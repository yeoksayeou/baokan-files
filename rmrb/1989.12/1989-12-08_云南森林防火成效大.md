Yunnan's forest fire prevention efforts have shown significant results. According to Xinhua News Agency in Kunming on December 7th, in recent years, the number of forest fires in Yunnan Province has decreased from over ten thousand cases per year to just over a thousand, and the affected area has reduced from hundreds of thousands of hectares to just a few thousand hectares. This achievement has recently been praised by the Ministry of Forestry.

Yunnan is one of the provinces most severely affected by forest fires in China. In 1979 alone, there were 12,874 forest fire incidents. Since 1986, various levels of leadership have strengthened forest protection and fire prevention work from multiple aspects, including personnel, funding, equipment, legal enforcement, and propaganda education. As a result, the incidence of forest fires has significantly decreased year by year. By this year's spring fire prevention period, the number of forest fires in the province had dropped to 1,522 cases, effectively preventing major forest fires.

    云南森林防火成效大
    据新华社昆明12月7日电　（记者赵维、谭亚原）近几年来，云南省森林火灾次数由每年上万起下降到千余起，受灾面积由几十万公顷下降到几千公顷，最近受到了林业部的表扬。
    云南是全国森林火灾最严重的省份。仅1979年一年就发生火灾12874起。1986年以后，各级领导从人员、资金、设备、法律及宣传教育等多方面强化护林防火工作，火灾发生率逐年大幅度下降。到今年春防期间，全省森林火灾次数下降至1522起，杜绝了特大森林火灾。
