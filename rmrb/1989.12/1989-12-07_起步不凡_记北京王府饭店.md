In early November, Mr. Sinaid, the chairman of the "World's Top Hotel Organization," visited the Beijing Wangfu Hotel for an inspection. Two days later, Mr. Sinaid's strict and demanding gaze showed approval and admiration. He stated: The Wangfu Hotel can be accepted as a member of this organization.

This hotel, designed and built to five-star standards, is located on the east side of the bustling Wangfujing Street in Beijing. The Eastern classical exterior design is seamlessly integrated with modern Western interior facilities. Upon entering the lobby, the grandeur of the white marble columns and the cascading waterfall, combined with the slow-moving elevator, make one feel as if entering a fairyland. The hotel's Italian, German, Japanese, and French restaurants offer authentic cuisine and service. Additionally, there is a comfortable and elegant coffee shop and restaurants serving Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine for guests.

Situated in the heart of the city, the "Wangfu" is conveniently located yet quiet. Over 500 rooms in ten different styles are characterized by luxury, tranquility, and comfort. All room equipment is controlled by computers. The highest-level presidential suite is also equipped with a private elevator, allowing direct access to the desired floor. Compared to many other high-end hotels in Beijing, the "Wangfu" stands out with its unique nightlife. The karaoke and dance halls operate until 2 a.m., attracting not only hotel guests but also officials from foreign embassies in China, businesspeople, experts, students, and even foreign staff working in other hotels.

This year, China's tourism industry has been generally sluggish. Many hotels in Beijing have resorted to lowering prices to attract customers. However, since the "Wangfu" began trial operations in March, room prices have remained stable, and the occupancy rate has steadily increased. Many customers who have visited China multiple times and stayed in various hotels in Beijing have become regular guests at the "Wangfu." An American expert working in Hebei Province visits Beijing every week and stays at the Wangfu Hotel. Later, even after he had an apartment in Beijing, he still visited the hotel every week for meals and entertainment. Many guests are reluctant to leave, and some have said, "I am satisfied with everything here. Next time I come to Beijing, I will stay at the 'Wangfu'." A foreign businessman traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing stayed at the hotel 19 times in nine months. Currently, the "Wangfu" has over 30% repeat customers.

The Wangfu Hotel has indeed made a promising start. The October 23 issue of the American magazine "Time" in its "Top Ten Hotels in Asia — Asia's Top Hotels Known for Their Excellent Service" featured the Beijing Wangfu Hotel.

Luxurious facilities, excellent service, and harmonious cooperation between Chinese and foreign staff are the secrets to the success of the Wangfu Hotel. The elegant deputy general manager, Cai Shaolong, introduced that the hotel's managers and employees come from over a dozen different countries and regions. Although their cultural backgrounds and educations vary, their goal of "creating first-class service" is completely aligned. Therefore, they have a harmonious relationship and work well together. He said, "The pursuit of perfect service is endless. We welcome more foreign friends to invest in and visit China, and we especially welcome them to 'Wangfu' to experience service with Eastern cultural characteristics." Deputy General Manager Dong Liguang expressed, "China's door to the outside world will not be closed, and we are full of confidence in the future of the hotel!"

    起步不凡
    ——记北京王府饭店
    本报记者　赖仁琼
    11月上旬，“世界一流饭店组织”主席诗奈德先生来北京王府饭店考察。两天之后，诗奈德先生那严格、苛刻的目光中透出了赞许和欣赏，他表示：可以接纳王府饭店为该组织的会员。
    这家按五星级标准设计建造的饭店位于繁华的北京王府井大街东侧。东方古典式外部造型与西方现代化的内部设施融为一体。走进大厅，富丽堂皇的白色大理石廊柱，飞流直下的瀑布，客人乘坐徐徐开动的电梯，犹如进入仙境。饭店的意大利餐厅、德国餐厅、日本餐厅、法国餐厅从菜式到服务都讲究正宗地道。此外，还有舒适优雅的咖啡厅和专为客人提供川菜、粤菜的餐厅。
    地处市中心的“王府”交通方便，但又闹中取静。十种不同式样的500多套客房都以豪华、幽静、舒适为特点。房内各种设备全用电脑控制。最高级的总统套房还装有私用电梯，可以直达所要去的楼层。与京城众多的高级饭店相比，“王府”的夜生活独具魅力。歌厅舞厅营业至凌晨两点，不仅住店客人喜欢光顾，连外国驻华使馆官员、驻京客商、外国专家、留学生以至在其他饭店工作的外籍员工，都愿来此听歌跳舞。
    今年，我国旅游业普遍不景气。京城的不少饭店便以降低价格来招徕客人。而“王府”自今年3月试营业以来，房价稳定，客房出租率逐月上升。一些数次来中国、曾先后在北京多家饭店住过的客人，如今不少成了“王府”的常客。一位在河北工作的美国专家，每星期回北京必住王府饭店。后来他在北京有了公寓，但也每周都来饭店吃饭、娱乐。不少客人离店时依依不舍，还有客人说：“我对这里的一切都很满意。下次来北京，我还要住‘王府’”。一位往返于香港、北京的外国客商，九个月里前后住店达19次之多。目前，“王府”的回头客达30％以上。
    王府饭店真可谓起步不凡。美国《时代周刊》在10月23日《亚洲十大饭店一览——亚洲一流饭店以精益求精的服务闻名于世》中就介绍了北京的王府饭店。
    豪华的设施、优良的服务和中、外方人员的愉快合作，是王府饭店成功的奥秘。温文尔雅的副总经理蔡绍龙介绍，饭店的经理、员工分别来自十几个不同的国家和地区。虽然大家的文化背景、所受教育不尽相同，但“创一流服务”的目标却完全一致。故彼此间关系融洽，配合默契。他说：“追求尽善尽美的服务永无止境。欢迎更多的外国朋友来中国投资、观光，更欢迎他们来‘王府’领略具有东方文化色彩的服务。”董礼恭副总经理则表示：“中国对外开放的大门不会关闭，我们对饭店的前景充满信心！”
