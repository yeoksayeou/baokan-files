The Fourth National Overseas Chinese Congress concluded today in Beijing. The newly elected chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Zhuāng Yánlín, called on all levels of the federation to work under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. He urged them to adhere to the basic line of focusing on economic development, upholding the four cardinal principles, and promoting reform and opening up. He also emphasized the need to rely on the support of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese. Following the spirit of "strengthening the organization, starting from scratch, developing real projects, maintaining extensive contacts, actively serving, and making more contributions," he urged efforts to improve the construction and reform of the federation. He called for striving to revitalize China and achieve national reunification.

The congress approved the revised "Charter of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese." The new charter stipulates that the federation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, is a national people's organization composed of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. It serves as a bridge and bond between the party and government and the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese. The federation takes the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" as the fundamental guideline for all its activities. It raises the banner of patriotism, actively and independently carries out work according to its own characteristics, and safeguards the legal rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese in the country. It also protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

The congress also approved the work report of Chairman Zhāng Guójī and passed a resolution to award certificates of honor to comrades who have worked in the federation for 30 years. It read a proposal by Zhuāng Mínglǐ and Zhāng Chúkūn to establish a "Overseas Chinese History Museum" in the capital.

The closing ceremony was presided over by Vice Chairman Guō Ruìrén of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.
