Our country has over 10 million severe mental patients, 80% of whom do not receive inpatient treatment. Mental illness is a major problem in the global medical community. It not only causes mental and economic pain and a heavy burden for the families of patients but also brings many difficulties to the social welfare system for the disabled. The prevention and treatment of mental illness has become an important social issue.

In the past, our country has used Western methods of forced treatment and suppressive drug therapy to treat mental illness, resulting in high relapse rates and the inability to achieve complete cures. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine has made new progress through the diagnosis of symptoms and causes, combined with the seven emotions and six desires, and the adjustment of the balance of the organs and qi. This has been recognized worldwide, but because traditional Chinese medicine does not have beds in Western hospitals, its academic value has not been fully realized.

Recently, we learned that a new type of traditional Chinese medicine psychiatric hospital has been established in Changge County, Henan Province—the Li Hao Traditional Chinese Medicine Psychiatric Hospital. This hospital, which combines traditional Chinese medicine as the main treatment and Western medicine as a supplement, is a first in our country. Li Hao, a self-taught young traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, established this hospital with the Henan Provincial Medical Psychology Association.

The hospital's features include a one-stop approach for chronic mental patients, providing inpatient treatment, rehabilitation, and reintegration into society. Outpatient diagnosis and confirmation are followed by inpatient treatment until clinical recovery is achieved. Patients then enter a rehabilitation period, engaging in regular collective living and learning, combined with psychological education and behavioral and emotional correction. This helps patients correctly analyze and criticize their conditions, and when they have the ability to prevent relapse, they enter a consolidation period and transfer to the hospital's rehabilitation workshop. Here, they undergo work therapy and intelligence training and cultivation. After regaining their intelligence, they return to society. Another feature is that, starting from charitable work, the hospital implements "free payment" for impoverished patients and even provides free treatment for impoverished patients and mentally ill individuals wandering the streets. Since 1985, when the hospital was established, it has provided approximately 80,000 yuan in free treatment for impoverished patients. Li Hao has donated all his personal assets to the hospital, allowing many mentally ill individuals wandering the streets to receive inpatient treatment. This has eased the pressure on the government's charitable welfare system and society.

Li Hao's entrepreneurial spirit and selfless dedication have moved the masses and received the attention and support of local party and government leaders at all levels. They have provided loans and hospital sites according to Li Hao's vision to build the inpatient department, but due to national economic difficulties and tight credit, the outpatient building, ward, rehabilitation workshop, and school construction have been halted. The hospital currently has only 150 beds, while 500 patients who have made appointments cannot receive timely inpatient treatment. The demand for inpatient treatment is very high. For this reason, we appeal to the party and government, as well as domestic and international people of goodwill who care about the fate of the Chinese nation, to provide strong support. Whether through donations, joint ventures, or loans, we hope to solve the difficulties faced by the Li Hao Traditional Chinese Medicine Psychiatric Hospital. This will help revitalize traditional Chinese medicine, promote the advantages and innovative spirit of our country's medicine in the field of mental illness, and lend a helping hand!

### 支持李浩大夫创办中医精神病院的举动

    支持李浩大夫创办中医精神病院的举动
    我国1000多万重性精神病人，80％得不到住院治疗。精神病是世界医学界的一个重大难题，它不仅给病人家属精神上、经济上增加了痛苦和巨大负担，同时也给社会残疾福利事业带来了许多困难。精神病的防治已成为重要的社会问题。
    我国对精神病的治疗，过去一直沿用西方的强迫性的治疗手段和抑制性的药物治疗，复发率高，不能彻底治愈。近些年来，中医通过辨证求因，结合七情六欲移情，调整脏腑气机的平衡，取得了新的进展，举世公认，但由于中医在西医院没有病床，使中医学术得不到充分发挥。
    最近，我们了解到，河南长葛县成立了一所新型的中医精神病院——李浩中医精神病院，以中医为主、西医为辅，这在我国是首创。李浩，一位自学成才的青年中医师，他与河南省医学心理学会创办了这所精神病院。
    医院的特点：对慢性精神病人实行住院治疗、疗养、康复、重返社会的一条龙的方法，门诊诊断确诊，住院治疗达到临床痊愈后，进入疗养期，进行规律性的集体生活学习，配合心理教育，行为情感矫正，使患者对自己的病情能够正确地分析与批判，当具备自觉预防复发能力时，进入巩固期转入医院康复工厂，进行工疗与智能的锻炼与培养，恢复智力后，再重返社会。另一特点是从慈善事业出发，对贫困户实行“自由交费”，甚而对贫困户及流落街头的精神病患者实行免费治疗。从1985年筹建以来，医院曾先后为贫困病人免费约8万余元。李浩同志为此事业将全部家产捐献给医院，使许多流落街头的精神病患者得以住院治疗，缓解了政府慈善福利事业和社会的压力。
    李浩的创业精神，舍己为人的高尚品质，感动了广大群众，得到了当地各级党政领导的重视和支持。他们拿出一定贷款和院址，按照李浩的设想建起了住院部，但由于国家经济困难银根紧缩，致使门诊楼、病区院、康复工厂、学校等建筑停工。医院目前仅设了150张床位，而预约的500名患者不能及时住院治疗，要求住院的呼声很大。为此，我们呼吁党和政府以及国内外各界关心中华民族子孙命运的仁人志士给予大力扶持，或资助、或联办、或贷款，解决李浩中医精神病院的困难，为振兴中医、发扬祖国医学在精神病领域的优势与创新精神，助一臂之力！
