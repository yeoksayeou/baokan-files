Farmers in Heze, Shandong Province, have become wealthy but not forgotten the state. In October alone, the Agricultural Bank system received repayments of nearly 20-year-old loans totaling 20 million yuan from them.

Located in the southwestern part of Shandong Province along the old course of the Yellow River, Heze is a well-known impoverished area. Although the situation improved after liberation, farmers remained impoverished for a long time and did not repay state loans. By 1978, the outstanding loan balance in the rural areas of the entire region had accumulated to over 100 million yuan.

Over the past decade of reform, the farmers in western Shandong have basically solved their food and clothing problems. However, some farmers, influenced by the "iron rice bowl" mentality, believed that they should not repay the loans because they had previously relied on state support. To address this situation, the Agricultural Bank in Heze organized staff to go deep into the countryside to encourage the masses to voluntarily repay their loans. In Sanduo Village, Dianhutun Township, Heze City, there was an overdue loan of 30,000 yuan for many years. After becoming wealthy through labor, the villagers had the ability to repay the loan, but many households had a mentality of expecting forgiveness and delayed repayment. The bank sent people to the village for discussions, explaining the current difficulties faced by the state, which touched the hearts of the farmers. They said, "When we were in difficulty, the state supported us with money from other places. Now it is our turn to repay and support the areas in difficulty." After their awareness was raised, the village's overdue principal and interest of more than 60,000 yuan were basically repaid. In Li Ji Township, Yuncheng County, 2.8 million yuan in loans were repaid in October alone.

One of the main reasons for the difficulty in repayment in some places is the lack of integrity among some cadres: some of the previous loans were spent by them; but during the "responsibility system" for sharing debts, they took on very little responsibility. The farmers were not satisfied and refused to repay. In Maozhuang Village, Anxing Township, Heze City, there was an overdue loan of more than 9,000 yuan. Due to the unfair distribution of debts when they were realized, the farmers were unwilling to take on the debt. The Agricultural Bank and the judicial department cooperated to reasonably distribute the entire debt among the village cadres and farmers. As a result, the farmers in the entire village repaid 6,000 yuan. The debts of the cadres of all previous terms amounted to more than 3,000 yuan, with over 1,000 yuan repaid on the spot. For the remaining small amount of loans and interest, a repayment plan has also been proposed.

    遇困难国家扶助　致富后想着国家
    菏泽农民积极还贷
    十月份归还贷款达二千万元
    本报讯　山东省菏泽地区农民致富不忘国家，仅今年10月份，农业银行系统就收到他们归还近20年的贷款2000万元。
    地处鲁西南黄河故道的菏泽地区，是有名的穷乡僻壤。解放后，这里的面貌虽有好转，但农民长期没有脱贫，对国家的贷款有借无还。截至1978年，全区农村贷款余额沉淀到1亿多元。
    改革10年，鲁西南农民的温饱问题基本得到解决。但有些农民由于受“大锅饭”的影响，认为过去吃国家“应该”，有钱也不想还贷款。针对这种情况，菏泽地区农业银行组织职工深入农村，启发群众自觉还款。菏泽市佃户屯乡沙沃村多年拖欠贷款3万元，劳动致富后已有能力还贷，可不少农户存有豁免心理，一直拖着不交。农行派人到村里座谈，讲清国家现在面临的困难，打动了农民的心。他们说：“咱困难时，国家拿其它地方的钱支援了我们，如今理应还上，支援困难地区。”认识提高后，该村的6万多元本息基本还清。郓城县李集乡，仅10月份就还贷28万元。
    有些地方出现还贷难的一个主要原因，是少数干部不廉洁：以前的贷款有些被他们花掉；可在“大包干”分担债务时，他们又很少承担，农民不满意，便顶着不还。菏泽市安兴乡姚庄村欠贷款9000多元，因落实债务时分配不公，农民不愿承担债务，农业银行和司法部门配合，把全部债务合理分给村干部和农民。结果，全村农民还款6000元。历届干部承担3000多元，当场还款1000多元。对剩下的少量贷款及利息，也提出了归还计划。　（段心强　杨全印　李信征）
