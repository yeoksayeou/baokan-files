Title: Why Do People Find the Dump Attractive

The dump is a treasure trove. Despite its dirtiness and disorder, it is still a rather attractive place. Near my residential building, there is a dump where many people come to take what they need every day. After retiring and staying at home with nothing to do, I often go there to watch the scene. Over time, I started picking things up myself. Among my fellow pickers, there are retired cadres and workers, elderly housewives, and young women. They each pick according to their different needs and interests: some pick paper scraps, plastic bags, small hardware, while others pick bread and fried dough sticks to feed pigs. I asked about a dozen people who pick pig feed. Most of them are from the suburbs of Beijing, farming on one hand and picking pig feed on the other. Some feed 5 or 10 pigs, and the most feed up to 30 pigs, making the dump their feedlot. Three young men from Henan rent a house in the suburbs of Beijing to raise 100 pigs, mainly relying on picking "feed" from hotels, restaurants, and the dump. Their annual income can reach 8,000 to 10,000 yuan. Other trash pickers say their income exceeds that of county-level or division-level cadres in government agencies, with each person earning about 300 yuan per month.

The dump is also a hub for waste. From late August to mid-October 1989, I spent an hour each day picking "trash." In two months, I picked up 250 pairs of shoes, mostly leather shoes, 60 pairs of slippers used only once, 80 bags of various kinds, over 200 napkins, 30-plus pieces of clothing, and 3 bags of fabric scraps, estimated to be worth 600 yuan. Nowadays, most families have only one child, so the old practice of passing down clothes from the eldest to the youngest is no longer common. When a child outgrows their shoes, they are simply thrown away. More than half of the shoes I picked were in good condition, with no visible defects, and it was a shame to throw them away. Some unspoiled, high-quality food was also discarded. Some hotels even threw away live eels and mooncakes as "trash." When I gave these mooncakes to the kitchen staff building a hotel, he sighed, "What a waste, just after the Mid-Autumn Festival, why throw away good mooncakes?" From what I have seen, the things in the dump are not all "trash"; there are indeed many usable, edible, and wearable items. This is truly shocking waste.

The dump is also a competitive arena. Originally, I thought that since the things in the dump are discarded, anyone who wants to pick them can do so. However, this is not the case. From my observations, all the "professional" trash pickers spend the whole day in the dump. Some enter the dump early in the morning, some stay all day without leaving the picking spot, and some use flashlights to search the dump at night. People often say this is "picking trash," but in reality, it is "grabbing trash." The more there is to pick in a dump, the more fiercely it is grabbed. Especially when a latecomer enters the territory marked by the early birds, a quarrel immediately breaks out, with flying spittle and hurtful words. Fortunately, there are plenty of things to pick in the dump, so even though they argue loudly and fiercely, the quarrelers never stop picking trash. I have often tried to mediate arguments, but I have never seen the quarrelers stop picking trash and start fighting. It can be said that this is a unique feature of "benign competition" in the dump!

### 垃圾场为何有吸引力

    垃圾场为何有吸引力
    垃圾场是聚宝盆。别看垃圾场脏和乱，它还是一个相当有吸引力的地方。我住的大楼附近有一个垃圾场，每天有不少人在垃圾堆里各取所需。离休后在家呆着没事干，我便经常到此看热闹。日子久了，也跟着拣起来。我的“同行”中，有离休老干部、老工人，有上了年纪的家庭妇女，也有年轻的媳妇。他们按着不同的需要和兴趣分别拣碎纸、塑料袋、小五金以及拣面包、油条喂猪。我询问了十几位拣猪食的人。他们多是北京近郊区的，一面种田，一面拣猪食，有的喂5头、10头、多者喂到30头，垃圾场成了他们的饲料场。河南来的3位男青年在京郊租房养了100头猪，主要是靠到宾馆、饭店及垃圾场上拣拾“饲料”。年收入可达8000元至1万元。其他捡破烂者的收入用他们自己的话来说，超过政府机关县团级干部的工资，每月每人能进300元。
    垃圾场又是浪费的集散地。1989年8月下旬到10月中旬，我每天用一个小时拣“破烂”，两个月的时间，我就拣了以皮鞋为主的各式各样的鞋子250双，一次用的拖鞋60双，各种提、挎包80个，各种餐巾200多条，衣服30多件，还有3麻袋布头，估计价值600元。现在每个小家庭大多是只生一个孩子，过去那种老大新老二旧缝缝补补给老三的情况没有了。孩子的脚大了鞋便扔掉了。我拣的鞋子一半以上有七八成新，看不出什么毛病，扔掉太可惜了。有一些没有变质的质量颇好的食品也被扔掉了。有的宾馆把不少活鳝鱼和月饼都当作“垃圾”扔出来了。当我把这些月饼送给在宾馆建房子的伙房炊事员时，他叹气说道：“造孽，真造孽，怎么刚过了中秋节，月饼不坏为啥就扔了呢？”就我亲眼所见，垃圾场上的东西并不都是“破烂”，实实在在是有不少可用、可食和可穿的东西。这实在是惊人的“高浪费”。
    垃圾场也是竞争场。原来我认为，既然垃圾场上都是扔的东西，那么谁愿捡谁捡就是了。其实不然。据我观察，凡是捡破烂的“专业户”，都是整天泡在垃圾场上的。有的一早就进入垃圾场，有的一天到晚也不离开捡破烂的点，有的夜里拿着手电筒在垃圾场上来回翻找。人们常说这是“捡破烂”的，实际上是“抢破烂”的。可捡的东西越多的垃圾场，抢得越凶。特别是后来者一但进入了先来者划好的圈子，顿时就爆发一场争吵，吐沫横飞，恶语伤人。好在垃圾场上可捡的东西多，虽然气势汹汹的大吵，大骂，但争吵者总是不停地捡破烂。我多次劝过吵架，但也从来没有看到争吵者停下捡破烂而大打出手的。可以称得上是“君子动口不动手”。这也算得上是垃圾场上“良性竞争”的一大特色吧！
