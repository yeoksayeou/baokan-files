China Ping An Insurance Company and the State Supervision Department recently investigated and handled the issue of Zhengzhou City Insurance Company falsifying records to obtain "advanced" honors and seriously violating financial discipline, resulting in the loss of state funds. The former manager of Zhengzhou City Insurance Company, Gao Tianxiu, was demoted.

According to materials provided by the State Supervision Department, Zhengzhou City Insurance Company and its affiliated branches, when handling insurance procedures for employees' personal insurance and family property insurance for enterprises, violated relevant regulations. They issued receipts for "enterprise property insurance fees" instead of receipts for personal insurance fees and family property insurance fees. This provided a way for the insured enterprises to illegally include the portion of personal insurance fees that should not enter the enterprise's production costs and family property insurance fees into the production costs, attracting enterprises to use a large amount of funds that should be turned over to the state treasury for insurance, turning a large amount of funds into off-book funds for enterprises, and causing damage to the state's economic interests. From January 1987 to June 1989, over two and a half years, the five district branches of Zhengzhou City Insurance Company used the illegal method of issuing insurance fee receipts to collect 3.296 million yuan in personal insurance fees and family property insurance fees, causing a large amount of funds that should be turned over to the state treasury to be lost.

In 1987, Zhengzhou City Insurance Company adopted the method of not collecting the principal of the insurance fee but only collecting the interest of the insurance fee for three years of storage, and sold 738,000 difficult-to-sell personal insurance tickets in batches to enterprises, collecting a total of 5.711 million yuan in interest. These interests were then calculated as the principal of the insurance fee of 22.169 million yuan and entered into the account.

For this reason, China Ping An Insurance Company, with the approval of the State Supervision Department, decided to give Gao Tianxiu, the former manager of Zhengzhou City Insurance Company and current chief economist of Henan Province Insurance Company, an administrative demotion, reducing him from the rank of deputy bureau level to the rank of section chief level. It was also suggested that he be given a serious warning within the party and that his "May 1st Labor Medal" and the title of "Excellent Manager" be revoked. The Henan Province Insurance Company was ordered to conduct a thorough self-examination of its leadership responsibilities and to thoroughly rectify the business work of Zhengzhou City Insurance Company.

    郑州保险公司违反财经纪律
    前任经理受到行政降职处分
    本报北京12月18日讯　中国人民保险公司和国家监察部最近查处了郑州市保险公司弄虚作假骗取“先进”荣誉、严重违反财经纪律致使国家资金流失的问题。郑州市保险公司前任经理高天修受到行政降职处分。
    据监察部提供的材料，郑州市保险公司及其所属支公司在为企业办理职工人身保险和家庭财产保险的投保手续时，违反有关规定，将人身保险费和家庭财产保险费收据开成“企业财产保险费”收据，从而为投保企业将人身保险费中不应进入企业生产成本的部分和家庭财产保险费“合法”地摊入生产成本提供了方便，吸引企业把大量应上交国家财政的资金用于投保，使大笔资金成了企业的帐外资金，国家的经济利益受到了损害。在1987年1月至1989年6月的两年半时间里，郑州市保险公司所属的5个城区支公司，用违章开保险费收据的不正当手段，收取人身保险费和家庭财产保险费329.6万多元，造成企业应上交国家财政的资金大量流失。
    1987年，郑州市保险公司采取不收保险费本金，只收取保险费3年存储利息的方法，将推销困难的73.8万多份人身保险奖券成批“销售”给企业，共收取利息571.1万多元，然后再将这些利息推算成保险费本金2216.9万多元入帐。
    为此，中国人民保险公司征得监察部同意，决定给予负有主要领导责任的郑州市保险公司前任经理、现任河南省保险公司总经济师高天修行政降职处分，由副厅局级降为正处级，并建议给予党内严重警告处分，撤销其“五一”劳动奖章获得者和“优秀经营管理者”称号；责成河南省保险公司深刻检查应负的领导责任，并对郑州市保险公司的业务工作进行彻底整顿。（简　轩）
