	Strengthening the Rural Land Management Team
	State Land Administration Bureau, Chen Shunzeng

	"Up there are a thousand lines, down here is one needle." Land management work ultimately needs to be implemented by rural land management personnel. Currently, there are many problems with the rural land management team that need to be addressed urgently.

	First, the workload is heavy, but the personnel are few. In China, 70% of the land is managed by rural areas. According to regulations, rural land management personnel have complex and specific tasks, with many things to do and many threads to follow, each of which needs to be implemented. Currently, various places across the country have established rural land management institutions or assigned a certain number of land management personnel. However, the numbers are seriously insufficient, and the development is very uneven. Preliminary statistics show that among nearly 100,000 rural-level units nationwide, there are currently only about 40,000 land management personnel, and more than 60% of them are part-time or temporary workers. The number of personnel is extremely mismatched with the tasks at hand.

	Second, there are concerns about the future, and there is a lack of stability. Among the current land management personnel, most are "temporary workers," that is, what rural land management personnel often refer to as "peasant cadres." Most of them are dedicated to the land management cause. However, as they age, their concerns about the future are increasing. Due to some specific problems that have not been solved, many have changed jobs. According to a survey in Shenyang's Yuhong District, the district has 16 townships, with 20 land management personnel assigned, but 8 of them changed jobs last year alone.

	Third, there is a lack of authority, and law enforcement is difficult. Since rural land management personnel are temporarily hired, many land management personnel feel they lack authority and dare not enforce the law boldly. This is manifested in two ways: first, they dare not resist improper practices from the leadership, and second, they fear retaliation from those they manage. Currently, threats, intimidation, and assaults on land management personnel occur from time to time.

	Fourth, there is a lack of funds, and there are many difficulties.

	The above problems, apart from the fact that the land management institutions have been established for a relatively short time and have a weak foundation, are largely due to some leaders and departments not truly valuing this work. When it comes to issues like personnel quotas and funds, they push the land issue to the back burner. Therefore, to establish a stable and effective rural land management team, it is necessary to genuinely address the specific issues related to land management work.

    加强乡镇土地管理队伍

    “上边千条线，下边一根针”。土地管理工作最终都要通过乡镇土地管理人员去贯彻落实。目前，乡镇土地管理队伍还存在不少问题急待解决。
    一、任务重、人员少。我国70％的土地由乡镇管理。按照规定，乡镇土地管理人员工作具体复杂，事情多、头绪乱，件件都要去落实。目前，全国各地相继建立了乡镇土地管理机构或配备了一定数量的土地管理人员。但是，数量严重不足，发展也很不平衡。据初步统计，全国近十万个乡镇级单位中，目前仅有土地管理人员约4万多人，而且兼职和临时人员占60％以上。人员与任务极不适应。
    二、后顾忧、心不安。在现有土地管理人员中，大部分是“临时工”，也就是乡镇土地管理员自己常讲的“泥腿子”干部。他们之中的绝大部分人，都能对土地管理事业尽心尽职。但随着年龄的增长，后顾之忧越来越多。由于一些具体问题一直解决不了，不少人改换了“门庭”。据沈阳市于洪区调查，该区16个乡镇，配备土地管理人员20名，去年一年就变动了8个。
    三、腰不硬、执法难。由于乡镇土地管理员是临时聘用，所以不少土地管理人员总觉腰不硬，不敢大胆执法。其表现一是对来自领导方面的不正之风不敢抵制，二是怕被管对象打击报复。现在，威胁要挟殴打土地管理人员的事情时有发生。
    四、缺经费、困难多。
    上述问题，除开土地管理机构成立时间相对较短，底子不厚原因外，很大程度上是一些领导、部门并没有真正重视这项工作造成的，一碰到编制、经费这些实质问题，就把土地问题摆在末尾。因此，要建立一支稳定、有效的乡镇土地管理队伍，必须切实解决有关土地管理工作的具体问题。
