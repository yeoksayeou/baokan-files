News photography, with its vivid and believable images, reflects social reality, reports on the new achievements, new things, and new situations in the construction and reform of socialism, and is deeply loved by readers. To strengthen the dissemination of this form of visual news, and to encourage photographers to take more and better news photographs, our newspaper will, from January 1 to March 31, 1990, jointly host a news photography competition with Qingdao Television Factory.

The content and themes of the competition photographs are not restricted, but they must have news value, be true to life, vivid in imagery, have a sense of being on the scene, and have a breath of life. The text descriptions should be concise. Please submit eight-inch black-and-white prints, clearly marking the time and place of the photograph. Send two copies to the Photography Department of the People's Daily in Beijing (Postal Code 100733), clearly marking "News Photography Competition" on the envelope, and affixing sufficient postage.
