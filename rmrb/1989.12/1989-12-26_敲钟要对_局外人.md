How to Cherish Every Inch of Land?

    Ring the Bell for "Outsiders"
    MENG Qingqian, Shandong Province, Ju County

    The strategy for saving land lies in coordination. Just like other endeavors, "going it alone" often yields minimal results. This is a lesson from history.

    China's land crisis has been brewing for many years. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, per capita arable land has been reduced by more than half. The issue of land crisis is not a recent one; every year, there are calls to conserve land, yet every year, large areas of land are wasted. Apart from factors related to functional departments, this might also be the result of "going it alone."

    In China's land management framework, from a formal perspective, land conservation is the responsibility of the land management departments and the agricultural departments. Although it is elevated to the level of national policy, the formulation and implementation of specific measures largely depend on functional departments. From the perspective of "outsiders," their work assessments and systems barely touch upon the issue of land conservation. This leads to a lack of urgency in their thinking. They are aware of the potential land crisis, but compared to the achievements and personal interests of their industry, they consider it insignificant.

    In reality, in many places, the phenomenon of "outsiders" not managing internal affairs exists to varying degrees. For example, when people see land conservation slogans on streets, walls, and fields, many think, "Ah, the land management bureau is making noise again." This way, they naturally exclude themselves from the matter. In the planning and systems of industries outside the bureau, the issue of land conservation is often also handed over to functional departments. This, in fact, creates a situation where "selling shrimp doesn't involve selling fish."

    How to mobilize "outsiders" to cherish land? The first step is to re-examine the meaning of the national policy, making various industries clearly understand that land conservation is a matter for the whole nation and cannot be divided into insiders and outsiders. Secondly, when evaluating the work of various industries and departments, land conservation should be considered an important aspect. Additionally, industries outside the bureau should also consider land conservation when formulating plans and systems. In recent years, Ju County in Shandong Province has decided to solve the problem of "going it alone," emphasizing that the Party, government, industry, culture, education, and commerce must all pay attention to land conservation. The entire county has formed a coordinated land conservation pattern where everyone from top to bottom and left to right is involved. The county's science and technology department, in its research on agricultural development, regards soil improvement as an important means of cherishing land, and has launched a "grain, grass, and livestock" technological breakthrough. The organic matter content in 20,000 mu of farmland in the breakthrough area has increased from 0.74% to 1.13%. Last winter and this spring, the county carried out a large-scale paid use of residential land, with more than 6,100 farmers who had planned to build new houses withdrawing their applications, saving 1,800 mu of arable land with just this one measure. The county's industrial department, when adjusting the structure of rural industries, not only considers economic benefits but also land conservation issues. This year, it ordered 30 brick kilns to stop production, returning 420 mu of arable land.

    敲钟要对“局外人”
    山东省莒县　孟庆谦
    节地之策在于匹配。像干其它事业一样，“孤军作战”往往收效甚微，这是历史的经验之谈。
    我国的土地危机已潜在好多年了，建国后的40年中人均耕地减少了一半多。提出土地危机并非近一两年的事，年年在喊节约用地，年年都出现大面积费地、荒地的现象。这点，除了职能部门的因素之外，也许还是“孤军作战”带来的结果。
    在我国的土地管理格局中，从形式上，节地惜地由土管部门和农业部门负责。尽管提到国策高度，但具体措施的拟定和实施，大都靠职能部门。在“局外人”看来，他们自己的工作考核和工作制度，几乎一点也不牵扯节地、惜地问题。这就造成思想上没有紧迫感。他们也认识到土地潜在的危机，但与行业的工作成果和切身利益相比，便觉得无关紧要了。
    事实上，在不少地方，“局外人”不管局内事的现象不同程度地存在着。诸如看到街道、墙面和田园里的节地标语，很多人会想，“吆，土管局又在造声势啦。”这样就把自己理所当然地划在了局外。在局外行业的工作计划和工作制度上也是如此，常常把节地、惜地问题也丢给了职能部门。这就在事实上造成了“卖虾不管卖鱼的”。
    怎样调动“局外人”珍惜土地的积极性呢？首要的是重审国策的含义，让各行各业都明确认识，节地、惜地是全民的事，不能分局内局外；其次，在考核各行业、部门工作时，把节地、惜地作为一条重要内容；另外，作为局外的各行各业，在制定计划和制度时，都要考虑节地问题。近几年，山东省莒县下决心解决“孤军作战”问题，强调党、政、工、文、学、商都要注意节地，全县形成了上下左右齐关注的配套节地格局。县科技部门在研究种植业开发中，把培肥地力当作珍惜土地的重要手段，开展了“粮草牧”科技攻关。攻关区2万亩农田的有机质含量由以前的0.74％上升为1.13％。去冬今春，这个县大规模开展了民用宅基有偿使用，有6100多个原打谱建新房的农户收回建房申请，仅这一项节约耕地1800亩。这个县工业部门在调整乡村工业结构时，不仅参考经济效益，而且考虑节地问题，今年责令30处砖窑厂停产，复还耕地420亩。
