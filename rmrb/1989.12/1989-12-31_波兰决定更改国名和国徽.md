Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 29th.

Poland's parliament passed a constitutional amendment on December 29th, deciding to restore the country's name and emblem to what they were before the establishment of the people's regime.

According to this constitutional amendment, the People's Republic of Poland will be renamed the Republic of Poland. The national emblem will be changed from a "white eagle under a red background" to a "crowned white eagle under a red background."

According to a report by the Polish News Agency, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party in the parliament expressed his disagreement with this proposal, stating that "restoring the old is not the wish of the Polish people."

    波兰决定更改国名和国徽
    新华社华沙12月29日电　波兰议会29日通过一项宪法修正案，决定恢复人民政权成立前的波兰国名和国徽。
    根据这项宪法修正案，波兰人民共和国改名为波兰共和国，波兰国徽则由“红色天幕下的白鹰”恢复为过去的“红色天幕下戴皇冠的白鹰”。
    据波通社报道，波兰统一工人党议员在议会发言时对此项提案表示异议，认为复旧“不是波兰人的愿望”。
