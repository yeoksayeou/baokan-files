An era's great person has passed – Remembering Dolores Ibárruri

On the morning of November 13, I turned on the radio as usual to listen to the Spanish radio broadcast. When I heard the news of the passing of Chairman Ibárruri, I couldn't believe my ears. I immediately recorded the news and listened to it over and over again… On November 12, 1989, the renowned warrior of the international communist movement and the chairperson of the Spanish Communist Party, Dolores Ibárruri, completed her life's journey at the age of 94 years and 338 days, passing away at the Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid.

Dolores Ibárruri is "the granddaughter of a miner, the daughter of a miner, the wife of a miner, the sister of a miner."

In April 1920, the Spanish Communist Party was established. As one of the founders, Ibárruri dedicated her entire life to the international communist movement. She was imprisoned multiple times. During her brave struggle against Spanish fascism, Ibárruri shouted slogans such as "Not one step forward for fascism" and "Rather a hero's widow than a coward's wife." After Franco's dictatorship took power, Ibárruri was forced into exile, continuing her fight abroad until she returned to her homeland in 1977 after 38 years of absence.

Ibárruri was a renowned communist warrior and also an ordinary person. She had six children, but due to the harsh living and working conditions, only two survived: her son Rubén and her daughter Amaya. During the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, 22-year-old Rubén joined the Red Army and died in the battle to defend Stalingrad on September 3, 1942. From then on, only her daughter Amaya accompanied her and saw her through her life of struggle.

Chairman Ibárruri had deep feelings for China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people. She visited China twice. In 1956, she led the Spanish Communist Party delegation to attend the 8th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and had a cordial meeting with comrades Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De. In her memoirs, she wrote: "The 8th Congress was very moving… Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De received us. These three people each have their own characteristics: Mao is a person who amazingly combines a politician, a military strategist, and a poet; he is thoughtful and very kind to us. Zhou Enlai is very lively and humorous, his eyes sparkle with intelligence, and he can speak fluent French. Zhu De, this old warrior who participated in the Long March, respects us and regards us as comrades. They introduced to us the situation in China, the great developments achieved, and the serious difficulties faced. They carefully inquired about the progress of the anti-Franco struggle in Spain, about our party, and the situation of our people."

In 1959, Ibárruri again led the Spanish Communist Party delegation to participate in the 10th anniversary celebrations of our country and visited Yan'an, even sleeping in the cave where Commander-in-Chief Zhu De once lived.

I first met Ibárruri in May 1980. In a modest apartment in Madrid, she happily reminisced about her visits to China and invited us to her hometown of the Basque Country, singing revolutionary songs from her youth. At that time, this seasoned revolutionary was like a kind mother. As we parted, she repeatedly asked us to convey her greetings to the Chinese people.

Later, during my work in Spain, I had more opportunities to meet her. At that time, Chairman Ibárruri was nearly 90 years old, but she still insisted on going to the Spanish Communist Party Central Committee every day. Her office was a room of about 20 square meters, with two desks, one for Ibárruri and one for her secretary, Falcón, and a set of three-piece sofa and a small coffee table, very simple.

I remember that in 1985, when the People's Publishing House published the Chinese translation of Chairman Ibárruri's "Memoirs of a Passion," I told her the news and asked her to write a few words for Chinese readers. A week later, her secretary delivered the typed manuscript of Ibárruri's "To the Chinese Readers." The old lady affectionately recounted, "...Years pass, and many things also fade from memory, but my brief visits to the People's Republic of China several decades ago... are unforgettable."

Ibárruri understood that the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of different countries support each other. "During the intense period of the Spanish Civil War, we received a warm telegram from Mao Zedong and Zhu De on behalf of the Chinese people, which I still remember vividly. Greetings from fighting China gave great encouragement to our armed forces."

"In 1949, I was seriously ill in a sanatorium in the Soviet Union. The news of the liberation of Shanghai reached my sickbed. The Communist Party and the people's 30-year-long heroic struggle to smash the shackles of imperialist oppression reached its highest point. I immediately felt that this historic victory drove all revolutionaries to live on, to be optimists, and to be full of confidence in the victory of our cause."

These heartfelt words fully reflect Chairman Ibárruri's sincere feelings for the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people.

In November 1984, Chairman Ibárruri learned that Chairman Li Xiannian would visit Spain and expressed her desire to meet with Chairman Li to reminisce about their friendship.

It was a drizzly evening when Chairman Ibárruri, accompanied by the General Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party, arrived at the Chinese Embassy in Spain. Chairman Li Xiannian, who was waiting in the hall, immediately stepped forward to greet her. The two revolutionary leaders warmly shook hands and embraced, expressing their combat friendship and mutual respect. That day, the two elders reminisced about their past struggles and envisioned a more beautiful communist future together.

That meeting was Chairman Ibárruri's last with our country's leaders. In the following days, although many Chinese comrades visited Spain, because of her advanced age, the Chinese comrades did not want to disturb her again.

Today, although this great person of the era has left us, her precious qualities and her appearance and smile will forever remain in my heart.

    一位时代伟人去了
    ——忆伊巴露丽
    游长江
    11月13日清晨，我像往常一样打开收音机，收听西班牙电台的广播。当我听到伊巴露丽主席逝世的消息时，我真不敢相信自己的耳朵，马上把新闻录了下来，听了一遍又一遍……1989年11月12日，国际共产主义运动的著名战士、西班牙共产党主席多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽走完了她人生的历程——94年又338天，病逝于马德里的拉蒙·依卡哈尔医院。
    多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽“是矿工的孙女、矿工的女儿、矿工的妻子、矿工的姐妹。”
    1920年4月，西班牙共产党成立。作为创始人之一的伊巴露丽，从此将自己的整个生命与国际共产主义运动紧密结合在一起。她曾多次被捕入狱。在同西班牙法西斯主义进行英勇斗争时，伊巴露丽以洪亮的声音高喊出“不让法西斯前进一步”、“宁做英雄的寡妇，不做胆小鬼的妻子”等口号。佛朗哥独裁上台后，伊巴露丽被迫流亡国外继续战斗，直到1977年才回到阔别38年的祖国。
    伊巴露丽是一位著名的共产主义战士，也是一个普通的人。她生有六个子女，但由于生活和工作环境的艰苦只活下了两个：儿子鲁文和女儿阿玛娅。在德寇侵略苏联时，年仅22岁的鲁文参加了红军，并在1942年9月3日牺牲在保卫斯大林格勒的战斗中。从那时起，只有女儿阿玛娅陪伴着她，并送她走完了斗争的一生。
    伊巴露丽主席对中国、中国共产党、中国人民有着深厚的感情，曾两次来我国访问。1956年，她率西班牙共产党代表团参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会时，亲切会见了毛泽东、周恩来、朱德等同志。在回忆录中她写道：“第八次代表大会是很感人的。……毛泽东、周恩来、朱德接见了我们，这三个人各有特点：毛是一位在自己身上把政治家、军事家、诗人惊人地融为一体的人物，他善于思考，对我们非常亲切。周恩来很活跃、很诙谐，眼睛闪烁着机敏的目光，他能讲一口流利的法语。朱德，这位参加过长征的老战士，他很敬佩我们，把我们看作战友。他们向我们介绍了中国的情况，取得的巨大发展和存在的严重困难。他们详细地了解西班牙反佛朗哥斗争的进展，了解我们党，我国人民的情况。”
    1959年，伊巴露丽又率西班牙共产党代表团参加了我国国庆十周年活动，并到延安参观，还睡在当年朱德总司令住过的窑洞里。
    我第一次见到伊巴露丽是1980年5月。在马德里一所普通公寓的四间套房里，她非常高兴地回忆访问中国的日子，还请我们到她的家乡巴斯克去作客，并高兴地给我们唱起革命年代的歌曲。那时，这位久经考验的革命家就像一位慈祥的母亲。我们告别时，她再三嘱咐我们向中国人民转达她的问候。
    后来，我在西班牙工作期间，与她见面的机会就多了。当时，伊巴露丽主席已近90高龄，但每天仍坚持到西班牙共产党中央委员会上班。她的办公室是20多平米的房间，放两个办公桌，一个是伊巴露丽的，一个是她的秘书法尔贡的，此外还有一套三件的沙发和一个小茶几，十分简朴。
    记得1985年人民出版社出版伊巴露丽主席的《热情之花回忆录》中译本时，我曾将这一消息告诉她，并请她为中国读者写几句话。一周之后，她的秘书送来了打印的伊巴露丽的《致中国读者》的稿子。老人深情地述说：“……岁月在流逝，许多事情也随之从记忆中消失，然而在我几十年前几度对中华人民共和国进行的短暂访问……却终生难忘。”
    伊巴露丽懂得，各国人民的革命斗争是相互支持的。“在西班牙内战战事犹酣的时期，我们收到了毛泽东和朱德同志代表中国人民给我们发来的亲切的声援电报，至今我还记忆犹新。来自战斗的中国的问候，给了我们的人民武装力量以巨大的鼓舞。”
      “1949年我因身患重病，在苏联一家疗养院养病，当时上海解放的消息传到我的病榻前。决心砸烂帝国主义压迫枷锁的共产党和人民长达30年的英勇斗争达到了最高潮。我立即感到这一历史性胜利驱使一切革命者要活下去，要做乐观主义者，要对我们事业的胜利充满信心。”
    这些充满感情的话语，充分体现了伊巴露丽主席对中国革命、中国人民的诚挚感情。
    1984年11月，伊巴露丽主席知道李先念主席将访问西班牙时，向我国驻西班牙大使馆提出要和李主席共叙友谊。
    那是一个蒙蒙细雨的傍晚，伊巴露丽主席在西班牙共产党总书记的陪同下乘车来到中国驻西班牙大使馆。迎候在门厅前的李先念主席立即迎上前去，二位革命领导人热烈握手、拥抱，以表他们之间的战斗友谊和相互敬重之情。那天，二老在一起共同回忆战斗历程，憧憬更加美好的共产主义未来。
    那次会见是伊巴露丽主席同我国领导人的最后一次会面。在以后的日子里，虽然有不少中国同志访问西班牙，但因她年事已高，中国同志都不忍心再打搅她。
    今天，这位时代伟人虽然已离开了我们，但是她的宝贵品质和她的音容笑貌，却永远留在我的心中。
