Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 3rd.

Chen Junsheng, a member of the State Council, today stressed at the closing of the National Conference on the Exchange of Experiences in Comprehensive Agricultural Development that efforts must be made to ensure a bumper harvest next year. He emphasized the need to grasp every task and do a good job in comprehensive agricultural development and all rural work. From top to bottom, all sectors must strive to ensure a bumper harvest next year. Starting now, every day and every task must be seized, with a sense of urgency and a spirit of seizing the initiative. Breakthrough work efficiency and higher work quality must be achieved to ensure new breakthroughs in grain and cotton production.

Chen Junsheng pointed out that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng had met with the provincial leaders attending the conference and given important instructions, providing important guiding principles for comprehensive agricultural development and rural work nationwide. They have clarified some major policies in rural work. Local authorities should study these instructions carefully, understand them deeply, and implement them in accordance with local conditions.

Chen Junsheng, in connection with the experiences and actual work of comprehensive development in various places, said that the potential for comprehensive agricultural development nationwide is enormous. However, comprehensive agricultural development is a systematic project that cannot be achieved overnight or easily. It requires a lot of work and long-term persistence to achieve greater results. In the future, two aspects of the effect should be noted in comprehensive agricultural development: on the one hand, make good use of existing resources to increase per-unit area yield, and at the same time, develop and utilize new agricultural resources to form new comprehensive productivity. On the other hand, with the development of rural productivity, production relations will inevitably change. We should seriously summarize and promote the new experiences that have emerged in practice. Gradually establish the rural service system, improve the dual management system, which may be a direction for promoting and deepening rural reform, but do not rush into it, and pay attention to summarizing and guiding.

Chen Junsheng hopes that local authorities will further strengthen the construction of rural grassroots organizations. He said that the tasks of rural grassroots cadres are arduous. Most grassroots organizations are effective, but there are a few that are not sound or effective. With the arrival of the nationwide wave of agricultural development, the requirements for rural grassroots organizations are getting higher and higher. Therefore, this problem is becoming more urgent and important.

The seven-day conference received high attention from the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Leaders from all over the country and relevant state departments exchanged experiences in comprehensive agricultural development, analyzed the current situation and problems in rural work, and studied and solved some urgent problems in agricultural development. The conference reaffirmed that the relevant policies formulated in the past for comprehensive agricultural development work remain valid: grain produced after the treatment and transformation of medium and low-yield fields and grain produced on newly reclaimed arable land will not be subject to contract procurement for five years, and newly reclaimed arable land will be exempt from agricultural tax for five years; the state will issue a portion of interest-subsidized loans to support comprehensive agricultural development projects; the state will continue to invest in large water conservancy projects such as rivers, and after completion, they will be used for a fee, gradually recovering part of the investment; in the distribution of fertilizers and other agricultural production materials, appropriate consideration will be given.

    陈俊生希望各地夺取明年丰收向前抢
    切实抓紧每项工作  搞好农业综合开发
    本报北京12月3日讯　新华社记者王言彬、本报记者陈健报道：国务委员陈俊生今天在全国农业综合开发经验交流会结束时强调：要按照十三届五中全会精神，努力搞好农业综合开发，做好农村各项工作。上上下下，各行各业一定要千方百计夺取明年丰收。从现在起，就要抓紧每一天，做好每一项工作，要有紧迫感和向前抢的精神，以突破性的工作效率、以更高的工作质量来保证实现粮棉生产的新突破。
    陈俊生同志指出，江泽民总书记和李鹏总理接见了参加会议的各省负责同志并作了重要指示，为全国农业综合开发和农村工作提出了重要的指导思想，明确了农村工作中一些重大的方针政策。各地要认真学习，深刻理解，结合本地实际情况，认真贯彻、落实。
    陈俊生结合各地综合开发的经验和工作实际说，全国综合农业开发，潜力很大。但搞好农业综合开发，是个系统工程，不是一朝一夕，也不是轻而易举的事情，需要做大量工作，长期坚持，才能搞出更大效果。在今后的农业综合开发中，要注意好两个方面的效应：一方面，利用好现有资源，提高单位面积产量，同时开发和利用新的农业资源，形成新的综合生产力。另一方面，随着农村生产力的发展，必然引起生产关系的变化。我们要认真总结、推广实践中出现的新鲜经验。逐步把农村服务体系建立起来，完善双层经营体制，这可能是推进和深化农村改革的一个方向，但不要一哄而起，要注意总结和引导。
    陈俊生希望镑地要进一步加强农村基层组织建设。他说，农村基层干部工作任务艰巨。绝大多数基层组织是得力的，但也有少数不健全不得力。随着全党全国大办农业热潮的到来，对农村基层组织的要求越来越高了。所以，这个问题就显得更迫切，更重要。
    这次为期7天的会议得到了党中央和国务院的高度重视，来自全国各地和国家有关方面的负责人交流了农业综合开发的经验，分析了当前农村工作的形势和问题，研究和解决了农业发展中的一些紧迫问题。会议重申了在农业综合开发工作中，过去制定的有关政策继续有效：治理改造中低产田后增产的粮食和新开垦耕地生产的粮食，五年内不交合同定购粮，新开垦的耕地五年免征农业税；国家发放一部分贴息贷款，支持农业综合开发项目；江河等大型水利工程，国家继续投资，建成后有偿使用，逐步收回一部分投资；在分配化肥等农用生产资料方面给予适当照顾。
