High-definition television is still in its infancy, but Western Europe, Japan, and the United States have already begun a fierce competition for its future market.

High-definition television is the next generation of television, and its widespread adoption is expected to occur by the end of this century. Existing televisions typically have images composed of 120,000 to 180,000 pixels, whereas high-definition television has 700,000 pixels. This type of television has a wide screen and a clear, bright picture, with an effect similar to that of a movie theater. The future market for high-definition television is expected to be a multi-billion-dollar market, and Western Europe, Japan, and the United States are all developing high-definition television technology, none willing to let the other monopolize this new technology. Even with mass production, the current design makes the price remain high, and a series of improvements are still needed to reduce the cost to an appropriate level.

Japan is far ahead in the development of high-definition television, having started research 20 years ago and investing tens of billions of dollars. The Japanese standard for high-definition television has been successfully tested and is being broadcast in the country. Sony's entry into Hollywood indicates that Japan intends to take the lead and capture the U.S. market.

Western Europe is not willing to fall behind. Five years ago, it included the development of high-definition television technology in the "Eureka" plan, investing $200 million, with 30 companies participating. Western Europe currently has 12 million televisions, and to avoid being suddenly phased out, Europe is adopting a phased, step-by-step transition approach to allow viewers to gradually adapt. The first step is to modify existing televisions by adding a circuit to make the image clearer and eliminate flicker. The second step is compatibility, where it can be compatible with both ordinary televisions and VCRs, and provide high-quality images and digital sound. The third step is a wide screen, giving viewers a movie theater-like experience. The wide-screen high-definition television is scheduled to be used at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

The United States started late in the development of high-definition television technology and invested less, with a total investment of less than $100 million. The U.S. Electronics Industry Association warns: If the United States cannot control 10% of the high-definition television market, it will lose 50% of the semiconductor market. The electronics industry is the largest manufacturing industry in the United States, with planned revenues of $300 billion in 1989. A recent U.S. report predicts that if the United States fails in the high-definition television competition, by 2010, the United States will lose 2 million jobs, and the trade deficit will increase by $225 billion annually.

Japan is concerned that if the Japanese standard for high-definition television captures the U.S. market, it may provoke American trade protectionism. Therefore, Japan proactively invites U.S. electronics companies to participate in the production of Japanese-standard high-definition television chips.

The United States has 160 million televisions. The Federal Communications Commission has ruled that the high-definition television standard chosen by the United States must be compatible with the existing television system. The step-by-step approach to achieving high-definition television adopted by Western Europe itself is a challenge to Japan. To compete for the U.S. market, Western Europe, on the one hand, is lobbying and communicating with the Federal Communications Commission, the decision-making body, and on the other hand, is inviting U.S. electronics companies to participate in the production of European-standard high-definition television.

In this competition, the United States seems to have conceded defeat, willing to provide chips for Japanese and Western European high-definition televisions. However, many Americans are not willing to accept defeat. They believe that the U.S. electronics and computer industry has a significant advantage, and the United States still has the conditions to catch up. According to experts, high-definition television will be officially launched in 1995. The United States is a large potential market, and if it is occupied by Japan, the contradictions between Europe and Japan will further intensify.

    欧日美角逐未来电视市场
    刘绪民
    高清晰度电视尚在襁褓中，西欧、日本和美国便对它的未来市场展开了激烈的争夺。
    高清晰度电视是下一代电视，普及这种电视乃是本世纪末的事。现存的电视机的图像通常是由12—18万个象素构成，高清晰度电视则是由70万个象素构成。这种电视屏幕宽阔，画面清晰明亮，其效果如同电影院一样。未来的高清晰度电视市场将是一个数百亿美元的大的潜在市场，西欧、日本和美国三家都在发展高清晰度电视技术，谁也不肯让哪一家垄断这一新的技术。按目前的设计，即使大批量生产，价格依然昂贵，为使成本降低到适当水平，仍有一系列改进工作要做。
    日本在发展高清晰度电视方面遥遥领先，早在20年前便开始研制，投资十几亿美元。日本制式的高清晰度电视已试制成功，并在国内试播。索尼打入好莱坞表明，日本企图先下手为强，抢占美国市场。
    西欧不甘落后，5年前已把发展高清晰度电视技术列入“尤里卡”计划，投入2亿美元，共有30家企业参与。全西欧现拥有1200万台电视机，为避免突然一下子被淘汰，欧洲采取分阶段、分步骤过渡的办法，使观众有个逐渐适应的过程。第一步：改造现存电视机，加进一块附加电路，使图像清晰和消除闪烁。第二步：兼容式，既可兼容普通电视机和录像机，又可提供优质图像和数字音响。第三步：宽屏幕，给观众以电影院式的画面。宽屏幕高清晰度电视计划于1992年在巴塞罗那的奥运会上投入使用。
    美国在发展高清晰度电视技术上起步晚，且投入少，总投资不足1亿美元。美国电子工业协会惊呼：美国假若控制不了10％的高清晰度电视市场，美国便将失去50％的半导体市场。电子工业是美国最大的制造行业，1989年计划收入3千亿美元。美国最近一份报告预测，在高清晰度电视竞赛中，美国一旦失败，到2010年美国将会失去2百万个工作岗位，贸易逆差每年将增加2250亿美元。
    日本担心，日本制式的高清晰度电视一旦占领美国市场，可能会激起美国人的贸易保护主义情绪，于是主动邀请美国电子公司参加生产日制式的高清晰度电视芯片的合作。
    美国全国拥有1600万台电视机。美国联邦电信委员会作出规定，美国将选择的高清晰度电视机的制式必须能够兼容现有的电视系统。西欧采取的逐步实现高清晰度电视化的做法本身是对日本的一种挑战。西欧为了争夺美国市场，一方面向美国联邦电信委员会这一决策机构进行游说和疏通活动，另一方面也邀请美国电子公司参加欧洲制式的高清晰度电视生产合作。
    在这场角逐中，美国似乎已甘拜下风，情愿为日本和西欧的高清晰度电视提供芯片。然而不少美国人士并不甘心失败，他们认为，美国电子计算机工业有很大的优势，美国仍有条件追赶上。据专家们认为，高清晰度电视将在1995年以后正式投放市场。美国是个很大的潜在市场，一旦被日本占领，欧日之间的矛盾势将进一步激化。
