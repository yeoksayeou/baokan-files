On the 27th, the price of home heating oil for delivery in January at the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by 7.23 cents per gallon, reaching 99.71 cents, the highest price in six years.

This price is 37 cents higher than the closing price on November 30 and 53.77 cents higher than the same period last year. It is reported that the retail price of heating oil in many regions of the United States has already far exceeded the $1 per gallon mark and continues to rise.

In addition to heating oil, the prices of other fuels in the United States are also rising. Cold weather has also led to increases in the prices of fruits and vegetables.

    美取暖油价达六年来最高点
    在二十七日纽约商品交易所，明年一月份交货的家庭取暖油价格每加仑上涨了七点二三美分，达到九十九点七一美分，为六年来的最高价格。
    这一价格比十一月三十日的收盘价上涨了三十七美分，比去年同期上涨了五十三点七七美分。据报道，美国许多地区取暖油的零售价格已大大超过每加仑一美元大关，并继续攀升。
    除取暖油外，美国其它燃料的价格也在上涨。气候寒冷还导致水果和蔬菜价格上升。
