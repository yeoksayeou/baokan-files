The Gezhouba Hydropower Plant, which is responsible for supplying electricity to Central China and Shanghai, has achieved a record of 200 days of safe production since all 21 of its units were put into operation.

The Gezhouba Hydropower Plant has a total installed capacity of 2.715 million kilowatts. During the flood season, its power generation accounts for one-third of the Central China power grid. Since the first unit was put into operation in 1980, the plant has consistently prioritized safety in production. They have designated the plant manager as the primary responsible person for safety production and have established and improved a four-tier safety network consisting of the plant headquarters, sub-plants, workshops, and teams.

    据新华社武汉12月11日电　（通讯员李聚民）担负向华中四省和上海地区输电任务的葛洲坝水力发电厂，到12月10日已创21台机组全部投产后安全生产200天纪录。
    葛洲坝水力发电厂装机总容量达271.5万千瓦，丰水季节的发电量占华中电网的1／3。自1980年第一台机组投产以来，这个电厂一直把安全生产作为首要任务来抓。他们以厂长为安全生产第一责任人，先后建立和完善了以厂总部为中心的厂、分厂、车间、班组4级安全网。
