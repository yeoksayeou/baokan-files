China began implementing domestic commodity price subsidies in 1953. At that time, it was only for cotton lint, and the subsidy amount was not large. Subsequently, the scope and amount of subsidies gradually increased. By 1978, the national fiscal subsidies for prices had reached 9.386 billion yuan.

Over the past decade, fiscal price subsidies and enterprise loss subsidies have shown a sharp increase. In 1985, the national fiscal subsidies for enterprise losses and prices amounted to 48.025 billion yuan. This year, it is estimated to surge to 93.117 billion yuan, nearly doubling in four years.

More worrying is that the rate of increase in subsidies is accelerating, and their proportion of fiscal revenue is growing. In 1986, national subsidies accounted for 25.7% of fiscal revenue, rising to 29.5% in 1988, and this year it is expected to reach 32.6%. In 1987, national fiscal revenue increased by 8.637 billion yuan compared to 1986, while fiscal subsidies increased by 8.728 billion yuan, consuming all the increased revenue and still falling short by nearly 1 billion yuan. The situation in some provinces and cities is even more severe. In 1987, Shandong Province's subsidy amount accounted for 47.5% of that year's fiscal expenditure; Beijing is expected to reach 59.3% this year.

Fiscal subsidies in China have permeated various aspects of social and economic life. Urban residents can enjoy fiscal subsidies from birth to death. The birth of an only child comes with a subsidy, schooling includes textbook subsidies, and people's clothing (cotton and products, leather shoes), food (grains, oil, and meat, eggs, vegetables), housing (rent, heating, water, and electricity), transportation (public bus and subway monthly passes), and daily necessities (coal, soap) as well as medical care, reading newspapers and books, bathing, and haircuts all receive subsidies. Even funeral arrangements can receive subsidies. Last year, Beijing residents received an average of 530 yuan in subsidies per person, and Tianjin residents received an average of 500 yuan.

Among the price subsidies, grain is a major component. In 1987, the national subsidy for grain was 27.6 billion yuan, and in 1988, it exceeded 30 billion yuan.

The national subsidy for residents' meat, eggs, and vegetables is also substantial. In 1987, the national subsidy was around 3 billion yuan, and last year it reached 5 billion yuan. If production subsidies and explicit subsidies for residents are included, last year's national subsidy for meat, eggs, and vegetables was over 10 billion yuan.

Fiscal subsidies, as an economic lever, should ideally act as a "lubricant." However, excessive subsidies inevitably crowd out normal construction investments, causing the national economy to lose momentum and adding new difficulties to future price adjustments. If fiscal subsidies continue to increase unchecked as in previous years, neither the central government nor local governments will be able to bear the burden.

### 我国财政补贴负担沉重

    我国财政补贴负担沉重
    我国实行国内商品价格补贴是从1953年开始的。当时仅有絮棉一项，补贴数额也不大。以后逐步加大了补贴范围和补贴数额。到1978年，全国用于价格的财政补贴达到93.86亿元。
    近10年来，财政价格补贴和企业亏损补贴出现了急剧增加的势头。1985年，全国财政用于企业亏损和价格的补贴为480.25亿元，到今年预计将猛增到931.17亿元，4年间就翻了近一番。
    更令人忧虑的是，补贴增加的速度越来越快，占财政收入的比重越来越大。1986年，全国补贴占财政收入的比重为25.7％，1988年增加到29.5％，今年将达到32.6％。1987年全国的财政收入比1986年增加86.37亿元，而同期的财政补贴却增加了87.28亿元，把当年财政增加的收入全部吃掉还差近1亿元。一些省市的情况更为严重。山东省1987年的补贴额占到当年财政支出的47.5％；北京市今年将达到59.3％。
    我国财政补贴已渗透到了社会经济生活的各个方面，城镇居民从生到死均可享受财政补贴的恩泽。独生子女问世便有补贴，上学有书本补贴，人们的衣（棉花及制品、猪皮鞋）、食（粮、油和肉、蛋、菜）、住（房租、取暖、水电）、行（公共电汽车及地铁月票）、用（燃煤、肥皂），以及医疗、看书看报、洗澡理发都有补贴，死后办理丧事也可得到补贴。去年，北京市居民人均享受补贴530元，天津市人均享受500元。
    在价格补贴中，粮食是个大头。1987年，全国对粮食的补贴为276亿元，1988年突破了300亿元的大关。
    国家对居民肉、蛋、菜的补贴数额也很惊人，1987年全国的补贴为30亿元上下，去年已达到50亿元。如果把对生产的补贴和对居民的明补计算在内，去年全国用于肉、蛋、菜的补贴已一百几十亿元。
    财政补贴作为一种经济杠杆，本来应该成为“润滑剂”，而现在的补贴却不是这样。补贴过多，势必挤占正常的建设投资，使国民经济失去后劲，也为今后理顺价格增加了新的难度。财政补贴如果仍照前几年的样子无休止地增加下去，不论是中央财政，还是地方财政都已无法承受了。
