**The Changing International Situation and Prospects – Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's Remarks**

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently spoke with the reporter from the *Outlook Weekly* about the profound changes in the international situation. He pointed out that the easing of military confrontation between the superpowers does not equate to stability in the international situation. Factors leading to instability have not been eliminated, and under certain conditions, some regions may experience turbulent situations. Recent dramatic changes in Eastern Europe have added new elements of instability to East-West relations. The following is a summary of Foreign Minister Qian's remarks:

He said that in the early 1980s, the escalation of the arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and the intensification of regional conflicts led to extreme tension in the international situation. However, after a long period of struggle, neither side was able to alter the fundamental military balance between them, and instead, both were burdened with heavy economic burdens. Several aggressive wars ended in failure, which made it clear that pursuing hegemony and power politics through military means was not viable.

He said that by the mid-1980s, the imbalance in global economic development and the rise of new technological revolutions led to significant changes in the balance of power among major countries. The trend towards a multipolar world became increasingly apparent, and the relative positions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union declined. It was under these circumstances that the U.S. and the Soviet Union resumed their summit meetings, which had been suspended for six years, and thereafter held almost annual meetings. They signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons, conventional weapons, and the prohibition of chemical weapons made progress. Due to the U.S.-Soviet dialogue, East-West relations eased, and conflicts in some regions cooled down, with a clear trend towards political solutions. Overall, it can be said that while the factors of war still exist, they have weakened, and the factors of peace have grown. There is a realistic possibility of achieving a relatively long period of peace.

He said, however, that the easing of military confrontation between the superpowers does not mean stability in the international situation. Factors leading to instability have not been eliminated, and under certain conditions, some regions may experience extreme turmoil. Phenomena such as hegemony, power politics, interference in internal affairs, and the imposition of one's will on others still frequently occur. Recent dramatic changes in Eastern Europe will have a profound impact on the European situation and the overall structure of international relations, adding new elements of instability to East-West relations and attracting the attention of all parties. At the same time, the economic gap between the North and the South continues to widen. Due to the irrational international economic order, capital flows to developed countries rather than developing countries, resulting in the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. This is very unfavorable for world peace and stability.

In discussing how to view the intense struggle between different social systems and ideologies in today's easing international situation, he said that some politicians in the capitalist world have never hidden their intention to bring socialist countries back into the capitalist orbit. In the mid-1980s, the international situation showed signs of easing, and exchanges between countries with different social systems increased, which was a good thing. However, due to difficulties encountered by socialist countries in their reform and development processes and mistakes in decision-making, the superiority of the socialist system was not fully demonstrated. As a result, a trend emerged internationally that socialism had suffered a "great failure" and that capitalism could achieve a "victory without war." Some people were overjoyed, believing this to be a "historic opportunity" to peacefully transform socialist countries. In fact, socialism has not failed, and capitalism cannot claim victory. The coexistence of countries with different social systems is an objective reality. Since coexistence is necessary, mutual exchanges are inevitable, and there must be common rules to follow. We believe these are the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Easing does not mean the absence of struggle, nor does it equate to stability. It seems that under the overall trend of easing, the struggle between different social systems and ideologies has become more complex and intense. If not handled properly, it will lead to regional turmoil and instability in the world situation, ultimately harming the people of all countries.

In discussing the prospects of U.S.-Soviet relations after the Malta summit, he said that Malta easily reminds one of Yalta. History does not repeat itself, and Malta is not Yalta. Yalta was where the victorious powers of World War II sketched the post-war international political blueprint, while Malta was where the U.S. and the Soviet Union, concerned about the rapid developments in Eastern Europe, needed to quickly understand each other's intentions to prevent the situation from getting out of control and damaging their strategic interests. After Malta, U.S.-Soviet relations will enter a phase where confrontation decreases and compromise and cooperation develop. Due to the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, the United States has taken a more proactive stance, while the Soviet Union is more in a passive, retreating position. However, as the two superpowers with the largest military forces, their long-term strategic goals are different, and the basic nature of U.S.-Soviet relations remains that of mutual rivalry.

In looking ahead to the political landscape of the 1990s, he said that it is still difficult to predict exactly how the political landscape of the 1990s will unfold. What can be seen is that the post-war bipolar system characterized by the Cold War between East and West, the confrontation of two blocs, and the struggle for hegemony between the two superpowers will face strong challenges. The trend towards a multipolar world will continue to develop, and new centers of power and regional cooperation organizations will emerge. In the global struggle for peace and development, multipolarity means the breakdown of the post-war bipolar system; for Western developed countries, it means intensified economic competition among the U.S., Europe, and Japan; and for the Third World, it means the development of regional cooperation organizations and the struggle of small and medium-sized countries for more say in international affairs.

In discussing the prospects for the development of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, he said that the characteristics and advantages of the Asia-Pacific region are its vastness, abundant resources, and especially its abundant human resources. To adapt to international competition, most Asia-Pacific countries continuously improve their investment environment, pay attention to improving the quality of the workforce, and formulate and implement economic and technological development strategies that suit their national conditions. They have achieved remarkable results in attracting foreign investment and advanced technology, developing labor-intensive industries, expanding processing industries, and increasing exports. Due to continuous economic development and fierce competition in the global market, countries in the Asia-Pacific region all have the need and desire to strengthen economic cooperation and trade exchanges within the region. Driven by the trend of economic regionalization and bloc formation, various proposals and ideas for Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation organizations have emerged.

He said that it is generally believed that the form of economic cooperation or organization in the Asia-Pacific region will be loose and will not form a unified organization like the European Community. We believe that any comprehensive political and economic organization in the Asia-Pacific region without China's participation would be incomplete. China's role in this region has been recognized by all countries.

He said that cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region still has a long way to go, but the prospects are good. For regional economic cooperation to truly make progress, maintaining peace and stability in the region is the top priority. Countries should strictly adhere to the principles of peaceful coexistence, develop economic relations with each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and exchange what they have and learn from each other. Regional cooperation organizations should be open and should not form exclusive blocs or promote trade protectionism.

In discussing how China's diplomatic work will strive to create a favorable international environment for deepening reforms and further opening up, he said that in the next two to three years, we need to focus on governance and rectification, further deepen reforms, and strive for sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. The primary task of diplomatic work is to create a stable, peaceful, and favorable international environment to safeguard China's national interests and security. Secondly, diplomatic work should create conditions for further opening up. A current issue is that Western countries imposed economic sanctions on China after June this year. Economic sanctions not only caused some damage to China but also harmed the countries imposing the sanctions. In recent months, more and more enlightened individuals and far-sighted businesspeople in the international community have recognized that attempts to exclude and isolate China are neither wise nor feasible. China's strategic position and enormous potential are objective realities that Western countries must seriously consider. China will not change its policy of opening up and close the doors that have already been opened. We hope that other countries will not close the doors to China. Thirdly, more efforts should be made to support the development of foreign economic and trade relations. Safeguarding China's legitimate rights in foreign economic relations, ensuring that these relations are based on equality and mutual benefit, and opposing all forms of discrimination and restrictions. We should restore and maintain China's rightful status in international economic organizations and open up channels for cooperation and exchange.

    国际形势的变化及前景
    ——钱其琛外长谈话摘要
    中国外长钱其琛最近接受《了望》周刊记者采访时，就深刻变化中的国际形势发表谈话指出，超级大国军事对抗的缓和并不等于国际形势的稳定。导致动荡的各种因素并未消除，在一定条件下，某些地区会出现动荡的局势。最近东欧发生剧变，为东西方关系增加了新的不稳定因素。现将钱外长的谈话摘发如下：
    他在谈到80年代国际形势发展的特点时说，80年代初，美苏军备竞赛升级，地区冲突加剧，曾导致国际形势的极度紧张。但双方经过长期的争夺，均未能改变彼此间军事上的大体均势，反而使它们各自背上了沉重的经济包袱。几场侵略战争都遭失败，这不能不使人认识到，只凭军事实力推行霸权主义和强权政治是行不通了。
    他说，到80年代中期，世界经济发展的不平衡和新技术革命的兴起，使世界上主要国家之间的力量对比发生了重大变化，世界多极化的趋势日益明显，美苏地位相对下降。就是在这种情况下，美苏于1985年恢复了中断达6年之久的美苏首脑会晤，之后几乎每年都举行会晤。美苏签署了全部销毁中程和中短程导弹条约，削减战略核武器、常规武器和禁止化学武器等方面的谈判也取得了进展。由于美苏对话，东西方关系趋于缓和，世界一些地区冲突先后降温，实现政治解决的势头明显增强。总的来看，可以说战争因素虽然继续存在，但已经减弱，和平因素在增长，争取一个较长的和平时期有了现实的可能。
    他说，但是，超级大国军事对抗的缓和并不等于国际形势的稳定。导致动荡的各种因素并未消除，在一定条件下，某些地区会出现极度动荡的局势。霸权主义、强权政治、干涉别国内政，把自己的意志强加于人的现象还在经常发生。最近东欧发生剧变，对欧洲局势和国际关系总格局将产生深远的影响，为东西方关系增加了新的不稳定因素，引起了各方的关注。同时，南北经济差距继续扩大，由于不合理的国际经济秩序，资金流向发达国家而不是发展中国家，造成富国越富、穷国越穷的现象，这对于世界的和平与稳定是非常不利的。
    他在谈到如何看待在国际形势趋向缓和的今天，不同社会制度和不同意识形态之间的斗争却十分激烈这一问题时说，资本主义世界的一些政治家从不讳言他们希望把社会主义国家重新纳入到资本主义轨道上来的意图。80年代中期，国际形势出现缓和趋势，不同社会制度国家间的交往增多，这本来是好事。由于社会主义国家在改革和发展过程中遇到困难、决策上有失误，社会主义制度优越性没有充分体现出来，于是，国际上兴起一股社会主义已经遭到“大失败”，资本主义可以“不战而胜”的思潮，有人兴高采烈地认为这是促使社会主义国家和平演变的“历史性机会”。事实上社会主义并未失败，资本主义也谈不到胜利，不同社会制度的国家并存共处还是客观现实。既然并存共处，就要相互交往，就要有共同遵守的关系准则，我们认为这就是和平共处五项原则。缓和不是没有斗争，也不等于稳定。看来在缓和的总趋势下，不同社会制度和不同意识形态之间的斗争变得更加复杂、激烈。如果处理得不好，会造成地区动乱和世界局势的不稳定，归根到底对各国人民是不利的。
    他在谈到马耳他美苏首脑会晤后的美苏关系前景时说，马耳他很容易使人联想起雅尔塔。历史不会重复，马耳他不是雅尔塔。雅尔塔是第二次世界大战中取得胜利的大国描绘战后的国际政治蓝图，马耳他是美苏对东欧局势发展过快很担心，需要立即摸清对方意图，防止形势出现失控，以至损害各自的战略利益。马耳他之后，美苏关系将进入一个对抗趋于减少，妥协与合作有所发展的阶段。由于东欧形势的剧变，美国更多采取主动进取姿态，而苏联更多地处于被动退却的境地。但是，作为拥有最大军事力量的两个超级大国，长远战略目标各异，美苏关系的基本态势仍然是互为对手。
    他在瞻望90年代世界政治格局的前景时说，对90年代政治格局的前景究竟如何，现在还难以作出预测。可以看到的是，战后形成的以东西方之间的冷战、两大集团的对峙和两个超级大国争夺霸权为特征的美苏两极体制，将受到强大的冲击。世界的多极化趋势将日益发展，会出现一些新的力量中心和地区合作组织。在世界人民争取和平和谋求发展的斗争中，多极化就全球而言，是战后两极格局的被打破；就西方发达国家而言，是美、欧、日之间的经济竞争更趋激烈；就第三世界而言，是地区性合作组织的发展和中小国家争取对国际事务有更多的发言权。
    他在展望亚太地区形势发展的前景时说，亚太地区的特点和优势是地区辽阔，资源丰富，特别是人力资源充足。为了适应国际竞争，大多数亚太国家不断改善投资环境，注意提高劳动力的素质，制定和实施切合本国实际的经济和科技发展战略。他们在引进外资和先进技术、发展劳动密集型产业、扩大加工工业和增加出口方面成绩斐然。由于经济的不断发展和世界市场的激烈竞争，亚太各国都有加强本地区经济合作和贸易往来的要求和愿望。伴之以世界经济区域化、集团化潮流的推动，关于亚太地区经济合作组织形式的种种建议和构想纷纷出台。
    他说，一般认为，亚太地区的经济合作形式或组织将是松散的，不可能形成欧洲共同体那样的一体化组织。我们认为，在亚太地区任何一个全区域性的政治经济组织中，如果没有中国参加将是不完整的。中国在这个地区的作用已得到各国的公认。
    他说，亚太地区的合作还有漫长的路要走，但前景良好。该地区的经济合作要能真正取得进展，保持本地区的和平与稳定是首要条件。各国之间要严格遵守和平共处原则，要在平等互利的基础上发展相互间的经济关系，互通有无，取长补短。地区合作组织应当是开放性的，不能搞排他性的集团和推行贸易保护主义。
    钱其琛外长谈到中国的外交工作如何为深化改革和进一步开放创造良好的国际环境而努力的问题时说，最近两三年中我们要搞好治理、整顿，进一步深化改革，以谋求国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。外交工作的首要任务就是要为此创造一个稳定的、和平的、有利的国际环境，以维护我国的民族利益和国家安全。其次，外交工作要为进一步开放创造条件。当前遇到的一个问题就是今年6月以后，西方国家对我国进行经济制裁。经济制裁不仅对中国造成一定的损害，进行制裁的国家本身也会受到损害。近几个月来国际上越来越多的有识之士和有远见的企业家已经认识到，企图排斥、孤立中国的做法是既不明智，也是根本不可能的。中国的战略地位和庞大的潜力是客观存在，是西方国家不得不认真对待的。中国不会改变开放政策，把已经打开的大门关上。希望其他国家也不要自己把通向中国的大门关闭起来。第三，要为对外经贸关系的发展多做配合工作。维护我国在对外经济关系中的正当权益，使这种关系建立在平等互利基础上，反对各种歧视和限制。要恢复和维护在国际经济组织中我国应有的合法地位，疏通合作和交流的渠道。
