	Deputy Governor Visits Disaster-Affected Families
	Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhái Jǐngyào

	“Hey, the governor is here!” The 66-year-old farmer Róng Dékuān from Wāzi Village, Liánfēng Township, Qīnggāng County was husking corn on the kang (a traditional Chinese heated bed) when he heard that one of the people entering his home was the governor. He was so happy that he didn’t know what to say.

	“This year, you’ve suffered a disaster. I’ve come to see how you’re doing and to discuss how we can handle this,” said Deputy Governor Chén Yúnlín of Heilongjiang Province, as he picked up a corn cob and started husking it.

	“Indeed! We’ve suffered a disaster, and our food supply is insufficient. Right now, I’m hoping my son can go out and earn some money, but he hasn’t found a job yet,” said the old man helplessly.

	“That’s right! We must find ways to resist the disaster and help ourselves.” Since mid-month, Chén Yúnlín spent a week traveling over 1000 kilometers in wind and snow, along with colleagues from departments such as poverty alleviation, finance, and banking. He visited six severely drought-affected cities and counties and more than a dozen households.

	In a disaster-affected family in Míngshuǐ County, Chén Yúnlín saw two horses tied in the stable. “Wow, with horses, you can do transportation!” he said. “Yes!” the county party secretary added, “We are creating conditions for disaster-affected people to do transportation and trade.” “That’s great. In disaster areas, we should encourage this. Although the state will provide some relief, more depends on yourselves.”

	Less than five days after Chén Yúnlín’s visit, Míngshuǐ County organized more than 3000 people to go to the Greater Khingan Range and Daqing for labor export. More than 120 cadres continued to go down to the countryside, taking responsibility for counties and villages. The entire county also launched a campaign to collect manure.

	Other cities and counties in the disaster area also took similar measures. Now, disaster relief and self-help activities are proceeding in an orderly manner.

    副省长来到灾民家
    新华社记者　翟景耀
    “哎，省长来了！”青冈县连丰乡洼子里村66岁的老汉房得宽正在炕上搓玉米，听说家里进来的几个人中有一位是省长，高兴得不知说啥好。
    “今年遭灾了，我来看一看，咱们商量商量看怎么办好？”黑龙江省副省长陈云林一边说，一边随手拿起一只玉米棒子搓了起来。
    “可不是么！遭了灾，口粮都不够吃。眼下，我指望儿子出去赚几个钱，可还没找到活儿干”。房老汉无可奈何地说。
    “对！要想方设法抗灾自救”。本月中旬以来，陈云林用一周的时间，顶风冒雪，行程1000多公里，同扶贫、财政、金融等部门的同志一道，走访了6个受旱灾较重的市、县，十几家农户。
    在明水县一户灾民家里，陈云林看到马棚里拴着两匹马，“嗬，有了马就可以跑运输了。”“是呀！”县委书记接着说：“我们正为灾民跑运输、搞贩运创造条件。”“这很好，在灾区应该提倡，国家虽然会救济一些，更多的还要靠你们自己。”
    在陈云林走后不到5天，明水县就组织了3000多人到大兴安岭、大庆等地搞劳务输出，120多名干部继续下乡，包乡、包村，全县还掀起了拣粪肥的高潮。
    灾区其他市、县也采取了类似措施，如今，抗灾自救活动有条不紊地展开了。
