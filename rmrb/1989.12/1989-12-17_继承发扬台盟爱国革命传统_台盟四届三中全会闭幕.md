The fourth plenary session of the fourth national committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League concluded in Beijing today.

The public report of the fourth plenary session of the fourth national committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, adopted at today's closing ceremony, pointed out that under the current situation, the tasks of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League will be even more arduous. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party in a system of multi-party cooperation can the political functions of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League be correctly and fully exerted. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League should carry out in-depth education among its members to uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, carry forward and develop the patriotic revolutionary tradition of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; establish the concept of acting in accordance with the national conditions; advocate the spirit of dedication; and further improve the political quality and ability to participate in politics and policy-making of its members.

The public report believes that the future of Taiwan lies on the mainland, and the mainland is the place where Taiwan compatriots can fully display their talents. The public report criticizes the "three nos" policy of the Taiwan authorities, which aims at maintaining the status quo and rejecting peace, and the policy of attempting to infiltrate the mainland politically. It points out that this policy goes against the fundamental interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and seriously harms the immediate and long-term interests of the people of Taiwan. It also fuels the spread of "Taiwan independence" forces on the island. This will inevitably intensify various contradictions within Taiwan, trigger greater political conflicts, and is undoubtedly a great misfortune for the people of Taiwan.

At today's closing ceremony, the attendees adopted the work report of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League for 1989, the work plan for 1990, and the resolution of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League on strengthening ideological and organizational construction.

At today's meeting, Cai Zimin, chairman of the standing committee of the central committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, delivered the closing speech. Lin Shengzhong, a member of the standing committee, presided over the closing ceremony. Song Kun, deputy director of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the closing ceremony and delivered a speech.

    继承发扬台盟爱国革命传统
    台盟四届三中全会闭幕
    新华社北京12月16日电　台湾民主自治同盟四届三中全会今天在北京闭幕。
    在今天闭幕式上通过的台盟中央四届三中全会公报中指出，在当前的形势下，台盟今后的任务将更加繁重，只有在共产党领导的多党合作制中，台盟的政党职能才能得到正确、充分的发挥，台盟应在盟员中深入开展坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，继承和发扬台盟的爱国革命传统；树立一切从国情出发的观念；提倡奉献精神；进一步提高盟员的政治素质和参政议政能力。
    公报认为，台湾的前途在大陆，祖国大陆才是台湾同胞大显身手的好地方。公报批评台湾当局“偏安拒和”的“三不”政策和企图对大陆进行政治渗透的政策，指出这种政策违背两岸人民的根本利益，对台湾人民的现实利益和长远利益都是严重的伤害，并且助长了“台独”势力在岛内的蔓延。这必将加剧台湾岛内各种矛盾的激化，引发更大的政治冲突，对台湾人民来说，这无疑是一大不幸。
    在今天的闭幕式上，与会者通过了台盟1989年工作报告，1990年工作设想和台盟关于加强思想建设、组织建设的决议。
    今天的会上，台盟中央主席团主席蔡子民致闭幕词，主席团成员林盛中主持了闭幕式。中共中央统战部副部长宋堃出席了闭幕式并讲了话。
