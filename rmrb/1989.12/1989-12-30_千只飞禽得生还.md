	Huoqiao County in Anhui Province has two lakes, Donghu and Xihu, to the east and west of the city, respectively, covering nearly 300,000 mu of water surface. These lakes are natural habitats for birds. With the restoration of Xihu Lake, the ecological environment has been further improved, leading to a significant increase in the number of birds in the area.

	On the evening of November 8, Comrade Tian Ping, the leader of the county's night patrol team, received a report that someone was poaching birds in Donghu Lake. He immediately assembled the team members and set out in the rain that night. By the time the patrol team reached Dashangang, over 30 miles from the city, the poachers had already loaded the captured birds onto a truck bound for Wuhan and were heading towards Huoqiao County.

	Despite the hunger and cold, Tian Ping and his team pursued the poachers on a tricycle. After more than an hour of relentless pursuit, they finally caught up with the truck, which had slowed down as it passed through the city. Upon inspection, they found 36 baskets containing over 1,000 birds, including national second-class protected species such as wild ducks and swans. Through interrogation, it was revealed that these birds had been captured using nets. Tian Ping and his team criticized the poachers, explaining the importance of protecting wildlife, and fined them 800 yuan according to relevant regulations, confiscating all the captured birds.

	To release these birds back into the wild, the patrol team, despite their fatigue, transported them to Shuimen Tang in Chenjiapu Township. This ensured the survival of the thousand birds, allowing them to soar freely in the blue sky once again.

    千只飞禽得生还
    李忠诚
    安徽省霍邵县的城东、城西两湖有近30万亩水面，是天然的禽鸟养殖场。随着城西湖围垦还湖，生态环境得到进一步改善，湖面上各种飞禽剧增。
    11月8日晚，县夜间巡逻组组长田平同志获悉有人在城东湖偷捕飞禽，立即召集小组成员连夜冒雨出发。等夜巡组的同志赶到距城30多里地的大店岗时，偷猎者已将捕到的野禽装上开往武汉的车上，正向霍邵县城方向驶去。田平等不顾饥饿、夜寒，坐上三轮车急追起汽车来。
    经过一个多小时的苦追，终于赶上了因途经城关而减速的大客车。一检查，车顶篷上装着36筐1000多只国家二类保护动物野鸭、鸿雁等。通过盘问，这1000多只飞禽是用围网张捕的。田平等对他们进行批评教育，讲明保护野生动物的意义，并根据有关法规处以800元罚金，没收全部猎物。
    为了把这些险遭宰杀的野鸭、鸿雁放回大自然中去，夜巡组同志又不顾疲劳把它们运到陈家埠乡水门塘，使这千只野禽得以生还，重新展翅竞飞在蓝天下。
