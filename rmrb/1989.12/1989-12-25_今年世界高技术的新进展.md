A new technological revolution centered around high technology is flourishing around the world. This year, many countries have increased their focus and support for high technology, either through international cooperation or by forming corporate groups, further advancing research in basic research, new discoveries, new inventions, and many other areas. This has pushed global high technology to new heights.

**Particle Engineering Technology**

On November 13, the world's largest particle accelerator, the European "LEP" (Large Electron-Positron Collider), was officially completed. It can simulate the conditions of the universe's big bang billions of years ago, with a maximum energy of over 1000 billion electron volts, capable of producing large quantities of "Z" particles. By studying the mass, lifespan, and decay characteristics of these particles, scientists can gain fundamental insights into the laws of nature and the basic rules of the universe's motion, leading to numerous new discoveries. Japan's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research has built a large heavy-ion cyclotron, currently the world's leading accelerator, capable of accelerating protons to an energy of 1.35 billion electron volts and nitrogen ions to a speed of 14,700 kilometers per second, nearly half the speed of light. The Argonne National Laboratory in the United States demonstrated a new wakefield particle acceleration technology, which can significantly reduce the length and cost of accelerators and may also be used to create particle beam weapons.

With the advancement of particle engineering technology, in October, research teams from Stanford University in the United States and a European research group announced, just one day apart, that based on measurements of the "Z" zero particle mass, they have determined that there are only three basic families of particles, and that the fundamental types of matter in the universe will not exceed three. This discovery is considered a significant milestone in the fields of physics, astronomy, and cosmology.

**Nuclear Fusion Research Heats Up**

This year, developments in nuclear energy technology have been particularly notable. In the field of controlled thermonuclear fusion, early this year, the "Tokamak-15" began operation under the leadership of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, USSR. This is currently the world's most advanced thermonuclear fusion experimental device. Its reactions produce a high-temperature plasma of pure hydrogen at approximately 100 million degrees, with an energy output per unit weight of fuel that is 10 million times greater than conventional organic fuels. In July, the Nuclear Fusion Research Center at Osaka University in Japan successfully achieved a plasma density four times that of the sun's core. If the current power is increased by a factor of ten, laser nuclear fusion could be achieved.

The research on room-temperature nuclear fusion has caused a worldwide sensation this year. In March, American scientist Pons and British scientist Fleischmann announced that they had achieved room-temperature nuclear fusion using a simple experiment involving two electrodes in water. Subsequently, thousands of scientists from hundreds of experimental institutions around the world joined this race to replicate the experiment, with approximately 60 research institutions from 15 countries and regions announcing that they had replicated or partially replicated the results of the two scientists. A global wave of room-temperature nuclear fusion research has been ignited. However, scientists have differing opinions on these experimental results, with some affirming and others doubting, leading to significant fluctuations. Currently, there are new developments.

**High-Definition Television**

Early this year, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation and others successfully developed high-definition television, which is expected to hit the market next year. Research and development in Western Europe and the United States have also reached the stage of practical application. High-definition television is a product of contemporary microelectronics, large-scale integrated circuit technology, device technology, and micro-fabrication technology, integrating various technological achievements in filming, display, transmission, and recording. It is considered a typical example of "accumulated" scientific research results and has become a focal point of global high-tech competition this year.

**Electronic Computers**

In the field of electronic computers, Japan, having completed the prototype of the fifth-generation computer last year, has entered the final three years of development this year, aiming to achieve parallel processing of 1,000 inference machines and a processing speed of one to ten billion inferences per second. In April, Hitachi's "SX-3" supercomputer achieved a computational speed of 220 billion operations per second, marking a breakthrough in computational speed. In June, the Encore Corporation in the United States increased the computational speed to 270 billion operations per second. In the development of new types of computers, countries such as Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom have strengthened their research on optoelectronic computers, neural network computers, and "fuzzy" computers, showing a trend towards integrating optoelectronics with neural networks and fuzzy theory with neural network theory. By the end of July, Mitsubishi Electric Company announced the successful development of the world's first optoelectronic neural computer, which uses optical elements and digital learning algorithms for signal processing and can already recognize 26 alphabetic symbols.

**Superconductivity and Its Applications**

This year, superconductivity research has made steady progress. In July, the Basic Research Laboratory of Hitachi, Ltd. in Japan successfully observed the microscopic magnetic field of a superconductor using electron holography and captured stereoscopic images of the magnetic field, opening new avenues for understanding the mysteries of superconducting magnetic fields and exploring the structural characteristics of zero-resistance superconductors.

The application of superconductivity technology is becoming increasingly widespread. The detectors of the European "LEP" electron-positron collider are the world's largest superconducting magnets. The magnetic confinement system of the Soviet "Tokamak-15" thermonuclear fusion experimental device also uses the most promising low-temperature superconductor, niobium-tin compound. In August, Hitachi Manufacturing Corporation completed basic experiments on superconducting quantum devices using superconductivity technology, which can increase the integration of circuits by 100 times and the speed by 10 times.

**DNA Photography, AIDS, and Cancer Treatment**

In November, the University of New Mexico in the United States used a scanning tunneling electron microscope to photograph the atomic arrangement of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from E. coli. This technology allows scientists to directly observe the structure of individual gene atoms and aids in deciphering the sequence of 3 billion bits of information in the human genome project, one of the largest scientific endeavors in modern science.

Regarding the prevention and treatment of AIDS, in June, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California, initially developed a vaccine to prevent AIDS. Tests on chimpanzees showed that the vaccine not only prevents AIDS virus infection but also inhibits the progression of the disease in chimpanzees already infected with the AIDS virus. In November, the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science in Japan discovered a monoclonal antibody against AIDS. In the treatment of cancer, the National Cancer Institute in the United States achieved a world first by transplanting exogenous genes into the human body. Through intravenous injection, genetically modified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (white blood cells that seek and destroy cancer cells) were administered to patients, marking the first step towards true gene therapy for humans.

**Optical Fiber Amplifiers and New Spaceplanes**

Optical fiber communication, with its large capacity, high quality, and resistance to weather interference, is gradually becoming the mainstream of global communication technology. In November, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation in Japan successfully developed an optical fiber amplifier by doping a small amount of the rare earth element erbium into silica fiber, achieving a world-first optical fiber communication distance of 900 kilometers. The test results showed that even if the transmission distance is extended by 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers, good communication effects can still be obtained.

Led by the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in collaboration with several major aircraft manufacturers from the United Kingdom and other countries, the "National Aerospace Plane" project has made significant progress this year. They have designed a "supersonic combustion ramjet engine" that can capture oxygen in the thin air of the upper atmosphere, allowing the spaceplane to accelerate to 25 times the speed of sound in an instant. Another technological breakthrough is the successful use of lightweight titanium alloys for the outer layer of the spaceplane, which can withstand the high temperatures generated during frequent atmospheric re-entry. This new type of spaceplane is only half the size of the current space shuttle, weighs only one-tenth of the shuttle's launch weight, but has a payload capacity equal to half of the shuttle's, and can take off and land on existing runways without the need for rocket launches.

    今年世界高技术的新进展
    柯荆卿
    一场以高技术为中心的新的科技革命，正在世界各地蓬勃兴起。今年，许多国家加强了对高技术的重视与支持，或通过国际合作，或组成企业集团，进一步开发研究，在基础研究、新发现、新发明等许多方面，均有较大进展，把世界高技术推向了一个新的高度。
    粒子工程技术
    11月13日，世界上最大的粒子加速器——欧洲“莱泼”正负电子对撞机正式建成。它能模拟数亿年前宇宙大爆炸的情景，最大能量可达到1000多亿电子伏，能大量生产“Z”粒子。通过对该粒子的质量、寿命、衰变等特性的研究，可获得关于自然力的基本线索，进一步了解宇宙运动的基本规律，并将会有大量新发现。日本理化学研究所建成当前居世界领先地位的大型重离子回旋加速器，能将质子加速到1.35亿电子伏的能量，氮离子速度可达到14700公里／秒，接近光速的一半。美国阿贡实验室演示出一种新的尾波场粒子加速技术，可大大减少加速器的长度和成本，还可能用于制造粒子束武器。
    随着粒子工程技术的进展，10月，美国斯坦福研究小组和欧洲研究组相差一天先后宣布，在测定
  “Z”零粒子质量的基础上判明，3个基本粒子家族是物质仅有的3个基本种类，宇宙间物质的基本种类不会超过3类。这一发现被认为是对物理学、天文学和宇宙学研究具有深远意义的一个科学里程碑。
    核聚变研究热
    今年核能技术的发展更加引人注目。在可控热核聚变的研究方面，今年初，苏联莫斯科库尔恰托夫原子能研究所主持兴建的“托卡马克—15”开始运行。这是目前世界上最先进的热核聚变实验装置。其反应产生了约1亿度高温纯氢等离子体，所生能量按单位重量燃料计算是普通有机燃料的1000万倍。7月，日本大阪大学核聚变研究中心成功地获得相当于太阳中心密度4倍的等离子体，如果现用功率再增加10倍，即可实现激光核聚变。
    室温核聚变的研究今年引起全世界轰动。3月，美国科学家庞斯和英国科学家弗莱希曼宣布，在常温下利用简单的在水中使两电极通电的实验，实现了室温核聚变。之后，全世界有数百个实验机构的上千名科学家投入了这场室温核聚变实验竞赛，并先后有15个国家和地区的约60个研究机构宣布重现和部分重现了上述两位科学家的实验结果。一场室温核聚变研究热在世界范围内掀起。但是，科学家们对这些实验结果认识不一，有肯定的，也有怀疑的，使这一实验产生很大波折，目前又有新的转机。
    高清晰度电视
    今年初，日本广播协会等试制成高清晰度电视，明年即可投放市场。西欧、美国的研制工作也达到实用化阶段。高清晰度电视是在当代微电子技术、大规模集成电路技术、器件技术、微细加工技术的支持下，在摄像、显示、传输、记录4个环节广泛吸收当代有关技术成果的基础上研制而成的，被认为是“积累型”科研成果的典型，成为今年世界高技术竞争的焦点。
    电子计算机
    在电子计算机领域，日本在去年完成第5代样机的基础上，今年进入最后3年的研制阶段，其目标是实现1000台推论机的并列和达到每秒1亿至10亿次的推论速度。4月，日本电器公司研制成功的“SX—3”超级计算机，运算速度达每秒220亿次，是当前运算速度方面的一个突破，6月，美国恩库比公司已把运算速度提高到每秒270亿次。在新型计算机的研制方面，今年日、美、英等国均加强了光电子计算机、神经网络式电子计算机、“模糊”计算机的研制，并呈现出光电子与神经网络、“模糊”理论与神经网络理论融合的新技术研制动向。7月底，日本三菱公司宣布试制成功世界上第一台光神经计算机，它采用光学元件和光信号处理用的数字学习算法，已能识别26个字母符号。
    超导及其应用
    今年，超导研究稳步前进。7月，日本日立公司基础科学研究所首次运用电子显微全息摄影技术，成功地观察到超导体的微小磁场，并拍摄出有关磁场的立体图像，为揭示超导体磁场奥秘、探索零电阻超导体结构特点开辟了新途径。
    超导技术的应用领域愈加广泛。欧洲“莱泼”正负电子对撞机的探测器是当今世界最大的超导磁体。苏联“托卡马克—15”热核聚变实验装置的磁约束系统也是使用的被认为最有前途的低温超导体铌锡化合物。8月，日本日立制作所利用超导技术完成超导量子器件基础实验，可使集成电路提高100倍，速度提高10倍。
    脱氧核糖核酸照片、艾滋病、癌症防治
    11月，美国新墨西哥大学用扫描隧道电子显微镜拍摄了从大肠杆菌分离出来的脱氧核糖核酸原子排列的照片。这种技术可使科学家直接看清单个基因原子的结构，并有助于查明现代科学最大规模项目之一的“人体基因结构30亿位信息的序列”。
    关于艾滋病的防治，6月，美国圣地亚哥索尔克生物学研究所初步研制成功预防艾滋病疫苗。经在黑猩猩身上试验，初步查明该疫苗不仅能预防艾滋病病毒感染，而且还能阻止已感染艾滋病病毒的黑猩猩的病情发展。11月，日本东京都临床医学综合研究所发现抗艾滋病的单克隆抗体。在治疗癌症方面，美国全国癌症研究所在世界上首次实现将外源基因移植入人体，通过静脉注射方式把改变了遗传性状的肿瘤侵润淋巴细胞（寻歼癌细胞的白血球）输给患者，标志着人类向真正的基因治疗迈出了第一步。
    光纤放大器、新型太空飞机
    光纤通信容量大，质量高，不受气候影响，正逐渐成为世界通信技术的主流。11月，日本国际电信电话公司在石英制光纤中掺入微量稀土元素铒，成功地研制出光纤放大器，在世界上最先实现光纤通信距离长达900公里的试验。试验结果表明，使用此种光纤放大器，即使传输距离再延长2000至3000公里，也能获得良好的通信效果。
    由美国国防部和国家宇宙航行局牵头，会同英国等国的几家主要飞机制造公司，联合研制新型太空飞机的“国家航天航空飞机”的计划，今年取得重大进展，现已设计出能在高层空间的稀薄空气中摄氧的“超音速冲压式喷气发动机”，可使太空飞机在瞬间加速到音速的25倍。另一项技术突破是成功地把轻质钛合金用作太空飞机的外层，可承受频繁穿越大气层时产生的高温。此种新型太空飞机体型只有目前航天飞机的一半大小，重量只有航天飞机发射时的1／10，而净载重量可达航天飞机的一半，起降时不用火箭发射，可在目前地球上普通机场的跑道上起飞和降落。
