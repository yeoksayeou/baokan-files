Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 16th

On December 13th, at noon, Burenbayar, a Mongolian student from the Class of 1989 in the Medical Department of Beijing Medical University, received a reply letter from General Secretary Jiang Zemin. This letter has sparked a strong response among the students at Beijing Medical University, with many saying that General Secretary Jiang's reply reflects the Party Central Committee's concern for the younger generation and points out the direction for us.

In his letter, General Secretary Jiang wrote, "In your letter, you mentioned that you believe the body of our Party is pure, and the mainstream is good. From your letter, I also saw that the hearts of our young generation are pure, and the mainstream is good. Among the youth, there is a large number of people who love the Communist Party, love socialism, and are determined to dedicate themselves to the cause of communism. They represent the mainstream of contemporary youth. These two mainstream forces combined, our cause has great hope."

General Secretary Jiang also expressed his gratitude to Burenbayar for his concern and love for the Party, praising his suggestions as excellent. In his letter, General Secretary Jiang wrote: "The struggle you have chosen—the cause of communism—is a great and magnificent, yet arduous and difficult, endeavor for humanity. Although it surges forward like a mighty wave, it will inevitably encounter twists, countercurrents, and rapids. Those who apply to join the Party are not always praised and envied by others; sometimes they may face cold shoulders and rejection. Before liberation, they might even risk their lives. When Marx was writing 'Capital,' he used the great Florentine poet's motto, 'Go your way, and let people talk!' as his guiding principle. This motto still has relevance today. I believe that only those who can steadfastly adhere to their beliefs, not only in favorable times but also in adversity, are true communists."

Recently, Burenbayar wrote a letter to General Secretary Jiang Zemin, expressing his views on the Chinese Communist Party and his wish to join the Party, as well as the difficulties and feelings he encountered during his application process.

This afternoon, the reporter met Burenbayar, who had just finished class. This sincere Mongolian college student happily said, "I never expected that the General Secretary of the Party would take the time to write a reply to an ordinary college student like me. This letter is very heavy, which shows that the Party Central Committee still has high hopes for us college students and hopes that we will one day shoulder the responsibility of building a socialist motherland." Burenbayar also told us that currently, more than 300 students in the school have written applications to join the Party, and there are more than 70 Party study groups.

Wang Chimin, the director of the school's Party Committee Office, said that after obtaining Burenbayar's consent, the school recently broadcasted General Secretary Jiang's reply letter to the entire school. The students responded enthusiastically. Many students said that Burenbayar's letter not only represents himself but also represents the voices of a group of college students. General Secretary Jiang's reply reflects the Party and government's concern and sincere communication with college students. The Party should look at the mainstream; otherwise, it will deviate from the direction, especially now. We believe that the Party will successfully build socialism, and we young students will also strive for communism to the end.

    江泽民总书记给北医大一学生回信说
    热爱党和社会主义是当代青年主流
    学生们反响热烈认为回信体现了党对他们的关怀
    新华社北京12月16日电　（记者张宝瑞、江钱峰）12月13日中午，北京医科大学医疗系八九级蒙古族学生布仁巴雅尔接到了江泽民总书记给他的回信。这封信在北医大引起热烈反响，许多学生说，江总书记的回信体现了党中央对青年一代的关心，给我们指明了方向。
    江总书记在信中说，你的来信中说，相信我们党的肌体是纯洁的，主流是好的。从你的来信中，我同样看到了，我们的年青一代的心是纯洁的，主流是好的。青年中有一大批热爱共产党、热爱社会主义，决心为共产主义事业而献身的人，他们代表了当代青年的主流。这两股主流结合在一起，我们的事业就大有希望。
    江总书记在回信中感谢布仁巴雅尔对党的关心和爱护，称赞他提的建议很好。江总书记在信中写道：“你所选定的奋斗目标——共产主义事业是人类空前伟大而壮丽的、又是空前艰苦而困难的事业，尽管它汹涌澎湃、滚滚向前，但必然也有曲折、逆流和险滩。申请入党的人不总是为人们所赞扬和羡慕的，有时也会受到冷眼和排挤；在解放前，甚至会冒着生命的危险。马克思在创作《资本论》的时候，曾经用伟大的佛罗伦萨诗人的格言‘走你的路，让人们去说罢！’作为座右铭。这句格言在今天仍然有现实意义。我相信，只有那些不仅在顺风之时，而且在逆流之中都能始终如一地坚持自己的信念的人，才是真正的共产主义战士。”
    布仁巴雅尔前不久给江泽民总书记写了一封信，反映了他对中国共产党的看法以及要求入党的愿望，同时诉说了他在申请入党的过程中遇到的困难和心情。
    今天中午，记者在北医大见到了刚刚下课的布仁巴雅尔。这位淳厚的蒙古族大学生高兴地说：“没想到党的总书记能在百忙之中给我这样一个普通大学生写回信。掂掂这封信，份量很重，这说明党中央对我们大学生仍然寄予厚望，希望我们将来能挑起建设社会主义祖国的重担。”布仁巴雅尔还告诉我们，现在全校已有300多个同学写了入党申请书，有70多个党课学习小组。
    学校党委办公室主任王赤民说，在征得布仁巴雅尔同学的同意后，学校近日在全校广播了江总书记给他的回信，学生们反响热烈。许多学生说，布仁巴雅尔的信不仅代表了他自己，也代表了一批大学生的心声。江总书记的回信体现了党和政府对大学生的关怀和真心的交流，对党应该看主流，否则就会偏离方向，特别是现在。我们相信党会把社会主义建设成功，我们青年学生也要为共产主义奋斗到底。（附图片）
