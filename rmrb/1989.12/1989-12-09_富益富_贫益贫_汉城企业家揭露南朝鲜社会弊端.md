The Rich Get Richer, the Poor Get Poorer: A Seoul Businessman Exposes South Korea's Social Ills

	New China News Agency, Pyongyang, December 7 - (Reporter Zhang Jinfang) Recently, a South Korean businessman, Jin Gwi-jin, who defected to North Korea, held a press conference in Pyongyang today. He exposed the political corruption and the widening gap between the rich and the poor in South Korean capitalist society through his personal experiences.

	At the press conference, Jin Gwi-jin said that he increasingly felt that South Korean society is in a state of "the rich get richer, the poor get poorer." Those living in luxury, the chaebols, and the authorities are closely tied together, controlling the South Korean economy. The poor cannot afford education or medical care.

	Jin Gwi-jin, who once held political office in South Korea, said that South Korean society is politically corrupt, and people are full of complaints. Running for a seat in the National Assembly in South Korea requires a large amount of money. To recoup the money spent during the election, these individuals, once elected, resort to all sorts of illegal and unethical means to enrich themselves. Under this social system, the people are politically powerless.

	He said that after coming to North Korea, he felt that the socialist system here is a society centered on the people. There is no gap between the rich and the poor, and people live and work in peace. This is in stark contrast to the current situation in South Korea.

### 富益富  贫益贫  汉城企业家揭露南朝鲜社会弊端

    汉城企业家揭露南朝鲜社会弊端
    新华社平壤12月7日电　（记者张锦芳）不久前投奔朝鲜北方的南朝鲜企业家丁奎珍今天在平壤举行记者招待会，以自己的亲身经历揭露南朝鲜资本主义社会政治腐败和贫富悬殊等现状。
    丁奎珍在记者招待会上说，他在南朝鲜日益感到那里的社会生活处于“富益富、贫益贫”的不平等状态。过着豪华生活的人、财阀和当局紧密勾结，控制着南朝鲜经济。而贫穷的人无法就学，有病无法就医。
    在南朝鲜曾经有过从政经历的丁奎珍说，南朝鲜社会政治上十分腐败，人们怨声载道。在南朝鲜竞选国会议员要花费大量金钱。为了将竞选时花掉的钱捞回来，这些人当选后，便不择手段地贪赃枉法，营私舞弊。在这种社会制度下，人民处于政治上无权利状态。
    他在谈到来到朝鲜北方后的感受时说，北方的社会主义制度是以民众为中心的社会制度。北方没有贫富悬殊现象，人们安居乐业。这同南朝鲜社会现状形成了鲜明的对照。
