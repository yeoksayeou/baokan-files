The U.S. Secretary of State Baker announced on the 20th that the Bush administration has decided to demolish and rebuild the newly constructed U.S. Embassy building in the Soviet Union. U.S. intelligence agencies believe that the Soviet Union installed eavesdropping devices during the construction of the building.

Baker said that U.S. intelligence agencies discovered as early as 1979 that the Soviet Union had placed listening devices in the concrete prefabricated components of the building. Since then, the U.S. side has been considering how to deal with this $500 million building.

Baker also said that the new embassy building will be constructed under extremely strict security measures.

    美决定将驻苏使馆大楼拆除重建
    美国国务卿贝克二十日表示，布什政府已决定将新建的美国驻苏联使馆大楼拆除重建。美国情报部门认为苏联在承建大楼时安装了窃听装置。
    贝克说，美国情报部门早在一九七九年就发现苏联在大楼的水泥预制件中安放了窃听器。自那以后，美国方面就一直在考虑如何处理这幢造价为五亿美元的大楼。
    贝克还说，新的使馆大楼将在极为严密的安全措施下修建。
