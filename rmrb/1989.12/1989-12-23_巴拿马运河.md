On December 20, the U.S. military suddenly invaded Panama, forcing the Panama Canal to close. This was the first time in 75 years that the Panama Canal had been closed.

The Panama Canal is located in the central part of the Republic of Panama and is an important waterway connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. It is 81.3 kilometers long and 152-304 meters wide. As early as 1826, there were proposals to build the Panama Canal. In 1879, an international conference was held in Paris to review the canal issue, and it was formally decided that the French government would build the Panama Canal. In 1903, the United States, through the unequal "Treaty of the United States and Panama," obtained the rights to build, permanently use, occupy, and control the Panama Canal and the canal zone. In 1904, the United States purchased the construction rights from the French and continued the construction of the canal, which the French had started in 1880. The canal was completed in 1914 and opened to navigation in 1915. The Panama Canal is one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. It is a lock canal, with a water level 26 meters higher than the two oceans, and has six locks, capable of accommodating ships of 40,000 to 50,000 tons. When ships pass through, they must go through three levels of locks to gradually raise the water level and lift the ship's hull to pass through; when they reach the other end, they must go through three levels of locks to gradually lower the ship to sea level. This magnificent spectacle is unique to the Panama Canal. The Pacific entrance of the canal is adjacent to the capital city of Panama, and the Atlantic entrance is located in the second-largest city of Panama, Colón. Over the past 75 years, approximately 700,000 ships from around the world have passed through this canal between the Pacific and the Atlantic.

After the signing of the new Panama Canal Treaty, the Panama Canal brings in $76 million to $81 million annually for Panama, while the United States makes a huge profit of $280 million to $320 million annually from the canal. The Panama Canal shortens the U.S. voyage from the East Coast to the West Coast by more than 10,000 kilometers, which is of great strategic significance for U.S. military control over the two oceans and strengthening Western Hemisphere defense. In 1963, the U.S. military established the Southern Command within a 16.1-kilometer range on both sides of the canal, built 14 military bases, stationed more than 10,000 troops, and appointed a governor, creating a "state within a state" on Panamanian territory.

To regain sovereignty over the canal, the Panamanian people have waged a long and unyielding struggle. In September 1977, they signed a new canal treaty with the United States, stipulating that the United States would hand over full sovereignty of the canal by December 31, 1999, and withdraw all its troops. To maintain control over the canal and its military presence after the year 2000, the United States has, over the past year and a half, exploited internal contradictions in Panama, exerted diplomatic pressure, imposed economic sanctions, and made military threats, causing serious damage to Panama's economy.

    巴拿马运河
    12月20日，美军突然入侵巴拿马，巴拿马运河被迫关闭。这是75年来巴拿马运河第一次关闭。
    巴拿马运河位于巴拿马共和国的中部，是沟通太平洋和大西洋的重要航运水道，全长81.3公里，宽152—304米。早在1826年，就曾有人提出开凿巴拿马运河的设想。1879年在巴黎召开审查运河问题的国际代表会上，正式决定由法国政府开凿巴拿马运河。1903年，美国通过不平等的《美巴条约》，取得了修建和永久使用、占领并控制巴拿马运河和运河区的权利。1904年，美国从法国人手里购买了运河的修筑权，继续修建这条法国人于1880年开始动工的运河。1914年竣工，1915年通航。巴拿马运河是本世纪最伟大的工程之一。它是船闸式运河，水位高出两大洋26米，有船闸6座，可通行4万至5万吨的海轮。船只通过时，需经三级船闸逐级提高水位，将船体抬升才能通行；驶至另一端时，又需经三级船闸，将船只逐级降至海平面，如此壮观景象，是巴拿马运河所独有的。运河的太平洋入口处紧挨首都巴拿马城，大西洋入口处位于巴拿马第二大城科隆。75年来，全世界约有70万艘船只穿过太平洋和大西洋间的这条运河。
    在新巴拿马运河条约签署后，巴拿马运河每年为巴拿马带来7600万—8100多万美元的收入，而美国在运河上的巨额赢利每年却有2.8亿—3.2亿美元之多，巴拿马运河缩短了美国从东海岸到西海岸的航程一万多公里，对美在军事上控制两洋，加强西半球防务具有重大战略意义。1963年，美军便在运河两岸划定范围为16.1公里的所谓运河区内设立了南方司令部，建立了14个军事基地，常驻军队1万余人，还任命总督，在巴领土上建起“国中之国”。
    为了收回运河主权，巴拿马人民进行了长期不屈不挠的斗争，在1977年9月与美签署了新运河条约。规定美国于1999年12月31日交还全部运河主权，并撤走全部驻军。美为达到2000年后仍继续控制运河，保持自己的军事存在的目的，近一年半来，利用巴拿马国内的矛盾，对巴施加外交压力、进行经济制裁和军事恫吓，巴拿马经济因此遭到严重损害。·旭平·
