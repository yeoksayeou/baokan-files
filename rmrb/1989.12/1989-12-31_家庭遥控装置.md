Recently, a company in West Germany has developed a pocket-sized remote control device for modern home management. This device uses control signals combined with sound to transmit instructions via telephone, thereby achieving remote control. With this device, people can control the switches of household appliances in their homes from another city or even another country by making a phone call, and they can also hear all the sounds in their home.

The pocket-sized remote control device can control household appliances with a total power of up to 3.5 kilowatts through relays installed in the room. By connecting a sensitive microphone to the telephone, one can hear the sounds in their home through the receiver. This invention greatly facilitates people's lives. When you are out or on vacation before returning home, you can use the remote control system to turn on the heating equipment and temperature-humidity regulator in your home, allowing you to enjoy the comfort upon your return.

    家庭遥控装置
    最近，西德一家电器公司研制出一种用于现代家庭管理的袖珍遥控装置，它是将遥控信号作为声音组合通过电话传送指令，从而达到遥控目的。人们利用该装置可以在上班或度假时，从另一个城市甚至另外一个国家通过打电话控制自己家中家用电器的开关，并且还能听到家里发生的一切声音。
    袖珍遥控装置通过安装在室内的继电器可以遥控总功率达3.5千瓦的家用电器，把灵敏传声器接到电话机上通过话筒就可听到自己家中声音了。这一发明大大方便了人们的生活，当你外出或休假回家之前，你可以利用遥控系统打开家里的取暖设备及温湿调节器，使你回家后坐享其成。
