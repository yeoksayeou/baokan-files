To the Editor:

Recently, while visiting the countryside, I heard some people discussing that "the state is going to restrict the development of private economies." They said, "In the past few years, the state encouraged the development of individual cooperative economies, which messed up the state market. The central government said it would clean up and restrict individual economies." Some even said, "Individual economies have made money through tax evasion and speculation. Now, there will be a big cleanup, settling accounts later." "The state will issue policies to restrict the development of individual economies. Farmers going to the city to do business or open third-industry ventures will all have to return to the countryside to farm," and so on. Under these discussions, some individual enterprises are planning to surrender their licenses and close down, while those who want to do business are also feeling uneasy.

The report of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China stated that developing private individual economies as a necessary supplement to state and collective economies should be protected. Currently, will this policy change? This has a significant impact on the entire nation. Therefore, I hope that national newspapers will publish an article to clarify this and stabilize public sentiment.

Yours sincerely,
Zhang Chunsheng
Government of Hancheng Town, Fengrun County, Hebei Province

Reply from the Editor:

Comrade Zhang Chunsheng,

Your letter reflects some situations that we believe are worth noting. At the same time, we would like to use this opportunity to address you and all those who are concerned about the policies on individual and private economies. Please rest assured, the policies on individual and private economies as confirmed by the Thirteenth National Congress have not changed.

Comrade Jiang Zemin clearly stated in his National Day speech: "In the current stage of China, developing individual and private economies that are subordinate to the socialist economy is important and indispensable for developing production, facilitating people's lives, and expanding employment. The practice of the past decade has fully proven this. Our policy is to encourage their development within the scope allowed by the state; secondly, to use economic, administrative, and legal means to strengthen management and guidance, so that they can play a positive role while limiting their negative effects on the development of the socialist economy." This passage clearly explains the central government's policy on individual and private economies. Therefore, the rumors circulating in some places that the policy is going to change are groundless or a misunderstanding. Although individual and private economies do not belong to the public ownership economy, they can indeed supplement the socialist public ownership economy and play a positive role. This guiding ideology has not wavered since the reform and opening up. The basic policy on individual and private economies will not change and cannot change. China's economic development level is still low, and funds are very tight. The pressure of urban and rural employment is still great. Within the scope allowed by the policy, there is still a lot of room for the development of individual and private economies. Over the past decade, many individual business owners and private enterprise operators have indeed emerged as advanced individuals who are good at management, have professional ethics, and are enthusiastic about public welfare.

Of course, we must also see that due to the neglect of management and guidance in recent years, some problems have indeed arisen in the development of individual and private economies. Some engage in illegal operations, raise prices arbitrarily, and bully the market; some produce and sell fake and shoddy goods; some rush into projects blindly and compete with state-owned and collective enterprises for raw materials and markets. Tax evasion is also quite common. These problems have already aroused public indignation, and if not resolved in a timely manner, they will not only be detrimental to the normal development of individual and private economies but will also have a negative impact on the socialist public ownership economy.

It is precisely from this actual situation that the central government, while clearly continuing to encourage the development of individual and private economies, emphasizes the need to strengthen management and guidance. This includes: strengthening tax management to prevent tax evasion; strengthening the management of business activities and cracking down on illegal operations; according to actual needs and situations, restricting the scope of industries, products, and business scales; restricting excessive consumption; and seriously safeguarding the legal rights of hired workers. Strengthening management and guidance is the implementation and improvement of the policy, not a change in the policy. Because the Party and the government have never formulated a policy of laissez-faire for individual and private economies. If this aspect was not done well in the past, starting to strengthen it now will only be more beneficial to the development of individual and private economies, rather than aiming to dismantle them.

Therefore, individual business owners and private enterprise operators can rest assured and continue to do their jobs seriously, develop their businesses, and the key is to operate legally and pay taxes according to the law. This will benefit the country, benefit the people, and also benefit themselves. The legitimate operations of individual businesses and private enterprises will definitely be protected by law and respected by society.

    本报编者答读者问
    个体经济私营经济政策不变《人民日报》
    编辑同志：
    最近，笔者下乡，听到一部分人关于“国家要限制私人经济发展”的议论。他们说：“前几年国家号召发展个体联合体经济的做法搞错了，把国家市场搞乱了，中央说要清理、限制个体经济。”还有的说：“个体经济靠偷税漏税、投机倒把发了财，这回要进行大清理，秋后算帐”。“国家要下政策限制个体经济发展，农民进城经商、开办第三产业的要一律回乡务农”等等。在这些议论下，有的个体企业要交牌照停业，想干的也人心不安。
    党的十三大报告曾把发展私人个体经济作为国家和集体经济的必要补充，加以保护，眼下，这个政策会不会改变，对全国人民影响很大。为此，希望国家报刊就此发表文章，予以澄清，以稳定人心。
                河北省丰润县韩城镇政府　张春生
    编者复信
    张春生同志：
    你的来信反映的一些情况，我们认为值得重视。同时想借这个机会，向你及一切关心个体经济、私营经济政策问题的同志，讲几句话。请放心，党的十三大确定的有关个体经济和私营经济的政策，并没有改变。
    江泽民同志在国庆讲话中明确指出：“在我国现阶段，发展从属于社会主义经济的个体经济、私营经济，对于发展社会生产、方便人民生活、扩大劳动就业，具有重要的不可缺少的作用。十年来改革的实践，充分证明了这一点。我们的方针，一是要鼓励它们在国家允许的范围内积极发展；二是要运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段，加强管理和引导，做到既发挥它们的积极作用，又限制其不利于社会主义经济发展的消极作用。”这段话非常清楚地阐述了中央关于个体、私人经济方面的政策。因此，社会上有些地方流传的所谓有关政策要变的议论，是没有根据的，或者说是一种误解。尽管个体经济、私营经济不属于公有制经济，但它们是完全可以作为社会主义公有制经济的补充，发挥积极作用的。改革开放以来，这个指导思想是从未动摇过的。在对待个体经济和私营经济的基本政策上，国家不会改，也不可能改。我国的经济发展水平还很低，资金十分紧张，城乡就业压力还很大。在政策允许的范围内，个体经济、私营经济都还有很大发展余地。10年来，个体户和私人企业经营者当中也确实涌现了一些善于经营，讲职业道德、热心公益的先进分子。
    当然，我们也必须看到，由于近年来忽视了管理和引导工作，个体经济、私营经济发展中也确实出现了一些值得注意的问题。有的违法经营，乱涨价，欺行霸市；有的制造、销售伪劣商品；有的盲目上马，与国营、集体企业争原料、争市场。偷税漏税问题更是相当普遍。这些问题，已经引起了社会公愤，如不及时解决，不仅不利于个体经济、私营经济的正常发展，而且会对社会主义公有制经济产生消极影响。
    正是从这种实际情况出发，中央在明确继续鼓励个体经济、私营经济发展的同时，强调必须加强管理和引导。主要包括：加强税收管理，杜绝偷税漏税；加强对经营活动的管理，取缔违法经营；根据实际情况和需要，限制行业范围、产品范围和经营规模；限制过度消费；认真维护雇佣工人的合法权益等。加强管理和引导，是政策的实施和完善，而不是政策的改变。因为党和政府从来没有制订过对个体经济、私营经济可以放任自流的政策。过去这方面做得不够，现在开始加强，只会更有利于个体经济、私营经济发展，而不是要把它们整垮。
    所以，个体户、私人企业的经营者，完全可以安心继续认真做好自己的事情，开展自己的事业，关键是要守法经营，照章纳税，这样就会利国、利民，也对自己有利。个体户和私人企业的正当经营一定会受到法律的保护和社会的尊重。　——编者
