The report "Two Clean Sleeves on the Beijing-Guangzhou Line" tells the story of the upright police officer Ma Yili Hong, whose integrity and dedication are deeply moving and inspiring. Ma Yili Hong, through his actions, demonstrates that integrity begets authority.

It is well known that in our country, the people are the masters, and the people's police are the faithful guardians of the people. They faithfully perform the duties entrusted to them by law, which is a concrete manifestation of their loyalty to the Party, the country, and the people. Therefore, when the people's police perform their duties in accordance with the law, they naturally deserve the respect and support of the people. Any actions that obstruct the people's police from performing their duties are unacceptable to the people and the law.

For the people's police to faithfully perform their duties, they must first be honest and self-disciplined. The majority of public security personnel are on the front lines of fighting crime and protecting the people, often facing various illegal and criminal activities head-on. Some criminals, to avoid legal punishment, will use all sorts of despicable and shameful tactics. In such circumstances, some weak-willed individuals in our ranks may be struck down by "sweet bullets," even to the point of committing illegal acts while enforcing the law.

On the other hand, when the people's police perform their duties to protect the people's interests, they naturally receive the support and admiration of the people. Some people, out of gratitude, may also try to express their thanks through gifts of money or goods. Faced with these, especially those with ulterior motives, if one loses the political integrity that a people's police officer should have—"neither wealth nor power can corrupt me, neither threats nor force can bend me"—it would be impossible to maintain the integrity and resolve of Comrade Ma Yili Hong, who has long adhered to the principle of "in poverty, be even more steadfast, and do not abandon your noble aspirations." It would be impossible to stand firm and clearly uphold the law in the face of temptations of money and material goods.

Integrity begets authority. In the public security forces, because the majority of officers, like Ma Yili Hong, are honest and dedicated, working hard and faithful to their duties, they have created a stable social order for the country's economic construction and the people's lives, making important contributions to the country's stability. Therefore, they have earned the trust of the Party and the government, and the praise and admiration of the people.

In the future, as law-enforcing police officers, we should not only maintain integrity and self-discipline but also become the strongest force in upholding integrity and opposing corruption.

    廉能生威
    通讯《两袖清风走京广》报道的乘警姚立荣为警清廉的事迹，感人至深，令人振奋。姚立荣用自己的行动告诉人们：廉能生威。
    众所周知，在我们国家里，人民是主人，人民警察是人民群众的忠诚卫士。他们忠实履行法律赋予的职责，就是忠于党、忠于祖国、忠于人民的具体体现。因而，人民警察在依法履行职责时，也理所当然地应当受到人们的尊重和支持。任何对公安干警履行职责进行阻扰的言行，都是人民群众和国家法律所不容许的。
    人民警察要忠实地行使自己的职责，首先必须廉洁自律。广大公安干警处在打击罪犯、保护人民的第一线，经常要同各种违法犯罪行为进行面对面的斗争，一些犯罪分子为了逃避法律的制裁，各种卑鄙无耻的手段都能使得出来。在这种情况下，我们队伍中某些意志薄弱者，就有可能被“糖弹”击中，甚至做出执法犯法的事情来。
    另一方面，人民警察在履行保护人民利益的职责时，必然受到人民群众的拥护和支持。一些群众出于感激之情，也可能以送钱送物的方式来报答。面对这些，特别是面对那些别有用心的“馈赠”，如果丧失了人民警察所应有的“富贵不能淫，威武不能屈”的政治品质，就不可能像姚立荣同志那样，长期恪守“穷且益坚，不坠青云之志”的节操，就不会在金钱和物质的诱惑面前，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地依法办事。
    廉能生威，在公安队伍中，由于广大干警像姚立荣那样廉洁奉公、努力工作、忠于职守，为国家的经济建设和人民的生活创造了安定的社会秩序，为国家的稳定做出了重要贡献，因而，他们受到党和政府的信赖，赢得了人民群众的褒扬和称赞。
    今后，作为执法的人民警察，不仅应该以廉洁自律，而且还应成为维护廉洁、反对腐败的最坚强的力量。
