In recent years, Cui Xiuzhen and the Black Dragon River Province National Economic Development Company he leads have taken from society and used for society, with a selfless spirit of dedication, accomplishing many things and inspiring millions of people.

Cui Xiuzhen, an ethnic Korean, is 39 years old this year. In his childhood, when he was a team leader in primary school, the story of Lei Feng left a deep impression on him. He has always admired the spirit of Lei Feng. However, such a young man, due to his poor family background, suffered unjust treatment for more than ten years during the Cultural Revolution. It was after the Gang of Four was smashed that the Party gave him a second life, allowing him to hold his head high; it was the era of reform and opening up that gave him the opportunity to make his life vibrant with struggle. In July 1985, he established the Black Dragon River Province National Economic Development Company in Harbin, composed of six ethnic groups including Koreans, Hui, Mongols, and Manchus. At that time, Cui Xiuzhen, after years of tempering, had matured in thought and his horizons had broadened. He deeply felt that an individual's fate is inseparable from the nation's fate; without the nation's prosperity, there can be no personal happiness. A nation, a person, if they want to stand up and achieve something, must have a spirit, a will.

“First for the collective ‘home,’ then for one’s own home”

When speculators were rampant in society and many companies were solely focused on making money, they remained steadfast in considering the bigger picture, often sacrificing the company's interests to protect national interests. They used domestic long-distance products through foreign trade to exchange for domestically scarce chemical materials. If they were to speculate, they could make a fortune, but Cui Xiuzhen issued a strict order: scarce materials must be supplied to manufacturing enterprises and national material departments, and must not be dealt with by unrelated companies and individuals. Because they kept their contracts and maintained their credibility, treating people sincerely, the company's economic benefits soared. In 1988, the operating volume was 120 million yuan, with a profit and tax of 22 million yuan. In the first half of this year, the operating volume was 150 million yuan, with a profit and tax of 18 million yuan, and the per capita profit and tax reached over 200,000 yuan for two consecutive years.

The company became wealthy, so how should the funds be allocated?

With money, it is reasonable to improve one's life, but Cui Xiuzhen formulated such a fund allocation procedure: first the state, second the collective, third the individual. He proposed using 10% to support poverty alleviation in minority areas, 3% to support minority education, and 2% for employees' wages, bonuses, and welfare. He patiently did the employees' ideological work: "Now the country's foundation is too weak, and our company is still in the start-up stage. We must first take care of the collective 'home' and then our own home. We must tighten our belts and endure for a few more years."

The employees believed the general manager's words because Cui Xiuzhen himself has been busier and more hardworking than anyone else these years. For the company, he has been traveling domestically and internationally for many years, visiting North Korea 17 times for trade negotiations. Once, when he was sick, he continued to work for several days with an IV drip, and when it was time to leave, he removed the needle and hobbled onto the plane to the Soviet Union. He has the most right to enjoy the fruits of hard work, but he gave the two new apartments he received after his private relocation to employees to live in, and he still lives in a very simple room, with a boiler room downstairs that hums day and night. Many foreign businessmen, when visiting his home, expressed their desire to use the company's money to improve his living conditions, but he politely declined. He said: "As a member of the Chinese nation, I have no reason to enjoy the fruits of everyone's hard work before my nation and before the employees of my company."

The power of example is profound and vast. The employees are willing to continue living a hard life with him. This financially strong company still has not bought a shuttle car; employees living in six districts squeeze onto public buses for work; the logistics department manager still lives in an 8-square-meter "pigeon coop"; employees' wages have always been maintained at the level of medium-sized enterprises, with Cui Xiuzhen earning 190 yuan, the lowest-paid employee earning 50 yuan, and bonuses strictly distributed according to regulations.

The company's headquarters was originally in a dilapidated 24-square-meter side room in the Dao Wai District of Harbin. They have been working here for three whole years since the company was established. Every time a foreign businessman steps into the door, they are surprised, but when they see the "dada" sound of the telex machine and fax machine in the corner, and the busy and serious company employees, they cannot help but show respect. Cui Xiuzhen established such a company with Chinese characteristics.

Cui Xiuzhen believes that "collective enterprises have no constraints and are easily corrupted, so they need more self-respect, more integrity, and more hard work." On November 5 this year, they held an office meeting and specially formulated six regulations, requiring company cadres to be clear about public and private matters, and to be honest and upright.

Some people say they are a "foolish company"

Some people say that the National Economic Development Company is a "foolish company." Because in recent years, they have done many "foolish" things.

More than 20 elderly people from Chaoxian Village, Nianfeng Township, Tieli City, went to Jianhu Lake for a tour. While passing through Harbin, the 2,000 yuan they had saved with great difficulty was stolen, and the elderly people were at a loss. Cui Xiuzhen heard about this and said emotionally, "Who doesn't have parents?" He immediately took out 200 yuan from his own pocket and called on company employees to donate money, believing it was a good opportunity to increase everyone's sense of social responsibility. When the office director handed the 2,500 yuan donated by everyone to the elderly, the elderly cried like children.

A graduate from the second middle school in Harbin, Shi Ying, with excellent results, was admitted to Tsinghua University, but because her stepmother, who worked as a janitor, could not afford to support her, she decided not to continue her studies. Teachers were saddened, and they collected 300 yuan, 5 yuan here and 10 yuan there, which was still a drop in the bucket. The principal found Cui Xiuzhen, and Cui Xiuzhen immediately decided: "From the time Shi Ying starts school until she graduates, the company will provide 50 yuan of living expenses per month, and in the future, if she studies for a master's degree, a doctorate, or goes abroad to study, the company will be responsible for everything." A Canadian businessman was deeply moved and also took out 200 dollars, wanting to join the company's ranks.

In early 1986, he brought the company's core members to two of the poorest Korean villages in Lianzhu Township, Mishan County. As soon as he entered the school, Cui Xiuzhen's eyes welled up with tears: the classroom door was hanging crooked, there was not a single piece of glass in the windows, and the desks and chairs were incomplete. Cui Xiuzhen, impatient, immediately mobilized various departments to save administrative expenses, raising 5,000 yuan, and sent someone to buy desks and chairs to the school. They then went to a widow's house, where four children were thin and malnourished, and their clothes were tattered. Cui Xiuzhen wanted to give money to help but feared it would cause a big scene, so he took his colleagues to the village secretary's house, wanting the secretary to hand over the money. But seeing that the secretary's house was the only brick house in the village, fully equipped with electrical appliances, and tastefully decorated, he got angry and shouted at the secretary: "Your family is so rich, and your villagers are so poor, do you have the face to do this? Are you qualified to be a Communist Party member?"

Coming out of the secretary's house, he sighed all the way: The spirit of Lei Feng is a precious spiritual wealth of our Chinese nation. Unfortunately, in recent years, some of us have forgotten the spirit of Lei Feng. As a small enterprise manager, I am powerless to change the situation, but I can at least start with myself and be a Lei Feng-style entrepreneur.

“Our responsibility is to plant more trees”

On the way back from Mishan to Harbin, Cui Xiuzhen could not sleep on the train. The various scenes in the poor villages of his own nation made him uncomfortable. He thought, after being poor for so many years, could a few dollars from Cui Xiuzhen solve the problem? The State Ethnic Affairs Commission also gives relief funds, and they are still poor?

What to do? They discussed the whole way, and the consensus was to use the local graphite mine resources to establish the Lianzhu Mountain Graphite Mine, sending Vice Manager Jin Zhengkui to conduct a survey.

After three on-site investigations, Jin Zhengkui submitted a feasibility report for the mine, stating that a mine producing 2,000 tons per year could employ 200 villagers, adding 200,000 to 400,000 yuan in income for the two villages each year, greatly improving the living conditions of the local people. However, the construction of the mine required a total investment of 2 million yuan, which was a huge figure for the company in 1986. Cui Xiuzhen could not forget those worried faces, and with the determination of "selling everything in my family if necessary, I will build the mine," he persuaded everyone to invest the company's profits from 1986 and 1987 entirely in building the mine.

The fate of the company was at stake. When sending Jin Zhengkui off, the atmosphere was solemn. Cui Xiuzhen, holding Jin Zhengkui's hand tightly, said: "This heavy burden is on your shoulders. If the task is not completed, we will have a hard time seeing our fellow villagers!" Jin Zhengkui did not disappoint everyone. After a year and a half of hard work, 1,500 tons of graphite were produced in 1988, with a net profit of 500,000 yuan. In 1989, it is expected to have a net profit of 1.3 million yuan. Now, the surrounding area of the mine has changed, and a part of the people have begun to get rich, with many red brick houses appearing in the village.

Soon, Cui Xiuzhen's gaze went beyond one family, one household, one village. He saw that to prosper and strengthen, education must be revitalized, and people's cultural quality must be improved. The company allocated 4 million yuan to recruit more than 130 minority high school graduates who failed the college entrance examination from all over the province, adopting the "four guarantees" method of covering tuition, book fees, living expenses, and accommodation fees, to send them to college. To cultivate talents for the nation and society.

In August 1988, they allocated 2 million yuan from the company's profits to establish the Black Dragon River Province Minority Education Foundation, and at the end of the year, they allocated an additional 3 million yuan, planning to expand to 20 million yuan by 1990, to support and develop minority education in the entire province. This year, on Teachers' Day, the company allocated 600,000 yuan to hold a provincial minority teachers' award ceremony, awarding 5 advanced collectives and 156 advanced teachers from 8 minority nationalities. Cui Xiuzhen said at the meeting: "Our generation's responsibility is to plant more trees, our generation's responsibility is to provide shade for future generations! Education should be revived in our generation." Many teachers, tears in their eyes, applauded for him.

In recent years, this company has donated 5.8 million yuan to support and develop national economies and education, and to contribute to society.

Recently, the government of Yanshou County thanked him for leading the company to donate 3 million yuan to support a middle school in the county and wanted to erect a statue of him. He firmly refused, saying: "The company's mission is: wealth is taken from society and used for society. There is nothing worth boasting about for an individual."

    奉献给社会　奉献给人民
    ——记崔秀镇和他领导的黑龙江省民族经济开发总公司
    毕国顺
    近年来，崔秀镇和他领导的黑龙江省民族经济开发总公司，取之于社会，用之于社会，以无私的奉献精神，办成了不少事情，感染了千万人。
    崔秀镇，朝鲜族人，今年39岁。童年时代，他在小学当大队长时，雷锋的故事给他留下深深的印象，他从小崇尚雷锋精神。可这样一个青年，却因出身不好，在“文革”中十多年受到不公正待遇。是粉碎“四人帮”后，党给了他第二次生命，使他能够抬头做人；是改革开放的时代，给了他机会，使他的生命焕发出奋斗的活力。1985年7月，他在哈尔滨创办了由朝、回、蒙、满等6个民族组成的黑龙江省民族经济开发总公司。这时的崔秀镇，经多年磨砺，思想上成熟起来，眼界也日渐开阔。他深深感到，个人的命运与国家的命运是分不开的，没有国家的振兴就没有个人的幸福。一个民族，一个人要想站立起来，有所作为，必须有一点精神，有一股志气。
    “先为大家的‘家’，再为自己的家”
    当社会上“倒爷”横行，许多公司一心捞钱的时候，他们毫不动摇地顾全大局，常常以牺牲企业利益来维护国家利益。他们用国内长线产品通过对外贸易换回国内紧缺的化工材料，如果“倒”，可以发大财，但崔秀镇下死命令，紧俏材料一律供应生产厂家、供应国家物资部门，一律不准与无关公司和个人打交道。由于他们讲合同，守信誉，以诚恳待人，公司经济效益蒸蒸日上。1988年经营额为1.2亿元，利税2200万元，今年上半年经营额为1.5亿元，利税1800万元，人均利税连续两年达20多万元。
    企业富了，该如何支配资金呢？
    有了钱，照理也该改善生活了，可崔秀镇却制定了这样一个资金安排程序：一国家、二集体、三个人。他提议用10％投入少数民族地区扶贫，3％支援少数民族教育，2％用于职工工资、奖金和福利。他耐心地做职工的思想工作：“现在国家底子太薄，我们公司仍处于创业阶段，要先为大家的‘家’，再为自己的家，要勒紧腰带，再忍几年。”
    职工们信服总经理的话，因为崔秀镇自己这些年比谁都忙都艰苦。他为公司，常年奔波于海内外，17次赴朝鲜洽谈贸易。有一回病了，吊着输液瓶还连续办公数日，该出发时，拔下吊针，他一瘸一拐地踏上了去苏联的路程。他比谁都有权利享受，可他把私房动迁后分得的两套新居让给职工住，自己至今住在很简陋的房子里，底下是锅炉房，早晚“嗡嗡”作响。许多外商到他家作客时，都表示要用商社的钱为他改善居住条件，他都婉言谢绝。他说：“我作为中华民族的一员，没有任何理由，先于我的民族，先于我公司的职工，去享受大家艰苦奋斗的果实。”
    榜样的力量是深沉而博大的。职工们甘心情愿跟着他继续过艰苦生活。这个财大气粗的公司，至今没买通勤车，家住六个区的职工，上下班挤公共汽车；至今没盖职工宿舍，储运科长现还住8平方米的“鸽子窝”；职工工资一直保持中等企业水平，崔秀镇工资190元，职工最低50元，奖金严格照规定发放。
    公司的大本营原来在哈尔滨市道外区一间寒酸的24平方米的偏厦房中。他们从创业时就在这里整整工作了三年。每次，外商迈进门坎，都会露出惊讶的神色，可当他瞥见屋角“答答”作响的电传机、传真机等现代化办公设备，看见忙碌而认真的公司职工，都不禁肃然起敬。崔秀镇创办的就是这样一家具有中国特色的企业。
    崔秀镇认为，“集体企业没有约束，很容易腐败，所以更需要自尊自爱，更需要廉洁，更需要艰苦奋斗”。今年11月5日，他们召开办公会议，又专门制定了六条规定，要求公司干部公私分明、廉洁奉公。
    别人说他们是“傻冒公司”
    有人说民族经济开发公司是办“傻冒公司”。因为他们这些年办了不少“傻事”。
    铁力市年丰乡朝鲜村20多位老人到镜泊湖旅游，途经哈尔滨时，辛辛苦苦攒的2000元路费被偷，老人们进退不得。崔秀镇听说后，很动感情地说：“谁家没有父母？”当场他个人拿出200元，同时号召公司职工捐款，认为这是一次增加大家社会义务感的好机会。当公司办公室主任把大家捐的2500元交给老人们时，老人们孩子般地哭了。
    哈市朝二中毕业生石英以优异成绩考入清华大学，但因继母当勤杂工无力供养，她决定不念了。教师们为之痛惜，你5元他10元的凑了300元，仍是杯水车薪。校长找到崔秀镇，崔秀镇当即决定：“石英从上学到毕业，公司每月提供生活费50元，将来考硕士、博士到出国留学，公司负责到底。”一位加拿大客商听后，大为感动，也掏出200美元，要参加到公司的行列里。
    1986年初，他带着公司的骨干们来到密山县连珠乡的两个最穷的朝鲜族村子。一进小学校，崔秀镇眼泪流了下来：教室门斜吊着，窗户上没一块玻璃，桌椅残缺不全。崔秀镇性急，当场动员各部门节省行政费用，凑足5000元，派专人买桌椅送到学校。他们又来到一户寡妇家，四个孩子面黄肌瘦，衣不遮体。崔秀镇要拿钱帮助又怕引出一个大哭的场面，于是带着同事们到村支书家，想让支书把钱转交。可一见支书家住全村唯一的砖瓦房，家里电器俱全，布置讲究，他就火了，冲支书大嚷：“你家这么富，你的村民那么穷，你好意思吗？你称职吗？你配当共产党员吗？”
    由支书家出来，他一路叹息：雷锋精神是咱中华民族的宝贵精神财富。可惜这些年，我们中的一些人把雷锋精神忘了，我做为一个小企业经理，无力扭转乾坤，但我至少可以从我做起，当一个雷锋式的企业家。
    “我们的责任就是多栽树”
    那次由密山回哈尔滨，崔秀镇在火车上不能入睡。本民族穷苦村落里的种种情景让他难受。他想，穷了这么多年，穷到这个份上，就靠我崔秀镇施舍的几个钱能解决问题吗？国家民委不也给救济金吗？他们不还受穷吗？
    怎么办呢？整整议论了一路，大家的意见是利用当地石墨矿资源开办连珠山石墨矿，派副经理金政奎去做调查。
    金政奎三次实地调查后，拿出了建矿可行性报告，建一年产2000吨矿可安排200名村民，每年为两村增加收入20万元至40万元。可大大改善当地人民生活。但建矿需总投资200万元，这对1986年的公司来说是一个庞大的数字。崔秀镇无法忘记那些愁苦的脸，他以“宁可把我家一切卖掉，也要建矿”的决心说服众人，把公司1986、1987两年的留利全部投去建矿。
    事关公司的存亡。送金政奎上路时，气氛是悲壮的。崔秀镇紧握着金政奎的手说：“这千斤担子让你挑了，完不成任务，咱们就难见乡亲了！”
    金政奎不负众望，艰苦创业一年半，1988年产石墨1500吨，获纯利50万元。1989年预计可获纯利130万元。如今，这个矿的周围发生了变化，一部分人开始富了，村里出现不少红砖房。
    很快，崔秀镇的目光就越过了一家一户一个村落。他看到，要繁荣富强，必须振兴教育，提高人的文化素质。公司拿出40万元，从全省各地招收130多名少数民族高考落榜青年，采取包学费、书费、生活费、宿费的“四包”办法，供他们上大学。为民族培养干部，为社会培养人才。
    1988年8月，他们从公司利润中拿出20万元成立黑龙江省少数民族教育基金会，当年底又增拨30万元，计划1990年增扩至200万元，用来扶植和发展全省少数民族教育事业。今年教师节，公司又拿出6万元召开全省少数民族教师奖励大会，奖励8个少数民族的5个先进集体，156个先进教师。崔秀镇在会上说：“我们这一代的责任就是多栽树，我们这一代的责任就是为后代献上一片荫凉！教育理应在我们这一代复兴。”许多教师流着泪为他鼓掌。
    几年来，这个公司为扶持和发展民族经济和教育，为社会奉献资金580万元。
    最近，延寿县政府感谢他领导的公司拿出30万元扶持了县一所中学，要给他个人塑像，他坚决拒绝。他说：“我们公司的宗旨是：财富取之于社会，用之于社会。个人没有什么值得夸耀的。”
