This year marks the 1000th anniversary of the birth of Fan Zhongyan. In his "Yueyang Tower Record," he wrote, "Worry before the people worry, and be happy after the people are happy," which has truly become a timeless saying.

In fact, few scholars in feudal society could truly achieve this. Only those who have armed themselves with Marxism-Leninism and regard the world as their responsibility, the Chinese Communist Party, have truly taken Fan Zhongyan's saying as their motto and goal. Worry before the people worry, and be happy after the people are happy. In today's terms, this means "serve the people wholeheartedly," "selflessly serve others," and "suffer first and enjoy later." It is a spirit of fearless and selfless dedication. Throughout the history of our party, whether in the war-torn years or in today's socialist construction, how many heroes and models have practiced Fan Zhongyan's saying! The Chinese Communist Party is not precisely the great collective that struggles with this principle!

Of course, within our party, there are some party members who are not very exemplary, and there are even some who have tarnished the glorious name of our party. The party has always been uncompromising in criticizing and struggling against them, which is precisely the source of our party's boundless vitality and the hallmark that distinguishes our party from other exploiting class parties. Therefore, those "elites" who take it upon themselves to criticize the party and the country, using the shortcomings, errors, and a few corrupt elements within the party to paint our party as completely black, attempting to create an atmosphere of "overthrowing" and "toppling" the party, are merely politically motivated.

On the banks of the vast Huangpu River, Shanghai is China's largest city, the most prosperous city, and the city that opened up the earliest. It is a world-famous city like Tokyo, London, Paris, and New York. However, who knows that it is in Shanghai where seven deputy mayors work in just three offices! The "elites" are not self-proclaimed experts in history and culture? Then let them compare and investigate, see if any government officials in the major cities of the world, including the mayors of old Shanghai, can be as "happy after the people are happy" as they are.

It can be said with certainty: No one can.

    后天下而乐
    吴昊
    今年是范仲淹老先生诞辰1000周年纪念。他在《岳阳楼记》里写下的“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”，真的成了千古名言。
    其实，封建社会的士大夫对此是很少有人做得到的。只有用马列主义武装起来的、视天下为己任的中国共产党人，才真正把范老先生的名言作为自己的座右铭和奋斗目标。先天下而忧，后天下而乐，用今天的话说，就是“全心全意为人民服务”，“毫不利己，专门利人”，“吃苦在前，享受在后”，就是无畏无私的奉献精神。在我们党的历史上，不管是硝烟弥漫的战争年代，还是社会主义建设的今天，该有多少英雄模范实践了范老先生的名言。中国共产党不正是本着这个原则而奋斗的伟大集体吗！
    当然，在我们党内也有一些不怎么争气的党员，甚至有一些玷污了我们党的光辉名称的党员。对于他们，党从来都是毫不留情地进行批评和斗争的，这正是我们党具有无限生机的力量源泉，正是我们党区别于其他剥削阶级的政党的标志。因此，那些以骂党、骂国为己任的“精英”们，利用某些党员的缺点、错误和极个别的党内败类，把我们党描绘得漆黑一团，企图制造“打倒”“推翻”党的舆论，不过是政治上的别有用心罢了。
    滔滔黄浦江畔的上海，是中国最大的城市，最繁华的城市，开放最早的城市，是和东京、伦敦、巴黎、纽约一样是世界名城。然而有谁知道，就是在上海，七个副市长挤在三间办公室里办公！“精英”们不是以通今博古自居吗，那就请你们比一比、查一查，看看世界上各大城市的政府官员，包括旧上海的历代市长，有谁能像他们这样“后天下而乐”？
    可以肯定地说：没有。
