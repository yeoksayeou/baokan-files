The nursery of sports needs attention
— A call from the Baoding Sports Kindergarten

The Baoding Municipal Sports Commission established the first sports kindergarten in the country in September 1984. Through media publicity and introductions, it has now gained international recognition. More than 20 countries and regions have sent visitors to observe and highly evaluate the kindergarten.

Over the past five years, the sports kindergarten has made remarkable achievements through hard work: it has graduated 10 classes totaling 450 students, of whom 300 were selected to attend the municipal key amateur sports schools. Seven students from the first and second graduating classes of the gymnastics program were selected for the provincial sports teams. The 10-year-old age group of the youth soccer class participated in the August horse island soccer summer camp and won the "Baby Cup" team first place in all technical tests and the intelligence test team championship.

Sports activities have effectively developed and cultivated children's memory, thinking, and physical abilities, which is vividly demonstrated here.

However, Zhang Xiaogong, the principal, is now very anxious. Since all economic sources rely on tuition fees, the kindergarten's funds are clearly insufficient, and the kindergarten is reluctant to increase tuition fees. This predicament makes it difficult to replace the old and insufficient equipment, which in turn reduces the number of applicants. The 60% transfer rate is hard to maintain.

The determination of the leaders of the Municipal Sports Commission is touching; they said, "No matter how great the difficulties, we will do our best to overcome them and continuously improve this kindergarten, making it better and better!" The municipal government leaders not only highly evaluated the sports kindergarten in front of United Nations guests and various levels of leaders but also sent timely aid—allocating 300,000 yuan in funds to relieve the kindergarten's urgent needs in a time of extreme financial strain.

People hope that the sports kindergarten can receive support from all sectors, enabling its development and cultivating more talents for the country.

### 体育苗圃需要关心——来自保定体育幼儿园的呼声

    体育苗圃需要关心
    ——来自保定体育幼儿园的呼声
    保定市体委于1984年9月创办的全国第一所体育幼儿园，经新闻媒介的宣传介绍，如今已名扬海外。有20多个国家、地区的外宾慕名前来参观，给予高度评价。
    体育幼儿园5年来，艰苦创业成绩显著：送走毕业班10个共450人，其中300人被选送到市重点业余体校。体操班一、二期毕业的孩子中有7人被选入省级运动队。小足球班10岁年龄组今年8月参加养马岛足球夏令营，获“娃娃杯”各项技术测验团体第一，智力测验团体冠军。
    体育运动使幼儿在记忆、思维、体能诸方面得到及时的开发培养，在这里得到生动有力的验证。
    然而，如今张效恭园长却很焦虑。由于一切经济来源都靠幼儿学费，办园经费明显不够，而园里又不忍心增加学费。窘境使幼儿园陈旧而不足的设备无法更置。这种状况使申请入园者有所减少，60％的输送率已难保持。
    市体委领导的决心使人感动，他们表示：“不管多大困难我们也要尽力克服，而且要不断完善这所体幼园，使它越办越好！”市政府领导不仅在联合国来宾与各级领导面前对体育幼儿园高度评价，而且雪中送炭——在经费极端紧张的情况下拨款三万元，以解幼儿园燃眉之急。
    人们希望体育幼儿园能得到各界的支持，使其得到发展，为国家培养出更多人才。　　沈行省
