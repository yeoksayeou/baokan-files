The Huimin region of Shandong Province has organized the masses to vigorously reclaim land and plant cotton, achieving remarkable economic and social benefits. This year alone, various counties and cities in the region have reclaimed 340,000 mu of land for cotton planting, harvesting over 250,000 piculs of cotton lint, making it the region with the most reclaimed land for cotton planting in the entire province. Reclamation and cotton planting have increased the income of cotton farmers in the region by over 50 million yuan.

Huimin is one of the main cotton-producing regions in Shandong Province. In recent years, they have first formulated policies to encourage the reclamation and planting of cotton: whoever reclaimed the wasteland will contract it, with a contract period of more than 15 years, and the contract rights can be inherited by children or transferred for a fee. For newly reclaimed land, there will be no deductions for five years, no agricultural tax, and no increase in the quota for mandatory purchases.

    惠民开荒植棉见成效
    据新华社济南12月18日电　（记者孙明振）山东省惠民地区组织群众大力开荒种棉，取得显著的经济效益和社会效益。仅今年全区各县市就开荒种棉34万亩，收获皮棉25万多担，是全省开荒植棉最多的地区。开荒植棉使全区棉农增加收入5000多万元。
    惠民地区是山东省棉花主产区之一。近几年，他们首先制定了鼓励开荒植棉的政策：荒地谁开垦谁承包，承包期15年以上，承包权可由子女继承也可以有偿转让；新开荒地5年不交提留，不拿农业税，不增加订购基数。
