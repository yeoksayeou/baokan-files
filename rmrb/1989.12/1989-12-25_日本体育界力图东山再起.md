Japan's sports sector, after a period of adjustment, is ambitious and has formulated a series of measures to restore Japan's sports to their former glory.

Looking back at the history of modern world sports, one can see several glorious pages about Japan. In the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, the Japanese performed exceptionally well, securing third place in the gold medal tally both times, behind only the USA and the USSR. In Asia, Japan's status was even more prominent. In the first eight Asian Games, Japan consistently topped the charts, leaving other Asian countries far behind.

However, in the 1980s, Japanese sports began to decline. In the 1982 New Delhi Asian Games, Japan lost its Asian dominance, finishing behind China in the gold medal count. In the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, Japan fell further behind South Korea, finishing third.

Faced with this continuous decline, various sectors in Japan are paying close attention. The Prime Minister has repeatedly inquired about sports, and public opinion has been offering suggestions, with a strong resolve to rebuild and regain strength.

However, despite the loud calls for action, there has been little substantial support. While there are many who beat their chests and lament, and many who offer suggestions, those who are willing to contribute financially are few. Although Japan is an economic powerhouse, its sports sector still struggles with financial constraints, often running at a deficit. Under these circumstances, revitalizing sports can only be a pipe dream. Several years have passed, and Japanese sports remain stagnant, showing no signs of a comeback.

This August, amidst public dissatisfaction, the Japanese Olympic Committee underwent a major overhaul, electing billionaire Teruichi Tsuji as the new chairman. Teruichi Tsuji is a railway magnate who is passionate about sports and owns professional sports clubs such as the Seibu Baseball Team.

After taking office, Teruichi Tsuji implemented a series of measures to turn the dream of revitalizing sports into reality. He proposed that Japan's sports strategy should be to "win as many Olympic medals as possible." To this end, the Japanese Olympic Committee is discussing measures such as establishing a national sports training center, hiring more high-level professional athletes, recruiting foreign coaches, providing more economic subsidies to athletes, and attracting young people to participate in sports.

Teruichi Tsuji, with his substantial financial resources, proposed increasing the Japanese Olympic Committee's budget from the current $16 million to $140 million within two to three years. Despite his wealth, Teruichi Tsuji is not willing to bear such a large financial burden alone and is currently exploring ways to raise funds through lotteries, sports taxes, corporate sponsorships, and other means.

This 55-year-old new chairman believes that the path to revitalizing Japanese sports is fraught with challenges. "Even if the budget increases tenfold, the money given to athletes will never be as much as that given to professional baseball teams."

    日本体育界力图东山再起
    康兵
    近来，经过调整的日本体育界雄心勃勃，制订一系列措施，力图恢复日本体育昔日的繁荣。
    翻开现代世界体育史，可以看到有关日本的辉煌几页。在1964年的东京奥运会和1968年的墨西哥城奥运会上，日本人战绩不凡，两次获金牌总数第三，仅居美、苏之后。在亚洲，日本的地位更是显赫。前八届亚运会，日本稳当魁首，使其它亚洲国家望尘莫及。
    进入80年代后，日本体育却每况愈下。在1982年的新德里亚运会上，日本失去亚洲霸主地位，金牌数位于中国之后。1986年汉城亚运会上，日本又退到南朝鲜后面，排第3名。
    面对这种一跌再跌的滑坡现象，日本各界非常关注。首相多次过问体育，大众舆论献计献策，大有卧薪尝胆、重整旗鼓之势。
    但雷声大、雨点小，尽管捶胸顿足者有之，议论纷纷者有之，而慷慨解囊者寡。日本虽是一个经济大国，体育界经费仍不免捉襟见肘，入不敷出。在此情形下，振兴体育只能是画饼充饥。几年过去了，日本体育仍止步不前，看不出重新“发迹”之兆。
    今年8月，在国民的不满声中，日本奥林匹克委员会大改组，选出了以亿万富翁堤吉明为主席的新领导核心。堤吉明是铁路运输大亨，热衷体育，拥有西武棒球队等职业体育俱乐部。
    上台后，堤吉明采取一系列措施，以使振兴体育的梦想成为现实。他提出日本的体育战略是“尽可能多地获得奥运会奖牌”。为此，日本奥委会正在讨论诸如建立一个全国体育训练中心，雇用更多的高水平职业选手，聘请外籍教练，给运动员以更多的经济补贴，吸引青少年投身体育运动等措施。
    堤吉明财大气粗，提出在2、3年内，将日本奥委会预算由今年的1600万美元提高到1.4亿美元。堤吉明尽管富有，但也不愿独自担负这么大的数额，目前正在探讨通过彩票、体育税、公司赞助及其它途径凑齐经费。
    这位55岁的新主席认为，日本体育的振兴之路上布满了荆棘。“即使预算增长十倍，给运动员的钱财也绝不会像职业棒球队那么多”。
