Over the past decade, our literary theory has undergone reflection and rectification, making significant progress in overcoming tendencies such as dogmatism, vulgar sociology, and oversimplification. We have also done considerable work in introducing and importing various 20th-century foreign literary theories and their works. We have taken steps in addressing some urgent contemporary literary theory issues. These achievements are evident and undeniable. However, over these years, due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization trends and the neglect and underestimation of the study and research of Marxist-Leninist literary theory and Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, the exploration and research of some major literary issues have become seriously confused and erroneous. This is also evident and undeniable.

In what aspects have confusion and errors occurred?

Today, it is particularly worth reflecting on and learning from the fact that while some Western literary theories have been inappropriately elevated, Marxist-Leninist literary theory and Mao Zedong's literary thoughts have been doubted, belittled, and even denied in various ways. This is not an isolated or accidental situation. I believe this is related to the following prevalent views:

First, some people believe that Marxist-Leninist literary theory and Mao Zedong's literary thoughts are outdated, or that the classic form of Marxist literary theory is powerless, or that a pluralistic literary theory framework is no longer in line with the trend. Indeed, Marxist literary theory emerged in the 19th century, but its significance and influence are not limited to that time. It is not only applicable to the era of Marx and Engels. The basic principles of literature proposed by Marx and Engels, known as the classic form, not only laid a solid foundation for the further development of Marxist literary theory but also have significant methodological implications. They are applicable to understanding the essence and function of literature, the laws of literary creation, the standards of literary criticism, and the process of 20th-century literary development. They will not become outdated. Some Western bourgeois scholars also have to acknowledge this. For example, British professor Hugh Lloyd-Jones pointed out: "Not only in the fields of history, politics, economics, and sociology, but also in aesthetics and literary criticism, Marxism is a doctrine that every educated reader must deal with." American professor Cavanagh believes: "Marxism has shown its ability to comprehensively analyze literary themes, authors, and schools, integrating them into the overall theory of social significance. Currently, Marxist theory and criticism play a major role in academic literary research, and in literary research, Marxism is almost unparalleled. This is indeed a 'great irony of history.'" These views from the Western literary criticism circle are worth noting and heeding.

Marxist literary theory, as a school of 20th-century Western literary theory, has been widely disseminated and studied. This may be something that some people did not anticipate. For example, since the mid-1960s, Western editors have published dozens of selections of Marxist literary criticism. Although the research level of these Western works varies, and their views differ, many of which we cannot agree with, there is one common point: they all do not ignore that Marxist literary theory is a major phenomenon in 20th-century literary criticism that cannot be ignored.

For socialist China, Marxist literary theory cannot be just one of the literary theory schools, or just one element in a multi-element literary theory system. Our Constitution has established Marxism as the theoretical foundation of our guiding ideology. As a part of it, literary theory should first be the guiding ideology of our socialist literature. This is not the will of any individual but a choice of history. Because the basic principles of literature elucidated by the classic writers of Marxism based on dialectical and historical materialism are scientific summaries and generalizations of literary practice, they are objectively true and have been tested by history. Their historical innovativeness and methodological superiority are unparalleled by any past or present literary theory school. That is, Marxist-Leninist literary theory and Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, as the guiding ideology of our socialist literature, are historically determined.

Second, some people believe that Marx and Engels' literary theory lacks a complete system, consisting only of scattered, fragmentary opinions found here and there, with no monographs, and some are informal works such as letters, mainly collected, compiled, expounded, and developed by later generations.

Indeed, from a formal perspective, the systematic nature of Marx and Engels' literary views is not as strong as their philosophy and economics, which is a fact. However, their literary views are organically linked to their entire doctrine, a part of the "air they breathe." Whether from the perspective of historical innovation, rigor, scientificity, or methodology, they form a system and are a new system in the development of human literary studies. Moreover, all theoretical systems throughout history are not necessarily composed of a single form of magnum opus; their forms are often diverse. Additionally, there is the question of how to view the significance and achievements of Marxist literary theory. Otherwise, why have some statements repeatedly emphasized that it lacks a system over the years?

Third, some people believe that Marx and Engels' literary theory is economic determinism, externalism, object worship; Lenin's dialectical reflection theory is intuitive, mechanical, and a developed theory of representation and imitation; Mao Zedong's literary thoughts are political pragmatism, aesthetic loss, etc. This gives people the impression that Marxist-Leninist literary theory and Mao Zedong's literary thoughts are so simple, so crude, and so vulgar.

Here, I cannot discuss each of the above issues individually. Taking the so-called "economic determinism," for example, it is not the literary concept of Marx and Engels but the literary advocacy of those so-called "authorities" of Marxist literary studies, vulgar sociologists. Marx and Engels spoke of the economic base determining the superstructure, not the economy determining the superstructure. The economy and the economic base are not the same thing, which is one point. Secondly, Engels explicitly pointed out that art, like philosophy and religion, belongs to "higher consciousness that is farther away from the material economic base... Here, the connection between ideas and their material existence conditions becomes more confused and more blurred by some intermediate links. But this connection exists." He also said: "As for those thought domains that are more suspended in the air, such as religion, philosophy, etc., they all have their pre-historic content discovered and accepted by historical periods, that is, what we currently have to call erroneous content." Marx also said, "A certain period of prosperity in literature is by no means proportional to the general development of society, and therefore is by no means proportional to the general development of what is seemingly the skeletal structure of social organization, the material base." Marx and Engels' words not only elucidate the special position of literature in the superstructure and ideology, revealing the complex, indirect, and multi-layered connection between literature and the economic base, but also open up a broad path for us to explore literary issues. It is clear that the hat of "economic determinism" does not fit on the head of Marxist literary theory. Marxism has drawn a clear line with vulgar sociology.

How to uphold and develop Marxist literary theory

Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his National Day speech:

"In light of many new situations and new problems in the world and China, and in light of the heavy responsibilities our Party bears in the construction of Chinese socialism and the important position it holds in the international communist movement, it is necessary to make the study and research of Marxist basic theory, and the research and exploration of major contemporary political, economic, and social theory issues under the guidance of Marxism, an urgent task and bring it to the forefront of the entire Party." I believe this is also applicable to the literary field. Today's world literature is not only different from 19th-century literature and early 20th-century literature but also different from the literature of the decades after World War II. Indeed, many new situations and new problems have emerged, which are not something that the classic writers of Marxism have encountered. It is necessary to creatively research and explore these under the guidance of Marxist literary theory and to push Marxist literary theory forward.

First, we must study and research the basic principles of Marxist literary theory and, based on the foundation laid by the classic writers of Marxism, push it forward. Without their basic principles and the foundation they laid, there can be no true progress. For example, the proposition by Marx and Engels that literature is a part of the superstructure and ideology is a monumental contribution to human literary studies. However, some recent statements have not taken this seriously, claiming that literature is supra-superstructure and supra-ideology. Based on this view and direction, it is not only impossible to push Marxist literary theory forward but may even turn Marxist literary theory into something that is no longer Marxist literary theory. Without their basic principles and the foundation they laid, it is not only impossible to correctly understand and explain any complex contemporary literary issue but also impossible to recognize and evaluate contemporary "Western Marxism" or "New Marxism" literary theory. Contemporary "Western Marxism" or "New Marxism" literary theory is an extremely large and complex phenomenon, with numerous literary theory models and literary concepts, which we can no longer avoid. Whether in their works, which are Marxist and which are not Marxist, we can only make a factual analysis based on the basic spirit and basic principles of Marxist literary theory.

Second, we should continually absorb all positive, beneficial, and excellent elements from contemporary human literary studies and human culture, transform them, and make them suitable for the development needs of the Marxist literary theory system. In fact, the classic writers of Marxism have always done this in the historical process of creating and developing their literary theory system. Today, we should not interrupt this lively historical process. Lenin said: "In Marxism, there is absolutely nothing similar to 'sectarianism'; it is not a narrow and stubborn doctrine produced away from the great road of world civilization." He also said: "Proletarian culture should be the result of the necessary outcome of human development under the oppression of capitalist, landlord, and bureaucratic societies. All these big and small paths, whether past, present, or future, lead to proletarian culture..." Similarly, Marxist literary theory should also keep pace with human civilization. We should not reject and exclude the contemporary systems theory, information theory, control theory, and other products of human civilization. The issue is to use Marxism as a guide, based on the laws of art, to correctly, reasonably, and scientifically apply the new achievements of natural science and social science to Marxist literary theory. At the same time, we should see that there are indeed some meaningful and valuable things in 20th-century Western literary theory that Marxist literary theory has long neglected or not proposed.

Third, we should not forget that Marxism "is essentially critical and revolutionary." Marx said: "Dialectics does not worship anything; it is essentially critical and revolutionary." Lenin also wrote: "Marx considered the entire value of his theory to be that it 'is essentially critical and revolutionary.' This latter quality is truly and unconditionally inherent in Marxism..." The entire development history of Marxist literary theory, as a component of Marxism, shows that it was produced and developed in the collision and struggle with various idealist, mechanical materialist, positivist, and vulgar sociological literary theory trends. Today, we must continue to uphold the "critical and revolutionary" principle of Marxism, oppose bourgeois liberalization trends and various erroneous literary trends and literary theories; at the same time, we should also fully and correctly understand this "critical and revolutionary" principle. That is, we should, under new historical conditions, based on the "critical and revolutionary" principle, continually summarize various experiences in the process of socialist literary practice, continually examine and review Marxist literary theory itself, which components only have historical significance and no longer adapt to new situations; which components are not emphasized enough and should be enriched and perfected; which components are not mentioned and should be supplemented and developed.

Fourth, it must be recognized that it can only be achieved through the discussion and debate of different views and opinions. Historical experience has repeatedly shown that discussion and debate are the only path to truth. Truth becomes clearer with debate. In 1977, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We must adhere to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, allowing debate." However, over the years, due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization trends, the Party's "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy has not been seriously implemented, and some reasonable and well-founded articles have not been allowed to be published. This is an undeniable fact. How to take effective measures to promote and advance the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy may still be an issue on the literary agenda.

    认真学习和研究马克思主义文艺理论
    吴元迈
    这十年来，我们的文艺理论经过反思和拨乱反正，在克服教条主义、庸俗社会学、简单化等倾向方面取得了很大成绩，在介绍和引进20世纪国外各种文艺理论学派及其著作方面做了不少工作，在一些迫切的当代文艺理论问题方面迈开了步伐，这些都是有目共睹的，无可怀疑的。同时，这些年来，由于资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，由于忽视和轻视马克思列宁主义文艺理论、毛泽东文艺思想的学习和研究，一些重大文艺问题的探讨和研究出现了严重的混乱和失误，这也是有目共睹的，无可怀疑的。
  在哪些方面造成混乱和失误
    在今天，特别值得深思和引以为戒的是，在片面地、不恰当地抬高西方各种文艺理论学派成就的同时，以这种或那种方式怀疑、贬低、直至否定马克思列宁主义文艺理论、毛泽东文艺思想，并不是个别的、偶然的情况。之所以会发生这种情况，我以为同以下一些流行看法相关：
    第一，认为马克思列宁主义文艺理论、毛泽东文艺思想已经过时，或马克思主义文艺理论的经典形态已经无能为力，或一元多样的文艺理论格局已经不合潮流，等等。
    诚然，马克思主义文艺理论产生于19世纪，但其意义与影响是不能限制在时间范围之内的。它不只适用于马克思、恩格斯那个时代。马克思恩格斯所提出的文艺的基本原理即所谓的经典形态，不仅为马克思主义文艺理论的进一步发展奠定了坚实基础，而且具有重大的方法论意义，对于理解文艺的本质和功能、文艺创作的规律和文艺批评的标准，以及20世纪文艺发展的过程等，同样是适用的，决不会过时。对此，一些西方的资产阶级学者也是不能不予以承认的。例如，英国休·劳埃德—琼斯教授指出：“不仅在历史、政治、经济和社会各门学科中，而且在美学与文学批评领域中，马克思主义都是每个有学识的读者必须与之打交道的一种学说。”美国卡瓦纳教授认为：“马克思主义已经表明它具有对文学方面的主题、作者和流派进行综合分析，把它结合在社会意义形成的总的理论中去的能力。目前马克思主义理论和批评在学术性的文学研究方面具有重大作用，而且马克思主义在文学研究方面几乎很少人能与之匹敌，这确实是‘历史上的一大讽刺’”。来自西方文论界的这些看法，值得注意和重视。
    马克思主义文艺理论作为20世纪西方文艺理论的一个学派，得到了相当广泛的传播与研究。这也许是一些人所始料不及的。例如，60年代中期以来，西方编辑出版的马克思主义文论选有数十种。尽管这些西方著作的研究水平参差不齐，观点各异，其中不少观点是我们不能同意的，但有一点却是共同的，它们都没有忽视马克思主义文艺理论是20世纪文论中一个不能不与之打交道的重大现象。
    对于社会主义的我国来说，马克思主义文艺理论就不能像在西方那样，只是一个文艺理论学派，或者说，只是多元文艺理论体系格局中的一元。我国宪法已把马克思主义作为我们指导思想的理论基础。作为它的组成部分的文艺理论，首先应该是我国社会主义文艺的指导思想。这不是任何个人的意志，而是历史的选择。因为，马克思主义经典作家依据辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义所阐明的文艺的基本原理，是文艺实践的科学概括和总结，是经受了历史检验的客观真理，其历史创新性和方法论的优越性，是任何过去与现在的其他文艺理论学派所无法比拟的，也就是说马克思列宁主义文艺理论、毛泽东文艺思想作为我国社会主义文艺的指导思想，是历史地被决定的。
    第二，认为马克思恩格斯的文艺理论没有完整体系，只有一些零星的、散见各处的意见，并没有专著，有些则是非正式著作如书信等，主要是由后人搜集、整理、阐述、发挥、发展而成。
    的确从形式上看，马克思恩格斯的文艺观点的系统性不如他们的哲学和经济学，这是事实。但是，他们的文艺观点是同他们的全部学说有机地联系在一起的，是他们“呼吸的空气的一部分”，无论从历史的创新性、严密性、科学性、方法论看，都是自成体系的，而且是人类文艺学发展中的崭新体系。再说，古往今来的一切理论体系，并非都是由鸿篇巨制这一种形式构成，其形态往往是多种多样的。此外，还有一个如何看待马克思主义文艺理论的意义与成就的问题，不然，为什么这些年来一些言论要如此反复地强调它是没有体系的呢？
    第三，认为马克思、恩格斯的文艺理论是经济决定论、外在论、客体崇拜论；列宁的辩证反映论是直观论、机械论、发展了的再现说和模仿说；毛泽东文艺思想是政治实用论、审美失落论，等等。这就给人们造成一种印象，似乎马克思列宁主义文艺理论、毛泽东文艺思想是如此之简单，如此之粗糙，如此之庸俗。
    这里，我无法就上述问题逐个地加以讨论。拿所谓的“经济决定论”来说，它并不是马克思、恩格斯的文艺观念，而是那些被称为“马克思主义文艺学权威”的庸俗社会学者的文艺主张。马克思、恩格斯说的是经济基础决定上层建筑，而不是说经济决定上层建筑，经济与经济基础并不是一回事，这是其一。其二，恩格斯明确指出，艺术同哲学和宗教一样，是属于“更高的远离物质经济基础的意识形态……在这里，观念同自己的物质存在条件的联系，愈来愈混乱，愈来愈被一些中间环节弄模糊了。但是这一联系是存在着的。”（《马克思恩格斯选集》，下同）又说：“至于那些更高地悬浮于空中的思想领域，即宗教、哲学等等，那末它们都有它们的被历史时期所发现和接受的史前内容，即目前我们不免要称之为谬论的内容”。马克思也说，文艺的“一定的繁荣时期决不是同社会的一般发展成比例的，因而也决不是同仿佛是社会组织的骨骼的物质基础的一般发展成比例的。”马克思、恩格斯这些话不仅阐明了文艺在上层建筑、意识形态中的特殊地位，揭示了文艺与经济基础的复杂的、间接的、多层次的联系，也为我们打开了一条探求文艺问题的宽广道路。可见，“经济决定论”的帽子戴不到马克思主义文艺理论的头上。马克思主义同庸俗社会学是划清了界线的。
  如何坚持和发展
  马克思主义文艺理论
    不久前，江泽民同志在国庆讲话中指出：
  “鉴于世界和中国的许多新情况、新问题，鉴于我们党在中国社会主义建设中担负的重大责任和国际共产主义运动中所处的重要地位，有必要把学习和研究马克思主义基本理论，在马克思主义指导下研究和探讨当代重大的政治、经济、社会理论问题，作为一项紧迫任务，提到全党面前。”我想，这对于文艺领域也是适用的。当今的世界文艺不仅与19世纪的文艺、20世纪初的文艺不同，也与二次大战后那些年代的文艺不同，的确出现了许多新情况、新问题，这是马克思主义经典作家所没有碰到过的，既需要在马克思主义文艺理论的指导下，创造性地加以研究和探讨，也需要把马克思主义文艺理论向前推进。
    第一，必须学习和研究马克思主义文艺理论的基本原理，并在马克思主义经典作家所奠定的那个基础上把它向前推进。撇开他们的基本原理和他们所奠定的基础，是不可能有真正的推进的。例如，马克思、恩格斯提出的文艺是上层建筑、意识形态之一，这是他们对人类文艺学的一个划时代的重大贡献。而这些年来，有的言论则不以为然，声称文艺是超上层建筑的、超意识形态的。依据这种观点和方向，不仅不可能把马克思主义文艺理论向前推进，甚至有可能把马克思主义文艺理论变得不再是马克思主义文艺理论了。撇开他们的基本原理和他们所奠定的基础，这不仅对任何复杂的当代文艺问题得不到正确的理解和说明，也无法认识和评价当代“西方马克思主义”或“新马克思主义”的文艺理论。当代“西方马克思主义”或“新马克思主义”的文艺理论，是极其庞大、复杂的现象，有着众多的文艺理论模式和文艺观念，已是我们所不能回避的了。究竟在他们的论著中哪些是马克思主义的，哪些不是马克思主义的，我们只有从马克思主义文艺理论的基本精神和基本原理出发，方能作出实事求是的剖析。
    第二，应该不断地吸收当代人类文艺学和人类文化中一切积极的、有益的、优秀的成分，加以改造，使之适合于马克思主义文艺理论体系发展的需要。其实，马克思主义经典作家在创立和发展自己的文艺理论体系的历史行程中，从来就是这样做的。在今天，我们决不应该中断这一生动的历史行程。列宁说：“在马克思主义那里，绝没有与‘宗派主义’相似的东西，它绝不是离开世界文明大道而产生的偏狭顽固的学说。”（《列宁全集》第4卷第187页）又说：“无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会和官僚社会压迫下创造出来的合乎知识发展的必然结果。所有这些大大小小的途径，无论过去、现在或将来，都通向无产阶级文化”……同样，马克思主义文艺理论也应该和人类文明同步。对于当代的系统论、信息论、控制论等人类文明的产物，不应加以拒绝与排斥。问题是，应该以马克思主义为指导，依据艺术规律，正确地、合理地、科学地把自然科学和社会科学中的新成就，运用于马克思主义文艺理论。同时，应该看到20世纪西方的文艺理论中确有一些有意义、有价值的东西，是马克思主义文艺理论长期以来注意不够或未曾提出的。
    第三，不应当忘记马克思主义“在本质上是批判的和革命的”。马克思说：“辩证法不崇拜任何东西，按其本质来说是批判的和革命的。”列宁也写道：“马克思认为他的理论的全部价值在于这个理论‘在本质上是批判的和革命的’。后一品质真正是马克思主义完全地和无条件地所固有的……”作为马克思主义组成部分的它的文艺理论的全部发展史表明，它是在同形形色色的唯心主义、机械唯物主义、实证主义、庸俗社会学等文艺理论思潮的碰撞和斗争中产生和发展的。在今天，我们必须继续高扬马克思主义的“批判的和革命的”原则，反对资产阶级自由化思潮和各种错误的文艺思潮与文艺理论；同时，也应该全面地、正确地理解这一
  “批判的和革命的”原则。这就是说，应该在新的历史条件下，根据“批判的和革命的”原则，不断地总结社会主义文艺实践过程中的各种经验，不断地检验、审视马克思主义文艺理论自身，哪些成分只具有历史意义，不再适应新的情况；哪些成分强调得不够，应当加以丰富和完善；哪些成分没有提到，应当加以补充和发展。
    第四，必须认识到只有通过不同观点和意见的讨论和争鸣来实现。历史的经验一再表明，讨论和争鸣是通向真理的唯一途径。真理只能愈辩愈明。1977年，邓小平同志指出：“我们要坚持百家争鸣的方针，允许争论”。然而这些年来，由于资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，党的“双百”方针并没有得到认真的贯彻执行，一些言之有理、持之有故的文章并没有被允许刊载发表，这已经是不可否认的事实。如何采取有效的措施来推动和促进“双百”方针的实现，也许仍然是文艺议事日程上的一个问题。
