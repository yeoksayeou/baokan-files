Recently, the judicial authorities in Brazil uncovered a striking case of fake importation and currency speculation, involving over 30 enterprises and transportation companies, 15 domestic banks, 6 brokerage exchanges, 5 foreign banks, and a large number of financial and tax officials. The amount involved in this case is at least $360 million, with $150 million already traced.

According to the investigation, the criminal group used fictitious company names to forge import documents, deceiving the Brazilian Foreign Trade Bureau into issuing import permits. They then used bribery and other means to obtain various approvals, and through banks, exchanged the national currency for foreign exchange at the official rate from the central bank. Under the pretense of purchasing imported raw materials, they transferred the money abroad.

In reality, these funds were not used to purchase imported goods but were pocketed by individuals. A significant portion of the foreign exchange was then channeled back into Brazil through the black market, exchanged for Brazilian currency in the free market, and thus reaped huge profits.

It is reported that the departments and individuals involved in the case are numerous, including some sea and land transportation companies. It is said that so far, nearly 600 fake import applications have been discovered.

    令人触目的套汇案
    本报记者　兰才基
    巴西司法部门最近揭露出一桩令人触目的假进口真套汇舞弊案，涉案者包括30多家企业和运输公司、15家本国银行、6家仲介交易所、5家外资银行，以及一大批国家财政、税务官员。涉及此案的金额至少达3.6亿美元，目前已查出了1.5亿美元的下落。
    据揭露，作案集团是以虚设的公司名义伪造进口物资申请文件，向巴西银行外贸局骗取进口许可证，并用贿赂等手段办理各种审批手续，然后通过银行用本国货币向中央银行按官价换取外汇，以购买进口原材料为名把钱汇出国外。
    但事实上这一笔笔汇款根本没有用来购买进口物资，而是落入了私人腰包。其中一大部分外汇又通过黑市渠道流回巴西，在自由市场上换成巴西货币，从中牟取暴利。
    据透露，涉案的部门和人员众多，甚至包括一些海运和陆运公司在内。据说，到目前为止，已查出近600份假进口申请书。
