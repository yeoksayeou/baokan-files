Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 11th — During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the 40 grain production base counties in Henan Province have, after three years of construction, taken shape and shown significant results. They have become important bases for Henan's stable grain production and for supplying commercial grain to the state. Over the past three years compared to the previous three years, these counties have cumulatively increased grain production by 4.48 billion kilograms, with an average annual growth rate of 13 percent. They have cumulatively provided 9.02 billion kilograms of commercial grain to the state, accounting for about half of the total commercial grain supplied by the province to the state, with wheat alone accounting for more than 60 percent.
