Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 9th - Representatives attending the second annual meeting of the National Health System Political Work Research Association in Chengdu proposed that strengthening and improving ideological and political work is an urgent task for the health sector.

Representatives at the meeting pointed out that taking Comrade White as an example, saving lives and helping the injured, understanding the urgency of patients, thinking about what patients need, and serving the people wholeheartedly have always been good traditions and good practices on China's health front. However, in recent years, due to various factors, medical ethics and practices have shown a "slippery slope": some are indifferent to patients; some prioritize economic income, prescribing large treatments for minor illnesses; some consciously or unconsciously accept money and gifts from patients; some use medicine for personal gain.

The representatives suggested that to address the problem of declining medical ethics and practices, the urgent task is to strengthen and improve the Party's ideological and political work. They proposed to rationalize the relationship between the Party and the government in the health sector, fully mobilize and give play to the initiatives of both, so that the Party organization can truly play the role of guarantee, supervision, and "battle fortress." They advocated for taking Comrade White as an example, adopting various forms of continuous education for staff on the "four-haves" and professional ethics, and turning the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly into a conscious action. They also proposed to establish and improve various rules and regulations, carry out multi-level and multi-channel mass supervision activities, and boldly commend the advanced, urge the backward, and punish those who shirk their duties and use medicine for personal gain.

    全国卫生系统政工研究会强调
    改进政治工作　治理不正医风
    新华社成都12月9日电（记者贺灿永）正在成都参加全国卫生系统思想政治工作研究会第二届年会的代表提出：加强和改进思想政治工作是卫生部门的当务之急。
    参加这次年会的代表们指出，以白求恩同志为榜样，救死扶伤，急病人所急，想病人所想，全心全意为人民服务，向来是我国卫生战线的好传统、好作风。可是，近几年由于多种因素，医德医风出现了“滑坡”现象：有的对病人漠不关心；有的经济收入至上，小病开大处方；有的自觉地或不自觉地接受病员的钱物；有的以医药谋私。
  与会代表提出，要解决医德医风“滑坡”问题，当务之急是加强和改进党的思想政治工作。他们建议，应理顺卫生部门的党政关系，充分调动和发挥两个积极性，使党组织真正起到保证、监督和“战斗堡垒”的作用。要坚持以白求恩同志为榜样，采取多种形式不间断地对职工进行“四有”教育和职业道德教育，把全心全意为人民服务变成自觉行动。要建立、健全各项规章制度，开展多层次多渠道的群众性监督活动，理直气壮地表彰先进，鞭策后进，惩治玩忽职守和以医药谋私者。
