Since this year, the People's Bank of China's provincial branches, in collaboration with various specialized banks, have conducted a comprehensive debt recovery campaign, achieving initial success and exploring several effective methods:

1. **Organizing Surveys and Classifying Debts:**
   For example, the Shandong branch organized specialized banks to conduct a thorough investigation of the debt situations within their systems, including who owes whom and the amount of overdue bills. They then classified and prioritized these debts according to national industrial policies, recording each case in detail. This laid a solid foundation for the comprehensive debt recovery work.

2. **Implementing a Balanced Approach to Ensure Key Areas:**
   For instance, the Tianjin branch, in accordance with national industrial and credit policies, collaborated with financial and enterprise management departments to classify the inventory of over 2,000 commercial enterprises. They established a sequence for prioritizing, conditionally supporting, restricting loans, and not providing loans. They then focused on clearing debts for enterprises that met the loan conditions and were prioritized for support.

3. **Clearing One Point to Resolve a Series:**
   For example, the Sichuan South Chongqing Silk Mill owed a significant amount of money to various silk factories and cocoon stations within the region. The South Chongqing branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank issued 83 million yuan in special funds to clear these debts, which allowed the silk factories and cocoon stations to repay their bank loans.

4. **Layered Debt Recovery:**
   The Liaoning branch divided debt recovery into four layers: First, debts within the system of each city's specialized banks, handled by the respective city's specialized banks. Second, cross-system debts within a city, organized by the city's debt recovery leadership group involving all specialized banks. Third, cross-city debts within the system of specialized banks, organized by the provincial specialized banks under equal conditions. Fourth, cross-system debts between cities, led by the provincial debt recovery leadership group, with relevant banks collaborating to clear these debts.

5. **Concentrating Resources to Clear Debts in Key Industries:**
   This method is particularly suitable for industries with integrated production, supply, and sales.

6. **Clearing Debts Between Banks:**
   The Jiangxi branch implemented a system where the provincial debt recovery leadership group set uniform exchange times and deadlines. All banks submitted their overdue interbank drafts to the draft exchange center for equal settlement. Any remaining differences were adjusted within the system of specialized banks, with banks lending to each other, and the People's Bank of China handling short-term loans to resolve these issues.

    几种行之有效的清欠方法
    今年以来人民银行各省分行会同各专业银行普遍开展了清理拖欠的工作，取得初步成效，摸索出几种行之有效的“清欠”方法：
    （一）组织摸底，分类排队。如山东分行，组织专业银行对本系统开户企业的人欠、欠人情况和自身压票数额进行全面清查，然后按国家产业政策的要求进行分类排队，逐户登记造册，对应清的拖欠货款，也按轻重缓急排队。为全面清理工作打下了良好基础。
    （二）贯彻有保有压方针，确保重点。如天津分行，按照国家的产业政策和信贷政策，会同财政及企业主管部门对两千多个工商企业的库存商品进行了分类排队，制定了优先支持、适当支持、限制贷款、不予贷款的保压顺序，并对符合贷款条件的优先支持的企业拖欠进行了清理。
    （三）清理一点，解决一串。如四川南充绢纺厂拖欠地区内各丝绸厂和茧站大量货款，南充地区工商银行对该厂发放八百三十万元清欠专款，用以清偿该厂拖欠区内七个丝绸厂和七个茧站的货款。这些丝绸厂和茧站收到货款后，相应归还了银行贷款。
    （四）分层次清理。辽宁分行把清欠分为四个层次：第一，各市专业银行系统内的拖欠，由各市专业银行负责组织清理。第二，各市范围内跨系统间的拖欠，由各市清欠领导小组组织各专业银行共同清理。第三，跨市的专业银行系统内的拖欠，由省专业银行按对等条件负责组织清理。第四，各市间跨系统的拖欠，由省清欠领导小组统一领导，组织有关行共同配合清理。
    （五）集中各方面力量，对某些重点行业集中清理。这种方法尤其适用于产供销一体的行业。
    （六）清理银行之间的资金拖欠。江西分行采取由省清欠领导小组规定统一的交换时间和截止时间，各行将所有应提未提的同城交换票据提交票据交换所，进行等额清算，其差额部分由各专业银行系统内调剂，银行之间相互拆借，由人民银行代办短期拆借解决。（《金融时报》）
