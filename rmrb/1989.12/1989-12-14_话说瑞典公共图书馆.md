The most frequented places by Swedes are not cafes or cinemas, but libraries. Swedes love to read, and this is renowned worldwide.

This country, with a population of just over 8.5 million, has more than 2,200 public libraries aside from those in schools, companies, and government agencies. Whether you are on a small island with a few hundred residents or in a remote village in the Arctic region, you can find a public library. Additionally, there are 125 mobile book vans. Statistics show that on average, each Swede borrows 9 books from public libraries per year, a figure that is rare in the world. This number does not include those who go to libraries to read newspapers and magazines.

Sweden's emphasis on library construction has historical roots. As early as the 1930s, the Swedish labor movement proposed the slogan: "Let books occupy a more important position in people's lives," mobilizing workers to improve their cultural literacy and create conditions for democracy and equality. The Swedish Parliament legislated that public libraries are tools for implementing popular education policies and should strive to encourage people to seek knowledge and improve their cultural literacy.

Public libraries here not only have extensive collections but also convenient borrowing procedures and warm, considerate services. A library serving over 10,000 residents can have as many as 200,000 books, plus over 500 types of newspapers and magazines, and 2,000 sets of audio novels. If the book you need is not on the shelf, you can leave the title with the librarian. Library staff will use computers to contact other libraries to retrieve the book for you as soon as possible. Someone once registered to borrow a classic Chinese novel, and to their surprise, they received a call three days later to pick it up. Thanks to the establishment of a national book computer network, you can almost always get the books and periodicals you need at any public library. If you need to look up an article from a newspaper 20 years ago, the library can provide you with a copy through a computer connection with the national library.

In Sweden, as long as you have an ID, you can go to any public library to get a library card. There is no limit to the number of books you can borrow each time, and it is free. The borrowing period is three weeks. If you want to renew, you just need to go to the library or make a phone call; otherwise, you will be fined for overdue days.

Each public library here has a quiet environment, bright lighting, and appropriate layout, providing a comfortable feeling. Library staff not only handle borrowing and returning procedures but also provide various services for readers. For example, they provide information on local cultural activities, help look up materials, free copying of articles from newspapers and magazines, and answer questions about government tax policies. If you get tired from reading, you can put on headphones and ask the staff to play some music you like. To allow parents with children to read in peace, the library prepares intellectual toys and story audio tapes for children, so that adults and children can both enjoy themselves. The library considers providing services for the disabled and the sick as an important task. As long as there is a request, they will deliver books to your door for free. The library specially prepares braille books and audio books. If a patient wants to appreciate some famous paintings, the library can send replicas or albums to the bedside. To facilitate workers borrowing books, mobile book vans regularly go to docks and mines. The book vans also often go to prisons to deliver books to inmates.

To attract more readers to the library, in addition to meeting the readers' needs for reading, the staff also arrange for authors to meet readers, hold works appreciation and discussion meetings, poetry recitation meetings, amateur creation competitions, and art exhibitions to enhance people's interest in books and art. In some rural areas and small towns, public libraries have become the most ideal places for people to adjust their spirits and seek cultural life.

    话说瑞典公共图书馆
    本报记者　顾耀铭
    瑞典人最常去的地方不是咖啡馆，也不是影剧院，而是图书馆。瑞典人爱看书，这在世界上是出了名的。
    这个国家人口仅850多万，除学校、公司、机关的图书馆外，公共图书馆就有2200个，不管你在居民只有数百人的小岛，还是北极区偏僻的乡村，都可以找到公共图书馆。此外，还有125辆流动图书车。据统计，瑞典平均每人每年向公共图书馆借9本书，在世界上是少有的。这个数字还不包括去图书馆看书报的人。
    瑞典重视图书馆建设是有历史传统的。早在30年代，瑞典工人运动就提出口号：“让书本在人们生活中占据更重要的位置”，动员工人提高文化修养，为争取民主和平等创造条件。瑞典议会立法规定，公共图书馆是普及教育政策的实施工具，应当致力于鼓励人们寻求知识和提高文化修养。
    这里的公共图书馆不仅藏书量大，而且借阅方便，服务热情周到。一个为1万多名居民服务的图书馆，藏书竟多达20万册，此外，还有500多种报纸、杂志，2000多套小说录音带。你需要的书如果在书架上找不到，可以把书名留下。图书馆工作人员通过电脑同其他图书馆联系，尽快把书调来。有人曾试着登记借阅一本中文古典小说，没想到三天后接到电话让他去取。由于建立了全国图书电脑联系网，你在任何一家公共图书馆几乎都可以得到所需要的书刊。你如果需要查阅20年前一份报纸的文章，图书馆可以通过电脑与国家图书馆书库联系，给你提供复印件。
    在瑞典，只要你有身份证就可以到任何一家公共图书馆去办理借书证。每次借书量不限，而且免费。每次借书期三个星期，到期你想续借，只需去图书馆或打个电话说一下，否则要按超期天数交罚金。
    这里每一个公共图书馆环境幽静，灯光明亮，布置得当，与人以舒适感。图书馆工作人员不仅负责借还手续，还为读者提供各种服务。如提供当地文化活动的信息，帮助查阅资料，免费为读者复印报刊上的文章，解答有关政府税收政策等方面的问题。如果你看书累了，可以戴上耳机，请工作人员放一段你喜爱的音乐。为了让带孩子的家长安心看书，图书馆为孩子准备了智力玩具和故事录音带，使大人、孩子各得其所。图书馆把为残疾人和病人提供服务作为一项重要任务。只要有要求，他们就免费送书上门。图书馆专门备有盲文书刊和录音书籍。如果病人想欣赏一些名画，图书馆可以将复制品或画册送到床头。为了方便工人借书，流动图书车定期开到码头、矿井。图书车还经常去监狱，给犯人送书。
    为吸引更多的读者到图书馆来，工作人员除了满足读者看书的需要外，还安排作家与读者见面，举办作品欣赏讨论会、诗歌朗诵会、业余创作竞赛、美术作品展览等，以提高人们对书本和艺术的情趣。在一些乡村和小镇，公共图书馆成了人们调剂精神、寻求文化生活最理想的场所。（附图片）
