The China Quality Management Association's User Committee recently released the evaluation results of product quality and service quality for 26 key steel enterprises nationwide. Among them, the satisfaction rating for Tianjin Metallurgical Bureau was the lowest (see the second page of our newspaper on November 22). After seeing this news, the Party Committee of Tianjin Metallurgical Bureau immediately convened an expanded meeting to specifically study how to improve quality work, deciding that the Party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues would jointly manage and seriously address quality issues.

The measures taken by Tianjin Metallurgical Bureau include:

1. From the bureau, companies, to factories, workshops, and teams, the standards and measures for improving product quality are specified, and quality management is included as a key part of the current rectification and reorganization work.
2. Learning from advanced units such as Wuhan Steel, the bureau leadership organizes professional departments and enterprises to specifically analyze quality issues, strengthen management, and ensure quality.
3. Further strengthening quality inspections and technical supervision, solving technical difficulties in the production process, and ensuring the quality of steel components and final products.
4. Given the dispersed production situation in Tianjin's steelmaking, slabbing, rolling, and processing industries, strictly implementing the product flow card system, with each level ensuring that unqualified products do not flow from upstream factories to downstream factories.
5. In the near future, organizing enterprises to visit users, listening to criticisms, and seriously addressing and properly handling quality disputes.

    把用户的批评变成动力
    天津冶金局全力抓质量
    本报讯　中国质量管理协会用户委员会不久前公布了全国26家重点钢铁企业产品质量和服务质量用户评价结果，其中，对天津冶金局的满意度打分最低（见本报11月22日二版）。看到这一消息后，天津冶金局党委立即召开扩大会议，专题研究如何抓好质量工作，决定党政工团齐抓共管，认真解决质量问题。
    天津市冶金局采取的措施有：一、从局、公司到厂、车间、班组，把提高产品质量的标准和措施具体化，把质量管理纳入当前治理整顿工作的重点；二、学习武钢等先进单位的好经验，局领导组织专业部门和企业具体分析质量问题，加强管理，保证质量；三、进一步加强质量检查和技术监督，解决生产工艺中的技术难题，确保炼钢成分和最终产品质量；四、针对天津炼钢、开坯、轧钢和制品行业生产比较分散的状况，严格落实产品流动卡制度，层层把关，不让不合格产品从上工序厂流入下工序厂；五、近期内，组织企业进行用户访问，听取批评意见，认真对待和妥善处理质量异议。
