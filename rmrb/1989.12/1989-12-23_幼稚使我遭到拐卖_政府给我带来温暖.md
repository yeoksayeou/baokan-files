I am a 19-year-old girl from a rural area. On November 23, 1987, I was selling vegetables in the market when a fellow villager, Wang, invited me to see the peonies in Heze, Shandong Province. He described the place so beautifully that I eagerly agreed to go. Unfortunately, Wang tricked me and took me to Wangji Village in Shaozhuang Township, Cao County, Shandong Province, where he sold me to Du. I resisted fiercely but was brutally beaten. Unable to endure the inhumane torture, I tried to escape several times but was always caught and brought back by Du's family. To prevent me from escaping, they injured my leg and forbade me from contacting anyone or writing letters to my family. Several months later, I finally managed to send a letter to my family. When Du's family found out, they took the letter back from the post office and tore it to pieces in front of me, then beat me until I lost consciousness. After that, Du's family kept an even closer watch on me.

A girl from a neighboring family felt sorry for me and sent a letter to my family from an outside post office. My father received the letter and sent my uncle, brother, and maternal uncle to the Shaozhuang Township police station in Cao County. Liu Fucai, the station chief, who was having lunch, immediately stopped eating and sent someone to verify the situation. The next morning, Liu rushed to Du's house and sternly criticized Du's illegal actions. Seeing my family after so many days, I was overwhelmed with joy and sorrow, and I burst into tears in their arms. Then, Liu instructed the staff to buy train tickets and arranged for a car from the township government to take us to the train station. My family tried to give Liu 200 yuan as a token of gratitude, but Liu refused. From the bottom of my heart, I thank this good station chief who stands up for women.

After returning home, although my relatives and friends took good care of me, the scars on my heart are hard to heal. I hope that the person who took advantage of a young girl's naivety and engaged in the illegal act of trafficking women will be brought to justice.

    幼稚使我遭到拐卖  政府给我带来温暖
    我是一名19岁的农村姑娘。1987年11月23日上午，我正在集镇卖菜，同乡农民王某邀我去山东省菏泽市看牡丹。他把那里的情况描绘得天花乱坠，我向往外出见见世面，就欣然答应。谁知，王某把我骗到山东曹县邵庄乡王集村，把我卖给了杜某。我极力反抗，却惨遭毒打。我不堪忍受非人的折磨，几次逃跑都被杜家人抓回。为了防止我逃跑，他们砸伤了我的腿，并不许我同别人接触，不许我给亲人写信。几个月后，我才设法给家人发了一封信。杜家人得知后，硬是从邮局把信要回来，当着我的面把我写的信撕得粉碎，然后对我又是一顿毒打，直到把我打昏过去。这以后，杜家人更严密地看管我。
    一位邻居家的姑娘很同情我，她到外地邮局给我家里发了封求救信。我父亲收到信后，派舅舅、哥哥、姨父3人赶到曹县邵庄乡派出所。正在吃午饭的刘付财所长知道我亲人的来意后，马上放下碗筷，立即派人核实情况。第二天一早，刘所长抢先赶到杜家，严肃地批评了杜某的违法行为。看到多日不见的亲人，我悲喜万分，扑到亲人的怀里痛哭不已。接着刘所长又吩嘱工作人员去买火车票，到乡政府要车把我们送到火车站。我家人为谢恩人，将200元钱塞给刘所长，被刘所长拒绝了。我从心里感谢这位一心为民女做主的好所长。
    回到家后，尽管亲朋好友对我关怀备至，但我心灵深处的伤痕难以愈合。我希望那个利用年轻姑娘幼稚的弱点，干着拐卖妇女违法勾当的人应受到法律追究。陕西临潼县　一受害姑娘口述
