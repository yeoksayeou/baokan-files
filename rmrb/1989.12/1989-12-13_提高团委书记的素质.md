I once conducted a survey, and found that among the secretaries of the Communist Youth League committees at various levels in local areas, there are indeed many who are enthusiastic and capable of handling the work of the League. However, there are also many who are merely nominal, mediocre, or even incompetent. I believe that one of the important reasons why the work of the Communist Youth League does not progress in some places is that the quality of the secretaries of the League committees is not high. Moreover, the low quality of the secretaries of the League committees is due to the lack of attention from party and government leaders in the selection and use of League cadres.

In terms of selection, principles are not followed. The selection of secretaries of the League committees is generally done by "talent scouts" who "evaluate" them. Some select the secretary of a factory director to take over; others select cultivating objects from leading organs to fill the position.

In terms of use, they do not focus on the job. They do not pay attention to the role of the entire organization of the Communist Youth League, but rather regard the secretary of the League committee as a "panacea." They use the secretary of a level of the League committee as a supporting actor to "run errands." As for how the secretary of the League committee can lead and organize the young people of a place to carry out activities and play an assistant role, few people consider this.

In terms of evaluation, they do not look at actual performance. At present, many party and government leaders do not evaluate from the perspective of the tasks of the Communist Youth League. The standard of evaluation is not on performance but on appearance. As long as the party and government leaders can call them and they are obedient, they are considered to have ability and potential and are favored. I think that as representatives of advanced youth—the secretaries of the League committees—the primary task is to focus on the party's central work and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young League members. Those who deviate from this fundamental point and do not focus on their work should not be tolerated. Below, I would like to discuss the "art of governance" of the secretaries of the League committees from four aspects:

They should dare to take on urgent, difficult, and new tasks, such as the arrangement of unemployed youth, juvenile delinquency, student strikes, and demonstrations, and strive to achieve results to gain the attention of party and government leaders.

They should make the life of the League rich and colorful, and the secretary of the League committee should unite the young League members closely around themselves, forming a strong cohesive force.

They should keep the organization of the League forever young, constantly injecting fresh blood.

They should care about and cultivate League cadres. At present, many League cadres think that being a secretary of the League committee means "no position and no power." When it comes to job title evaluation, recruitment of cadres, and salary promotion, few people consider them. They should be cared for in their lives and work. They should also select talented people who can speak, write, love the arts, understand management, and are strong in organization into the League committee team. Through cultivation, they should be sent to relevant units at any time.

### 提高团委书记的素质

    提高团委书记的素质
    我曾作过一番调查，在地方各级团委书记中，能热心而又胜任团的工作者固然不乏其人，然而徒有虚名，平庸甚至低能的也大有人在。我认为，有的地方共青团工作开展不起来的重要原因之一，就是团委书记的素质不高，而团委书记素质不高，又是党政领导对团干部配备、使用重视不够而造成的。
    在配备上不讲原则，对团委书记的选拔，一般都是由“伯乐”去“相”的，有的选厂长的秘书去接替；还有的选领导机关的培养对象去充当。
    在使用上不务正业，不注重发挥共青团整个组织的作用，而是把团委书记看作“万金油”。把一级团委书记当作跑龙套的配角去“打杂”，至于如何由团委书记牵头，组织一个地方的团员青年来开展活动，发挥助手作用则很少有人考虑。
    在考核上不看实绩。目前，许多单位的党政领导不从共青团的工作任务出发，考核的标准不是重在表现，而是重在表面，只要党政领导平常喊得动、听使唤，就算是有能耐、有潜力而备受青睐。我想，作为先进青年的代表——团委书记，首要任务就是围绕党的中心工作，充分调动广大团员青年的积极性，谁离开了这个根本点，让他“不务正业”是不应该的。下面，我想从四个方面具体谈一谈团委书记的“施政术”：
    要敢于承担急、难、新的任务，如待业青年安排、青少年犯罪、学生罢课游行等，并努力做出成绩，以取得党政领导重视。
    要使团的生活丰富多采，团委书记要把团员青年紧紧地团结在自己周围，形成一股强大的凝聚力。
    要使团的组织永远年轻，不断增添新鲜血液。
    要关心培养团干部。现在不少团干部认为，当团委书记“一无地位、二无权”，评定职称，招聘干部，晋升工资，很少有人考虑到他们。要从生活上、工作上体贴他们。还要把能演讲、会写作、喜文艺、懂管理、强于组织的人才选进团委班子。通过培养，随时向有关单位输送。　湖南平江县金龙区委　邱国庆
