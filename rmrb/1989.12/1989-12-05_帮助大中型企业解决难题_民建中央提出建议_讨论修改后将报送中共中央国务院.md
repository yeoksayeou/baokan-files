Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 4th.

A document titled "Suggestions on Solving Several Current Problems of State-Owned Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises" has sparked heated discussions among representatives at the ongoing Fifth Plenary Session of the Second National Congress of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK).

This document, drafted under the leadership of the RCCK Central Committee and reflecting the efforts of 50,000 RCCK members, will be revised and submitted to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council after the plenary session.

RCCK Central Committee Chairman Sun Qimeng said that the RCCK's suggestions aim to help large and medium-sized enterprises address various difficulties they face during the rectification and deepening of reforms, to enhance their vitality, and to play a leading role in the national economy.

Sun Qimeng introduced that, after a six-month investigation by the RCCK Central Committee and local organizations, it was found that state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are currently in a very difficult situation. Solving the problems of large and medium-sized enterprises during the rectification and deepening of reforms is an important step in implementing the policies decided by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It is also a strategic task of fundamental importance for achieving long-term, stable, and coordinated development of China's economy.

The more than 4,000-character document addresses the current problems of large and medium-sized enterprises and proposes strengthening the comprehensive balance and planned management of energy and raw materials to ensure priority supply to these enterprises. For example, the state should increase the proportion of planned supply to large and medium-sized enterprises, reduce intermediate links in material supply, and adopt necessary administrative, economic, and legal measures to inspect and supervise the implementation of mandatory plans. It also suggests strict management of the import and export of energy and raw materials, gradually rationalizing the prices of production materials, and promoting the comprehensive utilization of energy and raw materials.

The document also suggests adjusting credit policies to alleviate the current financial difficulties of large and medium-sized enterprises, appropriately adjusting fiscal and tax policies to gradually standardize the tax system, and creating an environment of equal competition for large, medium, and small enterprises. It also proposes further improving the enterprise contract responsibility system.

During the discussion, representatives from various regions proposed many revisions and supplementary opinions for the suggestions.
