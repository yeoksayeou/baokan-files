	Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: U.S. President's Special Envoy's Visit to China is Beneficial

	Beijing, December 14 (Xinhua) — Reporter He Chongyuan: Today in the afternoon, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Jin Guihua, responded to reporters' questions regarding Sino-American relations at a press conference. He said, "China appreciates President Bush's decision to send Special Envoy General Scowcroft to visit China. The Chinese government attaches great importance to Sino-American relations."

	Jin Guihua said, both China and the United States believe that General Scowcroft's visit to China is positive, constructive, and beneficial. It has enhanced mutual understanding between the two countries, helped to overcome difficulties in Sino-American relations, and is conducive to the gradual restoration and development of Sino-American relations.

	The spokesperson pointed out that in the current international situation, which is undergoing the most profound changes since the end of World War II, it is necessary for the two sides to exchange views frequently. General Scowcroft briefed the Chinese side on the situation of the Malta summit between the U.S. and Soviet leaders, and had extensive and in-depth discussions with Chinese leaders on the international situation and bilateral relations. The atmosphere was friendly and sincere. The exchange of views showed that there are still some differences between the two sides. However, both sides believe that there are significant common interests in a wide range of areas. The improvement and development of Sino-American relations are of great importance for maintaining world peace and stability.

	Jin Guihua also emphasized that the Chinese government believes that as long as both sides make joint efforts, strictly adhere to the principles of peaceful coexistence and the three joint communiqués between China and the United States, and do more practical work to improve Sino-American relations, it is entirely possible to maintain their respective positions, safeguard common interests, overcome current difficulties, restore normal Sino-American relations, and continue to develop them.

	In response to the question of whether the United States will deliver 3 communication satellites to China, the spokesperson said, the two sides had previously reached an agreement on China providing satellite launch services. This is a new area of cooperation between China and the United States. If the United States agrees to issue an export license for the communication satellites, it will help the cooperation to proceed smoothly. China welcomes this.

    外交部发言人指出
    美总统特使访华是有益的
    本报北京12月14日讯　记者何崇元报道：我国外交部发言人金桂华今天下午在新闻发布会上回答记者有关中美关系的提问时说：“中国对布什总统派特使斯考克罗夫特将军访华，表示赞赏。中国政府十分重视中美关系。”
    金桂华说，中美双方认为，斯考克罗夫特将军访华是积极的、建设性的和有益的。它增进了中美之间的相互了解，有助于克服中美关系中的困难，有利于中美关系的逐步恢复和发展。
    这位发言人指出，在当前国际局势正发生战后最深刻变化的形势下，中美双方经常交换意见是必要的。斯考克罗夫特将军向中方通报了美苏首脑马耳他会晤的情况，并且同中国领导人就国际形势和中美双边关系问题广泛深入地交换了意见，气氛是友好、坦诚的。交换意见的结果表明：双方仍然存在一些分歧。但是，双方都认为，中美在广泛的领域里存在重大的共同利益。中美关系的改善和发展对维护世界和平与稳定具有重要意义。
    金桂华还强调，中国政府认为，只要双方共同努力，严格遵守和平共处五项原则和中美之间的三个联合公报的原则，为改善中美关系多做实事，中美完全可以做到既保持各自的立场，又维护双方的共同利益，克服目前的困难，使中美关系恢复正常，继续发展。
    在回答美国是否将向中国运送3枚通讯卫星的问题时，这位发言人说，中美双方曾经就中国提供卫星发射服务达成过协议。这是中美两国一个新的合作领域。如果美国同意给通讯卫星发放出口许可证，将有助于合作的顺利进行。对此中方表示欢迎。
