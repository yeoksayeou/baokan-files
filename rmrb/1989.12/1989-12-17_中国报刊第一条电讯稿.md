The first Chinese newspaper to use telegraphic news articles was the *Shenbao*, which was founded in Shanghai in 1872. Under the supervision of British individuals such as Mei Cha, the *Shenbao* placed great emphasis on the collection and writing of news articles due to competitive pressures. In July 1881, the Qing government began constructing a large-scale telegraph line between Tianjin and Shanghai, known as the "South-North China Telegraph Trunk Line."

On January 16, 1882, the *Shenbao* published the first telegraphic news article sent by its correspondent in Tianjin two days earlier. The content was about the punishment of Zhang Chengyi, the Acting Governor of Yunnan, who was stripped of his official hat for failing to pay copper coins. The entire news article quoted the imperial edict regarding this punishment, marking the beginning of using telegraphs to transmit news domestically in China. On the same day, the *Shenbao* also published an editorial note: "(January 14) At 11 o'clock, the local telegraph office delivered a letter from a friend in Tianjin, which included a copy of an imperial edict. Since the newspaper had already been typeset and printed, it was not included. Now, it is respectfully reprinted as follows." Additionally, there was an announcement detailing the process of using telegraphs to transmit news.

    中国报刊第一条电讯稿
    我国第一家采用电讯稿的报刊是1872年在上海创刊的《申报》。当时《申报》在英国人美查等的主持下，出于竞争的需要，非常重视新闻稿件的采写。1881年7月，清政府在天津与上海之间开始架设大规模的电报线路——“南北洋电报干线”。
    1882年1月16日，《申报》刊出了该报驻天津访员（记者）两天前发来的第一条电讯稿，内容是清朝皇帝光绪给欠解铜款的云南按察使衔候补道台张承颐以“摘去顶戴”的处分。消息全文摘录了有关这一处分的“上谕”，是为我国利用电报在国内传递新闻的开始。《申报》在这一天还同时发表了编者的“按语”：“（一月十四日）十一点钟，本埠电报局送到津友来信，内有恭录上谕一道，因本馆新闻已排定发印，未及照登。兹用敬谨照录如左。”另有“告白”一篇，详细介绍了该报利用电报传递新闻的经过。
