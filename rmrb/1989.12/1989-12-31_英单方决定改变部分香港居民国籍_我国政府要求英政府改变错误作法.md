The British Government Unilaterally Decides to Change the Nationality of Some Hong Kong Residents
China's Government Demands the British Government Change Its Erroneous Approach

New China News Agency, December 30, Beijing - The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today regarding the British government's decision to change the nationality of some Hong Kong residents. The full text is as follows:

On December 20, the British government unilaterally announced its decision to grant full British citizenship, including the right to reside in the United Kingdom, to 50,000 households (totaling 225,000 people) of Hong Kong residents. The Chinese government is greatly surprised by this action of the British government.

The British government's approach seriously violates its own solemn commitments. Five years ago, during the negotiations on the Hong Kong issue, the nationality issue of relevant Hong Kong residents had already been agreed upon, and both sides exchanged memorandums on this basis. The British memorandum clearly stipulates: "Those who, under the laws of the United Kingdom in force in Hong Kong, are British Dependent Territories citizens by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong as of June 30, 1997, shall, from July 1, 1997, cease to be British Dependent Territories citizens, but shall be entitled to retain a suitable status which will enable them to continue to use passports issued by the government of the United Kingdom, without conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom." The content and wording of the above British memorandum are the same as those of the Chinese memorandum, both of which were agreed upon by both sides.

In recent weeks, the British side has repeatedly claimed to continue to honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration and to restore Sino-British cooperation. However, it has now reneged on its commitments, disregarding the agreements between China and Britain, and unilaterally decided to grant full British citizenship to some Hong Kong residents. The British side also claimed that it would reserve a considerable number of people from the aforementioned 50,000 households to provide "opportunities for those who might enter key positions in Hong Kong in the later years close to 1997," and called on Britain's "partners and allies" to follow suit, openly attempting to "internationalize" Hong Kong's Chinese residents.

The British government's decision will inevitably create conflicts among Hong Kong residents, leading to division and opposition. In fact, since the decision was announced, it has caused considerable confusion among Hong Kong residents. All of this is clearly not conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Anyone who cares about the future of Hong Kong cannot ignore this.

The Chinese government demands that the British side consider the bigger picture and change the above erroneous approach; otherwise, it must bear the consequences that arise from this. The Chinese side reserves the right to take corresponding measures.

    英单方决定改变部分香港居民国籍
    我国政府要求英政府改变错误作法
    新华社北京12月30日电  外交部发言人今天就英国政府决定改变部分香港居民国籍问题发表谈话，全文如下：
    12月20日英国政府单方面宣布决定给予5万户（计22.5万人）香港居民以包括在联合王国居留权在内的完全英国公民地位。中国政府对英国政府的这一行动感到十分惊讶。
    英方的这一作法，严重违反了它自己的庄严承诺。5年前，在香港问题谈判中，有关香港居民的国籍问题，原已取得协议，双方并在此基础上交换了备忘录。英方的备忘录明确规定：“凡根据联合王国实行的法律，在1997年6月30日由于同香港的关系为英国属土公民者，从1997年7月1日起，不再是英国属土公民，但将有资格保留某种适当地位，使其可继续使用联合王国政府签发的护照，而不赋予在联合王国的居留权”。英方的上述备忘录的内容和措词，同中方的备忘录一样，都是经过双方商定的。
    最近几周以来，英方一再声称要继续信守中英联合声明，恢复中英合作关系，但现在却出尔反尔，不顾中英双方有关协议，单方面决定给予部分香港居民以完全的英国公民地位。英方还宣称，他们将在上述5万户中保留相当数额，以便在临近1997年的“稍后的年代中”给“那些可能在香港进入关键岗位的人以机会”，并号召英国的“伙伴和盟国”追随英国之后，依法炮制，公然企图将香港的中国居民“国际化”。
    英国政府的决定，势必在香港居民中制造矛盾，导致分化和对立。事实上，自决定公布之后，已经在香港居民中引起相当的混乱。这一切显然不利于香港的稳定和繁荣。任何关心香港前途的人，都不能对之熟视无睹。
    中国政府要求英方以大局为重，改变上述错误作法，否则必须承担由此而产生的一系列后果。中方保留对此采取相应措施的权利。
