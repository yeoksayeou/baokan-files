French banks widely use electronic computers, which can improve work efficiency, but there are also drawbacks: unscrupulous employees use tricks on the computer keyboard to commit theft. Such individuals are not few in number. According to statistics, France suffers an annual loss of 7 billion francs due to fraudulent behavior in the information technology sector.

Currently, France lacks effective measures to prevent such behavior, and the government can only strengthen legal penalties. For criminals who use electronic computers to commit theft, the fine can be as high as 200,000 francs, and the prison sentence can be as long as 10 years.

    电子行窃术
    法国银行普遍应用电子计算机，这可以提高工作效率，但也有弊端：心术不正的职员在计算机键盘上耍手法，进行盗窃。这类君子为数不少。据统计，法国一年内因信息技术领域里的舞弊行为而造成的损失高达70亿法郎。
    目前，法国尚无杜绝这种行为的良策，政府只好从法律上强化惩治措施，对利用电子计算机行窃的罪犯，罚款高达20万法郎，坐牢长达10年。
