The uses of tree bark are extensive and remarkable.

The bark of birch trees is white, soft, and easy to process. It can be used to make insoles, boxes, and packaging for food. It can also be used to build birchbark canoes. Birch bark contains 20-30% oil, which allows it to burn even in the rain, making it a useful material for torches to light the way in forested areas.

The bark of cork oak trees, commonly known as cork, is rough but light, soft, and elastic. People have been using it for a long time to make floating devices and life-saving equipment. After the widespread use of glass, cork was chosen as the material for bottle stoppers. With the rapid development of science and technology, cork is now used in a variety of fields. It is the best insulating material for refrigerating food on ships, trains, and airplanes. It is also an ideal shock-absorbing material for the bases of heavy machinery.

Spruce bark, after being compressed and heated to alter its fiber structure, can be made into wood balls that can replace coal and natural gas as fuel, and at a much lower cost. Spruce bark can also be processed into wood bricks. The bark and wood shavings of trees like larch can be used to make bark fiberboard, bark particleboard, gypsum bark board, and cement bark board.

Tree bark is also an important industrial raw material that can be used to produce various chemical products. For example, the bark of Chinese bayberry, water oak, mulberry, and other trees can be used to extract tannin. The bark of maple trees can be used to extract gum arabic. The bark of eucalyptus trees can be used to extract oxalic acid. The plant wax found in the bark of slash pine can be mixed with other waxes to make polishing wax and glossing agents. The bark of fir, larch, and pine trees can be used to extract adhesives that can replace wheat flour.

Tree bark can also be used to make ropes and strings, and it can be processed into "forest vinegar" for bottled beverages.

    树皮用途广
    树皮的用途极为广泛，功能非凡。
    桦树的树皮色白柔软、易于加工，可做鞋垫、箱子，也可用来包装食品，还可以造桦皮船。桦皮含油量高达20—30％，在雨中燃烧不会熄灭，林区人常用它作火把照明引路。
    栓皮栎的树皮，俗称软木，它虽然粗糙，但质地轻软，富有弹性，很早以前，人们就开始使用它制作水上飘浮工具、救生器材。人类广泛使用玻璃后，它又被选来作为瓶塞之用。随着科学技术的飞速发展，软木所涉足的领域越来越广，它是轮船、火车、飞机上食品冷藏中最佳的隔热材料；用作重型机器的底衬，又是理想的防震材料。
    松树皮经过加压、加热改变其纤维结构制成木质球，即可代替煤和天然气作燃料，价格也比煤和天然气低得多。用松树皮还可加工制作木砖。用云杉等树皮和木材加工的下脚料可以制成树皮纤维板、树皮刨花板、石膏树皮板和水泥树皮板等。
    树皮还是一种重要的工业原料，可生产多种化工产品。如杨梅、水青冈、苦楮、雏粟、构树；枫树的树皮可供提炼栲胶；杂种桉树皮可供提取草酸；花旗松树皮中的植物蜡与其它蜡混合可制成抛光蜡、打光剂；冷杉、云杉、落叶松树皮能提炼出代替小麦粉的胶合物。
    树皮还可以用来制作绳、线，又可加工成“森林醋”罐装饮料等等。　（11月30日《中国城乡开发报》）
