Wang Chi and his colleagues have spent over two years collectively discussing and writing "An Introduction to the Theory of Socialist Spiritual Civilization," which has been published by Hunan People's Publishing House. This book provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the objectives, tasks, and methods of the theory of socialist spiritual civilization, the characteristics, content, and structure of socialist spiritual civilization, particularly the goals and laws of building socialist spiritual civilization, as well as some major issues in practical construction. It also criticizes some incorrect viewpoints and tendencies. This book has certain guiding significance and reference value for the construction of spiritual civilization.

Firstly, the book proposes the establishment of a new discipline to guide the construction of socialist spiritual civilization—the discipline of Socialist Spiritual Civilization. This should be given attention. Some comrades have doubted the necessity of establishing this discipline and whether it can stand as a discipline. Many comrades affirm the establishment of this discipline, but they have not seriously studied how to reflect and prove the development laws of socialist spiritual civilization and how to establish the theoretical foundation of this discipline. In recent years, although some booklets and theoretical works on spiritual civilization have been published, the proposal to establish the discipline of Socialist Spiritual Civilization with a relatively complete system and certain depth is the first of its kind.

Mao Zedong pointed out: "The division of scientific research is based on the special contradictions possessed by the scientific object. Therefore, the study of a certain kind of contradiction unique to a certain domain of phenomena constitutes the object of a certain science." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 1, p. 148) Although many disciplines (such as philosophy, scientific socialism, ethics, sociology, political science, law, literature, and aesthetics) are closely related to the construction of spiritual civilization and can improve people's level of civilization from various different angles, the domain of socialist spiritual civilization has its own special contradictions, such as the progress and backwardness of people in spiritual production and spiritual life in socialist society, civilization and ignorance, nobility and meanness, truth, goodness, and beauty versus falseness, ugliness, and evil, as well as the struggle between proletarian thought and non-proletarian thought. These need to be specially studied; in the practice of building socialist spiritual civilization, there are many experiences and lessons that need to be summarized and elevated to theory, thereby revealing their development laws, and studying how to use these laws to guide spiritual civilization construction to develop healthily in depth. All of this shows that establishing a comprehensive discipline, namely, the discipline of Socialist Spiritual Civilization, is very necessary. Only through such a discipline can the relevant disciplines be connected, absorbing the research achievements of various disciplines on spiritual civilization construction, and integrating, merging, and systematizing them, in order to solve the various complex problems in socialist spiritual civilization construction.

Regarding the inherent laws of socialist spiritual civilization, the authors of this book, based on their own exploration, propose the overall law of the development of socialist spiritual civilization; the law of the unity of balance and imbalance in the development of spiritual civilization; the law of critical inheritance in the development of socialist spiritual civilization, as well as the issue of popularization and improvement in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and discuss them one by one. Currently, people have different understandings, expressions, and arguments about the laws and characteristics of socialist spiritual civilization, and even significant differences; however, this book provides a relatively systematic analysis and argumentation of these issues, proposing some fresh insights, which are indeed beneficial to the construction of this discipline.

The book devotes a considerable amount of space to exploring the goals of building socialist spiritual civilization, such as cultivating citizens' ideological, moral, political, and scientific and cultural qualities, how to cultivate physically and mentally healthy socialist new people, and how to build a civilized, healthy, and scientific way of life, etc. Taking the cultivation of new people's ideological and moral qualities as an example, it reveals the position and role of ideological and moral qualities in cultivating new people, expounds on the content and requirements of a scientific worldview, outlook on life, and the lofty ideal of communism, points out the paths and methods that people of all strata should strive for, etc. This is conducive to cultivating "four-haves" new people, especially the tempering and cultivation of young people, and to overcoming corruption, rectifying party style, and social customs.

One of the features of this book is its effort to link theory with practice. It does not merely focus on abstract concepts, principles, and theories because it aims to establish a new discipline. Concepts, principles, and theories are indeed necessary for establishing the theoretical foundation and framework; but they should not be limited to concepts, principles, and theories. When explaining some principles, laws, and major issues, one should pay attention to combining the party's policies and actual problems in real life to explain principles, achieving a combination of theory and practice. The book starts from the national condition that China is still in the primary stage of socialism, explaining both the theory and requirements of socialist spiritual civilization and the level that can be achieved in the current stage; it explains the requirements for party members, cadres, and advanced elements, while also considering the ideological level and acceptance of the broad masses of the people, thus increasing its guiding significance and readability.

Of course, as an introductory text for a newly established discipline, the content and system of this book are not without shortcomings. For example, one of the important contents of building socialist spiritual civilization is to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization. After the turmoil that occurred in the spring and summer of this year, with calm reflection and serious summary, it is necessary to emphasize this issue. In 1987, Li Chuan's edited "On the Construction of Spiritual Civilization," with a total of 18 chapters, had two chapters specifically discussing that spiritual civilization construction must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization. However, this book "Introduction" does not use a special chapter to discuss such a major issue, which cannot be said to be a major flaw. For example, to mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses to promote modernization construction and various tasks, to oppose corruption and rectify party style and social customs, it is necessary to pay special attention to, strengthen, and improve ideological and political work, and give full play to our political advantages. This is a major issue in spiritual civilization construction. As an "Introduction," it should also have a special chapter to discuss this. However, the book's summary of experience and theoretical explanation on this aspect is not given enough attention, which is also a deficiency.

Raising the above issues is to illustrate that the newly established, comprehensive discipline of Socialist Spiritual Civilization indeed has a vast and broad field awaiting in-depth exploration, and it is hoped that more people will participate in the research of this discipline to make it more complete and perfect.

    《社会主义精神文明学概论》评介
    沙英
    王驰等同志经过两年多集体探讨，编写的《社会主义精神文明学概论》一书，已由湖南人民出版社出版。本书对社会主义精神文明理论的对象、任务和方法，对社会主义精神文明的特征、内容和结构，特别是对社会主义精神文明建设的目标与规律，以及建设实践中的一些重大问题，都作了比较全面的分析和论述，同时也批评了一些不正确的观点和倾向。这对于精神文明建设具有一定的指导意义和参考价值。
    首先，本书提出要创建一门指导社会主义精神文明建设的新学科——社会主义精神文明学，力图使它形成一个融汇理论探索与实践经验于一炉的体系。这应当受到重视。有些同志对创建这门学科有无必要，对它作为一门学科能否立得起来，曾持怀疑态度。也有不少同志对创建这门学科是肯定的，但是对它如何反映和论证社会主义精神文明的发展规律，如何建立这一学科的理论基础，没有认真钻研。近几年来，虽然也出版了一些关于精神文明的小册子和理论著作，但是提出建立社会主义精神文明学，并有比较完整的体系和一定的深度，这还是首次。
    毛泽东指出：“科学研究的区分，就是根据科学对象所具有的特殊的矛盾性。因此，对于某一现象的领域所特有的某一种矛盾的研究，就构成某一门科学的对象。”（《毛泽东著作选读》上册，第148页）虽然有许多学科（例如哲学、科学社会主义、伦理学、社会学、政治学、法学、文学、美学等）都同精神文明建设有密切的关系，可以从各个不同的角度来提高人们的文明水平；但是社会主义精神文明领域有它自己的特殊的矛盾性，例如社会主义社会中人们在精神生产和精神生活中的进步与落后、文明与愚昧、高尚与卑微、真善美与假丑恶，以及无产阶级思想同非无产阶级思想的矛盾与斗争等等，则需要专门研究；在社会主义精神文明建设实践中有许多经验教训，也需要加以总结和上升到理论，从而揭示它们的发展规律，并研究如何运用这些规律来指导精神文明建设，使它健康地向纵深发展，所有这些都说明，建立一门综合性的学科，即社会主义精神文明学是非常必要的。只有通过这样一门学科，把有关的各个学科联系起来，吸收各门学科关于精神文明建设的研究成果，加以综合、融合和系统化，才能解决社会主义精神文明建议中的各种复杂问题。
    关于社会主义精神文明固有的规律，该书的作者们根据自己的探索，提出了社会主义精神文明发展的总体性规律；精神文明发展中的平衡与不平衡相统一的规律；社会主义精神文明发展的批判继承规律，以及社会主义精神文明建设的普及与提高问题，并一一作了论述。目前大家对社会主义精神文明的规律、特征的概括、表述与论证是不同的，甚至差异颇大；但是该书对这些问题作了较系统的分析和论证，提出了一些新鲜的见解，对这门学科的建树确实是有益的。
    该书用了较多的篇幅对社会主义精神文明建设的目标进行了探讨，例如对培养公民的思想、道德、政治素质和科学文化素质，如何造就身心健康的社会主义新人，怎样建设文明、健康、科学的生活方式等，作了较详细的论述。就以其中培养新人的思想、道德素质来说，揭示了思想、道德素质在培养新人中的地位和作用，阐述了科学的世界观、人生观和共产主义远大理想的内容和要求，指出了社会各阶层人民所应努力的途径和方法，等等。这对培养“四有”新人，特别是青年们的锻炼与修养，对克服腐败现象、端正党风和社会风气都是有促进作用的。
    该书的特点之一，是力求理论联系实际。它并不因为要创建一门新的学科，只从抽象的概念、原理、原则等方面去下功夫。概念、原理、原则固然对建立理论的基础和框架是很需要的；但不能局限在概念、原理、原则上，必须在阐明一些原则、规律和重大问题的时候，应当注意结合党的方针政策和现实生活中的实际问题、思想问题来讲道理，做到虚实结合，理论与实践的统一。该书从我国还处在社会主义初级阶段的国情出发，既阐明社会主义精神文明的理论和要求，又说明现阶段所能达到的水平；既阐明对党员、干部和先进分子的要求，又考虑到广大人民群众的思想水平和接受能力，这就增加了指导性和可读性。
    当然，该书作为一门初创的学科的概论，其内容和体系也有些不够或美中不足之处。比如说，社会主义精神文明建设的重要内容之一，是坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。经过今年春夏之交发生的风波之后，加以冷静思考和认真总结，就有必要强调这个问题。1987年李传时主编的《论精神文明建设》，全书共18章，其中就有两章专门论述精神文明建设必须坚持四项基本原则和坚决反对资产阶级自由化。可是《概论》这本书对这样重大的问题却未用专门的章节加以论述，这不能不说是一个很大的缺陷。比如说，为了调动干部群众的积极性来推动现代化建设和各项工作，为了反对腐败现象以端正党风与社会风气，要特别重视、加强和改进思想政治工作，充分发挥我们的政治优势，这是精神文明建设中的重大问题。作为一本《概论》来说，也应对此有专门的章节加以论述。可是该书对这方面的经验总结和理论说明，重视不够，也是一个缺欠。
    提出上述问题，旨在说明社会主义精神文明学这一初创的、崭新的、综合的学科，确实有无限广阔的天地有待深入探索，并希望有更多的人来参与这门学科的研究，使它日趋充实与完善。
