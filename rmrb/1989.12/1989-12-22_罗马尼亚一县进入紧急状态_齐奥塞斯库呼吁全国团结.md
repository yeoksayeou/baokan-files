Romania has declared a state of emergency in the western county of Timis. President Ceausescu has called for national unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 20th - Romanian President Ceausescu today issued an order declaring a state of emergency in the western county of Timis.

The order stipulates that military units, public security departments, and patriotic guards in Timis County are to be on high alert.

Ceausescu, who has just returned from a visit to Iran, delivered a televised speech tonight, calling on the people of the nation to unite and defend socialist construction.

He said that from December 16th to 17th, "terrorist activities" occurred in Timisoara, the capital of Timis County. "Several gangs of hooligans provoked disturbances, attacked some state organs, and vandalized and looted some buildings, stores, and public facilities."

Timisoara has a population of approximately 350,000 and is one of Romania's industrial and cultural centers.

Ceausescu said that on the night of the 17th, the military units that were attacked fired warning shots at the perpetrators. The military showed great restraint, and the soldiers only retaliated when the county's organs were attacked by terrorist groups and were in danger, fulfilling their duty to the motherland, the people, and the defense of socialist achievements.

He expressed his "deep regret" for the current situation but emphasized that those who instigated the incident and are responsible for the development of the situation are those who serve foreign intelligence agencies.

He called on the people of the nation to fully understand the current serious situation, to act responsibly, and to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    罗马尼亚一县进入紧急状态
    齐奥塞斯库呼吁全国团结
    新华社布加勒斯特12月20日电　罗马尼亚总统齐奥塞斯库今天发布一项命令，宣布西部的蒂米什县进入紧急状态。
    命令规定蒂米什县军队、内务部各单位和爱国卫队处于戒备状态。
    刚从伊朗访问回国的齐奥塞斯库总统今晚发表电视讲话，呼吁全国人民团结一致，保卫社会主义建设。
    他说，本月16日至17日在蒂米什县首府蒂米什瓦拉市发生了“恐怖主义行动”，“几个流氓团伙寻衅闹事，攻击了一些国家机关，捣毁和抢劫了一些建筑物、商店、公共设施”。
    蒂米什瓦拉市人口约35万，是罗工业、文化中心之一。
    齐奥塞斯库说，17日晚，受到攻击的军事单位向肇事者鸣枪警告。军队表现出了极大的克制，官兵们只是当该县机关受到恐怖集团攻击、处于危险时才进行了还击，为祖国、为人民和保卫社会主义成就尽了他们的义务。
    他对目前的事态表示“非常遗憾”，但他强调，对事态发展该负责的是那些服务于外国间谍机构的事端挑起者。
    他呼吁全国人民充分理解目前的严重局势，高度负责地行动起来，不要再让类似事件发生。
