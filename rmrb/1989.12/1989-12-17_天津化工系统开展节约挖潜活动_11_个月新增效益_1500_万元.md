The Tianjin chemical industry system has shifted its focus from relying on investment to tapping into the internal potential of enterprises to improve economic benefits. In the first 11 months of this year, the system achieved an additional benefit of 15 million yuan, making it the top contributor to the city's tax revenue.

The Tianjin chemical industry system employs 120,000 workers and consists of 200 enterprises, contributing 600 million yuan in annual tax revenue, making it a significant taxpayer for the state. This year, due to financial constraints and reduced investment, enterprises faced considerable challenges in improving their efficiency.

In response to these challenges, the system's leaders did not adopt a passive approach. Instead, they actively guided their enterprises to boost morale and explore various channels to launch cost-saving and potential-exploring activities.

The system encouraged employees to submit rationalization suggestions, identifying and addressing over 100 waste points. This effort reduced the per-ton salt consumption for soda ash and caustic soda by 20 kilograms and 22 kilograms, respectively. Over 10 months, 10,000 tons of salt were saved, valued at 1.5 million yuan.

The system focused on high-consumption issues as key areas for labor competitions, successfully addressing high consumption problems in sulfuric acid and agricultural product DDV. Preliminary statistics indicate that 3.6 million yuan were saved.

Repair and reuse teams were established to promote the repair and reuse of old equipment. For instance, the Dagang Chemical Plant has been consistently repairing 8,605 valves and 22,290 kilograms of screws for many years. The Chemical Electrical Equipment Factory reused silicon steel sheets from old transformers in 121 welding machines, saving 15,972 yuan.

The system organized engineering and technical personnel to adopt new technologies to reform old product formulas and processes, significantly reducing production costs. The Tianjin Tire Group developed low-cost raw materials to replace high-cost rubber and tire cord materials, resulting in high-quality products and saving 2.8 million yuan over 10 months.

    天津化工系统开展节约挖潜活动
    11个月新增效益1500万元
    本报天津12月16日电　记者程玉文报道：天津化工系统各级领导转变观念，把提高企业经济效益的着眼点从依靠投资转向深挖企业内部潜力上来。今年头11个月新增效益1500万元，为天津市上交利税的状元。
    天津化工系统有12万职工，200个企业，年上交利税6亿元，是国家的利税大户。今年以来，由于资金紧张，投资额减少，给企业提高效益带来很大困难。
    面对这种情况，这个系统主要领导不消极等待，而是积极引导所属企业振奋精神，开辟多种渠道开展节约挖潜活动。
    发动群众提合理化建议，堵死100多个浪费漏洞，使纯碱和烧碱两大类产品的吨盐耗下降20公斤和22公斤，10个月节盐1万吨，价值150万元。
    把消耗高的难点，作为组织工人开展劳动竞赛的重点，解决了硫酸和支农产品DDV消耗高的问题，据不完全统计节约资金达36万元。
    成立修旧利废小组，大力开展修旧利废活动，其中大沽化工厂多年坚持修复阀门8605个，螺丝22290公斤。化工电气设备厂把从旧变压器中拆下来的硅钢片重新使用在121台焊机上，节约资金15972元。
    组织工程技术人员采用新技术改变老产品配方和工艺，使产品成本大幅度下降，天津轮胎集团研制出用低价原料代替高价的橡胶和帘子布原料，产品质量好，10个月还节约资金280万元。
