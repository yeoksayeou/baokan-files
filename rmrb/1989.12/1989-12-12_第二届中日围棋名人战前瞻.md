While the Chinese people are rejoicing over the consecutive victories of Chinese players in several rounds of the China-Japan Go Championship, they may have overlooked the defeats of Chinese players in other significant events: the "Meijin" and "Kisei" titles from both sides have faced off in a "best-of-three" format, which better reflects the strength comparison, three times in recent years, with the Japanese side easily winning 2-0 each time, and the Chinese side failing to secure a single victory. Now, the new "Meijin" from both China and Japan have taken their positions, and the highest-level competition between the two countries' Go communities is about to begin again!

In his history of matches against Chinese players, Meijin Kobayashi Koichi has only been held to a 2-2 draw by Weiqi Saint Nie Weiping, with no other player able to defeat the 9-dan Kobayashi. All Chinese players who have faced Kobayashi have agreed that he is the most difficult to defeat. Money Yi Ping, a 9-dan player, once commented, "His intentions are clear and not difficult to understand, but every move seems to target the back of your head."

Ma Xiaochun, the Meijin, is young. He took the throne from the former Meijin Liu Xiaoguang with a decisive 3-0 score, indicating his ambition to achieve new successes to meet people's expectations. The two Meijin have faced each other three times on the field, twice in slow games and once in a fast game, all of which ended with Ma Xiaochun standing up from the board and conceding. This "Meijin Match" in the form of a "best-of-three" gives Ma Xiaochun another excellent opportunity. He was the second Chinese player after Nie Weiping to reach the "super-elite" level in Japan. This time, we hope he can once again follow Nie Weiping and become the second Chinese player to break through the "Kobayashi barrier."

In terms of skill, the two Meijin are quite evenly matched. Perhaps what Ma Xiaochun lacks compared to his opponent is the overwhelming aura and the belief in victory. In terms of playing style, Kobayashi's moves are solid and steady, meticulously planned, with few flaws; while Ma Xiaochun's moves are light and agile, seizing opportunities as they arise, and good at exploiting the opponent's weaknesses. Let's see how Kobayashi builds his impregnable fortress, and how Ma Xiaochun finds a chink in this "impregnable fortress." It can be foreseen that this round of the China-Japan "Meijin Match," regardless of the outcome, will present a highly exciting match to everyone.

    第二届中日围棋名人战前瞻
    正当国人们为中国棋手在数届中日围棋擂台赛上的不断获胜而欣然不已的时候，大家可能忽略了中方棋手在其它重要赛事上的失败：双方的“名人”和“天元”，近年曾三度以“三番棋”这种较能体现实力对比的形式交手，日方均轻松地以2∶0取胜，中方未能谋得一局。现在，中日新“名人”均已就位，两国围棋界最高水平的较量又一次来到了！
    小林光一名人在同中国棋手的对弈历史上，仅聂卫平棋圣以2∶2同他打了个平手，尚无另外任何一人能够战胜小林光一九段。所有同小林对局过的中国棋手，都认为他是最难击败的，钱宇平九段曾这样评论说：“他的棋意图明显，并不难懂，但却招招对着你的后脑勺。”
    马晓春名人年轻，他以3∶0的悬殊比分将前“名人”刘小光拉下宝座，取而代之，说明了他力图以新的好成绩赶上人们对他的期待。两位中日“名人”曾经三度相逢于赛场，两次慢棋，一次快棋，都是马晓春先从棋枰前站起身来，握手认负。这次“名人战”“三番棋”，又给了马晓春一次极好的机会，他曾经是中国继聂卫平之后第二个攀登上日本“超一流”高峰的棋手，这次希望他能再次追随聂卫平，成为第二个突破“小林壁垒”的中国棋手。
    就棋艺而言，应该说两位“名人”相去不远，马晓春所逊于对手的，也许仅仅是压倒对手的气概和必胜的信念。就棋风而言，小林光一行棋扎实稳健，步步为营，很少有漏洞；而马晓春则挥子轻灵机敏，遇隙便入，善于抓住对手弱点。我们且看小林光一如何构筑他的铜墙铁壁，而马晓春又怎样在这“铜墙铁壁”上找到一条缝。可以预见，本届中日“名人战”不论胜负如何，都将显示给大家极为精采的对局。　（巴斗）（附图片）
