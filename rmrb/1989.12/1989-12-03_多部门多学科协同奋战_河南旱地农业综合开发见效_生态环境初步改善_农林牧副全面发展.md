The Henan provincial government has organized multiple departments and disciplines to work together on a large-scale comprehensive development of dryland agriculture over the past four years. The ecological environment has shown initial signs of improvement, and there is a positive trend towards the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries. Statistics show that the total grain production in the treated areas this year reached 105.65 billion kilograms, an increase of 11.9 billion kilograms or 12.7% compared to last year.

The main dryland agricultural development areas in Henan Province are located west of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway in the hilly and mountainous regions. The total land area is approximately 760,000 square kilometers, with 38 million mu (approximately 25.3 million hectares) of arable land, accounting for 36.5% of the province's total arable land. These regions have high altitudes, complex terrain, thin soil, low rainfall, scarce water resources, and frequent natural disasters such as droughts. Agricultural production levels are low, development is slow, and there are significant fluctuations. In the early 1980s, some residents in these dry areas still faced food shortages.

In 1984, the provincial government, following the spirit of the national dryland agriculture conference, selected five counties in the Fuyu Mountain area of western Henan, covering 1.08 million mu of dryland, as a comprehensive development and research area for dryland agriculture. After two years of comprehensive development and research, initial results were achieved. The total agricultural output value increased by 1.29 times, and farmers' per capita income increased by 100 yuan. A set of comprehensive development and agricultural yield-increasing technologies was also developed, providing a scientific basis for the comprehensive development of dryland agriculture across the province.

Starting with improving the ecological environment, comprehensive treatment was carried out. Henan Province, in response to the severe soil erosion in the dryland agricultural areas, adopted a combination of biological and engineering measures. Every winter and spring, hundreds of thousands of laborers were mobilized to carry out large-scale small watershed treatment activities according to unified planning for watersheds and mountain ranges. The approach was to treat the upper areas first, then the lower areas, and to treat slopes before gullies, focusing on continuous and unified treatment in patches. After several years, 130 million yuan and over 100 million labor days were invested. A total of 3.62 million mu of water and soil conservation forests were planted, 96,000 mu of grass were sown, 1.1 million mu of terraces were built, and 245,000 mu of land were reclaimed from gullies. A total of 152 engineering projects were completed, controlling soil erosion over 32,000 square kilometers. After comprehensive treatment, the erosion degree in the small watersheds was reduced, soil moisture content increased, and water storage and moisture retention effects were significant. In Song County, located in the Fuyu Mountain area of western Henan, the water erosion modulus before treatment was 3,890 tons per square kilometer, which was reduced to 1,642 tons per square kilometer after treatment, a decrease of 63.2%. The newly constructed agricultural engineering projects can fully intercept rainfall of 100 millimeters in one go. After treatment, each mu of land in the counties under the jurisdiction of Luoyang City increased grain production by an average of 70 kilograms.

Combining traditional farming experience with modern agricultural technology, the promotion of comprehensive technologies such as water storage, moisture retention, fertilizer application, soil cultivation, and ground cover was emphasized. Agricultural technology personnel working in the treatment areas, in response to the uneven distribution of rainfall and low organic matter content in the soil, promoted a series of comprehensive technologies for water storage, moisture retention, and soil fertility improvement. In particular, the use of wheat straw, stalks, and plastic film for covering significantly increased soil temperature, reduced evaporation, retained moisture, controlled weeds, and increased agricultural production. Across the province's dry areas, 5.3 million mu of wheat straw and stalks were promoted for covering fields, and 80,000 mu were covered with plastic film. According to measurements in counties such as Luanchuan, Song, Ruyang, and Luoning, the yield increased by 80% compared to uncovered fields.

In response to the characteristics of the dry areas, the layout of crops was adjusted, and the planting area of drought-resistant crops such as sweet potatoes, millet, green beans, and sorghum was restored and expanded. According to the principles of combining high-stem and low-stem crops, nitrogen-loving and phosphorus-loving crops, and land use and soil improvement, the promotion of intercropping and relay cropping "double insurance" was emphasized, and high-yielding, high-quality, drought-resistant, and barren-resistant varieties were promoted. The coverage rate of improved varieties reached over 80%.

    多部门多学科协同奋战
    河南旱地农业综合开发见效
    生态环境初步改善　农林牧副全面发展
    据新华社郑州12月2日电　（记者张玉林）河南省政府组织多部门、多学科协同作战，对旱地农业实施大规模综合开发4年多来，生态环境已初步改善。出现农、林、牧、副业全面发展的好势头。据统计，治理区内今年粮食总产量达105.65亿公斤，比去年净增11.9亿公斤，增长12.7％。
    河南省的旱地农业开发区主要分布在京广铁路以西的丘陵山区，土地面积约7.6万平方公里，其中耕地3800万亩，占全省总耕地的36.5％。这些地区海拔较高，地形复杂，土壤瘠薄，降水偏少，水资源贫乏，以旱为主的自然灾害频繁，农业生产水平低，发展速度慢、波幅大，80年代初，部分旱区农民温饱问题尚未解决。
    1984年省政府根据全国旱地农业工作会议精神，选定豫西伏牛山区的5个县108万亩旱地作为旱地农业综合开发研究区，经过两年的综合开发研究已初见成效，农业总产值增长1.29倍，农民人均收入增加100元，并从中总结出一套旱地综合开发及农业增产的配套技术措施，为全省旱地农业综合开发提供了科学依据。
    从改善生态环境入手，进行综合治理。河南省针对旱地农业区水土流失严重的状况，采取生物措施与工程措施相结合的办法，连年开展了大规模的小流域治理活动。每年冬春都出动上百万民工，按照流域、山系的统一规划，先治上、后治下，先治坡、后治沟，集中连片统一治理，治一片、成一片、巩固一片。几年来共投资1300万元，1亿多工，营造水土保持林362万亩，种草9.6万亩，修梯田110万亩，闸沟淤地2.45万亩，完成各种工程152项，控制水土流失面积3200平方公里。经过综合治理的小流域，侵蚀程度减轻，土壤含水量增加，蓄水保墒效果显著。地处豫西伏牛山区的嵩县测定，治理前的水蚀模数为3890吨／平方公里，治理后减少为每平方公里1642吨，减轻63.2％；新修筑的农田工程，一次降雨100毫米可全部拦蓄。洛阳市所属各县治理后，每亩平均增产粮食70公斤。
    把农民传统经验同现代化农业科技结合起来，推广旱地农业蓄水保墒，增施农家肥，培养地力和地面覆盖等综合配套技术。在治理区工作的农业科技人员针对当地降雨分布不均，土壤有机质含量低等特点，推广了建立土壤水库，深耕改土、中耕镇压、增施农家肥等一整套蓄水保墒、培肥地力等综合技术措施。特别是利用麦糠、秸秆、地膜进行覆盖，对增加地温，减少蒸发，保住口墒，除治杂草，增加农业产量效果尤为明显。全省旱区推广麦糠、麦秸盖田530多万亩，地膜覆盖8万亩，据栾川、嵩县、汝阳、洛宁等县测定，覆盖与不覆盖相比增产80％。
    针对旱区特点，调整作物布局，恢复和扩大红薯、谷子、绿豆、高粱等耐旱作物面积，并按照高低秆作物相结合、喜氮和喜磷作物相结合、用地和养地相结合的原则，大力推广间作套种“双保险”并推广耐旱、耐瘠、高产、优质的优良品种，良种覆盖率达80％以上。
