The history of Hui medicine is long and proud. In terms of theory, medicine, prescriptions, folk remedies, and health care, it has always maintained distinct national characteristics to varying degrees. It has made significant contributions to the development of medicine in our country. This is the consensus of experts and professors who attended the first national academic conference on Hui medicine.

Recently, this academic conference was held in Xi'an. It was jointly organized by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the United Front Work Department, the Shaanxi Provincial Commission of Nationalities Affairs, and the Shaanxi Provincial Islamic Association.
