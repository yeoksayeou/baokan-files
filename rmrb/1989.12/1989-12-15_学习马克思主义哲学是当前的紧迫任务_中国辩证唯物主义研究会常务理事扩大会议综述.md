Late October, the Chinese Dialectical Materialism Research Association held an expanded meeting of its standing committee in Beijing. The meeting discussed how to implement the important speech given by Comrade Jiang Zemin on National Day and made research and arrangements in conjunction with the actual situation in the field of philosophy.

The attendees unanimously agreed that the urgent task of studying and researching Marxist basic theories, as proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin in his speech, and conducting research and discussions on major contemporary political, economic, and social theoretical issues under the guidance of Marxism, as well as the requirement to seriously study and research the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially to study and research Marxist philosophy, to master a scientific worldview and methodology, have extremely important practical and far-reaching historical significance. This is a profound summary of the historical experiences, both positive and negative, since the founding of the country, especially during the ten years of reform. It points out the direction for our theoretical workers, especially those engaged in Marxist philosophy, to conduct research and discussions. Some comrades said that our work is complex, but in essence, it boils down to one point: to combine Marxist universal truths with Chinese specific realities. Practice has proven that this combination is not easy; it is a very arduous and complex task, requiring considerable effort. To "combine," one must first study Marxist basic theories, especially Marxist philosophy. Marxist philosophy is a scientific worldview and methodology. Studying Marxist philosophy helps us explore various issues in politics, economics, and society in new practices and prevents us from losing our way in the complicated struggles. For cadres, only by studying Marxist philosophy can they enhance their awareness of implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies from the perspective of worldview and methodology.

The attendees mentioned that in the past, our academic circles were too narrow and somewhat detached from real life, and we did not pay enough attention to the needs of the broad masses. Therefore, we philosophers also have the issue of putting down our pretensions and correcting our relationship with the masses. Comrades unanimously expressed their willingness to respond to the Party Central Committee's call, to welcome the broad cadres to seriously study Marxist philosophy, and to do some practical work to contribute their own efforts. The meeting unanimously agreed that adhering to the principle of combining theory with practice and contributing to the study of philosophy is our duty.

The attendees believed that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has made significant achievements in combining Marxism with Chinese realities, emphasizing practicality, seeking truth from facts, and developing and verifying truth through practice. However, the question of whether we truly start from reality and seek truth from facts has not been fully resolved by everyone. In recent years, the mistakes in political, economic, ideological, theoretical, and spiritual civilization construction, although varied in form, have their profound ideological roots in problems with worldviews and methodologies. Practice has proven that Marxist philosophy has not become outdated and will not become outdated. Our socialist modernization and reform and opening-up cause must be guided by Marxism. We must resolutely oppose the erroneous tendency of denying Marxist basic principles and blindly worshipping Western bourgeois ideologies. Marxism has a strong vitality. This vitality lies in its constant connection with actual life and its ability to open up paths to solve various new problems encountered in practice. We must adhere to the basic principles of Marxism, deeply understand the current era, seriously study the new situations in China's construction and reform, scientifically summarize the new experiences in various aspects of work, and, based on the study of the practical experiences and scientific and technological achievements of the peoples of various countries today, enrich and develop Marxism under new historical conditions.

The attendees believed that the Chinese Dialectical Materialism Research Association, as a national academic organization for studying Marxist philosophy, bears the important task entrusted by the Party and the people of the whole country, which is to study and propagate Marxist philosophy, and to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization and firmly fight against all erroneous trends that oppose Marxist philosophy. We should leverage the advantages of the concentration of experts and strong academic strength within the Chinese Dialectical Materialism Research Association, actively collaborate with news and publishing units, and contribute our efforts to the work of studying and propagating Marxist philosophy. In particular, we should focus on the ideological education of Marxist philosophy for young people and students. The branches and all members of the Chinese Dialectical Materialism Research Association should seriously study Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech, unify their thoughts with the spirit of this speech, and, with the spirit of rectification, improve their own learning. On this basis, they should actively and proactively cooperate with the Party organizations in their respective regions and units to carry out the learning, propaganda, and education of Marxist philosophy. In terms of form, they should start from the actual situation, organize short-term training for instructors, hold thematic lectures and series of lectures, and compile easy-to-understand and popular books and pamphlets for the masses.

    学习马克思主义哲学是当前的紧迫任务
    ——中国辩证唯物主义研究会常务理事扩大会议综述
    10月下旬，中国辩证唯物主义研究会在京举行常务理事扩大会，就如何贯彻落实江泽民同志的国庆重要讲话进行了讨论，并结合哲学战线的实际作了研究和部署。
    与会同志一致认为，江泽民同志在讲话中所提出的关于把“学习和研究马克思主义基本理论，在马克思主义指导下研究和探讨当代重大的政治、经济、社会理论问题”的紧迫任务，关于“要提倡认真学习和研究马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基本理论，特别是学习和研究马克思主义哲学，掌握科学的世界观、方法论”的要求，具有十分重大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。这是对建国以来，特别是对十年改革中正反两个方面历史经验的深刻总结，为我们理论工作者，特别是从事马克思主义哲学的理论工作者指明了研究和探讨的方向。有的同志说，我们的工作千头万绪，但是概括起来就是一点：把马克思主义的普遍真理同中国具体实际相结合。实践证明，这个结合工作是很不容易的，是非常艰巨、复杂的，因而是需要花气力的。要“结合”首先就要学好马克思主义的基本理论，尤其要学好马克思主义哲学。马克思主义哲学是科学的世界观和方法论，学好马克思主义哲学，既有助于我们在新的实践中探讨政治、经济、社会等方面的诸多问题，又不至于在错综复杂的斗争中迷失方向。对于干部来说，只有学好马克思主义哲学才能从世界观和方法论上增强贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策的自觉性。
    与会同志谈到，过去我们学术圈子太狭窄了，与生活实际有些脱节，对广大群众的需要想得就不够。因此，我们哲学工作者自身也有个放下架子，摆正与群众关系的问题。同志们纷纷表示，要响应党中央的号召，为迎接广大干部认真学习马克思主义哲学，切切实实地做些工作，贡献自己的一份力量。会议一致认为，贯彻理论联系实际的原则，为学好哲学作贡献是我们责无旁贷的任务。
    与会同志认为，党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党在把马克思主义与中国实际相结合方面取得了很大的成绩，一切从实际出发，实事求是，在实践中检验和发展真理的思想路线得到了恢复和发展。但是，是否真正一切从实际出发，实事求是的问题并不是所有人都解决了。近年来政治、经济、思想理论和精神文明建设等方面的失误，尽管在表现形式上各不相同，但其深刻的思想根源依然是世界观和方法论上出了毛病。实践证明，马克思主义哲学没有过时，也不会过时。我们的社会主义现代化和改革开放事业，必须以马克思主义为指导。我们要坚决反对那种否定马克思主义基本原理，盲目崇拜西方资产阶级思潮的错误倾向。马克思主义是有强大生命力的。这种生命力就在于它始终同实际生活保持着密切的联系，在于它能够为解决实践中遇到的各种新问题开辟道路。我们一定要遵循马克思主义的基本原理，深刻了解当前的时代，认真研究我国建设和改革中的新情况，科学地概括各方面工作的新经验，同时在研究当代各国人民的实践经验和科学技术新成果的基础上，使马克思主义在新的历史条件下得到丰富和发展。
    与会同志认为，中国辩证唯物主义研究会作为研究马克思主义哲学的全国性学术团体，它肩负着党和全国人民赋予的重要任务，那就是研究马克思主义哲学，宣传马克思主义哲学，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，同一切反对马克思主义哲学的错误思潮进行坚决的斗争。我们要发挥中国辩证唯物主义研究会中专家集中、学术力量雄厚的优势，主动和新闻出版单位相配合，为学习和宣传马克思主义哲学的工作贡献自己的力量。这当中尤其要做好对青年、青年学生的马克思主义哲学的灌输工作。中国辩证唯物主义研究会的各分会和全体会员，要认真学习江泽民同志的重要讲话，把思想统一到这个讲话的精神上来，并以整风的精神搞好自身的学习，在此基础上积极主动地配合所在地区、所在单位的党组织搞好马克思主义哲学的学习、宣传和教育。在形式上，要从实际情况出发，可以搞短期的辅导员培训，可以举办专题讲座、系列讲座，也可以编写通俗易懂，为群众所喜闻乐见的读本、小册子。　（廓　天）
