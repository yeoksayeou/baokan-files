Adhering to the mass line and improving work styles is an important aspect and guarantee for implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: "The mass line is our fundamental work line, and it is also our fundamental leadership style and work method." Reiterating this point today is of great significance.

Currently, the tasks facing the Chinese people are extremely arduous. We must further rectify and deepen reforms to promote sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development. We must maintain and develop a stable and united political situation, clarify the ideological confusion caused by the rampant bourgeois liberalization over the past few years, and continue to advance the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilizations. The Party and the state are at a critical juncture. To accomplish the various tasks proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, we must adhere to the Party's mass line.

Serving the people is the fundamental purpose of our Party. To serve the people well, we must understand the sentiments, opinions, and demands of the masses and make correct decisions based on this understanding. The errors and deviations we make in our work ultimately stem from our detachment from the masses and our lack of correct understanding of the actual situation and the demands of the masses, resulting in subjective perceptions that do not align with objective reality. The task of leadership is to make decisions, and only through democratic decision-making can we achieve scientific decision-making.

To understand the masses, we must go among them. Spending all day in the office, consulting a few "elites," drafting one plan today and another tomorrow, is bound to lead to mistakes and oversights. Of course, emphasizing the mass line does not mean engaging in formalistic "mass movements," nor does it mean criticizing the so-called "expert line." Adhering to the mass line and relying on experts are not contradictory. Seeking advice from experts and fully considering their opinions during decision-making is an important aspect of implementing the mass line. True experts derive their correct opinions from reality and from the masses, and these opinions are verified through mass practice. Relying on the masses and respecting expert opinions are consistent.

Coming from the masses and going to the masses is the basic content of the mass line. The Party's correct policies and guidelines come from the masses and guide the masses. To formulate correct policies, cadres must first go among the masses and into the actual situation. This is the prerequisite for implementing correct ideological and work leadership. After making decisions, one must also go among the masses to do a good job of propagating and explaining the Party's policies and guidelines. The Party's policies represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and will be supported by the masses. However, in certain situations, some specific policies may not be understood by the masses at first. This requires leaders at all levels to go among the masses, engage in dialogue and heart-to-heart talks, and do solid ideological and political work to ease contradictions and prevent their escalation. If a decision is wrong, it must be corrected promptly to gain the understanding of the masses. During the period of rectification, there are many difficulties and problems, and it is even more necessary for leaders to maintain close and frequent contact with the broad masses. The masses are willing to speak to the leadership and share their difficulties, which is a sign of their trust in the Party organization. Leaders must rely on the masses and believe in the masses. Leaders who do not believe in the masses will never be good leaders.

Cadres should be among the masses, not above them. They should share joys and sorrows with the masses and blend in with them. During the war years and the three years of difficulty, the people faced much greater hardships than today, but they did not complain or fear difficulties. An important reason for this was that the leadership was among the masses, doing ideological work and sharing hardships with them. This good tradition should be carried on and developed.

After 10 years of reform and opening up, the broad masses of the people are intellectually active, good at thinking, and have a strong sense of social responsibility and participation. This poses higher demands on leaders at all levels to implement the mass line and also provides them with a better classroom to learn from the masses. It is hoped that leaders at all levels will strive to explore and create a set of mass line work methods suitable for the new situation and new characteristics, so that the decision-making level of the leadership can be further improved, and our leaders at all levels can become people who are loved, trusted, and respected by the masses.

In the past few months, central leaders have frequently gone to various places to conduct investigations and research among the masses, and leaders at all levels are also going among the masses and to the grassroots according to the central government's requirements. The relationship between the leadership and the masses is closer than before. This is a significant change in leadership style and a very encouraging trend. Let us remember the fundamental work line of the mass line in the new historical period and carry it forward.

### 坚持党的群众路线

    坚持党的群众路线
    坚持群众路线，改进工作作风，是贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神的一项重要内容和重要保证。江泽民同志指出：“群众路线是我们根本的工作路线，也是我们根本的领导作风和工作方法。”今天重申这一点，具有重要的意义。
    当前，我国人民面临的任务十分艰巨。要进一步治理整顿和深化改革，促进经济持续、稳定、协调地发展。要维护和发展安定团结的政治局面，澄清几年来资产阶级自由化泛滥造成的思想混乱，把社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设继续推向前进。党和国家处在一个关键时期。要完成十三届五中全会提出的各项任务，必须坚持党的群众路线。
    为人民服务，是我们党的根本宗旨。要为人民服好务，必须了解群众情绪、意见和要求，据以作出正确的决策。我们在工作上犯错误、出偏差，归根到底，都是由于脱离了群众，对实际情况和群众的要求缺乏正确的了解，主观认识不符合客观实际。领导的任务就是要作决策，只有决策民主化，才能做到决策科学化。
    要了解群众，必须深入群众。成天呆在机关里，找几个“精英”，今天制订这个方案，明天制订那个方案，非出岔子、出漏子不可。当然，强调群众路线，并不意味着要搞形式主义的“群众运动”，也不是要批判所谓“专家路线”。坚持群众路线和依靠专家并不矛盾。有事请教专家，在决策时充分听取专家的意见，这正是贯彻群众路线的一个重要方面。真正的专家，他的正确意见也是从实际出发，从群众中来，并且经过群众实践的检验的。依靠群众和尊重专家意见，是一致的。
    从群众中来，到群众中去，是群众路线的基本内容。党的正确的方针、政策来自群众，又指导群众。为了制定正确的政策，干部首先要深入群众、深入实际。这是实施正确的思想领导和工作领导的前提。决策以后，还要深入到群众中，做好党的方针、政策的宣传解释工作。党的政策代表广大群众的根本利益，是会受到群众拥护的，但在某些情况下，某些具体政策一时不为群众理解也是可能的。这就需要各级领导同志到群众中去，和群众对话、谈心，做扎扎实实的思想政治工作，缓解矛盾，避免激化。如果决策有误，要及时纠正，取得群众的谅解。在治理整顿期间，困难多、问题多，更需要领导干部同广大群众保持经常的密切的联系。群众有话愿意给领导上说，有困难愿意向领导上讲，这是对党组织信赖的表现。领导要依靠群众必须相信群众。不相信群众的领导，决不会是一个好的领导者。
    干部要居于群众之中，不要站在群众之上。要和群众同甘共苦，与群众打成一片。在战争年代和三年困难时期，人民群众面对着比今天大得多的困难，但他们不叫苦，不怕难，很重要的一个原因是领导在群众之中，既做思想工作，又同他们一道吃苦。这个好的传统，应该继承和发扬。
    经过10年改革开放实践的广大群众，思想活跃，善于思考，有强烈的社会责任感和参与意识。这就对各级领导同志贯彻群众路线提出更高的要求，也为他们提供了向群众学习的更好课堂。希望各级领导干部努力探索和创造出一套适应新形势、新特点的群众路线的工作方法，使领导的决策水平更加提高，使我们各级领导干部成为群众心目中可亲、可信、可敬的人。
    近几个月来，中央领导同志经常到各地深入群众，调查研究，各级领导同志也正在按照中央的要求到群众中去，到基层去，干群关系比过去亲密了。这是领导作风上的一个显著变化，是一个很喜人的势头。让我们今后牢记群众路线这条根本的工作路线，在新的历史时期把它发扬光大。
