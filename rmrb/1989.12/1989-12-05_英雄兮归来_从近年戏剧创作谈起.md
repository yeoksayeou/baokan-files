It has been a long time, heroes of the stage!

Since the opposition to the "three prominences" style of superhuman idolization, literary and artistic creations have also included heroes and model figures in the sweeping purge, which somewhat tastes like distinguishing between the innocent and the guilty, and causing collateral damage.

In the scorching wind of Brecht, the old man Galileo, who died three and a half centuries ago, appeared on stage, saying a rather modern line: "A country that needs heroes is a tragic one!" The old man's words had a catalytic effect on those who were changing their aesthetic tastes. They appreciated Galileo's eating of goose legs and his love for food far more than his great scientific spirit. From then on, the artistic images on our stage, like well-trained soldiers, began a 180-degree turn, from the ranks of heroes to the formation of anti-heroes. Those immaterial and towering figures were expelled, while those who lacked ideals, were indifferent to their careers, and indulged in material enjoyment quickly swelled. Enjoying life became the standard for affirming a character. Reformers must swim, dance, drink coffee, and fall in love. Ideals were seen as fairy tales, principles as rigid dogmas, and food and sex were emphasized as human nature, with hippie attitudes praised as elegant demeanor. There was a play that wrote about the troubles of a model figure, exaggerating the contrast between the model and ordinary people's lives. Being a model meant losing friendship, love, family happiness, and legitimate material enjoyment. Being a model was a distortion of human nature, and cultivating models was an inhumane act that stifled human nature. Careers, ideals, honor, and noble personalities had all lost their value and faded away. What was important was to maintain the friendship among brothers and sisters and to gain worldly recognition. Enduring, suffering humiliation, and giving up actions to melt into the worldly human emotions that had become materialistic, this was the final choice and destiny of the model figures.

The momentum of this anti-hero wave was so strong that even historical heroes and founding leaders of the party were not spared from its attack. "Leaders are also human." This plain statement was highly appreciated by artists, who treated it as a new discovery. The implicit meaning was that leaders also have seven emotions and six desires, also have romantic feelings, and cannot guarantee they have no private interests. Thus, focusing on revealing the leaders' private affairs became a new creation model. Indeed, leaders come from ordinary people, and they naturally possess the emotions that ordinary people have. However, do not forget that leaders are extraordinary precisely because they possess qualities, wisdom, and strength that ordinary people do not have, cannot have, but yearn for. It is precisely because of this that they stand out and are respected by people. However, under the guidance of anti-hero theory, the image of leaders has shown temper tantrums, loneliness, shedding tears, kindness to old cooks, and the elegance of scholars, but often lacks the luster of ideals, the passion of dedication, the extraordinary wisdom, and the majestic demeanor that shakes the mountains and rivers. After watching these plays about leaders, one is left puzzled as to how these ordinary people on stage became the heroes who dominated the times? We are not without emotions and romance, but why do we have to sit in the theater to admire their romantic affairs?

The trend of non-heroization and anti-heroization in creation, as a reaction to the deification of figures in the previous period, is understandable. However, the question we want to raise is, does opposing the deification of images necessarily mean reducing heroic figures to the level of ordinary people, taking the path of vulgarization and even vulgarity? Can't we replace the old deification of heroes with a new heroism? And our times are calling for and creating heroes. When those souls permeated with private desires bow down to the dagger of the villain, people yearn for the reincarnation of heroes like Anke; when our socialist construction encounters countless risks, people yearn for strong leaders to guide the people through the rapids and shoals. The social reality of recent years has educated people. Immersed in the ocean of private desires, material desires, and sensual desires, our society, cause, and life will not progress. When people see no prospect of changing the decadent trend of material desires, they have a strong nostalgia for the social customs of the 1950s, yearning for that era full of heroic spirit.

This sentiment naturally reflects in literary works. Recently, the Beijing performances of the Peking opera "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" (Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe) and the spoken drama "Wa Huang Yu" (Comrade Spoken Drama Troupe) both feature outstanding historical figures and model figures in reality, highlighting their extraordinary personal strength, and becoming true heroes in the real sense.

The sublime beauty has returned to our art, making people's hearts tremble and souls elevate. Of course, we also need the beauty of form, the pure beauty, and the constant innovation in techniques and methods. However, do not forget that art is attached to the spirit of man and expresses the spirit of man. The beauty of the spirit, the greatness of the spirit can endow art with the highest quality. As early as two hundred years ago, Kant drew such a conclusion: "The sublime... is attached to the ideal of reason," "Beauty is the expression of the moral spirit."

Is the return of the heroic spirit in art a retro trend? Is our literature and art going to enter a new round of idol-making movement? Any repetition of historical phenomena is not a simple return. These figures who have just emerged on our stage are not simply products of political tasks and artificial idol-making, but the sublimation of social and temporal needs. They have distinct artistic characteristics different from deified heroes. Although the two plays mentioned above have their own flaws, the former, as a historical drama, is far from historical facts, and the latter lacks unity in theme, structure, and style. However, both have achieved new depths in the portrayal of their main characters. The personalities of the characters are rich, vivid, and realistic, making their extraordinary qualities organically unite with universal human nature. Cao Cao's killing of his wife and deception is his decisive action after overcoming great inner pain. The play uses an entire scene to depict Cao Cao's inseparable love for his wife, and in the pain and endurance, there is both ordinary human emotion and a transcendence of love for children; In "Wa Huang Yu," Dian Dama fights for principles, but her heart is also turbulent. Her opponent had saved her during the Cultural Revolution, and she also knows how to repay kindness, but she cannot use the interests of the villagers as a bargain. Bitter gall for worry, she cuts off her personal emotions and completes the extraordinary image of the great self. It should be pointed out that it is the experience of creating ordinary people and ordinary hearts in the previous stage that laid the foundation for the creation of non-deified heroic characters, enabling today's creators to grasp the rich and subtle relationship between the ordinary and the extraordinary of characters more accurately, and erecting living heroes and living people in the gallery of artistic images.

Perhaps one day, the light of ideals and wisdom will shine on everyone's heart, and everyone will be a hero. The title of hero will no longer exist, just as everyone becomes an artist, and the social division of labor of artists will disappear on its own. But this is not the reality of our current society. Our times need the spirit of heroes, the great deeds of heroes, and the sentiments of heroes. Therefore, we hope that more heroes who are ironclad and outstanding among the mediocre will appear on the stage.

    英雄兮归来
    ——从近年戏剧创作谈起
    高鉴
    久违了，舞台上的英雄！
    自打反对“三突出”式的超级造神运动以来，文艺创作将英雄、模范人物也排在横扫之列，这终有些皂白不分、祸及九族的味道了。
    在灼人的布莱希特旋风中，作古三个半世纪的伽利略老头披挂上台，说了句颇现代派的台词：“需要英雄的国家是可悲的！”老人的话对那些正在转换审美情趣的人们更有推波助澜的功效，他们对伽利略啃鹅腿、有口腹癖嗜的欣赏远远超过了对他伟大科学精神的崇敬。从那时起，我们舞台上的艺术形象好似训练有素的士兵，开始了180度的大转向，从英雄的行列调头排成反英雄的方阵。那些不食人间烟火的高大全形象被驱逐出列，那些缺乏理想、淡薄事业、耽迷于物欲享受的庸碌之辈却迅速膨胀。享受人生，成为衡量人物的肯定性准绳，凡改革家必定会游泳、跳舞、喝咖啡、谈恋爱。视理想为天方夜谭，视原则为僵死教条，食色作为人之本性加以突出强调，嬉皮士作派当作潇洒风度大加赞赏。有一出戏，写模范人物的苦恼，剧中夸张地将模范与普通人的生活对峙起来。当模范就会失去友情、爱情、天伦之乐和正当的物质享受，当模范就是对人性的扭曲，培养模范则是不仁不义、扼杀人性之举。事业、理想、荣誉、高尚的人格都已失落价值、黯淡无光，重要的是维护哥们姐们的情义，获得世俗的认同。忍让、受辱、放弃作为、为那物欲化了的世俗人情融化，这便是模范人物最终的选择和归宿。
    这种反英雄的浪潮的势头之大，连历史上的英雄、建党开国的领袖也未能幸免它的袭击。“领袖也是人。”这句大白话很得文艺家们的欣赏，将其当作一种新发现，其潜台词则是领袖也有七情六欲，也有儿女情长，也难保没有私心猫溺，于是集中笔力发掘领袖私情，又成为一种新的创作模式。固然，领袖出自常人，人所具有的情感，他不例外地也会具备。但是请勿忘记，领袖之所以超群，英雄之所以伟大，正因为他们还具有普通人所不具备、难具备、却又向往之的品格、智慧、力量，唯其如此，他们才愈显高大，受人崇敬。然而在反英雄理论指导下的创作，领袖形象有了发脾气的任性、有了郁闷洒泪的孤独、有了对老炊事班长的和蔼、有了相互戏谑的名士风度，却常常少了理想的光辉，献身的激情、超凡的智慧和威振山河的气概。看完这些领袖戏，令人百思不得其解的是这些舞台上的芸芸众生何以成为叱咤时代风云的一代天骄？吾等亦非无情无义之辈，也有恋爱嬉闹的本事，却为何要坐在剧场里去瞻仰他们的风流往事呢？
    非英雄化、反英雄化的创作倾向作为对前一时期神化人物的反拨是可以理解的。但是我们要提出的问题是，反对神化形象是否非要将英雄人物降到普通人水平，走世俗化乃至庸俗化的路子？难道不能以新的英雄观来取代旧的神化英雄观吗？而我们的时代却在呼唤并创造着英雄。当那些被私欲浸透的灵魂在歹徒的匕首面前奴颜婢膝的时候，人们是多么期望安珂这样英雄的再世；当我们的社会主义建设事业遇到重重风险的时候，人们是多么盼望有坚强的领路人引导人民闯过激流险滩。近年来的社会现实教育了人们，沉浸在私欲、物欲和肉欲的海洋中，我们的社会、事业和生活是不会前进的。当人们看不到改变那种物欲横流糜烂风气的前景的时候，就产生了强烈的怀旧情绪，怀念50年代的社会风尚，怀念那个充满了英雄主义豪情的时代。
    这种情怀自然而然地反映到文艺作品中来。最近在北京上演的京剧《曹操和杨修》（上海京剧团）和话剧《娲皇峪》（战友话剧团）分别以历史的杰出人物和现实的模范人物为主要人物，突出刻画了他们非同凡响的人格力量，而成为真正意义上的hero（英雄、主角）。
    崇高的美又回到我们的艺术中来了，它使人们回肠荡气、灵魂升华。固然，我们也需要形式的美、纯粹的美，需要在技巧手法上的不断创新，但是切勿忘记，艺术是附丽于人的精神的，是表现人的精神的。精神的美、精神的伟大才能赋予艺术最高的品格。早在二百年前康德就得出了这样的结论：“崇高……附丽于理性的理想”，“美是道德精神的表现。”
    英雄主义艺术精神的回归是不是一种复古潮流呢？我们的文艺是不是又要进入新一轮的造神运动呢？任何历史表象的重复都不是简单的折返。这些刚刚在我们的舞台上崭露头角的风云人物、英雄人物不是简单地配合政治任务，人为造神的产物，而是社会与时代需求的升华，他们具有区别于神化英雄的显著艺术特征。尽管上面提及的两出戏都有各自的缺陷，前者作为历史剧却与史实相去甚远，后者则在主题、结构和格调的把握上缺乏整一性，但是两者在主要人物的塑造上都取得了新的沉就，人物性格具有丰富性、生动性和真实性，使他们身上的非凡特质与普遍人性有机地统一起来，曹操杀妻行骗是他克服了巨大内心痛苦的决断，剧中以整整一场戏渲染曹操与爱妻的难分难舍之情，一痛一忍之间既有常人情感，又有对儿女之情的超越；《娲皇峪》中的田大娘为坚持原则作斗争，内心又何曾没有波澜汹涌？她的对手在“文革”时曾对她有搭救之恩，她也知恩图报，但她不能以村民的利益作交易。苦胆为忧天，她绝了小我之情，完成了大我的不凡形象。应该指出，正是前一阶段塑造普通人、平凡心灵的创作经验为非神化的英雄性格创造奠定了基础，使今天的创作人员能够较为准确地把握人物的平凡与超凡之间丰富而细腻的关系，在艺术形象的画廊中耸立起活生生的英雄，活生生的人。
    或许有一天，理想和智慧的光芒照亮了每个人的心头，人人都是英雄，英雄的称号便不复存在，一如人人都成为艺术家，艺术家的社会分工便自行消亡，但这决不是当前社会的现实。我们的时代需要英雄的气概、英雄的伟业、英雄的情怀。因此，我们期望着更多铁中铮铮、庸中佼佼的英雄登上舞台。
