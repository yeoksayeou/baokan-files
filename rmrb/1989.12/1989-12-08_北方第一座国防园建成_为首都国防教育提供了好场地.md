Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7th.

The first national defense park in northern China was completed today in Beijing.

The grand building, with an exhibition area of over 1,000 square meters, is located within the Beijing Tongxian Youth Palace. It was constructed in 10 months by the military and civilians of the capital. The park consists of a knowledge hall, an audio-visual hall, an armaments hall, and an armaments field. Through pictures, real objects, and videos, it systematically introduces the history of imperialist aggression against China, the glorious journey of the Chinese people in seizing political power through armed struggle, the tremendous development of national defense in New China, and the relevant situation of the capital's suppression of turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, as well as military knowledge. The completion of the national defense park provides an excellent venue for national defense education in the capital.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councilor, and Minister of National Defense Qin Jiwei inscribed the name of the park. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee Li Ximing cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony. State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department Yu Yongbo, and Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region Liu Zhenhua attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches.

The Beijing Municipal National Defense Education Leading Group, chaired by Chen Xitong, was also established today.
