People's Daily, Shanghai, December 16th - Correspondents Zhang Shihong and Liu Shian report: More than 20,000 employees in Shanghai's watch industry are engaged in a discussion centered around the theme "The country faces difficulties, what should we do?" This initiative has sparked a wide response within Shanghai's business community. Many enterprises have found renewed vigor and pathways to overcome difficulties through this discussion.

Why launch this discussion? The leadership of the Shanghai Watch Company explained that it is a response to the current economic challenges. In the first 10 months of this year, due to a sluggish market, funding shortages, and mismatched products, various enterprises have faced significant difficulties. Should we sigh and complain, blame external factors, or should we face the challenges head-on and find a way out? Should we look upwards for help or mobilize the masses to work together to find solutions? Every party member and cadre faces a stern test. The Municipal Party Committee has proposed that the current central task is "to stabilize and to boost morale," so what should we do? After conducting investigations, they decided to focus on the theme "The country faces difficulties, what should we do?" and launch a comprehensive discussion across the industry.

In this discussion, the industry's party, government, trade union, and youth league organizations have all been mobilized. They have proposed that everyone should start from reality and from themselves to answer this question. The discussion has been ongoing for over a month, and many rational suggestions have been put forward. Factory directors have quickly formulated specific plans to overcome difficulties, and both upper and lower levels have started taking action. The situation in each factory has changed, which shows that the masses indeed harbor a great deal of socialist enthusiasm. The questions raised by the party committee are also issues that many cadres and masses are pondering, hence the immediate resonance.

From the perspective of Shanghai's watch industry discussion, the effectiveness of the discussion largely depends on the attitude of the factory leadership and whether they are truly determined to lead the masses forward. The experience of the China Clock Factory is quite enlightening. The "Three-Five" brand clocks produced by this factory were once popular, but in the past two years, they have been on a downward trend. By October this year, 170,000 clocks were backlogged, and the factory is expected to incur a loss of 5 million yuan this year. During this concentrated discussion, the factory leadership acknowledged that while objective difficulties exist, there have been significant mistakes made by the leadership. At a staff meeting, the factory leadership first took responsibility and then frankly disclosed the factory's difficulties to the staff. The staff felt that the leadership's attitude was sincere and were generally satisfied. Based on everyone's suggestions, the leadership reallocated work and also formulated plans for next year in advance. Now, 40,000 backlogged clocks have been sold. The entire factory is spirited, believing that there is hope to emerge from the trough.

Each factory has its own set of problems, and the discussion aims to concentrate efforts to tackle these issues. The main problem for the Watch Factory Three is that the company has assigned them an additional task of producing 90,000 export watches. For every additional watch exported, the factory loses 8-10 yuan in revenue. Are the workers willing to bear this loss? Through the discussion, the workers said, "The enterprise is facing difficulties, and the country's difficulties are even greater. We are willing to bear some losses to earn more foreign exchange for the country."

This discussion in the watch industry has also promoted a change in factory culture. In some factories, cadres have started working in the workshops, and in others, efforts are being made to solve issues related to housing allocation and improving the canteen. Recently, the China Clock Factory cleared the site for installing a new production line. Due to the party members taking the lead, a project that used to take a month to complete was finished in just 10 days, and no one asked for any payment.

The discussion has brought new achievements. The leadership of the Watch Company said with confidence that this year, the watch production and sales are expected to be fully realized, and the export tasks can be completed ahead of schedule and in excess.

The impact of this discussion is spreading to various industries in Shanghai. The Party Committee of the Light Industry Bureau has called for enterprises in the municipal light industry system to launch this discussion. The textile system's 24 advanced enterprises have jointly issued a call to action, hoping to launch a comprehensive discussion across the entire municipal textile system. The scientific and technological front has proposed, "The economy faces difficulties, what should science and technology do?" Teams of scientific and technological experts are entering enterprises to make scientific and technological advantages play a role in overcoming economic difficulties.

Currently, the vast rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs are further carrying out the campaign to build achievements and establish businesses, discussing plans for next year to create new businesses for their hometowns.

    上海钟表业开展“国家有困难，我们怎么办”大讨论
    激发主人翁精神为企业分忧
    带动其他行业增强改革信心
    本报上海12月16日电　记者章世鸿、刘士安报道：上海钟表行业两万多名职工，围绕“国家有困难，我们怎么办？”这个扣人心弦的题目，正在展开大讨论。此举在上海企业界引起广泛反应。许多企业在这场大讨论中激发了斗志，找到了克服困难的途径。
    为什么要开展这场大讨论？上海钟表公司党委领导说，这是针对目前面临的经济困难提出的。今年头10个月，由于市场疲软，资金短缺，产品不对路，给各企业带来很大的困难。是唉声叹气，怨天尤人，还是知难而进，走出困境？是眼睛向上等靠要，还是眼睛向下发动群众齐心协力想办法？每个党员和干部都面临严峻考验。市委提出当前的中心工作是“一要稳定，二要鼓劲”，我们该怎么办？他们通过调查研究，决定抓住“国家有困难，我们怎么办？”这个题目，在全行业开展一场大讨论。
    在大讨论中，这个行业的党、政、工、团一齐发动，提出每个人都要从现实出发，从自己出发，来回答这个问题。讨论已持续一个多月，许多合理化建议提出来了，厂长也很快制定出克服困难的具体方案，上下开始行动起来。各厂形势都起了变化，这说明了什么？公司党委领导说，这说明群众中确实蕴藏着很大的社会主义积极性，党委提出的问题也是广大干部、群众正在苦思冥想的问题，因而一拍即合。
    从上海钟表行业的大讨论看，讨论的成效主要看厂领导的态度，是否真有决心带领群众前进。中国钟厂的经验很有启发。这个厂生产的“三五牌”时钟，过去是畅销的名牌产品，但这两年一直在走下坡路。到今年10月份，时钟积压17万台，今年预计要亏损500万元。厂领导班子在这次集中讨论中认为，客观困难是事实，但领导上确有不少失误。在职工大会上，厂领导首先承担了责任，同时把厂内困难原原本本向群众交底。职工们感到领导的态度是诚恳的，比较满意。厂领导根据大家的主意，对工作重新作了具体部署，还及早制定了明年的计划。现在，积压的时钟已推销4万台。全厂上下精神振奋，认为走出低谷大有希望。
    每个工厂都有自己的难题，大讨论就要集中力量攻克难题。手表三厂的难题是，公司要他们追加9万只出口表的新任务。多出口一只表，工厂要少收入8—10元，职工愿不愿承担这个损失？通过大讨论，职工们说：“企业有困难，国家困难更大，我们宁可损失一些，也要为国家多创汇。”
    钟表行业这场大讨论也促进了厂风的转变。有的厂的干部开始到车间劳动，有的厂对群众关心的住房分配和食堂改进问题，努力抓紧解决。中国钟厂最近为安装新生产线清理场地，由于党员带头干，过去要一个月才能完成的工程，现在10天就完成了，大家一分钱也不要。
    大讨论带来了新成果。钟表公司领导满怀信心地说，今年预计手表可以实现满产满销，出口任务可以提前超额完成。
    这场大讨论的冲击波正在波及上海各行各业。轻工业局党委号召企市轻工系统企业都来开展这场大讨论。纺织系统24家先进企业联名发表倡议书，希望在全市纺织系统展开大讨论。科技战线提出“经济有困难，科技怎么办？”一支支科技小分队正在深入企业，让科技优势在克服经济困难中发挥作用。
    上海郊区广大农村目前也正在进一步开展建功立业活动，讨论明年如何为家乡创新立业的计划。
