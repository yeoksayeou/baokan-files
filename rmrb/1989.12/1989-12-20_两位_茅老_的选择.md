Two "Old Masters" of the name Mao, Mao Dun and Mao Yisheng, one lived to the age of 85, the other to 94; one is a renowned literary giant known both in China and abroad, the other a world-famous bridge engineer. Although the two old men pursued different professions and had distinct life experiences, they made the same choice in their later years: In March 1981, shortly before his death, Mao Dun wrote to the Central Committee of the Party requesting to join the Party, and the Central Committee decided to restore his Party membership; in 1985, Old Master Mao Yisheng wrote an application to join the Party, and in October 1987, he was approved to join the Communist Party of China.

The choices made by the two old men were not accidental. They chose to join the Party as their lifelong goal because, through their long and winding life journeys, they explored, observed, and analyzed various social systems, theoretical frameworks, political parties, and social realities. They finally came to believe that "only the Communist Party can save China" and that the "Communist Party is the chief engineer in building a new China" (Mao Yisheng's words). There are many more examples like these two old men. This shows that our Party has a powerful appeal and attraction.

Indeed, due to various complex reasons, the Party's policies and guidelines have had some mistakes, and there are corrupt elements within the Party, which to some extent have lowered the Party's prestige and damaged its image. However, the Party is brave enough to admit its mistakes and shortcomings and is resolute in fighting against corruption within its ranks. The facts have proven that the Communist Party of China is the only party that has the qualifications and ability to lead the Chinese people in building socialism. I believe that when each person, especially every young comrade, establishes their beliefs and chooses their path, they should take a look at the life journeys of the two old masters Mao. That is a very beneficial "textbook" for life.

    两位“茅老”的选择
    薛涛
    茅盾、茅以升两位老人，一个享年85岁，一个享年94岁；一个是享誉中外的文学泰斗，一个是中外驰名的桥梁专家。尽管两位老人所从事的职业迥异，人生经历各有曲折，然而，他们在晚年却作出了同样的选择：1981年3月14日茅盾在临终前不久给党中央写信提出入党请求，党中央决定恢复他的党籍；1985年茅以升老人写了入党申请书，1987年10月22日被批准加入中国共产党。
    两位老人的选择不是偶然的。他们之所以把入党作为自己的奋斗目标，是因为他们在漫长而曲折的人生道路上，通过对各种社会制度、理论体系、党派团体以及社会现实等的探索、观察、分析，终于坚信“只有共产党才能救中国”，坚信“共产党是建设新中国的总工程师”（茅以升语）。像两位老人这样的例子还很多。这说明：我们的党是具有强大的感召力和吸引力的。
    诚然，由于各种复杂的原因，党的方针政策出现过某些失误，党内还存在着腐败现象，这在一定程度上降低了党的威信，损害了党的形象，但是，党勇于承认失误和不足，坚决同自己内部的腐败现象进行斗争。事实证明：中国共产党是唯一有资格、有能力领导我国人民建设社会主义的党。我以为，每个人特别是每个青年同志在确立自己的信仰、选择自己的道路时，不妨看看两位茅老的人生之路，那是极其有益的人生“教科书”。
