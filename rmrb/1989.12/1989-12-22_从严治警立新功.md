On November 23 of this year, the Datong Railway Public Security Bureau achieved the milestone of 2,000 days without any disciplinary violations by its officers. To commend the bureau's achievements in strictly governing the police, the Ministry of Public Security of the Ministry of Railways recently awarded the bureau a second-class merit citation. The Beijing Railway Bureau conferred the title of "Civilized Unit" model on the bureau and awarded it a collective merit citation.

The Datong Railway Public Security Bureau has over 700 officers, dispersed across more than 900 kilometers of railway lines, 89 stations, and 13 passenger trains. To enhance the quality of service to the people by all officers, the bureau adheres to the policy of strict governance. It ensures that "the party and government jointly manage the team, and both superiors and subordinates correct the two winds (police conduct and party conduct)," focusing on strictly disciplining, educating, managing, and training the officers. This has cultivated a team of officers who are steadfast in their principles, disciplined, and have a strong work ethic. In recent years, all officers in the bureau have successfully completed various tasks such as investigation and case solving, public security rectification, ensuring the safety of railway transportation and production, and the external transportation of Shanxi coal. They have been commended by higher authorities multiple times.

Facing increasingly heavy tasks, the Party Committee of the Datong Railway Bureau requires all officers to be honest and self-disciplined, and to be loyal to their duties. In the face-to-face struggle against various illegal and criminal activities, they strictly enforce the law and implement the slogan of serving the people in their actual work. All officers of the Huairen Station Sub-bureau, to ensure the safety of passengers' lives and property and the safety of railway transportation, have been enduring wind and rain for years, maintaining day and night patrols, and have won the praise of the masses.

Since the nationwide campaign to eradicate the "six evils" began, this bureau, from the headquarters to the sub-bureaus, from stations and trains to the line defense network, has meticulously organized forces and taken strict measures to severely crack down on the "six evils." On November 14, the Yanggao Station Sub-bureau's on-duty police officer Han Jinyou discovered suspicious clues. After thorough investigation and interrogation, he busted a human trafficking gang, and eight suspects were apprehended on the spot.

    从严治警立新功
    刘自承　刘春生
    今年十一月二十三日，是大同铁路公安分局实现二千天干警无违纪的日子。为表彰这个分局从严治警所取得的成绩，最近，铁道部公安局为这个分局荣记二等功，北京铁路局授予该分局“文明单位”标兵称号，并记集体功一次。
    大同铁路公安分局有七百多名干警，分散在九百多公里线路、八十九个车站和十三对旅客列车上。为提高全体干警为人民服务的质量，分局坚持从严治警的方针。坚持做到“党政一齐抓队伍，上下共同正两风（警风、党风）”，从狠抓干警队伍的纪律作风入手，严格教育，严格管理，严格纪律，严格训练，培养了一支立场坚定、纪律严明、作风过硬的干警队伍。这几年，全局干警圆满完成了侦察破案、整顿治安、保卫铁路运输生产安全和晋煤外运等各项任务，多次受到上级部门的表彰。
    面对越来越繁重的任务，大同铁路分局的党委要求全体干警廉洁自律，忠于职守，在同各种违法犯罪行为进行面对面的斗争中，严格执法，把为人民服务的口号落实到实际工作中。这个分局怀仁站派出所全体干警，为确保旅客生命财产和铁路运输的安全，长年风餐露宿，坚持昼夜巡逻，赢得了群众的称赞。
    全国扫除“六害”的工作开展以来，这个分局从机关到派出所，从站、车到沿线联防网络，精心组织力量，采取严格的措施，狠狠打击“六害”。十一月十四日，阳高站派出所值勤民警韩金尤，发现可疑线索，经他严查细审，破获了一个拐卖妇女的团伙，八名案犯被当场抓获。
