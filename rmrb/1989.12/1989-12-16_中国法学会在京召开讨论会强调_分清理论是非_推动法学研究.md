	Chinese Society of Law Holds Symposium in Beijing Emphasizing Distinguishing Between Theoretical Right and Wrong to Promote Legal Studies

	BEIJING, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on "Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Promoting Legal Theory" was held in Beijing from Dec. 12 to 15. Over 100 law professors and experts from across the country attended the meeting.

	During the discussions, scholars agreed that the influence of bourgeois liberalization in the field of legal studies cannot be underestimated and must be resolutely opposed. At the same time, they recognized the need to be scientific and objective, and to criticize bourgeois liberalization appropriately.

	One of the key manifestations of bourgeois liberalization in legal studies is the denial of the guiding role of Marxist legal theory in China. The attendees felt strongly that to promote socialist legal studies in China, it is essential to systematically study and research the legal theories in the works of Marx and Engels, and to master the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and methodology.

	After heated discussions, the attending legal scholars reached a consensus: to promote socialist legal studies in China, it is necessary to adhere to and implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." It is important to encourage legal educators and researchers to continue to emancipate their minds, explore boldly, and engage in free and open academic discussions and debates. This will help distinguish between theoretical right and wrong, seek scientific truths, and promote socialist legal studies in China. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent those who adhere to bourgeois liberalization from using the "hundred flowers and hundred schools" policy to spread bourgeois liberalization, ensuring that the socialist nature of the policy is not distorted and that it truly plays a role in promoting socialist scientific and cultural undertakings.

	President of the Supreme People's Court Ren Jianxin, Minister of Justice Cai Cheng, and President of the Chinese Society of Law Wang Zhongfang attended the opening ceremony.

    中国法学会在京召开讨论会强调
    分清理论是非　推动法学研究
    本报北京12月15日讯　记者王礼明报道：12月12日至15日，中国法学会在京召开“坚持四项基本原则与繁荣法学理论讨论会”。来自全国各地的100多名法学教授、专家出席了会议。
    在讨论过程中，学者们认为，资产阶级自由化思想在法学领域的影响不可低估，必须旗帜鲜明地加以反对。同时，大家也认识到，要搞好对资产阶级自由化的批判，还要注意讲究科学，实事求是，恰如其分。
    资产阶级自由化在法学领域的一个重要表现，是否定马克思主义法学在我国法学领域的指导地位。与会学者们深深感到，要繁荣我国社会主义法学，非常需要系统学习和钻研马恩原著中有关法学的论述，掌握马克思主义的立场、观点、方法。
    经过热烈讨论，与会法学家们还取得一个共识：就是要繁荣我国社会主义法学，必须坚持和贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，要鼓励法学教学和研究人员继续解放思想，大胆探索，开展同志式的自由讨论和学术争鸣，分清理论是非，探求科学真理，繁荣我国社会主义法学；同时，也要防止那些坚持资产阶级自由化的人利用“双百”方针来散布资产阶级自由化的言论，从而保证“双百”方针的社会主义性质不被篡改，真正发挥繁荣社会主义科学文化事业的作用。
    最高人民法院院长任建新、司法部部长蔡诚、中国法学会会长王仲方出席了会议开幕式。
