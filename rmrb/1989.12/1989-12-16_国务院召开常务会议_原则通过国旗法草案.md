The State Council held its 52nd executive meeting this morning, presided over by Premier Li Peng. The meeting discussed and principally approved the draft of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the National Flag," deciding to submit this draft law to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

The meeting believed that the national flag of the People's Republic of China is a symbol of the state and a symbol of the great unity of all nationalities. Every citizen and organization should respect and cherish the national flag. To maintain the sovereignty and dignity of the state and to strengthen citizens' sense of national identity and patriotism, it is necessary to enact a national flag law.

The draft law stipulates that the national flag of the People's Republic of China is the five-star red flag.

The draft consists of 13 articles, covering the scope of hoisting the national flag, the time for hoisting and lowering the national flag, the circumstances under which the flag should be flown at half-mast, and the penalties for violations of the national flag law.

Eight members of the State Council's executive meeting attended today's meeting, while six were absent due to leave.
