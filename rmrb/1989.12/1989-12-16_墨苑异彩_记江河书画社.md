In a secluded, tree-lined corner within a military compound in the western suburbs of Beijing, there is a small cultural study, a recreational cultural haven for the staff of a certain communications bureau under the General Staff Department. Upon entering, one sees a plaque with the inscription "Jianghe Calligraphy and Painting Society" written by Wang Xujiu hanging on the main wall. The walls of the two interconnected rooms, each less than 50 square meters, are adorned with works by renowned domestic calligraphers and painters. It is evident that masters such as Bai Xueshi, Tian Shiguang, and Xu Linlu have visited here multiple times. It is understood that Wang Xueya and Li Tao have also been invited as consultants for the society. During the society's annual meetings, many consultants and other enthusiastic calligraphy and painting enthusiasts are always eager to come and provide guidance, often leaving behind their finest works for the society and the troops.

From the introduction, it is known that the cultural life of this communications bureau is quite active. Amidst the hectic work, many officers and soldiers regard the pursuit of art as a way to enrich their lives. This pursuit not only broadens their cultural horizons but also deepens their understanding of society and life. Moreover, by studying calligraphy and painting, a unique aspect of traditional Chinese culture, they can experience the vastness of the artistic realm and subtly absorb the influence of national culture and patriotism.

Practicing calligraphy and painting has also paved a path to success for the officers and soldiers. To meet the needs of social development and the growth of the troops, three years ago, a few officers and soldiers who loved calligraphy and painting established the society, naming it "Jianghe" to signify drawing inspiration from the rivers and seas. Over the past three years, the society has held numerous calligraphy and painting lectures, pen meetings, and art exhibitions, forging ties with the calligraphy and painting community and continuously enriching their vision and skills. The troops' amateur calligraphy and painting enthusiasts have taken advantage of these rare learning opportunities to seek guidance from masters and diligently pursue their art. During my visit to the society, I encountered Liu Zhanjiang, a painter from the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy, who was giving a lesson. Several young people were attentively learning from him. It is thanks to the guidance of these calligraphy and painting masters that many cultural elites have emerged. As members of the society, their works are displayed in the troops' cultural and entertainment centers, company clubs, meeting rooms, dining halls, and auditoriums, decorating the military camp and beautifying the soldiers' minds. Some of these works, imbued with the scent of their hometowns and the spirit of communication soldiers, have participated in national and military-level calligraphy and painting exhibitions and have won numerous awards. Many works have been published in art magazines and newspapers; over a hundred selected works by members, after being mounted, have been presented as gifts to international and Hong Kong-Macao friends. The society has also trained batches of soldier amateur picture framers, enabling them to learn and succeed in their spare time.

Now, the society's works are no longer limited to Chinese painting and calligraphy. Woodcut, decorative painting, photography, oil painting, and hard-pen calligraphy creations have also entered the society, and the amateur cultural and artistic realm of the officers and soldiers is gradually expanding.

    墨苑异彩
    ——记江河书画社
    江海平
    位于北京西郊某军事机关院内一处幽静的林荫僻处，有个小小的文化书斋，这是总参谋部某通信总站机关的一所业余文化园地。推门而入，王遐举题写的“江河书画社”匾额横悬正墙，不足50平方米的两间套房墙壁上，挂满了国内著名书画家的手迹。可以看出白雪石、田世光、许麟庐等书画家都曾多次亲临这里。据了解，王雪崖、李铎等还被书画社聘为顾问，每逢社里年会，不少顾问及其他一些热忱的书画名人，总是高兴地应邀前来指导，并每每为书画社及部队官兵留下得意之作。
    从介绍得知，目前，这个通信总站的文化生活十分活跃，紧张繁忙的工作之余，许多官兵把对艺术的探求看作是生活中的一种调剂，这种调剂不仅拓宽了大家的文化视野，而且使年轻的军官士兵们对社会与人生的理解更有深度。而且，他们学习书画艺术这一特有的中国传统文化，可以体验那博大的意境、神韵，潜移默化地接受民族文化和爱国主义熏陶。
    练书学画也给官兵铺垫了一条成才之路。为了适应社会发展和官兵成才的需要，这个部队在领导的热情支持下，三年前由几名爱好书画艺术的干部战士办起了书画社，他们以“江河”为社名，寓意博采江河之灵。三年来，书画社多次举办书画讲座、笔会、美术评展，与书画界结下了笔墨之缘，不断丰富自己的眼界和技艺。部队的业余书画爱好者利用这些难得的学习机会，求教名师，孜孜学艺。在我参观书画社时，就碰上常来这里讲学的北京国画院画家刘占江，围在他身边的几位青年人正在悉心求艺。正是得益于书画家们的指点，许多文化骨干脱颖而出。作为书画社的会员，他们的作品布置在部队文化娱乐活动中心和连队俱乐部以及会议室、饭厅、礼堂等处，装饰了军营环境，美化着官兵心灵。其中，部分作品还夹带着家乡泥土的芳香与通信战士的情怀，参加了全国全军以及上级机关举办的书法绘画展览，并多次获奖；不少作品刊登在画报、杂志上面；还有百十幅精选出来的会员作品在装裱之后，作为礼品送赠国际和港澳友人。书画社还培养了一批批战士业余裱画师，使他们利用余暇学艺成才。
    现在，书画社的作品已不限于中国画和毛笔书法，版画、装饰画、摄影、油画、硬笔书法等创作也走进书画社，官兵业余文化艺术的天地正在一步步地拓宽。
