    On the Road
    Liú Wēi

    Off comes the shiny leather jacket
    On goes the greasy work uniform
    A lunchbox in hand
    Filled with the love of wife and children
    Down the long, sloping iron ladder
    Towards the horizon—on the road

    The green lights ahead are like flirtatious eyes
    Luring the dragon towards the distant horizon
    Passing the junction of history and future
    Passing the intersection of hope and conflict
    On the locomotive, you read the silent night sky
    Only the mid-autumn moon accompanies you
    Opening the lunchbox
    Taking big bites
    During the time when one misses family the most
    The roaring whistle
    Turns into the murmurs of wife and children
    Written silently in the heart

    出车
    刘巍
    脱下亮闪闪的皮茄克
    套上油腻腻的工作服
    拎着腰子饭盒
    里面盛满妻儿的思念
    沿着伏地的长铁梯
    通向天边——出车
    前方绿灯如媚眼
    引诱着龙扑向遥远
    驶过历史和未来的道岔口
    驶过希望和矛盾的交织点
    你在车头上朗读静静的夜空
    唯有中秋月与你同行
    打开腰子饭盒
    大口大口地咀嚼
    每逢佳节倍思亲的时刻
    奔腾的汽笛
    化为妻儿的梦呓
    默写在心里
