One rundown Palestinian refugee village after another, faces etched with the scars of war, and the winding anti-tank trenches, tanks covered with tarps, and artillery hidden in the hills and forests... all these scenes flashed by. On November 16th, under the guidance of Lieutenant General Radolf, the commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, we arrived at the ancient city of Quneitra, the forwardmost outpost of the Israeli-occupied area on the Golan Heights, a territory of Syria.

In June 1974, after the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force was stationed on the Golan Heights front line, a "buffer zone" (also known as the "separation zone") was established along the 1967 ceasefire line, separating the Syrian and Israeli armies. This buffer zone is a narrow strip running north-south, 80 kilometers long, extending from Lebanon in the north to Jordan in the south.

The buffer zone has prevented direct confrontations between the Syrian and Israeli armies, but it has also cut off communication between the Syrian people. On the western side of the buffer zone, the Israeli occupying forces have built a solid fence, attempting to make it a permanent border and to occupy the Golan Heights forever. An Austrian young officer told us a story: Not far from Quneitra, there is a Jewish village called Hadar, and on the other side of the buffer zone, there is a village called Majd al-Shams. For centuries, the two villages have had frequent exchanges and intermarriages, living harmoniously together, and have long been considered "sister villages." Now, war has made it difficult for relatives to meet, even though they are so close. Only with the special arrangements of the Syrian police and the United Nations forces can the villagers occasionally reunite.

After finishing a typical Finnish lunch—pea and beef soup with toasted bread—at the Finnish camp, we set off towards the 58th United Nations observation post. This is the southernmost United Nations observation post on the Syrian side of the buffer zone, located on a hillside about 400-500 meters above sea level.

The observation post is manned by two soldiers from Sweden and the Netherlands. They take turns day and night, constantly observing the buffer zone boundary line in the valley below. If they detect any violations, they immediately report to the Finnish camp and regularly submit observation reports to the headquarters. Their lives are extremely difficult: the highest temperature here can reach 50°C, they use kerosene stoves, and drink stored water. When I saw that their 15-day food supply consisted entirely of bagged bread and canned goods, I felt a deep respect for the two soldiers. They are far from their families, sacrificing comfortable lives, coming to this wilderness, and working tirelessly day and night on simple yet arduous tasks to maintain peace in this region.

However, this peace is relative. The Arab people, in their struggle for national self-determination and to reclaim their lost lands, have never stopped fighting against the Israeli authorities. This will be a long and arduous struggle. Under the guidance of the observers, I used a high-powered telescope to look towards the Israeli-occupied area, and the Israeli flag hanging over the Israeli military base immediately came into view. Behind the observation post, just a few hundred meters away, there was a Syrian military outpost. I gazed at the "Old Man Mountain," over 2,000 meters high, and fell into deep thought: When will this tense standoff end? When will the Syrian people reclaim the Golan Heights? I hope that day will come soon, and I hope that this place will remain peaceful forever.

    愿这里永远平静
    ——访戈兰高地缓冲区
    朱民和
    一个个破旧不堪的巴勒斯坦难民村，一张张刻有战争创伤印记的面容，还有那蜿蜒的防坦克壕，盖着油布的坦克，隐蔽在山坡丛林中的火炮眼……在视线中一一掠过。11月16日，我们在联合国脱离接触观察部队司令拉道夫少将的带领下，来到了叙利亚领土戈兰高地以色列军占领区最前哨的古城萨萨。
    1974年6月，联合国脱离接触观察部队进驻戈兰高地前线后，以1967年停火线为界设立了“隔离区”（即缓冲区），使叙、以两军脱离了接触。隔离区为一南北走向的狭长地带，长80公里，北至黎巴嫩，南抵约旦。
    隔离区使叙、以两军脱离正面接触，但叙利亚人民的交流也受到阻隔。在隔离区西侧，以色列占领军已修筑起一道坚固的围栏，试图以此为国界，永远占领戈兰高地。一位奥地利年青军官给我们讲了这样一个故事：在离萨萨城不远处有一个名为哈达尔的犹太村，而隔离区另一侧有个马贾桑尼村，数百年来，两村交往不断，通婚频繁，和睦相处，早已是一对“姐妹村”。而今，战争却使亲人咫尺天涯，难以相见。只有在叙利亚警察、联合国部队的专门安排下，两村百姓才能偶尔团聚。
    在芬兰营吃完了一顿典型的芬兰式午餐——豌豆牛肉汤加烤面包，我们踏上了前往58号联合国观察哨的路途。这是隔离区叙军一侧最南端的联合国观察哨，设在海拔四、五百米高的山坡上。
    观察哨由两位来自瑞典和荷兰的军人驻守。他们不分昼夜，轮流上岗，时刻观察着峡谷深处的隔离区分界线，发现逾越情况，即向芬兰营报告，并定期写出观察报告，上呈司令部。他们的生活异常艰苦：这里最高气温可达50℃，用的是煤油炉，喝的是储存水。目睹他们15天的食品储备竟全是袋装面包和罐头时，我对两位军人油然产生了一股敬意。他们远离亲人，牺牲舒适的生活，来到这荒山野岭，夜以继日地重复着简单而又艰巨的工作，维护着这一地区的平静。
    然而，平静是相对的。阿拉伯人民为了争取民族自决，收复失地，同以色列当局的斗争从未间断过。这将是一场旷日持久，艰苦卓绝的斗争。在观察员的指点下，我用高倍望远镜朝以军占领区眺望，悬挂着以色列旗的以军驻地赫然扑入眼帘。而在观察哨后面数百米处，就有一个叙军哨所。我远眺着2000多米高的“老头山”，陷入了沉思：这种平静后面的紧张对峙何时才会结束？叙利亚人民何日才能收复戈兰高地？但愿这一天早日到来，但愿这里永远平静。
