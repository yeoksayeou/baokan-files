Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th.

Master of Chinese painting Li Keran, who had dedicated nearly 70 years to the art world, passed away today. He will be remembered for his countless artistic masterpieces.

At 10:50 AM, Li Keran suddenly succumbed to a heart attack in his Beijing residence while discussing plans to promote and elevate Chinese painting with four colleagues from the Ministry of Culture. He was 82 years old.

Li Keran entered the world of art at the age of 13 and dedicated his life to mastering his craft, eventually becoming a renowned master. He named his studio "Shi Niu Tang" (Studio of the Ox), often comparing himself to an old ox, diligent and hardworking. His painting "Five Oxen" bears the inscription: "The ox, with boundless strength, bows its head to serve without boasting. It toils all its life, serving others and taking no credit..." Many of his fellow artists saw this as a reflection of Li Keran's own character.

As an outstanding art educator, Li Keran nurtured generation after generation of talented artists. His artistic cultivation, creative thinking, and moral integrity influenced a great many artists.

As a highly respected master, he served for many years as the vice-chairman of the Chinese Artists Association and the director of the Chinese Painting Research Institute. He was also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for several terms.

Even in his later years, despite suffering from severe heart disease, his passion for art remained unwavering. He continued to receive visitors seeking his guidance, create paintings that celebrated the beauty of the land, and attend art exhibitions with the aid of a cane.

Today, he had planned to meet with overseas friends in the afternoon to discuss promoting cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait. However, he passed away unexpectedly, leaving behind many unfulfilled wishes and invaluable legacies.

    中国画一代宗师
    李可染先生逝世
    新华社北京12月5日电  （记者尹鸿祝）在中国画坛辛勤耕耘了近70年的一代宗师李可染先生，今天永久地放下了他那曾创造出数以万计的艺术珍品的画笔。
    上午10时50分，因心脏病猝发，李可染在北京自己的寓所里溘然长逝，享年82岁。
    当时，他正在画室里，同文化部的4位同志商讨如何发扬光大中国画艺术。构想刚刚谈开，他却突然头一偏，仰靠在了沙发背上，再也没有抬起来。
    从13岁步入艺术殿堂，李可染始终孜孜以求，造诣日深，终成一代大师。
    他为自己的画室取名“师牛堂”，常以老黄牛精神自励。他曾在画作《五牛图》上题字道：“牛也，力大无穷，俯首孺子而不逞强。终生劳瘁，事人而安不居功……”他的不少画友说，这也可以看作是李可染先生自身的写照。
    作为杰出的美术教育家，李可染几十年间培育了一批又一批优秀的美术人才。他的艺术修养、创作思想、品德情操，都影响了一大批美术家。
    作为一位德高望重的艺术大师，他生前担任了多年的中国美术家协会副主席、中国画研究院院长。他还是连续几届的全国政协委员。
    晚年，尽管患有严重的心脏病，可他那颗献身艺术之心始终在顽强地跳动。他仍然不断地接待前来求教的人们，仍然挥笔创造着一幅幅赞颂大好山河的佳作，仍然拄着拐杖参观美术展览……
    在今天的勒程表上，他计划下午接待海外友人，商讨促进海峡两岸文化交流。可他突然离去了，留下许多美好的愿望，留下许多宝贵的财富。
