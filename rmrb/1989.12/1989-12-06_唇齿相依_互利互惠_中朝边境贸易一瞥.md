**Interdependent and Mutually Beneficial – A Glimpse into Sino-North Korean Border Trade**

By Xú Bǎokāng, People's Daily Correspondent

The mountains and rivers of China and North Korea connect, with a land border of over 1,300 kilometers. The two countries have a long history of border trade, which has developed rapidly and become increasingly active in recent years.

Recently, the reporter visited North Korea's Hamgyeongbuk-do and China's bordering Yanbian region, witnessing the thriving development of border trade between the two countries.

Driving north from the North Korean port city of Chongjin for about 70 kilometers, one arrives at Samheung Town, one of the border trade ports between China and North Korea. The town is bustling with activity, with vehicles and people moving in all directions. Trucks loaded with various goods destined for North Korea, such as bed sheets, table lamps, soap, and paint, are seen everywhere. Refrigerated trucks from the North Korean Hwaryong port carry boxes of mackerel and crabs, which are popular among the ethnic minorities in Yanbian. After a flurry of activity by customs and plant and animal inspection personnel from both sides, they wave and let the trucks pass. A Chinese customs official said, "It's like visiting relatives every day." Kim Bong-uk, Vice Chairman of the Administrative and Economic Guidance Committee of Hamgyeongbuk-do, excitedly told the reporter that the trade volume between the province and Yanbian has increased more than tenfold in six years, reaching six million Swiss francs last year. The variety of goods has also expanded from the initial dozen or so to over 140.

Hamgyeongbuk-do and Yanbian established equal and mutually beneficial border trade relations as early as 1954. The expansion of border trade has not only strengthened the friendship between the two countries but also played a positive role in the economic development and improvement of living standards for both sides.

The ethnic minorities in Yanbian love to eat mackerel, but since the region is landlocked, it is difficult to meet the demand. Hamgyeongbuk-do, on the other hand, is a coastal area rich in mackerel. After negotiations, the North Korean side provides mackerel to China, while China exports daily necessities to North Korea, satisfying both sides. The Kimchaek Steel Complex, the largest steel plant in Hamgyeongbuk-do, produces tens of thousands of tons of slag annually, which is difficult to dispose of and piles up like mountains. This slag is exactly what the cement industry in Yanbian needs as an additive, so the two sides signed a contract to turn waste into treasure. North Korean comrades praise the quality of benzoic acid diester and paint imported from China, and the plastic products and various types of furniture produced from these chemical raw materials are popular among North Korean consumers.

To further develop border trade and ensure a sufficient supply of goods, Hamgyeongbuk-do has taken a series of measures in recent years. The province has established 14 export bases, including marble, slag, silk, and shallow-sea aquaculture, based on the advantages of each county. It also plans to expand the road from Chongjin to Hwaryong port in the near future to meet the needs of increased trade transportation. Chen Hengsan, Director of the Yanbian Foreign Economic and Trade Commission, introduced that the border trade situation has been favorable in recent years, with the trade volume reaching only 1.03 million Swiss francs in 1982, exceeding 100 million last year, and already surpassing 100 million in the first nine months of this year. Based on the rapid development of border trade, the two sides have begun to develop towards cooperation and joint ventures.

Currently, the two sides have started cooperation in four projects: knitted products, cosmetics, vise processing, and seafood processing. Vise processing and seafood processing have already achieved initial results, and it is believed that the future development prospects will be even broader.

    唇齿相依  互利互惠
    ——中朝边境贸易一瞥
    本报记者　徐宝康
    中朝两国山接山，水连水，大陆疆界达一千三百多公里。两国边境贸易有悠久历史，近年来发展迅速，日趋活跃。
    最近，记者访问了朝鲜咸镜北道以及我国与朝鲜接壤的延边地区，所见所闻，可以说是两国边境贸易蓬勃发展的缩影。
    驱车出朝鲜港口城市清津向北行驶七十多公里，便到了我国对朝边境贸易口岸之一的三合镇。这里车水马龙，一派繁忙景象。一辆辆新式解放牌大卡车满载着输往朝鲜的各种商品：被面、床单、台灯、肥皂、油漆……从朝鲜会宁口岸驶过来的冷藏车里装满了延边兄弟民族喜爱的明太鱼、海螃蟹……双方各自海关、动植物检验人员一阵忙碌后，微笑着举手敬礼放行。中国一位海关人员说，这里每天都像走亲戚一样热闹。朝鲜咸镜北道行政经济指导委员会副委员长金峰乙兴奋地告诉记者，仅该道同延边地区的贸易额六年内就增长了十多倍，去年达六百万瑞士法郎，商品的品种也由最初的十几种，发展到目前的一百四十余种。
    朝鲜咸镜北道与我延边地区早在一九五四年就建立了平等互利的边境贸易联系。边境贸易的日益扩大不仅巩固和加强了两国友谊，而且对双方的经济发展和人民生活水平的提高起到了良好作用。
    我延边地区的兄弟民族十分喜欢吃明太鱼，但因地处内陆无法满足需求，而朝鲜咸镜北道恰好是沿海地区，盛产明太鱼。双方经过协商，朝方向我提供明太鱼，中方则向朝方输出日用品，互通有无，双方满意。金策钢铁联合企业是咸镜北道最大的钢铁厂，每年都有数万吨炼完钢后的废矿渣难于处置，堆积如山。而这种矿渣正是延边水泥工业需要的添加剂，于是双方签订合同，变废为宝。朝鲜同志称赞从中国进口的苯二甲酸二辛酯以及油漆涂料质量好，用这些化工原料生产出来的塑料制品和各式家具，深受朝鲜消费者欢迎。
    为进一步发展边境贸易，保证充足货源，朝鲜咸镜北道近年来采取了一系列措施。这个道根据各郡的优势，分别筹建了大理石、矿渣、丝绸、浅海养殖等十四个出口基地，并计划在近期内扩建清津至会宁口岸的公路，以适应扩大贸易运输的需要。我国延边对外经济贸易委员会主任陈亨三介绍说，近几年边贸发展形势喜人，一九八二年贸易额只有一百零三万瑞士法郎，去年就超过一亿，今年头九个月已超过了一亿。在边境贸易迅速发展的基础上，去年双方已向合作、合营方向发展。
    目前，双方已在针织品、化妆品、台钳加工和海产品加工四个项目上开始合作，台钳和海产品加工已取得初步成效，相信今后发展前景更加广阔。
