A spokesperson for the relevant Swiss authorities stated on the 27th in Geneva that the Swiss government recently returned a deposit of 3.25 million Swiss francs, which former Philippine President Marcos had placed in a Geneva bank in 1986, to the Philippines.

Three years ago, the Swiss government froze Marcos' deposits in Swiss banks at the request of the Philippine government. In March of this year, Switzerland also handed over relevant documents regarding Marcos' deposits to the Philippine judicial authorities.

It is estimated that Marcos had deposits totaling 600 million US dollars in Switzerland.

    瑞士把马科斯部分存款归还菲
    瑞士有关部门发言人27日在日内瓦对报界说，瑞士政府最近向菲律宾归还了菲前总统马科斯1986年存入日内瓦银行的一笔325万瑞士法郎的存款。
    瑞士政府在3年前应菲律宾政府的要求冻结了马科斯在瑞士银行的存款。今年3月，瑞士又把有关马科斯存款的资料交给了菲律宾司法机构。
    据估计，马科斯在瑞士的存款达6亿美元。
