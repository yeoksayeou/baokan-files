Chairman Yang Shangkun today morning visited with great interest the Royal Jewelry Museum, the Greco-Roman Museum, and the Ancient Roman Theater in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city.

The Jewelry Museum displays various rare treasures and exquisite artifacts collected and preserved by the ruling family of the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali. Chairman Yang inquired about the history and value of the exhibits with keen interest.

The Greco-Roman Museum is one of Egypt's four major museums, exhibiting approximately 40,000 items from the Greek and Roman rule over Egypt, spanning from the 3rd century BC to the 7th century AD. These items include stone carvings, ceramics, mummies, and other various artifacts.

The Ancient Roman Theater was built in the 2nd century BC and is semi-circular with 12 tiers of marble seating. The theater has excellent acoustics. After testing the acoustics, Chairman Yang remarked, "This is a bit like the Echo Wall in Beijing's Temple of Heaven."

State Councilor and Minister of Finance Wang Bingqian accompanied the visit.

Those who accompanied Chairman Yang on his visit included the head of the Egyptian delegation, Minister of Industry Muhammad Abdul Wahab, Governor of Alexandria Province Sayyid Ismail Joushi, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Zhan Shiliang, and Chinese Consul-General in Alexandria Wu Decheng.

Chairman Yang and his entourage arrived in Cairo on December 18 to begin their official friendly visit to Egypt. On December 21, he left Cairo for Alexandria to continue his visit. Upon his arrival at the Montazah Palace, where he was staying, he was welcomed by the Governor of Alexandria Province, Joushi.

    新华社亚历山大12月22日电　（记者李思治）杨尚昆主席今天上午饶有兴味地参观了埃及第二大城市亚历山大的皇家珍宝馆、希腊—罗马博物馆和古罗马剧场。
    珍宝馆展出了奥斯曼帝国时期的统治者穆罕默德·阿里家族收集并珍藏的各种稀世瑰宝和精美华贵的工艺品。杨主席边看边询问其历史和价值，趣味盎然。
    希腊—罗马博物馆是埃及的4大博物馆之一，展出约4万件从公元前三世纪到公元七世纪希腊和罗马统治埃及时期的各种石雕、瓷器以及木乃伊和其它各种文物。
    古罗马剧场建于公元前二世纪，呈半圆形，有12层大理石阶梯的观众席。剧场有很好的回音效果。杨主席在试验后说，“这有点像北京天坛的回音壁。”
    国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾等随同参观。
    陪同杨主席参观的有埃方陪同团团长、工业部长穆罕默德·阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜、亚历山大省省长赛义德·伊斯梅尔·乔斯奇、中国驻埃及大使詹世亮和中国驻亚历山大总领事吴德成。
