The Communist Youth League of China is the mass organization of China's advanced youth. To date, it has over 56 million members and 149,200 grassroots committees. The Youth League, as the assistant and reserve force of the Party, has played an important role in the reform and opening up.

However, in recent years, the work of the Youth League has exposed many problems. In the new situation, how to do a good job in the work of the Youth League? This article explores some ways to strengthen the organizational construction of the Youth League.

The reform and opening up have brought many new characteristics and new problems to the construction of the Youth League. Over the past 10 years, it has been clear that how the role of the Youth League organization is played has a great relationship with the construction of the two civilizations and the growth of youth.

In March 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued the "Decision on Carrying Out the Activity of Striving to Be a New Long March Pioneer Among All Youth in the Country." Over the past 10 years, the ranks of the New Long March Pioneers, this group of young heroes, have developed into a mighty army of hundreds of thousands. Facing the increasingly deepening economic system reform, according to the imbalance of economic development and talent characteristics between the eastern and western regions of China, the "mutual assistance between the east and the west" activity has become a new field of work for the Youth League to serve the reform. In 1985, the Youth League committees of Gansu and Shanghai took the lead in initiating the "economic mutual assistance activity between the east and the west." Through continuous efforts, this activity quickly expanded to more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Sichuan. According to statistics, from 1985 to 1988, through the Youth League's mediation, 971 economic cooperation intentions were reached between the eastern and western regions, 176 projects were implemented or are being implemented, 1,100 technical talents were trained for the west by the east, and 20,000 young people from the west went to the east to learn technology and provide labor services. With the help of the east, a batch of township enterprises in the west have developed rapidly. The "mutual assistance between the east and the west" activity not only provides an opportunity for young people in the east to show their talents but also opens up a new path for poverty alleviation and prosperity in remote areas.

The Youth League organization and the majority of young people are active on the construction sites of the country. They use their advantages in physical and intellectual labor to undertake urgent, difficult, new, and heavy projects, fully playing the role of a shock brigade in national construction.

The Youth League is an indispensable important force in China's reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction. However, due to the weakening of the Party's leadership and ideological and political work in recent years, the organizational construction of the Youth League has also been affected to a certain extent.

Stabilizing the Youth League's cadre team

It is understood that the number of Youth League cadres has been decreasing year by year. Taking Beijing as an example, there were 6,760 full-time Youth League cadres in 1986, 6,596 in 1987, and 5,267 in 1988.

The reasons for the decrease in the number of Youth League cadres are multifaceted. However, from the perspective of the Youth League cadres themselves, there are phenomena of "not being able to come in" and "not being able to go out." "Not being able to come in" means that some capable young people, while the Youth League organization wants to recruit them, they themselves do not want to come; or they want to come, and the Youth League organization also wants them, but due to the cadre system and other reasons, they are restricted. "Not being able to go out" is manifested in the fact that some Youth League cadres are older but are still on the Youth League's post.

The reasonable political and economic treatment of Youth League cadres is often not implemented, and some units often intentionally or unintentionally use Youth League cadres at a half or one level lower because they are young. It is understood that in a certain region of Guangxi, more than 30 full-time Youth League cadres have no treatment level and have become ordinary clerks in reality.

According to the provisions of the Youth League Constitution, its leaders at all levels must be elected through democratic elections. Of course, according to the Party's management principles for the Youth League, the results of democratic elections need to be confirmed by the Party organization. The problem is that some places have not conducted democratic elections or do not respect the election results. It is understood that a certain enterprise in Beijing has not held a Youth League congress for 11 years from 1978 to the present, and Youth League cadres are appointed. Some appointed Youth League cadres, after taking office, mainly consider being responsible to their superiors, neglect being responsible to their subordinates, do not pay attention to reflecting the voices of young people, and protecting the legal rights and interests of young people. Their work methods are to copy the administrative style instead of starting from the characteristics of young people. According to a survey by the urban sampling team of Bengbu City, Anhui Province, 50% of the 100 Youth League members surveyed believe that the Youth League organization has no attraction, of which 74% believe that the Youth League organization life is too dull, and 14% believe that the Youth League cadres have weak abilities.

Reflecting the advanced nature and mass nature of the Youth League organization

The reporter learned that the two shortcomings in the self-construction of the Youth League are not conducive to the education of young people.

First, there is a lack of advanced nature. The Communist Youth League of China is the organization of China's advanced youth. Due to various reasons, the advanced nature of the Communist Youth League has been weakened. Some Youth League cadres and members have not fully played a model role in social life, and even perform very generally, leading many non-Youth League young people to not see the advanced nature of the Youth League and feel that joining or not joining the Youth League is the same.

Second, there is a lack of mass nature. Although the Communist Youth League of China already has 56 million members, the proportion of members to youth is only 21.4%. The low proportion of members, coupled with the fact that a large number of members are engaged in business and go out, leads to young people not being able to find the Youth League organization and not being able to receive the Youth League's education. According to a survey in some places, 33% of 100 young workers expressed unwillingness to join the Youth League, 29% expressed indifference, and only 38% of young workers expressed a willingness to join the Youth League. In many rural areas, the construction of the Youth League does not adapt to the great changes in rural social politics and economy, leading to the paralysis of some grassroots Youth League organizations. Long-term rural Youth League members who work outside cannot participate in Youth League activities and cannot pay membership dues, resulting in a large number of members dropping out of the Youth League on their own.

The Youth League is the organization of the youth masses and must reflect, represent, and safeguard the interests of young people. However, when encountering specific problems in the reform, the Youth League, as the assistant of the Party, can only mobilize young people to support the reform, but is powerless to deal with some practical problems of young people that arise from this. Some members told Youth League cadres: "We don't come to you when we have problems, we can understand the difficulties." Some young people said: "What's the use of coming to you? You don't have bonuses or houses, and there are electronic games and bowling alleys everywhere on the streets. If we want to play, we will go ourselves." These objectively weaken the attraction of the Youth League organization to young people.

The key is the attention of the Party and government organizations

The Youth League is a mass organization under the leadership of the Party. The Party organizations at all levels have the power and responsibility to guide the work of the Youth League, care about the construction of the Youth League, and care about the growth of Youth League cadres. However, it is understood that many Party committees have not formed a special system to study youth work and cannot often or regularly understand the situation of the Youth League and listen to the reports of the Youth League organization.

Article 50 of the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China" stipulates that the secretaries of the Youth League committees at the county level and below, and the secretaries of the Youth League committees of enterprises and institutions, can attend the meetings of the Party committees and standing committees at the same level. This provision has not been well implemented in many places. According to a survey by relevant departments in Beijing, only 22% of the leaders of district, county, and bureau-level Youth League committees are Party committee members, 11% can often attend Party committee meetings, 22% can attend Party committee meetings to study youth work, and 45% have never attended any Party committee meetings. The reporter learned that the main reason is that some grassroots leaders of the Party only regard this as a treatment, rather than truly cultivating and using the Youth League cadres as assistants and reserve forces. Many grassroots leaders of the Party do not understand the provisions of Article 50 of the Party Constitution. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League once conducted a survey and asked about the relationship between the Party and the Youth League. Some grassroots Party cadres could not answer.

Leaders at all levels of the Party and government should often face the grassroots, go among the youth, understand the situation of the youth, listen to the voices of the youth, and directly care about the work of the youth. In addition, leaders at all levels of the Party and government must also put the work of the Youth League in its proper place and pay attention to the training and use of Youth League cadres. Party schools at all levels should also undertake part of the task of training Youth League cadres.

    切实加强共青团的组织建设
    本报记者  傅钉根
    中国共产主义青年团是中国先进青年的群众组织，迄今它已拥有团员五千六百多万名，基层团委十四万九千二百个。共青团作为党的助手和后备军，在改革开放中，发挥了重要作用。
    然而，在团的工作上，近年来也暴露出不少问题。在新的形势下，如何做好团的工作？本文就抓好团的组织建设作了一些探讨。
    ·编者·
    改革开放，给团的建设带来许多新的特点和新的问题。10年来可以清楚看出，团组织作用发挥得如何，对两个文明建设和青年的成长关系很大。
    1979年3月，共青团中央发出《关于在全国青年中开展争当新长征突击手活动的决定》。10年来，新长征突击手这支青年英雄的行列已发展为一支浩浩荡荡的百万大军。面对越来越深入的经济体制改革，根据我国东西部经济发展不平衡和人才特点，“东西互助”活动成为共青团为改革服务的一个新的工作领域。1985年，甘肃、上海两地团委率先发起了“东西部经济互助活动”。经过不断努力，这一活动很快扩展到北京、浙江、贵州、四川等20多个省、市、自治区。据统计，1985年到1988年，经团组织牵线搭桥，东西部共达成经济合作意向971个，已经落实或正在实施的项目176个，东部为西部培训技术人才1100多人，西部向东部输出劳务和送出去学习技术的青年2万人。西部一批乡镇企业在东部的帮助下迅速发展起来。“东西互助”活动既为东部有志青年提供了大显身手的机会，也为偏远地区致富脱贫开辟了一条新路。
    共青团组织和广大青年活跃在国家建设工地上。他们利用自己体力和智力的优势，承担急、难、新、重工程，在国家建设中充分发挥了突击队作用。
    共青团在我国改革开放和社会主义现代化建设中是一支不可缺少的重要力量。但是，由于近几年来，党的领导淡化，思想政治工作削弱，共青团的组织建设因此也受到一定的影响。
    稳定团的干部队伍
    据了解，近几年团的干部数量逐年下降。以北京市为例，1986年共有专职团干部6760人，1987年下降到6596人，1988年则下降到5267人。
    团干部数量下降原因是多方面的。但从团干部自身讲，却存在着“进不来”，“出不去”的现象。“进不来”，一是一些有作为的青年，团组织想吸收他进来，他本人却不愿来；二是本人也想来，团组织也想要，但由于干部制度等原因，又被限制住了。“出不去”则表现为，一些团的干部年龄大了，却还在团的岗位上。
    团干部合理的政治待遇和经济待遇也常常得不到落实，一些单位往往有意无意地将团干部压半格或一格使用，因为他们毕竟年轻。据了解，广西某地区有30多个专职团干部什么待遇级别都没有，实际成为一般的办事员。
    根据团章规定，它的各级领导都要经过民主选举产生。当然，按照党对团的管理原则，民主选举结果需要党组织予以确认。问题在于，有的没有进行民主选举或者不够尊重选举结果。据记者了解，北京有家企业从1978年至今11年中，一直未开过团代会，团干部是任命的。有的被任命的团干部上任以后，主要考虑对上负责，忽视对下负责，不注意反映青年呼声，维护青年的合法利益。工作方法也是照搬行政一套，而不是从青年的特点出发。据安徽蚌埠市城市抽样调查队一次对百名团员的调查，50％的团员认为团组织没有吸引力，其中又有74％的团员认为团组织生活过于枯燥，14％的团员认为团干部能力较弱。
    体现团组织的先进性和群众性
    记者了解到，共青团自身建设存在的两个不足，不利青年教育工作。
    首先是先进性不足。中国共青团是中国先进青年的组织，由于种种原因，减弱了共青团的先进性。一些团的干部和团员在社会生活中发挥先进模范作用等方面表现得不是很充分，甚至很一般，导致不少非团员青年看不到团的先进性，觉得入团不入团都一样。
    其次是群众性不足。中国共青团虽然已拥有团员5600万人，但团员占青年的比例还只有21.4％。团员比例偏低，加上大批团员经商外出，导致青年找不到团组织，受不到团的教育。据有的地方抽样调查，百名青工中，33％表示不愿入团，29％表示无所谓，只有38％的青工表示愿意入团。在农村许多地方，团的建设由于不适应农村社会政治经济的巨大变革，导致一些基层团组织瘫痪。长期在外做工的农村团员，不能参加团的活动，也无法缴纳团费，形成大批团员自行脱团。
    共青团是青年群众的组织，就必然要反映、代表和维护青年的利益。可是遇到改革中的具体问题时，共青团作为党的助手，只能号召、动员青年支持改革，而对由此产生的青年的一些实际问题却无能为力。有的团员对团干部说：“我们有事不找你们，能体谅到其中的难处。”有的青年说：“找你们有什么用，奖金、房子你们没有，街市上电子游戏、康乐球到处都有，要玩，我们自己会去。”这些，客观上也就减弱了团组织对青年的吸引力。
    党、政组织重视是关键
    共青团是党领导下的群众团体。党的各级组织有权力、有责任担负起对团的工作的指导，关心团的建设，关心团干部的成长。但是，据了解，不少党委并没有形成研究青年工作的专门制度，不能经常或定期地了解团的情况，听取团组织的汇报。
    《中国共产党章程》第50条规定，团的县级和县级以下的各级委员会书记，企业事业单位的团委员会书记，可以列席同级党的委员会和常务委员会的会议。这个规定在不少地方没有得到很好落实。据北京市的有关调查，区、县、局级团委负责人只有22％是党委委员，有11％能够经常列席党委会，有22％能够列席党委研究青年工作的会议，有45％没有列席过党委任何会议。记者了解到，主要原因是党的一些基层领导只把这看成是一种待遇，而不是把团的干部真正当成助手和后备军去培养，去使用。不少党的基层领导人不了解党章第50条的规定。共青团北京市委曾搞过一次调查，问起党团关系的时候，有的基层党干部回答不上来。
    各级党政领导人应经常面向基层，到青年中去，了解青年情况，倾听青年呼声，直接关心青年工作。另外，各级党政领导还必须把团的工作放在应有的位置，重视对团的干部的培养使用。各级党校也应承担部分培养团干部的任务。
