On December 10th, the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee held an award ceremony in Oslo, audaciously awarding the Dalai Lama, who engages in separatist activities abroad, with this year's peace prize. At the same time, the Norwegian authorities, in order to support the award ceremony, allowed the Dalai Lama's group to hold "report meetings" and other political activities, and arranged for leaders to meet with them, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs and seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

Tibet has been part of China since ancient times, and the People's Republic of China is a multi-ethnic country including the Tibetan people. This is a fact recognized worldwide. Mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs, are the basic norms of international relations. Socialist China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries and firmly opposes any country or foreign organization from blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs. However, the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee actually referred to China's Tibet as a "country" and called the Dalai Lama, who has been in exile and engaged in separatist activities for a long time, the "political leader" of Tibet, supporting his so-called "struggle to liberate Tibet." This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a trampling of international norms.

It is stipulated in the United Nations Charter that one should not use one's own territory to engage in activities that threaten the security of other countries. However, the Norwegian government not only provided a platform for the Dalai Lama's group to engage in anti-China and "Tibetan independence" activities in Norway but also arranged for government leaders to have "private meetings," giving political support and encouragement. The Norwegian authorities claimed that arranging for leaders to meet was according to "custom," and that the Dalai Lama was a "religious figure" visiting Norway. This is obviously untenable. Everyone knows that the Dalai Lama is first and foremost a political exile who has long been engaged in activities to split the motherland, not a "religious figure." The actions of the Norwegian leaders directly contradict the stance acknowledged by the Norwegian government that "Tibet is part of Chinese territory," worsening bilateral relations and also going against the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter.

According to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize, the award is given to those who have made the greatest efforts and contributions to promoting goodwill and friendship between nations, abolishing or reducing standing armies, and for peace conferences, organizations, and propaganda. Now, the Nobel Peace Prize, under the control of certain people, is actually used to encourage those who incite riots, split the motherland, and stir up ethnic hatred. This not only tarnishes the reputation of the Nobel Peace Prize, which has a lofty purpose, but also harms world peace.

It should be pointed out that the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee's decision this year to award the Dalai Lama the peace prize has a special political agenda. People remember that after the Chinese government suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, some Western countries brandished the sticks of so-called "human rights" and "democracy" to attack China and blatantly interfere in China's internal affairs. For certain political needs, the United States and France recently awarded the Dalai Lama the "Congressional Human Rights Award" and the "Human Rights Award" from the French Freedom Foundation, respectively. In October, when the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee announced the decision to award the Dalai Lama, he openly stated that awarding the Dalai Lama was to "consciously" and "actively" influence political issues, which clearly shows that awarding the Dalai Lama is out of anti-China needs. At the same time, the Western anti-China forces' interest in the Tibet issue, spreading lies, distorting, and defaming the current situation in Tibet, and inciting the Dalai Lama's group to act in Western countries, is also aimed at attempting to separate Tibet from China. Their evil intentions are obvious.

However, those who always want to use "human rights" and "democracy" as a cover to engage in separatist activities and attack China should understand that China is no longer the China of the past that was bullied by others, and Tibet is no longer Tibet under feudal serfdom. All those who uphold justice will see the great changes that have taken place in Tibet. The party's ethnic policies are further implemented, economic construction is booming, people's living standards have significantly improved, and the Tibetan people are striving to build a new Tibet that is united, progressive, civilized, and prosperous. The unity of the motherland and ethnic harmony are the highest interests of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and are the fundamental guarantee for development and prosperity. Any attempt to split socialist China and engage in ethnic separatism will not succeed.

    绝不许借“授奖”干涉中国内政
    冬明
    12月10日，挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会在奥斯陆举行颁奖仪式，悍然把本年度的和平奖授予在国外搞分裂活动的达赖。与此同时，挪威当局为配合颁奖活动，又是纵容达赖一伙搞“报告会”等一系列政治活动，又是安排领导人会见，粗暴干涉中国的内政，严重地伤害了中国各族人民的感情。
    西藏自古就是中国的领土，中华人民共和国是一个包括藏族人民在内的多民族组成的国家。这是举世公认的事实。互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政，是国际关系的基本准则。社会主义的中国从不干涉别国的内政，也坚决反对任何国家、任何外国组织粗暴干涉中国的内政。而挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会竟然把中国西藏称作一个“国家”，把流亡国外、长期搞分裂活动的达赖说成是西藏的“政治领袖”，支持他的所谓“争取解放西藏的斗争”，这是对中国内政的明目张胆的干涉，也是对国际关系准则的践踏。
    不得用本国领土来进行威胁它国安全的活动，是联合国宪章所规定的。而挪威政府当局不仅为达赖一伙在挪威提供反对中国、搞“西藏独立”的活动舞台，而且还安排政府领导人
  “单独会见”，给以政治上的纵容和支持。挪威当局称，安排领导人会见是按照“惯例”，达赖是来挪威的“宗教人士”。这显然是站不住脚的。人们都知道，达赖首先不是什么“宗教人士”，而是长期从事分裂祖国活动的政治流亡者。挪威领导人的作法，直接违背了挪威政府当局所承认的“西藏是中国领土的一部分”这一立场，恶化了两国关系，同时这也是同联合国宪章的有关规定背道而驰的。
    按照诺贝尔和平奖的颁奖宗旨，该奖是奖励那些“为民族间的和睦亲善、废止或裁减常备军以及为和平会议、组织和宣传尽到最大努力和作出最大贡献的人”。如今诺贝尔和平奖却在某些人的把持下，竟然用来去鼓励煽动暴乱、分裂祖国、挑动民族仇恨的人，不仅使其崇高目的的诺贝尔和平奖的名声受辱蒙羞，而且对世界的和平事业也造成了损害。
    应当指出，挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会今年把和平奖颁给达赖，有特别的政治图谋。人们记得，在我国政府平息北京的反革命暴乱之后，西方某些国家就挥舞起所谓“人权”、“民主”的棍棒大肆反华，公然干涉中国的内政。出于某种政治需要，美国和法国不久前曾分别授予达赖以美国的“国会人权奖”和法国自由基金会的“人权奖”。今年10月，当挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会的主席宣布要给达赖授奖时，就曾公开表白，给达赖授奖是为了“有意识地”对政治问题“积极施加影响”，这就明明白白地表明给达赖颁奖是出于反华的需要。同时，西方的反华势力之所以对西藏问题表现出浓厚的兴趣，散布谎言，歪曲和丑化西藏的现状，鼓动达赖一伙在西方国家活动，还在于企图把西藏从中国分离出去，其险恶用心昭然若揭。
    不过，那些总想以“人权”、“民主”为幌子，从事分裂活动和向中国发难的人应当懂得，中国早已不是过去任人欺侮的中国，中国西藏也不是封建农奴主统治下的西藏。所有主持公道的人士都会看到西藏所发生的巨大变化，党的民族政策进一步落实，经济建设蒸蒸日上，人民生活显著提高，藏族人民正在奋发努力，建设团结、进步、文明和富裕的新西藏。祖国的统一，民族的和睦团结，是中国各族人民的最高利益，也是走向发展和繁荣的根本保证。任何想分裂社会主义中国和搞民族分裂的企图都是不可能得逞的。
