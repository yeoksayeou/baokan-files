According to a report from the *Beijing Daily*, "Tightening our belts will not affect the fulfillment of contracts; nor will it lead to a general decline in the living standards of urban and rural residents, let alone to the point where we have to eat steamed buns and pickled vegetables." This was stated by Li Ximing, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, at the Eighth Plenary Session (Expanded) of the Sixth Beijing Municipal Party Committee on December 18.

He said, "When we talk about tightening our belts for a few years, it means first, we must continue to adhere to the policy of tight fiscal and credit control, strictly control the scale of fixed asset investments, and especially press down on non-productive buildings like halls and pavilions. Second, we must continue to control the purchasing power of society, control the expenditures of government agencies, organizations, and enterprises, and resolutely overcome the bad habits of extravagance and luxury. Third, we must continue to curb high consumption and overconsumption, and truly base the improvement of people's living standards on increased labor productivity and production development.

Currently, some people are not mentally prepared for tightening our belts. Some are concerned that tightening our belts will affect the fulfillment of contracts, while others are worried that 'tightening our belts will mean eating steamed buns and pickled vegetables again.' Comrade Li Ximing said, therefore, we must clearly tell the broad masses that tightening our belts does not mean a general decline in the living standards of urban and rural residents, let alone to the point where we have to eat steamed buns and pickled vegetables. However, we must also explain to the people that tightening our belts also means that the growth rates of workers' income and consumption will not be as high as in previous years. Over the past few years, our living standards have increased faster than production, which is abnormal, and it is appropriate to tighten our belts. In the future, the growth of wages and bonuses must be based on production development and increased efficiency. For enterprises that have completed their contract targets, the contracts must be fulfilled, and wages and bonuses will be paid as agreed. However, it is also possible that some enterprises, due to poor management, will see a decrease in workers' wages and bonuses, and a reduction in income. We hope that the broad masses of workers can understand the country's difficulties, consider the bigger picture, and share the country's burdens and hardships."

Comrade Li Ximing emphasized that in the spirit of hard work and tightening our belts, all levels of leadership must set an example and take the lead. Starting from the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, and from the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government agencies. Whatever is required of subordinate agencies and grassroots levels, the leading agencies must first achieve. Currently, there are also serious waste phenomena in government agencies, organizations, and public institutions, and there is great potential for savings. We must continue to reduce administrative expenditure spending, and money that can be spent or not spent must not be spent. All levels of party and government leaders must be clean and self-disciplined. Those who damage public property for personal gain, use their power for personal benefit, and waste national resources must be seriously investigated and dealt with. We must vigorously promote the spirit of dedication among the broad masses of party members and the people, and create a social atmosphere where thrift is glorious and waste is shameful. We must cherish every penny, every grain of rice, every drop of electricity, and every drop of water, and protect the property of the state and the collective, creating and accumulating wealth for socialism.

### 李锡铭在北京市委会上指出  过紧日子决不影响承包兑现  居民生活水平普遍不会下降

    李锡铭在北京市委会上指出
    过紧日子决不影响承包兑现
    居民生活水平普遍不会下降
    本报讯　据《北京日报》报道：“过紧日子决不会影响承包兑现；也决不是要使城乡居民生活水平普遍下降，更不会紧到吃窝头、啃咸菜的地步。”这是北京市委书记李锡铭12月18日在北京市委六届八次全体（扩大）会议上指出的。
    他说，我们所说的过几年紧日子，一是要继续坚持财政、信贷双紧的方针，严格控制固定资产投资规模，尤其对那些非生产性的楼堂馆所，一定要压下来。二是继续控制社会集团购买力，控制机关团体、企事业单位的开支，坚决克服铺张浪费、奢侈豪华的不良风气。三是继续抑制高消费和超前消费，把人民群众生活水平的提高真正建立在劳动生产率提高、生产发展的基础上。
    现在，一些群众对过几年紧日子的思想准备不足，有的担心过紧日子会影响承包兑现，有的担心“过紧日子又要吃窝头、啃咸菜”。李锡铭同志说，所以明确地告诉广大群众，过紧日子决不是要使城乡居民生活水平普遍下降，更不会紧到吃窝头、啃咸菜的地步。但是，也要向群众讲清楚，过紧日子，也意味着职工收入和消费的增长幅度不会再像过去几年那么大。这几年我们生活的提高超过了生产的增长，这是不正常的，适当加以紧缩也是应该的。今后，工资、奖金的增长，一定要建立在生产发展、效益提高的基础上。对于完成了承包指标的企业，合同一定要兑现，工资、奖金照发。但也不排除一些企业由于经营状况不好，职工工资奖金会有所下降，收入减少。希望广大职工能理解国家的困难，从大局出发，为国分忧解难。
    李锡铭同志强调，艰苦奋斗，过紧日子，各级领导干部要以身作则，起表率作用。要从市委、市政府领导做起，从市委、市政府机关做起。凡是要求下级机关和基层做到的，领导机关首先要做到。现在，机关、团体和事业单位，浪费现象也相当严重，节约潜力很大。要继续压缩行政费用支出，可花可不花的钱，坚决不花。各级党政领导干部，都要廉洁奉公，严于自律。对那些损公肥私、以权谋私、奢侈浪费、挥霍国家资财的行为，一定要严肃查处。要在广大党员和群众中大力提倡奉献精神，在全社会形成节约光荣、浪费可耻的风气，珍惜一分钱、一两粮、一度电、一滴水，爱护国家和集体的财产，为社会主义创造和积累财富。
