Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 19th.

In the depths of winter in the mountainous regions of Fujian Province, people can be seen everywhere preparing land and planting saplings. By the end of November, the province had prepared 53.5 million mu of land for afforestation, cultivated 17.4 billion saplings, and produced 2.1 billion container-grown seedlings.

Fujian is one of China's major collective forestry regions. In May, the provincial Party Committee and government held a forestry work conference and formulated a seven-year plan to afforest 200 million mu of barren mountains and increase the forest coverage rate from the current 43% to 55%. To ensure the high-standard completion of afforestation and greening tasks, Fujian has established a responsibility system for afforestation and greening at all levels of leadership this year.

    闽山区整地造林
    据新华社福州12月19日电  （记者刘国柱、巫奕龙）深冬的福建省山区，处处可见整地挖穴造林的人们。截至11月底，全省已整理林地535万亩，培育树苗17.4亿株，容器育苗2.1亿袋。
    福建是我国南方主要集体林区。省委、省政府今年5月召开了林业工作会议，制定了荒山造林2000万亩、将森林覆盖率从目前的43％提高到55％的7年规划。为了高标准完成造林绿化任务，福建今年建立了各级领导班子造林绿化责任制。
