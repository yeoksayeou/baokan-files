The fifth Finland Ping-Pong Open team competition concluded this afternoon here, with the Chinese men's and women's teams both winning the championships.

In the men's team competition, South Korea secured the second place, while Japan and Sweden tied for third. The Hong Kong team won the women's team runner-up position, with South Korea and Japan tying for third.

The men's team final, held this afternoon, was particularly thrilling. Chen Zhibin of the Chinese team first faced Liu Nan-gui of the South Korean team, winning with scores of 21:16 and 21:11. Next, Chinese star Ma Wen-ge faced Kim Jae-su. Ma Wen-ge combined European mid-table tactics with Chinese fast-attack techniques, displaying great flexibility and variety, and won with scores of 18:21, 21:17, and 21:17.

In the doubles match against Liu Nan-gui and Park Ji-hyeon, Ma Wen-ge and Chen Zhibin collaborated seamlessly, winning with scores of 21:16 and 21:19, securing the final victory for the Chinese team.

In the women's team final, Qiao Hong first faced Chan Dan-lai of the Hong Kong team, losing the first set 22:24, 21:12, and 11:21. Next, Chen Jing faced Tsai Pao-hua but lost 16:21 and 11:21. In the third set, Chen Jing and Hu Xiao-xin turned the situation around, winning with two 21:13 scores. Qiao Hong and Chen Jing fought hard in the final two sets, ultimately defeating the Hong Kong team.

The Chinese team leader commented after the match that the Chinese athletes fought with high spirits and generally performed at their best. However, their performance against the Hong Kong team was not ideal. He also noted that the South Korean team sent many players to Europe for training, aiming to prepare for the Asian Games, which is worth noting. From this competition, it is evident that their players have considerable strength, but their individual techniques and receiving skills are still not ideal.

The men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles finals of this open competition will be held on December 3rd.

    芬兰乒乓赛我获男女团体冠军
    新华社赫尔辛基12月2日电　第五届芬兰乒乓球公开赛团体赛今天下午在这里结束，中国男女队双双荣获冠军。
    在男子团体赛中南朝鲜获得第二名，日本和瑞典并列第三名。香港队获女团亚军，南朝鲜与日本并列第三名。
    在今天下午举行的男团决赛最为精彩。中国队的陈志斌首先迎战南朝鲜队的刘南奎，以21∶16和21∶11的比分首先为中国队赢得一分。接着由中国名将马文革同金泽洙对抗。马文革把欧洲的中台技术与中国的近台快攻结合起来，灵活多变，以18∶21、21∶17和21∶17为中国队再赢一分。
    在与刘南奎和朴知贤的双打赛中，马文革与陈志斌配合默契，又以21∶16和21∶19的比分轻取对手，使中国队获得了最后胜利。
    在女子团体赛决赛中首先由乔红与香港队的陈丹蕾对阵，结果以22∶24，21∶12和11∶21先失一分。接着，由陈静迎战齐宝华，但仍以16∶21，11∶21败阵。第三盘由陈静和胡小新出战，终以两个21∶13扭转战局。乔红和陈静在最后两盘中经过长时间的鏖战终于险胜香港队。
    中国队领队在赛后说，我国运动员斗志昂扬，基本上发挥了自己的水平，但在与香港队一战中发挥不够理想。他还指出，南朝鲜队这次派出众多队员到欧洲练兵，目的为亚运会作准备，值得重视。从这次比赛看，他们的队员已具有相当的实力，但个人技术和接发球尚不够理想。
    本次公开赛的男女单打、男女双打和混合双打决赛将于3日进行。
