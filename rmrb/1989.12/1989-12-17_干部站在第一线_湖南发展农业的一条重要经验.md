This year, Hunan Province's grain production finally broke through the stagnation of the past five years, with a total output exceeding 26.5 billion kilograms, setting a new historical record. Cotton, oil, sugar, fruit, and tobacco crops also saw increases in production.

One of their key experiences is that at all levels, cadres have, in the process of promoting agricultural production, carried forward the Party's tradition of deepening practical work, setting up demonstration points, and sharing joys and sorrows with the people. They have stood on the frontline, taking their work to the villages and households.

Promoting a spirit of investigation and research, stabilizing rural economic policies.

At the beginning of the year, Provincial Party Secretary Xióng Qīngcuī visited the Dongting Lake area to understand the mood of the people after the previous year's floods and their self-reliant production and recovery efforts. Someone proposed implementing a "two-field system" (subsistence field and responsibility field) on a large scale to expand the scale of land operations and change the household-based contract responsibility system. Xióng Qīngcuī immediately pointed out that the household-based contract responsibility system is in line with the current level of agricultural productivity in the entire province and should be maintained and continuously improved, and should not be easily changed. The "two-field system" and appropriate scale operations can only be piloted in a few places where conditions are met and the people are willing. Later, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government repeatedly emphasized this idea at various occasions, avoiding unnecessary fluctuations. In the early summer, various rumors spread in rural Hunan, and some farmers feared "policy changes," with some cutting down trees and others not daring to engage in individual operations. After Provincial Governor Chén Bāngzhù and others conducted a survey in Wangcheng County in mid-June and discovered these problems, they quickly disseminated through newspapers, radio, and television that the Party's rural policies would not change, the contract responsibility system would not change, and encouraged farmers to develop production with confidence and hard work, enriching themselves, and once again stabilizing public sentiment. In the autumn, Vice Governor Zhuó Kāngníng went to the grassroots to inspect agricultural development. A county reported that its approach to developing agriculture was "forest, fruit, tea, planting, breeding, and processing." Zhuó Kāngníng immediately pointed out that grain is the foundation of the foundation, and it should never be neglected. It is better to promote grain and forestry together, and to combine planting, breeding, and processing, helping them correct the direction of agricultural development and avoiding new disruptions.

Establishing demonstration models, guiding farmers to promote advanced scientific and technological practices.

Hunan is the birthplace of hybrid rice. In scientific research, breeding, seed production, and cultivation technology, it has always been at the forefront. From 1976 to 1988, the province planted 240 million mu of hybrid rice, increasing rice production by 20.821 billion kilograms. Such achievements are inseparable from the efforts of leading cadres who went to the countryside to establish demonstration models. This year, the work has been done even better. According to statistics from the agricultural department, this year, various levels of cadres went to the countryside to set up 31,000 demonstration points, planting 12.28 million mu of demonstration fields, of which 8.94 million mu are grain crops, and it is estimated that 5 million mu can become "ton-per-mu fields." With the support and assistance of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Mayor Sū Jiānmín, Deputy Mayor Zhōu Péi, and County Magistrate Chén Línquán of Hengyang City led more than ten cadres to establish a 15,000-mu double-crop hybrid rice demonstration plot in four townships and 11 villages in Hengyang County. They focused on promoting excellent varieties that are cost-effective, have significant increases in yield, and are adaptable, using advanced cultivation and fertilization technologies. The total production increased by 18% compared to last year, with an average yield of 979.7 kilograms per mu. A cadre from the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, Lóng Xíngcái, was sent to Yangliu District in Wugang County to serve as deputy district chief. Together with local cadres, he reformed the cultivation system, established a hybrid corn demonstration plot, and tapped into the potential for increased production in dry land in hilly areas. He mobilized the masses door-to-door, signing technical contracts with farmers at their homes. The 1,620 mu of spring hybrid corn in the demonstration plot had an average yield of 478 kilograms per mu, more than doubling last year's production.

Cadres going deep into the grassroots also took the lead in participating in labor, leading to a rare surge in water conservancy construction and the accumulation of farmyard manure in the province. Just last winter and this spring, the province's agricultural water conservancy labor investment reached 369 million man-days, expanding and improving the irrigation area by 3.17 million mu. The labor investment and completed engineering volume were the highest in recent years.

During the spring farmyard manure accumulation activities this year, many cadres, including some major leaders at the municipal, county, and district levels, rolled up their trousers and went to the fields to carry farmyard manure. According to statistics from relevant departments, the amount of farmyard manure used in the province this year increased by about 10 dan per mu compared to last year.

    干部站在第一线
    ——湖南发展农业的一条重要经验
    新华社记者　杨善清　刘金桐　赵洪峰
    今年，湖南省粮食生产终于突破了连续5年的徘徊局面，总产超过265亿公斤，创历史最高纪录，棉、油、糖、果、烟等作物也项项增产。
    他们的一条重要经验是，各级干部在抓农业生产中，发扬我党深入实际，蹲点示范，与群众同甘共苦的优良作风，站在第一线，把工作做到乡村、农户。
    大兴调查研究之风，稳定农村各项经济政策。
    年初，省委书记熊清泉到洞庭湖区了解去年水灾之后群众的情绪和开发生产自救的情况时，有人提出要在大面上搞“两田（口粮田和责任田）制”，扩大耕地经营规模，改变以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制。熊清泉当即指出，以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制，符合目前全省农村生产力发展水平，应当保持稳定和不断完善，不能轻易变动，“两田制”和适度规模经营，目前只能在条件具备、群众又自愿的个别地方进行试点。以后，省委、省政府又在各种场合反复强调这个思想，避免了不必要的波动。初夏，湖南农村一度出现各种谣传，部分农民怕“政策变”，有的乱砍树木，有的不敢再搞个体经营。省长陈邦柱等6月中旬到望城县农村调查发现上述问题后，迅速通过报纸和广播电视反复宣传，党的农村政策不会变，联产承包责任制不会变，鼓励农民放心大胆发展生产，勤劳致富，再次安定了民心。秋天，副省长卓康宁到基层考察农业开发情况。有个县汇报该县发展农业的路子是“林果茶，种养加”。卓康宁当即指出，粮食是基础的基础，任何时候也不能忽视，还是提粮林并举、种养加结合为好，帮助他们端正了农业发展的路子，避免了新的折腾。
    办示范样板，引导农民推广先进科学技术。
    湖南是杂交水稻之乡，在科研、育种、繁殖制种和栽培技术方面一直处于领先地位。1976年到1988年，全省共种植杂交稻2.4亿多亩，增产稻谷208.21亿公斤。能取得这样的成绩，是与领导干部下乡办示范样板分不开的。今年，这项工作搞得更好了。据农业部门统计，今年全省各级干部下乡办示范点3.1万个，种样板田1228万亩，其中粮食作物894万亩，预计其中500万亩可成为“吨粮田”。在省农业厅的支持、帮助下，衡阳市市长苏健民、副市长周培和衡东县县长陈林泉带领10多名干部，在衡东县的4乡11村办了1.5万亩的双季杂交稻吨粮示范片，重点推广花钱较少、增产显著、适应性强的优良品种，采用先进的栽培、施肥等技术，总产比去年增加18％，平均亩产达到979.7公斤。省统计局干部龙行才被派到武冈县杨柳区任副区长后，与当地干部一起，改革耕作制度，办起杂交玉米示范片，挖掘山丘区旱土的增产潜力。他挨家挨户发动群众，上门与农户签订技术承包合同，示范片的1620亩春季杂交玉米，平均亩产达478公斤，比去年增产1倍多。
    干部深入基层，还带头参加劳动，促使全省出现了多年未有的兴修水利和积制农家肥的热潮。仅去冬今春，全省农民水利投工就达3.69亿个，扩大和改善灌溉面积317万亩。投工和完成工程量都是近几年来最多的。
    在今年春季积制农家肥的活动中，很多干部，包括一些地市县的主要领导，都曾卷起裤筒下田，担农家肥下地。据有关部门统计，今年全省使用的农家肥，每亩比去年增加10担左右。
