The People's Republic of China has established 74 high-quality cotton base counties. This year, these base counties planted 25.32 million mu of cotton, accounting for about one-third of the national cotton area, and are expected to produce a total of 30.21 million dan of cotton, approximately 40% of the national total cotton production. Compared to 1985, before the establishment of the base, this represents an increase of 8.5% and 7.9% respectively. Experts unanimously agree that the high-quality cotton base has begun to play an important role in stabilizing, restoring, and developing cotton production in China. In the future, it will undoubtedly strongly promote the gradual stabilization, high quality, high yield, and high efficiency of cotton production in China. This information was obtained by the reporter from the national high-quality cotton base construction summary meeting that just concluded in Jinan, Shandong.

The construction of high-quality cotton bases is the largest systematic project in cotton production since the founding of New China. Approved by the State Council, starting from 1985, the state has invested nearly 230 million yuan, plus local matching funds totaling about 400 million yuan, to build 74 high-quality cotton base counties in two batches in 14 major cotton-producing provinces and regions. Additionally, 99 agricultural technology promotion centers have been established in concentrated cotton-producing counties, and 31 research institutions and 15 agricultural colleges have been supported to serve the base counties. The investment in base construction is mainly used for three projects directly related to increasing cotton yield and quality: cotton original seed farms, high-quality cotton processing plants, and agricultural technology promotion centers.

    系统开发与科技进步显威力
    七十四个优质棉基地县
    今年棉产量占全国四成
    新华社济南12月12日电  （记者王进业）我国已建成74个优质棉基地县。今年，这些基地县植棉2532万亩，占全国棉花面积的1／3左右，预计总产3021万担，约占全国棉花总产量的40％，分别比建基地前的1985年增长8.5％和7.9％。专家们一致认为，优质棉基地对稳定、恢复和发展我国棉花生产的重要作用已开始显示出来，今后必将有力推动我国棉花生产逐步走向稳定、优质、高产、高效。这是记者从刚在山东济南结束的全国优质棉基地建设总结会议上了解到的信息。
    优质棉基地建设，是新中国成立以来棉花生产上一项最大的系统工程。经国务院批准，从1985年开始，国家投资近2.3亿元，加上地方配套资金共约4亿元，分两批在全国14个主要产棉省区选建74个优质棉基地县，并在集中产棉县建设99个农业技术推广中心，还扶持31个科研单位和15所农业院校为基地县服务。基地建设投资主要用于与提高棉花产量和质量有直接关系的棉花原种场、良种棉加工厂、农业技术推广中心等3个项目上。
