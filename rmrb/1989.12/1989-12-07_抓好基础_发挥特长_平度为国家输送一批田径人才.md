The "National Advanced Sports County" of Shandong Pingdu focuses on developing sports from primary and secondary schools and pays special attention to cultivating track and field talents. In the past five years, Pingdu has sent 12 track and field athletes to provincial and above excellent sports teams and 48 sports talents to higher sports colleges. In provincial and above competitions, Pingdu athletes have won a total of 29 gold medals; 7 athletes have broken 9 provincial records, 3 have broken 5 national records, and 1 has broken 2 world records three times.

The Pingdu Municipal (County-level City) Sports Commission believes that track and field is a key project in various sports, and to comprehensively revitalize Pingdu's sports, it is necessary to strive to improve the technical level of track and field events. Therefore, they decided to start from basic training to comprehensively improve the quality. All 700-plus primary and secondary schools in the city take track and field as the main content of physical education teaching. Out of 480 full-time physical education teachers in the city, most have received middle-level or above sports teacher training. Each school holds track and field meets in the spring and autumn, and the city holds track and field meets and single-item competitions for primary and secondary school students every year, forming a competition system that promotes both popularization and improvement.

To improve the track and field training level of primary and secondary school students, the city has formed a training network consisting of traditional track and field projects in primary and secondary schools at the grassroots level and key amateur youth sports schools. The city also implements linked training in primary, secondary, and high schools within the scope of each township, improving the training level.

The municipal party committee and government actively create a good environment for the development of track and field events. The municipal government has allocated 2.5 million yuan to build a stadium that can accommodate 15,000 spectators with stands. There are 115 track and field venues with 200-meter tracks or longer in the city, including 9 with 400-meter tracks.

Pingdu attaches great importance to track and field, and track and field talents are emerging. Li Sujie, a sports star from Pingdu, has broken the women's race walking world record three times in the National Race Walking Championships, the Beijing International Athletics Championships, and the Shandong Provincial Games.
