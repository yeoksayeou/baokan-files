According to a recent report by the British "Observer," the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide increased during the 1980s.

The report states that over the course of this decade, more than 200 million people joined the ranks of the "absolutely poor." These individuals cannot earn enough money to afford basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. The per capita income in Latin American countries decreased by 9%, while in African countries, it dropped by 25%. In the next decade, the global poverty rate is expected to continue rising. The report attributes the increase in poverty rates to disastrous trends such as unreasonable raw material prices, increasing debt, and reduced aid.

    八十年代世界贫困率上升
    新华社伦敦电　据英国《观察家报》最近报道，八十年代全世界生活在极端贫困状态下的人数有所增加。
    报道说，在这10年当中，有2亿多人加入了“绝对贫穷者”的队伍。这些人不能挣到足够的钱来支付维持基本生活所需的食物、衣服和住所。拉美国家的人均收入下降了9％，非洲国家人均收入下降了25％。在未来的10年中，世界贫困率还将进一步上升。报道把贫困率增长的原因归咎于不合理的原料价格、日益增加的债务和援助减少等灾难性趋势。
