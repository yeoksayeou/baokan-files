    Facing a sluggish market and tight funds, Kaifeng City in Henan Province has actively created a favorable "microclimate" for enterprises, helping them solve specific production problems and further improving the contract responsibility system. Currently, the downward trend in industrial production has been halted, and the industrial output value for November increased by 9.5% compared to the same period last year.

    Kaifeng City's industrial structure is characterized by a high proportion of processing industries and a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises. The sluggish market and tight funds have had a more pronounced impact on these enterprises. Since the third quarter of this year, the growth rate of industrial production has dropped from over 10% to below 4%. Kaifeng City has promptly adopted measures to improve the "microclimate" to adapt to the "macroclimate," helping enterprises overcome difficulties. In response to the recent difficulties faced by enterprises due to market sluggishness and concerns about clean governance, they have helped enterprises analyze market conditions and emphasized that "thoughts must not slip." They have also clarified the boundaries between illegal income and legitimate contract earnings, ensuring the fulfillment of contract bonuses. For normal business interactions, they have provided affirmation and implemented a "business activity fee contract," allowing sales personnel to conduct business with confidence. For enterprises whose contracts are expiring, they have continued the contracts, stabilizing morale.

    In the fourth quarter, the municipal government organized the Economic Commission, Planning Commission, Materials, Finance, Commerce, and Taxation departments to form an industrial production service team, assisting 21 key enterprises across the city. The municipal electrical machinery factory faced long-overdue payments for sold products, and the Commerce Bureau service team helped resolve this issue. The municipal machinery factory lacked raw materials, and the Materials Bureau service team, upon entering the factory, immediately helped secure 5,000 tons of raw materials.

    Kaifeng City has also actively promoted cooperation between industrial and commercial enterprises, helping enterprises sell their products. With the urban market sluggish and the rural market vast, the municipal government provided preferential policies to the supply and marketing cooperatives. Enterprises, through price concessions, leveraged the cooperatives' advantages in developing the rural market. In the past two months, the sales volume of printed and dyed fabrics, wool yarn, and enamelware has significantly increased.

    Solving problems encountered by enterprises in contracting. Some enterprises, due to significant changes in the external environment, were reluctant to accept a second round of contracting after the first period ended. The municipal government and the Economic Commission took the initiative to do ideological work with the contractors and formulated new contracting methods, namely "determining the base number and sharing the surplus," enabling enterprises to adapt to changes in the external environment. Recently, some enterprises have accepted the second round of contracting, playing a role in stabilizing the contracting of enterprises across the city.

    为企业创造良性“小气候”  开封工业生产重现生机
    生产下滑得到制止产值开始增长
    本报讯　记者王彦田报道：面对市场疲软、资金紧张的严峻形势，河南省开封市积极为企业创造良性“小气候”，帮助企业解决生产中的具体难题，进一步完善承包经营责任制。目前全市工业生产下滑的势头已得到制止，11月份工业产值比去年同期增长9.5％。
    开封市工业结构中，加工工业比重较大，中小企业多，市场疲软、资金紧张对企业的冲击更为突出。从今年第三季度起，工业生产增长速度从10％以上降到4％以下。开封市及时采取改善“小气候”适应“大气候”的办法，帮助企业渡难关。针对企业近来一段时期对市场疲软的畏难情绪和廉政建设在企业引起的顾虑，他们帮助企业分析行情，提出“思想不能滑坡”的要求。并明确非法收入和正当承包所得的界限，坚持兑现承包奖励。对企业在经营活动中的正常交往给予肯定，实行“经营活动费承包”，使购销人员放心开展业务。对承包到期的企业，继续承包，稳定了人心。
    进入第四季度后，市政府组织经委、计委、物资、财政、工商、税务等有关部门组成工业生产服务队，到全市21家重点企业帮助工作。市电机厂产品销售后货款长期被拖欠，市工商局服务队帮助他们解决了这一难题；市机械厂缺原材料，市物资局服务队进厂后，立即帮助解决了5000吨原材料。
    开封市还积极促进工商两家联合，帮助企业销售产品。城市市场疲软，农村市场广阔，市政府给供销社优惠政策，企业通过让利，发挥供销社在开拓农村市场中的优势。近两个月，印染布、毛线、搪瓷等产品的销量大幅度增加。
    解决企业在承包中遇到的难题。一些企业因外部环境变化大，第一期承包结束后不乐意再接受第二期承包，市政府和经委等部门主动做承包者的思想工作，并定出了新的承包办法，即“确定基数，超额分成”，使企业有适应外部环境变化的能力。最近，有的企业已接受了第二期承包，起到了稳定全市企业承包的作用。
