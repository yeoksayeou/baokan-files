    Ensure Thorough Management of Winter Crops
    Chen Yaobang Urges Local Governments to Focus on Four Key Areas
    People's Daily, Beijing, December 22 — Xinhua News Agency reporters Pu Libing and People's Daily reporter He Jiazheng report: This year, China's autumn-winter sowing has a solid foundation, but factors that could hinder the summer grain harvest should not be overlooked. Chen Yaobang, deputy minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, has urged local governments to take immediate action and thoroughly manage winter crops in the fields to ensure a bumper harvest of summer grains and oils next year.

    Today, after inspecting the wheat fields in Shunyi County, Beijing, Chen Yaobang briefed the accompanying capital news reporters on the national autumn-winter sowing situation.

    Chen Yaobang called on local governments to thoroughly carry out the following tasks:

    First, further strengthen leadership, maintain confidence, and be prepared for disaster relief and bumper harvests. Southern regions should address policy issues to alleviate farmers' concerns about growing and growing well winter wheat; Northern regions should summarize the experiences of this year's bumper harvest and prepare for drought resistance. Second, adopt measures tailored to local conditions, provide classified guidance, and improve the level of scientific and technological input. Third, actively prepare production materials, and ensure the availability of necessary agricultural production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, and machinery for winter and spring field management. Fourth, coordinate agricultural water conservancy construction and winter crop field management, ensuring that both winter repairs and winter management are carried out simultaneously, while also paying attention to winter fertilizer accumulation, and avoiding neglecting one aspect for another.

    扎扎实实抓好越冬作物管理
    陈耀邦吁请各地做好四项工作
    本报北京12月22日讯　新华社记者蒲立业、本报记者何加正报道：今年我国秋冬种基础较好，但制约夏粮丰收的因素仍不可忽视。农业部副部长陈耀邦为此吁请各地，绝不可有丝毫麻痹松劲情绪，要紧急行动起来，扎扎实实抓好越冬作物田间管理，争取明年夏季粮油丰收。
    今天，陈耀邦副部长在实地踏看了京郊顺义县麦田管理情况后，向随行的首都新闻记者介绍了全国秋冬种情况。
    陈耀邦要求各地扎扎实实做好以下工作：
    第一，进一步加强领导，坚定信心，立足于抗灾夺丰收。南方要解决好政策问题，解除农民多种和种好小麦的后顾之忧；北方要总结今年夺丰收的经验，并做好抗大旱的准备。第二，因地制宜，分类指导，提高科技投入水平。第三，积极筹措生产资料，做好今冬明春越冬田间管理所需的化肥、农药、柴油、机械等急需的农业生产资料准备。第四，农田水利基本建设和越冬作物田间管理要统筹安排，做到一手抓冬修，一手抓冬管，同时要注意搞好冬季积肥，切不可顾此失彼。
