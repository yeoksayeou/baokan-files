	History as a Mirror to Judge Right and Wrong
	— Experts and Scholars Discuss Tibet
	By Huamin Shi

	Recently, the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee awarded the Dalai Lama, and the French Memorial Award Committee presented a "Human Rights Award" to the Dalai Lama, claiming to honor his contributions to peace and the protection of Tibetan culture. In response, some Chinese experts and scholars on ethnic issues, as well as prominent figures in the religious community, spoke to a reporter and pointed out that history cannot be distorted. A wealth of facts show that since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, especially since the democratic reforms, Tibet has undergone tremendous changes in its social, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The bringers of peace, progress, and prosperity to Tibet are the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, not any other individuals or organizations. The Tibetan people have a bright future only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and within the socialist family of the motherland.

	Who is the Guardian of Tibet's Peace?
	Yaya Zhang, the president of the Chinese Ethnic Theory Society and a renowned expert on ethnic issues, said: In 1959, the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, successfully completed the democratic reforms, abolished the serfdom system, and gained a peaceful and stable environment for production and life. Before the democratic reforms, Tibet was under a serfdom system, the darkest social system. Under this system, the Tibetan people did not even have the most basic personal freedom, let alone human rights. In 1959, at the request of the Tibetan people, the Communist Party abolished the serfdom system throughout Tibet and carried out socialist transformation, which was a correct and historical choice in line with the will of the people and was supported by the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups. For decades, millions of liberated serfs who had suffered under the dark and cruel serfdom system have enjoyed equal rights in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects with other ethnic groups, basking in the sunshine of socialism, and have achieved remarkable construction achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. This is a historical fact that even the Dalai Lama cannot deny.

	Duojie Cairen, the director of the China Tibetology Research Center, who has worked and lived in Tibet for half a century, said: I am a researcher of Tibetan history, and I deeply feel that the democratic reforms under the leadership of the Communist Party of China are a profound and epoch-making change in Tibet's thousand-year history, and it is the socialist system that has brought true prosperity and peace to Tibet. In 1959, I represented the central government and the government in Lhasa to distribute alms, and about eight or nine thousand beggars came. At that time, Lhasa was surrounded by vast slums around the magnificent temples. About 5% of the Tibetan population, the three great landlords, namely the official family, the nobility, and the upper echelon of the temple monks, owned all the land, pastures, and most of the livestock in Tibet, while more than 90% of the Tibetan population, the serf class, depended on the three great landlords, had no land of their own, and had no personal freedom. The development of productive forces was greatly constrained. However, after 30 years of democratic reforms, the broad masses of serfs became masters of their own fate, and Tibet's social economy and culture have achieved tremendous achievements. In 1988, compared with 1959, grain production increased by nearly three times, the total number of livestock increased by 1.4 times, and the total agricultural and pastoral output value increased by 3.9 times; modern industry has gone from nonexistence to existence, and currently, there are 263 industrial enterprises of various types in the region, with a total industrial output value of 200 million yuan in 1988. The population of Tibet was 1.27 million in 1953 and increased to 2.07 million in 1987. The average life expectancy of Tibetans was 35.5 years before liberation, and it is now 63.7 years. All of this is achieved by the Tibetan people under the leadership of the Party. Before the democratic reforms, some imperialist separatists abroad told the Tibetan nobles not to reform their serfdom system, saying that once they abolished it, there would be no serfdom system in the world. They wanted to turn Tibet into a dark and decadent feudal serfdom museum. They are now plotting Tibet's independence to separate Tibet from the socialist family and make the Tibetan people return to their past suffering.

	Qia Bai Cidengpingcuo, a researcher at the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences, said when talking about the destructive nature of separatist elements on Tibet's social stability: In recent years, the several riots that have occurred in Lhasa were instigated by a small number of separatist elements inside and outside the region, but their destruction and influence have spread throughout Tibet, disrupting the peaceful and happy living environment of the Tibetan people and interfering with Tibet's economic development. The State Council's decision to impose martial law in the Lhasa region is timely and necessary. It is to protect the vital interests of the Tibetan people and to ensure a normal environment for production, life, and study.

	Who is the Representative of the Interests of the Tibetan People?
	Duojie Cairen said: Under the past feudal serfdom system, the vast majority of Tibetan serfs had no personal rights to speak of. At that time, when serfs met, they did not ask each other's names but asked whose serf they were. The landlords regarded serfs as private property and treated them as talking livestock that could be bought, sold, mortgaged, or given as gifts to each other. Even marriage and childbirth were subject to the interference of the landlords. If they were not satisfied, they would immediately suffer severe beatings from the landlords. The three great landlords had the power of life and death over the serfs. Take education as an example. Serfs did not even dare to think about it. Tibet also had schools at that time, but they were all private schools, and only a few hundred children of officials and nobles could go to school. Monks were not all able to study and receive education. Tibet had thousands of monks at that time, but only 15% of them could sit and read scriptures, while the other 85% of monks had only the share of labor, and they were actually slaves wearing robes. Now, Tibet has 2,469 schools of various types, with more than 165,000 students.

	Shi Yan, a professor who has long been engaged in the study of ethnic law, said: The Party and the government have formulated a series of laws and regulations to ensure that the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups truly exercise their right to be masters of their own fate. China has initially formed a system of ethnic laws with the Constitution as the basis, the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy as the mainstay, and including other relevant laws, regulations, and autonomous regulations and single regulations of ethnic autonomous regions. These laws effectively guarantee the equal rights and autonomy rights of ethnic groups in various regions, including Tibet, and the right to participate in the power of the country at all levels. Ethnic minorities account for 6.7% of China's total population, while ethnic minorities' deputies to the National People's Congress account for 14% of the total number of deputies to the National People's Congress. Last year's Fifth Session of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress had 82.9% of the deputies being Tibetans and other ethnic minorities. Since the establishment of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the Autonomous Region, 23 local regulations have been formulated and promulgated. The Constitution and the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy also stipulate that the chairman of the government of the ethnic autonomous region must be a cadre of the ethnic group implementing autonomy. In the leadership of the Tibet Autonomous Region at the district level, Tibetan cadres account for 83.9%, and the heads of the people's congresses, governments, and party and government leaders at all levels and in all cities and counties are all Tibetans. All of this is a true embodiment of ethnic equality, which fully guarantees the political rights of ethnic minorities and is recognized by multi-ethnic countries around the world.

	Who is the Protector of Tibetan Culture?
	Ren Jiyu, the director of the Beijing Library and a renowned expert in religious studies, said: Buddhist culture is an important part of the entire Chinese national culture. Tibetan Buddhism, or Lamaism, occupies an even more important position in Tibetan culture. The Party and the government have always attached great importance to the protection of religious culture. For example, since 1982, the state has allocated tens of thousands to tens of millions of yuan in special funds each year to collate and publish the "Chinese Buddhist Canon" (Chinese part). Now, this classic has been published in more than thirty volumes, and this classic will have a total of 220 volumes, each with 1000 pages, and the number of words will be in the billions. It will be the most complete Buddhist canon in the world. Since last year, the "Chinese Buddhist Canon" (Tibetan part) has also begun to be collated and published, which will also be a massive project. The completion of these two projects will not only be of immeasurable benefit to the study of Tibetan studies and religious culture in our country but will also be a great contribution to world culture. In the field of religious studies, our progress in recent years has also been significant. In 1982, we established a religious studies major in universities and have trained several classes of doctoral students. Their theses have attracted the attention of the international religious studies community. Now, Japan's study of Buddhism and Taoism also sends people to learn here. Of course, we do not deny that during the ten years of turmoil, the economy and culture of the Tibetan region suffered significant losses. But this was not a persecution of ethnic minorities by the Han people but a disaster that included the entire Chinese nation, including the Han people.

	Nacang Xiangba Angwong, the vice-president of the Advanced Buddhist College of the Chinese Tibetan Language System, said: Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, except during the ten years of turmoil, the Party and the state have always attached great importance to Tibet's religious affairs. In particular, in the past ten years, various levels of government have allocated a lot of money to repair temples, respect the freedom of religious belief of the masses, and religious personnel can also devote themselves to religious activities. The state established the Advanced Buddhist College of the Chinese Tibetan Language System to train successors of Tibetan religion, which is unprecedented in Chinese history and fully reflects the Party and the government's attention to Tibetan religion. In the college, monks and high lamas from all over the country come to study various classics and specialized works of various sects, and at the same time, they actively edit and publish Tibetan literature and anthologies. The Tibetan encyclopedia "Danjur," under the efforts of the teachers and students of the college, has now been published in 50 volumes of 1,000 sets. At present, 115 Mongolian and Tibetan religious talents are studying and learning in this college.

	Dongga Losang Zhabdrung, a professor at Tibet University and a national-level expert, said: The development of Tibetan culture has gone through several periods: from the 3rd century BC to the 7th century AD, it was the period of the development of Tibetan primitive culture. From the 7th century during the reign of Songtsen Gampo to the 12th century, it was the period of rapid development of Tibetan culture, mainly absorbing and learning the excellent cultures of India, China, Arabia, and other nations. From the 12th century to the liberation, Tibetan culture was basically in a period of stagnation, adopting a closed-door policy towards modern culture. This was because the three great landlords controlled the economic lifeline of Tibet. They only cared about their own interests, fought with each other, and did not consider the future and rise and fall of the nation. After liberation and to this day, Tibetan national culture has developed greatly. The learning, use, and development of the Tibetan language have been strengthened, and the cultures of other nations have also begun to flourish. At the same time, modern culture and technology have also developed rapidly.

	Duojie Cairen, who once served as the chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government, said: Currently, dozens of Tibetan studies institutions have been established in Beijing, Tibet, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Gansu, forming a Tibetan studies team composed of Tibetans and other ethnic members, with a large number of Tibetan studies experts and scholars with profound knowledge. In 1986, the state allocated 25 million yuan in special funds to establish the China Tibetology Research Center in Beijing. The center has nine directors and deputy directors, seven of whom are Tibetans. Now, more than 100 Tibetan studies researchers and staff of the center are using modern means to comprehensively collate, collect, and publish Tibetan literature and various Tibetan studies monographs. Such a large-scale collection, collation, and publication of Tibetan cultural heritage has never been done in Tibet under any previous social system. In academic exchanges with the international Tibetan studies community, some experts and scholars from the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries told me that China's Tibetan studies are unparalleled by any other country; to rescue, protect, and develop Tibetan culture with such a large amount of manpower, material resources, and energy, no organization can do it, only the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has truly done it. Who is rescuing, protecting, and developing Tibetan culture? Anyone who is honest and fair-minded will not find it difficult to draw the above conclusion.

    青史如镜鉴是非
    ——专家学者谈西藏
    新华社记者　华民实
    最近，挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会向达赖喇嘛颁奖，法国纪念奖委员会将一项“人权奖”发给达赖，并声称是为了表彰达赖为和平和保护西藏文化所作出的贡献。对此，我国一些民族问题专家学者和宗教界知名人士对记者发表谈话指出，历史是不能歪曲的。大量的事实说明，西藏自和平解放特别是民主改革以来，社会政治、经济、文化等各方面都发生了巨大的变化。给西藏带来和平、进步、繁荣的，是中国共产党领导下的西藏人民和全国各族人民，而不是别的任何人和组织。西藏民族只有在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义祖国大家庭中才有光明的前途。
                谁是西藏和平的维护者
    中国民族理论学会理事长、著名民族问题专家牙含章说：1959年西藏人民在中国共产党的领导下胜利地完成了民主改革，废除了农奴制，获得了和平稳定的生产和生活环境。西藏在民主改革前是农奴制，这是一种最黑暗的社会制度。在这种制度下，西藏人民连最起码的人身自由都没有，哪有什么人权可讲？1959年在西藏各族群众的要求下，共产党在西藏全部废除了农奴制，进行了社会主义改造，这完全是顺乎历史和民意的正确抉择，受到了西藏各族人民的拥护。几十年来，从黑暗、残酷的农奴制煎熬下解放出来的百万翻身农奴享受着政治、经济、文化等各个方面与其他各民族平等的权利，沐浴着社会主义的雨露阳光，取得了令世界瞩目的建设成就，这是连达赖喇嘛都不得不承认的历史事实。
    在西藏工作和生活了半个世纪的中国藏学研究中心总干事多杰才旦说：我是研究西藏历史的，我深深感到，中国共产党领导下的民主改革是西藏千百年历史上划时代的深刻变革，是社会主义制度给西藏带来了真正的繁荣与和平。1959年我曾代表中央和政府在拉萨发放布施，乞丐来了八九千人，那时的拉萨，富丽堂皇的寺院全被大片的贫民窟包围着。约占西藏人口5％的农奴主阶级，即官家、贵族、寺庙上层僧侣三大领主，占有西藏的全部土地、草场和绝大部分牲畜，而占西藏人口90％以上的农奴阶级，依附于三大领主，没有自己的土地，也没有人身自由，生产力的发展受到极大束缚。而实行民主改革30年，广大农奴当家作主，西藏的社会经济、文化都取得了巨大的成就。 1988年与1959年相比，粮食增长了近3倍、牲畜总头数增长1.4倍，农牧业总产值增长3.9倍；现代工业从无到有，目前全区共有各类工业企业263个，工业总产值1988年达到2亿元。西藏人口1953年时是127万，1987年增长到207万，西藏人的平均寿命和平解放前是35.5岁，现在是63.7岁。这一切，都是西藏人民在党的领导下取得的。民主改革前，国外一些帝国主义分裂分子对西藏贵族说，你们可不要改革你们的农奴制，你们一改掉，世界上就没有农奴制了。他们就是要把西藏变成一个黑暗、腐朽的封建农奴制的博物馆。他们现在又在幕后策划西藏独立，就是为了把西藏从社会主义大家庭中分裂出去，让广大西藏人民重新回到过去的苦难中去。
    西藏社会科学院研究员恰白·次登平措在谈到分裂主义分子对西藏社会安定的破坏性时说：近年来拉萨发生的几次骚乱虽是境内外极少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造的，但其破坏、影响遍及整个西藏，干扰了全西藏人民安宁、幸福的生活环境，干扰了西藏经济的发展。国务院决定在拉萨地区实行戒严是及时的和必要的，这是为了保护广大藏族人民的切身利益，保障正常的生产、生活和学习环境。
              谁是西藏人民利益的代表者
    多杰才旦说：在过去的封建农奴制度下，西藏广大农奴没有任何人身权利可言，那时农奴们见了面，互相之间不是问你叫什么名字，而是问你的主人是谁。领主把农奴视为私有财产，被当作会说话的牲口，可以随意买卖、抵押或当作礼品相互转让，就连婚姻生育也要受农奴主干预，稍不如意，立刻遭到领主的严刑毒打，三大领主完全握有对农奴的生杀予夺大权。就拿教育来说，农奴连想都不要想。西藏那时也有学校，但都是私塾，能进校读书的全是官家、贵族的子弟，加起来也只有几百人。僧侣也并非都能学文化受教育，西藏当时有几千名喇嘛，真正能坐在那儿识字读经的只有15％，另外85％的喇嘛只有干活的份儿，其实都是穿着袈裟的奴隶。现在西藏已有各类学校2469所，在校生达16.5万多人。
    长期从事民族法研究的史筠教授说：党和政府为保障西藏各族群众真正行使当家做主的权利，先后制定了一系列法律法规。我国目前已初步形成了以宪法为基础，以民族区域自治法为主干，包括其他有关法律、法规和民族自治地方的自治条例、单行条例的民族法体系。这些法律有效地保障了各民族地区包括西藏各族群众的平等权利和自治权利以及参与全国各级政权的权利。我国少数民族人口占全国人口的6.7％，而少数民族中的全国人大代表占全国人大代表总数的14％。去年召开的西藏自治区第五届人民代表大会，藏族和其他少数民族代表占82.9％。自治区人大常委会产生以来，共通过和颁布地方性法规23个。宪法、民族区域自治法还规定民族区域自治地方政府主席必须由实行自治的民族干部担任。在西藏自治区区一级领导人中，藏族干部占83.9％，各级人大、政府和各地市党政一把手都由藏族同志担任。所有这一切，都是民族平等的真正体现，它充分保障了少数民族的政治权利，这是为世界上各多民族国家所公认的。
               谁是藏族文化的保护者
    北京图书馆馆长、著名宗教学专家任继愈说：佛教文化是整个中华民族文化的一个重要组成部分。而藏传佛教，即喇嘛教，在藏族文化中占有更重要的地位。党和政府对宗教文化一直是下大力保护的。例如，从1982年开始，国家每年拨出十几万、二十几万资金的专款用于整理出版《中华大藏经》（汉文部分），现在这部经典已出版了三十几卷，这部经典全部出齐共有220本，每本1000页，字数要以亿来计算，它将是世界上最全的一部佛教经典全集。从前年开始，《中华大藏经》（藏文部分），也开始了整理出版，这也将是一个浩繁的工程。这两项工作的完成，不仅对我国的藏学研究、宗教文化具有无法估量的益处，而且对世界文化也是巨大的贡献。在宗教研究方面，我们这几年的进步也是很大的。1982年，我们在大学开设了宗教研究专业，已培养出几届博士生，他们所写的论文引起了国际宗教研究界的注意。现在，日本研究佛教、道教，也都派人到我们这里来学习。当然，我们不否认在十年动乱期间，西藏地区的经济、文化遭受到很大的损失。但这不是汉族对少数民族的迫害，而是一场包括汉族在内的整个中华民族的灾难。
    中国藏语系高级佛学院副院长那仓·向巴昂翁活佛说：自西藏和平解放以来，除去十年动乱时期，党和国家对西藏的宗教事业一直是重视的。特别是最近十年里，各级政府拨了许多钱用以维修寺庙，尊重群众宗教信仰的自由，宗教界人士也可以潜心专一地从事宗教活动了。国家成立中国藏语系高级佛学院，培养西藏宗教的接班人，这在中国历史上也是没有过的，充分反映了党和政府对西藏宗教的重视。在学院里，来自全国蒙藏地区的活佛和高僧一面深入钻研各种经典和各教派的专著，一面积极编辑出版藏文文献、文选。被誉为藏族百科全书的大藏经《丹珠尔》，在学院师生的努力下现已出版了50卷共1000套。目前，已有115名蒙古族、藏族宗教人才在这个学院进修和学习。
    西藏大学教授、国家级专家东嘎·洛桑赤烈说：西藏文化的发展经历了几个时期：公元前二三百年到公元7世纪，是藏族原始文化发展时期。公元七世纪松赞干布时代到12世纪，是藏族文化迅速发展时期，主要是充分吸收学习印、汉、阿拉伯等民族的优秀文化。12世纪到解放前，西藏文化基本上处于固守时期，对现代文化采取了闭关自守的态度。这是因为三大领主操纵了西藏的经济命脉，他们只管自己的私利，互相争斗，根本不考虑民族的未来、民族的兴衰。解放后到现在，西藏民族文化有了很大的发展。藏语文的学习、使用、发展得到加强，其他民族文化也开始兴旺发展起来。与此同时，现代文化科技也有了很快的发展。
    曾经担任过西藏自治区人民政府主席的藏族学者多杰才旦说：目前，北京、西藏、四川、青海、甘肃等地建起了几十个藏学研究机构，形成了以藏族和其他民族成员组成的藏学研究队伍，拥有一大批造诣很深的藏学专家和学者。1986年，国家拨出专款2500万元，在北京建立了中国藏学研究中心。这个中心的总干事和副总干事共9人，其中7人是藏族。现在，这个中心的100多名藏学研究人员和工作人员依靠现代化的手段正着力全面整理、搜集、出版藏文文献及各种藏学专著。对藏族文化遗产进行这样大规模的搜集、整理和出版，在西藏过去任何社会制度下都是没有过的。在与国际藏学界的学术交流中，美国、联邦德国等国家的一些专家、学者对我说，中国的藏学研究，任何一个国家都望尘莫及；花这样大的人力、物力、精力去抢救、保护和发展藏族文化，任何一个组织都做不到，只有中国共产党领导下的中华人民共和国才真正做到了。究竟是谁在抢救、保护和发展藏族文化，任何人只要本着诚实、公正的态度都不难得出上述结论。
