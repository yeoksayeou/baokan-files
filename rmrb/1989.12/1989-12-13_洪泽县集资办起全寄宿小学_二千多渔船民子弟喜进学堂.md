	Fishing and boat-dwelling residents in Hongze Lake, China, no longer have to worry about their children's education. The full-boarding primary schools established by Hongze County through various funding channels have now started classes. Over 2,000 children of fishermen and boat dwellers, who previously drifted on the water and could not attend school, have begun to leave their boats and settle on land to study.

	In recent years, with the implementation of the fishery production responsibility system and the development of various forms of water transportation, the activity range of fishermen and boat dwellers in the lake area has gradually expanded. The former "boat-head schools" can no longer meet the needs of the new situation. Therefore, the Hongze County Party Committee and the county government have listed the establishment of full-boarding primary schools as an important task in the county's educational work, raising 400,000 yuan for the establishment of full-boarding primary schools throughout the county.

	The establishment of full-boarding primary schools has provided good learning conditions for the children of fishermen and boat dwellers. The classrooms of the full-boarding primary school in Laozishan Town are clean and tidy; the dormitories are equipped with mosquito nets, beds, water bottles, and other living facilities. In addition to having cooks to prepare meals for the children, the school also has nursery workers and health workers to take care of the students' diet, living conditions, and health.

	Liu Zhaofu, the head of the county's propaganda department, introduced that the enrollment rate of children in the lake area has now reached 93%, and the retention rate of students in school has reached 100%.

    洪泽县集资办起全寄宿小学
    二千多渔船民子弟喜进学堂
    本报讯　我国洪泽湖渔民、船民，如今不再为子女的上学问题发愁。洪泽县通过多种渠道集资兴办的全寄宿小学，目前已陆续开学，2000多名以前漂泊水上、无法入学的渔船民子弟开始离船上岸，定居陆地读书。
    近年来，由于落实了渔业生产责任制，发展了多种形式的水上运输事业，湖区渔民、船民活动范围日益扩大，过去的“船头学校”已远远不能适应新形势的需要。为此，洪泽县委、县政府将兴办全寄宿小学列为全县教育工作的一项重要任务，在全县筹集了兴办全寄宿小学所需的40万元资金。
    全寄宿小学的创办，给渔船民子女提供了良好的学习条件。老子山镇全寄宿小学教室里窗明几净，整洁卫生；宿舍里蚊帐、床铺、水瓶等生活设施一应俱全。学校除有炊事员给孩子们做饭外，还配备了保育员、保健员照顾学生的饮食起居、卫生健康。
    县委宣传部长刘兆富介绍说，目前湖区儿童的入学率已达93％，学生在校巩固率达到100％。　（谢龙祥）
