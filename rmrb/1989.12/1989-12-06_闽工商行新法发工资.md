A new method using demand drafts for interbank deposits and withdrawals has recently been promoted by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Fujian Province. Under this method, clients can withdraw cash not only at the bank where their unit has an account but also at any nearby Industrial and Commercial Bank savings outlet by presenting a demand draft they have issued.

In pilot areas such as Zhangping County and Sanming City within Fujian Province, statistics show that three grassroots banks currently handle over 400,000 yuan in salary payments monthly, with an average deposit retention rate of 30%. To date, no errors have occurred. A depositor vividly described the convenience, saying, "Savings outlets that can handle interbank deposits and withdrawals are like pawns that have crossed the river and become chariots." This method has also been endorsed by financial experts.

    闽工商行新法发工资
    本报讯　一种使用活期支票进行通存通兑的代发工资办法，最近在福建省工商银行推广。按照这一办法，客户除可以在单位统一开户的银行提取现金外，还可根据自己签发的活期支票，选择就近的工商银行储蓄所提取现金。
    在福建省工商银行试点的漳平县、三明市等地，据统计，仅三家基层银行目前月代发工资金额就达40多万元，平均留存存款达30％，迄今未出现差错。一位储户生动地说，储蓄所能够通存通兑，“就像小卒过河成了车”。这一办法也得到了金融界权威人士的肯定。　（谢少波）
