	The renowned Peking opera master and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zhang Junqiu, recently received the "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the "Chinese-American Arts Association" of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York, as well as the "Lincoln Arts Award" from San Francisco.

	The "Lifetime Achievement Award" is a special international award that was created for the first time. Alongside Zhang Junqiu, the Taiwanese Peking opera artist Gu Zhengqiu also received this honor. In the 1940s, Zhang Junqiu had taught Gu Zhengqiu the play "Han Mingfei." The fact that both teacher and student received this international award is quite extraordinary.

    张君秋荣获美国两项大奖
    本报讯  我国著名京剧艺术大师、中国文联副主席张君秋，最近荣获美国纽约林肯艺术中心“美华艺术协会”的“终生艺术成就奖”和旧金山“林肯艺术奖”。
    “终生艺术成就奖”，是首次破格特设的国际大奖。与张君秋先生同获此殊荣的，是台湾京剧艺术家顾正秋女士。四十年代，张先生曾给顾女士传授过《汉明妃》这出戏。师徒双双获此国际大奖，是很不寻常的。　（丁正良）
