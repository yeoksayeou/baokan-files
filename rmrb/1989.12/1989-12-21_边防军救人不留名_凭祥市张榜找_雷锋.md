Border defense soldiers from a certain unit in Guangxi rescued six local cadres who were in danger, displaying a spirit of doing good deeds without seeking recognition. Recently, the unit's party committee awarded them third-class merit citations. Pingxiang City held a commendation meeting, praising the border defense soldiers for being heroes who guard the border and models who learn from Leifeng.

On the morning of October 16, six cadres from the Pingxiang City People's Congress were on their way to Nanning for a meeting. When their van reached the Xiajishi Road Bridge, it accidentally flipped into a twelve-meter-deep pond, injuring all the cadres on board. At that moment, five soldiers from a certain border defense unit were passing by and immediately stopped to rescue them. The soldiers, despite their fatigue from the journey, jumped into the water without hesitation and brought the injured cadres to safety one by one. They then transported them to the Pingxiang City People's Hospital. After the soldiers carried the injured into the emergency room and ensured that doctors were conducting rescue efforts, they quietly left.

The cadres from the Pingxiang City People's Congress put up posters searching for the "living Leifeng" around the streets and at the entrances of military camps. Based on the clues, people quickly found the middle-grade lieutenant squad leader Li Sanbao and the soldiers Huang Fei, Cai Daizhen, Lin Wusun, and Zeng Zhiyong, who had rescued people without leaving their names.

    边防军救人不留名  凭祥市张榜找“雷锋”
    新华社南宁十二月十九日电　（记者李石元、通讯员于礼谦）广西边防某部五名官兵奋力抢救六名遇险地方干部，做好事不留名精神感人。最近，部队党委分别给他们记了三等功。凭祥市召开表彰大会，赞扬边防军“守边关当英雄，学雷锋是模范”。
    十月十六日上午，凭祥市人大的六名干部前往南宁开会。当他们乘坐的面包车行至夏石公路桥时，不慎翻入十二米深的水塘里，车上干部全部受伤。此时，边防某部五名官兵路过便立即停车搭救。干部、战士顾不得路途疲劳，纷纷跳入水中，把受伤的干部一一背上岸来。接着，用车送往凭祥市人民医院。他们把伤员抬进急救室，等医生进行抢救后才悄然离去。
    凭祥市人大的同志把寻找“活雷锋”的榜张贴在街头和部队营区门口。根据线索，人们很快找到了救人不留名的中尉排长李三宝和黄飞、蔡代振、林武孙、曾志勇四位战士。
