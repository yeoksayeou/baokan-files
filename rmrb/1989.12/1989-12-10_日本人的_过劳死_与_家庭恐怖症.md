The term "overwork death" is quite popular in Japan. Statistics show that in 1986, a Japanese person worked 2150 hours, compared to 1938 hours in the UK, 1924 hours in the US, and 1643 hours in France. In 1987, the hardworking Japanese people increased their working hours by another 18 hours, setting a new record for themselves. The Japanese are fanatical about work, making "overwork death" even more prevalent.

In 1988, 150 legal professionals held a meeting to discuss the issue of "overwork death." They estimated that in 1987, out of the 210,000 Japanese people who died from heart disease, at least 20% died from overworking for their companies. Japanese people frequently work overtime, with railway workers having the most overtime. A survey conducted last autumn on railway workers showed that they averaged 298 hours of overtime in 1987, with 10.6% of them working over 100 hours of overtime each month. In Tokyo, during the morning and evening rush hours, a shocking scene unfolds: passengers on the trains are dozing off, some even snoring. Some people are so focused on their work that they do not want to go home. These individuals have been diagnosed by Japanese psychiatrists with what is known as "family phobia."

Dr. Sekiya Michiteru believes that "family phobia" is similar to "overwork death" in that it is caused by excessive work, leading to a lack of interest in anything unrelated to their "work." Their minds are always on their companies. Such people have no hobbies, do not drink alcohol, and have no lovers.

    日本人的“过劳死”与“家庭恐怖症”
    “过劳死”这个词在日本很流行。有数字表明：1986年，一个日本人工作2150小时，英国为1938小时，美国为1924小时，法国为1643小时。1987年，顽强的日本人在原有工作时间上又增加了18小时，从而刷新了他们自己的纪录。日本人狂热地工作，因此，“过劳死”更加流行了。
    1988年，150名司法工作者开会讨论“过劳死”的问题。他们估计，1987年，在死于心脏病的21万名日本人中，至少有20％的人是“为自己的公司操劳过度”而死去的。日本人经常加班，铁路工人加班最多，去年秋天对铁路工人进行的调查表明，他们在1987年平均加班298小时，10.6％的铁路工人每月加班共计100小时。东京地铁在早晚呈现出一幅惊人的景象：乘客在车上都是昏昏欲睡，有的人甚至打鼾。有些人一心放在工作上，以致不想回家。他们得了日本精神病科医生称为的“家庭恐怖症”。
    关谷通医生认为，“家庭恐怖症”同“过劳死”一样，产生这种病是由于日本人工作过度，对与他们的“工作”无关的一切不感兴趣而造成的。他们心里想的是他们的公司。这种人没有业余爱好、不喝酒、没有情人。
