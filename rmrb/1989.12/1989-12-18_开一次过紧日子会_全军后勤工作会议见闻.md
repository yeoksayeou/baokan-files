The "logistics officers" of the People's Liberation Army have gathered to calculate how to tighten their belts.

The meeting is held in a hallway of the General Logistics Department's auditorium. Even the seats for senior generals like Zhao Nanqi and Liu Anyuan are ordinary chairs like those found in most homes. We asked, "The hotel has plenty of conference rooms, why use this hallway?" A colonel from the secretariat replied, "Hotel conference rooms are charged by the hour. This hallway is usually empty, and we calculated that using it for a few days would save at least 300,000 yuan!"

There are 42 generals and 32 colonels attending the meeting. Generals stay in single rooms, while other attendees share rooms. Whether generals or officers, everyone takes the bus from the hotel to the auditorium. Meals are served individually, with each person receiving two dishes of vegetables and two dishes of meat (no large fish or meat). The hotel manager felt it was too frugal and wanted to add more. Deputy Director Zong Shunliu said, "Don't do that. You are a Party member of the General Logistics Department, and I am the discipline inspector. If we violate the rules, both of us will be punished!" It is also stipulated that staff from the headquarters who attend the meeting must return home for meals and rest; those from units in Beijing who bring their own cars are not provided with meals for their drivers.

In the past two years, the army has engaged in production and management, all of which is overseen by these "logistics officers." They all have some "local specialties." Before the meeting, the General Logistics Department issued a strict order: no gifts are allowed in Beijing; if the headquarters accepts gifts from below, severe punishment will be meted out! The hotel staff told us, "Such meetings make the rooms the cleanest."

We tried to find a bulletin at the meeting, but there was none. Director Zhao Nanqi and Political Commissar Liu Anyuan discuss and learn with everyone every day, directly grasping the situation, so there is no need for a bulletin; the only thing given to everyone at the meeting is a manila envelope containing a few necessary documents.

Over the years, we have attended many meetings, but few have been as meticulously planned as this one. Attendees said: The meeting style of the Yan'an era has returned.

    开一次过紧日子会
    ——全军后勤工作会议见闻
    罗同松　王义华
    人民解放军的“粮草官”这两天坐在一起，拨拉算盘子，盘算如何过紧日子。
    会场设在总后勤部礼堂的一间过厅里，包括赵南起上将、刘安元中将坐的，都是如今普通家庭坐的那种椅子。我们问：“宾馆有的是会议室，干吗非要用这间过道不可？”秘书组一位大校答曰：“宾馆的会议室要按时计费。这个过厅反正空着，我们算了一下，在这里‘将就’几天，至少可省3万元！”
    会议人员中，有42位将军、32位大校。将军住单人房间，其他人员均为二人一室。从宾馆去礼堂，将军也好，校官、尉官也好，都集体乘车。吃饭为分餐制，每人两碟素菜，两碟荤菜（绝无大鱼大肉），宾馆领导人看着实在“寒碜”，想贴补一点。副部长宗顺留说：“你可不要干这种事。你是总后的党员，我是总后的纪委书记，违反规定，你我都要受处分！”这里还规定，机关参加会议者，一律回家就餐就寝；驻京单位来参加会议的人员带车来的，恕不招待司机就餐。
    这两年部队搞生产经营，均由这些“粮草官”们管着。他们手里或多或少都有点“土特产”。会议之前，总后勤部便下了一道“死命令”：不许带礼品进京；机关要是接受了下面礼物，严惩不贷！宾馆服务员告诉我们：“像这样的会议，房间最好打扫。”
    我们在会议上想找份简报看看，说没有。部长赵南起、政委刘安元每天和大家围成一圈，学习讨论，情况他们都直接掌握了，用不着再去搞简报；会议发给大家的，只有一个牛皮纸袋，里面装着几份必要的文件。
    这些年我们参加会议不少，像这样精打细算的会议却不多。参加会议的同志说：延安时代的会风回来了。
