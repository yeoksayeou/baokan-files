Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 19th.

The province of Jilin has organized a sales team of more than 10,000 people, using covered wagons, pushcarts, and peddlers' shoulder poles to bring more than 10,000 kinds of industrial products to mountain villages, grasslands, and grain-producing areas. The rural market in the entire province has entered the peak sales season.

When two mobile sales vehicles from the Changchun Department Store arrived at the Shanghewan market, which is at the junction of four counties—Jitai, Yushu, Dehui, and Shulan—people cheered, "The covered wagons have arrived!" and rushed to buy the 200-plus varieties of high-quality, new products they brought. A young farmer who arrived late regretted not being able to buy a "Yongjiu" brand bicycle. The staff from the department store promised to bring one next time. The sales vehicle manager told the reporter that they had already visited 30-plus markets in eight counties, with sales reaching over 1.3 million yuan. It is understood that more than 20 large department stores in various cities and towns in the province, as well as more than 100 rural supply and marketing cooperatives, have organized such mobile sales vehicles.

The provincial commerce department and the supply and marketing cooperative officials said that since early November, they have been deploying the purchase and sales work for the rural peak season market. The provincial and municipal wholesale stations for textiles, hardware, electrical appliances, chemicals, and cultural supplies have taken turns to hold exhibitions in various counties. In November, the provincial state-owned commerce supplied 13.9% more industrial products to rural supply and marketing cooperatives than in the same period last year. A batch of light industrial, textile, electronic, and household appliance factories have actively implemented profit-sharing and joint sales with rural supply and marketing cooperatives. They discovered that the once-neglected remote rural markets have a huge purchasing power. The agricultural production materials department has changed the traditional practice of supplying goods only during the spring plowing season and has launched a winter sales campaign for the first time. In November, the province sold 52,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 900 tons of agricultural plastic film, and 610,000 small and medium-sized agricultural tools to farmers.

    大篷车货郎担运货下乡
    吉林农村市场进入旺季
    新华社长春12月19日电  （记者赵玉庆）吉林省组织1万多人的销售队伍，开着大篷车，推着货床子、挑着货郎担，把上万种工业品送到山村、草原和粮食产区。全省农村市场开始进入销售旺季。
    当长春百货大楼的两台流动售货车开进九台、榆树、德惠、舒兰四县交界的上河湾集市时，人们欢呼大篷车来了，纷纷围上来选购他们带来的200余种名、优、新产品。一名迟来的青年农民为没有买到永久牌自行车惋惜，百货大楼的同志答应下次集市捎来。售货车负责人告诉记者，他们已到8个县的30多个集市赶集，销售额已达130多万元。据了解，全省各大中城市的20多家大型商店和农村上百家供销社都组织了这种流动售货车。
    省商业厅和供销合作社负责人说，从11月初就部署了农村旺季市场的购销工作。省、市的百货、纺织、五金、交电、化工、文化用品批发站联合轮流到各县举行展销会，11月份全省国营商业供应给农村供销社的工业品比去年同期增长了13.9％。一批轻工、纺织、电子、家用电器工厂主动与农村供销社实行让利联销。他们发现，一度被忽略的偏远农村市场潜藏着很大的购买力。农业生产资料部门改变过去在春季备耕时期才开始供货的传统，第一次开展了冬销活动，全省11月份售给农民化肥5.2万吨，农用薄膜900吨，中小农具61万件。
