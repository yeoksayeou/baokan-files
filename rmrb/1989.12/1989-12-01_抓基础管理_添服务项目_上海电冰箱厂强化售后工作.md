Shanghai Refrigerator Factory has made improving after-sales service a key part of its rectification and reorganization efforts, striving to win the trust of a broad range of users.

The establishment of repair networks is the foundation of after-sales service. Shanghai Refrigerator Factory has focused on the technical development of service centers and networks, strengthening the management of these institutions. Through several years of practice, the factory has established a complete set of management procedures and was the first in the industry to formulate a "After-Sales Service Management Manual," making service work systematic and institutionalized. At the same time, they placed repair networks under the supervision of society and users, distributing service opinion questionnaires to 33 consumer associations and 500 users nationwide, conducting network evaluations, and canceling those that do not meet the standards.

This year, the market showed signs of weakness, but the factory's "Shuanglu" brand refrigerators remained popular. Instead of being complacent, they introduced a series of distinctive services. In addition to adhering to the national "three guarantees" service regulations, they also went beyond the scope to exchange refrigerators with internal leaks that could not be repaired normally after the warranty period, following the proper procedures. Considering the needs of dual-income households, they launched evening home service in the Shanghai area to reduce the inconvenience of users taking time off to wait. For user letters, they ensured a response to each one, often replying on the same day, with a satisfaction rate of 99%.

    抓基础管理　添服务项目
    上海电冰箱厂强化售后工作
    本报讯　记者刘桂莲报道：上海电冰箱厂把完善售后服务作为治理整顿的一项重要内容来抓，努力使产品赢得广大用户的信赖。
    维修网点的建设是售后服务的基础。上海电冰箱厂狠抓了服务中心和网点的技术建设，加强对这些机构的管理。通过几年的实践，工厂设立了一套完整的管理办法，在同行业中率先制订了《售后服务管理手册》，使服务工作系统化、制度化。同时，他们把维修网点置于社会和用户的监督下，向全国33个消费者协会及500家用户分发了服务意见征询书，开展网点考评，不合格的予以取消。
    今年市场出现了疲软情况，而这家厂生产的“双鹿牌”冰箱依然畅销。他们没有以此为满足，新推行了一系列有特色的服务。在坚持国家“三包”规定服务之外，还超出范围，对包修期外无法正常修复的内漏冰箱，按手续办理调换。为双职工着想，在上海地区开展晚间上门服务，减少用户请假等候的不便。对用户来信，做到件件有回复，当天就回复，处理满意率达99％。
