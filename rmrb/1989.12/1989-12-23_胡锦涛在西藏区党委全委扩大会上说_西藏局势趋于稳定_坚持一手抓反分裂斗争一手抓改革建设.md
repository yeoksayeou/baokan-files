Today in the afternoon, Hu Jintao, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, gave a lengthy speech at the enlarged meeting of the third plenary session of the eighth committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, discussing the current situation in Tibet and the tasks at hand.

He believes that the overall situation in Tibet is good. Over the past year, the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Government, following the instructions from the Central Committee on work in Tibet, have been focusing on two major tasks: fighting splittism to stabilize the situation and promoting reform and construction. Although the Panchen Lama passed away early this year, and later there were severe riots in Lhasa and disturbances in some parts of the country, including the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, the situation in Tibet has gradually stabilized. Significant progress has been made in the fight against splittism, economic construction, spiritual civilization construction, and party building.

He said that since martial law was imposed in parts of Lhasa, the overall situation has quickly been brought under control. At all levels, the Party committees have mobilized and relied on the masses to expose the true facts of the Lhasa riots; to expose the crimes of the rioters in destroying national unity, social stability, and engaging in acts of violence, looting, arson, and murder; and to expose the conspiracies of foreign hostile forces interfering in China's internal affairs and attempting to separate Tibet from the motherland. This has effectively curbed the arrogance of the splittist forces. He said that both domestic and foreign splittist elements have repeatedly attempted to create riots in Lhasa. Due to the unity of cadres and masses of all ethnic groups in maintaining a stable and united political situation, their plots have failed.

He pointed out: The riots that have occurred in Lhasa since September 27, 1987, have both deep international and domestic backgrounds and deep social and historical roots. They are the result of planned, organized, and premeditated activities by domestic and foreign splittist elements with the support of foreign hostile forces. Their essence is a serious political struggle to split the country, oppose the Communist Party, and overthrow the socialist system. This struggle is a continuation of the long-standing struggle between splittism and anti-splittism in Tibet, and it is also a part of the struggle between international hostile forces and socialist countries in terms of infiltration and counter-infiltration, subversion and anti-subversion, and "peaceful evolution" and anti-"peaceful evolution."

He believes that Tibet currently faces two major issues: First, the situation in the fight against splittism is severe. The Dalai Lama group, with the support of international anti-China forces, is intensifying the creation of "Tibet independence" propaganda and influence internationally, while using various means and channels to conduct political infiltration within the region, attempting to create new riots. This determines the long-term, arduous, and complex nature of the struggle against splittism in Tibet. Second, Tibet's economic foundation is weak, severely constraining the development of Tibet's economy.

Based on this, he proposed that stabilizing the situation is the top political task for Tibet, and rectification and deepening reform are the focus of Tibet's economic work. He demands that policies must remain stable and continuous. Historical issues should not be dwelled upon or stirred up again. Thoughts should be unified, and efforts should be combined to get Tibet's affairs done well.

    胡锦涛在西藏区党委全委扩大会上说
    西藏局势趋于稳定
    坚持一手抓反分裂斗争一手抓改革建设
    本报拉萨12月22日电　记者卢小飞报道：今天下午，中共西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛在西藏区党委召开的三届八次全体委员扩大会上，就西藏目前的形势和面临的任务作了长篇发言。
    他认为西藏的形势总体上是好的。一年来，自治区党委和自治区人民政府根据中央关于西藏工作的指示，坚持一手抓反分裂斗争，稳定局势；一手抓改革、建设这两件大事。虽然年初班禅大师不幸圆寂，后来又发生了拉萨严重骚乱和全国部分地区的动乱、首都的反革命暴乱的严重局面，但西藏局势逐步趋于稳定，反分裂斗争、经济建设、精神文明建设和党的建设等各项工作都取得明显进展。
    他说，拉萨市部分地区实行戒严以来，整个局势迅速得到控制。各级党委发动和依靠群众，揭露拉萨骚乱的事实真相；揭露骚乱分子破坏祖国统一，破坏民族团结，破坏社会安定，搞打、砸、抢、烧、杀的种种罪行；揭露国外敌对势力干涉我国内政，妄图把西藏从祖国分裂出去的阴谋活动，有力打击了分裂势力的嚣张气焰。他说，境内外分裂主义分子曾多次妄图在拉萨制造骚乱。由于各族干部、群众团结一致，共同维护安定团结的政治局面，其阴谋未逞。
    他指出：1987年9月27日以来拉萨多次发生的骚乱事件，既有深刻的国际国内背景，又有深刻的社会历史根源，是境内外分裂主义分子在外国敌对势力的支持下，有计划、有组织、有预谋的活动，其实质是分裂祖国、反对共产党、颠覆社会主义制度的严重政治斗争。这场斗争，是西藏长期存在的分裂与反分裂斗争的继续，也是国际敌对势力同社会主义国家之间的渗透与反渗透、颠覆与反颠覆、“和平演变”与反“和平演变”斗争的组成部分。
    他认为，西藏当前面临两个突出问题：一是反分裂斗争的形势严峻。达赖集团在国际反华势力支持下，一方面加紧在国际上制造“西藏独立”的舆论和影响，另一方面采取各种方式，利用各种渠道对区内进行政治渗透，企图制造新的骚乱。这就决定了西藏分裂与反分裂斗争的长期性、艰巨性、复杂性。二是西藏经济基础脆弱，严重制约着西藏经济的发展。
    据此，他提出，稳定局势是西藏第一位的政治任务，治理整顿和深化改革是西藏经济工作的重点。他要求，必须保持政策的稳定性和连续性。对历史问题，不再纠缠，不再翻腾，统一思想，同心协力，把西藏的事情办好。
