"We urgently need some single-volume editions of Marx and Lenin's works, but we can't find them in bookstores, and they are hard to borrow from the library." Recently, Chen Feng, a second-year student in the Department of Politics at Nanjing University, told a reporter.

Carrying a list of Marx and Lenin's works provided by the students, the reporter visited the Xinhua Bookstore on Zhongshan East Road in Nanjing. In the Marx and Lenin section on the first floor, indeed, there were no single-volume editions.

How about the school library? Deputy Librarian Yang Keyi handed the reporter a statistical table of the borrowing situation of Marx and Lenin's works in recent years. He pointed to the table and explained that Nanjing University Library has a relatively large collection of Marx and Lenin's original works, but due to the borrowing volume in October breaking the record for the same period in recent years, some books may not be available for a while.

Program Director Chen Wenbao said, "We are currently compiling a list of books and plan to have the school printing factory print a batch to meet the needs as much as possible. At the same time, we are also preparing to organize a school-wide reading competition."

    南大踊跃学马列  书店急缺单行本
    据新华社南京电  （记者郑战国）“我们急需一些马列著作单行本，可书店里买不到，图书馆里也不易借到。”日前，南京大学政治系二年级学生陈锋对记者说。
    带着学生们讲的一串马列著作的书目，记者走访了南京中山东路新华书店。在书店一层的马列专柜里，果然没有见到单行本。
    学校图书馆又是怎样呢？副馆长杨克义递给记者一份近年来马列著作借阅情况统计表。他指着表格解释说，南京大学图书馆的马列原著还是比较多的，但由于10月份的借阅量打破了近年来的同期纪录，有的书籍就可能一时借不到。
    校党委宣传部部长程文保说，我们正在拟定书目，准备由学校印刷厂印刷一批，尽量满足需要。同时，也准备组织全校性的读书竞赛活动。
