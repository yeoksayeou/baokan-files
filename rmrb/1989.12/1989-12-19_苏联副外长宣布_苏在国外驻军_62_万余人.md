Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, December 15th - (Reporter Qian Wenrong) Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Petrovsky announced today at the United Nations that the Soviet Union currently has 627,500 troops stationed abroad and will withdraw all of them by the year 2000.

This is the first time the Soviet Union has publicly disclosed the number of its troops stationed abroad. Petrovsky said at a press conference that he was authorized to make this announcement in response to a request from the United Nations. The United Nations has requested all member states to disclose the number of their troops stationed in other countries.

Petrovsky said that it is well known that Soviet troops are stationed in Warsaw Pact countries and Mongolia. However, he refused to discuss whether the Soviet Union might withdraw troops from Eastern Europe. He said that this issue will be discussed in Vienna negotiations.

Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze will meet with the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization next week in Europe. Diplomats in the United Nations believe that the Soviet Union's disclosure of its troop numbers abroad is aimed at paving the way for the Soviet foreign minister's meeting.

    苏联副外长宣布
    苏在国外驻军62万余人
    新华社联合国12月15日电　（记者钱文荣）苏联副外长彼得罗夫斯基今天在联合国宣布，苏联目前在国外的驻军有62.75万人，苏联将在2000年前把他们全部撤回。
    这是苏联第一次公布它在国外驻军的人数。彼得罗夫斯基在记者招待会上说，他受权作此宣布，是响应联合国的请求。联合国要求所有成员国公布它们驻扎在别国的军队数目。
    彼得罗夫斯基说，苏联军队驻扎在华沙条约国家和蒙古是众所周知的。但他拒绝讨论苏联是否可能从东欧撤军的问题。他说，这一内容将在维也纳谈判中进行讨论。
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽下星期将与北大西洋公约组织的领导人在欧洲进行会晤。联合国的外交界人士认为，苏联宣布其驻外兵力人数旨在为苏联外长的这次会晤铺平道路。
