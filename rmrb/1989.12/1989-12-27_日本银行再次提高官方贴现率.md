The Bank of Japan announced on the 25th that it will raise the current official discount rate of 3.75 percent by 0.5 percentage points effective immediately. This is the third time this year that Japan has raised the official discount rate.

Japan's economy has been steadily growing this year. Workers' wages are also increasing. This situation has begun to lead to rising prices. A Bank of Japan official explained that the purpose of this rate hike is to prevent inflation caused by rising prices.

The Bank of Japan has already raised the official discount rate twice this year, on May 31 and October 11. In just half a year, the official discount rate has risen from its historic low of 2.5 percent to 4.25 percent, returning to the level seen in the spring of 1986 when the yen was weak.

After the Bank of Japan announced the rate hike, the exchange rate of the yen in the Japanese foreign exchange market rose slightly, reaching 141.95 yen to the dollar at one point, compared to the closing rate of 143.67 yen to the dollar at the end of last week.

    日本银行再次提高官方贴现率
    日本银行二十五日宣布从即日起，把现行的百分之三点七五的官方贴现率提高零点五个百分点。这是日本今年第三次提高官方贴现率。
    日本经济今年持续稳定增长。职工工资也在增加。这一状况开始导致物价上升。日本银行负责人解释，这次提高官方贴现率是为了预防物价上涨而导致通货膨胀。
    日本银行已于五月三十一日和十月十一日两次提高官方贴现率。仅在半年时间里，官方贴现率已由历史最低点百分之二点五提高到百分之四点二五，恢复到一九八六年春日元不景气时的水平。
    日本银行宣布提高官方贴现率后，日本外汇市场的日元比价有所上升，一时达到一百四十一点九五日元兑换一美元，而上周末的收盘比价是一百四十三点六七日元兑换一美元。
