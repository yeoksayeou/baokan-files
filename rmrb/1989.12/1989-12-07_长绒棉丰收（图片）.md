The northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, once a vast wasteland, has now become the home of long-staple cotton. In the late 1950s, tens of thousands of soldiers from the First Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps were sent here. They carried forward the spirit of Nanyuan, and after more than 30 years of hard work, they reclaimed over a million mu of farmland with their own hands.

This area has little rain throughout the year, long hours of sunshine, and a large temperature difference between day and night, making it suitable for the growth of long-staple cotton. The First Division, in response to the country's needs, fully utilized the geographical advantages and vigorously developed the production of long-staple cotton. The long-staple cotton produced here has strong stalks, large bolls, white lint, and long fibers. Each year, over 300,000 dan of cotton is exported to Western Europe and Southeast Asia, accounting for more than 70% of the national export volume, and enjoys a high reputation in the international market. This year, 455,000 mu of cotton was harvested, with an average yield of 58.3 kilograms of lint per mu, an increase of 21.4% over the previous year. The total production was 530,000 dan, an increase of 22.9% over the highest historical year of last year. The photo shows the cotton drying field of the 10th Brigade, 10th Company.

    长绒棉丰收
    塔克拉玛干大沙漠北缘，原是茫茫荒原，如今成了长绒棉的故乡。50年代末，新疆生产建设兵团农一师数万名军垦战士奉命来到这里。他们发扬南泥湾精神，经过30多年艰苦奋斗，用双手开垦出100多万亩耕地。
    这里长年少雨，日照时间长，昼夜温差大，适合长绒棉生长。农一师根据国家需要，充分利用地理优势，大力发展长绒棉生产。这里产的长绒棉，株壮铃大、絮白绒长，每年有30多万担销往西欧和东南亚，占全国出口总量的70％以上，在国际市场享有盛誉。今年45.5万亩棉花又获丰收，亩产皮棉58.3公斤，比上年提高21.4％，总产53万担，比历史最高年份的去年增长22.9％。图为十团十连晒花场。
