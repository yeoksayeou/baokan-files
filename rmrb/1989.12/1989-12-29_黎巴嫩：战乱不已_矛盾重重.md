Lebanon has been plagued by endless conflict and frequent disasters throughout 1989.

Following the consecutive failures of the presidential and parliamentary speaker elections in the autumn of last year, Lebanon found itself in a state of political crisis, with no president and a government divided between the Christian military government led by General Michel Aoun and the Muslim Sunni-led cabinet headed by Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss. This crisis is the most severe since Lebanon's independence in 1943.

Since March 7 of this year, Aoun's government forces have engaged in the largest-scale armed conflict in five years with Syrian troops, pro-Syrian Muslim forces, and Islamic militia in Beirut and other areas. Under the mediation efforts of the Arab League's Tripartite Committee, the conflicting parties reached a ceasefire on September 23. After 23 days of intense debate and negotiation, the two major sectarian representatives in the Lebanese parliament reached an agreement in the Saudi city of Taif on October 22, adopting the "National Reconciliation Document." Based on this document, Elias Hrawi, a member of the Maronite Christian sect, was elected president on November 5. However, Hrawi was assassinated just 17 days into his presidency. Two days later, Hrawi's fellow Maronite, René Moawad, was elected president by the Lebanese parliament. The government led by al-Hoss was also promptly established. However, Aoun's military government firmly opposed the Taif Agreement and the subsequent presidential election. After taking office, Hrawi stated that he would not hesitate to use force to end the conflict and on November 28, he dismissed Aoun from his position as commander of the armed forces. Currently, Lebanon is on the brink of a severe crisis.

In the midst of this confusing situation, Lebanon's historical political and sectarian conflicts have evolved further in the context of complex international dynamics:

1. The political interests of the two major sects and the national conflict between Lebanon and Syria are intertwined, making the Lebanese crisis even more intractable. The Christian sect generally believes that the root of Lebanon's problems lies in the presence of foreign troops, hence their persistent demand for Syrian withdrawal. Aoun referred to the March conflict as a "liberation war," calling for the intervention of the United Nations and other international bodies to "internationalize" the Lebanese issue. The various Muslim sects, however, view the Syrian presence in Lebanon as legal and necessary. They believe that the core of the Lebanese issue lies in the political system. They advocate for the sharing of national power according to the changing sectarian population, altering the historical dominance of the Christian sect over the country's political affairs. The Christian side insists on the withdrawal of foreign troops before conducting political reforms. The Muslim side, however, fears that if the Syrian troops withdraw, the militarily powerful Christian sect will disregard political system reforms. The Taif Agreement document largely met the Muslim side's demands for political interests, but Aoun's military government strongly opposed the document because it did not specify a timetable for the final withdrawal of Syrian troops. Both sides remain inflexible on this key issue, contributing significantly to the escalation of the Lebanese crisis.

2. The internal conflicts within and between the Lebanese sects have further complicated the situation. In early 1989, the "Amal" movement and the "Hezbollah" militia, both belonging to the Shia Muslim sect, clashed again in the Tufail region due to differing political views. In mid-February, the government forces and the "Lebanese Forces" militia, both belonging to the Christian sect, also engaged in armed conflict over territorial control. The reactions to the Taif Agreement varied among different factions. Al-Hoss's Muslim cabinet welcomed the agreement. However, the Progressive Socialist Party, the "Amal" movement, and the "Hezbollah," all belonging to the Islamic sect, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the agreement from their respective political interests. The Christian sect had more pronounced disagreements over the Taif Agreement. Aoun's Christian military government strongly opposed the agreement, even vowing to "fight to the death" rather than surrender. However, Hrawi, who also belongs to the Maronite Christian sect, was elected on the basis of implementing the Taif Agreement. After taking office, the new president repeatedly pressured Aoun to quickly remove obstacles to national unity. The various sects and factions, each with their own armed forces, frequently resort to violence to protect their interests, resulting in the repeated disruption of the fragile peace in Lebanon.

3. The complex international background behind the various factions is hindering Lebanon's national reconciliation process. Israel continues to maintain a so-called "security zone" in southern Lebanon, frequently launching military attacks or provoking hostage crises. Due to Syria's support for Iran during the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq supports Aoun's military government in opposing the Syrian presence in Lebanon. Syria, however, states that Syrian troops will only withdraw from Lebanon "when political reforms are achieved and Israel completely withdraws from Lebanese territory."

Throughout the year, the international community, particularly the Arab League's Tripartite Committee, has made significant efforts towards Lebanese national reconciliation and achieved positive results, which have been widely supported by the international community. The Lebanese people, after enduring 15 years of war, are weary and yearn for peace. However, due to the complex and intertwined interests of the various factions, the gaps between them are difficult to bridge quickly. Therefore, the path to genuine national reconciliation and domestic peace in Lebanon remains long and arduous.

    黎巴嫩：战乱不已  矛盾重重
    温宪
    一九八九年的黎巴嫩战乱不已，灾难频仍。
    黎巴嫩总统、议长选举于去年秋相继失败后，形成国家无总统和以政府军司令奥恩为首的基督教军政府同以穆斯林逊尼派领袖胡斯为代总理的内阁分庭抗礼的局面。黎巴嫩陷入一九四三年独立以来最严重的政治危机。
    自今年三月七日始，奥恩政府军与叙利亚军队及亲叙穆斯林军队、伊斯兰教派民兵在贝鲁特等地爆发了五年来规模最大的武装冲突。在阿盟三方委员会等极力斡旋下，冲突各方于九月二十三日实现了停火。黎巴嫩两大教派议员经过二十三天的激烈争论和讨价还价，于十月二十二日在沙特塔伊夫城达成协议，通过了
  “全国和解文件”，并根据文件于十一月五日选举属于基督教马龙派的穆瓦德为黎巴嫩总统。十一月二十二日，就任仅十七天的穆瓦德遭暗杀身亡。两天后，同属马龙派的赫拉维被黎议会推选出任总统。以胡斯为首的政府也随即宣告成立。但奥恩军政府坚决反对塔伊夫协议及其后的总统选举。赫拉维总统就任后表示为了结束战乱局面，他将不惜诉诸武力，并于十一月二十八日解除了奥恩武装部队总司令一职。目前，黎巴嫩正处于剑拔弩张的危机中。
    在扑朔迷离的局势演变中，黎巴嫩历史上的政治、教派等矛盾在复杂的国际背景下今年又有了新的发展：
    一、两大教派之间的政治利益矛盾与黎叙之间国家矛盾交织在一起，使黎巴嫩危机更趋棘手。基督教派大都认为黎巴嫩问题的产生主要是因为外国军队的存在，所以一直要求叙利亚从黎撤军。奥恩称三月初开始的冲突是“解放战争”，呼吁联合国等进行干预，促使黎巴嫩问题“国际化”。而穆斯林各教派则认为叙在黎驻军是合法和必要的。他们认为黎问题的症结在于政治体制问题。他们主张按变化了的教派人口数量分享国家权力，改变历史上形成的基督教派执掌国家政治命脉的特殊地位。基督教一方坚持主张先撤出外国军队，再进行政治改革。穆斯林方面则担心，叙军一旦撤走，军事实力强大的基督教派会置政治体制改革于不顾。塔伊夫会议文件基本上满足了穆斯林方面对政治利益的要求，而奥恩军政府则因为文件没有规定叙利亚最后撤军的时间表而激烈反对。双方在这一焦点问题上互不让步，成为黎危机愈演愈烈的重要原因。
    二、黎巴嫩教派之间及各教派内部矛盾进一步发展，使得黎巴嫩局势更加错综复杂。今年年初，同属穆斯林什叶派的“阿迈勒”运动和“真主党”民兵因政见不合在图法赫地区再次大动干戈。二月中旬，同属基督教派的政府军同“黎巴嫩力量”民兵组织为争夺势力范围也发生武装冲突。对于塔伊夫会议达成的协议，各方反应不一。胡斯领导的穆斯林内阁对协议表示欢迎。但同属伊斯兰教派的社会进步党、“阿迈勒”运动和“真主党”则从各自政治利益出发，对协议表示强烈不满。基督教派内部对塔伊夫协议的意见分歧更为明显。奥恩领导的基督教军政府对协议表示激烈反对，甚至“不惜战死”，也决不屈服。而与奥恩同属基督教马龙派的赫拉维总统却是在实施塔伊夫协议的基础上选举产生的。这位新总统上任后不断向奥恩施压，力图尽快消除国家统一的障碍。拥有各自武装力量的各教派及派系为维护本派权益，动辄诉诸武力，结果使黎巴嫩几度出现的和解局面一再遭到破坏。
    三、各派势力背后复杂的国际背景牵制着黎巴嫩民族和解进程。以色列至今仍在黎南部边境保持一个所谓“安全区”，经常对黎巴嫩进行军事袭击或挑起人质危机。由于叙利亚在两伊战争中支持伊朗，伊拉克支持奥恩军政府反对叙利亚在黎巴嫩驻军。而叙利亚则表示只有当黎“实现了政治改革，以色列全部撤出黎巴嫩领土之时”，叙军才“没有必要呆在黎巴嫩”。
    今年以来，国际社会特别是阿盟三方委员会为黎巴嫩的民族和解做出了巨大的努力，并取得了积极的成果，他们的努力得到国际社会的广泛支持。黎巴嫩人民历经长达十五年的战乱已疲惫不堪，人心思和。但由于各派利害矛盾错综复杂，各派间鸿沟很难迅速填平。因此，真正实现黎巴嫩民族和解和国内和平的道路仍是漫长曲折的。
