On a Sunday in December, more than 80 students from Hebei University of Light Industry, carrying the school flag and a sign reading "University Student Service Team for the People," went to the Shijiazhuang Railway Station to clean, carry luggage, and assist passengers, carrying out services for the public.

The university's student service team for the people was established nine years ago in 1981. At that time, six students used their spare time to help out at the railway station. After this initiative spread throughout the school, more and more students signed up to join the service team, and it has now become a school-wide activity. Whenever there is a holiday, the students take turns going to the railway station to provide services.

    河北轻化工学院大学生利用节假日为群众服务
    据新华社石家庄电　（记者杨树勋、刘英茹）十二月的一个星期天。河北轻化工学院八十多名学生举着校旗和“大学生为民服务队”的标牌，到石家庄火车站打扫卫生、搬运行李、接送旅客，开展为民服务活动。
    这所学校的大学生为民服务队成立于九年前的一九八一年。当时有六名大学生利用业余时间到火车站帮助服务。这件事在学校传开后引起很大反响，报名参加服务队的人越来越多，现在已成为全校性的活动。每逢节假日，学生们就轮流到火车站开展服务。
