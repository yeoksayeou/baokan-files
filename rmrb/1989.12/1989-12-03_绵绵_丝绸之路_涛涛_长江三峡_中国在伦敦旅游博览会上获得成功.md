At the expo, the 82 lanterns hanging in the Chinese pavilion were particularly eye-catching. The Terracotta Warriors and ancient bronze chariots on display were rich in cultural heritage and distinctively Chinese. This year, the theme of the Chinese pavilion was the "Silk Road" and the "Three Gorges of the Yangtze." Tourism professionals from Beijing, Shanghai, Sichuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, and Guangdong introduced the local customs, people, and the thriving tourism industry to visitors.

Many tourism professionals from the UK, Northern Europe, North America, and other parts of the world visited the Chinese pavilion to discuss business and explore cooperation opportunities. Many visitors eagerly collected materials and souvenirs. A British woman remarked, "China is an ancient and mysterious Eastern power. Traveling to China is a lifelong dream for many Britons. I will definitely go to China next year!"

According to statistics, over 100 travel agencies held business discussions with various Chinese exhibitors, and some even reached preliminary agreements.

Deputy Director-General of the National Tourism Administration, Gu Shubao, told reporters that this expo demonstrated China's enduring appeal to foreign tourists. China is stable and safe, with friendly and hospitable people, rich culture, and beautiful scenery, making it a worthwhile destination. He believes that this expo will have a significant impact on restoring China's tourism image and encouraging foreign tourists to return to China.
