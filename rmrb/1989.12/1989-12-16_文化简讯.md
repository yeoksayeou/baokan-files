The magazine *People's Military Doctor*, which was named by Marshal Zhu De and is highly regarded by military doctors as a mentor and friend, will be publicly distributed starting with the first issue of 1990, following approval by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and the State Press and Publication Administration. Yang Shangkun personally inscribed the title "People's Military Doctor." Nie Rongzhen's inscription reads: "Publish a good *People's Military Doctor* magazine to popularize military medical knowledge." Other inscriptions were provided by Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Nanqi, Chi Haotian, and Chen Minzhang.

To support the current campaign against the "Four Pests" and to deepen the "anti-pornography" efforts, the book *"New Compilation on Anti-Pornography: Policies, Regulations, Experiences, and Cases"* will be published by the Legal Publishing House in January 1990. The book, which is 240,000 words in length, includes important speeches by central leaders and articles by provincial and municipal party secretaries summarizing and researching the "anti-pornography" situation in their regions. It also contains documents and regulations from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and relevant departments regarding the rectification and cleanup of the book, newspaper, and audio-visual markets.

The book *"The Legend of Li Kenong"* has recently been published by Anhui People's Publishing House. This book vividly describes Li Kenong's legendary experiences throughout his life with a wealth of facts.

More than 400 people from various sectors in the capital gathered in Beijing on the 15th to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, a world-renowned cultural figure and the creator of Esperanto. Nie Rongzhen inscribed: "Learn Esperanto, promote people's friendship, and advance world peace." In 1887, the 28-year-old Polish ophthalmologist Dr. Zamenhof self-published *"The First Book,"* officially announcing the Esperanto plan. Since then, humanity has had a language that can be commonly used. Over the past century, Esperanto has gradually been recognized and accepted by people. The number of Esperanto workers in China has grown to over 400,000. This commemorative meeting was jointly initiated and organized by the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO, and 14 other organizations.

A set of encyclopedias for young children, *"The Little Doctor Library,"* was recently published in Beijing. This set of extracurricular children's books, published by Hebei Education Publishing House, is divided into two categories: natural sciences and social sciences. Fifteen volumes have been published, with plans to edit and publish 100 volumes.

A large-scale series *"Contemporary Heroes"* has recently been published and distributed by the Chinese Youth Publishing House. This book, consisting of over a million words in two volumes, includes the inspiring stories of 87 factory managers and directors from Guangdong Province.

The first social educational film on funeral themes in the 40 years of New China, *"Funeral Under the Pyramid,"* has been produced by the China Agricultural Film Studio. On December 15, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Honorary Chairman of the China Funeral Association Yang Jingren and others viewed the film.
