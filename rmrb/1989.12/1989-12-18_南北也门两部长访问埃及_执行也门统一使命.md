Ministers from North and South Yemen Visit Egypt to Carry Out Mission of Yemeni Unity

    CAIRO, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) — The Minister of State for Unification Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Rashid Mohammed Sabit, who is currently visiting Egypt, said that the recent steps taken by the two Yemens for unification are fundamental steps towards pan-Arab unity.

    Sabit made these remarks after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this morning. He said that the unification of the two Yemens needs Mubarak's assistance, as Egypt plays a "prominent" role in Middle East issues.

    The Minister of State for Yemeni Unification of the Yemen Arab Republic, Yahya Hussein Al-Hishi, also participated in the meeting.

    Al-Hishi said that he came to Egypt to brief Mubarak on the recent summit meeting held in Aden by the leaders of the two Yemens. He said that the unification of Yemen would help solve many problems and have a positive impact on Middle East security.

    It is reported that Mubarak also received letters today from the President of the Yemen Arab Republic, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party, Ali Salem al-Baid, regarding the unification of the two Yemens.

    南北也门两部长访问埃及
    执行也门统一使命
    新华社开罗12月16日电　正在这里访问的民主也门统一事务国务部长拉希德·穆罕默德·萨比特说，两个也门最近为统一采取的步骤是泛阿拉伯团结的基本步骤。
    萨比特今天上午会见埃及总统穆巴拉克后说，两个也门的统一需要穆巴拉克的帮助，因为埃及在中东问题上起着“突出”的作用。
    阿拉伯也门负责也门统一的国务部长叶海亚·侯赛因·阿尔希也参加了会见。
    阿尔希说，他来埃及是向穆巴拉克介绍两个也门的领导人最近在亚丁举行首脑会议的情况。他说，也门取得统一将有助于解决许多问题，对中东的安全产生积极因素。
    据悉，穆巴拉克今天还分别收到了阿拉伯也门总统阿里·阿卜杜拉·萨利赫和民主也门社会党中央委员会总书记阿里·萨利姆·比德关于两个也门统一的信件。
