    The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Ministry of Commerce have jointly issued a document to strengthen settlement discipline. State-owned commercial enterprises are not allowed to arbitrarily refuse to pay for goods.

    According to a report by our reporter Pan Gang, in response to some enterprises taking advantage of the current widespread "debt chain" to unreasonably refuse to pay for goods and disrupt the settlement order, Liu Tinghuan, vice president of the ICBC, recently emphasized at a meeting that all levels of banks must strengthen the settlement discipline for goods payments.

    Liu Tinghuan said that since the end of last year, the collection and payment settlement method, which had been used for many years, was canceled. The collection settlement method has been widely promoted, and the scope of the bill acceptance settlement method is also expanding. However, in the current context of a sluggish market and tight funds, due to the lack of a sound legal system for goods payment in our country's commodity purchasing and selling activities, there is a lack of a set of strict measures for pursuing, penalizing, and compensating enterprises that default on debts and delay repayment. The funds of many key large and medium-sized enterprises are being eroded by numerous delinquent accounts.

    In response to the above situation, the ICBC has recently jointly issued a document with the Ministry of Commerce, emphasizing that the settlement of goods payments between state-owned commercial enterprises must be handled in accordance with commodity purchasing and selling contracts and that goods payments must not be arbitrarily refused. For enterprises with tight funds, with the agreement of the supplier, "bank acceptance drafts" or "commercial acceptance drafts" with a maximum acceptance period of two months can be processed. It is forbidden to use the excuse of no funds to disrupt the settlement order, and it is even more forbidden for banks to delay or accumulate settlement vouchers, or to retain customers' settlement funds in various forms. This practice of commercial enterprises will gradually be promoted in production, materials, and other enterprises.

    工商银行同商业部联合发文
    强化货款结算纪律
    国营商业企业不得无故拒付货款
    本报讯　记者潘岗报道：针对一些企业趁目前“债务链”普遍存在之机无理拒付货款、扰乱结算秩序的现象，中国工商银行副行长刘廷焕日前在一次会议上强调，各级银行要强化货款结算纪律。
    刘廷焕说，自去年底取消延用多年的托收承付结算方式后，委托收款结算方式已在较大范围内铺开，票据承兑结算方式的推广面也在进一步扩大。但是，在目前市场疲软、资金紧张的特殊情况下，由于我国商品购销活动中有关货款支付的法制尚不健全，对欠帐耍赖、还债无期的企业缺乏一套追索、处罚、赔偿等严厉制裁措施，一些大中型骨干企业的资金被众多拖欠户蚕食。
    针对上述情况，中国工商银行最近已与商业部联合发文，强调国营商业企业间货款结算必须按商品购销合同办事，不得无故拒付货款；资金紧缺的经供货方同意，可办理不超过两个月承兑期的“银行承兑汇票”或“商业承兑汇票”，禁止以无款为由，把结算秩序搞乱，更不准银行延误和积压结算凭证，或以各种形式截留客户的结算资金。商业企业实行的这一做法，将逐步在生产、物资及其它企业中推开。
