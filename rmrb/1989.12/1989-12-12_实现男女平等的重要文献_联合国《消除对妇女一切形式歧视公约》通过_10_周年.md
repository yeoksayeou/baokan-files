This year's December 18 marks the 10th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Convention was unanimously adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979 and came into effect on September 3, 1981. To date, two-thirds of the UN member states have become parties to the Convention. China signed the Convention on July 7, 1980, becoming one of the first signatories.

The adoption of the Convention is a significant achievement of the "Decade for Women" (1976-1985) initiated by the United Nations, marking a major breakthrough in eliminating discrimination against women and achieving gender equality.

The Convention consists of a preamble and 30 articles, with the main contents including:

Requiring countries to abolish constitutional provisions that discriminate against women, ensuring that the principle of gender equality is integrated into all laws, and taking measures to eliminate the traditional bias of male superiority and female inferiority, guaranteeing that women can fully develop in all fields; ensuring that women can participate equally in the political and public affairs of their countries and granting women the same rights as men to acquire or change nationality; urging all signatory countries to take all necessary measures to eliminate various forms of discrimination against women; and requiring that women have equal status with men in legal matters and in all matters related to marriage and family.

The Convention also stipulates the establishment of the "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women" to review the implementation of the Convention by various countries.

In October 1982, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, the "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women," composed of 23 experts, held its first regular meeting in Vienna and elected its leadership. The establishment of the Committee is considered a major step in implementing the Convention, marking the entry of the long-term struggle for women's equal participation in the development process into a new stage.

Over the past 10 years, under the guidance of the Convention, signatory countries have taken corresponding measures domestically to eliminate discrimination against women and ensure gender equality. Most developing countries have established national specialized agencies to promote the improvement of women's status and their full participation in the social and economic development of the country. Women's rights have been protected by law, and the number of women participating in politics and public affairs, receiving education, and employed has increased.

On the other hand, a common problem encountered in the implementation of the Convention is the significant gap between legal equality and actual equality, which is closely related to old traditions and social biases. In developing countries, the idea of male superiority and female inferiority still has considerable influence, and the severe economic situation greatly hinders the improvement of women's status. Therefore, to turn the provisions of the Convention into reality, it will require a long-term struggle by the international community and women in various countries.

    实现男女平等的重要文献
    ——联合国《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》通过10周年
    陈永伶
    今年的12月18日，是联合国《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》通过10周年纪念日。该《公约》于1979年在联大一致通过，1981年9月3日开始生效。迄今，联合国2／3的会员国已成为该《公约》的缔约国。我国于1980年7月签署该《公约》，成为其首批签署国之一。
    《公约》的通过是1976年至1985年间联合国开展的
  “妇女十年”的重大成果之一，是消除对妇女的歧视、实现男女平等的重大突破。
    《公约》由序言和30项条款组成，其主要内容有：
    要求各国废除宪法中歧视妇女的条款，把男女平等的原则贯穿于所有法律中，并采取措施消除男尊女卑的世俗偏见，保证妇女在各个领域得到充分发展；保证妇女平等参与本国的政治和公众事务、并给予妇女与男子同样的取得或改变国籍的权利；敦促各缔约国采取一切措施消除对妇女的各种歧视；要求给予妇女在法律面前和在所有与婚姻和家庭有关的事务上与男子平等的地位。
    《公约》还规定设立
  “消除对妇女歧视委员会”，以审查各国执行《公约》的情况。
    1982年10月，根据《公约》有关的规定，由23名专家组成的“消除对妇女歧视委员会”在维也纳举行了第一次常会，选出了领导机构。该委员会的设立被认为是贯彻《公约》的一大进步，标志着争取妇女平等参与发展过程的长期斗争进入了新的阶段。
    10年来，在《公约》精神的推动下，各缔约国都在国内采取了相应措施，以消除对妇女的歧视和保证男女平等。大多数发展中国家都设立了全国性的专门机构，来促进妇女地位的提高和充分参与国家的社会和经济发展，妇女的权利受到了法律的保护，妇女参与政治和公众事务、受教育和就业的人数都有所增加。
    另一方面，在执行《公约》的过程中，各缔约国遇到的共同问题是，法律上的平等与事实上的平等之间存在很大差距，这与旧的传统习惯和社会偏见是紧密相关的。在发展中国家，男尊女卑的思想还有相当的市场，严峻的经济状况又大大阻碍了妇女地位的改善。所以，要把《公约》的规定变成现实，还需要国际社会和各国妇女进行长期的斗争。
