Philippine government forces and rebel troops continue to clash.

	Ramos says government forces' current mission is to completely
	eliminate the rebel troops

	Xinhua News Agency, Manila, December 2

	2000 troops sent by the Philippine government from Southern Luzon arrived in the streets of Manila this morning, further strengthening the government forces' ability to quell the rebellion.

	Since the rebellion broke out early yesterday morning, the number of reinforcements sent by the Philippine government from the south and north of Manila has increased to 8,000.

	In a press conference held this morning at the headquarters of the Philippine Armed Forces, Defense Secretary Ramos said that the government forces have gained the upper hand in the battle against the rebel troops, and the rebels will not be able to stage a comeback. The current mission of the government forces is to "completely eliminate" the rebel troops.

	Reports indicate that the rebel troops have withdrawn from the government television station's Channel 4 building and some of the rebel troops who attacked the headquarters of the Philippine Armed Forces at Camp Aguinaldo have surrendered to the government forces.

	However, Ramos admitted that the rebel troops still control some areas in the streets of Manila, including the headquarters of the Army Command at Camp Bonifacio. This morning, the gunfight between the government forces and the rebel troops continues.

	He said that the government forces will end the battle by noon today and stated that the government will not forgive those who participated in this rebellion.

	After the rebellion in the Philippines, some government leaders from other countries condemned the rebellion and expressed support for the Corazon Aquino government. U.S. officials expressed support for the Philippine government in suppressing the rebellion and said that if the Philippine government is overthrown, the U.S. will stop all aid to the Philippines. Meanwhile, at the invitation of Corazon Aquino, U.S. military forces stationed at the U.S. military base in the Philippines dispatched supersonic jet fighters to cover the Philippine government forces' ground troops in their counterattack against the rebel troops.

	The European Community issued a statement on December 1, stating that the European Community supports the current government elected by the people of the Philippines and supports the democratic process led by the Philippine government. The statement also condemned all illegal violent actions against the government.

	French President Mitterrand also sent a telegram to President Corazon Aquino reaffirming France's support for the Philippine government. He said that France will always stand with the people of the Philippines.

	The ASEAN partners of the Philippines, including Thailand, Singapore, as well as New Zealand and Canada, have all expressed support for the Corazon Aquino government.

	Since the rebellion broke out, President Corazon Aquino has repeatedly urged the people to be vigilant and once again demonstrated the "power of the people" to support her government.

	So far, 21 people have been killed and 42 injured in the clashes between the government forces and the rebel troops.

    菲政府军与政变军继续交战
    拉莫斯说政府军目前任务是彻底围剿政变军
    新华社马尼拉12月2日电  菲律宾政府从南吕宋岛调集的2000名援军今晨到达马尼拉市区，进一步加强了政府军平息政变的能力。
    自昨天凌晨政变发生以来菲政府从马尼拉的南北两个方向调动的援军增加到了8000名。
    菲国防部长拉莫斯今晨在菲武装部队司令部举行的记者招待会上说，政府军在反击政变军的战斗中已经占了上风，政变军已不可能卷土重来，政府军目前的任务是“彻底围剿”政变军。
    有消息说，政变军已撤离他们占领的官方电视台第4频道所在大楼，并有一些参加攻打阿吉纳尔多军营的菲武装部队司令部所在地政变军已向政府军投降。
    但拉莫斯承认政变军目前仍控制着马尼拉市区的一些地方，其中包括陆军司令部所在地博尼法西奥军营。今晨，政府军和政变军之间的枪战仍在继续。
    他表示政府军将在今天中午之前结束战斗，并说政府对参加这次政变的人“决不会宽恕”。
    菲政变发生后，一些国家政府领导人谴责政变并表示支持科·阿基诺政府。美国官员表示支持菲政府平息叛乱，并说，如果菲政府被推翻的话，美将停止对菲的一切援助。同时，应科·阿基诺之邀，美驻菲军事基地的美军出动超音速喷气式战斗机掩护菲政府军地面部队对政变军发起反击。
    欧洲共同体12月1日发表一项公报指出，欧共体支持由菲律宾人民选出的现政府，并支持由菲政府领导进行的民主进程。公报还谴责了所有非法反对政府的暴力行动。
    法国总统密特朗也致电科·阿基诺总统重申法国支持菲律宾政府的立场。他说，法国永远站在菲律宾人民一边。
    菲律宾的东盟伙伴泰国、新加坡以及新西兰、加拿大等国政府都表示支持科·阿基诺的政府。
    自政变发生以来，科·阿基诺总统一再吁请人民提高警惕，并再一次显示出“人民力量”来支持她的政府。
    到目前为止，在政府军与政变军的交战中已有21人死亡，42人受伤。
