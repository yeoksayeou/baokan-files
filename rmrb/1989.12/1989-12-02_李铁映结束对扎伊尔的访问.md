Li Tieying, a member of the State Council and Minister of the State Education Commission, led a Chinese government delegation to conclude a five-day official friendly visit to Zaire today and returned to China.

Li Tieying told the press before his departure that the visit of the Chinese government delegation to Zaire was a complete success. This friendly visit deepened the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Zairean peoples and strengthened the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries. He hoped that the friendship between China and Zaire would be passed down from generation to generation.

During the visit, Li Tieying was received by Zairean President Mobutu. Li Tieying also held talks with Zairean First Vice-President Nguza and other party and government leaders on strengthening friendly cooperative relations between the two countries and issues of common concern.

Before visiting Zaire, Li Tieying had visited Chad, the Central African Republic, and Congo.
