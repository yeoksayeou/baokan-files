The towering figure stood motionless atop the hill of Snake Mouth Battery, his gaze fixed on the distant, leaden waters of Lingdingyang, much as he had once watched the burning opium in the waters of Huangpu. The wind blew in from the distant ocean, rustling the battle robes on his statue. Wave after wave surged towards his feet, as if questioning and challenging something—“splash…boom…splash…boom…” They rose up, their leaden bodies crashing against the jagged rocks in a tragic sacrifice, spraying a mist of white foam before merging back into the sea, ready to nurture new waves of turmoil and roar. Lin Zexu’s statue stood facing the relentless waves of Lingdingyang, as if deep in historical contemplation. He refused to look back at the decaying dynasty, standing with his back turned.

A century had passed.

Behind this national hero, the overgrown fields were transforming into a beautiful mirage, reflecting the continental shelf of the South China Sea.

No, it was not a mirage, but a real city named Shenzhen.

This city was just nine years old.

A nine-year-old child is full of innocence, but a nine-year-old city is like an adult.

Ten years ago, this place was a small town of just three square kilometers, where 30,000 Chinese people lived simple, agrarian lives.

At that time, the town didn’t even have a single public bus. Hong Kong and Macau residents visiting relatives in the mainland would cross the Luohu Bridge, hire a bicycle, and sit on the back carrier, listening to the labored breathing of the cyclist as they bumped along the rough roads. How many people had looked across the river at Hong Kong, yearning for the “paradise” built on capital, and attempted to sneak across the border, only to meet their end in the mud?

The rise of this new city was something Lin Zexu, who had devoted his life to defending against foreign invaders, could never have imagined. As the 20th century began, the Chinese Communist Party and government made a decision to open this area to the world, establishing the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

Overseas Chinese and foreigners brought capital to this land. By 1988, the city had 2,200 joint-venture enterprises; utilized $2.1 billion in foreign investment; and the industrial output value of these enterprises reached 5.432 billion yuan, accounting for 61.17% of the city’s total industrial output. In 1988 alone, the city earned $1.85 billion in foreign exchange, second only to Shanghai nationwide. This young city, vibrant with the energy of openness, gained fame both domestically and internationally.

Profit is the best guide. Hong Kong girls began to marry into Shenzhen, a testament to the city’s allure. Those who once went to Dazhai and Hutu Mountain for guidance now flocked south to observe the “Shenzhen Model.”

The skyscrapers rising from the ground, the dizzying production lines, the vibrant nightclubs, the supermarkets filled with goods, the beautiful Xianhu and Xili Lake resorts… the prosperity, the splendor, the noise, the strangeness—all of it stirred up waves of shock in the hearts of the Chinese people.

However, with the prosperity of the special economic zone came a new challenge for the Communist Party members of Shenzhen. Alongside openness came some decay, quietly eroding the party and government’s body, presenting a battle without gunpowder smoke…

Sandao’ao, known as the special zone within the special zone. A 200-meter-long “Middle-English Street” coexisted with two different social systems. Some joked: “Take one step and you’re in capitalism.”

This place had the most gold shops. The gleam of various gold ornaments formed the backdrop of “Middle-English Street.”

A Communist Party member named Lin Cheng was lured by the golden dream. He dressed himself as a “pioneer,” taking on the role of manager at the Zhanye Commercial Building. His store sold gold ornaments, and now he could face this golden thing directly, gaining his dream from it. He treated the “manager responsibility system” as a “patriarchal system.” Since he was the patriarch, he could arbitrarily control everything here.

He first secretly raised the prices of gold products, pocketing the difference, making a small fortune.

The benefits from the golden angel made him forget the high moral standards of his predecessors in the hard times, who would eat a sweet potato and leave a silver dollar for the people. He even forged payrolls, directly embezzling the residual value of discarded goods and commission fees. In just two years, he embezzled 2.5 million yuan! He stored these ill-gotten gains in several banks, encoding 86 passwords!

In the same time and space, another Communist Party member also wove a golden dream. His name was Zhou Songrui, a technical staff member at the Xili Lake Resort construction site. This shrewd man from the mainland, familiar with certain flaws in the current cadre system, won the praise and trust of his superiors with his “obedient,” “sincere,” and “capable” demeanor. He even lived and worked with the workers on the construction site, quickly gaining the management rights of Xili Lake’s infrastructure from his superiors.

Immediately, he became the “unofficial emperor” in the minds of many contractors. Initially, contractors, eager for projects, would offer him hand grenades (alcohol); twenty rounds (cigarettes); explosive packages (snacks). Later, it became “good cigarettes and alcohol are outdated, squid and shrimp are tasteless, color TVs and refrigerators are okay, but gold and foreign currency are the best.” The more one bribed, the more Zhou Songrui would favor them.

In 1984, Xili Lake needed neon lights. Zhou Songrui handed the project to a certain Hong Kong businessman, saying, “We’ll sign the contract after the project is inspected.” The Hong Kong businessman understood the implication and, before the trial run, slipped $20,000 in “gratitude money” into Zhou Songrui’s pocket, an amount nearly equal to one-tenth of the project’s cost.

This was truly a crime under the neon lights.

While the pioneers sweated on the high scaffolding, Zhou Songrui, in the four years he oversaw the infrastructure, accepted bribes 87 times, totaling 928,000 yuan and 126,000 Hong Kong dollars. When the procuratorate detained and interrogated him, his pocket still held a “Notice of a Seminar for Contributing Technical Personnel.”

The “pioneer bull” lowered its head, its four hooves plowing vigorously under the blue sky. This was a statue in front of the Municipal Committee office building. This statue embodied the spirit of tens of thousands of Shenzhen pioneers. Officials coming to work in the building had to pass by it before sitting around the long conference table. Their agenda was not just about foreign investment, infrastructure planning, enterprise management, urban construction… They also faced reports of triumph from the front lines of the pioneers. They heard the alarm of history echoing over the South China Sea.

The Shenzhen procuratorate investigated and handled 488 economic cases from 1982 to 1986, involving 378 Communist Party members and 353 state cadres.

Southern wind through the southern window. What wind blew into our “heart”?

Shenzhen’s skyscrapers rose, and the assembly lines ran. But the phenomenon of corruption spread like scabies on the young city’s body, the most serious public harm, the most terrifying environmental pollution. Some accepted huge bribes; some participated in smuggling; some exploited the dual-track system to speculate on permits and scarce resources; some illegally traded foreign exchange for huge profits. In foreign economic activities, using power for personal gain and dereliction of duty caused even greater losses to the special zone. Some individuals accepted favors from foreigners, bringing back unusable old equipment; some, after taking bribes, agreed to Hong Kong’s request to modify contracts, causing the state to suffer losses of millions or even tens of millions of yuan with a wave of the hand. Some individuals gained a little meat, but the state lost a thousand pigs!

Shenzhen, this city rising from the wasteland, would it sink in the ocean of desire?

The “dangerous revolutionary” of commodity economy leaped onto the special zone’s consolidated land, filling it with vitality and energy, but also tempting some to throw their power into the circulation field, turning government functional departments into a “market.” Would it really, as Marx said, become a “giant social still” where everything thrown in comes out as a monetary crystal?

Adam Smith compared the market to an “invisible hand,” which tore off the tender veil, simplifying the complex relationships between people into a relationship of interests, an equivalent exchange. Those drawn to it pursued the abstract form of wealth—money. Owning money also became the inner force of life in capitalist society. In the early development of capitalist society, the exchange of power and money by government officials and merchants was the fruit of the money fetishism brought by commodity economy!

Did commodity economy also bring its genetic genes to this land?

On March 28, 1871, the first new proletarian government in human history, the Paris Commune, was established in Paris. The Paris Commune first announced to the world: state administrators are servants of the people.

Before liberation, the New Fourth Army general Peng Shuhuai was buried after his martyrdom, and every household in the local area placed a bowl of clean water and a mirror at their doorstep, commemorating his “clean as water” and “clear as a mirror” life!

What about our “mirror” today?

Reform is the greatest revolutionary act, and Communist Party members and government officials should most thoroughly demonstrate their servant spirit in this revolutionary act!

At the beginning of the special zone’s creation, the pioneers formulated the “Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Economic Development Strategy” and at the same time formulated the “Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Spiritual Civilization Outline,” proposing the special zone spirit of “pioneering, innovating, dedicating, and being clean.”

Now, the people in the building, while revising plans for the reform of the planning system, enterprise system, price system, foreign trade and foreign exchange management system, and government management agencies, also hung up mirrors for the practitioners of these systemic reforms—“Special Zone Cadres’ Code of Conduct,” “Ten Regulations on Improving Party Style,” “Five Measures to Correct the Wind of Using Power for Personal Gain,” “Regulations on Handling Affairs in Sino-foreign Joint Ventures and Foreign Economic Activities”…

The best mirror is history!

The mirror of history silently shows: the rise and fall of the world are many things, self-corruption brings disaster!

Lin Zexu would not forget that three thousand British expeditionary forces, exhausted, landed in Zhejiang, and like a knife through butter, swept through the vast land of China with a billion people, reaching the Forbidden City, forcing the Chinese emperor to sign a humiliating treaty!

In the late days of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, military and political officials used their power to do business, oppressing the people. Chiang Kai-shek sensed the impending doom, sending his son Chiang Ching-kuo to Shanghai, where the bureaucratic capitalists gathered, to “catch tigers.” However, the young Chiang could not shake the stronghold of corrupt officials—the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families, and after catching a few flies, he retreated, sounding the retreat. The Chiang regime finally perished in the mire of corruption.

In the early 1950s, the Communist Party members who had just entered the city maintained a clear mind, constantly vigilant against the occurrence of corruption within themselves. In the “Three Anti” and “Five Anti” campaigns, the party punished Zhang Zishan and Liu Qingshan, who held important positions, deterring a large number of corrupt elements and winning the trust of the people.

Unfortunately, during the so-called “Great Democracy” of the Cultural Revolution, with the rampage of power hunger, corruption within the party and society began to spread, and the collision of power hunger and corruption almost pushed the national economy to the brink of collapse!

Shenzhen is a new city built on the beach. And the people who came to build this city could not all be new people. They brought historical accumulation and tradition.

If we do not grasp the construction of clean government at the same time as reform, we may make the reform and opening up go astray, and we may turn the special zone with towering buildings into a spiritual Yuanmingyuan!

The wind of clean government rises in Pengcheng.

Punishing corruption, no matter how powerful or how meritorious! Can it be done?

For those who have deviated from the servant principle, they hold a mirror of power in their hands, enlarging their own image on one side and shrinking the people on the other side. They overestimate themselves because they overestimate power.

The Shenzhen Municipal Committee cracked down on a major case—the case of He Min, the former member of the Municipal Committee and head of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, who accepted and extorted bribes.

This was an operation on the “heart” of the special zone.

He Min could also be considered an “old revolutionary” who had “eaten coarse grains, carried a gun, and been wounded.” Perhaps when he slept in the long worker’s house, he did not expect to become an important party and government official and law enforcer in China’s first economic special zone.

The special environment of the special zone triggered his special understanding of the power in his hands. Perhaps he regarded joining the party and participating in the revolution as an investment, a share. In the face of the prosperous special zone economy, it was time for him to collect dividends.

He made his first power transaction: under the pretext of “increasing social income,” he approved Huang XX of the Futan Commune in the suburbs to handle the “sea-going certificate” and the “entry and exit permit for Hong Kong and Macau,” allowing Huang XX to exceptionally enter and exit Hong Kong and Kowloon from the non-opening port of Huanggang.

He Min’s special treatment made Huang XX quickly become rich. He Min then let his son He Nanfang go to Huang XX to extort, and Huang XX bought a used “Mercedes-Benz” to give him. He Min quickly sold this car to the mainland—auctioning the power given by the people on the market!

The risk-free transaction made He Min taste the sweetness, and soon he approved the “exit permit” and “household registration transfer certificate” for the father of Chen XX, the boss of the Hong Kong Golden Eagle Car Company, and “naturally” received a “Big White Sand” car from the Hong Kong boss.

Later, this exchange of power and money developed to the point of open pricing, “money for goods.” A farmer from Longgang District applied for an exit permit but was not approved. Introduced by someone, he found He Min’s in-law Lin Cheng. Lin Cheng said, “To sail, you need water.” The two agreed on the spot with a price of 200,000 Hong Kong dollars, and this in-law let his son-in-law He Nanfang handle the exit permit through He Min. Lin Cheng took the certificate to the farmer’s house: “You give the money, and I’ll give you the certificate.”

He Min used feudal clan relationships to form a vast network, spreading this net and using power to grab money. Father and son, husband and wife, in-laws, the crimes escalated. When relevant departments began to investigate his in-laws for smuggling and hooliganism, this in-law brazenly shouted, “Who dares to touch a hair on my body?” And He Min’s son had the tone of a “prince of the realm”: “You arrest me at the front door, and you have to release me at the back door!”

He Min, who had already taken up the position of deputy director of the Provincial Reform-through-Labor Bureau, heard that the Shenzhen Municipal Committee was investigating his problems and lost his mind, shouting in front of the provincial leaders, “I will fight to the death with the Shenzhen Municipal Committee!” He really returned to Shenzhen with a gun, threatening and pressuring the relevant leaders of the Municipal Committee with a “returning in glory” threat, going from door to door.

The procurators and disciplinary inspection commission members of Shenzhen did not yield to his power intimidation and temptation. They spent two years writing millions of words of case files, investigating and clarifying He Min’s extortion case. He Min shouted “innocent” as he entered prison, but what thoughts did he leave behind?

In the process of modernizing the special zone, seeking the unity of people’s interests and the internal perfection of people and morality, seeking a reasonable balance between material civilization and spiritual civilization, has become an unavoidable historical mission for the pioneers of the special zone.

On December 2, 1986, the National People’s Congress discussed and decided to restore the supervisory system, and on August 15, 1987, the state established the Supervisory Bureau.

The pioneers of Shenzhen, based on the characteristics of the special zone, took a step ahead—on November 9, 1985, the Shenzhen Municipal Government Office Meeting made a resolution to establish the “Municipal Government Supervisory Bureau.” On May 7, 1987, the first “Administrative Supervisory Bureau” sign was hung on the land of the Republic, becoming the supervisory body for 53,700 public servants. It would implement supervision over state organs and their personnel, state-owned enterprises and administrative cadres, and Chinese representatives and dispatched personnel in Sino-foreign joint ventures.

This was the special zone’s “Clean Government Bureau.”

Across the water from Shenzhen, Hong Kong, in the late 1960s, as commodity economy developed, corruption became serious. The Governor of Hong Kong established the “Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption” in the crisis, launching a “clean government storm” in Hong Kong.

How would the work of our Administrative Supervisory Bureau begin?

The Municipal Government set a six-character policy for the Administrative Supervisory Bureau: “Legislation, Education, Case Handling.” Mayor Li Ha added a sentence: “Starting with the supervision of the mayor of our city!”

She was not a “juvenile delinquent,” but the company she worked for produced the hit film “Juvenile Delinquent.” As the deputy general manager of this film company, she used the opportunity to cooperate with Hong Kong businessmen to embezzle 11.5 million yuan and 30 million Hong Kong dollars, providing Hong Kong businessmen with long-term use, which was “giving peaches.” This made the Hong Kong businessmen gain huge profits, and the state suffered huge losses. Later, she accepted 100 million Hong Kong dollars of investment capital, 20% of the shares from the Hong Kong businessmen, which was “returning with plums,” making her secretly become a director and shareholder of a certain Hong Kong company, and also making her become a “middle-aged criminal”!

She was very arrogant. Even during the period when she was ordered to stop work and undergo inspection, she still used her relationship with Hong Kong businessmen to handle “studying abroad” for her daughter and future daughter-in-law, letting the Hong Kong businessmen provide tuition and living expenses totaling 94,000 Hong Kong dollars.

This was the first case handled by the Supervisory Bureau after its establishment.

Intercessors came one after another.

Facing the interference of power and relationships, the “three letters” were born—“Letter of Thanks for Consideration.” During the investigation and trial, no matter who interceded or sent notes, the Administrative Supervisory Bureau would issue this letter, equivalent to a yellow card warning, and the intercessor would also be recorded. There were also “Notice of Assistance in Case Handling” and “Supervisory Suggestions.” The small “three letters” were the “sword of authority” given by the Municipal Government to the Administrative Supervisory Bureau.

In early 1988, Shenzhen established the “Municipal Supervisory Work Consultative Committee.”

This was a “legislative consultative body” composed of party and government organs, judicial departments, enterprise leaders, people’s representatives, legal workers, social celebrities, news agencies, social organizations, democratic parties, and retired cadres. They participated in the discussion and revision of some regulations and systems, providing advice for clean government construction, and concentrating the social clean government consciousness on the implementation of supervisory laws and regulations.

They also built the first “Economic Crime Reporting Center” in the country and established the “Mayor’s Hotline” relatively early. At the same time, they insisted on the joint meeting system of the disciplinary inspection commission, procuratorate, court, public security, audit, taxation, industry and commerce, and supervision, with various functional departments closely cooperating, using legal, administrative, systemic, disciplinary, and educational means, “five-pronged approach,” to launch a clean government wind.

The Administrative Supervisory Bureau, starting from the investigation of the case of the deputy general manager of Shenzhen Film Company Zheng XX, had handled 176 economic cases by the time of the interview. Among them, 34 were major cases, and 58 people had received administrative penalties, including 6 bureau-level and division-level cadres and 15 section-level cadres. They had recovered economic losses for the state totaling 2.206 million yuan, $826,100, and 1.222 million Hong Kong dollars.

In just 1989, they held six anti-corruption and lenient sentencing meetings across the city, deterring criminals.

More importantly, through systemic and institutional reforms, they sought to eliminate the breeding ground for corruption.

I very much agree with the mayor’s words: power must be subject to the supervision of the people. A government without supervision will become corrupt.

They were seeking.

They tried the system of publicizing the income of party and government leaders, with standing committee members, mayors, and deputy mayors reporting their financial sources to the Administrative Supervisory Bureau every month. They periodically publicized the use of cars, fuel, and telephone fees.

They were changing the secretive and closed working methods in personnel work, implementing open administration and management. The procedures for government affairs were open, and the promotion and appointment of cadres were open to the public.

They also tried the democratic evaluation of cadres, allowing the people to elect their trusted “servants” through legal procedures.

Crime and glory coexisted on the land of the special zone.

The true pioneers, with their righteousness, alleviated the pain of historical progress.

As a member of the Municipal Committee, Shu Chengyou was different from He Min.

Shu Chengyou was the former deputy secretary of the Municipal Government, a “Type 38,” who had participated in more than a hundred large and small battles in the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and the Korean War, and had been seriously wounded three times, twice receiving the title of “Battle Hero.”

He was given a “fat assignment,” overseeing the second-line project with an investment of 1.35 billion yuan. The head of the construction team came to him with thick gifts, asking for work, but he politely said, “All projects go through bidding. Take the gifts back!” He set three rules for himself: do not easily attend banquets, do not accept gifts, and do not use power for personal gain.

The government must be clean, starting from every cadre, and a person must be clean, starting from every small matter.

Relatives from his hometown, knowing that Shu Chengyou was a big official in Shenzhen, came with affection, asking him to find jobs and household registration for their children. Shu Chengyou said, “The special zone does need people, but it needs talent. I cannot violate the regulations.”

A Hong Kong businessman found out that Shu Chengyou was his fellow countryman from Huanggang, Hubei, and came to his door, saying, “Your several children are all working at the grassroots level, why not send one or two to study abroad or settle down, I’ll take care of everything!” Shu Chengyou smiled slightly, “The children’s affairs are mainly up to them to stand on their own feet, I cannot use power for personal gain. As for your investment in Shenzhen, we will handle it according to the policy, you can rest assured.”

Shu Chengyou lived and worked with workers and technicians on the construction site, and when the cook sometimes made a stir-fry for him, he also refused this small favor, pouring the dish into the big pot for everyone to share.

Money can make a person rich, but it cannot make a person full; money can buy happiness, but it cannot buy inner peace. In the choice between money and dignity, many people in Shenzhen rejected the former—since the launch of clean government education, the city had a total of 3,914 people (times) refusing gifts and bribes, amounting to 838,000 yuan and 509,000 Hong Kong dollars.

The young customs officers at the Luohu Port searched a large amount of foreign currency from a illegal Hong Kong customer’s specially made bag and leg bindings—290,000 Hong Kong dollars, $25,000, and 27,000 Singapore dollars, which he was preparing to carry out of the country. When only the customs officer Shen Yujian was left in the room, the Hong Kong customer whispered, “Let me go, I’ll give you 50,000 Hong Kong dollars!” The young Chinese customs officer replied, “Even if you’re full of money, you can’t buy me!”

A friend gave me a copy of “Shenzhen Youth,” which had a “Social Survey Mailbox” column:

Your opinion on Shenzhen is—1. A beautiful city; 2. A modern city; 3. A city where talents can be displayed; 4. An efficient city; 5. A city where one can make money; 6. A corrupt city. The friend tentatively asked me, “What will you fill in?” I said, “Let me think about it…”

Confused? Yes, because every time I come to Shenzhen, I hear news of various economic crimes…

Li Haidong, the director of the Shenzhen Supervisory Bureau, told me, “Many cases being exposed actually prove our strength! From the outside, it seems that Shenzhen has many cases, as if Shenzhen is terrible, but this does not reflect the facts. To some extent, corruption is a byproduct of a society transitioning from closed to open, from underdeveloped to developed. But we cannot tolerate or indulge it, we must fight a protracted war! And through reform, solve the new problems that arise in the reform!”

I climbed Snake Mouth Battery Hill, looking at the distant, leaden waters of Lingdingyang, and also looking back at the Shenzhen Bay in front of me. Behind Lin Zexu, the Yantian Port, jointly built with foreigners, was under construction. It would be one of China’s four major deep-water ports, with three giant wharves of three million, five million, and ten million tons, connecting the five continents. The three-billion-dollar color TV building, jointly built with Japan, also had a prospect, and soon the world’s first-class color TVs would be produced on its assembly line and sold to various countries. The new Huanggang Port would soon be completed, and then 50,000 vehicles could pass through it every day. There was also the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, introduced from France, the international airport, the expressway, and the ethylene project with an investment of more than 20 billion dollars… By 1990, Shenzhen’s GDP would reach 7 billion yuan, with a per capita income of 5,800 yuan, completing the “second step” ten years ahead of the national average. By the year 2000, Shenzhen would be among the first to achieve the goals of the second and third steps of China’s economic development strategy, be among the first to build a major foreign exchange earning base for China’s foreign trade, and be among the first to build a region operating according to international practices.

I heard the mechanical rammer on the construction site vigorously pounding the continental shelf of South China. That was the will of the people building the foundation stones of the new century!

Boom… splash… boom… splash… the tides of Lingdingyang rose unceasingly!

    潮涨伶仃洋
    李延国
    1
    他那巨大的身躯站在灌木丛生的蛇口炮台山上，一动也不动，双目凝视着远处铅灰色的伶仃洋，就像当年在虎门注视着熊熊焚烧的鸦片烟。风从遥远的大洋彼岸吹来，他身上的战袍似乎在猎猎作响。一排又一排海浪鼓荡着奔向他的脚下，仿佛在叩问着什么冲决着什么——“哗……嘭……哗……嘭……”它们昂起铅灰色的身躯，在那狰狞的礁石上悲壮地献身，迸溅起一片乳白色的血浆，而后汇流进海的怀抱，去孕育新的激荡和咆哮。林则徐的雕像就这样面对着前赴后继的伶仃洋潮涌，似乎在做历史的沉思。他不愿再回头看一眼那个腐败的王朝，就一直这样背转着身子。
    毕竟一个世纪过去了。
    在这位民族英雄的身后，那荒草丛生的滩野上，正悄悄幻化出一片美丽的海市蜃楼，辉映着南中国海大陆架。
    不，那不是海市蜃楼，而是一座实实在在的城市，它的名字叫深圳。
    2
    这个城市刚刚九岁。
    一个九岁的儿童正天真烂漫，而一个九岁的城市却像一个成人。
    十年前，这里还是一个面积只有三平方公里的小镇，三万个炎黄子孙在这里过着“男耕女织”的田园生活。
    那时候小镇上甚至还没有一辆公共汽车，回内地探亲的港澳同胞跨过罗湖桥之后，雇上一辆自行车，坐在后架上，听着蹬车人呼哧呼哧的气喘声，在崎岖的小路上颠簸着前进。有多少人曾望着一河之隔的香港，向往着那个用资本堆积起来的“天堂”，越境偷渡，葬身泥沼。
    这座新城的崛起，是一心抵御外寇的林则徐决没有想到的。一进入公元20世纪80年代，中国党和政府便作出决策，把这里作为对外开放的一个窗口，建立起深圳经济特区。
    洋人和侨胞带着资本踏上了这片土地，到1988年，全市已有“三资”企业2200家；利用外资21亿美元；“三资”企业的工业产值已达54．32亿元，占全市工业总产值的61.17％。仅1988年一年，全市创外汇18.5亿美元，在全国仅次于上海，居第二位。这个年轻的城市因开放而生气勃勃，在国内外享有盛名。
    利益是最好的向导。这里有了香港姑娘回嫁深圳的佳话。以前去大寨虎头山取经的人们也纷纷掉头南下，来参观一下“深圳模式”。
    那一座座拔地而起的巨厦，那令人目眩的生产流水线，那色彩斑烂的歌舞厅，那商品极其丰富的超级市场，那美丽的香蜜湖和西丽湖渡假村……那繁荣、那绮丽、那喧嚣、那怪诞，都在国人心里激起了不小的冲击波。
    然而，随着特区经济的繁荣，一个新的课题摆在了深圳共产党人面前，与开放同时带来的一
  些腐朽的东西，开始悄悄浸蚀党和政府的肌体，特区的共产党人正面临着一场没有硝烟的战斗……
    3
    沙头角，被人称为特区的特区。一条二百米长的“中英街”，并存着两种不同的社会制度。有人戏称：一步跨过去就是资本主义。
    这里的金店最多。各种金饰品闪烁出的光晕，构成了“中英街”的底色。
    一位叫林成的共产党人被这金色的梦召唤来了。他把自己打扮成“开拓者”，占据了展业商场经理的职务。他的商场就经营金饰品，现在他可以直接面对着这个黄澄澄的东西，从那里获得那个梦。他把“经理负责制”当成“家长制”，既然是家长，他就可以任意对这里的一切进行支配。
    他首先私自提高黄金制品的价格，把差价款装进了自己的腰包，发了一笔不小的横财。
    从那金色的天使身上获得的好处使他忘记了他的先辈在那艰苦岁月里吃群众一块红薯留下一块银元的高风亮节，他干脆伪造工资表，直接侵吞报废商品残值和代销手续费，短短两年时间，竟贪污公款25万元之巨！他把这些赃款分别存进几家银行，按存款单编了86个密码！
    4
    在同一时空里，另一位共产党人也编织了一个黄金梦。他叫周松瑞，是西丽湖渡假村建筑工地的技术员。这位从内地赶来“创业”的精明人，深谙我们现行干部体制的某些弊端，以“听话”、“诚恳”、“能干”的面目取得了领导的好评和信任。他甚至在建筑工地和工人同吃同住，很快，领导把西丽湖基建的管理权交给了他。
    立时，他成为众多包工头心目中的“无冕皇帝”。最初，包工头为了揽工程，向他投来的是手榴弹（酒）；二十响（烟）；炸药包（点心）。后来则是“好烟好酒已过时，鱿鱼虾米无滋味，彩电冰箱还可以，黄金外币最相宜”。谁行贿多，周松瑞就让谁受益大。
    1984年西丽湖要装霓虹灯，周松瑞把工程交给某港商时说：“等工程验收时再签合同。”港商听出弦外之音，于试灯前将两万港币“酬谢金”塞进了周松瑞的腰包，这个数字接近这宗工程造价的十分之一。
    这真是一桩霓虹灯下的罪恶。
    当创业者们站在高高的脚手架上大把大把甩着汗水的时候，周松瑞在他主持基建的四年间87次受贿，共得赃款合人民币9.28万元，港币12.6万元。在检察院拘留审查他时，他的口袋里还装着一份“有贡献的工程技术人员座谈会通知书”。
    5
    那头“开荒牛”低垂头颅、四蹄奋力地在蓝天下耕耘着。那是市委办公大楼前的一座雕塑。这座雕塑上浇注了几十万深圳创业者的精神风貌。到大楼里来上班的公仆们都要走过它的面前，而后围坐在长长的会议桌前。他们的议题不只是外商投资、基建规划、企业管理、市政建设……摆在他们面前的也不仅是来自第一线开荒牛们的辉煌战报。他们听到了历史的警钟正回荡在南中国海的上空。
    深圳检察机关自1982年至1986年查处各类经济案件488宗，其中涉及共产党员378人，国家干部353人。
    南风窗。南窗风。是什么风吹到了我们的“心脏”里？
    深圳的高楼在崛起，流水线在运转。而腐败现象也像疥癣一样在年轻的城市肌体上蔓延着，这是最严重的公害，是最可怕的环境污染。有人接受巨额贿赂；有人参与走私；有人利用双轨制的差价倒卖批文，倒卖紧俏物资；有人非法炒卖外汇，谋取暴利。而在对外经济活动中以权谋私和渎职罪，给特区造成的损失更大。有的是个人接受了外商的好处，买回了不能使用的陈旧设备；有的是在受贿之后，同意港方修改合同，举手之间就使国家蒙受几百万、上千万元损失。正是个人得到了一两肉，国家损失万头猪！
    深圳，这个从荒滩上崛起的城市，难道会在欲望的海洋中沉沦吗？
    商品经济这个“危险万分的革命家”，惊险地跳跃着登上了特区板结的土地，使它充满了生机和活力，但也诱使一部分人把权力投入流通领域，使政府职能部门也变成了“市场”，难道真的会像马克思所说的那样“流通成了巨大的社会蒸馏器，一切东西抛到里面去，再出来都成为货币的结晶”？
    亚当·斯密把市场比做一只“看不见的手”，正是这只手撕掉了温情脉脉的面纱，把复杂的人与人之间的关系简化成一种利益关系，一个等价交换关系。被它吸引的人们追求着财富的抽象形式——货币。占有金钱也就成了资本主义社会人生的内在力量。在资本主义社会发展的初期，政府官员和商人所进行的权力和金钱的交换，就是商品经济带出来的金钱拜物教所结下的果实！
    难道商品经济也把它的遗传基因带到了这片土地上？

    1871年3月28日，在巴黎建立了人类第一个新型无产阶级政权——巴黎公社。巴黎公社第一次向全人类宣布：国家管理人员是人民的公仆。
    解放前，新四军名将彭雪枫牺牲后安葬的时候，驻地老百姓家家门口都摆着一碗清水和一面镜子，缅怀他“清廉如水”和“明镜高悬”的一生！
    我们今天的“镜子”呢？
    改革是最大的革命行为，共产党人和政府工作人员应该在这种革命行为中最彻底地表现他们的公仆精神！
    特区的创业者们在开创之初制订《深圳特区经济发展战略》的同时，就制订了《深圳特区精神文明大纲》。提出了“开拓、创新、献身、廉洁”的特区精神。
    而今，大楼里的人们在修订计划体制、企业体制、价格体制、外贸外汇管理体制，以及政府管理机构等方面的改革规划的同时，也为进行这些体制改革的实践者们悬起了一面面“镜子”——《特区干部守则》、《关于搞好党风的十条规定》、《关于纠正以权谋私不正之风的五项措施》、《关于在中外合资企业中和在对外经济活动中的规定》……
    最好的镜子是历史！
    历史的镜子在默默地昭示：天下兴亡多少事，自身腐败遭厄运！
    林则徐不会忘记，三千名英国远征军，疲惫不堪地在浙江登陆，竟在有亿万之众的神州大地上势如破竹，直抵清宫，迫使中国的皇帝签订了屈辱的和约！
    当年，接近末日的蒋家王朝军政官员纷纷以权经商，鱼肉百姓，蒋介石预感到即将招致亡身之祸，派出太子蒋经国到官僚资本麇集的上海去“打老虎”。怎奈血气方刚的蒋太子无法动摇贪官污吏的大本营——蒋宋孔陈四大家族，只打了几个苍蝇便鸣金收兵，蒋家王朝终于在腐败的浊气中走向覆灭。
    50年代初，刚进城的共产党人保持着清醒的头脑，时刻警惕着自身腐败现象的发生。在“三反”、“五反”运动中，党对身居要职的张子善和刘青山，绳之以法，震慑了大批腐败分子，博得了人民的信赖。
    可惜，在号称“大民主”的“文革”中，随着权力欲的肆虐，党内和社会上的腐败现象又开始蔓延，权力欲和腐败现象的交叉撞击，几乎把国民经济推到了崩溃的边缘！
    深圳是一座海滩上建设起来的新城。而来建设这座城的人不可能都是全新的人。他们带来了历史的积淀和因袭。
    不在改革的同时抓好廉政建设，就有可能使改革开放走上邪路，就有可能使巨厦擎天的特区变成一座精神上的圆明园！

    廉政风云起鹏城。
    惩治腐败，不管他权力多大！功劳多高！能做到吗？
    对于那些已经背离了公仆原则的人，他们手中拿着一面权力的双面镜，一面把自己的身影放得很高大，一面把群众照得很渺小，他们过分相信自己，是因为过分相信了权力。
    深圳市委抓了一宗大案——原市委常委、政法委员会主任郝敏的受贿索贿案。
    这是向自己“心脏”上的病灶开刀。
    郝敏也算得上一个“吃过糠，扛过枪，负过伤”的老革命。当年他睡长工屋的时候，也许他并未想到自己会成为中国第一个经济特区的党政要人、执法者。
    特区的特殊环境，诱发了他对自己手中权力的特殊理解。也许他把入党、参加革命看成是一种投资、一种入股。在繁荣的特区经济面前，该是他回收红利的时候了。
    他用手中的权力进行了第一笔交易：以“增加社会收入”为幌子，批准郊区福田公社皇岗大队黄××办理下海证和出入港澳通行证，允许黄××破例由非开放口岸皇岗进出港九。
    郝敏的特殊照顾，使黄××很快暴发起来。郝敏便让儿子郝南方登门向黄××索贿，黄××买回一辆旧“奔驰”相赠，郝敏很快便将这辆汽车转卖到内地——在市场上拍卖了人民给予的权力！
    无本万利的交易使郝敏尝到了甜头，不久，他又为香港金庸车行老板陈×的父亲办理了出港证和户口迁移证，又“理所当然”地收下了香港老板赠送的一辆“大白沙”小汽车。
    后来，这种权力与金钱的交换发展到明码标价、“一手交钱，一手交货”的露骨地步。龙岗区一位农民申请出港未获批准，经人介绍找到郝敏的亲家林城，林城说：“要行船，没有水不行。”双方当场以两万元港币的价格拍板成交，这位亲家让女婿郝南方通过郝敏办妥了出港证，林城拿着证件登上这位农民的家：“你拿出钱来就可以给你证了。”
    郝敏利用封建宗法裙带关系结成了一个庞大的关系网，他撒开这张网，拚命用权力去攫取金钱。父子作案、夫妻作案、亲家作案，愈演愈烈。有关部门开始对他的亲家走私、流氓罪进行调查时，这位亲家公有恃无恐地叫嚣：“谁敢动我一根毫毛？”而郝敏的儿子一副“家天下”的王子口气：“你们前门把我抓进去，后门就得把我放出来！”
    已就任省劳改厅副厅长的郝敏听说深圳市委在查他的问题，竟丧失理智地在省委领导面前大叫：“我要和深圳市委拚了！”他真的带着手枪回到了深圳，一种“衣锦还乡”的威胁，走门串户，给市委有关领导施加压力。
    深圳的检察官和纪委的人们没有在他的权势威吓和诱惑下让步，他们历时两年之久，写下了数百万言的卷宗，查清了郝敏的收贿索贿案。郝敏喊叫着“冤枉”入狱了，可是他留给人们的思考呢？
    在特区现代化进程中，寻求人的利益、追求人和道德完善的内在统一，寻求物质文明与精神文明的合理平衡，已成为特区的创业者们不可推卸的历史使命。

    1986年12月2日，全国人大讨论决定恢复监察体制，1987年8月15日，国家成立了监察部。
    深圳的创业者根据特区的发展特点先行了一步——1985年11月9日深圳市长办公会议上作出了成立“市政府监察局”的决议。1987年5月7日，共和国大地上挂出了第一块“行政监察局”的办公牌子，它成为深圳五万三千七百名公仆的监督机构。它将实施对国家机关及其工作人员、国营企事业单位及行政干部、中外合资企业的中方代表及派出工作人员的监督。
    这是特区的“廉政公署”。
    与深圳一水之隔的香港，在六十年代末随着商品经济的发展，腐败现象严重。香港总督在危机中成立了“香港廉政公署”，在香港掀起了一场“廉政风暴”。
    我们的行政监察局工作从何入手？
    市政府为行政监察局确定了六字方针：“立法、教育、办案。”李灏市长补了一句：“从对我市长的监督开始！”

    她不是“少年犯”，她所在的公司制作过《少年犯》这样叫座的影片，而她做为这家影业公司的副总经理，利用和港商合作之机，先后挪用115万元人民币和300万元港币，提供港商长期使用，这叫“投之以桃”，使港商获得厚利，国家蒙受巨大损失。而后，她从港商那里接受了100万港元投资资本的20％股份，这是港商的“报之以李”，使她暗中成为香港某公司的董事和股东，同时也使她成为一个“中年犯”！
    她气焰极盛。就在被责令停职检查期间，还利用同港商的关系，为其女儿及未婚女婿办理“出国留学”，让港商提供学费、生活费等9.4万港元。
    这是监察局成立后查办的第一个案件。
    说情者接踵而至。
    面对着权力与关系网的干扰，“三书”出世了——“承蒙关照书”。立案、侦察中，不论谁说情、递条子，行政监察局便发出此书，等于黄牌警告，说情人也将录以备案。还有“协助办案通知书”、“监察建议书”。小小“三书”，是市政府交给行政监察局的“尚方宝剑”。
    10
    1988年初，深圳又成立了“市监察工作咨询委员会”。
    这是一个“立法咨询机构”。由党政机关、政法部门、企业领导、人大代表、法律工作者、社会知名人士、新闻单位、社会团体、民主党派和离退休干部组成。他们参与讨论、修订一些法规、制度，为廉政建设出谋划策，把社会的廉政意识凝聚到执行监察法规、条例上。
    他们还建起了全国第一个“经济罪案举报中心”，较早地建立了“市长专线电话”。同时坚持纪检、检察院、法院、公安、审计、税务、工商、监察联席会议制度，各职能部门紧密配合，运用法律的、行政的、制度的、纪律的、教育的手段，“五管齐下”，掀起廉政之风。
    行政监察局从成立后查处深圳影业公司副总经理郑××一案开始，到笔者去采访时已经查处经济案件176宗。其中大案要案34宗，已受到行政处分的58人，其中局处级干部6人，科级干部15人。为国家挽回经济损失人民币220.6万元，美元82.61万元，港币122.2万元。
    仅在1989年一年间，他们先后六次在全市召开了惩治腐败、宽严宣判大会，震慑了犯罪分子。

    更重要的是通过体制和制度的改革去消除滋生腐败现象的温床。
    我很赞赏那位市长的话：权力必须接受人民的监督。没有监督的政府要走向腐败。
    他们在求索。
    他们试行了党政领导干部收入公开制度，常委、市长、副市长按月向行政监察局申报自己的资金来源。定期公布用车、用油、电话费等情况。
    他们正在改变人事工作中神秘化和封闭式的工作方式，实行公开办事，公开管理。机关办事程序公开，提拔、任用干部对群众公开。
    他们还试行民主考评干部制度，让群众依法律程序选举自己信赖的“公仆”。
    12
    罪恶与光荣同时对峙在特区的土地上。
    真正的开荒牛们用自己的一身正气减轻着历史演进带来的阵痛。
    同是市委常委，舒成友就不同于那个郝敏。
    舒成友是原市政府副秘书长，“三八式”，参加过抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝的上百次大小战斗，三次身负重伤，两次荣获“战斗英雄”称号。
    他摊上一个“肥差”，他分工主管投资额达1.35亿元的二线工程。施工队的负责人提着厚礼来找他要活干，他婉言说：“一切工程都通过招标，东西拿回去吧！”
    他给自己约法三章：不轻易赴宴，不收受礼品，不以权谋私。
    政府要廉洁，必须从每一个干部开始，一个人要廉洁，必须从每一件小事开始。
    老家的三亲六故得知舒成友在深圳当大官，带着亲情来找，要求给孩子找工作，落户口，舒成友说：“特区的确需要人，但要的是人才。我不能违反规定。”
    一位港商打听到舒成友是他湖北黄冈老乡，上门说：“你几个子女都在基层打工，不如送一、两个出国留学或定居，一切包在我身上好了！”舒成友微微一笑：“孩子们的事，主要靠他们自立自强，我不能以权谋私。至于你来深圳投资，我们会按政策给你办，尽管放心好了。”
    舒成友在工地上与工人、技术员同吃同住，炊事员有时给他来个小炒，这样一点照顾他也拒绝了，把菜倒进大锅里，大家同享。
    金钱可以使人富有，但并不能使人充实；金钱可以买到欢乐，但无法买到内心的宁静。在金钱与尊严的选择上，许多深圳人摈弃了前者——自开展廉政教育以来，全市拒礼拒贿共有3914人（次），金额达人民币83.8万元，港币50.9万元。
    罗湖口岸的年轻关员们从一不法港客身上特制的布袋和绑腿上搜出了巨额外币——港币29万元，美金25000元，新加坡币27000元，那是他准备携带出境的。当屋内只剩下关员沈玉江一人时，那港客悄声说：“放了我吧，我给你五万港币！”中国的年轻关员回答：“你一身是钱也买不了我！”

    朋友送给我一册《深圳青年》，其中有“社会调查信箱”一栏：
    你对深圳的看法是——1、美丽的城市；2、现代化的城市；3、可施展才能的城市；4、高效率的城市；5、可发财的城市；6、腐化的城市；朋友试探地问我：“你填什么？”我说：“你让我好好地想一想……”
    14
    困惑吗？有的。因为我每一次到深圳来，都会听到各种经济犯罪案的新消息……
    深圳市监察局长李海东对我说：“许多案件的揭露，恰恰证明了我们的力量！外面看深圳的案子多，就好像深圳糟透了，这不符合事实。从某种意义上说，腐败现象是一个社会由封闭走向开放、由不发达走向发达过程中的伴生物，但我们不能因此就姑息容忍，我们必须打持久战！并且通过改革去解决改革中出现的新问题！”

    我登上蛇口炮台山，望着远处铅灰色的伶仃洋，也回望着近前的深圳湾。在林则徐身后，中外合资的砚田港正在兴建，它将是中国四大深水港之一，设三万吨、五万吨、十万吨三个巨型码头，连结起五大洲；同日本合资的三亿美元投资的彩电大楼也有眉目，不久在它的流水线上将生产出世界第一流的彩色电视机，销往各国；皇岗新口岸即将建成，到那时，每天可以有五万台车辆通行。还有从法国引进设备的大亚湾核电站、国际机场、高速公路、20多亿美元投资的乙烯工程……到1990年，深圳的国民总产值将达到70亿元，人均5800元，比全国提前十年走完“第二步”。到2000年，深圳将率先成为实现我国经济发展战略的第二步、第三步奋斗目标的地区之一，率先建设成为我国发展对外贸易的主要创汇基地之一，率先成为建立按国际惯例运作的新体制地区之一。
    我听到基建工地的机械夯正在猛力地敲击着南中国海的大陆架。那是人民的意志在构建新世纪的基石！
    嘭……哗……嘭……哗……伶仃洋潮涨不止！
