The popular and accessible art of clapper opera, after nearly a century of "artistic career," how can it further keep up with the new aesthetic requirements of today's era? This eternal theme of artistic creation is providing many clapper opera writers and artists with ample opportunities for exploration. The recent creation and performance of the modern clapper opera "Village Willow" by the Tianjin Clapper Opera Theater is a rare answer.

"Village Willow" breaks away from the traditional clapper opera's simple depiction of male-female love in the style of talented scholars and beautiful women. It not only describes pure love but also writes about the social and class nature of love. The rural youth Yang Qiuju and Liu Chenglin fall deeply in love, but the lingering and stubborn feudal ideology ruthlessly restrains and torments these two loving hearts from the outside and even from within. By some strange twist of fate, the lovers' relationship is cruelly forged into an "aunt-nephew" relationship. Historical, social, and class factors here show their boundless "authority." The play, with such depth of thought, vividly depicts how feudal theocracy, clan authority, and marital authority tear apart the veil of warmth and affection between people, arousing the audience's strong desire to renew society and update their thinking.

The character portrayal in "Village Willow" is also not ordinary. Qiuju is forced to leave her beloved Liu Chenglin and marry Liu Gen, whom she does not love. But when she learns of Liu Gen's misfortune of being afflicted with illness, she does not despise him but instead feels more sympathy for him; Liu Gen, who has been bedridden for a long time, knows that he should not delay Qiuju, but when he knows that Qiuju has someone in her heart, he cannot suppress his own "dignity" as a husband; that Liu Chenglin, who is forced to painfully call his beloved "aunt," is in a whirlpool of extreme helplessness, cruelly twisting his own soul in a state of love that cannot be loved and hate that cannot be hated. The play unfolds in such a complex web of character traits and psychological changes, with twists and turns. Especially in the "toast" scene, the creators push the conflicts between the three characters to the peak with their powerful writing, and then with a twist, they vividly portray the three good hearts struggling in feudal shackles.

What is even more remarkable is a cast of actors who have both deep traditional foundations and creativity. Ma Shuhua, who plays Qiuju, builds on the art of the Liu (Cuixia) school, combining her own advantages to innovate and create. Whether it is expressing Qiuju's longing for Chenglin or her bitter lamentation of her own misfortune, the long and complex clapper opera tunes she uses are all emotionally rich and vividly express the character's specific mental state at the moment. Especially in the segment before she attempts suicide, the sequence from the reverse beat, scattered beat, reverse melody, clear beat to the great sorrow melody, not only shows the actor's deep artistic accomplishment but also concentrates on showing the actor's skill in mastering traditional techniques to create new characters. Li Xiucun, who plays the Seventh Grandmother, is also very successful. With her rich and generous, freely controlled, and typical "big mouth falling child" style of captivating tunes and rhythm, she vividly portrays a "ugly old woman" who is deeply harmed by feudal etiquette and wants to harm others with feudal etiquette. Especially in the segment where she admonishes her daughter-in-law to keep her chastity before her death, with her singing and acting, she fully satisfies the audience's desire for a good performance and also vividly conveys the terrifying soul of this detestable feudal old woman who is "reluctant to die." It is clear that they have borrowed the modern artistic method of performance from the inside out, making their characters clear and deep, thus convincing and infectious.

    峰回路转  声情并茂
    ——评剧《村南柳》观后
    霍大寿
    通俗易懂、为群众喜闻乐见的评剧艺术，在度过了近百年的“艺术生涯”之后，如何更进一步跟上当今时代的新的审美要求？这个艺术创造的永恒课题，正在为许多评剧作家与艺术家的开拓提供尽情驰骋的可能性。天津评剧院新近创作与演出的评剧现代戏《村南柳》，就是一份难得的答卷。
      《村南柳》一反传统评戏那种才子佳人式的男欢女爱的简单描写，不仅描写了纯真的爱情，而且写出了爱的社会性与阶级性。农村青年杨秋菊与柳成林发生了强烈的真挚的爱，但是，残存的、顽固的封建意识却不留情地从外部以至从人的心灵的内部来禁锢、折磨这两颗爱恋的心。鬼使神差，恋人关系竟被残酷地铸成“婶侄”关系，历史的、社会的、阶级的因素，在这里显示了无穷的“权威”。戏剧就是以这样的思想深度，透过封建神权、族权、夫权如何撕破了人间那层温情脉脉的纱幕的形象描绘，唤起了观众对于更新社会、更新思想的强烈愿望。
    《村南柳》的人物塑造也不一般化。秋菊被迫离开自己心爱的柳成林，而嫁给自己不爱的柳根。但当她了解到病魔缠身的柳根的不幸时，她并不嫌弃他，而是更同情他；柳根长期卧病，明知不应耽误秋菊，但知道秋菊心中有人时，又无法抑制自己作为丈夫的“尊严”；那个被迫痛苦地把自己的恋人叫作婶子的柳成林，他是在爱不能爱、恨不忍恨的极其万般无奈的痛苦漩涡中，残忍地扭曲着自己的灵魂。戏剧就是在如此复杂的人物性格与心理变异中，跌宕起伏地展开着。特别到了“敬酒”一场，编演者们以大起大落的笔墨，先把三个人物的矛盾推到顶点，然后峰回路转，活脱出三颗挣扎在封建桎梏中的善良的心。
    更难得的是，一台既有深厚传统功底、又有创造力的演员。马淑华扮演的秋菊，在刘（翠霞）派艺术的基础上，结合自己的优越条件加以革新创造。不论是表现秋菊对成林的思恋，或者表现对自己不幸遭际的血泪控诉时，所运用的大段的、复杂的评剧声腔，都能声情并茂地表现出人物此时此刻的具体心态。特别是到了要寻短见前的那段唱腔，由倒板、散板、反调、清板直到大悲调的连缀，既表现出演员的深厚的艺术造诣，同时又集中地表现出演员驾驭传统技艺塑造新人物的本领。李秀云扮演的七奶奶也十分成功。她以醇厚大方、收放自如的、典型的“大口落子”的那种抓人的声腔与韵味，把一个深受封建礼法毒害，又要以封建礼法害人的“丑婆子”演的活灵活现。特别是她在临终前教训媳妇守节的那段搭调转影调唱腔，唱足，唱够，既让观众过了戏瘾，又让观众形象地感觉到这个可恶的封建老太的那种“死不甘心”的可怕的灵魂。看得出来，她们都借鉴了现代艺术由内到外的表演方法，才使他们的人物具有明晰的层次与深度，所以令人信服，给人以感染。
