Let us take a look at the heart of an old intellectual, a university teacher, an ordinary Chinese person, and see how much weight patriotism carries.

He is Gao Hongye, a professor at Renmin University of China and an expert in modern Western economics. In the spring of 1956, Gao Hongye, who had just been appointed as an associate professor at the University of Missouri's School of Management, faced a serious choice: whether to stay in the land of the stars and stripes or return to the place where the five-star red flag rises.

Gao Hongye hails from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, and was born in Fuzhou in 1921. In 1944, he graduated from Jiao Tong University with a bachelor's degree in engineering. He then switched to economics, going to the United States in 1945, where he studied at the University of Colorado and the University of California, from undergraduate to Ph.D. in economics in 1955. Later, at the recommendation of Professor McCloy, he went to teach at the University of Missouri.

During this period, in another hemisphere, the motherland was undergoing drastic changes, and New China rose like the sun in the East.

Gao Hongye's relatives often sent encouraging news from the motherland; from American newspapers, he read articles by American POWs in the Korean War: Chinese volunteers refused to accept money and goods from POWs; life as a POW was hard, but there were no complaints, because the lives of Chinese soldiers were as hard as theirs... He sincerely admired, "Amazing!"

Finally, this 35-year-old young scholar was eager to return home. He told his friends that staying permanently in the United States would mean having a house and a car before the end of his life, but that would be all. If he could not do something for the motherland that raised him, he would regret it for life and it would be irreparable. "Return to the motherland, otherwise I will regret it for life," he said.

In his letters home, Gao Hongye passionately expressed his desire to serve his country. His relatives sought help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic. Gao Hongye's name was included in the list of Chinese students and technical personnel in the United States, sent to the negotiating table of the Chinese and American ambassadors in Warsaw.

In March 1957, Gao Hongye finally returned to the embrace of his beloved socialist motherland.

In the tide of reform and opening up, "Modern Western Economics" became a "hot" subject. Gao Hongye's classroom often saw a "full house" of listeners. Students eagerly attending classes is a sign of respect for the teacher. Gao Hongye, while feeling understood and pleased, also felt a hint of unease: the blind admiration for the West among some inexperienced young people was growing. The phrase "Modern Western" had become a mysterious halo.

Gao Hongye believed that it was not surprising for inexperienced students to develop thoughts of admiring Western theories, the key was how to guide them. Teachers have the responsibility to help students, under the guidance of Marxism, understand the full picture of Western economics, eliminate the mystery, and see it for what it is, and then make correct judgments.

In class, he openly and unambiguously stated: "Modern Western economics is a component of bourgeois ideology, and its core content is to defend the existence of the capitalist system. We study it, first, to know ourselves and others, to counterattack, and second, to distinguish between good and bad and make it useful to us."

Gao Hongye insisted on using Marxist principles, views, and methods to introduce Western economics, but he never simply quoted Marx's original words to "label" things; he insisted on introducing comprehensive knowledge of modern Western economics, explaining the origins, developments, and latest trends in a deep yet accessible way, without exaggerating or covering up; he analyzed and dissected the internal contradictions of Western economic theories and the actual economic life's verification of these theories, proving that the entire theoretical system lacks scientific value, but he did not deny that some individual points, concepts, and methods are worth learning from.

Whether in teaching, writing books, or translating representative works of Western economics, he always reminded people to eliminate blind admiration and correctly treat Western economics.

Students highly praised Gao Hongye's academic style. Whether they were Ph.D. students, master's students, or undergraduates, they all reflected that Professor Gao's arguments were reasonable and convincing. Some students said, "He is someone who can delve into the details and then step back out."

Some students asked a teacher in the same department, "Professor Gao Hongye has lived abroad for so long. Is what he is saying now sincere?" The teacher couldn't help but smile and said to the students, "Comrade Gao Hongye is a serious economist. He has a strong foundation in mathematics, high language proficiency, and is well-informed academically. He has deep insights into using Marxism to study and introduce Western economics. What he says is the result of his years of in-depth research and his consistent academic stance."

The facts are indeed like this.

In 1979, Gao Hongye translated "Economics" by Samuelson. In the preface to the Chinese translation, he said: In the later ten articles he wrote commenting on Samuelson's "Economics," in works such as "Contemporary Bourgeois Economic Thought" and "Modern Western Economic Theory and Schools," he also said the same; in various important meetings, in the classroom of the macroeconomic training center where the main instructors were foreign scholars, in exchanges of views with domestic and foreign economists, he still said the same; especially when bourgeois liberalization was rampant, advocating Western economics became a kind of fashionable trend, and even during the period of turmoil, he still insisted on saying the same.

This way of speaking is the conclusion he drew after seriously analyzing Western economics, and it also reflects his sense of responsibility as a patriot. Gao Hongye believed that a country must have a dominant ideology, otherwise it would be difficult to unite and integrate. In recent years, some countries have experienced fragmentation, one of the reasons being the confusion or pluralism of ideology. Gao Hongye believed that the Chinese people, through long-term revolutionary struggles, chose socialism, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought as their dominant ideology, and could not allow capitalist ideology to spread freely, otherwise it would endanger the country's security and unity. This is the true meaning of patriotism. Socialist university teachers have the responsibility to educate the younger generation to love their motherland from the height of ideological struggle. Professor Gao Hongye often admonished his students: When borrowing certain concepts, methods, and points from Western economics, first consider whether they are suitable for China's national conditions. Having patriotism without understanding the national conditions will lead to contrary results.

He often said that there are no two completely identical countries in the world. The situation in Beijing is very different from that in other places. The experience of various countries shows that simply transplanting Western factories to developing countries will often fail. Because the social environment and economic and technological conditions on which they depend have changed.

Based on the needs of the country's economic construction and economic theory research, and starting from the actual national conditions, Gao Hongye conducted in-depth research and discussion on the issue of how Western economics can be used for our benefit, and put forward many valuable suggestions. He felt that econometrics, created by the West, can be fully applied to China's actual economic work and economic research, so he advocated and assisted the university and the State Education Commission in establishing a graduate class in econometrics at Renmin University to train specialized talents for the country.

During a previous period, some people blindly applied Keynesian theory, advocating that China should implement policies to increase consumption and stimulate production. Gao Hongye believed that Keynesian's theory did not match China's economic situation at all. Even in the West, this theory is difficult to say how effective it is. He wrote an article pointing out that the economic activities of Western capitalist countries are generally restricted by demand with purchasing power, and their economic policies are intended to control the economy's development through demand. China is a socialist country, and economic activities are often restricted by resources on the supply side. Using demand control to solve problems from supply-side restrictions is obviously useless.

Hearing someone in the economics community openly advocate the idea of "everything for money," Gao Hongye felt it was a big problem. He believed that "everything for money" is the standard of economic life under the Western market mechanism, and if it is copied to socialist China, it will cause great harm. He pointed out that a comprehensive understanding of the market mechanism is necessary to make use of it while avoiding its possible negative consequences.

Whether in lectures or participating in academic conferences and writing articles, Gao Hongye always analyzed issues from China's national conditions. People saw from him that his patriotic spirit was built on a thorough understanding of the national conditions, with a solid foundation.

With the rise of the trend to study abroad, young people often asked Gao Hongye to help them arrange to go abroad, to advise them on research directions, or to talk about foreign customs and how to interact with people.

Almost to everyone, Gao Hongye asked them to pay attention to this English idiom: "Hold your head up, but not too high." He meant not to belittle oneself because of yellow skin and a not yet wealthy country, but also not to be overly arrogant and lose the Chinese virtue of humility and caution.

He often reminded them to learn things that are truly useful to the country, and not to pick up some flashy but useless fashionable items.

Two young people who were going to the United States to study international finance came to say goodbye. Gao Hongye told them that the theories in books can be learned in New York, London, and Beijing, but the important thing is to seize the opportunity to intern for a period in American banks and financial institutions to master the business knowledge that is not in the books, so that what is learned may truly be useful to the country.

In 1987, Gao Hongye was again invited to be a visiting professor at the Arizona International Management Institute in the United States, teaching Chinese economics. This is a school that trains international trade talents. During the teaching, Gao Hongye tried his best to make the students understand this truth: establishing connections with China and developing trade with China is ultimately beneficial to their own country. He hoped that these students would have long-term and extensive trade exchanges with China. Later, some students in the class indeed took on the work of trade with China and were very happy to visit Renmin University to see Professor Gao Hongye, who had guided them to China.

Although he went abroad to teach and visit several times, in his home, daily necessities including household appliances were all Chinese products. When asked the reason, this economist sighed, "It's easy to enjoy, but it's difficult to create. Our country used to not even be able to make bicycles, but now we can manufacture rockets, atomic bombs, and nuclear submarines. I feel genuinely happy. When foreign friends come to my home, I can tell them which items are made in China, which is a very pleasant thing."

    一位大学教师的爱国情怀
    ——记人大经济系高鸿业教授
    李梦超
    让我们看一看一位老知识分子，一位大学老师，一个普通中国人的胸臆间，爱国具有多么重的分量。
    他，是中国人民大学博士生导师，现代西方经济学专家高鸿业教授。
    1956年春季，就任美国密苏里大学管理学院副教授的高鸿业博士，面临着一项严肃的选择：是留在这星条旗飘扬的国度，还是回到那五星红旗升起的地方。
    高鸿业原籍江苏省徐州市，1921年出生于福州。1944年他毕业于交通大学，获工程学士学位。后改学经济，1945年到美国，先后进入科罗拉多大学和加利福尼亚大学，从本科学起，直到1955年获经济学博士学位。后经老师麦克科亚教授推荐，到密苏里大学任教。
    这期间，远在另一个半球的祖国地覆天翻，新中国像一轮红日升起在世界东方。
    高鸿业的亲人们时时从祖国传来令人鼓舞的讯息；从美国报纸上，他读到了在抗美援朝战争中被俘美军人员的文章：志愿军战士拒收战俘钱财物品；战俘生活很苦却没有怨言，原因是中国军人的生活同他们一样苦……他由衷地赞叹：“了不起！”
    终于，这位35岁的青年学者归心似箭了。他对朋友们讲，永久地留在美国，在生命结束前会拥有房子、汽车，但是整个生命换来的不过如此。如果不能亲身为养育自己的祖国做些事情，那会终生遗憾，不能弥补。“回祖国，不然我会终生遗憾的”他说。
    在家信中，高鸿业热烈地倾诉报国之情。他的亲人向人民共和国外交部求助。高鸿业的名字被列入旅美中国留学生和技术人员名单，送到了华沙中美大使的谈判桌上。
    1957年3月，高鸿业终于回到了日夜向往的社会主义祖国怀抱。
    在改革开放的大潮中，“现代西方经济学”成为“热门”学科。高鸿业的课堂时常出现听众“爆满”的情景。学生踊跃听课是对教师的尊重。高鸿业在理解、欣慰之余，却闪现了一丝的不安：一些涉世未深的青年人盲目崇拜西方的情绪在日益滋长。“现代西方”这个词变成了一个高深莫测的光环。
    高鸿业认为，在涉世不深的学生中产生崇拜西方学说的思想不奇怪，关键在于如何去引导他们。教师有责任帮助学生在马克思主义指导下，了解西方经济学的全貌，消除神秘感，还其本来面目，进而作出正确判断。
    在课堂上，他开宗明义毫不含糊地讲：“现代西方经济学是资产阶级意识形态的组成部分，其核心内容是在为资本主义制度的存在作辩护。我们研究它，一是要知己知彼，针锋相对，二是要分别良莠为我所用。”
    高鸿业坚持用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法评介西方经济学，却从不简单摘引马克思的原话“贴标签”；他坚持介绍现代西方经济学的全面知识，深入浅出地讲清来龙去脉、最新发展，从不以偏盖全，夸大其辞；他从西方经济学理论的内部矛盾中，从实际经济生活对这些理论的检验上，层层分析解剖，证明其整个理论体系缺乏科学价值，却并不抹煞其个别论点、概念和方法有值得借鉴之处。
    无论是执教讲学，还是著书立说、翻译西方经济学的代表性著作，他都时时提醒人们消除盲目崇拜心理，正确对待西方经济学。
    学生们很推崇高鸿业的学术风格，无论是博士生、硕士生还是本科生都反映：高老师的论证入情入理，说服力很强。有的同学说：“他是个能钻到里面又能跳出来的人。”
    有的学生问本系一位老师：“高鸿业老师在国外生活那么久，他现在讲的是真心话吗？”这位老师不由得笑了，他对学生说：“高鸿业同志是一位严肃的经济学家。他数学底子厚，外语水平高，学术信息灵，在运用马克思主义研究评介西方经济学方面造诣很深。他所讲的是他多年来潜心研究的成果，也是他一贯坚持的学术主张。”
    事实正是如此。
    1979年高鸿业翻译的萨缪尔森《经济学》出版。在中译本序言中，他是这样讲；在后来所写的评论萨缪尔森《经济学》的十篇文章中，在《当代资产阶级经济学说》、《现代西方经济理论与流派》等诸多著述中，他也是这样讲；在各类重要会议上，在主要由外国学者授课的宏观经济培训中心的课堂上，在同国内外经济学家交换意见时，他还是这样讲；尤其在资产阶级自由化严重泛滥，鼓吹西方经济学成为某种时髦风尚，甚至在发生动乱期间，他仍然坚持这样讲。
    这样的讲法，是他对西方经济学认真分析后而得出的结论，也反映了他爱国主义的责任感。高鸿业认为，一个国家必须有一种主导的意识形态，否则很难团结统一。近些年来有的国家出现四分五裂的局面，原因之一是意识形态的混乱或者多元化。高鸿业认为，我国各族人民在长期革命斗争中，选择社会主义、马列主义毛泽东思想作为自己的主导意识形态，就不能容许资本主义意识形态自由泛滥，否则就会危及国家的安全和统一。这才是爱国思想的真谛。社会主义大学教师有责任从意识形态斗争的高度，教育青年一代热爱自己的祖国。高鸿业教授经常告诫学生：在借鉴西方经济学的某些概念、方法、论点时，首先要考虑是否适合中国国情。光有爱国热情而不了解国情，就会事与愿违。
    他经常讲，世界上没有两个完全一样的国家。北京的情况与外地就有很多不同。各国发展的经验表明，把西方国家的工厂原封不动地搬到发展中国家，十有八九会招致失败。因为它赖以生存的社会环境、经济技术条件发生了变化。
    高鸿业根据国家经济建设和经济理论研究的需要，从实际国情出发，对西方经济学如何为我所用的问题作了深入的研究探讨，提出了不少有价值的建议。他感到西方创立的计量经济学作为一种方法，完全可以运用于我国实际经济工作和经济研究中去，因而多方呼吁，建议并协助学校和国家教委在人民大学设立了计量经济学研究生班，以便为国家培养专门人才。
    前一时期，有人盲目套用凯恩斯主义理论，主张我国实行增加消费、刺激生产的政策。高鸿业认为，凯恩斯的这个理论与中国经济情况根本对不上号。即使在西方这个理论也很难说有多少作用。他撰文指出，西方资本主义国家的经济活动，一般受有支付能力的需求方面的限制，其经济政策是企图通过需求控制经济的发展。我国是社会主义国家，经济活动往往受处于供给方面的资源的限制。用控制需求的手段解决来自供给方面限制的问题，显然是无用的。
    听到经济学界有人公然鼓吹“一切向钱看”的论调，高鸿业觉得很成问题。他认为，一切向钱看是西方市场机制下经济生活的准则，照搬到社会主义制度下的中国，危害很大。他指出，必须对市场机制作全面的了解，才能利用它却又能避免它可能带来的消极后果。
    不论是讲课还是参加学术会议、著文，高鸿业处处从我国的国情出发来分析问题。人们从他身上看到，他的爱国精神是建立在对国情的充分了解之上的，有着坚实的基础。
    随着出国潮的涌起，时常有些青年人请高鸿业帮助联系出国，请他参谋确定研究方向，或者请他讲异国风土人情、如何待人接物。
    几乎对每个人，高鸿业都请他们注意这样一句英文的成语：“抬起下颏，但不过分。”他指的是，不因黄肤色和国家尚不富裕而自轻自贱，但也不要过于狂妄而失掉中国人谦虚谨慎的美德。
    他嘱咐较多的是：要学习对国家确有用的东西，不要捡回一些华而不实的时髦货色。
    两位赴美学国际金融的青年前来辞行。高鸿业对他们说，书本上的理论在纽约，在伦敦，在北京都可以学到，重要的是抓住机会，到美国的银行、金融机构实习一个时期，掌握那些书本上没有的业务知识，这样学得的东西可能真正对国家有用。
    1987年，高鸿业再次应聘任亚利桑那美国国际管理学院客座教授，讲授中国经济。这是一所培养国际贸易人才的学校。教课中间，高鸿业努力使学生明白这样一个道理：建立同中国的联系，发展同中国的贸易，归根结蒂对他们自己的国家也是有利的。他希望这些学生在贸易上与中国长期广泛地交往。后来班上有些学生果然担负了对华贸易工作，并很高兴地到人民大学看望导引他们来中国的高鸿业老师。
    他虽然几次出国讲学、考察，但在他的家中，生活用品包括家用电器等都是中国货。问起缘由，这位经济学家感慨地说：“享受很容易，困难的是创造。我们国家过去连自行车都造不出来，现在能制造火箭、原子弹、核潜艇，我感到由衷地高兴。外国朋友来我家作客，我能告诉他们哪些物品是中国自己制造的，那是一件非常惬意的事情。”
