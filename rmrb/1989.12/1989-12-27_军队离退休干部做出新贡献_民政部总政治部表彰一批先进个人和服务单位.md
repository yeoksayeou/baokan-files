	Military Retired Cadres Make New Contributions
	Ministry of Civil Affairs and General Political Department Honor a Group of Advanced Individuals and Service Units

	BEIJING, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Political Department recently announced the commendation of 498 national advanced military retired cadres handed over to local governments for placement and management, 100 advanced workers in the service and management of military retired cadres, and 50 advanced military retired cadre rest homes. This is the first nationwide commendation since military retired cadres were handed over to local governments for placement and management.

	Since the People's Liberation Army established the officer retirement system in 1958, over 50,000 retired cadres have been handed over to the government's civil affairs departments for placement and management. These retired cadres respect the leadership of local governments, carry forward the fine traditions of the Party and the army, consciously maintain their revolutionary integrity, and have made new contributions to the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization. Many outstanding figures have emerged among them. Those honored this time are outstanding representatives among them. Some of them took a firm stand and clearly distinguished right from wrong in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riots in the spring and summer of this year, defending the socialist regime with practical actions; some participated in economic construction and management, contributing to the Four Modernizations; some worked hard for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization; and some supported the construction of their hometowns and did good deeds for the people.

	The Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Political Department's announcement hopes that all military retired cadres will better maintain their revolutionary integrity and continue to contribute to China's socialist cause; it also hopes that the rest homes will raise the service and management work for military retired cadres to a new level.
