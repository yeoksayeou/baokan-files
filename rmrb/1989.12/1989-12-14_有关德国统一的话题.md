The recent dramatic changes in the political situation in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) have made the issue of German unification a hot topic in Western media. Although international opinion believes that German unification is not yet realistic under current circumstances, both Eastern and Western countries are closely monitoring future developments and actively engaging in various activities.

The division of Germany into two states is a result of the post-World War II settlement. With the opening of the Berlin Wall and the free movement between East and West Germany, some political figures in West Germany believe that the issue of German unification "faces an unprecedented favorable opportunity." Consequently, discussions in West Germany have intensified, with various parties exploring the possibility of German unification. On November 28, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl presented a "Ten-Point Plan" for achieving German unification in the Bundestag. This plan advocates for the development of a "federal structure" between the two Germanys, aiming to eventually establish a "federation." However, one condition for this is that the GDR must have a "democratically legitimate government," and it explicitly demands that the GDR "must abolish the monopoly on power held by the Socialist Unity Party" and supports the holding of so-called "free elections" in the GDR. The "Ten-Point Plan" also includes economic demands, advocating for the GDR to "abolish the planned economy" and "establish market economic conditions." Kohl also believes that the issue of German unification should be linked to the process of European integration and East-West relations. The implications of West Germany's stance are clear: it is essentially a reiteration of its long-standing position on "self-determination," as pointed out by some Western opinions. It aims to take advantage of the changing situation in the GDR to achieve its goal of "unifying" the eastern part of Germany.

After the release of Kohl's "Ten-Point Plan," it sparked strong reactions in the GDR. A GDR government spokesperson pointed out that the plan "does not conform to reality and is likely to cause confusion." It "ignores the basic treaty between the two Germanys and the Helsinki Final Act, which stipulate the sovereignty and independence of the two Germanys." GDR leaders clearly stated that "in the relationship between the two Germanys, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality, and non-interference must be followed, and the issue of reunification should not be on the agenda." A petition signed by famous writers, artists, and scientists explicitly opposes the reunification of the two Germanys and opposes West Germany's attempt to "annex" the GDR with a "haughty attitude." A public opinion poll conducted in Berlin showed that 83% of respondents support the continued existence of a sovereign socialist democratic GDR.

On the issue of German unification, Soviet leaders have repeatedly emphasized in recent speeches that "German unification is not a problem to be solved at present." They stress the fact that there are two sovereign German states recognized by the United Nations, which is a historical outcome, and therefore, the issue of reunification should also be resolved by history. "Artificially forcing German unification will only complicate the current situation in Europe." The TASS news agency commented that Kohl's ten-point plan "is worrying" because it will encourage those in West Germany who "openly advocate for redrawing borders." The Soviet Union has consistently emphasized that the current borders of European countries, as stipulated in the Helsinki Final Act, are "the reality on which European security and stability depend." Given that the GDR is a frontline position of the Warsaw Pact, with 380,000 Soviet troops stationed there, its position is crucial. Some international opinions point out that if Germany reunifies, it will inevitably accelerate the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and threaten the security of the Soviet Union's post-World War II sphere of influence and western borders. The Soviet Union's concerns on this issue are not unfounded.

The issue of German unification is also a sensitive one in the West. If the two Germanys unite, it will disrupt the current balance of power, not only affecting the European landscape but also influencing the global situation. The West has its own considerations on this matter. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, in a recent speech, expressed "support" for Kohl's ten-point plan while also proposing four conditions for German unification: it must adhere to the principle of self-determination; unification must be achieved under the condition that West Germany continues to maintain its ties with NATO and the European Community, "unification should not be exchanged for neutrality"; unification should be a "peaceful and gradual" process, beneficial to Europe's "overall stability"; and it should recognize the current borders of European countries after World War II. On December 4, President Bush reiterated these four points at the NATO summit. The four conditions proposed by Baker reflect the complex sentiments of the United States on the issue of German unification. Although President Bush has repeatedly stated that the United States does not fear that German unification will pose a military threat to the United States, if the two Germanys, with nearly 80 million people and 2.4 trillion marks, achieve unification, it will pose a significant political and economic challenge to the United States. Moreover, German unification will ultimately lead to the dissolution of the two major military blocs in Europe and force the United States to gradually withdraw its military forces from Europe, fundamentally shaking the post-war Yalta system and presenting the United States with a series of new problems. The reason the United States proposes that German unification should not lead to German neutrality and should not change the post-war European borders is to bring the process of German unification into the orbit of U.S. policy towards Europe and the East-West, so as to plan for the long term and guide this process in a direction favorable to the United States.

Most Western European countries harbor doubts about German unification and have a cool response to Kohl's plan. Although some Western European countries have expressed "sympathy and understanding" for Kohl's plan, in reality, they fear that a unified Germany will become a strong economic competitor, even a dominant "Fourth Reich" in Europe. Western European countries are also concerned that German unification will disrupt the current structure of NATO and the European Community, hindering the process of European integration with the European Community as its core. Some Western European politicians even worry that the "power centers in Europe will increase," and Europe may return to the state of national and state conflicts seen in the 19th century. Overall, due to geographical reasons, Western Europe has more considerations on the issue of German unification than the United States. French President Mitterrand recently stated, "If we still want to keep the opportunity for peace, we should not easily change the borders."

Discussions on German unification by Eastern and Western countries have almost covered all diplomatic stages. From the Malta summit between the U.S. and Soviet leaders to meetings of NATO and Warsaw Pact leaders, from West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's visit to the Soviet Union to French President Mitterrand's visit to the Soviet Union, the issue of German unification has been a topic of discussion. According to reports, Western leaders, after consultations, have reached a consensus on issues such as the "gradual process" of German unification and that it should be conducted under the control of the CSCE, the European Community, and NATO. It seems that whether it is the Warsaw Pact or NATO, neither bloc wants to hastily disrupt the current European balance of power and stability due to this issue.

    有关德国统一的话题
    张德真
    民主德国政局近来急剧的变化，使德国统一问题成为西方报刊上的热门话题。尽管国际舆论认为，在当前情势下，德国统一尚不现实，但东西方各国正密切关注未来的动向，并正积极进行着各种活动。
    两个德国的局面是第二次世界大战后形成的格局。现今随着柏林墙的开放，东西德之间的自由来往，西德某些政界人士认为德国统一问题“面临着从未有过的有利时机”，于是西德政坛上议论蜂起，纷纷探讨起德国统一的可能性。11月28日西德总理科尔在联邦议院提出了关于实现德国统一的“十点计划”。这项计划主张首先发展两个德国之间的“邦联结构”，以便最终建立一个“联邦”，不过这方面的一个条件是民德有一个“民主合法性的政府”，并且还公然提出民德“必须取消统一社会党对权力的垄断”，支持在民德进行所谓“自由选举”。“十点计划”还提出了经济方面的要求，主张民德“必须取消计划经济”，“建立市场经济条件”。科尔还认为德国统一问题应同欧洲一体化进程以及东西方关系“联系”起来。西德的主张含意十分明显，无非是它过去一贯坚持的“人民自决”版本的翻版，正像西方某些舆论所指出的，它是想乘民德局势变化之际，实现其把德国东部“统一”过来的企图。
    科尔的“十点计划”发表后，在民主德国引起了强烈反应。民德政府发言人指出，科尔计划“不符合现实，而且容易造成混乱”，它“无视两德关系基础条约和赫尔辛基最后文件所规定的两个德国的主权与独立性”。民德领导人明确表示，“在两个德国的关系中，应遵循相互尊重主权、领土完整、平等和互不干涉的原则，重新统一的问题提不到议事日程上。”一份由著名作家、艺术家、科学家签名的呼吁书明确提出反对两个德国重新统一，反对西德以
  “傲慢态度”“吞并”民德的企图。在柏林进行的一项民意调查表明，83％的人赞成“一个主权的社会主义民主德国继续存在下去”。
    在德国统一问题上，苏联领导人在最近的讲话中多次重申“德国统一问题不是当前要解决的问题”，强调存在两个主权的、被联合国承认的德意志国家这一事实，是由历史造成的，因此，重新统一问题也应由历史来解决，“人为地强行推行德国统一只会使欧洲现有进程复杂化”。塔斯社在一篇评论中说科尔的十点计划“令人忧虑”，因为它将鼓励西德那些“公开拥护重新划定边界者的热情”。苏联一直强调，二次大战后确定的、由赫尔辛基最后文件载明的欧洲各国现行边界是“欧洲安全与稳定赖以依存的现实”。鉴于民主德国是华约的前沿阵地，仅苏联在民德的驻军就有38万人，地位十分重要。一些国际舆论指出，如果德国重新统一，势必加速华约解体，危及苏联二次大战后所划定的势力范围和西部边界的安全。苏联在这个问题上的担忧不是没有原因的。
    德国统一问题不仅在东方，在西方也是一个敏感的问题。因为两个德国如果合而为一，就将会打破目前的力量对比，不仅影响欧洲的格局，而且将影响世界的大局。西方对此也各有自己的考虑。美国国务卿贝克在最近一次讲话中一方面对科尔的十点计划表示“支持”，同时又提出了德国统一的“四个条件”，即：必须实行自决原则；必须在西德继续同北约和欧共体保持联结的条件下实现统一，“不应以中立换取统一”；统一是“和平的、渐进的”过程，要有利于欧洲“全面稳定”；承认战后欧洲各国现行边界。12月4日布什总统在北约首脑会议上再次重申了这四点立场。贝克提出的四个条件集中反映了美国在德国统一问题上的复杂心情。尽管布什总统一再声称美国不担心德国统一会在军事上对美国构成威胁，但是如果拥有近8000万人口、2.4万亿马克的两个德国实现统一，在政治上、经济上对美国不啻是一个严重挑战。而且，德国统一最终必将导致欧洲两大军事集团的解体和迫使美国军事力量逐步撤出欧洲，这将从根本上动摇战后的雅尔塔格局，使美国的全球战略面临着一系列新的问题。美国之所以提出德国统一不能导致德国中立化，不能变动战后欧洲边界等前提条件，其用意就在于要将德国统一进程纳入美国对欧洲和东西方政策的轨道，以便从长计议，使这一进程沿着对美国有利的方向发展。
    西欧国家大多对德国统一心存疑虑，对科尔计划反应冷淡。尽管有的西欧国家对科尔计划也表示
  “同情和理解”，但实际上它们害怕一个统一的德国会成为它们经济上强大的竞争对手，甚至成为主宰欧洲的“德意志第四帝国”。西欧国家还担心德国统一将打破北约和欧共体目前的格局，妨碍以欧共体为核心的欧洲一体化进程。有的西欧政治家甚至忧虑欧洲“权力中心会增多”，欧洲可能出现19世纪那样的民族和国家纷争状态。总起来看，由于地理原因，西欧在德国统一问题上比美国考虑得更多。法国总统密特朗最近表示，“如果还想保留和平机会的话，就不能轻易改动边界”。
    东西方围绕着德国统一问题的议论几乎遍及各个外交舞台。从马耳他美苏首脑会晤到北约和华约领导人会议，从西德外长根舍访苏到法国总统密特朗访苏，会谈中无不涉及德国统一问题。据报道，西方领导人经过磋商，对德国统一应遵循“渐进进程”、“应在欧安会、欧共体和北约组织三方控制下进行”等问题上已取得共识。看来，无论华约还是北约集团都不希望因这个问题匆忙打破欧洲现有的均势，破坏欧洲的稳定。
