The provinces, prefectures (cities), and counties of Anhui are working together to strengthen rural party and government organizations, ensuring that the party and government's grassroots positions in rural areas are consolidated and strengthened.

In recent years, the Liu'an region has used over 400 evening party schools and more than 160 educational points to educate more than 6,000 rural party branch cadres on the party's "one center, two basic points." The Fuyang region has used more than 10 county (city) party schools and over 600 district and township evening party schools and educational points to train all the township committee cadres in the region in batches, democratically electing over 4,000 township committees.

The counties of Suzhou, Chuzhou, and Fuyang, as well as the cities of Hefei and Huangshan, have sent over 2,000 young and capable cadres to rural areas to serve as party branch secretaries, township committee directors, or other positions. The Fuyang region has recently seen many moving scenes of old secretaries, old commissioners, and old cadres sending their children to support agriculture in rural areas.

Rural grassroots cadres are on the front lines of grain collection, fund collection, and family planning, facing significant challenges and low living standards. In response to this situation, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee issued a call in May this year for the entire province to learn from the hardworking entrepreneurial spirit of the Xinzhong Village Party Branch in Shitai County. Various regions (cities) and counties have changed their past practices of "more criticism, less care," successively establishing their own grassroots models, promoting positive energy, and boosting morale. At the same time, they have developed service-oriented village economies, enhancing the village's "blood-making" and service functions, reducing the burden on farmers, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

### 调整充实班子　支持爱护干部  安徽抓紧农村基层党政建设

    调整充实班子　支持爱护干部
    安徽抓紧农村基层党政建设
    本报合肥12月29日电　记者张振国报道：安徽省、地（市）、县齐心协力抓紧农村党政组织建设，使党和政府在农村的基层阵地得以巩固加强。
    近几年来，六安地区通过400多所业余党校和160多个电教点，对6000多个农村党支部的主要干部进行了党的“一个中心，两个基本点”的教育。阜阳地区通过10多所县（市）党校和600多所区乡业余党校、电教点，分期分批培训了全区村委会干部，民主选举产生4000多个村委会。
    宿县、滁县、阜阳等地区和合肥、黄山等市，为改变少数基层党政组织“软、散、懒”状况，先后选派2000多名年轻有为的干部到农村任党支部书记、村委会主任或其他职务，阜阳地区新近出现许多老书记、老专员、老干部送子下乡支农的动人场面。
    农村基层干部处在催粮、收款、搞计划生育的第一线，工作难度大，生活待遇低。安徽省委根据这一情况，于今年5月号召全省学习石台县新中村党支部艰苦创业的事迹。各地（市）、县也改变了过去“指责多、关怀少”的做法，相继树立了各自的基层典型，弘扬了正气，鼓舞了士气。同时，他们注意发展了服务型村级经济，增强了村的“造血”和服务功能，既减轻了农民负担，又密切了干群关系。
