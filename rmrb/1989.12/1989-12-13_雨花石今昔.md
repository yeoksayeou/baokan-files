Rainflower Stone, a name rich with poetic charm, originates from a beautiful myth. Legend has it that over 1,400 years ago, during the Southern Dynasties' Liang period, the high monk Yun Guang, at the Stone Hill outside Nanjing's Zhonghua Gate, set up a platform to preach. His sincere devotion moved the heavens to rain flowers, which upon hitting the ground, transformed into colorful stones. During the Northern Song Dynasty's Daguang period, the official Lu Xuan, based on this legend, formally named Yun Guang's preaching platform "Rainflower Terrace." By the late Ming Dynasty, Rainflower Terrace had evolved from a platform name to a place name, and people began to call the colorful stones produced there "Rainflower Stones."

Today, while people still delight in this myth, modern science has unveiled the secrets of Rainflower Stones. Rainflower Stones are found in the "Rainflower Terrace Pebble Layer" (including areas like Liuhe and Yizheng). Their formation dates back to 12 to 30 million years ago, during a geological period when the ancient Yangtze River flowed through the Liuhe area of Nanjing. The rushing waters carried and ground down rock fragments and mineral debris from the middle and upper reaches and nearby mountains, forming pebbles that settled and formed a pebble layer. Nanjing, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is a gathering place for both distant "outsiders" and local "residents" from the Yangtze River basin, forming a large family of various types of pebbles. This family is diverse and rich. In terms of composition, it includes agate, opal, quartz, crystal, and other materials like stone marrow and flint. Any stone with aesthetic and collectible value is called a "Rainflower Stone."

Thus, Rainflower Stones are a marvel of nature, embodying natural beauty. They gather the essence of the heavens and earth, the radiance of the sun and moon, and the charm of all things, making them the finest among stones. In nature, there are many ornamental stones, each with its unique charm, but none can match the delicacy, vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and vivid imagery of Rainflower Stones. Moreover, in some aspects, Rainflower Stones can rival gemstones. Ancient people praised Rainflower Stones, saying, "They surpass jade and agate, hence their value." In terms of color, pattern, and imagery, Rainflower Stones are not gemstones but are as exquisite as gemstones, thus rightly earning the titles "Heavenly Gift" and "Unique Treasure of China."

The rare specimens of Rainflower Stones are natural artworks. Their wondrous patterns and rich colors create endless images and scenes—mountains and rivers, seasonal landscapes, flowers, birds, insects, fish, and human figures, all captured in vivid detail. If nature is the original art gallery of humanity, then Rainflower Stones are a miniature of this gallery. In this natural art gallery, one can observe ancient and modern scenes, admire famous landscapes from China and abroad, and experience the joy of travel without the labor of climbing, making one's spirit soar and heart feel expansive.

Due to its refined aesthetic appeal, Rainflower Stones have been cherished and collected since ancient times. In 1955, artifacts unearthed in Nanjing's Yinyangying proved that as early as 5,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period, ancient people used Rainflower Stones as ornaments and treasures, even burying them as grave goods. Entering civilized society, anyone who encountered Rainflower Stones, especially scholars and connoisseurs, became enamored with them, writing about, composing poems, singing praises, and painting them. Thus, Rainflower Stones have long been a unique cultural phenomenon and an integral part of Chinese culture. Recently, the "Rainflower Stone Collectors' Treasures and Rainflower Stone Artists' Works Joint Exhibition" held at the Nanjing Museum, and the large-scale art album "Rainflower Stone Treasures" published jointly by Jiangsu Ancient Books Publishing House and Hong Kong Jia Bin Publishing House, have attracted attention from both Chinese and foreign audiences, opening up new prospects for the study and display of Rainflower Stone culture!

    雨花石今昔
    刘水
    雨花石，这富有诗情画意的芳名，来源于美丽的神话故事。相传距今1400多年前的南朝梁代高僧云光法师，在今南京中华门外的石子岗设台讲经，精诚所至，天为之雨花，落地化作五彩石子。北宋大观年间，吏部侍郎卢襄根据这一传说，正式给云光法师的讲经台命名为“雨花台”。到了明末，雨花台由“台号”演变成地名，人们遂将此处所产五彩石子称作“雨花石”。
    时至今日，人们虽然津津乐道于这一神话故事，但近代科学已揭示了雨花石的奥秘。雨花石产于“雨花台砾石层”（包括六合、仪征等地），它的形成年代可追溯到距今1200万年至300万年前的地质年代，那时古长江流经南京六合一带，奔腾的流水把中上游及周近山上风化的岩石和矿物碎块，搬运磨擦，成为卵石，沉积下来，形成砾石层。南京地处长江下游，远源的“外地来客”和近源的“土著居民”，即长江流域的多种类型的砾石，汇聚于此，组成一个大家族。这个家族的成员既多且丰。就其成分而言，有玛瑙质、蛋白质、石英质、水晶质以及石髓、燧石等等。凡是具有美学上观赏价值和收藏价值的，均称为“雨花石”。
    由此可知，雨花石是大自然的造化，她的主要特色是自然美。聚天地之灵气，化日月之光华，孕万物之风采，成石中之神品。自然界中有许多观赏石，各以其独特的风姿博得人们的赏识，但都不及雨花石那样玲珑剔透，五彩缤纷，纹理奇巧，形象生动。不仅如此，雨花石在某些方面，还可与宝石媲美。古人赞雨花石云：“有玉与玛瑙不能及，故足贵也。”就色彩、纹理和形象而言，雨花石不是宝石而胜似宝石，因而被誉为“天赐国宝”、“中国一绝”是当之无愧的。
    雨花石中的珍品，堪称天然艺术品。那奇妙的纹理和丰富的色彩，构成无穷无尽的图案和形象，日月山川，四时景色，花鸟虫鱼，人物风景，意象图案等等，大千世界，无所不具，千姿百态，形神兼美。如果说，大自然是人类原始艺术馆，那么雨花石则是这个原始艺术馆的缩影。在雨花石这个天然艺术馆里，可观古今风物，可览中外胜迹，既省登临之劳，而穷遨游之趣，令人情志高远，心旷神怡。
    由于雨花石具有如此高雅的审美情趣，因而自古以来，备受人们的喜爱和珍藏。1955年在南京市内阴阳营出土文物证明，早在5000年前的新石器时代，原始人就用雨花石作装饰品并被视为财富了，死后作为陪葬品。进入文明社会以后，凡是与雨花石有缘结识的人，尤其是文人雅士，无不成为雨花石的钟情人，并且为之著文、立谱、讴歌、绘画。因此，雨花石早已是一种独特的文化现象而成为中华民族文化的组成部分了。最近在南京博物院举办的“雨花石收藏家珍品与雨花石艺术家作品联展”，以及由江苏古籍出版社和香港嘉宾出版社联合出版的大型艺术图集《雨花石珍品集》，引起中外人士注意，为研究雨花石文化，展示了前景！
