How to Cherish Every Inch of Land?

Both conservation and expansion are necessary.

Chen Zhiqiang, Yuelu County, Hunan Province

Cherishing every inch of land begins with conservation, managing and utilizing existing arable land properly, and preventing arable land from being arbitrarily occupied. However, conservation should not mean "cutting off the flow." Necessary land use cannot be avoided, and with the development of various undertakings, it may even increase. If we only focus on conservation without expanding, it will be impossible to stabilize arable land.

In many regions of China, there is significant potential for expansion. Take Yuelu County in Hunan Province, where land reserves are not abundant, as an example. According to agricultural zoning surveys, the county has over 110,000 mu of wasteland awaiting development. Of this, 590,000 mu can be cultivated into arable land, and 560,000 mu can be developed into orchards. These undeveloped lands are mostly located in hilly and ridge areas, relatively concentrated, with four large areas over 10,000 mu and eight large areas over 1,000 mu, all with slopes of less than 15 degrees. The soil types are diverse, including Quaternary red soil and weathered purple shale soil, with relatively thick soil layers. Additionally, 85% of the area is within several major irrigation districts. As long as the canals are extended, irrigation can be achieved through gravity flow. From both economic and ecological benefits, these lands have significant development value. Not only is there potential for expansion, but developing these lands is beneficial. Why not do it?

Over the past two years, the people of Yuelu County have focused on this and begun planned development of wastelands. Traditionally, winter agriculture only emphasized the "three winters": winter sowing, winter afforestation, and winter water conservancy construction. Now, with a unique approach, winter land reclamation has been added, making it the "four winters." The county committee and government have implemented a preferential policy of "three non-payments, two priorities, and one unchanged" for land development, stipulating that new reclaimed land will not be subject to agricultural taxes, mandatory grain procurement, or collective deductions for five years. Priority will be given to supplying fertilizers and diesel to villages, teams, and households that actively reclaim land, as well as providing assistance funds and loans. Under the principle of unchanged land ownership, the usage rights will remain unchanged for a long time. Various places have organized farmers to reclaim wasteland based on their actual situations. In 1988, the county developed 7,560 mu of new agricultural land, and in the first half of this year, an additional 2,400 mu were developed. In Wangling Town's Xinpu Village, there is a piece of wasteland where water flows over the slope and the land remains barren. This year, just after the spring, 9 village groups and 210 households of farmers reclaimed the slope, creating 102 mu of land, of which 80 mu of paddy fields were planted with rice. The early rice harvest alone yielded 17,500 kg of rice.

The wasteland is a great waste. On one hand, wasteland is left barren for years, and on the other hand, good land is gradually occupied, exacerbating the shortage of arable land. In the past two years, while Yuelu County has been strictly implementing "conservation," it has also focused on "expansion," significantly alleviating this contradiction. In 1988, various construction projects only occupied 357 mu of arable land, while new arable land reached 7,560 mu. After deducting the occupied area, the total arable land increased by 7,203 mu, with new arable land fully compensating for nearly a decade of land occupied by construction. From this, it can be seen that conservation and expansion, implemented simultaneously, are a comprehensive understanding and correct implementation of the important national policy of cherishing every inch of land.

Of course, expansion must be scientific and emphasize comprehensive benefits. If water and soil conservation are not prioritized and wasteland is recklessly reclaimed, it will be a major mistake. Such lessons are profound in China. We advocate for planned and step-by-step development of wasteland under the premise of emphasizing water and soil conservation and economic effectiveness, so that wasteland will no longer remain barren.

### 既要节流　也要开源

专栏：怎样珍惜每寸土地？

    既要节流　也要开源
    湖南省攸县　陈之强
    珍惜每一寸土地，首要的是节流，管好用好现有耕地，不让耕地随便被占用。但是，节流决不可“断流”，必要的占地不仅不可少，随着各项事业的发展，甚至会呈增长趋势。如果只讲节流，不抓开源，耕地是无法得以稳定的。
    开源，在我国相当多的地区是大有潜力可挖的。就以土地后备资源不够充裕的湖南攸县为例，据农业区划测定，全县有待开发的荒地11万余亩，其中5.9万余亩可垦为耕地，5.6万余亩可开发为园地。这些待开发地多在丘陵岗地，较为集中，万亩以上的有4大片，千亩以上的有8大块，坡度均在15度以下；土壤类型多样，既有四纪红壤，又有紫叶岩风化土壤，土层较厚；并有85％的面积分布在几大灌区范围之内，只要把渠道延伸，即可自流灌溉。无论从经济效益、生态效益上讲，都具有较大的开发价值。不仅有源可开，而且开之有益，何乐而不为呢？！
    近两年来，攸县人的眼睛已经盯到这个上头，开始对荒芜之地实行有计划的开发。常年的冬季农业，只提“三冬”：“冬种、冬造（林）、冬修（水利）”，如今别具一格，加上冬垦（荒），成了“四冬”。县委、县政府对土地开发实行“三不交、两优先、一不变”的优惠政策，规定新开田土五年内不交农业税，不交定购粮，不交集体提留，对积极开垦耕地的村、组、大户，优先供应化肥、柴油，优先给予扶助资金和贷款；在土地所有权不变的原则下，坚持谁开发谁受益，使用权长期不变。各地从实际情况出发，采取不同形式，组织农民垦荒。1988年全县新开发农用地7560亩，今年上半年又开发了2400亩。网岭镇新陂村，有块荒地，常年“水从坡上过，地在坡中荒”，今年刚入春，9个村民组，210户农户战荒坡，造田102亩，其中80亩水田插上了水稻，仅早稻一季收稻谷1.75万公斤。
    土地的荒芜，是个极大的浪费。一面让荒地长期荒着，一面将好地逐步占用，耕地缺乏的矛盾只会加剧。攸县这两年在狠抓“节流”的同时，注重“开源”，这一矛盾就有明显缓解。1988年各项建设只占用耕地357亩，而新开耕地达到7560亩，剔除占用面积，总耕地面积净增了7203亩，一年新开耕地足足补偿了近十年因建设占用的耕地。由此看来，节流、开源，同时并举，双管齐下，是对珍惜每一寸土地这一重大国策的全面理解和正确实施。
    当然，开源，必须讲究科学，要注重综合效益。如果不注重水土保持、乱垦乱挖，则是最大的失误。这样的教训，在我国是深刻的。我们提倡的是在注重水土保持、讲究经济实效的前提下，有计划有步骤地开发荒芜之地，让荒芜之地莫再荒芜下去。
