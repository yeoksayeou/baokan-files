Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 13th.

Japanese prominent politician and Chairman of the Japan External Trade Organization, Yoshio Sakurai, emphasized in an interview with our reporter yesterday that, regardless of any circumstances, the Japan External Trade Organization, as a private organization, will continue economic cooperation and trade exchanges with China.

Yoshio Sakurai mentioned today at the First Diet Members' Hall that during his recent visit to China, despite economic sanctions imposed by Western countries on China, the Japan External Trade Organization sent its largest delegation in history to visit China. This has greatly enhanced mutual understanding between the two sides and will be very beneficial for promoting economic and trade cooperation between the two countries in the future.

Sakurai said that current international relations are developing in a direction of easing tensions, and Japan and China are neighboring countries separated by a narrow strip of water. The prospects for the development of relations between Japan and China are bright.

When talking about his observations from this Beijing trip, Sakurai happily told the reporter that he saw a very stable situation everywhere in Beijing.

He said, we visited Tsinghua University, and the campus was very quiet. We saw students studying peacefully, and we felt very reassured.

Sakurai finally emphasized that Japan and China are like two neighboring families, with an inseparable relationship. No matter what happens between neighbors, we should understand each other and continue to interact in a friendly manner.
