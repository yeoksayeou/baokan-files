	Leaders Lead Teams, Departments Collaborate, and On-Site Breakthroughs: Fuzhou "Diagnoses" Enterprises for Closure and Restructuring

	FUZHOU, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- How to handle enterprises that need to be closed and restructured but are stuck due to unresolved issues with assets, debts, and employee placements? Fuzhou's approach is: leaders lead teams, relevant departments work together, and on-site problem-solving.

	At the beginning of this month, Fuzhou City selected a group of experienced, policy-savvy, and resourceful outstanding Party members and cadres from relevant municipal departments and enterprises to form a team for rectification and deepening reform. Led by municipal leaders, the team visited these enterprises to propagate the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, do ideological and political work among the workers, and help these enterprises clear up debts and coordinate with the supervising departments to handle the placement of enterprise workers.

	Since the supervising departments are all present for the "diagnosis," the "prescriptions" are not only practical but also enforceable, avoiding the blame game. After the decision to close Fuzhou Home Appliance Factory, the city issued a "prescription": Fuzhou Diesel Engine General Factory will take over its assets and recruit 100 of its workers, while Fuzhou Sports Shoes General Factory, Fuzhou Second Light Industry Bureau, and the Labor Bureau will be responsible for absorbing and placing the remaining workers. The factory's loan issues have also been resolved.

	Currently, the first batch of 9 enterprises in Fuzhou has received "prescriptions" after the "diagnosis," and the teams stationed in these enterprises are implementing the municipal leaders' requirements. The second batch of 5 enterprises is undergoing "diagnosis."

    领导带队　部门协同　现场攻坚
    福州为关停并转企业“会诊”
    本报福州12月13日电　记者张铭清报道：对于那些需要关停并转的企业却因资产、债务、人员出路问题解决不了而关不了、停不住、并不成、转不动的“老大难”怎么办？福州的办法是：领导带队，有关部门通力合作，到现场办公，逐个解决问题。
    福州市本月初从市直有关部门和企业抽调一批有经验、懂政策、有办法的优秀党员干部，组成治理整顿、深入改革工作队，由市领导带队，分头到这些企业宣传党的十三届五中全会精神，做好职工思想政治工作，帮助关停并转企业清理好债权债务、协同主管部门做好企业职工的安置工作。
    由于主管部门都在现场“会诊”，所以“处方”不但切实可行，而且都能落实，避免了扯皮推诿。福州家用电器厂被决定关闭后，市里开出了“处方”：由福州柴油机总厂接收其资产，招收其100名职工，市运动鞋总厂、市二轻局、劳动局负责吸收和安置剩余劳力。该厂所欠贷款问题也获得解决。
    目前，福州第一批9家企业经过“会诊”已得到了“处方”，进驻这些企业的工作队正按市领导要求抓落实。第二批5家企业正在“会诊”之中。
