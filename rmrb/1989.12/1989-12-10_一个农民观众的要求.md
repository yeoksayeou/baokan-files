Title: A Farmer's Request

I am a middle-aged farmer who has lived in the countryside for a long time. Like some of my peers and older farmers, I enjoy watching Peking Opera. However, in recent years, it has been impossible to see Peking Opera in the countryside. Whenever there is a break from farming, a few of us Peking Opera enthusiasts take the bus into the city, hoping to watch a performance at a large theater in the city. But they look at us with surprise and say, "You're really from the countryside, aren't you? There's no Peking Opera at this time." Upon further inquiry, it turns out that Peking Opera is not popular in the city, tickets don't sell, and the performances have to be canceled.

As a farmer, I sincerely hope that this art form of Peking Opera will continue to flourish. I believe that under the current circumstances, it would be beneficial for Peking Opera to tour the countryside.

Cultural life in the countryside is quite impoverished, and it is difficult to see Peking Opera, Hebei Clapper Opera, and other traditional folk dramas in a year. Especially during the off-season, farmers are even more eager for theatrical performances. Old opera lovers are particularly eager, often reminiscing about the joy of watching "open-air stage performances" in the past. If city troupes frequently perform in the countryside for farmers, they will definitely be welcomed.

Traditional Peking Opera still has a large audience in the countryside. In addition to traditional plays, it can also take the path of modernizing Peking Opera, which refers to new Peking Opera with modern themes. In the past, there were "White-Haired Girl" and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." Why not adapt "Jia Lin and Qiao Zhen" ("Life"), "The Family of Liu Pu," and "The Legend of the Melon King" into modern Peking Opera?

I suggest that Peking Opera scriptwriters, directors, and actors frequently visit the countryside to experience the lives of contemporary farmers, draw inspiration from it, and create a batch of new scripts. Design a set of new props, stage sets, costumes, character makeup, and martial arts movements, which will definitely interest farmers. In recent years, there have been few new films, TV shows, and dramas with rural themes. Why not let Peking Opera take the lead and break through, and write more modern rural operas?

### 一个农民观众的要求

    一个农民观众的要求
    我是个长期生活在农村的中年农民，跟一些同龄农民和老年农民一样，比较喜欢看京剧，可是近几年在农村根本看不到京剧了。每逢农闲，跟几个京剧爱好者坐车进城，想到城里大剧院看看，人家瞪起眼睛笑我们：“真是乡下人，这时候哪有看京剧的？”细一打听，原来京剧在城里没人看，卖不出票，只好散伙了。
    作为一个农民，我诚恳地希望京剧这朵艺术之花盛开不败。我觉得在当前情况下，京剧下乡演出很有益处。
    农村现在的文化生活比较贫乏，一年里也难看到京剧、评剧和其它古老的民族传统戏剧。特别是农闲季节，农民更盼望有戏剧演出活动，老戏迷更是饥渴难耐，常常在一起重温过去看“野台子戏”的乐趣。如果城里剧团常下乡为农民演出，一定会受到农民欢迎。
    过去的老传统京剧在农村中仍有大量观众。除传统剧目外，还可走京剧现代化道路，这是指新编的现代题材京剧，过去有《白毛女》《智取威虎山》，现在何不把《加林与巧珍》（“人生”）、《柳蒲人家》、《瓜王外传》改编成现代京剧呢？
    建议京剧编剧、导演、演员们常下乡体验一下当代的农民生活，从中汲取营养，创作一批新脚本，设计一套新型道具、场景、服装、人物脸谱、武打动作等，一定会使农民感兴趣。近几年以农村为题材的电影、电视、戏剧新作不多见了，京剧何不打开个突破口，带个好头，多编几出农村现代戏呢？
