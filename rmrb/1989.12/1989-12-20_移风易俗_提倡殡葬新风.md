    Promoting New Funeral Customs and Changing Old Habits

    Leadership Emphasis—
    Changing Funeral Practices in Weixian County

    Lan Yongjin and Xin Daozhuang of the Weixian County Committee, Hebei Province, write: Since 1974, our county has implemented funeral reforms, achieving a 100% cremation rate for 15 consecutive years.

    According to relevant departments, over the past 15 years, 12,500 cubic meters of timber have been saved, 1,500 mu of arable land have been preserved, and 13.3 million yuan in expenses have been reduced.

    The public's funeral practices have also undergone significant changes.

    How were these achievements made possible?

    First, prioritizing public opinion work.
    Through extensive propaganda and education across the county, the widespread feudal superstitions regarding funerals were dispelled, and the idea of holding simple and frugal funerals was promoted.

    Second, leadership emphasis and the establishment of a robust management structure.
    The county established a funeral reform leadership group headed by the deputy county party secretary and deputy county magistrate, with corresponding bodies in each township (town). Regular meetings were held to discuss funeral reform work. Each village established a civic service association, quickly resolving practical issues that arose during the funeral reform process.

    Third, implementing strict regulations and severely punishing violators.
    Since 1974, the county has clearly stipulated the forms and standards for handling funerals, as well as the penalties for violators. Each township and village included funeral reform as a key part of their local regulations. This ensured the implementation of the regulations.

    Fourth, addressing practical issues in funeral reform from the county to the townships.
    To solve the practical issues of implementing cremation, the county promoted the experience of collective funding for cremation.

    Villages with better economic conditions collectively planned and solved the cremation costs. Villages with poorer economic conditions implemented a collective and individual funding system for cremation.

    Each village and the county funeral management office had a hearse, making it convenient to transport the deceased. Each village established a columbarium to solve the problem of land encroachment due to the lack of a place to store ashes. The implementation has been very satisfying to the public.

    Due to the emphasis on leadership, the establishment of a complete system, specific measures, and meticulous work; the persistent implementation, public benefits, and the smooth progress of funeral reform work.

    Simplifying Funerals—
    The Need for Resoluteness to Break Traditional Concepts

    Cluang, the propaganda department of the South Jiang County Committee, writes: On September 25, 1989, a notice was posted on the streets of our county town. It read: My mother passed away due to old age and illness, despite extensive medical treatment. In accordance with the spirit of simplicity in funerals, no gifts will be accepted, and no banquets will be held. Please support and understand. Signed: Wei Xingguo, Wei Xingrong, Wei Xingfu, Wei Xingping, Wei Xingmin. The five Wei brothers work in various departments in the county, including the vegetable and beverage service company, the phosphate fertilizer factory, and the grain and oil management station. They have extensive social connections and many friends and relatives. If they had followed the usual customs, they would have had to host 60-plus banquet tables and accept thousands of yuan in gifts, wasting a lot of money, time, and effort. The five Wei brothers thought: We are all state employees and should lead the way in breaking old customs and establishing new ones. Therefore, they decided to post the aforementioned notice on the streets.

    Later, many friends insisted on sending condolence items totaling over 200 pieces, but all were declined by the Wei brothers. The broad masses of cadres and workers in the county town praised: "The five Wei brothers have set a good example for us!"

    Ding Pengqiu of the Cao Li Township Government, Xufu County, Henan Province, writes: I am my father's only son. Recently, my father unfortunately passed away. In accordance with his wishes, I cremated his body. When I carried the urn into the village, people behind me pointed and said, "What new custom is this, just to save a few yuan," "Ungrateful son, your conscience has been eaten by a dog..." I believe that what I did is right. However, the ridicule and mockery of neighbors over a period of time have caused me inner pain.

    Consequences of Earth Burial—
    Severe Land Waste in Fenghuo Township, Linli County

    Huang Minghong of Fenghuo Township, Linli County, Hunan Province, writes: In August of this year, our township conducted a survey of rural funeral practices since liberation. The results showed that rural earth burials occupy a lot of land, waste a lot, and cause significant harm.

    Land Waste.
    According to measurements of new and old graves, each grave averages 0.067 mu. Since liberation, 9,470 people have died in the township, occupying 634.49 mu of mountainous land, accounting for 1.16% of the township's current forest area.

    If these lands were used to plant trees, the estimated timber volume could reach over 5,000 cubic meters, with a value of over 300 million yuan. The waste caused by building graves is indeed significant.

    Waste of Money.
    First, wood consumption. Assuming one coffin consumes 0.7 cubic meters of wood, since liberation, the township has consumed over 6,000 cubic meters of wood for earth burials, valued at nearly 400 million yuan.

    Second, financial expenditure. Assuming each funeral costs 800 yuan (including food, firecrackers, funeral drums, and hiring pallbearers), over the past 40 years, farmers in the township have spent over 700 million yuan on funerals. What is worrying is that the trend of extravagant funerals is currently on the rise, and this expenditure is increasing.

    Third, corrupting social customs. Earth burials foster a culture of showing off. Some farmers, in order to appear respectable, hold extravagant funerals and end up in debt. Last year, in Yongquan Village, 11 households held funerals, with 8 of them deeply in debt. The most indebted owed over 2,000 yuan. Villager Xin Jichai borrowed 1,000 yuan to hold a funeral for his deceased father. To repay the loan on time, he had to stop his two children from attending school and start farming.

    Currently, some feudal superstitions are also resurfacing in the earth burial trend and becoming more prevalent. Some farmers hold funerals with Taoist rituals, Buddhist ceremonies, and ancestral worship, causing chaos in the village. Such practices seriously corrupt social customs.

    Extravagant Funerals—
    Increasing Burden and Public Discontent

    Zhou Shikai of the First Commercial Bureau Staff School, Chongqing, writes: Recently, I visited a friend in Wujia Town, Rongchang County. As soon as I got off the bus, I saw a funeral pavilion set up by the street. Inside the courtyard, hundreds of people were drinking and making noise, with several mourners going back and forth serving food and drinks. Wujia Town has long had the custom of holding extravagant funerals and weddings. Neighbors and relatives do not care about how well the children took care of their parents while they were alive but are very concerned about how the children handle their parents' affairs after death. Zhang's mother was mistreated in many ways during her life, but when the old woman died in resentment, Zhang did not hesitate to spend over 3,000 yuan to hold a grand funeral.

    Due to the influence of extravagant funerals, many young people in this town are worried about how to handle their parents' funerals when they pass away and where to get the huge expenses from?

    Huang Shoufeng of the Propaganda Department of Qingzhen County Committee, Guizhou Province, writes: At the end of July this year, a deputy director of a certain bureau in our county passed away. On the day of the funeral, 18 large and small official cars followed the funeral procession around the county town, causing traffic congestion for half an hour. Along the way, yellow smoke was released, and firecrackers were constantly set off, with onlookers eagerly watching. The public commented: "These cars are all public property, what a big show!" "The county committee just had a discussion on the image of cadres, what kind of 'image' is this!"

### 移风易俗　提倡殡葬新风

    移风易俗　提倡殡葬新风
    领导重视——
    无极县殡葬观念发生了变化
    河北省无极县委兰永进、信道庄来信：我县从1974年实行殡葬改革以来，连续15年实现火化率百分之百。
    据有关部门计算，15年来，共节约木材12500多立方米，少占耕地1500余亩，节约费用1330余万元。
    群众的丧葬观念也因此发生了显著的变化。
    为何会取得这些成绩呢？
    一、把做好群众思想工作放在第一位。
    通过在全县的宣传教育活动，破除了广大群众在殡葬方面的封建迷信观念，树立了文明、节俭办丧事的思想。
    二、领导重视，建立强有力的管理机构。
    县里成立了由县委副书记、副县长为正副组长的殡葬改革领导小组，各乡（镇）也都成立了相应机构，定期研究殡葬改革工作。各村成立了民事服务会，使得殡葬改革工作中出现的一些实际问题，很快得到解决。
    三、制定严格的规章制度，对违反制度者进行严肃处理。
    1974年以来，县里明确规定了办理丧事的形式和标准，以及对违反制度者的处理办法。各乡村也把殡葬改革列为乡规民约的主要内容。这样，保障了规章制度的落实。
    四、由县到乡镇，层层认真解决殡葬改革工作中的实际问题。
    为了解决实行火化的具体问题，在全县推广集资办火化的经验。
    经济条件较好的村，由集体统一筹划解决火化费用。
    经济条件较差的村，实行集体、个人集资办火化的办法。
    每个村和县殡管所都各备有一辆灵车，负责运送遗体，调用十分方便。村村建立骨灰堂，解决由于骨灰无处存放而蚕食耕地的问题。实行以来，群众非常满意。
    由于领导重视，机构建全，措施具体，工作细致；实行起来，持之有恒，群众受益，殡葬改革工作进行得十分顺利。丧事从简——
    要有冲破传统观念的决心
    四川省南江县委宣传部袁聪来信：1989年9月25日，在我县城各街道上，贴出了一张讣告，上面写着：生母因年老多病，经多方医治无效，于昨日逝世。按照丧事一律从简的精神，不收礼，不请客。望亲朋好友给予支持和谅解。落名是：魏兴国、魏兴荣、魏兴富、魏兴平、魏兴民。魏家5兄弟分别在县城蔬菜饮食服务公司、磷肥厂、粮油管理站等部门工作。他们平时人情交往很广，有许多亲朋好友。母亲病故后，若按常规行事，他们必须请客办酒席60多桌，收受礼金数千元，这样做既浪费大量财物，又要花费很多时间和精力。魏家5兄弟心想：我们都是国家职工，应带头破旧俗，树新风。于是，决定在各街道上贴出上述讣告。
    后来，许多亲友执意送去挽联等物200多件，但都被魏家兄弟谢绝了。县城里广大干部职工称赞说：“魏家5兄弟给咱带了个好头！”
    河南省扶沟县曹里乡政府丁朋秋来信：父亲就我一个儿子。前不久我父亲不幸去世，根据他生前愿望，我对父亲的遗体实行了火葬。当我捧着骨灰盒走进村时，人们就在我背后指戳：“啥新风尚，还不是图省几个钱”，“不孝的东西，良心叫狗吃了”……
    我认为，我这样做是对的。但是，一段时间来街坊邻居不理解的讥讽嘲笑，给我造成了内心的痛苦。土葬后果——
  临澧县烽火乡浪费土地严重
    湖南省临澧县烽火乡黄明洪来信：今年8月，我乡就解放以来农村丧葬情况进行调查的结果表明：农村土葬占地多，浪费大，为害重。
    浪费土地。
    据对新老坟墓抽样实地丈量，平均每座坟墓占地0.067亩。解放40年来，全乡死亡9470人，坟墓占用山地达634.49亩，占全乡现有山林面积的1.16％。
    这些山地若用来栽种林木，林木蓄积量估计可达5000余立方米，产值达300多万元。建造墓地造成的浪费不可谓不小矣。
          浪费钱财。
    一是耗费木材。按制作一副棺材消耗木材0.7立方米计算，解放以来，全乡土葬共耗费木材6000多立方米，价值近400万元。
    二是耗费资金。按每场丧事耗费资金（包括饭菜、鞭炮、打丧鼓、请丧夫等开支）800元计算，40年来，全乡农民办丧事累计耗费资金700余万元。令人担忧的是，眼下大办丧事之风正炽，这种花费还在增大。
    三是败坏社会风气。土葬滋生讲排场之风。部分农民为体面大办丧事而负债累累。去年农泉村11户农户办丧事，有8户债台高筑，最多的欠债2000多元。村民辛继海贷款1000元为病故的父亲办葬事。为了如期偿还贷款，只得令两个孩子停学务农。
    现时，一些封建迷信活动亦在土葬之风中死灰复燃，而且愈演愈烈。一些农民办丧事时请道士做道场，请和尚念经做斋，超度亡人，闹得村里乌烟瘴气，如此这般，严重腐蚀了社会风气。丧事奢办——
      增加负担群众反感
    四川省重庆市第一商业局干部学校周时开来信：最近，我到荣昌县吴家镇访友。一下汽车，便见临街的院坝旁搭着灵棚，坝内人声鼎沸，数百人酒酣耳热，几个披麻带孝的男女来回端菜送酒。吴家镇“红白喜事”奢办之风由来已久，邻里乡亲不过问子女对父母生前赡养的好坏，却十分计较子女对父母的“百年后事”的处置。张某的母亲生前遭受百般虐待，但当老人含恨死去，张某却不惜挥霍3000余元摆阔办丧事。
    由于受丧事奢办风的影响，这个镇不少青年神色忧郁，焦虑着一旦自己的双亲享尽天年，这后事该怎么办，巨额开支从哪里来？
    贵州省清镇县委宣传部黄受锋来信：今年7月底，我县某局一副局长病故。送葬这天，18辆大小公车随送殡队伍浩浩荡荡环绕县城，交通阻塞长达半小时。沿途施放黄烟，鞭炮声声不绝于耳，围观群众争相目睹。群众议论：“这些车都是公家的，场面真不小哩！”“县委刚搞干部形象讨论，这算什么‘形象’！”……
