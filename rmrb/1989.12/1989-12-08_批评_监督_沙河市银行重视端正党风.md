The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Shanhe City, located at the foot of the Taihang Mountains in Hebei Province, has been consecutively named a national financial red flag unit for four years and has been awarded first-class merit citations by the district and city four times.

During a rectification of party and work style conference held in the first two years, a worker representative criticized the bank leadership, saying, "The leadership should address issues such as frequent entertaining of clients, excessive use of vehicles, and infrequent visits to grassroots levels." That evening, the bank's party committee held an expanded meeting and promptly issued several regulations to rectify the leadership style. The next day, members of the party committee led by example in self-criticism and then announced the decisions of the expanded meeting to all representatives, welcoming everyone to supervise the implementation. Seeing this, the representatives actively spoke up, proposing 23 suggestions for improving various improper practices within the bank.

The bank's party committee not only addressed and publicly responded to these criticisms and suggestions but also established public notice boards for administrative and business affairs, disclosing information about recruitment, promotion of cadres, evaluation of professional titles, and credit issues to the public.

Members of the party committee of the Shanhe City branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank always put matters on the table and never engage in backdoor dealings. In March 1989, the bank president Guo Zhangcheng attended a meeting in the province, leaving the work to a deputy bank president. Due to the high demand for loans at the beginning of the year, there was a problem with the large amount of loans issued. When Guo returned from the meeting, he held the provincial bank's document on reducing loans and credit quotas, saw the problems in the bank's lending, and discussed the issues with the deputy bank president. At the bank's work meeting, he criticized his own work style of not promptly conveying the higher-level spirit while also seriously pointing out the deputy bank president's lax control over loans.

To continuously carry out criticism and self-criticism, the bank's party committee restored the weekly party day activity and added a bi-monthly heart-to-heart communication meeting and a monthly "self-exposure" meeting.

    批评·监督
    ——沙河市银行重视端正党风
    戴建英　李玉堂
    位于太行山下的河北省沙河市中国工商银行，连续四年被评为全国金融红旗单位，四次被地、市荣记一等功。
    在头两年的一次端正党风行风职代会上，有位职工代表对行领导提出批评：“行领导应解决陪客吃喝多，出门坐车多，下基层办公少这样一类问题。”当天晚上，行党组召开扩大会议，连夜作出了端正领导作风的若干规定。第二天，行党组成员带头作自我检查，然后向全体代表宣布了党组扩大会决定，并欢迎大家监督落实。代表们见此情景，都积极发言，就银行内一些不正之风提出了改进意见二十三条。
    银行党组对这些批评和建议不仅逐条落实、公开答复，还设立了政务、业务公开栏，向群众公开了招工、干部晋级、评定职称和信贷等情况。
    工商银行沙河市分行党组成员遇事总是摆到桌面上，从不在背后打横炮。一九八九年三月，行长郭章成到省里开会，把工作交给了一位副行长。由于年初要求贷款的用户很多，出现了贷款数较大的问题。郭章成开会回来，手里拿着省行要求压缩贷款和信贷包干的文件，看到本行放贷中存在的问题，就找那位副行长交换意见。在行务会上，他检查自己没有及时传达上级精神的工作作风的同时，又严肃指出了副行长控制贷款不严问题。
    为了经常不断地开展批评和自我批评，银行党组在恢复每星期一次党日活动制的同时，还增加了每半月一次交心通气会和每月一次“自我曝光会”。
