Early winter, the cold air bites, but inside the East Hall of the Labor People's Cultural Palace, the atmosphere is lively. The calligraphy and painting exhibition by Zhao Peng, Hong Hai, and De Long has attracted a large number of enthusiastic viewers.

Inside the exhibition hall, there are 99 pieces of calligraphy and painting works by the three authors, each with different forms, styles, and artistic pursuits. Some are bold and expansive, others are fresh and elegant, some are dignified, some are carefree, some are like a powerful and majestic military anthem, and others are like a soft, lyrical melody.

These three authors, who are neither professional artists nor famous masters, are young friends in the military. They all enlisted as soldiers in their teens and are currently working in the military in jobs that have little to do with calligraphy and painting. Yet, they have entered the realm of calligraphy and painting art and achieved such results, which is no easy feat.

Their common trait is that they all loved calligraphy and painting since childhood, have some artistic talent and intelligence, and regardless of how their work changes, they have never slackened their relentless pursuit of calligraphy and painting. This has almost become an indispensable part of their lives. In their busy work schedules, they always diligently study and repeatedly practice ancient and modern calligraphy and painting by famous masters.

Copying famous calligraphy and painting works has been proven to be an effective method for learning calligraphy and painting. However, copying and creating are two different things. Copying involves learning common and rule-based elements and is a preparation for creation; creation emphasizes personal feelings and interests based on mastering the "rules." Being able to recognize the connection and difference between the two and correctly handle them is often a measure of whether a person learning calligraphy and painting has insight and potential for development.

The works of Zhao Peng and the other two not only show a foundation in tradition but also reflect a new era's style and individual expression, which is very valuable.

    功夫不负有心人
    ——“赵鹏洪海德龙书画展”观后
    夏湘平
    初冬，寒气袭人，劳动人民文化宫东配殿内却气氛热烈，赵鹏、洪海、德龙书画展迎来了大批兴致勃勃的观众。
    展厅里，陈列着三位作者九十九件不同形式、风格和追求的书画作品。
    他们以娴熟的笔墨、别致的章法，表现了多姿多采的情趣：有的气势开放、雄浑豪放，有的清新淡雅、平和宁静，有的端庄，有的潇洒，有的像高唱一首威武雄壮的军歌，有的像低哼一支轻柔抒情的小曲。
    这三位既非专业又非名家的作者，是解放军中三位年轻的朋友，他们都是十几岁参军当战士，目前都在部队从事着与书画本无多大关联的工作，居然走进了书画艺术殿堂，取得了如此成绩，确非易事。
    他们共同的特点：都是自幼酷爱书画，都有一定的艺术天赋和聪颖，无论工作怎样变动，都没有放松对书画执著的追求，这几乎成了他们各自生活中不可缺少的一部分。在繁忙的工作之余，总是孜孜不倦地潜心钻研，长期反复地练习古今名人书画。
    临摹书画名迹早被事实证明是学习书画行之有效的方法。但临摹和创作毕竟是两回事，临摹是学习共性和带规律性的东西，是创作前的准备；创作则强调在掌握
  “法”的基础上的个人感受、意趣的发挥。能够认清两者既有联系又有区别，并能正确对待，常常是衡量一个学习书画的人有没有悟性、有没有发展的标志。
    赵鹏等三人的作品，既可看出有传统作依据，又体现了新的时代风貌和个性的流露，这是非常可贵的。
