	Japanese Upper House Passes Bill to Abolish Consumption Tax

	Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 11 – (Reporter Jiang Yuzhe) The Japanese Upper House today passed a bill proposed by opposition party members to abolish the consumption tax with 130 votes in favor.

	This is the first time in Japan's post-war history that the Upper House has passed a bill proposed by the opposition.

	The consumption tax bill was pushed through the Lower House by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) at the end of last year using its majority seats and came into effect on April 1 of this year. After its implementation, it faced strong opposition from the Japanese people and led to the LDP's defeat in the Upper House elections in July, losing its majority.

	Prime Minister Kaifu stated after the Upper House passed the bill to abolish the consumption tax, "This is a serious situation."

	The bill passed by the Upper House still needs to be submitted to the Lower House for deliberation and passage before it can take effect.

	Since the LDP holds a majority in the Lower House, it is expected that the bill will not pass, and will become null and void.

	Local opinion believes that the passage of this bill in the Upper House shows that the opposition parties can unite to oppose the ruling party on certain issues. The LDP will face more challenges in its future governance.

    日本参议院通过废除消费税法案
    新华社东京12月11日电  （记者蒋豫浙）日本参议院今天以130票赞成，通过了在野党议员提出的废除消费税法案。
    这是日本战后首次在参议院通过在野党提出的法案。
    消费税法案是去年年底执政的自民党以其在众议院的多数议席强行通过的，并于今年4月1日开始实施。该法案实施后遭到日本国民的强烈反对，并使自民党在今年7月的参议院选举中惨遭失败，失去占多数席位的优势。
    海部首相在参议院通过废除消费税法案后说，“这是一个严重的事态”。
    参议院通过的法案还需要递交众议院审议通过后才能成立。
    由于自民党在众议院占有多数议席，预计该法案不会在众议院获得通过，将成为废案。
    此间舆论认为，该法案在参议院通过表明在野党势力在某些问题上能够团结一致反对执政党。自民党在今后的执政过程中将会遇到更多难题。
