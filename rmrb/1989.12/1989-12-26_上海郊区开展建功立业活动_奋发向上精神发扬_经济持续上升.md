Shanghai Suburbs Launch "Build Achievement and Prosper" Campaign
Spirit of Striving Forward Promoted, Economy Continues to Rise

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai -- Reporter Zhang Shihong reports: How to carry out spiritual civilization construction in rural areas? How to infuse ideological and political work into economic and social life? This is an important task facing the broad masses of rural cadres. The 10 counties in Shanghai's suburbs have made remarkable achievements in launching the "Build Achievement and Prosper" campaign in rural areas over the past three years, providing successful experiences for solving this problem and achieving new breakthroughs in rural ideological and political work.

	This campaign was initiated by Nanhui County in 1986. In July 1985, the Party Committee of Nanhui Waterproof Coating Factory launched the "Monthly Evaluation of 10 Good Deeds" activity throughout the factory, vigorously promoting the addition of glory to the enterprise and contributions to the hometown. Through layer-by-layer evaluations, 10 good deeds at the factory level were selected each month and publicly announced, with material rewards given to the relevant individuals. The activity, after a few months, had a good effect, and the factory saw a surge in the creation of excellence, striving for progress, and a "micro-climate." At that time, the county committee was considering how to carry out ideological and political work in the new era, and this factory's experience gave them great inspiration. They felt that through the "Merit Competition" activity to strengthen the effect of "incentives," it was feasible in rural areas. Therefore, the county committee decided to take the four "selfs" (self-education, self-motivation, self-renunciation, self-improvement) as the starting point, and to select "100 Good Deeds" as the content, to launch the "I Add Glory to the Party Flag, I Add Glory to Nanhui" activity throughout the county. Starting from 1987, under the advocacy of the Municipal Agricultural Commission, the mass self-education activity of contributing to reform and building achievements for the hometown was launched in various counties, towns, and villages. Chongming County launched the "Love the Island, Build the Island" activity, Chuansha County's slogan was "Love China, Love Chuansha," and Songjiang County proposed "Create a New Business for Reform, Build a Civilized Homeland." These counties' activities also achieved breakthroughs: party style and social atmosphere improved, the spirit of striving forward was promoted, and the economy continued to rise. Four counties' fiscal revenues ranked among the top 10 in the country. Foreign trade exports increased by an average of 40% each year over the past three years.

	One of the characteristics of Shanghai suburbs launching this activity is that the mobilization is extensive, with government agencies, schools, enterprises, and village committees all participating in this activity. In the past two years, Chuansha County has selected 448 county-level meritorious individuals, more than 2,000 town-level meritorious individuals, and more than 10,000 grassroots-level meritorious individuals. The number of meritorious individuals this year will be even greater, including outstanding factory managers, engineers, contract holders, doctors, teachers, students, and individual business owners. This activity has united the people of the entire county, and everyone has contributed a patriotic heart to the construction of their hometown.

	Another characteristic is that this activity is combined with economic construction, embodying the guiding ideology of "one center, two basic points," and integrating spiritual civilization construction with material civilization construction. Enterprises use patriotism as a driving force to launch the "Create Brands, Increase Benefits" competition, proposing many rationalization suggestions; rural areas aim to achieve high yields and ensure urban supply as competition targets; scientific and technological personnel strive to produce the best scientific and technological achievements; teachers propose the goal of "producing results and talents." The annual evaluation mainly looks at performance.

	The third characteristic is the gradual establishment of a complete set of standards and assessment systems to ensure that the merit competition can be sustained. Chongming County decomposes various indicators to each unit, implements hierarchical responsibility, item-by-item inspection, unified assessment, and percentage-based rewards, making the activity tend towards institutionalization. At the same time, stricter requirements are proposed for party members, especially party cadres. The experience of Chongming County is being promoted in various counties.

	Shanghai municipal leaders believe that the "Build Achievement and Prosper" campaign, starting from rural realities, combines each individual's pursuit of life, each department's struggle goals, and each region's development plans with the common ideal of revitalizing China, thus forming a joint force to create a new atmosphere, and creating a good environment for the construction of the two civilizations.

    上海郊区开展建功立业活动
    奋发向上精神发扬　经济持续上升
    本报上海电　记者章世鸿报道：农村的精神文明建设如何进行？思想政治工作如何渗透到经济和社会生活中去？这是摆在广大农村工作干部面前的一项重要课题。上海郊区10县近三年来在农村开展建功立业活动取得显著成就，为解决这个课题提供了成功的经验，在农村思想政治工作上取得新突破。
    这项活动是由南汇县在1986年带头开展的。1985年7月，南汇防水涂料厂党总支在全厂开展“月评10件好事”活动，大力宣传为企业添光彩，为家乡作贡献；通过层层评比，每月选出厂级好事10件，并张榜公布，还给予有关人员物质奖励。活动开展几个月，效果很好，全厂出现了创优争先、奋发进取的“小气候”。当时，县委正在思考新时期的思想政治工作如何做，这个厂的经验给他们以很大启示。他们感到，通过开展“立功竞赛”活动来强化“激励”的效果，在农村是可行的。于是，县委决定以四个“自我”（自我教育、自我激励、自我扬弃、自我提高）为基点，以评选“百件好事”为内容，在全县开展“我为党旗增光辉，我为南汇添光彩”活动。从1987年开始，在市农委倡导下，为改革献计出力，为家乡建功立业的群众性自我教育活动，便在各县、乡、村普遍开展。崇明县开展“爱岛、建岛活动”，川沙县的口号是“爱我中华，爱我川沙”，松江县提出“创改革新业，建文明家园”。这些县的活动也取得突破：党风社会风气转变，奋发向上精神发扬，经济持续上升。有4个县财政收入列入全国10个先进县的行列。外贸出口3年来平均每年递增40％。
    上海郊区开展这项活动的特点之一是，动员面广，机关、学校、企业、村民小组都投入这个活动之中。前两年，川沙县共评选出县级立功人员448名，乡镇局级立功人员2000多名，基层单位立功人员万名以上，今年立功人员人数将更多，这些人中包括优秀厂长经理、工程师、承包大户、医生、教师、学生、个体户。这场活动把全县人民凝聚起来，大家都为本乡本土建设奉献一颗爱国之心。
    特点之二是这个活动同经济建设相结合，体现“一个中心、两个基本点”的指导思想，把精神文明建设与物质文明建设熔为一炉。各企业以爱国主义为动力，开展“创名牌、增效益”竞赛，提出许多合理化建议；农村以夺高产、保证城市供应为竞赛目标；科技人员力争拿出最佳科技成果；教师则提出“出成果，出人才”的奋斗目标。每年一次的评比，主要看实绩。
    特点之三是逐步建立完整的达标、考核体系，保证立功竞赛持久开展下去。崇明县把各项指标分解到各单位，实行分级负责，分条检查，统一考核，百分计奖，使活动趋向制度化。同时对党员，特别是党员干部提出更加严格的要求。崇明县的经验正在各县推广。
    上海市领导认为，建功立业活动从农村实际出发，把每个人的人生追求，每个部门的奋斗目标，每个地区的发展计划，同振兴中华的共同理想结合起来，从而形成合力汇成新风，为两个文明建设创造良好的氛围。
