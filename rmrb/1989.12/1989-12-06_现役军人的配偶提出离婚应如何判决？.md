	The wife of a soldier in our unit has filed a lawsuit with the local people's court seeking a divorce from her husband. The soldier does not agree, and the judicial personnel from the court have come to the unit to do some work, but the soldier still does not agree to the divorce. Article 26 of the Marriage Law states: "The spouse of an active-duty soldier who requests a divorce must obtain the soldier's consent." Please ask: Can this case be ruled in favor of the divorce?

	The Marriage Law's Article 26 is a substantive legal protection for the marriages of soldiers, a special measure adopted by our country's laws to protect the marriages and families of soldiers, differing from ordinary divorce cases.

	The reason the Marriage Law has such a provision is that the People's Liberation Army is tasked with the important mission of consolidating national defense, safeguarding the motherland, and protecting the peaceful labor of the people. They are far from their homes, constantly fighting on the front lines to defend the motherland. Protecting the marriages and families of active-duty soldiers through the law will reduce their worries, allowing them to serve with peace of mind; it will ensure the smooth implementation of conscription and mobilization work; and it will further strengthen military-civilian relations. This is an indispensable condition for building an iron wall.

	Active-duty soldiers refer to male and female soldiers in the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police who have military status and are currently serving. This does not include demobilized soldiers, discharged soldiers, transferred soldiers, or workers in military units who do not have military status.

	The legal protection for the divorces of active-duty soldiers refers to cases where the spouse of an active-duty soldier, who is not a soldier, initiates a divorce. Such cases should be handled according to the provisions of Article 26 of the Marriage Law. If the non-military spouse initiates the divorce and the military spouse does not agree, the non-military spouse should be educated to cherish the marital relationship with the soldier, and efforts should be made to reconcile and make amends, or the divorce should not be granted. For cases where the marital relationship has indeed broken down and efforts to reconcile have failed, making it impossible to continue the marital relationship, the divorce should be granted through the political organs at the regiment level or above in the soldier's unit, after conducting ideological work with the soldier.

	If the soldier initiates the divorce with the non-military spouse, or if both spouses are active-duty soldiers seeking a divorce, Article 26 of the Marriage Law does not apply. Such cases should be handled according to the provisions of Article 25 of the Marriage Law, which states: "When the people's courts handle divorce cases, they should mediate; if the marital relationship has indeed broken down and mediation fails, the divorce should be granted." When active-duty soldiers apply for a divorce, according to the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army's "Temporary Provisions on the Implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China in the Military," they "should adopt a serious and cautious attitude, not violate laws and regulations, and not damage morality. Applicants for divorce must obtain the approval of the political organs at the regiment level or above in their unit and provide certification before they can go to the local marriage registration authorities to register the divorce or file a divorce lawsuit with the people's court."

	For the case you mentioned, where the non-military wife initiates a divorce from the active-duty soldier husband, if the plaintiff's reasons are not sufficient, the local marriage registration authorities or the people's court should make efforts to reconcile them. If their marital relationship has indeed broken down and efforts to reconcile have failed, the people's court should rule in favor of the divorce according to the Marriage Law. If the court does not rule in favor of the divorce, it will be very painful for both spouses, not only failing to reduce the soldier's worries and allow them to serve with peace of mind, but also affecting the soldier's work, life, and combat morale.

    现役军人的配偶提出离婚应如何判决？
    编辑同志
    我部一战士的妻子向当地人民法院提出与丈夫离婚的诉讼。这个战士不同意，法院的审判人员亲自来部队做工作，该战士再次表示不同意离婚。婚姻法第26条规定：“现役军人的配偶要求离婚，须得军人同意”。请问：这起案件能否判决离婚呢？
            辽宁凤城县驻军某部　庞玉双
    庞玉双同志：
    婚姻法第26条是对军人婚姻的特殊法律保护的实体性规定，是我国法律对军人的婚姻家庭，采取同普通离婚案件不同的、专门的保护措施。
    婚姻法之所以这样规定，意义在于解放军担负着巩固国防，保卫祖国、保卫人民和平劳动的重要任务。他们远离家乡，常年战斗在保卫祖国的岗位上。依法保护现役军让的婚姻家庭，军人就会减少后顾之忧，安心服役；就能保证征兵动员工作的顺利进行；就能进一步密切军民关系。这是建设钢铁长城必不可少的条件。
    现役军人，是指有军籍、正在服役的解放军和武警部队的男女军人，不包括退伍军人、复员军人、转业军人和军事单位内没有军籍的职工。
    对现役军人离婚的法律保护，是指现役军人的配偶不是军人而提出离婚的，按婚姻法第26条的规定处理。非军人一方提出离婚，军人一方不同意的，应教育非军一方珍惜与军人的夫妻感情，尽量调解和好，或者判决不准离婚。对于夫妻感情确已破裂，经耐心细致地做和好工作无效，已经不能继续维持夫妻关系的，应通过军人所在部队团以上的政治机关，做军人的思想工作，也可准予离婚。
    军人一方向非军人一方提出离婚，或者双方都是现役军人的离婚，不适用婚姻法26条的规定，应按婚姻法第25条的规定办理，即：“人民法院审理离婚案件，应当进行调解；如感情确已破裂，调解无效，应准予离婚。”现役军人提出离婚，根据解放军总政治部《关于军队贯彻执行〈中华人民共和国婚姻法〉的暂行规定》，“应持严肃慎重的态度，要不违反法令，不败坏道德。申请离婚者，须经所在团以上政治机关同意，并出具证明，方可到地方婚姻登记机关登记离婚，或向人民法院提出离婚诉讼。”
    你所提非军人妻子向现役军人丈夫提出离婚的问题，如果原告理由不充分，地方婚姻登记机关或者人民法院，应尽量做他们的和好工作。如果他们的夫妻关系确已破裂，经做和好工作无效，人民法院应依婚姻法判决准予离婚。如果法院不判决他们离婚，对夫妻双方都会是很痛苦的，不仅不会达到减少军人的后顾之忧，安心服役，而且会影响军人的工作、生活和战斗情绪。
