The obverse of each coin features a panoramic view of the Dacheng Hall in Qufu.

The second group includes 3 coins: one 1-ounce gold coin, one 1-ounce silver coin, and one 1-ounce platinum coin. The obverse of each coin features the national emblem and a peony flower pattern. The reverse features a design from the work of Zhang Daqian, a distinguished modern Chinese painter, titled "Fine Horse."

The Gengwu (Horse) Year commemorative coins are minted by the Shanghai Mint and the Shenyang Mint, with the China Gold Coin Corporation serving as the general agent. The overseas general agents are the Beijing Coin Company in Hong Kong and the China Numismatic Corporation Limited.

Since the issuance of the Chinese Zodiac commemorative coins in 1980, these coins have become highly sought-after collectibles due to their unique themes, exquisite designs, and superior minting quality. They have won the China Hundred Flowers Gold Cup Award and the International Best Silver Coin Award. The issuance of these commemorative coins marks the 10th set in the Zodiac series.
