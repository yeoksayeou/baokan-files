The proliferation of bourgeois liberalization in the arts has severely impacted the field of political propaganda posters. In recent years, the role of propaganda posters in promoting the Party's policies has been dismissed as "empty sloganeering." The glorification of hard work and frugality has been ridiculed as "poverty transition." Promoting legal awareness and socialist spiritual civilization has been deemed unnecessary, with some even fundamentally denying the value of propaganda posters. The propaganda posters that once adorned major intersections in cities across the country have been replaced by various commercial advertisements. In some cities, propaganda posters are even banned from streets and shop windows under the pretext of "spoiling the cityscape." With no future in sight, most propaganda artists have been forced to change careers.

As an art form, propaganda posters have their own unique value and functions that cannot be replaced by other types of art. For example, in 1950, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House published a propaganda poster titled "We Love Peace," featuring two adorable children holding a dove. On the Korean front, this poster was ubiquitous. Soldiers would take an oath in front of it before going into battle, vowing to defend their homeland and its children. The soldiers of the Volunteer Army, through this poster, connected their pure feelings with their motherland. In his later years, Mr. Xu Beihong, despite his frail health, created the anti-American aid Korea propaganda poster "We Will Give the War Mongers a More Severe Lesson and Warning" under extremely difficult conditions, which had a very positive effect.

Propaganda posters are a young, combative, and populist art form with unique expression methods. During festivals, they can enhance the festive atmosphere; during wartime, they can boost morale. In factories, they can inspire workers to produce high-quality goods and achieve high yields; in schools, they can educate children to "study hard and make progress every day." They can be made into portraits of famous scientists, patriots, and revolutionary martyrs, educating young people about patriotism and revolutionary traditions. Their functions are multifaceted and indispensable in life. Now is the perfect time for propaganda posters to regain their vitality.

Firstly, we should elevate the status of propaganda posters and gain support from the media and public opinion. Secondly, we should focus on cultivating the propaganda poster creation team.

    让宣传画恢复生机
    文艺界资产阶级自由化泛滥已久，在美术领域里受灾最重的是政治宣传画。近年来，宣传画宣传党的方针政策被说成是“空喊教条”；宣传艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的光荣传统被讥讽为“穷过渡”；宣传法制和社会主义精神文明被认为多此一举，有人甚至从根本上否定宣传画。原来在全国各城市主要街口绘制的宣传画早已被形形色色的商业广告代替。在某些城市的街头和商店橱窗里，竟然不准张贴宣传画，理由是“有碍市容”。由于宣传画没有出路，大多数宣传画家已被迫改行。
    宣传画作为一种艺术，自然有其存在的价值和其它画种所无法代替的作用。譬如，一九五○年，人民美术出版社出版过一张宣传画《我们热爱和平》，是怀抱鸽子的两个可爱的儿童。在朝鲜前线，到处可以看到它，战士们在出征前，在这幅画前宣誓，为保卫祖国、保卫祖国的花朵而战。志愿军战士通过这幅画，把自己纯真的感情和祖国紧紧地联系在一起。徐悲鸿先生晚年体弱多病，在十分艰苦的条件下，亲手创作了抗美援朝宣传画《还要给战争贩子以更严重的打击和教训》，起到了非常好的作用。
    宣传画是一个既年轻又具有战斗性和群众性的画种，有着独特的表现手法。节日，它可以增加欢乐喜庆的气氛；战时，它可以鼓舞人们的斗志。在车间，它可以激发工人们创优质、夺高产的生产热情；在学校，它教育孩子们“好好学习，天天向上”。它可以制成古今科技名人、爱国英雄、革命烈士挂图，向青少年进行爱国主义和革命传统教育。它的功能是多方面的，是生活中不可缺少的。现在正是宣传画恢复生机的最好时刻。
    首先应提高宣传画的地位，获得报刊、舆论的支持。其次，应重视宣传画创作队伍的培养。
