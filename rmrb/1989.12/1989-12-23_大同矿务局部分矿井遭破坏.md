The Datong Mining Bureau's 15 mines have 8 that have been damaged by local small mines.

The Yanzi Mountain Mine, built with 358.62 million yuan of state investment, started production this year but has been attacked and interfered with by 56 surrounding small mines, causing serious damage to the mine's working faces and reducing annual production capacity by 800,000 tons.

The Tongjiabang Mine, a large mine with an annual capacity of 3 million tons, has been disrupted by small mines in recent years, causing 8 teams' working faces to exceed the limit for methane and carbon dioxide, and making 17 million tons of recoverable coal unable to be mined normally.

The Sitaigou Mine, with a designed annual capacity of 5 million tons, is now surrounded by 45 small mines. It is estimated that the loss of reserves is as high as 16 million tons, accounting for more than 17% of the total reserves.

At the same time, the accumulated water, fires, and harmful gases in the mined-out areas of the small mines are seriously affecting the current construction and the safe production of the northern coalfield.

    大同矿务局部分矿井遭破坏
    大同矿务局现有的15个矿，有8个矿井遭到地方小窑的破坏。
    国家投资35862万元建设的大同矿务局燕子山矿，今年刚投产，就遭到周围56座小窑的袭击和干扰，使矿区的工作面遭到严重破坏，每年矿井生产能力下降80万吨。
    大同矿务局同家梁矿是个年产300万吨的大型矿井，近几年来被小窑搅得不安宁，造成8个队工作面沼气、二氧化碳超限，1700万吨可采煤无法正常开采。
    年设计能力为500万吨的大同矿务局四台沟矿，如今正被45座小窑团团围住。估计储量损失高达1600万吨，占总储量的17％以上。
    同时，小窑采空区的积水、发火和有害气体等还严重影响着眼前的施工和北部煤田的安全生产。
