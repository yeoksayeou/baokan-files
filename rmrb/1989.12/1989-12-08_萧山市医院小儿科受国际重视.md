The pediatric department of Xiaoshan City Hospital has recently gained international attention. The newborn monitoring work of the department has been selected by the American HOPE Foundation to be featured in a documentary to be introduced to the world.

The pediatric department of Xiaoshan City People's Hospital officially opened in January 1984. The department has 30 beds and is staffed by 10 doctors and 12 nurses. Despite the small size of the department, the medical and nursing staff have not lowered their standards but have continuously improved their professional skills. By this year, all staff members have undergone training and further education in large hospitals in Hangzhou and Shanghai. Focusing on the weak link in the treatment and care of newborns, they have organized specialized lectures on newborns and provided systematic guidance to medical and nursing staff. Under the guidance of the American HOPE Foundation, they have carried out newborn monitoring training, and three doctors from the department have obtained the qualification of local instructors from the HOPE Foundation after passing the assessment. This year, they treated 29 premature infants, the smallest of whom was only 30 weeks and 1 day old, weighing just 1,100 grams, and all survived. They successfully rescued 49 newborns, with a success rate of 89.8%, and were designated by the HOPE Foundation as one of the newborn monitoring training bases. This is the only county-level hospital pediatric department among the four newborn monitoring training bases established by the foundation in China.

    萧山市医院小儿科受国际重视
    据新华社杭州十二月六日电  （记者唐庆忠、实习生程为民）一个县级医院小儿科——浙江萧山市人民医院小儿科的新生儿监护工作最近被美国HOPE基金会看中，摄制纪录片向全世界介绍。
    萧山市人民医院小儿科于一九八四年一月正式开放，全科共设床位三十张，配备十名医师、十二名护士。全科医生、护士并不因科室小而降低标准，而是不断提高业务素质。到今年为止全科人员已全部外出到杭州、上海的大医院进修、培训过。针对新生儿治疗护理这一薄弱环节，他们开办新生儿专题讲座，对医护人员进行系统辅导。在美国HOPE基金会的指导下开展新生儿监护培训，这个科的三位医生通过考核获得HOPE基金会地方指导老师资格。今年收治早产儿二十九名，其中最小的只有三十周零一天，体重仅一千一百克，全部成活。新生儿抢救四十九例，成功率达百分之八十九点八，被HOPE基金会定为新生儿监护培训点之一。这是这个基金会在中国设立的四个新生儿监护培训点中唯一一个县级医院的小儿科。
