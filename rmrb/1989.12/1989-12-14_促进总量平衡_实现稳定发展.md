The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to continue to reduce the scale of investment, control the rapid growth of consumption demand, and adhere to the policy of tightening fiscal and credit policies to address the imbalance between social total demand and social total supply. This is a major issue related to whether the rectification can achieve its goals and whether the national economy can turn around.

Balance leads to stability. Trees are easy to topple, and economic activities are the same. If the total amount of social demand and supply is imbalanced, the entire national economy will be unstable and may even fall into serious difficulties. Since the second half of 1984, due to the failure to take decisive measures to address the problems of economic overheating, excessive currency issuance, and excessive national income distribution, the imbalance in the total amount of the national economy has become quite serious. From 1984 to 1988, the national income increased by 70%, while the total social fixed asset investment increased by 214%, and the growth rate of urban and rural residents' monetary income reached 200%. The dual expansion of investment demand and consumption demand has led to various difficulties in the current economic life.

Historical experience tells us that if we do not take controlling social total demand as the primary task and strive to increase effective supply to achieve a balance between total supply and demand, then we cannot achieve economic structural adjustment, rectify economic order, curb inflation, or make the national economy develop in a sustained, stable, and coordinated manner.

Emphasizing overall balance, will it lead to stagflation and exacerbate supply shortages? Currently, the market is sluggish, enterprises are generally complaining about a lack of funds, and the rate of industrial production development has dropped sharply in recent months. In this situation, should we still focus on overall balance and adhere to the double-tight policy? This is a concern for everyone.

Undoubtedly, we must pay great attention to these new situations. At the same time, we must conduct in-depth research and specific analysis of them. The so-called market sluggishness is a local phenomenon and not a general stagnation of all commodities. It is only prominent in a few household appliances that people used to rush to buy and some light textile products, while energy and raw materials are still basically in short supply. More importantly, most of this sluggishness is not caused by oversupply but by various other factors. There are the effects of the double-tight policy, the failure to properly implement the rectification measures, the failure to truly implement the policy of tilting, and the psychological "rebound" of consumers after rushing to buy, among other factors. All of these require us to make timely adjustments. But one fundamental fact has not changed, that is, total demand is still greater than total supply. We must not be misled by some phenomena and relax the implementation of the double-tight policy. Controlling the total amount and adjusting the structure are complementary. The task of adjusting the structure is undoubtedly very urgent. However, facts have repeatedly proven that in a situation of serious total imbalance, it is difficult to change the irrational structure, and it may even continue to develop. Moreover, adjusting the product structure, especially the industrial structure, is a very arduous and complex task that is difficult to accomplish in the short term. Therefore, during the rectification period, we must firmly grasp the control of the total amount as the "nose ring" and use it to drive structural adjustment or create conditions for further structural adjustment.

It is very important for leaders at all levels and all enterprises to understand the above points. Do not place hopes on the "lifting" of the double-tight policy, nor should you change tactics to engage in "rushing and leaping" or prepare to "endure" for a while and then engage in "rushing and leaping." Instead, truly turn the corner, seriously consider how to do a good job in economic work under the condition of adhering to the double-tight policy, and take practical measures to implement it. The central authorities have repeatedly emphasized the need to tighten our belts for a few years, and this is also an essential part of tightening our belts.

    促进总量平衡　实现稳定发展
    本报评论员
    党的十三届五中全会提出，继续压缩投资规模，控制消费需求过快增长，坚持执行紧缩财政和信贷方针，以便解决社会总需求和社会总供给不平衡问题。这是关系治理整顿能否达到目标，整个国民经济能否出现转机的重大问题。
    平衡才能稳定。树倾容易倒，经济活动也同此理。社会需求和社会供给总量失衡，整个国民经济必然动荡不定，甚至陷于严重困境。1984年下半年以来，由于对于经济过热、货币发行过多、国民收入超分配等问题，未能采取果断措施及时加以解决，国民经济中总量不平衡的状况已相当严重。1984年至1988年，国民总收入增长70％，而社会固定资产投资增长214％，城乡居民货币收入增长率高达200％。投资需求和消费需求的双膨胀，导致了目前经济生活中的种种困难。
    历史经验告诉我们，如果不把控制社会总需求当作首要任务来抓，并努力增加有效供给，以求得供需总量平衡，那么既不能做到调整经济结构、治理经济秩序，遏制通货膨胀也很难奏效，国民经济难以走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。
    强调总量平衡，会不会引起生产滞胀，加剧供给不足？目前，市场出现疲软，企业普遍呼喊资金不足，近几个月工业生产发展速度下降过猛，在这种情况下，是否还应该着眼总量平衡，坚持双紧方针？这是当前人们关心的问题。
    毫无疑问，我们必须十分注意这些新的情况。但同时必须对它们进行深入研究和具体分析。所谓市场疲软只是局部现象，并不是所有商品的全面滞销，只有在几种过去人们抢购的家用电器和部分轻纺产品上表现突出，而能源、原材料等仍基本处于短缺状态。更重要的是，这种疲软大多数并不是因为供过于求造成的，而是由于其他种种因素形成的。这里面有双紧方针的成效，也有治理整顿措施未能很好衔接，倾斜政策未能真正落实的问题，还有消费者抢购之后的心理“反弹”等等因素。这都需要我们及时作出调整。但有一个基本事实没有改变，那就是总需求依然大于总供给，我们切不可被一些现象所迷惑，放松了双紧方针的贯彻执行。控制总量，调整结构，这两者是相辅相成的。调整结构的任务无疑也是十分迫切的。但是，事实反复证明，在总量严重失衡的情况下，结构不合理的状况不但难以改变，甚至还会继续发展。况且，产品结构特别是产业结构的调整是相当艰巨复杂的事情，短期难以办好。因此，在治理整顿期间，必须坚定地抓住控制总量这个“牛鼻子”，并以此带动结构调整或为进一步调整结构创造条件。
    明确上述道理，对于各级领导、各个企业来说十分重要。不要把期望寄托在双紧方针的“解除”上，更不要变法儿搞“大干快上”或准备“忍”一阵子再搞“大干快上”，而是真正扭弯子，认真考虑如何在坚持双紧方针的条件下做好经济工作，并采取切实措施加以落实。中央反复强调要过几年紧日子，这也是过紧日子的题中应有之义。
