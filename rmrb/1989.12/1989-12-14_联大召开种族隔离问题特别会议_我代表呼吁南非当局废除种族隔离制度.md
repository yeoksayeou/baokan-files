Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, December 12th.

The UN General Assembly special session on "Apartheid and Its Destructive Impact in Southern Africa" opened today at the United Nations headquarters. The session aims to seek common understanding and further joint actions to eliminate the apartheid system in South Africa.

UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, in his speech, pointed out that the apartheid policy violates the basic principles of the UN Charter. The apartheid system threatens international peace and security. He demanded that South Africa completely change its policy of aggression against neighboring countries, which harms the stability and security of these countries, making 1 million people refugees and 4 million displaced.

China's Permanent Representative to the UN, Li Luye, spoke at the meeting, strongly urging the South African authorities to recognize the situation, adopt an enlightened policy, and immediately abolish the apartheid system and all laws and decrees of racial discrimination. He called on the South African authorities to recognize the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, and to engage in serious democratic dialogue with them.

Li Luye finally called on the international community to continue to exert strong pressure on the South African authorities and to actively support and fully assist the struggle of the South African people to achieve the final victory in the fight to abolish apartheid.

Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, in his speech, pointed out that the apartheid system represents state terrorism and is the root cause of tension, instability, and conflict in the region. It has resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million people in the region, half of whom are children under the age of 5, and half of the population of Angola and Mozambique have been displaced.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, in his speech, hoped that this special session of the General Assembly would pay attention to the declaration on the South African issue adopted by the Organization of African Unity in Harare, Zimbabwe, on August 21st this year. The declaration proposed the principle of peaceful negotiations on the South African issue. Mugabe also demanded that the United Nations closely monitor the implementation of sanctions against South Africa.

The conference will last for three days and will ultimately adopt a declaration.

    联大召开种族隔离问题特别会议
    我代表呼吁南非当局废除种族隔离制度
    本报联合国12月12日电　记者刘开宸报道：关于“种族隔离及其在南部非洲破坏性影响”的联大特别会议，今天在联合国大厦开幕。会议将就铲除南非种族隔离制度问题寻求共同认识，并进一步采取共同行动。
    联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔在讲话中指出，种族隔离政策违反了联合国宪章的基本原则，种族隔离制度威胁着国际和平与安全。他要求南非完全改变其侵略邻国的政策，此政策危害这些国家的稳定和安全，使100万人沦为难民，400万人流离失所。
    中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野在会上发言，强烈呼吁南非当局认清形势，顺应历史潮流，采取开明政策，立即废除种族隔离制度和一切种族歧视的法律和法令。他呼吁南非当局承认南非非洲人国民大会和阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会等民族解放组织，并与他们进行认真的民主对话。
    李鹿野最后呼吁国际社会继续向南非当局施加强大压力，并对南非人民的斗争给予积极的支持和充分的援助，以便赢得废除种族隔离斗争的最终胜利。
    赞比亚总统卡翁达在讲话中指出，种族隔离制度代表国家恐怖主义，是该地区紧张、不稳定和冲突的根源。它导致该地区内150万人死亡，其中一半是5岁以下的儿童，安哥拉和莫桑比克的一半人口流离失所。
    津巴布韦总统穆加贝在讲话中希望这届特别联大重视非统组织于今年8月21日在津巴布韦首都哈拉雷通过的关于南非问题的宣言。该宣言提出了就南非问题进行和平谈判的原则主张。穆加贝还要求联合国仔细监督对南非进行制裁的执行情况。
    大会将举行3天，最后要通过一项宣言。
