In the campus of Shanxi Institute of Mining, there is an active group of students who freely repair various household appliances. This team of eight university students not only provides free repair services for the faculty, staff, and students within the school but also frequently goes to the streets of Taiyuan, north to Datong, and south to Jincheng, reaching into rural areas and mines, using their knowledge to serve the parents and fellow villagers who nurtured them.

Many students and teachers have remarked, "Lei Feng has not left; he is still in our campus."

"Hey, my washing machine is broken. Can you guys help me out?" Teachers always trustingly say.

"My tape recorder can be fixed, right? I still rely on it to learn English." Students who come to the door seem so anxious.

"Wow, there's still free repair service on the street?" When they hung up the "Service to the People, Free Repair" sign on the streets of Taiyuan, a few passing youths couldn't help but mock a few words.

"Who would have thought, twenty-some years later, there's a new Lei Feng." This is the sigh of an elderly man with white hair.

A university student fixed the problem with a middle-aged man's color TV, and he gratefully said, "You guys are amazing, truly not taking a single penny! In other places, just opening the cover would cost 50 yuan." This scene took place at the gate of Shanxi Institute of Mining just before National Day this year.

The group organizes such activities several times a year.

In March, the commercial fever among students and the various "get-rich" advertisements in the bulletin boards did not distract them. On the day commemorating the theme "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," they bravely raised the banner of "Learn from Lei Feng, Do Good Deeds," spending an entire day freely repairing more than 30 appliances.

Group leader Jiao Baoguo said, "That day, we were busy from morning to night, but everyone felt fulfilled." He said, "Our group has been adhering to the principle of 'free service' for six years, and this is our tradition."

Six years ago, in 1983, when a wave of "going to society, serving the people" swept through some university campuses, a student named Sun Xianhong from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Shanxi Institute of Mining and a few friends with similar interests established the "Electronics Enthusiasts' Home" and formulated a charter for freely repairing household appliances for the people, determined to do something for society with their knowledge.

Although the conditions were very harsh at the time, the young university students did not retreat. They used their dormitory as a workshop, with simple tools, and in less than a year, they freely repaired various appliances for the masses totaling 750 units (items). More importantly, from then on, "serving the people" became the belief and spirit of this group, passed down from one generation to the next.

When the baton was passed to the students of the 1986 class, Jiao Baoguo and his partners, it was already spring of 1989.

What greeted them was the commercial tide. Many well-meaning friends advised them to provide "paid services," but Jiao Baoguo and his partners politely declined. Each time they served, they only charged for important parts, and small parts were always bought by the group members themselves.

In the spring and summer of this year, this group, composed of one Communist Party member and seven League members, was tested. In May, with the support of the school's Youth League Committee, they firmly established the "Radio Repair Training Class," freely recruiting more than 60 students from within and outside the school, and imparting repair techniques without compensation until mid-June.

On the eve of July 1st, as a gift to the Party's birthday, these eight university students went to the Datong Coal Mine Bureau to serve the coal miners.

In less than a day, the students' skilled repair techniques and enthusiastic service attitude won over the miners. People came to ask them to repair appliances in an endless stream. In a few days, they repaired more than 40 TVs and tape recorders and also taught the miners about household appliance maintenance and repair knowledge. When the miners offered money, the university students smilingly declined; when family members invited them to eat, the university students also smilingly declined. They unanimously said, "We are providing free service."

    雷锋精神在校园
    ——记山西矿业学院的“为民服务小组”
    新华社记者　武岚　鄯宝红
    在山西矿业学院的校园里，活跃着一个免费维修各种家用电器的“为民服务小组”。这支由8名大学生组成的队伍，不仅为校内的师生员工义务修理家用电器，而且经常走上太原街头，北上大同，南下晋城，深入农村厂矿，用他们所学的知识，为养育他们成长的父老乡亲奉献自己赤子之心。
    许多同学和老师感慨地说：“雷锋并没走，他就在我们的校园里。”
    “喂，我家的洗衣机坏了，请你们帮个忙。”老师们总是信赖地说。
    “我的录音机能修好吗？我还靠它学外语呢。”找上门来的同学显得那样焦急。
    “嗬，这大街上还有免费修理一说。”当他们在太原街头挂起“为民服务，免费修理”的招示牌时，几个过路的青年不免冷嘲几句。
    “真想不到，二十几年后，又有了新雷锋。”这是一位白发老者的感叹。
    大学生为一个中年男子的彩电排除了故障，他感激地说：“你们真了不起，真是一分钱不收！要在别处，光开下盖，就得要50元。”这是发生在今年国庆节前夕山西矿业学院校门口的一幕。
    像这样的活动，这个小组每年都要搞好几次。
    3月份，校园里的大学生经商热和那布告栏上五花八门的“发财”、“致富”的广告，没有乱了他们的心，他们在“向雷锋同志学习”题词纪念日这天，勇敢地打出了“学雷锋，做好事”的旗号，整整一天时间义务修理电器30余台。
    组长焦保国说：“那天，我们从早忙到晚，可大家都感到过得充实。”他说：“我们这个小组成立6年来，始终坚持‘免费服务’的宗旨，这是我们的传统。”
    6年前，即1983年，当一些大学校园里掀起一股“走上社会，为民服务”的热潮时，在山西矿业学院，一个名叫孙先红的电气工程系学生和几个志趣相投的朋友成立了“电子爱好者之家”，并制订了免费为民修理家用电器的章程，决心用自己所学的知识为社会做一些事。
    尽管当时条件非常艰苦，但年轻的大学生并没有退缩。他们将宿舍当作工作室，用简陋的工具，在不到一年的时间里，免费为群众修理各种电器750台（件）。更重要的是，从此，“为民服务”成了这个小组的信念和精神一届一届传给了后者。
    接力棒传到86级学生焦保国和他的伙伴们手里时，已经是1989年的春天。
    迎接他们的是经商热潮，不少好心的朋友劝他们搞“有偿服务”，可焦保国他们婉言谢绝了。每次服务，他们只收重要原件费，一些小零件从来都是小组成员们自己花钱买的。
    在今年春夏之交，这个由一名共产党员和7名共青团员组成的小组经受了考验。5月份，这个小组在院团委的支持下，坚定地办起了“收音机修理培训班”，免费招收了校内外60多名学生，无偿地向他们传授修理技术，一直坚持到6月中旬。
    “七·一”前夕，作为献给党的生日的礼物，这8名大学生来到大同矿务局，为煤矿工人服务。
    不到一天时间，这些“学生娃”娴熟的修理技术和热忱的服务态度就令矿工们折服了。来请他们修电器的人络绎不绝。几天时间，他们就修好了40多台电视机和收录机，还给工人们传讲家电保养维修的有关知识。工人们给钱，大学生笑着拒绝了；家属来请吃饭，大学生同样笑着拒绝了。他们众口一词，说：“我们是免费服务。”
