	Why Do Plans Become Empty Words?
		Gao Ming Xiang
		Fuping County, Hebei Province

	Our Fuping County in the Taihang Mountains is a county with only 6 mu of arable land per capita, which is a grain-deficient county. Every year, it consumes several million jin of grain from the state's planned procurement. However, in the past three years, just the construction of public and private buildings in the county seat has occupied several hundred mu of land. Some farmers have only a few fen of land left, and they can only harvest 30 to 40 jin of wheat. The once lush fields have almost all become red or gray buildings.

	In fact, the county seat of Fuping had a very good plan. In the spring of 1984, the county leaders instructed the county construction bureau to formulate a specific plan for building a residential area on Xiaodongshan; in 1987, officials from the Hebei Provincial Construction Commission personally measured and drew the "planning map" for Fuping County, requiring everyone to build houses on hillsides and valleys, neither occupying arable land nor making the mountain city look unsightly. However, some cadres and staff members always complained that living on the mountain was too far from work, so they fought to "squeeze" into the city; while farmers around the county seat treated their contracted land as private property, not only building houses on arable land for themselves but also selling it at high prices to individuals or organizations to build houses. Although the county began to strictly prohibit this, a few households who dared to build new houses on arable land were demolished, yet because the number of households building houses increased, the law could not punish everyone. Moreover, in the past two years, three county committee secretaries and county magistrates have been replaced, and the first two did not want to offend people or cause trouble in Fuping.

	The facts show that in the protection of arable land, there must be laws and plans, and there must be strict enforcement. It is even more important that the local officials always love the land like their own children and enforce the law like a mountain.

    规划为什么成空话？
    河北省阜平县　高明乡
    我们太行山上的阜平县是一个人均只有6分耕地的缺粮县，每年要吃国家几百万斤统销粮。然而，最近三年，光是县城公私盖房就占地三四百亩，有的农民家中只剩下几厘地，麦收只收三四十斤小麦。昔日绿油油的好庄稼地几乎都成了红乎乎或灰乎乎的房屋。
    其实，我县城关镇盖房有过很好的规划。1984年春，县领导责成县城建局制定了在小东山建居民区的具体方案；1987年河北省建设委员会的同志亲自为阜平县城丈量、绘制了“规划图”；要求大家在山坡沟洼建房，既不占耕地，山城又显得美观。但是，一部分干部职工总嫌住在山上上班远，就拚命往城内“挤”；而县城周围农民则把自己的承包田当成私有财产，不仅自家在耕地上盖房，而且以上万元的高价出卖给个人或机关盖房。县里虽然开始严格禁止，拆过几户敢于在耕地上盖的新房，可是因为盖房户越来越多，法不责众，再加上近两年之内换了三任县委书记和县长，前两任因为无心在阜平干，不想得罪人惹麻烦。
    事实说明，在保护耕地问题上，有法，有规划，还得有严格执行的人，而这方水土上的“父母官”都始终一贯地“爱土如命，执法如山”则更为重要。
