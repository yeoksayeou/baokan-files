The Second Committee of the 44th United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on solving the debt problem of the Third World on December 15.

Only the United States voted against the resolution.

The resolution holds that the conditions for a long-term solution to the debt crisis should include: providing a more open international market for the products of developing countries, the commitment of developing countries to diversify their export products, and the efforts of developed countries to reduce interest rates to create a more reasonable international economic environment.

The resolution calls for negotiations between debtors and creditors on a series of issues, including debt reduction, lowering interest rates, and providing new loans, to ensure that the adjustment plans of developing countries for development are fully supported.

At the beginning of 1989, the external debt of developing countries had accumulated to $1.3 trillion, which is equivalent to half of their combined gross national product and twice their annual export earnings. Currently, developing countries have to pay $100 billion in interest on their external debt each year.

    联大二委会通过解决第三世界债务问题决议
    呼吁就削减债务等问题进行谈判
    新华社联合国12月15日电  （记者薛力敏）第44届联合国大会第二委员会15日通过了一项有关解决第三世界债务问题的决议。
    只有美国对决议投了否决票。
    决议认为，债务危机获得长期解决的条件应该包括：向发展中国家的产品提供更为开放的国际市场，发展中国家致力于出口产品多样化、以及发达国家努力降低利率以便创造更加合理的国际经济环境。
    决议呼吁债务双方就削减债务、降低债务利息和提供新贷款等一系列问题进行谈判，使发展中国家以发展为目的的调整计划得到充分支持。
    1989年初，发展中国家的外债累积已达1.3万亿美元，这相当于它们国民生产总值总和的一半，是其年出口收入的两倍。目前，发展中国家每年要为外债付出1000亿美元的利息。
