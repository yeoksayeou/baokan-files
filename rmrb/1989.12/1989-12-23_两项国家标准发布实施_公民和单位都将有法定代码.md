Two national standards issued and implemented: Citizens and organizations to have legal codes

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22 (Reporters Li Anding and Jiang Zaizhong) Two national standards closely related to the social and economic life of the Chinese people, "Social Security Number" and "National Enterprise, Institution, and Social Organization Code," were issued and implemented today by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision.

These two standards create the conditions for the "Social Security Number System" and the "Unified Code Identification System," which have been approved by the State Council and are soon to be implemented in China. The Social Security Number consists of 16 digits and is a unique, lifelong personal identification number issued by the state to each citizen. Based on this number, personal files related to social security will be established. Citizens' bank accounts, property insurance, medical care, employment, social security, and other aspects will be closely linked to their Social Security Numbers. Additionally, Social Security Numbers will be widely used in population statistics, voter registration, compulsory education, military conscription, identity verification, taxation, and social statistics.

The unified code identification for enterprises, institutions, and social organizations is a legal code issued to each enterprise, institution, and social organization that is unique and unchanging nationwide. In China, documents related to business registration, organizational management, social organization registration, bank account management, property insurance, taxation, social security, and other aspects, as well as planning work, statistical work, material allocation, and financial allocation, will all use the unified code identification for enterprises, institutions, and social organizations.

    两项国家标准发布实施
    公民和单位都将有法定代码
    据新华社北京12月22日电（记者李安定、姜在忠）与我国人民社会经济生活关系密切的《社会保障号码》、《全国企业、事业单位和社会团体代码》两个国家标准今天由国家技术监督局发布实施。
    这两个标准为已由国务院批准，即将在我国实行的“社会保障号码制度”和“统一代码标识制度”创造了条件。社会保障号码由16位数字组成，是国家给每一个公民颁发的唯一的、终身不变的个人识别号码，根据这个号码建立各人的社会保障有关的档案。公民的银行帐户、财产保险、医疗保健、劳动就业、社会安全等都将与个人的社会保障号码密切联系起来。同时社会保障号码还广泛应用于人口统计、选民登记、义务教育、现役征兵、身份辨别、纳税、社会统计等领域。
    企业、事业单位和社会团体统一代码标识是给每一个企业、事业单位和社会团体颁发一个在全国范围内唯一的、始终不变的法定代码。我国工商企业登记、机构编制管理、社会团体登记、银行帐户管理、财产保险、税收、社会安全等方面的文件，以及计划工作、统计工作、物资调拨、财政拨款等都将采用企业、事业单位和社会团体统一代码标识。
