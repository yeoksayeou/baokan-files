The situation in the National Women's Volleyball League has become clear: the Liaoning team is on the verge of victory.

The People's Daily, Guangdong Kaiping, December 19th - After tonight's match between the Liaoning team and the Bayi team, the situation in the National Women's Volleyball League has become clear. The defending champions, the Liaoning team, defeated the Bayi team 3:1, clearing the main obstacle on their path to the championship and setting the stage for a repeat victory. Although the Bayi team lost to Liaoning, their remaining two matches against Yunnan and Sichuan, both of which have weaker teams, still give them a chance to secure the runner-up position.

Today's match at the Kaiping Sports Stadium was packed, with a lively atmosphere. The Liaoning team, with an average height of 1.83 meters, utilized their height advantage at the net. The main attackers, Gao Lin and Teng Xiulan, scored with powerful spikes from high points. Lai Yawen and Zhou Hong used varied tactics, placing quick attacks in tricky spots. The first set quickly ended with a score of 15:3 in favor of Liaoning. In the second set, Bayi's national team player, Cui Yongmei, used her powerful left-handed jump serve to score directly or disrupt the opponent's first pass. Meanwhile, the main attacker, Su Liqun, who stands at 1.80 meters, scored consecutively with powerful spikes. This set ended with Bayi winning 15:9. In the third and fourth sets, Liaoning focused on blocking and improved their tactical coordination and backcourt defense, turning the tide of the match. They won the sets 15:9 and 15:7, respectively.

After defeating the Bayi team, Liaoning still has to face Shanghai and Hebei, but these teams lack the strength to compete with Liaoning. The outcome is already decided. Experts predict that the champions and runners-up of this year's women's volleyball tournament will be Liaoning and Bayi.

    全国女排甲级联赛局势明朗
    辽宁队夺魁在望
    本报广东开平12月19日电　经过今晚辽宁队和八一队的交锋，全国女排甲级队联赛形势基本明朗：上届冠军辽宁队以3∶1制服八一队后，已扫清夺魁道路上的主要障碍，蝉联冠军在望。八一队虽负于辽宁队，但由于后两场的对手云南和四川队实力较弱，仍可望夺得亚军。
    今天在开平体育馆举行的女排甲级队联赛，座无虚席，气氛热烈。平均身高1米83的辽宁队发挥网上优势，主攻手高林和滕秀兰高点强攻落地开花，赖亚文和周红战术多变，快攻落点刁钻，第1局很快以15∶3先声夺人。第2局，八一队的国手崔咏梅的左手大力跳发球威力大，时而直接得分，时而破坏对方一传。同时，身高1米80的主攻手苏立群像一门重炮，扣球连连得分。这一局八一队以15∶9还以颜色。第3、4局，辽宁队注意拦网，加强战术配合和后排防守，战局大有起色，以15∶9和15∶7连胜两局。
    辽宁队击败八一队后，还要对付上海和河北两队，但这两队无实力和辽宁队抗衡，大局已定。行家们预测本届女排大赛，冠亚军得主属于辽宁和八一队。（郑文杰）
