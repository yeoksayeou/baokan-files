The 452nd meeting of the Military Armistice Commission of Korea was held at Panmunjom on November 30 at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

At the meeting, General Choi Yi-hong, the chief delegate of the Korean-Chinese side, explained the three new proposals put forward by the North Korean side regarding the cessation of military exercises on the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. He said that these new proposals reflect the minimum requirements for eliminating the danger of nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, and at the same time fully consider the views of the U.S. side.

The U.S. side refused to discuss the issue of stopping military exercises on the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会举行会议
    朝鲜军事停战委员会第452次会议应朝中方面的建议十一月三十日在板门店举行。
    朝鲜军停会朝中方面首席委员崔义雄少将在会议上解释了朝鲜北方提出的关于在朝鲜半岛及其周围海域停止军事演习的三点新建议。他说，这些新建议反映了旨在朝鲜半岛消除核战争危险的最起码要求，同时也充分考虑了美方的主张。　　美方在会议上拒绝讨论在朝鲜半岛及其周围海域停止军事演习问题。
