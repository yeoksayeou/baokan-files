Tongliao City in recent years has persistently carried out agricultural water conservancy construction with personal and collective investment as the mainstay, and with four-level investment. This has strengthened the agricultural foundation. The city has now built 1.4 million mu of high-standard ridged fields and has 10,600 wells, with well-irrigated land accounting for more than 80% of the total cultivated area. This year, despite facing a severe drought not seen in 39 years, the city's total grain production reached 610 million kilograms, setting a historical high.

Tongliao City is a typical semi-arid region in northern China. After repeated deliberation and years of practice, Tongliao City decided to take the path of well-irrigated agriculture. They overcame the mindset of simply "waiting, relying, and begging" and adopted a method of water conservancy construction at the city, township, village, and household levels. They collected funds through multiple channels and levels. Since 1985, the city has invested more than 95 million yuan in water conservancy construction each year, with national investment accounting for 12.6%, city investment 4.4%, and township and village collective investment 83%. Starting from this year, the city's total grain production increased by 50 million kilograms each year. Seeing the crucial role of water conservancy, the enthusiasm of the masses for self-raising funds to build water conservancy has been rising. This year, townships, villages, and the masses raised 135.38 million yuan through loans and self-raising funds, which is 5.4 times the national investment.

To ensure the quality and speed of well drilling and to fully utilize the benefits of well irrigation, Tongliao City insists on unified construction. From the drilling teams to the supply of materials, everything is unifiedly dispatched and commanded by the water conservancy department. After the wells are completed, they must also be jointly inspected by the water conservancy department, township, village, and drilling team.

    通辽市克服“等靠要”思想兴建农田水利
    “四级集资”多投入
    本报讯　内蒙古通辽市近年来坚持不懈地开展以个人和集体投资为主、四级投资的农田水利建设，增强农业后劲，现已建成高标准畦田140万亩，拥有机井1.06万眼，井灌面积占到总耕地面积的80％多。今年在遭受了39年未遇的大旱情况下，粮食总产达到6.1亿公斤，创历史最高水平。
    通辽市是我国北方典型的半干旱地区。经过反复酝酿和多年的实践，通辽市决心走井灌农业之路。他们克服单纯“等靠要”思想，采取市、乡、村、户四级办水利的方法，多层次多渠道筹集资金。自1985年以来，全市每年投入水利建设的资金达950多万元，其中国家投资占12.6％，市投资占4.4％，乡镇村集体投资占83％。从这一年开始，全市粮食总产则每年以5000万公斤的幅度递增。群众看到了水利的命脉作用，自筹资金办水利的积极性日益高涨。今年乡村和群众通过贷款和自筹，投入水利建设资金1353.8万元，相当于国家投资的5.4倍。
    为确保打井质量和速度，充分发挥井灌效益，通辽市坚持统一施工，从井队到供管、供料全部由水利部门统一调度指挥。成井后，也必须经过水利部门、乡、村、井队四方的联合验收。
