Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Xia Junsheng and Yan Shigui reported from Beijing on December 15th: Today, the Beijing Municipal Economic Commission, the Municipal Finance Bureau, and other relevant departments signed contracts with the Beijing Chemical Industry Corporation and the Beijing Light Industry Corporation. This continues the implementation of the "two guarantees and one link" contract management responsibility system during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period.

Since 1987, Beijing has been promoting the "two guarantees and one link" contract management responsibility system throughout the city's industrial system, which has mobilized the enthusiasm of enterprises and workers. To further improve the contract system and ensure a smooth transition between the second round of contracts and the previous round, Beijing decided to sign the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period contracts with enterprises one year in advance in phases. The new round of contracts has taken some new measures to prevent short-term behavior by enterprises and to improve the contract management responsibility system:

	•	On the basis of ensuring a stable increase in national fiscal revenue, the indicators for enterprise technological transformation and fixed asset appreciation are hardened. The Beijing Chemical Industry Corporation will ensure that state-owned assets increase by 5% annually and self-owned liquid funds increase by 3% annually during the five-year contract period. Otherwise, the total annual wage increase will be reduced by 10%.

	•	Implementing "audit first, contract later; audit first, fulfill later" to strengthen supervision over contracted enterprises. After the first round of contract ends, enterprises will be audited first. Those who fail to meet the contracted turnover indicators will have to make up the shortfall with their own funds in the second round of contracts. The operating situation of enterprises will be audited annually before the contract is fulfilled.

	•	The contract will be notarized to make it legally binding and authoritative.

    北京提前签新一轮承包合同
    做好衔接工作，企业早吃“定心丸”
    本报北京12月15日讯　新华社记者夏俊生、本报记者颜世贵报道：北京市经委、财政局等有关单位今天同北京市化学工业总公司和二轻工业总公司签订承包合同，在“八五”期间继续实行以“两保一挂”为主要形式的承包经营责任制。
    北京市从1987年开始在全市工业系统推行“两保一挂”的承包经营责任制后，调动了企业和职工的积极性。为了进一步完善承包制，做好第二轮承包与前一轮的衔接工作，给企业早吃“定心丸”，北京市决定分期分批，提前一年同企业签订“八五”期间的承包合同。新一轮的承包合同在防止企业短期行为、完善承包经营责任制等方面采取了一些新的措施：
    ——在确保国家财政收入稳定增长的基础上，硬化企业技术改造和固定资产增值指标。北京化学工业总公司在5年承包期内，将保证国有资产每年递增5％，自有流动资金每年递增3％。否则，当年新增工资总额将被扣减10％。
    ——实行“先审计，后承包；先审计，后兑现”，以加强对承包企业的监督。一轮承包合同结束后，对企业先审计，完不成承包合同上缴指标的要在第二轮承包中用自有资金补足，对企业每年的经营情况先进行审计，再兑现承包合同。
    ——对承包合同实行公证，使之具有法律效力和权威性。
