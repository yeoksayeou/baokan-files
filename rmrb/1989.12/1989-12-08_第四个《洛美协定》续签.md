The European Economic Community and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific reached an agreement on December 7 to renew the Lome Convention. The fourth convention will be signed on December 15 in Lome, the capital of Togo.

At the end of November, both sides held their fifth ministerial-level meeting in Brussels. The EEC had differing opinions on how much financial aid to provide to the ACP countries. After heated debates within the EEC, the total aid amount was increased to 11.9 billion European Currency Units (including a 1.2 billion loan from the European Investment Bank), but this was still far from the 15.5 billion proposed by the ACP countries. On December 4, the EEC countries added an additional 1 billion. On December 7, the ACP countries agreed to the terms.

    第四个《洛美协定》续签
    本报布鲁塞尔12月7日电  记者魏崴报道：欧洲共同体和非洲、加勒比、太平洋地区国家7日就续签《洛美协定》达成一致。第四个协定将于15日在多哥首都洛美签字。
    11月底，双方在布鲁塞尔举行了第五轮部长级会议。欧共体在向非加太国家提供多少财政援助上，意见不一。欧共体内部经过激烈争吵，将援款总额增至119亿欧洲货币单位（其中包括欧洲投资银行的12亿贷款），但离非加太国家提出的155亿差距仍大。12月4日，欧共体诸国再追加1亿。12月7日，非加太国家予以同意。
