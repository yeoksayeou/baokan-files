Poland has issued a statement on the issue of German unification, declaring that it will not allow any changes to the current Polish-German border.

The news agency Xinhua reported from Warsaw on December 5th that the spokesperson for the Polish President made a statement saying that the issue of German unification is not just a matter for the German people, but also a concern for the people of all European countries, as it "involves the security of Germany's neighboring countries and other European nations."

The statement emphasized that regardless of future developments and the evolution of relations between the two Germanys, Poland "will always steadfastly defend its national territorial integrity" and will not permit "any modifications to the existing Polish-German border."

    波就德国统一问题发表声明
    不允许修改波德边界现状
    新华社华沙12月5日电  波兰总统新闻发言人5日发表声明说，德国统一问题不仅是两个德国人民的事情，而且是欧洲各国人民共同关心的事情，因为这“涉及到德国的邻国和其他欧洲国家的安全”。
    声明对联邦德国国内一些人士要求修改第二次世界大战后形成的波兰西部边界的言论表示不安。
    声明说，不论今后事态和两个德国关系将如何发展，波兰“将始终不渝地捍卫自己国家的领土完整”，决不允许“对波德现有的边界作任何修改”。
