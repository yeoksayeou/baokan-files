In the exhibition room near the entrance of the Gabonese Trade Union's headquarters in Libreville, there are several beautifully crafted machine-embroidered tablecloths hanging. The patterns on them include flying birds, swimming goldfish, and blooming flowers.

Everyone who comes to visit cannot help but exclaim in admiration.

Some people say that if these were taken to the market, they would surely fetch a good price. Those who are not familiar with the situation might think that China is holding a product exhibition here. Little do they know that these handicrafts are actually made by Gabonese girls. The cooperation between the two countries' trade unions in this area has already yielded good results.

The story goes back to two years ago. In 1987, our trade union delegation visited Gabon. The leaders of the Gabonese Trade Union had long admired Chinese machine-embroidered products and had expressed a desire to invite Chinese technicians to train Gabonese women.

The following year, Chinese technician Wu Minhua and translator Xiao Wang arrived in Libreville. Wu Minhua is a designer from the Hangzhou Institute of Arts and Crafts. He is skilled in painting and familiar with various stitching techniques, making him an expert in machine embroidery.

On August 3, 1988, the machine embroidery training class officially began. The first batch of 22 female students mostly came from lower-class families in Gabon, with only a primary school education. However, they love Chinese machine embroidery art and cherish this learning opportunity.

They studied diligently without interruption. After less than a year of training, they not only mastered common stitching techniques and could produce items from patterns but also learned simple pattern drawing. Teacher Wu was satisfied and told the reporter, "They are all clever and quick learners. In our country, it would be considered quite good if someone reached this level in a year."

On August 2 of this year, the first batch of students completed their training. The graduation ceremony was held that day, and the Gabonese Trade Union headquarters was as lively as during a festival. The general secretary of the trade union, the director of the vocational training bureau, officials from the International Labour Organization, representatives from various mass organizations, and reporters from television stations and newspapers all came to participate.

The students' faces were filled with joy and pride.

They hung their favorite products on the wall, neatly writing their names in the lower right corner. They have high hopes for the future; some want to work in a company, some want to start their own factory, some want to pass on the art of machine embroidery to more friends, and some even hope to study further in China... Among the guests, the owner of a clothing store immediately decided to hire three students to work in his factory.

The director of the Gabonese Vocational Training Bureau happily said, "Educating women means educating the entire nation, because they are responsible for raising children." He thanked China for helping Gabon do such a meaningful job.

The old students have graduated, and new students have already started their classes. The sound of sewing machines is playing the beautiful melody of Sino-Gabonese friendship!

    加蓬姑娘手儿巧
    本报记者　杨汝生
    在利伯维尔市加蓬工联驻地靠门的一间陈列室里，悬挂着一块块做工精美的机绣台布，上面的图案有的是鸟儿翻飞，有的是金鱼戏水，有的是花朵绽放。
    凡来此参观的人无不发出啧啧的赞叹。
    有人说若是拿到市上，准能卖个好价钱。不明情况的人还以为中国在此举办商品展销呢，哪知这些工艺品竟是出自加蓬姑娘之手。中加两国工会在这方面的合作，已经取得良好的效果。
    事情还要从两年以前说起。1987年，我工会代表团来加蓬访问，加蓬工联领导人早就垂青中国的机绣制品，曾表示想请中国派技师来培训加蓬妇女。
    第二年，中国技师吴敏华和翻译小王来到利伯维尔。吴敏华是杭州工艺美术研究所的设计人员。他擅长绘画，也熟悉各种针法，是一名机绣行家。
    1988年8月3日机绣培训班正式开课。首批22名女青年大多来自加蓬较下层的家庭，只有小学毕业文化程度，但她们酷爱中国的机绣艺术，非常珍惜这个学习机会。
    他们勤学苦练，从不间断，经过不到一年的培训，不仅掌握了常用的针法，可照图生产，而且学会简单的描图。小吴技师满意地对记者说：“她们个个都心灵手巧，技术学的很快，我们在国内培养机绣人员，一年能达到这种水平也算不错的了。”
    今年8月2日，第一批学员结束了培训。举行结业典礼的那天，加蓬工联驻地像过节一样热闹。工联总书记、职业培训局局长、国际劳工组织的官员以及一些群众组织的代表和电视台、报社的记者都来参加。
    学员们个个脸上洋溢着喜悦和自豪的神情。
    她们把最中意的产品挂在墙上，在右下角端端正正地写上自己的名字。她们对未来充满了憧憬，有人想到某个公司去工作，有人想自己办厂，有人想把机绣艺术传授给更多的伙伴，有人还希望能到中国深造……来客中有一家服装店的老板，当即决定挑选3名学员到他的厂子里工作。
    加蓬职业培训局局长高兴地说，“教育妇女则意味着教育整个民族，因为她们担负着抚育子女的任务”。他感谢中国帮助加蓬做了一件十分有意义的工作。
    老的学员毕业了，新的学员早已开班。那哒哒哒的缝纫机声，正奏响着中加友谊的美好乐章！
