On the evening of September 28, 1989, at the Yucheng Coal Mine Club in Henan Province, the “I Love My Country National Day Workers' Gala” was in full swing. Two young girls from Yunnan, dressed in matching outfits, walked onto the stage from the audience and bowed deeply to the full house. Accompanied by electronic music, they sang “Sing a Mountain Song for the Party to Hear,” expressing their gratitude to the coal mine police station and the coal mine party organization for rescuing them from a miserable fate.

The girls on stage were Wang Fang, a 15-year-old Hani girl, and Tang Yanhua, a 14-year-old Dai girl. They lived in the suburbs of Jiangcheng, a Hani and Yi Autonomous County in the southern border region, and were classmates at the same school. They had left home in a fit of anger with their parents and ended up wandering in Jiangcheng County, where they were spotted by a human trafficker from Sichuan named He Gang. He Gang concocted a series of lies to gain the trust of the innocent girls, and together they boarded a train heading inland. They were then deceived and sold to Henan Province’s Yucheng County. He Gang sold Tang Yanhua for 2,500 yuan to a family in Xiaocheng Township in neighboring Anhui Province’s Suixi County, and sold Wang Fang for the same price to a family in Gaozhuang Township’s Puli Village in Yucheng County, with the transaction set to take place on the evening of August 16.

In the evening, righteous-minded informants reported this situation to the Yucheng Coal Mine Police Station. Station Chief Gao Sidao, Deputy Chief Wang Jiayin, and police officer Sang Guiliang, along with Gaozhuang Township Police Station Chief Gao Jie and two other officers, swiftly took action, and Wang Fang was rescued.

After initial questioning, the whereabouts of Tang Yanhua were determined. Without resting, the officers boarded a police car and found the tortured Tang Yanhua that same afternoon.

After being brought to the coal mine police station, Wang Fang and Tang Yanhua were visited by Deputy Secretary of the Mine Party Committee Liu Xuyou, who represented the party organization in expressing concern for them and made specific arrangements for their living conditions, protection, and repatriation.

On September 25, representatives from the Jiangcheng County Women's Federation arrived at the Yucheng Coal Mine from distant Yunnan, crossing mountains and valleys, to personally escort the girls back home.

“Sing a mountain song for the Party to hear, I compare the Party to my mother…” Wang Fang and Tang Yanhua’s sweet voices, filled with genuine emotion from the heart, moved and stirred everyone present. Both on stage and off, everyone spontaneously joined in the singing.

    一支深情的歌
    永歧　理远
    一九八九年九月二十八日晚上。
    河南省永城煤矿俱乐部。
    正当在这里举行的“我爱中华国庆职工联欢晚会”高潮迭起的时候，两位身着同样时装的云南小阿妹从观众席上走上了舞台，向座无虚席的观众深深地鞠了一躬。随后，在电子乐器的伴奏下，她们俩共同演唱了“唱支山歌给党听”这首歌，表达了她们俩对煤矿派出所和煤矿党组织把她们从火坑中解救出来的感激之情。
    台上的少女，一个是十五岁的哈尼族姑娘王芳，另一个是十四岁的傣族小妹唐艳波。她们同住在南部边陲的江城哈尼族彝族自治县城郊，又是在一所中学读书的同窗好友。只因同父母生气离开了家，漂流在江城县城，被当时正在江城的四川人贩子何刚盯住。何刚编造了一套谎言，骗取了天真无邪的姑娘的信任，一起登上了通往内地的列车，被辗转骗到河南省永城县。何刚将唐艳波以二千五百元的身价卖到了邻近的安徽省睢溪县小城乡，又以同样的身价把王芳卖给永城县高庄乡坡里村一户人家，并定于八月十六日晚一手交钱一手交人。
    傍晚，富有正义感的知情群众将这一情况报告了永城煤矿派出所。所长高思道、副所长王家寅、民警桑桂亮会同高庄乡派出所所长高杰和两个民警迅速出击，王芳得救了。
    经过初审，弄清了唐艳波的下落。干警们没顾上休息，又登上了警车，当天下午就找回了受尽折磨的唐艳波。
    王芳和唐艳波被接到煤矿派出所后，矿党委副书记刘须友代表党组织到派出所看望了她们，并就她们的生活、保护和遣送工作做了具体安排。
    九月二十五日，江城县妇联的同志从远隔崇山峻岭的云南来到了永城煤矿，专程来接她们回去。
    “唱支山歌给党听，我把党来比母亲……”王芳和唐艳波甜润的歌声伴着从心底涌出的真挚情感，感染和激动着每个人的心，台上台下都不约而同地跟着唱了起来。
