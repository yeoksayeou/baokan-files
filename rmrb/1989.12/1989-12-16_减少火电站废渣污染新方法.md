According to a report by the Soviet magazine "Science and Life," in order to reduce the pollution of the environment by waste from thermal power plants, Soviet scientists have proposed a method of covering and solidifying the waste and transforming the waste piles into fertile land.

A covering layer several millimeters thick, composed of grass seeds, fertilizer, and plant-based materials, is spread over the waste pile. On top of this, a layer of non-woven fabric made from organic waste from the textile industry is placed. After half a year, the covering layer begins to decompose, providing conditions for the growth and development of the grass seeds. Such a covering layer can remain on the waste pile for 5 to 7 years.

To transform the waste pile into arable land, it takes about 10 years. During this period, a layer of fertile soil 50 centimeters thick forms on the waste, which can be used for the growth of various crops.

The Soviet Union has already tested this method at the Southern Urals thermal power plant in Chelyabinsk and other locations. The Soviet Union plans to use this solidification method to transform over 10 million square meters of waste piles.

    减少火电站废渣污染新方法
    新华社莫斯科12月13日电据苏联《科学与生活》杂志报道，为减少火电站的废渣对环境的污染，苏联科学家提出了用覆盖法固渣、并把渣堆变成良田的办法。
    在渣堆上铺上由草籽、化肥及植物基组成的数毫米厚的覆盖层，上面再盖上一层由纺织工业的有机物下脚料制成的无纺布。半年后，覆盖层开始腐烂，为草籽的生长发育提供了条件。这样的覆盖层可在废渣堆上保留5至7年。
    要把废渣堆变成耕地，需要10年时间。在这期间，渣土上形成一层50厘米厚的沃土，可供各种农作物生长用。
    苏联已在车里雅宾斯克的南乌拉尔火电站等地试用这一方法。苏联打算用这种固渣法改造100多万平方米的渣土堆。
