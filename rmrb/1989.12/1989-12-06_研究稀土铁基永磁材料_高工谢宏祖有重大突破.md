Senior Engineer Xie Hongzu of the Baotou Rare-Earth Research Institute in Inner Mongolia has made significant breakthroughs in the research of rare-earth iron-based permanent magnetic materials and has recently been awarded the National Science and Technology Progress First-Class Award.

Rare-earth iron-based permanent magnetic materials, which emerged in 1983, are known for their excellent magnetic properties and low cost. However, their high temperature coefficient and low operating temperature have limited their applications. In 1986, Xie Hongzu took on the task of researching how to reduce the temperature coefficient and increase the operating temperature of these materials. After more than two years of repeated experiments, a high-temperature (200 degrees Celsius), low-temperature coefficient, and cost-effective rare-earth iron-based permanent magnetic material, HLN-200, was developed. Test results show that this material, when used in electric motors and high-temperature magnetic couplings, not only improves product performance but also reduces the cost of raw materials.

    研究稀土铁基永磁材料  高工谢宏祖有重大突破
    据新华社呼和浩特12月5日电　（记者杨慎和）内蒙古包头稀土研究院高级工程师谢宏祖，在稀土铁基永磁材料研究上连续取得重大突破，最近被授予国家科学技术进步一等奖。
    稀土铁基永磁材料是1983年问世的新型材料，具有磁性能好价格低廉等特点，但由于它的温度系数大、使用温度低，使其应用受到限制。1986年，谢宏祖承担了降低稀土铁基永磁材料的温度系数和提高其使用温度的研究工作。经过两年多的反复试验，一种具有高使用温度（200摄氏度）、低温度系数的廉价稀土铁基永磁材料HLN—200问世。使用结果表明，这种材料用于电机、高温磁力传动器等，不仅提高了产品性能，而且降低了原材料成本。
