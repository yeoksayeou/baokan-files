Canada: One-Quarter of Children Living in Poverty

	The People's Daily, Ottawa, November 29th - Reporter Guo Wenfu reports: This week, in his final speech to the parliament before retiring from politics, the leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, Ed Broadbent, stated that in a country known as one of the wealthiest in the world, one-quarter of children are still living in poverty. This is a national shame that must be eliminated.

	The New Democratic Party is one of three political parties in the Canadian federal parliament. Broadbent has served as the party's leader for 14 years and will officially step down next week. He is a prominent politician in Canada.

	Broadbent said that a survey in 1973 found that the proportion of poor children in Canada was 21%, and now it has risen to 25%. Today, there are still 151,000 children across the country who receive food aid every month.

	Broadbent explained that by poverty, he means low birth weight and high infant mortality rates. The infant mortality rate among the poor is twice that of the rich, and poor children also suffer from various diseases. The proportion of poor children with poor health is 15% higher than the national average.

	He lamented, "This is happening in Canada in 1989, not 1939!"

	According to a report by the Canadian Financial Post today, based on data from the Canadian Statistics Department in 1987, in 1986, there were 3.6 million people in Canada living below the poverty line, including 895,000 families and 1.137 million single individuals, among whom approximately 1.1 million were children. The poverty line is defined as a family of four with an annual income of less than 26,600 Canadian dollars, or a single individual with an annual income of less than 13,400 Canadian dollars. In 1987, the per capita income in Canada was 18,079 Canadian dollars.

    加拿大：四分之一儿童受穷
    本报渥太华11月29日电  记者郭文福报道：加拿大新民主党领袖布罗德本特本周在他即将告别政坛向议会散发的最后一篇讲话中说，在号称世界上最富裕的加拿大，迄今仍有1／4的孩子过着贫穷的生活，这实在是应当消除的一种“国耻”。
    新民主党是加拿大联邦议会中的三个政党之一，布罗德本特任该党领袖已14年，下周将正式卸任，他是加拿大一位有影响的政治家。
    布罗德本特说，1973年的一项调查发现，加拿大全国穷孩子的比例为21％，而现在已上升到25％。今天全国还有15.1万的孩子每月要领取食品救济。
    布罗德本特解释说，他所说的贫穷是指婴儿体重不足，且死亡率高。穷人的婴儿死亡率比富人的高一倍，同时穷孩子还染有各种疾病，穷孩子中体质差的比例也比全国平均水平高15％。
    他感叹道：“这是发生在1989年的加拿大事情，而不是1939年！”
    另据加拿大《金融邮报》今天报道，依据1987年加拿大统计部门的数字，1986年加拿大全国有360万人生活在贫困线以下，这包括89.5万个家庭和113.7万个单身，其中孩子的数字约110万。而所谓贫困线是指四口之家年收入在2.66万加元，或单身年收入在1.34万加元以下者，1987年加拿大全国的人均收入是18079加元。
