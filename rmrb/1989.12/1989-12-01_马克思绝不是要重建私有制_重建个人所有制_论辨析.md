	Marx did not aim to reestablish private ownership. Some people in China who advocate privatization argue that Marx, in "Capital," spoke of "reestablishing individual ownership" in the future society, which means establishing a private ownership system where everyone owns the means of production. They use this as a basis to conclude that the current public ownership system is a misunderstanding of Marx's ownership theory. Since Marx proposed to "reestablish individual ownership," the goal of our economic reform should be to privatize state-owned property and develop private ownership. I believe this view does not align with Marx's original intent.

	Firstly, from a literal interpretation of Marx's statement, there is no intention to reestablish private ownership. Based on his critique of the internal structure and contradictions of capitalist private ownership, Marx described the ownership form of the future society as follows: "Capitalist private ownership is the first negation of individual private ownership based on one's own labor power. But capitalist production, by the necessity of the natural process, creates its own negation. This is the negation of the negation. This negation is not the reestablishment of private ownership, but the reestablishment of individual ownership on the basis of the achievements of the capitalist era, that is, on the basis of cooperation and the common ownership of land and production resources produced by labor itself." ("Capital," Volume 1, page 832)

	In this passage, Marx conveys several points. First, capitalist private ownership based on wage labor is a negation of individual private ownership based on personal labor. There are two types of private ownership: one is based on the labor of the producer, and the other is based on the exploitation of others' labor. In the former type, the laborer both owns the means of production and the products, acting as an owner, and also engages in labor. This is a form of small-scale private ownership. This dispersed, small-scale production and management method is incompatible with socialized large-scale production. As social productive forces develop, this type of private ownership gradually becomes an obstacle and must be eliminated. It manifests as the transformation of individually owned means of production into means of production owned by a few capitalists. In the initial stage of this transformation, violence is used to forcibly separate producers from their means of production, expropriating small-scale production through the primitive accumulation of capital. Capitalist private ownership, as a negation of laborers' private ownership, continuously reproduces itself in the process of eliminating small-scale production.

	Second, socialist public ownership is a negation of capitalist private ownership. Capitalist private ownership is also a historical category. After the capitalist mode of production became dominant, the target of expropriation is no longer individual laborers but capitalists who exploit wage laborers. In the competition for surplus value, capital rapidly concentrates and develops into monopolies. With the development of productive forces, the private monopolization of means of production becomes increasingly incompatible with socialized large-scale production, becoming a shackle on the development of productive forces, and thus it must be expropriated. It is necessary for wage laborers to expropriate capitalists and for public ownership to replace capitalist private ownership.

	Third, the reestablished individual ownership is a new form of public ownership. The transformation of small-scale private ownership into capitalist private ownership is the first negation of private ownership, where the few expropriate the many. The transformation from capitalist private ownership to socialist public ownership is the negation of the negation of private ownership, where the laboring people expropriate the few exploiters. This negation is not the reestablishment of private ownership but the transformation of private ownership into a new form of public ownership. With the development of cooperation and the common use of land and production resources, the contradiction between socialized production and private ownership becomes increasingly sharp. To resolve this contradiction, it is necessary to "make the mode of production, appropriation, and exchange consistent with the social nature of the means of production" ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Volume 3, page 437). This requires the common ownership of the achievements of the capitalist era by society and, on this basis, the recombination of laborers with socialized means of production. At this point, laborers are no longer the dispersed, small-scale private owners of the past but have become united social laborers. The reestablishment of individual ownership refers to the combination of united social laborers with socialized means of production, a form of public ownership where united social laborers own socialized means of production. This constitutes the economic foundation of the new system of the future society. Therefore, from a literal interpretation, the reestablishment of individual ownership is not the reestablishment of private ownership.

	Next, from Marx's consistent discussions on the ownership of the future society, the reestablishment of individual ownership is not about reestablishing private ownership. Marx and Engels believed that the future society is a "union of free individuals," and to achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate private ownership that hinders the development of productive forces and replace it with public ownership. They used many terms to discuss the public ownership of the future society, which should be understood in their original context. The collective ownership they mentioned is not the collective ownership by a part of the laborers as opposed to the full public ownership today, but collective ownership as opposed to individual ownership, meaning the ownership by the entire society. State ownership, in their view, is also a form of social ownership. As for individual ownership, it is not the same concept as individual ownership in today's economy. It refers to the ownership of production resources by united individuals, which is also a form of social ownership. Because Marx believed that the future society "excludes everything that exists independently of the individual" ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Volume 3, page 79), capitalist ownership can only be eliminated by transforming it "into non-isolated individual ownership, that is, into the ownership of united social individuals" (ibid., Volume 48, page 21). "The ownership of the total sum of productive forces by united individuals eliminates private ownership" (ibid., Volume 3, page 77). Thus, transforming the monopolized means of production by the bourgeoisie into "the property of united producers, that is, direct social property" (ibid., Volume 25, page 494). Therefore, regardless of whether Marx and Engels used public ownership, state ownership, collective ownership, or individual ownership, the basic meaning is that the means of production are commonly owned by all laborers, and united laborers own all means of production. The various forms of ownership they discussed, although the terms differ, all refer to the public ownership of the future society.

	Furthermore, from the conditions Marx mentioned for reestablishing individual ownership, there is no possibility of reestablishing private ownership. The conditions Marx mentioned for reestablishing individual ownership in the future society of a union of free individuals, apart from the highly developed productive forces, include several often-overlooked conditions. First, commodity economy no longer exists in the future society. Engels wrote in "Anti-Dühring," "Once society takes possession of the means of production, commodity production will be eliminated, and the domination of products over producers will also be eliminated." Because Marx and Engels believed that capitalist economy and commodity economy are one and the same, with the elimination of capitalist private ownership in the future society, capitalist commodity economy will also be eliminated, and there will be no commodity economy in the future society.

	Second, classes and class struggles have been eliminated in the future society. Marx and Engels believed that one of the main results of the abolition of private ownership is the "complete elimination of classes and class antagonisms" ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Volume 1, page 224). Before the future society, people were not individuals but members of classes in the entire social relationship. In the future society, with the elimination of private ownership, the class characteristics imposed on people by capitalist production relations will also be eliminated.

	Third, the future society implements a single public ownership system. Marx and Engels believed that the future society is to "transform capital into public property belonging to all members of society" and "concentrate all means of production in the hands of the state, that is, the organized ruling class of the proletariat," until "all production is concentrated in the hands of united individuals" (ibid., pages 266, 272, 273). This ownership form not only completely eliminates capitalist private ownership but also individual ownership, and there is no collective ownership by a part of the laborers, making it a single public ownership system across the entire society.

	Fourth, individuals in the future society are fully developed. Marx believed that "the abolition of private property is the complete emancipation of all human senses and characteristics" ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Volume 42, page 124). "Humans, in a comprehensive manner, that is, as a complete individual, possess their comprehensive essence" (ibid., page 123). This indicates that the full development of humans is consistent with the social norms of public ownership of means of production. This is reflected in the status of laborers, who are freed from the slavery of means of production and become the masters of means of production; in their relationship with division of labor, laborers are liberated from the old social division of labor and no longer slavishly obey the division of labor; in the role of labor, productive labor is no longer a means of livelihood but has transformed from a burden into a joy, becoming the first need of life. Due to the establishment of public ownership and the full development of individuals, the situation where social productive forces become an alien social force opposing individuals will also disappear. The individuals mentioned here are socialized individuals, fully developed and completely liberated free individuals.

	It can be seen that the highly developed productive forces, the elimination of commodity economy, the absence of classes and class struggles, and the establishment of a single public ownership system across the entire society are objective conditions, while the full development of laborers is a subjective condition. Due to the absence of soil for the production of private ownership and the lack of motivation for laborers to pursue private interests, these conditions interact to prevent the emergence of factors for the private ownership of means of production, making it impossible to reestablish private ownership.

	In summary, Marx discussed the ownership of the future society from the perspective of negation of the negation, completely negating private ownership. The reestablished individual ownership is a new form of public ownership. Therefore, the concept of "reestablishing individual ownership" should not be interpreted as reestablishing private ownership, nor should it be used as a reason for the privatization of socialist public property.

    马克思绝不是要重建私有制
    ——“重建个人所有制”论辨析
    李连仲
    国内主张私有化的人认为，马克思在《资本论》中说的要在未来社会“重建个人所有制”的实质，就是要建立生产资料“人人皆有”的私有制。并以此为依据得出现在实行的公有制形式是对马克思所有制理论的一种误解。马克思既然提出了要“重建个人所有制”，那么我们经济改革的目标就应该把国有财产个人化，发展私有制。我认为这个看法不符合马克思的原意。
    首先，从马克思论述这段话字面上理解，没有重建私有制的意思。马克思在批判资本主义私有制内部结构及其矛盾的基础上，曾对未来社会的所有制形态做了如下描述：“资本主义的私有制，是对个人的、以自己劳动力为基础的私有制的第一个否定。但资本主义生产由于自然过程的必然性，造成了对自身的否定。这是否定的否定。这种否定不是重新建立私有制，而是在资本主义时代的成就的基础上，也就是说，在协作和对土地及靠劳动本身生产的生产资料的共同占有的基础上，重新建立个人所有制。”（《资本论》1卷，832页）
    马克思在这里讲了以下几层意思。第一，以雇佣劳动为基础的资本主义私有制是对以个体劳动为基础的私有制的否定。私有制有两种，一种是以生产者自己的劳动为基础，另一种是以剥削别人的劳动为基础。前一种类型劳动者一方面占有生产资料和产品，是私有者，另一方面自己又进行劳动。这是一种小生产私有制。这种分散的小规模生产经营方式与社会化的大生产是不相容的。随着社会生产力的发展，这种私有制逐渐成为阻碍力量而必须要被消灭。它表现为，把个人分散占有的生产资料转化为少数资本家占有的生产资料。在这个转化初期是以暴力迫使生产者和生产资料相分离，通过资本原始积累的方式对小生产进行剥夺。资本主义私有制作为对劳动者私有制的否定，在消灭小生产的过程中不断地再生产出来。
    第二，社会主义公有制是对资本主义私有制的否定。资本主义私有制也是一个历史范畴。资本主义生产方式占统治地位以后，要剥夺的已不是个体劳动者，而是那些剥削雇佣工人的资本家。资本家在追逐剩余价值的竞争中使资本迅速集中并发展成为垄断。随着生产力发展，生产资料的私人垄断愈来愈同社会化大生产不相容，成为生产力发展的桎梏，因而它必然要求被剥夺。要求雇佣劳动者剥夺资本家，要求生产资料公有制取代资本主义私有制。
    第三，重建的个人所有制是一种新型的公有制形式。小生产私有制转化为资本主义私有制，是对私有制的第一个否定，是少数人剥夺多数人。从资本主义私有制转化为社会主义的公有制，是劳动人民剥夺少数剥夺者的过程，是对私有制的否定之否定。这种否定不是重新建立私有制，而是要把私有制转变为一种新型的公有制形式。随着协作和共同使用土地及生产资料的发展，生产社会化与私人占有的矛盾日益尖锐，要解决这个矛盾，就应该“使生产、占有和交换的方式同生产资料的社会性相适应”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第3卷，437页）。这就要求由社会共同占有资本主义时代的这些成就，并在此基础上使劳动者与社会化的生产资料重新结合。这时劳动者已不是过去那种分散的、以自己劳动为基础的小私有者，而是已经成为联合起来的社会劳动者。重建个人所有制，就是指联合起来的社会劳动者与社会化的生产资料相结合，由联合起来的社会劳动者占有社会化生产资料的一种公有制形式。它构成了未来社会新制度的经济基础。所以，从马克思字面上理解重建个人所有制决不是重建私有制。
    其次，从马克思对未来社会所有制的一贯论述中看，重建个人所有制也不是讲重建私有制。马克思、恩格斯认为未来社会是一个“自由人联合体”，为了实现这个目标，就必须消灭阻碍生产力发展的私有制并代之以公有制。他们对未来社会公有制论述使用了很多提法，应按照本来面目来理解。那时所提的集体所有制，并不是今天所说的与全民所有制相区别的部分劳动者集体占有。而是与个人相对立的集体占有，它是整个社会占有的意思。国家所有在他们看来也是社会占有的一种形式。至于个人所有制，它与今天经济中的个人所有制更不是一个概念。它是讲联合起来的个人占有生产资料，这也是社会占有的一种形式。因为马克思认为，未来社会“排除一切不依赖于个人而存在的东西”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第3卷，79页），资本主义所有制只有通过将其“改造为非孤立的单个人的所有制，也就是改造为联合起来的社会个人的所有制，才可能被消灭。”（同上48卷，21页）“联合起来的个人对全部生产力总和的占有，消灭着私有制”（同上3卷，77页）。从而把资产阶级垄断的生产资料变成“联合起来的生产者的财产，即直接的社会财产”（同上25卷，494页）。所以，马克思、恩格斯在讲所有制时，不管使用的是公有制、国家所有制、集体所有制，还是个人所有制等，基本含义都是生产资料为全体劳动者共同所有，联合起来的劳动者占有全部生产资料。他们讲的这些所有制形式，尽管说法不一，但都是讲未来社会的公有制。
    再次，从马克思讲重建个人所有制条件看，也不具备重建私有制的可能性。马克思所说的在未来社会自由人联合体中重建个人所有制的条件，除了生产力高度发展这一条件外，还有以下几个条件往往被忽视。第一，未来社会中商品经济已不复存在。恩格斯在《反杜林论》中写道，“一旦社会占有了生产资料，商品生产就将被消除，而产品对生产者的统治也将随之消除。”因为马克思、恩格斯认为资本主义经济和商品经济是一回事，在未来社会资本主义私有制消灭了，资本主义商品经济也就随之消灭，未来社会是不存在商品经济的。
    第二，未来社会中阶级和阶级斗争也已消灭。马克思、恩格斯认为，废除私有制的最主要结果之一，就是“彻底消灭阶级和阶级对立”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第1卷，224页）。在未来社会以前，人们不是作为个人而是做为阶级的成员处于整个社会关系中。在未来社会中随着私有制的消灭，这种资本主义生产关系赋予人们的阶级规定性也就消除了。
    第三，未来社会实行的是单一公有制。马克思、恩格斯认为，未来社会就是要“把资本变为属于社会全体成员的公共财产”，“把一切生产工具集中在国家即组织成为统治阶级的无产阶级手里”，直至“全部生产集中在联合起来的个人手里”（同上卷，266、272、273页）。这种所有制形式不仅完全消灭了资本家私有制，而且消灭了个体所有制，同时也不存在部分劳动人民集体所有制，因而这是一种全社会范围的单一公有制。
    第四，未来社会的个人是全面发展的。马克思认为，“私有财产的扬弃，是人的一切感觉和特性的彻底解放”  （《马克思恩格斯全集》第42卷，124页）。“人以一种全面的方式，也就是说，作为一个完整的人，占有自己的全面的本质。”（同上，123页）这说明人的全面发展同生产资料公有制的社会规范原则是相适应的。它表现在劳动者地位上，劳动者摆脱了生产资料奴役的状况，成为生产资料的主人；在与分工的关系上，劳动者从旧的社会分工束缚下解放出来，不再奴隶般地服从分工；在劳动的作用上，生产劳动不再是谋生的手段，已从一种负担变成一种快乐，成为生活第一需要。由于公有制的建立和个人的全面发展，社会生产力成为与个人相对立的异己的社会力量状况也就消失了。这里所说的个人是社会化的个人，是全面发展和彻底解放的自由人。
    可以看出，生产力高度发展，商品经济消亡、阶级和阶级斗争已不存在，全社会单一公有制的建立这几个条件是客观条件，劳动者全面发展是主观条件。由于客观上没有产生私有制的土壤，主观上劳动者又没有追求私人利益的动机，在这些条件相互作用下，无法产生生产资料私人占有的因素，不存在重新建立私有制的可能性。
    综上所述，马克思从否定之否定的角度论述了未来社会的所有制，彻底否定了私有制。重建的个人所有制是一种新型的公有制形式。所以，不能将“重建个人所有制”这一提法解释为重建私有制，更不能以此做为社会主义公有财产私有化的理由。
