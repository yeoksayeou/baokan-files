Since the founding of the People's Republic, Shandong's Haiyang County has completed nearly 3,000 water projects, with a cumulative direct investment of 110 million yuan. These projects have ensured the steady development of grain production in Haiyang County. However, due to various reasons, the water conservancy sector itself has fallen into a serious crisis:

Massive funds have been invested with no returns. Due to the lack of depreciation fees and maintenance costs, not only has the massive investment of over 100 million yuan been gradually eroded and scrapped as the water projects age, but the county also has to spend 2 million yuan annually to pay the interest on loans taken for past water conservancy projects.

Water projects are deteriorating and severely damaged. According to a 1987 survey, only 11% of the water projects in the county are classified as first-class, 52% as second-class, and 37% as third-class. Over 1,000 water conservancy structures are operating with defects, 340 kilometers of main and branch canals have collapsed or are blocked, and over 400 wells are in urgent need of repair. As a result, the county's irrigated area has decreased by nearly one-quarter.

Water resources are being wasted. In the past, due to the lack of or minimal irrigation fees, farmers generally used the method of flooding to irrigate their fields, without considering how to improve water resource utilization. According to statistics from three medium-sized reservoirs, last spring's irrigation supplied 12.51 million cubic meters of water, irrigating only 19,000 acres, with an average water usage of over 650 cubic meters per acre. The highest recorded usage was 1,500 cubic meters per acre.

Funds are tight, and water conservancy projects are at a standstill. With the development of agricultural production, farmers who lease land, orchards, and other economic crops have an increasing demand for water. The county's 110,000 acres of reduced irrigated land urgently need to be restored, and another 180,000 acres of cultivated land need water conservancy facilities as soon as possible. However, since 1985, the state has reduced funding for village-level water projects, and village-level collective savings are also limited, relying on past savings to get by.

The severe reality has made the cadres and masses of Haiyang County realize that in the new situation, water management must thoroughly reform the outdated management methods that violate the law of value and do not emphasize economic benefits. They must manage water projects like managing enterprises, taking the path of water sustaining water, management promoting construction, and self-development.

To quickly implement enterprise management of water projects, Haiyang County's Party Committee and government established the "Water Project Enterprise Management Leading Group" and set up the "Water Project Enterprise Management Guidance Station" last year. They first selected a batch of villages for pilot projects, and after gaining experience, the county government formally issued the "Temporary Regulations on Enterprise Management of Water Projects." The Water Conservancy Bureau compiled the "Haiyang County Water Project Enterprise Management Handbook," and organized training classes for township and rural cadres. Starting from the second half of last year, the new method of water management has been universally adopted across the county.

First, they established and improved water project management organizations and fully implemented the project management responsibility system. Each village established a professional water project management team. According to the size of the village and the number of projects, 3-10 people were arranged for the management team. They signed contracts with the village committee for the operation of water projects, clearly defining the responsibilities, rights, and interests of both parties. The tasks of the water project team are: to manage all water facilities in the village according to the unified standards set by the county water conservancy bureau, to allocate water flow, and to collect water fees, etc. They operate independently, with their own profits and losses.

Second, each village established a special account for water projects. The village committee and the water project management team together conducted a detailed inventory of all water projects in the village, conducted asset verification, and verified the construction costs, equipment investment, supporting tools, funding sources, etc. They then set up six accounts: the water project general ledger, fixed asset detailed ledger, material detailed ledger, transaction detailed ledger, income and expenditure detailed ledger, and cash deposit ledger. All accounts were separated from the village's general ledger and managed by the water service team's accountant, with a separate account opened at the Agricultural Bank.

Third, they determined the water fee standards. They calculated the annual fixed asset depreciation, maintenance, management, energy, and loan interest based on the total investment and depreciation period of the water projects, and added 4% profit to determine the total cost for the year. They then set the water fee standard per acre of irrigation. Considering the difference in income between grain crops and economic crops, they implemented different water prices for different crops. After determining the water fees, the county implemented management measures such as pre-allocating water, allocating water per acre, pre-purchasing water tickets, supplying water based on tickets, saving water for oneself, not compensating for waste, and charging extra for overuse, making water a true commodity.

They also required the water management team to utilize the water surface and slope protection land of reservoirs, ponds, and large wells for comprehensive operations, and stipulated that 80% of the income should be used for water project maintenance, and 20% of the income should be distributed to the management personnel.

To increase the momentum of water conservancy construction, the county government decided to establish a rural water conservancy development fund. It was stipulated that each village should allocate 80% of the fixed asset depreciation, major repair fees, and 80% of the profit realized in the current year from water projects as the rural water conservancy construction development fund, mainly used for the expansion and reproduction of water projects and the construction of new water projects.

The new method quickly brought new changes: the management level of water projects has improved. In the county's 732 villages, 80% have established professional service teams, totaling 2,630 people. In just over a year, more than half of the damaged projects and equipment from previous years have been repaired. According to inspections by the municipal and county water conservancy departments this year, the proportion of first-class projects in the county has risen to 28%, second-class projects to 48%, and third-class projects have decreased to 24%.

The utilization rate of water resources has improved. In the past, due to the lack of dedicated management of water projects, the irrigation order was chaotic, disputes over water allocation frequently occurred, and waste was severe. Now, the village water service teams implement unified water release, unified management, and irrigation according to the water flow direction, which is convenient for the masses, eliminates water disputes, and shortens the irrigation cycle. According to statistics from three medium-sized reservoirs this spring, the water usage per acre has decreased by 50% compared to the same period last year, the irrigation cycle has been shortened from 30 days to 25 days, saving over 8 million cubic meters of water, equivalent to adding one reservoir. In Zhao Zhuang Township, the average water usage per acre has been reduced to 90 cubic meters, saving 700,000 cubic meters of water annually. In the past, it took 27 days to irrigate the entire township, but now it only takes 14 days.

The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for self-reliant water conservancy development has been aroused. Water conservancy construction has regained vitality, and cadres and the masses have seen hope. Last winter and this spring, the county-wide mass movement of raising funds and labor for water conservancy construction has been widely carried out. The collective and the masses have raised 62 million yuan and contributed 3.6 million labor days, completing 1,005 water projects and expanding 180,000 acres of irrigated land. This spring, despite the severe drought in Haiyang, the water projects played a role, and the wheat yield and total production both set new historical records.

The momentum for developing rural water conservancy has been strengthened. Haiyang County can extract 48 million yuan in fixed asset depreciation and major repair fees for water projects annually, and 57 million yuan in profits as a water conservancy development fund. Adding the comprehensive operational income of the water service teams, the county has over 120 million yuan available for water conservancy construction. This winter, the county directly invested nearly 200 million yuan, equivalent to the total water conservancy construction investment from 1984 to 1987.

    走“以水养水”之路
    ——海阳县实行水利工程企业化管理的调查
    于国夫　王智亭
    严峻的现实
    建国以来，山东海阳县共建成各种水利工程近3000项，累计直接投资1.1亿元。这些工程，保证了海阳县粮食生产的稳步发展。但是由于种种原因，水利事业本身却陷入了严重的危机：
    巨额资金有投无回。由于不提折旧费和工程维修费等，不仅上亿元的巨额投资随着水利工程的老化、报废而逐年消触，而且全县每年还要拿出200万元的资金支付历年水利建设拖欠的贷款利息。
    水利工程退化、损坏严重。据1987年底调查，全县水利工程中，一类工程仅占11％，二类占52％，三类占37％。1000余座水利建筑物带病运行，340公里干、支渠坍塌和阻塞，400多眼机井急待维修。因此，全县灌溉面积减少了近1／4。
    水资源浪费严重。由于以往浇地不收费或收费很少，农村浇地普遍采用大水漫灌的办法，根本不考虑如何提高水资源利用率的事。据三座中型水库统计，去年春灌共供水1251万立方米，仅浇地1.9万亩次，平均每亩次用水量达650多立方米，最多的一次一亩竟用水1500立方米。
    资金紧缺，水利事业无以为继。随着农业生产的发展，承包土地、果园及其它经济作物的农民，对水的需求越来越多。全县减少的11万亩灌溉面积急待恢复，还有18万亩耕地，需尽快配套水利设施。然而，自1985年起国家就减少了对村级水利工程的拨款，而村级集体自身积累也很有限，只能靠吃过去的老本过日子。
    严峻的现实，使海阳县的干部群众认识到，在新形势下搞水，必须彻底改革那种违背价值规律、不讲经济效益的陈旧管理方法，像管理企业那样来管理水利工程，走以水养水、以管促建、自我发展的新路。
    全新的方法
    为了使水利工程企业化管理工作尽快实现，去年海阳县委、县政府成立了“水利工程企业化管理领导小组”，专设了“水利工程企业化管理工作指导站”。他们先选择一批村庄搞试点，在取得经验之后，县政府正式制定下发了《关于水利工程实行企业化管理的暂行规定》，水利局编写了配套的《海阳县水利工程企业化管理简明教材》，举办了乡镇和农村干部培训班。从去年下半年开始，全县普遍用新法管水。
    首先，他们建立健全水利工程管理组织，全面落实工程管理责任制。各村成立专业水利工程管理队。根据村子的大小、工程多少，安排3—10人为工程管理队。他们与村委会签定承包经营水利工程合同，明确双方的责、权、利。水利工程队的任务是：按照县水利局统一制定的水利工程管理标准，管好本村所有的水利设施，调度水流，收取水费等。实行独立核算、自负盈亏。
    其次，各村建立水利工程专帐。村委会与水利工程管理队一起，对全村的水利工程逐项摸底，进行清产核资，把工程造价、设备投资、配套机具、资金来源等逐一核实，然后建起6本帐：水利工程总帐、固定资产明细帐、材料明细帐、往来明细帐、收支明细帐和现金存款帐。所有的帐目都从村里的总帐分离出来，由水利服务队的会计专管，并在农业银行单立帐户。
    第三，核定水费标准。他们根据水利工程的总投资和折旧年限，计算出每年应提取的固定资产折旧费、维修费、管理费、能源费和贷款利息，再加4％的利润，核算出当年的总成本，再定出亩次灌溉的水费标准。照顾到粮食作物与经济作物的收益差距，他们对不同作物实行不同水价。水费确定后，全县又实行了水量预分、按亩配水、预购水票、凭票供应、节约归己、浪费不补、超用加价等管理措施，使水真正成为商品。
    他们还要求水利管理队利用水库、塘坝、大口井的水面及护坡地，开展综合经营，并规定80％的收入用于水利工程的维修，20％的收入分配给管理人员。
    为了增加水利建设的后劲，县政府决定建立农村水利发展基金。规定，各村每年要把水利工程提取的固定资产折旧费、大修理费和当年实现利润的80％，作为农村水利建设发展基金，主要用于水利工程的扩大再生产和兴建新的水利项目。
    显著的效果
    新法很快带来了新变化：水利工程的管理水平提高了。全县732个村80％建立了专业服务队，总人数达2630人，仅一年多时间，前几年毁坏的工程和设备，就有一半多得到了修复。据今年市、县两级水利部门检查，全县一类工程已上升到28％，二类工程48％，三类工程下降为24％。
    提高了水资源的利用率。过去由于水利工程无专人管，浇地秩序混乱，争水抢水的纠纷时有发生，而且浪费严重。现在，各村水利服务队实行统一放水、统一管理、按水流向依次浇地，方便了群众，杜绝了抢水现象，缩短了灌溉周期。据今春对三个中型水库灌区统计，每亩水的用量比去年同期下降50％，灌溉周期由30天缩短到25天，共节水800多万立方米，相当于增加了一座水库。赵疃乡平均每亩次用水下降到90立方米，年可节水70万立方米。过去全乡浇一遍水需27天，现在仅用14天。
    调动了干部群众自力更生发展水利的积极性。水利建设有了活力，干部群众看到了希望。去冬今春，集资投劳、大搞水利建设的群众性活动在全县普遍展开。集体和群众集资达620万元、投工360万个，修建水利工程1005项，扩大水浇地18万亩。今春，尽管海阳遇到了严重干旱，但因水利工程发挥了作用，小麦单产、总产均创历史新纪录。
    增强了发展农村水利的后劲。海阳县每年可提取水利工程固定资产折旧费、大修理费480万元，利润570万元，作为水利发展基金，再加上水利服务队的综合经营收入，全县有1200多万元，可用于水利建设。今年冬季，全县直接投资近2000万元，相当于1984年到1987年水利建设投资的总和。
