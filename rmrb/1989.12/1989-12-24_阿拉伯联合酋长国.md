The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is composed of seven emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain, Fujairah, and Ras Al Khaimah, collectively known as the "Seven Jewels of the Oil Sea." The UAE is located in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering the Gulf of Oman to the east, Qatar to the west, Oman and Saudi Arabia to the east and south, and the Persian Gulf to the north. It serves as a strategic gateway from the Gulf to the Indian Ocean, holding a significant strategic position. The UAE covers a total area of 85,000 square kilometers, with most of its territory consisting of deserts and lowlands, and it has a hot desert climate.

The population is over 1.6 million, with about one-third being Arab, and the rest being foreigners. The official language is Arabic, and English is widely used. The majority of residents are Muslims. The capital is Abu Dhabi.

The UAE is rich in oil and natural gas resources. By the end of 1983, proven oil reserves amounted to 4.5 billion tons, ranking seventh in the world, making it a major oil-producing and exporting country. Oil revenue accounts for more than 85% of the national budget. Last year, oil export earnings reached over $10 billion. Over the past decade, the UAE has transformed from an obscure desert-poor country into one of the countries with the highest per capita national income in the world. While vigorously developing the oil and natural gas industries, the UAE government has paid great attention to diversifying the national economy, focusing on the development of aluminum smelting, plastic products, building materials, food processing, and beginning to develop agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Economic prosperity has promoted the development of education, culture, and healthcare. The UAE has implemented free education and free medical treatment nationwide.

The United Arab Emirates was established on December 2, 1971. President Zayed sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing a willingness to develop relations with China in various fields. On December 8, Premier Zhou Enlai replied, announcing that the Chinese government decided to recognize the United Arab Emirates. Since then, people-to-people exchanges and economic trade relations between the two countries have continued to develop. After China and the UAE formally established diplomatic relations in November 1984, relations between the two countries in politics, economy, and culture have been further strengthened. In 1985, Vice Premier Yao Yilin and State Councilor Wu Xueqian, who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited the UAE. In 1987, UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs Rashid visited China, and exchanges between the two governments have become increasingly frequent. This visit by Chairman Yang Shangkun will usher in a new stage in Sino-UAE relations.

    阿拉伯联合酋长国
    阿拉伯联合酋长国（简称阿联酋）由阿布扎比、迪拜、沙迦、阿治曼、乌姆盖万、富查伊拉、哈伊马角七个酋长国组成，素有“油海七珍”之称。阿联酋位于阿拉伯半岛东南部，东临阿曼湾、西望卡塔尔、东部和南部与阿曼、沙特阿拉伯接壤，北濒海湾，是海湾通往印度洋的门户，战略地位十分重要。阿联酋总面积为85000平方公里，境内大部分是沙漠和洼地，属热带沙漠气候。
    人口160多万，1／3是阿拉伯人，其他为外籍人，官方语言是阿拉伯语，通用英语。居民大多信奉伊斯兰教。首都阿布扎比。
    阿联酋石油和天然气资源丰富，1983年底已探明的石油储量为45亿吨，居世界第七位，是重要的石油生产国及输出国。石油收入占财政收入的85％以上。去年原油出口收入达100多亿美元。十几年来，它从一个默默无闻的沙漠穷国，一跃成为世界人均国民收入最高的几个国家之一。在大力发展石油天然气工业的同时，阿联酋政府十分注意国民经济的多样化，重视发展炼铝、塑料制品、建筑材料、食品加工等工业，并开始发展农、牧、渔业。经济的繁荣促进了文教卫生事业的发展，阿联酋全国实行了免费教育和免费治疗。
    阿拉伯联合酋长国于1971年12月2日宣告成立，扎耶德总统致电周恩来总理，表示愿意同我国发展各方面关系。12月8日，周恩来总理复电宣布中国政府决定承认阿拉伯联合酋长国。此后，两国民间往来及经济贸易关系不断发展。1984年11月中国与阿联酋正式建立外交关系后，两国在政治、经济文化等方面的关系得到了进一步加强。1985年姚依林副总理、吴学谦国务委员兼外长先后访阿；1987年阿外交事务国务部长拉希德访华，两国政府间交往日益密切。此次杨尚昆主席的出访，将使中阿两国关系进入一个新阶段。
