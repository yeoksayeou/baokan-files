A general bid farewell to a singer. People braved the early winter chill, gathering at Babaoshan to bid farewell to this soldier-singer. Those who passed by his side included former comrades-in-arms and fellow performers, fans who were captivated by his voice, and mentors who had invested their hearts in his growth...

Amidst the mournful music, a general stepped forward with heavy footsteps and stood by Ma Guanguo's side for a long time. He was Yang Baibing, the Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission. During his time working in the Beijing Military Region, Yang Baibing showed particular concern for this singer who had once been a vagrant. During holidays and festivals, he often visited Ma Guanguo's home. When Ma Guanguo suffered a heart attack, the general personally arranged for emergency treatment and visited his bedside. When bourgeois liberalization was rampant in society and the "performing outside of official channels" trend swept through the arts community, the general timely reminded Guanguo and his comrades to stay sober-minded and lead the way in listening to the Party, helping them strengthen their ability to resist erroneous trends. At this moment, the general was filled with emotions and said with deep regret, "Guanguo left too soon..."

Those who came to bid farewell to Guanguo also included several generals from the Beijing Military Region, including old commanders and political commissars such as Zheng Weishan and Chen Xianrui. Old leaders of the Beijing Military Region such as Qin Jinguang, Yang Chengwu, Liao Hansheng, Li Degeng, Yuan Shengping, and Fu Chongbi, who could not attend due to other commitments, sent condolences by phone and sent wreaths to mourn Ma Guanguo's passing. They were all Ma Guanguo's mentors and friends on his life's journey. Under their warm care, Ma Guanguo studied at the Music Academy, joined the Communist Party of China, and realized his lifelong dream...

Ma Guanguo was a first-class performer in the Beijing Military Region's Comrades' Troupe. He passed away on November 21 due to illness, at the age of 57. As a child, he was separated from his family and wandered from place to place. It was the Party that nurtured him into a famous male vocalist. He had received guidance and care from the beloved Premier Zhou. Premier Zhou, in his lifetime, watched "The Long March Symphony" multiple times and asked Ma Guanguo to teach him the song "Mao Zedong's Military Genius." He encouraged them to spread the spirit of the Long March through their songs. Once, when Ma Guanguo was chatting with Premier Zhou, he casually mentioned having high blood pressure. To his surprise, the next day, the Premier sent someone to deliver a bottle of blood pressure medication to his home, instructing him to take care of his health. A Premier busy with a thousand tasks, yet he cared about the health of an ordinary cultural warrior! It was precisely because of the Party and the countless leaders and comrades who cared for him in every way that Ma Guanguo grew from a vagrant into a politically steadfast and artistically skilled singer. Ma Guanguo often said during his lifetime, "I was unlucky as a child, losing my mother's love; I am also a lucky person, as the Party gave me maternal warmth."

Ma Guanguo did not disappoint the Party's expectations. Singing about the Party, the people's army, and socialist motherland was the main theme of his artistic career for decades. As his comrades wrote on the memorial banner they gave him: "His songs resonated across the country, truly bringing joy to people; his voice echoed in the barracks, truly living up to the title of 'I am a soldier.'"

    将军为歌手送行
    新华社记者　赵苏　陈辉
    马国光去了。人们冒着初冬的寒风，早早来到八宝山，为这位战士歌唱家送行。从他身边缓缓走过的，有曾同他并肩战斗、同台演出的战友，有对他的歌声如痴如醉的观众，还有为他的成长倾注了心血的师长……
    哀乐声中，一位将军迈着沉重的脚步走来，在马国光身边肃立良久。他是中央军委秘书长杨白冰上将。杨白冰在北京军区工作期间，对这位流浪儿出身的歌唱家格外关心，逢年过节，常到他家里看望。马国光心脏病发作时，将军多次亲自安排抢救治疗，并到病榻前问候。当社会上资产阶级自由化泛滥，文艺界刮起“走穴”风时，将军及时提醒国光和他的战友们，要头脑清醒，带头听党的话，使他们增强了抵御错误思潮的能力。此刻，将军感慨万端，无限痛惜的说了一句话：“国光走的太早了……”
    前来为国光送行的，还有北京军区的老司令员、老政委郑维山、陈先瑞等20几位将军。秦基伟、杨成武、廖汉生、李德生、袁升平、傅崇碧等北京军区的老首长，因故没能前来，分别打来电话，送来花圈，对马国光的离去表示哀悼。他们都是马国光人生旅途上的良师益友。在他们的亲切关怀下，马国光进音乐学院深造，加入中国共产党，实现了终生夙愿……
    马国光是北京军区战友文工团一级演员，他因病于11月21日逝世，享年57岁。他幼年与家人失散四处流浪，是党把他培养成为著名男中音歌唱家。他曾受到过敬爱的周总理的教诲和关怀。周总理生前多次观看《长征组歌》，并要马国光教他唱“毛主席用兵如神”一段唱，勉励他们用歌声传播长征精神。有一次，马国光在同周总理谈心时，无意中流露出自己有高血压，想不到，第二天总理就派人把一瓶降压药送到他家中，嘱咐他一定要注意保重身体。一位日理万机的总理，竟把一位普通文艺战士的健康挂在心上！正由于有党和众多的首长、战友无微不至的关怀，马国光才从一名流浪儿成长为政治上坚定、艺术精湛的歌唱家。马国光在世时常说，我从小失却母爱，是不幸儿；我又是一个幸运者，党给了我母亲般的温暖。
    马国光没有辜负党的期望。歌唱党，歌唱人民军队、歌唱社会主义祖国，是他几十年艺术舞台的主旋律。正如他的战友们送给他的挽幛所写：歌荡神州确实《真是乐死人》，声迥军营不愧《我是一个兵》。
