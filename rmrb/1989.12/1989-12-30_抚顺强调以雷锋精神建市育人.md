	Fushun Emphasizes Building the City and Educating People with Lei Feng Spirit

	People's Daily reports that recently, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government invited all the Lei Feng learning model workers who have emerged in the city over the past 30 years to a symposium. Municipal Party Secretary Liu Zhenhua, on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, stated that the learning Lei Feng activity should be institutionalized, and the city should be built and people educated with Lei Feng spirit.

	Fushun is Lei Feng's second hometown and the birthplace of Lei Feng spirit. It has a glorious tradition of learning from Lei Feng for 30 years. At the symposium, everyone unanimously agreed that learning from Lei Feng should focus on the core content of Lei Feng spirit, which is to establish a firm belief in the Party, the motherland, and socialism, and to have a high spirit of self-sacrifice for the ideal of communism, just like Comrade Lei Feng.
