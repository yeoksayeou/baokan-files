Marshal Nie Rongzhen has written a preface for "General Ye Ting's Biography," enthusiastically praising the noble qualities of the great general Ye Ting, which are a spiritual treasure left to posterity and worthy of learning and emulation.

Marshal Nie wrote: Ye Ting is a great military strategist and one of the founders of the People's Liberation Army of China. In his early years, he graduated from the Baoding Military Academy, followed Sun Yat-sen's revolution, participated in the Kuomintang and the Guangdong Army, and bravely fought to defend Sun Yat-sen, overthrow warlords, and unify China. In 1924, during his studies in the Soviet Union, he joined the Communist Party of China. In 1925, he returned to China to help establish the Fourth Army Independent Regiment led by the Communist Party, making significant contributions to cultivating this elite force and supporting the peasant movement in Guangdong. During the Northern Expedition, he led the Independent Regiment to break through enemy lines and achieve numerous victories, earning the Fourth Army the title of "Iron Army." He himself was hailed as a "Northern Expedition General." After the failure of the Great Revolution, he led his troops to participate in and lead the Nanchang and Guangzhou uprisings. After the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising, he was pursued by the Kuomintang and was wrongly criticized within our party, leading him to leave in anger and spend ten years in exile abroad and in Macau. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he helped establish the New Fourth Army, serving as the commander, and fought deep in enemy territory. However, during the New Fourth Army Incident, he suffered an unjust accusation and was imprisoned. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was rescued from prison but died in a plane crash on his way to Yan'an to attend a military conference. Ye Ting's life was filled with both glorious victories and numerous setbacks. He advanced with the times, showing unwavering loyalty, firmness, and courage to the revolutionary cause. His noble character of facing great difficulties without fear and upholding principles in critical moments is particularly admirable.

Marshal Nie recalled his deep friendship with Ye Ting, noting that he and Ye Ting shared many common experiences in their fighting careers, which he will never forget. Ye Ting left a deep impression on him, and this spiritual wealth is also left to the army and future generations, which is still worth learning and emulating today.

Marshal Nie said in the preface that Ye Ting loved his country and his people and had a lofty revolutionary ideal. Born in a poor and backward China that was bullied by foreign powers, Ye Ting, as a young man, was moved by the national crisis and took it upon himself to "revive the nation and strengthen the army." He diligently studied military and cultural knowledge; even during his exile abroad, he continued to study military literature, research military engineering, and explosive technology. He vowed to save the nation from peril, saying, "What is danger? What is fame? What is profit?" He only wanted to "strive towards the path of saints." Today, we should learn from this noble patriotism and contribute to the prosperity and strength of our motherland.

Ye Ting loved the army and the soldiers, showing the spirit of leading by example and fearlessness in the face of danger. He strictly managed the troops, conducting rigorous political education and military training. He believed that only through hard training in peacetime could one achieve victory in wartime and defeat the enemy. He was adept at strategic planning and brave in leading the charge. Wherever there was danger, he would be there. This fearless spirit is the political essence of our army. Commanders like Ye Ting, who remain calm in the face of danger, have a great exemplary role and can sometimes play a crucial role in turning the tide of battle.

Ye Ting was upright and had the noble quality of not being swayed by wealth or power. After being imprisoned during the New Fourth Army Incident, the Kuomintang tried every means to persuade him to join their side, offering him high positions and riches. However, he stood firm and unyielding, using various methods to resist in prison, writing "Prison Song," and declaring, "I do not wish to live in disgrace, to tarnish my past deeds. I wish to preserve my true feelings and enter hell," and "I wish to die for my soldiers to redeem their lives," determined to sit out his prison sentence. After enduring 10 years of exile and 5 years of imprisonment, his faith in the party became even stronger. After his release, the first thing he did was to send a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, requesting to rejoin the party.

    学习名将品格为国多作奉献
    新华社北京12月28日电　聂荣臻元帅为《叶挺将军传》作序，热情称赞一代名将叶挺的高贵品质，是留给后代的精神财富，值得学习借鉴。
    聂帅写道：叶挺是一位伟大的军事家、中国人民解放军的创建人之一。他早年毕业于保定陆军军官学校，追随孙中山革命，参加国民党和粤军，为保卫孙中山、打倒军阀、统一中国进行了英勇的斗争。1924年，他在苏联留学期间加入了中国共产党。1925年回国参预组建共产党领导的国民革命军第四军独立团，为培养这支劲旅和支援广东西江农民运动，作出了重大贡献。北伐战争中，他率领独立团斩关夺隘，屡建奇勋，为四军赢得“铁军”称号，他本人被誉为“北伐名将”。大革命失败以后，他率部队参加领导了南昌、广州两次武装起义。广州起义失败以后，他遭到国民党的通缉，又在我们党内受到错误清算，因而愤然出走，在国外和澳门过了十年流亡生活。抗日战争时期，他又参预组建新四军，出任军长，深入敌后，对日作战。但又在皖南事变中蒙受不白之冤，被关进牢房。抗战胜利后，他被营救出狱，却又在赴延安参加整军会议途中，坠机殉职。叶挺一生中有过许多辉煌胜利，也遭受过许多失败挫折。他随着时代的前进而前进，对革命事业无限忠诚，无比坚定，无比勇敢。他那临大难而不惧，临大节而不苟的崇高品格，尤其令人感佩。
    聂帅在回顾他和叶挺的战斗友谊时指出，我和叶挺有很深的战斗友谊，对那些共同的战斗生涯，一直难以忘怀。叶挺给我留下深刻的印象，也是他留给我军，留给后代的精神财富，十分丰厚。直到今天，仍然值得学习借鉴。
    聂帅在《序》中说，叶挺爱国爱民，有崇高的革命理想。他出生在贫穷落后、倍受列强凌辱的旧中国，青少年时期就因“家计不堪，复哀国难”，抱着强兵富国的思想，以“振污世，起衰弱”为己任，勤奋地学习军事和文化知识；即使流亡国外，他还在攻读军事著作，研究军事工程科学和爆破技术。他立志拯救国家民族于危亡，曾发誓要做革命的圣贤：“险安足惧，名安足慕，利安足求”，一心只想“向圣贤路上鞭策”。今天，我们应当好好学习这种高尚的爱国主义思想，为祖国的繁荣强盛贡献力量。
    叶挺热爱军队，热爱士兵，有着身先士卒，临危不惧的英雄气概。他治军从严，对部队进行严格的政治教育和军事训练。他认为只有平时“苦练出精兵”，战时才能夺取胜利，战胜敌人。他精于运筹帷幄，也勇于冲锋在前。哪里有困难危险，他就在那里出现。这种当兵不怕死的大无畏精神，正是我军的政治本色。像叶挺这样镇定处险的指挥员，有着极大的榜样力量，有时能起以少胜多，扭转战机的重要作用。
    叶挺洁身自爱，有富贵不能淫，威武不能屈的高贵品质。皖南事变被囚禁以后，国民党威逼利诱，想尽办法，要他转到国民党方面去，给以高官厚禄。但他大义凛然、宁折不弯，以各种方式，坚持狱中斗争，作“囚歌”，义正词严地声明：“挺不愿苟且偷生，以玷前修，愿保其真情而入地狱”，“愿以一死为部曲赎命”，决心把牢底坐穿，“在烈火与热血中得到永生”。他在历经10年流亡，5年铁窗的冤屈磨难之后，对党的信念愈加坚定，出狱后的第一件事，就是致电中共中央，要求重新入党。
