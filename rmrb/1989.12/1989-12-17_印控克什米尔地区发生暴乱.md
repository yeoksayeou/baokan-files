Riots broke out again in Indian-controlled Kashmir on the 15th, resulting in five deaths and more than 250 injuries.

To control the situation, the government has deployed troops to the riot-affected areas and imposed a curfew on five towns, including Srinagar, Anantnag, and Baramulla.

Muslim armed groups attacked government institutions, police stations, and public buildings. They clashed with police who tried to stop them and opened fire.

Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh notified the Chief Minister of Kashmir, Abdullah, to go to New Delhi on the 15th to discuss countermeasures.
