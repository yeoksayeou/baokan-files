Since March of this year, Zibo City in Shandong Province has implemented a system of vertical job rotation and mutual assignment for cadres in departments with strong professional characteristics within the municipal government. This system rotates cadres annually.

Cadres sent from the municipal to district (county) government agencies are primarily those with good political qualities, strong work capabilities, and promising prospects, as well as those lacking experience in lower-level party and government work. Cadres sent to municipal departments for on-the-job training are mainly those with some grassroots leadership experience but who are unfamiliar with the department's work. The mutual assignment of cadres is generally done on a one-to-one basis. Upon completion of the job rotation period, the organizational department conducts an assessment, the receiving unit writes an evaluation, and the cadre writes a summary before returning to the original unit.

From the practice of the first batch of cadres who underwent vertical job rotation for over half a year, the effects have been evident: cadres sent down have become familiar with and understood grassroots work, accumulating experience; cadres sent up have broadened their horizons and improved their organizational coordination capabilities; communication between upper and lower levels has been enhanced; and, without changing the organizational structure, the goal of training cadres has been achieved. At the same time, it has also broadened the channels for knowing and using people.

    纵向换岗　对口互派
    淄博实行干部挂职锻炼制度
    本报讯　今年3月起山东省淄博市，在市区机关专业性较强的部门中，实行纵向换岗、对口互派干部挂职学习锻炼制度，每年轮换一次。
    淄博市由市直到区（县）机关帮助工作的干部，主要是政治素质好、工作能力较强、有培养前途的干部和缺乏下级党政群机关工作经验的干部。选派到市直机关对口学习锻炼的干部，主要是有一定基层领导工作经验，但不熟悉部门工作的基层干部。互派干部一般采用一对一互派的形式。挂职期满由组织部门考察，接受单位写出鉴定，干部本人写出总结后返回原单位。
    从第一批实行纵向换岗干部半年多的实践看，效果明显：下去的干部熟悉、了解了基层工作，积累了经验，上来的干部开阔了视野，提高了组织协调能力；沟通了上下联系；在机关不动编制的情况下，达到锻炼干部的目的。同时，也拓宽了知人用人渠道。　（兹竹忠）
