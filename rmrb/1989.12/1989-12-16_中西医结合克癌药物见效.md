Edition: 5

The first type of drug developed from the perspective of the relationship between trace elements and cancer, the combined traditional and Western medicine drug “Kekai 7851,” has been proven through years of traditional Chinese medicine clinical trials and nearly two years of extensive modern medical research to be a drug with no side effects and some efficacy against lung and liver cancer.

Over the past decade, Liu Tongle and Liu Guoqing, two folk traditional Chinese medicine practitioners at the Dongfang Medical and Health Center in Beijing, have achieved unexpected results by supplementing trace elements (mainly copper and iron) and using traditional Chinese herbs for differentiated treatment of late-stage cancer patients. However, they lacked the capability to conduct in-depth basic theoretical research.

After studying the clinical results of the Liu brothers, Professor Xin Mingling, Vice President of the Chinese Medical Association and a renowned thoracic surgeon in China, enthusiastically supported their work. Over the past two years, the Clinical Research Institute of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital has confirmed in multiple animal experiments that the average tumor inhibition rate of “Kekai 7851” is 48%, with a maximum of 70.9%. In 37.5% of the animals, the tumors disappeared. Pathological histological studies also found that the tumor tissues of the treated animals were severely damaged, inhibiting and reducing cancerous ascites, and lowering the tumor incidence rate.

Over the past two years, the China-Japan Friendship Hospital has treated more than 400 patients with various types of cancer diagnosed according to international standards. Among them, 218 cases were primary and metastatic lung cancer, with 148 cases showing effectiveness and significant improvement, accounting for 67.9%; 60 cases were primary and metastatic liver cancer, with 39 cases showing effectiveness and significant improvement, accounting for 65%; 16 cases were malignant brain tumors, with 12 cases showing effectiveness and significant improvement, accounting for 75%; the remaining cases were malignant tumors of the digestive system and other types, with effectiveness and significant improvement in 65% of the cases. Most patients reported feeling better after taking the medication, experiencing reduced pain, and extended life.

    中西医结合克癌药物见效
    第一种从微量元素与癌症关系的角度出发，研制出的中西医结合药物——“克癌7851”，经过多年中医临床和近2年大量的现代基础医学实验研究证明，是一种无副作用，对肺癌、肝癌有一定疗效的药物。
    十余年来，在北京东方医疗保健中心肿癌科应诊的刘同乐、刘国庆两位民间中医、对晚期癌瘤病人采取补充微量元素
  （主要是铜和铁），辅以中草药辨证施治，取得意想不到的效果。但他们没有能力进行深层次的基础理论研究。
    中华医学会副会长、我国著名胸外科专家辛盲龄教授研究了刘氏兄弟的临床效果后，满腔热情地支持他们的工作。近2年来中日友好医院临床研究所在多批动物实验中证实，
  “克癌7851”的平均抑瘤率为48％，最高达70.9％，有37.5％的动物肿瘤消失，病理组织学研究也发现，给药动物的肿瘤组织破坏严重，抑制并减少了癌性腹水，降低了肿瘤发病率。
    近2年，北京中日友好医院用“克癌7851”收治按国际标准分期确诊的各类癌症患者400余例。其中原发性和转移性肺癌218例，有效和显效148例，占67.9％；原发性和转移性肝癌60例，有效和显效39例，占65％；脑部恶性肿瘤16例，有效和显效12例，占75％；其余为消化道等恶性肿瘤，有效和显效者占65％。大部分患者反映，用药后感觉良好，减轻了痛苦，延长了生命。
