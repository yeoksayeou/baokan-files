	Factory Directors and Workers Are One Family
	People's Daily Commentator

	Wholeheartedly relying on the working class is a long-standing important guiding principle of our Party. In response to the tendency to overlook the role of the working class that emerged in social life in the previous period, the Party Central Committee has recently reiterated the importance of wholeheartedly relying on the working class, which is very necessary. However, this raises a question of understanding: what is the relationship between relying on the working class and giving full play to the role of entrepreneurs? Correctly addressing this issue is not only crucial for the completion of the tasks of rectification and deepening reform but also for the stability of enterprises and society. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss this issue.

	Firstly, it should be clear that the working class is a collective concept, including workers in industrial, transportation, construction, and other sectors, as well as those in commerce and the service industry. Under current conditions in China, it also includes intellectuals engaged in scientific research, culture, health, and education. It includes both manual laborers and mental laborers. Modern large-scale production requires not only production workers but also technical personnel and management cadres. Factory directors and managers, as enterprise management cadres, are naturally members of the working class. Wholeheartedly relying on the working class, of course, includes giving full play to the important role of factory directors and managers.

	Factory directors and managers are not only members of the working class but also a core force within it. Everyone knows that the strength of the working class lies in its organizational capacity. Factory directors and managers, as organizers and commanders of enterprise production, enable the working masses to be well organized in large-scale production. In this sense, the Party and the state's reliance on the working class is an important means of achieving this through factory directors and managers. Factory directors and managers have a dual role: they are both the reliance of the Party and the state and the link between the Party and the state and the working masses.

	Factory directors and managers are one family with the workers, but due to different divisions of labor and positions within the enterprise, conflicts may arise between them. To correctly handle these conflicts, factory directors and managers must first pay attention to continuously improving their own qualifications, establish the idea of relying on the broad masses of workers to run the enterprise, pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, and absorb them into management. They must consciously accept the supervision of the working masses and prevent various forms of corruption from infiltrating. For the broad masses of workers, they should establish the idea of consciously obeying management authority. They should see that this is not just about obeying the factory directors and managers as individuals, but is necessary for modern large-scale production. Factory directors and managers are the legal representatives of the enterprise, directly responsible for the operational results of the enterprise, with heavy responsibilities, heavy workloads, and the need for specialized management knowledge and skills. Their labor should be recognized by society, which is beneficial for the growth of management talents, strengthening enterprise management, and improving operational levels. This is in the interest of the state and the entire working class and ultimately in the interest of every worker. The broad masses of workers, of course, have the right to supervise the managers, but they should also understand their difficulties and, for their shortcomings and mistakes, as long as they are not lawless, should start from a good intention and give them enthusiastic help. They should not easily take actions that exacerbate conflicts just because their personal interests are affected.

	Since the reform and opening up, with the emergence of many outstanding entrepreneurs, the slogan has been put forward: to build the enterprise into a "community of common interests" and a "community of shared destiny" for the workers. This is a good proposition, reflecting the essence of socialist enterprises and the relationship of fundamental interests between factory directors, managers, and workers. Many workers deeply feel that the prosperity of the enterprise brings honor, and the decline of the enterprise brings disgrace. Reform has actually deepened the blood relationship between factory directors, managers, and the broad masses of workers. The view that reform will weaken the status and role of the working class is one-sided, and the view that workers do not support the growth of outstanding entrepreneurs is also unfounded.

	Our leading organs, when guiding work, must also clearly establish the idea that factory directors, managers, and workers are one family. When emphasizing the role of managers, they should not belittle the working masses; when emphasizing wholeheartedly relying on the working class, they should not put entrepreneurs in a separate category. China's enterprise reform is progressing through exploration, and in some development stages, specific policies and regulations are inevitably not well-coordinated or complete, thus affecting the coordination of the relationship between managers and producers to a certain extent. For such problems, higher-level leading organs should take the initiative to assume responsibility, summarizing experience and improving work in the spirit of unity and looking forward, and should not push all responsibility onto the enterprise leaders, thus discouraging their enthusiasm. Enterprises need entrepreneurs, and society needs entrepreneurs. We hope that a large number of outstanding talents will go to work in enterprises and build a team of socialist entrepreneurs.

	Brothers working together bring prosperity to the family. This is true for a family and also for an enterprise. Factory directors, managers, and workers, as one family, understanding and caring for each other, working together with one heart and one mind, can not only overcome difficulties on the way forward but also welcome greater development.

    厂长工人一家人
    本报评论员
    全心全意依靠工人阶级，这是我们党一贯的重要指导思想。针对前一阶段在社会生活中出现的忽视工人阶级作用的倾向，党中央最近重新强调全心全意依靠工人阶级，这是十分必要的。但是，这中间遇到了一个认识问题，就是依靠工人阶级和发挥企业家的作用之间是什么关系？正确解决这个问题，不仅关系到治理整顿、深化改革任务的完成，也关系到企业和社会的稳定，因此，有加以讨论的必要。
    首先应当明确，工人阶级是一个整体概念，既包括工业、交通、建筑等产业部门的职工，也包括商业、服务业人员；在我国目前的条件下，还包括从事科研、文化、卫生、教育等工作的知识分子；既包括体力劳动者，也包括脑力劳动者。社会化大生产不仅需要生产工人，也需要技术人员和经营管理干部。厂长、经理作为企业的经营管理干部理所当然是工人阶级的成员，全心全意依靠工人阶级，当然也包括充分发挥厂长、经理的重要作用。
    厂长、经理不仅是工人阶级的成员，而且是工人阶级中的一支骨干力量。大家知道，工人阶级的力量就在于它的组织性。厂长、经理作为企业生产的组织者、指挥者，由于他们的工作，工人群众才能很好地组织在大生产中。从这种意义上说，党和国家对工人阶级的依靠，一个重要的途径就是通过厂长、经理来实现的。厂长、经理一身二任，既是党和国家的依靠力量，又是党和国家联系工人群众的纽带。
    厂长、经理与工人是一家人，但是，由于分工不同，在企业中所处的位置不同，他们之间也会发生一些矛盾。为了正确处理这些矛盾，厂长、经理必须首先注意不断提高自己的素质，必须树立依靠广大职工办好企业的思想，注意听取群众意见，吸收他们参加管理；必须自觉接受工人群众的监督，防止各种腐败现象的侵蚀。对广大职工来说，则要树立自觉服从管理权威的思想。要看到这不只是对厂长、经理个人的服从，而是现代化大生产所必需。厂长、经理是企业的法人代表，对企业的经营后果直接负责，责任重大，工作繁重，而且需要专门的经营管理知识和才能。他们的劳动理应得到社会的承认，这对管理人才的成长，对加强企业管理，提高企业经营水平，都是有利的，是符合国家利益，符合整个工人阶级的利益的，最终也是符合每一个工人的利益的。广大职工当然有监督经营者的权力，但是，也要理解他们的苦衷，对他们的缺点错误，只要不是违法乱纪者，就应从善意出发，给予热情的帮助，千万不要因为触犯了个人的利益，就轻易作出激化矛盾的事来。
    改革开放以来，随着众多优秀企业家的出现，提出了这样一个口号：要把企业建成职工的“利益共同体”、“命运共同体”。应该说，这是一个很好的提法，它体现了社会主义企业的实质，又反映了厂长、经理同工人根本利益一致的关系。许多职工都深切地感到，厂兴同荣，厂衰同辱。改革实际上更加深了厂长、经理与广大职工的血肉关系。那种认为改革会削弱工人阶级地位和作用的看法是片面的，那种认为工人不支持优秀企业家成长的看法，也是没有根据的。
    我们的领导机关，在指导工作的时候，也必须明确厂长、经理和工人是一家人的思想。在强调经营者作用的时候，不要贬低工人群众；在强调全心全意依靠工人阶级的时候，也不要把企业家打入“另册”。我国的企业改革是在探索中前进的，在某些发展阶段上，具体的政策和规定难免有不配套、不完善的地方，因而也在一定程度上影响了经营者与生产者之间关系的协调。对于这类问题，上级领导机关应主动承担责任，本着团结一致向前看的精神，总结经验，改进工作，且不可把一切责任都推到企业领导者身上，以致挫伤了他们的积极性。企业需要企业家，社会需要企业家，我们希望大批优秀的人才到企业去工作，建立一支社会主义的企业家队伍。
    兄弟合作家兴旺。一个家庭如此，一个企业也是如此。厂长、经理与工人作为一家人，互相理解，互相关心，同心同德，共同努力，不仅能克服前进中的困难，而且能迎来更大的发展。
