The political situation in the Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros has undergone changes following the assassination of President Ahmed Abdallah at the end of November. France is intensifying its political, economic, and military intervention in this island country.

The Comoros archipelago consists mainly of four islands, located in the western Indian Ocean between the African continent and Madagascar. It covers an area of 2,235 square kilometers with a population of less than 500,000. At the end of the last century, the Comoros archipelago was invaded and colonized by France. In 1975, the archipelago declared independence, but one of its islands, Mayotte, remains under French administration.

On the night of November 26, the 70-year-old President Abdallah was killed in an attempted coup. According to the constitution, the President of the Supreme Court assumed the role of interim head of state. A presidential guard consisting of over 600 Comoran soldiers serves as the sole armed force controlling the situation on the island. This presidential guard was established in 1978 by Colonel Bob Denard, a French national, and is commanded by him and 30 other European officers.

After the assassination of President Abdallah, the French government accused Denard of interfering in the island's politics as a foreign mercenary. In a statement on December 2, the French Foreign Ministry said, "A group of armed individuals played a role disproportionate to the normal functioning of this country."

The French government demanded that Denard leave Comoros immediately, allowing the island's "people to exercise their right to self-determination." After this demand was rejected, on December 6, the French government announced the suspension of economic aid to the island and the halt of the dispatch of French technical assistance personnel. The South African government, which has important economic ties with Comoros, also announced similar measures.

Subsequently, France, citing the unclear political situation on the island, dispatched four French warships to the waters of Comoros "to gather information." The French military stated that the purpose of this action was to protect and repatriate the 1,600 French citizens on the island. President Mitterrand said at a French cabinet meeting this week, "France has no intention of intervening militarily in Comoros, but must be responsible for the safety of its citizens on the island."

On December 13, French warships set sail from Mayotte Island to patrol the waters around the other three islands of Comoros. The fleet commander claimed this was a "show of force." On the evening of December 14, Denard was forced to agree to leave the island.

Early this morning, French troops began direct intervention in Comoros. Five "Puma" helicopters and several military transport planes carried over 200 marine paratroopers to land in the capital, Moroni. A few hours later, Colonel Denard and other foreign officers left the island on a South African military aircraft bound for South Africa. The French paratroopers took control of the presidential guard, and the situation on the island was brought under French military control.

That afternoon, the French Foreign Ministry issued a statement confirming the above information. The statement said, "France hopes that the people of Comoros can soon exercise their basic rights and make choices in a free and democratic manner through consultation." However, public opinion noted that under the control of French troops, what kind of "choices" the people of Comoros can make remains to be seen.

### 科摩罗政局与法国的干预

    科摩罗政局与法国的干预
    新华社记者　沈孝泉
    印度洋岛国科摩罗总统艾哈迈德·阿卜杜拉11月底遇害之后，这个国家的政局发生变化。法国正在政治、经济和军事方面加紧对这个岛国进行干预。
    科摩罗群岛主要有4岛组成，位于印度洋西部，介于非洲大陆与马达加斯加岛之间，面积2235平方公里，人口不足50万。上个世纪末，科摩罗群岛被法国侵占沦为殖民地。1975年这个群岛宣布独立，而群岛之一的马约特岛仍由法国管辖。
    今年11月26日深夜，70岁的总统阿
  卜杜拉在一次未遂的兵变中被杀害。根据宪法，最高法院院长担任了临时国家元首。一支由600多名科摩罗士兵组成的总统卫队作为唯一的武装力量控制科岛局势。这支总统卫队是原籍法国的德纳尔上校于1978年组建的，并由他本人和另外30名欧洲籍军官指挥。
    阿卜杜拉总统遇害后，法国政府指责德纳尔作为外国雇佣军人员干预科岛政局。法国外交部在12月2日的一项公报中说，“一批武装人员扮演了同这个国家的正常运转不相称的角色”。
    法国政府要求德纳尔迅速离开科摩
  罗，由该岛“人民行使自决权利”。在这一要求遭到拒绝后，12月6日法国政府宣布中止对科岛提供的经济援助，同时停止派遣法国技术援助人员。与科摩罗有重要经济关系的南非政权也宣布了同样的措施。
    随后，法国以该岛政局不明朗为由，派出4艘法国军舰开赴科摩罗海域“探情”。法国军方称，这个行动的目的是保护和遣返科岛上的1600名法国侨民。密特朗总统在本周法国内阁会议上说，“法国无意武装干涉科摩罗，但必须对该岛的侨民安全负责”。
    12月13日，法国军舰从马约特岛开航前往科摩罗其他三岛海域武装巡逻。舰队指挥人员声称这是一次“炫耀武力的行动”。12月14日晚，德纳尔被迫表示同意离开科岛。
    今天凌晨，法军开始对科摩罗进行直接干预。五架“美洲狮”直升机和数架军用运输机运载着200多名海军伞兵部队在首都莫罗尼登陆。数小时后，德纳尔上校和其他外籍军官乘南非军用飞机离开科岛前往南非。法国伞兵部队接管了总统卫队的指挥，科岛局势控制在法国军队手中。
      当天下午，法国外交部发表声明证实了以上的消息。声明说，“法国希望科摩罗人民尽快能够在自由民主协商中履行其基本权利并做出选择。”但是舆论界注意到，在法国军队的控制下，科摩罗人民能够做出什么样的“选择”，尚需由事实做出回答。（新华社巴黎12月15日电）
