The watercolor exhibition by Professor Hua Yunchu has finally opened at the National Art Museum of China. On this day, dozens of old classmates in Beijing, all over fifty, came to congratulate him. Since graduating from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1954, it has been thirty-five years, and we had never seen him or his paintings before. Suddenly entering Hua Yunchu's meticulously constructed artistic palace, we were both surprised and delighted. I remember a few years ago, in the preface to a painting exhibition by our peers, there was such a monologue: the elders felt sorry for us, saying we were chickens that had not hatched; the younger generation was not satisfied with us, saying we were pickled eggs, what a pity! Hua Yunchu's monologue, however, is regardless of the elders' and the younger generation's praise and criticism, I am content with myself, the key is to strive and persevere.

In the history of art, there are many painters who have achieved outstanding results by changing their style in their later years, but he is still in his prime. From the eighty-plus watercolor paintings on display, he has changed his style several times, never confined to one's own perspective and adhering to old rules, always concentrating on new discoveries and achievements in the process of practice. Emotional exploration, serious practice, this is the reason why he has unique skills and outstanding achievements in watercolor painting creation.

Hua Yunchu was a sprinter in his student days, and he was used to sprinting towards the finish line in the last few seconds. I often have this moving memory in my mind, which gives us not only admiration but also spiritual encouragement. Although he is sixty years old, his passion for art is as strong as ever, with a mighty spirit, and he said that after this exhibition, he will step onto a new starting line.

Life is short, how to make every artistic creation period of each artist leave a record of achievements worth recording, and not become a blank in life, this is not an easy task, and its fulfillment requires a great deal of effort. Hua Yunchu has paid thirty-five years of hard work, and he is still teaching at Wuhan University of Technology's School of Architecture. As a professor and a painter, his hard work is even more imaginable. He has shed sweat on the bumpy journey and presented such wonderful art to people, which is precious. Perhaps this is the reason for our heartfelt congratulations.

    艺术生命的冲刺
    ——华纫秋教授水彩画展观感
    袁运甫
    纫秋的水彩画展终于在中国美术馆开幕了，这一天在北京的好几十位年过半百的老同学都来祝贺他。自一九五四年在中央美术学院毕业分手至今，足足三十五个年头了，也从未见过其人其画，一下子进入纫秋如此精心构筑的艺术之宫，不免惊喜而又唐突。记得几年前在一次同龄人的画展前言里见过这样的独白：先生对我们感到惋惜，说我们是没有出壳的鸡；后生对我们不满意，说我们是腌过的蛋，难那！纫秋的独白却是不管先生后生的褒贬，我自好然为之，贵在奋进与持恒。
    美术史上诸如衰年变法并取得杰出成就的画家不乏其人，但他尚属壮年，从展出的八十余幅水彩画中，却几易其法从不囿于管见而墨守陈规，总是凝聚着实践过程中的新发现和新成果，动情的探索，严肃的实践，这正是他在水彩画创作中独具匠心并取得突出成绩的原因。
    纫秋学生时代就是短跑健将，他惯于在最后几秒钟向终点冲刺，我常在脑海里出现这一动人的记忆，它给予我们不仅仅是感佩，而是一种精神上的激励。他虽然是六十岁的人了，但对艺术的狂盛精力犹不减当年，浩气磅礴，还说这次展览之后，又将步入新的起跑线了。
    人生几何，如何使每一位艺术家的各个创作历程都留下值得作为记录的成绩，而不至于是生命的一段空白，这却并非易事，其充实固然要付出极大代价的。纫秋付出了三十五年的辛勤耕耘，还在武汉工业大学建筑系任教，教授兼画家其辛勤更可想而知了。他把汗水洒在坎坷的历程并向人们奉献出如此美妙的艺术，这是可贵的。也许这就是我们为之庆贺的由衷之情。
