A batch of high-rise buildings have been constructed along the 1,166-kilometer stretch of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from Lhasa to Golmud, adding color and charm to the road. The buildings in the military supply stations of Lhasa, Damxung, Anduo, Tanggula, Tuotuohe, Naqu, and Golmud were completed this year after three years of arduous construction, funded by the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army.

The soldiers stationed along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway have bid farewell to their old "cold palaces" and "huts." These new buildings are three to five stories high, equipped with heating and oxygen supply systems. Inside, there are recreation rooms, libraries, television rooms, and conference rooms.
