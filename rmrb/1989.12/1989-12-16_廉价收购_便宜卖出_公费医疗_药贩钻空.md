Jiangsu Province Xuzhou City Social and Economic Investigation Team Wei Ping writes: “Got medicine? Sell it to us!” Every day, dozens of drug peddlers roam the streets of Xuzhou City, calling out to buy medicines at extremely low prices. They then sell these medicines to local individual practitioners at prices lower than the state-run wholesale prices. Even packaged medicines can be sold directly to pharmacies. According to investigations, each drug peddler can earn an average of 800 yuan in gross profit per month, with some earning over 1500 yuan. Even the lowest earnings can cover all living expenses while out on the road. Each trip, lasting 5-7 days, is enough to return with a full load.

Whose wealth are these drug peddlers amassing? “Public healthcare.”

    廉价收购　便宜卖出
    公费医疗　药贩钻空
    江苏省徐州市社会经济调查队韦平来信：“有药拿来卖！”徐州市区每日有数十余名收购药品的贩子走街串巷地吆喝着。他们以极其低廉的价格收进，然后再以低于国营批发价卖给当地的个体行医户，包装好的还可以直接卖给药店。据调查，每个药贩子平均每月毛收益达800元，多则可达1500元以上。最少的收入也能维持出门在外的一切生活开销，每次出门收购5—7天就可以满载而归了。
    药贩子都发谁的财？“公费医疗”。
