The "Nankai Cup" National Amateur Drama and Sketch Invitational Competition recently concluded, showcasing the current level of amateur drama creation among the masses. Across the country, tens of thousands of workers, cadres, students, and soldiers have taken to the stage to display their talents. The breadth of themes, depth of ideas, innovative stage techniques, and lively performances of the competing works have earned praise from professional theater practitioners in attendance. People were delighted to find that drama is no longer the domain of a few lone warriors. A vibrant and talented amateur theater troupe has emerged, surrounded by countless drama enthusiasts. Drama has returned to the people, becoming a social endeavor in which the masses can participate. The introduction of modern television media has enabled drama sketches to truly reach society and every household. Its profound impact will be seen in the development of mass culture and theater culture in the future.

The 14 finalists were selected from over a thousand entries, truly a selection of the best. Jiangsu Province's "Fulfillment" topped the list with its fresh and poetic charm. Interestingly, it was also the shortest performance among all entries, lasting only about 6 minutes, with the youngest performer being just 5 years old. A retired mayor sits in a park, while a gardener's granddaughter waters flowers nearby. A falling leaf sparks a conversation, and the old and young engage in a heart-to-heart talk. What seems like a casual scene from daily life conveys a profound human condition. "Fulfillment" is a poem on stage, a "fairy tale" for adults. It reflects the complexities of life through a child's eyes, offering a fresh aesthetic experience. "Autumn Leaves Fall Again," which shared the top prize, is a military amateur creation. With the intensity of "heavy strings clattering like a sudden rain" and a concise stage rhythm, it tells a tragic story spanning half a century. When the two elderly characters, to settle a debt from 50 years ago, impose the same tragedy on their respective grandchildren, and then, in their ecstasy, sit on the ground singing a clapping song, the emotional impact is something many grand productions fail to achieve. The play's efforts in enriching stage techniques are also commendable. The two characters "flashback" to 50 years ago on stage, perfectly combining the assumed time and space of the stage with the alienation effect, showcasing the extraordinary artistic creativity of the amateur director. Other outstanding works include Henan Province's "Selling Pigs," which, in just over ten minutes, created an unforgettable character. The actor playing the pig seller vividly portrayed the old man's willingness to compromise for immediate gain. When the pig seller, in frustration, pushes away the painter who stands up for him and surrenders to the livestock purchaser who bullies him with power, the audience can't help but laugh and ponder... Among the finalists, comedies held a significant share and reached a high standard. Shaanxi's "Rice and Red Sorghum" and "Haircut," Liaoning's "Guerrillas," and Tianjin's "Gourmet" have different sources and styles but all adhere to the comedic principle that humor comes from character, using realistic character portrayals to praise and criticize the beauty and ugliness of life, bringing laughter to the audience. Due to space limitations, not all award-winning works can be discussed. However, the following evaluation may be fair: although none are perfect, and there are differences in ranking, the overall level presented on stage during the finals is in no way inferior to professional performances. Moreover, each work contributes its unique innovations to the development of sketch art.

    记戏剧的美重返民间
    ——“南开杯”全国业余话剧小品邀请赛有感
    凌申
    不久前降下帷幕的“南开杯”全国业余话剧小品邀请赛集中展示了目前群众业余话剧创作的水平。在祖国各地，数以万计的工人、干部、学生和解放军指战员登上舞台，一展才华。参赛剧目的题材之广泛、立意之深邃、舞台表现手段之新颖、表演之生动，让到会观摩的专业戏剧工作者称赞。人们惊喜地发现，话剧不再是少数人孤军奋战的事情了。人才济济、生气勃勃的业余戏剧队伍已经形成，在他们身边，又有千千万万关心戏剧、热爱戏剧的群众。话剧重又回到民间，成为群众亲身参与的社会事业。现代化电视传播媒介的介入，使得话剧小品真正走向社会，走向千家万户。其深远影响将在群众文化、戏剧文化今后的发展中显露出来。
    进入决赛的14个剧目是从上千个参赛剧目中遴选出来的，称得上披沙拣金，精采纷呈。江苏省的《充实》以清新、隽永的诗意名列榜首。有趣的是，它还是所有参赛剧目中演出时间最短的剧目，只6分多钟，演员最小的仅5岁。离休的老市长在公园里闲坐，花匠的小孙女在一旁浇花，由一片落叶引出话题，这一老一少唠起了家常。仿佛是信手拈来的生活场景，却传递了耐人咀嚼的人生状态。《充实》是舞台上的诗，是写给成年人的“童话”。它用儿童的眼光折射驳杂的人生，给人以全新的审美感受。和《充实》并列一等奖的《又是秋叶飘落时》是部队的业余创作。它以“大弦嘈嘈如急雨”的气势和简练明快的舞台节奏，讲叙了一个跨越半个世纪的悲剧故事。戏的结尾，当两位老人为了却50年前的情债，把同样的悲剧强加在各自的孙男孙女之后，乐极忘形，坐在地上唱起拍手歌时，所产生的情感冲击力是很多大戏不曾达到的。这出戏在丰富舞台表现手段方面的努力也是值得称道的。两位剧中人当众“闪回”到50年前，实现了舞台时空的假定性和间离效果的完满结合，由此看出业余导演不寻常的艺术创造力。上乘之作还有河南省的《卖猪》，它在十几分钟的时间里塑造了一个让观众忘不了的人物。饰演卖猪老汉的演员把老汉为了眼前利益委屈求全的心态演活了。当卖猪老汉气恼地推开为他打抱不平的画家，向依仗权力欺凌自己的生猪收购员举手“投降”时，观众忍俊不禁而又思绪重重……在决赛剧目中，喜剧占了相当的比重并且达到了相当的水平。陕西的《大米与红高粱》和《剃头》、辽宁的《游击队》、天津的《品尝家》取材不同，风格各异，却都能循着喜剧性源于人物性格的喜剧原则，凭着实实在在的人物性格刻画，褒贬生活的美丑，给观众笑的快乐。篇幅所限，不能对获奖剧目一一论及。但我想如下的评价可能是公允的：尽管都没能尽善尽美，尽管在名次上有高下之分，但决赛时呈现在舞台上的总体水平决不逊于专业。而且每个剧目都能对小品艺术的开拓贡献出各自的新意。
