The draw for the final round of the World Cup football tournament has, as usual, sparked strong reactions in the international football community. Immediately, those involved are either delighted or worried, while outsiders have varying opinions.

Brazil's Football Community Feels Good About Themselves
Members of Brazil's football community are satisfied with the draw results and generally believe that, barring any unexpected events, Brazil will have no problem advancing from the group stage.

The 39-year-old coach of the Brazilian team, Lazaroni, said that among the three opponents in their group, the Costa Rica team poses no threat to Brazil's advancement. The playing styles of Sweden and Scotland are both modern, especially Sweden's strong defense and effective counterattacks, which should not be underestimated. However, Lazaroni is confident about Brazil's chances of advancing.

The football legend Pelé is optimistic about Brazil's prospects. He said that being grouped with Sweden, Scotland, and Costa Rica is fortunate, with many favorable conditions, and the chances of advancing are greater than being in the same group as Argentina. However, he cautioned that Brazil should not underestimate their opponents. Except for Costa Rica, both Sweden and Scotland are strong teams and need to be taken seriously.

Brazil's forward and world-class player, Careca, who currently plays for Napoli in Italy, believes that Brazil is currently in a period of rising performance. He thinks that Brazil's advancement to the second round will not be difficult with effort.

Brazil's goalkeeper Taffarel expressed satisfaction upon learning the draw results. He told the media, "Brazil is lucky, and this will be a good opportunity for Brazil to win their fourth title."

Spanish Coach Confident in Group Stage Advancement
The Spanish team is scheduled to play a friendly match against Switzerland on December 13th to prepare for the World Cup. After that, Spain will play friendly matches against Czechoslovakia and Austria, both of whom have already qualified for the World Cup, in February and March of next year.

Spanish coach Luis Suárez commented on the World Cup final draw results, saying that Spain is confident in competing with Uruguay, Belgium, and South Korea for a spot in the next round. He said, "Although we will face difficulties, we are still confident in advancing to the second round."

Colombia Coach Worried
Colombia's coach, Francisco Maturana, said that Colombia's opponents are all strong, and he is not optimistic about their chances of advancing. However, he added that his current mood is calm because Colombia has already entered the final round of the 14th World Cup.

Maturana said that Colombia's goal in participating in the Italian World Cup is clear: their team is not just filling a spot but aims to establish Colombia's football image on the green field.

Maturana said that there is still time before the World Cup, and they can strengthen their preparations to improve the team. "I will meet with the leaders of the Colombian Football Association to study and formulate the training path that the national team will follow."

Beckenbauer Satisfied with the Draw Results
West Germany's national football team manager, Franz Beckenbauer, said, "We are satisfied with this draw result because some groups have stronger lineups." He believes that Group F, which includes England and the Netherlands, and Group B, which includes Argentina and the Soviet Union, are the groups with the strongest teams.

Beckenbauer commented on the other three teams in West Germany's Group D. He believes that Yugoslavia has the strongest technical team in years, with players like Stojkovic and Savicevic. He thinks that the United Arab Emirates is good at defense, and he is not familiar with Colombia but plans to purchase videos of the South American Championship and watch Colombia's matches in Europe next year.

    世界足球大赛抽签后反响热烈
    和以往一样，世界杯足球赛决赛阶段分组抽签之后，立刻在国际足球界引起强烈反响，一时间当事者或喜或忧，局外人见仁见智。
      巴西足球界自我感觉良好
    巴西足球界人士对抽签分组情况感到满意，普遍认为，巴西队在小组赛中如不出现意外，出线不会有问题。
    39岁的巴西队教练拉萨洛尼说，同组的3个对手中哥斯达黎加队对巴西队出线不构成任何威胁，瑞典和苏格兰两支球队的踢法均属现代足球流派，特别是瑞典队防守好，反击很具威胁，不能小视，要认真对付才行。但是，拉萨洛尼对巴西队出线抱有信心。
    球王贝利看好巴西队。他说，巴西队与瑞典队、苏格兰队和哥斯达黎加队分在一起，很幸运，有利条件多，与阿根廷队相比，小组出线希望大。但是他提醒说，巴西队不能有任何轻敌的心理，除哥斯达黎加队外，瑞典队和苏格兰队的水平都不弱，需要认真对付。
    巴西队前锋、现效力意大利那不勒斯队的世界级球星卡雷卡认为，巴西队目前正处在水平日趋上升的时期，巴西队通过努力进入第二轮比赛不会有很大的困难。
    巴西队守门员塔法莱尔，在得知抽签分组的消息后显示出满意的心情，他对报界说，巴西队很幸运，这将是巴西队争取第四次捧杯的良机。
    西班牙教头对小组出线信心十足
    西班牙队为备战世界杯足球赛定于13日同瑞士队进行一场热身赛。在此之后，西班牙队将于明年2月和3月同已获得世界杯足球赛出线权的捷克斯洛伐克队和奥地利队各进行一场友谊赛。
    西班牙队教练路易斯·苏亚雷斯在谈到世界杯决赛圈的分组结果时说，西班牙队对同乌拉圭、比利时和南朝鲜队争夺小组出线赛充满信心。他说，尽管我们会遇到困难，我们仍然能够进入第二轮比赛。
        哥伦比亚教练忧上心头
    哥伦比亚队弗·马图拉纳教练说，哥伦比亚队的对手都很强硬，我们对出线前景不抱乐观态度。但他又说，无论如何，我目前的心情很平静，因为我们毕竟已步入第十四届世界杯足球赛的决赛行列。
    马图拉纳教练说，我们参加意大利世界杯足球赛的目的非常清楚，即我们的球队不是滥竽充数，而是去确立哥伦比亚足球在绿茵赛场上的形象。
    马图拉纳教练说，距世界杯足球大赛还有一段时间，我们可以加强准备使其球队得到新的提高。“我将与哥伦比亚足协领导人进行会晤，研究和制订出国家足球队将要遵循的训练道路。”
        贝肯鲍尔对抽签结果满意
    西德国家足球队领队贝肯鲍尔发表谈话说，“我们对这种抽签结果感到满意，因为有的组的阵容更强。”他认为包括英格兰、荷兰在内的F组和阿根廷队、苏联队所在的B组，都是强队较多的小组。
    贝肯鲍尔对西德所在的D组其余3个队发表了看法。他认为南斯拉夫队在技术上是多年来最强的，它拥有斯托伊罗维奇和萨维谢维奇这样的“超级技师”。他认为阿拉伯联合酋长国队善于防守，他对哥伦比亚队还缺乏了解，但他表示要购买南美足球锦标赛录像带和观看哥队明年来欧的比赛。
