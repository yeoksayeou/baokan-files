Soviet leader Gorbachev returned to Moscow late on the 3rd after participating in a two-day informal summit with the American leader in Malta.

Before departing from Malta, Gorbachev spoke to Soviet television, saying that this meeting "has created good conditions for achieving specific results in many areas in the future." The meeting greatly promoted the negotiations on conventional weapons in Vienna, and significant breakthroughs are expected in this area. He said that regarding chemical weapons, many aspects of the previous American stance had left the Soviet Union puzzled, but this time the American side presented some new and particularly important views, so it can be said that progress will be made.

He particularly mentioned that the American president showed concern for the first time about economic cooperation with the Soviet Union.

The Soviet leader also said that although the Cold War has basically ended, many remnants of that era still linger in the attitudes and foreign activities of some individual countries, and some of the methods from that time continue to exist. He said that there are still forces that want to rebuild the new Europe and the new world on the mechanisms produced during the Cold War era. But he believes that the methods of the Cold War have already failed.

    结束苏美首脑非正式会晤
    戈尔巴乔夫回到莫斯科
    新华社莫斯科12月3日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在参加了为期两天的苏美首脑非正式会晤后，3日晚从马耳他回到莫斯科。
    戈尔巴乔夫在飞离马耳他之前向苏联电视台发表谈话说，这次会晤“为今后在许多方面取得具体成果创造着良好前提”。会晤极大地推动了维也纳常规武器的谈判，这方面可望有较大的突破。他说，关于化学武器，过去美国立场中的许多东西使苏联困惑不解，这次美国方面陈述了某些新的特别重要的看法，因此可说事情将向前推进。
    他特别提到美国总统首次对同苏联进行经济合作表现出关切心情。
    苏联领导人还说，“冷战”虽然已基本结束，但那个时期的许多东西仍然在个别国家的态度和对外活动中残留着，那个时代的一些手段也还继续存在。他说，还有这样的势力，这种势力希望把新的欧洲和新的世界改建在“冷战”年代产生的机制基础上。但他认为“冷战”方法已经遭到失败。
