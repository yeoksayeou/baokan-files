The chairman of the China Cathode Ray Tube Industry Association, Yin Zong'en, recently told a reporter that the domestic production capacity of black-and-white picture tubes has far exceeded market demand, and it is not advisable for various regions to blindly expand production lines. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 50 to 60 black-and-white picture tube production enterprises nationwide, with a total annual production capacity of about 19 million units. However, the domestic market demand for the next few years will remain at around 10 to 11 million units, and production capacity has already shown significant excess.
