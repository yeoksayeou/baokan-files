Modern architecture requires ceilings to form specific spatial shapes and conceal an increasing number of pipelines, thus setting very high standards for ceilings. Currently, the commonly used ceilings on the market are not convenient for the maintenance of concealed facilities.

The movable metal ceiling, jointly developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Architectural Design and the Yongjia Architectural Decoration Factory in Zhejiang, has undergone small-scale production and partial use, proving that it has met all the specified indicators and is ready for widespread application. Its development and production have filled a gap in China's building materials industry.
