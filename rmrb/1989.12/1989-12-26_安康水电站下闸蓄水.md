    The Ankang Hydropower Station, a major national project and the largest hydropower hub on the Han River, has successfully begun water storage.

    The Ankang Hydropower Station is located upstream on the Han River in the western part of Ankang City. It has a total installed capacity of 800,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation capacity of 2.8 billion kilowatt-hours. The reservoir has a total capacity of 2.58 billion cubic meters. The first generating unit will officially start power generation in the third quarter of next year, providing a strong power supply to the Shaanxi and Northwest power grids. Construction of the power station began in 1978 and took 11 years to complete. The construction task was undertaken by more than 14,000 cadres, workers, and technical personnel from the Third Hydropower Bureau.
