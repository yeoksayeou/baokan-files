In the friendly neighboring country of Pakistan, people often use the majesty of the Karakoram Mountains to praise the friendship between China and Pakistan. Indeed, this metaphor is not an exaggeration.

During my stay in Islamabad, in the midst of my busy work schedule, I enjoyed taking walks in the Shakarparian Hill Park. In 1959, the Pakistani cabinet held a meeting on this hilltop and passed a resolution to build a new capital – Islamabad. Later, a small and elegant park was built on the site of the meeting. At the eastern end of the park, there is a grassy area enclosed by a hedge of cypress trees, specifically designated for visiting leaders from various countries to plant trees as a memento. In 1964, our beloved Premier Zhou Enlai planted a tree there during his visit to Pakistan. Later, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Li Xiannian, and other Chinese leaders also planted trees during their visits. In this small hilltop park, Chinese leaders planted the most trees, a total of five. This demonstrated the close and friendly relationship between China and Pakistan.

Every time I walked in the hilltop park, I saw visitors from all over Pakistan taking photos in front of these trees. Once, I saw an old gardener watering the tree planted by Premier Zhou. I struck up a conversation with him. He excitedly told me that he had been working there for 25 years. When the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai planted this tree, he was the one assisting by holding the sapling, handing Zhou the shovel and watering can, and helping to cover the roots with soil. He said, "Premier Zhou, after planting the tree, told the host, 'May this tree grow as strong as the friendship between our two peoples.' For more than twenty years, this old gardener has diligently watered, fertilized, pruned, and cared for this tree. Now, the tree is tall and lush, and the friendship between China and Pakistan has grown stronger with each passing day. The old gardener said with deep emotion, 'Premier Zhou's wish has come true.'"

Those who have worked in Pakistan share a common feeling: the Pakistani people have a special affection for the Chinese people. In March 1986, I was invited to the village of Paghwanwala to attend the opening ceremony of the "Sino-Pakistani Friendship Library." This is a remote village in Punjab, about 200 kilometers from the historic city of Lahore. A young man named Lodhi, to promote Sino-Pakistani friendship, started a library at his own expense, specifically displaying and lending books and periodicals about China, naming it the "Sino-Pakistani Friendship Library." On the day we arrived, Lodhi and the villagers built an archway at the village entrance using branches and flowers, and they placed garlands around our necks. Hundreds of villagers, students, and children shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!" and "Long live the People's Republic of China!" We were deeply moved. The Pakistani people are devout Muslims, and women wear veils, with the inner chambers strictly off-limits to outsiders. However, Lodhi's nearly 80-year-old mother specially invited me into the inner chamber, following local customs by placing her hand on my head and blessing me.

In Pakistan, the number of people reading books about China and listening to China Radio International's Urdu, English, and Pashto broadcasts is increasing. There are more than 100 "Beijing Radio Listeners' Clubs" of considerable size across the country. These clubs often hold exhibitions about China and organize discussions, lectures, or poetry recitals about China.

On October 1, 1984, the "Beijing Radio Listeners' Club" in Sargodha held a book exhibition to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of New China. About 500 club members attended, and many praised China's construction achievements and correct foreign policy, singing the praises of Sino-Pakistani friendship. Among them was a blind man wearing dark glasses named Asghar. He lost his sight at a young age but, with extraordinary willpower, completed all his studies from primary school to university, earning a Ph.D. in English literature from Oxford University with outstanding results. He is now a professor in the English department at Sargodha Government College. In his speech, he said, "Every Pakistani loves China not only because it always helps us in our most difficult times. New China, with its 35-year glorious history, has proven to us that it is not a country that seeks its own private interests at the expense of others. It always helps us with the hope that we will become self-reliant as soon as possible. Moreover, we admire China because it advocates and actively practices the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, never bullying the weak or the small. It is for this reason that these two neighboring countries with different social systems and ideologies get along so harmoniously, and Sino-Pakistani friendship is so admirable and exemplary."

His speech was met with a long, enthusiastic round of applause. The applause still echoes in my ears.

    美好的回忆
    ——中巴友谊二三事
    王益友
    在友好邻邦巴基斯坦，人们总爱用喀喇昆仑山的崇高来赞颂中国和巴基斯坦两国的友谊，的确，这种比喻是并不过分的。
    客居伊斯兰堡的几年当中，在紧张工作之余，我最喜爱到伊斯兰堡的夏克帕里安小山公园散步。1959年，巴基斯坦当时的内阁曾在这个小山顶上举行会议，通过了建设新首都——伊斯兰堡的决议。后来，就在当年开会的地方修建了一个小巧玲珑的山顶公园。公园的东端，有一块松柏篱笆围起的草坪，专供来访的各国领导人栽树留念。1964年，我们敬爱的周恩来总理访巴时就在那里栽下一棵乌桕树，后来，刘少奇主席、李先念主席及中国其他领导人访巴时都亲手栽种树木。在这个小小的山顶公园里，中国领导人所栽种的树最多，有5棵。这显示了中国和巴基斯坦之间亲密的友好关系。
    我每次在山顶公园散步时，都看到来自巴基斯坦全国各地的游人在这些树前摄影留念。有一次，我见到一位老园丁正在周总理栽种的乌桕树旁浇水，便同他攀谈起来。他兴奋地告诉我，他在这里已工作25年了。当年中国总理周恩来栽这棵树时，正是他在一旁扶着树苗，给周总理递铲子和喷水壶，并帮着培土的。他说，周总理栽完树曾对主人说：“愿这棵树像我们两国人民的友谊一样茁壮成长。”二十几年来，这位老园丁一直兢兢业业地给这棵树浇水、培土、施肥、剪枝。如今，这棵乌桕树已经树干挺拔，枝繁叶茂，中巴友谊也与日俱增。老园丁深情地说：“周总理的愿望实现了。”
    在巴基斯坦工作过的中国人有一个共同的感受，就是巴基斯坦人民对中国人民有着一种特殊的友好感情。1986年3月，我应邀到帕格坦瓦拉村参加那里的“巴中友谊图书馆”开馆剪彩仪式。这是旁遮普的一个偏僻农村，距历史名城拉合尔200公里。村里有一位名叫劳梯的年轻人，为了促进中巴友好，他自费办起了一个图书馆，专门陈列并借阅介绍中国情况的书籍和报刊，取名“巴中友谊图书馆”。我们到达的那一天，劳梯先生和村民们在村口用树枝和鲜花搭起一座彩门，并且给我们戴上了花环，数百名村民、学生和儿童高呼着“巴中友谊万岁！”“人民中国万岁！”等口号，我们深为感动。巴基斯坦人笃信伊斯兰教，妇女戴面纱，闺阃更是不许外人涉足。劳梯年近古稀的母亲却特地将我邀入内室，按当地习惯用手抚摸我的头顶，给我祝福。
    在巴基斯坦，阅读介绍中国的书籍和收听中国国际广播电台乌尔都语、英语和普什图语节目的人越来越多。全国各地有100多个有相当规模的“北京电台听众俱乐部”。这些俱乐部经常举办有关中国的展览会，还组织关于中国的讨论会、演讲会或诗歌朗诵会。
    1984年10月的一天，萨尔戈塔城“北京电台听众俱乐部”为庆祝新中国成立35周年举办了中国图书展览会，有500名俱乐部成员出席，许多人赞扬中国的建设成就和正确的外交政策，歌颂巴中友谊。其中有一位戴墨镜的盲人，名叫阿斯迦尔。他自幼双目失明，却以非凡的毅力完成了从小学到大学的全部学业，并以出色的成绩获得了牛津大学英文文学博士学位，现在萨尔戈塔政府学院英文系任教授。他在讲话中说：“我们每一个巴基斯坦人之所以对中国十分热爱，并不仅仅因为她总是在我们最困难的时刻帮助我们。新中国以其35年的光辉历程向我们证明：她不是一个以牺牲别国利益而谋求自己民族私利的国家。她总怀着希望我们尽快自力更生的天使般的心愿帮助我们。不仅如此，我们钦佩中国，还因为她倡导并积极奉行和平共处五项原则，从不以大欺小，以强欺弱。正因为如此，我们这两个社会制度和意识形态不同的邻国才相处得这样和睦，巴中友谊才这样令人羡慕，成为典范。”
    他的讲话博得了全场长时间的热烈掌声。这掌声至今仍在我耳边萦回。
