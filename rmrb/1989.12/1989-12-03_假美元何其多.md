The proliferation of counterfeit dollars is a serious issue. A recent American magazine warned, "Be cautious when you receive a $10 bill or higher denomination. It might be counterfeit!" This is not an exaggeration. Last July, a sanitation worker in New York's Bronx district found bundles of "freshly printed" notes totaling $18 million while cleaning trash bags. After confirming the notes were counterfeit, authorities followed the trail and arrested 85 suspects, including the ringleader Francisco Scocozza, across the United States. This was the largest counterfeit currency operation ever busted in U.S. history. However, the group had already produced $100 million in counterfeit bills over two years, much of which had already circulated. The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for investigating and identifying counterfeit currency, seized $122 million in counterfeit bills in the 1988 fiscal year and $88 million this year. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The agency estimates that $10 billion in counterfeit dollars are produced annually within the U.S., with another $10 billion coming from abroad.

In theory, counterfeiting U.S. dollars is extremely difficult. All U.S. currency is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., and must go through 65 complex, independent procedures. All printing plates are hand-engraved, with each engraver responsible for only a small part. The paper used for printing, which contains 75% cotton and 25% linen and is embedded with blue and red synthetic fibers, is produced exclusively by the Crane Company in Massachusetts. The printing process involves a combination of intaglio and letterpress printing, with a highly secret ink formula. However, counterfeiters often use simple tricks to deceive.

From known cases, some criminals invest less than $10,000 to set up a "home printing press," using photography, aluminum plates, and offset printing. Some printing shop owners or employees simply use existing equipment to print counterfeit bills during off-hours or holidays. Others simply bleach the denomination off a $1 bill and replace it with $20, $50, or $100. Since U.S. bills of different denominations have the same size and color, except for the portrait, this method is relatively easy.

Among the various counterfeit currency operations, several trends are causing headaches for U.S. authorities. First, the scale of operations is increasing. A few years ago, a group printing a few hundred million dollars was rare; now, it's common to see operations worth billions. More people are involved, and the scope is broader.

Second, the methods of operation are becoming more diverse. This year in July, John McCauley was arrested in South Carolina for using a Canon color laser copier worth only $50,000 to print $800,000 in counterfeit U.S. and Canadian currency. As color copying technology advances and prices drop, this problem is expected to worsen.

Third, criminal activities have extended beyond cash to other forms of currency. Last October, authorities in Florida seized $39 million in counterfeit traveler's checks alone. Additionally, credit cards, bank drafts, and even store discount coupons have become targets for counterfeiting.

Furthermore, the internationalization of counterfeit U.S. dollars is becoming more severe. In 1988, countries around the world seized $125 million in counterfeit U.S. dollars. Of the counterfeit currency seized in the U.S., 34% came from abroad, with a significant portion from Latin America. In Europe, Italy and West Germany have both caught criminal gangs printing thousands of millions of dollars, with such high-quality counterfeits that even FBI agents assisting in the investigation had difficulty distinguishing them from real bills. The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs reported breaking up 326 cases of counterfeit rubles and dollars between 1986 and 1988. In Asia, large quantities of counterfeit $100 bills are also circulating. The Philippines destroyed a counterfeiting operation in the suburbs of Manila this year. Some Middle Eastern countries have also discovered counterfeit U.S. dollars.

According to Secret Service officials, the motive behind counterfeiting U.S. dollars is primarily due to the dollar's widespread international circulation and ease of disposal, as well as the rampant drug crime. The U.S. is the largest market for drugs, with most transactions conducted in cash and high profits. Desperate drug dealers either set up their own printing presses to produce counterfeit dollars or buy counterfeit bills at 20-30% below face value to conduct drug transactions.

Facing the rampant counterfeiting, U.S. authorities are tightening investigations and prevention efforts but have no other effective strategies. The Secret Service, with nearly 2,000 employees, has established offices in major cities worldwide. In the U.S., especially in areas with frequent drug crimes, 65 outposts have been set up. The agency has also deployed a team of undercover agents and bought informants from criminal gangs. Its Washington headquarters has collected 15,000 samples of counterfeit currency, which can be quickly identified using electronic scanning microscopes. Since the printing of U.S. currency has not changed since 1963, the U.S. Treasury has proposed an update plan to add a clear polyester strip. This way, counterfeit bills copied on a copier will leave easily recognizable black marks. However, how to implement this plan is still under consideration.

    假美元何其多
    本报记者　仓立德
    “当你拿到一张10元以上大面值美钞时，小心上当，它可能是假的！”——最近一份美国杂志提出上述警告，并告诉人们如何判定钞票的真伪。
    这不是危言耸听。去年7月，纽约布朗克斯区有位清洁工在清理垃圾袋时，竟倒出成捆“刚出厂”新票，共达1800万美元。当局确认是假钞后，顺藤摸瓜，在全美各地拘捕了85名案犯及其头目弗朗西斯科·斯科科察。这是美国有史以来破获的最大伪钞制造集团。然而，这个集团两年来已伪造了1亿美元，相当部分早已流行市面。专司缉查、鉴别假钞案的美国联邦经济情报局，在1988财政年度共收缴1.22亿美元伪钞，本年度为8800万美元，但这只是冰山的一角。该局估计，美国国内每年伪造的假钞高达10亿美元，境外还有另外10亿美元。
    照理说，伪造美钞难乎其难。所有美钞统统由设在华盛顿的联邦造币局监制，要经过65道互相独立的复杂程序。全部印版均由手工精雕而成，每个刻版人只能负责其中一小部分。内含75％棉质和25％亚麻，嵌有蓝、红相间人造纤维细线的造币用纸，一律出自马萨诸塞州克雷恩公司一家。由凹版和活版反复组合完成，油墨的配方高度保密。但事实是，假钞制造者往往略施小伎，便可偷天换日。
    从已知的案例看，有的罪犯投资不足1万美元，便可开办“家庭印钞厂”，手段是照相、制铝版、平版胶印。有些印刷厂老板或雇员索性利用现成设备，在工余或假日偷印。还有的人干脆将1美元钞票上的面值漂白，然后换上20、50或100的字样。因为各种面值的美元纸币除头像不同外，尺寸和颜色相同。
    在诸多伪造美元的犯罪活动中，有几种倾向颇令美国当局头痛。一是规模越来越大。早几年集团偷印二三百万美元已属罕见，现在动辄三四千万甚至上亿；参与犯罪的人更多，范围更广。
    其二，作案手段多样化。如今年7月在南卡罗来纳州抓获的约翰·麦考利，用售价仅为5万美元的佳能牌彩色激光复印机，先后伪造价值80万美元的美国、加拿大钞票。随着各种彩色复印技术不断提高，复印机价格相对下降，预计此类问题会更加层出不穷。
    其三，犯罪活动已将触角伸至现钞以外的其他一切流通手段领域。如当局去年10月仅在佛罗里达州便查获价值3900余万美元的伪造旅行支票。此外，购物信用卡、银行本票，甚至商店发行的优惠折扣券，都成为伪造对象。
    再者，美元假钞的国际化倾向愈益严重。1988年世界各国查获的美元假钞达1.25亿美元；而美国国内查获的伪钞中，有34％来自海外，其中相当部分来自拉美。在欧洲，意大利、西德均抓获盗印上千万美元的犯罪团伙，其伪钞质量之高，甚至前往协助破案的美国联邦调查局特工也难以辨别真伪。苏联内务部称，1986—1988年共破获326起卢布、美元假钞案。至于亚洲，也流通着大量100美元面值的伪钞。菲律宾今年3月在马尼拉郊区摧毁了一个专印美元和日元的黑窝。一些中东国家也发现了美元假钞。
    据联邦经济情报局人员分析，伪造美元的动机，除美元在国际流通领域吃得开、较易脱手外，毒品犯罪猖獗是主要原因。美国是毒品的最大市场，大多现金交易，利润极高。铤而走险的贩毒商或者私设印钞厂伪造美元，或者用低于面值20％—30％的价格买进假钞，然后用这些“美元”来进行毒品交易。
    面对假钞泛滥成灾，美国当局除抓紧缉查、严加防范外，迄今别无良策。目前拥有近2000名雇员的联邦经济情报局已在世界各主要都市设立了办事处；在国内各地，尤其是毒品犯罪频繁地区，部署了65个网点，该局还布置了一批便衣密探，收买了一些犯罪同伙的内线告密者。其华盛顿总部已收集了15000种假钞样品，可通过电子扫瞄显微镜迅速鉴别新发现伪钞的种类及质地。因美元纸币的印制自1963年以来毫无变化，美国财政部已提出一项更新方案，准备在纸币中加入一道清晰的聚酯线。这样，在用复印机复制时，伪钞便会留下极易辨认的黑色印记。但如何实施这项方案，仍在酝酿之中。
