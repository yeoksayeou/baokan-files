The founding conferences of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League and the Northern Branch of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League were both held in 1930. At that time, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party was in an underground state and faced persecution. For progressive left-wing organizations to hold a meeting, it was not as easy as today to arrange a grand auditorium and convene a meeting leisurely. Usually, they would borrow a venue from sympathetic supporters, hastily and efficiently hold a high-quality meeting.

A conference like the Left-Wing Writers' League, which coordinated the literary disputes since the May Fourth Movement and united progressive writers from various factions, was undoubtedly solemn and grand. However, we completed the task of the founding conference in a simple and tense yet passionate atmosphere, paving the way for the proletarian literary movement in the future.

The founding conference of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League was held in Shanghai, using a large classroom at the Shanghai Chinese Art University. That school has long since closed, but the old site still exists. Now, the Shanghai Hongkou District Committee and the District Government, the Shanghai Lu Xun Memorial Hall, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences Institute of Literature, and the *Sprouts* magazine office have jointly formed the preparatory committee for the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League Memorial Hall. Through their efforts, it will be officially inaugurated on March 2, 1990, the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Left-Wing Writers' League.

The site of the founding conference of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League has been restored, but what about the site of the founding conference of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League? Although the site of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League is still well-preserved, it has become part of Xinhua News Agency and cannot be an independent memorial hall.

This building was completed in 1915 and was the "National Assembly Hall" of the Beiyang Government. In 1924, Cao Kun bought votes to be elected, and the "pig delegates" made a fool of themselves, so what assembly was there to speak of? Subsequently, Cao Kun stepped down, and Duan Qirui became the acting president, exercising the powers of the president. Then, the Northern Expedition Army captured Beijing, and the executive government was also gone. Without a president, there was no new assembly, and this place was left vacant. Just in time, the Beijing Law and Politics University was cramped, so it moved into the National Assembly Hall, which was located in the House of Representatives, and the Senate to the west of the road.

Why could the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League hold its founding conference in the Law School auditorium? During the underground period, small meetings were usually held in private residences, school classrooms, or parks. Large-scale meetings had a large target and were not easy to find a big place to hold. After the failure of the Revolution in 1930, many young students were ideologically confused and increasingly leaning to the left, seeking progress. Therefore, in various universities and colleges, there were generally secret party organizations. As for the clear-headed students, under the influence of the Communist Party, they flocked to revolutionary organizations to find a way out. In addition, the warlords Chiang, Yan, and Feng were fighting, and the spies and agents were busy with political struggles, leaving a gap for semi-public revolutionary activities. I remember that on September 18, 1930, around 10 a.m., posters were put up in various universities and colleges, saying that "Mr. Yin Fu" would give a lecture in the grand auditorium of the Law School, and the poster was issued by the "Literary Research Society." The meeting time was at 2 p.m. I remember that afternoon, around 1 p.m., the Law School campus was bustling with young students coming and going. Soon, they gathered in front of the grand auditorium, then crowded into the auditorium. The seats were full, and the aisles and the back of the auditorium were packed with people. Even the indoor corridors, entrances, and windows were filled with people! Imagine, the name Yin Fu was actually the name of the left-wing writer Xu Yinfu (also known as Bai Mang), and the topic was literature, how could it not attract left-leaning young people who loved literature to rush to listen to the lecture? In fact, that day, the meeting was not convened by the "Literary Research Society," but by the preparatory committee of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League; the lecturer was not Xu Yinfu, but Zhang Zhang, one of the preparatory members of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League. We did this to deceive the enemy and avoid sabotage. Even the time of posting the posters was arranged with great skill: too early and the secret might leak; too late and the crowd might not make it in time. Ten o'clock was not far from lunchtime, and after lunch, it was just right to rush to listen to the lecture. Even the suburban areas of Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and the Agricultural College could make it. In addition, our party members temporarily did mobilization work, so that day, the number of people attending the meeting was so enthusiastic, and the meeting was so smooth and safe.

I remember that day the meeting was very concise and tense. Zhang Zhang spoke for about ten minutes on literary issues, and then Segan Xuexin announced the beginning of the founding conference of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League. After Xuexin reported on the significance and combat tasks of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League, Wang Wen Zheng of the Municipal Committee spoke about the domestic and international political situation and the tasks of writers. Then, Pan Xun (also known as Pan Moxia) announced the election of the executive committee. After the election, the meeting was adjourned, lasting about an hour and a half. Due to the short duration, and the strict guard of the security personnel from the alleys to the gates and various entrances to the auditorium, the reactionary military police did not discover that we were holding the founding conference of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League.

Nearly sixty years have passed, and under the leadership of the successive executive committees, the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League has cultivated many writers, intermittently published more than ten magazines, and participated in the political struggles and social activities led by the party. Especially in the Southward Demonstration Movement, the members of the Left-Wing Writers' League were always at the forefront, until the December 9th Movement and the "Minxian" Movement, the members of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League never fell behind. Now the members have dispersed, and there are not many comrades left to see. However, the faces of a few comrades who fought bravely, especially those who were slaughtered by the enemy or died of overwork, are still vivid in my mind!

I will never forget the venue of the meeting. I often went to the Law School auditorium to participate in activities. Progressive scholars such as Chen Baoyin, Liu Kangyuan, and Hou Wailu gave lectures in that auditorium, and I went to listen; I also went to the Law School to hold secret meetings and took the opportunity to visit the auditorium. It was a building with bricks laid in a staggered pattern, facing south. From the front, it looked: a solemn main entrance, with side entrances on both sides; looking up, you could see a row of neat windows on the second floor, very imposing and solemn.

Now this building is well-preserved by Xinhua News Agency and has been renovated and refurbished. The interior facilities are basically the same as before. There are about six or seven hundred seats on the sloping floor, and the tables and chairs are firmly nailed to the floor. The seats fan out towards the back in five rows, and there are also seats on the three sides of the second floor.

The triangular roof of the National Assembly Hall in the Xinhua News Agency still has the characters "Assembly Hall" written in traditional Chinese characters on the right side. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics has embedded the words "National Assembly Hall" on the left side of the wall in front of the door, indicating that it is a key cultural relic protection unit. As for the historical significance of holding such an important founding conference of the Northern Branch of the Left-Wing Writers' League, especially under the White Terror, breaking through numerous difficulties to successfully hold such a conference, it is self-evident. It is just that commemorating this venue is difficult to be independent like the Shanghai Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League. I think if a commemorative plaque could also be embedded on the wall, or a monument could be erected at the entrance, it would be satisfying.

    北方左联会址
    杨纤如
    中国左翼作家联盟成立大会和北方左翼作家联盟成立大会都是在1930年召开的。那时是在国民党统治之下，共产党处于被迫害的地下状态，进步的左翼团体要开个会，难以像今天这样，安排一个堂皇的礼堂，从从容容地开会。一般是借用同情支持者一个场所，匆匆忙忙开个干脆利落、高质量的会。
    像左联这样协调“五四”以来文坛纷争、团结各派进步作家的大会，其隆重庄严可知；但我们却在简单而紧张热烈的空气中，完成成立大会的任务，为以后无产阶级文学运动开辟了道路。
    中国左翼作家联盟成立大会，是在上海，借用上海中华艺术大学一间大教室举行的。那个学校早已停办了，但学校的旧址还在。现在由上海虹口区委及区政府、上海鲁迅纪念馆、上海社科院文研所以及《萌芽》杂志社四单位，联合组成中国左翼作家联盟会址纪念馆筹备处，经过努力工作，即将在明年3月2日中国左联成立六十周年之日正式揭幕。
    中国左翼作家联盟成立大会的会址修复了，那么，北方左联成立大会的会址情况如何呢？北方左联的会址虽说依然保存完好，但已成为新华社所属的一部分，不可能作为独立的纪念馆了。
    这座建筑物，落成于1915年，它是北洋政府时代的“民国国会会堂”。1924年曹锟收买议员贿选，猪仔议员们出尽了丑，还有什么议会可言？接着曹锟下台，段祺瑞当了临时执政，代行大总统职权。接下来北伐军克复北京，连执政府也完了蛋。没了大总统，也就没有新的国会，这地方就空下来了。正好北京法政大学校舍窄狭，就迁进民国国会会堂所在的众议院及路西的参议院。
    为什么北方左联可以在法学院礼堂开成立大会呢？原来地下时期，小会大都在私人住室、学校教室或公园里举行。大型会议目标太大，找个大地方举行是很不容易的。1930年在大革命失败以后，青年学生中不少的人，思想苦闷，日趋左倾，要求进步。因此各大中学校里，一般都有党的秘密组织。至于头脑清醒的学生，在共产党影响下，纷纷向革命组织找出路。加以蒋阎冯军阀混战，侦探间谍忙于敌对的政争，给革命活动留下一段可以半公开活动的空隙。记得1930年9月18日，各大中学校园里，约在上午十点钟左右，纷纷贴出海报，说是“殷夫先生”在法学一院大礼堂讲演，出海报的具名是：“文艺研究会”。开会的时间是下午二时。我记得那天下午一点多钟，法学一院校园里来往青年学生川流不息，一会儿，徘徊在大礼堂门前空场上，一会儿挤进大礼堂。座位坐满了，五行通道及礼堂后都站满了人，连室内走廊入场门和窗外都站满了人！试想殷夫其名，正是左翼作家徐殷夫（即白莽）之名，讲的又是文艺问题，能不令爱好文艺的左倾青年争先恐后去听讲演吗？其实呢，那天召集会的并不是什么“文艺研究会”，而是北方左翼作家联盟筹备处；讲演人并非徐殷夫，而是北方左联筹备人之一的张璋同志。我们这样做，为的是迷惑敌人，免遭破坏。连贴海报的时间，都作了很技巧的安排：早了怕走漏机密；迟了怕群众赶不及。十点钟离吃午饭不远，吃完饭赶去听讲演正好。连郊区的清华、燕大、农学院也赶得及。加以我们党团员临时做了动员工作，所以那天到会的人是那么踊跃，会开得那么顺利安全。
    我记得那天会开得很紧凑，也很紧张。张璋同志讲了十几分钟的文艺问题，之后，就由段雪笙同志宣布北方左翼作家联盟成立大会开始。雪笙报告北方左联成立意义及战斗任务之后，即由市委王文正讲了讲国内外政治形势及作家任务。接着由潘训（即潘漠华）同志宣布选举执委会。选举毕即宣告散会，前后一共用去一个多小时。由于时间不拖延，加以保卫人员从胡同进路到大门和各道门直到礼堂的严密把守，反动派军警一直未发现我们是召开北方左联成立大会。
    近六十年过去了，北方左联在历届执委领导下，培养出不少作家，时断时续地办了十几种刊物，始终不渝地参加了党领导的政治斗争和社会活动。特别是南下示威运动，左联盟员都是急先锋，直到“一二·九”运动、“民先”运动，北方左联盟员从未落后。如今盟员已是风流云散，能见到的同志不多了。不过几位英勇战斗的同志的面孔，特别是牺牲在敌人屠刀下的、积劳病逝的同志的面孔，闭上眼都活灵活现在我脑海里！
    我更忘不了开会的会址。法学一院大礼堂，我曾不断到那里去活动。进步学者如陈豹隐、刘侃元、侯外庐诸先生在那个礼堂讲课，我去听过；到法学一院开秘密会，也顺便去礼堂玩玩。那是一座磨砖对缝、座北向南的建筑物。迎面看来：庄严的正门，左右展开的是侧门；举头可见楼上一排整齐的格窗，十分气派庄严。
    现在这座建筑物，新华社保存完好，并加以修饰装新。室内设备大致如原貌。坡形地板上设座约六七百席，桌椅是牢钉在地板上的，扇形向后展开，中间有五行通道，楼上三面廊子也有座席。
    新华社内民国国会会堂那三角形的楼顶，右书繁体“议场”二字依然存在。北京市文物局在门前左侧墙上嵌有“民国国会会堂”字样，说明是重点文物保护单位。作为北方左联在历史上举行如此重大成立大会，特别是在白色恐怖下，冲破了重重难关，开成了如此一个大会，其意义是不待说的。只是纪念这个会址，难以像上海中国左联那样独立成组。我想如能也在墙上嵌个纪念牌，或者在门口立块碑，也就心满意足了。
