People's Daily, South Yang, December 7th - Reporters Lǐ Jié and Lǐ Ér Liàng report: The South Yang region of Henan Province is vigorously developing a commercial economy with science and technology as its pillar, taking new strides in agricultural modernization.

In the entire South Yang region, which consists of 13 counties and cities, there are 3 national and provincial key poverty-stricken counties, with nearly 500,000 impoverished households. In 1986, the South Yang region shifted its traditional relief-based poverty alleviation approach to a science and technology-based development approach, quickly achieving results. Three key poverty-stricken counties broke out of the subsistence level ahead of schedule. Five mountainous counties saw their total industrial and agricultural output value 7.3 percentage points higher than the regional average, and the per capita income of farmers was 8.3 percentage points higher.

However, in the process of science and technology-based poverty alleviation, issues such as fragmented administration, dispersed economy, and individualistic operations have constrained the transition from subsistence to prosperity in the South Yang region. To address this, the South Yang region has promoted the development of a commercial economy in various forms.

- The region is vigorously developing a multi-form and multi-level technical and economic service system to support the commercial economy. Over 600 various types of mass technical associations and societies in the region are gradually transforming into integrated entities for research, production, operation, and service.

- The region is focusing on base construction. According to resource advantages, industries are selected, bases are built according to industries, series processing is carried out for development, and science and technology are relied upon to increase efficiency. Commercial bases are being constructed. At the same time, contract groups are organized for large-scale development. Based on last year's foundation, this year, 300 million mu of high-yield and high-efficiency farmland development and 100 million mu of medium and low-yield farmland development were organized, adding an economic benefit of 436 million yuan and increasing grain production by 267 million kilograms.

- The region is encouraging farmers to develop family-scale appropriate operations. Currently, there are over 5,000 small-scale farms, fisheries, forests, and tea plantations in the entire region.

    发展商品经济　注重科技作用
    南阳地区脱贫致富迈大步
    本报南阳12月7日电　记者李杰、李而亮报道：河南南阳地区大力发展以科技为支柱的规模商品经济，在科技兴农上迈出新的步伐。
    南阳全地区13个县市中，有3个是国家、省重点贫困县，贫困户近50万户。1986年，南阳地区把传统的救济救急型扶贫转向为科技开发型扶贫，很快收到了效果。3个重点贫困县提前冲出了温饱线。5个山区县工农业总产值比全地区平均高7.3个百分点，农民人均收入高8.3个百分点。
    但在科技扶贫中也遇到了条块分割、经济分散、各自为战等制约因素，直接影响南阳地区从温饱攻坚向脱贫致富的过渡。据此，南阳地区以各种形式推进规模商品经济发展。
    ——大力发展多形式、多层次的技术经济服务体系，作为促进规模商品经济的支撑。全区600多个各类群众性技术协会、学会逐步向科研、生产、经营、服务一体化转变。
    ——搞好基地建设。根据资源优势选产业、按照产业建基地、系列加工搞开发、依靠科技增效的方针建设商品基地。同时组织承包集团，连片开发。在去年基础上，今年组织了300万亩高产高效益农田开发、100万亩中低产田开发等，共增加经济效益4.36亿元，增产粮食2.67亿公斤。
    ——鼓励农民发展家庭适度规模经营。目前，全地区小牧场、小渔场、小林场、小茶场已发展到5000多个。
