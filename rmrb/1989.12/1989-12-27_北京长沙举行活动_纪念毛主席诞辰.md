Comrades who had worked alongside Mao Zedong, such as Yè Zǐlóng and Hóu Bō, along with Mao Zedong's children, encouraged the Young Pioneers to carry on the revolutionary traditions initiated by Chairman Mao, to love the Communist Party, to learn from Lái Níng, and to become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.
