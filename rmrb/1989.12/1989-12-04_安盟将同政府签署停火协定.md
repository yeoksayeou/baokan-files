UNITA to Sign Ceasefire Agreement with Government

Xinhua News Agency, Kinshasa, December 2nd - The leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi, said tonight here that UNITA is ready to sign a ceasefire agreement with the Angolan government at any time.

Savimbi made these remarks after concluding two meetings with the mediator of the Angolan conflict, Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko.

Savimbi believes that the Angolan government has recently adopted a constructive attitude towards the ongoing peace talks, abandoning the demand to force him into exile, and agreeing to the principle of developing the national political system towards a two-party coalition government. He also said that UNITA will also put forward positive proposals to facilitate the progress of the peace talks.

Savimbi did not reveal the details of the ceasefire proposals discussed with Mobutu. He only said that signing a ceasefire agreement is important to him.

    安盟将同政府签署停火协定
    新华社金沙萨12月2日电  争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟领导人萨文比今晚在这里说，安盟随时准备同安哥拉政府立即签署停火协定。
    萨文比是在同安哥拉冲突调解人、扎伊尔总统蒙博托两次会谈结束后向报界说这番话的。
    萨文比认为，对目前正在进行的和平谈判，安哥拉政府最近采取了建设性的态度，放弃了迫使他流亡的要求，并同意了国家政治制度向两党联合组阁方向发展的原则。他还说，安盟也将提出积极的建议，以便使和平谈判能取得进展。
    萨文比没有透露他同蒙博托讨论的停火建议的详细内容。他只是说，能签署停火协定对他来说是重要的。
