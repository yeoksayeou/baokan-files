Those who have visited Japan will notice that whether in supermarkets or small vegetable shops, the vegetables sold are often very vibrant, giving an impression of freshness. This is not only due to good preservation work but also largely because they have been artificially colored and modified. The Japanese call these artificially colored vegetables "makeup vegetables."

According to inspections by the Tokyo Market Hygiene Inspection Office in fourteen markets, approximately 17% of the vegetables have been chemically treated and colored. For example, lotus roots are bleached with ascorbic acid to appear white, sweet potatoes are dyed with sulfuric acid to appear purple-red, and ginger is colored with aniline dyes to appear creamy yellow. The most commonly used chemical is phosphoric acid; many vegetables are soaked in phosphoric acid to appear more vibrant.

Currently, the impact of "makeup vegetables" on human health has sparked considerable discussion among the Japanese. After relevant inspections, it was found that although the chemical content in the vegetables sold in the market is still within safe limits, long-term use can be harmful to the body. For instance, phosphoric acid can make bones brittle if it accumulates in the body. Additionally, vegetables that have been chemically colored and soaked lose their nutritional value and taste.

The appearance and spread of "makeup vegetables" are understandable. Since vegetables that do not sell on the same day have to be significantly discounted the next day, vegetable vendors use these deceptive, even criminal, methods to attract customers and increase sales. The Japanese government has taken notice of this issue and has started dispatching market hygiene inspectors to the largest vegetable market in Tokyo, the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market, and other locations for routine inspections. However, most Japanese consumers believe that these measures are far from sufficient to eradicate "makeup vegetables."

### “化妆蔬菜”在日本

    “化妆蔬菜”在日本
    郑安生
    到过日本的人会发现，无论是超级市场还是小菜店，所出售的蔬菜大都非常鲜艳，给人以水灵新鲜的印象。这除保鲜工作做得好以外，很大程度上是经过了人工着色和修饰。日本人将那些人工着色的蔬菜称之为“化妆蔬菜”。
    据东京市场卫生检查所对十四个菜市场检查，大约有百分之十七的蔬菜经过化学药剂浸泡和着色。例如，藕用抗坏血酸漂白后显得白净，地瓜用亚硫酸着色后显得紫红，生姜用黄胺类药物着色后呈乳黄色。使用最多的化学物质是磷酸，许多蔬菜用磷酸浸泡后色泽比原来鲜艳得多。
    目前，“化妆蔬菜”对人体的影响已经在日本人中引起了不少的议论。有关方面进行检测后认为，虽然现在市场上出售的蔬菜所含化学药剂尚在安全界限以下，但如果长期使用，对人体会构成危害。例如磷酸，在人体内达到一定程度会使骨质变得疏松。另外，经过化学着色和浸泡的蔬菜，其营养价值和味道都会受到损害。
      “化妆蔬菜”的出现和蔓延，其原因是显而易见的。因为蔬菜一旦当天卖不出去，第二天就要大幅度地削价。蔬菜商为了招徕顾客，增加销售，便采用这种欺骗甚至犯罪的办法。日本政府对此已引起重视，并开始派市场卫生检查人员，到东京最大的蔬果市场——东京都大田市场等地进行巡回检查。但多数日本消费者认为，这一措施还远远不能根除“化妆蔬菜”。
