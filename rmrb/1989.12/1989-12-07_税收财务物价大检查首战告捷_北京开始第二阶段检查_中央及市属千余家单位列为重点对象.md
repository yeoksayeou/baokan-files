	Tax, Financial, and Price Inspection Achieves Initial Success;
	Beijing Enters Second Phase of Inspection
	Over a Thousand Central and Municipal Units Listed as Key Targets

	BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has launched a comprehensive inspection of tax, financial, and price issues, entering the key inspection phase starting Dec. 4. A total of 350 central units and 900 municipal units in Beijing have been listed as key targets for inspection.

	It is reported that the first phase of the tax, financial, and price inspection in Beijing began on Sept. 23 and ended at the end of November. During this period, some units took the initiative to link this work with strengthening their own clean governance and law-abiding efforts, daring to self-inspect, expose, and correct issues. Meanwhile, the municipal financial, tax, audit, and price departments worked together to conduct in-depth inspections. Relevant municipal departments also organized people's congress representatives, political consultative conference members, and members of democratic parties to inspect the implementation of price policies in industries such as coal, timber, chemicals, and grains, supervising and urging corrections as they inspected.

	Due to the attention and effective measures from all levels of leadership, this work has progressed smoothly. By the end of November, through self-inspection, a total of 163.47 million yuan in tax evasion, unpaid taxes, and misappropriated funds were uncovered, with 115.67 million yuan to be remitted to the state treasury. The self-inspection results were significantly better than in previous years.

	To ensure the success of the second phase of the tax, financial, and price inspection of key units this year, municipal leaders have demanded strict inspections, with legal consequences for violations, particularly focusing on uncovering units' private "small treasuries." All funds that should be remitted to the state treasury must be fully remitted, with no exceptions or special cases allowed.

    税收财务物价大检查首战告捷
    北京开始第二阶段检查
    中央及市属千余家单位列为重点对象
    本报北京12月6日讯　记者赵兴林报道：北京开展税收、财务、物价大检查，自12月4日起进入重点检查阶段，中央在京企事业单位350户和市属单位900户已被列入重点检查对象。
    据介绍，北京市第一阶段开展的税收、财务、物价大检查，9月23日开始至11月底结束。在此期间，一些单位积极行动，把开展这项工作同加强自身廉政建设、遵纪守法等有机地联系在一起，勇于自查，敢于揭露、亮丑，自觉纠正。同时，市财政、税务、审计、物价等部门通力合作，深入检查。市有关部门还组织人大代表、政协委员和民主党派人士，深入煤炭、木材、化工、粮油等行业，逐一检查其执行物价政策情况，边检查，边督促其改正。
    由于各级领导重视，措施得力，这项工作发展顺利。到11月底，通过自查共查出偷漏税款、漏交税款、截留挪用等违纪金额1.6347亿元，应上缴入库1.1567亿元。自查成果明显好于往年。
    为了搞好本年度第二阶段的税收、财务、物价重点单位的检查工作，市领导要求检查从严，违法必究，特别注重清查单位私设的“小金库”。凡应上缴国家财政的要全部入库，决不让步，更不搞下不为例。
