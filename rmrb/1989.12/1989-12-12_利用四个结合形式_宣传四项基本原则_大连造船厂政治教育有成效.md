The largest shipbuilding base in China—Dalian Shipyard—has, over the past few years, persistently used the "four integration" methods to promote education on the Four Cardinal Principles. This has invigorated the spirits of all the factory's cadres and workers, and continuously pushed the enterprise's production to new heights.

Integrating with workers' daily ideological activities. In response to some workers' doubts, the factory party committee has listed specific topics to conduct unit-based education on issues such as the inevitability of socialism overcoming capitalism, the necessity of adhering to the Party's leadership to achieve the Four Modernizations, and the importance of the Four Cardinal Principles to China's construction and development.

Integrating with various activities in the enterprise. The factory party committee has successively launched discussions on enterprise spirit and the behavior of masters in the new era. Among nearly 4,000 party members, a campaign to strive for excellence has been initiated. The factory's Communist Youth League committee has organized young workers to discuss the standards for the 1980s Communist Youth League members, and the factory's science and technology association has conducted activities on "discussing ideals and comparing contributions" among technical personnel.

Integrating with education on the situation and national conditions. The factory party committee has used various forms to explain the national and factory situations to the workers, emphasizing the status of industrial workers and enhancing their professional pride.

Integrating with education on reform and opening up. The significant changes brought about by Dalian Shipyard's 10 years of reform and opening up have made the workers realize that to revitalize the country, one must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and carry out reform and opening up.

    利用四个结合形式  宣传四项基本原则
    大连造船厂政治教育有成效
    据新华社沈阳12月9日电　（记者夏阳、李小林）我国最大的船舶工业基地——大连造船厂，几年来坚持利用“四个结合”的形式进行四项基本原则教育，使全厂干部职工精神振奋，企业生产不断跨上新台阶。
    和职工日常的思想活动相结合。针对一部分职工思想上的疑点，厂党委列出专题，就社会主义必然要战胜资本主义、只有坚持党的领导才能实现四化、中国的建设和发展离不开四项基本原则等问题进行单元式教育。
    与企业开展的各项活动相结合。厂党委先后开展了企业精神大讨论和新时期主人翁行为的大讨论，在近4000名党员中开展争先创优活动，厂团委组织团员青工开展“80年代共青团员标准讨论”，厂科协在技术人员中开展了“讲理想，比贡献”活动。
    和形势教育、国情教育相结合。厂党委利用各种形式向职工宣讲国情和厂情，讲产业工人的地位，增强了工人的职业自豪感。
    与改革开放教育相结合。大连造船厂改革开放10年的巨大变化，使工人们认识到，要使国家振兴，就得坚持四项基本原则，就得搞改革开放。
