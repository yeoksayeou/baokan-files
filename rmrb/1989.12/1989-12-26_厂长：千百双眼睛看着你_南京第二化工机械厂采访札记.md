Recently, during an interview, the reporter saw that some enterprise leaders, facing difficulties such as lack of funds, sluggish sales, and product backlog, were worried. When enterprise leaders sigh, the workers also lose confidence, and the atmosphere in the factory becomes dull.

In Nanjing Second Chemical Machinery Factory, the reporter saw a different scene. The entire factory is full of confidence. Some are busy with the final stages of new product trials, some are rushing to produce matching equipment and parts for users, and some are repairing machines to prepare for next year's production. How did this lively scene come about? Is it because this factory has no difficulties? No. They also face considerable difficulties.

Nanjing Second Chemical Machinery Factory is a key enterprise in the national chemical machinery industry and a national second-level enterprise. In the past three years, production has been increasing, and the main economic and technical indicators have been leading in the industry nationwide. In the first three quarters of this year, the output value and tax revenue increased by 28% and 50% respectively compared to the same period last year. However, since September, due to some construction projects being halted, some users unable to pay for deliveries, the factory's warehouse has accumulated products worth 10 million yuan, causing difficulties in fund turnover. Additionally, next year's orders are severely insufficient, making the entire factory's cadres and workers anxious, with thousands of eyes watching the factory director.

Factory Director Zōng Zhìpéng's attitude is: in the face of difficulties, the factory director must not lose heart or slack off. He told the workers, "We have difficulties, but we also have solutions. Agriculture needs to develop, and fertilizer production needs to increase. As long as we get our production and operations right, we won't be short of work."

The factory sent people to eight provinces and regions to visit many new and old users, discovering that although some new factories have been halted, the technical renovation of small fertilizer plants is still underway, requiring a large number of high-efficiency, low-energy-consuming equipment. Some factories urgently need individual equipment and parts for renovation and maintenance, and are worried about not being able to buy them. The leadership communicated these findings to the masses, asking everyone to brainstorm and find solutions. After heated discussions and collective wisdom, the factory made three decisions: first, to set aside the big factory's pretensions, changing from selling only complete sets of fertilizer equipment to supplying both complete sets and individual parts. Any single equipment and parts needed for fertilizer plant technical renovations will be guaranteed. Second, to complete the trial production of urea synthesis towers and 1.2-meter ammonia synthesis towers by the end of the year to meet the demand for improving product grades and quantities in existing small fertilizer plants. Third, to strengthen management, reduce consumption, and implement thin-profit, high-volume sales. These measures quickly showed results, with many users coming to the door to request the supply of equipment and parts, and the factory's workers becoming more and more enthusiastic.

The approach of Nanjing Chemical Machinery Factory No. 2 may provide some enlightenment for some enterprises that are still struggling with difficulties. It shows that in the current efforts to overcome difficulties and improve adaptability, the spiritual state of enterprise leaders is crucial. If the leader is not in high spirits, does not actively find solutions, but passively waits, even opportunities may be lost. On the contrary, if the leader is not afraid of difficulties, leads the masses to investigate and study, broaden their horizons, find ways, and seek development opportunities from the contradictions between product backlog and shortage, they can get out of the predicament and make the enterprise's production stable and develop on a stable path.

    厂长：千百双眼睛看着你
    ——南京第二化工机械厂采访札记
    本报记者　李茜
    最近记者在采访中，看到有些企业领导人面对资金短缺、销售不旺、产品积压等困难，忧心忡忡。企业领导唉声叹气，职工也就信心不足，企业里气氛沉闷。
    在南京第二化工机械厂，记者见到的是另一番景象。这个厂上上下下信心十足，有的忙新产品的试制收尾，有的为用户赶制配套的设备和部件，有的检修机器，为明年生产作准备。这种生机勃勃的情景是怎么来的呢？是这个厂没有困难吗？不是。他们遇到的困难也相当大。
    南京第二化工机械厂是全国化工机械行业的骨干企业，也是国家二级企业，前3年生产节节上升，主要经济技术指标在全国同行业中居领先地位，今年前3个季度实现产值、利税又分别比去年同期增长28％和50％。但是进入9月份以来，由于一些基建项目下马，部分用户无钱提货，仓库中积压了价值1000万元的产品，造成工厂资金周转困难，加上明年订货严重不足，全厂干部和职工心急如焚，几千双眼睛盯着厂长。
    厂长宗志鹏的态度是：在困难面前，厂长首先不能泄气、松劲。他对职工说，我们面前有困难，但也有办法，农业要发展、化肥要增产，只要我们生产经营的路子走对了，就不愁没活干。
    工厂派人奔赴八个省、区，走访许多新老用户，发现有些地方新建厂虽然下马了，小化肥厂的技术改造还在紧张地进行，需要大量效率高、能耗低的设备；有些厂在改造、维修中急需单个设备和部件，还发愁买不到。领导把这些调查到的情况告诉群众，让大家出主意，想办法。经过热烈讨论，集思广益，厂里作出了三项决策：一，放下大厂架子，把只卖成套化肥设备改为既供应成套设备，又可拆整为零，出售单个零部件，凡化肥厂技术改造需要更新的单件设备和零部件，一律保证供应。二，年底前完成尿素合成塔和1.2米氨合成塔的试制工作，以满足现有小化肥厂提高产品档次和产量的需求。三，加强管理，降低消耗，实行薄利多销。这几条措施公布后，很快收到了成效，不少用户登门要求供应设备和零部件，本厂职工的干劲也越来越足。
    南京化工机械二厂的做法，对有些至今还在困难中徘徊的企业，或许会有一点启示。它说明在当前战胜困难，提高应变能力方面，企业领导的精神状态至关重要。如果领导精神不振，不是积极想办法，而是被动等待，可能得到的机会也会丧失。反之，领导不畏艰难，带领群众调查研究，开阔视野，找窍门，从产品积压与短缺的矛盾中寻求发展机遇，就能走出困境，使企业生产走上稳定发展的道路。
