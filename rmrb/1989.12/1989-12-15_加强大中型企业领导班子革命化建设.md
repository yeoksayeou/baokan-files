The decision passed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "On Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform," emphasizes the importance of further playing the leading role of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. This is of great significance. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the mainstay of China's socialist modernization construction. They are not only economic organizations and the main bearers of socialist commodity production but also important strongholds of socialism. Years of practice have proven that to build and fully play the role of large and medium-sized enterprises, the key lies in having a leadership team that can resolutely implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and lead the masses forward, and a group of good leaders.

A good leadership team should meet the "four modernizations" standards, achieving youthfulness, knowledge, and professionalism under the premise of revolutionization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out as early as 1980: "Under the premise of adhering to the socialist road, we must make our cadre team youthful, knowledgeable, and professional, and gradually formulate and improve the cadre system to guarantee it. The three conditions of youthfulness, knowledge, and professionalism are, of course, first and foremost revolutionary, so it is said that we must adhere to the socialist road as a premise." Revolutionization and youthfulness, knowledge, and professionalism are complementary. Without adhering to revolutionization and only emphasizing technology and business, it is difficult to adhere to the socialist road and the Party's leadership; without emphasizing knowledge and professionalism, it is impossible to build socialist modernization. In the contemporary world, scientific and technological development is changing rapidly, and management knowledge is constantly updating. The leadership team must adapt to this new situation. Only by adhering to the premise of revolutionization, mastering the scientific and technological and business skills of building socialism, understanding the laws of economic development, and adhering to reform and opening up, can we better play the advantages of socialist enterprises, more fully embody the spirit of the working class as masters of the country, and thus create a higher level of production technology and labor productivity than capitalist enterprises.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, cadres have been selected according to the "four modernizations" standards, and various levels of Party organizations have done a lot of work. Therefore, the situation of cadres has changed greatly. Practice has proven that this policy is completely correct. However, it must also be seen that in recent years, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's weakening of the Party's leadership and the reduction of ideological and political work, some enterprises have stopped emphasizing the revolutionization of the leadership team. After experiencing this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, we have become more soberly aware of the extreme importance of adhering to the "four modernizations" standards for cadres, and more soberly aware of the need to place revolutionization first. This is a major issue in ensuring that our revolutionary cause is passed on from generation to generation and is the fundamental guarantee of adhering to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics.

To strengthen the revolutionary construction of leadership teams in state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, several issues need special attention.

First, political quality must be improved. The key is to consistently adhere to the four cardinal principles. As a leader, the fundamental belief must not be shaken, especially in critical moments, one must be able to withstand the test. This requires a firm stance, a clear understanding that the socialist system has strong vitality, and that it is superior to the capitalist system. Communism will ultimately replace capitalism. For more than a hundred years, imperialism invaded China, bringing in capitalism, which resulted in China becoming a colony and semi-colony in a miserable state. This history fully proves that capitalism does not work in China. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and by taking the socialist road can we find the only way out. A few people advocating bourgeois liberalization, advocating political pluralism, ideological liberalization, and economic privatization, in essence, want to Westernize everything. Their ideas can only cause great turmoil in China, making China once again a vassal of Western capitalist countries. Socialism fundamentally guarantees the position of workers, peasants, and intellectuals as masters of the country and the broadest democratic rights for the people, opening up the broadest space for the people to give full play to their initiative and creativity. This is incomparable to capitalism.

This incident from the turmoil to the counter-revolutionary rebellion has been a sharp test of the political quality of our leaders at all levels. Why, when a few people with ulterior motives planned and manipulated students to take to the streets to create turmoil, did some of our comrades not smell it out, and even sympathize and support it? Fundamentally, it is because the belief in Marxism-Leninism is not firm, and the awareness of class struggle has weakened. This is a profound lesson.

How to improve the political quality of leaders? The most fundamental thing is to strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially to study philosophy. As a member of the Communist Party, especially a leading cadre, one must have a sense of urgency in learning, taking time to systematically study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Using the perspective of dialectical and historical materialism, closely linking international, domestic, and work realities, adopting historical and scientific comparative methods, conducting new and old society comparisons, national situation comparisons, and comparing the achievements of socialist construction in the 40 years since the founding of New China with the several hundred years of capitalist development history, we can recognize the superiority of socialism over capitalism in the long river of historical development, and firmly believe that only socialism can save China and only socialism can develop China. Through learning, we must establish a scientific worldview and a firm proletarian stance. Only in this way can we correctly observe problems and analyze the situation, and in the complex political struggle, grasp the direction, and firmly implement the policy of reform and opening up, and adhere to the development path of socialist enterprises with Chinese characteristics.

Second, good moral character must be cultivated. The most important thing is to establish a selfless and dedicated spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. As members of the enterprise leadership team, how do we view the value of life? It is to be bold in pioneering, proactive in progress, constantly discovering and innovating, striving to develop the enterprise, and making the greatest contribution to the country, the people, and socialist construction, and with the development of production, continuously improving the living standards of the workers.

In terms of moral character, leaders should avoid several things: First, do not place personal interests above the interests of the Party, the state, and the people, and do not be concerned with personal gains and losses, reputation, and status. Second, do not be arrogant and self-satisfied, thinking highly of oneself, and being unable to accept criticism and different opinions when there are some achievements in work. Third, do not argue over who is bigger or smaller, higher or lower in the leadership team. Principles should be argued over, and personal fame and fortune should be yielded. Fourth, do not be autocratic and undemocratic, letting one person decide everything. Fifth, do not practice special privileges. Leading cadres must be clean and upright, not practice special privileges, and always remember that they are members of the Communist Party. They must live within the organization, within the system, and among the people. They must insist on participating in organizational life meetings, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and accepting the supervision of Party members and the masses. Especially for newly promoted young leading cadres, they must strictly demand of themselves, never show off, and must work hard to do practical things, establish authority in practice, and gain the trust of the masses.

Currently, how to handle the relationship between the Party and the government in enterprises is a focal point of general concern. In recent years, due to the weakening of the Party's leadership and the reduction of ideological and political work, the authority of the Party has been reduced in some enterprises, the team has become scattered, and thoughts have become chaotic. Therefore, after the turmoil and rebellion were suppressed, the Central Committee emphasized that the Party committee in enterprises should play a political core role. This has led to the issue of whether the factory director is the center and the Party committee is the core. How should we deal with this new situation? The key is to rely on the strong Party nature of Party member cadres and the desire for unity, and handle the relationship between the two under the principle of democratic centralism. The factory director's responsibility system must be adhered to, and the overall responsibility for enterprise production and operation must be borne by the factory director. This is the objective requirement of modern large-scale production, and the Party's political leadership must also be strengthened. This is necessary for enterprises to adhere to the socialist direction and ensure the completion of all tasks. As long as one is a member of the Communist Party, whether a factory director or a secretary, one must speak of Party nature and the overall situation. In this way, one can work together in unity and put the Party's cause first, without arguing over who is bigger or smaller. If, due to the implementation of the factory director's responsibility system, the Party committee relaxes political leadership and ideological and political work, this is an irresponsible and weak Party nature. Conversely, due to the strengthening of the Party committee's political core role, the factory director feels that his power is reduced and he cannot take responsibility, this is also a manifestation of weak Party nature. Those who understand the factory director's responsibility system as one person deciding everything, or understand the strengthening of the Party's political leadership as returning to the past when the Party committee took everything, are both wrong. In this regard, the experience of Daqing Oilfield is: after implementing the factory director's responsibility system, one should achieve "two respects" and "three unities," that is, the factory director respects the secretary's "captain" position in the collective leadership of the Party committee, and the secretary respects the factory director's full responsibility in production and management; the secretary and the factory director are united, the Party and the government are united, and the leadership and the masses are united. This experience is very valuable.

Third, correct leadership methods must be mastered. Leading cadres must adhere to the mass line. Whether a leader is skilled or not depends on what they focus on. A skilled leader first focuses on people's work and improving people's quality, and focuses on building the team. An enterprise has various types of work that need to be done, but a few leading cadres cannot do it all. The responsibility of a leader lies in educating the masses, organizing the masses, and mobilizing the masses. The working class is the main body of the enterprise, and enterprise leaders must establish the idea of relying on the working class wholeheartedly, giving full play to the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the broad masses of workers, making them feel that they are the masters of the country and the enterprise, and consciously doing a good job in production and management. This force is invincible.

Fourth, we must inherit and carry forward the Party's "three great styles" and continue the Party's fine traditions. For the countless contradictions and problems in enterprise production activities, we must use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze and observe, with the core being to adhere to seeking truth from facts, pay attention to investigation and research, analyze specific problems specifically, and be good at grasping the main contradictions. Make subjective understanding as consistent as possible with objective reality, and avoid subjectivism and metaphysics.

We must put down our airs, open our legs, and go among the people to understand what the people are doing and thinking, help them solve difficulties and problems, and become one with the people. We must not have a floating style, relying on issuing orders all day in the office.

Style must be cultivated in daily life and tempered in practice, and the key is for cadres to take the lead. Good style is brought about by leading cadres setting an example, not by orders. Strict requirements must start with leading cadres themselves. What is required of the masses must be done by oneself first, and what is not allowed for the masses must not be done by oneself first. If one is strict with others but lenient with oneself, saying one thing and doing another, it is impossible to be strict, and the authority of the leadership will be lost. Strict requirements must start with a large number of, common, small, and specific problems, and must be strict in opposing low standards, old habits, bad habits, and various unhealthy tendencies.

Fifth, one must have strategic vision and long-term planning. In the reform, especially in the implementation of the contract responsibility system and the factory director's term target responsibility system, one must be careful to avoid short-term behavior. One must not only consider personal and small group interests in the short term, but also harm national interests and long-term interests. In work, one must not only grasp current production but also have a long-term goal, doing one step, looking at two steps, and thinking about three steps. In the application and development of science and technology, one must not only grasp applied research but also carry out forward-looking research and experiments, producing one generation, developing the next generation, and researching the third generation. Only in this way can the enterprise be full of vitality and adapt to changes, always standing unshakable.

Sixth, one must have the spirit of hard work and innovation. In the new situation, hard work should be reflected in: being hard-working in thought. Industry is mainly a struggle with nature, and one must adhere to the dialectical materialist method of thinking, through "practice, cognition, practice, cognition," repeatedly, continuously summarizing, deepening understanding, and gradually mastering the objective laws of things, and taking the initiative in transforming the objective world. If one encounters complex situations and retreats in the face of difficulties, one will achieve nothing. Only by persevering can one achieve new results. In work, one must be diligent and hardworking, doing things seriously and diligently, with high standards and strict requirements. One must work hard on being serious and diligent, and avoid being careless, sloppy, and superficial, not seeking thorough understanding, and having a beginning but no end. In terms of career, one must have great ambition and be able to lead workers to fight hard battles. One must dare to climb the peak of science and technology, dare to compete with the world's advanced level, and dare to create a first-class level. Being listless and retreating in the face of difficulties is not the style of a Communist Party member. Leading cadres must take the lead in living a few tight years. In production and construction, one must be meticulous in planning, repair old things for new use, reduce costs, tap potential, and oppose extravagance and waste. One must resolutely correct the unhealthy trends of violating financial discipline and state regulations, arbitrarily starting projects, arbitrarily increasing costs, and issuing bonuses.

The material and cultural life of workers should be improved, but it can only be improved correspondingly with the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity. Exceeding this limit, the enterprise cannot sustain development, and the country will suffer losses. At all times, one must think of the 1.1 billion people in China, and the country is still not rich, and everything must be done in accordance with this national condition. In recent years, under the impact of the high-consumption trend, some construction in enterprises has exceeded the limits of production development. In the situation where production funds are very tight, living and welfare facilities should not pursue luxury and extravagance.

To select and cultivate cadres who meet the "four modernizations" standards, the principle of the Party managing cadres must be implemented. The selection of cadres at the middle and above levels in large and medium-sized enterprises must be discussed collectively by the Party committee, and it is absolutely not allowed for one person to decide everything. Otherwise, it will weaken the Party nature and organizational consciousness of Party member cadres, and even lead to abnormal phenomena of personal dependence. This is very dangerous. It must be seen that after being examined by the organization and discussed collectively by the Party committee, it is more comprehensive to look at problems than one person, and many problems can be prevented in the use of people. With the Party's leadership and supervision, it is possible to select people according to the requirements of both virtue and ability. Attention must be paid to selecting cadres from outstanding workers and technical personnel who have been tempered at the grassroots level. For newly graduated university students, they must be organized to be tempered on the front line of production and scientific research to improve their practical work ability and cultivate feelings for the working class, and gradually select the outstanding ones to leading positions.

    加强大中型企业领导班子革命化建设
    康世恩
    党的十三届五中全会通过的《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》，强调进一步发挥国营大中型企业的骨干作用，有着十分重要的意义。国营大中型企业是我国社会主义现代化建设的主要支柱。它既是一个经济组织，是社会主义商品生产的主要承担者，又是社会主义的重要阵地。多年来的实践证明，要把大中型企业建设好，充分发挥它们的作用，关键在于有一个能坚决贯彻落实党的路线、方针、政策，带领群众前进的领导班子，有一批好的带头人。
    一个好的领导班子，应该符合干部“四化”标准，在革命化的前提下，实现年轻化、知识化、专业化。小平同志早在1980年就明确指出：“要在坚持社会主义道路的前提下，使我们的干部队伍年轻化、知识化、专业化，并且要逐步制定完善的干部制度来加以保证。提出年轻化、知识化、专业化这三个条件，当然首先是要革命化，所以说要以坚持社会主义道路为前提”。革命化与年轻化、知识化、专业化是相辅相成的。不坚持革命化，只讲技术业务，就难以坚持社会主义道路和党的领导；不重视知识化、专业化，也不可能搞好社会主义现代化建设。当代世界是科学技术发展日新月异、管理知识不断更新的年代，领导班子必须适应这个新的形势。只有既坚持革命化的前提，又掌握建设社会主义的科学技术和业务本领，懂得经济发展规律，坚持改革开放，才能更好地发挥社会主义企业的优势，更充分地体现工人阶级当家作主的主人翁精神，从而创造出比资本主义企业更高的生产技术水平和劳动生产率。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，按照干部“四化”标准选拔干部，各级党组织做了大量工作，因而干部状况有了很大变化。实践证明，这个方针是完全正确的。但是也要看到，近几年来，由于赵紫阳同志淡化党的领导，削弱思想政治工作，在某些企业里对领导班子革命化的要求不提了。经历过这次动乱和反革命暴乱之后，我们更加清醒地看到坚持干部“四化”标准的极端重要性，更加清醒地看到必须把革命化放在首位。这是保证我们革命事业代代相传的重大问题，是坚持走有中国特色的社会主义道路的根本保证。
    如何加强国营大中型企业领导班子的革命化建设，有几个问题需要特别重视。
    第一，要提高政治素质。关键是要始终不渝地坚持四项基本原则。作为领导干部，根本信仰决不能动摇，尤其是在紧要关头要经得起考验。这就要有坚定的立场，明确认识社会主义制度有着强大的生命力，肯定比资本主义制度优越，共产主义最终必然要代替资本主义。一百多年来帝国主义侵略中国，也曾带来了资本主义，其结果使中国沦为殖民地、半殖民地的悲惨境地。这个历史充分证明，资本主义在中国是行不通的。只有在中国共产党的领导下，走社会主义道路才是唯一出路。搞资产阶级自由化的极少数人，鼓吹什么政治上的多元化，思想上的自由化，经济上的私有化，其实质就是要搞全盘西化。他们的这一套，只能在中国造成四分五裂的大动乱，把中国重新沦为西方资本主义国家的附庸。社会主义从根本上保证了工人、农民和知识分子的主人翁地位和最广泛的民主权利，为人民群众发挥积极性、创造性开辟了最广阔的天地。这是资本主义所不可比拟的。
    这次从动乱到反革命暴乱的事件，对我们各级领导干部的政治素质，是一个尖锐的考验。为什么在少数别有用心的人策划、操纵学生上街游行，制造动乱的时候，我们有些同志却嗅不出来，甚至同情支持？从根本上说，就是马列主义信仰不坚定，阶级斗争观念淡薄了，这是一个深刻的教训。
    如何提高领导干部的政治素质？最根本的是要努力学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，特别要学习哲学。作为一个共产党员，尤其是党员领导干部，要有学习的紧迫感，抽出时间系统地学习马列主义的基本理论，学习毛泽东同志和邓小平同志的著作。运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点，紧密联系国际、国内和工作中的实际，采取历史的、科学的对比方法，进行新旧社会对比，国情对比，新中国成立四十年社会主义建设成果和资本主义几百年发展历史的对比，从而认识在历史发展的长河中，社会主义对资本主义的无比优越性，深信只有社会主义才能救中国，只有社会主义才能发展中国。要通过学习，树立科学的世界观，坚定无产阶级立场。这样才能正确地观察问题、分析形势，才能在错综复杂的政治斗争中把握方向，坚定不移地贯彻改革开放的方针，坚持走有中国特色的社会主义企业的发展道路。
    第二，要培养好的思想品德。最重要的是确立大公无私的胸怀和全心全意为人民服务的思想。作为企业领导班子的成员，怎么看待人生价值？就是要勇于开拓，积极进取，不断有所发现，有所发明，努力使企业得到发展，为国家、为人民、为社会主义建设做出最大的贡献，而且随着生产的发展，使职工生活不断改善。
    在思想品德上，领导干部有几条应该切忌：一是切忌把个人利益置于党的利益、国家利益和群众利益之上，计较个人利害得失、名誉地位。二是切忌骄傲自满，自以为是，工作中有点成绩，就沾沾自喜，听不得批评，听不得不同意见。三是切忌在领导班子中，争你大我小，你高我低。原则问题上该争要争，个人名利上该让要让。四是切忌独断专行，不讲民主，一个人说了算。五是切忌搞特殊化。领导干部要廉洁奉公，不搞特殊化，还要时刻牢记自己是个共产党员，一定要生活在组织之中，制度之中，群众之中。坚持参加组织生活会，开展批评和自我批评，接受党员和群众的监督。特别是新提起来的年轻领导干部更要严格要求自己，决不能摆排场，端架子，而要下功夫干实事，在实践中建立威信，取得群众的信任。
    当前，如何处理好企业里党政关系问题，是人们普遍关心的一个焦点。这几年，由于淡化党的领导，削弱思想政治工作，使一些企业中党的威信降低，队伍涣散，思想混乱。因此，中央在平息动乱和暴乱后，强调企业党委在企业中要发挥政治核心作用。这样，就出现了厂长是中心，党委是核心的问题。怎么对待当前出现的这种新情况？关键是要靠党员领导干部坚强的党性，团结的愿望，在民主集中制原则下处理好两者关系。厂长负责制必须坚持，企业生产经营由厂长全面负责，这是现代化大生产的客观要求，党的政治领导也必须加强，这是企业坚持社会主义方向，保证各项任务全面完成的需要。只要是共产党员，无论厂长、书记，都要讲党性，讲大局，这样就能团结共事，就能把党的事业放在第一位，而不会在个人谁大谁小上兜圈子。如果因为实行厂长负责制，党委就放松政治领导，放松思想政治工作，这是不负责任、党性不强的表现。反之，由于加强党委政治核心作用，厂长就认为自己权小了，没法负责了，同样是缺乏党性的表现。那种把厂长负责制理解为一个人说了算，或者把加强党的政治领导理解为又恢复过去党委包揽一切，都是错误的。在这方面，大庆油田的经验是：在实行厂长负责制后，要做到“两个尊重”、“三个同心”，即厂长尊重书记在党委集体领导中的“班长”地位，书记尊重厂长在生产经营管理中全权负责；书记与厂长同心、党政同心、领导与群众同心。这个经验是很可贵的。
    第三，要掌握正确的领导方法。领导干部必须坚持群众路线。领导高明不高明，就看出手抓什么？一个高明的领导，首先要着眼于做人的工作，提高人的素质，在建设队伍上下功夫。一个企业有各种各样的工作需要抓，只靠几个领导干部是做不好的。作为领导的责任就在于教育群众、组织群众、发动群众。工人阶级是企业的主体，企业领导一定要树立全心全意依靠工人阶级的思想，充分发挥广大职工的主动性、积极性和创造性，使他们切身感到自己是国家的主人，企业的主人，自觉地搞好生产，管好企业。这个力量是不可战胜的。
    第四，要继承和发扬党的“三大作风”，把党的优良传统坚持下去。对企业生产活动中成千上万的矛盾和问题，要用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去分析、去观察，核心是坚持实事求是，重视调查研究，具体问题具体分析，善于抓主要矛盾。使主观认识尽可能符合客观实际，避免主观主义和形而上学。
    要放下架子，迈开双脚，到群众中去，了解群众在干什么，想什么，帮助他们解决困难和问题，和群众打成一片，成为他们的贴心人。决不能作风飘浮，靠成天坐办公室发号施令。
    作风要靠平日养成，靠实践中磨练，关键是干部带头。好作风是领导干部以身作则带出来的，不是命令出来的。严格要求，必须从领导干部自己严起。要群众做到的自己先做到，要群众不做的自己先不做。如果对人严，对己宽，说一套，做一套，就不可能严起来，领导威信也会丧失殆尽。从严要求，必须从大量的、常见的、细小的、具体的问题抓起，要狠反低标准、老毛病、坏习惯和各种不正之风。
  第五，要有战略头脑，长远打算。在改革中，特别是在实行承包制和厂长任期目标责任制的情况下，要注意克服短期行为。绝不能只顾个人和小集体的眼前利益，而损害国家利益和长远利益。在工作上既要抓好当前生产，又要有一个长远的奋斗目标，做到走一步，看两步，想三步。在科学技术的应用和发展上，既要抓好应用科研，还要搞好超前研究试验，生产一代，开发下一代，研究第三代。这样才能使企业充满生机和活力，适应情况的变化，始终立于不败之地。
    第六，要有艰苦创业精神。在新形势下，艰苦奋斗应体现在：思想上要艰苦。搞工业主要是和自然界作斗争，必须坚持辩证唯物主义的思想方法，经过“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”，这样反复多次，不断总结，加深认识，才可能逐步掌握事物的客观规律，在改造客观世界中居于主动地位。如果遇到复杂情况，就畏难退缩，那就必然无所作为，只有锲而不舍，才能不断取得新的成果。工作上要刻苦。就是要踏踏实实，勤奋努力，有头有尾，高标准，严要求。要在认真刻苦上下功夫，切忌轻浮潦草，马虎凑合，不求甚解，有头无尾。事业上要有雄心壮志，能带领职工打硬仗。敢于攀登科学技术高峰，敢于同世界先进水平较量，敢于创一流水平。萎靡不振，遇难则退，不是共产党员的风格。领导干部要带头过几年紧日子。在生产建设中精打细算，修旧利废，降低成本，挖掘潜力。反对大手大脚，铺张浪费，坚决纠正违反财经纪律和国家规定，乱上项目，乱挤成本，滥发奖金等不良风气。
    职工物质文化生活应当改善，但只能是随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，相应地提高职工待遇。超越这个界限，企业就不能持续发展，国家也会蒙受损失。什么时候都要想到我国有11亿人口，国家还不富裕，办什么事情都要符合这个国情。这几年在高消费思潮的冲击下，企业中有些建设超过了生产发展的界限。在生产资金十分紧张的情况下，生活福利设施不能追求豪华，奢侈浪费。
    选拔、培养符合“四化”标准的领导干部，必须贯彻党管干部的原则。大中型企业中层以上领导干部的选拔，一定要坚持党委集体讨论，决不能搞一个人说了算。否则就会削弱党员干部的党性和组织观念，甚至会出现人身依附的不正常现象。那是十分危险的。必须看到，经过组织考核，党委集体讨论，总比一个人看问题更全面，在用人上可以防止许多弊端。有了党的领导和监督，就可以按照德才兼备的要求把好用人关。要注意从优秀工人和经过基层锻炼的技术人员中选拔干部。对新毕业的大学生，要组织他们到生产科研第一线锻炼，以提高实际工作能力，培养工人阶级感情，对其中优秀的要逐级选拔到领导岗位上来。
