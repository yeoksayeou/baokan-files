(1) Those who engage in prostitution or sell sex;
(2) Those who force, introduce, instigate, or lure others into prostitution or selling sex;
(3) Those who intentionally harbor others engaging in prostitution or selling sex;
(4) Those who intentionally provide convenient conditions for prostitution or selling sex;
(5) Those who extort money or goods from prostitutes or those selling sex while allowing their activities to continue.

Article 2: Those who shield or obstruct the investigation of prostitution activities, and whose actions are serious, shall be given a punishment of revocation of Party posts or higher.

Article 3: Hotels, inns, restaurants, and guesthouses, due to poor management, where prostitution activities frequently occur, the directly responsible leaders shall be given a Party disciplinary warning or revocation of Party posts.

Article 4: Those who do not investigate or take measures to prevent the recurrence of prostitution activities by employees of their unit, the directly responsible leaders shall be given a Party disciplinary warning or serious warning.
