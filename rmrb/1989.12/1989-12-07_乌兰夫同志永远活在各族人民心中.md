In December 1988, I went to Guangdong to inspect work. Before leaving, I visited Wulanfu in the hospital. He had just undergone surgery but was in good spirits and was preparing to be discharged soon. I advised him to focus on his treatment and only return to work after fully recovering. He also advised me to take care of my health. Unfortunately, while in Guangdong, I received the news of Wulanfu's sudden passing, which left me in deep shock and sorrow. I immediately sent a telegram to express my condolences to this veteran communist warrior and outstanding leader of ethnic work, and also mourned the loss of a close comrade.

My interactions with Wulanfu began before the Anti-Japanese War. In August 1941, the organization decided he should go to Yan'an to work, first at the Institute of Nationalities, then at the Border Region National Affairs Commission, mainly focusing on ethnic work. I had more contact with him, and our friendship deepened. After the founding of New China, we worked together in the Central People's Government and the State Council. After the Cultural Revolution, I was transferred back to the central government from Guangdong, and we jointly managed the united front work and ethnic work. In the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, we served together. Over the decades of working together, regardless of the circumstances, we could openly exchange views on major issues concerning the country and ethnic groups, and on implementing the Party's lines, principles, and policies. We helped each other and cooperated closely. He was a kind, humble, and cautious person with an open heart and a sincere attitude. He valued revolutionary friendships, considered the overall situation, upheld Party principles, and never calculated personal gains or losses. Whatever work the Party assigned, he did it wholeheartedly. He was a respected mentor and friend.

Wulanfu was one of the outstanding leaders of the Party and the state in ethnic work. He consistently adhered to the combination of Marxist theory and practice, creatively carried out ethnic work, and made significant achievements in both practice and theory.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Party Central Committee proposed, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to launch an autonomous movement in Inner Mongolia. Using the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation as a form, it united various strata and mobilized the masses. When conditions were ripe, it established a national autonomous government. Wulanfu, following the Party Central Committee's instructions, went to Inner Mongolia from Yan'an to oversee the matter. On November 25, 1945, Wulanfu, according to the Party Central Committee's instructions, convened a conference of representatives from various leagues and banners in Zhangjiakou, establishing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation. This became a revolutionary mass organization led by the Communist Party of China, uniting various ethnic groups and strata in Inner Mongolia, with certain governmental functions. At that time, led by the former head of the puppet Mongolian Government, Buyingdaerai, a so-called "Temporary Government of the Republic of Inner Mongolia" was established in Xisu Niute Banner. Wulanfu, disregarding personal safety, went to Xisu Niute Banner with a few cadres to understand the situation, propagate the Party's policies and principles for solving the Inner Mongolia issue, expose the separatist intentions of a few individuals, and win over the majority, absorbing progressive elements into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation, causing the "Temporary Government" to dissolve. Premier Zhou Enlai praised Wulanfu's trip as "single-handedly attending the meeting."

Soon after, Wulanfu, following the Central Committee's instructions, solved the problem of the "Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party" and the "East Mongol Autonomous Government" in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. As early as the Great Revolution period, with the support of our Party, the "Inner Mongolia National Revolutionary Party" was established, which was changed to the "Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party" in 1927 and later dissolved by the Comintern. After Japan's surrender, some who had participated in the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia reestablished the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party. Participants included many Mongolian youth seeking national liberation and social progress, as well as high-ranking officials from the puppet Manchukuo Xingan Province. In early 1946, the "East Mongol Autonomous Government" was established under the leadership of this party, basically controlling the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. Although it played a positive role in stabilizing the local situation and proposed opposing the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism, it advocated "high autonomy" and "independent autonomy." To implement our Party's principles for solving the Inner Mongolia issue and win over this force, the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China, led by Li Fuchun, sent people to do a lot of work and established an office of the Eighth Route Army in Wangfugou (Ulanhot). However, it did not change the idea of a few people advocating "independent autonomy." To solve the eastern problem, Wulanfu first sent a working team from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation to the east. Later, he personally went to Chengde to oversee the negotiations between representatives of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation and the "East Mongol Autonomous Government," known as the famous "April 3rd Conference." This conference mainly addressed who would lead the Inner Mongolia revolution and what kind of autonomy to implement. Wulanfu analyzed the domestic and international situation and the environment in which Inner Mongolia was located, expounded on the interdependent relationship between various ethnic groups and the history of the Inner Mongolia revolutionary struggle, and explained that the Inner Mongolia revolution was part of the Chinese revolution. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the development of the national revolution, could victory be achieved. He also pointed out that, under the existing conditions, work must first be carried out in the form of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation. When the time was ripe, an autonomous government would be established. Under Wulanfu's leadership, through the painstaking and patient work of our Party comrades, they accepted our Party's principles for solving the Inner Mongolia issue. The representatives of both sides reached a consensus. The leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation added representatives from the eastern region, and the Eastern Branch was established. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation, led by our Party, unified the leadership of the Inner Mongolia autonomous movement and revolutionary struggle, dissolved the "East Mongol Autonomous Government," and announced the dissolution of the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party. Wulanfu firmly implemented the Central Committee's instructions, successfully solved this problem, widely united the Mongolian people of all strata, and realized the unity of long-divided Inner Mongolia, laying the foundation for the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Wulanfu's outstanding achievements were highly praised by the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai. Some representatives and many progressive youth from the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party and the East Mongol Autonomous Government joined the Communist Party. They played an important role in the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the victory of the Inner Mongolia democratic revolution, and the subsequent socialist revolution and construction.

On May 1, 1947, at the Inner Mongolia People's Representatives Conference held in Ulanhot, the "Administrative Program of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government" and the "Temporary Organizational Outline of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government" were adopted, and the Temporary Council and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government were elected, with Wulanfu elected as the chairman of the autonomous government. The "May 1st Conference" announced the birth of the first national autonomous region in our country, creating an example for the subsequent correct solution of the national issue by the People's Republic of China.

From 1947 to 1966, the democratic revolution, socialist transformation, and construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were all carried out under the leadership of the autonomous region Party committee led by Wulanfu, in accordance with the principles and policies of the Party Central Committee. Premier Zhou Enlai praised the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a model autonomous region for the whole country, providing rich experience for national work and the implementation of national regional autonomy in the country.

Wulanfu consistently adhered to the unity of the motherland, equality among ethnic groups, unity among ethnic groups, national regional autonomy, and mutual assistance and common prosperity among all ethnic groups. He was good at combining the principles and policies of the Party Central Committee with the specific characteristics of national regions and implementing a cautious and steady policy in all work. In the democratic reform of the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Wulanfu proposed a series of policies suitable for the characteristics of ethnic minority regions, such as "no struggle, no division, no class distinction" and "mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdsmen owners," which united the ethnic minority people of all strata and ensured the smooth progress of the democratic reform. In the socialist transformation, he proposed a policy of redemption for herdsmen owners similar to that for the national bourgeoisie. He also proposed: to vigorously cultivate and use ethnic minority cadres and also pay attention to cultivating and using Han cadres; to strive to develop the economy and culture of ethnic minority regions; to organize medical teams to eliminate infectious diseases left over from the old society and ensure the health of the Inner Mongolia people; to effectively develop animal husbandry and agricultural economy, prohibit the reclamation of pastures, and protect animal husbandry; to establish an industrial system in Inner Mongolia with the Baotou industrial base as the mainstay. The implementation of these series of policies strengthened the unity between Mongolians, Hans, and various ethnic groups, and made Inner Mongolia, which was once poor and backward, begin to prosper and gradually realize the de facto equality among ethnic groups.

During the ten years of turmoil, the Party's ethnic work was seriously damaged, and the Party's ethnic policies were brutally trampled. To restore and implement the Party's ethnic policies, soon after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Wulanfu presided over the National Border Work Conference and delivered an important speech at the conference. This conference was, in fact, a national ethnic work conference, an important conference for comprehensively and systematically rectifying the chaos in ethnic work. The conference reaffirmed the Party's various ethnic policies, especially the policy of national regional autonomy, and emphasized the combination of state support and self-reliance to accelerate the development of economic and cultural undertakings in ethnic minority regions, continuously strengthen ethnic unity, and safeguard national unity. This conference played an important guiding role in the new era of ethnic work.

Wulanfu particularly valued the rule of law in national regional autonomy. He believed that without the guarantee of a sound and complete socialist legal system, the policy of national regional autonomy could not be implemented. Therefore, he proposed to the Party Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to formulate the "Law of the People's Republic of China on National Regional Autonomy." From 1981 to 1984, Wulanfu, in accordance with the decision of the Central Committee, presided over the drafting group of the Law on National Regional Autonomy and carried out intensive work. The draft of the Law on National Regional Autonomy was revised 17 times, and each draft was carefully reviewed by Wulanfu, sentence by sentence, and discussed with relevant parties many times. After nearly four years of hard work, the "Law of the People's Republic of China on National Regional Autonomy," which condensed Wulanfu's efforts, was finally passed and implemented by the Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress.

In his later years, Wulanfu still cared about the national work of the whole country, especially the implementation of the "Law on National Regional Autonomy." For several consecutive years, he spoke on this issue at the National People's Congress. In August of the previous year, Wulanfu and I led the Central Delegation to participate in the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He repeatedly emphasized the implementation of the "Law on National Regional Autonomy" and ensuring that national autonomous regions fully enjoy the autonomy rights granted by law. Wulanfu devoted his life to the national work of our country. His outstanding contributions will be forever remembered in history.

After the "Gang of Four" was smashed, the Party Central Committee appointed Wulanfu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, to concurrently serve as the head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China. During the ten years of turmoil, the Party's united front policy was severely damaged, and the leading cadres of the united front system and long-term cooperative friends outside the Party were mostly framed and persecuted. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and related people's organizations were forced to stop activities. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the work of the united front, like the work of all fronts in the country, was in a state of neglect and urgently needed to rectify the chaos.

After Wulanfu took over as the head of the Central United Front Work Department, following the instructions of the Central Committee, he did a lot of painstaking and detailed work to restore and develop the united front.

To adapt to the requirements of the new historical period, the Central United Front Work Department convened the National United Front Work Conference, which had been suspended for 16 years, in August 1979. Wulanfu, based on the opinions discussed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's speech at the Political Bureau meeting, made a summary at the conference, comprehensively analyzing the fundamental changes in the class situation in our country and the nature, tasks, principles, and basic policies of the united front in the new period. He clearly pointed out that the capitalist class in our country no longer exists; the united front in the new period has developed into a broad alliance of all socialist laborers and patriots under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, shouldering the dual tasks of serving the Four Modernizations and unifying the motherland; the basic policy of the united front in the new period should abandon the "leftist" practice of taking class struggle as the key link, take the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the main theme, and strictly follow socialist democracy and socialist legal system to correctly handle the internal relations of the united front, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life outside the Party, and strive for the unification of the motherland and the Four Modernizations. Deng Xiaoping's speech and the documents formulated by the National United Front Conference have important guiding significance for correcting the long-standing "leftist" thinking, rectifying the chaos, carrying forward the past, and comprehensively restoring and developing the united front.

Wulanfu attached great importance to the work of democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, personally presiding over the drafting of reports, and proposing to the Party Central Committee to restore the activities of various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. After the Central Committee's approval, he invited the responsible persons of various democratic parties to hold a symposium, fully affirming the historical merits and active role of various democratic parties, and hoping that they would quickly resume work. In 1979, various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held their national congresses, which had been suspended for more than ten years, determined their principles and tasks, and shifted their work focus to the track of serving socialist modernization construction. Various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce actively carried out work and played an important role in the political, economic, cultural, and educational work of the state.

Wulanfu, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee, actively participated in the preparatory work of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, restored and rebuilt the CPPCC organization, united various democratic parties and people from all walks of life, carried out political consultation and democratic supervision, and contributed to the socialist motherland.

In the second half of 1978, the Central United Front Work Department sent a special team to various places to conduct investigations and put forward opinions on the implementation of the policy towards the national bourgeoisie. Later, Wulanfu personally went to Shanghai to investigate and exchanged views with the responsible comrades of the municipal committee before writing a report to the Party Central Committee on the implementation of some policies towards the national bourgeoisie. The Central Committee approved the report of the Central United Front Work Department and instructed all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to implement it. The original industrial and commercial personnel heard the news and spread it, enthusiastically supporting it, and praising the Communist Party of China for implementing the policy of redemption towards the national bourgeoisie, which greatly mobilized their enthusiasm to serve the cause of socialist modernization.

Wulanfu attached great importance to the work of rectifying the wrongly labeled rightists. According to the Central Committee's documents on thoroughly rectifying the wrongly labeled rightists, a joint office was established in the Central United Front Work Department, composed of relevant departments, to handle this matter, and the problem was relatively satisfactorily solved.

In August 1979, under the presidency of Wulanfu, the Central United Front Work Department reported to the Party Central Committee, and after the Central Committee's approval, formally announced the rehabilitation of Comrade Li Weihan and others, removing the hat of "implementing the line of capitulationism" from the departments of united front, ethnic, and religious work, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres in these departments, and playing an important role in restoring and developing the united front and ethnic and religious work.

In the long-term cooperation and interaction with Wulanfu, I deeply understood his consistent adherence to the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Whether in favorable circumstances or in adversity, Wulanfu never abandoned the stance of implementing the Party's lines, principles, and policies based on reality.

In 1958, the "Great Leap Forward" and the "People's Commune" movement caused the spread of wind of exaggeration, the "communist wind," and other "leftist" errors. Later, the erroneous "anti-rightist" struggle was launched, and the democratic life within the Party was seriously damaged. Coupled with natural disasters and other reasons, from 1959 to 1961, our national economy encountered serious difficulties. Due to Wulanfu's insistence on seeking truth from facts, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was less affected by the "leftist" harm and had a relatively better life. However, Wulanfu was criticized by some people for not implementing the Central Committee's line. It was during this period that I, in 1958 and 1961, was sent by Premier Zhou Enlai to Inner Mongolia twice to investigate and understand the situation. At that time, Wulanfu, in the face of difficulties, still insisted on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, leaving a deep impression on me. After the start of the "Great Leap Forward," rural areas across the country were hit by the "communist wind," and public canteens were set up in many places, causing famine in some places. But Wulanfu and the Autonomous Region Party Committee insisted that public canteens could not be set up in pastoral areas, and the mistake of setting up public canteens in rural areas was quickly corrected. At the same time, in the rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, the original private plots and private livestock were retained. During the steel-making campaign, some hastily established steel enterprises suffered heavy losses. Wulanfu said, "Socialism is not called 'loss,' and loss-making enterprises should be shut down," and decided to stop the construction of the new Hohhot Steel Plant. Due to Wulanfu's relatively timely correction of some "leftist" practices, the economy of Inner Mongolia maintained stable development in those years. In 1961, I went to Inner Mongolia and saw a thriving scene, as Guo Moruo said in his poem: "The ethnic flutes are in harmony, and the fields of wheat and millet are bountiful." I returned and reported to Premier Zhou truthfully, and also told Comrade Li Weihan, who was very pleased to hear it.

Later, during the social education movement, due to the influence of the ideology of expanding class struggle, some people came out to negate the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class distinction" in the democratic reform of pastoral areas and proposed to redefine class status in pastoral areas, and vigorously carried out this in some places. Although Wulanfu was under great pressure, he did not follow the trend. He presided over an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, which lasted for a month, and no one agreed to redefine classes. Until 1966 when the Cultural Revolution began, Wulanfu was unjustly criticized, and the Autonomous Region Party Committee did not issue a document on redefining class status in pastoral areas.

Wulanfu's life was a revolutionary life. He devoted his life to the liberation and unification of the motherland, ethnic work and united front work, socialist modernization construction and reform and opening-up, and the equality, unity, and common prosperity of all ethnic groups. His life is closely connected with the history of the revolution and construction of the motherland, especially with the history of the revolution and construction of Inner Mongolia. He was an outstanding leader of ethnic work in our Party, a pioneer and leader of the communist movement of the Inner Mongolia people. Li Weihan once told him, "You must write your memoirs and record your fighting life, otherwise the Party history will lack an important part about ethnic work." At that time, Li Weihan led several assistants to write his memoirs, but unfortunately, he did not complete them before his death. Wulanfu took Li Weihan's words to heart. In his busy official duties, he hurriedly wrote the memoirs of the period before the founding of the country, but he did not have time to complete them before he left us.

The passing of Wulanfu is an irreparable loss to our Party and the country. Although he has left us, his lofty revolutionary spirit and excellent character will forever live in the hearts of all ethnic groups in the country. Not long ago, all ethnic groups in the country celebrated the grand festival of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and are now united around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, striving to implement the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee, which have great historical significance. At this moment, we miss Wulanfu even more and cherish his great achievements in the revolutionary and construction causes of our country, especially in ethnic unity. We should take Wulanfu as an example, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, resolutely implement the basic line of one central task and two fundamental points, further strengthen the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country, work together, strive hard, and make more contributions to consolidating and developing the stable situation of the country, to rectifying the economy, deepening the reform, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

    乌兰夫同志永远活在各族人民心中
    习仲勋
    1988年12月，我去广东考察工作。行前，到医院看望乌兰夫同志。他刚动了手术，但精神很好，准备不久出院。我劝他安心治疗，等健康完全恢复再出院工作。他也要我多保重。不料在广东期间，传来乌兰夫同志溘然谢世的消息，我顿时沉浸在十分震惊和哀思之中，即刻发出唁电悼念这位久经考验的共产主义战士，卓越的民族工作领导人，同时也为失去一位最亲密的老战友而悲痛不已。
    我与乌兰夫同志的交往，在抗日战争以前就开始了。1941年8月，组织决定他到延安工作，先在民族学院，后到边区民委，主要做民族工作。我和他接触就更多了，友谊更深了。新中国建立后，我们先后在中央人民政府和国务院共事。“文化大革命”后，我从广东调回中央，和他共同主管统一战线工作和民族工作。在人大常委会，我们又一起任职。几十年来长期相处，无论在任何时候、任何情况下，我们对国家和民族的重大问题，对贯彻党的路线、方针、政策的问题，都能坦诚交换意见，互相帮助，密切合作。他为人宽厚，谦虚谨慎，襟怀坦白，肝胆照人，十分珍重革命友情。他顾全大局，坚持党性原则，从不计较个人得失，党分配什么工作就做什么工作。他是我深为敬佩的良师益友。
    （一）
    乌兰夫同志是党和国家民族工作的卓越领导人之一。他一贯坚持马克思主义理论和实际相结合，创造性地开展民族工作，在实践和理论上都有许多重要建树。
    抗战胜利后，党中央提出在中国共产党领导下，在内蒙古开展自治运动，以内蒙古自治运动联合会的形式，团结各阶层，广泛发动群众，待条件成熟时建立民族区域自治政权的方针。乌兰夫同志奉命由延安去内蒙古，主持其事。1945年11月25日，乌兰夫同志根据党中央的指示，在张家口召开内蒙古各盟、旗代表大会，成立了内蒙古自治运动联合会，成为中国共产党领导的团结内蒙古各民族各阶层的统一战线性质的、有一定政权职能的革命群众团体。这时，由原伪蒙疆法院院长补英达赖为首，在西苏尼特旗建立了所谓“内蒙古共和国临时政府”。乌兰夫同志不顾个人安危，带几名干部赴西苏尼特旗了解情况，宣传党的政策和解决内蒙古问题的方针，揭露了少数人分裂祖国的企图，争取了多数，把进步分子吸收到内蒙古自治运动联合会中来，使这个“临时政府”解体。周恩来总理称赞乌兰夫同志此行是“单刀赴会”。
    以后不久，乌兰夫同志又遵照中央指示，解决内蒙古东部的“内蒙古人民革命党”和“东蒙自治政府”的问题。早在大革命时期，在我党支持下，就建立了“内蒙古国民革命党”，1927年改为“内蒙古人民革命党”，后被第三国际宣布解散。日本投降后，内蒙古东部少数参加过内蒙古人民革命党的人，又重新建立了内蒙古人民革命党。参加这个党的有不少是追求民族解放和社会进步的蒙古族青年，也有一些伪满兴安总省的高级官员。1946年初又建立了由该党领导的“东蒙自治政府”，基本上控制了内蒙古东部地区，虽然对稳定当地局势起了积极作用，也提出反对国民党大汉族主义，但主张“高度自治”、“独立自治”。为贯彻我党解决内蒙古问题的方针，争取这支力量，中共中央西满分局李富春同志派人做了大量工作，还在王爷庙（乌兰浩特）建立了八路军办事处，但未能改变少数人搞“独立自治”的想法。为解决东部问题，乌兰夫同志先派出了一个内蒙古自治运动联合会东部工作团，随后又亲自赶赴承德主持内蒙古自治运动联合会代表和“东蒙自治政府”代表的谈判，这就是著名的“四·三会议”。这次谈判，主要解决内蒙古革命由谁领导和实行什么样自治的问题。乌兰夫同志分析了国内国际形势和内蒙古所处环境，阐述各民族相互依存的关系和内蒙古革命斗争的历史，说明内蒙古革命是中国革命的一部分，只有在中国共产党领导下，随着全国革命的发展而发展，才能取得胜利。他并指出，在当时条件下，必须先以内蒙古自治运动联合会的组织形式开展工作，待时机成熟，再建立区域性的自治政府。在乌兰夫同志带领下，经过我党同志深入细致的耐心工作，他们接受了我党解决内蒙古问题的方针。双方代表协商一致，内蒙古自治运动联合会领导机关增加东部地区的代表，同时建立东部总分会，由我党领导的内蒙古自治运动联合会统一领导内蒙古的自治运动和革命斗争，撤销“东蒙自治政府”，宣布解散内蒙古人民革命党。乌兰夫同志坚决贯彻中央指示，成功地解决了这一问题，广泛地团结了蒙古族各阶层人民，使长期分裂的内蒙古实现了统一，为建立内蒙古自治区奠定了基础。乌兰夫同志的这一卓越功绩受到党中央、毛主席和周恩来同志的高度评价。内蒙古人民革命党和东蒙自治政府中的一些代表人物和不少进步青年加入了共产党，他们在创建内蒙古自治区，夺取内蒙古民主革命的胜利，及以后的社会主义革命和建设中，都发挥了重要作用。
    1947年5月1日，在乌兰浩特举行的内蒙古人民代表会议，通过了《内蒙古自治政府施政纲领》和《内蒙古自治政府暂行组织大纲》，选出临时参议会与内蒙古自治政府，选举乌兰夫同志为自治政府主席。“五·一”大会宣告了我国第一个民族自治区的诞生，为尔后中华人民共和国正确解决民族问题创造了一个范例。
    从1947年到1966年期间，内蒙古自治区的民主革命、社会主义改造和建设，都是在乌兰夫同志为首的自治区党委领导下，根据党中央的方针政策进行的。周恩来总理赞扬内蒙古自治区为全国的模范自治区，为全国民族工作和实行民族区域自治的地方提供了丰富的经验。
    乌兰夫同志始终如一地坚持祖国统一，民族平等，民族团结，民族区域自治和各民族互相帮助，共同繁荣，共同发展，并善于把党中央的方针政策同民族地区的具体特点结合起来，在各项工作中贯彻慎重、稳进的方针。乌兰夫同志在内蒙古牧区的民主改革中，提出“不斗、不分、不划阶级”，“牧工牧主两利”等一系列适合少数民族地区特点的政策，团结了少数民族各阶层，保证了民主改革的顺利进行。在社会主义改造中，他又提出对牧主实行如同对民族资产阶级一样的赎买政策。他还提出：要大力培养使用少数民族干部，也要注意培养使用汉族干部；努力发展少数民族地区的经济和文化；组织医务力量消灭旧社会遗留下来的传染病，保证内蒙古人民的健康；有效地发展畜牧业和农业经济，禁止开垦牧场，保护畜牧业；建立以包头工业基地为主的内蒙古工业体系。这一系列政策的贯彻执行，加强了蒙、汉和各民族间的团结，使内蒙古由贫困落后开始走上繁荣昌盛、逐步实现民族间事实上平等的道路。
    在十年动乱中，党的民族工作遭到了严重的破坏，党的民族政策受到了粗暴践踏。为了恢复和落实党的民族政策，在党的十一届三中全会开过不久，乌兰夫同志主持召开了全国边防工作会议，并在会上作了重要报告。这次会议，实际上是一次全国民族工作会议，是在民族工作方面全面、系统拨乱反正的重要会议。会议重申了党的各项民族政策特别是民族区域自治政策，强调国家大力帮助和自力更生相结合，加速发展少数民族地区经济文化事业，不断增强民族团结，维护祖国统一。这次会议，对新时期民族工作起了重要指导作用。
    乌兰夫同志特别重视民族区域自治的法制建设。他认为，没有完善而健全的社会主义法制的保障，民族区域自治政策难于落实，必须用法律来确保民族区域自治政策的贯彻执行。为此，他向党中央和全国人大常委会建议制定《中华人民共和国民族区域自治法》。自1981年到1984年，乌兰夫同志根据中央决定，主持民族区域自治法起草小组，进行了紧张的工作。民族区域自治法草案易稿17次，每一稿都经过乌兰夫同志逐条逐句推敲，并与有关方面多次商议。经历将近四个寒暑，凝结乌兰夫同志心血的《中华人民共和国民族区域自治法》终于由六届全国人大二次会议通过实施了。
    乌兰夫同志晚年依然关心全国民族工作，特别关心《民族区域自治法》的贯彻执行，连续几年他都在全国人民代表大会上讲这个问题。前年8月，乌兰夫同志和我率领中央代表团参加内蒙古自治区成立40周年庆祝活动时，他反复强调贯彻执行《民族区域自治法》，保障民族自治地方充分享受法律赋予的自治权利。乌兰夫同志为我国民族工作倾注了毕生精力，他的卓越贡献将永垂青史。
    （二）
    粉碎“四人帮”后，党中央任命中共中央政治局委员乌兰夫同志兼任中共中央统战部部长。十年动乱中，党的统一战线政策受到严重摧残，统战系统领导干部和长期同我党合作的党外朋友大都遭到诬陷和迫害，中国人民政治协商会议、各民主党派和有关人民团体被迫停止活动。党的十一届三中全会后，统一战线工作同全国各条战线的工作一样，百废待举，迫切需要拨乱反正。
    乌兰夫同志担任中央统战部部长后，根据中央的指示，为恢复和发展统一战线做了大量艰苦细致的工作。
    适应新的历史时期发展的要求，中央统战部于1979年8月召开了中断16年之久的全国统战工作会议。乌兰夫同志根据中央政治局讨论的意见和邓小平同志在政治局会议上讲话的精神，在会上作了总结，全面分析了我国阶级状况的根本变化和新时期统一战线的性质、任务、方针和基本政策。他明确指出，我国资本家阶级已经不再存在；新时期的统一战线，已经发展成为在中国共产党领导下的全体社会主义劳动者和一切爱国者的广泛联盟，担负着为四个现代化建设服务和统一祖国的双重任务；新时期统一战线的基本政策应当摒弃阶级斗争为纲的“左”的做法，把正确处理人民内部矛盾作为总题目，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式，严格遵照社会主义民主和社会主义法制，正确处理统一战线的内部关系，充分调动各方面党外人士的积极性，为实现统一祖国和四化建设而奋斗。邓小平同志的讲话和这次全国统战会议制定的文件，对于纠正长期存在的“左”的思想，拨乱反正，继往开来，全面恢复和发展统一战线，有着重要的指导意义。
    乌兰夫同志很重视对民主党派和工商联的工作，亲自主持草拟报告，向党中央建议恢复各民主党派和工商联的活动。中央批准后，他邀请各民主党派负责人举行座谈，充分肯定各民主党派的历史功绩和积极作用，希望他们尽快恢复工作。1979年各民主党派和全国工商联分别召开中断了十多年的全国代表大会，确定方针任务，把工作重点转移到为社会主义现代化建设服务的轨道上来。各民主党派和全国工商联大力开展工作，在国家的政治、经济、文化、教育工作中发挥了重要作用。
    乌兰夫同志根据党中央指示，积极参加第五届全国政协筹备工作，恢复和重建政协组织，团结各民主党派和各界人士，开展政治协商、民主监督，为社会主义祖国贡献力量。
    1978年下半年，中央统战部派专门小组到各地调查研究，提出落实民族资产阶级政策的意见。以后，乌兰夫同志亲自去上海调查，和市委负责同志交换意见后，又向党中央写了关于落实对民族资产阶级若干政策的报告。中央批准了中央统战部的报告，并电示各省、自治区、直辖市切实贯彻落实。原工商业者闻讯奔走相告，热烈拥护，赞扬中国共产党对民族资产阶级的赎买政策说到做到，从而大大调动了他们为社会主义现代化建设服务的积极性。
    乌兰夫同志很重视对错划右派分子的平反改正工作。根据中央彻底改正错划右派分子的文件，在中央统战部设立由有关部门组成的联合办公机构，处理此事，比较圆满地解决了这个问题。
    1979年8月，在乌兰夫同志主持下，中央统战部向党中央报告，经中央批准，正式宣布为李维汉等同志平反，摘掉强加给统战、民族、宗教等工作部门“执行投降主义路线”的帽子，极大地调动了这些部门广大干部的积极性，对恢复和发展统一战线和民族、宗教工作，起了重要的推动作用。
    （三）
    在与乌兰夫同志长期共事和交往中，我对他一贯坚持实事求是的精神是深有体会的。不论在顺利情况下还是处在逆境中，乌兰夫同志从不放弃从实际出发贯彻党的路线、方针、政策的立场。
    1958年“大跃进”和“人民公社化”，使浮夸风、“共产风”等“左”的错误泛滥开来。此后又错误地开展了“反右倾”斗争，党内民主生活受到严重损害。加上自然灾害等原因，从1959年到1961年我国国民经济发生严重困难。由于乌兰夫同志坚持从实际出发，内蒙古自治区受“左”的危害较轻，日子比较好过。但是乌兰夫同志却因此遭受一些人的指责，说他不执行中央的路线。就是在这一时期，我于1958年和1961年两次奉周恩来总理之命到内蒙古调查研究，了解情况。当时，乌兰夫同志在困难的情况下仍坚持实事求是的精神，给我留下了深刻的印象。“大跃进”开始以后，全国各地农村刮“共产风”，大办公共食堂，在不少地方一度造成了饥荒。但乌兰夫同志和自治区党委坚持在牧区不能搞公共食堂，农村也很快纠正停办了。同时，在内蒙古农村、牧区保留了原有的自留地和自留畜。大炼钢铁时，一些轻率上马的钢铁企业亏损比较严重，乌兰夫同志说：“社会主义不姓‘赔’，赔钱的要退下来”，并决定新建的呼和浩特钢铁厂下马。由于乌兰夫同志比较及时地纠正了一些“左”的做法，那几年内蒙古经济保持了稳定发展。1961年，我到内蒙古看到一片欣欣向荣的兴旺景象，正如郭沫若同志在诗中所说：“民族埙篪真协睦，农田禾黍好收成”。我回来向周总理如实作了汇报，并告诉了李维汉同志，他们听了都十分高兴。
    后来在社教运动中，由于阶级斗争扩大化思想的影响，有些人出来否定牧区民主改革时“不斗、不分、不划阶级”的政策，提出在牧区重新划定阶级成份，并在一些地区大张旗鼓地搞了起来。乌兰夫同志虽然受到很大压力，但仍不随风倒。他主持召开了自治区党委常委扩大会议，为期一个月的时间，大家都未同意重划阶级。直到1966年“文革”开始，乌兰夫同志受到不公正的批判，自治区党委也没有发出在牧区重新划分阶级成份的文件。
    乌兰夫同志的一生是革命的一生，他为祖国的解放和统一，为民族工作和统战工作，为社会主义现代化建设和改革开放事业，为各民族的平等、团结和共同繁荣，呕心沥血，奋斗了一生。他的一生与祖国革命和建设的历史联系在一起，特别是与内蒙古革命和建设的历史紧密地联系在一起。他是我们党卓越的民族工作领导人，内蒙古人民共产主义运动的先驱和领袖。李维汉同志生前曾对他说：“你一定要写回忆录，记下战斗的一生，否则党史关于民族工作部分就少了重要的一环。”这时，李维汉同志带领几个助手在写回忆录，可惜没有完成就逝世了。乌兰夫同志把李维汉同志的话记在心里。他在繁忙的公务中，赶写了建国前的部分回忆录，还没有来得及全部完成，也离开我们而去了。
    乌兰夫同志逝世是我们党和国家不可弥补的重大损失。他虽然和我们永别了，但是，他的崇高革命精神和优秀的思想品质永远活在全国各族人民心中。不久以前，全国各族人民欢度了中华人民共和国成立40周年的盛大节日，现在正团结在以江泽民同志为核心的党中央周围，为贯彻执行具有伟大历史意义的党的十三届四中全会、五中全会精神而奋斗。在这样的时刻，我们更加怀念乌兰夫同志，缅怀他对我国革命和建设事业特别是民族团结所建立的丰功伟绩。我们要以乌兰夫同志为榜样，在中国共产党的领导下，坚决贯彻党的一个中心、两个基本点的基本路线，进一步增强全国各族人民的大团结，齐心协力，艰苦奋斗，为巩固和发展全国的稳定局面，为治理整顿、深化改革，建设有中国特色的社会主义做出更多的贡献。
