At a recent plenary session of the Henan Provincial Committee, Yang Xizong, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on all Party members and cadres in the province to learn from and carry forward the spirit of Jia Yu Lu, to wholeheartedly serve the people, to strive hard and make progress.

Yang Xizong pointed out that the mainstream of the Party members and cadres in the province is good and progressive. In the new situation, the Provincial Committee proposes to learn from Jia Yu Lu, which means to learn from his spirit of dedicating himself to the lofty ideal of communism; to learn from his high moral character of wholeheartedly serving the people, devoting himself to the Party's cause and the people's interests, and working tirelessly until his death; to learn from his revolutionary style of hard work, sharing joys and sorrows with the people, and creating wealth through hard work; to learn from his working style of being down-to-earth, connecting with the masses, and working practically; to learn from his high moral character of being strict with himself and serving the public with integrity.

The Henan Provincial Committee decided that after this meeting, starting from the Provincial Committee, all levels of responsible cadres should establish contact points and restore the good practice of on-site guidance. Emphasis should be placed on investigation and research work, establishing a system of investigation and research, and truly going to the grassroots and among the masses to listen to opinions, summarize experiences, and rely on the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses to find ways to overcome difficulties and solve problems. At the same time, during the rectification process, Party discipline and clean governance should be strengthened, and the Party's fine traditions should be restored and carried forward. Party and government leading organs, especially leading cadres, should set an example, bear hardships first, and enjoy the fruits later, and work together with the people of the whole province to live a few years of hardship, unite as one, and help each other.

    学习焦裕禄全心全意为人民服务
    河南省委恢复蹲点指导工作
    据新华社郑州12月26日电（记者景博）中共河南省委书记杨析综在最近召开的河南省委全委扩大会议上，号召全省党员、干部要学习发扬焦裕禄精神，全心全意为人民服务，艰苦创业，奋力进取。
    杨析综指出，当前全省党员干部队伍的主流是好的，是积极向上的。在新形势下，省委提出要大家向焦裕禄学习，就是要学习他那种共产党人献身崇高理想的共产主义时代精神；学习他全心全意为人民服务，为党的事业、人民的利益鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已的高尚品德；学习他艰苦奋斗，与人民同甘共苦、艰苦创业的革命风范；学习他深入实际，联系群众，脚踏实地的工作作风；学习他严于律己，廉洁奉公的高尚情操。
    河南省委决定，这次会议之后，从省委做起，各级负责干部都要确定联系点，恢复蹲点指导工作的好作风。要重视调查研究工作，建立调查研究制度，真正到基层、到群众中去听取意见，总结经验，依靠群众的智慧和干劲，寻求克服困难、解决问题的办法。同时，要在治理整顿过程中，切实加强党风建设和廉政建设，恢复和发扬党的优良传统；党政领导机关特别是领导干部，要作出表率，吃苦在先，享受在后，同全省人民一起过几年紧日子，团结一心，和衷共济。
