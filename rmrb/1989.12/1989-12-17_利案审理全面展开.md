Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 15th.

The Tokyo District Court today began hearing the core issues of the Recruit bribery case, focusing on the bribery and corruption allegations involving Recruit Company's former chairman, Eiji Nakajima, former Cabinet Secretary-General, Takayoshi Fujimori, and parliamentarian Katsuya Ikeda. With this, the Tokyo District Court's trial of Japan's largest post-war bribery case has fully commenced.

The Tokyo District Court has divided the Recruit bribery case into four parts for trial:

1. The political sector, with defendants including Recruit Company's former chairman Eiji Nakajima, former Cabinet Secretary-General Takayoshi Fujimori, former Komeito parliamentarian Katsuya Ikeda, and former Recruit Company Secretary-General Hiroshi Konoye.
2. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) sector, with defendant former NTT chairman Tsuneo Masuda.
3. The Ministry of Education and NTT sector, with defendants former Vice-Minister of Education Kunio Takashi, former NTT president Toshihiko Tanigawa and Seirou Shibamoto, and former First Bank president Hiroshi Kobayashi.
4. The Ministry of Labor sector, with defendants former Vice-Minister of Labor Kazuo Kato, former Recruit Company Director Yasuro Tsunoda, and former Ministry of Labor director Mamoru Kano.

The above 12 defendants have been identified by prosecutors as having committed bribery or corruption. The Tokyo District Court has already begun public trials for the NTT, Ministry of Education and NTT, and Ministry of Labor sectors.

Recruit Company, which started as an advertising agency, is now one of Japan's most influential information and real estate conglomerates. Its founder, Eiji Nakajima, sought to further his business interests during the Nakasone administration by distributing large quantities of unlisted shares of its subsidiary companies to political, financial, media, and telecommunications sectors, allowing recipients to reap short-term profits. This scandal was exposed last June and involved 27 political figures, with a total bribery amount reaching tens of billions of yen.

In court, the defendants admitted that they or their relatives had received unlisted shares from Recruit Cosmos Company and expressed regret for the negative consequences. However, they denied the prosecutors' allegations of bribery or corruption, pleading not guilty. The several political figures who were sued also denied that Recruit Company had provided any special favors.

According to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Nakajima decided in September 1986 to distribute unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos Company to political figures and others closely related to the company as a token of gratitude for their support. The prosecutors believe that defendants such as Fujimori used their positions to provide favorable conditions for Recruit Company's business development and accepted gifts—unlisted shares—in return, constituting a bribery offense.

Today, opposition parties in Japan issued statements on the court's public trial of the Recruit bribery case, hoping for a fair trial and a thorough investigation into the entire case. They also demanded that the court summon former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who is implicated in the case, and that prosecutors release all investigation materials.

Japan has experienced 10 major political bribery scandals since the war, with the Recruit bribery case being the one with the most significant impact on the political landscape.

Local opinion holds that the Recruit bribery case is extensive and complex, and the court's trial of the case will be a lengthy process.

    利案审理全面展开
    新华社记者　蒋豫浙
    日本东京地方法院今天开始审理利库路特贿赂案的核心问题——利库路特公司前会长江副浩正同前内阁官房长官藤波孝生和国会议员池田克也的行贿受贿问题。至此，东京地方法院对日本战后最大贿赂案的审理工作已经全面展开。
    东京地方法院把利库路特贿赂案分为4个部分进行审理：1、政界部分，被告有利库路特公司前会长江副浩正、前内阁官房长官藤波孝生、前公明党国会议员池田克也、前利库路特公司秘书室长小野敏广；2、日本电信电话公司部分，被告是前日本电信电话公司会长真藤恒；3、文部省和日本电信电话公司部分，被告为前文部省次官高石邦男、前日本电信电话公司董事长谷川寿彦和式场英、前第一金融公司社长小林宏；4、劳动省部分，被告有前劳动省事务次官加藤孝、前利库路特公司社长室长辰已雅朗、前劳动省课长鹿野茂。上述12名被告是被检察当局确认为有行贿或受贿罪的。东京地方法院对于日本电信电话公司、文部省和日本电信电话公司、劳动省三部分的公审已于日前开始。
    利库路特公司是从一家广告代理店发迹的，目前是日本较有影响的一家信息和不动产集团公司。该公司的创办人江副浩正为了谋求事业的进一步发展，在中曾根执政时期，曾向政界、金融界、新闻界和电讯界等散发了大量子公司的未上市股票，使接受股票者在短期内获取暴利。这桩丑闻是去年6月被揭露的，涉及的政界要人就有27人，贿赂总金额达数十亿日元。
    在法庭上，被告们承认本人或亲属等曾接受利库路特宇宙公司的未上市股票，对因此而产生的不良后果表示歉意。但他们均否认检察当局提出的行贿或受贿意图，申辩自己无罪。被起诉的几位政界要人都否认为利库路特公司提供过特别的方便。
    据东京地方检察厅调查，江副浩正是1986年9月决定将未上市的利库路特宇宙公司股票分发给与该公司关系密切的政界要人等，作为对该公司关照的感谢。检察当局认为，被告藤波等人利用职权，为利库路特公司的事业发展提供了便利条件，并接受谢礼——未上市股票，已购成受贿罪。
    今天日本在野各党纷纷就法院公审利库路特贿赂案一事发表谈话，希望法院公正审理，彻底查清整个案件的内幕。他们还要求法院传询与此案有牵连的前首相中曾根康弘，要求检察机关公布全部搜查材料。
    日本战后一共发生过10起涉及政界要人的贿赂丑闻，其中利库路特贿赂案是对日本政坛冲击面最大的一桩丑闻。
    此间舆论认为，利库路特贿赂案涉及面广，案情又十分复杂，法院对于该案的审理将是旷日持久的。
