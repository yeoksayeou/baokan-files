In the year that is about to end, Latin America has seen a continuous development of democratic trends. After making breakthroughs in the peace process in Central America, the region now faces new dangers. The economic crisis is particularly severe. In the 1990s, Latin America will encounter new challenges. This was the view expressed by scholars at a situation discussion held recently by the Institute of Latin American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

In 1989, the Latin American economy continued to deteriorate. Scholars attending the meeting pointed out that this was mainly reflected in the decline in the economic growth rate, which is estimated to be only 0.2%, and the per capita GDP is 10% lower than it was a decade ago. Inflation rates have risen, with countries like Peru and Brazil experiencing inflation rates in the thousands. Although the debt crisis has eased, the burden remains heavy. Capital has flowed out in large quantities, and domestic investment rates have declined. Most countries' economic adjustments have had limited effects. It is expected that the economic situation in Latin America will not improve significantly in 1990.

This year, 14 Latin American countries held elections. Under the influence of international détente and the people's demand for change under a democratic system, most countries' elections were relatively smooth. People's political awareness has increased, and the political parties participating in the elections have accumulated political experience. Many attendees believe that although the democratization process in Latin America will not be smooth, democratically elected governments will continue to face serious challenges such as overcoming economic crises. However, the trend towards democratization is irreversible and will further strengthen in the future.

Some scholars attending the meeting pointed out that before September of this year, the peace process in Central America made significant progress. The presidents of the five Central American countries held two meetings, reaching agreements on holding early elections in Nicaragua and disbanding anti-government forces, reflecting the strong desire for peace in the region. Due to the continued support of the United States for the anti-government forces in Nicaragua and its insistence on interfering in Central American affairs, the negotiations between the Nicaraguan government and the anti-government forces failed. Additionally, the civil war in El Salvador escalated, casting a shadow over the peace in the region. The situation has become more complex. It is generally estimated that the elections in Nicaragua will be held as scheduled next year, the way to resolve the conflict in El Salvador lies in political solutions, and the peace in Central America will slowly advance in the process of opposing U.S. interference.

Scholars attending the meeting also discussed how, under the pressure of external interference, debt, and economic crises, Latin American countries have strengthened their unity. The trend towards regional integration has developed, aiming to enhance their ability to resist the superpowers and jointly cope with changes in the international political and economic landscape, and to meet new challenges.

### 我国拉美学者在讨论会上认为  拉丁美洲面临挑战

    我国拉美学者在讨论会上认为
    拉丁美洲面临挑战
    本报讯　在即将过去的一年中，拉丁美洲的民主化趋势不断发展，中美洲和平进程有所突破之后又面临危险，经济危机十分严重。进入90年代，拉美将遇到新的挑战。这是学者们在中国社会科学院拉丁美洲研究所近日举行的形势讨论会上提出的看法。
    1989年拉美经济继续恶化。与会学者认为，这主要表现在经济增长率下降，估计只达0.2％，人均国内生产总值比10年前减少10％；通货膨胀率上升，秘鲁、巴西等国年通货膨胀率已达到4位数；债务危机虽有缓解，但负担仍很沉重；资金大量外流，国内投资率下降等，大多数国家进行的经济调整成效不大。预计1990年拉美经济状况难以有大的好转。
    今年有14个拉美国家举行大选，在国际缓和趋势和人民要求在民主制度下进行变革的推动下，大多数国家的选举比较顺利，人民参政意识增强，参加选举的政党积累了政治经验。许多与会者认为，虽然拉美民主化进程不可能一帆风顺，民选政府将继续经受克服经济危机等严重考验，但民主化的潮流是不可逆转的，今后还将进一步加强。
    出席讨论会的一些学者指出，今年9月以前中美洲和平进程有了突破性的进展，中美洲5国总统举行了两次会议，对尼加拉瓜提前举行选举和遣散反政府武装达成了协议，反映了本地区人民实现和平的强烈愿望。由于美国继续支持尼加拉瓜反政府武装，坚持干涉中美洲事务的政策，尼政府与反政府武装的谈判失败，加之萨尔瓦多内战升级，使中美洲地区的和平又添阴影。形势更趋复杂。一般估计，明年尼加拉瓜大选将如期举行，解决萨尔瓦多冲突的出路在于政治解决，中美洲和平将在反对美国干涉的过程中缓慢前进。
    与会的学者们还谈到，在外部干涉以及债务和经济危机的压力下，拉美国家增强了团结，地区一体化的趋势有发展，以图加强抗衡超级大国的力量，共同对付国际政治经济格局发生的变化，迎接新的挑战。
