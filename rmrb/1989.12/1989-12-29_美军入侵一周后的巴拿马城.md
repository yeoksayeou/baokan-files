One week has passed since the U.S. military invaded Panama. The reporter drove through the streets of the capital and saw scars of war everywhere, with devastation all around.

Important areas of the capital are filled with U.S. military outposts and tanks. The newly established civilian government is temporarily operating from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building on the outskirts of the city center. The square and streets around the office building are surrounded by barbed wire, with layers of American soldiers in camouflage uniforms, faces painted, and armed with automatic rifles. Tanks are positioned at street corners, and some have sandbag fortifications. Helicopters hover low, creating a deafening noise.

From residential areas to commercial districts, there are still no police maintaining order and traffic. Most pedestrians and vehicles have white cloths draped over them, taking detours to avoid being shot by the U.S. military or snipers.

The original headquarters of the National Defense Forces, which was the first target of the U.S. military's heavy bombardment on December 20, has most of its buildings destroyed. The street-facing side of the ruins is riddled with bullet holes. The balcony next to General Noriega's office has been blown away, with remnants of sandbag fortifications still visible, indicating that his loyal "Mountain Boys" camp had fought fiercely with the U.S. military. The area still resembles a battlefield. Inside and outside the walls, there are U.S. soldiers and tanks, with strict security measures in place. The surrounding area is the Chorillo district, which is closest to the Canal Zone and home to many black and mixed-race residents. At least six residential buildings and houses have been reduced to rubble by the U.S. military, leaving nearly 3,000 refugees homeless.

The original headquarters of the National Defense Forces' National Intelligence Directorate in the Canal Zone, below the Ancon Hill, was also a major target of the U.S. military's attack. Now, only a few steel columns and a pile of rubble remain. The Amador Fortress originally had one of Noriega's offices, where there was a fierce battle in the early hours of December 20. Today, the U.S. military has heavily fortified the area, preventing reporters from entering, so it is unknown whether it has been destroyed.

After the U.S. invasion, the Panamanian police force was disbanded, plunging the entire city into a state of chaos. Criminals, escaped prisoners, and various thugs took advantage of the situation to loot extensively. They broke open iron doors, smashed windows, first looting food and clothing, then furniture and daily necessities, and finally holding guns to loot televisions, VCRs, refrigerators, and other high-end household appliances. As a result, about 70-80% of supermarkets and shops of all sizes were affected. The Colon Free Zone was also looted, with even container ships at the docks not spared. According to unofficial estimates, in just one week, the loss from looting private shops alone amounted to two or three billion dollars.

The U.S. military's night raid on the densely populated capital district resulted in the deaths of many residents who were caught off guard in their sleep. According to figures released by the U.S., Panama had a total of over 300 deaths, with countless injuries. However, according to rumors among Panamanian residents, the number of casualties is several times higher. Just as Panamanian civilians were preparing to buy Christmas goods and celebrate the holiday according to tradition, they were brutally attacked and killed by the U.S. military. Hundreds of families' holiday reunions turned into tragedies of family destruction. Without even having time to set up a Christmas tree, they had to mourn the loss of their loved ones. This is the Christmas gift that the U.S. government, which claims to champion "human rights" and "democracy," has given to the people of Panama!

    美军入侵一周后的巴拿马城
    新华社记者　胡泰然
    美军重兵入侵巴拿马，时满一周。记者驱车首都街头，只见战痕遍地，满目疮痍。
    首都重要地段，美军岗哨林立，坦克成群。新成立的文人政府，暂在市中心外交部大楼办公。办公楼四周广场、街道全用铁丝网包围起来，里外几层都是身穿迷彩服、打着花脸、手拿自动冲锋枪的美国兵，街口街角布满坦克，有的还有沙袋堆起的工事。直升机低空盘旋，震耳欲聋。
    从居民区到商业区，仍看不到警察值勤维持治安和交通秩序。街上行人和车辆大多打着白布，绕道穿行，以防美军开枪和少数反美冷枪手射击。
    在12月20日首当其冲、遭到美军猛烈轰击的原国防军司令部，大部楼房被摧毁，临街一面的断垣残壁上弹痕累累。原国防军司令诺列加将军办公室旁的阳台被炸垮一大半，那里还残留着沙袋工事，可见忠于他的“山地好汉”营曾与美军激烈战斗。这里现在依然如同战场。院墙内外满是美军和坦克，戒备森严。周围地区是与运河区贴得最近、住着许多黑人和混血人的乔里略区，至少有6处居民楼和平房被美军炸成废墟，近3000难民流离失所。
    运河区安孔山下的原国防军全国调查局总部也是美军重点进攻对象，现在只残存几根钢筋柱和一片瓦砾。阿马多尔要塞原有诺列加一处办公室，20日凌晨曾有激战。现今美军重兵封锁，不让记者进入，是否炸毁，不得而知。
    美军入侵后，打散了巴拿马警察部队，全城陷入无政府混乱状态。社会渣滓、监狱逃犯、各种歹徒乘机大肆抢劫。他们撬开铁门，打破玻璃，先抢食品、服装，接着抢家具和日常用品，最后持枪抢劫电视机、录相机、冰箱等高级家用电器，以致百分之七、八十的超级市场和大小商店遭殃。科隆自由区也被抢盗，连码头集装箱也未幸免。据非官方估计，近一周来，仅私人商店被抢，损失就达二、三亿美元。
    美军夜袭人口密集的首都市区，使大批在酣睡中的居民来不及逃难，惨遭杀害。据美方透露出来的数字，巴拿马总共死亡300多人，伤者难计其数。而据巴拿马居民传闻，伤亡数字要高出几倍。正当巴拿马和平居民购买年货、准备按传统习惯过圣诞节的时候，却横遭美军残酷袭击和杀戮，成百家庭的节日团聚变成家破人亡的悲剧，没来得及布置圣诞树，就不得不嚎啕痛哭为亲人带上了黑纱。这就是高唱“人权”和“民主”的美国政府带给巴拿马人的圣诞礼物！　（新华社巴拿马城12月27日电）
