Edition: 1

This national conference on the exchange of experiences in comprehensive agricultural development is being held right after the conclusion of the Central Work Conference and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The main task of this conference is to seriously study and resolutely implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform," to study how to further advance comprehensive agricultural development, promote agricultural production, and ensure the sustained and stable development of the rural economy. This will lay a solid foundation for rectification and deepening of reform. I will focus on three main points.

First, the current situation and tasks of agriculture

Regarding the situation in agriculture, various aspects have been closely watched and discussed in recent years. Summarizing the general views, the basic understanding of the agricultural situation can be outlined as follows:

(1) Significant achievements have been made. Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, and especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's agricultural development has achieved remarkable results, similar to the achievements in other fields. Currently, the basic needs of the vast majority of farmers have been met, and a considerable number of people have more than enough to eat. A portion of the population has reached a moderately prosperous living standard. With only 7% of the world's arable land, China has solved the food and clothing needs of 22% of the world's population. This is a truly remarkable achievement. This year, the summer grain and early rice harvests increased, but the autumn grain harvest decreased significantly due to severe disasters in Northeast China and parts of North China. It is estimated that the total grain production for the year will still be higher than last year, with the possibility of reaching the historical high of 1984. Cotton, oilseeds, livestock products, and some economic crops also increased compared to last year. Overall, it is a moderately good year. This is the result of various regions, departments, and industries seriously implementing the spirit of the National Rural Work Conference last year, further emphasizing agriculture, strengthening leadership in agriculture, and the hard work of hundreds of millions of farmers. This is a hard-won achievement that must be fully affirmed.

(2) Agriculture faces many problems. First, since 1985, agricultural production has been in a state of stagnation, and the supply-demand contradiction of agricultural products has become increasingly prominent. Second, the basic conditions for agricultural production are deteriorating. Arable land is decreasing year by year, irrigation areas are shrinking, and the flood control capacity of rivers and the drainage capacity of farmland are weakening. Many places suffer from severe soil erosion and ecological degradation. In many places, the area of green manure cultivation is declining, and the input of organic fertilizer is insufficient, leading to a general decline in soil fertility. Third, the material foundation is weak, and the momentum for development is severely lacking. The problems in agriculture today are no longer just about minor repairs. The fundamental issue is that the comprehensive production capacity is insufficient to reach a new level. The solution lies in realistically starting with the construction of infrastructure and improving production conditions. Fourth, there are also many problems in the macroeconomic and social environment. For example, the imbalance between industry and agriculture is severe, as well as the irrational price system for agricultural products, the chaotic price increases of agricultural production materials, the arbitrary levies and fees imposed on farmers, and the inadequate promotion and application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements. In summary, there are many problems.

(3) There is significant potential for development. First, among the existing arable land in China, about two-thirds are low-yield fields, totaling over 1 billion mu. If all of these are initially improved, at least 75 billion kilograms of grain can be increased. Second, the development and utilization of various agricultural resources are still very insufficient. China still has 500 million mu of cultivable wasteland, over 4 billion mu of usable grasslands and grassy slopes, 85 million mu of freshwater areas suitable for aquaculture, and 30 million mu of coastal tidal flats. The rational development and utilization of these resources will greatly increase agricultural production capacity. Third, there is considerable potential for increasing production through reasonable adjustment of agricultural structure, improvement of cultivation systems, and local adaptation to increase the planting index. Fourth, the potential for scientific and technological increases in production is even greater. Fifth, there is also significant potential in terms of investment, including funds and materials.

(4) It is entirely possible to achieve sustained and stable development of Chinese agriculture. We must recognize that over the past 40 years, China's agricultural development has laid a good foundation, and the potential for agricultural development is still considerable. The production enthusiasm of 800 million farmers is high, and especially now, there is a consensus in society to strengthen the foundational position of agriculture. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee has decided that the entire Party and the whole nation will mobilize to do a good job in agriculture. These are all very favorable conditions. Therefore, it is wrong to be blindly optimistic about the situation in Chinese agriculture, believing that agriculture has already passed the critical point or taking agricultural problems lightly. It is also incorrect to believe that Chinese agriculture is in crisis and to be pessimistic about its development prospects. Our attitude is to affirm achievements, face problems, boost morale, and strengthen work. As long as we fully utilize the favorable conditions and make long-term, unremitting efforts, it is entirely possible for Chinese agriculture to achieve sustained and stable development and step by step reach a new level.

China is a country with a population of 1.1 billion. Solving the food problem is always the top priority of the national economy. And solving this problem must rely on domestic efforts and our own strength. We must never forget this fundamental national condition at any time. Moreover, from the perspective of completing the task of rectification and deepening reform, we must first focus on agriculture. Over the past 40 years, our economy has undergone several adjustments. Each adjustment began with agriculture, which then drove and promoted improvements and development in other areas. This is a rule. This adjustment must also follow this path. Only by quickly achieving new developments in agriculture can we increase the effective supply in the market, which is beneficial for stabilizing and even reducing the retail prices of food and other agricultural-related commodities. This is beneficial for suppressing and eliminating inflation and achieving the basic goals of rectification and deepening reform. It can be said that if agriculture breaks through first, everything else will follow. From a long-term perspective, to maintain the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy, we must resolutely build a solid agricultural foundation. Since the founding of the country, we have experienced several instances of industrial overheating, where industry developed too rapidly, and the agricultural foundation was weak, making it difficult to support, leading to imbalances and forcing adjustments. This is a lesson we must firmly learn. In summary, solving the food and clothing needs of 1.1 billion people requires developing agriculture, completing the task of rectifying and deepening the reform of the national economy requires developing agriculture, and ensuring the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy requires developing agriculture. We must quickly develop agriculture. In any case, we must strive to achieve a new breakthrough in grain and cotton production next year to end the stagnant situation. This resolve must be made, and every effort must be made to achieve it.

Second, the issue of comprehensive agricultural development

China's agricultural development began in the 1950s and 1960s and achieved significant results. Entering the 1980s, especially in recent years, it has entered a larger-scale comprehensive development phase and achieved remarkable results. It can be said that this is the first step of comprehensive agricultural development. Starting from 1988, the State Council decided to use the land occupation tax remitted to the central government as the agricultural comprehensive development fund (originally known as the land development and construction fund) to carry out agricultural comprehensive development. This can be considered the second step. In 1988, the state launched development projects in 11 major areas, including the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, the Sanjiang Plain and Songliao Plain in Northeast China, as well as Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Xinjiang. In 1989, development projects were launched in eight other areas, including Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Hainan, and the Yellow River Delta. In the future, development will also be carried out in other regions with better resource conditions. Currently, in addition to the regions where the state provides key support for development, many regions are not waiting for others and are developing agriculture based on their local conditions and their own strengths. The state also attaches great importance to this development and has adopted some encouraging policies. It can be said that comprehensive agricultural development is flourishing across the country, and the situation is very encouraging.

Comprehensive agricultural development involves two main aspects: first, improving the existing low-yield fields to increase output; second, developing and utilizing new agricultural resources. According to preliminary development plans, by the end of the century, we may be able to improve 3 billion mu of existing low-yield fields, cultivate 600 million mu of cultivable wasteland, plant 200 million mu of trees, improve 500 million mu of grasslands, and increase the effective irrigation area by 600 million mu. Water and soil erosion and ecological environmental damage will be basically controlled. Achieving the above plans, China's arable land can maintain a balance between new increases and non-agricultural use. If done well, agricultural development can bear nearly half of the agricultural increase.

Comprehensive agricultural development is a new undertaking. The overall requirement is to take the development of planned commodity economy as the guiding ideology, implement the spirit of reform and opening up, and explore a new path suitable for China's actual situation. Based on the experiences of various places and in light of new circumstances, should we focus on the following aspects:

(1) Leadership must pay attention, and rely on the masses. This is an important guarantee for the success of comprehensive agricultural development. Facts show that where leadership pays attention, where organization and mobilization of the masses are good, the enthusiasm of the masses for development is high, efficiency is high, quality is good, investment and labor are more, and the development effect is significant. The funds for comprehensive agricultural development should be raised from multiple channels, including the central government, local governments, collectives, and individuals. Local governments should not focus only on asking for money and materials from higher authorities. They should face the masses, actively mobilize the masses to invest and work, and organize farmers to vigorously carry out basic construction projects such as water conservancy, afforestation, and improvement of low-yield fields. They should implement labor accumulation, which is the main body of investment.

(2) The guiding ideology and policies must be clear. The management mode should be adopted for agricultural development, and the input of funds should be linked to benefits. For operational funds, they should be used on a cost-recovery basis and circulated and rolled over, so that less money can do more things and greatly improve the efficiency of fund use; the focus should be on improving low-yield fields, with the main goal of increasing the production of grain, cotton, oil, and meat. Both short-term increases in agricultural product production and strengthening the momentum for agricultural development should be considered; unified planning and concentrated, contiguous construction of bases should be carried out, and projects should be arranged in accordance with actual conditions and local conditions; the competitive mechanism should be introduced, projects should be tendered, and contracts should be implemented. Open development should be carried out, external funds should be appropriately utilized, and cooperation with developed regions and large and medium-sized cities should be encouraged.

(3) Scientific management should be implemented, development and governance should be combined, and social, ecological, and economic benefits should be considered. The overall development plan and annual implementation plan should be formulated after repeated investigations and studies, and the plan should be established on a solid scientific basis. Agricultural development funds should be used relatively concentratedly, not scattered like pepper, and management should be strengthened, with special funds used for special purposes and not misappropriated. Every effort should be made to improve the efficiency of fund use. Special attention should be paid to ecological benefits, and new water and soil erosion should not be caused. Development and governance should be combined. While vigorously carrying out water conservancy construction and soil improvement, attention should be paid to afforestation and the repair of farm roads, and comprehensive governance of mountains, water, soil, fields, forests, and roads should be implemented. To carry out the scientific management work of comprehensive agricultural development, various levels of agricultural development leading groups should strengthen the leadership and training of personnel engaged in agricultural development work, and improve their management level and professional skills.

(4) Attention should be paid to the construction of infrastructure and scientific and technological input. New agricultural development should pay attention to strengthening infrastructure construction from the beginning, and build high-quality, stable, and high-yield farmland with a high starting point. To achieve high-quality development, attention to scientific and technological input is very important. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the China Agricultural University have sent a large number of scientific and technological personnel to participate in comprehensive agricultural development, especially in the improvement and governance of low-yield fields in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, and have done a lot of work with good results. The facts fully prove that without scientific and technological input, high-quality agricultural development is impossible. Agricultural development must absorb the participation of scientific and technological personnel, and promote the application of excellent varieties and advanced and applicable scientific and technological achievements, as well as water-saving irrigation and mechanized operations. Especially for large-scale farmland development, there are conditions for the promotion and application of advanced agricultural scientific and technological achievements, and more attention should be paid to scientific and technological input.

(5) New comprehensive agricultural development should start with moderate-scale management in various forms. New agricultural development, especially large-scale agricultural development, should start with appropriate concentration and scale management. This is beneficial for adopting advanced scientific and technological methods, implementing mechanized operations, improving the commodity rate, and achieving the best economic benefits.

Third, rural work in the coming year

The central task of rural work next year is to seriously implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, resolutely implement the principles of rectification and deepening reform, and strive to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture. This will promote the sustained and stable development of the rural economy and social stability. To this end, we must focus on two aspects:

(1) We must adhere to and stabilize the basic economic policies in rural areas and deepen and improve rural reform. Currently, stabilizing the basic economic policies in rural areas and stabilizing the minds of 800 million farmers is very important. This is a matter of overall importance. Only by stabilizing the basic policies in rural areas can we stabilize the minds of 800 million farmers; only by stabilizing the minds of 800 million farmers can we develop agriculture; only by developing agriculture can we stabilize the entire economy; only by stabilizing the economy can we contribute to greater social and political stability. Therefore, we must be very cautious about rural policy issues and maintain the continuity and stability of basic economic policies. Why must the current basic policies of the Party in rural areas remain stable? Because these basic policies, in general, are still suitable for the level of productive forces in rural society, are conducive to protecting and mobilizing the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, and promote the further development of rural productive forces. We must organize rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers to study Jiang Zemin's speech on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, correctly understand the Party's basic policies, and clearly announce that the Party's basic policies and guidelines in rural areas will not change. Reform will continue to deepen, giving 800 million farmers a "peace of mind." We must emphasize:

The policy of implementing the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output as the main form and various forms of production responsibility system remains unchanged. Ten years of practice has proven that the household contract responsibility system is suitable for the current level of productive forces in most rural areas in China and meets the wishes of the broad masses of farmers. It should be maintained and continuously improved. Currently, we should actively develop the rural socialized service system, improve the dual management system of combining collective and individual management, and further give play to the advantages of the collective economy and the enthusiasm of farmers for production. This is both an objective requirement for the development of agricultural production and a necessary trend for the development and progress of the social economy. Various regions should, according to their actual needs and possibilities, gradually establish a multi-level, multi-form, and multi-economic component socialized service system. We should organize and mobilize various forces to provide farmers with services in production technology, production materials supply and reasonable use, agricultural product storage, sales, processing and value-added, market information, and management. In regions with conditions, according to the principle of voluntariness of farmers, we can prudently promote moderate-scale management and the development of new collective economies. In summary, the mode of production and operation should be treated differently according to different regions and industries, and classified guidance should be provided, not "one-size-fits-all."

The policy of allowing and encouraging some regions and some people to get rich first, with the goal of common prosperity, remains unchanged. Poverty is not socialism, and egalitarianism is not socialism. Our goal is to achieve common prosperity, but achieving this goal will have a sequence, and it is not possible for everyone to become prosperous at the same time. We allow and encourage some regions to implement the relevant policies and guidelines of the Party and the state, fully utilize their favorable conditions, and become prosperous first. We allow and encourage some farmers to become rich first through honest labor and legal business operations. This is conducive to inspiring and driving other regions and farmers to gradually develop and become prosperous, walking the road of socialist common prosperity. There are many examples of this. We must have a correct understanding of this issue. We oppose the polarization of the rich and the poor, but allowing some people to get rich first is not the same as polarization; currently, it is necessary to solve the problem of unfair social distribution, but it is not to change the policy of allowing some people to get rich first; it is strictly forbidden to get rich through illegal means and without labor, which is not in conflict with the Party's policy of enriching the people, but is to ensure the healthy implementation of this policy. We must strictly distinguish the boundaries of this aspect.

The policy of "never relaxing grain production and actively developing multiple operations" to steadily adjust and optimize the rural industrial structure remains unchanged. Developing agriculture, we must first pay special attention to developing grain production. The grain problem is solved, and the overall situation is stable, the industrial structure is adjusted, and multiple operations are developed, which have a reliable foundation. What is worth emphasizing is that without a stable grain planting area, there will be no stable grain production. For arable land suitable for grain, we must insist on planting grain and not abandon grain for fruit or aquaculture. Poor mountainous areas should strengthen agricultural infrastructure and strive to improve the self-sufficiency rate of grain and reduce grain imports. The adjustment of the rural industrial structure should be based on reality and local conditions, and should not be overly advanced. In this regard, some places have had lessons in recent years, which must be learned from, and we must proceed steadily.

The policy of encouraging and guiding the healthy development of township enterprises remains unchanged. In recent years, township enterprises have become an important pillar of rural economic development and an important component of the national economy. During the rectification and deepening of reform, we must seriously implement the principle of "adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement" determined by the central government, and actively guide their healthy development. Currently, it is necessary to close down and transform township enterprises that have repeated construction, compete with large enterprises for raw materials and energy, cause serious pollution, have high consumption, and produce low-quality products. We should control the excessively high development speed, adjust the industrial structure, and improve management. This is conducive to the healthy development of township enterprises. During the rectification and deepening of reform, we must prevent two tendencies in township enterprises: one is to indiscriminately "cut down" without distinction; the other is to focus on excavating internal content and improving efficiency, but to build more new factories again. Of course, for the central and western regions where township enterprises started late and are still weak, appropriate development scale should be allowed, and we should not adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Township enterprises should be based on the development of agricultural product processing industries that do not compete with state-owned large-scale industries for raw materials, as well as other resource-based and labor-intensive industries.

The policy of adhering to the public ownership system as the mainstay while developing multiple economic components remains unchanged. China is in the primary stage of socialism, and the ownership structure is dominated by the public ownership economy. This must be adhered to; but at the same time, it is allowed to develop multiple economic components under this premise. Individual and private economies are beneficial and necessary supplements to the socialist economy. We must give full play to their positive role, but we must also strengthen guidance and management and limit their negative aspects that are not conducive to the development of the socialist economy.

The policy of combining planned economy with market regulation for the purchase and sale of major agricultural and sideline products remains unchanged. In rural reform, the system of unified purchase and allocation of agricultural products was abolished, and a planned contract purchase system was implemented for major agricultural products such as grain and oil. At the same time, the scope and scale of market regulation were expanded, which injected vitality into the development of the rural economy. We must affirm the achievements of this reform, but some problems have also emerged, such as various "wars." To solve the problems that have arisen, it is entirely necessary to take corresponding measures, but it is not to restore the old system of unified purchase and allocation, but to deepen and improve the reform of the agricultural product purchase and sale system. To activate the circulation of agricultural products, for the agricultural products that have been liberalized, we must continue to insist on multi-channel and fewer-link operations, actively cultivate the rural market, and support farmers to participate directly in circulation.

The above-mentioned "six unchanged" policies are not all-inclusive, but these are the basic economic policies in rural areas that rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers are concerned about. It is necessary to reaffirm them. At the same time, it must also be explained that in the past ten years, there have been some problems in rural reform and the development of the rural economy, and there have been some imperfections in reform measures and policies that need to be further solved and improved. This is also necessary. The new measures we take in new situations are the deepening and improvement of reform, not the change of basic policies. This point must also be made clear to stabilize people's minds and develop rural productive forces.

(2) We must comprehensively grasp the various aspects of rural work. Currently, rural work is complex, with many things to do, but I think the most important thing is to grasp the following aspects, which can be summarized as "six simultaneous efforts":

(1) We must simultaneously grasp conventional agriculture and development agriculture. In developing conventional agriculture, we must focus on effective measures to increase production. First, use excellent varieties; second, apply more fertilizer, including accumulating and applying more organic fertilizer, and strive to cultivate and improve soil fertility; third, promote model cultivation technology and breeding technology; fourth, implement reasonable water-saving irrigation in areas with irrigation conditions; fifth, in areas where mechanized operations are possible, we must pay attention to the use of agricultural machinery to further improve agricultural production efficiency; sixth, we must strive to improve the planting index. In water-scarce areas, we must pay attention to the development of dryland farming, and in the south, we must also pay attention to the development of winter farming and regenerated rice production. These aspects, if grasped, can quickly improve production capacity and achieve immediate results. We must further improve the construction of commercial bases that play a major role in improving the supply level of Chinese agricultural products. The construction of animal husbandry and forestry must be further strengthened. State-owned farms are an important force in the development of Chinese agriculture and must be further improved.

Regarding development agriculture, this has been mentioned earlier and will not be repeated here.

(2) We must simultaneously grasp material input and technological input. We must pay attention to and increase the input of organic fertilizer. Currently, the decline in soil fertility in China is a very serious problem, and we must strive to apply more organic fertilizer. At the same time, relevant departments must strive to increase the production of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films, and ensure their supply. Currently, these three agricultural production materials are under monopoly management, and their positive role must be affirmed, but there are also some problems. This method should continue to be implemented, and the existing problems should be improved through measures.

Funds are multi-level, including the input of the central government, local governments, collectives, and farmers. None of these inputs can be missing or replaced. In addition to the original channels of agricultural funds, we must open up more channels to increase input. Agricultural development funds should be used for special purposes by both the central and local governments, and the amount should only be increased each year, not reduced. Increasing input into agriculture, the main body is the rural collective economy and the masses of farmers. We must vigorously mobilize farmers to actively invest and work, and develop agricultural production. Especially, we must actively advocate labor accumulation, which can be carried out in various forms such as voluntary labor and labor in lieu of relief, and mobilize the masses to carry out agricultural infrastructure construction.

Developing Chinese agriculture requires policy, input, but more importantly, it requires science and technology. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out in discussing the agricultural issue: "Ultimately, it may be science that solves the problem." Due to various reasons, many scientific and technological achievements have not been well promoted and utilized, and there is still considerable potential in this regard. The urgent task is to seek effective forms to quickly promote successful and applicable agricultural scientific and technological achievements on a large scale, making them real productive forces. Various levels of government must strengthen the leadership of the promotion of scientific and technological achievements, and relevant departments must closely cooperate and actively support. Recently, the State Council issued a decision to promote agricultural science and technology, and it is hoped that various regions and departments will seriously implement it. The relevant departments of the State Council have also established an agricultural science, technology, and education coordination group, and the coordination group should play its role, organize the forces of all parties, and create conditions for the trial and promotion of agricultural scientific and technological achievements. In recent years, some places have created some experiences in promoting agricultural scientific and technological achievements. Various regions can actively promote and continuously explore and create more effective forms according to their local conditions, increase scientific and technological input into agriculture, and promote the rapid development of agriculture.

(3) We must simultaneously grasp the economic development of developed regions and the economic development of poor regions. We cannot neglect one for the other. In terms of national work, we must grasp this; in terms of the work of a region, we must also grasp this. For poor regions, most places have abundant natural resources and a surplus of labor, but lack talent and technology. For developed regions, there is talent, technology, and good management, but raw materials are insufficient, energy is tight, and labor is not enough. If both sides benefit from each other and cooperate, making up for each other's shortcomings, the economy will develop together. In recent years, various regions have done a lot of work in this regard and achieved good results, which should be actively promoted.

Poverty alleviation work must be firmly grasped. Poverty alleviation should focus on economic development, while also doing a good job in disaster relief and relief work. The living arrangements for poor regions and poor households must be taken care of and cannot be neglected. Problems must be prevented. Next year is the key year to achieve the goal of solving the problem of most people in poor regions having enough food and clothing during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period proposed by the State Council. Various regions, levels, and industries must strengthen, not weaken, their poverty alleviation and relief work. The various funds and materials for poverty alleviation at the national and local levels must not be reduced and must be properly arranged and used.

(4) We must simultaneously grasp flood control and drought resistance. Our country is large, and water and drought disasters occur every year. Various regions must enhance their disaster resistance capabilities and be prepared for disaster and bumper harvests. Flood control of major rivers must be done well to ensure no problems. We must strengthen agricultural water conservancy infrastructure construction. Last year, various regions focused on this and achieved good results. This year, the State Council also made a decision to vigorously carry out agricultural water conservancy infrastructure construction, and various regions have paid attention to it and taken action. We must continue to grasp this, persist in it, but we must also pay attention to cherishing manpower and resources, arrange appropriately, and reasonably bear the burden, seeking practical results.

(5) We must simultaneously grasp the development of agricultural production and family planning work. Solving China's agricultural problems and grain problems must strictly control the rapid growth of the population, and both opening up sources and saving are important.

First, we must firmly grasp family planning work. This work must be tightly grasped and cannot be relaxed. We must plan the development of production and the control of population growth simultaneously and do a good job in both. Any consideration of only the production problem and not the population problem is not a complete view of the rural economy. China's rural areas, especially poor regions, are key areas for overpopulation, and effective measures must be taken to do a good job in family planning and control the rapid growth of the population, achieving the dual benefits of increasing production and controlling population.

Second, we must truly protect arable land. Arable land is a resource that our generation and future generations rely on for survival and must be protected. In recent years, the situation of large-scale occupation of arable land has improved, but it must be further strictly controlled. We must combine the development and construction of new arable land with the strict control and conservation of arable land, and strive to stabilize the area of arable land and protect existing farmland. Strengthening administrative management and levying arable land occupation tax is one way, and another way is to consider, through legislation, delineating permanent arable land that cannot be occupied.

Third, we must give equal importance to increasing grain production and saving grain. We must take measures to tap the potential in this regard. We cannot only focus on increasing production without saving.

(6) We must simultaneously grasp material civilization construction and spiritual civilization construction. Next year, various regions must, in economic work, firmly grasp the development of agriculture, especially the development of grain and cotton production, and end the stagnant situation as a hard task. Regions that export grain should strive to export more, and regions that import grain should further grasp grain production and saving, and strive to import less. Strengthening agriculture first requires that various levels of Party committees and governments must put the agricultural issue on the main agenda and keep a close watch. Especially at the county and township levels, the main energy should be focused on the development of agriculture, especially grain and cotton production. Large and medium-sized cities should also fully attach importance to and strengthen agriculture, especially the production of vegetables and other main food products. Where conditions permit, various forms should be adopted to strengthen and develop grain production. In summary, all must unswervingly and unconditionally implement the central government's policy of tilting towards agriculture and truly implement it. Doing a good job in agriculture is the responsibility of the entire Party and society, not just the responsibility of the agricultural department and the broad masses of farmers. We must call on and organize various departments and industries to strongly support agriculture.

There is one issue that needs to be emphasized here. That is, we must strive to reduce the social burden on farmers. After several years of recovery, farmers' lives have indeed improved, and some have gradually become prosperous, but we must have a correct estimate of the prosperity of farmers and not overestimate it. We must study and determine an effective method to firmly prohibit the arbitrary expansion of deductions and miscellaneous charges on farmers.

Currently, in rural areas, we must seriously study Jiang Zemin's speech on National Day and the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and unite the thoughts of the broad masses of cadres and farmers in this regard. We must carry out policy education, situation education, and education on the overall concept and rule of law for the broad masses of cadres and farmers, advocate hard work and wealth, adhere to the socialist road, change customs, abide by laws and regulations, promote the prosperity of the rural economy, and maintain social stability in rural areas.

We must work hard to strengthen the construction of rural grassroots organizations and give full play to the role of Party branches and villagers' committees. Currently, there are still many weak and dispersed grassroots organizations in rural areas, and many policies and work are not implemented among the masses. We must strengthen the construction of grassroots organizations. The vast majority of Party members and cadres in rural areas are good or relatively good, and we must affirm their mainstream and contributions, while also kindly pointing out their existing problems and shortcomings, adopting educational methods and guidance methods to solve the problems in their ideological, work methods, and work styles. As for a few who violate laws and regulations, commit embezzlement and bribery, they must be seriously dealt with. We must further strengthen the construction of grassroots leading cadres, strengthen the training of grassroots cadres, improve their policy level and work ability, and make them excellent organizers and leaders who connect with the masses of farmers on behalf of the Party and the government.

Comrades! Next year is the last year of the implementation of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Let us seriously implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, work together, strive hard, and work solidly to further advance comprehensive agricultural development and achieve excellent results in the bumper harvest of agriculture next year, stepping into the brilliant "Eighth Five-Year Plan" construction period.

    在全国农业综合开发经验交流会议上的讲话（摘要）
    田纪云
    （一九八九年十一月二十七日）
    同志们：
    这次全国农业综合开发经验交流会，是在刚刚结束的中央工作会议和党的十三届五中全会后召开的，会议的主要任务，就是认真学习和坚决贯彻五中全会及《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》的精神，研究如何把农业综合开发进一步搞上去，把农业生产搞上去，保持农村经济持续稳定发展，以为治理整顿和深化改革打下良好的基础。下面，我着重讲三个问题。
    第一，当前农业形势和任务
    关于农业形势问题，近年来各方面都很关注，议论也很多，归纳一下，对农业形势的基本看法，大体是这么个概念。
    （一）成绩很大。建国40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，同各方面取得举世瞩目的成就一样，我国农业也有了很大的发展。现在绝大多数农民的温饱问题已经解决，有相当一部分人已温饱有余，一部分人达到了小康生活水平。我们以只占世界7％的耕地，解决了占世界22％人口的吃饭穿衣问题。这就是一件很了不起的事情。今年全国夏粮、早稻增产，秋粮因东北三省和华北部分地区灾害严重减产较多，预计全年还是比去年增产的，总产量有可能接近1984年历史最高水平，棉花、油料、畜产品和一些经济作物也比去年增产，总的来看，是个中等偏上年景。这是各地区、各部门、各行各业认真贯彻去年全国农村工作会议精神，进一步重视农业，加强对农业的领导，为农业升温和亿万农民艰苦努力的结果，是来之不易的。这一点要充分加以肯定。
    （二）农业面临的问题不少。一是自1985年以来农业生产一直处于徘徊局面，农产品供需矛盾越来越突出。二是农业生产的基本条件日趋恶化。耕地逐年减少，灌溉面积减少，河道防洪能力和农田排涝能力减弱。不少地方水土流失严重，生态环境恶化。相当多的地方，绿肥种植面积下降，有机肥投入不足，土地肥力普遍降低。三是物质基础薄弱，发展后劲严重不足。农业问题到今天，已不是修修补补就可以解决的。根本问题主要出在综合生产能力不足以登上新的台阶。要解决，只能实实在在地从建设基础设施，改变生产条件做起。四是在宏观经济环境和社会环境方面存在的问题也不少。例如，工农业比例严重失调，以及农产品价格体系不合理，农用生产资料乱涨价，对农民乱摊派、乱收费等。还有，农业科技成果的推广应用，也不够理想。总之，存在的问题不少。
    （三）发展潜力不小。一是我国现有耕地中，中低产田约占2／3，即有10多亿亩，如果全部进行初步改造，至少可增产粮食750亿公斤。二是各种农业资源的开发利用还很不充分。我国还有宜农荒地5亿亩，可利用的草原和草山草坡40多亿亩，可供养殖的淡水水面8500万亩，沿海滩涂3000万亩。这些资源的合理开发利用，将为农业增加巨大的生产能力。三是合理调整农业结构，改进耕作制度，因地制宜提高复种指数，增产潜力也相当大。四是科技增产的潜力更大。五是投入方面的潜力也很大，包括资金、物资投入。
    （四）实现我国农业持续稳定发展，是完全可能的。要看到，建国40年来我国农业发展已经有了一个良好的基础，农业的发展潜力还相当大，8亿农民的生产积极性高，特别是现在要求切实加强农业的基础地位，已成为全社会的共识，这次中央五中全会又决定全党全国齐动员办好农业。这些都是十分有利的条件。所以，对我国农业的形势，持盲目乐观的态度，认为农业已经过关或者对农业问题掉以轻心是错误的，认为我国农业生产发生了危机，对农业发展的前景持悲观态度也是不符合实际、没有根据的。我们的态度是，肯定成绩，正视问题，振奋精神，加强工作。只要充分利用有利条件，作长期的、坚持不懈的努力，我国农业实现持续稳定发展，一步一步登上新的台阶，是完全可能的。
    我国是一个拥有11亿人口的大国，解决吃饭问题始终是国民经济的头等大事。而解决这个问题，必须立足于国内，依靠我们自己。任何时候都不能忘记我们这个最基本的国情。另外，从完成治理整顿的任务来说，也必须首先把农业搞上去。40年来，我们的经济经历过几次调整。而每次调整都是首先把农业搞上去，以此带动与促进其他方面的改善与发展。这是一条规律。这次调整也必须这么做。只有尽快地使农业有一个新发展，才能增加市场有效供给，有利于稳定以至降低食品及其它与农业有关的商品零售价格，有利于抑制和消除通货膨胀，实现治理整顿的基本目标。可以说，农业率先突破，全棋皆活。从长远来看，国民经济要保持持续稳定协调发展，必须下决心建设一个坚强可靠的农业基础。建国以来，我们已经几次出现过工业过热，上得太快，而农业基础薄弱，难于支撑，导致比例失调，被迫进行调整的局面。这是我们必须牢牢记取的教训。总之，解决11亿人的吃穿问题需要把农业搞上去，完成国民经济的治理整顿任务需要把农业搞上去，为使国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展需要把农业搞上去。尽快把农业搞上去，这就是我们面临的任务。无论如何，明年粮棉生产要争取有个新的突破，结束徘徊局面，这个决心一定要下，并千方百计为此而努力。
    第二，农业综合开发问题
    我国的农业开发，在五六十年代就搞了，而且取得了很大成绩。进入80年代以后，特别是近几年来进入了更大规模的综合开发，取得了显著成效。可以说，这是农业综合开发的第一步。从1988年开始，国务院决定将上交中央的耕地占用税作为农业综合开发基金（原称土地开发建设基金），进行农业综合开发，这可以说是第二步。1988年，国家在冀、鲁、豫、苏、皖5省的黄淮海平原、东北的三江平原、松辽平原以及浙江、广西、新疆3省（区）等11大片立项进行开发；1989年又在四川、湖北、湖南、江西、宁夏、内蒙古、海南及黄河口三角洲等8片地区立项进行开发。以后还要在其它一些资源条件较好的地区进行开发。现在，除了国家重点扶持开发的地区外，许多地区不等不靠，从本地实际出发，依靠自己的力量也在搞农业开发。对这种开发，国家也是很重视的，采取了一些鼓励政策。可以说，农业综合开发正在全国各地蓬勃地展开，形势是十分喜人的。
    农业综合开发，一是对现有的中低产田进行改造，提高产出率；二是开发利用新的农业资源。按照初步的开发规划测算，到本世纪末，我们有可能改造现有中低产田3亿亩，开垦宜农荒地6000万亩，植树造林2000万亩，改良草场5000万亩，增加有效灌溉面积6000万亩，水土流失和生态环境破坏得到基本控制。实现上述规划，我国耕地可以做到新增与非农业占用持平，如果搞得好的话，依靠农业开发有可能承担近一半的农业增产任务。
    农业综合开发是一项新的事业，总的要求是，应以发展有计划的商品经济为指导思想，贯彻改革、开放的精神，走出一条符合我国实际情况的新路子。根据各地探索的经验，结合新的情况，是不是应该把握好以下几个方面：
    （一）要领导重视，依靠群众。这是搞好农业综合开发的重要保证。大量事实说明，凡是领导重视的地方，凡是组织群众、发动群众比较好的地方，群众搞开发的积极性就高，效率就高，质量就好，投资投劳就多，开发成效就大。农业综合开发资金，要中央、地方、集体、个体多渠道筹集。各地搞农业开发，不要只把注意力放到向上面要钱要物上，要面向群众，积极发动群众投资投劳。组织农民大力开展兴修水利、植树造林、改造中低产田的基本建设，实行劳务积累，这是投资的主体。
    （二）指导思想和方针政策要明确。要采取经营方式搞农业开发，实行资金投入与效益挂钩，凡属经营性的资金，要有偿使用，循环滚动，这样可以少花钱、多办事，大大提高资金使用效益；要坚持以改造中低产田为重点，以增产粮棉油肉为主要目标，既考虑短期内增加农产品产量，又为增强农业发展后劲打下基础；要统一规划、集中连片地建设基地，从实际出发、因地制宜地安排项目；要引入竞争机制，对项目进行招标，实行承包，并搞开放式的开发，适当利用外资，鼓励与发达地区、大中城市联合开发。
    （三）要实行科学管理，开发与治理相结合，社会效益、生态效益、经济效益并重。制定总体开发规划和年度实施计划，要反复调查研究，评估论证，使规划建立在切实可行的科学基础上。对农业开发资金，要相对集中使用，不能撒“胡椒面”，并且加强管理，专款专用，不得挪用，千方百计提高资金使用效益。特别要注重生态效益，不能造成新的水土流失。要开发和治理相结合。既大力兴修水利、改良土壤，又注意植树造林和整修田间道路，实行山水土田林路综合治理。为了搞好农业综合开发的科学管理工作，各级农业开发领导小组要加强对从事农业开发工作的领导和工作人员的培训，提高他们的管理水平和业务能力。
    （四）要注重基础设施建设和科技投入。新的农业开发，一开始搞就要注意加强基础设施建设，要建成高质量的稳产高产农田，起点要高。实现高质量的开发，注重科技投入是非常重要的。中国科学院、中国农科院和北农大派出大批科技人员参加农业综合开发，特别是对黄淮海地区的中低产田开发与治理，做了大量工作，获得了很好效果。事实充分说明，没有科技的投入就不可能有高质量的农业开发。农业开发，一定要吸收科技人员参加，要因地制宜地推广良种和先进适用的科技成果，以及节水灌溉和机械化作业等。特别是大面积的农田开发，具有推广应用农业先进科学技术的条件，更应重视科技投入。
    （五）新的农业综合开发，一开始就要实行多种形式的适度的规模经营。新的农业开发，特别是大面积的农业开发，一开始就要适当集中，搞规模经营。这样，有利于采取先进的科学技术，实行机械化作业，提高商品率，获得最佳的经济效益。
    第三，明年的农村工作
    明年农村工作的中心任务是，认真贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，坚决执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，千方百计夺取农业丰收，促进农村经济持续稳定发展和农村社会的安定。为此，要着重抓好两条：
    （一）要坚持和稳定党的农村基本经济政策，深化和完善农村改革。当前稳定农村基本经济政策，稳定八亿农民的心，是非常重要的，这是关系到大局的问题。只有稳定农村基本政策，才能稳住八亿农民的心；只有把八亿农民的心稳住，才能把农业搞上去；只有把农业搞上去，才能把整个经济稳住；只有把经济稳住，才有利于社会和政局更加稳定。因此，对农村政策问题要十分谨慎，要保持基本经济政策的连续性和稳定性。为什么党在农村的现行基本政策必须保持稳定呢？就是因为这些基本政策，从总体讲，目前仍然适应农村社会生产力发展水平，有利于保护和调动广大农民的社会主义生产积极性，促进农村生产力进一步发展。要认真组织农村干部和广大农民学习江泽民同志建国四十周年的讲话和党的五中全会精神，正确理解党的基本政策，明确宣布党在农村的基本方针、基本政策不改变，改革要继续深化，给八亿农民吃个“定心丸”。要着重重申：
    实行以家庭经营为主的多种形式联产承包责任制的政策稳定不变。十年的实践证明，家庭联产承包责任制适应我国目前绝大多数农村的生产力水平，符合广大农民的意愿，应当保持稳定并不断完善。当前，应积极发展农村社会化服务体系，完善统分结合的双层经营体制，进一步发挥集体经济优越性和农民生产积极性。这既是农业生产发展的客观要求，又是社会经济发展和进步的必然趋势。各地要根据实际需要和可能，逐步建立多层次、多形式、多种经济成分的社会化服务体系。要组织动员各方面的力量，为农民提供生产技术措施方面的服务，提供生产资料供应和合理使用方面的服务，提供农产品储存、销售、加工增值和市场信息方面的服务，以及经营管理方面的服务。在有条件的地方，根据农民自愿的原则，可以稳妥地推进适度规模经营和发展新的集体经济。总之，生产经营方式，要根据不同地区、不同产业，区别对待，分类指导，不能“一刀切”。
    以共同富裕为目标，允许和鼓励一部分地区和一部分人先富起来的政策稳定不变。贫穷不是社会主义，平均主义也不是社会主义。我们的目标是实现共同富裕，但实现这个目标会有先有后，不可能同时一下子都富裕起来了。允许和鼓励一部分地区执行党和国家的有关方针政策，充分利用其有利条件，率先发展和富裕起来，允许和鼓励一部分农民依靠诚实劳动和合法经营率先致富，这样做有利于鼓舞和带动其他地区和其他农民也逐步发展和富裕起来，走社会主义共同富裕的道路。要举这方面的例子，那是很多的。对这个问题要有一个正确的认识。我们反对贫富两极分化，但富裕有先有后同两极分化并不是一回事；当前，解决社会分配不公问题是必要的，但并不是改变允许一部分人先富起来的政策；严禁靠非法手段、不劳而获“富起来”，这同党提倡的富民政策并不矛盾，而是保证这项政策的健康执行。对这方面的一些界限，要严格区分。
    “绝不放松粮食生产，积极发展多种经营”，继续稳步调整优化农村产业结构的政策稳定不变。发展农业，首先要特别重视发展粮食生产。粮食问题解决了，稳定大局、调整产业结构、发展多种经营就有了可靠的基础。当前值得强调的是，没有稳定的粮食种植面积，就没有稳定的粮食产量。对于宜粮耕地要坚持种粮，不要弃粮种果、养鱼。贫困山区要加强农田基本建设，尽可能提高粮食自给率，减少粮食调入。调整农村产业结构，要从实际出发，因地制宜，不要搞超前行动。在这方面，这几年有的地方也是有过教训的，一定要汲取，要稳步前进。
    鼓励和引导乡镇企业健康发展的政策稳定不变。这些年来，乡镇企业已经成为我国农村经济发展的重要支柱和国民经济的重要组成部分。治理整顿中，对乡镇企业要认真贯彻执行中央确定的“调整、整顿、改造、提高”的方针，积极引导其健康发展。当前，关停并转那些重复建设、与大企业争原材料、争能源、污染严重、消耗高、产品质量低劣的乡镇企业，控制过高的发展速度，调整产业结构，改善经营管理，恰恰是有利于乡镇企业健康地发展。在治理整顿中，对乡镇企业要防止两种倾向：一是不加区别地“大杀大砍”；二是不以挖掘内涵、提高效益为主，而又去搞更多的新厂。当然，对中、西部乡镇企业起步较晚、还很薄弱的地区，应该允许适当的发展规模，不能“一刀切”。乡镇企业要立足于发展不与国家大工业争原料的农产品加工业，以及其他资源型、劳动密集型产业。
    坚持在以公有制为主体的前提下发展多种经济成分的政策稳定不变。我国处于社会主义初级阶段，所有制结构以公有制经济为主体，这一条必须坚持；但同时，又允许在这个前提下发展多种经济成分。个体经济、私营经济是对社会主义经济的有益的、必要的补充，要发挥它们的积极作用，当然，也要加强引导和管理，限制其不利于社会主义经济发展的消极方面。
    对主要农副产品实行计划经济与市场调节相结合的购销政策稳定不变。在农村改革中，取消了农产品统购派购制度，对粮食、油料等大宗农产品实行了有计划的合同定购，同时扩大了市场调节的范围和规模，这给农村经济发展注入了活力。对这项改革取得的成绩要肯定，当然也出现了一些问题，例如这个大战、那个大战，等等。为了解决出现的问题，采取一些相应措施是完全必要的，但并不是恢复旧的统购派购制度，而是深化和改善农产品购销制度的改革。为了活跃农村商品流通，对已经放开的农产品，要继续坚持多渠道、少环节经营，积极培育农村市场，支持农民直接参与流通。
    以上讲了“六个稳定不变”，当然还不全，这些都是农村干部和广大农民所关心的农村基本经济政策，重申一下是必要的。但同时也要说明，在过去十年中，我们在农村改革和发展农村经济的某些方面也存在一些问题，在改革措施和政策方面也有不完善的地方，需要进一步加以解决和改善，这也是必要的。我们在新情况下采取的一些新措施，就是改革的深化和改善，而不是改变基本政策。这一点也要讲清楚，以利于安定人心，发展农村生产力。
    （二）要全面抓好农村的各项工作。当前农村工作千头万绪，有许多事情要做，但我认为，最重要的是抓好以下几方面的工作，概括一下，就是坚持“六个一起抓”：
    （一）常规农业和开发农业一起抓。在发展常规农业方面，要着重抓好有效的增产措施。一是使用优良品种；二是增施肥料，包括广积增施有机肥，千方百计培植和提高地力；三是推广模式化栽培技术和养殖技术；四是有灌溉条件的地方，实行合理节水灌溉；五是凡是有条件实行机械化作业的，要重视使用农业机械，以进一步提高农业生产效率；六是要千方百计提高复种指数。缺水的地方要注意发展旱作农业，南方还要重视发展冬季农业和再生稻生产。这几方面抓上去了，就可以迅速提高生产能力，收到立竿见影的效果。对提高我国农产品供给水平有重大作用的商品基地建设要进一步搞好。牧业和林业建设要进一步加强。国营农场是发展我国农业的一支重要力量，要进一步把它办好。
    关于开发农业，前面已经讲过了，这里不再详述了。
    （二）物资投入和科技投入一起抓。要重视和增加有机肥的投入。目前我国地力下降是个十分严重的问题，要千方百计多施有机肥。同时，各有关部门要努力增产化肥、农药和农膜等农用生产资料，并切实搞好供应。目前对这三种农用生产资料实行专营，其积极作用要肯定，当然也还存在一些问题。这个办法还要继续实行，存在的问题要采取措施加以改进。
    资金投入是多层次的，包括中央、地方、集体和农民的投入。哪一方面的投入都不可缺少、不可代替。除了原有的农业资金渠道外，要多方开辟渠道，增加投入。农业发展基金，中央和地方都要专款专用，每年只能有所增加，不能减少。增加对农业的投入，主体是农村集体经济和农民群众。要大力动员农民积极投资投劳，发展农业生产。特别是要积极提倡进行劳动积累，可以用义务劳动和以工代赈等多种形式，发动群众搞农田基本建设。
    发展我国农业，要靠政策，靠投入，但更重要的是靠科学技术。小平同志最近在谈到农业问题时指出：“最终可能是科学解决问题”。由于种种原因，目前还有许多科技成果没有很好地推广利用，这方面的潜力还相当大。当务之急是，寻求切实有效的形式把成功的、适用的农业科技成果在大范围内迅速推广，使之成为现实的生产力。各级政府要加强对科技成果推广工作的领导，各有关部门要密切配合，积极给予支持。最近，国务院发出了搞好科技兴农的决定，希望各地、各部门认真贯彻执行。国务院有关部门还成立了农科教统一协调小组，协调小组要发挥作用，组织好各方的力量，为农业科技成果的试验、推广创造条件。这几年，一些地方创造了一些推广农业科技成果的经验，各地可根据本地情况，积极推广并不断探索和创造更有效的形式，增加对农业的科技投入，促进农业迅速发展。
    （三）发达地区经济发展和贫困地区经济开发一起抓。不能顾此失彼。就全国的工作来讲，要这样抓，就一个地区的工作来讲，也要这样抓。就贫困地区来说，大多数地方自然资源比较丰富，有充裕的劳动力，但缺人才，缺技术。就发达地区来说，有人才，有技术，善管理，但原材料不足，能源紧张，劳动力不够用。如果双方互利互惠，联合起来，取长补短，经济就会得到共同发展。近几年，各地在这方面已经做了很多工作，取得了良好效果，应积极提倡。
    扶贫工作要坚持抓好。扶贫要着重搞好经济开发，同时要搞好救灾和救济工作。对贫困地区和贫困户的生活要安排好，不可大意，保证不出大的问题。明年是实现国务院提出的“七五”期间解决贫困地区大多数群众温饱问题的最关键一年。各地、各级和各行各业对扶贫济困工作，只能加强，不能削弱；国家和地方用于扶贫的各项资金和物资不要减少，并妥善安排和使用好。
    （四）防汛与抗旱一起抓。我们国家面积大，水旱等灾害年年都有，各地必须增强抗灾能力，立足于抗灾夺丰收。大江大河等防汛一定要搞好，确保不出问题。一定要加强农田水利基本建设。大搞农田水利基本建设，去年各地抓了一下，效果不错。今年国务院又作出了大搞农田水利基本建设的决定，各地都比较重视，已经行动起来了。要继续扎扎实实地抓，坚持不懈地抓，当然，要注意爱惜民力、民财，适度安排，合理负担，讲求实效。
    （五）发展农业生产与计划生育工作一起抓。解决我国农业问题、粮食问题，一定要严格控制人口过快地增长，同时要开源与节流并重。
    首先，一定要抓好计划生育工作。这项工作一定要抓得很紧，决不能放松。必须把加快生产的发展和控制人口的过快增长统筹规划，同时做好。任何只考虑生产问题，不考虑人口问题，都不是完整的农村经济观。我国农村，尤其是贫困地区，是超生的重点地区，一定要采取有效措施，做好计划生育工作，控制人口过快增长，以收到增加生产和节制人口的双重效益。
    二是要切实保护好耕地。耕地是我们当代人、也是子孙后代赖以生存的资源，必须予以保护。这几年大量滥占耕地的情况虽有所好转，但仍要进一步严格控制。要把开发建设新的耕地同严格控制占用、节约使用耕地结合起来，千方百计稳定耕地面积，保护好现有农田。加强行政管理、征收耕地占用税是一个办法，另外也可以考虑，通过立法的办法划定永久性农用耕地，就是不能占用。
    三是增产粮食与节约用粮要并重。一定要采取措施，挖掘这方面的潜力。不能只埋头抓增产，而不去抓节约。
    （六）物质文明建设与精神文明建设一起抓。明年各地在经济工作中，要把大力发展农业、特别是发展粮棉生产，结束徘徊局面，作为一项硬任务来抓。调出粮的地区争取多调出一些，调入粮食的地区，要进一步抓好粮食生产和节约用粮，争取少调入一些。加强农业，首先需要各级党委和政府必须把农业问题摆上主要日程，盯住不放。特别是地县一级领导，要把主要精力放在发展农业特别是粮食、棉花生产上。大中城市，也要充分重视和加强农业，特别要搞好蔬菜生产和其他主要副食品的生产，有条件的要采取多种形式加强和发展粮食生产。总之，都要坚定不移地、不折不扣地执行中央决定的向农业倾斜的政策，并真正落到实处。办好农业是全党全社会的事情，不单单是农业部门和广大农民的事情，要号召和组织各个部门、各行各业都来大力支援农业。
    有个问题在这里强调一下。就是要努力减轻农民的社会负担。经过几年的休养生息，农民的生活确实有所改善，有的逐步富裕起来了，但对农民的富裕程度要有一个正确估计，不能估计过高。要研究确定一个有效办法，坚决禁止对农民随意扩大提留和乱摊派。
    当前，农村抓精神文明建设，要认真学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话和党的十三届四中、五中全会精神，使农村广大干部和群众的思想统一到这方面上来。要对广大干部和农民进行政策教育、形势教育和全局观念、法制观念教育，提倡勤劳致富，坚持走社会主义道路，移风易俗，遵纪守法，促进农村经济繁荣，维护农村社会安定。
    要下功夫加强农村基层组织建设，充分发挥党支部和村民委员会的作用。现在农村还有相当一部分基层组织软弱涣散，许多工作、政策落实不到群众中去，一定要加强基层组织建设。农村的广大党员和干部，绝大多数是好的和比较好的，要肯定他们的主流和贡献，同时善意地指出他们存在的问题和不足之处，采取教育的方法、引导的方法，解决他们认识上、工作方法、工作作风方面存在的问题。至于少数人违法乱纪、贪污受贿等，则当严肃处理。要进一步加强基层领导班子建设，加强对基层干部的培训，提高他们的政策水平和工作能力，使之成为党和政府联系农民群众的优秀的组织者和领导者。
    同志们！明年是执行“七五”建设计划的最后一年。让我们认真贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，齐心协力，艰苦奋斗，扎扎实实地工作，以把农业综合开发进一步搞上去、夺取明年农业丰收的优异成绩，跨入光辉的“八五”建设时期。
