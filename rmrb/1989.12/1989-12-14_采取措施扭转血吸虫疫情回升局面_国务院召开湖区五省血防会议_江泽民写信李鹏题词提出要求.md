The State Council convened a schistosomiasis prevention and control meeting for five provinces in the lake region. Jiang Zemin wrote a letter and Li Peng provided a slogan with requirements.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 13 — A schistosomiasis prevention and control meeting for the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu in the lake region, chaired by the State Council, opened today in Nanchang. Attendees included deputy governors from the five provinces responsible for schistosomiasis prevention and control, as well as officials from the Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Materials, Ministry of Light Industry, and the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, along with officials from 12 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in schistosomiasis-endemic areas, and officials from Wuhan and Nanjing responsible for schistosomiasis prevention and control.

On December 11, General Secretary Jiang Zemin wrote a letter to the schistosomiasis prevention and control meeting for the five provinces in the lake region (the full text will be published separately). Premier Li Peng provided a slogan for schistosomiasis prevention and control: "Build on achievements, summarize experiences, take action, and strive to prevent and eradicate schistosomiasis." Vice Chairman Wang Renhe of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also provided a slogan for schistosomiasis prevention and control.

Vice Secretary of the State Council Li Chang'an delivered the opening speech. He said that to implement the instructions of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the State Council leaders, mobilize the governments at all levels in schistosomiasis-endemic areas to take active measures, and effectively carry out schistosomiasis prevention and control work to reverse the passive situation of the severe rebound in schistosomiasis, the State Council decided to convene this schistosomiasis prevention and control meeting for the five provinces in the lake region.

Li Chang'an said: The main agenda of this meeting is to hear reports on the schistosomiasis prevention and control work in the lake region; discuss the "Decision on Strengthening Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work" and the "Comprehensive Schistosomiasis Control Plan for the Lake Region"; study the draft of schistosomiasis prevention and control regulations; establish a joint prevention and control leadership group for the five provinces in the lake region, and other issues.

Minister of Health Chen Minzhang gave a lengthy speech at the meeting. He said: Schistosomiasis is a serious parasitic disease that endangers people's health. Before liberation, 12 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions south of the Yangtze River were affected by this disease. Mao Zedong's poem "Sending the Plague God Away" describes the rampant spread of schistosomiasis in rural areas. After the founding of New China, Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other older-generation proletarian revolutionaries attached great importance to schistosomiasis prevention and control work.

Chen Minzhang pointed out that after more than 30 years of arduous efforts, China's schistosomiasis prevention and control work has achieved remarkable results. Four provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions—Guangdong, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangxi—have reached the "eradication standard." While acknowledging the achievements, we must also clearly see that the task of schistosomiasis prevention and control is still very arduous. Since 1980, the epidemic situation has been stagnant, and in some areas, it has shown a serious rebound trend.

Chen Minzhang analyzed that the reasons for the rebound in the epidemic situation in the lake region are multifaceted. First, there is an insufficient understanding of the severity and seriousness of schistosomiasis, the long-term and arduous nature of prevention and control work, leading to a relaxed and complacent attitude, and a loosening of leadership. Second, the environment for the breeding of snails is complex, and comprehensive control is difficult, with scientific research not meeting the needs of prevention and control work. Third, human and animal prevention and control are not synchronized, and the management of human and animal feces is not strict, making it difficult to control the source of infection. Fourth, prevention and control funds are seriously insufficient, and snail-killing and disease-treatment drugs cannot be guaranteed. Fifth, the institutions and teams are not adapted to the needs of prevention and control tasks.

Letter from Jiang Zemin to the Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Meeting for the Five Provinces in the Lake Region:

The schistosomiasis prevention and control meeting for the five provinces in the lake region, chaired by the State Council, is very necessary and timely. Schistosomiasis has been prevalent in China for a long time and is extremely harmful. Since the founding of the nation, the Party and the government have always attached great importance to schistosomiasis prevention and control work, relying on the broad masses of the people and mobilizing various aspects of society, achieving great results in schistosomiasis prevention and control, fully demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system. In 1958, Chairman Mao specially wrote two poems, "Sending the Plague God Away," to praise the great achievements of Yujian County in eradicating schistosomiasis.

Preventing and controlling schistosomiasis is a long-term and arduous task. In recent years, the schistosomiasis epidemic situation in China has rebounded, and in some areas, schistosomiasis is still quite severe. The party committees and governments at all levels in the epidemic areas must attach great importance to this issue. Serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of the Communist Party, and working with the people to eradicate schistosomiasis is the responsibility that the Party and the government cannot shirk. The five provinces in the lake region are located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which are important grain-producing areas and economically developed regions in China. Therefore, not only must schistosomiasis be eradicated, but also a good ecological environment must be built, and the economy must be prosperous. The task is heavy and the road is long. I believe that as long as we can seriously summarize experiences and lessons, formulate feasible plans, take effective measures, rely on science and technology, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, strengthen leadership, prioritize prevention, and comprehensively control, we will be able to eradicate schistosomiasis in China as soon as possible and build the epidemic areas into regions with high material and spiritual civilization.

I wish the meeting a complete success.

Jiang Zemin

### 采取措施扭转血吸虫疫情回升局面  国务院召开湖区五省血防会议  江泽民写信李鹏题词提出要求

    采取措施扭转血吸虫疫情回升局面
    国务院召开湖区五省血防会议
    江泽民写信李鹏题词提出要求
    本报南昌12月13日电　记者赵相如报道：由国务院主持召开的湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、江苏湖区5省血吸虫病防治工作会议，今天在南昌开幕。参加会议的除5省主管血防工作的副省长外，还有水利部、农业部、财政部、物资部、轻工部、解放军总后卫生部等负责同志，以及血吸虫疫区12个省市区和武汉、南京市分管血防工作的负责人。
    12月11日，江泽民总书记给湖区5省血防工作会议写了一封信（全文另发）。国务院总理李鹏为血防工作题了词：“发扬成绩，总结经验，行动起来，为防治和消灭血吸虫病而努力奋斗。”政协副主席王任重也为血防工作题了词。
    国务院副秘书长李昌安致开幕词。他说，为贯彻江泽民总书记和国务院领导同志指示精神，动员血吸虫病流行区各级政府积极行动起来，采取有效措施，切实做好血吸虫病防治工作，扭转血吸虫疫情严重回升的被动局面，国务院决定召开这次湖区5省血防工作会议。
    李昌安说：这次会议的重要议题是，听取湖区血防工作情况的汇报；讨论《关于加强血吸虫防治工作的决定》和《湖区血吸虫病综合治理方案》；研究拟订血防条例；成立湖区5省联合防治领导小组等问题。
    卫生部部长陈敏章在会上作了长篇讲话。他说：血吸虫病是一种严重危害人民健康的寄生虫病，解放前长江以南的12个省、市、区流行此病。毛泽东同志《送瘟神》诗篇中的“千村薜荔人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”，正是农村血吸虫病猖獗流行的真实写照。新中国成立后，毛主席、周总理等老一辈无产阶级革命家对血防工作十分重视。
    陈敏章指出，经过30多年的艰苦努力，我国血防工作取得了举世瞩目的成绩。全国已有广东、上海、福建、广西4省、市、区达到“消灭标准”。在肯定成绩的同时，要清醒地看到目前血吸虫病防治任务还相当繁重。1980年以来疫情呈徘徊态势，局部地区呈严重回升的趋势。
    陈敏章分析说，湖区疫情回升的原因是多方面的。首先，对血吸虫的危害性、严重性，对防治工作的长期性、艰巨性认识不足，认为血防工作“差不多”了，产生了松劲麻痹情绪，放松了领导。第二，钉螺孳生环境复杂，综合治理难度大，科研不适应防治工作的需要。第三，人畜防治不同步，人畜粪便管理不严，传染源难以控制。第四，防治经费严重不足，灭螺治病药物不能保证供应。第五，机构、队伍不适应防治任务的需要。
    江泽民总书记的信湖区五省血防工作会议：
    国务院主持召开的湖区五省血防工作会议十分必要，非常及时。血吸虫病在我国流行已久，危害极其严重。建国以来，党和政府一贯重视血防工作，依靠广大群众，动员社会各方面的力量，血防工作取得了巨大的成绩，充分体现了社会主义制度的优越性。1958年，毛主席特作《送瘟神》诗二首赞扬余江县消灭血吸虫病的伟大成就。
    防治血吸虫病是一项长期艰巨的任务。近年来我国血吸虫病疫情又有所回升，一些地区血吸虫病流行仍较严重。疫区的各级党委和政府必须高度重视。全心全意为人民服务，是共产党唯一的宗旨，和人民群众一起共同努力消灭血吸虫病，是党和政府义不容辞的责任。湖区五省位于长江中下游，是我国重要的产粮区和经济发达地区，因此，不仅要消灭血吸虫病，而且要建设良好的生态环境，繁荣经济，任重道远。我相信，只要我们能够认真总结经验教训，制订可行的规划，采取有力的措施，依靠科学技术，依靠群众和发动群众，加强领导，预防为主，综合治理，坚持不懈的努力奋斗，一定能够尽快在我国消灭血吸虫病，同时把疫区建设成为具有高度物质文明和精神文明的地区。
    祝会议圆满成功。
      江泽民
