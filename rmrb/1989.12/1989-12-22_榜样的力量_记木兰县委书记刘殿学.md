On a cold winter night, the north wind howled, tearing through the night in the northern frontier, and seeping into the dilapidated old house. In the outer room, the faint sound of the mother's blanket being tucked in and her low sighs could be heard. The son, who was the county committee secretary, got up from bed and knelt by his mother's bed, feeding one piece of firewood after another into the already burning stove.

"Mom, did I wake you up again?"

The son said apologetically.

"You go back to sleep, it's almost dawn. Old bones and old flesh, it's nothing," the mother's voice trembled.

"You're over 80 years old, and I haven't been able to let you enjoy your old age. My heart..." the son's voice trembled.

"Well, this is good enough. Do you remember when we were in Bin County?"

The son didn't forget. At that time, he was the party committee secretary of Qingyang Township in Bin County, later the head of the county's organization department and a member of the county committee. A family of three generations and five people lived in two low, thatched huts, crammed onto a small mud bed, with his daughter lying at his feet for more than a decade.

"Good, I haven't forgotten," the mother murmured.

Only the mother could truly understand her son's heart. "If you forget about the poor people for the sake of your position, even if you live in a high-rise building, it won't be comfortable..."

This scene took place on a cold night at the beginning of this year. Who would have believed that the person who lit the stove for his mother at dawn was Liu Dianxue, the secretary of the Woodland County Committee in Heilongjiang Province.

Putting the Happiness of the People Above His Own

Six years ago, when Liu Dianxue, then 36, was transferred from Bin County to Woodland to serve as county magistrate, his half-truckload of worn-out belongings shocked the entire county. Liu Dianxue had only been in Woodland for a month when a ordinary worker in the county government moved his family south, and the new county magistrate moved into this rundown house. The doors and windows of the house were peeling with paint, and the roof was missing tiles, but with his mother's old wooden chest from 50 years ago and a red-painted bed table, it all seemed quite harmonious. Liu Dianxue pasted newspapers on the walls to keep his mother warm and added a bed in the hallway for himself. This was indeed better than when he was in Bin County.

Last spring, as the Lunar New Year approached, his 81-year-old mother said to him, "Dianxue, I heard that on New Year's Eve, there is a celebration, and it's very lively. When will we be able to buy a television?"

Liu Dianxue's nose stung with tears as he thought about how he had been a county-level cadre for more than a decade, and now his elderly mother had never seen a television. A sense of guilt gnawed at his heart.

His wife, Mao Shiqin, did not have a job and worked as a farmhand in the fruit farm in Bin County before coming to Woodland. Seeing his family's straitened circumstances, the higher authorities decided to arrange a job for his wife, but Liu Dianxue did not agree. He said, "Woodland is a poor county, and there are many people without jobs. If the wife of the new county committee secretary gets a job, what about the others? Let's wait until the whole county is rich."

His daughter studied at Acheng Normal School at her own expense, and the tuition alone cost more than 1,000 yuan a year. Someone gave him advice, and someone offered to help him "share the burden." Liu Dianxue dismissed it with contempt. "Communist Party cadres don't do that. The daughter grew up lying at my feet, and when she comes home, she doesn't even have a place to write. It's only natural that the child goes to school and spends my money. This is also a kind of emotional compensation for the child."

Liu Dianxue's son is an ordinary worker at the county postal service. There was once a confrontation between father and son over the son's job assignment. The son, who is 1.85 meters tall, was a key player on the basketball team in the army. When he was demobilized last year, a bank and several bureau offices were all vying to take him in. However, the son wanted to go, but the father did not agree. The son had his reasons, and the father had his theory.

"I go to the bank and the bureau because I have superior physical conditions," the son insisted.

"If your father were an ordinary citizen, your superior conditions might not exist," the father said dialectically.

"Children of cadres should also have their own ideal social division of labor," the son did not give in.

"Your ideal social division of labor, if it does not come from self-reliance, but from clinging to power, in a sense, the more ideal it is, the worse it is," the father said.

The ideological exchange between father and son finally reached a harmonious unity.

The son became a mailman, delivering letters to thousands of households. Although the salary was meager and the work was hard, the father's admonitions were not forgotten.

"One Cannot Tarnish the Reputation of Secretary Liu"

As the head of a county, no matter how poor the county is, if he wants to get rich, he can do so without lifting a finger. However, Liu Dianxue did not do so. Some people found this incomprehensible.

In the spring of 1987, just before the Lunar New Year, something happened at Liu Dianxue's house: someone had secretly thrown a piece of pork into the warehouse at night. Who was the gift-giver? Liu Dianxue thought about it for a long time. As soon as he went to work, he had someone bring in Fan Wen. This burly man from Shandong looked a bit embarrassed. During the years of learning from Dazhai, the outsider Fan Wen built a house just as the spring plowing was about to end. An angry township leader used a tractor to pull Fan Wen's new house to the ground. Fan Wen's wife fell ill, and he began his petitioning career. However, after filing a complaint for 15 years, the problem was still not resolved. Later, he found the newly arrived Liu Dianxue, who thought the problem should be solved, so he had two rooms built for him and gave him a monthly subsidy for the poor. However, the builder cut corners, and three years later the house collapsed. Fan Wen came to see Secretary Liu again, and Liu Dianxue had two brick rooms built for him.

Liu Dianxue said calmly, "Old Fan, last night someone threw a piece of pork into our warehouse. If I'm not mistaken, I think it must have been you who did it."

Fan Wen's eyes widened, and he denied it vehemently, "Secretary Liu, my family is so poor, where would I get meat to give to others?"

"Well," Liu Dianxue looked at Fan Wen, who was trying to hide his embarrassment, "if it wasn't you, then forget it. However, this is a case of bribery, and I will immediately hand it over to the Discipline Inspection Commission for investigation; if the person is found, they will be held legally responsible."

Fan Wen heard this and suddenly broke out in a cold sweat, stammering, "Secretary Liu, my big problem has been ignored for more than ten years; you came and solved it, and you did it three times. You say, if I don't find a way to thank you, do I have a heart? You eat that pork, and I'll feel better..."

Saying this, he burst into tears.

Liu Dianxue still had his messenger take the meat back.

A few months after returning the meat, one evening, someone gently knocked on the door of Liu Dianxue's house and gave his wife, Mao Shiqin, a letter, saying it was from the regional committee for Secretary Liu. Liu Dianxue came back and opened it to find 300 yuan inside. He asked his wife about the appearance of the person, and she said that because it was dark, she couldn't see clearly, but she heard a Shandong accent. Liu Dianxue frowned, and the next day he had someone bring Fan Wen in again. This time, Fan Wen refused to admit it. Liu Dianxue called in Tang, the head of the county government's security bureau, and said sternly, "Tang, someone gave me 300 yuan yesterday. You first take this money to the Discipline Inspection Commission and hand it over to the public, and then send this suspect to the detention center for interrogation." Fan Wen heard this and was stunned, his lips trembling as he said, "Secretary Liu, since you refused the pork last time, I haven't slept well for these few months. Can't you really accept this little token of my gratitude?"

Liu Dianxue said earnestly, "Old Fan, it's not that I'm not open-minded, but have you thought about it? This is not good for me, it's ruining my reputation..."

Fan Wen walked out of the county committee compound in a daze, feeling the money in his pocket and muttering to himself, "Yes, how could I ruin Secretary Liu's reputation?"

Communist Party Members Cannot Be Content with Self-Purification

Liu Dianxue has a "top secret" diary, in which he meticulously records the people who have given him gifts and the money and goods over the years; his secretary, Cui Xi, also has a diary, in which he meticulously records the dates and reasons for returning gifts on behalf of Secretary Liu.

These are things that ordinary farmers like Fan Wen cannot understand. This spring, the Discipline Inspection Commission of Songhua River Region received a letter of complaint, saying that one night two people carried large bags into the home of the usually incorruptible Liu Dianxue, and later saw Secretary Liu send them off a long way, but the next day did not see Secretary Liu or his office staff take away the gifts.

When the regional committee sent someone to investigate this matter, Liu Dianxue smiled calmly, "Thank you for the supervision of the masses." He took out a receipt. It turned out that Liu Dianxue's mother loves to eat mushrooms, and someone from a unit who went into the mountains for work, Liu Dianxue had them bring back a few pounds of mushrooms, and repeatedly reminded them to open a receipt. Liu Dianxue said that as a Communist Party cadre, if he only saw accepting gifts as a way to avoid mistakes, then his quality was obviously too low. Communist Party members should have a high moral character that even officials of past dynasties cannot compare to!

As the saying goes: if one's conduct is upright, orders are not needed; if one's conduct is not upright, orders are ineffective. Liu Dianxue's integrity and righteousness set a good example for all party members and cadres in the county. When some places were buying luxury cars, the 8 domestic cars of the Woodland County Committee and County Government had run more than ten thousand kilometers and were not replaced; when some places were building "section-level buildings" and "expert streets," the 27 county-level and above cadres in Woodland did not use public funds to build private houses, and most of them still lived in simple civilian houses. A deputy county magistrate's son got married, and the daughter-in-law came from more than 80 kilometers away by bicycle, transferring to a public bus, and finally walking into the town. A deputy secretary's house was cold and damp, and in the winter they wrapped it with plastic film, looking from a distance like a vegetable greenhouse. The county's Discipline Inspection Commission secretary went to the levee for flood control, and water entered his home more than a meter deep.

Liu Dianxue often said that Communist Party members cannot be content with self-purification, nor can they be like ascetics. When your people are prosperous, your interests are naturally included. Over the past six years, Liu Dianxue's footsteps have covered every mountain and river in Woodland, working tirelessly for the 250,000 people in the county to get rid of poverty and become prosperous.

In recent years, Woodland County has undergone a dramatic transformation. Compared to 1985: fiscal revenue increased from 3.99 million yuan to 11 million yuan this year; rice cultivation area increased from 120,000 mu to 427,000 mu this year, and last year's total grain production increased by 52%; 17 state-owned industrial enterprises all made profits, with 5 enterprises earning more than 100 million yuan in taxes and profits, and the total output value ranked second among the 9 counties and cities in the region; the number of dairy cows and yellow cows increased from 1,400 to 9,000, ranking second in the region. Education investment reached 580 million yuan, and 7 teaching buildings were built in 5 years. Two roads, Jiangnan and Jiangbei, were extended by 5.5 kilometers in the marshes, connecting Woodland and Harbin, shortening the distance by 30 kilometers, and the annual social benefits can reach tens of millions of yuan. The county installed 1,000 automatic carrier telephones, realizing the automation of rural communications. All towns and villages in the county have access to tap water or deep well water, and all government agencies, enterprises, and institutions have realized centralized heating. The per capita savings increased from 52 yuan to 253 yuan in the first half of this year. In recent years, Woodland has been consecutively awarded as the advanced county in flood control, women's work, prevention and control of local diseases, transformation of low-yield fields, improvement of social order, and advanced county in national conscription.

Woodland, originally known as the "hunting ground" in ancient Manchu, has finally changed its old face after the hard work of the Communist Party.

    榜样的力量
    ——记木兰县委书记刘殿学
    王作龙
    寒冬的一天，朔风，发疯似地撕扯着塞北的寒夜，肆虐地钻进那年久失修的老屋，外屋，隐隐传来了老母那轻轻的掩被声和低微的叹息声。身为县委书记的儿子翻身起床，半跪在母亲的炕下，把一棵一棵的柴禾填进了已经点燃的灶膛里。
    “妈，又把您冻醒了。”
    儿子歉疚地说。
    “快睡去吧，天快亮了，老骨头老肉的，一挺就过去了。”
    母亲声音发抖。
    “您老人家80多岁了，未能使您安度晚年，我这心里……”儿子声调发颤。
    “嗨，这就不错了，你忘了在宾县的时候？”
    儿子没忘。那时，他在宾县青阳乡任党委书记后任县委组织部长、县委常委。一家三代五口住在两间低矮的茅草屋里，挤在一铺小土炕上，女儿在脚下横着佝偻了十几年。
    “没忘就好。”母亲喃喃地说。
    母亲，唯有母亲，才最理解儿子的心。“要是为了官就忘了穷苦百姓，就是住着高楼大厦也不舒坦……”
    这一幕发生在今年年初的一个寒夜，谁能相信，为母亲五更烧炕的，竟是黑龙江省木兰县委书记刘殿学。
    后天下之乐而乐
    6年前，36岁的刘殿学从宾县调来木兰任县长的时候，他那半卡车破旧的家当，使全县老百姓为之一震。刘殿学来到木兰刚一月，县政府的一位普通工人举家南迁，新来县长的家就安在这破旧的房子里。房子的门窗油漆剥落，屋顶瓦片残缺，不过，配上他母亲50年前结婚用的旧木箱，刷着红油漆的炕桌，倒也显得十分和谐。刘殿学怕母亲受寒用报纸糊糊墙，他自己在走廊里加一张床，这确实比在宾县时好多了。
    去年春节临近，81岁的母亲对他说：“殿学呀，听说年三十晚上有联欢会儿，可热闹啦，咱家啥时能买一台电视呢？”
    刘殿学鼻子发酸，自己当了十来年县级干部，如今老母已是风烛残年，居然没看过电视，一种愧疚感啃噬着他的心。
    妻子毛世琴没有工作，在没来木兰前在宾县果树场做农工。看到他家拮据的生活状况，上级组织决定给妻子安排工作，但刘殿学不同意，他说：“木兰是个穷县，没工作的有的是，新来县委书记的老婆安排工作，别人怎么办？等全县富了再说吧。”
    女儿在阿城师范自费读书，每年学费就需1000多元。有人给他出主意，还有人要帮他“分担困难”。刘殿学对此不屑一顾：“共产党的干部不兴这个。女儿是在脚下横着长大的，回家连个写字的地方都没有，孩子上学花我的钱理所当然，这对孩子也是一种感情上的补偿。”
    刘殿学的儿子是县邮电局的一名普通工人。关于儿子的工作安排问题，父子之间曾有一次交锋。儿子1.85米的大个，在部队就是篮球队主力。去年复员时，有家银行和几个局机关都抢着要。然而儿子愿意去，老子不同意。儿子有儿子的理由，老子却有老子的理论。
    “我去银行、机关是因为我有优越的身体条件。”儿子当仁不让。
    “如果你父亲是普通老百姓，你的优越条件可能就不复存在。”父亲辩证地说。
    “干部子女也应有自己的理想中的社会分工。”儿子寸步不让。
    “你的理想中的社会分工，如果不是来自自强自立，而是靠攀藤附葛，在某种意义上说，这种分工越理想反而越糟糕。”
    父子之间的思想交流终于得到了合谐的统一。
    儿子当了邮递员，给千家万户送信，尽管工资微薄而又艰辛，但父亲的告诫却不敢忘怀。
    “哪能败坏刘书记的名声”
    做为一县之首，无论这个县多么贫穷，如果他想富起来，是可以不费举手之劳的。然而，刘殿学没有那样做。对此，有些人感到不可思议。
    1987年春节前，刘殿学家突然发生了一起“案子”：仓房里不知被谁在夜里偷偷地扔进一块猪肉。究竟谁是送礼人？刘殿学沉思再三。一上班，他就让人找来了范文公。这位黑红脸膛的山东大汉显得有些局促。在那农业学大寨的年月，外来户范文公在春耕即将结束之际盖起了房屋，一位镇领导怒不可遏，用拖拉机把范文公的新房拉得土崩瓦解。范文公的老婆由此得病，他也从此开始了上访生涯。然而，一状告了15年，问题一直没有得到解决。后来他找到新来的刘殿学，刘殿学觉得应该解决，就让人给盖了两间房，并按月发给困难补助。不料盖房人偷工减料，三年后房子倒了。范文公又来找刘书记，刘殿学让人又给盖了两间砖房。
    刘殿学心平气和地说：“老范，昨夜我家仓房里不知是谁扔进一块猪肉，如果没猜错，我想一定是你干的。”
    范文公眼睛瞪得溜圆，矢口否认：“刘书记，我家那么困难，哪有肉给别人送？”
    “好吧，”刘殿学看了一眼极力掩饰的范文公，“不是你就算了。不过，这是一起贿赂案，我马上交纪检委查处；如查出这个人，是要负法律责任的。”
    范文公一听，顿时脑袋冒汗了，吞吞吐吐地说：“刘书记，我10多年的大事儿没人管；你一来就给办了，而且三番两次。你说，我不想个法儿感谢你，我还有心吗？你把那猪肉吃了，我心里就好受了……”说着说着，眼泪滚了出来。
    刘殿学还是让通讯员把肉给送回去了。
    退肉后的几个月的一天傍晚，一个人轻轻敲开了刘殿学家的大门，给他妻子毛世琴一封信，说是地委捎给刘书记的。刘殿学回来拆开一看，发现里面装的是300元钱。他问妻子来人的体貌特征，妻子说因天黑没看清，只听得是山东口音。刘殿学眉头一皱，第二天又让人找来了范文公。这回，范文公死活不认账。刘殿学叫来了县政府保卫科的唐科长，严肃地说：“唐科长，有人昨天给我送300元钱，你先把这钱送纪检委交公，然后把这个怀疑对象送拘留所审查。”范文公一听傻眼了，嘴唇哆嗦着说：“刘书记，从打上次送猪肉你没收，这几个月我一直都没睡好觉，我这点心意难道你真的就不能收？”
    刘殿学语重心长：“老范，不是我不开面儿，你想过没有，你这不是对我好，是让我败坏名声啊……”
    范文公怔怔地走出了县委大院，摸着兜里的钱自言自语，
    “是呀，我哪能败坏刘书记的名声呢？”
    共产党人不能满足洁身自好
    刘殿学有一个“绝密”的日记本，那上面密密麻麻详细地记着几年来送礼的人以及钱物；他的秘书崔希有也有一个日记本，那上面详细地记着替刘书记往回退礼的年月日以及退礼时的苦衷。
    这些，是诸如范文公这样的普通农民所难以理解的。今年春天，松花江地区纪检委接到一封举报信，反映一天晚上有两个人挟着大包走进了素来廉洁的刘殿学的家门，后来看到刘书记送出老远，而第二天并没见刘书记及办公室来人取走礼物。
    地委派人来查询此事时，刘殿学坦然地笑了：“感谢群众的监督。”说着掏出了一张单据。原来刘殿学的母亲爱吃蘑菇，有一个单位的人公出进山，刘殿学让捎了几斤蘑菇，并一再叮嘱开了收据。刘殿学说，做为一个共产党的干部，如果把收礼仅仅看成是怕犯错误，那显然素质太低了，共产党人应具有历代官吏都无法比拟的高尚品格！
    俗话说：其身正，不令则行；其身不正，虽令不行。刘殿学的清风正气，为全县党员干部带了好头。当一些地方纷纷购置豪华车时，木兰县委、县府的8台国产旧车跑了十几万公里仍不更换；一些地方“科级楼”、“能人街”拔地而起时，木兰县的27名处级以上干部没用公家一分钱盖私房，大多仍住在简陋的民房之中。一位副县长儿子结婚，儿媳是从80多公里的乡下骑自行车转搭公共汽车、最后步行来镇内的。一位副书记家里茅屋寒冷，冬天用塑料薄膜围了一圈，远看竟像一个蔬菜大棚。县纪委书记上堤防汛，家里进水达一米多深。
    刘殿学常说，共产党人不能满足洁身自好，也不能学苦行僧，当你那一方人民富庶之际，你的利益自在其中。6年来，刘殿学的足迹踏遍了木兰的山山水水，为全县25万人民脱贫致富殚精竭虑。
    几年来，木兰县终于发生了翻天覆地的变化。仅与1985年相比：财政收入由399万上升到今年的1100万；水稻面积由12万亩增加到今年的42.7万亩，去年粮食总产增加52％；17家国营工业企业户户盈利，其中5家利税超百万，总产值居全区9县市第二位；奶牛、黄牛由1400头发展到9000头，居全区第二位。教育投资580万元，5年建了7所教学楼。还把江南江北的哈同（哈尔滨至同江）、哈萝（哈尔滨至萝北）两条公路在沼泽地里延长5.5公里，使木兰和哈尔滨的距离缩短30公里，年社会效益可达百万之巨。县里上了1000门自动载波电话机，实现了乡村通讯自动化。全县乡镇和各村都吃上了自来水或深井水，机关企事业全部实现了集中供热。人均存款由52元上升到今年上半年的253元。几年来，木兰被先后评为省抗洪先进县，妇女工作先进县，防治地方病先进县，改造低产田先进县，社会治安好转先进县，全国征兵先进县。
    木兰，古满语称为“狩猎场”的地方，经过共产党人的艰苦治理，终于旧貌变新颜了。
