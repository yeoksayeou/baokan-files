November 1st marked the fifth anniversary of the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our country and the United Arab Emirates. For the peoples of China and the UAE, who are separated by thousands of miles, this year is a year of great joy.

One day in September 1984, our embassy in Oman suddenly received a phone call from the UAE chargé d'affaires, saying he had received instructions from his home country to invite the Chinese ambassador to Abu Dhabi to meet with Foreign Minister Rashid, but he did not know what the meeting was about. At that time, I was the ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman and had visited the UAE capital Abu Dhabi and the commercial city of Dubai many times, meeting with many high-level officials, but I had not yet met Foreign Minister Rashid. In the past, whenever the issue of developing relations between the two countries was discussed, the officials on the other side would say that economic and cultural relations should be developed first, and that establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries was just a matter of timing, and it would naturally happen when the conditions were ripe. We estimated that this time, Foreign Minister Rashid's invitation to meet with me might have two considerations: one was to explore the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with us; the other was to express gratitude for China's support in the UN Security Council for the resolution proposed by the six Gulf countries to maintain freedom of navigation in the Gulf.

When I arrived at the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Abu Dhabi as invited, Foreign Minister Rashid warmly welcomed me. He happily said that President Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan believed that the time for the UAE and China to establish diplomatic relations was ripe. The President appreciated China's policy of respecting the sovereignty, independence, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. China has consistently advocated for the unity of the Arab people, supported the just cause of the Arabs, opposed the aggression of the Israeli authorities, supported the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and rebuild their country, and supported the resolution proposed by the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries to maintain freedom of navigation in the Gulf. All of this has won the trust of the Arab people and the people of the UAE.

After two rounds of smooth negotiations, I and the Acting Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the UAE, Yagoub Kindi, signed the agreement to establish formal diplomatic relations between the two countries on October 25, 1984. The two countries simultaneously issued a news release on the establishment of diplomatic relations on November 1st. This was the third country in the Gulf region, after Kuwait and Oman, to formally establish diplomatic relations with our country.

Before the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the UAE, economic and trade exchanges, as well as cultural exchanges between the two countries, had already developed significantly. Our country had held China Economic and Trade Exhibitions in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and had also established a Chinese Trade Representative Office in Dubai. In 1980, China opened a route to Western Europe via Sharjah. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation carried out construction contracting business in Abu Dhabi. In 1983, the China Oriental Song and Dance Troupe was invited to participate in the UAE National Day celebrations and performed for a week, causing a sensation in the UAE. The Chinese Muslim delegation had visited the UAE twice and had cordial meetings with the Muslim brothers of the UAE. All these exchanges and activities promoted mutual understanding and trust between the two peoples, creating conditions for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

In the five years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the relations between the two countries have developed further, with frequent exchanges in various fields such as economy, politics, trade, and culture, laying a solid foundation for the development of relations between the two countries. Looking to the future, I believe that the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries will develop further, especially in economic cooperation, which has great potential waiting to be developed. The tree of friendship between the two countries will forever be evergreen.

    回忆中国—阿联酋建交经过
    袁鲁林
    今年十一月一日是我国和阿拉伯联合酋长国正式建交五周年。对相距万里之遥的中国人民和阿联酋人民来说，今年是大喜之年。
    一九八四年九月的一天，我驻阿曼使馆突然接到阿联酋使馆临时代办的电话，说他接到国内通知，邀请中国大使去阿布扎比面见拉希德外长，谈什么问题他不知道。我当时是驻阿曼苏丹国大使，曾多次访问过阿联酋首都阿布扎比和商业城市迪拜，会见过很多高级官员，但还没有见过拉希德外长。以往一谈到发展两国关系，对方官员都说先发展经贸和文化关系，两国建交只是时机问题，条件成熟时自然会建交。我们估计这次拉希德外长约见我，可能有两种考虑：一种是试探同我建立外交关系；一种是感谢中国在联合国安理会支持海湾六国提出的维护海湾自由通航的决议。
    当我应邀到阿布扎比外交部时，拉希德外长热情地迎接了我。他高兴地说，扎耶德·纳哈扬总统认为阿联酋和中国建交的时机已经成熟，总统赞赏中国尊重别国主权、独立和不干涉内政的对外政策。中国一贯呼吁阿拉伯人民团结，支持阿拉伯的正义事业；反对以色列当局的侵略，支持巴勒斯坦人民返回家园、重建国家的权利；支持海湾合作委员会六国提出的维护海湾自由通航的决议。这一切都赢得了阿拉伯人民、阿联酋人民的信任。
    经过两轮顺利的谈判，我和阿联酋外交部代理次长雅古布·肯迪于一九八四年十月二十五日签订了两国建立正式外交关系的协议，两国于十一月一日同时公布了建交的新闻公报，这是在海湾地区继科威特和阿曼之后第三个和我国正式建交的国家。
    在中、阿两国建交前，我国同阿联酋的经济贸易、文化往来就有了很大的发展。我国在阿布扎比和迪拜都举办过中国经济及商贸展览会，在迪拜还设立了中国贸易代表处。一九八零年，中国开辟了经沙迦到西欧的航线。中国建筑工程公司在阿布扎比开展了建筑承包业务。一九八三年，中国东方歌舞团应邀参加阿联酋国庆，进行了一周的访问演出，轰动了阿联酋。中国穆斯林代表团曾两次访问阿联酋，和阿联酋的穆斯林兄弟进行了亲切的会见。这一切往来和活动都促进了两国人民的相互了解和信任，为两国建交创造了条件。
    建交五年来，两国关系有了新的发展，各种经济、政治、贸易、文化往来十分频繁，为两国关系的发展打下了良好的基础。展望未来，我相信两国政治、经济和文化关系将有更大的发展，特别是在经济合作方面还有很大的潜力，等待着我们去开发。两国友谊之树将永远常青。
