A number of districts, units, and individuals who have made outstanding contributions to education were commended and rewarded at a recent education work conference. Li Ximing, Chen Xitong, and He Dongchang attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

Since last June, Beijing's primary and secondary schools have implemented reforms in internal labor, personnel, and distribution systems. By introducing a competitive mechanism, the enthusiasm of a wide range of educators has been stimulated. The principal responsibility system has been further implemented, and the treatment of key teachers has been significantly improved. At the same time, the rational flow of teachers has been promoted.
