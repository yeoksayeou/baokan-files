White House spokesman Fitzwater said on the 6th that President Bush rejected Soviet leader Gorbachev's proposal to reduce the naval forces of the superpowers during the Malta summit between the United States and the Soviet Union. Fitzwater said the aforementioned proposal was "unacceptable" because the United States is a naval power and relies on sea lanes to maintain contact with Western allies and other countries in the world.

Naval power is the lifeline of the Western alliance in the Atlantic, and it is also the only military domain that has not been touched in arms negotiations.

    布什拒绝戈氏削减海军建议
    白宫发言人菲茨沃特六日说，布什总统在马耳他美苏首脑会晤中拒绝了苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫提出的削减超级大国海军力量的建议。菲茨沃特说，上述建议是“不可接受的”，因为美国是海军大国，它依靠海上通道同西方盟友和世界其它国家保持联系。
    海上力量是西方联盟在大西洋的生命线，它也是武器谈判中唯一没有触动的军事领域。
