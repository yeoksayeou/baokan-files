Nearly nine thousand middle schools in our country have already established population education courses, and more than eight million middle school students have received population education. Population education is an important part of national conditions education. It helps students understand the relationship between population and social progress, and between population and nature. For an increasing number of only children, population education helps them develop a perspective that starts from the perspective of 1.1 billion people, fostering a spirit of considering the bigger picture and understanding the broader situation, which has profound significance.

Population education is also a necessary part of policy education. Controlling population growth and improving population quality are our fundamental policies. The implementation of these policies relies mainly on propaganda and education. Middle school population education is a crucial preliminary education. In Western Europe, the low population growth rate emerged on the basis of highly developed economies and cultures. In the decade after World War II, Japan, with its rapid economic development and increasing educational levels, also largely solved the problem of rapid population growth. Currently, 45% of women of childbearing age in China are illiterate, and out of four million out-of-school children, the majority are girls. Therefore, to smoothly implement population policies in China, we must strengthen education.

Population education is an essential part of quality education for adolescents and should be integrated throughout the six years of middle school. When conditions permit, it should also include the upper grades of primary school. Population education covers a rich array of content: junior middle school focuses on adolescent education; in the third year of junior middle school, six class hours are dedicated to population policy within the socialist construction course; in senior middle school, education on love, marriage, family, ethics, and eugenics is provided, while in geography, biology, and politics classes, education on population and nature, and population and society is conducted. Through six years of education, students not only develop physically and mentally in a healthy way during their school years but also, after entering society, can correctly handle unavoidable life issues, ensuring that their own growth and even the growth of the next generation follows the correct path.

    中学应修人口教育课
    我国已经有近九千所中学开设了人口教育课，八百多万中学生受到了人口教育。人口教育是重要的国情教育。要使学生懂得人口与社会进步，人口与大自然的关系。对于越来越多的独生子女，通过人口教育使他们建立一切从十一亿人口出发的观点，培养顾大局、识大体的精神，意义是极为深远的。
    人口教育也是必要的政策教育。控制人口数量，提高人口素质，是我们的基本国策，这一政策的贯彻，主要靠宣传与教育。中学人口教育则是重要的前期教育。西欧人口的低增长率产生在经济、文化高度发展的基础之上；日本战后在只有十多年的时间里随着经济发展和人民受教育程度的提高，也基本上解决了人口增长过快的问题。目前我国育龄妇女文盲占百分之四十五，四千万失学儿童多数是女孩。因此，在中国要顺利贯彻人口政策，唯有加强教育。
    人口教育是青少年不可缺少的素质教育，它应贯穿中学六年。在条件允许的时候，还应该包括小学高年级。人口教育包含丰富的内容：初中以青春期教育为主；初三的社会主义建设课中专门安排六课时的人口政策课；高中进行恋爱、婚姻、家庭、伦理、优生优育的教育，同时在地理、生物、政治课中进行人口与自然、人口与社会的教育。通过六年的教育，既使学生在校阶段身心健康地发展，又使学生进入社会后能正确处理生活道路上不可避免的问题，使自身、甚至下一代的成长能遵循正确的道路。
