Among the world's major religions, Buddhism stands out for its profound doctrines, intricate structure, and vast literature. It originated in the East, spread throughout the East, and is imbued with the wisdom of Eastern nations, making it a shared cultural treasure of Eastern countries. India, the birthplace of Buddhism, is home to countless treasures of early Buddhist art: Vedic literature that can be compared to the "Book of Songs" and the "Iliad," the enduring Gandhara sculptures, and the world-renowned treasure—the Ajanta cave murals. All of these have sparked the keen interest of scholars from India and other countries, who have diligently excavated, organized, and studied them. Today, there are countless works on Indian Buddhist art. Particularly notable is Japan's study of Buddhism, which has produced an internationally renowned Zen master, Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki. Suzuki's extensive knowledge of Eastern and Western history and philosophy, as well as his profound and intricate writing style, has guided subsequent Japanese scholars to systematically explore the relationship between Buddhism and culture from the Middle Ages to the modern era in Japan, as well as the Zen principles that permeate ancient art creation and social life.

The relationship between Buddhism and art has been a subject of close attention since the May Fourth Movement, particularly among scholars like Wang Guowei, Chen Yinke, and Zheng Zhenqiu. Despite the passage of time, their outstanding contributions remain unparalleled. Over the past few decades, Buddhist studies in Taiwan have never ceased, accumulating a significant body of research with both quantity and quality.

Given the need to organize traditional culture and the growing interest in Buddhism and its relationship with Chinese and Eastern art both domestically and internationally, the editors of "Buddhism and Eastern Art" (published by Jilin Education Press) have made every effort to gather existing research results from scholars both domestically and internationally. This collection, compiled from an ocean of literature, serves as a valuable reference for broad information gathering, intellectual inspiration, and rapid improvement of academic research standards in our country.

The collection is divided into four parts: The first part, "Buddhist Overview," focuses on introducing the origins of Buddhism, its doctrines, and the significant influence of the largest sect that emerged during its spread—Zen Buddhism—on Eastern art. The second part, "Buddhism and Indian Art," includes insightful discussions by scholars from China and abroad on early Buddhist literature and various forms of art. The third part, "Buddhism and Chinese Art," is the largest section, exploring the overall relationship between Buddhism and Chinese art. It also includes a significant portion on the multifaceted perspectives of Zen and poetry, making it a distinctive part. The fourth part, "Buddhism and Japanese Art," features renowned works by famous scholars and contemporary Zen masters, showcasing the unique fusion of Buddhism and Japanese art.

    评介《佛教与东方艺术》
    公孙许
    在世界各大宗教中，论教义的深邃，构架的精致，卷帙的浩繁，佛教当首屈一指。它发源于东方，流布于东方，充满了东方民族的智慧，为东方诸国共有的文化财富。印度是佛教的发源地，集中了初期佛教艺术的无数瑰宝：堪与《诗经》、《伊利亚特》相媲美的吠陀文学，传世的犍陀罗雕刻艺术，驰名世界的宝藏——阿旃陀石崖壁画……这一切无不唤起了印度及其他国家学者的浓厚兴趣，奋力从中发掘、整理、研究，如今关于印度佛教艺术的论著可谓汗牛充栋。最引人注目的还是日本对佛教的研究，那里产生了一名国际知名的禅学大师——铃木大拙，他博道东西文史哲学，写作风格深湛绵密。由于铃木先生的导引，后继的日本学者从宏观的把握到微观的审视，对本国中世纪至近代佛教与文化的关系史，以及普遍渗透于古代艺术创作乃至社会生活的禅机，无不作了系统的研讨。佛教与艺术的关系，早在五四运动前后就已引起王国维、陈寅恪、郑振铎等一批睿智学者的密切关注，他们不禅劳苦，潜心著述，逝去的漫长岁月并未掩没其超卓的贡献。几十年来，台湾的佛教研究从未间断，积累了一批数量和质量都较为可观的研究成果。
    有鉴于对传统文化的梳剔整理和海内外对于佛教与中国、东方艺术的日益浓烈的兴趣，《佛教与东方艺术》（吉林教育出版社出版）一书的编者尽可能多地汇集国内外学者已有的研究成果，在浩如烟海的文献材料中编选厘定的这部资料集。这对于广泛征集信息，启迪心智，尽速提高我国学术研究水平，实属难得的借鉴。
    全集含四辑：第一辑“佛教要览”，着力介绍了佛教的始源、教义及其在流布过程中产生的最大流派——禅宗的地位和对于东方艺术不可低估的影响。第二辑“佛教与印度艺术”，其中收录了中外学者对于最早的佛教文学直到各门类艺术的精辟论述。第三辑“佛教与中国艺术”，该辑容量最大，辑内所录，除了对佛教和中国艺术整体关系的探讨外，禅学与诗学的多面观照占有相当篇幅，是颇具特色的一辑。第四辑“佛教与日本艺术”，本辑内收有佛教与日本艺术关系的著名论者和当今世界著名禅学大师的传世之作，使人看到，佛与日本艺术的融会，是一种别具性格的境界。
