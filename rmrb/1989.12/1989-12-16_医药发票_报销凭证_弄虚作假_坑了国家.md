	Recently, in our insurance payment work, we have discovered that the issue of falsifying and issuing fake medical receipts is quite serious in our area. According to statistics from our company's personal insurance department, in 1988, 8,154 fake medical receipts were found, amounting to 51,162 yuan, which accounted for 36.2% of the total receipts submitted. In the first half of 1989, 5,317 fake medical receipts were found, amounting to 32,416 yuan, which accounted for 38.1% of the total receipts submitted.

	There are three main reasons for this chaotic situation:

	First, the health department has relaxed its management of medical receipts. There are no unified regulations for the printing and use of medical receipts, and each institution operates independently. County and township hospitals generally use single-copy, unnumbered receipts.

	Second, some hospitals have the wrong operational policies. In recent years, after the financial department implemented the lump-sum funding system for hospitals, some hospitals have completely changed from being service-oriented to profit-oriented. They only focus on making a profit and do not consider the social impact. As long as the "customer" comes back, they issue receipts at will.

	Third, some medical billing staff are irresponsible in their work. They do not properly manage blank medical receipts and billing stamps, leading to the theft and misuse of receipts. Some medical billing staff even assist relatives and friends in issuing fake receipts.

### 医药发票　报销凭证  弄虚作假　坑了国家

    医药发票　报销凭证
    弄虚作假　坑了国家
    湖南省邵阳县保险公司王君健来信：近年来，我们在保险给付工作中，发现我地乱开和开假医药发票的现象相当严重。据我司人身保险股统计，1988年查出假冒医药发票8154张，金额达51162元，占报来发票总数的36.2％；1989年1—6月查出假冒医药发票5317张，金额达32416元，占报来发票总数的38.1％。
    造成这种混乱现象的原因有三：一是卫生部门放松了对医药发票的管理，对医药发票的印制和使用没有统一规定，各自为政。区、乡医院普遍采用单联式不编号发票。二是一些医院的办院方针不对头。近年财政对医院经费包干后，一些医院便把事业型彻底改变为经营型，只讲营利，不顾社会效果，只要“顾客”下次来，发票随意开。三是一些医务收费人员工作不负责，不按规定保管医药空白发票和收费章，以致发票被人盗用。有的医务收费人员甚至协助亲友开具假发票。
