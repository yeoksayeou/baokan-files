Today, the first batch of cadres selected from Gansu Province left their office buildings and moved into rural homes to conduct a large-scale political and economic situation education campaign in the countryside.

Conducting political and economic situation education in rural areas, with a focus on patriotism, socialism, collectivism, hard work, and national and provincial conditions, is a major step taken by Gansu Province to implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. To ensure that this education campaign is effective and substantial, the Provincial Party Committee decided to send 10,000 cadres from provincial, municipal, and county-level offices to the countryside to assist with the work this winter and next spring.

When deploying this education campaign, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government required that each region start from the actual situation, address the most pressing issues for cadres and the masses, and conduct propaganda and education in a layered and targeted manner. The cadres who go down to the countryside will set their work base in rural areas and also eat and live there. They should strive to help the masses solve problems in production and life, do practical and beneficial things, avoid formalism, and not go through the motions. Through solid work, they will implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee to every township, village, and household in the province, laying a good ideological foundation for achieving a bumper harvest next year.

    把五中全会精神落实到乡镇村组农户
    甘肃万名机关干部下乡
    本报兰州12月16日电　记者张述圣报道：今天，甘肃省首批抽调的干部，走出机关大院，住进农家村舍，开展一场大规模的农村政治和经济形势教育。
    在全省农村开展以爱国主义、社会主义、集体主义、艰苦奋斗和国情、省情为主要内容的政治、经济形势教育，是甘肃省为贯彻落实党的十三届五中全会精神而采取的重大步骤。为了把这场教育搞得有声有色，扎扎实实，省委决定在今冬明春抽调万名省、地、县机关干部下乡帮助工作。
    甘肃省委、省政府在部署这场形势教育时，要求各地从实际情况出发，从干部群众最关心的问题入手，分层次、有针对性地开展宣传教育。下去的同志，工作基点放在农村，吃住也在农村。要尽力帮助群众解决生产、生活中的问题，办实事、办好事，不图形式，不走过场，通过扎扎实实的工作，把党的十三届五中全会精神落实到全省每个乡镇、每个村组、每个农户，为夺取明年农业丰收奠定良好思想基础。
