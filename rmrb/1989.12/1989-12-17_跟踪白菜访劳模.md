In late October, this reporter came to Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, for an interview, and was immediately captivated by the cabbages on the streets and alleys: those carts, piles, and rows of cabbages, with their emerald-green leaves and snow-white stalks, neatly uniform in size, each weighing around 5 kilograms, truly made one's mouth water!

Zhang Chuankai from the Jinzhou Daily introduced me to this: these are the high-quality varieties meticulously cultivated by national labor model Li Jiangang, named "Sunjiawan New No. 5." Currently, this variety is widely planted not only in Jinzhou City but also in Jinxi, Chaoyang, Dandong, Chengde, and Qinhuangdao. The characteristics of this cabbage are strong adaptability, drought and disease resistance, a refreshing taste, easy storage, and a yield of up to 10,000 kilograms per mu. The more we talked, the more excited we became, so we immediately drove to Sunjiawan in Taihe District, Xincun Township, to visit Li Jiangang.

Li Jiangang is 44 years old and is a farmer technician in the Sunjiawan Village Science and Technology Team. His 28 years of agricultural practice have yielded remarkable results in scientific farming. In March, he went to Japan with the city's science and technology inspection team; in September, he was named a national labor model and went to Beijing for a conference, where he was received by central leaders.

Li Jiangang told me that in 1961, he began studying the Soviet Union's Michurin grafting method, grafting winter melons, pumpkins, potatoes, and tomatoes, and then conducted distant hybridization experiments, but none of these yielded ideal seeds. He believed that to have good offspring, one must have good seeds. Once, the then-brigade leader Xu Fengzhang brought back two books, "Selection of Male Sterile Two-Use Lines" and "Self-Incompatible Lines," from a provincial meeting. Li Jiangang treasured them as if they were gems. He studied and practiced, and with the help of Shenyang Agricultural College and the district vegetable research institute, he collected 17 cabbage varieties and conducted 500 hybrid combinations. Through annual greenhouse breeding, by 1980, he had cultivated five high-quality cabbage varieties, including "Sunjiawan No. 1," with "Sunjiawan No. 5" being the best. Li Jiangang said that last year, his "Sunjiawan New No. 5" cabbages had the largest one reaching 65 centimeters high and 15 kilograms in weight, with a yield exceeding 20,000 kilograms per mu, winning the first place in the province.

Facing Li Jiangang, my heart could not calm down for a long time: what a humble farmer, what a precious spirit of research, what a respectable labor model! For the sake of a small, high-quality cabbage seed, he had silently and tirelessly struggled for more than a decade. May "Sunjiawan New No. 5" be spread across the gardens of the North China Plain.

    跟踪白菜访劳模
    本报记者　徐建中
    10月下旬，记者来到辽宁省锦州市采访，马上被大街小巷的大白菜吸引住了：那一车车、一堆堆、一排排白菜，翠绿翠绿的菜叶，雪白雪白的菜帮，整整齐齐的个头，每棵都在5公斤左右，真叫人“眼馋”！
    锦州日报的张传凯向我介绍：这是全国劳动模范李建刚精心培植出来的优良品种，叫“孙家湾新五号”，目前全锦州市，以及锦西、朝阳、丹东、承德、秦皇岛等地也大都栽植这个品种。这种白菜的特点是适应性强，抗旱抗病，适口清爽，便于贮存，每亩产量可达1万公斤。我们越谈越兴奋，便立即驱车来到太和区新民乡孙家湾访问李建刚。
    李建刚今年44岁，是孙家湾村科研队农民技术员。28年的农业劳动实践，使他在科学种田方面获得了可喜的成果。今年3月，他随市科技考察团到过日本；9月间被评为全国劳动模范到北京开会，受到中央领导同志的接见。
    李建刚告诉我，他1961年开始学习苏联米丘林的嫁接法，嫁接冬瓜、南瓜、土豆和西红柿等，接着又搞远缘杂交试验，但都没有获得理想的种子。他认为：种瓜种菜，有好种子才能有好后代。有一次，当时的大队长徐凤章从省开会带回《雄性不育两用系的选育》和《自交不亲和系》两本书。李建刚如获至宝，他边学习边实践，在沈阳农学院和区蔬菜科研所的帮助下，先后收集了17个大白菜品种，搞了500个杂交组合，通过年年温室加代，到1980年即培育出“孙家湾一号”等五个优质白菜品种，其中尤以“孙家湾五号”为最好。李建刚说，去年，他种植的“孙家湾新五号”大白菜，最大的一颗高65厘米，重15公斤，亩产超过2万公斤，获得全省第一名。
    面对着李建刚，我内心久久不能平静：多么朴实的农民，多么可贵的钻研精神，多么令人敬佩的劳动模范啊！为了小小的一粒优质大白菜种子，他默默无闻、辛辛苦苦奋斗了十几年。愿“孙家湾新五号”能撒遍华北平原的大小菜园。（附图片）
