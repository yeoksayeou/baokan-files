Xinhua News Agency, Manila, November 28th.

China's Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin said at the Asia-Pacific Chief Justices Conference held in Manila on November 28 that China will take measures such as increasing judicial strength, improving the legal enforcement level of judicial personnel, and adhering to the principle of combining evidence from both parties and court investigations to fundamentally solve the problem of delays in judicial work.

The third Asia-Pacific Chief Justices Conference, attended by representatives from 17 countries, was held in Manila from November 27 to December 1, focusing on how to address delays in judicial work.

Ren Jianxin said that various levels of courts in China have always attached great importance to improving the efficiency of various types of cases and have taken timely resolution of cases and reducing the burden of litigation on the parties as the guiding principles for judicial work. In practice, most of the cases accepted have been resolved within the legal review period. From January to August this year, 96.8% of criminal cases were resolved within the statutory review period.

To improve China's judicial work, Ren Jianxin said China is willing to conduct friendly exchanges with foreign courts to learn from their beneficial experiences that are applicable to China's national conditions.

Ren Jianxin also announced at the meeting that the 14th World Law Congress, organized by the "Center for the Rule of Law for World Peace," will be held in Beijing from April 22 to 27 next year, and welcomed legal professionals from the Asia-Pacific region to attend.

On November 29, Ren Jianxin met with the host country's Philippine Justice Minister Sedfrey Ordoñez. The two sides exchanged views on judicial work between the two countries. Ordoñez said he would visit China next April to directly interact with Chinese judicial workers and attend the 14th World Law Congress. At the end of the meeting, he presented his poetry collection "Exploring Peace" to Ren Jianxin as a memento.

    我代表在亚太地区首席大法官会议上指出
    中国将采取措施提高审判效率
    新华社马尼拉电　中国最高人民法院院长任建新11月28日在马尼拉召开的亚太地区首席大法官会议上发表讲话时说，中国将通过增加审判力量，提高审判人员的执法水平，坚持当事人举证和法院调查相结合的原则等措施，从根本上解决审判工作中的拖延问题。
    有17个国家的代表出席的亚太地区首席大法官第三次会议于11月27日至12月1日在马尼拉举行，主要讨论如何解决审判工作中的拖延问题。
    任建新说，中国的各级法院一直很重视提高各类案件的审判效率，并把及时审结案件减轻当事人的诉讼负担作为审判工作的指导原则。在实践中，对所受理的多数案件都做到了在法律规定的审理期限内及时审结。今年1月至8月，96.8％的刑事案件能在法定审理期内审结。
    为了改进中国的审判工作，任建新表示中国愿意同外国法院进行友好交流，以借鉴他们适用于中国国情的有益经验。
    任建新在会上还宣布说，由“通过法律维护世界和平中心”主办的第14届世界法律大会定于明年4月22日至27日在北京举行，欢迎亚太地区法律界朋友们届时与会。
    任建新11月29日会见了东道国菲律宾司法部长塞德弗雷·奥多涅斯，双方就两国司法工作交换了意见。奥多涅斯表示他明年4月将访问中国、直接与中国司法工作者接触，并出席第14届世界法律大会。会见结束时，他将他的诗集《探索和平》赠于任建新留念。
