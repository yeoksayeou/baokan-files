On the 23rd, Endara appointed First Vice President Calderon as the Minister of the Interior and Justice, and Second Vice President Ford as the Minister of Planning. Julio Linares was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that out of the country's 9 provinces, 8 have already appointed new governors.

    恩达拉在今年5月7日的大选中是公民反对派联盟总统候选人。这次大选结果后来被当局宣布作废。但恩达拉则声称赢得了大选。恩达拉是20日美军入侵巴拿马之后就任总统的。23日，恩达拉任命第一副总统卡尔德隆兼任内政和司法部长，第二副总统福特兼任计划部长，胡利奥·利纳雷斯任外交部长。据悉，全国9个省中已有8个省有了新省长。
