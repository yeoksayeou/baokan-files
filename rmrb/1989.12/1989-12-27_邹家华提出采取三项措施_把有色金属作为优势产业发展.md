Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Gu Honghong and Liu Xiaoyang report from Beijing, December 25th:

All regions and departments should, in accordance with the central government's requirements, highly value and genuinely support the development of the non-ferrous metals industry. This was proposed by State Councilor Zhou Jiahua at the national non-ferrous metals industry work conference held today.

Currently, the main problem in the non-ferrous metals industry is that the development of alumina, the primary raw material for electrolytic aluminum, lags far behind the development of electrolytic aluminum. Addressing this issue, Zhou Jiahua said that we must pay great attention to and accelerate the development of alumina production. To this end, the main measures to be taken are:

First, in accordance with the state's industrial policy, we should tilt towards alumina, accelerate the construction of alumina plants under construction, and ensure that they start production as soon as possible;

Second, we should accelerate the internal potential and transformation of enterprises, rely on technological progress, and strive to increase alumina production;

Third, we must protect aluminum ore resources, stop reckless mining, and pay attention to the construction of aluminum mines. All levels of government should protect the normal production and construction of state-owned mines, and create a good external environment for alumina production.

Regarding the long-term imbalance and irrationality of the mining, smelting, and processing production capacities in the non-ferrous metals industry, Zhou Jiahua emphasized that the focus of the rectification and reorganization of the non-ferrous metals industry should be on adjusting the production structure, enterprise structure, and improving economic benefits, and solving the problem of the "mining, selection, smelting, and processing" inverted pyramid.

    邹家华提出采取三项措施
    把有色金属作为优势产业发展
    本报北京12月25日讯　新华社记者顾洪洪、本报记者刘燮阳报道：各地区和各部门都应当按照中央的要求高度重视和切实支持有色金属工业的发展。这是国务委员邹家华在今天召开的全国有色金属工业工作会议上提出来的。
    当前，有色金属工业存在的主要问题是：作为电解铝主要原料的氧化铝发展速度远远落后于电解铝的发展速度。针对这一问题，邹家华说，要十分重视和加快发展氧化铝生产。为此，应采取的主要措施：
    一是根据国家产业政策，向氧化铝方面倾斜，加速在建氧化铝厂的建设，使其尽快投产；
    二是加速企业内部挖潜改造，依靠科技进步，努力增加氧化铝生产；
    三是要保护铝矿资源，制止乱采滥挖，重视铝矿山建设，各级政府应保护国营矿山正常生产建设，为氧化铝生产创造好的外部环境。
    针对有色金属工业的采矿、冶炼、加工生产能力长期处于不平衡不合理的状态，邹家华强调，有色金属工业治理整顿的重点，应当放在调整生产结构、企业结构和提高经济效益上，着重解决“采、选、冶、加”倒宝塔形问题。
