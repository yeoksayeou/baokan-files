Rural Areas Should Implement a System of Compulsory Commercialization of Labor

After the implementation of the household responsibility system in rural areas, the construction of farmland water conservancy projects and other works mainly rely on farmers to contribute compulsory labor. However, according to our investigation, some places have seen issues such as unequal distribution of compulsory labor and lack of effort when working, which have affected the smooth progress of farmland basic construction. It is suggested that relevant departments establish a system of compulsory commercialization of labor in rural areas. Villages should, based on the amount of compulsory labor each labor force should contribute and a unified labor value standard, collect the compulsory labor funds in monetary form and then return them to the labor force that contributes compulsory labor in the form of labor remuneration. This way, the goal of managing compulsory labor through economic means can be achieved.

    农村应实行义务工商品化制度
    农村实行生产责任制后，修建农田水利等工作主要依靠农民出义务工来完成，但据我们调查，一些地方出现义务工分配不均、出工不出力等问题，影响了农田基本建设的顺利进行。建议有关部门在乡村建立义务工商品化制度，乡村按照每个劳动力应出义务工的数量和统一工值标准，以货币的形式，把义务工款统筹起来，再以劳动报酬的形式返还给出义务工的劳力，从而达到利用经济手段管理义务工的目的。
