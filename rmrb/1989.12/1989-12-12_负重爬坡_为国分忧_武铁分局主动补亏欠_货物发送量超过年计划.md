Employees of the Wuhan Railway Bureau have demonstrated a sense of ownership, shared national worries, and actively made up for the losses caused by the turmoil. By the end of November, the bureau had completed converted turnover volume, cargo shipment volume, and transportation income, all of which had significant growth compared to the same period last year. Comprehensive economic indicators ranked first among the six bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau.

The turmoil that occurred this spring and summer caused a significant shortfall in the Wuhan Railway Bureau's production tasks for the first half of the year, with a deficit of over 400 million ton-kilometers in transportation converted turnover volume. The 70,000 employees of the entire bureau demonstrated the spirit of a locomotive, shouldering burdens to climb hills, and took practical actions to share national worries. To increase the volume of cargo shipments, they changed the past habit of waiting for customers to come to them. The deputy bureau chief in charge of transportation led the team to enter factories and mines to organize cargo sources and used every possible means to provide high-quality services to cargo owners. Since July, the volume of cargo shipments has exceeded the target every month. So far, the bureau's cargo shipment volume has not only made up for the deficit but has also exceeded the annual plan by more than 300,000 tons.

    负重爬坡　为国分忧
    武铁分局主动补亏欠
    货物发送量超过年计划
    本报武汉12月11日电　武汉铁路分局职工发扬主人翁精神，为国分忧，积极主动补回动乱造成的亏欠。到11月底止，完成换算周转量、货物发运量、运输进款收入，都比去年同期有较大增长。综合经济指标在郑州铁路局所属6个分局中名列第一。
    今年春夏之交发生的动乱，给武汉铁路分局上半年生产任务带来大幅度亏欠，仅运输换算周转量就亏欠4亿多吨公里。全分局7万职工发扬火车头精神，负重爬坡，用实际行动为国分忧。为了增加货物发送量，他们一改过去等客上门的习惯，由主管运输的副局长带队，深入工厂矿山组织货源，千方百计为货主提供优质服务。7月份以来，货物发送量月月超产。到目前为止，这个局货物发送量不仅补回亏欠，还超年计划30多万吨。
