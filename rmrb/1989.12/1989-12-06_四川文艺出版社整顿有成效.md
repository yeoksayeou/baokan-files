    Sichuan Literature and Art Publishing House, which was penalized last year for publishing books with obscene content, has made significant improvements after undergoing rectification and study. The editorial staff has corrected their publishing mindset, revised their project selection plans, and prioritized the publication of books with high social benefits. They have strictly enforced publishing disciplines, strengthened the three-level review process, and refused to collaborate on book publications, effectively blocking the path for the publication of inferior books. Several good books have been published. The youth literature series "Torch Series" released by the publishing house this year has healthy and wholesome content, is easy to understand, and has been well-received by middle and elementary school students. The first batch of seven titles, totaling 30,000 copies, has already sold out.

    四川文艺出版社整顿有成效
    本报讯　记者袁晞报道：去年因出版有黄色内容书籍受到处分的四川文艺出版社，经过整顿和学习，出版社编辑人员端正了出版思想，重新制定了选题计划，优先出版社会效益好的书，并严格执行出版纪律，加强三审制，拒绝协作出书，堵住了坏书出版的路。出版了不少好书。这个出版社今年推出的青少年读物《火炬丛书》思想内容健康，通俗易懂，受到中小学生的喜爱，第一辑七种三万套已脱销。
