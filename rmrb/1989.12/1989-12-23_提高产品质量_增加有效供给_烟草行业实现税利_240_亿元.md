    The tobacco industry in China has fully leveraged the advantages of tobacco monopolies, focusing on strengthening centralized management and macroeconomic regulation. It is expected that the industry will achieve a total tax revenue of 2.4 billion yuan for the year, an increase of 14% compared to last year.

    Since the beginning of this year, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration and the China National Tobacco Corporation have tapped into internal potential, vigorously adjusted the product structure, improved product quality, and increased effective supply.
