The exact number of libraries in the world is impossible to determine. Even the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) cannot provide an approximate figure. It is estimated that the annual expenditure of major public and semi-public libraries worldwide ranges from $15 billion to $20 billion, with Western European countries and the United States each spending around $5 billion.

The annual budget for purchasing books, newspapers, and magazines by millions of libraries is approximately $4 billion to $5 billion. If private libraries' book purchases are included, the figure would at least double.

So far, there is no internationally accepted standard for determining the size of a library. Some fundamental issues remain unresolved, such as whether the number of books in a library should be counted by the number of volumes or titles. If a book with the same title is divided into multiple volumes, how should it be counted? What is the specific distinction between books and pamphlets? If periodicals are counted as books, should each article in a periodical also be considered a unit of measurement? However, some world-renowned libraries are widely recognized by people around the world for their extensive collections and well-equipped facilities.

Recently, UNESCO listed eight of the world's top libraries in a report. They are:

1. The Lenin State Library in Moscow, with a collection of 30 million volumes (including periodicals and series);
2. The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., with a collection of 22 million volumes;
3. The British Library in London, with a collection of 15 million volumes;
4. The Leningrad Library, with a collection of 12 million volumes;
5. The Harvard University Library in the United States, with a collection of 11 million volumes;
6. The National Library of France in Paris, with a collection of 11 million volumes (part of the collection will be moved to the French Library, scheduled to be completed in 1995);
7. The National Diet Library in Tokyo, with a collection of 8 million volumes;
8. The Library of Alexandria in Egypt, with a collection of 4 million volumes, renowned for its holdings on the history of the Mediterranean region and the Arab nations.

    世界八大图书馆
    全世界究竟有多少图书馆？这是无法回答的问题。甚至连国际图书馆协会与学社联盟（IFLA）也不能举出一个大致的数字，只能估计全球各国较大的公立和半公立图书馆每年所耗的经费总数为150亿至200亿美元之间，其中西欧各国和美国的图书馆各占50亿美元。
    千千万万个图书馆每年用于购买书报杂志的款额约为40亿至50亿美元。如果将私人图书馆的购书款计算在内，数字就至少要增加1倍。
    迄今为止还没有一个国际通用的标准来确定图书馆规模之大小。因为，有些原则问题无法解决，例如：某图书馆的藏书数量是以册数还是以书名计算？如果一个名称的书分为若干卷怎么办？书籍和小册子的具体区别是什么？期刊如果作为书籍计算，那么期刊中的每篇文章是否也应成为计算单位？不过，有些举世闻名的图书馆在藏书数量和设备完善等方面是长期被各国人民公认的。
    最近，联合国教科文组织在一份报告中列出了8个世界第一流图书馆。它们是：
    1、莫斯科的国立列宁图书馆，藏书3000万册（包括期刊和丛书）；2、华盛顿的美国国会图书馆，藏书2200万册；3、伦敦的大英图书馆，藏书1500万册；4、列宁格勒图书馆，藏书1200万册；5、美国哈佛大学图书馆，藏书1100万册；6、巴黎的法国国立图书馆，藏书1100万册（一部分图书将转移到预计1995年建成的法国图书馆）；7、东京的日本国会图书馆，藏书800万册；8、埃及的亚历山大图书馆，藏书400万册，所藏关于地中海区域及阿拉伯民族史籍为世界之冠。
