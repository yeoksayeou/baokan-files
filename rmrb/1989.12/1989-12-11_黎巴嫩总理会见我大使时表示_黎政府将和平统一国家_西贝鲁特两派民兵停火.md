Lebanese Prime Minister Hussein Hussein today met with Chinese Ambassador to Lebanon Yang Yi-huai at his residence. Hussein stated that the Lebanese government will spare no effort to achieve national unity through peaceful means.

Hussein said that due to the opposition of Lebanese Christian leader Michel Aoun to the Taif Agreement, which aims to achieve national reconciliation, and Aoun's attempt to use part of his military force to threaten national unity, Lebanon is facing a serious danger of division.

He expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for its continuous support for Lebanon's cause.

Additionally, Prime Minister Hussein condemned Israel's infringement on Lebanon's sovereignty. He said that the Lebanese government has instructed its representative to the United Nations to consult with representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council to draft a resolution condemning Israel's aggression.

	BEIRUT, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- Syrian troops stationed in West Beirut opened fire on the warring Shiite Muslim Amal Movement and Hezbollah militias on Dec. 8, forcing both sides to cease fire.

	According to security officials, 10 people were killed and 20 injured in the street battles that erupted between the Amal Movement and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah on Dec. 7. Two more militiamen were killed by Syrian troops.

	The fighting subsided in the afternoon, and residents of West Beirut began to emerge from their underground shelters.
