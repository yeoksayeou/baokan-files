	United efforts to overcome disasters and achieve a bumper harvest
	Sichuan's grain production exceeds 40 billion kilograms

	Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 18th: Reporter Luomaocheng reports: The first province in China by population, Sichuan, has overcome various natural disasters this year and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture. The total grain production reached 40.685 billion kilograms, an increase of 1.9 billion kilograms over last year, nearly reaching the historical high of 1984. Cotton, flue-cured tobacco, silkworm cocoons, and citrus fruits all saw significant increases. The number of pigs slaughtered will reach 57 million.

	At the beginning of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government clearly proposed the important measures and goals of "stabilizing the area, increasing yield per unit area, expanding double cropping, focusing on dryland crops, relying on science and technology, and ensuring a 10% increase over last year while striving for a 15% increase." To ensure the realization of this year's goals, the province launched a large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction project last winter and this spring. A total of 8.09 million people were mobilized, contributing 130 million man-days of labor. Over 1.2 million acres of low-yielding fields were transformed, and more than 7 million acres of irrigation areas were restored and improved, laying a solid foundation for this year's agricultural bumper harvest.

	The province's scientific and technical personnel undertook more than 1,800 large and medium-sized scientific and technological projects, including formula fertilization, comprehensive pest control, and high-yield standardized cultivation of crops, covering an area of over 50 million acres. Preliminary statistics show that these projects have increased grain production by more than 1.15 billion kilograms and increased income by more than 2.8 billion yuan, setting a record for the best results from these undertakings.
