The Chinese Kunqu Opera Troupe, composed of the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe, the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater, the Jiangsu Provincial Kunqu Opera Troupe, the Jiangsu Provincial Su Kunqu Opera Troupe, the Zhejiang Provincial Kunqu Opera Troupe, and the Hunan Provincial Kunqu Opera Troupe, was invited by the Hong Kong Urban Council to participate in the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre's "International Performing Arts Festival." The performance received high praise from Hong Kong audiences, as well as audiences from Taiwan and abroad.

The "International Performing Arts Festival" organized by the Hong Kong Urban Council was a major cultural event in Hong Kong this year. The invited performing arts groups were mostly renowned internationally, including the British National Theatre, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Berlin Wind Ensemble, and world-famous performers such as Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma. Among these, the Chinese Kunqu Opera Troupe stood out and received widespread acclaim from the audience. This was, in essence, an international test of Chinese Kunqu Opera. As a professor from Taiwan remarked, "Chinese Kunqu Opera is comparable to Italian opera and is a world-class art form."

However, before the performance, we were concerned about whether the Hong Kong audience would accept Kunqu Opera. Hong Kong residents themselves admitted that they were not familiar with or knowledgeable about Kunqu Opera. Before the troupe's departure, news came that ticket sales for "The Peony Pavilion" were at 50%, while other performances were at 30% or even lower. This news put considerable psychological pressure on us.

Facing this situation, Mr. Yu Zhenfei and several leading actors arrived in Hong Kong early to introduce the history and characteristics of Kunqu Opera to Hong Kong friends and held several "Kunqu Opera Lectures." These activities had some effect. By the time of the first performance, the audience attendance had reached 60-70%.

That evening, the opening performance was "The Border Checkpoint," starring the young male martial arts actor Lin Weilin from the Zhejiang Kunqu Opera Troupe. Lin Weilin's elegant movements, fiery martial arts, and high-difficulty actions immediately captivated the audience. Following this was "Sending the Child Away" performed by Ji Zhenhua and Shi Xiaomei. Their performance was heart-wrenching, bringing tears to the eyes of many audience members. "The Capture" was a signature piece by Liu Yilong and Liang Guyin, who performed it vividly, making the atmosphere in the theater particularly lively. The finale was "Sending the Bride to the Capital," performed by Hou Shaokui and Hong Xuefei. The rough and powerful style of the Northern Kunqu Opera, combined with their exquisite performance, allowed the audience to experience the charm of Northern Kunqu Opera, which is different from Southern Kunqu Opera. After the performance, the audience erupted in enthusiastic applause that lasted for a long time. The actors repeatedly took their bows.

The first performance was a resounding success. The news spread quickly. The Hong Kong "Chinese Overseas Daily" wrote: "The Southern and Northern Kunqu Opera performances in Hong Kong were brilliant, with both martial and civil performances receiving thunderous applause." From then on, the audience increased significantly. By the 17th performance of "The Peony Pavilion," the audience was packed. This performance featured famous actors from various troupes. The four "Du Liniang" roles were played by Zhang Jiqing and Hu Jinfang from Jiangsu, Zhang Xuanpeng from Shanghai, and Wang Fang from Suzhou, each with their unique style. The three "Liu Mengmei" roles were played by Cai Zhengren and Yue Meiti from Shanghai, and Wang Shiyu from Zhejiang, each with their distinctive characteristics. The entire performance can be said to have reached a state of transcendent artistry.

The last two performances, "The Mountain of Blossoms" and "The Chivalrous Knight," reached new heights. In "The Mountain of Blossoms," Liang Guyin and Zhang Jiqing portrayed two distinct "Cui Shis." The former was spirited and delicate, while the latter portrayed a complex and multifaceted character. The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" praised their performance art as having "reached the pinnacle of perfection" and "gained great acclaim." In "The Chivalrous Knight," Zhang Jiedie played Wang Dalang, with a stunning performance that drew much attention and was praised as a "magical dwarf."

This time, the martial arts performances also achieved unprecedented success, with the audience being particularly enthusiastic. Wang Ziquan's "The Tower of Elegance" and "Stealing the Silver" showcased beautiful body movements and extraordinary fighting scenes, shocking the Hong Kong audience. In summary, all the actors performed in perfect harmony, each bringing out their best.

Kunqu Opera conquered the Hong Kong audience, and the audience fell in love with Kunqu Opera and its performers. They expressed their feelings with applause and flowers. After each performance, the entire backstage corridor was filled with flower baskets sent by the audience.

A group of audience members from Taiwan who came specifically to watch the performance also gave high praise. As we were about to leave Hong Kong, many Taiwanese compatriots visited the troupe late at night to offer congratulations. They said that this performance went beyond its original significance. It would have a profound impact on promoting the new national art of our country and raising public awareness of Kunqu Opera.

    昆剧在香港
    ——记中国昆剧艺术团赴港演出
    方杰
    由上海昆剧团、北方昆剧院、江苏省昆剧院、江苏省苏昆剧团、浙江省昆剧团、湖南省昆剧团所组成的中国昆剧艺术团，应香港市政局邀请，前不久参加了香港市政局举办的香港文化中心开幕献礼“国际演艺菁华”演出，受到香港观众以及台湾、国外观众的高度赞扬。
    香港市政局举办的“国际演艺菁华”，是今年香港文化生活中一大盛事。被邀请参加演出的，大多是国际上享有盛誉的艺术表演团体，除中国昆剧艺术团外，还有英国国家剧团、丹麦皇家芭蕾舞团、美国波士顿交响乐团、维也纳柏林木管合奏团，以及艾锡·史顿、马友友等世界著名演奏家等。我国昆剧团面对如此众多的强手，独树一帜，而又获得广大观众的交口称誉，实际上这是对我国昆剧的一次国际性的检验。正如台湾一位教授所说，“中国昆剧堪同意大利歌剧媲美，都是世界第一流的艺术。”
  然而在此之前，我们对香港观众能否接受昆剧，甚有担心。香港人自己说，他们对昆剧不熟悉，不了解。在昆剧团即将赴港前，传来信息，预订票除《牡丹亭》有五成外，余皆或三成，或二成多。这个信息对我们的心理压力是可想而知的。
    面临这种情况，俞振飞老先生率几位主要演员，先期抵港，向香港朋友介绍了昆剧的历史及特点，并连续举办了几次“昆剧讲座”。这些活动取得一定效果。到首场演出时，观众上座已达到六七成。
    这天晚上，开锣戏是《界牌关》，由浙昆青年武生演员林为林主演。林为林以其漂亮的身段，火爆的武打，高难度动作，一下抓住了观众。接下来便是计镇华、石小梅的《寄子》。二人的表演凄楚动人，使不少观众流下眼泪。《活捉》是刘异龙和梁谷音的拿手戏，他们演得活灵活现，剧场气氛尤其活跃。压轴的是侯少奎、洪雪飞的《送京娘》，北昆的粗犷风格，和他们精到的表演，使观众领略到有别于南昆的北方昆曲的魅力。剧终之后，观众中爆发出热烈的掌声，经久不息。演员连连谢幕。
    首演一炮打响。消息不胫而走。香港《华侨日报》写道：“南北昆汇香江演出精彩，文武戏满堂掌声”。自此观众激增。到17日演出《牡丹亭》，观众爆满。该剧汇集了各团的名角儿。江苏的张继青、胡锦芳，上海的张洵澎，苏州的王芳四位“杜丽娘”，和上海的蔡正仁、岳美缇，浙江的汪世瑜三位“柳梦梅”，各具特色。整个表演可以说达到了出神入化的境界。
    最后两场演出，《烂柯山》和《义侠记》，又达到了新的高潮。《烂柯山》中，梁谷音、张继青塑造了两个迥然不同的“崔氏”。前者泼辣细腻，后者则演出了一个复杂多面的性格。香港《文汇报》称赞她们的表演艺术“达到了登峰造极的地步”，“获誉甚隆”。《义侠记》中，张寄蝶扮武大郎，表演精彩，引人注目，被誉为“神奇的矮人”。
    这次武戏的演出，也获得空前的成功，观众最为热烈。王芝泉的《雅观楼》和《盗库银》，以优美的形体动作，和不同凡响的大打出手，震撼了香港观众。总之，所有演员配合默契，都发挥了自己的最佳水平。
    昆剧征服了香港观众，观众爱上了昆剧，更爱上了昆剧演员。他们用掌声和鲜花表达了自己的这种感情。每场演出整个后台走廊布满了观众送来的花篮。
    一批从台湾专程来看戏的观众，对演出也给予很高的评价。当我们即将离开香港时，许多台湾同胞深夜来团探访，表示祝贺。他们说，你们这次演出实际上超出了演出本身的意义。它对张扬祖国民族新艺术，提高大众对昆剧的认识，将产生深远的影响。
