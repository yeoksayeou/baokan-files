	Recently, we conducted a survey in Anhui's Chuzhou region and Jiangsu's Huaiyin City, and found several issues of general concern in rural areas that need urgent resolution.

	Farmers Fear Policy Changes

	During our survey in Xiaogang Village, Fengyang County, one of the earliest adopters of the household contract responsibility system, we found that farmers universally worry about policy changes. A woman expressed her concerns passionately: “Since summer, my heart has been pounding with worry, fearing that after just a few good years, we might revert back to the old days.” Village head Yan Junchang said: “Farmers are all worried about a return to the old collective system, especially since we were the first to implement the household contract responsibility system. Lately, many people from neighboring villages have come to ask if we are going back to the old collective system.” The fear of policy changes in Xiaogang is rooted in history. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Xiaogang was infamous for its poverty, with households begging for food. In 1979, 18 households in Xiaogang took a risk and implemented the household contract responsibility system. Over the past decade, this system has proven highly effective, increasing grain production from over 20,000 kilograms in 1978 to over 200,000 kilograms in 1988 (with 100,000 kilograms contributed to the state), and raising per capita annual net income from 22 yuan to over 600 yuan. The contrast between past hardship and present prosperity has convinced Fengyang's farmers of the benefits of the household contract responsibility system; however, the deep scars of past poverty have left them with a special fear of the old system and a heightened sensitivity to any policy changes.

	Private Entrepreneurs and Individual Households in Rural Areas Face Increased Concerns

	Recently, extensive media coverage of illegal activities by individual households and private enterprises has sparked significant reactions among rural private entrepreneurs and individual households. They feel that while county leaders once praised them as pioneers in developing rural commodity economies, they are now being criticized for “exploitative relationships.” This has created a heavy psychological burden for them.

	Fengyang County's Huangwan Township is known for its reed production, and locals have a tradition of weaving reed mats. However, due to poor sales channels, the resource advantage could not be converted into a commercial advantage. After 1980, farmer Chen Xinghan started a reed mat distribution business, covering several neighboring counties. Chen Xinghan's home township of Huangwan, along with the adjacent Huiji Township, became specialized weaving townships. Incomplete statistics show that in 1985, these two townships saw per capita income increase by over 100 yuan from reed weaving alone. Chen Xinghan also became wealthy. After accumulating wealth, he did not forget the collective, investing large sums in rural public welfare projects and supporting struggling farmers. Starting in 1988, Chen Xinghan invested in and hired workers to develop over 1,000 mu of flooded land, producing over 100,000 kilograms of grain in the first year. It is estimated that next year, he will produce 600,000 kilograms of grain. Recently, Chen laid off his workers. A young man from the poverty-stricken Lu'an region, who had worked for Chen for three years, living and eating with Chen's children, had saved over 3,000 yuan, and cried when he was laid off. Chen Xinghan expressed his confusion about current policies and media reports, saying: “While there are indeed some backward and illegal individuals among private entrepreneurs, not all are like that. If I were to seek enjoyment and only care for myself, I would not engage in agricultural development; I would simply deposit my money in the bank and live off the interest. I come from a poor family, and seeing the country's grain shortage and the poverty of surrounding farmers, I always want to help everyone become wealthy. But now, if you do, you have no peace of mind; if you don't, you feel reluctant.”

	In Jiangsu's Siyang County, the Jiu Long Wine Factory's manager, Chen Tongyin, after becoming wealthy, built two roads over 5 kilometers long for the village and continuously took over the village's welfare projects for two years. He said: “I am now worried about two things: policy changes and the envy of the masses. The key is the policy. As long as the policy does not change, the masses will not cause trouble. So now, I keep an eye on the policy and hold onto my wallet; if the policy changes, I will scale down; if it doesn't, I will expand.”

	Some Grassroots Cadres Are in a Dilemma

	Over the past decade, including Fengyang County, the Chuzhou region has adhered to the principle of starting from reality, stabilizing and improving the household contract responsibility system, mobilizing and protecting farmers' production enthusiasm, and vigorously carrying out agricultural basic construction and improving the socialized service system for agriculture. This has led to annual increases in grain production and steady improvements in farmers' incomes, with coordinated development of agriculture and industry. Now, higher authorities are calling for the development of rural collective economies, and county and township cadres want to align with the central government but do not know how to do so. Some cadres, under the guise of strengthening the collective economy, have taken measures that have caused farmers' unease and dissatisfaction. The main officials of the prefecture and county who accompanied us on the survey also paid great attention to these problems. In addition to re-examining and handling relevant issues, they believed it was necessary to vigorously publicize the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session regarding the stability of rural basic policies, to dispel farmers' doubts, and to make farmers truly at ease. We had in-depth discussions with prefecture, county, district, and township cadres, and they all feared that the central government's policies on rural areas might revert to the “leftist” direction of the past, but their actual actions often reflected this bias, assuming it to be in line with the central government. This contradiction between thought and action is a reflection of the aftereffects of past political movements and is worth noting.

	Our Suggestions

	1. To address farmers' fear of change, winter idle time should be used to strengthen the propaganda, explanation, and education of rural policies, to stabilize the rural areas, and to promote production.

	2. The positive role of individual households and private enterprises engaged in development production in rural areas in promoting rural commodity economies, increasing rural employment, and leading farmers to prosperity should be affirmed, and their continued development should be encouraged. It must be recognized that the vast majority of them, after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, took advantage of the Party's policy of “letting some people get rich first” and, through legal operations and honest labor, became wealthy first. After becoming wealthy, they do not only seek personal enjoyment but are more spirited, treating their economic activities as a cause, with a strong sense of social responsibility. Therefore, these people should be respected and cared for by local masses and party and government cadres. Moreover, supporting one rural development-oriented individual household or private enterprise is equivalent to supporting a large number of farmers; destroying one is equivalent to discouraging a large number of farmers. A favorable public opinion environment should be created for the development of rural development-oriented individual households and private enterprises. Of course, they should also be actively guided and managed.

	3. The specific connotations, principles, and methods of developing the collective economy should be clarified; otherwise, it may lead to a return to the old system. The behavior of some grassroots cadres, under the guise of developing the collective economy, infringing upon farmers' interests should be stopped. It should be continued to clarify that various forms of the household contract responsibility system with household management as the mainstay are part of the collective economy, to stabilize the minds of the people.

	4. After farmers complete the state procurement and contract purchase tasks, the grain market should be opened as soon as possible. The tendency of departmental interests expanding and harming the overall situation should be stopped; otherwise, it may repeat the mistake of 1985, suppressing the farmers' production enthusiasm that has been difficult to arouse again.

### 稳定农村基本政策是群众的愿望——苏皖部分地区农村调查报告

    稳定农村基本政策是群众的愿望
    ——苏皖部分地区农村调查报告
    余国耀　黄守宏
    不久前，我们到安徽滁县地区和江苏淮阴市调查，发现农村有几个带有普遍性的问题亟待解决。
    农民存在怕“变”心理
    我们在最早搞大包干的安徽凤阳县小岗村调查时发现，农民普遍担心政策变。一位妇女很激动地说：“打夏天来心里就一直打鼓，怕刚过了几年好日子再退回去”。村主任严俊昌说：“农民都担心再搞过去那一套，因为我们是最早搞大包干的，最近周围村里很多人都到我们这里来打听，是不是又要归大堆了”。小岗农民怕政策变是有历史原因的。十一届三中全会以前，小岗户户要饭，是远近闻名的要饭村。1979年，小岗18户农民冒着风险搞起了大包干。10年来大包干责任制发挥了巨大的威力，小岗粮食产量由1978年的2万多公斤增加到1988年的20多万公斤（向国家贡献10万公斤），人均年纯收入由22元增加到600多元。历史与现实的对比使凤阳的农民认准了大包干这条道；但过去贫穷的生活给他们留下的痛苦太深了，以至于他们对旧体制抱有特殊的恐惧心理，对政策的细微变化特别敏感。
    农村私营企业主、个体户忧心增多
    最近报纸、广播中大量宣传个体户、私营企业的各种违法行为，在农村私营企业主和个体户中，引起了较大的反响，他们说，前两年县委书记、县长亲自给戴大红花，说他们是发展农村商品经济的带头人，现在却宣传“私营企业存在剥剥关系”，他们感到精神压力很大。
    凤阳县黄湾乡盛产芦苇，群众有编芦苇席的传统，但由于销售渠道不畅，资源优势不能转变为商品优势。1980年后农民陈兴汉办起苇席运销业，收购范围涉及到邻近的几个县。陈兴汉所在的黄湾乡及邻近的惠基乡成了编织专业乡。据不完全统计，1985年这两个乡仅苇编一项人均增收百元以上。陈兴汉也富了起来。他富裕后不忘集体，拿出大量资金用于农村公益事业，支持有困难的农民。从1988年开始，陈兴汉投资、雇工开发1000多亩水淹地，当年即产粮10多万公斤。预计明年可收粮食60万公斤。最近陈辞退了雇工。一个来自六安地区（贫困地区）的青年，在陈家干了3年，与陈家小孩同吃同住，已存了3000多元钱，被辞退时哭哭啼啼不愿走。陈兴汉对目前的一些政策和报纸宣传表示不理解，他说：“个体户、私营企业中确有思想落后违法的，但不是都这样。我如果贪图享受，光顾自己的话，我就不搞农业开发了，干脆把钱存入银行中吃利息算了。我是穷苦人家出身，看到国家粮食不够，周围的农民也不富裕，总想把大家搞富，但现在这种情况，你干吧，心里没底，不干吧，又不甘心”。
    江苏泗阳洋河九龙酒厂厂长陈同银致富后为村里修了两条长5公里多的路，还连续两年把村里福利事业包下来。他说：“我现在怕两头，一怕政策变，二怕群众红眼病，关键是政策，只要政策不变，群众就不会起哄。所以我现在两只眼看政策，两只手捂口袋，政策不变就扩大规模，要变就收缩”。
    一些基层干部左右为难
    十年来，包括凤阳县在内的滁县地区坚持从实际出发，稳定并完善以大包干为主的联产承包责任制，调动并保护农民的生产积极性，加上大力进行农田基本建设，完善农业的社会化服务体系，使粮食产量年年增长，农民收入稳步提高，工农业协调发展。现在，上级号召发展农村集体经济，县、乡干部想与中央保持一致但又不知怎样才算保持一致。一些干部在加强集体经济的名义下，采取了一些措施，引起了农民的不安和不满。陪同我们一起调查的地、县主要负责同志也都十分重视这些问题，除了对有关问题重新作必要的研究和处理，还认为，很有必要大力宣传五中全会关于农村基本政策不变的精神，解除农民的疑虑，使农民真正放心。我们同地、县、区、乡干部深入交谈，他们都怕中央关于农村的政策向过去“左”的方向复归、倾斜，但是，实际的行动往往又作出了这样倾斜的反应，以为这是与中央保持一致。这种思想与行动的矛盾现象，是过去政治运动的后遗症的反映，值得重视。
    我们的建议
    1．针对农民怕变的心理，利用冬闲时间大力加强农村政策的宣传、解释、教育，以安定民心，稳定农村，促进生产。
    2．应肯定农村从事开发性生产的个体户和私营企业在促进农村商品经济发展，增加农村就业，带动农民致富方面的积极作用，鼓励其继续发展。必须看到，他们绝大多数是在党的十一届三中全会后随着农村改革和经济的发展，在党的“让一部分人先富起来”政策鼓励下，靠合法经营和诚实劳动先富起来的。他们自己富起来后，并不只顾自己享受，而是更加振奋精神，把自己从事经济活动当作一项事业看待，有着很高的社会责任感，因此，这些人应当受到当地群众和党政干部的尊重和关怀。而且，扶持一个农村从事于农业开发的专业户、个体户和私营企业就等于扶持了一大批农民；弄垮一个就等于打击了一大片农民。应创造一个有利于农村从事开发性生产的个体户、私营企业发展的舆论环境。当然对他们也应积极引导，加强管理。
    3．应明确发展集体经济的具体涵义、原则和方法，不然很可能导致旧体制的复归。应制止一些基层干部借发展集体经济的名义，侵犯农民利益的行为，应继续明确以家庭经营为主的各种联产承包责任制属于集体经济的一个组成部分，以安定民心。
    4．在农民完成国家定购任务和议购后，应尽快开放粮食市场。要制止部门利益膨胀危害全局的倾向，不然很可能又会重蹈1985年的覆辙，把好不容易才鼓起来的农民生产积极性重新打下去。
