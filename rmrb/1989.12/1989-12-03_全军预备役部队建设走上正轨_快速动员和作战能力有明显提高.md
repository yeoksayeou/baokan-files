The construction of the reserve forces in the PLA has entered the right track and presented a new face.

The reserve forces are a product of the recent military reform. Since the establishment of the first reserve division in the PLA seven years ago, it has entered the right track. The reserve forces have been included in the organizational sequence of the PLA, with relatively complete organizations and reasonable layouts; the basic construction of the forces has taken shape, with good office, training, and living conditions; various rules and regulations are constantly being improved, and the regularization construction of division and regiment headquarters has been strengthened; the education and training of the forces have become regularized, and the rapid mobilization capability and the capability to immediately execute combat missions have been improved. The reporter saw in many reserve divisions and regiments that the reserve forces, which were empty-handed a few years ago, now have training bases, complete teaching facilities, and well-equipped professional teaching and research rooms, electronic teaching equipment, professional equipment, and simulation equipment. Each unit carries out training and assessments according to the unified training outline, exploring successful experiences in strengthening the construction of reserve forces.

In the process of regularization construction, all reserve forces in the PLA attach great importance to establishing and improving the implementation of various rules and regulations, actively creating conditions to complete training tasks, and emphasizing the training of cadres, professional technical training, basic training, and the training of combat-ready companies. The rapid mobilization capability and combat capability of the forces have been significantly improved.

With the continuous improvement of the military and political qualities of the reserve forces, they have played an important role in the construction of material and spiritual civilization. In recent years, the reserve forces have participated in various emergency, difficult, dangerous, and heavy tasks such as flood control and rescue, earthquake relief, urban public welfare projects, and agricultural land construction in various regions, becoming a shock force. The reserve forces in the PLA have also actively carried out poverty alleviation and relief, learning from Lei Feng to do good deeds, maintaining social order, and combating criminal activities. In the suppression of turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots across the country this year, the reserve forces cooperated with the troops and public security to protect factories and roads, playing an important role.

    全军预备役部队建设走上正轨
    快速动员和作战能力有明显提高
    新华社北京12月2日电  （记者杨民青）全军预备役部队建设已经走上正轨，展现出一派新的面貌。
    预备役部队是近年来军事工作改革的一项产物。从7年前组建全军第一支预备役师至今，已走上正轨。预备役部队被列入人民解放军建制序列，组织比较健全，布局基本合理；部队基本建设初具规模，有了较好的办公、训练和生活条件；各项规章制度不断完善，师团机关正规化建设得到加强；部队教育训练走上正规化，快速动员能力和立即执行作战任务的能力有了提高。记者在许多预备役师团看到，几年前还是两手空空的预备役部队，如今有了一个个训练基地，具备完善的教学设施，设有齐全的专业教研室、电化教学器材、专业器材、模拟器材。各部队按统一训练大纲实施训练、考核，摸索出加强预备役部队建设的成功经验。
    全军各预备役部队在正规化建设中，十分重视建立健全执行各项规章制度，积极创造条件完成训练任务，并突出干部训练、专业技术训练、基础训练和成建制战斗连队训练，部队的快速动员能力和作战能力有了明显提高。
    随着预备役部队军政素质的不断提高，在物质文明与精神文明建设中发挥了重要作用。几年来，预备役部队成建制地参加各地区的抗洪抢险、抗震救灾、城市公益工程建设、农田基本建设等急难险重任务，成为一支突击力量。全军预备役部队还大力开展扶贫救困、学雷锋做好事活动，积极参加维护社会治安，打击刑事犯罪。在今年全国各地制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱中，预备役部队配合部队、公安护厂护路，起了重要作用。
