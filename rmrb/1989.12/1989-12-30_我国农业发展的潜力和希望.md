I, along with several doctoral students, spent nearly half a year surveying China's agriculture. What we saw and heard was quite enlightening. Amidst the discussions about the "agricultural predicament," we saw new hope.

**Tons of Grain per Acre Fields Emerging**

Producing one ton of grain per acre (using the traditional measure of an acre, which is larger than the standard acre) has already appeared in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces.

In 1988, Hunan Province had 4.1 million acres of high-yield fields, with two crops of hybrid rice or an additional crop of barley per year, averaging 1,027 kilograms per acre. It is practical and in line with the national and provincial conditions to strive to develop high-yield fields (planning to reach 20 million acres by the year 2000).

Shandong Province promoted 1.5 million acres of high-yield fields this year. In late September, we saw in Pingyuan County that the plan for 500,000 acres of high-yield fields had been completed ahead of schedule. The Yaozhan Township in the county had 17,000 acres of high-yield fields, with an average yield of 401 kilograms of wheat and 651 kilograms of corn, totaling 1,052 kilograms per acre. The emergence of such extensive high-yield fields and excellent corn in the north is truly heartening. Jilin Province, located outside the Great Wall, has 2.7 million acres of single-crop corn fields, with an average yield of 555 kilograms per acre. The county produced 1.6 billion kilograms of grain in 1988, with an average of 1,700 kilograms of grain per person. Although it is not a high-yield field, achieving such a level in a temperate zone without irrigation is also quite remarkable.

**The Rise of "Vertical Farming"**

What is commonly referred to as "vertical farming" is actually a method of achieving layered, vertical, and continuous utilization of land and water resources through interplanting, mixed cropping, and other multi-crop methods.

Sichuan Province has only 0.9 acres of arable land per capita, and there are more hills than plains. They utilize every inch of land and every day of sunlight through "vertical planting." The province's Wusheng County has only 0.7 acres of arable land per capita, but it still contributes 0.85 pigs, 50 kilograms of grain, 5 kilograms of silkworm cocoons, and 11 kilograms of oranges per capita to the state. The method is: in paddy fields, after two crops of wheat and rice, another crop of regenerated rice or vegetables and feed is added. Winter paddy fields are used for rice-duck-fish mixed cropping, and dry slopes are used for wheat-corn-sweet potato three-crop rotation, with an additional one or two crops of vegetables in recent years. Additionally, citrus is developed on non-arable hills, and mulberry and beans are planted on the ridges. It can be said that "every field is green, and every season is green."

**The Development of Courtyard Agriculture**

This is the most intensive part of agriculture. It concentrates manpower, material resources, and technological advantages in small plots of land around residential areas for fine cultivation.

According to surveys in some counties in Sichuan, each household has about one-tenth of an acre of courtyard land, densely planted with vegetables, grapes, fruits, mushrooms, and raising chickens, ducks, pigs, and fish, with an income of four to five hundred yuan.

The various new models we have seen with our own eyes reflect the direction of China's agricultural development, with the following common characteristics:

First, high land-intensive type: The fundamental contradiction in China's agriculture is that per capita arable land is scarce and decreasing. The various methods mentioned above are all focused on the word "intensive," striving to increase yields, turning low-yield fields into medium-yield fields, and medium-yield fields into high-yield fields, and greatly improving land utilization and productivity.

Second, high energy flow type: To obtain more agricultural and livestock products on a unit of land, it is necessary to increase energy input (including materials, funds, labor, etc.), increase output, and improve energy flow frequency and economic benefits. Many "high-yield fields," "vertical farms," and "high-yield functional farms" not only increase the net income per acre but also have a considerable number of farms (about 2/3 of the surveyed areas) where the input-output ratio has not decreased. The reason is that these farms generally have good agricultural and water conditions. On this basis, mainly relying on the matching of advanced science and technology, the potential of the original land has been tapped.

Third, sustainable type: Many high-yield fields and high-yield farms are developed on the basis of good ecological and agricultural environments and have the characteristics of sustainable and stable production. Liling, one of the high-yield counties in the country, had an average yield of 187 kilograms per acre in 1949, which increased to 940 kilograms in 1988. The soil organic matter content was 1.5% in the late 1950s and rose to over 3% in the 1980s.

From the rise of various forms of intensive agriculture in recent years, we see the potential for China's agriculture to reach a new level. Although per capita resources are limited, the foundation is weak, and there are many difficulties, Chinese agriculture still has hope, and overly pessimistic national conditions analysis is not advisable. If we implement intensive agriculture on the existing 70 million acres of irrigated farmland and 200-300 million acres of semi-humid farmland, developing various forms of high-yield fields, thousand-kilogram fields, high-yield farms, and vertical farms, with an average annual yield of 500-750 kilograms per acre, then achieving 500 billion kilograms of grain is quite feasible.

### 我国农业发展的潜力和希望

    我国农业发展的潜力和希望
    北京农业大学教授　刘巽浩
    我带着几位博士生花了近半年的时间考察我国的农业。耳闻目睹，收获甚丰。在众人讨论的“农业困境”中又看到了新的希望。
    吨粮田成片涌现
    一亩地年产一吨粮（按习惯亩，比标准亩大）已在湖南、湖北、四川、山东、河北等地出现。
    湖南省1988年已有吨粮田410万亩，一年中种植两季杂交稻或者再加一季大麦，平均每亩产1027公斤。扎扎实实地努力发展吨粮田（计划到2000年达到2000万亩）是符合国情省情的。
    山东省今年推广吨粮田150万亩，9月下旬，我们在该省平原县看到5万亩吨粮田计划已提前完成。该县腰站乡1.7万亩吨粮田，上茬小麦平均401公斤，下茬玉米651公斤，全年亩产1052公斤。在北方出现这么成片的吨粮田，这么好的玉米，实在令人高兴。地处关外的吉林省公主岭，270万亩一年一作玉米，平均亩产555公斤，该县1988年产粮16亿公斤，人均占有粮1700公斤，虽不是吨粮田，但在无灌溉中温带达到这样的水平，也是很不容易的。
    “立体农业”兴起
    通称的“立体农业”，实际是通过间混套等多熟方式达到分层立体延续利用土地水面等资源的作法。
    四川省人均耕地只0.9亩，而且平原少丘陵多，他们就是通过“立体种植”见缝插针地利用每一寸土地和每一天的光阴。该省的武胜县人均耕地只0.7亩，但仍向国家贡献人均0.85头肥猪，50公斤粮食，5公斤蚕茧，11公斤柑桔。其办法就是：水田在麦稻两熟基础上再挤入一茬再生稻或蔬菜、饲料，冬水田搞稻萍鱼混作，旱坡地搞小麦玉米红薯三茬套种，近年又加一两茬蔬菜，另外在丘陵非耕地上发展柑桔，田埂上种桑豆。真可谓“有田皆绿，四季常青”。
    庭院农业发展
    这是农业中最集约的部分。在住宅周围集中人力物力技术优势在小片土地上精耕细作。
    据四川有些县调查，每户约拥有1分多地庭院，密集种植蔬菜、葡萄、瓜果、蘑菇、饲养鸡鸭猪鱼等，收入可达四五百元。
    我们亲眼所见的新出现的种种模式，反映了中国农业发展的趋向，其共同特点有：
    第一、高土地集约型：人均耕地少而且日益减少，这是我国农业的根本性矛盾。以上种种作法都是在“集约”两字上狠下功夫，努力提高单产，变低产为中产，中产为高产，大力提高土地利用率与生产率。
    第二、高能流型：为了在单位土地上取得更多的农牧产品，势必要走增加能量投入（包括物质、资金、劳动等），增加产出、提高能流频率与经济效益的路子。许多“吨粮田”、“立体农田”“高效益功能农田”等，不但亩纯收益增加，而且有相当数量的农田（约占考察的2／3以上）投入报酬并未递减。其原因是，这些农田一般已具备较好的农田环境与水利条件，在此基础上，主要靠先进科学技术的配套，挖掘了原有的潜力。
    第三，持久型：许多吨粮田、高效农田都是在良好的生态环境与农业环境基础上不断发展起来的，具有持久稳产增产的特点。全国高产县之一的湖南醴陵，1949年每亩耕地年单产187公斤，1988年达940公斤，50年代末土壤有机质为1.5％，80年代上升到3％以上。
    从近些年我国各地精久农业的兴起，我们看到了我国农业上新台阶的潜力。尽管人均资源少、底子薄、困难大，但中国农业还是有希望的，过分悲观的国情分析是不足取的。如果，我们在已有的7亿亩灌溉农田与2—3亿亩半湿润农区旱地上实行精久农业，发展多种形式的吨粮田、千斤田、高效益农田、立体农田等，平均年亩产以500—750公斤计，那么粮食上5000亿公斤就较为可行。
