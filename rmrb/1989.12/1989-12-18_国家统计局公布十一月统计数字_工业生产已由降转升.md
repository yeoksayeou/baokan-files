	The National Bureau of Statistics released the November statistics figures today, indicating that China's economy has made new progress in the process of rectification and adjustment. Industrial production has shifted from decline to growth, exports have rapidly increased, social demand continues to be controlled, and the rate of price increases has further decreased. The Bureau stated that the national economy is continuing to improve.

	According to the report, in November, industrial production reversed the negative growth of the previous two months and showed signs of recovery. The total industrial output value of the country increased by 0.9% compared to the same period last year. The number of regions with declining production decreased from 13 last month to 7. Major light industrial and textile products, as well as basic industrial products, maintained a growth trend. The total energy production, steel, steel products, and 10 types of non-ferrous metals increased by 6.6% to 22.4%, which created favorable conditions for industrial production in the first quarter of next year. The foreign trade situation has also improved significantly. In November, the value of goods exported through customs increased by 20.6%, which is a rare occurrence this year. Meanwhile, imports decreased by 12.6% compared to the same month last year. The cumulative total import and export value for the first 11 months reached $98 billion, and it is estimated that the full-year total will once again exceed $100 billion.

	At the same time, social demand has been further controlled. In November, the investment in fixed assets by state-owned enterprises was reduced by nearly 14%, and the purchase of consumer goods by social groups was the same as the same period last year. With the easing of the total supply and demand contradiction in society, the rate of price increases in the market has continued to decrease. In November, the price level in 35 large and medium-sized cities increased by only 5.9% compared to the same month last year. National residents' savings and enterprise deposits both increased by over 10 billion yuan compared to the previous month, providing more available funds for economic development.

	The statistics show that the prominent contradiction in the current social and economic life is that the trend of declining market sales has not changed. In November, the total retail sales of social commodities decreased by 0.9% compared to the same month last year, and the number of regions with declining sales increased. Some industrial and commercial enterprises have poor economic benefits, and the contradiction of financial revenue and expenditure imbalance has further expanded.

    本报北京12月17日讯　11月份我国经济在治理整顿中又有新进展，工业生产由降转升，出口迅速增长，社会需求继续得到控制，物价涨幅进一步回落。国家统计局称，国民经济发展继续趋向好转。
    据介绍，11月份工业生产改变了前两月负增长的局面，重现增长势头。全国工业总产值比去年同期上升0.9％，生产下降的地区由上月的13个减少为7个。主要轻纺产品和基础工业产品保持增长趋势，能源生产总量、钢、钢材、10种有色金属增长6.6％至22.4％，这为明年一季度工业生产创造了有利条件。对外贸易形势也有较大改观，11月份海关出口货物以20.6％的速度增长，这是今年来少有的。而进口则比去年同月下降12.6％。1至11月份累计进出口总额达980亿美元，估计全年将再度突破1000亿美元。
    同时，社会需求得到进一步控制。11月份，全民所有制固定资产投资额又压缩近14％，社会集团消费品购买额与去年同期持平。随着社会总供需矛盾的有所缓解，市场物价涨幅不断回落。11月份，35个大中城市物价水平比去年同月仅上涨5.9％，全国居民储蓄和企业存款均比上月增加100多亿元，为经济发展提供了更多的可使用资金。
    统计数字显示，当前社会经济生活的突出矛盾市场销售下降趋势并未改变。11月份，社会商品零售总额比去年同月下降0.9％，下降的地区又有增加。有些工商企业经济效益较差，国家财政收支不平衡矛盾进一步扩大。
