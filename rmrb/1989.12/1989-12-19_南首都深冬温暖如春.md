Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, December 16th.

Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, has been basking in sunshine and spring-like warmth over the past few days, with temperatures reaching a high of 21 degrees Celsius, the highest December temperature in 40 years. According to weather forecasts, this pleasant weather is expected to continue for another two to three days.

Mid-December is typically the coldest time of the year in Belgrade. However, instead of bundling up in winter coats and boots, people here have been strolling the streets in spring attire. Elderly residents are enjoying the sun in the parks.

Just a few days ago, the thermometer dropped to minus 6 degrees Celsius, and children were eagerly preparing their sleds and skates. But the weather seemed to play a trick on them, skipping winter and bringing an early spring.

The article is a factual report on the unusually warm weather in Belgrade during the winter of 1989. The tone is neutral and informative, reflecting the style of a typical news report from that era.

    南首都深冬温暖如春
    新华社贝尔格莱德12月16日电　（记者夏士华）南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德近几天来阳光明媚，温暖如春，最高气温达21摄氏度，创40年来12月份气温最高纪录。据气象预报，这样的天气还要持续两三天。
    12月中旬按时令贝尔格莱德本应是寒冷的冬天。可是，现在这里的人们把已穿上身多日的冬大衣和皮靴搁置一边，身着春装在街道上漫步，老人们高兴地在公园里晒太阳。
    本月上旬气温表上的水银柱曾一度降到零下6度，孩子们已准备好雪橇和冰鞋，结果天气好像和孩子们开个玩笑，把冬天跳过，让春天提前来到。
