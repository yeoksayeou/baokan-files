Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22nd. People's Daily reporter He Jiasheng and Xinhua News Agency reporter Pu Libin report: Vice Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang said today in a discussion with Beijing journalists that some places are currently facing difficulties in selling agricultural products due to issues such as poor circulation channels and a lack of procurement funds. He hopes that local authorities will quickly take measures to purchase the agricultural products that farmers have worked hard to produce, thereby protecting their enthusiasm for production.

It is understood that the difficulties in selling agricultural products in some places have led to a general decline in market prices for agricultural products. In Guangdong, rice prices have dropped from 80 yuan per dan during the Spring Festival to 42-43 yuan per dan. In Anhui, due to a lack of procurement funds, the province has issued 35 million yuan in IOUs for grain procurement. In Henan, due to a lack of funds, most places have been unable to procure priced grain, and the situation is at a standstill.

Chen Yaobang said that in recent periods, some departments and local governments have taken a series of measures to alleviate the problem of a lack of procurement funds for agricultural products, but the problem of difficulties in selling agricultural products has not been fundamentally solved. Therefore, he has four hopes for local authorities:

First, he hopes that all levels of government and relevant departments will pay high attention to the current post-production issues, understand the urgent needs of farmers, and think about what farmers need. They should genuinely care about agriculture and prioritize it in their actions.

Second, he hopes that financial institutions will further increase loans for procurement funds to avoid issuing IOUs to farmers.

Third, he hopes that procurement departments will fulfill their responsibilities, especially the main channels, which should play a greater role in actively procuring agricultural products.

Fourth, he hopes to further smooth out the circulation links and eliminate regional blockades.

    陈耀邦要求各地采取措施
    尽快将农副产品收购上来  切实保护农民生产积极性
    本报北京12月22日讯　新华社记者蒲立业、本报记者何加正报道：农业部副部长陈耀邦今天在同首都新闻记者座谈时说，当前一些地方因流通渠道不畅、收购资金紧缺等原因，重新出现农副产品卖难问题，他希望各地要尽快采取措施，将农民辛辛苦苦生产的农副产品收购起来，切实保护他们的生产积极性。
    据了解，一些地方的农产品卖难问题，已导致农产品的市场价格普遍下降。广东稻谷已由春节前后的每担80元，降到每担42至43元。安徽反映，由于收购资金紧缺，全省粮食收购已打“白条”3500万元。河南省也因资金紧缺，议价粮大多数地方没办法收，处于停顿状态。
    陈耀邦说，最近一个阶段，一些部门和地方政府采取了一系列措施，使农产品收购资金紧缺问题有所缓解，但农产品卖难问题并没有从根本上得到解决。为此，他向各地提出四点希望：
    第一，希望各级政府及有关部门对当前的产后问题应予以高度重视，急农民所急，想农民所想，把关心农业、重视农业切实落实在行动上。
    第二，希望银行金融部门能进一步增加收购资金的贷款，避免向农民打“白条”。
    第三，希望收购部门尽责尽力，特别是主渠道，要进一步发挥作用，积极收购。
    第四，希望进一步疏导流通环节，取消地区封锁。
