NATO Holds Meeting of Defense Ministers

People's Daily, Brussels, November 29th - Reporter Wei Wei reports: From November 28th to 29th, the NATO Defense Planning Committee held a ministerial-level meeting in Brussels. The defense ministers of NATO member countries primarily discussed NATO's defense plans and current strategies.

A statement released by the meeting emphasized, "Given the actual existence of the military potential of the Warsaw Pact, it is particularly important that we continue to emphasize the need for defense." The statement said that maintaining an "effective" defense is also beneficial for the current changes in the East.

The Chairman of the NATO Defense Planning Committee, Ed, said at a press conference held at noon on the 28th that in the future, NATO will continue to implement a "deterrence strategy" and "reliable defense."

According to the meeting agenda, the attendees reviewed the execution of this year's defense plans and approved the defense plans for the period 1990-1994. The meeting also discussed how to "reasonably share roles, risks, and responsibilities" within NATO. This internal dispute, which had temporarily subsided due to changes in the European situation, may now become intense and sharp again due to the rapid changes in East-West relations.

    北约举行国防部长会议
    本报布鲁塞尔11月29日电  记者魏崴报道：11月28日至29日，北约防务计划委员会在布鲁塞尔召开部长级会议。参加会议的北约成员国国防部长主要讨论了北约防务计划和当前的战略。
    会议发表的一项公报强调，“鉴于华约军事潜力实际存在，我们继续重视防务的需要是特别重要的”。公报说，保持“有效”的防务还有利于东方“目前发生的演变”。
    北约防务计划委员会主席艾德在28日中午举行的新闻发布会上说，今后，北约仍实行“威慑战略”和“可信赖的防务”。
    按照会议日程，与会者回顾了本年度防务计划的执行情况，并通过了1990—1994年期间的防务计划。会议还讨论了如何在北约内部“合理分担作用、风险和责任”问题。这个因欧洲局势变化暂时淡化了的内部争执，现在可能又因为东西方关系急剧变化而再度激烈、尖锐起来。
