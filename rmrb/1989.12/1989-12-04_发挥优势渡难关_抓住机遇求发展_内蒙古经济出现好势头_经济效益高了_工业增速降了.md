Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 3rd. - "In Inner Mongolia's economic life, difficulties and opportunities coexist." Recently, at a meeting to implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenum, Wang Qun, Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, pointed out: The various difficulties facing the national economy are also reflected to varying degrees in Inner Mongolia. However, it also faces opportunities. Seizing these opportunities means seizing the favorable conditions to overcome difficulties.

It is reported that Inner Mongolia has two main favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties: First, the region has a large agricultural production potential and advantages in energy, transportation, and raw material industries; second, it is adjacent to the Soviet Union and Mongolia, with geographical and land port advantages.

Throughout this year, the entire region has seized the opportunity and used these favorable conditions to continuously overcome difficulties, resulting in a positive trend of "one high and four lows" in economic development.

"The 'one high' is high economic efficiency. In the first nine months of this year, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises increased by 6.3%, the revenue from the sale of products by budgeted industrial enterprises increased by 15.3%, and the total tax revenue increased by 16.7%, surpassing the national average for the first time. This ensured that local fiscal revenue increased by more than 15.9%. More encouragingly, foreign trade and economic and technological cooperation are thriving. In 1985, the total import and export value of border trade with the Soviet Union and Mongolia was only 39.08 million Swiss francs, which rose to 140 million Swiss francs last year. In the first eight months of this year, the total value of barter trade contracts signed with the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Eastern European countries reached 380 million Swiss francs."

"The 'four lows' are: First, through macro-control, the growth rate of industry has decreased; second, the scale of fixed asset investment has been reduced to a low level, with 44 out of 119 ongoing projects being closed, stopped, merged, or transformed, reducing the investment scale by 231 million yuan; third, the momentum of overheated consumption demand has started to decrease, with the savings balance in the first nine months of this year increasing by 26% compared to the same period last year; fourth, the price increase trend has been controlled, with the retail price increase rate dropping from 21.9% in the first half of the year to 11.5% in September."

Facing the positive trend in the region's economic development, Wang Qun urged all levels of party and government cadres to maintain a clear mind, neither to be pessimistic nor to be blindly optimistic. They should continue to seize opportunities in the face of difficulties, leverage their advantages, and ensure that the region's economy continues to develop steadily and harmoniously during the rectification and adjustment period.

    发挥优势渡难关　抓住机遇求发展
    内蒙古经济出现好势头
    经济效益高了　工业增速降了
    本报呼和浩特12月3日电  记者傲腾报道：“内蒙古经济生活中困难与机遇同在”。自治区党委书记王群最近在全区贯彻落实五中全会精神会议上指出：全国经济形势面临的各种困难，在内蒙古都有不同程度的反映，但同样面临着机遇，抓住了机遇也就抓住了克服困难的有利条件。
    据介绍，内蒙古克服困难的有利条件主要有两个：一是全区农业生产潜力大，并拥有能源、交通、原材料工业等产业优势；二是毗邻苏、蒙，有着地理位置和陆地口岸的优势。
    今年以来，全区上下不失时机地抓住机遇，运用有利条件不断克服困难，使经济发展出现了“一高四低”的好势头。
    “一高”是经济效益高。今年头9个月，全民独立核算工业企业全员劳动生产率提高6.3％，预算内工业企业产品销售收入增长15.3％，利税总额增长16.7％，第一次超过了全国的平均水平，从而保证了地方财政收入增长15.9％以上。更加喜人的是对外贸易和经济技术合作蓬勃发展，1985年全区与苏、蒙边境贸易进出口额只有3908万瑞士法郎，去年上升到1.4亿瑞士法郎，今年头8个月全区与苏、蒙和东欧国家签订易货贸易合同额已达3.8亿瑞士法郎。
    “四低”，一是经过宏观控制，工业增长速度已降低；二是固定资产投资规模压缩到低水平，在建的119个项目中，有44个项目关、停、并、转，压缩投资规模2.31亿元；三是消费需求过热的势头开始降低，今年头9个月全区储蓄存额比去年同期增长26％；四是物价涨势得到控制，进入9月份，零售物价涨幅从上半年的21.9％降低到11.5％。
    面对全区经济发展的良好势头，王群要求各级党政干部保持清醒头脑，既不能悲观失望，也不能盲目乐观，要继续在困难中不失时机地把握机遇，发挥优势，以确保全区经济在治理整顿中持续、稳定、协调发展。
