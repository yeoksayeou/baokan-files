Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th.

Recently, at the invitation of Peking University's Student Union and Graduate Student Union, the spokesperson for the State Council, Yuan Mu, the deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Jia Luo, and the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yuan Li Ben, visited Peking University to exchange views with some students on the current domestic and international situations and to answer questions of interest to the students.

In a lively atmosphere, Yuan Mu first delivered an impromptu speech lasting about an hour.

Yuan Mu said, "I am not here today as the government spokesperson, but as a friend of the students, to exchange views with you on some matters. I will first talk about my reflections on the situation in China after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. During the turmoil and rebellion, China indeed faced the danger of being overthrown. At that time, many comrades within and outside the Party were worried and sleepless. After the suppression, in the past six months or so, the overall situation is that the country is stable, policies are stable, people's hearts are stable, and social order has quickly returned to normal. Of course, there are still some unavoidable factors of instability. But the overall situation shows that China, led by the Communist Party of China with a population of 1.1 billion, is still advancing on the socialist road. Our country is still presenting itself to the world's people with a vigorous and upward posture of reform and opening up. I think the development of the situation in the past six months has shown the following points:

First, the vast majority of the Chinese people support the Communist Party and love socialism. Without the support of more and more people, the situation in our country could not have been stabilized.

Second, our Party is a Party that can withstand tests. In the face of such a great storm and such a heart-wrenching struggle, the Party did not lose its principles. After the suppression, our Party has been deeply reflecting and striving to improve its work from reflection. It is with a serious Marxist attitude that we correct our mistakes. Our Party is a Party that has been tested by long-term struggles and has a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses, not a Party that collapses with a single blow.

Third, our army is a people's army that is loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to socialist China. Although for a period of time, quite a few people did not fully understand the army's execution of the Party and government's orders to decisively suppress the rebellion, as the facts became clear, more and more people support the measures taken by the Party and government. It can be said that after the test of blood and fire, the unity between the military and the people has been further strengthened.

Fourth, the new central leadership elected at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is gradually gaining the support and trust of more and more people through their actual actions. They are striving to fully implement the Party's basic line, adhere to reform and opening up, and when making major decisions, they walk the mass line and extensively solicit the opinions of Party members and non-Party personnel, strengthening their connection with the masses.

Fifth, we have gained initial experience in stabilizing the situation. I think the most important thing is: (1) To persist in the unity of the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, to both adhere to reform and opening up and to adhere to the socialist direction of reform and opening up, so that the two are unified in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. (2) Led by cadres at all levels, to do practical work and not just talk, to strive to solve some problems that the people urgently want to solve, such as combating corruption, strengthening clean governance, improving Party style, and stabilizing economic development. (3) To maintain the stability and continuity of the Party's basic policies. Many reform and opening-up measures need to be gradually enriched and improved on the basis of policy stability and continuity. Policy stability means people's hearts are stable.

Yuan Mu then spoke to the students about China's economic situation. He said, "The facts have proven that in the 10 years of reform and opening up, China's economic construction has achieved tremendous results. During these 10 years, China's gross national product has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 10%, increasing by 1.51 times. Compared with the situation in various countries around the world during the same period, China's economic growth rate is among the highest in the world. We should fully affirm the achievements of the 10 years of reform and opening up, and at the same time, realistically assess the economic difficulties we face. The current difficulties are not just a problem of the past one or two years; they started to appear in the second half of 1984 with issues such as economic overheating and have gradually accumulated. Therefore, a relatively long period of rectification and adjustment is needed. The rectification and adjustment of the past year have already shown initial results, mainly in the following aspects: (1) Initial results have been achieved in controlling the total amount, and the dual expansion of investment demand and consumption demand has been curbed. (2) This year's agricultural situation is relatively good, with the national grain production expected to reach or slightly exceed the historical high of 1984. (3) The scale of credit and currency issuance has been controlled relatively well, with significant increases in urban and rural residents' savings and improvements in the financial situation. (4) The rate of price increases this year is slightly lower than last year, with fewer new factors causing price increases, and the upward trend is decreasing month by month, gradually easing the public's anxiety about price increases. However, new problems such as sluggish market sales, tight enterprise funds, and increased unemployment have emerged during the rectification and adjustment process. We cannot be shaken by the emergence of new contradictions in our confidence and determination to carry out rectification and adjustment, nor can we be complacent. We must strive to study new situations and solve new problems. We must mobilize and organize enterprises to adjust their product structure and industrial structure, vigorously increase the production of marketable products, actively improve technology, and accelerate the updating of products. We must do everything possible to activate circulation, increase exports, and open up domestic and international markets. Next year is a crucial year for stabilizing and developing the economy. The State Council has recently held national planning, financial, and other meetings to deploy the economic work for next year.

Yuan Mu also spoke about the international and Eastern European situations that the students were concerned about. He said, "No matter how the international situation changes, China will always adhere to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other parties. On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we will continue to develop relations with all countries in the world, and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we will continue to develop economic and trade exchanges with all countries in the world. The policy of opening up to the outside world will not change.

Yuan Mu emphasized that our Party is a mature Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, our country is a great People's Republic that has been tempered by long-term revolutionary wars and won with the blood of tens of millions of martyrs, and our people are a great people with a glorious revolutionary tradition who have never yielded to any external pressure. The Chinese people will definitely continue to advance along the socialist road they have chosen. The Chinese people, including the Communist Party of China, have the spirit and confidence to pass on the banner of socialism from generation to generation. He also said that no matter what different views you students may have, I believe there is one thing we all have in common, that is, you all love your country and do not want to be bullied by others. Treason has no market in China! At this point, the venue erupted in prolonged, enthusiastic applause.

Then, Yuan Mu and others spent another hour or so, in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and with a candid attitude, answering many questions raised by the students about domestic and international situations based on their personal understanding. The atmosphere in the venue was lively and harmonious. At the end, many students enthusiastically gathered around Yuan Mu, Wang Jia Luo, Yuan Li Ben, and other comrades, sending them out of the venue with warmth.

    袁木等与北大学生交流对国内外形势看法
    现在国家稳定政策稳定人心稳定
    社会主义旗帜要一代一代扛下去
    新华社北京12月30日电　（记者张宝瑞、江钱峰）日前，应北京大学学生会和研究生会的约请，国务院发言人袁木，中共北京市委副书记汪家镠，中共北京市委常委、秘书长袁立本，到北京大学与部分学生交流对当前国内国际形势的看法，并回答了学生们关心和感兴趣的问题。
    在热烈的气氛中，袁木首先发表了一小时的即席讲话。
    袁木说，我今天不是以政府发言人的身份来的，是以同学们的朋友的身份来的，是来和同学们交流一下对一些事情的看法。我先讲一讲对平息反革命暴乱后中国形势的回顾。动乱和暴乱发生期间，中国的确曾面临着被颠覆的危险，当时党内党外许多同志忧心忡忡，夜不能眠。平暴之后，这6个多月来，从主流上看，总的情况是国家稳定，政策稳定，人心稳定，社会秩序迅速恢复正常。当然，也还存在着不可忽视的不安定因素。但总的情况表明，中国共产党领导的拥有11亿人口的中国仍然在社会主义道路上前进，我们的国家仍然以改革开放、蓬勃向上的姿态展现在世界人民的面前。我认为6个月来形势的发展说明了以下几点：第一，我国人民的绝大多数是拥护共产党，热爱社会主义的；如果没有越来越多的人民的支持，我国局势不可能稳定。第二，我们的党是经得起考验的，在那样大的风浪面前，在那样惊心动魄的斗争当中，党没有丧失原则。我们党在平暴以后是深刻反思的，是从反思中努力改进自己的工作的，是以郑重的马克思主义态度来纠正自己的失误的。我们的党是经过长期斗争的考验，同人民群众有着血肉联系的党，而不是一个一冲就垮的党。第三，我们的军队是忠于党、忠于人民、忠于社会主义祖国的人民军队。尽管在一段时间里有相当一部分人对军队执行党和政府的命令断然平息暴乱不那么理解，但是随着事实真象的披露，越来越多的人拥护党和政府所采取的措施。应该说，经过血与火的考验，军民团结进一步加强了。第四，党的十三届四中全会选举的新的中央领导集体，正在以他们的实际行动逐步得到越来越多的人们的支持和信任。他们正在努力全面地贯彻党的基本路线，坚持改革开放，在采取重大决策时多走群众路线和广泛征求党内外人士的意见，加强同人民群众的联系。第五，我们取得了稳定局势的初步经验，我认为最重要的是：（1）努力坚持四项基本原则和改革开放的统一，既要坚持改革开放，又要坚持改革开放的社会主义方向，使两者统一于建设有中国特色的社会主义的实践。（2）由各级领导干部带头，实实在在地不说空话，多做实事，努力解决人民迫切希望解决的一些问题，如惩治腐败，加强廉政建设，改进党风，稳定发展经济等。（3）保持党的基本方针政策的稳定性和连续性。许多改革开放措施要在保持政策稳定和连续的基础上，逐步加以充实和完善。政策稳定，人心就稳定。
    袁木接着向同学们讲了我国的经济情况。他说，事实证明改革开放10年来，我国的经济建设取得了巨大成就。这10年间，我国国民生产总值平均每年以接近10％的速度向前发展，增长了1.51倍。和同一期间世界各国的情况相比，我国的经济增长率居于世界前列。我们应该充分肯定10年改革开放的成就，同时如实估计面临的经济困难。现在的困难不是这一两年来才出现的，是从1984年下半年开始就出现经济过热等问题而逐步积累起来的。为此，要进行较长时间的治理整顿。一年来的治理整顿已初见成效，主要表现在几个方面：（1）总量控制取得初步效果，投资需求、消费需求双膨胀得到抑制。（2）今年农业情况比较好，全国粮食产量预计接近或略微超过1984年的历史最高水平。（3）信贷规模和货币发行控制得比较好，城乡居民储蓄增长较多，金融形势好转。（4）今年物价上涨幅度略低于去年，新涨价的因素比去年少，涨势逐月下降，广大群众对物价上涨的紧张心理逐步缓解。但是，在治理整顿过程中又出现了市场销售疲软、企业资金紧张、待业人员增加等新问题。我们不能因为出现新矛盾而动摇治理整顿的信心和决心，同时也不能掉以轻心，要努力研究新情况，解决新问题。要动员和组织企业努力调整产品结构和产业结构，大力增产适销对路的产品，积极提高技术，加快产品的更新换代。要千方百计搞活流通，增加出口，开拓国内和国际市场。明年是稳定发展经济的很关键的一年，国务院最近已相继召开全国计划、财政等会议，对明年的经济工作做了部署。
    袁木还讲了学生们所关心的国际和东欧局势的问题。他说，无论国际风云如何变幻，中国始终坚持不干涉别国内政和不干涉别党内部事务的原则，在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续发展同世界各国的关系，在平等互利的基础上继续发展同世界各国的经济贸易往来，实行对外开放的方针政策决不会变。
    袁木强调说，我们的党是用马列主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的成熟的党，我们的国家是经过长期革命战争的洗礼、用几千万烈士的鲜血换来的伟大的人民共和国，我们的人民是具有光荣的革命斗争传统，从来不屈服于任何外来的压力的伟大的人民。我国人民必将坚定地沿着自己选择的社会主义道路走下去。中国人民包括中国共产党人有志气、有信心把社会主义的旗帜一代一代地扛下去。他还说，在座的同学们不论在这样那样的观点上有什么不同，但我相信有一点是共同的，那就是你们都热爱自己的祖国，决不愿意受外人的欺负。卖国主义在中国是没有市场的！这时，会场响起长时间的热烈掌声。
    接着，袁木等又用了一个多小时，本着实事求是的精神和坦诚的态度，根据他们个人的认识，回答了同学们提出的许多有关国内和国际形势的问题。会场气氛是活跃的、融洽的。结束时，许多同学高兴地簇拥着袁木、汪家镠、袁立本等同志，热情地把他们送出会场。
