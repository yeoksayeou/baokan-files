    China's remote sensing technology for mineral exploration has reached international standards. A report from our newspaper states that 46 scientific and technological personnel from six units, including the Institute of Remote Sensing Applications of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, completed the national key scientific and technological research project "Application of Remote Sensing Technology in Geological Mineral Exploration" under the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" after three years of work. On December 21, after an expert review and acceptance, it was concluded that the results have reached an advanced international level.

    For the first time, scientific and technological personnel applied this technology to the vast northern region of Xinjiang, discovering and identifying 14 significant gold, copper, and tin mines of great value.
