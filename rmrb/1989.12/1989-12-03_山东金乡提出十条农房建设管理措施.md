Jining County proposes ten measures for rural housing construction management:

1. All construction teams engaged in residential building in the county will be organized into several construction teams, each with more than 15 people, including 5 third-level or above technicians and 3 second-level or above technicians, and registered.

2. Construction teams from other counties must obtain an introduction letter from their local rural housing management office and register with the rural housing management office in the county where the project is located.

3. Construction teams for buildings in townships and county cities for government agencies, enterprises, and institutions will be arranged by the county construction commission.

4. Homeowners must sign a construction contract with the construction team, pay the construction fee to the township rural housing management office, and obtain a construction permit and a construction notice before starting work.

5. For the construction of brick or flat-roofed houses, the construction fee should be calculated based on the area above the indoor floor, with the fee controlled within 7 to 10 yuan per square meter of building area. The construction fee for other buildings can be negotiated with the construction team.

6. The owner is responsible for providing scaffolding and ropes, while the construction team is responsible for providing formwork, buckets, and small construction tools.

7. The construction team must follow the construction contract, ensure construction quality, and not delay work for any reason. The owner must ensure the supply of materials.

8. After the house is completed and passes the inspection, the construction fee can be collected from the township rural housing management office. If the construction does not meet the contract requirements, the construction fee will be appropriately deducted and returned to the owner. If rework is needed, the construction team will be responsible for both labor and materials.

9. Each township rural housing management office can collect an appropriate management fee from the total construction fee of the construction team.

10. Each township can formulate corresponding management measures and penalties based on its actual situation to ensure the healthy development of rural housing construction management.
