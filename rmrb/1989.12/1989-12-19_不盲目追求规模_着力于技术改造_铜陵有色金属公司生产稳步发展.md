The second-largest copper smelting base in China, Anhui Tongling Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation, has avoided blindly pursuing scale expansion and instead focused on using limited financial resources for technological upgrades. This strategy has helped the company overcome difficulties and achieve steady production growth. In the first 11 months of this year, the company's total output value and tax revenue both increased by 10% compared to the same period last year, setting a new historical record.

Tongling Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation is a key enterprise established in the early years of the People's Republic of China, serving as the country's first large-scale copper mining and smelting integrated enterprise. Due to aging mines, factories, and equipment, as well as some production processes that are not well-coordinated, the company's development speed has been slow, and economic benefits have been low. In recent years, the company has decided to focus on internal reforms and technological upgrades to drive production, based on China's national conditions and the company's actual situation. They have invested over 100 million yuan in 150 technological upgrade projects, extending 14 main shafts and developing 58 new shaft sections. They have also implemented automated ore dressing, enhancing the company's five major production capacities. Self-produced copper ore has increased from 1.5 million tons to 3 million tons. Additionally, by relying on technological upgrades to achieve high-quality and deep processing of products, the company has increased the production of blister copper by one-third and the production of electrolytic copper from 2,000 tons per year to 20,000 tons.

Technological upgrades have injected new vitality into Tongling Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation. Currently, the company's copper processing capacity has reached a significant scale, with products increasing from the original 13 types to over 110 types. High-quality products account for more than 85% of the total output value. Among these, products exported to the United States, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions generate over 5 million US dollars in foreign exchange annually.

At present, the company has basically formed a new industrial system that integrates mining, ore dressing, smelting, electrolysis, processing, and export earnings, entering a stage of high-efficiency and stable development.

    不盲目追求规模　着力于技术改造
    铜陵有色金属公司生产稳步发展
    新华社合肥12月18日电  （记者王正忠、通讯员殷修武）我国第二大铜冶炼基地安徽铜陵有色金属公司不盲目追求建设规模，着力于把有限的财力用在技术改造上，使企业走出了困境，生产稳步发展。今年头11个月全公司完成产值和利税都比去年同期增长10％。创历史最好水平。
    铜陵有色金属公司是建国初期重点建设的我国第一个大型铜采选炼联合企业。由于矿老、厂老、设备老化，有些生产工艺流程不够配套，企业发展速度不快，经济效益也不高。近几年来，这家企业从我国的国情和企业的实际出发，决定走内涵改造发展生产的路子。他们抓住影响公司经济效益的矿山开采和铜的冶炼两个“牛鼻子”，投资1亿多元，进行了150项技术改造，先后延伸14条大井，开拓58条新井段，并且实行了选矿自动化，使企业的五大生产能力增强，自产铜料由原来的1.5万吨上升到3万吨，同时，他们还依靠技术改造向产品的高档次和深度加工要效益，使粗铜的产量增加1／3，电解铜的产量由年产2000吨增加到2万吨。
    技术改造给铜陵有色金属公司增添了新的活力和生机，如今这家公司的铜材加工能力已成规模，产品由原来的13种发展到110多种，其中优质产品产值占总产值的85％以上。其中销往美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、巴基斯坦、斯里兰卡、香港等国家和地区的产品，年创汇达500多万美元。
    目前，这家公司已基本形成了采矿、选矿、冶炼、电解、加工、出口创汇一条龙新的工业体系，进入了高效稳定发展的良性循环。
