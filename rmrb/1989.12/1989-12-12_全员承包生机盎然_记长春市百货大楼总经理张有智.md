Changchun City Department Store is one of the pilot units for contracting in Jilin Province.

In May 1988, the general manager of Changchun City Department Store was selected through a bidding process held at the Municipal Workers' Cultural Palace. A man in his fifties, tall and energetic, stepped onto the stage and presented his bid proposal of "strict management, scientific management, thrift, and democratic management," which earned him a round of applause from the 1,700 employees present. He later won the bid with 95% of the votes of confidence and signed a contract with the state for a 6% and 8% annual increase in sales and profits, respectively, for a guaranteed three-year period.

He is Zhang Youzhi, who has long served as a leader in the Changchun Municipal Commerce Bureau.

**Innovation Brings Vitality**

Taking on the responsibility of managing the largest department store in the province, Zhang Youzhi understood that only through innovation and progress could the store thrive. Over the past two years, he has reformed the retail business model that had been in place for over 30 years, implementing a full-employee contract system where each of the 952 counters in the store is managed by a group. This system has greatly motivated the employees to actively organize goods, expand sales, and conduct business more freely.

Zhang Youzhi also broke the old rules that prevented retail enterprises from participating in international trade. With the assistance of provincial and municipal foreign trade departments, he established mutual trade with cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, and Kustanai in the Soviet Union, involving more than ten types of goods worth 7.8 million yuan. He also reached an agreement with the Siam Commercial Bank in Thailand to jointly establish a joint venture, extending the store's reach to international markets and developing an outward-looking business model.

The full-employee contract system has revitalized the enterprise, and the employees' sense of ownership has never been stronger. The business strategies have never been more expansive. In 1988, the store achieved sales of 172 million yuan and profits of 11.5 million yuan, marking an increase of 18.16% and 32.03% respectively compared to the previous year, thus exceeding the contracted targets. From January to September this year, despite the sluggish sales in many department stores across the country, Changchun City Department Store's sales and profits still increased by 17.8% and 16.2% respectively compared to the same period last year, achieving continuous growth.

**Reputation is Key in Market Competition**

How can state-owned commercial enterprises play their main role in market competition? Zhang Youzhi believes that reputation is the lifeblood of an enterprise, and the reputation and competitiveness of retail businesses mainly depend on quality service. Therefore, Zhang Youzhi, in his contracting efforts, has not forgotten the social benefits and has continuously improved services.

To uphold the store's motto of "customers first, service first, reputation first," he organized a service excellence campaign throughout the store. For example, ensuring a full range of goods for customers to choose from, stabilizing prices to benefit the people, providing warm and beautiful service, and taking responsibility after sales with a "three-guarantee" policy to ensure customer satisfaction. From January to September this year, Zhang Youzhi decided to offer discounts on 5,157 types of goods, totaling 1.11 million yuan in discounts, effectively stabilizing local department store prices.

Over the past two years, the store's sales staff have done 656,000 good deeds for customers, receiving 28,783 letters of praise, and have been named the best store in Changchun twice.

    全员承包生机盎然
    ——记长春市百货大楼总经理张有智
    余久喜
    长春市百货大楼是吉林省承包试点单位。
    1988年5月长春市百货大楼总经理招标承包大会在市工人文化宫大剧场举行。一位五十开外，身材魁梧，精力充沛的人走上会台，讲他“从严治店，科学管店，勤俭办店，民主理店”的投标方案，博得全场1700名职工的热烈掌声。后来以95％的信任票一举中标，与国家签订了销售、利润年递增幅度为6％和8％，一定三年不变的承包合同。
    他，就是长期担任长春市一商业局领导工作的张有智。
      勇于创新焕发活力
    承包全省最大的百货商店，重任在肩，唯开拓进取才有盎然生机。两年中，张有智改革了固守30多年的零售商业经营模式，推行了全员抵押柜组承包经营责任制，将全店952节柜台全部包到柜组。通过柜组承包极大地调动了广大职工的经营积极性，人人千方百计地组织货源，扩大购销，放开了手脚，做活了买卖。
    张有智还打破了零售企业不能参加国际贸易的旧框框，在省、市外贸部门的协助下，与苏联莫斯科、列宁格勒、库茨贝克等城市开展十多个品种，780万元商品的互惠贸易，还与泰国闻闻商界百货公司就双方兴办合资企业达成了意向协议，把购销触角延伸到国外，开发了外向型经营。
    全员承包焕发了企业的活力，职工的主人翁责任感从来没有像现在这样高，经营思路从来没有像现在这样宽广。1988年实现销售额1.72亿元、利润额1150万元，分别比上年增长18.16％和32.03％，超额完成了承包指标。今年1至9月份，在各地许多百货商场销售疲软的情况下，长春市百货大楼销售额和利润额仍比去年同期提高17.8％和16.2％，实现了持续增长。
    信誉为本　竞争市场
    如何发挥国营商业主渠道作用，在市场竞争中取胜？张有智认为信誉是企业的生命，而零售商业的信誉和竞争能力主要取决于优质服务。因此，张有智承包不忘社会效益，不断创优服务。
    为了坚持百货大楼“顾客第一、服务第一、信誉第一”的宗旨，他在全店组织开展服务达标活动，如商品齐全，任意选购，让顾客可心；平抑物价，让利于民，让顾客顺心；热情服务，美化店容，让顾客舒心；售后负责，实行“三保”，让顾客放心，等等；今年1至9月，张有智决定对5157种商品，实行让利销售，让利额达111万元，有效地平抑了当地的百货物价。
    两年来，全店营业员共为顾客做好事65.6万件，收到表扬信28783封，两次被评为长春市最佳商店。
