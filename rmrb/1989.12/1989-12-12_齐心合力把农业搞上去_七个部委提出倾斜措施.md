The People's Daily today published an article titled "United Efforts to Boost Agriculture – Seven Ministries Discuss Agriculture" written by reporter Zeng Yang. The article reports that the decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to rapidly create a nationwide enthusiasm for prioritizing, supporting, and developing agriculture has resonated strongly among the various ministries under the State Council. In early December, reporters interviewed officials from seven ministries under the State Council, who all proposed measures to support agriculture.

Consider Problems in the Order of Agriculture, Light Industry, and Heavy Industry

Liu Zhongyi, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, said that in recent years, agricultural production has stagnated and lacks momentum. In the future, in terms of macro decision-making, we must adhere to the guiding principle of "agriculture as the foundation." In planning arrangements, we must consider problems in the order of agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. While ensuring the normal operation and steady development of conventional agricultural production and construction, the state will strive to strengthen the work of developmental agriculture and actively support the construction of agricultural bases in the central and western regions and in old, minority, border, and poor areas that have development potential and can increase the production of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, and sugar.

Mobilize Scientific and Technological Forces to Serve Agriculture

Guo Shuyan, Deputy Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, said that we will mobilize the nation's scientific and technological forces to create a trend of valuing agriculture, researching and promoting agricultural science and technology, and serving the revitalization of agriculture. The promotion and application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements is an important link in transforming science and technology into direct productive forces. In the future, we will work with relevant state departments to focus on increasing production technologies for major crops such as grain, cotton, and oil, and promote 300 advanced and applicable agricultural scientific and technological achievements. As an important force for technological agriculture, the "Spark Program" will focus on promoting the formation and development of regional pillar industries in rural areas, and will absorb relevant technologies in a coordinated manner. We will establish and improve a rural scientific and technological support service system that covers pre-production, in-production, and post-production, and will streamline the channels for scientific and technological input into rural areas.

The State Will Increase Investment as Much as Possible

Jian Huicheng, Deputy Minister of Finance, said that in the next few years, the state finance will, according to the financial situation, adopt various measures to increase investment in agriculture as much as possible. In the future, the financial departments will strengthen the tracking and feedback of agricultural funds, check whether the funds are in place, and make the allocation of agricultural funds linked to benefits. For some funds, we will implement paid use and rolling operation to increase the internal driving force and vitality of agricultural investment.

Water Conservancy Work Will Fully Serve Agriculture

Yang Zhenhuai, Minister of Water Resources, said that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." Agricultural water conservancy construction is not only the forerunner of agricultural production but also an important measure to maintain the momentum of agricultural development. To stabilize and develop agricultural production, the focus of water conservancy work should be on preventing water disasters, promoting water conservancy, improving flood control and irrigation, and building high-yield and stable-yield fields that can withstand droughts and floods.

Forestry Will Provide Ecological Barriers

Gao Dezhan, Minister of Forestry, said that forestry is an important condition for improving and stabilizing the agricultural ecological environment, ensuring stable and high agricultural production, ensuring the effectiveness of water conservancy facilities, and enhancing the momentum of agricultural development. Forestry should focus on building a shelterbelt system, mainly constructing farmland shelterbelts, water conservation forests, soil and water conservation forests, sand-fixing and windbreak forests, and livestock and grassland protection forests. We should vigorously promote afforestation and create a farmland shelterbelt network. In the future, forestry construction will actively cooperate with the transformation of medium and low-yield fields, agricultural development, and water conservancy project construction, and will take local conditions and preventive measures into account.

Agricultural Materials Supply Will Be Guaranteed

Cai Ninglin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Materials, said that next year, under the condition of reducing the unified allocation of materials by the state, not only will the supply of agricultural materials be guaranteed, but it will also be increased as much as possible. First, for the materials needed by agriculture, such as steel and timber, we will guarantee the supply according to the national plan. Second, for the materials needed by support industries for agriculture, such as fertilizer plants and pesticide plants, we will guarantee the supply according to the plan. Third, for the support of poor areas, we will select and focus on projects with social and economic benefits to implement labor in exchange for relief. Fourth, in the supply of disaster relief materials, we will do a good job of investigation and implementation of emergency plans.

Work Hard to Boost Agriculture

He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, said to the reporter, "The Central Committee has proposed to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in agriculture, which is a great encouragement to us in the agricultural sector. We will organize a large number of cadres from the department and directly affiliated units to go to the front lines of rural areas, propagate the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and study and solve problems in agricultural production.

    齐心合力把农业搞上去
    七个部委提出倾斜措施
    据新华社北京12月11日电　今天出版的《中国城乡开发报》在一版刊登了该报记者曾阳采写的《齐心合力把农业搞上去——国务院七部委负责人谈农业》的消息。
    消息说，党的十三届五中全会提出的迅速在全党全国造成一个重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的热潮的决定，在国务院各部委引起很大反响。记者12月初采访了国务院七个部委的负责人，他们纷纷提出向农业倾斜的措施。
    按农轻重次序考虑问题
    国家计委副主任刘中一说，近几年，农业生产徘徊不前，发展后劲不足。今后，在宏观决策上一定要坚持“农业为基础”的指导思想，在计划安排上要按农轻重的次序考虑问题，在保证常规性农业生产建设正常运行、稳步发展的同时，国家将努力加强开发性农业的工作，积极支持中西部地区、老少边穷地区具有开发潜力、能够增产粮棉油糖主要农产品的基地建设。
    动员科技力量服务农业
    国家科委副主任郭树言说，我们将动员全国的科技力量，形成重视农业，研究和推广农业科技，为振兴农业服务的热潮。农业科技成果的推广应用是科学技术转化为直接生产力的重要环节。今后我们将会同国家有关部门着重围绕粮棉油等大田作物增产技术，推广300项先进适用的农业科技成果，做为科技兴农重要力量的“星火计划”，要把推动农村区域性支柱产业的形成和发展作为工作重点，把相关的技术成龙配套地加以吸收；要建立健全面向产前、产中、产后的农村科技支撑服务体系，理顺科技输入农村的渠道。
        国家将尽可能增加投入
    财政部副部长项怀诚说，今后几年，国家财政将根据财力的状况，采取各种措施，尽可能地增加农业资金的投入。今后，财政部门对农用资金，要加强跟踪反馈，检查资金是否到位，对农用资金投放，今后也要使之与效益挂钩，对部分资金实行有偿使用、循环滚动，以增加支农资金投入的内在动力和活力。
          水利工作全力为农业服务
    水利部部长杨振怀说，“水利是农业的命脉”，农田水利建设不仅是农业生产的先行，也是保持农业发展后劲的重要措施。为稳定和发展农业生产，水利工作的重点要放在除水害、兴水利，搞好防洪灌溉，建设旱涝保收高产稳产田上。
          林业要提供生态屏障
    林业部部长高德占谈到，林业是改善和稳定农业生态环境，保障农业稳产高产，保障水利设施发挥效能，增强农业发展后劲的重要条件。林业要把重点放在建设防护林体系上，主要是建设农田防护林、水源涵养林、水土保持林、防护固沙林和护牧护草林；要大力植树造林，营造农田防护林网。今后的林业建设，要积极配合中、低产田改造、农田开发和水利工程建设，因地制宜，因害设防。
          农用物资供应有保证
    物资部副部长蔡宁林说，明年，在国家统一调配物资将减少的情况下，对农用物资不仅要保证供给，而且要尽可能增加。一是对农业所需的钢材、木材等，要根据国家计划，保证供给；二是对支农工业，如化肥厂、农药厂等计划所需物资，要给予保证；三是对贫困地区的扶持，要根据项目的社会效益、经济效益，有选择、有重点地以工代赈；四是在救灾物资供应方面，要搞好调查和急救计划的落实。
        扎扎实实工作把农业搞上去
    农业部部长何康对记者说，党中央提出要集中力量办好农业，这对我们农业部门是极大的鼓舞。我们将从部机关和直属单位组织一大批干部下到农村第一线，宣传十三届五中全会精神，研究解决农业生产中的问题。
