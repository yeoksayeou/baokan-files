The Party Branch and Village Committee of Shunchengguan Village in Xingxiu County have significantly increased the total industrial and agricultural output value. Instead of spending money on building office buildings, they invested in improving educational conditions. They spent 1.5 million yuan over two years to build a new primary school in the style of ancient architecture at the site where the ancient scholar Guo Tai (style name Linzong) once taught—on the old site of the primary school. The new school, named "Linzong Academy," features a magnificent and imposing architectural group with a classical and elegant environment.

The academy is divided into four sections. The first section is the courtyard, used for the kindergarten. The second and third sections are the sculpture courtyard and the pavilion courtyard, respectively, used for the primary school. These sections include classrooms, a library, an auditorium, and research rooms. The fourth section is a 200-meter running track for sports.

The academy currently has 12 classes for primary school students and 6 classes for kindergarten, with over 800 students receiving education from kindergarten to primary school. The village's educational funds account for 5.3% of the total production value for the same period.

The leaders of Shunchengguan Village are truly dedicated to promoting education and cultivating people.

    兴学育人
    介休县顺城关村党总支、村委会，在工农业总产值大幅度提高的情况下，舍不得花钱盖办公楼，却舍得花钱彻底改变办学条件。他们投资150多万元，用了两年时间，在古代文化名人郭泰（字林宗）设馆教书的地方（原小学旧址），新建了一所古典式建筑的小学——“林宗书院”。雄伟壮观的建筑群，古朴典雅，书院环境优雅清新。
    全院分为四组，第一组为门庭院，学前班幼儿用；第二、三组为雕塑院、凉亭院，供小学用，有教室，图书阅览室、礼堂、教研室等；第四组为200米跑道的体育场。设施配套齐全。
    书院现有12个教学班、6个幼儿班、800多名学生，在这里接受学前到小学的教育。这个村教育经费达到同期生产总值的5.3％。
    顺城关村的领导，堪称兴学育人的有心人。
