This is a project built by the soldiers of the Second Water and Electricity Corps of the Armed Police, who have worked tirelessly for five years, and is a key project handed over to the state with excellent results.

    This ship lock is a crucial component of the Wannan Hydropower Station, a key project of the country's "Seventh Five-Year Plan."
