The artistic image of Mao Zedong as a great leader has been depicted in numerous literary works. Can this image of Mao Zedong as a great man be presented and established through a radio play? This is a pioneering and groundbreaking challenge. Radio play director Liu Baoyi was deeply interested in Quan Yanchi's documentary literature "The Giant's Charm." With his creative passion surging, after thorough preparation and meticulous planning, he finally adapted this work into a stereo radio play, naming it "The Giant's Character." Liu Baoyi directed it personally and invited renowned actors Zhang Keyao, Zheng Bangyu, and Long Yishun to portray Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi, respectively. For the first time, Chinese radio drama has featured Mao Zedong as the main protagonist, presenting him in a direct and positive light. The radio industry was invigorated, and the broad audience was captivated.

The creators focused on the auditory aspects, crafting the work for the ears to compensate for the lack of visual imagery in radio. They leveraged the imaginative and poetic qualities of auditory art, centering the play on Mao Zedong's "giant character," avoiding competition with films in terms of historical scenes and battle sequences. Instead, they used sound to create the drama and characters, emphasizing the giant's character, and ensuring coherence within the nearly 60-minute duration. The creators used war as a backdrop, depicting the war abstractly while focusing on the characters. They portrayed both our side and the enemy's, highlighting Mao Zedong as well as Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, and Peng Dehuai. The former achieved a contrasting effect, using the negative to highlight the positive; the latter achieved a harmonious effect, where all elements complemented each other, enhancing the overall impact.

Mao Zedong was a military strategist and a great leader. Strategically, he held the enemy in contempt, but tactically, he took the enemy seriously. Even when victory was assured, he planned for contingencies, maintaining a clear mind. His great wisdom and courage were tempered with humor, impulsiveness, and stubbornness. On the eve of a major battle, he strategized meticulously, securing victory from afar, treating soldiers and subordinates like family. Mao Zedong's character was not formed in a vacuum; it was honed through countless trials and tribulations. His core character trait was an unyielding spirit and boundless joy. These aspects were all vividly portrayed in the play.

In the finale of "The Giant's Character," set against the backdrop of Shaanxi, Chairman Mao stood on a wooden boat on the Yellow River, taking a commemorative photo and meaningfully said, "A chapter of history has passed... The living must press on." Chairman Mao did not take the boat; instead, he had two bodyguards accompany him as he swam across the Yellow River during the flood season. His grandeur, high spirits, and profound implications left one's imagination soaring and thoughts lingering. "The Yellow River is the soul of our nation!" Chairman Mao, standing in the midst of the river, was baptized by it, revealing his resolve and displaying the character of a giant, embodying the essence of a great leader. He would face the future challenges with unwavering confidence! This meaningful ending, with its stereo effects, showcased its advantages, presenting a majestic and layered atmosphere, rich with an epic sense.

Everything relies on sound; within the sound, there is everything. This is the unique feature of radio drama. Language, sound effects, music, voices, and noise... like clouds and mountains, trees and smoke, they support each other, each reaching its peak, together composing the magnificent chapter of "The Giant's Character." Zhang Keyao, who played Mao Zedong, had a deep understanding of Mao Zedong. He broke away from the superficial imitation of dialect and "leadership tone," elevating the performance with a touch of elegance, capturing the extraordinary demeanor and individual characteristics, providing a fresh and intimate feel. In contemporary artworks depicting leaders, this is a significant breakthrough.

    富有特色的领袖形象
    ——听立体声广播剧《巨人的性格》
    张凤铸
    毛泽东作为一代领袖的艺术形象，纷见于许多文艺作品中。能否把毛泽东的伟人形象，用广播剧表现出来，树立起来？这是具有开拓性、突破性的一大难题。广播剧导演刘保毅对权延赤的纪实文学《巨人的魅力》怀有极大兴趣，创作激情随之荡漾，经过充分酝酿和精心构思，他终于把这部作品改编成立体声广播剧，命名为《巨人的性格》。刘保毅亲自执导，还聘请了张克瑶、郑邦玉、隆义顺等名演员分别演播毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时等重要人物。中国广播剧艺术首次以毛泽东为第一主人公，正面表现毛泽东。广播界为之振奋，广大听众为之吸引。
    编导者在声音上下功夫，在耳朵上作文章，避广播没有视觉画面形象之短，扬听觉艺术富有想象性、意境美之长，以毛泽东的“巨人的性格”为剧作的着力点，不与电影在历史画卷、战争场面上争短长。在声音上立戏、树人，突出巨人的性格，宜聚不宜散，在近60分钟内完成全剧，正是编导者的高明之处。编导者以战争为背景，虚写战争，实写人物。既写我方，又写敌方，既写毛泽东，又写周恩来、任弼时、彭德怀。前者达到相反相成，以反衬正的艺术效果；后者达到众星捧月，相辅相成，相得益彰的艺术效果。
    毛泽东是一代军事家，一个伟人。他战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人，胜利在握时，他布置上随机应变，以防万一，始终保持头脑清醒；大智大勇中不乏幽默感、任性和犟脾气；大战前夕，运筹帷幄，决胜千里间隙，与战士、小鬼情同手足；毛泽东的性格不是凭空而来，是千锤百炼，逐步形成的。他的性格的内核就是奋斗不息，其乐无穷。这些在剧中都得到充分的表现。
      《巨人的性格》结尾处，以陕北为背景，站在黄河木船上的毛主席，照了一张像留作纪念，饶有深意地说道：“一段历史过去了……活人还得往前走。”毛主席不坐船，要两个警卫员陪他游过凌汛期的黄河，其气魄之大，其兴致之高，其涵义之深，令人浮想联翩，品味再三……。“黄河是我们民族的魂！”毛主席在中流击水，在黄河上洗礼，显其志，见巨人性格，呈伟人本色，他将充满信心去迎接未来一个个挑战！这意味无穷的尾声，立体声效果出来了，优势显示出来了，气势磅礴，层次分明，富有史诗般的意境。
    一切靠声音，声音中有一切，这就是广播剧的特色。语言、音响、音乐、人声、噪音……如云山烟树，交相扶持，各臻其妙，共同谱写《巨人的性格》的华章。扮演毛泽东的张克瑶，对毛泽东有了一番研究，他突破了摹仿方言的“领导腔”形似层次，有了升华，有点韵味，气度非凡的个性特点出来了，给人以新鲜感和亲切感，在当今表现领袖人物的艺术作品中有新的突破。
