	The streets of Bucharest on Christmas Day were relatively calm today, with sporadic gunshots heard in some areas. Vehicles and pedestrians were seen on the streets, food stores had reopened, and the radio broadcasted the situation of church services for Christmas. However, there were still barricades at some major intersections, and vehicles and pedestrians had to undergo checks. In the Republic Square, where the armed clashes between the forces supporting and opposing Ceausescu were most intense in the past few days, more than 20 tanks and armored vehicles were parked. The Central University Library on the north side of the Party Central Committee building has become a pile of ruins, and the State Council building is severely damaged.

	According to reports, gunfights in other cities in Romania are also gradually subsiding. In cities like Timisoara in the west, sporadic gunshots can still be heard, but no intense battles have occurred.

	According to a reporter from the Romanian News Agency, the number of deaths in Bucharest and Timisoara in the past few days is in the thousands, and the exact number will be known after some time.

	According to a report by Agence France-Presse on the 25th, the leader and spokesman of the recently established National Salvation Front of Romania, Iliescu, said that the situation in Romania is returning to normal, but the National Salvation Front currently does not plan to establish a new government. According to reports, the committee has decided to hold national elections in April next year.

    罗马尼亚局势趋向缓和
    新华社布加勒斯特12月25日电　圣诞节的布加勒斯特，今天比较平静，市内只有一些地区有时响起零落的枪声。大街上有行驶的车辆和行人，食品店已开门营业，电台播送了教堂举行圣诞节仪式的情况。但在一些主要路口还有路障，车辆和行人经过时需接受检查。在前几天支持和反对齐奥塞斯库的武装力量之间枪战最激烈的共和国广场上，停放着20余辆坦克和装甲车。党中央大厦北侧的大学中央图书馆已成一片废墟，国务委员会大厦损坏严重。
    据报道，罗马尼亚其他城市的枪战也在逐渐平息。在西部的蒂米什瓦拉等城市有时还可以听到零星的枪声，但没有发生激烈的战斗。
    据罗马尼亚通讯社人员告诉记者，几天内，在布加勒斯特和蒂米什瓦拉市“死亡人数数以千计”，确切的数字要等一段时间才能知道。
    据法新社25日报道，最近成立的罗马尼亚救国阵线委员会领导人和发言人伊利埃斯库说，罗马尼亚局势正在恢复正常，但救国阵线委员会目前不打算建立新政府。据报道，该委员会已决定于明年4月举行全国大选。
