Five years ago today, the governments of China and the United Kingdom formally signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing, confirming that China would resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Thus, the historical issue of Hong Kong was resolved satisfactorily, and the humiliation suffered by the Chinese people for over a century was washed away. What previous governments of China could not accomplish, the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has achieved. This historic event is a significant achievement in the diplomatic work of New China and an important step toward the reunification of the motherland. The entire Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong, are jubilant about this.

The resolution of the Hong Kong issue has eliminated the historical shadow between China and the UK, bringing the two countries to the best period in their history. Over the past few years, the Chinese government has made tremendous efforts to implement the Joint Declaration in cooperation with the British side. The Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the Sino-British Land Commission have been working effectively. Through consultations, all transitional arrangements related to travel documents and identity certificates for Hong Kong residents have been completed, resolving the issue of Hong Kong participating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade under the name "Hong Kong, China" after 1997. Multiple agreements have been reached and practical arrangements made regarding Hong Kong's continued participation in or maintenance of its status in international organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Universal Postal Union, the International Telecommunication Union, and the International Maritime Organization after 1997. Progress has also been made in areas such as the localization of Hong Kong laws, the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Agreement, arrangements for the transfer of fugitives between Hong Kong and relevant countries, and transitional arrangements for land contracts. Shortly after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the National People's Congress decided to establish the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to codify the basic policies of the Chinese government toward Hong Kong as stipulated in the Joint Declaration. After more than four years of joint efforts by mainland and Hong Kong drafting committee members, the Basic Law (Draft) for Consultation and the Basic Law (Draft) have been published and widely consulted in Hong Kong and the mainland. Currently, the drafting committee is working diligently on the final revisions of the Basic Law, which will be submitted to the Seventh Session of the Third National People's Congress for deliberation, approval, and promulgation next March.

Under the joint efforts of the Chinese and British governments and the people of Hong Kong, the situation in Hong Kong over the past few years has generally been good. The economy is thriving, society is stable, and the majority of citizens are living and working happily, contributing to making Hong Kong even more vibrant. It has been proven and will continue to be proven that the Chinese government has always faithfully upheld the Sino-British Joint Declaration and has conscientiously fulfilled all the obligations undertaken in this solemn international agreement.

The basic policies of the Chinese government toward Hong Kong, as stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, are based on the scientific concept of "One Country, Two Systems." The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee restored the Marxist principle of seeking truth from facts. With a respectful attitude toward history and reality, Deng Xiaoping, with the collective wisdom of the Central Committee, creatively proposed the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" as the basic policy for achieving national reunification. Regarding Hong Kong, the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" and the series of special policies formulated based on it are derived from Hong Kong's actual situation, fully considering Hong Kong's history and current status. It maintains national sovereignty while ensuring Hong Kong's continued stability and prosperity, aligning with the fundamental interests and common aspirations of the Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong, and also considering other interests, making it reasonable and feasible. Therefore, it has received genuine support from compatriots at home and abroad and widespread praise from international public opinion.

Hong Kong and the mainland are closely intertwined. Implementing the "One Country, Two Systems" policy in earnest, seeking unity in "One Country" and coexistence in "Two Systems," is the key to correctly handling the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland. This is true for the transitional period and even more so after 1997.

The core of "One Country, Two Systems" is national unity. Without national unity and without China resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, all issues are moot. The "One Country, Two Systems" policy clearly stipulates that the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be a local administrative region of the People's Republic of China, directly under the administration of the Central People's Government. The relationship between the Central People's Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is that of a central government and a local government. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region can enjoy a high degree of autonomy, but this high degree of autonomy is granted by the central government and can only be exercised under the sovereignty of the unified People's Republic of China. It does not imply that Hong Kong has any independent or semi-independent political entity. Therefore, implementing the "One Country, Two Systems" policy first and foremost requires safeguarding national sovereignty and the unity of the Chinese nation, and opposing any attempts to obstruct China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

Some people advocate for "isolating" and "insulating" Hong Kong from the mainland, and even more extremists suggest installing a "burglar-proof lock" between Hong Kong and the mainland, handing the "key" to the people of Hong Kong. This view completely ignores the indivisibility of China's sovereignty. It is not aimed at achieving a high degree of autonomy under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework but rather at turning "One Country, Two Systems" into "Two Countries, Two Systems," making Hong Kong an independent political entity, and permanently separating Hong Kong from the motherland. Everyone knows that Hong Kong has never had and will never have the conditions to separate from the mainland and achieve independence. As for the division of powers between the central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, this will be stipulated by the Basic Law. After 1997, the central government will respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and will not interfere with Hong Kong's specific affairs, but it is necessary for the central government to retain certain powers essential for a national government. This is a fundamental guarantee for safeguarding the interests of the unified nation. If the central government relinquishes all its powers, it could lead to chaos in Hong Kong that harms both national interests and Hong Kong's own interests. Therefore, retaining certain necessary powers by the central government is beneficial for both the nation and Hong Kong.

Some people, based on the so-called "democratic rejection of communism," advocate for accelerating the democratic process in Hong Kong's political system, suggesting that the time for direct elections for the entire Legislative Council should be significantly advanced compared to what is envisaged in the Basic Law (Draft), and emphasizing that this is the will of the people of Hong Kong, attempting to create a fait accompli to force the Chinese government to comply. We do not agree with this approach. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that we support the democratization of Hong Kong's political system, but it must be in accordance with the spirit of "One Country, Two Systems," must be gradual, and must consider the balanced participation of all strata, aligning with the provisions of the Basic Law, to ensure the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. If we talk about public opinion, we cannot just listen to the will of a few who appear to represent the public interest but actually have various purposes; we must also listen to the will of the silent majority in Hong Kong; we must listen not only to the will of the people of Hong Kong but also to the will of the entire Chinese people. Now, some people have abandoned the previously agreed principles of "gradual progress" and "alignment with the Basic Law," once again playing the "public opinion" card to demand an acceleration of the democratization of the political system, which makes one suspect that their goal is to use "democracy" as a pretext to establish a political model in Hong Kong that opposes the central government after 1997, damaging China's sovereignty. This is something we firmly cannot accept.

Currently, a noteworthy trend is that some people are trying to internationalize the Hong Kong issue. The Chinese government has always advocated for maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial and trade center and continuing to develop Hong Kong's economic relations with other countries and regions in the world, as this is beneficial for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. However, continuing to play the role of an international financial and trade center is entirely different from internationalizing the Hong Kong issue. Those who advocate for the internationalization of the Hong Kong issue are not driven by the needs of Hong Kong's economic development but rather aim to create a situation where international forces gradually intervene in Hong Kong's affairs politically, essentially rallying anti-communist and anti-China forces internationally to interfere with China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It is well known that Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the recovery of Hong Kong is a matter within China's sovereignty. Considering Hong Kong's historical and current situation and the good relationship between China and the UK since the founding of New China based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, after serious negotiations, China and the UK reached a bilateral agreement on resolving the Hong Kong issue. During the transitional period before 1997, the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is entirely a matter for the governments of China and the UK, and no other countries or international organizations have the right to interfere. After 1997, Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland and become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, and it absolutely cannot be turned into an "internationally administered" region. As an international city, other countries will have economic interests in Hong Kong. Our solution to the Hong Kong issue with the "One Country, Two Systems" concept also considers the factor of protecting the economic interests of other countries in Hong Kong. However, foreign economic interests in Hong Kong should be protected by the Basic Law of Hong Kong and relevant Hong Kong laws, and it is not allowed for foreign countries to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs politically. The argument that "other countries have economic interests in Hong Kong, so they naturally have political interests in Hong Kong's future arrangements and should participate in Hong Kong's affairs politically" is a theory of hegemony and power politics. In the 1980s, when the Chinese people have stood up, this theory is completely untenable.

Implementing the spirit of "One Country, Two Systems," people from the mainland and Hong Kong should respect each other, live in harmony, and respect each other's social systems and ways of life. In other words, you pursue your capitalism, and I pursue my socialism, without interfering with each other. We oppose damaging the sovereignty of the unified nation and turning "One Country, Two Systems" into "Two Countries, Two Systems," and we do not advocate using one system to absorb another, turning "One Country, Two Systems" into "One Country, One System." Chinese leaders have repeatedly solemnly declared that the Central People's Government will not change Hong Kong's capitalist system for at least 50 years and will not impose the socialist system and policies on Hong Kong. We hope that some people in Hong Kong will also not interfere with or attempt to change the socialist system of the mainland and will not import capitalism into the mainland.

As part of the Chinese people, the people of Hong Kong undoubtedly enjoy the right to participate in the management of state affairs in accordance with the law. We welcome the people of Hong Kong to care about and participate in state affairs and welcome the people of Hong Kong to offer opinions and suggestions on the work of the mainland. However, when the people of Hong Kong participate in the management of state affairs, they must respect the socialist system of the mainland and abide by the Constitution and laws of the state. Currently, Hong Kong residents enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of the press in accordance with the law. According to the provisions of the Basic Law (Draft) for Hong Kong, after 1997, Hong Kong residents will continue to enjoy these freedoms. During the transitional period and after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the speech and actions of Hong Kong people will certainly be regulated by Hong Kong laws, and as Chinese citizens participating in state affairs, they must also accept the regulation of the Constitution and relevant laws of the state. When the people of Hong Kong offer opinions to the Central People's Government, they should do so through legal channels and in legal ways, such as through representatives of the National People's Congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, or through letters and visits. If they do not do so and use improper means to express their views, it is likely to backfire and harm the harmonious relationship between the two places. Moreover, the people of the mainland and the people of Hong Kong are one family, and in handling the relationship between the two places, we must not only follow the law but also follow reason. We must consider the fundamental differences in political, economic, and social systems between the two places, as well as the differences in ideology and values, seek common ground while reserving differences, and understand each other. If we frequently impose our own views on others and do things that hurt feelings, it will be harmful to the nation and detrimental to ourselves. Therefore, we hope that both the mainland and Hong Kong will prioritize harmonious coexistence and create a good atmosphere for the smooth implementation of "One Country, Two Systems."

Currently, there are indeed a very small number of people who use Hong Kong as a base to subvert the Central People's Government and the socialist system of the mainland. They openly advocate for overthrowing the central government and promoting Western-style "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" in the mainland. They maliciously attack and slander our leaders, spreading rumors to incite anti-Communist and anti-socialist fervor, even infiltrating the mainland to support and participate in illegal organizations, playing a role in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in the mainland, and planning and assisting wanted counter-revolutionary rioters to flee abroad. Their subversive activities go against the wishes and interests of the entire Chinese people and ultimately harm the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.

The establishment and consolidation of the socialist system on Chinese soil reflect the objective laws of modern Chinese society. The practice of the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China has proven that it is socialism that has made this 5,000-year-old civilization rejuvenate, transforming an impoverished and backward old China into a thriving and prosperous new China. Today, socialist China stands independently in the East, playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. It is socialism that has made the Chinese people stand up and no longer suffer the humiliation and bullying of imperialists and colonialists. All overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau can deeply feel this from their personal experiences. Only the prosperity and strength of the socialist motherland can ensure the stability and prosperity of capitalist Hong Kong. We do not require the people of Hong Kong to accept the socialist system. But we believe that all patriots who support the cause of national reunification, uphold the dignity of the Chinese nation, and hope for the prosperity and development of the motherland will understand the choice of the 1.1 billion people of the mainland to firmly walk the socialist path.

In implementing the spirit of "One Country, Two Systems," Hong Kong and the mainland should also benefit each other economically. In terms of economic development and social prosperity, the mainland and Hong Kong have broad common interests and cooperation potential. Common interests bind the mainland and Hong Kong more closely. On one hand, the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong rely on the support of the motherland. Without the mainland continuously providing Hong Kong with abundant and inexpensive natural resources, labor resources, food, fresh water, and daily necessities, Hong Kong's economy would not be able to maintain long-term prosperity and development. Especially with Hong Kong backed by the mainland, it is the gateway for various countries to enter China. With the mainland's reform and opening-up policy, various construction projects and external economic ties are developing, and Hong Kong has benefited greatly from the economic activities between the mainland and various countries, significantly promoting Hong Kong's economic prosperity. On the other hand, the mainland's reform, opening-up, and construction need Hong Kong as a window and bridge for external relations, continuously expanding the export of raw materials and products and introducing funds, technology, and advanced management experience. It is this economic relationship of mutual prosperity and decline that requires us to leverage each other's strengths, benefit each other, and develop together when handling the economic relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong.

The practice of the past five years since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration tells us that due to the administration of Hong Kong during the transitional period being the responsibility of the British government, the relationship between China and the UK is directly and importantly related to the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, over the past five years, the Chinese and British sides have maintained friendly cooperation in implementing the Joint Declaration, resolving many issues, and ensuring the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong society, which shows that China and the UK have common interests in the Hong Kong issue. This spring and summer, the Chinese government suppressed a counter-revolutionary riot aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, which is purely an internal affair of China. We have not harmed anyone, nor do we wish to be harmed. Currently, Sino-British relations are in an abnormal state, which is not the responsibility of the Chinese side and is not what the Chinese side wants to see. China is a country of propriety, advocating reciprocity. In the Hong Kong issue, we also advocate for mutual respect and understanding. If someone tries to take advantage of the situation and exert pressure on us, the Chinese people will not fall for it. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that our policy of reform and opening-up will not change, and the policy of "One Country, Two Systems" and the policy toward Hong Kong will not change. We will always faithfully uphold the Sino-British Joint Declaration, regardless of the circumstances, we will not retreat from the Joint Declaration. China and the UK should maintain and develop good cooperative relations and ensure a smooth transition for Hong Kong. During the transitional period, any instability in Hong Kong is not in the interests of both China and the UK. We hope that the British side will adopt a wise and realistic attitude and return to the correct track of friendly cooperation to implement the Joint Declaration.

People often talk about the future and confidence of Hong Kong. We have always believed that the basic conditions for Hong Kong to maintain stability and prosperity, such as its unique natural geographical environment, relatively stable social situation, free and open economic system and policies, the hardworking and intelligent 5 million Hong Kong people, the economic ties and transshipment trade advantages between the mainland and Hong Kong, and the "One Country, Two Systems" and a series of special policies adopted by China to resolve the Hong Kong issue, all still exist or will not undergo fundamental changes. If we add the continued friendly cooperation between China and the UK in implementing the Joint Declaration and the maintenance and development of a relationship of mutual respect and mutual benefit between Hong Kong and the mainland, Hong Kong will continue to maintain strong vitality, and the future of Hong Kong will definitely be bright.

    切实执行“一国两制”的方针政策
    ——中英联合声明签署五周年寄语香港同胞
    郭刚
    5年前的今天，中英两国政府在北京正式签署了关于香港问题的联合声明，确认了我国将在1997年7月1日对香港恢复行使主权。这样，历史上遗留下来的香港问题获得了圆满的解决，中国人民蒙受了100多年的民族耻辱得以洗雪。旧中国历届政府都没有办成的事情，终于由中国共产党领导下的中华人民共和国政府完成了。这一具有历史意义的事件，是新中国外交工作的重大成就，是实现祖国统一大业的重要步骤。包括香港同胞在内的全中国人民都为此而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    香港问题的解决，消除了中英之间存在的历史阴影，使两国关系处于历史上的最好时期。几年来，我国政府为贯彻执行联合声明同英方进行了友好合作，作出了巨大的努力。中英联合联络小组和中英土地委员会的工作卓有成效。经过磋商，已经完成了与香港居民切身利益相关的全部香港旅行和身份证件过渡性安排的审议工作，解决了香港在1997年后以“中国香港”的名义单独参加关税及贸易总协定的问题，还就1997年后香港继续参加亚洲开发银行、国际货币基金组织、国际复兴开发银行、万国邮政联盟、国际电讯联盟、国际海事组织等国际组织的活动或保持在其中的地位问题达成了多项协议并作出许多实际安排，在香港法律本地化、香港民航协定、香港与有关国家移交逃犯安排以及土地契约的过渡性安排等问题上，也取得了积极的进展。在中英联合声明签署后不久，全国人大就决定成立香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会，以便把载入联合声明的我国政府对香港的基本方针政策用法律的形式规定下来。经过4年多内地与香港起草委员的共同努力，已先后公布了基本法（草案）征求意见稿和基本法
  （草案），并在香港和内地进行了两次广泛的征询意见工作。目前，起草委员会正在紧张地进行基本法的最后修改工作，明年3月将提交全国人大七届三次会议审议、通过并颁布。
    在中英双方和香港同胞的共同努力下，几年来香港的形势总的说是好的。经济呈现繁荣的景象，社会保持着稳定的局面，广大市民安居乐业，为使香港更加富有活力而辛勤工作。事实证明而且还将继续证明，中国政府始终不渝地信守中英联合声明，认真履行我们在这一庄严的国际协议中所承担的各项义务。
    载入中英联合声明的我国政府对香港的基本方针政策，是根据“一国两制”的科学构想制定的。党的十一届三中全会，恢复了马克思主义的实事求是的思想路线。本着尊重历史、尊重现实的态度，邓小平同志集中党中央的集体智慧，创造性地提出“一国两制”构想作为实现祖国统一的基本国策。就香港而言，“一国两制”构想及据此制定的解决香港问题的一系列特殊政策，是从香港的实际出发，充分考虑了香港的历史和现状的，它既维护了国家主权，又能保证香港继续稳定繁荣，符合包括香港同胞在内的全中国人民的根本利益和共同愿望，也照顾了其他方面的利益，合情合理，切实可行，因而受到海内外同胞的真心拥护和国际舆论的广泛赞誉。
    香港与祖国内地休戚与共，息息相关。切实执行“一国两制”的方针和政策，求“一国”之同，存“两制”之异，才能正确处理香港与内地的关系，这是保持香港长期稳定繁荣的一个基本条件。过渡时期是如此，1997年之后更是如此。
      “一国两制”的核心是国家的统一。如果离开了祖国统一，离开了我国对香港恢复行使主权，一切问题都无从谈起。“一国两制”的方针政策明确规定，未来的香港特别行政区是中华人民共和国的一个地方行政区域，直接受中央人民政府管辖。中央人民政府与香港特别行政区的关系是中央与地方的关系。香港特别行政区可以享有高度的自治权，但这个高度自治权是中央授予的，只能在统一的中华人民共和国的国家主权之下实行，绝不意味着香港带有任何独立或半独立的政治实体的性质。因此，贯彻“一国两制”的方针政策，首先必须维护国家的主权，维护中华民族的统一，反对任何阻挠中国对香港恢复行使主权的图谋。
    有人主张将香港与祖国内地“隔离”、“绝缘”，更有甚者，主张在香港与内地之间安装“防盗锁”，把“钥匙”交给香港人。这种主张完全无视我国主权的不可分割性，它并不是为了实现
  “一国两制”条件下的高度自治，而是要把“一国两制”变成
  “两国两制”，把香港搞成一个独立的政治实体，使香港永远脱离祖国的母体。谁都明白，香港过去没有、今后也不可能具备从祖国大陆脱离开去实行独立的条件。至于在“一国两制”条件下中央与香港特别行政区的权力划分问题，会由基本法加以规定。1997年后，中央会尊重香港的高度自治，不需要也不会去干预香港的具体事务，但中央保持某些作为一个国家中央政府所不可缺少的权力是必要的。这是维护统一的国家利益的基本保证。如果中央把什么权力都放弃了，就可能会在香港发生一些危害国家根本利益同时也损害香港本身利益的混乱。因此，保持中央某些必要的权力对国家对香港有利而无害。
    还有人基于所谓“民主拒共”的考虑，主张在香港政治体制的发展问题上要“加速民主进程”，主张香港全面直接选举立法机关的时间比基本法（草案）设想的“要大大提前”，并强调这是港人的意愿，试图造成既成事实迫使中国政府就范。我们不同意这种做法。中国政府多次重申，我们赞成香港的政制实行民主化，但必须符合“一国两制”的精神，必须循序渐进，照顾到各阶层的均衡参与，与基本法的规定衔接，以利于香港的稳定繁荣。如果说到民意，不能只听少数貌似为公众谋利益、实质抱着各种各样目的的人意愿，还要听香港“沉默”的多数的意愿；不仅听港人的民意，还要听全中国人民的民意。现在有人抛弃了各方曾经达成谅解的“循序渐进”原则和“与基本法衔接”原则，又一次打出“民意”牌来要求加快政制民主化的步伐，这就不能不使人怀疑，他们的目的是以“民主”为幌子，在香港建立1997年后与中央相对抗的政权模式，损害中国的主权。这是我们坚决不能答应的。
    当前一个值得注意的动向是，有人正在力图使香港问题国际化。中国政府一贯主张保持香港作为国际金融和贸易中心的地位，继续发展香港与世界其他国家和地区的经济关系，因为这样有利于香港的稳定和繁荣。但是，继续发挥香港作为国际金融和贸易中心的作用，与把香港问题国际化是截然不同的两回事。鼓吹香港问题国际化的人，并不是从香港经济发展的需要出发，而是企图造成国际势力逐步从政治上插手香港事务的局面，实质上是要纠集国际反共反华势力，干扰中国对香港恢复行使主权。众所周知，香港自古以来就是中国的领土，收回香港本来是中国主权范围内的事，考虑到香港的历史和现实情况，考虑到新中国成立后中英两国在和平共处五项原则基础上有着良好的关系，经过认真谈判，中英之间就解决香港问题达成了双边协议。1997年以前的过渡时期内，贯彻执行中英联合声明完全是中英两国政府的事情，任何其他国家或国际组织都无权干涉。1997年之后，香港将回到祖国的怀抱，成为中华人民共和国的一个特别行政区，绝不能把它搞成“国际共管”的地区。香港作为国际性城市，其他国家在香港会有经济利益。我们用“一国两制”构想解决香港问题，也注意到了照顾其他国家在香港的经济利益这一因素。但是，外国在香港的经济利益，要由香港基本法及有关的香港法律来保护，而不允许外国从政治上干预香港事务。所谓“别的国家在香港有经济利益，自然在香港的未来安排上有政治利益，因而要从政治上参与香港事务”的说法，是霸权主义和强权政治的理论。在20世纪80年代，在中国人民已经站立起来的今天，这种理论是根本行不通的。
    贯彻“一国两制”的精神，内地与香港的人应该互相尊重，和睦相处，彼此尊重对方的社会制度和生活方式，不要把自己的政治观点和意识形态强加给对方。也就是说，你搞你的资本主义，我搞我的社会主义，井水不犯河水，河水不犯井水。我们既反对损害统一的国家主权，把“一国两制”变成“两国两制”，也不赞成用一种制度吃掉另一种制度，把“一国两制”变成“一国一制”。我国领导人一再郑重声明，中央人民政府至少50年不会改变香港的资本主义制度，不会把社会主义的制度和政策推行到香港去。我们希望香港有些人也不要干预或企图改变内地的社会主义制度，不要把资本主义的一套输入内地。
    香港同胞作为中国公民的一部分，毫无疑问依法享有参与管理国家事务的权利。我们欢迎香港同胞关心和参与国家的事情，欢迎香港同胞对祖国内地的工作提出意见和建议。但是，香港同胞在参与管理国家事务的时候，要尊重内地的社会主义制度，遵守国家的宪法和法律。目前香港居民依法享有言论自由和新闻自由。根据香港基本法（草案）的规定，1997年后香港居民仍将继续享有这些自由。在过渡时期和香港回归祖国之后，香港同胞的言论、行动固然要受香港法律的规范，同时作为中国公民在参与国家事务的时候，也必须接受国家宪法和有关法律的规范。香港同胞向中央人民政府提出意见，应通过合法的途径，采取合法的方式，比如通过人大代表、政协委员或上书上访等渠道。如果不是这样，采用不正当的手段来表达自己的观点，那就难免事与愿违，反而有损于两地之间的和睦相处。不仅如此，内地人民和香港同胞是一家人，处理彼此之间的关系，既要讲合法，还要讲情理。要考虑两地在政治、经济、社会各个方面根本制度的不同以及意识形态和价值观念的差异，求同存异，互相体谅。如果动辄以自己的一套强加给对方，做些有伤感情的事，于国家有害，于自己无益。因此，我们希望内地与香港都以和睦相处为重，为“一国两制”的顺利实施营造一种良好的气氛。
    现在的问题是，确实有那么极少数人利用香港作为颠覆中央人民政府、颠覆内地社会主义制度的基地。他们公然标榜以推翻中央政府，把西方的所谓“民主”、“自由”、“人权”推行到内地为宗旨。他们恶毒攻击和诽谤我国领导人，制造重重谣言来煽起反对共产党、反对社会主义的狂热情绪，甚至渗入内地支持和参与非法组织的活动，在内地的动乱和反革命暴乱中起了推波助澜的作用，并且策划和接应被中央政府通缉的反革命暴乱分子偷渡外逃。他们的种种颠覆活动，违背了全国人民的愿望和利益，结果也危害了香港的稳定繁荣。
    社会主义制度在中国大地上的确立和巩固，体现了中国现代社会运动的客观规律。中华人民共和国成立40年来的实践证明，是社会主义使我们这个五千年文明古国重新焕发出蓬勃生机，从一个贫穷落后的旧中国变成了初步繁荣昌盛的新中国。今天，社会主义中国独立自主地巍然屹立在世界的东方，在国际事务中发挥着越来越重要的作用。是社会主义使中国人站立起来，再不受帝国主义者、殖民主义者的侮辱和欺凌。所有海外侨胞和港澳同胞从自己的亲身经历中可以深刻地感受到这一点。只有社会主义祖国的昌盛富强，才能有资本主义香港的稳定繁荣。我们不要求香港同胞都接受社会主义制度。但我们相信，凡是拥护祖国统一事业、维护中华民族尊严、期望祖国兴旺发达的爱国者，一定可以理解内地11亿人民坚定不移走社会主义道路的选择。
    贯彻“一国两制”精神，香港与内地在经济上还应该互惠互利。因为在发展经济、促进社会繁荣方面，内地和香港有着广泛的共同利益和合作余地。共同的利益把内地与香港越来越紧密地联结在一起。一方面，香港的繁荣稳定有赖于祖国的支持。假如没有内地一直向香港提供丰富而廉价的自然资源、劳动力资源、食品、淡水和生活必需品，香港的经济就不可能长期保持繁荣和发展。特别是香港背靠祖国大陆，是世界各国进入中国的门户。随着内地实行改革开放政策，各项建设事业和对外经济联系日益发展，香港在内地与世界各国的经济活动中获益不少，极大地推动了香港经济的繁荣。另一方面，内地的改革、开放和建设，需要香港这样一个对外联系的窗口和桥梁，通过香港不断扩大原材料和产品的出口贸易，引进资金、技术和先进的管理经验。正是这种经济上的盛衰与共的关系，要求我们在处理内地与香港之间的经济关系时，要发挥各自优势，互惠互利，共同发展。
    中英联合声明签署五年来的实践告诉我们：由于过渡时期香港的行政管理由英国政府负责，因而中英关系是否良好，对香港与内地的关系有着直接和重要的影响。正如本文开始时说的，五年来中英双方在贯彻联合声明上继续保持了友好合作，解决了不少问题，保证了香港社会的稳定繁荣，这表明中英两国在香港问题上有着共同的利益。今年春夏之交，中国政府平息了一场旨在推翻共产党领导和社会主义制度的反革命暴乱，这完全是中国的内政。我们完全没有伤害别人，也不愿别人伤害我们。目前中英关系处于不正常状态，责任不在中方，也不是中方所愿意看到的。中国是礼义之邦，讲究礼尚往来，你敬我一尺，我敬你一丈。在香港问题上我们也是主张有商有量，互谅互让。如果认为有可乘之机，对我施加压力，中国人民是不吃这一套的。中国政府多次重申，我国改革、开放的政策不变，“一国两制”以及对香港的方针政策不变，我们将始终不渝地信守中英联合声明，不管发生什么情况，我们决不从联合声明上后退。中英两国应该保持和发展良好的合作关系，保证香港有一个平稳的过渡。在过渡时期，香港发生任何不安定都不符合中英双方的利益。我们希望英国方面采取明智现实的态度，重新回到为贯彻联合声明进行友好合作的正确轨道上来。
    人们常常说到香港的前途和信心问题，我们始终认为，香港赖以保持稳定繁荣的基本条件，诸如得天独厚的自然地理环境、相对稳定的社会局面、自由开放的经济制度和政策、勤劳智慧的500多万香港同胞、内地与香港的经济联系和转口贸易优势，以及我国解决香港问题所采取的“一国两制”和一系列特殊政策等，都仍然存在或不会发生根本变化；如果加上中英在贯彻联合声明上继续友好合作，香港与内地保持和发展互相尊重、互惠互利的关系，香港必将继续保持强大的活力，香港的前途一定是光明的。
