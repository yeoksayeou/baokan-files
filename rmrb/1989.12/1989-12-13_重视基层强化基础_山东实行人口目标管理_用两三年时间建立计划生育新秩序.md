This year, Shandong, a province with a large population, has taken "strengthening the grassroots, building the foundation, focusing on lagging areas, promoting balance, promoting reform, and raising standards" as the guiding ideology for family planning. The province aims to bring family planning work at the grassroots level into a regular, institutionalized, standardized, and scientific track within two to three years.

Over the past year, Shandong Province has focused on the following key areas to strengthen the grassroots foundation:

	— Strengthening leadership and building a workforce to establish a working network. Statistics show that currently, the province has 19,000 professional family planning personnel at the township level, with an average of 7-8 people per township. 80% of the townships have established service stations that provide various services such as propaganda, technology, and contraceptives. Villages also have full-time family planning personnel. The number of members in the provincial family planning association has reached over 2 million. Grassroots organizations such as workers, youth, women, militia, party members, association members, and women's groups are gradually expanding.

	— Establishing systems and management, implementing various responsibility systems. The province, city, county, township, and village levels have all implemented population target management. Through signing population target responsibility contracts at each level, administrative heads are held responsible, and the implementation situation is used as an important basis for performance evaluation. Tens of thousands of cadres dispatched to villages and enterprises by various levels also regard family planning as an important task.

	— Emphasizing propaganda and education, providing various services, and incorporating family planning into the overall plan for material and spiritual civilization. The province has carried out the "Three Main" (propaganda and education as the main focus, contraception and sterilization as the main focus, and routine work as the main focus) civilized unit evaluation activities.

	— Coordinating policies, comprehensive management, and establishing a social security system. Currently, 90% of the townships have established elderly care homes. At the same time, various social security projects beneficial to single-child families, families with two daughters, and family planning personnel, such as insurance, savings, and old-age care, are universally promoted, driving the development of family planning.

	— Enforcing discipline and rule of law, establishing a new order of family planning. Public security and judicial departments perform their duties to protect family planning workers from interference while performing their duties. Various levels of party committees and disciplinary committees pay special attention to the handling of cadres and party members who violate family planning policies.

	— Focusing on solving practical problems for the grassroots. The province and various cities have allocated 3,470 special contract labor quotas to recruit long-term family planning temporary personnel. The provincial financial department has increased funding annually to support the construction of family planning service stations. Family planning personnel at various levels of cities, counties, and townships have all received position allowances. Many places have also solved labor protection items such as cotton clothes, cotton shoes, raincoats, rain boots, and bicycles for grassroots workers.

These measures have raised the level of family planning work in Shandong, and the population growth rate has significantly decreased compared to previous years.

    重视基层强化基础
    山东实行人口目标管理
    用两三年时间建立计划生育新秩序
    据新华社济南12月11日电　今年以来，人口大省山东把“抓基础、打基础、抓后进、促平衡，抓改革、上水平”作为计划生育的指导思想，打算用2—3年，使全省计划生育基层工作逐步纳入经常化、制度化、规范化、科学化轨道。
    近一年来，山东省在强化基层基础方面主要抓了以下几项工作：
    ——抓班子，抓队伍，建好工作网络。据统计，现在，全省乡镇一级计划生育专业人员已达1.9万多人，平均每个乡镇7—8人。80％的乡镇已建有服务站，开展宣传、技术、药具等各种服务。村一级也配齐计划生育专职人员。全省计划生育协会会员发展到200万人以上。基层工、青、妇、民兵、党员联系户、协会会员联系户、育龄妇女小组等组织逐步壮大。
    ——抓制度，抓管理，建立各种责任制。省、市地、县、乡、村五级全部实行了人口目标管理，通过层层签订人口目标责任书，实行行政首长负责制，并把执行情况作为考核政绩的重要依据。各级下派包村包企业的数万名干部，也都把抓计划生育作为一项重要任务。
    ——抓宣传教育，抓各种服务，把计划生育纳入社会主义物质文明和精神文明总体规划。全省开展了计划生育“三为主”（宣传教育为主、避孕节育为主、经常工作为主）文明单位达标活动。
    ——抓政策配套，抓综合治理，建立社会保障体系。目前，全省90％的乡镇已建有敬老院。同时普遍开展有利于独生子女家庭、双女户和计划生育人员的保险、储蓄、养老等社会保障事业，推动了计划生育的开展。
    ——抓执行纪律和依法治理，建立计划生育新秩序。公安司法部门履行职责，保护计划生育工作人员正常执行公务，各级党委、纪委特别重视对干部、党员违反计划生育政策的处理。
    ——注重为基层解决实际问题。省和各市地拨出3470名专项合同制工人指标用于招收长期在基层工作的计划生育临时人员。省财政部门逐年增拨经费，补助计划生育服务站的建设。各市地、县、乡计划生育工作人员全部实行了岗位津贴。不少地方还为基层工作人员解决了棉衣、棉鞋、雨衣、雨靴、自行车等劳保用品。
    这些措施，使山东计生工作再上新水平，人口增长率比往年明显降低。
