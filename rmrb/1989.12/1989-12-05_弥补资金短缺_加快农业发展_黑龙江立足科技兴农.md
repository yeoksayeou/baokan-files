The Songnen and Sanjiang plains, though now covered in a thousand miles of ice and snow, are quiet and serene. However, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and all the provincial department-level cadres are heatedly discussing the "Science and Technology for Agriculture" plan, as if they have brought spring forward.

Heilongjiang is vast and sparsely populated, with many uncultivated lands in the Sanjiang Plain that can be developed. However, land reclamation requires significant investment. In the face of financial shortages, the most practical and urgent task is to rely on science and technology to accelerate agricultural development. Based on repeated investigations and deliberations, Heilongjiang Province has formulated the "Science and Technology for Agriculture" plan. The plan stipulates:

	— To combine traditional agricultural technology with modern agricultural technology according to local conditions. Based on the province's characteristics, select suitable varieties, plant early, improve cultivation methods, promote deep plowing with machinery, and increase the use of farmyard manure.

	— To carry out large-scale high-yield trials. The trial area will be 35 million mu (approximately 2333 square kilometers), aiming to achieve half of the total production from one-third of the cultivated land. Agricultural science and technology personnel will go to the front lines, implement scientific and technological group contracting, and combine leaders, scientific and technological personnel, and farmers. They will also match technology, materials, and funds, and provide various preferential policies.

	— To comprehensively manage cultivated land, grasslands, and afforestation, and improve low-yield fields. Low-lying lands will be converted into paddy fields (increasing the paddy field area by 10 million mu each year), and slopes will be planted with drought-resistant crops. In the Sanjiang Plain alone, within two years, 42 million mu of low-yield fields will be improved, 5.2 million mu of grasslands will be improved, 9.2 million mu of forests will be planted, and large-scale river management and reservoir construction will be carried out.

	— To popularize agricultural technology education and improve farmers' scientific farming skills. Next year, 700,000 rural youth will receive agricultural technology training, and within two years, 100,000 rural youth will be basically literate. This winter and next spring, the "Science and Technology Winter" campaign will be launched in rural areas, ensuring that every household has at least one labor force member who masters the applicable technology to be promoted next year. Agricultural education content will also be increased in primary and secondary schools.

To implement the above "Science and Technology for Agriculture" strategy, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have organized various industries to formulate plans to support agriculture and launched the "Share the Prosperity and Decline of Agriculture, Contribute to Agriculture" campaign. They have also stipulated that the province, prefecture, city, and county levels must have one secretary in charge of agriculture. The main criteria for evaluating the performance of leading cadres will be whether they have increased the effective supply of grain and major agricultural products and whether they have increased the momentum of agricultural production.

### 弥补资金短缺  加快农业发展  黑龙江立足科技兴农

    弥补资金短缺  加快农业发展
    黑龙江立足科技兴农
    本报哈尔滨电　记者武培真报道：松嫩、三江平原，虽已进入千里冰封、白雪皑皑、一片寂静时期，而黑龙江省委和全省厅局级干部们对“科技兴农”的方案的讨论却是热火朝天，像是把春天提前唤来。
    黑龙江地广人稀，可在三江平原开发较多荒地。但开荒需要较大投资，在资金短缺的情况下，最现实和急需的是依靠科学技术加快农业发展。黑龙江省在反复调查研究酝酿的基础上，作出了“科技兴农”方案。这个方案规定：
    ——因地制宜把传统农业技术和现代农业技术结合起来。根据本省省情，选择适用良种，适时早播，改进栽培办法，推广机械深耕和大量增加农家肥。
    ——大面积开展高产攻关。攻关面积为3500万亩，力争1／3的耕地实现1／2的总产。农业科技人员到第一线主战场，实行科技集团承包和领导、科技人员、农民三结合及技术、物资、资金相配套，并辅之于各项优惠政策。
    ——实行耕地、草原、造林综合治理，改造低产田。低洼地改水稻田（每年扩大水稻面积100万亩），坡地多种耐旱作物。仅三江平原，两年内要改低产田420万亩，改良草场52万亩，造林92万亩，并大规模治理江河和兴修水库。
    ——普及农业技术教育，提高农民科学种田素质。明年要对全省70万在乡知识青年进行农业技术培训，两年内争取使10万农村青年基本脱盲。今冬明春，在农村开展“科技之冬”活动，使全省每个农户有一名劳力掌握明年要推广的适用技术。并在中小学加重农业教育内容。
    为实施上述“科技兴农”战略，省委、省府组织各行各业制定大力支农方案，开展“我与农业共兴衰，争为农业作贡献”活动。他们还规定，省、地、市、县都要设一名书记主管农业。并以是否增加了对粮食和主要农产品生产的有效供给，是否增加了农业生产后劲，作为考核领导班子政绩的主要标准。
