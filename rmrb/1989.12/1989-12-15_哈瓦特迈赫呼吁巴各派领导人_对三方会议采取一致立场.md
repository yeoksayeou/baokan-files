	Hawatmeh Calls on Palestinian Leaders to Adopt a Unified Stance on the Three-Party Conference

	Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, December 13th - According to today's report by Kuwait's "News," the General Secretary of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Hawatmeh, has called on Palestinian leaders to adopt a stance consistent with the Palestinian peace initiative on the issue of the Middle East peace process.

	Hawatmeh said in an interview with the newspaper's reporter that Palestinian leaders of various factions must adopt a coordinated and unified stance on the upcoming three-party foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Washington next month.

	He said that the three-party foreign ministers' meeting will discuss the composition of the Palestinian delegation to participate in the proposed Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. This is an attempt to impose a "three-party guardianship" over the Palestinian people and their sole legitimate representative, the PLO.

	He said that the PLO leadership will hold a meeting in the near future to discuss the recent developments in the Palestinian issue and to formulate a stance consistent with the Palestinian peace proposal and the decision made by the PLO Central Committee in Baghdad in October.

	The Baghdad decision emphasizes that the PLO has the right to organize delegations both inside and outside the occupied territories to participate in the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue under the supervision of the United Nations, and to use this as the first step towards convening an international conference for Middle East peace.

    哈瓦特迈赫呼吁巴各派领导人
    对三方会议采取一致立场
    新华社科威特12月13日电  据科威特《新闻报》今天报道，解放巴勒斯坦民主阵线总书记哈瓦特迈赫呼吁巴勒斯坦领导人在中东和平进程问题上，采取与巴勒斯坦和平倡议一致的立场。
    哈瓦特迈赫在接受该报记者采访时说，巴勒斯坦各派领导人必须对下月在华盛顿举行的埃、美、以3国外长会议采取协调一致的立场。
    他说，3国外长会议将讨论参加拟议中的巴以对话的巴勒斯坦代表团组成问题，这是企图在巴勒斯坦人民及其唯一合法代表巴解组织头上，实行
  “3方监护制度”。
    他说，巴解组织领导人将在近日内举行会议，讨论巴勒斯坦问题的最近形势发展，并制订同巴勒斯坦和平建议与巴解组织中央委员会10月在巴格达通过的决议一致的立场。
    巴格达决议强调，巴解组织有权在被占领土内外组织代表团，参加由联合国监督的巴以对话，并以此作为召开中东和平国际会议的第一步。
