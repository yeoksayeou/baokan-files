The eleventh session of the second executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions concluded in Beijing today. The meeting approved the work report delivered by Ni Zhifu on behalf of the executive committee, elected new vice-chairpersons, and selected new first secretary and secretaries of the secretariat.

Ni Zhifu, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said at the closing meeting that trade unions must consciously accept the leadership of the Party, but at the same time, they must, in accordance with their nature and characteristics as mass organizations, independently and autonomously carry out work in line with laws and regulations, faithfully perform their social functions, maintain close ties with the workers, and win the trust of the broad masses of workers.

When discussing the temporary difficulties currently faced by enterprises, Ni Zhifu urged all levels of trade unions to closely monitor the development trends, timely grasp the situation, and do everything possible to ensure the basic livelihood of workers.

Ni Zhifu pointed out that maintaining the continuous stability of the domestic political situation and ensuring the stable and coordinated development of the national economy are the two major tasks for next year. The work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions next year will revolve around these two tasks.
