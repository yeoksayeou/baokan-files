After eight years of exile, Nicaraguan former Deputy Minister of Defense and one of the leaders of the anti-government armed forces, Eden Pastora, returned to Managua on the 3rd to participate in the elections scheduled for next February. Pastora is a former leader of the Nicaraguan Sandinista National Liberation Front. In 1978, he led an attack on the National Palace during the Somoza regime, earning the nickname "Zero Commander." In July 1979, after the FSLN came to power, Pastora served as Deputy Minister of Defense. However, due to differing political views, he took up arms and engaged in guerrilla warfare against the government in 1981. Later, due to a lack of supplies and ammunition, he was forced to flee to Costa Rica.

    尼“零号”司令回国参加大选
    在经过八年的流亡生活之后，尼加拉瓜前国防部副部长、反政府武装领导人之一埃登·帕斯托拉三日返回马那瓜参加明年二月举行的大选。帕斯托拉是尼加拉瓜桑地诺民族解放阵线前领导人。一九七八年他曾领导攻打过当时索摩查政权国民宫的行动，以“零号”司令闻名于世。一九七九年七月，桑解阵取得政权后，帕斯托拉曾担任过国防部副部长，后因政见不同，于一九八一年上山打游击，从事反政府的武装斗争，后因弹尽粮绝而被迫流亡哥斯达黎加。
