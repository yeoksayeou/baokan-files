Xinhua News Agency, Laizhou, December 16th

    Laizhou's saline-alkali land produced 3.5 tons of sweet potatoes per mu this year. The report states that in Laizhou City, Shandong Province, 2,000 mu of sweet potatoes were planted on saline-alkali land using plastic film covering technology, yielding a total of over 7 million kilograms, with an average yield of 3.5 tons per mu. This is 1,500 kilograms more per mu than the yield on fertile soil.

    This piece of land is close to the coast and has seen little to no grain yield in recent years due to seawater intrusion. Since 1987, Laizhou City, in collaboration with relevant research institutions, has implemented this technology.

    莱州盐碱滩亩产红薯3吨半
    本报讯　山东省莱州市利用地膜覆盖技术，今年在盐碱滩上种植的2000亩红薯，获总产700多万公斤，平均亩产高达3吨半，比肥沃土壤种植的亩产还多1500多公斤。
    这片地靠近海岸，近年由于海水侵染，种粮颗粒无收。从1987年开始，莱州市在有关科研部门配合下，实施这项技术。（孙林经）
