Li Guixian, State Councilor and Governor of the People's Bank of China, said in an end-of-year interview with reporters that China's financial situation has eased this year, but many problems remain. Next year, financial work will continue to implement a tight monetary policy, controlling the total amount while making timely adjustments.

Li Guixian said that this year, due to the serious implementation of the State Council's rectification and adjustment policies by various regions and departments, the overheated economic growth has begun to cool down, and the growth of fixed asset investment and consumption funds has been controlled. Under these conditions, coupled with the hard work of the banking sector, the financial situation this year has been better than expected. This is mainly reflected in the normalization of currency withdrawal, effective control of bank lending scale, enhanced bank payment capacity, improved credit, and improved credit structure.

Li Guixian introduced that it is estimated that the total currency issuance this year will be significantly lower than last year. He said that the good currency withdrawal this year is mainly due to the relatively stable market prices, stable public psychology, and the bank's increase in deposit interest rates and the launch of savings business, which has increased the savings deposits of urban and rural residents. It is estimated that the total savings deposits this year will increase by about 120 billion yuan, an increase of 47 billion yuan over the same period last year.

Li Guixian said that this year, due to the implementation of the loan quota management method by the People's Bank, the momentum of rapid increase in bank loans in the first half of last year has been reversed, and the total loan scale can be controlled within the planned progress. Although the total loan scale this year is not much higher than last year, the bank has adjusted the credit structure, and the loans used to increase social effective supply have increased significantly. The bank has concentrated funds to support the production of large and medium-sized key enterprises, agricultural production and procurement, foreign trade imports and exports, and the funding needs of national key construction projects. He introduced that in the first 11 months, the increase in various loans, especially the increase in loans to industrial enterprises, particularly state-owned industrial enterprises, has been significant. By the end of November, a total of 54 billion yuan in loans had been increased, an increase of 24 billion yuan over the same period last year. Grain loans and foreign trade loans have also increased significantly. However, loans to township enterprises, circulation companies, and trust loans have all decreased to varying degrees.

The reporter asked: Although the new loans issued by the bank this year are not small, why do enterprises still feel that funds are very tight? Li Guixian said that the bank's loan balance is expected to increase by 13.85% compared to the beginning of the year. This growth rate is not low compared to the growth rate of industrial production and national income this year, but the fact that funds are becoming tighter on all sides is also true. Li Guixian believes that this is a problem that has accumulated over the years. The main reason is that the economy has maintained high-speed growth for several years, and the scale of construction has continued to expand, resulting in excessive demand for funds; secondly, the efficiency of enterprise fund use is poor, occupying and using too much, and the phenomenon of misappropriation is serious.

Li Guixian said that another reason for the increasing tightness of funds is that the proportion of enterprises' own working capital has been decreasing in recent years. The proportion of budgetary state-owned enterprises' own working capital in the total working capital has dropped from 39.5% in 1983 to 18% last year. The additional funds needed by enterprises due to price increases for purchasing raw materials and other items all have to be solved through bank loans. Li Guixian said that the amount of bank loans is restricted by the source of funds. The bank is like a reservoir, with various deposits flowing in from all directions and flowing out in the form of loans to various places. Li Guixian said that currently, the bank's sources of funds are decreasing, while the demand for funds is increasing. Faced with this situation, if loans are increased, the only way out is to increase currency issuance, but this will further exacerbate inflation.

When talking about next year's financial work and financial policies, Li Guixian pointed out that the gradual improvement of currency and credit this year shows that the State Council's "double-tight" policy has achieved initial results. However, compared to the serious shortage of national energy, raw material supply, and bank funding sources, and the requirement to control inflation, the tightening is still far from the target, and the amount of currency in circulation is still excessive. The task of suppressing and eliminating inflation is still very arduous. Therefore, Li Guixian emphasized that next year, the tightening of monetary policy will continue; in terms of currency and credit, the policy of controlling the total amount, adjusting the structure, ensuring key areas, compressing general areas, and making timely adjustments will continue to be implemented.

He emphasized that next year, the bank will prioritize supporting agriculture. The bank will not only fully support agricultural production but will also support the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, the production of agricultural production materials, the processing of agricultural and sideline products, and the circulation sector in rural areas as key areas. For large and medium-sized key enterprises, more funds will be invested.

Li Guixian revealed that in the first half of next year, the proportion of bank loans in the annual loan scale will be higher than this year.

Li Guixian said that next year, the following points will be emphasized in financial work: First, every effort will be made to increase the sources of funds; second, efforts will be made to tap the potential of funds, urging enterprises to clear warehouses and utilize stored materials, and at the same time, to collect personal arrears of public funds and bank loans; third, the situation of enterprises opening accounts in multiple financial institutions will be cleaned up, and unreasonable business crossings between specialized banks will be canceled; fourth, the activation of the financial market will continue, and the trial of stock and bond markets will also continue to be improved.

Li Guixian finally called on all departments and localities to create more conditions for enterprises and help enterprises increase their own working capital.

    李贵鲜年终接受记者采访称
    我国金融形势有所缓和
    明年继续贯彻执行紧缩银根方针
    新华社北京12月28日电（记者丁坚铭）国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜年终在接受记者采访时说，1989年，我国金融形势有所缓和，但金融面临的问题依然很多。明年金融工作要继续贯彻执行银根紧缩方针，在控制总量的前提下，搞好适时调节。
    李贵鲜说，今年以来由于各地区、各部门认真贯彻国务院治理整顿方针，过热的经济增长开始降温，固定资产投资和消费基金增长得到控制。在这种大气候条件下，再加上银行部门的辛勤努力，因此，今年的金融形势比预料的要好。主要表现在，货币回笼趋于正常，银行贷款规模得到有效控制，银行支付能力增强，信誉提高，信贷结构也有所改善。
    李贵鲜介绍说，预计今年全年货币投放将明显低于去年。他说，今年货币回笼较好主要是由于市场物价相对平稳，群众心理安定，加上银行提高存款利率和开展保值储蓄业务，使城乡居民的储蓄存款增加较多。预计全年储蓄存款可增加1200亿元左右，比去年同期多增加470亿元。
    李贵鲜说，今年由于人民银行采取了贷款限额管理办法，扭转了去年银行贷款上半年增加过猛的势头，全年贷款规模可控制在计划进度之内。今年贷款规模与去年相比，虽然增加不多，但银行通过调整信贷结构，用于增加社会有效供给方面的贷款却增加较多，银行集中资金重点支持了大中型骨干企业生产、农业生产与收购、外贸进出口及国家重点建设的资金需要。他介绍说，在头11个月的各项贷款增加额中，工业企业特别是国营工业企业贷款增加额增加较多，到11月末共增加贷款540亿元，比去年同期多增加240亿元，粮食贷款和外贸贷款也增加较多。而乡镇企业、流通性公司及信托贷款都有不同程度的减少。
    记者提问：今年银行新增贷款并不少，企业为什么却仍然感到资金十分紧张？李贵鲜说，今年银行贷款余额预计比年初增长13.85％，这一增长幅度与今年工业生产总值和国民生产总值增长速度相比并不算低，但各方面资金越来越紧张却也是事实。李贵鲜认为，这是多年积累下来的问题，最主要的是近几年经济持续高速增长，基建规模不断膨胀，造成了对资金的过旺需求；其次是企业资金运用效益较差，占压占用过多、挪用现象严重。
    李贵鲜说，造成资金越来越紧张的原因还有一个是近几年企业自有流动资金的比例直线下降，预算内国营企业自有流动资金占全部流动资金的比例，已由1983年的39.5％下降到了去年的18％。企业因购进原材料等涨价需要多增加的资金，全要靠银行贷款来解决。李贵鲜说，银行贷款的多少要受到资金来源的限制，银行就像一座水库，各项存款从四面八方汇进来，又以贷款形式向各个方面泄出来。李贵鲜说，目前银行的资金来源渠道日趋减少，而资金需求却在不断增加，面对这种情况，如若再增加贷款，唯一的出路就是增加货币发行，但这会进一步加剧通货膨胀。
    在谈到明年的金融工作和金融方针时，李贵鲜指出，1989年货币、信贷逐步好转的情况表明，国务院确定的“双紧”方针已取得了初步成效。但相对于国家能源、原材料供应、银行资金来源严重不足的状况和治理通货膨胀的要求来说，紧缩还远未达到目标，流通中货币依然过多，抑制和消除通货膨胀的任务还十分艰巨。为此，李贵鲜强调，明年要继续紧缩银根；在货币信贷上要继续执行控制总量、调整结构、保证重点、压缩一般、适时调节的方针。
    他强调，明年银行要把支持农业放在第一位，银行不但要全力支持农业生产，而且对农副产品收购、农业生产资料的生产、农副产品加工及农村的流通领域也要作为重点来支持。对大中型骨干企业要增加资金投入。
    李贵鲜透露，明年上半年，银行贷款占全年贷款规模的比例会比今年有所提高。
    李贵鲜说，明年在金融工作中还要抓好以下几点：一是要尽全力增加资金来源；二是要下大力挖掘资金潜力，督促企业清仓利库、处理积压物资，同时要清收个人拖欠的公款和银行贷款；三是要清理企业在多家金融机构开户情况，取消专业银行之间不合理的业务交叉；四是要继续搞活金融市场，股票、债券市场也要继续进行试点，使之不断完善。
    李贵鲜最后呼吁各部门、各地方都要为企业多创造一些条件，帮助企业多增加一些自有流动资金。
