According to reports: In Yun County, Hubei Province, South Huahua Town, obtaining a marriage certificate costs over 100 yuan, divided into seven categories: pre-marital health check-up fee 16.2 yuan, birth insurance fee 20 yuan, child insurance for ages 0 to 7 40 yuan, maternal and infant compensation 30 yuan, marriage certificate processing fee 4 yuan, photography fee 2 yuan, and additional fees of 10 yuan and 5 yuan respectively for marrying outside the town or moving in from outside. The total comes to 122.20 yuan or 117.20 yuan. The per capita net income in Yunyang District last year was 276 yuan. This town has 77 young couples who cannot afford to "buy" a marriage certificate and are living together illegally. Some young men pat their fiancées on the shoulder and say, "Let's go! We don't need this piece of paper, as long as we both agree, it's fine." (See November 15, Hubei Daily)

It is indeed an expensive marriage certificate. Among the seven fees, not all are unnecessary (of course, necessary fees should also be as low as possible), but most are akin to plucking feathers from a passing goose. This kind of extortion is quite common. Originally, there were reports of roadblocks, power cuts, and water stoppages, now there is even extortion for issuing marriage certificates.

Marriage is a joyous occasion, and for most people, it happens only once in a lifetime. The bride and groom go to get their certificate with joy in their hearts, but they are met with seven outstretched hands demanding money, which is truly disheartening! Moreover, 100 yuan is a significant amount for farmers!

The characteristic of arbitrary fees is that they are demanded at critical moments, forcing you to pay even if you don't want to. Many critically ill patients, factories waiting for materials, and households needing heating have suffered from this. Marriage is also a critical moment; with a certificate, it is a legal marriage, without it, it is an illegal marriage. To make it legal, you have to pay, which is essentially using sacred laws to make money. Those who cannot or do not want to pay simply go ahead and break the law, which is no longer just a matter of collecting a few extra yuan, but has become a serious social issue. It not only makes people complain about the department that collects the fees but also makes them resent the Party and the government, affecting social stability.

Fees that should be collected must be collected. The current situation is that while there are arbitrary fees, necessary fees are not being collected. For example, those exposed big bosses and famous singers who evade taxes and act recklessly, with millions in their pockets, do not contribute a single cent; society also has some "hoodlums" who do not want to pay for their meals or accommodation. These people should have the fees that should be collected, collected in full and without hesitation. If not, engaging in extortion and arbitrary fees will only enrich the crooked and harm the law-abiding citizens.

    昂贵的结婚证
    李德民
    据报道：在湖北省郧县南化塘镇领一份结婚证要花一百多元，分7种：婚前体检费16.2元，生育保险费20元，入保儿童0至7岁保险金40元，母婴保偿金30元，结婚证工本费4元，照像费2元，在本镇以外联姻迁入、迁出，分别另收10元和5元，7项累计共122.20元或117.20元。郧阳地区去年农村人均纯收入是276元，这个镇有77对青年男女因“买”不起结婚证而非法同居，有的男青年拍着未婚妻的肩膀说：“走啊！这张纸咱不要了，只要我俩同意就行了。”（见11月15日湖北日报）
    真是昂贵的结婚证。在七项收费中，不是都不必要（当然必要的收费项目也要收费越少越好），但多数属于雁过拔毛。这种敲竹杠的做法，目前相当普遍。原来常听有什么拦路的，断电的，停水的，现在又出了个发结婚证的。
    结婚是件喜事，大多数人一辈子就那么一次，新郎、新娘喜气洋洋去领证，迎面却伸来七只要钱的手，实在扫兴！何况一百多元对农民是一笔大钱呀！
    乱收费，有一个特点，就是关键时刻伸手要，叫你不愿给也得给。不少生命垂危的患者、停工待料的工厂、急需供暖的住户……都吃过这种苦头。结婚也是个关键时刻，有证是合法婚姻，无证是非法婚姻，要想合法，就得掏钱，这简直是拿神圣的法律去赚钱了。有些掏不起钱或不愿掏钱的，干脆硬着头皮去违法，这就不单纯是多收几个钱的问题，已经酿成严重的社会问题了，它使人不仅抱怨乱收费的那个部门，而且会迁怒于党和政府，影响社会安定。
    该收的费当然要收。现在的情况是，一方面存在着乱收费现象，另一方面该收的又收不上来，比如对揭露出来的那些大老板、名歌星之类，他们偷税漏税，胡作非为，腰缠万贯，一毛不拔；社会上还有一些吃饭不想交饭钱、住店不想交店钱的“混混”，对这些人应当把该收的钱理直气壮地、一分不少地全部收上来。如果不是这样，搞敲竹杠，乱收费，那只能肥了歪门邪道的“小人”，苦了奉公守法的“百姓”。
