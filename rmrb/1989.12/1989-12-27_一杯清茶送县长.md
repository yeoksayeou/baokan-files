Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 12th.

On October 12th, higher authorities decided to transfer Zhang Xianxin, the deputy county magistrate of our county, to another region for his new post. The news spread, and the leaders and colleagues in the county government office were reluctant to part, their hearts warm and tingling.

How should we send off Deputy County Magistrate Zhang Xianxin as he embarks on his new journey? After seeking the opinions of the colleagues, the county leaders felt that having a feast would be too vulgar, and presenting a souvenir would be too shallow. The best way to send him off would be to have an open-hearted exchange of thoughts and summarize experiences. Therefore, the next day's county magistrate office meeting added an agenda item: a farewell meeting for Deputy County Magistrate Zhang. The county leaders who continued to serve bought melon seeds, fruits, and tea leaves with their own money. Everyone sipped tea and had heart-to-heart talks, discussing the changes in Xian County since Zhang Xianxin took office, and the increasingly better political and economic situation nationwide; from the victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, to the profound significance of Comrade Jiang Zemin's National Day speech. The more they talked, the warmer they felt, and the brighter their hearts became. The farewell meeting turned into a situation discussion meeting. After the meeting, some colleagues invited Zhang Xianxin to their homes, but he politely declined each invitation. Before leaving, Zhang Xianxin, who was a scholar, wrote a farewell letter of several hundred words, had it printed, and sent it along with government documents to each township and county-level unit. Everyone who read it praised it, saying, "This is great! It's better than visiting each place for more than ten days, saving on cars, oil, and time. It's a good move for building a clean government."

    一杯清茶送县长
    10月12日，上级决定调我县常务副县长张显忱到另一个地区任职。消息传来，县政府机关的领导和同志们依依不舍，心里热辣辣的。
    怎样欢送张副县长踏上新的征程呢？县领导征求了同志们的意见之后，觉得吃喝一顿太庸俗，送件纪念品也浮浅，最好的欢送是推心置腹地交流思想，总结经验。于是，次日的县长办公会议上增加了一项议程：送别张副县长座谈会。继续留任的县领导们自掏腰包买了瓜子、水果和茶叶。大家边喝茶边谈心，从张副县长任职期间遵化县的变化，谈到全国越来越好的政治经济形势；从平息反革命暴乱的胜利，谈到江泽民同志国庆讲话的深远意义，越谈越热乎，越谈心里越豁亮，欢送会变成了形势座谈会。会后，有的同志邀张副县长到家里作客，他一一拱手谢绝了。临行前，秀才出身的张显忱同志提笔写了一封几百字的告别信，印好后随政府文件送到各乡镇、县直单位，大家看了纷纷赞扬说：“太好了，这比逐个地方跑上十几天，省车省油又省时间，是廉政建设的一招好棋。”
