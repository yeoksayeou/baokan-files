    Guardians of the Law by the Banks of Lake Poyang
    — A Record of the Jiangxi Armed Police First Detachment

    "Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all the same, washing your face in muddy water. In summer and autumn, there are many mosquitoes and flies, and in winter, the cold wind howls." This is a rhyme composed by soldiers of the Jiangxi Armed Police First Detachment describing their living conditions.

    This detachment is primarily responsible for managing three labor reform farms along the vast shores of Lake Poyang. The young armed police soldiers understand the weight of their responsibilities and strive to be diligent and responsible guardians of the law.

    "Criminal Liu Guohua wants to escape!" Upon learning of this development, political instructor Xiao Wenlin immediately took the initiative to speak with Liu Guohua: "You were once a soldier with a glorious history. Because you did not understand the law and only knew about brotherhood and fighting, you committed crimes and should admit your guilt, repent, and start anew!" Xiao Wenlin's attitude was stern, but his words were sincere, striking Liu Guohua's heart. Liu Guohua shed tears of shame. Afterwards, Xiao Wenlin took the initiative to form a rehabilitation pairing with Liu Guohua.

    The detachment continuously conducts legal education for criminals, forms rehabilitation pairings, and regularly gives legal classes to criminals. The number of criminals who achieve merit, receive awards, and have their sentences reduced has increased. After receiving legal knowledge education, the criminals at Chengxin Labor Reform Farm's down jacket factory generally focused on reform, and production efficiency continued to improve.

    Since the second half of 1985, this detachment has established more than 30 joint construction points with various units, schools, factories, neighborhoods, stations, and docks in the areas where the battalions are stationed. They have sent dozens of propaganda teams to propagate legal knowledge. Once, during a fierce dispute among villagers in Shipu Township, Xinjian County, at this critical moment, Colonel Zeng Zhaoyuan, the detachment commander, led 14 soldiers to the scene. Together with public security officers, they stood hand in hand between the villagers who were facing off with sticks and hoes, loudly propagating criminal law knowledge to the crowd. After two hours of propaganda and mediation, the fight was finally quelled.

    The detachment's 10th Company established a joint construction point with Zhoujia Village, where officers and soldiers repeatedly educated the farmers on legal knowledge, significantly enhancing the villagers' sense of legal awareness. Six civil disputes were resolved appropriately, three cases of parental arranged marriages were dissolved, and eight households who originally planned to build houses on grain fields changed their construction sites.

    The officers and soldiers of this detachment often say, to uphold the dignity of the law, we must not only guard and reform criminals well but also continuously propagate legal knowledge. Eating a bit of bitterness and enduring a bit of hardship is nothing. Recently, this detachment was awarded the honorary title of "National Legal Propaganda Advanced Collective" by the Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Justice.

    鄱阳湖畔护法人
    ——江西武警一支队纪事
    赵相如　王洪良
    “春夏秋冬都一样，洗脸水中见泥浆。夏秋蚊子、苍蝇多，冬天寒风呼呼响”。这是江西武警一支队战士面对自己的生活实况所编的顺口溜。
    这个支队主要负责看管浩渺的鄱阳湖畔3个劳改农场。年轻的武警战士知道肩上的分量，争做尽职尽责的护法人。
    “犯人刘国华想跑！”政治指导员肖文林知道了这个动向后，立即主动找刘国华说：“你以前是一名军人，曾有过光荣的历史。因为你不懂法，只知道哥们义气，打架斗殴犯了罪，应当认罪悔过，重新做人才是出路！”肖文林态度严肃，但话语诚恳，句句打入刘国华的心坎。刘国华羞愧地掉下了泪水。之后，肖文林主动与刘国华结成了帮教对子。
    对犯人不断进行法律教育，组成帮教对子，定期给犯人上法律课，犯人中间立功受奖减刑的人多了。成新劳改农场羽绒厂的犯人在进行法律知识教育后，普遍安心改造，生产效益不断提高。
    这个支队从1985年下半年以来，还先后与各大队驻地的机关、学校、工矿、街道、车站、码头建立了30多个共建点，先后派出几十个宣传组去宣传法律知识。一次，新建县石埠乡村民发生激烈争斗。在这个危急关头，支队长曾昭泉上校带领14名战士赶来，协同公安干警， 手拉手站在扁担、锄头对峙的双方村民之间，向群众大声宣传刑法知识。经过两个小时的宣传和调解，终于平息了这场械斗。
    这个支队10中队与驻地周家村建立共建点后，干部战士反复向农民进行法律知识教育，使这个村的村民法制观念大为增强，6起民事纠纷得到妥善解决，3户父母包办婚约被解除，有8户原计划在粮田上建房的农民也改变了建房地点。
    这个支队的干部战士常说，为了维护法律的尊严，我们既要看押好、改造好犯人，也要不断地宣传法律知识。我们吃点苦受点累不算啥。最近这个支队被中宣部、司法部授予“全国普法先进集体”的光荣称号。
