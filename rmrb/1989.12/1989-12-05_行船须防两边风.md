Title: Navigating Must Guard Against Winds from Both Sides

While chatting with an old fisherman, he shared some insightful words: “When we go out to sea to fish, we often have to deal with winds and waves. Sometimes the winds and waves come rolling in from the left, sometimes from the right. There are even times when the winds from the left haven't passed, and suddenly the wind changes direction, and the waves come from the right instead. Our experience at sea tells us: 'Navigating must guard against winds from both sides!'”

The fisherman’s words made me think of some things that have happened over the past 40 years. Since the founding of the nation, our socialist ship has endured numerous attacks from both leftist and rightist winds and waves. If we can be alert and take proactive measures to prevent these winds and waves when they first arise, the ship will sail smoothly and quickly. If we fail to notice them in time, or even if we do notice but our measures to resist the winds and waves are obstructed, the ship’s progress will be affected, and the losses will be great.

This political storm that occurred during the transition from spring to summer can be traced back to the fact that, since the reform and opening up, we have only paid attention to countering the left (which is necessary), while neglecting the winds and waves coming from the right, allowing bourgeois liberalization to spread unchecked, leading to disastrous consequences.

Reflecting on the past, let us remember the words of that old fisherman who has weathered many storms: “Navigating must guard against winds from both sides!”

### “行船须防两边风”

    “行船须防两边风”
    缪润生
    跟一位老渔民聊天，他说了一席富有哲理的话：“我们出海打鱼，经常要跟风浪打交道。有时候风浪从左边翻滚过来，有时候风浪从右边翻滚过来。甚至还有这样的情况，左边的风浪还未过，突然风向一变，风浪又从右边袭来了。出海的经验告诉我们：“行船须防两边风！”
    渔民的这番话，使我联想到40年来的一些事情。建国以后，我们的社会主义航船，经受了多次“左”的和右的风浪的袭击。如果在“风起于青蘋之末”的时候，就能敏锐地觉察、积极地防范，“航船”前进就顺利，速度也快；如果觉察得迟，或虽有觉察，但抗击风浪的措施受阻，“航船”前进就受影响，损失就大了。
    春夏之交的这场政治风波，追本溯源，可以说就是改革开放以来，只注意了反“左”（这是必要的），而忽视了从右边来的风浪的袭击，为资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥种下了恶果。
    痛定思痛，让我们记住那位饱经风浪洗礼的老渔民的话：“行船须防两边风！”
