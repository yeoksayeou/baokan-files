The political turmoil of spring and summer 1989 vividly illustrated the sharp conflict between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization. It was the culmination of long-standing contradictions in the ideological sphere. Now that the storm has largely passed and the historic Fourth and Fifth Plenums of the Thirteenth Central Committee have been held, we should calmly review the party's ideological work over the past years and reflect on its successes and failures.

If we do not occupy the ideological front with socialist thought, it will be occupied by capitalist thought. Our party has always attached great importance to ideological work. There have been vivid and clear statements about the importance of ideological work, such as "ideological and political work is the lifeline of economic work and all other work" and "to overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion." These statements capture the essence of ideological work, emphasizing its importance from both positive and negative perspectives. Unfortunately, the importance of ideological work has been greatly overlooked in recent years, especially by the party's former top leadership. To write the great article of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to emphasize economic construction, reform and opening up, the development of high technology, and the formulation of the coastal development strategy, among other things. These are all necessary and are the essence of "one center." We have indeed achieved internationally recognized brilliant achievements in these areas. However, whether it is construction or reform and opening up, we must first have a firm and correct political direction. We must ensure that our construction and reform and opening up move forward along the socialist path, not deviate from this direction, and not go down the capitalist path. This requires us to pay great attention to ideological work while focusing on economic construction and reform and opening up. We must strengthen the awareness of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, rather than weakening or denying them. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, the Four Cardinal Principles are the fundamental prerequisite for achieving modernization. "If any of the Four Cardinal Principles is shaken, the entire socialist cause and the entire modernization construction will be shaken." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 159)

In recent years, the party's former top leadership has made serious mistakes in this regard, adopting a weak and conciliatory attitude towards the bourgeois liberalization trend, allowing it to spread widely, and making those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position become increasingly arrogant and unbridled.

From the perspective of theoretical guidance, there are two viewpoints that have caused great confusion in people's minds. One viewpoint is that Marxism is a theory from over a hundred years ago and cannot solve today's problems; this can be simplified as the "Marxism is outdated" theory. Another viewpoint is that since the focus is now on economic construction, there is no need to emphasize ideological and political work; this can be simplified as the "ideological dilution" theory. The view that Marxism cannot solve today's problems is completely wrong. Marxism was indeed born over a hundred years ago, but Marxism is a developing science. It continuously innovates based on new practices and new scientific achievements, which is the source of its vitality. Although the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao Zedong do not provide ready-made answers to the various practical problems we face today, if we truly understand their spirit and grasp the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought's standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, we can improve our ability to analyze and solve problems, thereby better solving the problems we face today. In this sense, it can be said that Marxism is not outdated now and will not be outdated in the future. The view that Marxism, a theory from over a hundred years ago, cannot solve today's problems is a metaphysical view that distorts the revolutionary and critical spirit of Marxism.

The view that since the focus is now on economic construction, there is no need to emphasize ideological and political work is also completely wrong. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the party's work focus has indeed shifted to economic construction. However, class struggle still exists in certain periods and within certain scopes, and under certain conditions, it may intensify. In this context, advocating the dilution of ideology is groundless. Moreover, although economic work is the center, economic work has a directionality issue. The party's ideological and political work is precisely about managing the political direction. In this sense, the statement that ideological and political work is the lifeline is completely correct. Our economic work should proceed along the socialist path, and our various economic policies should be formulated under the guidance of Marxism according to actual conditions. Without this, we cannot talk about socialist modernization. The fundamental difference between us and those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization is not whether we need reform, but in what direction this reform should proceed. The view that dilutes ideology erases the guiding role of ideological and political work, inevitably causing our economic construction and reform to lose direction. The reasons for the dilution and mistakes in ideological work over the past few years are not just limited to the neglect of thought by the party's former top leadership, but also need to find its theoretical roots.

The ideological front must be occupied by socialist thought, otherwise, it will be occupied by capitalist thought. The practice of recent years has fully proven this. Since there are errors in theoretical guidance and the struggle in the ideological sphere has been relaxed, it is inevitable that those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position will become more arrogant. They launch one theoretical poisonous arrow after another, forming an aggressive posture towards the party, socialism, and Marxism, and finally triggering the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion from April to June this year. Although we have achieved a decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, we must be soberly aware that the struggle in the ideological sphere has not ended, and there is still much work to be done in this regard.

The Long-Term, Arduous, and Complex Nature of the Struggle in the Ideological Sphere

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech to military officers above the rank of division during the martial law period that the occurrence of this turmoil was inevitable, caused by both the international climate and the domestic climate. The international climate refers to the strategy of peaceful evolution by international hostile forces, while the domestic climate refers to the spread of bourgeois liberalization. This judgment is correct. The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the end of the history of old China and the beginning of a new socialist historical period. The socialist system is a social system that opposes the capitalist system. The existence and development of the socialist system declare the bankruptcy of the myth that capitalism is invincible and will exist forever. Therefore, since the founding of New China, international hostile forces have been attempting to strangle it in its cradle. However, in the face of the Chinese people who have stood up, this arrogant plan has been repeatedly foiled, and international hostile forces have had to resort to other means. In the mid-1950s, Dulles proposed the strategy of "peaceful evolution," which was directly aimed at New China. In the 1980s, the overall international situation eased, and China implemented the policy of opening up to the outside world. Under this background, China's exchanges with foreign countries became increasingly frequent, and many foreign friends genuinely hoped for the success of China's reform. However, international hostile forces took advantage of our openness to infiltrate the ideological sphere, attempting to change the direction of China's reform and make it "converge" with capitalism. Under this international climate, those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position, taking advantage of some of our mistakes and the weakness and concessions of the party's former top leadership, launched a frenzied attack on the party and socialism. The international climate and the domestic climate essentially reflect the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the ideological sphere. In recent years, in criticizing the erroneous view of "taking class struggle as the key link," some people have gone to the opposite extreme, completely denying the existence of any class struggle in the current stage, and ignoring the correct judgment that class struggle still exists within certain periods and scopes and may intensify under certain conditions. This judgment has been proven correct by practice. The struggle in the ideological sphere will be long-term, and we cannot be complacent about it.

Currently, ideological work faces a severe situation and arduous tasks. We must not underestimate the serious destructive impact of the bourgeois liberalization trend in the ideological sphere over the past few years. Due to the spread of bourgeois liberalization, many theoretical right and wrong issues have been reversed, and people's minds have been confused. The theoretical right and wrong issues confused by bourgeois liberalization must be corrected one by one, to clear the mist and return to the source. The difficulty of this work lies not only in the fact that there are many theoretical issues to be clarified but also in the need to clearly and thoroughly explain Marxist views, especially Marxist views developed on the basis of summarizing new practices and new scientific achievements. This requires that comrades engaged in ideological work have a good grasp of Marxism and be good at combining Marxism with reality, using creative Marxist theory to oppose bourgeois liberalization views. In a sense, establishing the correct view is more difficult than refuting the wrong view. It is relatively easier to point out the errors of a viewpoint, but it is much more difficult to explain what the correct viewpoint is, why it is correct, and to truly have solid reasoning. Therefore, we must work hard on establishing the correct view, so that we can truly refute the bourgeois liberalization trend.

There is another difficulty in this work: those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position have indeed seized some of our mistakes and some of the shortcomings in party style and social customs. They raise slogans such as "strike down officials who profit from their positions" and "punish corruption," and make many statements. For them, these are just a cover, and their real intention is to use them as ammunition against the party and socialism. However, for us, these issues are indeed the focus of society and the concerns of the people, and they are also the sources of people's dissatisfaction. This means that to clear the theoretical mist and correct people's understanding, we must not only do a good job in ideological work but also concretely do some practical work. We must use our actual actions to refute the slander of those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position. Only by responding to the challenge of the bourgeois liberalization trend from both theoretical and practical aspects can we truly win the battle against bourgeois liberalization.

In opposing bourgeois liberalization, we must have a firm stance and clear banner, but at the same time, we must also see the complexity of this struggle; we must see the serious impact of the bourgeois liberalization trend, but also see the diversity of its manifestations. Those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position strongly express themselves politically. They either propose bourgeois liberalization political programs, such as the "Declaration of Private Ownership," or publish a large number of anti-party and anti-socialist statements, such as "public ownership is the root of all evil," "the attempt and failure of socialism is a great legacy of the 20th century," "socialism is utopian," and so on. These are direct deviations from the Four Cardinal Principles in politics and are naked expressions of bourgeois liberalization. The right and wrong of these views are relatively easy to judge, and their harm is also relatively easy to see. In addition to these, there are many theoretical views that are more complex. Some views, although influenced by the international climate and the domestic climate, and even deviating from Marxism, do not directly target the party and socialism. They involve deeper theoretical issues, and we must be cautious in dealing with these theoretical views. In these issues, there are also theoretical right and wrong issues, and the judgment of these theoretical right and wrong issues should be more meticulous and detailed. For example, the tendency and view of humanizing Marxism belong to this category.

Humanism is a relatively complex theoretical issue. Marxism does not generally oppose humanism. On the contrary, it believes that humanism has progressive significance in history and cannot be denied today. In a socialist society, socialist humanism should be advocated. In addition, the reason why the issue of humanism has become a hot topic in recent years is that there is a background to consider, that is, during the Cultural Revolution, many inhuman phenomena indeed occurred, and a large number of cadres and masses were treated inhumanely. Therefore, when summarizing the errors of the Cultural Revolution, people's demand to clarify the theory of humanism is understandable. But in recent years, under the influence of the bourgeois liberalization trend, some people, ignoring the essential differences between Marxism and humanism, equate Marxism and humanism in theory, saying that the essence and core of Marxism is humanism, or that the starting point and conclusion of Marxism is humanism. If this view can be established, then there is no historical materialism to speak of, because historical materialism is precisely produced in the context of breaking with all previous historical views, including humanism. And without historical materialism, there is no Marxism. This tendency to humanize Marxism is an international trend. Since the discovery of Marx's "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844" (also known as the Paris Manuscripts) in the late 1920s and early 1930s, this trend has never stopped. Its essence is to make Marxism and humanism converge, and its core is to oppose the Marxist theory of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. Many people in the West claim that the "Manuscripts" have made people rediscover Marx, and that Marx was originally a humanist. They assert that the later Marxist theory, which emphasizes class struggle, has deviated from Marx's original intention, and that the responsibility for this should be borne by Engels and Lenin. This arbitrary fabrication, which ignores history and facts, has even been echoed by some people in our country. This tendency to humanize Marxism not only has an international background but is also related to the domestic climate. Due to the spread of the bourgeois liberalization trend, the view of class struggle has been weakened in recent years, and the trend of erasing class struggle has grown. Although the tendency and view of humanizing Marxism deviate from Marxism and are influenced by bourgeois liberalization, they do not directly target the party and socialism, and they themselves involve a theoretical issue that is stronger and deeper. Therefore, we cannot deal with it hastily or simply. Moreover, since it is a theoretical issue with a stronger and deeper level, its theoretical right and wrong can only be clarified through further discussion in the theoretical circle. There are many similar issues. That is, in opposing bourgeois liberalization, we must distinguish levels and treat them differently. Such a distinction is not only in line with reality but also conducive to uniting the majority. It should be seen that those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position are a small minority, but those influenced by bourgeois liberalization are numerous. As long as we adopt a cautious attitude and correct policies, we can certainly achieve both distinguishing right and wrong and uniting comrades.

Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization and the Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools Policy

Since opposing bourgeois liberalization is a serious struggle, is the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend still valid in the ideological sphere? This is a concern of many comrades, especially those in the academic and theoretical circles. The policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is not a temporary policy but a fundamental policy for flourishing our country's academia. This policy is based on scientific grounds and is established on the basis of Marxist epistemology. Comrade Mao Zedong said that truth is revealed only in the struggle against falsehood, and the problems of the spiritual world cannot be resolved by administrative means. The right and wrong in academia and theory can only be resolved through discussion and contention. These judgments are completely in line with Marxist epistemology. Therefore, in academic and theoretical issues, carrying out the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is an objective necessity, which is not subject to the will of man and will not fundamentally change with the change of the situation.

Since the party proposed this policy in the mid-1950s, the practice of more than 30 years has proven that this policy is completely correct. Although the academic and theoretical circles of our country, like our republic, have gone through many hardships and taken a tortuous road in the past 30 years, the mainstream is good. It is during this period that our country's academia and theory have made great development, and the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend has played a promoting and driving role. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the enlightenment of the discussion on the criterion of truth and the correct guidance of the party's ideological line, our country has seen an unprecedented and lively atmosphere of emancipating the mind, and the party's policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend has also been unprecedentedly implemented. This is the fundamental reason for the unprecedented prosperity of our country's academia and theory in the past decade. This point cannot be doubted. Those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position, such as Yan Jiaqi and others, use the banner of emancipating the mind to deceive people everywhere. They do not truly advocate emancipating the mind or letting a hundred schools of thought contend. They only take advantage of the opportunity, engage in speculation, and take advantage of the party's opposition to the "two whatevers," the overall rectification of chaos, the promotion of emancipating the mind, and the further implementation of the double hundred policy to mix fish and dragons, attempting to peddle their bourgeois liberalization goods to achieve their ulterior motives. Due to the weakness and concessions of the party's former top leadership, their attempt has been partially realized. But this has nothing to do with emancipating the mind or letting a hundred schools of thought contend. It is not the emancipation of the mind and the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend that induced bourgeois liberalization, but the class struggle situation at home and abroad that induced bourgeois liberalization. Even if you do not emancipate the mind or let a hundred schools of thought contend, they will still engage in bourgeois liberalization.

From the perspective of summarizing experience and lessons, if we could have been soberly aware of a trend that had already emerged at the time of emancipating the mind and further implementing the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, that is, the trend of using the name of emancipating the mind and letting a hundred schools of thought contend to engage in bourgeois liberalization, and taken necessary measures to prevent and control it, the situation would have been much better. In fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping had already seen this point. At the later stage of the theoretical work conference, when the trend had just emerged, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his concluding speech that we must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles. This was a reminder to people that when opposing the leftist trend, we must prevent one trend from covering up another. Unfortunately, many people did not heed his warning, leading to the increasingly serious development of the situation later. Another point is that if we could have been very soberly aware that in further implementing the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, Marxism should occupy the dominant position among the hundred schools, and Marxism should play a guiding role in the contention, the situation would have been much better. Unfortunately, this point was not done well, giving those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position an opportunity. Our policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is not for the sake of contention but for the sake of seeking truth. Only under the guidance of Marxism, this universal truth, can we, through discussion and contention, clarify the right and wrong of many specific truths in academia and theory. The problem in recent years is not with the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend itself, but that under the influence of bourgeois liberalization, the dominant position of Marxism in the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend has been weakened, the voice of Marxism has been weakened and diluted, while the views that blindly follow the West and bourgeois liberalization have been greatly strengthened, with the intention of trying to dominate the world. Especially at that time, a so-called "new" theory emerged, that is, "pluralism of truth," which played a role in pushing the trend. Whether truth is one or many, as a theoretical issue, can be discussed. But the essence of this theoretical view is not in discussing whether truth is plural, but in denying the dominant position of Marxism. In their view, since truth is plural, any theory and other theories can only be in an equal position, and there can be no distinction between dominant and non-dominant; since Marxism is only one element of plural truth, it cannot occupy the dominant position in the ideological sphere. This is their conclusion. Under this guidance of public opinion, the position of Marxism has been further degraded to an extreme. After experiencing this political turmoil, we reflect on the past and look to the future, not to abandon the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, but to make this policy more fully and accurately implemented, so that our academic cause can prosper and develop along the correct path.

Firmly Continue the Policy of Reform and Opening Up

Since the strategy of peaceful evolution by international hostile forces is aimed at our construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics, should our policy of reform and opening up be changed? The answer is no. Our reform and opening up serve one purpose, which is to change those aspects of the superstructure and production relations that do not adapt to the development of productive forces, so that our socialist system can be more perfect and our modernization cause can develop more smoothly. Our implementation of reform and opening up is the necessary path to national prosperity. The history of the socialist system, starting from the victory of the October Revolution, has been 70 years, but due to the influence of a rigid model for a considerable period, the self-improvement mechanism of socialism has not been fully realized, and the superiority of socialism has not been well demonstrated. Our country's reform was proposed against this background. Comrade Deng Xiaoping became the chief architect of our country's reform precisely because he recognized this historical necessity. For a long time, under the influence of leftist thought, our country implemented a policy of closing the door to the outside world. Practice has proven that this self-sealing approach has had a great negative impact on the development of our country's economy, science and technology, and culture. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, if we close the door to the outside world and do not even communicate with the outside world, how can we absorb the advanced experience of others and use it for our own development? Therefore, ending the policy of closing the door to the outside world, abandoning self-sealing, and implementing opening up to the outside world is also a historical necessity.

We must be soberly aware that international hostile forces are attempting to make us converge with them through reform and achieve their goal of peaceful evolution. Some Western bourgeois politicians are already impatiently speculating about the great collapse of communism, claiming that capitalism can defeat it without a fight. They are using various channels and methods to intensify the ideological infiltration of socialist countries, including ours. Those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position, in response to international hostile forces, use the banner of reform and opening up to attempt to lead our reform and opening up astray. We must be highly vigilant about this. However, we cannot abandon reform and opening up just because domestic and foreign reactionary forces are engaging in evolution and infiltration, just as we cannot close the windows for fear of flies and mosquitoes. To summarize experience and lessons, it is very necessary to reflect on the past. But we must not draw the conclusion that reform and opening up are very bad, and we must not abandon reform and opening up as the price for opposing evolution and infiltration. In the past decade, we have achieved great achievements in reform and opening up, which is undeniable by anyone, and we ourselves must firmly believe in this. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, our reform and opening up are correct, and our economic development strategy is correct. In the future, it is not about stopping reform and opening up, but about further reform and opening up. The problem in the past was that the two basic points of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and adhering to reform and opening up were not well combined, resulting in international hostile forces and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position having an opportunity. In the future, we must combine the two basic points well, combine the foundation of the country with the path to prosperity, so that our reform and opening up can develop more healthily along the socialist course.

In summary, ideological work is a very important work, and we have many experiences and lessons to be seriously summarized in recent years. We must strengthen and improve ideological work, so that it can truly become a powerful ideological weapon to promote the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

### 要十分重视意识形态工作

    要十分重视意识形态工作
    邢贲思
    1989年春夏之交的这场政治风波，表现了四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，是长期以来意识形态领域的矛盾的总爆发。现在一场严重的政治风暴已经基本过去，有历史意义的党的十三届四中全会、五中全会已经开过，我们应当冷静地回顾一下这些年来党的意识形态工作，反思一下其中的是非得失。
    意识形态的阵地社会主义思想不去占领，
    就会被资本主义思想占领
    我们党过去一直很重视意识形态工作。关于意识形态工作的重要性，过去也有一些鲜明、生动的提法，比如思想政治工作是经济工作和其他一切工作的生命线；又如要推翻一个政权必先制造舆论。这些提法抓住了意识形态工作的要害，从正反两个方面告诉我们这一工作的重要性。可惜，这些年来关于意识形态工作的重要性这一点已经大大地被淡忘了，特别是被党的前主要领导人所淡忘了。为了写好建设有中国特色的社会主义这篇大文章，重视经济建设，重视改革开放，重视高技术的开发，重视沿海经济发展战略的制定等等，这些都是必要的，是“一个中心”的题中应有之义。这些年来在这方面我们确实取得了举世公认的光辉成就。但是，搞建设也好，搞改革开放也好，首先要有一个坚定正确的政治方向，要保证我们的建设、改革开放沿着社会主义的大道向前迈进，而不是背离这个方向，走到资本主义的邪路上去。这就要求我们在抓经济建设、改革开放的同时，必须十分重视意识形态工作，必须强化坚持四项基本原则的意识，而不是对之淡化乃至否定。正如邓小平同志指出的，四项基本原则是实现现代化的根本前提，“如果动摇了这四项基本原则中的任何一项，那就动摇了整个社会主义事业，整个现代化建设事业。”（《邓小平文选》第159页）
    这些年来，党的前主要领导人恰恰在这个问题上犯了严重错误，对资产阶级自由化思潮采取软弱、退让的态度，以致造成资产阶级自由化思潮的严重泛滥，使顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人得寸进尺，有恃无恐，达到了十分猖狂的地步。
    从理论导向看，有两个观点造成了人们思想上的很大混乱。一个观点就是所谓马克思主义是一百多年以前的理论，解决不了我们今天的问题，可简称为马克思主义过时论；另一观点就是所谓现在是以经济建设为中心，不需要再强调思想政治工作，可简称为意识形态淡化论。认为马克思主义解决不了我们今天的问题的观点是完全错误的。马克思主义确实诞生于一百多年以前，但马克思主义是一种发展的科学，它本身在新的实践和新的科学成果的基础上不断有所创新，这就是它的生命力之所在。在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、毛泽东的著作中虽然找不到解决我们今天所面临的各种实际问题的现成答案，但只要我们真正领会它们的精神实质，掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法，就能够使我们提高分析问题和解决问题的能力，从而较好地解决今天所面临的问题。从这个意义上可以说，马克思主义不但现在没有过时，而且将来也不会过时。认为马克思主义是一百多年前的理论不能解决我们今天的问题这种观点，没有把马克思主义看成是发展的科学，恰恰是一种歪曲了马克思主义的革命批判精神的形而上学观点。
    认为现在是以经济建设为中心，不需要再强调思想政治工作的观点也是完全错误的。十一届三中全会以后，党的工作重点确实已转移到经济建设上来，但是，阶级斗争在一定时期、一定范围内还存在，在一定条件下还可能激化，在这种情况下，主张淡化意识形态，是毫无根据的。何况，经济工作虽然是中心，但经济工作有一个方向问题，党的思想政治工作主要的恰恰就是管政治方向，从这个意义上说，思想政治工作是生命线是完全正确的。我们的经济工作应当沿着社会主义方向前进，我们的各项经济政策应当在马克思主义指导下根据实际情况来制定，舍此而外，就谈不上社会主义现代化。我们和那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人的根本分歧不在于要不要改革，而在于这种改革究竟应当沿着什么方向进行。那种主张淡化意识形态的观点，抹煞了思想政治工作的领航导向作用，势必使我们的经济建设和改革迷失方向。近几年来意识形态工作淡化、失误的原因，仅仅停留在党的前主要领导人的思想忽视这一点上是很不够的，而要找出它的理论根源。
    意识形态的阵地社会主义思想不去占领，资本主义思想就一定会去占领。这些年来的实践充分证明了这一点。既然在理论导向上有错误，在实践上又放松了意识形态领域中的斗争，就必然助长那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人的嚣张气焰。他们抛出一支又一支反党反社会主义的理论毒箭，形成了一个向党向社会主义向马克思主义猖狂进攻的态势，并且终于诱发了从今年4月到6月的动乱和反革命暴乱。现在我们虽已取得平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利，但是应当清醒地看到，意识形态领域的斗争并没有终结，在这方面我们还有许多工作需要去做。
    意识形态领域斗争的长期性、艰巨性和复杂性
    邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话指出，这次风波的到来是必然的，是由于国际大气候和国内小气候造成的。国际大气候就是指国际敌对势力的和平演变策略，国内小气候就是指资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥。这个论断十分正确。中华人民共和国的诞生，宣告了旧中国历史的终结，从此中国进入了崭新的社会主义历史时期。社会主义制度是和资本主义制度相对立的社会制度，社会主义制度的存在和发展，宣告了资本主义不可战胜、资本主义永恒存在的神话的破产。因此，国际敌对势力从新中国诞生之日起，就妄图把它扼杀在摇篮之中。但是，在已经站立起来的中国人民面前，这种狂妄的打算一次又一次地受挫，国际敌对势力不得不另作他图。50年代中期杜勒斯提出的“和平演变”就是一种战略变换，其矛头是直接指向新中国的。进入80年代，整个国际形势趋向缓和，我国又实行了对外开放政策，在这种背景下，我国同外国的交往日益频繁，许多外国友好人士真心希望我国的改革能够成功。但是国际敌对势力却利用我们的开放进行意识形态的渗透，妄图改变我国改革的方向，使之和资本主义“趋同”。在这种大气候下，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，利用我们的某些工作失误，利用党的前主要领导人的软弱、退让，向党向社会主义疯狂进攻。国际大气候和国内小气候实质上表现了资产阶级同无产阶级在意识形态领域的较量。近年来，在批判“以阶级斗争为纲”的错误观点时，有的人走到了另一个极端，根本否认现阶段有任何阶级斗争，对于在一定时期一定范围内还存在阶级斗争，以及阶级斗争在一定条件下可能趋向激烈的论断则淡忘了。而这一论断已被实践证明是完全正确的。意识形态领域的这种斗争将是长期的，对此我们不能掉以轻心。
      当前，意识形态工作面临着严峻的形势和艰巨的任务。不能低估这些年来资产阶级自由化思潮在意识形态领域的严重破坏作用。由于资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，许多理论是非被颠倒了，人们的思想被搞乱了。对于被资产阶级自由化思潮搞乱的理论是非要逐一加以纠正，做到廓清迷雾，正本清源。这项工作的艰巨性不仅在于需要廓清的理论问题很多，而且在于要从正面把马克思主义的观点讲明讲透，就是说不仅要破，而且要立。批驳资产阶级自由化论调如果不同时深刻阐明马克思主义观点，特别是在总结新的实践和新的科学成果的基础上发展了的马克思主义观点，这种批驳将是无力的。这就要求我们从事意识形态工作的同志本身有很好的马克思主义素养，要善于把马克思主义同实际相结合，用创造性的马克思主义理论来反对资产阶级自由化观点。从某种意义上讲，立比破要更为艰难。指出一种观点的错误相对来说要容易一些，但要说明正确的观点是什么，它为什么正确，真正做到有理有据，要远为困难得多。因此我们一定要在立字上狠下功夫，这样才能把资产阶级自由化思潮真正批透。
    这项工作还有一个难点，就是那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人确实也抓住了我们工作中的某些失误，抓住了党风和社会风气中的某些弊端。他们提出“打倒官倒”、“惩治腐败”等口号以及发表的许多言论，对他们来说是一种陪衬，醉翁之意不在酒，是他们反党反社会主义的炮弹，但对我们来说，确实需要认真对待。因为这些问题恰恰是社会所瞩目，人民群众所关心的，也是人民群众不满之所在。这就是说，要廓清理论的迷雾，端正人们的认识，不仅要做好意识形态工作，而且要切切实实地办一些实事，要用我们的实际行动来驳斥顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人的谰言。只有从理论和实践两个方面来回答资产阶级自由化思潮的挑战，我们才能真正夺得反对资产阶级自由化这场斗争的胜利。
    反对资产阶级自由化一定要立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，但同时又要看到这场斗争的复杂性；既要看到资产阶级自由化思潮的严重影响，又要看到这种影响表现的多样性。那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，在政治上顽强地表现自己，他们或者提出了资产阶级自由化的政治纲领，如《私有制宣言》之类，或者发表了大量反党反社会主义的言论，如“公有制是万恶之源”，“社会主义的尝试及其失败是20世纪的一大遗产”，“社会主义是乌托邦”，等等。这些都是在政治上直接背离四项基本原则，是赤裸裸的资产阶级自由化的表现。对这类观点的是非判断比较容易，它们的危害性也比较容易看清。除此之外，有大量的理论观点却比较复杂。有些观点虽也受国际大气候和国内小气候的影响，甚至对马克思主义有所背离，但矛头并不直接指向党指向社会主义，它所涉及的是理论上较深层次的问题，对待这些理论观点就需要慎重。在这些问题上也有理论是非，对这些理论是非的判断应当更加周密细致。比如把马克思主义人道主义化的倾向和观点就属于这一类。
    人道主义是一个相当复杂的理论问题。马克思主义并不一般反对人道主义，相反，认为人道主义不仅在历史上有进步意义，在现在也不能否定，在社会主义社会中应当提倡社会主义人道主义。此外，这些年来人道主义问题之所以成为热点，有一个背景要考虑到，这就是在文化大革命中，确实出现了许多反人道的现象，大批干部和群众受到非人道对待。因此，在清算“文革”错误时，人们要求从理论上讲清人道主义是可以理解的。但这些年来，在资产阶级自由化思潮影响下，有人则不顾马克思主义和人道主义的本质差别，从理论上把马克思主义和人道主义完全等同，说马克思主义的实质和核心是人道主义，或者说马克思主义的出发点和归结点是人道主义。这种观点如果能成立，也就没有历史唯物主义可言，因为历史唯物主义恰恰是在同包括人道主义在内的以往各种历史观决裂的情况下产生的。而没有历史唯物主义也就没有马克思主义。这种把马克思主义人道主义化的倾向是一种国际潮流。从20年代末30年代初马克思的《1844年经济学哲学手稿》（即巴黎手稿）被发现之日起，迄今为止，这股潮流始终没有终止过。它的实质是要使马克思主义和人道主义趋同，它的要害是反对马克思主义的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政学说。西方有许多人声称，《手稿》使人们重新发现了马克思，原来马克思是一个人道主义者。他们断言，后来的马克思主义学说大讲阶级斗争，是背离了马克思的初衷，认为这个责任应当由恩格斯和列宁来负。这种不顾历史、不顾事实的任意捏造，居然在我国国内也有人附和。这种把马克思主义人道主义化的倾向不仅有国际背景，也和国内气候有关。由于资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，这些年来阶级斗争的观点被淡忘了，以抹煞阶级斗争为内容的思潮滋长起来。尽管把马克思主义人道主义化的倾向和观点是背离马克思主义的，是受到了资产阶级自由化的影响，但毕竟它并没有把矛头直接指向党指向社会主义，而且本身又涉及到一个理论性比较强、层次比较深的问题，因而对待它不能草率从事、简单从事。而且它既然是一个理论层次比较深的问题，它的理论是非也只有通过理论界的进一步讨论才能加以廓清。类似的问题还有很多。就是说，在反对资产阶级自由化时，一定要分清层次，区别对待。这样一种区分不但是符合实际的，而且有利于团结大多数。应当看到，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人是极少数，但受资产阶级自由化影响的人却为数不少。只要我们采取审慎的态度和正确的政策，就一定能够做到既分清是非，又团结同志。
    反对资产阶级自由化和双百方针
    反对资产阶级自由化既然是一场严重的斗争，那么在意识形态领域的双百方针特别是百家争鸣的方针是否还有效？这是现时很多同志特别是学术界、理论界的同志所关心的。百家争鸣的方针不是一时的方针，而是繁荣我国学术的根本方针。这一方针是有科学根据的，是建立在马克思主义认识论基础上的。毛泽东同志说过，真理只有在同谬误相比较相斗争的时候才得以显示，人的精神世界的问题不能靠行政手段来处置，学术上、理论上的是非只有通过讨论、争鸣才能够解决。这些论断是完全符合马克思主义认识论的。因此，在学术、理论问题上开展百家争鸣是客观的必然，是不以人的意志为转移的，是不会因为形势变化而根本改变的。
      从50年代中期党提出这一方针以来，30多年来的实践证明这一方针是完全正确的。尽管30多年来我国的学术界、理论界和我们的共和国一样历尽沧桑，走过了一条曲折的道路，但是其主流是好的，正是在这期间我国的学术、理论有很大发展，而百家争鸣的方针则起了推动促进作用。党的十一届三中全会以来，在真理标准讨论的启迪下，在党的正确的思想路线指引下，我国出现了前所未有的、生动活泼的思想解放局面，党的百家争鸣的方针也得到了前所未有的贯彻。这是十年来我国学术、理论空前繁荣的根本原因。这一点不容有丝毫的怀疑。顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人如严家其之流，打着思想解放的旗号，到处招摇撞骗，他们并不真正赞成思想解放，也并不真正赞成百家争鸣，他们只是钻空子，搞投机，趁我们党反对“两个凡是”、进行全局上的拨乱反正、推动思想解放，进一步贯彻双百方针之际，鱼目混珠，妄图兜售他们那套资产阶级自由化的货色，以达到他们不可告人的目的。由于党的前主要领导人的软弱、退让，他们的这一企图部分地得到了实现。但这和思想解放无关，也和百家争鸣无关。并不是思想解放和百家争鸣诱发了资产阶级自由化，而是国际和国内的阶级斗争形势诱发了资产阶级自由化。即使你不搞思想解放，不搞百家争鸣，他们照样会搞资产阶级自由化的那一套。
    从总结经验教训的角度看，如果我们在解放思想、进一步贯彻百家争鸣的方针时，能够清醒地看到当时已经出现的一种倾向，即那种以思想解放、百家争鸣为名，行资产阶级自由化之实的倾向，并且采取必要的对策以防微杜渐，那么情况就会好得多。其实，这一点邓小平同志早就已经看到了。还在理论工作务虚会的后期，正当风起于清萍之末，这种倾向刚刚露头时，邓小平同志就在这个会的总结性讲话中指出，要坚持四项基本原则，这是提醒人们在反对左的倾向时，要防止一种倾向掩盖另一种倾向，可惜很多人对他的这一告诫充耳不闻，以至后来事态的发展愈来愈严重。另一点是，如果我们在进一步贯彻百家争鸣方针的时候，能够非常清醒地认识到在百家中马克思主义应占主导地位，在争鸣中马克思主义应起指导作用，情况也会好得多。可惜这一点也没有能做好，以致给了顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人以可乘之机。我们的百家争鸣不是为争鸣而争鸣，而是为了辨明真理。只有在马克思主义这一普遍真理的指导下，我们才能通过讨论、争鸣，对许多学术、理论上的具体真理分清是非。这些年来的问题不是出在百家争鸣本身，而是由于受到了资产阶级自由化影响，在百家争鸣中马克思主义的主导地位降低了，马克思主义的声音削弱了、淡化了，而盲目追随西方的观点、资产阶级自由化的观点却大大加强，大有跃跃欲试妄图一统天下之势。特别是当时出现了一种所谓“新”理论，即“真理多元论”，对这股潮流起了推波助澜作用。真理是一元还是多元，作为一个理论问题可以讨论。但这种理论观点的要害不在于论述真理是否多元，而在于否定马克思主义的主导地位。在他们看来，既然真理是多元的，任何一种理论和其他理论只能处于平等地位，就不能有主导、非主导之分；马克思主义既然只是多元真理中的一元，它也就不能在意识形态领域占主导地位。这就是它的结论。在这种舆论导向下，马克思主义的地位更是被贬低到无以复加的地位。
    经历了这场政治风波以后，我们反思过去，展望未来，不是要收起百家争鸣的方针，而是要使这一方针能够更加全面更加准确地得到贯彻，使我国的学术事业能够沿着正确的方向更加繁荣和发展。
    坚定不移地继续执行改革开放的方针
    国际敌对势力的和平演变策略既然是指向我们建设有中国特色的社会主义的，那么我们的改革开放政策是否应当改变？答案是否定的。我们的改革开放服务于一个目的，就是通过改变那些不适合生产力发展的生产关系和上层建筑的某些环节，使我们的社会主义制度更加完善，使我们的现代化事业更加顺利地发展。我们实行改革开放是国家富强的必由之路。社会主
  义制度的历史从十月革命的胜利算起已有70年，但由于在相当长的时期内受到一种僵化模式的影响，社会主义自我完善的机制并未充分实现，社会主义的优越性也没有得到很好的发挥。我国的改革就是在这种背景下提出的。邓小平同志之所以成为我国改革的总设计师，正因为他认清了这一历史的必然。长期以来，在左的思想影响下，我国实行了闭关锁国政策。实践证明，这种自我封闭的做法对我国的经济、科技和文化的发展起了极大的消极作用。正如邓小平同志说的，闭关锁国，连外边的信息都不通，又如何吸取别人的先进经验，做到为我所用，以促进我们自己的发展呢？因此，终止闭关锁国，放弃自我封闭，实行对外开放，这也是历史的必然。
    我们应当清醒地看到，国际敌对势力妄想我们经过改革和他们“趋同”，达到他们和平演变的目的。西方某些资产阶级政治家已迫不及待地在那里妄论共产主义大溃败，资本主义对它可以不战而胜。他们通过各种渠道，采取各种方式，正在加紧对包括我国在内的社会主义国家进行意识形态的渗透。那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，和国际敌对势力相呼应，打着改革开放的旗号，妄图把我们的改革开放引上歧途。对此，我们应当保持高度警惕。但是，我们不能因噎废食，不能因为国内外反动势力搞演变、搞渗透，就不敢坚持改革开放，就如同不能因为怕苍蝇蚊子飞进来不敢打开窗户一样。为了总结经验教训，反思一下过去很有必要。但决不能得出改革开放糟得很的结论，决不能为了反演变反渗透而以放弃改革开放为代价。十年来，我们的改革开放取得了伟大的成就，这是任何人都无法否认的，我们自己更应当坚信不疑。正如邓小平同志说的，我们的改革开放没有错，我们的经济发展战略没有错，今后不是要收起改革开放，而是要更加改革开放。过去的问题是坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放这两个基本点没有结合好，以致使得国际敌对势力和国内顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人有了可乘之机。今后一定要把两个基本点结合好，把立国之本和强国之路结合好，使我们的改革开放沿着社会主义航向更加健康地向前发展。
    总之，意识形态工作是一项十分重要的工作，这些年来我们有许多经验教训需要认真总结。我们必须加强和改善意识形态工作，使它真正成为推动有中国特色的社会主义这一伟大事业向前发展的强有力的思想武器。
