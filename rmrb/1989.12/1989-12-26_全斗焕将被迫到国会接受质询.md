Chun Doo-hwan, the former president of South Korea, will be compelled to testify before the National Assembly on December 31st. He will be questioned about the suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and a series of illegal manipulations that occurred during his tenure.

This news was revealed by some of Chun Doo-hwan's former close associates after they visited him on the evening of the 24th.

The decision for Chun Doo-hwan to testify before the National Assembly on December 31st was made by two special committees within the National Assembly on the 23rd. These committees were established to investigate major political issues that occurred during Chun Doo-hwan's presidency. Choi Kyu-ha, the former president who is considered a key informant regarding Chun Doo-hwan's rise to power through a coup, has also been notified to testify before the National Assembly on December 30th.

    全斗焕将被迫到国会接受质询
    南朝鲜前总统全斗焕将被迫于十二月三十一日到国会作证，就在他掌权期间发生的镇压光州起义和一系列非法舞弊事件接受质询。
    这一消息是全斗焕从前的几名亲信在二十四日晚上探望他之后向记者们透露的。
    让全斗焕于十二月三十一日到国会作证的决定，是南朝鲜国会内的两个特别委员会在二十三日作出的。这两个委员会是专门为清理全斗焕执政时期发生的一些重大政治悬案而设立的。被认为是全斗焕通过政变上台的重要知情人的前任总统崔圭夏也已被通知在十二月三十日到国会作证。
