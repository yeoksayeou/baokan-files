An activity to study the heroic youth Lei Ning is being widely carried out among the broad masses of young pioneers.

Jiang Zemin, General Secretary, highly praised Lei Ning's deeds when he met with the "National Ten Outstanding Young Pioneers." In his letter to the young pioneers and Young Pioneer workers across the nation, he proposed: "I hope that all young pioneers in the country will learn from Lei Ning, strive to catch up with the advanced, establish revolutionary ideals, cultivate noble morality, study cultural and scientific knowledge well, temper a strong physique, and in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's teachings, become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline."

Comrade Li Peng inscribed: "Learn from Lei Ning's comrade who has great aspirations and starts from a young age; learn from Lei Ning's comrade who loves science and dares to practice; learn from Lei Ning's comrade who is proactive and develops comprehensively; learn from Lei Ning's comrade who loves the motherland and is fearless in the face of danger."

Comrade Deng Yingchao wrote: "I hope that all primary and secondary school students across the country will learn from Lei Ning's example, be good children of the Party like him, live a meaningful life like him, and put the interests of the state and the people above everything else, becoming 'four-haves' new people who are worthy of the times and the country's expectations."

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the State Education Commission decided to confer the title of "Heroic Youth" on Lei Ning. The National Committee of the Chinese Young Pioneers issued a notice to widely carry out the activity of "Learning from Lei Ning and the 'Ten Outstanding,' Striving to Be Excellent Young Pioneers."

The greatest characteristic of Lei Ning is that he truly places the interests of the people and the motherland above everything else. This is his understanding and also his practice. For the interests of the people and the motherland, he studied cultural and scientific knowledge with great enthusiasm; for the interests of the people and the motherland, he strictly demanded of himself, tempered his physique through hard work, and seriously strengthened his moral cultivation; for the interests of the people and the motherland, he fearlessly rushed into danger, daring to face fire and water, and ultimately sacrificed his young life.

We know that the happiness of every generation ultimately depends on that generation's own creation and defense. The older generation of revolutionaries led and united the people of the entire country to create a republic of their own, ending the history of the Chinese people being enslaved and exploited, because they mastered the scientific truths of revolution, could concentrate their strength in the collective struggle of the entire class and people, and could, for the interests of the people, fight to the death, fearing no sacrifice, to strive for victory. This victory is a collective victory, a victory of all the people, a victory won through collective struggle. This is the first time in the history of the Chinese people that the laboring masses have obtained a victory in which they control their own destiny. Whether this victory can be maintained and developed for a long time depends on the next generation and their qualities. Can they recognize that their own interests are only a part of the collective and national interests? Can they recognize that their own interests can only be created through their own labor and defended through their own struggles? Can they master the skills to build a new life in modern society, understand the class struggles in the political, ideological, and economic domains of modern society, see through various deceitful words that seek to exploit their interests, and can they stand firm in the face of storms and bravely fight? All these will ultimately determine their fate. The task of today's adults is to cultivate such a new generation—fundamentally, the successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

This is an arduous task; because the conditions of life for the next generation are different from those of the older generation, they certainly cannot personally experience the exploitation and oppression of the old society, and they have fewer severe tests of struggle. How will they form a life view that puts collective interests first? How will they form a firm revolutionary stance and a resolute revolutionary will? It is reasonable for many people to worry about such problems. Lei Ning's growth is a good answer. Studying and summarizing the experiences of Lei Ning and other outstanding young people's growth, improving our school education, family education, and social education for young children, and cultivating more young children who have ideals, love the motherland and the people, study diligently, and have strong wills, should become an urgent and important task at present.

In Lei Ning's growth process, an important experience is to learn from heroic figures. When starting on the road of life, seeking one's own role model is a psychological state shared by almost every young child. Such a role model should not be limited to young children, as the road of life they have traveled is relatively short. However, heroic figures of the same age will make young children feel more intimate. The deeds, thoughts, and actions of these young heroes are so similar to their own, or at least something they can also achieve, making it easier to learn from. Liu Huilan, Liu Wenzhi, Long Mei, and Yu Rong, these young heroes, once played a tremendous exemplary role among the young children of that time, which is proof of this.

Learning from Lei Ning should not be just an activity for the Young Pioneers. To make this activity widely and deeply carried out, it is necessary for all levels of party organizations, governments, educational departments, cultural departments, families, and the whole society to care for and support it. We must create such an environment where our descendants can feel that there are many advanced role models guiding them in every step forward, emulating the virtuous, and everyone takes pride in being advanced, thus solidly laying the foundation for a proletarian worldview. If we do this, our country's future will be full of hope.

    把学习赖宁的活动普遍开展起来
    徐惟诚
    一个学习英雄少年赖宁的活动正在广大少年儿童中展开。
    江泽民总书记在接见“全国十佳少先队员”的时候，对赖宁的事迹作了高度评价。他在致全国少先队员和少先队工作者的信中提出：“希望全国的少先队员们向赖宁学习，向先进看齐，树立革命理想，培养高尚道德，学好文化科学知识，锻炼强健体魄，按照邓小平同志的教导，成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    李鹏同志为学习赖宁题词：“学习赖宁同学胸怀大志，从小做起；学习赖宁同学热爱科学，勇于实践；学习赖宁同学积极进取，全面发展；学习赖宁同学热爱祖国，临危不惧。”
    邓颖超同志著文说：“我希望全国的中小学生都来学习赖宁的榜样，像他那样做党的好孩子，像他那样有意义地生活，像他那样把国家和人民的利益看得高于一切，做无愧于时代要求和祖国期望的‘四有’新人。”
    共青团中央和国家教委作出了授予赖宁“英雄少年”光荣称号的决定。中国少年先锋队全国工作委员会发出了广泛开展“学赖宁、学‘十佳’，争做优秀少先队员”活动的通知。
    赖宁的最大特点就在于他真正把人民的利益、祖国的利益放在高于一切的地位。这是他的认识，也是他的实践。为了人民的利益、祖国的利益，他如饥似渴地努力学习文化科学知识；为了人民的利益、祖国的利益，他严格地要求自己，刻苦地锻炼自己的体魄，认真加强自己的道德品质修养；为了人民的利益、祖国的利益，他奋不顾身，敢于赴汤蹈火，最后献出了自己年轻的生命。
    我们知道，每一代人的幸福生活，归根到底要靠这一代人自己去创造，去保卫。老一辈革命者领导和团结全国人民缔造了人民自己的共和国，结束了中国人民被奴役被剥削的历史，是因为他们掌握了革命的科学真理，能够把自己的力量凝聚在整个阶级和人民的集体奋斗之中，是因为他们能够为了人民的利益，前仆后继，不畏牺牲，去争取胜利。这个胜利是集体的胜利，是全体人民的胜利，是靠集体的奋斗得来的胜利。这是自有文字历史以来中华民族的劳动人民第一次得到的自己掌握自己命运的胜利。这个胜利能不能长期保持和发展，只能寄希望于下一代，看他们的素质如何。他们能不能认识到他们自己的利益只能是集体的利益、国家的利益的一部分，能不能认识到他们自己的利益只能靠他们自己的劳动来创造，靠自己的斗争来保卫，能不能掌握现代社会建设新生活的本领，懂得现代社会政治、思想、经济领域的阶级斗争，识破种种骗取他们利益的花言巧语，能不能在风浪面前站稳脚跟，勇敢地进行斗争，这一切将最终决定他们的命运。今天的成年人的任务则是造就这样一代新人——从根本上说，也就是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    这是一项艰巨的任务；因为下一代生活的条件已经不同于老一辈，他们当然不可能亲身经历旧社会那种剥削和压迫，也少有严酷斗争的考验，他们将怎样形成集体利益第一的人生观？他们将怎样形成坚定的革命立场和坚毅的革命意志呢？不少人为这样的问题担心，是有道理的。赖宁的成长是一个很好的回答。研究和总结赖宁以及其他优秀少年成长的经验，改进我们对少年儿童的学校教育、家庭教育和社会教育，使更多的胸怀理想，热爱祖国，热爱人民，刻苦学习，意志坚强的少年儿童成长起来，应该成为当前的一项迫切而重要的任务。
    在赖宁成长道路中，一条重要的经验就是向英雄人物学习。在跨上人生道路时，要寻找自己的人生榜样，是几乎每一个少年儿童共有的心理状态。这种榜样当然不应当限于少年儿童，他们走过的人生道路毕竟比较短。但是同龄的英雄人物又会使少年儿童倍感亲切，这些少年英雄的所作所为所思，同自己是那样相似，或者至少是自己也能够做得到的，更便于学习。刘胡兰、刘文学、龙梅和玉荣这些少年英雄曾经在当年的少年儿童当中起过多么巨大的榜样作用，就是证明。
    学习赖宁不应当仅仅是少先队的活动。要使这个活动广泛深入地开展起来，需要各级党组织、政府、教育部门、文艺部门、广大家长以至全社会都来关心和支持。我们一定要造成这样一种环境，使我们的后代在前进的每一步都能感到有许多先进的榜样在指引着自己，见贤思齐，大家都以先进为荣，从而扎扎实实地打下无产阶级世界观的基础。我们这样去做了，我们祖国的未来就是大有希望的。
