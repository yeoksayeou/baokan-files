	People's Daily, Beijing, December 7th — Today in the afternoon, the spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to reporters' questions regarding the claim that the "Cold War" has ended at a press conference. The spokesperson pointed out that the current international situation is undergoing significant changes, and hegemony is increasingly unfeasible. However, strong-arm politics has not completely left the stage of history. In international interactions, it is still evident that attempts are being made to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries using various means. This is a violation of international norms. The result of pursuing strong-arm politics is that it does not contribute to the easing of international tensions but can only lead to the continuation of the "Cold War."

    强权政治并未完全退出历史舞台
    本报北京十二月七日讯　中国外交部发言人今天下午在新闻发布会上就有关“冷战”已经结束的说法回答了记者的提问。发言人指出，当前，国际形势正在发生重大变化，霸权主义越来越行不通了。但强权政治并未完全退出历史舞台。在国际交往中还可以明显地看到，利用各种手段干涉别国内部事务的企图。这是违背国际关系准则的。推行强权政治的结果是，不利于国际形势的缓和，只能导致“冷战”的继续。
