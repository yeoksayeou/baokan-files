Like many other places, contradictions and grievances, dissatisfaction, also occur here from time to time. However, the farmers in Zhaozhou County are content and have high enthusiasm for production. How do the leaders there do their work? Let's take a look—strengthening coordination and providing serious service.

Zhaozhou Impression: Farmers are Content

Zhaozhou County, located in the southwest of Heilongjiang Province, was once known for its poverty. "Saline-alkali land, yellow skin, nine out of ten years of drought, no grain." For many years, the grain yield per unit area hovered around 100-200 kilograms, until 1985 when the per capita income of farmers was still less than 330 yuan.

Recently, we went there for an interview and were delighted to see that Zhaozhou has changed: the former low-yield county has now become a major grain-producing county. Last year, the grain yield per unit area was 360 kilograms, ranking among the top in Heilongjiang Province, and was commended by the State Council. The increase in grain production has driven the development of livestock and township enterprises, and farmers' per capita income has also been increasing year by year. In 1988, it reached 650 yuan.

The changes left an impression on us, but what impressed us even more was the contentment and high enthusiasm for production among the farmers here. Many farmers said: Our county leaders are reasonable, we have nothing to say, we just focus on farming and production.

They told us that before sowing, the county sends seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to their homes, so farmers don't have to run around themselves, nor do they have to worry about these items being fake or substandard. If there are any problems with these items, the county will compensate for all losses; how to use fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds, and what new methods there are, all these are taught during the winter scientific learning sessions, so everyone has a clear idea and won't use them blindly; loans are also timely, and poor households can get loans guaranteed by relatively wealthy party members and cadres, so there's no need to worry about not getting a loan; there's also information, such as which items are in demand and which may not be, the county also provides this, which is more accurate than farmers "feeling" it out themselves...

With fewer distractions, farmers can concentrate on putting effort into their crops. In recent years, grain has been harvested abundantly year after year, and there's no need for the county to urge the delivery of grain. County officials said that they haven't received any complaints from farmers about this for several years.

Treating Coordination as an Important Responsibility

Zhaozhou is not a utopian place. Like other places, issues that easily cause farmer dissatisfaction also frequently occur here.

Land is contracted to households, but farmers are also required to accept the state's planting plan. Doesn't this create a contradiction?

The state's purchase price for grain is low, while the market price is high. Farmers are unwilling to sell to the state. What should be done?

The price of sugar beets is low, and farmers are unwilling to plant them. However, the sugar factory needs sugar beets, and the state needs sugar. What should be done?

The price of agricultural production materials has skyrocketed, and farmers can't afford it. What should be done?

The circulation channels are not smooth, and farmers face obstacles in selling their agricultural products. What should be done?

Such contradictions are constantly presented to the leaders of the Zhaozhou County Party Committee and the county government.

The leaders here are clear-headed. They analyze that in the transitional period between the old and new systems, and during the period of planned commodity economy, there will be more contradictions than before. This is a normal phenomenon. Farmers are now independent commodity operators, and their interests, once in conflict with the state's interests, will react more sensitively than before. As the county Party Committee and county government, they must be responsible to the state and also to the farmers, truly unifying the two is an important responsibility of the county Party Committee and county government in the new era.

They conducted in-depth investigations in rural areas and deeply felt that farmers who had just shaken off poverty had very fragile bearing capacities. On the surface, a per capita income of over 600 yuan is not low, but there are many expenses: they need to add quilts, buy vehicles, and renovate their houses... For a long time, their family assets have been very thin. Now, farmers are actually still in the "bottom-up" stage, they need protection and support.

After having a realistic understanding of the farmers' situation, the county Party Committee and county government decided that the principle of coordinating contradictions is: to protect the farmers' legal rights according to policies and to mobilize the farmers' enthusiasm for production.

With a clear guiding ideology, coordinating contradictions has a "plan."

Heilongjiang is the sugar beet sugar production base of our country. However, in recent years, farmers generally do not want to plant sugar beets because the price of sugar beets is low, planting them is labor-intensive, and they also damage the soil. Zhaozhou County has 2 sugar factories, each year needing to process 180,000 tons of sugar beets, which means the county must ensure the planting of 150,000 mu of sugar beets every year. Otherwise, the factory will not have enough to process, not only will it incur losses, but it will also fail to complete the sugar production task assigned by the state. The county conducted an analysis and formulated 8 preferential policies for the sugar factory to benefit farmers, stipulating that the loan interest for planting sugar beets will be paid by the sugar factory; seeds will be supplied at half price, with the other half subsidized by the sugar factory; fertilizers and pesticides will also be provided at preferential prices; to facilitate the farmers' delivery of sugar beets, a purchase station will be set up in each township, and the transportation cost from the township to the sugar factory will be borne by the sugar factory... In this way, the farmers' enthusiasm has been aroused. Since 1986, Zhaozhou County has not only ensured the planting area of sugar beets but also achieved high yield and good quality. The 2 sugar factories have therefore had enough to process and have been profitable every year. However, some places' sugar factories have incurred losses due to insufficient operation.

In 1988, Zhaozhou had a bumper grain harvest, especially the 100,000 mu of corn, with an average yield of 449 kilograms per mu. However, some counties had grain disasters and reduced production. Therefore, the higher authorities added a contract purchase task of 30 million kilograms to Zhaozhou. At that time, the market price of corn was about 6 fen higher per kilogram than the state's purchase price. After receiving the task, the Zhaozhou County Party Committee and county government did not take a hardline approach but explained to the farmers that some brother counties had disasters and could not complete the task, and since we had a bumper harvest, we should take on more responsibilities for the state. At the same time, the county considered that the soybean yield in the county had not reached the planned amount, and after reporting to the higher authorities, decided to appropriately reduce some of the soybean contract purchase tasks. Farmers felt that the county Party Committee and county government's approach was reasonable, and in just a few days, they completed the delivery of 30 million kilograms of corn.

Service: A Bridge to Increase Understanding

During a conversation with reporters, Zhaozhou County Party Secretary Ma Dianyu and County Governor Wang Guoxue both had deep feelings and said that some contradictions were not handled well because the county-level party and government organs, as representatives of the state, did not serve the farmers enough and their work was not thorough. They believe that the state's policies towards farmers need to be implemented through the county's services, and farmers' demands of the state also need to be satisfied through the county's services. After farmers start dispersed operations, some things become difficult to handle, and if we do not provide services, they will have complaints. Therefore, service is the link to coordinate the interests of the state and farmers, and the medium to harmonize the relationship between farmers and the state. If the service work is done well, many contradictions will be easily resolved.

Fertilizer is a production material that has been troubling farmers in recent years. First, there is a shortage, second, it is not timely, and third, the price is high. Zhaozhou needs 100,000 standard tons of fertilizer each year, but the state can only allocate 40,000 standard tons. The county Party Committee and county government urgently address the farmers' concerns, requiring relevant departments at the county and township levels to start preparing for the next year's fertilizer eight or nine months in advance, purchasing, storing, and the cost of wastage, all borne by the county finance, with the county spending 20 million yuan each year for this. By the time spring comes, the fertilizer is delivered to the farmers' homes, and there is no price increase. Therefore, in recent years, the farmers in Zhaozhou have not been troubled by the lack of fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased from 20 standard kilograms to 50 standard kilograms.

Corn is the main crop in Zhaozhou. For a long time, the corn yield per mu has not exceeded 200 kilograms. The county Party Committee and county government invited corn experts to study and conducted experiments in 7 farmers' homes, and later conducted a 10,000 mu breakthrough, gradually exploring the high-yield path of "good seeds, high density, high input." After the experience matured, each township and village used the winter to teach farmers, and in the spring and summer, they taught step by step. Farmers followed the instructions, and the yield increased exponentially. In the past two years, farmers with a corn yield of 800-900 kilograms per mu have emerged in large numbers.

In Zhaozhou, farmers are not allowed to purchase seeds on their own, and the county people's congress has formulated relevant regulations, stipulating that seeds must be uniformly supplied by the county to ensure that they are both good and pure. The same goes for pesticides, to prevent farmers from being cheated, they are also uniformly purchased and supplied by the county.

To reduce the burden on farmers, this spring, the county issued a "people's notice" clearly stating the items that farmers should bear. Anything beyond the regulations is considered an illegal levy, and farmers have the right to refuse. As for the establishment of township enterprises, the county Party Committee and county government are even more proactive, providing thoughtful services. Last year, this county, which has relatively poor conditions in all aspects, had a total output value of township enterprises exceeding 1.4 billion yuan, with a profit of 130 million yuan, an increase of 62% compared to 1987.

    与其他许多地方一样，矛盾纠葛，不满情绪，这里也时有发生。可是，肇州县的农民心平气顺，生产劲头很高。那里的领导是怎么做工作的？请看——
    加强协调  认真服务
    新华社记者　张持坚　新华社通讯员　周晓冰
    肇州印象：农民心平气顺
    位于黑龙江省西南部的肇州县，曾以贫困而闻名。“盐碱地，破皮黄，十年九旱不打粮”。多少年来，粮食单产始终在一二百公斤之间徘徊，直到1985年农民人均收入还不足330元。
    最近，我们到这里采访，欣喜地看到肇州变了：昔日低产县，如今成了产粮大县，去年粮食单产360公斤，名列黑龙江省前茅，受到国务院的表彰。粮食丰收，带动了畜牧业，带动了乡镇企业，农民人均收入也逐年提高。1988年达到650元。
    变化给我们留下了印象，然而，给我们印象更深的，是这里的农民心平气顺，生产劲头很高。不少农民说：咱县上讲理，我们没啥说的，一门心思伺弄地，搞生产就是了。
    他们告诉我们，播种前，县上把良种、化肥和农药送到家，不用农民自己出去乱跑，更不用担心这些东西是假的、劣的，这些东西出毛病，县上包赔一切损失；化肥、农药、种子怎么个使法，有哪些新说道，冬季学科学的时候，都教过了，大家心里有谱，不会用“瞎”；贷款也及时，贫困户贷款由收入比较多的党员、干部家担保，不用担心贷不着；还有信息，哪样东西好销，哪样可能不好销，县上也给提供，比农民自己“摸”准多了……
    分心事少，农民就集中精力往庄稼上使劲。这些年粮食连年丰收，交粮不用县上催。县里同志说，已好几年没有收到农民这方面的告状信了。
    把协调作为重要职责
    肇州并非世外桃园。和其他地方一样，容易引发农民不满情绪的事，也时常发生。
    田地承包到户了，可又要农民接受国家下达的种植计划，这里面不存在矛盾吗？
    收购粮食，国家价低，市场价高，农民不愿卖给国家，怎么办？
    甜菜价低，农民不愿种，可糖厂需要甜菜，国家需要食糖，怎么办？
    农业生产资料价格猛涨，农民承受不了，怎么办？
    流通渠道不畅，农民出售农副产品受阻，怎么办？
    诸如此类的矛盾，不断地摆到肇州县委、县政府领导的面前。
    这里的当家人头脑是清醒的。他们分析，在新旧体制交替的时期，在进行有计划的商品经济的时期，矛盾要比以前多，这是正常现象。农民已经是独立的商品经营者，他们的利益一旦同国家利益发生矛盾，反应肯定要比过去敏感。作为县委、县政府要对国家负责，同时也要对农民负责，把这两者真正统一起来，正是新时期县委、县政府的重要职责。
    他们深入农村调查，深切地感到，刚刚摆脱贫困的农民，承受能力还是相当脆弱的。表面上看，人均收入600多元不算低，但用处太多：要添被褥，要置车马，还要拾掇房子……长期以来，家底实在太薄。现在，农民实际上还处在“垫底”的阶段，他们需要保护，需要扶持。
    对农民的状况有了切实的了解之后，县委、县政府确定，协调矛盾的原则是：要按照政策维护农民的合法权益，以调动农民生产的积极性。
    指导思想明确，协调矛盾就有“谱”了。
    黑龙江是我国甜菜糖的生产基地。但是，近年来农民普遍不愿种甜菜，原因是甜菜价低，种着费工，对地力破坏也比较严重。肇州县里有2家糖厂，每年需加工甜菜18万吨，也就是全县每年要保证种甜菜15万亩。否则，工厂吃不饱，不仅要亏损，还完不成国家下达的食糖生产任务。县里作了分析，制定出糖厂向农民让利的8条优惠政策，规定种甜菜的贷款利息由糖厂支付；种子半价供给，另一半由糖厂承担；化肥、农药也实行优惠价；为方便农民交甜菜，每个乡设一个收购站，从乡到糖厂的运费，由糖厂承担……这样一来，农民积极性就起来了。1986年以来，肇州县不仅甜菜种植面积有保证，而且产量高，质量好。2家糖厂因此吃得饱，年年盈利。而有些地方的糖厂由于开工不足而亏损。
    1988年，肇州粮食大丰收，尤其是100万亩玉米，平均亩产达到449公斤。而有些县份粮食受灾减产，为此，上级给肇州追加了3000万公斤合同定购任务。当时市场玉米每公斤价格高于国家收购价6分钱左右。接到任务后，肇州县委、县政府没有采取强硬手段，而是向农民交底，讲清兄弟县受灾完不成任务，我们丰收了，要为国家多承担些义务。同时，县里考虑到本县大豆产量没有达到计划，在请示上级后，决定适当减少一些大豆定购任务。农民感到县委、县政府的做法通情达理，只几天，就把3000万公斤玉米交齐了。
    服务：增进理解的桥梁
    肇州县委书记马殿有、县长王国学在和记者交谈时，都深有感触地说，有些矛盾未处理好，与作为国家代表的县一级党政机关为农民服务不够、工作不周有关。他们认为，国家对农民的政策，要通过县上的服务去落实，农民对国家的要求，也同样需要通过县上的服务来满足。农民分散经营后，有些事情办起来有困难，我们不提供服务，他们就会有意见。因此，服务是协调国家与农民利益的环节，是融洽农民与国家关系的媒介。服务工作做好了，不少矛盾会迎刃而解。
    化肥，是这些年令农民犯愁的生产资料。一是数量少，二是不及时，三是价格高。肇州每年需要化肥10万标准吨，而国家只能拨给4万标准吨。县委、县政府急农民所急，要求县乡有关部门提前八九个月动手，采购来年要用的化肥，贮存、损耗的费用，全由县财政承担，县里每年要为此拿出20来万元，到来年开春化肥送到农户，则一分钱不涨。因而，这些年肇州农民没被化肥难住，而且亩施化肥由20标准公斤提高到50标准公斤。
    玉米是肇州的主要农作物。长期以来，全县玉米单产超不过200公斤。县委、县政府把玉米专家请来研究，在7户农家搞试验，以后又搞万亩攻关，逐步摸索出了“好种子，大密度，高投入”的玉米高产路子。经验成熟后，各乡村利用冬季给农民上课，春夏季又一步一步地教，农民照着做，产量翻着番地提高了。近两年，玉米亩产八九百公斤的农户大批涌现。
    在肇州，农民自己外出采购种子是“违法”的，县人大制定了有关法规，规定种子一律由县上统一供给，保证既好又纯。农药也是，为防止农民上当，也统一由县里采购、供应。
    为减轻农民负担，今年春天，县里发出“安民告示”明确农民应负担的费用项目，凡超出规定的，一律视为乱摊派，农民有权拒绝。至于兴办乡镇企业，县委、县政府更是跑前跑后，精心服务。去年这个各方面条件都比较差的县，乡镇企业总产值超过1.4亿元，获利1300万元，比1987年增长62％。
