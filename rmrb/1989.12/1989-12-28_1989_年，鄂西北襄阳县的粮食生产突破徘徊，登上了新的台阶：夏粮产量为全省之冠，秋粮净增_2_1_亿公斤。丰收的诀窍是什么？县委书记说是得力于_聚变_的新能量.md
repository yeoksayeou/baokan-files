In 1989, Xianyang County in northwestern Hubei Province broke through the stagnation in grain production and reached a new level: the summer grain yield was the highest in the province, and the autumn grain yield increased by 210 million kilograms. What was the secret to this bumper harvest? The county party secretary attributed it to the new energy of "fusion."

In the northwestern part of Hubei Province, there is Xianyang County, with a population of 1 million farmers and 174,000 hectares of cultivated land. In 1989, Xianyang County had a bumper harvest: the total grain yield reached 8.5 billion kilograms, setting a new historical record.

Where was the "secret" to this bumper harvest?

Xianyang County Party Secretary Xu Guorui, who is proficient in agricultural production, told the reporter: "It is the new energy released by 'fusion.'"

The Stagnation After "Fission"

Xianyang County was once a poor county. Ten years ago, the entire county began implementing the "Household Responsibility System," and farmers' enthusiasm for production surged. The county's grain yield increased by an average of 500 million kilograms per year for five consecutive years, reaching 6.58 billion kilograms in 1985.

When summarizing the experience, the former county committee leader used a modern analogy: "The explosion of an atomic bomb is achieved by splitting atomic nuclei, releasing enormous energy; our county's agricultural harvest is achieved by farmers splitting out of the 'big pot' system, generating enormous enthusiasm."

However, stagnation was hidden within this "fission."

During the autumn planting season that year, a superior leader, while investigating the "10,000 mu submerged fields" in Niuchu Town, asked an old farmer: "If you just dig deep ditches to drain the water, you can increase the yield by several hundred kilograms per mu, why don't you dig?" The old man replied: "The fields around us don't dig ditches, the deeper I dig, the more water flows into my field, how can I dig?"

In towns like Shuanggou and Dongjin, tens of thousands of mu of river sand fields were divided into small plots, with the most severe plots having only a meter or so wide per household. Farmers were afraid of damaging their neighbors' crops, so they did not dare to use machines for plowing, and could only use hoes and spades. In Guanmiao Village, Group 2 of Heilongji Town, farmer Wang Minghui's green bean field was flanked by other people's sesame fields. Pests only ate the green beans and not the sesame, flying away when treated and returning after treatment, resulting in almost no green beans being harvested in the autumn...

"To resolve these contradictions, should we go back to the old ways?"

"Going back would only dampen the farmers' enthusiasm, which is not feasible!" the people of Xianyang responded.

How to develop agriculture without returning to the "big pot" system?

After several years of careful exploration in villages and towns like Guanmiao and Zhujie, and bold practice in overcoming the severe drought of 1988, in mid-autumn of 1988, the Xianyang County Committee drew a clear conclusion from their previously vague sensory understanding: the limitations of individual household operations can be overcome by leveraging collective strength and administrative organizational functions. Based on this, they made a "16-character decision" - "Maintain the advantages of farmers' 'division'; leverage the leadership's 'unification' function." This statement may not seem new, but the people of Xianyang had a practical understanding of "unification" and took a series of measures welcomed by farmers.

"Unification" means the leadership pays renewed attention to agriculture. The county committee divided the 28 towns into 6 "battle zones," with the county party secretary, county magistrate, people's congress chairman, and CPPCC chairman, along with their deputies, serving as "commanders" in each "battle zone." The leaders of each town also took on the responsibility of managing specific areas and villages. During the autumn plowing, while ensuring that the boundary markers of each household's fields remained unchanged, they unified the planting sequence, unified mechanized plowing, and the small plots were restored to large fields; during fertilization, based on the soil and fertilizer station's data for different cultivated lands, they mandated that even those who were lazy about fertilizing, did not believe in science, or had no money to buy fertilizer, all applied fertilizer according to the standard...

"Unification" means strengthening technical guidance for farmers. All agricultural cadres and plant protection personnel in the county went to the production front lines. During the hybrid rice seed production and pollination period this year, which coincided with the hottest "three scorching days," some technical leaders and professional technicians rolled up their pants and went into the fields, teaching farmers pollination techniques hand-in-hand.

"Unification" means sincerely serving the farmers. In response to the previous few years' trend of "every industry seeking profits, all at the expense of farmers," County Party Secretary Xu Guorui emphasized at a meeting of county-level cadres: "We eat the food provided by the farmers! In the future, if anyone exploits or neglects the farmers, they will be demoted to work as a clerk in a town or township, experiencing the bittersweet of agricultural work!" In mid-April this year, when wheat powdery mildew occurred, the leaders of the county's supply and marketing cooperative drove 750 kilometers, purchasing a truckload of "golden mold" from Wuhan within 24 hours. In less than two days, this batch of medicine was sprayed on the fields.

The "Fusion" After the Decision

The summer harvest came, and Xianyang was golden. At the "National Summer Grain Production Field Conference" held in Xiangfan City, when visiting Xianyang County's contiguous high-yield fields, a vice minister of the Ministry of Agriculture encouraged the county: "So far, there has been no county in the country with a summer grain yield of 4 billion kilograms, you strive to win this championship." Later, due to several rainstorms and a flood, 200 million kilograms of grain were destroyed, and the national championship was not won, but the total summer grain yield still reached 3.9 billion kilograms, making it the highest in the province!

The autumn harvest came, and Xianyang's "gold" was everywhere. Experts from the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry came to appraise the "contiguous planting, model cultivation 10,000 mu experimental fields"; after the appraisal, they signed: "All meet the requirements." The autumn grain was harvested, and a series of figures came out: the total yield was 4.6 billion kilograms, an increase of 2.1 billion kilograms compared to the previous year!

Summarizing this success, Xu Guorui used another modern analogy: "Just as combining hydrogen nuclei can explode a hydrogen bomb with greater power than an atomic bomb, unifying farmers who have divided land can produce greater production benefits than at the beginning of the reform."

The reporter witnessed many details of this "fusion" in Xianyang County:

In Mogang Village, Jupo Township, the village party secretary, Wan Jiulai, presented the following facts: this year, the entire village unified ten production links such as seed selection, fertilizer preparation, pest control, and water use, and farmers saved a lot of trouble just in "pest control." More than 95% of households reduced the randomness and error rate of pest control. This year, the village's grain yield reached a historical high, achieving "10,000 kilograms of grain per household."

In Zhujie Village, Zhujie Town, the village agricultural station director, Qi Huayu, provided the following data: the entire village unified the purchase and distribution of seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers, saving at least 4,500 "purchase labor days" compared to farmers purchasing individually.

"Can Xianyang County's bumper harvest experience be summarized as just one word, 'unification'?" we asked County Party Secretary Xu Guorui at the end of the interview.

He smiled and shook his head, saying: "It can't be said that way. There are two points that should be particularly noted. During the people's commune era, wasn't it also highly 'unified,' but why were people's stomachs not full, and now 'unification' produces benefits? The key is that farmers' enthusiasm and creativity after the 'Household Responsibility System' serve as the foundation, without which talking about 'unification' will not be effective. Second, the content of 'unification' is extensive, summarized in one point, it is to improve services, let farmers taste the sweetness, rather than coercion and command, violating economic laws, and trying to dominate everything."

    1989年，鄂西北襄阳县的粮食生产突破徘徊，登上了新的台阶：夏粮产量为全省之冠，秋粮净增2.1亿公斤。丰收的诀窍是什么？县委书记说是得力于——
    “聚变”的新能量
    朱道钰　詹金生
    湖北省的西北部，有个100万农业人口、174万亩耕地的襄阳县。1989年，襄阳县大丰收：粮食总产达8.5亿公斤，创造历史最高纪录。
    丰收的“诀窍”在哪里？
    精于农业生产的襄阳县委书记许国富，告诉笔者：“是‘聚变’爆发了新的能量。”
          “裂变”后的困顿
    襄阳县过去是个穷县。10年前全县开始实行“大包干”，农民的生产积极性迸发出来。全县粮食产量连续5年平均年递增0.5亿公斤，1985年达到6.58亿公斤。
    在总结经验时，原县委负责人用了一个现代比喻：“原子弹爆炸，是靠分裂一个一个的原子核，释放出了巨大的能量；我们县的农业丰收，是靠广大农民从‘大锅饭’中分裂出来而产生的巨大积极性。”
    然而，“裂变”中却蕴藏着困顿。
    这年秋播时节，一位上级负责人在泥咀镇的“万亩冷浸田”调查时，问一位老农：“只要挖深沟排掉积水，一亩就可多收几百斤粮食，你为啥不挖呢？”老汉回答：“周围各户的田都不挖沟，我挖得越深，水往我的田里流得越多，我哪能挖呢！”
    双沟、东津等乡镇几十万亩河沙地上，许多近百亩的大方田被种成了零碎地，最严重的地块，每户仅种一米多宽。农户怕伤着邻居的庄稼，不敢机耕牛耙，只好锹挖锄铲。黑龙集镇关庙村二组农民王明会的绿豆地两边，是别人种的芝麻。害虫专吃绿豆，不咬芝麻，治时飞走，治后又来，秋后绿豆差点绝收。……
    “为了解决这些矛盾，再退回去行吗？”
    “那样会重新挫伤农民的积极性，使不得！”被问及的襄阳人都这样回答。
    又要发展农业，又不能重吃“大锅饭”，怎么办？
    困顿后的决策
    经过几年在关庙村、朱集镇等村镇的小心探索，又经过战胜1988年特大干旱的大胆实践。1988年中秋，襄阳县委从原先不很清晰的感性认识中，悟出一个非常清晰的结论：单门独户经营的局限性可以通过发挥集体力量和行政组织功能，予以克服。由此，他们做出了一个“16字决策”——“保持农民‘分’的优势；发挥领导‘统’的功能。”这个提法似乎不新，但是，襄阳人对“统”有着自己实在的理解，并采取了一系列为农民所欢迎的措施。
    “统”就是领导重新重视农业。县委将全县28个乡镇划分为6个“战区”，县委书记、县长、人大主任、政协主席及其副职们，分别在各“战区”担任“司令官”。各乡镇的负责干部也纷纷包片包村。秋耕时，在保证农户地头界桩不动的情况下，统一茬口，统一机耕，零碎地又回复为大方田；施肥时，根据县土肥站对不同耕地的测肥数据，不论是懒得上肥的，不信科学的，无钱买肥的，统统指令性地让其按标准施足肥料……
    “统”就是加强对农民的技术指导。全县所有农业干部和植保人员，纷纷走向生产第一线。今年杂交稻制种授粉期间，正赶上最热的“三伏天”。一些懂技术的领导以及专业技术人员卷起裤腿下到田里，手把手地教农民授粉。
    “统”就是实心实意为农民服务。针对前几年刮起的“各行各业讲效益，都在农民头上打主意”的歪风，县委书记许国富在县直机关干部大会上强调：“我们吃的是农民给的一碗饭！今后发现谁要坑农轻农，非让你下到乡镇当个办事干部，尝尝抓农业的酸甜苦辣不可！”今年4月中旬，小麦发生白粉病，县生资公司领导驱车750公里，在24小时之内，从武汉买回一卡车“金刚霉素”。不到两天，这批药及时地喷洒在农田里。
    决策后的“聚变”
    夏收了，襄阳大地遍地金黄。在襄樊市召开“全国夏粮生产现场会议”，参观襄阳县连片种植的高产田时，农业部一位副部长鼓励该县：“全国至今还没有发现夏粮生产达到4亿公斤的县，你们争取夺这个冠军”。后来因为几次暴雨和一场洪水，毁掉粮食0.2亿公斤，全国冠军没有夺成，但夏粮总产仍然达到3.9亿公斤，成为全省之冠！
    秋收了，襄阳县“黄金”遍地。湖北省农牧厅的专家，赶来鉴定“连片种植、模式栽培万亩试验田”了；鉴定结束，挥笔签字：“全部达到要求”。秋粮登场，一串数字出来：总产4.6亿公斤，比去年净增2.1亿公斤！
    总结这一次成功，许国富又用了一个现代比喻：“正像把一个个氢原子核聚合拢来可以爆炸比原子弹威力更大的氢弹一样，把一个个分地到户的农民‘统一’起来，可以产生出比改革之初更大的生产效益。”
    笔者在襄阳县耳闻目睹了大量的“聚变”细节：
    在朱坡乡莫岗村，村支书万久来摆出了这样的事实：今年全村把选种、备肥、治虫、用水等十几个生产环节“统”起来后，农民单是
  “治虫”就省了大事。95％以上的农户减少了治虫的盲目性和失误率。今年该村粮食产量创历史最高纪录，达到“户均生产万斤粮”。
    在朱集镇的朱集村，村农经站长齐华玉提供了这样的数据：全村将种子、农药、化肥统一购回分发，比农民各自外出采购，一年节省的“购买工日”至少在4500个以上。
    “襄阳县大丰收的经验，是不是就能归结为一个‘统’字呢？”采访结束时，我们问县委书记许国富。
    他笑着摇摇头，说：“不能这样说。有两点特别应该注意。人民公社时不也是‘统’得很多，为什么肚子就吃不饱，而现在‘统’就会产生效益，关键是有‘大包干’后农民的积极性和创造力作为基础，离开这点谈‘统’，不会有效果。第二，‘统’的内容很多，归结一点，就是搞好服务，让农民从中尝到甜头，而不是强迫命令，违背经济规律，包打天下。”
