It aims to cultivate a new generation of young people who are idealistic, moral, cultured, and disciplined. Despite the neglect of political theory books, the press has published over 100 such books. Some of these outstanding works have been well-received by experts and readers, such as "Popular Philosophy," which has sold 2.48 million copies. Their publications, including "Twelve Lectures on Youth Cultivation" and "Casual Talks on Life," have played a positive role in the healthy growth of young people.

The press also emphasizes patriotism and revolutionary tradition education for young people. It actively publishes biographies of outstanding figures and historical readings, providing role models for young people to learn from. Books such as "Biographies of Outstanding Figures of the Chinese Nation," "Zhou Enlai's Life," and "The Sea—In Memory of Comrade Zhu De" have resonated greatly among young people.
