To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Professor Chen Mingxian of Renmin University of China has compiled and authored "Forty Years of New China," which has been published by the China Workers' Publishing House.

The book, based on the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic" and the theory of the primary stage of socialism, systematically discusses the arduous and tortuous journey and extraordinary social changes that the young republic has undergone over the past 40 years. It focuses on explaining the Party's lines, policies, and guidelines in various historical periods, and comprehensively showcases the political, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, and diplomatic aspects of the republic. It introduces the tremendous achievements and experiences gained in China's socialist construction, and also objectively evaluates the setbacks and mistakes that the Party and the state have encountered in certain areas.
