Today, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government held a send-off ceremony for 829 cadres who are going to the grassroots level to conduct ideological education. The officials emphasized that from ordinary cadres to section chiefs, bureau chiefs, and department heads, everyone should carry their own luggage and stay in rural villages and factories. They should truly live and eat with the workers and farmers, become their trusted friends, and serve as propagandists and servants of the people.

To promptly propagate and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee has planned to conduct education on stabilizing policies and people's minds in rural villages, factories, and vast pastoral areas in the coming winter and spring in two phases. The first batch of personnel going down to the grassroots level comes from 71 provincial-level units, including 61 cadres at the deputy department level and above, and 178 cadres at the section level. The Provincial Party Committee requires everyone to go down and boost the morale of the farmers and enterprise employees, encouraging farmers to firmly adhere to the socialist path, boldly and confidently develop production, and strive to become wealthy through hard work, making greater contributions to agricultural development. They should also guide enterprise employees to explore potential, overcome difficulties, deepen reforms, and improve efficiency. At the same time, they should help rural villages and enterprises prepare for production this winter and next spring.
