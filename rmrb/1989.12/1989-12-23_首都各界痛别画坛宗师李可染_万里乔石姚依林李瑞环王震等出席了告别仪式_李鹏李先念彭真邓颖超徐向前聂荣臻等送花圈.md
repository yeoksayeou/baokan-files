Today, more than 700 people from various circles in the capital braved the snow to gather at the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery in Baobao Mountain, to bid a sorrowful farewell to Li Keran, a master of Chinese painting, an outstanding people's art educator, and an excellent representative of the cultural world.

Li Keran's body lay in a bed of flowers, covered with a bright red flag, fulfilling his lifelong wish to express his sincere devotion to his country, his people, and his art.

Amid the mournful music, leaders such as Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, Chen Xilian, Huang Hua, Fang Yi, Gu Mu, Kang Keqing, Cheng Siyuan, and Wang Feng paid their respects to this great artist who had made immense contributions to Chinese art.

Wreaths were sent by Li Peng, Li Xiannian, Peng Zhen, Deng Yingchao, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Li Tieming, Wu Xueqian, Song Renqiong, Wu Xiuquan, Li Desheng, Yang Dezhi, Xiao Ke, Zhang Aiping, Lu Dingyi, Hu Qiaomu, Duan Junyi, Xi Zhongxun, Apu Awangjinmei, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Zhou Peiyuan, Zhao Puji, Qian Weichang, Simayi Aimaiti, Chutu Nan, Yang Chengwu, and others.

Wreaths were also sent by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Personnel, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the municipal government, Xinhua News Agency, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the China Artists Association, the China International Cultural Exchange Center, and the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the municipal government.

Li Keran was born in 1907 in a commoner's family in Xuzhou, Jiangsu. At the age of 13, he began studying painting under the local scholar Qian Shizi, thus embarking on a 70-year artistic journey. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Li Keran dedicated his entire life to the innovation of Chinese painting. Starting in 1954, he broke away from the conservative trends in the art world, bravely venturing into life and seeking new directions for Chinese landscape painting. He traveled over 100,000 li, carrying his painting tools, climbing mountains, and crossing rivers to sketch and create across the country, ultimately infusing new life into the ancient art of landscape painting. His works, deep and profound, vast and majestic, with a distinct spirit of the times and artistic individuality, promoted the transformation and elevation of national traditional painting, becoming a milestone in the history of Chinese painting.

For over half a century, Li Keran always linked his art with the fate of his country and people. In his youth, he joined progressive art groups. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he enthusiastically created propaganda paintings for the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement. After liberation, he used his brush to praise his country and depict new life, often saying, "Every mountain and river is the embodiment of our country. I am using my brush to write the biography of our country's rivers and mountains."

Li Keran lived a frugal life until his death, still wearing a worn-out sweater, shoes, and coarse cloth. However, he selflessly donated his numerous masterpieces to the country and society. Recently, he donated $100,000, which was given to him by foreign friends for academic purposes, to the Second China Art Festival Foundation. Just days before his death, he instructed his family to quickly send 100,000 yuan to the Ma Haide Foundation to fulfill his long-held wish to contribute to the eradication of leprosy.

Representatives from relevant departments, including He Jingzhi, Zhu Muzhi, Lin Moquan, and Song Desen, as well as renowned figures in the art world such as Hua Junwu, Ye Qianyu, Cai Ruohong, Gu Yuan, Wu Guanzhong, Zhang Dacian, Huang Zhou, Shao Yu, Fan Zeng, Jin Shangyi, Han Meilin, and Zhou Sicong, attended the farewell ceremony.

    首都各界痛别画坛宗师李可染
    万里乔石姚依林李瑞环王震等出席了告别仪式
　  李鹏李先念彭真邓颖超徐向前聂荣臻等送花圈
    据新华社北京12月22日电（记者尹鸿祝、通讯员任愚颖）今天，首都各界人士700余人冒雪聚集在八宝山革命公墓礼堂，沉痛告别中国画坛一代宗师、杰出的人民艺术教育家、文化界的优秀代表李可染先生。
    李可染先生的遗体安卧在鲜花丛中，身上覆盖着一面鲜艳的红旗。这是可染老人生前的遗愿，以表明他对祖国、人民和艺术事业的一片赤诚之心。
    哀乐声中，万里、乔石、姚依林、李瑞环、王震、陈锡联、黄华、方毅、谷牧、康克清、程思远、汪锋等领导同志，向这位为中国美术事业做出巨大贡献的艺术家默哀告别。
    李鹏、李先念、彭真、邓颖超、徐向前、聂荣臻、李铁映、吴学谦、宋任穷、伍修权、李德生、杨得志、肖克、张爱萍、陆定一、胡乔木、段君毅、习仲勋、阿沛·阿旺晋美、孙起孟、雷洁琼、周培源、赵朴初、钱伟长、司马义·艾买提、楚图南、杨成武等送了花圈。
    全国政协、中央统战部、中央宣传部、文化部、人事部、中共北京市委和市政府、新华通讯社、全国文联、中国美术家协会、中国国际文化交流中心和中共徐州市委、市政府等部门送的花圈也陈放在悼念大厅内。
    李可染于1907年出生于江苏徐州一个平民家庭，13岁从师乡贤钱食芝习画，从此走上了长达70年的艺术道路。新中国成立以后，李可染把整个身心投入到中国画艺术的革新。从1954年起，他冲破画坛陈陈相因的保守画风，勇敢地走向生活，寻求中国山水画新的出路。为此，他身背画具，跋山涉水10万余里，到祖国各地写生创作，终于为古老的山水画注入了生机。他的作品深厚凝重、博大沉雄，以鲜明的时代精神和艺术个性促进了民族传统绘画的嬗变与升华，成为中国画发展史上划时代的里程碑。
    半个多世纪以来，李可染始终把他的艺术同祖国和人民的命运紧紧联系在一起。青年时代，他投身于进步的美术团体，抗日战争时期，又以满腔热忱从事抗日救亡宣传画的创作。解放后，他用画笔赞颂祖国、描画新生活，常说“山山水水，祖国之谓也。我是在用画笔为祖国河山立传”。
    李可染在俭朴的生活中度过了他的一生，直到他逝世时，还穿着快要磨破的毛衣、鞋和粗布衣衫。然而，他却把创作的大量佳作无私地奉献给国家和社会。不久前，他还把国外友人送他用作学术基金的10万美元捐赠给第二届中国艺术节基金会。逝世前几日，他又嘱咐家人要尽快把10万元人民币送到马海德基金会，以实现自己“为消灭麻风病尽些义务”的宿愿。
    有关部门的负责人贺敬之、朱穆之、林默涵、宋德敏以及美术界的知名人士华君武、叶浅予、蔡若虹、古元、吴冠中、张仃、黄胄、邵宇、范曾、靳尚谊、韩美林、周思聪等参加了告别仪式。
