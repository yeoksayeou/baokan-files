“One rabbit, oil, salt, and vinegar; three rabbits, wealth; ten rabbits, a household with ten thousand yuan.” This is a folk rhyme from Lufeng County, Hebei Province. When it comes to this, people naturally praise—

“White Rabbit King” Zhao Yansong

In the autumn of 1984, Zhao Yansong voluntarily gave up his “iron rice bowl” and returned to his hometown in Lufeng County, Lufeng Town, Hebei Province, to start a long-haired rabbit breeding farm. At that time, the countryside was experiencing a significant drop in rabbit fur prices, leading to a wave of rabbit culling. Why did Xiao Zhao go against the trend? It turned out that he had a different idea, thinking that the less others did, the more likely he was to succeed. However, his calculations were wrong, and after only a year and a half, the long-haired rabbit breeding farm could no longer continue.

Was it really that “a rabbit’s tail can’t grow long”?!

Zhao Yansong was not willing to give up. He spent an entire year conducting research and confirmed that rabbits, which mainly feed on grass, have great potential in China. However, the previous method of individual households breeding rabbits in a chaotic manner had too much randomness and could not adapt to market changes. Only by adopting new organizational and breeding methods could the rabbit industry thrive. In February 1987, with the support of the Lufeng County Science and Technology Commission, the 30-year-old Zhao Yansong established the Lufeng County Economic Animal Breeding United Service Company according to his own design, taking on the role of general manager, determined to “rise again” and pioneer a new breeding industry.

Soon, Xiao Zhao received important information: the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, had successfully bred a superior rabbit breed: the White Rabbit, which had just passed the appraisal and was ready for promotion. This breed grows and reproduces quickly, with a single adult female rabbit capable of producing 36 to 54 offspring per year; the fur quality is excellent, and the meat is also good, generally weighing 5 to 6 kilograms, with the heaviest reaching 10 kilograms, almost like a small sheep. This is a large skin and meat dual-purpose rabbit breed developed by Chinese experts Zhang Junfeng and others over more than a decade, and it is China’s first superior rabbit breed that can “go global,” winning the second-class scientific and technological progress award from the Ministry of Agriculture and the “Golden Cup Award” in the 1987 National Rabbit Breeding Competition.

However, due to the drawbacks in the research and promotion system, rabbit breeding experts found it difficult to promote their achievements on a large scale. It was at this time that Zhao Yansong stepped forward, deciding to open up a new promotion path. He learned from past lessons and adopted a method where the company and breeders shared risks and benefits, mobilizing the masses to breed and promote the White Rabbit, and ensuring that the majority of the profits went to the breeders.

The breeding company sold White Rabbit breeding pairs weighing over one kilogram each at a price of 180 yuan per pair to farmers willing to raise them. The breeders bred the offspring according to the requirements, and once they reached the standard weight, the company would act as an agent to sell them, paying the breeders 60% of the sales revenue, which is 108 yuan per pair. Generally, breeders could earn over 1,000 yuan in pure income per pair of White Rabbits per year, with the highest earning over 2,000 yuan.

The breeding company not only provided breeding pairs and purchased offspring but also offered technical support, disease prevention and treatment, feed supply, and other comprehensive services, and regularly trained breeders. To facilitate the introduction and breeding of White Rabbits by farmers in the county and across the province, they established over 80 offices nationwide and published 25,000 copies of the “White Rabbit Breeding and Management Technology” booklet. Each office served as a service center, linking a large number of breeders nearby and helping them solve breeding problems.

Farmer Li Shengwei from Dannihe Village, Luzhuang Town, Lufeng County, bought 10 female White Rabbits from the breeding company. Due to poor management, several of them died in a short period, causing him to cry in frustration.

Upon learning of this, Zhao Yansong visited his home twice to teach him the techniques, quickly helping this breeder master the skills, and earning over 10,000 yuan in income within a year. In just over a year, Xiao Zhao’s company had taken off, supplying over 70,000 White Rabbit breeding pairs to more than 10,000 breeders nationwide, recovering over 600,000 offspring, and helping breeders earn over 30 million yuan. Among them, over 1,000 breeders earned over 10,000 yuan per year, and over 3,000 households of farmers were lifted out of poverty within a year. At the same time, the company created nearly 300 million yuan in taxes.

Currently, Zhao Yansong is in charge of over 30,000 base female White Rabbits and can breed over 600,000 young rabbits this year. The largest state-owned rabbit breeding farm in China has fewer than 1,000 base female rabbits. In comparison, Zhao Yansong can indeed be called the “White Rabbit King”! Seeing the superior rabbit breed being promoted so quickly, rabbit breeding experts were overjoyed.

Of course, Xiao Zhao also understood that there would be a day when the supply of White Rabbit breeding pairs would be saturated. According to expert predictions, with the current promotion speed, this relative saturation time would be in four to five years. What will happen in four to five years? This is what breeders are concerned about. Zhao Yansong calculated for them that after the general White Rabbit breeding pairs are turned into commercial rabbits, a base female rabbit can still earn 400 to 500 yuan per year, much higher than raising pigs for meat. To ensure that breeders’ commercial rabbits are purchased as much as possible, Zhao Yansong is planning to expand the rabbit meat processing plant and establish a fur processing plant. He also wants to set up a rabbit breeding technology training center, build 50 standardized breeding rooms, and form a “one-stop” service for White Rabbit breeding, training, processing, and export.

Zhao Yansong’s “White Rabbit Rapid Breeding and Promotion Technology” and its achievements have been valued by relevant leaders from the National Science and Technology Commission, Hebei Provincial Science and Technology Commission, and Qinhuangdao City. Recently, this technology passed the appraisal of the Hebei Provincial “Spark Program” project achievements. Some foreign businesses have also actively proposed cooperation with him. Zhao Yansong is full of confidence in his White Rabbit “trust.”

    “一只兔，油盐醋；三只兔，能致富；十只兔，万元户”。这是河北省抚宁县流传着的一个顺口溜。说起它，人们自然要夸——
    “哈白兔王”赵岩松
    纪曙春
    1984年秋天，赵岩松自愿放弃“铁饭碗”，回到家乡河北省抚宁县抚宁镇，办起了长毛兔养殖场。当时农村正因兔毛大跌价而大刮宰兔子风。小赵为什么顶风上呢？原来，他另有心眼，以为，越是别人不搞的，越有可能搞成功。可是，他的算盘打错了，只干了一年多，长毛兔养殖场就办不下去了。
    难道真是“兔子尾巴长不了”吗？！
    赵岩松不服输。他搞了整整一年的调查研究，确认，兔以食草为主，在我国大有发展前途，但以往那种一哄而起，单家独户的饲养法，盲目性太大，很难适应市场的需求变化，只有采取新的组织、养殖方式，才能保证养兔业长盛不衰。1987年2月，在抚宁县科委的支持下，刚满30岁的赵岩松按自己的设计创建了抚宁县经济动物养殖联合服务公司，自任公司总经理，决心“东山再起”，开辟新型的养殖事业。
    不久，小赵得到一条重要信息：中国农科院哈尔滨兽医研究所培育出的一种优良兔种：哈白兔，刚刚通过鉴定，正待推广。这种兔，生长发育快，繁殖率高，一只成年母兔，一年可以产仔36只—54只；皮毛质量好，肉质也不错，一般可达5—6公斤，最高可以长到10公斤，简直像只小绵羊。这是我国专家张军飞等人用了十几年功夫，培育成功的一种大型皮肉兼用兔，也是我国第一个能够“走向世界”的优良兔种，荣获农业部颁发的科技进步二等奖和1987年全国种兔大赛“金杯奖”。
  可是，由于科研和推广体制中的弊病，养兔专家很难把自己的成果大面积推广。就在这个时候，赵岩松找上门了，决定开创一条新的推广之路。他吸取以往的教训，采取公司和养殖户共担风险、共同受益的办法，发动群众繁育、推广“哈白兔”，并保证把收益的大头让给养殖户。
    养殖公司把体重一公斤多的哈白兔种兔，以每对180元的价格卖给愿意饲养的农户，养殖户按要求繁育仔兔，长到标准体重后，按照合同，由公司代理销售，每对支付给养殖户60％卖兔款，也就是108元。一般养殖户每饲养一对哈白兔，每年可以通过繁育仔兔获得1000多元的纯收入，最高的能获纯利2000多元。
    养殖公司不光提供种兔、收购仔兔，还提供养殖技术、防病治病、饲料供应等配套服务，并定期对养殖户进行培训。为了方便县和省内外农民引进和饲养哈白兔，他们在全国建立了80多个办事处，还印发了2.5万本《哈白兔饲养管理技术》小册子。每个办事处，都是个服务中心，周围联络着一大批养殖户，就近帮助他们解决饲养中的难题。
    抚宁县卢王庄乡大泥河村农民李胜伟从养殖公司买了10只母兔，由于管理不当，没几天就死了好几只，急得直哭。
    赵岩松得知后，两次前往他家传授技术，使这位养殖户很快摸熟了门道，一年收入超过万元。仅一年多时间，小赵的公司就“发”了起来，已向全国十几个省市1万多家养殖户供应哈白种兔7万多只，回收仔兔60多万只，养殖户由此增收3000多万元，其中1000多养殖户年收入超万元，3000多户农民一年脱贫，同时，公司创利税近300万元。
    目前，赵岩松已“统率”着3万多只哈白兔基础母兔，今年可以繁殖幼兔60多万只。我国最大的国营种兔场才拥有不到1000只基础母兔，相比之下，赵岩松真可算是一位“哈白兔大王”啦！看到优良兔种这么快就推广开来，养兔专家心里别提多高兴了。
    当然，小赵也明白，哈白兔种兔总有一天会饱和的，据专家预测，按照目前的推广速度，这种相对饱和的时间还有四五年。四五年后怎么办？这正是养殖户们所关心的。赵岩松为他们算了一笔帐，在一般哈白兔成兔转为商品兔之后，一只基础母兔每年收益仍可达到400元至500元，比养肉猪的收益高得多。为了把养殖户的商品成兔都尽可能收购上来，赵岩松正谋划着扩建兔肉加工厂、兴办皮毛加工厂的事。他还想办起一个养兔技术培训中心，建起50间标准化饲养车间，形成哈白兔的引种、培训、加工、出口“一条龙”。
    赵岩松的“哈白兔快速繁育推广技术”及其成果受到国家科委、河北省科委和秦皇岛市有关领导同志的重视，最近这项技术通过了河北省“星火计划”项目成果鉴定。一些外商也主动提出与他合作。赵岩松对他的哈白兔“托拉斯”充满信心。
