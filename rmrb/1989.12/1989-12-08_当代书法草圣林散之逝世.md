	Contemporary calligraphy master Lin Sanzhi, renowned as the "grass saint" of our time, passed away at 8:30 AM today at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. He was 92 years old.

	Lin Sanzhi lived a life of simplicity and dedication, devoting himself to the study of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He was known by the self-given name "Three Fools."

    当代书法草圣林散之逝世
    新华社南京12月6日电　（记者古平）被誉为当代“草圣”的著名书法家林散之，今天上午8时30分在南京鼓楼医院病逝，终年92岁。
    林散之一生淡泊自甘，潜力研究诗书画艺术，自号“三痴”。其书法作品蜚声海内外。日本书道界曾有人将林散之的作品误以为是唐代草圣张旭流传至今的真迹。《林散之书法选集》、《江上诗存》以及难以计数的墨宝是散之老人对社会主义祖国文化宝库的奉献。
