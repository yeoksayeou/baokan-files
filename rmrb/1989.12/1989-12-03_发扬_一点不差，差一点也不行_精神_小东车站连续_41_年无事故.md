Xiaodong Railway Station Maintains 41 Years Without Accidents

The spirit of "not a bit off, even a little bit off is not allowed" has made Xiaodong Railway Station famous nationwide. By 18:00 yesterday, Xiaodong Station had maintained 41 consecutive years without any accidents, holding the highest safety record among the more than 5,000 stations nationwide.

Xiaodong Station is a fourth-class station on the Shenyang to Fuxin railway line. From the day it received its first safety commendation certificate on August 5, 1949, to November 25 this year when it was awarded the title of "National Railway Advanced Collective," the station has received 340 commendation certificates, 43 banners, 11 honor plaques, and 5 trophies.

The glorious history of Xiaodong Station began on December 1, 1948. On that day, amidst the gunfire of the War of Liberation, the station resumed operations. At that time, switches were manually operated, and the two horizontal and vertical "pulling knives" had to be precisely aligned. Practice taught the people of Xiaodong that operating switches required "not a bit off," and for other train-related equipment and work, "even a little bit off is not allowed." Thus, the spirit of "not a bit off, even a little bit off is not allowed" was passed down.

Compared to the outdated production facilities of the past, Xiaodong Station has undergone six upgrades, completely transforming its appearance. However, they still adhere to strict standards. Normally, rules are strictly enforced, and everyone is meticulous; in emergencies, off-duty staff immediately report to the station, doubling the safety factor with two people per post. The current station master, Tian Bingheng, continues the tradition of his predecessors, insisting on being present at "five scenes": present during shunting operations, present during construction blockades, present during power outages, present during bad weather, and present during critical moments. Under Tian's leadership, all station staff ensure "four ones" during their shifts: remaining at their posts without leaving for a moment, following procedures without missing a step, monitoring operations meticulously, and using standard language without a single error. Due to their strict adherence to regulations, they have prevented three "signal reset" accidents this year alone.

The people of Xiaodong today understand that achieving safe production requires not only the responsibility of "not a bit off" but also the technical skills of "not a bit off." To imbue the spirit of "not a bit off" with new meaning, they summarized the long-term rules of safe production, conducted extensive research and discussion, and produced a 20,000-word "Intermediate Station Management Method." This is the first such management method for intermediate stations on Chinese railways, and after modifications by the Ministry of Railways, it was promoted nationwide, leading safe production towards modern management. Now, the 17 staff members of the station voluntarily study regulations and practice skills, each becoming a "master of one."

### 发扬“一点不差，差一点也不行”精神  小东车站连续41年无事故

    发扬“一点不差，差一点也不行”精神
    小东车站连续41年无事故
    本报沈阳12月2日电　以“一点不差，差一点也不行”精神而闻名全国铁路的小东车站，到昨日18点，连续41年没有发生任何事故，在全国5000多个车站中一直保持着安全最高纪录。
    小东车站，是沈阳至阜新铁路线上的一个四等车站。从1949年8月5日获得第一张安全立功奖状起，到今年11月25日获得“全国铁路先进集体”光荣称号止，他们共获奖状340张、奖旗43面、光荣牌11块、奖杯5个。
    小东车站的光荣史册，是从1948年12月1日掀开第一页的。那一天，在解放战争的炮火中，车站恢复了运营。那时，道岔靠人去扳动，横竖两个“拉刀口”必须对准。实践使小东人体会到：扳道岔要“一点不差”，对其他行车设备以及与行车有关的工作，“差一点也不行”。就这样，“一点不差，差一点也不行”的精神传了下来。
    与当年那落后的生产设施相比，小东站的设备经过六次更新，已面貌大变，但他们仍坚持严格要求。平时，制度严格，人人一丝不苟；遇到非常情况，休班职工马上到站，一个岗位两人干，保险系数增加了一倍。现任站长田炳恒继承前任的传统，每天坚持“五到场”：有调车作业必到场，施工封锁必到场，停电必到场，恶劣天气必到场，关键时刻必到场。在田站长的带动下，全站职工当班时坚持做到“四个一”：坚守岗位一刻不离、按章操作一项不漏、监视运行一丝不苟、标准用语一字不差，由于认真执行规章，仅今年以来就防止“信号复起”等事故3起。
    当代小东人深知，实现安全生产不仅要有“一点不差”的责任感，而且要有“一点不差”的工作技能。为了使“一点不差”的精神赋于新的内涵，他们总结了长期安全生产的规律，经过反复研究讨论，一部2万多字的《中间站管理办法》在小东车站问世了。这是我国铁路第一部中间站管理办法，经铁道部修改后推广到全路，使安全生产走向现代化管理的轨道。现在车站的17名职工，自觉学规章、练技能，人人都成为“一手精”。（孟军）
