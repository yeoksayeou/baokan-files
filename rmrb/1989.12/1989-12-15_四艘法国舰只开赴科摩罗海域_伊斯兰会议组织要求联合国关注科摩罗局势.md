Four French Vessels Head to the Waters off the Comoros
Islamic Conference Organization Urges UN to Focus on Comoros Situation

New Delhi, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) According to a report from the Tunis African News Agency today, the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference Organization, Hamad Al-Abed, has sent a telegram to the United Nations regarding the situation in the Comoros.

In telegrams sent to the UN Secretary-General, the President of the 44th UN General Assembly, and the permanent representatives of Islamic Conference Organization member states to the UN, Al-Abed said that since the assassination of Comoros President Ahmed Abdallah on November 26, mercenaries have seized state power, suspended constitutional institutions, taken the entire population hostage, and created a dangerous and unacceptable situation in the Comoros.

He called on the representatives of Islamic countries to the UN to make necessary efforts at this session of the UN General Assembly to end the dangerous situation in the Comoros and restore the rule of law and public order.

The Islamic Conference Organization has dispatched its deputy secretary-general in charge of political affairs to the UN to coordinate the efforts of Islamic countries to enable the current UN General Assembly to adopt an appropriate emergency resolution on the situation in the Comoros.

Paris, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) (Reporter: Shen Xiaopian) Led by the supply ship "Marne," four French vessels set sail from Mayotte Island in the Indian Ocean early this morning, heading towards the waters off the Comoros.

There is news that these French vessels are not going to the Comoros to carry out the mission of repatriating French citizens, but rather to conduct armed patrols and display military might in the waters off the Comoros Island.

    新华社突尼斯12月12日电　据突尼斯非洲通讯社今天报道，伊斯兰会议组织秘书长哈迈德·阿尔·阿比德就科摩罗局势问题致电联合国。
    阿比德在分别发给联合国秘书长、第44届联合国大会主席和伊斯兰会议组织成员国常驻联合国代表的电文中说，自科摩罗总统艾哈迈德·阿卜杜拉·阿卜杜拉曼11月26日遇害之后，雇佣军篡夺了国家政权，中止了立宪机构的活动，把全国人民作为人质，使科摩罗出现了危险和令人难以接受的局势。
    他呼吁伊斯兰国家驻联合国代表在本届联合国大会上作出必要的努力，便以结束科摩罗的危险局势，恢复法制和公共秩序。
    伊斯兰会议组织已派遣其负责政治事务的副秘书长前往联合国协调伊斯兰国家的努力，以便使本届联大就科摩罗局势问题作出一项适当的紧急决议。
    新华社巴黎12月13日电（记者沈孝泉）由供应舰“马恩”号为首的4艘法国舰只今天凌晨从位于印度洋上的马约特岛启航，开赴科摩罗海域。
