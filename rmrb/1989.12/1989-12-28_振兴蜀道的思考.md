    Reflections on Revitalizing the Shu Road
    Zhang Haoruo, Governor of Sichuan Province

    Sichuan is the strategic rear area of the motherland and an important industrial base. The strategic position of road transportation in Sichuan's economic and social development is becoming increasingly prominent.

    Before liberation, Sichuan's road transportation was extremely backward. The two provinces of Sichuan and Kham had only 8,472 kilometers of roads, of which more than 4,000 kilometers could barely accommodate vehicles, and more than one-third of the counties did not have roads. "The Shu Road is difficult, as difficult as ascending to the sky" was a true reflection of Sichuan's transportation situation at that time. After liberation, after forty years of construction, Sichuan's transportation has undergone significant changes. By the end of 1988, the province's total road mileage was 95,128 kilometers, ranking first in the country. All counties, cities, and districts in the province, 94.5% of townships, and 62.8% of villages have access to roads, which has greatly promoted economic development.

    However, due to Sichuan's complex terrain and continuous hills, road construction requires large investments, and the problem of "difficult Shu Road" has not been fundamentally solved. In the past 40 years, Sichuan's motor vehicles have increased more than 100 times, while roads have only increased 10 times, and many roads have low standards and poor conditions. Sichuan's road transportation still cannot meet the needs of economic development.

    How to quickly change the situation of Sichuan's road transportation being seriously backward? I believe we must start from the following three aspects:

    First, local governments at all levels must genuinely focus on road construction. In the past decade, our provincial governments have made efforts in the following areas: First, various levels of government have truly regarded road construction as a strategic priority for the province's national economic development. Governors, mayors, prefectural heads, commissioners, and county heads have personally overseen road construction, and a number of outstanding achievements have been made in road construction by "road county heads," "road commissioners," and "road mayors." The importance of road construction has become a trend among governments at all levels. Second, fully leverage the coordinating functions of governments at all levels, do a good job in the overall planning of the region, mobilize and organize local labor to build roads, implement work-relief projects, coordinate and resolve difficult issues such as land acquisition, relocation, compensation, and resettlement in planning and construction, and ensure the smooth progress of construction. Third, strive to increase road construction investment. In addition to striving for national support and actively introducing foreign capital, local governments at all levels have spared no effort to raise funds to increase road construction investment. The portion of the road maintenance fee collected by the state that can be allocated to local areas is returned in full by the province to the transportation department for road construction. In the past ten years, the province has raised a total of 660 million yuan for road construction. Fourth, implement the comprehensive road construction and road maintenance responsibility system, and increase the responsibility of local governments for road construction and maintenance.

    Second, mobilize the masses and rely on the strength of the entire society to revitalize the Shu Road. To revitalize the Shu Road, we adhere to the principle of "people's transportation, people's efforts" and mobilize and rely on the broad masses of the people to launch a major road construction campaign. In economically developed basin areas, organize and mobilize the masses to build roads with local labor. Since 1983, the province has invested a total of 4.7 billion man-days of local labor to widen and improve 30,000 kilometers of roads, significantly improving the road conditions in the basin. In economically poor areas around the basin and ethnic minority areas, mobilize the masses to build roads through work-relief projects. With the support of the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Communications, since 1984, the province has invested nearly 400 million yuan in work-relief materials and matching funds at various levels to build 9,000 kilometers of mountain roads, enabling 174 townships to have access to automobiles.

    Third, promote the benign cycle of self-accumulation and self-development of road transportation. I have been working in Sichuan for a short time, but I have already felt that this problem must be solved as soon as possible. To this end, I suggest taking the following measures:

    (1) Increase the proportion of transportation investment in national investment. In the past decade, the proportion of transportation investment in the country's total investment has decreased, and the same is true for roads. Insufficient investment is the root cause of transportation arrears and backwardness. We hope that during the three-year rectification and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, the country can, as far as possible, appropriately increase transportation, including road investment, to reverse the trend of decreasing investment proportions. At the same time, the country should return the portion of the road maintenance fee collected to the road transportation sector based on the principle of taking from the roads and using it for the roads. The country should give appropriate consideration to regions with inconvenient transportation in the allocation of transportation investment.

    (2) Currently, commercial enterprises have a backlog of unsold goods, which is a good opportunity to implement work-relief projects. It is suggested that the long-term policy of work-relief projects remain unchanged, so that the road transportation situation in the "old, border, poor, and minority" regions can be significantly improved.

    (3) Bring Sichuan's railway construction onto the national agenda to reduce the pressure on roads. In the past decade, the country has not invested in new railway construction in Sichuan, and the province's railway transportation is very tight, operating at full capacity and with diseases for a long time. We hope the country will pay attention to Sichuan's railway construction and increase investment in civil aviation and waterway construction to help Sichuan quickly change the face of the Shu Road.

### 振兴蜀道的思考

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    振兴蜀道的思考
    四川省省长  张皓若
    四川是祖国的战略大后方，重要的工业基地。公路交通在四川经济和社会发展中的战略位置日益突出。
    解放前，四川公路交通极为落后。川、康两省仅有公路8472公里，其中4000余公里只能勉强通车，1／3以上的县不通公路。“蜀道难，难于上青天”，就是昔日四川交通状况的真实写照。解放后，经过四十年的建设，四川交通面貌有了显著改观。截至1988年底，全省公路通车里程95128公里，居全国之首。全省所有的县、市、区，94.5％的乡，62.8％的村通了公路，有力地推动了经济发展。
    但由于四川地形复杂，山丘连绵，公路建设投资大，“蜀道难”的问题尚未得到彻底解决。40年来，四川机动车增长100余倍，公路仅增长10倍，而且不少公路标准低、路况差。四川公路交通仍然适应不了经济发展的需要。
    如何尽快改变四川公路交通严重滞后的局面？我认为必须从以下三个方面入手：
    第一、地方各级政府要实打实地抓公路建设。近十年，我省历届政府努力抓了以下几环：一是各级政府真正把公路建设作为全省国民经济发展的战略重点，省长、市长、州长、专员、县长亲自抓修路，涌现出一批在公路建设中做出突出成绩的“路县长”、“路专员”、“路市长”，重视公路建设已在各级政府中蔚然成风。二是充分发挥各级政府的统筹、协调功能，搞好本地区的总体规划，做好发动和组织民工建勤、以工代赈工作，协调解决规划建设中占地、搬迁、补偿、安置等棘手问题，保证了建设顺利进行。三是努力增加公路建设投入，除了尽力争取国家支持、积极引进外资外，我省地方各级财政千方百计挤出钱来增加公路建设投资。国家从养路费中征集的能交基金地方分成部分，省里如数返还交通部门，用于公路建设。在过去十年里，全省共筹集公路建设资金6.6亿元。四是实行全省公路建设大包干和养路体制的下放，加重了地方政府修路养路的责任。
    第二，发动群众，依靠全社会的力量振兴蜀道。为了振兴蜀道，我们坚持“人民交通人民办”，放手发动和依靠广大群众，大打修路之仗。在经济条件较好的盆地地区，组织发动群众民工建勤岁修公路。1983年以来，全省共投入建勤岁修工日4.7亿个，加宽改造公路3万多公里，使盆地公路路况有了很大改善。在经济贫困的盆周山区、民族地区，发动群众以工代赈修建公路。在国家计委、交通部的支持下，1984年以来，全省先后投入以工代赈物资和各级配套资金近4亿元，修建山区公路9000余公里，使174个乡镇通了汽车。
    第三，促进公路交通自我积累、自我发展的良性循环。我到四川工作的时间不长，已经感到，这个问题必须尽快解决。为此，建议采取一些措施：
    （一）提高交通投资在国家投资中的比重。近十年，交通投资占国家全部投资的比重有所下降，公路也是如此，投资不足，是交通欠帐、滞后的根源。我们希望国家在三年治理整顿和“八五”计划期间，能尽可能地适当增加交通包括公路投资，扭转投资比重下降的局面。同时，国家从养路费中征集能交基金，最好本着取之于公路，用之公路的原则，返还给公路交通。国家在交通投资分配中，对于交通不便的地区要给予适当照顾。
    （二）目前工商企业商品滞销积压，正是搞以工代赈的良好时机。建议长期坚持以工代赈政策不变，使“老、边、穷、少”地区公路交通面貌有更加明显的改观。
    （三）把四川铁路建设提上国家日程，减轻公路压力。近十几年来，国家一直没有在四川投资新修铁路，全省铁路运输十分紧张，长期超负荷带病运行。希望国家重视四川铁路建设，并增加民航、水路建设投资，帮助四川尽快改变蜀道面貌。
