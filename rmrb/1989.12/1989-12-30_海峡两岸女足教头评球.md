Coach of the Chinese Women's Football Team, Shang Ruihua: In the second half, at the 20-minute mark, number 13, Niu Lijie, replaced number 7, Wu Weiying, because Wu was being closely marked by the opposing team. The Taipei team played better than in the first match, and their defense was strengthened. In the second half, our team's passing game lacked variety. When the opposing team fought hard, our team's performance declined. The Chinese team's adaptability still needs improvement. If the Taipei team had more stamina, they would pose a greater threat to the Chinese team.

Head Coach of the Chinese Taipei Women's Football Team, Xiao Yongfu: Although we played better than in our first encounter on the 18th, we still did not play to our full potential. From the match situation, the players were too nervous and did not play freely enough. During the game, we focused too much on defending against Wu Weiying and neglected Sun Qingmei's attacks from the left side, resulting in some oversights.

    海峡两岸女足教头评球
    中国队教练商瑞华：下半场二十分钟时由十三号牛丽杰替下七号吴伟英，是因为吴被对方盯得太死。台北队比首场打得好，后防加强了。下半场我方球路变化较差。对方一拚，我方就发挥不好。中国队应变能力仍需提高。台北队如体力再强点，将对中国队构成更大威胁。
    中国台北队总教练萧永福：我们虽然踢得比十八日第一次相遇时好，但仍没有打出自己的水平。从比赛情况看，队员们心理上紧张有余，打得不够放开。比赛中，我们只注意了对吴伟英的重点防守，却忽略了孙庆梅从左路发起的进攻，有些顾此失彼。
