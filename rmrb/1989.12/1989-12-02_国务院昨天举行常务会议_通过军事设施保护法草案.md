The State Council held its 51st executive meeting this morning. The meeting, presided over by Premier Li Peng, discussed and approved in principle the draft of the "People's Republic of China Military Facilities Protection Law." It was decided that this draft law will be further revised and submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

The meeting noted that to defend national security interests and resist external aggression, the state has built military facilities in coastal defense, border defense frontlines, and deep rear areas. These facilities have laid the material foundation for maintaining national territorial sovereignty and integrity and have created the necessary conditions for the troops to complete various tasks. The protection of military facilities is related to the long-term interests of national security and the fundamental interests of the people across the country. It is necessary to formulate a special law to protect military facilities, so that all levels of people's governments and military organs have legal basis to rely on when protecting military facilities, and so that all organizations and citizens clearly understand their responsibilities and obligations to protect military facilities.

Eleven members of the State Council's executive meeting attended today's meeting, and three were absent.

    国务院昨天举行常务会议  通过军事设施保护法草案
    新华社北京12月1日电　国务院今天上午举行第51次常务会议。会议在李鹏总理主持下，讨论并原则通过了《中华人民共和国军事设施保护法（草案）》，决定将这一法律草案进一步修改后提交全国人大常委会审议。
    会议认为，为了捍卫国家安全利益，抵御外来侵略，国家在海防、边防前线及纵深地区修建了军事设施。这些设施为维护国家领土主权和完整奠定了物质基础，也为部队完成各项任务创造了必要的条件。对军事设施的保护关系到国家安全的长远利益和全国人民的根本利益。制定保护军事设施的专门法律，使各级人民政府和军事机关在保护军事设施时有法可依，使所有组织和公民明确对保护军事设施的责任和义务，是非常必要的。
    国务院常务会议成员11人出席了今天的会议，3人请假。
