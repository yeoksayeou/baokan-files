A Day in the Life of an Old Minister

On November 18, Yang Chun, the principal responsible person of the State Council's schistosomiasis investigation team and former deputy minister of the Ministry of Health, disregarded the fatigue of long-distance travel and his advanced age and frail health, and came to Dongzhi County to investigate schistosomiasis.

She conversed with students, village girls, village cadres, and schistosomiasis prevention personnel to understand the situation; she inspected the density of snails by the riverbank and streamside; she visited patients in severely affected areas. She repeatedly urged the county government officials to take responsibility and control schistosomiasis. On this day, this old minister worked for twelve hours!

On the land of the Republic, there are not just a few retired Communist Party cadres who are so closely connected with the people!

    老部长的一天
    十一月十八日，国务院血防调查组主要负责人、原卫生部副部长杨纯，不顾长途颠簸，年高体弱，来东至县考察血吸虫病。
    她与学生、村姑、村干、血防人员交谈，了解情况；到江滩边、溪水边察看钉螺密度；到重疫区看望病人。她一再叮嘱县政府负责同志一定要尽责控制血吸虫病。这一天，这位老部长工作达十二小时！
          在共和国的土地上，像这样和人民心心相连的已经离退休的共产党干部，又何止这一位！
