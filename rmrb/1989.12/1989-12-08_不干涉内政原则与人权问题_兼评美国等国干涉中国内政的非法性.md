Since the Chinese government suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, a few Western countries have, under the pretext of "human rights," rudely interfered in China's internal affairs. This not only violates international relations norms but also seriously contravenes the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as stipulated by international law.

Non-interference in internal affairs is a fundamental principle of international law. The principle of non-interference in internal affairs is derived directly from the principle of sovereign equality of states and is one of the basic principles of modern international law. It has been recognized by the United Nations Charter (hereinafter referred to as the Charter) and a series of international legal documents. Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter states: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." In 1954, China and India jointly proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which developed the principle of non-interference in internal affairs into "mutual non-interference in internal affairs." This was later adopted by many countries as a guiding principle for inter-state relations. The United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty in 1965, and the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the Declaration on Principles of International Law) in 1970, which provided more detailed regulations on the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. In the latter declaration, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is expressed as "the obligation of non-intervention in the internal affairs of any state in accordance with the Charter," and it is listed as one of the "basic principles of international law."

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs includes the legal concepts of "internal affairs" and "interference." What constitutes internal affairs? Internal affairs refer to "domestic jurisdiction." The famous British international law scholar Akhurst points out that domestic jurisdiction has a clear meaning: it refers to matters that each country handles freely without being restricted by international law. This means that internal affairs are matters that a country handles independently and autonomously, provided that it does not violate the international obligations it has voluntarily undertaken. The core of internal affairs is a country's social, political, and economic systems.

Of course, not everything a country does within its borders is internal affairs. For example, violating the diplomatic privileges of an embassy is not an internal affair. Similarly, South Africa's enactment of laws on racial segregation also goes beyond the scope of internal affairs. The standard for distinguishing whether something is an internal affair is whether a country's handling of its internal and external affairs violates its international obligations and generally accepted principles of international law. According to the provisions of the Charter and other relevant international legal documents, the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion is purely an internal affair of China. It does not violate the provisions of the Charter, nor does it violate other principles of international law, nor does it violate the international obligations undertaken by the Chinese government. Therefore, the interference by the United States and other countries in this regard is a violation of international law.

What constitutes interference? In international law, interference refers to the behavior of one or more countries or international organizations directly or indirectly forcing their way into the internal and external affairs of a country or certain inter-state disputes. Interference can be legal or illegal. The standard for distinguishing whether interference is legal is mainly whether such interference is in accordance with the principles of sovereign equality of states and other generally accepted principles of international law, and whether the purpose and means of interference are in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and relevant international conventions. For example, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly passed resolutions condemning South Africa's policy of racial segregation, and some countries have imposed economic sanctions on South Africa. This is undoubtedly a form of interference. The purpose of this interference is to stop the crime of racial segregation recognized by international law, and it does not constitute interference in South Africa's internal affairs, so it is a legal form of interference. As for the interference by the United States and a few other countries in the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, it is a different matter. It violates the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter, interferes in China's internal affairs, violates the principle of sovereign equality stipulated in the Charter, infringes upon China's sovereignty, and also violates the obligations of non-interference in China's internal affairs undertaken in the joint statements of establishing diplomatic relations with China. Therefore, it is illegal interference.

According to the provisions of the Declaration on Principles of International Law, non-interference in internal affairs means "no state or group of states has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other state." The declaration clearly explains the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and lists five items: (1) "Armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats to the personality of a state or its political, economic, and cultural elements are violations of international law"; (2) "It is not permitted to use or encourage the use of economic, political, or any other means to force another state to yield its sovereign rights and to obtain any kind of benefit from that state"; (3) "It is not permitted to organize, assist, incite, fund, encourage, or allow activities aimed at overthrowing another country's government by violence, subversion, terrorism, or armed struggle, or to interfere in another country's internal conflicts"; (4) "The use of force to deprive a people of their national characteristics constitutes a violation of their inalienable rights and the principle of non-interference"; (5) It is not permitted to interfere in any way with the inalienable right of each state to choose its political, economic, social, and cultural systems.

According to the above provisions, the various measures taken by the Chinese government in Beijing to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion are expressions of the Chinese government's exercise of "sovereign rights" and are purely internal affairs of China. The criticism and "sanctions" measures taken by the United States and a few other countries against the above sovereign actions, which are purely internal affairs of China, are "interference" and "threats" to China's "state personality" and "political, economic" aspects. They are also "using or encouraging the use of economic, political, or any other means to force another state to yield its sovereign rights," and they are "inciting," "encouraging," or "allowing activities aimed at overthrowing another country's government by violence." Thus, they trample on the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.

The domestic legal aspect and the international legal aspect of human rights issues

The issue of human rights was originally a political slogan of the bourgeois revolution, aimed at opposing feudal privileges and theocracy. The most important constitutional documents regulating human rights issues are the United States Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776, and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of August 26, 1789. Initially, human rights were still mainly a domestic legal issue. By the 19th century, human rights issues had entered the field of international relations to a considerable extent. Human rights issues entered the field of international relations and international law on a large scale after World War II. The Charter, which came into effect in October 1945, mentions human rights in seven places. Under the auspices of the United Nations, by December 1988, 67 declarations, conventions, and protocols on human rights issues had been adopted. The most important of these are the three documents known as the "International Bill of Human Rights," namely the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. The latter two covenants are collectively known as the International Covenant on Human Rights. There is considerable debate in the international legal community regarding the concept of human rights and the content of international human rights law. It can be said that to this day, there is no universally accepted concept of human rights.

According to the bourgeois concept of human rights in the 17th and 18th centuries, "human rights" refer to some basic rights and freedoms of the individual, mainly including the right to equality, the right to life, the inviolability of private property, and the freedoms of speech, assembly, publication, and association. According to the provisions of international documents on human rights issues, modern human rights refer to the rights that people should enjoy, including the right to existence, the right to self-determination, the right to development, and the legal rights and freedoms that individuals enjoy. In terms of legal status, modern human rights have both domestic legal and international legal aspects, but they are mainly domestic legal issues.

The domestic legal aspect of human rights mainly refers to the fact that a state, based on the principle of sovereignty, has the right to formulate its constitution and other laws, stipulating which rights its citizens and foreigners in its territory enjoy and which obligations they bear, and stipulating the punishment of domestic and foreign individuals who violate the constitution and laws. These all belong to the internal affairs of a country, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. Of course, when a state formulates various laws, it must fulfill its international obligations.

The international legal aspect of human rights mainly refers to the fact that the provisions of various countries' constitutions and laws on human rights issues must be in accordance with the obligations undertaken by the country in the protection of international human rights, and there must be no violations. According to the provisions of various international documents on human rights issues, the international obligations undertaken by a state in the field of human rights are also the main contents of international human rights protection, including: not infringing upon the right to self-determination and development of other countries and peoples and their permanent sovereignty over their natural resources, not depriving their citizens of their means of livelihood; not infringing upon or threatening the right to existence of the people of other countries; not implementing policies of racial discrimination, racial segregation, and genocide; not promoting slavery and similar institutions and customs; not engaging in international terrorist activities, etc.; any state that violates any of the above obligations is a violation of international law, and any other state has the right to take appropriate measures to stop it, which does not constitute interference in the internal affairs of the responsible state.

The Chinese government, in accordance with the constitution and other laws, declared martial law in some areas of Beijing and suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, which was entirely for the purpose of "maintaining national security or public order and tranquility" (as stated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and taking necessary measures. This approach is not at all a violation of "human rights," but rather a legal punishment of criminals who violate the constitution and other laws. This is purely an internal affair of China and does not violate any international obligations undertaken by the Chinese government. Therefore, the interference by the United States and a few other countries in this regard is entirely illegal.

The relationship between the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and human rights issues

As mentioned above, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is a fundamental principle of international law, while the international legal aspect of human rights issues, i.e., the so-called principle of international protection of human rights, belongs to the specific principles of international law. Therefore, the relationship between the two is the relationship between basic principles and specific principles, which mainly includes the following two aspects:

First and foremost, no country can use human rights issues as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, nor can it be said that the domestic aspect of human rights is the international aspect and use it as a pretext for interference. Some Western scholars, in order to create a theoretical basis for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, use "human rights" as a pretext to propose the fallacy of "humanitarian intervention" and say that such interference is "permitted by law." This statement has no basis in international law. As long as it is the internal affairs of a country, no matter what pretext is used for interference, it is a violation of international law. Even if it is done under the banner of "human rights" and "humanitarian intervention," it cannot reduce its illegality.

Secondly, no country can use "internal affairs" as a pretext to avoid fulfilling its international obligations to respect basic human rights. The South African authorities' implementation of the policy of racial segregation and Israel's long-term oppression and expulsion of Palestinians are international crimes of violating basic human rights, which cannot be used as a pretext for "internal affairs" to defend themselves.

From the perspective of international practice, the United States and a few Western countries, on the one hand, use "human rights" as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by all means, but on the other hand, they use "internal affairs" as a pretext to prevent other countries from interfering in serious violations of the international obligations to respect basic human rights, such as the extensive trampling of basic human rights and the commission of international crimes by South African racists and Israel. This double standard in the internal affairs and human rights issues shows that the United States and a few countries are using the maintenance of "human rights" as a cover to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, which is a typical manifestation of hegemony.

    不干涉内政原则与人权问题
    ——兼评美国等国干涉中国内政的非法性
    富学哲
    自中国政府平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱以来，少数西方国家打着“人权”的旗号，粗暴地干涉中国的内政。这不仅破坏了国际关系准则，而且严重地违反了国际法关于不干涉内政原则。
    不干涉内政是国际法的一项基本原则
    不干涉内政原则是由国家主权平等原则直接引伸出来的现代国际法的基本原则之一，并已为《联合国宪章》（以下简称《宪章》）和一系列国际法文件所确认。《宪章》第2条第7款规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。1954年中印和中缅共同倡导的和平共处五项原则，将不干涉内政发展成为“互不干涉内政”。其后被许多国家视为处理国与国关系中应遵循的准则。联合国大会于1965年通过了《关于各国内政不容干涉及其独立与主权之保护宣言》，于1970年通过了《关于各国依联合国宪章建立友好关系及合作之国际法原则宣言》（以下简称《国际法原则宣言》），对不干涉内政原则作了较详尽的规定。在后一宣言中，将不干涉内政原则表述为“依照宪章不干涉任何国家国内管辖事件之义务之原则”，并将其列为“国际法之基本原则”之一。
    不干涉内政原则包含“内政”与“干涉”两个法律概念。什么是内政呢？内政就是“国内管辖事件”。英国著名的国际法学者阿库斯特指出，所谓国内管辖，有着明确的含义，它指的是那些各国不受国际法所加义务的限制，而自由处理的事务。这就是说，内政是一国在不违背其所自愿承担的国际义务的前提下，由该国独立自主地处理的各项内外事务。内政的核心是一国的社会、政治和经济制度。
    当然，一国在其境内所为并非都是内政，例如侵犯外交使馆的外交特权就不是内政。又如南非制定关于种族隔离的法律，也超出了内政的范围。区分是否内政的标准，是看一国处理其内外事务是否有悖于其所承担的国际义务和公认的国际法原则。按照《宪章》和其他有关国际法文件的规定，中国政府平息反革命暴乱纯属中国的内政，既未违背《宪章》的规定，也未违背国际法的其他原则，更未违背中国政府所承担的国际义务。因此，美国等国就此所进行的干涉，都是有违于国际法的行为。
    什么是干涉呢？在国际法上，干涉是指一国或数国或国际组织，以直接或间接的方式强行介入某国的内外事务或某些国家间争端的行为。干涉有合法与非法之分。区分干涉是否合法的标准，主要是看这种干涉是否符合国家主权平等原则和公认的国际法其他原则，还要看干涉的目的和手段是否符合《宪章》和有关国际公约的规定。例如：联合国大会曾多次通过决议谴责南非实行种族隔离政策，有些国家还对南非采取了经济制裁措施，这无疑是一种干涉。这种干涉的目的是制止在国际法上公认的种族隔离罪行，并不构成对南非内政的干涉，因而是一种合法的干涉。至于美国等少数国家对中国政府平息反革命暴乱所进行的干涉则是另一码事，它违背了《宪章》第2条第7款的规定，干涉了中国的内政，违背了《宪章》规定的主权平等原则，侵犯了中国的主权，同时，也违背了它们在同中国建交的联合声明中所承担的不干涉中国内政的义务，因而是非法的干涉。
    按照《国际法原则宣言》的规定，不干涉内政是指“任何国家或国家集团均无权以任何理由直接或间接干涉任何其他国家之内政或外交事务。”该宣言对不干涉内政原则作了明确的解释，列举了五项内容：（1）对他国进行“武装干涉及对国家人格或其政治、经济及文化要素之一切其他形式之干预或试图威胁，均系违反国际法”；（2）“不得使用或鼓励使用经济、政治或任何他种措施强迫另一国家，以取得该国主权权利行使上之屈从，并自该国获取任何种类之利益”；（3）“不得组织、协助、煽动、资助、鼓动或容许目的在于以暴力推翻另一国政权之颠覆、恐怖或武装活动，或干预另一国之内争”；（4）“使用武力剥夺各民族之民族特性构成侵犯其不可移让之权利及不干涉原则之行为”；（5）不得以任何方式干涉每一国家“选择其政治、经济、社会及文化制度之不可移让之权利”。
    根据上述规定，中国政府在北京平息反革命暴乱中，依法所被迫采取的各种措施，都是中国政府行使“主权权利”的表现，完全属于中国的内政。美国等少数国家对纯属中国内政的上述主权行为进行指责，并采取“制裁”措施，就是对中国“国家人格”及“政治、经济”等方面的“干预”和“威胁”，也是“使用或鼓励使用经济、政治或任何他种措施强迫另一国家，以取得该国主权权利行使上之屈从”，又是“煽动”、“鼓动或容许目的在于以暴力推翻另一国政权之颠覆、恐怖或武装活动”，从而践踏了不干涉内政原则。”
    人权问题的国内法方面与国际法方面
    人权问题原是资产阶级革命时期提出的一个政治口号，意在反对封建特权和神权。规定人权问题的最重要的宪法性文献，是1776年7月4日的美国《独立宣言》和1789年8月26日的法国《人权和公民权宣言》。人权问题起初还只是国内法的问题。到了19世纪，人权问题已在相当的规模上进入了国际关系领域。人权问题大规模地进入国际关系和国际法的领域是在第二次大战之后。1945年10月生效的《宪章》就有7处提到人权。在联合国的主持下，截至1988年12月，已通过了关于人权问题的宣言、公约和议定书共67件。其中最重要的是被称为“国际人权宪章”的三个文件，即1948年《世界人权宣言》、1966年的《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》和《经济、社会、文化权利国际公约》。上述两公约又合称为《国际人权公约》。关于人权的概念和国际人权法的内容，国际法学界争论颇大。可以说，到目前为止，并没有一个为世界各国所公认的人权概念。
    按照17、18世纪资产阶级的人权观念，所谓“人权”是指个人的一些基本权利和自由，主要包括平等权、生命权、私有财产不可侵犯权以及言论、集会、出版和结社等项自由。根据关于人权问题的国际文件的规定，现代的人权是指人民应当享有的生存权、民族自决权、发展权和个人享有的一些法定权利与自由。现代意义的人权就其法律地位而言，既有国内法的问题，也有国际法的问题，但主要是国内法的问题。
    人权的国内法方面主要是指国家依据主权原则有权制定宪法和其他法律，规定本国公民和正在该国境内的外国人，享受哪些权利和承担哪些义务，规定对违反宪法与法律的内国人和外国人进行惩处。这些都属于一国的内政，任何外国均不得干涉。当然，国家在制定各项法律时，必须履行其所承担的国际义务。
    人权问题的国际法方面主要是指：各国宪法和各项法律关于人权问题的规定，必须符合该国在国际人权保护方面所负的义务，而不得有任何违反。根据关于人权问题的各项国际文件的规定，国家在人权方面所负的国际义务，也是属于国际人权保护的主要内容有：不得侵犯他国和各民族的民族自决权和发展权及对于其自然资源的永久主权，不得剥夺其国民生计；不得侵犯或威胁他国人民的生存权；不得实行种族歧视、种族隔离和灭绝种族的政策；不得推行奴隶制和类似制度与习俗；不得进行国际恐怖主义活动等；一个国家凡是违反上述任何一条义务，都属于违反国际法的行为，任何其他国家都有权采取适当措施予以制止，而不构成对责任国内政的干涉。
    中国政府依据宪法和其他法律宣布在北京部分地区实行戒严和平息反革命暴乱，完全是为了“维护国家安全或公共安宁、公共秩序”（《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》语）所采取的必要措施。这种做法根本不是什么“侵犯人权”，而是依法对于违反宪法和其他法律的犯罪分子进行惩处。这纯属中国的内政，并不违反中国政府所承担的任何一项国际义务。因此，美国等少数国家对此所进行的干涉，就完全是非法的。
    不干涉内政原则与人权问题的关系
    如前所述，不干涉内政原则是国际法的一项基本原则，而人权问题的国际法方面，即所谓人权国际保护的原则，则属于国际法的具体原则。因此，两者关系就是基本原则与具体原则的关系，它主要包括以下两个方面：
    首先，最根本的一条是任何国家都不能以人权问题为借口而干涉他国内政，也不允许将人权的国内方面硬说成是国际方面而加以干涉。一些西方学者为了给干涉他国内政制造理论根据，便以“人权”为借口提出了“人道主义的干涉”的谬论，并说进行这种干涉是“法律所允许的”。这种说法是没有任何国际法依据的。只要是一国的内政，不管以什么名义进行干涉，都是违反国际法的行为，即使是打着“人权”和“人道主义的干涉”的旗号，也不能减免其非法性。
    其次，任何国家都不得以“内政”为借口而不履行其所承担的尊重基本人权的国际义务。南非当局实行种族隔离政策和以色列长期镇压和驱赶巴勒斯坦人，即是侵犯基本人权的国际罪行，是不能以“内政”为借口进行辩解的。
    从国际实践来看，美国等少数西方国家，一方面以“人权”为借口不择手段地干涉别国的内政，但在另一方面，对于严重违反尊重基本人权的国际义务的行为，却以“内政”为借口而不许他国干预，例如对大规模地践踏基本人权、犯有国际罪行的南非种族主义者和以色列百般袒护。这种在内政与人权问题上实行“双重标准”，说明美国等少数国家是在以维护“人权”为名而行干涉他国内政之实，是强权政治的典型表现。
