Chinese, Australian, and Soviet historians have jointly discovered that the city of Lijian, established during the reign of Emperor Yuan of the Western Han Dynasty, was used to house Roman prisoners of war. This city is located within the jurisdiction of Yongchang County in Gansu Province.

This discovery not only solves the historical mystery of the disappearance of a Roman army of over 6,000 soldiers who fled after being defeated by the Persians in 53 BCE, but also has significant implications for the study of Sino-Western relations.

In ancient China, Rome was referred to as "Da Qin" or "Lijian." The "Records of the Grand Historian" mentions "Anxi...to the north, there are Yanqie and Lijian." In 54 BCE, the Roman slave-owner and military leader Crassus led seven legions and over 40,000 soldiers to attack Anxi (present-day northeastern Iran). The following year, in a major battle at Carrhae (present-day Parthia in Syria), they were defeated by the Persians. His eldest son, the commander of the first legion, led the remaining 6,000 soldiers to break through the enemy lines and, after many twists and turns, eventually reached the Kangju Kingdom (present-day Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union), becoming vassals of the Huns. This Roman army then vanished from Western historical records. Their ultimate fate became a mystery that has puzzled historians for centuries.

Early this year, four scholars—Guan Yiquan, a specialist in Central Asian history from the Northwest Nationalities Institute, Chen Zhengyi, a Soviet historian from Lanzhou University, Australian expert Harris, and Soviet expert F.V. Vasenkin—collaborated to solve this historical puzzle. By comparing Chinese and Western historical records, they made a significant breakthrough. They found crucial information in the "Biography of Chen Tang" in the "Book of the Later Han." According to the biography, in 36 BCE, Han's Protector General Gan Yan and Deputy Commander Chen Tang led over 40,000 soldiers to attack the Xiongnu leader Zhizhi. During the battle at Zhizhi City (present-day Dzambul City in the Soviet Union), they encountered a strange army. "There were over a hundred infantrymen, forming a fish-scale formation at the gate, practicing military tactics," and "outside the earthen city, there was a double wooden city." This formation of circular shields in a fish-scale pattern and the method of building a "double wooden city" were unique to the ancient Roman army. Scholars believe that these soldiers were the missing Roman army that had disappeared 17 years earlier. In this war, the Han army achieved a great victory, capturing 145 prisoners and surrendering over 1,000. Among the prisoners were many Lijian people. To accommodate them, the Western Han government established the city of Lijian in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, to house these Roman prisoners of war.

Scholars also found that Chinese historical records frequently mention Lijian. The "Book of the Later Han" records, "Da Qin, also known as Lijian," and the "Book of Wei" records it as "Lixuan." The "Chronicles of the Five Barbarians" also record, "In the tenth year of Yonghe, the former Qiang Zhang Zuo sent troops to attack Lijian in the southern mountains, suffering a great defeat." The "Book of Han" records, "Today, the locals call Lijian, and when spoken quickly, it sounds like Liqian." The "Book of Sui" changed Lijian to "Liqian" and recorded, "During the Kaihuang era, Liqian was incorporated into Fanhe County." After the Tang Dynasty, there were three uprisings by the Liqian people in the Hexi Corridor, all of which are recorded in historical documents. Even in the works of Zhang Shuo's "Eryou Tang Wenji" and Tao Baolian's "Xinmao Shixingji" during the Qing Dynasty, there are descriptions of the city of Lijian.

Scholars compared historical records and on-site investigations, finding astonishing similarities. After Wang Mang usurped the Han Dynasty, he changed the name of Lijian to Qiuqu because the pronunciations were similar. In 1979, the "World Historical Atlas" published in the United States also marked the location of "Qiuqu." Scholars used methods of comparing ancient and modern pronunciations, historical records, and on-site investigations to trace back the original historical context. From the numerous ancient cities established in the Hexi Corridor since the Western Han Dynasty, scholars selected several ancient city ruins related to Lijian for archaeological excavation. Scholars also mentioned that after the Liqian people settled in the Hexi Corridor, they intermarried with the locals. After more than two thousand years, the whereabouts of their descendants remain to be researched and resolved.

    中澳苏史学家联合研究发现
    永昌有座西汉安置罗马战俘城
    公元前三十五年一支罗马溃军失踪之谜解开
    新华社兰州12月14日电　（记者郗永年、实习生孙雷钧）中国、澳大利亚、苏联的史学家联合研究发现，西汉元帝时代设置的骊靬城是用作安置罗马战俘的，这座城池在甘肃永昌县境内。
    这一发现不仅解开了公元前53年，一支6000多人的罗马军队在波斯战败突围溃逃，不知下落的历史之谜，而且对研究中外关系史有重大意义。
    我国古代称罗马为“大秦”、“骊靬”，《史记·大宛列传》中就有“安息……北有奄蔡、黎靬”的记载。公元前54年，罗马大奴隶主、军事首领克拉苏率领7个军团、4万多人的军队进攻安息（今伊朗东北），第二年在卡莱（今叙利亚的帕提亚）与波斯人一次大战中失败，其长子、第一军团首领带残部6000多人突围，几经曲折，最后逃到郅支单于占领的康居国（今苏联哈萨克共和国），成为匈奴附庸。这支罗马大军在西方史料中从此便销声匿迹。他们到底下落何处，便成了千古之谜。
    今年年初，西北民族学院中亚史专家关意权、兰州大学苏联史学者陈正义和在兰州大学任教的澳大利亚专家哈瑞斯、苏联专家弗·维·瓦谢尼金四人协同攻关，结合中西史料对比研究，解决这一历史难题。他们从班固所著《汉书·陈汤传》中取得了重要突破。据“陈汤传”载：公元前36年汉西域都护甘延寿、副校尉陈汤，带领4万多名将士讨伐郅支单于，战于郅支城（今苏联江布尔城）。陈汤等人在这里看到一些奇特的军队，“步兵百余人，夹门鱼鳞阵，讲习用兵”，“土城外有重木城”。这种用圆形盾牌连成鱼鳞形状防御的阵式和修“重木城”的方法，只有古罗马军队采用。学者们根据这一史料，认为这些人就是失踪17年的罗马残军。这次战争汉朝军队大胜，“生虏百四十五人，降虏千余人”，战俘中有不少骊靬人。为了安置他们，西汉政府便在甘肃永昌境内设置骊靬城，安置了这批罗马战俘。
    学者们还发现，对骊靬中国史籍时有记载。《后汉书·西域传》记“大秦国一名犁犍”，《魏书·西戎传》记作“黎轩”，《五凉志》还记有“永和十年，前凉张祚遣将伐骊靬于南山，大败而还”，《汉书·地理志·颜师古注》中有“今其土俗人呼骊靬，疾言之曰力虔”，《隋书》改骊靬为“力乾”，并记“开皇中，并力乾入番和（县）”。唐代以后，骊靬人在河西走廊发动过三次起义，史料均有记载。直到清朝张澍所著《二酉堂文集》和左宗棠幕僚陶保廉所著《辛卯侍行记》中，对骊靬城都有记叙。
    学者们将中外史料记载和现场考察情况加以对照，发现有惊人的契合。王莽纂汉后，因羯虏和骊靬发音相近，便改骊靬为羯虏。1979年美国出版的《世界历史地图集》中，也标有“羯虏”位置。学者们采用中外译音、古今音韵转变以及史料——现场相对比的方法，从今溯古，还原出历史的本来面目。学者们从西汉以来在河西走廊设置的多座古城中，选出数座与骊靬有关的古城遗址，将进行考古发掘。学者还说，骊靬人在河西定居后，即与当地人通婚，经过两千余年，其后裔究竟在什么地方，还待研究解决。
