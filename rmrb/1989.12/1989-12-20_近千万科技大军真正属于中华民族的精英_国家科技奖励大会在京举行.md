In the Great Hall of the People, where a large banner reads "Science and Technology is the Primary Productive Force, Improving Economic Efficiency Must Rely on Technological Progress," the National Science and Technology Awards Conference was held this afternoon. The conference awarded and commended 777 projects that won the 1989 National Science and Technology Progress Award, National Invention Award, and National Spark Award. Certificates and awards were presented to a group of scientists and inventors.

Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Wan Li, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Jinfu, Yan Jici, Song Jian, Fang Yi, and Lu Jiaxi and other leaders attended the conference and presented awards to the winning scientists and technologists. General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech.

Song Jian presided over the meeting.

Guo Shuyan, Chairman of the National Invention Award Committee and Vice Chairman of the National Science and Technology Progress Award Committee, delivered a report titled "On the 1989 National Science and Technology Awards."

He said that from 1979 to the end of 1988, the state had awarded a total of 5084 outstanding scientific and technological achievements across various fields and industries. Among them, there were 303 Natural Science Awards, 1561 Invention Awards, 3082 Science and Technology Progress Awards, and 138 Spark Awards. A total of 25,000 individuals received national awards. The economic benefits created by these projects have reached over 23 billion yuan.

In his speech titled "Promoting Technological Progress is a Historic Task for the Entire Party and the Nation," General Secretary Jiang Zemin first, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, extended warm congratulations and the highest respect to the award-winning comrades, to the representatives present, and to all scientific and technological workers across the country. He said that the nearly ten million strong science and technology force truly belong to the elite of the Chinese nation.

Jiang Zemin said that 11 years ago, when our Party called on the entire nation to strive for the Four Modernizations, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, at the National Science Conference, delivered a speech of profound significance, eloquently expounding the Marxist view that science and technology are productive forces. Recently, he has repeatedly pointed out in discussions on economic development: science and technology are the primary productive force; science is a great thing, we must attach importance to science, and ultimately, science may solve the problem. These statements further elucidate the important position and enormous role of science and technology.

Jiang Zemin emphasized that modern science and technology are undergoing a profound revolution. To vigorously develop our country's science and technology, to gradually narrow the gap with developed countries from an overall perspective, and to strive to catch up with and approach the world's advanced level, is an urgent task facing the entire Party, the nation, and all ethnic groups. We must adhere to placing science and technology in a strategic position of priority development, and rely on technological progress to improve economic and social benefits. The national policy determined by the Party and the government based on China's national conditions and the trend of contemporary scientific and technological development must be firmly established in the minds of cadres at all levels, genuinely implemented, and persistently adhered to for the long term (full text to be published separately).

Before the meeting, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, Liu Huaqing, Yang Baibing, Zhang Jinfu, Yan Jici, Song Jian, Fang Yi, and Lu Jiaxi and other leaders also met with the award-winning representatives and took a group photo together.

On December 19th, Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Wan Li, and others met with representatives of scientists and technologists who won the National Science and Technology Awards at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. (Photo attached)
