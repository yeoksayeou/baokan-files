Shenyang Railway Bureau has leveraged its rail advantages to serve society, vigorously developing the collective economy. By the end of November, over 160,000 children of its employees had secured jobs, making it the leader among the 12 railway bureaus nationwide in terms of employment for children of employees.

Ten years ago, a large number of educated youth returned from the countryside, and finding jobs for them became an urgent task for the whole society. The Shenyang Railway Bureau, with the stability of the situation in mind, adhered to the policy of "backed by the railway, facing society." It successively established hotels, restaurants, shops, food processing plants, and transportation service centers to serve passengers and freight customers, extending its services along the 9,000-kilometer railway line.

With the development of the commodity economy, the bureau leadership realized that "relying solely on the two rails" was no longer sufficient. They needed to face society and open up a broader market. Therefore, they formulated the "20 Regulations" and "10 Measures" for developing the collective economy, allowing collective enterprises to develop independently: first, starting from local resources, developing "short, flat, fast" projects; second, starting from market needs, developing "shortage" projects that are urgently needed by society; third, starting from the needs of commodity competition, developing flagship products. The Shenyang City Energy Conservation Service Center Water Quality Monitoring Station is a boiler water treatment enterprise established by an engineer leading 13 unemployed youth. According to the needs of users, it continuously increases service items, and the enterprise is thriving. Now, it has an annual output value of 4 million yuan and has become the leading unit of the "National Boiler Water Treatment Technology Service Information Network."

   背靠铁路面向社会　大力发展集体经济
   沈铁16万职工子女就业
    本报沈阳12月12日讯　沈阳铁路局依靠铁路优势，面向社会服务，大力发展集体经济，截至11月末，已有16万多名职工子女就业。子女就业人数居全国12个铁路局之首。
    10年前，大批下乡青年返城，安置他们就业成为全社会的迫切任务。沈阳铁路局从有利于安定大局出发，坚持“背靠铁路，面向社会”的方针，陆续办起了以为旅客和货主服务的旅店、饭店、商店、食品加工厂和运输营业所，服务领域伸向全局9000公里沿线。
    随着商品经济的发展，铁路局领导感到，“死啃两条铁轨”已经不够了，要面向社会开辟更广阔的市场。于是，制订了发展集体经济的“20条规定”和“10条措施”，放手让集体企业自强自立发展自己：一是从当地资源出发，开发“短、平、快”项目；二是从市场需要出发，开发社会急需的“短缺”项目；三是从商品竞争的需要出发，开发拳头产品。沈阳市节能服务中心水质监测站，是由一位工程师带领13名待业青年办起来的沈阳市第一家锅炉水处理企业，根据用户的需要不断增加服务项目，企业越办越兴旺，现在年创产值400万元，成为“全国锅炉水处理技术服务情报网”的龙头单位。（孟军　马义）
