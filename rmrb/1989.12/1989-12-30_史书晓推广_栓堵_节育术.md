The "reversible injection plugging and blocking method for vas deferens and fallopian tubes" developed by Zhao Shengcai, the director of Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital, is now being promoted by his self-funded student, Shi Shuxiao, a full-time family planning worker in Sili Dian, Fangcheng County, Henan Province, with good results.

In early 1988, the 28-year-old young doctor Shi Shuxiao heard the news that Director Zhao was holding a "plugging and blocking method" training class in Taiyuan City, and he was overjoyed. He raised and borrowed 10,000 yuan to go and study there at his own expense.

In the spring of 1989, he returned to the family planning propaganda and technology station in Sili Dian. Under very poor conditions, he performed the first "plugging and blocking" surgery on Xie Liangyan from Yuzhuang Village in the same township. After a period of observation, Xie's physical strength, sexual desire, and mental state were all normal.

Influenced by Xie Liangyan, the village subsequently performed 11 more surgeries, all of which were well-received.

In the past 10 months, he has performed 700 surgeries, with no major accidents. The subjects of the surgeries come from Sichuan, Hubei, and Henan provinces.

In September, he conducted follow-up examinations on 65 cases that had undergone surgery for more than half a year, with a contraceptive success rate of 100%.

Over the past half year, he has borrowed money to invest more than 30,000 yuan to build a standardized operating room. The number of surgeries he can perform each day has increased from the original 20 to the current 71.

    史书晓推广“栓堵”节育术
    马庆赐　张龙安　吴赵林
    山西省人民医院院长赵生才研制成功的“输精管和输卵管可复性注射栓堵法”，如今，由他的自费高材生、河南省方城县四里店乡计划生育专职干部史书晓推广，收到了很好的效果。
    1988年初，28岁的青年医生史书晓，得到了赵院长在太原市办“栓堵法”培训班的消息，高兴万分，他筹借一万元资金，自费前去学习。
    1989年春节，他回到四里店乡计划生育宣传技术所。
    在条件简陋的情况下，他给本乡余庄村的谢良严做了第一例“栓堵术”。手术经过一段观察，体力、性欲、精神都很正常。
    在谢良严的影响下，该村先后做了11例，均反映良好。
    10个月来，他共做了700例手术，没出重大事故。节育对象涉及四川、湖北、河南三省。
    9月份，他对节育半年以上的65例进行回访检查，节育率为100％。
    半年多来，他贷款陆续投资3万多元，建起了标准化手术室。由原来的每天只能做20例，发展到现在的71例。
