The Wuhan Garrison of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau has persistently carried out activities to learn from Lei Feng, using Lei Feng's spirit to educate officers and soldiers, and inspiring cadres and soldiers to become new people with ideals and morals.

The Party Committee of the Wuhan Garrison believes: Lei Feng is not only a firm believer in communism but also a model practitioner of communist thought. In today's era, when economic construction is the central task, we still need countless Lei Fengs.

Therefore, the Party Committee of the Wuhan Garrison, in light of the fact that most soldiers have an incomplete understanding of Lei Feng's spirit, organized cadres and soldiers to study "The Story of Lei Feng" and "Selected Diary of Lei Feng," and held a big discussion on "How to Inherit and Carry Forward Lei Feng's Spirit in the New Era," making Lei Feng's advanced thoughts and deeds known to everyone.

This garrison, centered around the theme of "Learning from Lei Feng's Spirit to Become a New Person with Four Qualities," extensively carried out activities to learn from Lei Feng's public-minded and selfless communist style, comparing political and ideological consciousness; learn from Lei Feng's strict self-discipline, comparing legal awareness; learn from Lei Feng's consistent words and deeds, comparing work enthusiasm; learn from Lei Feng's fearless and selfless proletarian spirit, comparing task completion; learn from Lei Feng's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, comparing doing beneficial things for the people.

During the turmoil that occurred in the spring and summer of this year, all cadres and soldiers in the garrison stood firm and clear, contributing to the maintenance of social order and the stabilization of the situation, and were praised by the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government.

This garrison inherits and carries forward the glorious tradition of serving the people, and cadres and soldiers learn from Lei Feng and take action.

In recent years, cadres and soldiers have voluntarily cleaned up garbage and transported materials totaling more than 2,000 tons, planted more than 12,000 trees, provided haircuts, repairs, and medical services to more than 20,000 people.

Every Spring Festival, the troops send personnel to more than 10 stations and docks in the garrison area to maintain order, assist the elderly and the young, and help the masses solve difficulties.

In times of national and people's life and property crises, the cadres and soldiers of this garrison stand up. On the night of May 5 last year, around 11 p.m., a fire broke out at the Wuhan North Gate Bus Station. Twenty-two passing soldiers, led by Communist Party member Zhang Liejun, rushed into the fire first, cut off the main power supply, and pushed the four burning buses to a safe area. They then worked with the firefighters who arrived later to extinguish the fire, saving the 49 buses in the station and the oil depot with 10 tons of oil, avoiding a potential major loss.

    雷锋精神在警营
    王友宽　沈伟民
    武警江苏总队无锡市支队坚持不懈地开展学习雷锋活动，用雷锋精神教育官兵，激励干部、战士做有理想、有道德的新人。
    无锡支队党委认为：雷锋既是共产主义理想的坚定信仰者，又是共产主义思想的模范实践者，在当今以经济建设为中心的时代，仍然需要千千万万个雷锋。
    于是，支队党委针对战士中大多数对雷锋精神缺乏全面认识的实际，组织干部战士学习《雷锋的故事》、《雷锋日记选》，开展“新时期怎样继承和发扬雷锋精神？”的大讨论，使雷锋的先进思想和先进事迹人人皆知。
    这个支队围绕“学雷锋精神，做四有新人”的主题，广泛开展学雷锋公而忘私的共产主义风格，比政治思想；学雷锋严于律己的精神，比法纪观念；学雷锋言行一致的革命精神，比工作干劲；学雷锋奋不顾身的无产阶级斗志，比完成任务；学雷锋全心全意为人民的精神，比为人民多做有益的事。
    在今年春夏之交发生的动乱中，全支队的干部战士立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，为维护社会治安，稳定大局作出了贡献，受到了无锡市委、市政府的赞誉。
    这个支队继承和发扬为人民服务的光荣传统，干部战士学雷锋见行动。
    近几年来，干部、战士义务清扫垃圾、搬运物资2000余吨，植树12000多株，理发、修理、送医服务2万多人次。
    每年春节期间，部队派出人员到驻地10多个车站、码头维护秩序，携老扶幼，帮助群众排忧解难。
    在国家和人民生命财产发生危难之际，这个支队的干部战士挺身而出。去年5月5日深夜11时许，无锡市北门汽车站发生大火，路过的22名战士在共产党员张列军的带领下，率先冲入火海，切断总电源，把正在燃烧的四辆大客车推到安全地带。尔后又同赶来的消防人员扑灭了火灾，保住了站内49辆大客车和储有10吨油料的油库安全，避免了一场可能发生的重大损失。
