Macau commemorates the 150th anniversary of Lin Zexu's inspection of the region. Today, in the afternoon, a statue of Lin Zexu was unveiled at the Lianfeng Temple Square in Macau.

The unveiling ceremony was attended by Zhou Ding, the head of the Macau branch of Xinhua News Agency, his deputy Wang Wenbin, Kang Jimin, the head of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, officials from relevant departments of the Macau government, Lin Zexu's descendants Ling Qing, Lin Zidong, Lin Min, and Lin Jian, scholars from mainland China who study Lin Zexu, and hundreds of people from various sectors in Macau.

The statue of Lin Zexu was built by the Macau Lianfeng Temple Charity Management Committee to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Lin Zexu's inspection of Macau and to promote his patriotic spirit. On September 3, 1839, Lin Zexu, as the Imperial Commissioner of the Qing Dynasty, inspected Macau and stayed at the Lianfeng Temple to meet local residents and Portuguese officials. The temple still preserves relevant relics and documents. The statue, standing at five meters tall and weighing five tons, is made from a single piece of light red granite. It was jointly designed by renowned Chinese sculptors Tang Daqi and Lin Bin. The statue depicts Lin Zexu wearing an official hat with a flower, a cloak, and looking into the distance with a dignified and righteous demeanor, commanding respect.

Scholars from Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China, along with Lin Zexu's descendants, held a symposium on December 9 in Macau to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Lin Zexu's inspection of Macau. They paid tribute to this world-renowned anti-drug pioneer and national hero, discussing the historical significance of his inspection of Macau as a major diplomatic move during his leadership of the anti-opium movement.
