The first DJS-type large-angle belt conveyor in China, jointly developed and manufactured by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory and Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, passed the ministry-level appraisal on November 30 in Shenyang.

Currently, China typically uses belt conveyors to transport bulk materials that need to be elevated. However, traditional belt conveyors have a maximum inclination angle of only 18 degrees. When a certain elevation height needs to be reached, the conveying distance must be extended, which results in a large footprint, extensive civil engineering work, and difficulties in process layout. In contrast, this large-angle belt conveyor has a maximum inclination angle of 60 degrees, excellent performance, is safe and reliable, easy to maintain, and can transport 500 tons of bulk materials per hour, reaching the advanced world level of the 1980s.

    大倾角带式输送机制成
    本报沈阳电　沈阳起重运输机械厂与沈阳煤矿设计院共同开发研制的我国第一部DJS型大倾角带式输送机，11月30日在沈阳通过部级鉴定。
    目前，我国通常采用带式输送机运输需要提升高度的散料。但是，以往的带式输送机最多只有18°的倾角，在需要达到一定提升高度时，就必然要加长输送距离，占地多，土建工作量大，工艺布置困难。而这种大倾角带式输送机最大倾角达60°，并且性能良好，安全可靠，便于维修，每小时运输500吨散料，达到80年代世界先进水平。（段心强）
