The *Athens News* reported on the 2nd that the United States will formulate a phased plan to withdraw its military bases from Greece in the near future.

The newspaper said that after the establishment of the interim government in Greece in November this year, the U.S. Cabinet has conducted a series of consultations with relevant department officials to discuss the formulation of a timetable and technical issues for the withdrawal of U.S. military bases from Greece.

The newspaper also said that the U.S. Department of Defense has requested to announce this withdrawal plan by early December, so that the United States can complete the technical arrangements for the withdrawal by next spring.
