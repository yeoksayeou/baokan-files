Xinghe County Eliminates Vulgar "Relationship Culture" - Party Discipline Improved, Friends Increased

By Reporter Àotēng from Hohhot

Does improved party discipline mean fewer friends? The example of Xinghe County in Inner Mongolia shows that improved party discipline actually means more friends.

Xinghe County was once one of the most difficult counties in Inner Mongolia. In 1982, the new county committee leadership began by rectifying party discipline and correcting improper practices. They established the "four nos" policy: not to change the original housing; not to use public funds for banquets; not to arrange special treatment for relatives and friends or their children; and not to accept gifts or any form of gratuity. This immediately affected a portion of the old connections in Xinghe County. The once bustling county guesthouse became quiet, and several previously popular restaurants began to suffer. For a time, both inside and outside the county, there were rumors that "party discipline improved, but friends decreased."

The new county committee leadership believed this was a temporary phenomenon. They were confident that their actions would gain the support of the majority and that true friends would increase. Therefore, they persisted in rectifying party discipline without wavering.

The facts have proven: In recent years, Xinghe County has eliminated vulgar "relationship culture." Regardless of which level of leadership they receive, they always serve simple meals and do not engage in gift-giving. Since 1984, the Autonomous Region's Planning Commission, Finance Department, and departments of finance, foreign trade, transportation, building materials, electricity management, as well as the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, have all provided support and assistance to Xinghe County in terms of funds, technology, and materials, or established economic ties with them. According to incomplete statistics, in the past five years, relevant departments at higher levels have allocated more than 20 million yuan in loans, introduced nearly 10 million yuan through horizontal economic ties, and provided other subsidies totaling more than 8 million yuan.

In recent years, Xinghe County has made more friends and received more support, and all aspects of its work have flourished.

### 兴和县破除庸俗“关系学”  党风好了　朋友多了

    兴和县破除庸俗“关系学”
    党风好了　朋友多了
    本报呼和浩特电　记者傲腾报道：党风好了，朋友是不是少了？内蒙古兴和县的事例恰恰说明：党风好了，朋友多了。
    兴和县原是内蒙古的“老大难”县。1982年新的县委领导班子从端正党风、纠正不正之风入手，制定了“四不”制度：不变原来的住房；不用公款请客；不准为自己亲友及其子女搞特殊化；不接受馈赠和任何形式的礼物。这一下触动了兴和县的一部分老关系户。以往车水马龙的县招待所显得冷清起来，过去几个高朋满座的餐馆也开始不景气了。一时间，县内县外传出“党风好了，朋友少了”的议论。
    新的县委领导班子认为这是暂时的现象，他们坚信自己的做法会得到多数同志的支持，真朋友会多起来的，因而坚持抓党风不变。
    事实表明：近几年来，兴和县破除庸俗“关系学”，无论接待哪一级的领导，一律是粗茶淡饭，更不搞馈赠。1984年来，自治区计划委员会、财政厅和金融、外贸、交通、建材、电管以及中国国际信托投资公司等部门，都从资金、技术、物资上多次给兴和县支持和帮助，或者同他们建立经济联系。据不完全统计，5年来上级有关部门拨给的贷款2000多万元，通过横向经济联系引进资金近千万元，其它补助资金800多万元。
    兴和县这几年朋友多了，得到的支持也多了，各项事业蓬勃发展。
