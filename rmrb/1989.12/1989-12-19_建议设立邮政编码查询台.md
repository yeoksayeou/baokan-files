The postal code system, after many twists and turns, has finally been gradually accepted by society and officially implemented. Its benefits in modernizing postal services and speeding up mail delivery are obvious and need not be elaborated.

However, when a new system is first implemented, it is inevitable that it will cause some inconvenience to those who are accustomed to the old ways. If a sender does not have the postal code of the recipient in advance, they must refer to two large postal code books; otherwise, they cannot send the letter. Since it is impossible for everyone to have a copy of the code book, sometimes it takes a lot of time to find a code, and sometimes it is not even possible to find it, leading to frustration and the inability to send the letter.

The postal code is a new thing and cannot be perfect from the start, but we should think of ways to reduce the inconvenience to the public. Therefore, the author suggests setting up a postal code inquiry service similar to the "114" telephone directory inquiry service, allowing senders to call and obtain the required postal code, which would be much more convenient. Only by making it convenient for the public can the postal code system be smoothly implemented. Of course, achieving this may not be easy. If the postal department can overcome the difficulties and accomplish this, it would indeed be a beneficial and praiseworthy move for the country and the people.

    建议设立邮政编码查询台
    吴祖江
    几经曲折的邮政编码制度，终于逐渐为社会所接受并正式施行了。这对提高邮政工作现代化程度、加快邮件传递速度的好处，无需赘述。
    不过，一项新制度在施行之初，不可避免地会给多年来习惯于老办法的人们增加一点不方便。一位寄信人如果不能事先得到收信人的邮政编码，就必须查阅两大本邮政编码本，否则，就无法寄信。因为编码本不可能人手一册，有时为了查到一个号码，要费好多时间，有时还查不到，干着急也无法把信寄出。
    邮政编码是新事物，不可能一开始就尽善尽美，但也要多想点办法减少群众的不便。为此，笔者建议，能不能像查询电话号码一样，增设一个类似“114”的查号台，让寄信人一拨电话，便可查知所需邮政编码，这样就方便多了。只有让群众感到方便，才更有利于邮政编码制度顺利施行。当然，办到这一点也许并不容易。邮电部门如能克服困难，办成此事，实为利国利民，万人称善之举。
