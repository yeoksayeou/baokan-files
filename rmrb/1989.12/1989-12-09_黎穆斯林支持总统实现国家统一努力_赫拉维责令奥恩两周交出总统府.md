Lebanese Muslims today held a general strike in support of the new President Hariri's efforts for national unity.

Schools, shops, banks, and all other institutions in the Muslim-dominated western part of Beirut and other Muslim areas were closed. Workers at Beirut International Airport also participated in the strike, halting work for an hour.

In the Christian-dominated eastern part of Beirut, hundreds of Aoun's supporters continued to sit in front of the Baabda Presidential Palace.

Beirut, December 7 (Xinhua) - Lebanese President Hariri warned on December 6 that if he cannot evict the dismissed Christian leader Aoun from the Baabda Presidential Palace, he will resign from his presidency.

In a statement to the press, he said, "My patience has its limits. If there is a better plan, let them find a better person." Hariri had previously given Aoun two more weeks to vacate the Presidential Palace.

Meanwhile, the artillery battle between East and West Beirut has been ongoing for two days. Syrian troops deployed near the Baabda Presidential Palace have not intervened.

    黎穆斯林支持总统实现国家统一努力
    赫拉维责令奥恩两周交出总统府
    新华社贝鲁特12月7日电  黎巴嫩穆斯林今天举行总罢工，支持新总统赫拉维为全国统一所作的努力。
    贝鲁特西区和其它所有穆斯林地区的学校、商店、银行全部关闭。贝鲁特国际机场的工作人员也响应了这次罢工，停工一小时。
    在基督教人集居的贝鲁特东区，数百名奥恩的支持者在巴卜达总统府前继续静坐。
    新华社北京12月7日电  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩新总统赫拉维6日威胁说，如果他不能将已被他解职的基督教领导人奥恩赶出巴卜达总统府，他将辞去总统职务。
    他在向新闻界发表的一份声明中说：“我的忍耐是有限度的。如果有一个比我更好的计划，那就让他们另寻高明。”赫拉维日前曾表示，再宽限奥恩两星期交出总统府。
    另外，东、西贝鲁特炮战已经持续两天。已经部署在巴卜达总统府附近的叙利亚军队没有介入。
