    Special inspections and tax education have shown results, and Jiangsu's individual tax order has improved. Our reporter, Wang Jinhu, reports: Since September this year, at the beginning of each month, in many tax offices in Jiangsu's cities and countryside, a scene unprecedented has been seen: individual business owners lining up to pay taxes. It is understood that currently, the province's individual tax timely declaration rate has reached 90%.

    This situation is in stark contrast to half a year ago. At that time, the province's individual tax order was chaotic, with over 80% of individual business owners evading taxes, and violent tax resistance incidents also occurring from time to time. Starting in May, Jiangsu took the lead nationwide in fully launching a special inspection of individual taxes to rectify individual tax issues. The provincial Party committee and government attached great importance to this work, holding several standing committee meetings and provincial governor's office meetings to specifically study and deploy the work. Various levels of tax authorities concentrated manpower to carry out inspections, checking 206,500 individual business owners and recovering over 200 million yuan in taxes. Public security, procuratorate, judicial, banking, and industrial and commercial management departments actively cooperated, effectively cracking down on tax evasion and resistance.

    During the special inspection of individual taxes, they combined the crackdown on tax evasion with tax law education, genuinely helping individual business owners strengthen their tax awareness and improve their voluntary compliance with tax laws. During the inspection, they correctly implemented policies, adhering to "three principles": First, protecting individual business owners' legal business income while investigating illegal business income; second, adhering to facts as the basis and tax laws as the standard, strictly acting in accordance with the law; third, adhering to the principle of leniency for self-reporting and severity for those caught, imposing only taxes without fines for self-reported cases, both taxes and fines for those caught, and pursuing criminal responsibility for those violating criminal laws, fully leveraging the policy's appeal, truly achieving the educational goal.

    Through the special inspection and tax law education, individual business owners have begun to form the habit of complying with tax laws, and the individual tax order has significantly improved.

    As of November 20, the province's individual tax revenue reached 840 million yuan, a 60% increase over the same period last year.

    专项检查和纳税教育见成效
    江苏个体税收秩序好转
    本报讯　记者王锦鹄报道：今年9月份以来，每月初，在江苏城乡许多税务机关，可以看到一种前所未有的情景：个体户上门排队纳税。据了解，目前这个省个体税收准期申报率已达90％。
    这一情形同半年前恰成鲜明对照。当时，该省个体税收秩序混乱，个体户偷漏税面在80％以上，暴力抗税事件也时有发生。从5月开始，江苏在全国率先全面开展个体税收专项检查，整顿个体税收。省委、省政府对这项工作十分重视，多次召开常委会、省长办公会专门研究、部署。各级税务机关集中人力开展检查，共检查了20.65万户个体户，查补税款2亿多元。公安、检察、司法、银行、工商管理等部门积极配合，有力地打击了偷漏抗税等不法行为。
    在开展个体税收专项检查时，他们把打击偷漏税行为同税法教育结合起来，切实帮助个体工商户增强纳税意识，提高依法纳税的自觉性。在检查中，他们正确执行政策，做到“三坚持”：一是坚持保护个体户的合法经营收入，查处违法经营收入；二是坚持以事实为依据，以税法为准绳，严格依法办事；三是坚持自查从宽，被查从严的原则。对自查补报的，只补税不罚款，对被查出的，既补税又罚款，对触犯刑律的，依法追究刑事责任，充分发挥政策的感召作用，真正达到教育的目的。
    通过开展专项检查和税法教育，个体工商户开始形成依法纳税的习惯，个体税收秩序明显好转。
    截至11月20日，全省个体税收达8.4亿元，比去年同期增长60％。
