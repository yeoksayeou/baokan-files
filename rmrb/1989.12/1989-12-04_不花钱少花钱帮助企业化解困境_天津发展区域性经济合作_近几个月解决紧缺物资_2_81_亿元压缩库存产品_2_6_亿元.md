In the new situation of rectification and tightening, the once-thriving horizontal economic cooperation has either cooled down or has great potential. Tianjin, focusing on the difficulties in economic work, has vigorously developed regional economic cooperation led by the government and participated by enterprises. Through horizontal complementary advantages, it has solved a number of problems that vertical methods cannot address without spending money or spending less. In the past few months, it has solved the shortage of materials worth 2.81 billion yuan and reduced the inventory of products worth 2.6 billion yuan.

A new exploration has proven that regional economic cooperation is not only a timely rain to rescue enterprises in urgent need but also a catalyst to promote the adjustment of the economic structure and increase effective supply. Unlike the past, the municipal government and the Economic Cooperation Office have carefully considered the following points:

- Under the current policy of tightening both credit and money supply, it is necessary to change the old method of relying solely on investment and administrative power to cooperate. Instead, one should focus on using information, networks, and the optimization of production factors to achieve mutual benefit and benefit without cost. For example, using Tianjin's technology to process carpets for Tibet increases the value by 70% compared to Tibet directly exporting wool. The profits are then divided according to a ratio of 2:8, benefiting both parties.

- Change the past practice of having a large cooperation scope and vague cooperation content. Focus on developing regional economic cooperation with provinces, cities, and counties as the key points. At the same time, organically combine the two levels of government cooperation and enterprise cooperation, making it a junction of planned economy and market economy.

- The focus of cooperation is to solve the "three sources" (energy, raw materials, export sources), improve the "three matches" (development of famous and short-supply products, improvement of domestic production level, and mutual matching of equipment capacity) as well as the sales of products, cooperation funds, technology transfer, and other nine items together. Stand on the current situation, look to the future, and comprehensively benefit each other.

It is reported that since July, Tianjin Municipal government economic cooperation departments have led 460 enterprises to go east, west, south, and north, signing various contracts and agreements with more than 20 provinces and cities and 107 counties, totaling 422 items, with a total value of 5.4 billion yuan. The total value of export sources is more than 70 million yuan, and 5,000 tons of chromium ore, which is in short supply in more than 30 industries such as bicycles, watches, leather, and medicine, have been coordinated at one time. Many enterprise managers have seen from the broad perspective of horizontal cooperation that the market has ups and downs, and funds have long and short terms, which is an important way to get out of the predicament and develop production.

    不花钱少花钱帮助企业化解困境
    天津发展区域性经济合作
    近几个月解决紧缺物资2.81亿元压缩库存产品2.6亿元
    本报天津12月3日电　记者肖荻报道：在治理整顿的新形势下，曾兴旺一时的横向经济联合是悄然降温，还是大有可为？天津围绕经济工作难点，大力发展由政府牵头、企业参与的区域性经济合作，通过横向优势互补，不花钱、少花钱解决了一大批纵向难以解决的难题。从7月份至今，共解决紧缺物资总值2.81亿元，压缩库存产品总值2.6亿元。
    新的探索证实：区域性经济合作既是解救企业燃眉之急的及时雨，也是促进调整经济结构、增加有效供给的催化剂。和过去不同的是，市政府及经协办审时度势，特别注意以下几点作法：
    ——在当前双紧方针下，必须改变过去那种单纯靠投资、靠行政权力搞协作的老办法，要着重靠信息、靠网络、靠生产要素的优化组合来互利互惠和不费而惠。如，以天津技术为西藏加工地毯，比西藏直接出口羊毛增值70％，尔后二八分成各受其益。
    ——改变过去联合范围过大、协作内容空泛的作法，着力发展以地、市、县为重点的区域经济合作，同时把政府间与企业间两个层次的协作有机结合起来，使之成为计划经济与市场经济的结合部。
    ——协作重点是把解决“三源”（能源、原材料、出口货源），搞好“三个配套”（发展名优短线产品、提高国产化水平、发挥设备能力的相互配套）以及销售产品、协作资金、转让技术等9项内容捆在一起干，立足当前放眼长远并综合互利。
    据悉，天津市自7月份以来，由政府经济协作部门带领460个企业走向东西南北，共和20多省市107个地、市、县签订了各类合同、协议422份，总额达5.4亿元，出口货源总值7000多万元，并一次协进自行车、手表、制革、医药等30多行业紧缺的铬矿砂5000吨。许多参与活动的企业家从横向的广阔视野中看到：镑地市场有疲有俏、资金有长有短，是摆脱困境发展生产的一条重要途径。
