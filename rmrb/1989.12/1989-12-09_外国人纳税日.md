    Foreigners' Tax Payment Day
    By Lai Renqiong

    Foreigners who have been working and living in Beijing for a long time must pay their personal income tax between the 1st and 7th of each month at No. 133, East Fourth South Street. This is the location of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau's Overseas Division.

    December 7th was the last day for tax payment this month. By 9:00 AM, cars of various makes were parked along both sides of the alley leading to the Overseas Tax Division. Inside the hall, foreign taxpayers were orderly lined up in queues. Behind the counter, several tax officials were busy entering data from the tax declaration forms into the computer. Almost instantly, the amount of tax the taxpayer needed to pay was clearly displayed on the screen. The procedures of filling out forms, calculating the tax, and making the payment could all be completed within a few minutes. Curiously, I asked about the taxpayers' monthly income and the amount of tax they paid. Deputy Director Yang Zejun politely smiled and said, "I'm sorry, but we cannot disclose that information. We must keep the taxpayers' information confidential."

    The collection of personal income tax from foreigners working and doing business in China began in 1980. Before that, China had almost no regulations on foreign-related taxation. As China's opening up to the outside world expanded, the number of foreigners coming to China for work, business, and economic, technological, and cultural exchanges increased year by year. The number of foreigners paying personal income tax also rose from a few hundred to several thousand.

    Do foreigners in China enjoy any tax incentives? Yang Zejun said that since 1987, China has implemented a special preferential policy for all foreigners paying income tax, which is to collect only 50% of the tax they owe.

    An American who has been working in Beijing for two years told the reporter, "Paying personal income tax is the same everywhere. If I don't pay it in China, I have to pay it in the United States." From the collection situation at the Beijing Overseas Tax Division, it can be seen that most foreigners pay their taxes in accordance with the regulations. Several large Japanese companies in Beijing and some companies that have commissioned international accounting firms to handle tax collection are all actively and proactively cooperating with the tax authorities, and many people pay their taxes well.

    Are there any foreigners who evade or underreport taxes? Director Wang Changzhu said, "There are some, especially among foreigners with high mobility. Currently, we are taking measures to gradually improve the collection and management methods to solve the problem of tax evasion and underreporting as soon as possible."

### 外国人纳税日

    外国人纳税日
    本报记者　赖仁琼
    在北京工作、居住已久的外国人，每月1至7日，都要到东四南大街甲133号交纳个人所得税。这里是北京市税务局对外分局。
    12月7日，是当月纳税的最后一天。上午9点多，对外税务分局的胡同两旁，一辆接一辆地停放着各种牌号的小轿车。大厅里，交税的外国人井然有序地排成队。柜台内，几名税务人员正在计算机前紧张忙碌，他们将纳税申报单上的各项逐一输入电脑，即刻，纳税人应交纳税款数额便在荧光屏上清晰地显示出来。填表、计算、付款等手续在几分钟内便可完成。我好奇地问及纳税人月收入及税款数额，副所长杨泽军礼貌地笑笑：“对不起，无可奉告，我们要为纳税人保密。”
    向来华工作、经商的外国人征收个人所得税始于1980年。在此之前，我国涉外税收几乎是一片空白。随着我国对外开放的不断扩大，来华工作、经商和从事经济技术、文化交流等活动的外国人逐年增多。交纳个人所得税的外国人也由最初的二三百人增至目前的数千人。
    外国人在华纳税是否享受某些优惠呢？杨泽军说，从1987年起，我国对所有交纳所得税的外国人实行特殊优惠政策，即只征收应交纳税金的50％。
    一位已在北京工作两年的美国人对记者说：“交纳个人所得税，各国都一样。我不在中国交，也得在美国交。”从北京对外税务分局征收情况来看，多数外国人都能照章纳税。日本在京的几家大公司和委托几家国际会计师公司代办征税的一些公司，都能积极、主动与税务部门配合，不少人纳税较好。
    外国人中有无偷、漏税的呢？所长王长柱说：“也有，特别是流动性较大的外国人中，漏税的不少。目前，我们正在采取措施，逐步完善征管征收办法，以尽快解决偷漏税问题。”
