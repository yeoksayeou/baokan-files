Putian is a coastal open city with a dense population and a large number of overseas Chinese. As the policy of opening up to the outside world deepens, some decadent capitalist ideas have taken advantage of the situation. Feudal superstitions, gambling, and the buying and selling of marriages have become prevalent, negatively impacting young militia members.

In response to these issues, the Putian Military Sub-district of Fujian Province began promoting the "Four-Have" militia activity in 1986, focusing on having ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. By May of this year, over 5,200 militia members in the city had received the "Four-Have" militia honor certificate. Their experiences were shared at the Fujian Provincial Coastal Defense Militia Political Work Conference.

The "Four-Have" education, with a focus on patriotism and collectivism, was conducted. Considering the highly dispersed nature of the militia, they utilized the publication "China's Militia" and educational journals created by county and district military sub-districts for correspondence courses, ensuring each core militia member received a copy. They also organized reading and lecture activities.

The "Four-Have" activity was integrated into various aspects of work. The main focus was on five combinations: First, directly combining with economic construction. The city's militia members who are specialized households and individual entrepreneurs have developed to 9,842, adhering to the law to become wealthy and becoming an important force in economic construction; Second, combining with the completion of urgent, difficult, dangerous, and important tasks. The city's militia participated in 353 disaster relief and urgent tasks; Third, combining with the "Five Promotes, Five Opposes" campaign proposed by the Fujian Provincial Committee, promoting scientific advancement, opposing feudal superstitions; promoting healthy entertainment, opposing gambling; promoting marital freedom, opposing the buying and selling of marriages; promoting neighborhood harmony, opposing clan disputes; promoting hard work and entrepreneurship, opposing extravagance and waste; Fourth, combining with the "Youth Militia Home" activity, restoring and establishing 729 youth militia homes across the city, organizing healthy and beneficial cultural activities; Fifth, combining with the completion of militia military training, war preparedness duties, organization, and recruitment, promoting the implementation of militia and reserve work.

Emphasis was placed on the evaluation of "Four-Have" militia members. Each year, evaluations are conducted in conjunction with militia military training and organizational work. Those evaluated as "Four-Have" militia members receive an honor certificate, and grassroots units provide appropriate material rewards based on the situation.

A system of planning, reporting, inspection, and evaluation was established to ensure the "Four-Have" activity is solid and effective.

    莆田开展“四有民兵”活动
    莆田市是沿海开放城市，人口密集，海外华侨多。随着对外开放的深入发展，一些资本主义腐朽思想乘机而入，封建迷信、聚众赌博、买卖婚姻等歪风邪气抬头，对青年民兵产生了消极影响。
    针对这些情况，福建省莆田军分区从一九八六年开始在民兵中开展争当有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的“四有民兵”活动，截至今年五月，全市已有五千二百多名民兵获得
  “四有民兵”荣誉证书。他们的经验在福建省海防民兵政治工作会议上作过介绍。
    进行以爱国主义和集体主义为主要内容的“四有”教育。根据民兵高度分散的特点，他们利用《中国民兵》和县区人武部创办的教育专刊进行刊授，每期印发基干民兵人手一份；组织读书、演讲活动。
    把“四有”活动贯穿到各项工作中去。主要抓五个结合：一是同经济建设直接结合。全市民兵专业户、个体户已发展到九千八百四十二个，他们坚持守法致富，成为经济建设的一支重要力量；二是同完成急难险重任务相结合。全市民兵参加抢险救灾，完成急难险重任务三百五十三次；三是同福建省委提出的开展“五提倡、五反对”活动相结合，即提倡崇尚科学，反对封建迷信；提倡健康娱乐，反对聚众赌博；提倡婚姻自由，反对买卖婚姻；提倡村邻和睦，反对宗族纠纷；提倡艰苦创业，反对铺张浪费；四是同“青年民兵之家”活动相结合，全市恢复建立了“青年民兵之家”七百二十九个，开展健康有益的文娱活动；五是同完成民兵军事训练、战备执勤、整组、征兵相结合，促进民兵、预备役工作落实。
    抓好“四有民兵”评比活动。每年结合民兵军事训练、整组进行评比，被评为“四有民兵”的发给荣誉证书，基层单位视情况给予一定的物质奖励。
    建立一套计划、汇报、检查和评比制度，使“四有”活动扎扎实实，卓有成效。
