The report of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party on the current economic situation of our country is convincing. It fully affirms the achievements while realistically assessing the difficulties. The results of our country's rectification and austerity measures over the past year are evident. From the perspective of the entire process of rectification and austerity, these achievements are stage-specific and limited to some superficial goals.

The goals of our country's rectification and austerity include: (1) gradually eliminating inflation and reducing the price increase rate to below 10%; (2) gradually eliminating excessive currency issuance and making currency issuance commensurate with economic growth; (3) increasing revenue and reducing expenditures, practicing thrift, and gradually eliminating fiscal deficits; (4) adjusting product and industrial structures, vigorously developing agriculture, energy, raw materials, and transportation and postal industries; (5) enhancing enterprise quality, improving product quality, and increasing economic efficiency; (6) perfecting and adjusting reform measures to establish a stable and coordinated economic order for sustained development. These six goals are all important, closely related, and interdependent. They are unified and indispensable. However, relatively speaking, the first three goals are superficial. As long as the astringent macroeconomic policies are persisted with to a certain extent, they will be effective. The latter three goals are deep-seated. Their effectiveness not only requires a relatively long period but also cannot be achieved solely through total quantity astringent policies. Only when both superficial and deep-seated goals show significant results can we say that the task of rectification and austerity has been basically completed, and our national economy can truly transition to a virtuous cycle.

Currently, the deep-seated goals of rectification and austerity are not yet significantly effective. First, the irrational economic structure has not improved, and the imbalance between departments has not changed significantly. The imbalance between agriculture and industry, and between basic industries and processing industries, remains prominent. The tendency of regional industrial structure convergence and mutual blockade has intensified during the astringent period. The process of rationalizing product and consumption structures has just begun. Second, economic efficiency has declined. In the first ten months of this year, the realized profits and taxes of state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget decreased compared to the same period last year, the losses of loss-making enterprises increased, comparable product costs were overspent, and the funds occupied by finished products increased sharply. Third, the adjustment of interest relationships is progressing slowly, and the situation where the central government's macro-control ability is constrained by limited financial resources has not improved. This indicates that the work of rectification and austerity still needs to develop from shallow to deep.

For this reason, the achieved results of rectification and austerity are also not very solid. For example, the control of inflation is effective, but the monthly decline in the price increase rate is achieved through fiscal price subsidies, value-preserving savings, and administrative price stabilization measures. Any relaxation in these three measures could reverse the stable price trend. To achieve this goal, a deep-seated rectification and austerity foundation is necessary, such as basic balance in total quantity and structural adjustment. In between, the various reforms surrounding the tasks of rectification and austerity must be perfected and deepened. It is clear that in the work of rectification and austerity, not only should the goals be clear, but the measures to achieve these goals should also be coordinated.

The reason we need to carry out rectification and austerity is multifaceted, but the most fundamental reason is that our national economy has experienced severe imbalances since the second half of 1984. First, there is a mismatch between total supply and total demand. Due to total demand exceeding total supply for several consecutive years, the supply-demand gap has been widening. The imbalance between total demand and total supply is mainly due to fiscal imbalances and the mismatch between credit and currency issuance with the actual needs of the national economy. From the supply side, it is mainly due to the irrational departmental structure, regional structure, product structure, and enterprise structure. This has led to the accumulation of products in long-line departments, long-line products, and long-line enterprises, resulting in the waste of limited resources, while causing excessive demand in short-line departments and short-line products. The result is that inflationary factors are hidden on both the supply and demand sides.

However, the imbalance in total quantity and structural imbalance also have deep-seated institutional causes, which is the change in the distribution pattern of national income and the rapid adjustment of the resulting interest pattern. So far, our economic system reform has basically been carried out along the main line of decentralizing power and benefits to enterprises and localities. Coupled with the short-termism of our enterprises in distribution, the result is that our national income distribution has two biases: one is from the state to enterprises and residents. Since the reform, the share of enterprises and residents in national income has been continuously increasing, while the share of the state in national income has been decreasing year by year; the other is from the central government to local governments. In recent years, not only has the share of national fiscal revenue in national income been continuously decreasing (approximately 22% in 1988), but the share of central budget revenue in total fiscal revenue has also been continuously decreasing (approximately 47% in 1988). Under the condition that the price system is not rational, the decentralization of national income distribution will inevitably lead to two results: one is that decentralized income will flow to departments with high prices and high profits, and to processing industries and small projects that are quick to start and see quick results, resulting in the deterioration of industrial structure and enterprise organizational structure; the other is that the central government's control ability is weakened, and there is not enough financial power to develop short-line departments and basic industries.

Therefore, the fundamental focus of our rectification and austerity must be on gradually rectifying the imbalanced proportions of the national economy, including structural relationships and the proportions of national income distribution. This is because, on the one hand, our rectification and austerity and deepening of reforms are aimed at making the national economy move towards a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development; on the other hand, coordination is the prerequisite or foundation for sustained and stable development. Theory and practice have repeatedly proven that without coordination, and being forced to adjust under the compulsion of objective economic laws, we will inevitably experience the large fluctuations we always want to avoid but find difficult to avoid, which will neither be sustained nor stable, ultimately resulting in serious losses.

To grasp the fundamental goals in rectification and austerity, we should focus on the following three points. (1) Adjust product and industrial structures, vigorously develop agriculture, energy, raw materials, and transportation and communication industries. During the adjustment period, we must truly decide to implement a "tilted" policy according to the requirements of industrial policies, allocating limited energy, raw materials, and funds to short-line departments and excellent enterprises. (2) Adjust interest relationships. Currently, it is necessary to increase central financial power and appropriately raise the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in total fiscal revenue. Only in this way can the central government's unified control ability during the rectification and austerity period be increased. (3) Perfect reform measures. The formation of the decentralized pattern of national income is related to the reform approach that relies solely on the "decentralization of power and benefits" policy, while neglecting the establishment of a unified and effective macro-control system. To ensure the smooth progress of rectification and austerity, we must perfect and adjust certain reform measures. Those reform measures that were effective in the previous period but also had defects, such as the contract responsibility system, should be gradually perfected on a stable basis; those measures that are not conducive to appropriately strengthening centralized and unified management during the adjustment period should be selected for those with a smaller scope of impact and quick results, and be resolutely adjusted. In addition, we should strengthen the coordination of macro-control measures and give full play to the complementary roles of administrative, legal, and economic means.

Our rectification and austerity have reached a critical moment. We should neither relax because the astringent policies have achieved initial results nor hesitate because the astringent policies have encountered some new difficulties. Victory often comes with just a little more effort. It should be noted that the decline in production and market sluggishness have indeed brought some difficulties to production, circulation, and finance, but this is also the manifestation of the effectiveness of astringent policies. The decline in total quantity and market sluggishness brought about by astringent policies provide opportunities for structural adjustment. Only by persisting with astringency can we promote product innovation and the further initiation of the structural adjustment mechanism, and drive the industrial structure and other major economic proportions towards a rational direction. In a sense, the decline in production and market sluggishness are indispensable environments for structural adjustment. Because first, market sluggishness will promote competition among enterprises. Some enterprises with high consumption and poor quality will have to close down, especially those in long-line industries that have been started blindly and in a rush in recent years will have to convert production or stop production. If combined with the enterprise merger mechanism, strengthening mergers and acquisitions, and the effective utilization of asset stock and personnel placement will be less of a problem. Second, market sluggishness and weak sales will promote product innovation and technological innovation in enterprises. To occupy a certain share in the sluggish market, enterprises must either reduce costs through technological innovation to win with high quality and low prices, or create new products and open up new markets.

Another reason to persist with astringent policies is that the current market sluggishness has appeared without a significant change in the pattern of total demand exceeding total supply. Therefore, it has a temporary and partial nature. The large amount of excess economic currency issuance caused by long-term excessive national income distribution has not been truly digested. Some of it has been attracted to the bank by value-preserving savings, and some of it has been retained by residents due to the influence of the "buy high, not low" consumption behavior. The huge surplus purchasing power is always a potential threat to the market. At this time, if the astringent policies are abandoned, the situation of "one release, one inflation, and structural regression" will reoccur. It should be pointed out that during astringency, we should adopt certain flexible measures based on new situations and new problems to promote the appropriate increase of effective supply, so as to stabilize the economy and the market. However, this flexibility should not shake our astringent policy. In this regard, we have had successful experiences and also lessons from mistakes.

    坚持紧缩政策　注重结构调整
    孙尚清
    党的十三届五中全会公报对我国当前经济形势的分析是令人信服的，既充分肯定了成绩，又如实估计了困难。我国一年来治理整顿的成效是明显的。从治理整顿的全过程看，这些成果是阶段性效应，且限于一些浅层目标。
    我国治理整顿的目标包括：（1）逐渐消除通货膨胀，使物价上涨率下降到10％以下；（2）逐渐消除货币超量发行，使货币发行与经济增长相适应；（3）增收节支，厉行节约，逐渐消除财政赤字；（4）调整产品结构和产业结构，大力发展农业、能源工业、原材料工业和交通邮电业；（5）增强企业素质，改进产品质量，提高经济效益；
  （6）完善和调整改革措施，建立持续稳定协调发展的经济秩序。这六项目标都很重要，相互密切联系，相互制约，是统一的，缺一不可的。但相对而言，前三项目标是浅层的，只要紧缩性的宏观经济政策坚持到一定程度，就会见效。后三项目标是深层的，它们的见效不仅需要较长的时间，而且仅靠总量紧缩政策是不够的。只有浅层和深层目标都有明显成效，才能说基本上完成治理整顿的任务，我国国民经济才可能真正向良性循环转轨。
    目前，治理整顿的深层目标见效尚不十分显著。第一，经济结构不合理的状况没有好转，部门结构失衡没有明显改变，工农业之间、基础工业与加工工业之间的不协调仍旧十分突出；地区产业结构的趋同现象和相互封锁在紧缩期尚有某种加重的趋势；产品结构与消费结构的合理化过程也刚刚开始。第二，经济效益有所下降。今年前十个月，预算内国营工业企业实现利税比去年同期下降，亏损企业亏损额比去年同期增长，可比产品成本超支，产成品资金占用猛增。第三，利益关系的调整步履维艰，中央宏观调控能力受有限财力制约的局面尚未改观。这表明，治理整顿工作尚待由浅入深地发展。
    正因为如此，已经取得的治理整顿效果也不可能十分牢靠，比如通货膨胀的控制是见效的，但物价涨幅的逐月回落，一是靠财政的价格补贴，二是靠保值储蓄，另外还运用了行政稳价手段。这三个手段中的任一个如有松动，都有可能使物价的稳势发生逆转。为完成此项目标，则必须有深层治理整顿的基础，例如总量上的基本平衡，结构上的调整，其间又必须有环绕治理整顿任务的各项改革的完善和深化。可见，在治理整顿工作中，不仅要明确目标，而且要适应这些目标的内在统一性，在达成目标的措施上相互配套。
    我们所以要进行治理整顿，原因固然很多，但最基本的原因是我国国民经济1984年下半年以来出现了严重的比例失调。首先是总供给与总需求的失调。由于总需求连续几年大量超出总供给，使供需缺口越来越大。而总需求与总供给的失衡，从需求的方面看主要是由于财政收支不平衡以及信贷、货币投放量与国民经济实际需要量失调引起的。从供给的角度看，则主要是部门结构、地区结构、产品结构和企业结构不合理。造成长线部门、长线产品、长线企业产品积压，从而带来有限资源的浪费，同时又造成短线部门、短线产品的需求过旺。结果是从供求两方面潜藏着通货膨胀的潜在因素。
    然而，总量失衡与结构失调还有其深刻的体制原因，这就是国民收入分配格局的变动以及由此决定的利益格局的调整过快。迄今为止，我国经济体制改革基本上是沿着对企业、地方扩权让利这条主线展开的，再加上我国企业在分配上的短期化，结果，我国国民收入的分配出现了两个倾斜，一是从国家向企业、居民手中的倾斜。改革以来，我国企业、居民所得在国民收入中所占的份额持续上升，而国家在国民收入中的份额则逐年下降；二是由中央向地方的倾斜。近年来，不仅国家财政收入占国民收入的份额不断降低（1988年约为22％），中央预算内收入占整个财政收入的比重也不断下降（1988年约为47％）。在价格体系不合理的状况没有改变的情况下，国民收入分配的分散化势必导致两个结果，一是分散了的收入将流向价高利大的部门和上马快、见效快的加工工业和小型项目，结果恶化了产业结构和企业组织结构，二是中央调控能力减弱，没有足够的财力去发展那些短线部门和基础产业。
    因此，我们治理整顿的根本着眼点必须放在逐渐将失调的国民经济比例关系理顺，包括理顺结构关系和国民收入分配比例。这是由于，一方面我们治理整顿和深化改革是为了使国民经济走上持续稳定协调发展的轨道；另一方面，协调又是持续稳定发展的前提或基础。理论和实践反复证明，如果没有协调，而要在客观经济规律的强制下被迫调整，势必造成我们总想避免又难于避免的大起大落，既不能持续，也不能稳定，最终造成严重的损失。
    为了在治理整顿中抓住根本性目标，我们就应抓好以下三点。（1）调整产品结构和产业结构，大力发展农业、能源、原材料工业和交通、通讯业。在调整时期，要真正下决心按产业政策的要求实行“倾斜”政策，把有限的能源、原材料、资金分配给短线部门和优良企业。（2）调整利益关系。当前必须增加中央财力，适当提高财政收入占国民收入的比重和中央财政收入占整个财政收入的比重，只有这样，才能增加中央在治理整顿期间统一调控的能力。（3）完善改革措施。国民收入分散格局的形成是与单纯依靠“放权让利给政策”，而忽视建立统一、有效的宏观调控体系的改革思路有关的。为了治理整顿工作的顺利进行，就要完善和调整某些改革措施。那些前一段行之有效、但也有缺陷的改革措施，如承包制，要在稳定的基础上，逐渐地予以完善；那些调整期间不利于适当加强集中统一管理的措施，选择那些改变涉及面较小，见效又快的，坚决地进行调整。另外要加强宏观调控措施的配套，发挥行政、法律与经济手段的互补作用。
    我们的治理整顿已经到了一个关键时刻。我们既不能因为紧缩政策已取得了初步成效而放松，也不能因为紧缩政策遇到了一些新的困难而却步，胜利往往出现在再坚持一下的努力之中。应该看到，生产下降、市场疲软固然给生产、流通和财政带来了一些困难，但这却是紧缩政策着力和见效的表现。总量紧缩带来的生产下降和市场疲软，为结构调整提供了机会。只有坚持紧缩，才利于产品创新、结构调整机制的进一步启动，促使产业结构和其它重大经济比例关系向合理的方向转变。从某种意义上说，生产下降和市场疲软是结构调整不可缺少的环境。因为第一，市场疲软将促进企业间的竞争，一些消耗高、质量差的企业就要垮下来，特别是这几年盲目上马，一哄而上的长线行业中的一些企业就不得不转产或停产，如结合企业兼并机制，加强并转，资产存量的有效利用和人员安置上的问题就少些。第二，市场疲软、销售不旺将促进企业的产品创新和工艺创新。企业要在不旺的市场中占有一定的份额，要么是通过技术革新降低成本，从而以优质低价取胜，要么要创造新的产品，开拓新的市场。
    坚持紧缩政策的另一个理由是，目前的市场疲软是在总需求大于总供给的格局并没有明显改变的情况下出现的，因此带有暂时性和局部性。长期的国民收入超额分配造成的大量超经济发行的货币并未真正消化，有的是被保值储蓄吸引到银行，有的是因“买涨不买落”的消费行为影响而保留在居民手中。巨额结余购买力对市场始终是一个潜在的威胁。这时如若放弃紧缩政策，将重新陷入一放就涨、结构复归的局面。应当指出，紧缩中要根据新情况和新问题采取一定的灵活措施，促使有效供给的适度增加，以稳定经济和稳定市场。但是，这种灵活性决不应动摇我们紧缩的方针。在这方面我们有过成功的经验，也有过失误的教训。
