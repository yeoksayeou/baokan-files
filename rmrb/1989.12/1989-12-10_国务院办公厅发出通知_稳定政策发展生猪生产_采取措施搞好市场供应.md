The State Council Office recently issued a notice regarding the forwarding of a report from the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Finance, emphasizing the need to stabilize pork production and ensure a steady supply of pork in the market.

The State Council Office's notice points out that stabilizing pork production and ensuring a steady supply of pork in the market are not only crucial for maintaining farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs but also for stabilizing the economy, the market, and the smooth implementation of rectification and reform work. Various regions and relevant departments must treat this as a major task and handle it seriously. This year, some regions have experienced a reduction in corn yields, which is not conducive to the development of pork production. Local governments must stabilize policies for raising pigs and take timely measures to prevent a decline in pork production. They should implement the requirements and measures proposed in the report in accordance with their own regional and departmental situations.

The Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Finance submitted the following opinions to the State Council:

1. Stable pig-raising policies and support for pork production. The various policies and measures to encourage and support pork production by the central and local governments should remain unchanged. Local governments must maintain the stability of policies linking pork with feed grain, feed land, and fertilizers, as well as the "industry-subsidizing-pig" policy, to protect the enthusiasm of producers for raising pigs. Since 1987, the state has allocated 3 billion yuan annually to support the production of meat, poultry, and eggs, and to arrange for 300,000 tons of feed grain price subsidies for the pork market, which will continue until 1990. Special funds for the development of commercial lean meat pig bases will also be allocated in 1990. While encouraging households to raise pigs, support should also be given to pig-raising bases, key farms, and specialized households for pork production.

2. Expand feed sources and ensure feed supply. Southern provinces (regions) should actively utilize winter fallow fields and water surfaces to expand feed cultivation, develop green and coarse feed, and increase feed sources. Feed industry enterprises should adhere to low-profit operations, improve product quality, reduce production costs, increase output, and ensure feed supply. Effective feed grain inter-regional variety adjustment, allocation, and transportation work should be carried out, and the allocation of corn to some major pork-producing provinces in the south should be ensured.

3. Promote scientific and technological advancements to improve pig-raising standards. Local governments should establish scientific pig-raising demonstration points suitable for local conditions to promote scientific pig-raising among the masses, actively use new technologies, and vigorously promote the use of superior breeds and compound feed. Standardized feeding management should be implemented to increase the rate of pigs reaching market weight. Effective epidemic prevention work should be carried out to reduce mortality rates. Northern provinces (regions) should actively renovate pigsties and gradually popularize warm pigsty pig-raising technology.

4. Strengthen price guidance for live pigs and regulate market order. Local governments should maintain a reasonable pig-to-grain price ratio. The 1990 guiding price for live pig purchases should be set at a ratio of 1:5 to 1:5.5, depending on local conditions. The guiding price for lean meat pigs should be higher than the general live pig purchase price. Funds for live pig purchases should be arranged to solve the problem of "white receipts" for pig purchases. To ensure the healthy development of multi-channel operations and the stability of the pork market, and to protect the interests of producers, consumers, and operators, local governments should strengthen the management of urban and rural meat markets.

5. Improve pork reserves and allocation work, and play the leading role of state-owned commerce. Provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and large and medium-sized cities should establish and improve pork reserve systems based on local conditions, and implement peak season storage and off-season sales. Currently, key sales areas should increase imports and expand reserves to support production areas. State-owned food enterprises should actively engage in live pig purchase and sales under the leadership and support of local governments, and adjust and stabilize market prices. Efforts should be made to guide the adjustment of meat consumption structure, gradually increase the proportion of meat products with lower grain consumption, and enrich market supply.

    稳定政策发展生猪生产  采取措施搞好市场供应
    新华社北京12月9日电　国务院办公厅最近就转发商业部、农业部、财政部的报告发出通知，强调要稳定生猪生产和搞好猪肉市场供应。
    国务院办公厅的通知指出，稳定生猪生产，搞好猪肉市场供应，不仅关系到稳定农民养猪的积极性，而且关系到稳定经济、稳定市场和治理整顿工作的顺利进行，各地区、各有关部门必须当做一件大事认真抓好。今年一些地区玉米减产，对生猪生产的发展不利。各地要稳定养猪政策，及早采取措施，防止生猪生产下滑。要按照报告中提出的要求和措施，结合本地区、本部门的实际情况，切实加以落实。
    商业部、农业部、财政部在给国务院的报告中提出如下意见：
    一、稳定养猪政策，扶持生猪生产。中央和地方鼓励和扶持生猪生产的各项政策措施都不要变动。各地要保持生猪与饲料粮、饲料地、化肥挂钩以及“以工补猪”等政策的稳定，以保护生产者的养猪积极性。1987年以来，国家每年用于扶持肉禽蛋生产和安排猪肉市场的30亿公斤饲料粮差价款，继续执行到1990年；发展商品瘦肉型猪基地的专项投资，1990年继续拨给。在鼓励千家万户养猪的同时，要积极支持养猪基地、重点场、专业户的生猪生产。
    二、广辟饲料来源，搞好饲料供应。南方各省（区）要积极利用冬闲田和水面，扩大饲料种植，发展青粗饲料，增加饲料来源。饲料工业企业要坚持微利经营，提高产品质量，降低生产成本，努力增加产量，搞好饲料供应。要切实搞好饲料粮地区间的品种调剂、调拨运输工作，切实安排好对南方一些生猪主产省的玉米调入。
    三、推广科学技术，提高养猪水平。各地要因地制宜地建立一批科学养猪示范点，带动广大农户科学养猪，积极使用新技术。要大力推广良种和饲喂配合饲料，推行规范化饲养管理，提高出栏率。要切实加强防疫工作，降低死亡率。北方各省（区）要积极改造猪舍，逐步普及暖舍养猪配套技术。
    四、加强生猪价格指导，整顿市场秩序。各地要保持合理的猪粮比价，明年生猪指导性收购价格，根据各地不同情况，应按1∶5至1∶5.5的水平掌握。瘦肉型猪指导性收购价格，要高于一般生猪收购价格。要安排好生猪收购资金，切实解决收猪打“白条”的问题。为保证多渠道经营的健康发展和猪肉市场的稳定，维护生产者、消费者、经营者的利益，各地要加强对城乡肉食市场的管理。
    五、搞好猪肉储备和调拨工作，发挥国营商业的主渠道作用。各省、自治区、直辖市和大中城市要根据当地的实际情况，建立和完善猪肉储备制度，搞好旺储淡销。当前，重点销区要增加调进，扩大库存，以支持产区生产。国营食品企业要在当地政府的领导和支持下，积极开展生猪购销业务，吞吐调剂，平抑市价。要积极引导肉类消费结构的调整，逐步提高耗粮少的肉食品消费比重，丰富市场供应。
