Antarctica is covered in ice and snow, yet it is home to numerous volcanoes. All of Antarctica's volcanoes are located in West Antarctica. The most famous among them is the active Erebus volcano. It stands in the center of Ross Island, with an elevation of 3,795 meters, towering over the icy landscape. A massive plume of smoke billows from its crater, creating a spectacular sight.

The Erebus volcano was first discovered by British explorer James Clark Ross in 1841. He named it after his ship. Erebus is derived from Greek mythology, meaning "the path to the underworld," indicating the extreme danger of the area. However, many are still willing to venture there despite the risks. Ten years ago, a New Zealand passenger plane carrying 260 people crashed while flying around the volcano's crater, resulting in the loss of all on board.

Ross Island has at least four volcanic craters, and nearby islands also have volcanic activity. Across from Ross Island lies Deception Island, which has at least 25 volcanic vents. The Marie Byrd Land region has 28 layered volcanic craters, surrounded by 29 parasitic craters. The abundance of volcanoes suggests that future Antarctic explorers might be able to utilize these volcanoes for heating and constructing greenhouses, providing a favorable condition for conquering the Antarctic.

    南极火山多
    南极遍地冰雪，却火山成群。南极的火山全都分布在西南极。其中最著名的是埃里伯斯活火山。它位于罗斯岛的中部，海拔3795米，在冰天雪地中矗立，巨大的烟柱从火山口喷出，十分壮观。
    埃里伯斯火山是英国探险家罗斯在1841年首先发现的，他用所乘的船名给它命名。埃里伯斯源于希腊神话，意思是“黄泉之路”，说明那里非常危险。但甘愿去那里冒险的却大有人在。10年前，一架新西兰客机满载游客围绕火山口飞行而失事，机上260人全部命归黄泉。
    罗斯岛上至少有四个火山口，在它附近的一些岛上也都有火山分布。罗斯岛对岸的德莱巴雷，至少有25个火山喷口，而马里伯德地有28个成层火山口，四周还有29个寄生火山口。这么多的火山给人以启示：将来在南极探险的人们，也许可以从火山那里获得供暖和建造温室的热源，这将为征服南极提供一个有利的条件。
