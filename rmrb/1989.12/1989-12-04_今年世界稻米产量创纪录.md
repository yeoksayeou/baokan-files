The Argentine Rice Producers Association recently announced that this year's world rice production has hit a record high, reaching 478 million tons.

The reasons for the increased rice production this year are twofold: first, the price of rice rose in 1988, and second, Asia received abundant rainfall, particularly in the two major rice-producing countries, Thailand and India, where rice production increased by 5% compared to last year.

The association warned that despite the increase in production, rice consumption has exceeded supply, and stockpiles are at their lowest level since 1976.

According to the association's estimates, this year's global rice trade volume will account for 7% of the total production, approximately 13.3 million tons.

    今年世界稻米产量创纪录
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯电　阿根廷稻米生产者协会最近宣布，今年世界稻米产量创纪录，达4.78亿吨。
    今年稻米增产的原因，一是1988年米价上扬，二是亚洲的雨量充沛，特别是两个主要产米国泰国和印度，其稻米产量比去年增产5％。
    该协会警告说，尽管增产，但稻米消费量超出供给量，库存量低于去年，是自1976年以来的最低水平。
    据该协会估计，今年世界稻米贸易量将占总产量的7％，约1330万吨。
