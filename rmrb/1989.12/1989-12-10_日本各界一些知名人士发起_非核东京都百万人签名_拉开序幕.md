A campaign for "Non-Nuclear Tokyo 1 Million Signatures" was launched today at noon in the bustling streets of Nakano, Nakano Station, Tokyo. The campaign was initiated by 46 prominent figures from various sectors in Japan, including House of Councillors member Tsutomu Utsunomiya, renowned actresses Yumi Arai, and Ayako Fuji.

The large-scale signature campaign aims to completely ban the production, deployment, and storage of nuclear weapons within Tokyo, halt the establishment of all nuclear weapon-related facilities, and prevent the construction of nuclear power plants.

One of the campaign's initiators, economist Mitsuo Sumiya, stated that declaring Tokyo, the capital of Japan, a non-nuclear city would have a significant impact not only on peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region but also on global peace and stability.

According to the organizers, by next August, they plan to collect signatures from 1 million Tokyo residents and submit a "Non-Nuclear Tokyo Declaration" to the governor and the metropolitan assembly, urging them to make Tokyo a nuclear-free city.
