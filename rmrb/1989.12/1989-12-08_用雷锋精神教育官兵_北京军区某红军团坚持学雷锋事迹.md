At a meeting of the Party Committee of a certain Red Army Regiment in the Beijing Military Region, Party Secretary Li Shubin remarked with deep emotion: "Even under the conditions of a commodity economy, the construction of the army still needs the spirit of Lei Feng." Therefore, the regiment's Party Committee decided to make the study and promotion of the spirit of Lei Feng an important part of the regiment's ideological construction.

After a period of carrying out the study of Lei Feng, some soldiers said that Lei Feng was a great communist warrior of the 1960s, and that they were too far removed from him, and for a time, they developed a dislike for learning. This matter caused the regiment's Party Committee to reflect deeply. They believed that during the decade of turmoil, some people had exaggerated Lei Feng into an unattainable figure, making him a model that was respected but unattainable. To carry out the study of Lei Feng in depth, it was necessary to restore Lei Feng's true image. The regiment's Party Committee, in response to some soldiers' tendency to seek pleasure, timely used Lei Feng's deeds to educate the soldiers to establish a spirit of hard work and self-reliance. They made slides of Lei Feng's thrifty and frugal deeds and showed them throughout the regiment. Various company Party branches held discussions on Lei Feng's stories of saving his allowance to support national construction, introduced the deeds of the Machine Gun Company, which had been working hard for more than a decade, and organized everyone to visit the Machine Gun Company's exhibition on hard work. These vivid and realistic educations made everyone feel that the spirit of Lei Feng was something that young people in the new era should seriously study, and that young people should still take pride in hard work. With the promotion of the spirit of hard work, the bread and rice that used to appear in the slop bucket disappeared, and the soldiers spontaneously formed repair groups and mending groups, using their Sundays to repair camp equipment, mend clothes and shoes, or go out to do good deeds.

Near the garrison, there is a labor re-education camp. Over the past year, to save the wayward youth, this regiment has consistently sent officers and soldiers from the advanced collective of the Machine Gun Company, led by the first-class merit winner and political instructor Sun Changwang, to the camp to carry out educational activities. They donated books such as "The Story of Lei Feng" and "Becoming a 'Four-Haves' New Person" to the wayward youth and guided the labor education students to read. Some wayward individuals thought that Lei Feng was a hero, while they were criminals, and that Lei Feng was unattainable. The officers and soldiers told them about their own growth experiences and their understanding of learning from Lei Feng, and through various forms of help, they received profound education, saving their numb souls. They decided to become new people, bid farewell to the past, and move towards a new life.

This unit, in the course of studying Lei Feng, insisted on going out of the camp and into society. The Machine Gun Company's Lei Feng study group has been taking care of the blind and widowed old man, Yang Xizi, in Beidaxiang Village near the garrison for five years. They often bathe him, wash his bedding, buy grain and vegetables, carry water, sweep the yard, and during the Spring Festival, they invite the old man to the company for a "reunion." The soldiers also donated money to buy a radio and a quilt for the old man, allowing this unfortunate old man to spend his later years in happiness. The old man would tell everyone: "These children are all like Lei Feng!"

In late May of this year, this unit was ordered to enter the capital to carry out martial law duties and was responsible for the security of Tiananmen Square. After the unit's Party Committee further used the spirit of Lei Feng to educate the soldiers, they required everyone to create the image of a "civilized army" and a "mighty army" with good behavior in the heart of the motherland. Under the tense situation of performing duties, they vigorously carried out the study of Lei Feng. When the unit was stationed in Zhongshan Park, the officers and soldiers consciously protected the park's trees and ancient buildings, and actively sent people to help the park repair 270 meters of flower walls, renovate 300 square meters of flower beds, plant 500 square meters of lawn, and remove 130 tons of garbage. During the few months of duty in the square, they helped nearly a thousand lost people; solved difficulties for more than 500 people, and successively picked up 232 items of lost property, all of which were returned to the owners or handed over to the relevant departments. One day, political instructor Zhu Changqing was on duty at the Qianmen Gate and found a child of about ten years old looking very frightened. He asked about the situation. It turned out that the child was from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, and had been kidnapped to Beijing by human traffickers more than three months ago and had just escaped. He didn't know how to go home. Zhu Changqing took the child to the company, brought him food, bought him candy, and quickly found out his family's address. He also used his own money to buy the child a train ticket home.

    用雷锋精神教育官兵
    ——北京军区某红军团坚持学雷锋事迹
    在一次北京军区某部红军团党委会上，党委书记李树斌深有感触地说：在商品经济条件下，部队建设仍然需要雷锋精神。于是，团党委决定，把学习和弘扬雷锋精神作为全团思想建设的重要内容。
    学习雷锋活动开展一段时间后，有的战士说雷锋是60年代的伟大共产主义战士，我们和他相比相差太远，一度产生了厌学情绪。这事引起团党委的深思，他们认为，10年动乱，有人把雷锋夸大成高不可攀的人，成了可敬而不可及的模范人物，要深入开展学雷锋活动，还须还雷锋的本来面目。团党委针对一些战士贪图享乐的现象，及时用雷锋的事迹教育战士树立艰苦奋斗精神。把雷锋勤俭节约的事迹绘成幻灯片在全团放映，各团支部开展讲雷锋节省自己的津贴费用以支援国家建设的故事，介绍机枪一连十几年如一日艰苦奋斗的事迹，组织大家到机枪一连参观艰苦奋斗展览。这些直观真实的教育，使大家感到雷锋精神是新时代青年应当认真学习的，青年人仍应以艰苦奋斗为荣。随着艰苦奋斗精神的发扬，过去泔水缸里经常出现的馒头、米饭不见了，战士们自发组成维修组、缝补组，把星期天的时间用来修理营具，缝衣补鞋或外出做好事。
    驻地附近有座劳动教养所，去年以来，为了挽救失足青少年，这个团坚持派出学雷锋先进集体机枪一连的干部战士，在一等功荣立者、指导员孙长旺的带领下，进所开展帮教活动。他们向失足青少年赠送了《雷锋的故事》、《做“四有”新人》等书籍，并辅导劳教学员阅读。有的失足者认为雷锋是英雄，自己是罪人，高不可攀。干部战士就向他们讲述自己成长的经历和学雷锋的体会，通过多种形式的帮助，使他们受到深刻教育，拯救了麻木的灵魂。他们决心重做新人，告别昨天，走向新生。
    这个部队在学雷锋活动中坚持走出营门，走向社会。一连学雷锋小组5年如一日，热心照料驻地北大冉村双目失明的孤寡老人营喜子，经常给他擦澡，替他拆洗被褥，买粮送菜，担水扫院，逢年过节把老人接到连队“团圆”。战士们还捐款给老人购买了收音机，毛毯，让这位不幸的老人过上了幸福的晚年。老人逢人就说：“这些孩子个个都像雷锋啊！”
    今年5月下旬，这支部队奉命进京执行戒严任务，担任天安门广场执勤警戒任务后，部队党委进一步用雷锋精神教育官兵，要求大家用良好的行为在祖国的心脏塑造出“文明之师”、“威武之师”的形象。他们在执勤任务紧张的情况下，大力开展学习雷锋活动。部队驻在中山公园时，官兵自觉爱护园林花木和古建筑，主动派出人员帮助公园修理花墙270米，整修花圃300平方米，栽种草坪500平方米，清运垃圾130多方。他们在广场执勤几个月，共帮助了近千名迷路的群众；为500多名群众解决了困难，先后拣到群众遗物232件，都退还了失主或上交有关部门。一天，指导员朱长清在前门执勤时，发现一个10多岁的小孩十分惊恐，就上前询问情况。原来小孩是江苏省徐州市人，被人贩子拐到北京已三个多月，刚刚逃了出来，不知怎么回家。朱长清把孩子领到了连队，给他端来了饭菜，买来了糖果，并很快打听到了他家的地址，还用自己的钱给小孩买来了回家的车票。
