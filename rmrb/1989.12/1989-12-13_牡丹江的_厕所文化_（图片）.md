The streets and alleys of our city are adorned with public toilets that are uniquely designed and distinctive, becoming part of the urban architectural ensemble and a decorative element that beautifies the cityscape.

The municipal government regards the construction of public toilets as a window to urban civilization and an integral part of creating a favorable investment environment. To help people establish a "toilet culture" awareness and make the newly built toilets pleasant to approach, even before entering, the city government has, since 1985, allocated 300,000 yuan annually for the construction of public toilets, incorporating this into urban construction regulations. Whenever there is old city renovation or new district development, the city organizes the sanitation bureau to first secure the locations for toilet construction. For existing toilets, if any unit demolishes them, they must pay 4,000 yuan per squat position for reconstruction. According to the city government's plan, the entire city will be divided into 55 residential districts, and public toilets will become indoor facilities. The municipal sanitation bureau also plans to transform the city's 1,885 toilets into 66 public toilets of various types, including water and dry combined heating (top right image), deep pit sealed (left image), multi-story heated flushing (bottom right image), and enterprise wastewater dilution (main image) styles. Currently, 22 have been completed, and management and construction are moving towards the direction of sewage management pipeline, professional cleaning teams, and harmless treatment.

    牡丹江的“厕所文化”
    我市的街边巷尾，一座座造型别致、各具特色的公共厕所，已成为城市建筑群体的组成部分、美化市容的点缀小品。
    市政府把公共厕所建设视为城市文明的窗口，创造良好投资环境的组成部分。为帮助人们树立起“厕所文化”意识，让新建的厕所使人不觉得脏，“未入之，先悦之”。自1985年起，市政府每年拿出30万元用于建设公厕，并纳入城市建设法规中。每当旧城改造，新区开发前，市里都组织环卫局先把建厕所的地方号下来；对原有厕所，哪个单位拆了，必须每个蹲位上交4000元钱用于重建。根据市政府计划将全市规划成55个居民小区，民厕将进入室内的现实，市环卫局也计划将全市的1885座厕所规划成66座水旱两用供热式（右上图）、深坑密闭式（左图）、楼式供热水洗式（右下图）和利用企业废水稀释粪便式的公共厕所（题图）。目前已竣工了22座，管理和建设正朝着粪便管理管道化，清掏队伍专业化和处理无害化方向发展。
