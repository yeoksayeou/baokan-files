American scientists believe that life on Earth originated from organic compounds that rained down from outer space.

Edward Anders of the University of Chicago's Chemistry Department stated that a large number of organic particles from comets and asteroids are slowed down by Earth's atmosphere and land softly on the planet without damage. This organic rain played a crucial role in the origin of life on Earth. The organic compounds mentioned here are not produced by living organisms but are chemically complex carbon compounds. The weight of these particles ranges from one trillionth of a gram to one millionth of a gram.

This organic rain from outer space is now so rare that it is almost non-existent. However, Anders said, the situation was very different 4 billion years ago. During the several billion years between the last major catastrophe on Earth and the beginning of life, approximately 20 grams of organic carbon accumulated on each square centimeter of the Earth's surface.

    地球上生命来自外空有机雨
    美国科学家认为，地球上的生命来源于外层空间的有机雨。
    芝加哥大学化学系的爱德华·安德斯说，来自彗星和小行星的大量有机微粒，被地球大气层减速，完整无损地在地球上软着陆，这种有机雨对地球上生命的起源起十分重要的作用。这里所说的有机物质，不是由生物产生的，而是在化学意义上的复杂的碳水化合物。微粒的重量大约从一万亿分之一克到一百万分之一克。
    这种来自外层空间的有机雨，现在少到几乎不存在。但是，安德斯说，在40亿年前情况就大不相同，从最后一次地球灾变到生命开始这几亿年中，地球表面每平方厘米积累约20克有机碳。（华）
