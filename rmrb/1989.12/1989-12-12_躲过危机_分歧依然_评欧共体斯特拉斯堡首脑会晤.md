The European Community summit held in Strasbourg on December 8-9 had several unusual aspects.

Firstly, the background was extraordinary. The central topic of the meeting was initially set to discuss internal construction. Currently, the realization of a unified European market has entered a critical stage. Economic and monetary integration, as well as the coordination of social policies among the 12 countries, are highly challenging and require the leaders to make decisive decisions. However, the disagreements among several major countries were quite evident. Therefore, several newspapers predicted that this summit would result in a split. It is precisely at this crucial moment in European construction that significant changes have occurred in Eastern Europe, and the direction of the evolution of East-West relations has become the most concerning issue. The issue of German reunification has also forced Western European countries to reflect.

Secondly, although the meeting did not result in a crisis, it did produce two 11:1 situations. Due to Britain's insistence on opposition, the "Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers" (simplified as "Social Charter") was only passed by 11 countries. This document is crucial for the in-depth development of the European Community, and its importance is self-evident. This is the first time that 11 countries have proceeded without Britain in the history of the European Community. Additionally, regarding the European Economic and Monetary Union, 11 countries agreed to convene an intergovernmental conference by the end of 1990 to amend the "Treaty of Rome" and supplement the "Single European Act," while Britain maintained a reserved attitude. Even in the "Eastern Policy" of the European Community, Mrs. Thatcher showed more caution than her partners. European leaders advocating for the acceleration of the European Union were deeply concerned about this.

Thirdly, the issue of German reunification was first included in the official documents of the European Council. Originally, this summit was not intended to discuss this issue. However, on the evening of the 8th, West German Chancellor Kohl insisted that the summit should take a stance on this matter. It is said that after "intense discussions," the summit issued a "Statement on Central and Eastern Europe," and Kohl's wish was granted. According to the West German interpretation, the statement says: "We seek to strengthen the peaceful status of Europe. The German people will regain unity in this status through a free self-determination." According to Western reports, due to the insistence of countries like France, the statement continued: "This process must be realized peacefully, democratically, and in accordance with the agreements, treaties, and all principles established by the Helsinki Final Act, within the context of East-West dialogue and cooperation. It must also be placed within the prospect of European integration." The text is meticulous, adding many limiting words. From these added conditions, people clearly see the complex emotions of other European Community countries towards German reunification.

The current chairman of the European Council, French President Mitterrand, acknowledged at the press conference after the meeting that "a European Council facing so many serious, decisive, and difficult problems as we did this time is very rare." The recent rapid changes in the European situation have caught everyone by surprise, and all parties are assessing the situation and adjusting their positions. Both internally and externally, the European Community faces severe challenges. In this context, although the Strasbourg summit "averted the crisis" and avoided a split, achieving the current results, because the meeting did not eliminate the substantial disagreements within the European Community but rather pushed them to the future, the process of European political and economic integration is difficult and tortuous.

### 躲过危机  分歧依然——评欧共体斯特拉斯堡首脑会晤

    躲过危机  分歧依然
    ——评欧共体斯特拉斯堡首脑会晤
    本报记者　魏崴
    12月8日至9日在斯特拉斯堡召开的欧共体首脑会议，有几个颇不寻常之处。
    首先是背景非同一般。会议的中心议题，最初定的是磋商内部建设。当前，实现欧洲统一大市场已进入攻坚阶段，与之息息相关的经济货币一体化和协调12国社会领域中的政策，难度很大，需要首脑们拍板。但几个大国的分歧十分明显，因此好几家报纸预言，本届会议将出现分裂。而正是在欧洲建设的关键时期，东欧形势近来发生了巨大变化，东西方关系演变的走向成为人们最为关注的问题，两德统一问题也逼迫西欧诸国去思索。
    其次，会议虽未爆发危机，却出现了两个11∶1的局面。由于英国坚持反对，“劳动者基本社会权利共同体宪章”（简称“社会宪章”）只有11国通过。这个文件关系到欧共体的纵深发展，其重要性不言而喻，11国抛开英国，先行一步在欧共体历史上尚属首次。此外，关于欧洲经济与货币联盟，11国同意在1990年年底前召开政府间会议，以便修改《罗马条约》和补充《单一文件》，只有英国持保留态度。即使是在欧共体的“东方政策上”，撒切尔夫人亦比她的伙伴们表现出更多的审慎。主张加速建设欧洲联盟的西欧领导人对此深为不安。
    再者，两德统一问题首次列入欧洲理事会正式文件。本来，此次首脑会是不准备讨论这个问题的。可是8日晚间，西德总理科尔坚持要首脑会就此表态。据称经过了“激烈的讨论”，会议发表了《关于中部和东部欧洲的声明》，科尔如愿以偿。按照西德的意思，《声明》说：“我们谋求欧洲和平状态的加强。德意志人民将在这一状态下通过一种自由的自决，重新获得统一。”另据西方报道，由于法国等国的坚持，《声明》紧接着写道：“这一进程必须和平地、民主地、在尊重赫尔辛基最后文件所确定的协议、条约及其一切原则的情况下，在东西方对话与合作的背景下，加以实现。它还必须置于欧洲一体化的前景之内。”行文不厌其烦，加了许多限定词，从这附加上去的几个条件，人们清楚地看到了欧共体其它国家对两德统一的复杂感情。
    欧洲理事会现任主席、法国总统密特朗在会议结束后举行的记者招待会上承认，“一个欧洲理事会，遇到像我们这次碰到的那么多如此严重、如此具有决定性的、如此艰难的问题，甚为罕见。”欧洲形势近来变化之快，出人意外，各方都在审时度势，调整立场。在内外问题上，欧共体均面临严峻的挑战。在这种形势下，斯特拉斯堡会议虽然“躲过了危机”，避免了分裂，取得现在这样的结果，但因为会议并没有消除欧共体内实质性分歧，而是将它们推给了未来，所以欧洲政治经济一体化的进程，艰难曲折。　（本报斯特拉斯堡12月10日电）
