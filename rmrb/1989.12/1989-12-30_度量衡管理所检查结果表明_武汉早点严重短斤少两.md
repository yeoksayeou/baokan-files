    Editor's Note: The inspection results provided by the Wuhan Municipal Metrology Administration are quite shocking and infuriating. Almost 100% of the stalls they inspected were found to be shortchanging customers; a significant portion of the breakfast food weighed only half of what it should. We hope that the relevant departments will address this issue promptly.

    Shortchanging customers is an immoral act. Doing business and making money is legitimate, but one must do so honestly, through hard work, and in accordance with the law. Making money by cheating and defrauding customers is absolutely unacceptable.

    According to a report, Wuhan's breakfast food was once famous nationwide for its variety, affordable prices, and rich flavors. However, recent spot checks conducted by the Wuhan Municipal Metrology Administration in the three towns of Wuhan revealed that nearly 100% of the breakfast food was shortchanged, with the weight often only half of what it should be.

    In Hankou, at the intersection of Baofeng Road, individual vendor Xiang Zongyou's pan-fried buns were found to weigh only half of the standard amount after being weighed by the inspectors. Xiang Zongyou admitted that he uses 12.5 kilograms of flour daily to make pan-fried buns. Based on this amount, he earns an extra 70 yuan and 12.5 kilograms of grain tickets daily by shortchanging customers. In the same area, individual vendor Jiang Shimin's steamed buns, Baofeng Comprehensive Service Company's steamed buns, and individual vendor Ji Dengguo's fried dough sticks all weighed only half of the standard amount. The inspectors conducted 40 such inspections in this area, and every single one was found to be shortchanging customers.

    The inspection results in Hanyang showed that 100% of the breakfast food was shortchanged.

    In Wuchang, along Zhongbei Road and in the Fruit Lake area, only one state-owned restaurant's breakfast food met the standard weight during the inspection, while all other state-owned, collective, and individual stalls were found to be shortchanging customers, with the degree of shortchanging similar to that in Hankou and Hanyang. Currently, in Wuhan, an 11-year-old girl feels full after eating 100 grams of breakfast food at home, but she needs to eat 250 grams on the street. According to statistics, more than 80% of Wuhan's residents eat breakfast on the street every day, and such a large number of consumers are suffering from shortchanging daily, which should be taken seriously.

### 度量衡管理所检查结果表明  武汉早点严重短斤少两

    度量衡管理所检查结果表明
    武汉早点严重短斤少两
    编者按：武汉市度量衡管理所提供的检查结果相当惊人，且令人愤慨。他们所查的摊点几乎百分之百短斤少两；相当一部分早点的分量竟少了一半。希望有关部门对这种情况能及早予以解决。
    做生意短斤少两，是不道德的行为。经商赚钱，天经地义，但要取之有道，靠自己的劳动，遵纪守法得到相应的报酬和利润。靠坑人骗人发不义之财是绝不能允许的。
    本报讯　武汉市的早点曾以花色品种多、价格便宜而闻名全国。但是，武汉市度量衡管理所最近分别在武汉三镇突击检查的结果表明：早点短斤少两面将近100％，短斤少两的程度都在50％左右。
    在汉口的宝丰路口，个体户向宗友做的锅贴，经检查人员一称，重量只有标准计量的一半。向宗友说，他每天只卖出12.5公斤面粉做的锅贴。就按这个量来算，他每天靠短斤少两就多赚70多元钱，多收12.5公斤粮票。还是在这一带：个体户姜拾民出售的包子只有规定分量的一半；宝丰综合服务公司中心店出售的烧饼只有规定分量的一半；个体户纪登国卖的油条也只有规定分量的一半。检查人员在这一带进行了40例这样检查，例例都短斤少两，无一例外。
    武汉市度量衡管理所在汉阳检查的结果，早点短斤少两面仍是100％。
    在武昌的中北路一带和水果湖，检查时只发现一家国营酒楼的早点完全够标准分量，其余的国营、集体餐馆和个体摊点都短斤少两，短斤少两的程度和汉口、汉阳是一样的。现在，在武汉市，一个11岁的女孩在家吃早点100克就饱了，在街上却要吃250克。据统计，武汉市每天有80％以上的市民在街上吃早点，如此之多的消费者每天在身受短斤少两之苦，应该引起重视。
