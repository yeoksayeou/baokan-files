Morning exercises, a prominent item on the daily schedule, had long seemed like a distant memory. Now, the once-quiet mornings on campus are bustling with activity again.

This is a song of youth. At six in the morning, when over 4,000 undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students rush to the sports field for a run, breaking the silence of dawn; when the square-shaped formation raises their arms in unison to the broadcasted commands, stepping into the morning light, and immersing themselves in the vibrant campus, one feels a surge of spirit, a burst of youthful energy and vitality.

Morning exercises also serve as a window.

In the past, one could often capture such scenes on campus: after lights out in the evening, some students would light candles to play cards, chess, or mahjong, lift weights, hum songs, or cheer loudly. The mornings, however, were unexpectedly quiet, with many students hurriedly eating bread with sleepy eyes on their way to class. Now, the sound of recitation can be heard again. Although many students find it initially uncomfortable, to the point of not sleeping well at night to avoid missing the exercises, it is nonetheless a good start.

Through this window of morning exercises, one can see a new spirit, a different campus life.

Starting something is hard, and maintaining it is even harder. How can morning exercises, which involve a broad scope and many people, be sustained? The Mechanical Engineering Department, from the beginning of the semester, strictly curbed three trends: mahjong, cheating, and heckling. Now, morning exercises have become an integral part of their efforts to improve academic discipline. On one hand, they explain the reasons to the students during mobilization, and on the other hand, they enforce strict discipline. Cadres are responsible for ensuring that students participate in the exercises, linking their attendance with rewards or penalties. As long as morning exercises become a conscious need for the students, and as long as various departments take this seriously and truly fulfill their responsibilities, the mornings on campus will forever be full of life.

    早晨，青春的旋律
    ——记长沙铁道学院学生的晨操
    何云波　刘贡求
    早操，这赫然印于作息表上的一项，曾仿佛成了人们久远的回忆。
    如今，沉寂了多年的校园的早晨，又沸腾起来了。
    这是一支青春的歌。早晨六点，当4000余名本、专科生、研究生跑步涌向运动场，打破黎明的沉寂；当方字型的队伍随着广播的领操口号，一齐举起了手臂，踏着晨曦，置身于这沸腾的校园时，人们感到了一种昂奋的精神，一种青春的活力与朝气。
    早操，也是一个窗口。
    在校园里，过去经常可以摄下这样的镜头：晚上熄灯了，点蜡烛玩牌的、下棋的、搓麻将的、练哑铃的、哼歌的、吆喝起哄的……早晨却是意外的寂静，不少人常常是睡眼惺忪地啃着馒头赶往教室。而今，又重新听到了琅琅的读书声。不少学生尽管感到一时不习惯，乃至为了不误操连晚上睡觉都不安稳，但毕竟是个很好的开端。
    透过早操这一窗口，看到了一种新的精神风貌，看到了校园生活的别一天地。
    万事开头难，坚持更难。涉及面广人多的早操怎样持之以恒呢？机工系一开学即狠刹三种风：麻将风、舞弊风、起哄风。如今早操成了他们整饬学风的一个有机组成部分。一方面在动员中跟学生讲清道理，一方面规定了严格的纪律。干部包干负责，对学生出操情况与评奖评优或批评处分结合起来。只要晨操晨练成了同学们的一种自觉的需要，只要各职能部门高度重视，真正负起责任来，校园的早晨将永远是这样充满生机。
