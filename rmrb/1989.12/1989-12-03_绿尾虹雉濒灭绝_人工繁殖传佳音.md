    The Green-Tailed Tragopan Faces Extinction, Artificial Breeding Brings Good News

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st. (Reporter Yan Zhen Guo) The reporter learned today from the Beijing Endangered Animal Breeding and Research Center that two Green-Tailed Tragopan chicks artificially bred and raised here have reached six months of age. This scientific achievement brings hope for saving this rare and endangered bird species.

    There are three species of Tragopan in the world: the Brown-Tailed Tragopan, the White-Tailed Tragopan, and the Green-Tailed Tragopan. Among them, the Green-Tailed Tragopan is only found in southeastern Qinghai, southern Gansu, and northern Sichuan in China. However, its population is now very small and it is on the brink of extinction. Its rarity is comparable to that of the Giant Panda. China began artificial breeding and raising of the Green-Tailed Tragopan in 1955, but previously, the longest a chick survived was only 28 days.

    绿尾虹雉濒灭绝  人工繁殖传佳音
    据新华社北京12月1日电  （记者阎振国）记者今天从北京濒危动物驯养繁殖中心获悉，这里由人工饲养繁殖两只绿尾虹雉雏鸟已愈六月龄。这一科研成果的取得，为拯救这一濒临灭绝的稀世珍禽带来希望。
    虹雉在世界上共有棕尾虹雉、白尾虹雉和绿尾虹雉三种。其中的绿尾虹雉仅在我国的青海东南部、甘肃南部以及四川北部有分布。但目前数量很少，濒临灭绝，其珍贵程度可同于大熊猫。我国从1955年开始进行绿尾虹雉的人工饲养繁殖工作，但此前雏鸟成活最长的仅有28日龄。
