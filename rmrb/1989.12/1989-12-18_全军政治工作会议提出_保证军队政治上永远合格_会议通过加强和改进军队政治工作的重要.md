Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th. (Reporters Liu Hui Nian, Luo Yu Wen) The full military political work conference, which focused on studying how to strengthen and improve military political work in the new situation, concluded today. The conference produced the important document "Several Issues on Strengthening and Improving Military Political Work in the New Situation." The conference called on the entire military, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to further strengthen and improve political work, ensure the Party's absolute leadership over the military, and ensure that the military remains politically sound.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Central Military Commission paid great attention to this conference. Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Yang Shangkun, President and First Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, emphasized the importance of this conference and hoped that the attendees would seriously discuss and revise the important document "Several Issues on Strengthening and Improving Military Political Work in the New Situation." Liu Huaqing, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered a speech at the conference, highly praising its significance. He said that the theme of this conference relates to the fundamental direction of military construction and is a conference to solve comprehensive issues, which will have a profound and important impact on the construction of our army. He stressed that the fundamental task of military political work is to ensure that our army remains politically sound, primarily by ensuring that our army always adheres to its nature and the Party's absolute leadership over the military, always follows the Party's commands, and seriously implements the Party's lines, principles, and policies, maintaining consistency with the Party Central Committee, and completing all tasks assigned by the Party to the military.

The conference was presided over by Yang Baibing, Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department. He spoke at the beginning and conclusion of the conference, elaborating on the tasks, guiding ideology, principles, and work methods of military political work in the new situation. He required all levels of Party committees and political organs in the military to seriously implement the spirit of the conference and further do a good job in the political work of the troops. He emphasized that the current and future political work should be centered around ensuring that the military remains politically sound, and should be persistently and solidly carried out.

The attendees focused their efforts, carefully read the document, closely linked it with the actual work of the troops, actively expressed their opinions, made suggestions, and collectively discussed and revised the "Several Issues on Strengthening and Improving Military Political Work in the New Situation."

This document consists of 10 issues:
(1) Clearly understand the new situation facing military construction and regard ensuring political soundness as a fundamental task;
(2) Insist on the lifeline position of political work and fully play the political advantages of our army;
(3) Insist on the Party's absolute leadership over the military and strengthen the construction of Party organizations at all levels;
(4) Focus on education to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, always maintaining a firm and correct political direction in the troops;
(5) Insist on cultivating revolutionary soldiers according to the "four-haves" goal and improve the ideological and moral quality of cadres and soldiers;
(6) Strictly select cadres according to the principle of both virtue and ability, ensuring that the guns are in the hands of politically reliable people;
(7) Highly value the struggle against corruption, consolidating the socialist ideological and cultural front in the troops;
(8) Insist on the principles of unity between officers and soldiers and between the military and the people, maintaining and developing good internal and external relations;
(9) Implement the ideology of dialectical materialism, enhancing the effectiveness of ideological and political work;
(10) Political work should be improved on the premise of strengthening, and innovated on the basis of inheritance.

The attendees believed that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping took charge of the military commission, our military's political work has made new and significant developments. The entire military has seriously implemented the Party's lines, principles, and policies, maintaining high consistency with the Party Central Committee. Political work has maintained the correct direction, progressed by eliminating interference, and developed through continuous exploration, achieving significant strengthening and improvement.

The conference, based on the important instructions from the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening political construction in the new situation, clearly proposed the issue of ensuring that our military remains politically sound and conducted in-depth and serious discussions around this major theme. The attendees believed that the "Several Issues on Strengthening and Improving Military Political Work in the New Situation" regards strengthening political construction and ensuring that the military remains politically sound as the fundamental task of military political work in the current and future periods. It fully reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions on maintaining the nature of the people's army and the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, summarizes the new experiences of political work in recent years, especially in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, clarifies the confused ideological and theoretical issues caused by bourgeois liberalization, and further clarifies the principles and policies of political work, which are highly targeted. This is another important document following the 1986 Central Military Commission's "Decision on Military Political Work in the New Era," which will undoubtedly play an important guiding role in promoting the construction of our army.

The conference pointed out that the new international and domestic situations and the complex political climate have raised higher requirements for the political construction of our army. In the new situation, there are many aspects to the political work of the troops, but the first and foremost is to solve the problem of how to ensure that the military remains politically sound, that is, to pass the "three tests" of reform and opening up, a relatively peaceful environment, and the struggle against "peaceful evolution." Our army is a strong pillar of people's democratic dictatorship and must perform its functions well. Carrying out military training, implementing war preparedness, and improving logistical support capabilities are undoubtedly very important. However, enhancing the political firmness of cadres and soldiers and ensuring that the guns are truly in the hands of politically reliable people is a top priority that must be constantly attended to.

The conference emphasized that strengthening the Party's absolute leadership over the military is a fundamental principle of military construction and a reliable guarantee for the military to remain politically sound. The Communist Party of China is the ruling party and the core leader of the socialist cause, representing the fundamental interests of the state and the people. The Party's leadership over the military is consistent with the state's leadership over the military, and the two should not be opposed. The state's leadership over the military should not be used to weaken and dilute the Party's leadership over the military. Our army serves the Party's program and line, and the nature of our Party and the class nature of our army determine that our army must accept the Party's absolute leadership. On this point, there must be no wavering.

The conference pointed out that enhancing the awareness and firmness of upholding the four cardinal principles is an important ideological and political foundation for ensuring that our army remains politically sound. Only by strengthening the education to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, and by correcting the political direction, can other problems have a solid ideological foundation. The education to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization should be the main course of current political education in the troops and should be integrated into other education. It is necessary to strengthen the study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

The conference pointed out that cultivating cadres and soldiers into revolutionary soldiers with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, and improving the overall ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural quality of the troops, is an important task of ideological and political work. In the new situation of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy, strengthening ideological and moral construction is of even greater importance for maintaining the political soundness of the troops. The army should maintain high standards in ideological and moral construction. It is necessary to vigorously advocate and carry forward communist ideological and moral values, vigorously promote and cultivate the spirit of selfless dedication, and deeply carry out the campaign to learn from Comrade Lei Feng.

The conference pointed out that according to the Party's basic line and the overall requirement of building a modernized and regularized revolutionary army, it is necessary to strengthen and improve political work in the new situation. It is necessary to prevent and overcome the two tendencies of neglecting revolutionary traditions and mechanically copying some "leftist" practices from the past. It is necessary to pay attention to the two-point theory and avoid one-sidedness.

The full military political work conference began on December 11th.

Attendees of this conference included Guo Linxiang, Zhou Keyu, Zhou Wenyuan, and Yu Yongbo, responsible comrades from the General Political Department and the Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission, political department directors from all major military units, and responsible comrades from relevant departments.

    全军政治工作会议提出
    保证军队政治上永远合格
    会议通过加强和改进军队政治工作的重要文件
    新华社北京12月17日电  （记者刘回年、罗玉文）以集中研究新形势下如何加强和改进军队政治工作为中心内容的全军政治工作会议今天结束。会议产生了《关于新形势下加强和改进军队政治工作的若干问题》的重要文件。会议号召全军在以江泽民同志为核心的党中央和中央军委的领导下，进一步加强和改进政治工作，保证党对军队的绝对领导，保证军队在政治上永远合格。
    中共中央和中央军委十分关心这次会议。中共中央总书记、中央军委主席江泽民，国家主席、中央军委第一副主席杨尚昆，强调这次会议很重要，希望与会同志认真讨论和修改好《关于新形势下加强和改进军队政治工作的若干问题》这一重要文件。中央军委副主席刘华清到会讲话，高度评价这次会议。他说，这次会议的主题关系到军队建设的根本方向，是个解决全局性问题的会议，将在我军建设上产生深远的重要影响。他强调，军队政治工作的根本任务，就是要保证我军在政治上永远合格，最主要的就是要保证我军始终不渝地坚持自己的性质，保证党对军队的绝对领导，任何时候都听党的指挥，认真贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，同党中央保持一致，完成党赋予军队的一切任务。
    会议由中央军委秘书长、总政治部主任杨白冰主持。他在会议开始和结束时分别讲了话。他详细阐述了新形势下军队政治工作的任务、指导思想、方针原则和工作方法。他要求全军各级党委和政治机关要认真贯彻会议精神，进一步做好部队的政治工作。他强调，当前和今后的政治工作，就是要紧紧围绕保证军队政治上永远合格这个中心来展开，要持久地、扎扎实实地抓下去。
    与会同志集中精力，仔细阅读文件，紧密联系部队工作实际，积极发表意见，提建议，集思广益，精心讨论和修改了《关于新形势下加强和改进军队政治工作的若干问题》。
    这个文件共分10个问题：（一）清醒认识军队建设面临的新形势，把保证政治上永远合格作为一项根本任务；（二）必须坚持政治工作的生命线地位，充分发挥我军的政治优势；（三）坚持党对军队的绝对领导，大力加强各级党组织建设；（四）突出抓好坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，始终保持部队坚定正确的政治方向；（五）坚持按“四有”目标培养革命军人，提高干部战士的思想道德素质；（六）严格按照德才兼备原则选拔干部，保证枪杆子掌握在政治上可靠的人手里；（七）高度重视反腐蚀斗争，巩固部队的社会主义思想文化阵地；（八）坚持官兵一致、军民一致的原则，保持和发展良好的内外关系；（九）贯彻唯物辩证法思想，增强思想政治工作的有效性；（十）政治工作要在加强的前提下改进，在继承的基础上创新。
    与会同志认为，党的十一届三中全会以来，特别是邓小平同志主持军委工作以来，我军政治工作有了新的重大发展。全军认真贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，政治上同党中央保持高度一致。政治工作坚持了正确方向，在排除干扰中前进，在不断探索中发展，得到了有力的加强和改进。
    会议根据党中央和中央军委关于军队在新形势下要加强政治建设的重要指示，明确提出了保证我军在政治上永远合格的问题，并紧紧围绕这个重大主题，进行了深入认真讨论。与会同志认为，《关于新形势下加强和改进军队政治工作的若干问题》把加强政治建设，保证军队在政治上永远合格，作为当前和今后一个时期军队政治工作的根本任务，充分体现了邓小平同志关于保持人民军队性质的指示和军委扩大会议精神，总结了近几年，特别是平息北京反革命暴乱斗争政治工作新的经验，澄清了被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的一些思想理论是非，进一步明确了政治工作的方针原则，针对性很强。这是继1986年中央军委《关于新时期军队政治工作的决定》之后的又一重要文件，对推动我军建设定会发挥重要指导作用。
    会议指出，国际国内新的情况和复杂的政治气候，对我军的政治建设提出了更高的要求。在新的形势下，部队政治工作头绪很多，但第一位的还是要解决好如何保证军队在政治上永远合格的问题，也就是要经得住改革开放、相对和平的环境和反“和平演变”斗争这“三个考验”。我们的军队是人民民主专政的坚强柱石，要履行好自己的职能，搞好军事训练、落实战备工作、提高后勤保障能力，无疑是十分重要的。但增强干部战士政治上的坚定性，保证枪杆子真正掌握在政治上可靠的人手里，是时刻要注意的头等大事。
    会议强调，加强党对军队的绝对领导，是我军建设的一个根本原则，是军队在政治上永远合格的可靠保证。中国共产党是执政党，是社会主义事业的领导核心，代表了国家和人民的根本利益。党领导军队与国家领导军队是一致的，决不能把两者对立起来，决不能用强调国家领导军队来淡化和削弱党对军队的领导。我军是为实现党的纲领、路线服务的，我们党的性质和军队的阶级属性，都决定了我军必须接受党的绝对领导。对这一点，不能有丝毫的动摇。
    会议指出，提高坚持四项基本原则的自觉性和坚定性，是保证我军在政治上永远合格的重要政治思想基础。只有抓好坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，把政治方向搞端正，解决其他问题才有坚实的思想基础。要把坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化作为当前部队政治教育的主课，贯穿到其他教育中去。必须加强马列主义、毛泽东思想基本理论的学习。
    会议指出，把干部战士培养成有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的革命军人，提高整个部队的思想道德素质和科学文化素质，是思想政治工作的重要任务。在改革开放、发展社会主义商品经济的新形势下，抓好思想道德建设，对保持部队政治上永远合格，具有更为重要的意义。军队在思想道德建设上应该坚持高标准。要大力提倡和发扬共产主义思想道德，大力倡导和培育无私奉献精神，要深入开展向雷锋同志学习的活动。
    会议指出，要根据党的基本路线和建设现代化、正规化革命军队的总要求，坚持一要加强，二要改进，做好新形势下的政治工作。要防止和克服忽视革命传统和照搬过去一些“左”的做法两种倾向。必须注意坚持两点论，力求避免片面性。
    全军政治工作会议是12月11日开始举行的。
    参加这次会议的有总政治部、军委纪委的负责同志郭林祥、周克玉、周文元、于永波，全军各大单位的政治部主任以及有关方面的负责同志。
