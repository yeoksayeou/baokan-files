Shanghai has taken the lead in issuing "yellow" regulations, with the "Shanghai Municipal Regulations on the Prohibition of Harmful Publications" coming into effect today. This is the first set of regulations specifically aimed at prohibiting harmful publications issued by a local government in the country.

This set of "Regulations" was formulated based on the experiences and lessons learned from the rectification of the cultural market. It clearly defines the standards for identifying harmful publications, stating that harmful publications include those that are reactionary, obscene, pornographic, glorify violence and murder, and promote feudal superstitions. Each type of harmful publication is clearly and scientifically defined. The boundaries of what does not constitute a harmful publication are also clearly and specifically defined. Additionally, the "Regulations" provide specific provisions for the penalties applicable to the production, sale (transportation), rental, and dissemination of harmful publications.

The issuance of these "Regulations" provides a legal basis for the campaign against "yellow" publications and the handling of harmful publications, further bringing them under the rule of law, and making the handling of harmful publications a regular practice.

    上海颁布“扫黄”法规
    查禁有害出版物暂行规定开始实施
    本报上海12月5日电　上海市率先颁布“扫黄”法规，今天起实施《上海市查禁有害出版物暂行规定》。这是全国第一个由地方政府制定的专门查禁有害出版物的规章。
    此项《规定》是在总结了整顿文化市场的经验教训基础上制定出来的。它明确规定了有害出版物的鉴定标准，指出有害出版物包括反动、淫秽、色情、渲染凶杀暴力、宣扬封建迷信的出版物，而且对有害出版物中的每一种出版物都作了明确的、科学的界定。对不属有害出版物的界限也作了明确具体的规定。同时，《规定》还对制作、贩卖（运）、出租、传播有害出版物者如何处罚作了具体规定。
    这一《规定》的颁布，使“扫黄”、查处有害出版物有法可依，进一步纳入法制轨道，并使查处有害出版物经常化。
