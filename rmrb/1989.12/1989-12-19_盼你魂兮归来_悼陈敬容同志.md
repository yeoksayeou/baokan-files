Title: Longing for Your Spirit to Return – In Memory of Comrade Chen Jingrong

Returning home late at night, I received a letter with an unusual envelope. It was sent from Beijing Sandian North Street No. 2, the Chinese Writers Association, with a line of striking black type: "Chen Jingrong Comrade's Funeral Office." It kept me pinned in the rain for a long time.

Everything is too late!

Two days ago, a wisp of smoke had already carried you high into the unknown. Night after night, the north wind blows, bringing rain, have you returned? Did you bring an umbrella?

I hear the faint sound of bells. You brought in the positive spiritual wealth from abroad.

Esmeralda weeps, the kind-hearted Quasimodo pulls the ropes of Notre Dame Cathedral with a heavy heart, roaring, but I can't hear what he is shouting, only large tears, soaking the black marble. He is seeing you off, the bells follow you, very far away.

I hear faint calls.

It is he, Julius Fučík, holding the last bullet in his hand, standing tall, with a fallen empire and broken tank tracks at his feet. He is calling you, cherishing a report written under the gallows, printed in square Chinese characters, every page like the red leaves of West Mountain.

Under the lamp, Baudelaire and Rilke's pens become heavy, countless images surge to the tip of the pen, but none can describe you.

Only Hans Christian Andersen curls up in the cold wind of the North.

The heart warms the innocent soul.

You are a green leaf of youth. The greenest and brightest leaf in the "Nine Leaves," how could it wither and fall?

"Time grows old."

You died of pneumonia, aged seventy-two.

Was it because it got cold, and you forgot to wear more clothes?

Was it because you smoked too much, and you lacked self-control?

Maybe so. In recent years, you returned to your hometown several times. Your alcohol tolerance was astonishing, drinking cup after cup, you said, "I am not afraid!" Your smoking habit was astonishing, smoking one after another, you said, "I am not afraid!" Alcohol and cigarettes are afraid of you?

I remember seven years ago in the summer at Lüshunkou, standing by the seaside battery ruins, I was chatting with a poet friend, "In a few more years, when I am old, I will not write poetry." You suddenly jumped in from the side (I always felt you walked not by walking but by jumping), shaking the cigarette between your fingers, saying, "You cannot grow old! I will not grow old! Since I will not grow old, how can I not write poetry?"

Time grows old.

Chen Jingrong does not grow old.

But if the heavens have feelings?

From now on, I often think of you not growing old, and I also feel that I will not grow old. If I do not grow old, I must write poetry. Three years ago, in Jianyang's Sancha Lake, during a stormy return journey, I suddenly thought of your poem "The world is not a landscape," so I wrote a poem and sent it to you. In the poem, there are these lines:

No canopy, no umbrella, no straw hat,
Quick arrows pierce the shivering body.
Journey's end,
Fate is the carrier of life...

Come closer, come even closer...
Only with waves can the wind flag be seen.
There is a true cost,
Love has its destination.
Just do not let the heart sail fall,
Just do not let the wings be pressed down...

After the poem was published, I have been waiting for your "reply." Standing by the banks of the Dadu River, night after night, I seem to see the light from the 16th floor of Beijing Xuanwu Gate West Street.

What I received was a wisp of faint smoke.

What I received was a drizzle of sorrow.

The hometown people are sad. Wiping away tears and looking up, the red lanterns on the boats have disappeared from the Minjiang River, and the boatmen's calls have fallen silent in the Three Gorges. But there is the windpipe playing, but there is the green bird carrying, you should return, when will you return? Yes, seventy-two years is a bumpy road; yes, seventy-two years is a heavy burden. But can the wind not send you a journey, can the water not send you a journey? Return, return to live in the old Xiaoding in Leshan City. Here, you can overlook the golden summit of Mount Emei from afar, and look down to see the surging clear waters of the three rivers. Morning and evening, the elders, brothers, and sisters of the hometown will be your companions.

Old Xiaoding, green all year round.

You are a leaf, green all year round.

    盼你魂兮归来——悼陈敬容同志
    周纲
    夜归，收到一封信封奇特的信。信寄自北京沙滩北街二号中国作家协会，一行触目惊心的黑体字：陈敬容同志治丧办公室，把我久久地钉在雨中。
    一切都来不及了！
    两天前，一缕烟尘已把你高高地送入冥冥之中。夜夜有北风吹来，夹着雨，你回来了吗，你带伞没有？
    我听见隐隐的钟声，你从外国引进了积极的精神财富。
    爱斯梅拉达含着眼泪，善良的伽西莫多沉痛地拉着巴黎圣母院的钟绳，他哇哇地呐喊着，听不清他叫喊些什么，只有大颗大颗的泪，浸透了黑色的大理石。他是在为你送行，钟声追随你去，很遥远。
    我听见隐隐的呼唤。
    是他，尤里乌斯·伏契克，手里托着最后一颗子弹，他昂首站着，脚下倒着一个曾经不可一世的帝国和断了链条的坦克的履带。他在呼唤你，他珍藏着一部用方块汉字印刷的绞刑架下的报告，每一页都像西山的红叶。
    灯下，波德莱尔和里尔克的笔都变得滞重，多少意象涌向笔尖，但，都不能喻你。
    只有安徒生蜷缩在北欧的冷风里。
    心，温暖着天真纯洁的灵魂。
    你是一片青春的绿叶。“九叶”中绿得最丰盈最鲜亮的一片，怎么会枯黄会飘坠呢！
    “老去的是时间”。
    你死于肺炎，终年七十二岁。
    是天冷了，你忘了多加几件衣裳？
    是烟抽得太多了，你缺少节制？
    也许是的。近年你几次返回故乡，你的酒量惊人，一杯接一杯地干，你说：“我不怕！”你的烟瘾惊人，一支接一支地抽，你说：“我不怕！”酒和烟都怕你？
    记得七年前的夏天在旅顺口，站在面向大海的炮台故垒之旁，我正和诗友闲聊，“再过几年，老了，我就不写诗了。”你忽然从斜刺里跳过来（我始终感觉你走路不是走而是跳），晃动着手指间的香烟说：“不能老！我就不老！既然不老怎么可以不写诗呢！”
    老去的是时间。
    不老的是陈敬容。
    然而，天若有情呢？
    自此，我常想着你不老，我也觉得我不会老，不老就要写诗。三年前去简阳三岔湖，风雨归舟突然想起你的诗“人世并非风景”，于是写了一首诗兼寄给你。诗中，有这样的句子：
    没有篷舱没有伞没有斗笠，
    快活的冷箭射向瑟缩的胴体。
    天涯归程，
    命运是人生载体……
    靠紧些吧再靠紧些……
    有浪才见风旗。
    真有真的代价，
    爱有爱的归宿。
    只是不要把心帆落下，
    只是不要把翅膀压低……
    诗发表以后，我一直等待着你的“回信”。站在大渡河畔，夜夜，我都仿佛看见北京宣武门西大街十六楼透出的灯光。
    等来的是一缕淡淡的烟。
    等来的是一阵愁愁的雨。
    故乡人惆怅。拭泪翘首，岷江上绝迹了红灯高挑的航船，三峡里喑哑了梢公的号子。但有风笛吹送，但有青鸟负驮，你该回来，你几时回来呢？是的，七十二年路很坎坷；是的，七十二年背负很重。但是，风不能送你一程水不能送你一程吗？回来，回来住在乐山城中的老霄顶。在这里，远眺可以看见峨眉山的金顶，低头可以俯瞰三江的滔滔清流。暮暮朝朝，家乡的父老兄弟姐妹朝夕与你为伴。
    老霄顶，一年四季葱葱笼笼。
    你是叶，一年四季绿在其中。
    注：陈敬容同志是我国著名的“九叶”诗人之一。译著有《巴黎圣母院》、《绞刑架下的报告》、《安徒生童话》等。《老去的是时间》是她的获奖诗集。近年，又翻译介绍了波德莱尔和里尔克的诗。
