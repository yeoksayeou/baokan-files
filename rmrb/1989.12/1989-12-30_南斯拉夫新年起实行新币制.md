Yugoslavia to Implement New Currency System Starting Next Year

According to the manager of the National Bank of Yugoslavia's treasury, starting from the first working day of next year, January 3rd, Yugoslavia will officially begin currency reform, replacing the current circulating currency with a new, convertible currency.

The new currency, one new dinar, will be equivalent to one hundred para, and its value will be equivalent to ten thousand old dinars. Seven new dinars can be exchanged for one West German mark, and twelve new dinars can be exchanged for one U.S. dollar. Residents and enterprises can freely purchase foreign exchange at banks. Currently, Yugoslavia's foreign exchange reserves have reached $7.73 billion, setting a new historical high. (Special Correspondent)
