The state of Kuwait is located on the northwestern shore of the Persian Gulf and the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, covering an area of 17,818 square kilometers. The population is 1.8 million, of which approximately 40% are Kuwaiti citizens and 60% are foreign residents. Among the residents, 95% are Muslims, with over 70% belonging to the Sunni sect. Arabic is the official language, and English is widely used. The capital is Kuwait City.

Kuwait has a small land area, mostly consisting of deserts and barren lands with rolling sand dunes. Only 1.1% of the land is suitable for cultivation. There are no perennial rivers or lakes, and the highest temperature can reach over 50 degrees Celsius. The annual rainfall is only 50 to 100 millimeters, making fresh water severely scarce.

Before the oil era, Kuwaitis relied on fishing, pearl diving, and livestock for their livelihood. With the development of oil, the traditional economic activities of livestock farming, fishing, and agriculture have become insignificant in the national economy. The emerging oil industry has developed rapidly, making Kuwait one of the world's major oil-producing and exporting countries. Now, Kuwait's oil companies are focusing on accelerating the development of "downstream" businesses, including oil transportation, refining, and product sales.

Kuwait has abundant oil reserves, with proven reserves of 94.5 billion barrels. At the current production rate of 1.35 million barrels per day, it can be extracted for another 200 years. The rich oil resources have made Kuwait one of the world's wealthiest nations. To benefit future generations, the Kuwaiti government established the "Future Generations Fund" for overseas investments. In 1987, Kuwait's overseas investment income was $6.3 billion, exceeding the income from the oil industry.

Kuwait faces a significant water supply problem. Since the 1950s, the Kuwaiti government has been building seawater desalination plants. Now, Kuwait has established the world's largest seawater desalination facilities, fully meeting the water needs of residents and industries. To store water, Kuwait has built numerous aesthetically pleasing water towers and tanks. Almost every house has several square, oval, or spherical water tanks on the roof or terrace. The most impressive are the three large towers by the sea, forming a group. The tallest one is 187 meters high.

Kuwait is one of the cradles of ancient Arab civilization. In the early 18th century, the Sabah family, driven by drought from the Arabian Peninsula, moved to Kuwait. In 1756, they established the Kuwaiti Sheikhdom. In 1871, Kuwait became a county under the Ottoman Empire's Basra Province. In 1899, Kuwait signed an agreement with Britain, making Britain the protectorate of Kuwait. In 1939, it became a British "protectorate." On June 19, 1961, Kuwait declared independence. China and Kuwait established formal diplomatic relations on March 1971. Since then, leaders from both countries have visited each other multiple times, and political, economic, trade, and cultural friendly cooperation relations have developed comprehensively.

    石油王国科威特
    科威特国位于海湾西北岸、阿拉伯半岛东北部，面积17818平方公里。人口180万，其中科威特籍人约占40％，外国侨民占60％。居民中95％信奉伊斯兰教，其中70％以上属逊尼派。阿拉伯语为官方语言，通用英语。首都科威特城。
    科威特国土面积小，多为荒漠旷野，沙丘起伏，适宜耕作的土地仅占1.1％。没有常年有水的河流和湖泊，气温最高达50多摄氏度，全年降雨量仅50至100毫米，淡水严重缺乏。
    科威特人在进入石油时代之前，依靠捕鱼、采集珍珠、畜牧为生。随着石油的开发，先辈们赖以生存的经济活动方式改变了。先前的畜牧业、捕鱼业、农业在国民经济中已无足轻重，新兴的石油工业得到迅速发展，成为世界主要的石油生产和输出国之一，现在，科威特的石油公司已着眼于加快发展“下游”业务，即原油输送、炼制及产品销售。
    科威特石油蕴藏量丰富，现已探明的储量为945亿桶，按目前日产135万桶计算，可够开采200年。得天独厚的石油资源使科威特成了世界上第一流的富裕国家。为了给子孙后代造福，科政府设立了“子孙基金”，用于海外投资。1987年，科威特的海外投资收入为63亿美元，超过了石油业的收入。
    科威特的饮水问题十分突出。从50年代起，科政府就着手建造海水淡化厂。现在已建立了世界最大的海水淡化设施，居民和工业用水完全自给。为贮存水，科威特兴建了许许多多造型美观的贮水塔和贮水箱。几乎每座房屋的屋顶或平台上都有几个方形、椭圆形或球形的贮水箱。其中最为壮观的是座落在海边的大塔，共3个，形成一组。最大的一座高187米。
    科威特是阿拉伯古代文明的摇篮之一。18世纪初叶，住在阿拉伯半岛的萨巴赫家族为干旱所迫来到科威特，1756年建立了科威特酋长国。1871年科威特成为奥斯曼帝国巴士拉省的一个县。1899年，同英国签订了一协定，英国成为科威特的宗主国。1939年沦为英国“保护国”。1961年6月19日宣布独立。中国与科威特于1971年3月正式建立外交关系。建交后，两国领导人多次互访，在政治、经济、贸易、文化友好合作关系全面发展。·伟源·
