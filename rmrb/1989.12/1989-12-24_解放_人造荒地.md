Title: Liberating "Artificial Wasteland"

Around many towns and cities, there are patches of land enclosed by walls, left idle year after year, overgrown with weeds. Many units have very few buildings but very long walls, leaving a lot of land unused and wasted. This is what people commonly refer to as "artificial wasteland."

Seeing this phenomenon, everyone feels deeply saddened. China's potential land crisis is extremely severe, yet many land-using units do not cherish land and do not consider the benefits of land use. They either seize land early and use it late, or seize a lot and use a little, or seize and do not use at all. The reasons behind this are varied: some are due to "confusion," while others are the result of "cleverness." By "confusion," we mean that some comrades ignore the national land situation, are eager to expand their operations and show off, thinking that the bigger the enterprise, the more impressive it is. They blindly engage in basic construction, resulting in land being seized and then left idle because funds and materials are not secured, or because design and construction do not align, or because municipal support is incomplete, and projects are delayed. By "cleverness," we mean that some comrades also have a sense of urgency, deeply understanding the value of land resources. However, their concern is not for the state but for themselves, fearing that future land seizures will be difficult and affect their unit's development. They think it's better to act preemptively. Unfortunately, this approach greatly harms agricultural and national interests.

I have two typical cases at hand. The Dengzhou City Summer Collective Township government in Henan Province wrote to report that 150 mu of arable land has been illegally seized by the county's relevant departments since 1969 to be used as an agricultural airfield. Except for the first four years when it was used four times for a total of about two months, the land has been idle ever since. Although local farmers have repeatedly requested the reasonable use of this 150 mu of arable land, the issue remains unresolved. Another piece of information reveals that a few years ago, four schools in Qingdao City needed 1411 mu of land for construction. The business management department, citing the urgency of the project, illegally preemptively occupied the arable land of Zhonghan Village and Dabiao Island Village in Laoshan County. Later, due to the lack of funds and other issues, the project could not proceed, and the occupied land became barren. Local farmers' production and living conditions could not be resolved, forcing them to file complaints.

I believe that to eliminate the phenomenon of "artificial wasteland," we must strictly enforce land approval procedures and plug institutional loopholes to prevent "land rats" from finding any gaps. At the same time, we must act according to the law and investigate land that has been enclosed for a long time but not used. We must exercise the power granted by the land law: if state-owned land is used without the approval of the original approving authority for two consecutive years, the management department can report to the county-level or higher people's government for approval to reclaim the land use rights. After reclaiming the land use rights, if it can be returned to agriculture, it should be returned to agriculture. If it cannot be returned to agriculture, it can be allocated according to the planning layout to units that urgently need construction land. In short, we must completely liberate "artificial wasteland" from the walls and fully utilize their social benefits.

### 解放“人造荒地”

    解放“人造荒地”
    江苏省淮阴市　殷振尧
    在许多城镇的周围，有一些用围墙圈起来的土地，整年整月地空在那里，长满了杂草，还有不少单位，建筑物并不多，围墙却拉得很长，以致许多地闲而不用，常年荒废。这，就是人们常说的“人造荒地”。
    看到这种现象，大家十分痛心。我国潜在的土地危机异常严峻，可时下不少用地单位却非常不珍惜土地，不讲求土地的使用效益。他们或早征迟用，或多征少用，或征而不用。其中原委：有的是“糊涂”造成的，有的则是“精明”所致。所谓糊涂，是指一些同志无视土地国情，热衷于铺摊子、讲排场，认为家大业大气派大，盲目地搞基本建设，结果在征占土地后，或因资金、材料不落实，或因设计施工不衔接、市政配套不周全，工程上马迟迟，造成土地撂荒。所谓“精明”，说的是有些同志也有“忧患”意识，深深懂得土地资源的宝贵。不过，他们忧的并不是国家，而是自己，生怕今后征地困难而影响本单位的发展，不如搞点“提前量”，来他个先下手为强。殊不知这样做，却极大损害了农业乃至国家的利益。
    我手头就掌握两个典型材料。河南省邓州市夏集乡政府来信反映，他们有150亩耕地自1969年被县有关部门擅自征作农用飞机场以来，除了前4年使用了4次累计约两个月之外，其余时间一直撂荒，至今已有16个年头。虽然当地农民多次要求合理使用这150亩耕地，但一直未得到解决。另有资料披露：几年前，青岛市4所院校建校需用地1411亩，业务主管部门借口工程任务急，擅自先行圈占崂山县中韩村、大表岛村的耕地。后来因资金等不落实，工程无法上马，被圈占的耕地一片荒芜。当地农民的生产生活无法解决，被迫四出告状。
    我认为要杜绝“人造荒地”的现象，一定要严格土地审批手续，切实从制度上堵住漏洞，使“土拨鼠”无缝可钻。同时，要依法办事，清查长期圈而不用的土地。要行使土地法赋予的权力：征用国有土地，未经原批准机关同意，连续两年未使用的土地，管理部门报经县以上人民政府批准，可收回土地使用权。收回土地使用权后，能退耕的退耕，无法复耕的，可根据规划布局调剂给急需建设用地的单位使用。总之，要把“人造荒地”彻底从围墙中解放出来，充分发挥它们的社会效益。
