Title: Farmers Yearn for News Pictures

Edition: 5

Our local townships and villages all have street news display windows. This year, during the National Day celebrations, we went to the Xinhua Bookstore to purchase National Day picture exhibitions, but there were none available. As for the historically significant images related to the Party's Thirteenth Plenum and Fourteenth Plenum, they are completely unavailable in rural areas. We hope that the picture publishing departments will consider the needs of the 800 million farmers and send more orders to rural Xinhua Bookstores, ensuring timely delivery to meet the cultural needs of our farmer friends.

    农民渴望新闻图片
    我们这里乡、村都设有街头新闻橱窗。今年国庆节，我们又到新华书店购买国庆图片展览，也根本没有货。至于具有历史意义的党的十三届四中全会、五中全会有关图片，在农村里压根儿买不到一套。我们渴望图片出版部门，要想着八亿农民，多往农村新华书店发点订单，及时邮购，满足农民朋友的文化生活需求。
