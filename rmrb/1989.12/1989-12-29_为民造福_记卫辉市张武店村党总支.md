The industrial and agricultural output value and per capita net income of Zhangwudian Village in Weihui City, Henan Province, have increased significantly year by year since the reform and opening up. Last year, they reached 11.88 million yuan and 1,063 yuan respectively.

The village's economy is famous far and wide, but its "spiritual wealth" is even more praised by people.

When talking about the changes in material and spiritual civilization construction in this village, people always remember the work done by the village party branch over the years.

When the countryside started implementing the household contract responsibility system, the Zhangwudian Village Party Branch, based on the village's high level of mechanization and good water conditions, organized party members to discuss for 25 days and decided to implement family contract management for collectively owned land, adopting the "three-field system" (grain field, commercial grain field, flexible field). Agricultural machinery, water conservancy, and other basic facilities continued to be operated collectively, providing a series of services to farmers in a dual-management structure.

At the beginning, a few people did not understand and even said that Zhangwudian did not implement the central policy. However, the Party Branch, through in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, quickly gained the understanding and support of the majority of villagers.

From 1983 to 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the village increased by 5.3 times in six years, and the per capita net income increased by 2.5 times. The masses are running faster and happier on the socialist road.

Zhangwudian Village was once a famous poor place, but poverty did not defeat them.

Since the 1970s, they started in extremely difficult conditions and successively built a flour mill, oil press, prefabricated component factory, brick and tile factory, poultry farm, and feed processing factory. Last year, they also built a textile factory, with an annual output value of 10 million yuan and a profit of 1.9 million yuan.

The rapid development of Zhangwudian Village's economy made the cadres and masses more convinced of the correctness of the current national policies, and their enthusiasm for production also increased.

This year, the village has set up a graphite factory, food factory, and other enterprises. All labor in the village is arranged for employment, and more than 100 workers are recruited from other villages.

When building the flour mill, there were no bricks, so they made their own; there was no timber, so the cadres took the lead in bringing it in from outside; there was no equipment, so they repaired old things and made do with what they had. The village cadres ran around, worked hard, and overcame one difficulty after another, turning over the first page of Zhangwudian's entrepreneurial history.

During the expansion of the oil mill, funding was very difficult, so the cadres took the lead in bringing in money, and the masses borrowed from relatives and friends. The workers tightened their belts, and for three years, they received less wages.

The factory director and Shou Bin worked day and night in the factory. His mother was in the hospital, but he never took a day off. The oil mill was built and gradually equipped. Last year, the total output value of the oil mill reached 70 million yuan, and the net income was 4 million yuan.

While focusing on ideological and political work, the village party branch established and improved the production and living service system for villagers, solving their worries and difficulties.

The village agricultural machinery team implements the principle of high-standard service and reasonable low-standard charges, taking on all 11 tasks of plowing, harrowing, sowing, managing, harvesting, transporting, and threshing for the villagers, achieving mechanized production.

The village water and electricity service team manages all 50 wells in the village, reducing irrigation time by half compared to the past, saving 20% of water, and in a severe drought year, 4,000 mu of farmland can be irrigated in 7 days.

The village agricultural technology service team enthusiastically provides agricultural consultations, scientific and technological lectures, and field guidance for farmers, promoting various services such as excellent varieties and reasonable fertilization, and improving their scientific farming awareness. The village party organization enthusiastically serves the people and truly benefits the people. Farmers joyfully say: "The service team serves thoughtfully, and the collective power is great!"

The village party branch also invested 160,000 yuan in education and training, building high-standard school buildings. The village set up a kindergarten, primary school, and junior high school, solving the problem of children's enrollment.

After solving the problem of food and clothing, farmers demand a more fulfilling, colorful, and civilized life. The party branch established a science and technology culture center. This year, they also built a lit sports field and set up a canteen and a new public bathhouse.

These measures to serve the villagers' production and life have eliminated the villagers' worries, and the village cadres have won the trust and support of the people with their actions.

Last Spring Festival, the people sent the following couplet to the Party Branch: "The hearts of the Party and the people are connected," "The feelings of officials and the masses are intertwined," with the horizontal scroll reading: "Unity and Virtue."

    为民造福
    ——记卫辉市张武店村党总支
    王俊富　付世光　许光敏
    河南省卫辉市张武店村，改革开放使这里的工农业产值和人均纯收入逐年大幅度提高，去年分别达到1188万元和1063元。
    这个村的经济富有远近闻名，而其“精神富有”更为人们称道。
    说起这个村物质、精神文明建设的变化，人们总是忘不了村党总支这些年所做的工作。
    农村开始搞联产承包责任制时，张武店村党总支根据本村机械化水平较高，水利条件较好的实际，组织党员讨论了25天，确定集体所有的土地实行家庭承包经营，搞“三田制”（口粮田、商品粮田、机动田），农机、水利等基础设施仍由集体经营，为农户提供系列化服务的双层经营格局。
    开始，少数人想不通，甚至说张武店不执行中央政策。然而，党总支通过深入细致的思想政治工作，使这一决策很快得到了广大村民的理解和支持。
    1983年至1988年全村工农业总产值6年中增长了5.3倍，人均纯收入增加2.5倍，群众在社会主义道路上越奔越欢。
    张武店村原来是一个有名的穷地方，但贫穷没有压倒他们。
    从70年代开始，他们在极为艰难的条件下起步，先后建成了面粉厂、榨油厂、预制件厂、砖瓦厂、养鸡场、饲料加工厂。去年又建起纺织厂，当年产值100万元，实现利润19万元。
    张武店村经济迅速发展，使干部群众更加坚信国家现行政策的正确性，生产热情也越来越高涨。
    今年这个村又办起了石墨厂、食品厂等企业。全村劳力全部安排就业，并从外村招收工人100多人。
    建面粉厂时，没有砖，自己烧；没有木料，干部带头往外拿；没有设备，修旧利废，因陋就简。村干部四处奔波，艰苦奋斗，他们克服了一个又一个困难，翻开了张武店创业史上的第一页。
    油厂扩建过程中，资金相当困难，干部带头往外拿，群众投亲靠友借。职工勒紧腰带，三年少领工资。
    厂长和守斌昼夜泡在厂里，母亲住医院，也没请过一天假。油厂建成并逐步配套，去年油厂总产值达700万元，纯收入40万元。
  村党总支在抓思想政治工作的同时，建立健全了村民的生产、生活服务体系，为群众排忧解难。
    村农机队实行高标准服务，低标准合理收费的原则，将村民的耕、耙、播、管、收、运、脱等11项作业任务全部承包，实现了机械化生产。
    村水电服务队，统管全村50眼机井，浇地时间比过去减少一半，节水20％，大旱之年4000亩耕地7天就可以普浇一遍。
    村农技服务组热情为农户开展农业咨询，科学技术讲座，深入田间指导，推行优良品种和合理施肥等多项服务工作，提高他们的科学种田意识。村党组织热情为群众服务，实实在在地为群众造福。农民群众欣喜地说：“服务队服务周到，还是集体力量大啊！”
    村党总支还为教学育人投资16万元，建起了高标准校舍。村里办起了幼儿园、小学、初中班，解决了儿童入学难的问题。
    农民解决温饱之后，要求生活更加充实、更加丰富多彩、更加文明。党总支又兴办科技文化中心。今年又建了灯光球场，还办起了食堂，新建一座浴池。
    为村民生产、生活服务的这些措施，解除了村民的后顾之忧，村干部以自己的行动赢得了群众的信任和拥护。
    去年春节，群众给党总支送了这样一副对联，“党心民心心连心”，“官情群情情系情”，横批是：“同心同德”。
