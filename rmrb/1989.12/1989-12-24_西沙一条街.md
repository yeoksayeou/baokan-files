Reporters from Hainan Island's Sanya Airport took a helicopter to the Xisha Islands. In less than an hour, we arrived at Yongxing Island. What appeared before our eyes was a wide and long street, with buildings lined up on both sides. Locals told us, "This is the 'Xisha Wangfujing'."

This scene emerged after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Ten years ago, when the reporter first visited Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands, it was a patch of shrubbery. Now, a new street has appeared, paved with concrete, and there are neat flower beds in the middle of the street.

Walking along the street, we saw department stores, banks, post offices, and fisheries all neatly arranged. The street was bustling with people.

We entered the department store and, following the crowd, pushed our way to the counter. The goods were abundant and varied, including daily necessities and high-end products. Cao Xia, a female salesperson who has worked on the island for eight years, smiled and told us, "In the past, the store had only about 100 types of goods. Now there are over 500. Last year, the sales volume was only 700,000 yuan, but this year it has nearly doubled."

The post office was busy with customers sending money, mailing letters, and sending packages, keeping the staff busy. The post office staff told us that business is brisk every day. Although the Xisha Islands are small and transportation is inconvenient, all postal services are available. The island receives over a thousand pieces of mail from the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong and Macau every year. The postmaster, Huang Shengchun, said to us, "The Xisha post office has developed from the initial single service of receiving and sending letters to today's ten-plus services including domestic telegrams, international letters, receiving and sending packages, remittances, selling stamps, philately, and publishing newspapers and magazines. This year alone, the number of newspaper and magazine subscriptions has increased by over 4,000 compared to previous years. The islanders call us the 'Xisha Wild Geese'."

The busiest place on this street is the bank. The building of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank's Southwest Zhongsha Branch is open for business almost 24 hours a day, with people coming and going to deposit and withdraw money. According to the 28-year-old bank manager, Mai Nianhong, almost everyone on Yongxing Island has a savings book, and people come to deposit and withdraw money day and night. The bank's business volume in the first half of the year has increased by two to three times compared to last year. The Xisha Islands have not had loan services for over 30 years, but this year, 6 million yuan in loans were issued for the first time.

At night, the street is brightly lit. Island residents gather in groups of three or five, some shopping in stores, buying goods; others enter the music tea house, sipping cold drinks while enjoying enchanting music.

In the past, there was a saying in the Xisha Islands: "During the day, see faces; at night, see stars." Not only was it impossible to watch television on the island, but it was also difficult to watch movies. In the spring of 1983, the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the Provincial People's Government, and the Hainan Administrative Committee allocated special funds to build the first television relay station in the Xisha Islands. Upon hearing this news, the General Political Department immediately provided the Xisha Islands with 30 color televisions, which were quickly delivered to the Xisha Islands by the Navy's special aircraft and ships. Since then, the "sentinels at the end of the earth" have been able to watch Beijing's color television programs, and the cultural life of the military and civilians in the Xisha Islands has become more colorful.

The young deputy secretary of the Southwest Zhongsha Work Committee, Xu Tianren, led us on a tour of the street and said, "In the past, this was a white sandy beach. Ten years of reform and opening up have allowed the military and civilians of the Xisha Islands to build a street on Yongxing Island, erect dozens of tall buildings, and a modern small town has taken shape."

The sea breeze made one feel refreshed. Walking along the street on Yongxing Island, we deeply felt that even this small island at the end of the earth is surging with the momentum of reform and opening up.

    西沙一条街
    新华社记者　刘回年　黄彩虹
    记者从海南岛三亚机场乘坐直升机飞往西沙群岛。不到一个小时，便到了永兴岛。出现在眼前的是一条又宽又长的街道，两边楼房鳞次栉比。岛上的人告诉我们，这里是“西沙王府井”。
    这种景象是党的十一届三中全会后才出现的。10年前，记者第一次到西沙永兴岛采访时看到，那时这里还是一片灌木丛，如今这里却出现了一条崭新的街道，铺的是水泥路面，还建有整齐的街心花坛。
    漫步在大街上，只见百货商店、银行、邮局、水产站整齐排列，游人熙熙攘攘。
    我们走进百货商店，随着人流挤到柜台前一看，商品应有尽有，琳琅满目，既有日常生活用品，也有高档商品。在岛上干了8年的女营业员曹霞笑着告诉我们：“过去店里只有100来种商品，现在有500多种了；去年销售额只有70万元，今年就差不多翻了两番。”
    邮电大楼里顾客踊跃，汇款的，寄信的，邮包裹的，把营业员忙得不可开交。邮局的同志告诉我们，每天业务很忙。别看西沙岛小，交通不便，各种邮政业务却齐全。这里来自美国、英国、联邦德国、日本、马来西亚、新加坡、港澳的邮件一年就达上千件。邮电局长黄胜春对我们说：“西沙邮局从最初单一的收发信件业务发展到今天开办了国内电报、国际信函、收寄包裹和汇款、出售邮票、集邮以及发行报刊等十多项业务，今年仅收订各种报刊就比往年增加了4000多份。岛上人叫我们是‘西沙鸿雁’”。
    这条街上最忙的算是银行了。中国工商银行西南中沙办事处大楼几乎是24小时开门营业，存款取款的人络绎不绝。据28岁的银行主任麦年红介绍，永兴岛上几乎每个人都有存折，白天晚上都有人来存款取款，上半年的银行营业额比去年增加了二三倍。西沙有30多年没有开展贷款业务，今年第一次就发放了60多万元的贷款。
    入夜，街上灯火辉煌。岛上居民三五成群，有的逛商店，购货物；有的走进音乐茶座，一边喝着冷饮，一边欣赏迷人动听的乐曲。
    以前西沙流传着一句顺口溜：“白天脸看脸，晚上看星星。”岛上别说看不到电视，就连看电影也很困难。1983年春节，广东省委、省人民政府和海南行政区党委拨专款在西沙群岛建成了第一座电视转播台。总政治部得知这个消息后，为使西沙军民能尽快看到中央电视台节目，立即发给西沙群岛30台彩色电视机，由海军派专机和船只迅速送到西沙。从此，“天涯哨兵”看上了北京的彩色电视节目，西沙军民的业余文化生活更加丰富多采了。
    年轻的西南中沙工委副书记徐天仁一边带领我们在街上参观，一边对我们说：“过去，这里是一片白沙滩。十年改革开放，西沙军民建成了永兴岛一条街，盖起了几十幢大楼，一座现代化小城镇已初具规模。”
    海风阵阵，使人心旷神怡。漫步在永兴岛一条街上，我们深深感受到天涯小岛也激荡着改革开放的劲风。
