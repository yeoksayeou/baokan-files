The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly today discussed disarmament issues and passed all 59 related resolutions. Among them, the two resolutions on nuclear and conventional disarmament proposed by the Chinese delegation were unanimously adopted for the fourth consecutive time, drawing widespread attention.

China's nuclear disarmament proposal urges the Soviet Union and the United States, which possess the most significant nuclear arsenals, to further fulfill their special responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, take the lead in taking action to stop the arms race, and accelerate negotiations to reach an agreement on significantly reducing their nuclear arsenals as soon as possible.

China's conventional disarmament proposal urges countries that bear special responsibilities for reducing conventional arms, possess the largest military arsenals, and are members of the two major military blocs to continue to accelerate negotiations. The goal is to reach an agreement as soon as possible on establishing a low-level, stable, and reliable balance of conventional arms and troops under effective international supervision, especially in regions with the highest concentration of weapons and troops, particularly in Europe.

The Assembly also passed by an overwhelming majority resolutions on preventing an arms race in outer space, prohibiting chemical and biological weapons, the relationship between disarmament and development, the role of science and technology in promoting disarmament, and declaring the 1990s as the Third Decade of Disarmament.

    我国裁军提案获联大一致通过
    提案指出美苏负有特殊责任应率先裁军
    本报联合国12月15日电  记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天审议了裁军问题，通过了全部59项有关裁军的决议，其中，中国代表团提出的关于核裁军和常规裁军两项决议草案，连续第4次获得一致通过，引起普遍注意。
    中国提出的核裁军提案，敦促拥有最重要核武库的苏联和美国进一步履行它们对核裁军负有的特殊责任，率先采取行动以停止军备竞赛，并为早日达成大幅度削减其核武库的协议加紧进行谈判。
    中国提出的常规裁军提案，敦促对裁减常规军备负有特殊责任、拥有最庞大军事武库的国家以及两大军事集团的成员国继续加紧谈判，以早日对在它们各自地区、特别是世界上武器和军队最为集中的欧洲地区，就在有效国际监督下确立低水平、稳定可靠的常规军备和军队的平衡问题达成协议。
    大会还以压倒多数通过了防止外层空间军备竞赛、禁止化学武器和细菌（生物）武器、裁军与发展之间关系、科学和技术促进裁军和宣布1990年代为第三个裁军10年等决议。
