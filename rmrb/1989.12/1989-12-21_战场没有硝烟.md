Edition: 8

The towering oil fields of Daqing on the Songnen Plain are like the giant, swollen breasts of Mother Earth, gushing forth black milk—the red heroes' spirit, the green totem of the times!

It is on this fertile black soil, this battlefield without gunpowder for soldiers, that Xu Enlai, a colonel adorned with a golden "August 1" military badge and silver star, led 18 "farmer-soldiers." Over seven years, they built 14 highways totaling 140 kilometers, earning the financially strapped military hundreds of millions in taxes. They created a miracle of 100,000 yuan in tax revenue per person per year!

Soldiers Do Not Choose Battlefields

The vast Changbai Mountains are blanketed in snow.

In the cold winter nights of the Northeast countryside, young men enjoy the warmth of their brick beds, the aroma of roasted seeds, and burning dreams. Xu Enlai, who became a Communist Party member at 19, couldn't bear the loneliness of these long nights. He would skate and trudge through the snow to watch movies and plays. At that time, the silver screen and stage were all the same: eight billion people, eight plays. Even the "Errenzhuan" (a local folk art) performed heroic images. The common people said they were sick of it, but Xu Enlai found it exhilarating every time. He loved "The White-Haired Girl" the most, especially the line "Like a pine tree on the top of Mount Tai." He admired Guo Jianhua, the great hero, and the pistol on his back. Xu Enlai tightened his belt, bundled his boots, and vowed to join the army, to become a hero on the battlefield. The military, the green fields of life, the sound of gunfire—the most beautiful melody in the world. Finally, a muffled old truck pulled in the ambitious Xu Enlai to the barracks of the "Bearded Commander's" division, into a world where heroes grow.

There was no war in the north. Xu Enlai exchanged his rifle for a submachine gun, then for a pistol. After several winters and springs, he only saw his rank rise unexpectedly. However, the "Type 54" pistol he carried could only be used to make a few holes in the target paper, and these holes were no more numerous than his age. "Prepare for early, big, and nuclear war." At first, others taught him this, and later, he taught others the same. Xu Enlai still dreamed of being a hero, feeling he had the appearance of a hero—broad shoulders, a thick waist, thick eyebrows, big eyes, a booming voice, and a powerful arm. However, on a late afternoon in early spring, the division commander gave him a special task with a serious expression:

Lead a small team to earn 40,000 yuan for the army to repair dilapidated barracks.

Obeying orders is a soldier's duty.

That night, Xu Enlai dreamed of being a hero again.

True soldiers do not choose battlefields.

In the spring of 1983, after a harsh winter, a "farmer platoon" of the People's Liberation Army, led by Xu Enlai, shouldered their military shovels and picks, and marched towards Daqing through the melting snow.

This new and beautiful oil city looked at the soldiers with strange and puzzled eyes. There were hotels and restaurants here, but unfortunately, they were not built for the soldiers. Should they borrow a place? If they were here to fight, camp, or rescue, the local authorities would naturally arrange accommodations. But they were here to find work, and now everyone talks about economic accounting. Who would take care of these "job-seekers"? Some even said, "Soldiers eat the emperor's grain and don't train well. They don't do their duty and earn money!" More fashionable young men and women said, "Look at these soldiers, they're like old cannons..."

Suddenly, a light snow fell in early spring. The soldiers of the small team, huddled around a bonfire on the vast grassland, all hung their noble heads. They were homeless.

Chinese soldiers are the most enduring and resilient in history, capable of overcoming all difficulties and hardships. Xu Enlai and his comrades set up tents in the open air, built stoves, and began a special battle.

Win the first battle. Xu Enlai removed the insignia from his uniform, perhaps forced by circumstances into a tragic role that did not match his status. He needed to say things he couldn't say in uniform. He had to maintain the dignity of the "August 1" badge, even though here the dignity of soldiers was almost non-existent. His round face, the color of deep autumn sorghum, was filled with forced smiles. He rushed around, seeking labor projects, negotiating, signing contracts, making budgets, taking buses, tricycles, trucks, his mind filled with projects, benefits, time... "Clang!" That day, Xu Enlai's "Liberation" truck collided with a local "East Wind" truck! Xu Enlai's head was split open with a seven-centimeter wound, like a child's mouth, bleeding profusely, and he fainted on the spot. Sent to the hospital, the diagnosis was: concussion, right leg comminuted fracture. Bright red blood left a military emblem on the white bedsheet—concentration area, encirclement, pincer attack... Soft bandages bound a tough man. Awakening, he asked about the project, wanted the drawings, the barracks built in his heart...

That year, Xu Enlai and his team paid a heavy price in flesh and spirit, earning 140,000 yuan for the army. The newly built barracks, do you know why you are red?

From then on, Xu Enlai took up a profession that was extremely unsuited to his status. He entered a world that did not belong to them, nor did it seem to belong to this army.

"Iron Man Well" Beside "Write" Spirit

This is a spiritual holy land.

Xu Enlai, limping, came to the side of the "Iron Man Well."

In March 1960, the Iron Man drilling team here pulled and carried the 40-meter-high well frame and 60-ton drilling machine equipment by hand, ate steamed buns when hungry, and slept in old sheepskin coats when tired, fighting for five days and nights to finally drill the first "spirit well"... Looking at the simple shack where the Iron Man studied "Two Articles," looking at the cement pool where the Iron Man jumped into the cold winter to stir the mud with his body, Xu Enlai's blood surged to his head, his eyes welled up, and he found something precious.

One oil well, a brand new world.

The work began. Xu Enlai first led his "farmer platoon" to pick up bricks. A group of over twenty young men, in the midst of tall buildings, on the side of busy roads, in garbage dumps filled with wine bottles, soda cans, high-end cosmetics, and low-quality toilet paper, they mixed with the junk like Ji Gong. Inevitably, there were some complaints: "Old Teacher, we'd rather go back to the farm to till the land than do this degrading job." "Old Teacher, I'll go buy a truckload of new bricks for you." Some soldiers boasted. Xu Enlai smiled:

"Buying a truckload of bricks, buying a brick factory we can afford, do you think I want a few broken bricks? I want a spirit!"

A few days later, several star-shaped flower beds adorned public places.

From then on, Xu Enlai and his team picked up stones, bricks, wooden sticks, and iron pipes on the construction site, on the way home from work, and even when going out on business. In a year, they picked up enough broken stones to pave a 4,000-square-meter courtyard, and every year they saved hundreds of yuan by picking small wooden stakes for construction.

In one place, the construction team's materials were flooded by a big water. Someone waved their hand and gave up. Xu Enlai laughed, leading his small team into the water to fish out the materials bit by bit. Everyone was frozen, their lips blue, their bodies shaking, but after a few days, they fished out 500 tons of stones and sand worth 100,000 yuan from the water.

The small team's truck carried lime and cement back, and several brooms swept the "battlefield." Over the years, 50 tons of lime and 150 cubic meters of sand and stones were piled up like a small mountain.

"Spirit, I want a spirit!"

Two bamboo kettles tied with iron wire, a heavy teapot with a set of coarse earthenware bowls. These were Xu Enlai's utensils for entertaining guests.

"Our old teacher is too stingy, even regulating how long a candle can burn, this TV was bought with money from picking up trash." Some soldiers whispered, "Yes, eating potatoes every day, we're not growing. Now there are all kinds of drinks, and on the construction site, we still have to carry a canteen..."

Xu Enlai, smiling like an old woman, came to their side: "In terms of the value we create, we can live in hotels and eat in restaurants every day, but we can't lose a spirit!"

Again, spirit. Yes, an era of spiritual omnipotence has ended, but can we let an era of spiritual emptiness descend?

In early summer this year, Xu Enlai's team undertook a road construction project that required nearly a hundred culverts, each weighing four tons, requiring a crane of more than 12 tons to install. Xu Enlai didn't have such equipment, and renting it locally cost at least 800 yuan per day, 32,000 yuan for 40 days. This money could build a company library or a training ground for a regiment. Xu Enlai calculated and decided not to do it. He found the "big shot" of the small team, Zhu Hongshuang: "Can you think of a way to do this job with our equipment? I'll recommend you for an award." Zhu Hongshuang silently went to one side to ponder. The next day, a miracle happened: Zhu Hongshuang and his comrades, risking their lives, used excavators and loaders to lift the heavy culverts one by one. People below arranged and installed them. Some road construction workers watched, blinking their eyes: These soldiers are fearless. From the construction site, Xu Enlai used an old man's laughter to scratch his back and smiled: Doing anything requires spirit!

Xu Enlai might be too old-fashioned, doing things according to "tradition" wherever he went. It snowed, and they helped workers carry bicycles and sent children to school. During the busy farming season, they stopped work for a few days to help farmers harvest wheat. In a large office building under construction, there was a toilet inside, but they "conveniently" went out half a mile. Those who came to Daqing to steal oil, steal steel, and wood from other places, they saw and wouldn't let them escape, so they were called "second dogs" by others... Long-term construction clients originally had 13 construction teams to choose from, now only Xu Enlai's team remains.

Xu Enlai's small team fell in love with Daqing, and Daqing people fell in love with Xu Enlai's small team.

In six years, Xu Enlai's team built 14 roads, all of which were excellent. Several beautiful squares in Daqing City were built by them, and there are countless spiritual stories on them.

No Millionaires in the Army

In the place where the sun rises first, Xu Enlai and his small team always get up earlier than the sun. In the darkness before dawn, Xu Enlai habitually woke up, borrowing the lightning, seeing the tent filled with water, things floating under the bed. He fished out his old man's laughter from under the pillow, scratching his back, and said to the communications officer: "Ha ha, we've become the navy, I can be the naval commander." After scratching, he fished out his shoes from the water, put them on his feet, and wondered, why were they bulging? He fished out a toad that made his whole body shiver...

Before moving into the "rammed earth" house this year, our Colonel Xu Enlai and the 18 "farmer-soldiers" lived in this dilapidated shed. Grass grew under the bed, and on sunny days, grasshoppers jumped inside; on rainy days, small fish swam inside...

Heavy rain poured over the Songnen Plain, and the oil field for hundreds of miles was a vast expanse of water. Xu Enlai and his old partner, Party Secretary Cheng Xunhui, waded through the muddy water on the construction site. A 37-mile road, just the earthwork was 150,000 cubic meters, and they only had 18 soldiers, 150 hired civilian workers, and 4 old "Leifeng" trucks... How could this job be done?

The Party branch meeting, the Party member meeting, and finally, Xu Enlai gathered all the soldiers and civilian workers and said the same words: I do it this way, and you do it this way! Xu Enlai and his small team went all out again. They got up at 3:30 AM, worked until 11 PM, and had three meals a day on the construction site...

Due to overwork, Xu Enlai, this third-class disabled person, got nephritis. The test results showed five fierce "+" signs. At night, the pain tormented him on the wooden bed. He said he cried a few times, saying that tears could stop the pain a bit. When he couldn't bear it, when tears didn't work, he called the communications officer: "Go, quickly bring a knife!" "Cut here, hard!" Xu Enlai pointed to his waist. The back of the knife hit his body, one pain suppressing another. Xu Enlai's tears were printed on the soil-colored bedsheet, and the communications officer's tears splashed on Xu Enlai's waist, red and white...

For more than 80 days and nights, Xu Enlai and his comrades did not bathe, did not cut their hair, and rarely brushed their teeth. The driver's back was rubbed raw by the seat, forming scars, and then rubbed raw again, finally forming thick calluses. A few soldiers fainted on the construction site...

Xu Enlai's hard-working spirit moved the leaders and workers of the Daqing Petroleum Administration Road Construction Company. Manager Liang and Deputy Manager Jiang brought 100 vehicles to support them without charge, and on the dozens of miles of construction site, a magnificent scene of military-civilian unity was displayed...

To build this road, Xu Enlai's construction team used up 400 shovels, 600 earth baskets. The big man Cheng Xunhui wore out 3 pairs of Liberation shoes and lost 19 jin of weight...

Looking at the completed high-quality project, Xu Enlai finally collapsed. He was carried down from the construction site, his body swollen.

Xu Enlai created remarkable economic benefits and political reputation with a small number of soldiers, but also invited various rumors.

"Xu the fatso has made it, otherwise why would he work so hard!" These words were said by Xu Enlai's comrades. "Is your husband Xu mentally ill? Why would he abandon his family and work so hard?" These words were said by Xu Enlai's wife Gao Shucui's colleague. A couple, four rows of hot tears. Gao Shucui followed the army to Qiqihar for 9 years, Xu Enlai was not at home for 8 years, and in Daqing, he worked for 7 years. She raised two children alone and also worked night shifts. The children tasted the bitterness of being "imprisoned" from a young age—a click, an iron lock confined two young hearts. What made Gao Shucui most painful and fearful was that her younger son Xu Gang had epilepsy. Who knows when it would strike, and when it did, it would convulse to the point of death. Every time, she was terrified and helpless. When the child recovered, she hugged the child and cried...

"Hey, God of Wealth, we're so poor we can't open the pot."

Leaders of large units, heads of small units. Begging. Eating from the rich.

"Hey, Old Xu, can your son go to learn to drive a car or something."

Superiors, comrades, colleagues. Requests, phone calls, notes.

The problem was that Xu Enlai was stubborn—he didn't do any of it!

Thus, rumors spread.

Xu Enlai shed tears, remained silent. The higher-level discipline inspection commission, to get to the bottom of the matter, indeed sent people to investigate—there was no problem.

Xu Enlai, in front of the higher-level discipline inspection commission, shed tears, remained silent.

The members of the small team received several tens of yuan in living allowances per month, and Xu Enlai received the least. He stipulated that if sick leave exceeded 5 days, the monthly allowance would be deducted. This September, he returned home for 7 days of injections, and in the table for distributing living allowances that month, he crossed out his own name.

At the end of 1988, Xu Enlai became the political commissar of the army farm, causing a small storm: "Xu Enlai that guy used money to cover his official hat..."

What Xu Enlai found most unbearable was the lack of understanding from within the army. Xu Enlai, this compatriot of the Republic, this old soldier who has been in the army for 20 years, cried the most bitterly this time.

"No millionaires in the army! Understanding is the best!"

The Posture of Soldiers

"If Xu Enlai is written as a 'person' in uniform, only writing about the 'old-style' spirit of the 'old Yellow Cow,' not writing about the strategic vision of a strategist and the mind of an entrepreneur, it is undoubtedly missing a stroke." So said a major general of the army group.

Xu Enlai is not a "labor party." In the leaky shed, in the rammed earth house with mud walls and thatched roofs, he borrowed the light of candles, moonlight, and snowlight to gnaw through books such as "Road Engineering Technology," "Must-Read for Factory Directors and Managers," and "Management Psychology." A thousand red sunsets of the Great Northern Wilderness finally obtained a correspondence university diploma.

Talking about money is not a soldier's shame. The collective life of the army is the most tempering, the most able to produce combat effectiveness, but sometimes it is the most able to eat from the big pot and the least able to talk about economic benefits.

Xu Enlai divided his men into three teams: the driving team, the mechanical team, and the logistics team. Each team had indicators: far, near, monthly, daily.

Soldiers are not numerous but precious. Xu Enlai's subordinates were all overloaded: cook Xiao Wang not only grew vegetables, bought vegetables, and cooked, but also served as a communications officer, guarding the phone, sending messages, and distributing newspapers; driver Xiao Dong drove the command car during the day, the watering car at night, and also served as a cashier and standby cook... Time, efficiency, target management, here it was not posted on the wall, but engraved in everyone's heart.

The army doing paid labor is indeed a side force. Xu Enlai saw some armies' "human sea tactics" and thought: If you add one person here, won't the training ground be short one person? Skill is not as good as tools, can primitive tools produce high efficiency and high quality? Thus, a theory was born: the army's paid labor must transition from manpower to mechanization.

Xu Enlai's "armored troops" were organized under this theory.

Debt operation, loan of 3 million! Soldiers are swift, in January of that year, Xu Enlai set off in the blizzard. Heading north to Zhalantun and Hailar, south to Changchun, Shenyang, and Dalian, in a month's time, he traveled tens of thousands of miles, bringing in a batch of new large machinery, including 10 "Tatra" (large dump trucks) and 4 dump trucks, to the construction site. This "armored troops" marched grandly and majestically, astonishing everyone.

Even more astonishing was that Xu Enlai repaid the loan that year!

The "armored troops" launched a group assault on a vast marshland covered with reeds—a line of bulldozers like tanks roaring and charging; loaders raised their giant iron arms like rocket launchers; speeding dump trucks like armored personnel carriers rushed to occupy the starting area of the attack; groups of red-crowned cranes flying from the Zhalong Nature Reserve occasionally called out like silver planes flying overhead... Xu Enlai's towering figure stood there, like a general on the battlefield...

专栏：国庆报告文学征文

    战场没有硝烟
    杜守林　焦凡洪
    耸立在松嫩平原上的大庆油田，犹如大地母亲巨大的鼓胀的乳房喷涌着黑色乳汁——泼红英雄本色，抹绿时代图腾！
    就是在这片盛产精神的黑土地，在这片军人的没有硝烟的战场，徐恩来，一位头顶金灿灿“八一”军徽，肩扛银闪闪星花的中校，率领18个“庄稼兵”，奋战7度春秋，筑起14条总长140公里的躺着的丰碑，为军费拮据的部队，用血汗换来数百万元的利税，创造出年人均创利税10万元的奇迹！
    军人不择战场
    大雪覆盖莽莽长白山。
    东北农村大冬天的夜晚是小伙子滚烫的火炕、喷香的瓜子和燃烧的梦。19岁便是共产党员的徐恩来耐不住这长夜的寂寞，便滑冰蹚雪四处去看电影看戏。那时的银幕舞台全是一个味儿，八亿人民八台戏，就连“二人转”扭的也是“英雄”形象。老百姓说都看腻歪了，可徐恩来每看一回都过瘾。他最爱看《沙家浜》，最爱听“要像那泰山顶上一青松”，最崇拜郭建光大英雄四方威风以及他屁股后头那把盒子枪。徐恩来把大裤腰一抿，乌拉鞋一捆，立志要当兵，而且要在战场上英雄他几回。军旅，生活的绿地，枪声，世界上最美的乐章。终于，“堃铛”一声老闷罐车把雄心勃勃的徐恩来拉进了
  “大胡子师长”所在师的军营，拉进了一个雄性的生长英雄梦的世界。
    北方无战事。徐恩来由步枪换冲锋枪再换手枪。几个冬去春来，只在官衔上实现了想不到的梦。然而，那支“五四”式手枪唯一能使上劲的是最初几年在靶纸上戳几个窟窿，但这样的窟窿竟不比他的年龄多多少。“要准备早打、大打、打核战争”。开始，别人这样教育他，后来，他又如此教育别人。徐恩来仍在做“英雄梦”，他自我感觉生一副英雄相——膀大腰圆，浓眉大眼，声若宏钟，挥臂生风。然而，在一个冬春之交的傍晚，师首长表情严肃地交给他一项特殊的任务：
    带一个小分队挣四万块钱回来，部队要翻修危破的营房。
    服从命令是军人的天职。
    这一夜徐恩来又做了回“英雄梦”。
    真正的军人不择战场。
    公元1983年严冬过后的一天，人民解放军的一个“庄稼小分队”肩扛军锹军镐，在徐恩来的率领下踏着残雪向大庆进军了。
    这座新兴的美丽的石油城用陌生而困惑的目光望着这帮大兵。这里不乏宾馆酒家，可惜它们不是为战士盖的。借住吗？如果是来打仗的野营拉练的抢险救灾的，地方上自然会有安排，可他们是来找活儿干的，现在到处讲经济核算，谁来照顾这些
  “找活儿的”？还有的说：“当兵的吃着皇粮不好好练武，不务正业，挣哪门子钱！”更有穿着时髦的姑娘小伙：“你瞧这帮大兵像老山炮……”
  初春突然飘起小清雪。在大草甸子上围着篝火的小分队的战士们一个个垂着高贵的头颅，他们已经“无家可归”。
    中国士兵是古今中外最能忍辱负重，最能克服艰难险阻的士兵。徐恩来和战友们在露天里搭起帐篷，垒起了锅灶，开始了一场特殊的战斗。
    首战必胜。徐恩来摘掉了军装上的领章和帽徽，也许是客观强逼他进入一个和他的身份不协调的悲壮剧角色，他需要说一些穿着军装不便说的话，他要维护“八一”军徽的尊严，尽管在这里军人的威严几乎片甲不存。他那八月深秋高粱穗子颜色的胖脸上堆满假装的笑容，四处奔波联系劳务项目。谈判。订合同。搞预算。挤公共汽车，坐三轮，上卡车，满脑子工程、效益、时间……“堃啷”——这一天徐恩来带车去拉施工工具，他的“解放”和地方一台“东风”“亲嘴”了！徐恩来的脑袋干开了一个七厘米的大口子，像孩子的嘴，血流如注，当场昏死过去。送到医院一诊断：脑震荡，右腿环骨粉碎性骨折。殷红的血在洁白的床单上印下了一片军人的图腾——集结地域，合围，箝形攻击……软弱的绷带捆住了一个硬汉。醒来，他就问工程，要图纸，营房盖在他的心上……
    这一年，徐恩来他们以肉体的心灵沉重的代价为部队拿回了14万元。拔地而起的营房啊，你可知道你为什么是红色的吗？
    从此以后的岁月，徐恩来操起了一个和他的身份极不相称的职业，他走进了一片本不属于他们，似乎也不属于这支军队的天地。
    “铁人井”旁“写”精神
    这是一块精神的圣地。
    徐恩来一瘸一拐地来到“铁人井”旁。
    1960年3月，王铁人钻井队在这里靠人拉肩扛把40多米高的井架60多吨重的钻机设备竖起，饿了啃口窝窝头，困了披上老羊皮袄打个盹，奋战5天5夜终于打成了第一口“争气井”……望着铁人挑灯学“两论”的简陋工棚，望着寒冬里铁人跳下去用身体搅拌泥浆的水泥池，徐恩来全身的血液直往头上涌，他双眼湿润了，他寻觅到了一种宝贵的东西。
    一口油井，一个崭新的世界。
    开工了，徐恩来先带领他的“庄稼小分队”捡起了砖头。一帮20多岁的大小伙子，在鳞次栉比的楼群中，在车水马龙的公路边，在充满酒瓶易拉罐高级化妆品低劣卫生纸的垃圾堆里混得济公模样。不免有几句牢骚：“老教，我们宁回农场去种地，也不干这掉价的差使。”“老教，我给你去买一车新砖来。”更有的战士夸着海口。徐恩来笑了：
  “买一车砖，买一座砖厂我们也能买得起，你以为我要的是几块破砖头吗？我要的是一种精神！”
    几天后，数个五星状花坛点缀在公共场所。
    从此后，徐恩来他们在工地，在收工的路上，甚至外出办事，手里很少空过。石块、砖头、木棍、铁管，一年捡的碎石铺了个4000平方米的院子，每年光捡施工用的小木桩就节省四五百元。
    有个地方施工队备的料被大水淹了，人家一甩手不要了。徐恩来乐了，带着他的小分队下到水里一点一点往上捞，一个个冻得嘴唇发青，全身筛糠，几天下来，竟从水中捞出了500多吨价值一万元的石子和沙子。
    小分队的汽车拉白灰、水泥回来，四五把扫帚上车打扫“战场”，几年下来，50吨白灰，150方沙石堆得像座小山。
    “精神，我要的是一种精神！”
    两个用铁丝捆着的竹壳暖瓶，一把笨重的茶壶带一帮粗瓷大碗。这是徐恩来招待客人的家什。
    “咱们老教太抠了，一根蜡烛还规定点多长时间，这电视还是用大家捡破烂的钱买的。”有的战士偷偷的议论，“是呀，一天到晚吃土豆，都吃得我们不长个了，现在各种饮料有的是，上工地还让我们背个行军壶……”
    徐恩来老太婆一样挺慈祥地笑着来到他们身边：“论我们创造的价值，天天住宾馆吃饭店也干得起，我们不能丢掉一种精神啊！”
    又是精神。是的，一个精神万能的时代已经结束，但我们能让一个精神空虚的时代降临吗？
    今年初夏，徐恩来他们承揽的一条公路需要安装近百根涵管，每根涵管4吨重，得需要12吨以上的吊车安装。徐恩来没这玩意，到地方雇，每天最少800元， 40天3万2，这钱可建一个连队的图书馆或一个团的训练场。徐恩来算算不干了，他找到小分队的“大能人”朱洪双：“你能不能想想办法，用咱们的家什把这活干了，我给你请功。”朱洪双默默地到一边琢磨去了。第二天，奇迹出现了：朱洪双和战友们冒着生命危险，用挖掘机装载机把一根根重型涵管吊起来，人在底下摆布安装。一些地方的筑路工人看着只眨巴眼睛：这帮兵不要命了。从工地回来，徐恩来用老头乐挠着后背笑了：干什么都得有股精神！
    徐恩来也许太守旧了，走到哪里都按“传统”办事。下雪了，他们帮着工人扛自行车，送小孩上学；农忙了，他们停几天工帮助农民割麦子。在一个大机关施工，楼内就有厕所，可他们“方便”一下却跑出半里地。那些外地来大庆偷油、偷钢材、木材的，他们看到就别想溜掉，因而被人骂成“二狗子”……长期施工的甲方原有13个可供选择的施工队，如今只剩徐恩来一家。
    徐恩来的小分队爱上了大庆这个好地方，大庆人也爱上了徐恩来的小分队。
    6年来，徐恩来他们修的14条路，条条获全优。大庆市的几个漂亮广场都是他们干的，那上面凝聚着许许多多精神题材的故事。
    军中没有万元户
    在最先看到太阳的地方，徐恩来和他的小分队总比太阳起得早。黎明前的黑暗里，徐恩来又习惯地爬起来，借着雷电，见帐篷里涌满了水，床底下的东西都漂了起来。他从枕头底下摸出老头乐一下一下挠着脊梁对通信员说：“哈哈，我们成了海军了，我可以当海军司令了。”挠完了，他从水中捞起鞋子往脚上一套，咦，里边怎么鼓鼓囊囊的？一掏，一只使人浑身起鸡皮疙瘩的懒蛤蟆……
    在今年搬进“干打垒”之前，我们的徐恩来中校以及18名“庄稼兵”，就住在这破工棚里。床下长草，晴天，里面蹦着蚂蚱；雨天，里面游着小草鱼……
    暴雨在松嫩平原上下个不停，百里油田一片汪洋。徐恩来和他的老搭档——党支部书记程寻会蹚着泥水在工地上来回走着。37里的公路，光土方就15万方，而他们只有18个兵，150名雇来的民工，4台破旧的“雷锋车”……这活怎么干呀？
    支委会、党员会，最后徐恩来把所有的战士、民工都集合起来，还是那句话：我怎么干，你们怎么干！徐恩来和他的小分队又玩命了。早晨3点半起床，晚间11点收工，一日三餐吃在工地……
    由于过度劳累，徐恩来这个三等甲级残废又得了肾炎，化验单上标着五个凶狠的“＋”号。晚上，疼痛折磨的他在木板床上翻滚。他说他哭过几回，说眼泪能止点儿疼，实在忍不住，眼泪也不好使的时候，他就喊通信员：“去去，快拿把菜刀来！”“往这儿砍，使劲！”徐恩来指着腰部。菜刀背一下下往他的身上砍去，一种疼痛压迫着另一种疼痛，徐恩来的泪花印在泥土色的床单上，通信员蹦出的泪水溅在徐恩来红一道白一道的腰上……
    80多个日日夜夜，徐恩来和他的战友们没洗过澡没理过发甚至很少刷牙。驾驶员的后背被座椅磨烂了，结成疤，又磨烂，最后成了厚厚的茧子，有几名战士昏倒在工地上……
    徐恩来他们的拚命精神感动了大庆石油管理局公路工程公司的领导和职工，梁经理、姜副经理带着100台车来无偿支援他们，在数十里工地上，展现了一幅军民团结大会战的壮丽画卷……
    为了修这条路，徐恩来的施工队用坏了400把铁锹，600个土篮子，大个子程寻会穿坏了3双解放鞋，掉了19斤肉……
    望着竣工的优质工程，徐恩来终于瘫倒了，他是被抬着下工地的，人虚胖得厉害。
    徐恩来以很少的兵力用血汗创造了可观的经济效益和政治信誉，也引来了种种流言蜚语。
    “徐胖子这小子发了，要不他为什么不要命的干！”这话是徐恩来的战友说的。“你家老徐是不是精神病？这样抛家舍业的图个啥？”说这话的是徐恩来的爱人高淑清的同事。一对夫妻，四行热泪。高淑清随军到齐齐哈尔9年，徐恩来8年不在家，在大庆一干就是7年。她一人带两个孩子，还要上夜班，孩子从小尝够了“家囚”的滋味——咔嚓一声，一把铁锁禁锢了两颗童心。最使高淑清痛苦害怕的是小儿子徐钢有癫痫病，说不定啥时候就犯了，一犯病就往死里抽，每当这时她都吓得六神无主，等孩子缓过气来，她抱着孩子嚎啕大哭……
    “哎财神爷，我们穷得揭不开锅了，支援点。”
    大单位的领导，小单位的头头。化缘。吃大户。
    “哎老徐，我儿子弄你那去学开个车什么的。”
    首长，战友，同事。嘱托，电话，条子。
    事情就坏在徐恩来的犟脾气——通通不办！
    于是，谣言四起。
    徐恩来落泪，沉默。上级纪委为了把事情弄个水落石出，的确曾派人调查过——没有问题。
    徐恩来当着上级纪委同志的面，落泪，沉默。
    小分队的成员每月有几十块钱的生活补助，徐恩来拿的补助是最少的，他规定事假超过5天扣除当月补助。今年9月，他回家打了7天针，在当月发放补助费的表上他把自己的名字划掉了。
    1988年岁尾，徐恩来任集团军农场政委，又引起了不小的风波：“徐恩来那小子用钱糊了顶乌纱帽……”
    最令徐恩来难以忍受的是来自部队内部的不理解。徐恩来，这位共和国的同龄人，这个入伍20年的老兵，这次哭得最伤心。
    “军中没有万元户！理解万万岁！”徐恩来在内心呼喊。
    兵的姿态
    “如果把徐恩来当做一个穿军装的‘人’来写，只写‘老八路’作风、‘老黄牛’精神，不写战略家的胆识、企业家的头脑，无疑漏写了一捺。”集团军一位少将如是说。
    徐恩来不是“劳动党”，在四面透风的破工棚里，在泥土筑墙、草木棚顶的“干打垒”里，他借着烛光、月光和雪光，啃破了《公路工程技术》、《厂长经理必读》、《管理心理学》等书籍。一千个北大荒的夕阳红，终于获得了一张函授大学的文凭。
    讲“钱”不是军人的耻辱。部队的集体主义生活最能锻炼人，最能出战斗力，但有时也最能吃大锅饭，最不讲经济效益。
    徐恩来把他的人马分成了3个班：驾驶班、机械班、后勤班。每个班都有指标：远的、近的、月的、日的。
    兵不在多而贵精。徐恩来手下的人都在超负荷运转：炊事员小王既种菜、买菜又做饭，还兼通信员守电话、送信、发报纸；驾驶员小董白天开指挥车晚上开洒水车还当着出纳员和候补炊事员……时间，效益，目标管理，在这里没有张贴在墙上，而是刻在了每个人的心里。
    搞劳务的部队毕竟是偏军。徐恩来看到一些部队的那种“人海战术”，就琢磨：你这里多一个人，训练场不就少一个人吗？手巧不如家什妙，原始工具能出高效益高质量吗？于是一个理论就诞生了：部队有偿劳务必须由体力型向机械化转变。
    徐恩来的“装甲兵”就是在这种理论的支配下组建的。
    负债经营，贷款300万！兵贵神速，今年1月，徐恩来顶着暴风雪出发了。北上扎兰屯、海拉尔，南下长春、沈阳、大连，在一个月的时间里兼程万里，将崭新的10台“太脱拉”（大型自卸卡车）、4台翻斗车等一批大型机械开进工地，这支“装甲兵”浩浩荡荡，威风凛凛，令人惊叹不止。
    更令人惊叹的是，徐恩来当年还清了贷款！
    “装甲兵”向一片芦苇丛生的沼泽地展开了集团冲锋——一字排开的推土机像坦克怒吼着发起冲击；装载机扬起巨大的铁臂，犹如火箭发射架；疾驶的自卸车恰似装甲输送车抢占进攻出发地区；三五成群从扎龙自然保护区起飞的丹顶鹤不时鸣叫着银机般掠过上空……徐恩来魁梧的身躯立在那儿，俨然一副火线将军的姿态……
