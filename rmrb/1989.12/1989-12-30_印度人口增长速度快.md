India's population is growing rapidly. Each year, 17 million infants are born in India, which means a new baby is born every two seconds. Demographers have issued a warning: if this trend continues, by the end of the century, India's population will increase from the current 807 million to 1 billion. According to United Nations calculations, by 2025, India's population will reach 1.45 billion, while China's population will be 1.49 billion. This means that in a short time, India's population will surpass China, making it the world's most populous country.

Currently, India's population density is already twice that of China, and the living environment is clearly under pressure. Although the Indian government has long advocated for families to have only two children, most families insist on having three or four, and will not stop until they are satisfied.

    印度人口增长速度快
    印度每年有1700万婴儿出世，也就是说，每两秒钟就有一个新生儿呱呱坠地。人口学家对此发出警告：按此速度发展下去，到本世纪末，印度人口将由现在的8.07亿增至10亿。据联合国计算数字，到2025年时，印度人口将增至14.5亿，而同期的中国人口将为14.9亿，这就意味着，无须多久，印度人口就会大大超过中国，成为世界上第一号人口大国。
    目前，印度人口密度已是中国的两倍，生存环境已明显地感到压力。虽然印度政府早就提倡每个家庭只生两个孩子，但大多数家庭却非要生三到四个，不到夫妻满意是不会放弃生育的。
