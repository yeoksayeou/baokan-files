New Year's greetings, known in ancient times as "congratulations," "visits," "notes," and "door cards," have a long history in China. As early as the Han Dynasty, China already had New Year's greetings.

By the Song Dynasty, the custom of exchanging New Year's greetings became very popular. The Song Dynasty painter Li Chong's "New Year's Morning Picture" depicts the scene of the host's courtyard welcoming guests and drinking wine, with servants receiving greetings and waiting for visitors.

Afterwards, the practice of sending New Year's greetings became even more widespread. A poem in the Ming Dynasty's "Collection of Literary Works" reads: "People do not seek meetings but only send greetings, names on paper fill the humble abode in the morning; I also follow others and send a few sheets, social customs dislike simplicity but not emptiness."

During the Qing Dynasty, people began to use red single notes for New Year's greetings, writing their names on them and sending them to friends and relatives to express their New Year's wishes. Those who did not go in person but sent someone else to deliver the greetings were called "flying notes." Wealthy families would place the New Year's greetings in small wooden boxes and send them, so they were also called "visiting boxes."

In the history of Chinese New Year's greetings, there are two particularly precious examples. One is a New Year's greeting from 1920, written by a comrade from the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Communist Party. On the back of the greeting, the comrade wrote the fighting slogan from "The Communist Manifesto" that was being translated at the time: "Workers of the world, unite!" and sent it to other comrades. Another is a New Year's greeting from 1967, sent by Comrade Song Qingling to Comrade Liu Shaoqi on the eve of the New Year. The greeting simply said "Congratulations on the New Year," with the top and bottom lines written by Comrade Song Qingling herself. This greeting, which contained no other words, was a great encouragement to Comrade Liu Shaoqi and his family, who were then in a difficult situation.

    贺年片漫话
    贺年片，古时称“谒”、“刺”、“帖”及“门状”等。早在汉朝我国便有贺年片了。
    到了宋代，送帖拜年之风十分盛行。宋代画家李崇作的《岁朝图》，描写的就是新年时主人院内迎客饮酒，僮子接帖迎候的景象。
    此后，年节投递贺年片更是蔚然成风。明朝《文侍诏集》有诗云：“人不求见惟通谒，名纸朝来荡敝庐；我亦随人投数纸，世情嫌简不嫌虚。”
    清代时，人们贺年开始用红单帖，上面写上姓名送于亲朋，以表贺年。不亲自去而派人送去的，称作“飞帖”。有钱的人家把拜年帖子放在小木匣子里送去，所以又叫“拜匣”。
    在我国贺年片史上，有两张非常珍贵的贺年片。一张是1920年中国共产党上海发起组的一位同志，在新春佳节之际，将正在翻译中的《共产党宣言》的战斗口号“全世界无产者联合起来！”写在贺年片的背面寄给同志们。另一张是1967年新年前夕，宋庆龄同志像往年一样寄赠刘少奇同志一张“恭贺新年”的贺年片。不过，此贺年片除上下款是宋庆龄同志亲笔所书之外，不著一字，这对已身处厄境的少奇同志及其一家确是莫大的鼓舞。（12月24日《中国体育报》杨明亮文）
