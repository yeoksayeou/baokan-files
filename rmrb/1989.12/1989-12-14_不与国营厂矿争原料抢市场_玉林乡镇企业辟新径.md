People's Daily, Yulin, December 13th - Reporter Jiang Yaoqiang reports: The Yulin region of Guangxi has leveraged its strengths, avoided weaknesses, and focused on developing rural enterprises that do not compete with state-owned factories for raw materials, markets, or energy. This approach promotes the healthy, stable, and coordinated development of rural enterprises.

The Yulin region is one of the more economically developed, resource-rich, and culturally advanced areas in Guangxi. Leveraging these characteristics, the region has focused on developing complementary enterprises that support state-owned factories, ensuring a steady supply of raw materials and secure markets.

Luchuan County, which is not particularly resource-rich, has taken a unique approach to developing rural enterprises. The county collects waste materials such as discarded plastic films and broken glass from across the country to produce everyday items like water buckets, toilet buckets, and pig feeders that are in high demand in rural markets. There are over 50 such enterprises in the county that use waste materials as raw inputs, with their products sold in more than 20 provinces and cities, generating an annual output value of over 30 million yuan.

Due to fewer constraints on raw materials and energy, rural enterprises in the Yulin region have established a firm foothold in the market. Today, these enterprises are a significant source of local fiscal revenue. Last year, the total income of rural enterprises in the region reached 2.4 billion yuan. In the first 10 months of this year, total income increased by 14.03% compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that the total tax and profit for the year will reach 300 million yuan.

    不与国营厂矿争原料抢市场
    玉林乡镇企业辟新径
    本报玉林12月13日电　记者蒋耀强报道：广西玉林地区发挥优势，扬长避短，努力发展不与国营厂矿争原料、抢市场、夺能源的乡镇企业，促进乡镇企业健康、稳定、协调发展。
    玉林地区是广西经济较为发达、资源较为丰富、整体文化素质较高的地区。根据这些特点，这个地区在发展乡镇企业中，注意发挥优势，着眼于拾遗补缺，发展依托国营厂矿的配套型企业，基本做到原料不愁，销路不愁。
    陆川县资源不算丰富，这个县发展乡镇企业独辟蹊径。他们从全国各地收购废薄膜、碎玻璃等“垃圾”，生产农村市场极为需要的水桶、粪桶、猪食槽等日用杂品。这里以“垃圾”为原料的乡镇企业有50多家，生产的产品销往20多个省市，年产值300多万元。
    玉林地区乡镇企业由于原料、能源的制约相对较少，产品在市场上站稳了脚跟。现在，乡镇企业已成了当地地方财政收入的重要来源。去年，全地区乡镇企业总收入实现24亿元，今年头10个月，总收入比去年同期增长14.03％，预计全年税利两项可达3亿元。
