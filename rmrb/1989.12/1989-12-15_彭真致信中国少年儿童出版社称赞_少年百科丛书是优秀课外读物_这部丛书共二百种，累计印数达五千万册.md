Peng Zhen recently wrote to the China Children's Press and Publishing House to praise them for providing an excellent set of extracurricular reading materials for young people—the "Youth Encyclopedia Series." He thanked them for overcoming various difficulties to do a great job for the children and the country.

After receiving a letter and a copy of the "Youth Encyclopedia Series" from the China Children's Press and Publishing House, Peng Zhen promptly replied. In his letter, he said that educating young people and nurturing them into a new generation that loves the country, the people, labor, science, and socialism is a great cause that concerns the future of the country and the nation, ensuring that the cause of socialism and communism has successors. It is a glorious mission.

Peng Zhen believes that young people have the strongest desire for knowledge and the keenest senses. There are countless complex phenomena in the natural world and human society, and young people's minds are filled with countless questions. Children want to know everything and are eager to understand nature, society, and history. They consciously or unconsciously seek truth and find their own path. Our country and society have the responsibility to help young people correctly understand the vast and ever-changing universe, to learn about various aspects of knowledge in ancient and modern times, both domestically and internationally, and in nature and society; to help children discern right from wrong and choose the correct path in life, and to develop fully according to the needs of society and their own interests. In addition to good textbooks, we must also provide children with a large number of extracurricular reading materials that are healthy in content, rich in knowledge, and interesting, to satisfy their spiritual needs.

The letter states: Reading materials for children must be serious and scientific; otherwise, they will harm the next generation, spread fallacies, and be condemned and punished by history. Reading materials for children should also be plain and lively; otherwise, children will not understand them or be interested in them. In short, youth reading materials should be popularized under the guidance of raising standards, making them easy to understand, simple and clear, and lively and vivid.

This "Youth Encyclopedia Series" is a "key project" completed through the joint efforts of hundreds of experts. Peng Zhen said in his letter, "Your efforts will definitely bear fruit. The children will not forget you, and the motherland will not forget you. I hope you will continue to collect opinions from readers, authors, and all parties, summarize experiences, strive for further progress, and cooperate with all sectors of society to provide more and better spiritual nourishment for the children, making more contributions to their healthy growth."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th, the "Youth Encyclopedia Series," consisting of 200 books, has been meticulously compiled by the China Children's Press and Publishing House and has all been published, with a cumulative print run of 50 million copies. It has been warmly welcomed by young readers, as well as their teachers and parents.

This is the first large-scale knowledge-based encyclopedia series in the country aimed at young people. Over the past decade, more than 230 scientists, professors, writers, and a group of editors have devoted their efforts to it. The series aims to "enlighten thoughts, enrich knowledge, cultivate abilities, and arouse interest." Since the first book was published in February 1978, 28 titles have won awards in various national evaluation activities.

Readers praise the "Youth Encyclopedia Series" as the "golden key to opening the treasure trove of knowledge."

Some experts and scholars believe that the success of this series lies not only in introducing existing knowledge but also in introducing the methods of discovering this knowledge.

To meet the needs of readers, the China Children's Press and Publishing House recently selected 120 titles from the "Youth Encyclopedia Series" and published them in a bundled edition.

    彭真致信中国少年儿童出版社称赞
    少年百科丛书是优秀课外读物
    这部丛书共二百种，累计印数达五千万册
    新华社北京12月14日电  彭真同志近日致信中国少年儿童出版社称赞他们为青少年提供了一套很好的课外读物——《少年百科丛书》，感谢他们克服各种困难为孩子们，为国家做了一件大好事。
    彭真同志在收到中国少年儿童出版社的信和《少年百科丛书》后随即复信。他在信中说，对青少年进行教育，把青少年培养成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱社会主义的一代新人，是关系国家和民族的未来，保证社会主义、共产主义事业后继有人的伟大事业，是无尚光荣的。
    彭真同志认为，青少年的求知欲望最强，感觉最敏，自然界、人类社会有多少复杂现象，青少年的脑子里就有多少问题。孩子们什么事情都想知道，迫切地想要了解自然、了解社会、了解历史，自觉不自觉地在追求真理，寻找自己的道路。我们的国家和社会有责任帮助青少年正确地认识广阔无垠、气象万千的宇宙，了解古今中外、自然和社会各方面的知识；帮助孩子们辨别是非，正确选择人生的道路，根据社会的需要和自己的爱好，全面发展。除了好的课本以外，还要给孩子们提供大量内容健康、知识丰富、趣味性强的课外读物，满足他们的精神需要。
    信中写道：给孩子们的读物，必须是严肃的、科学的，否则，毒害下一代，谬种流传，会受到历史的谴责和惩罚。给孩子们的读物，又应当是通俗的、生动的，否则孩子们读不懂或引不起兴趣。总之，青少年读物应当是在提高指导下的普及，要深入浅出、通俗易懂，简单明了、生动活泼。
    这套《少年百科丛书》是几百名专家通力合作完成的“重点工程”。彭真同志在信中说，“你们的心血一定会结出丰硕的果实，孩子们不会忘记你们，祖国不会忘记你们。我希望你们继续收集读者、作者和各方面的意见，总结经验，竿头再进，与社会各方面通力合作，为孩子们提供更多、更好的精神食粮，为他们的健康成长做出更多的贡献”。
    据新华社北京12月14日电由200种图书组成的《少年百科丛书》在中国少年儿童出版社的精心构筑下已全部问世，累计印数达5000万册，深受少年读者及其老师、家长的欢迎。
    这是国内第一套以少年为对象的大型知识性百科丛书，10余年来，相继有230多位科学家、教授、作家和一批编辑为其倾注心力。这套丛书以“启迪思想、丰富知识、培养能力、引起兴趣”为宗旨，自1978年2月开始出版第一本后，已有28个品种在全国各类评奖活动中获奖。
    读者赞誉《少年百科丛书》是“打开知识宝库的金钥匙”。
    一些专家学者认为，这套丛书的成功之处在于不仅介绍现成的知识，更重要的是介绍了发现这些知识的方法。
    为满足读者需求，中国少年儿童出版社不久前从《少年百科丛书》中精选出120种，一次配套出版发行。
