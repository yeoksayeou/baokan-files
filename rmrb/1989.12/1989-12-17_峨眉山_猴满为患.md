The monkey population on Mount Emei, which once attracted tourists from all over the country, has now become a problem due to uncontrolled breeding. This has raised concerns among people.

According to survey data, in the peak tourism year of 1985, there were four monkey groups on the mountain, each active in different areas: Xixiangchi, Yuansian Temple, Jiu Laodong, and Bian Danyan. The total number was over 200. Now, the population has more than doubled to over 400. In their struggle for survival, they have expanded their territory, stealing large quantities of corn and potatoes from farmers. They also block the paths of tourists, demanding "toll money." Their tastes have become more refined, and if they are not given milk candy, peanuts, bananas, and other delicacies, they will either persistently beg or even scare tourists. Some have even chewed on the bark, plucked the flowers and fruits, and broken the branches of rare protected plants on Mount Emei such as "Sichuan Magnolia," "Emei Pseudosasa," and "Cedrus." This has caused significant damage to the ecological environment. Recently, the Mount Emei Wildlife and Plant Protection Association held an academic seminar calling for the control of the monkey problem. They have also coordinated with relevant departments to establish the "Mount Emei Commercial Monkey Development Base" to find a solution for the excessive number of monkeys.

     峨眉山“猴满为患”
    曾经引起四海游客浓厚兴趣的峨眉山猴群，经过近些年来的“无计划生育”，现已“猴满为患”，引起人们的担忧。
    据调查资料，在旅游业鼎盛的1985年，全山有猴群四支，分别活动在洗象池、遇仙寺、九老洞、扁担岩四个地域，总数量200多只。而今，竟达400多只，数量翻了一番。为了生存，它们疯狂扩大活动地盘，偷盗农民成片的玉米，土豆；集伙拦路向游人索取“买路钱”，而且口味越来越高。不给它们奶糖、花生、香蕉之类美味时，轻则软磨硬缠，重则惊吓路人。更有甚者，在峨眉山珍稀保护植物“四川木莲”、“峨眉拟单性木兰”、“穗花杉”上咬啃树皮、攀摘花果、扭断枝丫等等，造成不少生态环境损害。为此，峨眉山野生动植物保护协会近日在学术研讨会上呼吁整顿猴患。并联络有关部门联合搞“峨眉山商品猴开发基地”。为过量的猴子寻求出路。
