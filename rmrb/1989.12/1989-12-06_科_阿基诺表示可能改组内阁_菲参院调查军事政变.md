		Corazon Aquino Suggests Possible Cabinet Reshuffle
		Philippine Senate Investigates Military Coup

		Xinhua News Agency, Manila, December 5 - Philippine President Corazon Aquino today hinted that she would reshuffle her cabinet after the national situation returns to normal.

		When asked if she would reshuffle the cabinet, Mrs. Aquino said, "After the rebellion is quelled, I will review the national situation and do everything possible to make up for the damage caused by this rebellion. This review will include all members of our cabinet."

		Since taking office as president in 1986, Mrs. Aquino has reshuffled her cabinet twice, once on November 23, 1986, and again on September 9, 1987.

		According to a report from the Associated Press in Manila on December 4, the Philippine Senate today established a five-person committee to investigate the military coup that occurred from December 1 to 3, leading to a national crisis.

		The investigative group was formed under the proposal of Senator Aquilino Pimentel. Pimentel pointed out that the intelligence department of the Philippine Armed Forces was negligent and failed to thwart the coup plot in time.

		According to Senator Ernesto Maceda, preliminary investigations indicate that approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people from five military departments were involved in this coup.
