Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on May 24, 1989, titled "How Can We Remain Indifferent to the Trafficking of Women!" The county's Party committee, government, and People's Congress leaders paid great attention to this issue and instructed the public security bureau to send personnel to investigate the Yangjiatai Township in the Dabei area. The situation is reported as follows:

The situation reflected in the letter from reader Li Xingzhuang is basically true. In recent years, the phenomenon of trafficking women in our county has been on the rise, and in some places it is quite severe. This trafficking mainly occurs in more than 10 of our county's poorer townships where it is difficult to find a partner. Some outsiders collude with local traffickers to abduct young women. The buyers and locals do not want the women they buy to escape, so they are generally kept under tight surveillance. There have been instances where women who escaped were found and brought back. For example, in Qingyugou Village, Yangjiatai Township, a villager named Tian bought a "wife" who escaped multiple times but was brought back each time. He had once tied her up.

Starting from April 1, 1989, our county launched a 70-day campaign to crack down on the trafficking of women and children. A total of 175 traffickers were apprehended, including 36 from outside the county and 139 from within. Three were arrested, 65 were administratively detained, 30 were fined, and 77 received other punishments (note: those who traffic women should be severely punished by law and there should be no leniency). Twenty-five women were rescued, and the rescue of other trafficked women is ongoing. This has effectively curbed the arrogance of criminals and stabilized social order.

    打击人贩子　解救受难女
    你报1989年5月24日第六版刊登《对拐卖妇女怎能无动于衷！》的读者来信后，我县县委、政府、人大领导对此很重视，责成公安机关派人赴大悲片区杨家台乡调查。现将情况反映如下：
    读者李行庄来信反映的情况基本属实。近年来，我县的拐卖妇女现象有所抬头，个别地方甚至很严重。这种拐卖现象主要发生在我县比较贫困、找对象困难的10多个乡。一些外地人贩子伙同本地人贩子，拐卖女青年。买方及当地人都不愿买来的妇女逃走，普遍看管较紧，有些妇女跑后又找回的事也常有发生。如杨家台乡青榆沟村村民田某买的“媳妇”逃跑多次，又多次被找回，他曾对“媳妇”采取过捆绑手段。
    1989年4月1日开始，我县开展了一场为期70天的打击拐卖妇女儿童犯罪活动的工作，共计查获人贩子175人，其中外地人贩子36人，本地人贩子139人；依法逮捕3人，治安拘留65人，罚款30人，其它处理77人（按：对拐卖妇女的罪犯，应该依法从严打击，绝不能手软），解救25名妇女，其他被拐卖妇女的解救工作正在进行，有效地打击了犯罪分子的嚣张气焰，稳定了社会治安秩序。
