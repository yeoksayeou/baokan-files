More than 82 million voters across Brazil went to the polls today for the second round of elections to choose between the two leading candidates, Collor and Lula, for the presidency.

The Brazilian elections began on November 15, with the first round of voting resulting in none of the 21 presidential candidates securing more than half of the votes. According to the constitutional procedure, a second round of voting was held between the top two candidates. In the first round, Fernando Collor de Mello of the National Reconstruction Party (PRN) led, followed by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party (PT). Thus, the new round of elections will determine the winner between these two candidates.

Both parties and candidates are evenly matched in terms of strength and influence, making the competition particularly intense.

Collor has the support of the business community and a significant portion of the middle and upper classes, showing a clear advantage in the first round. Meanwhile, Lula's Workers' Party has formed an alliance with other parties known as the "Brazilian People's Front," gaining support from the Democratic Labour Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Brazilian Communist Party, among other left-wing forces, significantly boosting their strength for the new round of elections.

According to pre-election polls, Lula's "intended votes" were just one percentage point behind Collor's. Both presidential candidates claim they will defeat their opponent, but the final verdict will be determined by the vote count.

    巴西举行第二轮大选
    本报巴西利亚12月17日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西全国8200多万选民今天再次涌向各地投票站参加第二轮大选，从第一轮选举得票最多的两名候选人科洛尔和卢拉中选出下届总统。
    巴西大选从11月15日开始举行，第一轮选举结果，参加总统角逐的21名候选人得票均未达到半数，只好按宪法规定的程序，从得票最多的前两名候选人中进行第二轮投票。在第一轮选举中，国家复兴党候选人科洛尔名列首位，劳工党候选人卢拉名列第二，因此新的一轮选举就从这两名候选人中产生新总统。
    从两党及两位总统候选人的实力和影响来看，可谓旗鼓相当，难分上下，竞争也就格外激烈。
    科洛尔有工商企业界和大部分中、上层人士作后盾，在第一轮选举中已展现出很大优势，而卢拉的劳工党则与其它党派结成“巴西人民阵线”，在新的一轮竞选中又获得民主工党、社会民主党以及巴西共产党等左派势力的支持，力量大大加强。
    根据投票前夕的民意调查，卢拉获得的“意向选票”只比科洛尔低一个百分点。这两位总统候选人都声称自己必能战胜对手，但到底谁胜谁负，只能由选票统计数字作出最后裁决。
