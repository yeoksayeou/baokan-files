The Art of War by Sun Tzu, along with the teachings of Confucius, represents the pinnacle of wisdom in ancient China. Since its publication 2,501 years ago, The Art of War has gradually gained recognition and admiration worldwide.

Japan, separated from China by a narrow strip of water, was the first country after China to embrace Sun Tzu's ideas. As early as the Tang Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, Japanese scholars studying in China brought back The Art of War. To this day, Japan has over 170 prominent scholars who have published more than 200 research monographs on the subject. Besides Japan and other Eastern countries, Western nations such as France, Britain, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Czechoslovakia have also translated The Art of War. Last year, former U.S. President Nixon's book "1999: Victory Without War" directly applied Sun Tzu's great idea of "subduing the enemy without fighting."

"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but upon our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable." This is the most important strategic thought in the thirteen chapters of The Art of War, and it still shines brightly today. The United States, which first invented the "nuclear deterrence strategy," found its theoretical basis in Sun Tzu's idea of "subduing the enemy without fighting." Some developing countries, seeking "self-preservation and complete victory," are also actively seeking non-warfare strategies. Thus, Sun Tzu's ideas of "attacking by stratagem" and "attacking by alliances" have become the most commonly used forms of struggle in today's international arena.

The thoughts in The Art of War are grand. It is a military treatise, a philosophy, and a comprehensive study of politics, economics, and diplomacy. Many famous strategists and business leaders around the world have drawn on the strategic thoughts of The Art of War for their theories and business successes.

    《孙子兵法》走向世界
    孔子与孙子一文一武，是出现在中国这块古老土地上的两颗智慧巨星。《孙子兵法》问世2501年以来，已逐渐为世人所重视与喜爱。
    一衣带水的日本是继中国之后最早接受孙子思想的国家。早在1200多年前的唐玄宗时代，日本留唐学者就带回了《孙子兵法》。至今，日本著名的研究者已达170多人，出版研究专著200多种。除日本等东方诸国，西方的法、英、德、美、俄、捷等国也先后翻译了《孙子兵法》。去年美国前总统尼克松撰写的《一九九九——不战而胜》一书，更直接运用了孙子“不战而屈人之兵”的伟大思想。
    “不战而屈人之兵”是《孙子兵法》十三篇中最重要的战略思想，至今尤显其金石般的光辉。首先发明了“核威慑战略”的美国，就是从孙子的“不战而屈人之兵”的思想中找到理论根据的。而一些发展中国家，为求“自保而全胜”，也积极寻找非战争的斗争策略。这样，孙子“伐谋”、“伐交”为上的思想，又成了今天国际斗争中运用最多的斗争形式。
    《孙子兵法》的思想是恢宏的，它是兵书，也是哲学，又是政治、经济、外交诸学的综合。世界许多著名的战略管理学家和大企业家，他们的理论和商业成功都借鉴了《孙子兵法》的战略思想。（11月18日《四川日报》宗新文　王敏才摘）
