Color TV Transmitter Listed as National-Level New Product

	BEIJING, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- A 10-kilowatt, 411-type color TV transmitter developed by the Beijing Radio Equipment Factory has recently passed the ministry-level design and production type test, filling a domestic gap. This transmitter is suitable for large and medium-sized cities' television stations. Compared to the meter-wave electronic tube transmitter, it has more channels, a larger coverage area, higher reliability, and a longer service life. Previously, China relied on imports for such equipment. The state has listed this machine as a national-level major new product and an import-substituting new product. Currently, 23 units are in use at television stations in Shanghai, Qingdao, and other cities.
