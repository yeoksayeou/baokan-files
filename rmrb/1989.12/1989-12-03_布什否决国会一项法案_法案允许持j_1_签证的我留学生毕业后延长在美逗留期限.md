U.S. President Bush today vetoed a resolution passed by the U.S. Congress. The resolution would have allowed Chinese students studying in the U.S. on J-1 visas to extend their stay in the country after graduation.

Bush stated that Congress's passage of this resolution infringed upon the president's authority in the realm of foreign policy. He has instructed relevant government departments to take similar measures, making Congress's resolution unnecessary. The resolution, titled the "1989 Emergency Chinese Immigration Assistance Act," was passed by the U.S. Congress earlier this month. It would have granted approximately 40,000 Chinese students currently studying in the U.S. a four-year visa extension upon graduation and provided them with the opportunity to apply for permanent residency in the U.S.

    布什否决国会一项法案
    法案允许持J—1签证的我留学生毕业后延长在美逗留期限
    新华社华盛顿11月30日电  美国总统布什今天否决了美国国会的一项决议，这项决议允许持有J—1签证的在美留学的中国学生在留学毕业后延长在美的逗留期限。
    布什说，国会通过这项决议是在外交政策方面对总统权力的侵犯。他正指令政府有关部门采取类似的措施，因而国会的这项决议是没有必要的。美国国会于本月初通过的这项名为“1989年中国移民紧急援助法案”的决议，准许给予目前在美留学的约4万中国学生以毕业后4年的签证延长期，并为他们提供申请在美永久居留的机会。
