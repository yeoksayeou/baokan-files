A severe cold air mass of unprecedented strength struck two-thirds of the eastern United States on the 17th, causing temperatures in at least ten states to drop below zero. The cold wave shows no signs of abating.

The U.S. National Weather Service reported that temperatures in 38 cities have reached historic lows, with Cincinnati, Ohio, in the Midwest recording a low of minus 22 degrees Celsius.

At least 19 people have died in the cold wave, with nine of them killed in traffic accidents caused by heavy snow. Many of the victims were homeless people who froze to death outdoors.

    强冷空气袭击美国东部地区
    一股前所未有的极地强冷空气十七日袭击了美国东部三分之二的地区，至少有十个州的气温因此降至零度以下。这股寒流迄今未见减弱之势。
    美国国家气象局报告说，三十八个城市的气温已经降至历史最低点，位于中西部的俄亥俄州辛辛那提市气温低达摄氏零下二十二度。
    至少已有十九人在这股寒流中丧生，其中九人死于大雪造成的交通事故。多人是冻死在外的无家可归者。
