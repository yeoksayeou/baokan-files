Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State, recently inspected the Sanzhao Island Airport in Zhuhai.

Wang Zhen said, "The conditions here are very good. We should fully utilize it, attract foreign investment, and expand it into a large international airport as soon as possible. This is to serve the Party Central Committee's strategic deployment for the Special Economic Zones to further reform and open up, and to serve the Four Modernizations."

Sanzhao Island Airport was an important airbase for the Japanese imperialists to bomb Guangzhou, Foshan, and Hong Kong, and to invade China. In January 1938, the invading Japanese army drove out approximately 4,000 laborers from Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and other places, forcing them onto Sanzhao Island to secretly build the airport. They also carried out a "clearing of the island," brutally massacring more than 8,000 of our compatriots, many of whom were elderly, women, and children. When the Japanese army surrendered and withdrew in 1945, they blew up the 1,400-meter runway. Since then, the farmers of Sanzhao Island have used the airport as a drying field. Last year, the farmers of Sanzhao Island raised 20 million yuan to fill in and repair the 1,246 "plum blossom pits" on the runway, making it new again.

Wang Zhen, along with Yang Xiushan and Huang Xinting, members of the Central Advisory Commission, and revolutionary veterans such as Xue Ming, the wife of Marshal He Long, Lin Yueqing, the wife of Marshal Luo Ronghuan, and Hao Zhiping, the wife of General Luo Ruiqing, paid their respects to the spirits of the compatriots who died on the island.

Wang Zhen told the reporter, "This is ironclad evidence of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. But not many people know about it. We must expose it and fully utilize it. Utilizing the airport itself is an exposure. It should be used as a good teaching material for educating the younger generation."

Experts and scholars from Japan and Beijing have repeatedly inspected the Sanzhao Island Airport and believe that the island, whether in terms of airspace, geology, wind direction, or geographical environment, has the conditions to build a large international airport. Wang Zhen fully agreed with the opinions of domestic and foreign experts. When two planes took off one after the other from the newly repaired concrete runway and soared into the blue sky, Wang Zhen and the generals watched them deeply, until they disappeared into the distant horizon.

    王震视察珠海三灶岛机场
    闲置44年的大型机场已开始修复试用
    本报珠海12月9日电　记者王楚报道：国家副主席王震日前视察了珠海三灶岛机场。
    王震副主席说，这个机场条件很好，要充分利用，引进外资，把它早日扩建成大型国际机场。为贯彻落实党中央关于特区要更加改革、更加开放的战略部署服务，为四化建设服务。
    三灶岛机场是日本帝国主义当年轰炸广州、佛山、香港，侵略我国的重要空军基地。1938年1月，侵华日军驱赶日本、台湾、朝鲜等地劳工约4000余名，强行登上三灶岛，秘密修建机场，并实行“清岛”，血腥屠杀我同胞8000多人，其中，不少是老人、妇女和儿童。1945年日军投降撤退时，将机场1400多米跑道炸毁。从此，三灶岛农民把机场当晒场。去年，三灶岛农民集资200万元，把跑道上被炸的1246个“梅花坑”，填平修复一新。
    王震和中顾委委员杨秀山、黄新廷将军，革命老前辈贺龙元帅的夫人薛明、罗荣桓元帅的夫人林月琴、罗瑞卿大将的夫人郝治平等，凭吊岛上死难同胞的英灵。
    王震副主席告诉记者，“这是日本帝国主义侵略我国的铁证。但知道的人并不多，要揭露它，又要充分利用它。利用机场本身就是揭露。要把它当作教育青年一代的好教材。”
    日本、北京等地航空专家、学者多次考察三灶岛机场，认为该岛无论从净空、地质条件，还是从风向、地理环境，都具备搞大型国际机场。王震完全赞同中外专家的意见。当两架飞机从新修的水泥跑道上先后呼啸升空，飞上蓝天时，王震和将军们深情地注视着，直到它们消失在遥远的天边。
