The U.S. government has long pursued a policy of "excessive military buildup," producing vast quantities of conventional and nuclear weapons, resulting in severe contamination by radioactive materials and toxic waste in many parts of the United States. The pollution at these sites has become a thorny issue that the U.S. government finds difficult to resolve.

According to reports, 3,000 toxic sites exist in 17 nuclear weapons factories under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Energy. In 600 military installations, there are 6,000 toxic waste dumps. Over 7,200 sites previously owned by the Department of Defense have become hopeless areas. The number of polluted sites in facilities under other government departments has not yet been tallied.

The substances released from these polluted sites are extremely dangerous. According to government estimates, the Fernald nuclear weapons plant in Ohio has released 395,000 pounds of uranium into the air and 162,000 pounds into the water since 1951. Additionally, the radioactive and toxic materials stored in pits, tanks, and barrels at this plant have leaked and contaminated the groundwater near the factory. The Hanford weapons plant in Richland, Washington, has dumped 200 billion gallons of hazardous waste into pits and small lakes, polluting at least 100 square miles of groundwater. The highly radioactive materials stored in underground tanks total 45 million gallons, and the plutonium leaking from these tanks could be used to make over 50 Nagasaki-type atomic bombs. The most toxic waste site is the 27-square-mile Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver.

Over the past 30 years, the Army and Shell Oil Company have dumped 125 types of chemicals used in the production of poison gas and pesticides. Other defense facilities have polluted the water supply aquifers of many cities, including Miami and Tucson. Tests have shown that the groundwater contains carcinogenic substances at levels 5,000 times higher than the safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency at the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey and 20,000 times higher than those at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Independence, Missouri.

Severe military pollution has led to a significant increase in cancer rates in many parts of the United States. Investigations have found that residents living near the Fernald nuclear weapons plant have inhaled uranium dust at levels 70 times higher than the standards set by the Department of Energy, with 162 people developing cancer. The toxic waste from the Otis Air Force Base near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, has contaminated all the water supply aquifers. Since 1982, the overall cancer rate in the area around this base has risen by more than 30% above the state average. The rates of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, leukemia, and melanoma in some towns in this region are also significantly higher than the state average.

The health hazards posed by military pollution have caused considerable unease and opposition among many residents. Many citizen groups are demanding that the government accelerate the cleanup of these polluted sites. In January, the governors of three states with 12 nuclear weapon manufacturing plants traveled to Washington to urge the federal government to take action to eliminate military pollution.

However, the U.S. government's progress in addressing military pollution has been slow. Since the military base restoration work began in 1975, only 185 of the 6,000 toxic sites have been restored to normal. Of the 125 severely polluted military facilities listed for priority cleanup under the national superfund, only 6 have been fully restored.

An article in *U.S. News & World Report* magazine points out that the cleanup of radioactive and chemical waste from U.S. nuclear weapons plants and military facilities is becoming the largest, most difficult, and most expensive task in American history. The technical challenges it presents are comparable to the Apollo moon landing and the space shuttle program. The estimated cost is around $130 billion. However, the U.S. government is burdened with a heavy fiscal deficit and cannot allocate much money for this purpose. President Bush admits that while discussing the cleanup of pollution is easy, actually doing it is not. Now, some U.S. officials are increasingly aware that due to the extremely high costs, the severity of the pollution, and technical limitations, it is unlikely that these military facilities can be completely cleaned up. They believe that some of the most dangerous polluted sites may be covered up or fenced off as "no-man's-land" or "national sacrifice zones," permanently abandoning these polluted sites. This not only threatens the lives of current Americans but will also leave a lasting legacy for future generations.

    美国的“军事污染”
    徐炳和
    美国政府长期以来推行“超军备”政策，生产了大量的常规武器和核武器，使得美国许多地方被放射性物质和有毒废物严重污染。这些场所的污染问题已成为美国政府难以解决的一个棘手问题。
    据报道，美国能源部所属17个核武器工厂有3000个有毒场所；在美国600个军事设施里有6000个有毒垃圾堆；原属国防部财产的7200多个地方已经成了无希望地区；政府其它部门所属设施的污染场所尚未统计在内。
  这些污染场所释放出来的物质非常危险。据政府估计，俄亥俄州弗尔纳德核武器工厂1951年以来，在生产过程中已把39.5万磅铀排放到空气中，16.2万磅铀排放到水里。另外，这家工厂储存在坑里、罐里和桶里的放射性和有毒物质已经渗漏并污染了工厂附近的地下水。华盛顿州里奇兰的汉福德武器工厂已把2000亿加仑危险废物倒入坑里和小湖里，至少污染了附近100平方英里的地下水。储入地下罐里的强放射性物质有4500万加仑，从罐里渗漏出来的钚能够制造50多枚长崎型原子弹。最有毒的废物场所是丹佛附近的27平方英里的落基山兵工厂。
    30年来，陆军和壳牌石油公司倾倒了用于制造毒气和杀虫剂的125种化学物质。其它防务设施已经污染了迈阿密、图森等许多城市的供水蓄水层。经化验，地下水所含致癌物质比环保局在新泽西州皮卡蒂尼兵工厂规定的安全标准高5000倍，比密苏里州因德彭登斯附近的莱克城陆军军火工厂高2万倍。
    严重的军事污染已使美国许多地方居民的致癌率明显上升。据调查，住在弗尔纳德核武器工厂附近的居民已经吸入的铀粉尘，为能源部规定标准的70倍左右，有162人得了癌症。马萨诸塞州科德角附近的奥蒂斯空军基地的有毒废物已污染了科德角提供饮水的全部蓄水层。1982年以来，这个基地周围的综合癌症率已上升到高出州平均水平30％以上。该地区一些城镇的肺癌、结肠直肠癌、乳腺癌、膀胱癌以及白血病和黑素瘤，也大大超过州的平均水平。
    军事污染危害人体健康的情况已引起许多居民的不安和反对。很多公民团体要求政府加速清理污染。在12个制造原子弹工厂的州中，有3个州的州长今年1月到华盛顿要求联邦政府采取清除军事污染的行动。
    但美国政府处理军事污染的工作进展缓慢。自1975年开始军事基地修复工作以来，军方6000个有毒场所仅185个已恢复正常。已被列入全国特别基金优先清理的125个严重污染的军事设施中，只有6个修复完毕。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志发表文章指出，在美国核武器工厂和军事设施清除放射性和化学废物，正在成为美国历史上最大、最艰难和最花钱的工作。它所提出的技术挑战相当于阿波罗登月和航天飞机计划。它所需之费用大概为1300亿美元。但美国政府财政赤字包袱沉重，拿不出多少钱来。布什总统承认，讨论清除污染的问题是容易的，但要清除就不容易了。现在，有些美国官员越来越清楚地认识到，由于极高的费用，污染的严重程度和技术上的局限性，要使这些军事设施完全清除污染是不大可能的。他们认为，一些最危险的污染场所可能被盖起来或圈起来，作为“无人地带”或“国家牺牲区”永远抛弃这些污染场所不仅威胁着当今美国人的生命安全，而且将遗祸子孙后代。
