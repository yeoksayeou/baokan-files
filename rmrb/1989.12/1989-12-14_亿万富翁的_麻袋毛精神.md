It may be hard to believe, but in the Jilin Chemical Industry Company, which generates over 100 million yuan in taxes annually, even the fine fibers falling off burlap sacks are treasured and recycled.

In the dye factory's supply warehouse, Li Yunshan, an old worker who was the first to collect burlap fibers, showed the reporter his calloused hands and said, "The factory is full of treasures. If you relax your grip, tens of millions of yuan worth of materials will flow away; if you tighten your grip, hundreds of millions of yuan worth of wealth will come in." In the three years he managed the burlap sack warehouse, this old worker voluntarily collected over 100,000 burlap sacks for the company each year. He cleaned the dirty ones and repaired the torn ones. He also shook out the remaining materials from the sacks, collecting over 30,000 kilograms a year. Even the fine fibers falling off the burlap sacks, he swept up with a broom. Over time, he collected over 1,000 kilograms of burlap fibers for the enterprise. Later, Li Yunshan went on to manage the iron bucket warehouse. He led three women to collect over 100,000 iron buckets a year, and made a workbench to repair over 10,000 damaged iron buckets annually, saving the enterprise nearly 3 million yuan.

Since 1986, the company's party committee has vigorously promoted Li Yunshan's spirit throughout the company. Now, the "burlap fiber spirit" has become a widespread practice. The reporter saw in various factories under the company that many workshop corners have treasure chests and recycling bins, and there are regeneration stations and waste recycling groups. From small items like screws, wires, and welding heads to large items like pipelines, valves, and pumps, as well as waste gas, waste water, and waste residue, everything is collected, processed, and reused. In the past three years, the entire company has saved and earned 40 to 70 million yuan through repairing and reusing old items, and by October of this year, it had already reached 76.44 million yuan.

The party committee members told the reporter, "The 'burlap fiber spirit' being able to form a trend in Jilin Chemical is inseparable from the leaders' leading by example. The company leadership has changed several times, but the office has always been that small north room of only a dozen square meters, and even the office desk is from the 1950s. In recent years, as the company's profits have soared, someone suggested improving the working conditions for the leaders. Manager Huo Ronghua believes that spending less money today means earning ten times more tomorrow. Only thrift can lead to development, and only hardship can lead to success!"

    亿万富翁的“麻袋毛精神”
    新华社记者  赵玉庆
    也许人们难以相信，在吉林化学工业公司这个年创利税10余亿元的大企业里，连麻袋片上掉落的丝丝细毛也要珍惜、回收。
    在公司染料厂供销仓库，最早收集麻袋毛的老工人李云山，伸出布满厚茧的手对记者说：“工厂到处是财宝。松一松手，几十万元的物资流走了；紧一紧手，百八十万元的财富进来了。”在管理麻袋库的3年中，这位老工人每年主动为公司回收包装麻袋10万多条。脏了的清洗，破了的修补。他还把麻袋里残留的物料抖净，汇集起来，一年竟有3万多公斤。就是麻袋片脱落下来的细毛，他也用笤帚扫起来。日积月累，他为企业收集的麻袋毛竟达1000多公斤。李云山后来又去管理铁桶库，他领着3名妇女一年回收了10多万只铁桶，还自制了一个工作台，每年修复破损的铁桶1万多只，为企业节约近30万元。
  1986年开始，公司党委在全公司大力提倡李云山的这种精神，如今“麻袋毛精神”已蔚然成风。记者在公司所属各厂看到许多车间角落里都设置了百宝柜、回收箱，建立了再生站、修旧利废小组，小至螺钉、铁丝、电焊头，大至管线、阀门、机泵，以及废气、废水、废渣，都有人回收、加工、再生利用。近3年来，全公司修旧利废，每年可减损增收400万至700万元，今年1至10月已达764.4万元。
    公司党委的同志告诉记者，“麻袋毛精神”能在吉化形成风气，是和领导干部以身作则分不开的。公司领导换了几届，办公室一直是那间只有十几平方米的北屋，连办公桌也是50年代留下的。近几年公司利润激增，有人提出给领导改善工作条件，经理霍荣华认为，今天少花一笔钱，明天就能多赚十笔钱。只有勤俭才能发展，艰苦才能创业！
