In China, the tragedies caused by the feudal "parent-arranged marriages" system for children are well-known. However, today, some children are interfering with their parents' marital freedom.

From ancient times, parents arranging their children's marriages has been a way to maintain feudal ethics and morality. The reasons for children interfering with their parents' marital freedom are more complex. Some do it to preserve "face," believing that their parents' remarriage makes them "lose face"; some do it to protect their inherited interests, fearing that their parents' remarriage will affect their inheritance of property; some treat their single parents as servants, feeling that their parents' remarriage means they can no longer be bossed around; some see the elderly as "money trees" or "political backers," worrying that their parents' remarriage will cause them to lose political and economic support, etc. If parents interfering with their children's marital freedom is due to feudal thoughts, then children interfering with their parents' marital freedom not only contains a strong feudal stench but also reflects extreme selfishness and the resulting hypocrisy and cold-heartedness between people. Because they do not consider their parents' emotional loneliness and pain, they ignore the elderly's right to love and be loved. They have not shed the old morality of the feudal and bourgeois classes, and they lack the new morality of socialism.

Since the law guarantees marital freedom, it naturally includes the marital freedom of single elderly people. Why do many remarried parents yield to their children's interference? It should be noted that children's various obstacles are one aspect, and there is also interference from society or groundless ridicule and slander, especially the old consciousness within the elderly themselves, which suppresses them spiritually and morally. Sometimes, they have to hide this reasonable, rational, and legal pursuit of love deep in their hearts, spending their later years in loneliness.

In the past, we paid a lot to fight for the marital freedom of young people; it seems that today, to fight for the marital freedom of the elderly, we still have to pay a price. I advise these children to return marital freedom to your parents.

### 子女不该干涉父母婚姻

    子女不该干涉父母婚姻
    在中国，由于封建的“父母包办婚姻”制度给子女酿成的悲剧，是人所共知的。可是，今天，有些子女却又“干涉”起父母的婚姻自由来。
    自古以来，父母包办子女的婚姻，是维护封建的伦理道德。而子女干涉父母的婚姻自由，原因就比较复杂了，有的为保全“面子”，认为父母再婚给他们“丢人现眼”；有的为维护将得的利益，怕父母再婚影响自己对财产的继承；有的把孤身父母当作奴仆，觉得父母再婚不能任意使唤；有的把老人看成“摇钱树”、“政治靠山”，担心父母再婚失去政治经济依托等等。如果说父母干涉子女婚姻自由是封建思想作怪的话，那么，子女干涉父母婚姻自由，不仅从骨子里含有十足的封建霉味，而且还反映了资产阶级的极端利己主义和由此带来的人与人之间的虚伪与冷酷无情。因为他们根本不考虑父母感情上的孤独和痛苦，无视老人爱和被爱的权利。既没有摆脱封建阶级和资产阶级的旧道德，更缺乏社会主义的新道德。　　既然法律保障婚姻自由，当然也包括孤身老人的婚姻自由，为什么许多再婚的父母会屈从于子女的干涉？应该看到，子女的百般阻挠是一方面，还有社会的干涉或无端的嘲笑和诽谤，特别是来自老年人自身旧意识的束缚，使他们在精神上道德上受到重重压抑，有时不得不把这种合情、合理、合法的对爱的追求，偷偷埋藏在心底，孤独地度过自己的晚年。
    过去，我们为争取青年人的婚姻自由，曾付出过不少代价；看来，今天为争取老年人的婚姻自由，还是要付出代价的。奉劝这些子女，把婚姻自由还给你们的父母吧。
