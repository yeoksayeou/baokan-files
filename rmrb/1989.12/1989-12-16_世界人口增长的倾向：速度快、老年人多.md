According to recent figures released by demographers, the world's population is growing at an unprecedented rate, with the overall trend being rapid growth and aging.

Between 1974 and 1987, the world's population increased from 4 billion to 5 billion. It is projected that by the end of this century, the population will reach 6 billion, 8 billion by the year 2022, and possibly 10 billion by the end of the 21st century.

The continents of Asia and Africa are experiencing the fastest population growth. Over the next 20 years, Asia's population is expected to reach 4 billion (it was 1 billion in 1950), while Africa's population is likely to double to over 1 billion. The rapid population growth in Africa will inevitably lead to environmental degradation, and agricultural development will struggle to keep up with population growth.

The population development in Latin America is also concerning, particularly the high urbanization rates in some countries. For example, the populations of São Paulo and Mexico City are both expected to reach 25 million soon.

Another issue is the increasing number of elderly people due to improvements in medical and health conditions, among other factors. In 1950, the average life expectancy was 41 years in developing countries and 66 years in developed countries. In recent years, these figures have risen to 61 and 75 years, respectively, with some countries reaching 85 years. It is estimated that in 20 years, there will be 1 billion elderly people on Earth. The aging of the population will bring a series of social problems.

Experts urge that all countries should pay high attention to population issues and implement planned and controlled population policies.

### 世界人口增长的倾向：速度快、老年人多

    世界人口增长的倾向：
    速度快、老年人多
    根据人口学专家最近发表的数字，世界人口正以前所未有的速度向前增长，总的倾向是，速度太快和老年化。
    1974年至1987年间，世界人口从40亿增加到50亿。预计本世纪末将达60亿，公元2022年80亿，至21世纪末可能达到100亿。
    人口增长最快的是亚、非两大陆。今后20年，亚洲人口可达到40亿（1950年为10亿），非洲则可能翻番而超过10亿。非洲人口增长的速度势必使环境遭到破坏，农业发展依然无法跟上人口增长的速度。
    拉美人口发展也令人担心，尤其是某些国家的城市化程度太高，比如圣·保罗、墨西哥城两市的人口很快都将达到2500万。
    另一个问题是，由于医疗卫生条件的改善以及其它原因，老年人将越来越多。1950年的人口平均寿命，发展中国家为41岁，发达国家为66岁，而近些年来已分别达到61岁和75岁，有的国家达到85岁。人们预计20年后，地球上将有10亿老年人。人口的老龄化，将带来一系列社会问题。
    专家们呼吁，各国都应高度重视人口问题，实行有计划、有控制的人口政策。
