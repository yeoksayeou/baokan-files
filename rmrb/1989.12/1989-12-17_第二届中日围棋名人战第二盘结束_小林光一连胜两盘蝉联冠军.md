The Second Match of the Second China-Japan Go Championship Concludes
Kobayashi Koichi Wins Two Consecutive Matches to Retain the Title

Beijing, December 16 - Reporter Chen Zhao reports: Chinese Go player Ma Xiaochun, 9th dan, ultimately failed to break through the formidable defense of the top Japanese player. In the second match of the China-Japan Go Championship sponsored by CITIC, Ma Xiaochun lost in the middle game. Kobayashi Koichi won with a score of 2:0, successfully retaining his title.

In this match, Ma Xiaochun played white, so his initial strategy was to establish a solid defense and wait for an opportunity to advance. However, his 8th move of a small flying invasion was too cautious and gained little advantage. Following this, in a transformation in the upper part of the board, he was surrounded by black stones, making the situation for white stones quite severe. By the time the morning session ended with 81 moves, Ma Xiaochun had used nearly 40 minutes more than his opponent.

In the afternoon, to reverse the unfavorable situation, Ma Xiaochun played moves 92 and 94, aiming to surround two black stones and extend his influence into the large empty space in the upper part of the board. The game suddenly became chaotic, with a complex situation on the board.

Facing a difficult-to-read board, Kobayashi Koichi, who usually plays quickly, took nearly 50 minutes to consider his 109th move. Experts in the observation room proposed four schemes: bend, cut, point, and attack. However, Kobayashi Koichi chose a different approach. Some people thought that white stones had a glimmer of hope.

However, at a critical moment, Ma Xiaochun made a mistake by playing a move in the upper right corner. Black stones seized the initiative, consolidating a piece on the left side, thus gaining a complete advantage on the board.

This match ended with 241 moves. Ma Xiaochun, upon reviewing the board, felt that the count of stones was insufficient and conceded defeat.

After the match, Ma Xiaochun said, "Kobayashi Koichi indeed has formidable strength. When Akiyoshi Atsushi competed with Kobayashi Koichi for the Japanese title this year, he lost and said he had given his all. I have the same feeling."

    第二届中日围棋名人战第二盘结束
    小林光一连胜两盘蝉联冠军
    本报北京12月16日讯　记者陈昭报道：中国棋手马晓春九段最终未能突破日本超一流棋手的牢固防线，在中信杯中日围棋名人战的第二盘比赛中中盘告负。小林光一以2∶0的成绩蝉联冠军。
    这盘棋由于马晓春执白，所以他的意图一开始即是建立稳固的后防，伺机冲入敌阵。但他的第8手小飞过于求稳，所获不大。紧接着，在上方的一场转换中，被黑棋围起一块大空，白棋顿显形势严峻。上午封盘时走了81手，马晓春用时又比对方多了40几分钟。
    下午开局后，马晓春为了扭转不利局面，放出92、94两个胜负手，一方面围住黑棋两子，另一方面把触角伸入黑上方的大空，棋盘上一下变成混战局面，形势复杂。
    面对难以看清的棋局，一惯落子飞速的小林光一在109手长考了近50分钟，专家们在观战室中摆出了拐、断、尖、打出四种方案，但小林光一却偏偏长了一手。有人认为，白棋露出一线曙光。
    然而，马晓春关键时刻在右上角走了一手扳，这是一个失误。黑棋乘机争得先手，巩固了左边的一块棋，从而在盘面上占得完全的优势。
    这盘棋共下了241手，马晓春最后清点盘面，觉得子数不够，于是投子认输。
    马晓春赛后说，小林光一确实有强大的实力。淡路修三在与小林光一争夺今年日本名人冠军时，输了之后自称尽了120分的努力，我也有此感觉。
