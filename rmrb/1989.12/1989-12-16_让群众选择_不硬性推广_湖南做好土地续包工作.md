Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 15th — (Reporter Yang Shancheng) Hunan Province has timely conducted land contract renewal work in areas where the land contract period has expired, stabilizing and improving the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, which has been well received by the farmers.

This year, about 40% of the village groups in Hunan Province, totaling 200,000 groups, have seen their land contract periods or adjustment periods expire, requiring minor adjustments or contract renewal procedures.

The Provincial Agricultural Economy Commission made corresponding arrangements in early September. They believe that the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output is a major achievement of rural reforms and one of the policies most satisfying to the people. It still has strong vitality and should not be easily changed. Instead, stabilizing and improving the work should be considered an important task for further deepening rural reforms, which should be persistently grasped. They start from the reality that the per capita arable land in the province is only 8 mu, proposing the principle of unchanged property rights, unchanged contract relationships, and unchanged contract periods to stabilize the countryside and calm people's minds. For places where the contract period has expired, they promptly handle the contract renewal procedures.

In the improvement work, Hunan Province adheres to the principle of suitability based on local conditions, industry, and project, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach. Regardless of the form adopted, they fully respect the wishes of the people, truly letting the people choose for themselves, and do not rely on administrative measures to forcibly promote a particular model.

    让群众选择  不硬性推广
    湖南做好土地续包工作
    据新华社长沙12月15日电　（记者杨善清）湖南省在土地承包期届满的地方，及时做好土地续包工作，稳定和完善以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制，受到农民欢迎。
    今年，湖南省约有占全省村民组40％的20万个组土地承包期或调整期已届满，需要进行小调整或办理续包手续。
    省农经委在9月初就作出了相应的部署。他们认为，以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制是农村改革的重大成果，是群众最满意的政策之一，仍具有旺盛的生命力，决不能轻易改变它，而应把稳定和完善工作作为继续深化农村改革的重要任务，坚持不懈地抓好。他们从全省人均只有8分耕地的实际出发，提出了土地承包要坚持权属不变、承包关系不变、承包期不变的原则，以稳定农村，安定人心。对承包合同到期的地方及时办理续包手续。
    在完善工作中，湖南省坚持因地、因业、因项目制宜，不搞一刀切。不论采取什么形式都本着有利于发展生产力和有利于农村大局的稳定的精神充分尊重群众意愿，真正让群众自己选择，切不靠行政手段硬性推广某一种模式。
