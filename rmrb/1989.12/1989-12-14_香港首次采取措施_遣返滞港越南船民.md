Hong Kong government has for the first time taken measures to forcibly deport Vietnamese boat people. The first batch of 51 Vietnamese boat people were deported early this morning.

A Hong Kong government spokesman said, "This action to deport Vietnamese boat people is in accordance with the comprehensive plan of action agreed upon by all countries at the Geneva International Conference in June this year."

The spokesman pointed out that since 1975, a total of 170,000 Vietnamese boat people have flooded into Hong Kong. Just this year, 34,000 have arrived, and not a single person has been refused entry. All these Vietnamese have been provided with food, clothing, medical care, and shelter, which has placed a tremendous burden on Hong Kong.

Since June 16, 1988, the Hong Kong government has implemented a screening policy for incoming Vietnamese boat people. Those who are found not to be refugees have voluntarily returned to Vietnam. However, in the year and a half since the policy was implemented, only 637 people have voluntarily returned. Currently, there are more than 40,000 Vietnamese boat people stranded in Hong Kong.

Those concerned about the Vietnamese boat people issue in Hong Kong believe that the first forced deportation of Vietnamese boat people is a good start, but the most important thing is to urge the Vietnamese side to address the root causes of the boat people problem, which is the key to a positive solution.

### 香港首次采取措施  遣返滞港越南船民

    香港首次采取措施
    遣返滞港越南船民
    新华社香港12月12日电　香港政府首次对滞港越南船民采取“当然遣返”措施。第一批51名越南船民于今天凌晨遣返。
    香港政府发言人表示，“这次遣返越南船民的行动符合今年6月日内瓦国际会议上由世界各国所同意的综合行动计划内的规定。”
    这位发言人指出，自1975年以来，共有17万越南船民涌入香港，单是今年就有34000人抵港，没有任何人被拒入境。这些越南人全部得到食物、衣服、医疗照顾和栖身之所，这对香港构成很大的压力。
    香港政府从1988年6月16日开始对涌港越南船民采取甄别政策，经甄别后证明为非难民的船民自愿遣返越南。但在实施一年半的时间内，先后自愿遣返的船民总人数只有637人。而目前滞港越南船民总人数高达4万多人。
    香港关注越南船民问题的人士认为，首次当然遣返越南船民是一个好的开端，但最重要的，是要敦促越南方面根治船民问题，才是积极的解决办法。
