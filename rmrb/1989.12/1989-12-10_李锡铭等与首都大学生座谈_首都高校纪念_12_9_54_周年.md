On the afternoon of the 8th, Li Xixiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, along with other leading comrades, held a symposium at the Great Hall of the People with over 100 representatives of students and youth league cadres from more than 30 universities in the capital.

Those present at the symposium were some of the students who participated in the essay contest "Reflections After the Turmoil" organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

In his speech, Li Xixiang fully affirmed the students' reflections. He pointed out that young people should establish a communist worldview and arm themselves with Marxist thought. He hoped that the university students would put the interests of the state and the nation first, learn from their mistakes, clarify their direction, and quickly recover and move forward on the correct path.

Li Xixiang said that reform and opening up must be continued. To carry out reform and opening up well, one must adhere to the four cardinal principles.

At the meeting, nine students—Lin Tao from Beijing Normal University, Yu Luwei from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhang Aijun from Beijing Youth Political College, Bai Yang from Beijing Normal College, Mo Xuejun from Peking University, Liu Yue from Tsinghua University, Feng Zhongze from Beijing Agricultural University, Wu Baorui from Renmin University of China, and Chen Baimei from Beijing Institute of Economics—spoke in turn.

The students reflected deeply on their words and deeds during the turmoil and riots. They said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's words, "To help young people, one must be full of enthusiasm; to love young people, one must be strict with them," struck a chord with them.

In their speeches, they mentioned that through this turmoil, university students realized the inadequacies in their theoretical level and social practice experience, which need to be further studied and improved.

Li Yunchang, Han Tianshi, Yuan Mu, and Xu Weicheng attended the symposium and spoke.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 9th. (Reporter Wang Wei) Today, over 80 universities in the capital held a variety of rich and colorful cultural and sports activities to commemorate the 54th anniversary of the "December 9th" movement.

At Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and China University of Political Science and Law, "December 9th" singing competitions were held; at Renmin University of China and Beijing University of Technology, symbolic relay torch runs were organized.

    出席座谈会的，是参加共青团北京市委举办的《风波后的思考》征文活动的部分学生。
    李锡铭在讲话中充分肯定了学生们的思考。他指出，青年要树立共产主义的世界观，用马克思主义思想武装头脑。他希望大学生们要以国家、民族利益为重，总结教训，明确方向，尽快振作起来，沿着正确的道路前进。
    李锡铭说，改革开放要继续坚持。而要搞好改革开放，就必须坚持四项基本原则。
