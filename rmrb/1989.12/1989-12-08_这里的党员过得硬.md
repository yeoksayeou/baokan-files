	Party Members Here Are Steadfast

	In the new situation of reform and opening up, how to strengthen the party building within enterprises? The party committee of the Heilongjiang Province Suihua City Tobacco Company, which has been awarded the title of advanced unit by the State Tobacco Company and the provincial-level civilized unit, has launched the "Five For One Tree" activity among party members in more than ten provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and more than forty cities and counties across the country. This activity has had a good impact on establishing a positive image of party members and has achieved good results.

	The "Five For One Tree" refers to: enhancing the vitality of the branch and fully playing its role; actively doing a good job in one's own work to improve the enterprise's efficiency; creating a good environment for the manager's decision-making; ensuring supervision and performing duties and obligations; and correcting party style and being selflessly dedicated to public service.

	The company party committee first encourages party members to actively participate in the democratic appraisal of the leading cadre team twice a year. Since 1988, the 110 party members of the entire company have proposed 31 suggestions for improvement in aspects such as the leadership style, work methods, task execution, and strict organizational life of the grassroots branch leadership, enhancing the planning and scientific nature of the branch work. Secondly, the company attaches importance to holding a democratic life meeting for party members every quarter. Through democratic life meetings, party members carry out mutual criticism and supervision, and timely help those whose model role is not prominent to improve their awareness and better play their pioneering and exemplary role.

	In addition, the party committee also mobilizes party members to actively participate in the reform of the activities and methods of the party branch. The six branches under the company party committee have opened various theoretical study classes, revolutionary tradition education, calligraphy, painting, and essay competitions, and held a hundred-question intelligence competition on the basic knowledge of the party and spiritual civilization construction. On July 1, 1989, in conjunction with the celebration of the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the party committee held a large-scale "Celebrating the 71st Anniversary of the Party" speech, singing, and entertainment party. Through these activities, the revolutionary enthusiasm of party members is aroused, and the revolutionary sentiment of party members is cultivated.

	The party committee of the tobacco company attaches importance to letting party members take the lead and be the backbone in the production line. 72% of the party members in the entire company work on the production line and key positions. Young party member Zhao Shenghai is in charge of tobacco production. Although he lives in the city, in order to develop tobacco production, he spends the whole year in the countryside. During the busy farming season, he often does not return home for more than a month. When his child at home fell seriously ill, his wife called him three times a day in an emergency. He rushed back home in the evening, and the next day he left his wife and sick child with tears on their faces and hurried back to the countryside.

	The tobacco company holds the power to grade and wholesale high-quality cigarettes. To prevent the occurrence of improper practices such as using power for personal gain and using tobacco for profit, the party committee of the tobacco company has formulated 18 regulations for internal clean governance, requiring each party member to strictly abide by them.

	Communist Party member Feng Shushan is the purchasing officer of the Yong'an Town Tobacco Station. Since 1983, he has purchased more than 3 million pounds of tobacco leaves, with a qualification rate of 100%. Over the years, he has rejected bribes including watches, bicycles, and red envelopes totaling more than 4,000 yuan. In recent years, no party member in the entire company has been found to have violated discipline.

	In the Suihua City Tobacco Company, almost every party member has a record of achievements. The employees of this company say: "The party members in our company are all steadfast and each one is outstanding."

    这里的党员过得硬
    陈万林　苗悦晨　周平
    在改革开放的新形势下，如何抓好企业党的建设？获得国家烟草公司先进单位和省级精神文明单位称号的黑龙江省绥化市烟草公司党委，在党员中开展的“五为一树”活动在全国十几个省、市、自治区的四十多个市县产生了良好的影响，为树立党员的正面形象，收到了较好的效果。
    “五为一树”即：为支部增强活力充分发挥作用；为企业提高效益积极做好本职工作；为经理决策创造良好环境；为搞好保证监督履行权利和义务；为端正党风、自觉廉洁奉公。
    公司党委首先让党员积极参加一年两次的民主评议领导班子活动。1988年以来，全公司110名党员，为基层支部班子提出领导作风、工作方法、执行任务、严格组织生活等方面的31条批评改进意见，增强了支部工作的计划性、科学性。其次，公司注重开好每季一次的党员民主生活会。通过民主生活会，使党员互相开展批评，互相监督，对模范作用不突出的党员及时进行帮助，使之提高认识，更好地发挥先锋模范作用。
    除此而外，党委还动员党员积极参与党支部活动方式、方法的改革。公司党委所属6个支部，根据各支部的特点开办各种理论学习班，革命传统教育，举办书法、绘画、征文比赛，举办党的基础知识、精神文明建设百题智力竞赛，1989年“七一”，结合庆祝平息北京反革命暴乱，党委举办了大型的“庆七一歌颂党”的演讲、演唱联欢会。通过这些活动激发党员的革命激情、陶冶党员的革命情操。
    烟草公司党委注重让党员在生产一线挑大梁、当骨干。全公司在生产一线和关键岗位工作的党员占总数的72％。年轻党员赵生海负责烤烟生产，他家住城里，为了发展烟草生产，一年四季蹲在乡下，农忙时常常一个多月不回家。家里孩子得了重病，爱人一天3次电话告急，他晚上赶回家，第二天便离开满面泪水的妻子和病儿，急速返回乡下。
    烟草公司掌握着收购烤烟等级、批发名优卷烟的权力，为防止出现以权谋私、以烟谋利的行业不正之风，烟草公司党委制定了企业内部的廉政建设规定共18条，要求每个党员严格遵守。
    共产党员丰树山是永安镇烟叶站的收购员，从1983年以来，共收购烟叶300多万斤，合格率达100％。几年来，他拒收手表、自行车、小红包等贿赂折合人民币4000余元。这些年来，全公司党员没有一名违纪的。
    在绥化市烟草公司，几乎每个党员都有一本业绩帐。这个公司的职工说：“我们公司的党员人人过得硬，个个叫得响。”
