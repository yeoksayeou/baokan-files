    A large lighthouse has been completed on the mainland side of the Taiwan Strait, marking the end of an era without major navigational aids in the Fujian coastal waters. Recently, a large lighthouse designed and constructed by China's Maritime Safety Administration was completed at the southern tip of Xiamen Harbor, at Zhonghai Cape, and will officially begin operating on December 25, providing guidance to domestic and international vessels.

    The lighthouse stands 18.2 meters tall, with a range of 25 nautical miles. At night, it emits a strong white light beam, flashing twice every 6.2 seconds.
