Today, the first group of foreign friends came to participate in volunteer labor at the Northern Suburbs Sports Center for the 11th Asian Games. A delegation of fifty people from the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, led by Ambassador Zhu Changjun, came to the Northern Suburbs Athletics Stadium to participate in volunteer labor. Before the labor, the Korean guests first went to the Northern Suburbs Asian Games Village Service Center to listen to an introduction about the engineering aspects and visited the athletes' village construction site.

Ambassador Zhu Changjun wrote in the guest book: "Sincerely wishing the 11th Asian Games, held in the capital of our closest friendly neighbor, the People's Republic of China, Beijing, to open successfully and be a complete success." After the labor, Ambassador Zhu said, "The Asian Games being held in China is not only a source of pride for China but also a source of pride for Asia."
