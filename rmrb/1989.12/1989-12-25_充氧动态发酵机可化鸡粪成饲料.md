    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 23rd.

    The East Sea Feed Experimental Factory, affiliated with the Dongjiao Agricultural and Pastoral Farm in Tianjin, has developed an "oxygen-enriched dynamic fermentation machine" after six years of arduous research. This machine can convert chicken manure, which is low-cost, widely available, and contains 28% crude protein, into odorless and sterile feed within ten hours. This feed can replace 40% to 50% of full-price feed, but the weight gain and market rate of pigs fed with this feed are the same as those fed with full-price feed. Currently, this oxygen-enriched dynamic fermentation machine has obtained a national patent and won a silver medal at the Beijing International Invention Exhibition.

    充氧动态发酵机可化鸡粪成饲料
    本报天津十二月二十三日电　记者肖荻报道：天津东郊农牧场所属东海饲料试验厂经六年艰辛研究，发明了“充氧动态发酵机”，利用这种发酵机十小时内可将成本低、来源广、粗蛋白含量达百分之二十八的鸡粪，转化成无味、无菌的饲料。它能代替全价饲料百分之四十至百分之五十，但猪的增肉率、出栏率与喂全价饲料相同。目前，这种充氧动态发酵机已获国家专利权，在北京国际发明展览会上获银质奖。
