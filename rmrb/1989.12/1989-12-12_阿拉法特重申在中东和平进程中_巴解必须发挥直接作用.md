Arafat, the President of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, reiterated today in an interview with a reporter from the American National Broadcasting Company that the PLO must play a direct role in the Middle East peace process.

Arafat said that the Palestinian people and their leadership have the right to appoint their own representatives, and that no one other than the Palestinians themselves has the right to speak on behalf of the Palestinians. Regarding the upcoming three-way meeting between the foreign ministers of Egypt, Israel, and the U.S. Secretary of State in Washington, he said that the Palestinian side has no connection with this meeting.

While acknowledging the positive effects of the past year's dialogue between the PLO and the U.S., Arafat also accused the U.S. of ignoring the Palestinian people and their leadership.

Arafat emphasized that the Palestinian people are willing to live in peace with all their neighbors, including Israel.

    阿拉法特重申在中东和平进程中
    巴解必须发挥直接作用
    新华社突尼斯12月10日电  据突尼斯非洲通讯社报道，巴勒斯坦国总统、巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特今天在向美国全国广播公司电视台记者发表谈话时重申，巴解组织必须在中东和平进程中发挥直接的作用。
    阿拉法特说，巴勒斯坦人及其领导机构有权指定自己的代表，除巴勒斯坦人自己外，任何人都无权代表巴勒斯坦人发表意见。他在谈到埃及、以色列外长和美国国务卿即将在华盛顿举行的三方会晤时说，巴勒斯坦方面同这次会晤毫无联系。
    阿拉法特在肯定一年来巴美对话的积极效果的同时，还指责美国无视巴勒斯坦人民及其领导机构。
    阿拉法特强调，巴勒斯坦人民愿意同包括以色列在内的所有邻国和平共处。
