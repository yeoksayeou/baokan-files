    Since last year, the trend of extravagant spending and gift-giving has spread to the mountainous areas of Gan Yu. The public has expressed strong dissatisfaction with this. In April of this year, the Party Committee and the government of Heilin Township in our county conducted a financial audit of 26 villages and discovered that some village committees had severely mismanaged public funds for non-productive expenses such as banquets and gifts. Last year alone, over 100,000 yuan was spent on banquets and gifts, accounting for 17% of the total village income.

    Starting in May, the township established five specific regulations. It was stipulated that township departments working in rural areas must not eat in the villages; visitors from higher authorities must be accommodated by the township according to prescribed standards. The township also implemented a "dual audit" system for village finances, where on the 27th of each month, the township audits the receipts and expenditures of each village. Only expenditures that comply with financial regulations are approved and recorded; otherwise, no expenditures are allowed. On the 6th of each month, the township's management station conducts a comprehensive audit of each village's account books and forms, addressing any issues promptly. These regulations, implemented for three months, have resulted in a reduction of over 30,000 yuan in village-level entertainment expenses compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 92.2%.

    黑林乡严格财务审查
    自前年以来，社会上的吃喝风刮到了赣榆山区，群众对此意见很大。今年4月，我县黑林乡党委、乡政府通过对26个村财务帐目清查发现，一些村队用公款吃喝送礼等非生产性开支严重失控。仅去年一年，用于吃喝送礼的就达10多万元，占村级总收入的17％。
    从5月份开始，这个乡制定了5项具体规定，要求乡直机关各部门到农村工作，一律不准在村里吃饭；上级来人，由乡里按规定标准统一安排。并对村级财务实行定时“双审计”，即每月27日全乡分别对各村收支单据进行审核，对符合财务制度的给予盖章入账，否则不准开支。每月6日，由乡经营管理站对各村账册表单进行一次全面审核，发现问题立即处理。这些规定制定3个月以来，全乡村级招待费就比去年同期减少了3万余元，下降了92.2％。
