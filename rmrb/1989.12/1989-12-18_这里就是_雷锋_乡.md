The Beijing Military Region Air Force Meteorological Service Station, stationed by the Dragon Lake in Beijing, has been awarded the title of "Advanced Unit in Spiritual Civilization Construction" by the Beijing Municipal Government for 10 consecutive years. It has been named an "Advanced Unit in Learning from Lei Feng" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and a "National Double Support Advanced Unit" by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Political Department. Local residents point to the station and say, "This is where Lei Feng is!"

One December 8th, a middle school student fell into an ice hole in Dragon Lake. While hundreds of people on the shore stood by watching a life in peril, Political Instructor Zhang Fuge from the Air Force Command Meteorological Service Station led several soldiers to the scene. Ignoring some people's cold mockery, they broke the ice and entered the water, saving the student. On November 1, 1988, a woman fell into the moat near Dragon Lake. At that time, dozens of onlookers on the shore were watching the spectacle. Some of them said, "Where are the soldiers?" Specialist Sergeant Fang Feng, who was passing by on a bicycle, heard that someone had fallen into the water and immediately rushed to the riverbank. He dove into the icy, muddy water and, after struggling, pulled the unconscious woman to safety. He left without even leaving his name.

The two heroes who saved lives at Dragon Lake are both from the Meteorological Service Station. Is this a coincidence? No! For 20 years, the station's soldiers have never stopped learning from Comrade Lei Feng. Therefore, the moving deeds they have created in spiritual civilization construction follow one after another. From 1979 to the present, they have saved 5 young lives!

When saving people, they are fearless; when dealing with emergencies, they are the first to act. When a research institute's family building caught fire, more than 30 soldiers from the station rushed into the thick smoke time and time again, carrying out infants and the elderly, and rescuing residents' valuable belongings from the danger zone.

Another time, a company's temporary building caught fire, and the flames spread rapidly with the help of a strong northwest wind, seriously threatening the nearby workers' dormitories. Thirty soldiers from the Meteorological Service Station rushed to the scene and fought the fire for more than two hours, finally extinguishing the blaze and saving tens of thousands of yuan worth of property.

The soldiers of the Air Force Meteorological Service Station are so enthusiastic towards the people, while they are unyielding towards lawbreakers and troublemakers. Two thugs wielding steel forks threatened a couple in Dragon Lake Park. Technician Li Zhenlai, unarmed, stepped forward to reprimand them and, with the help of the crowd, handed the thugs over to the public security authorities. Soldier Xie Yuexiang stood up in the suburbs of Beijing and stopped a few hooligans from harassing a young girl. Such acts of bravery are common in the Meteorological Service Station. Therefore, in the past 10 years, this small unit of about a hundred people has had 23 instances of meritorious service and 230 instances of commendation.

In building socialist spiritual civilization, the soldiers of the station have also had their share of confusion. Some of them have asked: In the context of a commodity economy, is it still necessary to carry out the "Learn from Lei Feng, Do Good Deeds" activity? However, the good deeds they have done always receive praise from the people, making the entire station's soldiers see the social value of their spiritual civilization behavior. Some soldiers say: Carrying out reform and opening up, updating concepts, the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation and the fine traditions of the army can only be carried forward. Therefore, they, like Lei Feng of old, often step out of the barracks and into society to do good deeds for the people and contribute to the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Their "Youth Civilization Service Team" often appears on the streets, repairing bicycles, clocks, and household appliances for the local residents, providing free haircuts, sewing, and shoe repairs, and offering computer and meteorological knowledge consultations.

They actively carry out joint construction activities with several primary and secondary schools, sending more than 100 tutors to guide students' studies, tell heroic stories, and assist schools in transforming the ideology of backward students.

In a courtyard in You'anmen East, three elderly people over 70 live alone, with no children, and their later lives are very inconvenient. After learning of this, the soldiers of the station decided to take care of the three elderly people. The soldiers insist on visiting the elderly every week to carry water, sweep the floor, buy coal and grain, take the elderly out for sightseeing, help them change windows, store cabbages, install stoves, and spend festivals with them. On the elderly's birthdays, the soldiers send them cakes, longevity noodles, and new clothes. When the elderly are sick, the soldiers find doctors and send medicine, asking about their health. Ten years have passed, and the soldiers of the station have changed generation after generation, but the care for the elderly has never stopped. The elderly are very moved and praise the soldiers as Lei Fengs whenever they meet someone.

### 这里就是“雷锋”乡

    救人有他们，扑火有他们，打击违法犯罪分子仍然有他们，附近的群众说——
    这里就是“雷锋”乡
    蔡建文　钱友荣　曾宝瑜
    驻扎在北京市龙潭湖畔的北京军区空军司令部气象勤务站，连续10年被北京市人民政府授予“精神文明建设先进单位”，被共青团中央授予“学雷锋先进单位”，被民政部、总政治部授予“全国双拥先进单位”。附近的群众指着勤务站说：“这里就是雷锋多！”
    有一年12月8日，一名中学生落入龙潭湖冰窟中。当岸上数百人袖手围观一个岌岌可危的生命的时候，北空司令部气象勤务站教导员张福阁带领曹怀良等几名战士跑向现场，不顾一些人的冷嘲热讽，破冰入水，把那位学生救上岸来。1988年11月1日，一名妇女落入龙潭湖畔的护城河中。此时岸上看热闹者有数十人。他们中有的说“怎么不见当兵的？”骑车路过的气象勤务站专业军士方风前听说有人落水，立即赶到河边，纵身扎进冰冷刺骨的河中，踏淤泥、搏污水，将那位神志不清的妇女救上了岸，连名字也没留下就悄悄走开了。
    龙潭湖两次救人的勇士同是勤务站的官兵，这难道是巧合吗？不是！20年来，勤务站官兵们开展向雷锋同志学习的活动从未间断过，因此，他们在精神文明建设中创造的动人事迹，一桩接着一桩。1979年至今，他们共抢救了5个年轻的生命！
    救人，他们奋不顾身；抢险，他们一马当先。某研究所家属楼发生火灾，勤务站30多名官兵冒着呛人的浓烟，一次又一次冲进火海，把幼儿和老人背出楼外，把居民的贵重物品抢运出险区。
    又一次，某公司活动板房不慎失火，火舌借着6级西北风蔓延，严重威胁着邻近的职工宿舍。气象勤务站的30名官兵急奔现场，与火龙烟浪搏斗了两个多小时，终于将大火扑灭，保住了价值几十万元的财产。
    北空气象勤务站的官兵们对人民是这样热忱，而对违法乱纪分子却是不留情面。两名歹徒手持钢叉在龙潭湖公园威胁一对情侣，技师李振来赤手空拳上前训斥，并且在群众的协助下，将歹徒扭送公安机关。战士谢月祥在京郊挺身而出，制止了几个流氓调戏一名少女的丑恶行径。这样见义勇为的事，在气象勤务站还有许多。正因为如此，10年间，这个才有百来人的基层单位，立功23人次，获嘉奖230人次。
    在建设社会主义精神文明中，勤务站的官兵们也曾有过困惑。他们中曾有人问：在商品经济形势下，开展“学雷锋做好事”活动还有无必要？但是，他们所做的一件件好事，总是受到人民群众的褒奖，使勤务站的全体官兵看到了自己精神文明行为的社会价值。有的战士说：进行改革开放，观念更新，中华民族的传统美德和军队的优良传统只能发扬光大。于是他们像当年的雷锋一样，经常步出军营，走向社会，为人民做好事，为建设社会主义精神文明作贡献。他们组成的“青年文明服务队”经常出现在街头，为驻地群众修自行车、钟表、家用电器，义务理发、缝纫、补鞋，提供计算机和气象知识咨询等。
    他们积极与几所中小学开展共建活动，先后派出辅导员100多名，辅导学生学习，宣讲英雄故事，协助学校做好后进学生思想转化工作。
    右安门东里的一个四合院里，住着3位年过古稀的老人，无子无女，晚年生活十分不便。勤务站的官兵得知此情后，决定把3位孤寡老人的生活照料包揽下来。战士们坚持每周登门为老人挑水扫地，买煤买粮，领老人游览、帮老人换纱窗、贮存大白菜，为老人安炉具，和老人共度佳节。老人过生日，战士们送去蛋糕、长寿面、新衣服，老人病了，战士们为之寻医送药，问寒问暖。10年过去了，勤务站的官兵换了一茬又一茬，照料老人生活却从未间断过。老人很受感动，逢人便夸战士们个个是雷锋。
