	It is often seen in the newspapers that upright officials reject bribes, which is very instructive. However, many comrades merely reject bribes and only achieve "self-discipline," which is far from enough.

	Accepting bribes requires someone to offer them. Accepting bribes and offering bribes are interdependent and cause each other. To eradicate corruption, it goes without saying that those who accept bribes must be severely punished, but those who offer bribes must also be punished without leniency. Otherwise, cutting off the flow while leaving the source, the harm will still find ways to spread and flood again, making the fight against corruption like cutting water with a knife.

	Those who offer bribes generally fall into two categories: one is those who, under the pressure of corrupt officials, curry favor to avoid disasters and misfortunes. These people often tighten their belts and give more than they can afford, which is truly pitiful. The other type uses bribes as bait to lure officials into disregarding laws and regulations, engaging in "power-for-money" exchanges. Some people use bribes to obtain special permits for scarce goods, high-ranking positions, extensive networks, and various titles such as "expert" or "master." In Yizheng City, Jiangsu Province, a 25-year-old farmer, Chen Zongming, used 80,000 yuan in bribes to obtain 2.95 million yuan in illegal loans. The sales department of Zhongxing Electrical Products used 2,000 yuan in bribes to bribe the former deputy director of the original Shenyang Non-Ferrous Metal Processing Plant, Zhao Boyu, thereby purchasing 100 tons of aluminum ingots and 50 tons of electrolytic copper, making illegal profits of over 100,000 yuan after reselling. They use bribes as a means to corrupt officials, open channels, seek wealth, and even commit crimes, which is extremely despicable. Such people must be punished by law to serve as a deterrent. Those who offer bribes out of desperation must also be made to understand that offering bribes is an illegal and disorderly act.

	Some people believe that pursuing those who offer bribes will affect the public's enthusiasm for reporting, making it difficult to uncover the truth about those who accept bribes. I do not agree with this view. If party discipline and state laws are so lenient, not only will they fail to punish evil, but they will also fail to promote good. For example, according to reports, the Dalian Aquatic Pharmaceutical Factory "paid 2.4 million yuan in 'goodwill fees' in one year," resulting in the relevant authorities only "dealing with" the serious tax evasion caused by this, and ignoring the rest. How was this "2.4 million yuan" "paid"? It was nothing but bribery. If such cases are not dealt with according to law, people may mistakenly believe that offering bribes is not a crime. Where is the authority of the law? When will the wind of bribery be stopped? On the contrary, if gifts and bribes are severely investigated and dealt with, not only will it not affect the uncovering of the truth about those who accept bribes, but it will also help in dealing with those who accept bribes. For example, in Yulong County, Yunnan Province, an individual businessman used bribes to engage in illegal activities and amassed tens of millions of yuan in assets over three years. By investigating his crime of offering bribes, 34 provincial, municipal, and county state officials who accepted bribes were quickly uncovered.

	It can be seen that offering bribes and accepting bribes are like vines and melons, connected and interdependent. Following the vine to find the melon, and following the melon to find the vine, often results in uprooting the radish with the mud. It is unwise to abandon the vine and not follow the melon.

    何不顺藤摸瓜？
    李庚辰
    常从报上读到廉洁奉公的干部拒贿的事迹，很受教益。但是，许多同志一拒了之，仅仅做到了“慎独”，是很不够的。
    受贿，需要有人行贿。受贿与行贿，互相依存，互为因果。要根除贿赂，严惩受贿者自不待言，对行贿者也决不可宽贷。否则，断其流而存其源，其祸水还要无孔不入而再行泛滥，惩治腐败就将如抽刀断水。
    行贿者大抵有两种：一是迫于贪官淫威而曲意逢迎以图祛灾免祸的。这种人往往节衣缩食，捐不足奉有余，确实可怜。二是以贿赂做饵，诱掌权者不顾法纪，搞“权钱交易”。有的人行贿搞到了买紧俏货物的专批条子、飞黄腾达的乌纱帽子、四通八达的关系网子，以及什么“能人”什么“家”的桂冠。江苏仪征市一个25岁的农民陈宗明，用8万元贿金换来了295万元的巨额非法贷款；中兴机电产品销售部用2000元贿金买通原沈阳有色金属加工厂副厂长赵伯禹，从而套购到铝锭100吨、电解铜50吨，倒卖后非法获利10万多元。他们将行贿当成了腐蚀干部、打通关节、图财谋位以至违法犯罪的手段，十分可恶。对这种人只能绳之以法才能以儆效尤，对前面那种人也必须让他们知道行贿是违法乱纪行为。
    有些人认为，追究行贿者，会影响群众的举报积极性，不利于弄清受贿人的问题。我对此说法不以为然。党纪国法若如此网开一面，不但不能惩恶，而且不能扬善。例如，据报载，大连水产制药厂“一年送‘好处费’24万元”，结果有关方面只是“查处”了由此造成的“严重漏税行为”，余皆不问。这“24万元”怎么“送”的？无非贿赂而已。诸如此类如不依法论处，会使人误以为行贿无罪。法律威严何在？贿风何时能煞？相反，对送礼和行贿行为，严厉查处，不仅不会影响弄清受贿人的问题，而且会有助于查处受赌者。例如，云南陆良县有个个体户靠贿赂干部搞不法活动，三年拥有数十万元资产。由于审查了他的行贿罪，便很快弄清了34名省、地、县国家工作人员的受贿罪。
    可见，行贿与受贿，也是瓜连藤，藤连瓜，顺藤摸瓜，顺瓜摸藤，往往拔出萝卜带出泥。弃藤不摸瓜才是不智之举。
