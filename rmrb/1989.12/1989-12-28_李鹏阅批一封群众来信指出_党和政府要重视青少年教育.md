A letter from the public urging society to pay more attention to education and rescue backward youth has connected Premier Li Peng of the State Council with 87-year-old ordinary citizen Zhang Mulian.

Zhang Mulian is a retired cadre from the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works. In recent years, despite his advanced age and frail health, he has conducted surveys on youth education issues in Tangshan, Hebei, and Shihezi, Xinjiang, at his own expense. In early December, he wrote to Premier Li Peng, reporting that more and more students are becoming indifferent to or dropping out of school. Some schools often adopt the approach of pushing out students with poor academic performance and poor conduct, and relevant departments have not paid sufficient attention to this phenomenon, causing great trouble for parents. He suggested launching a nationwide campaign to educate and rescue backward youth. Schools should warmly care for students with poor academic performance and poor conduct, helping them to transform. Neighborhood committees, police stations, and schools should share information to form a monitoring network for backward students.

On December 8, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council forwarded a summary of this letter from the public to Premier Li Peng. The next day, Premier Li Peng wrote the following message to Tangshan Mayor Chen Liyou on the letter: "The education of youth is a major issue concerning the cultivation of successors. Both the Party and the government should pay attention to and care for it. The letter from Comrade Zhang Mulian of Tangshan is very sincere. His suggestions on rescuing and helping backward youth are good. Please study which ones can be adopted. Tangshan is a new city and should set a new trend."

After learning of this information, Tangshan Municipal Party Secretary Liu Shanyang and Mayor Chen Liyou immediately convened a meeting to study and implement measures, and held a discussion with Comrade Zhang Mulian, introducing the city's arrangements for launching the campaign to learn from Lei Feng, set new trends, and improve the overall social atmosphere, mobilizing the public security, judicial, school, and neighborhood committees to work closely together to educate backward youth.

Recently, reporters interviewed the white-haired Zhang Mulian. He raised four fingers and, with a trembling voice, said: "I have experienced the Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang Government, the Kuomintang Government, and the socialist society led by the Communist Party. I can be considered a 'four-dynasty veteran.' I didn't expect that my ordinary letter would receive such attention from Premier Li Peng. This shows that the Party and the government are connected with the people. As long as the Party and the government maintain close contact with the people, the country will have great hope!"

    李鹏阅批一封群众来信指出
    党和政府要重视青少年教育
    新华社唐山12月27日电　（记者江山、郑战国）一封呼吁全社会都来重视教育、挽救落后青少年的群众来信，把国务院总理李鹏和87岁的普通市民张慕良的心连在了一起。
    张慕良是唐山机车车辆工厂的退休干部，近年来，他不顾年迈体弱，自费在河北唐山、新疆石河子等地调查青少年的教育问题。12月初，他投书李鹏总理，反映当前青少年怠学、弃学越来越多的情况。对成绩不好、品德不良的学生，有些学校往往采取推出门去的办法，有关部门对这种现象没有引起应有的重视。这就苦了家长。他建议在全国开展教育、挽救落后青少年的工作。学校要热情关心学习差、品德差的学生，帮助其转化。街道、派出所、学校要互通情况，形成对落后学生的监测网。
    12月8日，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅信访局将这封群众来信，摘要转送李鹏总理。第二天，李鹏总理就在这封信上给唐山市长陈立友写下了这样一段话：“对青少年的教育是关系到培养什么样的接班人的大事，党和政府都应予以重视和关怀。你市张慕良老人来信非常恳切，他对挽救、帮助落后青少年的建议是好的，请你们研究一下哪些可以采纳。唐山是一个新兴城市，应树立起一股新风。”
    唐山市委书记刘善祥、市长陈立友得知这一信息后，立即召开会议，研究落实措施，并与张慕良老人进行了座谈，向他介绍了市里关于开展学雷锋、树新风，促使整个社会风气好转，动员公安、司法、学校、街道等有关部门密切配合，教育落后青少年的情况和安排。
    日前，记者采访了白发苍苍的张慕良老人。他伸出了四根手指，带着颤抖的声音说：“我经历了满清政府、北洋军阀政府、国民党政府和共产党领导的社会主义，也算作‘四朝元老’了。没想到，我的一封普通信件，会引起李鹏总理这样重视，这说明，党和政府同人民群众是连在一起的。只要党和政府同群众保持着密切的联系，国家就大有希望！”
