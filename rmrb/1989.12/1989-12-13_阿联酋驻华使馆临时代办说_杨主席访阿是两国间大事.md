    阿联酋驻华使馆临时代办说
    杨主席访阿是两国间大事
    新华社北京12月12日电  （记者宋秉衡　邢旭东）阿拉伯联合酋长国驻华使馆临时代办艾哈迈德·侯萨尼日前在这里说，中国国家主席杨尚昆即将对阿联酋进行的正式友好访问，是阿中关系史上的历史性事件，阿联酋十分重视这次访问。
    在杨尚昆主席出访埃及、阿联酋、科威特和阿曼苏丹国前夕，本社记者采访了艾哈迈德·侯萨尼代办。他说，海湾国家同中国之间的友好关系在不断发展，杨尚昆主席对阿联酋等海湾国家的首次访问，无疑将把中国与这些国家在各个领域的关系推向一个新的水平。他说，中国是一个大国，又是联合国安理会常任理事国，在维护世界的和平与稳定中发挥着重要作用，所以杨主席的访问也是国际关系中的一件大事。
    艾哈迈德·侯萨尼回顾了阿联酋和中国关系的发展。他说，和平共处五项原则是阿中两国1984年建交的基础，此外，两国间还存在着许多共同点，那就是两国人民都在坚持国家统一、领土主权和反对分裂。
    他指出，两国间的经济合作和贸易交往近年发展很快。1985年两国政府签署经济、贸易和技术合作协议以后，双边贸易额由1986年的1.48亿美元，上升到1988年的3.19亿美元。根据两国有关部门达成的协议，今年阿联酋将从中国陕西省进口250辆卡车，价值550万美元。目前，有28家中国公司在阿联酋开展承包业务，深受阿联酋人民的支持和欢迎，最近几年，它们共获得合同总金额为7000万美元的承包项目。他还说，两国间混合委员会最近在阿布扎比召开了第二次会议，讨论了扩大双边经济合作和贸易往来的可能性，因此，明年的双边贸易将会有更大的发展。他最后说，杨主席对阿联酋的访问，必将为阿中两国今后在各个领域的合作开辟广阔的前景，并使这一合作更加富有成果。
