    The Bulgarian National Assembly issued a statement on the evening of December 14, emphasizing that it will not allow the country to be plunged into chaos and national tragedy.

    The statement pointed out that certain spontaneous organizations organized tens of thousands of young people in the afternoon of the 14th to engage in anti-socialist and anti-constitutional activities, provoking the highest state power organ, gathering and demonstrating in front of the National Assembly, disrupting the normal work of the Assembly. These activities "exceeded the limits allowed by any democratic and law-abiding country." The National Assembly suspended its agenda and passed this statement through discussion. The statement called on citizens of Sofia to resolutely resist such activities.

    保议会强调不准制造动乱
    新华社索非亚12月14日电　保加利亚国民议会14日晚发表声明强调指出，国民议会绝不允许把国家推向混乱和民族悲剧。
    声明指出，某些自发组织14日下午组织上万名青年搞反对社会主义和反对宪法的活动，对国家最高权力机关进行挑衅，在国民议会门口集会示威，干扰议会的正常工作，这些活动“超出了任何一个民主和法治国家所允许的界限”。国民议会中断议程和讨论通过了这一声明。声明中号召索非亚公民对这种活动进行坚决反击。
