In the last 20 days of the 1980s, nearly 60 corps, army, and division-level party committee secretaries from units under the General Staff Department gathered in a secluded valley in the western suburbs of Beijing. The General Staff Department held its first-ever party committee secretary training class here.

After the political turmoil of the spring and summer of 1989, the complex environment and fierce struggles sounded an alarm for us: the party must be strengthened, and it cannot be delayed any longer. Reflecting on the past, every Communist Party member, especially mid-to-high-level cadres, felt a deep sense of urgency.

In the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, various levels of party organizations, while clearing their minds and summarizing experiences and lessons, almost all mentioned that "fortresses are most easily breached from within." If we do not strengthen the party, it may disintegrate from within, destroying our own defenses, which is the most frightening scenario. The construction of the ruling party is related to the life and death of the party. In the past, party building was one of our "three magic weapons" to defeat the enemy. Today, we must still wield this primary weapon.

After careful consideration, the General Staff Department Party Committee decided to hold the first party committee secretary training class, focusing on the major issue of maintaining the party's absolute leadership over the military.

The specific organizing department was busy preparing for the training class, facing two major challenges: first, it was the end of the year, and military tasks were heavy. Could so many high-ranking officers from above-division units be gathered to attend the training class? Second, in terms of course arrangements, who would teach and how would they teach?

The results were surprising.

Nearly 60 party committee secretaries from academies and research institutes across the country arrived in Beijing on time as notified. Among them were political commissars and military commanders, all busy with their work. However, as party committee secretaries, they were more aware that their primary responsibility was to strengthen party building. Some comrades said, "Such opportunities to attend the class are rare; no matter how busy the work is, one must go." Some comrades had already filled their pre-New Year schedules with 11 meetings, but after receiving the notice to attend the training class, they promptly made arrangements and still arrived on time. Many generals living in Beijing did not return home after coming to the training class; they dove into the research topics, listening to lectures and discussing during the day, reading materials and taking notes at night, exchanging ideas, and exploring "difficulties" together.

Members of the General Staff Department Party Committee took on all the teaching tasks. The General Staff Department leaders said, "We should study together with everyone; no matter how busy we are, we must go." General Staff Department Chief of Staff Xie Haodong rushed back from an out-of-town trip to Beijing and immediately went to the training class to discuss with everyone, explore issues, and research lecture outlines. Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Xin, Xu Huizhi, and Political Department Director Zhao Cong also participated in the research and teaching.

Party building is complex and multifaceted; what should we focus on?

Based on extensive investigations and tracking observations, the training class proposed to focus on "one main line and three links."

The construction of the military party has special significance and higher standards. Party building must be strengthened from the perspective of the party's absolute leadership over the military, and party building must ensure the party's absolute leadership over the military. Around this main line, three links must be focused on: party committee leadership, cadre team building, and being a good secretary. In this way, party committee building and work can consciously adapt to objective laws. Everyone felt that these three links deepened the research theme of how to ensure the party's absolute leadership over the military from three different angles. Many comrades expressed, "When we return, we will follow this path."

    贵在“聚精会神”
    ——总参第一期党委书记研究班侧记
    贺江波　陈代平
    在20世纪80年代的最后20天，北京西郊偏僻的山坳里，聚集着来自总参谋部所属单位的近60名兵团、军、师三级党委书记。总参历史上第一期党委书记研究班在这里举办。
    经过1989年春夏之交的政治风波之后，复杂的环境，严酷的斗争，向我们敲起了警钟：这个党该抓了，不抓不行了。痛定思痛，每个共产党员特别是党的中高级干部都有这样的切肤之感。
    在人民解放军总参谋部，各级党组织在清理思想、总结经验教训时，几乎都谈到，“堡垒最容易从内部攻破”。如果我们党的建设抓不好，就可能自我涣散，自毁长城，这是最可怕的。执政党自身建设关系到党的生死存亡。党的建设过去是我们战胜敌人的“三大法宝”之一，今天，我们仍然要拿起这个最主要的法宝。
    总参党委经过深思熟虑，决定开办总参第一期党委书记研究班，专题研究坚持党对军队的绝对领导这一重大课题。
    具体承办部门正在紧张筹备研究班，两大难题摆在面前：一是眼下正值年终岁首，部队工作任务繁重，召集这么多师以上单位主官来参加研究班，能不能落实？二是在课程安排上，谁来讲课，怎么讲？
    结果出人意料。
    接到通知的近60个院校和科研单位的党委书记，如期从全国各地聚集到北京。他们中，有政治委员，也有军事主官，处在繁忙的工作岗位上。然而，作为党委书记，他们更意识到第一位的责任是抓党建。有的同志说：“参加这样的班机会难得，工作再忙也得去。”有的同志年前日程表已排满11个会议，接到参加研究班的通知后，立即妥善安排，仍然按时赶来参加。不少家在北京的将军，来到研究班不回家，一头钻进研究课题之中，白天听课、讨论，晚上阅读材料，整理笔记，互相切磋，共探“难题”。
    总参党委成员承担了全部授课任务。总参领导说：“我们应该和大家一起研究，再忙也得去。”总参谋长迟浩田刚从外地出差回京，就赶到研究班与大家座谈，探讨问题，研究讲课提纲。副总参谋长徐信、徐惠滋、总参政治部主任赵丛等都参加研究并讲课。
    党委建设千头万绪，抓什么？
    在广泛调查研究和跟踪考察的基础上，研究班提出要抓住“一条主线三个环节”。
    军队党的建设有着特殊的意义和更高的标准。要从坚持党对军队绝对领导的高度抓党建，党的建设又要确保党对军队的绝对领导。围绕这条主线，要抓住三个环节，即：党委领导，班子建设，当好书记。这样，就能自觉地适应党委建设和工作的客观规律。大家感到，这三个环节从三个不同角度深化了如何保证党对军队绝对领导这一研究主题。不少同志表示，“我们回去后，就按这个路子抓。”
