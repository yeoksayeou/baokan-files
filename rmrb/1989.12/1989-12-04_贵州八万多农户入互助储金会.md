Over the past two years, Guizhou Province has established 561 rural mutual aid savings associations. More than 84,000 households have joined, raising 2.28 million yuan and 2.3 million kilograms of grain. These associations have played an active role in promoting agricultural production and solving the difficulties faced by farmers in their production and daily lives, and have been well received by the farmers.

In the past two years, the mutual aid savings associations have lent out 3.7 million yuan and 1.4 million kilograms of grain, helping more than 26,000 households of farmers solve difficulties in living, medical treatment, housing, and other aspects. At the same time, they have invested 11.1 million yuan to support more than 26,000 households of poor farmers in developing production, and have provided services in technology, information, production, supply, and sales. After the establishment of the mutual aid savings association in Qian Village, Qinjiang County, last year, the association used mutual aid funds to timely purchase high-quality seeds and fertilizers, supporting the villagers in developing production. As a result, grain production increased significantly, and the per capita grain consumption level rose from the original 100-plus kilograms to more than 250 kilograms.
