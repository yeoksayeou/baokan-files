		China's exports, which had declined in the first half of the year, have shown a steady upward trend since July. According to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, by December 10, the total export value reached $39.68 billion, a 6.9% increase over the same period last year. It is expected that the full-year export value will exceed last year's $40.6 billion. The trade balance continues to be in surplus, and the country's foreign exchange reserves have increased significantly.

		Throughout the year, various regions, departments, and enterprises have overcome difficulties such as rising domestic prices, tight funding, and shortages of export goods, energy, and raw materials. They have made concerted efforts to expand exports, reversing the downward trend seen in the first half of the year. Domestic "three-in-one" enterprises that have already started operations have also shown a growing export capacity. By December 10, their total export value reached $2.96 billion, an increase of nearly $1.6 billion compared to the same period last year, more than doubling. Excluding the impact of price increases, the inventory of exported goods nationwide has increased, and the economic benefits of most foreign trade companies have improved.

		The statistics also indicate that by December 10, the total import value nationwide reached $33.486 billion, a 1.3% increase over the same period last year. Unnecessary imports continue to be controlled.

    我外贸出口将超去年
    贸易收支继续保持顺差  国家现汇结存增加较多
    本报北京12月25日讯　本报记者陆振华、新华社记者张毅报道：今年上半年曾一度滑坡而令人担忧的外贸出口，自7月以来扭转了下滑局面，出现了逐月上升的好势头。据经贸部业务统计，截至12月10日，全国出口总额达396.8亿美元，比去年同期增长6.9％，预计全年出口将超过去年406亿美元的实绩。贸易收支继续保持顺差，国家现汇结存有较多增加。
    今年以来，各地区、各部门和企业，克服了国内物价上涨，资金、出口货源、出口生产能源和原材料紧张等困难，努力扩大出口，使出口从下半年以来转降为升。国内已投产开业的“三资”企业也显示了日益增强的出口能力，至12月10日，出口总额为29.6亿美元，比去年同期增加近16亿美元，翻了一番还多。剔除物价上涨因素后，全国出口商品库存量有所增加，大多数外贸公司的经济效益也有所提高。
    这份业务统计还表明，至12月10日，全国进口完成334.86亿美元，比去年同期增加1.3％，一些不必要的进口继续得到控制。
