Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 4th.

More than 40 envoys and diplomats from various countries visited the newly opened China National Art Museum this afternoon. They were invited by the Ministry of Light Industry to view the national art exhibition.

This is the first group of foreign guests to visit the China National Art Museum since its opening. Minister of Light Industry Zeng Xianlin hosted a reception to warmly welcome the visiting envoys.

Over 5,000 pieces of contemporary Chinese artworks attracted great interest from the ambassadors and their spouses. The museum was filled with exclamations of admiration in various languages. In the treasure hall, the exquisite artworks left many ambassadors' spouses speechless with admiration. The on-site performances by Chinese art masters often drew curious diplomats to gather around them. The heads of various diplomatic missions in China, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Betthold, carefully watched the performance by Suzhou embroidery artists and praised the masters' superb skills.

During the visit, Chinese art workers performed ancient zither music for the foreign friends and demonstrated paper cutting, snuff bottle painting, Sichuan embroidery, Suzhou embroidery, and drawing sculpture techniques on site.

As night fell, some foreign guests were still reluctant to leave. The diplomats wrote in the guest book, wishing the development of Chinese art continuous progress.

    外国驻华使节参观工艺美术馆
    新华社北京12月4日电  （记者张超文）40多个国家的驻华使节和外交官员，今天下午兴致勃勃地来到新落成的中国工艺美术馆。他们是应我国轻工业部的邀请前来参观全国工艺美术展览的。
    这是中国工艺美术馆落成以来接待的第一批外国客人。轻工业部长曾宪林为此举行了招待会，热烈欢迎前来参观的各国使节。
    5000余件当代中国的工艺美术佳作，引起大使和夫人们的浓厚兴趣。工艺美术馆里，不时响起不同语言的赞叹声。在珍品馆，琳琅满目的艺术瑰宝令许多大使夫人赞不绝口；现场表演的中国工艺美术大师们常常被惊奇的外交官员团团围住。各国驻华使团长、民主德国驻华大使贝特霍尔德仔细观看了苏州缂艺人的表演，对艺术大师高超的技艺连连称赞。
    在参观过程中，我国艺术工作者为外国友人演奏了古筝民乐，现场表演了剪纸、内画壶、川绣、苏绣和画塑技艺。
    夜幕降临，仍有一些外国客人流连忘返。外交使节们纷纷在留言簿上题字，祝愿中国工艺美术事业不断进步。
