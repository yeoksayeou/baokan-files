Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 18th.

This year, Shenyang City has guided the financial sector to shift its investment focus towards science and technology. It has allocated an additional 50 million yuan in science and technology loans and issued 100 million yuan in short-term financial bonds for science and technology. This has created the conditions for a batch of high-tech and new technology achievements to quickly form production capacity.

Shenyang City has strong scientific and technological capabilities, achieving over a thousand scientific and technological results each year. In the past, the proportion of investment for enterprise technological progress and new product development was only 0.5% of the annual construction investment total. Due to a lack of technical development startup funds, 70% of scientific research results could not be implemented locally, leading to a severe shortage of momentum for Shenyang's economic development and an increasingly apparent efficiency crisis.

To change this situation, Shenyang City has accelerated the development of high-tech and new technology industries, vigorously promoting the integration of science and technology with finance, and opening up channels for funding to flow into science and technology. By leveraging the "adhesive effect" of these two sectors, it gradually guides economic development towards a path of relying on technological progress.

The financial sector has established the first science and technology bank in the country, specifically handling loans for technology, scientific research, electronic computer technology development, and special projects such as "Torch" and "Spark." This supports research institutions and enterprises in developing high-tech and new technology products. It has also piloted scientific research and development working capital loans to address urgent needs. Additionally, a new product development foundation has been established, allowing enterprises and research institutions to allocate 0.5% to 1% of their sales revenue for technical development funds.

At the same time, the scientific and technological sector has organized direct meetings between more than 30 research institutions in the city and the heads of five specialized banks. This allows research institutes to propose high-tech and new technology projects with high benefits. Then, a joint committee of the scientific and technological and financial sectors screens, verifies, and evaluates the proposed projects. After evaluation, they are matched with the financial sector to secure funding.

Statistics show that so far, the Science and Technology Development Credit Department of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Shenyang Branch, has cumulatively issued 170 million yuan in science and technology loans. This year's issuance amount has increased by 50% compared to last year. More than 30 high-tech products assisted by Shenyang's financial sector are gradually forming scale, and some have already achieved significant economic benefits.

    沈阳投资向科技“倾斜”
    一批高新技术成果正迅速形成生产能力
    新华社沈阳12月18日电　（新华社记者姜敏、沈阳日报记者李北斗）今年以来，沈阳市引导金融界将投资重心向科技“倾斜”，相继增拨了5000万元科技贷款和发放1000万元科技短期金融债券，为一批“临产”的高技术新技术成果迅速形成生产能力创造了条件。
    沈阳市科技力量雄厚，每年取得科技成果上千项。过去用于企业技术进步和开发新产品的投资比重仅占每年建设投资总额的0.5％，科研单位和企业因为缺乏技术开发启动资金，致使70％的科研成果不能在本市“生根”、“嫁接”，沈阳经济发展的后劲严重不足，效益危机日益显露。
    为改变这一状况，沈阳市在加速发展高技术新技术产业中，极力促进科技与金融的结合，融通资金向科技投入的渠道，凭借二者的“粘合效应”，逐步将经济的发展引向依靠技术进步的轨道。
    金融部门率先成立了全国第一家带有科技银行性质的科技开发信贷机构，专门办理技术、科研、电子计算机技术开发和“火炬”、“星火”等专项贷款，支持科研单位、企业开发生产高技术新技术产品，并试办了科研开发流动资金贷款，解决他们的燃眉之急。同时，成立了新产品开发基金会，允许企业和科研单位从销售额中提取0.5％至1％，作为技术开发基金。
    同时，科技界组织全市30多家科研单位与市内5家专业银行的负责人直接见面，让科研院所提出自己准备开发的具有高效益的高技术新技术项目，然后由科技界、金融界组成的评估委员会，对申报的项目进行筛选、论证和评审。评审后再拿到金融部门对口衔接，融通资金。
    据统计，到目前为止，中国工商银行沈阳分行科技开发信贷部已累计发放科技贷款1.7亿元，今年的投放额比去年增加50％。沈阳金融界“助产”的30多个高新技术产品，正在陆续形成规模，有的已取得了显著的经济效益。
