The 13th MD-82 aircraft produced through Sino-American cooperation was delivered for use today. The aircraft, which is the 7th one produced this year by the Shanghai Aviation Industry Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, took off from Shanghai this afternoon and was handed over to the Shenyang Aviation Company for operation. This marks a significant progress in the MD-82 project, which has been jointly followed by the governments of China and the United States over the past four years.

Over the past four years of Sino-American cooperation in producing the MD-82 aircraft, Shanghai has successfully introduced and implemented McDonnell Douglas's comprehensive management standards, technical standards, and quality standards. Currently, the number of McDonnell Douglas experts in Shanghai has been reduced from 150 to around 30, and a large number of quality seals have been issued, authorizing Chinese workers to handle production issues on behalf of McDonnell Douglas. The overall assembly qualification rate has reached an excellent 97%.

    中美合作生产的第13架MD—82飞机交付使用
    新华社上海12月27日电（记者陈继明）上海航空工业公司与美国麦道飞机公司今年生产的第7架MD—82飞机，今天下午从上海起飞，交付沈阳航空公司投入营运。这是四年来中美合作生产的第13架飞机。这也标志着中美政府共同关注的MD—82工程取得重大进展。
    中美合作生产MD—82飞机四年来，上海成功地引进并实施了麦道公司成套的管理标准、技术标准和质量标准。现在，麦道公司在上航的150名专家已减至30名左右，并发放了一大批质量印章授权中国职工代表麦道公司处理生产中的问题。飞机总装配一次提交合格率已达97％的最好成绩。
