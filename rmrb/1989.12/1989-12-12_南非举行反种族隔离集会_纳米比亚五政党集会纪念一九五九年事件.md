South Africa Holds Anti-Apartheid Rally

	New York, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa today held the "Convention for a Democratic Future" in Johannesburg, where they adopted a strategic plan to end apartheid rule within 10 years and called on white people to join the struggle.

	Nearly 5,000 representatives from over 2,000 black, white, and colored organizations in South Africa attended the largest anti-apartheid rally since 1955.

	The convention today passed a resolution demanding that South African President de Klerk engage in serious talks with black leaders. The resolution stated that "de Klerk's reforms lack substance" and are aimed at "buying time to readjust the order of minority rule."

	The meeting called on all white people in South Africa to join the majority in ending the apartheid system.

	The meeting demanded non-racial elections to form a government that can build a South Africa without apartheid.

	Diplomats from the United States, Norway, and Japan, as well as two Soviet scholars, attended the convention.

	Namibia: Five Parties Commemorate 1959 Incident

	Windhoek, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Five political parties in Namibia held a rally today at the Old Cemetery to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 1959 massacre.

	Sam Nujoma, chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), said in his speech at the rally: "Thirty years ago, the people who participated in the anti-apartheid movement in Windhoek opened a new chapter in Namibia's contemporary liberation struggle; and now, we are about to bury the 106-year colonial rule of Germany and South Africa."

	On December 10, 1959, black residents of Windhoek staged a peaceful protest against the apartheid government's forced relocation to the black township of Katutura. The protest was brutally suppressed by the colonial authorities, resulting in 13 deaths, 40 injuries, and the arrest of many people. Black leader Sam Nujoma was also imprisoned for a week before going into exile.

	Chairman of the Namibian Constituent Assembly, Hage Geingob, said at the commemoration that he had no doubt that the spirit of harmony and unity shown at today's rally would lead the people of different races in Namibia to achieve national reconciliation.

	The five political parties that participated in the rally included SWAPO, the National Patriotic Front, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, the Democratic Action Group, and the National United Front.

    南非举行反种族隔离集会
    纳米比亚五政党集会纪念一九五九年事件
    新华社哈拉雷12月10日电  约翰内斯堡消息：南非反种族主义领导人今天在这里举行的“争取民主前途大会”上通过了关于在10年内结束南非种族主义统治的战略计划，并且呼吁白人群众加入这场斗争。
    来自南非2000多个黑人、白人、有色人组织的近5000名代表出席了这次自1955年以来最大的反种族隔离大会。
    大会今天通过的决议要求南非总统德克勒克同黑人领导人进行认真的会谈。决议认为，“德克勒克的改革缺乏实质内容”，“是为了争取时间重新调整少数人统治的秩序”。
    会议呼吁南非全体白人同大多数人并肩行动以结束种族隔离制度。
    会议要求举行不分种族的选举，以便组成一个可以建立一个没有种族隔离的南非。
    美国、挪威和日本外交官以及两名苏联学者出席了这次大会。
    新华社温得和克12月10日电　纳米比亚5个政党今天在旧公墓举行集会，纪念1959年大屠杀事件30周年。
    西南非洲人民组织（人组）主席努乔马在集会上的讲话中说：“30年前参加温得和克抵制运动的人们，开创了纳米比亚当代解放斗争的新航程；而我们现在，即将埋葬长达106年德国和南非的殖民统治。”
    1959年12月10日，温得和克旧公墓黑人群众为抗议南非当局强行把他们搬迁到黑人城镇卡图图拉，举行和平示威游行，遭到了殖民者残酷镇压。有13人被杀害，40人受伤，许多人遭到逮捕。黑人领袖努乔马也被监禁了一个星期，随后流亡国外。
    纳米比亚制宪会议主席根哥布在纪念会上说，他毫不怀疑今天集会上所表现出来的和睦与团结精神，将会引导纳米比亚不同种族的人们实现民族和解。
    参加这次集会的有人组、民族爱国阵线、特恩哈尔民主联盟、民主联合阵线、纳米比亚全国阵线等5个政党。
