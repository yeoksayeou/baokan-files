Author: He Zhenbang

Edition: 8

In recent years, a writer from the common people of Sichuan West has emerged, who, after publishing over 2 million words, still maintains the simplicity and honesty of a common person. He is the author of the long novel "The Opera Genealogy" and the long historical novel series "Palace Intrigue," "Kaiyuan Prosperity," "Soul Vanished in Luoyang Palace," and "Tianbao Storm" - Wu Yinyi. Some friends in the literary circle call him the "Sichuan West Eccentric." They say he is "eccentric" because, although he has gained fame, he remains humble and simple, often dressed in disarray, not putting on airs of a writer. Many people who do not know him well often have difficulty distinguishing him from farmers going to market. They also say he is "eccentric" because he has a warm heart, likes to meddle in literary affairs, loves to help others, and is enthusiastic about organizing a team for historical novel creation. Therefore, people think he not only has writing talent but also the talent of a literary organizer. This, of course, is also part of his "genius." However, his outstanding talent is mainly reflected in the creation of historical novels. He has already won a large number of readers with over 2 million words of works.

Wu Yinyi comes from a family of opera performers. At the age of three or four, he began learning opera from his father. As he grew older, he performed on stage, playing the role of a clown in Sichuan opera. Later, he went to school, attended a technical school, worked as a technician, and experienced many ups and downs in life. After the Cultural Revolution ended, he was already in his thirties. At this time, he picked up his pen again to write novels. His debut novel, "The Opera Genealogy," tells the story of a Sichuan opera troupe in the northwestern part of Sichuan, traveling from village to village and town to town during the period from the victory of the Anti-Japanese War to the national liberation. This work was appreciated by Shanghai Literature and Arts Publishing House and was published in the early 1980s. When he was revising this debut novel in Shanghai, he saw that Lu Xun had once planned to write about Emperor Tang Minghuang and Yang Guifei, and he suddenly had the idea to realize Lu Xun's unrealized creation plan. Thus, he had the idea and action to create a series of historical novels about Emperor Tang Minghuang. After that, he spent about five or six years reading "Zizhi Tongjian," with the help of his wife Zhao Shumei, to search for and collect related historical materials and conduct on-site investigations. Then he undertook quite arduous creation. Five or six years later, this series of novels, with Emperor Tang Minghuang Li Longji as the main line, depicting the social landscape of mid-Tang Dynasty, and writing the historical process of Tang Dynasty society from chaos to order and then from order to chaos, successfully created the semi-dark and semi-bright middle-reigning emperor Li Longji and the new artistic images of eunuch Gao Lishi, favorite concubine Yang Yuhuan, etc., totaling 1200,000 words, divided into four volumes of the Tang Minghuang series of long historical novels, finally completed.

This series of books has been printed 600,000 times, welcomed by a wide range of readers, and has had a broad and strong social impact. Currently, the China Television Drama Art Center is recreating and preparing to adapt this series into an 80-episode television series, bringing the historical story of Tang Minghuang and Yang Guifei to the screen. The creation, publication, and adaptation of this series of historical novels, which is praised as a panoramic painting of the mid-Tang Dynasty society, have made Wu Yinyi, an unknown commoner, suddenly rise to the literary circle and become a well-known historical novelist. Speaking of the creation and publication of this series of historical novels, Wu Yinyi will never forget the concern and support of the deputy editor-in-chief, editor-in-chief, and ordinary editors of the China Youth Publishing House who are in charge of literature. He always maintains a deep affection with them.

It is the publication and considerable success of the four-volume Tang Minghuang series of historical novels "Palace Intrigue" that made Wu Yinyi taste the hard work and joy of historical novel creation in the field of historical novel creation, and thus he continued to cultivate tirelessly without knowing fatigue. After that, he completed the long historical novel "Labyrinth of the Mysterious" about the late life of Emperor Tang Taizong Li Shimin and the two-volume historical novel "Empress Wu" describing the legendary experience of Wu Zetian, the only female emperor in Chinese history, which will be published by Huacheng Publishing House and China Youth Publishing House respectively. This nearly 1000,000-word historical novel creation will make Wu Yinyi explore what in historical novels again, which is what we are looking forward to.

    从川西走出的“平民作家”
    ——吴因易和他的历史小说
    何镇邦
    近年来，从川西大地上走出一位来自平民百姓中的作家，在他发表了200多万字作品后，仍然保持着平民百姓质朴、拙实的本色。他就是长篇小说《梨园谱》，长篇系列历史小说《宫闱惊变》、《开元盛世》、《魂销骊宫》、《天宝狂飚》等作品的作者吴因易。文坛上的一些朋友称他为
  “川西怪杰”。说他“怪”，是他虽然已经成名，却仍然谦逊质朴，衣衫不整，不摆作家的架子，不少不熟悉他的人常常难以把他同一些赶集的农民分辨出来；说他
  “怪”，还因为他有一副热心肠，爱管文坛中的闲事，爱帮助人，还热心于组织一支历史小说的创作队伍。因此，人们认为他不仅有写作的才能，还兼有文学活动组织家的才能。这当然也是他“杰”的一方面。不过，他杰出的才能主要还是表现在历史小说创作方面，他已经以200多万言的作品赢得了众多的读者。
    吴因易出身于梨园世家，三四岁时就从其父学戏，及长，粉墨登场，饰演过川剧中的丑角。后来上了学堂，进过中专，当过技术人员，历尽人生的坎坷。“文革”结束之后，他已届而立之年。这时，他又拿起笔来写小说。处女作长篇小说《梨园谱》，写川西北的一个川剧草台班，于抗日战争胜利后全国解放前，在川西北地区走乡串镇的故事。此作得到上海文艺出版社的赏识，于八十年代初出版。当他在上海修改这部长篇处女作时，又看到鲁迅当年有过写唐明皇与杨贵妃的打算，便突发奇想，想把鲁迅当年未能实现的创作计划付诸实践，于是就有了唐明皇历史小说系列的创作计划和行动。此后大概用了五、六年的时间，他通读《资治通鉴》，在其妻赵蜀梅的帮助下查阅和收集有关史料，并进行实地调查，然后进行相当艰苦的创作。五、六年之后，这一套以唐明皇李隆基为主线，以广阔的历史画面扫描唐代中期社会面貌，写出唐代社会由乱而治又由治而乱的历史过程，成功创造了“半昏半明”的中兴风流天子李隆基以及太监高力士、宠妃杨玉环等有新意的艺术形象，共120多万字，分四卷的长篇历史小说唐明皇系列，终于出齐。
    这一套书共印行了60多万册，受到广大读者的欢迎，产生了较广泛而强烈的社会影响。目前，中国电视剧艺术中心正在进行再创造，准备把这个系列改编为80集的电视连续剧，把唐明皇与杨贵妃的历史故事搬上荧屏。这一被誉为中唐社会全景式画卷的系列历史小说的创作、出版和改编，使吴因易的这个名不见经传的平民百姓一跃登上文坛，成为一个有相当知名度的历史小说作家。说起这个系列历史小说的创作和出版，吴因易忘不了中国青年出版社的主管文艺的副总编、编辑室主任和普通编辑对他的关心和扶持。他始终与他们保持一种深切的感情。
    正是《宫闱惊变》等四卷本的唐明皇系列历史小说的出版和取得相当程度的成功，使吴因易在历史小说创作的园地里尝到了创作的艰辛和乐趣，因而乐而不知返，一直不知疲倦地进行耕耘。在此之后，他又完成了写唐太宗李世民晚年生活的长篇历史小说《奇骊迷宫》和描述我国历史上唯一的女皇帝武则天传奇经历的两卷本历史小说《则天大帝》，将分别由花城出版社和中国青年出版社出版。这近百万言的历史小说创作，使吴因易在历史小说上又探得了什么，将是我们所期待的。
