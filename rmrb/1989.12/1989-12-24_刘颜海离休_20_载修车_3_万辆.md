Liu Yanhai, the former platoon leader of the Beijing Military Region's Baoding Aviation Reserve School and a retired cadre, has voluntarily repaired over 30,000 bicycles in the 20 years since his retirement, earning praise from many people.

Liu Yanhai joined the revolution in 1942 and worked as an intelligence officer in the county's enemy work department for over two years. He often rode a bicycle to deliver intelligence. Once, while on the way, he encountered the enemy. He pedaled hard and left the enemy far behind, escaping danger. Since then, he has had a special affection for bicycles. In 1967, due to his diabetes, the organization decided he should retire for medical treatment. He did not lie down to rest but chose a job suitable for his physical condition and voluntarily repaired bicycles for the people.

In the spring of 1968, he hung out a sign for voluntary bicycle repairs and cleared out one of the three rooms in his house to use as a repair shop. People came to have their bicycles repaired every day without interruption. He also often went to military units, retirement homes, factories, schools, and busy areas in the city to repair bicycles on a regular basis. Wherever he went, he never forgot to bring his toolbox, repairing bicycles wherever he went.

    刘颜海离休20载修车3万辆
    北京军区驻保定航空预备学校原学员队长、离休干部刘颜海，离休20年义务修理自行车三万余辆，受到许多人的交口称赞。
    刘颜海1942年参加革命后，在县敌工部情报站当过两年多情报员，常骑自行车送情报。有一次途中和敌人遭遇，他骑车猛蹬，将敌人远远甩在后面，脱离了危险。从此他对自行车有特殊感情。1967年，因他患糖尿病，组织上决定他离职休养。他没有躺下来养病，选择了适合自己体力的工作，义务为群众修车。
    1968年春，他义务修车的牌子挂了出去，把家里的三间平房腾出一间作修车间。上门修车的人天天不断。他也常到驻军单位、干休所、厂矿、学校等单位及市内较繁华的地方定期巡回修车。他无论外出干什么，总忘不了带上工具箱，走到哪里修到哪里。
