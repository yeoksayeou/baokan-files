Fuzhou City's Family Planning Commission Director Chen Shuping turned on a projector. The screen displayed a scene of makeshift huts with children playing under a row of diapers hanging like a "flag of many nations." A young woman with a baby in her arms and three children holding her hands entered the frame.

This was the wife of a migrant worker, photographed in 1986 at a construction site in Fuzhou City. She had left her hometown four or five years ago, following her husband wherever he worked, cooking for him and having children.

Chen Shuping said, "In recent years, Fuzhou City has had a daily floating population of 400,000, with 250,000 in the urban area, which is a quarter of the city's permanent population, posing significant challenges to family planning work."

In the Xiyingli Agricultural Market in Fuzhou City, out of 400 individual vendors from rural areas, 57 were households with more than three children, exceeding the planned number. In Yongtai County's Second Construction Team, which has been stationed in Sanming for a long time, out of more than 100 team members, there were more than 10 who had exceeded the planned number of children.

For a considerable period, due to the lack of management of the temporary residences of the floating population, the birth control of the floating population was in a state of severe anarchy.

Fuzhou: Managing the Floating Population

In early 1988, the municipal committee and government listed the management of the floating population's family planning as a key task for rectification, stipulating that "wherever the outbound population goes, the local government and functional departments of that place are responsible, with the inflow place closely cooperating, and no one shirking or passing the buck; the city, county (district), township (street), and relevant departments sign responsibility contracts for the management of the floating population's birth control, implementing target management."

To this end, the municipal government established a leading group for the management of the floating population's family planning, consisting of government, family planning, public security, commerce, construction, labor and personnel, health, and civil affairs departments, to handle macro-coordination; the municipal family planning commission added a "Floating Population Management Bureau"; the municipal government issued the "Temporary Regulations on the Management of the Floating Population's Family Planning in Fuzhou City" and the "Notice on the Management of the Floating Population's Family Planning in Fuzhou City"; the public security, court, commerce, construction, and health departments also formulated management methods based on their respective industry characteristics.

To make this management work routine, floating population family planning management service stations, floating population pregnancy reporting centers, and floating population family planning management patrol service teams were established in all counties, districts, townships (streets) across the city.

How effective is this implementation? The reporter visited the Taijiang Port Market under the jurisdiction of the Taijiang Street Committee in Fuzhou City's Taijiang District. This is one of the top ten agricultural markets in the country. A young woman dressed fashionably stood in front of the reporter with a smile: "I am Cai Meiai. I am the chairman of the individual cooperative and am in charge of business organization, political study, and family planning."

She said, "Our Taijiang District has been rated as an advanced unit in the province and city for 10 consecutive years. The indicators set by the district are very high, with a family planning rate of 99.8%. If there is one unplanned pregnancy, the indicator will not be achieved, and we individual business owners cannot drag down the entire district. Last year, we spent nearly six months registering and filling out cards for all individual business owners in the district, establishing files on the reproductive status of women of childbearing age, to detect problems in time and take immediate action."

According to Chen Shuping, in the past year, Fuzhou City mobilized more than 10,000 floating population members to implement contraceptive measures, and the birth rate last year was the lowest in the province.

Jianou: Leading by Example, Doubling Efforts

In Jianou County, a county of over 460,000 people in northern Fujian, the director of the family planning commission, Chen Zhousheng, told the reporter, "Generally, the masses are quite reasonable. In some places, the implementation of family planning is difficult, often because the party members and cadres have not set a good example. The masses often say, 'We don't mind the policy being strict, but we mind it being unfair.'"

She mentioned an incident: In 1986, Fangdao Township in this county had 24 couples of childbearing age who could not implement contraceptive measures, and the cadres were anxious. After inquiring among the masses, it turned out that three of them were relatives of the township party committee deputy secretary, discipline inspection committee secretary, and women's federation director. Everyone's eyes were on these three households. After knowing this, the three party member leaders immediately implemented contraceptive measures for their relatives. As a result, the other 21 couples also quickly implemented the measures. Since then, Fangdao Township's family planning work has always been at the forefront of the county.

Since 1987, Jianou County has opened population courses at the county and township level party schools to train party cadres on the basic knowledge of population and family planning. Now, 204 township and village party cadres in the county can explain population and family planning basic knowledge and policies to the masses. They are often active among the masses. The county family planning commission, in collaboration with the county committee organization department and propaganda department, produced a family planning propaganda film titled "National Policy," which was shown 506 times. In addition to the 14,500 party members in the county receiving population situation education, more than 120,000 masses also watched it. Additionally, 83% of the 8,300 peasant party members in this county participated in the linked household activities, taking on the task of family planning propaganda and mobilization.

The leading role of the party members has had a good influence on the masses.

Nanping: Village Associations for Self-Management

Upon arriving in Nanping, the regional family planning commission director Chen Deming excitedly told the reporter, "By the end of October this year, Nanping region's 10 counties (cities), 138 townships (streets), and 1,731 villages (resident committees) have all established family planning associations." The establishment of such mass organizations in administrative villages has greatly helped in carrying out mass self-education, self-service, self-supervision, and various effective propaganda and service activities.

The director of the family planning commission in Jianyang County, Ni Shuji, vividly recounted many small stories that happened in her county to the reporter: In Huangkeng Township's Xinfeng Village, the family planning association director and villager Chen Yuzhen had two daughters and underwent sterilization. Last year, one of her children died of leukemia. Someone advised her to undergo a reversal operation to have another child, and someone else advised her to adopt another child, but she declined both and, after discussing with her husband, obtained a certificate for a single child, setting a good example in the entire village. This year, she actively organized and led all the villagers to participate in the study and competition of basic knowledge of population and family planning, winning the team championship. During the "5·21" major flood in 1988, more than 600 family planning association members from various villages in Tancheng Town and Xiaohu Township actively donated more than 2,000 yuan, more than 700 jin of grain tickets, and more than 700 pieces of clothing to help the affected fellow villagers. Tancheng Zhongnan Street member Huang Binghua also actively donated 1,000 yuan to support education...

In rural areas, there is a group of retired cadres, party members, experts, workers, and models (known as the "five olds"). They have high prestige and influence, understand science and policy, have experience, and have close relationships with the masses. Inviting them to be directors or chairpersons of the family planning association is not only something they are willing to do but also something the masses welcome.

The reporter visited the home of Yang Dexiang, the deputy chairman of the family planning association in Jiaqiu Village, Liantan Township, Pucheng County, and had a chat. This retired old secretary lives on a half-mountain slope far from the village, with only him and his wife. His home is often full of guests, becoming the "members' home" of the family planning association.

Pucheng: Colorful "Three-None" Village Activities

Pucheng County's standing committee member in charge of family planning, Yao Aiqin, believes that the core of rural family planning work at present is to control unplanned pregnancies. In the past, the average rate of induced abortions in Pucheng was 1:2.3. We should be responsible to the masses, changing the management from post-pregnancy remedial type to pre-pregnancy service type, so that sisters suffer less pain. After launching the "No Unplanned Pregnancy" village activity in 1985, the abortion rate quickly dropped to 1:1.3.

The masses of Pucheng, which was once a revolutionary base area, have a strong overall concept and group awareness, and can consciously link the good or bad of their village's family planning work with their own interests, willing to make their village a "No Unplanned Pregnancy" village as soon as possible. This also has a restraining effect on some couples who want to have more children. By the end of September this year, 82% of the 297 administrative villages in the county had become "No Unplanned Pregnancy" villages.

Since 1987, based on the "No Unplanned Pregnancy" villages, the county has proposed the "Three-None" village activity of "No Early Marriage and Childbearing" and "No Late-Term Induced Abortion" for all administrative villages in the county.

By the end of September this year, the county's "Three-None" villages had reached 178, accounting for 60%. Through the activities from "One-None" village to "Three-None" village, the county's birth rate dropped from 13.36‰ in 1984 to 10.96‰ in 1988; the one-child rate increased from 63.14% to 82.45%; the multiple-child rate dropped from 9.96% to 0.72%; and the family planning rate increased from 64.35% to 92.16%.

Insurance Company: Not Profiting from Family Planning

Not long ago, Lan Tianfu, a villager from Gulou Yuxi Village, had his child fall from the stage during a play, resulting in a fractured brain and femur, with medical expenses exceeding 1,000 yuan. The insurance company reimbursed him 800 yuan in one go.

In the current economic conditions, "raising children for old age" remains a prominent issue affecting family planning. In recent years, insurance for the safety of only children, old-age insurance for parents of only children, old-age insurance for couples with two daughters who have undergone sterilization, and safe operation insurance for sterilization, as well as old-age savings through the population welfare fund, have had a good impact in Fujian Province. Some people believe that by doing good deeds and practical things for the masses, the image of family planning has indeed been improved, and the masses' views on childbearing have been changed, consolidating and developing the achievements of family planning.

According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, the number of insured people in Fujian Province had reached more than 110,000, with an insurance amount of 2.9 million yuan.

The reporter asked He Guangfu, the manager of Nanping Regional Insurance Company, who was rated as an active family planning worker in Fujian Province in 1988, "According to your implementation of only-child safety insurance regulations, do you compensate or not? It is said that banks and insurance companies make money, right!"

He Guangfu smiled and replied, "We make money in other industries. Only in family planning do we absolutely not make money, and sometimes we even lose money."

Achievements Are Great, But No Room for Relaxation

In May last year, the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress promulgated the "Fujian Province Family Planning Regulations." Now, even in remote mountainous areas, women can explain "legal marriage age," "late marriage age," and relevant family planning policies.

In addition to extensive propaganda, many cities and counties in this province have strengthened family planning work from the aspects of leadership system, personnel configuration, personnel treatment, and business funds.

The province commissioned Xiamen University to open a population college to train in-service family planning cadres.

Fujian's population control has achieved significant results, but Vice Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Jia Qinglin said, "Due to the implementation of family planning, Fujian Province has reduced the population by nearly 4 million in 10 years, which is indeed a great achievement. However, we still face a very serious problem. Our neighboring Zhejiang Province and Sichuan Province, which has the largest population in the country, both have a natural population growth rate of around 10‰, while ours is still 14.7‰, so we must resolutely implement family planning and persist in it without relaxation."

    八方协力  落实国策
    ——福建省计划生育工作侧记
    本报记者  艾笑
    福州市计生委主任陈书碧打开放像机。屏幕上出现一片横七竖八的工棚，大大小小的儿童在尿布排挂的“万国旗”下追逐戏闹。一位面目姣好的少妇怀抱1个、手领3个小孩进入镜头。
    这是一位民工的妻子，1986年摄于福州市的一个建筑工地。她离开家乡已四五年，丈夫迁到哪里做工，她就跟到哪里为他烧饭、生孩子。
    陈书碧说：“这几年，福州市日流动人口达40万，其中市区就占25万，是市区常住人口的1／4，给计划生育工作造成很大困难。”
    福州市西营里农贸市场里400个来自农村的个体户摊贩中，就有57个3胎以上的超计划生育户；永泰县二建第二工程队长期驻在三明地区，仅100多人的工程队，就有10多个超计划生育者。
    有相当一段时间，由于对流动人口临时居住地的计划生育管理工作没有跟上，流动人口的生育问题处于严重的无政府状态。
    福州，流动人口管出门道
    1988年初，市委、市政府把流动人口的计划生育管理列为治理整顿的硬任务，规定“外流人口流到哪里，就由哪里的地方政府和职能部门负责，由流入地密切配合，相互间不等不靠不推诿；市、县（区）、乡（街道）及有关部门层层签订流动人口生育管理工作的承包责任书，实行目标管理。”
    为此，市政府出面成立了由政府、计生委、公安、工商、建委、劳动人事、卫生、民政等部门参加的流动人口计生管理领导小组，抓宏观协调；市计生委增设“流动人口管理科”；市政府发布了《福州市流动人口计生管理暂行规定》和《福州市流动人口计生管理通告》；公安、法院、工商、建工、卫生等部门还根据各自行业特点制定了管理办法。
    为使这项管理工作经常化，在全市各县区、乡镇（街道）还成立了流动人口计划生育管理服务站、流动人口违反计划生育孕情举报中心和流动人口计划生育管理巡检服务队。
    这样实施的效果怎样呢？记者来到福州市台江区瀛洲街道委员会管辖内的台江码头市场。这是全国十大农贸市场之一。一位穿着入时的女青年笑嘻嘻地站到记者面前：“我叫蔡美爱。是个体协会的会长，主管经营组织、政治学习和计划生育。”
    她说：“我们台江区已经连续10年被评为全省、全市的红旗先进单位了。区里订的指标都很高，计划生育率要达到99.8％。要是出了1个计划外怀孕的，这指标就保不住，我们个体户哪能拖全区的后腿？去年，我们差不多用了6个月的时间对全区个体户逐摊、逐店一人不漏地登记填卡造册，立了育龄妇女生育情况档案，以便随时发现问题，立即做工作。”
    据陈书碧介绍：一年来，福州全市共动员流动人口落实节育措施1万多例，去年人口出生率是全省最低的。
    建瓯，先抓党员事半功倍
    在闽北的一个46万多人的大县建瓯，计生委主任陈周生对记者说：“其实，群众一般都很通情达理。有些地方计划生育工作推行困难，往往是党员干部没带好头。群众常反映，不怕政策严，就怕不公平。”
    她提起一件事：1986年，这个县的房道乡际村有24对育龄夫妇节育措施落实不下去，干部们心急火燎。到群众中一打听，原来其中有3对是乡党委副书记、纪委书记和妇联主任的亲戚，大家都把眼睛盯着这3户。这3位党员领导干部知道后，立即使自己的亲属落实了节育措施。结果，其他21对也都很快地落实了。从此，房道乡的计划生育工作总是走在全县前列。
    从1987年开始，建瓯县开设了县、乡两级党校人口课，对党员骨干进行人口与计划生育基础知识的培训。现在全县已有204名乡、村党员干部能对群众讲解人口与计划生育基础知识和政策的课程，他们经常活跃在群众中。这个县计生委配合县委组织部、宣传部录制了一部名为《国策》的计划生育宣教片，播放了506场，除全县1.45万党员普遍受到人口形势教育外，12万多群众也收看了。此外，这个县的8300多名农民党员中83％参加了联系户活动，承担计划生育宣传动员工作。
    党员的带头作用很好地影响了广大群众。
    南平，村办协会群众自理
    一到南平，地区计生委主任陈德修就兴奋地告诉记者：“到今年10月底，南平地区10个县（市）、138个乡镇（街道）、1731个村（居委会）全都建立了计划生育协会。”行政村建起计生协这样的群众组织，对开展群众自我教育、自我服务、自我监督和各种卓有成效的宣传服务活动有极大帮助。
    建阳县计生委主任倪淑姬向记者娓娓地讲述了发生在她县里的许多小故事：黄坑乡新峰村计生协理事、村民陈玉珍生了两个女儿后做了绝育，去年她一个孩子患白血病死去。有人劝她作变通手术再生一个，还有人劝她再抱养一个，她都谢绝了，却同丈夫商量后领取了独生子女证，在全村造成很好影响。今年，她积极组织和带领全村会员参加人口和计划生育基础知识学习和竞赛，获得了团体第一名。1988年“5·21”特大洪灾中，潭城镇、小湖乡各村的600多名计生协会员主动捐款2000多元、粮票700多斤、衣服700多件帮助受灾乡亲。潭城中南街会员黄炳华还主动捐助1000元支持办学……
    在农村，有一批离退休的老干部、老党员、老专家、老职工、老模范（人称“五老”）。他们威信高影响大，懂科学懂政策又有经验，与群众的关系也密切。请出他们当计生协理事、会长，不仅他们自己乐意，群众还非常欢迎。
    记者到浦城县莲塘乡九秋村计生协副会长杨德祥的家里作了一回客。这位退休的老支书住在离村较远的半山坡上，只有他和老伴两口人。他家经常是高朋满座，成了计生协“会员之家”。
    浦城，有声有色的“三无”村活动
    浦城县主管计划生育的县常委姚爱琴认为：当前，农村计划生育工作的核心是控制住计划外怀孕。过去浦城全县平均人工流产率1∶2.3。我们应当对群众负责，要把管理由孕后补救型变成孕前服务型，使姐妹们少受痛苦。1985年开展“无计划外”村活动后，人流率迅速降至1∶1.3。
    曾是革命老区的浦城群众全局观念和群体意识是强的，能自觉地把本村的计划生育工作好坏同自己的切身利益紧密联系起来，愿意自己的村子早日成为“无计划外”村。这对一些想超生的育龄夫妇也起了约束作用。截止到今年9月，全县的297个行政村已有82％成了“无计划外”村。
    1987年开始，在“无计划外”村的基础上，对全县行政村又提出了再创“无早婚早育”和“无大月份引产”的“三无”村活动。
    到今年9月底，这个县的“三无”村已有178个，占60％。通过“一无”村到“三无”村活动，这个县的人口出生率由1984年的13.36‰，下降到1988年的10.96‰；一孩率由63.14％上升到82.45％，多孩率由9.96％下降到0.72％，计划生育率由64.35％上升到92.16％。
    保险公司，不赚计划生育钱
    前不久，古楼洋溪村村民兰天福的孩子看戏从台上掉下来，造成大脑和大腿骨折，医疗费花去1000多元。保险公司一次就为他报销800多元。
    在现阶段经济条件下，“养儿防老”仍是影响计划生育的突出问题。近几年，独生子女平安保险、独生子女父母养老金保险、二女结扎户的夫妇养老金保险、绝育手术平安保险，以及通过人口福利基金会推行的养老储金等，在福建省已产生良好的影响。有人认为，这样为群众办好事、办实事，确实改善了党群关系，改变了计划生育的形象，促进了群众生育观的转变，巩固发展了计划生育成果。
    据不完全统计，到去年年底，福建全省投保人数已达11万多人，投保金额290余万元。
    记者问曾被评为1988年福建省计划生育积极分子的南平地区保险公司经理何光富：“按你们实行的独生子女平安保险规定，你们赔不赔呀？据说，银行和保险公司都是赚钱的呀！”
    何光富笑答：“我们对其它的行业都是赚钱的。唯独对计划生育绝对不赚，有时还赔钱。”
    成绩很大，但一点松懈不得
    去年5月，省人大常委会颁布了《福建省计划生育条例》，如今在偏远山区，妇女们也能道出“法定婚龄”、“晚婚年龄”和有关的计划生育政策。
    除广泛宣传，这个省的不少地市还从领导制度、编制配备、人员待遇和业务经费等方面，对计划生育工作给予了特别加强。
    省里委托厦门大学开办了人口大专班，培养在职计划生育干部。
    福建的人口控制取得了明显的成绩，但省委副书记贾庆林说：“由于抓计划生育，福建省10年少生了近400万人，这的确是很大成绩。可是，我们面前还摆着十分严峻的课题。我们的近邻浙江省、全国人口最多的四川省，人口自然增长率都在10‰左右，而我们还是14.7‰，所以，我们必须坚决抓计划生育，常抓不懈。”
