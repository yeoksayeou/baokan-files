Premier Li Peng met with Chinese and foreign representatives attending the International Symposium on Education Towards the 21st Century this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. He said that holding such a conference is of great significance in promoting the development of educational science and practice, as well as in enhancing friendship and exchange between China and other countries around the world.

After warmly welcoming the foreign educators, Li Peng briefed the guests on China's domestic situation and development strategy. He also elaborated on China's educational guidelines and introduced the current state of education in China. He summarized China's educational policy into three main points: first, to be forward-looking, modern, and oriented towards the world; second, to emphasize the comprehensive development of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness; third, to serve socialist construction, with socialist construction relying on education. He stressed that education is essentially to serve China's prosperity and strength. Li Peng also systematically introduced the basic components of China's education system, which includes primary education, vocational and technical education, higher education, and adult education. He emphasized that education is still a weak link and must be strengthened in the future, especially by enhancing the training of primary and secondary school teachers and improving the quality of higher education.

Li Peng said that China's policy of opening up to the outside world not only involves learning advanced science and technology and management experience from other countries but also learning and borrowing beneficial cultural and educational experiences that suit China's national conditions. The Chinese government and educators are willing to cooperate and exchange with educational circles from all countries in various forms.

The Director-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor, thanked Premier Li Peng for his comprehensive introduction. He said that this symposium exchanged views on the problems facing education, which is very beneficial for promoting the development of international education and strengthening international exchanges. China's experience in improving the education system is worth learning from by other countries. UNESCO will continue to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of education.
