The seventh Asian Women's Football Championship concluded tonight. The Chinese team defeated the Chinese Taipei team 1-0 in the final, successfully defending their Asian title.

The decisive match was intense from the start. In the first two minutes, China frequently shot on goal, putting psychological pressure on the opposing team. The Taipei team, however, was not intimidated and organized counterattacks vigorously.

The Chinese players are tall and have good stamina, often using long passes and quick attacks. In the 20th minute of the first half, No. 7 Wu Wei Ying made a run down the right side and scored a goal when the opposing goalkeeper rushed out, but it was blocked by a Taipei defender out of bounds. China earned a corner kick, and No. 3 Ma Li headed the ball into the net from the penalty area. China broke the deadlock.

After that, China's attacking pace slowed down, and Taipei closely marked China's key players, saving several dangerous balls. Both sides had several free-kick opportunities but failed to score.

In the second half, China had more shooting opportunities but failed to convert any. In the melee, No. 14 Zhang Yan received a yellow card warning. Taipei seized the opportunity to attack, and in the 6th minute, a powerful long-range shot was narrowly saved by China's goalkeeper Zhong Honglian, who tipped the ball over the crossbar.

Afterward, China had nearly 10 corner kicks and shooting opportunities, all of which were blocked by the opposing defenders and goalkeeper. Among them, No. 10 Liu Ailing had a powerful shot inside the penalty area that narrowly missed, which was the most regrettable.

Chinese Taipei's No. 4 Lu Juyin was named the best player of the tournament. Tonight, the Japanese team defeated Hong Kong 9-0 to take third place.

Chinese team leader Yang Xiuwu commented after the match that this tournament showed that Asian women's football will enter a stage where four teams compete for the top spot in the future. The four teams are China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    决赛中以一比零力克中国台北队
    中国女足再夺亚洲桂冠
    本报香港12月29日电　记者连锦添报道：第7届亚洲女子足球锦标赛今晚落幕。中国队在决赛中以1∶0战胜中国台北队，蝉联亚洲冠军。
    今晚夺魁之役一开始就十分激烈。头两分钟，中国队频频射门，给对方以心理压力。而台北队也不示弱，积极组织反攻。
    中国队队员身材高体力好，多采用长传急攻。上半场第20分钟时，7号吴伟英右路突进，乘对方守门员出击之际射空门，被台北队后卫挡出底线。中国队得角球机会，3号马莉在禁区迎球一顶，球入网底。中国队打破平局。
    其后中国队进攻速度放慢，台北队盯紧中国队主力，数度救出险球。双方都有几个任意球机会，均未破门。
    下半场中国队射门机会更多，但均无功而返。混战中，14号张岩被黄牌警告。台北队伺机进攻，6分钟时远距离射门强劲有力，中国队守门员钟红莲将球托出横梁，才化险为夷。
    这以后，中国队有近10次角球及射门机会，均被对方后卫和守门员奋力阻挡。其中10号刘爱玲有一次禁区内劲射未中，最为可惜。
    中国台北队4号罗居银被评为本届比赛最佳球员。今晚日本队以9比0大败香港队，获第3名。
    中国队领队杨秀武赛后发表看法认为，通过这次赛事可以看出，亚洲女足今后将进入4强相争的形势，4强是中国、中国台北、日本和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国队。
