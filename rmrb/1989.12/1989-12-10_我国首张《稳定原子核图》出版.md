China's first "Stable Nuclear Chart" has been published. According to Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan on December 9th, two engineers from Shanxi Province have drawn up the first "Stable Nuclear Chart" in China, which has been published by the Science and Technology University Press.

Stable nuclei are the basic units that make up the material world at a deeper level than elements, totaling 287 types. They have important uses in physics research and nuclear engineering.

The creators of the "Stable Nuclear Chart," Wang Yuying and Ren Yongheng, are engineers from the Lu'an Mining Bureau and Shanxi Electric Machine Factory, respectively. The new "Stable Nuclear Chart" is not only easy to use but also provides detailed data on nuclear isotopes, including mass number, proton number, neutron number, abundance, and nuclear spin.
