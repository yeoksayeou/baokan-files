The United States' invasion of Panama violates international law. The Security Council's resolution to condemn the action was vetoed by the U.S., Britain, and France.

NEW YORK, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss the situation in Panama. The meeting ended with a vote on a resolution to condemn the U.S. military intervention in Panama, which failed to pass due to vetoes from the United States, Britain, and France, three permanent members of the Security Council.

The resolution, proposed by Colombia and seven other non-aligned countries, was supported by China and 10 other countries during the vote. Canada also voted against it, while Finland abstained. This indicates that the majority of the Security Council members oppose the U.S. invasion of Panama.

The resolution states that the U.S. invasion of Panama is an infringement on the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of another country, and a blatant violation of international law.

The resolution demands that the United States immediately stop its interference and withdraw its armed forces from Panama.

The resolution emphasizes that Panama has the sovereign right to freely determine its social, economic, and political systems and to develop its international relations without foreign interference, interference, coercion, or threats.

    美国入侵巴拿马违反国际法
    安理会谴责提案竟遭美等国否决
    本报联合国12月23日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天下午继续举行紧急会议，审议巴拿马局势。会议最后表决谴责美国武装干涉巴拿马的决议草案，由于美国、英国和法国三个常任理事国的否决，未能通过。
    这项由哥伦比亚等7个不结盟国家提出的决议草案在表决时，得到中国等10国的赞成。加拿大也投了反对票，芬兰弃权。这表明安理会绝大多数理事国是反对美国入侵巴拿马的。
    决议指出，美国入侵巴拿马是侵犯他国的独立、主权和领土完整，是公然违反国际法。
    决议要求美国立即停止干涉，其武装部队撤离巴拿马。
    决议强调，巴拿马有自由决定其社会、经济、政治制度以及在没有外国干涉、干扰、胁迫或威胁情况下发展其国际关系的主权权利。
