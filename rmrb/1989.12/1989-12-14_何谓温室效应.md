The greenhouse effect is primarily caused by gases such as carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide, which are released into the atmosphere through human activities. Among these gases, carbon dioxide is the most significant.

The specific manifestation of the greenhouse effect is as follows: after the Earth absorbs the visible light from the sun, it radiates the absorbed infrared heat back into the atmosphere. A portion of this heat is absorbed by the aforementioned greenhouse gases, thereby increasing the atmospheric temperature. If the quantity of these gases continues to increase unchecked, the greenhouse effect will intensify, leading to a warmer global climate. Ultimately, this will disrupt the ecological environment and threaten human survival.

Carbon dioxide is the most widespread pollutant. In the last century, approximately 900 million tons of carbon dioxide were released into the atmosphere annually. Currently, this figure has risen to 5 billion tons. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the amount of carbon dioxide released is expected to double by the year 2050. This gas primarily originates from the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). There are countless factories and power plants worldwide that use fossil fuels for energy, as well as numerous motor vehicles. The exhaust from these sources is the primary contributor to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Additionally, due to the extensive use of refrigerators, air conditioners, and the production of plastics and cleaning of electronic components in modern society, approximately 700,000 tons of chlorofluorocarbons are released into the atmosphere each year.

    何谓温室效应
    方文
    由人类社会活动产生的二氧化碳、氯氟烃和氧化亚氮等气体，日夜向大气中释放，是造成温室效应的主要原因。这些气体中尤以二氧化碳为甚。
    温室效应的具体表现是：地球吸收到太阳照射的可见光后，会向大气放射出它所吸收到的红外辐射热，其中一部分随即被大气中的上述温室气体吸收，从而使大气温度增高。如果，这些气体的数量无节制地继续增加，便会加剧温室效应，使全球气候越来越暖，最终破坏生态环境，威胁人类生存。二氧化碳是分布最广的一种污染物。上个世纪，每年释放于大气的二氧化碳为900万吨，目前已增至50亿吨。据联合国环境规划署估计，二氧化碳的释放量到2050年还将增加一倍。这种气体主要来自矿物燃料（煤、石油和天然气）的燃烧。全世界以矿物燃料作动力的工厂和发电站以及机动车辆数不胜数，它们排放的废气是大气中二氧化碳的主要来源。
    此外，由于现代社会大量使用冰箱、空调以及制造塑料和清洗电子元件，每年向大气释放的氯氟烃也多达70万吨。
