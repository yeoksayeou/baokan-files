Throughout this year, the Changyuan County Committee in Henan Province has organized the entire county's cadres and masses to carry out the "Two Learnings and One Evaluation" campaign, learning from Jiao Yulu and Lei Feng, and evaluating new people and new deeds. This has promoted the improvement of the county's party style and public morals.

The county committee requires that new people and new deeds that emerge during the activities be collected once a month and evaluated once a quarter. At the end of the year, the county's advanced figures in spiritual civilization are selected, and positive energy is vigorously promoted and new winds are established. Through this activity, 1,470-plus Lei Feng study groups and youth civil service teams have been established in the county's primary and secondary schools and commercial service systems. At the same time, a group of advanced individuals have emerged, including the woman Shi Guizhi who found and returned 500,000 yuan to the owner; the worker Li Denshan who bravely fought a fire and was severely burned; and the fifth-grade student Wu Zhan'en who, disregarding his own safety, rescued a child who had fallen into a well.
