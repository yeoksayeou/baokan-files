    How to Start Building Spiritual Civilization in Rural Areas? Staging in Large Villages and Towns in Cangzhou
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Man and People's Daily reporter Cao Huanrong report: Since 1984, Hebei Province's Cangzhou Region has concentrated its efforts on building civilized large villages and towns, and after five years, nearly half of the 484 large villages and towns in the region have been recognized as "Civilized Villages" at the provincial, regional, and county levels. They have also promoted the spiritual civilization building in the entire rural area. The previously set goal of "small area governance, large area radiation" is beginning to be realized.

    How to start building spiritual civilization in rural areas? In the second half of 1984, the regional party committee and administrative office, based on extensive investigations and research, proposed the goal of "creating civilized large villages and towns." These large villages and towns generally have a fixed population of over 1,500 people. They have always been the transportation hubs and marketplaces for rural areas. In recent years, with the development of the commodity economy, the population on market days can reach tens of thousands. These areas are the high-incidence regions for "six evils" and various accidents. Large villages and towns are mostly the locations of township government offices and are also cultural and educational centers. The spiritual civilization in this small area has a significant impact on the surrounding villages.

    Over the past five years, the Cangzhou regional party committee and administrative office have annually summarized, inspected, and exchanged experiences in building civilized villages and towns. This year, the region is focusing on 10 demonstration large villages and towns, and each county and city is focusing on 3 to 5, ensuring that there are examples to learn from in coastal, inland, poor, and rich areas. The regional party committee and administrative office have dispatched 27 department-level cadres to take charge of specific points and construction. They have also established files for civilized large villages and towns at all levels to implement continuous classified guidance.

    The proposal of the goal of building civilized large villages and towns has found a new approach to rural spiritual civilization building. The regional, county, and township (town) cadres, who are responsible for "block management," have focused on key areas; the "seven stations and eight offices," which are responsible for "line management," have also formed a joint force. Everyone is singing the same tune, and the effect is different. For example, Huanghua City has always insisted on fighting a "total war" around the construction of civilized large villages and towns. After determining a point, the organizational department is responsible for strengthening and improving the leadership; the tax and commercial departments regulate the market order; the civil affairs department assists farmers in establishing "red and white affairs committees" to promote funeral reforms and new wedding practices; the urban construction department assists with planning; the military affairs department engages in "joint construction," and so on. Various activities organized by departments are first carried out in large villages and towns.

    Currently, the large villages and towns in Cangzhou Region have significantly taken the lead in the "two civilizations" building in rural areas. Large villages and towns account for only 10% of the total number of villages in the region, but they have completed over 20% of the various economic indicators for the entire region. The enrollment and retention rates of primary and secondary school students are both above 95%. More than 90% of the large villages and towns have systematically improved the social environment based on their local conditions. These changes have attracted surrounding villages and towns, and their radiation effect is becoming increasingly significant.

    农村精神文明建设从何入手？
    沧州地区抓大村镇带动四周
    本报讯　新华社记者王满、本报记者曹焕荣报道：河北省沧州地区集中力量建设文明大村镇，一抓就是5年。目前，全地区484个大村镇已有近一半分别成为省、地、县表彰的“文明村”，并带动整个农村的精神文明建设。预先制订的“小区域治理，大范围辐射”的目标开始实现。
    农村精神文明建设从何入手？1984年下半年，地委、行署在广泛调查研究的基础上，提出了“创建文明大村镇”的目标。这些大村镇的固定人口，一般都在1500人以上，历来是农村交通枢纽和集贸交易场所，近年随着商品经济的发展，集日上市人口可达数万，是“六害”及各种事故的多发地区。大村镇大都是乡镇机关所在地，也是文化教育中心。这个小区域的精神文明搞得好不好，对周围村庄有着举足轻重的影响。
    5年来，沧州地委、行署每年都要总结、检查、交流文明村镇建设的经验。地区今年抓10个示范大村镇，各县、市每年抓了3至5个，使沿海、内地、穷村、富镇都有榜样可学。地委、行署先后派出27名局级干部包点包建，还层层建立文明大村镇档案，实施连续的分类指导。
    建设文明大村镇目标的提出，使农村精神文明建设找到了新途径。属于“块块”的地区、县、乡（镇）干部，抓住了重点；属于“条条”的“七站八所”，也形成了合力，大家“同唱一台戏”，效果就不一样了。例如，黄骅市始终坚持围绕文明大村镇建设打“总体战”。确定一个点后，组织部门负责抓班子的充实与提高；税务、工商部门整顿集市秩序；民政部门协助农民设立“红白理事会”，推动殡葬改革、婚事新办；城建部门配合搞规划；人武部门搞“共建”，等等。各部门组织的一些活动，也首先在大村镇展开。
    目前，沧州地区的大村镇在农村“两个文明”建设中已明显地领先一步。大村镇只占全地区总村数的10％，完成的各项经济指标却占全地区的20％以上。中小学生的入学率、巩固率均在95％以上。90％的大村镇都从本地实际出发，对社会环境进行了较系统的治理。这些变化，吸引着四周村镇，其辐射作用越来越大。
