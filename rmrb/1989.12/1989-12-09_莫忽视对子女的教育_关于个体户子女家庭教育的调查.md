Recently, the author, along with relevant department officials, conducted a key investigation into the cultural education and family education of individual household children in the urban area of Baoji, Shaanxi. Simultaneously, visits were made to six schools to understand the learning and performance of hundreds of individual household children. The results show that among individual households, there is a widespread problem of focusing solely on business and making money while seriously neglecting the cultural knowledge learning and family education of their children. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

First, there is a mistaken notion of valuing money over education and wealth over talent. A second-grade student from a family of individual householders in New Citizen Road Primary School frequently arrives late, leaves early, skips classes, and fails exams, resulting in poor academic performance. The class teacher has repeatedly informed the student's parents, hoping they would cooperate with the school to help the child catch up. However, the parents told the teacher, "It doesn't matter if my child studies well or poorly. As long as someone keeps an eye on him and he doesn't get into trouble, we don't expect him to go to college. The money I earn is more than enough for him to spend in a lifetime." Additionally, many individual householders work from early morning to late evening, busy with their business, and have no time to care about their children's studies and education. Some individual householders leave their children in the care of elderly relatives for extended periods. If the elderly cannot manage, the children are left to their own devices, ultimately leading to poor performance in school, even skipping classes or dropping out. Some parents even have their children help with the business after school, affecting their studies. Many individual householders do not pay any attention to their children's studies, leading to the habit of not doing homework. According to a survey of nearly 10 schools in Jin Tai and Wei Bin districts, most students from individual household families frequently do not complete their homework. Teachers' feedback to parents is ineffective. Therefore, in these schools, more than 80% of the students with poor grades and behavior are children of individual householders.

Second, using money to replace education. During the survey, many individual householders believe that as parents, their main responsibility is to take care of their children's living needs. As long as there is money, everything will be fine. Whether or not their children can learn cultural knowledge is the school's responsibility. During the survey in several schools in Jin Tai and Wei Bin districts, teachers generally reflected that individual household children each have a few to several dozen yuan in pocket money daily. A first-grade student in New Citizen Road Primary School this year told the teacher and the author, "My parents run a store, and they earn a lot of money. They give me 10 yuan in pocket money every day." These students, with money in hand, not only develop the habit of spending lavishly from a young age but also pick up many bad habits. For example, some start smoking and drinking at a young age; some frequently bring friends to canteens and restaurants to eat and drink; and some, at the age of 11 or 12, start dating and finding girlfriends.

Third, failing to set a good example for their children. Some individual householders, after having money, squander it recklessly and even engage in illegal activities. Children, influenced by their parents' bad behavior, blindly imitate them. Over time, they become unmotivated, their studies deteriorate, and some even become corrupt and engage in criminal activities. Information from educational and public security departments indicates that in recent years, most of the students who have dropped out of school and youth criminals come from individual household families. Additionally, some individual householders with low education levels, even illiterates, set low standards for their children. They tell their children, "As long as you can recognize a few characters and know money, that's enough. Look at us; we have low education, but we still make a lot of money and become millionaires." Under this misguided influence, these children do not study well in school, wander around, and teachers cannot manage them. According to the survey, in the past two years, six primary schools in Jin Tai and Wei Bin districts have had more than 30 students who only attended up to the fourth or fifth grade before dropping out to help their parents with business.

In response to the above situation, officials from relevant departments such as education, industry and commerce, women's federation, public security, and youth education believe that the problem of individual householders focusing solely on making money while neglecting their children's cultural knowledge learning and family education is somewhat universal and exists to varying degrees in different places. Currently, the number of individual households nationwide has reached several million. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay high attention to this issue.

    莫忽视对子女的教育
    ——关于个体户子女家庭教育的调查
    云献科　冯静
    最近以来，笔者会同有关部门的同志，就个体户子女的文化学习和家庭教育问题，在陕西宝鸡市区重点调查了百户个体户。同时，走访了6所学校的部分老师，了解了数百名个体户子女在校学习和表现情况。结果表明：在个体户中，普遍存在只顾做生意赚钱，而严重忽视子女文化知识学习和家庭教育的问题。主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一是思想上存在重挣钱、轻教育，重钱财、轻人才的错误认识。新民路小学二年级一班一名个体户的孩子，经常迟到早退，旷课逃学，考试不及格，学习成绩很差。班主任老师多次向学生家长反映，希望家长能配合学校教育，让孩子迎头赶上。可家长却对老师说：“我娃学好学坏不要紧，只要有人看住他不出事就行，我们不指望他长大考大学，我挣的钱他一辈子也花不完。”另外，许多个体户早出晚归，整天忙于做生意，根本无暇过问子女的学习和教育。有的个体户把子女长期交给老人代管，老人若管不了，就放任自流，最后导致在学校不好好学习，表现差，甚至逃学、辍学；有的学生家长还让孩子一放学，就帮大人看摊做买卖，影响学业。许多个体户对子女的学习根本不闻不问，使子女养成长期不做家庭作业的坏习惯。据对金台、渭滨区近10所学校的调查，个体户家庭的学生多数经常不做家庭作业，老师向家长反映也无济于事。因而，在这些学校成绩差、表现不好的学生中，80％以上是个体户的子女。
    二是以金钱代替教育。调查中，许多个体户认为：作为孩子家长，抚育子女成长的主要义务是生活上关照好，只要有钱，啥事都好办。至于能否学好文化知识，那是学校的事。笔者在金台、渭滨区的几所学校调查时，老师普遍反映说：个体户子女每人每天手中的零花钱少则几元，多的二三十元。新民路小学一个今年刚上一年级的学生对老师和笔者说：“我爸爸妈妈开商店，挣的钱可多呢，他们每天给我10元零花钱。”这些学生手中有了钱，不仅从小养成花钱大手大脚的毛病，而且，还沾染了许多坏习气。例如：有的从小就学会了抽烟喝酒；有的经常领上小伙伴进食堂、酒馆吃喝；还有的年龄只有十一二岁，就开始恋爱，找女朋友。
    三是自身不能为子女作表率。有些个体户手中有钱后，便大肆挥霍，甚至违法乱纪。子女对家长的不良行为耳濡目染，盲目仿效，积以时日，也就不思上进，学习退步，甚至腐化堕落，走上犯罪道路。教育和公安部门提供的一些情况表明，近年来，城镇学校辍学的学生和犯罪青少年，大多数的家庭是个体户。另外，还有一些文化程度低、甚至是文盲的个体户低标准要求子女。他们竟然对子女说：你只要能识几个字，认得钱就行，别看我们文化低，就是没文化也照样挣大钱，成万元户。正是在这种错误的现身说法引导下，这些孩子在学校根本不好好学习，游游逛逛，老师也管教不了。经调查了解，金台、渭滨区的6所小学，近两年就有30多名学生只上到四五年级，就休学随父母经商。
    针对以上情况，教育、工商、妇联、公安、少儿教育等有关部门的同志认为：个体户中存在的只顾挣钱，忽视子女学习文化知识和家庭教育的问题，带有一定的普遍性，各地都程度不同地存在。目前，全国的个体户已发展到数千万户，希望有关部门能对这一问题引起高度重视。
