	Wuwei is also known as Liangzhou. Historically, it has been renowned for its prosperity, with the saying "seven li, ten million households" and the reputation of "Liangzhou's literary culture leading Qin and Long." The copper galloping horse, now a symbol of Chinese tourism, was designed based on the Western Han bronze "Horse Trampling a Goose" unearthed in Wuwei.

	The people of Wuwei have also replicated a multi-ton "Horse Trampling a Goose" statue, standing tall in the center of the newly built city cultural square. This serves to showcase the brilliance of their hometown's ancient culture and to commemorate the grand ambition of building their hometown today.

	When it comes to urban construction, Wuwei stands out among the "Four Counties of Hexi." The city's neatly arranged streets intersect, and new commercial, hospital, and educational buildings have transformed the old appearance of Wuwei.

	The urban and rural population of Wuwei City has reached 820,000, making it the largest county-level city in the western provinces and regions. The Wuwei oasis, which supports so many people, has not only sustained them but has also become a major contributor of commercial grain to the state in recent years, a remarkable achievement. The abundance of Wuwei's grain reserves is due to the water conservancy projects and efficient water use since liberation. Wuwei is part of the Shiyang River system. Its annual average precipitation is only 160 millimeters, while the evaporation rate is over 2000 millimeters. The snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains is the primary source of water for agriculture. Ten years ago, the reporter followed Wuwei's water management expert Liu Erneng to visit the irrigation network here. The stone-built main canals, branch canals, and irrigation ditches crisscrossed the fields, and the tree belts along the canals were lush. The shimmering snowmelt water flowed like silver threads, wrapping around the green crops of the oasis. Before liberation, however, Wuwei residents often fought over water, leading to destruction and deaths. "The mere mention of water caused fear" was a common ailment here.

	Of course, the most significant increase in grain production in Wuwei has been in the past ten years, with policies that have unleashed the enthusiasm and intelligence of farmers. In Wutong Village, there is a farmer named Liu Quanguang who used the by-products of deep-processing agricultural products to develop animal husbandry. He then used the income and organic fertilizer from animal husbandry to promote high-yield grain production, creating a virtuous cycle. He is known as the "Ph.D. of rural economics."

	Now, Wuwei's grain yield per unit area has increased from 87 kilograms in 1950 to 337 kilograms in 1988. The amount of commercial grain sold to the state increased from 75,000 tons in 1978 to 130,000 tons in 1988. This year marks Wuwei City's 12th consecutive year of bumper harvests.

    武威城里话丰年
    ——“河西四郡”采访札记之四
    本报记者　张述圣　新华社记者　曹永安
    武威又称凉州。历史上曾有过“七里十万家”之盛，“凉州文风甲秦陇”之誉。
    现在作为中国旅游标志的铜奔马，就是依照武威出土的西汉铜铸“马踏飞燕”的造型而设计的。
    武威人还复制了一尊数吨重的“马踏飞燕”高耸于新建的市文化广场中央，一显自己家乡古文化的灿烂，二铭今天建设家乡的宏伟志愿。
    要说城市建设，“河西四郡”中武威当首屈一指了。整齐的街道纵横交错，一幢幢新的商业、医院和教学大楼，使整个武威的市容改变了旧的模样。
    武威市的城乡人口已达82万之众，是西北诸省、区中最大的县级市。而赖于生存的武威绿洲，在养活了这么多的人之外，近些年居然成了向国家交售商品粮的大户，的确是个了不起的成就。武威粮仓的丰裕，取决于解放后的兴修水利、用水有方。武威属石羊河水系。其年均降水量仅160毫米，蒸发量高达2000多毫米，祁连山的雪水为农业用水的主要来源。10年前，记者曾跟随武威的治水专家刘尔能，踏访过这里的灌溉网络。平畴阡陌中，石砌的干渠、支渠、斗渠如织，渠边的林带如织。荡漾着碧波的雪水银线线似缠绕着绿洲嘉禾。而在解放前，武威人为争水发生械斗，家破人亡时有发生。“谈水色变”，是这里的旧病。
    当然，武威粮食增产幅度最大的是近10年，政策将种粮人的积极性、聪明才智发挥出来了。梧桐村有个叫刘全国的农民，他靠农产品深度加工的下脚料发展养殖业，又靠养殖业所得的资金和有机肥料来促进粮食高产，出现了良性循环，被誉为“农村经济学博士”。
    现在武威的粮食单产已由1950年的87公斤增至1988年的337公斤。向国家交售商品粮1978年7.5万吨；1988年13万吨。今年是武威市的连续第12个丰收年。
