Beijing researchers have proven that Tibetans are an integral part of the Chinese nation. Researchers from the Beijing Pediatric Research Institute used different types of human leukocyte antigen sera to test 233 randomly sampled Tibetans of pure Tibetan ancestry from Lhasa and Shigatse in Tibet. They found that the Tibetan people are a group that migrated south from the southern part of Gansu Province and Qinghai Province and were blocked by the Himalayas, forming an inseparable part of the Chinese nation.

Due to differences in customs, habits, language, and clothing between Tibetans and the Han people and other ethnic minorities in inland China, there has been controversy over the origin of Tibetans. Although there is strong historical evidence proving that Tibet has always been part of China, some separatists have used international anti-China forces to claim that Tibet is an independent territory and that Tibetans have no blood ties with the Han people.

Human leukocyte antigens are currently the most complex genetic markers found in the human body. Researchers from the Beijing Pediatric Research Institute studied the genetic characteristics of human leukocyte antigens in Tibetans and compared the results with samples from 18 regions across the country and data on human leukocyte antigens from Nepal and India. They found that the leukocyte antigens of Tibetans match those of the northern Chinese population, while they are significantly different from those of Nepal and India. This genetic and immunological evidence reveals the origin of the Tibetan people.

    北京科研人员证明
    藏族是中华民族一部分
    新华社北京十二月二十七日电（记者朱玉）北京儿科研究所的研究人员利用人类白细胞抗原不同型别血清，对西藏拉萨和日喀则两地区随机抽样的二百三十三名纯藏族血统的藏民检测后发现：藏族系我国甘肃南部及青海地区人群南迁而受喜马拉雅山阻隔形成的一个民族，是中华民族大家庭中不可分割的一部分。
    由于藏民民族风俗、习惯、语言、服饰与内地汉族及其他少数民族不尽相同，因而对于藏民的来源素有争议。尽管有强有力的历史证据证明西藏一直是中国的领土，然而少数分裂主义者却利用国际反华势力，声称西藏是独立版土，藏民与汉族无血缘关系。
    人类白细胞抗原是目前发现的人体最复杂的遗传标志，北京儿科研究所的研究人员研究了人类白细胞抗原在藏民中的遗传特点，并与全国十八个地区的人群抽样调查结果和尼泊尔、印度的人类白细胞抗原数据相比较，发现藏民的白细胞抗原与中华民族北方人群的白细胞抗原相符合，而与尼泊尔、印度的相去甚远，从而用遗传免疫学手段揭示了藏族的民族起源问题。
