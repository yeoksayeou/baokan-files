A U.S. court on December 12 sentenced Leona Helmsley, who ranks among the world's richest, to prison and a fine for evading personal income tax.

Federal District Judge John Walker in a New York Manhattan court sentenced Helmsley to four years in prison and a fine of $8.8 million.

The 69-year-old Leona Helmsley is a hotel industry tycoon with a net worth of $10 billion. Currently, she personally owns $50 billion in real estate, including 27 hotels and the Empire State Building in New York. She evaded $1.2 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985 by listing personal expenses as business expenses.

Her 80-year-old husband, Harry Helmsley, was also indicted, but prosecutors found him mentally unfit and dropped the charges against him.
