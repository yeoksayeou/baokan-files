    The Ministry of Commerce has proposed objectives for rectification and order in grain work during the period of rectification and order, emphasizing the need to stabilize the grain situation as a top priority. Hu Ping, the Minister of Commerce, outlined the preliminary thoughts on the objectives for rectification and order in grain work at the national grain work conference that concluded today.

    Hu Ping stated that over the next three years or more, the objectives for rectification and order in grain work are to stabilize the grain situation, develop grain production, and prepare for a few years of tight conditions. The goals include gradually improving the grain purchase and sales relationship, reforming the "three-link" policy, and improving the relationship between the state and farmers. From the perspective of China's national conditions and grain situation, it is necessary to strengthen the planned management and appropriate concentration of grain. Control the rapid growth of consumption demand, ensure that grain does not face major issues, rectify the circulation order, and give full play to the leading role of state-owned grain commerce. Gradually establish a macro-control system that combines planned economy with market regulation, improve grain market regulation, maintain basic stability in market grain prices, and perfect enterprise reforms. Further mobilize the enthusiasm of a wide range of grain workers and staff.

    Hu Ping believes that during the period of rectification and order, the contract procurement tasks should remain stable. To achieve the above objectives and balance the state's grain income and expenditure, efforts should be made to reduce sales. He said that for the next two years, an active attitude should be taken towards reducing the sales of subsidized grain. Local authorities should make decisions based on the deployment of the State Council and their own actual situations. Once a decision is made, they should act promptly to reduce sales.

    商业部提出粮食工作治理整顿目标
    理顺粮食购销关系  控制消费过快增长
    本报北京12月2日讯　记者潘岗报道：治理整顿期间，粮食工作要把稳定粮食局势作为头等大事抓紧抓好。商业部部长胡平在今天结束的全国粮食工作会议上，提出了粮食工作治理整顿目标的初步设想。
    胡平说，在三年或者更长一些时间内，粮食工作治理整顿的目标是，从稳定粮食局势出发，在发展粮食生产和坚持过几年紧日子的基础上，逐步理顺粮食购销关系，改进“三挂钩”政策，改善国家同农民的关系；从我国国情和粮情出发，加强粮食的计划管理和适度集中；控制消费需求的过快增长，保证粮食不出大问题；整顿好流通秩序，发挥国营粮食商业主渠道的主导作用，逐步建立符合计划经济与市场调节相结合原则的宏观调控体系，搞好粮食的市场调节，保持市场粮价基本稳定；完善企业改革，进一步调动广大粮食干部职工的积极性。
    胡平认为，在治理整顿期间，合同定购任务要稳定。要实现以上目标，平衡国家粮食收支，要从压缩销售上找出路。他说，明后两年对压缩平价粮的销售要持积极态度。各地要根据国务院的部署，结合自己实际情况作出决策。只要看准了的，就应当早下决心，积极压缩销售。
