The tumultuous 1980s will be history in just 100 days. On this day, the autumn sky is clear, the clouds are light, and the sun is bright with a refreshing breeze.

At the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, on the Luohu Bridge, amidst the tens of thousands of hurried footsteps entering the country, he stood before the stern and imposing officials of the Shenzhen border inspection station and the Kowloon Marine Police, his heart pounding, legs trembling slightly, face flushed, and silent. After the verification and clearance, he stepped out of the grand and majestic joint inspection building into the blue sky, white clouds, tall buildings, and bustling crowds.

Ah! Shenzhen.

With a "click," he pressed the shutter, capturing the magnificent and towering buildings in the "COTAI" area. Then, he took out a few photos from his suit pocket and, comparing them with his Hong Kong friend who accompanied him across the border, repeatedly said, "If you don't come and see it for yourself, you'd really think these photos were taken in Hong Kong or Gaoxiong."

It turned out that his friend had gone ahead to Taiwan and toured the mainland thoroughly, leaving Shenzhen to return to Taiwan, writing a lengthy travelogue of ten thousand words with accompanying photos. However, the old editor at the newspaper doubted the photos of Shenzhen, insisting that the mainland could not have such a bustling and prosperous place. He, entrusted by his friend and the newspaper, took the opportunity of his return home to visit relatives to personally verify and take additional photos.

The island of Taiwan, isolated in the vast ocean for nearly 40 years, finally opened a small gap for exchange in the late 1980s under the impact of the global wave of openness. This allowed the islanders, who were almost driven crazy by confinement, and the Taiwanese veterans stranded on the mainland, to cross the sea in their twilight years to return home to pay respects to their ancestors, visit relatives, reunite, sightsee, and travel. They experienced the joy of family reunions and felt the vastness of the motherland and the profoundness of Chinese culture and history. In an instant, the people of Taiwan, who knew nothing about the mainland, continuously stirred up waves of "returning to the mainland" fervor on the small island. They wanted authentic mainland delicacies like shiitake mushrooms, red dates, and hairy crabs. They wanted genuine mainland medicinal herbs like Radix Astragali and Codonopsis. They wanted famous brands like Maotai, Wuliangye, Dukang, and Shaoxing wine. They wanted original mainland scenery, movies like "Xi'an Incident," "The Well," and "Red Sorghum." They wanted to listen to Chinese opera, folk songs, and hometown accents performed by mainland artists. Taiwanese people took pride in owning a calligraphy or painting by a mainland master; receiving a letter from home was like a treasure, with tears falling over every word, and they could read it a hundred times without tiring.

Shenzhen, in the process of China's reform and opening up, has, after nearly 10 years of construction, shone like a jewel on the window of the motherland, attracting countless Taiwanese compatriots. After repeated comparisons, they made up their minds to invest their lifelong business efforts, profits, development achievements, and results in this sacred land, feeling at ease and sincere.

The Taiwanese visitor, who was once nervous and trembling, now walks briskly and excitedly through the special economic zone city, carrying out his "verification" and photography.

His lens focused on people withdrawing money from the automated teller machines at the bank on the roadside of Nanyang Building. He wanted to tell the people of Taiwan that the international financial community had entered the special economic zone market.

He aimed his lens at the street signs for "Taiwanese Singer Concerts," the Bo Ya Art Gallery, and the sales advertisements for cassette tapes and records, showing great interest: "After all, art knows no borders."

In front of the plastic film production line controlled by computers and the colorful toy assembly line invested by Taiwanese businessmen, his flashbulb kept flashing. To his surprise, several cargo trucks from Taiwan were parked at the factory gate.

"Hey, this photo can't be taken," he suddenly realized, muttering to himself.

At night, he encountered a Taiwanese girl and a retired general in a hotel. The Taiwanese girl had just celebrated her birthday with friends at a nightclub in a resort, dancing wildly and still showing traces of makeup and jewelry on her face. It was said that the old soldier, listening to a sad and moving hometown folk song at a concert in the gymnasium, was reminded of old times and couldn't help but shed tears, almost fainting in his chair.

Listening to this, he couldn't help but dial an international call to Taiwan. In less than 15 minutes, the call went through, with a strong current and loud voice. He stammered and became emotional to his wife:

"I'm in Shenzhen... everything is going smoothly. It's very safe. It's very pleasant... everything is beyond imagination, everything is..."

    释疑
    廖虹雷
    风云激荡的80年代，还差100天，就将成为历史的过去。这天，秋高云淡，日丽风爽。
    香港——深圳之边境罗湖桥，上万双匆匆入境的脚步中，他在陌生而威严的深圳边防检查站和九龙海关官员面前，心遽跳，腿微颤，脸红，不语。验证，过关。一出庄严巍峨的联检大楼，蓝天。白云。大厦。人流。
    啊！深圳。
    “咔嚓”一声，他按下了快门，摄下了“国贸”一带华丽、高耸的建筑群。然后掏出西装里袋的几幅照片，对着陪同他过境的香港朋友，反复比对着说：“不来看一看，倒真的以为这照片是拍自香港或高雄的了。”
    原来，他的朋友先行一步，从台湾到内地认真兜了一圈，经深圳出境返台，写了洋洋万言游记，配上照片。谁知报馆老编竟然对深圳的几幅照片质疑，硬说大陆不可能有这么繁华热闹的地方。他，就是受朋友和报馆之托，趁回乡探亲之机，实地考证和补拍照片来了。
    孤悬于滔滔大海足有40年的台湾岛，终于在20世纪80年代末那世界性开放浪潮的冲击下，逐步启开了一道交流的门缝，让几乎被困囿得发疯的岛民和滞留在大陆的台湾老兵，在风烛残年之际，渡海回乡祭祖、探亲、团聚、观光、旅游，体味人间团圆的天伦之乐，领略祖国怀抱的博大和中华民族文化历史之悠远。转瞬间，对大陆一无所知的骨肉同胞，在小小的宝岛上，持续掀起了一股股“回大陆热潮”。吃的要地道的大陆香菇、红枣、大闸蟹，喝的要正宗大陆的党参、黄芪药材汤，饮的要名牌茅台、五粮液、杜康、绍兴酒，看的要原版大陆风光、《西安事变》、《老井》、《红高粱》影视带，听的要大陆演奏的中国京剧、民歌、乡音，台湾人以得到一幅大陆名家字画为荣耀；收到一封家信如珍宝，字句垂泪，百读难厌。世界上只有亲情，才像酿酒一样，时间愈远久而愈发香醇浓郁。
    深圳，在祖国开放和改革中，经过近10年的建设，如明珠一样在祖国的窗台上闪闪发亮，吸引着无数的台胞。他们经过反复的比较，痛下决心，把半生的经营心血，盈利积累，开发成果，投注在这块神圣大地，却感到心安理得，心底坦实。
    奔忙在特区都市里那位原先心跳脚颤的台湾来客，现在却心情兴奋，脚步轻盈地进行他的“考证”和猎影。
    他的镜头对准在南洋大厦马路边银行电脑自动提款窗提款的路人。他要告诉台湾市民，国际金融界已进入了特区市场。
    他把镜头对着“台湾歌星演唱会”街招和博雅画廊和唱带、唱片售销广告，兴趣甚浓：“毕竟艺术无界域啊。”
    在台商投资的电脑控制的塑胶膜生产线和色彩绚丽的玩具厂流水线前，他的镁光灯闪个不停。令他甚感意外的，厂门口竟然停有好几辆台湾来的货柜车。
    “嗳，这个照片拍不得。”他猛然醒悟，自言自语。
    入夜，他在酒店巧遇台湾一位小姐和一位退役将军。台湾小姐刚刚和朋友在一个度假村夜总会过了生日，狂舞尽欢，脸上的妆和身上的饰品还未退下来，显得兴味犹存。据说，老军人在体育馆听到演唱会里一曲悲壮的令人回肠荡气的故乡民歌，勾起往事，不禁老泪纵横，几乎昏倒在椅子上。
    他听着听着，按捺不住往台湾挂拨程控电话。不到15分钟，越洋电话挂通了，电流很强，声音很响。他对着太太突然口吃、动情起来：
    “我在深圳……很顺利。很安全。很愉快。……一切都想象不到，一切都……”
