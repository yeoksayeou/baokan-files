    Anti-Gambling Poem
    It is said that in ancient times, there was an elderly scholar who, upon learning that his only son had developed a gambling addiction, wrote a deeply meaningful anti-gambling poem: “Bei is a person, not a person, only because of today’s Bei the root of disaster, one day if Bei is divided, in the end, it becomes a Bei soldier.” The son, who was addicted to gambling, read it and pondered over it but could not understand its meaning. The old father then patiently explained: Bei combined is “gambling,” today’s Bei combined is “greed,” divided Bei combined is “poverty,” Bei soldier combined is “thief.” These four characters, gambling, greed, poverty, and thief, are the inevitable outcomes for every gambler. The son suddenly realized his mistake and from then on, he quit gambling and never gambled again.

    This poem, which uses the combination of characters to warn against gambling, still has educational significance today. I advise you to read it, and you will surely benefit greatly.

    戒赌诗
    相传，古代有位做文章的老者，得悉唯一的儿子染上了赌博恶习，便寓意深刻地写了一首别具一格的戒赌诗：“贝者是人不是人，只为今贝起祸根，有朝一日分贝了，到头成为贝戎人。”嗜赌成瘾的儿子看罢，百思不得其意，老父便耐心一一点破：贝者合为“赌”，今贝合为“贪”，分贝合为“贫”，贝戎戎合为“贼”。这赌、贪、贫、贼四个字，便是每个赌徒必然下场。儿子幡然醒悟，从此洗手，再也不赌了。
    这首运用文字组合的戒赌诗，今日仍有教育意义，劝君一读，定会受益匪浅。
