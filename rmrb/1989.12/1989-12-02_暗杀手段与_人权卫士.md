Not long after the failed coup in Panama, some American political figures, including certain members of Congress, criticized the government's handling of the Panama issue. They accused the government of not fully utilizing the situation to oust the Panamanian leaders or completely eliminate them to fulfill America's long-standing wishes. Facing various accusations and interrogations, high-ranking government officials and CIA officials stumbled over their words, seemingly having something difficult to explain. In their defenses, there was a kind of complaint: as if a presidential order that had been in effect for 13 years had tied their hands.

The so-called presidential order refers to a directive issued by then-U.S. President Ford in 1976. At that time, during a congressional hearing, someone exposed the CIA's plot to assassinate foreign leaders. In fact, this was a common occurrence in U.S. foreign intelligence activities. Because this time it was exposed, it involved a scandal that made the president embarrassed. Thus, Ford issued an order: "No one shall be employed by the United States or act in the name of the United States to engage in or plan assassination activities." However, the facts show that this was merely a cover-up, a mere formality that could not restrain those who, for the sake of American interests, would overthrow other countries at will.

In fact, American and other Western media have already revealed a large amount of information about the CIA's involvement in military coups in Panama.

The November 16 issue of the Los Angeles Times revealed that the U.S. government planned to spend $3 million on a secret operation codenamed "Panama 5," aiming to kidnap or assassinate military and political leaders such as Noriega. High-ranking CIA officials frankly admitted that the 1976 presidential order did not hinder their plans to assassinate Noriega. Western media recently revealed another intriguing piece of information. At that time, government officials had carefully studied a plan to arrange for the "unintentional" death of foreign leaders disliked by the U.S. due to some American activities. This way, if the matter was exposed and they were indeed held accountable for violating the presidential order, the culprits could escape responsibility, and the U.S. could maintain its reputation for obeying the law.

This is nothing but a case of hiding the truth. The CIA has never needed to disguise its actions. Consider the following:

- In 1984, the U.S. media revealed that the CIA had written a pamphlet titled "Psychological Warfare in Guerrilla Warfare" for Nicaraguan anti-government forces. The book not only taught various sabotage activities but also instructed readers on how to "selectively and systematically assassinate" Nicaraguan government officials.

- In 1985, the CIA directly participated in mining Nicaraguan ports, destroying ships of a sovereign state.

- In 1986, U.S. planes bombed Libya. The bombs fell on the residence of Libyan leader Gaddafi. Gaddafi narrowly escaped.

The CIA's actions are already infamous. What is interesting is that among those who blame the government for not seizing the opportunity to eliminate the Panamanian leaders, there are many who claim to be "human rights guardians." They never say a word about the U.S. intelligence agencies or military authorities sending troops or special agents to other countries to kill people and overthrow governments, acting recklessly and disregarding the sovereignty of other countries. Yet, they hypocritically accuse this country of human rights violations today and blame that country for not respecting human dignity tomorrow. This is indeed a strange phenomenon in today's world.

    暗杀手段与“人权卫士”
    文时平
    巴拿马发生未遂政变以后不久，美国政界人士包括某些国会议员对政府在巴拿马问题上的作为颇有一番责难。他们指责政府未能充分利用当时的局势，把巴拿马领导人一举赶下台，或彻底干掉，以遂美国的宿愿。面对种种指责和盘诘，政府高级官员和中央情报局负责人支吾其词，似有难言之苦。他们辩解中带有这样一种埋怨：似乎有一项执行了13年之久的总统命令束缚了他们的手脚。
    所谓总统命令，是指1976年当时的美国总统福特下达的一项命令。当时在国会听证会上，有人揭露了中央情报局策划暗杀外国领导人的阴谋活动。其实这在美国国外情报活动中是家常便饭。因为这次曝了光，涉及到丑闻使总统难堪。于是福特下了一道手令：“任何人都不得受雇于美国或以美国的名义从事或策划暗杀活动。”但是，事实表明，这不过是一纸此地无银三百两的表面文章，那能捆住那些“为了美国利益”而恣意颠覆别国的人的手脚呢？
    事实上，美国和其他西方国家的新闻媒介早已披露大量美国中央情报局在巴拿马策动军事政变的内情。
    11月16日的《洛杉矶时报》透露，美国政府计划用300万美元执行一项名为“巴拿马5号”的秘密活动，阴谋劫持甚至暗杀诺列加等军政领导人。中央情报局的高级官员就坦率承认，1976年的总统命令根本妨碍不了他们计划暗杀诺列加的阴谋。西方报刊最近还透露出一点耐人寻味的消息。当时，政府官员曾煞费苦心地研究过这样一种计划：安排由于美国人的某种活动“非故意地”导致了美国不喜欢的外国领导人的死亡的那种情况，这样事情一旦败露，如果真的追究起违反总统命令时，既可使责任者逃之夭夭，又可维持美国遵守法令之美名。
    这完全是掩耳盗铃。美国中央情报局干这些勾当从来就不需要装饰门面。请看：
    ——1984年美国新闻界透露，中央情报局为尼加拉瓜反政府武装编写了一本《游击战中的心理战》小册子。书中除了教授各种破坏活动外，还告诉人们，如何“有选择、有计划地暗杀”尼加拉瓜政府官员。
    ——1985年，中央情报局直接参与在尼加拉瓜港口布雷，炸毁一个主权国家的船只。
    ——1986年美国飞机轰炸利比亚。炸弹落到了利比亚领导人卡扎菲的住所。卡扎菲幸免遇难。
    美国中央情报局干的勾当早已臭名昭著。有意思的是，责怪政府没有抓紧时机干掉巴拿马领导者的人中有不少是以“人权卫士”自居的人。他们对于美国情报机关或军事当局任意派军队或特工人员到别的国家去杀人颠覆，胡作非为，根本不把别国的主权放在眼里的做法从来不置一词。可偏偏要装正经地今天指责这个国家侵犯人权，明天责怪那个国家不尊重人的尊严。这实在是当今世界的咄咄怪事。
