Title: Circumventing Land Use Regulations for Housing Construction

In our county, the practice of reporting and approving housing construction sites has become a voluntary action for the vast majority of rural households. Incidents of constructing houses without approval are rare. However, some farmers use indirect methods to occupy land for housing. For dry land, they deliberately abandon cultivation, turning it into wasteland after a few years, and then report it as wasteland to higher authorities. From 1985 to 1988, our county's dry land area decreased by 3,084 mu, with part of it being used for housing construction. For paddy fields, they intentionally stop planting rice and instead plant dry crops, converting paddy fields into dry land, and then report it as dry land to higher authorities.

Circumventing land use regulations for housing construction has significant concealment and deception, making illegal land occupation appear "legal." Various township governments, when approving residential plots, generally approve wasteland and dry land upon reporting, leading to a large amount of arable land being illegally occupied without notice. This should be highly regarded by governments and relevant departments at all levels.

    迂回占地建房
    湖南省祁东县　龙剑平
    我县农村建房基地报批已成为绝大多数农户的自觉行动，不经批准而直接占地建房事件很少发生。但一些农民采用迂回办法占地建房。对旱土，他们故意弃耕抛荒，几年后变成荒地，再以荒地向上申报。一九八五年至一九八八年，我县旱土面积减少三千零八十四亩，其中部分是被建房占用。对水田，他们有意不种水稻而改种旱粮，把水田变成旱土，再以旱土向上申报。
    迂回占地建房，具有很大的隐蔽性和欺骗性，使非法占地披上了“合法”的外衣。各乡镇政府在审批宅基地时，一般对荒地、旱土是申报即批，使大批耕地不知不觉地被非法占用。这应引起各级政府和有关部门高度重视。
