On December 17, a Sunday, at 7 PM, the reporter visited Beijing Agricultural University at the foot of the Yan Mountains. The student union was hosting a "Love My China, Inspire National Spirit" speech contest.

The teaching building was brightly lit. A large classroom with over 200 seats was filled with students. Those who arrived later stood in the aisles and at the door.

"The first speaker is Zhou Huaiwei from the College of Life Sciences," announced the student union's academic department head, Feng Zhongze.

Zhou Huaiwei stepped onto the stage and said, "My topic is 'Fully Understand Our National Conditions.'" He spoke with a serious expression and a strong voice, calmly analyzing our country's conditions, occasionally gesturing with his hands. "We admit that we are behind Western developed countries, but we are not willing to be left behind. The people of the entire nation are carrying forward the spirit of hard work and striving for a moderately prosperous society."

Next, Song Yanning from the College of Agricultural Economics and Management spoke. His topic was "Inspire the Spirit, Welcome the 1990s." Yang Jun, a first-year student in the Applied Agriculture Department and a radio station announcer, said, "Loving the country cannot stop at words; it must be shown through actions. Currently, the country is undergoing reforms. How can we hesitate in the face of difficulties?"

Wang Jianmin's speech received the most applause and the highest score, 9.94 points from the six-member judging panel. Wang is 24 years old and currently a graduate student in the Horticulture Department. He spoke about stories from the Taihang Mountains, illustrating the struggle and transformation between poverty and wealth, superstition and science in rural areas. He said, "I sincerely hope that everyone, including myself, can get close to the times, get close to the laboring people who give us courage and wisdom and support our education. Let's do something practical for them."

Around 9 PM, when the speech contest ended, Vice President Li Qingshan spoke, "This speech contest has inspired me. It reminded me of the scene 34 years ago in the Zhongnanhai's Huairen Hall, where I watched a play with Premier Zhou Enlai. The Premier said, 'The youth of today are the masters of the times.'"

Vice President Li also dedicated the new school anthem to the speech contest:

"Love our Agricultural University, with a good school spirit,
Hardworking and frugal, rigorous in scholarship,
Inherit fine traditions, unite, be practical, innovate,
Strive to reach the peak of science and technology...
Devote ourselves to agriculture, take pride in agriculture,
We will depict the beautiful scenery of our motherland,
Bring blessings to the people, always in our hearts!"

    夜访北农大
    本报记者　段存章
    十二月十七日，星期天，晚七时。记者来到燕山脚下的北京农业大学。这里的学生会正举办“爱我中华，振奋民族精神”演讲比赛会。
    教学楼灯光明亮。一间有二百多个座位的大教室，坐满了同学。后赶来的，挤站在走道上和门口。
      “第一位演讲的是生物学院周华伟同学”，主持会的学生会学习部部长冯忠泽宣布。
    小周大步走上讲台说：“我讲的题目是：‘充分认识我们的国情’。”他表情严肃，话音有力，冷静地对我国国情进行分析，不时打着手势。“我们承认，比起西方发达国家是落后了，但我们不甘落后，全国人民正发扬苦干精神，向小康水平迈进。”
    接着，农业经济管理学院学生宋亚宁发言，他的题目是：“振奋精神，迎接九十年代。”农学应用系一年级女生杨俊是校广播站播音员，她说：“爱国不能停留在口头上，要用行动。当前国家正在进行改革，我们怎能在困难中裹足不前呢？”
    王健民同学的演讲迎来掌声最多，得分最高。六个人组成的评委给予他九点九四分。小王今年二十四岁，现在是园艺系研究生。他以自己所见所闻讲了发生在太行山区的故事，说明农村贫穷与富裕、迷信与科学的斗争和转化。他说：“我真诚地希望大家，当然也包括我自己，都能够贴近时代，贴近给予我们勇气和智慧、供养我们上学的可爱可敬的劳动人民，为他们扎扎实实地做一点事情。”
    九时左右，演讲比赛结束时，副校长李青山发言说：“这次演讲会使我受到振奋，又一次想起三十四年前在中南海怀仁堂与周恩来总理一起看戏时的情景，总理说，‘当代青年是时代的主人’。”李副校长还把农大新校歌献给演讲会：“……爱我农大，良好校风，艰苦朴素，治学严谨，发扬优良传统，团结、求实、创新，勇攀科技高峰……献身农业，以农为荣，祖国美景，我们描绘，造福人民，牢记心中！”
