    全国短池游泳锦标赛结束
    共打破十四项全国短池游泳纪录
    本报上海12月26日电　“飞跃杯”全国短池游泳锦标赛经过4天竞逐，于今天结束。36块金牌被瓜分，上海获得10块。这次比赛共有9人2队20次打破14项全国短池纪录。
    今天进行的9项比赛破纪录次数最多，女子50米蝶泳上午预赛中，江苏王晓红以28秒71成绩，打破28秒72全国纪录，下午决赛中，她和上海马红妹又分别以28秒18和28秒70打破这项新纪录。江苏林莉和浙江李洁在上午进行的女子200米仰泳中，双双打破2分19秒83全国纪录，下午决赛林莉又以2分17秒18成绩打破她自己上午创下的2分17秒59全国纪录。男子200米蛙泳第一名又被蛙王陈剑虹夺得，他还以2分16秒71成绩打破2分17秒1全国纪录，这是他在本次比赛中第二次敲开全国纪录大门。男子50米蝶泳第一名为沈坚强，成绩为24秒92，女子50米自由泳第一名是北京孙春莅，成绩26秒02，男子100米仰泳第一名徐海泉，成绩58秒78，女子200米自由泳第一名魏红，成绩2分4秒09，男子4×50米混合泳接力名次为上海体校、解放军。男子400米个人混合泳决赛，王大力以4分25秒72成绩打破4分29全国纪录，并获得这个项目第一。
    中国游泳队总教练陈运鹏认为，国家队新老队员在这次比赛中普遍发挥不错，成绩都很理想，黄晓敏今年一直很不景气，参加泛太平洋游泳比赛仅得第4名，200米蛙泳成绩排在世界第13位，但这次比赛她连破2项全国纪录，势头很好。陈剑虹50米、100米蛙泳成绩提高也较大。这次比赛还锻炼了一些新手，像浙江李洁等，成绩都不凡。
