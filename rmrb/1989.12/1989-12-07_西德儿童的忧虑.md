West German children have a relatively rich after-school life, including watching films and television, reading extracurricular books, learning to paint, and singing and dancing. Recently, however, many children's hobbies have changed; they have begun to show concern for peace and environmental issues.

Five-year-old children in kindergartens are involved in cleaning activities; children aged 10 to 15 voluntarily clean up trash in streets and parks, plant trees in the suburbs, and build birdhouses. Some take to the streets to protest against excessive packaging waste, the slaughter of wild animals, and the pollution of the sea and air by harmful substances. They advocate for peace and oppose missiles. They often write to mayors, environmental protection ministers, and the federal chancellor to express their wishes and demands. This year, the environmental protection minister received over 50,000 letters from children. Some children in their letters ask why chemical factories dump harmful substances into the sea and why air pollution is so severe. Some children have voluntarily joined the "Peace Bird" children's organization. This organization was spontaneously established by children with the aim of maintaining peace and a beautiful environment. Recently, a reporter from the _Der Spiegel_ weekly interviewed several members of the "Peace Bird" group. A child named Natzmie said, "I love watching news on TV. Every time I hear about children in the Third World dying from hunger, I feel very sad and want to do something for them, but I feel helpless." Another child, Gwen, said, "I often have the strange feeling of hearing bombs suddenly exploding. After joining the 'Peace Bird,' I finally feel safe." Little Lisa thinks that the environmental pollution in the Federal Republic of Germany is very serious and that politicians have only taken a small step forward on the issue of peace. West German children's advanced concern for social issues is mainly influenced by adults and news information. For this reason, some people advocate that parents should maintain an optimistic attitude about the future in front of children, and news agencies should also consider children when reporting, and not let children think about the problems that adults face too early. However, as long as these social problems continue to exist, it seems that eliminating children's worries and fears is a difficult problem to solve.

    西德儿童的忧虑
    联邦德国儿童的课余生活比较丰富，看影视、阅读课外书籍、学绘画及唱歌跳舞等。近来，不少儿童的业余爱好却有了变化，他们开始对和平和环境问题关心起来。
    5岁的孩子在幼儿园搞卫生；10岁至15岁的儿童主动到街头、公园清扫垃圾，到效外栽培树木、搭鸟窝等；有的上街示威游行，反对繁多的包装垃圾、滥杀野生动物、有害物质污染大海与空气。他们要和平，反对导弹。他们常给市长、环保部长、联邦总理写信反映自己的愿望和要求。今年环保部长共收到5万余封儿童来信。有的儿童在来信中问，为什么化学工厂将有害物质倒入大海？为什么空气污染如此严重？一些儿童还自愿加入了“和平鸟”儿童组织。这一组织是儿童自发成立的，宗旨是为了维护和平和优美的环境。最近，《明镜》周刊记者采访了“和平鸟”的几位成员，一位名叫纳茨米耶的小朋友说，我爱看电视新闻，每当我听到第三世界的儿童因挨饿死亡时，我心里很难过，也想为他们做些什么，可自己却无能为力。另一位叫古温的儿童说，我不时地总有听到炸弹突然爆炸的奇怪感觉。加入“和平鸟”后我才有了安全感。小莉莎觉得联邦德国的环境污染很严重；在和平问题上，政治家只是向前迈出了一小步。联邦德国的儿童超前关心社会问题主要是受成年人以及新闻信息的影响。为此，一些人主张，家长在儿童面前对前途应持乐观态度，新闻机构报道时也应考虑到儿童，不应让儿童过早思考成人所面临的问题，但只要这些社会问题继续存在，要消除儿童的忧虑与恐惧，看来这是一个难以解决的问题。
