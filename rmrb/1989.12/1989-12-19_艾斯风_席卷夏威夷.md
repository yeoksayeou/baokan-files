The United States currently has a variety of popular drugs, including marijuana, heroin, crack, and crank, with marijuana and cocaine being the most prevalent. However, in the state of Hawaii, located in the Pacific Ocean, a new type of drug known as "Ice" has rapidly surpassed marijuana and cocaine in just over four years. It not only dominates the local market but has also begun to spread to the American mainland.

Ice (the English term for "Ice," meaning "ice") is a chemical synthetic substance, methamphetamine, appearing as white, transparent crystals. Unlike other drugs, Ice is not extracted from natural plants such as cannabis leaves, coca leaves, or poppy flowers; it can be produced directly in a laboratory.

Why is Ice so popular in Hawaii? Using this drug is relatively convenient, requiring only a glass pipe and a lighter. A small bag of Ice costs $50, weighing less than 1 gram, though it is slightly more expensive than the same amount of crack, the excitement from one use can last 8 to 24 hours, while crack only lasts 20 to 30 minutes. Currently, Ice users in Hawaii are quite common among Filipino and Korean descendants.

The harm Ice causes to the body far exceeds that of crack. Ice makes people mentally obsessed, aggressive, and ultimately can lead to kidney failure and long-term psychological imbalance. For pregnant women, "Ice babies" suffer more severe damage than "cocaine babies." The Honolulu Police Department estimates that 70% of the domestic disputes that occurred in October this year were related to Ice reactions. According to a mental health center in Hawaii, some drug users still have abnormal body functions two and a half years after quitting Ice.

According to the U.S. News & World Report, the world's largest producers and exporters of Ice are South Korea and Taiwan, and Hawaii's Ice mainly comes from these two regions. This drug was invented by Japan in 1893 and was used by the authorities during World War II to invigorate tired soldiers and ammunition factory workers. It was banned in the 1950s. However, Japan is still the largest market for this drug, and South Korea is estimated to have 130,000 Ice addicts.

In the early 1980s, Ice was introduced to Hawaii from South Korea, led by a local Korean man. This person was sentenced to 25 years in prison by the Hawaii Federal Court in October this year. According to authorities, he sold Ice worth $7.3 million in the past two years.

Hawaii's congressional representatives have begun lobbying the White House to have the area designated as a "high-intensity drug trafficking area," quickly cracking down on various Ice-related criminal activities.

In recent months, the U.S. mainland has uncovered several Ice smuggling cases and is currently investigating a South Korean drug trafficking group that specializes in promoting this highly toxic drug on the mainland. Authorities are concerned that if this "Ice storm" takes root in the United States, the already challenging "war on drugs" will become even more complex and severe.

### “艾斯风”席卷夏威夷

    “艾斯风”席卷夏威夷
    本报记者　仓立德
    美国时下流行的毒品名堂不少，有大麻、海洛因、快克、克兰克等，而以大麻和可卡因居多。但在地处太平洋的夏威夷州，一种被称作“艾斯”的新型毒品，却在短短4年多时间里迅速超过大麻和可卡因，不仅在当地独占鳌头，而且开始向美国大陆蔓延。
    艾斯（即英文Ice，意为“冰”），是化学合成物甲基安非他明的一种，呈白色透明结晶状。与其他毒品不同，艾斯不是由大麻叶、古柯叶或罂粟花等天然植物提炼而成，它可在实验室中直接生产。
    艾斯为何在夏威夷受到青睐？吸食这种毒品较为便捷，只需一个烟斗状的玻璃管及一只打火机便可。艾斯售价50美元一小袋，重量不足1克，虽比同量快克贵些，但吸1次的兴奋期可持续8—24小时，而快克只有20—30分钟。目前，艾斯吸食者在夏威夷的菲律宾裔、朝鲜裔中已相当普遍。
    吸艾斯对身体的危害远远超过快克。艾斯使人精神偏执，举止咄咄逼人，最终可导致肾机能衰竭及心理长期失衡。对孕妇而言，“艾斯胎儿”身心遭到的摧残比“可卡因胎儿”更甚。檀香山市警察局估计，在今年10月份发生的各种夫妻争斗事件中，有70％与艾斯反应有关。据夏威夷一所精神健康中心观察，有些吸毒者在戒掉艾斯两年半后，身体机能仍然失常。
    据美国《新闻周刊》报道，当前世界最大的艾斯制造者和出口者是南朝鲜和台湾，夏威夷的艾斯主要来自这两个地区。这种毒品是日本于1893年发明的，在第二次世界大战中曾被当局用来为疲惫的士兵和弹药厂工人提神，50年代被禁止制造和使用。但目前日本仍是这种毒品的最大市场，南朝鲜估计也有13万艾斯瘾君子。
    80年代初，艾斯由南朝鲜传入夏威夷，牵头人是当地一名南朝鲜裔男子。此人已在今年10月被夏威夷联邦法庭处以25年徒刑。据当局估计，他在过去两年中发售的艾斯，价值达730万美元。
    夏威夷州的国会议员已开始游说白宫，要求联邦政府将当地列为“密集贩毒区”，迅速打击各种艾斯犯罪活动。
    美国大陆近几个月已经破获了数起艾斯走私案，目前正在追查一个专门在大陆推销这种剧毒品的南朝鲜人贩毒集团。当局担心，一旦这股“艾斯风”在美国本土立住脚，困难重重的“扫毒战争”的前景便会更复杂，更严峻。
