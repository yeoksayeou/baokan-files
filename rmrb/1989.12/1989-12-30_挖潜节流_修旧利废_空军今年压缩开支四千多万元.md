The Air Force saved 48.71 million yuan in basic construction, social group purchasing, and administrative expenses in 1989. Compared to last year, social group purchasing power decreased by 11.21 million yuan; the purchase volume of controlled commodities dropped by more than half; consumable expenses decreased by 20.11 million yuan, with various conference and reception fees reduced by over 3.8 million yuan.

At the beginning of this year, the Air Force Logistics Department formulated measures to increase revenue and save costs, clearly regulating the reduction of basic construction scale, controlling social group purchasing power, reducing meetings and documents, and curbing extravagant receptions. Various levels of leadership have taken the strict implementation of these regulations as an important task in building a clean government, leading by example in promoting a frugal and hardworking spirit. The reporter learned from the Air Force Logistics Department that this year, the purchase of controlled commodities approved for purchase were strictly controlled within the prescribed range. For the purchase of non-production items such as small cars, VCRs, and air conditioners, no approvals were granted, saving over 1 million yuan in expenses. The Air Force audit department uncovered 27 million yuan in violations, ensuring that the limited funds are used effectively. Various units also tapped into the potential of their inventories, repaired old equipment, and reused waste materials, totaling 75 million yuan in value, effectively alleviating some of the shortages in funds and supplies.

    挖潜节流　修旧利废
    空军今年压缩开支四千多万元
    新华社北京12月29日电（记者孙茂庆）记者从空军后勤工作会议获悉：1989年空军部队压缩基本建设、社会集团购买和行政经费开支4871万元。与去年相比，社会集团购买力减少1121万元；专控商品购买量下降了一半以上；消耗性经费减少2011万元，其中各种会议费、招待费减少380余万元。
    今年初，空军后勤部针对部队经费开支方面存在的问题，制定了增收节流的措施，对压缩基本建设规模、控制社会集团购买力、减少会议文电、刹住超标准招待等都作出了明确的规定。各级领导干部把严格执行这些规定作为廉政建设的一项重要工作来抓，带头发扬艰苦奋斗的优良作风。记者在空军后勤部了解到，今年经批准购买的专控商品，都严格控制在规定的范围内。对购买非生产用的小轿车、录像机、空调器等高档商品，一律没有批准，仅这几项就减少开支100余万元。空军审计部门查出违纪金额2700万元，保障部队把有限的经费用在“刀刃”上。各部队还挖掘库存潜力，修旧利废，总价值达7500万元，有效地缓解了部分经费、物资供应不足的矛盾。
