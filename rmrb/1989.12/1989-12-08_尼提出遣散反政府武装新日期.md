Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega proposed on December 5 in the capital Managua that the anti-government armed forces stationed in Honduras must be disbanded and return to their country or settle in a third country by December 31.

Ortega said he would raise this proposal at the special summit of the five Central American presidents to be held in San José, Costa Rica, on December 10 and 11.

According to the agreement signed by the heads of the five Central American countries in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in August of this year, the approximately 12,000 Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces stationed in Honduras must return to their country by December 5. Ortega pointed out that since the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces have not yet implemented the above agreement, he advocates an extension, rather than the February deadline next year that the United States hopes for.

    尼提出遣散反政府武装新日期
    尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加五日在首都马那瓜建议，驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的尼加拉瓜反政府武装分子必须在十二月三十一日前遣散回国或者到第三国定居。
    奥尔特加说，他将在十二月十日和十一日在哥斯达黎加首都圣何塞召开的中美洲五国总统特别会议上提出这一建议。
    根据中美洲五国首脑今年八月在洪都拉斯特拉城签署的协议，驻扎在洪境内约一点二万名尼反政府武装分子必须在十二月五日前遣返回国。奥尔特加指出，由于尼反政府武装分子至今未能执行上述协议，因此他主张延期，而不是美国希望的明年二月作为最后遣散日期。
