    据新华社北京12月9日电　（记者赵卫）国家教委新闻发言人今天说，由国家教委承办的今年全国人大代表和政协委员对教育工作的建议、提案到8月底已全部答复完毕，比去年提前了20多天，办案质量也好于往年。
    这位发言人介绍，今年国家教委承办的人大、政协代表对教育工作的建议、提案共501件。所反映的问题基本集中在增加教育经费，提高教师工资待遇，更好地贯彻义务教育法，深化高等教育改革，加强青少年思想政治教育以及完善教育立法等工作方面。承担复办这些建议和提案内容的工作涉及到教委各个司局，同时与中央其他17个部委有业务工作上的联系。国家教委对人大代表、政协委员的提案非常重视。在办理过程中，他们对一般问题不敷衍，对“热点”问题不回避，对一些重要问题还请人大代表、政协委员座谈，或通过电话联系及时征求代表委员对办理工作的意见。
