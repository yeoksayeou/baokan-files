Interest in Mr. Qian Zhongshu is not a phenomenon of the past decade. As early as the 1930s, scholars like Wu Yusheng praised him as someone who "mastered both classical and modern, Eastern and Western literature." During his time at Tsinghua University, Mr. Qian served as the English editor of the *Tsinghua Weekly* and contributed articles to publications such as *Dagongbao's World Trends*. He once collaborated with Wu Han to point out errors in Professor Zhao Wannian's lectures, earning the admiration of the university president, Luo Zhenlun, and others. In the 1940s, Mr. Qian's works were reviewed by scholars like Zheng Chaozong, Yan Jianbi, Zhao Jingshen, Pingxi, Peng Fei, Zhang Yu, Tang Zhi, and Wu Jiu. Among the many erudite contributors to the *Guancha* magazine at that time, Mr. Qian was praised by the editor-in-chief, Chu Anping, as "the most outstanding scholar in literature."

From the 1950s to the 1970s, aside from *Selected and Annotated Songs of the Song Dynasty* being highly praised by Japanese scholar Ogawa Katsura, Hu Shi, and Xia Chengfeng, there were also numerous reminiscences and evaluations of Mr. Qian by overseas scholars such as Zhou Wenhai, Rao Rao, Cao Juren, Mu Longtu, Huang Jundong, Xu Zhen, and Si Wei. Due to the high evaluation of *Fortress Besieged* by Professor C.T. Hsia from the United States, several translations of the book into Western languages were published, spreading Mr. Qian's fame abroad. Scholars in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, such as Hu Hanjun, Mai Bingkun, Qin Xianci, Zhou Jin, Yan Huo, Sima Changfeng, He Zhishao, Tang Yan, Shuijing, Huang Weilang, and Xu Xiu, have all diligently interpreted Mr. Qian and his works. In Taiwan, *World Literary Classics Comprehensive Explanation* and *Contemporary World Novelists Reader* both feature special sections on Qian Zhongshu, and *Seven Works by Qian* have been published. In Europe and America, scholars like Hu Dingbang, Hu Zhide, Mao Guoqian, and Spence in the U.S.; David Hawkes in the U.K.; Edlin in the Soviet Union; Giulio Baffi in Italy; Simon Leys, Robert, Xu Siwei, Wang Lu, and Nicolas Sabouret in France; Mahen Morin in Germany; and Maria Rivas in Spain have all conducted in-depth studies on Qian Zhongshu. Additionally, in Japan, scholars like Huang Pingjian and Zhong Wen have made significant contributions.

Since the 1980s, domestic research on Qian Zhongshu has been gradually developing under the leadership of Mr. Zheng Chaozong. In the field of Qian studies, scholars such as Zhou Zhenfu, Ke Ling, Wu Zhongkuang, and Huang Chang have made unique contributions. According to my statistics, there are currently 305 articles (including university journals) related to and researching Qian studies, with more than two-thirds written by mainland scholars. Even books like *Nanshan Laoren's Self-Compiled Chronicle of the First Fifty Years of His Life*, which are usually not available in libraries, have been unearthed. The publication of the six-volume *Selected Works of Qian Zhongshu on Literature* by Huacheng Publishing House has garnered attention in the publishing industry, and Hong Kong and Taiwan are also handling the reprinting of this book. This shows that Qian Zhongshu studies have indeed become a discipline, just like the publications of *Lu Xun Studies*, *Dream of the Red Chamber Studies*, and *Guo Moruo Studies*. The birth of a specialized journal for Qian studies is a natural development, and it is a welcome event. This issue features analyses of characters in *Fortress Besieged* and *Guanzhai Notes and Buddhist Scriptures* by young and middle-aged scholars, which are particularly valuable academically.

Of course, as a newly established journal, this selection of over 200,000 characters is bound to have some omissions. However, the editors' sincere efforts will be understood by the readers. Comrades Huang Ke and Lu Wenhu have worked tirelessly for this inaugural issue, and those who appreciate Qian's works will not forget them. We hope that this journal, which gathers Qian studies from both home and abroad, will continue to be published, focusing on domestic research, exchanging ideas, and reaching out to the world, developing its unique features, and pushing Qian studies to new heights.

### 喜见《钱钟书研究》创刊

    喜见《钱钟书研究》创刊
    李洪岩
    对钱钟书先生的关注并不是近十年来才有的事。早在三十年代，吴雨僧先生等人就对钱先生有过“新旧中西子竟通”的奖誉。在清华大学学习期间，钱先生是《清华周刊》的英文编辑，并为《大公报·世界思潮》等刊物撰稿，曾同吴晗一起指摘老师赵万里讲课中的错误，甚得校长罗家伦等人的激赏。四十年代，钱先生的著作受到过郑朝宗、阎简弼、赵景深、屏溪、彭斐、张羽、唐湜、无咎等人的评论。在当时《观察》杂志众多好学深思的撰稿人中，钱先生被主编储安平誉为“综合素质最出色的一位治文学的人”。五十到七十年代，除《宋诗选注》受到日人小川环树、胡适和夏丞焘的宏奖权衡外，对钱先生的回忆评论文字，也出现在海外邹文海、饶饶威、曹聚仁、慕容龙图、黄俊东、许振德、丝韦等人笔下。由于美国夏志清教授对《围城》作了极高的评价，导致了好几个西方语种的译本，钱先生在海外的名声遍播盛传。东南亚港台地区的学者如胡汉君、麦炳坤、秦贤次、周锦、彦火、司马长风、何志韶、汤晏、水晶、黄维梁、徐訏等数十人，纷纷对钱先生其人其书苦心疏释。台湾的《世界文学名著总解说》、《当代世界小说家读本》均专列钱钟书，还出版《钱著七种》。欧美国家的钱学真赏，美有胡定邦、胡志德、茅国权、斯本斯；英有大卫·霍克斯；苏有艾德林；意有朱·白佐良；法有西蒙·莱斯、罗贝、薛思微、王鲁、尼可拉·萨布伊；德有马汉茂、莫妮克；西班牙有玛丽亚·里维斯；另外日本有荒井健、中岛长文。可以这样说，海外的钱学研究，早已形成显学之势。
    八十年代以来，国内的钱学研究在郑朝宗先生的带动下，逐渐开展起来。在钱学研究中，一批尊师学者如周振甫、柯灵、吴忠匡、黄裳等先生都做出了各自己独特的贡献。据笔者统计，目前国内外涉及和研究钱学的文章（含各大学学报）多达三百零五篇，其中三分之二以上为大陆学者所作，就连《孙庵老人自订五十以前年谱》这类一般图书馆内无法查找的书籍亦被挖掘出来。花城出版社推出了六卷本《钱钟书论学文选》在读书出版界引起重视，港、台亦正办理此书的翻版手续。由此可见，钱钟书研究确实已购成一“学”，正如出版《鲁迅研究》、《红楼梦学刊》、《郭沫若研究》一样，诞生钱学专门研究刊物，可谓学心所向，实至名归，势所必然。现在，文化艺术出版社顺应时势，终于推出了《钱钟书研究》创刊号，实在令人欣喜。学人幸甚，爱好“钱著”者幸甚！这一期中，中青年学者撰写的分析《围城》人物的《病态文明的病态产儿》和《〈管锥编〉与佛经》，尤其具有学术价值。
    当然，事在草创，这个二十多万字的择选刊本难免遗珠之憾。但编者“区区诚悃之心”，读者自能谅察。黄克、陆文虎二同志为创刊苦形劳神，凡爱好钱学者不会忘记。我们希望这一荟萃海内外钱学研究成果的刊物能坚持办下去，立足国内，探讨交流，走向世界，办出特色，将钱学研究推向更高水平。
