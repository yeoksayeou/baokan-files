The Communist Youth League of Xingtai City has organized a "100 Youth Shock Teams" labor competition to ignite the patriotic enthusiasm and spirit of dedication among the broad masses of young people and to let the ideals of communism shine on their posts. 612 youth shock teams have emerged, actively participating in various industries in Xingtai City, becoming a vital force in stopping turmoil, promoting production, and maintaining a stable and united political situation. In 10 months, they have saved the nation over 10 million yuan and created over 30 million yuan in value.

Since the establishment of the youth shock teams, they have focused on the difficult, weak, and urgent points in production work, carrying out various shock activities. The youth shock team of Xingtai Steel Plant launched the "Youth Safety Supervision Post" activity, discovering and promptly handling 701 equipment accident hazards, stopping 493 instances of unsafe operations, and proposing 331 rationalization suggestions. During the production of export rolling mill liners, Xingtai Metallurgical Plant faced tight deadlines, heavy tasks, and strict quality requirements. The plant's youth league committee organized the youth shock team to work overtime voluntarily, especially during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. The team completed three months' worth of work in one month, earning over $300,000 in foreign exchange. The fourth 200,000-kilowatt generator set at Xingtai Power Plant experienced four consecutive fires, causing significant losses to industrial and agricultural production. The plant's youth league committee led a team of 48 outstanding young league members to sign a one-year full-risk contract with the plant director. They strictly followed operating procedures and completed their contracted tasks by the end of November, operating safely for 353 days.

The spirit of advocating ideals and comparing dedication has become prevalent among the broad masses of young league members in Xingtai City. Since the launch of the "100 Youth Shock Teams" competition, 230,000 young league members have volunteered to serve the public, and nearly 30,000 young people have volunteered to work overtime, receiving widespread praise from the public.
