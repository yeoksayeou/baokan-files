	Hope to Break the Zero Record Soon
	—Written After the CITIC Cup China-Japan Go Name Match

	How to evaluate the Go (Weiqi) level between China and Japan, relevant officials from the Chinese Go Association have repeatedly pointed out: "In terms of the overall level of Go, Japan is still superior to us." Even after China's team won three consecutive victories in the China-Japan Go Match, the above statement has not changed.

	The facts have proven that China's Nie Weiping has the level to compete with any top-tier Go player in Japan, while other young Chinese players do not yet possess this strength. Before this, China's key player Liu Xiaoguang, a 9-dan player, had played three "best-of-three" matches against Japan's "Meijin" and "Tengen," losing all with a score of 0:2. In the second China-Japan Go Name Match, it was Ma Xiaochun's turn to play for China. Many people thought the situation might improve. However, the harsh reality was that he still lost 0:2.

	Ma Xiaochun's defeat was primarily due to his overly solid playing style, which led the entire game into a complex position that Kono Ryoichi, the Meijin, excels in. The Go community acknowledges that no one in the world can safely convert a half-point or one-point advantage into a final victory like Kono Meijin. Therefore, this was a strategic mistake.

	There were also tactical issues. Kono Ryoichi is not invincible. Otherwise, how could Nie Weiping defeat him twice in the first China-Japan Go Match and the first Fujitsu Cup? Taking this China-Japan Go Name Match as an example, especially in the second game, when the mid-game became complex, Kono Ryoichi also made mistakes. It's just that, overall, Ma Xiaochun's mistakes were more frequent. In other words, the technical gap between young Chinese players and top-tier players still exists.

	Mr. Oe Yuji, the managing director of the Japanese Go Association, talked to us about the several "best-of-three" matches between China and Japan: "The Chinese players had bad luck (referring to the fact that the Meijin and Tengen were taken by Kono and Zhao). Because in Japan, no one can defeat these two." Mr. Oe's words can be summarized in three words—"can't beat them." But we think that China's team's bad luck also lies in the fact that Nie Weiping did not win China's Meijin and Tengen. Otherwise...

	Therefore, the author hopes that Nie Weiping will participate in the future "best-of-three" matches, and more importantly, hopes that young Chinese players will work harder, make a breakthrough in their skills, and break the zero record in the "best-of-three" matches as soon as possible.

    愿早日突破零的纪录
    ——写在中信杯中日围棋名人战之后
    怎样评价中、日两国间的围棋水平，中国围棋协会的有关人士多次指出：“就围棋的整体水平而言，日本仍高于我们。”即便在三届中日围棋擂台赛中国队连续获胜后，上述的说法并没有改变。
    事实证明，中国队聂卫平已具有与日本任何一位超一流棋手相匹敌的水平，而其他中国年轻棋手，尚不具备这一实力。在此之前，中国队的实力人物刘小光九段，曾与日本的“名人”、“天元”进行过3次“三番棋”，均以0∶2失利。第二届中日围棋名人战，中国方面轮到马晓春九段上场，不少人认为，情况也许会有所改观。而严酷的事实是依然以0∶2败阵。
    马晓春的失利，首先在于他过于坚实的下法，使全局过早地导入小林光一名人极为擅长的细棋局面。棋界公认，将一目半、半目的优势，安全地运转到最后胜利的本领，当今世界无人能与小林名人相比。因此，这是战略失误。
    也有战术上的问题。小林九段并非无懈可击。否则，聂卫平怎么能在第一届中日围棋擂台赛和首届富士通杯赛中两胜小林呢？就以此次中日围棋名人战为例，特别是第二局比赛，当中盘出现复杂局面时，小林九段也曾有过失误。只是就整局棋而言，马晓春九段的失误之处更多。换句话说，中国年轻棋手与超一流棋手技术上的差距依然存在。
    日本棋院的常务理事大枝雄介先生与我们谈起中、日之间的几次“三番棋”时说：“中国棋手‘运气’不好（意指名人、天元偏偏被小林和赵治勋夺得），因为在日本也没有人能赢得了他们二人。”大枝先生的话归纳起来只有三个字——“下不过”。但我们想，中国队的“运气”不好还在于偏偏聂卫平未能取得中国的名人和天元，否则……
    为此，笔者寄希望于聂卫平能在今后的“三番棋”中出场，当然，更寄希望于中国年轻棋手多下点苦功夫，在技术上来一个飞跃，早日突破“三番棋”上的零的纪录。
