"Wow, this is beautiful. It was worth spending 1800 yuan," people gathered around a brand-new large bookcase in the home of Wang Xuekuan, a villager from Dongguan Village, Luoyang Township, Ganqu County, Jiangsu Province, and chattered excitedly.

Wang Xuekuan, who is already middle-aged, is a genuine farmer and a bookworm recognized by everyone.

When he was 12 years old, his adoptive mother pulled him out of school in tears, and he cried out, "Mom, I want to go to school, I want to go to school..." His adoptive mother hugged him tightly and choked back tears, "Good boy, we can't even afford to eat, how can we afford to send you to school?" He couldn't go to school, but Wang Xuekuan's dream of reading books did not fade. From then on, he would beg for alms with his adoptive mother, who was blind, during the day, and at night, he became a frequent visitor to the homes of a few elderly literati in the village. He almost memorized old, worn-out, thread-bound books like "The Hundred Family Surnames" and "Three Hundred Tang Poems." Sometimes, the elderly literati would give him one or two books, and over a few years, he accumulated about twenty books of various kinds. His adoptive mother, who loved her son dearly, groped around to find a few old wooden planks and had someone nail them into a square frame, which became Wang Xuekuan's first "bookcase."

More than ten years later, the diligent and studious Wang Xuekuan had become known as a "local scholar." His wife, Song Jilian, also strongly supported his reading. Every year at the end of the year, when the dividends were distributed, she would hand him the money. Wang Xuekuan would rush off to Lianyungang, more than 30 miles away, and return with a large stack of books, then shut himself in to read. Wang Xuekuan's reading was quite broad, not only did he read literary and historical books like "Records of the Grand Historian," "I Ching," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Complete Tang Poems," but he also delved into agricultural technology and social science books.

As the books piled up, the original "bookcase" was no longer sufficient. Every time he saw the books stacked in the grain bin being gnawed by rats, Wang Xuekuan would stomp his feet in frustration. None of this escaped Song Jilian's notice. One day in the autumn of 1979, Song Jilian called her husband to her side and carefully took out a wrinkled paper package, saying, "This is the money I've saved for over three years, 63 yuan. You take it and buy a bookcase." "Is this true?" Wang Xuekuan couldn't believe his ears and asked several times. The next day, a real bookcase entered his home.

In recent years, Wang Xuekuan finally had a chance to show his talents. Along with several dozen other villagers, he took over a large fish pond in the village. He not only used his scientific knowledge to enrich himself, earning over 5000 yuan a year, but he also became a consultant for the villagers' wealth. In the summer of 1987, a large-scale fish die-off occurred in the fish pond. Several villagers sat by the pond, crying. Wang Xuekuan picked up a few dead fish and, following the fish farming manual, dissected the dead fish. When he found the cause, he rushed around, collecting wintergreen, tobacco leaves, and wild mint to boil into water, then loaded it onto a flatbed cart and distributed it to the various contract holders to spray in the fish ponds. A miracle happened. After two sprays of the medicine, no more dead fish were found in the hundreds of acres of fish ponds, and not a single yuan was spent. A nearby state-owned farm used Western medicine to treat the fish ponds, spending over 20 yuan per acre.

Reading not only broadened Wang Xuekuan's horizons and increased his knowledge but also gave him higher prestige among his fellow villagers. When there were family disputes or neighbor quarrels among the villagers, they liked to ask him to "settle the matter." Usually, Wang Xuekuan would also often write humorous and witty little poems on the blackboard in the village center, some introducing agricultural techniques, some advising against gambling, some criticizing those who do not respect the elderly, and some praising happy lives. Each time he wrote, it would attract a large crowd of fellow villagers to come and see.

Perhaps it was due to family influence, Wang Xuekuan's two children also particularly loved reading. His son, Si Tong, and his daughter, Hui Ying, had their paintings and calligraphy works win multiple awards in county-level competitions. Even more surprising was that Song Jilian, who had only attended a few years of elementary school, was not willing to fall behind. Who knows when she became obsessed with traditional Chinese medicine, reading medical classics during the farming off-season, and books like "Pathology," "Human Acupuncture Points," "Human Anatomy," "Compendium of Materia Medica," and "Chinese Secret Prescriptions" were almost worn out by her. Since the beginning of last year, she has voluntarily treated more than twenty cases for the villagers.

Now, Wang Xuekuan is no longer the only one who goes to the bookstore. Instead, the whole family goes together. Now, they have a total of more than 1200 books in literature, medicine, science, and calligraphy. The 60-yuan bookcase is certainly not enough, so in the early summer, the whole family decided to spend 1800 yuan to buy a large combination bookcase.

    王老汉三换“书橱”
    韩高源
    “好漂亮，1800块钱花的不算冤枉，”江苏省赣榆县罗阳乡东关村村民王学宽的家里，人们围着个崭新的大书橱，七嘴八舌地议论着。
    早已进入中年的王学宽是个地道的农民，又是大伙公认的书迷。
    12岁那年春天，他的养母流着泪把他从学堂里往家里拽，他扯着养母的衣襟哭喊着：“妈，俺要上学，俺要上学……”，养母一把将他搂在怀里，哽咽道：“乖，连饭都吃不上，拿什么供你上学啊？！”
    学校去不成，可王学宽的读书梦没有泯灭。从那以后，他白天搀着双目失明的养母四处乞讨，晚上就成了本村几个老识字先生家里的常客。《百家姓》、《唐诗三百首》等古旧线装书，他差不多都能成本背下来。有时，老识字先生还送一、二本给他，几年下来，他竟然攒下了二十几本各式各样的书。养母爱子心切，摸索着捡来几块旧木板，找人钉成一个方框，这就是王学宽的第一个“书橱”。
    十几年以后，勤奋好学的王学宽成了人们眼中的“土秀才”。妻子宋继莲也十分支持他读书，每当年终分红的时候，总是把钱往丈夫手中一塞。王学宽一遛小跑，从相隔30多里路的连云港背回一大摞书籍，然后闭门苦读。王学宽读书面比较广，不仅读《史记》、《易经》、《三国演义》、《全唐诗》等文史书籍，对农业科技和社会科学类书籍也广泛涉猎。
    书越积越多，原来的“书橱”早已不顶用，每当看到堆在粮囤里的书籍被老鼠咬得豁边少沿的时候，王学宽就急得直跺脚。这些，全没逃过宋继莲的眼睛。1979年秋的一天，宋继莲把丈夫叫到身边，小心翼翼地掏出一个皱巴巴的纸包对他说：“这是俺攒了3年多的‘私房钱’，63块，你拿去买个书橱吧。”“这是真的？”王学宽简直不相信自己的耳朵，一连问了好几遍。第二天，一个真正的书橱进了他的家。
    近几年，王学宽终于有了用武之地，和其他几十户村民一道，承包了村子里的大片鱼塘。他不仅用所学的科技知识为自己致富，每年都有5000多块钱的收入，而且成了大伙儿致富的智囊和顾问。1987年夏天，鱼塘发生了大面积死鱼现象，几个村民急得蹲在塘边直掉眼泪。王学宽自己捞起几条死鱼，照着养鱼资料，对死鱼实施剖析。当找到症结所在时，他即到处奔波，采集了冬青、烟叶、野薄荷放在一起熬水，然后操起平板车，把药分送给了各个承包户喷洒鱼塘。奇迹出现了，两遍药水喷过以后，几百亩鱼塘再未发现一条死鱼，而且没花一分钱。相邻的一个国营农场用西药治鱼塘，每亩花了二十多块。
    读书，不仅使王学宽开阔了眼界，增长了见识，也使他在乡亲们中间有了更高的威信。村民中家庭不和，邻居纠纷，都喜欢找他“评个理”。平时，王学宽还经常在村中心的黑板上写一些诙谐幽默的小诗，有介绍农技知识的，有劝赌的，有批评不孝敬老人的，也有歌颂幸福生活的，每写一次，都会引来一大帮乡亲们观看。
    也许是家学渊源，王学宽的一双儿女也特别爱读书，大儿子思同的绘画和女儿惠英的书法作品还多次在县级比赛中获奖。更让人惊讶的是：只读过几年小学的宋继莲也不甘落后，不知什么时候迷上了中医学，农闲时整日捧着中医古籍研读，《病理学》、《人体穴位及针灸》、《人体解剖》、《本草纲目》、《中国秘方大全》等几十套医学书籍都快被她翻烂了。从去年初至今，她已经义务为村民治病二十多例。
    如今，王学宽再也不是独自一人逛书店了，而是全家人同来同往。现在，他们全家共有文学、医学、科技、书画等方面的书籍1200多册，那个60块钱的书橱当然是不够用的了，初夏，全家人一合计，干脆花上1800元，买个组合式大书橱。
