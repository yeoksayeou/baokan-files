The remnants of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held a congress today in Budapest. Some party members reconvened the party's 14th congress.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party had announced its transformation into the Hungarian Socialist Party at an extraordinary 14th congress in early October. However, some party members opposed this decision and insisted on continuing the activities of the Socialist Workers' Party.

In his speech, the former general secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Grosz, emphasized that the Socialist Workers' Party has not dissolved and still exists and operates. Currently, there are 65,000 members remaining in the party.

The draft political statement issued by the congress said that many members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party opposed the party's decision to change its nature and name at the October congress.

The statement draft believed that Hungary is in a serious crisis, with the economic situation deteriorating rapidly, political life shifting to the right, and anti-socialist forces becoming increasingly active. The statement draft believed that "under such circumstances, our most important task is to halt this development."

The congress decided to discuss this draft political statement in the second phase of the party congress in early next year. Before the congress concluded, the Central Committee and other leadership bodies were elected. Gyula Tormay was elected as the party chairman. He had previously served as the foreign affairs advisor to the former general secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Grosz.

    原匈牙利社会主义工人党举行代表大会
    新华社布达佩斯12月17日电　原匈牙利社会主义工人党的部分党员代表今天在这里重新召开党的第14次代表大会。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党在10月初举行的第14次（非常）代表大会上已宣布改建为匈牙利社会党。但是，部分党员反对这个决定，坚持社会主义工人党的活动。
    原匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯在讲话中强调，社会主义工人党没有解散，它还存在和活动。现在共有6.5万人留在党内。
    大会发表的政治声明草案说，匈牙利社会主义工人党的许多党员反对党的10月代表大会改变党的性质和名称。
    声明草案认为，匈牙利正处于严重危机之中，经济状况迅速恶化，政治生活正在全面向右转，敌视社会主义的势力日益活跃。声明草案认为，“在这种形势下，我们最重要的任务是制止这样的发展进程。”
    大会决定在明年年初这次党代会的第二阶段讨论这个政治声明草案。大会结束前选举出中央委员会等领导机构。蒂尔迈尔·久洛当选为党的主席，他曾是原匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯的外交顾问。
