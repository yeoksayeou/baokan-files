Title: Starting With Myself

Recently, I read several examples in the newspaper of leaders who strictly discipline themselves, which is inspiring.

The secretary of a certain district committee in Shanghai once declared: "If it is found that I have indulged in extravagant feasts in enterprises even once, I will resign in disgrace."

A responsible official of a bank in a certain place in Shanxi told his subordinates: "If it is found that I have approved a single loan based on personal connections, I am willing to accept disciplinary action."

The secretary of a county committee in Shandong announced at a meeting of all county leaders: "From now on, if any of my relatives or friends use my name to do personal business, no matter who they are or which department they go to, you must not handle it and must firmly refuse."

The key to the anti-corruption efforts of a unit lies in the leaders taking the lead. This is a truth repeatedly proven by practice. Although it cannot be said that a unit's various improper practices will naturally disappear after the leaders, especially the main leaders, pledge to take responsibility themselves, it can be said that in units where the leaders, especially the main leaders, pledge to take responsibility, the atmosphere will definitely be much better and more upright than in ordinary units. Once the leaders pledge to take responsibility, they will naturally strengthen self-discipline. If they go back on their word later, the people will not agree.

When leaders take the lead, subordinates and the masses will naturally follow suit and emulate them. As the saying goes, "If the ruler is upright, who dares to be crooked?" Even if someone wants to do something that violates principles, such as corruption, they will think twice when facing a superior who is upright and corrects himself, rather than a leader who is corrupt and does not correct himself. They will be somewhat deterred and will restrain themselves.

Leaders starting with themselves is like putting a tight rein on themselves: without a spirit of selflessness, one would not have the courage to do so.

Some people, however, think differently. They think, "If I make a firm statement, what if I encounter situations that are not in accordance with principles but are difficult to refuse due to personal connections and power?" After much thought, they still prefer to leave some room and not make a pledge.

There are even a few people who do not even think about starting with themselves. These people follow the principle of "use it or lose it" and think more about how to do a few personal favors while in power. Sometimes, they even brazenly accept bribes. For these few corrupt elements, do not expect them to start with themselves or make any pledges. They can only be exposed and struck down mercilessly.

Of course, in addition to the above examples where leaders publicly declare their determination and attitude, there are also many leaders who genuinely take action to keep their promises. These people are naturally worthy of great praise and promotion.

It is worth noting that those leaders who still leave room for themselves in anti-corruption efforts, replacing principles with so-called "flexibility," should, with the changing climate of anti-corruption efforts, summon the courage to give themselves a "starting from now, starting with myself" pledge.

### 从我做起

    从我做起
    房连水
    近日从报上读到几则领导干部严以律己的实例后，令人振奋。
    上海某区委书记曾表态说：“如果发现我在企业大吃大喝过一次，我就引咎辞职。”
    山西某地一银行负责同志对下级说：如发现我批过一笔人情贷款，我甘愿受纪律处分。
    山东某县委书记在全县领导干部大会上声明：从现在起，凡是我的亲戚朋友打着我的旗号办私事的，不管是谁，不管到哪个部门，你们要一概不办，一律顶住。
    一个单位的廉政建设如何，“头头”带头是最关键、最管用的。这也是被实践反复证明了的真理。虽然不敢断言某单位领导拿“我”打保票之后，本单位的种种不正之风就会自然消失。然而，却可以说在那些领导尤其是主要领导拿“我”打保票的单位，其风气肯定要比一般单位好得多、正得多。领导拿“我”打保票，“大话”说出去了，日后自然会加强自我约束，再自食其言，群众就不答应了。
    领导干部身先士卒，做为下级，做为群众，无形中就会心慕力追、群起效法。正所谓“子帅以正，孰敢不正？”即便有人想干那些违反原则、贪污受贿之类丑事，一想到自己面临的是身正影不斜，正己又正人的上司，而不是那种“屁股上有屎”，己不正也不正人的领导，自然会畏惧三分，有所收敛的。
    领导从我做起，就等于给自己戴上一道“紧箍咒”：如果缺少了无私忘我的精神，是不会有这份勇气的。
    有的人则不然，他们想的是，如果把话说绝了，再遇到那些不合原则但又迫于人情、权势很不好推辞的事咋办？想来想去，还是留有“余地”、别打保票为好。
    更有极少数人压根就没想着从我做起。这些人奉行的是“有权不用，过期作废”的实用主义原则，他们更多的心思是考虑如何在自己在位时办几件个人的事，有时则干脆毫无顾忌地索贿受贿。对这类少数腐败分子，不要指望他们从我做起，打什么保票，只能是给予无情地揭露和打击。
    当然，领导干部从我做起，除了像上述那些把自己的决心和态度公之于众外，也还有大量实实在在地用行动打保票的，这些人自然都是值得大加称道和发扬光大的。
    值得指出的是，那些在廉政建设上至今还留有“余地”，以所谓的“灵活性”代替原则性的某些领导干部，也该随着廉政建设大气候的变化，鼓起勇气，给自己打一张“从现在起，从我做起”的保票。
