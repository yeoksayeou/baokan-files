Japan has approximately 27,000 large enterprises with registered capital exceeding 1 billion yen. According to statistics from Japan's Ministry of Finance, during the fiscal year from July 1988 to June 1989, these large enterprises reported a total income of 33.2673 trillion yen, setting a historical high. However, the National Tax Agency discovered that these large enterprises evaded taxes amounting to 489.5 billion yen in this fiscal year, also breaking the historical record.

The National Tax Agency conducted tax inspections on 4,685 companies with suspicious reported content and found that 4,577 of these companies had engaged in tax evasion, accounting for 97.9% of the total.

According to the analysis, among these inspected companies, 1,024 were found to have falsified accounts, concealing a total of 47.1 billion yen in income.

Some companies, in order to evade taxes, signed fake contracts with overseas subsidiaries to transfer accounts, while others reported bonuses as loans to avoid taxes on entertainment expenses.

These companies truly exhausted all means and strategies to evade taxes.

Currently, the increasingly severe tax evasion by these large enterprises has attracted the attention of relevant parties in Japan.

    偷漏税曝光
    王湘玲
    日本约有2.7万个注册资金在1亿日元以上的大型企业。据日本大藏省统计，在1988年7月—1989年6月财政年度，这些大企业申报的收入总额是33兆2673亿日元，创历史最高水平。但是，税务厅调查发现，这些大企业在本财政年度偷漏税高达4895亿日元，也打破了历史最高纪录。
    税务厅曾对申报内容有疑点的4685家公司进行税务检查，发现其中的4577家公司有偷漏税现象，占总数的97.9％。
    据分析，在这些被检查的公司中，造假帐的有1024家，隐瞒收入共471亿日元。
    有的公司为了逃税，与海外分公司签定假合同，转移帐目，还有的公司把酬金作为借贷金申报，以期逃避交际费的课税。
    这些公司为了逃税，真可谓绞尽脑汁，用尽心机。
    目前，这些大企业日趋严重的偷漏税现象，已引起日本有关方面的关注。
