Title: Trucking Companies Face "Difficulties on the Road"

Recently, a reporter conducted interviews in Nanjing and heard from officials and employees of the Jinling Automobile Transport Company that some provinces and cities have set up checkpoints on highways, imposing repeated fees, making them feel that the economic burden is too heavy to bear.

This company is a key enterprise under the Jiangsu Provincial Transportation Department, with more than 800 vehicles of various types, mainly engaged in freight transportation and also providing passenger services. Last year, it completed over 180 million ton-kilometers of freight transportation, providing strong support for industrial production and disaster relief. However, due to man-made "difficulties on the road," transportation efficiency has decreased, affecting the timely completion of some transportation tasks.

Company manager Qiu Changhua said that in the past, drivers going out on trips within the province or to other provinces only needed to carry about 20 yuan for meals. Now, for each trip, they need to carry between 400 to 1,000 yuan in public funds, all for paying various unreasonable fees along the way. For example, when a freight truck enters Jiangxi Province, it has to pay an 80 yuan toll; when passing over the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou, it has to pay an 80 yuan bridge toll; and so on.

Within Jiangsu Province and in other provinces along the highways, some departments and township governments have arbitrarily set up checkpoints. Each checkpoint has the authority to collect fees or impose fines according to its own "local policies." Moreover, policies and regulations between provinces and cities often contradict each other. For instance, Shandong Province's relevant departments require that all trucks must install rear bumpers, with fines for non-compliance; while Hebei Province requires that trucks must not install rear bumpers. Trucks passing through these two provinces are either violating regulations here or being fined there.

In some places in Anhui Province, checkpoints along the road inspect truck business licenses, fining those without one. Individual truck operators can of course carry their licenses with them, but state-owned transportation companies have only one business license, with hundreds of trucks operating daily in different directions. Drivers cannot carry a copy for each truck, so they have no choice but to accept the fines.

Now, many places have built highways and bridges, and trucks passing through have to pay tolls. Due to the high frequency and amount of these tolls, transportation departments are deterred. The 110-kilometer route from Nanjing to Yangzhou has 3 toll booths, and trucks passing through have to pay a total of 42 yuan, while each truck earns about 220 yuan per trip. Moreover, transportation companies have already paid the state 15% of their business income as road maintenance fees. Even more puzzling is that some places, which have not built new roads and whose existing roads are poorly maintained, demand pre-payment for road construction. In Jiangxi Province, there is an old, potholed road, and passing vehicles also have to pay a toll, supposedly to raise funds for repairing this road.

Officials and employees of the Jinling Automobile Transport Company strongly appeal to relevant departments to quickly formulate unified highway traffic management regulations, stop the arbitrary fining and tolling, and ensure the smooth flow of highway transportation.

### 货运汽车“行路难”

    货运汽车“行路难”
    最近记者在南京采访，听到金陵汽车运输公司的干部与职工反映，一些省市的有关部门在公路上自设关卡，重复收费，使他们感到经济负担过重，难以承受。
    这个公司是江苏省交通部门的大型骨干企业，拥有各类运输汽车800多辆，以货运为主，兼营客运，去年仅货运就完成1.8亿多吨公里，有力地支援了工业生产和救灾工作。但由于人为制造的“行路难”，运输效率下降，影响了一些运输任务及时完成。
    公司经理仇长华说，过去司机出车到省内外，只要带一二十元饭费即可。现在出一次车，少则携带公款四五百元，多则千元以上，为的是支付沿途名目繁多的不合理收费。例如，货运汽车进入江西省境内，要收过境费80元；车过杭州钱塘江大桥，要收过桥费80元；如此等等。
    在江苏省内和外省的公路沿线，一些部门和村镇政府，擅自设置一道又一道的检查站，哪道关卡都有权按照自己的“土政策”收费或罚款。而省市之间的政策和规章又常常相互抵触，比如山东省有关部门规定货车一律要安装后保险杠，违者罚款；而河北省则规定货车不准装后保险杠。汽车通过这两个省，不是这里违章，就是那里受罚。
    安徽省有些地方沿路检查汽车营业执照，未带执照者罚款，个体运输汽车当然可以随身携带，而国营运输公司只有一个营业执照，每天有数百辆汽车各奔东西，司机不可能人手一份，就只好眼巴巴受罚了。
    现在不少地方修了公路和桥梁，汽车通过要收费，由于收费次数多，数额大，使运输部门望而生畏。南京至扬州有110公里，沿途设卡收费者3处，汽车通过一次共交费42元，而每辆汽车运一趟货收运费220元左右，况且运输公司已按规定向国家交了相当于营业收入15％的养路费。更令人费解的是，有些地方根本没有修新公路，原有的路面养护极差，却提出要预收修路费。江西省境内有一条坑坑洼洼的旧公路，过往车辆也要交费，据说是筹集修这条路的资金。
    金陵汽车运输公司的干部和职工强烈呼吁，有关部门尽快制定统一的公路交通管理法规，制止乱罚款、乱收费现象，保障公路运输的畅通。
