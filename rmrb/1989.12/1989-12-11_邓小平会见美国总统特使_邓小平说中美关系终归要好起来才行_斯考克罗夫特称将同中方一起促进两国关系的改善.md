Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th.

Deng Xiaoping met with the U.S. Presidential Envoy and National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, this morning at 11:00 AM in the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People. The two sides engaged in a friendly and extensive conversation.

Deng Xiaoping warmly welcomed Scowcroft's visit. He said, "Your action is a significant one. The significance lies in the fact that despite some entanglements and differences between China and the U.S., ultimately, China and the U.S. must improve relations. This is necessary for world peace and stability."

Scowcroft said, "I fully agree with your statement."

After Deng Xiaoping and the guest took their seats, Deng continued, "I have already retired, and normally such matters are not my responsibility. However, since the special envoy of my old friend President Bush has come, it would be impolite and unreasonable for me not to meet with him."

Scowcroft conveyed President Bush's warm regards to Deng Xiaoping.

He said, "Even though you have retired, President Bush still considers you a friend, forever a friend. I represent President Bush in expressing my gratitude, especially since you have taken the time on a Sunday to meet with me despite your retirement."

Deng Xiaoping smiled and said, "General, your visit this time is to report on the Malta talks. In reality, it should be said that both sides have a common wish: to resolve the entanglements that have existed between China and the U.S. since June as soon as possible, to resolve them early, and to allow China-U.S. relations to develop and progress anew. This is our common wish."

Deng Xiaoping also asked the envoy to convey to President Bush, "In the East, there is an elderly retiree in China who is concerned about the improvement and development of China-U.S. relations."

Scowcroft expressed that he would work with the Chinese side to promote the improvement of bilateral relations.

Deng Xiaoping said, "We are all old friends." He asked Scowcroft to convey his warm regards and best wishes to President Bush.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Vice Minister Liu Huaqiu, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley were present during the meeting.

    本报北京十二月十日讯　记者何崇元报道：今天上午十一时，邓小平同志在人民大会堂福建厅会见了美国总统特使、总统国家安全事务助理布伦特·斯考克罗夫特。宾主进行了亲切友好和广泛的交谈。
    邓小平对斯考克罗夫特的来访表示热烈欢迎。他说：“你这个行动，是一个重要的行动。重要的意义就是，中美尽管有一些纠葛、一些这样那样的问题和分歧，但归根到底中美是要好起来才行。这是世界和平和稳定的需要。”
    斯考克罗夫特说：“我完全赞成您的说法。”
    邓小平和客人落座后接着说：“我已经退休了，本来这样的事情不是我份内的事，但是我的朋友布什总统的特使来，我不见是太不礼貌，也太不合情理了。”
    斯考克罗夫特转达了布什总统对邓小平的亲切问候。
    他说，“尽管您退休了，布什总统仍把您当作朋友，永远是朋友。我代表布什总统告诉您，我非常感谢，尤其是在您已经退休了又是在星期天抽时间来见我。”
    邓小平笑着说：“将军这次来访是通报马耳他会谈，实际上应该说是双方一个共同的愿望：能够尽快解决六月以来中美之间在一些问题上存在的纠葛，早点解决，使中美关系能够得到新的发展新的前进。这是我们的共同愿望。”
    邓小平还请特使转告布什总统：“在东方的中国有一位退休老人关心着中美关系的改善与发展。”
    斯考克罗夫特表示，将同中方一起促进两国关系的改善。
    邓小平说，“我们都是熟人、老朋友。”他请斯考克罗夫特转达他对布什总统的亲切问候和良好祝愿。
