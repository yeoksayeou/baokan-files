In the past, "dilapidated buildings" were often used to describe schools in the old revolutionary base area of Baise in Guangxi. In recent years, various levels of government in this region have led the people to tighten their belts and raise 36.29 million yuan to build and repair dangerous school buildings, reducing the rate of dangerous buildings from 30.5% to 1.46%.

Baise is a poor, mountainous area in the border region. Comrades such as Deng Xiaoping once held the famous "Baise Uprising" here. Due to various reasons, the economic development of Baise has been slow, and the cause of education has not received the attention it deserves. A few years ago, statistics showed that the proportion of dangerous buildings in primary and secondary schools ranked first in the entire autonomous region, and the level of teaching had not improved significantly.

Economic development must be accompanied by educational development. Facing the serious problem of dangerous buildings, the regional committee and the administrative office issued a call to urgently repair dangerous school buildings and took the lead in consciously reducing various expenditures. The main leaders of the region live in dormitories built in the 1950s, which have been dilapidated and had leaks and water seepage. The regional financial bureau proposed at the deputy director's office meeting to demolish and rebuild, which was rejected twice by the leaders on the grounds of financial constraints and the fact that there were still dangerous buildings in schools that needed repair. According to incomplete statistics, despite the extremely difficult financial situation, various levels of government have tightened their belts and contributed 7.0961 million yuan to urgently repair dangerous school buildings.

Seeing and hearing the facts, a considerable number of farmers have come to realize the importance of knowledge. To create a good learning environment for their descendants, farmers who have not yet shaken off poverty have actively raised funds for education. In Fulong Village, Linquan Township, Debao County, most of the farmers are illiterate. In 1988, the per capita net income was only about 200 yuan. All 13 households in the village donated money and materials totaling more than 2,500 yuan, with an average of 192.38 yuan per person, to help build a new classroom building for the village school. Huang Jinbo, a farmer from Napo Town, Tianyang County, who had just escaped poverty and become wealthy, donated about 20,000 yuan worth of 80,000 red bricks and a batch of building materials to the school, expressing his concern for the next generation.

Nowadays, in many rural areas of the old revolutionary base area of Baise, the best buildings are schools. In recent years, the entire region has used raised funds and other sources to build more than 500 new school buildings and repair 392,000 square meters of dangerous buildings, solving the problem of dangerous school buildings before solving the problem of basic subsistence.

### 万绿丛中一点白　最好房子是学校  百色中小学基本无危房

    万绿丛中一点白　最好房子是学校
    百色中小学基本无危房
    本报南宁12月6日电　记者郑盛丰、蒋耀强报道：“破烂房子”，曾一度成为广西百色老区学校的代名词。近年来，这个地区各级政府带领群众勒紧裤带，集资3629万元用于新建、维修中小学危房，危房率由30.5％降到1.46％。
    百色地区是老少边穷山区，邓小平等同志曾在这里举行过著名的“百色起义”。由于各种原因，百色地区经济发展缓慢，教育事业未得到应有的发展。前几年统计，中小学危房所占比例，列全自治区榜首，教学水平也迟迟未有较大的提高。
    发展经济必须发展教育。面对严重的危房情况，地委、行署发出了抢修中小学危房的号召，并自觉地带头压缩各种开支。地区主要领导住的宿舍建于50年代，已年久失修，曾有漏雨渗水现象。地区财政局在专员办公会议上提出要推倒重建，两次都被领导以经费紧张、学校尚有危房未修好为由否定。据不完全统计，在财政开支极为困难的情况下，各级政府硬是紧勒裤带，出资709.61万元，投入了抢修中小学危房。
    耳闻目睹和事实的比较，相当部分农民认识到了知识的重要。为了给后代创造良好的学习环境，尚未摆脱贫困的农民大力集资办教育。德保县足荣乡林区屯农民大部分为文盲，1988年人均纯收入不过200元左右，全屯13户人家出钱捐物计2500余元，人均192.38元，帮助村中学校建起了一座新的教学楼。田阳县那坡镇农民黄锦波，刚刚脱贫致富，便把自产的价值约2万余元的8万块红砖和一批建筑材料送给了学校，表达了对后一代的一片关心之情。
    如今的百色老区，相当部分农村已是“万绿丛中一点白，房子最好的是学校。”近年来，全地区已利用集资款等新建校舍500余栋，维修危房39.2万平方米，在解决温饱问题之前解决了中小学危房问题。
