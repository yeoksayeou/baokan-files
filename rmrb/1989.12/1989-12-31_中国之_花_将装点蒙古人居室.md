For thousands of years, the Mongolian people have lived as nomads, residing in yurts and having no fixed abode. Over the past few decades, with the rapid development of the Mongolian People's Republic's economic construction, the Mongolian people have gradually moved into new apartment buildings. In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, various high-rise buildings have sprouted up. Government agencies and other employees have basically moved into these buildings. Their bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms are all well-decorated and furnished. Thus, using flowers to beautify the home has become a necessity and a joy in the lives of the Mongolian people.

However, for the Mongolian people living in a high-altitude cold region with an average elevation of 1580 meters, an average annual temperature of only 2.7 degrees Celsius, and a frost-free period of less than 100 days, it is impossible to grow flowers outdoors, so they can only grow shade-loving plants indoors to beautify and enhance their living environment.

With the opening up to the outside world, the etiquette of young Mongolians has gradually shifted from the traditional practice of respectfully presenting a khadag (a ceremonial scarf) to giving fresh flowers as gifts. However, the market supply of fresh flowers cannot meet the demand, and prices are rising. The retail price of a single wild chrysanthemum is 3 tögrög (approximately $1.75), while a single rose costs 5 tögrög. Fresh flowers are indeed very precious in Mongolia. If one follows the Mongolian custom of giving an odd number of flowers as a gift, presenting 3 roses would cost over $5.

China has not previously exported polyester and plastic artificial flowers to Mongolia. Recently, a Chinese handicraft trade delegation to Mongolia brought a batch of single-stemmed flowers and floral potted plants produced by the Tianmen Artificial Flower Factory in Hubei. After the samples were exhibited, they were immediately praised by various Mongolian officials, who found the Chinese artificial flowers to have a wide variety of species, realistic shapes, easy to clean, non-fading, non-deforming, durable, and cost-effective. The director of the Mongolian General Import and Export Corporation happily expressed his intention to visit the factory in Hubei to select the required varieties.

    中国之“花”将装点蒙古人居室
    吴耀奎
    千百年了，蒙古人民以游牧为生，住在蒙古包里，居无定处。近几十年来，随着蒙古人民共和国经济建设的迅速发展，蒙古人民逐步迁进楼宇新居。在首都乌兰巴托，各种楼群拔地而起。政府机关等职工已基本住进楼房。其卧室、会客室、厨房、卫生间等装修、摆设都很讲究。于是，用花美化家庭，已成为蒙古人民生活的必需和乐趣。
    然而，对于生活在全国平均海拔1580米、年平均气温仅为2.7摄氏度、无霜期不足百天的高寒地区的蒙古人民来说，企求室外养花只能望天兴叹，无奈，他们只能在室内养植阴性花，以美化和调节生活。
    随着对外开放，蒙古年轻人的礼节逐渐从以传统敬献哈达为最尊贵转向赠送鲜花。可是市场上的鲜花供不应求，且价格日益高涨。一枝野菊花的市场零售价为蒙币3图格里克（约合1.75美元），而一枝月季花的售价则高达5图格里克。鲜花在蒙古实在太宝贵了。如果按照蒙古人送礼送单不送双的风俗习惯，赠送3枝月季花需花5个多美元。
    我国生产的涤纶和塑料等人造花过去没有对蒙古出口。最近中国工艺品赴蒙贸易小组带去一批我国湖北天门人造花工厂生产的单枝花和花果盆景。样品展出后，立即受到蒙古各方面人士的赞赏，认为我国人造花品种多、造型真、易冲洗、不褪色、不变形、耐保存，价廉物美。蒙古杂品进出口公司负责人高兴地表示，打算去湖北该厂访问，以便选购所需品种。
