    Smoking can lead to various lung diseases. Recent domestic and international research has also found that certain fatal diseases are related to smoking.
    Recently, researchers from the UK and the US conducted a joint investigation, revealing that smokers have a significantly increased risk of developing leukemia. They surveyed over 284,000 American veterans with smoking habits. Between 1954 and 1969, 723 of them died from leukemia. The mortality rate from leukemia among smokers was 53% higher than among non-smokers. The risk of developing leukemia is directly proportional to the amount of smoking.
    The Japanese Cancer Research Institute conducted a 17-year lifestyle survey of 265,000 citizens aged 40 and above. They found that smoking fewer than 30 cigarettes a day increased the risk of liver cancer to 3.1 and lung cancer to 4.5. For those smoking more than 30 cigarettes a day, both risks increased to 6.8. In summarizing the survey, they noted that while alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis, smoking is more likely to cause liver cancer.

    吸烟致病新说
    吸烟可以导致人体肺部多种疾病。近年来国内外研究还发现，某些新的致命疾病也与吸烟有关。
    前不久，英、美两国研究人员联合进行了一项调查表明，吸烟者发生白血病的危险性显著增加，他们调查了28.4万多名有吸烟习惯的美军退伍人员，在1954—1969年间死于白血病共有723人，吸烟者死于白血病的机率比不吸烟者高53％，白血病的发病危险性与吸烟程度成正比。
    日本防癌学研究所对26.5万名40岁以上的国民，在17年间的生活方式调查中发现，每天吸烟30支以下，患肝癌的危险度为3.1，患肺癌的危险度为4.5，如果在30支以上则两项的危险度均为6.8。他们在总结调查时指出：饮酒易于引起肝硬化，而吸烟容易导致肝癌。　（11月25日《北京科技报》易军芽文）
