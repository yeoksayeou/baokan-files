The Latin American economy is still in a state of stagnation and recession this year.

At yesterday's press conference, Perez del Castillo, the Permanent Secretary of the Latin American Economic System, pointed out that the per capita output in Latin America has been declining for two consecutive years, and in 1989, it was 10% lower than in 1980. This year, inflation in the entire region has reached an unprecedented level, with some countries experiencing hyperinflation, and the fiscal deficits of most countries continue to increase.

This year, the net outflow of funds due to debt repayment in Latin America reached $35 billion, higher than last year. Meanwhile, external investment in Latin America continues to decline. Perez del Castillo pointed out that although Latin American countries have made tremendous efforts to expand exports, the region's share in global trade continues to shrink. In 1980, this share was 6%, but by 1988, it had dropped to 3.6%, and this year's situation indicates that this downward trend is still continuing.

Perez said that the heavy debt burden remains the main obstacle to Latin America's resumption of growth and development.

    拉美经济体系常设秘书认为
    拉美今年经济继续恶化
    本报加拉加斯12月12日电  记者朱满庭报道：拉丁美洲经济今年仍处在停滞和衰退之中。
    在昨天举行的记者招待会上，拉美经济体系常设秘书佩雷斯·德尔卡斯蒂约指出，拉美地区人均产值已连续两年下降，1989年比1980年下降了10％。今年，全地区的通货膨胀达到了前所未有的水平，有些国家还出现了恶性通货膨胀，大多数国家的财政赤字继续增加。
    拉美地区今年因偿债形成的对外纯资金转移达350亿美元，比去年还高。而外部对拉美的投资则不断下降，佩雷斯·德尔卡斯蒂约指出，虽然拉美各国为扩大出口作出了巨大努力，但整个地区在全球贸易中的比重却不断缩小。1980年，这一比重为6％，而1988年已下降到3.6％，今年的情况表明，这一下降趋势仍在发展。
    佩雷斯说，债务负担过重仍是阻碍拉美重新取得增长和发展的主要障碍。
