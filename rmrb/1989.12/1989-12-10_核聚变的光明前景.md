Scientists at the European Joint Nuclear Fusion Research Laboratory in Abingdon, UK, are engaged in a research project aimed at leading the world in this field. They are developing a type of nuclear fusion reactor that can provide atomic energy without producing nuclear waste. The results of their experiments have allowed scientists to determine that the thermonuclear fusion reactor they are building can reach temperatures ten times higher than the core of the sun. The nuclear energy produced by this reactor will become an inexhaustible source of electricity.

The European Joint Nuclear Fusion Research Laboratory is a subsidiary of the European Community. The European Community has raised 500 million pounds for the aforementioned research plan. The project is led by Dr. Paul-Henri Rebut. Dr. Rebut said, "The European Joint Nuclear Fusion Research Laboratory has achieved its main goal, that is, as a source of energy, the feasibility of nuclear fusion science has been established."

Scientists in Abingdon have successfully completed an experiment in which hydrogen atoms were fused at a temperature of 200 million degrees Celsius. The purpose of the experiment is to force hydrogen atoms to fuse into the heavier element helium, thereby releasing excess energy. Dr. Rebut said that the primary fuel for the fusion reactor, deuterium (heavy hydrogen), is easily obtained from the decomposition of seawater, and this resource is virtually inexhaustible. He also said that the electricity generated by this nuclear fusion will exceed that of any power station.

However, to convert the energy released by this nuclear fusion into electricity, very large machines must be built. Experts estimate that it will take 10 years to build such a machine. The actual construction of a commercial nuclear fusion power plant will take even longer. They say that it may not be possible until the year 2030.

    核聚变的光明前景
    位于英国阿宾顿的欧洲联合核聚变实验室的科学家们，正从事一项力争领先于美苏日的研究活动，他们在制作一种核聚变反应堆，它可提供原子能，而不产生核废料。实验的结果已使科学家们可以判定：他们着手建造的热核聚变反应堆可达到10倍于太阳中心的温度。这种反应堆所产生的核能将成为取之不竭的电力的源泉。
    欧洲联合核聚变实验室是欧洲共同体的下属单位。欧洲共同体为上述研究计划筹集了5亿英镑。该计划的主持人是保罗—亨利·里伯特博士。里伯特博士说：“欧洲联合核聚变实验室已实现它的主要目标，即：作为一种能源，已确立了核聚变科学的可行性。”
    阿宾顿的科学家们已首次成功地完成温度高达摄氏2亿度氢原子聚变的实验。实验的目的是强迫氢原子聚变成较重的氦元素，从而释放出多余的能量。里伯特博士说，用作聚变反应堆主要燃料的重氢（即氘），易于从海水的分解中得到，这种原料的供应简直是取之不尽。他还说，这种核聚变所产生的发电量将超过任何发电站。
    但是，为将这种核聚变释放的能量变成电力，还必须建造很大的机器。据专家估计，需要10年的时间才能造成这种机器。而商业性核聚变发电站的真正建成则需更长的时间。他们说，也许要到2030年，才有可能成为现实。　（孟宪谟  编译）
