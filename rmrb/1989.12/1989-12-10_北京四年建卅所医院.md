    Beijing has constructed 30 hospitals from 1986 to 1989, with a total building area of 410,000 square meters and an additional 5,236 beds, which has somewhat alleviated the difficulty of the masses in seeking medical treatment.

    According to a report in the Beijing Daily, despite the severe financial constraints of the state, a total of 660 million yuan has been invested by the central government and Beijing Municipality over the past four years for the construction of medical facilities.

    Among the newly built hospitals, a significant portion is dedicated to addressing the issue of difficulty in seeking specialized medical treatment. For example, the Beijing Children's Hospital is the only municipal-level pediatric specialty hospital. Due to the poor and cramped conditions of the wards and clinics, it was far from meeting the needs. Now, a brand-new children's hospital has been built, which is expected to be put into use next year.

    北京四年建卅所医院
    本报讯　北京市从1986年到1989年共建成医院30所，建筑面积达41万平方米，新增病床5236张，使群众看病难的问题有所缓解。
    据《北京日报》报道，在国家财力十分紧张的情况下，4年来中央和北京市共投资6.6亿元用于医疗设施的建设。
    在这批新建的医院中，有相当部分是为解决专科医院看病难而建的。例如北京市儿童医院是市一级唯一的儿童专科医院，由于病房、诊室简陋狭小，远不能适应需要。现在一座崭新的儿童医院已经拔地而起，明年可望投入使用。
