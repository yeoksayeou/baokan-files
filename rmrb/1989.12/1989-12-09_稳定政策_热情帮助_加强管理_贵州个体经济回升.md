In recent days, Mr. Zheng, who runs a small eatery in Guiyang, has been feeling more optimistic. Just a short while ago, he confided in me, "Business has been tough lately. The 'taxes' are too high, and on top of that, I'm worried about changes in government policies. If that happens, I might not be able to keep my head above water."

Since the latter half of last year, due to factors such as credit tightening, scarcity of raw materials, and inadequate management and service work, Guizhou's individual economy has shown a noticeable decline. According to statistics from the provincial industrial and commercial administrative department, the number of individual industrial and commercial households in the province has decreased from over 300,000 at the end of June last year to over 220,000 at the end of June this year. The total production value and business revenue for the first half of the year have also dropped from 330 million yuan and 1.36 billion yuan to 230 million yuan and 900 million yuan, respectively. Many individual industrial and commercial households are feeling anxious.

This situation has drawn the attention of various levels of party and government leaders and the industrial and commercial administrative departments. Since this year, the provincial industrial and commercial bureau has held four meetings to analyze and study the causes of the decline and corresponding strategies. Recently, the provincial party committee and government issued a document reaffirming the commitment to maintaining a public ownership economy as the mainstay while continuing to develop the individual economy. They emphasized the need to open up new areas for production and business operations, particularly encouraging and supporting urban and rural individual laborers to engage in productive development and service industries for production and daily life.

To support the development of the individual economy, the Guizhou provincial industrial and commercial management department has strengthened its management of individual industrial and commercial households. Industrial and commercial cadres have extensively propagated the party's policies and industrial and commercial management regulations to individual industrial and commercial households. Simultaneously, based on the existing urban credit cooperatives, they have vigorously organized various forms of savings associations and mutual aid funds for individual households. This has helped over 13,000 households facing financial difficulties to continue their production and business operations.

Due to these measures, the downward trend in the individual economy has been reversed since the latter half of this year. By the end of October, the number of individual industrial and commercial households in the province had increased to over 250,000. From January to October, the total production value of the individual economy in the province reached 497 million yuan, with a business revenue of 1.673 billion yuan.

### 稳定政策　热情帮助　加强管理  贵州个体经济回升

    稳定政策　热情帮助　加强管理
    贵州个体经济回升
    本报贵阳12月8日电　记者潘帝都报道：在贵阳街头开小吃店的郑老板，最近又高兴起来了。然而就在前些日子，他忧虑地对我说：现在生意越来越不好做了，“关税”太多且不讲，就怕政府政策变，到时吃不下兜着走。
    去年下半年以来，由于受信贷压缩、原材料紧缺以及管理服务工作未能及时跟上等影响，贵州的个体经济明显地出现了下滑现象。据省工商行政管理部门的统计，全省个体工商户已由去年6月底的30多万户减少到今年6月底的22万多户。半年的总产值和营业额也由3.3亿元和13.6亿元下降为2.3亿元和9亿元。许多个体工商户为此忧心忡忡。
    此种情况引起了各级党政领导和工商行政管理部门的重视。今年以来，省工商局先后召开了4次会议，专门对下滑原因及其对策进行了分析和研究。最近省委、省政府又下达文件重申，坚持以公有制为主体，继续发展个体经济，开辟新的生产经营领域，特别要鼓励和支持城乡个体劳动者从事生产性的开发经营和为生产、生活服务的第三产业。
    为了支持个体经济的发展，贵州省工商管理部门加强了对个体工商户的管理工作。工商干部广泛向个体工商户宣传党的政策和工商管理法规，同时在积极办好已有城市信用社的基础上，大力组织各种形式的个体户储金会、互助基金会，帮助缺乏资金或资金周转困难的个体工商户调剂资金，使1.3万多个资金困难户得以继续生产经营。
    由于采取以上措施，今年下半年以来，全省止住了个体经济下滑势头。截至10月底，全省个体工商户已回升到25万多户。1至10月累计，全省个体经济总产值已达4.97亿元，营业额16.73亿元。
