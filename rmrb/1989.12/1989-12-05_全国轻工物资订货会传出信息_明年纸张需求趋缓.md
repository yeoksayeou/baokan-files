    A recent message from the National Light Industry Materials Procurement Conference held in Anyang indicates that China's paper supply has shifted from a shortage last year to a buyer's market, with "Anyang paper being cheap" and sales sluggish.

    Experts analyze that this year, due to an increase in the effective supply of paper nationwide, and a decrease in the publication and circulation of newspapers and books, the demand for newsprint and offset paper has been basically met, and the prices of non-planned paper have started to fall. Due to the decline in cement sales, the demand for cement packaging paper bags has shifted from tight to balanced.

    Next year, the national planned paper production will slightly increase compared to this year: newsprint supply and demand will be balanced, with a slight surplus; the market demand for offset paper will be basically the same as this year, with primary and secondary school textbooks, college and university teaching materials, key books, and communication telegraph offset paper receiving priority guarantees; packaging paper bags will be mainly supplied to large and medium-sized cement plants designated by the state for production and use; the market demand for coated paper, coated magazine paper, gravure printing paper, and capacitor paper will all decrease; the demand for cable paper will remain stable.

    Wang Yongyi, Deputy General Manager of the China Light Industry Materials Supply and Marketing Corporation, said that the current situation of paper supply exceeding demand in the national market is only a temporary phenomenon. The difficulty in product sales is both an opportunity and a challenge for production plants, which will prompt production plants to further improve product quality, adjust product structure, and improve enterprise management. Currently, the per capita annual paper consumption in developed countries is 40 kilograms, while in China it is only 10 kilograms. With the development and progress of society, the paper market in China still has great potential.

    全国轻工物资订货会传出信息
    明年纸张需求趋缓
    本报讯　日前在安阳召开的全国轻工物资订货会传来信息：我国纸张供应一改去年供不应求的景象，“安阳纸贱”，销售不畅的买方市场开始出现。
    据行家分析，今年以来，由于全国纸张市场有效供给增加，而报刊、图书出版发行量下降，新闻纸、凸版纸基本满足需求，计划外纸张价格开始下滑。由于水泥市场销售回落，水泥包装用纸袋纸由紧转平。
    明年，全国纸张计划产量比今年将略有上升：新闻纸供求平衡，略有富余；凸版纸市场需求与今年基本持平，中小学课本、大中专教材、重点图书、通讯电传用凸版纸将得到重点保证；包装用纸袋纸将重点供应国家调拨的大中型水泥厂生产使用；涂料纸、涂料画报纸、胶版印刷纸、电容器纸明年市场需求都有所下降；电缆纸持平。
    中国轻工物资供销公司副总经理王永义说，全国纸张市场出现供大于求的状况只是暂时现象。产品销售不畅对生产厂来说既是一个机遇，也是一个挑战，这将促使生产厂进一步提高产品质量，调整产品结构，改进企业管理。现在世界发达国家人均年消费纸张40公斤，而我国人均年消费纸张仅10公斤，伴随着社会的发展和进步，我国纸张市场还是大有潜力的。
