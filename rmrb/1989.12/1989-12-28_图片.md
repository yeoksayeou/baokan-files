The Liaoning Province Saline-Alkaline Land Utilization Research Institute is the only such center in China dedicated to the utilization and improvement of saline-alkaline lands. This institute has developed the Liaoning Salt 2 (Liaoshan 2) variety of rice, which has an average yield of 650-750 kilograms per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares). This variety has been designated as the "standard sample variety" for Liaoning and has been promoted across more than a million mu in the province. In July 1989, relevant national departments designated Liaoshan 2 as the first recommended variety for the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period in northern regions, aiming to expand its promotion to 4 million mu.
