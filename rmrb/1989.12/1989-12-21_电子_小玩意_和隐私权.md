Western countries have long used electronic technology to collect military, political, and economic intelligence, but now in the United States, this technology has found a new application: eavesdropping on personal privacy. This has sparked a controversy between electronics manufacturers, who are focused on profits, and advocates for privacy rights. As American newspapers have reported, "The United States is being swept up in a wave of high-tech eavesdropping."

The situation is as follows: American electronics manufacturers are continually releasing a variety of new products, such as miniature "one-way wireless intercoms." You can secretly place one of these in any household appliance, such as a lamp or clock, and it will transmit conversations from the room to another location equipped with a receiver. There are also "spy briefcases," which look identical to real ones. If you quietly place one on a table and lightly tap the handle, it can record sounds from the room for hours. Additionally, there is an "amplified recording device" that, when placed under a bed or in a pocket, can secretly record all conversations.

According to reports, due to the widespread use of these "gadgets," there is no privacy left in the United States. Many people accuse manufacturers of prioritizing profits over ethics, making it difficult to protect the privacy rights guaranteed by the Constitution. A journalist named Randolph Blayenton, who has experienced this firsthand, criticizes manufacturers for knowing that these "gadgets" could be used illegally but doing nothing to prevent it. However, the manufacturers counter that their products have legitimate uses, and whether they are used for other purposes or violate the law depends on the buyer, not the seller.

    电子“小玩意”和隐私权
    士芳
    西方国家凭借电子技术，收集军事、政治和经济情报已不足为奇。但时下在美国，这种技术又有了新用场，正被用于探听别人的隐私。于是，在只顾发财的电子制造商和主张保护隐私权者之间触发了一场风波。正如美国报刊所说：“美国正被卷入一股高技术侦听的浪潮中”。
    事情是这样的。美国电子制造商不断推出种类繁多的新产品，如微型的“单向无线对讲电话机”。你将它偷偷放进室内任何一件电器用具如台灯、电钟里，就能把房里的谈话传至另一处设有接收机的地方。又如“间谍公文包”，它看上去同真的无异，你若悄悄把它放在桌边，只须轻轻敲一下把手，它便能连续数小时录下屋内的任何声响。还有一种“增音录声机”，将它放在床下或口袋里，能秘密录下一切谈话。
    据报道，由于这些“小玩意”的广泛使用，在美国已无密可保。许多人指责制造商光顾发财而不惜干这种缺德事，致使受到宪法保护的隐私权难以得到维护。一个吃过此种苦头的名叫伦道夫·勃莱文顿的记者，指责制造商明知这些“小玩意”可能被非法使用，却不设法予以防止。但是，制造商反击说，他们的产品都有合法用途，至于是否被派作别的用场，是否违犯法律，则取决于买主而不是售方。
