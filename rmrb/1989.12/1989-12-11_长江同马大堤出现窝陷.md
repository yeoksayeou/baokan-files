Recently, a serious settling incident occurred in the Tongma Dike along the Yangtze River in the jurisdiction of Anhui Province. Relevant personnel from the province swiftly rushed to the scene and organized efforts to urgently repair the damage.

On the morning of December 3rd at 11:00 AM, the ground suddenly settled near the Tongma Dike in the Liuhe Round Dike section of Wangjiang County, approximately 50 meters from the base of the dike. By December 4th, the settlement had extended to a length of 234.5 meters. The edge of the settlement reached the base of the Yangtze River dike, and cracks appeared at the 17-meter elevation of the dike body, continuously extending and forming a settlement area of over 23,000 square meters.

    长江同马大堤出现窝陷
    据新华社合肥12月9日电（通讯员殷经游、记者宣奉华）最近，位于安徽省境内的长江同马大堤望江县六合圩段突然发生严重窝陷，省内有关人员迅速奔赴现场，组织力量奋力抢险。
    12月3日上午11时，长江同马大堤六合圩段距堤脚50米处地面突然窝陷。至4日，窝崩长达234.5米，窝顶边缘延及长江堤脚，堤身17米高程处出现裂缝，而且不断延伸，形成2.3万多平方米的窝状塌陷区。专家们认为，这次窝崩面积之大，速度之快，均属多年来罕见。
