    According to a report from Lebanon's "People's Radio," Lebanon today lodged an urgent complaint with the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel's continuous attacks on its southern territory over the past three days.

    The report states that Lebanon has instructed its permanent representative to the United Nations, Rashid Fahouri, to declare to the Security Council that if Israel persists in its inhumane actions in southern Lebanon, Lebanon reserves the right to request a Security Council meeting.

    According to the report, Israel continued to shell the Nabatiyeh area and its surroundings in southern Lebanon today, killing 4 people and injuring at least 16. Meanwhile, Israeli military aircraft repeatedly violated the airspace over this region this morning.
