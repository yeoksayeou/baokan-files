Recently, the Item County Commission for Discipline Inspection, in collaboration with relevant departments, formed an investigation team and entered Niutan Village in Wangmingkou Township. They uncovered an economic case involving illegal activities amounting to 220,000 yuan. This case involved eight village cadres and five county and township officials.

Niutan Village has a population of 2,700 and 7,000 mu of arable land. Before 1985, the village collectively operated a printing factory with an annual output value of nearly 100,000 yuan. The village also had 600 mu of orchards, providing substantial income. The villagers lived in peace. Later, the village's production and the villagers' lives began to decline. Machinery and equipment were lost, factory buildings were destroyed, fruit trees were uprooted, grain yields decreased year by year, and per capita income continued to fall.

Why did Niutan Village fall into such a state? The investigation revealed that the village's leadership was a group of corrupt and irresponsible individuals.

Embezzlement. In the expenditure accounts of 1987 and 1988 alone, there were 42,000 yuan in unaccounted expenses, which were self-written, self-approved, and self-reported by the village cadres. The village party branch secretary, Niu Fengtang, once submitted a reimbursement of 4,600 yuan with a blank receipt. From the accounts, it was found that village cadres embezzled public funds amounting to 250,000 yuan.

Reselling. Niu Fengtang and others sold the village's printing factory machinery and collective tractors. They even resold and privately divided 11,500 kilograms of the village's collective grain.

Deductions. The civil affairs department issued 300 yuan in relief funds to the village's five-guarantee household, Sun Muxuan. After Niu Fengtang received the funds, he quietly pocketed them. Whenever there were festivals or holidays, relief grain and funds for the five-guarantee households and impoverished households, as well as subsidies for revolutionary veterans and military families, were deducted by the village cadres after being transferred.

Seizing. Niu Fengtang, relying on his authority, contracted 11 households' tobacco fields. Both parties agreed that Niu Fengtang would pay 450 yuan per mu to the household heads. When it came time to pay the contract fee in the fall, he either paid less, did not pay at all, or only issued a blank receipt. The deputy secretary of the party branch, Chen Yongbin, wanted to seize more residential land, but faced opposition from the villagers, resulting in 36 mu of arable land being left fallow. Later, this piece of land was seized by Niu Fengtang.

Feasting. Usually, village cadres would host banquets for both public and private matters, treating guests and friends with alcohol and meat. Their relatives and friends all participated. Village cadres had accounts in five restaurants on the street. When village cadres and their relatives went out, they would eat and drink in these restaurants, taking and carrying away items, with all expenses recorded in the village's accounts. From 1986 to 1988, the village spent 31,300 yuan on feasting.

Misuse. For every festival, meeting, grain collection, fund distribution, drought relief, flood control, ditch digging, and road repair, village cadres could demand bonuses and "hardship fees." The least they would get was a few dozen yuan, and the most was over a hundred yuan. Additionally, when village cadres' families got married, had children, buried the dead, or even when a cow gave birth or a sow had piglets, the village had to pay to rent a movie. It was found that Niutan Village still owed 9,000 yuan in movie rental fees.

The main reasons for the situation in Niutan Village's leadership are:

The rectification and financial audit were mere formalities. Niu Fengtang had used public funds for feasting. At the beginning of the rectification and financial audit, he was afraid of being investigated, but later he received no punishment, so he became even more brazen. Under his influence, the village's leadership gradually slid into the abyss.

The organizational life system was not sound. Over the years, the Niutan Party branch had not held a single party member meeting, organized a single organizational life meeting, or recruited a single party member. The two years' party dues for the village's 66 party members and the one year's dues for 105 league members were all paid with public funds. The party's organizational life system was in a state of paralysis.

The masses were kept in the dark. Upper-level documents did not reach the village, party newspapers did not reach the masses, and party policies were swallowed by the village cadres. The village's 15,500 kilograms of grain-for-fertilizer and 6,000 kilograms of grain-for-oil were all embezzled by the village cadres, and the masses were unaware. From 1983 to 1988, 9,325 yuan in national savings bonds purchased by villagers were stolen by the village cadres, and the masses were also unaware.

Accounting management was chaotic. Each village cadre had their own account book. When the investigation team checked the accounts, each of them brought a large bundle of vouchers. Among the 396 vouchers from 1987 to April 12, 1989, 355 were blank receipts. Niu Fengtang also altered four original reimbursement vouchers, adding 7,720 yuan.

Township cadres were also corrupt. During his tenure as township head in Wangmingkou Township, Deputy Director of the County Agricultural Commission, Lu Shulì, embezzled 4,800 yuan in wheat fire insurance funds in one instance. Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, Xie Shiqui, accepted a large amount of money and goods during his father's funeral. The township family planning guidance station's Wang Duanzhou, during his work in Niutan on family planning, colluded with Niu Fengtang to sell 55 "re-examination and sterilization certificates," privately dividing the proceeds. Usually, Niu Fengtang would treat township leaders to meals and gifts; at critical moments, township leaders would support Niu Fengtang. In a party committee meeting in early 1989, someone proposed removing Niu Fengtang from his position as the village party branch secretary, but most of the nine committee members present not only disagreed but also praised Niu Fengtang's achievements.

Under the direct leadership of the Item County Party Committee and the county government, the Wangmingkou Township Party Committee and township government have been reorganized. At the same time, Niu Fengtang, Chen Yongbin, Lu Shulì, Xie Shiqui, and others have been punished according to party discipline, administrative discipline, and legal discipline.

The facts of the corrupt governance by the leadership of Niutan Village raise the question: How can we build the village party branch into a strong fighting fortress?

### 牛滩村干部为政不廉　项城县纪委严肃查处

    牛滩村干部为政不廉　项城县纪委严肃查处
    最近，我地区项城县纪委会同有关部门组成调查组，进驻王明口乡牛滩村，查获一起违法违纪金额达22万元的经济案件。此案涉及8名村干部和5名县乡干部。
    牛滩村有2700口人，7000亩可耕地。1985年前，集体办有印刷厂，年产值近10万元；村有果园600亩，收益尚丰。群众生活安定。后来，村里的生产和群众的生活开始走下坡路。机器设备没了，厂房毁了，果林根梢不留，粮食产量逐年下降，人均收入越来越低。
    为什么牛滩村会变成这样呢？调查证实，这个村的领导班子成员是一群为政不廉的败家子。
    贪污。仅1987年和1988年的开支帐目中，是村干部自写自批自报的白条子就有4.2万元。村党支部书记牛凤堂一次就白条子报销4600元。从帐面上可以查到，村干部贪污公款达2.5万元。
    倒卖。牛凤堂等人把村印刷厂的机器、集体的拖拉机都倒卖了，连村集体的1.15万公斤粮食也被他们倒卖私分。
    克扣。民政部门发给村五保户孙目宣300元的救济款，牛凤堂代领回来后，悄悄装进了自己的腰包。凡逢年过节，上级发给五保户、困难户的救济粮款、烈军属的补助等，经牛滩村干部一转手，都要扣下一部分。
    霸占。牛凤堂依仗权势承包了11户村民的烟叶地。双方商定，每亩地牛凤堂需支付户主450元承包金。到秋后支付承包金时，他不是少给，就是不给，或仅开一张白条子。党支部副书记陈永斌想多占宅基地，遭到村民反对，致使36亩可耕地荒芜。后来，这片土地被牛凤堂占为己有。
    吃喝。平时，村干部公事私事都要拉桌摆宴，接客送友都要酒肉相待，他们的亲朋好友都参加。村干部在街上的5家饭馆挂有帐户，村干部和他们的亲属上街时，都在这些饭馆大吃大喝，走时又拿又带，用款统统记在村的帐户上。1986年至1988年，村里支出的吃喝款达3.13万元。
    滥用。干部过一次节、开一次会、催一次粮、派一次款，抗一次旱、排一次涝、挖一次沟、修一次路，都可以要一次奖金、捞一笔“辛苦费”，少者几十元，多者上百元。另外，村干部家娶媳妇、生孩子、安葬人，甚至黄牛下犊，母猪生崽，都要村里出钱租看电影。经查，牛滩村尚欠电影费9000多元。
    造成牛滩村领导班子这种状况的主要原因是：
    整党清财走过场。牛凤堂曾利用公款大吃大喝。在整党清财开始时，他怕挨整，可是后来他没有受到任何处分，因此更加肆无忌惮起来。在他的影响下，村领导班子成员都逐步地滑进了深渊。
    组织生活制度不健全。几年来，牛滩党支部没有开一次党员大会，没有过一次组织生活会，没有发展一名党员。全村66名党员的两年党费、105名团员的一年团费，都是用公款缴纳的。党的组织生活制度陷入瘫痪状态。
    群众被蒙在鼓里。上级文件发不到村里，党的报刊送不到群众手中，党的方针政策被村干部吞食了。全村1.55万公斤粮奖化肥、0.6万公斤粮奖柴油，全被村干部私吞，群众都不知道。1983年至1988年村民购买的9325元国库券，村干部窃为己有，群众也不清楚。
    帐目管理混乱。村干部每人手里都管着一本帐。当调查组查帐时，他们每人抱来一大包单据。在1987年至1989年4月12日的396张单据中，白条子占355张。牛凤堂还更改原始报销单据4张，多出款额7720元。
    乡干部为政不廉。县农委副主任卢树礼在王明口乡任乡长期间，一次就贪污小麦防火保险金4800元。乡党委副书记谢世魁在为父亲办理丧事时，大肆接收钱物。乡计划生育辅导站的王端领在牛滩开展计划生育时，曾伙同牛凤堂出卖“复查结扎证明”55份，得款私分。平时，牛凤堂给乡领导请客送礼；关键时刻，乡领导就为牛凤堂撑腰壮胆。在1989年初的一次党委会上，有人提议免去牛凤堂的村党支部书记职务，而参加会议的9名委员，大部分同志不但不同意，还为牛凤堂评功摆好。
    在项城县委和县政府的直接领导下，王明口乡党委、乡政府已经改组。同时，牛凤堂、陈永斌、卢树礼、谢世魁等人分别受到了党纪、政纪、法纪的惩处。
    牛滩村领导干部为政不廉的事实，给人们提出了这样一个问题：怎样才能把农村党支部建成坚强的战斗堡垒？
