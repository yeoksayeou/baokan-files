The car sped from Kiev to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, 130 kilometers away. Along the way, a colleague from *Pravda* shared some anecdotes about the severe accident at the power plant: due to radiation, some plants have mutated in shape; there is no hunting around the plant, and wild animals have increased; the word "Chernobyl" originally refers to a bitter-tasting grass, and someone even found this word in the Bible as a sign of disaster...

	30-kilometer Evacuation Zone

The car stopped at a checkpoint guarded by a soldier. This is the entrance to the 30-kilometer evacuation zone centered on the power plant. Three years ago, 110,000 residents were evacuated from here. Now, the entry and exit of vehicles and personnel are strictly controlled to prevent the spread of radioactive contaminants. Under the guidance of a car with indicator lights, we quickly arrived at Chernobyl. This was once a picturesque small town, previously little-known, now famous worldwide. Now, most of the buildings in the town are empty, and the streets are unusually quiet. Some workers temporarily use some thoroughly disinfected buildings to clear nuclear contamination. Along the street, you can occasionally see some cylindrical radiation detectors, reminding people that the aftermath of the nuclear accident has not been completely eliminated.

The organization responsible for clearing the aftermath of the accident is a "Joint Organization" under the Ministry of Atomic Energy. A responsible person from the organization said to the reporter in a wooden building: "I welcome you to this unfortunate land of Chernobyl."

At 1:23 AM on April 26, 1986, an explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant's Unit 4 woke the residents of Pripyat. Due to human error, the unit exploded, releasing a large amount of radiation, scattering highly radioactive debris everywhere, causing widespread contamination, and affecting neighboring countries, making it the most serious nuclear accident in history. Radioactive dust and gases wandered like an "invisible death." The entire Soviet Union mobilized to do two things: first, stop the already ruptured reactor from continuing to release radioactive materials and prevent a high-temperature-induced nuclear chain reaction; second, immediately evacuate residents within a 30-kilometer radius and decontaminate contaminated land, forests, buildings, etc. The first task was completed by October of that year. The second task is still ongoing.

	Inside and Outside the "Dead City"

From Chernobyl, we transferred to a car from the "Joint Organization" and headed to Pripyat, 18 kilometers away. Along the way, there were pine forests and birch forests. The host said that due to the influence of radiation, the new pine needles that grew after the accident were longer than usual, and some plants and flowers had abnormally large buds. Along the way, you can occasionally see some abandoned farming tools. These items will be buried in a permanent "grave." Some orchards have also become waste. The pine forests seen near the power plant were all yellow, victims of strong radiation.

Pripyat, established in 1970, has become a "dead city." Most of the buildings in this city of about 50,000 people are no longer habitable. The car passed by the cultural palace, hotel, kindergarten, shops... and occasionally saw unfinished construction projects. Now, the city is deserted and silent. "When will the owner return?" The answer is: "Maybe in 50 or 70 years."

The noteworthy Unit 4 reactor has been sealed in a "sarcophagus." After the accident, this reactor with an open roof was described as "a wounded beast emitting poison." Many helicopters dropped 5,000 tons of cooling and radiation-absorbing materials onto the reactor. Then, using remotely controlled mechanical devices with strange shapes, a protective cover was built for the reactor, stopping the continued release of radioactive materials and preventing a more serious situation—the occurrence of a nuclear chain reaction. This 70-meter-high "sarcophagus" is said to need to be sealed for at least 100,000 years.

Dealing with such a large-scale nuclear accident, humanity has no experience. Clearing radioactive contamination over a thousand square kilometers is no easy task. Large areas of forests need to be cut down and buried deep underground in "graves"; liquid synthetic rubber is sprayed onto large areas of forests and buildings to stick to radioactive dust, then solidified into strip-like solids, rolled into bundles, and buried in "graves"; remotely controlled giant bulldozers scrape off the contaminated surface soil and "bury" it; to prevent radioactive materials from seeping into rivers with groundwater, cement walls 30 meters deep and 3 kilometers long were built along the river... This work is indeed unique and unprecedented in history.

	Scientific Experiment Base

What long-term effects will a serious nuclear accident have on the ecosystem and residents' health? Why do blackberries absorb more radiation than other berries? Why can tomatoes harvested after the accident be eaten after just a wash? It is known that some microorganisms, such as mushrooms, can absorb large amounts of radioactive elements, so can they be used to purify contaminated fields for replanting? Are the animals here edible? Is their fur clean? Is there any mutation in their reproduction? These questions have attracted the interest of scientists in the Soviet Union and around the world. More than 100 research institutes from across the country have gathered here. 1,200 scientists from 47 countries have visited here. An international research center has been established here.

The reporter visited a large greenhouse in Pripyat. This greenhouse has become a production and research base. The cucumbers grown here are two to three times larger than usual due to radiation stimulation. The potato seeds grown here have strong disease resistance.

	"The City of the 21st Century"

On the way back to Kiev from the power plant, we visited a new city built specifically for power plant workers. About 50 kilometers northeast of the power plant, a small city named Slavutych has risen in the embrace of lush pine forests. This is the youngest city in the Soviet Union, built in less than two years. The various buildings in the city were constructed by 8 republics, each with its own national characteristics. Standing on the newly paved asphalt road and looking around, it feels like being in an exhibition center for Azerbaijani, Georgian, Latvian, Armenian, and other national architectures.

Since the first commercial nuclear power plant appeared in the world 35 years ago, there have been more than 400 nuclear power plants in operation worldwide, providing 16% of the world's total electricity. The Chernobyl accident tells people that nuclear energy can both benefit humanity and bring risks. The disaster at Chernobyl was caused by the operators' serious lack of responsibility and negligence. Six mistakes led to the great disaster, paying a heavy price. However, as long as there is a scientific attitude that strictly follows natural laws and a meticulous professional spirit, nuclear power can be tamed to serve humanity. In this sense, the bloody lesson of Chernobyl should be a common asset for the whole world.

专栏：出访归来

    今日切尔诺贝利
    本报记者　张允文
    汽车离开基辅后向130公里外的切尔诺贝利核电站疾驰。一路上，《真理报》同行讲述关于该核电站发生严重事故后的趣闻：由于辐射影响，一些植物形态变异；电站周围无人狩猎，野兽激增；“切尔诺贝利”一词本意是一种味苦的草，有人竟在《圣经》中发现此词是灾难的征兆……
          30公里疏散区
    车子在一个军人看守的检查口停下。这就是以电站为中心、半径30公里疏散区的入口。3年前从这里疏散了11万居民。现在车辆人员的出入受到严格控制，以防放射性污染物的扩散。我们在一辆有指示灯的汽车前导下很快就到了切尔诺贝利。这本是一座景色迷人的小城，过去鲜为人知，如今已名传全球。现在，小城中多数建筑物是空的，街上显得格外宁静。一些清除核污染人员暂时使用一些经过彻底消毒的建筑物。街旁时而可见一些筒状的放射线测量仪，它提示着人们：核事故的后果尚未完全消除。
    负责清除事故后果的是原子能源部下属的一个“联合机构”。机构的一名负责人在一座木建筑内对记者说的头一句话是：“我在这块多灾多难的切尔诺贝利土地上向您表示欢迎。”
    1986年4月26日凌晨，一声巨响把电站所在地普里皮亚特市的人们从睡梦中惊醒。核电站第4号机组由于人为错误发生爆炸，大量放射物外泄，强辐射的碎片到处散落，造成大面积污染，殃及苏联的邻国，成为世界核电史上最严重的事故。放射尘埃与气体像“看不见的死神”到处游荡。苏联全国动员做两件事：一、制止已炸裂的反应堆继续泄放放射性物质并防止超高温引发核连锁反应；二、立即对半径30公里内的居民进行紧急疏散并对污染的土地、森林、建筑物等进行消毒。第一项工作当年10月就已完成。第二项工作至今仍在进行。
                “死城”内外
    从切尔诺贝利改乘“联合机构”的汽车驶往18公里外的普里皮亚特市的路上，松林、白桦林不断。主人说，由于辐射的影响，事故后新长出的松针比通常的长，一些植物、花卉的苞蕾也异常肥大。沿路不时可见一些被遗弃的农具。这些东西将被埋入永久的“墓穴”。一些果园也成为废物。快到电站时看到的松林都是焦黄的，这是强辐射的牺牲品。
    建立于1970年的普里皮亚特市已成为一座“死城”。这座人口约5万的小城中绝大部分建筑物已不能住人。车子驶经文化宫、宾馆、幼儿园、商店……偶而可见尚未完工的工程。如今人走楼空，一片死寂。“主人何日再来？”回答是：“也许50年或70年以后。”
    引人注目的第4号反应堆已被封闭在一具“石棺”中。事故发生后，这个开了天窗的反应堆被形容为“一头受了伤的野兽，散发出毒素”。大批直升飞机向这个反应堆扔下了5000吨降温、吸放射性元素物质，然后用形状奇特的遥控机械为反应堆修筑了一个绝缘罩，从而制止了放射物的继续外泄，防止了更严重的事态——核连锁反应的发生。这具高70米的“石棺”，据说，至少要关闭10万年。
    对付如此规模的核事故，人类尚无经验。在一千平方公里的范围内清除放射性污染，谈何容易。大片森林要砍掉并埋入很深的地下“墓穴”；向大面积的森林、建筑物撒泼液状合成橡胶，粘住放射性尘埃，然后凝结成带状固体，再卷成捆，埋入“坟墓”；用遥控的巨型推土机把污染的表层土铲掉并“埋葬”；为了防止放射性物质随地下水渗入河流，沿河修筑了深入地下30米、长3公里的水泥墙……这种工作确实是独特的、史无前例的。
          科学实验基地
    严重的核事故对生态、居民健康将造成何种长远影响？为什么茶蔗子比别的浆果吸收辐射多得多？为什么事故后收获的西红柿只要洗一下即可食用？已知一些微生物，如蘑菇能大量吸收放射性元素，那么能否利用它们净化核污染的田地使之重新适于种植？这里的动物能否食用？皮毛是否干净？它们生殖有无变异？诸多问题引起了苏联和世界科学界的兴趣。全国100多个研究所的科学家云集于此。47国1200名科学家来此访问。这里建立了国际科研中心。
    记者在普里皮亚特市参观了一个大型温室。这个温室已成为生产、科研基地。这里培植的黄瓜由于受辐射的刺激，比通常的大两三倍。这里培植的土豆种子具有抗病力强的特性。
            “21世纪的城市”
    从电站回基辅途中参观了一座专为电站职工新建的城市。离电站东北方向50公里处，青翠松林环抱中已屹立一座名叫斯拉乌捷奇的小城。这是在不到两年的时间内拔地而起的、苏联国土上最年轻的城市。市内各种房屋由8个加盟共和国承建，各具民族特色。站在刚铺设的柏油马路上环顾四周，犹如置身于阿塞拜疆、格鲁吉亚、拉脱维亚、亚美尼亚等民族建筑的展览中心。
    自从35年前世界上出现第一座商业性核电站以来，世界上已有400多座核电站在运转，提供全世界总发电量的16％。切尔诺贝利事故告诉人们，核能既可以造福于人类，也会带来风险。切尔诺贝利发生的灾难是操作人员严重缺乏责任心、疏于职守造成的。6项错误铸成了大祸，付出了惨重的代价。然而，只要有严格遵循自然规律的科学态度和一丝不苟的敬业精神，核电是完全可以驯服地服务于人类的。从这个意义上说，切尔诺贝利的血的教训应当成为全世界的共同财富。（附图片）
      图为切尔诺贝利核电站第4号机组。为防止这个炸裂的反应堆继续外泄放射物，抢救人员在顶上抢修了保护罩。不少人为此献出了生命，包括辐射探测特别小组副组长斯达洛莫夫、苏联英雄安多什金少将。
