In the midst of winter, with cold winds blowing, the alleys and residential areas in Hangzhou City are adorned with clusters of winter jasmine, cherry blossoms, and red spires, all vying for attention with their vibrant colors.

These alleys and residential areas with small parks were built in recent years, with over 20 already completed in the city. The Hangzhou Municipal Government has adopted a public-private partnership approach to solve the funding issue; residents have taken the initiative to lay out lawns and add fake mountains, fish ponds, fountains, and stone benches. Just in the Xiacheng District's Yaoping Lane and Xinqiao residential areas, over 50,000 yuan was spent on greening and building small parks last year. Since this year, Hangzhou City has expanded its greening area by 314,700 square meters, a significant portion of which are street parks. Residents of Hangzhou have also built "rooftop gardens."

    杭州街道里弄建小公园
    新华社杭州12月12日电　（记者吴克强、通讯员李文）时值隆冬，寒风飕飕，但在杭州市的一些里弄和住宅区小公园里，一丛丛腊梅、樱花、一串红等树木花卉依然争奇斗艳。
    这些里弄和住宅区小公园都是近几年建成的，全市已有20多个。杭州市人民政府采取民办公助的办法解决资金问题；自己动手，布置草坪，并缀以假山、鱼池、喷泉、石凳等。仅下城区窑瓶巷、新桥两个居民区，去年用于绿化和建设小公园的经费就达5万多元。今年以来，杭州市城区扩大绿化面积31.47万平方米，其中相当一部分是街道小公园。杭州市居民还筑起“屋顶花园”。
