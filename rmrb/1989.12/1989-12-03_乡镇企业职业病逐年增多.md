With the development of production and the rise of township enterprises, the number of occupational diseases has been increasing in recent years due to neglect of labor protection and dust and poison prevention measures. Last year, 17 workers at the Lixin Electrical Switch Factory in Zhaozhuang Township, Qingpu County, Shanghai, were found to have silicosis; 11 cases of silicosis were reported at the Detergent Film Factory in Zhoupu Township, Nanhui County. Among the sick workers, the youngest was 27 years old, and the average age was 46; the shortest working period before onset was just 7 months, with an average of 5.16 years. The Shulong Sand Powder Factory in Fengxi Township, Qingpu County, took on the processing of aluminum-containing abrasives from the Shanghai Abrasives and Grinding Tools Factory, resulting in 5 cases of aluminum dust lung disease this year. Shanghai Asbestos Factory discovered 15 cases of asbestosis this year. The Lixin Shoe Factory in Yancang Township, Nanhui County, processes shoe uppers for the Shanghai Baolv Shoe Factory, using pure benzene as a solvent to prepare glue. Workers in the enclosed workshop without any ventilation or decontamination worked 10-14 hours a day, resulting in 8 cases of benzene poisoning. Among them, 5 workers suffered from severe poisoning with aplastic anemia, and a 21-year-old female worker died from severe aplastic anemia. A paint factory in Shanghai transferred the production of red lead and yellow lead, which contain more than 80% lead, to a township enterprise in a certain county, leading to an increase in the incidence of lead poisoning among workers. Additionally, a construction team, without any ventilation or decontamination facilities and personal protective equipment, applied an anti-corrosion agent to the inner walls of a two-phase sludge digestion tank for a sewage treatment plant. As a result, 8 workers were poisoned, with 2 fatalities.

The main reasons for the significant increase in the incidence of occupational diseases in Shanghai are that some toxic and harmful factories, when "downsizing" or "dispersing" their products, also transfer the hazards to township enterprises; some township enterprises have limited funds, factory space, and equipment, and while production continues to expand, labor protection measures have not kept up. To address this issue, it is first necessary to strengthen propaganda and education. Furthermore, industrial and mining enterprises should conduct preventive health supervision during expansion, renovation, and new construction, including labor protection projects in the design. Approval should not be granted if the conditions are not met.

    乡镇企业职业病逐年增多
    在生产发展和乡镇企业兴起的同时，由于忽视了劳动保护和防尘防毒措施，近年来职业病的发病数有上升的趋势。上海青浦县赵屯乡立新电器开关厂去年经查，有17名工人患矽肺病；南汇县周浦乡涤纶薄膜厂去年有11例矽肺病。患病工人中，年龄最小的27岁，平均46岁；发病工龄最短者仅7个月，平均5.16年。青浦县凤溪乡叙龙砂粉厂承接上海磨料磨具厂含铝磨料加工业务，今年造成5例铝尘肺。上海石棉厂今年发现石棉肺15例。南汇县盐仓乡立新皮鞋厂为上海宝屐皮鞋厂加工鞋帮，用纯苯作溶剂配制粘胶，工人在无任何通风排毒的密闭车间中每天工作10—14小时，造成苯中毒8例。其中重度中毒伴再生障碍性贫血患者5名，一名21岁女工因严重“再障”死亡。上海市区某造漆厂将含铅量达80％以上的红丹粉和黄丹粉生产转嫁给某县一乡镇企业，造成工人铅中毒发病率上升。还有某施工队在无任何通风排毒设施和个人防护用具的情况下，为某污水处理厂的二相污泥消化池内壁喷涂防腐蚀剂，结果8人全部中毒，其中2人死亡。
    造成上海市职业病发病率大幅度上升的原因主要是一些有毒有害厂在“下放”、“扩散”产品时，将毒害一并下放、扩散给乡镇企业；一些乡镇企业资金、厂房、设备有限，生产不断延伸，劳动保护却未跟上去。解决这个问题，首先要加强宣传教育。另外，工矿企业在扩建、改建、新建中，应进行预防性卫生监督工作，设计中应有劳动保护项目，不具备条件者不能给予批准。
