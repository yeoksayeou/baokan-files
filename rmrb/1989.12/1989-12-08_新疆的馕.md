Title: Flatbread from Xinjiang

Even I find it strange: how did a "Hubei native" born in Wuhan come to love the flatbread from Xinjiang?

Back when I was a new recruit, often called a "newbie" by the veterans, one day, the political instructor took me to visit a herder's home. The host warmly offered us flatbread and roasted mutton. At the time, I secretly frowned—how could I swallow such a dry, hard flatbread? Under the host's enthusiastic invitation, I, out of politeness, took a small piece of flatbread and put it in my mouth. As I chewed, I thought, "Hmm, it's crispy and flaky, with a unique flavor." I ended up eating until I was full. Curiously, I asked the host, Uncle Manglik, how this flatbread, which didn't look like much, tasted so good. Uncle Manglik laughed heartily but didn't answer my question directly. He just told me that flatbread is usually made from wheat flour, but sometimes cornmeal or sorghum flour is used. When making flatbread, milk and vegetable oil are added to the dough, which is then kneaded and shaped. Sesame seeds and green onions are sprinkled on the surface, and then the flatbread is baked in a tandoor heated with firewood. When the flames are about to die out, a little salt water is applied to the back of the flatbread, which is then stuck to the wall of the tandoor to bake in the remaining embers...

Listening to Uncle Manglik talk about the process of making flatbread, I understood a truth: everything delicious in the world is proportional to the enthusiasm and care people put into it.

A few years later, while running errands in town, I happened to see Uncle Manglik selling flatbread. He recognized me: "Ha, great! You've become an officer. Please sit down." He told me that the pasture had been contracted out, and he was raising several hundred sheep and dozens of cows. Now, during the winter, he couldn't graze the animals, so he used this free time to sell flatbread. I asked him how much money he could make selling flatbread in a day. Uncle Manglik laughed and patted his pocket: "Money? There's plenty. If I just stay at home, it's boring. Coming to the city to sell flatbread is mainly to see the world. Flatbread is also a traditional food of the Uyghur people. I want to do this and let people of other ethnicities like it too." Uncle Manglik said, gesturing with his hands. I noticed the flatbreads in the wooden cabinet, many of which had unfamiliar shapes, and asked, "Why are these flatbreads different?"

Uncle Manglik stroked his chin, his face glowing with pride: "They have different names, so of course they look different." He then introduced the large flatbreads, called "Haimeike" and "Xirenman," which are mainly eaten during festivals and celebrations. The smaller flatbreads, called "Tuaqi" and "Katiqiman," are convenient to carry and are often taken as travel food. The thick flatbread called "Gerdan" and the thin flatbread called "Haicimeike" are everyday foods for the Uyghur people. There are also meat-filled flatbreads...

I had to hurry to catch the local bus back to the unit, so I quickly said goodbye to Uncle Manglik. Uncle Manglik chased after me and insisted on giving me six pieces of "Tuaqi" and "Katiqiman," saying they would bring good luck. I just took it as a joke.

The bus struggled through the snowstorm, taking two extra hours. After getting off the bus, I still had to walk 11 kilometers. Everything in front of me was blurry. I took deep, shallow steps, facing the bone-chilling wind, searching for shelter. My stomach rumbled, and the hungrier I got, the colder I felt, and the harder it was to walk. "Plop," I fell into the snow. My hand instinctively touched the flatbread Uncle Manglik had given me, and my heart lit up. I stood up, took a bite—it was crispy, and another bite—it was fragrant. I picked up a handful of snow and put it in my mouth, which was refreshing! This back-and-forth made my stomach warm up...

This was the first time I had a wild picnic, a truly unforgettable wild picnic.

Every time I go out on business or visit my hometown, I buy a certain amount of flatbread. Because it has little water, it doesn't get moldy, and it can be eaten after soaking in water and baking. Even in a waterless and fireless desert, if you bury the flatbread in the sand for a few minutes, it can become soft and delicious. Every time I return to my hometown of Wuhan, I still can't forget the flatbread from Xinjiang. Although Wuhan's snacks are abundant, I always feel that nothing compares to the flavor of Xinjiang flatbread.

    新疆的馕
    尹广
    连我自己也感到奇怪：一个出生在武汉的“湖北佬”，怎么会喜欢上新疆的馕？
    还在我被老兵们称之为“新兵蛋子”时，一天，指导员领着我到牧民家做客。主人热情地拿出了馕和烤羊肉招待我们。当时我暗自皱眉头——这么干硬的饼子怎么咽得下？在主人盛情地邀请下，我出于礼貌象征性地弄了一小块馕放到嘴里。嚼着嚼着，咦，又酥又脆，味道别致，竟吃得直打饱嗝才罢休。我好奇地问主人芒力克大叔，这馕看起来不咋样，吃起来还是蛮有味道的，原因何在？芒力克哈哈大笑后，没有正面回答我的问题，只是告诉我，饼通常用白面烤制，也有用玉米面或高粱米面做的。做馕时，和面加入一定比例的牛奶、清油，再揉拍成型，并在馕的表面撒上芝麻和葱花，然后点燃柴火将烤馕坑烧热。待火苗快要熄灭时，将馕的背面抹少许盐水贴到馕坑内的坑壁上，使馕在柴火的余烬中直接烤热……
    听着芒力克侃侃而谈馕的制作过程，我明白了这样一个道理：世界上一切好吃的东西，都与人们赋予的热情和精心的多少成正比吧。
    几年后，我上街办事，偶然发现芒力克在做烤馕生意。他认出了我：“哈哈，亚克西，当上了军官，请坐。”他告诉我，牧场实行了承包，他放养几百余头羊、几十头牛。现在冬季，不能放牧，利用这个空闲时间做做烤馕生意。我问他卖馕一天能挣多少钱？芒力克哈哈一笑，拍拍腰间的兜：“钱嘛，多着呢，闲在家里嘛，难受；到市里卖卖馕，主要是嘛，见见世面。馕嘛，也是我们维吾尔民族的一个传统，我愿意做这件事，让别的民族同志都喜欢吃它。”芒力克说着，比划着。我留意看了摆在木柜里的馕，发现许多陌生的面孔，问道：“这些馕怎么不一样呵？”芒力克摸摸下巴，脸上泛着红光：“它们的姓名不一样，当然长得也不一样。”接着介绍大的馕，名字叫“海买克”“细热曼”，主要在过节和办喜事的时候吃。个子小的馕叫“吐阿奇”、“卡提力芒”，因便于携带，被大伙当作外出的干粮；比面包还厚的“格尔旦”、比烙饼还薄的“海依菜克”，是维吾尔族人的家常饭食，还有夹馅的肉馕……
    我因急着乘地方班车赶回部队，匆匆与芒力克告别。芒力克追上我，硬是塞给我六张“吐阿奇”和“卡提力芒”，说是带上它可以逢凶化吉，我只是当作玩笑听听而已。
    班车在风雪中艰难爬行。结果在路上多走了两个小时。下了班车，还得走11公里路。眼前混沌一片，我深一脚，浅一步，迎着刺骨寒风，寻找归宿。肚子叽咕作响，越饿身上越冷，越冷步子越难迈。“噗嗤”一下，我摔在雪地里，手下意识地触摸到芒力克送的馕，心中一喜，爬起来，咬了一口，很脆，又一口，很香；从地上抓起一把雪，送进口里，真清凉！这么来回折腾，肚里升起一股热浪……这是我有生以来吃的一顿野餐，真正的野餐，永生难忘的野餐。
    每每外出公差或回家探亲，我都买上一定数量的馕。因为它的水分少，不怕干，不发霉，遇水有火，一泡一烤就能吃，即便走在无水无火的沙漠地带，只要把馕埋在沙窝里捂几分钟，也可以变得酥软可口。我每每回到家乡武汉，仍忘不了新疆的馕。尽管武汉小吃堪称丰富，可我总感觉没有新疆馕那么有滋有味……
