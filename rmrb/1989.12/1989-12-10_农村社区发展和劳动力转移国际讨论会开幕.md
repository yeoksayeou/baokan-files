The international academic symposium on rural community development and labor force transfer opened at the Beijing Hotel this morning. Correspondent Gu Yuqing reports: Today, representatives from around the world gathered to discuss the pressing issues facing rural communities and labor force migration. Attendees included Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Fei Xiaotong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gu Mu, Minister of Agriculture He Kang, and Mr. Laquian from the United Nations Population Fund's office in China. Nearly 20 foreign experts, scholars, and representatives from various regions of China participated in the meeting, totaling approximately 200 people.

In their speeches, the representatives emphasized that population issues are a global concern, and rural development is a shared interest among all nations. In developing countries, these two issues are particularly prominent and intertwined. Addressing rural community development, labor force transfer, population control, and population migration are crucial challenges for developing countries. Rural areas are a vital part of society, and rural issues must be addressed with the attention of the entire society and considered within the broader context of social development to find effective solutions.

During the symposium, scholars from various countries exchanged and discussed their research findings on rural issues.

This academic symposium was organized by the China International Cultural Exchange Center.

    农村社区发展和劳动力转移国际讨论会开幕
    本报北京12月9日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天上午，农村社区发展和劳动力转移国际学术讨论会在北京饭店开幕。全国人大常委会副委员长费孝通、政协副主席谷牧、农业部部长何康、联合国人口基金会驻华代表处拉奎安先生以及近20名外国专家、学者和来自全国各地的中国代表共约200人参加了会议。
    代表们在发言中指出，人口问题是一个世界性的问题，农村发展是世界各国共同关心的问题。在发展中国家，这两个问题既突出又相互交织在一起。如何解决农村社区发展和人口产业转移、人口控制和人口迁移等问题，是发展中国家面临的重要课题。农村是社会的重要组成部分，农村问题只有引起全社会的关注并放在社会的全局中去考察才能找到正确的解决方法和途径。
    在讨论会上，各国学者还就农村问题方面的研究成果进行交流与探讨。
    这次学术讨论会是中国国际文化交流中心举办的。
