Zhang Xinghui, the director of the Vasculitis Prevention and Treatment Research Institute in the suburbs of Jining City, Shandong Province, has made significant breakthroughs in the research on a new method for treating vasculitis. The method recently passed provincial-level appraisal.

The research on the new method for treating vasculitis was included in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key research projects by Shandong Province in 1986. Clinical results over three years show that out of 200 treated patients, the cure rate reached 93%, surpassing both domestic and international cure rates.
