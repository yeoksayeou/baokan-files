While some factories are still confused about whether the Party Secretary or the Factory Director is the top leader, the Party Secretaries and Factory Directors of several large factories in Nanning recently told reporters: We don't argue over who is first; as long as the Party and the government are united in mind and follow the policies, we can get through the difficulties.

The Party Secretary of Nanning Canned Food Factory, Zhou Chongzhen, said: I have been the Party Secretary for five years. Looking back, if the Factory Director and I had not thought and acted together, our factory would not have achieved today's results. Last year, we independently exported over 20,000 tons of canned food, and this year the situation is also good. My experience is that as long as the Party Secretary and the Factory Director respect each other, discuss matters first, and reach a consensus before bringing them to the Party and government leadership meetings for discussion, things generally go smoothly.

The Party Secretary of Nanning Tractor Factory, Chen Yang, said: The Factory Director and I were both promoted from the position of Section Chief in 1985, and we are of similar age and experience. We handle factory matters together and have a common language. By last year, under our leadership, the factory has made new strides every year, with production speed increasing by 10% annually. In production and operations, as the Party Secretary, I must ensure the Factory Director's central position and command authority; otherwise, the factory cannot be run well.

The Factory Director of Nanning Cigarette Factory, Luo Yongfeng, said: Our Party Secretary, Tan Jiayou, is a retired military officer. Our approach is to discuss everything first and then collectively discuss and decide in the leadership meetings, adhering to collective leadership.

The leaders of Nanning Watch Factory and Nanning Stainless Steel Pot Factory also shared similar views.

    不争谁是一把手
    只要党政一条心
    南宁一些书记厂长协力办好厂
    据新华社南宁12月11日电  （记者姬乃甫、李东炎）正当一些工厂弄不清书记厂长谁是第一把手的时候，不久前南宁市的几家大厂的书记和厂长对记者说：我们不争谁第一，只要党政一条心，跟着政策走。他们的共同体会是，在当前资金、能源、产品销售不畅的情况下，书记厂长如不齐心协力就无法度过难关。
    南宁罐头厂党委书记邹崇贞说：我当书记五年了，回头想如果我和厂长想不到一起，做不到一起，那我们厂就不能有今天的局面。去年我们自营出口罐头2万多吨，今年情况也不错。我的体会是，工厂的事，只要书记和厂长互相尊重，遇事先商量，意见一致以后再提到党政领导班子的会上讨论，一般情况下是能顺利通过的。
    南宁拖拉机厂党委书记陈阳说：我和厂长都是1985年从科长提上来的，年岁差不多，经历也一样。工厂的事情我们两人都是商量着干的，有共同语言。到去年，在我们的任上，工厂年年迈新步，生产速度每年以10％向前发展。在生产经营上，我这个书记要保证厂长的中心地位，保证他的指挥权，不然工厂就办不好。
    南宁卷烟厂厂长骆永锋说：我们厂的党委书记覃家佑是位转业军人。我们的办法是，凡事两人先商量，然后在领导班子会上集体讨论，集体决策，坚持了集体领导。
    南宁手表厂、南宁钢精锅厂的领导人也谈了类似的看法。
