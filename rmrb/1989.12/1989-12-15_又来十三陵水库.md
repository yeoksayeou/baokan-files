In mid-autumn in Beijing, the sky is high and the air is crisp. I came to the Shisanling Reservoir Management Office, which I had not visited for a long time. Comrade Lao Dai, the person in charge, received me. Knowing that I had come from out of town, he insisted on accompanying me on a tour. We walked and looked around as we went.

This time, I specially brought a set of Shisanling Reservoir photographs and materials, which I had treasured for many years. These were purchased more than 20 years ago at the Dong'an Market in Beijing. I took them out to show Comrade Lao Dai, who was very pleased. The 12 slightly yellowed photographs each vividly depict the moving scenes of the reservoir's construction at that time. That year, my classmates and I from the graduating class came to the reservoir to participate in voluntary labor. Among them, the "Shisanling Reservoir Overall Planning Sketch" was drawn by me and another classmate. To draw this sketch, the command center assigned us to the greening office to assist with the work, allowing us to go down and conduct investigations to collect materials. We drew this sketch based on the planning map. The sketch was drawn on a board about six to seven square meters in size, and after it was completed, a famous painter helped with the artistic modifications. Now, the surrounding areas of the reservoir are lush and green, like a green mountain and water painting. Shisanling Reservoir has become a scenic spot and tourist attraction in the capital, attracting more and more domestic and foreign tourists. Today, we should draw a new Shisanling Reservoir tourist map.

In the exhibition hall, there are several photographs reflecting Chairman Mao and other party and state leaders participating in voluntary labor at the reservoir, as well as a large oil painting replica titled "Chairman Mao Shovels, I Carry." In these works, the leaders' approachable demeanor still feels intimate. The monument standing at the foot of the hill on the eastern side of the dam is particularly majestic and grand against the blue sky and green mountains. At the top of the monument is a sculpture of the reservoir builders, and the base is inscribed with inscriptions from Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, as well as an inscription by Guo Moruo. Many tourists take photos in front of the monument, copy the inscriptions and the inscription, and reminisce about the leaders' great achievements. After sketching the monument, I sat on the steps in front of the monument to rest and chatted with a group of young people. We talked about the scene of Chairman Mao and other leaders coming to the construction site to work that year: It was May 25, 1958, a Sunday afternoon. The loudspeaker broadcast an exciting message: Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and the Politburo members, Central Committee members, and major leaders from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions participating in the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China came to the reservoir construction site to participate in voluntary labor... The entire construction site immediately became excited. At around three in the afternoon, the central leaders arrived at the construction site, almost all of them dressed as ordinary workers. They wore straw hats, coarse cloth clothes, and round-toed cloth shoes. At the invitation of the command center, Chairman Mao personally wrote the five characters "Shisanling Reservoir." Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and Comrade Zhu De also wrote inscriptions. Then, Chairman Mao and the central leaders began to work... At that time, the task of my classmates from the academy was to assist the workers in maintaining the railway and transporting sand and soil to the dam construction site. That day, a few classmates followed the car to the dam construction site and saw Chairman Mao and other central leaders passing through layers of welcoming crowds to participate in labor. An overseas Chinese student pushed his way into the crowd and snapped a rare photo of Chairman Mao shoveling soil. Later, when we saw these precious photos, we all felt particularly intimate...

After a short rest, we strolled on the dam. When I mentioned that the reservoir's water storage was not much, Comrade Lao Dai told me that to open up new water sources, the water replenishment project was completed in August 1986, connecting the Chaobai River and the Wenyu River, two major water systems. Walking to the western end of the dam, I introduced to Comrade Lao Dai that the current management office area on the half hillside was the location of the command center at that time. In addition to various offices, the command center also had a stage, a public canteen, and a broadcasting station. Speaking of the broadcasting station, I recalled an unforgettable incident: One afternoon, I passed by the door of the broadcasting station and saw Premier Zhou and several comrades coming out of the broadcasting station. A female comrade in military uniform followed closely behind. At this time, I slowed my steps and occasionally turned back to gaze at the Premier. I heard the female comrade ask the Premier's entourage if they should broadcast. The Premier immediately turned around and gestured: "Don't broadcast." The Premier wore a loose, light gray Zhongshan suit and a light gray cadre cap, walking straight towards the riverbank. The comrades washing by the flowing water on the riverbank did not notice. When Premier Zhou and his entourage crossed the wooden bridge to the opposite riverbank, they were noticed by some comrades, and everyone stood up, watching the Premier's departing figure.

During the days I helped work at the command center, I also saw many cultural workers come to the construction site to participate in labor and experience life. They slept in tents and ate in the public canteen. The dining tables in the public canteen were wooden boards propped up, and the chairs were broken bricks and wooden stools. Everyone ate at these tables. They created various literary and artistic works reflecting the life of the reservoir with great enthusiasm, performing and exhibiting on the construction site without compensation. On the night the reservoir was completed, dozens of performing troupes from the central government and Beijing City came to the construction site for free performances. As a student about to enter life from a higher art academy, I was immersed in the fiery life of reservoir construction, feeling that it was a good ideological tempering and a good artistic practice. On the construction site, I worked and labored while seizing the time to draw some sketches of the reservoir construction. After returning to the academy, I created a woodcut titled "Night at Shisanling Reservoir." Later, this woodcut, along with some works by others reflecting the reservoir construction, was selected for an international print exhibition and was exhibited in Beijing and Moscow.

Now, facing the picturesque reservoir scenic area, I can't help but fall into deep thought: The spirit of self-reliance and hard work shown in the reservoir construction, the fine tradition of leaders and cadres participating in voluntary labor with the masses, and the style of intellectuals combining with the masses, are these not still needed to be advocated and carried forward today?

    又来十三陵水库
    董其中
    北京仲秋，天高气爽。我来到阔别已久的十三陵水库管理处。负责人老戴同志接待了我，他知道我是从外地来的，执意要陪我参观，我们边走边看。
    这次我特地带去一套十三陵水库照片资料，多年来我一直珍藏它。这是20多年前我在北京东安市场上买得的。我拿出来请老戴同志看，他感到十分惊喜。这12张每张颜色略黄的照片，张张展现出当年水库建设的动人情景。那年，我们毕业班的同学到水库参加义务劳动。其中那张“十三陵水库远景规划示意图”，是我和班里另一同学绘制的。为画这张示意图，指挥部抽调我们到绿化办公室帮助工作，让我们下去作调查收集资料。我们是根据规划图才画出这张示意图的。示意图画在一块大约六、七平方米的板面上的，画成后有位名画家还帮助作了绘画技术上的修改。现在水库四周郁郁葱葱，如同一幅青绿山水画。十三陵水库已成为首都的一个风景区旅游点，吸引着越来越多的国内外游客。今天我们该重新画一幅十三陵水库旅游示意图了。
    陈列馆里有几幅反映毛主席等党和国家领导人在水库参加义务劳动的照片，还有一幅复制的大型油画——《毛主席铲土我来担》。这些作品中，领袖们平易近人的风姿，仍使人感到亲切。竖立在大坝东头山脚下的纪念碑，在蓝天和青山的衬托下，显得格外雄伟壮观。纪念碑顶部是一组水库建设者形象的雕塑，底座四周镌刻着毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德的题词，还有郭沫若撰写的碑文。不少游客在纪念碑前摄影留念，抄写题词和碑文，缅怀领袖们的丰功伟绩。我画了一张纪念碑的速写后，坐在纪念碑前的台阶上小憩，和一伙年轻人交谈，谈到当年毛主席等来到工地劳动的情景：那是1958年5月25日——一个星期日的下午，扩音器里广播出一个振奋人心的消息：毛主席、刘主席、周总理、朱德、邓小平，以及参加八大二次会议的政治局委员、中央委员、各省市区主要负责人到水库工地参加义务劳动……。顿时，整个工地沸腾起来了。下午三点多，中央领导同志来到了工地，差不多每人都是一身普通劳动者的装束。他们头戴草帽，身着粗布衣，脚穿圆口布鞋。应指挥部的邀请，毛主席亲笔题写了“十三陵水库”五个字。刘少奇、周恩来、朱德同志也题了词。随后，毛主席和党中央的领导同志就开始了劳动……当时，我们学院同学的任务是，协助工人维护铁道，给大坝工地运送沙土。那天，有几个同学跟车到了大坝工地，看到了毛主席等党中央领导同志穿过层层欢迎的群众去参加劳动的情景，有个华侨同学挤进人群，抢拍到了毛主席铲土时的镜头。后来我们看到这些难得的照片时，无不感到格外亲切……
    稍息后，我们在大坝上漫步。当我说到库存水不多时，老戴同志告诉我说，为开辟新的水源，1986年8月建成了补水工程，沟通了潮白河、温榆河两大水系。走到大坝西头，我向老戴同志介绍说，半山坡上如今管理处一带，是当时指挥部所在地。指挥部除各种办事机构外，还设有戏台、公共食堂、广播站等。说到广播站，我忆起这样难忘的一件事：一天下午，我路过广播站门口，看到周总理和几位同志从广播站走出来，一位穿军装的女同志紧跟在后。这时，我把步子放慢，并不时回过头来凝望总理。我听见那位女同志向总理随行人员请示说，要不要广播？总理听见后马上转过头去打着手势说：不要广播。总理穿着一身宽松的浅灰色中山服，戴着一顶浅灰色干部帽，直向河滩走去。正在河滩流水边洗涮的同志都未发觉，当总理等通过木板桥走到对面河滩时，被一些同志发觉了，大家都站了起来，目送总理远去的身影。
    我在指挥部帮助工作的日子里，还看到许多文艺工作者前来工地参加劳动，体验生活。他们睡在帐篷里，吃在大食堂。大食堂的饭桌则是支起来的一块块木板，而凳子则是一些破砖块和木墩，大家就在这样的饭桌前就餐。他们满腔热情创作的反映水库生活的各类文艺作品，在工地演出展览，不计报酬。水库落成之夜，中央和北京市几十个文艺演出团体都来工地义务演出。我作为一个将要走向生活的高等艺术院校学生，置身于水库建设的火热生活之中，深感是一次很好的思想锻炼，又是一次很好的艺术实践。我在工地一面劳动和工作，一面抓紧时间画了一些水库建设的速写。回到学院后，创作了一幅题为《十三陵水库之夜》的套色木刻。后来，这幅木刻连同他人的一些反映水库建设的作品，入选一个国际版画展，先后在北京和莫斯科展出。
    如今，面对着山水如画般的水库风景区，我不禁陷入了沉思：水库建设中所表现出来的自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，领袖和干部同群众一起参加义务劳动的优良传统，知识分子和人民群众相结合的作风，在今天不是仍需提倡和发扬吗？
