The fourth plenary meeting of the 11th All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) was held today. Ding Guanggen, a member of the Political Bureau and a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech at the meeting on strengthening and improving the Party's leadership over trade union work.

Ding Guanggen said that the working class is the leading class of our country, representing advanced productive forces and production relations, being the fundamental driving force for construction and reform, and a powerful and concentrated social force for maintaining social stability and unity. All levels of Party committees must firmly establish the idea of relying wholeheartedly on the working class and the broad masses of the people, and genuinely strengthen and improve the Party's leadership over trade union work, fully playing the role of trade unions.

Ding Guanggen pointed out that trade unions are mass organizations of the working class under the leadership of the Party. Voluntarily accepting the Party's leadership is determined by the nature of trade unions in our country and is also a fine tradition of trade unions. Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in trade union work. All levels of Party organizations must, in accordance with the Party's line, principles, and policies, exercise unified leadership over trade unions at the same level, so that trade union organizations can play a better role. Trade union organizations must adhere to the correct political direction, maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee in politics, ideology, and action, and consciously uphold the Party's unified leadership and maintain social stability and unity. We must be vigilant and prevent any tendency to shake off or weaken the Party's leadership, and be vigilant and prevent some people with ulterior motives from disrupting stability and unity. It is absolutely not allowed for any organization to put forward political proposals that are opposed to the Party, and it is absolutely not allowed for there to be political organizations that oppose the four cardinal principles and endanger state power. Once discovered, they must be disbanded in accordance with the law.

Ding Guanggen said that the Communist Party has always been rooted in the masses, and the blood ties with the masses are the source of our Party's strength. We must fully carry out democracy and serve the people wholeheartedly. The Party exercises unified leadership over trade unions, but at the same time, it should also support trade unions, in accordance with the law and the trade union's charter, to execute the resolutions of higher-level trade union organizations, and to independently and creatively carry out work, fully performing the four social functions of "maintaining, building, participating, and educating." All levels of trade union organizations should closely connect with the masses of workers, go to the masses, listen to the voices of the masses, care about the hardships of the masses, protect the legitimate rights and interests of the masses, and strive to solve the difficulties of the masses; at the same time, they should guide workers in practical work to consciously achieve individual interests subordinated to national interests and local interests subordinated to overall interests.

Ding Guanggen said that trade unions should place ideological and political education in an important position, continuously improve the ideological and political awareness and scientific and cultural level of the masses of workers, and make trade unions into a great school for the broad masses of workers to learn communism in practice. We must carry out education among workers on adhering to the four cardinal principles, adhering to reform and opening up, and opposing bourgeois liberalization. We must make everyone truly understand that deviating from the four cardinal principles, the country has no hope, and the achievements of construction and reform that have been achieved will also be lost; the struggle against bourgeois liberalization and the struggle against the international reactionary forces that attempt to make our country undergo a peaceful evolution cannot be relaxed in the slightest. At present, we should focus on carrying out education on patriotism, socialism, independence, and self-reliance, and hard work, to enhance national self-esteem and strengthen the confidence to walk the socialist road.

Ding Guanggen proposed that all levels of trade unions should also carry out education on the fine traditions of the working class among workers; deeply carry out education on "four occupations" of occupational responsibility, occupational ethics, occupational discipline, and occupational skills, and strive to improve the quality of the workforce. In the current period of rectification and deepening reform, we should educate the broad masses of workers to understand and sympathize with the difficulties of the country, and strive to increase production and save, increase income and save, and continuously improve economic efficiency. Trade unions should become a democratic channel for workers to participate in politics in an organized, disciplined, and led manner, regularly reflecting the opinions and demands of workers to the Party and the government, and helping the Party and the government to improve their work.

Ding Guanggen finally said that we should unify our thoughts and actions with the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. The two most important tasks at present are: first, to maintain political stability and unity; second, to rectify and deepen reform through economic means, so that the economy of our country can move towards a track of sustained, stable, and coordinated development. These two tasks are both of great importance. He hoped that the broad masses of workers would be spirited, increase their confidence, always put the interests of the state first, and be determined to tighten their belts for a few years, work hard, unite as one, and complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party, the state, and the people with practical efforts. He firmly believed that trade union organizations and the broad masses of workers could become the backbone of social stability and the main force of rectification, deepening reform, and the modernization of Chinese socialism.

    丁关根在全总第十一届四次主席团会上提出
    加强和改善党对工会的领导
    必须警惕防止别有用心的人破坏安定团结
    新华社北京12月20日电　（记者朱幼棣）中华全国总工会十一届四次主席团会议今天召开。中共中央政治局候补委员、书记处书记丁关根在会上就加强和改善党对工会工作的领导发表了讲话。
    丁关根说，工人阶级是我们国家的领导阶级，是先进生产力和生产关系的代表，是建设和改革最基本的动力，是维护社会安定团结的强大而又集中的社会力量。各级党委必须牢固树立全心全意依靠工人阶级和广大人民群众的思想，切实加强和改善党对工会工作的领导，充分发挥工会的作用。
    丁关根指出，工会是党领导下的工人阶级的群众组织。自觉接受党的领导，是我国工会的性质所决定的，也是工会的优良传统。加强党的领导，是做好工会工作的根本保证。各级党组织都要按照党的路线、方针、政策，对同级工会实行统一领导，使工会组织更好地发挥作用。工会组织必须坚持正确的政治方向，同党中央在政治上、思想上、行动上保持高度一致，自觉维护党的统一领导，维护社会的安定团结。必须警惕和防止任何企图摆脱或削弱党的领导的倾向，警惕和防止某些别有用心的人破坏安定团结。绝不允许任何组织提出同党对立的政治主张，绝不允许存在反对四项基本原则、危害国家政权的政治组织，一经发现，必须依法取缔。
    丁关根说，共产党从来就是生根在群众之中的，与群众的血肉联系正是我们党的力量所在，要充分发扬民主，全心全意为人民服务。党对工会实行统一领导，同时也要支持工会依照法律和工会的章程，执行上级工会组织的决议，独立自主地、创造性地开展工作，充分履行“维护、建设、参与、教育”四项社会职能。各级工会组织应当密切同职工群众的联系，到群众中去，倾听群众的呼声，关心群众的疾苦，维护群众的合法权益，尽力解决群众的困难；同时，要在实际工作中引导职工自觉做到个人利益服从国家利益、局部利益服从整体利益。
    丁关根说，工会应当把思想政治教育放在重要位置上，不断提高职工群众的思想政治觉悟和科学文化水平，把工会办成广大职工在实践中学习共产主义的大学校。必须在职工中深入进行坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放、反对资产阶级自由化的教育。要让大家真正懂得，背离四项基本原则，国家没有希望，已经取得的建设和改革成果也会丧失；同资产阶级自由化的斗争，同国际反动势力妄图使我国和平演变的斗争，不能有丝毫放松。当前要突出抓好爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗的教育，增强民族自尊心，坚定走社会主义道路的信心。
    丁关根提出，各级工会还应当在职工中进行工人阶级优良传统的教育；深入开展职业责任、职业道德、职业纪律、职业技能的“四职”教育，大力提高职工队伍的素质。在目前治理整顿和深化改革时期，要教育广大职工理解和体谅国家的困难，努力增产节约、增收节支、不断提高经济效益。工会应当成为职工群众有组织、有纪律、有领导地参政议政的民主渠道，经常向党和政府反映职工群众的意见和要求，帮助党和政府改进工作。
    丁关根最后说，我们要用党的十三届五中全会的精神统一思想、统一行动。当前最重要的是抓好两件大事：一是要在政治上保持安定团结；二是要在经济上经过治理整顿、深化改革，使我国经济走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。这两件大事都至关重要。他希望广大职工振奋精神，增强信心，时时刻刻把国家利益放在第一位，下决心过几年紧日子，艰苦奋斗、团结一致，扎扎实实地完成党、国家和人民交给的光荣任务。他坚信工会组织和广大职工能成为稳定社会的中坚力量，成为治理整顿、深化改革和我国社会主义现代化建设的主力军。
    今天的会议还通过了即将召开的全总十一届二次执委会议的有关议程。倪志福同志在会上就起草工会工作报告向与会的全总主席团委员们作了说明。
