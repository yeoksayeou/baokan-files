    The Smallest Candle in the Desert
    By Han Xiaohui

    Prologue
    1986. Tokyo, Japan.
    A hyper-modern metropolis. History here has been condensed into a dense form. Everything, everything, seems to be running at high speed on a giant machine.
    But at this moment, in an art palace with a touch of antiquity, the giant hand of the historical clock suddenly stops:
    The 16th International Children's Art Exhibition, with its globally authoritative status, is underway. Blue-eyed, black-haired, white-haired, and yellow-eyed judges from various countries are voting. The staff holds their breath. Reporters gather. The grand prize announcement is imminent!
    Who doesn't understand that the most intense competition today is in education? Who doesn't see that whether it's the most developed economic power or the ambitious latecomers striving to catch up with the world, they are all frantically investing in education to vie for a strong position in the educational superpower rankings? It's not an exaggeration to say that any gold medal won by a child in the international arena is a golden milestone in that country's development history!
    But who would have thought that the sole special gold medal of this competition would be won by a Mongolian child from the Chinese grasslands of Keerqin?
    He was 15 years old that year. His name was Wang Lijun. He was a deaf-mute.
    His classmates, the deaf-mute siblings Li Xin and Li Li, also won bronze medals in the competition.
    The world's attention immediately focused on the Keerqin grasslands...

    Wind Chapter
    "Beyond the sky, the wind and sand greet you, where is China?"
    The Keerqin grasslands, a desolate place in the minds of people for thousands of years. In the past, exiled criminals were often sent there.
    The most terrifying thing is the grassland storms. They are demons that challenge human civilization, and in the desolate, weakest winter season, they howl and attack crazily every few days. Their power is gathered from the Ural Mountains, the West Siberian Plain, and the Baikal Lake area, and because of the endless desert's docile submission, they become ten times more ferocious. One year, they went mad and blew sand all the way to the Tiananmen Gate in Beijing, discovered by experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and immediately reported!
    This alarm was like a sharp dagger piercing the heart of an old lady in Beijing.
    The old lady was Wang Lijun's grandmother. The 5-year-old boy Liu Jingping was the precious child of a Beijing sent-down youth mother and a local sent-down youth father. That year, his parents took him back to Beijing to visit relatives. His grandfather saw him and liked him so much that he couldn't bear to let go. He often heard him sigh: "Ah, such a talented child, buried in the desert..."
    But coincidentally, on that Sunday evening, coincidentally, when other children from Beijing brought their grandchildren and nieces to visit the elderly, a letter from Keerqin arrived. The first sentence was to inform Liu Jingping that his painting "I Love Sunshine" had won a major award at the United Nations. The old man was stunned for a moment, and only after a long time did he loudly call over his grandchildren and great-grandchildren who were studying in key schools in the capital, telling them: "Don't think you are superior to Liu Jingping. You haven't done what he has done..."
    Although the words were like this, at night, the old man lay in bed, and his heart couldn't help but doubt over and over again: How could such a desolate and miserable sand pit fly out a golden phoenix?
    This mystery was also puzzling to officials and experts from the State Education Commission. Not to mention comparing it with the modernized schools of the United States, Britain, France, and Japan equipped with electronic sound, computers, libraries, laboratories, and painting halls, the mud-brick classrooms of Keerqin's elementary schools were also simple compared to schools in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The children's horizons were even more pitiful:
    "Have you seen mountains and seas?" "No."
    "Have you been to the zoo?" "No."
    "What do you like to draw?" "The sun. And cows and sheep."
    Poor children, born into ordinary herder or worker families, some of whom have been slaves for generations, due to natural, geographical, economic, cultural, political, social development, and other historical conditions, they only have so much of the world.
    But how they long to catch up. Their ancestors have dreamed of this for generations. Especially the deaf-mute children like Wang Lijun and Li Xin. But the desert demon fights them to the death, driving away one teacher after another, and trampling one colorful dream after another underfoot.
    The 1980s arrived, and humanity shone on the moon. News also came from Beijing that modern high-rise buildings were rising from the ground. The once docile desert also stirred. On another day when the storm sealed the door, the first batch of graduates from the Fine Arts Department of the Chifeng Normal University left the school and headed to their respective teaching posts in elementary schools. These young and enthusiastic art teachers were all from Keerqin and vowed to do something for their hometown. Before leaving, they drank their farewell wine in one gulp and made a pact: See you in three years! Let's test it with our students.
    So they worked hard—from getting up early in the morning to start a fire in the classroom, using old newspapers to block the cracks in the classroom, and then running far away to pick up the children, to teaching the children to draw the sun and cows and sheep—working day and night.
    Three years later, a gold medal from the United Nations hung on the chest of the Keerqin grasslands. Later, more and more gold, silver, and bronze medals from the autonomous region, other provinces, the country, foreign countries, and even international awards came, until they became countless flowers on the grasslands, almost blooming in every elementary school in Keerqin.
    The desert demon was defeated, weakened, and aged, and could no longer stop one batch of visitors after another from coming to inquire about the magical Keerqin.

    Soil Chapter
    A piece of land nurtures a piece of people. A piece of people also nurtures a piece of land.
    The beautiful Keerqin grasslands, this administrative region of nearly 60,000 square kilometers, is rich and fertile. The Xilamulun River is like a ribbon crossing the waist, flowing all the way to the Bohai Sea. Along the river, since the Neolithic Age, human civilization has been nurtured. After the Qin Dynasty, it became the stage for the activities of the ancestors of the Eastern Hu, Wuhuan, Xianbei, Khitan, Jurchen, Mongolian, and Han peoples. During the Liao Dynasty established by the Khitan people, it reached the highest peak of cultural and artistic development.
    Today, on this fertile land, the largest number of Mongols in the country reside—those who drove out the Japanese invaders, defeated the Kuomintang, and joyfully followed the Communist Party onto the broad road of socialism; those who are full of Eastern wisdom and have reached a high level of cultural cultivation. The descendants of the Mongols are intelligent and strong-willed, with extremely high comprehension. Generation after generation, the ancient ancestors left a rich cultural heritage for their descendants. Even today, in the children's prints, one can still see the childlike human and animal shapes and the vast grasslands, which sometimes resemble prehistoric cave paintings! Perhaps, when the children's tender hands grasp the carving knife, the wisdom and strength infused into them are not only the young teachers' words and deeds but also the cultivation and spirit of generations of artists?
    Since the dawn of civilization, humanity has faced an eternal puzzle: Living, for what?
    Western nations emphasize individuality for oneself. Eastern nations emphasize individuality for the whole. Parents of a generation are willing to dedicate themselves to their children. The eagles of Chifeng, generation after generation, aim to fly towards the world...
    People Chapter
    This noble fourth generation, although they are all ordinary teachers, should also be written into the heroic annals of the people. These names are: Ma Chengwu, Zhang Yan, Tumen Uligi, Liu Xiaodong, Tonglaga...
    Ma Chengwu: Thin and dark, not very tall, a bit disillusioned with the world.
    He is the teacher of Wang Lijun and his group of deaf-mute children and the founder of the Chifeng Children's Printmaking.
    The past is like smoke and clouds, but one class stands out in Ma Chengwu's memory: The classroom was quiet, and the students were drawing diligently. Suddenly, a child threw down his pen and started slapping his own face wildly. Deaf-mutes, because of their own defects, have a unique and sensitive understanding of the world. The child suspected the teacher of favoritism and used this method to "protest."
    This action was highly inflammatory and instantly turned a large group of children's eyes into ice shards!
    Ma Chengwu's heart ached, his legs softened, and he almost collapsed to the ground. He looked down at his clothes covered in dust; he looked up at the bare walls with straw sticking out—he was not afraid of hardship; he was willing to dedicate himself. But people are fragile, he was only in his twenties, he also needed emotional comfort!
    Zhang Yan: Round face with smiling eyes, obviously a teacher loved by the children. And he seemed to particularly like little children, his own daughter was only over two years old, small and beautiful. His 5-year-old male student Liu Jingping and 6-year-old female student Ma Hui had each brought back awards from the international competition.
    Teacher Zhang's class was truly wonderful:
    Children, sit down. Good, first listen to the musical fairy tale "The Tortoise and the Hare." Then draw a rabbit and a turtle on the blackboard. Then let the children think about how many scenes can represent this story? Finally, the children happily draw. The class was full of interest, like flowing clouds and water, but the effort after class was unknown, how many black hairs had been lost?
    Tumen Uligi: From his clothes and language, you can't tell if he is Mongolian or Han. Only when he skillfully speaks Mongolian with the students can you be sure he is a true Mongolian.
    Accumulate and then release, Teacher Tumen speaks first, and then comes a black joke: "In the school, I am the smallest candle. Look, Chinese, math, nature, geography, history, ethics, and then music, physical education, and art, art is at the very end. Even the children don't take us seriously. When I ask the students to do chores after class, they stare at me with big eyes, no one moves. When their homeroom teacher comes, hey, their actions are faster than monkeys."
    As for the initial establishment of the painting group, it was like a nest of bees exploding. Almost all the parents strongly opposed it.
    "Don't be anxious, painting can inspire children's intelligence."
    "That's not good. No, no, no."
    Tumen Teacher had to dare to defy the world, secretly teaching. Later, when the children achieved results, they went to Beijing, went abroad; coincidentally, the school also brought back the second place in the autonomous region's intelligence competition, half of the participating students were members of the art group, this time the nest exploded again: all the parents brought their children to join the art group...
    Liu Xiaodong: At first glance, he is still a big child. It is said that he is also a child at home, his parents are officials in the league, he has never worried about food and clothing since childhood, and his living and cultural conditions are superior.
    But at this moment, he is at a critical juncture in life: This smallest candle, should it continue?
    How, isn't it going well? Isn't it just being evaluated as an advanced teacher?
    "Yes. But... the salary of primary school teachers is too low, and their status is also too low..."
    Is the beautiful wife at home dragging him down?
    "Well, maybe. She was originally a math teacher at our school, two years ago she was transferred to an organization in the league, her salary and benefits suddenly increased by a large margin, and she was given a three-room apartment. It's a clear example, too stimulating! Thinking about it makes me complain that I should also quit."
    Then, do you miss your precious students?
    "Sigh, it's just this heartache that I can't let go. Otherwise, so many people who come to ask for advertising and signboards, all offer a good price, why hesitate? It's just that I can't bear it, the children have just been cultivated to nod, and I leave, isn't that misleading the children!"...
    There are 9,999 roads on the grasslands, and everyone chooses the one that suits them best. These young teachers who walk on solid ground also do not march in unison, each person treads his own path. But they have one thing in common, their works are all of high level and show great potential.
    I first saw them at the Chifeng Alliance Fine Arts Creation Seminar. Their works were displayed alongside those of professional or amateur painters. There were prints, comic strips, bookplates, and paper cuts. Ma Chengwu's comic strips have been published several times, Zhang Yan's prints have been included in the "Chifeng Alliance Excellent Works Collection," Tumen Uligi's prints have won the autonomous region's grand prize, Liu Xiaodong's bookplates have been exhibited in Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States...

    Emotion Chapter
    Just before Li Xin and Li Li, the siblings, won the international award, on a dark and windy night, their mother, an ordinary worker from the Shenyang Railway Bureau, was wandering on a cold, gleaming railway track.
    The wild wind from the desert tangled her hair. The endless darkness was lurking, ready to devour her at any moment. But she was oblivious to all this. Her eyes were full of tears, and her dignified face was twisted in pain—she was saying goodbye to the world!
    We people of the 1980s have little reason to condemn them. Twenty years ago, scientific knowledge was far from as widespread as it is today. She and her husband had a consanguineous marriage, resulting in Li Xin and Li Li both being deaf. This unbearable fruit almost destroyed the family's enthusiasm for life. After a series of unsuccessful medical treatments and the pain of being mocked by the world, the mother decided to sacrifice her love to make some amends—she went to die, so that her husband could find a good wife and have a healthy child!
    But the shadows of two children kept appearing before her eyes. People say that disabled people are especially intelligent, and this is especially true for Li Xin. This child has been highly intelligent since childhood. At the age of three, once his mother placed his small hand flat on the paper and traced it with a pen, he looked at the little hand on the paper and laughed happily, and from then on, he became obsessed with drawing.
    Colored pencils brought color to the children's lives. The affection for the children several times pulled the mother back from the jaws of death. When the news of the children's double award came, the whole Li Xin family cried their hearts out! After crying enough, the mother solemnly promised the family: From now on, she would never think of dying again...
    Wang Lijun's deafness was caused later in life. A rash at three months old, an overdose of injections, caused him to lose his hearing. As an adult, he also thought of death, once arguing with his mother: "It would have been better to die when I was young, better than being deaf and mute now!"
    Now, Wang Lijun has grown into a tall and strong young man. Even Ma Chengwu admires this student as a genius. Someone came to seek his calligraphy, asking if he wanted seal script, cursive script, or regular script? The most wonderful thing is that he plays chess extremely well, self-publishing four volumes of "Wang Lijun's Chess Manual," written neatly and hidden in his own bookcase.
    However, Wang Lijun is most obsessed with painting. His collection is 95% various sketches, copies, life drawings, and colors. He has decided to dedicate his life to the brush and carving knife. For a while, he applied to all art schools in the country, but none of them accepted him, plunging him into despair. Later, he finally overcame himself, applied to the Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Correspondence University, and is now studying diligently, seizing every second.
    The person Wang Lijun respects the most is Mr. Ma Chengwu, who led him into the world of prints. Another person moved by this young teacher is Wang Lijun's mother. She voluntarily requested to be transferred to the deaf-mute school to teach and is now spreading her love for a son to all deaf-mute children.
    Ah, a pearl illuminates a string of pearls. A green leaf calls forth a large green leaf. A red candle lights another red candle...
    Hope
    Although I have left Chifeng for many days, I still miss the Keerqin grasslands. From the bottom of my heart, I have also made myself half a grassland daughter. I often think: What can I do for those lovely little painters and their young teachers?
    At this moment, what jumps into my eyes is always that heartbreaking scene:
    In the cramped teacher's office, Teacher Zhang Yan is guiding one child after another to draw. Suddenly, a child jumped up as if burned, covering his thigh and hissing in pain. It's terrible, another child's cotton pants were burned by the stove fire. Teacher Zhang could only hit his own head with his fist, scolding himself for being careless. Just at this moment, the principal rushed in with a painting, saying, "Zhang Teacher, we can't afford to draw such paintings!"
    It was a piece of rice paper worth more than 50 cents, given to Zhang Yan by a friend. The principal mistook it for Zhang Yan using teaching funds to buy it and specially came to warn them...
    Every time I recall this, it makes my nose sting, and my mood becomes extremely oppressive.
    I really want to buy paper higher than the sky, let the children take it freely. Let them draw freely, draw as many as they want. Draw their sun, draw their cows and sheep, draw their respected young teachers.
    I really hope that one day, Chifeng will have no more winters. When the soft green grass quietly retreats with the autumn wind, what replaces it will no longer be rolling yellow sand, but a colorful carpet made of countless children's paintings, covering the entire Keerqin grasslands!

    大漠里最小的蜡烛
    韩小蕙
    引子
    1986年。日本东京。
    超豪华的现代化之都。历史在这里早已被浓缩了。一切的一切，都像搭上了一架开足马力的巨型机器，在高速度地运转着。
    唯此一刻，在一幢有点古色古香的艺术之宫里，历史之钟的巨针，突然停住不动了：
    有着世界权威地位的国际儿童画展已举行到第16届。金发碧眼的、黑发乌眸的、白发黄瞳的各国评委们正在投票。工作人员屏声敛息。记者云集。大赛评奖即将揭晓！
    有谁还不明白当今国际间最激烈的竞争就是教育的竞争？有谁还看不见无论是最发达的经济大国，还是雄心勃勃赶超世界的后起之秀，都在拚命地往教育上投金掷银以争得教育大国的有力地位？不夸张地说，如今能在国际间获得任何一枚儿童的金奖牌，都是在那个国家的发展史上树起的一座金色里程碑！
    可是，谁也没有想到，摘取这届大赛唯一一枚特别金奖的，竟是中国科尔沁草原上的一个蒙古族孩子。
    他那年15岁。他叫王力军。他是一个聋哑儿。
    与他同窗的一双聋哑兄妹李欣和李丽，同时获得了大赛铜奖。
    全世界的目光，立时都集中到科尔沁大草原上……
    风篇
    “天外边风迎面沙，举头何处是中华？”
    科尔沁草原，千百年来人们心目中的荒凉之地。过去，充军的犯人常往那里发配。
    最可怕的就是草原上的风暴。它是专与人类文明较量的恶魔，在荒凉的、人类最虚弱的冬季里，它三天两头就叫啸着来一次疯狂的攻击。它的火力，是从乌拉尔山、西西伯利亚平原和贝加尔湖一线就聚积起来了，因那毫无抵御能力的漫漫大漠的一味驯顺而变得凶猛十倍。有一年，它竟昏过了头，把沙尘一直吹到北京的天安门城楼上，被中科院的专家们发现并立即报警！
    这一声警报，像一把直插来的尖刀，把北京城里一位老太太捅得撕心裂腑。
    老太太是刘京平的姥姥。5岁小男孩刘京平，是当年来科尔沁草原插队的北京知青妈妈与当地知青爸爸相结合而出世的宝贝蛋儿。那一年，爸妈带他回北京探亲，姥爷一见就喜欢得舍不得撒手。常听见他叹惜：“唉，这么个天份高的孩子，被沙漠埋没了呀……”
    可是偏巧在那个星期日的晚上，偏巧在北京的其他儿女带着孙儿、外孙女来看二老之时，科尔沁来信了。劈头第一句话，就是告诉小京平的画《我爱阳光》在联合国得了大奖。老人一时愣住了，好一会儿，他才大声地把在首都各个重点学校上学的孙儿女们叫来，告诉他们说：别看你们老觉得比小京平优越，你们谁也没做到的事，他做到了……
    话虽是这样说，入夜，老人躺在床上，心里还禁不住在一遍一遍地疑惑：那么个荒凉凄苦的沙窝窝，怎么会飞出金凤凰的？
    这个奥秘，连国家教委的官员和专家们也弄不明白。别说与美英法日那些装备着电声、电脑、图书馆、实验室、绘画厅的现代化学校相比，科尔沁小学校的土砖房，比起北京、上海、广州的学校来，也简陋得有如小星望月。孩子们的视野更是小得可怜极了：
    “你们见过山和海吗？”“没有。”
    “你们去过动物园吗？”“没有。”
    “你们喜欢画什么？”“太阳。还有牛和羊。”
    可怜兮兮的孩子们呀，生于普通牧民、农工之家，有的世世代代都是奴隶，因自然、地理、经济、文化、政治地位、社会发展等等历史条件的限制，他们只拥有世界的这么多。
    可是他们多么想迎头赶上。他们的祖祖辈辈都梦想这样做。尤其是王力军、李欣这一群聋哑孩子们。但塞外的风魔却殊死力与他们拚斗，赶走了一位又一位支边的教师，把孩子们的五色梦一个又一个地踏碎在脚下。
    80年代了，人类辉煌地登上了月球。北京也传来了一幢幢现代化大楼拔地而起的信息。一味驯顺的大漠也躁动起来了。又一个风暴封门的日子里，哲里木盟师专绘画系的第一批毕业生们，离开学校，奔赴各自任教的小学校。这些意气风发的年轻美术教师们，全都是科尔沁的子弟，发誓要为家乡父老兄弟干一番事业。行前，他们将壮行酒一饮而尽，相约：3年后见！拿各自的学生们来检验。
    于是他们就发奋地干起来——从每天清晨摸黑赶到学校，劈柴搬煤生炉子，用破报纸一个一个地堵上教室的裂缝缝，再跑出老远去接孩子们，到教孩子们画太阳、画牛羊——没日没夜地干起来。
    三年以后，科尔沁大草原的胸膛上，便挂起联合国的这枚金奖章。再后来，自治区的、外省市的、国家的、外国的乃至国际的一枚枚金、银、铜质奖章越来越多，终至于成为草原上数不清的花朵，几乎开遍了科尔沁的每一所小学校。
    大漠上的风魔，败了，衰了，老朽了，再也阻不住一批批客人来问询神奇的科尔沁了。
    土篇
    一方土地养育一方人。一方人也养育一方土地。
    美丽的科尔沁草原这片近6万平方公里的“行政区划”富足丰饶，西拉木伦河尤如一条彩带拦腰而过，一直流向渤海之滨。大河上下，自新石器时代起，就开始孕育着人类文明。秦以后，这里成为东胡、乌桓、鲜卑、契丹、女真、蒙古和汉族先民们活动的舞台。至契丹人建立的辽王朝，达到文化艺术发展的最高峰。
    今天，在这片丰饶的土地上，聚居着全国最多的蒙族——就是赶走日寇、打败国民党，欢欣鼓舞地跟着共产党走上社会主义康庄大道的蒙族；就是充满着东方智慧和达到高度文化修养境界的蒙族。蒙族的世代子孙聪颖强悍，悟性极高。一代，又一代，远古祖先们给后人们留下了丰厚的民族文化积淀。至今在孩子们的版画里，还可看到，那充满稚气的人形、兽形和大草原，竟时不时地与史前壁画遗迹相仿佛！或许，当孩子们稚嫩的小手握起刻刀之时，注入给他们智慧和力量的，不光是年轻教师们的言传身教，还有世代艺术家们的修养和灵性？
    自有文明之日，人类就面临着一个永恒的困惑：活着，为了什么？
    西方民族讲究为一己的个性。东方民族强调个性为整体而发展。父母一辈甘心情愿奉献给自己的孩子。哲里木的世代雄鹰，目标如一地向世界奋飞……
    人篇
    这高尚的甘愿继往开来的第四代，虽然都是普通教师，但也应该写入人民群众的英雄谱。这些名字是：马成武、张延、图门乌力吉、刘晓东、通拉嘎……
    马成武：黑黑瘦瘦，个儿不高，有点愤世嫉俗。
    他就是王力军一群聋哑儿的恩师，也是哲盟儿童版画的创始人。
    往事均淡如烟云，唯有那一堂课，令马成武终生难忘：课堂里本来静悄悄的，学生们正在安心作画。一个孩子突然把笔一摔，疯了似的“啪！啪！”地抽起自己的嘴巴。聋哑人因其自身的缺陷，对世界的领悟是格外独特和敏感的。孩子猜忌老师偏心，便用此方式“示威”。
    而这一举动，竟还具有极大的煽动性，顿使一大片孩子的眼里结起冰碴儿！
    马成武心里一阵酸楚，腿一软差点瘫坐在地上。低下头，他看着自己满身灰土的衣裳；抬起头，他望着裸露着秫秸的破土墙——吃苦，他不怕；奉献，也舍得。可是人毕竟是脆弱的，他还只有20多岁，他也需要感情的慰藉！
    张延：圆脸上长着一双笑眯眯的眼睛，一看便知是小孩子们喜欢的老师。而他好像也特别喜欢小小孩儿，他自己的女儿才2岁多，娇小漂亮得不行。他5岁的男学生刘京平和6岁的女弟子马慧，曾分别捧回了国际大赛奖。
    张老师的课上得真是绝妙极了：
    小朋友们坐好。好，先请听配乐童话故事《龟兔赛跑》。然后在黑板上画上一只兔子和一只乌龟。再让孩子们想想，用几个画面能把这故事表现出来？最后，是孩子们高高兴兴地作画。课上得极有情趣宛若行云流水，课下的功夫却不知熬掉了几多黑发？
    图门乌力吉：从服装和语言上，你根本看不出他是蒙还是汉？只有当他熟练地操着蒙语和学生对话时，才能确信他是真正的蒙族。
    厚积而薄发，图门老师一开口，先来了段黑色幽默：“在学校里，我算是最小的蜡烛。这不，语文、算术、自然、地理、历史、品德，而音、体、美，美术是排在最末一位的。连孩子们也不拿我们当回事。下课时我吩咐学生们做值日，他们小眼瞪大眼看着我，谁也不动手。等他们班主任老师来了，嗨，那个动作都比小猴子还快。”
    至于当初绘画小组成立，那就跟炸了窝似的，家长们差不多全都强烈反对。
    “您先别急，绘画能够启发孩子们的智力。”
    “那也不成。不成，不成，不成。”
    弄得图门老师只好冒天下之大不韪，偷着教。后来孩子们画出成绩来了，上了北京了，去了外国了；可巧学校又拿回全自治区智力竞赛第二名，其中有一半参赛学生都是美术小组的成员，这下又炸了一次窝：家长们全都带着孩子投奔美术小组来了……
    刘晓东：一眼看去，他简直还是个大孩子。据说他在家里也就是个孩子，父母都是盟里的干部，自小吃穿不用愁，生活和文化条件都优越。
    可是这个当儿，他却处在一个严峻的人生十字路口：这根最小的蜡烛，还要不要干下去？
    怎么，不是干得挺好吗？不是刚刚被评为先进教师吗？
    “是呀。可是……咱小学教师的工资太低，地位也太低……”
    家有娇妻，是不是拖了后腿了？
    “就算是吧。她原来也是咱学校的数学教师，前二年调到盟里一个机关，工资、福利一下子都比咱高出一大截，还给了三间一套的房子。明摆着的例子，太刺激人了！想起来就叨咕我也别干了呗。”
    那，你舍得你那些宝贝学生？
    “咳，就这点心事放不下。要不，那么多找咱画广告画招牌的，都出不小的价钱，还犹豫个啥？咱是于心不忍，孩子们刚刚培养出点头，咱撂下就走了，不是误人子弟吗！”……
    草原上的路有九千九百九十九条，每个人都选择了最适合自己的一条。这些脚踏实地的年轻教师们，也都并不整齐划一，各人跋涉着自己的路。不过，他们有一点很相同，他们的作品全都水平很高并显示着很大的潜力。
    我最初见到他们时，是在全盟美术创作研讨会上。他们的作品与其他专业或业余画家们的摆在一起，有版画、连环画、藏书票，还有剪纸等。马成武的连环画已出版过好几本，张延的版画被收入《哲盟画家优秀作品集》，图门乌力吉的版画获得过自治区大奖，刘晓东的藏书票被送展日本、香港、美国……
    情篇
    就在李欣、李丽兄妹俩获得国际大奖的前不久，一个月黑风高的夜晚，他们的母亲，沈阳铁路分局的一位普通干部，在一条闪着寒光的铁道上徘徊。
    从大漠来的狂风撕乱了她的头发。无边的黑暗觊觎着，随时准备将她吞噬。而她自己对这一切已浑然不觉。她满眼是泪，端庄的脸已被痛苦扭曲得变了型——她正在向这个世界告别！
    我们八十年代的人没有多少理由谴责他们，20年前，科学知识远没有今天这般普及，她和她的丈夫近亲结婚，结果生下的李欣、李丽全都听力失聪。这难以接受的苦果，几乎摧毁了这个家庭对生活的全部热情。在经过一连串求医不得的打击和世人冷嘲热讽的痛苦之后，母亲决定奉献出自己的爱，来作些许挽救——她去赴死，以便让丈夫再去找一个好妻子，生一个健全的孩子！
    可是一双儿女的身影老在她的眼前晃动。人都说，残疾人特别聪明，此话尤其在李欣身上得到了印证。这孩子自小悟性极高，3岁时候，有一次妈妈把他的小手平放在纸上，用笔勾勒出来，他望着纸上的小手高兴得直笑，从此就迷上了画画。
    彩色的画笔给儿女的生活带来了彩色的希望。对儿女的眷恋几次把母亲从死神的利爪下拖回。当儿女双双获奖的喜讯传来之时，李欣全家人抱头痛哭！哭够了，母亲郑重地答应全家：从此再不去想死了……
    王力军的聋哑却是后天造成的。小生命3个月时的一场湿疹，注射了过多的药针，竟使他失去了听力。成年以后，他也想到了死，有一回跟妈妈发脾气：“小时候死了多好，也比现在聋哑强！”
    如今，王力军已长成白杨树般的一个青年。连马成武都叹服这个学生是才子。有人慕名来求他的字，他问人家想要隶书、草书还是楷书？最精彩的是他的象棋下得极好，自著4本《王力军棋谱》，写得工工整整藏在自己的书柜里。
    不过，王力军最痴迷的还是丹青。他的藏书，95％以上全是各种素描、临摹、写生、色彩之类。他已暗下决心，要把终生托付给画笔和刻刀。一度，遍考全国美术院校，没有一座学校肯录取他，使他陷入绝望之中。后来，他终于战胜自我，报考了中国书画函授大学，现在正在点点滴滴，争分夺秒地苦读。
    王力军平生最尊重的人，就是把他领到版画世界之中的马成武先生。被这位年轻教师感动的还有一个人，就是王力军的妈妈。她主动要求调到聋哑学校任教，如今，正把对一个儿子的爱心洒向全体聋哑儿女。
    呵，一颗珍珠照亮了一大串珍珠。一片绿叶唤来了一大片绿叶。一支红烛点燃了另一些红烛……
    希望
    尽管我已离开哲里木多日了，至今却还在思念着科尔沁大草原。从内心里，我已把自己也划作半个草原女儿。我常想：自己该为那些可爱的小画家，还有他们年轻的教师们，做点什么？
    这时候，跳到我眼帘之前的，却总是那令人心碎的一幕：
    狭小局促的教师办公室里，张延老师正在辅导一个挤着一个的孩子们作画。突然间，一个孩子被烫了似的窜起来，捂着大腿“咝咝”地直跳脚。真是糟糕，又一个孩子的棉裤被炉火烤糊了，张老师只好又用拳头擂着自己的脑袋骂自己粗心大意。正在这时，校长拎着一张画风风火火地跑进门来，劈头就说：“张老师，这样的画咱可画不起啊！”
    那是一张价值5角多钱的宣纸，是朋友送给张延的。校长误以为是张延动用教学经费买的，特意来警告他们……
    每忆及此，都让我鼻子发酸，心情立即变得无比压抑。
    真有心买下比天还高的画纸，任孩子们随意地来取。让他们自由自在地画，想画多少张就画上多少张。画出他们的太阳，画出他们的牛羊，画出他们可敬的年轻教师们。
    我真希望有一天，哲里木再也没有了冬天。当茸茸绿草随秋风悄然遁去之后，代替它们的，再不是滚滚滔滔的黄沙，而是由千千万万张孩子们的图画铺成的五彩地毯，铺满在整个科尔沁大草原！
