The first national conference on foreign trade legal work began today in Beijing. Wang Pinqing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said that learning to use legal means to manage and develop foreign trade, rather than relying solely on administrative measures, is a necessity for further reform and opening up, as well as for implementing the rectification and adjustment policy.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, China has successively promulgated a series of laws, regulations, and corresponding rules and systems for foreign economic and trade activities, including the "Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures," "Law on Economic Contracts Involving Foreign Interests," "Customs Law," "Inspection Law," "Patent Law," "Trademark Law," and "Provisional Regulations on Foreign Exchange Control." The country has also acceded to and joined numerous international treaties and signed bilateral economic and trade agreements with more than 100 countries, fundamentally changing the situation where foreign economic and trade activities in China lacked legal basis. Currently, from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade to some provincial and municipal economic and trade commissions, legal and treaty institutions have been established. Some specialized import and export corporations and industrial and commercial companies have set up legal departments, and many companies have hired legal advisors to promptly handle foreign trade contract disputes, thus saving the companies and the state from significant economic losses. A professional team for foreign trade legal work has initially taken shape.

Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, and Gu Ming, Vice Chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the conference. Ren Jianxin called for further and rapid development of legislation and law enforcement in foreign economic and trade activities, bringing foreign economic and trade work under legal regulation. He emphasized the need to sign contracts in accordance with the law, perform contracts in accordance with the law, and resolve contract disputes in accordance with the law. Gu Ming stressed the need to accelerate foreign trade legislation and promptly amend existing laws and regulations that are no longer applicable, raising foreign trade work to a modern and legalized level.

Attendees at this conference also included officials from the Customs, banking, arbitration, insurance, State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and State Bureau of Commodity Inspection.

    外贸正纳入法制轨道
    首次全国外贸法律工作会议开幕
    本报北京12月9日讯　记者计泓赓报道：新中国外贸史上第一次全国外贸法律工作会议今天起在北京举行。经贸部副部长王品清说，学会运用法律手段管理对外贸易，发展对外贸易，而不仅仅依靠行政手段，是进一步改革开放和贯彻治理整顿方针的需要。
    改革开放10年，我国先后颁布了《中外合资经营企业法》、《涉外经济合同法》、《海关法》、《商检法》、《专利法》、《商标法》、《外汇管理暂行条例》等一系列对外经贸的法律、法规和相应的规章制度，缔结和加入了许多国际条约，同世界上100多个国家签订了双边经济贸易协定，从根本上改变了我国对外经贸活动无法可依的状况。目前从经贸部到一些省市的经贸委，均已设立了条约法律机构；有些专业进出口总公司和工贸公司，设立了法律部，不少公司还聘请了法律顾问，及时处理外贸合同争议，为公司、国家挽回了不少经济损失；一支对外贸易法律工作专业队伍已初步形成。
    最高人民法院院长任建新、人大法律委员会副主任顾明出席了会议。任建新要求进一步迅速开展对外经贸的立法与执法工作，把对外经贸工作纳入法制轨道，要依法签订合同，依法履行合同，依法解决合同纠纷。顾明强调要加快外贸立法，及时修改不适应的现行法律、法规，把外贸工作提高到现代化、法制化的水平。
    出席这次会议的还有海关、银行、仲裁、保险、国家工商局、国家商检局等部门的负责人。
