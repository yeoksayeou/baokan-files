The economic growth rate of the Asia-Pacific region in 1989, although not as high as in 1988, saw only a slight decrease and continued to maintain a leading growth position higher than other regions. The region's economic growth rate for 1989 was approximately 6.5%, about one percentage point lower than in 1988. In contrast, the economic growth rates of the European Community, Latin America, the Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa were only about half or one-third of that in the Asia-Pacific region. Of course, the economic situations within the Asia-Pacific region vary among different countries (regions).

While the Asia-Pacific region's economy continued to grow at a relatively high speed, its foreign trade expanded, overseas investments were unusually active, and foreign exchange reserves increased. The region maintained a certain development momentum in international finance, aviation, shipbuilding, and overseas construction contracting. The Asia-Pacific region is becoming an important driving force in the development of the world economy and trade.

The economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in 1989 had several notable features. First, there was an unprecedented phenomenon in economic development: the "north high, south low" economic growth pattern was replaced by a "south high, north low" situation. Countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which had previously experienced slower economic growth compared to South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, saw a rapid increase in their development speeds, approaching or even surpassing the latter's levels. This reversal was primarily due to the currency appreciation, labor disputes, wage increases, and rising production costs in the latter, leading to a sluggish manufacturing sector and slower export growth. In contrast, the former experienced the opposite situation. It appears that this shift is not a temporary phenomenon. Second, there was an increase in imports. The most notable example was Japan, followed by the "Four Little Dragons," and then countries like Thailand and Malaysia in ASEAN. In October, Japan's imports grew by 16.3% compared to the same period last year, while exports decreased by 1.9%, marking the first decline in export value since June 1985. It is estimated that the full-year import value will exceed $200 billion, with an approximate 10% increase. It is estimated that South Korea's full-year imports will reach $64 billion, a 24% increase. From January to August, Hong Kong and Singapore's imports grew by 20.6% and 14.3%, respectively. Australia's imports for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1989, grew by 17% compared to the previous year, while exports increased by only 6%. Some predict that over the next five years, the Asia-Pacific region's import trade will exceed export trade. Strong domestic consumption demand, active investment, market opening under external pressure, the resale of goods from overseas subsidiaries, the rebound in oil and other primary product prices, and currency appreciation are all important reasons for the increase in imports. The U.S. saw a 15% increase in exports in the first nine months of the year, largely due to the increased imports from the Asia-Pacific region. Third, two-way or multi-way investments were unprecedentedly active. Japan and the United States, two traditional capital-exporting countries, continued to expand their overseas investments. From 1988 to 1989, direct foreign investment in the United States reached $57.1 billion, with Japanese direct investment in the U.S. increasing by 51% compared to the previous year. In 1988, foreign investment in Japan increased from $2.21 billion to $3.24 billion, and it is estimated to reach over $4 billion this year, with U.S. capital accounting for the largest share. ASEAN is one of the key regions for foreign investment. Reports indicate that in the first five months of the year, foreign investment applications in Thailand reached $3.846 billion, with Japanese and South Korean investments in Indonesia also growing exponentially. The U.S. also plans to invest $575 million in Malaysia over the next five years to build a large-scale semiconductor plant. The investment boom in the Asia-Pacific region since 1985 is driving changes in the region's production and industrial landscape, while also significantly impacting the formation of new divisions within industries and departments, as well as regional economic integration.

Despite the vibrant continued growth of the Asia-Pacific region's economy, its prospects are not entirely smooth, and there are still many pressing issues to address. Inflation, debt burdens, currency appreciation, wage increases, insufficient job opportunities, unequal national income distribution, industrial structure imbalances and upgrading obstacles, deepening dependence on external funds and technology, and the prevalence of trade protectionism, along with pressures to open markets including intellectual property, finance, construction, and agriculture, as well as the trend towards economic regionalization, all present a series of unfavorable factors hindering economic development. Some of these factors have already become quite prominent. For example, inflation: in 1989, the price increase indices for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore reached their highest levels in nearly six or seven years, while the Philippines exceeded double digits, and South Korea and Thailand also surpassed their original targets.

Given the above situation, it is difficult to expect the Asia-Pacific region's economy to achieve the high-speed growth seen in 1988 in 1990, but it will not be low-speed growth either. Generally, the economic growth rate for the Asia-Pacific region in the coming year is expected to be slightly lower than the 1989 level. First, according to experts' predictions, the U.S. economy will grow by at least 2% in 1990. Japan's economy, driven by consumption and investment, will continue to show a growth trend, achieving an approximate growth rate of over 4%. Second, although the "Four Little Dragons" face new challenges and their economic growth speeds have slowed, they still have a certain adaptability. Third, after more than a decade of hard work, the ASEAN economy has begun to enter a growth-oriented development track.

In addition, there are several factors favorable to economic development. First, due to the long-term accumulation of surplus funds in the region and the relatively limited domestic investment opportunities, to counter economic regionalization and trade protectionism, and to avoid trade and non-trade barriers, direct investment overseas in the Asia-Pacific region will continue to increase. Second, the Asia-Pacific region is universally undergoing industrial structure adjustments. Japan's economic adjustment, characterized by large-scale overseas transfer of production bases and expanded imports of manufactured goods, the "Four Little Dragons'" industrial adjustment, characterized by diversified export markets, and ASEAN's economic adjustment, centered on attracting foreign investment and expanding export capabilities, actively developing textile apparel, electronics, automotive, and other processing and assembly industries, and the deep processing of primary products, all these can promote trade multilateralization and the continuous expansion of intra-regional trade, as well as enhance the international competitiveness of products. Third, military confrontation is gradually turning into political dialogue, arms races are giving way to comprehensive national strength competitions, and especially the significant strengthening of the economic role in national relations, all these provide favorable conditions and environments for the region's economic development.

    亚太地区经济发展继续强劲
    韩镇涉
    一九八九年亚太地区的经济增长速度虽不及一九八八年，但减幅不大，继续保持了高于其他地区的领先增长地位。该地区一九八九年的经济增长率平均约为百分之六点五，比一九八八年大约下降一个百分点，而欧洲共同体、拉美、西亚和撒哈拉以南地区的经济增长率只及亚太地区的二分之一或三分之一。当然，亚太地区内部各国（地区）的经济形势也不尽相同。
    亚太地区在经济继续以较高速度增长的同时，对外贸易还在扩大，海外投资异常活跃，外汇存底有增无减，在国际金融、航空运输、船舶承建、海外建筑承包等领域都保持了一定的发展势头。该地区正在成为世界经济贸易发展的重要推动力量。
    一九八九年亚太地区经济发展有几个特点：一是出现了经济发展中未曾有过的新现象，即“北高南低”的经济增长由“南高北低”的局面所代替。泰国、马来西亚和印度尼西亚等国的经济增长过去一直低于南朝鲜、台湾、香港等地区，今年前者的发展速度不仅出现了迅速上升的势头，而且接近或超过后者的水平。这种逆转的出现主要因素是后者的货币升值、劳资纠纷、工资上涨和产品成本提高，引起制造业不振和出口增长减缓，而前者情况则相反。看来这种转折不是一时现象。二是进口增加。其中最明显的是日本，其次是“四小”，还有泰国、马来西亚等东盟国家。日本十月份进口比去年同期增长百分之十六点三，出口下降百分之一点九，这是自一九八五年六月以来出现的第一次出口额下降。预计全年进口额将超过两千亿美元，约增长百分之十。预计南朝鲜全年进口将达六百四十亿美元，增长百分之二十四。一至八月，香港和新加坡进口分别增长百分之二十点六和百分之十四点三。澳大利亚到今年六月三十日结束的上一财政年度比前一年度进口增长百分之十七，出口只增加百分之六。有人预测今后五年亚太地区进口贸易将超过出口贸易。强劲的国内消费需求和活跃的投资热、外部压力下的市场开放、在外的本国子公司商品的反销、石油及其他初级产品价格的回升以及本币升值等都是进口增加的重要原因。美国今年头九个月出口增长百分之十五，就和亚太地区增加进口有很大关系。三是双向或多向投资空前活跃。日本和美国这两个传统的资本输出国继续扩大对外投资。一九八八至一九八九年度外国在美国的直接投资达五百七十一亿美元，其中日本对美的直接投资比上一年度增长百分之五十一。一九八八年外国在日本的投资由上一年的二十二点一亿美元增加到三十二点四亿美元，预计今年将达四十多亿美元，其中占第一位的是美国资本。东盟是外国投资的重点地区之一。据报道，今年头五个月外国对泰国投资申请额达三十八点四六亿美元，日本和南朝鲜对印尼的投资也在成倍地增长。美国也计划在今后五年内向马来西亚投资五点七五亿美元建设大型半导体厂。亚太地区自一九八五年以后出现的投资热潮正在推动着本地区生产和产业面貌的改变，同时还对工业内部和部门内部新的分工格局的形成以及区域经济一体化产生重大影响。
    亚太地区经济尽管实现了有活力的继续增长，但其前景并非一帆风顺，亟待解决的问题还不少。通货膨胀、债务负担、货币升值、工资上涨、就业机会不足、国民所得分配不公、产业结构不协调和升级受阻、资金技术引进和对外依赖加深，还有贸易保护主义盛行，对包括知识产权、金融、建筑、农业在内的市场开放的压力以及世界经济区域集团化趋势等一系列阻碍经济发展的不利因素都存在，其中有些因素已经较为突出。例如通货膨胀，一九八九年台湾、香港和新加坡物价上涨指数已创近六七年的最高水平，菲律宾突破了二位数，南朝鲜和泰国也都超过了原定的目标。
    鉴于上述情况，一九九○年亚太地区的经济很难指望出现像一九八八年那样的高速增长，但也不会是低速增长，一般来说，明年亚太地区经济增长率预计将略低于一九八九年水平。首先，据专家们的预测，美国经济一九九○年至少要达到百分之二。日本经济在消费带动投资、投资促进内需的双刺激下会继续呈现出增长的势头，大体能实现百分之四以上的增长。其次，“四小”经济尽管面临新的挑战，经济增长速度放慢，但它们都还有一定的适应能力。第三，东盟经济经过十多年的艰苦努力开始步入成长型发展轨道。
    除此之外，还有几点有利于发展经济的因素。一，由于本地区剩余资金的多年积累和国内投资机会的相对有限，为了对付经济区域集团化和贸易保护主义，避开贸易和非贸易壁垒，亚太地区对海外的直接投资将会继续增加；二，亚太地区正在普遍进行产业结构调整。以大规模向海外转移生产基地和扩大制成品进口为主要内容的日本的经济调整，以出口市场多样化为特点的“四小”的产业调整，以吸引外资、扩大出口能力为中心积极发展纺织成衣、电子、汽车等加工装配工业和初级产品的再加工深加工的东盟的经济调整，这些都能促进贸易多边化和区内贸易的不断扩大以及提高产品的国际竞争力；三，军事对抗逐渐转为政治对话，军备竞赛让位于综合国力竞赛，特别是国家关系中经济作用的显著加强，这些都为本地区发展经济提供有利的条件和环境。
