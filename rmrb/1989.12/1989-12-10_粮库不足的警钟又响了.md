The alarm of insufficient grain storage rings again. This year, the grain harvest was bountiful, and the increase in production was not significant. However, at a recent national grain work conference, grain bureau directors from various regions reported that grain storage is in crisis, with some places even refusing to accept grain due to insufficient storage capacity.

Beijing: By the end of September, the stored grain exceeded the storage capacity by over 100 million kilograms. More than 80 sites in the suburbs, Baoding, and Dingxian in Hebei Province have been rented to store grain outdoors. Currently, more than 200 train cars of grain cannot be unloaded due to lack of storage space, and the import of wheat into Beijing has been temporarily suspended.

Hubei: Over 140 million kilograms of commercial grain are currently stored outdoors. In the coming period, an additional 200 million kilograms of commercial grain are planned to be stored outdoors. Some places have poor outdoor storage facilities, and grain spoilage and souring have already been discovered.

Shanghai: Outdoor grain piles are built in the middle of warehouse-style warehouses, occupying fire truck lanes. If an accident occurs, the consequences will be dire.

Jilin: This year, about 70 to 80 billion kilograms of commercial grain can be collected, but the storage capacity is only 35 billion kilograms, lacking about half.

According to Li Yinxin, Director of the Grain Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce, and his deputy, Zhang Guowei, the country currently has grain storage facilities with a total capacity of 142.7 billion kilograms. Nearly half of these were built before liberation or in the 1950s and 1960s and are nearing the end of their useful life. Additionally, the distribution of storage facilities between provinces and regions is imbalanced, and the contradictions are becoming more pronounced.

In 1984, after a bumper grain harvest, there was a "difficulty in selling grain," with insufficient grain storage being one of the lessons learned. The following year, the state invested 1.4 billion yuan and mobilized local construction funds totaling 1.6 billion yuan to build a batch of grain storage facilities.

However, since 1987, the issue of grain storage shortages seems to have been forgotten. In recent years, the state has not invested in this area, and local governments have diverted part of the annual depreciation fees, major repair funds, and simple construction funds totaling over 200 million yuan for other uses. The Ministry of Commerce proposed a plan to build 100 billion kilograms of national reserve grain storage facilities two years ago, but the funds have not yet been secured. Meanwhile, due to the age of the facilities, tens of billions of kilograms of storage capacity are becoming unusable each year.

Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin proposed achieving a new breakthrough in agricultural development in the near future. Now, the entire Party and the nation are taking action. It is believed that the time to achieve a new level in grain production will not be long. The grain storage issue is urgent. Therefore, grain bureau directors and relevant experts suggest that grain storage construction be included in the agenda of central and local governments as soon as possible, with funds contributed by the central government, local governments, and departments, and used for their designated purposes. Starting from next year, in addition, it is suggested that local financial departments concentrate simple construction funds to truly use them for warehouse maintenance and construction, and to prevent the recurrence of the "difficulty in selling grain" and "difficulty in storing grain" lessons from 1984.

### 粮库不足的警钟又响了

    粮库不足的警钟又响了
    新华社记者　陈芸
    今年粮食丰收了，按预计增产的幅度不算大，可是在日前召开的全国粮食工作会议上，各地的粮食局长们纷纷报告：粮库告急，有的地方甚至出现了因粮库不足，拒收粮食的现象。
    北京——9月底的库存粮食超过库容10亿多公斤，已在郊区、河北保定、定县等地租用80多处场地，露天存放。目前每天有200多节车皮的粮食因没地方存放，无法卸车，日前被迫暂停接卸进口小麦进京。
    湖北——14亿多公斤贸易粮现存放露天，今后一段还计划收20亿公斤贸易粮，也得放在露天，有的地方露天堆设施太简陋，已发现有粮食发霉、变酸情况。
    上海——露天粮食堆建在了房式仓库中间，挤占了消防车通道，一旦发生意外，后果不堪设想。
    吉林——今年可收七八十亿公斤贸易粮，而仓容只有35亿公斤，缺少一半左右。
    据商业部粮食储运局局长李荫林、副局长常国威介绍，全国现有容积1427亿公斤的粮仓，其中将近一半是解放前或五六十年代建的，基本都到了报废期。又由于仓库省间、地区间分布不平衡，矛盾日益突出起来。
    记得1984年粮食大丰收后，出现了“卖粮难”，这其中粮库不足是教训之一。为此，第二年国家投资14亿元，又集中了各地的简易建筑费16亿元，建了一批粮库。
    但是1987年以后，粮库短缺的问题似乎又被人们淡忘了。这两年，国家不但没有投资，各地每年提取的20多亿元折旧费、大修理基金和简易建筑费。其中一部分也被挪作他用了。商业部前年提出一个建设100亿公斤国家储备粮库的规划，两年中他们向上打了数不清的报告，可至今资金还未落实。而根据建设年代，每年又有几十亿公斤的仓容报废。
    最近，江泽民总书记提出，要在近期内实现农业发展的新突破。现在，全党全国上下都行动起来了，相信粮食上一个新台阶的时间为期不会长久，粮库问题已迫在眉睫。因此，各地粮食局长和有关专家建议：尽快把粮库建设纳入中央和地方政府的议事日程，资金由中央、地方、部门各挤一点，专款专用，从明年起步。此外，建议各级财政把简易建筑费集中起来，真正用于仓库维修和建设，再不能让1984年“卖粮难”“储粮难”的教训重演了。
