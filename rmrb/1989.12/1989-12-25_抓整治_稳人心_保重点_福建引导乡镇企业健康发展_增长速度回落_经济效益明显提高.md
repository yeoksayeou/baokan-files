    Cracking Down on Irregularities, Stabilizing Minds, and Protecting Key Areas: Fujian Guides Township Enterprises to Healthy Development
    Growth Rate Slows, Economic Benefits Significantly Improved

    BEIJING — Reporters He Jiazheng and Peng Jialing report: The various levels of Party committees and governments in Fujian Province have been simultaneously focusing on rectification and stabilization, guiding the province's township enterprises to steady and healthy development after experiencing abnormal high-speed growth and subsequent fluctuations and shocks in the early part of the year.

    Throughout this year, Fujian Province has consistently adhered to the policy of addressing two fronts regarding township enterprises. While correctly understanding and actively implementing the central government's rectification and stabilization policies, the province has also addressed issues such as confusion and hesitation among the workforce, as well as practical difficulties. Efforts have been made to stabilize policies, minds, and production. Currently, the development speed of Fujian's township enterprises has significantly slowed. The total fixed asset investment of township enterprises in the province has been reduced by 40% compared to last year. From January to September, the total output value growth rate of township enterprises decreased by 28 percentage points compared to the same period last year, with the industrial output value growth rate dropping by nearly 31 percentage points. Meanwhile, economic benefits have improved, with realized profits and taxes increasing by about 25% compared to the same period last year. The development momentum of export-oriented enterprises is strong. This year, various localities have signed over 500 contracts to attract foreign investment, surpassing the total foreign investment attracted in previous years.

    In the second half of the year, Fujian's township enterprises experienced significant fluctuations due to various factors. The provincial Party committee, government, and various leadership bodies believe that township enterprises must be rectified and stabilized. Without stabilizing township enterprises, it is difficult to stabilize the rural economy, especially as export-oriented foreign exchange-earning enterprises are crucial for Fujian. To stabilize township enterprises, it is first necessary to stabilize policies and minds. Therefore, they have actively promoted and explained the central government's policies. Leaders of the provincial Party committee and government have repeatedly discussed township enterprise issues at meetings, guiding cadres and the masses at all levels to correctly understand the relationship between rectification and deepening reforms, and between rectification and stable development, thereby dispelling doubts and enhancing the self-awareness of cadres at all levels to participate in rectification. At the same time, based on the province's actual situation, they have formulated and clarified some policy boundaries. For example, due to historical reasons and special conditions, Fujian Province has a relatively large number of shareholding township enterprises. Some people were once concerned and hesitant, not daring to develop production. The relevant provincial departments, based on investigations and research, affirmed the form of laborers jointly establishing cooperative enterprises, proposing that enterprises that are voluntarily united, jointly operated, collectively labored, democratically managed, and implement distribution according to labor and dividend distribution of share capital, and allocate a certain proportion of post-tax profits as public accumulation, continue to be treated as "collective economy" according to the province's 1987 relevant documents, enjoying the treatment of collective enterprises. In addition, policies for supply and marketing personnel have also been formulated. Due to stable policies and minds, production has also been further stabilized and developed. Currently, foreign investors and many Taiwanese businessmen are flocking here, either signing contracts or expressing intentions or conducting inspections. The foreign investors and Taiwanese businessmen seen by the reporter all expressed confidence in the future. Export-oriented township enterprises will further develop in Fujian.

    抓整治　稳人心　保重点
    福建引导乡镇企业健康发展
    增长速度回落　经济效益明显提高
    本报讯　记者何加正、彭嘉陵报道：福建省各级党委和政府一手抓治理整顿，一手抓稳定发展，使全省乡镇企业在经历了年初不正常高速发展和后期的波动、震荡以后，逐步走上稳定健康发展的轨道。
    今年以来，福建省对乡镇企业始终坚持了两手抓的方针。在正确理解、积极贯彻中央治理整顿方针的同时，针对乡镇企业中出现的思想混乱、观望疑虑等现象和碰到的实际困难，积极做好稳定政策、稳定人心和稳定生产的工作。目前，福建乡镇企业发展速度已明显回落，全省乡镇企业固定资产投资额比上年压缩了40％，1—9月，乡镇企业总产值增长率比去年同期回落28个百分点，其中工业产值增长率回落近31个百分点。与此同时，经济效益提高，实现利税比去年同期增长25％左右。外向型企业发展势头良好。今年以来各地乡镇企业签订的吸收外资合同就达500多项，比历年吸收外资的总和还多。
    进入下半年，福建省乡镇企业由于受各种因素的影响，一度曾出现较大波动。省委、省政府和各级领导机构认为，乡镇企业不治理不行，不整顿不行，不稳定也不行。稳不住乡镇企业就难以稳住农村经济，尤其外向型出口创汇企业对福建事关重大。稳定乡镇企业首先要稳定政策，稳定人心。因此，他们积极做好中央方针政策的宣传解释工作，省委、省政府负责同志多次在会议上谈乡镇企业的问题，引导各级干部和广大群众正确认识治理整顿和深化改革、治理整顿和稳定发展的关系，消除了一些人的疑虑，提高了各级干部投身治理整顿的自觉性。同时，针对本省的实际，制订和划清了一些政策界限。比如，由于历史的原因和特殊的条件，福建省各地股份制乡镇企业较多，有人曾经担心、观望，不敢发展生产。省有关部门根据调查研究，肯定了劳动者联合兴办合作经营企业这一形式，提出凡属自愿联合，合股经营，共同劳动，民主管理，实行按劳分配和股金分红，在税后利润中提取一定比例作为公共积累的企业，仍继续按省1987年有关文件规定“视同集体经济，给予享受集体企业待遇。”此外还制订了供销人员政策等。由于政策稳定，人心稳定，生产也得到进一步稳定和发展。目前，外商和很多台湾商人纷纷来到这里，或订合同或立意向或考察，记者所见的外商和台湾商人，都表示对前途充满信心。外向型乡镇企业将在福建得到进一步发展。
