Africans love animals. This is what a friend from the African business world told me. He said that products with animal patterns are very popular in Africa.

After he mentioned it, I noticed that the "animals" in the African market are indeed dazzling—tigers, leopards, monkeys, elephants, crocodiles, cows, sheep, horses, hippos, zebras, cats, dogs, rabbits, giraffes, chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, cranes, eagles, flamingos… If you were to collect all the animals from the patterns on these products, you would have enough for a whole zoo!

It is said that Africans' love for animals has an ancient tradition. The ancestors of black people once had the custom of using short-snouted crocodiles as guards; some tribes even revered crocodiles and snakes as water deities, treating them with great respect. Some prints and wood carvings often feature snakes coiled around masks, with snake heads pointing skyward, showing that snakes are considered supreme in the minds of some people.

In modern times, some famous black leaders love animals, respect animals, and even refer to themselves as animals or use certain animals as their symbols. This not only has been passed down as a beautiful story but has also increased the value of some animals. The late President of Guinea, Sekou Toure, was affectionately called "Sili" (which means "elephant" in Susu language). During a campaign rally before Guinea's independence in 1958, tens of thousands of voters chanted "Sili, Sili, Sili" in support of Toure. After independence, Guinea's currency was also named "Sili." The love of Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) President Houphouët-Boigny for animals seems even deeper and more extensive. Outside the walls of the presidential palace in the political capital, Yamoussoukro, there is a crocodile pond covering dozens of hectares. Large and small crocodiles gather in groups, countless in number. Special caretakers feed the crocodiles live chickens every day, making this new city a major attraction. The president also said, "We should sleep with our eyes open like crocodiles," to be vigilant against foreign invasions and subversion. Such a call to learn from crocodiles has made crocodiles famous.

Côte d'Ivoire people respect and love crocodiles, and many even keep them. The animal park in the economic capital, Abidjan, has the largest crocodile pond in West Africa; the crocodile breeding research institute there has even hired a crocodile breeding expert from West Germany. They breed large numbers of young crocodiles and release them into the original forests, allowing these ancient animals, similar to dinosaurs, to reproduce and thrive. Abidjan people not only keep crocodiles at home for entertainment but also make a living from them.

The author once saw a large oil painting featuring President Houphouët-Boigny with an elephant, a goat, and a crocodile. At first glance, one might wonder: how could a national leader be painted with a few animals? Upon inquiry, it turned out that the elephant is the national symbol of Côte d'Ivoire, the goat is the president's personal symbol (leader), and the crocodile is the president's "favorite animal." The artist's admiration for the animals in the painting expresses love for the president and is a masterpiece of "Africans love animals."

Animals are not only popular in the political arena of black Africa but also have a significant influence in the world of arts. Animals often become important themes in literary and artistic creations. Writing about animals, drawing animals, performing with animals, and singing about animals have become common. Real animals like hippos and elephants often perform on stage. In the green fields of black Africa, "animals" are also very lively. Look at the football teams: Côte d'Ivoire's "Elephants," Tanzania's "Lions," and Kenya's "Cheetahs" are all very active.

Africans not only love animals but also pay attention to protecting them, especially those rare animals that are on the verge of extinction.

The Kenyan government announced that it will cooperate with other countries to ban the global trade of ivory to protect African elephants. It also proposed holding an international conference to call on more than a hundred countries to support the ban on ivory trade.

Côte d'Ivoire has started construction on the world's largest natural animal park in Abokouamekro in its central region, covering an area of 62,500 hectares, allowing animals from various continents to "live under basically completely free conditions."

    非洲人爱动物
    熊善吾
    非洲人爱动物。这是一位非洲企业界朋友告诉我的。他说，有动物图案的商品在非洲就是好销。
    经他这么一提醒，我注意到在非洲市场上的“动物”可真令人目不暇接——虎，豹，猴，大象，鳄鱼，牛，羊，马，河马，斑马，猫，狗，兔，长颈鹿，鸡，鸭，鹅，鸽，鹤，鹰，火烈鸟……如果把商品图案上的这些动物收集在一起，简直够上个动物园了！
    据说非洲黑人爱动物有其古老的传统。黑人的祖先曾经有过利用短吻鳄当警卫的习俗；有的部族甚至把鳄鱼和蛇当作水神，备加敬重。有些版画、木雕，常见蛇绕脸谱，蛇头冲天，可见蛇在一些人心目中是至高无上的。
    在当代，一些著名的黑人领袖爱动物，敬动物，甚至以动物自称，或将某种动物当作自己的象征，不仅被人们传为美谈，更使一些动物身价倍增。几内亚已故总统塞古·杜尔的爱称便是“西利”（苏苏语“大象”之意）。在1958年独立前的一次竞选大会上，成千上万选民高呼“西利，西利，西利”，支持杜尔竞选。独立后，几内亚的货币也以“西利”命名。科特迪瓦（象牙海岸）总统乌弗埃——博瓦尼对动物的爱似乎更深沉，更广泛。政治首都亚穆苏克罗总统府墙外建有几十公顷的鳄鱼池。大小鳄鱼成群结队，不计其数。专门的饲养员每天定时用活鸡喂养那一条条张着血嘴的鳄鱼，成了总统家乡这座新兴城市的一大名胜。总统还说过“要像鳄鱼一样睁着眼睛睡觉”，以警惕外来侵略颠覆。这样一个要向鳄鱼学习的号召，使鳄鱼声名大振。
    科特迪瓦人敬鳄，爱鳄，不少人还养鳄。经济首都阿比让的动物园里有西非最大的鳄鱼池；这里的鳄鱼养殖研究所还聘请了西德的养鳄专家；他们大量繁殖幼鳄送往原始森林放生，让这种跟恐龙一般古老的动物得以生殖繁衍。阿比让人既有在家养鳄消遣的，还有养鳄营生的。
    笔者曾经看到一幅大型油画把乌弗埃——博瓦尼总统跟大象、山羊与鳄鱼画在一起。乍见一愣：怎么能把一位国家元首跟几头动物画在一起？经打听，原来大象是科特迪瓦国家的象征，山羊正是总统本人的象征（带头羊），鳄鱼是总统的“爱物”。画家笔下对动物的推崇正表达了对总统的爱，更是一幅“黑人爱动物”的杰作。
    动物不仅在黑非洲政坛走俏，在文艺园地也颇有影响。动物常成文艺创作的重要题材。写动物、画动物、演动物、唱动物已屡见不鲜。真正的动物如河马、大象等等还常登台表演。在黑非洲的绿茵场上，“动物”更是活灵活现。看看足球队吧，科特迪瓦的“大象”，坦桑尼亚的“狮子”，肯尼亚的“豹”都很活跃。
    非洲人爱动物，更注意保护动物，特别是保护那些濒临灭绝的珍稀动物。
    肯尼亚政府宣布它将同其它国家合作在世界范围内禁止买卖象牙，以便保护非洲大象。它还建议举行国际会议呼吁世界上百个国家来支持禁止象牙贸易。
    科特迪瓦已在它的中部阿博库阿迈克罗动工兴建面积为6.25万公顷的世界上最大的天然动物园，让来自各大洲的动物“将在这基本上完全自由的条件下生活”。
