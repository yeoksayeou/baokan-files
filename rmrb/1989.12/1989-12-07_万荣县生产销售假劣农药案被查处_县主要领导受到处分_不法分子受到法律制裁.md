The Ministry of Supervision, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Shanxi Provincial Supervision Bureau, and relevant departments in the Yuncheng Region, recently conducted a serious investigation into the production and sale of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province. The main leaders of the Wanrong County Committee and County Government have received disciplinary and administrative penalties. The lawbreakers involved have been punished according to the law.

According to the investigation, Wanrong County has been producing and selling fake and substandard agricultural and rodenticides for three years. In 1986, the county produced and sold 246 tons of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals and 90 tons of rodenticides. In 1987, the county produced and sold 430 tons of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals and 2.78 tons of rodenticides. In 1988, the production and sale of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals further escalated, reaching 1,241.19 tons, an increase of four times compared to 1986. The issue involved 9 townships, 21 enterprises, and some individual operators, with the majority of the fake and substandard agricultural chemicals being sold to 14 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu.

Wanrong County produced and sold 10 types of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals, with the most significant quantities being fake Furadan and substandard Parathion. The methods used to produce these fake and substandard agricultural chemicals were despicable and varied: some mixed sand from the Yellow River with red dye, packaged it in bags labeled "Jiangsu Tongshan Agricultural Chemical Factory," and passed it off as Furadan; some mixed sulfur powder with lime to make a sulfur-lime mixture, added kerosene, and affixed a counterfeit "Parathion" label; some diluted genuine "DDT" pesticide solution with large amounts of benzene or diesel, and repackaged it as substandard agricultural chemicals. These fake and substandard agricultural chemicals severely harmed agricultural production in the areas where they were used, causing significant economic losses and adverse effects.

It is understood that the main reason for Wanrong County's continuous production and sale of fake and substandard agricultural and rodenticides over three years is that the county committee and county government did not attach enough importance to the issue and failed to enforce strict controls. The relevant leaders and departments of the county government were derelict in their duties, and management was chaotic. Some officials only pursued local or departmental interests, unscrupulously harming farmers and damaging overall interests.

For this reason, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government recently decided to give Li Wenying, the county committee secretary, a serious warning within the party; Ma Dongbo, the county magistrate, a demotion in rank and a warning within the party; and Xie Zhancui, the deputy county magistrate, a demotion in rank and the removal of his position as an alternate member of the county committee.

    万荣县生产销售假劣农药案被查处
    县主要领导受到处分　不法分子受到法律制裁
    本报讯　监察部会同农业部、化工部、山西省监察厅及运城地区有关部门，最近严肃查处了山西万荣县生产销售假劣农药的问题。万荣县委、县政府主要领导分别受到党纪、政纪处分。涉案的不法分子受到法律制裁。
    据调查，万荣县制售假劣农、鼠药已有3年。1986年该县制售假劣农药246吨、鼠药90吨，1987年该县又制售假劣农药430吨、鼠药2.78吨。1988年该县制售假劣农药进一步泛滥，数量高达1241.19吨，比1986年增加4倍，涉及9个乡镇、21个企业和一些个体户，绝大部分假劣农药已销往北京、河北、陕西、江苏等14个省市。
    万荣县制售的假劣农药有10个品种，制售量大的，主要有假呋喃丹、假劣氧化乐果两种。制造假劣农药的手段卑劣多样：有的将黄河边的砂子添加红色颜料混合搅拌，装入印有“江苏铜山农药厂”字样的袋子，冒充呋喃丹；有的将硫磺粉与白灰做成石硫合剂，加入煤油，贴上“氧化乐果”的伪造商标；有的将“敌敌畏”正品药液兑入大量的苯或柴油，分装成劣质农药。这些假劣农药严重危害了使用地区的农业生产，造成重大经济损失和恶劣影响。
    据了解，万荣县连续3年生产销售假劣农、鼠药，主要原因是县委、县政府重视不够，查禁不力，县政府有关领导和主管部门失职、渎职，管理工作混乱，有的只追求本地或本部门的利益，不惜坑农害农，损害全局利益。
    为此，山西省委、省政府最近作出决定，给予万荣县县委书记李文渊党内严重警告处分；县长马东波行政记大过、党内警告处分；副县长谢占魁行政撤职及撤销县委候补委员职务处分。
