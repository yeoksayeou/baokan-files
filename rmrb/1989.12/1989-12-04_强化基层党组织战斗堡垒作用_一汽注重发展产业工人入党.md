The Party Committee of the First Automobile Works has prioritized the recruitment of industrial workers into the Party as a major task in Party building. Over the past year, 398 workers have been admitted into the Party, accounting for 56.6% of the total number of new Party members in the factory.

Industrial workers are the core of the working class. Recruiting industrial workers, especially those on the production frontline, into the Party is a crucial measure to strengthen the role of grassroots Party organizations as fortresses and to promote enterprise development. Based on this understanding, the Party Committee of the First Automobile Works has included the recruitment of industrial workers, especially frontline production workers, into the Party as an important agenda item in Party building. They have formulated organizational development work plans and set specific requirements. Various professional factory Party committees, in accordance with the overall deployment of the factory Party committee, have developed specific plans for cultivation, education, and selection. They have also created conditions for activists, systematically and step-by-step, to educate them on Party basics, and consciously assign them responsibilities in various activities. This ensures that they are developed into Party members one by one as they mature.

The new Party members are mostly production backbones and advanced models, enjoying high prestige among the masses. New Party member Zhang Wei is a young worker from the Gearbox Factory. Through diligent self-study, he has mastered a set of excellent skills in numerical control machine tool adjustment and has trained a group of technical backbones. Over the years, he has adjusted more than 40 imported advanced numerical control machine tools, saving the country hundreds of thousands of yuan in machine tool adjustment fees. He has been named a "Workplace Star" by the factory and a "Labor Creation Model" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The working environment of the Blast Furnace Class in the Foundry Factory is harsh, with high labor intensity. In the past, due to poor management, labor discipline was lax, and production and quality were at the bottom of the workshop. Many people wanted to transfer out of the class. After new Party member Mao Zhenyou took over as the class leader, he strictly managed the class, implemented the economic responsibility system, and transformed the class's appearance in just one year. Now, the class is stable, and production and quality have leaped to the top of the workshop.

Due to the emphasis on recruiting Party members from industrial workers, the desire of the broad masses of workers to join the Party organization has been greatly enhanced, and more and more workers are actively applying to join the Party. Currently, more than half of the Party activists in the entire factory are workers.

    强化基层党组织战斗堡垒作用
    一汽注重发展产业工人入党
    本报讯　第一汽车制造厂党委把发展产业工人入党作为党的建设的一件大事来抓，去年以来，共发展398名工人入党，占全厂党员发展总数的56.6％。
    产业工人是工人阶级的核心，发展产业工人特别是生产一线工人入党，是强化基层党组织战斗堡垒作用，促进企业发展的一项重要措施。基于这种认识，一汽党委把发展产业工人特别是一线生产工人入党列入党的建设的重要日程，制定组织发展工作计划，提出具体要求。各专业厂党委根据总厂党委统一部署，制定培养教育、考核选拔的具体方案，并为积极分子创造条件，有计划、有步骤地对他们进行党的基本知识教育，同时在工作中有意识地给他们压担子，让他们在各类活动中经受锻炼，做到成熟一个发展一个。
    新入党的同志大都是生产骨干和先进模范人物，在群众中有较高威信。新党员张伟是变速箱厂青年工人，他靠刻苦自学，掌握了一手过硬的数控机床调整技术，并带出一批技术骨干，几年来先后调整了引进的先进数控机床40多台，为国家节约机床调整费用上百万元，被厂树为“岗位新星”，团中央命名为“劳动创造标兵”。铸造厂冲天炉班工作环境艰苦，劳动强度大，过去由于管理较差，劳动纪律涣散，产量、质量排在车间最后，很多人都想调离班组。新党员毛振友到这个班担任班长后，严格班组管理，落实经济责任制，仅用一年时间就使班组面貌焕然一新。现在这个班人心安定，产量和质量一跃成为全车间第一名。
    一汽由于重视在产业工人中发展党员，大大增强了广大工人靠近党组织的愿望，越来越多的工人积极要求入党。目前，在全厂党的积极分子中工人占一半以上。　（李士政　赵晓光）
