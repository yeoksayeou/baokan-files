According to a report in the December 25th edition of the *Market News*, the Beijing Clock and Eyewear Company has been innovating in its service offerings. Various retail stores under the company have proactively gone to rural areas and factories to provide eyeglass fitting and prescription services, achieving both economic and social benefits.

The Morning Light Eyewear Store, located in Beijing's Dazhalan, sent a team led by Manager Yang Qingzhu to visit the education bureaus in the suburbs of Daxing, Fangshan, Yanqing, Changping, and Shunyi this past summer. The team conducted market research and provided mobile eyeglass fitting services. On one occasion, the store's team served the education system in Daxing County, providing 11 days of service in schools. They examined the vision of over 1,200 people, fitted 850 pairs of glasses, repaired over 1,000 pairs of glasses, and generated revenue of 450,000 yuan. In August, the Daming Eyewear Store sent a service team to various industrial and mining enterprises in Tianjin, generating sales of over 10 million yuan in just a few days. In early September, the Jingyi Eyewear Company dispatched a team to four large enterprises in Chengde, Hebei, including the Chengde Mining Machinery Factory. The community was delighted by the new and convenient service. Over the past half-year, Jingyi Eyewear Company has seen significant operational benefits. From August to November alone, its sales revenue increased by nearly 150,000 yuan compared to the same period last year.

    下乡下厂验光配镜方便群众
    本报讯  据12月25日出版的《市场报》报道：北京钟表眼镜公司在开拓服务上作文章，各零售商店主动下乡下厂为消费者验光配镜，经济效益和社会效益双丰收。
    坐落在北京大栅栏的晨光眼镜店，今年盛夏，由经理杨庆祝亲自带队，走遍了大兴、房山、延庆、昌平、顺义等京郊各县教育局，一面进行市场调查，一面进行巡回验光配镜。一次，这家眼镜店的小分队来到大兴县教育系统，深入学校一连服务了11天，验光者达1200多人，配镜850副，修理眼镜1000多副，共收入4.5万元。8月，大明眼镜店服务小分队用汽车带着货深入到天津市的一些工矿企业，几天时间经营额达10多万元。精益眼镜公司9月初派了一支小分队驱车来到河北承德矿山机械厂等4家大型企业，群众见了又新奇又高兴。半年来，精益眼镜公司开拓经营效益显著。仅8至11月，营业收入就比去年同期增长近15万元。
