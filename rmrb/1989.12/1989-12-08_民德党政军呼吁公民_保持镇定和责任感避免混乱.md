In light of the current political situation in the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the government, and the National People's Army have called on all citizens to remain calm, composed, and highly responsible to prevent anarchy and chaos.

According to reports, the preparatory committee for the special congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a statement on December 4th, expressing deep concern over signs of mob rule and the use of violence to attack state institutions. The committee urged all citizens to remain calm and highly responsible, especially to refrain from violent actions, and to absolutely not allow anyone to engage in illegal activities, anarchism, or create chaos. The committee called on all party members to work from their respective positions to maintain social stability and rationality for the sake of the country's future.

The committee's spokesperson, Zimerman, also requested on December 3rd that the government maintain social stability and remain calm.

The German News Agency reported on December 6th that the government and other social organizations in the German Democratic Republic have also issued appeals regarding the current situation.

The government of the German Democratic Republic today called on citizens to remain quiet and calm. The appeal stated that the National People's Army, in accordance with the constitution, is tasked with protecting the peaceful lives of citizens from external attacks. The National People's Army is equipped for this purpose.

The government of the German Democratic Republic resolutely called for an end to all attacks on National People's Army targets and facilities, allowing only representatives of the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic to enter these targets and facilities.

The National People's Army and border troops appealed, saying, "We share the concern for maintaining peace and respect the efforts we have made for this purpose. Only through joint action can we maintain the independence of the German Democratic Republic and save our country from anarchy and chaos."

The religious community in the German Democratic Republic also called today for calm and the avoidance of violence.
