In recent years, the number of people traveling by airplane worldwide has been increasing at an annual rate of seven percent. By the 1990s, the business of global airlines will be even more prosperous. Experts predict that the world airliner market will exhibit some new characteristics:

A large number of aircraft will be retired. To use faster, longer-range, and higher-capacity aircraft, approximately 2,500 airliners will be retired in the next five years, accounting for about forty percent of the world's total airliners.

A wave of orders will emerge. According to statistics, in 1988 alone, airlines ordered 976 jet airliners, totaling $43 billion. This ordering trend will continue for the next ten years. Today, even if you have cash in hand, you cannot immediately purchase an airplane. The earliest delivery time for ordered aircraft is three years from now.

New aircraft models will be introduced. To enhance competitiveness, major aircraft manufacturers worldwide are accelerating the development and launching of new aircraft models. Boeing recently developed a B-747/400 jet airliner, which can accommodate 412 passengers and has a range of 11,900 kilometers; McDonnell Douglas will launch the MD-11 airliner next year, which can carry 276 to 495 passengers and has a range of 12,985 kilometers, allowing it to fly directly to any destination in the world; Airbus aircraft are renowned for their high degree of computerization. In the 1990s, Airbus aircraft will continue to maintain this advantage.

The used aircraft market will thrive. Since the 1980s, the aviation industry in developing countries has developed rapidly, but many airlines lack funds and cannot afford to purchase large numbers of new aircraft. However, a significant portion of the aircraft retired by Western airlines can continue to be used after minor repairs, and their prices are much lower than new aircraft. Therefore, the used aircraft market will be particularly thriving in the 1990s.

    90年代世界客机市场
    近年来，世界上乘飞机旅行者，一直以每年百分之七的速度递增。到九十年代，世界航空公司生意将更为兴隆。专家们预测，世界客机市场将呈现一些新特点：
    大量飞机退役。为使用速度更快、航程更远、载客更多的飞机，今后五年内，约有二千五百架客机将退出现役，约占世界客机总数的百分之四十。
    出现订购浪潮。据统计，仅在一九八八年，各航空公司订购的喷气式客机，就有九百七十六架，金额达四百三十亿美元。这一订购势头，将在今后十年内保持下去。今天，即使你手持现金，也无法马上买到飞机。订购的飞机，最快也要三年后才能交货。
    推出新型飞机。为增加竞争能力，世界主要飞机制造公司，正在加紧研制并不断推出新型飞机。波音公司最近研制出一种B—747＼400型喷气式客机，它可以容纳四百一十二名乘客，航程能达一万一千九百公里；麦道公司将于明年推出的MD—11型客机，可载客二百七十六至四百九十五人，航程一万二千九百八十五公里，能直飞至世界任何地方；空中客车公司生产的飞机，则以其高度的计算机化而闻名于世。九十年代，该公司飞机将继续保持这一优势。
    旧机市场兴旺。八十年代以来，第三世界国家民航事业发展迅猛，但它们中不少航空公司缺乏资金，难以添置大量的新型飞机。而西方航空公司退役的飞机中，有相当部分只要稍加维修，仍可继续使用，其价钱大大低于新飞机。因此，九十年代，旧飞机市场将格外兴旺。　（王　文）
