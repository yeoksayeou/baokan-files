Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 3rd.

U.S. President Bush and Soviet leader Gorbachev held their second round of talks this morning on the Soviet cruise ship "Gorky" off the coast of Malta. After the talks, the two leaders held a joint press conference on the ship, concluding this informal summit. Both sides discussed the situation in Eastern Europe, arms control, and the situation in Central America during the talks. The media believes that the leaders of the two countries did not reach an agreement on arms reduction and other major issues.

According to U.S. officials, Bush made a one-hour speech at the start of the talks on the 2nd, proposing about twenty items, including: Baker's visit to the Soviet Union next month to accelerate the progress of U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons negotiations, and hopes to resolve the remaining differences in the nuclear treaty before the summit next year; the U.S. agrees not to produce binary chemical weapons after the international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons comes into effect, if the Soviet Union agrees to reduce its stockpiled chemical weapons to 20% of the current level; the U.S. and the Soviet Union immediately begin negotiations on a trade agreement between the two countries, and the U.S. government seeks to provide export-import bank loans to the Soviet Union, etc.

According to reports, both sides agreed to hold a formal U.S.-Soviet summit in the latter half of June 1990 in the United States. U.S. President Bush hopes to reach several new agreements on arms control and economic and trade issues at the summit. Bush also said that he agrees with Gorbachev's proposal in his letter in September, which is to hold a summit of NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in Vienna by the end of 1990 to sign the treaty on the reduction of conventional military forces in Europe.

The two leaders expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting at the joint press conference and made positive evaluations of the meeting.

Bush said that both sides deepened their understanding of each other's views, laying the foundation for future progress on a wide range of issues.

He said that the U.S. and the Soviet Union do not want to plan the future for Europe and other countries in the world, but he believes that the cooperative relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union makes the future of the world more secure and better, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union can each contribute to ending the division and military confrontation in Europe.

Gorbachev said that both sides had a frank exchange of views on major issues during the meeting, and that such an exchange of views was beneficial.

He believes that major issues such as the world, Europe, and arms reduction should be resolved politically, and he is optimistic about reaching an agreement on nuclear and conventional arms reduction next year. Gorbachev also said that in dealing with international issues, one should avoid exaggeration and must be cautious, and that U.S.-Soviet relations are now at a critical stage, and both sides must responsibly face the challenges.

    美苏首脑非正式会晤结束
    讨论了东欧局势、军备控制和中美洲局势等问题
    本报华盛顿12月3日电　记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天上午在马耳他沿海的苏联客轮“高尔基”号上举行第二轮会谈。会谈后，两国领导人在客轮上举行了联合记者招待会，结束了这次苏美首脑非正式会晤。双方在会谈中讨论了东欧局势、军备控制和中美洲形势等问题。舆论界认为美苏两国领导人未就裁军问题和其他重大问题达成协议。
    据美国官员称，布什在2日会谈开始时作了一个小时的发言，提出了一、二十项建议，这些建议中还包括：贝克于下个月去苏访问，以加速美苏核武器谈判进程，并希望在明年首脑会晤前解决核条约中遗留的分歧问题；美国同意在国际禁止化学武器条约生效后不再生产二元化学武器，如果苏联同意把储存的化学武器削减到20％的水平；美苏立即就两国贸易协定开始谈判，以及美国政府争取向苏联提供进出口银行贷款等。
    据报道，双方同意将于1990年6月下半月在美国举行一次正式的美苏首脑会晤，美国总统布什希望在首脑会晤时两国就军备控制和经济、贸易达成若干新的协议。布什还表示，他同意戈尔巴乔夫9月在给他的信件中提出的建议，即在1990年年底之前在维也纳举行北约和华约国家的首脑会议，签订削减欧洲常规军事力量条约。
    两国领导人在联合记者招待会上对会晤的结果表示满意，并对会晤作出了积极的评价。
    布什说，双方加深了对彼此观点的了解，为今后在广泛问题上取得进展打下了基础。
    他说，美苏并不想为欧洲和世界其他国家谋划前途，但他认为美苏的合作关系使世界的将来更加安全、更加美好，美苏各自可为结束欧洲分裂、军事对抗作出贡献。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，双方在会晤中就重大问题坦率地交换了意见，这种意见交换是有益的。
    他认为，对于世界、欧洲和裁军等重大问题都应以政治办法加以解决，他对明年就核裁军和常规裁军达成协议表示乐观，戈尔巴乔夫还说，在对待国际问题上应该避免夸张而必须谨慎对待，苏美关系现在处于关键阶段，双方必须负责地对待挑战。
