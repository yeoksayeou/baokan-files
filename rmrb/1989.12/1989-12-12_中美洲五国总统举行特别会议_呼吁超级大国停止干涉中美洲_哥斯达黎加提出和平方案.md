Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, December 10th.

The presidents of five Central American countries held a special meeting today in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, to discuss urgent issues facing the peace process in the region. This is the sixth meeting of the five Central American presidents since 1986.

According to reports from Mexico City Television, the attendees included Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, Honduran President José Azcona, and Guatemalan President Marco Vinicio Cerezo. It is reported that the meeting will discuss an 11-point proposal for peace put forward by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. The key points include urging the United States and the Soviet Union to take a more active role in achieving peace in Central America; demanding that the Salvadoran government and the guerrillas hold talks within 10 days in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela; requiring the United States and the Soviet Union to send representatives as observers to the aforementioned talks; demanding that the Nicaraguan government hold talks with the anti-government forces within 8 days in Mexico City, and similarly requiring representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union to attend the talks; the peace proposal also calls for the United Nations military observer group to supervise the ceasefire in El Salvador and Nicaragua.

The summit was originally scheduled to be held on December 8th in Nicaragua. However, due to the suspension of diplomatic relations between El Salvador and Nicaragua, the meeting was called off. Guatemalan President Cerezo suggested holding the meeting in Guatemala; however, Nicaraguan President Ortega believed that Guatemala lacked security, so the meeting was changed to be held today in San José. The host, President Arias, said that the peace process in Central America is facing its most difficult period. He called on the superpowers to stop interfering in Central America and to fulfill their responsibilities for the peace process. Salvadoran President Cristiani today accused Nicaragua of aiding Salvadoran guerrillas and said that El Salvador did not want to sever relations with Nicaragua; it had only withdrawn its diplomatic representatives from Nicaragua.

    中美洲五国总统举行特别会议
    呼吁超级大国停止干涉中美洲
    哥斯达黎加提出和平方案
    本报墨西哥城12月10日电　记者郭伟成报道：中美洲5国总统今天在哥斯达黎加首都圣何塞举行特别会议，讨论该地区和平进程面临的紧迫问题。这是中美洲5国总统从1986年以来举行的第6次会议。
    据墨西哥城电视台报道，与会的有尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加、萨尔瓦多总统克里斯蒂亚尼、洪都拉斯总统阿斯科纳和危地马拉总统塞雷索。据报道，这次会议将讨论哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯提出的一项包括11点建议的和平方案，其要点为，敦促美苏两国对实现中美洲和平进程承担更为积极的义务；要求萨尔瓦多政府和游击队10天内在委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯进行谈判；美苏两国派代表作为观察员出席上述谈判；要求尼加拉瓜政府与反政府武装8天内在墨西哥城举行谈判，并同样要求美苏两国代表出席谈判；和平方案还要求联合国军事观察小组监督萨尔瓦多与尼加拉瓜两国国内停火。
    这次首脑会议原定12月8日在尼加拉瓜举行。由于萨尔瓦多与尼加拉瓜中止外交关系而告吹。危地马拉总统塞雷索曾建议会议改在危地马拉举行；但是，尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加认为危地马拉缺乏安全，因此，会议改为今天在圣何塞举行。东道主阿里亚斯总统说，中美洲和平进程正处于最困难的时期。他呼吁超级大国停止干预中美洲，并对和平进程承担应有的义务。萨尔瓦多总统克里斯蒂亚尼今天指责尼加拉瓜援助萨尔瓦多游击队，并说萨尔瓦多并不是要断绝与尼加拉瓜的关系；只是撤回了驻尼加拉瓜的外交代表。
