Intensified Market Competition Among Western Powers

Since this year, the United States, Western Europe, and Japan have been utilizing their respective economic advantages to infiltrate each other's markets, leading to intensified competition among them for market share.

This competition is first evident in the United States' aggressive push for trade protectionism. In April, the U.S. government, based on the "Super 301" clause of the Comprehensive Trade Act passed by the U.S. Congress last year, unilaterally announced a list of 36 countries and regions that it deemed to be engaging in "unfair" trade practices. Japan, Brazil, and India were listed as countries that needed to prioritize resolving issues, requiring them to remove trade barriers against the United States and open their markets to U.S. goods within 18 months, or face trade sanctions. This arrogant move by the United States has sparked strong opposition and dissatisfaction from countries around the world.

Japan is the primary target of the U.S.'s trade offensive. On one hand, the United States uses the "Super 301" clause as a weapon to pressure Japan to open its market to specific U.S. goods; on the other hand, it proposes negotiations with Japan to address Japan's structural trade barriers, aiming to clear the way for U.S. goods and services to enter the Japanese market comprehensively. So far, the trade talks between the two countries have been held multiple times, but due to differing stances, the negotiations remain at a stalemate.

Currently, in the trade relations among Western countries, not only are the U.S.-Japan tensions prominent, but there are also frequent frictions among the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe over specific commodities.

Next, in the context of strengthening trade protectionism, several Western powers, in order to develop their own economies and protect their own territories, are hastening the formation of regional economic and trade organizations, further advancing economic bloc formation.

The European Community is accelerating its steps to establish an internal unified market by the end of 1992. According to reports, of the 279 measures to be taken to establish a unified market, half have been completed by the end of May this year. Once the unified market is established, it is estimated that the Community will increase its output by $244 billion annually, significantly enhancing its economic strength.

Facing competition and challenges from Western Europe, in January this year, the United States and Canada officially implemented the Free Trade Agreement they signed, which stipulates the gradual elimination of various tariff barriers between the two countries over a ten-year period, forming a free trade zone in North America.

In early November, Australia, the United States, Japan, ASEAN, and 12 other countries around the Pacific held their first ministerial-level meeting in Canberra to discuss economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. This meeting did not reach an agreement on organizational mechanisms but reflected the willingness and intentions of the participating countries to cooperate economically. However, since the Asia-Pacific region is currently the fastest-growing economic region in the world, if the relevant countries in this region can strengthen economic cooperation, it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the global economy. Therefore, this meeting has received widespread attention and importance from countries around the world. According to the Wall Street Journal, an official from the Community once stated that if an economic cooperation organization is formed in the Asia-Pacific region, the Community will take a "negative" attitude. This shows that although the establishment of various trade blocs all claim to be non-exclusive, in reality, they all consider each other as competitors, and the competition is very intense.

Finally, to avoid interference from trade protectionism and to capture more market share in each other's domestic markets, the U.S., Japan, and European countries have strengthened mutual investment and corporate mergers and acquisitions. In recent years, Japan has developed rapidly in this area, particularly noteworthy. According to statistics, in 1988, Japan's direct investment in the United States reached $53.4 billion, an increase of 52% from 1987. The investment covers various industries. By January 1989, there were 421 Japanese-funded enterprises in the Community, an increase of 1.6 times from 157 in 1983.

According to recent statistics from the Yamato Securities Company, Japan acquired 315 companies in the United States and 52 companies in the Community in 1988, while in the first nine months of this year, it acquired 294 companies in the United States and 69 companies in the Community, nearly or exceeding the total for the whole of last year. The massive influx of Japanese capital into the United States and Western Europe has caused widespread concern locally. In the United States, some even call for the government to fundamentally revise its policy towards Japan. Japanese public opinion believes that U.S.-Japan friction has entered a new stage.

Economic development imbalances are a law of capitalist economic development. Under this law, the economic strength comparisons among Western countries will continue to change. The competition for technological advantages, talent, and market share will inevitably intensify. Leaders want to maintain their advantages and existing positions, while followers want to catch up, making conflicts and confrontations inevitable. Although they may sometimes make temporary compromises and concessions on certain issues, the overall trend will be one of increasing conflicts.

    西方大国争夺市场斗争加剧
    新华社记者　张锡纯
    今年以来，美国、西欧、日本都在利用各自的经济优势，相互渗透，倾轧激化，从而使它们对市场的争夺进一步加剧。
    这个斗争首先表现在，美国以咄咄逼人的态势，大力推行贸易保护主义政策。今年四月，美国政府根据美国国会去年通过的综合贸易法的“超级三○一”条款，单方面宣布一批对其实行“不公平”贸易的三十六个国家和地区的名单，并把日本、巴西、印度列为需要优先解决问题的国家，要它们在十八个月内取消对美国的贸易壁垒，为美国商品开放市场，否则将对这些国家实行贸易制裁。美国的这一蛮横行径引起了世界各国的强烈反对和不满。
    日本是美国贸易进攻的主要对象。美国一方面以“超级三○一”条款为武器，要挟日本为美国的单项商品开放市场；另一方面，又提出要同日本就解决日本的结构性贸易障碍举行谈判，想用釜底抽薪的办法，为美国商品劳务的全面打进日本市场扫清道路。迄今为止，两国贸易谈判虽已多次举行，但因双方各执一词，谈判一直处于僵持状态。
    当前，在西方国家的贸易关系方面，不仅美日矛盾尖锐突出，美、日、西欧三方在一些具体商品上的摩擦也层出不穷。
    其次，在贸易保护主义倾向不断加强的情况下，几个西方大国为了发展自己，保护自己的阵地，加紧组织地区性经贸组织，使经济集团化有了进一步发展。
    欧洲共同体为在一九九二年底前建成内部统一大市场而加紧前进的步伐。
    据报道，共同体建立统一大市场要采取的二百七十九项措施，至今年五月底已完成了一半。待统一大市场建成后，据估计，共同体每年可增加产值二千四百四十亿美元，经济实力将大为增强。
    面对西欧的竞争和挑战，今年一月，美国和加拿大签订的自由贸易协定正式宣布生效。它规定将在十年内逐步取消两国间的各种关税壁垒，在北美形成一个自由贸易区。
  十一月初，澳大利亚、美国、日本、东盟等环太平洋十二个国家，在西欧、北美经济集团化的推动下，在堪培拉举行了第一次部长级会议，讨论亚太地区的经济合作问题。这次会议没有在组织机制上达成协议，仅反映了与会各国经济合作的愿望和意向。但由于亚太地区是当前世界上经济发展速度最快的地区，这个地区的有关国家若能加强经济合作，对世界经济必将产生巨大影响，因此，这次会议仍然受到了世界各国的普遍关注和重视。据《华尔街日报》报道，共同体的一位官员曾经表示，如果亚太地区形成经济合作的组织，共同体将持“否定”态度。从这里可以看出，各个贸易集团的建立虽然都自称是非排他性的，但事实上彼此都以对方为竞争对手，斗争是十分激烈的。
    再次，为了避开贸易保护主义的干扰，在对方国内占领更多的市场份额，美日欧各国加强了相互间的投资和企业兼并活动。近年来，日本在这方面发展神速，表现得尤其令人瞩目。据统计，一九八八年，日本在美国的直接投资已达五百三十四亿美元，比一九八七年增加了百分之五十二。投资范围涉及各行各业。到一九八九年一月为止，设在共同体的日资企业已达四百二十一家，比一九八三年的一百五十七家增加了一点六倍。
    另据日本山一证券公司的最近统计，日本去年在美国和共同体兼并的企业分别为三百一十五家和五十二家，而今年一至九月，在这两地兼并的企业已分别达到二百九十四家和六十九家，接近或超过去年全年的总数。日本资本的大量涌入美国和西欧，已在当地引起人们的广泛不安。在美国，甚至有人要求政府从根本上修正对日本的政策。日本舆论认为，日美摩擦已进入一个新阶段。
    经济发展不平衡是资本主义经济发展的规律。在这一规律的作用下，西方各国的经济实力对比将不断发生变化。争夺科技优势，争夺人才及争夺市场的斗争必然会进一步发展。领先者要保持其优势和既得阵地，后来者要居上，因此矛盾对抗不可避免。尽管有时它们可能在某些问题上暂时作出妥协让步，但是总的趋势仍将是矛盾越来越尖锐。
