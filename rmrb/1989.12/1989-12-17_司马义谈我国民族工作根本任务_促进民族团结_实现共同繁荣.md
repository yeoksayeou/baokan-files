Sima Yi·Aimaiti, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said at the Second Ethnic Unity and Progress Awards Conference of Guizhou Province today that promoting ethnic unity and progress and gradually achieving common prosperity of all ethnic groups is always the fundamental task of our ethnic work.

He said, the highest interest of China is stability, and the common wish of people of all ethnic groups is stability. The great cause of socialism has continuously promoted the close unity of all ethnic groups in China. However, there are still some unstable factors in ethnic relations, and these cannot be eliminated in a short period. The main sources of these unstable factors are separatist elements and domestic and foreign reactionary forces. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the anti-socialist elements who fled abroad are still struggling desperately, trying to stir up trouble in China's ethnic relations; international reactionary forces are attempting to subvert and infiltrate China by destroying its ethnic unity. Under the leadership of the Party, all ethnic groups must naturally wage a resolute struggle against them to safeguard the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity.

Sima Yi said, some people are very concerned about whether the Party and the state can implement and how to implement the ethnic policies. On this point, Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech on National Day gave a clear answer. The third-generation leadership collective of China "will unswervingly continue to implement the policy of ethnic equality, ethnic unity, and common prosperity of all ethnic groups."

    司马义谈我国民族工作根本任务
    促进民族团结　实现共同繁荣
    据新华社贵阳12月16日电　（记者龙向超、鲁兴伦）全国政协副主席、国家民委主任司马义·艾买提，今天在贵州省第二次民族团结进步表彰大会上说，促进民族团结进步，逐步实现各民族共同繁荣始终是我们民族工作的根本任务。
    他说，中国的最高利益是稳定，各族人民的共同意愿是稳定。伟大的社会主义事业不断促进了我国各民族的亲密团结，但民族关系中也还存在一些不安定因素，并且不可能在短时间内消除。不安定因素主要来自分裂主义分子和国内外的反动势力。 北京平息反革命暴乱以后，逃亡国外的反社会主义分子困兽犹斗，企图在我国的民族关系上做其反动文章；国际反动势力妄图通过破坏我国的民族团结来进行颠覆、渗透。各族人民在党的领导下，为维护祖国统一和民族团结，理所当然地要同他们进行坚决的斗争。
    司马义说，有些人对党和国家的民族政策能否执行和如何贯彻执行十分关心。这一点，江泽民同志的国庆讲话中作了明确的回答，中国第三代领导集体“要坚定不移地继续贯彻执行民族平等、民族团结和各民族共同繁荣的方针”。
