Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 4th.

Hungary's currency, the forint, will be devalued by 10% against convertible foreign currencies starting from December 5th. This is the second devaluation of the forint this year, following a 6% devaluation in April.

According to a statement from the Hungarian National Bank, the deterioration of the international balance of payments and the continued growth of foreign debt have forced Hungary to take this measure.

The economic situation in Hungary is severe this year. Foreign debt has exceeded $20 billion. The original plan for the international balance of payments deficit was $600 million, but due to the relaxation of import controls and increased foreign travel and shopping by residents, a large amount of foreign exchange has flowed out, resulting in an international balance of payments deficit of $1.4 to $1.5 billion.

    匈牙利货币贬值
    新华社布达佩斯电  据匈通社12月4日报道，从12月5日起，匈牙利货币福林同可兑换外币的比价降低10％。这是匈福林今年第二次贬值，今年4月份，福林曾贬值6％。
    据匈国家银行的公报说，国际支付平衡恶化和外债继续增长使匈不得不采取使福林再次贬值的措施。
    今年匈经济形势严峻。目前外债已超出200亿美元。今年原计划国际支付平衡赤字为6亿美元，但由于放宽了进口和居民在国外旅游采购，大量外汇外流，使国际支付平衡赤字达14—15亿美元。
