Lei Jieqiong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Second Session of the China Democratic League today that the Communist Party of China is the core force leading our cause. Only socialism can develop China. This is a historical necessity and the people's choice. The China Democratic League has formed a fine tradition of firmly accepting the leadership of the Communist Party in its long revolutionary practice. The political turmoil of this spring and summer has further strengthened our conviction that we must accept the leadership of the Communist Party and follow the socialist path.

The main agenda of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Second Session of the China Democratic League is to seriously study the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party, review and summarize the work of the past year, and deploy the tasks for the future.

In the work report made by Lei Jieqiong on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, it was emphasized that the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party is a characteristic and advantage of our country's political system. The China Democratic League has a new type of friendly party relationship with the Communist Party, which is a comradely relationship, both closely cooperating and mutually supervising.

Lei Jieqiong pointed out that the China Democratic League is well aware of its historical position and has never been an opposition party and will never be one in the future. On the road ahead, no matter what storms we encounter, we will continue to firmly believe in the leadership of the Communist Party, adhere to the socialist political direction, and resolutely oppose all attempts to implement Western multi-party system in China.

When talking about how to implement the various tasks proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party, Lei Jieqiong said that the China Democratic League will focus on five key areas next year. First, around the central task of rectification and deepening reform, strengthen investigation and research, and actively participate in politics and policy-making. Second, strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and important documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and further strengthen ideological and political work. Third, continue to do good deeds and practical work for the material and spiritual civilization of socialism. Fourth, do a good job in overseas liaison work and actively serve the great cause of national reunification. Fifth, further strengthen organizational construction with the construction of the leading cadre team as the center.

Leaders of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Chen Shungli, Ge Zhicheng, Chu Zhuang, Ye Zhishan, Mei Xiangming, Deng Weizhi, and others attended the opening ceremony.

Also in attendance were Song Kun, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

    本报北京12月8日电　记者袁建达、李德金报道：全国人大常委会副委员长、民进中央主席雷洁琼今天在中国民主促进会八届二中全会上说，中国共产党是领导我们事业的核心力量，只有社会主义才能发展中国。这是历史的必然，人民的选择。民进在长期的革命实践中，形成了坚定不移地接受共产党领导的优良传统。经过今年春夏之交的政治风波，更坚定了我们必须接受中共领导、走社会主义道路的信念。
