Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th.

The "Theoretical Discussion Meeting on the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation" held by the Central Party School concluded today. The meeting emphasized that, given the current situation, strengthening theoretical work and raising theoretical levels are of particular importance to our Party. We must use the basic principles of Marxism to study new situations and answer new questions.

The meeting pointed out that in recent years, due to mistakes in the guiding ideology of some Party leaders, the erroneous theories of bourgeois liberalization have spread rampantly, causing confusion in thought and theory. Therefore, it is necessary to use Marxist theory to clear away the fog, correct the root causes, and unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the nation.

The meeting believes that under the current domestic and international situation, many new situations need to be studied, and many new questions need to be answered. Practice more than ever needs theory, and it calls for theory. Linking theory with current practice, studying, adhering to, and developing Marxism is a glorious mission bestowed by history upon the Communist Party of China and Chinese Marxists.

During the two-day meeting, Xu Ju, the Acting President of the Central Party School, and Vice President Qing Bingsi both spoke. They pointed out that the Central Party School, as an educational institution directly under the Party Central Committee with the goal of cultivating high and intermediate-level cadres, should make contributions in using Marxist principles to study new situations and answer new questions. It should apply a large number of research results to education, arming our high and intermediate-level cadres with creative Marxism. This will enable them, in the face of the severe domestic and international situation, to see the big picture, firm their beliefs, grasp the weapons, improve their political and theoretical qualities, strengthen and improve Party leadership, advance the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and complete the glorious mission of our Party in the international communist movement.

    中央党校理论讨论会认为
    理论工作要研究新情况回答新问题
    新华社北京十二月十三日电  （记者周立宪）由中共中央党校举办的“建国四十周年理论讨论会”今天结束。会议强调，从当前的形势来看，加强理论工作，提高理论水平，对于我党来说，具有特别重要的意义。要运用马克思主义基本原理，研究新情况，回答新问题。
    会议指出，这些年来，由于党的个别领导人在指导思想上的失误，使资产阶级自由化的谬论泛滥成灾，在思想上和理论上造成了混乱。因此，必须用马克思主义理论廓清种种迷雾，正本清源，以提高和统一全党和全国人民的思想。
    会议认为，在当前的国内外形势下，许多新情况需要研究，许多新问题需要回答。实践比任何时候更加需要理论，更加呼唤理论。联系当前的实际，研究、坚持、发展马克思主义，这是历史赋予中国共产党和中国的马克思主义者的光荣任务。
    在为期二天的会上，中央党校常务副校长薛驹和副校长邢贲思分别讲了话。他们指出，中央党校作为党中央直属的以培养高中级干部为目标的教育单位，应当在运用马克思主义原理，研究新情况、回答新问题方面作出贡献，应当把大量的研究成果运用到教育中去，用创造性的马克思主义武装我们的高中级干部，使他们在严峻的国内外形势下，能够认清大势，坚定信念，掌握武器，提高自己的政治理论素质，为加强和改善党的领导，为把有中国特色的社会主义建设事业推向前进，为在国际共产主义运动中完成我党的光荣使命作出贡献。
