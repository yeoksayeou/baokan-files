Since the founding of the People's Republic, for a considerable period, we have neglected the construction of historiography theory. Often, intentionally or unintentionally, we equated historiography theory with the theory of historical materialism, assuming that with historical materialism theory, there was no need for an independent historiography theory. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. Historical materialism theory is an important component of Marxist philosophy, while historiography theory pertains to the general laws and methods of historiography. The two are closely related but distinct; put simply, it is the relationship between the general and the specific. Every discipline has its own theoretical system, and historiography is no exception.

It must be acknowledged that historiography theory has long been a weak link in Chinese historiography. After the Cultural Revolution, this situation gradually began to change, with an increasing number of research papers in this area. Many historiographers have shifted their focus to this domain. It can be said that the discussion of historiography theory in China is burgeoning and has a broad development prospect.

Recently, the Hubei People's Publishing House published "Modern People and the Modern Interpretation of History" by Li Guihai. This book is a specialized work on historiography theory. The author states in the "Afterword" that the book aims to "break free from some of the constraints of historiography theory textbooks, both in terms of framework and specific discussions, to explore some new approaches. The focus of the exploration is on how to modernize historiography theory, which is also a topic of general concern in the historiography community." This is undoubtedly a valuable attempt.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "Today's China is a development of historical China; we are historical materialists, and we should not sever history." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 2, page 522) This book pays full attention to the relationship between history and reality. In the "Preface," it emphasizes that "reality is a continuation of history," and "many real-life issues can be traced back to their developmental context in history, and from history, we can find ways to understand reality. This is where the enduring vitality of historiography lies." However, history has become the past, "to turn dead history into something alive and relevant to real life, it depends on the work of historians. Without historians' research and interpretation of history, history remains history, and it will not participate in real-life activities." While historians study and interpret history, they cannot escape the influence of reality and are constrained by it. The author believes that the objective nature of history and the modern interpretation of history by historians is the main contradiction in historical research. "Historians find the basis for the role of history at this point of contradiction." Emphasizing the connection between history and reality, and stressing the real-life interpretation of history by historians and its social impact, can be said to be the main theme of this book. This work is developed around this theme. In analyzing the aforementioned contradiction, the author emphasizes the need to adhere to historical materialism and oppose historical idealism, with the key being to uphold the principle of historical objectivity, which is very important.

This monograph is divided into five chapters: Chapter 1, "Structure and Function"; Chapter 2, "Research Categories"; Chapter 3, "Analytical Methods"; Chapter 4, "Historical Evaluation"; Chapter 5, "Knowledge Structure." Such a structural arrangement gives us every reason to believe that the monograph's focus is on the discussion of the epistemology of history. The epistemology of history, like other human cognitive activities, is a reflection of the subject on the object. The focus of all cognitive activities, including historical cognition, lies in the relationship between the cognitive subject and the cognitive object. The fifth chapter, "Knowledge Structure," discusses how historians can improve their cognitive abilities. The first chapter, "Structure and Function," discusses the structural characteristics of the cognitive object, i.e., human society. The second, third, and fourth chapters study the forms and methods of historical cognition (in a broad sense, it is also about how to improve cognitive abilities). The structure of the book forms a relatively rigorous system of historical epistemology. The book's focus on the discussion of historical epistemology is consistent with the aforementioned theme of the book, because in the author's view, the modern interpretation of history "is a necessary result of historical epistemology." Or it can be said that only by solving the relevant problems of historical epistemology can one truly achieve a modern interpretation of history that meets the requirements of historical materialism.

The Chinese historiography community began to pay attention to the study of historical epistemology in the mid-1980s. Some scholars divide the theoretical system of historiography mainly into ontology, epistemology, and methodology. I agree with this view. In the past, we focused on ontology, while paying less attention to the other two aspects. Starting in the 1980s, especially from the mid-1980s, research in these two areas began to attract attention, with articles and books appearing successively. This trend reflects the progress of Chinese historiography theory. This book can be said to be the first monograph to focus on historical epistemology.

The main content of historical epistemology research is the forms, characteristics, and laws of historical cognitive activities. Historical cognition has both similarities and differences with other cognitive activities. The development of human society history is a natural process that does not change with people's will, and its content is extremely complex. Cognition can be divided into direct and indirect types. Generally speaking, historical cognition is indirect. In the process of historical cognition, historiographers are the cognitive subjects, and the historical process of society is the cognitive object. Between this pair of subject and object, there is no direct connection (of course, there are exceptions), and it must be mediated through historical materials. The extreme complexity of social history and the indirectness of historical cognition make historical cognition more difficult than other types of cognition. The cognitive object of historical cognition does not change, because human society history is an objective existence that has already passed. The cognitive subject, however, is constantly changing, because the cognitive abilities of historiographers will improve with the passage of time, scientific progress, changing concepts, and so on.

Therefore, improving the cognitive abilities of historiographers is of great importance to historical research. The main ways to improve cognitive abilities are twofold. First, continuously improving the knowledge structure of historiographers, primarily by enhancing Marxist education, and secondly, by broadening their knowledge base, and so on. Second, seriously exploring the methods and processes of historical cognition, making them increasingly scientific. These are urgent problems that need to be solved in historical epistemology research. The book has made valuable efforts in these aspects.

    史学理论探讨的新收获
    ——读《现代人与历史的现代解释》
    陈高华
    建国以来，在相当长的一段时间内，我们忽略了史学理论的建设，常常有意无意地把史学理论与历史唯物主义理论完全等同起来，以为有了历史唯物主义理论就不再需要独立的史学理论了。其实这是一种误解。历史唯物主义理论是马克思主义哲学的重要组成部分，而史学理论则是关于历史学的一般规律和方法，两者有密切的联系，但又有区别，说得简单一些，就是一般与个别的关系。每个学科都有自己的理论体系，历史学也不例外。
    应该承认，史学理论一直是我国历史学中的薄弱环节。“文化大革命”以后，这种情况逐渐有所改变，这方面的研究论文不断增多，不少史学工作者把注意力转移到这个领域中来。完全可以说，史学理论的探讨在我国历史学界方兴未艾，有着广阔的发展前景。
    湖北人民出版社最近出版了李桂海同志的《现代人与历史的现代解释》，就是一本关于史学理论的专门著作。作者在书的《后记》中说，这本书“是想摆脱史学理论教材的某些局限，从框架结构到具体的论述上都想做一些新的探索。探索的重点是史学理论如何现代化，这也是史学界目前普遍关心的一个问题。”这无疑是很有价值的尝试。
    毛泽东同志说过，“今天的中国是历史的中国的一个发展；我们是马克思主义的历史主义者，我们不应当割断历史。”（《毛泽东选集》第2卷，522页）本书充分注意到历史与现实的关系，《前言》中强调指出，“现实是历史的延续”，“很多现实问题可以从历史中找到它的发展脉络，从历史中找到认识现实的途径。这正是史学永远具有生命力之所在。”但是，历史已经成为过去，“把死的历史变成与现实生活有关系的活的东西，就要依赖历史学家的工作。……没有历史学家对历史的研究和解释，历史永远是历史，它不会参与现实的活动。”而历史学家研究和解释历史，又摆脱不开现实的影响，受现实的制约。作者认为，历史的客观性和历史学家对历史解释的现代性，这是历史研究中的主要矛盾，“历史学家正是在这一矛盾的结合点上，找到了发挥历史作用的基点。”重视历史与现实的联系，强调历史学家对历史的现实解释及其带来的社会影响，可以说是贯穿本书的主旨。这部著作，正是围绕着这一主旨展开的。在分析上述矛盾时作者强调指出必须坚持历史唯物主义，反对历史唯心主义，其关键在于坚持历史客观性的原则，强调这一点是非常重要的。
    这本专著共分五章，第一章“结构与功能”，第二章“研究范畴”，第三章“分析方法”，第四章“历史评价”，第五章“知识结构”。这样的结构安排使我们完全有理由认为，专著的重点在于对历史认识论进行探讨。历史认识和人类的其他认识活动一样，都是主体对客体的反映。包括历史认识在内的一切认识活动，其探讨的重点，都在于认识主体与认识客体之间的关系。本书的第五章“知识结构”，讨论的是历史认识主体，即历史研究工作者如何提高自己认识能力的问题。而第一章“结构与功能”，则是讨论历史认识客体即人类社会的结构特点。本书的第二、三、四章，研究的是历史认识的形式和方法（从广义上说，也是如何提高认识能力的问题）。本书的结构，形成了相当严密的历史认识论体系。本书把重点用于探讨历史认识论和上面所说书的主旨是完全一致的，因为在作者看来，对历史的现代解释，“是历史认识论的必然结果。”或者可以说，只有解决好历史认识论的各有关问题，才能真正做到符合历史唯物主义要求的对历史的现代解释。
    我国史学界重视历史认识论的研究，实际上是从八十年代中期开始的。有的同志把历史学的理论体系主要分为本体论、认识论和方法论三个部分，我是同意这种看法的。过去我们把注意力集中在本体论上，对于其余两个部分比较忽视。到了八十年代，特别是八十年代中期起，这两个方面的研究开始引起了注意，文章和著作相继出现。这种趋势，反映了我国史学理论的进步。而以历史认识论为重点研究对象的专著，则可以说本书是第一部。
    历史认识论研究的主要内容，是历史认识活动的形式、特点和规律等方面的问题。历史认识既有与其他认识活动的相同点，又有不同点。人类社会历史的发展是一个不依人们意志为转移的自然进程，其内容是极其复杂的。认识有间接与直接之分，历史认识就一般而言，都是间接的认识。在历史认识过程中，史学工作者是认识的主体，社会历史进程是认识的客体，在这一对主客体之间，并没有直接的联系（当然也有例外），必须通过中介体，即历史资料。社会历史的极其复杂性和历史认识的间接性，使得历史认识比起其他认识来，有其特殊的难度。历史认识的客体是不会变化的，因为人类社会历史是已经过去了的客观存在。历史认识的主体则是在不断变化之中的，因为史学工作者的认识能力会因时代变迁、科学的进步、观念的改变等等而不断有所提高。
    因此，提高史学工作者认识能力对历史研究工作来说，具有极其重要的意义。而提高认识能力的途径，主要有二。一是不断改善史学工作者的知识结构，首先是提高马克思主义的修养，其次是扩大知识面，等等。二是认真探索历史认识的方法和过程，使之逐步科学化。这些都是历史认识论研究中急待解决的问题。本书在上述各方面都作出了可贵的努力。
