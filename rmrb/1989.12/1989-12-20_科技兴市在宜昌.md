In recent years, those who have visited Yichang have noticed that the city's planning and layout of factories, residences, and transportation are relatively reasonable, and people's lives are relatively comfortable.

Leaders of Hubei Province told the reporter that in the current economic downturn, Yichang City is relatively better off, all thanks to the emphasis on scientific and technological progress over the years and the recent focus on revitalizing the city through science and technology.

The Concept of Science and Technology Revitalizing the City

Yichang City, through an analysis of many enterprises, found that approximately one-third of the enterprises attach great importance to science and technology, and their output value has increased by 2.5 times in five years; another one-third of the enterprises focus solely on production and do not pay enough attention to the technological factors in production and operation, with their output value growth rate being only 25% of the city's average growth rate; the remaining one-third of the enterprises, due to their conservative attitudes, have seen their output value decrease by 35% in five years.

These three one-thirds of the results deeply moved the city leaders: For a city like Yichang, with only 400,000 people, a small area (excluding counties), backward technology, weak economic foundation, and insufficient external investment, to achieve economic revitalization and coordinated economic and social development, it must rely on science and technology, take the road of developing productive forces mainly through internal improvements, and there is no other way. They clearly proposed that "to grasp industrial production, one must start from the foundation of scientific and technological progress."

In February 1987, some scientific and technological personnel in Yichang City proposed the strategy of revitalizing the city through science and technology.

The municipal party committee and government believed that if a city does not have a relatively high economic and technological quality, a relatively high resource conversion efficiency, and an economic benefit higher than the national average, it will not only be unable to play the role of a central city's centripetal and radiative force but will also be at a disadvantage in the competition among cities and regions. The municipal government quickly adopted this suggestion.

Practice of Science and Technology Revitalizing the City

In actual work, science and technology often do not align with the economy. For many years, the city has insisted that the deputy secretary in charge of science and technology also be responsible for the economy; the deputy mayor in charge of the economy also be responsible for science and technology. This effectively promotes the integration of science and technology with the economy from the leadership mechanism.

They have successively formulated more than ten policy documents encouraging scientific and technological progress, such as the "Implementation Award for Scientific and Technological Progress," and have implemented policies that favor scientific and technological progress in terms of organizational setup, operational mechanisms, and the allocation of production factors, thus creating a relatively good soft environment for the implementation of this strategy.

—They insist on placing the foundation of revitalizing the city through science and technology on revitalizing enterprises through science and technology, focusing on helping key enterprises formulate scientific and technological progress plans, and including enterprise scientific and technological progress indicators in enterprise contract responsibility systems. Through increasing scientific and technological loans, using most of the enterprise's retained profits for scientific and technological progress, and other channels, they expand the enterprise's scientific and technological investment. In recent years, the funds used by municipal enterprises for technological transformation have been around one billion yuan per year, enhancing the enterprises' long-term strength.

—They insist on taking the cultivation of talents and the improvement of workers' quality as the core of revitalizing the city through science and technology. In the past 10 years, the city has established more than 20 colleges and universities, including Yichang University, and vocational and technical education and adult education have also developed rapidly. All enterprises in the city ensure that new employees undergo training before going on the job, and on-the-job employees undergo training in rotation.

The Eighth of August Steel Plant, with only over 2,000 employees, has spent over 600,000 yuan on employee education in the past three years. The entire plant has systematically conducted technical and business training for all employees and has provided supplementary higher education for over 230 key personnel.

With the improvement of workers' quality, the plant's products have obtained the "International Standard Inspection Certificate," and many indicators rank among the top in dozens of local steel enterprises nationwide.

Initial Harvests of Science and Technology Revitalizing the City

Science and technology revitalizing the city have brought about significant changes to Yichang:

The city's strength has been enhanced. This year, the city's total industrial output value has increased by 4.2 times compared to 1978. In 1988, the labor productivity of state-owned enterprises reached over 31,000 yuan, doubling that of 10 years ago. In the past 10 years, more than 500 key technological transformations have been carried out for over 100 major industrial enterprises, upgrading the technological equipment and process levels, resulting in a qualitative change in product production. In recent years, the city has developed over 1,400 new products and tens of thousands of new varieties, creating 290 high-quality branded products. Among them, 22 products fill domestic gaps, and over 90 products are exported to nearly 100 countries and regions.

The city's economic and technological quality is gradually improving. This year, despite the sluggish market sales and intense competition, the proportion of the city's industrial products that are selling well and in stable demand remains at 80%.

The quality of enterprises has significantly improved, with the city currently having created 10 national second-level enterprises. The proportion of scientific and technological progress in economic growth factors has reached 40%. The overall scientific and technological quality of workers and the reserve workforce has universally improved. By 1988, scientific and technological personnel accounted for 12% of the city's workforce, and workers with a high school education or above accounted for 45.7%, with the proportion of illiterates and semi-illiterates being less than 1%.

—Due to the emphasis on scientific and technological progress and education, the city's spiritual civilization construction has also been further strengthened. Here, a good city atmosphere of respecting knowledge, respecting talents, and respecting science is being formed.

### 科技兴市在宜昌

    科技兴市在宜昌
    本报记者　王友恭
    近年来到过宜昌的同志都会感到，这个城市的工厂、住宅、交通等方面的规划布局比较合理，人们生活比较舒适。
    湖北省的领导告诉记者，在当前经济滑坡的情况下，宜昌市的日子相对好过，这都得益于多年来抓科技进步、近年来抓科技兴市。科技兴市战略
    思想的提出
    宜昌市在对众多企业状况的剖析中发现，大约有1／3的企业比较重视科技，5年内产值增长了2.5倍；1／3的企业就生产抓生产，对生产经营中的科技因素重视不够，产值增长速度仅为全市平均增长幅度的25％；还有1／3的企业由于因循守旧，5年内产值反而下降了35％。
    这三个1／3的结论深深地触动了市领导：像宜昌这样一个只有40万人口、地域狭小（不含县）、技术落后、经济基础薄弱、外部投资不足的中等城市，要实现经济振兴和经济、社会的协调发展，只有紧紧依靠科学技术，走以内涵为主发展生产力的道路，舍此别无他路。他们明确提出“抓工业生产必须从科技进步基础工作抓起。”
    1987年2月，宜昌市部分科技人员提出了科技兴市的战略。
    市委、市政府认为，一个城市如果没有较高的经济技术素质，没有较高的资源转化效率，没有高于全国平均水平的经济效益，不仅无法发挥中心城市的向心力和辐射作用，在城市和区域的竞争中也会陷于被动。市政府很快采纳了这一建议。科技兴市的实践
    科技和经济在实际工作中往往脱节。多年来该市坚持抓科技的副书记同时也负责抓经济；抓经济的副市长也负责抓科技。这就从领导机制上有效地促进了科技与经济的结合。
    他们先后制定了“科技进步实施奖”等十几个鼓励科技进步的政策文件，从机构设置、体制运行、生产要素配置上实行了有利于科技进步的政策倾斜，从而为这一战略的实施创造了一个较好的软环境。
    ——坚持把科技兴市的基点放到科技兴厂上，重点帮助骨干企业制定科技进步规划，把企业科技进步的指标纳入企业承包合同。通过增加科技贷款、把企业大部分留利用于科技进步等多种渠道来扩大企业的科技投入。近几年来，市管企业用于技术改造的资金每年都在亿元左右，使企业增强了后劲。
    ——坚持把培养人才和提高劳动者素质作为科技兴市的核心来抓。近10年来，该市先后办起宜昌大学等大中专院校20多所，职业技术教育和成人教育也有了较快的发展。全市企业做到新职工先培训后上岗，在岗的职工轮流培训。
    只有2000多名职工的八一钢厂，近3年用于职工教育的经费就达60多万元。全厂职工系统地进行了技术业务轮训，还为230多名骨干补上大中专学历教育。
    随着职工素质的提高，该厂产品取得了“国际标准验收合格证”，多项指标在全国数十家地方钢铁企业中名列前茅。科技兴市初步收获科技兴市给该市带来了明显的变化：
    城市实力有所增强。今年全市工业总产值比1978年增长了4.2倍。1988年全民所有制企业劳动生产率达到3.1万多元，比10年前增长了2倍。近10年来对100多个主要工业企业有计划地进行了500多项重点技术改造，技术装备和工艺水平的升级换代，使产品生产出现了质的变化。近年来，全市先后开发出1400多种新产品和上万个新的花色品种，创制了290多种优质名牌产品，其中22种产品填补国内空白，90多个产品远销近百个国家和地区。
    城市经济技术素质逐步提高。今年以来，在市场销售疲软、竞争激烈的情况下，该市工业产品畅销和平销的比重仍达80％。
    企业素质明显提高，目前全市已创10个国家级二级企业。科技进步在经济增长因素中所占的比重已达40％。劳动者及后备军的整体科技素质普遍提高，到1988年，科技人员已占全市职工数的12％，职工中具有高中以上文化程度的占45.7％，文盲、半文盲的比重不到1％。
    ——由于重视科技进步、重视教育，整个城市的精神文明建设也得到了进一步加强。在这里，尊重知识、尊重人才、尊重科学的良好市风正在形成。
