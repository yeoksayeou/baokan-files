China has started the development of four major software bases. According to Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin on December 11, the Tianjin Zhonghuan Software Joint Company, which focuses on computer software development, was recently established in Tianjin, marking the beginning of China's development of four major software bases.

According to relevant personnel from the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, China currently has approximately 300,000 microcomputers, over 1,000 minicomputers, and more than 100 mainframe computers. Due to insufficient software development, nearly one-third of the computers in the country are idle. Additionally, a significant portion of the computers are only used for low-efficiency tasks such as payroll, personnel files, financial management, and warehouse management.

To reduce waste, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics has formulated preferential policies such as low-interest loans, tax exemptions, and allowing partial tax-deductible repayments. It has decided to start the development and construction of software bases in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai from this year onwards.

    我国着手开发四大软件基地
    据新华社天津12月11日电　（记者马魁君）以计算机软件开发为主的天津中环软件联合公司日前在天津成立，从而拉开了我国开发四大软件基地的序幕。
    据机电部有关人士透露，我国目前大约已有30万台微型计算机，1000多台小型计算机和上百台大型计算机。由于软件开发不足，国内有近1／3的计算机处于闲置状态，此外，还有相当一部分处于仅仅被用于工资、人事档案、财务、仓库管理等低效益使用阶段。
    为了减少浪费，机电部制订了低息贷款、减免关税、允许部分税前还贷等优惠政策，决定从今年起，着手在北京、天津、南京、上海等四大城市开发建设软件基地。
