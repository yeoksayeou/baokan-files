To better organize the supply and sales of materials in accordance with the state's industrial policies, the Ministry of Materials recently issued the "Implementation Measures for the Ministry of Materials to Carry Out the State's Current Industrial Policies."

The "Measures" require the materials sector to rationally allocate material resources in line with industrial policies, vigorously support agricultural production and the production of light textile products and export-oriented products that are in demand, and prioritize meeting the needs of key national production and construction projects and scientific research tasks in the energy, transportation, telecommunications, national defense and military industries, geological exploration, and short-supply raw materials. Special attention should be given to meeting the needs of large and medium-sized backbone enterprises designated by the state. For industries and products that the state's industrial policies require to be restricted or stopped, the supply of various materials should be strictly restricted or stopped.

Materials allocated through state mandatory plans should prioritize ensuring the main raw materials, fuels, and key equipment needed for state mandatory plan tasks and state-upgraded products, ensuring the materials needed for key national construction projects organized according to reasonable construction periods, and supporting agricultural production, agricultural machinery, and market-scarce light textile products, export aid, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief needs. Materials organized by the materials sector should primarily be used to make up for the shortfalls in planned allocations. Important materials entering the production materials market, such as steel, copper, coal, timber, automobiles, and polyethylene, should be sold with a bias.

According to state requirements, relevant departments and production enterprises should prioritize the overall interests, firmly ensure the implementation of state allocation plans and the completion of procurement contracts, and enterprises that have not completed state allocation plans and state procurement contracts are not allowed to sell independently.

For imported materials, the "Measures" stipulate that they should primarily be used for introducing production technology and equipment, key components, and domestically scarce important raw materials.

    按产业政策组织物资供应销售
    物资部颁布具体办法
    据新华社北京12月3日电　为了更好地按国家产业政策要求组织物资供应和销售，物资部近日颁发了《物资部门贯彻国家当前产业政策实施办法》。
    《办法》要求物资部门按照产业政策合理配置物资资源，大力支持农业和适销对路的轻纺产品和出口创汇产品的生产，优先满足能源、交通、邮电、国防军工、短线原材料、地质勘探等行业的国家重点生产建设和科研任务的需要，特别要优先满足国家大中型骨干企业的需要。对国家产业政策要求限制和停止生产的产业和产品生产，都应严格限制或停止各类物资的供应。
    国家指令性计划分配物资，要优先保证国家指令性计划任务和国家上调产品所需的主要原材料、燃料和重要装备，保证按合理工期组织建设的国家重点建设项目所需的物资，支持农业、农用工业和市场紧俏的轻纺产品生产、出口援外、扶贫救灾的需要。物资部门自行组织的物资，主要应用于弥补计划分配不足。进入生产资料市场交易的重要物资，如钢材、铜、煤炭、木材、汽车、聚乙烯等要实行倾斜销售。
    按国家要求，各有关主管部门和生产企业要从全局利益出发，坚决保证国家分配计划的落实和订货合同的完成，企业没有完成国家调拨计划和国家订货合同的，不准自销。
    对于进口物资，《办法》规定主要安排引进生产技术装备、关键零部件及国内紧缺的重要原材料。
