Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th.

The 11th session of the Standing Committee of the 7th National People's Congress was held this morning and afternoon, with several deputies and attendees discussing issues such as education, legal system construction, military facility protection, agriculture, environmental protection, and urban planning.

Million Li, the Chairman, and Ye Fei, the Vice Chairman, presided over the morning and afternoon sessions, respectively.

Deputy Zhang Tao spoke, suggesting that existing laws should be reviewed with a focus on key areas. The experiences and lessons from law enforcement should be summarized to make legislation more perfect, ensuring that the principles of "rule of law" and "strict enforcement of the law" are better implemented, promoting a healthier development of China's legal system.

Deputy He Mianfen believed that improving urban planning requires streamlining the urban management system and enhancing the authority of urban planning administrative departments to facilitate the implementation of the Urban Planning Law. She stated that urban planning management must be unified and highly centralized. Urban planning should ensure rational layout, rational land use, comprehensive consideration, and coordinated development.

Deputies Duan Suquan and Huang Yunkun (representing Yan Jinsheng) discussed issues related to the Military Facilities Protection Law. Deputy Duan Suquan believed that economic strength is the foundation of national defense, and strengthening national defense and protecting the motherland is a necessary condition for economic construction. Conflicts between economic development, opening up to tourism, and protecting military facilities should be considered comprehensively, balancing short-term and long-term interests, and resolving them appropriately. Deputies Huang Yunkun and Yan Jinsheng suggested that the promulgation and implementation of this law should be widely publicized and educated nationwide to enhance people's national defense awareness and strengthen national defense consciousness. They pointed out that protecting military facilities and strengthening national defense is not just the responsibility of a few, but a shared responsibility and duty of the entire Party, the military, and all ethnic groups in the country.

Deputies Li Gui, Wang Jinling, Deng Jiatai, Zhang Chengxian, Chen Shuli (representing Chu Zhuang), Yang Lieyu, and Wu Zhonghua discussed educational issues. They believed that the prominent problem in education is that the series of educational policies proposed by the Party Central Committee have not been well implemented. Party leadership and political ideological work are weak, and the four cardinal principles have not been consistently upheld. There is a lack of emphasis on cultivating the ideological and moral character of young students, and management is lax and discipline is scattered. They believed that the fundamental issue in education is who to cultivate. Socialist universities should be places to cultivate socially aware, scientifically and culturally educated, reliable successors of socialism. In educational issues, it is necessary to clearly recognize the seriousness of the struggle between domestic and foreign hostile forces for the younger generation. It is necessary to combine teaching with educating people, teaching students why they should support the leadership of the Communist Party and why they should follow the socialist path. Maintain a firm political direction, love the country, and love socialism.

Deputies Yang Jike and Zhang Gensheng discussed the protection of agricultural environments and how to break through the stagnation in agriculture. Deputy Yang Jike believed that due to the large-scale discharge of industrial "three wastes" and the irrational development and utilization of natural resources, the pollution and ecological damage of China's agricultural environment are already quite serious, posing certain hazards to agricultural production and public health. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a comprehensive regulation specifically for the protection of agricultural environments to complement the environmental protection law primarily aimed at controlling urban pollution. Zhang Gensheng believed that to break through the stagnation in agriculture, the first step is to establish a strategic coordination between industry and agriculture, improve agricultural comprehensive productivity, vigorously develop science and technology, stabilize the household contract responsibility system, improve the dual management system, and establish a socialized service system for agricultural production. Gradually implement the process of agricultural modernization.

Deputy Liu Dongsheng, on behalf of Deputy Ye Duzheng and Sun Honglie, made a joint speech on environmental protection issues. They pointed out that the comprehensive development, utilization, governance, and protection of resources and the environment are cross-departmental and cross-regional comprehensive issues. Many measures cannot be solved by a single department or region and must be uniformly planned, arranged, and managed by the state.

Deputy Ma Wanqi believed that an important task for China at present is to maintain national stability and unity and vigorously develop the economy. Only with a stable situation can economic construction be carried out, and only by improving the economy can people's hearts be stabilized and other things be done well. To accomplish these two major tasks, the whole country must work together and eliminate all obstacles.

Deputy Mamutufu Kurban believed that developing ethnic education is an important task of China's education cause. Due to the care and attention of the Party and the state, many effective policies and measures have been taken, making the ethnic education cause, like the national education cause, achieve unprecedented historical development, and initially establishing a distinctive ethnic education system. He believed that developing ethnic education must adhere to the socialist direction, cultivate people who uphold the four cardinal principles, clearly maintain national unity, cultivate excellent young people who love the country, are loyal to the Party and socialism, and cultivate a new generation of people who have socialist awareness, discipline, and culture, and are determined to fight against domestic and foreign separatist forces.

Deputy Wu Dakun introduced his recent observations from a trip to Guangzhou and Shenzhen.

    人大常委会进行大会讨论
    委员们就教育法制建设军事设施保护等发表意见
    新华社北京12月26日电　七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议今天上午和下午进行了大会讨论，十几位委员和列席会议的同志就教育问题、法制建设、军事设施保护、农业问题、环境保护和城市规划等问题发表了意见。
    万里委员长、叶飞副委员长分别主持了上、下午的大会讨论。
    曾涛委员发言认为，应该对已经颁布的法律，进行有重点的调查，把执法的经验教训加以总结，从而使立法更完善，使有法必依，执法必严的原则得到更好的贯彻执行，使我国的法制化进程更健康地发展。
    何浣芬委员认为，搞好城市规划首先要理顺城市管理体制，提高城市规划行政主管部门的权威性，以利城市规划法的执行。她说，城市规划管理必须统一领导，高度集中。城市规划的制定要保证合理布局，合理用地，综合考虑，协调发展。
    段苏权、黄玉昆（代表颜金生）等委员就军事设施保护法的有关问题发表了意见。段苏权委员认为，经济力量是国防实力的基础，巩固国防、保卫祖国是经济建设的必要条件。对经济建设、开放旅游与保护军事设施的矛盾，要全面考虑，统筹兼顾，把当前的利益和长远的利益相结合，妥善地加以解决。黄玉昆、颜金生等委员建议，通过这个法的颁布实施，在全国进行一次广泛的宣传教育，提高人们的国防观念，增强国防意识。他们指出，保护军事设施，加强国防建设，决不是某一部分人的事情，而是全党、全军、全国各族人民的共同责任和应尽的义务。
    李贵、王金陵、邓家泰、张承先、陈舜礼（代表楚庄）、杨烈宇、吴仲华等委员就教育问题发表了意见。他们认为，教育方面突出的问题是党中央提出的一系列教育方针没有很好地得到贯彻落实，党的领导和政治思想工作相当薄弱，没有始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，对青年学生思想品德的培养重视不够，管理松懈、纪律涣散等等。他们认为，培养什么样的人的问题，始终是教育战线的根本问题。社会主义的大学应当是培养有社会主义觉悟的有科学文化的社会主义可靠接班人的场所。在教育问题上，应清醒地认识到国内外敌对势力和我们激烈地争夺青年一代的严重性。要把教书和育人结合起来，教育学生懂得为什么要拥护共产党的领导，为什么要走社会主义道路。坚持坚定的政治方向，爱祖国、爱社会主义。
    杨纪珂委员、张根生同志分别就农业环境的保护问题和如何突破农业徘徊的局面问题发表了看法。杨纪珂认为，由于有害工业“三废”的大量排放，以及对自然资源不合理的开发利用，我国农业环境污染及生态破坏的情况已经相当严重，已对农业生产和人民健康造成一定程度的危害。因此，有必要针对农业环境保护的特殊要求，制定一个主要为全面而具体地保护农业环境而立的综合性法规，以与主要为控制城市排污而立的环保法相配合。张根生认为，要突破农业徘徊的局面，首要的是建立工业、农业协调发展的战略，同时，提高农业综合生产力；大力发展科学技术；稳定家庭联产承包责任制，完善双层经营，建立农业生产的社会化服务体系；逐步实行农业现代化的过程。
    刘东生委员代表叶笃正委员、孙鸿烈代表就环境保护问题做了联合发言。他们指出，资源与环境的综合开发、利用、治理、保护是跨部门、跨地区的综合性问题，很多措施不是由某一部门或某一地区能够解决的，必须由国家统一规划、统一安排、统一管理。
    马万祺委员在发言中认为，我国当前很重要的任务是要保持国家的安定团结和大力发展经济。只有局面稳定，才能进行经济建设，只有把经济搞好才能安定人心、才能把其他事情办好。要完成这两大任务，必须全国上下同心同德，排除一切障碍。
    马木托夫·库尔班委员认为，发展民族教育是我国教育事业的重要任务之一。由于党和国家的关怀和重视，采取了许多有效的政策和措施，使少数民族教育事业同全国教育事业一样取得了前所未有的历史性发展，初步建立了具有一定特色的民族教育体系。他认为，发展民族教育，必须坚持社会主义方向，培养坚持四项基本原则、旗帜鲜明地维护祖国统一的人，培养那些坚持民族团结，热爱祖国、忠于党、忠于社会主义的优秀青年，培养那些坚决同国内外分裂势力做斗争的、有社会主义觉悟、有纪律、有文化的一代新人。
    吴大琨委员在发言中介绍了他最近赴广州、深圳考察的见闻。
