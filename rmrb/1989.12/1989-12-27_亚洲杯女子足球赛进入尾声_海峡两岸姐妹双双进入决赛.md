In today's Asian Cup women's football semifinals, the Chinese team defeated Hong Kong 7-0, and the Chinese Taipei team defeated Japan 1-0. Both teams from across the Taiwan Strait have advanced to the finals.

This afternoon, the A group champion faced the B group runner-up, Hong Kong. The disparity in strength was significant. Hong Kong's ability to reach the semifinals had already exceeded expectations. Before the match, it was predicted that losing to the Chinese team was inevitable. Therefore, the team strategically focused on defense, retreating to the backcourt with a dense wall of players to guard, but they were no match for the stronger opponent. The Chinese team's key player Wu Wei Ying did not take the field, and Beijing's Zhang Yan showcased her skills. Ten minutes into the first half, she scored a goal with a direct shot. In this match, Zhang Yan scored 6 goals, with the remaining goal scored by Liu Ai Ling.

The match between the Chinese Taipei team and the Japanese team was not one-sided. Both teams were closely matched, and the competition was intense. The Japanese team had scored 28 goals in the group stage of this Asian Cup, and due to the weakness of the B group, they entered the semifinals undefeated. Today, facing the Chinese Taipei team, they faced a true test. At the 11-minute mark of the first half, Taipei's star player Zhou Tai Ying received a pass from a teammate on the left side of the penalty area and quickly shot the ball into the net, securing the winning goal. The subsequent intense competition did not result in any more goals. Known as the "God Leg" in Taiwan's sports scene, Zhou Tai Ying has gone to Japan to play professionally (for the Shimizu team). Taiwan specially called her back to win this tournament. Therefore, the Shimizu team members in the Japanese lineup are Zhou Tai Ying's "teammates" and have some understanding of Taipei's playing style, but the absence of the Japanese team's captain Takara Yachiko due to a knee injury affected their strength.

The final match for the Asian Cup championship will be held on the evening of the 29th. After losing to the mainland team in their first match, the Taipei team had expressed that they "lost with a willing heart and mouth." Now that both teams have advanced to the finals, they will compete again to determine the winner. Taipei's coach Xiao Yong Fu expressed "great confidence" in a comeback, anticipating a fierce battle.

    亚洲杯女子足球赛进入尾声
    海峡两岸姐妹双双进入决赛
    本报香港12月26日电　（记者连锦添）在今日进行的亚洲杯女足半决赛中，中国队以7∶0轻取香港队，中国台北队以1∶0战胜日本队，两岸女子足球队双双进入决赛。
    今天下午，A组冠军对B组亚军香港队，实力比较悬殊。香港队能打入四强，已达预期目的，赛前预测对中国队输球是不可避免。所以该队在战略上刻意防守，全力退居后场以密集人墙固守，但面对强手防不胜防。中国队主力吴伟英未派上场，北京姑娘张岩大显身手。上半场开局十分钟时她单刀直入踢进一球。此役张岩共攻进6个球，其余一球为刘爱玲射进。
    中国台北队与日本队之战则不是一面倒，双方实力接近，争夺你死我活。日本队在本届亚洲杯小组赛中曾攻进28个球，由于B组较弱，日本队以全胜姿态进入准决赛，今天面对中国台北队才受到真正考验。上半场到11分钟时，台北队名将周台英在禁区左侧接过队友传球，迅即抽射入网得手，奠定致胜基础。随后，双方激烈角逐均未再破门。在台湾体坛被称为“神腿”的周台英，已到日本打职业队（清水队）。台湾为赢得这届比赛特地召她回来。因此日本队阵中的清水队员与周台英是“队友”，对台北队的球路有一定了解，但日本队主将高仓麻子膝伤缺阵，实力受到影响。
    本届亚洲杯冠亚军决赛将于29日晚上举行。台北队首战败给大陆队后曾表示“输得心服口服”。如今双双进入决赛，再分高下。台北队教练萧永福表示“颇有信心”，卷土重来，预料有一番好斗。
