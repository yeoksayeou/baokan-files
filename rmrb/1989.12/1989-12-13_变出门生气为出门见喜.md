    **Transforming Frustration into Joy When Going Out**

    People live in society and inevitably interact with all kinds of people. The type of interpersonal relationships we build is one of the indicators of a country's and a nation's level of civilization. Good interpersonal relationships can make people feel happy; otherwise, going out will bring worries, and dealing with matters will bring frustration, how can one be in high spirits?

    Today, we launch the "People and People" column. Its purpose is to promote social justice and strive to create a new type of interpersonal relationship unique to socialism, where people understand and accommodate each other, and live harmoniously. We hope that everyone starts with themselves, so that our society can always be warm and harmonious. — Editor

    The idea for this topic came from several personal experiences.

    One day after work, I took the No. 5 bus in Xi'an. I saw the ticket collector urging a young man to hurry up, but the man retorted with foul language: "Stinking ticket collector, what's so great about you!" An elderly man nearby couldn't stand it and said a few words, but the man hurled more filthy language at the old man, making the old man's hands tremble with anger.

    Another day, I took the No. 1 bus in Xi'an to Nan Xiaojie. An older woman wanted to get off the bus, but because she took a little longer to find her monthly pass, the ticket collector scolded her: "What are you dawdling for?" The woman's eyes welled up with tears.

    One day, my wife and I went to the North Street branch of the Xi'an New China Bookstore to buy books. As soon as we stepped into the open-shelf book area, we were scolded by three female clerks who were chatting there. My wife smiled and tried to explain, but one of the clerks cursed at her. I stepped forward to mediate, but two men from behind the counter came out and attacked me, leaving me with a bruised face. We went to the store's management, who said: "We will definitely deal with this seriously, please go home and wait for the result." Soon, Wang from the Xi'an New China Bookstore Security Department called to say: "The entire staff of the North Street branch have written statements saying that no one hit anyone, they only admit to having an argument with you." Finally, Wang said: "Were you perhaps injured on North Street while taking the bus, or were you hit by someone else? Did you come to the wrong place?" It seemed as if he was accusing me of "falsely accusing" someone. I just couldn't understand: why have some people lost even the most basic sense of morality? How have their sense of right and wrong and honor and shame been completely reversed?

    These days, people have three fears when going out: first, fear of things (many counterfeit and shoddy products, fear of being cheated); second, fear of incidents (difficult to get things done without connections); third, fear of people (some people with reasons jump to conclusions, without reasons argue endlessly). Whether men, women, old, or young, foul language can be heard anytime, anywhere. Those who start fighting after three words of disagreement can be seen on the streets at any time. It makes people go out with high spirits but come home with a belly full of anger.

    Society is made up of people. People need to survive, work, and go out to do things, which means they have to interact with others. How to get along with people and treat others is an art. If everyone can do their best to consider the bigger picture, understand the bigger issues, be civilized, and polite; respect others in public places, be kind and loving; not be petty over small matters or personal gains and losses, then why would going out bring frustration?

    "Going out to see joy" is a Chinese idiom. In the 1950s and early 1960s, people truly did "go out to see joy." At that time, going out was able to bring joy because there was indeed joy outside the door. The spirit of Lei Feng shone everywhere: "Comrade, hello!" "Sorry," "No problem," "Goodbye, take care" and other civilized words were like a warm spring breeze. How did the relationship between people change to become so tense today!

    I miss that beautiful era and also look forward to, through the construction of spiritual civilization, forming a new type of interpersonal relationship.

### 变出门生气为出门见喜

    变出门生气为出门见喜
    人生活在社会上，免不了同各种各样的人打交道。建立什么样的人际关系，是衡量一个国家、一个民族文明程度的标志之一。良好的人际关系，可以使人精神愉快；否则，出门见愁，办事生气，怎么能提起精神来呢？今天，我们推出“人与人”的栏目，目的是弘扬社会正气，努力造成一种社会主义所特有的人与人之间互相理解、互相谦让，和睦相处的新型的人际关系。希望大家都从自己做起，让我们的社会永远温馨、和谐。——编者
    想到这个题目，完全是因为我所亲身经历的几件事。
    某日下班后，在西安市乘5路电车，我看见售票员招呼一男青年快上车，谁知那人口出恶言：“臭卖票的有啥了不起！”一老者在旁看不下去，说了两句，那人又将脏言秽语向老者泼去，气得老人双手发抖。
    另一日，我乘西安1路电车行至南小巷。一上年纪的女同志要下车，因掏月票的动作慢了些，售票员劈头盖脸就是一句：“你他妈的，磨蹭啥哩！”那位女同胞委屈的眼泪在眼眶里打转转。
    一日我同爱人去西安市新华书店北大街门市部购书，刚踏进开架售书柜，即受到坐在那里聊天的3名女服务员的呵斥。妻子笑脸相辩，遭到一女服务员的指骂。我上前相劝，柜台另一端走出二男，前后夹攻，打得我鼻青脸肿。我们找到书店领导，答曰：一定严肃处理，让我们回家等结果。不久，西安市新华书店保卫科王同志打电话来说：北大街门市部全体人员写了书面证明，都说无人打人，只承认和我们发生争吵。最后，王同志说：“你是不是在北大街坐车时被撞伤了，或是被别的什么人打伤，找错地方了？”大有指责我“凭空诬赖”之意。我怎么也想不通：为什么现在有些人连最基本的道德观都丢失了？他们的是非观、荣辱观为何全被颠倒了？
    时下，人们出门有三怕：一是怕物（伪劣商品多、怕上当受骗）；二是怕事
  （没有关系事难办）；三是怕人（有人有理跳三丈、无理辩三分）。不论男女老少，污言秽语随时随处可闻，三句话不合便动手打人者，在大街上随时有所见。搞得人出门时兴高采烈，回到家来却憋着一肚子的气。
    社会是由人组成的。人要生存、要工作、要出门办事，就要与别人发生关系。为人处世、接人待物是门学问。如果人人能做到顾大局，识大体，讲文明，懂礼貌；在公共场所尊重他人，宽厚仁爱；在小事小非上，或个人得失上，不斤斤计较，那么何以会出门生气呢？
      “出门见喜”，是我们中国人的一句口头语。在50年代、60年代初，人们确实是
  “出门见喜”。那时出门之所以能“见喜”，是因为门外确实有“喜”，雷锋精神随处闪现：“同志您好！”“对不起”、“不要紧”、“再见，请走好”等文明语言如春风，给人以温暖。曾几何时，人与人之间的关系变成现在这样剑拔弩张！
    我怀念那个美好的时代，也盼望着通过精神文明建设，形成新型人际关系。
