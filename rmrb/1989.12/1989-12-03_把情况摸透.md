The investigation provided by Comrade Han Peixun contains a lot of figures, but it is far from dull. It reveals a series of shocking facts that should jolt us into awareness. It also gives us a lesson: to address a problem, one must first get to the bottom of the situation.

The general perception is that no one is encroaching on land. Others have more severe problems; many people still think there is land to cultivate, and that the land crisis is a future issue...

Is the situation really like this? If our discussions are not grounded in reality and merely engage in generalities, only talking about others and not ourselves, then the problem will be difficult to truly resolve. It is likely that everything will remain the same after the discussion, with no real change.

    把情况摸透
    韩培逊同志提供的这个调查，数字多一点，但并不枯燥。它把一系列惊人的事实披露出来了，促人猛醒。这又给我们以启示：弄清问题首先要把情况摸透。
    普遍存在的情况是：都说自己没有蚕食土地。人家的问题比自己严重；也有不少人觉得眼前还有地种，土地危机是将来的事……
    情况果真如此吗？我们的讨论假如不联系实际，仅仅泛泛而谈，只谈人家不讲自己，问题就难于真正解决，很可能是雨过地皮湿。
