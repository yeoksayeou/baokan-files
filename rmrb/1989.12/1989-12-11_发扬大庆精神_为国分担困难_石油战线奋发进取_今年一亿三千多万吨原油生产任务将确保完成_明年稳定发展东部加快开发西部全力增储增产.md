“When the country faces difficulties, we will share the burden.” The China National Petroleum Corporation, while ensuring the completion of 137.5 million tons of crude oil production this year, aims to strive for a new level of oil and gas production nationwide next year.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, China's petroleum industry has achieved remarkable results, but it has also encountered many difficulties. Currently, most of the main oil fields in the country that are in development are in the middle to late stages, making stable production and increased production increasingly challenging. The replacement of reserves is extremely tense, and production faces the situation of "high cost, low accumulation." At the same time, production and construction funds are severely lacking, forming a sharp contradiction with the realization of a steady increase in oil and gas production.

Leaders from various oil fields under the corporation believe that the difficulties faced by the petroleum industry are part of the nation's difficulties. China's petroleum industry has overcome numerous challenges to reach its current state. Although the difficulties today are significant, they are far less severe than during the Daqing Campaign era, when there were even issues of food shortages. Currently, crude oil and natural gas are the "short legs" in the national economy's development, and the country's modernization construction urgently needs them. The central government requires a steady increase in production. Leaders from various oil fields have expressed that they will look inward, tap into potential, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing Campaign, and mobilize and organize the broad masses of petroleum workers to advance despite the difficulties. They will ensure that oil and gas production only increases and does not decrease, actively sharing the nation's burdens and making more contributions.

It is understood that after gathering the opinions of leaders from various oil fields, the China National Petroleum Corporation has proposed several specific measures for the rectification and reorganization of the petroleum industry: Next year, the petroleum industry will first focus on stabilizing and developing the eastern region, striving for "increased reserves and increased production." This region includes nine oil areas such as Daqing, Shengli, Liahe, and Zhongyuan, which have good exploration, development, and production conditions, making it easy to quickly form production capacity. At the same time, efforts will be accelerated in the western region to strive for the discovery of large and super-large oil and gas fields. In particular, the Tarim Basin, which is predicted to have oil and natural gas resources accounting for 1/6 and 1/4 of the national oil and gas resources respectively, is considered one of the largest basins in the world that has not yet been fully explored. Starting next year, the corporation will dispatch elite forces from across the country to this region for extensive exploration and development. Additionally, the corporation has clearly stipulated that next year, new construction projects will be strictly controlled, and those already underway will be reviewed. Projects with poor economic benefits will be firmly halted or postponed. All units will not build new office buildings, and mining area construction investments will be reduced by 10% compared to this year. Efforts will be made to launch mass "double increase, double savings" activities, mobilize internal stock materials worth 500 million yuan, and save various types of energy equivalent to 100 million tons of standard coal across the industry. The corporation also calls on all employees to strive to increase production and savings, and increase income and savings by 1,000 yuan per person per year.

    发扬大庆精神  为国分担困难
    石油战线奋发进取
    今年一亿三千多万吨原油生产任务将确保完成
    明年稳定发展东部加快开发西部全力增储增产
    本报北京12月10日讯　记者张国荣报道：“国家有困难，我们来分担”。中国石油天然气总公司在今年确保完成1.375亿吨原油的基础上，明年力争全国油气生产上一个新台阶。
    改革开放10年来，我国石油工业成绩显著，但也遇到许多困难。目前全国已投入开发的主力油田，大多进入了中晚期，稳产和增产难度越来越大，后备资源接替十分紧张，生产上出现“高成本，低积累”状况。同时生产建设资金严重短缺，与实现油气产量持续稳定增长形成尖锐矛盾。
    总公司所属各油田领导干部认为，石油工业面临的困难，是国家困难的一部分，我国石油工业就是在不断克服困难中走过来的。现在困难再大，也比当年大庆会战时期要好得多，那时还有吃不饱饭的问题。现在原油天然气是国民经济发展中的“短腿”，国家四化建设急需它们，中央要求产量稳步增加。各油田负责同志表示，眼睛向内，挖掘潜力发扬当年大庆会战时的革命精神，发挥思想政治工作威力，动员和组织广大石油职工迎着困难前进，确保油气生产只能上，不能下，主动为国家多分担困难，多作贡献。
    据了解，中国石油天然气总公司集中各油田负责同志的意见后，提出了石油工业治理整顿的几项具体措施：明年石油工业生产首先是稳定发展东部地区，努力“增储增产”。这个地区包括大庆、胜利、辽河、中原等9个油区，勘探开发和生产的基础条件较好，易于很快形成生产能力。同时加快西部地区工作步伐，争取发现大型和特大型的油气田。尤其是塔里木盆地，预测的石油、天然气资源蕴藏量分别占全国油气资源蕴藏量的1／6和1／4，被称为迄今为止世界上尚未进行充分勘探的一个特大型盆地。从明年开始，总公司将从全国抽调精兵强将奔赴这个地区大力勘探开发。此外，总公司还明确规定，明年严格控制新开基建项目，已开工的重新进行清理，经济效益差的坚决停建或缓建；各单位一律不建楼堂馆所，矿区建设投资比今年削减10％，大力开展群众性的“双增双节”活动，动员内部库存物资5亿元，全行业节约各种能源100万吨标准煤，并号召广大职工，争取年均每人增产节约、增收节支1000元。
