The PLO issued a statement in Tunis on December 16, denying that "Fatah" leader Abu Maher had made any comments to the Associated Press regarding an attack on a Syrian intelligence center in southern Lebanon on December 14.

The statement said that after a thorough investigation with Abu Maher, it was confirmed that he had not made any statements to the Associated Press or any other news agency. It also stated that there were no Palestinians or Lebanese being held in the Syrian intelligence center in Sidon.

The statement accused the Associated Press of publishing false information and pointed out that such fabricated news could only lead to the shedding of innocent blood among Palestinians and Lebanese, and could only serve the interests of their common enemies.

    巴解批评美联社报道不真实
    巴解组织十六日在突尼斯发表一项公报，否认“法塔赫”领导人阿布·马海尔就叙利亚军队设在黎巴嫩南部的情报中心十四日遭到袭击一事向美联社发表谈话的消息。
    公报说，经过向阿布·马海尔进行详细调查后，现已证实，他没有向美联社或其他通讯社发表过任何谈话，设在西顿的叙利亚情报中心内也没有被关押的任何巴勒斯坦人或黎巴嫩人。
    公报指责美联社发表不真实的消息，并指出，这种虚伪消息只能导致无辜的巴勒斯坦人和黎巴嫩人流血，只能为他们的共同敌人的利益效劳。
