Our delegation, which came to participate in the talks on the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia, visited the "Asian-African Conference Memorial Hall" in Bandung this morning.

The "Asian-African Conference Memorial Hall," located in the center of Bandung, was the venue for the 1955 Asian-African Conference. The walls of the memorial hall display portraits of some of the leaders of the countries that initiated and organized this grand event, including Zhou Enlai, Norodom Sihanouk, and Gamal Abdel Nasser.

At this conference (also known as the "Bandung Conference"), 10 principles were adopted. On February 23 of this year, Indonesian President Suharto and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reaffirmed during their meeting in Tokyo that the relationship between China and Indonesia should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the 10 principles of the Bandung Conference. The Chinese delegation will depart from Jakarta tomorrow morning, traveling via Singapore to return home.

    我代表团参观亚非会议纪念馆
    据新华社雅加达12月10日电　（记者李永明）前来参加中国与印尼恢复外交关系会谈的中国代表团今天上午参观了万隆市“亚非会议纪念馆”。
    座落在万隆市市中心的“亚非会议纪念馆”是1955年亚非会议的会址。纪念馆墙上挂着当年发起和组织这次盛会的一些国家领导人的像，其中有周恩来、西哈努克、纳赛尔等。
    在这次会议上（又称“万隆会议”），通过了10项原则。今年2月23日，印尼总统苏哈托与中国外长钱其琛在东京会晤中，双方重申中国与印尼关系应建立在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议10项原则的基础上。中国代表团将于明天早晨离开雅加达途经新加坡回国。
