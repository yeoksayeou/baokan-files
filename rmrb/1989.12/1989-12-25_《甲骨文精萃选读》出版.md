Edition: 6

The book "Selected Readings of Oracle Bone Script" is edited by Wang Yuxin, Yang Shengnan, and Nie Yuhai, and published by the Language and Literature Press. This book is compiled from 692 selected pieces out of 150,000 oracle bone inscriptions. Its features include precise selection of pieces, accurate rubbings, and error-free annotations. The annotations are presented in a manner consistent with the shape of the oracle bone rubbings, making it convenient for cross-referencing. The book also includes a "Stroke Index" and a "Source Table for Selected Pieces" at the end, facilitating the retrieval and tracing of the sources of the pieces in the "Selected Readings."

The pieces collected in this book, such as those from "Collected Oracle Bone Inscriptions," "Oracle Bones from Xiaotun South Site," and "White's Collection of Oracle Bone Inscriptions," are of significant academic value. For scholars engaged in research, these pieces can serve as clues to find related content in the original books.

    《甲骨文精萃选读》出版
    《甲骨文精萃选读》由王宇信、杨升南、聂玉海主编，语文出版社出版。本书是从十五万片甲骨文中选取精萃六百九十二片编释而成的。其特点是选片精、摹写准、释文无误。释文采用与甲骨摹本片形相一致的方式，附于每页之后，极便于对读。书后附有文字“笔画索引”和“选读各片来源表”，以便检索和查寻《选读》各片的来源。
    本书所收各片的《甲骨文合集》、《小屯南地甲骨》、《怀特氏旧藏甲骨文集》等书，有重大学术价值的甲骨，对从事研究工作的学者，可以这些片子为线索，寻找有关原书类同的内容。　（项北）
