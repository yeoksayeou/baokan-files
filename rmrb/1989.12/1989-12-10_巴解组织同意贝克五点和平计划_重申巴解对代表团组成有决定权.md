PLO Agrees to Baker's Five-Point Peace Plan
Insists on Right to Determine Composition of Delegation

	Helsinki, December 8 (Xinhua) - According to reports from Finnish newspapers today, Sha'at Nabil, Chairman of the External Relations Committee of the Palestine National Council, stated in Helsinki on December 7 that the PLO agrees to the five-point peace plan recently proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Baker for direct talks between Palestine and Israel. However, he emphasized that the PLO has the right to determine the composition of the Palestinian delegation.

	Sha'at made these remarks at a discussion on Middle East peace held in Helsinki. He pointed out that the key issue remains the composition of the delegation.

	He said that the Palestinian delegation does not necessarily have to include leaders of the PLO; it can be composed of Palestinians from the occupied territories and those living outside the occupied territories.

	According to other reports, Israel has confirmed that the foreign ministers of the United States, Egypt, and Israel may meet early next year to prepare for direct formal meetings between Palestine and Israel in Cairo.

    巴解组织同意贝克五点和平计划
    重申巴解对代表团组成有决定权
    新华社赫尔辛基12月8日电　据芬兰报纸今天报道，巴勒斯坦全国委员会外事委员会主席沙阿特·纳比勒7日在赫尔辛基表示，巴解组织同意美国国务卿贝克最近提出关于巴勒斯坦和以色列开始直接进行对话的五点和平计划，但他同时强调，巴解有权决定巴勒斯坦代表团的组成。
    沙阿特是在赫尔辛基举行的有关中东和平的讨论会上说这番话的。他指出，现在的关键问题仍然是代表团的组成问题。
    他说，巴勒斯坦代表团并非要由巴解的领导成员参加，它可以由被占领区和在被占领区以外居住的巴勒斯坦人组成。
    另据报道，以色列已证实，美国、埃及和以色列的外长可能于明年初进行会晤，为巴勒斯坦和以色列在开罗进行直接正式会晤作准备。
