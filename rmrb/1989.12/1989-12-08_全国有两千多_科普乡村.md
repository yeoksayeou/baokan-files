Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7th.

	The "science popularization villages" that have emerged across China's vast rural areas are using science popularization networks to organically connect individual households under the responsibility system. Currently, there are over 2,000 such "science popularization villages" nationwide, forming specialized production divisions in areas such as planting, breeding, processing, and village enterprises. This has led to the formation of various specialized households, specialized villages, and specialized commodity bases, promoting the adjustment of rural industrial structures and the development of commodity economies.

	"Science popularization villages" are selected based on certain standards by relevant departments. They not only require higher total industrial and agricultural output values and per capita income compared to ordinary villages but also require notable achievements in spiritual civilization construction.

    全国有两千多“科普乡村”
    据新华社北京12月7日电　（记者杨兆波）正在我国广大农村兴起的“科普乡村”，通过科普网络把一家一户联产承包有机地组织起来。目前，全国已有2000多个“科普乡村”，形成了按种植、养殖、加工、乡村企业等精细分工的专业化生产，进而形成了各种专业大户、专业村和专业化商品基地，促进了农村产业结构的调整和商品经济的发展。
    “科普乡村”是依照一定的标准由有关部门评选出来的，不仅要求工农业总产值和人均收入高于一般乡村，还要求在精神文明建设中成绩显著。
