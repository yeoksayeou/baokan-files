In modern society, where commerce and industry are highly developed, the widespread use of packaging materials has led to discarded plastic bags, aluminum cans, and other items being found almost everywhere in the natural environment. These items take about 100 years to decompose naturally, and even when disposed of as waste, they can pollute the environment and become a public nuisance. Currently, some countries are researching a relatively ideal solution: zero-degree packaging, a packaging method that produces no waste.

Recently, a German engineer invented a type of cup made from starch that does not dissolve when in contact with liquids. This cup can be used to hold dairy products, and citizens can consume the cup itself; once discarded, it easily decomposes in the natural environment. A research institution in Frankfurt, Germany, has also developed a type of preservative film that is not easily broken but dissolves in water within 10 minutes. This film can be used to preserve the freshness of food and fruits. The Midland Chemical Company in the United States has also developed a type of bag made from a combination of starch and synthetic fibers, which can decompose into water and carbon dioxide in the natural environment. Although these packaging methods are not yet 100% zero-degree packaging, they at least do not produce waste that harms the environment, as these packaging materials can easily decompose and become part of nature.

In fact, to save resources and protect the environment, the oldest methods, such as using bottles or bowls to buy soy sauce or seasonings, are often the most meaningful.

    零度包装
    在工商业发达的现代社会，随着包装材料的广泛采用，被人遗弃在大自然环境里的胶袋、铝罐等也几乎随处可见。而这些东西，要100年以后才会自然分解，即使当垃圾处理，也会对环境造成污染，形成社会公害。目前有些国家正在研究的一个比较理想的办法，就是采用零度包装，这是一种不制造任何垃圾的包装方式。
    最近西德一位工程师发明了一种由淀粉做成、遇流质不会溶化的包装杯，可以盛装奶制品，市民可以吃下这种塑胶杯；一旦弃置，也很容易在大自然中消解掉。
    西德法兰克福一个科研机构，最近也推出一种不易破但10分钟可溶于水的保鲜胶膜，可用来保持食物、水果等的新鲜度。美国的米特兰化学公司，也研制成一种由淀粉及合成纤维结合而成的胶袋，可以在大自然中分解成水及二氧化碳。这类包装虽然还不是百分之百的零度包装，但至少不会制造破坏环境的垃圾，因为这些包装品容易消解，成为大自然的一部分。
    其实，为了节省资源及保护环境，诸如拿瓶或碗买酱油或调味品等一类最古老的方法，往往还是最有意思的。
