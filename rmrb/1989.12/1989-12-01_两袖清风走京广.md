On the Beijing-to-Guangzhou 47/48 express train, there is an elderly conductor named Yao Lirong. He is over fifty, and his weathered face exudes kindness, determination, and integrity. He has been working on this route for 14 years, enduring countless storms and challenges.

Some people say that working on the Beijing-Guangzhou line is like being a god, but Yao Lirong never felt that way. Each trip takes five days, and during this time, he has to work tirelessly in the crowded, noisy, and bumpy train. This is far from the leisurely life of a tourist. Instead, he has to navigate the train dozens of times to complete his duties. In a year, he spends over 200 days living this hectic and irregular life on the train.

With the development of the reform and opening-up policy, more and more people are traveling between Beijing and Guangzhou for business. The phrase "give a cigarette first, talk about money later" has become common. Suddenly, the Beijing-Guangzhou line has become a strange phenomenon, confusing and worrying many.

Money, in the eyes of some people, seems to be the almighty god. But Yao Lirong sees money and profit as trivial. He says, "You can't bring money with you when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die. People should not be blinded by money."

On January 9, 1989, Yao Lirong caught a passenger named Wang Xiaozhong carrying 1,492 gas lighters worth over 20,000 yuan on the 48th train. He immediately took Wang to the dining car for questioning. Wang, seeing no one around, quietly took out a stack of money: "Officer, here's 2,000 yuan for you. Let me go, or I'll be ruined."

"You want to bribe a law enforcement officer, and you should be punished even more severely!" Yao Lirong sternly rebuked, scaring Wang into quickly putting the money away.

During the 1989 Spring Festival, the train was overcrowded by 100%. Some people, in order to get a berth, were willing to pay a high price. One day, Yao Lirong was cleaning the berth car and registering passengers on the 48th train. A heavily made-up young woman handed him two packs of imported cigarettes: "Officer, let's talk. You help me get two berths, and I'll give you two packs of foreign cigarettes. How about it?"

Yao Lirong thought: I've seen women like you before. Do you think I'm worth just two packs of cigarettes? Even if you gave me 10 boxes of foreign cigarettes, I wouldn't do anything wrong.

The woman insisted: "My dad is an old cadre. You and he are both old-fashioned people, what good is that? You only earn a hundred or so yuan a month. Look at me, this gold necklace alone is worth 3,000 yuan." Yao Lirong smiled contemptuously and said, "Your 3,000 yuan necklace is earned honestly and shines with glory, but if it's not, it's shameful!" In front of everyone, Yao Lirong unceremoniously removed the two ticketless people from the berth car.

At that time, Yao Lirong's travel bag also contained two packs of imported Liangyou cigarettes, which his eldest son Yao Jingwu had asked him to buy in Guangzhou for his wedding. Yao Lirong had specially requested permission from the team leader and bought them himself for over 100 yuan at a store.

Someone on the train once approached Yao Lirong and suggested, "You just need to put in some money and don't have to do anything. Later, you just wait to collect the money." Someone else said to Yao Lirong, "You can make a hundred or so yuan just by carrying something on one trip. Don't be so stubborn." Yao Lirong just smiled and shook his head to decline.

Some people secretly cursed Yao Lirong, "Stupid old-fashioned guy." Even his children at home were very dissatisfied with him, often complaining, "Dad, you've been running to Guangzhou so many times, and all you know how to do is pickled cabbage at home as a snack. If you brought back a few things, you could make a few hundred yuan with one handout. With money, you can eat whatever you want!"

Yao Lirong actually understood the meaning of these words. His children work in society, and their colleagues know he is a conductor on the Beijing-Guangzhou line. They can't help but ask him to carry something or arrange a berth. If he doesn't help, how can he ask for help in the future?

But Yao Lirong always told his children, "The train is not ours. If the crew members on the train all use their convenient conditions to do business, what will the train become!"

Years of hard work on the train, the highly tense and irregular life, have made Yao Lirong's health worse. He often has a fever and when he gets sick, he feels hot inside and cold outside, with goosebumps all over his body. His dark yellow face is covered in sweat. He has been to the hospital several times, but the doctors couldn't find the cause of his illness and only gave him some anti-inflammatory and fever-reducing medicine. He thought he could endure it, so every time he got sick, he would use the method of covering himself with two quilts to sweat it out.

Many people know that Yao Lirong has a habit of drinking alcohol. When it comes to drinking, Yao Lirong can be called a heavy drinker. Yao Lirong's alcohol addiction is strong, but once he gets on the train, he absolutely avoids alcohol. No matter who says or persuades, he firmly refuses to drink a drop. To those who try to persuade him to drink for various reasons, Yao Lirong just smiles and gives a salute to acknowledge their good intentions.

Yao Lirong has always reminded his apprentices, "Working on the Beijing-Guangzhou line is not easy. Most of the people coming and going are doing business. Some people make a lot of money and want to use money to make us their protectors. We must remember that we are police officers and not be tempted by money. Not a penny of what we shouldn't take should be taken!"

Yao Lirong understands that one tree does not make a forest. As a model Communist Party member, he not only needs to uphold integrity and serve the people but also needs to influence and unite his fellow conductors to work together to rectify the party's style and maintain the reputation of the railway.

    两袖清风走京广
    艾安军
    在北京开往广州的47／48次特快列车上，有一位年过半百的老乘警，一张饱经风霜的脸，透着和蔼、坚毅和正气。他叫姚立荣，是北京铁路公安分局乘警队乘警，在这趟列车上，他已经度过了风风雨雨14个春秋。
    有人说，京广线上的乘务员是离地三尺赛神仙。老姚却似乎从来没有这样感觉过。每趟走车都需要5天时间打一个来回，整整5个昼夜要在疾驰颠簸的车上忙碌，这可绝非像观光旅游那样悠闲自在。恰恰相反，他要在这5天里从拥挤噪杂不堪的列车上来回穿梭几十趟完成他的工作程序。一年就要有200多天在车上度过这种紧张劳累又没有规律的生活。
    随着开放搞活形势的发展，往返于北京、广州之间做买卖的人越来越多，求人先递烟，办事先说钱。
    一时间，京广线上出现了一种厄尔尼诺现像，令人晕眩费解，更引人深思忧虑。
    钱，在某些人的眼里似乎成了万能的上帝。老姚却把钱和利看得很轻，他说：生不带来死不带去，人活着不能掉在钱眼里。
    1989年1月9日，姚立荣在48次列车上查获旅客王小中携带1492个气体打火机，价值2万余元，当即将王小中带到餐车审查。王小中见四周无人，悄悄拿出一叠子钱：“师傅，给你2000块钱，放了我吧，不然我就倾家荡产了。”
    “你想贿赂执法人员，更应加重处罚！”老姚义正辞严地大声怒斥道，吓得王小中忙收回了钱。
    1989年春运期间，这趟列车的超员程度达到百分之百，有些人为了能补到卧铺票，而不惜重金相求。一天，老姚在48次列车上清理卧铺车厢，进行旅客登记时，一位浓妆艳抹的女青年拿出两条进口高级烟凑到老姚身边：“乘警老师傅，咱商量商量，你帮我办两个卧铺，我给你两条洋烟，怎么样？”
    老姚心想：你这样的女人我见多了，少跟我玩这套鬼花活；我就值这两条烟钱？你这会儿给我10箱洋烟，不该办的，我也决不给你办。
    女乘客死皮赖脸地说：“我爸是老干部，你和他一样都是些正统一辈子的老八板，有啥用，不就一月挣一百多块钱。看咱，光这条金项链，就值3000块。”老姚藐然一笑说：“你3000块钱的项链是正道来的带着光彩，不是正道来的，带着可耻！”在众目睽睽下，老姚毫不客气地把这俩无票人清理出卧铺车厢。
    而此时，姚立荣的旅行包内也装着两条良友牌进口香烟，那是他的大儿子姚景武托父亲在广州买来准备办婚事，老姚特意请示队领导批准后，自己花100多块钱在商店买的。
    列车上，曾有人主动找老姚商量，你只要出钱搭伙，什么也不用管，到时候就等着拿钱好啦。也有人对老姚说：“你走一趟车捎点东西就能赚个百八十块，别总那么死心眼了。”老姚笑着摇摇头表示回绝。
    一些人暗地里骂老姚：“死不开窍的老八板。”就连他家里的孩子都对他极不满意，常常抱怨：“爸爸你跑了这么多年广州，就知道在家腌白菜疙瘩当下酒菜，你要倒几件东西过来，出手就能赚个几百块，有钱，你想吃啥没有！”
    老姚其实也很理解这些话的涵义，孩子们在社会上工作，周围的同事都知道他是京广列车上的乘警，免不了这个托捎点东西那个办个卧铺，你不帮忙，往后有事还怎么去求人。
    可老姚却总对孩子们说：“车又不是咱家的，如果车上乘务员都利用方便条件倒买卖，这车会成个什么样子！”
    在列车上长年累月的奔波，高度紧张而又根本没有规律的生活，使老姚的身体愈来愈差，他常常发烧，常常犯起病来内烧外冷浑身起鸡皮疙瘩，那黧黑焦黄的脸上冒着虚汗，几次到医院，医生也没有查出他的病源，只好给他点消炎、退烧的药吃。他自认为顶得住，于是每次犯病他都用捂两床被子出一身大汗的办法凑合着。
    不少人都知道他生活中有喝酒的嗜好。说起喝酒，老姚可称得上是海量。姚立荣的酒瘾大，可他到了车上就绝对忌酒，无论谁说谁劝，他愣是滴酒不沾，对那些怀着各种目的劝他赏脸来一盅的人们，老姚微笑着一个举手礼算是领了他们的心意。
    老姚对他带过的几个徒弟叮咛过：“在京广线上走车，乘警工作不好干，南来北往的大部分都是跑买卖的，有的人赚了大钱，想拿钱让我们当保护伞，咱得记得自个儿是公安人员，别见钱眼开，不该拿的钱，一分也不要！”
    独木不成林。乘警老姚懂得：光是自己遵纪爱民、两袖清风还不够，还要以一个共产党员模范作用去影响和团结同组的乘警们，为端正党风维护路誉而努力。
