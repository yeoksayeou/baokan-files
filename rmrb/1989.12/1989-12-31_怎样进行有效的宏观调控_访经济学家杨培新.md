    How to Conduct Effective Macroeconomic Regulation
    —An Interview with Economist Yang Peixin
    By Jì Hóngqǐng, Reporter for People's Daily

    “Some people say that the current economy is experiencing stagflation. What do you think?” At the end of the year, the reporter interviewed economist and researcher at the State Council Development Research Center, Yang Peixin, starting with this question.

    Yang Peixin said, “I don’t think so. What is stagflation? Stagflation is when prices skyrocket while the economy stagnates. Our country’s situation is: current prices have stabilized, inflation has been curbed, false purchasing power has disappeared, and total demand is gradually shrinking. This shows that the rectification and control work that began in September 1988 has started to show results. As for the temporary phenomenon of product backlog and market sluggishness, this is an inevitable occurrence during monetary tightening and cannot be seen as economic stagflation.”

    Currently, the issue of “triangular debt” and “debt chain” among enterprises is a hot topic. Banks are issuing startup loans to help large and medium-sized enterprises solve their difficulties. However, the loans are like a drop in the bucket. Some enterprises spend the loans within an hour and a half. The “debt chain” not only has not been eliminated but is showing signs of expansion. Why is this? Yang Peixin believes that the main reason is that the problem of product sales has not been solved. Products are still piled up, and enterprises are still struggling. He advocates that while helping to solve the working capital needs of large and medium-sized enterprises, we should focus on increasing the purchasing loans for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, playing their role in regulating social production. With money, state-owned commerce can selectively purchase high-quality, unique, and new industrial products, accelerate their sales, and prevent short-line industries and key enterprises from accumulating products. Enterprises can then repay their debts, continuously expand reproduction, and prevent industrial production from sliding. By ensuring the final product purchase, funds can flow from processing enterprises to raw material enterprises, layer by layer alleviating the “debt chain.” The market will be activated, and enterprises will also be revitalized. He said that banks should, to the greatest extent possible, meet the funding needs for the purchase of grain, cotton, oil, sugarcane, sugar beets, wool, and other economic crops, expanding purchases. This can enrich market supply, provide the raw materials needed by production enterprises, and increase exports. For every yuan of agricultural and sideline products purchased, the value added after processing can reach 3 yuan. In the purchase of agricultural products, injecting money will not cause inflation. Farmers will have money to buy more industrial products. In this way, the market can truly be activated, both mobilizing the enthusiasm of farmers and expanding the market for industrial products. Enterprises will also be revitalized, and the entire national economy will be revitalized.

    How to combine rectification and control with further deepening of reform? Yang Peixin believes that strengthening effective macroeconomic regulation is very important. He reviewed the situation in the early 1950s. At that time, to stop the inflation left by the Kuomintang government, to make private industry, individual farmers, and other economic components operate under the leadership of state-owned economy, and to restore and develop the national economy, the central government established the Financial and Economic Commission to direct the bank, finance, trade, and other comprehensive economic departments to effectively lead and regulate the national economy. A set of macroeconomic information mechanisms played a huge role. Now, our country has actually formed a market with public ownership as the mainstay and composed of various economic components. Implementing a socialist planned economy and market regulation combined, it is impossible to rely solely on five-year plans and annual plans to make macroeconomic arrangements once and for all. It is more necessary to establish a macroeconomic information mechanism that reports every ten days and a flexible mechanism that can be adjusted at any time to adapt to the ever-changing market. Of course, it is not necessary to rebuild the Central Financial and Economic Commission now. The role of banks can be utilized to establish and improve the macroeconomic regulation mechanism with the central bank as the mainstay. The People's Bank of China can establish an authoritative macroeconomic information network, while various specialized banks can grasp the dynamics of funds, market, investment, foreign trade, foreign exchange, foreign capital, and international market dynamics in their respective regions, providing timely reference for the State Council and making decisions. When talking about investment dynamics, the reporter asked, “How can we effectively prevent investment distortion, irrational structure, and low investment returns during the rectification and control?” Yang Peixin thought for a moment and said, “We are basically using administrative methods to stop investment distortion, pushing down one side and lifting up the other. We must establish a new effective mechanism and use economic methods to treat the root cause.” He mentioned an incident: The Heilongjiang Provincial government originally wanted to build a watch factory and was repeatedly advised against it. Later, the Construction Bank provided the national production, supply and demand situation of watches, and the production capacity of watches under construction and about to be put into production. The relevant leaders said in conviction, “It’s too late to do it now.” Yang Peixin said, “Information is life,” “Information is a command.” Whether a project should be started or not; which products should be increased and which should not be developed, it is not enough to just announce the industrial policy without providing specific measures and quantities. The People's Construction Bank has conducted systematic investigations on key industries and important products, accumulating experience in issuing construction and technical transformation loans. If the Construction Bank can be built into an institution that grasps industrial policies and adjusts the national economic proportion relationship at any time, it will be very appropriate. Adapting to the current situation, establishing a new macroeconomic regulation mechanism is the key to curing inflation and investment distortion, and to bringing the national economy into a stable, sustained, and coordinated development track. This is the key point emphasized in Yang Peixin's speech.

    怎样进行有效的宏观调控
    ——访经济学家杨培新
    本报记者　计泓赓
    “有人说，当前经济出现了滞胀现象，你认为如何？”年终岁末记者访问经济学家、国务院发展研究中心研究员杨培新时，提出了这一问题。我们的谈话便从这里开始。
    杨培新说：“我不这么认为。什么叫滞胀？滞胀是一面物价飞涨，一面经济停滞。我国的情况是：当前物价已趋向稳定，通货膨胀受到遏制，虚假购买力消失，总需求逐步缩小。这说明，从1988年9月开始的整顿治理工作，已初见成效。至于一时间出现的产品滞销、市场疲软情况，那是紧缩通货中难免的现象，不能看成是经济滞胀。”
    当前企业之间的“三角债”“债务链”，是热门话题之一。银行正发放启动贷款，帮助大中企业解决困难。可是杯水车薪，有的企业拿到贷款，一个半小时就花光了。“债务链”不但未消除，反有扩大的趋势。这是为什么呢？杨培新认为，主要原因是产品销路问题未解决。产品仍积压在那里，企业还是活不起来。他主张在帮助解决大中企业流动资金需要的同时，应着重增加对国营商业和供销社的收购贷款，发挥他们调节社会生产的作用。国营商业有了钱，可以有选择地收购名、优、特、新工业产品，加快推销，使短线行业、骨干企业不积压产品，企业就能偿还债务，持续扩大再生产，防止工业生产滑坡。从保证最终产品收购，使资金从加工企业流向原材料企业，就能层层缓解“债务链”。市场活了，企业也就活了。他说，银行应最大限度地满足粮、棉、油、甘蔗、甜菜、羊毛等经济作物收购的资金需要，扩大收购，既可丰富市场供应，提供生产企业所需要的原材料，又可增加出口。收购一元农副产品，加工以后可创产值3元。在收购农产品中，投放货币，不会引起通货膨胀。广大农民手里有了钱，就会购买更多的工业品。这样，才能把市场真正搞活，既调动农民的积极性，又开拓工业品的市场。企业也因此而活了，整个国民经济也活了。
    怎么结合整顿治理，进一步深化改革？杨培新认为加强有效的宏观调控很重要。他回顾了50年代初的情况。当时为了制止国民党政府留下的通货膨胀，使私营工商业、个体农民等多种经济成分在国营经济领导下运转起来，恢复和发展国民经济，中央成立了财政经济委员会，指挥银行、财政、贸易等综合经济部门对国民经济进行有效的领导和调节。一套宏观经济信息机制发挥了巨大作用。现在，我国实际上已形成以公有制为主、由多种经济成分组成的市场。实行社会主义的计划经济和市场调节相结合，不可能单纯依靠5年计划、年度计划一劳永逸地作出宏观经济安排，更需要建立宏观经济信息逐旬上报机制和能随时进行调整的灵活机制，以适应千变万化的市场。当然，现在没有必要重建中财委，可以发挥银行的作用，建立并完善以中央银行为主的宏观经济调控机制，由中国人民银行建立有权威的宏观经济信息网，各专业银行则分片掌握资金动态，市场动态，投资动态，外贸、外汇、外资动态，国际市场动态等，随时提供国务院参考，并作出决断。讲到投资动态，记者问：“在治理整顿中怎样有效防止投资畸形膨胀、结构不合理、投资效益低下状况呢？”杨培新略作沉思，说：“我们现在基本是运用行政方法制止投资膨胀，按下葫芦浮起瓢。必须建立新的有效机制，运用经济方法根治。”他谈起了这样一件事：黑龙江省原来想上手表厂，屡劝不止，后来建设银行提供了全国手表的产量、供求情况和在建即将投产的手表厂的产量，有关领导人信服地说：“搞晚了，是不能再上了。”杨培新说：“信息就是生命”，“信息就是命令”，哪个项目该上，哪个项目不该上；哪种产品宜于增产，哪种产品不宜发展，单是公布产业政策而不提供具体的度和量，是不够的。中国人民建设银行对重点行业、重要产品均进行过系统调查，积累了发放基建和技术改造贷款的经验，如能把建设银行建成为掌握产业政策，随时调整国民经济比例关系的机构，驾轻就熟，是很相宜的。适应当前形势，建立新的宏观经济调控机制，是根治通货膨胀和投资膨胀，把国民经济纳入稳定、持续、协调发展轨道的关键所在，这是杨培新谈话强调的要点。
