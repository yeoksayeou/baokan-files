He said, "President, you are the pioneer and founder of Sino-UAE friendly cooperation. We are very grateful for your concern and attention to the development of Sino-UAE relations." He added, "Developing friendly relations with the UAE is our established policy. I firmly believe that the bilateral relationship, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries."

Regarding the situation in the Gulf, Chairman Yang said, "The current situation in the Gulf has eased, and the Gulf countries are entering a relatively stable period of construction. Additionally, the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq and their direct talks mark an important turning point in the Iran-Iraq war. We are pleased about this. We support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to fully implement Security Council Resolution 598 to facilitate a transition from ceasefire to lasting peace. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China is willing to work with the international community to continue contributing to the Iran-Iraq peace talks."
