The General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council recently issued the "Notice on Further Strengthening the Work of Letters and Visits."

The "Notice" states that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and various levels of Party committees and governments, the work of letters and visits has made significant efforts and achieved remarkable results in reflecting public opinion, maintaining stability and unity, promoting clean governance, solving problems for the people, and bridging the gap between leading organs and the masses. Especially during the spring and summer of this year, when some places experienced turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the broad masses of cadres on the front line of letters and visits maintained consistency with the Party Central Committee, adhered to principles, and worked hard, making contributions to stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots.

The "Notice" points out that, looking at the situation nationwide, there are still some problems in the work of letters and visits that need to be further addressed: some places and departments do not attach enough importance to the work of letters and visits; some issues reported by the masses are not followed up after being transferred, and there is no enforcement of the results; the correct criticisms, reasonable suggestions, and actual problems raised by the masses have not been addressed. The existence of these problems is not conducive to strengthening the relationship between the Party and the government with the people, is not conducive to strengthening socialist democracy and the rule of law, and is not conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. The "Notice" proposes:

1. All levels of Party committees and governments should attach importance to the work of letters and visits and strengthen their leadership over the work of letters and visits.

Recently, central leaders have repeatedly made important remarks on the work of letters and visits, affirming the important position of the work of letters and visits in the work of the Party and the government, clarifying the basic tasks and requirements of the work of letters and visits. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "The work of letters and visits is an important channel for our Party and government to practice democracy, understand public sentiment, and connect with the masses. Currently, in order to better implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, all levels of Party committees and governments must strengthen their leadership over the work of letters and visits, so that it can play a greater role in strengthening socialist democracy and the rule of law, and in strengthening the relationship between the Party and the government with the people." Comrade Li Peng pointed out: "Letters from the people are a manifestation of the people's trust in the Party and the government, and are an important channel for them to express their opinions to the leading organs. Highly valuing and seriously handling letters from the people is a responsibility of the leading organs and an important link in maintaining close ties with the masses." He also demanded "to carefully review and handle each piece of correspondence fairly, so as not to disappoint the people's hopes." Comrade Qiao Shi also pointed out: "The work of letters and visits is an important work for our Party and government to maintain close ties with the people. We must ensure that the channels are unblocked, and seriously handle the problems reflected by the people, coordinate with relevant departments and localities, clarify the situation, and properly resolve the issues." All regions and departments should seriously study and implement the opinions of the central leaders, raise awareness, strengthen leadership, and better serve the Party's central work through the work of letters and visits.

2. Several key areas of work to focus on at present.

	(i) Do a good job in maintaining stability and upholding unity and stability. Maintaining social stability and consolidating unity and stability is an important and ongoing task in the work of letters and visits. Local authorities should strengthen grassroots work on letters and visits and resolve local issues raised by the masses. They should regularly propagate the country's laws, relevant regulations, and the Party's policies to the masses, do a good job in ideological guidance, and ensure that ideological work is carried out throughout the work of letters and visits. Simple and hasty actions should be avoided. For those who deliberately cause trouble and instigate unrest, public security and other relevant departments should handle them seriously in accordance with the facts and relevant regulations.

	(ii) Fully respect and give play to the supervisory role of the masses, and assist the Party and the government in strengthening clean governance. Mass supervision is an effective measure to strengthen clean governance. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have made a series of important decisions to strengthen clean governance and rectification, which have been actively supported by the broad masses of cadres and the people. For issues reported by the masses, they should be promptly transferred to relevant localities and functional departments for proper handling, with each case being followed up. Those who report issues should be encouraged; those whose reports are found to be unfounded should be clarified; and those who fabricate facts and falsely accuse others should be dealt with seriously.

	(iii) Pay attention to the positive opinions of the masses. The broad masses of cadres and the people, out of concern for the cause of the Party, have put forward a large number of positive opinions through the channels of letters and visits. For the correct criticisms and reasonable suggestions or proposals of the masses, they should be seriously treated and properly handled, and there should be a response. Effective measures should be taken to actively solicit the opinions of the masses. Some places and departments have established systems such as leaders receiving the masses, target management responsibility, and replying to the masses, which are worth promoting.

	(iv) According to the country's laws, relevant regulations, and the Party's policies, transfer the actual problems reflected in the letters and visits of the masses to relevant functional departments for proper handling. Solving problems for the people is a requirement of the Party and the government's wholehearted service to the people and is an ongoing task of the work of letters and visits. Each problem raised by the masses should be treated with enthusiasm and responsibility, and transferred to relevant functional departments for proper handling according to the country's laws, relevant regulations, and the Party's policies. For those who raise demands that do not conform to laws, regulations, and policies, patient and detailed ideological work should be done to help them correctly handle the issues.

3. Strengthen the construction of the letters and visits departments and the letters and visits workforce.

The letters and visits departments are specialized agencies for the Party and the government to handle letters and visits from the masses. Under the leadership of the Party committees and governments, the letters and visits departments should seriously listen to and truthfully reflect the opinions of the masses; promptly transfer letters and visits cases to relevant localities and functional departments, follow up and understand the handling results; pay attention to the coordination and implementation of the handling of letters and visits cases across regions and departments; and inform the letter writers and visitors of the handling results.

The letters and visits departments should adhere to the four cardinal principles and maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee; continue to adhere to the principle of "graded responsibility and centralized handling"; gradually improve the letters and visits work system and strengthen business guidance. The letters and visits agencies are the organizational guarantee for doing a good job in letters and visits work and should be further strengthened.

Cadres engaged in the work of letters and visits should continue to carry forward the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and the working style of closely connecting with the masses and striving hard. Party committees and governments should care about the work, study, and life of letters and visits cadres.

    中共中央办公厅国务院办公厅发出通知
    进一步加强信访工作
    当前要着重做好维护安定团结等四项工作
    新华社北京12月21日电　中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅近日发出了《关于进一步加强信访工作的通知》。
    《通知》说，在党中央、国务院和各级党委、政府的领导下，信访工作在反映社情民意、维护安定团结、促进廉政建设、为民排忧解难、沟通领导机关同人民群众的关系等方面，做了大量工作，取得了明显的成效。特别是今年春夏之交在一些地方发生动乱和北京发生反革命暴乱期间，信访战线上的广大同志同党中央保持一致，身处一线，坚持原则，努力工作，为制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱做出了贡献。
    《通知》指出，从全国的情况看，信访工作中还存在着一些需要进一步解决的问题：有的地方和部门对信访工作重视不够；对群众揭发检举的有些问题，转办以后，不抓查处结果；对群众的正确批评、合理意见和要求解决的实际问题，没有回声。上述问题的存在，不利于密切党和政府与人民群众的关系，不利于加强社会主义民主与法制的建设，不利于调动群众的积极因素。《通知》提出：
    一、各级党委和政府要重视信访工作，切实加强对信访工作的领导。
    近来，中央领导同志多次对信访工作提出重要意见，肯定了信访工作在党和政府工作中的重要地位，明确了信访工作的基本任务和对信访工作的要求。江泽民同志指出：“信访工作是我们党和政府发扬民主，体察民情，联系群众的重要渠道。当前，为了更好地贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，各级党委和政府要切实加强对信访工作的领导，使其在加强社会主义民主与法制的建设、密切党和政府与人民群众的关系中，发挥更大的作用。”李鹏同志指出：“人民来信，是人民对党和政府信任的表现，是他们向领导机关反映意见的重要渠道。高度重视和认真处理人民来信，是领导机关应尽的责任，是密切联系群众的重要环节。”他还要求“认真查阅，秉公处理每一封信件，以不辜负人民的希望。”乔石同志也指出：“信访工作是我们党和政府密切联系人民群众的一项重要工作。要确保渠道畅通，对人民反映的问题要认真对待，配合有关部门、地方，弄清情况，妥善解决。”各地区各部门要认真学习和贯彻落实中央领导同志的意见，提高认识，加强领导，使信访工作更好地为党的中心工作服务。
    二、当前要着重做好的几项工作。
    （一）做好稳定工作，维护安定团结。维护社会稳定，巩固安定团结，是信访工作中一项重要的、经常性的任务。各地要切实加强基层的信访工作，就地处理好群众的信访问题。要经常向群众宣传国家的法律、有关规定和党的方针、政策，做好思想疏导工作，把思想工作贯穿在信访工作的始终，切忌简单从事。对于确属无理取闹、带头串连滋事的上访人员，公安及其它有关部门要依据事实和有关规定严肃处理。
    （二）充分尊重和发挥群众的监督作用，协助党和政府加强廉政建设。群众监督是加强廉政建设的有效措施。党中央、国务院为加强廉政建设、搞好治理整顿作出了一系列重要决定，得到广大干部群众的积极支持。对群众揭发检举的问题，要及时转交有关地方和职能部门妥善处理，件件落实。对揭发检举有功人员应予以鼓励；反映问题不实的，要予以澄清；对捏造事实、诬告他人的行为，要严肃处理。
    （三）要重视群众的积极意见。广大干部群众出于对党的事业的关心，通过信访渠道提出了大量的积极意见。对于群众的正确批评和合理意见或建议，要认真对待，妥善处理，并要有回声。要采取有效措施，主动征询群众意见。有些地方和部门建立的领导干部接待群众制度、目标管理责任制度、给群众复信制度等，是值得提倡的。
    （四）按照国家法律、有关规定和党的政策，转请有关职能部门妥善处理群众来信来访反映的实际问题。为民排忧解难，是党和政府全心全意为人民服务宗旨的要求，也是信访工作一项经常性的任务。要满腔热情、认真负责地对待群众反映的每一个问题，按照国家法律、有关规定和党的政策转请有关职能部门妥善处理。对提出不符合法律、规定和政策的要求的群众，要耐心细致地做好思想工作，使其能正确对待。
    三、加强信访部门和信访工作队伍的建设。
    信访部门是党和政府受理群众来信来访的专门机构。在党委和政府的领导下，信访部门要认真听取和如实反映群众的意见；及时向有关地方、职能部门转办信访案件，催办和了解处理结果；对跨地区、跨部门的有关信访案件，要注意协调落实处理单位；向来信来访人回告处理结果。
    信访部门要坚持四项基本原则，同党中央保持高度一致；继续坚持“分级负责，归口处理”的原则；逐步完善信访工作制度，加强业务指导。信访机构是做好信访工作的组织保证，要进一步加强。
    从事信访工作的同志，要继续发扬全心全意为人民服务的精神和密切联系群众、艰苦奋斗的工作作风。党委和政府要关心信访干部的工作、学习和生活。
