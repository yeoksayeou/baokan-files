	Evergreen Pine
	Gao Fangxia

	On the summit of the mountains,
	Through wind and rain, day and night,
	You remain unchanged, your thousand-year green.
	Looking back,
	How many mountain paths have been left behind,
	Your thousand-year green remains unchanged.
	Walking this path is still this path,
	A heart has long since quietly sunk into the earth,
	Feeling the pulse of the motherland.

    绿松
    高芳霞
    群峰之巅
    风雨晨夕
    不改你千年绿容
    回首
    多少山路甩在身后
    你千年绿容不改
    走过这段路还是这段路
    一颗心早已悄然入地
    感受祖国母亲的脉搏
