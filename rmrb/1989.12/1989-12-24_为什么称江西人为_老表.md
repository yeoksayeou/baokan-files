According to legend, during the battles against the Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang was defeated and seriously injured. He fled to Kangshan in Jiangxi, where the local impoverished villagers, knowing he was fighting against the Yuan, hid him in a cave, treated his wounds, and provided him with food, allowing Zhu Yuanzhang's injuries to heal quickly. As he prepared to leave, he expressed his deep gratitude. The villagers, seemingly knowing what would happen, said to him, "If you become the emperor one day, you might not recognize us commoners!" Zhu Yuanzhang quickly replied, "I won't. If that day comes, you can come find me." The villagers said, "The imperial palace is so grand, how will we find you? Even if we find it, how can we commoners enter?" Zhu Yuanzhang solemnly said, "Just say you are my relatives, my 'laobiao,' and come to find me."

In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang became the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty. One year, a severe drought struck the Jiangnan region, with Jiangxi being the hardest hit. The common people still had to pay taxes to the court twice a year, in summer and autumn, and perform labor services according to their household registration. In desperation, the impoverished villagers remembered "Zhu Laobiao." Thus, they went to the imperial court, claiming to be Zhu Yuanzhang's relatives, and were allowed to enter the palace. To their surprise, Zhu Yuanzhang actually received them and listened carefully to their opinions and requests. As a result, that year, Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the reduction of their taxes. From then on, "laobiao" became a nickname for people from Jiangxi.

    为什么称江西人为“老表”
    传说朱元璋在同元朝军队的战斗中，被打得大败，而且负了重伤，逃到江西康山地方，当地贫苦乡民知道他是反对元朝的，就把他藏在山洞里，治伤供食，使朱元璋的伤口很快治愈。当要离别乡亲们时，他非常感激，老乡们却好像未卜先知地对他说：“要是你将来当了皇帝，恐怕就不认得我们平民了！”朱元璋连忙回答说：“不会的。如果真有那么一天的话，你们只管来找我。”老乡们说：“皇宫大院的，我们去哪里找？就算找到了，我们平民又哪里进得去？说说笑算了。”朱元璋却一本正经地说：“你们就说是我朱元璋的表亲来找就行了。”
    1368年，朱元璋当上了明朝开国皇帝。有一年，江南一带发生了旱灾，尤以江西为重。广大农民每年还是分夏秋两次向朝廷交纳赋税，并要按丁服“徭役”。贫苦乡民在无可奈何的情况下想起了“朱老表”。于是，乡民来到朝廷后，自称是朱元璋的老表，获准进了皇宫大院。他们万万没想到，朱元璋真的召见了他们，并详细地听了他们的意见和要求。结果，在这一年，朱元璋下令减免了他们的税收。从此，“老表”便成了江西人的代名。（11月23日《萍乡报》李国全摘）
