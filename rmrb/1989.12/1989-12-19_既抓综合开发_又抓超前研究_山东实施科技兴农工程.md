Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 17th. People's Daily reporters Liu Deyu and Jia Jianzhou report: The five-day Shandong Provincial Rural Work Conference concluded today in Jinan. This was a mobilization and oath-taking meeting to seek agricultural products and benefits through science and technology. All regions in the province will, according to the deployment of the provincial Party Committee and the provincial government, vigorously and practically launch the "Science and Technology Revitalization of Agriculture Program."

This "Science and Technology Revitalization of Agriculture Program," which is based on existing conditions, requires minimal investment, and yields quick results, is the fruit of the labor of more than 150 experts over the past half year. According to its main content, people also refer to it as the "Three-Eight-Ten Program," which means: focusing on three aspects of advanced technology research to provide technological reserves for enhancing agricultural development potential; grasping eight major agricultural comprehensive technology developments to drive large-scale balanced increases in production; and organizing the promotion of ten aspects of major agricultural science and technology achievements to improve agricultural production technology levels.

The three aspects of advanced technology research are: focusing on grain, cotton, and oil crops for seed selection and matching cultivation, management, and comprehensive processing and utilization technologies; water resource development, protection, and drought-resistant water-saving technologies; and agricultural structure adjustment, appropriate scale management, and scientific management.

The eight major comprehensive technology developments are: developing 40 million mu of medium and low-yield fields along the Yellow River; developing 2.2 million mu of fields that can drive 11 million mu of high-yield fields; developing high-yield technologies for 400,000 mu of cotton, 500,000 mu of peanuts, and 500,000 mu of wheat-cotton double-cropping; developing mountain areas and the Yellow River Delta; developing dry farming in mountainous and hilly areas; developing three-dimensional, ecological agriculture in 29 different levels and types of development pilot projects; transforming 1 million mu of low-quality, low-yield orchards; and developing intensive, high-yield livestock and poultry farming technologies and major aquaculture products.

Organizing the promotion of ten aspects of science and technology achievements, such as crop seed purification and rejuvenation technology.

    既抓综合开发　又抓超前研究
    山东实施科技兴农工程
    本报济南12月17日电　新华社记者刘德玉、本报记者贾建舟报道：为期5天的山东省农村工作会议今天在济南结束。这是一次向科学技术要农产品、要效益的动员誓师大会，全省各地将按照省委和省政府的部署，大张旗鼓而又扎扎实实地铺开“科技兴农工程”。
    这项立足现有条件、投入少、见效快的“科技兴农工程”实施方案，是150多名专家近半年来的心血的结晶。按其主体内容，人们又将它称为“三八一○工程”，即：突出三个方面的超前技术研究，为增强农业发展后劲提供技术储备；抓好八大农业综合技术开发，带动大面积均衡增产；组织推广十个方面的重大农业科技成果，提高农业生产技术水平。
    超前技术研究的三个方面是：以粮棉油为重点的良种选育及配套栽培、管理、综合加工利用技术；水资源开发、保护及抗旱节水技术；农业结构调整、适度规模经营及科学管理。
    八大综合技术开发是：沿黄4000万亩中低产田开发；220万亩带动1100万亩吨粮田开发；40万亩棉花、50万亩花生、50万亩麦棉两熟的高产技术开发；山区和黄河三角洲区域开发；山丘旱薄地旱作农业开发；29个不同层次、不同类型开发试点的立体、生态农业开发；100万亩劣质低产果园改造；食草畜禽及主要水产品集约高产养殖技术开发。
    组织推广作物良种提纯及复壮技术等十个方面的科技成果。
