In late July, an urgent telegram was sent from the Shenyang Railway Bureau headquarters. With the sound of "click-click-clack," the message quickly spread across the 9,000 kilometers of railway lines under the bureau's jurisdiction, reaching over 830 stations, more than 200 passenger trains, and over 200 police stations and train security teams.

"The bureau has decided to launch a comprehensive campaign to clean up the cultural market and eliminate reactionary and pornographic books and audio-visual products across the entire bureau. All units must take immediate action..."

The order swiftly spread from the command center to the farthest reaches, and the entire bureau sprang into action: The bureau, divisions, and various stations established three-level leadership groups headed by key leaders to formulate specific action plans for the large-scale anti-pornography campaign. They formed a three-tiered defense line consisting of passenger transport, freight transport, and public security departments, focusing on inspections and blockades in trains, luggage rooms, and cargo handling areas. They also mobilized 2,500 people to form 667 inspection teams, who boarded trains, patrolled lines, entered stations, and took up positions.

The net was cast.

On August 2, the Longcheng Station luggage room received a shipment of a refrigerator. Station workers, while checking for packaging damage, discovered 8 pornographic videotapes and over 200 pornographic books hidden inside the refrigerator. They immediately sealed and handed the items over to the relevant departments for processing.

On August 24, on the 487th train from Yingkou to Longcheng, the train security officers discovered a batch of printed materials with excessive nude photos on the covers during a patrol. They immediately reported to the relevant departments, and all the materials were intercepted.

On the same day, the Guojiadian Station received 7 shipments of printed materials. After sampling inspections, 18 types of books totaling 2,940 were found in two shipments, of which 6 types were books banned by the government. After examination by relevant provincial departments, it was confirmed that 12 types of books totaling 2,581 were pornographic and illegal publications. The relevant departments are still investigating this case.

On October 18, at the Shenyang Station's Denglata Luggage Handling Office.

A man dressed as a farmer came to handle the shipment of 6 bags of printed materials, which caught the attention of Deputy Director Zhao Guocheng of the station police office.

"What are you shipping?"

"Books."

"What kind of books?"

"Legal ones."

Zhao Guocheng, together with the station luggage handlers, inspected the shipment and found 1,150 copies of "Dialogues on the Marriage Bed" inside the bags. He immediately took the man back to Shenyang for questioning.

Upon investigation, it was found that the man, Zhang Yinsuo, was a salesperson for an underground printing factory in a rural area of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, that printed illegal publications. This time, he came to the Northeast and, fearing that his shipment would be discovered at the Shenyang Station, secretly went to the outskirts of Denglata to ship the goods, but was still caught. He lamented, "The Northeast Railway is really formidable."

Deputy Secretary of the Shenyang Railway Bureau Party Committee, Ma Zengqing, said: "As an important channel for the circulation of various materials, the railway bears important responsibilities for the anti-pornography campaign. Since late July, the entire bureau has intercepted over 5,000 reactionary and pornographic books and over 500 pornographic videotapes; mobilized over 6,600 people to inspect 15,000 train carriages, removing over 11,000 pornographic drawings; and shut down 31 illegal bookstores and stalls. The bureau requires that cadres and the masses recognize that 'anti-pornography' is a necessity for upholding 'one central task and two basic points,' and is a struggle against corruption and anti-corruption, degeneration and anti-degeneration. They should actively participate in the 'anti-pornography' campaign."

On the 9,000 kilometers of railway lines under the jurisdiction of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, vigilant people with vigilant eyes are everywhere.

    警惕的眼睛
     ——记沈阳铁路局“扫黄”
    赵铁男
    7月下旬，一份标有“加急”字样的电报从沈阳铁路局机关发出，随着“嘀嘀嗒嗒”的无线电波声，迅速传遍全局纵横9000公里铁道线上的830多个车站，200多对旅客列车，200多个公安派出所、乘警队……
      “路局决定在全局打一场全面整顿文化市场，扫除反动、黄色书刊和音像制品的战役，各单位要立即行动……”
    指令迅速从神经中枢传到末梢，全局上下紧急行动起来：路局、分局及各站段建立了由主要领导负责的三级领导小组，制定了开展大规模扫黄的具体行动方案；组成了由客运、货运和公安部门组成的三道联网防线，确定从列车、行李房、货物处内查堵重点；抽调了2500多人，组成667个检查小组，上车、上线，进站、到位。
    网，撒开了。
    8月2日，长春站行李房到货一台电冰箱。车站工作人员在检查包装破损情况时，发现冰箱内夹带淫秽录像带8盘，黄色书刊200余册，当即予以封存，交有关部门处理。
    8月24日，营口开往长春的487次列车，乘警在巡视中发现一批印刷品中有封皮裸体照过多的书刊，当即报告有关部门，全部堵截。
    同一天，郭家店站收到7件印刷品货物。经抽样检查，在两件货物里发现的18种计2940本书刊中，有6种是政府明文规定的“禁书”。经省有关部门鉴定，确认该批货物中有12种计2581本书系黄色书刊和非法出版物。有关部门对这起案件仍在审理中。
    10月18日，沈阳站驻灯塔行李托运办事处。
    一个农民打扮的人前来办理6编织袋印刷品托运业务，引起了车站派出所副所长赵国成的警觉。
    “托运的什么货物？”
      “书刊。”
    “什么书刊？”
      “合法的。”
    赵国成会同车站行李员对该批货物进行检查，发现袋内装有《婚床上的对话》计1150册，当即将该人带回沈阳审查。
    经审查得知，该人叫张银锁，系河北省石家庄市农村一地下印刷非法出版物的工厂的推销员。这次到东北唯恐在沈阳站发货被发现，便偷偷跑到市郊灯塔去发运，结果还是束手被擒。他懊丧地说：“东北铁路真厉害。”
    沈阳铁路局党委副书记马增清介绍说：“铁路作为各种物资流通的重要渠道，对查黄扫黄工作负有重要职责。从7月下旬以来，全局已查堵反动、淫秽书刊5000余册，淫秽录像带500多盘；出动6600多人，清查了1.5万辆车厢，清除淫秽字画1.1万多处；取缔了31个违法经营售书厅、点。路局要求干部群众认识到
  ‘扫黄’是坚持‘一个中心，两个基本点’的需要，是腐蚀与反腐蚀、演变与反演变的斗争，自觉地参加‘扫黄’。”
    在沈阳铁路局管辖的9000公里的铁道线上，到处都是警惕的人们，警惕的眼睛。
