A Prodigal Returns to Show His Skills
— A Record of Professor Chen Mingzhe of Beijing Medical University Third Hospital

In May 1987, Chen Mingzhe bid farewell to his family who had settled in the United States and returned to Beijing Medical University Third Hospital, where he had worked for 20 years, to take up the position of Director of the Internal Medicine Department. Over the past two years, he and his colleagues in the Cardiovascular Disease Research Room have conducted research on interventional cardiology, which only emerged in the 1980s, and were the first to apply laser coronary angioplasty in domestic clinical practice.

Chen Mingzhe's achievements in his career have left renowned international cardiovascular disease experts Dr. Mason and Dr. Li Guozhen astonished.

Chen Mingzhe, who grew up in Hong Kong, returned to the mainland in 1954 to enroll in Beijing Medical University. After graduating, he was assigned to work in the Respiratory Specialty Group of the Internal Medicine Department at the Third Hospital of Beijing Medical University.

In 1979, with the opening of the country, Chen Mingzhe went to the United States to visit his elderly mother and two brothers who had become senior engineers. This gave him the opportunity to observe and understand the latest achievements of modern medicine in Western developed countries and the gaps between them and China.

A strong sense of national pride and the responsibility to catch up with the advanced level of world medical science drove him to focus on a subject that only a few major medical centers in the world dared to tackle—laser coronary angioplasty—and to pursue further studies in the United States.

Chen Mingzhe's journey of struggle began at a medical school located in the western United States. In less than a year, he had fully "digested" over 700 sets of English medical slides and passed the examination for a doctorate in medicine in the United States. Dr. Mason and Dr. Li Guozhen opened their research institutes and laboratories to Chen Mingzhe. After several years of unremitting efforts, he made a name for himself in the field of interventional cardiology, becoming a researcher, visiting professor, and deputy director of the Holton Laser Research Room at the Western Heart Research Institute in the United States. He has published more than 60 papers in top-tier professional journals such as the *American Heart Journal*.

"Although the conditions in the United States are good, it is not my homeland. My career is in China." After completing his studies, Chen Mingzhe, with the understanding of his mother, brothers, wife, children, and friends, returned to the land he deeply cherished in May 1987.

The working conditions at the Cardiovascular Disease Research Room of the Third Hospital were extremely primitive, with no suitable instruments or equipment and no experimental animals. Chen Mingzhe did not have time to wash off the dust of his journey and immediately threw himself into his work. Less than a month after his return, he successfully performed the first open-chest laser coronary angioplasty in China.

In November 1988, Chen Mingzhe and his colleagues successfully performed a percutaneous transluminal laser coronary angioplasty on a patient with complete occlusion of the right coronary artery. To celebrate this surgery, which achieved an international advanced level, Minister of Health Chen Minzhang specially wrote a letter to congratulate him. Now, he has successfully performed 21 cases of percutaneous or open-chest laser coronary angioplasty. In early July of this year, four heartfelt letters were sent from Chen Mingzhe to his colleagues studying in the United States across the Pacific. Soon, replies came, "Please rest assured, Dr. Chen, we will definitely return to China on schedule!" Because of the "common cause and common aspiration that binds us together." This is the firm response of the four overseas students.

Chen Mingzhe, who is in charge of scientific research, cherishes talent even more. He uses people according to their abilities and treats them sincerely, giving them both freedom and responsibility. Everyone strives for the common goal, and the spirit of each person's struggle and progress, as well as their contributions, can be fully realized.

He provided cooperation personnel and all possible support for doctors Guo Jingxuan and Mao Jieming, enabling them to complete their academic papers excellently. Han Qide and Wang Xian are talents recruited by Chen Mingzhe from other units. Chen Mingzhe arranged laboratories and research funds for them, allowing them to start work quickly. Han Qide completed 10 papers in less than a year.

Now, the Cardiovascular Disease Research Room is known as the "department that works without regard to life." In 1988 alone, it completed 37 papers, nearly twice the total number of papers from the previous five years.

    赤子归来显身手
    ——记北京医科大学第三医院教授陈明哲
    孙敬尧　王薇薇
    1987年5月，陈明哲再次辞别已定居美国的家人，只身回到了曾经工作过20年的北京医科大学第三医院，出任内科主任。两年来，他与心血管病研究室的同事，对80年代才发展起来的介入性心脏医学进行研究，率先将激光冠状动脉成形术应用于国内临床。
    陈明哲在事业上取得的成功，使国际著名心血管病专家梅森博士和李国祯博士惊叹不已。
    在香港长大的陈明哲，1954年回到内地投考北京医科大学。毕业后，他被分配到北医三院内科呼吸专业组工作。
    1979年，国门大开，陈明哲去美国探望年迈的母亲和两个成为高级工程师的弟弟。这使他有机会考察了解西方发达国家现代医学最新成就和我们的差距。
    强烈的民族自尊心和赶超世界医学科学先进水平的责任感，使他瞄准了那个在世界上只有几家大的医学中心才敢问津的课题——激光冠状动脉成形术，留美深造。
    陈明哲的拚搏之途是从坐落在美国西部的一所医学院起步的。不到一年时间，他就全部“消化”了700多套英文医学幻灯片，通过了美国医学博士学位的考试。梅森博士和李国祯博士向陈明哲敞开了自己的研究所和实验室。经过几年的不懈努力，他在介入性心脏医学领域一鸣惊人，成为美国西部心脏病研究所研究员、客座教授、屋仑激光研究室副主任，先后在《美国心脏杂志》等世界一流专业杂志上发表过60余篇论文。
    “美国的条件很好，但这里毕竟不是我的祖国。我的事业在中国。”学成之后，陈明哲带着母亲、弟弟和妻儿以及朋友们的理解之情，1987年5月，回到了他深深眷恋的华夏大地。
    三院心血管病研究室的工作条件极为简陋，没有适用的仪器设备，没有实验动物。陈明哲顾不上洗去旅途的风尘，便一头扎进工作中。回国不到1个月，他便成功地做了我国首例开胸激光冠脉成形术。
    1988年11月，陈明哲和他的同事又为一例右冠状动脉完全堵塞的患者，成功地施行了经皮穿刺冠状动脉激光成形术。为了这一国际先进水平的手术成功，卫生部部长陈敏章特意写信向他祝贺。现在，他已成功地施行了21例经皮或开胸激光冠状动脉成形术。今年7月初，4封情深意切的信件从陈明哲手中发出，飞向正在太平洋彼岸深造的同事们手中。不久，回信来了，“请陈大夫放心，我们一定如期归国！”因为有“使我们凝聚到一起”的“共同的事业，共同的志向”。这就是4位游子坚定的回声。
    担负科研领导责任的陈明哲，倍加珍惜人才。对周围同事，他量才所用，以诚相待，既放手又负责。大家既为共同目标努力，每个人拚搏进取，多出成果，多作贡献的精神又都能得到发挥。
    他给郭静萱和毛节明两位医生配备合作人员，提供一切能够给予的支持，使他们出色地完成了学术论文。韩起德和王宪是陈明哲从外单位招聘来的人才。陈明哲为他们安排了实验室和科研基金，使他们很快开展工作。韩起德不到一年就完成10篇论文。
    如今的心血管病研究室，被人称为“工作起来不要命的科室”。仅1988年就完成论文37篇，是前5年论文总数的近2倍。
