Edition: 1

	Editor's Note: After achieving initial results and experience in China's agricultural comprehensive development, the state's key support for development has now expanded to some economically disadvantaged but potentially developing regions in the central and western parts of the country. This is an important deployment in China's economic development layout, which is of great significance for promoting the overall economic development of these regions.

	Comrade Tian Jiyun recently inspected the agricultural development situation in Guizhou Province and gave an important speech. This speech not only has important guiding significance for the agricultural comprehensive development in Guizhou Province, but also for the entire agricultural development, especially for some economically disadvantaged regions in the central and western parts of the country. The following is a summary of the speech.

	I came this time mainly to study the issue of agricultural development in Guizhou. During the few days of inspection, I walked, observed, and held discussions along the way, deepening my understanding of the agricultural situation in Guizhou. Below, I will mainly discuss five aspects of the issue:

	One, Impressions of the Rural Situation and Agricultural Production in Guizhou

	I have two impressions of the rural situation and agricultural production in Guizhou.

	The first impression is that the rural situation in Guizhou is as good as the rest of the country. First, the rural areas in Guizhou are very stable. The broad masses of peasants genuinely support the Communist Party, support the line, principles, and policies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and support the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Second, the spirit of cadres at all levels is excellent. From the province to the prefecture, county, and down to the grassroots level, the spirit of the cadres is indeed good. Cadres at all levels are seriously implementing the Party's policies in rural areas, have a clear guiding ideology for agricultural development, and, especially through in-depth propaganda and implementation of the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, have gradually clarified some confused understandings and eliminated some unstable factors in rural areas. Third, the agricultural production situation is developing in a good direction, and the momentum is quite good. Cadres and the masses have seen the difficulties in developing agricultural production, but more importantly, they have seen the potential and hope. Although the grain production in the province this year did not reach the highest historical level, it increased by more than 10% compared to last year, making it the second-highest yield year in history. Summer grain production exceeded the highest historical level. The people have confidence, which is precious. As long as there is confidence, there will be ways; when the masses have the spirit, it will be beneficial to overcome various difficulties and strive for the better. The Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government timely conveyed the basic principles and policies of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the broad cadres and masses, which is completely correct. This way, the overall situation is stabilized, the hearts of the peasants are stabilized, and agricultural production will not encounter major problems. Generally speaking, as long as our policies are conveyed to the grassroots cadres and to the townships, they will reach the masses.

	The second impression is that it is not easy for Guizhou's agricultural production to break through the stagnation of the past few years and achieve a new breakthrough, reaching a new level. Of course, there are many favorable conditions, but we must fully recognize the difficulties. It can be summarized in a few words: there are difficulties, there is potential, there is experience, and there is hope. The difficulties mainly lie in the fact that there are many people, little land, high mountains, steep slopes, thin soil, severe ecological degradation, and serious soil erosion. Guizhou loses a large amount of soil every year. The "rockification" of Guizhou is indeed serious. Some cracks in the rocks have a little soil and can grow a little bit; some cracks in the rocks have no soil at all and are as clean as a toothbrush; some are entire rocky mountains, strange in shape, like carved ones. If long-term measures are not taken to fundamentally treat soil erosion, the vicious cycle of Guizhou's agriculture will be difficult to control, not only failing to solve the current food problem but also endangering the survival of future generations. The land resources in Guizhou are limited, and the population is still increasing. The biggest constraint on the development of Guizhou's agriculture must be faced. This is the first point.

	Secondly, Guizhou's agriculture has potential. Among the 28 million mu of arable land in the province, only 6.8 million mu are irrigated, and the average yield per mu of this part of the land has reached 800 jin, while the average yield of general land is less than 400 jin, with a significant gap. If the stable high-yield fields are doubled to 14 million mu, with an increase of 200 jin per mu, that would be an increase of 2.8 billion jin. At the same time, through scientific farming, improving varieties, improving soil quality, fertilizing the land, scientific cultivation, and implementing intercropping, relay cropping, and mixed cropping, some yields can also be increased. In addition, the existing 6.8 million mu of irrigated land will also continue to increase production. In this way, it is possible to achieve self-sufficiency or basic self-sufficiency in grain, greatly reducing the need for imports. Of course, this does not mean that it will be achieved in the next year or two, but rather through several years of efforts, gradually achieving it.

	Thirdly, Guizhou has many creations suitable for local conditions in agricultural development and many good experiences. For example, in the field of agricultural technology, Li Guilian's promotion of early-maturing vegetables and film mulching in Luodian County, Guizhou, has been praised nationwide. Renhuai County's dryland strip rotation system has been implemented on 90,000 mu, with an average grain yield of 1,000-1,400 jin per mu, and the highest reaching 1,700 jin, which is not simple! The two terraces in Zhijin County are similar. These methods are effective. Measures such as strip sowing, intercropping, mixed cropping, promotion of high-yield varieties, film mulching, application of green manure, and straw return are not mysterious and can be promoted on a large scale. Many places in Guizhou can take this road. If combined with water irrigation, such as the small water pits in Xifeng, and made larger, with the top sealed and water pipes inserted for sprinkler irrigation, the water problem for dryland crops can be solved, which is also suitable for the characteristics of Guizhou's mountainous areas. Guizhou's rainfall is not low, but most of the rainwater is lost. It is necessary to study the utilization of natural water well. Large water conservancy projects should be built where conditions permit, but medium and small projects, including small water pits, should be built more. This way, less money is spent, and the results are faster and more practical. The experience of treating soil erosion and comprehensive development in the Bijie area is good. They combine afforestation, small watershed treatment, intercropping of grain and trees, and the development of economic crops. Some places have also cultivated artificial grass. Guizhou has many good experiences created by itself that are suitable for local conditions. For Guizhou, as long as the potential is fully tapped, the experience is promoted, and the spirit of the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is continued, it is completely possible to develop agriculture.

	Two, Why Guizhou Must Carry Out Comprehensive Agricultural Development

	Since liberation, the Party and the government have led the broad masses of peasants to develop agricultural production, making great efforts and achieving great results. From the national perspective, the basic problem of feeding 11 billion people has been solved; from the perspective of Guizhou, the basic problem of feeding more than 30 million people has been solved. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, due to the correctness of the Party's policies, the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of peasants have been fully mobilized, coupled with other factors, so Guizhou's agriculture, like the rest of the country, has reached a new level since 1978. Guizhou's grain production has increased from about 11 billion jin in 1978 to about 13 billion jin now. Economic crops and diversified operations have also developed significantly, especially tobacco, which has developed the fastest and has become a major economic pillar of Guizhou. Guizhou, like the rest of the country, has seen significant development in agricultural production; at the same time, it faces the problem of agricultural stagnation. Currently, Guizhou's grain production is roughly at the level of 13 billion jin. If the weather is good, it can increase by 1-2 billion jin, but if the weather does not cooperate, it can decrease by several billion jin or even 10 billion jin. If the yield increases, the days are better, but if the yield decreases, the days are worse, and if the yield decreases continuously, the days are even worse. Therefore, whether from the perspective of further economic development or from the perspective of further improving the lives of the masses; whether from the perspective of solving the food problem of the newly increased population or from the perspective of the long-term stability and social stability of Guizhou, it is necessary for Guizhou's agriculture to develop and reach a new level. If Guizhou's agriculture remains at the current level for a long time, it will be a problem for one year, but it will be a big problem if it continues for a long time. There are two problems: first, the grain source is difficult to solve, relying on imports requires foreign exchange, and relying on grain from other provinces, will other provinces have grain to give you? Second, it is constrained by financial resources. A large amount of grain is imported, can the financial resources bear it? To be honest, Guizhou now imports 2 billion jin of grain every year, and the financial burden is already heavy. If tobacco is not planted to plant grain, your financial resources will collapse immediately. If tobacco is squeezed out to plant grain, wages cannot be paid, and the economy will collapse. This road cannot be taken. Therefore, I believe that the only feasible way is to carry out agricultural comprehensive development, gradually improve the self-sufficiency level of grain, and gradually reduce the import of grain from other places. Currently, the understanding of this issue is consistent from top to bottom and left to right in Guizhou. The understanding that the whole Party should engage in agriculture, various industries should support agriculture, and increase investment in agriculture is also consistent. This provides a good social environment for getting out of the agricultural predicament and gradually breaking through the stagnant situation. Guizhou's agricultural comprehensive development is imperative.

	Three, What Path Should Guizhou's Agricultural Comprehensive Development Take

	First, Guizhou's agricultural development should mainly take the path of transforming medium and low-yield fields, gradually building a batch of stable high-yield fields. The national agricultural development is to focus on transforming medium and low-yield fields, and Guizhou cannot focus on "key points" but should focus on "mainly." I am inclined not to generally propose reclamation, as this can easily lead to the misunderstanding of destroying forests and grasslands to plant grain, exacerbating soil erosion. In many places in Guizhou, crops have been planted to the top of the mountains. If there are still barren hills and slopes, they should mainly be planted with grass and trees, including economic forests, and some barren water can be developed for aquaculture. Do not think that once development is mentioned, it is reclamation. Guizhou should mainly transform medium and low-yield fields and absolutely should not continue the path of destroying forests and grasslands to plant grain. Attention should be paid to places with conditions to build stable high-yield fields, adopting comprehensive treatment measures for mountains, water, fields, soil, forests, and roads to create a good ecological environment for building stable high-yield fields, so that they can be consolidated. If comprehensive treatment measures are not taken, stable high-yield fields cannot be maintained. The terrace I saw in Zhijin is built on the mountain by planting trees and preventing mudslides, so the terrace is maintained and becomes a stable high-yield field. If the surrounding ecological environment is not improved, only high-yield fields are built there, and they will be destroyed by heavy rain. If Guizhou strengthens the construction of stable high-yield fields, with an average of 5 mu of stable high-yield fields per agricultural population, transforming hundreds of thousands of mu each year, from now until the end of 1995, the province will have 14 million mu, plus the surface also needs to be developed, and family planning work needs to be strengthened, Guizhou's grain will be basically self-sufficient, and even if a little is imported, it will be for variety adjustment. I believe that by taking such a measure, not only can Guizhou's agricultural development be promoted and the momentum of agricultural development be enhanced, but it is also beneficial to enhance the momentum of Guizhou's overall economic development.

	Second, basin treatment should be carried out in a planned manner. The treatment of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, including the Wujiang and other large and small basins, can create conditions for improving Guizhou's ecological environment and building stable high-yield fields. This is a large systematic project, and the province should plan it uniformly, concentrate relatively, highlight key points, and implement it in steps. It should be done piece by piece and not try to eat a "big fat man" at once. The treatment of the Yangtze River basin involves five or six counties in Guizhou, and the investment that has been allocated for this part, as well as the funds from the World Bank aid project, must be used well and used to achieve results.

	Third, trees and grass should be planted. For those steep slopes that have been reclaimed, for those slopes with a gradient of more than 25 degrees, forest-grain intercropping, forest-fruit intercropping, and forest-grass intercropping can be carried out first. This way, it does not affect the current food problem of the farmers, and it also creates conditions for complete withdrawal in the future. It is not feasible to withdraw all at once, and we should consider the interests of the farmers. Some places have lessons in this regard. The problem of seedlings should be solved, and a batch of seedling farms should be established with planning, with the state providing support, and seedlings should be sold to farmers at a preferential price. At the same time, it should be clearly announced that whoever plants it manages it and owns it. The masses should be organized and mobilized to green the mountain tops and ridges. This way, not only water and soil loss are prevented, but water is also conserved. Do not remove the grass, and let the grass and trees grow. This can retain water and soil. As long as this is persisted, the situation can be completely changed.

	Fourth, economic crops and diversified operations should be actively developed, especially by vigorously promoting agricultural science and technology to improve yield and product quality, and using the income from diversified operations to increase accumulation and provide economic support for agricultural development.

	The above four items have both differences and connections. It is necessary to emphasize that our agricultural development must be comprehensive development.

	Four, Measures for Agricultural Comprehensive Development

	After the principles of agricultural comprehensive development are clear, measures must be taken. First, leadership should pay attention, and the main leaders should take the lead. This also includes taking the lead in development and poverty alleviation. Many problems can be solved as long as the leading comrades pay attention, ask about them frequently, and take the lead. Second, startup funds must be solved. I fully agree with Guizhou Province's decision to set aside a sum of money to establish an agricultural development fund. The State Council will also take various measures to support Guizhou's agricultural development. The money from the central government, plus part of Guizhou Province, is a considerable figure and can form a fund. This money must be used well. A considerable part of it should be gradually recovered and used in a rolling manner. Some development projects have a short cycle and good benefits, and they can be recovered in two or three years, and some can be recovered in the same year. The investment of funds should be relatively concentrated, arranging this piece this year and that piece next year, and absolutely preventing "scattering pepper." Either do not invest, or if you invest, solve the problem. The arrangement of funds must have a sequence, first doing those with good conditions and quick results, first easy then difficult, and arranging in order. The whole country started from the relatively good conditions of the Huanghuaihai Plain. This is done to quickly let everyone see the results, potential, and possibilities of development. Of course, it is now time to support economically disadvantaged areas. As long as the agricultural development of this part of the area is up, the reduction of grain imports is also supporting the whole country. Third, support should be given in terms of tax, loans, and other policies. Fourth, a strong working organization is needed. This organization is best under the leadership of the provincial government, a comprehensive organization, not speaking from the standpoint of any department, but speaking from a higher position, from the standpoint of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, overseeing the overall situation, and assisting the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government in unified organization, management, and coordination of the comprehensive agricultural development work in the province. This organization should manage all the funds from various channels used for agricultural development, arrange them in a unified manner, and the funds should not be divided by department or layer by layer, but should be invested by project. Otherwise, it may lead to the situation of feeding people, buying cars, and building houses, resulting in no money for agricultural development. The personnel of this organization should be administrative staff, not eating the development fund, and not turning it into an economic organization of an enterprise nature.

	Five, Several Issues to Note at Present

	First, propaganda should be strengthened to further stabilize people's minds. The overall situation in rural Guizhou is good, but there are also many concerns at the grassroots level, and farmers also have some worries. The broad masses of cadres and the masses have a common wish to stabilize the Party's rural policies. Party committees and governments at all levels should quickly convey the relevant spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to stabilize the minds of the peasants and develop agriculture.

	Second, the problem of funds should be solved. The province should do its best to raise a part of the funds to solve the funds needed for the purchase of agricultural products. This year, some places have had a bumper harvest, and farmers are willing to sell more grain, and as much purchased grain as possible should be purchased. Financial departments should closely cooperate, improve services, actively do a good job in fund circulation, and further promote the development of the local economy.

	Third, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants should be protected. During this trip to Zunyi and Bijie, I found that there are still some problems in the purchase of agricultural products: some places have grain but do not buy it, some places have tobacco but do not buy it, and some places have rapeseed but do not buy it. This directly relates to the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants and should be properly solved. Some places reflect that agricultural products are purchased with IOUs, and efforts should be made to redeem them as soon as possible. Some agricultural products are temporarily abundant, and prices fall sharply, and a protective price should be set.

	Fourth, the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres should be protected. Grassroots cadres, including village cadres, are mostly good, and those who violate laws and disciplines are extremely few. Along the way, I have been talking about this: from an overall perspective, the basic aspects, mainstream, achievements, and contributions of grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres to the state must be affirmed. Grassroots cadres are indeed very hardworking. The Party's rural policies rely on them to be propagated and implemented, and the Party's various tasks in rural areas rely on them to be completed. They work tirelessly on the front line all year round, playing an important role, especially when facing various disasters, their role is particularly prominent. In dealing with grassroots cadres, the principle of seeking truth from facts should be adhered to, solving whatever problems there are, solving method problems with methods, solving style problems with style, and solving law and discipline problems with law and discipline.

	I firmly believe that although Guizhou's agriculture has difficulties, it has potential and hope. As long as correct principles, policies, and measures are taken, and everyone works together, strives hard, and works hard for several years, Guizhou's agriculture will have a new breakthrough and reach a new level.

    关于搞好贵州农业综合开发的几个问题
    田纪云
    编者按　我国农业综合开发，在取得初步成效和经验之后，现在国家重点扶持的开发范围已向经济比较困难、但有发展潜力的中西部的一些地区扩展。这是我国经济发展格局上的一项重要部署，对推动这些地区整个经济的发展，具有十分重要的意义。
    田纪云同志最近到贵州省考察了该省的农业开发情况，并作了重要讲话。这篇讲话，不仅对贵州省的农业综合开发，而且对整个农业开发、特别是中西部一些经济比较困难地区的农业综合开发，具有重要的指导作用。现摘要刊登。
    我这次来主要是研究贵州农业开发问题。在几天的考察中，一路上，边走、边看、边座谈，加深了对贵州农业情况的认识。下面我主要讲五个方面的问题：
    一、对贵州农村形势和农业生产的印象
    我对贵州农村形势和农业生产有两个印象。
    第一个印象，贵州农村形势同全国一样，是很好的。一是贵州农村人心非常安定。广大农民群众真心实意拥护共产党，拥护党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，拥护十三届五中全会的《决定》。二是各级干部精神面貌很好。从省到地、县，一直到基层，干部的精神面貌确实好。各级干部对党在农村的方针政策，都是认真贯彻执行的，对农业发展的指导思想比较明确，特别是通过深入宣传、贯彻十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策和十三届五中全会的《决定》，逐步澄清了一些糊涂认识，消除了农村出现的某些不稳定因素。三是农业生产形势正向好的方向发展，势头是不错的。干部群众看到了发展农业生产存在的困难，但更重要的是看到了潜力和希望所在。今年全省粮食产量虽然没有达到历史最高水平，但比去年增产一成以上，是历史上第二个高产年，夏粮超过了历史最高水平。人民有信心，这一条是可贵的。只要有信心，就会有办法；群众有了劲头，就有利于克服各种困难，向好的方面争取。贵州省委、省政府对党中央、国务院的基本方针、基本政策，适时地向广大干部、群众传达，这是完全正确的。这样做，就稳住了大局，稳住了农民的心，使农业生产不致于出现大的问题。一般讲，我们的政策只要传达到了基层干部，到了乡镇，就到了群众。
    第二个印象，贵州农业生产要突破这几年的徘徊，有一个新的突破，再上一个新台阶，难度不小。当然，有利条件也很多，但要充分认识难度。可以用这么几个字来概括我对贵州农业的看法：有困难，有潜力，有经验，有希望。困难，主要是人多，地少，山高，坡陡，地薄，生态环境恶化，水土流失严重。贵州一年要流走大量的泥土。贵州“石化”确实很严重。有的石头缝里有点土，还能长出一点东西；有的石头缝里一点土也没有，和刷过的牙齿一样干净；有的是整片石山，奇形怪状，像雕刻过的一样。如果对水土流失不采取长远措施，从根本上治理，贵州农业的恶性循环就难以遏制，不仅不能解决现在的吃饭问题，还将危及子孙后代的生存。贵州的土地资源有限，人口还在不断增加。贵州农业发展最大的制约因素，必须正视。这是其一。
    其二，贵州农业发展有潜力。全省2800万亩耕地中，保灌田只有680万亩，这部分田土平均亩产已达800斤，一般的田土亩产还不到400斤，悬殊很大。如果稳产高产田再增加1倍，达到1400万亩，每亩增产粮食200斤，那就增产28亿斤。同时在面上，通过科学种田，改良品种，改善土质，培肥地力，科学栽培，实行复种、间作、套种，也会提高一部分产量。另外，已有680万亩保灌田也会继续增产。这样，就有可能做到粮食自给或基本自给，大大减少调入。当然，不是指在明年后年就达到，而是经过几年的努力，逐步达到。
    其三，贵州在发展农业上，有许多适合本地情况的创造，有许多好的经验。如在科技兴农方面，李桂莲在贵州罗甸县推广早熟蔬菜、地膜覆盖，在全国都受到称赞。仁怀县的旱地分带轮作多熟制搞了9万亩，粮食平均亩产1000—1400斤，高的达1700斤，这不简单啊！织金县的两个坝子也是类似的做法。这些办法都是行之有效的。像条播、间作、套种、推广良种、地膜覆盖、增施绿肥、秸秆还田等措施，并不神秘，都可以大面积推广。贵州相当多的地方都可以走这条路子。如果再加上?水灌溉，如息烽小水窖，再搞大一点，上面封了口，插入水管就可以搞喷灌，解决旱地作物的用水问题，这也适合贵州山区的特点。贵州的降雨量并不低，但这些雨水大多流走了。要很好地研究一下对天然水的利用问题。要搞水利工程，有条件当然要上大的水利工程，但中小型的工程包括小水窖要多搞。这样花钱少，见效快，最现实。毕节地区治理水土流失，搞综合开发的经验很好，他们把植树造林、小流域治理、林粮间作和发展经济作物结合起来，有的地方还搞了人工培植牧草。贵州有许多自己创造的适合本地情况的好经验。对贵州来讲，只要把潜力充分挖掘出来，把经验推而广之，继续执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策和十三届五中全会《决定》的精神，坚定不移地沿着这条路子走下去，把农业搞上去，是完全有可能的。
    二、为什么贵州必须进行农业综合发展
    解放以来，党和政府领导广大农民发展农业生产，付出了极大的努力，取得了巨大的成绩。从全国来讲，基本解决了11亿人口的吃饭问题；从贵州来讲，基本解决了3000多万人的吃饭问题。尤其是党的十一届三中全会以后，由于党的政策正确，充分调动了广大农民的生产积极性和主动性，加上其他因素，所以，贵州的农业也同全国一样，在1978年的水平上登上了一个新台阶。贵州粮食产量从1978年的110亿斤左右，上升到现在的130亿斤左右，经济作物、多种经营也有很大的发展，特别是烤烟发展得最快，成为贵州的一大经济支柱。贵州同全国一样，农业生产有了一个较大的发展；同时又面临着一个农业徘徊的问题。目前贵州的粮食产量大体停留在130亿斤左右的水平上，风调雨顺增产一、二十亿斤，老天爷不帮忙就减产几亿斤、十来亿斤。增产日子就好过一点，减产就不好过，连续减产日子就更不好过。所以，无论是从经济的进一步发展，还是从群众生活的进一步改善来考虑；无论是从解决新增人口的吃饭问题，还是从贵州的长治久安和社会安定来考虑，都要求贵州的农业不能长期停留在现有的水平上，必须有所发展，再攀一个新台阶。如果贵州农业长期停留在现有水平上，一年可以，长期下去，就会出问题。有两个问题：一是粮源不好解决，靠进口需要外汇，靠从外省调进，人家的人口也在增加，耕地也在减少，有没有粮调给你？二是受到财力限制，大量调进粮食，你财政负不负担得起？老实讲，贵州现在一年调进20亿斤粮食，财政负担是够重的了。如果为了种粮不种烤烟，你们的财政马上就要垮下去。挤掉烤烟种粮，工资没有发的，经济也垮下去了。这条路子也不能走。所以，我认为，唯一可行的路子是，进行农业综合开发，逐步提高粮食自给水平，逐步减少外地粮食的调入。现在贵州上下左右对这个问题的认识是一致的。要全党办农业，各行各业支援农业，增加对农业的投入，这个认识也是一致的。这就为摆脱农业的困境，逐步突破徘徊的局面，提供了一个好的社会环境。贵州的农业综合开发势在必行。
    三、贵州的农业综合开发应走什么路子
    一是贵州的农业开发主要应走改造中低产田土的路子，逐步建设一批稳产高产田土。全国的农业开发，是提重点走改造中低产田的路子，贵州不能提“重点”，而是“主要”。我倾向不要笼统地提开荒，这样容易造成毁林、毁草种粮的错觉，加剧水土流失。贵州不少地方，庄稼已种到山顶上去了。如果还有荒山荒坡，主要是种草种树，包括经济林，还有些荒水可发展养殖业。不要认为一提开发就是开荒。贵州主要是改造中低产田土，绝不能再继续走毁林毁草种粮的路子。要把注意力放在那些有条件建设稳产高产田土的地方，采取山、水、田、土、林、路综合治理的措施，为建设稳产高产田土创造良好的生态环境，使之能够得以巩固。如不采取综合治理的措施，稳产高产田土就保不住。我在织金看的那个坝子，就是在山上植树造林，制止了泥石流，这个坝子才得以保住，变成了稳产高产田土。如果不改善周围生态环境，在那里只搞高产田，遇到大雨就毁于一旦。如果贵州加强稳产高产田土建设，农业人口人均搞5分稳产高产田土，每年改造百把万亩，从现在起到1995年末，全省就搞到1400万亩，再加上面上也要搞，计划生育工作要加强，贵州粮食就有可能基本自给，即使调进一点，也是品种调剂。我认为采取这样一个措施，不仅可以促进贵州农业发展，增强农业发展后劲，而且有利于增强贵州整个经济发展的后劲。
    二是要有计划地进行流域治理。对长江上游，包括乌江等大小流域进行治理，可以为改善贵州的生态环境，建设稳产高产田土创造条件。这是一个大的系统工程，省里要统一规划，相对集中，突出重点，分步实施。要一块一块地搞，不要想一口吃个“大胖子”。对长江流域的治理，涉及到贵州的五六个县，已经下达的这部分投资，以及世界银行援助项目的钱，一定要用好，用出效益。
    三是要种树种草。对那些陡坡开荒的地方，对那些25度以上的坡耕地，可以先搞林粮间作，林果间作，林草间作。这样既不影响当前农民的吃饭问题，又为今后的完全退耕创造了条件。一下子退下来不行，我们要为农民的切身利益着想。有的地方已有这方面的教训。要解决树苗问题，就要有计划地办好一批育苗场，国家要给予扶持，树苗以优惠的价格卖给农民。同时要明确宣布，谁栽谁管谁有。要组织发动群众把山头土坎绿化起来。这样既防止了水土流失，又涵养了水份。不要铲草皮，草树都要让它生长，可以保持水土。只要这样坚持干下去，就完全可以改变面貌。
    四是要积极发展经济作物和多种经营，特别要通过大力推广农业科学技术，提高单产，提高产品质量，用多种经营的收入增加积累，为农业开发提供经济支撑。
    上述四项，既有区别，又有联系。需要强调的是，我们的农业开发必须是综合开发。
    四、农业综合开发的措施
    农业综合开发的方针明确以后，还要解决措施问题。第一，是领导重视，主要领导要亲自抓。这里也包括要抓开发扶贫。许多问题领导同志重视，经常过问，亲自抓一抓，问题就好解决了。第二，要解决启动资金。贵州省下决心拿出一笔钱建立农业发展基金，我非常赞成。国务院也将采取多种措施支持贵州的农业开发。中央给贵州的钱，加上贵州省的部分，就是一个不小的数字，可以形成一个基金。一定要用好这笔钱。其中有相当部分，要陆续收回，滚动使用。有些开发项目周期短、效益好，两三年就可以收回，有的当年就可收回。资金投入要相对集中，今年安排这几片，明年安排那几片，千万防止“撒胡椒面”。要么不投入，要投入就要解决问题。资金安排一定要有先有后，先搞条件好、见效快的，先易后难，按次序安排。全国就是从条件较好的黄淮海平原搞起的。这样做，就是为了尽快让大家看到开发的效果、潜力和可能性。当然，现在到了扶持经济较困难地区的时候了。只要这部分地区的农业开发上去了，减少了粮食调入，也就是支持了全国。第三，在税收、贷款等政策方面给予扶持。第四，要有一个强有力的办事机构。这个机构最好是在省政府领导下的综合机构，不是站在哪一个部门的立场上说话，而是要站得更高一些，站在省委、省政府的立场说话，纵观全局，协助省委、省政府统一组织、管理、协调全省的农业综合开发工作。这个机构要把各个渠道用于农业开发的资金统管起来，统筹安排，资金不能按部门切块，也不能层层切块，而是要按项目投入。否则，就有可能出现一养人、二买车、三盖房子，弄得农业开发反而没有钱。这个机构的人员要是行政编制，不能吃开发基金，也不能办成企业性质的经济组织。
    五、当前需要注意的几个问题
    第一，要加强宣传，进一步稳定人心。贵州农村总的情况是很好的，但下面担心的问题也不少，农民也还有一些忧虑。广大干部群众都有一个共同心愿，希望稳定党的农村政策。各级党委和政府要尽快把十三届五中全会的有关精神传达下去，以利稳住农民的心，把农业搞上去。
    第二，要解决好资金问题。省里要想方设法筹措一部分资金，解决农产品收购所需的资金。今年有的地方丰收了，农民愿意多卖粮，要尽可能多收购一点议价粮。金融部门要密切配合，改善服务，积极做好资金融通工作，进一步促进地方经济的发展。
    第三，要保护广大农民的生产积极性。我这次在遵义、毕节两地发现农产品收购中还存在一些问题：有些地方有粮不收，有的地方有烟不收，有油菜籽不收。这直接关系到广大农民的生产积极性，要妥善解决好。还有的地方反映，收购农产品打白条，也要设法尽快兑现。有的农产品一时多了，价格落得很厉害，要确定一个保护价。
    第四，要保护基层干部的积极性。基层干部包括村干部，绝大部分是好的，违法乱纪的是极少数。一路上我都在讲，从总体上看，对农村基层组织和基层干部必须肯定他们的基本方面，肯定他们的主流，肯定他们的成绩，肯定他们对国家所作出的贡献。基层干部确实很辛苦。党的农村政策要靠他们去宣传贯彻，党在农村的各项任务要靠他们去完成。他们常年累月奔波在第一线，发挥着重要作用，特别是在遇到各种灾难的时候，这种作用尤为突出。对待基层干部，要坚持实事求是的原则，有什么问题就解决什么问题，是方法问题就解决方法问题，是作风问题就解决作风问题，是违法乱纪问题就解决违法乱纪问题。
    我深信，贵州的农业虽有困难，但是有潜力，有希望，只要采取正确的方针、政策和措施，齐心协力，艰苦奋斗，扎扎实实地奋斗若干年，贵州农业有一个新的突破，攀上一个新台阶，是完全可能的。
