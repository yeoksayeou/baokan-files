The first large-scale heavy oil catalytic cracking combined unit, which was built using advanced refining technology imported from abroad, has recently been completed and started production at the Changling Refining and Chemical Plant in Hunan. Trial runs have shown that the technology, equipment, and processes of this unit have reached international advanced levels.

This unit, with an annual processing capacity of 1 million tons of heavy oil, is one of the key projects of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for the China National Petroleum Corporation. The investment was 140 million yuan, and the construction period was completed one year ahead of schedule.

This refining unit, which primarily processes heavy oil, consists of integrated operational units such as catalytic cracking, gasoline desulfurization and dehydration, liquid hydrocarbon, dry gas desulfurization, gas fractionation, and energy recovery.

    重油催化联合装置投产
    新华社长沙12月18日电　（通讯员王春芳、记者易凯林）我国从国外引进先进炼油技术建成的第一套大型重油催化裂化联合装置，日前在湖南长岭炼油化工厂建成投产。经过试车表明，这套装置的工艺、设备、技术都达到了国际先进水平。
    这套年处理量为100万吨重油的催化裂化联合装置，是中国石化总公司“七五”计划重点项目之一，投资1.4亿元，建设工期比计划提前一年竣工。
    这套以重油为主要加工原料的炼油装置，由催化裂化、汽油脱硫醇、液态烃、干气脱硫、气体分馏、能量回收等操作单元配套成龙。
