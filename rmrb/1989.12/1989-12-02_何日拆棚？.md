    When Will the Sheds Be Demolished?
    Some construction teams in Beijing, after taking on projects, often encroach upon green spaces and sidewalks for their own convenience, erecting sheds at will for storing materials, housing workers, and setting up offices. Some of these sheds remain even after the projects are completed, sometimes serving as semi-permanent facilities for the construction teams. For a long time, relevant authorities have not conducted any inspections or rectifications, leading to numerous safety hazards for urban traffic and residential areas.

    For instance, on the sidewalk opposite the Overseas Service Department on Dongdajie in Chaoyang District, a construction team from a restaurant has built a shed, forcing pedestrians to walk on the roadway.

    何日拆棚？
    北京市有些工程队承包了一些工程后，为了自家施工方便，往往挤占绿地、人行道，随意搭起工棚堆料、住人、办公。有的在工程结束后也不拆除，甚至作为半永久性的工程队用房。长期以来，不见有关单位对这一现象清查整顿，给城市交通和住宅区带来诸多不安全因素。
    在朝阳区东大桥路出国人员服务部马路对面的人行道，被一家饭店的建筑队盖了工棚，使得行人只得步入机动车道，就是一例。
