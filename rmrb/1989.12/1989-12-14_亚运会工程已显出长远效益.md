The construction of the Beijing Asian Games projects is still underway, but their long-term benefits are already becoming evident. Today, the management of the Asian Games Village Service Center signed rental agreements with two major international conferences.

After the Beijing Asian Games, the main buildings of the Asian Games Village will be converted into the Beijing International Conference Center. According to the contracts signed today, the 52nd International Electrotechnical Commission Conference and the 12th International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics Conference will be held in this center in the coming years. Each of these conferences will have over a thousand participants from more than 40 countries and regions.

During the signing ceremony, the conference organizers stated that the choice of the Asian Games Village as the venue was made after international organization officials conducted on-site inspections. This indicates that the construction of the 11th Asian Games projects has improved the long-standing lack of internationally standard conference facilities in China.

    亚运会工程已显出长远效益
    本报北京12月13日讯　北京亚运会工程尚在建设，其长远效益便已见端倪。今天，亚运村服务中心负责人同时和两个大型国际会议签订了租场合同。
    北京亚运会后，亚运村的主要建筑将改为北京国际会议中心。根据今天签订的合同，第52届国际电工委员会大会和第12届国际测量联合会大会，将分别于明、后年在这个中心举行。这两个大会的与会代表均在千人以上，分别来自40多个国家和地区。
    在签字仪式上，会议主办者介绍说，选定亚运村为会址是国际组织官员实地考察后作出的，这表明第十一届亚运会工程建设，使长期以来我国缺乏符合国际标准的会议场所的状况得到改观。
