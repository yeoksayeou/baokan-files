	**乡恋**

	In my dreams, a small boat gently rocks me,
	To Tao Qian's waters and peach orchards I go.
	I am wild and weary, the fishergirl's song
	Wets the oar, and suddenly I slip into the night's smile.
	The allure of my homeland, I've fished for a thousand times,
	Eyes straining, yearning, yet unable to grasp.
	If I cannot be part of your race, your lineage,
	My only solace is to hold Jiangnan's unique depths,
	In my heart, a wave of dawn mist I seek.
	The warmth of my hometown's longing, half the river's fishing lights
	Ignite a tangle of thoughts. My single tear
	Has drifted away, becoming your beautiful story.

	**南方**

	Looking back, I am wistful. The south is hazy,
	Olive-green, bitter and heavy. The red smoke from cooking
	Rises in great patches, like blood flowing towards me.
	I swallow the autumn mist without complaint. No more memories
	Of desolation, nowhere to go. I stand beneath the sole cloud
	Of my own delusion, reading the wings of geese returning home.
	Now the southern wind merges with the north, touching the heavens.
	The red veins of the setting sun flash by, and the lark falls
	Like a blood-red leaf, no longer swaying. Though spring's emotions
	Are scattered, and the autumn wind fills my vision, my heart's beat
	Burns brightly.

    江南二题
    王恩瑜
      乡　恋睡梦中一叶轻舟载我频频摇曳至陶潜水上桃林我狂放得有些疲惫渔女的歌声打湿桨柄倏然潜入夜的笑靥故乡的诱惑我曾打捞过一千次望眼欲穿　若即不能作为你的种族你的血缘我唯一的寄托是手捧江南独有的幽深心怀一波曦岚我寻觅乡恋的温馨半江渔火点燃纷纭的思绪我仅有的一滴眼泪已飘洒成你美丽的故事
      南　方回首怅惘南方朦胧的橄榄色酸涩而凝重腥红的炊烟泛起大片大片血之走向我吞噬无怨的秋岚不再回忆凄凉四无去处我站在唯一属于自己奢望的云翳下展读大雁归巢的翅翎此时南风融入北方触摸天痕殷红的沉脉闪过的云雀跌落如血之叶不再摇曳点点春情纵然秋风满目依旧心音灼灼
