Last year, the Strasbourg Court in France condemned the French government for violating human rights. A French magazine recently lamented that for a government that has always prided itself on human rights and freedom, this was a great "shame."

Why did this court criticize the French government? The story goes like this: In October 1980, French judicial authorities detained a Cameroonian named Mvudu on charges of bank robbery. Normally, during Mvudu's detention, the judicial authorities should have quickly clarified the facts, convicting if guilty and releasing if innocent. However, the examining magistrate delayed for over a year before allowing the defendant and witnesses to confront each other. The judicial process progressed slowly. Later, the witnesses retracted their accusations, so Mvudu was released after being wrongfully detained for over three years. This was fortunate for him, but the indefinite detention and its consequences are deeply regrettable. Moreover, according to reports, Mvudu's case was delayed not because the case was difficult to investigate, but because the presiding judge, Brady, was waiting for a better job opportunity, and his enthusiasm for work plummeted, leaving the case on the back burner.

Such a practice of detaining without investigation and verification, and detaining for years, is indeed hard to believe. No wonder French public opinion laments that detention has become a major "cancer" in France.

Due to the French government's overly casual implementation of detention, the number of detainees in France is the highest in Europe. According to statistics, last year, out of every 100,000 people, 35 were detained in France, 21 in Britain, 19 in West Germany, and 11 in Sweden. As a result, French prisons are overcrowded. According to statistics from September, there were 45,229 prisoners (including detainees) in French prisons, of whom 20,417 were detainees. This means that nearly half of the prisoners have not been tried or sentenced. Among them, some have been detained for as long as 6 years and 7 months!

Due to the long detention periods, judicial authorities often lose their objectivity and impartiality when trying cases. Because not sentencing a detainee is akin to denying the judge. Therefore, the court sometimes makes decisions unfavorable to the defendant just to save face.

Some criticize judges for knowing only detention and not choosing other methods, such as bail or house arrest. The judges' response is that due to lack of funds and social support facilities, their only choice is detention. Moreover, many of the defendants have no stable address or fixed income. A judicial official in the Paris region believes that in this sense, if a defendant is an unemployed person, then "the possibility of him being detained during the waiting period for trial is 1,000 times higher than that of a company chairman. This is of course not equal, but that's the way it is, French society is unequal. The mistake is not with the judges."

    拘留——法国司法界的顽症
    去年，法国斯特拉斯堡法院曾谴责法国政府侵犯人权。法国的一家杂志在不久前的一篇文章中感叹道，对于一向标榜人权与自由的法国政府来说，这是个莫大的“耻辱”。
    这家法院为何指责法国政府呢？事情是这样的：1980年10月，法国司法当局拘留了一位名叫姆弗杜的喀麦隆人，因为他被控犯有抢劫银行罪。照理说，在姆弗杜被拘留期间，司法当局应尽快弄清事实，有罪判刑，无罪释放。可是，预审法官拖了一年多才让被告和见证人对质。司法程序进展缓慢。后来，见证人又推翻了自己的指控，这样，姆弗杜在被无辜拘留了3年多后才重获自由。这对他来说自然是不幸中的万幸。但这种无限期的拘留及带来的后果却令人感慨万千。而且据报道，姆弗杜一案所以迟迟不审理，并非案情不好调查，而是因为主管法官布拉迪在等待另谋高就，工作热情骤减，将此案束之高阁了。
    这种不经调查核实即进行拘留、且拘留期长达几年的作法实在令人难以相信。难怪法国舆论哀叹道，拘留已成为法国的一大“癌症”。
    由于法国实施拘留过于轻率，所以法国被拘留者的人数之多居于欧洲之冠。据统计，去年，在每10万人中，法国被拘留的达35人次，英国为21，联邦德国19，瑞典11。结果，法国的监狱人满为患。据9月份的统计，法国监狱（包括拘留所）的在押犯为45229人，其中被拘留的占20417人。这就是说，近半数的在押人员都未经审讯和宣判。其中，有的被拘留的时间竟长达6年7个月！
    由于拘留期长，司法当局在审理时便往往失去应有的客观与公正。因为，不对被拘留者判刑无异于对法官的否定。所以，法庭有时仅仅为了面子，也要作出不利于被告的判决。
    有人批评法官只知道拘留，而不愿选择其它办法，如取保候审或监视居住等。法官的回答是，由于缺乏经费和社会辅助设施，他们唯一的选择就是拘留。而且，被告当中不少人是无稳定住址、无固定收入来源的人。巴黎地区的一位司法官员认为，从这个意义上讲，一个被告如果是个失业者，那么，“他在等待审判期间被拘留的可能性比之一个企业董事长高1000倍。这当然不平等，但就这么回事，法国社会就是不平等的。错误不在法官身上。”
