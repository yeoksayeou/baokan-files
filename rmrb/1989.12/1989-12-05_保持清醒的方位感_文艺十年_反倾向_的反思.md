Socialist literature in its development always encounters the opposition between the correct direction and erroneous tendencies. This is not only a manifestation of the development of literature itself but also a reflection of social contradictions in literature. These two aspects are interrelated and interdependent.

The ten-year development of socialist literature in the new period started under the historical conditions of rectifying the "leftist" errors politically. However, ten years later, it faces the rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization and another rectification against this spread. This cannot but make one reflect deeply.

Ten years ago, it was necessary to eliminate the "leftist" influence in literature. It can be said that without the rectification of the "leftist" ideological influence at that time, there would not have been the development of socialist literature in the new period over the past decade. Even today, the "leftist" tendency as an erroneous tendency must still be opposed. This is not only because eliminating the "leftist" ideological influence is a long-term task but also because, under the new situation of the times, the "leftist" ideology will appear in different new forms and contents. When we now face the erroneous tendency of bourgeois liberalization, which is the opposite of the "leftist" tendency, we have no reason to blame the past anti-"leftist" movement. However, in opposing the "leftist" erroneous tendency, there are indeed experiences and lessons to be summarized.

It is undeniable that the confusion in literary thought in the past few years provided conditions for the spread of bourgeois liberalization in the literary field. One important reason for the confusion in literary thought was that the rectification of the "leftist" ideological influence often did not stop at the correct point but led to an overcorrection, resulting in the replacement of one erroneous tendency by another. For example, in the issue of the origin of literature, we opposed the distortion of Marxist reflection theory by the "leftist" ideology, including equating the subjective initiative and creative spirit of writers and artists in the creative process with idealism, simply using social phenomena to compare and verify literary works, and simplifying aesthetic experience to life experience. However, some people took the reflection theory distorted by the "leftist" ideology as Marxism to criticize, actually defaming Marxist reflection theory as mechanical materialism, thus providing a basis for advocating idealist literary origin theory. Practice has also proven that later, some people replaced reflection theory with ontology and exaggerated and developed the idealist essence of ontology. They even used some Western idealist philosophy and psychology as theoretical support, digging down from the deep layers of the creator's psychology to the point of fantasy, leading to a serious separation and even opposition between the subjective world of writers and artists and objective life. Again, in the issue of literature grasping reality, we opposed the vulgar sociology in literary aesthetics under the influence of the "leftist" ideology, opposed the opposition between the requirements for the worldview of writers and artists and the aesthetic requirements for literature to grasp reality, and opposed the opposition between rational thinking and sensory thinking in literary creation. However, the overcorrection of this issue in the past few years was gradually pushed towards another error, which is to absolutely oppose reason and sensory, regarding sensory as the expression of the innate nature of the soul of writers and artists, believing that even the most instinctive sensory expression, even if it is considered by the world to be close to bestiality, can reach an extreme in aesthetics, while regarding reason as a thing that covers social utilitarian purposes, suppresses human instincts, and destroys the innate nature of the soul. In this way, from opposing reason to advocating human nature, from beautifying instincts to advocating bestiality, the issue of literature grasping reality was led to absurd extremes. Furthermore, in the issue of literary value orientation, we opposed the narrow utilitarianism in the relationship between literature and politics under the influence of the "leftist" ideology, opposed viewing literature as a simple tool for serving certain specific political tasks, and required literature to reflect the service to the people and socialism according to its own laws and characteristics. However, some people did not stop the rectification of the issue of literary value orientation at the correct point but continued to develop in the direction of completely deviating from the socialist ideological norms and the "two for" value standards, advocating that the value of literature lies in itself, weakening the ideological content of the works, deviating from the actual needs of the people, and further despising politics and mocking principles, showing a nihilistic and critical tendency towards socialist values in the artistic value orientation. These examples all indicate that in the process of rectifying the "leftist" ideological influence, literature indeed encountered the problem of transforming one erroneous tendency into another. The lesson of starting the rectification but not achieving the final correction is worth reflecting on.

The phenomenon of anti-"leftist" leading to the right in literature is due to both the internal factors of literature itself and the influence of various social factors, making the situation quite complex. As an experience and lesson, the most important thing is to maintain a clear sense of direction in opposing erroneous tendencies. Because the correct things always have their own clear coordinates in time and space, whether it is excessive or insufficient, even a slight difference can lead from correctness to error. Literature in its past history indeed had the influence of "leftist" ideology, but it must also be seen that its guiding theoretical foundation—the Marxist literary theory of China—has been significantly developed in long-term practice. In a series of major issues such as the relationship between literature and the people, literature and the times, literature and politics, and literature and life, it has formed a scientific theoretical system from the combination of the laws of literature itself and the external social relationships of literature. This theoretical system, after being tested by long-term practice, has indeed proven to have strict coordinate significance in regulating the basic direction of socialist literature. The anti-"leftist" leading to the right in the previous stage was a deviation from this correct coordinate, and the error in the coordinate will inevitably lead people's understanding from one erroneous tendency to another. Of course, the determination of this coordinate, in addition to the axis of direction, also has the axis of time, because the correct things also exist in a certain temporal sense. This tells us that in understanding some phenomena and problems in the past literature, we must also have a historical perspective. For those who played a positive role under the historical conditions of that time, we cannot simply use today's aesthetic and value concepts to negate and generally attribute them to the "leftist" ideology. This historical nihilism can only lead our understanding of reality to error rather than approach the truth.

In maintaining a clear sense of direction in the issue of anti-tendency in literature, we must also see the complexity of the development and change of tendencies. Practice has repeatedly proven that due to the interconnection and interdependence of internal and external contradictions in literature, and due to the complex situation where the forms of expression and ideological essence of various erroneous tendencies in literature often intersect and drift, one erroneous tendency often covers another erroneous tendency. Under certain conditions, one erroneous tendency can also transform into another erroneous tendency. Sometimes, in two erroneous tendencies, there appears a phenomenon of "you in me, me in you," or "going south while the carriage goes north," or "different tunes with the same melody." This reminds us that in the issue of anti-tendency in literature, we should maintain a clear mind and have a concept of "fighting on two fronts." Currently, we must concentrate our efforts to oppose the erroneous tendency of bourgeois liberalization. This is determined by the specific historical and social conditions of today and is also determined by the law of contradiction movement where a tendency often appears as the main contradiction. We should be unwavering in this regard. However, this does not mean that in focusing on opposing one tendency, we can abandon the concept of "fighting on two fronts." On the contrary, having a correct understanding of the issue of "fighting on two fronts" will only make us more clearly and persistently carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization.

The erroneous tendency of bourgeois liberalization must be viewed as a long-term struggle. This is not only due to the summary of historical lessons but also because the issue of anti-tendency in literature, as a reflection of the contradiction movement of literature itself, is not something that can be resolved once and for all. Precisely because of this, the anti-tendency in literature should be carried out throughout the entire process of the development of socialist literature and should be combined with the long-term construction of socialist literature. Currently, drawing lessons from history, we must prevent the struggle against bourgeois liberalization in literature from becoming a mere show of force. At the same time, we must also see that the "destruction" and "construction" in the movement of literary contradictions are in a dialectical unity, which can be "construction" within "destruction" and can also be "destruction" within "construction." In opposing the erroneous tendencies in literature, we must have both a critical hand and a hand to advocate and guide. In the past historical lessons, there were issues of both insufficient criticism and insufficient advocacy and guidance. In the process of development, socialist literature wants to prevent and overcome the infiltration and interference of various erroneous tendencies, of course, it must rely on the guidance of Marxist thought and theory and the guarantee of the Party's policies, but ultimately, it still depends on its own strength. The solution to the direction of socialist literature and the consolidation of the socialist literary front are ultimately reflected in the appearance of a large number of excellent literary works. Separating or opposing the struggle against erroneous tendencies in literature from the construction of literature is not conducive to the construction of literature and is also not conducive to the struggle against erroneous tendencies in literature.

    保持清醒的方位感
    ——文艺十年“反倾向”的反思
    弋兵
    社会主义文艺在发展中总是不时地出现正确方向与错误倾向之间的对立，这既是文艺自身发展运动的表现，也是社会矛盾在文艺上的一种反映，而这二者又是相互联系相互制约的。
    社会主义文艺在新时期的十年发展历史，是从政治上对“左”的错误进行拨乱反正的时代条件下举步的，而十年后的今天，它面对的却是资产阶级自由化思想的泛滥和针对这种泛滥的另一种拨乱反正，这不能不使人深思。
    十年前，清除文艺上“左”的影响是非常必要的，可以说没有当时对“左”的思想影响的拨乱反正，就没有社会主义文艺在新时期这十年的发展；即使是今天，“左”作为一种错误倾向，仍然要反对，这不仅是由于清除过去“左”的思想影响是一件长期的事情，而且在时代发展的新形势下，“左”的思想还会以不同的新内容和新形态出现。我们现在面对着和“左”相反的资产阶级自由化这种错误倾向时，没有理由把问题归咎于过去的反“左”，但是在反对“左”的错误倾向中并不是没有经验教训可以总结。
    勿庸讳言，前几年文艺思想上的混乱为资产阶级自由化在文艺领域滋生蔓延提供了条件，而文艺思想上出现混乱的一个重要原因，就在于对“左”的思想影响所进行的拨乱反正往往没有能停留在正确的一点上，而形成了矫枉的“过正”，于是出现了一种错误倾向为另一种错误倾向所代替的现象。例如，在文艺本源问题上，我们反对“左”的思想对马克思主义的反映论的歪曲，包括把作家艺术家创作过程中主观能动作用和创造精神等同于唯心主义，简单地用社会生活现象来对照和检验文艺作品，把审美体验简单地类比生活体验等，但有的人却把这种被“左”的思想歪曲了的反映论当作马克思主义加以批判，实际上是把马克思主义的反映论诬为机械主义，从而为宣扬唯心主义的文艺本源论作张本。实践也证明，后来有些人把本体论抬出来代替反映论，并把本体论的唯心主义实质加以发展和夸张，还把西方一些唯心主义的哲学和心理学作为理论依托，从创作主体的心理深层一直“开掘”下去，直到想入非非，导致作家艺术家主观世界与客观生活出现了严重脱离乃至对立的现象。又如，在文艺把握现实的问题上，我们反对那种在“左”的思想影响下出现的文艺审美中的庸俗社会学，反对把对作家艺术家世界观的要求同文艺把握现实的审美要求对立起来，反对把文艺创作中的理性思维与感性思维对立起来，但是，在前几年对这个问题的矫枉却被一步一步地推向了另一种谬误，这就是把理性与感性绝然对立起来，把感性视为作家艺术家心灵本性的表现，认为即使是最本能的感性表现，哪怕被世俗认为是接近兽性的东西，都可以在审美中达到一种极致，而认为理性是一种掩盖着社会功利目的、压抑人的本能、摧残人的心灵本性的东西。就这样，从反对理性到宣扬人性，由美化本能到鼓吹兽性，把文艺把握现实的问题导向了荒谬的极端。再如，在文艺价值取向问题上，我们反对在“左”的思想影响下出现的在文艺与政治关系上的狭隘功利主义，反对视文艺为简单的为某种具体政治任务服务的工具，要求文艺按照自身规律特点体现为人民服务和为社会主义服务，但有些人并没有把文艺价值取向问题上的拨乱停留在正确的一点上，而是沿着对文艺的社会主义思想规范和“二为”的价值标准全面背离的方向不断发展，宣扬文艺的价值就在于自身，淡化作品的思想内涵，脱离人民要求的实际，进而鄙夷政治、嘲弄原则，在艺术的价值取向上表现了一种对社会主义的价值观念的虚无主义和批判主义的倾向。这些例证，都说明了文艺在对“左”的思想影响进行拨乱反正的过程中确实出现了由一种错误倾向转化为另一种错误倾向的问题，这种拨乱其始却未能达到反正其终的教训，是值得反思的。
    文艺上反“左”出右这一现象的产生，既有文艺自身的原因，也有各种社会因素的影响，情况比较复杂。作为经验教训，最主要的是要求我们在反对错误倾向中要保持一种清醒的方位感。因为正确的东西总是在时间和空间上有着自己的方位明确的坐标，无论是过或是不及，哪怕是一步之差，都可能从正确走向谬误。文艺在它的过去历史中，确实存在过“左”的思想影响，但也必须看到指导它的理论基础——中国的马克思主义文艺理论在长期实践中有了非常重要的发展，在文艺与人民、文艺与时代、文艺与政治、文艺与生活的关系等一系列重大问题上，都从文艺自身规律与文艺外部社会关系的结合上形成了科学的理论体系，这个理论体系在经过了长时期实践的检验之后，已经证明其在规范社会主义文艺基本方向方面确实具有严格的坐标意义。前一阶段出现的文艺上的反“左”出右，也就是反“左”进行中对这个正确方位坐标的超越，而方位上的失误，必然把人们的认识从一种错误倾向引向另一种错误倾向。当然，这个坐标的确定，除了有方向这个轴线的标尺以外还有一个时间轴线的标尺，因为正确的东西也是在一定的时间意义上存在的。这告诉我们，认识过去文艺上的一些现象和问题，还必须有一个历史的观点。对于在当时的时代条件下起过积极作用的，不能简单地用今天的审美观念和价值观念加以否定并一概归之为“左”，这种对历史的虚无主义只能使我们对现实的认识走向谬误而不会接近真理。
    对文艺上反倾向问题要保持清醒的方位感，同时还要看到倾向发展变化中的复杂性。实践已反复证明，由于文艺内部与外部矛盾相互联系、相互制约的原因，又由于文艺上各种错误倾向的表现形式与思想实质之间常常出现交错和游离的复杂情况，所以一种错误倾向下常常掩盖着另一种错误倾向，在一定的条件下一种错误倾向也可以转化为另一种错误的倾向，有时在两种错误倾向中出现了你中有我、我中有你，或者“南辕北辙”、“异曲同工”的现象，这提醒我们在文艺反倾向问题上应该保持一个清醒的头脑，还要有一种“进行两条战线斗争”的观念。当前，我们必须集中力量反对资产阶级自由化这一错误倾向，这是今天特定的时代条件和社会条件决定的，也是倾向发展中常常出现一种倾向作为主要矛盾出现这个矛盾运动规律所决定的，对此应该坚定不移。但这不等于说在重点反对一种倾向时可以放弃“两条战线斗争”的观念，相反，在“两条战线斗争”问题上有一个正确的认识，只会使我们能够更加清醒地把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争长期坚持下去。
    对资产阶级自由化这种错误倾向必须有一个长期斗争的观念，这不只是由于对历史教训的总结，还由于文艺上的反倾向问题作为文艺自身矛盾运动的一种反映，是不可能一劳而永逸的。正由于此，文艺上的反倾向应该贯穿于社会主义文艺发展的整个过程之中，应该和社会主义文艺的长期建设结合起来。当前，汲取历史教训，要防止文艺上反对资产阶级自由化的斗争出现虎头蛇尾现象，同时也要看到，文艺矛盾运动中的“破”和“立”是一种辩证统一的关系，可以寓“立”于“破”，也可以寓“破”于“立”。反对文艺上的错误倾向时，既要有批判的一手，还要有提倡、引导的一手；在过去的历史教训中，既有批评不够的问题，也有提倡、引导不够的问题。社会主义文艺在它的发展过程中要想防止和战胜各种错误倾向的侵袭干扰，当然要靠马棵思主义的思想理论指引和党的方针政策的保证，但归根结底还是要靠它自身的壮大，社会主义文艺方向问题的解决和社会主义文艺阵地的巩固，也是最终要体现在大量的优秀的文艺产品的出现。把文艺反倾向斗争和文艺的建设割裂开来或对立起来，既不利于文艺建设，也是不利于文艺的反倾向斗争的。
