Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 14th.

Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri said that the government's current top priority is to consolidate its legitimacy and oppose any attempts to divide the country.

According to a report by the Qatar News Agency today, Hariri denied any plans to reach a solution or make a deal with Christian leader Aoun. He pointed out that this could weaken the issue of the Lebanese government's legitimacy, which is as important as the issue of Lebanese unity.

With the support of 20,000 Christian troops, Aoun refuses to recognize Hariri's government and continues to occupy the presidential palace in East Beirut.

Hariri denied any intention to include Aoun and representatives of the Christian militia in the cabinet. He said that unified action should be taken by the government to deal with the current situation threatening Lebanon's division. Hariri was appointed as Prime Minister and formed the cabinet last month by President Hrawi.

    黎总理反对国家分裂
    新华社贝鲁特12月14日电　黎巴嫩总理胡斯说，政府目前最关注的，是巩固其合法性，反对旨在分裂国家的企图。
    据卡塔尔通讯社今天报道，胡斯否认存在任何同基督教派领导人奥恩达成解决办法和交易的计划。他指出，这可能削弱黎巴嫩政府的合法性问题，这个问题和黎巴嫩统一的问题同样重要。
    有2万基督教军队支持的奥恩拒绝承认胡斯为总理的政府，继续占领贝鲁特东区的总统府。
    胡斯否认有吸收奥恩和基督教民兵代表入阁的打算。他说，应该通过政府采取统一行动来对付目前威胁黎巴嫩的分裂状态。胡斯是上月由总统赫拉维任命为总理并组阁的。
