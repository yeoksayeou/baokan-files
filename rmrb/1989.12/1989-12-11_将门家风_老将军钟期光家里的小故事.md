On November 8, the People's Liberation Army Daily published the list of winners for the "Respect the Elderly, Good Children" gold medal awards across the military. Zhong Qiguang's daughter, Zhong Dening, was on the list. The news spread through the retirement home, and someone praised, "The children of the Zhong family, though born into a military family, are not arrogant or spoiled."

The first teacher

Zhong Qiguang, who was awarded the rank of General in 1955, is 82 years old this year. During the Cultural Revolution, he was persecuted and suffered a cerebral vascular disease, leaving him with the aftereffect of hemiplegia. When talking about the education of his children, the general sitting in a wheelchair told me, "When the children were young, I was busy with work and couldn't take care of them. Their mother was mainly responsible, and they were deeply influenced by the party and the school's education."

General's wife Ling Ben is an old soldier of the New Fourth Army. She had very strict requirements for her children in terms of learning, living, and character, and she practiced what she preached at home. Zhong Dening recalled that when they were young, their parents often taught them not to seek special treatment in life. During their school days, they never had pocket money. When the school organized outings, their family only prepared steamed buns with pickled vegetables. Dening still remembers that when her fourth brother graduated from high school, the whole class went to the Summer Palace to say goodbye, and their mother only gave him three jiao, two jiao for the round-trip bus fare and one jiao for the entrance ticket. The three girls in the family wore clothes made from their brothers' old clothes when they went to middle school, some of which were patched. For a period of time, there were fewer people eating lunch at home, so their mother did not cook stir-fried dishes and just ate pickled vegetables with rice. Radish and snow peas were their two main dishes. In the evening, when everyone was back home, she would cook a few ordinary dishes. Their mother's sweater had been worn for decades and was already in tatters, but she never bought a new one and continued to wear it until she passed away a few years ago. Now, Dening and her siblings cry when they see this sweater. Zhong Dening, with tears in her eyes, said, "Mother was always generous when helping others. She bought and gave away five sweaters to her staff over the years."

Some say that parents are the first teachers of their children, and this is true. Family education is indeed an important lesson in life. It was under the influence of their parents' noble virtues of loving the party and the people, fairness, and simplicity that the Zhong Dening siblings gradually developed the good habits of thrift and diligence. In recent years, some of the brothers and sisters have been awarded for their achievements, some have invented things in their spare time and obtained patents, and some have been rated as outstanding Communist Party members and advanced workers by their units. This is directly related to the "house rules" of General and Mrs. Zhong.

"Let the children walk their own path"

Not allowing children to rely on their parents is an unwritten "house rule" in General Zhong's family. When their children faced important life decisions such as admission to school, employment, joining the party, and promotion, General and Mrs. Zhong never violated organizational principles for their children's personal gain. The general has worked in the military for a lifetime doing political and ideological work, and he has won the respect of his subordinates by adhering to principles and setting an example in obeying discipline. In recent years, some people in society have used their power to engage in improper practices and place their relatives and children in positions, and the general is particularly disgusted by this. Whenever he hears of such ugly incidents, he would angrily curse, "Shameless!" The general said, "Now it seems that these kinds of cadres are the worst. They not only corrupt social customs but also harm the relationship between the party and the people."

At that time, General Zhong's seven children, except for Zhong Dening who worked in Beijing, all went to the countryside or joined the army according to regulations. Some went to the Great Northern Wilderness to settle down. Later, the brothers and sisters who were far away gradually returned to their side, either after demobilization or after studying at university, and all took up ordinary jobs. None of them relied on the power of their elders. Zhong Dening said that her third brother in Nanjing and her fourth brother, who graduated from the Naval Engineering Academy, transferred this year, both relying on the organization or themselves to find work. Her third brother and his wife are still separated and have not been able to move to the same place.

If you talk about "connections," General Zhong has quite a few "connections" up and down, both inside and outside the military. He is an old soldier of the New Fourth Army, and in the East China region, there is no need to say more. After the founding of the nation, many old comrades-in-arms and subordinates encountered difficulties in their work and life, and all received General Zhong's enthusiastic help. He is particularly concerned about some of his old subordinates who have no jobs or power. Even for matters like treating diseases and buying medicine, he and his wife did their best to arrange them. During the Cultural Revolution, the general was isolated and struggled against, and Mrs. Ling Ben learned that some of her old comrades-in-arms, children of several provincial and municipal leaders in East China, were homeless due to their parents' persecution, she bravely took in five or six "children of black gangsters" despite her own illness, risking her life to warm these frightened and homeless children with maternal love.

However, General Zhong never does anything that violates organizational principles. The Dening siblings also strictly abide by the "house rules." Although they lack their father's "help" and "protection," making it difficult for them to be promoted or transferred, the general has no complaints. He said, "I have always advocated that children should walk their own path. As long as the children do not engage in crooked ways, that is the best."

From the 1950s to the 1980s, the environment changed, the conditions changed, and many people's ideas also changed. However, the general's "house rules" did not change. Whether the Dening siblings live independently in Beijing or reside far away, they all consciously use this to discipline themselves and their families.

    将门家风
    ——老将军钟期光家里的小故事
    本报记者　赖仁琼
    11月8日，解放军报刊出全军“敬老好儿女金榜奖”获奖名单，钟期光上将的女儿钟德宁榜上有名。消息在干休所传开，有人赞许地说：“钟家的孩子虽出身将门，但却没有骄娇二气。”第一任老师
    1955年被授予上将军衔的钟期光今年82岁。“文革”期间，因受迫害患脑血管病，留下了半身不遂后遗症。谈及子女教育，坐在轮椅上的将军告诉我：“孩子幼小时，我工作忙，顾不上，主要是他们的妈妈管，受党和学校的教育深。”
  将军夫人凌奔是新四军的老战士。她对子女在学习、生活、品质方面都有非常严格的要求，并且在家中身体力行、言传身教。钟德宁回忆说，小时候，父母常教育他们生活上不搞特殊。学生时代，他们兜里没有装过零花钱。学校组织游园活动，家里只给准备馒头夹咸菜。德宁至今还记得，四哥高中毕业时，全班去香山公园聚会告别，妈妈只给了四哥三角钱，其中两角钱买来回车票，一角钱买门票。家里三个女孩上中学时已经十五六岁，穿的衣服都是几个哥哥的旧衣改制的，有的还打了补丁。有一段时间，中午在家吃饭的人少，妈妈便不让炒菜，自己随便吃点小菜泡饭。萝卜干、雪里蕻是她家的两大主菜。到晚上大家都回家了才炒几样普通菜。妈妈的一件毛衣穿了几十年，早已破得不成样子，但她就是不买新的，一直穿到大前年去世。现在，德宁兄妹看见这件毛衣就流泪。钟德宁噙着泪花说：“妈妈帮助别人从来都是慷慨大方的。她先后买过5件毛衣送给工作人员。”
    有人说父母是孩子的第一任老师，此话不假。家庭教育确实是人生重要的一课。钟德宁兄妹正是从小在父母热爱党和人民、公正、朴实等高尚品德的影响下，慢慢养成了节俭、勤奋的好作风。这些年，兄弟姐妹有的立功受奖，有的业余时间搞发明获得了专利，还有的被单位评为优秀共产党员、先进工作者。这与将军夫妇的“家规家法”是有直接关系的。“孩子的路由孩子自己走”
    不让孩子依赖父母，是钟老将军家的一条不成文“家规”。子女在升学、就业、入党、提干等人生重要关头，将军夫妇从不违反组织原则为子女谋私。将军在部队做了一辈子思想政治工作，以坚持原则、模范遵守纪律赢得部下的普遍敬重。这几年，社会上有些人利用权势搞不正之风、安插亲信和子女等等，将军对此特别反感。每闻这类丑事，他都要气愤地大骂一句：“不要脸！”将军说：“现在看来，这种干部最坏，他们不仅败坏了社会风气，还损害了党和人民的关系。”
    当年，将军的七个子女除钟德宁在北京工作外，其余的都按规定插队下乡、参军入伍，有的到北大荒落户。后来，远在各地的兄妹或复员或考大学才陆续回到身边，都就职于普通工作岗位，无一依靠过长辈权势。钟德宁说，在南京的三哥和毕业于海军工程学院的四哥今年转业，都是依靠组织或自己联系工作。三哥三嫂至今两地分居尚未调到一起。
    要论“关系”，老将军上上下下、军内军外的“关系”还真不少。他，是新四军的老人，在华东地区就不用说了，建国后，不少老战友、老部下在工作上、生活上遇到困难，都曾得到过将军的热心帮助。他对一些无职无权的老部下尤为关切，连治病、买药等事，他和夫人都尽力操办。“文革”期间，将军被隔离、批斗，夫人凌奔得知过去的老战友、华东几位省市负责人的子女因受父母株连而无家可归时，不顾自身患病，冒着风险，毅然收留了五六个“黑帮子女”，用母爱来温暖这些东躲西藏、惊魂未定的孩子。
    然而，违反组织原则的事将军从来不做。德宁兄妹也都严格遵守“家规”，尽管他们因缺少父亲的“招呼”、“庇护”而升迁慢、调动难，但将军对此却无怨无悔。他说：“我历来主张，孩子的路由孩子自己走。只要孩子们不搞歪门邪道，就比什么都好。”
    从50年代到80年代，环境在变，条件在变，人们的许多观念也在改变。然而，将军的“家规家法”却没有变。德宁兄妹不管是在京自立门户还是远居外地，都自觉以此来约束自己和自己的家庭。
