Nearly a thousand people gathered in Nanjing today for the memorial service of the renowned calligrapher Lin Sanzhi, known as the "Grass Saint" of contemporary times. The attendees paid their respects to a master of calligraphy. Lin Sanzhi passed away on December 6 due to illness at the age of 92.

Jiangsu Provincial Governor Chen Hanyou presided over the memorial service. Deputy Governor Yang Yongyi delivered a eulogy, recalling Lin Sanzhi's humble and dedicated pursuit of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. Born in Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, Lin Sanzhi developed a deep love for calligraphy, painting, and poetry from a young age. During his prime, he studied under calligrapher Fan Peikai, former Qing Dynasty scholar Zhang Lixian, and renowned painter Huang Binhong, laying a solid foundation for his skills. To further learn from nature, he traveled extensively in the 1930s, visiting famous mountains such as Taibai, Zhongnan, and Emei. He journeyed over 18,000 miles, creating over 800 paintings and 200 poems, which significantly advanced his artistic achievements. In the four decades following the liberation, he dedicated himself to his studies, and his calligraphy reached a pinnacle of mastery.

Lin Sanzhi previously held various positions, including Vice County Magistrate of Jiangpu County, Vice Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Political Consultative Conference, Member of the National Political Consultative Conference, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Calligraphers Association, Member of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Director of the Nanjing Calligraphy and Painting Academy.

    著名书法家林散之追悼会在宁举行
    新华社南京12月21日电  （记者徐机玲）被誉为当代“草圣”的著名书法家林散之追悼会今天在南京举行，近千人哀思绵绵，痛别一代书法宗师。12月6日，林散之因病逝世，终年92岁。
    江苏省省长陈焕友主持追悼会，副省长杨泳沂在悼词中缅怀了散之老人淡泊自甘、孜孜不倦追求诗书画艺术的不平凡一生。林散之出生于江苏省江浦县，自幼酷爱书画诗文。青壮年时期，他先后从师书法家范培开、前清进士张栗庵、国画大师黄宾虹，打下了扎实的基本功。为了进一步师法自然，他又在三十年代不辞千辛万苦，孤身一人游历太白、终南、峨眉等名山大川，实地写生、跋涉一万八千余里，得画稿八百多幅、诗两百多首，使其艺术成就产生了一次飞跃。解放以后的四十年间，他勤奋治学，书法艺术逐渐达到炉火纯青的高超境界。
    林散之生前曾先后担任江浦县副县长、南京市政协副主席、全国政协委员、中国书法家协会常务理事、全国文联委员、南京书画院院长等职。
