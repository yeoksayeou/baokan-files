Title: Fruit and Grain Compete for Land, Both Suffer

Recently, in our area, farmers have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for planting fruit trees. They vividly refer to fruit trees as "money trees," saying things like, "Plant money trees in the fields, and you won't have to worry about rice and flour." Some farmers, eager for quick results, have started planting fruit trees in their farmland. In some places, to make fruit tree planting "large-scale," there have been widespread calls for farmers to plant fruit trees extensively in their farmland. The result is that fertile "grain-producing land" has turned into "non-grain-producing land."

Fruit trees generally take three to five years to bear fruit. During these years, farmers do not see any benefits and thus cannot afford to buy rice and flour, making the grain shortage problem unavoidable. Additionally, sometimes the price of fruit drops, and farmers have no choice but to plant crops in the fields where they have already planted fruit trees. The small fruit trees can only hide awkwardly among the crops, turning the "money trees" into "unlucky trees." Farmers say, "Fruit trees don't bear fruit, wasting two units of grain."

Therefore, I believe that when planning grain and fruit production, each locality must tailor its approach to local conditions and consider the overall situation. This way, both fruit and grain can find their proper place, and both can develop harmoniously.

    果粮争地两败俱伤
    河北省兴隆县　李智慧
    最近几年，我们这一带农民栽植果树的热情空前高涨，大家形象地把果树称为“摇钱树”，还说什么“地里栽上摇钱树，吃米吃面不用愁”。有些农民为了早结果，快见效，开始将果树往农田里栽植；一些地方为了使果树“成规模”，广泛号召农民往农田里大面积栽植果树，结果是肥沃的“拿粮地”变成了“无粮地”。
    果树一般需经三五年的时间才能结果。在这几年当中，农民得不到利，也就拿不出钱去买大米白面，缺粮问题难免突出地表现出来；再加上有时果品价格回落，农民又不得不在已栽上果树的农田里种庄稼。小果树只能委曲地在庄稼地里藏“猫猫”，摇钱树变成了“受气树”，农民又说：“果树不结果，白搭二斗粮”。
    因此，我认为各地在部署粮果规划时，一定要因地制宜，统筹兼顾，使果粮各得其所，协调发展。
