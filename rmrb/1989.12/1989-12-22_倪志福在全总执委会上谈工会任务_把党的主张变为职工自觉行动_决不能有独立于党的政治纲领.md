Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st.

Nie Rongzhu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, stated today at the 11th Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions that "Trade unions must not have a political program independent of the Party, and must not allow political proposals that oppose the Party. All levels of trade union cadres, especially leading cadres, must strive to propagate and implement the Party's policies and guidelines, and through their work and the democratic procedures of the trade unions, turn the Party's proposals into resolutions of the trade unions and the conscious actions of the broad masses of workers."

Nie Rongzhu said that the lessons from the turmoil this past spring and summer are invaluable. As a mass organization of the working class and an important pillar of the state power, the trade unions must consistently uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and oppose the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution" by international reactionary forces. In major political struggles and sudden events, the trade unions must, under the leadership of the Party, actively and proactively do good work among the masses.

Nie Rongzhu said that relying wholeheartedly on the working class is a fundamental guiding ideology that our Party and state have always adhered to. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the Party Central Committee has reiterated this fundamental guiding ideology, which has important practical significance. In socialist state-owned enterprises, management personnel, engineering and technical personnel, and workers are all members of the working class. Different labor divisions do not make them separate from the workers, and there should not be an independent "management class." We must continue to support the implementation of the manager responsibility system and maintain the central position and management authority of managers in enterprises. Managers must establish the idea of relying on the masses of workers to run the enterprise well and respect the democratic rights of workers. Currently, the phenomenon of excessive and non-transparent disparities in distribution in some enterprises has seriously affected the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers.

Nie Rongzhu said that the stability of the state is the top political task. The rectification and economic adjustment will inevitably cause some temporary difficulties for the lives of workers. The more so at such a time, the more the trade unions at all levels must actively and proactively do their work, educate workers to understand the current situation, and actively and proactively find solutions to get through the difficulties. In the process of rationalizing labor organization, surplus personnel should, in principle, be arranged by the enterprise itself and not pushed onto society, so as to reduce the pressure of social employment. The reform of the social insurance system should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. Unauthorized units should not arbitrarily change the state's regulations on workers' insurance benefits. In the face of many difficulties and complex contradictions, more "snow in winter" work should be done to make the broad masses of workers feel "warm in hard times," and not do "adding fuel to the fire" work. Strengthen foresight and initiative, strive to resolve contradictions at the grassroots level, and resolve them in the bud. Trade unions should go to the masses, propagate the Party's policies and guidelines, support the reasonable demands of workers, and do their utmost to help workers solve actual difficulties that can be solved; they should be good at persuading workers to give up some overly high and urgent demands, understand the difficulties of the state and enterprises, and work together with the Party and government, with one heart and one mind, to pull the economy up.

    倪志福在全总执委会上谈工会任务
    把党的主张变为职工自觉行动
    决不能有独立于党的政治纲领
    本报北京12月21日讯　记者张国荣报道：“工会决不能有独立于党的政治纲领，决不允许提出同党对立的政治主张。各级工会干部特别是领导干部，要努力宣传贯彻党的方针政策，善于通过自己的工作和工会的民主程序，把党的主张变为工会的决议和广大职工的自觉行动。”这是中华全国总工会主席倪志福今天在全总11届2次执委会上说的一番话。
    倪志福说，今年春夏之交那场风波留给了我们宝贵的经验。工会作为工人阶级的群众组织，作为国家政权的重要支柱，必须始终如一地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，反对国际反动势力“和平演变”的阴谋。在重大政治斗争和突发事件面前，工会必须在党的领导下，积极主动地做好群众工作。
    倪志福说，全心全意依靠工人阶级是我们党和国家一贯的根本指导思想。党的十三届四中全会以来，党中央又重申这一根本指导思想，有着十分重要的现实针对性。在社会主义的公有制企业中，经营管理人员、工程技术人员和工人都是工人阶级的成员，劳动分工不同，都是企业主人，不应当把社会主义企业的经营管理者从职工中分离出去，形成什么独立的“经营者阶层”。我们要继续支持实行厂长（经理）负责制，维护厂长（经理）在企业的中心地位和管理权威。厂长（经理）要树立依靠职工群众办好企业的思想，尊重职工的民主权利。当前一部分企业的经营者和职工在分配上过分悬殊和不公开的现象，已严重影响了广大职工的积极性。
    倪志福说，国家的稳定是压倒一切的政治任务。治理整顿和经济调整，不可避免地会给职工生活造成某些暂时困难。越是在这样的时候，各级工会越要积极主动做好工作，教育职工理解当前形势，积极主动寻找渡过难关的解决办法。在劳动组织的合理化过程中产生的富余人员，原则上由企业自行安置，不要推向社会，以减轻社会就业压力。社会保险改革要有领导、有步骤地进行试点，非经授权单位批准，各地方和企业不应随意改变国家规定的职工保险待遇。在困难众多、矛盾纷杂的情况下，要多做“雪里送炭”的事情，使广大职工感到“紧中有暖”，不要做“雪上加霜”的事情，防止“火上加油”。要加强预见性和主动性，力争把矛盾解决在基层，解决在萌芽状态。工会要到群众中去，宣传党的方针政策，要支持职工的合理要求，尽最大可能帮助职工解决可能解决的实际困难；要善于说服职工放弃某些过高过急的要求，体谅国家和企业的困难，与党和政府一起，同心协力，和衷共济，把经济搞上去。
