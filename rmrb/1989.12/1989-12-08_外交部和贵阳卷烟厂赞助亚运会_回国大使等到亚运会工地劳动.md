Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7th.

Today, staff from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chinese embassies and consulates abroad donated 100,000 yuan to the Asian Games. Leaders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Qi Huaiyuan and Wang Yanzhang, led staff members and returning ambassadors to the Asian Games construction site to participate in voluntary labor and handed over the donation to the Asian Games Organizing Committee. Guiyang Cigarette Factory donated a large sum to the Asian Games, totaling 10 million yuan, making it the largest single donor from the southwestern region to date.

Guiyang Cigarette Factory also specially developed and produced the 90-brand cigarettes for the Asian Games, becoming the designated product for the 11th Asian Games. Today, Zhang Baifu, the executive vice-chairman of the Asian Games, highly praised the two units for their concern and support for the Asian Games. Zhang Baifu said: Those embassy colleagues who have been stationed abroad for a long time are still very concerned about the preparations for the Asian Games, far away from their motherland. We must work with even higher enthusiasm to successfully host the Asian Games.

Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Huaiyuan said: 100,000 yuan is not much, but it represents the heartfelt support of our diplomatic personnel.
