Yield-Enhancing Bacteria Promoted Over 100 Million Mu

Already Used on Over 50 Types of Crops

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th — Correspondent Chen Man Zheng reports: Professor Chen Yanhui of Beijing Agricultural University has invented a yield-enhancing bacteria that has been promoted over an area of 1.15 billion mu in the past three years. The bacteria have strong adaptability, disease resistance, and cold resistance, and have been used on more than 50 types of crops. This year, the new output value for grain, cotton, and oil alone has reached 28.5 million yuan, with an economic benefit ratio of over 1:30.

The yield-enhancing bacteria was developed by Professor Chen in 1979 based on the principles of plant ecological engineering. Currently, there are three types of production: solid bacteria, powder, and liquid bacteria. They can be sprayed, scattered, or mixed with seeds, and can also be soaked in seeds or roots. They are convenient to use, safe for humans and animals, and do not pollute the environment or soil.

Farmers spend the cost of one egg per mu when using the yield-enhancing bacteria, but in return, they get a 10-30% increase in crop yield.

    增产菌推广上亿亩
    已有五十多种农作物使用
    本报北京12月27日讯　记者陈满正报道：北京农业大学陈延熙教授发明的增产菌，三年来在全国推广面积达1.15亿亩。增产菌适应性强，抗病抗寒，已在50多种农作物上使用；今年仅粮棉油三项就新增产值28.5万元，经济效益比为1∶30以上。
    增产菌是陈教授1979年依据植物生态工程学原理研制成功的一种新型菌肥。目前生产的有固体菌型、粉剂型、液体菌型三种，使用时可喷、可撒、可拌种，也可浸种、泡根，既方便，又对人畜安全，不污染环境和土壤。
    农民使用增产菌一亩地花一个鸡蛋的钱，换来的却是农作物增产10—30％。
