Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, December 29th.

The Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim, issued a New Year message today stating that 1990 will be a milestone year for Africa in its pursuit of economic liberation and integrated development.

The message particularly draws attention to the severe economic difficulties Africa will face next year, which will hinder the continent's efforts to recover and develop economically.

The message points out: "We are entering 1990 facing a worrying economic reality. The terms of trade for African countries continue to deteriorate. As we have seen, the prices of Africa's main imported goods are continually rising, while the prices of exported goods are sharply falling, creating a huge gap between import expenditures and export revenues." The message adds that it is disappointing that the international community has not fulfilled its promises to increase the flow of funds into the African continent.

Regarding Africa's $230 billion external debt, the message states that in the new year, Africa should redouble its efforts to win the understanding and support of the international community in addressing this issue.

The message notes that due to the continued unfavorable international economic environment for Africa and other developing regions, despite Africa's significant efforts over the past year, it has not achieved sufficient results.

The message states that Africa achieved significant political achievements in 1989, the most notable being the process of Namibian independence.

Regarding the situation in South Africa, the message states that the release of some political prisoners and the opening of some public venues cannot be seen as "substantial structural changes" in South Africa.

The message calls on African countries to redouble their efforts next year to support all measures aimed at peacefully resolving conflicts between African nations.

    非统组织秘书长发表新年文告指出
    明年非洲将争取经济解放
    新华社亚的斯亚贝巴12月29日电　非洲统一组织秘书长萨利姆今天发表新年文告指出，1990年将是非洲争取经济解放和一体化发展的里程碑。
    文告特别要人们注意明年非洲经济的严重困难，它将阻碍非洲为经济恢复和发展所作的努力。
    文告指出：“我们面对令人担忧的经济现实进入了1990年。非洲国家的贸易条件继续恶化。正像我们所见到的那样，非洲主要进口商品价格不断上涨，出口物资价格骤然下跌，使进口开支和出口收入之间存在巨大差距。”文告说，令人失望的是，国际社会没有履行使资金流入非洲大陆的承诺。
    文告在谈到非洲2300亿美元外债问题时说，在新的一年里，非洲应加倍努力，以赢得国际社会对解决这个问题的理解和支持。
    文告指出，由于仍存在着对非洲和其他发展中地区不利的国际经济环境，虽然一年来非洲作出了重大努力，但未能得到足够的成果。
    文告说，非洲在1989年取得了重大的政治成果，最明显的是纳米比亚独立进程。
    关于南非形势，文告说，释放一些政治犯和开放一些公共场所决不能看成是南非进行了“实质性的结构变革”。
    文告呼吁非洲国家来年加紧努力，支持和平解决非洲国家之间冲突的一切措施。
