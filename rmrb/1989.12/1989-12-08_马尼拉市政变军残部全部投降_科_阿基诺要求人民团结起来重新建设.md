The remaining 300 mutineers who had occupied the commercial district of Makati in the Philippine capital of Manila surrendered to the government today.

General Arturo Enrile, who represented the government in negotiations with the mutineers, told reporters that the mutineers surrendered unconditionally and agreed to return to their barracks and take responsibility for the consequences of this mutiny.

Enrile, who is currently the president of the Philippine Military Academy, said that the mutineers have begun to withdraw from the high-rise buildings in the Makati commercial district. The mutineers, after suffering setbacks in several military bases on the 3rd, entered the district and were at a stalemate with the government troops. Enrile predicted that the mutineers would likely complete their withdrawal by this afternoon.

Enrile revealed that after the 300 mutineers withdraw, they will be immediately transferred to the headquarters of the Philippine Army in Bonifacio.

Enrile said that the government agrees to treat the mutineers in a "humane, fair, and just" manner. However, he added that they will be punished for launching this mutiny. As for how they will be punished, he said that this is a matter for the political leadership to decide.

Additionally, about 500 mutineers are still occupying the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, the second-largest city in southern Manila. It is believed that they will soon surrender to the government.

In a statement issued in Manila today, Philippine President Corazon Aquino said that the week-long mutiny has ended and called on the nation to unite and rebuild.

The statement said, "I am particularly relieved that the siege of the Makati Financial Center was ended with the minimum of casualties. I thank the people and the military for their trust in me and express my appreciation to those who helped end the urban terrorism. Now, we must join hands, unite as one, and rebuild what has been destroyed."

    马尼拉市政变军残部全部投降
    科·阿基诺要求人民团结起来重新建设
    新华社马尼拉12月7日电  占据菲律宾首都马尼拉商业区马卡蒂的约300名政变军今天向政府投降。
    代表政府军与政变军谈判的阿图罗·恩里莱准将对记者说，政变军是无条件投降的，他们同意退回营地并对此次政变后果负责。
    现为菲军事学院院长的恩里莱说，政变军已开始从马卡蒂商业区的数幢高楼撤离。政变军3日在几个军事基地受挫于政府军后攻入该区，与政府军对峙。恩里莱预计政变军可能在下午前撤完。
    恩里莱透露，这300名政变军撤出后将被立即转往菲陆军总部所在地博尼法西奥。
    恩里莱说，政府同意对政变军采取“人道、公正和公平”的对待态度。但他又说他们将因发动此次政变而受到惩罚。至于怎么惩罚他们，他说，这是政治领导人决定的问题。
    另外，约500名政变军仍占着马尼拉南部第二大城市宿务的麦克坦空军基地。据认为，他们很快会向政府投降。
    新华社马尼拉12月7日电  菲律宾总统科拉松·阿基诺今天在马尼拉市马卡蒂金融中心区的叛军投降后发表声明说，持续一周的政变已经结束，全国人民团结起来，重新建设。
    声明说，我对以最小的代价结束对马卡蒂金融中心区的围困特别感到宽慰。我感谢人民和军队对我的信任并对那些帮助结束城市恐怖主义的人们表示赞赏。现在，我们必须携起手来，万众一心，重建被毁坏的一切。
