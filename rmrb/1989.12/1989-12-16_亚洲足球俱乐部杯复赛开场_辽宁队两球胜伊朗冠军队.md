According to a report from the *Sports Daily*, the ninth Asian Club Football Cup semi-finals began on December 13th in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Chinese Liaoning team, placed in Group B, won their first match against the Iranian national champions, Sasan, with a score of 2-0.

The return of several Liaoning players to the national team has significantly boosted the strength of Liaoning's three lines of defense. The forward line, featuring a combination of veterans like Ma Lin and Huang Chong, along with newcomers like Xu Hui, is highly effective. The midfield, consisting of Tang Yao Dong, Gao Sheng, and Sun Wei, is particularly adept. The defensive line, anchored by the tall central defenders Zhao Faqing and Dong Liqiang, along with veteran Li Yi and Li Zhen on the left and right wings, and goalkeeper Fu Yubin, who gained fame in the World Cup qualifying match against Saudi Arabia, is very solid. In the first 85 minutes of the game, facing the tall and physically strong Iranian team, which included four national team players, Liaoning played tenaciously and maintained a significant advantage. In the final five minutes, first, right-back Li Zhen assisted from the right flank with a cross, and veteran Ma Lin headed the ball into the net. Then, left-back Li Yi passed the ball forward to an open space, and Xu Hui sprinted in to score again.

In the other Group B match, the Indonesian team drew 1-1 with the Iraqi team. On December 15th and 17th, Liaoning will face the Indonesian team and the Iraqi team, respectively. The semi-finals will conclude on December 23rd. The teams that finish first in Groups A and B will compete for the championship.

    亚洲足球俱乐部杯复赛开场
    辽宁队两球胜伊朗冠军队
    本报讯　据《体育报》报道：第九届亚洲足球俱乐部杯复赛12月13日在印度尼西亚首都雅加达开战。分在B组的中国辽宁队在首场比赛中以2∶0击败伊朗全国冠军沙辛队。
    数名辽宁籍国腿归队使辽宁队三条线实力大增。马林、黄崇、徐晖新老结合的前锋线很有冲击力；由唐尧东、高升、孙伟组成的中场更显得得心应手；赵发庆、董礼强两名高大中卫和老将李毅、李铮左右两个边后卫，加上在世界杯外围赛中沙之战出尽风头的门将傅玉斌，使后防线颇为牢固。在前85分钟的比赛里，面对身材高大、拥有4名国脚的伊朗队，辽宁队打得十分顽强，占有较大优势。在最后5分钟里，先是右后卫李铮右路助攻传中，老将马林头球攻中；后是左后卫李毅直传前场空当，徐晖单骑插上，再度得手。
    在B组的另一场比赛中，印尼队与伊拉克队1∶1战平。本月15日和17日，辽宁队将分别迎战印尼队和伊拉克队。全部复赛于23日结束。获A组和B组第一名的队将争夺冠军。
