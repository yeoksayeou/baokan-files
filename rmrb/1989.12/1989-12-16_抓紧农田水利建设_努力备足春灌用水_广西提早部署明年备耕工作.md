At the end of last month, the various levels of leadership in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region began early preparations for next year's spring plowing work, adding measures to lay the foundation for a bumper grain harvest.

To ensure adequate water for next spring's irrigation, Wei Chunshu, Chairman of the Autonomous Region, has urged all levels of party and government leaders and water conservancy departments to focus on agricultural water conservancy construction from four aspects: First, carry out comprehensive maintenance and upgrades on existing agricultural water conservancy facilities, especially for large and medium-sized reservoirs that still have water and irrigation projects that can still draw water. All facilities within the irrigation areas should be thoroughly inspected, channels should be cleared, leaks should be repaired, and efforts should be made to quickly restore and improve irrigation benefits. Second, repair, update, and transform existing mechanical and electrical pump equipment to ensure their effectiveness. Third, vigorously develop groundwater resources. Wherever there are water sources and along the banks of rivers, new mechanical and electrical pumping stations should be built and new wells should be drilled. Fourth, carry out maintenance and preparation work for artificial rainmaking cannons and ammunition.

Currently, winter agricultural water conservancy construction is underway from north to south throughout the entire Autonomous Region. As of November 30, the number of workers at work across the entire Autonomous Region has reached 2.4 million, with 20.66 million workdays completed. A total of 303 kilometers of leaking canals have been repaired, 15,394 kilometers of canals have been dredged, 12,200 mu of new irrigation area has been added, and 178,000 mu of irrigation area has been restored and improved.

    抓紧农田水利建设　努力备足春灌用水
    广西提早部署明年备耕工作
    据新华社南宁12月15日电　（记者赖玉章、通讯员吴秀光）广西壮族自治区各级领导机关提早部署明年备耕工作，增添措施，为夺取粮食丰收打下基础。
    为了备足明年春灌用水，自治区主席韦纯束要求各级党政领导和水利部门，从四个方面搞好农田水利建设：一、搞好现有农田水利维修配套，特别是对现在仍蓄有水的大中型水库和有水可引的引水工程，灌区内的工程设施，要全面检修，清理渠道，防渗堵漏，尽快恢复和提高灌溉效益；二、对现有的机电泵设备进行维修，更新改造，确保发挥效益；三、大力开发地下水，凡有水源的地方以及江河两岸，要兴建一批新的机电提水站，新打一批水井；四、做好人工降雨高炮的检修保养和炮弹准备工作。
    目前全自治区的冬季农田水利建设正从北至南展开。截至11月30日，全自治区上工人数已达240万人，投工日2066万个，整修渗漏渠道303公里，渠道清淤15394公里，新增灌溉面积1.22万亩，恢复和改善灌溉面积17.8万亩。
