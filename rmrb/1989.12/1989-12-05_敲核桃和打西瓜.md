    The topic here is military strategy, not culinary practices, but I want to connect them to explore some economic issues.

    In April 1947, under the pressure of a formidable enemy, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China withdrew from Yan'an and stationed in Qingyangzha, Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province. The situation was extremely dire. Facing a disparity of 10 to 1 in enemy strength, how could we turn the tables? How should this battle be fought? We had no confidence and could not help but feel anxious and uncertain, with much discussion and debate. It was at this time—on April 6, 1947—that Commander-in-Chief Ren Bishi and Political Commissar Lu Dingyi of the Central Column addressed the entire Central Committee staff in a political mobilization at the command headquarters. I was also among the audience. Ren Bishi's speech is detailed in the article "Ren Bishi's Demeanor During the Campaign in Shaanxi-North" published in the People's Daily on July 20, 1986. This article stirred my memories of that time.

    The enemy forces of Hu Zongnan, ten times our size with 230,000 troops, occupied Yan'an and were arrogant and overbearing. At that time, our forces exposed a small part of our troops to the enemy, feigning a retreat to the northwest. But just as the fake Central News Agency broadcasted, "The Communist forces are retreating towards Anse, and the National Army is pursuing and annihilating them," our main forces of the Northwest Field Army were actually lying in ambush in Qinghuacheng to the northeast of Yan'an, swiftly annihilating Hu Zongnan's 132nd Brigade. Our army was beloved by the people of Shaanxi-North, and the relationship between the military and the people was as close as fish and water. Therefore, our army's movements were unknown to the enemy, while we were fully aware of the enemy's movements. It was in this environment that Lu Dingyi gave his speech. He said:

    "With more than 200,000 enemy troops concentrated in the Yan'an area, we cannot annihilate them. However, as long as they extend their lines and continue to advance north, they will have to divide their forces along the long front line to set up defensive points. As long as their main forces advance for three days without being able to return to rescue, we can concentrate our superior forces to annihilate their small, unstable enemy forces. This is called the 'cracking walnuts' tactic—eat one at a time, eat and leave, then seize the next opportunity. Doing this for several rounds will fatigue the enemy forces and wear down their morale. While our forces hide locally, rest, and wait for the enemy to tire, we can seize the opportunity to annihilate large enemy forces in motion, accumulating small victories into big victories. This is called the 'smashing watermelons' tactic. It is the process of transforming the quantitative disparity between enemy and us into a qualitative change."

    Soon after, the victorious battle of Panlong took place, and in May, a grand victory celebration was held in Zhenwudong, Anse County, announcing that the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao would stay in Shaanxi-North and fight alongside the military and people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The morale and spirit of the entire border region were greatly boosted.

    In August, the famous battle of Miaoji Sandiaozhuang turned the tide, and our forces advanced like a raging fire. The watermelons got bigger and bigger, and the Hu Zongnan forces besieged in Yan'an had no choice but to abandon the city and flee south on April 21, 1948. Yan'an finally returned to the hands of the people.

    The situation on the national battlefield was roughly the same: we did not know how many big and small walnuts we had cracked, gradually developing into smashing many big and small watermelons, and finally smashing the three largest watermelons in Liaoning, Tianjin, and Huaihai.

    War and construction are two different things and cannot be rigidly compared; but there are many philosophical and scientific principles that are similar.

    The Japanese have long studied the ancient Chinese military strategy of Sunzi to guide their economic construction. In recent years, China's economic theory circles, in their exploration of a socialist path with Chinese characteristics, have also been researching and writing books on how to apply Sunzi's military strategy to economic management. The rich military thoughts of Mao Zedong in China, both inheriting the ancient Chinese military dialectics and developing the modern war dialectics. In my opinion, reviewing the strategy and tactics from cracking walnuts to smashing watermelons on the Shaanxi-North battlefield can provide beneficial enlightenment for today's modernization construction. Currently, facing the tasks of rectification and reform, facing the actual difficulties of funds, materials, and talents, and facing the urgent need for key construction, we should strive to achieve the grand goal of modernization while creating a sustainable, stable, and coordinated economic environment.

    敲核桃和打西瓜
    田方
    我这里讲的是兵法，不是讲吃法，又想联系起来探讨一些经济问题。
    1947年4月，那是在强敌压境之下，党中央撤离延安，驻守在陕北靖边县青阳岔的时候，处境十分严峻。面对敌我10与1之比的强弱悬殊的局面，如何扭转？这个仗究竟怎么打法？我们心里是没有底的，不能不焦灼不安，议论纷纷。正在这时——1947年4月6日，中央纵队司令员任弼时同志和政委陆定一同志，就在司令部驻地的一块场地上，对中央机关全体人员作了一次政治动员。当时，我也是在场听众之一。任弼时同志的讲话，已详载于1986年7月20日人民日报的《任弼时同志在转战陕北中的风范》一文，这篇文章，勾起了我对当时情景的回忆。
    十倍于我的敌人胡宗南部队23万人，侵占延安以后，骄横跋扈，不可一世。当时，我军以一小部分队伍暴露敌前，佯装往西北方向撤退。但正当伪中央社广播宣称：“共军往安塞方向溃退，国军正追击聚歼中”的时候，我西北野战军主力部队恰在延安东北方向青化砭设伏，一举歼灭了胡宗南132旅。我军受陕北人民拥戴，军民关系如鱼水，所以我军行动敌人一无所知；而敌军行动，我却了如指掌。陆定一同志就是在这个环境下讲话的，他说：
    20多万敌人在延安地区缩成一团，我们是无法消灭它的。但是，只要它拉长战线，继续北侵，就必须在漫长的战线上沿途分兵设点驻防；只要它主力前侵三天之内无法回兵救援，我们就可以集中优势兵力，消灭它点上立足未稳的小股敌军。这就叫做敲核桃战术，一口吃掉，吃了就走，再捕捉下次战机。这么来回几个回合，疲劳敌军，消磨敌军士气；而我军则就地隐蔽，以逸待劳，就可以抓住战机，争取在运动中歼灭大股敌军，积小胜为大胜，这就叫做打西瓜战术。也就是敌我力量对比，由量变到质变的过程。
    不久又经过胜利的蟠龙战斗，5月间在安塞县真武洞召开万人祝捷大会，宣布党中央、毛主席留驻陕北和陕甘宁边区军民共同奋战，全边区士气民心为之大振。
    八月间，著名的米脂沙家店战役胜利转折，我军势如破竹，西瓜越打越大，困守延安的胡宗南部队，不得不于1948年4月21日弃城南逃。延安，终于回到了人民手中。
    全国战场的形势，大体也是不知道打了多少大大小小的核桃，以至逐步发展到打了多少大大小小的西瓜，最后才打了辽沈、平津、淮海三个最大的西瓜。
    战争和建设是两码事，不可硬性类比；但其中有不少哲理与科学规律也有相通之处。
    日本人早就学习我国古代的孙子兵法，以指导其经济建设。近年来，我国的经济理论界为探索具有中国特色的社会主义道路，也在研究、著书立说，怎样把孙子兵法运用于经济管理。中国丰富的毛泽东军事思想中，既继承了中国古代的军事辩证法，又发展了现代战争的辩证法。愚意以为，重温陕北战场从敲核桃到打西瓜的战略战术，对于今天的四化建设，我想不无有益的启示。当前，面对治理和改革的任务，面对资金、物资与人才等实际困难，面对重点建设的迫切需要，我们应当努力做到既要实现四化宏伟目标，又要创造一个持续、稳定、协调发展的经济环境。
