Since the beginning of winter, the Inner Mongolia Zhelimu League has mobilized over 7,800 cadres from the league, banner (county, city), and township (town, sumu) levels. These cadres have formed 3,000 work teams and, starting from early December, have been deeply involved in the rural and pastoral areas of the entire league to carry out socialist education. They have been delivering policies, technology, and culture to the farmers and herdsmen. The political situation in the rural and pastoral areas of the entire league is stable, people's minds are at ease, and production and social order have shown a pleasing situation unprecedented in recent years.

The Zhelimu League is located in the heart of the Khorchin Grassland in the northern border of China and is an area with a combined agricultural and pastoral economy. In recent years, the league has always focused on agriculture as the foundation of the entire league's industry, and grain production has been steadily increasing year by year. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, some farmers and herdsmen had fears of chaos and policy changes. To stabilize agriculture and stabilize people's minds, the league committee decided to take advantage of the winter downtime to organize cadres to go to the grassroots level and carry out propaganda and education work.

They focused on solving three problems: first, educating farmers and herdsmen, especially party members and cadres, on the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee; second, conducting democratic evaluations of party members in rural and pastoral grassroots party branches to enhance the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the leadership; and third, revising the development plan to achieve the second economic doubling by 1992 and arranging production for 1990.

The league committee treated this socialist education as the central task for the rural and pastoral areas of the entire league and strengthened leadership accordingly. The league committee established a socialist education office. The work team members brought their own luggage, ate, lived, and studied with the farmers and herdsmen, and participated in labor during their spare time, thereby strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses through their actions.

The socialist education has promoted the construction of two civilizations in rural and pastoral areas. The production situation is stable, social customs have significantly improved, the public security situation has greatly improved, the crime rate at the grassroots level has decreased compared to the same period last year, and scientific and cultural activities have been unprecedentedly active.

    哲里木盟七千干部下基层
    本报讯　入冬以来，内蒙古哲里木盟抽调盟、旗（县市）、乡（镇、苏木）三级7800多名干部，组成了3000个工作队，从12月初开始深入全盟农村牧区开展社会主义教育，为农牧民送政策、送科技、送文化。全盟农村牧区政治稳定，人心安定，生产和社会秩序出现了近年来未有的喜人形势。
    哲里木盟地处我国北部边疆的科尔沁草原腹地，属农牧结合的经济类型区。近年来，哲盟一直把农业做为全盟的基础产业来抓，粮食产量连年稳定增长。平息北京反革命暴乱之后，部分农牧民中产生了怕乱怕政策变的思想，为了稳定农业，稳定民心，及时把党的十三届五中全会精神和党中央关于全党大办农业的号召，送到农家牧户，送到全盟的每个角落，哲盟盟委决定利用冬闲的有利时机，组织干部下基层，做宣传教育工作。
    他们重点解决三个问题：一是对农牧民特别是党员干部进行党的十三届四中全会、五中全会精神的教育；二是搞好农村牧区基层党支部的民主评议党员工作，提高班子的凝聚力、战斗力；三是修订到1992年实现第二个经济翻番的发展规划，安排好1990年生产。
    哲盟盟委把这次社会主义教育作为当前全盟农村牧区的中心工作，切实加强领导。盟委成立了社教办公室。工作队员自带行李，与农牧民同吃、同住、同学习，挤时间参加劳动，用自己的实际行动密切了干群关系。
    社会主义教育促进了农村牧区两个文明建设。生产形势稳定，社会风气明显改善，治安状况大有好转，基层犯罪率比往年同期下降，科技文化活动空前活跃。
