The coal mine in Tangjiazhuang's Third District has maintained a "record of merits" for its workers for 13 years, cultivating a team dedicated to the mine and pioneering hard work. They have also nurtured nationally renowned labor models. They refer to this "record of merits" as the "dumb" effort of ideological and political work. In fact, this "dumb" method is not dumb at all.

During the reform and opening-up, a large number of entrepreneurial managers have emerged, but there are also countless ordinary workers who silently contribute on the front lines of production, especially coal miners who work underground for years in what is described as "two stones squeezing a piece of meat." What they need most is spiritual understanding, recognition, and respect.

The coal mining Third District of Tangjiazhuang records the merits of its workers, affirming and respecting their contributions and progress. It is precisely this respect that unleashes the hidden potential within people. It motivates the laggards to strive forward and the advanced to strive even harder.

In the past, it was often said that spirit is seen in the smallest details. Ideological and political work should start from the smallest details. Because not everyone can do big things every day or achieve great feats. Many of the heroes of our time have grown from their daily work, such as working overtime for a few hours, completing more work, achieving small technological innovations, helping others, and so on. Some people persist in these efforts for many years. These things happen around the workers, and everyone knows about them. Affirmation and praise for these things make the workers feel cared for.

The "record of merits" of Tangjiazhuang coal mine sees the big in the small and recognizes people through small deeds. The "record of merits" is used to select advanced workers and labor models, and the workers feel equal and convinced. The selected labor models thus have more influence.

Ideological and political work cannot be done in a hasty manner. The "record of merits" of Tangjiazhuang coal mine is a "dumb" effort that accumulates over time. It is precisely this effort, close to the workers, that plays a role in ideological and political work, making it specific and vivid.

The "record of merits" does not bury the merits of the workers; it is indeed a good method!

    “笨”法不笨
    墨村
    唐家庄煤矿三区坚持13年为职工记“功劳簿”，锤炼出了一支扎根矿山、艰苦创业的队伍，培养了全国有名的劳动模范。他们称记“功劳簿”是思想政治工作的“笨功夫”。其实，这种“笨”法不笨。
    改革开放中，涌现出一大批勇于开拓进取的企业经营者，但更有众多的普通工人在艰苦的生产第一线默默地奉献着，特别是煤矿工人，长年在被称为“两块石头夹一块肉”的地下工作。他们最需要的是精神上的理解、承认和尊重。
    唐家庄煤矿采煤三区给工人记“功劳簿”，使工人的贡献、进步得到肯定，受到尊重，而人体深处的潜能正是由于受尊重而迸发出来。它促使落后者奋进，先进者再争先。
    过去常说，于细微处见精神。做思想政治工作，就要从细微处着手。因为，不可能人人、天天都有那么多大事可做，都有那么多大功可立。而我们这个时代的不少英雄，恰恰是从日常工作中成长起来的，诸如加班几小时，多完成工作量，技改小成果，助人为乐等等。有的人多少年如一日地坚持着。这些事发生在工人身边，人所共知，对这些事的肯定、赞扬，工人最能体会到关怀。
    唐家庄煤矿的“功劳簿”从小中见大，积小事而识人。“功劳簿”用于评先进、选劳模，工人感到平等、服气，选出的劳模就更有影响力。
    政治思想工作不能取巧。唐家庄煤矿的“功劳簿”是种“笨”功夫，日积月累。正是这种贴近工人的笨功夫，在思想政治工作中发挥了作用，是具体、生动的思想政治工作。
      “功劳簿”不埋没职工的功劳，实在是个好办法！
