Throughout this year, some individuals in the United States who hold a arrogant attitude of Western cultural centrism have been gleeful about certain developments in the world. Amidst all the hype, some have even claimed that Western institutions are the culmination of Hegel's "absolute spirit," representing the ultimate and pinnacle form of human society.

Setting aside the philosophical absurdity of such statements, certain facts from American political life can expose the flaws in such grandiose claims.

Recent revelations in American newspapers indicate that the operation of the electoral representative system in the United States is largely lubricated by money. According to a report by the British magazine *The Economist*, the "cost of doing business" (such as campaign expenses) for a seat in the House of Representatives averages $390,000, while for a seat in the Senate, it averages $4 million. As for other various expenses, they are almost impossible to tally.

Money must have a source, and spending money requires fundraising. Although the national elections are still some time away, the Democratic and Republican parties have already been vigorously engaged in fundraising activities. In late October, the Democratic Party held a fundraising gathering in Washington, where each participant was required to contribute $1,500, raising a total of $2.3 million. The party also collected "small" donations by mailing out updated membership cards. The Republican Party, of course, is not lagging behind, busy seeking money through various means. Both parties have similar fundraising methods, such as candidates establishing clubs where those who wish to speak with them must pay an entrance fee of $5,000 or more. This establishes a relationship of mutual exchange between money and politics.

Currently, political fundraising organizations in the United States are thriving. In 1972, there were 113 organizations known as "Political Action Committees" (PACs). Today, that number has increased to 4,268, and the amount of money raised has grown sevenfold, reaching $151 million in the 1987-1988 fiscal year. These organizations aim to seek political influence and often do not have a clear political direction. Sometimes, they engage in dual investments, betting on whichever horse seems to be in favor, to the point where some people have criticized PACs as being "prostitutes." Although the United States has regulations limiting political donations, strategies such as changing names and splitting donations often render these regulations ineffective.

What kind of representatives does this money game produce in Congress? In recent years, scandals in Congress have been rampant, from the Wright scandal to the "Keating Five" scandal, making one recall Mark Twain's words from a century ago: Congress is the only "distinguished criminal class."

The American political system is a product of American history and an integral part that relies on and coexists with its economic and social conditions. A commercialized society inevitably produces commercialized political corruption and various problems, far removed from the "ideal concepts" spoken of, let alone being some perfect ultimate social form. Those with insight should reflect on themselves, clean their own stables, rather than merely boasting. As for those who insist on acting as the world's moral judge, pointing fingers at other countries' affairs, and even meddling, they are even more unworthy of a smile from those with insight.

    从美国的政治金钱游戏谈起
    黄晴
    今年以来，美国某些持西方文化中心主义傲慢态度的人，对世界上的一些事态发展显得兴高采烈。在种种鼓噪声中，有人甚至宣称，西方制度已是黑格尔“绝对精神”的完成，是人类社会的终极形态和顶点。
    这类狂言在哲学上的荒谬性姑且不论，美国现实政治生活中的某些事实即可让这类大话的麒麟皮下露出马脚。
    美国报刊最近披露的一些事实说明，美国的选举代议制度的运行在很大程度上是以金钱为其润滑剂的。据英国《经济学家》杂志报道，当代选举的“行头费”（即宣传费等），众院一个席位平均为39万美元，参院一个席位平均为400万美元。至于其它种种费用，就几乎难予统计了。
    有流必须有源，花钱必须筹款。目前虽离全国大选时日尚远，但民主、共和两党的筹款活动已如火如荼。10月底，民主党在华盛顿召开了每个参加者须缴1500美元的募捐集会，筹得230万美元。该党还通过寄出更新成员证件的方法筹集“小额”捐款。共和党自然也不甘落后，忙于通过种种方式索要金钱。两党也有相同的筹款方式，比如均有候选人开办俱乐部，与之谈话者要交纳5000美元以上的入门费。投桃则须报李，金钱与政治的授受关系由之确立。
    目前，美国的政治捐款组织极为兴旺。1972年，名叫“政治行动委员会”（PAC）的组织有113个，如今已增加到4268个，捐款额也增长了7倍，1987—1988年度高达1.51亿美元。这类组织以寻求政治影响力为目标，往往没有政治定向，有时搞左右逢源，双向投资，哪匹马行情好，就在哪匹马身上下赌注，以至有人大骂“PAC是娼妓”。美国对政治捐款虽有限制规定，但改头换面，化整为零等种种对策往往使上述规定流于形式。
    这种金钱游戏中产生的国会议员成色如何呢？近年来，国会中的丑闻层出不穷，从议长赖特丑闻到“基廷丑闻”，以至让人想起马克·吐温一个世纪前说过的话，国会是唯一“显赫的犯罪阶层”。
    美国政治制度是美国自身历史的产物，是与其经济社会条件互赖共存的一部分。商业化社会势必产生政治的商业化污染和种种弊端，与口头上的“理想观念”相距甚远，更谈不上是什么至善至美的终极社会形态。有识者当能反躬自省，清扫自己的马厩，而不是一味大吹大擂。至于有些人硬充世界道德法官，对别国的事指手划脚，甚至伸手伸脚，那就更不值识者一哂了。
