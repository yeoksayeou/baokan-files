When nightfall slowly descended from the heavens, our car arrived at the Neveţo tourist spot by the Black Sea in Romania. The host insisted on taking us to watch a Romanian folk song and dance performance. After a whole day of travel and visits, although we felt tired, we couldn't refuse the hospitality and followed the host into a nearby "White Horse" tavern.

The tavern was an open-air venue, shaped like a small circular football field. Surrounding it were rooms, and in the center was an open space with a few scattered trees. Sitting indoors, one could see the clear night sky and the twinkling stars. In one corner of the venue, a flat area served as the stage. Apart from a circular walkway, rows of tables and chairs were arranged, and the seats were filled with customers, most of whom were foreign tourists vacationing by the sea.

As we sat down to enjoy some wine and snacks while watching the performance, we felt our fatigue dissipate, replaced by the excitement of the lively atmosphere. Artists dressed in various Romanian national costumes sang and danced on stage. Some audience members voluntarily joined them, singing and dancing with graceful and skilled movements, earning applause from the entire audience and smiles of appreciation from the performers. After one song, many audience members rushed onto the stage, dancing freely to the rhythm of the music.

However, the most interesting part was the folk song medley. Accompanied by a folk music ensemble, the renowned Romanian violinist Baromici performed each song, eliciting enthusiastic responses from the audience. Sometimes, people in one part of the audience would stand up and cheer; sometimes, people in another part would jump up, waving handkerchiefs and flowers; here, people would hold hands and sway to the music; there, someone would sing aloud without a care. The entire audience, regardless of gender or age, was filled with passion, as if in a trance. I, with my limited knowledge of music, initially didn't understand what was happening. It was only when two Chinese folk songs were played, including one that I used to hum as a child, "The Ballad of Mulan," that we stood up and clapped along. However, the audience remained silent, almost all of them looking at us in surprise. I suddenly realized that the artist was performing world folk songs, using his exquisite skills to create a direct emotional resonance with tourists from different countries. The master artist was also moved by this scene of joy and understanding. As soon as his performance ended, he walked around the venue, shaking hands and greeting many audience members.

I specifically asked a Romanian friend if these performers were professional. The answer was that they were not only professional but also members of the Romanian National Art Troupe. It was unexpected to see such high-level performers in a tavern with such simple facilities, without even a proper stage. It is said that over 200 professional art troupes perform in the Black Sea tourist area each year.

When visiting the famous Brasov "Forest Glade," we were immediately greeted by a "hero" dressed in a leather vest and holding a long sword, who led us into a high-legged hero's pavilion made of round logs. Inside, there were wild birds, bottles, jars, wildflowers, wheat ears, animal skins, and handmade decorations, giving off a wild and rustic atmosphere.

According to the custom of the heroes, we ate roasted meat while listening to a small band and heavily made-up female performers singing and playing instruments. The female singer sang and danced with the guests, her graceful and sincere manner making everyone feel at ease, as if they were at home. According to the manager of the "Forest Glade" tourism department, these performers were also professional. They did their best to entertain the tourists and enhance their enjoyment.

From the White Horse tavern by the Black Sea to the hero's pavilion in Brasov, the greatest inspiration is that running a successful tourism industry does not solely depend on luxurious hotels, high-level theaters, and modern tourist facilities. The Romanian tourism department, based on its own actual situation, relies on cost-effective and convenient tourist facilities, rich national characteristics, civilized and thoughtful service, and flexible and diverse management to attract numerous domestic and foreign tourists, making the tourism industry thrive. According to statistics, in 1988, the total number of tourists to Romania reached over 5 million, with 40% from Western Europe and 60% from Eastern Europe. Tourism foreign exchange earnings accounted for 8% of the country's total foreign exchange earnings, and this proportion is still rising.

What is particularly commendable is that Romanian art troupes have blazed a new trail in this regard. Large numbers of art troupes have moved from cities to various tourist areas for performances, not only promoting the development of the tourism industry and increasing national income but also changing the long-standing stagnant situation in the arts by confining them to cities, thus opening up a broad path for the prosperity of the arts.

### 从白马酒馆到侠客棚

    从白马酒馆到侠客棚
    本报记者　顾玉清
    当夜幕从天宇深处徐徐降落的时候，我们的汽车行至罗马尼亚黑海之滨的涅夫托旅游点，主人执意请我们观看罗马尼亚民间歌舞表演。我们经过一整天的奔波访问后，虽感心力劳顿，怎奈盛情难却，还是随主人走进附近的一家“白马”酒馆。
    酒馆是露天的，构造好似一个小小的圆形足球场，周围是房间，中央是空地，地上稀稀拉拉地长着一些树，坐在室内可看到晴朗的夜空，闪闪的星。场地一角平地为舞台，除了一条环形走道外，桌椅排排，顾客满座。他们大多数是到海滨度假的外国游客。
    当我们就座其中边品尝美酒小吃，边观赏演出时，顿觉周身的疲劳一扫而光，而被那热烈的场面所吸引。穿着各式罗马尼亚民族服装的艺术家们在台上轻歌曼舞，观众中也有人主动登台合歌伴舞，动作既洒脱又娴熟，不仅使全场观众为之鼓掌，演员们也向其投以赞美的微笑。一曲终了，舞台上涌入了许多观众，踏着乐曲节奏，各显其态地跳起自由式的舞蹈。
    然而，最有意思的要数民歌大联奏。在民乐队的伴奏下，罗马尼亚著名小提琴家巴洛米各每演奏一首歌曲，都引起热烈反响，观众席上和者成片。一会儿此处的人站起来欢呼鼓掌；一会儿彼处的人蹦起来舞动手中的手帕和鲜花；这里在手拉着手随歌而动；那儿在旁若无人地放声高歌。全场不论男女老少，大都激情奔涌，如醉如狂。我自愧对音乐知之甚少，起初还弄不清怎么回事，直等奏出两首中国民歌，其中一首是我小时候就会哼哼的《孟姜女》时，我们才站起来击掌伴奏。而观众席上却一片沉寂，几乎所有的人都以惊奇的目光看着我们，我恍然大悟。原来，这位艺术家演奏的是世界民歌曲，他以自己精湛的演技与来自不同歌曲故乡的各国游客之间产生了直接的感情共鸣。艺术大师也被这种欢腾与理解的场景所感动。他的节目演出一结束，就绕场一周与许多观众一一握手致意。
    我特地问了一下罗马尼亚朋友，这些演员是否是专业的，得到的回答是，他们不仅是专业的，而且都是罗国家艺术团的。如此高级别的演员在设备这样简陋、连舞台都没有的小酒馆里演出，这是我们未曾料想到的。据说，每年到黑海旅游区进行这类演出的专业艺术团就有200多个。
    在访问著名的布拉索夫“林间空地”时，我们刚到就被一位身着皮马甲，手举一把长长利剑的“侠客”引进了用圆木搭成的高脚侠客棚。里面挂满了野鸡、瓶子、罐子、野花、麦穗、兽皮和手工编织的饰物等，野味十足。
    按照侠客的习惯，我们吃着烤肉，听着小乐队和浓妆艳抹的女演员弹奏演唱。女歌手边唱边走过来纤手轻轻地与客人携手起舞，举止之大方，感情之真挚，使人消除了拘束，有宾至如归之感。据“林间空地”旅游部的经理介绍，这些演员也都是专业的，他们根据需要，想方设法向游客推销愉快，以助游兴。
    从黑海之滨的白马酒馆到布拉索夫的侠客棚，给人最大的启迪是，办好旅游并非全凭豪华的宾馆、高级剧院和现代化的旅游场所。罗马尼亚旅游部门从自己的实际情况出发，靠省钱方便的旅游设施、浓厚的民族特色、文明周到的服务、灵活多样的经营，照样能吸引许许多多的国内外游客，把旅游事业办得火红。据统计，1988年到罗马尼亚旅游的总人数达500多万，其中，西欧的旅游者占40％，东欧占60％，旅游外汇收入可占全国外汇总收入的8％，且这一比例还在上升。
    尤其令人赞赏的是，罗马尼亚艺术团体在这方面走出了一条新路子。大批文艺团体从城市走向全国各旅游区巡回演出，这样，不仅促进了旅游业的发展，为国家增加了收入，而且改变了文艺界长期困守城市的萧条处境，为繁荣艺术事业开拓了广阔的道路。图为罗马尼亚文艺团体在地方演出的情景。
