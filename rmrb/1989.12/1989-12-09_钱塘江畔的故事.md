    Stories from the Banks of the Qiantang River
    Lin Yinan, Zheng Yunshi

    Preface: Engels once said, “When the peasants and handicraft workers of the 18th century were drawn into large-scale industry, they changed their entire way of life and became completely different people. Similarly, the common management of production by the entire society and the new development of production that results from it also require a completely new kind of person and will create such a person.” The current wave of reform is driving the development of industrial production in our country and is also changing the lives of many people, changing their spiritual outlook. A new generation of workers is emerging. The story we want to tell here is a true one that took place on the banks of the Qiantang River:

    I
    There are still ten minutes before the start of the workday. Young and strong male and female workers dressed in green work uniforms rush into the workshop, standing neatly in front of a modern production assembly line, resembling a well-trained squad ready for drill.

    “Ding, ding, ding…” As soon as the work bell rings, the assembly line starts moving, and the workers, as if hearing a command, begin to work in unison: drilling, wiring, assembling, welding… You see pairs of agile and dexterous hands moving and jumping frequently. Drills, blow dryers, welding guns, and other tools make various sounds, as if playing a tense yet harmonious symphony. From numerous scattered parts to a complete product, through dozens of processes, the rapid assembly at a rushing pace, the smooth workflow, and the seamless, precise operation of the workers, all of which are truly astonishing, making one's eyes dizzy.

    This is the final assembly workshop of the Huari Refrigerator Factory.

    Workshop director Wang Abin took us on a tour of the workshop. He told us, “Modern production equipment requires each worker to have strict discipline and a sense of the whole. The time for each process is strictly regulated to the second. If anyone delays even a few seconds, the part they are supposed to work on will flow past them, causing trouble for the next process and even the entire line. It's like a piano with a broken key, which can no longer play a complete melody.”

    “How did you train this young team?” we asked.

    “It wasn't easy!” Wang Abin sighed, “Our factory was established in 1984, and more than a thousand employees, most of whom were recruited from the countryside of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Heilongjiang. Our workshop is the same, with about 90 people, 60% of whom are peasant workers. Their strengths are their simplicity and hard work, but their weaknesses are a lack of organization and discipline. Some of them are used to the freedom of the countryside, going to work with the sunrise and resting with the sunset. Suddenly, they find themselves in front of fast-moving machines and find it hard to adapt, causing a lot of trouble. But with proper education and training, they can change quickly.” Saying this, he led us to a young worker and introduced him, “His name is Liu Shanghua, and he was recruited from Anhui countryside.”

    We looked at this stocky young man from the side: his hair was messy and disheveled, his rugged and resolute face exuded a vigorous and martial spirit, and he had a small mustache on his lips, giving him a stubborn look. At this moment, he was holding an electric blow dryer, blowing up and down on the refrigerator door frame to make the seal stick more firmly. His movements were light and agile, and he was fully concentrated, to the extent that we stood by him for a long time and he didn't notice us.

    “How is he doing?” Wang Abin asked us with a smile.

    “Very well,” we praised.

    “It was he who caused a lot of trouble just a few months ago,” Abin said, leading us to the workshop office and telling us Liu Shanghua's story...

    II
    Liu Shanghua is from a mountainous area in southern Anhui. He has a strong build and is intelligent, but he tends to be ambitious and lacks focus. He has farmed, done small businesses, and even worked as a barber in a small town, but he never stuck with any of them.

    When he heard that the Huari Refrigerator Factory in Hangzhou was recruiting workers in his hometown, Liu Shanghua was overjoyed. He had read in the newspaper that the Huari Refrigerator Factory is a large factory producing 300,000 refrigerators a year, with its products ranking at the top in several national evaluations. The factory is also located in the famous scenic area of “Heaven above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.” Where else could he find such a good factory and such a good place? The well-informed Liu Shanghua eagerly rushed to the town to sign up and was lucky enough to pass the exam.

    When he bid farewell to his parents and came from the remote mountains of southern Anhui to this beautiful southern city, to the banks of the Qiantang River, and to the grand gate of the Huari Refrigerator Factory, he looked up and saw: the tall factory buildings standing in a sea of green fields, the rows of large glass windows glistening in the sun, how majestic! The men and women workers coming in and out, dressed in green work uniforms, how impressive! The more he looked, the more he was captivated, and his feet hesitated to step over the threshold. He couldn't believe that luck would suddenly descend upon him, that his ideal job and ideal place would be so easily obtained.

    After a period of training, the new workers mainly familiarized themselves with the factory's production processes and various regulations, and mastered basic production skills. Liu Shanghua stood out, and every item reached the qualification standard first. When he first put on the green work uniform, he was so excited that he immediately rushed to a photo studio in Hangzhou to take a picture and sent it along with a letter to his parents in his hometown: “Dad, Mom, your son has now become a modern worker…” However, he was too naive, and the ship of life would not be so smooth!

    He was assigned to the final assembly workshop. Workshop director Wang Abin, considering that he was new and perhaps also considering that he had previously worked as a barber, gave him a relatively simple task: sticking door seals. The task was to stick the door seal on the door frame and then continuously blow it up and down with an electric blow dryer to soften the adhesive with the heat, making it stick more firmly.

    Is that all? Too easy! Liu Shanghua held the electric blow dryer and laughed, starting to work happily. But after a few days, the novelty and excitement of being in the factory gradually faded, and the smile that had been on his face all day gradually disappeared. He never imagined that once he was pinned to this process, his body would be tied up like a rope, and he wouldn't be able to move. During work, he couldn't think about anything else for a moment, and every day he was so tired that he couldn't catch his breath, even going to the bathroom seemed to have someone following, urging, and rushing him (there was a mobile worker temporarily replacing him). The electric blow dryer in his hand was regulated to blow a door frame for a few minutes and a few seconds. If his movements were a little slow, it was either the previous process worker urging, “Quick, quick!” or the next process worker shouting, “Hey, what's wrong?” It was so annoying. In his hometown barbershop, he could blow the dryer for as long as he wanted, working happily and tiringly. Who would have thought that he would become a caged bird here, a prisoner-like being controlled by others?

    Liu Shanghua also had a bad habit: he was addicted to smoking. The factory regulations prohibited smoking in the production area. He struggled with all his might for two days and then couldn't hold back any longer. His throat felt like it was on fire, like a knife was stabbing him, his eyes were blurry, and his head was dizzy, more unbearable than not drinking water or eating. To hell with the regulations! When Abin wasn't around, he secretly took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and was discovered by the workshop manager Xie Chunhui, who fined him 50 cents. He laughed, 50 cents, what's that? It's like giving a friend a “Jinpai” cigarette; the second time, he was fined one yuan, and he still didn't mind, thinking, it's like losing a pack of “Donghai” cigarettes in a poker game in his hometown. Then it was fined 2 yuan, 3 yuan, 4 yuan... He couldn't take it anymore, like this, his salary would be fined away, no eating, no drinking?

    One day after work, he dragged his tired body back to the dormitory, threw himself on the bed, and smoked one cigarette after another, wanting to make up for all the cigarettes he hadn't smoked during work. He also had a bad habit of smoking: he didn't like to tap the ashes into the ashtray. At this moment, he just stretched out a hand from the bed, letting the ashes with sparks fall randomly on the ground and shoes. His clothes, shoes, and even his quilt were full of small black holes burned by cigarette ashes.

    He sipped the smoke, and his thoughts were in turmoil. He began to miss his hometown and the free life in the countryside. He remembered that even during the “eating from the big pot” era, although the team leader rang the bell every day to drive everyone to work, once in the field, as long as the team leader wasn't around, he could lie down under the tree and sleep a big sleep, and no one cared about him. When the production responsibility system was implemented, it was even freer. He could get up whenever he wanted, work whenever he wanted, and no one could control him or manage him. It was not like here, standing like a wooden man by the machine all day, turning a big living person into a machine... He closed his eyes, and in a daze, he suddenly found himself standing in the fields of his hometown, with the warm breeze blowing his clothes. He vaguely remembered the words of Tao Yuanming's “Returning to the Fields”: “The boat is light and far away, the wind blows and the clothes flutter…” He felt extremely refreshed. “Shanghua, come, let's play a few rounds.” It was his childhood friend inviting him to play poker. Under the ancient tree, they kept playing, smoking freely, laughing so hard that they fell over... In short, he had returned to that carefree life.

    “Shanghua, the cigarette is burning your shoes!” His roommate woke him up, and he found that he had just dozed off, had a short dream, and the unfinished cigarette had fallen from his fingers onto his shoe...

    III
    The factory director Chen Yongxiang, deputy directors Chen Lijun and Chen Fuxiang, and middle-level cadres such as Wang Abin thought of many ways to manage these peasant workers. In addition to establishing detailed factory rules and regulations and penalty systems, the more important thing was to integrate ideological and political work into management work throughout the process. They proposed the “unity and hard work” spirit of Huari, to strengthen cohesion; they proposed that the factory should be like “warm and wise glue” to stick to the hearts of every peasant worker. For Liu Shanghua's smoking problem, Abin had talked to him three times: repeatedly explaining how smoking in the production area would affect production safety and refrigerator quality. “Even a tiny bit of cigarette ash falling on the seal will cause the refrigerator door to not seal properly, and the quality will be greatly affected. Have you considered this?”

    Liu Shanghua was a reasonable person, and he finally overcame the habit of smoking in the workshop.

    However, just as one wave subsided, another wave rose.

    Each person in the workshop had a toolbox, and according to the factory regulations, only production tools could be placed in the box, and personal items could not be placed. One day after work, the workshop manager Xie Chunhui checked Liu Shanghua's toolbox and found that not only were the tools placed in a mess, but also meal tickets, cigarettes, playing cards, and chess pieces were scattered all over the box. “You violated the employee code of conduct, Article 58. According to the rules, you should be fined, but since it's your first offense, I'll let you off this time. If you do it again, don't blame me for not being nice.”

    Not long ago, Xie Chunhui had fined Liu Shanghua several times for smoking, and Liu Shanghua's anger had not subsided. Now he came to find his “trouble,” and he couldn't bear it, glaring at him and retorting, “Don't be so nosy.”

    “How is it being nosy? Violating the rules is to be managed!”

    “Manage, manage, manage!” Liu Shanghua was so angry that he stepped forward and shouted at Xie Chunhui, “You can't even manage a woman, let alone me!”

    One sentence, like a knife, stabbed Xie Chunhui's sore spot, and he turned pale, tears streaming down his face. Xie Chunhui was from Qiantang Lake in Zhejiang and had been recruited a year earlier than Liu Shanghua. In his hometown, he had a very beautiful girlfriend, and he had deep feelings for her, almost to the point of marriage. However, the girl suddenly changed her mind. When he heard the news, Xie Chunhui cried bitterly, almost unable to bear the pain. Friends around him comforted him in various ways, and his mood gradually stabilized. He never expected that today, Liu Shanghua's words would touch his past love wound again, and he couldn't bear the insult, picking up a deck of cards from Liu Shanghua's toolbox and throwing it to the ground, the card case broke, and the cards scattered like fallen leaves.

    “Son of a bitch!” Liu Shanghua roared, pouncing on him and grabbing Xie Chunhui's collar, Xie Chunhui then grabbed Liu Shanghua's hair; Liu Shanghua suddenly swept his leg, knocking Xie Chunhui to the ground, and he himself also fell down, the two rolling on the ground, fighting fiercely. Fortunately, the workers rushed over in time and pulled them apart.

    The fight between the workers in the final assembly workshop became a big news in the factory.

    Soon, the factory implemented optimization, and many people advocated that Liu Shanghua should be optimized out. But Abin disagreed, believing that Liu Shanghua was capable, although he had violated the discipline, it was caused by not adapting when he first came. As long as he was guided and helped to change his lazy habits from the countryside, he would become a good worker.

    Unfortunately, before a final decision was made on whether to keep Liu Shanghua or not, Liu Shanghua heard the news and left without saying a word. Before leaving, he only left a note on Abin's desk: “Teacher Abin, since many people don't want me now, I won't stay here either. I'm leaving, thank you for your past cultivation and education…”

    IV
    Liu Shanghua returned to his hometown—the small mountain village in southern Anhui.

    He lied to his mother, saying that he had worked in the factory for half a year and was on leave to visit his mother.

    The next day, he sat alone in the house, feeling bored, and didn't want to see his childhood friends who played poker with him, so he walked to the edge of his contracted field. It was early summer, and the rice plants were growing lush and green, but there were many weeds in the field. He was about to take off his shoes and socks and go into the field to pull out the weeds. But he didn't take them off and sat down on the embankment, feeling lonely and melancholic. He suddenly realized that he was no longer the Liu Shanghua of half a year ago, and his emotions had changed in some way. In the disciplined factory, he missed the free life in the fields of his hometown, but when he returned to the fields, he missed the Huari Refrigerator Factory. He missed the teachers who taught him technology tirelessly, he missed the new friends he had just made, and he missed the new life there. He regretted his rash actions towards Xie Chunhui.

    He believed that the factory would not forgive him and would “optimize” him out. He was afraid that the factory would send a notice to his home: Liu Shanghua has repeatedly violated the discipline, caused trouble, and has been expelled from the factory... Then, his parents would scold him for being useless, and his fellow villagers would laugh at him for being worthless. What reputation would he have in his hometown in the future?

    He buried his head between his knees and cried.

    “Shanghua, Shanghua!” Suddenly, someone called him. He looked up in surprise and saw that it was Teacher Abin walking towards him on the embankment.

    “I was just going to your house to find you, and when I saw you sitting here, I took a detour,” Abin said with a smile. Liu Shanghua quickly stood up, feeling both happy and a bit fearful, afraid that Abin was coming to give him the final notice.

    “Shanghua, the factory has not optimized you out, and you are still in the final assembly workshop.”

    “You still want me?!” Shanghua couldn't believe it.

    “Who said they don't want you? The workers, including Xie Chunhui, are all looking forward to your return.” Saying this, Abin took out a letter from Xie Chunhui to Shanghua, and Shanghua quickly opened it to see a few lines of elegant small characters jumping into his eyes: “Shanghua, I was also wrong, my work method was too rigid, I'm sorry to you, welcome back…”

    A warm current immediately spread throughout his body.

    “Shanghua, I believe you will change your bad habits and become an excellent worker, come back with me.”

    “Teacher!” Liu Shanghua suddenly hugged Abin, tears in his eyes, saying, “I was wrong, I will change…”

    Wang Abin finished telling the story and took me to the final assembly workshop. He pointed to the rows of workers who were operating intensively and said, “From yesterday's peasants to today's workers, they have all experienced a stage of adaptation, like Liu Shanghua. For them, relying on rewards and punishments is not enough, but we must also patiently do ideological work, care for them, guide them, and educate them.”

    We looked at this new army of peasants in front of us, who were quickly transforming into workers with their own sweat, and Engels' statement that “large-scale industry changes people's entire way of life and completely transforms them into another kind of person” echoed in our ears again…

    钱塘江畔的故事
    林伊南  郑云石
    小引：恩格斯说过：“当18世纪的农民和手工工场工人被吸引到大工业中以后，他们改变了自己的整个生活方式而完全成为另一种人。同样，用整个社会的力量来共同经营生产和由此而引起的生产的新发展，也需要一种全新的人，并将创造出这种新人来……”当前的改革大潮，推动着我国工业生产的发展，也在改变着许多人的生活方式，改变着他们的精神面貌。一批农工正在成长。我们在这里要讲述的正是这样一个发生在钱塘江畔的真实的故事：
    一
    离上班时间还有10分钟，身着草绿色工装的年轻力壮的男女工人，便带着一路小跑涌进车间，齐刷刷在一条现代化生产流水线面前站好，看去酷似一列训练有素、等待出操的士兵。
    “叮叮叮……”开工的铃声刚响过，生产流水线即刻流动起来，工人们仿佛听到一声号令，一齐开始动作：钻孔的钻孔，接线的接线，安装的安装，焊接的焊接……只见一双双灵巧麻利的手在频频地挥动、跳跃。钻孔机、吹风机、焊枪等竞相发出各种不同的声响，像在合奏着一支紧张而和谐的交响曲。从众多零散的部件到一台完整的成品，数十道工序之间，那急流奔涌般的快节奏组装，那畅通无阻的工序流程，以及工人们天衣无缝，分秒不差的衔接和他们准确敏捷的操作技术，着实令人惊叹，看得使人眼花缭乱。
    这便是华日电冰箱厂的总装车间。
    车间主任王阿斌带着我们在车间参观。他告诉我们：“现代化的生产设备要求每个工人必须有严格的纪律和整体观念。每道工序所用时间，一分一秒都规定好了，假如谁稍稍延误几秒钟，该你做的部件就会从你的面前流走，就会给下道乃至整道工序造成麻烦。好比一架钢琴坏了一个琴键，再弹不出一支完整的曲子一样。”
    “你们怎么训练好这支年轻队伍的？”我们问。
    “不容易呀！”王阿斌感叹说，“我们厂1984年建厂，千余名职工大部分是从浙江、江西、安徽、黑龙江等省份的农村招来的。我们车间也是这样，90来个人，60％是农民工，他们的长处是纯朴、肯干，短处是缺乏组织纪律性，有些人在农村散漫惯了，从日出而作，日入而息的田野猝然来到这快节奏的机器旁，很不适应，闹了好些风波，但只要教育训练得当，他们转变起来也是很快的。”说着，他把我带到一位年轻工人身旁，介绍道：“他叫刘尚华，是从安徽农村招来的。”
    我们从侧面看着这个矮壮的农村小伙：一头蓬松凌乱的头发，粗犷、坚毅的脸上透出一股英武的朝气，唇上蓄着一撮傲慢的小胡子。一看就是个犟小子。此刻，他正手持电吹风，紧贴冰箱门框上下吹个不停，以使门封条沾附得更为牢固。他的动作轻便灵巧，全神贯注，以致我们站在他身边半天他也没有发现。
    “他干得怎么样？”王阿斌笑笑问我们。
    “很捧。”我们称赞说。
    “就是他，几个月前还闹得不可开交呢。”阿斌把我们带到车间办公室，向我谈了这个刘尚华的故事……
    二
    刘尚华的家在皖南一个山区。他有一副好身板，人也聪明，就是有点好高骛远，做事不专。他种过田，做过小买卖，还当过一阵小镇的理发员，但哪一样也没有干到底。
    听说杭州华日电冰箱厂来他们家乡招工，刘尚华高兴极了。他从报上看到过：华日冰箱厂是个年产30万台冰箱的大厂，产品几次在国内评选中名列前茅。厂址又在“上有天堂、下有苏杭”的著名风景区杭州。哪里再去挑这样好的厂子，这样好的地方？消息灵通的他兴冲冲第一个抢先跑到乡上报了名，不想一考就考取了。
    当他告别父母，从偏僻的皖南山沟来到这座景色迷人的南方大城市，来到钱塘江畔的华日电冰箱厂漂亮的大门前，抬起眼睛一看，果然：那耸立在一片碧绿田野上的米黄色的高大厂房，那在骄阳下闪灼着白光的一排排大玻璃窗，多有气魄！那进进出出，穿着一色的草绿色夹克式工装的男女工人，多么威风！他越看越着迷，脚有点不敢迈进门槛。他不敢相信，幸运会如此突然降临到他的头上，他梦寐以求的理想的工作、理想的地方会如此轻易获得。
    新工人经过一段时间培训，主要是熟悉厂里的生产过程和各项规章制度，掌握初步的生产技能。刘尚华成绩突出，每一项都率先达到合格标准。当他第一次穿上那套草绿色工装时，兴奋得马上跑到杭州一家照相馆照了张相，连同一封信寄给了家乡的父母：“爸爸妈妈，你的儿子现在已经成为一名现代工人了……”然而他想得太天真了，生活的航船那会如此一帆风顺！
    他被分配在总装车间工作。车间主任王阿斌考虑到他初来乍到，也许还考虑到他过去当过理发员，便把一道较简单的工序——贴门封条交给他。这道工序的任务是把门封条贴上门框后，不断用电吹风上下吹，利用吹出的热力软化胶条，使之沾附得更加牢固。
    就这？太容易了！刘尚华拿着电吹风咧嘴嘻嘻笑着，开始干得蛮开心。但是几天下来，他初进工厂那种新鲜感兴奋劲便渐渐消退了，整日挂在脸上的笑容也渐渐不见了。他万万没有想到：一旦自己被钉在这道工序上，身子就像被一根绳索五花大绑，再也动弹不得了。上班时片刻都不容你胡思乱想，每天8小时累得你换不过一口气，连上厕所也好像有人跟着、逼着、催着（上厕所有机动工临时代干）；电吹风拿在手上，规定几分几秒吹一只门框，假如动作慢一点，不是上道工序的人催：“快，快呀！”就是下道工序的人喊：“喂喂，怎么回事？”烦死人了。老子在家乡的理发店吹风，高兴吹多久就吹多久，干得顺心，累得也痛快。谁像在这儿变成笼中鸟，囚犯似的受人管制？
    刘尚华还有一个毛病：嗜烟成性。工厂规定生产场地禁止抽烟。他费了九牛二虎之力憋了两天，就再也忍耐不住了。喉咙里像火一样烧，像刀子一样扎，眼睛发花，脑袋发晕，比不喝水不吃饭还难熬。去他的，什么规定不规定，不管他，抽！趁阿斌不在，他偷偷从口袋里掏出一支烟，点着了，不料被车间管理员斜春晖发现，罚款5角。他嘿嘿一笑，5角算啥？等于扔给朋友一支“键牌”；第二次，罚款一元，他仍不在乎，心想，老子就好比在家乡甩扑克输了一包“东海”罢了，接着是罚2元、3元、4元……他受不住了，这样下去，工资都要被罚完，不吃饭啦？不喝酒啦？
    一天下班，他拖着疲惫的身子回到集体宿舍，往床上一倒，一支接一支大口地吸烟，恨不得把上班时未抽的烟一下子补回来。他抽烟还有一个毛病，不习惯将烟灰弹在烟灰缸里，此刻，他就那么从床上伸出一只手，让带着火星的烟灰胡乱掉到地上、鞋子上。他的衣裤、鞋帮子乃至被子上，到处有烟灰烧出的小黑洞。
    他丝丝地吸着烟，思想斗争很激烈。他开始怀念家乡，怀念家乡那自由自在的生活了。他记得，即使是吃“大锅饭”的年月，虽然队长每天敲钟赶大家去上工，但到了地里，只要队长不在，老子就可以躺在树荫下睡大觉，谁也不管你。到推行生产承包责任制，那就更自由了。老子爱什么时候起床就什么时候起床，想什么时候干活就什么时候干活，谁也别想管，谁也管不着。哪像这里，整天木头似的站在机器旁，把一个大活人变成了机器……他闭上眼睛，迷迷胡胡中忽然发现自己不知不觉站在了故乡的田野上，温暖的和风吹拂着他的衣衫。他隐隐约约又记起了上中学时读过的陶渊明的《归去来辞》：“舟遥遥以轻飏，风飘飘而吹衣……”顿感舒爽极了。“尚华，来，甩几盘。”是童年伙伴在邀他打扑克。古树下，他们一个劲地甩呀，自由自在的抽烟呀，笑得前仰后合……总之，他又过上了那种无拘无束的生活。
    “尚华，烟烧着鞋子罗！”同室的工友把他摇醒，他才发现自己刚才打了一个盹，做了一个短短的梦，未抽完的烟从手指间掉到了鞋上……
    三
    华日电冰箱厂厂长陈永祥，副厂长陈励君、陈福祥以及王阿斌等中层干部，为了管理好这些农民工，想了许多办法，除了订立详细的各项厂规厂法和偿罚制度外，更重要的，是把思想政治工作贯串于管理工作的始终。他们提出了“团结一致，艰苦创业”的华日精神，以增强凝聚力；他们提出了工厂要像“温暖而智慧的胶水”一样沾住每个农民工的心。为了刘尚华的抽烟问题，阿斌曾三次找他谈话：反复说明生产场地抽烟如何会妨碍生产的安全和电冰箱的质量。“只要一星点烟灰掉到胶条上，冰箱门就无法密封，质量就大受影响，你考虑了这个厉害关系没有？”
    刘尚华是明事理的，在车间抽烟的毛病到底克服了。
    然而一波刚平，一波又起。
    车间每人有个工具箱，按厂里规定，箱内只能定位放生产用具，不能放个人用品。一天刚下班，车间管理员斜春晖来检查刘尚华的工具箱，发现里面不仅工具放得乱七八糟，而且饭菜票、香烟、扑克、象棋等横七竖八塞满一箱子。“你违反了员工守则第58条，按理要罚款，念你是初犯，算了，下次再犯，就别怪我不客气了。”斜春晖警告说。
    前不久，斜春晖连罚了刘尚华几次烟款，刘尚华火气还未消，现在又来找他的“岔子”，他哪里忍耐得住，大眼一瞪顶撞道：“你不要管得太宽了。”
    “怎么是管得宽，违反了规定就是要管！”
    “管管管！”刘尚华气冲脑门，猛然逼近一步朝斜春晖吼道：“你连个女人也管不住，还配管我！”
    一句话，像刀尖一样扎着斜春晖的痛处，他顿时面色惨白，泪如泉涌。斜春晖是浙江千岛湖人，比刘尚华早招来一年多。在家乡，他曾有个非常漂亮的女朋友，他对她感情很深，都快结婚了，哪知姑娘突然变心。闻此讯，斜春晖嚎啕大哭，几乎痛不欲生。周围的朋友多方劝慰，他的心绪才渐渐安定下来，没想到今天刘尚华的一句话，又触动了他往日爱情的创伤，再也受不了这口气，抓起刘尚华工具箱里的一副扑克，“拍”地朝地下一摔，扑克盒摔碎了，扑克牌落叶似地撒满一地。
    “王八蛋！”刘尚华大吼一声，扑上去一把揪住斜春晖的衣领，斜春晖则顺势揪住刘尚华的头发；刘尚华猛地一个扫荡腿，一下把斜春晖扫倒在地，自己也跟着倒了下去，两人在地下翻来滚去，打得难解难分。幸亏工人们及时赶到，将两人强行拉开了。
    总装车间工人打架，成了厂里的一大新闻。
    不久，厂里执行优化组合，许多人主张将刘尚华优化掉。但阿斌不同意，认为刘尚华能干，虽犯了纪律，是初来时不适应造成的。只要加强引导，让他改掉农村带来的漫散习气，他会成为一名好工人的。
    可惜，对刘尚华留与不留还未作最后定论，刘尚华却闻到风声，不告而别了。临走，只在阿斌的桌上留了张纸条：“阿斌师傅，现在既然很多人不要我了，我也不会赖在这里。我走了，感谢您过去对我的培养教育……”
    四
    刘尚华又回到了家乡——皖南那个小山村。
    他向妈妈撒了一个谎，说他在工厂干了半年，是请假回来看妈妈的。
    第二天，他一个人坐在屋子里闷得慌，也不想去见他那些一起甩扑克的童年伙伴，便信步来到他家那块承包田边。时当初夏，正在拔节的水稻长得墨绿可爱，只是田里长了不少杂草。他正想脱掉鞋袜下田拔草。可是他没有脱，而是在田塍上坐下来，心里有一种孤独和惆怅之感。他忽然发觉，自己似乎不是半年前的刘尚华了，感情已经起了某种变化。在纪律严明的工厂，他怀念家乡田野无拘无束的生活，但回到田野，他又怀念那个华日电冰箱厂了。他怀念那里孜孜不倦教他学技术的师傅，他怀念那些新结识的工人伙伴，怀念那里的新生活。他为自己对斜春晖的鲁莽行动感到深深的后悔。
    他认定，工厂不会原谅他的，会把他“优化”掉。他怕工厂向他家里发来通知：刘尚华屡犯纪律，打架生事，已被工厂除名……那样，父母会骂他不争气，乡亲们会笑他没出息。他今后在家乡还有什么威信？
    他把头埋在两膝中间，哭了。
    “尚华，尚华！”忽然有人喊他。他抬头一看，大吃一惊，竟是阿斌师傅从田塍上向他走来。
    “我正想到你家里去找你，看你坐在这里，便弯路来了。”阿斌笑嘻嘻说。刘尚华赶忙站起身。既欢喜又有些恐惧，怕阿斌是来下最后通牒的。
    “尚华，厂里没有优化掉你，你还组合在总装车间。”
