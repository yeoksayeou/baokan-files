Title: Too Many Launch Ceremonies

An editor from a newspaper's literary section was invited to attend several book launch ceremonies in three consecutive days. He mentioned that receiving ten or eight invitations per month is quite common!

In my humble opinion, in this age of information explosion, it is reasonable to promote a truly valuable work appropriately, disseminate information, and expand its influence. The problem now is that there are too many launch ceremonies. Some authors and publishers are eager to organize "launch ceremonies," even going to the extent of printing invitations, preparing venues, buying refreshments, and inviting celebrities. They believe that this will enhance the book's value. According to a friend, some books that have had launch ceremonies are indeed good, but there are also some that are far from impressive.

I have not researched the origin of launch ceremonies. In my guess, when "Dream of the Red Chamber" was published, there probably was no launch ceremony, but it has remained popular since its publication and has been translated into several foreign languages. Tolstoy's "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina," and "Resurrection" did not have any launch ceremonies, but they have become timeless classics admired by the world. From this, it can be seen that whether a book is loved by readers does not depend on the ceremonies held for it, but on the quality of the book. If a book lacks substance, trying to compensate with external efforts is futile. No matter how grand the ceremony, readers will see through the true face of the book.

    “首发式”何其多
    王登平
    一家报社文艺版的编辑接连三天被人拉去参加几本书的首发式。据他说，每个月收到十份、八份请柬是常有的事！
    依笔者愚见，在信息爆炸的今天，一部确有重要价值的佳作问世，适当作点宣传，传播信息，扩大影响，是无可非议的。现在的问题是，首发式太多太滥。有些书作者和出版社，热衷于组织“首发式”，甚至不惜工本，印请柬、备会场、购饮料，费尽周折去请名人……他们以为这样就会提高书的身价。据朋友介绍，有些举行了首发式的书的内容确实不错，但也有些实在不敢恭维。
    我对首发式的来源没有考证。据我揣摩，《红楼梦》出版时，大概没搞什么首发式，但它问世以来，经久不衰，还被翻译成数种外国文字。俄国作家托尔斯泰的《战争与和平》、《安娜·卡列尼娜》、《复活》等，也没有举行什么首发式，但终究成为世人推崇的传世之作。由此看来，一本书能否受到读者的喜爱，不在于为它搞了什么仪式，而在于书的质量。书内功夫不行，企图靠书外功夫来弥补，即便搞得再热闹，读者也会识破“庐山真面目”的。
