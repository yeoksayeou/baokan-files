AIDS has become a global infectious disease, and this year it has shown a further spread. According to statistics released by the World Health Organization on November 3, by the end of October 1989, 186,000 cases of AIDS patients had been discovered in 152 countries around the world. In reality, the number of AIDS patients worldwide is far greater than this figure, estimated to be as high as 600,000. As for virus carriers, the number is even more significant, estimated to be between 6 million and 8 million. If the current trend continues, by the end of this century, the number of AIDS patients will reach 6 million, and the number of virus carriers will be between 12 million and 24 million.

More seriously, AIDS poses a greater threat to children's lives than to adults. According to a recent press conference held by the World Health Organization's Commission for the Conquest of AIDS in Paris, France has more than 500 newborns infected with the AIDS virus each year, the United States has 150,000, and Africa has even more. The primary carriers of the virus to children are their mothers. The incidence rate of infected children is 80%, far exceeding that of adults. Currently, there are approximately 2 million pregnant women worldwide carrying the AIDS virus.

AIDS is wreaking havoc in some countries in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. Among these, the country with the highest number of AIDS patients is the United States, with 107,308 cases, accounting for 57% of the global total. According to relevant departments in the United States, by the end of 1991, the number of AIDS patients in the United States will reach 270,000, of whom 179,000 will die from the disease. The severity of AIDS can be compared to the "Black Death" that swept through Europe in the mid-14th century, which caused approximately one-third of Europe's population to die. The Secretary-General of the World Health Organization has expressed deep concern, saying, "We are now standing naked before the most serious and fatal infectious disease in history... We have all underestimated this situation."

Over the past year, scientists and experts have made some new progress in the development of AIDS treatment drugs, but they are still in the experimental stage.

Most experts and scholars believe that the most effective way to curb the further spread of AIDS is education. According to the person in charge of the World Health Organization's global plan to combat AIDS, almost every country in the world has now formulated an educational plan on how to prevent and treat AIDS. The educational methods in various countries are diverse and increasingly widespread.

The U.S. government, to prevent the rapid spread of AIDS, has begun mailing handbooks on AIDS transmission and prevention to the entire population. To print and distribute this 8-page propaganda brochure, approximately $17 million is required.

Now, 17 states in the United States have authorized schools to conduct AIDS prevention and treatment education. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has formulated guidelines on how to conduct AIDS prevention and treatment education in various types of schools. Connecticut and Florida states have stipulated that public schools must offer courses on AIDS prevention and treatment knowledge. Their propaganda methods are diverse, including lectures, slides, films, and discussions, and basic knowledge of AIDS prevention has been widely popularized.

The U.S. government also passed a bill this year to prevent the spread of AIDS. The new law plans to allocate $400 million annually for national, especially for those who frequently come into contact with the AIDS virus, testing and prevention, using simple and easy-to-understand language to conduct sex education, and widely selling contraceptives.

France is the country with the most AIDS patients in Europe. According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization, the number of patients has reached 7,149. To vigorously promote the prevention of AIDS nationwide, the French government has decided to allocate 100 million francs, of which 55 million francs will be used for advertising, and a coordinating body will be established in the Ministry of Health to coordinate the government's various departments' work on AIDS prevention and education. The United Kingdom and West Germany have distributed tens of millions of propaganda materials on AIDS prevention knowledge nationwide. West Germany's slogan is "AIDS concerns everyone."

Brazil, severely affected by AIDS, had 9,300 patients by November this year, making it the country with the second-highest number of patients worldwide, second only to the United States. Currently, the Brazilian government is using films, television, radio, and posters in public places to promote the dangers of AIDS and discuss prevention methods.

By the end of September this year, the number of AIDS patients on the African continent had exceeded 31,000. The Acting Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity called on youth to educate themselves and vigorously promote the dangers of AIDS.

The spread of AIDS is not only a scientific issue but also a social issue. To a large extent, it is a disease caused by lifestyle. Therefore, propaganda and education have played an active role in preventing the spread of AIDS. According to a survey by the World Health Organization, people's behavior and habits have changed through propaganda and education. For example, "the change is very obvious among those seeking pleasure in Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Amsterdam, London, New York, and San Francisco." In Nairobi, Kenya, and Accra, Ghana, due to the recent implementation of AIDS prevention plans, people have begun to regulate their sexual behavior. The phenomenon of intravenous drug use in Western countries such as the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands has also changed. Now, more and more British people are tending towards stricter moral concepts and condemning homosexual behavior; the social life and moral customs of Americans are also changing, with more people advocating for a monogamous family system; 76% of French citizens are willing to accept prior notification of AIDS testing; about 50% of AIDS virus carriers in Italy have chosen to have abortions to avoid giving birth to unfortunate children.

The struggle of humanity against this demon of AIDS will be long-term. It is gratifying that more and more people are beginning to realize its harm and are taking action to join the fight against AIDS.

    艾滋病在蔓延　各国积极预防
    李家德
    艾滋病已经成为一种世界性的传染病，今年以来，更呈进一步蔓延之势。据世界卫生组织11月3日公布的统计数字，截至1989年10月底，在世界152个国家中共发现18.6万例艾滋病患者，实际上，目前全世界的艾滋病患者远不止这个数目，估计可能达60万之众。至于病毒携带者则更是为数众多，据不完全统计，当在600万至800万之间。如果按照目前的趋势发展下去，到本世纪末，艾滋病患者将达600万，病毒携带者高达1200万至2400万。
    更为严重的是，艾滋病对儿童生命的威胁比成人尤甚。据世界卫生组织征服艾滋病委员会最近在巴黎的一次记者招待会上宣布，法国每年有500多个受到艾滋病毒感染的新生儿，美国有15万，非洲则更多。将病毒传染给孩子的主要是他们的母亲。受感染的孩子的发病率达80％，大大超过成年人。目前，全世界带有艾滋病病毒的孕妇有200万左右。
    艾滋病在非洲、美洲、欧洲的一些国家为害正烈，其中，艾滋病患者最多的国家是美国，达10.7308万例，占全球患者总数的57％。据美国有关部门预计，到1991年底，美国艾滋病患者将达27万，其中17.9万人将因此而丧生。艾滋病的肆虐程度已经可以和14世纪中期席卷欧洲的
  “黑死病”相比拟，当时那场灾难使欧洲约1／3的人死亡。世界卫生组织秘书长曾忧心忡忡地说：“我们正赤裸裸地站在有史以来最严重的致命传染病面前……对于这一处境我们都估计不足。”
    一年来，科学家和专家们对治疗艾滋病的药物的研制有些新的进展，但仍处于试验阶段。
    大多数专家和学者们认为，遏制艾滋病进一步蔓延最有效的办法还是教育。据世界卫生组织的对付艾滋病全球计划的负责人说，目前世界上几乎每个国家都制定了如何防治艾滋病的教育计划，各国的教育形式多种多样，日益普及。
    美国政府为防止艾滋病的迅速蔓延，已着手向全国人民邮寄有关艾滋病传播和预防的知识手册。为印制、发行这份厚达8页的宣传手册，耗资约需1700万美元。
    现在，美国已有17个州授权学校进行艾滋病防治教育。美国卫生与公众服务部的疾病控制中心制定了如何在各类学校进行艾滋病防治教育的指导方针。康涅狄格州和佛罗里达州规定公立学校必须开设介绍艾滋病防治知识的课程。他们的宣传方式多种多样，有讲演、幻灯、电影，还有讨论，预防艾滋病的常识已基本上得到了普及。
    美国政府在今年还通过了一项防止艾滋病传播的法案。新法案计划，国家每年拨款4亿美元用于全民，特别是那些经常接触艾滋病毒的工作人员的检验和预防，用通俗易懂的语言进行性知识教育，并广泛发售避孕用品。
    法国是欧洲艾滋病患者最多的国家，据世界卫生组织最新统计的数字，患者人数已达7149。为在全国大张旗鼓地宣传预防艾滋病，法国政府已决定拨出1亿法郎，其中5500万法郎将用于广告宣传，并在卫生部设置一协调机构，协调政府各部门有关预防艾滋病的教育宣传工作。英国和西德已向全国散发了数以千万计的关于预防艾滋病知识的宣传品。西德的口号是“艾滋病与人人有关。”
    受艾滋病危害严重的巴西，到今年11月，患者已达9300名，患者总人数仅次于美国，居世界第二位。目前，巴西政府采取电影、电视、广播以及在公共场所张贴标语、海报等方式，宣传艾滋病的危害性和讨论预防方法。
    截至今年9月底，非洲大陆艾滋病患者已逾3.1万人。非统组织代理秘书长呼吁青年进行自我教育，大力宣传艾滋病的危害。
    艾滋病的蔓延不仅是一个科学问题，而且是一个社会问题。在很大程度上来说，它是一种由于生活方式而引起的疾病。因此，宣传教育对防止艾滋病的蔓延发挥了积极作用。据世界卫生组织调查，通过宣传和教育，人们的行为和习惯已有所变化，例如，“在挪威、丹麦、瑞士、阿姆斯特丹、伦敦、纽约和旧金山的寻欢作乐者之中，这种变化就很明显。”在肯尼亚的内罗毕、加纳的阿克拉等地，由于最近实行了预防艾滋病计划，人们已开始规范自己的性行为。美国、意大利和荷兰等西方国家中静脉注射毒品的现象也已有所变化。现在，越来越多的英国人趋向于更严格的道德观念和谴责同性恋行为；美国人的社交生活及道德风尚也正在发生变化，更多的人主张回到家庭的一夫一妻制；76％的法国公民愿意接受事先通知的艾滋病检查；意大利约50％的艾滋病病毒携带者孕妇，已采取人工流产措施，以避免生产不幸儿。
    人类同艾滋病这一恶魔的斗争将是长期的。令人欣慰的是，现在已经有越来越多的人开始认识到它的危害，并且行动起来加入预防艾滋病的斗争行列。
