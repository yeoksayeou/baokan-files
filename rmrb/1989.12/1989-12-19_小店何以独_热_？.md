Since the end of October, the two sales outlets of Daobei Department Store in Luoyang, Henan Province, have been bustling with customers and thriving in business. In just over 10 days, more than 2,000 Flying Pigeon and Spruce brand bicycles were sold out, setting a new record for the highest daily sales volume in Luoyang's stores. The store immediately contacted the Tianjin factory, requesting an additional 1,500 bicycles. In just one month, this small shop sold 4,000 bicycles!

The two brands of bicycles on sale this time, totaling 8 varieties, were all hot sellers. On the first day of the sale, customers crowded the two sales outlets, forming multiple layers of people. Those who paid had to queue up, and those who picked up their purchases also had to queue. On November 7th, despite heavy rain, many customers still braved the weather to buy bicycles, holding umbrellas as they rushed to purchase.

In a situation where the market in some places is sluggish, why did Tianjin bicycles sell so well in this small shop in Luoyang? The key lies in the efforts made by both the factory and the store to open up the market for these products.

Firstly, they worked together sincerely and coordinated their actions. Daobei Store is a small collective enterprise with only 47 employees, but it has a high commercial reputation and has been recognized as an advanced unit by the province, city, and district for many years. Tianjin Bicycle Factory No. 2 is a well-known large factory nationwide, but the factory humbly cooperated with the small Daobei Store, paying half of the transportation costs and adopting flexible settlement methods for the goods. Daobei Store, which was selling bicycles for the first time, promised to do its best to make this "battle" a success.

Secondly, the prices were reasonable. This time, the factory and the store worked together, trading directly without any intermediaries, making the prices about 25% lower than similar products in the Luoyang market.

Thirdly, the sales methods were flexible. Farmers could use their ID cards, urban residents could cut out the "Flying Pigeon" and "Spruce" logos from the advertisements in the "Luoyang Daily," and revolutionary martyrs' families, disabled soldiers, old revolutionaries, and model workers could use their relevant certificates to enjoy a 10-yuan discount when purchasing bicycles. The store also reimbursed the travel expenses for farmers from the suburbs who came to the city to buy bicycles.

Fourthly, the quality was reliable, and the service was meticulous. In addition to ensuring the quality of the bicycles, Tianjin Bicycle Factory No. 2 also packed and transported them safely to Luoyang. They also sent 6 business leaders and technical experts to the sales site to provide technical consultations and maintenance services.

Fifthly, the publicity was well done. During the sales period, the store used banners, newspaper advertisements, and other forms to create a buzz. They wrote catchy slogans such as "Buying now won't be a loss, save dozens of yuan," "Tianjin bikes are really beautiful, ideal for commuting and carrying," "Just a look, feel relaxed; just a buy, feel delighted; just a ride, really beautiful," which resonated with the customers.

The hot sale of bicycles made Daobei Department Store manager Gao Xiaoge feel deeply moved. He said that although the current market seems sluggish, it is actually stabilizing, with a trend of steady improvement. As long as the product quality is reliable, the price is reasonable, the service is meticulous, and the sales methods are flexible, it is possible to win the market and customers.

Tianjin Bicycle Factory No. 2 also gained great insights from the Luoyang sales event, realizing that there are tens of thousands of small shops like Daobei Store nationwide. Extending their reach to these enterprises is a good way to turn passive situations into active ones.

    小店何以独“热”？
    王建都　姬传东
    10月底以来，河南洛阳市道北百货商店两个展销处人头攒动，生意兴隆。仅10多天时间，2000多辆飞鸽牌和斯普瑞克牌自行车便被抢购一空，创洛阳市各商店日销售量最高纪录。
    商店急电天津厂家，要求增发1500辆。短短一个月，这个小店售出了4000辆！
    这次展销的两个牌号的自行车，共8个品种，全部热销。开展第一天，顾客就把两个展销处围得里三层外三层，交款排队，提货还得排队。11月7日，天下大雨，许多顾客仍手持雨伞争相购车。
    在当前一些地方市场销售不旺的情况下，天津自行车何以能在洛阳这家小店如此热销呢？关键是工商双方在着力开辟商品销售市场上下了功夫。
    其一，真诚合作，协调动作。道北商店是一家集体小企业，仅有职工47人，但商业信誉高，连年被省、市、区评为先进单位。天津自行车二厂是全国有名的大厂，但该厂主动放下架子，乐意与道北小店合作，并支付一半运费，在货款结算上也采取灵活形式。道北商店是第一次经销自行车，表示竭尽全力打好这次“战役”。
    其二，价格适中。这次展销，厂商挂钩，直线交易，不经任何中间环节，价格比洛阳市场同类产品低25％左右。
    其三，经销方式灵活，农民凭身份证，城市居民剪下  《洛阳日报》广告上刊登的“飞鸽”和“斯普瑞克”商标图案，烈军属、残废军人、老红军及英模凭有关证件，购车时均优惠10元。商店还给郊县进城购车的农民报销路费。
    其四，质量可靠，服务周到。天津自行车二厂除严把质量关外，还包装好，运输好，安安全全把车运到洛阳，并派出6名业务领导和技术骨干，在展销现场开展技术咨询、维修服务。
    其五，宣传搞得好。展销期间，商店利用横幅、报纸广告等形式，造声势，编写了“现在买车不吃亏，一辆便宜几十元”、“天津车子真漂亮，代步运载最理想”、“看一看，心情舒畅；买一辆，心花怒放；骑一骑，真是漂亮”等顺口溜，很对顾客心思。
    自行车的热销，使道北百货商店经理高晓歌感慨万千，他说，当前市场看似疲软，实则趋向稳定，稳中有升，稳中见旺，只要产品质量可靠，价格合理，服务周到，经销灵活，是可以赢得市场，赢得顾客的。
    天津自行车二厂也从洛阳展销中大受启发，认识到像道北商店这样的小店，全国数以万计，把触角伸向这些企业，是变被动为主动的一条好出路。
