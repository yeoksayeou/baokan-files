"Write about him, write about this young man who donated the crane painting," a responsible official from the Asian Games fundraising department said at a large donation ceremony, introducing the young painter Tan Tai Jingkai and his collaborators to the reporter for an interview.

A large crane painting was unveiled. Wow! It is 7 meters long and 1.6 meters wide, truly grand in scale. Standing in front of the painting is like being in the wild. Each crane, whether standing, flying, or calling, is vivid and lifelike. The brushwork is fresh, and the lines are exquisite, truly not often seen.

It is evident that the entire painting is infused with a lot of heart and wisdom, expressing deep affection for the Asian Games. To create this painting for the Asian Games, he spent months planning, reading a large amount of Asian Games materials and reports, being inspired by the crowds donating and fundraising, and observing the builders' heroic postures on the Asian Games construction sites. His emotions surged, inspiring him to create a large crane painting to praise the Asian people welcoming the grand event. Thus, he and his friends brought a pile of instant noodles into the studio. Day and night, they worked tirelessly on the painting. When hungry, they would eat a few bites of instant noodles, even squeezing out time to eat. After several dozen days of hard work, they finally completed the painting of the cranes. He smiled and said, "The cranes are flying towards the Asian Games."

The cranes took flight, and Tan Tai Jingkai's emotions surged. He felt proud to be able to contribute to the Asian Games. He was nurtured by the people and always thought about repaying them. Tan Tai Jingkai, due to his parents' early divorce, lost his family's warmth at a young age. However, the people around him all cared for and nurtured him. Famous painters taught him painting, martial artists taught him martial arts, and qigong masters taught him qigong. He drank deeply from the people's milk and absorbed wisdom from all sides, thus growing into a painter. This is what the people of the motherland have given him. He said, "The Asian Games bring honor to the country, and I add luster to the Asian Games. This slogan is great. As a child of the motherland, how can one not do one's best?" When he said this, his eyes were filled with tears, obviously thinking of his own growth journey. Yes, Tan Tai Jingkai always connects his fate with that of the motherland.

His deep affection for the Asian Games is also related to his love for martial arts. Tan Tai Jingkai began practicing martial arts at the age of 8, first learning boxing, then swordsmanship. He can perform more than ten kinds of boxing, with single saber, tiger fist, and ambush fist being his specialties. His movements are agile and practical. When he learned that this Asian Games included martial arts competitions, he felt even more connected to the Asian Games.

Art master Qi Baishi wrote in a poem, "The sea is the world of dragons, and the clouds are the home of cranes." Some say that Tan Tai Jingkai, who worked tirelessly to paint the crane painting for the Asian Games, has a deeper meaning. The cranes will lead this Asian Games child to distant places.

    飞向亚运的“仙鹤”
    ——记给亚运会捐画的青年画家澹台京开
      “写写他吧，写写这个献仙鹤画的青年。”亚运会集资部一位负责同志在大型捐赠仪式上，把青年画家澹台京开和他的合作者介绍给记者采访。
    一幅大型的仙鹤画展开了，呵！7米长，1米6宽，气魄真大，站在画前如置身于原野。只只仙鹤，有立、有飞、有鸣，千姿百态，栩栩如生。笔墨之新，用线之妙，确不多见。
    看得出，整幅画融进了不少心血和智慧，表达了对亚运会的深情。为了给亚运会作画，他构思了几个月，翻阅了大量的亚运会资料和报道，到群众集资捐赠的队伍中受感染，在亚运工地上看建设者的雄姿，让感情的波涛冲击思维的大门。突然产生灵感，要为亚运会画一幅大型的仙鹤图，颂扬亚洲人民迎盛会。于是他和朋友带着一大堆方便面进了画室，白天黑夜埋头绘画，饿了啃几口方便面，连吃饭的时间都挤出来。经过几十天的奋战，终于画出了群鹤，他笑着说：仙鹤飞向亚运会了。
    仙鹤起飞了，澹台京开的感情也奔腾起来，他为自己能给亚运会作贡献感到自豪。他是人民养育大的，时时想到报恩。澹台京开由于父母很早离异，从小就失去家庭温暖，但是周围的人们都关心培育他。名画家教他绘画，武术家叫他习武，气功师教他练功……他饱吮人民的乳汁，吸取各方的智慧，于是，使自己成长为一个画家。这是祖国人民给予他的。他说：“亚运为国争荣誉，我为亚运添光彩，这个口号太好了，作为祖国的儿女，哪有不尽心尽力的。”说这话时，他眼里含着热泪，显然又想到自己成长的历程。是的，澹台京开总是把自己的命运和祖国紧紧相连。
    他对亚运会感情深，还同其喜爱武术有关。澹台京开从8岁开始习武，先学拳，后学剑，能够演练十几种拳，其中单刀、虎拳和埋伏拳最拿手，起伏开合，高击低打，如猛虎下山，动作漂亮实用。当他得知本届亚运会增加武术比赛时，更把自己和亚运会紧紧连在一起。
    艺术大师齐白石在一首诗中写道：“海为龙世界，云是鹤家乡”。有人说，澹台京开废寝忘食地给亚运会画仙鹤图，还有更深的意思，仙鹤会把这位亚运赤子引向远方。
