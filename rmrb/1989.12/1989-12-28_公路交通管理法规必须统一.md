Highway traffic management is a comprehensive task that primarily includes four aspects: highway administration, management of toll collection and usage, highway transport administration, and highway traffic safety management. According to China's current management system, the first three aspects are managed by the transportation departments at various levels of government, while the last aspect is managed by the public security departments at various levels of government. The transportation and public security departments, based on their respective responsibilities, implement highway traffic management and must have their own management methods and tools. In essence, the 1986 reform of China's highway traffic management system was mainly a reform of the road traffic safety management system; the vehicle inspection work, which was originally managed by both the transportation and public security departments, was changed to be managed solely by the public security department. This means that highway (road) safety management is unified under the public security department, not that highway administration, toll collection and usage management, and highway transport administration are also unified under the public security department. It is obvious that road traffic safety management cannot be equated with highway (road) traffic management. The transportation department, like the public security department, is also a government management department. There is no issue of the transportation department only being responsible for transportation while the public security department is responsible for management. The transportation and public security departments should each perform their duties, take responsibility for their respective tasks, support each other, and cooperate to jointly manage road traffic and serve the development of China's highway traffic industry. However, due to conflicts and inconsistencies between some management regulations, disputes between the transportation and public security departments have frequently arisen.

It is well known that highways are not only the main workplaces for highway construction, maintenance, and transportation operations but also the main workplaces for transportation authorities to fulfill their supervisory and inspection duties under the "Highway Management Regulations." Just as those who manage buildings must enter the buildings to carry out their work, the transportation department can only perform its management functions by going on the road. If the transportation department does not have the authority to conduct road inspections and checks, it cannot perform its management duties, which is a fundamental principle. Therefore, the relevant provisions of the "Highway Management Regulations" are completely in line with the objective laws of management work. From the practice of implementing the "Highway Management Regulations" over the past two years, the governments of Gansu, Xinjiang, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, Jilin, and Shanxi provinces and autonomous regions have all clearly stipulated, based on the "Highway Management Regulations," that both the public security and transportation departments have the right to conduct road inspections and checks, and have allowed the transportation department to set up checkpoints as needed, with good implementation results. It is hoped that relevant departments will, as soon as possible, follow legal procedures to reasonably adjust and modify the conflicting clauses in the two regulations, unify the highway traffic management laws and regulations, and solve the problem of the current chaotic situation in China's highway traffic management.

    公路交通管理法规必须统一
    北京　郑实
    公路交通管理是一项综合管理，主要包括公路路政管理、公路规费征收使用管理、公路运政管理和公路交通安全管理四个方面。按照我国现行的管理体制，前三者的管理工作由各级政府交通部门负责，后者则由各级政府公安部门负责。交通、公安部门根据各自的职责，实施公路交通管理，也必须有各自的管理方法和管理手段。实质上，1986年我国道路交通管理体制的改革，主要是道路交通安全管理体制的改革；车辆监理工作由原来交通、公安两个部门分别管理改由公安部门统一管理，是指公路（道路）安全管理统一由公安部门管理，并不是公路路政管理、公路规费征收使用管理、公路运政管理也统一由公安部门负责。显而易见，道路交通安全管理决不能等同于公路（道路）交通管理。交通部门同公安部门一样，也是政府的管理部门之一，这里根本不存在交通部门只管运输，公安部门才负责管理的问题。交通、公安两个部门应当各司其职，各负其责，互相支持，互相配合，共同搞好道路交通管理，为发展我国公路交通事业服务。然而，由于有关的一些管理条例之间存在矛盾，不统一，交通、公安两个部门纠纷迭起。
    众所周知，公路既是公路建设养护、公路运输经营的主要工作场所，也是交通主管部门履行对《公路管理条例》实施监督检查职责的主要工作场所。如同管房屋的人要进入房屋才能开展工作一样，交通部门只有上路才能行使管理职能。如果交通部门没有路检路查权，就无法进行管理，这是天经地义的道理。因此，《公路管理条例》的有关这些规定是完全符合管理工作客观规律要求的。从《公路管理条例》颁布实施两年来的实践看，甘肃、新疆、山东、河北、江西、吉林、山西等省、自治区人民政府，依据《公路管理条例》，都明确规定了公安、交通部门均有权实施路检路查，准予交通部门根据需要单独设立检查站卡，执行情况较好。希望有关部门尽快按照法律程序，对两个《条例》的矛盾条款作出合理的调整、修改，使公路交通管理法令统一，是解决我国目前公路交通管理混乱状况的首要问题。
