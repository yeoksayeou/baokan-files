Some countries have responded differently to the U.S. invasion of Panama.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, some European countries have reacted differently to the U.S. invasion of Panama.

Bulgarian Foreign Minister Bozhidar Dimitrov said at a press conference on the 21st that the U.S. military action violates international law and is contrary to the United Nations Charter.

An article in the Polish United Workers' Party's official newspaper, *People's Tribune*, published on the 21st stated, "The U.S. government has always claimed to be a critic of Brezhnev's limited sovereignty doctrine, but today it is also a practitioner of this theory."

Finnish Foreign Minister Pertti Paasio stated in a declaration that the Finnish government regrets the escalation of the situation in Panama.

The French Foreign Ministry's communiqué said that the French government believes that "the use of force at any time is regrettable."

The West German government's deputy spokesman, Vogel, issued a statement saying that the West German government hopes the military conflict in Panama will end as soon as possible.

The foreign affairs spokesman for Britain's Labour Party stated that the U.S. military intervention is "unjustified and only shows that the U.S. is trying to protect its interests in the Panama Canal." The spokesman for British Prime Minister Thatcher, however, announced that Britain "fully supports the U.S. military action in Panama."
