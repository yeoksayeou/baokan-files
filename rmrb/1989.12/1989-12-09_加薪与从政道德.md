The U.S. Congress passed a so-called "Political Ethics Reform Bill" on the evening of December 17 and submitted it to President Bush for signature. The bill, which went from initial review by both the House and Senate to final passage in just two days, was unusually swift by congressional legislative standards.

The bill, ostensibly aimed at political ethics reform, actually serves to significantly raise the salaries of congressmen and high-ranking government officials. The bill stipulates that by October 1991, the annual salary of 435 representatives will increase from the current $89,500 to approximately $125,000. The salaries of high-ranking government officials, including the Vice President, and federal judges will also increase by 40% during the same period. Additionally, the bill prohibits representatives and other beneficiaries from keeping lecture fees for themselves, requiring them to donate all such earnings to charitable causes. It also imposes certain restrictions on their additional income, gifts, and travel expenses.

The provisions for the 100 senators are different. By October 1991, senators' annual salaries will increase from the current $89,500 to $98,400. Local commentators note that this is a consideration for next year's midterm elections, and future salary increases are inevitable. On the surface, the salary increase for senators is less than that for representatives, but senators' total income will be higher because the bill allows them to accept lecture fees, up to $26,568 per year, and places no restrictions on other additional income.

During the congressional review process, there were differing opinions within Congress, but those in favor of the salary increase were clearly in the majority. In the past, leaders of both parties have often argued and attacked each other on most legislative issues, sometimes to the point of red-faced confrontations. This time, however, they unusually maintained a united front and cooperated closely. They even wrote a joint letter, vowing not to use the salary increase issue to attack each other during next year's midterm elections. Despite this, a Democratic congressman still criticized, saying that those who supported the bill were essentially "pointing a gun at the heads of American taxpayers, saying, 'Give me a raise, or I'll accept bribes from special interest groups.'" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee immediately refuted this, hinting that they would refuse to provide him with financial support during next year's elections.

The American media and public also have reservations about this bill. A representative of a civic organization criticized the bill as "immoral" and "hypocritical," noting that while Congress and the White House are cutting civilian expenditures under the constraints of the budget balancing law, they are significantly increasing their own salaries. Others criticized that the bill contrasts sharply with the minimum wage increase bill. The former was passed in two days with an increase of $18 per hour, while the latter took several months and faced numerous obstacles, nearly failing, with an increase of only 90 cents per hour.

Moreover, despite the annual rise in inflation, the minimum wage has remained at $3.35 per hour since 1981, without a single cent increase.

The Political Ethics Reform Bill has been sent to the Oval Office, and President Bush will sign it into law. However, before the Thanksgiving holiday, Congress still faces another urgent agenda item: passing a bill to reduce the 1990 budget deficit by $140 billion. Since President Bush opposes tax increases, Congress can only focus on cutting expenditures. The question remains: how will congressmen explain to voters the contradiction between their own significant salary increases and further cuts to civilian expenditures?

### 加薪与从政道德

    加薪与从政道德
    本报记者　张亮
    美国国会十七日晚通过一项所谓“从政道德改革法案”，并随即提交布什总统签署。该法案从众参两院开始审议到最后获得通过仅用了两天时间，速度之快在美国会立法史上还不曾多见。
    原来，这项法案名曰从政道德改革，实质上是为议员们及政府高级官员大幅度增加薪水。法案规定，到一九九一年十月四百三十五名众议员的年薪将从目前的八点九五万美元加码到大约十二点五万美元，包括副总统在内的政府高级官员和联邦法官的年薪同期内也将上调百分之四十。另一方面，它还规定不准众议员和其他加薪人员将演讲所得装进自己的腰包，而必须全部捐赠给慈善事业，对他们的额外收入，接收礼品和旅行费用等亦作了某些限制。
    而对一百名参议员的规定则有所不同。到一九九一年十月，参议员的年薪将由现在的八点九五万美元提高到九点八四万美元。据此间舆论评论说，这是出于明年中期选举的考虑，日后必然将再度加薪。从表面上看，参议员的加薪幅度不及众议员，但参议员的总收入将高于众议员，因为法案允许参议员接收演讲费，最高可达每年二万六千五百六十八美元，而且对其它额外收入也无限制。
    在国会审议过程中，国会内部虽有不同意见，但赞成加薪者明显占上风。以往，两党领导人在大多数立法问题上总是争吵不休，甚至常常相互攻击，闹得面红耳赤。而这一次则异乎寻常地步调一致，合作得非常密切。他们还联名写信，发誓在明年中期选举时不利用加薪问题攻击对方。尽管如此，一位民主党议员还是批评说，赞成该法案的议员们等于“把枪口对准美国纳税人的脑袋说，给我加薪，否则我就接受特殊利益集团的贿赂。”民主党国会竞选委员会马上出来驳斥，并暗示明年选举时拒绝给他财政支持。
    美国舆论界和公众对此法案也有非议。一家民间组织的负责人指责该法案是“不道德”和“伪善”的，因为一方面国会和白宫在平衡预算法的制约下大砍民用开支，而另一方面则为自己大幅度提薪。有人还批评说，该法案与提高最低工资法案形成鲜明对照。前者用了两天时间就得以通过，增加幅度高达每小时十八美元，而后者则花了长达几个月的时间，而且颇费周折，险些告吹，其增加幅度也仅为每小时九十美分。
    另外，尽管通货膨胀率连年上升，但最低工资自一九八一年以来一直为每小时三点三五美元，分文未加。
    从政道德改革法案已送达白宫椭圆形办公室，布什总统将签署，使之成为法律。然而，在感恩节休假之前，国会还面临另外一项紧迫议程，即通过一项将一九九○年度预算赤字削减一百四十亿美元的法案。由于布什总统反对增税而无法开源，国会只能在节流上作文章。问题是，议员们将如何向选民们解释为自己大幅度加薪与进一步削砍民用开支这一矛盾呢？
