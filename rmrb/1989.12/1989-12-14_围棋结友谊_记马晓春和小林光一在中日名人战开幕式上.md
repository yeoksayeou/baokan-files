In the history of Sino-Japanese exchanges, Go is friendship, and the game is a meeting of friends. The top players from both countries undoubtedly have a deeper understanding of this.

On the evening of December 13th, at the opening ceremony of the second China-Japan Go Name Match, Ma Xiaochun and Kobayashi Koichi walked side by side to the front of the stage. They exchanged smiles and, without a word, extended their hands to each other, shaking firmly. Immediately, the entire audience erupted in applause. After a moment of polite refusal, the Japanese title holder, Kobayashi Koichi, spoke: "This is my sixth time in China, but this time my feelings are different from before. Previously, I came to participate in team matches, but now I am facing a single duel with my talented friend. I have been looking forward to this opportunity for a long time, so I will strive to fully demonstrate my level and not disappoint the expectations of the Go communities in both countries." Accompanying Japanese Go officials told reporters that these were Kobayashi's true feelings. At the beginning of last month, after successfully defending his title, he announced to the media that the Name Match had not yet ended, because his true opponent was in China, Ma Xiaochun. For a month, he has prepared extensively for this. Ma Xiaochun, holding the microphone, still spoke in his soft Zhejiang accent, "Having the opportunity to play against Kobayashi Name Holder is the happiest thing for me. He is the strongest player in Japan and one of the strongest in the world today. I believe that through this match, I will learn a lot. For this, I first want to strive for a draw in the first two games with Kobayashi Name Holder, so that everyone can see our third game." Although victory and defeat are common, in the past three China-Japan top-level matches, the Chinese players have not won a single game, which is somewhat regrettable. As Ma Xiaochun put it, his goal this time is to add luster to the China-Japan Go Name Match. His words of ambition once again stirred the audience to applause. After listening, Kobayashi Koichi extended his hand to Ma Xiaochun again, and the two title holders' hands were tightly clasped once more.

    围棋结友谊
    ——记马晓春和小林光一在中日名人战开幕式上
    在中日交往史上，围棋即友谊，对弈如会友，两国弈林高手显然对此体会更为深切。
    13日晚，第二届中日围棋名人战开幕式上，马晓春和小林光一并肩走到主席台前，两人相顾一笑，未曾开口先向对方伸出手，紧紧相握，顿时，全场爆满掌声。一番推让后，日本当届名人小林光一开口道：“我已是第六次来中国，但这一回心情不同以往，以前都是来参加团体赛，现在却是与天才棋友单打独斗。这个机会我盼望已久，所以，我要力争充分发挥自己的水平，以不辜负两国棋界的期望。”随行来华的日本棋界人士向记者介绍说，这是小林君的心里话。他上月初一蝉联名人称号，便向报界宣布，名人战尚未结束，因为他真正的对手在中国，是马晓春。一个月来，他为此作了大量准备。马晓春握着话筒，依然是淡淡的浙南乡音，“有机会和小林名人对弈，是我最高兴的事，他是日本、也是当今世界最强的棋手之一，相信通过这次比赛，我定能学到许多东西。为此，我首先要争取在前两局和小林名人打成平手，使大家能看到我们的第三盘对弈。”虽说，胜负寻常事，但在过去3次中日冠军级比赛中，中方棋手未胜一局，毕竟有些令人遗憾。用马晓春的话来说，他这次的目标是使中日围棋名人战锦上添花。他这番雄心勃然的话，再次激起满场掌声。小林光一听罢，又一次向马晓春伸出手去，两位名人的手再次紧紧相握。
