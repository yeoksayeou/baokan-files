River South Province Linying County Party Committee leaders have changed their work style, breaking away from the burden of paperwork and meetings, conducting in-depth investigations and studies at the grassroots level, seeking effective strategies from the people, and solving practical problems with a pragmatic spirit. This has promoted the rectification and deepened rural reforms.

Since August this year, the County Committee's standing committee members have seriously studied the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Based on a summary and analysis of the county's rectification and rural reform, they have formulated and improved strict management systems for leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots and among the people. Since August, 9 standing committee members have gone to the grassroots for investigations and participated in labor, collecting opinions from the people. County Committee Acting Secretary Tian Chengzhong, in order to implement the spirit of the Thirteenth Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session in rural areas, led relevant county committee cadres to go deep into 8 townships. He focused on the issues of cadres borrowing and misappropriating public funds and using power for personal gain, which were strongly reflected by the people. He organized a special team to conduct investigations and clean-up, recovering a total of 2.12 million yuan in borrowed and misappropriated public funds across the county, and detaining 8 people according to law. To further improve the rectification, County Committee Deputy Secretary Chen Liushen, together with leaders from the Finance Commission, Price Bureau, Industry and Commerce, and Finance departments, studied the slow progress of the county's project compression and reconstruction and the cleanup and rectification of companies. They identified the root causes and took decisive measures, shutting down 17 companies and delaying the reconstruction of 5 projects.
