The Private Garden of Yangzhou is renowned for its distinctive character.

The four-season rockery of the Private Garden, with the Yiyu Pavilion as its center, starts from the south side of the Yiyu Pavilion and proceeds in a clockwise direction. As you walk around, the scenery of spring, summer, autumn, and winter unfolds before your eyes. To the south of the Yiyu Pavilion, in front of the stone gate of the Private Garden, is a vibrant spring landscape. Amidst a forest of green bamboo, white fruit peak stones of varying heights and thicknesses are scattered, like spring sprouts emerging from the ground after rain. Proceeding into the garden and slowly making your way to the northwest of the Yiyu Pavilion, you can experience the transition from spring to summer. A summer rockery made of Taihu stones comes into view, delicate and transparent, standing by the water, blending harmoniously with the lotus leaves in the pond, adding a touch of summer heat. With the phoenix trees providing shade and dense shadows covering the ground, and several clumps of bananas standing tall in front of the rockery, one feels a gentle breeze. From here, you enter the autumn rockery, which seems naturally formed. The autumn rockery is made of yellow stones, steep and towering, with a majestic presence. The yellow stones and red maple leaves, bathed in the setting sun, create a golden hue, with a high sky and thin clouds, enhancing the autumn scenery. The autumn rockery extends to the northeast of the Yiyu Pavilion, leaving little space for the winter rockery, making one think of the philosophical poem, "Winter has arrived, but spring is not far away." The winter rockery is made of Xuan stones, with surfaces resembling accumulated snow, and ice-crack patterns on the ground, truly immersing one in a world of ice and snow. Additionally, twenty-four wind holes are specially carved on the south wall of the rockery, enhancing the auditory effect of the wind, adding a sense of "howling north winds and cold snow light." At the end of the winter rockery, just beyond a wall, is the spring rockery. Looking through the peephole in the wall, spring is already beckoning to us!

Gardens with rockeries are common, but none are as uniquely laid out as the Private Garden. The four-season rockery of the Private Garden is summed up by previous generations in four lines: "Spring mountains are soft and smiling, summer mountains are lush and dripping, autumn mountains are clear and adorned, winter mountains are bleak and sleeping." The rockery of the Private Garden partially uses Huangshan stones, with winding paths within the mountains leading to the top, which is the northern style of stonework. Partially, Taihu stones are used for inlay, with flowing springs and reflections, winding around a corner, which is the southern style of stonework. This signifies that the southern and northern schools of landscape painting are harmoniously unified within a garden of less than fifty acres.

    扬州个园
    王向东
    扬州个园，以它鲜明的个性名闻遐迩。
    个园的四季假山，以宜雨轩为中心，由宜雨轩南面开始，顺时针方向转上一圈，春夏秋冬四季景色便依次进入眼帘。在宜雨轩正南面个园的石额门前，是一派春意盎然的春山。万竿翠竹之中，高低粗细错落有致的白果峰石点缀其间，恰如雨后春笋一般破土而出。由此进园，慢慢向宜雨轩西北面走去，便可领略由春入夏的滋味，只见一座夏山扑面而来。夏山用太湖石叠成，玲珑剔透，临水而成，与池中的荷叶相映成趣，宛然添几份夏季的炎热。加上山侧梧桐蔽日，浓阴满地，山前芭蕉数丛，亭亭玉立，置身其间大有凉风习习之感。由此而入秋山，浑如天成。秋山以黄石叠成，峻峭凌云，气势磅礴。黄石丹枫，夕照涂金，天高云淡，备增秋色。秋山一直叠到宜雨轩东北面，使冬山占的地方很小，使人想到“冬天来了，春天还会远吗？”这句哲理诗。冬山用宣石叠成，石面恰如积雪，地面石块上的冰裂纹，真使人进入了一个冰天雪地的世界。加上假山南墙上特意开凿的二十四个风洞，增加了风声的音响效果，更有“北风呼啸雪光寒”的韵味。到冬山尽头，一墙之外便是春山，从隔墙上的漏窗抬眼望去，春天已经在那里向我们招手呢！
    园林假山处处有，不如个园布局奇。个园的四季假山，前人概括成这样四句话：“春山淡冶而如笑，夏山苍翠而如滴，秋山明净而如妆，冬山惨淡而如睡”。个园假山一部分采用黄山石堆叠，山腹中有曲折磴道而盘旋到顶，这是北派的石法；一部分运用太湖石镶嵌，流泉倒影，逶迤一角，这是南派的石法。这意味着山水画的南北二宗，和谐地统一在一个面积不足五十亩的园林里。
