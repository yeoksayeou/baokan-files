The Leping Colored Metal Mine in the Leping area of Chenzhou, Hunan Province, is facing severe destruction due to unregulated mining. On the hillside in front of the Leping Colored Metal Mine's processing plant, within a 0.25 square kilometer mining area, there are holes dug one next to another, washing and sorting shaker tables connected in a row, arsenic furnaces lined up, and makeshift shacks densely packed together. Statistics show that there are 42 unregulated mining points, 139 shaker tables, 94 arsenic furnaces, and 536 makeshift shacks. The sounds of explosions, noise, and machinery are constant; feces and urine are everywhere, creating a foul smell; arsenic smoke is pungent, causing severe environmental pollution; the vegetation on the mountain is withering, and the ground is barren.

The Leping Mine is rich in copper, tin, zinc, arsenic, and other colored and non-colored metals. Since 1985, people from Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and local villagers have flocked to the mining area, digging holes, and burning arsenic, turning a once thriving mine into a mess of holes, severely damaging the country's resources.

At the same time, the electricity and water supply of the Leping Colored Metal Mine have been stolen and intercepted. The high-voltage power lines set up by the Leping Colored Metal Mine to the processing plant and mine shafts have been illegally connected with numerous wires, resulting in the mine having to subsidize electricity costs amounting to 1.8 million yuan annually. The water flow from the mine to the processing plant has been intercepted by individual miners, who have diverted two-thirds of the water flow. The shaker tables of individual miners operate non-stop, while the Leping Colored Metal Mine's processing plant frequently stops production due to the theft and interception of electricity and water. The tailings dam of the processing plant has also been eroded, and some individual miners have set up shaker tables on the dam. The unregulated miners have also dumped waste rocks randomly in the main production base of the Leping Colored Metal Mine, located in the valley, and in the upper part of the severely landslide-prone Dazhi area, causing frequent landslides. On May 9 of this year, a flood occurred, and the large amount of waste rocks and tailings discarded in the landslide-prone area were washed down by the floodwater into the Dazhi area's fourth section, causing this section to remain out of production to this day.

    雷坪有色金属矿将毁于滥采乱挖
    湖南省郴州地区雷坪有色金属矿被滥采乱挖的情况十分严重。在山腰雷坪有色金属矿选厂前面0.25平方公里的矿区内，只见窿洞一个挨着一个，洗选摇床一台连着一台，砒灰炉子一座接着一座，简易工棚黑压压地连成一片。据统计，滥采乱挖打洞采矿点42个，摇床139台，砒灰炉94座，简易工棚536个。打炮声、喧闹声、机器声此起彼落；屎尿到处都是，臭气难闻；砒烟刺鼻，环境污染严重；山上草木枯萎，平地寸草不生。
    雷坪矿山盛产铜、锡、锌、砒等有色金属矿和非金属矿。自1985年以来，广西、浙江、江西、福建等省及本省村民纷纷涌入矿区，打门山，开窿洞、烧砒灰，把一个好端端的矿山糟踏得百孔千疮，国家资源受到严重破坏。
    同时，雷坪有色矿的电和水也遭到抢、截。雷坪有色矿架设的通往选矿厂和矿井的高压线，被滥采乱挖者强行接上一条一条电线，每年由矿里补贴的电费达18万元之多。从井下抽出送选矿厂选矿的水流被个体洗选者插入一根一根管道，截去水流的2／3。个体洗选者的摇床一天到晚不停地摇动着，可雷坪有色矿的选矿厂却经常由于电力和水流被抢、截而停产。选矿厂的尾矿坝也被侵蚀，有些个体采矿人员还在尾矿坝上盖棚设置摇床。滥采乱挖人员还将废石随意倾倒于雷坪有色矿矿区位于谷底的主要生产基地，大治工区上部严重滑坡地段，造成经常滑坡。今年5月9日，山洪暴发，被丢弃在滑坡地段的大量废石、尾砂，随着洪水直泻大治工区四中段，致使这个地段至今没有恢复生产。
