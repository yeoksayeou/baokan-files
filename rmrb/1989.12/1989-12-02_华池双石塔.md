From Huachi County in Gansu Province, traveling east for thirty kilometers, one arrives at the village of Wangtai in Baozichuan. Looking up, one can see the Double Stone Pagodas piercing the clouds like swords.

The Double Stone Pagodas stand side by side, eight meters apart, and rise about twelve meters high. Both pagodas are multi-faceted cones, divided into several layers, with each layer becoming smaller as they ascend. The connections between the layers have eaves, which are octagonal in shape and adorned with cloud patterns. Above the eaves, there are carved lotus bowls, placing each layer of the pagoda within a lotus bowl. The eastern pagoda, designated as No. 1, has an eight-sided first layer, with each side measuring forty centimeters in width. The second layer and the ten layers above it are all ten-sided. The western pagoda, designated as No. 2, has a similar structure to No. 1 but its top is damaged.

These pagodas were built during the Song Dynasty. The pagoda bodies are constructed from stone slabs and plates, joined together and polished smooth with red sandstone. There are over four thousand Buddha statues densely covering the pagodas from top to bottom, each with distinct expressions and lifelike details. Just the first layer of No. 1 has over four hundred statues. These statues are grouped in various formations, arranged according to Buddhist scriptures. On one side of the first layer of No. 1, above a seated Buddha, there are two flying celestial beings, floating as if in a dream. The second layer features the Nirvana of Sakyamuni, surrounded by weeping and kneeling small Buddhas. The first three layers of No. 2 are adorned with small Buddha statues, preaching images, and monks. The fourth layer has a niche on one side, with a Buddha and two disciples standing within. This stone carving is unique in Gansu and rare in the entire country.

    华池双石塔
    任真
    从甘肃的华池县往东三十公里，便到了豹子川王台村，抬头可见双石塔在目光中剑一般刺向云端。
    双石塔以并列状相隔八米之距拔地而起，约有十二米高。两塔均为多面锥体，分若干层，越往上越小。各层相连处还有塔檐，呈八角形状，上有云纹。塔檐上再刻一莲花盆，使各层塔身均置莲花盆中。东面为一号塔，第一层为八面体，每面宽四十厘米，第二层以上共十层，均为十面体。西面为二号塔，造形与一号塔相同，只是塔顶已损。
    此塔建于宋代，塔体由石条、石板合铆砌就，并用红岩石琢磨光滑。上有四千多尊佛像，密布塔身上下，神态各异，栩栩如生，仅一号塔第一层就有四百多尊。这些雕像均分若干群落，按佛经故事编排。一号塔第一层其中一面的一个坐佛上端还有两尊飞天，飘飘然如仙；第二层雕有释迦牟尼涅槃像，掩面哭泣、双膝下跪的众小佛布于周围。二号塔一二三层均为小佛像、说法图、比丘，第四层有一面开龛，一佛两弟子立于其中。这种石质雕作，在甘肃仅此一处，在全国亦属罕见。
