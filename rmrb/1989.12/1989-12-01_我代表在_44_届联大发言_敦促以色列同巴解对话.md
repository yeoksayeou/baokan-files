People's Daily, United Nations, November 29th. Reporter Liu Kai Cheng reports: China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Li Luye, spoke today at the 44th UN General Assembly session on the Palestinian issue. He urged Israel to recognize the State of Palestine as soon as possible and to engage in dialogue with the PLO. He called on the "Israeli government to face reality, follow the trend of the times, change its rigid stance, and act in the interests of the people of all Middle Eastern countries, including the Israeli people. Adopt a positive and flexible attitude to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem as soon as possible, so that the people of all Middle Eastern countries can enjoy peace and tranquility."

According to the Palestinian observer mission to the United Nations, to date, 104 countries around the world have recognized the State of Palestine, and the PLO has established ambassador-level diplomatic missions in the capitals of 85 countries. However, Israel insists on a stubborn position, refusing to acknowledge the right of the Palestinian people to establish a state and refusing to engage in dialogue with the PLO.

Li Luye emphasized that the Chinese government and people are highly concerned about the developments in the Middle East and have consistently supported the just cause of the Palestinian people. They support the efforts of the PLO and Arab countries to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue. Li Luye also reiterated China's support for an international conference on the Middle East issue under the auspices of the United Nations, including the five permanent members of the Security Council and other relevant parties; support for dialogue in various forms deemed appropriate by the relevant parties; demand that Israel stop suppressing the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, withdraw from the occupied Arab lands, and acknowledge the national rights of the Palestinian people; hope that the State of Palestine and the State of Israel will recognize each other, and that the Arab and Jewish peoples will live in peace.

Li Luye finally called on the international community to pay more attention to the Middle East issue and expressed that China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is willing to work with the relevant parties in the Middle East and all peace-loving and justice-seeking countries in the world to contribute to the realization of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.

    我代表在44届联大发言
    敦促以色列同巴解对话
    本报联合国11月29日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野大使今天在第44届联大审议巴勒斯坦问题时发言，敦促以色列尽早承认巴勒斯坦国，并与巴解组织对话。他呼吁“以色列政府正视现实，顺应时代潮流，改变僵硬立场，从包括以色列人民在内的中东各国人民的利益出发，采取积极、灵活态度，以早日实现中东问题公正、全面的解决，使中东各国人民共享和平与安宁”。
    据巴勒斯坦驻联合国观察员代表团说，迄今为止，世界上已有104个国家承认了巴勒斯坦国，巴解组织已在85个国家的首都设立了大使级外交机构。但以色列坚持顽固立场，至今不承认巴勒斯坦人民建立国家的权力，并拒绝与巴解组织进行对话。
    李鹿野强调中国政府和人民十分关注中东形势的发展，一贯支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义事业，支持巴解组织和阿拉伯各国为和平解决中东问题所做的不懈的努力。李鹿野还重申中国支持在联合国主持下召开包括安理会五个常任理事国在内的有关各方参加的中东问题国际会议；支持有关各方进行他们认为合适的各种形式的对话；要求以色列停止在占领区对巴勒斯坦人民的镇压，撤出占领的阿拉伯领土，承认巴勒斯坦人民的民族权利；希望巴勒斯坦国和以色列国相互承认，阿拉伯民族和犹太民族和平共处。
    李鹿野最后呼吁国际社会对中东问题给予更多的关注，并表示中国作为安理会常任理事国，愿同中东有关各方和世界上所有爱好和平及主持正义的国家一起，为实现中东公正、持久的和平作出自己的贡献。
