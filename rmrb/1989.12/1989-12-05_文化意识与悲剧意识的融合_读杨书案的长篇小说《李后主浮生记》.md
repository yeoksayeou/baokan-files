Yang Shuke is a very diligent writer. Over the past decade, he has produced a wealth of historical novels. Following his descriptions of the tragic and heroic journey of the peasant rebel leader Huang Chao in the late Tang Dynasty in the epic-like works *September Chrysanthemums* and *Sorrow of Chang'an*, he has also published the historical novels *Qin E Remembers*, *Half Red, Half Green* (also known as *An Anecdote of Emperor Yang of Sui*), *The Romantic Empress Wu*, and *The Life of Li Houzhu* (also known as *Once Did I Know War*). Another historical novel, *Confucius*, is also completed.

Looking back at Yang Shuke’s decade-long journey of writing historical novels, one can roughly see that he has shifted from having a strong epic consciousness to diminishing this consciousness, and instead, more consciously emphasizes cultural consciousness in his works. He aims to explore new paths in historical novel writing, showcasing the five-thousand-year-long, splendid cultural traditions and spiritual civilization of our Chinese nation. The cultural consciousness in Yang Shuke’s historical novels can be seen in his epic-like works such as *September Chrysanthemums*, *Sorrow of Chang'an*, and *Qin E Remembers*. However, this conscious pursuit and emphasis on cultural consciousness began with *Half Red, Half Green*, and in the recently published *The Life of Li Houzhu* by Beijing October Literature Publishing House, this cultural consciousness is further manifested in a brilliant cultural hue.

Li Houzhu of the Southern Tang Dynasty was not only a refined and elegant emperor but also a famous poet. Although his reign declined, many of his immortal poems have been passed down through the ages. Yang Shuke writes about Li Houzhu’s life of rise and fall, about his tragic life, which is different from writing the historical tragedies of Huang Chao, Qin Shi Huang, and others. He does not place Li Houzhu in the context of a turbulent society with sharp class contradictions to observe and reflect the social and historical significance of this tragedy. Instead, he downplays the social and historical background of Li Houzhu’s era, focusing more on Li Houzhu as a poet. He delves deeply into Li Houzhu from a cultural psychological perspective, successfully blending tragic consciousness with cultural consciousness. This allows us to see not only the historical tragedy of a once-ruling emperor of the Southern Tang Dynasty, who later became a captive of the Song Dynasty, but also, and more importantly, the cultural tragedy of a talented and kind-hearted poet. Because Yang Shuke chose to delve deeply into the cultural psychology in his creation, aiming to blend tragic consciousness with cultural consciousness from a new angle, this work naturally presents a new artistic style.

Firstly, in terms of structure, he briefly describes the war between the Southern Tang and the Song Dynasty until the fall of Jiankang City, where Li Houzhu and several hundred concubines and former officials were captured and taken to Bianliang (Kaifeng). This part is briefly written, accounting for about one-third of the entire book. However, when Li Houzhu and others were captured and taken to Bianliang, living in humiliation as captives, until they were poisoned to death by Zhao Guangyi, the author elaborates on this part. The author arranges it this way to fully display Li Houzhu’s tragic character. Although Li Houzhu fell from a noble emperor to a captive, he still enjoyed relatively rich living conditions. However, even his title “Disobedient Marquis” was humiliating, not to mention the strict surveillance, the prohibition of communication with former Southern Tang officials, and the summoning of his wives to accompany him in all-night banquets. It was under these circumstances that Li Houzhu further tasted the bitterness of being a prisoner and further stimulated his creative passion. Most of his famous poems, which are still popular today, were created during the short few years he was captured and lived in the Guest House for Scholars in Bianjing. He often suffered humiliation, and due to his weak character, he dared not resist, thus his indignation often turned into moving poems. Yang Shuke almost wrote about the origin of each of Li Houzhu’s famous poems and quoted these poems. These origins and poems constitute a very charming cultural hue. However, the author did not stop there. Instead, he further delved into Li Houzhu’s cultural psychology and tragic character through these poems, revealing Li Houzhu’s “outsider in officialdom, insider in poetry,” a poet who, due to historical mistakes, became the misguided emperor of the Southern Tang Dynasty, ultimately living a luxurious yet humiliating life as a captive. This is one aspect of delving into Li Houzhu’s cultural psychology and tragic character.

Secondly, we can also see from the work that the author wrote about Li Houzhu’s various love experiences and tragic endings. On one hand, this shows his romantic and emotional nature, and on the other hand, it further delves into his cultural psychology and tragic character from another angle. Take, for example, his love tragedy with Yumian. Yumian was originally a beautiful and lovely lotus girl from the south. At the age of sixteen, she was selected to perform the lotus dance at a local festival and was chosen by the Southern Tang beauty contest official to be sent to the palace, becoming Li Houzhu’s lotus consort. She did not enter the palace out of greed for the palace’s wealth and honor but was inspired by the beauty contest official’s singing of Li Houzhu’s poem and his praise of Li Houzhu’s “kindness and talent.” In the palace, Li Houzhu spent a large sum of money to cast a golden lotus for her and, based on the lotus dance performed by Pan Fei in the Southern Dynasty’s imperial court, co-created a new and unique “golden lotus dance” with her. It can be said that it was in this joint artistic creation that Li Houzhu and Yumian fell in love. Their relationship was not a general imperial and concubine relationship. Because of this, when Yumian was captured and taken to Bianjing with Li Houzhu, she practiced the golden lotus dance in the Guest House for Scholars to dispel Li Houzhu’s sadness. However, when Zhao Guangyi brought the golden lotus from the Southern Tang palace in Jiankang and forced Yumian to perform the golden lotus dance in public at the lotus festival, Yumian resolutely jumped from the golden lotus seat into the lotus pond, sacrificing herself. Yang Shuke used ten chapters (one-third of the entire book) to write about this love tragedy, showing his meticulous effort. On one hand, he further delved into Li Houzhu’s tragic character and cultural psychology through this story. On the other hand, he unintentionally wrote a chapter of Chinese dance history. Of course, this moving story is soaked in the blood and tears of Yumian, the dancer who pioneered Chinese ballet, and also reflects Yumian’s moving image, thus emitting a more profound cultural hue.

    文化意识与悲剧意识的融合
    ——读杨书案的长篇小说《李后主浮生记》
    何镇邦
    杨书案是位颇为勤奋的作家。十余年来，他在历史小说创作中果实累累。继描写唐末农民起义领袖黄巢整个悲壮历程的颇有史诗气度的《九月菊》、《长安恨》后，又有《秦娥忆》、《半江瑟瑟半江红》（又名《隋炀帝逸事》）、《风流武媚娘》、《李后主浮生记》（又名《几曾识干戈》）等长篇历史小说问世。另一部长篇历史小说《孔子》亦已杀青。
    回顾杨书案十余年来长篇历史小说创作历程，大致可以看出，他从具有较强的史诗意识正转而淡化史诗意识，而比较自觉地在创作中强化文化意识，力图在历史小说创作中另辟蹊径，表现我华夏五千年悠久而璀璨的文化传统和精神文明。杨书案历史小说创作中的文化意识在《九月菊》、《长安恨》和《秦娥忆》等具有史诗气度的作品中已闪烁可见。但是，这种文化意识的自觉追求和强化乃自《半江瑟瑟半江红》始，而到了新近由北京十月文艺出版社出版的《李后主浮生记》则进一步化为灿然的文化色彩。
    南唐后主李煜，既是一个风流儒雅的帝王，又是一位著名的词人，他虽然帝业颓倾，但是留下的不少脍炙人口的词章，却流传千古。杨书案写李后主沉浮的一生，写他一生的悲剧，同写黄巢、秦始皇等人的历史悲剧不一样，不是把他放在那个社会动荡、阶级矛盾尖锐的社会历史背景下加以观照，较多地表现这一悲剧的社会历史含量，而是把李后主所处的时代的社会历史背景淡化，更多的把李后主作为一个诗人来写，从文化心理的角度加以深入地开掘，使悲剧意识同文化意识较好地融合起来，让我们既看到一个曾经统治江南大片土地称为南唐国主，后来又成为赵宋王朝俘虏的南唐末代皇帝的历史悲剧，又更多地看到一个才华横溢、善良多情的诗人充满文化色彩的人生悲剧。由于杨书案在创作中选择了从文化心理方面进行深入的开掘，以便把悲剧意识同文化意识较好地融合起来这一新的角度，这部作品自然出现了新的艺术风貌。
    首先，从结构上看，他略前详后，写南唐同赵宋交战以至金陵城破，李煜率数百名嫔妃旧臣被掳北上汴梁，这部分是略写，只占全书的三分之一左右，而李煜等被掳北上居于汴梁，过着屈辱的俘虏生活，直至被赵光义毒死，则放开笔墨详写。作者之所以这样安排，是为了更充分地展示李煜的悲剧性格，因为李煜从尊贵的帝王沦为俘虏，虽然仍有较丰厚的生活待遇，但是连封号“违命侯”都是带侮辱性的，更不必说严加监视，不准南唐旧臣同他往来，以及宣召他的妻妾通宵伴宴了。正是在这种境遇下，李煜进一步尝到了作为阶下囚的苦酒，也进一步激发了他的创作激情，他的词章中大部分脍炙人口流传至今的篇章大都是被掳囚居于汴京礼贤宅里这短短的几年间创作的。他屡屡受辱，而性格懦弱又不敢反抗，于是激愤之情往往发为动人的词章。杨书案几乎写了李后主每首著名的词章创作的本事，并摘引了这些词章。这些本事和词章就构成了相当迷人的文化色彩。而作者并不就此止步，而是透过这些词章的创作，进一步开掘了李煜那“官场外行，词坛里手”，一个词人由于历史的错误，而成为误国的南唐后主，最终过着豪华而屈辱的俘虏生活的文化心理和悲剧性格。这是开掘李煜的文化心理和悲剧性格的一个方面。
    其次，我们还可以从作品中看到，作者还写了李煜的种种爱情经历和悲剧结局。这一方面显示出他的风流多情，一方面也从另一个角度开掘了他的文化心理和悲剧性格。且以他同窅娘的爱情悲剧为例。窅娘原是江南一个美丽可爱的采莲姑娘，十六岁那年因在家乡的盛会上扮演莲花仙子跳莲花舞，被南唐选美宫使选中，送进宫中，成了李煜的莲妃。她之所以进宫，并不是贪恋宫中的荣华富贵，而是听了选美宫使哼唱的李后主的一首词和夸耀李后主“和善宽厚”“多才多艺”的一番话，带着某种向往进入南唐宫中的。在宫中，李煜不惜重金为她铸造了金莲花，又在南朝废帝室宝卷的潘妃所跳的“莲花舞”的基础上，共同创造了新颖的“金莲舞”。可以这么说，正是在这种共同的艺术创造中，李后主与窅娘萌生了爱情，他们之间的关系，不是一般意义上的帝王与后妃的关系。唯其如此，当窅娘随李后主被掳北上汴京后，在礼贤宅里为了排遣李后主的忧闷，重新练习金莲舞；而当赵光义从金陵南唐宫中运来了金莲花逼迫窅娘在荷花节上当众为她表演金莲舞时，窅娘义无反顾纵身跃出了金莲花座，直向荷花池中，以身殉情。杨书案用了十节的篇幅（占全书三分之一）来写这段爱情悲剧，可谓用心良苦。他一方面固然是通过这段故事来进一步开掘李煜的悲剧性格和文化心理；另一方面则无意中写了一段我国古代的舞蹈史诗。当然这动人的史话中又浸渍着首创中国芭蕾舞的舞蹈家窅娘的血和泪，也映现了窅娘动人的形象，从而焕发出更浓厚的文化色彩。
