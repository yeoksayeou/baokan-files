In the United States, although the law prohibits the use of child labor, the problem of child labor has been worsening in recent years. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, there were 22,508 cases of illegal child labor in the 1989 fiscal year, reaching the highest point since the Child Labor Prohibition Act was implemented in 1938.

Investigations have shown that the ages of these child laborers are mostly around 10 years old. They work approximately 20-40 hours per week. Sometimes, they work from 4 PM after school until 9 PM in the evening, and on weekends, they work until 10 PM or even 11 PM.

The employers of these child laborers are mostly candy stores and fast-food restaurants. The store owners give the hired children some chocolates, fruit candies, and other small snacks to sell on the streets. Generally, for every box of $5 chocolates sold, the child laborer gets $1.

The police have discovered that behind these child laborers, there are some "underground bosses." These individuals use the names of certain companies to deceive young, naive children, making them sell small snacks on the streets. They often withhold the children's wages. These fake companies frequently change their names, making them difficult to track down.

The issue of child labor has caused concern among parents and educators. Teachers in some schools in Washington have complained that some children go to work after school, leaving no time for homework or reading, and they fall asleep in class the next day. More people are worried that if children have money, they might be tempted by bad influences and end up on the path to crime.

    美国童工问题严重
    在美国，尽管法律规定不得使用童工。但近年来，美国童工问题仍日趋严重。据美国劳工部统计，1989年预算年度，共发生了22508起违法使用童工事件，达到了自1938年禁止使用童工法实施以来的最高点。
    据调查，童工的年龄大都在10岁左右。他们每周大约工作20—40小时，有时从下午4时放学工作到晚上9时，周末则要延长到10时或11时。
    雇用童工的大都是一些糖果店、快餐店。店老板分给被雇用的童工一些巧克力、水果糖等零售食品，让他们沿街叫卖。一般情况下，童工出售一盒5美元的巧克力，可分得1美元。
    警方发现，在这些童工的背后还有一些“地下工头”。这些家伙打着某某公司的招牌欺骗年幼无知的孩子，让孩子帮他们沿街叫卖小食品，并且经常克扣孩子们的工钱。这些假公司常常变换名子，很难查找。
    童工问题已经引起了学生家长和教育界人士的担忧。华盛顿一些学校的老师抱怨说，有些孩子放学后就去打工，既没有时间做作业，也没有时间看书，第二天在课堂上打瞌睡。更多的人则担心，孩子们有了钱，若受到坏人的引诱，难免会走上犯罪道路。　（丁）
