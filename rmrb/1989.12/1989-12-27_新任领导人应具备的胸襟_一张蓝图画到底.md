Currently, the short-term behavior that has emerged in enterprises after contract responsibility systems have been implemented has drawn attention, and relevant departments are taking steps to address this issue. However, the short-term behavior exhibited by administrative leaders during their terms seems to be overlooked. Little do people realize that the negative effects and aftereffects of this behavior are even more severe.

After a new leadership team took office in a certain township, they were full of ambition and confidence, planning out their "grand blueprint" for the term. This plan started from scratch, setting aside the work plans that the previous leadership team had already implemented. Long-term benefits and infrastructure projects (such as developing forestry and building water conservancy facilities) were either not mentioned or mentioned very little, with the focus solely on short-term projects that yield quick results. The reasoning was that focusing on foundational work or long-term benefits would not produce results within this term, and thus would not showcase their "achievements." This shortsighted, exploitative approach, seeking immediate gains, has significant drawbacks. It inevitably causes a disconnect with the previous term's work, leading to a lack of continuity in work and planning. Without considering the construction and corresponding investment in infrastructure, and instead focusing on gaining immediate "achievements," it will inevitably create a passive and damaging situation for the next term's work. It will also bring losses to the state, collective, and people.

In my opinion, after a new leadership team takes office, they should thoroughly understand the work of the previous term, proceed from reality, and develop a mid-to-long-term plan with continuity. They should have the broad-mindedness of "planting trees for future generations to enjoy the shade" and stick to "completing one blueprint."

    新任领导人应具备的胸襟
    一张蓝图画到底
    眼下，企业承包后出现的短期行为已引起人们的关注，有关部门正在着手解决这一问题。但是，行政领导人任期内的短期行为似乎还不为人所理会。殊不知，由此带来的负效应和后遗症更为严重。
    某乡的新班子上任后，雄心勃勃，踌躇满志，规划了本届任期内的“宏图大略”。这个规划另起炉灶，把上届领导班子已经实施的工作计划撇在一边；对长远利益和基础设施的建设（如发展林业，兴修水利等）或只字不提，或提之甚少，重点只放在发展
  “吹糠见米”的短期项目上。其理由是：抓基础工作或长远利益在本届任期内不会“挂果”，显示不出自己的“政绩”。这种急功近利、竭泽而渔、目光短浅的做法，弊端可谓不小。它难免与上届工作脱档断线，使工作和规划缺乏连续性；不考虑基础设施的建设和相应投入，掠夺性地获取“立竿见影”的“政绩”，必然会给下届工作造成被动和损害，同时也会给国家、集体和人民带来损失。
    我认为，新班子上任后，需要对上届的工作作全面了解，从实际出发，搞好中长期规划并保持连续性。要有“前人栽树，后人乘凉”的襟怀，把“一张蓝图画到底”。四川大邑县委办公室　马泽泉
