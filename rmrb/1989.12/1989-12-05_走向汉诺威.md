	With the advantage of strong technical capabilities, the staff of the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, are striving to forge a new path in the overseas market. They are working tirelessly, seizing every moment to create an outward-looking high-tech industry. In a short period, they successfully developed the "Legend" Q286 microcomputer—

	Heading to Hanover

	By Fei Weiwei, People's Daily Reporter

	Hanover, a city in northern West Germany known for its international trade fairs, hosted a grand opening of the International Office, Information, and Telecommunications Technology Fair in March 1989.

	In the computer hall, a small booth of just over 30 square meters belonging to a Chinese company caught the attention of international businesspeople. The new type of microcomputer on display, with its superior performance and affordable price, drew people away from the competing products. By the time the 10-day fair ended, this company, making its debut on the international market, had secured orders from over 20 countries, including Europe and America: 2073 complete microcomputers and 2483 mainboards.

	This company is the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The microcomputer is the latest product of the year—Legend Q286.

	Forge a New Path in Overseas Markets

	On April 16, 1988, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the Institute of Computing Technology held a grand meeting. The microphone carried the confident voice of General Manager Liu Chuanzhi throughout the venue:

	"Although our company's market share in the domestic market is steadily expanding, the 70,000 units of computers exported annually only account for 0.38% of the world's annual microcomputer sales. Life is short, and we must seize the moment! We must create an outward-looking high-tech industry and forge a new path in overseas markets!"

	Everyone was aware that the Institute of Computing Technology was established at the end of 1984, and by 1987, its output value had reached 73 million yuan, a remarkable start. However, this was still just the beginning. Yet this fledgling bird was now ready to take to the skies! When Liu Chuanzhi confidently declared the march towards overseas markets at the Great Hall of the People, the Institute of Computing Technology had already taken the first step in its overseas development strategy: establishing a bridgehead in Hong Kong, an international economic and trade center, and selecting a partner—Hong Kong Dao Yuan Computer Company. This company was well-versed in international computer market dynamics and business rules, making it an ideal guide for the technically strong but somewhat naive Institute of Computing Technology. Additionally, they partnered with a financially robust Chinese company.

	The three companies jointly established the Legend Computer Company, which officially opened in Hong Kong on June 23, 1988. Within just seven months of opening, the net profit exceeded three times the investment.

	The Institute of Computing Technology, through sincere cooperation, humbly learned and accumulated experience, while keeping a keen eye on new product development opportunities. By the end of 1988, they discovered that personal computers had an extremely broad market, dominated by products from Taiwan and South Korea. The Institute of Computing Technology, known as the national team of China's computer industry, decided to use the "Tian Dan's Horse Racing" strategy: competing with their superior horses against others' average ones, concentrating their strengths to lead in the personal microcomputer field—developing the Legend Q286 microcomputer, which meets global standards.

	Chasing the Wave

	In January 1989, the development of the Legend Q286 microcomputer entered the final sample testing phase. The microcomputer designer, Engineer Ni Guangnan, who had successfully developed the Legend Chinese System, a product awarded the National Science and Technology Progress First-Class Award, flew to Hong Kong on the eve of the Spring Festival to test the sample. He never expected that on New Year's Eve, the Hong Kong girls responsible for microcomputer testing, despite his high salary and pleading, still left one by one. Ni Guangnan was so anxious that his mouth was full of blisters. He took the sample and rushed to the airport, not even stopping for a moment to buy a small gift for his wife, who had been supporting him tirelessly for years and was celebrating her birthday on the second day of the New Year.

	On the first day of the New Year, as soon as Ni Guangnan returned to Beijing, he and more than a dozen colleagues started working in the testing room from early in the morning, day and night, for five consecutive days until all 54 test items passed smoothly.

	The strong desire to go global burned like a fire in the hearts of every member of the Institute of Computing Technology. Deputy Researcher Qin Meifang always played a supporting role. During the three-month development of the Legend Q286 microcomputer, she did not rest on a single weekend, not even once catching the elevator in her apartment building because she worked late into the night every day. The nearly 50-year-old woman always supported her tired body after a long day of work, slowly climbing the 10 flights of stairs to her home....

	They knew that if they missed the March computer trade fair in Hanover, they would lose half a year.

	Is half a year really that important? The people of the Institute of Computing Technology answered: If we do not work twice as hard as others, we will never be able to make up the gap with the world. If others are walking fast, then we must run!

	Competing in Hong Kong

	In March of this year, when the good news from Hanover reached the Institute of Computing Technology, many people were overjoyed.

	At this time, a major competitor in Hong Kong keenly sensed the imminent threat from the Institute of Computing Technology, which had just emerged in the microcomputer market. Within a month, they repeatedly reduced prices. Liu Chuanzhi in Beijing could not sit still. In June, he flew to Hong Kong with a group of capable colleagues, stepping onto the stage of fierce competition. While responding with price cuts, they did everything possible to maximize cost reductions, proposing the slogan "100% Qualified." They strictly controlled every link from procurement to production, dispatching personnel to oversee factories and inspect components one by one to ensure zero defects; when there were not enough product inspectors, the general manager took the lead in filling in. In a few months, the product's first-pass yield rate increased from 40% to 95%, and the qualified rate of sold products reached 100%.

	In September of this year, a Belgian customer bought one Legend Q286 microcomputer mainboard, tested it, and was satisfied. Later, he bought 10, 100, and 300 boards. As a result, he found a problem in the 300 mainboards. Upon hearing the news, the company's technical staff calmly replied: It must be your machine that has the problem. They helped the customer check, and indeed found the issue in his machine's chassis. The Belgian customer smiled and immediately placed an order for another 1,000 boards.

	The Institute of Computing Technology finally weathered the storm and stood firm in the fierce competition. From April to October this year, their six-month sales exceeded 140 million Hong Kong dollars. The monthly order quantity for Legend Q286 microcomputers and mainboards reached 3,000 units (boards), selling to more than 30 countries and regions around the world.

	On November 15, the Beijing Legend Computer Group Company, consisting of 14 subsidiaries in China and abroad, 2 research centers, 3 production bases, 1 training center, and 31 service stations across the country, was officially established.

	On the road to creating a high-tech outward-looking industry, they took one solid step at a time.

    凭借技术力量雄厚的优势，到海外市场闯一条新路，中科院计算所公司职工奋力拚搏，只争朝夕，开创外向型高科技产业，在短期内研制成功的“联想”Q286微机——
    走向汉诺威
    本报记者　费伟伟
    汉诺威，联邦德国北部一座以举办博览会而闻名世界的工业重镇。1989年3月，一个国际办公室、信息、电讯技术交易会在这里隆重开幕。
    在电脑厅，一家中国公司的仅30多平方米的小展台引起了各国客商的注意。这里展出的一种新型微型计算机，以其优异的性能、便宜的价格，把人们从参展的同类产品前吸引过来。为期10天的交易会降下帷幕时，这家首次在国际市场亮相的公司竟一举获得来自欧美等20多个国家客商的订单：整套微机2073台，微机核心的主机板2483块。
    这家公司，就是中国科学院计算所公司。这种微机，就是本年度问世的最新产品——联想Q286微机。
    到海外闯一条新路
    1988年4月16日，北京人民大会堂。计算所公司在此隆重集会。麦克风把总经理柳传志充满信心的声音传遍整个会场：
      “尽管我们公司国内市场的份额稳步扩大，但是，我国计算机海外市场7万台的年销量只占世界微机年销总量的0.38％。人生能有几回搏？！我们要开创外向型高科技产业，到海外闯一条新路！”
    人们十分清楚，中科院计算所公司1984年底才成立，1987年产值已达7300万元，堪称起步不凡。然而，这终究只是起步。可这只羽毛尚不十分丰满的鸟儿现在却要搏击长空啦！当柳传志满怀信心地在人民大会堂发出向海外进军的宣言时，计算所公司的海外发展战略已经迈出了第一步，在香港这个国际经济贸易中心建立走向世界的桥头堡，选定了合作伙伴——香港导远电脑公司。这个公司对国际计算机市场的信息动态、经营规律等十分熟悉，正可为技术雄厚却耳目不灵的计算所公司牵桥引路。此外，他们还联合了一家资金雄厚的中资公司。
    三家合作的联想电脑公司于1988年6月23日在香港隆重开业。开业后仅7个月，净利润就超过投资3倍。
    计算所公司在精诚合作中虚心学习、积累经验，同时眼观六路，耳听八方，悉心寻找新产品开发的突破口。到1988年底，他们发现，个人用计算机具有极为广阔的市场，而主导这个市场的只是台湾、南朝鲜的产品。享有中国计算机界国家队之誉的计算所公司决定，采用“田单赛马”的方法：以自己的上乘之马与人家的中乘之马比赛，集中优势力量，在个人微机这个领域力拔头筹——开发具有世界潮流水平的联想Q286微机。
    追赶浪潮
    1989年1月，联想Q286微机开发进入样机最后调试阶段。微机设计者、曾成功地研制出国家科技进步一等奖获奖产品联想汉字系统的总工程师倪光南，春节前夕又一次飞抵香港，调试样机。他万万没有想到，除夕之日，负责微机测试的香港小姐不管他怎么高薪恳聘还是一个个翩然离去了。倪光南急得满嘴起泡，带上样机直奔机场，竟顾不上小停片刻，给多年来任劳任怨支持自己工作、年初二过生日的妻子买一件小小的礼品。
    大年初一，刚回北京的倪光南就和十几位同事一起，一清早起就扎进测试室，不分白天黑夜地赶，一连干了5天，直到54个项目的检测全部顺利通过。
    走向世界的强烈愿望就像一把火燃烧在计算所公司每个人的心里。副研究员秦梅芳始终甘当配角。在联想Q286微机3个多月的研制过程中，她没歇过一个星期天，甚至没有一次赶上过公寓的电梯，因为每天一干就是深夜。年近半百的她，总是撑着忙碌了一天的身子，一级一级慢慢爬到10层楼上的家里。……
    他们知道，假如赶不上今年3月份汉诺威的计算机交易会，就会失掉半年时间。
    半年，果真就那么重要么？计算所公司的人回答：如果我们不比别人加倍努力，那就永远无法弥补我们和世界的差距，如果别人是快步走的话，那么我们就必须快步跑！
    逐鹿香港
    今年3月，当来自汉诺威的好消息传到计算所公司时，许多人喜极而泣。
    这时香港一家最大的计算机竞争对手敏锐地预察到计算所公司这个在微机市场刚刚崭露头角的新手即将构成的极大威胁，一个月内接连几次降价。在北京的柳传志坐不住了，今年6月，他带着公司一帮得力干将飞抵香港，踏上了激烈竞争的前台。他们在相应降价的同时，想方设法、最大限度降低产品成本，提出“100％合格”的口号。在采购、生产等各个环节严格把关，采购元器件时派人坐镇工厂一件一件挑，确保万无一失；产品检测人员不足时，总经理带头顶班。几个月时间，使产品一次成品率由40％提高到95％，销售产品的合格率达100％。
    今年9月，一家比利时客商买了1块联想Q286微机的主机板，测试后很放心，以后买了10块、100块、300块。结果，他在300块主机板中发现了问题。公司技术人员闻讯后十分坦然地回答：肯定是你的机器有问题。他们帮这位客商一检查，果然在他机器的机箱中找到了症结。这位比利时客商笑了，当即拍板，再购1000块。
    计算所公司终于顶住狂风恶浪，在激烈的竞争中稳稳站定了脚。从今年4月到10月，他们6个月的营业额就超过1.4亿港币，联想Q286微机整机和主机板月订量达3000台（块），行销世界30多个国家和地区。
    11月15日，由海内外14家联想子公司、2个研究中心、3个生产基地、1个培训中心和遍及全国的31个服务站组成的北京联想计算机集团公司宣告成立。
    在创建高科技外向型产业的道路上，他们一步一个脚印，走得那么坚实。
