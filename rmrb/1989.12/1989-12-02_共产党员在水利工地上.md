Not long ago on a Sunday, a reporter came to the Hongnianggang waterworks site in Sanhe County, Hebei. Standing on the riverbank bridge, looking far into the east-west water diversion canal that stretches ten kilometers, one could see over twelve thousand farmers from the entire county sweating and working hard. More than three thousand officials from party and government agencies and enterprises were participating in voluntary labor. Up close, the farmers were clear about their responsibilities and the order was excellent. The battle flags fluttering in the wind on the construction site read: "Develop water conservancy, promote agriculture."

"Starting with myself, let's revive the party's prestige." This was the oath taken by the Communist Party members of Liflagang Township at the water conservancy project mobilization meeting.

The construction site in this township is 221 meters long, and 800 water control soldiers are mainly responsible for dredging and expanding the river channel. The task is difficult, there is no sludge pump, and most farmers did not bring rubber boots. What to do? Hundreds of eyes looked at the township party committee secretary, Wang Liang. Wang Liang did not say a word, rolled up his pants, and without hesitation, jumped into the black mud. Then, the deputy secretary of the township party committee, Wang Yibo, went down, followed by the party branch secretaries of nineteen villages. The action of the two-level secretaries was a silent order, and 120 party members and 7,000 farmers rushed down, launching a battle to overcome difficulties.

"I am old, I can't push the cart, but I can load the cart. Even if I can't load the cart, I can still give some advice. Why not allow me to go to the construction site?" The old Communist Party member Zhang He from Dabu Village, Huangzhuang Town, repeatedly requested to participate in the water conservancy construction. This "old river worker" has been on more than ten major water conservancy construction sites over the decades. Now, he has come to the new site, helping to load the cart one moment and pull the cart the next.

During rest times, the construction site echoed with songs, applause, and laughter. The Sanhe County Agricultural Water Conservancy Engineering Art Troupe was performing. This troupe, composed of fifteen county-level government officials, was led by Li, the head of the county propaganda department. Every time the performance began on the construction site, he would raise his voice to encourage: "Dear farmer comrades, you have worked hard. Sit down, have a smoke, listen to a song, laugh a bit, and relieve your fatigue!"

"We are striving for both material and spiritual civilization." County Party Secretary Qi Haodong talked with us as we walked to the command post of Lingshan Township. In the simple shed, the township broadcaster Yu Yalan was excitedly broadcasting the latest news. The township party committee secretary, Yang Baogui, whose trouser legs were covered in mud, told us: "It has been nearly ten years since we last undertook such a large project. This time, we have restored the tradition, boosted morale, trained cadres, and benefited the people." They established a temporary party branch on the construction site and set up an on-site radio station. On the first day of work, the loudspeaker shouted that cadres were participating in labor, and the party branch secretaries of all twenty villages in the township were on the front line. The next day, the propaganda of party members leading the way, eighty-seven Communist Party members went to the most arduous places. Yang Baogui finally said: "We also educate cadres to care more about the farmers." The party branch secretary of Liu Li Village, Wang Yujing, thoughtfully provided for the masses, sending bucket after bucket of hot water to the construction site during the day and basin after basin of hot water for washing feet into the dormitory at night.

The broad masses of farmers saw that the good style of the Communist Party members had returned. In Zhuzhuang Village, Zhuzhuang Township, the fifty-five-year-old farmer Li Zhiguang has been digging canals since he was in his twenties and has participated in more than ten major projects. This time, when he heard that water conservancy projects were being carried out again, he brought his two sons to the Hongnianggang construction site.

People said: "The old river worker has brought out new apprentices."

    共产党员在水利工地上
    本报记者　段存章
    不久前的一个星期天。记者来到河北三河县红娘港水利工地。站在滨河桥头，远望泃河东水西调十公里的开挖渠道工地上，全县有一万二千名农民挥汗奋战，三千多名党政机关和企事业单位干部参加义务劳动；近看农民责任分明，秩序井然。工地上迎风招展的战旗上写着：“兴修水利，发展农业。”
    “从我做起，重振党威。”这是李旗庄乡共产党员在水利工程动员建设大会上发出的誓言。
    这个乡的工地有二百二十一米长，八百名治水将士担负的主要任务是清淤扩挖河道。难度大，没有抽浆机，大多数农民没带雨靴，怎么办？几百双眼睛看着乡党委书记王亮，王亮一句话也没讲，麻利地挽起裤腿，毫不犹豫地跳进了黑乎乎的淤泥中。接着，乡党委副书记王一波下去了，十九个村的党支部书记紧跟着也下去了。两级书记的这一举动是无声的命令，一百二十名党员和七千名农民蜂拥而下，展开了一场攻坚战。
    “我年纪老了，推不动车，还能装车，就是车也装不动了，总还能出些主意吧，为啥不批准我上工地？”皇庄镇大卜庄老共产党员张贺一连三次要求参加水利建设。这位“老河工”，几十年来，转战十多处大型水利建设工地。如今，他又来到新的工地，一会帮助装车，一会帮助拉车。
    休息的时候，工地上响起了歌声、掌声、笑声。那是三河县农田水利工程文艺慰问团正在演出节目。这支由十五名县直机关干部组成的文艺演出队，领头的是县委宣传部李部长。每次工地演出开始，他总要提起大嗓门鼓动几句：“亲爱的农民同志们，你们辛苦了，坐下来，抽一支烟，听一支歌，笑一笑呀，解一解疲劳吧！”
    “我们是两个文明一齐抓。”县委书记齐浩东同志与我们边谈边走，来到灵山乡工地指挥部。简陋的工棚里，乡广播员于亚兰正在激动地广播“立马成书”（快讯）的新人新事。裤腿上沾满泥巴的乡党委书记杨宝贵对我们说：“近十多年没有搞过这么大的工程了，这次恢复了传统，振奋了精神，锻炼了干部，为人民造了福。”他们在工地上成立了临时党支部，办起了现场广播站。开工头一天，喇叭里呐喊的是干部参加劳动，全乡二十个村支部书记上了第一线。第二天，宣传党员带头，八十七名共产党员到最艰苦的地方去。杨宝贵最后说：“我们还教育干部多关心农民。”刘里村党支部书记王玉芹替群众想得周到，白天把一桶桶热水送上工地，晚上又把一盆盆洗脚的热水送进工棚。
    广大农民看到共产党员的好作风回来了。中赵甫乡诸葛店村五十五岁的农民李志广，从二十来岁就开始外出挖河道，参加过十多期大工程。这次听说又搞水利工程，他带上两个儿子一起来到了红娘港工地。
    人们说：“老河工又带出新徒弟。”
