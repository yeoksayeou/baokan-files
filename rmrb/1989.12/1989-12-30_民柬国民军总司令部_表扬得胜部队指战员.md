Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 28th.

The General Headquarters of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea wrote a letter on December 26th commending the troops who liberated the city of Anlong Veng in Oddar Meanchey Province, encouraging them to achieve even greater victories.

The letter of commendation stated that since November 17th, over the course of more than a month, the troops of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, together with the people, fought bravely on the Anlong Veng battlefield in Oddar Meanchey Province. They captured and controlled enemy strongholds along the 69th Highway, liberated the city of Anlong Veng, cut off the 69th Highway, killed and wounded over 300 enemy soldiers, captured more than 200, and seized hundreds of various weapons. These victories demonstrate that the enemy's defensive line along the southern side of the Cardamom Mountains has completely collapsed, opening a path for the Cambodian resistance forces to advance deeper into the interior.

The letter of commendation also said that the General Headquarters hopes that all the troops on the Anlong Veng battlefield in Oddar Meanchey Province will unite with the local people and press forward to victory.

    表扬信说，自11月17日以来的一个多月中，民柬国民军指战员与人民一起，在奥多棉吉省安龙文战场英勇作战，攻克和控制了69号公路沿线的敌军据点、解放了安龙文县城、切断了69号公路、打死打伤敌军300多人、俘获200多人、缴获各种武器数百件。这些胜利表明，敌军在扁担山脉南侧修筑的防线已全线崩溃，为柬埔寨抵抗力量深入内地打开了通道。
