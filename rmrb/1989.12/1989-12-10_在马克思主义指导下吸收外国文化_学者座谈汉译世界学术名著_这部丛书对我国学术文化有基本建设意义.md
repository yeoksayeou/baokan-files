Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 9th.

Hu Qiaomu comrade referred to the translation and publication of the "Chinese Translation of World Academic Classics" series as a "major project of fundamental significance to China's academic and cultural development." Over 60 renowned scholars from across the country, invited by the Commercial Press, gathered in the capital recently to discuss the future publication plans for this series.

The discussion was lively, with scholars freely expressing their views and drawing inspiration from the exchange.

The Commercial Press's strategic vision for this publishing plan has garnered attention from leaders at all levels and from the academic community both domestically and internationally. Deng Xiaoping comrade once instructed in 1984: "We should take several decades to translate and publish all the classics of world academia that have been recognized." Through the collective efforts of translators and editors, this series has been published in five volumes from 1982 to the present year, totaling 230 titles.

During the discussion, scholars highly praised the Commercial Press's long-standing rigorous publishing standards and the high-quality works it has published. They also discussed how to better carry out the translation of classics in the future. Everyone agreed with Hu Qiaomu comrade's suggestion to further expand the scope of classic translations, noting that the series has previously focused on translating Western classics and prioritizing the publication of works representing the three sources of Marxism, providing a batch of urgently needed materials for China's socialist cultural construction and theoretical research. However, as significant progress has been made in introducing important academic works from the Western capitalist ascendant period, efforts should now be directed towards translating and publishing academic works from Eastern countries and Third World nations. Scholars proposed many specific topics in various disciplines, particularly emphasizing the importance of translating works on important national and social movements in various countries, as well as research and critical works on modern capitalism. They suggested that for contemporary academic works on new trends, careful analysis and comparison should be conducted, and selections should be made judiciously, neither rejecting all nor indiscriminately including everything.

Scholars hoped that the publishing department would maintain a rigorous attitude of "quality over quantity," especially for the translation of classics, and strictly control the quality. They believed that improving the quality of publications should not be limited to the main text of the books but should also focus on the writing of prefaces, postscripts, annotations, and indexes. Especially for prefaces and postscripts, it is necessary to provide necessary analysis and evaluation of the original works to guide readers.

Lin Erwei, the general manager of the Commercial Press, pointed out at the meeting that critically absorbing foreign culture is a firm strategic decision under the guidance of Marxist thought. Currently, emphasizing the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization does not mean that we adopt a closed and resistant attitude towards foreign culture. He hoped that the national academic and translation communities would join them in completing the honorable and arduous task of publishing the "Chinese Translation of World Academic Classics" series.

The discussion was held from December 5th to 9th in Beijing. Hu Qiaomu comrade sent a congratulatory message from outside the city. Relevant department heads Li Yan, Gong Yuzhi, and Song Mumu attended and spoke at the meeting.

    在马克思主义指导下吸收外国文化
    学者座谈汉译世界学术名著
    这部丛书对我国学术文化有基本建设意义
    新华社北京12月9日电　（记者朱维新）胡乔木同志把翻译出版《汉译世界学术名著丛书》称作为“对我国学术文化有基本建设意义的重大工程”。60多位全国知名的社会科学学者应商务印书馆之邀，近日聚会首都，对这部丛书下一步出版规划进行了座谈。
    座谈会开得很活跃，学者们畅所欲言，各抒己见，并且从中受到鼓舞。
    商务印书馆这一具有战略眼光的出书计划，得到各级领导和国内外学术界的普遍关注。邓小平同志1984年曾经指示：“要用几十年的时间把世界古今有定评的学术著作都翻译出版。”经过译校编者的共同努力，这部丛书从1982年到今年已出版5辑，共收书230种。
    座谈会上，学者们高度评价了商务印书馆一贯严谨的出版作风和出版了大量质量上乘的作品，同时对今后如何更好地开展名著译事进行了讨论。大家非常赞同胡乔木同志关于进一步拓宽名著翻译选题的建议，认为这部丛书过去侧重西方古典名著的翻译，优先安排有关马克思主义三大来源的代表作出版，为我国社会主义文化建设和理论研究提供了一批急需的读物。但是在介绍西方资本主义上升时期重要学术著作已取得一定成果的时候，应着力开拓东方国家和第三世界国家学术著作的翻译出版。学者们在各个学科方面提出了许多具体选题意见，其中特别强调要注重翻译各国重要的民族运动、社会运动的研究论著，以及现代资本主义的研究和批判性著作。他们提出，对于当代新思潮的学术著作，要多加分析比较，谨慎选择，既不一概摒除，也不滥选乱收。
    学者们希望出版部门要坚持宁缺勿滥的严谨态度，对名著译作尤其要严格要求，把好质量关。他们认为，提高出版物质量，不只限于书籍正文，还要重视序、跋、注释、索引的编写工作。特别是序、跋，应对原著作出必要的分析和评价，对读者起到指引的作用。
    商务印书馆总经理林尔蔚在会上指出，批判地吸收外国文化是我们在马克思主义思想指导下一项坚定不移的战略决策。当前强调坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，并不意味着我们对外国文化采取封闭抵制的态度。他希望全国学术界和翻译界同他们一道，合力完成《汉译世界学术名著丛书》这一光荣而又艰巨的出版工程。
    座谈会于12月5日至9日在北京举行。胡乔木同志从外地专门发来贺信。有关部门负责人李彦、龚育之、宋木文等到会讲了话。
