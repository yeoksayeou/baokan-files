Title: The Jiangnan Scholar Ma Xiaochun

Ma Xiaochun's talent for strategizing on the go board is extraordinary.

This nine-dan Go master has an exceptional memory. During a game, he often looks around but rarely stares at the board, deep in thought. Initially, opponents who are not familiar with him see him casually placing pieces, appearing indifferent, and often develop various misconceptions. Only after losing and reviewing the game do they realize that Ma Xiaochun can, with a single glance, observe the entire board, memorizing every detail of the chess situation, calculating each move, and acting decisively without rushing. Thus, they can only exclaim that they were tricked and acknowledge their bad luck.

More than ten years ago, when Ma Xiaochun first entered the scene, he quickly gained the nickname "God of Calculation" with his quick reactions and precise calculations. According to those in the know, from his early days of showing promise to his current dominance in the Go world, Ma Xiaochun has participated in countless battles on the black and white chessboard. However, the number of times he has run out of time before his opponent is extremely rare, almost negligible. Nevertheless, this extraordinary talent has also brought him "unjust accusations." For example, sometimes he determines the outcome early on, believing there is no turning point, and stands up to concede before the end of the game. Observers who are still pondering often feel surprised and cannot accept it, even thinking he is arrogant and disdainful.

A former Go master once described Ma Xiaochun like this: he is of average height, thin and weak, unremarkable in appearance, and walks with a slight hunch, seeming to always lean to one side. When he speaks, he has a slight Zhejiang accent, and the most annoying thing is that he often pauses in the wrong places, making people both anxious and uncomfortable, unable to understand what he is trying to express. However, inside his head is a brilliant Go brain.

Nowadays, Ma Xiaochun's chess skills are renowned, along with Nie Weiping's royal demeanor and Liu Xiaoguang's boldness, making them famous in the Go world to the point where many people are familiar with them. However, his talents outside of Go are little known.

Last August, Ma Xiaochun bought a Star Sea piano and moved it into his dormitory. Normally, chess players prefer quiet environments and cannot tolerate high-decibel noises, so this action seems taboo. Surprisingly, the piano, which rings almost every evening, not only did not provoke the anger of his teammates but also earned Ma Xiaochun the nickname "Amateur Richard."

Ma Xiaochun learned to play the piano under the guidance of a student from the Music Academy, who has no connection to Go and does not admire celebrities, holding himself in high regard. However, after a few lessons, he was amazed by Ma Xiaochun's musical understanding and praised him highly. As an outsider, I cannot appreciate the weight of this natural talent, but I find that Ma Xiaochun's ability to memorize sheet music is even more remarkable than his ability to memorize chess moves, possessing a mysterious charm.

In addition to practicing the piano for an hour or two each day for self-entertainment, Ma Xiaochun spends most of his free time writing. Perhaps soon, people will see his first book published.

In this book, which has not yet been completed but has already been pre-ordered by Shu Rong Publishing House, Ma Xiaochun creatively plans to combine ancient and modern Go strategies, then categorize them according to the "Thirty-Six Stratagems," providing a unique path for future learners.

About three years ago, he and his teammate Wang Jianhong began this innovative work.

The other day, I asked him about the progress of the book. Ma Xiaochun smiled faintly and said, "Thirty-one stratagems have been completed, totaling about 150,000 words. However, the remaining ones are the toughest, like 'Pointing at a mulberry tree to curse someone' and 'Feigning madness,' and I need to find a new approach to write them."

    江南才子马晓春
    本报记者　缪鲁
    马晓春运筹纹枰的天赋之高，令人叹为观止。
    这位九段围棋国手记忆力非凡，对弈中，他常常左顾右盼，而极少凝视盘面，作苦思冥想状。初时，不明底细的对手见他随手落子，一副漫不经心的模样，总免不了产生种种错觉，乃至败后复盘，方知马晓春竟能于一瞥之间，通观全局，将盘上棋势巨细无遗地尽纳脑中，着着盘算，谋定而后出，并无一子轻率。于是，只好连呼上当，自认倒霉。
    早在十多年前，出道伊始的马晓春便以敏捷的反应，精确的算度赢得“神算子”的美称。据知情者称，从当年初露锋芒，到如今睥睨弈林，马晓春在黑白子沙场上已不知身经多少战事，然而，对局时他先于对手读秒的次数却寥寥无几，屈指可计。不过，这份常人难及的天分，也使他蒙受过“不白之冤”。比如，有时他早早算定了最后胜负，自忖再无回天之计，便不待局终起身认输，而尚在推敲的观战者则往往大感意外，难以接受，甚至于认为他当争不争，傲慢无边。
    一位前围棋国手曾这样形容马晓春：他中等个头、文弱瘦削，貌不惊人，走起路来肩头一耸一耸，似乎总在往一边倾斜；讲起话来，略带浙南乡音，最要命的是常在不该停顿的地方打住，害得人既着急又别扭，搞不清楚他究竟想要表达些什么。然而，在他的颅腔里却偏偏长着聪明的围棋大脑。
    如今，马晓春的棋才横溢，与聂卫平的王者气质、刘小光的包天虎胆并称弈林，几乎到了许多人熟知的程度，然而，他在纹枰之外的才华却鲜为人知。
    去年8月，马晓春买了架星海牌钢琴搬进宿舍。按说，下棋的人喜静厌闹，最受不了高分贝声响的刺激，此举无疑是犯忌之事。谁知，这架几乎每天傍晚都要鸣响的乐器，非但没有引起队友的公愤，反而使马晓春添了个“业余理查德”的雅号。
    马晓春学琴，拜了音乐学院一个学生为师，此人与棋无缘，且不崇拜明星，自视甚高，可几堂课下来，他对马晓春的音乐领悟力已是惊诧不已，赞不绝口。我这个外行自然无法体会这种天生禀赋的分量，只觉得马晓春过目不忘的记乐谱本事，比他记棋谱有过之而无不及，极具神奇色彩。
    除了每天一两小时练琴自娱，马晓春的业余时间便多用于伏案撰文。也许，不久之后，人们就可看到他的第一本著述问世。
    在这本尚未脱稿，版权已为蜀蓉出版社预定的棋书中，马晓春独出心裁，想对古今围棋韬略来个大综合，然后按照“三十六计”的思路，分门别类，为后来学棋者旁开入门之道。
    大约3年前，他和队友汪见虹开始了这标新立异之作。
    前几天，我向他寻问此书进展，马晓春淡淡一笑道：“已写完三十一计，约15万字，不过剩下的都是硬骨头，像指桑骂槐，装疯作痴之类，又得另寻下笔处了。”
