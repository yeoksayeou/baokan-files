The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed that we must continue to firmly implement the policy of rectification and reform, and emphasized that during the period of rectification and reform, reform should revolve around rectification and reform, serving the purpose of rectification and reform.

This policy and guiding ideology are being increasingly understood and implemented in practice by more people. However, some people lack a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between rectification and reform, even opposing the two, and thus lack determination and are slow in taking action in rectification and reform.

Therefore, we must deeply understand and widely publicize the consistency between rectification and reform.

The consistency between the two lies first in their fundamental goals. Why do we need reform? Ultimately, it is to promote the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of China's national economy. This is also the fundamental criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of reform and whether reform measures are appropriate. Why do we need rectification and reform? Ultimately, it is also to promote and ensure the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of China's national economy. Facing the economic overheating and serious economic imbalances of recent years, how can we achieve this goal without rectification and reform? Someone made a vivid analogy: farmers growing cotton need to water and fertilize it to promote growth, but they also need to prune and shape it to prevent excessive and useless growth. Both are aimed at achieving high yield, and no one would oppose the two. The relationship between rectification and reform is similar, isn't it?

We must also see that the deepening of reform is closely related to the economic environment. Ten years of reform practice has shown that not only is it impossible for a single aspect of reform to advance alone, but overall reform and specific reform measures are also constrained by the economic environment. For example, severe inflation will inevitably bring great difficulties to price reform. Shortages of energy and raw materials cannot help but affect the development of the production materials market. And so on. Due to the influence of the economic environment, even correct reform measures may change. In this sense, rectification and reform are precisely to create and improve the objective conditions for deepening reform, and their consistency is obvious.

Moreover, over the past 10 years, we have carried out some reforms in various economic fields, and overall, we have achieved remarkable results. However, in terms of specific reform measures, it is also necessary to summarize experiences and lessons from reality, and do a good job of connecting, matching, improving, and adjusting, so that reform measures can achieve better results. During the period of rectification and reform, the central authorities emphasize the need to maintain the stability of the basic policies of reform and opening up. This fundamentally consolidates and protects the achievements of reform. The so-called deepening of reform mainly has two manifestations: one is the introduction of new reform measures, and the other is the deepening and improvement of existing reform measures to achieve results. During the period of rectification and reform, the deepening of reform mainly takes the latter form, which cannot be said to be not reform, nor can it be said to be a "retreat." For example, in enterprise reform, even if no new measures are introduced, adhering to and improving the contract responsibility system, and making the contract responsibility system play a better role, is an important manifestation of deepening reform. Reform must both activate the micro-economy and strengthen comprehensive balance and macro-control. During the period of rectification and reform, while continuing to activate the micro-economy, we must improve market order, implement appropriate concentration, and establish a macro-control system that promotes stable economic development. This is not only the need for rectification and reform but also the need for the coordinated development of reform.

Of course, during the process of rectification and reform, we must pay attention to adhering to the basic policies of reform and opening up, and must pay attention to maintaining the continuity and stability of policies, and strive to solve complex problems with practical and appropriate methods, and constantly pay attention to new situations and solve new problems. These are all points that the central authorities have repeatedly emphasized.

Based on the above main reasons, we say that rectification and reform are consistent; it is also based on these reasons that we say that being unenthusiastic about rectification and reform is being unenthusiastic about reform. The purpose is simply to help everyone understand the situation, dispel doubts, and boost morale to fully complete the various tasks proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

    治理整顿是为改革开放创造更好的条件
    本报评论员
    党的十三届五中全会提出，要继续坚定不移地贯彻执行治理整顿、深化改革的方针，并强调，在治理整顿期间，改革要围绕治理整顿进行，为治理整顿服务。
    这一方针和指导思想，正为越来越多的人理解，并在实践中贯彻执行。但也有一些人对治理整顿和深化改革的关系缺乏全面的认识，甚至把两者对立起来，因而在治理整顿方面决心不大，动作迟缓。
    为此，我们必须深刻认识和广泛宣传治理整顿和深化改革的一致性。
    两者的一致性，首先在于它们根本目的是一致的。为什么要改革？说到底，就是为了促进我国国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展。这也是检验改革成效、检验改革措施是否妥当的根本标准。为什么要治理整顿？说到底，也是为了促进和保证我国国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。面对着近年来的经济过热和经济比例严重失调的情况，不治理、不整顿，我们怎能达到这个目的呢？有人做了这样一个形象的比喻，农民种棉花，一方面要浇水施肥，促其成长；一方面又要打顶整枝，防其疯长和徒长。两者都是为了达到丰产的目的，谁也不会把两者对立起来。治理整顿、深化改革之间的关系，不也存在着类似的道理吗？
    还要看到，改革的深化又是与经济环境密切相关的。10年改革的实践说明，不仅某一方面的改革不可能孤军深入，而且整体改革以及某一项改革措施，都要受到经济环境的制约。例如，严重的通货膨胀，必然给价格改革带来很大的困难。能源、原材料的短缺，不能不影响到生产资料市场的发育程度。如此等等。由于经济环境的作用，甚至可能使本来正确的改革措施也变了样。从这种意义上说，治理整顿正是为深化改革创造和改善客观条件，两者的一致性也是显然的。
    再者，10年来，我们在各个经济领域都进行了一些改革，总体来说取得了显著成果。但是，就具体的改革措施来说，也需要从实际出发总结经验教训，做好衔接、配套、完善、调整工作，以求改革措施获得更好的实效。在治理整顿期间，中央强调要保持改革、开放各项基本政策的稳定性。这就从根本上巩固和保护了改革的成果。所谓深化改革，主要有两种表现形式：一种是有新的改革措施出台，一种是深化和完善已有的改革措施抓出实效。在治理整顿期间，深化改革主要表现为后一种形式，这不能说不是改革，更不能说是“倒退”。例如，在企业改革方面，即使不出台新的措施，坚持承包制、完善承包制，使承包制更好地发挥效用，就是深化改革的重要体现。改革既要搞活微观经济，又要加强综合平衡和宏观调控。在治理整顿期间，要在继续搞活微观经济的同时，健全市场秩序，实行适当集中，建立能够促进经济稳定发展的宏观调控体系，这不仅是治理整顿的需要，也是改革配套发展的需要。
    当然，在治理整顿过程中，必须注意坚持改革、开放的基本政策，必须注意保持政策的连续性、稳定性，力求用切实的、妥善的方法解决复杂的问题，不断注意新情况，解决新问题。这些，都是中央一再强调的。
    基于上述主要理由，我们说治理整顿和深化改革是一致的；也正是基于这些理由，我们说对治理整顿不积极就是对改革不积极。其目的无非是要大家认清形势，解除顾虑，振作精神，全面完成党的十三届五中全会提出的各项任务。
