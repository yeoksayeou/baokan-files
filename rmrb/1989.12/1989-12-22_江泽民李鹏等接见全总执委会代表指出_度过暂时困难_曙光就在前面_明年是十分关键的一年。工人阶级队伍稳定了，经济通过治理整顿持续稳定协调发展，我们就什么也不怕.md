Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, and Ding Guan'gen and other central leaders warmly received all representatives attending the 11th session of the 2nd Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at the Great Hall of the People this evening. Jiang Zemin emphasized in his speech that the working class is the main force in socialist revolution and construction, and in the current rectification and deepening of reform, we must still rely wholeheartedly on the working class.

Jiang Zemin said, the trade union is the organization of the working masses. Currently, the trade union is implementing the spirit of the 4th and 5th Plenary Sessions of the 13th Central Committee, and should tell the working masses that the difficulties and problems currently appearing in economic life are accumulated over many years, and the necessity and arduousness of rectification and adjustment should be deeply understood. The Party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about the broad masses of workers. The rectification and economic adjustment will bring some temporary difficulties to the lives of some workers, and some problems are being solved. Next year is a crucial year. If the working class is stable, and China's economy, through rectification and adjustment, achieves continuous, stable, and coordinated development, we will fear nothing. Overcoming temporary difficulties, the dawn is just ahead.

Premier Li Peng pointed out in his speech that the foundation of political stability is the economy, and the stability of the economy relies on enterprises. The current economic difficulties are temporary, and the difficulties faced by enterprises due to market changes are also temporary. These difficulties also provide an opportunity for enterprises to deepen reform, improve economic benefits, and explore new development paths. He said, our government is the people's government. All levels of government should actively listen to, respect, and adopt the correct opinions proposed by trade unions at all levels. The work of the government also needs the supervision of trade unions. The Chinese working class under the leadership of the Communist Party has been tested over a long period. I hope everyone will work together to get the economy going.

Song Ping said, on the one hand, we should pay attention to the current temporary difficulties, and on the other hand, we should have confidence to overcome them. The Chinese working class is a powerful force of 130 million people, a force that is particularly capable of fighting. The difficulties we are facing now will definitely be overcome. In the process of economic adjustment, the income of some workers in some enterprises may be affected. The Party and the government care about them, and the State Council has made arrangements. Trade unions should cooperate to do a good job. He said, the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the working class. The fighting power of the Communist Party comes from the working class and the masses. The fate of the working class is linked with socialism and with the Communist Party. If someone tries to oppose socialism and attack the Communist Party of China, the working class will definitely stand up and fight resolutely against them.

The speeches of the central leaders were frequently interrupted by warm applause. Ni Zhifu said that he would definitely study and understand the spirit of the speeches by the central leaders, unite all workers across the country closely around the Party Central Committee, and make greater contributions to rectification and deepening of reform.

    江泽民李鹏等接见全总执委会代表指出
    度过暂时困难  曙光就在前面
    明年是十分关键的一年。工人阶级队伍稳定了，经济通过治理整顿持续稳定协调发展，我们就什么也不怕
    新华社北京12月21日电　（记者朱幼棣）江泽民、李鹏、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、丁关根等中央领导同志今晚在人民大会堂亲切接见了参加全国总工会十一届二次执委会的全体代表。江泽民同志在讲话时强调，工人阶级是社会主义革命和建设的主力军，在当前治理整顿和深化改革中，同样要全心全意依靠工人阶级。
    江泽民说，工会是工人群众自己的组织。目前工会正在贯彻党的十三届四中全会、五中全会精神，要告诉工人群众，当前经济生活中出现的一些困难和问题，是多年积累下来的，要深刻理解治理整顿的必要性和艰巨性。党中央和国务院非常关心广大工人群众，进行治理整顿和经济调整，会给一些职工生活带来某些暂时的困难，一些问题我们正在设法解决。明年是十分关键的一年，工人阶级的队伍稳定了，我国经济通过治理整顿得到了持续、稳定、协调的发展，我们就什么也不怕。度过暂时困难，曙光就在前面。
    李鹏总理在讲话中指出，政治稳定的基础是经济，经济稳定要靠企业。当前经济上的某些困难是暂时的，企业因市场出现的变化带来的困难也是暂时的，这些困难也给企业通过深化改革、提高经济效益、探索新的发展道路提供了一个好机会。他说，我们的政府是人民的政府，各级政府应当积极听取、尊重和采纳各级工会提出的正确意见，政府工作也需要工会的监督。共产党领导下的中国工人阶级是经过长期考验的，希望大家同心同德，把经济搞上去。
    宋平说，对待目前出现的一些暂时困难，一方面要重视，另一方面要有信心克服它。中国工人阶级是一支拥有一亿三千万人的强大队伍，是一支特别能战斗的队伍。眼前遇到的这些困难一定能够克服。在经济调整中部分企业的职工收入可能受到一些影响，党和政府是关心他们的，国务院已经作了安排，工会要配合做好工作。他说，中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，共产党的战斗力来源于工人阶级和人民群众。工人阶级的命运是和社会主义、是和共产党联系在一起的，如果有人妄图反对社会主义，攻击中国共产党，工人阶级一定要起来和他们作坚决的斗争。
    中央领导同志的讲话不时被热烈掌声打断。倪志福表示，一定认真学习领会和贯彻好中央领导同志讲话精神，把全国职工紧密团结在党中央周围，为治理整顿和深化改革作出更大贡献。
