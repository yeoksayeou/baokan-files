This year, many provinces and autonomous regions across the country experienced less rainfall during the flood season, leading to reduced water storage in rivers and reservoirs. Water sources for spring irrigation will be particularly scarce. In response, various drought-affected provinces have adopted the following strategies for winter agricultural water conservancy construction: winter anti-drought measures to ensure water sources for the coming year's harvest.

According to preliminary statistics, by the end of October, more than a million water conservancy projects of various types had been initiated nationwide. These projects have newly increased, restored, and improved the irrigation area by over 8 million mu (approximately 533,333 hectares), an increase of 60% compared to the same period last year. Simultaneously, various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have formulated scientific and planned water use schemes, implementing water allocation and quota management. They are vigorously promoting water-saving irrigation systems and technologies to reduce water consumption and improve water use efficiency. Shandong Province, which has been severely affected by drought, aims to launch a large-scale anti-drought water conservancy construction campaign across the province. The provincial government has decided to increase the funds allocated for agricultural water conservancy construction to 3.15 billion yuan for the winter and spring of this year. Every effort will be made to build water conservancy projects to ensure a bountiful harvest despite the drought.

    各地农田水利建设新对策
    春旱冬抗确保水源
    本报讯　今年全国许多省区汛期少雨，河道、水库蓄水减少，明春农田灌溉水源将十分紧缺。受旱各省在今冬农田水利建设中相应的对策是：春旱冬抗，为确保来年丰收创造水源条件。
    据初步统计，到10月底，全国动工兴修各类水源工程上百万项，新增、恢复、改善灌溉面积800多万亩，比去年同期增加60％。同时，各省市区普遍制定科学用水、计划用水方案，实行水量预分，包干用水；大力推行节水型灌溉制度及灌水技术，降低用水量，提高水的利用率。遭受严重干旱的山东省，为在全省掀起一个大规模抗旱治水的农田水利建设热潮，省政府决定今冬明春省市县用于农田水利建设资金要增加到3.15亿元，千方百计建设水源工程，保证抗旱夺丰收。
