Aircraft tire valve cores, developed by the Shenyang Third Rubber Factory, have reached world-advanced levels after successful trials. The product, after being appraised by relevant departments, can save the country over $1 million in foreign exchange annually.

The aircraft tire valve core is small but has a complex structure and high production difficulty. Experts from the military representative office of the Shenyang Third Rubber Factory have spent two years researching and finally succeeded in developing the product. This not only replaces a large number of imports but also extends the service life of aircraft tires, ensuring flight safety.
