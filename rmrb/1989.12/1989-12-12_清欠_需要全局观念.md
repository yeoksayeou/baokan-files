	Clearing the “debt chain” is a good thing, but the phenomenon of “clearing debts in the front while owing in the back” is worrying. The reason is that departmental and local interests are at play. Therefore—

	“Clearing Debts Requires a Holistic Perspective”

	“This is truly a timely rain!” No one expected that when the news of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China assisting enterprises in clearing debts was released, it would receive such enthusiastic cheers. Many factory managers, directors, mayors, and governors hope that the bank will continue to do this “good deed.” (1)

	However, while various sectors are cheering for the bank's “wise move,” the information returning from various places is worrying.

	At the end of June, Tianjin's enterprises owed 5.2 billion yuan. After more than four months of clearing, 3.93 billion yuan of the “debt chain” was untangled. The achievements are not small. But by mid-November, at least 4 billion yuan of new debts had accumulated.

	In September, Hubei Province's enterprises owed 7.3 billion yuan in goods payments. In October, the entire province mobilized to help enterprises clear 1 billion yuan in overdue payments. However, by the end of October, the “debt chain” not only did not decrease but increased to 7.5 billion yuan.

	The situation in Jiangxi Province is even more intriguing. In March of this year, the province's enterprises owed 1.6 billion yuan. Over the past six months, the province has cleared debts nine times internally and twice inter-provincially, totaling 1.9 billion yuan. But now, the enterprises' demand for clearing debts is still rising.

	The estimate by experts from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China seems not to be exaggerated: by the end of March, the national enterprises owed approximately 100 billion yuan. After the bank assisted enterprises in clearing 55 billion yuan, the amount of mutual debts among enterprises today will still not be less than 100 billion yuan.

	The phenomenon of owing—clearing—owing again that has occurred in the past few months in economic life has prompted people to think about a question: is there intentional owing in the newly increased debts? (2)

	Unfortunately, the facts speak for themselves.

	Through the confusing “clearing in the front and owing in the back” phenomenon, one can see some places and departments, out of local and departmental interests, setting up numerous obstacles for the “clearing debts” work. “Owing” money can be delayed as much as possible, and can be owed as much as possible. This is one of the obstacles. A certain province in Southwest China has a relatively “developed” tobacco industry, which consumes a large amount of tobacco leaves from neighboring provinces every year. However, this province recently stipulated that all tobacco leaf debts from outside the province will not be paid. Another grain-importing province is even more extreme, not only does it not thank the brother provinces for their support, but it also wants to take the “free meal” route—eating grain without paying money. Currently, this province owes grain debts to five or six provinces and regions.

	In contrast to not paying debts owed to others, some regions give every possible support to those enterprises within the region that do not comply with the national industrial policy and have products that are not selling well.

	A cigarette factory owed 300 million yuan at the end of August, and the bank helped clear 280 million yuan. However, by early November, the overdue amount had increased to 600 million yuan, doubling. Why? Although the factory's cigarettes are not selling well, it is a major tax-paying enterprise for the local government. Therefore, the local government today asks the bank to clear, and tomorrow asks the bank to clear. As a result, the bank clears in the front, and the cigarette factory continues to produce and ship in large quantities in the back, making the cleared amount less than the owed amount.

	Local governments act for their own interests like this, and departments act for their own interests as well.

	Not long ago, the state, in response to the “pseudo-surplus” situation in the domestic market, to relieve the urgent needs of production enterprises and ensure the supply for next year, required local commercial departments to purchase more durable consumer goods and necessities such as color TVs, to play the role of a “reservoir.” However, many local commercial departments, fearing to occupy funds, refused to purchase with various reasons.

	A certain place has 100,000 color TVs in industrial stock. The local bank, in a situation of tight funds, specially lent 420 million yuan to the local power supply company. Unexpectedly, after this company reluctantly purchased 12,000 color TVs, it stated that it would definitely not purchase any more.

	A certain province's commercial sector should have purchased 110,000 color TVs according to the plan. However, in reality, not only did it not purchase color TVs according to the plan, but it did not even want to purchase other goods normally. To the extent that in the peak season for purchasing and storing goods in October, the local commercial loans in this province actually decreased by 6% compared to the beginning of the year. (3)

	The widespread existence of the “debt chain” among enterprises is suffocating many enterprises and seriously disrupting the normal economic order. How to help enterprises untangle the “debt chain”? How to create a social environment for enterprises to clear and prevent debts has become an important issue facing governments at all levels.

	Someone suggested: For those enterprises that do not comply with the national industrial policy, operate poorly, incur losses year after year, and have poor product quality, they should be resolute in closing down and restructuring. At the same time, further improve economic regulations, and for the behavior of enterprises refusing to pay for goods and intentionally occupying others' funds, in addition to compensating for the economic losses caused to the other party, legal responsibility should also be pursued.

	These suggestions will undoubtedly have a “radical” effect. But even if the “prescription” is good, the “patient” still needs to be willing to “take” it. Macroeconomic adjustments inevitably conflict with local interests to some extent. But it must also be seen that local interests and overall interests are interdependent. If everyone starts from localism, either dragging others' goods debts without clearing them, or protecting their own industries and products that should be adjusted, it seems to have gained an advantage. However, the economic chaos caused by this will eventually lead to both oneself and the country suffering losses.

### “清欠”需要全局观念

    清除“债务链”是好事，但“前清后欠”的现象却又令人不安。原因是，部门利益、地方利益在作怪。因此——
    “清欠”需要全局观念
    本报记者　潘岗
      “这真是一场及时雨！”谁也没有料到，当中国工商银行协助企业“清欠”的消息传出，竟博得如此热烈的欢呼声。许多厂长、经理、市长，省长，盼望银行把这等“好事”做到底。（一）
    然而，就在各界为银行的“有识之举”欢呼之时，各地返回的信息却令人不安。
    6月末，天津市企业拖欠52亿元，经过四个多月的清理，解开了39.3亿元“债务链”，按说成绩不小。但到11月中旬，至少又有40亿元新欠。
    湖北省9月底企业拖欠货款73亿元。10月份，全省上下齐动员，一举帮助企业清理拖欠近10亿元。可到10月底统计，“债务链”不仅未少，反而增加到75亿元。
    江西省的情况更令人寻味。今年3月，全省企业拖欠16亿元。半年多来，省内连续清了9次，省际又清了2次，累计清了19亿元。但眼下企业要求清欠的呼声，依然一浪高过一浪。
    中国工商银行有关专家的估计似乎并非耸人听闻：3月底全国企业拖欠约千亿元，在工商银行协助企业累计清了550亿元后的今天，企业间互相拖欠额仍然不会少于千亿。
    拖欠——清理——再拖欠，近几个月来经济生活中出现的这种反常现象促使人们思考一个问题，在新增的拖欠中，是不是存在故意拖欠？（二）
    事实不幸而言中。
    透过扑朔迷离的“前清后欠”现象，可窥见一些地方和部门出于地方利益、部门利益，而为“清欠”工作设置的重重障碍。“欠人”款能拖就拖，能欠就欠。这是障碍之一。西南某省烟草工业尚属“发达”，每年要“吃”邻省大量烟叶，可这个省前不久规定：省外烟叶欠款一律不付。另一个粮食调入省更“绝”，不仅不感谢兄弟省的支援，反而想走“白吃”路——吃粮不给钱。目前，这个省欠下五六个省区的粮款。
    与欠人货款不还形成对比的是，一些地区对区内那些不符国家产业政策、产品滞销的企业，千方百计给“偏饭”吃。
    有个卷烟厂8月底人欠3000万元，银行帮助清了2800万元，可到11月初，拖欠又增加到6000万元，翻了一番。原因何在？该厂卷烟虽销售不畅，却是地方利税大户，于是，当地政府今天让银行清，明天让银行清，结果银行前面清，烟厂后面继续大量生产、发货，使清的没有欠的多。
    地方为了自己利益如此，部门为了自己利益亦同。
    前不久，国家针对国内市场出现“假过剩”情况，为解生产企业之急，保证来年市场供应，要求各地商业部门多购进一些彩电等耐用消费品和生活必需品，以发挥“蓄水池”作用，但不少地区商业部门怕占压资金，以种种理由拒绝收购。
    某地工业积压彩电10多万台，当地银行在资金紧张的情况下，专门将4200万元贷款送到该地区交电公司。不想这家公司勉强购进1.2万台彩电后，就表示坚决不再收购了。
    某省商业按计划应收购彩电11万台。可实际上不仅远未按计划收购彩电，甚至连其它商品也不愿正常购进。以至在采购储存商品旺季的10月份，这个省地方商业贷款反而比年初下降6％。（三）
    企业“债务链”的普遍存在，压得许多企业喘不过气来，也严重干扰了正常的经济秩序。如何帮助企业解开“债务链”？如何给企业创造出一个清欠、防欠的社会环境，已成为摆在各级政府面前的重要问题。
    有人建议：对那些不符国家产业政策、经营不善、连年亏损、产品质量低劣的企业，要下决心关停并转。同时，进一步完善经济法规，对企业间存在的拒付货款、有意占用他方资金等行为，除了要赔偿给对方造成的经济损失外，还应追究法律责任。
    这些建议无疑会收“治本”之效。但“药方”虽好，还得“病人”乐意“吃”。宏观调整难免会与局部利益产生一些摩擦。但也要看到，局部利益与整体利益唇齿相依。假如都从本位主义出发，或拖着他人的货款不清，或护着自己该调整的产业、产品不予调整，好像占了便宜，情不知由此引起的经济紊乱，到头来不仅自己吃亏，国家也吃亏。
