After more than a year of safe operation, the national key project of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" – the Heng-Guang Railway Second Line – passed the national acceptance inspection today and will be handed over to the Guangzhou Railway Bureau for use starting January 1 next year.

The Heng-Guang Railway Second Line, which was built with an investment of 3.2 billion yuan by the state, is 526 kilometers long. It was completed in November last year and has been in operation for a year with no major accidents. The world's tenth-largest double-track railway tunnel, the Dayao Mountain Tunnel, located in the middle of the second line, has been running smoothly. Li Senmao, the Minister of Railways, who attended today's acceptance meeting, said that this second line meets the design standards of a first-class national trunk railway, has relatively advanced operational technology and equipment, and has excellent design and construction quality, basically meeting the current demand for transportation volume.
