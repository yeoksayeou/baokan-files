    I remember it was a morning after a light rain, I walked through a street adorned with silver birch trees, and arrived at the flower market on Jingxing Street. Jingxing Street is a small east-west street in Kunming City. From early morning to evening, from early spring to late winter, flowers, flower pots, fertilizer, and soil are sold here, as well as birds like the painted quail and goldfish. I strolled among the flowers. As more people started to grow flowers, the prices went up. I inquired a few times, and the price of azalea seedlings was around three yuan each. Three yuan it is, as long as they can be grown. I was about to take out my wallet when I suddenly noticed a neat row of azalea seedlings in the basket to the left of the seller.

    I squatted down to take a look. They were all of the same height, with sturdy stems and lush leaves, exuding vigorous life force.

    “Are you buying azaleas?” came a crisp voice in the Kunming dialect. “Yes,” I replied, looking up.

    This was a girl of about fourteen or fifteen, with an oval face, almond-shaped eyes, dark skin, and rough hands—nature’s bounty and hard work combined. The girl fiddled with the seedlings and picked out one, gently unwrapping the plastic covering the roots: “Take a look at this one.”

    This azalea had a stem as thick as a little finger, plump leaves, and especially well-protected roots. The fine red blood vessels stretched out in the black skin.

    “How much?” I asked. “Five jiao.” “So cheap!” I blurted out words that didn’t match my status as a buyer. The girl rewrapped the plastic covering the roots with water-soaked straw. I picked up the seedling to leave, but the girl stopped me: “Wait, I’ll get you some soil.”

    “Soil?” I asked. “Ayi, quickly get some soil for the customer,” the girl selling flowers said, nudging the younger girl who was dozing off in the basket behind her.

    “How much?” I asked. “…This soil, you want money for it too!” The younger girl giggled, revealing a set of clean, even teeth. “Original flower, original soil, it will grow well,” the elder sister said.

    It turned out that their family lived in a mountain village about 30 kilometers away from Kunming. They had dug up the azalea seedlings from the mountain the previous evening and taken a bus into the city early in the morning.

    “Others dig up the seedlings a day or two earlier, but we’re afraid they won’t grow well if they’re kept too long,” the elder sister told me, her expression calm. As I left, I bought another azalea seedling.

    I left Kunming for Beijing more than four years ago, but whenever I see the two azaleas in the pot, blooming red and green, I think of the flower market on Jingxing Street and the two sisters selling azaleas.

    杜鹃姐妹
    郑健
    记得是个小雨初霁的清晨，我穿过银桦挂珠的大街，到了景星街花市。景星街是昆明市一条东西向的小街，从清晨到傍晚，从初春到深冬，这里卖花，卖花盆，卖花肥、花土，也卖画眉、金鱼。我在花间徜徉。养花的人多了，花价高了，问了几次，杜鹃株价都在三块左右。三块就三块吧，只要能种活。我正要掏钱包，忽见左首卖主的箩筐前，整整齐齐摆了一溜儿的杜鹃苗。蹲下一看，一样的高，一样的杆粗叶润，透出旺盛的生命力。
    “您基要买杜鹃吗？”脆生生的昆明郊区话。“是。”我抬起头。
    这是位十四五岁的姑娘，瓜子脸，杏仁眼，黝黑的皮肤，粗糙的双手——好天候、好水土养育与辛勤劳作的复合。姑娘拨弄了几下，挑出一棵，轻轻地把包花根的塑料布解开：“您基瞧瞧这棵。”这株杜鹃，杆粗似小拇指，叶子肥厚，尤其那根须保护得极好，一条条红色的毛细血管，在黑色的肌肤里伸展。
    “多少钱？”我问。“五毛。”“这么便宜！”我竟脱口道出与买主身份不符的话。姑娘用浸泡过水的稻草，把包花根的塑料布重新捆上。我拿起花苗要走，被姑娘叫住了：“等等，给您基花土。”
    “花土？”“阿妹，快给人家舀花土。”卖花的姑娘踅身，推了一下伏在身后箩筐上打盹儿的姑娘。
    “多少钱？”我问。“……这土，还要钱呀！”阿妹咯咯笑了，露出一口洁白整齐的牙齿。“原花原土，好活。”那姐姐说。
    原来，她们家住在离昆明30多公里远的一个山村里，昨天傍晚把杜鹃苗从山里挖来，今天凌晨搭汽车进城的。
    “其他人都是早一两天把花苗挖回来，我们怕隔长了人家买去不好活。”那当姐姐的对我说，神情淡淡的。临走，我又买了一株杜鹃。
    我离开昆明到北京四年多了，每当看到盆中那两株花红叶绿的杜鹃，就会想起景星街花市，想起卖杜鹃的姐妹俩。
