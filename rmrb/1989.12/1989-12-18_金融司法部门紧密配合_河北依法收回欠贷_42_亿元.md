Financial and judicial departments in Hebei Province have closely collaborated to enforce loan recovery, achieving remarkable results. Statistics show that from January to November this year, the province has recovered 4.26 billion yuan in overdue and non-performing loans.

Investigations reveal that due to issues such as product backlog, inter-enterprise arrears, and delayed loan repayments, the total amount of overdue and non-performing loans in the province has reached 9.28 billion yuan. This has seriously affected normal production and the healthy circulation of credit funds. In April, the Hebei Higher People's Court and the Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China decided to enforce loan recovery in accordance with the law, implementing several measures.

Firstly, financial regulations were established to motivate both borrowers and lenders. For villages with an average income exceeding 200 yuan, those who voluntarily repay their loans within the specified period can receive a 20-40% interest reduction. For villages with an average income of 200 yuan or less, the reduction can be 50-80%. Secondly, a trial of linking loan issuance and recovery was conducted. Banks prioritize issuing new loans to enterprises that actively repay their loans, while limiting loans to those that are passive. Thirdly, rewards were given to those who contributed to the recovery of overdue loans.

Secondly, different legal and policy measures were adopted based on various situations. For example, borrowers with repayment capacity were ordered to settle their debts in full. Those with partial repayment capacity could repay in installments. For those temporarily unable to repay, plans were made to defer repayment. For illegal operators and speculators, compulsory repayment measures were enforced.

    河北依法收回欠贷42亿元
    本报石家庄12月17日电  记者陈国琦报道：河北省金融司法部门紧密配合，依法收贷，取得显著成果。据统计，今年1月至11月，全省收回到逾期贷款和呆滞贷款42.6亿元。
    调查表明，由于产品积压、企业相互拖欠和还贷不及时等原因，全省到逾期及呆滞贷款总额已达92.8亿元，严重影响了正常的生产及信贷资金的良性循环。今年4月，省高级法院和省人民银行作出依法收贷的决定，采取了几项措施。
    ——制定金融法规，调动还贷和收贷两方面的积极性。一是运用利息杠杆促使欠贷者还贷。对人均收入超过200元的村，在规定期限内主动还贷者，可减息20—40％；人均收入200元以下的村，可减息50—80％。二是试行收放挂钩。银行对还贷积极的企业，优先发放新贷款，对消极者则限贷。三是奖励清收欠贷有贡献者。
    ——根据不同情况，采取相应的法律和政策。如对有偿还能力的欠贷户，令其一次还清。有部分偿还能力者，可分期分批偿还。对暂时没有还贷能力者，帮其作出还贷计划，缓期偿还。对非法经营、投机倒把者，则强制其还贷。
