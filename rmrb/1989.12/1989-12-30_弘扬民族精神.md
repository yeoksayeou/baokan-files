Edition: 6

As 1989 comes to a close, with the ringing of the New Year's bell, we will step into the first year of the 1990s.

In the past year, cadres and the masses from various sectors have worked diligently at their posts, striving to contribute to the development of the national economy and social stability. We pay our highest respects to these unsung heroes!

In the past year, the readers' letters section of this newspaper has received enthusiastic support and attention from various levels of party and government agencies and a wide range of readers. On this occasion, we express our heartfelt thanks to them! At the same time, we hope that in the new year, we will continue to receive everyone's support and assistance to make this readers' forum even better.

China has undergone significant changes in the 1980s. The Eastern giant, which had been dormant for many years and endured hardships, has finally taken flight to catch up with the wheels of history. The achievements of the past ten years indisputably prove that the basic line established by the Party Central Committee—focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and promoting reform and opening up—is correct. The twists and turns of the past ten years also prove that to correctly implement the Party's basic line, we must oppose bourgeois liberalization and other erroneous trends, oppose all illegal and disorderly behavior, and boost national spirit and the socialist enthusiasm of the entire people. Therefore, those fighting on various fronts should carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese nation, work hard, build the country with thrift, forge ahead, and make selfless contributions. In the 1990s, the world will develop even more rapidly, and China will have greater development on the socialist path. The task is heavy, and the road is long. Every Chinese person with dignity will not lag behind. We, the readers' letters section, are willing to work with the broad readership to uphold the national spirit.

    弘扬民族精神
    一九八九年即将过去，随着新年的钟声，我们将跨入九十年代的第一年。
    在过去的一年里，各行各业的干部、群众，在各自的工作岗位上辛勤劳动，努力工作，默默奉献，为国民经济的发展和社会的稳定作出了巨大贡献。在此，我们向这些无名英雄们致以崇高的敬意！
    在过去的一年里，本报读者来信版得到了各级党政机关和广大读者的热情支持和关心。值此机会，我们向他们表示衷心的感谢！同时也期望在新的一年里，继续得到大家的支持和帮助，把这块读者自己的园地办得更好。
    八十年代的中国发生了显著的变化，沉睡了多年又历经磨难的东方巨龙终于腾飞起来，去追赶历史的车轮。十年的成果无可辩驳地证明，党中央确立的坚持以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的基本路线是多么正确。十年来所走过的曲折道路也证明，党的基本路线要正确地贯彻，必须反对资产阶级自由化等错误思潮，必须反对一切违法乱纪行为，必须振奋民族精神、调动全体人民的社会主义积极性。因此，战斗在各条战线上的人们应发扬中华民族的优良传统，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，开拓进取，无私奉献。九十年代，世界的发展将更加日新月异，中国在社会主义道路上将要有更大的发展。任重而道远。每一个有骨气的中国人都不会甘居人后。我们读者来信版愿和广大读者一起，为弘扬民族精神而努力。
