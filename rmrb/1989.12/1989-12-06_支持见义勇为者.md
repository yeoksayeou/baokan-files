In our society, righteousness should prevail over evil. Where there is evil, there should be righteousness to resist it. The reason why Comrade Yang Qike has been praised by people is that, when a group of apprentices were in trouble, he wrote a letter of complaint under pressure, which drew the attention of the leaders of the State Council and the local government, and finally justice was served. This shows that in the struggle against corruption, rectifying improper tendencies, and opposing bad practices, the Party, the government, and the broad masses of the people hope to see more and more people who dare to speak out, stand up for justice, and uphold righteousness.

There are often injustices. It is precisely in solving these injustices that we move forward. Now, when people talk about evil winds and bad people and deeds, they are often indignant, even gnashing their teeth. But when they actually encounter such injustices, whether they dare to stand up and take action, there will be various situations. The value of those who stand up for justice lies in their sense of justice and conscience. Those who do evil (including those who are involved in evil deeds) fear and hate them the most. Therefore, those who stand up for justice may encounter unexpected disasters: being criticized, suppressed, and retaliated against. Therefore, we must strongly support those who stand up for justice. When they are fighting, we must give them encouragement and help as much as possible; when they encounter pressure or setbacks, we must try to eliminate it and protect their rights and interests. Local governments, in particular, must pay attention to this issue. Comrade Yang Qike's letter of complaint was fortunately endorsed by the leaders of the State Council, which quickly resolved the problem. But the daily large number of exposure letters still need to be handled by governments at all levels. As long as all levels of government pay attention to and protect the enthusiasm of the masses in fighting against lawlessness and disorder, there will be more and more people who stand up for justice, and social customs will be better and better.

    支持见义勇为者
    在我们的社会里，应该邪不胜正。哪里有邪气，哪里就应有正气予以抵制。杨启科同志之所以能受到人们的赞扬，是因为正当一批徒工受难时，他顶着压力，奋笔疾书上告，引起了国务院领导同志和当地政府的重视，终于使正义得到了伸张。由此可以看出，在惩治腐败、纠正不正之风、反对不良现象的斗争中，党、政府和广大群众多么希望出现更多更多的仗义执言、见义勇为、树立正气的人。
    “不平”之事经常有。我们正是在不断解决这些“不平”事中前进。现在，人们一谈起歪风邪气、坏人坏事来，多是群情激愤，甚至咬牙切齿。可一旦果真碰到这类不平事，敢不敢拍案而起，挺身而出，却会出现各种情况。那些见义勇为者的可贵之处，在于他们富有正义感和做人的良知，干坏事的人（包括一些与坏事有牵连的人）最怕、最恨的也是他们。这样，对见义勇为者来说，就有可能招致意想不到的横祸：被非议，受打击，遭报复。因此，我们要对那些见义勇为者给予大力支持。当他们在斗争时，要给鼓气，尽力帮助；当他们遇到压力或挫折时，要设法给予排除，保护他们的权益，各级政府尤其要重视这个问题。杨启科同志的控告信幸由国务院领导同志作了批示后，使问题很快得到解决。但日常大量的揭发信件，还要靠各级政府查处。只要各地重视和保护群众同违法乱纪进行斗争的积极性，见义勇为者就会越来越多，社会风气也就会越来越好。
