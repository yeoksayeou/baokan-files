A series of key construction projects, with a cumulative national investment of over 1.3 billion yuan, are currently under rapid construction in the Tibetan plateau.

These key projects include the expansion of Lhasa Gonggar Airport, the Yangzhuoyong Lake pumped storage power station, the reconstruction of the China-Nepal Highway and the Heichang Highway, the renovation of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and the third phase of the Yangbajing Geothermal Power Station. Additionally, there are supporting projects for the World Food Programme's 3357 project and the construction of 11 commodity grain and livestock base counties. Other projects include the renovation of the old city area of Lhasa, the repair of the Potala Palace, and the development of the Lubusha chromite iron mine.

Relevant officials informed the reporter that these key projects are crucial for the national economy and people's livelihood. The expansion of Gonggar Airport, with nearly 200 million yuan in national investment, is progressing rapidly. The earthwork for the runway and taxiway has completed 71% of the design, and the concrete foundation for the new 4,000-meter runway is being poured. This will be the longest runway in southwestern China, and it is expected to be operational by the end of next year. The construction of communication and navigation facilities, passenger terminal buildings, and other ancillary structures will also commence soon. After the expansion, Lhasa Gonggar Airport will be the highest modern airport in the world.

The Lhasa to Zhangmu border China-Nepal Highway, known as the "Friendship Highway" by the people of both China and Nepal, is also a vital route connecting the front and rear parts of Tibet. This project, initiated in 1986, is expected to be completed by the end of next year. Currently, 70 kilometers of asphalt road have been completed, and the Nimu Bridge and Renbu Bridge have been constructed. The third bridge across the Yarlung Zangbo River, the Tuduo Bridge, has had its piers erected, eliminating the need for farmers in the Dazhuka area to worry about river crossings.

The Sichuan-Tibet Highway is Tibet's second "lifeline." The middle section, affected by the rainy season, experiences annual landslides. The Heichang Road (from Nagqu to Chamdo) was originally a non-standard "emergency" road. The 89-kilometer dirt road on both sides of the Xuelashan Mountain becomes impassable during heavy snowfall and the rainy season. The reconstructed Heichang Road will serve as a bypass for the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, alleviating traffic congestion during closures. Currently, more than two-thirds of the road has been completed, and it is expected to be operational next year.

The renovation of the old city area of Lhasa began in 1979 and has been ongoing in phases for a decade, with a cumulative national investment of over 56 million yuan. The plan is to complete the renovation by the end of 1990, making the old city look brand new. Over the past three years, 91,000 square meters of dilapidated houses have been renovated, and more than 1,300 households have moved into new homes. To further improve Lhasa's public facilities, the city's water supply network and internal telephone system renovation projects will also commence soon. The North Suburb Water Plant is nearing completion, and the design plan for the 27.1-kilometer pipeline system is under review. It is expected that 60% of Lhasa residents will soon have access to convenient tap water.

    西藏加紧建设一批重点项目
    国家累计投资13亿元
    本报拉萨12月9日电　记者卢小飞报道：国家累计投资13亿元以上的一批重点建设项目，近日正在西藏高原加紧施工。
    这批重点建设项目有：拉萨贡噶机场扩建、羊卓雍湖抽水蓄能电站、中尼公路和黑昌公路改造、青藏公路整治和羊八井地热电站二厂三期工程；世界粮食计划署援助的3357项目的配套工程和11个商品粮及牧业基地县的建设。还有拉萨老城区改造、布达拉宫维修和罗布莎铬铁矿等建设项目。
    各有关方面负责人告诉记者，这批重点建设项目关系到国计民生。国家投资近2亿元的贡噶机场扩建工程进度较快，场、道土石方已完成设计的71％，已开始浇注跑道混凝土基础，新建的4000米跑道，是我国西南地区最长的跑道，明年底可交付使用。通讯导航、客运候机大楼及其它附属建筑也将陆续开工。扩建后的拉萨贡噶机场将是世界上海拔最高的现代化机场。
    拉萨至樟木口岸的中尼公路，被中尼两国人民誉为友谊路，也是连接前、后藏的要道。这项工程1986年上马，明年底可完工。目前已完成70公里的沥青路，架起了尼木桥和仁布桥，横跨雅鲁藏布江的第三座大桥——托下桥，已经竖起了桥墩，大竹卡一带的农民，再不用因为摆渡过江而发愁了。
    川藏公路是西藏的第二条“生命线”，其中段的砂石山体受雨季影响，年年塌方。黑昌路（那曲至昌都）原来是一条无标准的“急造”公路，雪拉山两侧89公里的土路每到大雪封山和雨季时，便无法通车，改造后的黑昌路将成为川藏公路的复线，以缓解其阻断时交通之急。目前，2／3以上的路段已完工，预计明年通车。
    拉萨老城区的改造从1979年开始，分期分批进行，已持续了整整10年，国家累计投资5600多万元，计划在1990年底以前，使老城焕然一新。目前为止的3年间，已改造危房9.1万平方米。1300多户居民陆续住上新房。为进一步完善拉萨市的公用设施，市区供水管网和市内电话改造工程，也将在近期开工，与其配套的北郊水厂即将建成，总长27.1公里的管道系统，设计方案正在审核之中，60％的拉萨居民用上方便的自来水指日可待。
