Without music, without sound, accompanied by the colorful falling leaves of "Red Leaf" in his thoughts, he appeared. Deep remembrance, silent pursuit, in a poetic dream, there is a path of his heart.

To say he is like a red leaf is most fitting. At 14, he joined the army, from the engineering troops' cultural troupe to the dance school to the war comrades' song and dance troupe, he has walked 15 years, one step at a time, not competing with the hundred flowers in spring, but shining brightly under the sun. In 1982, his debut work "Youth" won the first prize in the national military dance competition, but at that time, people did not pay much attention to this newcomer. In 1983, he directed the one-act dance drama "Wreath," but due to a clash in themes, it was aborted midway. The turning point came in 1985 when he won the national second Peach Blossom Cup Dance Competition with his self-directed and performed solo dance "Prison Song." "Prison Song" was also listed as a required item for subsequent Peach Blossom Cup competitions. From then on, he gradually entered his prime. In 1986, he won the first prize in the national dance competition, and in 1987, "Line Emotion" and in 1989, "Red Leaf" followed, finally gaining recognition from his dance peers inside and outside the military.

As a dancer, he is naturally endowed with flexibility and rhythm, every move is precise and expressive; as a choreographer, he is good at attaching his inner emotions to physical movements in a concrete way, without deliberately pursuing profound meanings, but rather infusing emotions into silence. When he combines directing and performing, this deep understanding of dance art forms a poetic and picturesque style like lotus flowers emerging from clear water. He is not Su Shijin's "symphony," nor is he Hua Chao's "philosophical poem." What he is proficient in is the traditional Chinese painting technique of line drawing, smooth and delicate, thread by thread. "Line Emotion" can best illustrate his style. The scene of a couple sitting together weaving winter clothes before a departure is simple enough to be summarized in one sentence, but his skill lies in unraveling the intricate emotions of a newlywed's parting. The thread that cannot be cut, the emotions that are tangled when cut, the thread has an end but the emotion is endless. In contrast, the movements in "Prison Song" are much larger. A bundle of black leather straps symbolizing an iron prison wraps around him, and he struggles and breaks free, with passion always bursting out in a rhythm with intent.

In life, he is quiet and speaks little. A question that often troubles him is: how can dance art be better popularized? During the Spring Festival of 1988, he took "Youth" and "Line Emotion" to Sichuan for a performance. The local audience sighed at the beauty of the dance. This inspired him: although professional art troupes should go deep into the grassroots, can't we also reserve a place for artistic dance? He also thought of the situation in 1986 when he went to the other side of the ocean to participate in the American Dance Festival. He shone brightly and was praised as the "prince" of the dance festival, and also opened his eyes, personally experiencing that the development and improvement of dance art cannot be separated from a broad mass base. However, when someone advised him to stay in the United States to perform, after some thought, he politely declined. He knew deeply that his creative foundation was in China, and all the artistic works he poured his heart into expressed the true feelings of the Chinese people. He firmly believed that the hard work of generation after generation of Chinese dance artists would not be in vain.

The lonely days are indeed short. Once he is immersed in the creation and rehearsal of new works, he feels extraordinarily fulfilled. Just after nurturing "Red Leaf," a new idea has matured. Next year is his thirtieth year, and he wants to present a personal works evening. The stage covered with red leaves, the land full of yearning, in his heart, forever fresh and red...

    红叶情
    ——记青年舞蹈家赵明
    王晓岭
    没有音乐，没有声响，伴着思绪中缤纷飘落的《红叶》，他出场了。深深地缅怀，默默地追寻，如诗的梦境中，有一条属于他的心路历程。
    说他就是一片这样的红叶再恰当不过了。14岁当兵，从工程兵文工团到舞蹈学校到战友歌舞团，15年一步一个脚印地走过来，不与百花争春，艳阳下自有熠熠光彩。1982年他的处女作《青春》获全军舞蹈比赛表演一等奖，但那时人们并未太注意初出茅庐的他。1983年编导了独幕舞剧《花环》，又因题材撞车中途夭折。转折点是1985年，他以自编自演的独舞《囚歌》折桂全国第二届桃李杯舞蹈大赛，《囚歌》还被列为此后桃李杯赛的规定剧目。从此渐入佳境，1986年他荣获全国舞蹈比赛表演一等奖，1987年的《线情》和1989年的《红叶》又接踵打响，军内外的舞蹈同行们终于对他刮目相看了。
    作为舞蹈演员，他天生具备柔韧性和韵律感，举手投足都到位传神；作为舞蹈编导，他善于把内心情感具象化地附着在形体动作上，并不刻意追求微言大义，有情化入无言中。当他集编导演于一身时，这种对舞蹈艺术的深刻理解，便形成了清水出芙蓉般的诗情画意。他不是苏时进的“交响乐”，也不是华超的“哲理诗”，驾轻就熟的是传统中国画的线描技法，流畅细腻，丝丝入扣。《线情》很能说明他的风格，出征前夫妻对坐织寒衣的情节单纯得一句话便可概括，他的功力在于抽茧剥丝地展示新婚别离的难言心态。理不断的线，剪还乱的情，线有尽时情无终。相形之下《囚歌》的动作幅度要大得多，一束象征铁窗牢狱的黑皮条缠裹着他，他挣扎奔突，激情始终在有意韵的律动中迸发。
    生活中的他沉默寡言，一个时常困扰他的问题是：舞蹈艺术怎样才能更好地大众化。1988年春节时他带着《青春》和《线情》去四川演出，当地观众感叹这舞蹈的美。这使他受到了启发：虽然专业文艺团体要深入基层，但能不能也为艺术舞蹈常留一席之地呢。他又想到了1986年去大洋彼岸参加全美国舞蹈节的景况，他大显了风光，被誉为舞蹈节的“王子”，也大开了眼界，亲身体会到舞蹈艺术的发展提高离不开广泛的群众基础。然而有人劝他留在美国献技时，他一番思考后还是婉言谢绝了。他深知，自己的创作根基在中国，所有倾注心血的艺术品表现的都是炎黄子孙的真情实感。他坚信，一代代中国舞蹈艺术家们的艰辛努力决不会付之东流。
    寂寞的日子毕竟是短暂的，一旦投入新作品的创作试排，他又觉得异常充实。刚刚培育出《红叶》，一个新设想又成熟了。明年是他的而立之年，他想拿出一台个人作品晚会。那铺满红叶的舞台，那充满憧憬的领地，在他心头永远鲜红欲滴……
