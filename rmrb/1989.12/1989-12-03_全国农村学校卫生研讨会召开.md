	National Rural School Health Symposium Held
	According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: The first national symposium on rural school health work was recently held in Yongfeng County, Jiangxi. The meeting discussed and exchanged academic views on health education for rural students and the prevention and treatment of common diseases.

	Experts attending the symposium emphasized that health education for rural primary and secondary school students should strengthen guidance on their psychology, personality, intelligence, and behavior, including education on sexual knowledge and hygiene. They also pointed out that the current focus for preventing and treating common diseases among rural primary and secondary school students should be on effectively addressing diseases with high incidence rates such as intestinal worms, trachoma, scabies, lice, dysentery, and hepatitis. At the same time, efforts should be made to prevent vision decline, dental caries, malnutrition, and iron-deficiency anemia, and measures should be taken to solve the drinking water problem for primary and secondary school students.

	This symposium was jointly organized by the Chinese Journal of School Health, the Jiangxi Provincial Health Epidemic Prevention Station, and the Yongfeng County People's Government. Invited to attend the meeting were leaders and experts from relevant departments of the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Health, and 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, totaling more than 150 people.
