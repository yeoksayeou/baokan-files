The three-day debate in the Greek Parliament on the current government's policy statement concluded on the morning of the 2nd, with the government securing a vote of confidence. Athens newspapers reported that this vote of confidence has given the Zolotas government the green light to smoothly implement its plans to reduce the national public sector deficit and curb the rising inflation.

The Zolotas government is composed of technocrats and members of Greece's three major parties, and it has won the support of 295 out of the 300 seats in the parliament.

    希腊联合政府获议会信任票
    希腊议会就审议现政府的施政声明而举行的三天辩论会于二日早晨结束，政府获得信任票。雅典报刊报道说，该信任票为佐洛塔斯政府开了绿灯，以便使它顺利实施其削减国家公共部门的赤字，遏制日趋高涨的通货膨胀等计划。
    佐洛塔斯政府由专家治国论者和希腊三大政党的成员组成，在有三百个议席的议会中赢得二百九十五个议席的支持。
