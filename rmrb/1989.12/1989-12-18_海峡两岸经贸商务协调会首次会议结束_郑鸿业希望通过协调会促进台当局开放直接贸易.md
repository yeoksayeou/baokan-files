The two-day first committee meeting of the Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Coordination Council and the Cross-Strait Business Coordination Council concluded today in Hong Kong. Both sides' representatives expressed hope to promote economic and trade exchanges and development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, aiming to achieve two-way exchanges and direct trade.

Zheng Hongye, the chairman of the Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Coordination Council from the mainland, said in his speech that despite numerous difficulties in the development of cross-strait economic and trade exchanges, steady and solid work will yield satisfactory results in one, two, or three years. He pointed out that the current indirect trade between the two sides is not conducive to the development of economic and trade relations, and thus advocates for two-way, direct trade. He said that through this civilian organization, the coordination council, we hope to promote the opening of direct trade by the Taiwanese authorities and facilitate two-way exchanges between businesspeople on both sides.

Zhang Pingzhao, the chairman of the Cross-Strait Business Coordination Council from Taiwan, said in his speech, "A good beginning is half the success." Although the past journey has been arduous and winding, we have taken a successful step forward. The work ahead will be even more arduous and important. He said that we must strive to do more beneficial and forward-looking work to promote two-way communication and exchanges in the business sectors on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. He hopes that cross-strait trade will continue to grow, and that two-way economic and trade issues will be reasonably resolved.

During today's meeting, members from both sides conducted group discussions and initial communications on issues such as arbitration, mediation, trademarks, patents, legal services, and business consultations.

    海峡两岸经贸商务协调会首次会议结束
    郑鸿业希望通过协调会促进台当局开放直接贸易
    新华社香港12月17日电  （记者端木来娣）为期两天的海峡两岸经贸协调会和海峡两岸商务协调会第一次委员会会议今天在香港结束。双方委员希望促进海峡两岸经贸交流和发展，以达到两岸经贸双向交流和直接贸易的目的。
    大陆方面的海峡两岸经贸协调会会长郑鸿业致词说，尽管两岸经贸交流发展的道路上有不少困难，但我们踏踏实实地工作，一年、两年、三年定会取得可喜成果。他说，两岸目前仍处于间接贸易的阶段，这不利于两岸经济贸易的发展，因此我们倡导双向、直接贸易。他说，我们希望通过协调会这一民间机构来促进台湾当局开放直接贸易，促进两岸工商界人士进行有来有往的双向交流。
    台湾方面的海峡两岸商务协调会会长张平沼致词说，俗话说：“好的开始是成功的一半”。虽然过去的路十分艰辛、曲折，但我们已踏出了成功的一步，今后的工作将更艰巨、更重要。他说，我们要努力进行更有益、前瞻性的工作，促进海峡两岸工商业的双向沟通和交流。希望两岸贸易持续增长，使双向经贸问题得到合理的解决。
    在今天的会议上，双方成员就仲裁、调解、商标专利、法律服务、工商咨询等问题进行了分组讨论和初步沟通。
