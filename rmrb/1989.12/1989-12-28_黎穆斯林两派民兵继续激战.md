The situation in southern Lebanon remains tense today, with the Syrian-backed "Amal" movement and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah continuing their fourth day of clashes.

According to the Lebanese Muslim radio station "Voice of the Homeland," some Palestinian armed forces have also been drawn into the conflict.

Local security officials reported that this battle is a continuation of the clashes between the two Muslim militias since May 1987, as they vie for control over the 1.2 million Shia Muslims.

Despite calls from Syria and Iran for a ceasefire, both sides are currently sending reinforcements to the conflict zone. So far, 34 people have been killed and more than 150 injured in this round of fighting, most of whom are civilians.

    黎穆斯林两派民兵继续激战
    新华社贝鲁特12月26日电  黎巴嫩南部的局势今天仍然紧张，叙利亚支持的穆斯林“阿迈勒”运动和亲伊朗的真主党已经连续激战4天。
    据黎巴嫩穆斯林电台“祖国之声”广播，一些巴勒斯坦武装力量也卷入了这场冲突。
    据当地治安人士说，这场战斗是穆斯林两派民兵自1987年5月以来，为争夺对120万什叶派穆斯林的控制权而爆发冲突的继续。
    尽管叙利亚和伊朗已呼吁两派民兵停火，但交战双方目前仍在向冲突地区增派援兵。迄今，已有34人在这次战斗中被打死，150多人受伤，其中大多数是平民。
