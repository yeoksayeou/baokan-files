The second Asian Women's Weightlifting Championship concluded with the Chinese team sweeping all nine weight classes, securing 27 gold medals. In the team points tally, China leads with 438 points, followed by South Korea with 338 points, and Chinese Taipei with 325 points.

In the 75kg snatch event held this afternoon, Chen Shuizhi of Chinese Taipei successfully lifted 82.5kg and 87.5kg. Li Shuping of China attempted 90kg on her first try but failed twice, causing tension both on and off the field. Fortunately, she succeeded on her third attempt. Chen Shuizhi, unwilling to concede, attempted 92.5kg but failed due to impatience. Li Shuping then took the lead in the clean and jerk with a 125kg lift, securing the first place in the overall standings. Chen Shuizhi won three silver medals.

China's Shang Feng and Zhang Yanchai each won three gold medals in the 82.5kg and over 82.5kg categories, respectively.

Xue Deming, Secretary-General of the Chinese Weightlifting Association, praised the competition, noting that it was held just a month after the World Championships and saw three athletes break six world records ten times, making it a remarkable achievement.

Mr. Xin Jianming, Chairman of the Chinese Taipei Weightlifting Association, commented, "Last month, I met a group of world-class Chinese female athletes, and this time, they were all replaced by a new team. I didn't expect their strength to be on par, if not superior."

    亚洲女子举重锦标赛结束
    金牌全部归中国
    本报上海12月24日电　第二届亚洲女子举重锦标赛以中国队包揽所有9个级别的27枚金牌而告结束。至此，在团体积分表上，中国队以432分高居榜首，南朝鲜队次之（338分），中国台北队以325分获第3名。
    今天下午进行的75公斤级抓举比赛里，中国台北选手陈淑枝先以82.5公斤和87.5公斤稳稳抓起两把。中国队李淑萍第一把就要了90公斤，谁知两次失败，场上场下都紧张注视着她第三把试举，好在终于成功。陈淑枝不甘落后，第三把要了92.5公斤，可惜急于求成，未等抓到关节处便急于上举而导致失败。李淑萍乘胜追击，挺举以125公斤的绝对优势取胜，并拿下了总成绩第一名。陈淑枝获3枚银牌。
    中国队尚峰和张艳彩以较大优势各自赢得82.5公斤级和82.5公斤以上级3枚金牌。
    中国举重协会秘书长薛德明称赞本届比赛在今年世界锦标赛后一个月举行，又有3人10次超6项世界纪录，实在不容易。
    中国台北举重协会主席辛建明先生说，上个月我刚认识了一批世界级的中国女选手，这次全部换了一批队员，想不到实力不相上下，甚至更高。　（郑源镐）
