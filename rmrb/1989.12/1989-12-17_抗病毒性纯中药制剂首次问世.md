The first pure Chinese herbal antiviral drug has been successfully developed. The New China News Agency reported from Beijing that according to relevant national departments, Liaoning Province has successfully developed a pure Chinese herbal antiviral drug with no toxic side effects. Experts believe this is a major breakthrough in the history of Chinese herbal medicine research in China.

To overcome the shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine in lacking sufficient killing power against bacteria and viruses, experts from Benxi Pharmaceutical Factory and Shenyang College of Pharmacy collaborated, after years of research and exploration, successfully developed an antiviral pure Chinese herbal drug using common herbs such as Isatis root, Pogostemon cablin, Forsythia suspensa, and Reed root. This drug, named Antiviral Oral Liquid, is used to treat viral diseases.

Clinical trials by relevant units have shown that this oral liquid has a total effectiveness rate of over 90% in treating viral upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, mumps, and epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The total effectiveness rate for viral upper respiratory tract infections and epidemic conjunctivitis can reach 100%.

It is reported that this oral liquid is currently being produced at Benxi Pharmaceutical Factory and has been released into the domestic market.

    抗病毒性纯中药制剂首次问世
    新华社北京电　（通讯员夏儒全、记者熊金超）记者从国家有关部门获悉，辽宁省已成功地研制出一种无任何毒副作用的抗病毒性纯中药制剂。有关专家认为，这是我国中药研究史上的一次重大突破。
    为了克服传统中药对细菌、病毒缺乏足够杀伤力的不足，本溪制药厂和沈阳药学院的专家们合作，经过多年的研究和探索，终于用板兰根、藿香、连翘、芦根等普通中药，成功地研制出了一种用于治疗病毒性疾病的纯中药制剂——抗病毒口服液。
    有关单位的临床验证表明，这种口服液治疗病毒性上呼吸道炎、支气管炎、肺炎、腮腺炎及流行性出血结膜炎的总有效率高达90％以上，其中对病毒性上呼吸道炎和流行性红眼病的总有效率可达100％。
    据悉，这种口服液目前已在本溪制药厂投产，并已投放国内市场。
