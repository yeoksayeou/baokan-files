Title: Why the Compensation Rate for Preserving Value is Published Monthly

To make the current published compensation rate for preserving value more accurate and reasonable, starting from January 1990, the compensation rate for preserving value in savings will change from being published quarterly to being published monthly. This approach has two advantages:

First, the monthly compensation rate is closer to the actual situation compared to the quarterly compensation rate. Since the compensation rate for preserving value needs to be published before the start of each quarter, and the quarter has not yet ended at the time of publication, it can only use the price index of the previous quarter to calculate the compensation rate. This pushes the time forward by two quarters, making the time difference with the actual price fluctuation half a year. Similarly, after changing to monthly publication, it can only use the price index of the previous month to calculate the compensation rate. However, the time is only pushed forward by two months, shortening the time by four months compared to quarterly publication. Therefore, this calculation makes the benefits of the depositors closer to the actual situation.

Second, it increases the sensitivity of the compensation rate for preserving value. In the past, the compensation rate published quarterly used the average price index of a quarter, making it unclear whether the specific price index of each month within a quarter was higher or lower than the quarterly average. Therefore, it seemed unreasonable to compensate all savings that matured on any day within a quarter with the same compensation rate for preserving value. After changing to the monthly compensation rate, it can clearly reflect the seasonal price fluctuations between months. (November 25, 1989, Economic Daily, excerpted from Xing Benxiu's article)

    保值贴补率为何按月公布
    为了使现行公布的保值贴补率更为准确、更为合理，从一九九零年一月开始保值储蓄贴补率由原来的按季公布改为按月公布。这样做有两个好处：
    第一、月贴补率比季贴补率更接近于实际。由于保值贴补率要在每季到来之前公布，而公布时的当季尚未期满，只能使用隔季的物价指数计算贴补率。这样时间向前推了两个季度，与实际物价波动的时间相差半年之久。同样，保值贴补率改月公布后，也只能使用隔月的物价指数计算贴补率。但时间只向前推了两个月，比按季公布的时间缩短了四个月，因而这样计算就使得储户的收益更接近实际。
    第二、提高了保值贴补率的灵敏度。由于过去按季公布的贴补率所采用的物价指数是一个季度的平均数，反映在一个季度内每个月具体的物价指数是多少，是高于季度的平均数呢，还是低于季度的平均数就不太明确。这样凡是在一个季度内，不管是哪一天到期的保值储蓄存款，都按同一个保值贴补率给予贴补也就显得不够合理。而改为月贴补率后，就能明显地反映出月与月之间的季节性物价波动。（十一月二十五日《经济日报》邢本秀文曾维摘）
