As Jilin Province's "Year of Livestock," which was declared at the beginning of the year, came to a close, news of the livestock industry achieving its highest production value in history was announced: for the first time, the province achieved self-sufficiency in pork; the production of sheep, cattle, poultry, and livestock products all set new historical records. This marks a significant step forward for this major grain-producing province in its goal of developing the livestock industry into an independent pillar industry that complements grain production.

According to statistics, this year the province's pig-raising quantity reached 8.54 million heads, with 3.829 million heads being slaughtered, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year, thus ending the history of importing tens of millions of pigs from outside the province each year. The number of sheep raised reached 2.683 million heads, cattle reached 1.959 million heads, dairy cows reached 490,000 heads, and poultry exceeded 100 million heads, all surpassing the historical high of 1988. The livestock industry's production value reached 1.5 billion yuan, a 6.38% increase compared to 1988.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Jilin Province's total grain production has continuously reached the 100 billion kilogram and 150 billion kilogram marks. Per capita grain possession has reached over 700 kilograms. However, the livestock industry remained relatively backward. As early as 1987, the provincial party committee and government made the strategic decision to vigorously develop the livestock industry and transform the practice of exporting grain for meat. At the beginning of this year, the goal of "ensuring self-sufficiency in pork; continuing to develop dairy cows, sheep, and poultry on a higher basis; and integrating livestock, industry, and commerce into a 'one-stop' service" was proposed. At the same time, the goal of "separating the livestock industry from household sideline production and building it into a relatively independent pillar industry" was set.

Various cities and counties have successively introduced a series of preferential policies and measures, such as implementing a protection price purchase when the supply of pigs exceeds demand and prices fall; purchasing wool based on net weight and implementing a policy of paying more for better quality; establishing a livestock industry development fund, etc.

The provincial finance department allocated 10 million yuan in revolving funds to support 17 counties (cities) in focusing on pig farming. The provincial agricultural development investment company invested 25.8 million yuan to support large-scale pig farming. The provincial agricultural bank, despite tightening credit, issued 477 million yuan in loans to the livestock industry this year.

Various regions rely on technology to promote livestock development and strengthen livestock research and promotion. The province adopted a comprehensive technology of good sheds, good breeds, good feed, and good methods, with 565,000 pigs raised using this technology, an increase of 31.4% compared to last year.

In response to the long-standing issues of production-sales disconnection and uncoordinated services in the livestock industry, Jilin Province began exploring reforms in the livestock production system. The promotion of organizational innovations such as farms and stations leading households and companies leading farmers has further integrated the raising of thousands of households with large-scale operations. The Jilin Provincial Livestock and Poultry Company, established only over a year ago, and the provincial agricultural science academy jointly built a breeding system for high-quality egg-laying chickens. They introduced ISA parent stock chickens from abroad, established 17 parent stock chicken farms, and the commercial offspring chickens produced cover the entire province.

    政策倾斜　科技兴牧　体制创新
    吉林省“畜牧年”大丰收
    畜牧产量产值均创历史最高水平
    本报讯　据《吉林日报》记者仇方迎、徐海报道：当吉林省年初命名的“畜牧年”降下帷幕的时候，传出了畜牧业总产值创历史最高水平的喜讯：首次实现生猪自给；羊、牛、禽及畜禽产品产量全部创历史新纪录。这标志着这个粮食生产大省，朝着把畜牧业建成与粮食生产相协调的独立支柱产业的目标，迈出突破性的一步。
    据统计，今年全省生猪饲养量达到854万头，出栏达到382.9万头，比上年增长8.3％，从而结束了每年从省外调进二三十万头生猪的历史。羊的饲养量达到268.3万头，牛的饲养量达到195.9万头，奶牛饲养量达到4.9万头，禽的饲养量突破1亿只，分别超过历史最高的1988年。畜牧业产值达到15亿元，比1988年增长6.38％。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，吉林省粮食总产量连续跨上了100亿公斤和150亿公斤两个台阶。人均占有粮食达700多公斤。但畜牧业仍处于相对落后的地位。早在1987年，省委、省政府就作出了大力发展畜牧业，变出粮进肉为就地转化的战略决策。今年初提出“猪肉要保证自给；奶牛、羊、禽继续在较高的基础上有所发展；牧工商、产加销‘一条龙’”的工作目标，同时提出“把畜牧业从家庭副业中分离出来，建成一个相对独立的支柱产业”。
    各地市县的一系列倾斜政策和优惠措施也相继出台，如，生猪生产出现产大于销，价格下跌时，国家实行保护价收购；羊毛收购按净毛率计价，实行优质优价；建立畜牧业发展基金等。
    省财政拿出1000万元周转金，重点支持了17个县（市）以养猪为重点的畜牧业生产，省农业开发投资公司投资2580万元，支持规模养猪；省农行在紧缩银根的情况下，今年给畜牧业累计发放贷款4.77亿元。
    各地依靠科技兴牧，大力加强畜牧科研和推广工作。全省采用良舍、良种、良料、良法配套技术养猪数量达56.5万头，比上年增长31.4％。
    针对畜牧业生产中长期存在的产销脱节、服务不配套等问题，吉林省开始畜牧业生产体制改革的探索。以场、站带户和公司带农户等组织创新形式的推广，使千家万户饲养和规模经营进一步结合起来。成立只有1年多的吉林省畜禽总公司，和省农科院共同建设蛋鸡良种繁育体系，从国外引进伊莎祖代蛋种鸡，建立父母代鸡场17个，所产商品代蛋鸡覆盖全省。
