The once-impoverished Yan'an region in northern Shaanxi, known for its scarcity of grain and money, has seen significant changes since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy in 1979. Not only has the basic food and clothing needs of the majority of farmers been met, but the local fiscal revenue has also experienced continuous and substantial growth over the past 11 years. From January to November this year, the region's fiscal revenue surpassed the 200 million yuan mark, a 66.6% increase compared to the same period last year, with a net increase of 83.57 million yuan.

Before the reform and opening-up in 1978, this impoverished region's local fiscal revenue was a mere 26.15 million yuan, relying almost entirely on national financial subsidies. Since the reform and opening-up, the region has learned from past lessons and decisively closed, stopped, merged, and transformed a batch of "burden enterprises" that lacked raw materials, had no market for their products, and had no prospects for development. This allowed the region to move forward with a lighter burden. Subsequently, leveraging the local energy advantages and adapting to market needs, the region gradually formed a rational industrial layout of "north oil, south coal, and central light textiles." Around this layout, the key developments in petroleum, coal, cigarettes, and wool products have constructed the framework of Yan'an's industry. Currently, their output value accounts for three-quarters of the region's total industrial output value, and their tax and profit accumulation account for more than 85% of the region's total, becoming the "money tree" of this impoverished region.

    立足当地资源　构筑工业框架
    延安财政收入11年翻3番
    本报西安电　记者景险峰报道：昔日缺粮少钱的陕北延安老区，自1979年实行改革开放政策以来，不仅基本解决了广大农民的温饱问题，而且地方财政收入连续11年大幅度增长。今年1月至11月，全区财政收入突破2亿元大关，比去年同期增长66.6％，净增8357万元。
    改革开放前的1978年，这个贫困地区的地方财政收入仅2615万元，基本上靠吃国家财政补贴过日子。改革开放以来，这个地区认真吸取教训，果断关、停、并、转了一批原料无基地、产品无销路、发展无指望的“包袱企业”，开始轻装前进。紧接着，发挥当地的能源优势，适应市场需要，逐步形成“北油、南煤、中轻纺”的合理的工业布局。围绕这个布局，重点开发的石油、煤炭，卷烟、毛线等4个拳头产品，构筑起了延安工业的框架。目前，其产值已占全地区工业总产值的3／4，税利积累占全地区的85％以上，成了这个贫困地区的“摇钱树”。
