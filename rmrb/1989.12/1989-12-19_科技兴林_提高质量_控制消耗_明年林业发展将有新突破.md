Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th. People's Daily reporters Jiang Xia and Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jianjun report: How will China's forestry industry develop in the first year of the 1990s? Today, at the national forestry bureau directors' meeting, Minister of Forestry Gao Dezhan, based on the requirements of rectification and deepening reform, outlined several major measures around the goals of protecting and developing forest resources and enhancing the vitality of forestry. These measures aim to ensure breakthrough progress in forestry construction and reform in the new year.

Accelerating afforestation progress, improving afforestation quality, improving forest stand quality, and increasing timber growth are the primary tasks of forestry construction in the first year of the 1990s. The Ministry of Forestry plans to afforest 82 million mu in 1990.

Gao Dezhan pointed out that vigorously promoting science and technology in forestry is a directionally and strategically important task. First, efforts should be made to improve afforestation and forest management quality by vigorously promoting seed selection, scientific seedling cultivation, scientific planting, and scientific tending and thinning techniques.

Gao Dezhan announced that 1990 will be a transitional year, with a full-scale trial of logging quota management in key state-owned forestry enterprises, implementing full management and statistics for all resource consumption. Starting from 1991, logging quota management will be fully implemented nationwide.

Gao Dezhan proposed: Next year, the number of forest fires and the affected area should further decrease based on the good results achieved this year, striving to prevent major forest fires; the area of forest pest and disease control should be increased from 30% of the affected area to 50%; by the first half of next year, major and severe deforestation cases that have occurred in the past should be basically investigated and dealt with, and various forestry administrative cases should significantly decrease.

    科技兴林  提高质量  控制消耗
    明年林业发展将有新突破
    本报北京12月18日讯　本报记者江夏、新华社记者张建军报道：我国林业90年代第一年将如何发展？林业部长高德占今天在全国林业厅局长会议上，根据治理整顿、深化改革的要求，围绕着保护和发展森林资源、增强林业活力的目标，推出几项重大措施，以确保林业建设和改革在新的一年里有突破性进展。
    加快造林进度，提高造林质量，提高林分质量，提高林木生长量，是90年代第一年林业建设的首要工作。林业部计划1990年造林8200万亩。
    高德占指出，大力开展科技兴林，是带有方向性、战略性的重要任务。首先要围绕提高造林、营林质量，大力推广良种选育、科学育苗、科学种植和科学抚育间伐技术。
    高德占宣布，1990年作为过渡阶段，先在重点国营森工企业中全面试行采伐限额计划管理，对全部资源消耗实行全额管理、全额统计。从1991年开始，将在全国全面实行采伐限额计划管理。
    高德占提出：明年森林火灾次数和受害面积，要在今年取得好成绩的基础上进一步下降，力争不发生大的森林火灾；要把森林病虫害防治面积占发生面积的30％提高到50％；要在明年上半年，把过去发生的重大、特大毁林案件基本查处完毕，各类林政案件要明显下降。
