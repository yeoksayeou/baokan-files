Today (November 28), the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's Women and Youth Committee and the Education and Culture Committee jointly held a meeting to discuss the major issue of "Eliminating Harm and Promoting Benefits, Optimizing the Growth Environment for Adolescents." While the Party Central Committee and the State Council are vigorously promoting the "anti-pornography" campaign, they have also proposed the elimination of "six harms." These are wise decisions. Eliminating harm means eliminating spiritual pollution, and promoting benefits means promoting spiritual civilization. The goal is to cultivate a generation of socialist youth with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, to foster a generation of successors who will build a prosperous, civilized, and democratic socialist modernized strong country, one generation surpassing the next. This is an important strategic decision to ensure that our country advances along the socialist path and achieves the Four Modernizations. This meeting is just the beginning. In the future, such meetings should be held annually, with a broader scope and longer duration. The great cause of socialist modernization requires us to do so, and the objective situation both domestically and internationally compels us to do so. Imperialism is adopting a strategy of "peaceful evolution" and "victory without war," attempting to wage a war without gunpowder to overthrow the Communist Party and subvert the socialist system. Faced with all this, how can we not be roused, unite, and work together to fight against their conspiracies!

The methods of international reactionary forces for "peaceful evolution" are numerous. I believe the main ones are as follows:

First, they send or buy spies and agents to infiltrate our ranks, develop spy organizations or other forms of counter-revolutionary organizations, and engage in sabotage activities within our ranks. They often use secret and covert methods. Some people even disguise themselves as progressives to infiltrate our leadership organs and confidential units. This is something we must be very vigilant about.

Second, they collude with and support so-called "dissidents" like Fang Lizhi and Chen Ziming to engage in open anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. They shamelessly glorify capitalist society and vilify socialist society, using deceptive methods to incite the masses to cause trouble, create chaos, and even lead to counter-revolutionary riots.

Third, they use threats and inducements to interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries, in coordination with creating chaos in socialist countries, attempting to force socialist countries to make concessions and follow the direction they hope for, making socialist countries "peacefully evolve" into capitalism and become appendages of international capital. Imperialists openly declare their policy of promoting political pluralism and economic marketization in socialist countries, that is, implementing bourgeois multi-party systems, rotating in power, and driving the Communist Party out of power, ultimately restoring capitalism. The economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western countries on us are an example of threats; the extraordinary reception and support given to so-called "dissidents" are an example of inducements.

Fourth, corrupting the minds of the younger generation is their most important tactic. They use all their propaganda machines to carry out bourgeois propaganda. In the past, they propagated "liberty, equality, fraternity," but because capitalist society is full of exploitation, oppression, and various degrees of racial discrimination, there is no equality or fraternity. They oppress and exploit their own people internally and invade and plunder externally. This has opened the eyes of the broad masses, who have seen through the hypocrisy of imperialism's so-called liberty, equality, and fraternity. Now they have changed their slogan to "democracy, freedom, human rights." It seems that capitalist society is a paradise on earth, where there is true democracy, freedom, and human rights, and where people's rights are truly guaranteed. Imperialist propaganda can have some influence on the younger generation because, while we are carrying out reform and opening up, we have weakened ideological and political work, especially the ideological education of young people. Practice has already proven and will continue to prove that Deng Xiaoping's pointing out that we must do two things: one is to push forward reform and opening up, and the other is to fight against corruption, is completely necessary and correct.

The Party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, solemnly points out that the struggle against subversion and counter-subversion, corruption and anti-corruption, and peaceful evolution and counter-peaceful evolution, is a serious, complex, and long-term struggle, a struggle concerning the life and death of our Party and country. In the face of this struggle, we must neither panic and lose confidence nor be complacent and take it lightly. If we do not strengthen education on the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely oppose the spread of bourgeois liberalization, if we do not do a good job in rectification and deepening reform, making our socialist economy develop healthily according to the principles of sustained, stable, and coordinated development, and thus continuously improving the material and cultural lives of the people, our country will still face major turmoil, and there is even the danger of the Party degenerating and the country changing color. That is to say, the Party will degenerate, and the country will change color. Not long ago, the major turmoil that occurred in our country gave us a profound political lesson. Isn't this enough to make us sober up? Seeing the problem more seriously can arouse the vigilance of the entire Party and all ethnic groups of the people, actively engage in this great struggle, educate our young people well, build our Party well, and build our country well. As long as there is a fundamental improvement in our Party's style, a fundamental improvement in our social customs, and continuous development in our socialist construction, our country will be stable and unshakable. What economic sanctions, what "peaceful evolution" reactionary conspiracies, they are all powerless against us! The future of our motherland is in the hands of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Our socialist New China was born and grew up on the road of self-reliance and hard struggle. Any difficulties and obstacles have been overcome by us. Thinking about the past can foresee the future, we believe that any difficulties and setbacks will be overcome one by one. The pessimistic and despairing viewpoints are groundless.

Regarding democracy, freedom, and human rights, our Constitution clearly stipulates the democratic, free, and other rights enjoyed by the people. The establishment of a socialist society has opened up a broad road for us to achieve our ideal. The continuous development of the superiority of the socialist system has enabled the people of all ethnic groups in our country to fully develop in the political, economic, and ideological and cultural fields. This is something that people without prejudice have experienced and acknowledged. Some confused or naive people think that the democracy, freedom, and human rights of capitalist society are much better than ours. This is because they do not understand the history and present state of capitalism. Taking Britain, where capitalism developed earliest, as an example, their laws once stipulated that only those with a certain amount of property had the right to vote. Women were not allowed to participate in elections. Farmers who lost their land, if they did not go to the city to work or engage in other normal occupations, were considered criminals and were punished. Now, although these practices have changed, and the British Labor Party has been in power, can they give workers the right not to be exploited and not to be fired?

The United States, known as the richest and most democratic country in the West, why do black people still suffer various discriminations to this day? Not only are there schools that do not allow black people to study with white people, but there are also restaurants that do not allow black people to eat. The Ku Klux Klan is still killing innocent black people without receiving due punishment. Indeed, the social status of black people in the United States has improved somewhat compared to a few decades ago, but we must see that they still suffer from various racial discriminations. The employment rate and wage treatment are much lower than that of whites. This shows how limited the freedom and rights enjoyed by black people are. In addition to black people, all colored people, including our Chinese descendants, are regarded as second-class citizens. This is the reality of the United States, which boasts the most freedom and human rights. Looking at the democracy of the United States, the presidential election requires several million dollars in election expenses. If they are not faithful agents of the bourgeoisie, can capitalists donate so much money to them? Senators and representatives cannot be elected without a considerable amount of money. This is the essence of American democracy—bourgeois democracy, that is, the democracy of a very few people, not the democracy enjoyed by the broad masses of the people. Our comrades should collect more materials, write articles, and give speeches to expose the hypocrisy and deception of bourgeois democracy and freedom, to educate our young people.

Some people say that our socialist country has no democracy, freedom, and human rights, or that human rights are not guaranteed. It is undeniable that we have made various mistakes in the past, causing some good comrades to be wrongly treated and wronged. This is a profound lesson, but our Party has rectified their wrong, false, and erroneous cases; our democratic procedures and legal system are not yet perfect, but since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party and state have been working very hard to improve these aspects; some of our Party and government cadres have bureaucratism, arbitrariness, and other improper practices and lawlessness, but our Party and government are in line with the will of the people, striving to overcome and eliminate these phenomena. These are facts that everyone can see. Moreover, in our socialist society, which has basically eliminated the system of exploitation, the Party and the state have been creating social conditions for the people to enjoy high democracy and freedom, so that the people's various rights are fully guaranteed. Our Constitution stipulates that the people are the masters of the state. Our judicial organs, on the one hand, protect the rights of the people, and on the other hand, suppress those counter-revolutionaries and serious lawbreakers who violate the interests of the people, all for the sake of protecting the interests of the people. The purpose of our Party is to serve the people wholeheartedly, and our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. The lines, policies, and principles of our Party are based on the greatest interests of the vast majority of the people. After being propagated and educated, they become the initiatives of the broad masses and the conscious actions of the masses. The mass line, the mass viewpoint, concentrating from the masses and returning to the masses, this is the democratic style of our Party, this is the essence of our socialist democracy. This is something that no capitalist country can ever achieve.

Here, we must also talk about the relationship between democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline, are opposites and unified, two sides of a whole, inseparable. We can think about it, without democratic centralization, it will be arbitrary, which we oppose. If there is only democracy and no centralization, isn't it anarchism? Can any problem be decided? The organizational principle of our Party is democratic centralism, and the political system of our country is democratic centralism. Although there are still some shortcomings in our implementation of democratic centralism, our Party has always insisted on overcoming various shortcomings and improving our democratic centralism. Any human society, as long as it is a social organization, must implement democratic centralism and cannot have one side without the other. Even in a communist society, the Communist Party will disappear, the state will disappear, and the government will be gone, but human society still exists, and the organizational management of human society still exists. It will have human management organs to distribute labor, distribute means of production, and distribute the necessities of people's lives. Communism is distribution according to need. At that time, can anyone take whatever they want? For example, those who study music, music teachers, and musicians need pianos, so they are distributed to them, but not everyone can take pianos regardless of whether they need them or not.

Regarding the issue of freedom and discipline, this is an even more common sense issue. Freedom and discipline are also opposites and unified, two sides of an inseparable whole. Absolute freedom will never exist. Without the restraint of discipline, anyone can act freely, and this society will perish. We can encounter examples every day, such as obeying traffic rules when walking on the street. Traffic rules are a kind of discipline, and violating traffic rules will be punished. In a communist society, maybe there will be no punishment. But criticism and education are always necessary. Imagine, if we do not have this traffic rule, can traffic still be smooth? The streets will be in chaos, and there will be countless casualties every day. This is obvious. Therefore, in the current stage, our country must have a Constitution and laws. Even in the future communist society, when the state disappears, various groups and organizations will still have their own disciplinary regulations. Otherwise, schools cannot teach, and factories cannot produce. This is a common sense of life that people will understand if they think about it. But some of our young comrades do not understand this logic. For example, applying for permission to parade, the parade route, and the order to be followed, does this restrict the freedom of students to parade? No, this is for the interests of the broad masses of the people. If it is said that workers, peasants, students, or cadres in government agencies can parade without permission, will our society not be in chaos? Can people go out on the streets? Can cars run? Can everyone go to work on time? During the turmoil in May and June this year, wasn't it that many public buses stopped running? Many people had to walk tens of miles to work. Some people lived in factories but could not go home. Our army helped transport grain and vegetables to ensure the necessary supplies for the lives of urban residents. If it is said that even the vehicles transporting grain and vegetables are blocked, what will we eat? Can we still live? In schools, some people want to go on strike, some want to parade, some oppose parading, some oppose going on strike, you have the freedom to parade, I have the freedom to oppose parading, right? Why is there no freedom to oppose? Those who oppose going on strike and parading are called traitors, ridiculed, and attacked, is this democracy? Is this freedom? You have your freedom, I have my freedom, why do you have the freedom to go on strike, and I do not have the freedom to go to class? In the group of students who went on hunger strike, some listened to advice and wanted to withdraw, but some said that if 100 people went on hunger strike, 99 opposed hunger strike, but as long as one person agreed to hunger strike, it could not be stopped. What kind of democracy is this? What about the minority obeying the majority? In short, many confused ideas, as well as the incitement and deception of some bad elements and counter-revolutionaries, have deceived many young students. Now, after reflection, most of them have awakened.

To realize the socialist and communist cause initiated by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, we must cultivate a new generation of socialist youth. This requires the efforts of the Party and the government, as well as various departments, especially the cultural, educational, broadcasting, television, newspaper, magazine, and teacher departments, and the efforts of parents and the broad masses of the people to create a social environment conducive to the healthy growth of adolescents. Comrade Liu Baiyu said that writers are engineers of the soul, and teachers should also be engineers of the soul. Parents, to their children, should even more be engineers of the soul. I think this is correct. Our cadres, Party members, teachers, and parents should all set an example for young people. If parents and teachers have bad work styles, they have no right to educate students. Conduct is more important than words, this is an absolute truth. Educating children, for young people and children, we must adopt a patient and persuasive method of education. Especially in schools, we must truly put ethics first. Our three-good students should have all-round development in ethics, intelligence, and physical fitness. In recent years, many schools have only pursued the admission rate while neglecting the moral education of students and not paying enough attention to the physical health of students. Many students wear glasses and suffer from neurasthenia. I require my children to prioritize morality first, physical health second, and intelligence third. Only when the body and moral character are good can learning be good. For many years, our students have had too heavy a burden, and now it is time to decisively solve this problem. Due to the heavy burden on students, the burden on parents has also increased, affecting their own learning and work.

I believe we should also pay special attention to educating young people to establish a communist worldview and outlook on life.

The worldview and outlook on life of young people are in the process of formation, and they are highly malleable. As long as they have a communist worldview and outlook on life, they will become qualified successors of the communist cause. Opposing the communist worldview and outlook on life is the vulgar and low-level individualism of the bourgeoisie, "everything for money," "money is everything." Nowadays, among young people, there are many confused ideas such as "self-value," "self-centeredness," and "self-subjectivity." They do not understand that in a socialist society, the relationship between people should be one of unity and mutual assistance, they do not understand that the value and meaning of life lie in dedication, and the pursuit of personal enjoyment will make one a parasite of society. The expansion of individualism will lead to degeneration and crime. In a socialist society, the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual are fundamentally consistent. Only when our country's economic construction has made great progress will the people's lives be greatly improved. The principle of socialism is distribution according to labor, and those who do not work shall not eat. We should praise those who work for the country and public interests without seeking rewards. Now we are advocating voluntary labor again, organizing young people to spend some time participating in voluntary labor, which is a very meaningful thing to cultivate a communist worldview and outlook on life. Lenin called Saturday voluntary labor a great creation, fully affirming the political significance of voluntary labor.

In the work of cultivating young people's communist worldview and outlook on life, our Communist Party members, Young Pioneers, and cadres should set an example in work, life, and study. We should vigorously praise and sing the praises of various advanced figures who shine with communist light, including advanced figures among young people, which has great practical significance for educating young people. Similarly, we must severely punish those corrupt and lawless elements, which is also an important aspect of creating a good environment for the growth of young people.

What is the meaning and value of life? What is happiness in life? We have discussed this in the past and will continue to discuss it in the future. Our answer to this question is clear and affirmative: dedicating all one's strength to the most beautiful ideal of mankind, to the socialist and communist cause, such a life is the most meaningful, the most valuable, and the happiest. Comrades should patiently and meticulously, with many specific good deeds, educate young people on this point, so as to help them grow up healthily.

    动员起来，为培养社会主义的一代新人而奋斗
    王任重
    今天（11月28日）全国政协妇女青年委员会和教育文化委员会共同举行会议，来讨论“除害兴益、优化青少年成长环境”的重大问题。党中央国务院在大抓“扫黄”的同时，又提出了除“六害”，这都是英明之举。除害就是除精神污染之害，兴益就是兴精神文明之益。目的是为了培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代社会主义新人，为建设富裕、文明、民主的社会主义现代化强国培养出一代接一代、一代胜过一代的接班人。这是保证我们国家沿着社会主义道路前进、实现四个现代化的一个重要战略决策。应该说这次会议只是个开始，今后应当每年开一次，范围可以更大一点，时间可以更长一点。社会主义现代化的伟大事业要求我们这样做，国际国内的客观形势也迫使我们非这样做不可。帝国主义采取“和平演变”、不战而胜的战略，他们企图打一场无硝烟的战争，来推翻共产党、颠覆社会主义制度，面对这一切我们怎么能不振奋起来，团结起来，同心协力，向他们的阴谋进行斗争呢！
    国际反动势力“和平演变”的方法很多。我认为主要的有下列几种：
    第一，派遣或收买特务、间谍分子，打入我们内部，发展特务组织或其他形式的反革命组织，在我们内部搞破坏活动。他们多采取秘密、隐蔽的方式，有些人甚至会装扮成进步分子，以便钻进我们的领导机关和机密单位。这是很值得我们警惕的。
    第二，拉拢和支持那些所谓的“持不同政见者”，如方励之、严家其一类人，进行公开的反共、反社会主义的活动。他们恬不知耻地美化资本主义社会，丑化社会主义社会，以欺骗的方法煽动群众闹事，制造动乱，直至反革命暴乱。
    第三，用威胁利诱的方法干涉社会主义国家的内政，与制造社会主义国家的动乱相配合，企图迫使社会主义国家向他们让步，按照他们所希望的方向，使社会主义国家“和平演变”到资本主义，变为国际资本的附庸。帝国主义者公开宣布他们的方针是在社会主义国家实行政治多元化、经济市场化，也就是说实行资产阶级多党制，轮流执政，赶共产党下台，最后复辟资本主义。以美国为首的西方七国，对我们实行经济制裁，就是威胁的一例；对所谓的“持不同政见者”超乎常规的接待和支援又是利诱的一例。
    第四，从思想上腐蚀青少年一代，是他们最注重的一手。他们开动一切宣传机器进行资产阶级的宣传活动。过去他们宣传的是“自由、平等、博爱”，因为资本主义社会的现实有的是剥削、压迫和不同程度的种族歧视，并没有什么平等，也没有什么博爱。他们对内压迫和剥削本国人民，对外是侵略和掠夺。这就使广大人民打开了眼界，认清了帝国主义的所谓自由、平等、博爱是虚伪的。现在他们换了一个口号，就是“民主、自由、人权”。好像资本主义社会是人间的天堂，那里真有什么人民的民主、自由，好像那里人民的权利真正得到了保障。帝国主义的宣传所以能在青少年中产生一定影响，是因为我们在改革开放的同时削弱了思想政治工作，特别是削弱了对青少年的思想教育。实践已经并将继续证明，邓小平同志指出的要两手抓：一手抓改革开放，一手抓反腐蚀斗争，是完全必要的，是完全正确的。
    以江泽民同志为核心的党中央，郑重指出，摆在我们面前的颠覆和反颠覆、腐蚀和反腐蚀、和平演变与反和平演变的斗争，是一场严重、复杂、长期的斗争，是关系到我们党和国家生死存亡的斗争。在这场斗争面前，我们既不能惊慌失措，丧失信心，又绝不能麻痹大意，掉以轻心。假如我们不加强坚持四项基本原则的教育，不坚决反对资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，假如我们不搞好治理整顿、深化改革，使我国的社会主义经济按照持续、稳定、协调发展的方针得到健康的发展，从而使人民的物质生活和文化生活得到不断改善，我们的国家还会发生大乱子，甚至有亡党亡国的危险，也就是说我们的党要变质、国要变色。不久前，我国发生的那场大的风波，给我们上了一堂深刻的政治课，还不足以使我们清醒些吗？把问题看得严重一些，以便唤起全党和全国各族人民的警惕，积极地投入这场伟大的斗争，把我们的青少年教育好，把我们的党建设好，把我们的国家建设好，只要我们的党风有一个根本性的好转，我们的社会风气有一个根本性的好转，我们的社会主义建设事业得到不断发展，那么我们的国家就会稳固，坚不可摧。什么经济制裁、什么“和平演变”的反动阴谋，都是无可奈我何的！我们祖国的前途掌握在我国各族人民的手中。我们社会主义新中国是在自力更生、艰苦奋斗的道路上诞生和成长起来的。任何艰难险阻都被我们战胜了，想想过去就可以预见到今后的前程，我们相信，任何困难和挫折都将被我们一个个克服。悲观失望的观点是没有根据的。
    关于民主、自由、人权，我们的宪法明文规定了人民享有的民主、自由和其他的各项权利。社会主义社会的建立，为我们达到理想境界开辟了广阔的道路。社会主义制度优越性的不断发挥，为我国各族人民在政治、经济、思想文化领域里获得了充分的发展。这是任何不怀偏见的人们都是体验到了的，都是承认的。有些糊涂的或幼稚的人们认为，资本主义社会的民主、自由、人权好像比我们美好得多。这是由于他们不了解资本主义的历史和现状。以资本主义发展最早的英国为例，他们的法律曾规定，只有拥有一定财产的人才能有选举权。妇女不能参加选举。失掉土地的农民如不进城做工或从事其他正常职业，就算犯法，要被治罪。现在虽然改变了这些做法，而且英国工党还曾经执过政，难道他们能给工人不受剥削、不被解雇的权利吗？
    美国号称西方世界最富有、最民主的国家，为什么到现在美国的黑人还受到种种歧视？不仅有的学校不准黑人与白人同学，而且有的饭店也不准黑人进去吃饭。三K党至今还在杀害无辜的黑人而受不到应有的惩罚。诚然，现在美国黑人的社会地位比几十年前有了某些提高，但是我们必须看到，他们遭受的种族歧视仍然比比皆是。就业率和工资待遇都大大低于白人。这说明黑人所享有的自由和权利是多么有限。除黑人之外，所有有色人种，包括我们的华裔，都被看做二等公民。这就是鼓吹最有自由、人权的美国的现状。再看看美国的民主，美国总统竞选要花几千万美元的竞选费用。如果不是资产阶级忠实的代理人，资本家能捐赠那么多钱给他们吗？参议员、众议员没有相当多的钱都是不可能当选的。这就是美国民主的实质——资产阶级民主即极少数人的民主，而不是广大人民享有的民主。我们的同志应多收集材料，写文章、做讲演来揭穿资产阶级民主自由的虚伪性、欺骗性，以教育我们的青少年。
    有人说我们社会主义国家没有民主、自由、人权，或者说人权没有保障。毋庸讳言，我们过去曾经犯过这样那样的错误，使一些好同志受到错误处理，受到冤屈，这是深刻的教训，但是我们的党给他们平反了冤、假、错案；我们的民主程序和法制还不够完善，但自党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党和国家一直花很大的气力而致力于这些工作；我们党和政府的少数干部存在着官僚主义、独断专行、以权谋私等等不正之风和违法乱纪现象，但我们党和政府与人民的意志是一致的，努力克服并消除这些现象。这些都是有目共睹的事实。不仅如此，在我们这样一个基本上消灭了剥削制度的社会主义社会，党和国家一直在为人民群众能够享受高度民主、自由而不断地创造着社会条件，使人民的各项权利得到充分的保障。我们宪法规定了人民是国家的主人。我们的司法机关一方面保护人民的权利，一方面镇压那些违反人民利益的反革命分子和严重的违法乱纪分子，这都是为了保护人民的利益。我们党的宗旨是全心全意为人民服务，我们的干部无论职务高低都是人民的勤务员。我们党的路线、方针、政策是从最大多数人民的最大利益出发的。经过宣传教育变为广大群众自己的主张，变为群众自觉自愿的行动。我们经常讲的群众观点、群众路线，从群众中集中起来再到群众中坚持下去，这就是我们党的民主作风，这就是我们社会主义社会民主的实质。这是任何资本主义国家永远不可能做到的。
    这里还要说到民主和集中、自由和纪律的相互关系问题。毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中讲过，民主和集中、自由和纪律，都是对立统一的，是一个整体的两个侧面，是不可分割的。我们可以想一想，没有民主基础上的集中就会是独断专行。是我们所反对的。而只要民主不要集中不是成了无政府主义了吗？能够决定任何问题吗？我们党的组织原则是民主集中制，我们国家的政体是民主集中制。尽管我们在实行民主集中制上还存在某些缺点，但我们党总是一贯坚持克服种种缺点，更好地完善着我们的民主集中制。任何人类社会只要是一种社会组织，它就必须实行民主集中制，而不能只要一方面而不要另一方面。到了共产主义社会，共产党消亡了，国家也消亡了，政府也没有了，但人类社会还存在着，人类社会的组织还存在着，它总有人类的管理机关从事分配劳动，分配生产资料，分配人民生活的必需品。共产主义是按需分配，到那时能谁想要什么就拿什么吗？比如学音乐的，音乐教师、音乐家需要钢琴，就分配给他们，但不能每个人不管是否需要都去要钢琴。
    关于自由和纪律问题，这更是个普遍常识问题。自由和纪律也是对立的统一，是一个不可分割整体的两个侧面。绝对的自由是永远不会有的。没有纪律的约束，任何个人都可以自由行动，这个社会非灭亡不可。我们每天都可以碰到的例子，如走在街上要遵守交通规则。交通规则就是一种纪律，违反交通规则就要受到处罚。到了共产主义社会也许不受处罚。但批评教育总是必要的。请同志们设想一下，我们不要这个交通规则，交通还能通吗？大街上就会一片混乱，一天不知死伤多少人。这是显而易见的。所以在现阶段我们国家必须有宪法，有法律。即便将来到了共产主义社会，国家消亡了，但是各种团体，各种组织都要有自己的纪律规定。不然，学校无法教学，工厂无法生产。这是人们只要想一下都会懂得的生活常识。但我们有些青年同志就不大懂这个道理。比如游行示威要申请批准，游行，要走什么路线，要遵守什么秩序，难道这就限制了学生游行示威的自由吗？不是，这是为了广大人民群众的利益。假如说，不管工人、农民、学生或机关干部，不经批准，随便上街游行，我们的社会不就乱了吗？人们还能上街吗？车还能行驶吗？大家能按时上班吗？今年五、六月份动乱期间，不是许多公共汽车都停了吗？许多人只好走几十里路去上班。有的人就住在工厂回不了家。我们军队帮助运粮、运菜，来保证城市人民的生活必需品。假如说，连运粮、运菜的车都被堵塞了，那我们吃什么呢？还能生活下去吗？在学校，有人要罢课，有人要游行，有人反对游行，有人反对罢课，你有游行的自由，我反对游行也有自由吧？为什么没有反对的自由呢？反对罢课、游行的人被称作叛徒，被讽刺、被打击，这叫民主吗？这叫自由吗？你有你的自由，我有我的自由，为什么你有罢课的自由，我就没有上课的自由呢？绝食的学生中有些人听了劝告想退出，有人就说，一百个人绝食，九十九个反对绝食，但只要有一个人赞成绝食，就不能停止。这叫什么民主？还有什么少数服从多数？总之，许多糊涂观念，以及一些坏分子、反革命分子的煽动、欺骗，使许多青年学生上了当。现在经过反思，他们绝大多数人已经觉悟过来了。
    为了实现老一辈无产阶级革命家开创的社会主义、共产主义事业，我们必须培养社会主义的一代新人。这就要靠党和政府的努力，还要靠各个部门，特别是文化部门、教育部门、广播、电视、报刊、杂志以及教师、家长和广大人民的努力，才能创造一个有利于青少年健康成长的社会环境。刘白羽同志说，作家是灵魂的工程师，教师也应该是灵魂的工程师，做父母的对孩子来说更应是灵魂的工程师。我看很对。我们的干部、党员、教师、家长，都应该在青少年中起模范作用。如果家长、教师作风不好，就没有资格教育学生。身教重于言教，这是千真万确的真理。教育孩子，对青少年和儿童，要采取循循善诱、耐心教育的方法。特别是学校，必须把德育真正放在第一位。我们的三好学生，要德、智、体全面发展，这些年来许多学校只追求升学率，而对学生的品德教育忽视了，对学生的身体健康也关心不够。有很多学生戴眼镜和患神经衰弱。我要求我的孩子，道德第一、身体第二、智育第三。身体和道德品质好了，学习才能好，多年来我们的学生负担过重，现在到了下决心解决这个问题的时候了。由于学生负担过重而使家长负担也加重，妨碍了他们自己的学习和工作。
    我认为还要特别注重教育青少年树立共产主义的世界观和人生观。
    青少年的世界观和人生观正处于形成的过程之中，他们可塑性很大，只要他们有了共产主义的世界观和人生观，他们就会成为共产主义事业的合格的接班人。和共产主义世界观、人生观相对立的是资产阶级庸俗的、低级的个人主义，“一切向钱看”，“金钱万能”。现在青年当中流行着“自我价值”、“自我中心”、“自我主体”的许多糊涂观念。他们不了解社会主义社会人们的相互关系应当是团结友爱、互相帮助，他们不了解人生的价值、人生的意义在于奉献，而单纯地追求个人的享乐，一味地追求个人的享乐就会成为社会的寄生虫。个人主义的膨胀会使人堕落到犯罪的下场。在社会主义社会，国家、集体、个人三者之间的利益，根本上是一致的，只有我们国家经济建设有了巨大的发展，人民生活才会有巨大的改善。社会主义的原则是按劳分配，不劳动者不得食。我们要歌颂那些为国家和公共利益而不计报酬的劳动者，现在我们又开始提倡义务劳动，组织青少年抽出一定的时间参加义务劳动，这是培养共产主义世界观和人生观的非常有意义的事情。列宁把星期六义务劳动称作伟大的创举，充分肯定了义务劳动的政治意义。
    在培养青少年共产主义世界观和人生观的工作中，我们的共产党员、共青团员，我们的干部要在工作上、生活上、学习上起模范带头作用。我们要大力表扬和歌颂那些闪耀着共产主义光芒的各种先进人物，包括青少年中的先进人物，这对教育青少年有着重大的实际意义。同样，也要严惩那些贪污受贿、违法乱纪的坏分子，这也是创造有利于青少年成长的优良环境所不可缺少的一个重要方面。
    什么是人生的意义、人生的价值？什么是人生的幸福？过去我们在报刊上曾经讨论过，今后这个问题还应该讨论。对这个问题的讨论我们的答复是明确的、肯定的，为人类最美好的理想，为社会主义、共产主义事业贡献自己的一切力量，这样的生活才最有意义，才最有价值，这样的生活才是最幸福的。这样的道理，同志们要耐心地、细致地，用许多具体的好人好事向青少年进行教育，这样才会帮助他们健康成长。
