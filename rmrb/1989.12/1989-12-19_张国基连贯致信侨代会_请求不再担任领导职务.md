	Zhang Guoji and Lianhuan Write to the Fourth Overseas Chinese Congress
	Requesting Not to Assume Leadership Positions

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18 (Reporters Sun Yong, Zou Aiguo) Today, Zhang Guoji, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, wrote to the Fourth Overseas Chinese Congress, earnestly requesting that this congress not elect him as a member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and that the Fourth Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese not appoint him as a Standing Committee member or Chairman.

	Zhang Guoji was elected as the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese at the Third Overseas Chinese Congress held in 1984. He is now 96 years old. In his letter, Zhang Guoji mentioned that he had followed the Communist Party since his youth, participating in the democratic revolution. Later, he established educational institutions overseas and engaged in the anti-Japanese movement. In 1958, he returned to his motherland. Over the past 70-plus years, he has always harbored deep feelings for the overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and their relatives. Zhang Guoji stated that although he will no longer serve as the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, his heart for serving the overseas Chinese will not change, and his resolve to contribute to the revitalization of the motherland will only become stronger.

	Today, Lianhuan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, also wrote to the Fourth Overseas Chinese Congress, earnestly requesting that the congress approve his resignation from the position of Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, so as to further facilitate the new-old exchange within the leadership of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

	At today's preparatory meeting for the Fourth Overseas Chinese Congress, the requests made by Zhang Guoji and Lianhuan were met with enthusiastic applause from the 800 representatives.

    张国基连贯致信侨代会
    请求不再担任领导职务
    新华社北京12月18日电  （记者孙勇、邹爱国）全国侨联主席张国基今天致信第四次侨代会，恳请这次大会不再选举他为全国侨联委员，全国侨联四届委员会也不再推选他为常委、主席。
    张国基是在1984年召开的全国第三次侨代会上当选为全国侨联主席的，今年96岁。张国基在信中说，自己青年时期即追随共产党，投身民主革命，以后又在海外兴办教育，从事救亡运动。1958年回到祖国怀抱，前后70余载，始终对广大归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞怀有深厚感情。张国基说，今后虽不再担任全国侨联主席，但为侨胞服务之心不会改变，献身祖国振兴之志将更坚定。
    全国侨联副主席连贯今天也致函第四次侨代会，恳求大会批准他不再担任全国侨联副主席，以便进一步实现全国侨联领导机构的新老交替。
    在今天召开的第四次侨代会预备会上，张国基和连贯的请求博得了800名代表的热烈掌声。
