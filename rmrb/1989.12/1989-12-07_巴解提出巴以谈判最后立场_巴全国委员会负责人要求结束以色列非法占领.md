According to a report by the *Egyptian News*, Egyptian Foreign Minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali recently conveyed the PLO's final response to U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's Middle East peace plan to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.

The PLO's response was approved at an executive committee meeting held in Tunis in mid-November and was handed over to Foreign Minister Boutros-Ghali by PLO Executive Committee member Farouq Kaddoumi on November 21st.

In its final statement, the PLO reaffirmed its right to form a Palestinian delegation consisting of Palestinians both inside and outside the occupied territories to negotiate with Israel. The response stated that the PLO is prepared to cooperate with Baker's Middle East peace plan, but it should have the right to raise any issues at the negotiating table.

Meanwhile, it was reported that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs John Kelly said that the issue of Palestinian representation in the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue is still under discussion.

Kelly, in a statement after his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said that the U.S.-Soviet summit exchanged views on the Middle East issue, but no specific agreement was reached on the problems in the region.

    新华社开罗12月5日电　据《埃及新闻报》今天报道，埃及外长马吉德日前向美国驻开罗大使馆转达了巴解组织对美国国务卿贝克的中东和平计划的最后答复。
    巴解组织的这一答复是11月中旬在突尼斯召开的巴解组织执委会会议上通过，并由该组织执委会成员苏拉尼于11月21日交给马吉德外长的。
    巴解组织在最后的表态中，重申它有权把被占领土内外的巴勒斯坦人组成一个巴勒斯坦代表团去同以色列举行谈判。它在答复中说，巴解组织准备同贝克的中东和平计划合作，但是在谈判桌上它应当有提出任何问题的权利。

    凯利在同埃及总统穆巴拉克会谈后发表的一项声明中说，美苏首脑会议就中东问题交换了意见，但是并没有就这一地区的问题达成任何具体的协议。
