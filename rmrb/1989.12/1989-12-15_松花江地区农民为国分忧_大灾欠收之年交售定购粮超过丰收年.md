An inspiring piece of news has spread across the northern countryside—3 million farmers in the Songhua River region, despite facing severe droughts, floods, hail, pests, and early frosts that reduced grain production by more than one-third compared to normal years, have enthusiastically delivered their grain quotas to the state. The speed and quality of grain delivery have surpassed any previous years of bumper harvests.

Gold cannot buy such spirit. The remarkable feat along the banks of the Songhua River is due not only to the grain department's policy of no IOUs, immediate collection, and voluntary assistance in unloading and repairing vehicles, as well as setting up cost-effective dining halls, but also to the persistent efforts in promoting patriotism, collectivism, and socialism over the past year. This has ignited the broad masses of farmers to consider the bigger picture and share the nation's burdens. In all nine counties of the region, drums are beaten and banners are hung to clear the way for grain delivery. Many county leaders personally guide the first grain delivery, offering tea and meals to the farmers. Television, radio, and newspapers continuously propagate the importance of respecting farmers and prioritizing agriculture, praising the farmers' deeds. Meanwhile, various levels of government promptly deliver fertilizers and seeds to the countryside, organizing various industries to provide manpower, vehicles, and funds to support agriculture. The farmers are deeply moved: "The Party and government value us so much; we must support the Party and government with our actual performance in completing the grain delivery tasks!"

Many Party and Youth League members take the lead in delivering the first batch of grain, delivering high-quality grain, and fulfilling grain delivery contracts. In Shangzhi City, 5,119 farmer Party members have all completed their delivery tasks and additionally delivered 180,000 kilograms of grain to the state. In Tonghe County, all rural Party members have fulfilled their contracts, with 2,300 Party members completing their tasks 23 days ahead of schedule. Sheng Baocheng, who has served as a village Party branch secretary for over 20 years, called his son-in-law and son together, saying: "In the old society, I endured hunger and cold. Without the Party, there would be no me, and no you. Now we are better off, and we must not forget the Party. If you want to be filial to me, sell all the quota and surplus grain to the state." The old man's words moved the five households of relatives, who completed their grain delivery tasks within three days.

The rural cadres in this region have changed their past simple and rigid methods, learning to do detailed ideological work. Many work teams sent to the countryside are strict with themselves and kind to others, do not accept special treatment, help farmers solve various difficulties, work alongside farmers, and have heart-to-heart talks. Some even contribute money to help farmers with medical expenses and buy cotton clothes, winning the hearts of the farmers. The grain procurement work in the entire region this year has not encountered a single dispute.

### 松花江地区农民为国分忧  大灾欠收之年交售定购粮超过丰收年

    松花江地区农民为国分忧
    大灾欠收之年交售定购粮超过丰收年
    本报哈尔滨电　记者武培真报道：一个令人振奋的喜讯在北疆农村传开了——松花江地区300万农民今年在饱经旱、涝、雹、虫灾害和早霜袭击致使粮食比常年减产1／3以上的情况下，争先恐后地向国家交售定购粮，交粮速度和粮豆质量超过历史上任何丰收年。
    千金难买是精神。松花江两岸出现如此壮举，除粮食部门不打白条、随交随收、义务帮农民卸车修车和开办成本食堂外，主要是一年来坚持开展爱国主义、集体主义和社会主义教育，激发了广大农民为全局着想，替国家分忧的热情。全区9个县，到处为送粮大户擂鼓开道、披红挂彩。许多县负责人为送第一车粮的农民牵马引路、倒茶端饭。电视、广播、报刊连续不断宣传尊重农民、重视农业的道理，颂扬农民的事迹。与此同时，各级政府及时把化肥和种子送到乡下，组织各行业出人、出车、出资大力支农。农民大为感动：“党和政府这么看重农民，我们要用完成售粮任务的实际行动支持党和政府！”
    许多党团员带头送第一车粮、带头送优等粮、带头兑现粮食定购合同。尚志市5119名农民党员，全部完成交售任务后，又向国家交售18万公斤奉献粮。通河县农村党员全部兑现订购合同，其中2300名党员提前23天完成任务。当过20多年村党支部书记的盛宝臣，把姑爷、儿子叫到一起说：“旧社会，我忍饥挨饿。没有党就没有我，也没有你们。如今咱们好了，不能忘记党。你们要孝顺我，就把定购粮和余粮全部卖给国家。”老人一席话，5户亲属不出三天就全部完成粮食交售任务。
    这个地区的农村干部一改过去那些简单生硬做法，学习做过细思想政治工作。许多下乡工作队严以律己、和蔼待人，不吃优待饭，帮农民解决多种困难，和农民一起劳动、促膝谈心，有的甚至掏钱帮农民看病买棉衣，深受农民欢迎。全地区征购粮食工作，今年未发生一起吵闹事件。
