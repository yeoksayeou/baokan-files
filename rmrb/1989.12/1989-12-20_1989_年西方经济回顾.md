In 1989, the Western economy, if viewed from a short-term perspective, can be described as continuing to grow slowly. However, if examined from a medium to long-term perspective, structural imbalances remain severe. Major Western countries, while strengthening economic coordination, are also seeing increasing conflicts and competition among themselves. The momentum of economic growth has weakened, and the next recession is inevitable.

After experiencing the economic crisis of 1980–1982 in the capitalist world, the Western economy has been on a continuous upward trend for seven years from 1983 to 1989. In 1989, the growth rate is expected to be 3.3%, slightly slower than the 4.3% in 1988, approaching the average of the past 40 years since 1950. In 1989, the average price increase in Western countries was 4%, slightly higher than the 3% in 1988, but inflationary pressures are not significant. Exports increased by 8–9%, roughly equivalent to 1988. Domestic demand grew by 3.3%, less than the 4.6% of the previous year. The unemployment rate decreased from 7.3% in the previous year to 7.0%. The economic growth rates of Japan and the European Community were 5.0% (previous year 5.7%) and 3.4% (previous year 3.6%) respectively, both higher than the 2.5% (previous year 4.4%) of the United States. For the first time in seven years, the economic growth rate of the European Community surpassed that of the United States.

The seven-year continuous growth indicates that Western countries still have some adaptive capacity in accelerating technological progress, adjusting economic strategies, and improving industrial structures.

However, the aforementioned continuous growth does not indicate a change in the cyclical development law of the capitalist economy. The next economic crisis in the Western world is inevitable. In fact, the peak of this economic cycle has already passed in 1988, and the momentum of economic growth has weakened in 1989. Structural imbalances remain severe, and trade frictions will intensify.

Structural imbalances have been a heavy burden on the capitalist world economy throughout the 1980s, and in 1989, there has been little relief, with the situation remaining severe.

1. The federal budget deficit of the United States, which decreased from $212.3 billion in 1985 to $155.2 billion in 1988, did not decrease further in 1989, remaining at $152.1 billion. Considering that the amount used for paying national debt interest in 1989 reached $240.9 billion, social security expenditures were $227.5 billion, and the first major item of military expenditure increased to $294.9 billion in 1989, the room for further reducing the deficit is obviously quite limited. This is an important reason why some people in the United States recently proposed to reduce the military budget by a total of $180 billion over the period 1991–1997.

2. In the foreign trade of the United States, Japan, and the Federal Republic of Germany, progress in alleviating the severe imbalance in trade payments has been slow. Although the U.S. deficit decreased from $137.6 billion in 1988 to approximately $111 billion in 1989, due to the unfavorable development prospects of the net flow of service trade and investment returns, the U.S. current account deficit will continue to remain at the $100 billion level. Japan's foreign trade surplus for this year is estimated to decrease from $77.6 billion to approximately $70 billion; while the Federal Republic of Germany's surplus for 1989, according to economists' estimates in mid-November, will reach 148 billion marks, which, if converted at a rate of 1 dollar to 1.85 marks, amounts to $80 billion, higher than the $73.6 billion of the previous year. If the dollar exchange rate remains high, then Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany's surpluses will further expand in 1990. In this context, not only will trade frictions between the U.S. and Japan intensify, but frictions within the European Community member states are also inevitable. In fact, in May 1989, the U.S. already listed Japan as an "unfair trading country." Currently, the U.S. is considering making specific market demands for guaranteed shares.

3. The detachment between the scale of speculative trading and actual production value is increasingly widening. Following the stock market crash in October 1987, there was another, smaller, widespread decline in October 1989 (the New York Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 508 points and 190 points respectively). The background is naturally complex. However, speculation is undoubtedly one of the important factors. Currently, the scale of speculative trading in the world has exceeded the actual production value by about 20 times. Therefore, although Western countries have taken timely measures (mainly stabilizing the largest investment institutions and banks) and international coordination actions to calm the aforementioned two stock market fluctuations, any slight disturbance could lead to the recurrence of exchange crises and other shocks.

The trend of economic multipolarization is strengthening, with the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe in a stalemate.

The simultaneous development of global economic multipolarization and globalization is an important feature of the 1980s. However, in 1989, the trend of multipolarization is particularly evident. One of the most important substantive contents and objective driving forces is the further improvement of Japan's economic, financial, and technological status. As a result, the pattern of the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe's "three powers" striving to jointly dominate the world economy has become more prominent. In 1989, Japan's national gross product alone is already equal to the sum of the three major countries in Western Europe—West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom; it is equivalent to 60% of the U.S., but the total domestic investment of Japanese companies has already surpassed that of the U.S. (in the 12 months ending March 31, 1989, Japan was $521.4 billion, while the U.S. was $494.8 billion).

The European Community proposed in 1985 to build an internal unified market by the end of 1992, and its progress has been rapid since then. In 1989, it clearly passed the plan to implement the first phase of the European Monetary Union starting from July 1990; the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement came into effect in early 1989.

In this context, the relationship between the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe is increasingly shifting from "big brother to little brother" to one of both intense competition and necessary cooperation. The trends of intensifying contradictions and strengthening coordination are developing simultaneously. This reflects the simultaneous occurrence of the trends of global economic multipolarization and globalization of manufacturing and financial markets.

    1989年西方经济回顾
    裘元伦
    1989年的西方经济，倘从短期角度去看，形势可以说是继续缓慢增长；但若着眼中长期考察，则结构失衡问题依然严重。主要西方国家在加强经济协调的同时，彼此间的矛盾和竞争也日益加剧。经济增长势头已减弱下一次衰退不可避免
    在度过了1980—1982年资本主义世界经济危机之后，1983—1989年，西方经济已经持续上升7年。1989年预计增长3.3％，比1988年的4.3％有所放慢，接近1950年以来40年的平均数。1989年，西方国家物价平均上涨4％，虽然比1988年3％略高，但是通货膨胀压力并不大。出口扩增8—9％，大体与1988年相当。国内需求增长3.3％，不及上年的4.6％。失业率则从上一年的7.3％减少到7.0％。日本和欧洲共同体的经济分别增长了5.0％（上年5.7％）和3.4％（上年3.6％），高于美国的2.5％（上年4.4％）。欧共体7年来经济增长速度首次超过美国。
    7年持续增长表明，西方国家在加速科技进步、调整经济战略、改善产业结构等方面仍有一定的适应能力。
    但上述持续增长并不表明资本主义经济周期性发展规律的改变。西方世界下一次经济危机迟早不可避免。事实上，目前这个经济周期的高点已在1988年越过，1989年经济增长势头已经减弱。结构失衡依然严重贸易摩擦也将加剧
    结构失衡是整个80年代资本主义世界经济的一个重负，1989年也未见多少减轻，局势依然严峻。
    1．美国联邦政府的财政赤字，自1985年的2123亿美元降到1988年的1552亿美元之后，1989年不再减少，保持在1521亿美元。考虑到1989年用于支付国债利息的款项已达2409亿美元，社会保障开支2275亿美元，第一大项军费1989年增加为2949亿美元。这种情况，进一步压缩赤字的余地显然已经相当有限。这是美国最近有人提出要在1991—1997年间总共减少军费预算1800亿美元的重要原因。
    2．在美国、日本和联邦德国的外贸中，减轻贸易收支严重不平衡状况进展迟缓。美国的逆差虽从1988年的1376亿美元减少到1989年的1110亿美元左右，但由于劳务贸易和投资收益净流量的发展前景对美国不利，它的经常项目逆差将持续保持在1000亿美元的水平。今年日本外贸顺差估计将从776亿美元下降到700亿美元左右；而联邦德国1989年的顺差据经济学家11月中估计将达1480亿马克，如按1美元合1.85马克折算为800亿美元，高于上年的736亿美元。如果美元汇率继续高持，那么，1990年日本和联邦德国的顺差还将扩大。在这种背景下，不仅美、日之间，而且在欧洲共同体成员国之间，贸易摩擦加剧也不可避免。事实上，1989年5月，美国已把日本列为“非公正贸易国”。目前美国正在考虑对一些具体市场提出享有多少有保证的份额的要求。
    3．投机交易规模与实际生产价值之间的脱节日益扩大。继1987年10月股市暴跌之后，1989年10月再次发生幅度较小的普遍下跌（纽约道·琼斯工业股票平均指数两次分别下跌508点和190点）。背景自然错综复杂。但投机无疑是重要因素之一。目前世界上的投机交易规模已经超过实际生产价值20倍左右。因此，虽然西方国家通过及时采取措施（其中主要是稳住最大的投资机构者和银行）和国际协调行动，平息了上述两次股市动荡，但一有风吹草动，交易所危机之类的震荡将随时可能再现。经济多极化趋势增强美、日、西欧势均力敌
    世界经济多极化与全球化两种趋势同时发展，是80年代的一个重要特点。但在1989年，多极化趋势增强尤为明显。其最重要的实质内容和客观推动力量之一是日本的经济、金融和科技地位进一步提高。结果是美国、日本、西欧“三强”势均力敌、企图共同主宰世界经济的格局更形突出。1989年，日本一国的国民生产总值已经等于西欧三大国——联邦德国、法国和英国之和；相当于美国的60％，但日本公司企业国内投资总额已经超过美国（在截至1989年3月31日的12个月内，日本为5214亿美元，美国则为4948亿美元）。
    欧洲共同体在1985年提出了1992年底前建成内部统一市场的目标，其后进展迅速，并于1989年明确通过了从1990年7月开始实施欧洲货币联盟的第一阶段计划；美国与加拿大的自由贸易协定已于1989年初生效。
    在上述背景下，美国、日本、西欧之间的关系日益从“老大哥对小兄弟”转向既激烈竞争又必须合作。矛盾加剧和协调加强两种趋势同时在发展。这反映了世界经济多极化和制造业与金融市场全球化两种趋势同时在发生作用。
