At the recently concluded Strasbourg summit of the European Community, although some external opinions believed that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's European policy remained tough, local opinions generally praised Thatcher's "realistic" new attitude, even suggesting that this "may become a turning point for the Prime Minister to move closer to Europe."

At this summit, Thatcher changed her previous "combative" style. It is well known that at past summits, Thatcher would always "fiercely attack" the heads of partner countries without hesitation, and on issues such as the distribution of the Community budget and the Common Agricultural Policy, she never yielded. But this time it was different. Although she opposed the "Social Charter" and the monetary union issues to be discussed and passed at the meeting, she only adopted a "low-key" approach. On the one hand, she pointed out that deciding on matters related to entering the second and third stages of the European Monetary Union before the first stage comes into effect is "premature" and "unnecessary." Britain is not yet ready to fully join the European Monetary Union after next June, but on the other hand, Thatcher emphasized that if the Community decides to hold such a meeting at that time, Britain is also prepared to actively participate. Britain will continue to play a role within the European Community because "the European Community is Britain's choice."

Thatcher's new attitude made the heads of the governments of the countries attending the meeting overjoyed. The host of the meeting, President Mitterrand, led the applause for her speech, and German Chancellor Kohl also expressed his thanks for her "positive cooperative" attitude. Outside the meeting, some analysts recalled the scenario of 1985, where there was first a dispute, then agreement, and finally a consensus on the document of European integration, and predicted that Thatcher might reach a new compromise with the European Community at the last moment.

Margaret Thatcher, known as the "Iron Lady," has softened her tone on European policy for a reason. First, this is to respond to domestic pressure to adopt a more positive and constructive stance towards the European Community. The Labour Party has been criticizing the government's European policy, believing it poses a danger of making Britain a "semi-detached member" of the European Community. The call within the ruling Conservative Party to join the European Economic and Monetary Union as soon as possible is also very strong. Recently, Thatcher's leadership within the Conservative Party has been challenged, one of the reasons being the growing dissatisfaction within the party with her European policy. Secondly, Thatcher's new stance is to prevent Britain from being marginalized in Western Europe, so as not to lose its important position and broad market in Western Europe. As Spanish Prime Minister Gonzalez said, she "wants the train of European integration to slow down a bit, but does not want to get off this train." Thirdly, U.S. President Bush recently encouraged the European Community to accelerate the process of integration during his briefing to NATO leaders on the U.S.-Soviet summit, which is a factor she cannot ignore. In addition, some observers believe that, looking at the rapidly changing situation in Eastern Europe, Thatcher also saw the necessity of strengthening Western European unity.

Of course, whether Thatcher's relaxation and change during the European Community summit means a thorough change in her European policy remains to be seen. Britain's policy towards Europe has always been a major controversial issue. Those advocating that "Britain's future lies in Western Europe" and seeking to find a way to manage Britain's economy and maintain Britain's great power status through Western European unity are numerous and vocal; those who lack enthusiasm for the European Monetary Union are also numerous. Since 1973, public opinion polls have shown that British public opinion on the European Community has always fluctuated. But one point has become more apparent, as the newly appointed Foreign Secretary Hurd said: Britain has a "long-term plan" for building what kind of European Community from the perspective of the entire country. It seems that Britain will strive to build the European Community and will play a full role in the development of European unity, and this point is probably beyond doubt.

### 欧共体：英国的选择——玛·撒切尔首相对欧政策的新姿态

    欧共体：英国的选择
    ——玛·撒切尔首相对欧政策的新姿态
    本报记者　陈特安
    在刚刚结束的斯特拉斯堡欧洲共同体首脑会议上，虽然外界有舆论认为英国首相撒切尔夫人的对欧洲政策仍然强硬，但此间舆论却普遍称赞玛·撒切尔首相所表现的“现实主义”的新姿态，甚至认为这“可能成为首相向欧洲靠近的转折点”。
    在此次首脑会议上，撒切尔夫人改变了过去的“好斗”作风。尽人皆知，在以往首脑会议上，撒切尔夫人总是毫不客气地向伙伴国的首脑们“猛烈开火”，在诸如共同体预算分摊和共同农业政策等问题上，她是从不让步的。但这次却不同。尽管在会议要讨论和通过的关于
  “社会宪章”和货币联盟的问题上，她是持反对态度的，但只采取了“低姿态”。她一方面指出，在欧洲货币联盟第一阶段生效之前就决定关于进入其第二、三阶段的事项，条件是“不成熟的”，“不必要的”，英国尚未准备在明年6月后完全加入欧洲货币联盟，但另一方面撒切尔夫人则强调，如果共同体决定届时举行这样的会议，英国也准备积极参加，英国仍将继续在欧洲共同体内发挥作用，因为“欧共体是英国的选择” 。
    撒切尔夫人这种新姿态使到会各国政府首脑感到喜出望外。会议东道主密特朗总统带头为她的发言鼓掌，联邦德国总理科尔对她的
  “积极合作”态度也表示感谢。会外，有的分析家回顾1985年先论争、后同意、继而达成关于欧洲一体化文件的情景，并预测撒切尔夫人有可能在最后时刻同欧共体达成新的妥协。
      素有“铁夫人”之称的撒切尔夫人此刻在
  欧洲政策上松动调子，是事出有因的。其一，这
  是为了回答国内关于对欧洲共同体要采取更富有积极的建设性立场的压力。工党一直在批评政府的欧洲政策，认为它有使英国成为欧洲共同体“半分离成员”的危险。执政的保守党内部要求政府及早加入欧洲经济货币联盟的呼声也非常强烈。最近，撒切尔夫人在保守党内的领袖地位受到挑战，原因之一是党内对其欧洲政策日益不满。其次，撒切尔夫人此次更新姿态，是为了防止英国被排挤出西欧，以免丧失其在西欧的重要地位和广阔市场。如同西班牙首相冈萨雷斯所说，她“想使欧洲一体化的列车稍息一下，但不想离开这次列车。”其三，美国总统布什日前在向北约首脑通报美苏首脑会晤情况期间，鼓励欧洲共同体加速一体化进程，这是她不能不考虑的一个因素。此外，有的观察家认为，环视急速变化的东欧形势，撒切尔夫人也看到了加强西欧团结的必要。
    当然，撒切尔夫人在欧洲共同体首脑会议期间出现的松动和变化，究竟是否意味着她的欧洲政策有了彻底的转变，尚有待进一步观察。英国对欧政策历来是英国有争议的重大问题。主张“英国的未来在西欧”，希冀从西欧联合中寻求治理英国经济、维护英国大国地位者为数不少，呼声甚高；而对欧洲货币联盟缺少热情的也仍为数甚众。1973年以来的历次民意测验表明，英国公众对欧洲共同体的态度一直有起有落。但有一点已较明显，如同新任外交大臣赫德所说：英国已有一个从整个国家出发的关于建立哪一种欧洲共同体的“长期打算”。看来，英国将为建设欧洲共同体而努力，将在加强欧洲联合的发展中充分发挥作用，这一点大概是无可怀疑的了。
