The globally renowned field of Dunhuang studies has established a new branch—Dunhuang medicine. This new concept and its research findings, proposed for the first time by Associate Professors Zhao Jianxiong, Xu Hongda, and Wang Daokun from Lanzhou Medical College and Gansu College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, were recently approved in Lanzhou.

Since 1984, Zhao Jianxiong and his colleagues have conducted several in-depth studies in the Mogao Caves. They systematically verified, annotated, and compiled the medical and pharmaceutical content found in Dunhuang murals, Dunhuang manuscripts, and microfilm copies of Dunhuang documents scattered abroad. They discovered that the Mogao Caves contain many precious medical murals and rare early qigong illustrations. The caves also preserve partial copies of the classic medical text "Lingshu Jing," as well as fragments of "Xinxiugong Bencao" and "Shiliao Bencao." Additionally, they found a collection of lost ancient Chinese medical texts, including "Wuzang Lun," "Xuan Gan Mai Jing," and "Bencao Jing Jizhu," along with some prescriptions from before the Tang Dynasty. These classic medical texts, documents, and prescriptions are mostly original copies from the Tang Dynasty, closely resembling the original works. They provide new evidence for the collation of existing editions of classic Chinese medical texts. Some of the prescriptions have been clinically verified and shown to be effective, possessing high medical value. Based on these discoveries and research, they published the monograph "Dunhuang Medicine Essence," wrote 13 academic papers, and produced Dunhuang medicine slides.

Many domestic experts have highly evaluated the research findings of Zhao Jianxiong, Xu Hongda, Wang Daokun, and others. They believe that in terms of Dunhuang medicine research, this work is at the forefront domestically and also fills a gap in the overall study of Dunhuang studies.

    敦煌医学首次获得确认
    专家认为填补了敦煌学研究一项空白
    据新华社兰州12月5日电  （记者屈维英）举世瞩目的热门学科敦煌学，又确立了一门新分支——敦煌医学。这项由兰州医学院、甘肃中医学院赵健雄、徐鸿达、王道坤3位副教授首次提出的新概念及其研究成果，日前在兰州通过了鉴定。
    赵健雄等人从1984年起曾几次深入莫高窟，对敦煌壁画、敦煌遗书和流散在国外的敦煌文献缩微胶片中有关医药学的内容，进行了系统的考证、注释和整理，发现莫高窟中珍藏着许多极为珍贵的医学壁画和难得的早期气功导引画面。这里还珍藏着中医经典《灵枢经》的部分内容抄本和《新修本草》、《食疗本草》的一些残卷，以及一批早已散佚的中医古籍《五脏论》、《玄感脉经》、《本草经集注》等，并发现了唐代以前的一些药方。这些中医经典残卷、文献和药方多为唐代时的原抄件，接近原著的原貌，对中医经典著作现行本的校勘提供了新的依据。一些药方经临床验证效果良好，具有较高的医用价值。根据这些发现和研究，他们撰写出版了《敦煌医粹》专著，撰写学术论文13篇，制作了敦煌医学幻灯片。
    国内许多专家对赵健雄、徐鸿达、王道坤等人的这一研究成果给予高度评价，认为就其敦煌医学研究本身来说居国内领先地位，同时也为整个敦煌学研究填补了一项空白。
