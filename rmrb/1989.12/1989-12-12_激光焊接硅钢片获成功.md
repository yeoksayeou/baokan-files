Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 11th.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, in collaboration with the Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory, has successfully pioneered the use of laser welding for silicon steel sheets in China.

Silicon steel sheets are a core material in the production of electric motors. To meet the requirements of continuous stamping and cutting production, it is necessary to weld the sheets into rolls using lasers. This technology can reduce waste from cutting edges and corners. According to calculations, if this technology is promoted nationwide in the electric motor industry, it can save materials worth 36 million yuan annually.

    激光焊接硅钢片获成功
    新华社上海12月11日电  （通讯员吴英熙）中国科学院上海光机所与上海矽钢片厂合作，在国内首创用激光焊接硅钢片获得成功。
    硅钢片是电机生产中的核心材料，为满足连续冲剪生产的要求，需用激光将板材焊接成卷材。这项技术的应用，可减少因切割造成边角料的浪费。据测算，这一技术若在全国电机行业推广，一年节约原材料的价值可达3600万元。
