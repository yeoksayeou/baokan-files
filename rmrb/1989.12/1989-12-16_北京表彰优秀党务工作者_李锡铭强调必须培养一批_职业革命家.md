    Today, the Beijing Municipal Committee awarded certificates of honor to 612 outstanding party affairs workers from various fronts across the city and to 3,865 senior comrades who have been engaged in party affairs work for over 30 years. This is to commend their active contributions to the socialist modernization of the capital and to promote the learning and dissemination of their exemplary deeds.

    Li Sìmíng, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, emphasized the historical responsibility of party affairs workers in his speech. He said that China must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, resolutely follow the socialist path. This is the correct choice made by the historical development. At present, it is necessary to build various levels of party organizations into strong fortresses to defend the four cardinal principles and to resolutely fight against bourgeois liberalization. At the same time, in the new situation of reform and opening up, it is necessary to emancipate the mind, actively explore, and continuously improve the work of the Party, so that the excellent traditions and valuable experience of the Party can be better inherited, carried forward, and further developed in the new era and new situation. For this purpose, he also proposed the need to build a cadre team of party affairs workers that is compact, stable, and has relatively high political and professional qualities, and to cultivate a group of "professional revolutionaries" who are loyal to the cause of the Party.

    State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong attended the commendation meeting today.

    本报北京12月15日讯　记者颜世贵报道：今天，北京市委向来自全市各条战线上的612名优秀党务工作者和从事党务工作30年以上的3865名老同志颁发了荣誉证书，以表彰他们为首都的社会主义现代化建设作出的积极贡献，并要求学习和宣传他们的事迹。
    中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭在讲话中强调了党务工作者的历史责任。他说，中国要在中国共产党的领导下，坚定地走社会主义道路，这是历史发展作出的正确抉择。在当前，要把各级党组织建设成为坚强的战斗堡垒，捍卫四项基本原则，坚持同资产阶级自由化进行坚决的斗争。同时，也要在改革开放的新形势下，解放思想，积极探索，不断改进党的工作，使党的优良传统和宝贵的建党经验，能在新的时期、新的形势下更好地得到继承、发扬和进一步地发展。为此，他还提出必须建设一支精干的、稳定的、政治业务素质较高的党务工作干部队伍，培养一批忠于党的事业的“职业革命家”。
    国务委员、北京市长陈希同出席了今天的表彰大会。
