The world-renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa will be closed for three months starting January 7 next year to ensure the smooth progress of reinforcement work and the safety of tourists.

Pisa Mayor Granci signed the order for the temporary closure of the tower today. At a press conference held after the signing, he stated that if the reinforcement work on the tower cannot be completed within the stipulated time, it may reopen three months later.

The mayor had previously opposed the proposal. He believed that in recent years, the tilt of the Leaning Tower of Pisa had not significantly increased. Furthermore, the closure of the tower for three months would result in approximately $2 million in economic losses for Pisa.

Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in 1173, making it over 800 years old. The tower is approximately 54 meters high, with both the base and the body made of white marble. According to precise calculations by experts, the current tilt of the tower is nearly 5 meters, with an average annual tilt rate of less than 1 millimeter over the past 10 years. They believe that, barring any accidents, even without repairs, the tower will not collapse in the next 100 years.

    比萨斜塔明年初关闭3个月
    新华社罗马12月15日电　为了保证加固工作的顺利进行和游客的生命安全，举世闻名的比萨斜塔将从明年1月7日起关闭3个月。
    比萨市市长格兰基今天在有关暂时关闭斜塔的法令上签了字。他在签字后举行的记者招待会上表示，如果加固斜塔的工作不能按法令所规定的期限如期完成，3个月后可能重新开放斜塔。
    比萨市市长曾一度反对上述建议。他认为，最近一些年来，比萨斜塔的倾斜速度未见明显加快；此外，斜塔关闭3个月，将给比萨市造成约200万美元的经济损失。
    比萨斜塔始建于1173年，距今已有800多年的历史。该塔高约54米，塔基和塔身均由白色大理石砌成。据有关专家精密计算，该塔目前的倾斜度近5米，最近10年的年平均倾斜速度在1毫米以内。他们认为，若不出意外，即使不加修缮，该塔在今后100年内也不会倒塌。
