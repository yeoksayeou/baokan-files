The Second Asian Women's Weightlifting Championship Opens
China Team Wins Nine Gold Medals and Sets One World Record

SHANGHAI, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) — The second Asian Women's Weightlifting Championships began today at the Zhabei Gymnasium. Three Chinese athletes won all nine gold medals in three weight classes and set one world record.

Sixty-nine female weightlifters from nine Asian countries and regions will compete over three days on the 4-meter-square weightlifting platform. This afternoon and evening, 25 athletes from different countries competed in the 44 kg, 48 kg, and 52 kg weight classes. Each athlete fought fiercely for every kilogram.

Since the lighter weight classes are China's strong suit, Huang Xunqun (44 kg), Cai Jun (48 kg), and Liao Shuping (52 kg) each won three gold medals in their respective weight classes with significant advantages.

Cai Jun, in particular, started her snatch with 70 kg on her first attempt, just 5 kg short of the world record. After easily completing this lift, she attempted 77.5 kg on her second attempt. At this point, she was the only one left in her weight class. She successfully lifted the weight with ease, breaking the 75 kg world record set by Huang Xiaoyu of China in October 1987.

In the 48 kg weight class, Lee Young-hwa of North Korea won three silver medals for snatch, clean and jerk, and total. South Korea won six bronze medals in the 48 kg and 52 kg weight classes; Japan won three silver medals and one bronze medal in the 52 kg and 44 kg weight classes, respectively; India won one silver medal and two bronze medals in the 44 kg weight class; Indonesia won two silver medals in the 44 kg weight class.

    第二届亚洲女子举重赛揭幕
    中国队囊括九枚金牌超一项世界纪录
    本报上海12月22日电　第二届亚洲女子举重锦标赛今天起在闸北体育馆揭幕，3名中国姑娘一气囊括3个级别的9枚金牌，并超一项世界纪录。
    来自亚洲9个国家和地区的69名女大力士们，要在4米见方的举重台上比试3天。今天下午和晚上分别进行了44、48、52公斤级的比赛，25名不同肤色的姑娘个个“寸土必争”。由于小级别是我国优势项目，所以黄娴群（44公斤级）、蔡军（48公斤级）和廖淑萍（52公斤级）均以较大优势各自夺得本级别的3枚金牌。
    特别是蔡军，她上台抓举第一把就要了70公斤，离世界纪录仅差5公斤，轻松完成后第二把要了77.5公斤。这时，这个级别仅剩她一个人了，果然，又“轻轻地一抓就起来”，这个成绩已经超了我国选手黄晓瑜在1987年10月创造的75公斤世界纪录。
    朝鲜队李英花在48公斤级比赛中获抓、挺和总成绩三枚银牌。南朝鲜队获48和52公斤级6枚铜牌；日本队获52公斤级3枚银牌和44公斤级1枚铜牌；印度队获44公斤级1枚银牌、2枚铜牌；印度尼西亚队获44公斤级2枚银牌。（郑源镐）
