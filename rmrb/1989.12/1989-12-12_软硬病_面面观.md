Recently, when discussing the issue of being enthusiastic about economic work but lax in ideological and political work, people often quote a vivid phrase from Comrade Xiaoping: "One hand is hard, the other is soft." I admire this colloquial metaphor; it accurately summarizes the deviations in our work over the past few years and is thought-provoking. However, some people do not reflect deeply on this; in their view, this is only said to those leaders who bear important responsibilities—small officials are not in a position of responsibility, and ordinary people are even lighter, with no hard or soft to speak of.

I used to think there was some truth in the view that small officials and ordinary people have nothing to do with "two hands." However, after repeated reflection, I realized that those afflicted with this "soft and hard" disease are not just leaders!

If you don't believe it, let me explain:

You can recall some conference halls. The speakers there all speak eloquently, with each word weighing a thousand pounds, truly "hard"! However, when people follow up, they will find that these people who speak so firmly often do things in a weak and ineffectual manner, seemingly doing but not really doing. Have these people perhaps contracted the "hard-mouthed, soft-handed" disease?

You can recall some files. The long-term plans and short-term arrangements made at the beginning of the year, with detailed and meticulous plans labeled A, B, C, D, can be called "hard"! However, when checking at the end of the year, there are very few who can match the beginning and end, with actions that follow words and results that follow actions. Isn't this the "hard-headed, soft-footed" disease?

You can recall some offices. Some people treat the loss of state and collective property as if they were watching a fire from the opposite bank, remaining unchanged amidst countless changes; but when it comes to personal benefits, they always calculate meticulously and do not let go of even a fraction. Some even argue until their faces turn red. There are also some people who, when seeking positions, rigorously prove the conditions that benefit themselves without any ambiguity; but when it comes to their own work performance, efficiency, and integrity, they dodge and weave. Isn't this the "hard on the private, soft on the public" disease?

By analogy, it can be seen that the "soft and hard" disease is indeed varied, and its scope of infection is not limited to the range of leaders.

A wise man once said: Society is me, and I am society; you are in me, and I am in you. The ocean is made up of drop after drop of water, and polluted streams become polluted lakes. When we complain that our superiors have "one hand hard, one hand soft," we might as well think about ourselves.

### “软硬病”面面观

    “软硬病”面面观
    王映明
    近来，在谈到抓经济工作起劲，抓思想政治工作松散的问题时，人们常常引用小平同志一句很形象的话：“一手硬一手软”。我佩服这一通俗的比喻，它既准确地概括了近几年来我们工作的偏差，又耐人寻味。不过，有些人却并未由此而深思，在他们看来，这只是专门对那些负有重要责任的领导说的——小官既不在其位便不负其责，而老百姓更是无官一身轻，无硬软可谈。
    对这种小官和老百姓与“两手抓”无关的说法，我先前也认为不无道理。然而，当反复思考之后，才感到患上这种“软硬病”的，岂止是领导干部！
    君若不信，请听我一一道来：
    你随着记忆走进一些会场。那会上发言的，个个讲得头头是道，字字千钧，可谓“硬”矣！然而当人们跟踪下去，便会发现这些口气极硬的人干起事来，有些却常常是疲疲软软，似干非干。这些人，莫非得了“嘴硬手软”病？
    你随着记忆钻进一些卷宗。那些年初订下的长计划、短安排，甲乙丙丁，ABCD，详尽周密，可谓
  “硬”矣！可是到年终再对照检查，能首尾呼应，言必行、行必果者却寥寥无几。这岂不是“头硬脚软”病？
    你随着记忆走进一些办公室。一些人对国家、集体财产，损失千万若隔岸观火，以不变应万变；而在个人福利上却总是斤斤计较、毫厘不放，甚至闹得脸红脖子粗。还有一些人，在求索职务时，对自己有利的条件，严密论证，毫不含糊；而对自己的工作实绩、效率、廉政情况，则躲躲闪闪。这些，岂不是“私硬公软”病？
    举一反三，可见“软硬病”实在是形形色色，其传染面之广，并非只限于领导者的范围之内。
    有哲人说过：社会即我，我乃社会；你中有我，我中有你。大海来自一滴滴水珠，有污染的细流才汇成污染的湖泊。当我们抱怨上级“一手硬一手软”时，不妨也想想自己。
