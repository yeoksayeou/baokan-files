For a long time, Guizhou Province has been plagued by the vicious cycle of population, food, ecology, and poverty. Seizing the opportunity presented by the rectification and deepening of reforms, the province has mobilized all ethnic groups to focus on comprehensive management of population, food, and ecology, striving to transform the vicious cycle into a virtuous one.

Since liberation, especially since the reform and opening up, Guizhou Province has made significant progress in industrial and agricultural production. Fundamentally changing the long-term reliance on grain imports and financial subsidies has become an urgent desire for the broad masses of cadres and people in Guizhou. How can this goal be achieved? At a recent expanded meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, after several days of heated discussion, a resolution was formed: a firm decision must be made to concentrate efforts on the comprehensive management of population, food, and the ecological environment. The specific tasks are: by the end of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," control the natural population growth rate to around 14‰; ensure per capita grain availability of 250 kilograms, achieving basic self-sufficiency in rice for the entire province; and significantly improve the ecological environment, with a forest coverage rate of around 20%.

To achieve the comprehensive management goals, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have taken the following measures:

	Maintain the long-term stability of the household contract responsibility system based on family farming, and gradually improve it. Continue to allow and encourage a portion of farmers to become wealthy first through honest labor and legal operations.

	Increase agricultural investment. The province has decided to establish an agricultural development fund of 800 million to 1 billion yuan for rolling use. Local prefectures, cities, and counties will also gradually establish agricultural development funds. Ensure that each agricultural laborer contributes at least 15 days of labor to agricultural land construction annually.

	Rely on science and technology for agricultural development. Starting next year, all regions in the province will reform cultivation systems according to local conditions and widely promote hybrid seeds. Further encourage agricultural scientists to provide technical contracting, services, and training in rural areas. At the same time, gradually establish county-level agricultural science schools and training centers; vigorously develop collective and individual folk science and technology organizations, and strengthen the ranks of technological demonstration households.

	Strictly control population growth. In line with Guizhou's actual situation, resolutely implement the land system of "no additional land for increased population" during the contract period. At the same time, all economic policies formulated by the province should be conducive to controlling population growth.

	Strengthen leadership. The Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have broken down the comprehensive management goals to various regions, prefectures, cities, and counties, and even to districts and townships, ensuring implementation at all levels.

    提出目标　采取措施
    贵州综合治穷
    全力解决人口粮食生态三大问题
    本报贵阳电　记者潘帝都报道：长期来为人口——粮食——生态——贫困的恶性循环所困扰的贵州省，抓住治理整顿、深化改革的机遇，动员全省各族人民，集中力量对人口、粮食与生态进行综合治理，力促变恶性循环为良性循环。
    解放以后特别是改革开放以来，贵州省的工农业生产有了长足发展。从根本上改变长期吃粮靠调进、花钱靠补贴的状况，已成为贵州省广大干部群众的迫切愿望。怎样才能实现这个目标呢？在日前召开的省委扩大会议上，与会者经过几天的热烈讨论，形成了省委的决议：必须下定决心，集中力量对人口、粮食与生态环境进行综合治理。具体任务是：到“八五”期末，人口自然增长率控制在14‰左右；人均占有粮食250公斤，实现全省大米基本自给；生态环境明显改善，森林覆盖率达20％左右。
    围绕综合治理目标，省委、省政府采取的措施主要是：
    以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制保持长期稳定不变，并逐步加以完善；继续允许和鼓励一部分农民依靠诚实劳动和合法经营率先致富。
    增加农业投入。省里决定建立8000万至1亿元的农业发展基金，滚动使用。各地州、市、县也逐步建立农业发展基金。保证每个农业劳力每年投入农田基本建设的义务工不少于15个。
    依靠科技兴农。从明年起，全省各地因地制宜改革耕作制度，广泛推广杂交良种。进一步鼓励农科人员到乡村开展技术承包、技术服务和技术培训。同时，逐步建立县的农科学校和培训中心；大力发展集体、个体民间科技组织，壮大科技示范户队伍等。
    严格控制人口增长。结合贵州实际，坚决执行承包期内“增加人口，不再分地”的抑制人口增长的土地制度。与此同时，省里制定的各项经济政策，均要有利于抑制人口的增长。
    切实加强领导。省委、省政府把综合治理目标具体分解到各地、州、市、县直至区、乡，层层加以落实。
