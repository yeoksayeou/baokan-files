Title: Turning Arable Land into Markets is a Bad Deal

Recently, I went to the countryside and found that some townships and villages have enclosed arable land to build markets, with stalls set up inside. The smaller ones occupy tens of mu (approximately 1.65 acres), while the larger ones occupy several tens of mu. Some villages already have a large market every five days, but they still enclose a large market in the arable land outside the village.

It is understood that such large markets in arable land are not frequently used; they are only used for a short period after the harvest of melons and vegetables. For most of the time, they are idle, and the economic benefits are far less than planting crops or other economic crops in the field. Moreover, some villages do not even have enough goods for large-scale trading.

Some villages enclose markets in arable land to move the large markets from the streets. This practice is even more inappropriate. Holding a market on the street is convenient for the public, while enclosing a market in arable land not only wastes land but also causes inconvenience to customers. After Yanghe Township's Yanghe Village moved the market to a newly planned street, the number of people attending the market increased by more than 5,000, and the transaction amount on market days increased by five or six ten thousand yuan. It is clear that having the market on the street is better than in the fields.

I suggest that relevant departments take strong measures to curb the trend of enclosing arable land to build markets and save the innocent arable land that has been occupied.

    将粮田圈为市场得不偿失
    山东省青州市　王龙泉
    我最近下乡发现有一些乡镇、村庄把粮田圈起来，垒上柜台用做物资交易市场，小的占地十几亩，大的占地几十亩。有的村子里本来五天就是一个大集，可他们又在村外粮田内圈起一个大市场。
    据了解，在粮田内圈这样大的市场并非常用，只是在瓜菜收获后用一段时间，大部分时间空闲着，经济效益远不如在地里种庄稼或其他经济作物收效大，更何况有些村子还没有可供大量交易的物产。
    有些村子在粮田内圈起市场是想把在街上赶的大集挪出来，这种做法就更不可取。在大街上赶集方便群众，在粮田内圈市场，一来浪费土地，二来给顾客带来麻烦。我市阳河乡阳河村把大集改在新规划的大街上后，赶集的人比原来增加5000多，集日成交额比以前增加五六万元，集市设在街上肯定比在大田里好。
    我建议有关部门下大气力刹一刹圈粮田建市场之风，救一救被无辜占用的成片粮田。
