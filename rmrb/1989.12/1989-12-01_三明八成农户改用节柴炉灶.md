	In Sanming, a region of Fujian with a timber reserve of 117 million cubic meters, 80 percent of the farmers have now switched to fuel-efficient stoves. This change saves 560,000 cubic meters of wood annually.

	Previously, farmers in the Sanming timber region used traditional "tiger stoves," which had large openings and burners and were designed to burn whole logs. These stoves had an efficiency of only about 10 percent. Now, with the adoption of various fuel-efficient stoves, fuel consumption has been reduced by about 60 percent compared to the old "tiger stoves." Additionally, these new stoves are more hygienic and safer than the old models.

    三明八成农户改用节柴炉灶
    据新华社福州十一月三十日电　（记者孙静）在拥有木材蓄积量高达一点一七亿立方米的福建三明林区，目前已有百分之八十的农户改用节柴灶，一年可节约木材五十六万立方米。
    过去三明林区农户一直沿袭使用大灶口、大灶膛、烧整块木头的“老虎灶”，热效率只有百分之十左右。如今，改用多种节柴灶，比“老虎灶”节约燃料百分之六十左右，并且比旧式炉灶卫生、安全。
