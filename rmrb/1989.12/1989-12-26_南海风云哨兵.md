Reporters Liu Hui Nian and Huang Cai Hong visited the southernmost weather station in the country—Xisha Weather Station. Here, a group of young college and vocational students are active, and the fishermen of Xisha call them "sea gods."

In the office of the weather station, we saw a banner presented by the Central Meteorological Bureau hanging on the wall, which reads: "Sentinels of the South China Sea Storms." In recent years, the Xisha Weather Station has been commended by the National Meteorological Bureau twice. The meteorological personnel in the station come from seven southern provinces and regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, and Hainan. They are a group of college graduates and vocational school graduates, mostly around 20 years old. Five college students who came to the island in April this year wrote a couplet and pasted it at the entrance of the weather station: "Taking the island as home to detect storms, sharing hardships and responsibilities."

Meteorological observer Wen Zhan Chun graduated from a meteorological vocational school and was assigned to work at the Zhangshu City Weather Station in Jiangxi. He heard that the Xisha Weather Station needed people and actively applied to go to the harsh place. Just 15 days after his marriage, he gave up the comfortable city life and small family, bade farewell to his newlywed wife, and traveled thousands of miles to the Xisha Weather Station. Upon arriving at the weather station, he submitted his application to join the party, which he had written on the way, to the station leaders and voluntarily went to the most harsh Xisha Coral Island Weather Station.

Hu Xi Gen, who graduated from Chengdu Meteorological College, was originally assigned to work at the Jiangxi Provincial Weather Station. He also applied to come to the Xisha Weather Station and became the station chief of the meteorological radar station just one month after arriving on the island.

Yang Xiao Min, who graduated from Hunan Meteorological School, comes from a "meteorological family." His parents and siblings are all engaged in meteorological work, and he was assigned to work at the Changsha City Weather Station. This 24-year-old young man, who had never left his parents, voluntarily came to the Xisha Weather Station to undergo hard training.

In July this year, these college students experienced a strong typhoon in Xisha. The typhoon struck Yongxing Island with a wind speed of 50 to 60 meters per second. They wrapped themselves in raincoats and persisted in observing meteorological data and temperature and humidity at the observation points. The typhoon rolled them over the ground, and raindrops hit their faces like stones. To timely grasp the strength and movement speed of the typhoon, they braved the danger of being blown into the sea by the typhoon and went back and forth more than ten times to the observation points, obtaining first-hand data from the typhoon's center.

Station chief Fu Ding Lian happily told us: "The weather station is currently equipped with advanced instruments and equipment from home and abroad. It can not only observe and report various meteorological parameters of the South China Sea around the clock but also participate in global meteorological exchanges and data sharing. It provides timely meteorological guarantees for ships and aircraft from various countries passing through the South China Sea. The small weather station that originally had only a few people has now become a national benchmark weather station with two ground stations, one radar station, and one sounding station. This batch of new college students is indeed the backbone of our weather station. With them, our weather station is full of vitality!"

    南海风云哨兵
    新华社记者　刘回年　黄彩虹
    记者来到祖国最南端的一个气象台——西沙气象台。在这里，活跃着一群年轻的大学生和中专生，西沙渔民称他们是“海神”。
    在气象台办公室里，我们看到墙上挂着中央气象局赠送给他们的奖旗，上面写着：“祖国南海的风云哨兵”。近年来，西沙气象台两次获得国家气象局的表彰。台里的气象人员来自广东、广西、四川、江苏、湖南、湖北、海南等南方7省、区。这是一批有着大学本科和中专文凭的知识分子，年纪大多是20岁左右。今年4月上岛的5名大学生写了一副对联贴在气象台门前：“以岛为家探测风云，同甘共苦任重道远。”
    气象观测员温占春从气象专科学校毕业后分配在江西樟树市气象台工作。他听说西沙气象台需要人，积极报名要求去艰苦的地方。结婚刚刚15天，他就放弃了舒适的城市和小家庭生活，告别新婚的妻子，千里迢迢，上了西沙气象台。一到气象台，他又把在途中写好的入党申请书交给了台领导，并自愿来到西沙最艰苦的珊瑚岛气象站。
    从成都气象学院毕业的胡细根，本来分配在江西省气象台工作。他也申请来到西沙气象台，上岛一个月后就当上了气象雷达站的站长。
    从湖南气象学校毕业的杨小民，出身在“气象之家”。父母和兄妹都是搞气象工作的，他也分配在长沙市气象台。这个从来没有离开过父母的24岁年青人，为了经受艰苦的锻炼，主动要求到了西沙气象台。
    今年7月间，这些大学生们在西沙经受了一次强台风的考验。台风以每秒五六十米的风速袭击着永兴岛，他们裹着雨衣坚持到观测点仔细观察着气象数据和温湿度，台风把他们从地上卷着打滚，雨点像石头子一样打在脸上。为了准时掌握台风强度以及移动速度，他们不顾被台风刮下大海的危险，来回十多次去观测点，获得了强台风中心的第一手资料。
    台长符定联高兴地对我们说：“这个气象台目前装备了国内外先进的仪器设备，不仅可以全天候观测报告南海的多种气象参数，而且参加世界气象交流和全球气象资料交换，为各国来往南海的船只、飞机及时提供气象保障。当初只有几个人的小气象台，如今已成为有两个地面站、一个雷达站、一个探空站的国家基准气象台。这批新来的大学生不愧是我们气象台的生力军。有了他们，我们气象台就有了生气！”
