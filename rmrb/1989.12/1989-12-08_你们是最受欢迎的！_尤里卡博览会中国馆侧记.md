Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, December 2nd

On December 2, the 38th Eureka World Invention Expo opened at the Roger International Exhibition Center in Brussels. The expo showcased recent innovations in consumer machinery, chemical products, textiles, communications, photographic equipment, medical devices, small hardware, and sports and entertainment equipment.

The Chinese delegation, led by Kehua Technology Trade Co., was well-prepared. Since participating in 1986, the Chinese pavilion has consistently been one of the strongest at the expo. As in previous years, this year's ten Chinese exhibition booths were placed in prominent locations.

Since the opening, visitors to the Chinese pavilion have been continuous. Many have carefully inquired about the products and requested brochures. Several projects have already attracted preliminary interest from foreign businesses. The new type of polytetrafluoroethylene thin-layer lining anti-corrosion equipment from the Fluoroplastic Application Technology Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry has outperformed similar products from advanced industrial countries, attracting companies from West Germany and France for negotiations. The oil-water separator from the Shanghai Ship Equipment Research Institute has a lower production cost but a longer lifespan than similar foreign products, piquing the interest of a Belgian company. The multifunctional self-defense and fitness device and the multifunctional disease detection and automatic treatment device (commonly known as the "magic needle") from the Huaxi Electronics Research Institute in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, are small in size and easy to operate, making them suitable for home use. Both elderly and young visitors have come to try them out. An elderly Spanish visitor felt very good after receiving treatment on the first day and came back every day. His wife gave a thumbs up to the Chinese staff and said, "You are the most popular!" Many businesspeople have expressed their desire to be agents for this product.

The "Tianxian Pill," a new and effective drug for treating digestive system tumors from the Changbai Mountain Medicine Research Institute of the Jilin Anti-Cancer Association, has attracted the attention of a medical doctor from a research institute in Czechoslovakia. He formally proposed that if the Chinese side agrees, he will come to China next year as an official representative to cooperate with the institute in researching new anti-cancer drugs. A Belgian cosmetics company has shown interest in the Meiqi series cosmetics from Beijing and, after initial contact, proposed to conduct health inspections on these cosmetics in January. Businesspeople from Switzerland and Finland have also expressed their willingness to be European agents for these products.

Local newspapers such as the Evening News and the European Economic Alliance News have reported on China's "Tianxian Pill," new technology and products for bear bile, advanced goose down production technology, and high-level nutrition anti-wrinkle cream.

The word "Eureka" in Greek means "I have discovered." It inspires people to innovate in various fields, and only through continuous innovation can human life become increasingly perfect.

    “你们是最受欢迎的！”
    ——尤里卡博览会中国馆侧记
    王淑娟
    十二月二日，第三十八届尤里卡世界发明博览会在布鲁塞尔罗杰国际展览中心揭幕。博览会推出近年来在民用机械、化工产品、纺织业、通讯、摄影器材、医疗器械、小五金、体育娱乐器具等方面的新产品。
    中国参展团以科华技术贸易公司为主体，实力雄厚。自一九八六年参展以来，中国展台一直是博览会中的一强。像往年一样，今年中国的十个展台被安排在显要位置。
    自开幕以来，到中国展台参观的人络绎不绝，不少人仔细了解情况、索要产品说明书。有几个项目，外商已经开始与我国代表进行初步接触。化工部氟塑料应用技术研究所的新型聚四氟乙烯薄层衬里防腐设备，由于性能超过世界先进工业国家生产的同类产品，吸引了西德、法国的公司前来洽谈；上海船舶设备研究所的油污水分离装置，生产成本低，但使用寿命比国外同类产品要长，引起比利时一家公司的兴趣。陕西省西安市华西电子研究所的多功能防身健身器、多功能疾病探测自动治疗器（俗称“魔针”）体积小，操作简便，很适于家用，老、少观众纷纷前来测试。有位上了年纪的西班牙观众，第一天接受治疗后，自我感觉很好，于是天天来接受治疗。他的夫人翘起大拇指对中国工作人员说：“你们是最受欢迎的！”一些商人纷纷要求做这项产品的代理经销商。
    吉林省抗癌协会长白山药物研究所的“天仙丸”，是一种治疗消化系统癌瘤的有效新药。捷克斯洛伐克一家研究所的一位医学博士参观后，正式提出，只要中方同意，他明年就将以官派身份到中国，与该所进行技术合作，共同研究治癌新药。比利时一家化妆品公司对北京产的迷奇牌系列化妆品发生兴趣，经初步接触后，提出明年一月份先对这一化妆品进行卫生检测。瑞士、芬兰的商人也表示愿做此商品欧洲代理商。
    此间的《晚报》、《比荷卢经济联盟欧洲商报》对我“天仙丸”、熊胆汁新技术及系列产品、高级鹅裘皮生产新技术、高级营养防皱霜等参展项目均作了报道。
    “尤里卡”三字在希腊语里的含义是“我发现了”。它启迪人们在各个领域发明创造，人类只有不断创新，才能使生活日臻完美。
