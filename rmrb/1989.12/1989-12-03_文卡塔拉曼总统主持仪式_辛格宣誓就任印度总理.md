After Singh took the oath, Haryana Chief Minister and National Front leader, Janata Dal president Devi Lal, was sworn in as the Deputy Prime Minister. President Venkataraman presided over the swearing-in ceremony held at the Presidential Palace.

The 58-year-old Singh had previously served as the Finance Minister and Defense Minister in Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet.
