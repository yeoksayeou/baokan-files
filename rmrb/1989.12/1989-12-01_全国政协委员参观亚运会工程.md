This morning, Vice Chairpersons of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Kang Keqing, Ma Wenrui, and Qian Zhengying, along with more than 70 other members in Beijing, visited the construction sites of the Northern Suburbs Sports Center and the Athletes' Village Service Center. Vice Chairpersons of the Beijing Asian Games Organizing Committee Zhang Baifu and He Zhenliang reported on the preparations for the Asian Games.

The members first arrived at the Northern Suburbs Sports Center by bus and ascended a high bridge. This sports center includes a swimming pool, a comprehensive gymnasium, a track and field stadium, and a hockey field, and is expected to be largely completed by the end of the year.

Later, the members visited the Athletes' Village Service Center.

Most of the visiting members are elderly, but they showed great interest in the Asian Games projects.

    全国政协委员参观亚运会工程
    新华社北京11月30日电  （记者李贺普）今天上午，全国政协副主席康克清、马文瑞、钱正英以及在京的委员70多人参观了正在建设中的北郊体育中心和运动员村服务中心。北京亚运会组委会副主席张百发、何振梁分别汇报了亚运会筹备工作情况。
    委员们乘大轿车首先来到北郊体育中心，登上高架桥。这个体育中心包括游泳馆、综合体育馆、田径场和曲棍球场，年底可基本完工。
    随后，委员们又来到运动员服务中心。
    参观的委员们大部分年岁已高，但对亚运会工程表示了极大的关注。
