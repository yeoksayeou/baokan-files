The North Korean Committee for the Struggle to Release Lim Su-kyung issued a call today, demanding that the South Korean authorities immediately release Lim Su-kyung, a South Korean female university student who participated in the 13th World Youth Festival in Pyongyang this July.

This call was made by Ryu Yeon-gu, the vice-chairman of the committee, at a press conference held in Pyongyang today. He said that Lim Su-kyung came to Pyongyang as an official representative of the "National University Student Representatives Council" of South Korea to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival. Her visit to North Korea was entirely for the purpose of promoting Korean reunification. After Lim Su-kyung returned to Seoul via Panmunjom, the South Korean authorities immediately arrested her and put her on trial for allegedly violating the "National Security Law" and other charges. This completely goes against the fervent desire of all Koreans for national reunification. Ryu Yeon-gu stated that North Korea will continue to fight for Lim Su-kyung's release.

    朝要求南朝鲜当局释放林秀卿
    新华社平壤12月30日电（记者朱克川）朝鲜争取释放林秀卿斗争委员会今天发出呼吁，要求南朝鲜当局立即释放今年7月到平壤参加第13届世界青年联欢节的南朝鲜女大学生林秀卿。
    这一呼吁是这个斗争委员会的副委员长吕燕九今天在平壤举行的记者招待会上发出的。她说，林秀卿是作为南朝鲜大学生组织“全国大学生代表协议会”的正式代表来平壤参加第13届世界青年联欢节的。她来朝鲜北方访问，完全是为了促进朝鲜的统一。南朝鲜当局在林秀卿经板门店返回汉城后立即把她逮捕，并以违犯“国家保安法”等罪名对她进行审判，这完全违背了全体朝鲜人民要求祖国统一的热切愿望。吕燕九表示，朝鲜北方将继续为林秀卿获释而斗争。
