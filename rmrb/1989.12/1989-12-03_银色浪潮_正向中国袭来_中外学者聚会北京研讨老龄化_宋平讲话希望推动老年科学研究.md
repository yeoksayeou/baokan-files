The "silver tsunami," as demographers call it, is quietly sweeping towards the developing countries with large populations. This is the issue of population aging, which is increasingly drawing attention from countries around the world. Today, at a gathering of 70 Chinese and foreign scholars, Song Ping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, outlined China's plans: while vigorously controlling population growth, we must also prepare to face the challenge of aging and begin proactive research.

According to scholars, by the end of this century, when our country reaches a moderately prosperous level, it will simultaneously enter an aging society. This means that the population aged 60 and above will account for 10% of the total population. Facing this trend, social scientists are beginning the "Research on China's Elderly Population Survey and Old-Age Social Security Reform," a key project of the national social sciences during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The "1987 Elderly Sample Survey Data" has already been compiled and published. Song Ping referred to this as a result of proactive research, but more needs to be learned and borrowed from the scientific components and successful experiences of developed countries in this research. Through extensive academic exchanges, the in-depth study of gerontology should be promoted.

The three-day China Population Aging International Academic Symposium opened today in Beijing, hosted by the Population Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, with support and cooperation from the United Nations Population Fund. Mei Yi, Liu Zheng, Peng Peiyun, and others attended the opening ceremony.

    “银色浪潮”正向中国袭来
    中外学者聚会北京研讨老龄化
    宋平讲话希望推动老年科学研究
    据新华社北京12月2日电　（记者郭玲春、张孟仪）被人口学家称为的“银色浪潮”，已悄悄地向地球上人口积聚的发展中国家袭来。这就是为世界各国所日益重视的人口老龄化问题。中共中央政治局常委宋平今天在70名中外学者的集会上提出中国方面的部署：在大力控制人口数量的同时，必须准备应付老龄化的挑战，开始超前研究。
    据学者们预测：本世纪末，当我国步入小康水平的时候，也同时迎来了老龄化社会。就是说，60岁以上的老人将占到人口总数的10％。面临这一趋势，社会科学工作者们正着手进行“中国老年人口调查和老年社会保障改革研究”，这一列入“七五”期间国家社会科学的重点项目，目前已编纂出版了“1987年老年抽样调查资料”。宋平称这是超前研究中取得的成果，但还要吸取、借鉴发达国家在这一研究中的科学成分和成功经验，通过广泛的学术交流，推动老年科学研究的深入。
    今天在北京开幕的中国人口老龄化国际学术讨论会为期3天，由中国社会科学院人口研究所主持，并得到联合国人口活动基金支持与合作。梅益、刘铮、彭珮云等参加了开幕式。
