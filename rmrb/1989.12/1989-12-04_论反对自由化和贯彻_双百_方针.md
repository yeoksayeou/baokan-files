Every time the central government decides to launch a campaign against bourgeois liberalization, questions arise in the literary and artistic circles: Can the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy still be implemented? This time, after experiencing a political turmoil caused by the rampant bourgeois liberalization that nearly destroyed the achievements of decades of revolution, the anti-liberalization work in the literary and artistic circles has just begun. Some people are already impatiently asking: Should we still implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy?

This is indeed a strange logic. According to this logic, implementing the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, promoting the prosperity of literature and art, and opposing bourgeois liberalization are incompatible, at least they hinder each other: To implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy and promote the prosperity of literature and art, one cannot oppose bourgeois liberalization; to oppose bourgeois liberalization, one cannot implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy and promote the prosperity of literature and art. Those who raise this question, if they are not harboring ulterior motives, must be trapped in a double misunderstanding, both of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy and of opposing bourgeois liberalization. Clarifying this confusion is essential for truly carrying forward the struggle against bourgeois liberalization and for correctly implementing the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy to achieve greater prosperity in literature and art.

Any policy, as an expression of the management will of a certain state power and ruling party, has a social orientation and a specific social utility purpose. The "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is no exception. Free competition in creation and free debate in academia are the necessary paths to the prosperity of literature and art. This objective law has existed long before people recognized it. However, consciously utilizing this objective law to form a clear policy for managing literature and art, and even culture, is a great creation of the Communist Party of China and the new Chinese government. In other words, the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, as a conscious management policy, can only be a socialist literary and artistic policy, not a policy of any other nature. Mao Zedong, who presided over the formulation of this policy, clearly pointed out at the time: "The slogans of 'Hundred Flowers Blooming and Hundred Schools Contending' are not class-specific in their literal meaning," but the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy as a conscious management policy is our party and the socialist state power's policy for "strengthening the state and developing culture," and a policy for "promoting the prosperity of socialist culture in our country." Indeed, our party and the Chinese government formulated and implemented this policy not to develop cultural undertakings of other natures, but to develop socialist cultural undertakings, not to undermine or overthrow our socialist state, but to maintain and develop our socialist state. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has reaffirmed and further developed the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, not to change the nature of China's socialist cultural undertakings and the entire socialist cause, but to better build socialism with Chinese characteristics. If we forget or abandon this fundamental starting point, the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy will lose its self-identity and will no longer be a socialist literary and artistic policy. However, bourgeois liberalization fundamentally opposes the socialist nature of our literary and artistic undertakings and the entire state. Some advocates of liberalization arbitrarily oppose drawing the necessary boundaries between our socialist literary and artistic undertakings and Western capitalist literary and artistic phenomena. Some even openly deny the existence of socialist literature and art, demanding the abolition of the "socialist literature and art" concept repeatedly affirmed and used by the central government. Under the guise of "global village" and "going global," they advocate that the development of Chinese literature and art should take Western modern capitalist literature and art as the sole reference system and follow the path of Western literary and artistic development. At the same time, advocates of liberalization in politics propose that "the socialist experiment and its failure are one of the two great legacies of the 20th century," "persisting in the socialist path will only lead China into a dead end," "China is not to be liberated but to be dissolved," "we must take the capitalist road," and advocate "abolishing the Communist Party's dictatorship" and "implementing a multi-party system." Liu Xiaobo even shouted, "To live a human life, one must choose complete Westernization, with no room for compromise or integration," and that China's way out is to "be a colony for 300 years." The performances of the liberalization "elite" during the turmoil more convincingly exposed their goal of overthrowing China's socialist state power and turning China into a vassal state of Western capitalist powers. Therefore, in this fundamental sense, opposing liberalization will not hinder the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy but is a necessary condition to ensure that the socialist nature of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is not altered, thus truly playing its role in promoting the prosperity of socialist culture and strengthening the socialist state.

The "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, as a socialist literary and artistic policy, is guided by Marxism, just as all socialist policies are guided by Marxism. This does not mean that every writer, artist, or theorist participating in creative competitions and academic debates must be a Marxist, nor does it mean that the "Hundred Schools Contending" is a contest between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. As individuals, writers, artists, and theorists have the freedom to hold and express various views within the scope allowed by the constitution and laws. However, for those in charge of implementing the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy at various levels of literary and artistic departments, organizations, and state-funded literary and artistic newspapers, publishers, and for those leading and organizing creative competitions and academic debates, it is necessary to adhere to Marxist guidance. Because only the basic principles of Marxism can fundamentally reveal the laws of development of literature and art and the entire human society, only under Marxist guidance can different themes, forms, styles, and schools of creative competitions and different viewpoints and schools of academic debates be consciously and effectively guided to advance in the socialist direction, and only then can the results of competitions and debates, as Mao Zedong pointed out at the time, not "weaken Marxism's leading position in the ideological realm" but "strengthen it." In this sense, without Marxism, there would be no "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy. Without Marxist guidance, competitions and debates would only be spontaneous, or they would be led astray by erroneous thoughts. However, bourgeois liberalization fundamentally opposes Marxist guidance. Some advocates of liberalization slander Marxist literary theory and aesthetics as "closed," as "mechanical reflection theory" and "vulgar sociology," claiming that they only involve the "external laws" of literature and art and have not revealed the "internal laws" of literature and art, and thus are already "outdated." They slander Mao Zedong's literary thought and conspiracy theories as being connected, claiming that they are one of the ideological sources of the "Cultural Revolution." Moreover, the liberalization "elite" openly declare that the entire Marxist ideological system has been "feudal" since its inception, and now "the three parts of Marxism are all outdated and erroneous," and "Marxism has no use in today's China," claiming that "Mao Zedong Thought must be thoroughly criticized." They use every means to abolish Marxism's guidance over China's literary and artistic policies and the entire literary and artistic undertakings, replacing it with various non-Marxist and even anti-Marxist ideological systems. Our opposition to bourgeois liberalization and defense of Marxism's guiding position is precisely the defense of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy's ideological soul. How can it be incompatible with the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy? In terms of the actual content and results of competitions and debates, our opposition to liberalization is only against the wholesale adoption of entire ideological systems such as existentialism, Freudianism, humanistic psychology, sociobiology, and Western anthropology and cultural studies, which contain erroneous worldviews and histories, to replace Marxism's guidance over China's literary and artistic undertakings. It does not oppose borrowing reasonable and valuable things from these doctrines at certain levels and within certain scopes. On the contrary, it can ensure that such borrowing truly achieves the goal of using foreign ideas to serve Chinese needs, thus promoting the healthy development of literary creation and theory.

Undoubtedly, opposing bourgeois liberalization indeed restricts some people's "freedom." What kind of freedom is this? It is the freedom of a few people to violate the constitution and arbitrarily propagate views against the four cardinal principles, the freedom to arbitrarily alter and trample on the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, and the freedom to deprive others of their right to speak through various means. Under the encouragement, support, and incitement of Zhao Ziyang, a few "literary and artistic elites" of bourgeois liberalization, in their works, arbitrarily defamed China's socialist system and the party's leadership, defamed reform and opening up and modernization construction, and often declared that certain party committees or government agencies were "feudal clans" and "gang systems." Like the author of "River Elegy," they openly advocated that only the "blue civilization" of capitalism could save China. They were indeed very free, trampling on party discipline and state laws under their feet, but they did not allow others to have the freedom to criticize their works. Whoever criticized their works immediately labeled them with the hat of "obstructing creative freedom" and "beating people down." Some supporters of liberalization who controlled certain public opinion also not only did not propagate Marxism-Leninism but also did not allow others to propagate Marxist literary thought and Marxist basic principles. The pages they controlled, the various reports, seminars, and symposiums they held, actually became stages for competing in "complete Westernization." Whoever sang the highest tune of denigrating Marxism-Leninism received applause, whoever had the most "breakthroughs" in defaming China's revolutionary history and revolutionary literary history was hailed as a "new star," and whoever went the farthest in advocating "complete Westernization" could make the most headlines; on the contrary, whoever propagated Marxism-Leninism was ridiculed, and whoever talked about the fundamental differences between socialism and capitalism was denounced as "rigid" and "conservative." On the one hand, the liberalization "elites" did as they pleased, criticizing whoever they wanted; on the other hand, comrades who adhered to the four cardinal principles were actually deprived of the right to participate in free debates. At this time and under these circumstances, to hang the sign of implementing the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is not it a huge deception? Abolishing the "freedom" of a few people to trample on laws and monopolize the right to speak is precisely to ensure that the vast majority of people truly enjoy the freedom of speech guaranteed by the constitution; restricting the "freedom" of liberalization "elites" to oppose the four cardinal principles is precisely to defend the creation and criticism freedom of the majority of literary and artistic workers under the guidance of the "two for" direction; restricting the "freedom" of some supporters of liberalization to alter and trample on the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is precisely to restore the original appearance of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, so that it can be better implemented.

Yes, this opposition to bourgeois liberalization will also ban a batch of popular and famous "works." It seems that this will reduce the current cultural market's liveliness and prosperity, but in fact, it only reduces a harmful liveliness and false prosperity. For example, those "works" filled with erotic and even obscene content, which deliberately portray sexual psychology, behavior, perversion, abnormality, incest, rape, and homosexuality to pursue naked sensory stimulation, are lively enough. They are printed in tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of copies, filling the streets and alleys with bookstalls, bringing huge financial resources to publishers and distributors, but they seriously poison the minds and bodies of young people and also corrupt many adults, while also damaging the reputation of literature and art. Without "cleaning up," without banning these "works," can the people agree? Where will the dignity of the law be placed? Again, for example, some "political thriller" novels and so-called documentary literature arbitrarily fabricate and even deliberately seize some malicious rumors and materials provided by domestic and foreign hostile forces to exaggerate and defame the deceased party and state leaders and important cadres, portraying many of them as green-faced, fang-toothed characters, and writing China's revolutionary history (including socialist revolutionary history) as a pitch-black mess. These works are indeed very popular and become bestsellers in the market, but they greatly shake people's confidence in the party's leadership and socialism, having great destructive power in ideology and politics. Can a socialist state allow such anti-party and anti-socialist political propaganda to go unchecked? Can our literature and art use such things to create "prosperity"? These two types of "works," the former is the result of the rampant liberalization thought, and in turn, provides conditions for the rampant liberalization; the latter itself is a component of liberalization in the literary and artistic field. Banning such popular "works," removing these false prosperities, purifying the literary and artistic field's air, can just clear the way for maintaining and developing the true prosperity of socialist literary and artistic undertakings, better exerting the power of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, and achieving greater prosperity in literature and art.

The above does not mean that all specific work in the actual process of opposing bourgeois liberalization will not have problems and can be taken lightly. No, in such a complex country as China, any nationwide work in its actual implementation will inevitably have various shortcomings that need to be corrected in a timely manner. Opposing bourgeois liberalization is a highly policy-oriented work, and in its specific implementation, it is particularly necessary to pay attention to strictly grasping the policy boundaries, preventing simplistic approaches, preventing "leftist" things from rising again, and minimizing the possible losses caused by shortcomings in specific work. However, we cannot abandon the baby with the bathwater. Acknowledging that specific work in practice will not be perfect and opposing bourgeois liberalization and implementing the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy in a total sense are fundamentally different matters. In a total sense, only by persistently carrying out the work of opposing bourgeois liberalization for a long time can we ensure the smooth implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy and promote China's literature and art to continuously move towards new prosperity.

    论反对自由化和贯彻“双百”方针
    南海
    每当中央决定开展反对资产阶级自由化的工作，文艺领域总有人提出这样的问题：“双百”方针还能不能贯彻？这一次，在经历了一场由资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥所酿成的、几乎使我国几十年的革命成果葬于一旦的政治动乱之后，文艺领域的反自由化工作还刚刚在开始，有人就又迫不及待地提出：还要不要贯彻“双百”方针？
    这实在是一种奇怪的逻辑。按照这种逻辑，贯彻“双百”方针、繁荣文艺和反对资产阶级自由化是水火不容的，至少是互相妨碍的：要贯彻“双百”方针、繁荣文艺，就不能反对资产阶级自由化；要反对资产阶级自由化，就无法贯彻“双百”方针、繁荣文艺。提出这种问题的人，如果不是别有所图，那就是陷入了一种双重的误解，既是对“双百”方针的误解，同时也是对反对资产阶级自由化的误解。澄清这种思想混乱，对于真正把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争坚持下去，对于正确地贯彻“双百”方针、实现文艺的更大繁荣，都是十分必要的。
    任何一种方针政策，作为一定的国家政权和执政党的管理意志的体现，都带有社会倾向性，有着一定的社会功利目的。“双百”方针也不例外。创作上的自由竞赛和学术上的自由争鸣是繁荣文艺的必由之路，这作为一条客观规律早在人们认识它之前就客观地存在着了。但自觉地利用这一客观规律来形成一个管理文艺乃至文化的明确方针，则是中国共产党和新中国政府的一个伟大创造，也只有自身发展要求与历史发展客观规律的要求完全一致的无产阶级执政党和社会主义的国家政权才能明确提出并真正实行这一方针。换言之，“双百”方针作为自觉的管理方针只能是社会主义性质的文艺方针，而不是其他性质的文艺方针。主持制定这一方针的毛泽东同志当时就明确指出：“百花齐放、百家争鸣这两个口号，就字面看，是没有阶级性的”，但“双百”方针作为自觉的管理方针则是我们党和我国社会主义国家政权用以实现“国家巩固和文化发展的方针”，是“促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针”。是的，我们党和我国政府制定并实行这一方针，不是用来发展别的性质的文化事业，而是用来发展社会主义的文化事业，不是用来动摇、颠覆我们这个社会主义国家，而是用来维护、发展我们的社会主义国家的。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党重申并进一步发展“双百”方针，也不是用来改变我国社会主义文化事业和整个社会主义事业的性质，而是为了更好地建设有中国特色的社会主义。如果忘记、丢掉了这个根本出发点，“双百”方针就要失去自我，就不成其为社会主义的文艺方针。而资产阶级自由化则是从根本上反对我们的文艺事业和整个国家的社会主义性质的。一些搞自由化的人肆意反对在我国社会主义文艺事业和西方资本主义国家的文艺现象之间划分应有的界限，有人甚至公然否定社会主义文艺的存在权利，要求取消中央反复肯定并使用的“社会主义文艺”这一提法，他们在“全球村”、“走向世界”等口号的掩饰下主张我国文艺发展要把西方现代资本主义文艺作为唯一参照系，走西方文艺发展的路。同时，搞自由化的人在政治上提出“社会主义的尝试及其失败，是20世纪人类的两大遗产之一”，“坚持社会主义道路只能引我国于死胡同”，“中国不是要解放，而是要解散”，“必须走资本主义道路”，鼓吹要“取消共产党专制”、“实行多党制”。刘晓波还叫嚷“要过人的生活就要选择全盘西化，没有和稀泥及调和的余地”，中国的出路是“当300年殖民地”。自由化“精英”们在动乱中的表演，更无可辩驳地暴露出他们搞自由化的目的就是要颠覆我国的社会主义国家政权，把中国变成西方资本主义大国的附庸国。因此，从这种根本意义上讲，反对自由化不仅不会妨碍“双百”方针的贯彻，而且是保证“双百”方针的社会主义性质不被篡改、从而真正发挥繁荣社会主义文化和巩固社会主义国家的应有作用的必要条件。
    “双百”方针作为社会主义的文艺方针又是以马克思主义为指导的，正如所有社会主义的方针政策都要以马克思主义为指导一样。这当然并不意味着参加创作竞赛和学术争鸣的每一个作家艺术家理论家都必须是马克思主义者，也不意味着百家争鸣就是无产阶级和资产阶级两家争鸣。作为作家艺术家个人，作为理论家个人，在宪法和法律允许的范围内，有坚持和发表各种观点的自由。但是对于负责贯彻“双百”方针的各级文艺部门、团体和由国家出钱办的文艺报刊、出版社的负责人来讲，对于创作竞赛和学术争鸣的领导者和组织者来讲，则必须坚持以马克思主义为指导。因为，只有马克思主义的基本原理才能从根本上揭示文艺和整个人类社会的发展规律，只有在马克思主义指导下才能自觉地有效地引导不同题材、主题、形式、风格、流派的创作竞赛和不同观点、学派的学术争鸣沿着社会主义方向前进，才能使竞赛和争鸣的结果如毛泽东同志当年所指出的，不是“削弱马克思主义在思想界的领导地位”，而是“加强它的这种地位”。从这种意义上说，没有马克思主义就没有“双百”方针，离开了马克思主义的指导，竞赛和争鸣就只能是一种自发的东西，或者被错误的思想指导引入歧途。然而，资产阶级自由化则从根本上反对马克思主义的指导。一些搞自由化的人污蔑马克思主义文艺理论和美学是“封闭的”，是“机械反映论”、“庸俗社会学”，只涉及文艺的“外部规律”并没有揭示文艺的“内部规律”，因而早已“过时”，污蔑毛泽东文艺思想和阴谋文艺一脉相通，是导致“文革”的一个思想根源。不仅如此，搞自由化的“精英”们还公开宣布整个马克思主义思想体系从一产生就“带有封建性”，现在“马克思主义三个部分均已过时，而且错误”，“马克思主义在今日之中国没有用处”，声称“一定要彻底批判毛泽东思想”。他们千方百计要取消马克思主义对我国文艺方针和整个文艺事业的指导，用各种非马克思主义乃至反马克思主义的思想体系取而代之。我们反对资产阶级自由化，维护马克思主义的指导地位，也正是在维护“双百”方针的思想灵魂，怎么会与贯彻“双百”方针水火不容呢？从竞赛和争鸣的实际内容和结果来说，我们反对自由化只是反对照搬诸如存在主义、弗洛伊德主义、人本主义心理学、社会生物学、西方的人类学文化学等包含着错误世界观历史观的整个思想体系来取代马克思主义对我国文艺事业的指导，并不反对在一定层次上和范围中借鉴这些学说中的合理的有价值的东西，相反，它能保证这种借鉴真正做到洋为中用，从而促进文艺创作和理论的健康发展。
    毫无疑义，反对资产阶级自由化的确要限制一些人的“自由”。这是一种什么样的自由呢？是极少数人违反宪法、肆意宣传反对四项基本原则主张的自由，是他们随意篡改、践踏“双百”方针的自由，是他们用种种手段剥夺别人发言权的自由。在赵紫阳同志的纵容、支持、鼓励下，极少数搞资产阶级自由化的“文艺精英”，在作品中肆意丑化我国社会主义制度和党的领导，丑化改革开放和现代化建设，动辄就宣布某级党委或政府机关是“封建家族”、“帮派体系”，像《河殇》作者那样还公开宣扬只有资本主义的“蓝色文明”才能救中国，他们的确是够自由了，把党纪国法都踩到了脚下，但他们却不许别人有批评他们作品的自由，谁要批评他们的作品，立即就给你扣上“妨碍创作自由”、“打棍子”的帽子。某些支持自由化又掌握了某种舆论权的人，不但自己不宣传马列，而且不许别人宣传马克思主义文艺思想和马克思主义基本原理。他们控制的版面，他们把持的各种报告会、座谈会、研讨会，实际上成了宣扬“全盘西化”的比赛场，谁贬损马列的调子最高谁就受到喝彩，谁在丑化中国革命史和革命文学史方面最有“突破”谁就被捧为“新星”，谁在鼓吹“全盘西化”方面走得最远谁就最能出尽风头；相反，谁宣传马列主义谁就受到嘲弄，谁要谈社会主义与资本主义有原则区别谁就被斥之为“僵化”、“保守”。一方面是自由化“精英”们为所欲为，想批谁就批谁，一方面则是坚持四项基本原则的同志实际上被剥夺了参加自由争鸣的权利。此时此景还要挂上贯彻“双百”方针的字样，岂不是天大的骗局吗？取消极少数人践踏法律、垄断发言权的“自由”，正是为了保证绝大多数人真正享有宪法规定的言论自由；限制自由化“精英”们反对四项基本原则的自由，正是为了维护广大文艺工作者在“二为”方向指引下的创作自由和评论自由；限制某些支持自由化的人篡改、践踏“双百”方针的自由，正是为了恢复“双百”方针的本来面貌，使之得到更好的贯彻。
    是的，这次反对资产阶级自由化还要查禁一批颇为畅销和走红的“作品”。看起来这似乎削减了当前文化市场热闹、繁荣的程度，但实际上它所削减的只是一种有害的热闹、虚假的繁荣。比如那些充满色情乃至淫秽内容的“作品”，专门以欣赏的态度去表现性心理、性行为、性变态、性倒错、乱伦、强奸和同性恋，变着法儿地去追求赤裸裸的感官刺激，热闹倒是够热闹了，一印就是几万册乃至几十万册，摆满了大街小巷的书摊，给出版者和发行者带来了巨额财源，但却严重地毒害了青少年的身心，也腐蚀了许多成年人，同时还败坏了文艺的声誉。不“扫黄”，不查禁这些“作品”，人民群众能答应吗，法律的尊严又置于何地？又比如某些“政治黑幕”小说和所谓纪实文学，随意胡编乱造，甚至专门抓住一些别有用心的传闻和国内外敌对势力提供的“材料”来大加渲染、丑化已故的党和国家的领袖及重要领导干部，把其中许多人写成青面獠牙式的人物，把中国革命史（包括社会主义革命史）写成一团漆黑，这些作品的确也很走红，成为市场上的抢手货，但是它们却极大地动摇着人们对党的领导和社会主义的信心，在思想上政治上有着很大的破坏性。社会主义国家对这种反党反社会主义的政治宣传能听之任之吗？我们的文艺能用这种东西来制造“繁荣”吗？这两类“作品”，前者是自由化思潮泛滥的结果，又反过来为自由化的泛滥提供了条件，后者本身就是文艺领域自由化的一个组成部分。查禁诸如此类的走红“作品”，去掉这些虚假的繁荣，净化了文艺领域的空气，正好可以为维护和发展社会主义文艺事业的真正繁荣扫清道路，更好地发挥“双百”方针的威力，实现文艺的更大繁荣。
    以上所说，并不意味着反对资产阶级自由化的实际进程中的所有具体工作都不会出毛病，可以掉以轻心。不是的。在中国这样一个情况复杂的大国，任何一项全国性的工作在实际进行中都不可避免地会有这样那样的缺点，需要及时加以纠正。反对资产阶级自由化更是一项政策性很强的工作，在具体执行中尤其需要注意严格掌握政策界限，防止简单化的做法，防止“左”的东西乘机泛起，尽最大力量减少由于具体工作中的毛病而可能造成的损失。但我们不能因噎废食，承认实际的具体工作中不会十全十美与从总体上把反对资产阶级自由化和贯彻“双百”方针对立起来是性质根本不同的两码事。从总体上讲，只有坚持不懈地把反对资产阶级自由化的工作长期进行下去，才能保证“双百”方针的顺利贯彻，推动我国文艺不断地走向新的繁荣。
