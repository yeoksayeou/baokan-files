The Worries of Drinking Alcohol
Lǐ Ruìnóng

In recent years, China's brewing industry has flourished, with a variety of baijiu (white spirits) and beer flooding the market, enriching the lives of the people and providing the state with substantial fiscal revenue. However, while alcohol can invigorate the blood and boost spirits, it can also intoxicate and lead to decadence. Therefore, moderation is key. Perhaps more importantly, people should be aware that alcohol is a "big consumer" of grain. This primarily refers to baijiu and beer made from grain, excluding fruit wines.

According to statistics, China's baijiu production last year was approximately 5 million tons, consuming 12.5 million tons of grain; beer production was 6.54 million tons, consuming 1.5 million tons of grain. The amount of grain used for brewing is equivalent to the monthly ration for the entire population of the country, and it is increasing by 1 million tons each year. However, China is not a grain-surplus country, with per capita grain availability of only about 300 kilograms, including grain used for feed, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, China's population is increasing by over 10 million people each year, while arable land is decreasing by 600,000 acres annually, rapidly widening the grain deficit. This forces us to use scarce foreign exchange to import grain, with 15 million tons imported last year, almost equivalent to the grain consumed by the brewing industry.

Alcohol, if consumed at this rate, is unsustainable! Flipping through newspapers and magazines, there are numerous wine-tasting events and alcohol culture festivals, along with various literary works that glorify drinking, all of which fuel people's alcohol consumption psychology. Phrases like "no alcohol, no banquet" and "drink until intoxicated" have become fashionable. However, all of this ignores our national conditions.

The central government has already stipulated that banquets should not serve baijiu. Measures to curb beer production and consumption should also be considered. Currently, we should also consider developing new types of alcohol, such as fruit wines, and adjusting the structure of brewing raw materials. This approach is suitable for our national conditions and aligns with the current need for rectification and order.

    饮酒之忧
    李瑞农
    近年来，我国酿酒工业大兴，丰富多样的白酒、啤酒纷纷走向市场，调剂了人民群众的生活，也为国家提供了大量的财政收入。但酒这东西虽然可以活血、提神，却也能使人麻醉、颓废，所以，需讲个适量。不过，也许更应该引起人们重视的是，酒这个“大耗子”在与人们争粮食。当然，这里主要指以粮食为原料的白酒、啤酒，果类酒不在此列。
    据统计，我国去年白酒产量约500万吨，耗费粮食1250万吨；啤酒产量654万吨，耗费粮食150万吨。酿酒用量相当于挤掉全国人口一个月的口粮，而且每年正以100万吨的速度递增。但我国却不是个粮食富余国，人均粮食只有300多公斤，其中还包括饲料、食品、医药等工业大量用粮。不仅如此，我国人口以每年1000多万人的速度递增，而耕地却以每年600万亩的速度减少，急剧地拉大了我国粮食的缺口，迫使我们抽取紧张的外汇去进口粮食，仅去年就进口1500万吨，而这恰恰几乎相当于酿酒所耗粮食。
    酒，这么喝下去，怎么得了！再翻翻报纸杂志，评酒会名目繁多，酒文化节轰轰烈烈，又加上各种文艺作品对饮酒的渲染，都助长着人们的酒消费心理，“无酒不成席”、“一醉方休”一时成为时尚。可这一切都忘了我们的国情。
    中央已规定宴席不上白酒。啤酒的生产和消费似乎也应该有遏制的措施。眼下，还应考虑开发酒类新品种，如果类酒等，调整酿酒原料的结构。这样做，才适合我们的国情，也符合当前治理整顿工作的需要。
