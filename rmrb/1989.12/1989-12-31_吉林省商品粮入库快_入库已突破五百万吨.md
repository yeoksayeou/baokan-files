    Grain procurement in Jilin Province, which has suffered severe natural disasters, has been unexpectedly swift. By December 28, a total of 506 million metric tons of grain had been procured for state purchase and negotiated purchase. A farmer from Dongfeng County, who recently passed away due to illness, instructed his family in his final moments to ensure that the contracted grain was delivered to the state on time and in full.

    Currently, most counties (cities) in the province have completed or are close to completing their state grain procurement tasks.

    吉林省商品粮入库快
    入库已突破五百万吨
    据新华社长春十二月三十日电　（记者范向群）遭受严重自然灾害的吉林省，商品粮入库之快出乎人们预料。到十二月二十八日，国家定购和议购粮食共计入库五百○六万吨。东丰县一位农民，不久前不幸病逝。在弥留之际，他还嘱托亲人一定要把定购粮如数按期交售给国家。
    目前，全省多数县（市）完成或接近完成国家定购粮任务。
