	State Invention Award

	The State Council promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Awarding of Science and Technology Inventions" in December 1978. This is the "State Invention Award."

	The regulations stipulate that any science and technology invention project submitted for selection and approval must meet the following three conditions: first, it must be novel; second, it must be advanced; third, it must be proven through practice to be applicable. Projects that meet these conditions can be submitted to the relevant departments of the State Council and local science and technology commissions for application and review. The State Science and Technology Commission will then approve and issue the awards. Particularly significant inventions may be listed as special awards and awarded separately.

	The award is divided into four grades, with corresponding honors (medals) and prize money. The awardees can be Chinese citizens, overseas Chinese, or foreign nationals.

	Natural Science Award

	China promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Awarding of Natural Science" in 1982.

	The regulations stipulate that collective or individual scientific research achievements that elucidate the phenomena, characteristics, or laws of nature and have significant importance in the development of science and technology can be awarded this prize.

	The award is divided into four grades, with corresponding honors and prize money. Particularly significant achievements can be awarded a special grade, with separate awards.

	Research institutions, universities, national academic organizations, and groups of ten or more science and technology workers at the level of associate researcher or above can recommend projects for the award. The projects are initially reviewed by the relevant departments of the state, which then propose the award grades. The State Science and Technology Commission will make the final approval and lead the awarding process.

	The regulations also stipulate that overseas Chinese and foreign nationals who have made outstanding contributions to the development of China's scientific undertakings can also be awarded.

	State Science and Technology Progress Award

	China formulated and promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Awarding of Science and Technology Progress" in September 1984. Since its promulgation and implementation, it has undergone three rounds of evaluations, awarding a total of 3,082 projects. The award is divided into four grades, with a special award category. Chinese and foreign nationals who have made significant contributions to China's science and technology progress can be awarded.
