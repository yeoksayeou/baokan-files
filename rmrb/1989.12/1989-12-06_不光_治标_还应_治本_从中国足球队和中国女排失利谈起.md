The Chinese football team's attempt to "break out of Asia" in the World Cup qualifying rounds has once again failed. The Chinese women's volleyball team also only managed to secure third place in the World Cup women's volleyball tournament. Many fans, while feeling disappointed, also console themselves by saying, "That's just their level." However, one cannot help but ask: Why, despite numerous efforts, has the Chinese football team still not succeeded? Why, after several adjustments, is the Chinese women's volleyball team still not as strong as before?

Let's look at the path the Chinese football team has taken over the past decade: The coaches have changed several times, the team has been reorganized multiple times, and even veteran players who have been playing abroad for a long time have been called back to "strengthen the team."

As for the Chinese women's volleyball team, they have been plagued by a lack of "elite" players for years. Bringing back old players who had already left the team is also a last-minute measure.

Looking at the national situation, the total number of players in the national, second-tier, and youth football teams across the country is at most a few thousand. Moreover, their level is not high, and many matches have very few spectators. Those "football towns," football tradition schools, and youth amateur football teams have also shown signs of "running out of steam" in recent years.

The situation in women's volleyball is also not good. The tasks of the national first-tier women's volleyball teams seem to be only two: to compete for the national championship and to supply players to the national team. However, once the key players of these teams are taken by the national team, the entire team will suffer a significant setback and will also fall into the dilemma of having no successors.

In summary, it shows that the "professionalization" path that has been followed for decades indeed needs reform. It also indicates that to quickly improve the level of football and women's volleyball in our country, relying solely on "treating the symptoms" is no longer sufficient to adapt to the rapid development of these two sports worldwide.

So, where is the path to "treating the root cause"? I believe that we should fully utilize the existing sports facilities across the country and develop football and women's volleyball in primary, middle, and high schools in a solid manner. At the same time, we should make some "surgery" in the competition and training systems at all levels to adapt to the new trends in the development of football and volleyball worldwide.

Imagine, if our country had tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of "football population" and "women's volleyball population," the level would naturally rise. At that time, why worry about the continuous emergence of "elite" players!

Of course, this does not mean that the current Chinese football team and Chinese women's volleyball team have no hope, or that they no longer need to "treat the symptoms." "Symptoms" still need to be treated, and moreover, they are in an upward stage with great development potential, especially the Chinese women's volleyball team, as overseas volleyball commentators have said: "The new lineup of the Chinese women's volleyball team has hope." It's just that their task of "treating the symptoms" is more arduous. Because their past foundation is not very solid, they still need to refine their physical fitness, basic skills, tactical awareness, mental toughness, and major competition experience.

Emphasizing "treating the root cause" is only to hope that in the future, when the Chinese football team and the Chinese women's volleyball team "change blood," many "new stars" will automatically emerge, pushing the old players off the stage and forming a natural elimination situation.

To "treat the root cause," of course, there will be various difficulties. But the sports industry has never been just the responsibility of the sports leadership departments and education leadership departments. It needs the concern and support of the entire society. With the concern and support of the entire society, many problems will be solved. Currently, we can fully take advantage of the momentum of hosting the Asian Games to push forward the sports activities of young people.

    不光“治标”还应“治本”
    ——从中国足球队和中国女排失利谈起
    中国足球队在世界杯外围赛中“冲出亚洲”的尝试再次失败，中国女排在世界杯女排赛中也仅取得第三名。许多球迷在感到惋惜之余，也自解曰：也就这水平。然而，人们不禁要问：为什么中国足球队几经努力，仍不成功；中国女排几次调整，水平仍不如前？
    且看中国足球队近十年来所走过的道路：教练员几次易人，队伍多次调整，甚至需要把已长期到国外踢球的老队员召回“加强实力”。
    中国女排呢？她们几年来一直受到缺乏“尖子”队员的困扰。而把早已离队的老队员又召回效力，这也属“临急抱佛脚”的措施。
    再看看全国情况。全国的甲级、乙级和青年足球队人数的总和，充其量不过数千而已。况且他们的水平也不甚高，许多场比赛都是观众寥寥。而那些“足球之乡”、足球传统学校和少年业余体校足球队等，近年来也有点“后劲不足”。
    女排运动的情况也不妙。那些全国甲级女排的任务似乎只有两个，即争夺全国冠军和向国家队输送人才。可是，这些队的主力队员一旦被国家队调走，全队立即会元气大伤，而且也同样会陷入后继乏人的困境。
    综上所述，表明已经走惯了几十年的“专业化”道路，实有改革的必要了。同时也说明，要想尽快提高我国足球运动和女排运动的水平，光靠“治标”，已难以适应世界这两项运动迅猛发展的客观形势了。
    那么，“治本”的途径在哪里呢？我认为，充分利用全国各地现有的体育设施，把青少年，或者更确切地说，把大、中、小学的足球运动和女排运动扎扎实实地开展起来。同时，在各级竞赛、训练体制上都相应动一番“手术”，以适应世界足球、排球不断发展的新趋势。
    试想，如果我国拥有几十万甚至上百万“足球人口”和“女排人口”，水涨船高，届时何愁“尖子”队员不会源源不断地涌现！
    当然，这里绝不是说，目前中国足球队和中国女排已无希望了，或者说不需要再“治标”了。“标”，还是要治的，况且他们正处于上升阶段，发展潜力还很大，特别是中国女排，正像海外排坛评论家所说：“中国女排新阵容有希望”。只是他们“治标”的任务更加艰巨罢了。因为他们过去的基础打得还不太好，所以还需要在体能、基本功、战术意识、心理素质、大赛经验等方面再精雕细刻一番。
    而强调“治本”，只是希望中国足球队和中国女排将来再“换血”时，能有众多的“新星”“自动”冒出来，把老队员“挤”下台，形成自然淘汰的大好局面。
    要“治本”，当然会遇到各种困难。但体育事业从来不仅仅是体育领导部门和教育领导部门的事。它需要全社会的关心和支持。有了全社会的关心和支持，许多问题都会迎刃而解。就当前而言，我们完全可以乘举办亚运会这一东风，把青少年的体育活动也向前推进一步。
