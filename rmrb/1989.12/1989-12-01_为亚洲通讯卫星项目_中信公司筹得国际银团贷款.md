	China International Trust and Investment Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hong Kong Shortridge Company, signed a syndicated loan agreement today in Hong Kong with multiple international banks. The loan will be used for the AsiaSat 1 communication satellite project.

	AsiaSat 1 is a joint venture between China International Trust and Investment Corporation, Cable & Wireless of the United Kingdom, and the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company. The satellite will be purchased from the United States and is scheduled to be launched by China's Long March 3 rocket in April of next year. This $50 million syndicated loan was arranged by the Bank of America and includes nine banks from the Middle East, Canada, West Germany, France, Austria, Finland, and Hong Kong. The loan will be used as part of the funds invested by China International Trust and Investment Corporation in this project.

	During the signing ceremony, Bank of America's Asia Manager, Guo Yan, stated that the formation of this syndicate was very successful, with the subscribed amount exceeding 60% of the total loan amount. This shows that the international financial community has a strong interest in high-quality Chinese loan projects.
