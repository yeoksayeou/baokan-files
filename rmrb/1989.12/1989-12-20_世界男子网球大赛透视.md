The Davis Cup matches held from December 15 to 17 provided a glimpse into the world of men's tennis in the 1990s. Experts analyze that, compared to other countries, the men's tennis teams of the Federal Republic of Germany and Sweden are slightly stronger. The basic pattern for next year will likely remain a contest between two powers.

In last year's world tennis tournaments, Czechoslovakia's Lendl won three gold medals in the four major tournaments. This year, however, it was "Becker's year." In the four major tournaments, except for the Australian Open and the French Open, which were won by Lendl and Zhang Depei, Becker took home the titles for Wimbledon and the US Open. This silenced the criticisms that he "can play on grass but not on hard courts" and that he "plays well abroad but not at home." Becker's serve, return, and self-adjustment abilities have significantly improved over the year, earning him praise from the tennis world. Becker's main rival next year will still be Lendl.

Although Lendl only won one gold medal in the four major tournaments this year, he still had notable achievements in other major and minor tournaments. Lendl ranked first in the world this year, earning a total of $2.34 million in prize money, setting a new record in tennis history.

The player with the most charming on-court demeanor, Edberg, was the "un-crowned king" in the four major tournaments this year. Although he has records of defeating Becker in other tournaments, for the 23-year-old Edberg, not only next year but perhaps throughout the 1990s, the 22-year-old Becker will be a formidable competitor.

There will be 80 world-class men's tennis tournaments next year. Players, in order to improve their rankings and earn prize money, will be busy participating in tournaments, with little time for rest. The call to reform the current men's professional tennis tournament evaluation methods and competition procedures is growing louder. People hope that through reform, it will not only benefit the growth of the players but also allow audiences to enjoy high-quality, high-level competitions.

    世界男子网球大赛透视
    本报记者　于青
    12月15日至17日举行的戴维斯杯赛后，作为80年代世界网球比赛的最后一幕，为人们展望90年代男子网坛提供了一些参考系数。行家分析，当今世界各国男网团体实力相比，联邦德国和瑞典略高一筹，明年的基本格局还将是两雄相争。
    去年的世界网球赛中，捷克斯洛伐克的伦德尔在四大赛中夺走了三枚金牌，今年则是“贝克尔年”。四大赛事，除澳大利亚锦标赛和法国公开赛被伦德尔和张德培夺魁外，温布尔登和美国公开赛的桂冠皆属贝克尔一人，使说他“能打草地，打不好硬地”，“在国外打得好，在家门口打不好”的议论自消自灭。贝克尔的发球、接发球技术，以及自我调节能力在一年内的显著进步令网球界赞叹。明年贝克尔的主要对手仍是伦德尔。
    伦德尔虽然今年在四大赛中只得一枚金牌，但在其他大小比赛中仍颇有建树。今年世界网球他排名第一位，本年度参赛共获奖金234万美元，创下网球史上最高纪录。
    场上风度最令人倾倒的埃德博格，今年在四大赛中是“无冕之王”，其他比赛中虽有战胜贝克尔的纪录，但对于23岁的他来说，不仅明年，或许在整个90年代，22岁的贝克尔都将是他的有力竞争对手。
    明年的世界性男子网球比赛有80次之多。选手们为提高名次获取奖金，将疲于奔命地参加比赛，难以得到休整时机。改革现有男子职业网球比赛评议方法和比赛程序的呼声日益增高。人们期待通过改革，既有利于选手们的成长，也能使观众欣赏到高质量、高水平的比赛。
