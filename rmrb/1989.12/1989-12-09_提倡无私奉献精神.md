Advocating the Spirit of Selfless Dedication

The million-strong geology workforce of our country has long been toiling in the depths of mountains, deserts, and remote valleys. Their footsteps have covered every inch of our nation's territory, except for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

The work of geology team members is far from urban areas, away from their families, enduring hardships, and facing the elements. The ravages of nature not only bring them difficulties but also frequently put their lives in danger. However, for the prosperity of the motherland, they are brave and enterprising, constantly exploring, and remain steadfast in their resolve. Their contributions are immense. Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, every yuan of geological exploration investment by the state has, through their labor, brought about 13 yuan in mining output value; further bringing about 80 yuan in related industrial output value and nearly 200 yuan in national income. Looking across the vast expanse of China, every high furnace standing tall and every new industrial city rising up is inextricably linked to the pioneering work of the geology workforce.

On the journey of reform and opening up, we face many difficulties that need to be overcome and many tasks that need to be accomplished. This requires us to learn from the noble qualities of geology workers—putting hardship first and enjoyment last; striving hard and dedicating themselves selflessly.

    提倡无私奉献精神
    我国百万地质大军长年奋战在深山大漠、荒野幽谷中。他们的足迹已遍及除港、澳、台之外的每一寸国土。
    地质队员的工作远离城市，别离家庭，风餐露宿，栉风沐雨。大自然的肆虐，不仅给他们带来困难，而且还经常有生命危险。但是，为了祖国的富强，他们勇于进取，不断探索，“衣带渐宽终不悔”。他们的奉献是巨大的。建国40年来，国家的每一元地勘费投入，经过他们的劳动，相应带来13元矿业产值；进而带来80元相关的工业产值和近200元的国民收入。遍观中华大地一个个高炉矗立，一座座工矿新城崛起，无不和地质大军的开拓性劳动有关。
    在改革开放的征途中，我们有许多困难需要克服，有许多事情需要去干，这就要学习地质工作者的崇高品德——吃苦在前，享受在后；艰苦奋斗，无私奉献。
