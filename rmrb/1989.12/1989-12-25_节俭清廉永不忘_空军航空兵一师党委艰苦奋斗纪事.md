Those who have visited the First Division of the Air Force Aviation Corps have all been moved by their unwavering commitment to hard work and thrift. Despite poor environmental conditions, they remain steadfast in their efforts to improve; even as living conditions improve, they continue to be frugal and save where they can.

When the unit faces difficulties, the party committee of the First Division prioritizes solving the problems of the grassroots soldiers and officers, rather than keeping the benefits for themselves. Since the 1970s, several generations of division leaders have lived in the same old, dilapidated buildings as the ground troops. A few years ago, with the support of higher authorities, the division headquarters built two new residential buildings. Some people speculated that the division leaders would finally move out of the old buildings and into the new ones. However, after the new buildings were completed, all the housing was allocated to the pilots, and the division leaders continued to live in the old buildings. It was only recently that they moved into new residences with the support of higher authorities. Thus, some ground troops, when they complain about their crowded living conditions, think of the division leaders' actions and have nothing more to say.

The daily food allowance for the division commander and other flight leaders is over 10 yuan. When they are not flying, if they take their food allowance from the flight kitchen and eat at home, they could increase their income significantly. But they do not do this; instead, they insist on eating at the flight kitchen, just like the other pilots. They often go to a flight brigade far from the headquarters to oversee flight training. There, they eat at the flight kitchen, paying over 10 yuan per day. If they ate at the unit's dining hall, it would only cost them a little over 1 yuan per day (with subsidies), but they choose to eat at the flight kitchen. They speak frankly: "We are all Communist Party members. How can Communist Party members always look for the easiest way out?"

In recent years, the state has faced financial difficulties, and military funds are tight. The division party committee has taken the initiative to share the nation's burdens, choosing the path of self-development and self-improvement. They have successively established a paper box factory, a galvanized pipe factory, a flatbed factory, a metal structure factory, and an automobile repair shop, with increasing profits. They use part of the revenue to improve the material and cultural lives of the grassroots units. The members of the division party committee also lead the soldiers in developing agricultural and sideline production, digging fish ponds, planting trees, raising chickens, fish, pigs, cows, and vegetables. Life has improved significantly. With the help of higher authorities, they have built 8 new dormitory buildings, renovated and maintained the old family buildings, and constructed a pilot command tower, a ground-air support combat duty room, a pilot rest room, an aircraft maintenance logistics command center, and a sports training center. The camp's greening has been recognized as an "advanced garden-style camp" by the city.

One brigade is stationed year-round in a mountainous valley where "there is no grass on the mountains, and the wind blows the stones away," making the conditions extremely harsh. The division party committee leads the soldiers of this brigade in a long-term struggle to improve the environment. To green the camp, when there is no water to water the saplings, the soldiers carry water in basins from the mountain to the camp. During the construction of the training ground, the division leaders and the brigade leaders used steel chisels to carve out a topographical map on the concrete floor, breaking their knuckles and forming blisters. They wore out 6 steel chisels. Their sweat and hard work have yielded bountiful results. Now, there are green trees, a picturesque camp, and spacious basketball, football, and ice-skating courts. The aeronautical theory classroom, cultural entertainment room, and library stand proudly.

After years of hard work, the First Division has some money, but the division party committee has never relaxed its frugal mindset. For a while, buying imported luxury cars became a trend. The First Division had the money to buy a luxury car, and some people suggested that the division leaders follow the trend and buy one. However, the division party committee believes: "Money should not be used to buy luxury cars because this money is hard-earned, and every penny should be spent wisely." The division did not buy one, but a subordinate production and operation unit secretly bought a used "Blue Bird" car and sent it to the division leaders. After discussion, the division party committee unanimously decided: "Riding in such a car does not necessarily improve work efficiency. We just need a car to sit in and not delay work." The division leaders did not use the car.

The guiding principle for the First Division's expenditure is to avoid formalism, not to show off, to save where possible, and to emphasize practical results. On November 20 of last year, the First Division celebrated its 8th anniversary of safe flying. This is a day worth celebrating. Many comrades suggested spending over 100,000 yuan to buy commemorative items, hold a collective banquet, and celebrate heartily. The division party committee decided that this would be too expensive and proposed traditional education and position-based skills competitions instead. The result was that the grassroots soldiers were very satisfied: without spending much money, the celebration was still very successful.

The division is responsible for combat readiness and training, requiring a large amount of aviation fuel. They have formulated a set of effective fuel-saving measures, even collecting the oil that drips from certain parts of the aircraft. This accumulation of small amounts has saved thousands of tons of fuel each year. Last year, the entire army held a field meeting at the First Division to promote their fuel-saving experiences.

Some people summarize the work style of the First Division leaders as: "One more, two competitions, three difficulties." "One more" means spending more time at the grassroots level. In recent years, each person has spent an average of over 140 days at the grassroots level, with the most spending 207 days. "Two competitions" means competing to do more work. Since 1984, during the six Spring Festivals, the party committee members have all competed to be on duty at the unit, with the political commissar spending four Spring Festivals at the unit. "Three difficulties" means it is difficult to decide who should take leave or go for a rest. The party committee members do not want to leave their work positions for a rest. Sometimes, Commander Geng flies during the day and trains at night, working more than 12 hours a day. But if he is forced to go for a two-week rest, it is not effective.

They reap what they sow. Their hard work has yielded a bumper harvest. The work of the entire division is on a steady upward trend, with 95% of the grassroots units being good or relatively good.

    节俭清廉永不忘
    ——空军航空兵一师党委艰苦奋斗纪事
    刘从札　荣庆祥　李志臣
    凡是到过空军航空兵一师的，无不被他们那种自觉坚持艰苦奋斗的事迹所感动：环境条件差，他们矢志不渝，乐在奋斗中求改善；生活条件变好了，他们仍然惜物如今，能省则省……
    当部队生活遇到困难的时候，空一师党委首先为基层官兵排忧解难，而不是把好处留给自己。自70年代起，几任师领导干部都同一般地面干部一样挤住在30年代盖的破旧小楼里。前两年在上级关怀下，师机关大院先后盖起两栋家属楼，有人议论，这下师领导该离旧房进新楼了。可新楼盖起后，全部分给飞行员，师领导仍然住在原来的旧房里。直到最近，他们在上级领导关怀下，才搬进新居。这样，有些地面干部每当因自己住房太挤想发牢骚时，一想起师领导不计较住房条件的行动，就没话说了。
    师长和其他飞行领导干部的伙食费每天10多元。不飞行时，如果他们将伙食费从空勤灶领出回家吃，每月可增加不少收入。但他们不这样做，同其他飞行员们一样，坚持到空勤灶就餐。他们经常到远离机关的一个飞行团抓飞行训练，在那里，他们到空勤灶就餐，每天要交空勤灶伙食费10多元。如果在部队招待灶就餐，每天只需交1元多钱（有补贴），而他们选择了空勤灶。他们说得很实在：“我们都是共产党员，共产党员怎能哪有便宜就往哪里钻呢？”
    这几年，国家财政有困难，军费紧张。师党委自觉为国分忧，走自我发展、自我完善的道路。他们陆续兴办纸盒厂、镀锌管厂、平板厂、金属结构厂、汽车修理厂等，效益不断增加。他们从收益中拿出一部分钱，改善基层的物质文化生活。师党委成员还带领官兵大搞农副业生产，挖鱼塘、栽树、养鸡、养鱼、养猪、养牛、种菜，生活有了很大改善。他们在上级的帮助下，新盖起8栋宿舍楼，对老家属楼普遍进行了粉刷和维修。还新建了飞行员指挥塔台、空地勤战斗值班室、飞行员休息室、机务后勤指挥中心、体育训练中心等。营院绿化被所在市评为“花园式先进大院”。
    有一个团常年驻守在“山上没有草，风吹石头跑”的大山沟里，条件非常艰苦。师党委带领这个团的官兵为改变环境常年苦干。绿化营区，浇树苗没有水，官兵们每次到山下吃饭时，人人带着脸盆，回来时端一盆水，给树苗浇上。在修建演练场时，师领导和这个团的领导用钢凿一点一点地在水泥地板上凿出一地形地物图案，震裂了虎口，磨出了血泡，凿秃了6根钢凿。汗水和辛劳换来了丰硕的成果。如今这里绿树成荫，营院如画，篮球场、足球场、溜冰场平坦宽阔，航理教室、文化娱乐室、图书阅览室昂然耸立。
    空一师经过艰苦奋斗，手里有点钱了，但空一师党委思想上过紧日子的这根弦一刻也没有松。有一阵子，买进口高档车成风。空一师购买高档车的钱是有的，也有人建议师领导顺着风势买一辆。但师党委认为：“有钱不能用来买豪华轿车，因为这钱来之不易，一分一厘都要花在刀刃上。”师里没有买，所属生产经营单位悄悄买了一辆半新的“蓝鸟”牌小轿车，送给师领导用。师党委研究后，一致认为：坐这样的车，不见得能提高多少工作效率。我们只要有车坐、不耽误工作就行。这辆车，师领导到底没有坐。
    不图形式，不摆阔气，能省则省，讲求实效，这是空一师经费开支的指导思想。去年11月20日，空一师安全飞行8周年。这是值得庆贺的日子。不少同志提议花10多万元，购买纪念品，搞集体大会餐，痛痛快快庆贺一番。师党委研究认为，这样搞花钱太多，可改成传统教育和岗位练兵竞赛。结果，基层官兵反映很好：没花几个钱，庆祝活动照样搞得挺好。
    这个师担负战备训练任务，需要大批量的航空油料。他们制订了一整套行之有效的节油措施，就连飞机某些部位渗油也不放过，用只小盒点点滴滴接起来。这样积少成多，每年节油几千吨。去年全军在空一师召开现场会，推广他们的节油经验。
    有人把空一师领导的工作姿态概括为：一多二争三难。“一多”就是下基层时间多。近几年来，每人每年下基层平均在140天以上，最多的207天。“二争”就是争工作做。从1984年以来的6个春节，党委成员都是争着到部队担负战斗值班，其中师政委有4个春节是在部队度过的。“三难”是让谁休假、疗养难。党委成员都不愿离开工作岗位去图轻闲。有的时候，耿师长白天驾机飞行，晚上跟班训练，一天工作12个小时以上。可要让他去疗养两周，强迫他也不成。
    一分耕耘一分收获。他们付出巨大的劳动，得到是大面积丰收。全师工作呈稳步上升趋势，好的和比较好的基层单位占95％。
