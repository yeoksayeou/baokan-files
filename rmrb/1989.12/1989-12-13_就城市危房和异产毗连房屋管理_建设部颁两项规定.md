Recently, Minister of Construction Lin Hanxiong signed and issued the "Regulations on the Management of Urban Dangerous Houses" and the "Regulations on the Management of Urban Adjacent Houses with Different Ownerships." Both regulations will come into effect on January 1, 1990.

Currently, there are over 30 million square meters of dangerous houses in China's cities, and every year, another million square meters of houses become dangerous. Whenever storms and rains come, house collapses occur frequently, causing significant damage to people's lives and property.

Urban adjacent houses with different ownerships refer to houses that are structurally connected or share common facilities and auxiliary buildings, but are owned by different individuals. There are many such houses in cities, and their number is increasing, leading to a growing number of civil disputes.

The two regulations issued this time clarify the management authority for the above two types of houses: the Ministry of Construction is responsible for the management of urban dangerous houses and adjacent houses with different ownerships nationwide, while the real estate administrative departments of county-level and above local people's governments are responsible for the management of urban dangerous houses and adjacent houses with different ownerships within their jurisdictions.

    就城市危房和异产毗连房屋管理
    建设部颁两项规定
    本报讯　最近，建设部部长林汉雄签署颁布了《城市危险房屋管理规定》和《城市异产毗连房屋管理规定》。这两个规定均从1990年1月1日起施行。
    目前我国城市中的危险房屋有3000多万平方米，而且每年还有上千万平方米的房屋变成危险房屋。每当风雨袭来，房屋倒塌事故屡有发生，给人民生命财产造成极大的损失和威胁。
    城市异产毗连房屋是指结构相连或具有共有、共用设备和附属建筑，而为不同所有人所共有的房屋。此类房屋在城市中为数不少，且日益增多，由此而产生的民事纠纷案件也在与日俱增。
    此次颁布的两项规定明确了以上两种房屋的管理权限，即：建设部负责全国的城市危险房屋和异产毗连房屋的管理工作，县级以上地方人民政府房地产行政主管部门负责本辖区的城市危险房屋和异产毗连房屋的管理工作。
