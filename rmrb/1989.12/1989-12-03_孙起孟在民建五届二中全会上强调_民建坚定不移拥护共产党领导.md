    Sun Qimeng Emphasizes Unswervingly Supporting the CCP's Leadership at the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association

    BEIJING, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association Sun Qimeng said today that no matter how complicated the situation is, the CDNCA will unshakably adhere to the following principles: firmly support the leadership of the Communist Party, adhere to the socialist path, and draw a clear line with any attempts to create an opposition party and promote capitalist ideas and activities, and engage in struggle.
