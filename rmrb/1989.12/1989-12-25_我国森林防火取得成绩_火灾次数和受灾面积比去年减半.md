How has China's forest fire prevention work progressed since the major forest fire in the Great Khingan Range? Reporters learned from the recent National Forestry Bureau Directors' Meeting that China's forest fire prevention work has made remarkable achievements in the past two years, with a significant reduction in the number of fire incidents and the affected forest areas. In 1989, forest fire prevention work reached a historic best level.

According to preliminary statistics, the number of forest fires and the affected forest areas in China in 1989 decreased by 55% and 50% respectively compared to the previous year. The damage rate dropped from the average of 8‰ since the founding of the People's Republic to 0.4‰, lower than the 0.6‰ in 1988 and also lower than the world average of 1‰. Provinces and municipalities such as Jilin and Heilongjiang, among 22 in total, have shown a good trend of significant and balanced reduction in forest fires.

China's forest fire prevention has achieved such good results mainly because various levels of government departments have generally established and improved management systems for people entering the mountains and approval for outdoor fires, in accordance with the provisions of the "Forest Fire Prevention Regulations." During the fire prevention period, strict orders are issued to prohibit all outdoor fires, ensuring that smoke is investigated immediately and fires are punished promptly. Once a fire causes damage, those responsible are held accountable. Some key provinces and regions have also implemented fire risk weather forecasts and established a multi-level fire prevention responsibility system, ensuring accountability down to the individual. The enhanced public awareness of fire prevention has significantly reduced the risk of forest fires.

The strengthening of professional firefighting teams and increased investment in fire prevention infrastructure have greatly improved China's comprehensive forest fire prevention and firefighting capabilities. Various regions have raised over 100 million yuan to strengthen the construction of fire lookout towers, fire communication, transportation, and firefighting equipment, significantly reducing major forest fires in China.

    我国森林防火取得成绩
    火灾次数和受灾面积比去年减半
    新华社北京12月24日电（记者杜笑岩、张建军）大兴安岭特大森林火灾后我国森林防火工作进展如何？记者从日前召开的全国林业厅局长会议上获悉，我国近两年森林防火工作成绩斐然，火灾次数和受灾面积大幅度下降，1989年森林防火工作又创历史最好水平。
    据初步统计，1989年我国森林火灾次数和受害森林面积分别比上年减少55％和50％，受害率由建国以来的平均8‰下降到0.4‰，低于1988年的0.6‰，更低于世界平均1‰的水平。吉林、黑龙江等22省、区、市出现了森林火灾大面积均衡下降的好势头。
    我国森林防火取得这样好的成绩，主要是各级政府部门普遍按照《森林防火条例》的规定，建立健全了入山人员管理、野外用火审批等火源管理制度，进入防火戒严期发布戒严令，严禁一切野外用火，做到见烟就查，见火就罚，成灾就抓。一些重点省区还开展了火险天气预报，并层层建立防火责任制，落实到人。全民防火意识的增强，使森林火灾隐情大大降低。
    扑火专业队伍建设的加强和增加对防火基础设施的投入，极大地提高了我国森林防火和灭火的综合能力。各地还筹集一亿多元资金普遍加强了防火瞭望塔、防火通讯、运输、扑火机具的建设，使我国大的森林火灾大幅度减少。
