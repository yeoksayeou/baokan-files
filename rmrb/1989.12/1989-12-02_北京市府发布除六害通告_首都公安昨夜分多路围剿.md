BEIJING, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Government today issued a notice to eliminate prostitution, gambling, drug trafficking, and other "six evils," urging lawbreakers to surrender immediately or face severe legal consequences.

The notice states that individuals involved in the "six evils" must immediately cease their illegal activities, confess to the public security organs within one month, and guarantee that they will not repeat their offenses. The public security organs will handle those who surrender or provide information leading to the arrest of others leniently or may not pursue charges; those who refuse to surrender will be severely punished.

Today, the public security organs in Haidian, Dongcheng, and other districts took immediate action according to the notice, launching a crackdown on the "six evils." The Dongcheng Public Security Bureau dispatched 650 police officers and over 300 auxiliary personnel in 10 teams to raid crime dens. Dongcheng Public Security Bureau Chief Jia Binwu said that since October, the district has apprehended 647 individuals involved in the "six evils." By today, the Dongcheng Public Security Bureau has received 197 tips from the public about prostitution and gambling, with 10 individuals surrendering.

The Haidian Public Security Bureau today publicly handled, according to law, 13 criminals, including Nie Jing and Cui Xiurong, who were involved in organized gambling and harboring women for prostitution. Among them, 6 were arrested, and 7 were sent to labor re-education.
