    Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Comments on U.S. President's Veto of Bill to Relax Immigration Laws for Chinese
    Noted that the U.S. President vetoed the bill to relax immigration laws for Chinese
    Regrettably, administrative measures have been used to implement the bill's provisions

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7th: Reporter Gu Yuqing reports: Today, at a press conference, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson pointed out that the U.S. approach to the so-called "1989 Emergency Bill to Relax Immigration Laws for Chinese" will inevitably cause serious damage to educational exchanges between China and the U.S., and the responsibility lies with the U.S. side.

    The spokesperson said, we have noted that the U.S. President has vetoed the "1989 Emergency Bill to Relax Immigration Laws for Chinese" passed by the Congress. Regrettably, administrative measures have been used to implement the bill's provisions. The dispatch, management, and repatriation of Chinese students are China's internal affairs, and foreign governments and parliaments have no right to interfere. Requiring government-sponsored students to return to serve their country after completing their studies is a natural and reasonable requirement, and it is also in line with international practices and the understandings reached between China and the U.S. The claim that Chinese students returning to China may face persecution is completely groundless. We urge the U.S. government to immediately stop all actions that disrupt educational exchanges and relations between the two countries.

    外交部发言人发表评论
    注意到美国总统否决了放宽中国移民法案
    遗憾的是又以行政手段实施法案各项措施
    本报北京十二月七日讯　记者顾玉清报道：中国外交部发言人今天下午在新闻发布会上回答记者提问时指出，美国在所谓“一九八九年紧急放宽中国移民法案”方面的作法，势必给中美教育交流带来严重损害，责任在美国方面。
    发言人说，我们注意到美国总统搁置否决了国会“一九八九年紧急放宽中国移民法案”，遗憾的是又以行政手段使法案的各项措施得以实施。中国留学人员的派遣、管理和回国安置是中国的内部事务，外国政府和议会都无权干涉。要求公费留学人员学成回国服务是理所当然的，也符合国际惯例和中美双方达成的谅解。所谓中国留学人员回国可能受到迫害的说法是毫无根据的。我们敦促美国政府立即停止一切破坏两国教育交流和两国关系的行动。
