Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper reprints an article from the Beijing Daily about 150 new students at Peking University applying to join the Party, and an article from the Shanghai Wenhui Daily featuring a letter from seven new Party members at Fudan University to Comrade Li Yun. It can be seen that after several months of reflection and education, positive changes are taking place among college students. Our Party has always believed that youth are the hope and future of the country. The Party has always been full of confidence in the youth, believing that as long as they understand the origins and developments of the situation, see through the plots and ambitions of those advocating bourgeois liberalization, they will be able to distinguish right from wrong, follow the truth, and stand with the Party and the people. As Comrade Xiaoping recently said: "Recently, I have seen that the situation among students is gratifying. They are truly reflecting, and this is a great education. There are many problems, but the ability to reflect is the most important education, more important than reading any book."

We warmly welcome more students to make new progress through reflection.

Beijing Daily, December 25, on 150 new students at Peking University applying to join the Party

Our reporter: Among the 89-level new students at Peking University, more than 150 have submitted applications to join the Party, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of new students.

More than 700 new students from Peking University have been in Shijiazhuang Army Academy for military and political training for over two months. After systematic political theory learning and political thought education, many students have deepened their understanding of communism and voluntarily applied to join the Party organization. New student Chen Yutian said: "I think the exemplary leading role of the broad Party members, and the collective strength under the leadership of the Party, is something that individual strength cannot compare with." Wang Shaofeng wrote in his application: "A revolutionary youth with ideals and aspirations can only join the Party organization to better serve the people and thus realize the true value of life. No matter how much changes occur in the future, following the Party will be my lifelong pursuit."

Shanghai Wenhui Daily, December 24, publishes a letter from seven new Party members at Fudan University to Comrade Li Yun

Respected Comrade Li Yun:

First of all, we wish to express our heartfelt thanks and high respect to you, to all the loyal old-generation communists who care about our growth, in the name of a group of young communists!

Your warm call of "comrade" made us feel especially warm and excited. We once again strongly realized that we are in the great current of struggling for the cause of communism, starting a new journey of life.

Your sincere words made us deeply realize the sacred and arduous historical mission we bear. You, this generation of communists, have dedicated all your blood and sweat to the cause of the Party and pushed the wheel of history forward to a new stage. You eagerly hope that the younger generation will quickly catch up and take up the banner of communism. However, the spread of bourgeois liberalization has poisoned many young people, tarnished the image of the Party, and ridiculed communism, making you sleepless and worried. Now, the gloom has been dispelled, and a new force has joined the ranks of the Party. We can fully understand your joy and excitement at this moment. As young communist warriors, it is our solemn duty to carry on the torch and open up new paths; the new generation of communists will definitely not disappoint your expectations. We firmly believe that the cause of communism will not be abandoned in our hands but will be passed on and achieve new great progress.

To fulfill our oath, it is undoubtedly not an easy task. We have gone through long-term efforts and the recent turmoil to join the Party, but we feel that we are still far from the standard of a mature communist. In the future, there will still be many storms, and can we stand the test? We ask ourselves this serious question. Our answer is: only by constantly strengthening our Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation, constantly firming our communist life belief, and constantly going to social practice to learn and temper ourselves, can we gradually mature. We will constantly draw strength and enlightenment from the shadows and footsteps of our predecessors. You are our comrade and also our mentor; we welcome your guidance, help, and support in our growth process.

We are also happy to tell you: among the youth, among college students, those who seek progress are not just a few of us, but a large group. After the turmoil and unrest, college students have become much more sober and mature, and the effect of reflection is very positive. Now, colleges are beginning to see a trend of studying Marx and Lenin's original works, and the ideal of communism is conquering more and more young hearts with the power of scientific truth. We, the first batch of college students to join the Party after the turmoil, are just representatives of such a progressive force. The cause of communism has successors and is full of hope. Dear comrade, respected teacher, your confidence in the victory of the cause of communism is fully justified! Let us strive together for it!

With high respect from communists!

    大学生中的可喜变化
    编者按　今天本报转载北京日报关于北大150名新生要求入党的新闻和上海文汇报发表的复旦大学7名新入党同学给李云同志的复信。
    可以看出，经过几个月的反思和教育，大学生中正在发生可喜的变化。我们党历来认为，青年是国家的希望和未来，党对青年始终是充满信心的，相信他们只要弄清了事情的来龙去脉，识破了那些搞资产阶级自由化人的阴谋和野心，他们就会明辨是非，服从真理，就会和党和人民站到一起来。正像小平同志不久前所说的：“最近我看到学生的现象是可喜的。他们真正在反思，是个大教育啊。问题是很多，但能进行反思就是一个最大的教育，比读什么书都重要。”
    我们热切欢迎有更多的同学在反思中取得新的进步。
    北京日报12月25日关于北大150名新生申请入党的报道
    本报讯　北京大学89级新生中目前已有150多人递交了入党申请书，占新生总数1／5。
    北大700多名新生到石家庄陆军学院参加军政训练已两个多月。经过系统的政治理论学习和政治思想教育，许多学生加深了对共产主义的认识，自愿向党组织提出了入党申请。新生陈玉田说：“我认为，广大党员的模范带头作用，在党的领导下汇集成整体的合力，这是个人的力量无法比拟的。”王少峰在申请书中写道：“一个有理想有抱负的革命青年，只有加入党的组织，才能更切实地、更好地为人民服务，从而实现人生的真正价值。无论今后发生多大的变化，紧紧跟党走，将是我毕生的追求。”
    上海文汇报12月24日发表复旦大学7名新入党同学给李云同志的复信尊敬的李云同志：
    首先，我们愿以一群年轻共产党员的名义，向您，向所有关注我们成长的，忠贞的老一辈共产党人，表达由衷的感谢和崇高的敬意！
    您的一声“同志”的亲切呼唤，使我们感到分外的温暖和激动。我们再次强烈地意识到自己已置身于为共产主义事业而奋斗的洪流之中，开始了崭新的人生旅程。
    您热切的话语，使我们深深意识到自己所肩负的神圣而艰巨的历史使命。你们这一代共产党人，把自己的全部心血都献给了党的事业，并推动历史的车轮前进到一段新的里程。你们殷切地期望年轻一代尽快跟上来，接过共产主义的旗帜。然而，资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，使不少年轻人受到毒害，党的形象受到污损，共产主义受到嘲弄，你们为此寝食不安、忧心忡忡。现在，阴霾已被扫除，党的队伍中又汇入了一批新生力量，我们完全能够体会到您此时此刻欣喜、振奋的心情。作为年轻的共产主义战士，承前启后、继往开来，是我们的庄严责任；新一代共产党人，一定不会辜负您的期望。我们坚信：共产主义事业不仅不会在我们这一代手中被断送，而必将薪火相传，继续取得新的伟大进步。
    要实现自己的誓言，无疑不是一件轻松的事情。我们经过长期的努力和前不久动乱的考验而光荣入党，但深感自己离成熟的共产党员的标准仍有距离。今后，大风大浪的日子还经常会有，我们又能否经得起考验？我们向自己提出这个严峻的问题。我们的答案是：只有不断地增强自身的马列主义理论修养，不断地坚定自己的共产主义人生信念，不断地自觉到社会实践中去学习、去磨练，我们就一定能使自己逐渐成熟起来。我们将不断地从前驱者的身影和足迹中汲取力量、获得启迪。您是我们的同志，也是我们的师长；我们在成长过程中，将永远欢迎你们老一代共产党人的“传、帮、带”。
    我们还要高兴地告诉您：在青年中，在大学生中，要求进步的绝不仅仅是我们这几个人，而是一大批。经过学潮和动乱，大学生们清醒、成熟了许多，反思的效果是非常积极的。现在，大学里开始出现了学习马列原著热潮，共产主义理想正以其科学真理的力量征服着越来越多年轻人的心。我们这些在动乱后首批入党的大学生，只是这样一支进步力量的代表。共产主义的事业后继有人，大有希望。亲爱的同志，敬爱的老师，您对共产主义事业的必胜信心是有充分理由的！让我们一起为之奋斗吧！
        致以共产党员的崇高敬礼！
