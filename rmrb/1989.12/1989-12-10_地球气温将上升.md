    Global temperatures are expected to rise by 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2020, which will have extremely serious consequences for ecological balance, warned Godwin Obasi, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, recently in Santiago.

    Obasi was in the Chilean capital to attend the Latin American and Caribbean Technical Conference on the Economic Benefits of Meteorology and Hydrology.

    He pointed out that as global temperatures rise, sea levels may also increase by 20 centimeters to 140 centimeters.

    Obasi said that based on reports from 170 meteorological stations around the world on surface pollution, the chemical composition of the atmosphere has already changed. Since 1880, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 25%, which is the main cause of the greenhouse effect.

    He also noted that the ozone layer over the Antarctic is thinning more than it did last year. Ozone has the function of reducing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun that is detrimental to human health. He urged all countries to take emergency measures to stop the further rise in temperatures.

    地球气温将上升
    新华社圣地亚哥电　世界气象组织秘书长戈德温·奥巴西最近在这里警告说，地球气温在2020年估计将上升4摄氏度，这将在生态平衡方面给人类带来极严重的后果。
    戈德温是来智利首都圣地亚哥出席拉美和加勒比气象及水文经济效益技术大会的。
    他指出，随着地球气温升高，海平面也可能将上升20厘米至140厘米。
    戈德温说，根据世界各地170个气象站关于地面污染的报告，目前大气中的化学成分已有变化。从1880年起，大气中的二氧化碳已增加了25％，这是造成温室效应的主要原因。
    他还指出，目前，南极上空的臭氧层比去年更加减少，而臭氧具有减少对人体有害的太阳光中过度的紫外线辐射的功能。他要求各国采取紧急措施，以制止气温进一步升高。
