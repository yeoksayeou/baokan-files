When I was young, I was deeply fond of traditional Chinese painting and once studied under the renowned bird-and-flower painter, Master Wang Xue Tao. Although Master Wang's works were widely circulated after being printed, admirers could only learn and study his exquisite techniques through analyzing and copying his works. In the past, there were no videos, let alone the systematic electronic teaching methods we have today. Even the great artist Xu Beihong did not leave behind even a single moving image for us. Ten years ago, I was transferred to the Central Electronic Education Institute. One day, I brought a film crew to the home of Master Wang, who was then the director of the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts. We filmed the entire process of creating a three-foot-long masterpiece featuring a magpie and red leaves. Two cameras captured the entire process, and I knew this would bring great joy to Master Wang's admirers. I also knew that this footage would be more valuable than the original artwork.

Now, we can use modern methods such as film, video, audio recording, and slide shows to store information and record precious materials, thereby preserving and promoting our national cultural and artistic traditions. This is itself very meaningful. A few years ago, the Central Electronic Education Institute filmed a documentary for UNESCO titled "Training of Chinese Opera Performers," which aimed to introduce how member countries protect cultural heritage. The film was very well-received. The ending scene featured the renowned Peking Opera performer Li Wan Chun performing the role of the Monkey King stealing the immortal peaches in "The Monkey King Uproars Heaven." Not long after, Li Wan Chun passed away, and that scene left behind a precious visual record, which is truly moving. Such audiovisual materials break through the limitations of time and space and can be watched repeatedly, equivalent to having an excellent teacher who never gets tired, truly benefiting the learners. As for classroom teaching videos like the one featuring Nanjing's outstanding teacher Si Xia's language class "We Love Our Motherland," they have significantly promoted teaching reforms and teacher training.

Electronic education is not limited to school classrooms but is closely related to the entire society. Recently, the painter Gao Songlu assisted the Electronic Education Institute in filming a series of videos titled "Chinese Painting Techniques," selecting 20 topics from bird-and-flower and landscape paintings. For those who love painting, the best shooting angles were chosen, and the painter demonstrated basic painting techniques while explaining. The videos were immediately welcomed by enthusiasts of Chinese painting, art teachers, and retired cadres, serving as a social arts education material. Moreover, just as the previously filmed videos on Chinese history, Chinese geography, Chinese cuisine, and traditional Chinese medicine massage did, they aroused great interest among foreign friends. The facts have proven that electronic education not only has advanced methods but is also widely welcomed both domestically and internationally.

Currently, many schools, government agencies, factories, and enterprises in our country can produce video programs, and even more units and households have video players. If we can leverage social resources to film more cultural and educational videos, it will greatly contribute to improving national cultural quality and strengthening spiritual civilization construction. I hope everyone will pay attention to this new endeavor of electronic education.

### 电化教育正走向社会

    电化教育正走向社会
    周君达
    年轻时我酷爱国画，曾师从著名花鸟画家王雪涛先生。雪涛先生的作品经印刷后虽广为流传，但对于他的精湛技艺，仰慕者却只能借助对作品的分析、临摹来学习、研究。过去没有录像，更无今日已形成系统的电化教学，就连艺术大师徐悲鸿先生，也没来得及给我们留下哪怕是一两个活动镜头。十年前，我调入中央电化教育馆，一日，我带了一个摄制组来到任北京画院院长的雪涛先生家，为他拍摄录像片，一幅三尺大小以八哥红叶为主体的花鸟精品的整个创作过程，被两台摄像机纳入镜头，我知道这会给王先生的崇拜者带来多大的喜悦，也知道这片子成了比原作更有价值的资料。
    现在，我们可以应用电影、录像、录音、幻灯等现代化手段，储存信息，记录珍贵资料，以保存和弘扬民族文化艺术传统，这本身就是很有意思的。前几年，中央电化教育馆为联合国教科文组织拍摄了一部旨在介绍会员国如何保护文化遗产的影片《中国京剧演员的训练》，拿去后很受欢迎。该片结尾拍摄了京剧表演艺术家李万春先生在《闹天宫》里猴王偷吃仙桃的一场戏。事隔不久，李万春先生便作古，那段镜头给后人留下了珍贵的形象资料，实令人感慨万分。这样的影视资料突破了时空的局限，又能反复观看，等于请来了永不疲倦的优秀老师，真是造福于学习者。至于像南京特级教师斯霞的语文课《我们爱祖国》一类的课堂教学实况录像，更是有力地促进了教学改革和师资培训。
    电化教育不仅仅局限于学校课堂，更与整个社会息息相关。最近，书画家高松庐先生协助电教馆拍摄了一套《中国画技法》录像片，从花鸟、山水中精选了20个课题，为学画者计，采取最佳拍摄角度，由画家边讲边画进行国画基本技法的讲授。片子一出来，立即受到国画爱好者、美术教师和离退休干部的欢迎，也算是社会美育的教材。而且，一如过去所拍有关中国历史、中国地理、中国菜系、中医按摩等片一样，引起外国朋友的极大兴趣。事实证明，电化教育不仅手段先进，而且受到了国内外普遍欢迎。
    目前，我国的学校、机关、厂矿、企业等，能制作录像节目的单位不少，有放像机的单位乃至家庭就更多了。如果能借助社会的力量，拍摄更多的文化教育片，对于提高民族文化素质，加强精神文明建设，定会起更大作用，希望大家来关心电化教育这一新的事业。
