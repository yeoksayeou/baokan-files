Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 3rd.

Leaders of Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh congratulated V.P. Singh on his election as the Indian Prime Minister and praised his efforts to improve relations with neighboring countries.

The leaders of Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh sent congratulatory messages to Singh on December 2nd, expressing their appreciation for his commitment to improving relations with neighboring countries.

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Premadasa, in his congratulatory message to Singh, said that the Sri Lankan people particularly welcomed Singh's assurance to improve Indo-Sri Lankan relations.

Singh, who took the oath of office yesterday, told reporters that his first priority would be to lower India's prices and improve relations with neighboring countries, especially Sri Lanka and Nepal.

Just a few hours after taking office, Singh ordered the Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka to accelerate their withdrawal. The Indian troops had entered Sri Lanka in July 1987 to help suppress the Tamil insurgency.

Premadasa noted that relations between the two countries had been somewhat strained recently and were not satisfactory. He hoped that the two countries could eliminate the tension and restore their traditional friendly relations.

Nepalese Prime Minister Shreshta, in his congratulatory message, expressed the belief that the traditional close and friendly relations between the two countries would improve the interests of the peoples of both countries.

The relations between Nepal and India had been in a stalemate since the trade and transit agreements between the two countries expired on March 23rd. This had caused difficulties for the landlocked country of Nepal.

Bangladeshi President Ershad, in his congratulatory message, hoped that the friendly relations between Bangladesh and India would further develop in an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding.

    斯尼孟三国领导人祝贺辛格当选印度总理
    赞赏印将注重改善与邻国关系
    新华社北京12月3日电  综述本社驻科伦坡、加德满都和达卡记者报道，和印度毗邻的斯里兰卡、尼泊尔和孟加拉国领导人2日分别祝贺维·普·辛格当选为印度总理并对他要改善与邻国的关系表示赞赏。斯总理普雷马达萨在致辛格的贺电中说，斯人民特别欢迎辛格表示要改善印斯关系的保证。
    昨天宣誓就任总理的辛格对记者说，他上任后优先处理的事情将是降低印度物价和改善印同邻国尤其是斯里兰卡和尼泊尔的关系。
    辛格就职数小时后就命令驻扎在斯里兰卡的印度军队加速撤出斯里兰卡。印度军队是于1987年7月为帮助斯平息泰米尔武装组织叛乱进驻斯里兰卡的。
    普雷马达萨总理指出，近来斯印两国关系有些紧张，不如人意。他希望两国能消除紧张，恢复传统的友好关系。
    尼泊尔首相什雷斯塔在贺电中表示相信，两国传统的密切和友好关系将会使两国人民的利益得到改善。
    尼、印关系在两国的贸易和过境条约于3月23日过期后陷入了僵局。它给内陆国尼泊尔造成了困难。
    孟加拉国总统艾尔沙德在贺电中希望今后孟、印的友好关系在合作和谅解的气氛中得到进一步的发展。
