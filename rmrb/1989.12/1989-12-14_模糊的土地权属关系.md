Land ownership in China is primarily divided into two forms: state-owned and collectively-owned land in rural areas. The characteristics of this system are that state-owned land is used by the state, and collectively-owned land is used by the collective; the rights of ownership and use are combined, and land is basically used without compensation. This non-value management method directly confuses the relationship between land owners and users, making the land users the de facto owners. As long as a department or unit uses the land, that portion of the land becomes the property of the department or unit. If the state or collective wants to use or adjust this land, they must pay compensation to these units. Land follows real estate, rather than real estate following land, fundamentally reversing the ownership relationship. Due to the chaotic and unclear land ownership relations, the units and departments using the land act independently, wasting and misusing the land at will.

After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, except for a small portion of land managed collectively, most of the land is contracted to individual households for use, separating ownership from use rights. In recent years, some places have seen frequent infringement by farmers, including plundering and consuming land productivity, leading to land degradation and damage; and arbitrarily occupying and misusing land, resulting in a significant reduction in land area.

It is clear that to cherish and protect the land, to stop the arbitrary occupation and misuse of land, it is necessary to further clarify the ownership relations of the land, establish a land management responsibility system, and fundamentally solve the problem.

In the aftermath of the Beijing turmoil during the spring and summer, some foreign investors were hesitant to return to the mainland, but the general manager of Hong Kong's Jia'an Leather Limited, Zhang Jintang, hurriedly went north to Laiyang Leather Factory. Why was Zhang Jintang so interested in Laiyang Leather Factory? The story did not begin this year.

Five years ago, the director of Laiyang Leather Factory, Zhao Deqing, went to Hong Kong to survey the fur market and met this general manager. After several visits, Zhang Jintang was convinced of Zhao Deqing's management capabilities. This time, Zhang came to Laiyang Leather Factory to discuss "compensatory trade" with Zhao, aiming to establish a joint venture, "Laiyang Honglong Leather Limited Company."

In recent years, Laiyang Leather Factory has already established a joint venture with Japanese clients, "Risen Leather Limited Company," and with Macanese clients, "Laiyang Changyi Mink Breeding Limited Company." Zhao Deqing wants to turn Laiyang Leather Factory into a comprehensive, export-oriented fur leather enterprise.

In December 1982, Zhao Deqing led nine colleagues to the Macao Jingyi Leather Limited Company to learn mink leather tanning technology. In Macao, he worked during the day and organized the data and technology he learned at night. As the saying goes, "The master leads you to the door, but the practice is up to you." In 180 days and nights in Macao, Zhao Deqing studied diligently and mastered all 70-plus processes of mink leather processing. When he was about to leave Macao, the general manager of Jingyi Company, Yang Tianyi, specially took out 40 mink skins for Zhao Deqing to process, wanting to see how well Zhao Deqing had "practiced." When Zhao Deqing delivered the 40 mink skins, soft and glossy, the general manager's eyes widened, from doubt to surprise, patting Zhao Deqing's shoulder and saying, "Out of 11 batches of people from the mainland learning fur processing technology, only you have grasped the essence. Go back and do it boldly, your career will definitely succeed!"

In July 1983, Laiyang Leather Factory produced its first batch of finished mink skins. After being inspected by relevant departments, the quality of the mink skins was fully qualified, and all chemical and physical indicators met export standards. Subsequently, Laiyang Leather Factory invested 20 million yuan to introduce a production line from the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy, capable of producing 1 million finished mink skins annually, further improving the production and quality of mink skins. The factory's mink skins were rated as quality-assured products by the Shandong Provincial Foreign Trade Commission and Provincial Commodity Inspection Bureau in 1985, exempting them from inspection for export.

While setting up the mink skin production line, Zhao Deqing recognized that the market for goat leather and goat leather garments would be promising, investing another 9 million yuan to establish a production line capable of producing 1 million leather goods annually. This became another major foreign exchange earner for the leather factory. Originally, the factory was just a processing point for Laiyang Livestock Procurement Station. By the end of 1988, it had fixed assets of 28.6 million yuan and earned 11 million US dollars in foreign exchange in 1988. As the saying goes, "Heaven has unpredictable changes." This year, China's fur exports encountered difficulties. Facing the fluctuating international market, Zhao Deqing remained calm. He said, "The changes in the international market are absolute, while stability is relative; it all depends on how you navigate it." They spared no effort to explore the market, overcoming difficulties to achieve the goal of earning more foreign exchange.

    模糊的土地权属关系
    山西省汾阳县　吕建英
    我国土地所有制基本上是国家所有和农村集体所有两种形式。它的特点是，国有土地国家使用，集体土地集体使用；两权合一，土地基本上是无偿使用的。这种非价值形式的管理方法，直接混淆了土地所有者和使用者的关系，使土地使用者成了实际的所有者。只要一个部门或一个单位使用了土地，这部分土地便成了部门和单位的财产，国家和集体要使用、调整这些土地，就得向这些单位付报酬。地产随房产走，而不是房产随地产走，权属关系从根本上被颠倒了。由于土地权属关系混乱不清，使用土地的单位和部门，各自为政，随意浪费和滥用所使用土地。
    农村实行家庭联产承包制后，除小部分土地由集体统一经营外，大部分包产到户，由农户使用，形成了所有权和使用权的分离。近几年，一些地方农户的侵权行为不断发生，一是对土地生产力的掠夺性使用和消耗，造成土地失修、损坏；二是乱占滥用土地，造成土地面积的大量锐减。
    由此可见，珍惜和保护土地，制止乱占滥用土地，必须进一步明确土地的权属关系，建立土地管理责任制，从根本上解决问题。莱阳裘革闯天下孙芳明
    春夏之交的北京风波过后，一些外商对回大陆投资有些犹豫，而香港嘉安皮革有限公司总经理曾锦堂却匆匆北上山东莱阳裘革厂。曾锦堂为什么对裘革厂这么感兴趣呢？事情非自今年始。
    5年前，莱阳裘革厂厂长赵德庆到香港考察裘皮市场，认识了这位总经理。几度来往，曾锦堂相信了赵德庆的经营能力，这次来裘革厂，要和赵厂长商谈开展“补偿贸易”，合资成立“莱阳港龙皮革有限公司”。
    近年来，莱阳裘革厂已与日本客商合资建立了日升皮革有限公司，与澳门客商合资成立了莱阳昌艺水貂养殖有限公司。赵德庆要把莱阳裘革厂办成饲养、加工一条龙的外向型裘革企业。
    1982年12月份，赵德庆带领9名同志到澳门精艺皮革有限公司学习裘革鞣制工艺。在澳门，他白天跟班劳动，晚上整理白天学到的数据、工艺。俗话说，师傅领进门，修行在个人。在澳门180个日日夜夜，赵德庆勤学苦练，把裘革加工工艺的70多道工序全部掌握。在即将离开澳门的时候，精艺公司总经理杨天一专门拿出40张水貂皮叫赵德庆加工，他要看看赵德庆“修炼”的程度如何。当赵德庆把40张皮板柔软，毛绒光洁的水貂皮送来时，这位总经理睁大了眼睛，由疑虑到惊喜，拍着赵德庆的肩膀说：“内地来了11批学习制裘工艺的，唯有你悟出了真谛，你回去大胆地干吧，你的事业一定能成功！”
    1983年7月，莱阳裘革厂生产的第一批成品水貂皮问世了。经有关部门鉴定，水貂皮质量全部合格，各项理化指标均达到出口标准。接着，莱阳裘革厂又投资2000万元人民币，从联邦德国、意大利引进年生产100万张成品水貂皮生产线，使裘皮产量、质量进一步提高。这个厂生产的水貂皮在1985年被山东省进出口委、省商检局评为质量信得过的产品，免检出口。
    在上水貂皮生产线的同时，赵德庆认准山羊皮制革和山羊皮服装市场将要看好，又花了900万元人民币上了一条年生产100万张皮革的生产线，成为裘革厂创汇的另一大支柱。这个厂原来只是莱阳畜产收购站的一个加工点，到1988年底已拥有固定资产 2860多万元，1988年创汇1100万美元。俗话说，天有不测风云。今年中国的裘皮出口遇到了困难。面对着风云变幻的国际市场，赵德庆泰然自若。他说，国际市场行情的变化是绝对的，不变是相对的，就看你如何驾驭它。他们千方百计开拓市场，克服困难实现多创汇的目标。
