    The urban social development comprehensive demonstration pilot project, jointly conducted by 18 ministries and organizations under the State Council, has achieved remarkable results in Changzhou City and Huazhuang Township in Jiangsu Province. Recently, the State Science and Technology Commission held a working conference on this in Changzhou.

    The urban social development comprehensive pilot project began in 1986. Its goal is to use advanced science and technology to address issues related to population, ecology, environment, health, education, culture, transportation, and communications in a way that suits local conditions. This aims to continuously improve the quality of life and the quality of the population, promoting the coordinated development of social development undertakings and economic construction.

    Over the past three years, Changzhou City and Huazhuang Township have implemented 55 and 25 social development projects respectively, initially forming a situation of coordinated social and economic development. Conference attendees were pleased to see that the main social development undertakings in the pilot areas, such as education, medical care, population control, environmental governance, and urban construction, are at the forefront of the nation. Changzhou City's industrial output value has increased by 24% in the past two years. The city has also established a social welfare and three-tier medical and health network, basically forming a social security system where the elderly are cared for, children are educated, the disabled are supported, the sick are treated, difficulties are addressed, and the deceased are properly buried. Huazhuang Township has achieved universal nine-year compulsory education, with a 100% enrollment rate for preschool children. Through the implementation of maternal and child health contract system, the township has insisted on promoting eugenics and childbearing, with a family planning rate of 98.3%.

    城镇社会发展综合示范试点成效明显
    常州市和华庄镇三年来社会经济协调发展
    本报南京12月29日电　新华社记者徐机玲、本报记者龚永泉报道：由国务院18个部委、团体协同开展的城镇社会发展综合示范试点工作，已在江苏省的常州市、无锡县华庄镇取得显著成效。日前，国家科委就此在常州召开工作会议。
    开展城镇社会发展综合试点是1986年开始的，其目的是通过采用先进的科学技术，因地制宜地处理好人口、生态、环境、卫生、教育、文化、交通、通讯等社会问题，不断提高生活质量和人口素质，促进社会发展事业与经济建设协调发展。
    三年来，常州市和华庄镇分别实施了55项和25项社会发展项目，初步形成了一个社会经济协调发展的局面。与会代表欣喜地看到，试点地区的教育、医疗保健、人口控制、环境治理、城镇建设等主要社会发展事业，已在全国居领先水平。常州市近两年工业总产值增长24％。全市还建立了社会福利和三级医疗卫生网络，基本形成老有所养、幼有所教、残有所安、病有所治、难有所办、死有所葬的社会保障体系。华庄镇已普及九年制义务教育，幼儿入托率达100％，并通过推行母子系列保健合同制度，坚持优生优育，全镇计划生育率达98.3％。
