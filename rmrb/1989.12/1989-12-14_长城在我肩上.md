Title: The Great Wall on My Shoulders

	The Great Wall on my shoulders,
	The Great Wall built with flesh and blood is the soul of the nation,
	A rope woven from the spirit of the people,
	I, as the son of a rope-puller, straighten it on my shoulders.
	Like my ancestors who traversed thousands of years of history,
	Silent through wind and rain,
	Silent through scorching sun,
	Bearing the burden means facing hardship,
	Hardship, but never ashamed,
	Struggling to pull the motherland forward.
	Father is gone, I am here,
	I am gone, there will be sons and grandsons.
	Even if the entire nation crawls like a mountain range on this land,
	With yellow skin, we proudly form—steadfastness.

	I am a blacksmith, I am a blacksmith,
	I have not forgotten the human furnace that forged iron,
	Forging swords, plows,
	Forging a history of war and peace.
	When I strike the anvil with a clang for October,
	Singing the song of creation,
	The rising flames become the red-hot present.
	When white doves fly over my head from the azure sky,
	Many "hotspots" on Earth still linger with the shadow of war.
	I forge today's thriving business like a forest,
	The anvil is the foundation of the country's strength.
	To eliminate war, I forge sharp swords,
	To sow peace, I plow the virgin land.

    长城在我肩上（外一首）
    况明先以血肉筑成的长城啊是民族之魂搓成的一根纤绳我以纤夫的儿子的名义拉直在肩上如父辈穿越几千年的历史仍然默不作声风风雨雨不作声炎炎烈日不作声负重就意味着艰难艰难却从不自卑奋力拉着祖国前行父亲死了有我我死了会有儿子、孙子即使整个民族匍匐成群峰在东方这块大地上也用黄皮肤骄傲地组成——坚毅
    我是锻工我是一名锻工　没有忘记人类冶铁的炉火锻剑　铸犁锻打着一部战争与和平的历史当我用叮当的锤声为十月唱响创造之歌升腾的炉火成为被我锻打得赤红的今天雪白的鸽群从湛蓝的天空飞过我头顶的时候地球上的许多“热点”依然弥漫着战争的阴云我锻造今天森林般蓬勃的事业铁砧是祖国强盛的基础为消灭战争我锻造青锋长剑为播种和平我锻犁开垦处女地
