On December 8th, the construction site for water control and land improvement in Liuhe County, Jiangbei, was filled with the sounds of labor songs echoing through the sky.

At 9 AM, six generals from the Nanjing Military Region, along with over 500 cadres from the headquarters, arrived at the site by car.

"Comrades, let's go!" The generals rolled up their trousers and sleeves, working like ordinary soldiers. Among them, some were already in their sixties, but they worked with great enthusiasm.

A nearly 70-year-old political commissar of the military region, with one shovel, dug into the hard soil, causing the shovel handle to bounce up. He gritted his teeth and dug again, continuing for ten shovels without stopping. The secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee, Dai Shunzhi, who was working alongside him, advised him not to work too hard. He replied, "It's been many years since I last did this kind of work. The Military Commission has stipulated that starting from 1990, every soldier must participate in at least 10 days of national economic construction labor each year. We should do more in the future."

The two major generals, Vice Political Commissar Shi Yucao and Discipline Inspection Secretary Zhang Ming, worked together with local residents to dig soil and fill pits. The farmers urged them to have a smoke, drink some water, and rest a bit before continuing, but they refused, continuing to work while chatting with the residents about their lives and production. The three major generals, Chief of Staff Liu Lunxian, Deputy Director of the Political Department Wang Yongming, and Political Commissar of the Rear Services Shi Shuizhou, worked enthusiastically on the site, digging the ground and carrying soil. The crowd, seeing them truly working hard, commented that the Party's traditional style had returned.

For the entire five to six hours, these generals did not stop working with their shovels, earnestly fulfilling their duty as ordinary soldiers to participate in assisting the people's labor.

    将军在治水工地上
    新华社记者　揭衍珍
    12月8日，江北的六合县治水改田工地上，劳动号子震天。
    上午9时，南京军区6名将军率领500多名机关干部驱车来到了工地。
    “同志们，干啊！”将军们卷起裤腿，高捋衣袖，像普通战士一样干了起来。他们当中有的已年过花甲，可干起活来十分卖劲。
    年近70岁的军区政委一锹下去硬土将锹把弹起，咬咬牙又是一锹，一连10锹也不停歇。在一起劳动的南京市委书记戴顺智劝他不要干得太急。他说：“多年不干这种活了，军委规定，从1990年起，全军每人每年义务参加国家经济建设的劳动时间不得少于10天，以后要多干才是。”
    军区副政委史玉孝、纪委书记张明两位中将，同当地群众一起刨土、填坑。农民们劝他们吸烟、喝杯水，歇歇再干，他们不肯，还边劳动边与群众拉家常、谈生产。年富力强的司令部参谋长刘伦贤、政治部副主任王永明、后勤部政委史水洲3位少将，在工地上挖地、挑土干得很欢。群众看到他们真干，议论说，党的传统作风又回来了。
    整整五六个小时，这些将军手不离锹，认真履行了一个普通军人参加助民劳动的义务。
