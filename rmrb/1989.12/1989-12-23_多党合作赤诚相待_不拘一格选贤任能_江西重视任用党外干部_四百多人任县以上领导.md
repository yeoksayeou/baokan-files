In the current leadership ranks of Jiangxi Province, there are 473 non-party cadres serving in deputy county-level and above positions, including Chen Guizun, a deputy governor who is also the vice chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL).

According to relevant departments, these non-party cadres who have entered the ranks of Jiangxi's mid-to-high-level cadre team come from various democratic parties and non-partisan groups, including the CDL, China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), and China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA). Most of them are experts and scholars in various scientific fields, with rich knowledge and both moral integrity and talent. The tide of reform and opening up has propelled them to leadership positions.

Hu Jianping, director of the cadre department of the Jiangxi Provincial United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the appointment of non-party cadres, like the promotion of party members, is conducted according to the "four modernizations" standards: revolutionary, knowledgeable, specialized, and young.

From the experience of these non-party cadres participating in politics over the past few years, diligence, pragmatism, and a willingness to learn are their common characteristics.

Chen Guizun, now 58 years old, was formerly the vice president and associate professor of Jiangxi Institute of Metallurgy. After becoming a deputy governor, he addressed his weaknesses in macro management and decision-making experience by reading a large number of relevant books. Additionally, he spends two months each year conducting field investigations and writing articles such as "Some Issues in Current Agricultural Engineering" and "Establishing a Technical Market with Chinese Characteristics." Over the past five years, his oversight of the science, education, culture, health, and sports sectors has yielded frequent good news. The formation of rural technical markets and the implementation of the "Science and Technology for Agriculture" plan have ensured good harvests year after year despite frequent natural disasters. The family planning policy has been gradually implemented, reducing the population by nearly 3 million. Education, which was previously weak, has also seen significant improvements. The rate of dangerous classrooms in primary and secondary schools has decreased from 15% in 1985 to less than 3%.

Yuchanglin, a member of the Chinese Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), is the deputy mayor of "Porcelain Capital" Jingdezhen. In his eight years in office, he has consistently managed the city's commerce, taxation, and other work, earning praise from the public.

Non-party cadres participating in politics have received support and trust from the main leaders of various levels of party committees and governments, and the majority of the masses respect them.

The practice of appointing non-party cadres to real positions is gradually becoming institutionalized in Jiangxi Province. Various levels of party committees have included the assessment and cultivation of non-party reserve cadres in their important agendas. To improve the quality of non-CPC party member cadres, the provincial United Front Work Department has established training classes for non-party cadres and the Jiangxi Institute of Socialism, focusing on teaching Marxist-Leninist theory and management science knowledge.

    多党合作赤诚相待　不拘一格选贤任能
    江西重视任用党外干部  四百多人任县以上领导
    新华社南昌12月21日电（记者陈瑶）在目前江西省的各级领导层里，已有473位党外干部担任副县级以上领导职务，其中副省长陈癸尊是民盟江西省委副主委。
    据有关部门介绍，这些跻身于江西中高级干部队伍的党外干部，分别来自民盟、民进、农工民主党等民主党派及无党派。他们大多是某一科学领域的专家、学者，知识丰富，德才兼备。改革开放的大潮将他们推上领导岗位。
    中共江西省委统战部干部处处长胡剑平说，任用党外干部同提拔党员干部一样，都是按照“四化”标准，即革命化、知识化、专业化和年轻化来遴选的。
    从这些党外干部参政几年的情况来看，勤奋、务实、好学是他们共同的特点。
    今年58岁的陈癸尊原为江西冶金学院副院长、副教授。担任副省长以后，他针对自己宏观管理和决策经验不足的弱点，大量阅读有关书籍。此外，每年还抽出两个月时间，到基层搞调查研究，撰写了《当前农业工程学中的若干问题》、《建立具有中国特色的技术市场》等文章。5年来，他分管的科教文卫体各行业捷报频传。农村技术市场的形成和“科技兴农”计划的实施，使全省农业在自然灾害不断的情况下，连年获得好收成。计划生育政策逐步落实，全省少出生近300万人口。基础较弱的教育也今非昔比。令人担忧的中小学危房率已由1985年的15％减少到3％以下。
    民建成员喻长林是“瓷都”景德镇的副市长。他在任8年，一直主管财贸，把这个百万人口城市的商业、税务等工作管理得井井有条，受到广大市民好评。
    党外干部参政议政，受到各级党委和政府的主要负责人支持和信任，绝大多数群众也尊重他们。
    安排党外干部任实职正逐步在江西省形成制度。各级党委已将考核、培养党外后备干部队伍列入重要议事日程。为了提高非中共党员干部素质，省委统战部还开办了党外干部培训班，成立了江西社会主义学院，着重传授马克思列宁主义理论和管理科学知识。
