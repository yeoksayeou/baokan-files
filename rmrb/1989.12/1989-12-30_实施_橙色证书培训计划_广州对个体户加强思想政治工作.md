Guangzhou is currently home to 98,000 registered individual households, employing 157,000 people. The city has implemented the "Orange Program" to strengthen ideological and political work among this group, achieving good results after more than three years of exploration.

The "Orange Program," officially known as the "Orange Certificate Training Program," was jointly launched in July 1986 by the Municipal Committee of Propaganda, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Individual Laborers' Association. Individual laborers who undergo training and pass the examination are awarded an orange-covered certificate.

Since the program's implementation, over 50,000 individual laborers, who previously had limited access to education, have received training. Relevant departments have provided them with systematic education in political theory, professional ethics, and law-abiding behavior. Over 30,000 individual laborers have passed the examination and received the orange-covered certificates.

Over the past three years, the program has yielded significant results, notably in raising the ideological and political awareness of the city's individual laborers, who have withstood various tests. During the turmoil in May and June this year, not a single individual household in the city engaged in so-called "support" or "demonstrations." Instead, they collectively pledged not to profiteer from the chaos or disrupt the market. Many individual laborers also donated money and sent messages of support to the capital's martial law troops, standing out clearly.

In their daily operations, individual laborers are increasingly embracing civilized business practices and honest dealings, with a heightened awareness of tax compliance.

    实施“橙色证书培训计划”
    广州对个体户加强思想政治工作
    本报广州12月28日电　记者梁兆明报道：广州市目前在册登记的个体户已达9.8万户，从业人员15.7万多人。该市为加强对这支队伍的思想政治工作而实施的“橙色计划”，经过3年多来的探索，取得了良好效果。
    “橙色计划”全称为“橙色证书培训计划”，是1986年7月由市委宣传部、市工商局和市个体劳动者协会共同实施的。接受培训的个体劳动者经过考试合格，发给橙色封面的证书。
    这一计划实施后，原苦于接受教育无门的个体劳动者已有5万多户的业主接受了培训。有关部门以比较正规的教学形式，对他们进行政治理论、职业道德、遵纪守法等方面的教育，其中3万多个体户业主经过考试合格，领取了橙色封面的证书。
    实施这一计划3年多来，取得的效果突出表现在：全市个体劳动者队伍的思想政治觉悟不断提高，并经受住考验。今年5、6月间发生的动乱中，全市的个体户不但没有人拉旗号搞所谓“声援”、“示威”，而且纷纷表示决不哄抬物价，扰乱市场发“动乱财”。许多个体户还主动给首都戒严部队捐款、发慰问电，旗帜鲜明。
    在个体户的日常经营中，文明经商、诚实做生意的风气开始形成，完税的自觉性提高。
