		Tian Jiyun, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, emphasized during his inspection of the countryside in Guizhou that poor regions must undertake comprehensive development. He stressed the need for planned and focused treatment of mountains, water, forests, fields, soil, and roads, and to strive to break the vicious cycle of food, population, and ecology.

		According to reports from Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Long Wenbin and Pan Didu, Tian Jiyun inspected several counties, districts, townships, and villages in the regions of Zunyi, Anshun, and Bijie in Guizhou Province from December 8 to 12. He visited fields and farmhouses, held talks with local officials, and listened to reports from the provincial Party committee and government on agricultural comprehensive development plans. He also delivered an important speech.

		Tian Jiyun said that Guizhou's grain production has been stagnant in recent years. Although this year saw a harvest of 7.08 billion kilograms, the second-highest since 1984, rapid population growth and ecological degradation have made it one of the provinces with the lowest per capita grain production in the country. Compared to the national situation, Guizhou's agricultural situation, especially grain production, is very severe, with significant development difficulties. Agriculture has become the main constraint on the province's economic development.

		Tian Jiyun, based on the situation he observed during this inspection, pointed out that to break the vicious cycle of food, population, and ecology, Guizhou must take the path of agricultural comprehensive development. He said that while Guizhou faces difficulties in this regard, it also has potential and experience, making it very promising. Currently, out of the province's 28 million mu of arable land, 70% is low-yielding. This part of the land has low yields, and efforts must be made to further increase production. If, through a few years of effort, the province can expand the existing 6.8 million mu of high-yield stable fields to about 14 million mu, achieving half a mu of high-yield stable farmland per person, combined with scientific and technological input to increase the yield per unit area of other farmland, the food problem can be alleviated and gradually solved. Additionally, Guizhou's vast barren mountains and hills can be developed through small watershed management, afforestation, and grass planting, implementing a combination of forest-grain intercropping, protective forests, timber forests, and economic forests. This will solve the problem of water and soil erosion while increasing grain and various agricultural and specialty products. Some barren waters can also be developed and utilized. In agricultural comprehensive development, various places have created good experiences suitable for local conditions, which should be summarized and promoted.

		Tian Jiyun also emphasized that to carry out agricultural comprehensive development, it is essential to thoroughly implement the decisions of the Fifth Plenary Session, continue to deepen rural reforms, implement stable rural policies, and stabilize the minds of 800 million farmers. This issue is crucial and must be highly regarded. Special attention should be paid to protecting the enthusiasm of the vast number of grassroots cadres. Only in this way can they lead the masses to complete various tasks. In agricultural comprehensive development, leadership must pay attention, concentrate forces, raise funds through multiple channels, plan unified, tackle easy tasks first, and emphasize efficiency. For newly developed barren mountains and hills, various forms of appropriate scale management should be adopted, establish and improve township and village collective economies, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of household operations through socialized services.

		Accompanying Tian Jiyun on the inspection were Wang Chaowen, Deputy Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and Governor, Liu Zhongyi, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, and others.

    田纪云在贵州农村视察时强调
    贫困地区要搞综合开发
    有计划有重点治理山水林田土路
    努力摆脱粮食人口生态恶性循环
    本报贵阳12月13日电　新华社记者龙文彬、本报记者潘帝都报道：中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理田纪云在视察贵州农村时强调，贫困地区要打破农业生产的徘徊局面，逐步提高粮食自给水平，必须有计划、有重点实行山、水、林、田、土、路全面综合治理，把农业开发、生态建设以及控制人口紧密地结合起来，开辟出一条新的路子。
    田纪云于12月8日至12日先后视察了贵州省遵义、安顺、毕节3个地区的一些县、区、乡、村，深入田边地头访问农户，与基层干部进行座谈。他还听取了省委、省政府关于农业综合开发方案的汇报，并作了重要讲话。
    田纪云说，贵州粮食生产近几年来连续出现了徘徊的局面，今年虽然达到70.8亿公斤，为1984年后第二个丰收年，但由于人口增长过快，生态环境恶化，仍然是全国人均粮食少的省份。与全国比较，贵州农业形势，特别是粮食生产形势十分严峻，发展难度大，农业已经成为制约全省经济发展的主要问题。
    田纪云联系这次考察中了解到的情况指出，贵州要摆脱粮食、人口、生态的恶性循环，必须走农业综合开发的道路。他说，在这方面贵州既有困难，也有潜力、有经验，因而是很有希望的。目前全省2800多万亩耕地中，70％是中低产田，这部分耕地单产低，要下决心把产量进一步提高。如果全省通过几年的努力，把现有的680万亩高产稳产耕地扩大到1400万亩左右，达到每人半亩高产稳产农田，再加上科技投入，提高其他耕地单位面积产量，解决吃饭问题就可以缓解并逐步解决。此外，贵州大面积的荒山、荒坡可以通过小流域治理，植树造林、种草，实行林粮间作，防护林、用材林、经济林并举，既解决水土流失问题，又能增产粮食及多种农特产品。还有一部分荒水也可以开发利用。在农业综合开发上，各地都创造了一些适宜本地实际情况的好经验，要把这些经验加以总结和推广。
    田纪云还强调，搞好农业综合开发，一定要认真贯彻执行五中全会通过的《决定》，继续深化农村改革，执行稳定的农村政策，稳定8亿农民的心，这个问题事关大局，一定要高度重视。特别要注意保护广大基层干部的积极性，只有这样，才能依靠他们带领广大群众去完成各项任务。在农业综合开发中，一定要领导重视，集中力量，多渠道统筹资金，统一规划，先易后难，讲究效益。要对新开发的荒山荒坡，采取多种形式的适度规模经营，建立和完善乡村集体经济，通过社会化服务把家庭经营的积极性充分调动起来。
    随同田纪云同志视察的有：中共贵州省委副书记、省长王朝文，国家计委副主任刘中一等。
