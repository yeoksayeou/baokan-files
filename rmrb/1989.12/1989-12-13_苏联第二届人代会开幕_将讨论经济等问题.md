The second session of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies opened today in the Kremlin.

The Soviet newspaper *Izvestia* said on Monday that the congress will discuss measures to normalize the Soviet economy, steps for economic reform, and the principles for drafting the 13th Five-Year Plan (1991-1995).

The agenda for this session, which is expected to last 10 days, also includes: amending and supplementing the relevant parts of the Soviet Constitution regarding the electoral system, reviewing the law on constitutional supervision, electing the Soviet Constitutional Supervision Committee, and drafting measures to combat organized crime.

In the recently concluded second session of the Soviet Parliament, some had proposed including the issue of whether to abolish Article 6 of the Constitution, which states that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the leading force in Soviet society, in the agenda for this congress. This proposal did not gain the support of the majority of deputies.

The Soviet economy has faced difficulties this year. The projected growth rate of national income will not exceed 2.5%, the lowest since the war. The fiscal deficit is 120 billion rubles (approximately $19.35 billion). The national debt is 400 billion rubles (approximately $64.52 billion), exceeding half of the annual national income. Foreign debt stands at $60 billion. Out of 1,000 major consumer goods, nearly 900 are frequently out of stock, leading to a severe shortage of consumer goods.

The first session of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies was held from May 25 to June 9 this year in Moscow.

    苏联第二届人代会开幕
    将讨论经济等问题
    新华社莫斯科12月12日电  （记者盛世良）第2届苏联人代会今天在克里姆林宫开幕。
    苏联《消息报》星期一说，大会将讨论苏联经济正常化的措施、经济改革的步骤和制订第13个五年计划（1991—1995）的原则。
    预计要开10天的本届人代会的其他议程有：对苏联宪法有关选举制度的部分作增补修改，审议宪法监督法，选举苏联宪法监督委员会，制订打击团伙犯罪的措施。
    在不久前闭会的苏联议会第2次会议上，有人曾主张把是否取消关于苏共是苏联社会中的领导作用的宪法第6条列为本届人代会议程，这一建议没有获得多数议员的支持。
    苏联今年经济发展不顺利，国民收入增长率预计不会高于2.5％，是战后以来最低的增长率；财政赤字达1200亿卢布（合1935亿美元）；国债4000亿卢布（合6452亿美元），超过半年的国民收入；外债600亿美元；1000种主要消费品中，经常脱销的近900种，消费品严重短缺。
    苏联首届人代会是今年5月25日至6月9日在莫斯科举行的。
