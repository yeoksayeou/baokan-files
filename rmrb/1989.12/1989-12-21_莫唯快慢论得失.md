During the economic restructuring, township and village enterprises are facing new challenges. A number of enterprises will be closed or merged, and many enterprises will find it difficult to achieve their original plans in terms of development speed and profit margins.

Faced with this changing situation, how should we weigh the pros and cons? This is a question that requires careful consideration. Marxist dialectical materialism tells us: the development and changes of any matter are determined by the various objective conditions closely related to that matter, not by people's subjective wishes. Township and village enterprises are no exception. We cannot simply judge success and failure by speed. Indeed, the development speed of township and village enterprises has slowed down. However, whether from the perspective of the overall economic development or from the perspective of the future development of township and village enterprises themselves, this "retreat" is actually a strategic adjustment, which is not a bad thing but a good thing.

This "retreat" can squeeze out the water content. In recent years, township and village enterprises have developed rapidly, playing an important role in changing China's economic structure, especially in the development of rural economies. However, there are significant issues with speed and efficiency. These issues need to be addressed so that we can realistically evaluate the historical position and role of township and village enterprises and correctly formulate our development strategies. Now, through adjustments, we can eliminate the excessive and irrational development, making the enterprises more solid and capable of healthy development.

This "retreat" can also ensure that the economic restructuring measures are implemented. Township and village enterprises indeed have problems in their development. Some ignore objective conditions and rush into projects; some disregard overall interests and make arbitrary local policies; some violate regulations and engage in illegal activities. If these issues are not seriously addressed, township and village enterprises themselves will struggle to develop normally, and adjustments to industrial structure, technology, and capital structure will be difficult to achieve, also affecting the deepening of the overall economic restructuring.

Of course, the "retreat" must be handled carefully. First, decisions must be made promptly to seize the initiative. Second, different situations must be treated differently, and specific measures must be implemented for each enterprise. For each enterprise, including each product, a thorough investigation and analysis should be conducted, and specific measures should be implemented based on the situation. Third, the work must be done thoroughly, leaving no loose ends. For enterprises undergoing adjustments, detailed work must be done, including asset verification, debt settlement, personnel placement, and property transfer. Thought education must also be conducted from beginning to end. For enterprises that are retained, further structural adjustments and technological transformations should be carried out, and management and operational styles should be improved. The thought and leadership of the enterprises should be rectified, truly promoting the healthy development of township and village enterprises through adjustments, restructuring, transformation, and improvement.

    莫唯快慢论得失
    徐恒足
    在治理整顿中，乡镇企业受到新的考验，一批企业将关停并转，相当多的企业在发展速度、创利数额等方面都无法实现原来的计划。
    面对这种变化了的形势，怎样权衡得失？是必须冷静思考的问题。马克思主义唯物辩证法告诉我们：任何事物的发展变化是由与该事物紧密联系的种种客观条件决定的，而不是由人们的主观愿望决定的。乡镇企业也是如此，我们不能简单地以快慢论得失。诚然，目前乡镇企业的发展速度的确放慢了。但无论从整个经济发展的全局看，还是从乡镇企业自身的发展前途看，这种“退缩”实际是一种战略性的调整，不是坏事，而是好事。
    这一“退”，可以挤掉水份。这些年来，乡镇企业确有很大发展，对改变我国经济结构，特别对于农村经济的发展，具有重要意义。但在速度和效益方面存在很大的水份。这些水份不挤掉，我们就不能实事求是地估价乡镇企业的历史地位和作用，也不能正确制订我们的发展战略。现在，通过调整，把那些盲目发展的水份挤掉，就等于一个浮肿病人消了肿，就会变实在了，能够走上健康发展的道路。
    这一“退”，可以把治理整顿的措施落到实处。乡镇企业在发展中确实存有乱的问题。有的不顾主客观条件，乱上项目；有的不顾全局利益，乱订“土政策”；有的有章不循，违法乱纪。这些如不认真整治，乡镇企业本身难以正常发展，产业结构、技术结构、资金结构的调整难以实现，也影响整个治理整顿工作的深入。
    当然，“退”要稳妥。一是要当机立断，争取主动。二是要区别对待，逐个落实。对每个企业，包括每一个产品情况要进行深入调查，具体分析，分别情况，落实处理措施。三是要善始善终，不留尾巴。对实行调整的企业要做细致的工作，既要做好资产核实，债权债务处理，人员消化、产权转移等工作，也要由始至终做好思想教育工作。对保留的企业要进一步搞好结构调整和技术改造，认真改进经营管理和经营作风，整顿好思想和领导班子，真正通过调整、整顿、改造、提高，促使乡镇企业在新的基础上健康发展。
