From the Four Corners

    A new "Mass Code" has been developed by Chen Daiyu, a national-level expert at the Sichuan Provincial Economic Information Center. This coding system, which combines sound and shape, is close to traditional Chinese character theory, making it easy to learn, remember, and use, thus highly suitable for popularization and promotion. It also features significant innovations in the definition of Chinese character components, the decomposition of characters, and the coding of components.
