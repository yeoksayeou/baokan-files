Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th.

An official from the Central Organization Department answers questions from Xinhua News Agency on several issues related to enterprise party work. The "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Party Building" clearly defined the status, tasks, and role of enterprise party organizations, and local authorities are now earnestly implementing it. During the study and discussion, some questions have been raised. Our reporter visited the official from the Central Organization Department to discuss how to understand and solve these problems.

Q: Why is it said that the enterprise party organization is the political core of the enterprise?

A: The enterprise party organization being the political core is determined by the status, nature, and historical mission of the party. This is not a new issue. In recent years, influenced by Zhao Ziyang's serious mistake of weakening the party's leadership and ideological and political work, this issue has become blurred and needs to be clarified.

Why is the enterprise party organization the political core? Firstly, the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the working class. We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. The enterprise is where the working class is most concentrated, and the enterprise party organization should naturally become the political core that unites the broad masses of workers to implement the party's line and ensure that the enterprise develops in a socialist direction.

Secondly, our party is the ruling party. The party's leadership is not only realized through central and local organizations but also through countless grassroots organizations. The enterprise party organization plays the role of a fighting fortress, and party members play the role of vanguards and models. Only then can the party's line, principles, and policies be implemented in the enterprise. The party's cohesion, attraction, and combat effectiveness can be enhanced.

Thirdly, our socialist enterprises are not only economic organizations that produce high-quality products to meet social needs but also bear certain social management functions. Doing a good job in ideological and political work and cultivating socialist new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline is an important political task for enterprise party organizations.

Therefore, the enterprise party organization, as the political core, not only does not affect the factory director responsibility system but also facilitates the implementation of the factory director responsibility system and the further improvement of the enterprise leadership system.

Q: What are the main responsibilities and tasks of the enterprise party organization as the political core?

A: We believe there are mainly the following aspects: (1) Ensuring and supervising the implementation of party and state policies in the enterprise, adhering to the socialist direction of the enterprise. (2) Leading the ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction of the enterprise. (3) According to the principle of the party managing cadres, strengthening the education, cultivation, examination, and supervision of cadres, especially leading cadres, examining and recommending mid-level administrative cadres, and providing opinions and suggestions on mid-level administrative cadres nominated by the factory director. (4) Leading the workers' congress and trade unions, Communist Youth League, and other mass organizations, supporting these organizations to independently and responsibly carry out work according to laws and their respective charters. (5) Providing opinions and suggestions on major issues of the enterprise, participating in decision-making. Supporting the factory director (manager) in exercising legal authority, coordinating the relationship between the factory director and the workers' congress and mass organizations. (6) Strengthening the ideological, organizational, and style construction of the party, fully playing the role of the party organization as a fighting fortress and the vanguard and model role of party members.

Q: What is the relationship between the political core status of the enterprise party organization and the central position of the factory director?

A: From the responsibilities and tasks of the enterprise party organization mentioned earlier, it can be seen that its "political core status" is mainly about the political and ideological aspects. While the factory director, as the legal representative of the enterprise, has the "central position" mainly in terms of production and management. The "Enterprise Law" has clear regulations on the authority of the factory director. It can be said that whether it is "central" or "core," their functions are different and can be organically combined and unified. This is mainly a practical issue. Many enterprise party secretaries seriously safeguard the factory director responsibility system, actively support the factory director in exercising authority; many factory directors fully respect the opinions of the party committee, regard the full play of the party organization's role as an important guarantee for running the enterprise well. Enterprise party and government leaders, with a broad vision, work according to their respective responsibilities, support each other, respect each other, cooperate closely, and work together, and they will definitely be able to run the socialist enterprise well.

Q: How should the enterprise party committee lead ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction?

A: Ideological and political work is a fine tradition and political advantage of the party, and it is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in economic work and all other work. Practice has proven that weakening or even abolishing ideological and political work, or placing the party organization in a subordinate position in ideological and political work, will inevitably have serious consequences. The struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion has further proven that enterprises must strengthen ideological and political work and must play the leading role of enterprise party organizations in this regard.

Based on the successful experiences of various places, the enterprise party organization should mainly focus on the following work to lead ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction: First, formulate long-term plans and annual plans for the ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction of the enterprise according to the party's tasks and the development goals of the enterprise, and organize their implementation. Second, discuss and decide on the guiding ideology, tasks, goals, principles, methods, and team building of ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction. Third, organize and mobilize all party members to do ideological and political work. Fourth, help, guide, and coordinate the enterprise administration and trade unions, Communist Youth League, and other mass organizations to carry out ideological and political work according to their respective characteristics.

Q: What responsibilities does the factory director have for ideological and political work?

A: In the situation where the enterprise party organization leads ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction, the factory director still has important responsibilities for ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction. The factory director should timely report the goals, tasks, and situations of the enterprise's production and operation in each period to the party organization and all employees, create conditions for employees to participate in democratic management, do a good job in ideological and political work in production, operation, distribution, and administrative management, combine administrative measures and economic measures with ideological education, and combine solving ideological problems with solving practical problems. Efforts should be made to cultivate the enterprise spirit, and conduct education and training on vocational ethics and vocational skills for employees. Efforts should be made in scientific, cultural, and educational work. The working conditions for ideological and political work and spiritual civilization construction in the enterprise should be guaranteed and improved.

It is necessary to emphasize that doing a good job in ideological and political work and attaching importance to spiritual civilization construction is a necessary quality for the director of a socialist enterprise. Without paying attention to this aspect of work, one cannot become a qualified factory director. We are pleased to see that many factory directors have done a good job in this regard, and we hope they will continue to summarize and accumulate experience.

Q: How is the appointment of mid-level administrative cadres by the party and government leadership collective implemented?

A: The "Enterprise Law" stipulates that the factory director has the right to appoint or hire and dismiss mid-level administrative leaders. The appointment and removal of cadres should go through certain procedures and should not be decided by an individual. Our party has always been the rule that the appointment of cadres should be democratic and follow the mass line. Now it is stipulated that mid-level administrative cadres in enterprises are nominated by the factory director or recommended by the party committee, and then appointed by the factory director after discussion by the party and government leadership collective. This is to enable the factory director to select and use cadres according to the principle of both ability and integrity, and to avoid mistakes in the use of personnel. This regulation does not hinder the factory director from exercising the right to appoint personnel. As for the specific form of collective discussion, it should be based on reality and not rigidly uniform. Regardless of the form adopted, the following should be noted: (1) Before the discussion, the organization and personnel departments should conduct investigations and listen to opinions widely. (2) Before the discussion, the main party and government leaders should fully exchange opinions. (3) During the discussion, democracy should be fully exercised, and the factory director should make the appointment decision based on the opinions from the discussion.

Q: What are the principles for setting up party work institutions and configuring full-time party affairs personnel in enterprises? How is the regulation that the number of full-time party affairs and ideological and political work personnel generally does not exceed 1% of the total number of employees implemented?

A: To run a socialist enterprise well, it is necessary to set up certain specialized party work institutions and maintain a certain number of full-time party affairs and ideological and political work personnel. In terms of institution setup and personnel configuration, both the principles of being lean and efficient and the strengthening of party work and ideological and political work should be adhered to. Large and medium-sized enterprises generally have party committees that can set up disciplinary inspection commissions and organizational, propaganda, and other functional departments; small enterprises generally do not set up specialized institutions, but should have specialized personnel responsible for party work and ideological and political work. Large and medium-sized enterprises should configure full-time party committee secretaries, and if the factory director and party committee secretary are the same person, a full-time deputy secretary should be configured. Sub-factories and relatively large workshops can also configure full-time secretaries and deputy secretaries. The secretaries of small enterprises can be full-time or part-time. Part-time secretaries should spend enough time and energy on party building and ideological and political work.

The number of full-time personnel engaged in party affairs and ideological and political work in enterprises is generally configured not to exceed 1% of the total number of employees. According to the actual situation of the enterprise, some enterprises may have less than 1%; some enterprises, with dispersed employees and high work mobility, may have slightly more than 1%. The configuration ratio of full-time cadres of trade unions and Communist Youth League in enterprises is implemented according to relevant regulations.

    中组部负责人就企业党的工作答新华社记者问
    企业党组织是企业的政治核心
    新华社北京12月24日电　中组部负责人就企业党的工作的几个问题答新华社记者问。
    《中共中央关于加强党的建设的通知》明确了企业党组织的地位、任务和作用，各地正在认真贯彻执行。在学习讨论中，大家也提出一些问题。本社记者就此访问了中组部负责人，请他谈谈如何认识和解决这些问题。
    问：为什么说企业党组织是企业的政治核心？
    答：企业党组织是政治核心，这是由党的地位、性质和它所担负的历史任务决定的，本来不是什么新问题。前几年，受赵紫阳同志严重削弱党的领导和思想政治工作的错误影响，这个问题变得模糊了，有必要加以澄清。
    企业党组织为什么是政治核心？首先，中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队。我们必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。企业是工人群众最集中的地方，企业党组织理应成为团结广大工人群众执行党的路线，保证企业沿着社会主义方向发展的政治核心。
    第二，我们党是执政党。党的领导作用不仅通过中央和地方组织，而且通过千千万万个基层组织去实现。企业党组织发挥战斗堡垒作用，党员发挥先锋模范作用，党的路线、方针、政策，才能在企业最终得到落实。党的凝聚力、吸引力、战斗力才有可能得到增强。
    第三，我国社会主义企业既是经济组织，要生产高质量的商品，以满足社会需要，又担负一定的社会管理职能。做好思想政治工作，培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人，是企业党组织的重要政治任务。
    因此，企业党组织作为政治核心，不仅不影响厂长负责制，相反，有利于厂长负责制的实行，有利于企业领导体制的进一步完善。
    问：企业党组织作为政治核心，主要担负哪些职责、任务？
    答：我们认为，主要有以下几个方面：（一）保证、监督党和国家各项方针政策在本企业的贯彻执行，坚持企业的社会主义方向。（二）领导企业的思想政治工作和精神文明建设。（三）按照党管干部的原则，加强对干部特别是领导干部的教育、培养、考察和监督，考察和推荐中层行政干部，对厂长提名的中层行政干部提出意见和建议。（四）领导职工代表大会和工会、共青团等群众组织，支持这些组织依照法律和各自的章程独立负责地开展工作。（五）对企业的重大问题提出意见和建议，参与决策。支持厂长（经理）依法行使职权，协调厂长与职代会及群众组织的关系。（六）搞好党的思想、组织、作风建设，充分发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。
    问：企业党组织的政治核心地位与厂长的中心地位是什么关系？
    答：从前面讲到的企业党组织的职责、任务可以看出，其“政治核心地位”主要是从政治思想方面说的。而厂长作为企业的法定代表人，其
  “中心地位”主要是从生产经营管理方面说的。对于厂长的职权，《企业法》已有明确规定。应该说，“中心”也好，“核心”也好，二者职能不同，应当而且完全可以有机地结合和统一起来。这主要是一个实践问题。许多企业党委书记认真维护厂长负责制，积极支持厂长行使职权；许多厂长充分尊重党委的意见，把党组织充分发挥作用看成是办好企业的重要保证。企业党政领导都胸怀全局，按照各自的职责进行工作，互相支持，互相尊重，紧密配合，齐心协力，就一定能把社会主义企业办好。
    问：企业党委如何领导思想政治工作和精神文明建设？
    答：思想政治工作是党的优良传统和政治优势，是做好经济工作和其他一切工作的根本保证。实践证明，削弱以至取消思想政治工作，或者在思想政治工作中把党组织置于协助、从属的地位，必然造成严重后果。制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争更加证明了企业必须加强思想政治工作，必须发挥企业党组织在这方面的领导作用。
    根据各地成功的经验，企业党组织领导思想政治工作和精神文明建设主要应抓好以下几项工作：第一，根据党的任务和企业的发展目标，制定企业思想政治工作和精神文明建设的长远规划、年度计划，并组织实施。第二，讨论决定思想政治工作和精神文明建设中的指导思想、任务目标、方针方法和队伍建设等重大问题。第三，组织和动员全体党员做思想政治工作。第四，帮助、指导和协调企业行政与工会、共青团等群众组织根据各自的特点，开展思想政治工作。
    问：厂长对思想政治工作负有什么责任？
    答：在企业党组织领导思想政治工作和精神文明建设的情况下，厂长对思想政治工作和精神文明建设仍负有重要责任。厂长应把每个时期本企业生产经营的目标、任务和情况、问题及时向党组织和全体职工通报，为职工参与民主管理创造条件，做好生产、经营、分配和行政管理工作中的思想政治工作，把行政手段、经济手段同思想教育结合起来，把解决思想问题同解决实际问题结合起来。要努力培育企业精神，对职工进行职业道德、职业技能的教育和培训。要做好有关科学、文化、教育等方面的工作。要保证、改善企业思想政治工作和精神文明建设的工作条件。
    这里需要强调指出，做好思想政治工作和重视精神文明建设，是社会主义企业的厂长必备的素质。不重视这方面的工作，不可能成为一个称职的厂长。我们高兴地看到，许多厂长在这方面是做得好的，希望他们不断总结和积累经验。
    问：企业中层行政干部由党、政领导集体讨论，如何实施？
    答：《企业法》规定厂长有权任免或者聘任、解聘中层行政领导干部。干部的任免要经过一定的程序，不要只由个人说了算。我们党历来的规矩是，任用干部要发扬民主，走群众路线。现在规定企业中层行政干部由厂长提名，或党委推荐，经党、政领导集体讨论后，由厂长任免，是为了使厂长按照德才兼备的原则选好用好干部，避免用人上的失误。这一规定，并不妨碍厂长行使用人权。至于集体讨论的具体形式，要从实际出发，不强求一律。无论采取何种形式，均须注意：（一）讨论前由组织、人事部门进行考察，广泛听取意见。（二）党政主要领导同志在讨论前充分交换意见。（三）讨论中充分发扬民主，根据讨论的意见，由厂长作出任免决定。
    问：企业党的工作机构设置和专职党务工作人员配备的原则是什么？如何具体执行专职党务工作和思想政治工作人员一般不超过职工总数1％的规定？
    答：要办好社会主义企业，需要设置一定的党的工作专门机构，保持一定数量的专职党务工作和思想政治工作人员队伍。在工作机构设置和人员配备上，既要坚持精干、高效的原则，又要有利于加强党的工作和思想政治工作。大中型企业党组织一般可设纪委和组织、宣传等职能部门；小型企业党组织一般可不设专职机构，但应有专人负责党的工作和思想政治工作。大中型企业应配备专职党委书记，厂长和党委书记由一人担任的，应配备专职副书记。分厂和较大车间，有的也可配备专职书记和副书记。小型企业的书记，可以专职，也可兼职。兼职书记要用足够的时间和精力来抓党的建设和思想政治工作。
    企业专职从事党务工作和思想政治工作的人员，一般按不超过职工总数的1％配备。根据企业的实际情况，有些企业可少于1％；有些企业，职工分散、工作流动性大，也可略高于1％。企业工会、共青团专职干部的配备比例，按有关规定执行。
