	Exploring Land Management and Optimization Development Models: 12 Pilot Counties Show Significant Results

	From our reporter Li Erliang in Nanyang: It has been learned from the national land development and treatment work conference held here that since the beginning of 1986, the national land development and treatment work, through the efforts of all parties, has achieved initial results.

	In view of China's situation of limited land and relatively scarce resources, since the central government decided in 1981 to carry out land treatment, planning, and legislation, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have attached great importance to it. In 1986, the State Planning Commission selected 12 counties nationwide as pilot projects for small-area land development and treatment, divided into five types: comprehensive development and treatment of mountainous areas, small watershed treatment, grassland development and treatment, desertification treatment, and comprehensive development and treatment of tidal flats. These pilot counties, with the goals of rationally developing and utilizing resources, improving the ecological environment, achieving ecological balance, and improving people's living standards, combined mountain treatment and water conservation with the vigorous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, highlighting their respective priorities, and achieving the goals of low investment, quick results, and significant effects. These pilot experiences have played a demonstrative role in China's exploration of land management and optimization development models, formulation of regional economic development strategies and plans, and comprehensive utilization of natural resources.

    探索国土治理与优化开发模式
    全国12个试点县效果显著
    本报南阳电　记者李而亮从此间召开的全国国土开发整治工作会议上获悉：从1986年开始的全国国土开发整治工作，经过各方3年的努力，已取得初步成效。
    根据我国地少人多，资源相对贫乏的状况，自1981年中央作出要搞好国土整治、要搞规划、要立法的决定以来，各省、市、自治区都十分重视。国家计委于1986年在全国范围内选择了12个县，作为全国小区域国土开发整治的试点，分作山区综合开发整治、小流域治理、草原开发治理、沙荒地治理和滩涂资源综合开发治理等5个类型。这些试点县以合理开发利用资源，改变生态环境，实现生态良性循环和提高人民生活水平为目标，把整山治水与大力发展农林牧副渔业结合起来，突出各自重点，达到了投资省、见效快和效果显著的目的。这些试点经验为我国探索国土治理与优化开发模式、制定区域性经济发展战略规划、综合利用自然资源等，起了示范作用。
