**Warmth Like Home**

When the delegation led by Kobayashi Koichi arrived at the Beijing Baile Hotel at midnight on the 12th, the welcoming hostesses had been waiting for a long time. Each guest was presented with a vibrant rose. The guests placed the flowers in small vases already prepared in their rooms, instantly filling the rooms with springtime vibes and making the guests forget the cold of Beijing winter.

General Manager Li Qinghu and the department managers had also been waiting for the Japanese Go delegation. When they presented hot, steaming noodle soup, the weary guests' faces lit up, and their appetites returned.

**Abandoning the Car, Walking**

It is said that the hotel is only one stop away from the China-Japan Friendship Go Institute. Before the first match, Kobayashi Koichi, who enjoys walking, decided to walk to the venue instead of taking a car.

Kobayashi Koichi strolled along, enjoying the morning commute of Beijing's cyclists, and before he knew it, he had arrived. He entered the institute almost at the same time as the van carrying Ma Xiaochun and others.

**Self-Regulation**

After losing the first match, Ma Xiaochun spent the evening and the next morning playing snooker at the hotel. Although his snooker "record was not good," those watching understood: he was not concerned with winning or losing; he was mainly regulating himself for the second match.

**“Forget-Me-Not”**

In the three-story building of the China-Japan Friendship Go Institute, careful observers noticed flowers everywhere inside and outside the venue. These were specially prepared by the Beijing Forget-Me-Not Florist Shop for the second China-Japan Go Masters' Cup.

The special small flower basket given to Ma Xiaochun had the donor's wish written on it: "Wish you victory."

**Little Computer**

Just fifteen minutes after the match ended, a clear and accurate game record was delivered to the players of both sides and the reporters from both countries, leaving everyone amazed.

It turned out to be the work of Yu Bin. In his spare time, he studied computers and became a well-known "computer enthusiast" in the national Go team. This time, he finally had a chance to "show his skills."

    名人战拾零
            温　暖　如　家
    小林光一一行七人十二日抵达北京百乐酒店时已是午夜，恭候多时的欢迎小姐向每位来宾送上一枝鲜艳的月季花，客人们来到客房把它插入早已准备好的小花瓶中，顿时使房间充满春意，使客人们忘却了北京冬天的寒冷。
    总经理李庆虎率领各部门经理也一直在等候日本围棋代表团，当他们送上热气腾腾的汤面时，疲劳了一天的客人喜形于色，胃口大开。
            弃　车　步　行
    听说酒店距中日友好围棋会馆只有一站多路，喜欢散步的小林光一参加首局比赛前，决定弃车步行至赛场。
    小林光一一边欣赏着北京早晨上班的自行车“洪流”，一边悠然迈步向前。不知不觉间就走到了，与马晓春等人乘坐的面包车几乎同时进入会馆。
            自　我　调　节
    马晓春首战失利后，当晚和第二天上午都在酒店打起司诺克台球。尽管他的台球“战绩欠佳”，旁观者心里都明白：他并不在乎胜负，主要是进行自我调节，为第二盘比赛做准备。
              “勿　忘　我”
    中日友好围棋会馆的三层小楼内，细心人发现赛场内外到处可见鲜花。这是北京勿忘我鲜花礼品店专门为中信杯第二届中日围棋名人战准备的。送给马晓春的特制小花篮上面写着赠者的心愿——祝君得胜。
            小　电　脑
    比赛刚结束十五分钟，一份清晰准确的棋谱就送到了双方棋手和两国记者的手中，令大家惊叹不已。
    原来，这是俞斌的“大作”。他在业余时间钻研电脑，成为国家围棋队有名的“电脑迷”，这次终于有了“用武之地   ”。菲菲
