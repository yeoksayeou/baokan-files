Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 30th - Reporter Xú Bǎokāng reports: The spokesperson for the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today, proposing three suggestions to halt military exercises. The aim is to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, promote dialogue between the North and South, and urge the United States and the South Korean authorities to agree to hold three-party talks on making the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone.

The three suggestions proposed by the spokesperson are: first, starting from January 1, 1990, halt all military exercises involving the movement of nuclear weapons and equipment capable of carrying nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters; second, halt large-scale military exercises involving divisions and above in the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters; third, the military forces of the North and South should not conduct joint military exercises with foreign forces in the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters, nor should they conduct joint military exercises with foreign forces overseas.

The spokesperson said that on November 9, the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement proposing that North Korea, the United States, and South Korea hold three-party talks this year to discuss the issue of making the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone. However, the U.S. authorities have yet to respond to the North's proposal.

The spokesperson said that to create a climate of trust for the three-party talks and to have a positive impact on the ongoing North-South dialogue, the North believes it is necessary to take practical measures to reduce military actions. If the three suggestions can be implemented in the Korean Peninsula, it will contribute to the elimination of the threat of nuclear war.

The spokesperson expressed the hope that the U.S. and South Korean authorities would give a positive response to the North's three suggestions. The spokesperson finally hoped that the U.S. and South Korean authorities would actively respond to the North's proposals and hold three-party talks as soon as possible.

    朝鲜提出停止军事演习三建议
    停止调动核武器及运载装备的军事演习
    停止师以上部队参加的大规模军事演习
    北南方军队不同外军举行联合军事演习
    本报平壤11月30日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜外交部发言人今天发表谈话，提出有关停止军事演习的3项建议，以缓和朝鲜半岛的紧张局势，推动南北对话，并敦促美国和南朝鲜当局同意同北方就使朝鲜半岛成为无核区问题举行三方会谈。
    发言人提出的3项建议是：一、从1990年1月1日起，在朝鲜半岛及其周围海域停止调动核武器及运载核武器的装备的一切军事演习；二、在朝鲜半岛及其周围海域停止师以上部队参加的大规模军事演习；三、北方和南方的军队不在朝鲜半岛及其周围海域同外国军队举行联合军事演习，也不在海外同外国军队举行联合军事演习。
    这位发言人说，朝鲜外交部11月9日发表声明，建议朝鲜北方、美国和南朝鲜今年内举行三方会谈，讨论使朝鲜半岛成为无核区问题。但是，美国当局至今仍未对朝鲜北方的建议作出反应。
    发言人说，为创造三方会谈的信赖气氛和给正在进行的北南对话造成良好影响，北方认为应当采取减缓军事行动的实际措施。如果在朝鲜半岛实现上述三点建议就能够为消除核战争威胁作出贡献。
    发言人表示，希望美国和南朝鲜当局对北方的上述3项建议作出肯定的答复。发言人最后期望美国和南朝鲜当局积极响应北方的建议，早日举行三方会谈。
