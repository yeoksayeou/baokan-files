**Editor's Note:** Since mid-November, the State Council has issued a nationwide directive to eliminate the "six evils." Various regions have responded swiftly, working together to swiftly apprehend a large number of lawbreakers, seize a substantial amount of illegal items, rescue many women and children in distress, and save numerous individuals who have strayed from the right path. The general public has applauded these efforts.

The "six evils" refer to prostitution, the production, sale, and dissemination of obscene materials, the trafficking of women and children, the cultivation, use, and trafficking of drugs, gambling, and the use of feudal superstitions to defraud and harm people. These evils corrupt the soul, endanger social order, and poison social customs, and have always been strongly condemned and opposed by educated, moral, and conscientious individuals. Socialist China must not allow these evils to spread. This is both a necessity for social progress and a responsibility to future generations.

While completely eradicating the "six evils" is not a task that can be accomplished in a single day or battle, it requires long-term efforts, perseverance, and coordination from all parties. However, one point must be emphasized: in recent years, the increasing prevalence of these evils in some places must be stopped, and all measures must be taken to decisively halt them within a short period.

For those who do not yet fully understand the practical significance and far-reaching impact of eliminating the "six evils," reading the related letters from readers about gambling and the trafficking of women published here will be a shock, prompting them to take action and actively participate in the struggle.

In late November, I conducted an investigation into the gambling activities at the Lion's Mouth Supply and Marketing Cooperative in my county. I discovered that many employees of this cooperative are involved in gambling, with some even including entire families—husbands and wives, fathers and sons, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law—all participating. Most gamblers engage in high-stakes games, with each round of mahjong betting at least 5 yuan, and sometimes up to hundreds of yuan. On one day in March, the finance department head, Wang Jiajun, and the business employee, Zeng Xianwu, along with four others, gambled and had winnings and losses of four to five thousand yuan in a single session. The finance department accountant, Liao Zhongjun, participated in over 50 gambling sessions from February to October this year, losing more than 14,000 yuan. Gamblers would gamble wherever they went, playing at home in the evenings, in the building materials, general merchandise, hardware, and oil storage departments during the day, and even in the disease prevention and control center's wards.

The consequences of gambling for the Lion's Mouth Supply and Marketing Cooperative:

1. **Embezzlement and Misappropriation of Public Funds:** According to incomplete statistics, among the gamblers, 8 individuals used over 10,000 yuan of public funds for gambling, with some embezzling and misappropriating tens of thousands of yuan. In March, Zhu Dajun took 3,000 yuan of public funds to Shashi to purchase bedsheets but ended up gambling and losing 1,600 yuan in one day and night. He had no money left for purchases and had to borrow more public funds. The salesperson at the production materials department, Shi Yuping, lost 6,303 yuan from sales revenue through gambling from March to May and then secretly sold a typewriter worth over 600 yuan from the cooperative, which was seized by the public security authorities. The salesperson at the building materials department, Tang Houping, lost over 3,200 yuan from sales revenue and then gambled away all 2,200 yuan in cash intended for purchasing steel. Liao Zhongjun took advantage of his position as a deputy cashier to embezzle and misappropriate over 10,000 yuan of public funds, using some to buy gambling equipment and treat gambling friends to meals, squandering over 3,000 yuan, and losing the rest in gambling.

2. **Frequent Thefts:** From April to November this year, the cooperative experienced 4 thefts, with a total loss of over 5,400 yuan in cash and materials.

3. **Marital Discord and Family Breakdowns:** Among the cooperative's employees, 5 families had serious arguments due to gambling. The business employee, Li, owed 4,700 yuan in public funds due to gambling, and his wife filed for divorce. The cooperative employee, Tang, lost over 8,000 yuan to gambling, and his wife's constant arguments led Tang to attempt suicide twice by hanging, but both attempts failed.

4. **Low Morale and Poor Performance:** The deputy director and accountant of the cooperative's processing plant, Ye, was obsessed with gambling, embezzling and misappropriating over 5,000 yuan of public funds (losing over 3,000 yuan in gambling and squandering over 1,000 yuan), neglecting the management of the factory, resulting in a loss of 74,900 yuan for a small processing plant. By the end of October this year, the entire cooperative's performance had deteriorated, with an accounting loss of 37,000 yuan.

Gambling among the employees of the Lion's Mouth Supply and Marketing Cooperative began several years ago. During the rectification campaign in 1986, 36 out of 59 party members in the cooperative made self-criticisms for gambling. In 1987, 50 people were punished for gambling. Song Shanceng, the director, received a one-year probationary period for gambling, and Deputy Director Qin Yongde received a party warning for gambling. However, why has the gambling trend become more prevalent? This is related to the lack of enforcement by relevant departments. The town's major anti-gambling campaign only lasted for one week in January this year, with no further necessary measures taken. Later, the cooperative's numerous gamblers held dozens of gambling sessions, but these were often dismissed due to the actions of certain individuals.

Now, the serious consequences of gambling have drawn attention, and an anti-gambling campaign has been launched in the town.

It is understood that the spread of gambling is not limited to the Lion's Mouth Supply and Marketing Cooperative. It is suggested that all regions, in eliminating the "six evils," use political, legal, economic, and other means to thoroughly carry out anti-gambling activities.

    疯狂的赌徒　惨重的后果
    ——狮子口供销社赌博剖析
    编者按：从十一月中旬开始，国务院作出全国统一行动、扫除“六害”的部署后，各地闻风而动，通力合作，很快查处了一大批违法犯罪分子，收缴了大量不法物品，解救了许多受难的妇女儿童，挽救了不少误入歧途的失足者。广大群众对此无不拍手称快。
    “六害”，即卖淫嫖娼、制作贩卖传播淫秽物品、拐卖妇女儿童、私种吸食贩运毒品、聚众赌博和利用封建迷信骗财害人，腐蚀人的心灵，危害社会治安，毒化社会风气，历来为有教养、有道德、有良知的人所极端鄙视和坚决反对。社会主义的中国，绝不能让“六害”滋生蔓延，这既是社会文明进步的需要，也是对世世代代人的负责。
    虽然彻底根治“六害”非一日、一役之功，需要长期作战、坚持不懈、各方配合。但有一点必须引起重视：近些年来，“六害”在一些地方越来越猖獗的现象，不能再继续下去了，要采取一切办法，在较短时间里坚决制止。
    对于扫除“六害”的现实作用和深远意义还认识不清的人，读一读这里发表的有关赌博和拐卖妇女的读者来信，是会感到震惊，从而行动起来，积极参加斗争。
    11月下旬，我对本县狮子口供销社打牌赌博的情况作了调查，发现这个供销社干部职工中，参与打牌赌博的人很多，有的还是夫妻、父子、婆媳全上场同参赌。多数参赌者专搞“大场面”，打麻将每盘赌注少则5元，多则上百元。今年3月的一天，财务股长王家俊和业务员曾贤武等6人打牌赌博，一次输赢达四五千元。财务股计帐员廖中军于今年2月至10月参赌50多场，输掉1.4万多元。参赌者走到哪儿赌到哪儿，晚上在家赌，白天在建材、百货、五金、油库等门市部赌，甚至镇血防站的病房也成了他们的赌点。
    赌博给狮子口供销社带来的后果：
    有关职工贪污挪用公款严重。据不完全统计，在参赌人员中，用千元以上公款赌博者8人，贪污挪用公款达几万元。今年3月，朱大军身带3000元公款到沙市购床单，结果到沙市后参与赌博，一天两晚输掉1600元，进货无钱，只好再借公款。生产资料门市部营业员史玉平，3月至5月赌博输掉销售货款6303元，后又将社里一台价值600多元的打字机偷偷卖掉，被公安机关扣留。建材门市部营业员唐后平输掉销售货款3200余元，后又把购买钢材的2200元现金全部输光。廖中军利用代理出纳的机会，贪污、挪用公款一万余元，除用来购买赌具，请赌友上饭馆等挥霍3000多元外，其余全部输光。
    盗窃案件屡屡发生。今年4至11月，全社共被盗4次，盗走现金及物资折款达5400多元。
    家庭不和妻离子散。狮子口供销社工作人员中，因赌博造成夫妇大吵大闹的有5家，业务员李某因贪赌，欠公款4700元，李的妻子提出离婚。供销社工作人员唐某因赌输8000多元，妻子吵闹不止，唐自知理亏而两次上吊自杀未遂。
    人心涣散效益低下。供销社加工厂代理厂长兼会计叶某一心思赌，贪污、挪用公款5000多元（赌输3000多元，挥霍1000多元），无心管理工厂，造成一个小加工厂亏损7.49万元。今年全供销社效益每况愈下，到10月底，帐面亏损3.7万元。
    狮子口供销社的工作人员赌博几年前就开始了。1986年整党时，全社59名党员就有36名因赌博作检讨。1987年，全社有50人因赌博而受罚。宋善成主任因打牌赌钱受到留党察看一年的处分，副主任秦永德又因赌博受到党内警告处分。但为什么赌博之风越来越盛？这与有关部门查处不力有关，全镇大的禁赌行动只在今年1月搞了一个星期，以后没有采取必要措施。后来，这个供销社众多的赌徒数十次聚赌，但都由于某些人的活动而不了了之。
    现在，赌博造成的严重后果已引起当地重视，一场反赌禁赌活动已在这个镇展开。
    据了解，赌风蔓延远不止狮子口供销社。建议各地在扫除“六害”中，运用政治、法律、经济等多种手段，扎扎实实开展反赌禁赌活动。
