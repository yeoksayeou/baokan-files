Bhutan's King Wangchuk recently said: "We do not want our young people to confuse modernization with Westernization." It is precisely with this consideration that Bhutan is now launching a "Drilan Namcha" (meaning the revival of Bhutanese traditions and culture) movement.

The Kingdom of Bhutan is located at the southern foot of the Himalayas, with beautiful scenery and a tranquil environment, earning it the nickname "The Land of the Thunder Dragon." Before the 1960s, it was largely isolated from the world, with its people relying on pastoralism and primitive agriculture for sustenance. Before 1971, there was no currency, and people were accustomed to bartering. Before 1974, it was still a virgin land for tourism.

Since the 1960s, after opening up, Bhutan has made significant progress on the path of modernization. Now, it has roads connecting to the outside world, its own civil aviation, electricity, telephones, and satellite lines. Thirty years ago, farmers here refused to use improved seeds and fertilizers, and the government had to provide them for free, but now they compete to buy these items. Thirty years ago, the government sent some children to neighboring countries for free education, and parents were hesitant, but now many parents falsify their children's ages to send them abroad for education as early as possible. The minister in charge of planning, Dorji, said: "Bhutan has changed too much, the most fitting description of this change is: from having nothing to having everything."

However, at the same time, another situation has emerged: many young people have abandoned traditional clothing, customs, and ways of life, blindly imitating the West; some influential adults are enthusiastic about golf, while looking down on the traditional archery. An elderly person in the capital Thimphu said: "This generation no longer likes folk songs and traditional mask dances; they dance to disco music."

King Wangchuk said: "Achieving modernization is still our main goal. However, if the development is too rushed, everything in Bhutan will be eroded." For this reason, King Wangchuk initiated the "Drilan Namcha" movement nationwide, encouraging people to wear national costumes, speak the national language, love national culture and entertainment activities, and restore all traditional virtues. Currently, the "Drilan Namcha" movement has been widely responded to by the people of Bhutan. The most obvious change is that in the streets of Thimphu, men all wear "Gho," and women all wear "Kira" (national costumes), everyone speaks the national language, and the national characteristics are very distinct. Bhutan has not abandoned the goal of modernization; it is investing $6 million in the country's satellite industry. Western tourists are still strolling on the streets of Thimphu. The purpose of "Drilan Namcha," as summarized by the king, is: "What we are doing now is to ensure that Bhutan remains Bhutan."

### 不丹开展“德利兰·纳姆查”运动

    不丹开展“德利兰·纳姆查”运动
    詹得雄
    不丹国王旺楚克最近说：“我们不希望我们的年轻人把现代化同西方化混为一谈。”正是出于这种考虑，不丹现在正在开展一场“德利兰·纳姆查”（意为不丹传统与文化的复兴）运动。
    不丹王国位于喜马拉雅山南麓，景色秀丽，环境安谧，素有“神龙之国”的美称。60年代前，它基本上与世隔绝，人民靠放牧和原始农业为生。1971年以前没有货币，人们习惯以物易物。1974年以前，这里还是一块旅游业的处女地。
    60年代实行开放后，不丹在现代化道路上有了长足的进步。现在既有连接外界的公路、自己的民航，也有了电、电话和卫星线路。30年前，这里的农民拒绝用良种和化肥，政府只好免费供应，而今他们争购这些东西。30年前，政府免费送一些孩子到邻国上学，家长顾虑重重，而今许多家长为孩子虚报年龄，力争早些送出去受教育。负责计划的大臣多尔吉说：“不丹的变化太大了，描叙这种变化最贴切的一句话是：从一无所有到一切都有。”
    但是，同时也出现了另一种情况：许多年轻人抛弃了传统服装、风俗习惯和生活方式，盲目模仿西方；一些有地位的成年人，热衷于高尔夫球，而对传统的射箭不屑一顾。首都廷布的一位老人说：“这一代人已不喜欢民间歌曲和传统的假面具舞蹈了，他们跳迪斯科。”
    旺楚克国王说：“实现现代化仍是我们的主要目标。但是对发展操之过急，使不丹的一切都在受到侵蚀。”为此，旺楚克国王在全国发起“德利兰·纳姆查”运动，鼓励人民穿民族服装，讲民族语言，热爱民族文化和文娱活动，恢复一切传统的美德。目前，“德利兰·纳姆查”运动已得到广大不丹人民的响应，最明
    显的变化是，廷布街头男的都穿“巴库”，女的都穿“基拉”（民族服装），大家讲本国语言，民族特色十分鲜明。不丹并未放弃现代化目标，它正投资600万美元用于本国的卫星事业。西方旅游者也还在廷布街头游览。“德利兰·纳姆查”的目的，正如国王所概括的：“我们现在所做的一切是要确保不丹仍然是不丹。”
