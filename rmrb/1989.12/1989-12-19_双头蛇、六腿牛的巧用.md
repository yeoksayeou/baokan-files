Title: Clever Uses of Two-Headed Snakes and Six-Legged Cows

Rarity commands value. This adage is indeed a profound truth. If gold were as abundant as the stones on Mount Taihang, even if it had countless irreplaceable uses, its price would inevitably plummet like the waterfall at Mount Lu, cascading down three thousand feet. The same principle applies to animals. If a cow had six legs or a snake had two heads, their value would instantly skyrocket, and they would surely be invited by some exhibition venues to attract visitors.

Curiosity is a universal human trait. However, strangely, in recent years, some individuals in our literary and publishing circles have also mastered this trick. But instead of inviting two-headed snakes or six-legged cows, they invite a few individuals who have once made serious mistakes and caused public outrage, either for recordings or film shoots, aiming to create a sensation.

A tape titled "Tears of Regret" led us to believe it was a recording by a certain fallen film star. However, we were deceived. The singer of "Tears of Regret" was not the fallen star but a lesser-known singer who used the name of the "repentant" star to produce the tape. Despite the tape not being sung by the star, it still filled his pockets. According to insiders, the star's income increased by over 90,000 yuan thanks to this tape. "Imprisonment, who knows if it's not a blessing!" Of course, the recording company earned even more.

Another fallen singer provides a similar example. Before he was released from prison, he was noticed by a certain audio-visual company, which recorded a "September Concert" in prison. Thirty other audio-visual units were not to be outdone, flocking to a certain major city's labor reform bureau to record his tapes. It is said that the recording fee had been raised to 300,000 yuan (see April 13, 1989, *Economic Daily*).

People naturally have a curious nature, and with the neglect of ideological and political work in recent years, the phenomenon of "heroes not smelling good, criminals not smelling bad" has emerged. Not only do they not smell bad, but they even smell sweet for miles. Some people can't help but worship them. If you say the tape is bad, they flock to it; if you say the tape is good, they turn up their noses. Some people's psychology has become so twisted, and the literary and publishing circles have some individuals who, like using six-legged cows, exploit individuals who have committed criminal offenses to cater to this twisted psychology.

To purify people's souls, the literary and publishing circles should prioritize social benefits over economic benefits. I often wonder, should those who sing loudly on the socialist artistic stage or on tapes, in addition to being artists, also be respected as engineers of the human soul in terms of their character?

    双头蛇、六腿牛的巧用
    郭振亚
    物以稀为贵，此话可谓至理名言。倘若黄金多得像太行山上的石头一样，那么，即使它有千千万万种不可由其它物质代替的作用，其价格也非要像庐山瀑布“飞流直下三千尺”似的猛跌不可。动物也一样，倘若一头牛长着六条腿，一条蛇长有两个头，那么，它们的身价会立即百倍，非被某些展出单位
  “请去”，以招徕观众不可。
    好奇之心，人皆有之。然而，奇怪的是这些年来，我们文艺界、出版界的某些人物也学会了这一招儿。不过，他们请来的不是双头蛇，不是六条腿的牛，而是少数曾经失过足，或者犯过其它严重错误而引起舆论大哗的人物，或录音，或拍电影，以期引起轰动效应。
    一盘《悔恨的泪》，我们都不会怀疑那是失过足的某影星的录音。但是，我们受骗了，《悔恨的泪》的演唱者，根本不是某影星，而是一个名气不大的歌唱者借用了这位“悔恨”者的名字，灌出的一盘带子。尽管带子不是出自这位影星的喉咙，但没有影响他的腰包鼓起来。据有关人士透露，就是靠了这盘带子，某影星的收入增加了九万多元。蹲监狱，“安知非福”！当然，录音单位赚得更多。
    另一位失过足的歌星，也是这方面的例子，在他还没有出狱的时候，就被某音像公司所看中，在狱中搞了一次“九月歌会”的录音。其它30家音像单位也不甘示弱，纷纷云集某特大城市劳改局，要录他的带子，据说录制稿酬已抬到30万元（见1989.4.13《经济日报》）。
    人本来就有好奇心，再加上这些年忽略思想政治工作，以致出现了“英雄不香，罪犯不臭”的现象，不仅不臭，还香飘万里哩，有些人恨不得对他顶礼膜拜。你说这录音带子不好，他们反而趋之若鹜；你说这录音带好，他们反而不屑一顾。有些人的心理变得如此畸型，而文艺界、出版界的某些人就像利用六条腿的牛似的，利用犯过刑事罪的人物，去迎合这种畸型心理。
    为了净化人们的心灵，文艺界、出版界应该把社会效益放在经济效益前边去考虑。我总在想，那些在社会主义艺术舞台上或录音带中引亢高歌者除了艺术之外是否在人格上也应该是人们敬重的人类灵魂的工程师呢？
