Nanguang Company and Fuji Bank of Japan Collaborate to Establish Kangfuguo International Leasing Company

	Beijing, December 4 (Xinhua) — Reporter Ji Hongqing reports: The original China Kanghua Development Company and Japan's Fuji Bank jointly established China Kangfuguo International Leasing Company. After the dissolution of Kanghua Company, the Chinese side's equity was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade's directly-affiliated Nanguang Company. Today, the new Chinese partner — Nanguang Company General Manager Cao Wantong and Fuji Bank Executive Director Zhaohu Liangyou signed a cooperation agreement in the Great Hall of the People. The equity transfer agreement was also signed simultaneously.

	Kangfuguo International Leasing Company is the first joint venture established by Fuji Bank in China. The signing of the new cooperation agreement demonstrates China's consistent adherence to its commitments and the protection of the legal rights of foreign partners.
