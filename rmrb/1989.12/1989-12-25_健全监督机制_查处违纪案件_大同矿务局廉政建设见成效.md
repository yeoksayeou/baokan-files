Datong Coal Mine Bureau, the largest coal energy base in China, has established and improved supervision mechanisms, focusing on supervising leaders at the bureau and mine levels. This has effectively promoted anti-corruption efforts.

From 1986 to 1988, the bureau was consecutively awarded the title of "National Advanced Enterprise in Employee Ideological and Political Work" by the Central Propaganda Department, the State Economic Commission, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. This year, they have addressed issues that are most sensitive to the public and have the strongest reactions, such as promotions, recruitment, admissions, housing allocation, wage and bonus distribution, and the employment of contract labor teams. They have formulated and adhered to the open office system for the bureau and mine-level agencies, increasing transparency in their work.

The Datong Coal Mine Bureau has set up 86 hotlines for reporting and 125 mailboxes for complaints, and has appointed over 2,000 party discipline supervisors. This has formed a network where the bureau and mines have supervision groups, party branches have supervision stations, and party cells have supervision posts, ensuring that disciplinary cases are quickly investigated and handled.
