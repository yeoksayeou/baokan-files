A 100-day competition aimed at stabilizing the economy and making contributions has been launched among the million workers and cadres in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, since November, yielding remarkable results. So far, the negative growth trend in the city's economy has been initially curbed, and production has shown signs of recovery.

This year, more than 1,000 enterprises in Harbin have faced unprecedented difficulties in production and operations. To reverse this situation and create a favorable "small climate" for next year's production preparations, the Harbin Municipal Party Committee and Government have adopted the approach of relying on the spirit of ownership to overcome difficulties. The municipal government and its affiliated departments have formed 19 competition coordination and service teams, which have gone to factories and shops to help enterprises solve various production problems.

The Harbin Pencil Factory is short of wood, and Li Yufang, the director of the Municipal Bureau of Materials who led the team to serve the factory, immediately arranged for the company to purchase 700 cubic meters of materials on credit, solving the urgent production needs. Jia Shouyu, the director of the Municipal Price Bureau, led a team to the Third Traditional Chinese Medicine Factory. In just a few days, he helped the enterprise rationalize the prices of eight types of medicines, enabling the factory to increase its revenue by more than 400,000 yuan.

The down-to-earth work style and leading role of leaders at all levels have been highly praised by the broad masses of workers. This competition quickly reached its peak. The Harbin Film Machinery Factory launched the competition for just 20 days, and the factory's output value and realized profits both increased by more than 15% compared to the same period last month.

The Harbin Light Chemical Industry Group, which was originally expected to lose 8.5 million yuan for the year, saw workers encouraging each other during the 100-day competition, actively tapping into internal potential, and is expected to reduce the loss by 100 million yuan by the end of the year.

More than 4,000 party members at the Harbin Bearing Factory proposed to work hard for 8 hours to achieve high production and to volunteer for 8 hours outside of work to make contributions. In just the first half of November, they volunteered 30,000 hours of work. More than 5,600 young workers were not to be outdone, completing 40% more tasks per person in a month, making the factory's production in November increase by 13% compared to the previous month, and reducing product costs by 8%.

    哈市百万职工开展百日竞赛
    全市生产出现回升势头
    据新华社哈尔滨12月10日电　（记者蒋耀波、通讯员陈海萍）一个稳定经济、争作贡献的百日竞赛活动，自11月起在黑龙江省哈尔滨市百万工人和干部中展开，并取得了显著成果。到目前为止，这个市的经济负增长现象已得到了初步遏制，生产出现了回升势头。
    今年以来，哈尔滨市1000多家企业的生产经营遇到了前所未有的困难。为了扭转这一局面，并为明年的生产准备工作创造一个良好的“小气候”，哈尔滨市委市政府确定了靠主人翁精神排险渡关的思路。这个市政府及所属各部门组成19个竞赛协调服务组，进厂下店，帮助企业解决各种生产难题。
    市铅笔公司木材短缺，带队下厂服务的市物资局长李玉芳立刻安排通过赊销为这家公司组织进货700立方米，解决了生产急需。市物价局长焦守裕带队来到中药三厂，短短几天就帮助企业理顺了8种药品价格，使这个厂增收40多万元。
    各级领导干部扎实的工作作风和带头作用深得广大职工的称赞，这场竞赛活动迅速达到高潮。哈尔滨电影机械厂开展竞赛仅20天，就使全厂的产值和实现利润均比上月同期增长15％以上。
    原计划全年亏损850万元的哈尔滨市轻工化学总厂，在百日竞赛活动中，广大职工相互鼓励，积极挖掘内部潜力，预计到年底可减亏100万元。
    哈尔滨轴承厂4000多名党员提出8小时内拚命大干夺高产、8小时外义务劳动作贡献，仅11月上旬就献工3万小时；5600多名青年工人也不示弱，一个月人均超额完成任务的40％，使全厂11月份产量比上月增长13％，产品成本下降8％。
