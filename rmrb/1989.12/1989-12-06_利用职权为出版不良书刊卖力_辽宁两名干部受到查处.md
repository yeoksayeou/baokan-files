Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 4th — According to the Liaoning Provincial Supervision Bureau's Complaint Center, Wang Weiying, deputy manager of the Liaoning Provincial Xinhua Bookstore, abused his authority, embezzled public funds, and provided financial support for his son Wang Gang to publish low-brow publications. He lent out over 200,000 yuan in public funds. Yu Dongfeng, deputy editor-in-chief and head of the comprehensive editing department of the Liaoning Science and Technology Press, met with a black-market book peddler from Changchun, Deng, in April this year. He facilitated the publication of the obscene book "The Science of Life: The Art of Marital Sex" for Deng. Yu Dongfeng abused his authority, deceiving his superiors by claiming it was a "household management manuscript," obtaining an ISBN for it, personally setting the price, and approving the publication of 15,000 copies, collecting a management fee of 5,000 yuan. Later, Deng rushed to print 400,000 copies and distributed them across the country, causing serious consequences. The Liaoning Press and Publication Bureau decided to dismiss Wang Weiying and Yu Dongfeng from their positions.

    利用职权为出版不良书刊卖力
    辽宁两名干部受到查处
    新华社沈阳12月4日电  （记者魏运亨）据辽宁省监察厅举报中心透露，辽宁省新华书店副经理王维英，利用职权，挪用公款，为其儿子王刚发行格调低下的书刊提供资金，先后借出公款20多万元。辽宁省科技出版社副总编兼综合编辑室主任于冬风，今年4月结识了长春市不法个体书贩邓某，为其出版淫秽书刊《生活的科学——夫妻性生活艺术》提供方便。于冬风利用职权，向领导谎称这是“家政管理方面的稿子”，给办了书号，亲自定价，同意出版1.5万册，收管理费5000元。后邓某突击抢印了40万册，发往各地销售，造成严重后果。辽宁新闻出版局决定给予王维英、于冬风撤职处分。
