After a day of rest, the seventh Asian Cup Women's Football Championship resumed tonight with intense matches. In Group A, Chinese Taipei defeated Thailand 5-0, and China defeated North Korea 4-1.

The match between China and North Korea started at 8:10 PM. The Chinese team, unfamiliar with their opponents' strengths, played cautiously. The North Korean players fought tenaciously and aggressively, making it difficult for the Chinese team to organize effective attacks despite controlling the game. The Chinese team had only three shots on goal. At the 20th minute, China's number 6, Li Xiufu, received the ball in midfield and passed it to Wu Weiying on the right. Wu quickly advanced, dribbling past the defender, and shot powerfully from the edge of the penalty area with her left foot. The North Korean goalkeeper anticipated the direction of the ball but failed to catch it, allowing the ball to slip into the net. China led 1-0. Shortly after, North Korea equalized when number 6, Shu Jie, scored from a powerful shot from the left side of the penalty area. Subsequently, China's number 14, Zhang Yan, and Wu Weiying scored in the 35th and 37th minutes respectively, ending the first half with a 3-1 lead.

In the second half, the North Korean team, exhausted from the first half, struggled to maintain their formation. In the 26th minute of the second half, China's number 10, Liu Ailing, scored from a header in front of the opponent's goal, lifting the ball over the goalkeeper and into the net.

Earlier, Chinese Taipei defeated Thailand 5-0. Chinese Taipei's number 6, veteran Zhou Taiying, scored three goals.

    亚洲杯赛海峡两岸女足齐报捷
    中国队胜朝鲜队  中国台北队胜泰国队
    本报香港12月21日电　第七届亚洲杯女子足球锦标赛经过一天休战后，今晚重燃战火。A组两场角逐的结果是，中国台北队5∶0战胜泰国队。中国队4∶1击败朝鲜队。
    中朝之役是在晚上8时10分开始进行的。中国队由于不明对方虚实，交战后踢得比较谨慎。加上朝鲜姑娘打得顽强积极，逼抢较凶，使中国队一时未能组织起有效的进攻，虽然控制了场上主动权，但只有3次射门。比赛至第20分钟时，中国队6号李秀馥中场得球后斜传给右路的吴伟英，吴迅即往前推进，晃过对方后卫，在禁区边上左脚劲射。朝鲜队守门员已判断到球的方向，但却脱手入网，中国队以1∶0领先。未几，朝鲜队在右侧开出角球后，6号舒在姬在禁区左边劲射破网，扳成1平。此后，中国队14号张岩和吴伟英分别在第35分钟和第37分钟先后建功，以3∶1结束上半场。
    易地再战，朝鲜队由于体力消耗较大，章法较乱。下半时第26分钟时，中国队10号刘爱玲在对方小禁区前接队友传中球，抢在对方守门员出击时将球轻挑进入空门。
    在此之前进行的另一场比赛，中国台北队以5∶0战胜泰国队。中国台北队6号老将周台英独进3球。　（吴沛彝）
