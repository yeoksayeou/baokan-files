Title: Why Are Prices of Famous Paintings Soaring

Wealthy individuals in Western countries have shown a keen interest in the works of famous artists in the past few years, spending tens of millions of dollars to acquire a single oil painting. Consequently, the prices in the international art market have surged.

In May of this year, a self-portrait by the Spanish master Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) sold for $47.85 million, causing a sensation. On November 15, another of his works, "The Smart Boy," was sold at Sotheby's in New York for $40.7 million, also making headlines. On November 30, Picasso's work from his 24th year, "The Wedding of Pierrette," was auctioned simultaneously in Paris and Tokyo via satellite, and was purchased by the Japanese Otani Corporation for 3.15 billion francs. Including a 5% transaction fee, the total cost was $51.4 million.

Although Picasso's paintings have reached such astonishing prices, they have not broken the world record. That honor goes to the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," painted a year before his death (1889), which was sold by Sotheby's in 1987 for $53.9 million (the transaction price was $49 million, with the buyer additionally paying 10% of the sale amount as commission to the auction house). The buyer of this famous painting was the Australian billionaire Alan Bond. Bond is not a passionate art lover or collector; he simply had too much idle money and saw an investment opportunity. The story of Mr. Bond and the painter van Gogh can be considered an anecdote:

In early 1987, Mr. Bond, who knew little about art, suddenly had an impulse and asked his friends, "Are van Gogh's works worth buying?" The response was affirmative. He then instructed his subordinates in London and New York to keep an eye out for any van Gogh works up for sale. Soon, Christie's in London auctioned van Gogh's "Sunflowers," and he bid over the phone, but ultimately lost to a Japanese tycoon who paid $39.9 million. A few months later, another van Gogh work, "The Pont de Trinités," appeared at an auction, but he missed out again due to a low bid, and it was sold for $20.2 million. In November, he decided to acquire a van Gogh work at any cost. Fortunately, van Gogh's "Irises" was up for sale at Sotheby's in New York. After a fierce bidding war, Mr. Bond bid $49 million over the phone, and the room fell silent. He became the ultimate winner.

After obtaining this "best painting in the world" (because it is the "most expensive painting"), Mr. Bond treated it as a strange treasure, insuring it and taking strict anti-theft measures, and rarely allowing it to be displayed. He awaits the day when this painting will bring him fortune. Speaking of van Gogh's "Irises" and fortune, the story is quite dramatic. Van Gogh died at the age of 37 and sold only one painting in his lifetime. "Irises" naturally did not find a buyer. After his death, this painting was passed among several French collectors until 1937, when it was purchased by an American museum. Ten years later, it was acquired by Mrs. Petsen of the United States for $80,000 (equivalent to $420,000 today). Forty years later (1987), the Petsen family consigned the painting to Sotheby's for sale, and thus it came into the hands of Mr. Bond. In 40 years, its price had increased by more than 128 times.

After famous paintings became investment targets for capitalists, their prices soared to unimaginable levels. This abnormal commercial phenomenon has caused museums and art galleries in various countries to lose their ability to compete in acquiring works by famous artists, thus depriving the general public of the opportunity to appreciate superior artworks. Masterpieces by artists are treasures of human culture and should be made available for people to appreciate and learn from. However, they are now priced so high that they are confined within the market. An article in the November 27 issue of U.S. Newsweek by Robert Hughes states that raising the value of artworks with money appears to respect human cultural achievements, but in reality, the beneficiaries are the sellers and merchants, while the victims are museums and the general public. This "plundering" behavior, relying on wealth, is equivalent to printing only one copy of a literary work or other masterpiece and hiding it away from the world. This not only causes many human cultural achievements to lose their intended purpose and value but is also a mockery and brutal destruction of culture.

    名画价格为何飞涨
    陈封
    西方国家的阔佬近两三年对于名画家的作品大感兴趣，为获得一幅油画，一掷数千万美元无吝色，于是国际艺术品市场上的行情猛涨。
    今年5月，西班牙大画家毕加索（1881—1973）的一幅自画像售得4785万美元，曾轰动一时；11月15日他的另一幅作品《伶俐的小伙子》在纽约苏斯比拍卖行以4070万美元被人购去，也成为令人咋舌的新闻。11月30日，毕加索24岁时的作品《皮埃莱特的婚礼》在由卫星电视联结的巴黎、东京两地拍卖，被日本的奥特波利斯公司以3.15亿法郎买走。加上5％的交易费，这笔买卖高达5140万美元。
    毕加索的画虽然卖到如此惊人的高价，但并未打破世界纪录。冠军属于由苏斯比拍卖行在1987年售出的荷兰画家梵高逝世前1年（1889）所作的那幅《蓝鸢尾花》，售价高达5390万美元（成交价4900万美元，按规定买主另付拍卖行货款十分之一的佣金）。这幅名画的买主是澳大利亚超级资本家阿兰·邦德。邦德并不是一位狂热的油画爱好者或收藏家，只不过是闲钱太多，看中了一个投资目标而已。关于邦德先生和画家梵高的“姻缘”似乎可以算是一段轶事：
    1987年初某日，对艺术一知半解的邦德先生忽然心血来潮，询问他的朋友们，“梵高的作品值不值得买一张？”得到的回答是肯定的。于是他通知他派驻伦敦和纽约的下属留意出售梵高作品的信息。不久伦敦克里斯蒂拍卖行拍卖梵高的《向日葵》，他通过长途电话出价，最后却被一位日本巨商以3990万美元买去。数月后另一幅梵高作品《特灵奎泰尔桥》又出现在拍卖行里，可惜他再误于出价偏低而被别人以2020万美元夺走。11月时，他下决心不惜任何代价要得到一幅梵高作品，正巧梵高的《蓝鸢尾花》在纽约的苏斯比拍卖行待价而沽。经过一番激烈的抬价竞争，邦德先生通过电话喊出4900万美元，全场立即哑然，他成为最后的赢家。
    邦德先生得到这幅“世界上最好的画”（因为是“最贵的画”）之后，把它当作奇异的珍宝，既保了险，又采取了严密的防盗措施，不肯轻易让它露面。他等待将来这幅画给他带来财运。说起梵高这幅《蓝鸢尾花》和财运的关系也颇富戏剧性。梵高在37岁时便死了，生前只卖过一幅画，《蓝鸢尾花》当然没有找到买主。这幅画在他死后被一些法国收藏家转手多次，直到1937年才由美国一个美术馆买去，10年后又由美国的培森夫人以8万美元（相当于目前的42万美元）购得。40年以后（1987）培森家族把画委托苏斯比拍卖行出售，于是此画到了邦德先生手中。经过40年，其价格增长了128倍多。
    名画成为资本家的投资目标以后，价格涨到不可思议的程度。这种畸形的商品经济现象使各国博物馆和美术馆丧失了收购名家作品的竞争力，于是平民大众也就失去了欣赏高超艺术品的机会。艺术大师的作品都是人类文化的瑰宝，理应尽可能让人民观赏借鉴，但现在却被挂上沉重的高价标签禁闭在市场圈内。11月27日出版的美国《时代》周刊一篇文章作者罗伯特·休斯说，以金钱抬高艺术品的价值，看起来似乎是尊重人类文化结晶，实际上得利的是卖主和商人，受害者是博物馆和广大人民。这种倚仗财势的“掠夺行为”等于文学或其他名著只印一本并被秘藏，与世隔绝。这不但使许多人类文化成就失去了它们应有的作用和价值，也是对文化的讽刺和粗暴的破坏。
