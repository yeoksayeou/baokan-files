Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 20th.

    Agricultural development in the southern Hunan region has shown promising results. This year, the region, which is one of the eight national key agricultural development areas, has taken significant steps forward. The agricultural development has increased grain production by 210 million kilograms. Additionally, 424,500 mu of land has been reclaimed for planting fruits, flue-cured tobacco, and other economic crops, adding 51.468 million yuan in income from economic crops.

    The southern Hunan agricultural development area includes the cities of Chengzhou, Lingling, and Hengyang, encompassing a total of 31 counties and cities. The region is rich in land resources. The provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have decided to develop the agriculture in southern Hunan, aiming to create the second-largest commercial grain base in the province, second only to the Dongting Lake area. The plan is to increase grain production by 900 million kilograms, oil crops by 50,000 tons, meat by 130,000 tons, and aquatic products by 10,000 tons by 1992. In July, the State Council formally approved this plan.
