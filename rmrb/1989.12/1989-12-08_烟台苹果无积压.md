Yantai Apples Have No Surplus

	The People's Daily reports: Yantai City in Shandong Province has focused on improving apple quality and lowering prices to expand apple sales. This year, 450 million kilograms of apples were harvested, and by the end of November, 410 million kilograms had been sold. The remaining apples are being gradually transported to other regions.

	Yantai apples are renowned nationwide. This year, despite a slight increase in apple production compared to last year, Yantai City drew lessons from past surpluses. It focused on improving quality, selling at a slight profit to increase sales volume, and expanding the market. This ensured that this year's fruit production, despite high output and a sluggish market, did not result in any surplus.

    烟台苹果无积压
    本报讯　山东省烟台市以提高苹果质量，降低价格为重点，努力扩大苹果销售。今年下树的4.5亿公斤苹果，到11月底，已销出4.1亿多公斤，余下部分也正陆续调运外地。
    烟台苹果在国内享有声誉。今年，烟台市在苹果产量较上年略有增加的情况下，吸取过去积压的教训，在提高质量、薄利多销、扩大销售市场三方面作了大量工作，使今年果品生产在产量高、市场销售疲软的情况下，没有发生积压现象。　　　　（王学宗）
