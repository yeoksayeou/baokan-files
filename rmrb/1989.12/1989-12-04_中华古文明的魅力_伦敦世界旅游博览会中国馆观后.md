The 10th London World Tourism Expo came to a close today at the famous Olympia Exhibition Centre in London. Since Princess Anne of Britain presided over the opening ceremony on the 28th, the venue has been bustling with visitors. The grand, multi-layered exhibition hall is filled with vibrant and eye-catching displays from various countries, each showcasing their unique attractions. The distinctive Chinese pavilion, which has been on display since June, is the first of its kind at such a large-scale international tourism expo and has garnered significant attention from all quarters.

The annual London World Tourism Expo was inaugurated in 1980. Over the past decade, the number of participating units and visitors has rapidly increased, and the scale and content of the exhibitions have undergone significant changes. It has gradually become a major event for the international tourism industry to showcase new developments and facilitate exchanges, as well as a platform for trading tourism products. Last year's expo alone saw transactions worth 2.8 billion pounds.

This year's expo saw participation from over 2,500 tourism industry units from 135 countries and regions across five continents. The exhibition hall was a spectacle of diverse attractions, each country vying to outdo the others, reflecting the intense competition within the global tourism industry.

The "China Pavilion," located on the first floor of the exhibition hall, stood out with its unique and grand design, exuding a strong sense of national character. At the front of the pavilion stood a life-sized, imposing Terracotta Warrior from the Qin Dynasty, meticulously crafted and lifelike. To its left, a large glass display case showcased a replica of the bronze chariot and horses unearthed from the Qin Tomb, complete with four bronze horses and a bronze charioteer. The chariot and horses were adorned with exquisite decorations and intricate craftsmanship, creating a magnificent sight that captivated visitors, some of whom took photos to commemorate the moment. The pavilion was adorned with archways featuring colorful paintings, intricate layouts reminiscent of southern Chinese gardens, and the iconic "Flying Horse Treading on a Swallow" tourism emblem, making it a captivating sight.

Following last year's successful participation, China once again made a strong impression at this year's expo with a fresh new look. Led by the National Tourism Administration, exhibition booths from nine provinces and cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, each showcased their unique attractions. Among them, the "Silk Road" and "Three Gorges of the Yangtze River" tourism routes stood out, drawing considerable interest from visitors.

The Yellow River and Yangtze River have been the cradles of Chinese civilization for thousands of years. The "Silk Road," extending westward from the upper reaches of the Yellow River, is a world-renowned ancient trade route connecting China to the West. Its unique historical sites, artifacts, landscapes, and cultural heritage have captivated historians and travelers from both China and abroad for generations, symbolizing China's historical openness to the world. The "Three Gorges of the Yangtze River" are akin to a gallery of natural wonders, filled with famous landmarks and countless enchanting stories. Poets and scholars have long been inspired by its beauty. In recent days, visitors have been flocking to the exhibition, with an average of over 4,000 people per day. Several British disabled individuals even made a special trip in their wheelchairs, pushed by family members. Journalists from Britain, Italy, and Nordic countries have been visiting to report on the Chinese exhibition. The British Broadcasting Corporation covered the Chinese pavilion and requested video materials on the "Silk Road" for a special feature. Over the past few days, more than 100 travel agencies have held business discussions with various Chinese exhibitors. An editor from an Italian publishing house, Miss Maria Zali, exclaimed in front of the Chinese pavilion, "What a lively scene! I didn't expect China to have such an impressive pavilion this year." A British friend also remarked to the reporter, "China, with its thousands of years of history and culture, undoubtedly holds a strong appeal for Western tourists."

China's rich history, vast territory, diverse ethnic groups, numerous historical sites, and beautiful landscapes provide an excellent foundation for the development of its tourism industry on the global stage. Since China implemented its open-door policy, the number of foreign tourists visiting China last year reached 1.84 million, an eightfold increase from 1978. However, to become a major player in the global tourism industry, China still needs to make significant efforts. Mr. Rickrish, former head of the British Tourism Authority and current vice-chairman of the European Tourism Commission, praised the Chinese pavilion, saying, "Very good, very good!" As a long-time friend of the Chinese people who has visited China multiple times, he also sincerely hopes that China's tourism industry will "strengthen its public relations work" and encourage Chinese friends to vigorously expand the tourism market.

    中华古文明的魅力
    ——伦敦世界旅游博览会中国馆观后
    本报记者　陈特安
    第十届伦敦世界旅游博览会，今天在伦敦闻名的奥林匹亚展览中心落下帷幕。自英国皇家安妮公主28日主持博览会开幕式4天来，观众云集，热闹非凡。宏伟宽广的多层展览大厅内，五彩缤纷、争奇制胜的各式展台，鳞次栉比，令人目不暇接。富有特色的中国展台，是今年6月以后第一次展现在这种特大规模的世界旅游博览会上，受到了各方人士的重视与瞩目。
    每年一度的伦敦世界旅游博览会创始于1980年。10年来，参展单位和参观人数迅速增加，展出规模与内容也有重大变化。它已逐步成为国际旅游业新发展的大检阅、大交流的盛会，同时也是旅游产品的交易会。仅去年的伦敦博览会上，成交额就达28亿英镑。
    来自五大洲135个国家和地区的2500多个旅游行业单位参加了本届博览会。整座展览大厅异彩纷呈，各施其技、各扬其长，成了世界旅游业剧烈竞争的一个缩影。
    座落一层展览大厅的“中国馆”别具一格、富丽堂皇，有浓郁的民族特色。展馆正面屹立着同真人一样高大而威武的秦陶俑，造型逼真、栩栩如生。在其左侧的大玻璃橱窗内陈列着秦陵出土的铜车马复制品，有四匹铜马和一个铜驭手。车体、铜马装饰华丽、工艺精巧，十分壮观，令人流连忘返，有的观众还在此拍照留念。展馆四周既有拱形牌坊式的彩画，又有江南园林的精巧布置和天马踏飞燕的旅游标徽，真是引人入胜。
    中国继去年成功地参加了博览会之后，今年又以新的面貌在博览会上崭露头角。由国家旅游局带头，北京、上海等九个省市的展台各具特色，其中尤以“丝绸之路”和“长江三峡”两条旅游线路更具魅力，引起观众的浓厚兴趣。
    黄河、长江同是中华民族几千年古文明的摇蓝。从黄河上游向西延伸的“丝绸之路”更是驰名世界的中国通西域的历史古道。这里独特的历史古迹、文物、地貌、风情，古往今来都令中外历史学家、旅行家们的神往，并且可以说是中国对外开放的一个历史性的象征。“长江三峡”两岸犹如画廊、仙境，名胜古迹林立，流传着无数奇妙动人的故事。自古以来有多少诗人墨客为之倾倒、讴歌。连日来观众则源源不断，每天平均都在4000人以上。有几位英国残疾人还特地坐在轮椅上，让其家人推着前来参观。英国、意大利以及北欧国家的记者纷纷前来采访，英国广播公司对中国展台作了报道，并要求得到“丝绸之路”录相资料，准备再作专题报道。这几天，有一百多家旅游公司与中国各参展单位洽谈业务。意大利的一家出版社编辑玛丽扎莉小姐面对中国展台，不禁赞叹道：“好热闹啊！想不到中国今年能有这么出色的展台。”一位英国朋友也对记者说：中国具有数千年悠久的历史文化，“中华古文明无疑对西方游客具有魅力”。
    历史悠久、疆域辽阔、民族众多、古迹林立、风景优美为中国旅游业走向世界提供了极为有利的条件。尤其是中国实行对外开放以来，去年到中国旅游的外国游客已达184万，是1978年的8倍。但是要跻身世界旅游大国行列还需要作出巨大的努力。英国旅游局前局长、现任欧洲旅游委员会副主席里克瑞什先生在参观中国展台时连声称赞“很好，很好！”但作为多次访华的中国人民的老朋友，他也衷心希望中国旅游业“要加强公共关系工作”，鼓励中国朋友锐意拓展旅游市场。（本报伦敦12月1日电）
