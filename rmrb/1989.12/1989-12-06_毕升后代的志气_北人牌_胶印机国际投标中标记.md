The Spirit of Bi Sheng's Descendants – "Beijing People's" Printing Press Wins International Bid

On the morning of December 5, the conference hall of the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation was filled with representatives from UNESCO, the World Bank, and relevant departments from China, all enthusiastically congratulating the Beijing People's Machinery Factory on their successful bid.

Amidst the congratulations, the tall and sturdy General Manager of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, Zhu Tanlin, with sweat from his hard work and a satisfied smile, received the bid-winning notice for the "Beijing People's" printing press from the international bidding company. Deputy General Manager Yao Guangcheng, along with representatives from relevant departments, signed over a hundred bid-winning contracts one by one.

A Resounding Success

The success of the "Beijing People's" printing press bid has shaken up the domestic and international printing machine industry.

A year ago, UNESCO and China's State Education Commission jointly proposed the "China Textbook Development Project," aiming to standardize the printing of Chinese higher education and general education textbooks according to international norms starting from 1991. This involves changing from the current 32-page format and general lead typesetting to a 16-page format and multicolor offset printing. Developing this project was included in the World Bank's 1989 fiscal plan, allocating over $30 million to bid for 6 types and 148 offset printing machines worldwide. The result was that the Beijing People's Machinery Factory won the bid for 5 types and 113 machines, with a bid-winning foreign exchange amount of nearly $20 million.

This achievement has made domestic competitors envious, and even those who have long been known as the "world's printing king" or boast of producing world-famous brands have had to take a fresh look at China's Beijing People's Machinery Factory.

Strategic Planners Prevail

In the early spring of this year, at the bid evaluation sites such as the trial printing plant of Tsinghua University in Beijing, when the "Beijing People's" four-color offset printing machine and four-fold five-color offset printing machine were running at a speed of 10,000 prints per hour, international bid evaluation officials carefully inspected and tested the prints.

Oh, the color registration error of various colors was not more than 0.01 millimeters, the characters were clear, and the colors were correct. This quality can compete with the same type of products from "Heidelberg," and the price is reasonable.

The success of the "Beijing People's" bid was not accidental. They had a long-term vision and went through a arduous but fruitful product development process.

In 1956, when Marshal Zhu De inspected the expanding Beijing People's Machinery Factory, he proposed that the factory's products should serve the printing industry in China and the world. Since the reform and opening up, a batch of marketable products have been introduced, with the variety increasing from 10 to 25, and the quality maintaining three out of the four gold and silver medals awarded by the state in the printing machine industry, including the only gold medal. There are also four products that have won the "Ministry Excellence" and "Municipal Excellence" awards. The products have also been sold to the international market. In the past five years, they have been welcomed in 20 countries in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia, with an annual foreign exchange earnings of over $100 million.

Before 1983, the factory's leadership analyzed that the reform of textbook printing in the country was inevitable, and they set their sights on occupying this market. After thorough preparations in terms of talent, technology, and equipment, they invested over 20 million yuan to develop various offset printing machines for textbooks. Four-color offset printing machines, four-fold five-color offset printing machines... all were developed. Subsequently, over a hundred quality problems were solved, and 18 sets of precision machining and testing equipment were purchased from Switzerland, Japan, and other countries to realize modern precision machining and quality testing methods.

Last September, they learned about the international bid for offset printing machines and were very pleased. The entire factory was prepared for a fierce competition, determined to fight for national glory.

Victory in Sight

An unusual competition has ended, and the "Beijing People's" brand has defeated world-famous brands, taking the lead in the international bid.

Printing technology was invented by our ancestors, but due to various reasons, modern Chinese printing industry has fallen behind. The Beijing People's Machinery Factory's bid success shows that China's printing industry is rising in the world's leading ranks, fully demonstrating China's printing machine manufacturing strength. This is also a significant step in blocking blind imports and revitalizing the national industry.

The Beijing People's Machinery Factory, with its spirit, is truly a descendant of Bi Sheng. The reporter saw in the factory's export workshop and assembly workshop that a new and exquisite printing machine had been assembled, and workers were carefully adjusting them. Some were already packed and ready to be shipped.

National Labor Model and recipient of the "Bi Sheng Award" in the national printing system, General Manager Zhu Tanlin, happily said that by the end of the year, 24 machines can be delivered on time and with quality assurance. He also told the reporter that the company's days are relatively good for this year, next year, and the year after. This year's planned output value is 130 million yuan, sales revenue is 150 million yuan, and profits and taxes are 46.82 million yuan. These planned indicators are all about 5% higher than last year, and now it seems that they can be completed with confidence.

    毕升后代的志气
    ——“北人牌”胶印机国际投标中标记
    本报记者　张书政
    12月5日上午，中国机械设备进出口总公司会议大厅里，联合国教科文组织、世界银行的代表和我国有关部门的同志，热烈地祝贺北京人民机器总厂中标成功。
    在祝贺声中，身材魁梧的北京人机总厂厂长朱谈林，带着疲劳的汗水和欣慰的笑容，接过国际招标公司下达的“北人牌”胶印机中标通知书；该厂副厂长姚广成会同有关方面代表，在百余份中标合同书上一一签字。
    这一炮打得响
    “北人牌”胶印机中标，震动了国内外印刷机行业。
    一年前，联合国教科文组织和我国国家教委联合提出“中国教科书发展项目”，拟于1991年后，中国高教、普教教材实行国际规范化印刷，即由现行的32开本、一般铅字改为16开本、套色胶印。开发这一项目，被世界银行列入1989年度的财政计划，拨出3000多万美元，在全世界范围内招标6个品种148台胶印机。结果，北京人机总厂一举中标5个品种113台，中标创汇额近2000万美元。
    此举使国内同行羡慕不已，就连一向号称“世界印刷之王”或以生产世界名牌自居的一些厂家，都对中国的北京人机总厂刮目相看了。
    深谋远虑者胜
    今年初春，在北京清华大学教材试印厂等投标考评场所，当“北人牌”四色胶印机和四开五色胶印机以每小时喷吐1万张印样的速度飞转时，国际招标考评官员们审慎地抽查检测着一张张印样。
    噢，各种颜色的套色印刷误差不超过0.01毫米，字清色正，这质量可以和“海德堡”的同类产品媲美，而且价格合理。
    “北人牌”中标不是偶然的。他们深谋远虑，经历了艰苦而有成效的产品开发历程。
    1956年，朱德委员长来到扩建中的北京人机总厂视察时提出，该厂产品方向要为中国和世界印刷事业服务。改革开放以来，一批适销对路的产品问世，品种由10个发展到25个，质量上保持着国家在印刷机行业中颁发的4块金、银奖牌中的3块，而且独占了唯一的金牌，还有4个品种获“部优”和“市优”。产品也打到国际市场上去了。5年来，在美洲、欧洲、非洲和东南亚的20个国家受到欢迎，年创汇额在百万美元以上。
    1983年前，该厂领导分析认为，全国的教材印刷改革势在必行，要立壮志占领这块市场。经过人才、技术、设备等方面的认真准备，他们投资2000多万元，开拓出一种种、一台台能够套色胶印教科书的印机产品。四色胶印机、四开五色胶印机……都开拓出来了。紧接着百余项质量难题都被攻克，又从瑞士、日本等国购进精加工和检测设备18台、套，实现了精加工和质量检测手段现代化。
    去年9月，他们获悉胶印机国际招标的信息，十分高兴，全厂上下厉兵秣马，决心拚搏一场，为国争光。
    乘胜前进
    一场不寻常的角逐结束了，“北人牌”力挫世界名牌，在国际招标中独占鳌头。
    印刷术是我国祖先率先发明的，但由于种种原因，近代中国的印刷业落后了。北京人机总厂此次中标，说明中国印刷业正在世界先进行列中崛起，充分显示了我国印刷机制造的实力。这也是为挡住盲目进口，振兴民族工业迈出的可喜的一步。
    有志气的北京人机总厂，不愧为毕升的后代。记者在该厂出口车间和装配一车间看到，一台台崭新精美的印刷机已装配完毕，工人们正在悉心调试，有的已打包待运。
    全国劳动模范、全国印刷系统“毕升奖”获得者朱谈林厂长高兴地说，到年底，可以保质保量地交货24台。他还告诉记者，企业今年、明年和后年的日子都比较好过。今年计划产值1.3亿元，销售额1.5亿元，利税4682万元，这些计划指标都比去年增长5％左右，现在看来，都有把握完成。
