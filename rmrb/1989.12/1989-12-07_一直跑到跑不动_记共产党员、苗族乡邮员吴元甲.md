On the rugged mountain roads of Wangsi District in Guizhou's Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, people often see a man. He carries two large green mailbags filled with newspapers and letters, climbing green mountains and crossing green waters, tirelessly running.

He is Wu Yuanjia, a Communist Party member and Miao ethnic minority rural postman. Wu Yuanjia, after demobilization from the army, came to Wangsi District Post Office in 1965 and became a mailman.

The mail route that Wu Yuanjia runs is extremely harsh. Within a radius of less than 10 kilometers, the altitude rises from 500 meters to over 1,500 meters, with mountains upon mountains. It is a place where people say, "You can hear each other shouting over the mountains, but it takes half a day to walk." More than ten villages are scattered on the mountain slopes and hilltops. To deliver newspapers and letters to every village, Wu Yuanjia climbs up the mountain and then down, and then climbs up again. The locals call the Yellow Gold Mountain, which is so steep that when climbing up, your knees touch your nose, a place where "even if you have breath, you won't have much." Wu Yuanjia has to cross this mountain twice every shift. Over 24 years, he has crossed this mountain more than 5,300 times. Standing at the foot of Yellow Gold Mountain, Wangsi District Party Secretary Luo Zhiqing pointed to the winding path on the cliff and sighed to the reporter, "These places originally had no roads. It was Wu Yuanjia who, over the years, stepped out this path one step at a time."

On this arduous mail route, Wu Yuanjia has shed sweat and even faced the threat of death. Once, after delivering mail in Yanghe Township, he braved the heavy rain and descended from the cliff to the riverbank. As dusk approached, while he was wading through the river, a sudden flash flood struck. The raging torrent, mixed with tree branches and rocks, swept him down, tumbling him more than 30 meters. In desperation, he grabbed a large tree beside him, narrowly escaping death. When he staggered back home, his wife and daughter saw the deep cuts all over his body and cried in pain.

The two townships of Yanghe and Jichang, which Wu Yuanjia is responsible for delivering mail to, are the poorest and most remote mountainous areas in Wangsi District, with almost all residents being members of the Water and Miao ethnic minorities. To help the people understand current events and gain knowledge, he reads the newspaper and explains party policies at every delivery point during his rest time, promoting wealth-creation paths, economic, and technological information introduced in the newspaper. After hearing Wu Yuanjia's newspaper readings, the locals learned about the benefits of developing commodity economies and actively sought wealth-creation paths. Previously, there was no habit of growing vegetables here, but in recent years, several varieties have been grown. This year, just the early-maturing tomatoes alone have brought in more than 2,000 yuan of additional income for over 100 households. Now, every village and every village group in these two townships have subscribed to newspapers and periodicals. People, based on the information provided in the newspapers, have introduced hybrid seeds, started using plastic film coverage, and two-stage seedling raising... Scientific farming has taken root in the mountainous areas where ethnic minorities reside.

"The living post office." This is how local officials and the masses praise him. In his work, Wu Yuanjia has always been serious and responsible, always considering the convenience of the people. Last year, a household in Jichang Township corresponded with relatives in Spain. To ensure nothing goes wrong, Wu Yuanjia treated ordinary letters as registered mail, each time detouring more than ten li to deliver them to the family. Someone asked him: "Isn't this too hard on you?" He said, "Walking a few more steps is nothing. Such letters are related to China's postal reputation and the position in the hearts of overseas compatriots." In Jichang and Yanghe Townships, almost every household with relatives working outside has asked Wu Yuanjia to pick up their remittances and parcels for them. Wu Yuanjia always delivers them on time, without ever making a mistake.

Wengqi Primary School is Wu Yuanjia's farthest delivery point. From Jichang Township, it takes 25 li to walk, and you have to cross a big mountain in between. This primary school only subscribes to one copy of the "Guizhou Daily." To let the teachers read the newspaper, he has been running for 18 years. The school really couldn't bear it and repeatedly told Old Wu not to subscribe anymore. Wu Yuanjia said, "How can teachers not read the newspaper? I'll pay for it myself, but I have to deliver it to you."

Over 24 years, Wu Yuanjia has walked a total of more than 200,000 kilometers on foot, delivering 100,000 newspapers and letters without any errors. This year, he was awarded the title of National Labor Model and attended the National Labor Model Commendation Conference with honor.

Many people who care about him ask: You are already 53 years old, don't you want to find the bureau leaders to change to a lighter job? Wu Yuanjia always says, "I have never thought about changing to a lighter job. I am a Communist Party member. As long as the organization asks me to do it for as long as I can, I am willing to run as a rural postman until I can't run anymore."

    “一直跑到跑不动”
    ——记共产党员、苗族乡邮员吴元甲
    本报记者  胡跃平
    在贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州王司区的崎岖山路上，人们时常能看到一个汉子，肩挎两只装满报刊、信函的绿色大邮包，爬青山，涉绿水，不停地奔走着。
    他，就是共产党员、苗族乡邮员吴元甲。吴元甲从部队复员后，1965年来到王司区邮电支局当上了邮递员。
    吴元甲跑的这条邮路，条件极端恶劣，在不到10公里的直径范围内，海拔高度从500米陡然上升到1500多米，处处层峦叠嶂，是一个人称“隔山喊得应，走路要半天”的地方。十几个村寨东一处西一处，散落在山腰间、坡顶上，为了把报刊信函送到每一个村寨，吴元甲上了山顶又下来，下来后又爬上。被当地人称为“爬上黄金坡，有气也不多”的黄金山，崎岖得上坝时膝盖抵着鼻尖，吴元甲每个班都要翻越两次，24年来，他翻越这座高山达5300多次。来到黄金山脚，王司区委书记娄芝兴指着山岩上那弯弯的小道感慨地对记者说：“这些地方原来没有路，是吴元甲常年来一步一步踩出来的。”
    在这条艰辛的邮路上，吴元甲洒满了汗水，甚至遭受过死神的威胁。一次，他在阳河乡投递完后，冒着大雨从山崖上下到河边，时近黄昏，在他趟河时，山洪突然暴发。湍急的洪流夹杂着树枝、山石倾泻而下，将他冲倒在洪水中翻滚了30多米，危急中，他猛地抱住身边一棵大树，才幸免于难。当他跌跌跄跄走回家时，妻子、女儿见他全身一道道血痕，心痛地落下泪来。
    吴元甲负责投递的阳河、基场两乡，是王司区最贫穷、最偏远的山区，居住的几乎全是水族和苗族。为了让群众了解时事、增加知识，他每到一个投递点，就利用休息时间给群众读报，讲解党的政策，宣传报上介绍的致富门路、经济和科技信息。当地群众听了吴元甲的读报宣传后，知道了发展商品经济的好处，纷纷找致富门路。过去，这里没有种蔬菜的习惯，这几年也种了好几个品种，今年，光早熟西红柿一项，就有100多户人家每户增收2000多元。如今，这两个乡的每个村、每个村民组都订有报刊，人们根据报刊提供的信息，引进了杂交良种，搞起了地膜覆盖，两段育秧……科学种田开始在少数民族聚居的山乡里扎了根。
    “元甲是我们的活邮局”。当地的干部群众这样称赞他。在工作上，吴元甲始终认真负责，处处方便群众。去年，基场乡有一户人家与在西班牙的亲属通了信。为做到万无一失，吴元甲把普通信件当挂号信一样，每次都绕道十几里送到这家人手中。有人问他：你这样做不是多吃苦吗？他说：“多走点路算个啥，这种信件可是关系到中国的邮电信誉和在海外同胞心目中的地位呀”。在基场、阳河两乡，凡是有亲属在外地工作的人家，几乎都请吴元甲代取他们的汇款、包裹，吴元甲每次都及时送到他们手中，从未出过一次差错。
    翁奇小学是吴元甲最远的一个投递点，从基场乡出发，得走25里路，中间还要翻一座大山。这个小学只订了一份《贵州日报》，为让老师们读到报纸，他一跑就是18年。学校实在不忍心，多次给老吴说不订了。吴元甲说：“老师不看报怎么行？我自己掏钱订，也要给你们送。”
    24年来，吴元甲徒步累计达20多万公里，投递报刊、信函100多万件无差错。今年被评为全国劳动模范，光荣出席了全国劳模表彰大会。
    不少关心他的人问：你已是53岁的人了，难道不想找局领导换点轻松的工作干？吴元甲总是这样说：“换轻松的工作我没想过。我是共产党员，组织上叫我干多久我就干多久，我愿跑乡邮一直跑到跑不动。”
