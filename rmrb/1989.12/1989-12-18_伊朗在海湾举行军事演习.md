Iran's navy and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps concluded a week-long joint military exercise in the Gulf and the Sea of Oman on the 16th. According to a broadcast by the Tehran Radio, this was the largest-scale military exercise held by Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The primary objective was to enhance coordination between the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard in times of war. Iran deployed over ten thousand personnel and dozens of destroyers, missile boats, troop transports, hovercraft, jet fighters, mine-sweeping helicopters, and Revolutionary Guard vessels for this combined electronic warfare and amphibious landing exercise.
