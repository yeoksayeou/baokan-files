Today, December 11, marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations' Declaration on Social Progress and Development. The declaration, produced 20 years ago, expressed the universal aspirations of the international community, particularly the developing countries, for peace and development. It proposed goals for social development in all countries and continues to have practical guiding significance for the social progress of all countries, especially the developing ones.

In the late 1960s, a large number of newly independent developing countries urgently sought to consolidate their national independence, develop their national economies, and strive for social progress and development. The United Nations Social Development Commission, after nearly 20 years of understanding the situation and policy planning in the international community, also felt the need for an international agreement and convention in the field of social development. It was against this backdrop that the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2215 in 1966, deciding that the Social Development Commission would draft a declaration on social development. The draft declaration underwent several reviews and revisions by relevant United Nations bodies, and the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the Declaration on Social Progress and Development on December 11, 1969.

The Declaration on Social Progress and Development is the most comprehensive programmatic document to date in the field of social development by the United Nations. It correctly pointed out the interdependent and mutually influential relationship between social progress and economic development with an international environment of peace. It believed that an unjust international economic order, colonial plunder, racial discrimination, wars, and arms races hindered social progress and development. The Declaration called for changing unreasonable international economic relations, improving the international trade status of developing countries, and for developed countries to provide necessary aid to developing countries to promote economic development and social progress in the world. The Declaration also proposed that the purpose of social progress and development is to continuously improve the material and spiritual living standards of all members of society, maintaining a harmonious balance between material progress in science and technology and moral progress in spirit and culture. It called for accelerating industrialization while paying attention to solving potential negative social consequences. The Declaration actively advocated for a series of legislative, administrative, and economic measures to guarantee people's basic rights to survival, especially to care for the living welfare of special groups such as the mentally and physically disabled in society. Over the past 20 years, the development of the world situation has shown that the series of proposals in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development have played a positive role in promoting world peace and social progress and development.

As a formal member of the United Nations Social Development Commission, China actively responded to the call of the Declaration on Social Progress and Development. Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the past 10 years, the Chinese government has done a great deal of work in ensuring employment, increasing people's income, providing social welfare, and labor protection, and has achieved positive results.

The Chinese government attaches great importance to employment work, implementing a policy that combines employment introduction by labor departments, voluntary employment organizations, and self-employment. In recent years, under the principle of "training before employment," various vocational schools and training centers have developed rapidly. From 1978 to 1987, a total of 75.88 million people were employed in urban areas nationwide, and the urban unemployment rate dropped from 5.3% in 1978 to 2% in 1987. Women are playing an increasingly important role in China's socialist construction. By the end of 1987, the number of female workers in the country had reached 48.69 million, accounting for 37% of the total number of workers. Through methods such as organizing social welfare factories by urban civil affairs departments or setting up collective ownership welfare production networks by districts, streets, and units for concentrated placement, and dispersed placement in various enterprises, the Chinese government encourages and helps the disabled to engage in labor within their capabilities. Now, more than 50% of the disabled in China who have the ability to work or partial ability to work are already employed.

On the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity, the Chinese government has planned to raise the wage level of workers and gradually improve the living standards of the people. Compared with 1978, the national average real wage of workers in 1987 increased by 51.9%. At the same time, the state has continuously created safe and healthy working conditions and a good working environment for workers from the aspects of legislation, policies, and technical measures to ensure safe production. Since 1978, China has successively promulgated a series of comprehensive labor protection regulations and national standards for labor safety and hygiene. The state also allocates special funds every year to control dust and toxic hazards.

The Declaration calls for providing social security and welfare for "those who cannot make a living due to illness, disability, or old age." The Chinese government has been doing this for a long time. Chinese citizens have the right to receive material assistance from the state and society when they are old, sick, or lose the ability to work. Since the founding of the nation, China has vigorously developed social insurance, relief, and medical and health services, especially in the protection of female workers and minors, a great deal of work has been done. In July 1988, the State Council promulgated the "Regulations on Labor Protection for Female Workers" to protect the labor rights of female workers. In November 1988, the Ministry of Labor and other departments issued a notice again, strictly prohibiting any unit or individual from using child labor.

China, which accounts for one-fifth of the world's population, has formulated social development plans according to its own national conditions and the achievements it has made in the cause of social progress. It has made its own contribution to the implementation of the Declaration on Social Progress and Development and the promotion of world peace and development.

    为了世界和平与发展
    ——纪念联合国《社会进步和发展宣言》通过二十周年
    温宪
    今年12月11日是联合国《社会进步和发展宣言》通过20周年。20年前产生的这一宣言表达了国际社会特别是发展中国家谋求和平与发展的普遍愿望，提出了世界各国社会发展的努力目标，对世界各国特别是发展中国家的社会进步至今仍有现实指导意义。
    60年代后期，刚刚取得独立的一大批发展中国家迫切要求巩固自己的民族独立，发展民族经济，谋求社会进步与发展。而联合国社会发展委员会经过近20年对国际社会状况及其政策规划方面的了解，也深切感到在社会发展领域需要有一个国际协议和公约。正是在这样的背景下，1966年联合国大会通过2215号决议，决定由社会发展委员会起草社会发展宣言。宣言草案几经联合国有关机构的审议和修改，联合国大会于1969年12月11日正式通过《社会进步和发展宣言》。
    《社会进步和发展宣言》是联合国在社会发展领域迄今为止最全面的一份纲领性文件。它正确地指出了社会进步和经济发展同国际和平环境之间相互依赖和影响的关系，认为不公正的国际经济秩序、殖民主义掠夺、种族歧视、战争、军备竞赛等阻碍了社会的进步和发展。《宣言》要求改变不合理的国际经济关系，改善发展中国家的国际贸易地位，发达国家应向发展中国家提供必要的援助，以利于整个世界的经济发展和社会进步。《宣言》还提出，社会进步与发展的宗旨是不断提高社会全体成员的物质与精神生活水平，在科技等物质进步和精神、文化等道德进步之间保持和谐的平衡发展，呼吁在加速工业化的同时要注意解决由此可能产生的不良社会后果。《宣言》积极主张采取一系列立法、行政和经济措施，保障人们生存的基本权利，特别要照顾到社会中精神和身体伤残者等特殊群体的生活福利。20年来世界局势发展表明，《社会进步和发展宣言》中提出的一系列主张在推动世界和平和社会进步与发展方面起到了积极的作用。
    作为联合国社会发展委员会的正式成员，中国积极响应《社会进步和发展宣言》的号召。建国40年来，特别是最近10年来，中国政府在保障就业、增加人民收入、提供社会福利和劳动保护等方面做了大量工作，并取得了积极的成果。
    中国政府十分重视劳动就业工作，实行劳动部门介绍就业、自愿组织就业和自谋职业相结合的就业政策。近年来，在“先培训后就业”的原则指导下，各类技工、职业学校和训练中心发展很快。从1978年到1987年10年间，全国城镇累计安置了7588万人就业，城镇待业率从1978年的5.3％下降到1987年的2％。妇女在中国社会主义建设中发挥着越来越大的作用。到1987年底，全国女职工人数已达到4869万人，占职工总数的37％。通过由城镇民政部门举办社会福利工厂或区街、单位开办集体所有制的福利生产网点进行集中安置和在各类企业分散安置的办法，我国政府鼓励和帮助残疾人从事力所能及的劳动。现在，我国有劳动能力或有部分劳动能力的残疾人已经就业的超过了50％。
    在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，我国政府有计划地提高了职工工资水平，逐步改善了群众生活。与1978年相比，1987年全国职工的实际平均工资增长了51.9％。与此同时，国家从立法、政策和技术措施等方面不断为劳动者创造安全卫生的劳动条件和良好的工作环境以保证安全生产。1978年以来，我国先后颁布了一系列劳动保护综合法规和劳动安全卫生国家标准。国家还每年拨出专款用于尘毒危害的治理。
    《宣言》要求为“因疾病、残疾或年老而不能谋生的人提供社会保障和福利事业”，中国政府早就这样做了。中国公民在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的情况下，有从国家和社会获得物质帮助的权利。建国以来，我国大力发展社会保险、救济和医疗卫生事业，特别是在女职工和未成年人的保护问题上，做了大量工作。1988年7月，国务院颁布了《女职工劳动保护规定》，保护女工劳动权益。1988年11月，劳动部等部门再次发出通知，严禁任何单位和个人使用童工。
    占世界人口1／5的中国根据自己的国情制定社会发展规划及其在社会进步事业上所取得的成果，为《社会进步和发展宣言》的实施和促进整个世界的和平与发展，做出了自己的贡献。
