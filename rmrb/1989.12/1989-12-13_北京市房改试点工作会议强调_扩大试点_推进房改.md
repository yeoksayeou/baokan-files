    "Some people have asked whether housing reform should still be carried out now?" At the Beijing Municipal Housing Reform Pilot Work Conference held today, Mayor Chen Xitong's response was affirmative: "We must resolutely carry it forward."

    According to the leadership of the Municipal Housing Reform Office, Beijing's housing reform is being conducted in four forms: First, units sell new and old houses to employees at a discount; second, organize housing cooperatives to build houses; third, in conjunction with the renovation of dilapidated houses, organize cooperatives; fourth, sell houses to society at market prices. Over the past year, despite some twists and turns, progress has been made. For example, the Xinxing Residential Cooperative in Daxing County has had 208 households join since its establishment, collecting 31.4 million yuan in individual housing funds, which is 2.2 times the 14 million yuan invested by the Daxing County government in the past three years.

    Chen Xitong said that the direction of housing reform is completely correct. This not only speeds up the resolution of housing difficulties but also promotes the formation of a healthy economic cycle. He demanded that the current 11 pilot units be expanded to over 100, with each district and county having several. District and county party secretaries and mayors should take the lead, striving to achieve results in the first half of next year and launch another wave of housing reform in the second half.

    To promote housing reform, Beijing Municipality decided to establish a Housing Reform Office as a municipal government agency, and to establish corresponding institutions in each district and county to strengthen the development of this work.

    北京市房改试点工作会议强调
    扩大试点　推进房改
    本报北京12月12日讯　记者颜世贵报道：“有人提出现在房改还搞不搞？”在北京市今天召开的房改试点工作会议上，市长陈希同的回答是肯定的，“要坚定不移地搞下去。”
    据市房改办的领导介绍，北京市的房改是以四种形式进行试点的：第一种是单位向职工优惠出售新旧房，第二种是组织住宅合作社建房，第三种是结合危旧房改建组织合作社，第四种是以市场价向社会公开出售。试点一年来虽有曲折，但都在前进。如大兴县新兴住宅合作社自成立迄今已有208户居民入社，收回个人建房资金314万元，为近三年大兴县政府建房投资140万元的2.2倍。
    陈希同说，房改的方向是完全正确的。这不仅加快了解决住房困难的步伐，也促进了经济良性循环的形成。他要求将现有的11个试点单位扩大到100多个，各区、县都要有几个。区、县长和区、县委书记挂帅，力争明年上半年抓出成效，下半年再掀起一个房改高潮。
    北京市为了搞好房改工作，决定成立房改办公室作为市府的一个单位，同时在各区、县也成立相应的机构，以加强这项工作的开展。
