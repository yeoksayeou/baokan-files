On August 27, 1947, Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping led the main force of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army to break through the heavy encirclement and pursuit by the Kuomintang's powerful forces, successfully completing the mission of marching thousands of miles into the Dabie Mountains. This bold strategic breakthrough dealt a heavy blow to the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary strategic plan and wrote a brilliant page in the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary war.

Victory did not come easily, and consolidating and developing the victory was fraught with difficulties. To break the enemy's "extermination" of the Dabie Mountains and establish a solid Central Plains liberated area, Commander Liu Bocheng led us, the 1st Column, to cross the Huai River unexpectedly in mid-December and enter the Huaixi region. In early January 1948, the main force of the 1st Column was ordered to move to the area north of Xiangcheng to operate, while the 20th Brigade, where I was stationed, advanced south to the border area of Henan and Anhui, specifically to Baoxin Village and Zhao Village, to assist the local party committee in establishing the government and mobilizing the masses. On January 11, the main force of the brigade was operating west of Baoxin Village when it encountered the enemy's so-called "Five Major Forces," the 11th Army. The enemy's repeated attacks were repelled. However, due to the enemy's superior numbers, our forces withdrew from the battle after dark. During the withdrawal, the rear guard of the 59th Regiment encountered a detachment of the enemy. The regiment was complacent and mistakenly thought it was our own troops. The enemy opened fire first, causing heavy casualties to the regiment.

At that time, Commander Liu Bocheng was stationed with the rear headquarters of the field army in the area south of Xinchai and Huazhuang, only tens of kilometers away from our brigade. After the defeat at Baoxin Village, the main force of the brigade regrouped near Zhao Village for rest. We conducted a thorough review of the brigade's recent combat operations and other aspects of work. As the brigade commander, I took full responsibility for the problems that had occurred. We summarized our findings in a written report and submitted it to Commander Liu Bocheng. Considering that the commander might want to know more about the situation of the troops or have instructions for us, on January 31, we decided to send the communications officer, Li Guozhu, to personally deliver the report.

Li Guozhu returned to the brigade headquarters at dusk on the same day. He proudly handed me a heavy envelope with "To Comrades Wu Zhong and Liu Zhenghuo, Personal" written on the outside in calligraphy, and then enthusiastically recounted his meeting with Commander Liu Bocheng.

Before Li Guozhu could finish speaking, I eagerly opened the letter and, under the dim light, read it together with Comrade Liu Zhenghuo. The letter was obviously drafted by the staff and revised by Commander Liu Bocheng; the margins and spaces between the lines were filled with Commander Liu Bocheng's personal handwriting. To my surprise, the reply did not specifically comment on our report but instead discussed many important views on fundamental issues related to the construction of the army and strategy and tactics.

Below is the full text of Commander Liu Bocheng's letter:

"The enemy's strategic defensive focus (main aspect) is in the Dabie Mountains, while other areas are secondary. In these two segments, the key is the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and Wuhan.

Currently, the Kuomintang with the support of the United States is not as strong as the Kuomintang with the support of Japan. First, the strength of the world (democratic forces) and our forces has increased significantly.

The heavy defense of the Dabie Mountains is the same old tactic used by Okamura Yasuji in North China, such as large-scale sweeps, area-by-area extermination, special assault teams, roads, railways, and strongholds. The railways and the Huai River are the supply bases for the 'sweeps,' and the Xinyang-Huangchuan Road and the major arteries of Xinyang are exposed to us.

If we can make the enemy's defensive focus suffer continuous small-scale annihilation and starvation, gradually leading to large-scale annihilation, and coordinate with neighboring forces for large-scale annihilation, then in three to five months, the counterattack situation will have new developments.

The 'Three Inspections' (inspecting class, thought, and work style) to promote the party's work in thought, organization, and discipline, and to clarify the boundaries between the enemy and us, is necessary to remove obstacles for the two major tasks of annihilating the enemy and land reform. It is hoped that the situation will be estimated patiently and step by step, and that the fundamental problem will be solved by starting with thought.

Fighting spirit and tactics are the keys to military operations. Without a fighting spirit, not only will everything be in vain, but there is also a risk of annihilation. Tactics are built on the foundation of fighting spirit. An army without fighting spirit is self-declaring its death sentence. The Kuomintang's training teams in Lushan and Nanjing now are precisely to address the issues of fighting spirit and tactics. At the same time, the enemy and we are mutually complementary in strength, with one gaining while the other loses. If both sides gain, the stronger will ultimately prevail, and the weaker will ultimately decline; if both sides decline, the passive side will surely be defeated.

The 11th Army in the night battle of Baoxin Village was afraid of us, but we failed to take advantage of their fear to launch a fierce attack. This can be used as a lesson!

The layout of land reform should be able to expand in all directions like a back-to-back formation, as the power of a surface formation is greater and more effective.

Our tactics have been explained. Our fighting spirit must be strengthened. Remember, the Kuomintang's defeat is inevitable, and our confidence in victory is based on science. It all depends on our efforts!

The 58th Army is moving north between Huangchuan and Gushi; the 10th Army is in Qushan; the 75th Army's reinforcement battalion with two companies is in Fuyang; the security team is in Zhengyang; the 11th Army's 18th Brigade is north of Shangcheng in Shangshiqiao; the other two brigades have been unknown since they passed through Xuanhuazhuang and Xufu on the 22nd."

The letter also included two short appendices. The first was "A Study of Our Army's Encirclement and Annihilation Tactics":

"The enemy concentrates its forces to encircle and annihilate our main forces, while its second-line rear forces are scattered and weak, with the policy of stationing one company or one platoon in one place. In the first step, our army should use one or two brigades to annihilate the enemy's one company; in the second step, force the enemy's one regiment not to station or harass. Only after reaching this step can we be mobile and flexible, or concentrate information to fight a larger annihilation battle. To do this, we must: 1. Coordinate with other columns and military districts to obtain accurate information about the enemy's distribution and fortifications (intelligence). 2. Avoid the enemy's main forces at the right time. Being too early or too late is not beneficial (it is difficult to keep secrets in new areas). 3. Attack targets that are far from the enemy (main forces). 4. After determining the target, launch a swift attack. 5. Attack any enemy without allowing the enemy to notice. 6. After success, quickly handle the wounded and move the troops to another place to rest, and prepare to attack the second target."

The second was "Enemy (Kuomintang) Tactics":

"Search for 'bandits' with specially selected and trained elite forces and special assault training. Their tactics are: 1. Divide and conquer the 'bandits' by area, with plainclothes scouts and night raids. 2. Gradually expand upon arrival at a place, making it impossible for 'bandits' to hide and operate. 3. Organize competitions among regiments, battalions, and companies, with rewards for merit. 4. Pay special attention to night actions and the return of the Home Defense Corps.

(This is the enemy's tactic of dividing and encircling, night raids, and Okamura Yasuji's special assault team)."

Everyone discussed the letter enthusiastically, believing that Commander Liu Bocheng's instructions were highly targeted, in line with the actual situation of the troops, and far-sighted, not just addressing specific issues, but focusing on fundamental problems. The instructions were concise and profound, full of philosophical insights.

Time flies, and the past is like smoke. However, the letter that Commander Liu Bocheng wrote to us still lingers in my mind.

    回忆刘帅的一封重要信件
    吴忠
    1947年8月27日，刘伯承、邓小平率晋冀鲁豫野战军主力，粉碎了蒋介石集团强大兵力的围追堵截，胜利完成了千里挺进大别山区的任务。这一大胆的战略突破行动，沉重打击了蒋介石的反革命战略计划，在中国人民革命战争史上写下了光彩夺目的一页。
    胜利来之不易，而要巩固和发展胜利，更是困难重重。为打破敌人对大别山区的“围剿”，建立巩固的中原解放区，刘伯承司令员于12月中旬率我们1纵队，出敌不意，北渡淮河，进入淮西地区。1948年1月初1纵队主力奉命开往项城以北地区活动，我所在的20旅则南进至豫皖边的包信集、赵集一带，配合地方党委建立政权，发动群众。1月11日，旅主力于包信集以西活动时，与号称“五大主力”之一的敌整编第11师遭遇。敌人的各次进攻都被击退。由于敌人兵力过大，夜黑之后我军撤出战斗。转移中，59团后卫营与一股开进的敌军相遇。该营麻痹大意，误以为是自己部队。敌军先我开火，使该营遭到重大伤亡。
    当时，刘司令员率野战军后指驻新蔡东、化庄以南地区，距我旅只有数十公里。包信集战斗失利后，旅主力集结于赵集附近休整。我们对部队前段的作战行动及其他方面的工作进行了认真总结。作为旅长，我对发生的问题主动承担了责任。我们将总结整理成书面报告，呈送刘司令员。考虑到首长可能会要了解部队一些具体情况或对我们有所指示，1月31日我们决定派通信科长李国枢将报告亲自送去。
    李国枢于当日黄昏回到旅部。他神彩飞扬地把一封沉甸甸的外面用毛笔写着“吴忠、刘振国同志亲启”字样的信递给我，便滔滔不绝地讲起他谒见刘司令员的情况。
    我不待李国枢同志讲完，急忙把信拆开，在昏暗的灯光下同刘振国同志一起阅读。信显然是参谋人员起草，刘司令员修改的；信纸的四周和各行空间，则是刘司令员的亲笔。出乎我意料之外的是，回信并未就我们的报告作具体批示，却就当前部队建设和战略、战术方面的一些根本性问题，讲了许多重要看法。
    下面是刘司令员信的全文：
    “敌人战略防御重点（主要方面）在大别山，其他则为次要方面。在这两段之轴心，则为平汉南段与武汉。
    现在国民党加美国，不如当时国民党加日本。首先世界力量（民主力量）与我们力量强大多了，强大多了。
    大别山之重点防御，系冈村宁次在华北那一套老调，如大扫荡、分区清剿、挺身队、公路、铁路、据点等。而铁路、江淮为‘扫荡’之补给基地，信（阳）潢（川）公路及信阳的大血管，即暴露在我们的面前。
    我们如使其重点防御方面，不断受到小的歼灭、饿困，逐渐蔚成大的歼灭，以配合友邻大的歼灭，则三五个月内，反攻战局又将有新的发展。
    三查（查阶级、查思想、查工作作风）而促进思想、组织与纪律三方面整党，划清敌我界限，以清除歼敌、土改两大任务的障碍，实为必要，务望估计情况耐心而有步骤地进行，并且必须从解决思想入手，才能处理好这一根本问题。
    斗志与斗法（战术）是用兵的把柄，要善于贯彻运用之。如无斗志，则不但一切谈不上，而且有覆灭的危险。斗法是建立在斗志之上的东西，军队无斗志，是自己宣布了死刑。蒋贼的庐山训练团及现在南京的训练团，就是要解决斗志与斗法问题。同时，敌我双方互为盈虚、消长，即是此盈彼虚，此长彼消，如两相长，则强者终长，弱者终消；如两相消，则消极者必败。
    敌整编11师在包信集夜战之怕我，惜未乘其怕而痛击之。可作为教训，可作为教训！
    土改布局，要善于背靠背地向各方面扩张成面，成面的力量才大，才易于有所作为。
    我们的斗法（战术）已告，我们的斗志必须强化。须知蒋贼败局已定，我们的胜利信心是有科学根据的，唯在我们努力而已！
    敌58师在潢川、固始间之春河集，似向北进；10师，确山；75师补充团两个营，阜阳；保安团正阳；11师18旅在商城以北之上石桥；其他两旅自宣化店、经扶后（22日）即不知其行踪。”
    信后还有两个简短附件。其一是《我军合击战法的研究》“敌集结合击我主力，其后方第二线兵力分散、薄弱，当以一个营一个连驻守一地之方针。我第一步以一个旅、两个旅分别歼灭敌一个营；第二步再迫使敌人一个团不敢驻守或出扰。达到这一步，我们才能机动自如，或集中信息，打较大歼灭战。如此必须：一、各纵队和各军分区联系，取得敌人分布及工事等准确情况（情报）。二、适时避开敌之主力。过早过迟都不利（在新区保密很难）。三、攻击目标以远离敌人（主力）者为好。四、确定目标后，以急行军猛袭之。五、攻击任何敌人，不可使敌人注意。六、得手之后，迅速处理伤员，部队转移他地休息，并再准备攻击第二个目标。”
    其二是《匪（蒋）军战法》“搜索‘匪军’以特选精干，加以特殊训练与突击训练。其战术：一、以分路分区剿之，便衣远探，夜出奔袭。二、每到一地逐渐扩张，使‘匪’无法隐藏活动。三、各团营连组织竞赛，论功给奖。四、特别注意夜间动作和收容还乡团。
    （此系敌之分进合击、夜行晓袭加冈村宁次之挺身队战法）。”
    大家就信展开了热烈讨论，都认为刘司令员的指示既有很强的针对性，符合部队现实情况，又高瞻远瞩，不就事论事，抓了带根本性的问题；指示言简意赅，又富哲理性。
    时光流逝，往事如烟。但是，刘司令员写给我们的这一封信，却时时萦绕脑际。
