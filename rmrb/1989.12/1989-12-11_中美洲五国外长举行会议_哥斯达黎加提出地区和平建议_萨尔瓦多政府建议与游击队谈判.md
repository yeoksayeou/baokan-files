Central American Five Countries' Foreign Ministers Hold Meeting
Costa Rica Proposes Regional Peace Initiative
Salvadoran Government Suggests Negotiations with Guerrillas

	BEIJING, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of five Central American countries held a meeting today in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, to set the agenda for a special summit of the five countries' leaders. Costa Rica proposed a regional peace initiative. Meanwhile, the Salvadoran government today suggested ceasefire talks with the guerrillas.

	The foreign ministers of the five Central American countries had heated discussions during today's meeting. The focus was on the issue of the severance of diplomatic relations between El Salvador and Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan foreign minister accused the Salvadoran government of human rights violations; the foreign ministers of El Salvador and Honduras, in turn, accused Nicaragua of aiding the guerrillas, thereby violating the regional peace agreement. The Costa Rican government stated that it would present a regional peace initiative to the summit, which includes calling for an immediate ceasefire in El Salvador during the Christmas and New Year period (December 12 to January 15); unconditional dialogue between the government and the guerrillas to end the conflict through negotiations; and suggesting that the United Nations Observer Group in Central America supervise the ceasefire in El Salvador and begin verification work on the borders of El Salvador-Honduras and Honduras-Nicaragua.

	Meanwhile, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani today stated that the government is willing to resume negotiations with the guerrillas in Caracas on December 20; the condition is that the guerrillas cease hostile actions before the talks begin.

    中美洲五国外长举行会议
    哥斯达黎加提出地区和平建议
    萨尔瓦多政府建议与游击队谈判
    本报墨西哥城12月9日电  记者郭伟成报道：中美洲5国外长今天在哥斯达黎加首都举行会议，为5国首脑特别会议制订议程。哥斯达黎加提出地区和平建议。与此同时，萨尔瓦多政府今天建议与游击队停火谈判。
    中美洲5国外长在今天的会议上进行了激烈的争论。焦点是萨尔瓦多与尼加拉瓜断交问题。尼加拉瓜外长指责萨尔瓦多政府侵犯人权；萨尔瓦多、洪都拉斯外长则指责尼加拉瓜援助游击队，违反地区和平协议。哥斯达黎加政府表示将向首脑会议提出一项地区和平建议，包括要求萨尔瓦多双方立即在圣诞节新年期间（12月12日到1月15日）停火；政府与游击队双方无条件进行对话，通过谈判结束冲突；建议联合国驻中美洲观察团监督萨尔瓦多停火，并开始在萨尔瓦多—洪都拉斯、洪都拉斯—尼加拉瓜边境进行核查工作。
    与此同时，萨尔瓦多总统克里斯蒂亚尼今天表示，政府方面愿意与游击队本月20日在加拉加斯重新进行谈判；条件是游击队在谈判开始前停止敌对行动。
