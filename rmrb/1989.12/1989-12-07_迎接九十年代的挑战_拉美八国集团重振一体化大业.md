	Facing the Challenges of the 1990s
	— The Rio Group Revitalizes the Cause of Integration
	By Li Zhiming, People's Daily Correspondent

	"Either keep pace with the times or forever lag behind the clock of history. Either create history or watch another opportunity slip by." This was the warning issued by Argentine President Carlos Menem at the third summit of the Rio Group in October this year. The world is about to step over the threshold of the 1990s, and the 21st century is already in sight. The global political and economic landscape is undergoing tremendous changes. The 430 million people of Latin America face great challenges. A sense of historical urgency prompts the leaders of Latin American countries to call out loudly: the 1980s were a decade of backwardness for Latin America, the 1990s are the last chance before entering the 21st century, and the way out lies in accelerating integration.

	Generally speaking, Latin America is a region where the Third World developed relatively early, with economic strength and per capita income higher than the average in Asia and Africa. In the 1970s, the per capita GDP grew by 40%. However, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse in the 1980s, with per capita income in 1988 being 7% lower than in 1980. The reasons for Latin America's backwardness are multifaceted. Within the region, several major countries implemented flawed macroeconomic policies, relying on low-interest foreign loans to support high-speed growth. The sharp rise in international interest rates and the plummeting prices of primary commodities (which account for 80% of Latin America's exports) created a double blow, pushing these countries into a deep abyss. While some countries and regions along the Pacific Rim in Asia focused on developing strategies for exporting manufactured goods, most Latin American countries remained content with the domestic market, with exports mainly consisting of traditional products, thus having poor adaptability to international economic changes. Currently, the global economic landscape is undergoing tremendous changes. In 1992, the twelve countries of Western Europe will form a unified market; the economic integration between the United States and Canada is deepening; a new economic center is rising in Asia with Japan at its core; the changes in Eastern Europe will make Western European countries more concerned about this region, etc. Some Latin Americans believe that the United States, Western Europe, and Japan will pay more attention to the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European countries in the 1990s while neglecting Latin America. In this way, Latin American countries will feel that they are being excluded from the mainstream of global economic development. Faced with this situation, the leaders of Latin American countries deeply fear that the economy of this region will experience an even greater decline in the 1990s.

	The history of Latin American countries is similar, and most of their residents speak the same language. More than a hundred years ago, enlightened individuals in Latin America proposed the idea of integration. Over the years, integration has always been a banner raised by politicians in this region. In the 1960s and 1970s, Latin America established several integration organizations and institutions, making some progress in developing intra-regional trade. However, after the debt crisis erupted, each country strove to expand exports and reduce imports, competing to export to countries and regions with strong payment capabilities, and the existing tariff preferences within the region were offset by non-tariff barriers. In 1988, intra-regional imports and exports accounted for only 15.5% and 10.6% of the total imports and exports, respectively, and integration was in a state of semi-stagnation. Although each Latin American country has its own difficulties, from an overall perspective, this is a region with great development potential. To the north, there is Mexico and Venezuela's oil; to the south, there is Argentina and Uruguay's grain and meat; Chile and Bolivia have abundant mineral resources; Brazil has strong industrial power. If the countries of Latin America unite, complement each other, and develop together, the prospects are immeasurable. The Rio Group includes the major countries of Latin America, accounting for more than 70% of the total population. If these countries work together to promote integration, the ideal of several generations of Latin Americans can be realized.

	Recently, the foreign ministers, economic ministers, and planning ministers of the Rio Group gathered in Buenos Aires to discuss specific steps for integration and achieved important results. Unlike in the past, this meeting set some specific short-term goals, first of all, to prepare for the expansion of intra-regional trade to cope with the impact that the unified market of Western Europe will bring in the early 1990s.

	1992 is the year when Western Europe will achieve a unified market, and it is also the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first arrival in the Americas. Five hundred years ago, this historic event created conditions for the great development of European capitalism and was also the starting point for Latin America's appearance on the world political map. Five hundred years later, the Latin American region is once again at a historical turning point, with opportunities and challenges coexisting. The determination of the Rio Group to revitalize the cause of integration brings hope to people. (Reported from Buenos Aires on December 5)

    迎接九十年代的挑战
    ——拉美八国集团重振一体化大业
    本报记者  李志明
    “要么与时间同步前进，要么永远落后于历史的时钟。要么创造历史，要么眼睁睁错过又一次机会。”阿根廷总统梅内姆在今年十月拉美八国集团第三次首脑会上这样向拉美人民发出忠告。世界即将跨过九十年代门槛，二十一世纪已经在望。全球政治经济格局正在发生巨大变化，四点三亿拉丁美洲人民面临极大挑战。一种历史紧迫感促使拉美国家元首大声疾呼：八十年代是拉美落伍的年代，九十年代是进入二十一世纪以前最后的机会，出路在于加速实现一体化。
    总体来讲，拉丁美洲是第三世界发展较早的地区，经济实力、人均收入都优于亚非地区平均水平。七十年代人均国民生产总值增长百分之四十。八十年代形势急转直下，一九八八年人均收入竟比一九八○年水平低百分之七。拉美落伍的原因是多方面的。从本地区来讲，几个主要国家宏观经济政策失当，靠举借低息外债来支持高速增长。国际利率猛升，初级产品（占拉美出口的百分之八十）价格暴跌，两下夹击使这些国家跌入深谷。当亚洲太平洋沿岸一些国家和地区着力发展制成品出口战略时，多数拉美国家仍满足于面向国内市场，出口以传统产品为主，因此对国际经济形势的应变能力很差。当前世界经济格局发生着巨大变化，一九九二年西欧十二国将组成统一大市场；美国加拿大经济一体化程度加深；以日本为中心的新的经济重心在亚洲崛起；东欧发生的变化会使西欧国家更关心这个地区等。一些拉美人士认为，美国、西欧、日本在九十年代将更重视苏联、中国和东欧国家而忽视拉美。这样拉美国家就会产生一种被排斥在世界经济发展主流之外的感觉。面对这种形势，拉美国家领导人深恐九十年代这个地区经济会出现更大滑坡。
    拉美国家历史相同，大部分居民语言相通。一百多年前，拉美有识之士就提出了一体化的主张。多年来，一体化一直是这一地区政治家们高举的一面旗帜。六七十年代，拉美成立了多个一体化组织和机构，在发展地区内贸易方面取得一些进展。但是在债务危机爆发后，各国都竭力扩大出口，压缩进口，争相向支付能力强的国家和地区出口，地区内已有的关税优惠政策被非关税壁垒抵消。一九八八年，拉美本地区内的进出口额分别只占进出口总额的百分之十五点五和百分之十点六，一体化处于半停滞状态。拉美各国虽然各有各的困难，然而从整体看，这是一个发展潜力很大的地区。北有墨西哥、委内瑞拉的石油，南有阿根廷、乌拉圭的粮食、肉类，智利、玻利维亚矿藏丰富，巴西工业实力强大。如果拉美各国联合起来，互相补充，发展前景不可估量。八国集团包括了拉美主要国家，占总人口百分之七十以上，这些国家协力推动一体化，这个拉美几代人的理想就有实现的可能。
    最近，八国集团的外交、经济、计划部长聚集布宜诺斯艾利斯，讨论一体化的具体步骤，取得了重要成果。与过去不同的是，这次会议确定了一些近期的具体目标，首先为对付九十年代初西欧统一大市场将带来的冲击，做好扩大地区内贸易的准备。
    一九九二年是西欧实现统一大市场的一年，又是哥伦布首次抵达美洲大陆五百周年。五百年前的这一历史性事件为欧洲资本主义大发展创造了条件，也是拉丁美洲出现在世界政治版图上的起点。五百年后的今天，拉美地区又一次处在历史转折点上，机会和困难共存，八国集团重振一体化事业的决心给人们带来希望。（本报布宜诺斯艾利斯十二月五日电）
