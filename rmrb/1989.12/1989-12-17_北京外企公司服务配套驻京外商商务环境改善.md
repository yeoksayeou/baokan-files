The Beijing Foreign Enterprise Service Corporation, adhering to the principles of doing practical work and providing comprehensive services, has in recent years continuously expanded its business scope, thereby improving the business environment for foreign enterprises stationed in Beijing.

Currently, there are over 1,100 foreign business, financial, and commercial institutions with permanent offices in Beijing. These institutions require various services from relevant Chinese departments, and these needs are increasing. By the end of October this year, the company had signed employment contracts with 679 foreign enterprises stationed in Beijing, dispatching a total of 3,060 employees. After training, the quality of the dispatched employees has generally improved, with 72 individuals now holding high-level positions such as chief representative, representative, and deputy representative in foreign enterprises stationed in Beijing. Since June, with the increase in the number of foreign enterprises stationed in Beijing and the development of their businesses, the company has, in response to the demands of foreign enterprises, dispatched an additional 517 Chinese employees.
