The two-day U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta has concluded, with Bush and Gorbachev reporting the results of their talks to their respective allies on December 4. Judging from the signs, this summit is an important step in the current adjustment of relations between the two countries, and it is also a move that affects the adjustment of East-West relations. Although the summit did not reach any substantive agreements or issue a joint statement, the content of the U.S.-Soviet talks was broad, with both sides seeking to find common ground in their respective interests and push U.S.-Soviet relations into a "new era."

The Malta summit was held at a time of significant changes in the international situation. Both sides seem to have made some progress on issues related to bilateral relations, but on current European issues, they have largely limited themselves to principled statements. This summit was billed as an informal, high-level meeting for free exchange of views, but both sides prepared carefully. On the first day of the talks, the U.S. leader, departing from past practices, took the initiative to propose a series of measures to improve bilateral relations. These proposals mainly involved two aspects: first, to promote the process of arms control talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, aiming to reach agreements in the fields of nuclear disarmament, conventional disarmament, chemical weapons, and nuclear testing by next year; second, to improve U.S.-Soviet trade and economic relations, and to express support for Soviet economic exchanges with the West. This undoubtedly meets the wishes of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in order to facilitate domestic economic reforms, seeks to create a favorable external environment, an important aspect of which is to reduce military spending and improve relations with the United States. Therefore, the Soviet leader responded positively to many of the U.S. proposals. Bush's shift in attitude on arms control and trade is obviously not without reason. Analysts here believe that one reason is to improve his diplomatic image and take the initiative internationally. A deeper reason is that the current U.S. administration, after consideration and observation, believes that supporting Soviet reforms and improving U.S.-Soviet relations is in the interests of the United States itself.

However, local opinion points out that the new adjustments made in U.S.-Soviet relations are currently mostly limited to verbal intentions, lacking substantive content, and the disagreements within these proposals have not decreased. Regarding nuclear disarmament, both sides agreed to sign a treaty next year, which is a significant change for the Bush administration. However, during the talks, the two sides did not announce new positions on the existing disagreements but left the disagreements to be resolved by their foreign ministers. Therefore, the U.S. proposals will require considerable effort to gradually take effect.

The situation in Europe is a major issue facing this U.S.-Soviet summit and an important topic of their talks. However, both sides have adopted a relatively cautious attitude towards this issue and have revealed little to the outside world. From public statements, it is mostly the expression of principled views by each side, and it seems that no complete decision has been formed. Both sides have stated that they do not want to sketch or determine the future of Europe, while at the same time claiming that U.S.-Soviet cooperation and their respective ways can contribute to the elimination of Europe's division and the end of military confrontation in Europe. Regarding the situation in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union reiterated that it would not intervene, while the United States stated that it had no intention of seeking unilateral gains. Regarding the relations between the two Germanys, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have tried to avoid discussing "German reunification." The Soviet Union's position is to welcome closer economic and cultural exchanges between the two Germanys, advocating the recognition of the reality of the existence of two Germanys and the maintenance of existing borders; the United States' recent four-point principled statement reaffirms the need to proceed from the interests of European stability, taking peaceful and gradual steps, and recognizing the borders of European countries. On the issue of the two military blocs and European disarmament, the two countries, for different reasons, have not emphasized or publicly proposed further disarmament. The United States continues to emphasize the necessity of the existence of NATO, while the Soviet Union no longer emphasizes its original proposal to dissolve the two military blocs, but advocates gradually transforming them from military blocs into political structures. Therefore, from the summit, the U.S. and the Soviet Union continue to advocate gradual progress while maintaining European stability, leaving the search for solutions to the future.

This U.S.-Soviet summit will have an important impact on the development of U.S.-Soviet relations and East-West relations. Local opinion generally responds positively to this, but a comprehensive evaluation of the summit is difficult to achieve a unified view at this time.

    美苏调整关系的重要步骤
    本报记者　张启昕
    为期两天的美苏首脑马耳他会晤已告结束，布什和戈尔巴乔夫4日分别向各自盟国的领导人作了会谈情况的通报。从迹象来看，这次会晤是目前美苏调整两国关系的重要步骤，同时也是牵动调整东西方关系的一步。会晤虽然没有达成具有实质内容的协议或发表联合声明，但美苏会谈的内容广泛，双方力求寻找彼此利益相关的共同点，把美苏关系推向一个“新时期”。
    马耳他会晤是在当前国际局势发生重大变化的时刻举行的。双方在两国关系的问题上似乎取得了一些进展，但对欧洲当前问题则更多地限于原则性的表态。这次会晤名为一次非正式的、自由交换意见的高级会晤，但双方都作了精心的准备。第一天会谈一开始，美国领导人一改往常的做法，采取了主动姿态，提出了一系列改进两国关系的建议。这些建议主要涉及两个方面：一是推动美苏的军备控制谈判进程，力求在明年就核裁军、常规裁军、化学武器和核试验几个领域达成协议；二是改善美苏贸易、经济关系，并表示在苏联同西方的经济交往中给予支持。这无疑符合苏联的愿望。苏联为了国内的经济改革需要，力求创造一个有利的外部环境，其中重要的方面就是削减军备、改善对美关系，因此苏联领导人在不少方面对美国的建议作出了积极响应。布什在裁军、经贸方面的态度发生这种转折显然事出有因。此间分析家认为，原因之一是改善其外交形象，在国际上争取主动。更深一层的原因则是，美国现政府在经过考虑和观察之后，认为支持苏联改革、改善美苏关系符合美国本身利益。
    然而，此间舆论指出，美苏关系作出的新调整，目前大多还限于口头上的意向性的东西，缺少实质性的内容，这些建议里面存在的双方分歧并未减少。就核裁军而言，双方同意明年签约，这是布什政府一个不小变化，但会谈中双方并未就存在的分歧宣布新的立场，而是把分歧留给外长们去解决。因此美国建议要经过很大的努力才能逐步见效。
    欧洲局势是这次美苏首脑会晤面临的重大问题，也是双方会谈的重要话题。但双方对此采取了较为谨慎的态度，向外界透露甚少。从公开言论中，大多是各自阐述的原则性见解，似未形成完整的决策。双方一方面表示它们不想为欧洲勾勒、确定前途，另一方面则声称美苏的合作关系以及各自以自己的方式可以为消除欧洲的分裂、结束欧洲的军事对抗作出贡献。其中对于东欧局势，苏联重申它不加干预，美国则表示它无意从中谋求单方面好处。对于两德关系，美苏尽量避免谈论“德国统一”。苏联的立场是欢迎两德更紧密的经济、文化交往，主张承认两个德国存在的现实，保持现有的边界；美国最近提出的四点原则表态则重申要从欧洲稳定的利益出发，采取和平的、逐渐的步骤，承认欧洲国家的边界。在两个军事集团和欧洲裁军问题上，两国出于不同的原因，没有强调或公开提出进一步裁军的主张，美国继续强调北约存在的必要，苏联也不再强调解散两个军事集团的原有主张，而主张逐步把它们从军事集团变为政治结构。因此从会晤来看，美苏继续主张在保持欧洲稳定的情况下，逐步前进，留待今后继续寻求解决途径。
    这次美苏首脑会晤对美苏关系的发展和东西方关系将会产生重要影响。此间舆论一般都对此作出积极反应，但对会晤的全面评价，一时还难有统一的见解。（本报盛华顿12月4日电）
