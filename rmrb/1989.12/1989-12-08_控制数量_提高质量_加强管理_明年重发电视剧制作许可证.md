Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7th.

    Starting from New Year's Day next year, any production unit providing television dramas to various levels of television stations must hold a newly reissued television drama production permit. This regulation was announced at a press conference held today by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television.

    To improve the quality of television dramas and further strengthen the management of television drama production, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television issued a notice on October 31st this year titled "Regulations on the Implementation of the Television Drama Production Permit System." The production of television dramas in our country has developed rapidly. In 1979, the national television drama output was only about 10 episodes, but this year it has reached more than 3,000 episodes, resulting in a situation of oversupply. Therefore, how to control the quantity and improve the quality has become a prominent issue in television drama production. Moreover, in the past process of issuing television drama production permits, there have been too many and too lax situations, with some units even buying and selling permits and using the opportunity to solicit sponsorship to engage in fraudulent activities. To strengthen management, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television requires, in the new regulations, that all television drama production permits issued nationwide in the past be re-evaluated and reissued according to new requirements. The reissuance work will be completed by the end of this year. Permits are divided into long-term and temporary types. Long-term permits are valid for three years and must be re-applied for upon expiration. Temporary permits are only valid for the reported drama and are invalid for other dramas. The regulations also stipulate that those who violate the regulations will be subject to warnings, criticism, fines, and even revocation of permits.

    Permits will be issued by the Audio-Visual Management Office of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, which will inspect and supervise the personnel, equipment, fund usage, and production of the certified units. Production units that continuously produce substandard television dramas, no longer meet production conditions, or have chaotic internal management will have their permits revoked.

### 控制数量　提高质量　加强管理  明年重发电视剧制作许可证

    控制数量　提高质量　加强管理
    明年重发电视剧制作许可证
    新华社北京12月7日电  （记者秦杰）从明年元旦起，任何制作单位向各级电视台提供电视剧播出，必须持有重新换发的电视剧制作许可证。这一规定是广播电影电视部在今天举行的新闻发布会上宣布的。
    为提高电视剧质量，进一步加强对电视剧制作的管理，广播电影电视部今年10月31日发布了《关于实行电视剧制作许可证制度的规定》的通知。我国电视剧制作发展迅速，1979年全国电视剧产量不过10部（集），今年则达到3000部（集）以上，产生了供过于求的现象。因此如何控制数量，提高质量成为电视剧制作生产中一个突出的问题。而且，在过去发放电视剧制作许可证的过程中，出现了太多、太滥的情况，甚至有些单位还买卖许可证，并利用拉赞助的机会进行诈骗活动。为加强管理，广播电影电视部在新规定中要求，对全国过去发放的电视剧制作许可证重新审核，并按新的要求审批换发新的许可证。换证工作将于今年年底以前完成。许可证分长期和临时两种，长期有效期为三年，期满时须重新申请。临时许可证只限所申报的剧目使用，对其他剧目无效。规定还指出，凡违反规定者，要处以警告、通报批评、罚款，直至吊销许可证。
    许可证由广播电影电视部音像管理处负责发放，他们将对持证单位的人员、设备、资金使用、制作等情况进行检查监督。连续生产劣质电视剧、已不具备制作条件或内部管理混乱的制作单位，将被收回许可证。
