Among the 40,000 workers on the Xijiang River dredging project in Pí County, Jiangsu Province, everyone knows Deputy County Magistrate Huá Huáibó. Everyone affectionately calls him the "Village County Magistrate." As soon as the Xijiang River dredging project began, wherever there were difficult tasks, tough problems, or trouble on any section, Huá Huáibó's figure would appear. Since October 26, Huá Huáibó has been living and eating on the construction site. Every day, he walks the 10-kilometer-long construction site twice for inspections.

On November 13, Huá Huáibó hurried to the Jiākǒu Township construction site. Due to the difficulty of digging the ridges and ditches and the inability to drain the water, Huá Huáibó took off his shoes, rolled up his pants, and jumped into the knee-deep muddy water, wielding a shovel to work hard. That night, the county called him back to attend a performance report meeting. He was busy on the construction site almost the whole night, and on the morning of the 14th, he rushed to the county city's venue. At that time, there was still mud on his hair and behind his ears from the construction site.

    水利工地上的“庄户县长”
    在江苏省邳县西加河疏浚工程工地的4万名民工中，提起副县长花怀柏没有一人不知道。大家都亲切地称他是“庄户县长”。今年西加河疏浚工程一上马，哪里有“卡壳工程”，哪里有啃不动的“硬骨头”，哪个工段出了麻烦事，就有老花的身影。老花打从10月26日进工地，一直吃住在工地。十几公里长的工地，他每天徒步巡查两次。
    11月13日，老花急匆匆来到加口乡工地。由于这个工地垄沟开挖难度大，水排不出去，老花脱掉鞋，卷起裤腿，跳到没膝深的泥水中，挥锨大干。这天晚上，县里打电话让他回去参加述职报告会，他在工地几乎忙活了一整夜，14日早晨匆匆赶到县城的会场，这时他头发上、耳朵后还沾着从工地带来的泥巴。
