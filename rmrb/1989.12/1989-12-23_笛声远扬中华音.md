On a deep autumn night, a large lecture hall in the West Building of Hangzhou University was packed with over 200 students from various departments. They had come to listen to a lecture by Zhao Songting, the chairman of the Zhejiang branch of the Chinese Musicians Association and the "Jiangnan Flute King." The lecture was titled "A Comprehensive Discussion on Flute Art."

With graying temples, Zhao Songting began, "Where is the birthplace of the flute? When did it originate? Some say it was during the Spring and Autumn period over 2,000 years ago, while others claim it was introduced from the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty. In reality, over 7,000 years ago, this land already had the beautiful sounds of the flute." He took out a plastic box from his bag and pulled out three bone pipes, saying, "These are replicas of bone flutes unearthed from the Hemudu Neolithic site in Yuyao, Zhejiang. It has one blowing hole and six finger holes. Now, let Jiang Guoji play this ancient flute."

Jiang Guoji, known as the "Water Town Divine Flute," is Zhao's disciple. He stood up with a smile and played a few notes on the ancient flute made from chicken bones. The sound was high and clear, like bird calls and beast roars. Zhao said, "Art comes from life. Ancient people ate bird and beast meat, sucked the marrow from bones, and found that tubular bones could produce sounds. Thus, they gradually developed it into the flute."

Modern flutes are made of bamboo. When did the bamboo flute originate? Zhao said, "Over 5,000 years ago, during the time of the Yellow Emperor, the climate of the Yellow River region was as humid as it is now in the Yangtze River region, with bamboo everywhere. People's production and living tools were mostly made of bamboo. The bamboo flute originated during that time. Ancient Chinese texts mention bamboo instruments such as sheng, yu, xiao, guan, and chi, but not the word 'flute.' Therefore, some say China is not the birthplace of the bamboo flute. However, according to Zhao's research, in ancient times, 'chi' was pronounced as 'di,' so 'chi' might be the ancient flute. A chi was unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of the Warring States period in Hubei, and it looks very similar to the modern flute." Jiang Guoji played a piece called "Brothers' Song" on the chi, which sounded very similar to the modern flute.

Zhao continued, "In ancient times, the flute was also known as the 'flute of sorrow,' with many famous lines describing its heart-rending sound. For example, in Tang poetry, 'Why should the flute of the Qiang people lament the willows?' Therefore, the flute is a very expressive instrument. It is one of the great creations of our ancestors."

On the left side of the podium, there were more than ten flutes of different lengths. Most of these flutes were handmade by Zhao. Jiang Guoji picked up a small mouth flute and played the Romanian famous piece "Lark," then played the Chinese folk music "Bird in the Shade," with the lively and cheerful bird calls and chirping, making people feel pleasant and refreshing. The students cheered and clapped along with the flute music, dancing and jumping.

Zhao said, "When Jiang Guoji performed in some European countries, the audience stood up and applauded several times. Why? Because the flute is part of our excellent national culture. They are paying respect to this great nation! When doing anything, do not forget to have a foothold, to develop horizontally and vertically from this foothold. This foothold is our excellent and long-standing national culture. If we lose our national culture and let 'blue culture' completely occupy the field, then the culture at that time would be colonial culture, right?"

The classroom was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Zhao continued, "Students, let's join hands and, based on the rich foundation of our national culture, develop our unique Chinese culture. What do you think?"

The classroom erupted in sustained applause.

    笛声远扬中华音
    孟凡夏　黄浩
    深秋的一个夜晚，杭州大学西一教学楼一个大教室里，挤坐着各系科的200多名大学生。他们是来听中国音乐家协会浙江分会主席、“江南笛王”赵松庭讲课的。课题是《笛艺纵横谈》。
    两鬓花白的赵松庭说：“笛子的故乡在哪里？产生于何时？2000多年前的春秋时代才有笛，有说是汉代才从西域引进。实际上，7000多年前，中国这块地方已有笛子的美妙乐声了。”他从包里取出一个塑料盒，从盒里取出3枚水管子说：“这是浙江余姚河姆渡新石器遗址中出土的骨笛复制品，它有1个吹口、6个孔。现在请蒋国基用这种笛吹奏。”
    有“水乡神笛”之称的蒋国基，是赵先生的弟子。他笑盈盈地站起来，用鸡腿骨纺制的古笛，吹出了几个音节，高亢嘹亮，似鸟鸣、如兽叫。赵先生说，艺术来源于生活。原始人食鸟兽肉，吸骨髓，发现管状骨可以发出声音，于是便逐渐将它发展成为笛子。
    现今的笛子是竹制的。竹笛产生于何时？赵先生说，5000多年前的黄帝时代，黄河流域的气候，如同现在长江流域一样温湿，到处是竹子，人们的生产、生活用具很多用竹子制作。竹笛就产生于那个时候。中国古籍所载，竹制乐器有笙、竽、箫、管、篪（音迟），没有“笛”这个字。所以有人说，中国不是竹笛的故乡。但据赵先生查考，古时“篪”读“迪”音，因此，“篪”可能就是古笛。湖北战国曾侯乙墓里就出土了一枝篪，它和现在的笛很相象。蒋国基用篪吹了一曲《伯仲吟》，听起来与现在的笛音大同小异。
    赵先生又说，在古时，笛又被称为“怨笛”，有很多流传千古的名句描写的断肠之声，唐诗中“羌笛何须怨杨柳”就是一个例子。所以，笛子是一种表现力很丰富的乐器。它是我们祖先的伟大创造之一。
    在讲坛左边，摆放着十多枝长短不一的笛子。这些笛子大多是赵先生亲手制作的。蒋国基拿起一个一寸来长的口笛，吹起了罗马尼亚名曲《云雀》，又用笛吹起了中国民乐《荫中鸟》，那轻松活泼的鸟鸣雀噪，使人感到悦耳畅神，同学们随着笛声欢呼鼓掌，手舞足蹈。
    赵先生说：“蒋国基在欧洲一些国家演奏时，听众几次全体起立鼓掌。这是为什么？因为笛子是我们优秀民族文化的一部分，人家是向我们这个伟大的民族致敬哩！做任何事，不要忘了自己要有个立足点，要从这个立足点向纵横发展。这个立足点，就是我们优秀的、源远流长的民族文化。如果丢了民族文化，让什么“蓝色文化”，全部占领了阵地，那时的文化岂不就是殖民地文化了么？”
    课堂里安静得能听一根针落地的声音。赵先生接着说：“同学们，让我们携起手来，在立足于我们民族文化的丰厚基础之上，发展我们极有特色的中华文化，好不好？”
    课堂里发出经久不息的掌声。
