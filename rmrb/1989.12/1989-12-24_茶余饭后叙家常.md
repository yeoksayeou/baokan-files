Recently, I went to the rural areas of Ningxian County in Shaanxi Province. Over tea and meals, I had a casual chat with a 66-year-old grandmother from Yudong Village in Laocheng Township. The following is a record of our conversation:

The farmers are most satisfied with the economic activation, saying life has improved significantly.

I asked, "What are you most satisfied with now?" She replied, "Economically, it's a bit more flexible than before. Labor is arranged by oneself, mountain products can be picked, and goods can be sold, which was not possible before." "How is life now?" "Much better than before. There's no worry about food or clothing, and there's some pocket money. Buying salt and kerosene is no longer a problem."

"How much land does one person have there?" I asked. "Half an acre," she said. "Is that enough?" "It is."

"Are there still any poor households in the village?" I asked. "Yes, there are." "Who are they?" "They are those with many people but few laborers, lazybones, idiots, those with strange diseases, and those who can't manage well." "What do you do about them?" "Rely on the government. As long as the situation is truthfully reported, the government can help solve the problem every year."

The farmers have the most complaints about some grassroots cadres abusing power for personal gain and not serving the people.

When I asked, "What do you have the most complaints about?" she said, "Some cadres don't do things for the people." "If cadres don't do things for the people, what do they do?" "They get rich." "How do they get rich?" "By cutting down trees. They cut down trees and saw them into planks. Some openly pull them out, while others steal them at night. No one says anything to each other. The people are angry, and the bold ones also cut down trees, harming the honest people." "Where are the trees cut from?" "Mostly from the state, and some from the village. During the implementation of the three fixes in forestry, they fought fiercely with the state over the trees, all for this. They treat state property and village property as their own."

"Why doesn't the county government do anything about it?" "The county government? The county government's people only go to the township, and they only see the cadres. Many of them are relatives, and the relationships are warm. Some cover for each other. If they don't say anything, who knows?"

The farmers are most looking forward to having electricity and roads built.

I asked, "What are the farmers most looking forward to?" She said, "Electricity. Our place is less than two miles from the reservoir, but we still use kerosene lamps. The kerosene from the coupons is not enough, and we still have to pay extra." I asked, "How much money does it cost?" She said, "I heard it costs about ten thousand or eighty thousand yuan." "Why not have electricity then?" "Now everything is done by the people and assisted by the government. We really can't afford it."

"What else?" "It's also about building roads." She said, "Without roads, how can we get rich?" "How much road needs to be built?" "Not much. Just a bit more from our place would be enough, and it wouldn't cost much." "The collective contributes money, and the people contribute labor. Wouldn't it be built then?" "The people are willing to contribute labor. Please help us talk about it. Now farmers are generally well-fed and clothed. If the village also has electricity and good roads, the people of our village will never forget the Party for generations."

    茶余饭后叙家常
    刘明儒
    最近，我到陕西省宁陕县农村，茶余饭后，与老城乡浴洞村一位66岁的老妈妈闲谈，记录如下：
    农民最满意的是经济搞活了，日子好过多了。
    我问：“你现在最满意的是什么？”她说：“经济上比过去稍微活套了一点，劳动凭自己安排，山货可以去拾，东西可以去卖，过去不行。”“日子过得咋样？”“比过去好多了，不愁吃不愁穿，手头有了点零花钱，买盐巴，买煤油不发愁了。”
    “你们那里一个人有多少地！”我问。“半亩。”她说“够吃吗？”“够了。”
    “村里还有没有困难户？”我问。“有哩。”“都是些什么人？”“还不是人多劳力少、懒身子、痴汉、得怪病的、不会安排的那些人。”“那怎么办呢？”“靠政府呗。只要如实向上反映，政府哪年都能帮助解决。”
    农民最有意见的是有些基层干部仗权谋私，不为群众办事。
    当我问到“你最有意见的是什么”的时候，她说：“一些干部不给群众办事。”“当干部不给群众办事，那干什么呢？”“发家致富呗。”“怎么个发法？”“砍树呗。砍了树，锯成板子。有的明打明地往外拉，有的半夜三更偷着往外拉，谁也不说谁。群众气不过，胆大的也去砍，就坑了老实人。”“都砍的哪里的树？”“大部分是国家的，队上的也不少。在搞林业三定的时候，他们跟国家争林子争得好凶噢，为的就是这个。他们把国家的东西，村上的东西，当成自己的了。”
    “县上为什么不管管？”“县上？县上来人只到乡上，见的都是干部。好多还是亲戚，关系热着哩，有的人互相包庇，他们不说，谁知道？”
    农民最盼的是拉电、修路“农民最盼的是什么呀？”我问。“拉电。我们那里到水库不到二里路，点的还是煤油灯，凭票的煤油不够点，还得掏议价，”她说。“得花多少钱？”我问。她说：“听说有个万八千元钱也就够了。”“那为什么不拉呢？”“现在什么都要民办公助，实在掏不起了。”
    “还有什么？”“再就是修路。”她说，“没有路，咋致富？”“得修多少？”“没多少。从我们那里往上再修一段就行了，花不了多少钱。”“集体出钱，群众出工，不就修成了？”“群众都乐意出工，请你给我们说一说。现在农民普遍吃饱穿暖，村上再拉上电，修好路，我们村子里的人世世代代忘不了党。”
