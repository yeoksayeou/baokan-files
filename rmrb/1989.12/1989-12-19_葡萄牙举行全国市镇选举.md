Portugal held municipal elections in 4,208 towns across the country on December 17. The mayorships of the capital Lisbon and the northern industrial city of Porto were both won by candidates from Portugal's largest opposition party, the Socialist Party.

According to preliminary election results released by Portuguese television tonight, the alliance of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, People's Democratic Movement, and Green Party won in Lisbon. The alliance's candidate, Socialist Party Secretary-General Jorge Sampaio, secured 48.75% of the votes. In Porto, the Socialist Party candidate Fernando Gomes won with 35% of the votes.

Local observers believe that the Socialist Party's victories in Lisbon and Porto indicate a rise in the party's influence in Portuguese politics, while the ruling Social Democratic Party's influence is waning.

Portugal's 4,208 towns held elections, with 200,000 candidates participating. They represented 12 political parties, 16 electoral alliances, and 292 civic groups, vying for a total of 55,000 positions, including mayors, municipal commissioners, municipal councilors, and district councilors.

    葡萄牙举行全国市镇选举
    新华社里斯本12月18日电葡萄牙17日在全国4208个市镇举行市镇选举，首都里斯本和北部工业重镇波尔图的市长宝座均为葡萄牙最大的反对党社会党竞选人获得。
    据葡萄牙电视台今晚公布的初步选举结果，社会党、共产党、人民民主运动和绿党结成的选举联盟推出的竞选人、社会党总书记若热·桑巴约在里斯本以48.75％的选票当选。在波尔图，社会党竞选人费尔南多·戈麦斯以35％的选票当选该市市长。
    此间观察家认为，社会党在里斯本和波尔图的市镇选举中获胜表明，葡萄牙政坛上社会党的力量在上升，执政的社民党的力量在下降。
    葡萄牙全国共有4208个市镇举行了选举，有20万人参加竞选，他们分别属于12个政党，16个选举联盟和292个市民团体，总共要选出55000个市长、市政委员、市议会议员和区议会议员。
