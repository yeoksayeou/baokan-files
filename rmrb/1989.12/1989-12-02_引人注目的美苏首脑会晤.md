U.S. President Bush and Soviet leader Gorbachev will meet on December 2nd and 3rd on U.S. and Soviet warships in the waters near Malta. This will be the first U.S.-Soviet summit since Bush took office, and it is particularly noteworthy because it is taking place at a time of rapid changes in European affairs and East-West relations. Therefore, observers believe that although there is no fixed agenda for the meeting, European issues and related arms control issues will be important topics of discussion.

Over the past month, developments in Europe have exceeded the expectations of the two superpowers. When the summit was announced at the end of October, the U.S. and the Soviet Union intended to use this informal, high-level meeting to coordinate the pace of bilateral relations. The U.S. hoped to gain firsthand information and insights from the Soviet leadership on reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, so as to adapt to the changes and adjust its own policies, avoiding both losing out due to lack of information and affecting U.S.-Soviet relations and U.S. interests due to improper handling. The Soviet Union, while emphasizing the importance of arms control, does not oppose this exchange of views. It is willing to let the U.S. know more about the reforms and seek Western technological and economic cooperation, but also hopes that the U.S. will not take advantage of the reform process in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to gain propaganda or strategic benefits, disrupt the existing structure of U.S.-Soviet relations, and affect the reform process. However, the development of the situation, especially the opening of the German border and the changes in the political landscape of Eastern Europe, has brought new issues and challenges to the U.S.-Soviet summit. Among the issues that have arisen, such as the future of Europe and the readjustment of German and East-West relations, more serious attention is needed from the two superpowers. Therefore, European issues are more prominent than in any previous U.S.-Soviet summit.

However, European issues not only involve the interests of the U.S. and the Soviet Union but also directly affect the interests of Eastern and Western European countries. Although issues such as German reunification have been widely discussed in Western public opinion for some time, it is now acknowledged that this is a sensitive issue with broad implications and multiple stakeholders, with varying attitudes from different parties. It is not a topic that needs to be or can be resolved at present. Facing the reality of Europe, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have adopted relatively cautious attitudes. Local opinion believes that although the U.S. and the Soviet Union will express their views and stances in the meeting, they will both acknowledge that a calm and peaceful approach is needed to deal with the current situation in Europe, to maintain European stability, and to gradually explore solutions to the problems that have arisen in Europe without disrupting the existing major structure.

The issue of arms control will also occupy a certain position in this meeting. Unlike the Soviet Union's thinking, the U.S. did not originally intend to use this meeting as an opportunity to discuss arms control. However, due to the changes in the European situation, it has objectively presented the possibility and necessity of accelerating the pace of disarmament, coupled with domestic fiscal deficits, Bush changed his mind and decided to use the meeting to explore the possibility of further disarmament. Regarding arms control, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have different plans. The Soviet Union hopes that this meeting can prepare for the formal summit to be held in the spring and summer of next year, laying the foundation for breakthroughs in arms control, especially nuclear disarmament, to further improve the external environment for reform.

As for the U.S., it is brewing a plan to reduce military forces in Europe that will go further than Bush's disarmament proposal in May. It will explore the intentions of the Soviet Union while studying countermeasures for various disarmament proposals that Gorbachev might put forward. Given the reactions of Western Europe, especially Britain, the U.S. has indicated that it will not finalize a deal with the Soviet Union during the meeting but will discuss the situation with its allies before making a decision.

As the U.S.-Soviet summit approaches, the leaders of the two countries have expressed their expectations for the meeting on different occasions, stating their views, but facing the rapid changes in the current situation, no one has made a decision. At the same time, since neither country has had the opportunity to fully consult with its allies, it is unlikely that the two countries will make major decisions on major issues during the meeting. Therefore, it can be seen that this summit will, to a large extent, be an exploratory meeting looking to the future.

    引人注目的美苏首脑会晤
    本报记者　张启昕
    美国总统布什和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫主席将于十二月二日和三日在马耳他附近海域的美苏军舰上举行会晤。这是布什就任总统后的第一次美苏首脑会晤，更引人注目的是，它是在当前欧洲局势和东西方关系发生迅速变化的时刻举行的，因此此间人士认为，虽然会晤事先并无确定议程，但欧洲问题以及与此相关的军备控制问题将成为会晤的重要话题。
    近一个月来，欧洲局势的发展超出了两个超级大国的预料。当今年十月底双方宣布举行首脑会晤时，美苏本打算通过这次非正式的、自由交换意见的高级会晤，调节两国关系的步调。美国打算通过这次会晤，就苏联和东欧的改革从苏联领导人那里了解第一手的情况和看法，以便适应其变化，调整自己的政策，既不要因情况不明而“失去什么”，也不要由于处置不当，影响美苏关系和美国的利益。苏联虽然强调裁军问题的重要，但也不反对这种交换意见的方式，愿意让美国更多了解改革，寻求西方的技术经济合作，但也希望美国不要利用苏联东欧改革的进程，捞取某种宣传或战略好处，打乱美苏关系已有的格局，影响改革的进程。然而形势的发展，特别是两德边界的开放以及东欧政局出现的变化，给美苏首脑会晤带来了新的问题，提出了新的挑战。其中出现的一些问题诸如欧洲的前途以及两德关系和东西方关系的重新调整，更需两个超级大国认真对待。因此，欧洲问题比以往任何一次美苏首脑会晤都显得突出。
    然而，欧洲问题不仅涉及美苏的利益，而且直接关系东、西欧国家的利益。虽然一个时期内，诸如德国统一这样的问题，在西方舆论中谈论甚多，但现在人们不得不承认这是敏感问题，牵涉面广，牵涉的国家多，各方态度各异，它不是当前需要或可能解决的议题。面对欧洲的现实，美苏都采取了较为谨慎的态度。此间舆论认为，虽然在会晤中美苏将各自阐述见解，表示态度，但都会承认，对待当前欧洲的局势，需要采取平静、和平的方式，以保持欧洲的稳定，以便在不打乱现有大的格局的前提下，逐步探求解决欧洲出现的诸问题的途径。
    军控问题在这次会晤中仍占一定的地位。与苏联的想法不同，美国本不打算把这次会晤作为讨论军控的场合，然而由于欧洲形势的变化，客观上提出了加快裁军步伐的可能和必要，再加上国内财政赤字的压力，布什改变初衷，决定利用会晤探讨进一步裁军的可能。对于军控，苏美都有不同的打算，苏联希望这次会晤能为明年春夏举行的正式首脑会晤作准备，为军控特别是核裁军取得突破奠定基础，以进一步改善改革的外部环境。
    就美国来看，它正在酝酿的裁减欧洲军事力量的方案将比布什今年五月提出的裁军计划前进一步。它将探讨苏联的意图，同时对戈尔巴乔夫可能提出的各种裁军建议研究了对策。鉴于西欧特别是英国的反应，美国表明，它不会在会晤中与苏联拍板成交，而将把美苏讨论的情况同盟国商量后，再作决定。
    随着美苏首脑会晤的到来，美苏领导人已经在不同场合表示了他们对这次会晤的展望，表明自己的见解，但面对当前形势的急剧变化，谁也没有做出决策，同时在各自还未能同盟国仔细磋商的情况下，两国似也不可能在会晤中就重大问题作出重大的决定，因此可以看出，这次首脑会晤在很大程度上将是一次着眼今后的探索性会晤。
