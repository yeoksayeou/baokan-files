Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 6th.

To fully utilize revolutionary relics, strengthen revolutionary tradition education, and serve the cultivation of socialist new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline; the propaganda work of revolutionary relics should better adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism. This was the consensus of the representatives attending the symposium on the propaganda work of revolutionary relics held from December 3rd to 6th in Changsha, jointly organized by the Propaganda Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage.

The attendees believed that revolutionary relics refer to the sites, artifacts, and memorial objects from the revolutionary struggles since 1840. Excellent revolutionary traditions and rich revolutionary relics are one of our advantages, and their unique propaganda and educational functions should be fully utilized. The patriotic tradition formed by the Chinese people in over 100 years of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles, especially the proletarian revolutionary tradition cultivated by countless revolutionary martyrs and patriots under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with their blood and lives, is an extremely precious spiritual treasure for our republic and all the people. Long-term revolutionary struggles have left us with a large number of very precious revolutionary relics. So far, there are 206 museums and revolutionary memorial halls nationwide, forming a preliminary network for the propaganda of revolutionary historical sites across the country, systematically reproducing the historical process of the Chinese revolution. Revolutionary relics vividly record the facts of the party and the people's unyielding struggles, are materialized revolutionary traditions, and have the characteristics of being direct, vivid, real, and credible, with unique propaganda functions superior to oral narratives and written materials. Over the past 40 years, the propaganda of revolutionary relics has achieved good results. For example, the former residence of Mao Zedong in Shaoshan and the cave dwellings in Yan'an have long been recognized by the world as witnesses to the history of our party's struggles and symbols of glorious traditions, from which generation after generation of progressive seekers have drawn strength.

The attendees proposed that in the new situation, we should adhere to and carry forward the revolutionary tradition, and oppose the nihilistic trend that denies and defames traditional culture and revolutionary tradition. Some stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization and Westernization often use the weapon of spreading national nihilism and state nihilism, completely denying traditional culture and denigrating our revolutionary tradition. This trend must be resolutely combated.

The attendees unanimously agreed that at present, the focus of revolutionary tradition education and revolutionary relics propaganda should be on several aspects of work: continuing to vigorously carry out patriotic tradition education; seriously propagating the spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, fearing no pressure and no superstition of revolutionary forerunners; especially emphasizing the propaganda and education of the tradition of hard work and self-reliance; paying attention to the education of national spirit and revolutionary spirit.

The representatives hoped that the cultural relics and civil affairs departments would, on the premise of protecting revolutionary relics, turn revolutionary sites, relics, museums, and martyrs' cemeteries into bases for revolutionary tradition education; schools, trade unions, and youth organizations would utilize revolutionary relics to organize a variety of colorful revolutionary tradition education activities; and party history and local chronicles departments would provide historical materials for revolutionary tradition education.

    出席革命文物宣传工作座谈会代表提出
    革命文物是民族宝贵精神财富  教育人民热爱祖国有深远影响
    本报长沙12月6日电　记者吴兴华报道：要充分运用革命文物，加强革命传统教育，为培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人服务；革命文物宣传工作要更好地坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向。这是出席12月3日至6日由中宣部宣传局和国家文物局联合在长沙召开的革命文物宣传工作座谈会代表的一致意见。
    与会代表认为，革命文物是指1840年以来历次革命斗争的遗址、遗物和纪念性实物。优良的革命传统和丰富的革命文物是我们的一大优势，应该发挥它特有的宣传教育作用。我国人民100多年反帝反封建斗争中形成的爱国主义传统，特别是在中国共产党领导下，由千千万万革命先烈、爱国志士用鲜血和生命培育起来的无产阶级革命传统，是我们共和国和全体人民的一笔极其宝贵的精神财富。长期革命斗争给我们留下了大量的十分珍贵的革命文物。到目前为止，全国建有博物馆、革命纪念馆206所，在全国范围内初步形成了一个革命史迹宣传网，比较系统地再现了中国革命的历史进程。革命文物形象地记录着党和人民前赴后继斗争的史实，是物化了的革命传统，具有直观、生动、真实、可信的特点，有着优于口头记述、文字材料的特殊宣传功能。40年来，革命文物的宣传收到了很好的效果，如毛泽东同志在韶山的旧居、在延安的窑洞，早已成为世人公认的我们党的斗争历史的见证和光荣传统的象征，一代一代追求进步的人从这里吸取了力量。
    与会代表提出：要在新形势下坚持、发扬革命传统，反对否定、诋毁传统文化和革命传统的虚无主义思潮。一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、主张全盘西化的人，常用的一个武器就是散布民族虚无主义和国家虚无主义，全盘否定传统文化，全盘贬损我们的革命传统。对这股思潮，必须迎头痛击。
    与会代表一致认为，当前，革命传统教育和革命文物宣传重点应该抓好几个方面的工作：继续大力抓好爱国主义传统教育；认真宣传革命先辈敢于斗争、敢于胜利、不怕压、不信邪的硬骨头精神；特别突出地抓好艰苦奋斗传统的宣传教育；重视抓好民族气节和革命气节教育。
    代表们希望，文物、民政部门要在保护好革命文物前提下，把革命遗址、遗迹、博物馆、烈士陵园办成革命传统教育的基地；学校、工会、团组织要利用革命文物，组织开展丰富多采的革命传统教育；党史、地方志部门要为革命传统教育提供历史资料。
