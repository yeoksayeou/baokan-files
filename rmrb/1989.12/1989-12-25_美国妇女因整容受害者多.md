	The number of impostors posing as beauticians in the United States is on the rise, causing tens of thousands of women not only to fail in becoming more beautiful but also to become "unfit for work" due to their disfigurement. This new social problem has become so severe that it has prompted Congress to dispatch investigators to look into the matter.

	Last year, approximately 620,000 Americans underwent plastic surgery, of which 85 percent were women. This year, 100,000 women have already had breast augmentation surgery; 75,000 have undergone facial reconstruction; 17,000 have had chin implants; 95,000 have received new noses; and 250,000 have had liposuction. Most of the patients have had good results.

	The problem lies with the unaccountable number of quack plastic surgeons. They exploit women's desire for beauty, placing deceptive advertisements in newspapers to lure women into spending money on fraudulent procedures. The number of such "operations" far exceeds the official statistics kept by the Plastic Surgery Association by more than double.

	A congressional subcommittee heard the testimonies of victims. One woman, who had a scar on her face, fell for the sweet talk of a quack "doctor" who promised a "chemical peel and scar revision" surgery. The result was a disfigured face. The "doctor" had applied an acidic liquid to her face, burning her facial skin, corroding her corneal tissue, and leaving a hole in her eyelid. She also lost her vision.

	Such operations by quacks typically cost $5,400, while breast augmentation costs $2,500. These unlicensed charlatans can earn as much as $400,000 a year.

	The chairman of the congressional subcommittee, Robert Weiden, called for stricter enforcement of medical practice regulations and urged states and cities to restrict the publication of false plastic surgery advertisements. However, just as drugs and AIDS are difficult to control in the United States, it is no easy task to expose these quack doctors and put an end to their schemes.

    美国妇女因整容受害者多
    陈封
    冒充美容医师的骗子在美国越来越多，使成千上万名妇女不但没有变美，反而成为“无法返工”的丑妇。这个新社会问题已经严重到引起国会派专人进行调查的程度。
    去年有约六十二万美国人经历过整形手术，其中百分之八十五是妇女。今年已有十万妇女作过乳房扩张手术；七点五万人作过重整面容手术；一点七万人作过移植下巴手术；九点五万人安装了新鼻子；二十五万人作过消除肥膘手术。大部分求治者都有良好效果。
    问题发生在无法统计的冒牌整形外科医生的手术刀下。他们利用妇女爱美的心理，在报刊上大作蛊惑人心的广告，诱骗妇女去花钱上当。这类“手术”的数字，比整形外科医生协会的正式统计超出一倍以上。
    众议院一个专门小组听取了受害者的控诉。一位妇女的脸上有一块疤痕，她误信了某江湖“医生”的花言巧语，请他进行“化学揭皮补疤”手术，结果变成了丑八怪。因为那位“医生”在她脸上涂抹的酸性液体侵蚀了面部皮肤，烧伤了眼睛的角膜并在眼睑上烧了一个洞。她的视力也丧失了。
    作这种手术，庸医一般要收五千四百美元，扩充乳房的价格是二千五百美元。这类没有行医执照的骗子医生的年收入往往高达四十万美元。
    众议院专门委员会的主席罗·威登要求政府严格执行医生开业的考核规章，并呼吁各州、市限制刊登虚假的整形外科手术广告。然而，正如毒品和艾滋病这些社会罪恶在美国无法遏制一样，要揭开那些骗子医生的面皮示众，使他们计无所售，谈何容易。
