    "Dalian Shuguang Insulation Materials Factory has really been 'amazing' these past few years!" This is what those in the know say—
    The colored polyester film they produce fills a gap in Liaoning Province and is at the advanced level nationwide;
    The paper-plastic composite bags they produce have reached the advanced level of domestically produced equipment of the same type;
    The polyester film they produce has been successively rated as a quality product by the Dalian Municipal Government and the National Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries.
    A township enterprise with only 230 employees has relied on what to continuously develop and become a shining "star enterprise" in Dalian? Factory Director Shao Dechang gave us an answer: "For an enterprise to develop, the key is in cultivating people."

    This factory has about 60% young workers. Young people often gather together, and their topics of conversation have three main themes: talking about money, talking about wives, and talking about fate. After research, the factory made a decision: to hold a business skills competition throughout the factory, with classes every month, exams after class, and public posting of each worker's learning scores.

    Young workers have a strong desire to improve themselves, and no one wants their name to be at the bottom of the list. The factory has a library with over 4,000 books, which is crowded with workers, and a librarian is almost overwhelmed.

    The learning competition has been a powerful boost to the enterprise's development. Now, the factory's film production success rate has reached 76%, the highest in the country.

    When discussing this achievement, Director Shao looks further ahead: Workers who read good books and strive for progress mean that the factory's future is full of hope!

    Taking advantage of young people's tendency to make friends, the factory pairs them with mentors, organizing a "mentorship ceremony."

    Worker Zhang Wenliang has a high school education and is one of the factory's "high achievers." Director Shao thought, "He is a smart kid, if guided properly, he can become a good worker." Just at this time, the electrical workshop needed people, and Zhang Wenliang asked Director Shao to learn electrical work. Director Shao agreed: "As long as you find a mentor, you can learn." Soon, Zhang Wenliang found Party member Chen Dianxi to be his mentor, and in the year-end evaluation, he was rated as an advanced young worker in the entire factory.

    关键在于育人
    “大连曙光绝缘材料厂这几年真‘神’了！”知情人都这么说—— 
    他们生产的彩色聚脂膜，填补了辽宁省的一项空白，并且是全国同类产品的先进水平；
    他们生产的纸塑复合袋，达到了国产设备同类产品的先进水平；
    他们生产的聚脂薄膜，先后被大连市和国家农牧渔业部评为优质产品。
    一个仅有二百三十名职工的镇办企业，靠什么不断发展，成为大连市的一个闪亮的“明星企业”？厂长邵德昶给了我们一个回答：“企业要发展，关键在育人。”
    这个厂，青年职工占了百分之六十左右。小青年平日聚在一堆儿，话题有三多：讲钱多、讲媳妇多、讲命多。经过研究，厂里做出一项决定：在全厂开展学业务竞赛，每月上课，课后考试，并张榜公布每个职工的学习成绩。
    青年工人上进心强，谁也不甘心自己的名字写在榜尾。厂里有个藏书四千多册的图书馆，被工人挤得满满的，一个图书管理员简直应接不暇。
    学习竞赛对企业发展是有力的促进。如今，这个厂拉膜成品率达到了百分之七十六，是全国最高的。
    邵厂长在谈到这一收获时看得更远：工人们读好书，求进步，工厂的明天就充满了希望啊！
    针对青年人好结朋交友的特点，厂里让他们与师傅结对子，搞了个“拜师会”。
    工人张文良高中文化，是厂里的“高材生”。邵厂长想，他是个聪明的孩子，若引导得法，他能成为一个好工人。恰在这时，电工班要人，张文良找邵厂长申请要学电工。邵厂长答应他：你只要找到师傅，就可以学。很快，张文良找到党员陈殿喜作师傅，他在年终评比中被评为全厂先进青年。《大连晚报》记者　丁学忱　陈永江
