The European Community plans to establish an internal single market by the end of 1992. Currently, there are three years left until this deadline, so how has the construction of the internal market progressed?

	(1)

The basis for building the internal market is the "White Paper on Completing the Internal Market," which was published in 1985 and officially came into effect in July 1987. The "White Paper" outlines 279 measures for the construction of the internal market. By examining the drafting, passage, and implementation of these measures, the progress of the single market construction becomes clear.

To implement the aforementioned measures, the European Commission has submitted 274 proposals to the Council of the European Communities. However, these proposals have not been easily approved by the Council. So far, the Council has approved 148 items. Additionally, the ministers of the 12 member states have reached a common position on another 13 items and made "partial decisions" on 7 more, totaling 168 items. In other words, the remaining three years should be used to pass the remaining 111 items in two years, leaving one year for the national parliaments to approve these measures. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the 111 items that have not yet been passed all involve the difficult issues of removing internal barriers and achieving the "four freedoms" (free movement of goods, services, people, and capital). It is questionable whether the Council of the European Communities can tackle these "hard nuts" one by one within two years.

As for converting the Council's resolutions into national laws for approval and implementation, it is even more difficult. Among the 148 resolutions already passed by the Council, only 88 have been approved by national parliaments and implemented into law. Of these 88 items, only 14 have been approved and implemented by all member states, 15 have been approved by 9 countries, and 52 have been approved by 8 countries.

Among the measures that have not yet been passed, several are particularly difficult and pose significant obstacles to the path of integration. First, the issue of indirect taxation. Indirect taxes mainly refer to value-added tax (VAT) and, to a lesser extent, consumption taxes. The VAT rates in the 12 countries vary greatly, with different tiers. For example, West Germany has two VAT rates of 7% and 14%, while Greece is as high as 36%, and Italy reaches 38%. Consumption taxes are similar; for instance, the tobacco tax in Denmark is as high as 86%, in Greece it is 55%, and in Spain it is as low as 22%. The European Commission's proposed plan is to gradually align the indirect taxes of each country towards a "middle line" and ultimately achieve uniformity. Since VAT is closely related to national revenues, it is extremely difficult to narrow such a large gap! Second, the issue of animal and plant health inspection regulations. To protect their own environment, public health, and economic development, each European Community member state has its own strict regulations, banning certain animal and plant products from entering, such as West Germany not allowing French beef and wheat to enter, and Britain not allowing mainland dairy products to cross the Channel. The problem lies in the fact that the standards of each country's regulations are not uniform and the differences are too great, making coordination within the European Community very difficult. Of the 111 decisions the Council is about to make, 48 fall into this category. Third, the issue of "European Citizenship." This is the most difficult barrier to remove among the tangible barriers of various countries. Because to achieve the free movement of people, one must have the freedom to cross borders, establish businesses, and reside. Due to the significant differences in social welfare, economic development levels, and employment situations among countries, there are sharp conflicts of interest in the issue of free movement of people. No one wants their enterprises to be squeezed out or controlled by others, and no one is willing to let foreigners share their national income and welfare spending. The "rich countries" in the community are particularly unwilling to have residents from "poor countries" settle on their territory.

By the end of 1992, will the European Community be able to solve the aforementioned problems and tackle these three "bones"? The answer is likely to be negative.

The European Community's determination to build an internal single market stems from their strong sense of urgency about the development of the world situation, that is, in the context of increasingly fierce international economic competition, to stand firm and compete with the United States and Japan on a global scale. However, the recent changes in the international situation have caused cracks in the unified will to strengthen unity for self-preservation, adding new difficulties to the construction of the internal market.

First, the North-South conflict within the European Community has intensified. Generally speaking, in the European Community countries, the North is rich and the South is poor. For many years, there have been conflicts over the regional development fund issue. Southern countries want to obtain more aid, while Northern countries are not so willing to contribute. Now, with the changes in the situation in Eastern Europe, especially in West Germany, the interest in aid has shifted towards Eastern Europe. In West Germany's view, whether from historical, geographical, ethnic factors, or from economic interests or development prospects, the benefits of going east are clearly much greater than going south. Southern countries have frequently warned their wealthy partners not to neglect old friends for new ones.

Second, there is the issue of the speed of integration. With the changes in the international situation, there are differing opinions on whether to accelerate or slow down the speed of integration, and a heated debate is brewing. Countries like Belgium, which have been relatively active in the construction of the European Community, are now slow in converting the decisions of the European Community into national laws. The Community has long been avoiding internal development of "two speeds," because once "two speeds" really form, the European Community's single market will not be "unified." However, the problem of "two speeds" is becoming increasingly apparent.

Finally, the "Franco-German axis" is facing a serious challenge. The cooperation between France and Germany is an important guarantee for the development of the European Community. Currently, France wants to accelerate the construction of the European Community, while West Germany shows signs of having its own plans. Taking the Strasbourg summit as an example, France did not want to discuss the German reunification issue, but West Germany insisted on discussing it, making the German reunification issue appear for the first time in the official documents of the meeting. France hopes to convene an intergovernmental conference as soon as possible to amend the existing treaties and prepare for the transition to the second stage of economic and monetary integration, but West Germany first opposed it and later agreed to convene it by the end of next year, but its negative stance has not changed. The differing attitudes of France and Germany will inevitably affect the construction of the single market.

Despite the aforementioned difficulties, the overall interests of the 12 countries will drive them to unite and strive to achieve the goal of building a single market. The single market will continue to develop in the set direction. However, it can be said that this development will be slower and more difficult, and it is uncertain whether the single market can be realized by the end of 1992 as planned.

### 欧洲大市场建设的困难及前景

    欧洲大市场建设的困难及前景
    本报记者　魏崴
    欧洲共同体计划在1992年底建成内部统一大市场，现在，离这个限期还有三年，内部市场建设的进展如何？
                          （一）
    建设内部市场的依据，主要是1985年问世，1987年7月正式生效的《关于完成内部市场》的白皮书。《白皮书》规定内部市场建设的措施共有279项。看一看这些措施的拟订，通过及执行情况，大市场建设的进展情况便一目了然了。
    为实施上述措施，欧共体委员会已向欧共体理事会提交了274项建议，但这些建议到了理事会，通过起来就不怎么顺当了。现在理事会已通过了148项，加上12国有关部长们已就另外13项达成了共同立场，就另7项作出了“部分的决定”，算在一起共为168项。换句话说，剩下的三年时间，应该用两年通过余下的111项，再留下一年的时间让各国议会批准这些措施。但是，困难在于这尚未通过的111项，内容均是有关消除内部壁垒，实现“四流通”（即商品、劳务、人员和资本的自由流通）的难题。欧共体理事会能否在两年之内逐一啃完这堆“硬骨头”，是个疑问。
    至于把理事会的决议转到各国议会去批准生效，就更难了。在理事会已经通过的148项决议中，现在获国家议会批准、形成法律且已付诸实施者，只有88项。而在这88项中，被全体成员国的国家议会批准生效者，只有14项，被9国批准生效者15项，8国批准生效者52项。
                          （二）
    尚未通过的措施中，有几项的难度特别大，是一体化道路上很难逾越的障碍。一、间接税制问题。所谓间接税，主要指增值税，其次是指消费税。12国的增值税率差别极大，档次也不同。如西德的两档增值税率分别为7％和14％，而希腊高达36％，意大利竟至38％。消费税亦如此，如卷烟税，丹麦高至86％，希腊则为55％，西班牙低到22％。欧共体委员会酝酿中的方案是设法使各国间接税分期向“中间线”靠拢，最后实现统一。增值税与各国收入息息相关，要缩小如此大的差距，谈何容易！二、动植物卫生检疫规定问题。为保护本国的环境卫生、公众健康及经济的发展，欧共体各国都有自己的严格规定，禁止某些动植物产品入境，如西德不许法国牛肉、小麦进入，英国不许大陆的牛奶过海峡。问题在于各国的规定标准不一，悬殊太大，欧共体内部经常为此争吵不休，协调起来十分困难。理事会将要做出的111项决定中，就有48项属这一领域。三、“公民的欧洲”问题。这是诸国有形壁垒中最难消除的一个。因为要实行人员流通的自由就得有过境、兴办企业和居住的自由。由于各国社会福利相差很大，经济发展水平极不平衡，就业情况悬殊较大，因此在人员自由流通这个问题上，各国的利益尖锐冲突。谁都不愿意自己的企业被别国的挤垮或为他人操纵，谁都不甘心让国外来客分享本国的国民收入和福利开支，共同体的“富国”尤其不希望“穷国”的居民到自己领土内定居。
    到1992年年终之际，欧共体能否解决上述难题，啃光这三根“骨头”？回答多半是否定的。
                          （三）
    欧共体决意建设内部统一大市场，源自他们对世界形势发展所产生的强烈紧迫感，即在国际经济竞争日趋激烈的背景下，为站稳脚跟，在世界范围内与美、日抗衡。然而，近一年来国际风云的变幻，却使加强联合以自保的统一意志出现了裂痕，给内部市场建设增添了新的麻烦。
    首先，是欧共体内的南北矛盾加剧。一般地说，在欧共体国家中，是北富南贫。多年来，南北在地区发展基金问题上一直存在着矛盾。南方国家想多争得些援助，北方国家在出钱时却总不那么痛快。现在，随着东欧局势的变化，北方国家尤其是西德，开始将援助兴趣转向东欧。在西德看来，无论从历史、地理、民族的因素或是从经济利益或发展前景考虑，向东比向南的好处明显大得多。南方诸国已频频警告富有的伙伴们不要有了新朋，冷落了旧友。
    其次是一体化速度的问题。随着国际形势的变化，是进一步加快还是放慢一体化的速度，各国意见分歧，正酝酿着激烈的辩论。像比利时这样一直对欧共体建设较积极的国家，而今在把欧共体的决议转为本国法令时却慢慢腾腾的。共同体一直在避免内部发展的“两种速度”，因为一旦真的形成“两种速度”，欧共体大市场便“统一”不成了，而今，“两种速度”的问题却日益明显地表现出来了。
    最后是“法德轴心”面临严重挑战。法德两国合作一致是欧共体发展的重要保障。现法国想加快欧共体建设的步伐，西德却流露出自有打算的意思。以斯特拉斯堡首脑会为例，法国本不想谈两德问题，西德坚持要谈，使德国统一问题首次列入会议正式文件。法国希望早日召开政府间会议，以修改现有条约，为经济和货币一体化向第二阶段过渡作准备，西德先是反对，后来又同意在明年年底召开，但其消极立场未变。法德态度不一，必将影响大市场建设。
    尽管存在着上述种种困难，欧共体诸国全局性利益的需要，会使12国联合起来，努力实现建设大市场的目标。大市场也会沿着既定方向继续发展下去。不过，可以肯定这个发展将更为缓慢，更为艰难，大市场能否在1992年底如期实现很难说。
