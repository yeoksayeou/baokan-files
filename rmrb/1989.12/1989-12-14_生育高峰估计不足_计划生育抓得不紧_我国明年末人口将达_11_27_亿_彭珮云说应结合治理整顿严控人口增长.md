Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th.

The director of the State Family Planning Commission, Peng Peiyun, recently stated that family planning work should be effectively integrated with the ongoing economic restructuring. We must further seriously implement strict population control and improve population quality, alleviate the contradictions between rapid population growth and economic development, and help the national economy quickly move towards a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

Statistics show that China's total birth rate in 1989 is expected to exceed 23 million, with a birth rate of over 21‰. The natural increase in population is expected to exceed 16 million, with a natural growth rate of around 15‰. By the end of the year, the total population is expected to reach approximately 1.112 billion. By the end of 1990, the total population is expected to reach approximately 1.127 billion, exceeding the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" population target by about 14 million.

Peng Peiyun discussed the reasons for the continuous overshooting of population plans since 1986: First, when formulating the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" population targets, the new birth peak was underestimated, and the country's ability to control population growth was overestimated, leading to overly tight population control targets. Second, there were issues in the implementation, with some regions not strictly enforcing family planning policies and measures, and most rural grassroots work being weak. They have not yet taken effective countermeasures against the new situations and problems arising from the reform and opening-up. Third, population statistics are inaccurate, and the gap between household registration and sample survey estimates is widening. The number of births reported in family planning reports is approximately 30% less than the number estimated through sample surveys.

Peng Peiyun then mentioned the upcoming fourth national census starting next year. She said that family planning is a fundamental national policy, and one of the important purposes of the census is to serve the implementation of this fundamental policy. Through the census, the long-standing issues of underreporting and concealment of births will be better addressed, and the true population of China will be accurately determined. This will further improve family planning, population control, and population management work.

    生育高峰估计不足　计划生育抓得不紧
    我国明年末人口将达11.27亿
    彭珮云说应结合治理整顿严控人口增长
    据新华社北京12月13日电  （记者于长洪）国家计划生育委员会主任彭珮云日前说，计划生育工作应同治理整顿很好地结合起来，我们要进一步认真做好严格控制人口和提高人口素质的工作，缓解人口增长过快同经济建设之间的矛盾，使国民经济尽快走上持续稳定协调发展的轨道。
    据统计，预计我国1989年全年出生人数将超过2300万，出生率将超过21‰，自然增长人数将超过1600万，自然增长率将达到15‰左右，年末总人口将达到11.12亿左右，1990年年末总人口将达到11.27亿左右，超过“七五”人口计划1400万左右。
    彭珮云谈了1986年以来人口计划连年突破的原因：一是制定“七五”人口计划时，对新的生育高峰估计不足，对我国现阶段控制人口的能力估计过高，致使人口计划指标订得偏紧；二是工作上的问题，一部分地方的计划生育工作抓得不紧，措施不力，大部分农村基层工作薄弱，对改革开放形势下出现的一些新情况新问题还未能采取有效的对策；三是人口统计数字不准，而且户口登记同抽样调查推算的数字差距有逐年增大的趋势。计划生育报表汇总的出生人数比通过抽样调查推算的出生人数大约少30％。
    彭珮云由此谈到了将于明年开始的第四次全国人口普查。她说，计划生育是我国的基本国策，人口普查的重要目的之一是为贯彻执行这一基本国策服务。通过人口普查，将较好地弄清历年出生人口漏报、瞒报的问题，真正查明我国的人口总数，从而进一步搞好计划生育和人口控制、人口管理工作。
