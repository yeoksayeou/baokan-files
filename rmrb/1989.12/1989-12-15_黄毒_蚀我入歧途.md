Yellow Poison Leads Me Astray

I was sentenced to two years of re-education through labor by the public security authorities last April for hooliganism. In the Henan Kaifeng City Labor Re-education School, on this land soaked with bitterness and regret, I have spent several hundred days and nights.

Under the guidance of the "special gardeners," I deeply realize that "martial arts novels, pornographic publications, and obscene videos" are the root causes of my crimes.

From elementary school to the first year of junior high, my academic performance was always good. However, in recent years, I read martial arts novels in class and watched unhealthy videos whenever I had the chance. I became mired in the quagmire and couldn't extricate myself. Beautiful fantasies made me feel like a martial arts master, surrounded by beautiful women, ruling over a territory.

Once, a friend gave me a handwritten book, and with great curiosity, I couldn't wait to read it in class. The school expelled me. From then on, I drank alcohol and fought during the day, and at night, I hid in the video hall with my "little brothers" to enjoy "yellow spiritual food."

From curiosity to obsession, from being infatuated with the low-level and vulgar descriptions and obscene scenes in the books to having a strong desire to imitate them, I, along with a few close friends, went to the school gate several times to intercept female students, demanding that they become my "friends." If they refused, we would threaten and intimidate them. One day, due to a dispute over a girl, we had a bloody brawl with another gang at the entrance of a cinema. I stabbed the opponent three times.

This is how I, a good student, became a lawbreaker. Learn from my lesson!

    “黄毒”蚀我入歧途
    河南开封市劳动教养学校学员　孟令强
    我因流氓滋事于去年4月被公安机关批准劳教两年。在河南开封市劳动教养学校，这块浸透着辛酸与悔恨的土地上，我已度过了几百个日日夜夜。
    在“特殊园丁”们的教育、感化、挽救下，我深刻地认识到“武侠、黄色书刊和淫秽录像”是诱发我犯罪的根源。
    从小学到初中一年级，我的学习成绩一直不错。可近年来我上课看武侠书，一有机会就逃学看那些不健康的录像。陷入了泥潭难以自拔。美好的幻想使我仿佛成了一名武艺超群、美女追逐、独霸一方的侠客。
    一次，一哥们送我本手抄本，我带着强烈的好奇心迫不及待地在课堂上偷看起来，学校给我开除学籍的处分。从此，我白天喝酒打架无恶不作，晚上躲在录像厅里和“小兄弟”们共赏“黄色精神食粮”。
    由好奇到入迷，由迷恋书中低级下流的描写和淫秽场面，到产生强烈的模仿而和几个铁哥们几次到学校门口拦截女学生，强求对方和自己交
  “朋友”，不从就恐吓、威胁。一天，因争风吃醋，我们和另一帮人在电影院门口发生一场流血械斗，我将对方连扎3刀。
    这就是我从一个好端端的中学生走向违法犯罪的经历。吸取我的教训吧！
