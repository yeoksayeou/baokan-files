United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on the 8th "strongly appealed" to the international community to provide more food aid to Ethiopia, which is plagued by famine.

It is reported that years of famine have caused more than a million Ethiopians to flee the country. In November, Ethiopia announced that due to continuous droughts, a large-scale famine would once again break out in northern Ethiopia.

    德奎利亚尔呼吁向埃提供食品
    联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔八日“强烈呼吁”国际社会向遭受饥荒侵扰的埃塞俄比亚提供更多的食品援助。
