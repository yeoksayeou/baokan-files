Individual industrial and commercial households frequently engage in tax evasion and avoidance. According to statistics from some cities, varying degrees of tax evasion and avoidance, when combined, generally account for around 80%. In cities like Beijing and Shanghai, it has been discovered that a few individual households have evaded and avoided taxes amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. In Shandong Province, 50 households have been found to have evaded and avoided taxes exceeding 100,000 yuan, with the largest amount evaded and avoided by a single household reaching over 600,000 yuan. The reasons for tax evasion and avoidance by individual households include a lack of tax consciousness and illegal profit-seeking. Additionally, the tax authorities lack accurate bases for assessing the business income of individual households, making it difficult to strictly enforce their legal tax payments, which is another significant factor.

The tax authorities in Hebei Province have addressed the above situation by implementing a reward ticket system, which was first piloted in Tangshan City. The State Taxation Administration sent personnel to assess the pilot's effectiveness in Tangshan, noting that tax revenues had increased severalfold, and concluded that this system is an effective measure to reduce tax losses and ensure the normal fiscal revenue of the state under current circumstances.

The implementation of the reward ticket system can encourage consumers to develop the habit of asking for receipts when shopping, thereby strongly urging individual households to comply with the law and pay taxes.

Furthermore, the widespread implementation of the reward ticket system allows for the tracking of store sales prices, which helps to curb arbitrary price increases.

Why not give it a try in places with suitable conditions?

    何妨一试
    季一
    个体工商户偷税漏税现象比较普遍。据一些城市统计，不同程度的偷漏税，加起来一般在80％左右。北京、上海等城市已发现少数个体户偷漏税有高达十几万元的，山东省已查出偷漏税10万元以上的有50户，最大的一户偷漏税高达60多万元。个体户偷漏税的原因，除本身缺乏纳税意识，非法图利外，税务部门对个体户营业所得缺少准确核定的依据，无法严格约束其依法缴纳税款，也是一项重要原因。
    河北省税务部门针对上述情况，推行有奖发票制度，并首先在唐山市率先试行。国家税务总局派人了解唐山试行效果良好，税收成倍增加，认为：此项制度在目前情况下，不失为减少税款流失，保证国家正常财政收入的一种有效办法。
    推行有奖发票制度，可促进消费者养成购物索取发票的好习惯，有力地督促个体户走上遵法纳税的正道。
    此外，有奖发票制度广泛推行后，商店售货价格有据可查，也有利于制止乱涨价的行为。
    有条件的地方何妨试一试？
