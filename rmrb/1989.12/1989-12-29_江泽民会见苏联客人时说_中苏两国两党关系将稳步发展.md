Jiang Zemin Meets Soviet Guests, Says Sino-Soviet Relations Will Develop Steadily

	BEIJING, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin said today that Sino-Soviet relations will develop steadily on the basis of the four principles of party-to-party relations and the five principles of peaceful coexistence, in accordance with the spirit and agreements reached during the summit meeting between the two countries' leaders in May this year.

	Jiang made the remarks when he met with Farin, a member of the CPC Central Committee and head of the International Department of the CPSU Central Committee, in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon.

	Jiang said that China began to establish special economic zones in the early 1980s, and he was one of the participants in the establishment of these zones. At that time, he served as deputy director of the State Commission for Import and Export Control, in charge of this work. Practice has proved that our open policy has achieved great success. Jiang stressed that reform is the self-improvement of the socialist system and must adhere to the correct direction. It must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party, which is determined by Chinese history.

	In discussing China's relations with socialist countries, Jiang pointed out that China is a socialist country, and it is undeniable that we are concerned about the development of the situation in socialist countries. But we never interfere in other people's affairs. We oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the imposition of influence in various forms.

	Before the meeting, Soviet Ambassador to China Troianovskii handed over letters personally written by CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev to Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. During the meeting, Farin also handed over a personal letter from Gorbachev to Jiang. Jiang expressed his thanks for this.

	Present at the meeting were CPC Central Committee member and head of the International Liaison Department Zhu Liang, CPC Central Committee alternate member and deputy head of the International Liaison Department Li Shuzhen, and Soviet Ambassador to China Troianovskii.

	On Dec. 24 and 25, Zhu Liang and Li Shuzhen held talks with Farin, during which the two sides exchanged information on their respective domestic situations and views on international developments and issues of common concern.

	Farin and his party arrived in Beijing on Dec. 23 and will leave for home on Dec. 29.
