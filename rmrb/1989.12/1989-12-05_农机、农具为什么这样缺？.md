During the harvest season in rural Jiangsu, you will see that some farmers use sickles that are thinner and shorter than normal. One farmer, holding a sickle, said, "This sickle has been sharpened and repaired many times and has been used for 4 years, but it still hasn't been replaced." The reason? Good ones can't be bought.

Small tools are like this, and the situation with agricultural machinery is also problematic. If a furrow opener breaks down, spare parts can't be bought, so the old method of manual furrowing has to be used. What would normally take 3 hours to complete takes 3 days with manual labor. During a good harvest, threshing is a big deal, and people are busy looking for threshing machinery.

In companies that operate agricultural production materials, there are few types and quantities of agricultural machinery and tools. It's hard to buy things like water pumps and feed grinders. The reason is that there are no suppliers. So, where have the agricultural machinery production factories gone?

According to a survey by the rural enterprise management department of Nanjing City, in 1988, the entire city had only 15 agricultural machinery production factories, which is 1/5 of the number in 1983. Moreover, some of these enterprises do not primarily produce agricultural machinery and tools, and the small and medium-sized agricultural machinery and tools they produce are only enough for local use. Another 10 enterprises produce 1/3 agricultural machinery and tools, and 2/3 other processed products. For example, the Yu Hua Agricultural Machinery Factory now mainly produces industrial dust removal equipment and pressure vessels, and only produces small agricultural tools as a sideline. Due to many agricultural machinery factories changing their line of business, the quantity and variety of agricultural machinery have significantly decreased. According to statistics from Nanjing City, the annual production of small and medium-sized agricultural tools decreased from 2,235,800 in 1983 to 1,820,400 in 1988; the annual production of semi-mechanized agricultural tools decreased from 1,914 in 1983 to 508 in 1988. The change in the direction of agricultural machinery factories and the significant reduction in agricultural machinery products have caused concern for agricultural production and increased the labor intensity of farmers.

Upon investigation, the reasons for agricultural machinery and tool production enterprises changing their line of business are as follows: First, the price of raw materials for agricultural machinery production has risen significantly, and the state implements price controls on agricultural machinery and tools, making it difficult for many enterprises to absorb the costs, resulting in severe internal losses. Second, there is no fixed source of raw material supply. If agricultural machinery production enterprises rely on buying high-priced raw materials to produce low-priced agricultural machinery and tools, it will be very difficult to survive.

Agricultural machinery and small agricultural tools are essential for farmers' production. Currently, increasing investment in agriculture, expanding the production of agricultural machinery and small agricultural tools to meet farmers' needs is crucial. This should be highly regarded by relevant departments, and effective policy measures should be taken to enhance the vitality of agricultural machinery and tool production enterprises, making due contributions to supporting agricultural production.

    农机、农具为什么这样缺？
    陈治海　曾阳
    收获季节到江苏农村，你会见到，一些农民使用的镰刀比正常的镰刀要薄要短。一个农民手里掂着镰，口里说，这把镰刀磨了又磨，修了又修，已用了4年，还没有换。原因呢？买不到好的。
    小农具如此，农机具的情况也问题不少。开沟机坏了，买不到配件，只好拿出以前的土办法：人工开沟。本来3个小时就可以干完的活儿，用人工要花3天时间。丰收了，脱粒是个大事，人们又为找脱粒机械而奔忙。
    经营生产资料的公司里，农机具品种少，数量也少，像抽水机、饲料粉碎机很难买得到。原因是没有进货厂家。那么，农机具生产厂家哪里去了呢？
    据南京市乡镇企业管理部门调查，1988年全市农业机械生产厂家只有15个，是1983年的1／5，其中一部分企业还不是以生产农机具为主，所生产的中小型农机具只够本乡用。另10个企业1／3产品是农机具，2／3产品是其它加工产品。如雨花农机厂，现在是以生产工业除尘设备和压力容器为主，附带生产小型农具。由于许多农机具厂家改行，使农机数量和品种大幅度地减少。据南京市统计，1983年中小农具年产量223.58万件，1988年只有182.04万件；半机械化农具年产量由1983年1914件下降到1988年的508件。农机厂的改行和农机具产品的大量减少，给农业生产带来了忧虑，同时，增加了农民的劳动强度。
    经了解，农机具生产企业改行的原因：第一，农机生产的原材料价格上升幅度较大，国家对农机具实行限价，大批企业难以消化，内部亏损严重。第二，原材料供应没有固定来源。如果农机具生产厂家靠买高价原材料生产低价的农机具，是很难生存的。
    农机和小农具是农民生产的必备条件，当前，增加向农业的投入，扩大农机和小农具的生产以满足农民的需要，至关重要，应引起有关部门的高度重视，采取切实有效的政策措施，增强农机具生产企业的活力，为支援农业生产作出应有的贡献。
