People's Daily, Jinan, December 20th - Reporter Jia Jianzhou reports: Shandong Province, which lists basic education as a "strategic industry," is willing to make "long-term investments." Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, the provincial Party committee and government have mobilized various industries and the broad masses to invest, raise funds, and donate 3 billion yuan for education. This has not only completed the task of renovating rural primary and secondary school buildings but has also made significant progress in renovating urban primary and secondary school buildings.

Shandong, a province with a tradition of promoting education, has over 80,000 primary and secondary schools with 12 million students enrolled. More than 80% of these schools and students are in rural areas. Since the founding of New China, the province's education sector has developed significantly, but the conditions for rural education remain quite harsh. As late as 1978, more than half of the rural primary and secondary schools were still in a state of "dark rooms, mud platforms, and muddy children inside." Someone once calculated that if the state were to bear the entire cost of renovating rural primary and secondary school buildings, with an annual investment of no more than 20 million yuan, it would take about 130 years to complete the task.

To fill the huge gap in education investment, Shandong Province adopted the policy of "state, collective, and individual all participating." Over the past 10 years, the province has raised funds from various sources to build 14 million rural primary and secondary school classrooms, totaling 280 million square meters, which is 106% of the actual school building area before 1979. Many places have also built libraries, laboratories, equipped sports facilities, opened production bases, and built teachers' dormitories. The province has also completed the renovation of urban primary and secondary school buildings in 20 counties and cities.

Many places in Shandong Province have summarized a rule from their practice: poverty - not focusing on education - lack of talent - economic stagnation - continued poverty, this is a vicious cycle; poverty - tightening belts to invest in education - cultivating talent - economic development - from poverty to prosperity, this is a virtuous cycle. After the masses understood the principle of "treat poverty by treating ignorance, and treat ignorance by investing in education," the enthusiasm for promoting education reached an unprecedented height. The revolutionary old base area of Linyi, to change the vicious cycle and get rid of the poor face, mobilized the masses to raise 100 million yuan in 1985, and completed the task of renovating primary and secondary school buildings the following year.

In the process of increasing education investment through multiple channels and forms, Shandong Province, in addition to mobilizing the masses to raise funds for education, mainly focused on the following aspects: First, ensuring "two increases" with fiscal allocations. By 1988, the province's fiscal budget education expenditure reached 1.84 billion yuan, accounting for 18.8% of the total fiscal expenditure, an increase of 3.4 times over 1978, with an average annual growth rate of 15.9%, exceeding the same period's fiscal expenditure annual growth rate of 11.8%. Second, making full use of the education surcharge policy. Since the education surcharge was levied in 1986, by 1988, the province had accumulated 1.255 billion yuan in education surcharges. Third, supplementing education funds with income from part-time work and thrift.

To mobilize the enthusiasm of various levels to run schools, Shandong Province boldly reformed the school leadership and management system, implementing a tiered management system for primary and secondary schools in 1985. The province clearly stipulated that townships are responsible for running junior high schools, central primary schools, and central kindergartens; villages are responsible for running primary schools and kindergartens in their own villages. This corrected the long-standing problem of unclear jurisdiction, mutual blame-shifting, lack of school funding, and no one in charge of school renovations, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of various levels to run schools. Pingdu City's Cuijiaji Town took out 2 million yuan accumulated over the years and mobilized the masses to raise more than 50 million yuan, making the township central primary school even better.

    发展“战略产业”　舍得“长效投资”
    山东十年集资三十亿元办教育
    农村城镇中小学校舍改造取得重大进展
    本报济南12月20日电　记者贾建舟报道：把基础教育列为“战略产业”的山东省，舍得“长效投资”。改革开放10年来，省委、省政府发动社会各行业和广大群众投资、集资、捐资30亿元办教育，不仅完成了农村中小学校舍改造任务，而且在城镇中小学校舍改造方面也取得重大进展。
    具有兴学重教传统的孔孟之乡，山东省共有中小学8万多所，在校学生1200万人，其中农村中小学校和在校学生均占80％以上。新中国成立以来，全省教育事业虽有较大发展，但农村办学条件仍相当艰苦。直到1978年，“黑屋子，土台子，里面坐着泥孩子”的状况，尚占农村中小学半数以上。有人曾算过一笔帐：农村中小学校舍改造任务如果全由国家包下来，按每年最多投入校舍改造费2000万元计算，约需130年才能完成。
    为弥补教育投资上的巨大缺口，山东省采取“国家、集体、个人一齐上”的方针，近10年来，全省多方筹集资金，先后修建农村中小学校舍140万间、2800万平方米，相当1979年前实有校舍面积的106％。许多地方还建设了图书资料室、实验室，配备了文体器材，开辟了生产基地，兴建了教师宿舍。全省还有20个县市区完成了城镇中小学校舍改造。
    山东省许多地方从实践中总结出这样一条规律：贫困——不抓教育——人才匮乏——经济不能振兴——继续贫困，此乃恶性循环；贫困——勒紧裤带办教育——造就人才——经济发展——由穷变富，此乃良性循环。广大群众明白了“治穷先治愚，治愚办教育”的道理之后，兴学重教的热情空前高涨。革命老根据地临沂地区为改变恶性循环，摆脱贫穷面貌，1985年发动群众集资1亿元，第二年便完成了中小学校舍改造任务。
    在坚持多渠道、多形式增加教育投入中，山东省除发动群众集资办学，主要抓了以下几点：一是财政拨款确保“两个增长”。到1988年，全省财政预算内教育经费支出18.4亿元，占财政总支出的18.8％，比1978年增长3.4倍，平均年递增15.9％，超过了同期财政支出年递增11.8％的增幅。二是用足用好教育费附加政策。自1986年开征教育费附加以来，到1988年全省累计征收教育费附加达12.55亿元。三是用勤工俭学收入补充教育经费。
    为调动各级办学的积极性，山东省大胆改革学校领导管理体制，自1985年对中小学实行了分级办学、分工管理。省里明文规定，乡镇负责兴办初中、中心小学和中心幼儿园；村负责兴办本村小学、幼儿园。这样，纠正了长期存在的各级职权范围不清、互相扯皮推诿、办学资金无着落、校舍改造无人管的现象，大大调动了各级办学的积极性。平度市崔家集镇把历年积累的20万元拿了出来，又发动群众集资50多万元，使乡镇中心小学办得好上加好。
