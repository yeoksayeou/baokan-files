	First Time Seeing My Father
	Huang Zhenzun

	Mother told me that my grandfather went to Singapore to work when he was over twenty and died of overwork before he was thirty, thrown into the sea by his boss to feed the fish. Forty-five years ago, on the third day after I was born, my father also followed in the footsteps of his ancestors. From then on, my mother and I relied on the money he sent back from abroad to live.

	From the time I became aware, I longed to see my father every day. But the years passed like the cries of the swallows, and even after I graduated from university, I still hadn't seen him return. I remember in the summer of 1966, Mother wrote from our hometown to tell me that Father would be coming back for the Mid-Autumn Festival to reunite with us! At that time, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights. But things are never smooth, and when the moon was full, the people were not. An "unprecedented" movement began, and I also began to receive the "baptism" of the movement—being investigated, sent to labor, and even my father's address was confiscated... After a series of ordeals, I went from being innocent and carefree to being gloomy and depressed, and my feelings for the bonds of kinship seemed to have turned cold.

	Just as spring brings revival to the earth, the spring breeze of reform and opening up and the policy towards overseas Chinese blew away the gloom in my heart and warmed my cold, disappointed heart. I eagerly picked up my pen to write to my father, pouring out my longing for him. Father replied: "I will return to Tangshan, arriving at Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport on the xth day," and enclosed a photograph—a spirited and kind-looking old overseas Chinese, clearly visible.

	At the airport, my heart began to flutter: could I recognize my father? There are so many overseas Chinese, how could I recognize and ask each one? The airport staff were moved by this rare reunion in the world and enthusiastically helped me find thick cardboard and red ink to make a large sign with the words "Overseas Chinese Mr. ×××, your son" written in bold red characters. I held it high like a flag at the airport exit, and in the other hand, I held the photograph.

	I don't know how long I waited, but suddenly an elderly man dressed in a suit, somewhat resembling my father, walked unsteadily to my side and stood still. His gaze moved from the sign I was holding high to my face, staring at me for a long time, as if trying to figure out if my appearance was the son he had imagined. I suppressed my pounding heart and quickly asked him in our hometown dialect. He moved closer to me, and seeing the photograph I held up to him, he was suddenly overjoyed. The moment of separation and reunion in this world had finally come to an end. At this moment, my father, who had been away from home for nearly half a century, could not say a word, but I saw him extend his trembling hands and tightly embrace me, his face streaked with shining tears. I was also very moved, and for a moment, I was speechless, only nestling in his arms like a child, letting him embrace and stroke me. The onlookers also gathered around, watching us with happy smiles.

	On the way home, Father was very emotional. Looking at his son, who was thin and had grayed early, he said with deep affection, "Child, you've suffered... why don't you come with me abroad!"

	Speaking of going abroad, more than twenty years ago when I was in university, it happened to be a difficult time for the country. Father had also entrusted a friend who was returning to China to handle my emigration procedures. At that time, the words "going abroad" were not in my mind. I still recited my own poems at the university student's welcome party: "... Motherland nurtures me, how can I leave my motherland?" Such lines, this scene, I have not forgotten, although during this period I have experienced many ups and downs in life.

	I understand Father's feelings very well. As a lonely old man abroad, he needs his children by his side and a warm and lively home to enjoy his old age! I held back tears and introduced to him the current policies of the Party towards overseas Chinese and intellectuals, as well as the stable and harmonious life of my family. Father might have felt my deep affection for the motherland and did not mention it again. On the day of his departure, he held my hand and said, "Child, stay in the country at ease. After I go abroad, I will also try to support the construction of the Four Modernizations for my motherland and do my part for my country... I will be 80 years old next year, and it's time to return to my roots..."

    第一次见到父亲
    黄璋尊
    听母亲说，我祖父二十多岁就到新加坡做工，不到三十便累死，被老板抛下大海喂了鱼。四十五年前，当我呱呱坠地的第三天，父亲也踏上祖辈的后尘。从此，我和母亲就靠他节衣缩食寄回的钱养活了。
    从懂事时起，我就天天盼着见到父亲。可是，燕子声声，年复一年，直到我大学毕业还没见他回来。曾记得1966年夏天，母亲从家乡来信告诉我，说父亲“中秋节要回来团圆了”！当时我听了兴奋得几个夜晚没合上眼。谁知好事多磨，月圆人不圆，一场“史无前例”开始了，我也开始接受
  “运动的洗礼”被审查，去劳动，连父亲的通信地址也被抄走……一番劫难，我由天真烂漫变得郁郁寡欢，对人生的骨肉情也似乎冰冷了。
    正像春天给大地万物以复苏一样，党的改革开放的春风和侨务政策，吹掉了罩在心头的沉郁，温暖了我冰冷、失望的心。我欣然拿起笔来给父亲写信，向他倾吐思念之情。父亲回信了：“即回唐山，×日到广州白云机场相见”，并夹带一张照片——一位精神焕发，显得慈祥的老华侨，赫然在目。
    到了机场，我的心倒翻腾起来了：能辨认出父亲吗？侨客又多，怎能逐个去认去问？机场的同志对我这种人世间的离散聚合很感慨，热情地为我找来厚纸板、红墨水，制成一块大牌子，上面写着端端正正的大红字：“泰国华侨×××大人，您的儿子”。我像擎起一面大旗一样，将它高举着站在机场的出口处，另一手拿着相片。
    不知等了多久，忽然有一个身着西装，模样有点像父亲的老人，步履蹒跚来到我的跟前站定，目光从我高举的牌子移到我脸上，久久地凝视着我，似乎是在捉摸我这模样是不是他想象中的儿子。我按捺着忐忑跳动的心，赶忙用家乡话探问他。他向我靠近，又看到我亮在他面前的照片，登时他惊喜了，人世间久别久离终于到了穷尽的时刻了。此时，背井离乡近半个世纪的父亲，一句话都说不出来，只见他伸出那颤颤抖抖的双手，将我紧紧地搂抱着，脸上纵横着晶莹的老泪。我也格外激动，一时无语，只是像小孩似地偎依在他的身上，任他搂抱，抚摸。在场的服务员也都簇拥过来，用幸福的笑脸围观着我们。
    回家的路上，父亲很是感慨，他望着我这又消瘦又早生华发的儿子，深情地说：
  “孩子，你受苦了……还是跟我出去吧！”说着他又流下了眼泪。
    提起出国，早在二十年前我读大学时，正遇上国家困难时期，父亲也曾委托一位回国探亲的朋友为我办理出国手续。那时我脑子里根本没有“出国”二字。我还在大学生联欢晚会上朗诵自己的诗作：“……祖国母亲哺育我，我怎能离开祖国母亲？”这样的诗句，这情景，至今我没有忘怀，虽然这期间我经历了人世间的许多风风雨雨。
    父亲的心情我十分理解，他一个孤寡老人在外面，是多么需要儿女在他身边，需要有个热热闹闹的家以享晚年啊！我含着泪水，向他老人家介绍了如今党的华侨政策、知识分子政策，以及我一家过着安定和睦生活的情景。父亲也许感受到我对祖国眷恋之情，也就不再提了。临别那天拉着我的手说：“孩子，你安心在国内吧，我出去后也要想法支援祖国建设四化，为自己的祖国出点力……明年我就80岁了，也该落叶归根了……”
