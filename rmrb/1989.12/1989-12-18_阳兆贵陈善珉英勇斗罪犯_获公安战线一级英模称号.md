The Ministry of Public Security recently issued an order, posthumously awarding Yang Zhaogui and conferring Chen Shanmin with the title of First-Class Model of the Public Security Front.

The order states that on August 17, 1989, Yang Zhaogui, the director of the Forensic Science Department of the Public Security Bureau of Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, engaged in a life-and-death struggle with criminals while investigating a major theft case. He sacrificed his life heroically.

The order also states that Chen Shanmin, a national labor model, second-class model, and the head of the Fujian Railway Public Security Bureau's Fuzhou Station Police Station, discovered an armed criminal while on duty on November 27, 1989, and attempted to capture him. Despite being shot twice in the chest and abdomen, Chen Shanmin continued to direct his comrades in capturing the criminal. The criminal was apprehended, preventing a planned violent robbery by an armed criminal gang and a larger bloodshed incident.

    获公安战线一级英模称号
    据新华社北京12月17日电  公安部近日发布命令，分别追授和授予阳兆贵、陈善珉公安战线一级英模称号。
    命令说，1989年8月17日，云南省新平彝族傣族自治县公安局侦技科科长阳兆贵在侦破一起重大盗窃案件时，只身同罪犯进行殊死搏斗，壮烈牺牲。
    命令说，全国劳模、二级英模、福州铁路公安分局福州车站派出所主任干事陈善珉在1989年11月27日执勤时，发现一名持枪歹徒并上去捕捉。陈善珉在胸、腹部中两弹的情况下，仍顽强指挥战友捕捉罪犯。罪犯被擒获，避免了一个持枪犯罪团伙预谋进行暴力抢劫活动和更大流血事件的发生。
