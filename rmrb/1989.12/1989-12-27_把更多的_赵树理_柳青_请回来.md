Title: Bring Back More "Zhao Shuli" and "Liu Qing"

It is reported that last year, our country produced more than 150 films of various genres, but fewer than 10 were set in rural areas. How about this year? The relevant departments responded: "Even 10 films cannot be completed. The reason is simple: films set in rural areas do not make money." What a regrettable response! In a country where 80% of the population are farmers, films reflecting rural life account for less than 7%. To be honest, some of our writers, screenwriters, and directors probably haven't even thought about reflecting the life of farmers in the 1980s. Farmers say: quickly bring back "Zhao Shuli" and "Liu Qing."

When it comes to box office success, films like "Jiyingmen" and "Our Cow Hundred Years" are not only popular in rural areas but also packed in many cities. Can it be said that people do not like rural-themed films? When it comes to making money, the countryside is a vast market for films and television. The problem lies in the fact that in recent years, many urban cultural and artistic departments have forgotten about the countryside and farmers.

Our country has a group of writers who write about rural themes. They have written many works about the changes in the countryside over the past decade of reform, but overall, there are still too few. The countryside is eager for writers and artists to step into the fields and enter the homes of farmers, to understand their thoughts and lives, and to write about the new-type farmers of the 1980s.

### 把更多的“赵树理”“柳青”请回来

    把更多的“赵树理”“柳青”请回来
    据报载，我国去年生产各种题材影片150余部，其中农村题材不足10部。今年如何？有关部门回答：“10部也完成不了。其原因很简单，农村题材的影片不赚钱。”多么遗憾的回答呀！一个80％的人口是农民的国家，反映农村生活的影片却不足7％。说实在的，我们的一些作家、编剧、导演们是不是压根儿就没想到去反映80年代的农民生活。庄户人说：赶快把“赵树理”、“柳青”请回来。
    谈到上座率，《喜盈门》、《咱们的牛百岁》不但在农村受欢迎，而且在不少城市也都满座。这能说没人喜欢农村题材吗？谈赚钱，农村是个广阔的影视市场。毛病出在近几年不少城市文化艺术部门忘却了农村和农民。
    我国拥有一批写农村题材的作家，他们写了许多改革10年来农村变化的作品，但总的讲还是少了一些。农村多么希望作家、艺术家踏上田园、走进农家，了解他们的思想和生活，写一写80年代的新型农民。
