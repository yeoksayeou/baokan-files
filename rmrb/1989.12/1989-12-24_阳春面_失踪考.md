Title: The Mystery of the Disappearing "Yangchun Noodles"

In the small noodle shops along the streets of Shanghai, there used to be two large, steaming pots on the stove. One pot would be filled with bone broth, and the other with boiling water. Next to the stove, there would be a small table with about twenty bowls, each containing a bit of soy sauce and green onions. When a customer arrived, the noodles would be quickly cooked and then placed in a bowl, topped with a ladle of bone broth, and served. Generally, two bowls of noodles would be enough for a meal, costing only a few jiao, making it both economical and affordable. Since there were no additional toppings, the noodles were simply white and plain, hence the name "Yangchun Noodles," derived from the phrase "Yangchun Baihua" (a metaphor for elegant and refined art). Using this highbrow term for a simple and affordable dish like plain noodles is a testament to Shanghai residents' sense of humor.

Recently, I visited Shanghai hoping to eat Yangchun Noodles, but after visiting three or four food stalls, I couldn't find them anywhere. When I asked my Shanghai friends, they said, "Now that living standards have improved, not many people eat Yangchun Noodles anymore." Another friend said, "Selling Yangchun Noodles isn't very profitable."

Has the living standard of Chinese people really reached the point where no one needs to eat Yangchun Noodles? From my own observations and those of my ordinary worker, cadre, teacher, and citizen friends, whether it's food, clothing, or daily necessities, practical and affordable items are still the primary choices for most people. To say that no one wants to eat Yangchun Noodles, I don't believe it.

"Profit is small," this is probably the truth, because now almost all kinds of food are moving towards high-end and high-priced products. Since we are in a market economy, making money seems to be the inevitable goal. However, we are indeed practicing a socialist market economy, and we should ultimately serve the majority of the people. Is it appropriate to blindly pursue "high-end" products, detached from the living realities of the majority? Yangchun Noodles, come back!

    “阳春面”失踪考
    上海沿街的小面店里，过去灶上总是坐着两口热气腾腾的大锅。一口熬着骨头汤，一口是滚动着的开水。灶边小桌上，并排放着一二十只碗，里面都有少许酱油和葱花。吃客一到，面下锅即熟，捞起来放入碗中，浇一勺骨头汤，就可以吃了。一般人两碗面就可以当一顿饭，花几角钱就够了，既实惠又便宜。因为没有任何浇头，只是雪白一碗，所以取名“阳春面”，取义于“阳春白雪”。将曲高和寡的“阳春白雪”用于价格低廉、大众化的光面，恐怕也要算是上海人的幽默了。
    最近去上海，还想吃阳春面，跑了三四家吃食店，就是不见它的踪影。问及上海的朋友，一曰：“现在生活水平提高了，阳春面不大有人吃了。”二曰：“卖阳春面赚头小。”
    中国人的生活水平真的到了都不必吃阳春面的地步了吗？我从自己及周围普通的工人、干部、教师和市民看，无论吃的、穿的、用的，实惠、便宜的东西，还是人们的主要选择对象。要说没人要吃阳春面，我不信。
    “赚头小”，这大概是实情，因为现在的各种食品，几乎都在向高档高价挺进。既然是商品经济，赚钱似是题中应有之义。但是我们毕竟是搞社会主义商品经济，总要以为大多数人服务为根本宗旨啊。离开中国国情盲目追求“高档”，脱离大多数人的生活实际，这样的经营方向对头吗？阳春面，回来吧！
