North and South Korea's sports talks working representatives meet again

New China News Agency, Pyongyang, December 6 - (Reporter Zhū Kèchuān) North Korea and South Korea held their second working-level meeting today to discuss forming a unified team for the 11th Asian Games. Both sides reached a partial agreement on the issue of athletes' joint training.

According to reports, this non-public working-level meeting was held in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission conference room in Panmunjom. Both sides discussed the selection of athletes for the unified team, joint training of athletes, and how to determine the team leader.

After negotiations, the points on which both sides reached a consensus were: the training of athletes participating in the unified team will be divided into joint training and comprehensive training. The number of people participating in joint training will be based on the number of registrants determined by the Asian Games organizing committee. Joint training activities will begin one month after the establishment of the North-South Unified Team Joint Committee.

Regarding the issue of the team leader, the North's representatives proposed having a co-leader, i.e., two leaders, to promote reconciliation and unity between the North and South. The South's representatives proposed that the leader should be from the side with more athletes in the unified team, and the other side should be the deputy leader. No agreement was reached on this issue. No results were achieved on the issue of athlete selection. Both sides agreed to meet again on December 15.

    朝鲜北南双方体育会谈工作代表再次接触
    新华社平壤12月6日电  （记者朱克川）朝鲜北方和南方为组成统一队参加第十一届亚运会而进行的体育会谈今天举行了第二次工作代表级的接触，双方就运动员的联合训练问题达成了部分协议。
    据报道，这次非公开举行的工作代表接触是在板门店中立国监察委员会会议室举行的。双方讨论了参加统一队的运动员选拔方式、运动员的联合训练和如何确定统一队的团长人选等问题。
    经过协商，双方取得一致意见的内容是，把参加统一队的运动员的训练问题分为联合训练和综合训练，参加联合训练的人数以亚运会组委会确定的报名人数为准，联合训练活动将在成立北南统一队共同委员会后的一个月内开始进行。
    关于团长人选问题，北方代表主张设共同团长，即两位团长，以促进北南方的和解与团结。南方代表主张由参加统一队的运动员人数多的一方担任团长，另一方担任副团长。在这个问题上双方没有达成协议。在运动员选拔方式问题上也没有取得结果。双方商定12月15日进行下一次接触。
