    People's Daily, Chengdu, December 29th - Reporter Luo Maocheng reports: Sichuan Province has taken the "vegetable basket" seriously, ensuring that the province's vegetable production and supply in the off-season have achieved a good situation with abundant quantity, diverse varieties, high quality, and stable prices with a downward trend. Both producers and consumers are relatively satisfied.

    According to statistics from 19 cities including Chengdu, Chongqing, and Deyang, the total vegetable supply from January to November this year reached 310 million kilograms, an increase of 13.6% compared to the same period last year. The per capita daily vegetable supply for residents is 488 grams. The average retail price of main vegetable varieties managed by state-owned vegetable companies is 28.24 yuan per 100 kilograms, a decrease of 15.6% compared to the same period last year. The average price of vegetables in markets is 60.9 yuan per 100 kilograms, a decrease of 11.67% compared to the same period last year. The price difference between large cities and medium-sized and small cities has significantly narrowed, and the vegetable supply for residents in most county-level cities has also improved significantly.

    Vegetable supply is related to every household. To ensure this work, the provincial government established a leading group for urban vegetable production and sales this year. Various regions have successively formulated and implemented the mayor (county magistrate) responsibility system for vegetable production and sales. The province has allocated 10 million kilograms of grain for vegetable exchange and 500 tons of fertilizer to the commercial department in one go. Various cities and counties have taken practical measures, stabilized vegetable bases, strictly controlled the occupation of vegetable fields, and seriously cleaned up the existing vegetable field area and occupation situation. Currently, the province's vegetable base has reached 351,000 mu, with 2.8 mu of vegetable fields per capita. Sichuan Province has also adjusted the variety structure reasonably according to market needs, creating good conditions for the balanced supply and price stabilization of vegetables.

    数量足  品种多  质量好
    四川蔬菜价格稳中有降
    本报成都12月29日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省认真抓好“菜篮子”，使全省蔬菜生产和供应在淡季出现数量足、品种多、质量好、价格稳中有降的好形势，生产者和消费者都比较满意。
    据成都、重庆、德阳等19个城市统计，今年1月至11月蔬菜总上市量达3.1亿公斤，比去年同期增长13.6％，居民人均日供菜488克。国营蔬菜公司经营的主菜品种的零售平均价为每百公斤28.24元，比去年同期下降15.6％，集市蔬菜平均价为每百公斤60.9元，比去年同期下降11.67％。大城市菜价和中小城市菜价之间的地域差明显缩小，多数县级城市居民的蔬菜供应也有明显改善。
    蔬菜供应牵涉到千家万户。为了抓好这一工作，今年省政府成立了城市蔬菜产销工作领导小组，各地相继制定和落实了蔬菜产销工作市（县）长负责制，全省一次性拨给商业部门换菜粮1000万公斤，化肥500吨。各地市从实际出发，还抓了稳定蔬菜基地，严格控制征占菜地，对现有菜田面积、征占情况认真清理。目前，全省蔬菜基地已达35.1万亩，居民人均菜地2.8厘。四川省各地还根据市场需要合理调整品种结构，为蔬菜均衡上市、平抑菜价创造了良好条件。
