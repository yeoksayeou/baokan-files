The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory in Hebei Province is renowned for its rigorous management, which has led to excellent economic performance. Last year, it ranked second in the province for tax and profit contributions. This year, it is expected to achieve a new record high in tax and profit contributions. Establishing regulations: leaders must lead by example

Implementing strict management requires the establishment and improvement of rules and regulations. The factory has referenced both domestic and international advanced management experiences, combined them with its own realities, revised and added various rules and regulations, and set evaluation standards. Beyond these rules and regulations, what is even more valued is the factory leadership's requirement: workers must do what is required of them; cadres must do what is required of them; and factory leaders must lead by example.

Last year, a fire nearly occurred due to someone carelessly discarding a cigarette butt. Three days later, the factory issued a new regulation: smoking is strictly prohibited in the factory area during working hours. Previously, there were designated smoking rooms in the production workshops, and management personnel could smoke in their offices. With the new regulation, the entire factory became a non-smoking zone. Although most of the factory leaders are smokers, from the day the regulation was issued, no one was allowed to violate this rule within the factory. Deputy Director Cheng Deming is known as an "old smoker," but to lead by example, he quit smoking, and this regulation has been well-maintained throughout the factory. First, investigate the responsibilities of the factory leaders when there are problems.

Once, the packaging workshop had a quality accident involving the wrong product. Director Li Guoting quickly made a public self-criticism, sincerely stating that although the problem occurred below, the root cause was his own inadequate management and education work. He requested that the finance department deduct 10% of his monthly salary according to the factory's reward and punishment regulations.

For mistakes in work, the factory leaders also bravely expose themselves to higher-level leaders. In the first quarter of this year, the factory overcame difficulties in funds and raw materials, and completed production and tax targets well. However, due to inadequate maintenance of some equipment, the operating conditions were not good, resulting in the failure to complete the production plan for filter-tipped cigarettes. The factory leaders seriously investigated the responsibilities they should bear and self-punished by forfeiting all bonuses for the first quarter and 10% of the April salary. The factory also dispatched the deputy director in charge of equipment, Li Yuancheng, to Beijing to return the "Excellent Equipment Management Unit" award cup, originally awarded by the former State Economic Commission and the National Tobacco Corporation, to the National Tobacco Corporation, explaining the situation, and making a self-criticism. Strict management requires fairness above all

In addition to the factory's regulations, the factory party committee also established "six rules," clearly stipulating that whether it is the factory leaders or ordinary cadres, no one is allowed to seek special treatment, accept invitations, accept gifts, take shortcuts, pursue fame and fortune, or engage in activities that violate party policies.

In 1984, the factory, based on actual needs, selected 28 workers from various workshops to do general work in the offices, some of whom were children of cadres. Workers had some opinions about this. The factory leaders, upon hearing this, decided to return all 28 people to their original workshops. Moreover, from then on, they added a regulation that all office positions requiring cadres must be publicly advertised and selected based on merit. Other matters such as external training and further education also adopted the same method. This way, "connections" and "face" lost their market value.

The personal integrity and honesty of the factory leaders undoubtedly enhanced the appeal of their strict management. It also enabled them to handle any person or matter that violated the rules and regulations without leniency or compromise. A worker, relying on his relative being a high-ranking official, had a strong background, and no one dared to do anything to him. He was free and easy, openly violating the factory's relevant regulations. After the factory leaders learned of his situation, their attitude was clear: no one in the factory is a special worker. Quickly, the factory made a decision to dismiss this worker and publicly announced it. Subsequently, the factory leaders called this responsible comrade to inform him of the factory's decision, asking him to support the factory's work and to do ideological work for his relative.

If you ask the factory workers who works the hardest, you will almost certainly get the same answer: the factory leaders. This is indeed the case.

Factory Party Secretary Li Changxin's family is in Beijing. Since he transferred from the military to work in the factory more than ten years ago, he has hardly taken any leave to visit his family. Even when he used the opportunity of a business trip passing through Beijing to visit his family, it was always a brief visit. As long as Old Li is in the factory, his working hours cannot be calculated by the 8-hour workday system; he often works until late at night. Yet, during his rare annual Spring Festival leave, he strictly adheres to labor discipline. This Spring Festival, on the afternoon of New Year's Eve, he was still working in the factory, and everyone he met urged Old Li to go back to Beijing to reunite with his family. He just smiled and said, "The workers are still on duty producing, how can I leave the factory?" When he returned to Beijing alone on New Year's Eve, other families were already enjoying the Spring Festival Gala on CCTV, enjoying family happiness. The factory regulations stipulate a 5-day holiday for the Spring Festival, but he did not wait to complete his leave and returned to the factory on the fourth day to plan various tasks after the Spring Festival.

The factory leaders work the hardest, but since the restoration of bonuses, their bonuses have never exceeded the average level of workers. In the factory, the bonuses of management cadres are lower than those of other workers, and the bonuses of factory leaders are only at the average level of management cadres, about 20 yuan per month. Regarding this issue, the factory leaders have publicly announced: "The director and secretary will not envy the workers' wages and benefits being higher than ours. Because we are Communist Party members, we must endure hardships first and enjoy later."

    打铁先得自身硬
    ——张家口卷烟厂从严治厂纪实
    王克强　刘军
    河北省张家口卷烟厂以管理严格而获得好的经济效益。去年上缴税利居全省第二位。今年税利可望再创历史最高水平。订制度领导要率先执行
    实行严格管理，离不开建立健全规章制度。厂里参考中外先进的管理经验，结合本厂实际，修订、增订了各项规章制度，制定了考核标准。在这些规章制度之外，更被人看重的是厂领导要求：工人做到的，干部要首先做到；要求干部做到的，厂领导要首先做到。
    去年，因有人乱丢烟蒂引起烟尘土着火，险些酿成火灾。第三天，厂子颁布了一项新制度：工作时间在厂区内一律禁止吸烟。厂里抽烟职工多，过去，生产车间有专门的吸烟室，管理干部在办公室里可以抽。新制度一颁布，全厂处处成为禁烟区了。尽管厂领导多半有吸烟嗜好，但从颁布制度那天起，谁也不准在厂内违反这条制度。副厂长程德明称得上是“老烟枪”，为了带头执行制度，他戒了烟，这条制度也在全厂很好地坚持了下来。有问题先查厂领导的责任。
      一次，包装车间发生了错装品种的质量事故，厂长李国庭很快作出了公开检讨，诚恳地表示，问题虽然发生在下面，究其原因是自己平常管理、教育工作做得不细致所造成的。他要求财务科按照厂子的奖惩规定，扣了自己当月10％的工资。
    对工作中的失误，厂领导还勇于到上级领导面前亮丑。今年第一季度，厂子克服了资金、原材料等方面遇到的困难，产值、税利等项指标均完成得不错，只因为部分设备缺乏保养，运转状况不太好，导致过滤嘴卷烟没有能够完成产量计划。厂领导认真查找了应该承担的责任，并全部自罚了第一季度的全部奖金以及4月份10％的工资。厂子还委派主管设备的副厂长李源诚专程到北京，将原国家经委和全国烟草总公司授予的“设备管理优胜单位”的奖杯，退回给全国烟草总公司，说明原委，做了自我批评。严格管理要公字当头
    除了厂里制定的规章制度，厂党委还“约法六章”，明确规定，不论是厂领导还是一般干部，都不许搞特殊、不准吃请、不准收礼、不走后门、不争名利、不干违反党的政策的事。
    1984年，厂子根据实际需要，曾从各车间抽调了28名工人到科室做一般工作，其中有一部分是干部子女。职工们对此有些看法。厂领导闻过便改，决定将这28名人员全都退回原来所在车间。而且从那时起又增添了一项制度，凡科室需要干部一律张榜公开招考，择优录取。其它诸如外出进修、入学深造等，均采取同样的办法。这样一来，“条子”、“面子”就失去了市场。
    自身的清正廉明，无疑给厂领导的严格管理增添了号召力。也使他们敢于处理任何违背规章制度的人和事，绝不姑息迁就。一名工人自恃其亲属是相当一级的负责干部，来头硬，谁也不敢把他怎么样，自由散漫，公开违反厂里的有关规章制度。厂领导了解到他的情况后，态度很明朗：厂里任何人都不是特殊职工。很快对这名工人作出辞退处理的意见，张榜公布。随后，厂领导给这位负责同志挂了电话，通报了厂子的决定，请他对厂里的工作给予支持，并请他做好亲属的思想工作。吃苦在先享受在后
    如果问厂里职工，谁最辛苦？几乎可以得到大致相同的回答：厂领导。事实确实如此。
    厂党委书记李常信家在北京。自打从部队转业到厂里工作这十多年来，他基本上没有休过探亲假。即便是利用出差途经北京的间隙，回家看看，也是来去匆匆。老李只要是在厂里，工作时间就无法用8小时工作制来计算，常常是忙乎到深更半夜。可他在每年难得一次的春节休假时，遵守劳动纪律却丁是丁，卯是卯。今年春节除夕下午，他仍然在厂里坚持工作，见着的人，都劝老李早点回北京同家人团聚。他只是笑着说：“职工们还在顶班生产，我怎么能离开厂子”。待他除夕夜行单影只回到北京，别人家早已是合家团聚，围坐在电视机旁观看中央电视台的“春节联欢晚会”，享受天伦之乐了。厂里规定春节放假5天，他没等休完假，初四就返回厂里，筹划春节过后的各项工作。
    厂领导工作最辛苦，可自从恢复奖金以来，奖金始终没有高过职工的平均水平。在厂里，管理干部的奖金比其他职工低，厂领导的奖金只相当于管理干部的中等水平，每月20元左右。对这个问题，厂领导早就公开地宣布过：“厂长和书记绝不眼红工人的工资和福利高于我们。因为我们是共产党员，就是要吃苦在先，享受在后”。
