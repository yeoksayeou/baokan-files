	Youth Shines on the Loess Plateau
	— A Record of Wang Leihou and His Research Project
	By Cao Mingsheng and Nie Xin Guang

	The Joy of Harvest

	In late autumn, the earth is golden. The farmers of Sheliang Township in Hequ County have harvested a bountiful autumn despite the drought. Their young township head, Wang Leihou, has also reaped a fruitful autumn.

	On October 29, 1989, the third-floor conference room of the Xinzhou Guesthouse was hosting the Xinzhou Region Agricultural Science and Technology Achievement Appraisal Meeting. Fifteen renowned experts and professors, including Chen Jiajie, deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, showed great interest in Wang Leihou's "Research on the Development of Agricultural Ecological Economic Systems in Arid and Barren Mountainous Areas." After repeated discussions, they unanimously agreed that this research has designed a new path for the economic development of arid and barren mountainous areas. The achievement is "a pioneering example of township-level research and practice in the country," with widespread promotion value.

	Holding the appraisal certificate signed by Director Chen Jiajie, Wang Leihou was excited and speechless for a long time. For three years, he had diligently conducted research and promotion. The loess plateau, which had gradually awakened from its slumber, and the millionaires emerging from the yellow earth, had already conducted two scientific appraisals of his achievements. He had been excited and proud of this. But this time, it was the experts' appraisal, and his achievements had been officially affirmed in theory.

	Sleeping on the Kangs in Farmers' Homes

	Sheliang Township is a typical impoverished mountainous township in the Jinxi region, with countless gullies and barren hills. In early spring of 1987, Wang Leihou came to this most remote and backward township in the county. Standing on this land, looking at the yellow sky and yellow earth, with gullies crisscrossing and barren hills, Wang Leihou's brows were tightly furrowed, and his heart was heavy. Within the entire township, there were no mineral resources, no township or village enterprises, only the thin fields left by his ancestors, with an average of 5 mu per person. This year, foxtail millet, next year, sorghum... Maintaining a simple life with a simple mode of reproduction. In the past four years, the average annual income per person in the township was only 117 yuan, and the grain production was over 600 jin, slightly higher than the level of the 1950s. The rural reforms had been going on for eight or nine years, but poverty still ruled everything here.

	Like all contemporary college students, he had once dreamed in pink. But stepping out of the gates of Shanxi Agricultural University, ten years had passed. These ten years, he had been painstakingly pursuing on the land of reality, searching for his position in the coordinate system of life. He had worked in the Agricultural and Pastoral Bureau, the Technical Station, the Seed Company, the Agricultural Commission, and other units. Although he had performed excellently in his work, he always felt that his expertise was not fully utilized, and his ambitions could not be realized. This time, going to work in the countryside was the organization's decision, and it was also his own choice.

	After taking office, he neither went to compete for investments nor to run projects. Instead, he wore a pair of sports shoes and went to the villages and households for extensive investigations. By the time he had visited all the more than ten villages in the township, he had brought back two heavy notebooks, and it had been two and a half months since he had been home.

	Late at night. In the cave dwelling of the township government, Wang Leihou lay on the kang, unable to fall asleep for a long time. For many years, farmers, influenced by traditional concepts and the inertia of traditional agricultural structure, had engaged in single-crop planting, flat cultivation, extensive farming, and blind management, leading to the vicious cycle of the ecological economic system. If Sheliang Township wanted to become rich, it must take the path of developing the agricultural ecological economic system. Adjust the industrial structure reasonably, optimize the combination of production factors, and comprehensively input various modern agricultural scientific and technological innovations.

	He Sowed the Spark

	"Our township has no resources. Can we get rich by relying on the land? Yes, we can!" At the meeting of all township cadres, Wang Leihou spoke passionately, "The basic concept of the family comprehensive management model in Sheliang Township is: to give full play to the advantages of planting and breeding, focusing on potatoes and beans; to plant fruit trees in front of and behind the houses, and to actively develop chickens and rabbits. Specifically, for each household, it is 1 melon, 2 pigs, 3 sheep, 4 foxtail millet, 5 potatoes, 6 beans, 7 forests, 8 grasses, that is: covering one mu of high-quality watermelon with plastic film (interplanting yam, intercropping radish), raising 2 pigs and 3 sheep, planting 4 mu of foxtail millet and 5 mu of yam, 6 mu of beans (intercropping oilseeds), afforesting 7 mu (4 mu of fruit trees), and planting 8 mu of grass. Its characteristics are: low investment, quick results, no risk, easy to set up; it has both short-term benefits and medium- and long-term projects. Planting and breeding develop simultaneously, and agricultural and sideline products are used in multiple levels, in line with the objective laws of ecological agriculture..."

	Perhaps because of the rationality of this model, or perhaps out of trust in this agricultural university graduate, all the township cadres unanimously approved this model.

	Subsequently, the township government established the "Family Comprehensive Management Model Research Association," with Wang Leihou as the president. At that time, 32 members were developed.

	In 1987, the township government selected 3 villages and 8 households for demonstration. Wang Leihou stayed in Yangjia Village for a point of contact, living and eating with the demonstration household Zhao Jiezhi. By the end of the year, these 8 households had an average income of over 800 yuan and 1,300 jin of grain, more than twice that of ordinary households. Zhao Jiezhi's average income reached 1,074 yuan, and 1,700 jin of grain, becoming the richest person in the township overnight.

	Wang Leihou returned to the township government from Yangjia Village, based on the experimental results in his experimental field over the past year and a large amount of investigation and research, further optimized the internal structure of each industry, and formulated a scientific plan for farming and breeding. At the same time, he also established an agricultural technology promotion fund in the township government, with each villager contributing 1.5 yuan, used for the promotion of new technologies.

	In the spring of 1988, the family comprehensive management model in Sheliang Township was demonstrated and promoted in all 10 villages and 200 households, and Yangjia was established as the model village. All township cadres went to the villages to take responsibility for the villages and households, promoting and mobilizing. Wang Leihou was responsible for the model village.

	— The plastic film was brought back, but people were afraid to buy it, fearing that it would not be worth the money. He took the lead in mortgaging 980 yuan of plastic film for Yangjia Village. Following his lead, all township cadres mortgaged their salaries to sell the plastic film to the farmers on credit.

	— After much effort, he brought back a batch of "Killer No. 1" virus-free potato seeds from Heilongjiang, but the farmers did not believe in the "black lumps." He represented the township government and signed a "contract production of 2,000 jin per mu, compensation for poor harvests" with the farmers, dispelling the farmers' concerns.

	— He generously took out 170 yuan of his salary to buy high-quality watermelon seeds and pesticides for the farmers of Yangjia Village from the county seed company, and personally soaked the seeds and promoted germination for each household. He also held five training classes in the village, passing on all his knowledge to the farmers.

	The farmers were half-believing and half-doubting, betting on their township head.

	The Loess Plateau's Reward

	This was an unprecedented autumn in the history of Sheliang Township.

	Perhaps this land had been barren for too long, and the potential that had been accumulated for many years seemed to be released all at once this autumn. The crops grew vigorously and crazily.

	The "Killer No. 1" virus-free potatoes weighed 3.6 jin per tuber, with an average yield of 4,130 jin per mu. The "Fengguang No. 1" radishes weighed 22 jin each, were as thick as a thermos, and half as tall as a person...

	The farmers were astonished!

	Visitors who came to see it were amazed.

	The 200 demonstration households had fat pigs and strong sheep, lush forests, and abundant grain. The average annual grain production per person was 1,670 jin, and the pure income was 860 yuan. There were 68 households with over 10,000 jin of grain production. In that year, there were 50 households with an income of over 10,000 yuan.

	Since the implementation of the plan in 1987, through experiments and demonstrations, the industrial structure and economic structure of the entire township have gradually become reasonable, showing good ecological and social benefits, and the rural economy has undergone tremendous changes. In 1985, the average grain production per person in the entire township was 330 jin, and the average income was 56 yuan. By 1989, the average grain production per person in the entire township was 518 jin, and the average income had surged to 410 yuan.

	The enriched farmers actively repaid the loans from the credit cooperative and voluntarily handed over the purchase grain. Whenever Wang Leihou went to the village, watermelons were opened, and braised mutton was served... He was called the "living wealth god" by the farmers.

	This is the gratitude of the mountain people.

	This is the reward of the loess plateau!

    青春，在黄土高坡闪光
    ——记王磊厚和他的研究课题
    曹明生　聂新光
    收获的喜悦
    深秋十月，大地铺金。河曲县社梁乡的农民们在旱灾之年又收获了一个沉甸甸的金秋。他们的年轻乡长王磊厚也收获了一个丰盈的秋天。
    1989年10月29日，忻州宾馆三楼会议室。这里正在举行忻州地区农业科技成果鉴定会。山西省社科院副院长陈家骥等15名国家、省著名专家教授，对王磊厚的“干旱贫瘠山区农业生态经济系统开发研究”发生了浓厚的兴趣，反复论证后一致认为：这项研究为贫瘠干旱山区农业经济开发设计了一条新途径，该成果“在国内是一个乡级研究和实践的先进案例”，具有普遍推广价值。
    手捧陈家骥院长签名的鉴定书，王磊厚激动、兴奋，半晌说不出话来。3年来的苦心研究推广，那片渐已从沉睡中醒来的黄土地，那一个个从黄土地上冒出来的万元户，对他的成果已经进行了两次最科学的鉴定，他为此激动过、兴奋过。可这次是专家们的鉴定，他的成果正式在理论上得到了肯定。
    睡在农家的土炕上
    社梁乡，晋西北千沟万壑一个典型的贫困山乡。
    1987年初春，王磊厚来到了这个全县最偏僻闭塞的穷乡。站在这块土地上望着那黄的天，黄的地，沟壑纵横，荒山秃岭，王磊厚双眉紧锁，心情十分沉重。全乡范围内无任何矿产资源，没有一家乡、村办企业，只有老祖宗留下的那人均5亩薄田。今年糜子，明年谷子……以简单的再生产方式维持简单的生活。近4年内全乡平均人均收入仅117元，粮食600余斤，略高于50年代的水平。农村改革八九年了，贫穷仍然主宰着这里的一切。
    他和当代所有大学生一样，也曾做过玫瑰色的梦。可迈出山西农学院的校门，一晃10年过去了。这10年，他在现实的土地上苦苦地追求，在人生的坐标系上寻找自己的位置。他先后在农牧局、技术站、种子公司、农委等单位工作过，尽管工作干得出色，但总觉得自己的专长得不到发挥，抱负不能施展。这次到乡下工作是组织的决定，也正是他自己的选择。
    上任后，他一不去争投资，二不去跑项目，而是穿一双运动鞋，下乡逐村逐户进行广泛的调查。待他跑遍了全乡10多个大小村庄，带回两本沉甸甸的笔记，已是两个半月没有回家了。
    静夜。乡政府的窑洞里，王磊厚躺在土炕上，久久不能入睡。多少年来，农民受传统观念的影响和传统农业结构惯性的驱使，单一种植、平面垦殖、广种薄收、盲目经营导致了生态经济系统的恶性循环。社梁乡要想富，必须走农业生态经济系统开发的路子。合理调整产业结构，优化生产要素组合，综合输入各种现代农业科学新技术。
    他播下火种
    “……我们乡无任何资源，靠土地能不能致富？能！”在社梁乡全体干部会议上，王磊厚慷慨陈词，“社梁乡家庭综合经营模式的基本构想是：发挥种养优势，突出薯豆、猪羊；房前屋后栽果树，积极发展鸡和兔。具体到每一个农户为1瓜、2猪、3羊、4糜、5薯、6豆、7林、8草，即：地膜覆盖一亩优种西瓜（套种山药，间作萝卜），养2头猪、3只站羊，种4亩糜黍、5亩山药，6亩豆类（间作油料），造林7亩，（果树4亩），种草8亩。它的特点是：投资小，见效快，无风险，易设施；既有近期效益，又有中长期项目。种养同步发展，农副产品多层次利用，符合生态农业的客观规律……”
    也许是因为这个模式的合理性，也许出于对这位农大毕业生的信任，全乡干部一致通过了这个模式。
    随之，乡政府成立了“家庭综合经营模式研究会”，王磊厚任会长。当时发展会员32人。
    1987年乡政府选了3个村8户进行示范。王磊厚在杨家也村蹲点，与示范户赵继拴同吃同住。年终，这8户人均收入800余元，粮1300斤，超过一般户的二倍。赵继拴人均收入达1074元，粮1700余斤，一跃成为全乡的首富。
    王磊厚从杨家也村回到乡政府，以自己一年来试验田里的试验结果和大量的调查研究为依据，对各产业内部再进行优化组合，制定了一套科学种田养殖的方案。同时，他还在乡政府设立了农业技术推广基金，全乡村民每人拿出1.5元，用于新技术推广。
    1988年春，社梁乡家庭综合经营模式在全乡10个村200户农家进行示范推广，并确立杨家也为样板村。乡干部全部下乡包村包户，宣传发动。王磊厚包的是样板村。
    ——地膜拉回来了，人们不去买，怕花钱不顶用。他带头为杨家也村抵押了980元地膜款。在他的带动下，全乡干部纷纷用自己的工资做抵押，把地膜全部赊销给农民。
    ——几经周折，他从黑龙江调回一批“克星一号”脱毒种薯，农民却不相信那种“黑瘤瘤”。他代表乡政府和农民签了一份“亩产2000斤，歉收补足”的包产合同，解除了农民的顾虑。
    ——他慷慨拿出工资170元，到县种子公司为杨家也村农民买回优种西瓜籽、农药，并亲自为各户进行浸种，催芽，还在该村举办培训班5次，把自己的知识全部传授给农民。
    农民们半信半疑，把“赌注”押在了他们的乡长身上。
    黄土地的报答
    这是社梁乡历史上一个罕见的秋天。
    许是这片土地荒芜得太久了，多少年来蕴藏下的潜力仿佛就在这个秋天要全部释放出来。那庄稼一股劲地向上窜，一股劲地疯长。
  “克星一号”脱毒薯单粒重达3.6斤，大面积平均亩产4130斤，“丰光一代”萝卜单个重达22斤，暖壶粗，半人高……
    农民们惊呆了！
    慕名而来的参观者无不啧啧称奇。
    200个示范户家家猪肥羊壮，户户林茂粮丰。人均年产粮1670斤，纯收入860元。全乡出现产粮万斤以上的有68户。当年收入达万元的50户。
    从1987年实施规划以来，经过试验示范，全乡产业结构、经济结构逐渐趋于合理，体现出了良好的生态效益和社会效益，农村经济发生了巨大变化。1985年全乡人均粮食330公斤，人均收入56元。到1989年，全乡人均产粮518公斤，人均收入猛增到410元。
    富裕起来的农民们主动到信用社还清历年贷款，自动上交征购粮。王磊厚一到村里，西瓜打开了，炖羊肉端来了……他被称为“农民的活财神”。
    这是山里人的感激之情。
    这是黄土地的报答！
