On October 11th, a resident of Ping Shan Town's Yan Pu Village in our county, Zhang Danzi, attempted to extract diesel from a mixture of over 1 kilogram of diesel and gasoline. He ignited the mixed fuel in his courtyard to attempt the extraction. Due to the rapid combustion of the gasoline, a fire started, which ignited another nearby barrel of diesel, causing an explosion. Tragically, his mother and his 4-year-old son were killed on the spot. Zhang himself was severely injured and hospitalized, and part of his house was destroyed, resulting in economic losses amounting to over 30,000 yuan.
