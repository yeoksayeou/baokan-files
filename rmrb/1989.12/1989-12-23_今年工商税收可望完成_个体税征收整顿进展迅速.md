Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22nd.

The head of the State Taxation Administration, Jin Xin, recently stated at a meeting of national taxation bureau chiefs in Beijing that China's tax work has made significant progress in 1989, and the goal set by the State Council of exceeding the industrial and commercial tax revenue by 6 billion yuan is expected to be achieved.

Jin Xin said that 1990 is a crucial year for achieving the national rectification and rectification goals, and the tax tasks will be quite heavy, with the work being more arduous. For this reason, he demanded that the taxation departments continue to rectify the tax order and strictly enforce tax laws and regulations. The issue of unauthorized tax exemptions and reductions must be thoroughly resolved.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 21st.

The deputy head of the State Taxation Administration, Lu Renfa, today announced at a meeting of individual tax collection work in some cities across the country that the nationwide rectification of individual tax collection has made breakthrough progress. By the end of November, the country had collected 11.7 billion yuan in individual taxes, an increase of 53% over the same period last year. The total individual tax revenue for the year is expected to reach 12.5 billion yuan, with the confidence to complete the task of increasing by 30% over last year.

In July of this year, the State Council decided to launch a nationwide rectification of individual tax collection. Various places have investigated and dealt with a number of tax evaders. According to statistics from Shandong, Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces by the end of October, a total of 5,313 individual households evading or underreporting taxes amounting to more than 100,000 yuan were investigated and dealt with, including more than 140 households evading or underreporting taxes amounting to more than 1 million yuan.
