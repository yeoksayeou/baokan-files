Throughout the 1980s, Latin America experienced a prolonged economic crisis, which Latin Americans refer to as the "lost decade" or the "decade of stagnation." In the final year of this decade, despite efforts by many countries to adjust and reform, most have not escaped their predicaments. Overall, the economic situation in Latin America this year is worse than last year, primarily manifested in low economic growth rates, worsening inflation, and more severe capital outflows due to debt repayment.

In terms of economic growth, only a few countries achieved slow growth this year, while most stagnated, and some even saw negative growth. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the region's economic growth rate for 1989 is expected to be 0.2%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from last year. This marks the third consecutive year of declining growth rates. From 1981 to 1989, the region's cumulative economic growth rate was 11%, but per capita output decreased by 9.4%, as population growth outpaced economic growth. The Inter-American Development Bank's annual report on the economic situation in Latin America for 1989 also presents similar figures and views, noting that due to reduced new funding and investment, declining international reserves, persistent high unemployment, and worsening inflation in some countries, the Latin American economy is in chaos and is expected to continue this "negative trend" next year.

Inflation is a prominent issue facing Latin American countries this year. Last year, the region's inflation rate reached 470.8%, breaking historical records, and this year it has continued to rise. By the third quarter, the cumulative inflation index in Latin American countries was generally in the double digits, with some major economies exceeding three digits. Brazil, which accounts for about one-third of the region's GDP, saw its cumulative inflation index for the year potentially reach 1300% after the failure of its "Summer Plan" at the beginning of the year, far exceeding last year's levels. Argentina's situation is also dire, with a 200% inflation rate in July alone. Other countries such as Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Nicaragua are also severely affected by inflation, with inflation rates in the first half of the year increasing three to four times compared to the same period last year.

Hyperinflation has led to stagnant investment, economic contraction, increased unemployment, supply shortages, soaring prices, currency devaluation, and a significant decline in workers' real income and purchasing power. This has repeatedly led to public protests and strikes, and even looting and riots, causing social unrest. Countries in Central America that are in conflict have seen their economies severely damaged, making the situation even more dire.

This year, a few Latin American countries have seen relatively stable economic situations, such as Colombia, Mexico, and Chile. These countries have made adjustments and reforms that suit their national conditions in recent years, leading to some economic recovery and growth, with annual inflation rates controlled within double digits. However, they are still affected to varying degrees by debt repayment pressures, worsening trade conditions, capital outflows, or internal turmoil, hindering their development. 1989 was an election year for Latin America, and newly elected governments have generally implemented economic adjustment policies, taking measures such as reforming the production structure, expanding product exports, tightening public spending, and curbing inflation to address the current difficulties. Experts believe that whether the Latin American economy can improve depends largely on external factors, with solving the debt problem being key, as the heavy debt burden not only severely hinders the region's economic development but has also evolved into a political issue.

Latin America is the epicenter of the global debt crisis, with 12 of the 17 most indebted countries in the Third World being in Latin America. Statistics show that since 1979, Latin American countries have repaid a cumulative $280 billion in external debt, but their debt has increased from $190 billion at that time to the current $410 billion, accounting for one-third of the Third World's total external debt. In 1989, due to rising interest rates, Latin American countries will pay $35 billion in debt interest, the highest amount of capital outflow since the debt crisis in 1982. To repay debts, the region's trade surplus will again be completely offset this year. On the other hand, Western creditor banks not only refuse to reduce interest and principal amounts but also refuse to provide new loans to debtor countries. Western enterprises are also continuously withdrawing costs and reducing investments in Latin America, turning the region into a pure capital outflow area.

The trend of increasing debt, difficulty in raising funds, and worsening development conditions has made Latin American countries realize that without solving the debt problem and improving external conditions, economic growth is out of the question. Therefore, easing the debt crisis is an urgent task to improve the economic situation in Latin America, and the direction of Latin American debt in the new year will continue to be a focus of global attention.

### 拉美经济形势更加恶化

    拉美经济形势更加恶化
    本报记者　兰才基
    整个80年代，拉美地区经历了一场旷日持久的经济危机，拉美人称为“失去的10年”或“衰退的10年”。在这个年代的最后一年，尽管许多国家在调整和改革方面作出了新的努力，但大多数国家仍然没有摆脱困境。总的来说，今年拉美经济形势比去年更加恶化，主要表现是：经济增长率低下，通货膨胀加剧，因支付外债而使资金外流更加严重。
    从经济增长速度看，今年只有少数国家获得缓慢增长，多数处于停滞状态，还有一些国家出现负增长。据联合国拉美经济委员会提供的统计材料，1989年拉美地区经济的年增长率将是0.2％，比去年又降低了3个百分点，这是连续3年经济增长率下降。自1981年至1989年，该地区经济增长率累计为11％，但人均产值下降了9.4％，这是因为人口增长速度超过了经济增长速度。泛美开发银行发表的拉美地区1989年经济形势年度报告也提出了类似的数字和看法，认为今年由于新的资金来源和投资大幅度减少，国际储备下降，持续的高失业率和一些国家通货膨胀加剧，拉美经济出现了混乱，并认为明年还将继续这种“消极形势”。
    通货膨胀加剧，是今年拉美国家普遍遇到的一个突出问题。去年该地区通膨率高达470.8％，已突破历史最高纪录，而今年则更是有增无已。到第三季度为止，拉美各国通膨累计指数普遍在两位数以上，一些经济大国已经突破了3位数。国内生产总值约占全地区1／3的巴西，在年初推行“夏令计划”失败以后，通货膨胀全年累计指数可能达1300％，大大超过去年水平。阿根廷形势也很严峻，仅7月份一个月就达200％。其它不少国家如秘鲁、委内瑞拉、巴拉圭、尼加拉瓜等也同样受通膨严重困扰，仅上半年通膨率就比去年同期增加3倍至4倍。
    恶性通货膨胀使这些国家投资不振，经济萎缩，失业人数增加，供应短缺，物价飞涨，货币贬值，职工实际收入和购买力明显下降，由此不断引起群众示威和罢工，甚至发生哄抢商店以致流血骚乱事件，社会动乱不已。处于战乱中的一些中美洲国家，经济普遍遭受严重破坏，形势更加严峻。
    今年以来，也有一些拉美国家经济形势相对比较平稳，如哥伦比亚、墨西哥和智利。这些国家近些年作出了比较符合国情的调整与改革，经济有一定的恢复和回升，年通膨率可以控制在两位数以内。但是，它们仍然在不同程度上受到偿债压力、外贸条件恶化、资金外流或内部局势动乱之苦，发展受到很大阻碍。1989年是拉美地区的大选年，新近换届的政府普遍推行经济调整政策，采取改革生产结构、扩大产品出口、紧缩公共开支和抑制通货膨胀等各项措施，以求克服当前面临的困难形势。专家们认为，拉美经济形势能否得到改善，在很大程度上取决于外部因素，而解决债务问题是其中的关键，因为债务负担过重不仅严重地阻碍着拉美经济的发展，而且已经演变为政治性问题。
    拉美是世界债务危机的“重灾区”，第三世界17个负债最多的国家中，有12个是拉美国家。据统计，自1979年以来拉美各国偿还的外债累计达2800亿美元，但欠债却从当年的1900亿美元增至目前的4100亿美元，占第三世界外债总额的1／3。1989年由于债务利率增高，拉美国家为支付巨额债息，外流资金将达350亿美元，是1982年发生债务危机以来资金外流最高的年份。为了偿债，今年该地区外贸盈余将再次被全部抵消。另一方面，西方债权银行不仅拒绝减少利息和本金的数额，而且还拒绝向债务国提供新的借贷，西方企业还同时在拉美不断抽回成本和减少投资，使拉美地区成为纯资本输出区。
    债务越来越多、资金筹集越来越困难和发展条件越来越恶化的趋势，使拉美国家感到，如不解决债务问题，改善外部条件，那就根本谈不上经济增长。因此，缓和债务危机是改善拉美经济形势的当务之急，在新的一年里，拉美债务形势的走向仍将为世人所关注。
