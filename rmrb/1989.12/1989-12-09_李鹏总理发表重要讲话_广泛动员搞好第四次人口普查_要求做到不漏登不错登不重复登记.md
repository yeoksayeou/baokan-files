Premier Li Peng today pointed out that the fourth national census, to be conducted on July 1st next year, is essential for achieving our socio-economic development goals and for the current efforts to rectify the economic environment and order. To this end, he emphasized the need to fully leverage the advantages of the socialist system, mobilize societal forces, and ensure the success of this national survey of conditions and capabilities.

Li Peng made these remarks at the opening of the Fourth National Census Work Conference today. He said, "In formulating our national economic and social development plans, in making policies on population, education, employment, and in coordinating the material and cultural lives of the people, and in achieving the strategic goals of socialist modernization, we must rely on accurate population data. Our country has successfully conducted three national censuses, particularly the third one in 1982, which provided many important population statistics that have played a significant role in our national economic construction and social development."

Li Peng noted that over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's population situation has undergone significant changes. First, we have made some progress in controlling the population size, transitioning from uncontrolled to controlled growth, and from rapid to relatively stable growth. Since the 1970s, China has implemented family planning, and especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the state has summarized the historical experiences and lessons of the past, making family planning a fundamental national policy. We have emphasized the policy of one child per couple, which has helped control the population growth. However, due to the large population base, the cyclical impact of the birth peak, and some regions relaxing their efforts, China's total population is still increasing by 15 to 17 million per year. Achieving the goal of controlling the population to around 1.25 billion by the year 2000 is a daunting task that requires stringent measures. Secondly, in recent years, with the deepening of economic reforms and opening up, China's population distribution and composition have also changed significantly. Urban populations have grown rapidly, agricultural populations are accelerating their transition to non-agricultural sectors, population migration and mobility have increased, and there have been notable changes in population education levels, employment structure, and ethnic composition. To understand the current population situation in China, conducting the fourth national census is essential.

Li Peng stated that conducting a census in a country with 1.1 billion people is unprecedented in scale and scope. He described the census as the largest social mobilization during the period of economic construction, requiring all levels of government to strengthen their leadership of the census work, prioritize it on their agendas, and ensure accurate, complete, and non-duplicative registration. He emphasized the need to eliminate the practice of underreporting births and to ensure high-quality work. Li Peng also called on Communist Party members, Young Pioneers, and cadres at all levels to set an example by actively participating in the census, treating it as a glorious political task, and model the implementation of census procedures.

Li Tieming, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councilor, and head of the State Council's Fourth National Census Leading Group, delivered a work report at the meeting. He outlined the basic requirements for conducting the census, stressing the need for close coordination among relevant departments, effective propaganda and education, frugal management of census resources, and strict adherence to the planned timeline for completing each phase of the census work.

It is reported that the census will involve millions of census workers selected from party and government officials, enterprise and institution employees, retired cadres, and grassroots rural officials.

Today's meeting was presided over by Liu Zhongde, Vice Secretary-General of the State Council and Deputy Head of the State Council's Fourth National Census Leading Group. Over 300 leaders and relevant personnel from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government attended the meeting.

    李鹏总理发表重要讲话
    广泛动员搞好第四次人口普查
    要求做到不漏登不错登不重复登记
    新华社北京十二月八日电　（记者于长洪）国务院总理李鹏今天指出，将于明年七月一日进行的第四次全国人口普查是实现社会经济发展战略目标和当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的需要。为此，他强调要充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，广泛动员社会力量，搞好这次国情国力调查。
    李鹏在今天开幕的第四次全国人口普查工作会议上作了重要讲话。他说，我们制定国民经济和社会发展计划，制定人口、教育、就业等政策，统筹安排人民的物质和文化生活，实现社会主义现代化经济建设的战略目标，都要以人口情况为重要依据。我国已经成功地进行过三次人口普查，尤其是一九八二年第三次全国人口普查，取得了许多重要的人口资料，在国家的经济建设和社会发展中发挥了重大作用。
    李鹏说，建国四十年来，我国的人口状况发生了很大变化。首先在人口数量控制上取得了一定的成效，人口从无控制转变为有控制，从高速增长转变为较平稳地增长。七十年代以来，我国实行了人口计划生育，尤其是党的十一届三中全会以后，国家总结了建国以来的历史经验和教训，把人口计划生育定为一项基本国策，注意制定和完善有关人口的方针、政策，提倡一对夫妇只生育一个孩子，人口数量得到进一步控制。但是，由于我国人口基数大，加上人口生育高峰的周期性影响和有些地区工作有所放松等原因，目前我国总人口每年仍以一千五百万—一千七百万的数量增长着，实现二○○○年人口控制在十二亿五千万左右的任务十分艰巨，必须采取有力措施，进行严格控制。其次，近些年来随着经济改革、开放的深入，我国人口的分布和构成状况也发生了很大变化。城镇人口有很大发展，农业人口加速向非农业人口转移，人口迁移流动量增加，人口的文化素质、就业构成、民族构成等都有不少变化。为了查清我国的人口现状，进行第四次全国人口普查是十分必要的。
    李鹏说，在拥有十一亿人口的大国中进行人口普查，规模之大，涉及面之广，在我国历史上是空前的。他称人口普查是经济建设时期最大的一种社会动员，要求各级人民政府加强对人口普查工作的领导，把人口普查列入重要议事日程，做到不漏登、不错登、不重复登记，切实消除瞒报出生人口的现象，确保工作的高质量。李鹏还要求共产党员、共青团员、各级干部要以身作则，把积极参加人口普查作为一项光荣的政治任务，模范地执行人口普查办法。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务委员、国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组组长李铁映在今天的会上作了工作报告。他提出了做好普查工作的基本要求，强调各有关部门密切配合，做好宣传教育工作，勤俭办普查，严格按计划规定的时间完成人口普查各个环节上的每一项工作。
    据介绍，这次人口普查的几百万普查人员将从党政机关干部、企事业单位职工、离退休干部和农村基层干部中选调。
    今天的会议由国务院副秘书长、国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组副组长刘忠德主持。各省、自治区、直辖市负责人口普查的领导及有关人员三百多人出席了会议。
