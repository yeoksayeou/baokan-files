In a situation where the market is generally sluggish, the Mudanjiang Department Store in Heilongjiang Province has completed its commercial goods sales volume, tax payments, and after-tax profits for the first 10 months of this year, which are close to and exceed the full-year levels of 1988.

To prevent sales slumps, the Mudanjiang Department Store has adopted four business strategies: First, it has divided the 13 subordinate stores into 19, implementing specialized sales in each store, further expanding the variety and increasing the colors, achieving a situation where "if you don't have it, I do." Second, it has strictly controlled the quality of goods entering the store, preventing fake and substandard products. This year, the city conducted three inspections and found no fake or substandard goods. Third, it has adjusted the product structure, reducing the number of high-end, slow-moving branded goods, expanding the range of small commodities, increasing medium and low-end goods, and promoting popular items, aiming to be comprehensive and innovative. Fourth, it has adopted various business methods such as joint sales, agency sales, promotional sales, production-sales, and trial sales, helping factories with backlogged products and increasing the store's sales profits.

This store also focuses on providing quality service, implementing the "short-term plan," frequently adjusting sales and profit targets, and promptly fulfilling responsibilities and benefits, thereby enhancing the enthusiasm of all employees. To ensure customer satisfaction, they have expanded the "nine trials and one exchange" policy to cover over 85% of products. At the same time, they have expanded the range of free home delivery items. In the first nine months alone, they exchanged or returned goods worth 190,000 yuan and over 10,000 items. They have also strengthened home repair services.

They have observed that although the market has become sluggish, there are still many best-selling and stable-selling products. Even slow-moving products are not completely unsellable. Therefore, they emphasize the use of business techniques and improving business skills. For the current key slow-moving high-end home appliances, they use the strategy of "brand plus discount" to attract customers. Since August, they have purchased over 300 brand-name refrigerators, which were sold out within a week; they have also purchased over 1,800 brand-name color TVs, of which more than 60% have been sold. Daily small commodities have always been stable sellers. They have expanded the business area, increasing the sales of small hardware, small daily necessities, small general merchandise, and small knitwear by over 2,100 varieties, attracting a wide range of customers with their comprehensive product offerings.

    靠经营策略　靠优质服务　靠销售技巧
    牡丹江百货大楼购销两旺
    头十月销售额和利税达去年全年水平
    本报讯　在市场普遍疲软的情况下，黑龙江省牡丹江百货大楼今年头10个月完成的商品销售额、上缴税金和税后利润，分别接近和超过1988年全年水平。
    牡丹江百货大楼为了预防销售滑坡，采取了四项经营策略：一，划小二级核算单位，将下属13个商场划为19个，实行商场专卖，进一步扩大品种，增加花色，做到你无我有。二，把住进货质量关，严防假冒伪劣。今年市里三次检查，没发现一件假冒、伪劣商品。三，调整商品结构，减少杂牌滞销高档商品，扩大小商品经营，增加中低档商品，增销大路货，并以求全求新取胜。四，采取联销、代销、推销、产销、试销等多头经营方式，一来为积压产品的厂家解难，二来为商店增加销售利润。
    这家商店还着重抓优质服务，推行“小段计划”，对销售和盈利指标短安排、勤验收，“责利”勤兑现，增强全店职工积极性。为了让顾客放心、满意，他们将试穿、试戴、试用等“九试一退换”品种扩大到85％以上。同时，扩大免费送货上门的商品品种。仅头9个月，就退换价值19万元、1万多件商品。加强了上门维修服务。
    他们看到，市场虽然疲软下来，但从商品销势来看，仍然有大量畅销和稳销商品，即使滞销商品，并不是一点也卖不动。对此，他们强调施展经营技巧，提高经营艺术。对当前重点滞销的高档家电商品，用“名优加让利”的对策来吸引顾客。进入8月份以来，购进300多台名牌冰箱，一周之内一销而光；购进名牌彩电1800多台，已销出60％以上。日用小商品历来都是稳销货。他们通过扩大营业面积，增销小五金、小日杂、小百货、小针织等2100多个品种，以货全吸引了广大顾客。　（张焕铭　沈树理）
