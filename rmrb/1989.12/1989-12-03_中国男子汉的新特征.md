With the deepening and development of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, the outdated customs left over from feudal society have significantly changed for Chinese men. If you pay a little attention to life, you can discover many precious new characteristics in men:

	They willingly enter the kitchen. Most men, especially those in urban areas, willingly share the kitchen with their wives. Many men even enjoy competing with their wives in cooking, finding it a great pleasure in life.

	They have a connection with the washboard. In the past, men washing clothes or diapers would be a laughing matter among their peers. Now, however, they consider washing clothes to be a sign of diligence and a duty.

	They know how to be thrifty. They live frugally in their daily lives, and just look at the marketplaces, where about 70% of the customers are men. They are very much like the housewives of the past, carrying baskets and bargaining with vendors over every ounce and cent.

	They have learned to understand and yield. They treat their wives as equals at home, and most can listen to their wives' criticisms and advice. The phenomenon of male dominance has become less common.

	They have more love for their children. With the increase in only children, more fathers are particularly fond of their children, actively playing and befriending them, changing the abnormal mindset that "children only recognize their mothers."

	They have mastered the skills of motherhood. Morning tasks like dressing, washing the face, and combing the hair of their children, as well as evening tasks like bathing them, are things that most fathers can also do. These are no longer solely the mother's domain.

	They have the "daughter's heart" that parents love. Most men respect their parents and take care of the elderly, communicating heart to heart with them. This is what all parents need most.

	Sewing and tailoring are no longer rare. With the development of sewing machines, many men have emerged as tailors and sewing experts. Sewing is no longer the exclusive domain of women.

	More men can be smoke-free. Not smoking is a great virtue of women, and the smoking rate among modern men has significantly decreased. According to a partial survey conducted by the author, the smoking rate among men has decreased by 12% compared to ten years ago.

    中国男子汉的新特征
    随着社会主义精神文明建设的深入和发展，封建社会遗留给中国男子们的陈规陋俗有了很大程度的改变。诸君若对生活稍加留心，即可从男子们身上发现种种可贵的新特征：
    自觉地走进了厨房　大多数男子，尤其是城镇男子，能自觉地与妻子“争灶台”，不少男子还把在做菜上与妻子“比手艺”，当作一大生活乐趣。
    与搓衣板有了缘份　前些年，男同志搓衣服、洗尿布，会成为同性们的笑料。可他们现在却认为洗衣服是勤快，是一种义务。
    知道怎样勤俭持家　他们平时勤俭过日子就甭说，单看集贸市场上70％左右的顾客就是男性，他们很像过去的家庭妇女，提着菜篮与商贩们计斤两、争分文。
    学会了理解和谦让　他们在家里与妻子的地位平等化，大多数能听取妻子的批评和规劝，过去那种唯我独尊的男子霸道现象少见了。
    多了对孩子的爱心　随着独生子女的增加，更多的爸爸格外疼爱孩子，能主动与孩子做游戏、交朋友，改变了“孩子只认娘”的畸形心理状态。
    练就了“做娘”的本领　早晨给孩子穿衣、洗脸、梳头，晚上给孩子洗澡等琐事，多数父亲同样会做，再也不单属母亲一个人的“份内活”了。
    父母喜欢的“女儿心”多数男同志能尊敬父母，照顾老人，与父母心心相通。这是天下父母们最需要的“女儿心”。
    裁剪缝纫不为稀奇　随着缝纫机的发展，男子中涌现出不少的裁剪师和缝纫能手，针线活再也不属于女同志的“专利权”了。
    更多的能与烟绝缘　不吸烟是女性的一大美德，而现代的男子抽烟率大大下降，据笔者进行的局部调查表明，男子抽烟率比十年前下降12％。              （1989年第11期《湖北青年》王合意文）
