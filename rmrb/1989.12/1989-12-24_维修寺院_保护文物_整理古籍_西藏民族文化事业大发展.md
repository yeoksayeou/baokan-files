Recently, the central government decided to allocate 35 million yuan specifically for the repair of the Potala Palace, and the repair work has already begun. Currently, there are 24 key cultural relic protection units in the entire region, with over 1,400 temples and religious activity sites, and more than 30,000 monks and nuns engaged in normal religious activities, meeting the religious needs of the broad masses of the people.
