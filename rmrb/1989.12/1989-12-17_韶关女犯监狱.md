Shaoguan in Guangdong Province has a prison that houses female criminals from all over the province, as well as a number of male criminals. Among the female inmates, 70% are under the age of 35, with the oldest being 67 years old. These female criminals are primarily convicted of theft, fraud, robbery, murder, and drug trafficking. Female criminals from Hong Kong and Macau are mostly involved in smuggling and fraud.

The moral and cultural levels of the female inmates are generally low. The prison has approximately 400 illiterate inmates, with more than 60% being female. There are nearly 340 inmates with at least a junior high school education, but only about 30 of them are female. Many of the female inmates are inherently vicious. In one unit with over 260 female inmates, 30% are convicted murderers. These women frequently shout and scream, or suddenly burst into tears, threatening to take their own lives. Managing these female inmates is quite challenging.

The prison implements compulsory labor and education for these inmates, establishing over 10 factories for weaving, clothing, casting, machine tools, brewing, automobile repair, and more. This allows the inmates to create material wealth while also learning a skill. Most female inmates are assigned to work in clothing and textile factories.

All inmates are required to study both culture and technical skills. The prison offers literacy classes, primary school classes, junior high school classes, and vocational training in tailoring, food processing, construction, home appliances, medical basics, and more. Their educational credentials are recognized by the state. The enrollment rate for inmates is 98.9%, the attendance rate is 98%, and the pass rate is 73%.

Inmates are required to wear prison uniforms. Female inmates wear blue uniforms resembling sportswear, with two wide white stripes on the sleeves and legs. They can also wear their own clothes, but these must be marked with a white square stamp. Based on their work performance, some inmates can earn bonuses, with the highest annual bonus being 400 yuan. The prison publicly discloses inmates' rations, production value, and bonuses. There is a "complaint box" in the prison, and inmates can file complaints if they are mistreated by prison staff. Inmates also publish a monthly mimeographed newsletter, *Shaoguan Li Xin Bao*, to exchange ideas within the prison. The education and reform of female inmates are primarily carried out by female prison guards.

This year, the prison implemented a quarterly comprehensive evaluation of inmates to determine their eligibility for sentence reduction. The specific method is to score inmates daily on their studies, labor, and discipline. Good behavior earns points, while poor behavior deducts points. With a base score of 100, inmates who accumulate 180 points in a quarter can be considered for sentence reduction. Therefore, many female inmates are striving for sentence reduction. Some inmates on death row with a two-year reprieve have had their sentences commuted to 20 years; others have had their sentences reduced by two years and have already had their sentences reduced twice.

### 韶关女犯监狱

    韶关女犯监狱
    广东韶关有一个关押全省女犯的监狱，也关押着不少男犯。女犯中年龄在35岁以下的占70％，最大的67岁。这些女犯主要犯盗窃、诈骗、抢劫、杀人、贩毒等罪。来自港澳的女犯则以走私和诈骗者居多。
    女囚们道德和文化水平普遍低下。整个监狱的文盲囚犯约400人，其中女囚占60％以上。初中以上的囚犯近340人，其中女囚只30多人。女囚不少人凶狠成性。有一个队260多女囚，30％是杀人犯。这些人动辄喊打喊杀，或突然嚎啕大哭，要自寻短见。对这些女囚进行管教很不容易。
    监狱对这些囚犯实施强制性的劳动和教育，设有织布、服装、铸造、机床、制酒、汽车维修等10多个工厂，让犯人除创造物质财富外，也能学到一技之长。女囚们大部分被安排在服装厂和纺织厂劳动。
    犯人在监狱中一律要学文化、学技术。监狱开设了扫盲班、小学班、初中班和剪裁、食品、建筑、家电、医学基础等10多个专业技术培训班，他们的学历得到国家承认。犯人的入学率达98.9％，到课率达98％，及格率为73％。
    犯人一律穿囚服。女犯的囚服像运动装，全蓝色，衣袖、裤腿各有两道阔边的长白带。平时也可穿自己带来的衣服，但都要盖上一道白色的四方印。根据劳动表现，有的犯人还可得到奖金，最多的一人全年可得400元。监狱对犯人的伙食、生产总值、奖金等一律公开。狱中设有“投诉箱”，管教干部若有打骂犯人的，犯人可以投诉。犯人自己还办了一份油印月刊《韶关立新报》，在监狱内交流。对女囚的教育、改造，主要靠狱中的女管教员实施。
    今年，监狱实行每季度对犯人进行一次总考核，以确定其是否减刑。具体做法是：每天对犯人的学习、劳动、纪律计分，表现好的加分，表现不好的扣分。以100分为基数，若本季积分达到180分，即可列入减刑之列。因此，不少女囚都在争取减刑。有的死缓已改判有期徒刑20年；有的一次减刑2年，并已连续两次减刑。
