It was already 9 PM, but the exhibition hall of the Thai Ministry of Commerce's Export Promotion Bureau was still brightly lit and bustling with people. The "National Products Exhibition" was in full swing.

Following the crowd, the reporter entered the exhibition hall. The display racks were filled with a variety of products, ranging from toys, jewelry, gold and silver accessories, ready-made clothing, leather goods, building materials, furniture, household appliances, small machinery, parts, and three-wheeled motor vehicles, to name a few. The designs were elegant and novel.

An official from the Ministry of Commerce's Export Promotion Bureau, Ms. Pongsa, told me that in recent years, the government has held similar exhibitions annually. This is the fifth one and the largest. Two large exhibition halls were not enough, so three temporary halls were set up outside to accommodate nearly 200 companies and production units. She went on to say that the purpose of holding the National Products Exhibition is to promote, encourage, and advocate for the purchase of domestic products, to correct the misconception that foreign goods are always better than domestic ones. In fact, with the development of Thailand's industry, the quality of many domestic products has reached world standards. The large-scale export of Thai products to developed countries is the best proof. However, people often do not realize this. Many Thais travel to Europe and America and spend high prices to buy large quantities of goods, only to find out that many of them are originally Thai products. Of course, this is also related to Thailand's past focus on exports while neglecting the domestic market. For example, some products are only for export and not for domestic sales, resulting in many people not knowing that such products can be produced domestically. The government realized that this situation would not only make domestic consumers seek foreign goods but, more importantly, would cause a loss of foreign exchange. Therefore, the government changed its previous approach and now requires the Export Promotion Bureau to work on both foreign and domestic markets. This National Products Exhibition is the implementation of the new policy. The exhibition specially organized production units that were previously only for export to participate, opening the eyes of many people.

The reporter saw many customers carrying boxes out of a booth and squeezed over. It turned out to be the Thai Thana Electric Company selling household appliances. The company's sales manager, Mr. Pathana, was introducing the products to the customers. Thana televisions, VCRs, and audio equipment are not inferior in quality to foreign products, but the prices are much lower than imported goods. Thana Company has established a service network nationwide, providing free warranties, sufficient spare parts, and convenient repairs. He casually turned on a TV and said, "This is our latest product..." I asked him about the sales volume. He said that in just one day, 20 units of 14-inch color TVs, 10 VCRs, and more than 20 tape recorders and audio equipment were sold. Many customers also placed orders. In front of Thana Company, several other electronics companies were selling refrigerators, air conditioners, and sewing machines. According to them, the sales volume was also considerable. Ms. Pongsa said, "This shows that as long as we pay attention to publicity and guidance, people still prefer domestic products."

The reporter also learned that to encourage the purchase of domestic products, the government, in addition to using similar activities for guidance, has taken other necessary measures, including increasing import taxes on imported products, especially luxury goods. For example, the price of imported foreign cosmetics is three times that of domestic products. Again, the government increased the import tax on small cars, encouraging people to use domestically produced and assembled cars (currently, Thailand cannot independently produce cars and mainly cooperates with Japan to produce and assemble cars). In Bangkok, most of the cars on the streets are Japanese brands, but they are not originally imported but locally produced and assembled. To achieve the above goals, the government, while increasing the import tax on original foreign cars, reduced the import tax on automobile parts. This not only saves a large amount of foreign exchange but also promotes the development of the domestic automobile industry. In addition to the above measures, the government has also focused on improving product technology and quality to ensure the credibility of domestic products. The government, on the one hand, promotes domestic production technology exchange and product quality competitions; on the other hand, continues to encourage domestic producers to cooperate with foreign entrepreneurs, introduce foreign technology, and strive for world-class standards.

As the reporter was leaving the exhibition, he was inspired and happily bought a few Thai products. (Accompanying photo)

    走访泰国国货展销会
    本报记者　刘爱成
    已是晚上9点了，泰国商业部出口促进厅的展览馆里依然灯火通明，人流如织。这里正在举行“国货展销会”。
    记者随着人群，走进展厅。看到陈列架上的展品种类繁多，从玩具、珠宝、金银首饰、成衣、皮革到建筑材料、家具、家用电器、小型机械、零件和三轮机动车等，应有尽有，样式美观新颖。
    商业部出口促进厅官员蓬莎女士告诉我，近年来，政府每年都举行类似的展销会，这是第五次，也是最大的一次。两个大展厅已摆不下，只好在厅外又临时搭起了3个展厅，以满足近200家公司和生产单位的需要。她接着介绍说，举办国货展销会是为了宣传、鼓励和提倡国民购买国货，扭转人们的错误意识——外国的东西总比本国的好。其实，随着泰国工业的发展，许多本国产品质量早已达到世界水准，泰国产品的大量出口，打入发达国家市场便是最好的证明。可是，人们往往还没有意识到。许多泰国人去欧美旅行，不惜高价，购买大量商品，回来后发现有许多原来是泰国产品。当然，这与泰国过去只重视出口，而忽略国内市场也有关系。比如，有些产品只出口，不内销，结果很多人不知道国内已能生产这类产品。政府意识到这样下去，不仅会使国内消费者舍近求远，更重要的是造成外汇流失。因此改变了过去的做法，现在要求出口促进厅双管齐下，不仅要抓国外市场，也要抓国内市场。这次国货展销会便是新政策的落实。展销会上，特意组织了过去仅供出口的生产单位参加。使人们大开眼界。
    记者看到许多顾客正一箱一箱地从一家柜台向外搬东西，便挤了过去。原来这是泰国他宁电器公司在展销家用电器。该公司销售经理帕他那先生正在向顾客们介绍产品。他宁电视机、录相机及音响设备等在质量上并不比外国产品差，可是价格却比进口货要便宜得多。他宁公司在全国各地建立了服务网，提供免费保修，零配件充足，修理方便。他随手打开一台电视机说，
  “这是我们最新产品……”。我问他销售量如何。他说仅今天一天，销售的14英寸彩电20台，录相机10台，收录机和音响20多台。还有许多顾客签了订单。在他宁公司对面的几家电器公司，展销的有电冰箱、空调机、电脑缝纫机等。据他们介绍，销售量也相当可观。蓬莎女士说，“这表明只要我们注意宣传引导，人们还是喜欢国货的。”
    记者还了解到，为了让国民购买国货，政府除了利用类似活动进行引导外，还采取了其他必要措施，包括提高对进口产品，尤其是奢侈品的进口税。如：进口的外国化妆品价格是本国产品价格的3倍。又如，政府提高小汽车的进口税，使人们尽量用国内生产组装的汽车。（目前泰国还不能独立生产汽车，主要与日本合作生产组装汽车）。在曼谷，街上行驶的多为日本牌子的小汽车，但并非原装进口，而是本地生产组装的。为了达到上述目标，政府在增加原装外国汽车进口税的同时，减少了对汽车零配件的进口税。这样既节省了大量外汇，又促进了本国汽车工业的发展。除上述措施外，政府还抓了产品技术和质量的提高，以此来确保国货信誉。政府一方面抓国内生产技术交流，产品质量竞赛；另一方面，继续鼓励国内生产者与外国企业家合作，引进外国技术，向世界先进水平看齐。
    在离开展销会的时候，记者受到感染，欣然买了几样泰国产品。（附图片）
