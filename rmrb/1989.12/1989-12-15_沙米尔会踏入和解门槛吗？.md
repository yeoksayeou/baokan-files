The wheels of the Middle East peace process are rolling again, drawing global attention. Following U.S. Secretary of State Baker's proposal for direct talks between Palestine and Israel, all relevant parties have responded. The foreign ministers of Egypt, Israel, and the U.S. will meet in Washington early next year to discuss the details of promoting direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis. However, people are skeptical: will Shamir step over the threshold of reconciliation?

The international community has cautiously welcomed Baker's proposal, while Israel, although expressing willingness to accept it, has done so with conditions. Israeli Prime Minister Shamir continues to insist on not recognizing the PLO, not negotiating with the PLO, and not recognizing the state of Palestine. How can such a stubborn and inflexible Shamir possibly take a step and cross the threshold of reconciliation?

The peaceful resolution of the Middle East issue requires joint efforts from both the Palestinian and Israeli sides. As for the PLO, it has already taken crucial steps towards a political solution: last November, the PLO accepted UN Resolutions 242 and 338, recognizing Israel as a state, and opposing all forms of terrorism. These realistic policy changes have been widely welcomed by the international community, and the establishment of the state of Palestine has quickly been recognized by more than a hundred countries. Palestinian leaders have repeatedly expressed their willingness to engage in dialogue with Israel to peacefully resolve the conflict between the two sides. The Palestinian reconciliation efforts have won the praise of the international community. The situation is clear:

Palestine recognizes the existence of Israel, while Israel refuses to recognize the existence of Palestine;

Palestine is a sovereign state with the right to return to its homeland, while Israel still occupies Palestinian and Arab territories and refuses to return them;

The PLO is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, but Israel slanders it as a "terrorist organization" and refuses to engage with it. Who is right and who is wrong is self-evident.

Shamir's refusal to step over the threshold of reconciliation is driven by his own calculations. Years of expansion and aggression have brought Israel tremendous benefits. Once reconciliation is achieved, the fat meat that is almost in the mouth will have to be spat out, so he is reluctant to do so. Shamir hopes for tension and does not want reconciliation. Once the Middle East is at peace, the $3 billion annual aid from the U.S. Congress to Israel will also come to an end. In a reconciled Middle East, the U.S. will no longer regard Israel as a strategic ally, and its position will be greatly weakened. Therefore, Shamir strongly opposes the U.S. engaging in dialogue with the PLO, openly declaring: "This change is dangerous for Israel," and warning: "The U.S. must understand: on some issues, Israel's position is firm and will not yield."

Shamir's unreasonable and arrogant stance has been criticized both domestically and internationally, and he has always been in an isolated position internationally. Wise people in Israel strongly advocate: "It is unreasonable not to let us start the dialogue." Recently, Israeli Labor Party leader Peres stated that if Shamir continues to insist on his own views in the Middle East peace process, the Labor Party may withdraw from the coalition government.

Shamir, who is brandishing his sword outside the threshold of reconciliation, can only bring disaster to the Israeli people. Statistics show: to suppress the Palestinian uprising, Israel has spent $3.3 billion; the struggle of the people in the occupied territories has caused Israel a loss of $2.58 billion; Israel's production has declined, with the GDP growth rate being 5.2% in 1987 and only 1.6% in 1988. As for the casualties in the war, they are increasing day by day. The outlook is not good.

As the saying goes, "Those who understand the times are heroes." For the sake of the interests of the Israeli people, Shamir should follow the trend of the times, change his rigid stance, and step over the threshold of reconciliation as soon as possible.

### 沙米尔会踏入和解门槛吗？

    沙米尔会踏入和解门槛吗？
    秦殿杰
    中东和平进程的车轮又有新的启动，举世关注。随着美国国务卿贝克提出的巴勒斯坦、以色列直接谈判的五点计划之后，有关方面都已作出答复。埃及、以色列、美国的外长明年初将聚会华盛顿，研究推动巴—以直接对话的细节问题。但是人们怀疑，沙米尔会踏入和解的门槛吗？
    对贝克的建议，国际社会持谨慎的欢迎态度，而以色列虽然表示愿意接受，但却是有条件的。以色列总理沙米尔仍然坚持不承认巴解组织、不同巴解组织谈判、不承认巴勒斯坦国的立场。如此顽固、僵硬的沙米尔，怎么可能迈出步子，踏入和解的门槛呢？
    中东问题的和平解决要靠巴、以对立双方的共同努力。作为巴解组织一方为推动政治解决已经迈出关键性的步伐：去年十一月巴解组织接受了联合国二百四十二号、三百三十八号决议，承认以色列作为一个国家存在，反对一切形式的恐怖主义。这些现实主义的政策改变受到国际社会的普遍欢迎，因此巴勒斯坦国的成立很快得到了一百多个国家的承认。巴勒斯坦领导人一再表示愿同以色列对话，和平解决双方的冲突。巴勒斯坦的和解行动赢得国际社会的赞誉。事情就是这样明摆着的：
    巴勒斯坦承认以色列的存在，而以色列拒绝承认巴勒斯坦的存在；
    巴勒斯坦是一个主权国家，有权返回自己的家园，而以色列至今仍占领巴勒斯坦、阿拉伯的领土，拒不归还；
    巴解组织是巴人民唯一合法代表，以色列却诬蔑它是“恐怖组织”，不与其打交道。谁是谁非，不言自明。
  沙米尔之所以拒绝踏进和解的门槛，是有其如意算盘的。多年的扩张、侵略，以色列捞到了莫大的实惠，一旦实现和解，到嘴的肥肉就得吐出来，因而舍不得；沙米尔希望紧张，不愿和解，一旦中东地区和平了，美国国会每年向以色列提供的三十亿美元外援也就告吹了；和解的中东，美国就不会再把以色列作为战略盟友，它的地位会大大削弱。因而，沙米尔竭力反对美国同巴解组织对话，公开叫嚷：“这种变化对以色列来说是危险的”，并告诫说：“美国必须明白：在一些问题上，以色列的立场坚定不移，决不退让。”
    沙米尔的无理、蛮横立场，遭到国内外的抨击，在国际上始终处于孤立的地位。以色列的明智人士强烈呼吁：“不让我们着手进行对话是没有道理的”。以色列工党领袖佩雷斯最近表示，如果沙米尔在中东和平进程上继续固持己见，那么工党就可能退出联合政府。
    在和解门槛外舞刀弄枪的沙米尔，只能给以色列人民带来灾难。据统计：为镇压巴人民的起义，以色列已花费了三十三亿美元；被占领土人民的斗争，使以色列受损达二十五点八亿美元；以色列生产萧条，一九八七年国民生产总值增长率为百分之五点二，而一九八八年仅为百分之一点六。至于在战火中的死伤者，更是与日俱增。前景是很不妙的。
    俗话说，识时务者为俊杰。真正有点良心，为了以色列人民的利益，沙米尔理当顺乎时代的潮流，改变僵硬的立场，尽早跨入和解的门槛。
