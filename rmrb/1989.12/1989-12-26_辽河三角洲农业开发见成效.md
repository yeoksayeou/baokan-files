    Agricultural development in the Liaohe Delta, one of the national key agricultural development zones, has shown significant results despite encountering severe drought in the first year. The development zone increased grain production by 469,000 tons and added over 100 million yuan in new production value this year.

    The Liaohe Delta is a reclaimed plain from the sea. In autumn 1988, the state approved the comprehensive development of the area starting with the Dawa and Xiaosanjiaozhou regions.

    Following the guiding principles of "unified planning, graded investment, and phased development" and "agriculture where suitable, fisheries where suitable, and livestock where suitable," the provincial, municipal, and county governments, along with farmers in the development zone, invested a total of 171 million yuan in the first year. This year, they overcame severe drought and achieved good harvests in grain, reeds, and shrimp production. The newly developed paddy fields yielded 500 kilograms per mu.

    辽河三角洲农业开发见成效
    据新华社沈阳十二月二十五日电　（记者张民华）全国重点农业开发区之一——辽河三角洲的农业综合开发，尽管第一年遇到了严重干旱，但开发区今年仍增产粮食四点六九万吨，新增产值一亿多元。
    辽河三角洲属于退海平原，一九八八年秋经国家批准，以大洼小三角洲为起步区进行综合开发。
    根据“统一规划、分级投入、逐步开发”和“宜农则农、宜渔则渔、宜牧则牧”的指导方针，省、市、县三级财政和开发区农民，第一年共投资一点七一亿元。今年，他们战胜严重干旱，粮、苇、虾等项生产都获得了较好收成。新开发的水田亩产达到五百公斤。
