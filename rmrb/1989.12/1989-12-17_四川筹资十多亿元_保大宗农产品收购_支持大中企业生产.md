    Sichuan Raises Over 10 Billion Yuan to Ensure Purchase of Major Agricultural Products and Support Production of Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises

    CHENGDU, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have studied the urgent problems in the current economic life and taken active measures to mobilize over 10 billion yuan from various channels to promote the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the provincial economy. To this end, the province has organized seven working groups to visit 13 prefecture-level cities, including Yibin and Suining, to provide specific assistance in overcoming difficulties.

    After rectification and adjustment, Sichuan's excessively high industrial growth rate has been brought down, fixed asset investment has been controlled, and price increases have been curbed. The overall economic situation is good. However, due to shortages of funds and raw materials, problems have arisen such as sluggish purchases of agricultural and sideline products, market stagnation for certain commodities, insufficient operation of some industrial enterprises, and a sharp decline in industrial growth.

    To address these issues, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government convened relevant departments to study countermeasures and, through various means of tapping potential, raised over 10 billion yuan. This limited amount of funds will be mainly used for: first, continuing to ensure the purchase of major agricultural products such as grain to avoid issuing "blank checks" as much as possible; second, supporting large and medium-sized enterprises in preparing materials for production next year; third, injecting funds into small enterprises that produce marketable and necessary goods for people's lives but are facing production halts or semi-halts due to "triangular debts" or lack of raw materials, to help them resume production.

    四川筹资十多亿元
    保大宗农产品收购
    支持大中企业生产
    本报成都12月16日电　记者罗茂城报道：日前，四川省委、省政府研究了当前经济生活中暂时出现的紧迫问题，积极采取措施，多方筹措资金10多亿元，以促进全省经济持续、稳定、协调发展。为此，省上组织7个工作组分赴宜宾、遂宁、涪陵等13个地市，具体帮助渡过难关。
    经过治理整顿，四川省过高的工业速度已降了下来，固定资产投资有所控制，抑制物价初见成效，整个经济形势是好的。但是，由于资金、原材料短缺等原因，也出现了农副产品收购不畅，某些商品市场疲软，部分工业企业开工不足，工业速度回落过猛等问题。
    为了解决这些问题，省委、省政府召集有关部门研究对策，通过多方挖掘潜力，筹集10多亿元资金。这笔有限资金主要用于：一是继续保粮食等大宗农产品收购，尽可能不打“白条”；二是支持大中企业为明年生产准备物资；三是对市场适销对路、人民生活必需而因“三角债”拖欠或缺原材料造成停产半停产小企业，适当注入资金，帮助恢复生产。
