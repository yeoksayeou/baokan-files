Li Peng, at the closing of the National Supervision Work Conference today, emphasized that strengthening anti-corruption efforts and combating corruption is a long-term and crucial strategic task for consolidating the socialist system and ensuring the healthy development of economic construction.

In the afternoon closing session, after listening to reports from the Minister of Supervision, Wei Jianxing, and heads of supervision bureaus from various regions and units about their supervision work, Li Peng said that supervision work has achieved significant results over the past year. Especially since the Fourth Plenum, various levels of supervision departments have done a great deal of work in the fight against corruption, investigating and handling many major cases. This has improved party discipline, government conduct, and social morals nationwide, winning the support of the broad masses of the people, enhancing the prestige of the party and government, and increasing the authority of the supervision departments. The convening of this conference will further promote supervision work in the coming year.

Li Peng pointed out that the supervision work in the coming year should closely follow the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenums of the Thirteenth Central Committee, continuing to focus on anti-corruption efforts and legal supervision. He said that the fight against corruption requires long-term planning. Because we are still in the primary stage of socialism, many economic systems are not yet perfect, and legal construction is not yet complete, providing opportunities for illegal activities. At the same time, due to the policy of opening up to the outside world, while introducing advanced technology and management experience, some decadent foreign influences may also sneak in. Therefore, the fight against corruption is a long-term task, not a temporary measure. We must persist in fighting corruption and strengthening clean governance to resist the infiltration of various decadent ideologies, to strengthen the relationship between the party and the people, and to fully utilize the advantages of the socialist system. To this end, supervision cadres at all levels must have a full understanding.

Li Peng, in his speech, affirmed the conference's proposal that an important task for administrative supervision agencies in the coming year is to focus on rectification and deepening reform through legal supervision. He said that to carry out rectification and deepening reform, we must mobilize the enthusiasm of both the central and local governments. However, for the overall and comprehensive interests, some local and partial interests may need to be adjusted. Therefore, the focus of legal supervision work should be on maintaining and strengthening the centralized and unified implementation of central policies and laws, opposing localism and decentralization. For those who disobey orders and violate prohibitions, typical cases must be seriously investigated and dealt with to maintain the seriousness of party discipline and the smooth implementation of government orders, ensuring the smooth progress of rectification and deepening reform.

In discussing enterprise supervision work, Li Peng pointed out that enterprises must also act in accordance with the law, and enterprise cadres must also be clean, especially those appointed by the state to enterprises, who should be subject to supervision like state personnel. He said that in enterprises, we must strengthen the education of thrift and oppose extravagance and waste. An enterprise relying on speculation may gain temporary benefits, but it will not last. Expanding the market and promoting products can be done through legitimate means, relying on the advantages of good product quality, reasonable prices, and good service to compete, abandoning those vulgar and corrupt practices of entertaining and bribing.

In discussing the work of the supervision departments themselves, Li Peng pointed out that the focus is on investigating major cases with significant influence. In the process of investigation, we must dare to confront difficulties, overcome obstacles, and be practical and methodical, standing the test of history. He hopes that party committees and governments at all levels will care for and protect supervision cadres, shield them from retaliation, and create necessary working conditions for them. At the same time, supervision agencies at all levels should strengthen their own construction, strive to improve their political and professional qualities, and truly become a reliable force for clean governance that the party and government trust, and that the people trust, playing their due role in socialist construction.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian and State Councilor Li Tieying also attended the meeting today.

    李鹏在全国监察工作会议上指出
    党风政风社会风气都有好转
    监察工作既要排除阻力又要实事求是讲求方法
    新华社北京12月25日电　（记者何平）国务院总理李鹏在今天结束的全国监察工作会议上指出，加强廉政建设，开展反腐败斗争，是巩固社会主义制度，保证经济建设沿着健康轨道前进的一项长期的、重要的战略任务。
    在今天下午的闭幕会上，李鹏在听取了监察部部长尉健行和一些地方、单位的监察厅（局）负责人关于监察工作的汇报后说，监察工作一年来取得了很大成绩，特别是四中全会以来，各级监察部门在开展反腐败斗争中做了大量工作，查处了许多大案要案，使我们的党风、政风和社会风气在全国范围内有了好转，受到广大人民群众的欢迎，党和政府的威信在提高，监察部门的权威性也在提高。这次会议的召开，将对明年的监察工作起进一步推进作用。
    李鹏指出，明年的监察工作要紧紧围绕党的十三届四中全会和五中全会精神，继续以反腐败斗争和执法监察为重点。他说，反腐败斗争要有长期打算。因为我们还处在社会主义初级阶段，在发展有计划的商品经济过程中，许多经济制度还不完善，法制建设还不够健全，使一些不法行为有机可乘；同时，由于实行对外开放政策，在引进先进技术和管理经验的同时，某些外来腐朽的东西难免会乘虚而入。因此，反腐败斗争是一项长期的任务，绝不是权宜之计。我们要坚持开展反腐败斗争，加强廉政建设，以便抵御各种腐朽思想的侵蚀，密切党群关系、干群关系，充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性。对此，各级监察干部一定要有充分的认识。
    李鹏在讲话中肯定了会议提出的明年行政监察机关的一项重要任务，就是围绕治理整顿、深化改革开展执法监察的打算。他说，要搞好治理整顿，当然要调动中央和地方两个积极性，但是也要看到，为了全局的、整体的利益，某些局部的、地方的利益难免要作出一些调整。因此，执法监察工作的着眼点要放在维护和加强中央政策和法令的集中统一上，反对各行其是、分散主义。对于那些有令不行、有禁不止的典型案件，要严肃查处，以维护党纪的严肃性和政令的畅通，保证治理整顿和深化改革的顺利进行。
    在谈到企业监察工作时，李鹏指出，企业也要依法行事，企业各级干部也应廉洁，特别是国家委派到企业的干部，应与国家工作人员一样属于接受监察的范围。他说，在企业中必须加强勤俭办企业的教育，杜绝铺张浪费等现象。一个企业依靠投机取巧，可能取得暂时的利益，但绝不会持久。开拓市场，推销产品，完全可以采取正当手段，依靠自己产品的质量优良，价格合理，服务周到等优势开展竞争，抛弃那些请客送礼，甚至贿赂等庸俗腐败的作法。
    在谈到监察部门自身的工作时，李鹏指出，工作的重点是查处有影响的大案要案。在查处的过程中，既要敢于碰硬，排除阻力，又要实事求是，讲求方法，经得住历史的检验。他希望各级党委和政府关心和爱护监察干部，保护他们避免受到打击报复，为他们创造必要的工作条件。同时，各级监察机关要加强队伍的自身建设，努力提高政治和业务素质，真正成为党和政府信任、人民信任的廉政建设的可靠力量，在社会主义建设中发挥应有作用。
    国务院副总理吴学谦、国务委员李铁映也出席了今天的会议。
