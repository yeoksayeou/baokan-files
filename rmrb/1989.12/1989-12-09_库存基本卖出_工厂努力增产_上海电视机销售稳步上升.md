    Shanghai's home appliance market has seen a new turnaround in sales. Following the recent rebound in VCR sales, black-and-white and color television sales have also begun to rise steadily.

    Today, reporters learned from Shanghai Radio Factory No. 4 that since the beginning of this month, users from various provinces and cities across the country, as well as local users, have been flocking to the service department on Huaihai West Road to purchase black-and-white and color televisions. Among them, a commercial unit in Linyi, Shandong Province, placed an order for as many as 4,000 units in a single purchase. The factory's supply of black-and-white televisions for December is approximately 100,000 units, all of which have been pre-ordered by today, and all payments have been made in full. The daily sales volume at the service department has increased to around 100 units per day, with many of these being rural consumers from the suburbs who have come to purchase after receiving their year-end bonuses. Shanghai Radio Factory No. 4's "Kai Ge" brand color TVs, which had previously been stockpiled at 20,000 units, have now been completely sold out. The factory is now striving to increase production.

    The sales outlook for Shanghai's branded color TVs is also positive. Shanghai TV Factory No. 1's 36cm, 46cm, and 51cm "Jin Xing" color TVs in three different sizes have all been sold out. Local businesspeople analyze that with the domestic TV industry implementing "production control and price protection" measures next year, it will stimulate the TV market to change from its sluggish state and move towards recovery.

    库存基本卖出  工厂努力增产
    上海电视机销售稳步上升
    本报讯　据新民晚报报道：上海家电市场出现新的销售转机。继录像机销售日前出现回升之后，黑白、彩色电视机的销售亦开始稳步上升。
    记者今天从上海无线电四厂获悉：从本月初开始，全国兄弟省、市及本市的用户络绎不绝地来到淮海西路上无四厂经营服务部，要求购买黑白、彩色电视机。其中山东省临沂地区一家商业单位的一次要货就高达4000台。12月份工厂的黑白电视机供应数约达10万台。到今天为止已全部预订一空，而且全部是现付金额。经营服务部月初日销量已升至每日100台左右，其中不少是年终分红后从市郊赶来的农村消费者。上无四厂的“凯歌”牌彩电曾一度积压达2万台，至今已全部销完。工厂正努力增产。
    沪产名牌彩电的销售也看好。上海电视一厂36厘米、46厘米、51厘米等3种规格的“金星”彩电，现全部售出。本市商界人士分析：由于明年的国内电视机工业采取“限产保价”措施，它将刺激电视机市场改变疲软现状，走向复苏。
