At the foot of Mount Song in the central plains, in a highland area of Xicun Township, two stone tablets stand tall. The central content of the inscriptions on both tablets is the character "water." One was erected during the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, and the other in 1989.

The history of Xicun Township is a history of generations yearning for water. This place is characterized by rolling hills, deep gullies, and water as precious as oil. For thousands of years, people have relied on carrying water on their shoulders and transporting it by donkey. In the past, people had fought over water numerous times.

Today, upon entering Xicun Township, one can turn on the faucet in any household to find clear, sweet tap water flowing out. In Xicun Township's 16 villages, except for a few isolated households in remote mountain valleys, every family has access to tap water. The days of water being as precious as oil and people fighting over it are gone forever. To commemorate this, the people of Xicun erected another stone tablet. The inscription reads: "Drinking water, remembering the source, feeling the Party's affection, a thousand-year great cause, shining for posterity, benefiting the people, engraved in stone as evidence."

When discussing the water project, Xicun Township Party Secretary Yang Xuezhong said only one simple sentence: "It has been 40 years since liberation. If we cannot solve the problem of the people's drinking water, we would be unworthy of the title of Communist Party member."

As early as six years ago, the Xicun Township Party Committee and government, in response to the people's urgent needs, made a resolute decision to work hard for several years to completely solve the problem of the people's difficulty in obtaining water. When the first engineering plan was formulated, the first problem they encountered was funding. The township Party Committee and government took out the 20,000 yuan allocated for repairing the office building. The old village head of Dongcun, He Tianxi, also contributed 2,000 yuan that his son had saved for his wedding. When the project began, it was the cold winter months. Party members and cadres led technical personnel and the masses to work day and night on the construction site.

After the first phase of the project was completed, the Xicun Township water project continued in the remaining 15 villages. Wherever the project went, stories of Party members and cadres working hard and diligently spread...

By this summer, the Xicun Township water project had only the most impoverished and remote village of Wuling left. Over 50-year-old township cadre and Communist Party member Li Jiang volunteered to take on this task. He brought two young cadres, braving the summer heat, carrying luggage, pots, and food to Wuling Village to set up camp.

They mobilized and led the masses to work hard for 37 days, finally completing the most difficult water supply project in the entire township.

    饮水思源  倍觉党亲
    本报记者　李而亮
    在中原嵩山脚下西村乡一片高地上，竖立着两座石碑，碑文的中心内容都是一个
  “水”字。一座立自清朝同治年间，一座立自1989年。
    西村乡的历史是一个世代盼水的历史。这里群山起伏、沟壑纵横、水贵如油。千百年来，人们的吃水靠肩担驴驮。为了水，历史上人们曾发生过多次械斗。
    今日走进西村乡，到农家打开水龙头，清甜的自来水直流而出。西村乡16个村，除极个别偏僻山沟的农户外，家家都吃上了自来水。以往那种吃水贵如油，抢水打破头的历史一去不返。为此，西村人又立下一座石碑。碑文是“饮水思源、倍觉党亲、千秋伟业、昭彰后世、造福于民、刻石为证”。
    西村乡党委书记杨学忠谈到吃水工程，他只说了一句很朴实的话：“解放40年了，要是连群众的吃水问题都解决不了，那就愧对共产党员这个称号。”
    早在6年前，西村乡党委、政府针对群众的切身要求，立下了苦干数年，彻底解决群众吃水难的决心。当第一项工程方案制定后，首先碰到的是资金问题。乡党委、政府把上级拨给维修办公楼的2万元拿了出来。第一期工程所在的东村老支书贺天西把儿子准备结婚用的2000元钱也拿出来。工程动工时，正是寒冬腊月，党员干部领着技术人员、带着群众昼夜奔忙在工地上。
    第一期工程竣工后，西村乡吃水工程陆续在其余15个村展开。工程到哪里，哪里就传出党员干部苦干实干的佳话……
    到了今年夏天，西村乡吃水工程只剩下全乡最穷困、最偏僻的五岭村。年过半百的乡干部、共产党员李江自告奋勇包下这个任务。他带着2名青年干部，冒着酷暑，背着行李、锅灶、米面到五岭村安营扎寨。
    他们发动和带领群众经过37天的苦干，终于使全乡最困难的最后一处供水工程胜利完工。
