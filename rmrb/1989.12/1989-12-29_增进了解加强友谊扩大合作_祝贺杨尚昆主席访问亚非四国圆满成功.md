Chairman Yang Shangkun's official friendly visit to the Arab Republic of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, the State of Kuwait, and the Sultanate of Oman has been successfully completed. This visit has enhanced the friendly cooperative relationship between China and the four Asian and African countries in the political, economic, and other fields. Chairman Yang's visit has not only developed the friendship between China and the four Asian and African countries to a new stage but has also written a new chapter in the history of China's friendly cooperation with the Third World. We warmly congratulate Chairman Yang on the successful visit to the four Asian and African countries.

This visit by Chairman Yang to the four Asian and African countries is the first overseas trip by a Chinese head of state since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. This fully demonstrates that China's domestic political and economic situation is stable, that China's reform and opening-up policy remains unchanged, and that China's foreign policy of developing friendly cooperative relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence remains unchanged. This visit has great significance and far-reaching influence.

Developing friendly cooperative relations with Third World countries is the fundamental basis of China's foreign policy. Egypt, the UAE, Kuwait, and Oman are all close friends of China. Historically, China has had friendly exchanges with these four countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, this friendship has been further developed. We are all Third World countries, sharing a common historical experience of suffering from foreign oppression and exploitation, and facing the common task of maintaining national independence and sovereignty and developing our own economies.

Chairman Yang's visit to the four Asian and African countries has attracted widespread international attention. During the visit, Chairman Yang and his delegation were warmly received and enthusiastically welcomed by the governments and peoples of the four countries. In just 11 days, Chairman Yang held multiple talks and meetings with the leaders of the four countries, exchanging views on further strengthening bilateral relations and international issues of common concern, and reaching broad consensus. Chairman Yang also introduced the domestic situation and foreign policy of China and the four countries to each other. The leaders of the four countries expressed their satisfaction with the stable political and economic situation in China. Chairman Yang's visit to the four Asian and African countries and the successful outcome fully demonstrate that the Third World countries are the true friends of the Chinese people.

The continuous development of friendly cooperative relations between China and the four Asian and African countries is based on the solid political foundation of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have proven to be a powerful force, guiding the harmonious coexistence between countries, embodying the essence of new international relations, reflecting the fundamental interests of all countries, and are correct international relations norms tested by practice.

Peace and development are the two major themes of the current world. The international situation has undergone significant changes. Hegemonism is increasingly untenable. However, hegemony has not withdrawn from the international stage, and there are still instances of interference in the internal affairs of other countries through various means in international exchanges, which violates international norms and is not conducive to the easing of the international situation. People of all countries hope for a peaceful and stable international environment to develop production and build their countries. The Chinese people are determined to strengthen unity with the people of all countries, continue to oppose hegemony, safeguard world peace, and strive unremittingly to establish a new international political and economic order.

The Middle East issue is a hotspot in the world. Over the past year, the situation in the Middle East has undergone positive changes, and the trend of politically resolving the Middle East issue has further developed. Egypt and other Arab countries have made unremitting efforts to promote the resolution of the Middle East issue. The Chinese government appreciates President Mubarak's active efforts to promote the Middle East peace process. We firmly support the just cause of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. We believe that resolving the Middle East issue through political means is the best choice. We support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations to justly, reasonably, and comprehensively resolve the Middle East issue.

Developing friendly cooperative relations with the Gulf countries is China's established policy. We appreciate the active contributions made by the Gulf countries to maintain regional security and stability and promote the progress of the Iran-Iraq talks. We hope that the Gulf countries will unite and strengthen cooperation for common development.

Chairman Yang's visit to the four Asian and African countries, though brief, has yielded fruitful results. It can be foreseen that through this visit, the friendly cooperative relations between China and the four Asian and African countries will reach a new level. We sincerely wish for the further development of friendship between China and Egypt, the UAE, Kuwait, and Oman.

    增进了解加强友谊扩大合作
    ——祝贺杨尚昆主席访问亚非四国圆满成功
    杨尚昆主席对阿拉伯埃及共和国、阿拉伯联合酋长国、科威特国和阿曼苏丹国的正式友好访问已经圆满结束。这次访问增进了我国与亚非4国在政治、经济等领域的友好合作关系。杨主席的访问不仅把我国同亚非4国的友谊发展到了一个新的阶段，而且也在我国同第三世界友好合作的历史上写下了新的一页。我们对杨主席访问亚非4国获得圆满成功表示热烈祝贺。
    杨主席这次访问亚非4国是我国平息反革命暴乱后，我国国家主席第一次出访。这充分说明我国国内政治、经济形势是稳定的，说明我国的改革开放政策不变，说明我国在和平共处五项原则基础上发展同各国友好合作关系的对外政策不变。这次访问具有重大的意义和深远的影响。
    发展同第三世界国家的友好合作关系是我国外交政策的基本立足点。埃及、阿联酋、科威特、阿曼4国都是我国的亲密朋友。在历史上我国就与4国有着友好的交往。我国与4国建交后，这种友谊得到了进一步的发展。我们同亚非4国都是第三世界国家，都有着遭受外来压迫和剥削的共同历史遭遇，都面临着维护国家独立、主权，发展本国经济的共同任务。
    杨主席亚非4国之行受到国际舆论的广泛关注。访问期间，杨主席一行受到4国政府和人民的隆重接待和热烈欢迎。在短短11天的访问中，杨主席同4国领导人进行了多次会谈和会见，就进一步加强双边关系和共同关心的国际问题交换了意见，并取得了广泛的一致。杨主席还同4国领导人相互介绍了各自国内情况和对外政策。4国领导人对我国国内政治经济形势的稳定表示高兴。杨主席应邀访问亚非4国并取得圆满成功，充分说明第三世界国家是中国人民的真正的朋友。
    中国同亚非4国友好合作关系的不断发展，是因为我们双方有着牢固的政治基础，共同恪守和平共处五项原则。事实证明，和平共处五项原则具有强大的生命力，是指导国与国之间和睦相处的基本原则，和平共处五项原则体现了新型国际关系的本质，反映了一切国家的根本利益，是经过实践考验的、正确的国际关系准则。
    和平与发展是当前世界两大主题。目前国际形势发生重大变化。搞霸权主义越来越行不通了。但强权政治并没有退出国际舞台，在国际交往中，利用各种手段干涉别国内政的情况时有发生，这是违背国际关系准则的，是不利于国际形势缓和的。各国人民都希望有一个和平稳定的国际环境来发展生产，建设国家。我国人民决心同各国人民加强团结，继续反对霸权主义，维护世界和平，为建立国际政治经济新秩序而进行不懈的努力。
    中东问题是世界上一个热点问题。一年来，中东形势发生了积极的变化，政治解决中东问题的趋势进一步发展。埃及和其他阿拉伯国家为推动中东问题的解决作出了不懈的努力。我国政府赞赏穆巴拉克总统积极致力于推动中东和平进程。我们坚定不移地支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民的正义事业。我们认为，通过政治途径解决中东问题是最好的选择。我们支持召开由联合国主持的中东和平国际会议，公正、合理、全面地解决中东问题。
    发展同海湾各国的友好合作关系是我国的既定政策，我们赞赏海湾国家为维护地区的安全与稳定，推动两伊和谈进程作出的积极贡献。我们希望海湾国家联合自强，加强合作，共同发展。
    杨主席这次对亚非4国的访问，时间虽然短暂，但成果丰硕。可以预见，通过这次访问，我国与亚非4国的友好合作关系将发展到一个新水平。我们衷心祝愿中国与埃及、阿联酋、科威特、阿曼4国的友谊进一步发展。
