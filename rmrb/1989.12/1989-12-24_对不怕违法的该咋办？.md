This column has previously discussed the issue of excessive urban construction land use. This issue is somewhat related to the topic of "man-made wasteland," which appears to be more severe. Large areas of "man-made wasteland" are often found in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities. According to materials provided by relevant departments, in recent years, some large and medium-sized cities have engaged in "land enclosure" projects, averaging several tens of thousands of acres of land occupied each year. Among these, a significant portion is land that was seized early but used late, seized in large quantities but used in small quantities, or even seized but not used at all. Do they not know that this is illegal? They are state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises; they may feign ignorance of the law, but in reality, they are not afraid to break it. What should we do? Our discussion has already touched on this point.

    对不怕违法的该咋办？
    本专栏前些日子专门讨论过城镇建设用地超前的问题，本期提出“人造荒地”，与之有一定联系，问题似乎更严重些。大面积“人造荒地”多出现在大中城市郊区。据有关部门提供的材料，近几年一些大中城市“圈地”上工程，平均每年占用土地几万亩，其中不少是早征迟用，多征少用，甚至征而不用。他们这样做难道不知道是违法的吗？他们是国营企业、集体企业，不知违法是假，不怕违法是真。怎么办？我们的讨论已经触及到这一点。
