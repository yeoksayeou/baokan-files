The chief of the North Korean side of the Military Armistice Commission, Choi Yi-Hyong, today wrote a letter to the chief of the United Nations Command side of the Military Armistice Commission, strongly protesting the U.S. side's violation of the military armistice agreement by transporting a large number of modern weapons into South Korea.

The protest letter pointed out that the U.S. side, in order to arm the ground troops stationed in South Korea, recently transported a large number of M-1A tanks to the port of Busan. Prior to this, the U.S. had already handed over 6 new C-130 military transport aircraft to South Korea. Soon, 120 of the latest U.S. fighter jets will also be deployed in South Korea. The U.S.'s actions seriously violate the provisions of the military armistice agreement that prohibit the introduction of various equipment from outside the Korean Peninsula.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 16th: The chief of the North Korean side of the Military Armistice Commission, Choi Yi-Hyong, today wrote a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, hoping to stop the U.S. from violating the armistice agreement.

The letter hopes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace, will pay sufficient attention to the actions of the U.S. side and take measures to stop them.

    抗议美违反停战协定
    据新华社平壤12月15日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员崔义雄，今天写信给朝鲜军事停战委员会联合国军方面首席委员，强烈抗议美国方面违反军事停战协定，把大批现代化武器运进南朝鲜。
    抗议信指出，美国方面为了武装驻南朝鲜的地面部队，最近将大批M—1A坦克运抵釜山港。在此之前，美国已将6架C—130新型军用飞机移交给了南朝鲜。不久以后还将有120架美国最新型战斗机部署在南朝鲜。美国的这一行动严重违反了军事停战协定中关于禁止从朝鲜以外地区运进各种装备的规定。
    据新华社平壤12月16日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员崔义雄今天写信给中立国监察委员会，希望阻止美国违反停战协定的行动。
    信中希望对缓和朝鲜半岛的紧张局势、维护和平负有责任的中立国监察委员会对美国方面的行动给予足够的重视，并采取措施加以阻止。
