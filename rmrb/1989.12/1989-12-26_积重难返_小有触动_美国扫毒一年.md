The drug problem is currently the most pressing social issue facing the United States and is closely related to America's future. This has almost become a consensus among the American political spectrum. New York State Deputy Governor Stan Lundine said, "Drug addiction is the greatest threat to American civilization and government since the Civil War (1861-1865)." Reviewing America's war on drugs over the past year, it can be summarized as "great determination, immense difficulties, and limited progress."

It can be said that the Bush administration, which took office at the beginning of the year, attaches great importance to the war on drugs. In early February, Bush, in his first speech after taking office as president, stated that the government is determined to completely eliminate the drug scourge and requested an additional $1 billion in anti-drug funds. On September 5, he proposed the largest anti-drug plan in U.S. history, aiming to allocate $7.8 billion in the 1990 fiscal year, focusing on strengthening legal penalties, cracking down on international drug production and smuggling, expanding detoxification medical facilities, and enhancing anti-drug education.

In terms of the actual progress made in the war on drugs, the following points can be summarized:

	— Strengthening international anti-drug operations to intercept drug sources. To support neighboring South American countries, especially Colombia, and the national anti-drug movement, the United States provided $63 million in emergency aid to Colombia in August this year, sending helicopters and technical personnel to assist in military operations to sweep drug centers. The Bush administration plans to allocate $2 billion over five years to crack down on international drug producers, traffickers, and smugglers. The United States is also seeking cooperation and assistance from countries like the Soviet Union and Interpol.

	— Legislation and law enforcement go hand in hand, strictly enforcing legal penalties. The Supreme Court confirmed in March this year a regulation by the Federal Transportation Department requiring all personnel involved in serious train accidents to undergo blood and urine tests, thus paving the way for drug testing in all industries related to public and national security. The New York City government has ordered mandatory drug testing for 53 categories of employees related to personal safety, covering nearly half of the 300,000 employees. According to the new regulations, those who refuse to be tested will be dismissed, and those found to be using drugs must undergo treatment. More than ten coastal states have deployed the National Guard and its helicopters to intercept drug smuggling. The federal government has also allocated a large sum of money to hire prosecutors, expand the police force, and build new prisons.

	— Emphasizing the role of propaganda and education. One of the important reasons why previous anti-drug efforts have been ineffective is the focus on crackdowns while neglecting prevention. To make people consciously resist drug temptations, mass media, schools, and civic organizations have taken action. Newspapers, television, and radio frequently insert warnings such as "Refuse drugs, refuse death," exposing the dangers of drugs and praising successful youth detoxification cases. According to statistics, the number of students who occasionally use drugs in the United States has significantly decreased in recent months, reaching 37%, and the proportion of occasional drug users in middle-class families has also significantly decreased.

	— The anti-drug awareness of enterprises and citizens is becoming increasingly strong. It is estimated that U.S. enterprises suffer annual losses of $150 billion due to accidents, absenteeism, theft, and deaths caused by employees' drug use and alcoholism. For their own interests, many enterprises have taken or are taking measures to effectively stop the deterioration of internal drug problems. In some major cities where drug crimes are rampant, large numbers of residents, unable to bear the chaos of social order, threats to personal safety, and the deterioration of ethics and morality, have organized themselves to patrol their residential areas, actively report drug transactions to the police, seal off abandoned houses used for drug use, and even risk their lives to stop street drug dealing.

Despite the above progress, from an overall perspective, the U.S. drug problem is deeply rooted and difficult to reverse, and at most can be described as having made some progress.

Firstly, drug-related crimes continue to occur nationwide, and the total number of drug users has not shown a significant decrease. Washington D.C., known as the "drug capital," saw its murder rate rank first in the nation last year, and this year's murder rate (as of November) is basically the same as last year. In New York City, 60% of the major criminals arrested in the third quarter of this year were related to drugs.

Secondly, the outcome of the anti-drug war in Latin America is uncertain, and drugs continue to flow into the United States, with drug transactions remaining active in various places.

Thirdly, judicial measures are still imperfect. For example, the issue of restoring the death penalty has been fiercely debated in some states and cities, but there is still no conclusion. Federal and many state prisons are overcrowded, with prisoners reaching the point of no place to be imprisoned and even rioting. The rate of prison growth is far behind the rate of crime growth.

Fourthly, medical facilities are lacking. Currently, the 5,000 medical institutions in the United States that can be used for detoxification can only accommodate 800,000 people per year. While the estimated number of drug users in the United States in 1989 was 23 million.

The U.S. drug problem is more a manifestation of a series of "social diseases" rather than just a problem between drug dealers and users. Without addressing the root cause, the symptoms will be difficult to eliminate. Drug use, dealing, poverty, unemployment, spiritual decay, and the pursuit of money and pleasure values are intertwined with complex social, economic, and cultural factors, as well as international backgrounds. In this sense, the "war on drugs" faces not just the issues of drug use and dealing, and is therefore bound to be a long-term "protracted war."

### 积重难返  小有触动——美国扫毒一年

    积重难返  小有触动
    ——美国扫毒一年
    本报记者　仓立德
    毒品问题是当今美国面临的首要社会问题，并事关美国的未来，这已几乎成为美国朝野上下的共识。纽约州副州长斯坦·伦戴恩说：“毒瘾是内战（即1861—1965年的美国南北战争）以来对美国文明和政府的最大威胁。”通观美国向毒品宣战近一年来的所作所为，似可用“决心很大，困难重重，进展有限”来概括。
    可以说，年初上台的布什政府对扫毒是相当重视的。2月初，布什在其就职总统后的首次演说中表示，政府决心全面清除毒品祸害，并要求增加10亿美元扫毒经费。9月5日，他提出一项美国迄今最为庞大的反毒品计划，拟在1990财政年度拨款78亿美元，重点加强法律制裁，打击国际毒品生产和走私，扩大戒毒医疗机构，增强反毒教育。
    在扫毒所取得的实际进展方面，大致有如下数点：
    ——加强国际缉毒行动，堵截毒源。为配合南美邻国哥伦比亚和全国性扫毒运动，美国今年8月向该国提供了6300万美元紧急援助，派遣直升机和技术人员协助扫荡毒品中心的军事行动。布什政府计划5年内拨款20亿美元，打击国际毒品生产者、贩运者和走私者。美国还寻求苏联等国家和国际刑警组织的合作和协助。
    ——立法、执法双管齐下，厉行法律制裁。最高法院今年3月最终确认了联邦运输部的一项规定，即要求涉及严重列车事故的全体职工接受血样和尿样检查，从而为有关公众和国家安全的所有行业展开吸毒检查开辟了道路。纽约市政府已下令，对53类与人身安全有关的职工实行强制性吸毒抽查，涉及面几乎占全部30万雇员的一半。根据新规定，拒绝检查者将被解雇，查出的吸毒者必须接受治疗。沿海10多州投入了国民警卫队及其直升机等装备，拦截毒品走私。联邦政府还拨出巨额专款，增聘检察官，扩充警察部队，兴建新监狱。
    ——重视宣传和教育的作用。过去肃毒收效甚微的一个重要原因是只重打击，忽略预防。为使人们自觉抵制毒品诱惑，大众传播媒介、学校及民间团体纷纷行动。报刊、电视、电台经常插入“拒绝毒品即拒绝死亡”之类的警语，揭露毒品的危害，表扬青少年戒毒成功的事例。据统计，美国学生中的偶尔吸毒人数近几个月已大幅度减少，达37％，中产阶级家庭中的偶尔吸毒者比例也已显著下降。
    ——企业、公民的反毒意识愈益强烈。据估计，美国各企业每年因职工吸毒、酗酒而造成的事故、旷工、偷盗、死亡所受损失达1500亿美元之巨。为了自身利益，许多企业已经或正在采取措施，以有效制止内部吸毒问题的恶化。在一些毒品犯罪活动猖獗的大城市，大批不堪忍受社会秩序混乱、人身安全受威胁、伦理道德败坏现象的居民，自动组织起来，在居住区四周巡逻，主动向警方报告毒品交易活动，封堵用于吸毒的废弃房屋，甚至不顾生命危险制止街头贩毒行为。
    尽管取得上述进展，从整体上看，美国的毒品问题积重难返，目前至多可称为小有触动。
    首先，全国毒品犯罪事件仍层出不穷，吸毒者总数未见明显减少。有“毒品之都”称号的华盛顿市继去年凶杀率跃居全国首位后，今年的凶杀率（截至11月）与去年基本持平。纽约市今年第三季度被捕的重大罪犯中，60％与毒品有关。
    其次，拉美的扫毒战胜负难卜，毒品仍源源不断涌入美国，各地毒品交易依然活跃。
    第三，司法措施仍欠完善。如恢复死刑问题，一些州、市激烈争论后，至今无下文。联邦和许多州的监狱人满为患，犯人已到无处可囚甚至聚众暴乱的地步。监狱增长速度远赶不上罪犯增长速度。
    再次，医疗设施缺乏。目前全美可用于戒毒的5000家医疗所，每年仅能接待80万人。而1989年全国吸毒者估计达2300万。
    美国的毒品问题，与其说是贩毒者与吸毒者之间的问题，毋宁说是一系列“社会病灶”的综合反应。病根不除，症状难消。吸毒、贩毒与贫困、失业、精神颓废、追求金钱与享乐的价值观等社会经济、文化因素交织在一起，并有着复杂的国际背景。从这个意义上说，这场“扫毒战争”所面临的对手决不仅仅是吸毒、贩毒问题，因此必然是一场漫长的“持久战”。
