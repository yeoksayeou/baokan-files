The Workers' Party of Korea and the government attach great importance to youth education, considering it a crucial issue for the nation's future. Recently, a reporter interviewed the highest leadership body of North Korean youth organizations—the Central Committee of the Socialist Patriotic Youth League (abbreviated as "SPYL"). Kim Myong-chol, the propaganda department head of the SPYL, introduced some details about youth education.

In North Korea, youth aged 14 to 19 are members of the SPYL. Currently, there are 4.5 million members. The SPYL, taking into account the characteristics of youth such as their love for learning, enthusiasm, quick acceptance of new things, and spirit of dedication, adopts various forms to educate young people.

Establishing "Youth Houses"
"Youth Houses" are specialized venues for youth to study and entertain, spread across urban and rural areas. Whether students, workers, or office personnel and cooperative farm members, all actively participate in collective activities organized by "Youth Houses," such as studying the Party's policies and guidelines. They engage in individual study and collective study once a month. During the study sessions, they can discuss and share their insights. This way, each young person can deepen their understanding of the Party's various policies and guidelines, enhancing their self-awareness in taking action.

Organizing Reading and Cultural Activities
The SPYL Central Committee requires each young person to read 50 pages of books daily during their spare time, including books on politics, economics, culture, and technology, and to write reading notes. At the end of the year, they must write a summary based on their study plan.

To improve the cultural level of youth, the SPYL Central Committee has designated the first Sunday of every month as "Youth Day." On "Youth Day," youth organizations hold collective activities such as sports competitions, poetry recitals, calligraphy, and painting. Additionally, there are two dance parties held every week. Since 1987, a nationwide solo music competition has been held annually, and in the summer, a "Literature Night Gala" is organized. Youth from different fronts gather together to discuss and debate topics related to life and youth.

Organizing Visits and Tours
School SPYL organizations often arrange for students to visit revolutionary historical sites and museums. To provide revolutionary tradition education to youth in remote areas, the Central Revolutionary War Museum of Korea has replicated exhibits into portable models for nationwide tours. Today, North Korean youth strive to inherit and carry forward revolutionary traditions, maintaining a simple and frugal lifestyle. The SPYL Central Committee also organizes local youth to visit the capital, Pyongyang, in batches, so that youth can better understand their country and love their capital. In July of this year, the 13th World Youth Festival was held in Pyongyang, where North Korean youth demonstrated the fine spiritual outlook and moral conduct of socialist youth, receiving praise from youth of various countries.

Currently, North Korea is conducting education on the superiority of socialism, enabling the broad masses of youth to understand their country's history, present, and future, and thus better adhere to the Party's leadership and persist in the socialist path.

    朝鲜重视青年教育
    黎能清
    朝鲜劳动党和政府注重对青年的教育工作，把它当作是关系到国家前途的大问题来抓。不久前记者采访了朝鲜青年组织的最高领导机构——社会主义劳动青年同盟中央委员会（简称“社劳青”），“社劳青”的宣传部长金明哲同志介绍了有关青年教育的一些情况。
    在朝鲜，从14岁到19岁的青年人为“社劳青”组织成员。目前，共有450万成员。“社劳青”根据青年爱学习、热情高、接受新事物快、富有献身精神等特点，采取多种形式对青年进行教育。
    创办“青年之家”
    “青年之家”是专门供青年学习、娱乐的场所，遍及城乡。不论是学生、工人，还是机关干部、合作农场的场员，都自觉地参加“青年之家”组织的集体活动，如在“青年之家”学习劳动党的方针政策，平时个人学习，每月集中学习一次。学习中，既可以讨论，也可以讲心得体会。这样，每个青年就能够加深对劳动党的各种方针政策的理解，增强行动的自觉性。
    开展读书和文化活动
    “社劳青”中央要求每个青年每天利用业余时间读50页书，包括政治、经济、文化、科技等各类书籍，并写出读书笔记，年终还要对照自己的学习计划写出总结。
    为了提高青年的文化素质，“社劳青”中央规定，每月第一个星期日为“青年日”。“青年日”这一天，由青年组织举办体育比赛、诗歌朗诵、书法绘画等集体活动。此外，每周还举办两次舞会。从1987年开始，每年都开展一次全国性的独唱音乐比赛会，夏季还举办“文学之夜联欢会”，来自不同战线的青年欢聚在一起，开展对人生、青春的讨论和辩论。
    组织参观访问
    学校的“社劳青”组织经常组织学生参观革命史迹地和革命历史博物馆。为了使偏僻地区的青年受到革命传统教育，朝鲜中央革命战争纪念馆将陈列的物品复制成便于携带的模型，到全国各地巡回展出。今天，朝鲜的青年都努力继承发扬革命传统，保持艰苦朴素的生活作风。“社劳青”中央还分期分批组织地方青年到首都平壤参观，使青年们更加了解自己的祖国，热爱自己的首都。今年7月，第13届世界青年联欢节在平壤举行，朝鲜青年表现出了社会主义青年良好的精神面貌和道德风尚，受到各国青年的好评。
    目前，朝鲜正在对青年进行社会主义优越性的教育，使广大青年了解自己国家的历史、现在和未来，从而更好地坚持党的领导，坚持走社会主义道路。
