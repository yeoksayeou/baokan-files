Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th.

The production of local specialty products in China has seen steady growth over the past few years, with most varieties experiencing stable development. However, some production areas have encountered product backlogs. The Ministry of Commerce has urged local authorities to prioritize the procurement and sales of local specialty products alongside grain, cotton, and oil, to alleviate farmers' burdens and enrich market supply.

Data from the Ministry of Commerce indicates that this year's national fruit production is expected to reach over 18 million tons, a 12.5% increase from last year. Honey production is projected at 180,000 tons, up 20%, and edible fungi at 750,000 tons, a 7% increase. Tea and sheep wool production remained stable at 510,000 tons and 200,000 tons, respectively. The quality of local specialty products procured by the national supply and marketing cooperatives has generally improved, with prices slightly lower than last year. The procurement order in production areas is better than in previous years. However, as of the latest reports, procurement progress in various regions has been slow. Citrus fruits in Sichuan and Zhejiang, sheep wool in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, mushrooms in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, dried chilies in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, wood ear mushrooms in Hubei and Henan, Sichuan pepper in Hebei and Shandong, and black pepper in Hainan have all faced varying degrees of difficulties in sales and purchases. For instance, Sichuan Province anticipates a citrus production of 9.2 million tons this year, nearly 60% higher than last year. Of the 4 million tons of red oranges that should have been harvested by early December, a significant portion remains unharvested due to slow procurement. In Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, nearly 27,000 tons of sheep wool and some cattle and sheep hides are still with the herders.

Local business departments also face severe stockpiling issues. From January to October this year, the national supply and marketing cooperatives' inventory of sheep wool increased by 43% compared to the same period last year.

Vice Minister of Commerce Pan Yao stated at today's press conference that the backlog of local specialty products is primarily due to market stagnation, with most products' sales volumes this year lower than the same period last year. Additionally, there are numerous and repetitive tax levies, and insufficient procurement funds have led to heavy interest burdens on business units. He hopes that local supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commercial business departments will collaborate with relevant societal forces to do everything possible to improve the procurement and sales of local specialty products, ensuring they do not remain with farmers and do not spoil. He also suggests that banks, tax authorities, transportation departments, and other relevant authorities continue to support the operation of local specialty products.

    扭转积压局面  丰富市场供应
    商业部要求抓好土特产购销
    本报北京12月14日讯　记者潘岗报道：我国土特产品生产在连续几年增产的基础上，多数品种今年又有了稳步发展，部分产区出现了产品积压现象。商业部要求各地在做好粮、棉、油收购的同时，重视抓好土特产品购销工作，为农民排忧解难，丰富市场供应。
    商业部提供的资料表明，今年全国水果产量可达1800多万吨，比上年增长12.5％；蜂蜜产量18万吨，增长20％；食用菌75万吨，增长7％。茶叶、绵羊毛产量分别为51万吨、20万吨，与上年基本持平。今年全国供销社系统收购的土特产品质量普遍有所提高，价格比上年有所回落，产区收购秩序也好于往年。但截至日前，各地收购进度迟缓，四川、浙江等地的柑桔，内蒙古、新疆等地的绵羊毛，福建、浙江、江苏等地的蘑菇，四川、湖北、陕西等地的辣椒干，湖北、河南等地的木耳，河北、山东等地的花椒，海南的胡椒等，都出现了不同程度的卖难买难现象。如，今年四川省预计柑桔产量达92万吨，比去年增长近6成，其中40万吨红桔本应12月初上市，因收购缓慢，至今仍有大部分红桔未能下树。内蒙古、新疆尚有近2.7万吨羊毛和部分牛羊皮滞留在牧民手中。
    各地经营部门库存积压也很严重。今年1—10月，全国供销社系统绵羊毛库存比上年同期增长43％。
    商业部副部长潘遥在今天的新闻发布会上说，土特产品积压主要是由于市场疲软，今年大部分土特产品销售量比去年同期下降；各种税费名目繁多，重复征收和乱收税费的情况时有发生；收购资金不足，经营单位利息负担过重。他希望各地供销社和国营商业经营部门协同社会各有关方面的力量，千方百计把土特产品购销工作搞好，不能压在农民手中，更不能烂掉。同时建议银行、税务、交通等有关部门对土特产品经营继续给予支持。
