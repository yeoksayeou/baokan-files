In the 1980s, there is a group of people who have endured hardships that cannot be quantified and created wealth that is immeasurable. "Thirty years of battling across the country to achieve greatness, five thousand soldiers paving roads and building bridges to create miracles." A writer's inscription perfectly captures them—the Third Engineering Bureau's Second Engineering Division.

"Bound by Hardship"

The Second Engineering Division was established in 1958 and is responsible for building railways, bridges, and roads. Apart from the division headquarters in Shijiazhuang, the 13 engineering teams are all located in remote areas far from the city. The staff of this division sums up their working conditions with the phrase: "We are bound by the word 'hardship,' and we find joy in life through hardship."

In the spring of 1987, while everyone was enjoying family reunions during the Spring Festival, 11 employees of this division were rushing to build a railway at a construction site on the border of Shanxi and Henan. The mountains were covered in snow, and the cold wind cut to the bone. They had to climb mountains to buy food from local villagers and melt snow for water to cook. A few days later, the snow around them was "eaten" away, revealing the rocks. They jokingly said: "The heavens gave us a 'cold treatment.'"

There is "cold treatment," and there is also "heat treatment." The previous summer, they were working on the Zhegan Railway. During the rainy season, their legs would blister and fester, and in the dry season, the temperature would rise above 40°C. Male workers would peel off layers of skin from the sun. Female workers would leave bloody imprints on the steel bars heated to 60°C, but no one was willing to rest. Thus, 17 people collapsed one after another on the construction site. A reporter, seeing this, was deeply moved: This is a scene from the 1980s, but with the spirit of the 1950s!

The mobile nature of their work has made many employees indifferent to the concept of "home." Yan Gaogang's Party Committee Secretary, Yuan Zhongyue, recounted an incident: A young employee went home to visit his family. Because his child had not seen his father for over a year, upon seeing him, the child called him "Uncle."

When discussing these hardships, the employees of the Second Division do not feel sad. Because they regard hard work and perseverance as the spirit of the Second Division. One employee put it simply: When we see trains and cars passing on the roads we have built, we feel a sweet satisfaction, and all the past hardships are forgotten.

"Chinese workers, amazing!"

In 1986, the construction of the public road from Yancity to Gaotang in Shandong was put out for international bidding. The Second Division competed with eight countries, including Japan, West Germany, and Yugoslavia, and won the bid. Due to the low initial bid, the subsequent significant increase in raw material prices put the Second Division in a severe predicament, and the employees did not receive bonuses for five consecutive months.

What to do? The Second Division mobilized party members, cadres, and employees to discuss, and the main theme was eight words: self-reliance and hard work. Everyone understood that building the Yan-Gao road was an international bid, funded by the World Bank. Whether it could be completed on time and with high quality was a matter of national prestige and a heavy responsibility!

The cadres took the lead. The seven leaders of the division all went to the construction site and fought alongside the workers. Over the past half year, the director and secretary barely spent a complete holiday at home.

The party members took the lead. In April last year, the first team encountered quicksand while excavating the bridge foundation for the public road. After three days, there was still no progress. That night, the party branch held a meeting and decided to "mobilize all party members to fight the landslide." Party members who were about to sleep immediately picked up their tools and rushed to the construction site. They jumped one by one into the 2-meter-deep pit, standing in the waist-deep mud to excavate. The mud was ice-cold; the sand kept sliding down. The party members, risking the danger of a landslide, fought for over three hours and finally completed the bridge foundation.

The workers also rallied, overcoming one difficulty after another. At the critical moment of racing against time, some postponed their weddings, some gave up visiting their families, and some did not leave the construction site even when their family members were sick...

Spirit turned into substance. The spirit of self-reliance and hard work inspired the broad masses of employees. The Yan-Gao road was extended, and it was completed ahead of schedule with high quality. A foreign expert exclaimed: "Chinese workers, amazing!"

"Still feel at ease here!"

"I dedicate my youth to the railway, and after my youth, I dedicate my life." The creation, development, and growth of the Second Division are all inseparable from the spirit of hard work and perseverance.

New workers on the job, they talk about hard work and perseverance. Before every engineering battle, they talk about hard work and perseverance. Studying central policies, opposing bourgeois liberalization, they still talk about hard work and perseverance. This spirit has been passed down from generation to generation, becoming the spirit of the Second Division. Over the past 30 years, the leadership of the Second Division has changed several times, and party members have been developed in batches, but the spirit of hard work and perseverance has not changed.

There is such a record: In 1988, the seven members of the Second Division Party Committee averaged 122 days of on-site office work and labor, with the director working 195 days and the party secretary 168 days.

There is such an incident: Once, the Yan-Gao construction site's first team used a passenger car and an open car to send employees back home for the Spring Festival. The branch secretary first climbed onto the open car and called out: "Communist Party members sit in the open car!" The party members were cold, but their hearts were warmed by the workers.

No wonder the employees of the Second Division say that the cadres here are good, the party members are good, the atmosphere is good, and even if it is hard and tiring, they are willing. It is the spirit of hard work and perseverance that gives the Second Division such strong cohesion and attraction.

Last year, two young workers who had just arrived complained about the hardships of the construction site and the low pay, and secretly went to work at another factory. But after half a month, they both quietly returned. They told everyone: "Still feel at ease here!" The stories of the Second Engineering Division are moving. The deeds of the employees here are ordinary yet great. They spread the spirit of hard work and perseverance along the railways to all directions, letting the song of dedication echo forever on the transportation arteries.

    铺路架桥建奇功
    ——记铁道部第三工程局第二工程处艰苦奋斗的事迹
    本报记者　陈国琦
    在80年代的今天，有这样一群人——他们付出的艰辛，无法用数字计算；他们创造的财富，难以用价值衡量。“三十载转战南北创伟业，五千兵铺路架桥建奇功。”一位作家的这幅题词，是对他们——铁道部第三工程局第二工程处恰如其分的评价。
    “和艰苦结下不解之缘”
    工程二处创建于1958年，担负着建铁路、架桥梁、修公路等繁重任务。除处机关设在石家庄市外，下属13个工程队均在远离闹市的偏僻之乡。这个处的干部职工用这样一句话概括他们的工作条件：“我们和‘艰苦’二字结下不解之缘，我们在艰苦中品味着人生的乐趣。”
    1987年春节，正当人们吃团圆饺子之时，这个处的11名职工却在晋豫交界一个工点抢建铁路。大雪封山，寒风透骨。他们翻山越岭到老百姓家买些粮食，化雪水做饭。几天以后，周围的雪竟被他们“吃”光，露出了石头。他们风趣地说：老天爷给我们来了次“冷加工”。
    有“冷加工”，也有“热处理”。前年夏天他们在浙赣铁路施工，雨天两腿起水泡溃烂，晴天气温高达40℃以上。男职工身上晒得脱下一层层皮。女职工在温度高达60℃的钢筋上烙起一道道血印，但大家仍不肯休息。就这样，17个人一个接一个晕倒在工地。一位记者见状感慨万端：这是80年代的镜头，50年代的劲头！
    流动的工作，使许多职工淡化了“家”的概念。晏高工地党委书记袁忠跃讲了这样一件事：一位青年职工探亲，由于孩子一年多没见到爸爸，一见面竟喊起“大舅”来。
    谈及这些，二处的职工并不感到伤感。因为，他们把艰苦奋斗作为二处的企业精神。一位职工说得朴实无华：当看到火车汽车从我们修的路上通过时，心里感到甜滋滋的，以往吃的苦早忘光了。
    “中国工人，了不起！”
    1986年，山东晏城至高唐的公路工程进行国际招标，二处与日本、西德、南斯拉夫等8个国家竞争，一举夺标。由于当时标价低，后来原材料大幅度涨价，二处面临严重困难，职工连续5个月没发奖金。
    怎么办？二处发动党员、干部、职工展开讨论，主旋律是8个字：自力更生，艰苦奋斗。大家清楚，铺建晏高公路是国际投标，由世界银行贷款，能否按期高质量完成，事关祖国声誉，责任重大啊！
    干部上阵了。处里7位领导全部来到工地，与工人一起奋战。半年多来，处长、书记几乎没在家过一个完整的节假日。
    党员冲上去了。去年4月，一队挖公路桥基时，遇上流沙，前边挖后边塌方，3天后仍无进展。晚上，党支部召开会议，作出“全队党员齐上阵，连续作战战塌方”的决议。准备入睡的党员听到这个消息，立即扛起工具奔赴工地。他们一个接一个跳进2米深的坑里，站在齐腰深的泥浆中挖泥。泥浆，冰凉冰凉；泥沙，时时下滑。党员们冒着塌方的危险，经过3个多小时的拚搏，终于挖好了桥基。
    职工们也鼓足了劲，克服了一个又一个困难，在争时间抢速度的关键时刻，有的推迟了婚期，有的放弃了探亲，有的家属病了也不离开工地……
    精神变物质。自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神鼓舞着广大职工。晏高公路在延伸，优质高效胜利完工了。一位外国专家连连称颂：“中国工人，了不起！”
    “还是在这儿心里舒坦！”
    “我为铁路献青春，献了青春献终身”。二处的创建、发展和壮大，都离不开艰苦奋斗这个“传家宝”。
    新工人上岗，他们要讲艰苦奋斗。每项工程战前动员，要讲艰苦奋斗。学习中央政策，反对资产阶级自由化，还是讲艰苦奋斗。这种精神一代一代传下去，成了二处的企业精神。30多年来，二处的领导换了一茬又一茬，党员发展了一批又一批，可艰苦奋斗精神没有变。
    有这样一张表：1988年，二处党委7名成员，平均深入一线办公、劳动122天，其中处长195天，党委书记168天。
    有这样一件事：一次，晏高工地一机队用客车和敞车送职工回家过春节。支部书记先爬上敞车，并招呼：“共产党员坐敞车！”党员挨了冻，却温暖了工人心。
    难怪二处的职工说，二处的干部好，党员好，风气好，在这里再苦再累也心甘情愿。正是艰苦奋斗精神，使二处具有这么强的凝聚力和吸引力。
    去年，有两名刚来不久的青年工人嫌工地苦，挣钱少，偷偷到另一个厂里上了班。但半月过后，他俩又悄悄回来了。逢人就说：“还是在这儿心里舒坦！”工程二处发生的故事，可歌可泣。这里职工的所作所为，平凡而伟大。他们把艰苦奋斗精神随铁路传向四面八方，让奉献之歌在交通动脉上永远回荡。
