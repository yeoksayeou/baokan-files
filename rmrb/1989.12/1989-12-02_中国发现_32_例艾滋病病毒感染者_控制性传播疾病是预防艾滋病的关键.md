	China Discovers 32 Cases of HIV Infection
	Controlling Sexually Transmitted Diseases is Key to Preventing AIDS

	BEIJING, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- The resurgence of sexually transmitted diseases in China poses a serious threat to the health of the Chinese people and is the primary risk factor for the spread of AIDS into the country. Controlling the spread of sexually transmitted diseases is crucial for preventing AIDS, according to experts at a seminar held in Beijing today to mark World AIDS Day.

	In addition to the three AIDS cases reported in China since June 1985, which were all imported from abroad, a total of 29 HIV infections have been detected nationwide through monitoring. Of these, 14 cases (46 percent) were found in Beijing. Four cases involved domestic hemophiliacs who were infected through the use of imported blood products, one case was a sexually transmitted disease patient in Beijing, one case was a person who had returned from Africa after working there, and the remaining 23 cases were foreigners.

	Materials presented at the seminar indicated that from the early 1980s to June of this year, a total of 204,077 cases of sexually transmitted diseases have been reported nationwide, affecting 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. The incidence rate for the first half of this year increased by 105.16 percent compared to the same period last year. Recent trends in sexually transmitted diseases in China include an increase in rural patients, an increase in child patients, and a rise in hidden infections among the general population compared to high-risk groups.

	Experts attending the seminar called for joint efforts by all levels of government, relevant departments, and mass organizations to comprehensively address the social environment. Only through such collective efforts can the root causes of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS be eliminated.

    中国发现32例艾滋病病毒感染者
    控制性传播疾病是预防艾滋病的关键
    本报北京12月1日讯　记者艾笑报道：记者从今天在首都举行的“世界艾滋病日”报告会上获悉：性病在我国的再度流行蔓延，严重地威胁着我国人民的身心健康，也是造成艾滋病传入我国最主要的危险因素。通过控制性传播疾病来预防艾滋病，是我国目前预防控制艾滋病传播的关键。
    除1985年6月以来我国发现的3例艾滋病国外传入病例外，现全国通过监测还发现29例艾滋病病毒感染者（北京市有14人，占46％），其中4例为国内血友病患者因注射进口血液制品而感染，1例为北京市性病病人，1例为赴非洲援外回国人员，其余23例均为外国人。
    报告会提供的材料指出，从80年代初到今年6月底，全国累计报告性病数204077例，遍布全国30个省、自治区、直辖市。今年上半年的发病率比去年同期增加了105.16％。我国近年性病发病情况的特点是，农村病人增加；儿童患者增加；相对于高危人群的普通人群性病隐匿感染不断发生。
    出席报告会的专家呼吁：只有在各级政府领导下，各有关部门和群众团体共同努力对社会环境进行综合治理，才能铲除性病、艾滋病发生和流行的根源。
