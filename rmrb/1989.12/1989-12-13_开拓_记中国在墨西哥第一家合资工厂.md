Pioneering – A Record of China's First Joint-Venture Factory in Mexico

On November 29, the "Shanghai-Mexico Garment Manufacturing Co., Ltd." officially opened in Mexico City. This marks a new development in economic cooperation between China and Mexico, as well as a new step taken by Shanghai entrepreneurs in expanding into the international market.

This achievement was hard-won, embodying the joint efforts of entrepreneurs from both China and Mexico. Two years ago, Wang Shusai, the general manager of the Shanghai Garment Company, led a team to Mexico to survey the market and investment environment. They discovered that Mexico not only provides various conveniences for foreign investment but also, due to its unique geographical advantages, serves as an ideal hub connecting the developed countries of North America with the developing countries of Central and South America. This sparked an innovative idea among Shanghai entrepreneurs. As a powerful enterprise, the Shanghai Garment Company has over 140 joint ventures across the country and has already introduced capital from the United States, Japan, and Hong Kong for joint ventures. Many of its products are renowned in the domestic market and are also exported to over 100 countries through joint ventures and foreign trade channels. To establish a truly outward-looking enterprise, the Shanghai Garment Company decided to invest in Mexico to set up a factory, directly grasping the pulse of the international market.

Last October, an advance team arrived in Mexico. Unfortunately, things did not go smoothly, as the initially chosen partner backed out. With the support of the Chinese Embassy in Mexico, and the assistance of Mexican friends, including Dr. Ortega, an advisor to the Mexican President, the advance team started anew. They selected the powerful "Isaac Saba Textile Group" as their new partner, embarking on a challenging entrepreneurial journey. To save money and achieve more with less, two members of the advance team did not stay in hotels but lived with local students, making do with modest accommodations to prepare for the factory setup. A new agreement was reached. The advance team then worked with their partners to secure the factory site and receive the machinery. They did not take taxis but used public transportation and the subway, working diligently. As the new factory began renovations, the advance team moved into the dormitories far from the city. At that time, the gas pipeline had not been connected, so they endured 10 days of eating bread and dry rations, "withering away for the cause." Finally, the 2,800-square-meter factory was renovated, and the machinery was delivered. The subsequent team of four, along with the machinery installation team, arrived. Everyone worked together, and in just 20 days, they installed and debugged all 231 machines, including cutting, sewing, buttoning, ironing, and packaging equipment. As the factory prepared to start operations, Shanghai sent management and technical personnel, including experts in production, operations, technology, and quality, as well as senior engineers, designers, and technicians, to establish a comprehensive scientific management system. Then, they recruited workers, set up assembly lines, determined the initial projects, purchased raw materials and auxiliary materials, and got to work.

The factory is located 40 kilometers from the city. Management personnel would go into the city every day to handle work, procurement, and negotiations, often working until sunset and beyond. To start production and generate profits quickly, they broke the rules by training new workers on the assembly line while producing. They also simplified production processes and broke down complex actions; first, they tackled the front-end processes and then the back-end processes, enabling workers with no prior experience to quickly master assembly line operations. On the first day, they produced products. The first batch of 32 workers, under the guidance of Chinese technical experts, produced 200 shirts on the second day and increased production to 500 shirts by the fourth day. Now, the factory's two assembly lines with 80 workers produce 800 shirts per day. These workers have only been in the factory for over a week. Next, the factory will produce men's and women's jeans, sportswear, children's clothing, and fashionable clothing, and will also feedback international fashion trends to the domestic market. They not only want to establish a foothold for "Shanghai-Mexico Garment Company" products in the Mexican and surrounding countries' markets but also aim to create a brand. This is the wish of entrepreneurs from both China and Mexico. The chairman of the joint-venture factory, Mr. Alberto Saba, said that this is just the first step in cooperation between the two countries' entrepreneurs. With the first step, there will be a second and third step. As the Mexican proverb goes: "Wishes are power." The strong desire shown by entrepreneurs from both China and Mexico from the start of their cooperation will inspire them to continue pioneering.

    开拓
　　——记中国在墨西哥第一家合资工厂
    本报记者　郭伟成
    11月29日，“上海墨西哥服装制作有限公司”在墨西哥城正式开业，这是中墨两国经济合作的新发展，也是上海企业家在向国际市场开拓中迈出的新步伐。
    这一步来之不易，凝结着中墨两国企业家的共同心血。2年前，上海市服装公司总经理王树塞带队来墨西哥考察市场及投资环境。了解到墨西哥不仅对外来投资给予种种便利，而且还由于地理环境得天独厚，连接着北美洲发达国家与中南美洲的发展中国家，是一个理想的商品集散地，由此引发了上海企业家一个开拓性的设想。作为一家实力雄厚的大企业，上海市服装公司在全国各地拥有140多家联营厂，并且已经先后引进美国、日本、香港资本合营，许多产品不仅在国内市场久负盛名，而且通过合营及外贸渠道，销往100多个国家。为了创办真正的外向型企业，上海市服装公司决定在墨西哥投资办厂，直接把握国际市场的脉搏。
    去年10月，先遣组来到了墨西哥。想不到好事多磨，原先物色的合作伙伴打了退堂鼓。在中国驻墨西哥大使馆的支持下，由墨西哥友好人士、现任总统顾问奥尔特加博士搭桥，先遣组另起炉灶，选定实力雄厚的墨西哥“伊沙克·萨瓦纺织集团”作为新的合作伙伴，开始了一个艰苦创业的历程。为了节约资金，用较少的钱尽量办出更多的事业，先遣组2位同志不住旅店，和留学生一样住进了墨西哥房东家，因陋就简，筹备办厂。一个新的协议达成了。先遣组又忙着与合作伙伴一起落实厂址，接收机器设备。他们不搭出租车，挤公共，钻地铁，艰苦奋斗。新厂房开始整修，先遣组又住进远离市区的厂区宿舍。当时，煤气管道还没接通，他们足足啃了10天面包、干粮，“为伊消得人憔悴”。终于，2800平方米的厂房整修好了，一台台机器运到了，后续4人与随后的机器安装小组也赶到了。大家劲往一处使，团结协作，仅仅20天就把231台机器，包括裁剪、缝纫、锁钉、整烫包装设备等全部安装调试完毕。开工在即，上海又派出管理及技术人员，其中包括生产、经营、技术、质量等各方面管理专家、高级工程师、设计师、技师，建立一整套科学管理体系。然后，招工，排定流水生产线，确定首先上马项目，采购原料、辅料，热气腾腾地干起来。
    工厂离市区40多公里，管理人员进城联系工作、采购、洽谈，天天忙到太阳下山、星星上阵。为了早投产、早出效益，他们打破常规，在流水线上对新工人边培训、边生产，同时，简化生产工序，分解复杂动作；先攻前道工序，再克后道工序，使原先毫无基础的工人迅速掌握了流水线作业技能，第1天就出产品。首批32名工人在中国技术专家指导下，第2天生产出200件衬衫，第4天增加到500件。现在，工厂2条流水线80名工人，日产衬衫已达800件，而他们只不过是刚进厂一个多星期的工人。下一步，工厂将生产男女牛仔裤、运动服、童装、流行时装，并把国际流行款式反馈到国内去，不但要使“上海墨西哥服装公司”的产品在墨西哥及周围国家的市场上站住脚，而且要打出名气、创出牌子。这是中墨两国企业家的愿望。合资厂的董事长阿尔贝托·萨瓦先生说，这只是两国企业家合作的第一步。有了第一步，就会有第二步、第三步。正如墨西哥谚语所说：愿望就是力量。中墨两国企业家从合作开始就表现出的这一强烈愿望，将激励他们不断开拓。（附图片）
