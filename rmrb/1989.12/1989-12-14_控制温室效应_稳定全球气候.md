The Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, Godfrey Oba, issued a warning in November: By the year 2020, the Earth's temperature is estimated to rise by 4 degrees Celsius, which will have serious consequences for the ecological balance of humanity.

Prior to this, British scientists had discovered that the Arctic ice layer had significantly thinned over the past 10 years. They believe this may be due to the greenhouse effect causing global warming. According to the renowned ice physicist Peter Wadhams, British nuclear submarines used sonar to measure the ice thickness in the region north of Greenland and found that the average ice thickness had decreased from 6-7 meters in 1976 to 4-5 meters in 1987.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recent research report also clearly states that to control the greenhouse effect and stabilize atmospheric temperatures, at least 50% of carbon dioxide and other gas emissions must be reduced. Environmental experts have repeatedly warned that if the emission of harmful gases continues to increase at the current rate, the Earth's surface temperature will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Celsius in the next 40 years, causing the polar ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise, thus painting a grim picture: the deltas of the Ganges, Nile, and Mississippi rivers will be submerged by seawater; many islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, such as the Maldives, Tuvalu, Tonga, Kiribati, and Marshall Islands, will cease to exist; seawater will also cover 30% of Tokyo, Japan, and 10-20 million people in Bangladesh will lose their homes and livelihoods, while the Netherlands, bordering the North Sea, will disappear from the Earth.

Indeed, these are events that may occur in the future, but currently, due to the greenhouse effect causing global warming (by 1985, the temperature had already risen by 1.8-4.5 degrees Celsius over the past 100 years), people have felt its effects and it is worsening the ecological environment and threatening humanity. For example, in the past 10 years, there have been 4 of the warmest years on record (1980, 1981, 1983, and 1987). Meanwhile, severe droughts and floods have occurred in various regions around the world; desert areas are expanding; many plants, animals, and insects are migrating to adapt to climate changes, and some are inevitably being destroyed... All of this will inevitably have adverse effects on agriculture, fisheries, coastal ecosystems, wildlife, river transportation, and the supply of water and energy resources. Broadly speaking, developing countries, with their weak economic foundations, underdeveloped agriculture, and lack of necessary technology, will pay a much higher price than developed countries.

Therefore, this phenomenon has attracted close attention worldwide in recent years and sparked heated discussions. This year, experts from various countries have held numerous regional and international conferences to discuss countermeasures to maintain the ecological environment. At the beginning of last month, ministers from 68 countries gathered in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, for an international conference on atmospheric pollution and global warming. The conference unanimously adopted a declaration stating: "Humanity is changing the Earth at an unprecedented rate, and human society is threatened by the global climate it has changed," so "it is necessary to stabilize the release of carbon dioxide and other gases in this world." The declaration also urged industrialized countries to limit or reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to reduce them by 20% by 2005.

Now, controlling the greenhouse effect and preventing global warming have become urgent matters for the world. The immediate task is to stabilize the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by various countries and to reduce it as quickly as possible. To this end, the energy structure can be changed, gradually shifting from traditional mineral fuels to renewable energy sources (solar energy, wind power, hydropower, and solar power generation) and nuclear energy that reduce the greenhouse effect. Secondly, improving energy efficiency and saving energy can also reduce carbon dioxide emissions, thereby mitigating the greenhouse effect and preventing global warming. In addition, expanding the effective use of public transportation in various countries can also have a similar effect.

To protect humanity from the massive disasters caused by ecological collapse, each country should and must take measures within its capabilities to prevent potential dangers. This is an unavoidable responsibility. However, it should be noted that since the Industrial Revolution, developed countries have far outpaced developing countries in the consumption of mineral energy, bearing an undeniable responsibility for human-induced global warming. They also possess sufficient financial resources and advanced technology and equipment. Therefore, developed countries should make greater efforts to prevent global climate change, which is only natural.

As Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney recently said at the World Energy Conference in Montreal: "Industrialized countries should particularly set an example in energy use and environmental protection, because most of the air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions come from industrialized countries."

    控制温室效应  稳定全球气候
    王士芳
    世界气象组织秘书长戈德温·奥巴西于11月发出警告：至2020年，地球气温估计将上升4摄氏度，这将在生态平衡方面给人类带来严重后果。
    在此前，英国科学家已发现，北极冰层10年来由于融化明显变薄。他们认为，这可能是温室效应引起地球气候变暖所致。据世界著名冰物理学权威彼得·瓦德哈姆斯博士宣布，英国核潜艇在格林兰以北地区的冰层下用声纳测量冰层厚度，发现冰层的平均厚度已从1976年的6—7米减至1987年的4—5米。
    美国环保局在其最近公布的研究报告中也明确指出，为控制温室效应，稳定大气温度，应至少减少50％的二氧化碳和其他气体的释放量。一些环保专家也一再警告：如果有害气体的释放量按照目前速度继续增加，在未来40年中地球表面温度将上升3至8摄氏度，引起两极冰帽融化，海平面上升，从而将给人们描绘出一幅难以想像的景象：恒河、尼罗河和密西西比河几个大三角洲被海水淹没；太平洋和印度洋的许多岛屿（国家），如马尔代夫、图瓦卢、汤加、基里巴斯、马绍尔群岛等不复存在；海水也将漫过日本东京30％的地面，孟加拉国有1000万—2000万人失去家园与生活来源，濒临北海的荷兰将从地球上消失。
    诚然，这虽是若干年后可能发生的事，但就目前来说，由于温室效应引起的气候变暖（至1985年为止的过去100年中，气温已上升1.8—4.5摄氏度），已被人们感觉到并也正在恶化生态环境威胁人类。例如，在以往10年中已出现4个最暖年份
  （1980、1981、1983和1987）。同时，在世界一些地区则不时发生严重的旱涝灾害；而且，沙漠地区由此不断扩大；许多植物、动物和昆虫出现迁移现象，以适应气候变化，有的也难免被毁灭……这一切对农业、渔业、沿海生态系统、野生生物、河流运输以及水资源与能源的供应势必产生不良影响。广大发展中国家由于经济基础薄弱、农业欠发达和缺乏必要的技术，它们将为此付出远比发达国家更大的代价。
    因此，这一现象近年间已引起全世界的密切关注并就此展开热烈讨论。今年来，各国有关专家已相继开过不少地区性和国际性会议，商讨对策，以维护生态环境。上月初，68个国家的有关部长在荷兰诺德威克召开国际大气污染和气候变暖会议。会议一致通过宣言说：“人类正在以前所未有的速度改变着地球，人类社会正受到自己所改变的全球气候的威胁”，所以，“有必要稳定本世界二氧化碳和其他气体的释放量”。这项宣言还敦促工业化国家限制或降低二氧化碳释放量并到2005年减少20％。
    现在，控制温室效应，防止气候变暖，已成为全世界刻不容缓的事。当务之急是稳定各国向大气排放的二氧化碳释放量，并尽可能快地减少。为此，可以改变能源结构，从传统的矿物燃料逐步转向减少温室效应的再生能源（太阳能、风能、水力发电和太阳能发电等）与核能。其次，提高能源利用率和节能，也能减少二氧化碳释放量，从而减轻温室效应，防止气候变暖。此外，扩大各国公共交通工具的有效利用率，也可以起到同样作用。
    为保护人类免遭生态失控造成的巨大灾难，各国应该也必须采取力所能及的措施以防患于未然。这是责无旁贷的。但应该指出，自工业革命迄今，发达国家的矿物能源消耗一直远远领先于发展中国家，对人为气候的变暖负有不容置疑的责任。而它们又拥有足够的财力和先进的技术及设备，因此，发达国家应为防止全球气候变暖作出更大努力，这也是理所当然的。
    正如加拿大总理马尔罗尼不久前在蒙特利尔举行的世界能源大会上说的：“工业化国家尤其应该在使用能源和环境保护方面作出榜样，因为，污染空气和二氧化碳大部分是工业化国家施放的”。
