Attending local markets has become an essential part of life for ethnic minorities in the border regions of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou. This practice is driving the development of the local commodity economy: agricultural and sideline products from the southwest are entering the more developed eastern regions, while industrial products from the east are flowing into the border regions of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou, and from there into the greater southwest. According to incomplete statistics, over 1,000 markets, large and small, have been established in the border regions of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou, linking remote mountainous ethnic minorities with the outside world.

The border regions of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou include seven prefectures and cities, which are among the largest poverty-stricken areas in the country. The over 7 million Tujia, Miao, Dong, Yao, and other ethnic minorities living here all have the tradition of attending markets for trade. In recent years, local authorities have prioritized the construction of trade markets as a key measure to alleviate poverty, leading to the rapid development of ethnic border trade. The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has invested over 30 million yuan in the past four years to build 96 new agricultural markets, ensuring that every township has a market. They are gradually transforming roadside markets into regular markets and agricultural markets into comprehensive markets.

The neighboring regions of the four provinces have broken free from the mindset and institutional constraints of isolationism and self-seclusion, opening up to the outside world. They have opened their mountain gates, removed regional blockades, dismantled illegal checkpoints, and allowed goods to flow naturally into circulation.

    山区少数民族与山外联为一体
    湘鄂川黔边贸活跃
    本报长沙12月23日电　记者杜若原报道：赶墟正成为湘鄂川黔边区少数民族同胞生活的重要内容，它推动着当地商品经济的发展：西南的农副产品进入东部发达地区，东部的工业品大量涌入湘鄂川黔边区，并由此流向大西南。据不完全统计，湘鄂川黔边区已建起大小1000多家市场，它们将偏远山区的少数民族与山外的世界联为一体。
    湘鄂川黔边区包括7个地州市，是国内较大的贫困区域。生活在这里的700多万土家、苗、侗、瑶等少数民族同胞，都有赶场交易的传统。近年来，边区各地把贸易市场建设作为脱贫的重要工作来抓，促进民族边贸很快发达起来。湘西土家族苗族自治州，4年投入3000多万元，新建96个农贸市场，基本做到乡乡有市场，并逐步使马路市场变成正规市场，农贸市场变成综合市场。
    四省毗邻地区冲破以邻为壑、闭关自守的观念和体制束缚，对外开放，纷纷打开山门，破除地区封锁，撤掉违章关卡，商品按照自然流向进入流通。
