Title: New Vitality in the Red Pine "Family"

Longshan Mountain is the birthplace of the red pine. In recent years, on this ancient "family's" logging grounds, patches of green, tall, and orderly "new members" have emerged. Wang Mingxuan, the Party Secretary of Linjiang Forestry Bureau, told us: "These are the red pine reserves we have cultivated using artificial management methods. Currently, the average tree height is 14 meters, with a diameter at breast height of 20 centimeters, and each mu (a unit of area) has a volume of 12 cubic meters. In another 20 years, they will be ready for logging, and the average yield per mu can exceed that of natural red pine forests."

Red pine is a famous precious tree species in China, with a growth cycle of over a hundred years. It has always been considered difficult to plant and care for, akin to a "noble" tree. Now, not only have they been successfully planted and grown into forests in Linjiang Forestry Bureau, but they have also spread to 248,000 mu, making this large "family" even more prosperous.

Linjiang Forestry Bureau is located at the southern foot of Longshan Mountain and is one of the 17 state-owned forestry bureaus in the Longshan Mountain forest area. As early as the 1980s, when the winds of reform first blew into the deep forests, the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department had a new plan: Longshan Mountain is an old forest area, where in the past, only logging was done without reforestation. The old resources were quickly depleted, and new resources could not keep up, facing the danger of resource depletion and no successor forests. They required each forestry bureau to adjust their management strategies, prioritize forestry work, use artificial forests to supplement natural forests, and use new resources to restore old forest areas.

Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, ten years have passed. The foresighted decision made by the forestry department at that time is now beginning to bear its first fruits. By September 1989, the entire forest area had planted over 5 million mu of new forests, including red pine, fir, spruce, larch, and Korean pine. They also tended to over 10 million mu of young and middle-aged forests. The rise of new forests not only cleared the debt of updating over 1 million mu of forest land but also ensured that new forests keep up with logging.

Creating high-standard artificial forests is no easy task. First, it requires high investment. As the old generation of forest resources gradually dwindles, logging volume is repeatedly reduced, and economic income also decreases. While the cost of afforestation increases, forestry work often faces financial constraints. What to do without money? The forestry workers of the Longshan Mountain forest area do not wait or rely on others. They rely on the family treasure of hard work to solve the problem. With the belief of "tightening our belts to plant reserve forests," they raise funds through methods such as "retaining, requesting, squeezing, borrowing, and supplementing." Some workers even use their bonuses to plant forests. After several years of hard work, they not only created large areas of artificial red pine forests but also planted an additional 1 million mu of artificial forests composed of other high-quality tree species. Last year, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun personally inscribed the words for their "1 million mu artificial forest" memorial.

In cultivating reserve resources, Wangqing Forestry Bureau reformed the "shaving bald" and "pulling out big hairs" operation methods, promoting the "logging and cultivation combined" method. This increased production costs, resulting in a reduction of over 50 million yuan in annual income. The cadres and workers of this bureau are willing to not receive or receive less bonuses, insisting on "eating half and leaving half" to balance long-term interests, successfully cultivating 1.02 million mu of high-quality forest land that can be operated in cycles.

The rise of large-scale artificial forests has brought new vitality to the Longshan Mountain forest area. In the past, there was a saying here, "The more big logs one cuts, the better." Over-logging and waste were severe. Now, the wind has changed, "The more artificial forests one plants, the more glorious." Planting more artificial forests and restoring old forest areas have become the new pursuit of the people of Longshan Mountain.

    红松“家族”的新活力
    章维
    长白山是红松的故乡。近些年，在这个古老“家族”的采伐地上，出现了一片片青翠挺拔、株行有序的“新成员”。临江林业局党委书记王明轩告诉我们：“这是我们用人工经营的办法培育出来的红松后备资源。现在平均树高14米，齐胸直径20厘米，每亩蓄积量12立方米。再过20年，它们就能采伐，平均每亩出材量可高于天然红松林。”
    红松是我国著名的珍贵树种，生长周期上百年，一向被视为难以栽植、难以侍候的“贵族”。如今，它们不但在临江林业局栽活了，成林了，而且山连山、片连片地发展到24.8万亩，使这个大“家族”更加兴旺发达起来。
    临江林业局位于长白山南麓，是长白山林区17个国营森工局中的一个。早在80年代初期，当改革之风刚刚吹进深山密林的时候，吉林省林业厅就有了新打算：长白山是老林区，过去只砍不造，老资源消耗得很快，新资源接替不上来，面临着资源断档，后继无林的危险。他们要求各森工局调整经营战略，把营林工作摆到第一位，用人工林弥补天然林，用新资源恢复老林区。
    光阴荏苒，转眼十年过去了，当初林业部门采取的富有远见的决策，现在开始收获第一批硕果。截至1989年9月，全林区已营造红松、云杉、冷杉、落叶松、樟子松等500多万亩新林，抚育了1000多万亩中幼林。新的森林的崛起，不仅还清了100多万亩林地更新的欠帐，而且实实在在地做到了更新跟上采伐。
    营造高标准人工林，谈何容易。首先是需要高投入。随着老一代森林资源日趋枯竭，采伐量一压再压，经济收入也随之减少。而造林成本增加，更使营林工作常捉襟见肘。没有钱怎么办？长白山林区的林业职工们一不等二不靠，硬是靠艰苦奋斗的传家宝解决问题。他们怀着“勒紧裤腰带也要造后备林”的信念，通过“留、要、挤、借、补”等办法筹集资金，有的职工把自己的奖金也拿出来造了林。经过几年艰苦努力，他们不仅搞成了大面积人工红松林，还另外营造了100万亩由其他优质树种组成的人工林。去年，田纪云副总理曾为他们的“百万亩人工林”纪念碑亲笔题词。
    汪清林业局在培育后备资源中，改革“剃光头”、“拔大毛”的作业方式，推行“采育兼顾法”，为此生产成本提高，每年少收入500多万元。这个局的干部、工人宁肯不拿、少拿奖金，也要“吃半碗留半碗”，兼顾长远利益，培育成功102万亩可以循环作业的优质林地。
    大面积人工林的兴起，给长白山林区带来新的活力。过去，这里流传一句话，“谁砍的大木头多谁就是好样的”，超砍滥采，浪费严重。如今风气变了，“谁造的人工林多谁光荣”。多造人工林，恢复老林区，成了长白山人新的追求。
