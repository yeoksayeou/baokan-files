Our reporters Cang Lide, Guo Weicheng, and Zhu Manting report from Washington, Mexico City, and Caracas:

Today at around 1 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), U.S. military forces suddenly surrounded and attacked the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces and several other targets. The Panamanian military engaged in fierce combat with the invading U.S. forces. Meanwhile, U.S. forces also launched an attack on Colón, Panama's second-largest city.

According to the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, 9 U.S. soldiers have been killed, 39 wounded, and 1 missing. The headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces was hit by artillery fire and caught on fire, and the whereabouts of Defense Forces Commander General Manuel Noriega are unknown.

According to news agencies quoting a Panamanian radio broadcast this morning, Noriega is still on the front lines directing the military to resist the U.S. forces. Panamanian government leaders have called on soldiers and militia through the radio to fight to defend national sovereignty.

According to local reports, at least 50 people have been killed and hundreds injured on the Panamanian side. Forty-plus American hostages have been detained by the Panamanian Defense Forces. The Panama Canal has been closed, marking the first time in 75 years that the canal has been shut down.

U.S. President George H.W. Bush delivered a televised address to the nation from the White House at 7:20 a.m. this morning, stating that this military action was ordered by him. The purpose is to protect the lives of U.S. military and civilians in the area, restore Panama's "democratic procedures," uphold the Panama Canal Treaty, arrest Noriega, and bring him back to the U.S. for trial. Bush said that, except for Noriega being "on the run," the main objectives have been achieved.

General Colin Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed that the U.S. initially deployed 13,000 troops in the area for this military operation, with an additional 7,000 troops from the Marine Corps and Airborne Division providing reinforcement. Currently, 2,500 military personnel are still en route to Panama to "stabilize the situation." During the battle, U.S. forces simultaneously attacked Panamanian civilian and military airports, fleets, prisons, barracks, and other targets. Several U.S. aircraft have crashed. Local sources generally believe that the U.S.'s main goal is to overthrow the Noriega regime and capture Noriega himself.

According to other reports, while U.S. forces were surrounding General Noriega's headquarters, Panamanian opposition leader Guillermo Endara, who participated in the May elections, declared himself president. The U.S. government immediately recognized Endara's government.

    美军入侵巴拿马
    巴政府号召人民保卫国家主权
    本报华盛顿、墨西哥城、加拉加斯12月20日电　记者仓立德、郭伟成、朱满庭报道：今日午夜1时许（美国东部标准时间），美国军队突然包围并袭击了巴拿马国防军司令部等多处目标。巴拿马军队与入侵美军发生激战。同时，美军还向巴拿马第二大城市科隆发动进攻。
    据美国参谋长联席会议主席鲍威尔宣布，美军已有9人死亡，39人受伤，1人失踪；巴拿马国防军司令部被炮火击中起火，国防军司令诺列加将军下落不明。
    据新闻机构援引巴拿马电台今晨广播说，诺列加仍在国内第一线指挥军队抗击美军。巴拿马政府领导人通过电台向军人和民兵发出呼吁，要求他们为保卫国家主权而战斗。
    据当地消息，巴拿马方面至少有50人死亡，数百人受伤。40余名美国人质被巴国防军扣押。巴拿马运河已经关闭。这是75年来巴拿马运河第一次关闭。
    美国总统布什今晨7时20分在白宫向全国发表电视演讲称，这次军事行动是他下令采取的，目的是保卫美国驻当地军民的生命安全，恢复巴拿马的“民主程序”，维护巴拿马运河条约，拘捕诺列加并把他押回美国审判。布什说，除诺列加“在逃”外，主要目标已经实现。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席鲍威尔将军透露，美国在这次军事行动开始时投入了当地1.3万美军，随后得到本土海军陆战队、空降师等7000名部队增援，现仍有2500名军事人员赶往巴拿马“稳定局势”。战斗中，美军对巴拿马民用和军用机场、舰队、监狱、兵营等同时展开进攻。数架美军飞机坠毁。此间人士普遍认为，美国的主要目的是推翻诺列加政权，抓获诺列加本人。
    另据报道，在美国军队包围诺列加将军的总指挥部的同时，巴拿马反对派领导人、5月份参加竞选的恩达拉宣布自己为总统，美国政府立即承认恩达拉的政府。
