Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th.

General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, and Premier of the State Council, Li Peng, visited the "Major Scientific and Technological Achievements of Beijing in the 1980s" exhibition on the evening of December 4th. Jiang Zemin said, "The Chinese people are intelligent; we should not belittle ourselves. We need to boost our national confidence. As long as everyone works together, the country's affairs will be easier to manage."

This exhibition is the largest-scale display of scientific and technological achievements in Beijing since the founding of the People's Republic. It showcases 829 major scientific and technological achievements in various fields such as industry, agriculture, urban construction, medicine and health, and high technology over the past decade. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, accompanied by Beijing Municipal Party Secretary Li Ximing and Mayor Chen Xitong, visited the exhibition hall. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng showed great interest in agricultural production technologies that have significantly contributed to Beijing's "rice bowl" and "vegetable basket" projects, as well as computer management technologies for urban planning.

When the staff introduced that Beijing has basically achieved computer management in areas such as finance, transportation, and population, Jiang Zemin specifically asked, "Does Beijing have an underground pipeline information system?" Li Ximing replied, "Yes, it does." Jiang Zemin said, "During my time working in Shanghai, I deeply felt that urban management cannot do without modernization. Beijing has developed relatively quickly in this regard." Li Peng carefully inquired about Beijing's agricultural production situation. Chen Xitong introduced, "In recent years, Beijing has implemented the policy of using science and technology to revitalize agriculture, achieving 12 consecutive years of grain increase, self-sufficiency in eggs, and a stable supply of vegetables at reasonable prices." Li Peng affirmed the work done by Beijing in vegetable supply and other aspects. At the New Technology Hall, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng listened to the introduction of technologies and products such as our 0286 microcomputer, bilingual typewriters, and titanium ion plating, which have been exported abroad, and nodded in approval. Li Peng also requested a copy of the new technological achievements in the field of power electronics.

During the visit, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng often stopped to exchange views with experts. Jiang Zemin said, "Socialist modernization construction cannot do without science and technology and education. We must focus our attention on these areas. Only by developing science and technology can we achieve twice the results with half the effort."

At the end of the visit, Jiang Zemin, satisfied, told Li Ximing and the surrounding crowd, "This exhibition is inspiring and makes one proud!"

    江泽民李鹏参观北京重大科技成果展时说
    只有发展科技才能事半功倍
    中国人是聪明的不要妄自菲薄要提高民族自信心
    新华社北京12月5日电  （记者黄威、潘善棠）中共中央总书记江泽民、国务院总理李鹏，4日晚兴致勃勃地参观了正在展出的《八十年代北京市重大科技成果展》。江泽民说，中国人是聪明的，不要妄自菲薄，要提高民族自信心。只要大家一齐努力，国家的事情就好办了。
    这次展览是建国以来北京市规模最大的一次科技成果大检阅，展示了首都10年来在工农业、城市建设、医药卫生、高新技术等方面取得的829项重大科技成果。江泽民、李鹏在北京市委书记李锡铭、市长陈希同的陪同下，相继来到展览大厅。江泽民、李鹏对为北京“米袋子”、“菜篮子”工程作出很大贡献的农业生产技术，城市计算机管理工程技术等兴趣很大。当工作人员介绍到北京在金融、交通、人口等方面已基本实现了计算机管理时，江泽民特意问：“北京有没有地下管网信息系统？”李锡铭回答说：“有”。江泽民说：“我在上海工作期间，深感城市管理不实现现代化是不行的。北京在这方面发展较快。”李鹏仔细地询问了北京市农业生产情况，陈希同介绍说：“北京近几年贯彻了科技兴农的方针，使粮食连续12年增产，鸡蛋实现自给，蔬菜供应充足，价格比较平稳。李鹏肯定了北京市蔬菜供应等方面所做的工作。在新技术馆，江泽民、李鹏听工作人员介绍了我们的0286微机、中外文打字机、钛金等离子镀膜等技术和产品已经出口国外之后，连连点头，表示赞许。李鹏还索要了一份关于电力电子方面的新技术成果资料。
    江泽民、李鹏在参观中，不时停下同专家交谈。江泽民说：“社会主义现代化建设离不开科技和教育，我们要把注意力集中在这方面。只有发展科技，才能取得事半功倍的效果。”
    参观结束时，江泽民满意地对李锡铭和周围群众说：“看了这个展览使人振奋，使人自豪！”
