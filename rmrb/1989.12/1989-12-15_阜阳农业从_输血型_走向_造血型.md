Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 14th.

In recent years, the Fuyang region of Anhui Province has focused on grain production by implementing a "dual-inclination" policy of science and technology and investment. By comprehensively utilizing local advantages, this region's agricultural production has quickly shifted from a "blood transfusion" type, relying on external aid, to a healthy and sustainable "blood generation" type. This year, the grain yield increased by over 40 million kilograms compared to last year.

Fuyang region has prioritized expanding the cultivation of high-yield crops and developing interplanting and intercropping as key strategies for grain development. Additionally, the region has organized specialized technical personnel to guide farmers in conducting vertical development in fields and forests.

    阜阳农业从“输血型”走向“造血型”
    据新华社合肥12月14日电　（记者陈先发）安徽省阜阳地区，近几年围绕粮食生产实施科技和投入的“双倾斜”政策，综合利用本地的优势资源，使这个地区的农业生产很快从“一等二靠三要”的“输血型”走向势头健康、后劲充足的“造血型”。今年粮食产量比去年净增4000多万公斤。
    阜阳地区把扩大高产作物种植和发展间混套种当作粮食开发的重点，同时还组织专门技术人员指导农民进行田间和林间的立体开发。
