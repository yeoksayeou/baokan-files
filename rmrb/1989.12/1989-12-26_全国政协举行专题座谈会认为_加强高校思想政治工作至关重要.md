Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th. (Reporter: Zou Aiguo) A report titled "Investigation Report on Ideological and Political Work Among Students in Beijing Universities," which was compiled over two months of investigation and research by the members of the Education and Culture Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was formally submitted to the thematic symposium of the second session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC for discussion today.

The thematic report proposed that after the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the overall social environment has improved, which is very beneficial for ideological and political education and management in universities. Currently, it is important to seize the favorable opportunity and good starting point, and to persistently carry out comprehensive governance from both the macro social environment and the micro school environment.

Vice Chairman of the National CPPCC, Fang Yi, presided over the symposium held this afternoon at the CPPCC Hall. Vice Chairman of the Education and Culture Committee of the National CPPCC, Lu Ping, introduced the situation of the thematic investigation.

Fang Yi said that in recent years, strengthening moral education in schools and ideological and political education for students has attracted the attention of CPPCC members, who have repeatedly called for action at various CPPCC meetings. This spring and summer, the turmoil that developed from student unrest into a counter-revolutionary riot has caused deep reflection throughout society, making the investigation of student ideological and political work even more necessary and urgent.

Fang Yi said that strengthening ideological and political work among university students is not only related to the cultivation of college students but also has a significant impact on China's current and future development and stability. He hoped that the members would, in conjunction with the investigation report, freely express their opinions on this issue.

In September of this year, the Education and Culture Committee of the National CPPCC and the Education, Science, Culture, Health, and Sports Committee of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC formed a joint investigation team. They conducted investigations at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, and 8 other institutions, and listened to reports from the Propaganda Department, the State Education Commission, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The investigation team also held discussions with leaders, teachers, political workers, and students from various institutions and conducted individual interviews with people at various levels and from various aspects.

Lu Ping reported at the meeting that over the past decade, China's higher education, like other sectors, has made significant progress, cultivating a large number of talents for the cause of socialist modernization. These achievements should be fully affirmed. However, during the political turmoil of this spring and summer, some universities in Beijing became the epicenter and hardest-hit areas of the unrest.

Lu Ping said that during the investigation, it was found that higher education, under the influence of the macro environment, has made some mistakes. These mainly manifested in: a serious tendency to neglect moral education in the guiding ideology of running schools; some university party organizations, especially some grassroots organizations, showed signs of weakness and disintegration; some universities lacked strong leadership in ideological and political work; proletarian revolutionary principles were weakened in ideological and theoretical education; and university management was relatively lax.

Lu Ping, after analyzing the recent thoughts of university students, proposed that the mainstream of university teachers and students is good, and the ideological and political work team has made achievements and contributions. Our intellectuals, as a basic reliance for running socialist higher education and developing science, culture, and modernization, are generally reliable. This should be evaluated in a realistic, comprehensive, and correct manner. Only by genuinely learning from past mistakes and doing a good job can our higher education cause be full of hope. Failing to see the severity and urgency of the problem will lead to blind optimism and new mistakes; failing to see our advantages and favorable aspects will lead to inaction and pessimism, both of which should be firmly avoided.

Lu Ping said that, in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on calmly summarizing the past and considering the future, during the investigation and discussion process, we felt that there are several major issues that need to be seriously reflected upon: in the implementation of the guiding ideology, serious mistakes have occurred; for a period of time, ideological and theoretical work and ideological and cultural work were neglected; efforts to strengthen party building were insufficient, and general calls were made without solid work and noticeable results.

Lu Ping proposed eight suggestions for strengthening ideological and political work in the report, including: clearly stipulating the legal status of political and ideological education in socialist education in education legislation; resolutely implementing legal sanctions against actions that seriously harm the education cause and the physical and mental health of young people, so that school education work can be carried out in accordance with the law; timely responding to issues that the people and young students are concerned about, especially addressing theoretical answers to some ideological knots, difficulties, and hotspots, and compiling high-quality political theory course textbooks that are suitable for universities, which adhere to the basic principles of Marxism and are closely linked to social and student realities.

Vice Chairpersons of the National CPPCC, Gu Mu, Yang Jingren, Kang Keqing, Wang Guangying, Qu Wu, Ma Wenrui, Qian Weichang, Sun Xiaocun, Cheng Siyuan, and Qian Zhengying attended the symposium.

### 全国政协举行专题座谈会认为  加强高校思想政治工作至关重要

    全国政协举行专题座谈会认为
    加强高校思想政治工作至关重要
    新华社北京12月25日电　（记者邹爱国）一份经过两个月的调查研究，凝结全国政协教育文化委员会委员心血的《北京高校学生思想政治工作调查报告》，今天正式提交七届全国政协第二次常委专题座谈会讨论。
    专题报告提出，中共十三届四中、五中全会以后，社会大环境有所改善，对高校的思想政治教育和管理工作十分有利。当前要把握有利时机和良好起点，从社会大环境和学校小环境两方面，坚持不懈地进行综合治理。
    全国政协副主席方毅主持了今天下午在全国政协礼堂举行的座谈会。全国政协教育文化委员会副主任陆平介绍了专题调查情况。
    方毅说，最近几年，加强学校德育工作，加强学生思想政治教育的问题引起了政协委员的关注，多次在政协的各种会议上发出呼吁。今年春夏之交，由学潮发展成的动乱直至反革命暴乱，引起了全社会的深刻反思，也使学生思想政治工作的调查更显得必要和迫切。
    方毅说，加强高校学生思想政治工作不仅关系到对大学生的培养，而且与我国当前以及今后若干年的发展、稳定关系极大。希望委员们结合调查报告，对这个问题畅所欲言，发表意见。
    今年9月，全国政协教育文化委员会和北京市政协教科文卫体委员会组成联合调查组，对北京大学、清华大学、中国人民大学等11所院校进行了调查，并听取了中宣部、国家教委、团中央等单位的情况介绍。调查组还和各院校领导、教师、政工干部、学生进行了座谈，对各层次、各方面的人员作了个别访问。
    陆平在会上介绍说，十年来，我国高等教育同其他各项事业一样，取得了长足的发展，为社会主义现代化事业培养了大批人才，成绩应该充分肯定。但是，在今年春夏之交的政治风波中，北京部分高校成了这场动乱的引发点和重灾区。
    陆平说，我们在调查中看到，高校教育在大环境的不良影响下，出现了一些失误。主要表现在：在办学指导思想上存在着严重忽视德育的倾向；有些高校党的组织，尤其是部分基层组织存在着软弱涣散现象；部分高校思想政治工作缺乏强有力的领导；在思想教育和理论教育方面，无产阶级的革命原则性被削弱了；高校管理比较松懈等。
    陆平在分析了近年来高校学生的思想后提出，高校教师和学生的主流是好的，思想政治工作队伍是有成绩、有贡献的。我们的知识分子队伍，作为办好社会主义高等教育，发展科学文化和现代化事业的一支基本依靠力量，总的来说，是可以信赖的。对此应有一个实事求是的、全面正确的估价。只要切实吸取教训，做好工作，我们的高等教育事业是大有希望的。看不到问题的严重性、紧迫性，就会盲目乐观，酿成新的失误；看不到我们的优势和有利面，就会陷入无所作为和悲观主义，这都是应当坚决避免的。
    陆平说，根据邓小平同志关于冷静地总结过去，考虑未来的讲话精神，我们在调查和研讨的过程中，感到有几个事关重大的问题，需要认真反思：在指导思想的贯彻实施上，出现了严重失误；在一个时期内，忽视了思想理论和意识形态工作；在加强党的建设方面着力不够，满足于一般号召，工作不扎实，效果不显著。
    陆平在报告中提出了加强思想政治工作的8点建议，其中有：在教育立法中，明确规定政治思想、道德教育在社会主义教育中的法律地位；对严重损害教育事业、严重损害青少年身心健康的行径坚决实行法律制裁，使学校教育工作走上依法办事的轨道；对当前人民群众和青年学生所关心的问题，特别是对一些思想扣子和疑点、难点、热点要及时作出反应，给予理论上的解答，并编写出既坚持马克思主义基本原理，又联系社会实际和学生的思想实际的，高水平的，适合于高校的政治理论课的教材；要进一步端正办学指导思想，把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，明确思想政治工作在高校的地位和作用，不管实行何种体制，都要绝对保证党的政治核心作用，保证党对思想政治工作实行全面领导。
    全国政协副主席谷牧、杨静仁、康克清、王光英、屈武、马文瑞、钱伟长、孙晓村、程思远、钱正英，参加了座谈会。
