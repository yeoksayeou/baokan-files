This year has been a tumultuous one in British politics. Not only have there been two unprecedented government reshuffles, but the main opposition party, the Labour Party, has also taken on an unprecedented "combat stance" to challenge the Conservative Party's hold on 10 Downing Street. Even within the Conservative Party, for the first time in 14 years, someone has publicly challenged Mrs. Thatcher's leadership. All of this has put "Thatcherism" under severe challenge.

Mrs. Thatcher is the first female Prime Minister in British history and the only one this century to serve two consecutive terms. She is also the only politician to have an "ism" named after her. The guiding principles of "Thatcherism" emphasize the role of the market mechanism, reducing state intervention; and within the bounds of the law, emphasizing individual initiative and responsibility. Due to the success brought by "Thatcherism," Mrs. Thatcher has gained a reputation and was once hailed as the "pioneer of Western economic recovery."

"Thatcherism" will undoubtedly leave its mark on British history, but it is not a panacea. Even in areas where the "Thatcher Revolution" has achieved "decisive success," there are now signs of "relapse" and challenges.

Firstly, inflation has risen again. Controlling inflation was the primary goal of "Thatcherism's" economic policy. This policy successfully reduced the inflation rate from 21.9% in 1980 to 2.4% in 1986, making Britain the country with the lowest inflation rate in the West. However, since the end of 1987, inflation has risen again, reaching 8.3% in June this year. To curb inflation, the British government has had to raise interest rates 13 times in 15 months since last June. In October, the base rate reached 15%. Currently, Britain has the highest inflation rate and interest rates among major Western industrialized countries. Last year, Britain's trade deficit was 14.27 billion pounds, setting a historical record.

Secondly, privatization has also faced significant obstacles. The Thatcher government vigorously promoted "popular capitalism," selling off large state-owned enterprises such as British Steel to private hands, which had a positive effect on improving production efficiency. However, when the government attempted to further privatize public services such as healthcare, waterworks, and power plants, it faced strong public opposition. The government had to adjust its policies in these areas, announcing that there would be "no privatization" in these sectors, and also delaying the privatization of nuclear power plants.

Thirdly, the Thatcher government's restrictions on trade unions had significantly reduced strikes, stabilized social life, and improved the investment environment. However, since the beginning of this year, strike waves have been on the rise, with nationwide strikes occurring in various industries.

Fourthly, in reforming social welfare, culture, education, and local taxation, Mrs. Thatcher has also faced difficulties. A recent opinion poll showed that two-thirds of people oppose the implementation of the "poll tax." Considering public sentiment, the government made some concessions, agreeing to refund overpaid taxes by the end of the year based on actual income for the year.

Additionally, there has been much criticism of "Thatcherism's" European policy. Last year, Lawson, who was selected by the European Monetary Magazine as the "best finance minister in the world," resigned because of disagreements with the Prime Minister on European policy. Many MPs are concerned that the Prime Minister's negative stance on European policy will cause Britain to miss the "European train" again and become an "outsider" in European affairs.

There are different explanations for why "Thatcherism" is facing challenges. Supporters of the Conservative Party believe that this is a common phenomenon in the "mid-term" of a government and not something to be overly concerned about.

However, many people believe that this challenge to Thatcherism is not "groundless." In recent opinion polls, the Labour Party, after several years of policy review and adjustment, has consistently led the Conservative Party by more than 10 percentage points. This reflects, to some extent, the public's "fatigue" with Mrs. Thatcher's leadership style and "Thatcherism." Additionally, the government's push for market economics principles and privatization in public services such as education, healthcare, and waterworks has gone too far, and the public believes that "the policy has gone too far." The implementation of the "poll tax" is also seen by many as a "disaster." Furthermore, Mrs. Thatcher's European policy has also been criticized. Her European policy's starting point is that the purpose of joining the European Community is primarily to reduce or eliminate Britain's economic difficulties and not to lose national sovereignty, allowing "socialism to enter through the back door." This is the reason for the frequent disputes between Mrs. Thatcher and the European Community countries in recent years. Of course, the most important reason for the challenges facing Thatcherism is that the economy is currently "on the brink of recession." High-interest rates, especially high mortgage rates, have caused complaints among homebuyers in the Conservative Party's heartland, the southeast of England. It seems that the British economy can only be adjusted at the junction of economic liberalism and state interventionism.

How will Mrs. Thatcher deal with these challenges?

Although Mrs. Thatcher is facing the "biggest crisis in a decade," the "Iron Lady" has declared that she will lead the Conservative Party to win the next two general elections. Observers here analyze that Mrs. Thatcher has the experience of successfully defending "Thatcherism"; the current entire cabinet and most Conservative MPs still support her; the Conservative Party has a tradition of maintaining unity in times of political turmoil; recent opinion polls show that her stance of "giving up less sovereignty" on European issues is supported by the majority of British citizens; her active diplomatic activities on the international stage are also helpful for her to "rebuild her prestige" among voters. These factors may help Mrs. Thatcher and her "Thatcherism" cope with the challenges and lead the Conservative Party into the next general election.

Of course, the key to "Thatcherism" coping with challenges lies in how the British economy operates. The "Autumn Financial Statement" and the "Government Policy Agenda" give us a glimpse of "Thatcherism's" next move. Firstly, the Thatcher government still prioritizes controlling inflation, using a tight fiscal policy to break the usual budget and strive to reduce inflation to the lowest level among Western European countries. Secondly, improving the quality of life, appropriately increasing necessary public spending in basic public services such as healthcare and education, but opposing spending more in all areas. Thirdly, continue to restrain trade union power, oppose "wildcat" strikes. While supporting market adjustment, training, and research, protect and expand labor market reforms. Fourthly, while maintaining the current government's insistence on a liberal and outward-looking Europe, adopt a more positive attitude towards the European single market.

Since the 1970s, from Heath, Wilson, Callaghan to Mrs. Thatcher, each person has had their own "experiment" in the British economy. The "experiment" of "Thatcherism" has achieved relatively obvious success, removing the "sick man of Europe" label. However, "Thatcherism" cannot avoid "stop-and-go" policy adjustments and cannot fundamentally reverse the trend of the British economy's "stop-and-go" development.

### “撒切尔主义”面临挑战

    “撒切尔主义”面临挑战
    本报记者　陈特安
    今年是英国政坛风云突起的一年。不仅两次政府大改组为往年所未见，而且主要反对党工党也以前所未有的“战斗姿态”问鼎唐宁街十号，甚至在保守党内部，14年来第一次有人公开向撒切尔夫人的领袖地位挑战。这一切，使“撒切尔主义”面临严峻的挑战。
    撒切尔夫人是英国历史上第一位女首相，又是本世纪蝉联首相时间最长，唯一以个人的名字命名“主义”的政治家。“撒切尔主义”的主导思想是强调发挥市场机制的作用，减少国家干预；强调在法律允许范围内，发挥个人能动性和责任感。由于“撒切尔主义”带来的成功，撒切尔夫人从而赢得了声誉。一时间被称为“西方经济复苏的先驱”。
                  （一）
    “撒切尔主义”无疑将在英国历史上留下印记，但它毕竟不是“药到病除”的“万灵药丹”，甚至在“撒切尔革命”取得“决定性成功”的某些领域而今也在不同程度上“旧病复发”，受到挑战。
    首先是通货膨胀又回升。控制通货膨胀是“撒切尔主义”经济政策的首要目标。这项经济政策曾成功地把通货膨胀率从1980年21.9％降到1986年的2.4％，使英国跃居西方通货膨胀率最低水平的国家之列。然而，自1987年底以来，通货膨胀又回升，今年6月份年通货膨胀率高达8.3％。为了抑制通货膨胀，英国政府不得不自去年6月起，在15个月内接连13次提高利率，今年10月，基本利率达15％。目前英国的通货膨胀率和利率在西方主要工业国中是最高的，去年英国贸易赤字为142.7亿英镑，创历史最高纪录。
    其次，在推行私有化方面也阻力重重。撒切尔政府大力推行“大众资本主义”，把英国钢铁公司等大量国营企业出售给私人，对提高生产效率起了积极的作用。但当政府打算进一步在医疗卫生、自来水厂、发电厂等公共事业部门推行私有化时，就遭到了公众强烈的反对。政府不得不调整有关方面的政策，宣布在上述部门“永远不搞私有化”，同时还延迟推行核电厂私有化。
    第三，撒切尔政府限制了工会权力，曾明显使罢工减少、社会生活稳定，投资环境改善。但自今年初以来，罢工浪潮此起彼伏，全行业全国性罢工也时有发生。
    第四，在改革社会福利、文化教育和地方税制方面，撒切尔夫人也举步艰难。最近的一项民意测验表明，有2／3的人反对实行“人头税”。考虑到公众的情绪，政府作了一些让步，即答应到年底可根据本年度实际收入计算，退回多交的税款。
    此外，舆论对“撒切尔主义”的欧洲政策也怨言颇多。去年被欧洲货币杂志选为“全球最佳财长”的劳森挂冠而去，就是因为在欧洲政策上与首相有分歧。不少议员担心首相在欧洲政策上的消极立场会使英国又一次搭不上欧洲“班船”，成为欧洲事务的“局外人”。
                    （二）
      “撒切尔主义”之所以面临挑战，此间舆论有不同的解释。支持保守党的人认为，这是“执政中期”出现的常规现象，不必大惊小怪。
    但是，有不少人认为，对撒切尔主义的这场挑战，并非“空穴来风”，在近期的多次民意测验中，经过几年政策回顾和调整后的工党得到的支持率一直比保守党领先10个百分点以上。这多少反应出，公众对撒切尔夫人的领导作风及“撒切尔主义”的某种“厌倦情绪”。此外，政府在教育、医疗卫生、自来水厂等公共事业部门推行市场经济原则和私有化计划走得过远，公众认为“政策过了头”。实行“人头税”制也被许多人视为“灾难”。另外，撒切尔夫人的欧洲政策也受到批评。她的欧洲政策出发点是：参加欧洲共同体的目的首先在于减少或消除英国的经济困难，不能失去国家主权，让“社会主义从后门进入”英国。这正是近年来撒切尔夫人与欧洲共同体国家之间常有争议的原因。当然，撒切尔主义面临挑战的最重要的根源还在于目前经济正“接近衰退的边缘”。高利率，特别是高抵押利率政策已在保守党的心脏地带——英格兰东南地区的购房者中引起怨言。看来，英国经济只能在经济自由主义与国家干预主义两者的接合处进行调整。
                    （三）
    撒切尔夫人将如何对付挑战？
    尽管撒切尔夫人面临的是“十年来最大的危机”，但“铁夫人”还是宣告，她将带领保守党去争取赢得下两届大选。此间观察家分析，撒切尔夫人有捍卫“撒切尔主义”的成功经验；目前的全体内阁大臣和大多数保守党议员都还支持她；保守党在遇到政治风浪的时刻有保持团结的传统；最近的民意调查结果显示，她在欧洲问题上“少交出主权”的立场得到多数英国公民的支持；她在国际舞台上活跃的外交活动，也有利于她在选民中“重建威望”。上述因素，有可能便于撒切尔夫人及其“撒切尔主义”应付挑战，带领保守党进入下届大选。
    当然，“撒切尔主义”应付挑战的关键还在于英国的经济如何运作。“秋季财政声明”和“政府施政纲领”使我们看到“撒切尔主义”的下一步棋。其一，撒切尔政府仍然把控制通货膨胀放在“绝对优先”地位，用紧缩的财政政策打破常规的预算，力争把通货膨胀降到西欧国家最低水平之列。其二，改善生活质量，在医疗卫生、文化教育等基础公共事业部门适当增加必要的公共开支，但反对在一切领域多花钱。其三，继续约束工会权力，反对“野猫式”罢工。在支持市场调整、培训和研究的同时，保护和扩展劳动力市场的改革。其四，在维护目前政府坚持的一个外向型自由的欧洲的同时，对欧洲统一大市场持更积极姿态。
    70年代以来，从希思、威尔逊、卡拉汉到撒切尔夫人，英国经济中各人都有各人的“试验”。“撒切尔主义”的“试验”曾获得较明显的成功，摘掉了“欧洲病夫”的帽子。但“撒切尔主义”无法避免“走走停停”的政策调整，也无法根本扭转英国经济“走走停停”交替发展的趋势。
