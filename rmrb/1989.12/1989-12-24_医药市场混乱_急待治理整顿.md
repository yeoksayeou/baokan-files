Over the past two years, the pharmaceutical market in many places across the country has been in disorder. Many non-specialized entities have entered the pharmaceutical business, engaging in chaotic wholesale operations, allowing substandard drugs to flood the market and directly endangering the health and safety of the people. This situation urgently needs to be rectified and regulated.

Pharmaceuticals are special commodities that directly affect people's health. The state has strict requirements for the production and sale of drugs. However, some people, seeing the high profits in the pharmaceutical business, have violated relevant regulations and entered the pharmaceutical wholesale market. In Anhui Province's Fuyang region, there are 1,887 entities engaged in pharmaceutical sales, spanning over 20 industries including health, agriculture, taxation, commerce, education, and township enterprises. Many of these entities have shockingly poor operating conditions, lacking necessary storage equipment and basic testing capabilities. Drugs are often haphazardly piled up in unsanitary places, and some entities mix human and veterinary drugs. Due to the chaotic management, cases of producing and selling substandard drugs frequently occur. The region has handled over 180 cases of substandard drug production and sales in recent years. It is understood that similar problems exist in the pharmaceutical markets of Guangdong, Hunan, Hebei, Shanghai, and other provinces and municipalities. In Henan Province's Anyang City, over 100 entities near the railway station are engaged in drug sales, many of which do not meet the operating conditions.

The chaos in the pharmaceutical market has caused serious social harm. "Every industry deals in drugs," which has disrupted the main channels of state-owned drug sales and severely affected normal procurement. The nationwide rational inventory of drugs has decreased by about 50%, with over 200 types of drugs being out of stock. In the event of sudden disasters or epidemics, it would be difficult to guarantee the supply of urgently needed drugs.

"Every industry deals in drugs" has also disrupted drug prices in the market. Various parties compete to raise prices for scarce drugs, leading to uncontrollable price fluctuations in some regions. Some people take advantage of the chaos to evade taxes, making huge profits. Some have earned tens of millions, even hundreds of millions, from drug wholesaling in just a few years.

Why is the pharmaceutical market so chaotic? Experts analyze that the reasons are: first, there is insufficient understanding and poor management of this special commodity. Second, regulations are not perfect. Coordination and supervision among relevant departments are weak, allowing illegal activities to go unchecked. Third, the system is flawed, and the structure is incomplete. Multiple leaderships and dispersed management easily lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies and reliance issues.

The chaos in the pharmaceutical market has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the public. It is hoped that all levels of leadership will pay attention to this issue and take strong measures to rectify it.

    医药市场混乱  急待治理整顿
    本报记者　魏亚玲
    近两年来，全国许多地方医药市场秩序混乱。许多非专门单位插手经营药品，乱搞批发，使一些伪劣药品乘乱流入市场，直接危害人民群众健康和安全，亟需严加治理整顿。
    医药是特殊商品，关系到人民身体健康。国家对药品的制作和经营要求是十分严格的。然而，一些人看经营医药利润高，能赚钱，便违反有关规定，插手医药批发。安徽省阜阳地区经营医药的有1887家，遍及卫生、农牧、税务、工商、教育、乡镇企业等20多个行业，相当多的企业经营条件之简陋令人吃惊，既没有必要的储藏设备，也不具备起码的检测手段；药品随便堆放在很不卫生的地方；有的人药、兽药混营。由于经营混乱，制造、销售伪劣药案时有发生。该地区近年来已查处制售伪劣药品案180多件。据了解，广东、湖南、河北、上海等省市的医药市场也存在同类问题。河南省安阳市火车站附近一条街上就有100多家经营药品的单位，其中许多不具备经营条件。
    医药市场的混乱，造成严重的社会危害。“百业经药”，冲击了国营经药主渠道，严重影响了正常进货。全国医药合理库存下降了50％左右，脱销品种多达200多个。如遇突发的灾情或疫情，很难保证急需药品的供应。
    “百业经药”，搞乱了市场药品价格。对紧缺药品，各方竞相抬价。弄得有的地区药价暴涨暴跌，无法控制。有的人乘乱偷税漏税，发了大财。有的仅两三年就靠批发药品赚了几十万甚至上百万元。
    医药市场如此混乱，原因何在？有关专家分析认为：一是对医药这种特殊商品认识不足，管理不善。二是法规不完善。有关部门之间协调监督不力，使一些不法行为不能及时得到处理。三是体制不顺，机构不健全。多头领导，分散管理，容易形成扯皮、依赖现象。
    医药市场的混乱，已引起广大群众的不满。希望各级领导都能重视这个问题，采取强有力的措施予以整顿。
