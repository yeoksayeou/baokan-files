Jilin is one of China's main ginseng-producing regions. Now, at the foot of the old mountain range, a large-scale farm with diverse processing capabilities has emerged. Visitors exclaim: "Great! The Love Forest Ginseng Farm!"

During the ginseng harvesting season, we visited the Love Forest Ginseng Farm in Huinan County, Jilin. The car navigated through the undulating hills and slowly moved along the mountain paths. I looked at the ginseng still being harvested on the slopes and the deer in the enclosure, and I couldn't help but exclaim: "Great! The Love Forest Ginseng Farm!"

Hard Work and Innovation: A New Chapter

The Love Forest Ginseng Farm is located in the northeastern part of Sifangdingzi in Huinan County, at the foot of the old mountain range in the Longgang Mountain system of the Changbai Mountains. It is at the junction of four counties: Pan Shi, Huadian, Jingyu, and Huinan. The winter is long and cold, with snow accumulation reaching over half a meter, which is very beneficial for the growth of ginseng in the spring. Currently, the farm has basically embarked on the path of "multi-level comprehensive management, thriving through cooperation, and comprehensive development of agriculture, industry, and commerce." In 1986, it entered the ranks of enterprises with profits exceeding one million yuan.

The Love Forest Ginseng Farm was established in 1976. At that time, sixteen pioneers, with a small horse-drawn cart, a few picks, and handsaws, began their arduous entrepreneurial journey in the cold and desolate deep mountains. Living conditions were extremely harsh, with "treating the slopes during the day and treating the nests at night." They endured the three evils of the mountain valley: "small bites, grasshoppers, and stinging nettles." The entire factory's staff had no complaints. To this day, people still remember these rhymes: "Oilcloth houses with plastic windows, boiling white radish soup with clear water. Drinking flowing water, the heart is brighter." "The sky is a mirror, the stream is a basin, brushing teeth and washing faces makes the heart beautiful." "The small stream flows endlessly, innovation shines brightly. Building a new ginseng farm, what fear is there of hardship and toil."

These few rhymes vividly depict the scene of self-reliance and hard work in building the farm. In January 1977, the Huinan County Party Committee appointed the 31-year-old Cui Yishun as the Party Branch Secretary of the Love Forest Ginseng Farm. He first led the staff and workers to formulate the farm's construction plan and factory policy, building over 2,000 square meters of brick and wooden structures that year (including staff dormitories, schools, staff canteens, deer pens, and feed rooms, etc.). The farm's initial scale further inspired the staff and workers' entrepreneurial enthusiasm, and everyone decided to cultivate and irrigate this "treasure land" of ginseng with their own hands and sweat.

Today, the Love Forest Ginseng Farm has undergone a great transformation. In 1986, it signed a 20-year contract with the Toronto-based Chengfu Farm in Canada for the joint development of American ginseng. The county government approved the Love Forest Ginseng Farm as a natural reserve for animals and plants. Utilizing the farm's abundant raw materials, it established a pharmaceutical factory and a natural health product factory. According to the farm's needs for deep processing, a supporting color printing factory was newly built. In cooperation with ten townships and 300 households of farmers within the county, the ginseng planting area was developed to 130,000 square meters, providing sufficient raw materials for the pharmaceutical factory and the natural health product factory. This year's output value can reach 16 million yuan, with a taxable profit of 3 million yuan.

Advancing in the Breadth and Depth of Production

The continuous development of the commodity economy has put forward new requirements for the Love Forest Ginseng Farm: without deep processing of ginseng, the farm will have no future. Relying solely on the sale of raw materials, when will the enterprise become prosperous?

The farm's leadership decided to break away from traditional production and business methods, changing from single operation to "ginseng as the main focus, diversified operations, mutual complementation of various industries, and deep processing." In 1987, a pharmaceutical factory and a natural health product factory were built, and technical renovations were completed on the original ginseng processing plant. The deep processing and comprehensive utilization of ginseng and other medicinal plants began, producing five series of 35 varieties. In recent years, the deep processing and comprehensive utilization of ginseng have made this factory the largest ginseng processing plant in the county. The various ginseng and deer products they produce are always in high demand. The farm established the Dongji Ginseng and Deer Specialty Trading Company, which is responsible for the sales tasks of all ginseng and deer products in the farm. It has successively established more than 20 sales outlets and agencies in more than a dozen large and medium-sized cities across the country, including Jilin, Changchun, Jinxi, Beijing, Xiamen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai.

Developing the commodity economy requires not only policies and struggle but also scientific and technological progress. In recent years, they have successively hired and recruited more than 100 senior engineers, engineers, economists, accountants, pharmacists, agronomists, and other technical personnel from society, accounting for more than 10% of the total number of employees in the farm.

The Birth of a New Type of Joint Venture

It can be said that without this "farm-led household" joint form, there would be no economic prosperity for the Love Forest Ginseng Farm. The farm's leadership believes that state-owned ginseng farms should bear a dual responsibility: first, to develop themselves, and second, to use their financial and technological advantages to encourage nearby villagers to actively develop ginseng farming, walking the path of common prosperity. They have successively used three years to develop ginseng with farmers in ten nearby townships, beginning to disseminate technology and capital to farmers, and bearing the market risks for farmers. A new type of joint venture—"farm-led household"—was thus born. In the past three years, a total of 137 households have been developed for joint operations, with a ginseng green area of more than 150,000 square meters. This is such a huge ginseng base! To strengthen the management of farm-household joint operations, in addition to adhering to "focusing on support, benefiting the people"; "acting as the investment main body, organizing the supply of production materials"; "dispatching technical personnel to provide technical services to ginseng households," they also specially established the "Changbai Mountain Ginseng Huinan Joint Development Company" to be responsible for the management and service work of farm-household joint operations. The "farm-led household" form has brought economic benefits to ginseng farmers, broadening their horizons. When talking about the prospects of "farm-led household," farm director Cui Yishun said, next year, the number of joint households will reach 500, with an area of 500,000 square meters, utilizing 1,000 rural laborers, equivalent to establishing two more Love Forest Ginseng Farms.

    吉林是我国人参主要产地，如今，在老岭脚下平地“冒”出个经营面积大、加工门类多的农场，参观者说：
    好啊，爱林参场！
    焦忠义
    起参时节，我们去吉林辉南县爱林参场采访。汽车穿过绵延起伏的丘陵在山间小路上缓慢地行驶。我望着山坡上还没有起完的人参，望着鹿场里那一只只梅花鹿，情不自禁地赞叹：好啊，爱林参场！
    艰苦创业谱新篇
    爱林参场位于辉南县四方顶子东北部，地处长白山脉老龙岗山系的老岭脚下，是盘石、桦甸、靖宇、辉南四县交界的地方。冬季漫长而寒冷，积雪有半米多厚，对于春季的人参生长非常有利。目前，爱林参场已经基本走上了“多层次综合经营，靠联合繁荣，农工商全面发展”的道路，一九八六年跨入利润超百万元的行列。
    爱林参场是一九七六年开始创办的。当时，十六名拓荒者在冷漠荒凉的深山老林中，靠一挂小马车、几把镐头和手锯投入了艰苦的创业战斗。吃住条件十分艰苦，“白天治坡，晚间治窝”。经受着山沟里的三种害：“小咬、草爬子、螫麻子”。全厂干部职工没有怨言。至今人们还记得这样顺口溜：“油毡房盖塑料窗，清水煮熬白菜汤。喝着长流水，心里更亮堂。”“天作镜子溪为盆，刷牙洗脸心里美。”“小溪流不尽，创新发光辉。建设新参场，何惧苦与累。”
    这几段顺口溜比较典型地描绘了当时自力更生、艰苦奋斗建设参场的情景。一九七七年一月，辉南县委任命三十一岁的崔以顺同志为爱林参场党支部书记。他首先带领干部职工制订建场规划和建厂方针，当年盖起砖瓦结构和土木结构简易房二千多平方米（包括职工宿舍、学校、职工食堂、鹿舍、饲料室等）。参场的初具规模，进一步激发了干部职工的创业热情，大家决心用自己的双手和辛勤的汗水来耕耘和浇灌这片人参“宝地”。
    如今，爱林参场面貌大变，一九八六年同加拿大多伦多市诚富农场签定二十年联合开发西洋参的定期合同；县政府批准爱林参场为动植物自然保护区；利用参场原料十分丰富的优势，创办了制药厂和天然滋补品厂；根据参场精深加工的需要，新建了配套彩印厂；同县内十个乡镇的三百户农民联合发展人参种植面积一百三十万平方米，为药厂和天然滋补品厂，提供了充足的原料。今年产值可达一千六百万元，可上交利税三百万元。
      向生产的广度和深度进军
      商品经济的不断发展，给爱林参场提出了新的要求：人参不搞深加工，参场就没有后劲，光靠出售原料，企业何时才能富裕起来？
    场领导班子决心打破传统生产和经营方式，改单一经营为“以参为主，多种经营，各业互补，精深加工”，一九八七年，兴建了制药厂和天然滋补品厂，完成了对原人参加工场的技术改造。开始了对人参等药用动植物进行精深加工，生产出五个系列三十五个品种。这些年来，对人参的深加工和综合利用，已使这个厂成为全县吞吐人参量最大的加工厂。他们生产出的各种参鹿产品始终是十分畅销。该场设立的东吉参茸特产贸易公司，专门负责全场参鹿产品的销售任务，并先后在吉林、长春、锦西、北京、厦门、珠海、上海等十几个国内大中城市设立了二十几个销售网点和代销点。
    发展商品经济，既要靠政策、靠拚搏，还要靠科学技术进步。这些年来，他们先后从社会上聘请和录用了高级工程师、工程师、经济师、会计师、药剂师、农艺师及其他技术人员百余人，占全场职工人数的百分之十以上。
    一种新型联合体的诞生
    可以这样说，没有这种“以场带户”的联合形式，就没有爱林参场的经济繁荣。场领导班子认为，国营参场应该肩负着双重任务：一是要搞好自身的发展，二是要以自己的资金和技术优势，带动附近乡村的农民积极发展养参事业，走共同富裕的道路。他们先后用三年时间，同附近等十个乡镇的农民联合发展人参，开始向农民扩散技术和资金，替农民承担市场风险，一种新型的联合体——“以场带户”就这样地诞生了。三年来，一共发展联营一百三十七户，人参绿色面积一百五十多万平方米，这是一个多么巨大的养参基地啊！为了加强对场户联营的管理，他们除了坚持“立足扶持，让利于民”；“做投资主体，组织生产资料的供应”；“派驻技术员，为参户提供技术服务”外，还专门成立了“长白山人参辉南联营开发公司”，专门负责场户联营的管理、服务工作。“以场带户”的形式给参农带来了经济实惠，使他们眼界也更开阔了。在谈到“以场带户”的前景时，场长崔以顺说，明年联营户发展到五百户，面积五十万平方米，利用农村劳动力一千名，等于又建立了两个爱林参场。
