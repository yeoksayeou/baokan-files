The Dabancheng Wind Power Experimental Station in Xinjiang, with a total installed capacity of 2,105 kilowatts, has recently been completed and started generating electricity. This is currently the largest wind power experimental station in China, equipped with 15 wind turbines, with a designed annual power generation capacity of 7 million kilowatt-hours.

Xinjiang is rich in wind resources. Preliminary planning has identified 9 major wind areas, covering 150,000 square kilometers, with a capacity of 270 million kilowatts and an annual potential of over 80 billion kilowatt-hours. The completion of the Dabancheng Wind Power Experimental Station lays the foundation for the large-scale development and utilization of wind energy in Xinjiang.
