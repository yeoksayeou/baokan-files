When mentioning Liu Zongyuan, people would think of him as a great literary figure, one of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song dynasties. However, he was also a landscape architect.

Liu Zongyuan's landscape construction projects began after he was demoted to the position of Prefect of Yongzhou. Yongzhou is located upstream of the Xiangjiang River, surrounded by beautiful mountains and rivers. The position of Prefect was a relatively idle one, giving Liu Zongyuan ample time to explore the mountains and rivers, write poetry, and personally plan and construct six scenic spots: Chushi Stream, Guixi Pond, the small hill west of Guixi Pond, the western pavilion of Longxing Temple, the eastern hill of Longxing Temple, and the western pavilion of Fahua Temple. Later, when he was assigned to serve as the Governor of Liuzhou, he utilized a piece of wasteland by the Liujiang River to the south of the city to build a garden named Liuzhou Dongting. All seven of these scenic spots have articles written by Liu Zongyuan himself, detailing their origins.

Through his practical experience, Liu Zongyuan summarized the principles of landscape planning and construction.

Regarding the classification of landscapes, he divided them into two categories: "open" and "secluded." These two types of landscapes should fully exhibit their unique characteristics in the planning and design process, rather than being leveled out and losing their distinct features. For high and open areas, it is suitable to emphasize openness. "Utilizing its openness, even if you add high terraces and long galleries, encircling the sun and stars, overlooking the wind and rain, it will not be detrimental to its openness." For low and secluded areas, it is suitable to emphasize seclusion. "Utilizing its seclusion, even if you add dense trees and rocks, making it seem like a cave or a valley, lush like a forest, it will not be detrimental to its seclusion." The eastern hill of Longxing Temple, for example, is known for its seclusion, while the western pavilion of Fahua Temple is known for its openness.

Regarding the principles of landscape construction, he summarized them into three phrases: "Relax the people, adapt to the land, and preserve the natural." "Relax the people" means to save labor and materials, reducing construction costs. "Adapt to the land" means to make use of the natural terrain, not to blindly alter the landscape, and to utilize the existing soil, stones, water, and vegetation to create scenery. "Preserve the natural" means to preserve the natural charm of the scenery, not to overdo artificial embellishments, aiming to achieve a natural look even though it is man-made.

Regarding the social value of landscape construction, he believed that "a gentleman must have leisure and high-minded things, making him clear and calm, always having surplus energy, then he can manage distant affairs and accomplish tasks." He explained from psychological and physiological perspectives that landscapes play an indispensable role in improving work efficiency.

    中国第一位景观建筑家——柳宗元
    提起柳宗元，人们就会想到他是一位大文豪，是唐宋八大家之一。不过，他还是一位景观建筑家。
    柳宗元的景观建设工程是在他贬官为永州司马后开始的。永州位于湘江上游，周围多佳山水。司马则是一个闲官，柳宗元有充裕的时间游山玩水，吟诗作文，还亲自动手，规划建造了愚溪、钴鉧潭、钴鉧潭西城小丘、龙兴寺西轩、龙兴寺东丘、法华寺西亭等六处景点。后来他被派到柳州任刺史，又利用州城南面柳江边上的一块荒地建造了一座园子，名为柳州东亭。以上七处风景点，都有他本人所写的文章纪其始末。
    通过实践，柳宗元总结了关于风景区规划和建设的原则。
    关于风景的分类。他把风景分为两类：一是“旷”，即开阔；二是“奥”，即深邃。这两类风景在规划设计中应该充分发扬各自的特色，而不要相互拉平，模糊自己的性格。凡是高垲开朗之处，则宜于“旷”，“因其旷，虽增以崇台延阁，回环日星，临瞰风雨，不可病其敞也”，凡是低坳迫合之地，则宜于“奥”，“因其奥，虽增以茂树丛石，穹若洞谷，蓊若林麓，不可病其邃也”。他做的龙兴寺东丘景点，就是以“奥”见长的，而法华寺西亭则以“旷”取胜了。
    关于景观建设的原则。他概括成三句话：“逸其人。因其地。全其天。”“逸其人”就是要节约人力物力，减省工程开支。“因其地”就是因地制宜，不要盲目改造地形，要利用原有土石、水泉、草木来造景。“全其天”，是要保全景色的天然真趣，不要过分施加人工雕琢，要做到虽由人作，宛自天开。
    关于景观建设的社会价值，他认为，“君子必有游息之物、高明之具，使之清宁平夷，恒若有余，然后理远而事成”。他从心理和生理的角度说明了景观对促进工作效率的提高具有不容忽视的作用。
