The National CPPCC Proposal Work Symposium, which concluded today, called for efforts to improve and strengthen proposal work, enhance the quality of proposals, and better serve the rectification and restructuring, deepening of reforms, and socialist construction.

Vice Chairpersons of the National CPPCC, Fang Yi, Ma Wenrui, and Cheng Siyuan, attended the meeting.

Peng Youjin, Vice Chairman of the National CPPCC Proposal Committee, delivered a summary speech at the meeting.

The meeting noted that CPPCC proposals are an important channel for the Party and government leadership to listen to opinions from all sides and make democratic decisions, and are an important means for CPPCC members to participate in political discussions and decision-making. CPPCC proposals play a significant role in upholding the four cardinal principles, promoting rectification and restructuring, deepening reforms, maintaining stability and unity, and advancing socialist democracy and legal construction.

The meeting noted that in recent years, the quality of proposals from the CPPCC has been continuously improving, and the vast majority of proposals have played a positive role in promoting actual work. All levels of the CPPCC should start from reality, strive to improve the quality of proposals, and ensure that CPPCC proposals are serious, scientific, and feasible.

The meeting hoped that all members of the National CPPCC and all levels of CPPCC members would supervise and criticize the erroneous actions of various departments and localities that violate the decisions of the central authorities, and even write letters to the National CPPCC or directly report to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. All levels of the CPPCC should continue to uphold democracy, improve and strengthen proposal work, and make proposal work play a greater role.
