The top military leader of the "Medellín Cartel" international drug trafficking organization in Colombia, Rodrigo Gaviria, was killed by police in the province of Sucre on the 15th.

The Colombian police authorities announced on the 15th that the police forces surrounded Gaviria in the La Estrella area of Sucre. During the exchange of fire, Gaviria, his 17-year-old son, and 15 of his bodyguards were killed. One police officer was injured.

According to reports, the 39-year-old Gaviria was a notorious drug lord with a fortune of more than 20 billion dollars. He once commanded a 4,000-strong armed force and was involved in the assassination of anti-drug advocates and leftist leaders. The government had offered a $250,000 reward for his capture.

The Colombian police authorities believe that the killing of Gaviria is the most significant achievement since the country launched a large-scale anti-drug campaign in August. In the past four months, Colombia has arrested or detained more than 11,000 drug traffickers.

    哥警察当局十五日宣布，警察部队在苏克雷省的拉埃特雷亚地区包围了加查，在交火中，加查同他十七岁的儿子以及十五个保镖毙命，警察方面一人受伤。
    据报道，三十九岁的加查是世界上有名的大毒枭，拥有二十多亿美元的财产，还曾拥有过一支四千人的武装，从事暗杀主张扫毒的各界人士和左派领导人。政府曾悬赏二十五万美元捉拿加查。
