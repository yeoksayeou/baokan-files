People's Bank of China notes issued in the 1960s typically featured non-specific landscapes on the back. The one-yuan note depicted a pasture; the two-yuan note showed an oil field; and the five-yuan note featured a mine. Only the ten-yuan note, which was humorously referred to as the "Great Unity" (because it featured an image of various ethnic groups uniting) had a specific landmark on the back: the Tiananmen Gate.

In the 1980s, newly issued notes from one yuan to ten yuan, a total of six denominations, each featured a specific scenic image of famous landmarks, making them quite appealing to look at. The one-yuan note depicted a bird's-eye view of the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The two-yuan note featured the "Southern Pillar of Heaven" scenic image. The "Southern Pillar of Heaven" is located at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island in the "End of the Earth and Corner of the Sea" scenic spot in Sanya City. It is a towering rock standing by the sea, with the characters "Southern Pillar of Heaven" inscribed on it, which were carved during the Qing Dynasty. The five-yuan note depicted the Wu Gorge scenic image. The ten-yuan note featured the Mount Everest scenic image. The fifty-yuan note depicted the Yellow River's Dragon Gate scenic image. The one-hundred-yuan note featured the revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan.

    人民币上的风景图
    六十年代出版的人民币背面一般都只印非特定的景物，一元的是牧场；二元的是油田；五元的是矿山。只有被戏称为“大团结”（因其正面印有各族人民大团结图画）的十元钞票背面印有特定的名胜古迹天安门城楼。
    八十年代新出版的新版式人民币背面，从一元至十元共六种，都有一幅特定的名胜古迹风景画，颇有观赏价值。一元钞票背面印的是八达岭俯视图。二元钞票背面印的是“南天一柱”风景图。“南天一柱”位于海南岛最南端的三亚市“天涯海角”风景点中。这是一块屹立在海边的参天巨石，巨石上刻有“南天一柱”四个大字，是清代人所刻。五元钞票背面印的是巫峡风景图。十元钞票背面印的是珠穆朗玛峰风景图。五十元钞票背面印的是黄河壶口风景图。一百元钞票背面印有革命老根据地井冈山风景图。
