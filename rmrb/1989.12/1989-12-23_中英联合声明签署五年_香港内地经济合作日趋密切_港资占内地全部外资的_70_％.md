Five years ago, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue was formally signed in Beijing. At that time, some people who lacked confidence in Hong Kong's future and regarded the mainland as a "dangerous place" would never have imagined that today, Hong Kong businessmen have established more than 15,000 "three-come-one-compensate" enterprises in the mainland. Hong Kong capital now accounts for 70% of all foreign investment in the mainland, firmly holding the first position. Economic development has made the ties between the two places increasingly close and deep.

In the past, the low-cost labor, land, and raw materials in the coastal regions of the mainland also attracted Hong Kong businessmen who intended to move north. Hong Kong businessmen, who have a close connection with the Pearl River Delta, were the first to invest and set up factories in their hometowns. However, when the Sino-British negotiations on the Hong Kong issue began, some businessmen who were skeptical about Hong Kong's future hesitated. After the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong's situation stabilized, which dispelled the doubts of eager Hong Kong businessmen. The mainland's reform and opening-up, as well as its preferential policies for Hong Kong and Macau investments, further boosted the confidence of Hong Kong compatriots in investing in the mainland.

In 1984, the year the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, Hong Kong's investment in the mainland was only over 10 billion US dollars. By 1988, it had exceeded 30 billion US dollars. The Pearl River Delta has become a production base for Hong Kong, and Hong Kong factories equipped with advanced technology and equipment have become honored guests there. The vehicles traveling between Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, which must pass through the Shenzhen Wenjin Bridge, form long queues every day, waiting to go through the customs. The busy scene has led to the construction of the second channel at the Luomazhou border crossing.

According to experts, the 2 million workers in the Pearl River Delta engaged in processing industries can create a profit of 1,000 US dollars per person per year for Hong Kong businessmen.

The increase in trade between the mainland and Hong Kong is even more significant. In 1984, the total trade value between the two places was only 95.1 billion Hong Kong dollars, but by 1988, it had increased to over 288.5 billion Hong Kong dollars, doubling in just four years. In 1985, the mainland became Hong Kong's largest trading partner, marking the beginning of a new era where the mainland and Hong Kong are each other's largest trading partners. With the continuous strengthening of the mainland's external economic exchanges, it has stimulated the development of Hong Kong's re-export trade. The Kwai Chung Container Terminal in Hong Kong, which plays a crucial role in re-export trade, surpassed Rotterdam in the Netherlands to become the world's largest container port in 1987. Analysts believe that more than 75% of Hong Kong's re-export trade is related to the mainland. Meanwhile, financial, tourism, and technological exchanges between the two places have also developed rapidly. The busy commercial exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland are no longer limited to the Pearl River Delta near the Luohu Bridge but have extended to coastal regions and even the entire country. Not only are there lively trade and investment exchanges with major cities, but Hong Kong businessmen have even ventured into some remote areas. Businessmen are busy on both sides of the Luohu Bridge. Mr. Zhu Lili, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the First Eastern Investment Company of Hong Kong, learned of the birth of his beloved daughter in a Beijing hospital rather than in Hong Kong.

After the June 4th Beijing Incident, although some people advocated for Hong Kong businessmen to move their factories in the mainland to Southeast Asian countries, the normal production of Guangdong factories dispelled this idea. Mr. Yang Xiaohua, the representative of the Jardine Matheson Hong Kong Limited in Beijing, recently stated that the politically stable, investment-friendly, and Hong Kong-Macau-adjacent South China region is irreplaceable by Southeast Asia and is the easiest place for Hong Kong businessmen to make money. Another Hong Kong businessman who set up a factory in Beijing, when analyzing the prospects of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland, pointed out that as long as the Sino-British Joint Declaration is strictly implemented and the Chinese government continues to pursue the policy of reform and opening-up, there will be a broad prospect for economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland.

### 中英联合声明签署五年  香港内地经济合作日趋密切  港资占内地全部外资的70％

    中英联合声明签署五年
    香港内地经济合作日趋密切
    港资占内地全部外资的70％
    新华社北京12月22日电（记者黄日尧）5年前中英关于香港问题的联合声明在北京正式签署之际，一些对香港前途缺乏信心而把中国内地视为“畏途”的人，怎么也不会想到今天港商已经在内地创办了1.5万多家“三来一补”企业，港资已占内地全部外资的70％而稳居第一位。经济的发展使两地的联系日趋密切和深入。
    过去，内地沿海地区的廉宜劳动力、土地和原材料也吸引着有意北上的香港商人，与珠江三角洲有着血肉联系的港商也曾经率先在自己的家乡进行试探性的投资设厂。可是，当中英两国开始香港问题谈判时，少数对香港前途抱怀疑态度的厂商却因此裹足不前。中英联合声明签署后香港出现稳定局势，才使跃跃欲试的香港厂商们始释重惑，内地的改革开放及对港澳投资的优惠政策更增加了香港同胞对投资内地的信心。
    中英联合声明签署的1984年，港商在内地的投资只有10多亿美元，1988年就超过30亿美元。珠江三角洲更成为香港的后方生产基地，带着先进技术和设备的香港厂商已成为那里的座上宾。来往于香港与珠江三角洲的车辆必经之道——深圳文锦渡海关，每天都有满载进出口原料或成品的车辆排成长龙，等候出入关的繁忙局面迎来落马洲第二道关口通道的修建。
    据专家们估计，仅珠江三角洲从事加工工业的200万劳工，每人每年便可为港商创造1000美元的利润。
    内地与香港间的贸易增加更为显著，1984年双方贸易总值仅为951亿港元，1988年则增加到2885亿多港元，短短的4年里增加了2倍。1985年内地成为香港的第一大贸易伙伴，至此开创了中国内地与香港互为最大贸易伙伴的新阶段。随着内地对外经济交往的不断加强，刺激了香港转口贸易的发展。在转口贸易中占有举足轻重地位的香港葵涌货柜码头1987年超过荷兰鹿特丹成为世界第一吞吐港。分析家们认为，香港的转口贸易中有七成半以上是与内地有关的。与此同时，两地间的金融、旅游和科技的交往也得到迅速的发展。香港与内地繁忙的工商业往来早已不局限于罗湖桥畔的珠江三角洲，而是延伸到沿海地区以至全国各地，不但与各大城市贸易投资往来热络，港商的足迹甚至踏入了一些穷乡僻壤。厂商奔忙于罗湖桥两边。香港第一东方投资有限公司董事会主席诸立力先生在北京而不是在香港医院得知他喜得爱女。
    6月北京风波后，尽管有人主张港商把在内地投资办的厂搬到东南亚国家去，但广东厂家正常生产的事实使他们打消了这一念头。太古集团香港有限公司驻北京代表杨孝华先生不久前表示，政治局势稳定、投资环境优越而又毗邻港澳的华南地区是东南亚无法取代的，是港商最容易赚钱的地方。另一位在北京设厂的港商在分析香港与内地经济合作的前景时指出，只要中英双方严格执行联合声明，中国政府继续奉行改革开放政策，香港与内地的经济合作就有广阔的发展前景。
