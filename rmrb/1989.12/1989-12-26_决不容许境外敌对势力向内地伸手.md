The turmoil that occurred in Beijing this past spring and summer was meticulously planned and orchestrated by a small number of individuals who sought to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the legitimate government of China, aiming to subvert the socialist system. Their actions not only violated China's constitution but also transgressed China's criminal laws. The Chinese government took decisive measures to quell the riot, and in accordance with the law, punished those who planned, organized, and carried out the riot. This is a just action that any sovereign government must take, and it has been resolutely supported by the vast majority of the people of all ethnic groups in China. It has also been understood and supported by the governments and peoples of most countries and regions around the world, as well as by international public opinion that upholds justice. The measures taken by the Chinese government to quell the riot are entirely in accordance with internationally recognized legal and human rights principles.

During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, many compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, due to their lack of understanding of the true situation and influenced by erroneous media guidance and distorted propaganda from overseas, participated in some supportive and sympathetic activities. This is understandable. However, in Hong Kong and Macau, particularly in Hong Kong, there are indeed a few individuals who, with the reactionary political goal of overthrowing the Central People's Government and subverting China's socialist system, have been running around, stirring up trouble, and colluding with a small number of counter-revolutionaries and those who persist in reactionary positions within the mainland. They have engaged in numerous activities that are hostile to the Chinese government and the broad masses of the people. The few leaders of the "Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China" have played precisely this unscrupulous role. After the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing was suppressed, their plots suffered a shameful failure. However, they are not reconciled to this and have since conspired to recruit a group of social dregs to engage in the so-called "rescue of democracy activists." They use smuggling methods to bring fugitives wanted by our public security organs to Hong Kong and Macau, and then send them abroad, allowing them to escape legal punishment and continue their anti-China, anti-Communist, and anti-socialist activities under the patronage of international reactionary forces. There is no doubt that the Chinese government will not tolerate such blatant violations of China's criminal law and border control regulations.

The policy of peaceful reunification and the concept of "one country, two systems" are the basic principles for handling the Hong Kong and Macau issues. The Chinese government has reached agreements with the British and Portuguese governments respectively. As Comrade Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out in his speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, "We will not change the capitalist system in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, nor will we allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base to subvert the central government." In a nutshell, the principle for handling the relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau is "mutual non-interference." People from the mainland going to the Hong Kong and Macau regions must abide by the local laws, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau returning to the mainland must also abide by the constitution and laws of the state. Anyone who attempts to change China's socialist system and engages in criminal activities hostile to the Chinese government within China's territory will surely be severely punished by the law. The fates of Luo Haixing, Li Longqing, Li Peicheng, Xie Zhenrong, and Chen Zewen are the most powerful evidence of this.

    决不容许境外敌对势力向内地伸手
    本报评论员
    今年春夏之交北京发生的风波，是极少数妄图推翻中国共产党的领导和中国合法政府、颠覆社会主义制度的人蓄意策划和制造的。这些人的所作所为，不仅违反了中国的宪法，而且触犯了中国的刑律。中国政府采取果断措施平息暴乱，依法制裁策划、制造、组织暴乱的犯罪分子，这是任何一个主权国家的政府都不能不采取的正义行动，受到全国各族广大人民群众的坚决拥护，并得到世界大多数国家和地区的政府、人民及国际公正舆论的理解和支持。中国政府平息暴乱的措施，完全符合国际公认的法律和人权原则。
    在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，不少港澳同胞由于不了解事实真相，受错误舆论导向和海外某些歪曲宣传的影响，参加了一些支持和声援活动，这是可以理解的。但是，在港澳地区尤其在香港确有极少数人出于推翻中央人民政府、颠覆中国社会主义制度的反动政治目的，东奔西走，推波助澜，与内地的极少数反革命分子及坚持反动立场的人相互勾结，狼狈为奸，干了大量与中国政府为敌、与广大人民为敌的勾当。“港支联”少数领头人正是充当了这样一种极不光彩的角色。在北京的反革命暴乱被平息后，这一伙人的阴谋遭到可耻失败。但他们并不甘心，于是又密谋策划，网罗一批社会渣滓，搞起所谓“营救民运人士”的营生。他们采取偷渡的办法，把被我公安机关依法通缉的反革命要犯接应到港澳，然后送往国外，使他们逃避法律的制裁，得以在国际反动势力的豢养下继续从事反华反共反社会主义活动。毫无疑问，对这种公然违犯中国刑法和出入境管理法的行为，我国政府是决不会容忍的。
    和平统一祖国的方针和“一国两制”的构想，是我们处理香港、澳门问题的基本准则，我国政府已分别同英国、葡萄牙政府达成了协议。正如中共中央总书记江泽民在庆祝国庆四十周年大会上讲话中所指出的：“我们不会改变港澳地区的资本主义制度，也不允许有人利用香港作为颠覆中央政府的基地。”处理内地和港澳关系的这一原则，用一句俗话来说就叫作“井水不犯河水”。内地的人去港澳地区必须遵守当地的法律，港澳同胞回到内地也必须遵守国家的宪法和法律。不论什么人，妄图改变中国的社会主义制度而在我国境内从事敌视中国政府的犯罪活动，必将受到法律的严厉惩罚。罗海星、李龙庆、黎沛成、谢振荣、陈泽伟的下场，就是最有力的明证。
