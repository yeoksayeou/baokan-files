In recent years, Chinese-published Spanish-language children's books have become increasingly popular in various Latin American countries. Currently, a "Chinese children's book boom" is taking place in Mexico and some other Latin American countries.

Since this year, China has participated in several international book fairs held in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay. The Spanish-language Chinese children's books exhibited have been well-received by various sectors of society in these countries. Many publishers and distributors from these nations have actively approached us to discuss business, requesting orders or joint publications of Chinese children's books.

Recently, Mexico held international book fairs in both the capital and Guadalajara. In addition to Latin American countries, major publishing nations such as the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union also participated. China exhibited over 400 books, with 300 of them being Spanish-language children's books. During the fairs, Chinese children's books were widely welcomed by publishers and distributors from various countries. They flocked to select and purchase or request joint publications of Chinese children's books. The heads of the publishers' associations from Peru, Venezuela, and Paraguay proactively approached our foreign language publishing institution's representative in Mexico to discuss joint publications of Chinese children's books. Chinese children's books have also garnered significant attention from various sectors of Mexican society. The Mexican National Radio Station aired a special program introducing Chinese children's books. The Mexican Ministry of Education's publishing house is preparing to collaborate with us to publish some Chinese children's books as supplementary educational materials for Mexican preschool children and primary school students.

Why have Chinese children's books been able to enter the Latin American market and be loved by people from all walks of life? According to reader feedback, it is mainly because Chinese children's books have a strong national flavor and distinctive Eastern cultural characteristics. The language is lively and vivid, the illustrations are beautiful, the content is healthy, the knowledge is rich, and they are highly educational. Additionally, Chinese children's books are beautifully designed, reasonably priced, and competitive in the Latin American market.

In recent years, the China Foreign Languages Publishing House and the China Dolphin Publishing House have specifically published nearly 300 themed children's books for the Latin American region, with an average annual sales volume of around 200,000 copies. Among the Spanish-language children's books published and distributed, there are series such as "Chinese Folklore Collection," "Chinese Popular Science Collection," "Chinese Children's Collection," "Journey to the West Collection," and "Strange Tales from Liao Zhai Collection."

    拉美出现“中国儿童读物热”
    新华社墨西哥城12月24日电　（记者刘国强）近年来，中国出版的西班牙语儿童读物在拉丁美洲各国越来越受欢迎。目前，在墨西哥及拉美部分国家出现了“中国儿童读物热”。
    今年以来，我国参加了在阿根廷、墨西哥、哥伦比亚、智利和乌拉圭举办的多次国际书展，参展的西班牙语中国儿童读物深受这些国家社会各界的欢迎，许多国家的图书出版发行商纷纷与我洽谈业务，要求订购或合作出版中国儿童读物。
    最近，墨西哥分别在首都和瓜达拉哈拉城举办了国际书展，除拉美国家外，美、英、法、苏等世界出版大国也都参加了这些书展。我国参展图书400多种，其中300种是西班牙语儿童读物。书展期间，中国儿童读物受到各国出版发行商的普遍欢迎。他们纷纷前来选购或要求合作出版中国儿童书籍。秘鲁、委内瑞拉和巴拉圭出版商协会主要负责人主动与我外文出版机构驻墨代表洽谈，要求与我合作出版中国儿童读物。中国儿童读物也引起了墨西哥社会各界的高度重视。墨西哥国家电台专门播放了介绍中国儿童读物的专题节目。墨西哥教育部出版社已准备与我合作出版部分中国儿童读物，作为墨西哥对本国学龄前儿童和小学生教育的辅助性教材。
    中国儿童读物为何能进入拉美市场并得到社会各阶层的喜爱呢？据读者反映，主要是因为中国儿童读物具有浓厚的民族特色和东方文化的特点，语言生动活泼，插图优美，内容健康，知识性强，富有教育意义；另外，中国儿童读物装潢精美，价格适中，在拉美市场上具有竞争力。
    近年来，中国外文出版社和中国海豚出版社专门为拉美地区出版了近300个专题的儿童读物，年均销售量达20万册左右。在出版发行的这些西班牙语儿童读物中，有《中国民间传说丛书》、《中国科普丛书》、《中国幼儿丛书》、《中国儿童丛书》、《美猴王丛书》和《聊斋丛书》等系列儿童书籍。
