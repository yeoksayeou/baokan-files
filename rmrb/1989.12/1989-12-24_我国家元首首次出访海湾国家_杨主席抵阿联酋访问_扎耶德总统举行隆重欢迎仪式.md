After the special plane came to a halt, Chairman Yang descended the steps, greeted by Sheikh Zayed, who was waiting at the foot of the steps. The two leaders shook hands warmly and exchanged greetings.

A grand welcome ceremony was held at the airport, with 21 gun salutes. Chairman Yang, accompanied by Sheikh Zayed, ascended the reviewing stand. The military band played the national anthems of both countries. Chairman Yang, accompanied by Sheikh Zayed, walked down the red carpet to review the guard of honor, which saluted the two heads of state.

Chairman Yang then shook hands with senior officials of the UAE government and ambassadors from various countries stationed in the UAE.

After the ceremony, Chairman Yang, accompanied by Sheikh Zayed, left the airport for Al-Mahbar Palace.

Accompanying Chairman Yang on his visit were Wang Boping, State Councilor and Minister of Finance, Qi Huaiyuan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Lü Xuejin, Vice Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, who all arrived on the same plane.

In his written statement at the airport, Chairman Yang said, "I am very pleased to visit the beautiful UAE, known as the 'Pearl of the Gulf,' for an official friendly visit. The traditional friendship between the peoples of China and the UAE is long-standing. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the UAE in 1984, friendly cooperation between the two countries has developed smoothly, and we are very satisfied with this. This visit is made with the sincere wish to enhance understanding, strengthen friendship, promote cooperation, and achieve common development. I look forward to exchanging views with President Zayed and other leaders on bilateral relations and major international issues of common concern. I believe that through the joint efforts of both sides, this visit will be a complete success."
