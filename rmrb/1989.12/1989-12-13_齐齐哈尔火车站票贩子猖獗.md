Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, September 12th.

    Editor's Note: In order to rectify the order at railway stations and trains, the railway department has done a lot of work over the years and has achieved some results. However, these two letters reflect problems from two months ago. Now, we do not know if the situation has improved or if it remains the same. If it has improved, that is great, and it should be maintained; if it remains the same, the relevant local departments should take action. Because, to establish and maintain good order at railway stations and trains, in addition to the railway department continuing its efforts, the whole society needs to provide support and assistance. The railway department alone has limited power.

    Ticket Scalpers Rampant at Qiqihar Railway Station

    On September 12th, while on a business trip and transferring at Qiqihar Railway Station, I noticed a group of ticket scalpers operating in the ticket hall. I saw two passengers heading to Beijing pay an additional 20 yuan per ticket to purchase two tickets with seat numbers from the scalpers. I also saw a passenger heading to Shenyang who, after haggling with the scalpers, was taken outside the hall by several scalpers. I do not know what happened to him afterward.

### 齐齐哈尔火车站票贩子猖獗

    编者按：为了整顿铁路站、车秩序，多年来铁路部门做了大量工作，取得了一定成效。然而，这两封来信反映的是两个月前的问题。现在不知道是已改观了，还是照旧？如已改观，那太好了，要坚持下去；如还是照旧，当地有关部门应该出面抓一下。因为，要建立、维护良好的铁路站、车秩序，除铁路部门还需继续努力外，全社会要给予支持和协助，光靠铁路部门，力量毕竟有限。
    齐齐哈尔火车站票贩子猖獗
    9月12日，我出差经齐齐哈尔火车站中转时，发现在这个车站的售票大厅里，有一群票贩子在活动。我见到有两位去北京的旅客以每张多付20元的高价，从票贩子手里购买了两张带有座席号的车票；还有一个去沈阳的旅客，因与票贩子讨价还价，被几个票贩子架到大厅外边去了，不知会被怎样处置。
