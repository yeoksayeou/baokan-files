Cao Youzhi, a middle-aged farmer with a dark face and a thin build. Twenty years ago, he became the secretary of the Liugang Village Party Branch in Sheqi County, Henan Province.

Liugang Village, located on the eastern edge of the Nanyang Basin, has 5,300 mu of farmland on "two ridges" and "three slopes." During droughts, the land is as hard as rock, and during floods, it becomes a muddy mess. The yield per mu is only about 20 jin, and the lives of the people are extremely difficult.

Cao Youzhi was not intimidated by the difficulties. He and the Party Branch leadership led the masses to brave the wind and snow, working from dawn till dusk for over a decade. With their own hands, they dug 244 drainage ditches totaling 79 kilometers; repaired over 100 irrigation canals and roads; and transformed 4,500 mu of "three-run fields" into "three-guarantee fields."

In the summer of 1988, the Nanyang region experienced an 80-day drought. However, in Liugang Village, the wheat fields waved in the wind, and the full ears of wheat swayed in the breeze. During the harvest season, 3,800 mu of wheat had an average yield of 379 jin per mu. This summer and autumn, the yield increased by another 10%.

To help the villagers become prosperous on this barren land as soon as possible, Cao Youzhi subscribed to more than 10 agricultural science and technology journals, guiding everyone to focus on "cleverness." He knew that farming could not rely solely on intuition; it also required science to improve the villagers' quality. He mobilized the villagers to raise 230,000 yuan to build a teaching building, adding 55 classrooms and universalizing primary and secondary education; he led the village cadres to go out and learn, inviting technical personnel to give lectures in the village, and successively establishing two training classes for agricultural machinery repair and agricultural technology, enabling hundreds of villagers to learn agricultural technology, with 45 reaching the standard of agricultural technicians.

Some people say that being an official is difficult, and being a grassroots official in the countryside is even more difficult. Cao Youzhi, however, does not think so. He said, "Being an official is first and foremost about doing. Once you do something, you won't be afraid of difficulties."

The Liugang Village Party Branch and Village Committee have only 5 people, most of whom hold two positions. The entire village's 3,800 mu of wheat fields, from fertilization and mechanized farming to field management, Cao Youzhi and his colleagues are always at the forefront. On sunny days, they are covered in dust; on rainy days, they are covered in mud. The villagers see this and remember it in their hearts. They respect them and demand that their allowances be increased, but Cao Youzhi insists on letting the cadres sweat more rather than burdening the masses. Over the years, the per capita income of the villagers has risen from a few dozen yuan to over 970 yuan, with only 14.87 yuan in levies, and the village cadres' allowances have not been increased by a single cent. Cao Youzhi said, "Communist Party members must do more for the masses; otherwise, you shouldn't join the Party!"

Due to his busy work schedule, Cao Youzhi often eats irregularly, leading to severe stomach problems, with a stomach prolapse of 12 centimeters. He often uses a wide cloth belt to tighten his waist and works from dawn till dusk. Once, Cao Youzhi had to convey the spirit of higher-level instructions, but his stomach acted up. He had to lean against the wall to speak. For two whole hours, Cao Youzhi's sweat dripped down his forehead, and the onlookers were moved to tears.

Good party style brings good folk style. Since 1980, Liugang Village has had no out-of-plan births, no criminal cases, and a 100% late marriage and late childbearing rate, family planning rate, and contraceptive rate.

Twenty years of entrepreneurship, twenty years of sweat, the poor and backward Liugang Village has "blossomed" and become a famous model village for dryland farming. In recent years, the village has been named a "double civilization unit" by the county and district. Cao Youzhi has made outstanding contributions to this, and he has become a national labor model. But he is not satisfied; he is leading the entire village to sketch a more beautiful picture of Liugang Village.

    黄土地上的脚印
    ——记带领群众艰苦奋斗的刘岗村党支书曹有志
    尹中贵
    曹有志，一个脸膛黝黑、身材消瘦的中年庄稼汉。20年前，他担任了河南省社旗县刘岗村党支部书记。
    位于南阳盆地东部边缘地带的刘岗村，5300亩耕地挂在“两岗”、“三面坡”上，逢旱硬梆梆，遇涝一包浆，亩产只有20多公斤，群众生活极其困苦。
    曹有志没有被困难吓倒，他和党支部一班人带领群众顶风冒雪，朝出暮归，历时十多个春秋，靠一双双手开挖排水沟244条，总长达79公里；整修水渠和道路100多条；修方田4500亩，昔日的“三跑田”今日变成“三保田”。
    1988年夏季，南阳地区持续80天遭受干旱。然而，在刘岗村，麦浪翻滚，饱满的麦穗迎风摇曳。收获季节，3800亩小麦平均单产379公斤。今年夏秋又增产10％。
    为使村民在贫瘠地上早日致富，曹有志订阅10多种农业科技报刊，引导大家在“巧”上做文章。他心里清楚，种庄稼光凭一点感性认识远远不行，还要靠科学提高村民的素质。他动员村民集资23万元，盖起教学楼，新增校舍55间，普及了中小学教育；带领村干部走出去学习，请技术人员进村讲课，先后办起农机维修和农业技术两个辅导班，使三四百村民学习了农业技术知识，45人达到农业技术员标准。
    有人说，当干部难，当农村基层干部更难，曹有志却不以为然。他说：“当干部首先是干，干出了样子就不怕难。”
    刘岗村党支部、村委会总共只有5人，多数是一人兼两职。全村3800亩麦田，从施肥、机耕，到田间管理等，曹有志他们都跑在前头，晴天一身土，雨天一身泥。乡亲们看在眼里，记在心上。大家敬重他们，要求给他们增加补贴，但曹有志坚持宁可干部多流汗，不让群众多负担。几年来，村民人均收入从几十元上升到970元以上，提留款只有14.87元，村干部补贴一分不加。曹有志说：“共产党员就要多为群众操心办事，不然你就别入这个党！”
    由于工作繁忙，吃饭饥一顿饱一顿没个规律，曹有志染上了严重的胃病，胃下垂12厘米。他常常用一条宽布带勒紧腰，起早贪黑地干。一次，曹有志要传达上级指示精神，胃病发作了，他只好靠着墙讲话。整整两个小时，曹有志头上的汗珠一滴一滴往下落，在场群众感动地流下了眼泪。
    好党风带出好民风。刘岗村从1980年以来，全村无计划外生育、无刑事案件，晚婚晚育率、计划生育率、节育率均达100％。
    20年的创业，20年的汗水，贫穷落后的刘岗村“红”起来了，变成遐迩闻名的旱作农业模范村。近几年，这个村先后被县地命名为“双文明单位”。这中间有曹有志的突出贡献，他因此成为全国劳动模范。但他并未满足，他正带领全村群众，勾勒刘岗村更美的画卷。
