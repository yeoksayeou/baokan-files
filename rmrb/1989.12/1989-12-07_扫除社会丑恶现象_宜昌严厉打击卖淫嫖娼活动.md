Yichang in Hubei Province has been steadfast in its efforts to combat and eradicate prostitution and patronization, effectively eliminating social evils. Statistics show that since 1987, the city has dismantled 18 prostitution dens, apprehended 259 individuals involved in prostitution and patronization, of whom 7 were sentenced to prison, 17 were sent to labor re-education, and 120 received administrative penalties.

In recent years, prostitution and patronization activities have resurfaced in the city, severely corrupting social morals. The municipal Party committee and government have repeatedly listened to reports from the municipal public security bureau regarding the investigation and control of prostitution and patronization activities across the city. They have convened meetings with public security, judicial, women's federation, and health departments to discuss specific measures for cracking down on and eradicating prostitution and patronization. Special funds have been allocated to cover the operational expenses for these efforts. The heads of various districts, streets (townships), and departments have personally overseen the operations, ensuring the smooth implementation of the city's anti-prostitution campaign.

The public security and judicial departments have adopted various effective measures, focusing on concentrated strikes and strengthening the management of hotels, inns, guesthouses, and private rental properties, as well as controlling key areas such as train stations, docks, and parks. Workers from Yichang Xuguang Cotton Mill, Xiang Yuquan and his wife Wang Daoxiu, along with unemployed individuals like Wang Fuming, have since September 1986 used deception, coercion, and inducement to lure over 20 young women to engage in prostitution at large hotels and guesthouses in Shenzhen and Zhuhai, illegally amassing tens of thousands of yuan. Upon the discovery of the case, the judicial authorities promptly took action, sentencing Xiang Yuquan and Wang Fuming to severe penalties.

    扫除社会丑恶现象
    宜昌严厉打击卖淫嫖娼活动
    本报讯　湖北省宜昌市坚持开展打击查禁卖淫嫖娼活动，扫除社会丑恶现象，取得显著成效。据统计，1987年以来，全市共摧毁嫖娼窝点18个，查获卖淫嫖娼人员259名，其中判刑7名，劳动教养17名，治安处罚120名。
    近几年来，卖淫嫖娼活动在该市死灰复燃，严重败坏社会风气。市委、市政府多次听取市公安局关于对全市卖淫嫖娼活动调查汇报，召集公安、司法、妇联、卫生等部门研究打击取缔卖淫嫖娼活动的具体措施，并拨出专款解决打击取缔卖淫嫖娼活动的办案经费。各区、街道（乡）和各部门主要负责人亲自动手，从而有效地保证了全市打击取缔卖淫活动顺利开展。
    公安政法部门采取多种有效措施，集中打击，并加强对酒店、旅社、宾馆和私房出租户的管理和对车站、码头、公园等地的控制。该市旭光棉纺厂工人向毓轩和其妻王道秀自1986年9月以来，伙同无业人员王夫明等人，采取诱骗、强迫、教唆等手段，先后欺骗20余名女青年到深圳、珠海的大酒店、宾馆卖淫，非法获利数万元。案发后，政法机关及时查处，将向毓轩、王夫明判处极刑。
