Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 19th.

China and Poland have decided to switch from traditional government-to-government barter trade to free foreign exchange trade starting from January 1, 1990.

This decision was announced after Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Li Lanqing and Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Stefan Amonowicz signed a trade agreement between the two governments in Warsaw. It is reported that this is the first time China has adopted this settlement method in its trade with Eastern European countries. This will be beneficial for further promoting the development of trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.
