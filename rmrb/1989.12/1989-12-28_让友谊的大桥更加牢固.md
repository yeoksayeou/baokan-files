This year has been an extraordinary year in the history of our People's Republic, and it has also been a year in which our country's people-to-people diplomacy has faced challenges and continued to achieve results. During this year, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) invited and received nearly 200 delegations from five continents, sent out nearly 30 delegations, held more than 30 major events, and met with thousands of foreign visitors. Additionally, several pairs of Chinese and foreign cities established friendly relations.

This year's people-to-people exchanges have several notable features: (1) Despite the impact of the "6.4" incident, nearly 100 delegations from various countries visited in the second half of the year. In addition to friendly visits, many delegations came to China for professional exchanges and inspections, including delegations led by the President of the American Cancer Society and the Chairman of the Italy-China Chamber of Commerce. During the National Day celebrations, delegations from North Korea, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United States, Togo, and other countries visited, making it one of the years with the most foreign visitors in Beijing during the National Day period. (2) Exchanges and friendships with Third World countries have further strengthened. More friends from African countries have come to visit. The delegation led by Ratna De, Secretary-General of the Indo-China Association and Member of Parliament, reflected the good wishes of the Indian people to develop friendly relations between the two countries. Thailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, an old friend of the Chinese people, visited China in his dual capacity as Prime Minister and President of the Thailand-China Friendship Association, and delivered a passionate speech at the welcoming banquet hosted by the CPAFFC and the China-Thailand Friendship Association, which can be said to reflect the true meaning of the Thai poem "Thais and Chinese are like one family." (3) While continuing to develop people-to-people friendly exchanges with Japan, Western Europe, North America, and Oceania, exchanges with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have increased with the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. The delegation led by Arkhipov, composed of old friends who have helped China's revolutionary and construction causes, visited China, embodying the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. (4) There were many significant commemorative activities. For example, this year marks not only the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China but also the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and 10 socialist countries including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and East Germany; this year is also the 50th anniversary of the death of the great internationalist Dr. Norman Bethune; the imminent independence of Namibia after a long anti-colonial struggle and the birth of the State of Palestine have made the commemorative activities of "Namibia Day" and "International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People" particularly significant. In addition, this year is the 35th anniversary of the CPAFFC's engagement in people's diplomacy. (5) Party and state leaders have paid great attention to people's diplomacy. The main leaders of the central government have met with international friends on many occasions and personally engaged in people's friendship work. Many foreign friends have been deeply moved by this and expressed their willingness to make greater efforts to further develop friendly relations with China.

It is undeniable that the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing in the spring and summer of this year posed a severe test for our people's diplomacy. Due to the distorted reports and even fabricated rumors by some Western media, an anti-China tide was stirred up in the international community, causing many organizations and individuals who have long been friendly to China to encounter new difficulties in their work. Even so, the majority of foreign organizations and individuals friendly to China have not wavered in their belief in friendship with the Chinese people. Leaders of some friendly organizations have written to us, expressing their understanding and support for the decisive measures taken by the Chinese government to quell the rebellion. Among the more than 300 foreign provinces and cities that have established friendly relations with China, more than 80% have not been affected by this incident, and their exchanges with their counterpart friendly provinces and cities in China continue as usual. However, we have also seen that this anti-China tide has indeed caused some psychological impact and pressure on some countries' friendly organizations, cities, and friends. Some friends have expressed concern and misunderstanding about the domestic situation in China in their letters and telegrams to the CPAFFC. Therefore, timely and patient explanations through various channels to clarify the facts and dispel misunderstandings, so that the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world, which have been established through years of effort, are not damaged, have become an important part of the CPAFFC's work in 1989.

On June 28, the CPAFFC issued an open letter to foreign friends and organizations friendly to China, pointing out the nature of this incident and reaffirming China's desire to continue to cooperate and exchange with various foreign organizations and individuals friendly to China. Since July, batches of foreign friends have visited China upon invitation, witnessing firsthand what has happened in China. They have had in-depth discussions with officials from the municipal government, teachers and students from schools, and troops from the martial law enforcement, and have watched videos and visited the sites. Many friends have also directly heard the explanations of Chinese leaders about the true situation of the incident. A large amount of detailed information and vivid realities have dispelled the doubts of many friends, and they have expressed respect and understanding for the decisive measures taken by the Chinese government.

The facts after the "6.4" incident show that the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world, which has been cultivated and developed through long-term efforts, has a deep foundation and can withstand any storm. This is not only reflected in the support and understanding of the peoples of the Third World but also in the clear attitude of various friendly people in Japan to continue to promote the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship. When the President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Tsutomu Hato, visited China in August, he specially brought his son and grandson, and told Li Peng, the Premier, that this was to ensure that the children and grandchildren of the two countries can continue to be friendly. When the President of the Japan-China Parliamentary Friendship League, Yoshimasa Yonezu, visited China in September, he expressed his complete agreement with Deng Xiaoping's view that no matter what changes occur internationally or domestically in Japan and China, Sino-Japanese friendship cannot change and will not change. At the fourth Sino-Japanese people's friendship exchange meeting held in Tokyo in November, both sides exchanged views on how to carry out friendly exchanges under the current situation and reached a consensus. Even in European and American countries, there are many friends who insist on being friendly to China and speak out for justice. A friend from the "British Understanding China" Association wrote in a letter that we do not understand all the truth, but we do know that under the support of our "free media," there are indeed counter-revolutionary forces in China trying to stir up trouble. An old friend from the American-China Friendship Association, after visiting China, expressed that despite possible criticism and challenges, he would still strive to tell the truth to the people upon his return. The Chinese people are very grateful for the valuable support of friends from various countries. Of course, we have also noticed that for various reasons, some friends still have different views on this incident. This is not a problem. We still regard them as friends of the Chinese people and believe that with the continuous development of China's reform and opening-up, this part of friends will also draw fair conclusions on their own. We believe that the 1990s will be a decade of great development for China's socialist modernization, and it will also be a decade when China's people's diplomacy will bear rich fruits.

    让友谊的大桥更加牢固
    章文晋　韩叙
    今年，是我们人民共和国历史上不平凡的一年，也是我国对外民间友好工作经受考验并继续取得成绩的一年。在这一年中，对外友协邀请并接待了来自五大洲的各国朋友近200批，派出各种访问团组近30批，举行各种大型活动30多次，会见临时来访外宾数千人。此外，又有十几对中外城市缔结了友好关系。
    今年的对外民间交往具有以下几个特点：（一）尽管受到“6.4”风波的影响，下半年来访的各国朋友仍络绎不绝，达近百批。除友好访问外，也有不少是来华进行专业考察交流的，其中包括由美国癌症协会会长及意大利——中国商会主席等率领的专业访问团。今年国庆期间，朝鲜、日本、苏联、美国、多哥等国的十几个友好代表团来访，是近年来国庆期间在京外宾较多的一年。（二）与第三世界国家的交往和友谊进一步加强。来自非洲各国的朋友增多。以印中协会秘书长、国会议员拉特德为团长的印中协会代表团等印度朋友访华，反映了印度人民要求发展两国友好关系的良好愿望。中国人民的老朋友、泰国总理差猜·春哈旺阁下以政府总理和泰中友协会长的双重身份访华，并在对外友协、中泰友协举行的欢迎招待会上发表了热情洋溢的讲话，可以说反映了“泰中非外人、本是一家亲”这一泰国美好诗句的真谛。（三）在继续发展与日本、西欧、北美、大洋洲各国民间友好交往的同时，随着中苏关系的正常化，与苏联、东欧各国的互访交流进一步增多。以阿尔希波夫为团长、由曾经帮助过中国的革命和建设事业的老朋友组成的苏联老战士代表团来访，体现了中苏两国人民之间的传统友谊。
  （四）重大纪念活动比较多。例如，今年不仅是新中国成立四十周年，而且是我国与苏、保、罗、朝、捷、匈、民德等10个社会主义国家建交40周年；今年还是伟大的国际主义战士白求恩大夫逝世五十周年；纳米比亚人民经过长期反殖斗争即将获得独立以及巴勒斯坦国的诞生也使今年的“纳米比亚日”和“声援巴勒斯坦人民国际日”纪念活动意义非凡。此外，今年还是对外友协从事民间外交三十五周年。
  （五）党和国家领导人对民间外交工作十分重视，中央主要领导同志多次会见国际友人，亲自做民间友好工作，许多外国朋友为此深为感动，表示将为进一步发展对华友好而作更大的努力。
    无庸讳言，今年春夏之交在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱对我国民间外交工作是一次严峻的考验。由于一些西方宣传媒介的歪曲报道甚至制造谣言，在国际社会掀起了一股反华的逆流，使一些多年从事对华友好的组织和人士在工作中遇到不少新困难。即使这样，大多数国家的对华友好组织和人士坚持与中国人民友好的信念并没有动摇。一些友好组织领导人给我们来信，对中国政府为平息暴乱而采取的果断措施表示理解和支持。在与我建立的300多个外国友好省市中，80％以上不受这次风波的影响，他们与我对口友好省市的各项交流照常进行。但是，我们也看到，这股逆流确实给部分国家的对华友好组织、城市和各界朋友造成一定的心理冲击和压力。一些朋友在致友协的函电中，对我国内形势表示忧虑和不理解。为此，及时地通过各种途径向各国朋友做耐心的宣传解释，澄清事实真相，使中国人民与世界各国人民经过多年努力而建立起来的相互了解和友谊不受到损害，成为对外友协、1989年工作的一项重要内容。
    6月28日，对外友协在致各国对华友好人士和团体的公开信中，指出了这次事件的性质，重申了中国人民继续保持和发展与各国对华友好团体、友好组织和各界人士的合作与交流的愿望。7月份以后，一批批外国友人应邀来华访问，亲眼看一看到底在中国发生了什么事情。他们在北京与市政府官员、学校师生、戒严部队等各个方面进行了深入座谈，并观看录像、到现场参观访问。不少朋友还直接听到了中国领导人对事件真相的情况介绍。大量翔实的资料和活生生的现实使许多朋友解开了心中的疑团，他们对中国政府所采取的果断措施表示尊重和理解。
    “6.4”风波后的事实表明，由中国人民与世界各国人民经过长期努力而培养发展起来的友谊是有着深厚的基础的，是经得起任何风浪的考验的。这不但可以从第三世界国家人民对我们的支持和理解得到体现，也可以从日本各界友好人士要求继续推进日中友好事业的鲜明态度得到印证。日中友协宇都宫德马会长今年8月访华时，特意将儿子、孙子一起带来，并对李鹏总理说，这是为了使日中两国子子孙孙都能友好下去。日中友好议员联盟伊东正义会长9月份访华时表示，他完全同意邓小平主席的看法，不管国际上有什么变化，也不管日本和中国国内有什么变化，日中友好不能变，也不会变。在11月份于东京举行的第四次中日民间友好交流会议上，双方民间人士就在当前形势下如何开展友好交往充分交换了意见，取得了一致看法。即使是在欧美各国，也有许许多多坚持对华友好、仗义执言的朋友。“英中了解”协会的一位朋友来信说，我们不了解所有的真相，不过我们确实知道，在我们的“自由媒介”的支持下，中国确有反革命势力想兴风作浪。一位美中友协的老朋友访华后表示，尽管可能遭到指责和挑战，回去后仍将努力将真相告诉人们。中国人民对各国友人的宝贵支持是十分感谢的。当然，我们也注意到，由于种种原因，仍然有部分朋友对这场风波持有这样或那样的不同看法。这也没有关系，我们仍然将他们看成是中国人民的朋友，并相信，随着中国改革开放事业的不断发展，这部分朋友也会自己得出公正的结论的。我们相信，即将到来的二十世纪九十年代，将是中国社会主义现代化事业取得长足发展的年代，也将是我国民间外交的百花园结出累累硕果的年代。
