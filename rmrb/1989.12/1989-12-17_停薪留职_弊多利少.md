The concept of "unpaid leave with job retention" was intended to reform the rigid and outdated system of managing permanent workers, providing some employees with the opportunity to showcase their talents and offering enterprises a new way to manage surplus workers. However, in practice, the drawbacks of this system have become increasingly apparent and warrant serious study and resolution. The main issues are as follows:

First, it is detrimental to fair competition among employees in the same industry. Employees who take "unpaid leave with job retention" continue to enjoy the medical, pension, and other labor insurance benefits of their original state-owned enterprises, while also benefiting from state subsidies for collective enterprises or individual business owners. In times of risk, they can apply to return to their jobs, giving them an advantage over other industry employees. Some state-owned enterprise employees who take "unpaid leave with job retention" pay a small amount of "seniority gold" to continuously accrue their seniority. This has caused significant dissatisfaction and strong reactions among both in-service employees and employees of collective enterprises and individual business owners.

Second, it is detrimental to correcting improper practices. Employees on "unpaid leave with job retention" are detached from the enterprise collective and lack disciplinary constraints, making them more susceptible to political and ideological decline. Some of these individuals exploit their past business connections to build relationships and take shortcuts, disrupting normal production and business operations between enterprises and contributing to the spread of various improper practices and corruption. Some employees on "unpaid leave with job retention" engage in illegal business activities to make money, leading to frequent violations of regulations and crimes, becoming a factor of social instability.

Third, it is detrimental to enterprise management and the ideological education of enterprise employees. Since most employees on "unpaid leave with job retention" earn more in economic activities than in-service employees, this creates a new phenomenon of social inequality, demoralizing in-service employees. Moreover, some employees on "unpaid leave with job retention" recklessly pursue wealth, and when they encounter work-related injuries, they return to the enterprise, adding to the management difficulties of the enterprise.

### “停薪留职”弊多利少

    “停薪留职”弊多利少
    “停薪留职”从劳动人事制度改革的本意看，可以改变固定工管理僵化古板的模式，为一部分职工施展自己的才能创造条件，也为企业安排富余职工开辟了新的渠道。但从实践来看，实行“停薪留职”的弊端越来越突出，值得认真研究解决。主要表现在以下方面：
    一、不利于同行业职工的平等竞争。凡“停薪留职”后的职工，仍享受原国营企业的医疗、养老等劳动保险待遇，又享受国家对集体企业或个体工商户的优惠；遇到风险，还可申请复职，使他们在与同行业人员竞争中处于优势。有些国营企业的“停薪留职”职工交纳少量“工龄金”，就能连续计算工龄。对此，无论在职职工还是集体企业职工、个体工商户都意见较大，反响强烈。
    二、不利于纠正不正之风。“停薪留职”职工，脱离了企业集体，失去纪律约束，在政治思想上容易走下坡路。他们中的有些人，利用过去的业务联系，拉关系，走后门，既影响企业之间正常的生产业务和经营活动，又助长了社会上各种不正之风和腐败现象的蔓延。有些“停薪留职”职工为赚钱搞各种非法的经营活动，违纪违法犯罪现象屡有发生，成为社会的不安定因素之一。
    三、不利于企业管理和企业职工的思想教育工作。由于“停薪留职”职工多数在经济活动中收入高于企业在职职工，造成一种新的社会分配不公现象，涣散了在职职工的思想。特别是有些“停薪留职”职工，不顾一切拚命赚钱，出了工伤事故又找到企业，增加了企业管理的困难。（12月6日《中国劳动报》廖兴铭　李金明　刘凤申文）
