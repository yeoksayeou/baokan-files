The official newspaper of Burma, the "New Light of Myanmar," published a statement from the Multi-Party Democracy Commission on the 12th, announcing that ten political parties had dissolved themselves on the 11th.

There are a total of 235 legally registered political parties in Burma participating in the elections. However, by the 11th, 42 political parties had dissolved themselves, and 3 were banned by the Election Commission for having ties with illegal organizations. An article in the "New Light of Myanmar" stated that parties that have registered but do not participate in the democratic elections to be held next May will face legal sanctions from the government.

The Election Commission recently stipulated that registered political parties must participate in the elections in at least three constituencies. Many small parties will have to dissolve themselves due to lack of political influence and insufficient election funds.

    缅甸十个政党自行解散
    缅甸官方的《劳动人民日报》十二日刊登了多党民主大选委员会的一项声明，宣布十一日有十个政党自行解散。
    缅甸合法登记参加大选的政党共二百三十五个。但到十一日止，已有四十二个政党自行解散，有三个因与非法组织有牵连而　被大选委员会取缔。　《劳动人民日报》刊载的一篇文章说，进行了登记而不参加明年五月举行的民主大选的政党将受到政府的法律制裁。
    大选委员会最近规定，进行登记的政党至少必须参加三个选区的竞选。许多小政党将由于没有政治影响，缺少竞选资金而不得不自行解散。
