Visiting rural areas, one can clearly feel that farmers' lives have indeed improved compared to the past. However, farmers also have a lot of complaints. There are complaints about cadres using their power for personal gain, about the poor service attitude of the seven stations and eight offices in the countryside, about price increases, about unfair distribution of agricultural supplies, about arbitrary levies, and about the disorderly social order in the locality, and so on.

Farmers may have many complaints, but in some places, there are few cadres who can seriously listen to farmers' opinions, and even fewer who will seriously address them after listening. Some farmers living in relatively remote areas rarely see leaders from the township level and above. "The sky is high and the emperor is far away," they have complaints but nowhere to express them, or even if they do, they cannot be resolved, which makes them very unhappy. This is an important reason for the tense relations between cadres and the masses in some villages.

Is there a way to gather farmers' opinions and study and solve them? Yes, there is. According to a report in the Farmers' Daily, Xiaoying Township in Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, has established farmers' consultation rooms in all ten villages. The 15th and 30th of each month are designated as consultation days, during which farmers can come to the consultation room to discuss any opinions or difficulties they have. Each consultation is presided over by township and county people's representatives, who also report to the farmers on the progress of the previous consultation items. This way, farmers have a channel to express their opinions, which promotes the transformation of cadres' work style and work efficiency, especially attracting farmers to participate in politics, easing the relations between cadres and the masses, and maintaining stability and unity.

The method of Xiaoying Township is, of course, just one form and may not be suitable for every township and village. The key is to establish the idea and style of seriously listening to farmers' opinions. For comrades working in rural areas, whether or not they have this idea and style, the work efficiency and results will be very different. The fundamental way to develop agriculture is to mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers. By every possible means, providing farmers with opportunities to speak and opening up venues for them to speak, forming a system for listening to farmers' opinions, and solving the problems that farmers generally care about, farmers will be happy and will have boundless enthusiasm.

    多多听取农民意见
    潘发艺
    到农村去有一个明显的感觉，就是农民的生活比以往确实好了，但农民的意见也真不少，有对干部以权谋私的，有对农村七所八站服务态度恶劣的，有对物价上涨的，有对农用物资分配不公的，有对乱摊派的，还有对当地社会秩序混乱的，等等。
    农民的意见虽多，但一些地方能认真听听农民意见的干部却不多，听了之后认真解决的就更少。一些居住比较偏僻的农民难得见到乡以上的领导，“天高皇帝远”，有意见没处说，或者提了也解决不了，心里很不痛快。这是造成一些乡村干群关系紧张的一个重要原因。
    有没有办法把农民的意见集中起来，并加以研究解决呢？有。据农民日报报道：江苏省淮阴县小营乡在全乡十个村普遍建立了农民议事室，每月15日、30日定为议事日，农民有啥意见，有啥难题，都可到议事室来谈。每次议事都有乡、县人民代表主持，并向农民通报上次所议事项的办理情况。这样一来，农民有了提意见的渠道，促进了干部作风的转变和工作效率的提高，尤其是吸引了农民议政、参政，缓解了干群关系，维护了安定团结。
    小营乡的办法，当然只是一种形式，未必乡乡如此，村村如此。关键是要树立认真听取农民意见的思想和作风；对于在农村工作的同志来说，有没有这种思想和作风，工作效率和工作成果都是大不一样的。发展农业的根本就是要调动农民的积极性。千方百计为农民提供说话的机会，开辟说话的场所，形成一套听取农民意见的制度，把农民普遍关心的问题解决好，农民就会高兴，就会增添无穷的干劲。
