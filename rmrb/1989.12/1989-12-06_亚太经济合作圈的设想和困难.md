Recently, the idea of an Asia-Pacific economic cooperation circle has moved beyond mere discussions and has taken a significant step forward. In early November, the ministerial-level representatives of 12 Pacific Rim countries met in Canberra, Australia, marking the beginning of efforts to establish an economic cooperation circle in the Asia-Pacific region.

Throughout the 1980s, the Asia-Pacific region experienced the fastest economic growth in the world. According to reports from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the average economic growth rate in Europe and America was 4%, in Latin America it was 3%, in Africa it was 2.5%, while in the Asia-Pacific region it was 7%. From a trade perspective, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for one-third of the world's total trade volume, and its trade growth rate was higher than the global average. It is estimated that in the 1990s, the Asia-Pacific trade volume could approach half of the world's total trade volume. The Asia-Pacific region has become one of the world's three major trade zones, alongside the European Community and North America. Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Matsunaga Mitsuru stated that by the year 2000, the economic activities in the Asia-Pacific region, measured in U.S. dollars, would increase by 60%, surpassing the European Community by a factor of two. However, as the trend towards economic regionalization continues to develop, various regional blocs with trade protectionist tendencies pose an increasing threat to non-member countries. The emergence of trade blocs in Western Europe and North America has made it imperative for other countries to seek regional cooperation to safeguard their interests. Against this backdrop, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed holding an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, aiming to establish a cooperation mechanism centered around Australia.

Australia, with a population of only 16 million, has a highly developed beef, wool processing, coal and iron ore mining, and agricultural industries. Facing the formation of various protectionist trade blocs, Australia's traditional export products are under serious threat. On the other hand, the Asia-Pacific region currently absorbs 50% of Australia's exports and 60% of its foreign investments, coupled with the region's promising development prospects, Australia naturally seeks to promote the formation of an Asia-Pacific economic cooperation region to offset the negative impacts of the European Community, North America, and ASEAN on its economy.

The United States and Japan also support the idea of an Asia-Pacific economic cooperation circle, but their motivations differ.

Japan is wary of the European Community's 1992 single market and the North American Free Trade Area, as evidenced by Japan's current large-scale investments on both sides of the Atlantic. To counterbalance the European and American trade blocs, Japan needs to expand its sphere of influence. In fact, Japanese scholars and high-ranking officials had proposed similar ideas in the 1960s and 1970s, but these were rejected by Southeast Asian countries as a revival of Japan's imperial "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

The United States is also highly interested in the Asia-Pacific economic circle, primarily to limit Japan's expansion of influence, compete for the Asia-Pacific market, and exert political control over the region. Last year, the total trade volume between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region reached $271 billion, significantly higher than its Atlantic trade volume of $186 billion. Out of the 20 key export regions for U.S. companies, 8 are in the Asia-Pacific. U.S. investments in the Asia-Pacific exceed $33 billion, and profits from the Asia-Pacific region account for one-third of the total profits of U.S. overseas companies. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker has stated that any cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region must include the United States. This indirectly warns Japan not to act unilaterally in the Asia-Pacific without U.S. involvement.

The six ASEAN countries are well aware of the true intentions of the United States, Japan, and Australia, and thus have been highly cautious about the establishment of an "Asian version of the OECD." On one hand, ASEAN countries believe that strengthening Asia-Pacific economic cooperation is beneficial for countering European and American trade protectionism, maintaining their interests in important international economic and trade forums, expanding export-oriented economies, and enhancing their negotiating positions with Europe and America. On the other hand, they are concerned that in any future Asia-Pacific economic circle, ASEAN might become a pawn for the United States, Japan, and Australia, and that the political and economic influence of ASEAN might become insignificant. Therefore, before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in early November, ASEAN considered the proposal for nine months before formally agreeing to Hawke's suggestion to participate in the meeting. During the meeting, representatives from Malaysia and Indonesia emphasized that in expanding Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, the unique characteristics of ASEAN must be preserved, and ASEAN must hold a significant position. To this end, representatives from the United States, Japan, and Australia repeatedly explained at the meeting that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss multilateral cooperation, not to create a controlling mechanism, and that all decisions made at the meeting would be based on consensus.

In summary, the vision for future Asia-Pacific economic cooperation is an inevitable trend, but there are differing views among the relevant countries and regions on when this vision will be realized. Countries and regions such as Australia, the United States, Japan, and South Korea hope to realize this vision as soon as possible. However, ASEAN countries are more cautious. They advocate that before the final realization of the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation circle, industrialized countries within the Asia-Pacific region should help developing countries and regions, narrow the economic and technological gaps between developed and developing countries, promote information exchange, and lay the foundation for establishing new cooperation mechanisms.

It is believed that considering the differences in motivations and views among the relevant parties, achieving the vision of an Asia-Pacific economic cooperation circle, establishing and perfecting various principles and specific regulations, will face many difficulties and require a great deal of work. As stated by Nuruddin, Director of the Malaysian Institute of Strategic and International Studies, "This will be a thick book, filled with twists and turns and chapters of difficulty."

### 亚太经济合作圈的设想和困难

    亚太经济合作圈的设想和困难
    息曙光
    最近一个时期，有关亚太经济合作圈的设想已不再是停留在纸上、嘴上，而且还扎扎实实地迈出了艰难的一步。11月上旬在澳大利亚首都堪培拉举行的环太平洋12国部长级代表会议，可以说拉开了筹建亚太地区经济合作圈的序幕。
    整个80年代，亚太是全世界经济增长最快的地区，据国际货币基金组织和世界银行的报告，在这10年中，欧美经济平均增长率为4％，拉美为3％，非洲为2.5％，而亚太地区则为7％。从贸易的角度看，亚太地区贸易额占世界贸易总额的1／3，贸易增长速度更高于全球贸易的平均增长速度。估计在90年代，亚太贸易额可接近世界贸易总额的一半左右。亚太地区已是同欧共体、北美并列的世界三大贸易区。日本通商产业相松永光说，到公元2000年，以美元计算的亚太区的经济活动将增长六成，将比那时的欧共体高出一倍。但是随着世界经济区域集团化趋势不断发展，一个个带有贸易保护色彩的地区集团也对非区域集团内国家构成了日益明显的威胁，特别是西欧和北美贸易集团的出现更使其他国家感到了通过集团化来维护自身利益的紧迫性。在这种背景下，澳大利亚总理霍克首先倡议召开亚太经合会议，试图建立一个以澳大利亚为中心的合作机制。
    澳大利亚人口只有1600万，它的牛羊肉、毛加工业、煤铁矿开发和农业却十分发达。面临着正在形成的多种保护性贸易集团，澳大利亚传统的出口产品受到严重威胁；另一方面，亚太地区目前吸收了澳大利亚的50％的出口和澳对外投资的60％，再加上亚太诱人的发展前景，澳大利亚自然要大力通过撮合亚太经济合作区域集团来抵消欧共体、北美和东盟对其经济的消极影响。
    美国和日本也赞成亚太经济合作圈的设想，但动机各异。
    日本对欧共体1992年统一大市场和北美自由贸易区是怀有戒心的，这一点可以从日本目前大量向大西洋两岸投资这一事实看出来。为了抗衡欧美贸易区，日本需要扩大自己的势力范围。实际上日本学者和政府高级官员早在60、70年代就曾提出过类似的建议，但已被东南亚国家视为当年日本帝国“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版而予以拒绝。
    美国对亚太经济圈的设想也十分关注，它的主要目的是为了限制日本势力范围的扩张，争夺亚太市场，并在政治上控制这一地区。去年美国同亚太地区的贸易总额已达到2710亿美元，大大高于它同大西洋贸易总额的1860亿美元。美国公司的20个重点出口地区中就有8个在亚太，美国在亚太的投资超过330亿美元，从亚太地区获得的利润收入占美国海外公司利润总收入的1／3。美国国务卿贝克曾声称，亚太地区的任何合作必须有美国参加。这就间接地警告日本不得撇开美国而在亚太单独行动。
    东盟六国对美日澳的良苦用心自然是十分清楚的，所以它一开始就对成立亚洲版的“经合组织”抱有强烈的戒心。东盟一方面认为，加强亚太经济合作对它们抵消欧美贸易保护主义打击，在一些重要的国际经贸场合中维护自身利益，扩展出口导向型经济，并增强同欧美贸易谈判的地位是有利的，另一方面它们也担心，在未来任何可能的亚太经济圈中，东盟会为美日澳“作嫁衣裳”，沦为他人垫脚石，并使东盟政治经济影响变得无足轻重。所以，在11月初亚太经合会议开会前，东盟考虑了9个月才正式同意霍克的建议，参加了会议。在会上，马来西亚和印尼代表都强调，在扩大亚太经济合作时，应保留东盟特性，东盟必须占有举足轻重的地位。为此，美日澳代表多次在会上向东盟解释，这次会议是讨论多边合作，不是为了产生控制机构，会议任何决定都以共识为基础。
    综上所述，对未来亚太经济合作的设想从总的方向来说是一个难以阻挡的趋势，但对何时实现这一设想，有关国家和地区却存在着不同的看法。澳大利亚、美国、日本、南朝鲜等国家和地区都希望尽快实现这一设想。而东盟国家却对此比较审慎。它们呼吁在最后实现亚太经济合作圈之前，亚太区域内的工业化国家应帮助发展中国家和地区，缩小发达国家和发展中国家之间的经济技术差距，促进信息交流，为建立新合作机制打下基础。
    人们认为，考虑到有关各方动机和观点上的差异，要实现亚太经济合作圈的设想，建立、健全各项原则和具体规章还有许多困难，还需做大量的工作。正像马来西亚国际战略研究所主任努尔丁所说，“这将是一本厚书，充满了曲折和困难的篇章。”
