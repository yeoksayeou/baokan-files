Using coal to synthesize gasoline, as a fuel for automobiles, has become a reality. This new type of fuel, coal-based synthetic oil, recently entered the intermediate trial phase in Shanxi and has passed expert appraisal.

The direct synthesis of gasoline from carbon monoxide and hydrogen is a major scientific and technological breakthrough project of the state's "Seventh Five-Year Plan." It was developed by the Shanxi Coal Chemistry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences over a period of nine years. Experts believe that its success has opened up a new path for alleviating fuel shortages in China and fully utilizing Shanxi's coal resources.
