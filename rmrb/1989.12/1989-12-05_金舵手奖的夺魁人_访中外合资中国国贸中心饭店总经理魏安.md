The gleaming 1989 Golden Helm Award has been brought home. Colleagues at the Sino-foreign joint venture Beijing China International Trade Center congratulated Swiss national Wei An, the hotel's general manager. This is the Oscar of the international tourism industry. Wei An is the first winner in China.

This middle-aged man, who graduated from the Swiss Hotel Management School in Lausanne, spent over 20 years in top hotels in Switzerland, London, Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia, and other places. In 1985, he came to Beijing to serve as the opening general manager of the Sino-foreign joint venture Beijing Shangri-La Hotel. Some people call him the foreign general manager hired by the international Shangri-La Hotel Group, but he says, "No, I am the general manager of both Chinese and foreign parties. I am the general manager of the entire hotel. My goal with my Chinese colleagues is to manage a good hotel."

In the autumn of October, I met him. He talked about the management of the hotel:

"The hotel industry is a service industry and also the most challenging industry. The facilities of the hotel are indeed important, but the key to success lies in management and the quality of the staff. Luxurious facilities may attract customers the first time. But when they wait for a long time in a grand hall and do not receive good service, the luxury cannot dispel their sense of coldness. If they stay and feel uncomfortable, they will return to hotels with less advanced facilities but better service."

Although the Shangri-La Hotel emerged after several famous hotels in Beijing, in just three years, its reputation has grown, making it both a first-class facility and a first-class service. Almost everywhere in the hotel, the talent and hard work of this opening general manager are evident.

Inspection, his management style

Wei An said, "I like to go to the scene, to the customers, this is my management style. As a senior manager, when you go down, it is both a supervision and a comfort to the employees, making them feel the care of the general manager. Especially in the backstage service departments such as the kitchen, warehouse, and laundry, they do not have the opportunity to contact customers, but they are not unimportant. My visit to them is a great encouragement."

Once, in the lobby, he suddenly saw a German customer shouting angrily. It turned out that the customer's wool coat, which should have been dry-cleaned, was washed with water and shrank a lot. Wei An quickly went up to ask about the reason, apologized to him, and invited him to the bar for a drink, gradually calming him down, and then compensated him appropriately. Wei An said, "The key is not in the compensation, but the customer's beloved coat was damaged, and his feelings were hurt, which money cannot compensate for. You, the general manager, are present and personally handle the matter, making the customer feel that his problem has been noticed by the senior management, making it easier to gain his understanding. The second time that customer came, he greeted me in the lobby, and that unpleasant incident became a topic of our conversation, and we even became friends because of it."

In his more than 20 years of hotel career, Wei An has been a waiter, chef, restaurant manager, banquet manager, and later became a general manager. He can spot problems with a glance at the scene. He said, "One day I went to the restaurant and saw a customer struggling to cut a steak, muttering, 'This is not a steak, it's a tendon.' I immediately had someone replace it for him and apologized." Another time, in the restaurant, he glanced and saw that the customer's cream cabbage had a problem, and the next day at the department manager meeting, he said, "You can't give the old cabbage to the customer." And humorously gestured with his hand: half of the cabbage fibers went into the customer's stomach, and half were still hanging on his chest. Under his leadership, no one dares to deceive him.

He said, "Please don't misunderstand, I am not doing everything myself. Each department has its own responsibilities and work plans, but after the work is assigned and the rules and regulations are set, you have to follow up and check. The style of the general manager can bring out the style of the department managers. Everyone goes to the scene, united from top to bottom, and supervises each other. The hotel is entrusted to me, and I will do my best."

Except for sleeping, he is almost always working. Therefore, he got a nickname: "workaholic."

Understanding, a good friend of the Chinese side

"You have been in China for 4 years, are you satisfied with your Chinese partners? What is your view on China's investment environment?" I asked.

He smiled and said, "If I were not satisfied, I would not have stayed so long. However, when I first came, I was not adapted. Later, I thought, China is reforming, reform cannot be completed overnight, I should try to adapt."

When talking about Chinese partners, he got along well with the deputy general manager sent by the China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation and others, and these people were not from the hotel industry. Wei An said, "Chinese people are smart, they learn fast, and soon they get into the role. Our consensus is that both sides are not working for their own side. Of course, there will be different opinions and troubles, we will exchange ideas and discuss how to do things."

The former deputy general manager of Shangri-La Hotel, now chairman Li Lingyan, mentioned such an incident. Wei An, according to Western understanding, was originally not at ease with the establishment of trade unions and other organizations in the hotel. He once told Li, "Never establish a trade union, you will be in trouble." Li patiently explained, "The Chinese trade union is not an organization that opposes the hotel, but helps the work." Wei An saw the role of the trade union in practice, he understood, and told Li, "They are doing a good job."

What if there is a dispute between Chinese and foreign personnel? Wei An said, "Some foreign personnel look down on Chinese colleagues, I found out and had to tell them, to understand that the Chinese hotel industry is just starting, to have more patience. I also talked to Chinese colleagues, to let them understand that the best hotel, management should be stricter, do not always argue with foreign colleagues. In this way, both sides communicate." Once, a foreign chef scolded a Chinese chef, Wei An talked to him twice, but he became more aggressive, and once even kicked a Chinese chef, Wei An fired him. Another time, Chinese chefs quarreled, Wei An also fired them. He said, "Chinese and foreign sides are treated equally, they cannot quarrel during work hours, beat people."

Obsession, the honor is well-deserved

The International Tourism Golden Helm Award is awarded once a year. In the past 15 years, 1260 people from five continents have won the award. Wei An's victory this year can be said to be well-deserved. Not only in Beijing Shangri-La Hotel, but also in Fiji and Malaysia, he is an outstanding first-class hotel manager. Now he faces a greater challenge. The total construction area of the China International Trade Center reaches 420,000 square meters, including China Grand Hotel, CITIC Hotel, Exhibition Center, International Conference Center, Office Building, Apartment, etc. He was transferred to be the general manager of the first four parts, which will soon open, and it is enough for him to "inspect." I asked, "The role of hotel manager is not easy, with your talent and energy, have you ever thought of doing something else?" He said, "When I was tired of work, I also thought about it, but I still like to manage hotels. The hotel industry is always a fresh industry, dealing with people, everyone is different, every day you can encounter new things, every day you can see the results of your work." He joked, "In Beijing, if Shangri-La Hotel is my first home, then the CITIC Center is my second home."

I was truly attracted by this sincere friend of the Chinese people, this foreign "workaholic" with such a strong sense of duty.

    金舵手奖的夺魁人
    ——访中外合资中国国贸中心饭店总经理魏安
    本报记者　计泓赓
    金光灿灿的1989年金舵手奖捧回来了。中外合资北京中国国际贸易中心的同事们欣喜地向瑞士籍的饭店总经理魏安祝贺。这是国际旅游行业的奥斯卡奖。魏安是迄今第一位在中国的获奖人。
    这位毕业于瑞士洛桑旅游学院的中年人，在瑞士、伦敦、加拿大、菲律宾、马来西亚等第一流饭店度过了20多个春秋。1985年来到北京，首任中外合资北京香格里拉饭店开业总经理。有人称他是合资者一方国际香格里拉饭店集团聘来的外方总经理，他却说：“不，我是中外双方的总经理，是整个饭店的总经理。我和中国同事共同目标是：管理出一个好的饭店来。”
    金秋10月，我见到了他。他侃侃地谈了饭店的管理之道：
    “饭店是服务性行业，也是最富挑战性的行业。饭店的设施固然重要，但成功的关键在于管理，在于人员的素质。设施豪华，也许第一次能把客人吸引来。但当他在富丽堂皇的大厅里等了好多分钟，得不到良好的服务，豪华就不能打消他的冷遇感。他住下了，感到不舒适，就会回到设施并不先进而服务称心的饭店去。”
    香格里拉饭店尽管崛起于北京一些著名的大饭店之后，但短短三年，声誉日增，称得上既有第一流的设备，又有第一流的服务。这里几乎处处凝聚着这位开业总经理的才华和心血。
    巡回，他的管理风格
    魏安说：“我喜欢到现场去，到客人中间去，这是我的管理风格。作为高层经理，你下去了，对员工既是一种监督，也是一种安慰，使他们感到总经理的关心。特别是在后台服务的如厨房、仓库、洗衣等部门，没机会接触客人，但并非不重要，我去那里对他们是很大的鼓励。”
    一次，他在大厅，忽然见到一位德国客人怒气冲冲，大喊大叫。原来客人一件羊绒大衣，该干洗的搞成水洗了，一下抽缩了好多。魏安急忙上前问清原因，向他道歉，并请他到酒吧喝饮料，使客人慢慢消了气，又酌情给以赔偿。魏安说：“关键不在赔偿，而是客人心爱的大衣洗坏了，感情受到伤害，是金钱无法弥补的。你总经理在场，亲自处理这件事，使客人感到他的问题已经引起高层管理者的重视，就容易取得他的谅解。第二次那位客人又来了，在大厅主动招呼我，那件不愉快的事成为我们谈话的笑料，我们竟因此成为朋友。”
    魏安在20多年饭店生涯中，当过服务员、厨师、餐厅主管、宴会经理，后来才当的总经理。他到现场用眼睛一扫，就能发现问题。他说：“一天我转到餐厅，见一位客人正费劲地在切牛排，并嘟囔说：‘这哪是牛排，是牛筋。’我立即叫人给他换了一块，并表示歉意。”又一次，他在餐厅一眼瞥见客人吃的奶油白菜有问题，就在第二天的部门经理会上说：“不能把老的白菜给客人吃。”并幽默地用手比划着：白菜纤维一半进了客人肚子，一半还挂在胸前呢。在他手下工作，谁也别想糊弄他。
    他说：“请不要误会，我并不是包办代替。各部门都有各自的职责和工作计划，但工作布置了，规章制度订下了，就要跟踪、检查。总经理的风格能带出部门经理的风格。大家都到现场去，上下一条心，互相监督。饭店交给我，我就要尽心尽职。”
    除了睡觉外，他几乎成天都在工作。由此，他得了个雅号：“工作迷”。
    理解，中方的好朋友
    “你到中国4年了，你对中方合作者满意吗？你对中国的投资环境有何看法？”我问。
    他笑笑说：“不满意我不会呆那么久。不过刚来时，我是不适应。后来我想，中国在改革，改革不能一下子完成，我应尽量适应。”
    谈到中方合作者，他与中国五金矿产进出口公司派来的副总经理等相处得很好，而这些人都不是搞饭店出身的。魏安说：“中国人很聪明，学得快，很快就进入角色。我们的共识是双方都不是为各自一方工作。当然也会有不同意见，会碰到麻烦，我们就交换意见，商量办事。”
    香格里拉饭店原副总经理、现任董事长李令言谈起这样一件事。魏安按西方理解，原来对饭店成立工会等组织不放心。他曾对李说：“千万不要成立工会，你会倒霉的。”李耐心解释：“中国工会不是专跟店方作对的，而是帮助工作的。”魏安从实际中看到了工会的作用，他理解了，对李说：“他们是干得不错。”
    中外方人员之间发生了纠纷怎么办？魏安说：“有的外方人员瞧不起中国同事，我发现了就要对他们说，要理解中国饭店业刚刚在起步，要拿出更大的耐心来。我也和中国同事谈心，要他们理解最好的饭店，管理应该更严，不要老和外国同事顶牛。这样双方就沟通了。”有一个外籍厨师长老对中方厨师发脾气，魏安曾找他谈了两次，不料他变本加厉，一次竟踢了中方厨师一脚，魏安就把他解雇了。另一次，中方厨师之间吵架，魏安也把他们解雇了。他说：“中外方一视同仁，工作时间不能吵架，打人。”
    入迷，荣誉当之无愧
    国际旅游金舵手奖一年一评。15年来五大洲已先后有1260人获奖。魏安今年夺魁可说当之无愧。不光北京香格里拉饭店，他在斐济、马来西亚也是出色的第一流饭店的总经理。现在他面临更大的挑战。总建筑面积达42万平方米的中国国际贸易中心，内设中国大饭店、国贸饭店、展览中心、国际会议中心、办公大厦、公寓等，他被调去担任前四个部分的总经理，不久将全部开业，真够他“巡回”的。我问：“饭店总经理角色不好当，凭你的才华和干劲，难道没有想过要干点别的什么？”他说：“工作劳累时也曾想过，但我还是喜欢管饭店。饭店永远是个有新鲜感的行业，与人打交道，每个人都不一样，每天都能碰到新鲜事，每天都可看到工作成果。”他诙谐地说：“在北京，如果香格里拉饭店是我第一个家，那么国贸中心便是我第二个家了。”
    我真被这位中国人民真诚的朋友，这位有如此强烈事业心的外国“工作迷”所深深吸引住了。
