The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and government have consistently worked to do practical things for the people, which is moving; the enthusiasm and energy the people have shown after feeling the warmth of the Party and government are also deeply touching. With such a close relationship between the Party and the people, the various undertakings led by the Party will undoubtedly progress faster.

Doing practical things for the people and letting them feel and understand that the Party and government are "for the people, by the people" is a characteristic of Tianjin's Party and government work, and it is also a characteristic of many of our Party organizations and governments. The Party's purpose is to "serve the people wholeheartedly." The process of the Party's establishment and growth, to a certain extent, is the process of letting the people feel and understand the Party's purpose. When the Party's cause encounters obstacles and work goes wrong, it is often because we have deviated from or violated the purpose of "serving the people." It can be said that doing practical things for the people is a fine tradition of our Party and also the fundamental task of our Party. No matter what, our Party can only inherit and carry forward this tradition, not weaken it, and certainly not abandon it.

To do practical things for the people, Party and government cadres must always pay attention to understanding the people's voices and sentiments, and genuinely help them solve problems and give them benefits. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Our first task is not to ask the people for things, but to give things to the people." "Only after we have done this work and achieved results can we do the second task—asking the people for things—and gain their support." "Only when our comrades understand and carry out the coordination of these two tasks can we be considered a complete communist revolutionary."

Looking back at the achievements and mistakes of the past few years, we can find experiences and lessons in the construction of work style and ideological construction from the people's sentiments. When encountering difficulties, comrades who blame the people for not supporting enough should reflect on themselves and may find that they have bureaucratism and do not care enough for the people. As for those who not only do not pay attention to giving things to the people but also always ask the people for things, sometimes to raise funds for this, sometimes to raise funds for that, it is natural that they are criticized and opposed by the people!

To do practical things for the people, one must be willing to do them. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, in wind and rain, from basic living problems to other aspects of needs, practical things are everywhere; the people's hearts are simple, and their demands are generally not high, and some things are not difficult to do. The difficulty lies in establishing a conscious and persistent "servant" consciousness and consciously doing practical things. As long as our comrades always remember the purpose of "serving the people wholeheartedly," solving one problem after another and doing one thing after another, they will surely gain the support and support of the broadest masses of the people. On this basis, even if some things cannot be done immediately or cannot be done for various reasons, explaining the situation to the people can also be understood.

Communist Party members have no interests different from the entire proletariat and the masses of the people. Party cadres doing more practical things for the people and continuously improving the level of doing practical things can unite the people "to struggle for their own interests." In this sense, the people are the most lovable; as long as they genuinely feel the consistency of the Party and the people's interests, they will resolutely follow the Party: the people are the most respectable; once their enthusiasm is aroused, they will enthusiastically "work hard" for the Party and government, and many difficult obstacles will be overcome; the people are also the most formidable, without the understanding and support of the people, almost nothing can be done.

Doing practical things for the people seems to be just a matter of work style, but in fact, it concerns the close relationship between the Party and the people, which is a big issue related to the nature of the Party. Every Party member, especially Party cadres, should always remember to "talk less and do more."

    多为群众办实事
    本报评论员
    天津市委、市政府坚持为群众办实事，读来感人；群众在感受到党和政府的温暖之后所暴发出的热情和干劲，也感人至深。有了这种密切的党群关系，党领导的各项事业无疑都会前进得更快。
    为群众办实事，让群众感受和认识到党和政府“一切为了人民，一切依靠人民”，是天津市党和政府的工作特色，也是我们许多党组织和政府的特色。我们党的宗旨是“全心全意为人民服务”。党从建立到壮大的进程，在某种意义上说，就是让群众感受和认识党的宗旨的过程。而党的事业受阻、工作出现失误的时候，往往就是我们离开或者违背了“为人民服务”的宗旨。可以说，为群众办实事，是我们党的优良传统，也是我们党的根本任务。无论什么时候，我们党都只能继承和发扬这个传统，不能淡化，更不能抛弃。
    为群众办实事，需要党和政府的干部时刻注意了解群众的呼声和情绪，实实在在地为他们排忧解难，给他们以好处。毛泽东同志说过，“我们的第一个方面的工作并不是向人民要东西，而是给人民以东西”，“只有在做了这一方面的工作，并确实生了成效之后，我们在做第二方面的工作——向人民要东西的工作时，我们才能取得人民的拥护”，“只有我们的同志懂得并实行这两个方面工作的配合时，我们方能算得上一个完全的共产主义的革命家”。
    回顾一下这几年我们的成绩与失误，都可以从群众情绪方面找出作风建设与思想建设上的经验与教训。遇到困难埋怨群众支持不够的同志，反躬自省，可能会发现自身存在官僚主义，对群众关心不够；至于那些不但不注意给群众以东西，而且老是向群众要东西，一会儿集资干这个，一会儿集资干那个的同志，受到群众埋怨和反对，则是理所当然的！
    为群众办实事，先要肯办。春夏秋冬，刮风下雨，房子、孩子、炉子，从基本的生活问题到其他方面的要求，实事到处有；民心朴素，他们所提的要求一般都不高，有些事办起来也不难。难的是树立自觉的、坚持不懈的“公仆”意识，自觉地办实事。只要我们的同志时刻不忘“全心全意为人民服务”的宗旨，一个问题一个问题地解决，一件事一件事地办，必然得到最广大的群众的支持和拥护。在这个前提下，即使有些事不能马上办或由于种种原因而办不到，向群众说明情况，也是可以得到谅解的。
    共产党人没有任何同整个无产阶级和人民群众的利益不同的利益。党的干部多为群众办实事并且不断提高办实事的水平，就能把群众“团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗”。从这个意义上说，群众最可爱，他们只要实实在在地感受到党和人民利益的一致性，就会矢志不移地跟党走：群众最可敬，他们的积极性一旦被调动起来，就会满腔热情地为党和政府“作劲”，许多难以度过的难关就会顺利过去；群众也最可怕，没有群众的理解和支持，几乎什么事情也办不成。
    为群众办实事，看上去似乎只是一个工作作风问题，实际上，它事关密切党群关系，是关系党的性质的大问题。每一个党的成员特别是党员干部都应时刻记住要“少说空话，多干实事”。
