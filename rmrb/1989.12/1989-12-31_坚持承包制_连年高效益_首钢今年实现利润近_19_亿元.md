To December 30, the Beijing Capital Iron and Steel Corporation (Shougang) has achieved a profit of 1.889 billion yuan this year, an increase of 17% over last year.

Shougang is one of the earliest large-scale enterprises in China to implement the contract system. Its profits have increased by 20% consecutively for ten years. Entering 1989, the company faced challenges such as energy and capital shortages, rising prices of raw materials and fuels, and the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the spring and summer. These factors added significant difficulties to Shougang's production and operations. Facing this severe situation, Shougang further improved the implementation of the contract system, breaking down various indicators to each position and individual. From the production line to the back-end services, from the workers to their families, everyone took action. Various units actively took on additional tasks, with one of Shougang's six subsidiaries, the Beijing Iron and Steel Company, having 19 units voluntarily increasing their tasks.

According to incomplete statistics, this year, the company's employees proposed more than 14,570 rationalization suggestions. After partial implementation, these suggestions generated 114.6 million yuan in benefits. The steelmaking system reduced iron consumption by more than 20 kilograms per ton of steel by increasing the use of scrap metal, equivalent to producing an additional 60,000 tons of steel. The rolling system focused on improving the qualification rate and yield, while also increasing product varieties, enhancing the market competitiveness of steel products. The company's total export earnings this year reached $56 million, which is 2.71 times that of last year.

    坚持承包制　连年高效益
    首钢今年实现利润近19亿元
    本报讯　到12月30日，首都钢铁公司今年实现利润已达到18.89亿元，比去年递增17％。
    首钢是我国最早实行承包制的大型企业，实现利润已经连续十年递增20％。进入1989年，能源、资金紧张，原、燃料涨价和春夏之交的动乱及反革命暴乱，给首钢的生产经营增加了很大难度。面对严峻形势，首钢进一步抓好承包制的修订和落实，把各项指标逐条分解到每个岗位和个人。从生产一线到后勤服务，从职工到家属都行动起来了。各单位纷纷算细帐、挖潜力，人人当家理财，全公司消化了5000万元的减利因素。首钢所属六大公司之一的北京钢铁公司，有19个单位主动给自己增加了任务。
    据不完全统计，今年以来全公司职工共提出合理化建议14570多条，经部分实施后，创效益1.146亿元。炼钢系统通过多吃废钢，使吨钢铁耗比去年降低了20多公斤，等于多炼钢6万多吨；轧钢系统在提高合格率、成材率上大作文章，同时增加了品种，增强了钢材的市场竞争能力。全公司今年各种产品出口创汇达5600万美元，相当于去年的2.71倍。
