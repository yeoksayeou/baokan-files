Public relations is increasingly valued both in the West and the East. In the United States, 8 out of the 25 hottest industries are related to public relations. The country has tens of thousands of public relations professionals, including over 20,000 public relations managers. More than 400 universities offer courses and majors in public relations, with some even providing master's and doctoral degrees in the field. Additionally, numerous public relations training and correspondence classes are available. Public relations associations have also been established. In the military, political, and business circles of Western countries, as well as in various government departments, public relations departments have been set up. In recent years, public relations has also become popular in some Eastern European countries.

The United Nations Development Programme is also concerned about the public relations activities of its member countries. With its support, China hosted an international conference on the development of public relations in Beijing earlier this year.

The key to developing the public relations industry is to improve the quality of public relations personnel. Sixty percent of public relations professionals in the United States have received higher education, and 40 percent are graduate students. It is often said that a qualified public relations professional must have the mind of an entrepreneur, the skills of a propagandist, and the demeanor of a diplomat.

    “公关”在国际上日益时兴
    余洋
    现在，不论西方，还是东方，都很重视公共关系。在美国最热门的25个行业中，与公共关系有关联的行业有8个。全国有公共关系人员十几万，其中公关经理就有2万多。400多所大学开设了公共关系课程和专业，有的还设立了公关硕士、博士学位课。社会上开办的各种公关训练班、函授班就更多了。此外，还建立了公关协会。在西方大国的军政界及工商界，甚至政府不少部门都设立了公共关系部。近年来，公共关系在东欧一些国家也日益流行起来。
  联合国开发署对于各成员国的公关活动也很关心，在它的支持下，由我国主办，于今年初在北京召开了发展公关的国际会议。
    发展公关事业的关键是提高公关人员的素质。美国公关人员中的60％受过高等教育，40％是研究生。有人形象地比喻说，一个合格的公关人员必须具备企业家的头脑，宣传家的技巧和外交家的风度。
