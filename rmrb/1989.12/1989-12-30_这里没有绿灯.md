	There Is No Green Light Here

	In our county's Kaicheng Town, approximately 1,400 people apply for marriage registration each year. Over the past few years, not a single case of marriage under the legal age has occurred. The reason is that the town's leaders and marriage registration staff strictly enforce the regulations. The former assistant of the town's civil affairs office, Wang Jiezhong, has been in charge of marriage registration for seven years, during which he has issued marriage certificates to over 4,800 couples, and not a single case of illegal marriage has occurred. Because this town has upheld the dignity of the Marriage Law, it has effectively controlled and prevented the phenomenon of early marriage and childbearing.

    这里没有绿灯
　　我县开通镇每年约有1400多人申请结婚登记。几年来，全镇没有发生一起不到法定婚龄而结婚的事。原因是这个镇的领导人和婚姻登记工作人员严格把关。镇原民政助理王洁忠负责婚姻登记工作7年之久，经他手领取结婚登记证的累计达4800多对，没有一对是违法结婚的。由于这个镇维护了婚姻法的尊严，结果有效地控制和防止了早婚早育现象。吉林通榆县广播站  傅铁铸
