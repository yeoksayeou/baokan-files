The first anti-cancer traditional Chinese medicine approved by the State Science and Technology Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine—Compound Tianxian Capsules—passed the acceptance review on November 10. This broad-spectrum anti-cancer traditional Chinese medicine compound has shown significant inhibitory effects on both animal and human cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, particularly on digestive system cancers such as esophageal and gastric cancers. It also reduces the blood and lymphatic metastasis of cancer cells and alleviates cancer pain. When used in conjunction with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, it can enhance the effectiveness of these treatments. Electron microscope observations have confirmed that preoperative administration of this drug can cause cancer cell necrosis and degeneration, significantly reducing the size of tumors.

Seventeen years ago, Wang Zhenguo, an individual with no formal education, based on the traditional Chinese medical theory of "expelling evil to restore health," combined with modern medical research on the anti-cancer effects of traditional Chinese herbs, formulated "Tianxian Pills" using more than 20 traditional Chinese herbs such as Tianhua Fen and Weilingxian. These pills were administered to patients with malignant tumors and showed good results. Experts took notice and, in early 1986, the Tianjin Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Beijing Guang'anmen Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine collaborated with him. Clinical efficacy observations were conducted on 189 cases of malignant tumors in 14 medical and research institutions nationwide, yielding positive results. That year, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine conducted a phase evaluation of the research results and formally listed them as a key scientific and technological research project for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Since then, the research has expanded to include 25 medical research institutions, both domestic and international, including the U.S. National Cancer Institute, with a total of over 800 clinical cases.

Compound Tianxian Capsules differ from general chemotherapy drugs. They possess the unique characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine, attacking evil without harming the body, and nourishing the body without aiding evil, attracting the attention of the international medical community. Since September 1988, when the Ministry of Health approved its production, over 30,000 cancer patients in 24 countries, including the United States, West Germany, and Japan, have used the capsules and achieved satisfactory results.

    抗癌中药走向世界
    ——“天仙胶囊”问世记
    本报记者　艾笑
    国家科委委托国家中医药管理局验收的第一个抗癌中成药——复方天仙胶囊11月10日通过了验收。这个抗癌谱较广的全中药复方制剂，对动物及人的体内和体外癌细胞都有明显的抑制作用，尤其对消化系统癌瘤，如食道癌、胃癌等作用更佳，还能减少癌细胞的血行和淋巴转移及癌性疼痛。服用它，配合放疗和化疗，可提高放疗、化疗效果。电镜观察已证实，手术前预服此药，可导致癌细胞坏死和变性，使癌肿明显变小。
    17年前，王振国这个没有学历的小人物，根据祖国医学“邪去正方安”的理论，结合近代医学对中草药抗癌作用的研究，用天花粉、威灵仙等20余味中草药配制了“天仙丸”，给恶性肿瘤患者服用，效果很好。专家们发现后十分重视，1986年初天津医药科学研究所和中医研究院北京广安门医院与其开展了民间合作，在全国14个医疗科研单位进行了189例恶性肿瘤临床疗效观察，给予肯定。当年国家科委、财政部、卫生部、国家中医药管理局就对其研究成果做出阶段性鉴定，并正式列为国家“七五”重点科技攻关课题。从此，这项研究扩大到包括美国国家肿瘤研究所在内的国内外25个医科研究单位，临床例数达800余。
    复方天仙胶囊与一般化疗的西药不同。它具有攻邪而不伤正，养正而不助邪的中医药特色，引起国际医药界的瞩目。自1988年9月我国卫生部批准生产后，美国、西德、日本等24个国家的3万多例癌症患者服用后，都获得了满意疗效。
