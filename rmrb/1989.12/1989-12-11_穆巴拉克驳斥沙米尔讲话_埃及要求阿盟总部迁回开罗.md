Mubarak Refutes Shamir's Speech
Egypt Demands Return of Arab League Headquarters to Cairo

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 9 - Egyptian President Mubarak today refuted Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's recent claim that a "Palestinian state already exists in Jordan."

Mubarak, upon returning to Cairo after his visit to Jordan, told reporters that Shamir's remarks indicated a retreat to the initial stage of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Mubarak said, "If that is the case, then the Arab side can also demand the entire Arab land, including Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip."

According to the Israeli newspaper "New News," Shamir said on the 8th that if he were a Palestinian, he would also hope to establish a Palestinian state.

He said, "Such a state already exists in Jordan."

Mubarak, when discussing his meeting with King Hussein of Jordan, said he is confident in the Arab-Israeli dialogue. He said, although the Palestinian side and Israel have reservations about the negotiations, negotiations are inevitable. Only through negotiations can both sides debate and understand each other, finding a way to solve the problem.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 9 - According to today's report by Egypt's "Al-Ahram," Egypt has submitted an application to the Arab League to move the Arab League headquarters back to Cairo from Tunis.

Cairo was once the location of the Arab League headquarters. However, after Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and was suspended from the Arab League, the headquarters was moved to Tunis.

Currently, except for Libya and Syria, all other Arab countries have restored diplomatic relations with Egypt. At the Casablanca Arab Summit in May this year, Egypt's membership in the Arab League was restored.

    穆巴拉克驳斥沙米尔讲话
    埃及要求阿盟总部迁回开罗
    新华社开罗12月9日电  埃及总统穆巴拉克今天驳斥以色列总理沙米尔日前所谓“巴勒斯坦国已存在于约旦国”的说法。
    穆巴拉克总统在结束对约旦访问后返回开罗时对记者说，沙米尔的讲话意味着退回到阿以冲突的最初阶段。
    穆巴拉克总统说，如果那样的话，那么阿拉伯方面也可以要求整个阿拉伯土地包括以色列、约旦河西岸和加沙地带。
    据以色列《新消息报》报道，沙米尔8日曾对该报说，如果他是一名巴勒斯坦人，他也会希望成立一个巴勒斯坦国。
    他说，“这样的国家已经在约旦存在。”
    穆巴拉克在谈到他与约旦国王侯赛因会晤的问题时说，他对巴以对话抱有信心。他说，虽然巴勒斯坦方面和以色列对谈判持有保留意见，但谈判势在必行，只有通过谈判双方才可能辩论和了解对方，找到解决问题的办法。
    新华社开罗12月9日电据埃及《金字塔报》今天报道，埃及已向阿拉伯联盟提出申请，要求将阿盟总部从突尼斯迁回开罗。
    开罗曾是阿盟总部的所在地。但在1979年因埃及同以色列签订和约而被中断阿盟成员国资格后，阿盟总部迁到了突尼斯。
    现在除利比亚和叙利亚外，所有其它阿拉伯国家都已同埃及恢复了外交关系。在今年5月的卡萨布兰卡阿拉伯特别首脑会议上，埃及被恢复了阿盟成员国资格。
