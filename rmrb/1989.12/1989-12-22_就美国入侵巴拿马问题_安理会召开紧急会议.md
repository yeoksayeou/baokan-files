The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting tonight at the UN headquarters to discuss the "situation following the U.S. invasion of Panama."

After the meeting began, Nicaragua's representative, Serrano Caldera, spoke first, condemning the U.S. military's invasion of Panama under the orders of U.S. President Bush as an act of hegemony. He stated that this action violated a series of treaties signed between the U.S. and Panama, as well as the UN Charter and international legal norms. It not only infringed upon the territorial integrity of a sovereign state but also seriously threatened peace and security in Latin America, particularly in Central America.

China's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Li Luye, also spoke at the meeting, expressing his shock and strong condemnation of the "U.S. brazenly sending troops to invade Panama and using force against a sovereign state."

Li Luye stated that the Chinese government has always advocated for resolving disputes between countries through negotiations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has always opposed interference in the internal affairs of other countries, especially through military means. He strongly urged and demanded that the "U.S. immediately stop this act of aggression, unconditionally withdraw all invading troops from Panama, respect Panama's independence and sovereignty, and engage in negotiations with Panama to resolve disputes peacefully, preventing the situation from escalating further, and contributing to peace, stability in the region, and world peace."

The Soviet representative, Belonogov, expressed "concern" over the news of the U.S. invasion of Panama. He pointed out that it was unreasonable for the U.S. to justify its military actions against another country as protecting American interests under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The Soviet Union could not remain indifferent to the challenge posed to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Now, the U.S. could no longer execute a policy of gunboat diplomacy or act as the world's police.

The U.S. representative, Pickering, defended the U.S.'s aggressive actions, claiming that the U.S. sent troops in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, exercising the "right to self-defense," to protect American lives, uphold the Panama Canal Treaty, defend democracy, and combat drug trafficking.

The British representative, Richardson, expressed "support for the actions taken by the U.S. against Panama." The Canadian representative, Fortier, and the French representative, Brown, in their speeches, on the one hand, disagreed with the U.S.'s use of military intervention, but on the other hand, also expressed understanding.

    就美国入侵巴拿马问题
    安理会召开紧急会议
    本报联合国12月20日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今晚在联合国大厦举行紧急会议，审议“美国入侵巴拿马后的形势”。
    会议开始后，尼加拉瓜代表塞拉诺·卡尔德拉首先发言，谴责美军根据美总统布什命令入侵巴拿马是强权政治，违反了美国与巴拿马签订的一系列条约，违反了联合国宪章和国际法准则，既侵犯了一个主权国家的领土完整，也严重威胁了拉丁美洲、特别是中美洲的和平与安全。
    中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野大使也在会上发言，对“美国悍然派兵入侵巴拿马，对一个主权国家使用武力”感到十分震惊，并表示强烈谴责。
    李鹿野表示，中国政府一贯主张国家间的争端应按照和平共处五项原则通过谈判来解决，一贯反对以任何借口，特别是使用军事手段干涉别国内政；并强烈呼吁和要求“美国立即停止这种侵略行动，无条件地从巴拿马撤回全部入侵军队，尊重巴拿马的独立和主权，同巴拿马进行谈判，用和平手段解决两国争端，防止事态进一步扩大，以利于该地区的和平、稳定与世界和平”。
    苏联代表别洛诺戈夫在发言中，对美国入侵巴拿马的消息表示“关切”。他指出，美国把对另一个国家的军事行动，说成是根据《联合国宪章》51条维护美国利益，是毫无道理的。苏联对国与国之间互不干涉原则受到挑战不能无动于衷。现在美国不能再执行炮舰政策和世界警察任务了。
    美国代表皮克林在发言中为美国的侵略行为辩解，说什么美国派兵是根据《联合国宪章》51条，行使“自卫权”，是保护美国人生命、维护巴拿马运河条约、捍卫民主、同贩毒作斗争的。
    英国代表理查森表示“支持美国对巴拿马所采取的行动”。加拿大代表福蒂埃和法国代表布朗在发言中一方面不同意美国武力干涉，另一方面又表示理解。
