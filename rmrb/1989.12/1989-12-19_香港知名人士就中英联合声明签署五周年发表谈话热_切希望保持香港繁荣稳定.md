Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 18th. Five years ago on December 19th, the Sino-British Joint Declaration was officially signed. On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Joint Declaration, reporters visited several prominent Hong Kong figures, some of whom were eyewitnesses to the historic event when they traveled to Beijing to attend the ceremony. These prominent figures expressed their fervent hope and confidence that China and Britain will faithfully implement the Joint Declaration to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference member and Hong Kong Legislative Council member Ho Shuk-choi believes that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a good agreement. From its signing until the beginning of this year, its implementation has been good. The June 4th incident in Beijing had some impact on Hong Kong, but if it weren't for a few individuals in Hong Kong who took advantage of the situation to stir up trouble for personal gain, things would not have escalated. Looking back now, it is particularly important to view the situation in mainland China through the principle of "one country, two systems." He hopes that both China and Britain will strictly adhere to the various provisions of the Joint Declaration and continue to cooperate amicably. The Chinese side should draft a good Basic Law; the British side should not allow anyone in Hong Kong to use various excuses to disrupt Hong Kong, and should also consult with the Chinese government to resolve issues related to Hong Kong. This is a matter between China and Britain and has nothing to do with other countries.

Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions Vice Chairman and Legislative Council member Tam Yiu-chung believes that the signing of the Joint Declaration benefits both China and Britain, as well as Hong Kong. It is a realistic and far-sighted solution to the Hong Kong issue. The Joint Declaration has stood the test of time. Although there have been differing views between China and Britain on some issues recently, the leaders of both sides have expressed their commitment to continuing the implementation of the Joint Declaration.

Basic Law Drafting Committee member Lee Fuk-shan, who was present at the signing ceremony of the Sino-British Joint Declaration five years ago, believes that the Joint Declaration is a document that preserves the existing advantages of Hong Kong, ensuring its prosperity and stability, rather than a document advocating for drastic reforms. Except for changing Hong Kong's colonial status, other aspects should not be changed too quickly. The Basic Law should also reflect this spirit of the Joint Declaration, maintaining the existing political, economic, legal, and other social systems of Hong Kong. He believes that the silent majority in Hong Kong, who have not been able to express their views through the media, hope for a stable life and for Hong Kong to maintain its existing advantages. He believes that the progress of the Basic Law drafting work over the past few years has been satisfactory, and that most of the provisions in the current draft of the Basic Law are also satisfactory.

Lau Yiu-chu, a National People's Congress representative from the Hong Kong region and a member of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, who attended the signing ceremony of the Sino-British Joint Declaration five years ago as an ordinary Hong Kong resident, was very excited when discussing this historic agreement. She believes that Hong Kong is an international trade and financial center, and that the economic interests of foreigners in Hong Kong should be guaranteed, so that foreigners will believe that their economic interests are protected when they come to Hong Kong to do business or lend money. Only in this way can Hong Kong maintain its prosperity and stability and achieve a smooth transfer of power.

She said, "I am a National People's Congress representative from the Hong Kong region, living in Hong Kong but with my heart towards the entire country. We overseas Chinese sometimes do not fully understand the situation in mainland China, and when we care about the affairs of mainland China, we sometimes act emotionally." She hopes that there will be more communication and mutual understanding between mainland China and Hong Kong.

Basic Law Consultative Committee member Sim Fook-yee attended the signing ceremony of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He said that after the signing of the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong's real estate market became active, the stock market rebounded, and social confidence quickly recovered. He pointed out that whether it is before or after 1997, Hong Kong cannot maintain its prosperity without a stable environment.

    香港知名人士就中英联合声明签署五周年发表谈话热
    切希望保持香港繁荣稳定
    新华社香港12月18日电5年前的12月19日，是中英联合声明正式签字的日子。在中英联合声明签署5周年的前夕，记者走访了多位香港人士，其中几位是当年曾专程赴京观礼，亲眼目睹这个历史事件的见证人。这些知名人士向记者表达了对中英两国切实贯彻联合声明，保持香港繁荣稳定的热切愿望和信心。
    全国政协委员、香港立法局议员何世柱认为，中英联合声明是一个好的协议，自签署到今年初，执行情况也是良好的。6月间的北京风波对香港有一定影响，但要不是香港有极少数人为达到个人目的而乘机生事，事情也不至于闹大。现在回顾起来，用“一国两制”的原则来看待内地的事情，显得特别重要。他希望，中英两国都能严格履行联合声明的各项内容，继续友好合作。中国方面要制订出一部好的基本法；英国方面则不能容许香港有人利用这样或那样的理由搞乱香港，同时，解决有关香港的问题要与中国政府协商。这是中英两国的事，与别的国家无关。
    香港工会联合会副理事长、立法局议员谭耀宗认为，签订联合声明对中英两国和香港都有益，这是解决香港问题的现实而又有远见的办法。事实证明，中英联合声明经得起时间的考验。尽管近期内，中英双方对一些问题有不同看法，但双方领导人都表示要继续执行联合声明。
    香港基本法起草委员李福善5年前曾亲临现场参加《中英联合声明》签字仪式观礼。他认为，联合声明是一篇保存的文章，要保存香港现有的优点，保持香港的繁荣稳定，而不是一篇大肆改革的文章，除了改变香港的殖民地性质外，其它的不能一下变更太快。基本法也应体现出联合声明中的这一精神，尽量保持香港现有的政治、经济、法律等各项社会生活制度的优点。他相信，现在香港那些未能通过舆论工具宣传自己观点的沉默的大多数人希望安居乐业，希望香港能保持现有的优点。他认为，几年来基本法起草工作进程令人满意，现在的基本法草案的绝大部分条文也是令人满意的。
    5年前以香港普通居民身份赴京观礼的全国人大代表、香港基本法起草委员廖瑶珠在谈及这一具有历史意义的协议时显得很兴奋。她认为，香港是一个国际贸易和金融中心，应保障外国在香港的经济利益，使外国人相信来香港做生意、贷款时，经济利益是有保障的。这样，香港才能保持繁荣稳定，实现政权的顺利过渡。
    她说，“我是香港地区的全国人大代表，住在香港，心却向着全国。我们海外人士对内地有些情况不太了解，在关心内地的事情时，有时容易感情用事。”她希望，内地与香港能增加沟通，增加相互了解。
    香港基本法咨询委员会委员简福饴参加了中英联合声明签字仪式观礼。他说，联合声明签署后，香港的房地产市道活跃，股票市场回升，社会信心也迅速恢复。他指出，不论是“九七”前还是“九七”后的香港，如果没有一个安定的环境，就不可能保持繁荣。
