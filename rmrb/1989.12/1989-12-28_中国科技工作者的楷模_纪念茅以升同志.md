On November 12, 1989, Comrade Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the 6th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Honorary Chairman of the Zhi San Society, Honorary Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, renowned bridge engineering expert, and aged 94, passed away. The news of his demise filled me with profound sorrow. Comrade Mao was one of the elders I have always respected. His lifelong achievements in scientific and technological work and his noble character are worthy of our eternal remembrance and learning.

Mao Yisheng was born on January 9, 1896, in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. As a youth, Mao Yisheng witnessed the poverty and backwardness of old China and resolved to strive for strength through science and technology to revitalize the nation. In 1916, he graduated from Tangshan Industrial School and went to the United States to study. In 1920, he obtained a Ph.D. in Engineering from Carnegie Institute of Technology and immediately returned to China. From then on, he dedicated his life to the cause of science and technology in his motherland.

As a bridge engineering expert, Mao Yisheng saw that the construction rights of many railway bridges, such as the Jinan Yellow River Bridge and the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge, were controlled by imperialists, which deeply pained him. He was determined to make a name for China in the field of bridge engineering. In August 1933, Mao Yisheng took on the task of constructing the Qianjiang Bridge and served as the director of the engineering office. At that time, relevant parties asked Mao Yisheng and an American bridge expert to each design a plan. After comparison, Mao Yisheng's plan was both superior and more economical, and was quickly approved. However, the Qianjiang River is vast, with surging tides and a riverbed covered by 41 meters of quicksand. Building a bridge over such a river was no easy task! Some foreign engineers said, "They have no experience or ability to build such a large bridge!" "It will definitely fail!" But these mocking remarks did not shake Mao Yisheng's resolve to build a bridge for his country. After careful investigation and research, he creatively adopted the "water jet method" to overcome the difficulty of driving piles in the thick, hard layer of quicksand; adopted the "caisson method" to overcome the difficulty of construction in fast-flowing water; and used the "floating method" to skillfully install steel beams on the bridge piers using the rise and fall of the tides. During the construction of the bridge, he overcame more than 80 major problems. In just two and a half years, he built a 1,453-meter-long, 71-meter-high dual-purpose railway and road bridge across the turbulent Qianjiang River. This was the first modern bridge designed and built by the Chinese, a landmark event in the history of Chinese bridge construction. It demonstrated the wisdom and ability of Chinese scientific and technological workers and the ability of the Chinese people to stand among the nations of the world, a monument that will never fade!

After liberation, Mao Yisheng also participated in the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. As the chairman of the technical advisory committee for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, he devoted his heart and soul to the construction of the bridge.

Mao Yisheng made multifaceted contributions to China's scientific and technological cause: he led the country's railway scientific research for over 30 years, dedicating his hard work; he devoted himself to the study of bridge history, edited "A History of Ancient Chinese Bridge Technology," and won the China Book Honor Award; he explored some macro issues in science and technology, writing dozens of papers. In recent years, he has actively advocated for the development of continuing education and volunteered to serve as the president of the Beijing Science and Technology Continuing Education Institute, contributing his strength to meet the challenges of the new technological revolution.

Mao Yisheng, although a renowned scientific and technological expert at home and abroad, attached great importance to science popularization. He believed that "science belongs to the people" and "science popularization is a bridge to the Four Modernizations." For this reason, in addition to his busy scientific and technological work and social activities, he spared no effort in science popularization, writing a large number of science popularization works. He wrote science popularization books such as "Qianjiang Bridge," "Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge," and "Selected Works of Mao Yisheng on Science Popularization," and hundreds of science popularization articles. His "Bridge Talk" was praised by Chairman Mao, "Chinese Stone Arch Bridges" was selected into the middle school language textbook, and "There is No Bridge That Cannot Be Built" won the first prize for excellent science popularization works in the new Long March in 1980. He often went to the masses and young people to give science popularization lectures, which were well received. He not only built bridges over rivers for the motherland but also built bridges of knowledge between science and the people.

Comrade Mao Yisheng was not only an outstanding scientist but also an educator who was tireless in teaching others. He had successively served as a professor at Tangshan Transportation University, Dean and Professor of the Engineering College of Southeast University in Nanjing, President and Professor of Hehai Engineering College, President and Professor of Tianjin Beiyang Engineering College, and President of Beijing China Transportation University, cultivating a large number of scientific and technological talents for the motherland, which can be described as having students all over the world. In teaching, he emphasized inspiration and opposed indoctrination, making many innovative explorations. For example, he once advocated that not only should teachers test students, but students should also test teachers, grading them based on the level of questions asked by students, which was not only beneficial for students to think and solve problems independently and creatively but also achieved the effect of mutual learning. Famous educator Tao Xingzhi said, "This is indeed a new revolution in teaching." Comrade Mao Yisheng attached great importance to the combination of theory and practice, and wrote many articles to discuss this. He once turned the Qianjiang Bridge construction site into a bridge engineering technology school, allowing relevant colleges and universities to send students in batches to participate in the bridge construction and give lectures based on actual conditions. Many chief engineers and engineering technicians who participated in the construction of large bridges in China after liberation had received the enlightenment of Mao Yisheng's "Bridge School" on the Qianjiang River.

Comrade Mao Yisheng's great achievements in the field of science and technology have won him wide recognition at home and abroad. Before liberation, he was elected as the president of the Chinese Engineering Society and an academician of the Central Research Institute. After liberation, he was elected as a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, president of the Chinese Society of Civil Engineering, vice president of the China Association for Science and Technology, and vice president of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology. Internationally, he was elected as a member of the International Bridge and Structural Engineering Society, a member of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, an honorary member of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering, and an academician of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (he was the first Chinese to receive this title). To commend his outstanding contributions to the cause of science and technology, the Chinese Engineering Society awarded him the honorary medal, Cornell University in the United States awarded him the "Fulbright" research medal, and Carnegie Mellon University in the United States awarded him the "Distinguished Alumni" medal.

Comrade Mao Yisheng's life was one of unremitting struggle for the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of the people. He advanced with the times, making his patriotism shine with new luster. Once he realized that only the Communist Party could make the country prosperous and the people happy, he resolutely followed the Communist Party of China, dedicating his entire life to the great cause of socialism.

In his youth, Comrade Mao Yisheng was a loyal patriot. After returning from studying in the United States, he presided over the administration of many universities and often sympathized with, supported, and helped the patriotic student movement. As a scientist, he hoped to save the country and the people through science and technology and revitalize the nation. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in old China, this good wish could only be a fantasy. He later recalled his ideological journey, saying: "In the first half of my life, I prided myself on being 'non-partisan' and 'above politics,' a consistent advocate of 'scientific salvation' and 'engineering salvation,' a democrat. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I witnessed the Kuomintang reactionaries launching a civil war, destroying democracy, and relying on imperialism, and began to realize that only the Communist Party leading the masses to revolution could save China." From then on, he devoted himself to the cause of the people's revolution led by the Party and advanced unremittingly.

The historic changes in China finally made Mao Yisheng realize: "The Communist Party of China is the chief engineer of building a new China." In the decades since the founding of New China, he has always followed the Party's lead, practicing his beliefs with his actions. This is not only reflected in scientific and technological work but also in political life and social activities.

In 1949, Mao Yisheng attended the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Since then, he has served as a member of the 2nd to 6th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a representative of the 1st to 6th National People's Congress. He strived to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to study and develop socialist science and technology and education, and put forward many valuable opinions and suggestions to the Party and the government. He pointed out that science and technology and production are a dialectical relationship of mutual promotion, advocating the combination of science and technology with practice; he proposed that education should be combined with production and practice, advocating the development of various forms of education. In 1962, he submitted the "Proposal to Build an Educational System Serving Socialism" to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, systematically expounding his suggestions for educational system reform, which was praised by Premier Zhou Enlai. Comrade Mao Yisheng's opinions and suggestions, which shine with socialist ideology, have been valued by the Party and the government and have had a positive impact on China's science and technology and education.

Comrade Mao Yisheng actively devoted himself to the cause of the Party's patriotic united front. In 1952, he joined the Zhi San Society and served as the vice chairman of the Zhi San Society Central Committee for a long time. Over the years, he used his influence to connect and promote the participation of people at home and abroad in the socialist construction of the motherland and the promotion of national reunification, making indelible contributions.

He had led Chinese science and technology delegations to visit many countries, introducing the construction achievements of socialist New China to the people of the world, and working hard to promote the exchange of science and technology and culture between China and foreign countries and the friendship between the peoples of various countries. He had widely contacted overseas Chinese scientists and technicians, enthusiastically introducing the policies of the Communist Party of China and the achievements of the socialist motherland to them, encouraging them to actively contribute to the construction of the motherland. On the eve of the National Day in 1981, the Communist Party of China issued a call for national reunification to the authorities in Taiwan, which greatly inspired Mao Yisheng. He believed that before the "bridge" of peaceful reunification officially started construction, scientists and technicians on both sides of the strait could each build a "ramp." For this reason, he proposed a series of suggestions for academic exchanges and mutual visits between scientists and technicians on both sides of the strait. The article "Mao Yisheng Designing the 'Ramp'" published in the People's Daily on December 10, 1981, reported on this, which had a good influence at home and abroad.

As early as the 1950s, Comrade Mao Yisheng had raised the issue of socialist spiritual civilization construction, stressing that "science serves the people" and attaching great importance to the ideological and moral cultivation of scientific and technological workers. He practiced what he preached, actively participating in political study organized by the Zhi San Society and other aspects, consciously using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide his thoughts and actions; he insisted on the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, was strict in scholarship, good at independent thinking, and daring to innovate; he was modest and prudent, approachable, strict with himself, and tolerant of others; he worked hard for decades, dedicating his heart and soul to the cause of science and technology and education in the motherland, never calculating personal gains and losses. This earned him the sincere respect and admiration of the broad masses of intellectuals. To unite and influence the broad masses of intellectuals to serve the cause of socialism under the leadership of the Party, he did a lot of work. He had published more than 30 articles and speeches, combining his personal experience to discuss how intellectuals should learn Marxism-Leninism, accept the leadership of the Communist Party, adhere to the socialist road, and constantly strengthen ideological construction, which had a positive impact on intellectuals. In May 1982, at his initiative, more than 100 scientists in the capital signed and formulated the "Scientific Ethics Norms for Scientific Work in the Capital," which was published in the People's Daily and received a warm response from the broad masses of scientific and technological workers in the capital.

Comrade Mao Yisheng had long harbored the wish to join the Communist Party of China. However, to better serve the Party, he remembered Premier Zhou's words and always kept this beautiful wish in his heart, and strictly required himself with the standards of a Communist Party member. In his later years, considering his physical condition, he finally proposed to join the Party and became an honorable member of the Communist Party in 1987, realizing his long-cherished wish.

Comrade Mao Yisheng has left us. He spent his life building bridges over rivers for the motherland, building bridges of knowledge between science and the people, building bridges between the Party and intellectuals, and also building a bridge of life from patriot to communist. His brilliant achievements will forever be in the hearts of the people, and his lofty image will forever be a model for Chinese scientific and technological workers.

    中国科技工作者的楷模
    ——纪念茅以升同志
    周培源
    1989年11月12日，第六届全国政协副主席、九三学社中央名誉主席、中国科协名誉主席、著名桥梁工程专家、94岁高龄的茅以升同志与世长辞了。噩耗传来，我心中的悲痛难以言表。茅老是我素来最尊重的老友之一。他一生在科技工作上的业绩和高尚的品德，值得我们永远纪念和学习。
    一
    茅以升1896年1月9日出生于江苏镇江。少年时代的茅以升，目睹旧中国贫穷落后的面貌，决心发愤图强，以科学技术振兴国家。他1916年于唐山工业专门学校毕业后赴美国留学，1920年获美国卡内基理工学院工学博士学位后旋即回国。从那以后，他为祖国的科技事业无私奉献了一生。
    作为一名桥梁工程专家，茅以升看到济南黄河大桥、郑州黄河大桥等许多铁路桥梁的修建权都被帝国主义把持，深感痛心，决心要在桥梁事业上为中国人争气。1933年8月，茅以升承接了建造钱塘江大桥的任务，担任工程处处长。当时有关方面请茅以升和美国桥梁专家各设计一个方案，两相比较，茅以升的方案既好又省，很快得到了批准。但是，钱塘江江面辽阔，江潮浩荡，江底覆盖着厚达41米的流沙，要在江上建造大桥，谈何容易！一些外国工程师说：“他们没有建这样大桥的经验和本领！”“一定要失败的！”但这些冷嘲热讽丝毫没有动摇茅以升要为祖国建造大桥的决心。经过认真的调查研究，他创造性地采用了“射水法”，克服了在厚硬的流沙层上难以打桩的困难；采用“沉箱法”，克服了水流湍急难以施工的困难；采用“浮运法”，利用江潮的涨落巧妙地在桥墩上架设了钢梁。在建桥过程中，他克服了80多个重大难题，仅用了两年半的时间，就在激流汹涌的钱塘江上建起了这座长1453米、高71米的铁路公路两用双层大桥。这是中国人自己设计和建造的第一座现代化的大桥，是中国桥梁建筑史上一件划时代的大事。它显示了中国科技工作者的聪明才智，显示了中国人民有自立于世界民族之林的能力，是一座不朽的丰碑！
    解放以后，茅以升又参加了建造武汉长江大桥的工作。他作为武汉长江大桥技术顾问委员会主任，为建好大桥耗尽了心血。
    茅以升对我国科技事业的贡献是多方面的：他主持我国铁道科学研究30多年，付出了辛勤的劳动；他致力于桥梁史的研究，主编了《中国古代桥梁技术史》，荣获中华图书荣誉奖；他曾对科学技术中的一些宏观问题进行研究探索，写下了数十篇论文。近年来，他又积极倡导发展继续教育，并自告奋勇兼任北京市科技进修学院院长，为迎接世界新技术革命挑战贡献自己的力量。
    二
    茅以升同志虽然是中外闻名的科技专家，但却非常重视科普工作。他认为“科学属于人民”，
  “科普是一座通向四化的桥梁”。为此，他在紧张繁忙的科技工作和社会活动之外，不遗余力地从事科普活动，写下了大量的科普著作。他曾撰写了《钱塘江桥》、《武汉长江大桥》、《茅以升科普创作选集》等科普书籍和数百篇科普文章。他写的《桥话》受到毛主席的称赞，《中国石拱桥》一文被选入中学语文教材，《没有不能造的桥》一文荣获1980年新长征优秀科普作品一等奖。他经常到群众和青少年中去做科普演讲，深受欢迎。他不仅为祖国江河架桥，而且为科技与人民之间架设了一座座知识的桥梁。
    茅以升同志不仅是一位杰出的科学家，而且是
  一位诲人不倦的教育家。他曾先后担任过唐山交通大学教授，南京东南大学工科主任、教授，河海工科大学校长、教授，天津北洋工学院院长、教授，北京中国交通大学校长等职，为祖国培养了一批批科技人才，可谓桃李满天下。他在教学上注重启发，反对灌输，做过许多革新探索。例如他曾主张不但老师考学生而且学生也要考老师，根据学生所提问题水平的高低打分，不仅对学生独立地、创造性地思考和解决问题大有益处，而且收到了教学相长的效果。著名教育家陶行知先生说：“这的确是个崭新的教学上的革命。”茅以升同志十分重视理论与实践相结合，并为此写过许多文章加以论述。他曾把钱塘江大桥工地当作一所桥梁工程技术学校，让有关大、中专学校分批派学生来参加建桥工作，并结合实际给他们讲课。在我国解放以后参加兴建巨大桥梁工程的许多总工程师和工程技术人员，都曾受到过茅以升钱塘江“桥梁学校”的陶冶。
    茅以升同志在科技事业上的巨大成就使他在国内外赢得了广泛的荣誉。解放前他曾经被选为中国工程学会会长、中央研究院院士。解放后他被选为中国科学院学部委员，中国土木工程学会理事长，中华全国科学技术普及协会副主席，中国科协副主席；在国际上，他被选为国际桥梁及结构工程学会会员，国际土力学及基础工程学会会员，加拿大土木工程学会名誉会员，美国国家工程科学院院士
  （他是第一位获得这一称号的中国人）。为表彰他对科技事业的杰出贡献，中国工程师学会曾授予他荣誉奖章，美国康奈尔大学曾授予他“福帝士”研究奖章，美国卡内基——梅隆大学曾授予他“卓越校友”奖章。
    三
    茅以升同志的一生是为祖国富强和人民幸福奋斗不息的一生。他伴随着时代的步伐前进，使自己的爱国主义精神不断放射出新的光彩。当他一旦认清只有共产党才能使国家富强、人民幸福的时候，就义无返顾地追随中国共产党，把自己的全部生命贡献给社会主义的伟大事业。
    青年时代的茅以升同志是个忠诚的爱国主义者。他从美国留学回国之后，在许多高等学校主持校务的时候，曾多次对爱国学生运动给予同情、支持和帮助。作为一名科学家，他一心希望通过科学技术救国救民，振兴国家。然而在国民党反动派统治的旧中国，他的这一良好愿望只能是一种幻想。他后来在回忆自己的思想历程时说：“我的前半生，自诩‘无党派’、‘超政治’，是一个一贯崇尚‘科学救国’、‘工程救国’的民主主义者。抗日战争胜利后，我目睹国民党反动派发动内战，摧残民主，投靠帝国主义，开始认识到只有共产党领导人民大众起来革命，才能救中国。”从那以后，他投身于党所领导的人民革命事业不断前进，矢志不渝。
    中国发生的历史性变革使茅以升终于认定：
  “中国共产党是建设新中国的总工程师。”新中国成立以后的几十年中，他始终坚定不移地跟党走，用自己的行动实践着自己的信念。这不仅表现在科技工作上，更表现在政治生活和社会活动上。
    1949年茅以升出席了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议。此后一直担任全国政协二至六届委员，全国人大一至六届代表。他努力运用马列主义、毛泽东思想研究发展社会主义科技和教育事业问题，向党和政府提出了许多颇有价值的意见和建议。他指出科技与生产是相互促进的辩证关系，倡导科技与实际相结合；他提出教育要与生产、实践相结合，提倡发展多种形式的教育。1962年，他向全国人大常委会提出了《建设一个为社会主义服务的教育制度》的建议，系统地阐述了他对教育制度改革的建议，受到周恩来总理的赞扬。茅以升同志这些闪烁着社会主义思想光彩的意见和建议受到党和政府的重视，对我国科技和教育事业产生了积极影响。
    四
    茅以升同志积极致力于党的爱国统一战线事业。他于1952年参加九三学社，并于1958年起长期担任九三学社中央副主席职务。几十年来，他运用自己的影响，在联系和推动海内外人士积极参加祖国的社会主义建设、促进祖国和平统一等方面，做出了不可磨灭的贡献。
    他曾多次率领中国科技代表团出国，向世界人民介绍社会主义新中国的建设成就，为促进中外科技文化的交流和各国人民的友谊辛劳奔波。他曾广泛联系海外华人中的科技工作者，热心向他们介绍中国共产党的政策和社会主义祖国的成就，鼓励他们积极为祖国的建设贡献力量。1981年国庆节前夕，中国共产党向台湾当局发出了祖国和平统一的号召，茅以升很受鼓舞。他认为这座和平统一的“大桥”正式动工之前，海峡两岸的科技工作者可以各修一座“引桥”。为此，他提出了海峡两岸的科技工作者进行学术交流和互访的一系列建议，1981年12月10日《人民日报》刊登的《茅以升在设计“引桥”》一文对此进行了报道，在海内外产生了良好影响。
    早在50年代，茅以升同志就提出了社会主义精神文明建设问题，强调“科学是为人民服务的”，十分重视科技工作者的思想道德修养。他身体力行，积极参加九三学社及其他方面组织的政治学习，自觉用马列主义、毛泽东思想指导自己的思想和行动；他坚持实事求是的科学精神，治学严谨，善于独立思考，勇于开拓创新；他谦虚谨慎，平易近人，严于律己，宽以待人；他数十年如一日艰苦奋斗，呕心沥血地为祖国的科技教育事业辛勤耕耘，从不计较个人得失。这使他赢得了广大知识分子的衷心敬佩和爱戴。为了团结和影响广大知识分子在党的领导下为社会主义事业服务，他做了许多工作。他曾发表过30多篇文章、讲话，结合切身经历，论述知识分子要学习马列主义，接受共产党领导，坚持社会主义道路，不断加强思想建设，在知识分子中产生了积极影响。1982年5月，在他的倡议下，首都100多名科学家签名制定了《首都科技工作科学道德规范》，在《人民日报》上发表，得到首都广大科技界人士的热烈响应。
    茅以升同志很早就产生了加入中国共产党的愿望。但是为了更好地为党做工作，他牢记周总理的话，始终把这一美好愿望埋在心里，并以共产党员的标准严格要求自己。晚年，他考虑到自己的身体状况，终于提出了入党要求，并于1987年成为一名光荣的共产党员，实现了自己数十年来的宿愿。
    茅以升同志离我们而去了。他一生为祖国江河架桥，为科技与人民架桥，为党和知识分子架桥，也为自己架设了一座由爱国主义者通向共产主义者的人生之桥。他的光辉业绩将永远留在人民的心里，他的崇高形象将永远是中国科技工作者的楷模。
