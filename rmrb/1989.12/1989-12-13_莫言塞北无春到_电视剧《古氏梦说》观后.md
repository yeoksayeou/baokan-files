Idealism and romanticism are inseparable. “A youth’s aspirations should be as boundless as the clouds,” idealism can give people wings to soar through the heavens. Mr. Mao Dun believed that there is reason to classify romantic literature as the “idealist school.” The Inner Mongolia Television Station’s six-episode television series *Ancient Dreams* (directed by Ma Xiaogang), although based on realistic themes, has a deep undercurrent of romantic spirit, which perhaps is the symbolic meaning of the title “dreams.”

When people demand too much from nature, humanity is bound to suffer the retribution of an overburdened nature. Recognizing this crisis and taking action to secure a better tomorrow for humanity should be the mark of a qualified modern person. *Ancient Dreams* depicts a new generation, represented by Gu Zhi Yuan, who begin to demand a change from the traditional model of merely taking from nature, striving to protect the environment and build a harmonious relationship between humans and nature. However, old habits and ideas permeate every corner of life, making their progress difficult. This television series reveals the real situation faced by a group of idealists. This realism is particularly evident in the series. Gu Zhi Yuan is not only engaged in environmental protection but is also challenging the established way of life. The setbacks in his career and the failure of his love life almost destroy him. It is the adversity that sharpens his idealistic sword, making it sparkle.

The film uses thick, bold strokes to depict the atmosphere and express emotions. Although the scenes captured are strongly realistic, due to the careful arrangement of the shots, they have a distinct subjective color and a strong lyrical tone. Xiaoxiu, the young girl, is a victim of the old interpersonal and human-nature relationship model. The screen repeatedly flashes close-ups of her vibrant life and withered state, enhancing the tragic power. The rural landscapes, cityscapes, and the frequent appearance of close-ups of withered branches create a poetic interest and also embody a complex social meaning. However, some parts of the script deviate too much from the main theme, making the entire film seem redundant. This television series is shot in a simple and straightforward manner, without any flashy elements; however, on the other hand, the pacing of the entire series lacks the necessary rhythm and climax, which is somewhat regrettable.

    莫言塞北无春到
    ——电视剧《古氏梦说》观后
    高鉴
    理想和浪漫有着不解之缘。“少年心事当拿云”，理想，能给人插上乘风振奋出六合的大翼。茅盾先生认为，有理由把浪漫主义文学划成“理想派”。内蒙古电视台摄制的六集电视连续剧《古氏梦说》
  （导演马小钢）虽然写的是现实题材，但作品的深层却涌动着一股浪漫精神的潜流，这或许就是片名“梦说”的象征涵意。
    当人们向大自然索取的太多、太贪婪时，人类势必遭受不堪重负的大自然的惩罚。意识到这种危机，并为人类争取美好的明天而行动，这应该是一个合格的现代人的标志。《古氏梦说》描绘了以古致远为代表的新一代人，开始要求改变一味向自然索取的传统模式，力图保护环境，建设一种人与自然的和谐关系。然而，旧的习惯、观念渗透在生活的每个角落，因此他们举步维艰。这部电视剧向我们揭示的便是一批理想主义者面对的现实处境。这种现实性尤其表现在剧中。古致远不仅是在搞环境保护事业，更重要的是在向人们习惯了的生活方式展开了挑战。事业的挫折、爱情的失败，几乎摧毁他。正是逆境的砺石，磨得他的理想之剑迸出火花。
    该片以浓墨重彩点染氛围，抒情言志。虽然镜头采撷的都是具有强烈现实感的画面，但由于注重镜头的组接，因而具有鲜明的主观色彩和浓重的抒情格调。小秀姑娘是旧的人际关系和人与自然关系模式的牺牲品，屏幕上大篇幅地反复闪现她生命的绚丽和枯萎的对比特写，强化了悲剧力量。而乡野景色、城市风光和不断出现的枯枝特写的对接，既产生了一种诗化的旨趣，也体现了某种复杂的社会涵义。不过，有些笔墨离题旨远了些，而使全片有冗赘之嫌。这部电视剧拍得朴实、简洁，没有浮华之笔；但在另一方面，全剧的节奏缺乏必要的张弛与高潮，似为一点缺憾。
