Brazil Election Results: Collor Elected President

Our reporter Lan Cái Jī reports from Brasília, December 19th: The results of Brazil's second-round election have been announced today. The presidential candidate of the Party of National Reconstruction, Fernando Collor de Mello, has been elected as the next president of Brazil.

According to the official vote count released by the Brazilian Supreme Electoral Court this evening, the presidential candidate of the Party of National Reconstruction, Collor, received over 33.93 million votes, accounting for 42.72%. His sole opponent, the presidential candidate of the Workers' Party, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, received over 30.55 million votes, accounting for 38.46%, a difference of over 3.3 million votes. There were also over 14.95 million invalid, blank, and abstained votes. Therefore, Collor has been elected as the president.

Brazil's election began on November 15th. In the first round of direct popular voting, none of the 21 presidential candidates received more than half of the votes, necessitating a second round of voting to determine the new president from the top two candidates. According to the Brazilian Constitution, each presidential term is five years, with no possibility of re-election. The current president, José Sarney, will hand over power to the newly elected president on March 15th of next year, who will then reorganize the cabinet leadership. Currently, many political figures have suggested that the new and old presidents should expedite the transfer of power to facilitate the implementation of new policies and measures to address the country's current economic difficulties. In response, Sarney has publicly stated, "If Congress can pass this resolution, I will not set any obstacles."

    巴西大选揭晓　科洛尔当选总统
    本报巴西利亚12月19日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西第二轮大选今天已经揭晓，国家复兴党总统候选人费尔南多·科洛尔·德梅洛当选为下任巴西总统。
    据巴西最高选举法院今晚正式公布的开票统计数字，国家复兴党总统候选人科洛尔得票为3393万多张，占42.72％，他的唯一竞选对手劳工党总统候选人卢拉得票3055万多张，占38.46％，相差330多万张，另有废票、白票和弃权票1495万多张，因此科洛尔已经当选为总统。
    巴西这次大选是在11月15日开始举行的，在第一轮的全民直接投票选举中，21名总统候选人得票均未超过半数，因此必须举行第二轮投票，从得票最多的前两名候选人中产生新总统。按照巴西宪法规定，每届总统任期5年，不得连任。本届总统萨尔内将于明年3月15日向新当选总统移交权力，由新总统重新组织内阁领导班子。当前已有不少政界人士建议新旧总统提前交接政权，便于推行新的政策措施，摆脱国家当前所面临的经济困难。对此，萨尔内已公开表示，“如果国会能通过此项决议，本人将不设置任何障碍”。
