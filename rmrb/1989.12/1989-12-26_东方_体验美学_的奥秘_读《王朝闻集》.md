The sixteen-volume series "The Collected Works of Wang Chaowen," totaling approximately seven million words, has been published by Sichuan Fine Arts Publishing House. This collection includes all of Wang Chaowen's published and unpublished theoretical works, organized by the date of writing and publication sequence for the published works, and by the date of writing for the unpublished works, which are included as appendices in the corresponding volumes.

People often jokingly refer to Wang Chaowen as a "giant" and say he is a "versatile artist" and a "jack-of-all-trades" who doesn't stick to one profession. This reflects his profound and extensive knowledge. It is not difficult to see that he is skilled at understanding Mao Zedong's military dialectics and cleverly applying them to artistic dialectics, as seen in his works such as "One for Ten." He admires Zhou Enlai's ability to handle domestic and foreign affairs with composure and uses this flexibility to resolve contradictions in art, as seen in "On Artistic Techniques." He also successfully applies the guerrilla warfare and protracted struggle tactics advocated by Lu Xun to engage in a tenacious battle against metaphysics, as seen in his writing of "On Xifeng." He inherits the spirit of progress, complementarity, and harmony from Confucianism, as seen in "Further Exploration"; he draws on the spirit of tranquility, naturalness, and transcendence from Taoism; and he gains inspiration, enlightenment, and intuition from Buddhism, as seen in "Aesthetic Sensitivity." At the same time, he proposes a theory of "not reaching the peak" similar to that of Lessing and Coleridge, and like Einstein, he is good at using "two-sided thinking" to integrate and compare, and then create a theoretical form that combines narration, argumentation, wit, and appreciation. This theoretical form is based on empathy, from the inside out, and repeated experience. He values immersing himself in life, conducting on-site investigations, and cherishing the freshness of first impressions. He also values the creative discoveries in inspiration, intuition, and enlightenment. He often "writes theory as if it were creation," almost constantly immersed in the excitement of creation. Once he has an insight, he eagerly pours that unique feeling onto paper and then undergoes "re-experience."

The vast and profound, diverse yet unified, is the overall "framework" of Wang Chaowen's aesthetic palace. The theories of "beauty is relationship," "not reaching the peak," and "one for ten" are the three "pillars" supporting this framework. However, from any angle, it can be seen that Wang Chaowen uses the aesthetic traditions of the Chinese nation as materials and, with an open mind, adopts some views from foreign cultures. He then constructs his aesthetic palace in the unique national conditions of contemporary China.

Wang Chaowen's aesthetics are, in fact, an Eastern "experiential aesthetics."

    东方“体验美学”的奥秘
    ——读《王朝闻集》
    李哲良
    计十六卷之多、约七百万言的系列文集《王朝闻集》，由四川美术出版社出版了。这套文集，包括了王朝闻已发表和未发表的全部文论，已发表的按写作年代和出版的先后为序，分卷编次；未发表的部分，则按写作时间，作为外编收入相应的卷次。
    人们戏称王朝闻为“庞然大物”，又说他是艺术上的“通才”和“不务正业”的“杂家”，都说明了他的博大精深。不难发现，他善于领会毛泽东的军事辩证法，并巧妙地运用于艺术辩证法中。这主要体现在他的《一以当十》等著作里；他很欣赏周恩来从容处理内政外交的才能，并灵活地用来解决艺术中的矛盾，如《论艺术的技巧》等；他还把鲁迅倡导的散兵战和持久战的斗争方式，成功地用来与形而上学进行韧的战斗，如《论凤姐》的写作。他既从儒家那里继承了进取、互补与中和之美，如《再再探索》；也从道家那里汲取了虚静、自然和超脱精神；还从佛禅那里获得了机趣、顿悟和灵感，如《审美的敏感》。同时，他也像莱辛和柯勒律治那样提出了与之相映成趣的“不到顶点”论，也像爱因斯坦那样善于用“两面神思维”方式来融会贯通、综合比较，然后创造出一种熔叙述、论证、机趣和欣赏于一炉的“创作式”理论形态。这种理论形态，是以设身处地、从内到外和反复体验为基础的。他很重视深入生活，实地考察，十分珍惜第一印象的新鲜感，也很重视灵感、直觉和顿悟中的创造性发现。他往往“把理论当做创作来写”，几乎整天都沉浸在创造的激情状态之中，一旦有所得，便迫不及待地把那种独特感受倾泻在纸上，尔后又进行“再体验”。
    博大精深、杂多统一，是王朝闻美学之宫的整体“框架”。而“美是关系”说、“不到顶点”论和“一以当十”观，则是支撑这个框架的三根“轴心”。但不论从哪个角度来审视，都可看出王朝闻是以中华民族美学传统的土石为材料，又以开放性的眼光采纳了外来文化的某些观点，然后在中国当代特有的国情中来营造他的美学之宫的。
    王朝闻的美学，实际上是东方式的“体验美学”。
