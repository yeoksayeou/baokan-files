As soon as December began, Parisians were busy preparing for Christmas. The main streets in the city center, such as the Champs-Élysées, were adorned with festive lights on the buildings and along the sides of the roads. Large and small shops were decorated with Christmas trees and colorful ornaments and ribbons, while children eagerly awaited the gifts Santa Claus would bring them.

However, as the holiday approached, it did not bring only joy; the shadow of terrorist activities also loomed over this Western metropolis. Late last month, Spanish police arrested eight members of a Middle Eastern terrorist organization and seized 200 kilograms of explosives, as well as maps of Paris airports. Their plan was to carry out bombings during the Christmas to New Year period or during the trial of another terrorist leader in Paris in January. The news spread fear among many French people.

Recently, France's Security Committee held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures and take actions to prevent and combat terrorist activities. The interior ministers of the 12 European Community countries also held a meeting in Paris to discuss counter-terrorism and drug eradication, aiming to take joint actions. France's security departments have been mobilized, with fully armed police and sniffer dogs patrolling the metro and commercial centers; major public buildings and government institutions are heavily guarded, with armed guards vigilantly watching the surroundings; border police have strengthened patrols in border areas to prevent terrorists from entering the country, and airport security has conducted stricter checks on passengers' luggage. Paris before Christmas is on high alert, enveloped in a tense atmosphere.

It is reported that a Middle Eastern terrorist organization has meticulously prepared for this operation. As early as two or three months ago, two large containers weighing several tons each were shipped from the Middle East to Marseille and Valence. Police in Valence intercepted a container from a Middle Eastern import-export company in Valence, finding 200 kilograms of high-efficiency bombs, detonators, and hand grenades hidden inside cans disguised as food and jam. Following the leads, police discovered the organization's logistics supply points in Marseille and other locations. Intelligence agents are currently tracking down the suspects.

Why Paris has once again become a target for terrorist organizations, local media speculate, may be related to the deep involvement of the French Socialist Party government in Middle Eastern affairs, which has created many enemies and accumulated grievances, thus putting France in an unfavorable position in the Middle East.

People may spend the most important traditional holiday in the West in anxiety and fear. Whether the Socialist Party government's anti-terrorism efforts will be effective remains to be seen.

    巴黎圣诞节前的阴影
    本报记者　吕网大
    刚进入12月，巴黎的人们就忙碌着准备过圣诞节。位于市中心的爱丽舍大街等主要街道的建筑物和道路两侧的树上挂满了节日的彩灯，大大小小的商店用圣诞树和五光十色的彩球、彩带装扮一新，孩子们则翘首期待着圣诞老人给他们送来各种礼物。
    然而，日益临近的节日带来的并不全是欢乐，恐怖活动的阴影也悄悄笼罩着这个西方大都市。上月底，西班牙警方逮捕了中东一恐怖组织的8名成员，查获了200公斤的爆炸物，以及巴黎机场地图，他们的行动计划是在圣诞节至新年期间或明年1月巴黎审判另一恐怖组织头目时，进行爆炸破坏活动。消息传出，不少法国人感到惊恐。
    不久前，法国安全委员会召开紧急会议，研究对策，采取措施，以防范和打击恐怖活动。欧共同体12国内政部长也在巴黎召开会议，就反恐怖、扫毒等问题进行磋商，以采取共同行动。法国安全部门已紧急动员起来，全副武装的警察牵着警犬在地铁、商业中心来回巡逻；主要公共建筑物及政府机构戒备森严，手持冲锋枪的警卫人员警惕地注视着四周；边防警察也加强了边境地区的警戒，以防恐怖分子潜入国境，机场安全部门对过往旅客的行李进行了加倍严格检查……圣诞节前的巴黎如临大敌，处于紧张的气氛之中。
    据悉，中东某个恐怖组织为此次开始的行动进行了精心准备，早在两三个月前就有两个重达数吨的集装箱从中东运到马赛和瓦朗斯，警方在瓦朗斯的中东一家进出口公司截获这个集装箱，在伪装成食品和果酱的罐头内，查出200公斤高效炸弹、雷管、手榴弹等爆炸物，根据线索，警方又找到了恐怖组织在马赛等地的后勤供应点。特工人员正在追查之中。
    巴黎为什么会又一次成为恐怖组织打击的目标，此间舆论认为，这可能与法国社会党政府在中东插足过深，树敌积怨较多，因而在中东地区处于不利形势不无关系。
    人们也许将在不安和惊恐中度过西方最重要的传统节日。社会党政府反恐怖活动能够取得多少成效，人们对此并不抱太大希望。（本报巴黎电）
