    The Lesson from a Single Rule
    Xǔ Bóxián

    "During the season when the yangmei berries ripen each year, no one in the family is allowed to go to Yangmei Mountain."

    This rule was set by the Party Secretary of Xingtan Township in Shaoxing County, a major yangmei-producing area in Zhejiang, for himself and his family of five. In the nine years since he took office, no one in his family has ever violated this rule. Under his influence, officials in this township rarely go to the mountain when the yangmei berries are ripe.

    In recent years, a small number of people in our Party and government departments have used their power to seek personal gain. The "personal" mentioned here should include the individual, as well as their relatives and children.

    When the masses evaluate a Party member or a leading cadre, they not only look at the individual's actions but also observe whether their family members or friends have taken advantage of their position and influence to seek personal gain.

    Cherishing the power bestowed by the Party and the people is a crucial issue that many comrades, especially leading cadres, cannot avoid. The aforementioned Party Secretary's proactive measures to prevent minor issues from becoming major problems and to set rules for himself and his family are precisely a manifestation of cherishing this power. Therefore, it is easy to understand why he has received praise from the masses.

    There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Without rules, nothing can be accomplished."

    The phrase "following the rules" probably originates from this. Here, without discussing historical figures who have set family rules and guidelines to regulate the behavior of family members, it is worth noting that modern people also pay great attention to setting rules for themselves. Recently, I read an article titled "Zhou Enlai's 'Family Rules' and Liu Shaoqi's 'Clean Rules'" in a magazine, which gave me a lot of insight. The article introduced Zhou Enlai's lifelong dedication to clean governance and setting an example for others, including his ten unwritten "family rules" such as "descendants are not allowed to leave their work to visit him, and anyone visiting him must go to the canteen to buy food"; Liu Shaoqi also had similar rules for his staff, known as the "four no's."

    The revolutionary predecessors' self-discipline and regulation of their own and their relatives' behavior not only reflect their strict self-discipline but also demonstrate their awareness of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Party and the government. Thus, they set an example for all Party members and cadres, earning the respect and love of the entire Party and the nation.

    The above two examples not only illustrate the necessity and urgency of rectifying Party style and building a clean government at present but also provide a lesson: to promote the clean governance of our country, we must indeed strengthen the ideological education of all Party members and cadres, quickly establish and improve necessary systems, and strive to create a good external environment. As a member of the ruling party and a servant of the people, it is crucial to subjectively compare oneself to the Party member standards and cadre conduct norms, frequently examine one's words and deeds, and consciously strive to promote good and suppress evil. Above all, one must not overlook this.

### 一条戒规的启示

    一条戒规的启示
    许伯贤
      “每年杨梅成熟季节，全家人谁也不许上杨梅山。”
    这条“戒规”，是浙江杨梅产地之一的绍兴县型塘乡党委书记为自己和一家5口人立下的。自他任职9年来，全家人谁也未曾违犯。在他的影响下，这个乡的干部也很少在杨梅熟了的时候上山。
    近些年在我们党和政府部门中，极少数人利用手中的权力为个人谋取私利。这里所说的“个人”，应该包含本人及其亲属子女等。
    群众在评价一个党员或领导干部时，除了看其本人所为，还要察其家属乃至亲朋友好有否借其地位和影响为自己谋私行为？
    珍惜党和人民赋予的权力，是摆在许多同志尤其是领导干部面前的一个不容回避的课题。上述那位党委书记防微杜渐、自觉为自己和一家人立“戒规”，正是珍惜这种权力的表现。由此而受到群众的赞扬就不难理解了。
    我国有条古训叫做：没有规矩，不成方圆。
    所谓循规蹈矩，大概源出于此。这里，且不说历史上一些有所作为者以立“家规”设“家训”来规范家庭成员行为的不乏其例。
    今人其实也是很注重立规束己的。近在一份刊物上读了《周恩来的“家规”和刘少奇的“清规”》一文，颇有感触。文中介绍了周恩来一生为政清廉、以身作则，生前曾立有“晚辈不得丢下工作专程去看望他，凡去看望他的人一律到食堂排队买饭菜”等10条不成文的“家规”；刘少奇也一样，对他身边工作人员交代了“四不准”的规矩。
    革命前辈们这种自觉约束自己和亲属行为的举动，不仅反映了他们严以律己的品质，也表现出了维护党和政府根本利益的自觉性，从而，为全体党员和干部树立了榜样，获得了全党和全国人民的崇敬和爱戴。
    上述两件事例，除了从一个侧面说明当前端正党风和建设廉政的必要性、紧迫性外，也给人们以启示，即：要推进我国的廉政建设，固然要加强对全体党员和干部的思想教育，尽快建立和完善必要的制度，努力创造良好的外部环境，作为一名执政党党员、一个人民公仆，主观上能时时对照党员标准和干部行为准则，经常地检点自己一言一行，自觉做到扬正抑邪，尤其是万万不能忽视的。
