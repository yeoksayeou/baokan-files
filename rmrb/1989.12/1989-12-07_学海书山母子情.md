The People's Daily, December 7, 1989

Kang Zhongqi, a female worker at the third metallurgical construction company's electrical equipment company in Anshan, is in her fifties. With only seven years of education, she has managed to nurture her 19-year-old son, Chu Hui, who is completely deaf and mute, into China's first deaf and disabled university graduate. Together, mother and son have composed a deeply moving and inspiring song of learning.

In 1979, due to a medical accident, Chu Hui lost his hearing completely, entering a silent world at the age of nine. Despite his parents' and doctors' best efforts, his hearing could not be restored. At nine years old, just as his life's journey was beginning, what would his future hold? The anguish and despair of Chu Hui's parents left them with a few options: to raise him comfortably, ensuring he had no wants, fulfilling their parental duties? To send him to a school for the deaf and mute, allowing him to find a suitable job and support himself? Or to overcome the difficulties and cultivate him, enabling him to master advanced knowledge and contribute to the country, though this seemed nearly impossible!

Chu Hui, however, was a very stubborn child. His mother had once taken him to a school for the deaf and mute, hoping to follow the second plan. But as soon as Chu Hui saw the school's sign, he burst into tears. He told his mother, in a way only she could understand, "I can't learn the language of the deaf and mute. My ears will get better. Please send me to a regular school."

His mother's heart ached. She held her beloved son tightly, tears streaming down her face. Over the years, she had taken him to the best hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenyang, but the verdict was always the same: there was no hope of recovery. The family had spent almost everything on his treatment, and it was clear that his parents had done all they could.

On a snowy night in December 1984, two unexpected guests arrived at the Chu family's home. They were Chu Hui's great-aunt and great-uncle. They brought with them that day's edition of the "Anshan Worker's Daily," pointing to an advertisement for correspondence courses at the Liaoning Literature Institute. They urged Chu Hui's parents to send him to study. As a teacher at Anshan Steel, Chu Hui's great-uncle, Cao Hongpu, volunteered to tutor Chu Hui if there were any difficulties. At that moment, Kang Zhongqi seemed to find a way out of the tangled web that had plagued her for years. She decided on the spot to enroll herself in the courses, return home to teach Chu Hui, and strive to help him master advanced literary knowledge.

Thus, in the classrooms of the Literature Institute, one could always see an "old student" who arrived earliest, sat in the front row, remembered the most, asked the most questions, and left the latest. From the instructors to the dean, almost everyone recognized her.

The journey from home to school was over 20 miles. Kang Zhongqi would go straight from work to class, and upon returning home, despite her hunger and fatigue from operating the hoist all day, she would immediately share the day's lessons with her son. She would show him her notes, and the intelligent and eager son would learn voraciously. About two hours later, her son would also "finish class." But Kang Zhongqi still couldn't rest. Her son had been alone all day and had a lot to say, but in the world, only his mother would listen to him seriously. If his mother didn't stay up to chat with him, who would? So, going to bed at 12 a.m. became a routine.

Once, Kang Zhongqi caught a cold and dragged herself home after class. After dinner, she couldn't move and leaned against the bed. But her son, seemingly unaware of his mother's illness, handed her his book bag as usual. Kang Zhongqi looked at her son's expectant eyes, patted his head lovingly, took the bag, and walked out. She struggled not to fall or cry. Although she was almost late and found it hard to take notes that day, she managed to complete the lesson. When she returned home, she was sweating profusely, her face flushed, her heart racing, and her head spinning. But she struggled not to collapse, played a game of "author and work fill-in-the-blank" with her son, and then went to bed. That night, she slept very soundly.

On a snowy night, Kang Zhongqi, with her book bag slung over her shoulder, pushed her bicycle through the thick snow. The snow was still falling, and many sections were impassable. She had to push and ride in turns. When she finally stumbled home, her clothes were almost soaked, and her bicycle had become a walking stick. The 10-mile journey had exhausted her strength. As she climbed the stairs to open the door, she felt a sudden pang in her heart—her keys weren't in her pocket. In an instant, fatigue, frustration, and even resentment filled her heart, blurring her vision with tears...

Knocking on the door was useless and would only wake the neighbors. There was only one option: to wait. The third-floor corridor was occasionally swept by cold winds, making her wet clothes stick to her body like ice. She stomped her feet, but standing still was no relief from the bone-chilling cold. She went back outside to the snow, stomping her feet and rubbing her hands to keep warm. Finally, after more than two hours, it was nearly midnight. Chu Hui seemed to sense something and came out with a flashlight. Seeing his mother like a snowman, he rushed over and hugged her, crying loudly. His mother led her son back inside, changed out of her wet clothes, and began teaching him again. But Chu Hui was disobedient this time; he insisted that his mother rest. Seeing her son's consideration and maturity, Kang Zhongqi felt a surge of love. Her previous complaints, frustrations, and fatigue vanished. That night, mother and son didn't sleep much, but Kang Zhongqi felt she had slept more soundly than ever.

Kang Zhongqi could overcome physical and material difficulties, but cultural barriers were insurmountable. She had only seven years of education, and after a gap of over 30 years, learning university courses with a junior high school foundation was beyond her. Especially when studying "Ancient Chinese," many terms like "exegesis" and "correction" and various sentence patterns made her struggle. She hadn't even understood them herself, and teaching her son only made her more confused. Once, when she tried to explain "tonality," she struggled but couldn't make it clear. Her son, seeing her lips moving more and more incoherently, wrote it down but only made it more chaotic. Finally, her son exploded: "It's too hard! You can't explain it either. I'll just stop learning. What's the use of all this effort?"

Her son's words pierced Kang Zhongqi's heart. Frustration, resentment, and guilt overwhelmed her, and tears streamed down her face.

Seeing his mother cry, Chu Hui immediately realized he had made a mistake. He knelt before his mother, tears streaming down his face, saying, "Mom, don't cry. I won't make you angry anymore. I'll study hard and do well."

After a bout of crying, mother and son wiped their tears and resumed studying "tonality."

One incident must be mentioned. On June 4, 1985, the Literature Institute held an exam at the 62nd Middle School. After explaining all the exam details to Chu Hui, Kang Zhongqi waited outside the school. Twenty minutes after the exam started, the dean of the Literature Institute, Tang Jinnian, came to inspect the exam room. Due to Kang Zhongqi's distinctive appearance, the teachers and staff at the Literature Institute were familiar with her. Seeing Kang Zhongqi not in the exam room, Tang Jinnian was puzzled. He asked, "Old friend, the exam has been going on for over 20 minutes. Why aren't you in the exam room yet?" Kang Zhongqi knew who he was but didn't want to reveal her deepest pain to others. She struggled to hold back her tears and said, "My son is in there taking the exam." Who knew that Tang Jinnian misunderstood her, thinking it was a case of "impersonation." He immediately ordered a check of the students' credentials. The results showed no discrepancies. Tang Jinnian then realized his mistake but still didn't understand the situation. He politely invited Kang Zhongqi to the office and asked again. This time, Kang Zhongqi had no choice but to reveal the truth to everyone. The scene of her crying and speaking from the heart made Tang Jinnian and all present feel a deep sense of sorrow, and tears flowed.

After much struggle, Chu Hui finally saw results. In June 1986, at the graduation ceremony of the first batch of correspondence students at the Liaoning Literature Institute, he received his first university diploma. With excellent scores of 91 in Ancient Chinese and 94 in Literary Theory, he ranked first in both subjects, earning praise from the dean, Yu Tie.

One might think that with his condition, obtaining a university diploma should be enough. Especially considering the nearly 1,000 extraordinary days and nights his mother had spent, he was deeply grateful. However, he observed the world with a calm and keen eye, unique to his age, and embraced life with a deep and passionate love. He noticed a period when a "diploma craze" swept through society, and various "universities" and "college classes" sprouted like mushrooms. Almost all that was left of the university's solemnity and sanctity was the moment the diploma was issued. Then, the organizers began counting their money, and the graduates, holding their gilded diplomas, bargained with their superiors.

These observations stirred waves in Chu Hui's otherwise calm heart. One day, he said to his mother, "Mom, although I have a university diploma, I still want to study. What do you think?" His mother understood that he wanted to pursue the "hard-nosed" self-study exam for academic achievement.

It should be noted that due to the social nature of self-study exams, students come and go freely, without restrictions, and teachers only provide general guidance. Therefore, the pass rate is very low. For example, in 1984, the pass rate for "Ancient Literature" was only 11.4%, and many diploma seekers hit a red light here—no way through.

Now, Chu Hui was attempting to climb the peak of Mount Everest from another route, and the dangers and hardships were evident. Seeing her son's eager and confident eyes, Kang Zhongqi bit her lip and agreed.

This time, however, Kang Zhongqi didn't have to suffer as much. Chu Hui could independently sort out the key points from the vast amount of material and compile a systematic set of notes. With enough time, he could also refer to relevant materials to help him understand and remember new courses. He had fully developed his self-study abilities. Thus, he successfully completed one subject after another. By October 1987, he boldly took on four subjects at once, and all four passed. He obtained his second diploma in three years, one he was truly satisfied with, and he was overjoyed.

On that day, mother and son cried together, a cry of joy and victory. Ten years had passed, and this day was finally their celebration.

In 1988, he saw the "People and Society" essay contest launched by the "People's Daily" and was inspired to write about his mother. He titled his piece "My Mother Went to College for Me," singing the praises of a great mother and respected teacher. The plain and simple text, clear and concise narration, and the short but brilliant, powerful, and inspiring content made it a standout piece. This essay was awarded first prize by the "People's Daily" and the China Disabled Persons' Federation.

Now, Chu Hui is working on compiling a "Index of Titles and Authors of Ming Dynasty Works." This is a reference book that aims to list all Ming Dynasty authors and their works, a task of immense difficulty and breadth. But he is determined to complete it...

On August 29, 1989, was another joyous day. Due to Chu Hui's outstanding achievements and after thorough evaluations, it was proven that despite his deafness, he was fully capable of handling some textual work. Therefore, the third metallurgical construction company decided to exceptionally hire him as a staff member of the "Three Metallurgical News." Thus, the mother and son's struggle in the sea of learning came to an end, or rather, was marked with an exclamation point. Because in our society, such cases are indeed rare. Therefore, Chu Hui is lucky, lucky to be born in our great country, bathed in the Party's sunlight—it is the radiance of a great mother's love. Everyone who knows him and those who don't are happy for him, happy for our bright educational prospects. The sun has risen! But it belongs only to those who are diligent, hardworking, and never stop climbing.

    学海书山母子情
    刘群
    鞍山第三冶金建筑公司电装公司卷扬机操作女工康忠琦，年已半百，只有7年文化基础，却把自己全聋半哑的19岁儿子褚晖，培养成我国第一个聋残大学生。母子两人谱写了一曲感人肺腑、催人上进的求学之歌。
    1979年，由于一次意外的医疗事故，褚晖的耳朵完全失听，从此进入了无声世界。这时他9岁。尽管他的父母用全部的情爱，医生尽最大的可能，也没有挽回颓势，小褚晖的耳朵没有治愈。9岁，人生的道路刚刚开始，他今后该怎么办？心田被焦灼烤裂了的褚晖父母，在哀痛和失望中，干涩的目光在几个方案间徘徊：养起来，让他吃喝穿戴不受委屈，尽为人父母的责任？送到聋哑学校，将来找一个力所能及的工作，让他自食其力？克服困难，培养他，让他掌握高层次的文化知识，用所学之长为国家多做贡献，但是这谈何容易！
    褚晖却是个非常倔犟的孩子。妈妈曾领着他来到聋哑学校，试图采用第二个方案。没想到褚晖刚见到学校的牌子就大哭起来。他用只有妈妈才听得懂的话说：“我不能学聋哑人的话，我的耳朵会好的，你还是送我到正常人学校去吧！”
    妈妈心如刀绞。她搂着可爱的独生子泪如雨下。几年来，她领着孩子几乎跑遍了北京、上海、重庆、沈阳那些堪属一流的大医院，但结论是一致的，已经没有治愈的希望了。家里为治病，几乎倾其所有，可以说，父母已经尽到最大努力了。
    1984年12月一个风雪交加之夜，褚家来了两个不速之客。客人是褚晖的姑姥爷和姑姥姥。他们揣来了当天的《鞍工日报》，指着“辽宁文学院函授招生”的启事，要褚晖的父母送褚晖去学习。身为鞍钢职工教师的姑姥爷曹洪普当时表态道：如果有困难，他愿意辅导褚晖的学习。这时，康忠琦似乎从纠缠自己多年的一团乱线中找到了头绪，她当即决定由自己去学习，回来再教给褚晖，争取让褚晖掌握高层次的文学知识。
    于是，在文学院的课堂上，总能看到一个到得最早、坐得最靠前、记得最多、发问最勤又走得最晚的“老学员”，从授课教师到教务长，几乎都认识她。
    从家到学校，往返有20多里路。康忠琦下班直接去上学，放学回家后，她不顾饥肠辘辘和开了一天卷扬机的劳累，放下书包便把当天学的内容一一向儿子转述，把笔记本给他看，聪明灵慧的儿子便如饥似渴地学起来。约两个小时，儿子也“下课”了。但康忠琦还是不能休息。儿子在家寂寞了一天，还有满肚子的话要倾吐，可世界上能认真听他讲话的，只有母亲，妈妈不陪着说些心里话，谁陪着呢？这样，每天12点睡觉，便成了家常便饭。
    一次，康忠琦感冒了，强拖着身子挨到了家。吃完饭，她再也不想动，便倚在了床上。可儿子却似乎没有察觉妈妈的病态，他照旧收拾好书包，放到妈妈手边。康忠琦看着儿子期待的目光，慈爱地摸了摸儿子的头，接过书包转身走了出去。她努力不让自己摔倒，不让自己流泪。尽管这次她差点迟到，笔记比平时记得吃力，但她终于学完了这一课的内容。回到家时，她头上冒着虚汗，脸上泛着潮红，心慌乏力，头重脚轻，但她努力不让自己瘫倒，仍然和儿子玩了一会儿“作家作品填空”游戏才睡下。这一夜，她睡得好沉呀。
    一个风雪夜，康忠琦斜背着书包，踏着厚厚的落雪推出车子准备回家。雪还在下，已积了厚厚的一层，很多路段根本无法骑行，她只能推一段骑一段。当她跌跌撞撞地赶回家，看到楼窗映出的灯光时，衣服已快湿透了，车子也成了拄着的拐棍，10里路的跋涉，已耗尽了她的力气。她一步一步挨上楼去准备开门时，不由得心里“咯噔”一下子，钥匙没在衣袋里。刹那间，疲劳、委屈以至恨怨，一起挤上心头，泪水模糊了眼睛……敲门是无济于事的，只能把邻居敲醒，只有“等”这一个办法了。三楼过道不时刮过阵阵寒风，使湿透的衣服开始像铁板一样凉冰冰地粘在身上。跺跺脚，不行，但干站着又无法抵御砭人肌骨的寒冷，她便又来到楼外雪地里，不停地跺脚搓手，活动着取暖。终于，两个多小时过去了，时间已近午夜，褚晖这时似乎察觉了什么，他打着手电来到楼外面，看到雪人似的妈妈，他猛地扑过去抱着妈妈放声大哭。妈妈拉着儿子回到家里，换下湿冷的衣服，又开始给儿子讲课。但褚晖却不听话了，他非要妈妈休息不可。看着儿子的体贴、懂事，康忠琦心中涌起阵阵怜爱，原来的埋怨、委屈、疲劳已无影无踪。这一夜，母子俩都没睡多少觉，可康忠琦却觉得比哪天都睡得香。
    体力上、物质上的困难，康忠琦完全有能力克服。但文化上的障碍，她实在难以逾越。她只有7年文化程度，中间隔了30多年，以初中一年级的基础学习大学课程，实在是力不从心。特别是学习“古代汉语”时，许多名词如“训诂”、“拗救”等以及各类句式的判断，更使她难以招架。她自己还没有弄懂，教儿子时，更是越讲越糊涂。有一次，她给儿子讲“平仄”，费了好大劲也没讲明白。儿子看她的口型越来越不得要领，她用笔写也是越写越乱。儿子终于发火了：“太难了，你也讲不明白，还得我自己查书，干脆不学了算了，学这有什么用？还不是白费这么大的劲！”孩子的话深深刺痛了康忠琦的心，委屈、恨怨以至内疚，一齐袭上她的心头，不知不觉间，伤心的泪水涌流如注……
    看到妈妈流泪了，褚晖马上意识到自己闯了大祸。他扑过去跪在妈妈面前，流着泪说：“妈妈，您别哭了，我再也不惹您生气了，我一定听您的话，把学习搞好。”
    母子二人痛哭一阵之后，擦干泪水，重又开始攻读“平仄”。
    这里不能不提一下这样一件事。1985年6月4日，文学院在市第62中学考场考试。康忠琦把一应考试事务向褚晖交代明白后，便在学校门口等着。开考20分钟后，文学院教务长到考场检查。由于康忠琦的特殊形象早就为文学院的老师和工作人员熟悉了，所以教务长唐如今和随行人员在车上就发现了康忠琦。看到康忠琦没有参加考试，唐教务长有些纳闷了，他问道：“老同学，都开考20多分钟了，你怎么还不入场啊？”康忠琦何尝不知道面前的人是谁，但她却不愿意把自己最痛苦的心事向别人表露，她强忍住就要冲出来的泪水，向教务长说：“我儿子在里边考呢。”谁知道教务长却误解了康忠琦的意思，他以为这是在上演一出“冒名顶替”的闹剧。他马上下令检查考生的有关证件。结果无一破绽。唐如今这时才觉得自己有些冒失，但还是不明白这是怎么回事。于是，他客客气气把康忠琦请到办公室，再一次询问究竟。这时，康忠琦才不得不把实情向大家倾吐。那声泪俱下的场面，使唐教务长和所有在场的人，都感到心里阵阵酸楚，流出了眼泪。
    经一番拚搏，褚晖终于有了收获。1986年6月，他在辽宁文学院的首届函授毕业生典礼上，拿到了第一张大学文凭，而且以古代汉语91分和文艺理论94分的优秀成绩名列两项第一，受到于铁院长的表扬。
    按说，以他这样的条件，能得到大学文凭，应该“知足”了。特别是，近1000个非寻常可比的日夜，他的母亲所付出的代价，他是感同身受的。但是，他却用同龄人所没有的冷静而敏锐的目光去观察世界，用独有的、热烈而深沉的情爱去拥抱生活。他看到有一段时间刮起一阵文凭风，于是如雨后春笋般蜂涌而起的各类“大学”和“大专班”，差不多只有在颁发文凭的那一刻才有大学里的庄严和神圣。然后，办学者开始清点钞票，就学者则拿着烫金文凭向领导讨价还价。
    这些，在褚晖平静的心海掀起了层层波澜。一天，他对妈妈说：“妈妈，我虽然有了一个大学文凭，可我还想学，您看怎么样？”妈妈明白，他要上的，是在社会上被称为“硬骨头”的自学成才考试。
    这里插一句。由于自学考试是社会性的，学员来去由之，不受约束，教师辅导也只是海阔天空“侃”一遍，所以考成功者寥寥。如1984年考“古代文学”，及格率仅11.4％，许多混文凭的人在这里遇上红灯——此路不通。
    现在，褚晖无异从另一条道攀登珠峰，其艰险、辛劳是可想而知的。康忠琦看到儿子期待而充满自信的目光，咬咬牙答应了下来。
    但这次学习，却无需康忠琦像以前那样吃苦了。褚晖自己完全可以从浩繁的资料中理出重点，整理出一套系统的笔记。由于他有足够的时间，他还能参考有关的资料，来帮助自己对新课程的理解和记忆。他已完全具备了自学能力。这样，他的自学科目，一科一科地被他顺利攻下，到1987年10月，他索性大包大揽，一下子考了4科，而4科又全部合格。他用了3年时间，拿到了第2个文凭，而且是自己满意的文凭，高兴极了。
    这一天，母子两人都痛痛快快地哭了一场。但这是高兴的、胜利的哭。10年了，这一天才是母子两人的节日。
    1988年，他看到《人民日报》发起“残疾人与社会”征文，勾起他无限情思，他以《妈妈替我上大学》为题，讴歌了一位伟大的母亲、尊敬的师长的动人形象。文字平淡朴实，叙述清晰明了，短短的篇幅中，蕴藏着夺目的光彩、巨大的力量和无限的启迪。这篇散文，被《人民日报》、中国残疾人联合会主办单位评为一等奖。
    现在，褚晖正在着手编撰一部《明文海篇名与作者索引》。这是一部工具书，要将明代的作家作品全部罗列其中，其难度之大、涉及面之广，可想而知。但他有决心把它完成……
    1989年8月29日，是又一个令人高兴的日子。由于褚晖取得了优异的成绩，经多方考核，证明他虽耳聋，但完全能够胜任一些文字工作，所以，第三冶金建设公司决定，破格录用他为《三冶报》工作人员。至此，在学海书山拚搏的母与子，以褚晖的被录用划上了句号，不，是划上了惊叹号。因为在我们周围，这样的事实在是凤毛麟角。所以，褚晖是幸运的，幸运在他生长在我们伟大的国度，沐浴着党的阳光——那是一个伟大母亲的爱的光辉。每个认识和不认识他的人都在为他高兴，为我们光明的教育前景高兴。太阳升起来了！可它只属于那些勤奋、刻苦、攀登不止的人……
