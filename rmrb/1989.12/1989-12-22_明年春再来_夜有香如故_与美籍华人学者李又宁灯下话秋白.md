It is already late autumn, but Changzhou is still mild and sunny. The car drove into a courtyard surrounded by autumn trees, and in front of the grand steps filled with distinguished guests, I saw the words "Jiangnan Spring" written by 93-year-old Mr. Liu Haishu on the wall of the hotel, and my heart truly felt a bit of spring.

The academic symposium commemorating the 90th anniversary of Qu Qiubai's birth was held here. On the opening day, a dignified American-Chinese female scholar arrived gracefully. She was of average height, wearing a short red woolen coat and a green necktie, with a calm demeanor and a beautiful appearance. When the host invited her to speak, she said, "In the poems left by Mr. Qu Qiubai, it is said: 'Surely next spring will come again, the night still fragrant as before.' Today, in 'Jiangnan Spring,' commemorating his 90th birthday, I think the poet will be pleased in his grave." She was Professor Li Youning from St. John's University in New York.

During the break, the director of the Qu Qiubai Memorial Hall, Mr. Zhao Genglin, told me: Professor Li Youning invited me to have dinner together. Although we were meeting for the first time, we were not strangers, because "Unending Qu Qiubai" had already made us seem familiar.

Li Youning can also be called a "bookworm." Her cradle years were spent in Chongqing during the War of Resistance. Later, she moved with her grandparents to a remote village in Fuding to attend primary school, and soon after, she went to Fuzhou to attend middle school. During her middle school years, she discovered her weakness: she lacked a mathematical mind. However, she felt she had a natural imagination, often leading her to roam through history, and the historical figures in her imagination were almost inseparable from her. Thus, she fell in love with the history major. She is a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University and currently a graduate advisor in history at St. John's University. She has written "Qin Shihuang," "Biography of Wu Han," and "Marxism and China."

The cold, quiet, elusive, and confusing life of a historian, filled with both bitterness and joy, has shaped her rich and colorful historical perspective. She devoted her youth to the study of Chinese history, which she considers a great fortune. Because China has a long history and a brilliant culture, it allows her to fly freely. She said, "I can live in the past thousand years, and I can also stand in the present century. I can chat with Confucius, and I can travel with Zhuangzi. I can consult Sun Yat-sen, and I can consult Mao Zedong." However, "if history is just a compilation of records, then why do I need to be here? I study people first, historical people. I must use my heart to understand historical figures, and history will then be connected and intertwined with me." She believes that repeating others will lead research to wither.

So, who has she been spiritually connected with all this time, giving her a unique feeling? That is Qu Qiubai, or at least he is the first one.

As early as when she was studying at the history department of Taiwan University, an article by Professor Ai Jian about "Hungry Village Journey," "Red Capital Heart History," and "Extra Words," sparked her deep interest, especially "A Soft-hearted Communist" which led her to deep thought. During the days and nights of studying Qu's works, a mysterious great man quietly entered her heart. She was moved by him and also suffered for him. She said, "Perhaps because Qu Qiubai had a serious and strong sense of mission, while I did not, I especially admire him; perhaps because of the tragic and legendary nature of a life intertwined with miracles and misfortune, I am particularly fascinated by him. Of course, he also had a lifelong scholar's habit, making me very familiar with him."

Li Youning picked up a thin mint-flavored Cadence cigarette for women and lit it, pausing for a moment before saying, "I also believe that Qu Qiubai is someone who is approachable and can exchange ideas with, and someone with a broad mind. If you criticize him, he will smile at you." Li Youning finally wrote her graduation thesis "Qu Qiubai's Youth" (up to 1928), expressing her understanding of Qu Qiubai. Her teacher, Weimuting, saw in her article a deep-thinking, emotionally rich, and individualistic Chinese literary politician, encouraging her to write Qu's biography. Just as she was filled with emotions and deep in thought, the "Cultural Revolution" storm swept across China, and the figures she admired overnight became "traitors." She fell into sadness and confusion. However, she still managed to complete Qu Qiubai's life story. Just as she was considering publication, Qu suddenly gained rehabilitation in people's anticipation. New materials emerged one after another, and some historical mysteries began to unravel, naturally making her dissatisfied with this biography. At this time, she discovered more and more Chinese intellectuals with Qu's thought and temperament, and she wondered why. The more she pursued, the deeper she went. She said to me, "If I were to rewrite Qu's biography, it would no longer be just 'this one' Qu Qiubai. He might be a microcosm of outstanding Chinese intellectuals."

Her words aroused my curiosity, and I thought of a question: "What aspect of Qu's character makes you most moved?"

"Touching sincerity and astonishing frankness. Although there are many brilliant figures in Chinese history, and many who are more learned than Qu, there are few who are as sincere and frank as him. However, Qu's sincerity and frankness were not understood by people during his lifetime and after his death. It is really regrettable!"

I smiled and said to her, "Isn't this precisely a problem worth studying for historians?"

At this time, Li Youning, lost in thought, began to talk about "historical misunderstandings." I guessed she might say this is a reflection of a "dog-tilling" mentality and a sense of historical responsibility. However, no, she sighed and said, "Why has this concept troubled so many scholars? If readers of history do not understand 'historical misunderstandings,' they will also find it difficult to understand Qu."

"A fragile dual personality?" She asked me tentatively.

I thought for a moment: "Qu is a strong communist warrior, but he regretted until his death that he had not overcome the consciousness and emotions of a hidden gentry class intellectual. Precisely because of this, he can sometimes be fragile in fierce struggles. As for those who talk about Qu's so-called 'dual personality' or 'psychological split,' I think it does not match Qu's character."

She seemed to agree, saying, "That is a kind of fragility within strength, negativity within positivity..."

Qu's former residence left a deep impression on Li Youning. In America, she had imagined Qu living in a temple, but now, seeing the scene from that time, she knew how the cruel reality had wounded a young man's heart. She said, "Why does the word 'loneliness' appear so often in Qu's poems and writings? Part of the answer can be found here."

During the visit, I said to Li Youning, "I like that photo: 'Qu and Zhihua in 1928 by the Black Sea,' Zhihua leaning on Qu, Qu leaning down and saying something to Zhihua..." Li Youning, however, pointed to another photo: "I like that sketch: it is a draft by Qu, with Xiao Duoyi crying in the distance, Qu skiing, and the corner written: 'Duoyi, why are you crying? Daddy is going skiing.'"

Li Youning asked me, "You must have gained inspiration from this photo and sketch for writing the screenplay for 'Autumn's White Flower'?" She also said that she had bought the VCD of the TV series "Qu's Death" and would play it for her family and friends in America. She eagerly hoped to see her imagined Qu on the screen.

At this moment, I couldn't help but blurt out, "You should be a writer, not a historian."

She laughed and said, "Writers should have a historical mind, and historians should have literary imagination!"

When we parted, friends came to see her off, and she shook hands with each one, saying, "Welcome to New York to visit. Those who travel together are not enemies."

Now, Li Youning has flown across the ocean and returned to her quiet study, perhaps she is having a spiritual dialogue with Qu! But the words she left before her departure, "There is no banquet that does not disperse, the golden autumn of 'Jiangnan Spring' is unforgettable," seem to still be echoing in my ears...

    明年春再来　夜有香如故
    ——与美籍华人学者李又宁灯下话秋白
    冒炘
    已是深秋时节，常州依然风和日丽。小车驶进了一所秋林掩映的高门大院，在贵宾如云的阶前，望见宾馆壁上由93岁刘海粟先生手书的“江南春”那三个大字，心里果真升起了几分春意。
    纪念瞿秋白诞生90周年学术讨论会就是在这里举行的。开幕那天，有一位仪态端庄的美籍华人女学者翩然而至。她身材不高，穿着绯红色短呢外套，绿色领结，举止安详，容颜秀丽。当主席邀她致词时，她说：“瞿秋白先生留下的诗中云：‘信是明年春再来，夜有香如故。’今天在‘江南春’纪念他的90诞辰，我想诗人会欣慰于九泉的。”她就是美国纽约圣约翰大学教授李又宁。
    休会时，瞿秋白纪念馆馆长赵庚林先生转告我：李又宁教授邀我共进晚餐。我们虽然初次相见，却并不陌生，因为“说不尽的秋白”早使我们似曾相识。
    李又宁也称得上一个“读书种子”。她的摇篮时代是在抗战时期的重庆度过的。后来随祖父母到了福鼎的一处穷乡僻壤读小学，不久又到福州上中学。中学时代，她发现了自己的弱点：没有数学头脑。但是她觉得有一种天赋的想象力，往往带领她遨游古今，想象中的历史人物几乎与她形影不离。于是她爱上了历史专业。她是哥伦比亚大学历史学博士，现任圣约翰大学历史学研究生导师。她写过《秦始皇》，也写过《吴晗传》，还写过《马克思主义与中国》。
    冷冷清清、寻寻觅觅、扑朔迷离，苦在其中，乐亦在其中的史学生涯，构成了她对丰富多采人生的历史感。她把青春都献给了中国史研究，她认为那是莫大的幸运。因为中国有悠久的历史，灿烂的文化，可以任她自由飞翔。她说：“我可以生活在千百年前，也可以站在当今世纪。可以与孔子聊天，也可以与庄子一起遨游。可以请教孙中山，也可以请教毛泽东。”但是，“倘若历史只是史料的汇编，那何必要我呢？我研究的首先是人，历史的人。我必须用我的心去了解历史人物，历史与我才有联系、交汇。”她认为重复别人，研究是会走向枯萎的。
    那么，与她神交至今，给了她独特感受的是谁呢？那就是瞿秋白，至少说，他是第一个。
    早在台大历史学系读书时，爱济安先生写的有关《饿乡纪程》、《赤都心史》及《多余的话》的文章，使她产生了浓厚的兴趣，特别是《一个软心肠的共产党员》引起了她的深沉的思索。在研读瞿著的日日夜夜，有一个谜一般的伟人悄然走进她的心扉。她为他激动过，也为他痛苦过。她说：“也许由于秋白有严肃而强烈的使命感，而我却没有，所以我特别敬爱他；也许由于奇迹与厄运交织一生的悲剧性与传奇性，使我特别迷恋他。当然，他还有终身未改的书生习气，使我非常熟悉他。”
    李又宁拿起一支专供女性用的薄荷卡登牌香烟吸了起来，沉吟一会儿，说：“我还自信秋白是一个令人亲近、可以交流思想的人，也是一个有雅量的人，如果批评他，他会对你微笑的。”李又宁终于以她的毕业论文《瞿秋白的青少年时代》（写至1928年），写出了她所理解的瞿秋白。老师韦慕庭看到她写的文章中出现了一个思想深邃、感情丰富而又有个性的中国文人政治家，便鼓励她写瞿传。正当她心潮涌动、苦苦思索的时候，“文革”风暴席卷了中国大地，她所敬爱的人物旦夕之间变成了“叛徒”。她陷入了悲哀与困惑。但是，她还是勉为其难地写完了瞿秋白的一生。刚在考虑出版的瞬间，瞿突然在人们翘盼中获得平反了。新的史料陆续出现，历史上的谜有些也开始解开，自然她对这一本传也不满意了。这时，他还发现越来越多的中国文人，具有瞿那样的思想气质心态特点，原因在哪里？她越追寻，越深远。她对我说：“如果我重写瞿传，就不仅仅是‘这一个’瞿秋白了，他可能是中国优秀知识分子的一个缩影。”
    她的话驱使了我的好奇心，我想起了一个问题：“秋白性格中最使你为之激动的，是什么呢？”
    “感人的真诚和惊人的坦白。中国历史上的伟人灿若繁星，才学超过秋白的也大有人在，但是像他那样真诚坦白的人还是不多见的吧。不过，秋白的真诚和坦白在他生前身后都曾经不被人们所理解。实在令人遗憾！”
    我笑着对她说：“这不正是值得历史学者研究的一个问题吗？”
    这时，李又宁若有所思地谈起了“历史的误会”，我猜想她大概会讲这是一种“犬耕”心情与历史责任感的反映吧。然而，不，她叹息地说：“这概念为什么困扰了那么多有学问的人，读历史的人如果不懂得‘历史的误会’，也就难于理解秋白了。”
    “脆弱的二元人物？”她委婉地征询我。
    我想了一想：“秋白是一个坚强的共产主义战士，但他至死还为潜伏的绅士阶级知识分子的意识和感情没有克服而遗憾。正因为这样，在严酷的斗争中有时会是脆弱的。至于有人说到秋白的所谓‘双重人格’或‘心理裂变’等，我以为是不符秋白其人的。”
    她似乎赞同地说：“那是一种坚强中的脆弱，积极中的消极……”
    秋白故居给李又宁留下了深刻印象。她在美国曾想象过秋白住在祠堂里的情形，如今目睹当年景象，她才知道了残酷的现实怎样刺伤了一个少年人的心灵。她说：“为什么‘寂寞’一词在秋白诗文中屡屡出现？从这里也可以找到一部分答案吧。”
    在参观时，我对李又宁说：“我喜欢那一张照片：‘秋白与之华1928年在黑海边’，之华依偎在秋白怀里，秋白俯首对之华说着什么，……”李又宁却指着另一张：“我更喜欢那一幅画：那是秋白的速写稿，小独伊在哭，远处秋白在滑雪，角上写着：‘独伊你为什么要哭？爸爸要滑雪了’。”
    李又宁问我：“你写《秋之白华》电影剧本，一定可以从这照片和画页中获得了灵感吧？”她还说：已经买了电视剧《秋白之死》录像带，回美国可以放映给家人和朋友们看啦。她热望从屏幕上发现她想象中的秋白。
    我这时不禁脱口而出：“你应当是文学家，而不是史学家。”
    她笑了起来：“文学家应有历史的头脑，史学家也应有文学的想象力啊！”
    分别时，朋友们来送行，她一一握别说：“欢迎到纽约来作客，从来同行不是冤家。”
      现在，李又宁已飞渡重洋，回到她安谧的书室，也许正在与秋白进行心灵的对话吧！但她临别留下的语言：“没有不散的筵席，‘江南春’的金秋是令人难忘的。”仿佛还在我的耳边响着……
