	Rapidly Developing Education in Zaire
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Shangyang

	Zaire is a country in Central Africa with a population of 35 million. Among the high-ranking officials of the party, government, and military, many are university graduates or professors. The ranks of intellectuals are quite substantial, and some have become renowned scientists, writers, artists, inventors, or outstanding journalists both domestically and internationally. How did Zaire achieve this? The answer lies in the fact that Zaire's education sector has developed rapidly and has distinct national characteristics.

	Like other African countries, Zaire's education was very backward during the colonial period. At the time of independence in 1960, the national school enrollment rate was only 10%, with only a few high schools and one university. The country had only three native university teachers, 200 university students, and a total of only 10 university graduates. However, today's Zaire has an enrollment rate of 76% among its 6 million school-age children. The country has 5,284 public primary schools, and together with numerous private primary schools, there are nearly 5 million primary school students. There are 1,985 secondary schools of various types, 38 public universities and colleges, and 104 private higher education institutions. Since independence, Zaire has trained over 70,000 university-level talents on its own. At the same time, adult literacy education has also achieved remarkable results. At the time of independence, Zaire was basically a country of illiterates, but now the illiteracy rate has dropped to 30%.

	The rapid development of Zaire's education sector is primarily the result of the government's emphasis on education. From the party platform of the People's Revolutionary Movement to the national constitution, education is given a prominent position. In recent years, the proportion of education expenditures in the national budget has reached 14% to 27% annually. Secondly, Zaire has diverse forms of education. Zaire not only has public schools but also private schools and church-run schools funded by religious organizations. Additionally, actively promoting bilateral or multilateral educational cooperation has also driven the development of education.

	In developing its education sector, Zaire has also carried out several educational reforms, gradually improving its educational system, and forming two characteristics: First, the national character of education. Zaire stipulates that the purpose of education is to "enhance the national responsibility and moral character of Zaire citizens and develop the intelligence, physical strength, and vocational skills of Zaire citizens." Therefore, Zaire's schools particularly emphasize patriotism, political ideology, and moral character education. Starting from primary school, schools have courses in politics, morality, and African traditions; in universities, there are youth organizations of the Zaire People's Revolutionary Movement, which hold political ideology discussions and ideological lectures for university students. Second, the practicality of education. Zaire particularly emphasizes secondary vocational and technical education, establishing many three-to-five-year vocational schools and six-year technical schools. Agriculture is in a priority position in Zaire's economic development, and education is in a priority position in Zaire's social development. Therefore, among Zaire's 38 public higher education institutions, seven are agricultural colleges, and 14 are teacher training colleges, spread across all provinces. Currently, the Zaire government is taking rectification measures and is determined to achieve universal primary education and eliminate illiteracy nationwide by the year 2000.

    发展迅速的扎伊尔教育
    新华社记者　刘上阳
    扎伊尔是非洲中部拥有三千五百万人口的大国。在党、政、军高级官员中，许多人是大学毕业生或教授。知识分子的队伍相当庞大，其中有些人已成为闻名国内外的科学家、文学家、艺术家、发明家或出色的新闻工作者。扎伊尔是如何做到这一点的呢？答案是，扎伊尔的教育事业发展迅速，而且具有鲜明的民族特色。
    如同其他非洲国家一样，殖民时期的扎伊尔，教育事业十分落后。一九六○年独立时，全国儿童入学率只有百分之十，仅有几所中学和一所大学，本国大学教师只有三名，在校大学生才二百名，而全部大学毕业生仅有十名。然而，今天的扎伊尔，全国六百万学龄儿童中，入学率达到了百分之七十六，全国有公立小学共五千二百八十四所，加上众多的私立小学，小学生接近五百万；全国各类中学共有一千九百八十五所，公立大学和学院已有三十八所，私立高等院校一百零四所。自独立至今，扎伊尔已自己培养出各类大学人才七万多人。与此同时，成人扫盲教育也成绩显著，扎独立时基本上是一个文盲国，如今文盲率已下降到百分之三十。
    扎伊尔教育事业发展迅速，首先是政府重视教育的结果。从扎执政党人民革命运动的党纲到国家宪法都把国家教育放在重要地位。教育经费近年来在国家总预算中占的比例每年达到百分之十四至百分之二十七。其次是扎伊尔办学形式多样。扎不仅有公立学校，也有私立学校和由教会出资开办的教会学校。另外，大力开展双边或多边教育合作，也推动了教育发展。
    扎在发展教育事业中，还进行了多次教育改革，逐步完善了自己的教育体制，形成了两个特点：一是教育的民族性。扎规定教育的目的是“提高扎伊尔公民的国民责任心和道德品质，发展扎伊尔公民的智力、体力和职业技能”。因此，扎伊尔的学校特别重视爱国主义、政治思想和道德品质教育。从小学开始，学校就设有政治、品德、非洲传统课；在大学有扎党人民革命运动的青年组织，为大学生举办政治思想讨论会和意识形态讲座等。二是教育的实用性。扎特别重视中等职业技术教育，大量开设三—五年制的中等职业学校和六年制的中等技术学校。农业在扎经济发展中处于优先地位，教育在扎社会发展中处于优先地位，因而在扎三十八所公立高等院校中，农业院校占了七所，师范院校占了十四所，遍布全国各省。目前，扎政府正采取整顿措施，决心在二○○○年在全国普及小学教育和消灭文盲。　（本报有删节）
