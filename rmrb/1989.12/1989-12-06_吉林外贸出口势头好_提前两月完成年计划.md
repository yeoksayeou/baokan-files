Jilin's Foreign Trade Exports Show Strong Momentum, Completing Annual Plan Two Months Ahead

Our reporter Li Anda reports from Changchun: In the reform of its foreign trade system, Jilin Province has insisted on centralized and unified efforts to face the outside world, while emphasizing contract adherence and credibility, continuously developing a favorable situation for foreign trade exports. By the end of October, the province had exceeded its annual foreign exchange earnings target by 11%.

In recent years, in addition to the original nine state-owned specialized companies, Jilin Province has established several new foreign trade windows with the approval of relevant departments. For these newly established windows, the policy of "unified policy, equal competition, and appropriate support" has been adopted, actively providing assistance. For the original state-owned specialized companies, full use has been made of their advantages, such as having many old international customers, relatively stable sources of goods, and experienced personnel. In actual operations, each company, according to the national plan and unified arrangements within the province, strictly follows professional division of labor to purchase products for export, avoiding the chaotic situation of competitive dumping, and forming a unified front against the outside world.

Adhering to contracts and maintaining credibility are important means for Jilin Province's foreign trade system to continuously expand its international market. For many years, they have adhered to the contract approval system, ensuring that contracts without guarantees are not signed. For the quality of exported goods, they have strictly controlled the quality. The production factories and workshops of exported goods throughout the province are supervised by foreign trade companies to ensure product quality. Goods are checked for quality before being packed and handed over, and upon arrival at customs, they are inspected by opening the boxes. If quality problems are found, they are dealt with on the spot. In the past two years, the province's export trade contract fulfillment rate has been above 82%, with no major quality accidents or contract breaches and compensation incidents.

    吉林外贸出口势头好  提前两月完成年计划
    本报长春12月5日电　记者李安达报道：吉林省在外贸体制改革中，坚持集中统一，共同对外的同时，重合同，守信誉，不断发展外贸出口的大好形势。到10月底，已超额11％完成全年出口创汇计划。
    近年来，吉林省在外贸体制改革中，除了原有的9个国营专业公司外，又经有关部门批准成立了一些新的对外窗口。对新成立的窗口，采取“统一政策，平等竞争，适当照顾”的政策，积极给予扶持；对原有国营专业公司，充分发挥其国际市场老客户多，货源较稳定，有经营人才等优势。在具体经营中，各公司根据国家计划和省内统一安排，严格按照专业分工收购产品对外出口，避免了竞相倾销的混乱现象，形成了一致对外的“拳头”。
    重合同，守信誉，是吉林省外贸系统不断扩大国际市场的重要手段。多年来他们坚持合同审批制度，做到没有把握的合同不签。对出口商品质量，他们严格把关。全省出口商品的生产厂和车间，外贸公司都派员监督产品质量，做到商品装箱交货有质量检查，货到海关要开箱检查，发现质量问题，就地处理。近两年，全省出口贸易履约率都在82％以上，没有发生重大质量事故和毁约索赔事故。
