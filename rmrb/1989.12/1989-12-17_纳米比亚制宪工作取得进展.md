Namibia's Constitutional Assembly Standing Committee has agreed to use the constitution drafted by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as the basis for drafting the country's independence constitution.

According to the Namibia News Agency, citing _Today's Namibia_, the Standing Committee has agreed to adopt a proportional representation system for future elections, to use English as the official language, and to establish Namibia as a single secular state.

The Namibia News Agency said that representatives of various parties participating in the parliament are currently discussing the distribution of powers among the main government institutions. There are indications that all parties do not want to delay Namibia's independence any further, so it is possible that an agreement on the constitutional issue will be reached as soon as possible.

SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma expressed his optimism about the rapid completion of the constitutional drafting work and the achievement of independence in the first quarter of next year.

    纳米比亚制宪工作取得进展
    本报哈拉雷12月16日电  记者李景卫报道：纳米比亚制宪议会常务委员会同意以西南非洲人民组织提出的宪法草案为基础制订国家独立宪法。
    据纳米比亚新闻协会援引《今日纳米比亚》消息报道，常务委员会同意以比例代表制作为今后的选举制度，以英语作为官方语言以及把纳米比亚建成单一的世俗国家。
    纳米比亚新闻协会说，参加议会的各党派的代表正在就政府主要机构的权力分配问题进行酝酿。有迹象表明，各党派都不希望纳米比亚的独立再推迟，所以有可能在制宪问题上尽早达成协议。
    西南非洲人民组织领导人努乔马表示，他对迅速完成宪法起草工作并在明年第一季度实现独立持乐观态度。
