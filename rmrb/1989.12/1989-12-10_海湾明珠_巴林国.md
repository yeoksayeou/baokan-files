In the heart of the Gulf, there is a small island nation that often goes unnoticed on world maps, with an area of just over 600 square kilometers and a population of approximately 420,000. This is Bahrain, a country that recently established diplomatic relations with China. Bahrain is known as the "Land of a Thousand Islands," comprising 33 large and small islands. From an airplane, the Bahrain archipelago appears like a scattering of pearls of varying sizes, shimmering in the azure waves of the ocean, dazzling to the eye.

The capital of Bahrain, Manama, is located on the largest island, Bahrain Island. It serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. The city is filled with towering skyscrapers, and the wide, clean streets are lined with palm trees. Parks of various shapes and sizes can be found throughout the city, adorned with a variety of tropical plants, some lush and green, others fragrant and blooming, presenting a vibrant tropical landscape. The entire city exudes a sense of tranquility and peace.

On the outskirts of the city, along the highway, a few memorials stand out in particular: one is the "Pearl" Memorial Tower, with six pillars supporting a giant "pearl." At night, under the glow of multicolored lights, this symbol of Bahrain radiates an enchanting light. Another is the "Maritime" Memorial. On either side, there are two massive sails, with a large pearl in the middle, symbolizing the hardworking Bahraini people's past prosperity in the pearl industry. According to Bahraini friends, about 60 to 70 years ago, Bahrain was just a barren island with a population of only a few thousand. The ancestors of Bahrain relied on the sea for their livelihood, making a living by diving for pearls and fishing. Bahrain's pearls were once renowned worldwide. It was not until the discovery of oil in the 1930s that Bahrain underwent a dramatic transformation.

The Bahraini government erected these memorials to remind future generations not to forget the past and to build a modern Bahrain with the spirit of hard work and bravery of their ancestors.

    海湾明珠
    巴林国
    黄建明
    在海湾的中部，有一个在世界地图上不为人们注意的小岛国，面积只有600多平方公里，人口约42万。它就是同我国建交不久的巴林国。巴林被称之为“多岛之国”，由33个大小岛屿组成，从飞机上凭窗鸟瞰，巴林群岛犹如散落的一把大小不等的珍珠，在碧波荡漾的大洋里银光闪闪，光彩夺目。
    位于巴林国最大的岛屿——巴林岛上的麦纳麦是该国的首都，是巴林政治、经济和文化中心。市内的高楼大厦鳞次栉比，宽敞整洁的马路两旁椰树林立，形状各异的街心公园到处可见，各种热带植物有的翠绿欲滴，有的芬芳吐艳，呈现一派热带风光。整个城市给人以宁静安谧的感觉。
    在城市边缘的高速公路旁，有几座纪念碑尤其引人注目：一座是“珍珠”纪念塔，高达几十米的六根柱子托起一颗“大珍珠”，每当入夜，在各色灯光的照射下，象征巴林的这颗“大珍珠”放射出奇异的光彩。另一座是“航海”纪念碑。两边各一块巨大的风帆，中间夹着一颗大珠，象征勤劳的巴林人民过去采珠业的发达。据巴林朋友介绍，在六七十年前，巴林还仅仅是个只有几万人口的荒岛。巴林人的祖先“靠海吃海”，以采珠捕鱼为生。巴林的珍珠曾在世界上享有盛誉。直到30年代发现石油之后，巴林才发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    巴林政府建起这些纪念碑的目的就是要教育后代不要忘记过去，要以祖先勤劳勇敢的精神来建设现代化的巴林。
