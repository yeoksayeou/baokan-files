Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, December 11th.

Thai Foreign Ministry Counselor Vilapohn Sarasin today said here, “Thailand insists on a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue, with the ultimate goal of making Cambodia an independent, neutral country where the Cambodian people can exercise self-determination.”

Ambassador Sarasin was speaking on behalf of Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila, who was meeting with a visiting Chinese news delegation at the Thai Foreign Ministry. He said, “Vietnam invaded and occupied Cambodia, and in the end, Vietnam had to announce its withdrawal from Cambodia, acknowledging the need for a political solution to the Cambodian issue.”

He pointed out that the Cambodian issue, if left unresolved, would affect cooperation among the countries in the region. “The countries in this region have already suffered enough from war, and we should not let this situation continue.”

He is confident that in the future, China and Thailand will continue to actively cooperate in resolving the Cambodian issue.

Sarasin expressed his appreciation for the constructive role played by the Chinese media in promoting relations between the two countries. He said, the development of Sino-Thai relations is inseparable from the efforts of the media in both countries.

    泰国外交部官员说
    泰坚持全面政治解决柬问题
    据新华社曼谷12月11日电  泰国外交部驻部大使维拉蓬·沙拉信今天在这里说，“泰国坚持的是对柬埔寨问题实行全面政治解决，其最终目的是要使柬埔寨成为一个独立、中立和柬埔寨人民实行自决的国家”。
    沙拉信大使是受西提·沙卫西拉外长的委托今天在泰国外交部会见正在这里访问的中国新闻代表团时阐述泰国的这一原则立场的。他说，“越南出兵侵占柬埔寨，最后越南不得不宣布从柬埔寨撤军，承认对柬埔寨问题实行政治解决这一事实。”
    他指出，柬埔寨问题不解决，本地区国家之间的合作也会受到影响。“这一地区的国家已经饱尝了战争之苦，我们不应该让这种状况继续下去”。
    他深信，今后在解决柬埔寨问题上中泰双方将会继续积极合作。
    沙拉信对中国新闻界在促进两国关系方面发挥的建设性作用表示赞赏。他说，中泰两国关系的发展与两国新闻界的努力是分不开的。
