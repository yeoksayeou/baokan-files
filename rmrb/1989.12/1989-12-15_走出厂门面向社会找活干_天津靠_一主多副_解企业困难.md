People's Daily, Tianjin, December 14th.

Currently, some enterprises are facing operational difficulties. The Tianjin municipal government has proposed the "one main, multiple supplementary" approach. This means that all industries in the city should focus on their main business while also exploring various avenues to engage in multiple types of operations. Statistics show that, so far, the city's industrial, transportation, construction, and commercial systems have established 3,382 independent accounting enterprises for multiple types of operations, providing jobs for over 70,000 surplus workers and achieving a production value of nearly 2 billion yuan.

The municipal government requires all enterprises to fully utilize their own advantages, leverage their strengths, avoid weaknesses, and choose appropriate projects for multiple types of operations. They should make full use of idle factory buildings, equipment, and surplus workers to conduct deep processing and comprehensive development of small commodities that are popular among the masses and other labor-intensive projects using leftover materials.

The Tianjin municipal government requires large factories and stores to set aside their pride, step out of their gates, and actively seek work in society. At the same time, it clearly stipulates that enterprises cannot use the pretext of multiple types of operations to transfer the main factory's profits or use multiple types of operations as a small treasury for the main factory to distribute money and goods indiscriminately. They cannot use the pretext of multiple types of operations to engage in pure commercial wholesale activities, nor can they engage in buying and selling for profit.

    走出厂门面向社会找活干
    天津靠“一主多副”解企业困难
    本报天津12月14日电　记者梁小琴报道：当前一些企业在经营困难的情况下，天津市政府提出“一主多副”的办法，即全市各行各业在搞好主业的前提下，广开门路，大力开展多种经营。据统计，到目前为止，全市工、交、建、商系统已新办独立核算的多种经营企业3382个，安置富余职工7万多人，实现产值近20亿元。
    市政府要求各企业充分发挥自身优势，扬长避短，选准多种经营项目，充分利用闲置的厂房、设备及富余职工，用边角余料进行深加工和综合开发群众欢迎的小商品等劳动密集型项目。
    天津市政府要求大厂、大店放下架子，走出厂门、店门，面向社会主动找活干。同时明确提出企业不能打着多种经营的牌子转移主厂利润或将多种经营作为主厂小金库，滥发钱物；不能打着多种经营的牌子进行纯商业性的批发活动，更不能倒买倒卖。
