Panama Election Court Announces Endara as Elected President

		The People's Daily, Mexico City, December 27th - Reporter Guo Weicheng reports: The Panama Election Court today announced Endara as the elected president of the May 7th general election.

		On May 7th of this year, Panama held a general election. Noriega announced the election invalid when opposition leader Endara was leading in votes, with all votes not yet counted; the State Council then appointed Rodriguez as the interim president. At dawn on December 20th, after the U.S. military invaded Panama, Endara immediately declared himself president and officially took office on December 21st under the protection of the U.S. occupying forces. However, up to this point, the vast majority of Latin American countries do not recognize the Endara government.

		It is believed that Endara's announcement through the Panama Election Commission aims to give the government a "legal" form, thereby formally replacing the interim president Rodriguez. Currently, Rodriguez's whereabouts are still unknown. However, the U.S. occupying forces arrested Rodriguez's government's foreign minister, Leonardo Cam, today and sent him to the U.S. military base in the Canal Zone.

		According to reports, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Alonson today claimed that the United States would not allow Noriega to be extradited to any country other than the United States. President Bush also said he was not afraid of Noriega revealing CIA secrets during his trial. Noriega had long been employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The United States also requested that all countries freeze Noriega's deposits.

		According to reports, the Swiss government has frozen Noriega's deposits in banks in Geneva and Zurich.

    巴拿马选举法庭宣布
    恩达拉是大选的当选总统
    本报墨西哥城12月27日电　记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马选举法庭今天宣布恩达拉为今年5月7日大选的当选总统。
    今年5月7日巴拿马举行大选。诺列加在反对党领导人恩达拉得票领先、全部票数尚未计出的情况下宣布大选无效；由国务委员会任命罗德里格斯为临时总统。12月20日凌晨，在美军入侵巴拿马后，恩达拉立即宣布自己为总统，并于12月21日在美国占领军保护下正式就职。但是，迄今为止，绝大多数拉美国家都不承认恩达拉政府。
    据认为，恩达拉通过巴拿马选举委员会的上述宣布，旨在使政府取得“合法”形式，从而正式取代罗德里格斯临时总统。目前，罗德里格斯仍然下落不明。但是，美国占领军今天拘捕了罗德里格斯政府的外交部长莱奥纳多·卡姆，并解往运河区美军基地。
    另据报道，美国泛美事务助理国务卿阿隆松今天声称，美国不会让诺列加引渡到除美国外的任何国家。布什总统并说，他不怕诺列加在受审时揭露中央情报局的秘密。诺列加曾长期受雇于美国中央情报局。美国还要求各国银行冻结诺列加的存款。
    据报道，瑞士政府已冻结诺列加在日内瓦和苏黎世银行的存款。
