Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th.

On the eve of the New Year 1990, the capital's universities are adorned with lanterns and flowers, and students are bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new with a variety of vibrant activities.

Beijing University's "Sports and Culture Week" has just concluded. Various artistic performances, costume balls, and gala evenings have made the festive atmosphere even more pronounced. The school also held a unique "Dance Competition to Welcome the 1990s," which sparked great interest among university students. The Beijing University Art Troupe also left for Shijiazhuang on the 28th to visit over 700 freshmen of the class of 1989 who are undergoing military training there.

Before the New Year, the Graduate Student Union of Renmin University of China organized a series of lectures titled "Situation and Policy" by renowned professors, which have already been conducted more than ten times. Nearly ten thousand graduate and undergraduate students participated in this activity.

Beijing Normal University's recent "Embrace the 1990s" series of cultural activities have been warmly received by the entire student body. Poetry and calligraphy exhibitions, English intelligence competitions, essay contests titled "My University," and speech competitions titled "Reflections and Prospects on the 1990s" have attracted a large number of students. In the school-wide singing competition, which included students from 13 departments, songs such as "Ode to Joy," "Graduation Song," and "We Are on the Taihang Mountains" inspired and motivated the participants.

Students at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics have shown great enthusiasm for voluntary labor. In the school cafeteria, one can often see students helping with cooking and cleaning. It is understood that this semester, over 3,000 students from Beihang have participated in voluntary labor. Not long ago, the school allocated 200 spots for students to participate in voluntary labor at the Asian Games construction site, but in reality, over 400 students eagerly volunteered for this honorable labor.

In recent days, students at Beijing Medical University seem particularly excited. In activities themed "Patriotism, Vigor, Health, and Vivacity," over 2,000 students and teachers participated in the "Everyone Exercises to Welcome the Asian Games" long-distance running event. Activities organized by the school's Student Union Psychology Enthusiasts Association, such as discussions with psychologists, have also resonated greatly among university students.

    张灯结彩辞旧岁　满怀信心迎新年
    首都大学生节日活动丰富
    新华社北京12月30日电（记者江钱峰）1990年元旦前夕，首都各高校张灯结彩，大学生们以丰富多采的活动辞旧迎新。
    北京大学学生“体育文化周”刚刚结束，各种文艺汇演、化装舞会、联欢晚会等丰富多采的校园活动使节日的气氛越来越浓。学校还举办了别开生面的“迎接90年代舞蹈大奖赛”，引起了大学生浓厚的兴趣。北大艺术团也已于28日赶赴石家庄，慰问在那里参加军训的700多名89级新生。
    新年前，中国人民大学研究生会组织著名教授主讲的大型系列讲座“形势与政策”，已开办了十余讲，近万人次的研究生、本科生参加了这项活动。
    北京师范大学近期开始的“拥抱九十年代”系列文化活动受到了全校学生的热烈欢迎。诗作、书法展览，英语智力竞赛，“我的大学”征文竞赛，“面对90年代的回顾与展望”演讲比赛吸引了大批学生。在由13个系的学生参加的全校歌咏大赛上，《欢乐颂》、《毕业歌》、《我们在太行山上》等中外名曲振奋人心，催人奋进。
    北京航空航天大学的学生参加义务劳动的热情很高，学校的食堂里经常可以看到一些大学生在帮厨、打扫卫生。据了解，这学期来，北航参加义务劳动的学生已达3000多人次。前不久，学校分配到200个参加亚运会工地劳动的名额，但实际上有400多名学生争先恐后地参加了这项光荣的义务劳动。
    这几天，北京医科大学的学生们似乎格外兴奋，在主题为“爱国、振奋、健康、活泼”的活动中，2000余名学生、教师参加了“人人锻炼迎亚运”的长跑活动。由校学生会心理爱好者协会组织的与心理学家座谈等活动也在大学生中得到了较大的反响。
