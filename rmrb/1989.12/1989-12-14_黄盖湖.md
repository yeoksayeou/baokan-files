Lake Huang Gai is located on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, at the border between Linxiang County in Hunan Province and Pucheng County in Hubei Province. The lake's waters span across both Hunan and Hubei provinces, covering an area of approximately seventy square kilometers. To the northwest, it connects with the Yangtze River. Within the lake, the waters are clear and sparkling, with waves gently rippling; fish swim freely like arrows. On the shore, green trees provide ample shade, their reflections clearly visible in the lake. During nights with a full moon or at sunset, the sunlight and moonlight reflect off the lake's surface, creating a scene of poetic beauty.

According to historical records, during the Three Kingdoms period, Lake Huang Gai was much larger than it is today. The vast lake shores were covered with reeds, making it an ideal place for military training. From Lake Huang Gai, one can travel by boat upstream for about ten li (approximately five kilometers) to reach the ancient battlefield of Chibi. In the year 207 AD, Cao Cao led his army southward and engaged in a fierce battle with the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei at Chibi.

When Cao Cao's army reached the northern bank of the river, Sun Quan and Zhou Yu recognized the weakness of Cao Cao's troops in naval warfare. To enhance the combat capabilities of the Eastern Wu navy, they appointed the famous general Huang Gai to train the troops at this lake.

Huang Gai contributed significantly to the victory of the Battle of Chibi for Wu and Shu, earning the praise of Sun Quan. In honor of Huang Gai's pre-battle training of the troops in this lake, Sun Quan named it Lake Huang Gai.

Today, Lake Huang Gai has become a beautiful and prosperous land of fish and rice, as well as a famous tourist destination, attracting tens of thousands of domestic and international visitors.

    黄盖湖

    黄盖湖，位于长江南岸，湖南省临湘县与湖北省蒲圻县交界处。水域跨越湘鄂两省，面积大约为七十多平方公里。西北通长江。湖中，碧波晶莹，荡漾多姿，鱼翔如梭；岸上，绿树成荫，清晰地倒映在湖中；每当月色溶溶之夜，或者红日西沉之际，日光、月光映照在湖面，富有诗情画意。
    据历史记载，“三国”时的黄盖湖，面积比现在要大得多。辽阔的湖滩上，尽是芦苇，可谓得天独厚的练兵之地。从黄盖湖乘船沿江而上十几里，即到赤壁古战场。公元二百零七年，曹操率军南下，与孙权、刘备联军鏖战于赤壁。
    当曹军到达江北后，孙权、周瑜看到曹兵不习水战之弱点，为提高东吴水兵之水战能力，便启用东吴名将黄盖在此操练水兵。
    黄盖为吴蜀取得赤壁之战的胜利，立下了功勋，受到了孙权的嘉奖，并把黄盖战前操练水兵的湖泊，命名为黄盖湖。
    如今，黄盖湖已变成美丽富饶的鱼米之乡和著名的旅游胜地，吸引着成千上万的中外游客。
