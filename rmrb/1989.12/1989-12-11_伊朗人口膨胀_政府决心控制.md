Iran's population has reached 55 million, with a growth rate of 3.2 percent, said Jamshedi, head of the Iranian Statistics Center, in a recent interview with Tehran Radio. Jamshedi noted that the rapid population growth has severely impacted the country's economic development. The Iranian government has implemented family planning measures and imported a batch of contraceptives from abroad for the first time last December.

It is reported that Iran will cooperate with the United Nations Population Fund to complete a two-year family planning program. Iran invited the organization's executive director, Shadick, to visit Tehran earlier this month. It is understood that Shadick has promised to provide Iran with $4 million in aid to help implement the population control plan.

    伊朗人口膨胀　政府决心控制
    新华社德黑兰电　伊朗统计中心负责人贾姆希迪最近在接受德黑兰电台采访时说，伊朗人口已增长到5500万，增长率高达3.2％。
    贾姆希迪说，人口增长过猛使国民经济发展受到严重影响。伊朗政府已采取计划生育措施，去年12月首次从国外进口一批避孕药具。
    据透露，伊朗将同联合国人口活动基金会进行合作，完成一项计划生育的两年计划。伊朗本月初邀请该组织执行主任沙迪克访问德黑兰。据悉，沙迪克已保证向伊朗提供400万美元的援助，帮助伊朗完成人口控制计划。
