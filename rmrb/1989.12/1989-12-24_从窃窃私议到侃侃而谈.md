Title: From Whispering to Speaking Out
Author: Yu Qing
Date: 1989-12-24
Edition: 7

A book titled "Japan Should Speak Out" has been published in Japan. The book discusses U.S.-Japan relations but reflects the problems and contradictions between the two countries. Published at the beginning of this year, by December it had been reprinted nine times, with nearly 350,000 copies in circulation. U.S. Newsweek reported that the book has become a topic of discussion among high-ranking U.S. officials. The New York Times said that the book has become a must-read in Washington.

The book's title can be literally translated as "Japan Should Say 'No,'" but I have translated it as "Japan Should Speak Out." The subtitle is "New Strategies for U.S.-Japan Relations." One of the authors is Morita Akio, the chairman of the famous Japanese electronics company Sony. This year, Sony's acquisition of Hollywood became news; Morita has long resided in the U.S. and is known as an "expert on America." The other author is Ishihara Shintaro, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, originally a writer, and now a prominent figure in Japanese politics, known as the "next generation of leaders."

The book is about 80,000 words long and is compiled from discussions and speeches. It consists of 11 chapters, with Morita writing 6 and Ishihara writing 5. The content is broad, covering politics, economics, technology, diplomacy, and future strategies for the two countries' relations. In a sense, this book reflects, from one aspect, the contradictions between the U.S. and Japan and foreshadows the subtle changes occurring in the relationship between these two countries.

The book first discusses technology. Ishihara says that America's medium-range missiles, land-based missiles, and other high-tech weapons are computer-controlled. The semiconductors used in these computers are 100% supplied by Japan. Therefore, the heart of America's military strength is Japan's high technology. If Japan sells semiconductors to the Soviet Union and not to the U.S., the military balance will immediately change. Morita says that America's basic technological research is indeed advanced, and Japanese companies also make extensive use of American technology. Japan's industrial strength lies in turning new technologies into products, but America lacks the creativity to turn technology into products.

Regarding the American economy, Morita says that among the world's industrialized countries, only America does not have a Ministry of Industry. Americans have forgotten how to produce products and are instead obsessed with mergers and acquisitions and stock trading, focusing on making money from money. Problems in industry and the economy are becoming increasingly serious. The price of gasoline in America is about $1 per gallon, while in other countries it is mostly $4. America now has a high budget deficit. If the price of gasoline is taxed an additional 1 cent per gallon, the government can have $1 billion in tax revenue. If taxed an additional 10 cents, the government can increase revenue by $10 billion. But American politicians are concerned that increasing taxes will reduce votes. But without increasing taxes, how can the budget deficit be reduced? The dollar is gradually weakening, and when there is a lack of money, interest rates are raised to attract foreign investment. But in the future, interest must be paid, thus falling into an endless vicious cycle.

Regarding U.S.-Japan trade friction and American politicians "beating up on Japan," Morita shared a personal experience. He and an American who often expressed dissatisfaction with Japanese products flooding the U.S. market went golfing. Morita's golf clubs were American-made, while the American's clubs were Japanese-made. When visiting the American's home, the house was full of Japanese electronic products. Morita believes that blaming the trade imbalance entirely on Japan is unfair. Politicians are most concerned about votes; "beating up on Japan" can gain votes, while praising Japan will reduce votes. Ishihara says that the root of Americans "beating up on Japan" lies in American racial prejudice. This prejudice comes from a sense of superiority over their own culture.

Regarding the current state of U.S.-Japan relations and future strategies, Morita says that despite the constant friction between the U.S. and Japan, the two countries have an inseparable relationship and are interdependent. Both sides should strengthen coordination. The Japanese government has missed many opportunities to say "no" when it should have. For example, restricting the export of Japanese cars to the U.S. and trade friction negotiations. Unbeknownst to them, speaking out will deepen mutual understanding and is beneficial for solving problems. Ishihara says that when you should say "no," not daring to say "no" will instead lead to being looked down upon, further fueling the other party's racial prejudice. Japan has the strength but has not used it as a "card" in diplomacy. Japan should not yield to American intimidation and should not yield to external pressure in diplomacy.

Throughout the year, discussions surrounding this book have not ceased, sparking various reactions. U.S. Vice President Quayle said in a speech in late October that there are indeed prominent figures in the U.S. who indiscriminately "beat up on Japan." Similarly, there are people who advocate "beating up on the U.S." U.S. President Bush said on November 14 during a meeting with the outgoing Japanese ambassador to the U.S. that recently some people in the U.S. have criticized Japan, and some people in Japan have criticized the U.S., which does not represent the views of the majority. The governments of the two countries need to take decisive measures. On December 18, the latest opinion poll published by U.S. Business Week was shocked by the views of Japanese people on the U.S., believing that U.S.-Japan relations have entered an unstable era.

Surrounding this book, some American officials believe that the book indeed points out the problems in the U.S., with insightful criticism. Other American officials condemn it as "new nationalism," accusing Japanese people of becoming arrogant. Some Japanese people are concerned that it will add fuel to the fire of the economic friction between the U.S. and Japan. European public opinion believes that this book provides a rare reference for understanding the psychology of Japanese people who have always been ambiguous in language. In the past, Japanese people only whispered about their dissatisfaction with the U.S., but now they speak openly in public. The authors indeed speak for some Japanese people's true intentions. This shows that U.S.-Japan relations are undergoing subtle changes and will continue to change.

    从窃窃私议到侃侃而谈
    于青
    日本出版了一本名叫《日本应该直言不讳》的书。这本书谈的是日美关系，但反映出来的是两国之间的问题与矛盾。今年初出版发行，至12月已再版9次，发行近35万部。美国《新闻周刊》说，该书在美国高层人士中成为议论的话题。《纽约时报》说，这本书已成为华盛顿的必读书。
    此书名直译可为《应该说“不”的日本》，笔者译作《日本应该直言不讳》。副题是《新日美关系方策》。两位著者之一是日本著名电气企业索尼公司会长盛田昭夫。该公司今年兼并美国好莱坞成为新闻，盛田曾长期驻美，有“美国通”之称。另一著者是日本众议员石原慎太郎，原是作家，现在是日本政坛风云人物，被称为“次新一代领导人”。
    全书约8万字，根据讨论发言整理成书。共11章，盛田著6章，石原著5章，内容广泛，谈及日美两国的政治、经济、科技、外交及今后两国关系的对策。可以说，这本书从一个侧面反映了日美两国的矛盾，并预示着这两个国家正在发生的微妙关系。
    书中先提及科技方面。石原说，美国的中程导弹、陆基导弹等高技术武器是由电脑控制的。而电脑中使用的半导体100％是日本提供的。因此，支撑美国军事力量的心脏是日本的高技术。如果日本把半导体卖给苏联，不卖给美国，则立刻会改变军事力量的平衡。盛田说，美国的基础技术研究确实先进，日本企业也多利用美国技术。日本产业实力雄厚在于把新技术变成产品，但美国缺少把技术变成产品的创造力。
    关于美国经济。盛田说，世界上的工业发达国家中，没有工业部的仅是美国。美国人已忘记生产产品，而热衷于兼并企业和股票买卖，埋头于以钱赚钱，工业和经济方面出现的问题日趋严重。美国汽油售价是一加仑约1美元，其它国家大多是4美元。美国现在财政是高额赤字，如果每加仑汽油价加税1美分，政府可有10亿美元税收入。如果加税10美分，政府可增加100亿美元收入。但美国政治家顾虑的是，增加税收将减少选票。但不增税收，减少财政赤字从何谈起。美元逐渐疲软，缺钱就提高利率，吸引国外投资，但日后还要付利息，这样陷入无止境的恶性循环。
    谈到日美贸易摩擦和美国政治家“敲打日本”。盛田讲了一段亲身经历。他和一位常对日本商品充斥美国市场表示不满的美国人去打高尔夫球。盛田带的球杆是美国产品，那位美国人拿的球杆是日本产品。到那位美国人家作客，屋内尽是日本电器产品。盛田认为把贸易不平衡的责任全部推给日本是不公平的。政治家最关心选票，“敲打日本”可以获得选票，说日本好，选票就会减少。石原说，美国人“敲打日本”的根源在于美国人的种族偏见。这种偏见来自对本国文化的自负感。
    对于日美关系的现状和今后对策，盛田说，日美之间尽管摩擦不断，但两国有切不断的千丝万缕的联系，是相互依存的关系，双方应加强协调。日本政府失去很多该说“不”而不说“不”的机会，如限制日本汽车向美国出口，外贸摩擦谈判等。孰不知，直言不讳会加深相互理解，有利于解决问题。石原说，应该说“不”的时候，不敢说“不”，反而受到轻视，进而助长对方的种族偏见。日本有实力，但并未以此为“牌”在外交上运用。日本不应屈服于美国的恫吓，外交上不应屈服于外部压力。
    今年一年之内，围绕这本书的议论一直未曾停息，引起种种反响。美国副总统奎尔10月下旬在一次讲演中说，美国国内确有著名人士不加分别地“敲打日本”。与此相同，也有的人士主张“敲打美国”。美国总统布什11月14日在会见即将离任的日本驻美国大使时说，最近美国有人批评日本，日本也有人批评美国，这并不代表多数人的意见，日美两国政府有必要采取果断措施。12月18日美国《商业周刊》在最新发表的舆论调查中，对日本人的美国观感到震惊，认为日美关系进入不安定的时代。
      围绕这本书的议论，一些美国人士认为，书中确实指出美国存在的弊端，不乏有洞察力的批评。另一些美国人士斥之为“新国粹主义”，指责日本人变得傲慢。部分日本人担心给处于经济摩擦中的日美关系火上浇油。欧洲舆论认为，这本书为人们了解一向语言暧昧的日本人的心理提供了难得的参照物。过去日本人只是窃窃私议对美国的不满，现今在大庭广众下侃侃而谈，著者的确道出了部分日本人的真意。这说明日美关系正在发生微妙的变化，并将继续发生变化。
