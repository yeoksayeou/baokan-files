Inner Mongolia Improves Pastoral Area Contract Responsibility System
Grasslands Implement Paid-Use System

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 17th

A recent report from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region indicates that the region is taking new measures to improve the pastoral area contract responsibility system. The decision has been made to gradually implement the paid-use system for grasslands across the entire pastoral region.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have universally reformed the old production and management system, implementing the "valuation and allocation of livestock to households, with households responsible for raising" and "division and contract use of grasslands" responsibility system. This has significantly promoted the development of productive forces. However, due to the lack of clarification of grassland usage rights, issues such as neglecting the carrying capacity of grasslands, blindly increasing livestock numbers, even overgrazing, excessive grazing, and exploitative management have emerged. The speed of grassland degradation has outpaced the speed of grassland construction.

Starting in 1982, Ar Horqin Banner, Barin Right Banner, and six other banners have successively conducted pilot programs for paid-use contracts and paid-use of grasslands. Within less than two years, the pilot banners have seen a surge in enthusiasm for grassland construction among thousands of households. The autonomous region has recognized from these pilot programs that establishing a paid-use contract system for grasslands is imperative.

The main approach of this reform, which the autonomous region has decided to promote, is as follows: delineate and define grassland boundaries, clarify usage rights; measure grass production and determine reasonable livestock carrying capacities; gradually achieve natural renewal and rotational grazing of grasslands; formulate reasonable charging standards and management systems; establish grassland transfer systems and management mechanisms primarily based on rewards and punishments; strengthen scientific and legal management of grasslands, etc.

The reporter observed in Dong Ujimqin Banner, Siziwang Banner, and Zhenglan Banner that a wave of grassland construction is already underway. Vice Chairman Alatan Oqir told the reporter that if this reform is fully implemented, the region can collect approximately 400 million to 500 million yuan in construction funds annually. This money will be retained at the sum level, "taken from the grass and used for the grass," to establish a fund for the development of animal husbandry, which no one is allowed to adjust or misappropriate.

### 内蒙古完善牧区联产承包制  草牧场推行有偿使用制

    内蒙古完善牧区联产承包制
    草牧场推行有偿使用制
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：内蒙古自治区最近推出完善牧区联产承包责任制的新措施，决定在全区牧区逐渐推开落实草牧场使用权，实行草牧场有偿承包使用制度。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，内蒙古牧区普遍改革了旧的生产经营体制，实行牲畜“作价归户，户有户养”和草牧场
  “划片承包使用”的责任制，有力地促进了生产力的发展。但由于草牧场使用权不落实，出现了忽视草牧场载畜能力，盲目发展牲畜头数，甚至抢牧、滥牧、掠夺式经营，草牧场建设速度赶不上退化速度等问题。
    从1982年开始，阿鲁科尔沁旗、巴林右旗等8个旗先后开展了草场有偿承包有偿使用的试点，不到两年，试点旗都出现了千家万户建设草原积极性高涨的新局面。自治区从试点中认识到，建立草牧场有偿承包使用制度，势在必行。
    自治区决定推开的这一改革的主要做法是：划分划定草牧场边界，落实使用权；测定产草量，核定合理的载畜量；逐步实现草牧场的自然更新和划区轮牧；制定合理的收费标准和管理制度；建立草牧场转让制度和以奖罚为主要形式的管理机制；加强草牧场的科学化法制化管理等。
    记者在东乌珠穆沁旗、四子王旗、正蓝旗等地看到，建设草场的热潮已在兴起。自治区副主席阿拉坦敖其尔告诉记者，这一项改革如全面推开，全区一年大致可收取4000—5000万元的建设资金，而这笔钱全留在嘎查（村）一级，“取之于草用之于草”，建立畜牧业发展基金，任何人不得平调或挪用。
