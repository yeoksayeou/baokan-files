The five presidents of Central America concluded three days of intense discussions and signed the "Coronado Declaration" early this morning. This meeting was held at a critical juncture when the situation in Central America had deteriorated severely and the peace process faced a stern test. Due to a disagreement between Nicaragua and Honduras over the sequence of withdrawing the Nicaraguan anti-government forces currently stationed in Honduras and Nicaragua's withdrawal of its lawsuit against Honduras at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Honduran President Azcona temporarily withdrew from the meeting, causing the meeting to face a serious setback. After fierce debates and negotiations, the five presidents finally signed the "Coronado Declaration."

The main agenda of this special summit of the five Central American presidents was the internal conflict in El Salvador and the withdrawal of Nicaraguan anti-government forces, as well as promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between El Salvador and Nicaragua. In fact, apart from the five presidents sitting together and reaching some agreements, this meeting did not achieve any significant results. Compared to others, El Salvador's President Cristiani was quite satisfied with the outcome of the meeting. Because the Salvadoran government's demand to make non-state armed groups in the region illegal was supported by the other presidents attending the meeting. At the five-country summit in Tegucigalpa in August, President Cristiani proposed the simultaneous withdrawal of Nicaraguan anti-government forces and Salvadoran guerrillas, which became a focal point of disagreement at the time. However, the other four countries considered these to be two different issues and did not agree with the Salvadoran government's position. Nevertheless, this joint declaration not only condemned the "terrorist actions" of the Salvadoran guerrillas but also required the "International Support and Verification Commission" to take action to withdraw the Salvadoran guerrillas. This outcome even exceeded the expectations of the Salvadoran government. In exchange, including El Salvador, the other four countries supported Nicaragua's demand to withdraw the Nicaraguan anti-government forces. However, in the joint declaration, the wording on this point was far less emphatic than the stance on the Salvadoran issue. According to the Tegucigalpa agreement, the Nicaraguan anti-government forces were to begin withdrawal on December 5 of this year. The Nicaraguan government stated before this meeting that it could postpone the withdrawal to December 31. However, this meeting's declaration neither reaffirmed the validity of the Tegucigalpa declaration nor required the Honduran government to assume any obligations, which was a step back from the Tegucigalpa declaration.

This situation arose because the United States, since the Tegucigalpa meeting, has been working to push for the withdrawal of Nicaraguan anti-government forces to be postponed until after the Nicaraguan elections on February 25 next year. However, this joint declaration did not even specify a date for the withdrawal, effectively putting this issue on hold indefinitely. Moreover, as long as the Nicaraguan opposition does not win the February 25 elections next year, the anti-government forces will not be withdrawn. Similarly, if even the Nicaraguan anti-government forces residing abroad cannot be withdrawn, how can a powerful guerrilla force rooted in El Salvador be withdrawn? It can be said that the "Coronado Declaration" by the five presidents, apart from giving the Salvadoran government a slight political and diplomatic advantage, will have no effect on resolving the internal conflict in El Salvador. Instead, it may exacerbate the current hardline stance of the Salvadoran government against the guerrillas, making the guerrillas refuse to negotiate under domestic and international pressure. The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front immediately issued a statement condemning the joint declaration of the five presidents, which is a clear signal.

In summary, this summit of the five Central American presidents will have no impact on the situation in the region and will not help in resolving the issues in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The future of the peace process in Central America remains uncertain.

    悬而未决的首脑会议
    本报记者　郭伟成
    中美洲5国总统经过3天特别会议的紧张讨论，终于在今天凌晨签署了《科罗纳多声明》。这次会议是在中美洲局势严重恶化、和平进程面临严峻考验的时刻召开的。由于尼加拉瓜与洪都拉斯在遣散目前驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的尼加拉瓜反政府武装及尼加拉瓜撤回在海牙国际法庭对洪都拉斯起诉这两个问题孰先孰后上发生分歧，洪都拉斯总统阿斯科纳一度退出会议，使会议面临严重挫折。后经过激烈争论与讨价还价，5国总统才最后签署了《科罗纳多声明》。
    这次中美洲5国首脑特别会议主要讨论的是萨尔瓦多内战局势及遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装问题，以及促使萨尔瓦多与尼加拉瓜恢复外交关系。事实上，除了5国总统坐在一起开会并取得某些协议外，这次会议没有取得什么重要成果。比较来说，萨尔瓦多克里斯蒂亚尼总统对会议成果甚感满意。因为萨政府要求使本地区非正式武装非合法化的立场得到了与会其他总统的支持。在今年8月5国首脑的特拉会议上，克里斯蒂亚尼总统就提出对尼加拉瓜反政府武装及萨尔瓦多游击队同时予以遣散，成为当时会议分歧的一个焦点。但是，其他4国认为这是两种不同的事情而不同意萨政府的这一立场。然而，这次5国联合声明不但谴责萨尔瓦多游击队的“恐怖行动”，还要求“国际支持与核查委员会”采取行动遣散萨游击队。这一结局，甚至大大超出了萨政府的期望。作为交换，包括萨尔瓦多在内的另外4国支持尼加拉瓜要求遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装的立场。然而，在联合声明中，关于这一要点的措词远远不如对萨尔瓦多问题的表态。根据特拉会议协议，尼加拉瓜反政府武装应于今年12月5日开始执行遣散，尼加拉瓜政府在这次会前表示，可以推迟到12月31日执行遣散。但是这次会议的声明，既不重申特拉声明的有效性，也没有要求洪都拉斯政府承担义务，这是从特拉声明的后退。
    出现这一局面的原因是美国从特拉会议以来就一直做工作，要求中美洲其他国家把对尼加拉瓜反政府武装的遣散推迟到明年2月25日尼加拉瓜大选以后执行。然而这次联合声明连遣散日期都未规定，实际上使这个问题无限期搁浅。而且，只要尼加拉瓜反对派在明年2月25日大选中不获胜，反政府武装是不会遣散回国的。同样，如果连寄居国外的尼加拉瓜反政府武装都遣散不了，又怎能去遣散一支扎根在萨尔瓦多国内的强大的游击队呢？可以说，5国首脑的《科罗纳多声明》除了使萨尔瓦多政府在政治上及外交上略有得分外，对于解决萨尔瓦多内战根本起不了什么作用，反而会由于助长萨政府目前对游击队的强硬立场而使游击队拒绝在国内外高压下进行谈判。法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线今天立即发表声明谴责5国总统联合声明，就是一个明显的信号。
    总之，这次中美洲5国首脑会议不会对本地区形势产生什么影响，也不会有助于萨尔瓦多与尼加拉瓜问题的圆满解决。中美洲和平进程的前途仍未可乐观。（本报墨西哥城电）
