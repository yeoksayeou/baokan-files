	China's steel production has surpassed 60 million tons, making it the fourth country in the world to achieve this milestone. The target was reached 12 days ahead of schedule, with a total production of 60.1 million tons. Other economic indicators have also been successfully met.

	An official from the Ministry of Metallurgy stated that currently, the countries with steel production exceeding 60 million tons are the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, and China. The time taken by these countries to increase their steel production from 30 million tons to 60 million tons varies: the United States took 28 years, the Soviet Union took 9 years, and China took 11 years, demonstrating a relatively rapid development.

	Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's steel production has increased by an average of 2.6 million tons per year. Over the past 11 years, the national steel production has doubled.

	In the first half of this year, due to issues with coal, electricity, and transportation, the steel production in the first quarter decreased by 10 million tons compared to the same period last year, a reduction of 6.7%. In this challenging situation, the broad masses of metallurgical workers remained steadfast, maintained their posts, and did everything possible to ensure normal production. Steel production gradually improved. In April, the daily steel production reached 1.704 million tons, setting a new historical high. In May and June, production was affected by the unrest, causing a temporary decline. After the Fourth Plenary Session, the workers were even more spirited, seizing every minute to make up for the losses caused by the unrest. During the high-temperature months of July and August, steel workers broke conventional practices, achieving high production in high temperatures, with daily steel production reaching 1.822 million tons, setting a new historical high. This fact fully demonstrates that China's 3 million metallurgical workers are a formidable force. Currently, the workers are continuing to advance, striving to produce more high-quality steel for the country.

    我钢产量突破六千万吨
    成为世界第四个超六千万吨的钢铁大国
    本报北京12月24日讯　记者刘燮阳报道：今天，我国钢的产量已突破6000万吨大关，提前12天完成全年计划，达到6010万吨，成为世界上第4个钢产量超过6000万吨的钢铁大国。其它各项经济指标都完成得很好。
    冶金部负责人说，目前世界上超过6000万吨钢的国家只有苏联、日本、美国和中国。从3000万吨增长到6000万吨，美国用了28年，苏联用了9年，我国用了11年，发展速度是比较快的。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国钢产量平均每年增长260万吨以上，11年来，全国钢产量翻了一番。
    今年上半年，由于煤、电、运输的影响，一季度钢产量比去年同期减少100万吨，下降6.7％。在这种情况下，广大冶金战线职工临阵不乱，坚守岗位，千方百计维持正常生产，钢铁生产逐步好转。4月份，日产钢17.04万吨，创历史最好水平。5、6月份受动乱影响，钢产量一度下跌。四中全会以后，广大职工更是精神振奋，争分夺秒，决心夺回动乱造成的损失。在7—8月份高温季节，炼钢工人打破常规，高温夺高产，日产钢达18.22万吨，刷新历史最好水平。这一事实充分说明，我国300万冶金职工是一支过得硬的队伍。目前，广大职工正在乘胜前进，为国家多增好钢好铁。
