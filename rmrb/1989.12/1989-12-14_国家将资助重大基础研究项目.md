The State Council's Natural Science Foundation Committee recently decided that during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, the state will focus on funding 85 major basic research projects and has announced the requirements and procedures for project approval.

To continue ensuring that basic research focuses on key areas, the National Science Foundation has determined that the scale of major projects funded by the National Fund during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period will be roughly equivalent to that of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." At the same time, the Science Foundation has decided to solicit project proposals nationwide. All scientific and technological personnel across the country with the relevant capabilities can submit applications based on the announced requirements and procedures.
