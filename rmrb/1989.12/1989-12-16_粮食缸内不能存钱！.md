In Xixia Town of my county, villager Zhang Gengjian and his family worked hard and saved 1,800 yuan last year. Since they had no immediate use for the money, they stored it in a large jar that contained grain, thinking it would be safe and secure. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to them, rats managed to squeeze through the gaps in the jar's lid, not only eating some of the grain but also gnawing at the bundles of banknotes, tearing them to pieces.

In early October, when they needed to use the grain in the jar, the Zhang family discovered the damage. Afterwards, Zhang Gengjian sighed and told others, “A grain jar is definitely not a safe place to store money. It’s better to deposit money in the bank for security!”

    粮食缸内不能存钱！
    在我县西下町村里，村民张更俭一家人靠自己的勤劳，去年积攒了1800元钱。这笔钱一时没有花向，就存放在盛有粮食的大缸内，认为既安全又严密。谁知，不知什么时候，老鼠从缸盖的缝隙里钻了进去，不仅吃了一些粮食，而且还把成捆的人民币一点一点地咬碎。
    10月初，因为要用缸里的粮食，张家才发现。事后，张更俭叹息地对人们说：“粮食缸内真不是存钱的地方，有钱还是存到银行里保险啊！”
