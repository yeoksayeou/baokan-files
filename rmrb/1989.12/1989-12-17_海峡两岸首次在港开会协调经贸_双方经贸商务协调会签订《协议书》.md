Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 16th - The Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Coordination Committee and the Cross-Strait Business Coordination Committee held their first committee meeting today in Hong Kong, where both sides signed an "Agreement."

Recently, both the mainland and Taiwan established respective business coordination committees in Hong Kong. The Taiwanese side is named the "Cross-Strait Business Coordination Committee," with Zhang Pingzhao as the chairman and 35 members. The mainland side is named the "Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Coordination Committee," with Zheng Hongye as the chairman and 25 members. The members of both coordination committees are business and industry figures, experts, and scholars.

At today's meeting, both sides discussed and signed an "Agreement." The "Agreement" stipulates that both sides, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, friendly consultation, and promotion of two-way exchanges, will facilitate communication and cooperation in economic and technological exchanges, trade (including import and export trade, exhibitions, advertising, etc.), investment, intellectual property rights, certification, mediation, arbitration, and business law between the two sides of the strait. They will provide consultation and services; assist enterprises in handling and mediating disputes arising from the aforementioned matters; study the establishment of arbitration work; assist in protecting the legitimate rights of enterprises on both sides of the strait; facilitate visits, observation, and understanding among business and industry figures; organize economic and trade cooperation, as well as research and development activities related to intellectual property rights, to promote the development of civilian economic and trade exchanges between the two sides of the strait.

The "Agreement" clearly stipulates that a joint committee meeting will be held once a year to discuss related issues, and a temporary meeting will be held if necessary; both sides will regularly exchange information and materials, provide effective consultation and services, and strive to promote and arrange mutual visits between both sides; after reaching an agreement, both sides will, if necessary, discuss the establishment of a joint organization to better promote economic and trade exchanges between the two sides.

Zheng Hongye, chairman of the Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Coordination Committee from the mainland, spoke at the meeting, expressing his belief that this event will be recorded in history.

Zheng Hongye said that this year, the trans-shipment trade between the two sides of the strait will reach over 3 billion US dollars, and there are already more than 500 investment projects by Taiwanese compatriots on the mainland. This is a welcome phenomenon. However, indirect trade inevitably involves an intermediary layer, which is not beneficial to both sides. We suggest that both sides' coordination committees do some promotional work. The first is the legal issue; the second is mediation and arbitration of business disputes; the third is business consultation and legal services; the fourth is trademark and patent protection.

Zhang Pingzhao, chairman of the Cross-Strait Business Coordination Committee from Taiwan, also expressed in his speech that he believes that economic and trade exchanges between the two sides of the strait will become more frequent, and the trade volume will grow even faster. He hopes that both sides will work together to overcome difficulties and contribute to the development of cross-strait economic and trade.

    海峡两岸首次在港开会协调经贸
    双方经贸商务协调会签订《协议书》
    据新华社香港12月16日电　（记者端木来娣）海峡两岸经贸协调会和海峡两岸商务协调会今天在香港举行第一次委员会议，双方签订了《协议书》。
    日前，大陆和台湾各自在香港成立了一个商务协调会。台湾方面名为“海峡两岸商务协调会”，会长由张平沼担任，成员有35人。大陆方面名为“海峡两岸经贸协调会”，会长由郑鸿业担任，成员有25人。双方协调会成员均为工商企业界人士、专家和学者。
    在今天的会议上，双方讨论和签署了一份《协议书》。《协议书》规定，双方本着平等互惠、友好协商、促进双向交流的精神，为海峡两岸在经济技术交流，贸易往来（包括进出口贸易、展览、广告宣传等）、投资、智慧（知识）财产权、公私文书之认证、调解、仲裁，以及商务法律方面进行沟通和合作，提供咨询和服务；协助厂商办理和调解上述有关事项中发生的纠纷；研究开展仲裁工作的有关事项；协助维护厂商在海峡两岸应有的权益；协助工商界人士相互访问、观摩了解；举办经济贸易合作，以及智慧（知识）财产权等有关之研究发展活动，促进海峡两岸民间经济贸易交流及其发展。
    《协议书》明确规定，每一年举行委员联席会议一次，共同讨论有关问题，必要时举行临时会议；双方经常交换有关信息和资料，有效地提供咨询和服务，并尽力促进和安排双方人员互相访问；双方达成协议后，必要时得研议筹组联合机构，以便更有效促进两岸经济贸易交流。
    大陆方面的海峡两岸经贸协调会会长郑鸿业在会上致词，表示相信人们将会把这件事情载入史册。
    郑鸿业说，今年海峡两岸转口贸易额将达到30亿美元以上，台湾同胞在大陆投资项目已达500多个，这是可喜的现象。但是，间接贸易毕竟在中间隔了一层，对双方都不利。我们建议双方的协调会做一些促进工作。第一件是法律问题；第二件是关于商务争议的调解和仲裁；第三件是关于工商咨询和法律服务问题；第四件是关于商标和专利保护问题。
    台湾方面的海峡两岸商务协调会会长张平沼在致词中也表示，相信海峡两岸经贸往来将越来越多，贸易额将更快增长，希望双方共同努力，克服困难，为促进两岸经贸发展贡献心力。
