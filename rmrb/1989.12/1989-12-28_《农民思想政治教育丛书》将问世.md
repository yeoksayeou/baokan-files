The Series of Books on Ideological and Political Education for Peasants Will Be Published

According to Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, the series of books on ideological and political education for peasants, organized and compiled by the Propaganda Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, will soon be published by the Xinhua Publishing House. This series includes four books: "Talking About State Affairs and Understanding," "National Conditions and Rural Development," "Answers to Questions About Rural Policies," and "Casual Talks on Peasant Morality." The language in these books is both profound and easy to understand, making them excellent teaching materials for the broad peasant masses to learn about the current situation and the Party's policies. They can also be used as textbooks for training cadres in rural grassroots party schools.
