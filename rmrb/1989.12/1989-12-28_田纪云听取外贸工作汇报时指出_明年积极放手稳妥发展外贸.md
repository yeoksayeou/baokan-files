	Vice Premier Tian Jiyun pointed out the need to actively, boldly, and prudently develop foreign economic and trade relations in the coming year while listening to a report on foreign trade work on December 26. He emphasized the need to promote stable growth in exports and actively encourage foreign investment.

	Tian Jiyun fully affirmed the foreign trade work of 1989. He said that according to customs statistics, the total import and export volume for the first 11 months of this year has reached $98 billion, and it is estimated that the full-year figure will reach $110 billion. Both import and export volumes have increased by more than 10% compared to last year.

	Tian Jiyun said that the guiding principle for foreign economic and trade work in the coming year is to actively, boldly, and prudently develop China's foreign economic and trade relations. He pointed out that the basic policies formed in the 10 years of reform in foreign economic and trade relations should not be changed and should be improved and developed. The contract responsibility system for foreign trade and the policy of encouraging exports will remain unchanged. Strengthening the management of export commodity purchase prices and preventing production enterprises and supply units from taking advantage of exchange rate adjustments to raise prices indiscriminately is necessary. The enthusiasm of both the central government and local governments should be fully utilized. The export volume for next year should not only not be reduced but should also strive to increase, maintaining stable growth. Imports should also maintain a certain scale, with priority given to the import of materials necessary for production, construction, and people's livelihood. Foreign investment should be actively encouraged, and efforts should be made to genuinely complete a few projects. The investment environment in the country, especially in economic and technological development zones and coastal open cities, should be further improved, with particular attention paid to improving the soft environment to make our investment environment truly attractive to foreigners.

	Tian Jiyun demanded the further rectification and improvement of the foreign trade environment and order. For the current chaotic situation in foreign trade, especially the lack of credibility, contract breaches, and "one-off" transactions, and even the disregard for personal and national dignity, administrative, legal, and economic measures should be used to resolutely address these issues.

    田纪云听取外贸工作汇报时指出
    明年积极放手稳妥发展外贸
    本报北京12月27日讯　新华社记者傅刚、张毅、本报记者陆振华报道：国务院副总理田纪云12月26日在听取经贸部负责人汇报外贸工作时指出，明年要采取积极、放手、稳妥的方针发展对外经济贸易，促进出口稳定增长，积极鼓励外商投资。
    田纪云充分肯定了1989年的外贸工作。他说，按海关统计，今年1—11月全国进出口总额已达980亿美元，预计全年可达1100亿美元，进出口额都比去年增长10％以上。
    田纪云说，明年对外经贸工作的方针是积极、放手、稳妥地发展我国的对外经济贸易。他指出，10年改革中逐步形成的对外经济贸易中的一些基本政策，不能改变，要加以完善和发展。明年外贸承包制不变、鼓励出口的政策不变。要加强出口商品收购价格管理，制止生产企业和供货单位借汇率调整的机会乱涨价。进一步发挥中央和地方的两个积极性。明年的外贸出口，不仅不能减少，而且要力争多出一点，保持稳定增长。进口也要保持一定的规模，生产建设和人民生活必需的物资要优先保证进口。对外商投资要积极鼓励，要脚踏实地地真正办成几件事，进一步改善全国特别是经济特区、经济技术开发区和沿海开放城市的投资环境，尤其要注重改善软环境，使我们的投资环境对外商真正有吸引力。
    田纪云要求进一步治理整顿外贸环境和秩序。对于当前外贸中的混乱现象，特别是不讲信誉、不守合同、作“一锤子”买卖，甚至不要人格、国格的情况，要下狠心、下功夫用行政、法律、经济的手段加以解决。
