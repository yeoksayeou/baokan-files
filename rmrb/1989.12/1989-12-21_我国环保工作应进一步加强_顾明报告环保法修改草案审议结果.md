Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th.

The Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress held its eleventh meeting today. Gu Ming, Vice Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress, reported on the results of the deliberation of the draft revision of the Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China.

Gu Ming said that the Law Committee believes that the current environmental pollution situation in China is quite serious, and environmental protection work should be further strengthened. Some provisions of the Environmental Protection Law (trial version) enacted in 1979 are no longer in line with the needs of the changing situation, and it is necessary to amend them. The draft amendment is basically feasible. At the same time, some suggestions for amendment were proposed.

Gu Ming said that the draft stipulates: "The State Council's environmental protection administrative department shall implement comprehensive supervision and management of environmental protection work nationwide." Some committee members and local and departmental representatives suggested that the regulations in the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law and the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law are both "unified supervision and management," and the legal provisions should be consistent. Therefore, it is suggested to amend it to: "The State Council's environmental protection administrative department shall implement unified supervision and management of environmental protection work nationwide." "The environmental protection administrative department of the local people's government at or above the county level shall implement unified supervision and management of environmental protection work in its jurisdiction." The draft stipulates: "The relevant departments of the State Council and the military shall, in accordance with the law, supervise and manage the environmental protection work of their respective departments, industries, and the military."

Gu Ming pointed out that the draft stipulates: "All units discharging pollutants shall pay pollution discharge fees in accordance with national regulations; those exceeding the national or local pollutant discharge standards shall pay over-standard pollution discharge fees in accordance with national regulations and be responsible for treatment." Some committee members and local, departmental, and enterprise representatives suggested that it is appropriate to pay over-standard pollution discharge fees, but the practice of paying pollution discharge fees even if the discharge does not exceed the standard is only stipulated in the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law. The Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law and the Noise Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations do not have such provisions. At present, the burden on enterprises is already heavy, and the funds of government agencies and schools are even more tight. Requiring units that discharge smoke, waste gas, noise, and discarded materials to pay pollution discharge fees makes it difficult for enterprises to bear the burden. Therefore, it is suggested to amend it to: "Enterprises and institutions that discharge pollutants exceeding the national or local pollutant discharge standards shall pay over-standard pollution discharge fees in accordance with national regulations and be responsible for treatment. The Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law has other provisions, which shall be implemented in accordance with the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law."

Gu Ming said that according to the opinions of the Financial and Economic Committee and some local and departmental representatives, it is suggested to add a clause in Article 30 of the draft: "The dismantling or idling of pollution control facilities shall be subject to the approval of the environmental protection administrative department of the place." And in the chapter on legal responsibilities, it is correspondingly stipulated: "Without the approval of the environmental protection administrative department, the dismantling or idling of pollution control facilities, if the discharge of pollutants exceeds the prescribed standards, shall be ordered by the environmental protection administrative department to reinstall and use, and a fine shall be imposed."

Gu Ming said that the draft stipulates that administrative penalties shall be imposed on those who "do not implement the provisions of simultaneous design, simultaneous construction, and simultaneous production and use of environmental protection facilities with the main project." Some local and departmental representatives suggested that for construction projects that do not implement the "three simultaneities" and are put into production or use, they should be ordered to stop production or use. Therefore, it is suggested to amend the above provisions to: "If the pollution control facilities of a construction project have not been completed or do not meet the national requirements, they shall be put into production or use, and shall be ordered by the environmental protection administrative department that approved the environmental impact report of the construction project to stop production or use, and may also impose a fine." And this amendment shall be stipulated as a separate article.

### 我国环保工作应进一步加强  顾明报告环保法修改草案审议结果

    我国环保工作应进一步加强
    顾明报告环保法修改草案审议结果
    新华社北京12月20日电  全国人大法律委员会副主任委员顾明向今天召开的七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议作了全国人大法律委员会对中华人民共和国环境保护法修改草案审议结果的报告。
    顾明说，法律委员会认为，目前我国的环境污染情况相当严重，环境保护工作应当进一步加强，1979年制定的环境保护法（试行）的有些规定已不适应形势发展的需要，加以修改是必要的，修改草案基本上是可行的。同时，提出一些修改意见。
    顾明说，草案规定：“国务院环境保护行政主管部门，对全国环境保护工作实施综合监督管理。”有些委员和地方、部门提出，水污染防治法和大气污染防治法两法所作的规定都是“统一监督管理”，法律的规定应当一致。因此，建议修改为：“国务院环境保护行政主管部门，对全国环境保护工作实施统一监督管理。”“县级以上地方人民政府环境保护行政主管部门，对本辖区的环境保护工作实施统一监督管理。”草案规定：“国务院有关部门及军队，依法对本部门、本行业及军队的环境保护工作实施监督管理。”
    顾明指出，草案规定：“一切单位排放污染物，应当依照国家规定缴纳排污费；超过国家或者地方规定的污染物排放标准的，依照国家规定缴纳超标准排污费，并负责治理。”有些委员和地方、部门、企业提出，缴纳超标准排污费是适当的，但排污不超过标准也要缴纳排污费这个办法只有水污染防治法作了规定，大气污染防治法和噪声污染防治条例都未作这种规定。目前企业的负担已经很重，机关、学校等单位的经费更是十分紧张，要求排放烟尘、废气、噪声和倾倒废弃物的单位都缴纳排污费，这种办法普遍实施企业等难以承受。因此，建议修改为：“排放污染物超过国家或者地方规定的污染物排放标准的企业事业单位，依照国家规定缴纳超标准排污费，并负责治理。水污染防治法另有规定的，依照水污染防治法的规定执行。”
    顾明说，根据财经委员会和有些地方、部门的意见，建议在草案第30条中增加一款：“拆除或者闲置防治污染设施，应当征得所在地的环境保护行政主管部门同意。”并在法律责任一章中相应规定：“未经环境保护行政主管部门同意，擅自拆除或者闲置防治污染设施，污染物排放超过规定的排放标准的，由环境保护行政主管部门责令重新安装使用，并处罚款。”
    顾明说，草案规定，对“不执行环境保护设施与主体工程同时设计、同时施工、同时投产使用规定的”给予行政处罚。有些地方、部门提出，对不执行“三同时”规定而投入生产或者使用的建设项目，应当责令停止生产或者使用。因此，建议将上述规定修改为：“建设项目的防治污染设施没有建成或者没有达到国家规定的要求，投入生产或者使用的，由审批该建设项目的环境影响报告书的环境保护行政主管部门责令停止生产或者使用，可以并处罚款。”并将这项修改规定单独作为一条。
