    Ticket Purchase Diary
    September 16th, 5 AM: Two lines of people have already formed in front of the sleeper ticket pre-sale window at Changchun Railway Station.
    6:30 AM: Tickets are sold on time, but there is commotion in front of the window. Seven or eight young men tightly surround the two windows, buying up the sleeper tickets. The crowd waiting in line is very dissatisfied. A female comrade shouted at them, "Can't you have a bit of morality? People have been standing here for hours!" "No, no," they mimicked her tone, pinching their noses, and then laughed loudly.
    October 1st, 4:30 AM: The sleeper ticket pre-sale window at Changchun Railway Station is already crowded with people. A group of about ten people, dressed in rags, are seen chasing, fighting, and making a ruckus. The tickets are being sold! They show their skills. A man in a suit stands outside the crowd, looking at the window, holding a wooden stick in his hand, giving orders to the ten or so people. Among them, a lame man is very agile, quickly reaching the window in a few steps. The sleeper tickets are stuffed into the suit pocket of the man in the suit. Twenty minutes pass, and all 15 sleeper tickets to Yanji are bought by them.
    October 2nd, 3:30 AM: At the sleeper ticket pre-sale window of Changchun Railway Station, I encountered those people again: the one holding the stick, the lame man...
    "My mother is not well. To buy a sleeper ticket for her, I have been getting up early for three consecutive days. Today, it's all over again." A middle-aged teacher is almost desperate.

    买票日记 
    9月16日晨5点：长春火车站预售卧铺票窗口前已排起了两行队伍。
    6点30分：准时卖票，窗口前也出现了骚动。七八个青年人紧紧围住两个窗口，把一张张卧铺票买走。排队的群众对此十分不满。一位女同志冲着这伙人说：“你们讲点道德好不好，别人已站了几个小时了。”“不好，不好”，这伙人捏着鼻子，学起她的腔调，然后哈哈大笑。
    10月1日晨4点半：长春火车站预售卧铺票窗口前已是人头攒动。只见十几个衣着破旧的人不时地追打着、骂着、闹着。卖票了！他们大显身手。一个穿西服的人站在人群外，望着窗口，他的手中拿着一根木棒，向那十几个人发出了“指令”。其中一个瘸子非常麻利，三下两下就上了窗口。一张张卧铺票装进了穿西服人的衣袋中。20分钟过去了，到延吉的15张卧铺票，全被他们买去。
    10月2日晨3时半：在长春火车站预售卧铺票窗口前，我又碰上了那帮家伙：手持木棒的指挥、瘸子……
    “我母亲身体不好。为给老人买张卧铺票，我已连续三天起大早了。今天又完了。”一个中年教师几乎绝望了。
