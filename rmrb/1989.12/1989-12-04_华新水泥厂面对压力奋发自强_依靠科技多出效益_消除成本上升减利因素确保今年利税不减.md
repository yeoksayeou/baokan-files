Hua Xin Cement Plant Faces Pressure and Strives for Self-Improvement
Relying on Technology to Increase Efficiency
Eliminating Factors of Rising Costs to Ensure Profits and Taxes Do Not Decrease
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan — Reporter Gong Dafa reports: Facing the dual pressures of rising costs and falling product market prices, Hua Xin Cement Plant in Hubei Province relies on "technological innovation" to basically eliminate the factors of reduced profits due to rising costs.

Hua Xin Cement Plant is the "elder brother" of the building materials industry in China. In the 1950s, it was famous as the "first in the Far East." Its main products have all won national, ministerial, and provincial awards. Among them, "Five Rams" and "Fortress" brand cements have both won the national gold award. This year, due to the reduction in the scale of basic construction, the market price of cement has fallen. From January to September, due to the increase in transportation and raw material prices, it resulted in a reduction in profits of 4000,000 yuan.

Facing difficulties, the decision-makers of Hua Xin did not ask the state to reduce taxes and benefits, but rather leveraged the strengths of the old factory's robust technical capabilities. They launched "technological innovation" activities to eliminate the factors of reduced profits. This year, they have successively developed 3 new products and completed two technological transformation projects, enhancing the enterprise's momentum. At the same time, they optimized the product structure, increased the production of early-strength cement in high demand in the market, and the factory can thus increase economic benefits by more than 1000,000 yuan for the year.

In response to the difficulties of insufficient main raw material slag resources and price increases, the factory's technical personnel actively developed substitutes. They used cheap materials such as fly ash, coal gangue, and limestone from power plants to replace part of the slag, not only making up for the shortage of resources but also reducing costs by more than 800,000 yuan. The cement plant deals with large quantities of bulky materials, making precise measurement very difficult. This year, the factory has continuously improved measurement technology and strictly managed measurements. They carefully measured the incoming raw coal, slag, and outgoing finished cement to reduce waste. By the end of September, just the reduction in waste of bulk cement alone amounted to more than 7,000 tons, valued at 1,260,000 yuan.

So far, the entire factory has gained direct economic benefits of more than 4,000,000 yuan, basically eliminating the factors of reduced profits, and ensuring that the profits and taxes paid to the state do not decrease.

    华新水泥厂面对压力奋发自强
    依靠科技多出效益
    消除成本上升减利因素确保今年利税不减
    本报武汉电　记者龚达发报道：面对成本上升、产品市场价格下降的双重压力，湖北省的华新水泥厂依靠“科技创效”，基本消除了成本上升造成的减利因素。
    华新水泥厂是我国建材行业的“老大哥”，50年代就以“远东第一”闻名于世。其主要产品全部获得国优、部优、省优称号，其中“五羊”、“堡垒”牌水泥双双荣获国家金质奖。今年以来，由于压缩基本建设规模，水泥市场价格下降。1—9月，因运输、原材料涨价，便造成减利因素400万元。
    面对困难，华新的决策者们没有要求国家减税让利，而是发挥老厂技术力量雄厚的优势，开展“科技创效”活动，消除减利因素。今年以来，先后开发出3个新产品、完成两项技术改造项目，增强了企业后劲。同时优化产品结构，增产市场需求量大的早强型水泥，工厂因此全年可增加经济效益100多万元。
    针对主要原材料矿渣资源不足、价格上涨等困难，该厂科技人员积极开发代用品，利用电厂粉煤灰渣、煤矸石、石灰石等廉价材料代替部分矿渣，不仅弥补了资源不足，还降低成本80多万元。水泥厂进出都是大宗笨重的物资，精确计量十分困难。今年以来，厂里不断改进计量技术，严格计量管理，对进厂的原煤、矿渣和出厂的成品水泥都进行认真计量，减少浪费。到9月底，仅出厂散装水泥一项就减少损耗7000多吨，价值126万元。
    到目前为止，全厂已从中获直接经济效益400多万元，基本消除了减利因素，确保了上交国家利税不减。
