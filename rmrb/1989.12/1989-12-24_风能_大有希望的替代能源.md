Wind energy is also a renewable energy source that is inexhaustible. The reserves of wind energy are abundant. It is estimated that the wind energy available on land worldwide is approximately one hundred billion kilowatts, tens of times the water resources. Because wind energy is easy to obtain and convenient to use, people in various parts of the world have been utilizing it for production and living over the years. However, the large-scale development of wind energy as an alternative energy source began only in the past twenty years. Since the 1980s, due to technological advancements, the scale of wind energy development has rapidly expanded. In recent years, many countries have increased their investments in wind energy development, and the utilization of wind energy has reached a peak.

The United Kingdom has high hopes for wind energy. Recent surveys have shown that the UK has abundant wind resources, and wind power generation can at least meet 20% of the UK's electricity needs. The survey report states that the UK has 3,000 to 6,000 square kilometers of wind-rich areas, which are ideal sites for large-scale wind power generation. Additionally, the development of wind energy costs only two pence per kilowatt of electricity, while nuclear and coal-fired power cost three pence. Wind energy is not only economically competitive with nuclear energy but also avoids the safety and pollution issues associated with nuclear energy.

The United States began implementing a federal wind energy plan in 1974. By 1987, the US had 1,566 million wind turbines, an increase of 330 million from 1985. The total installed capacity had risen from 1,026 million kilowatts in 1985 to over 1,400 million kilowatts. Currently, the installed capacity of each wind turbine in the US has increased from 25 kilowatts in the early 1980s to 200 kilowatts today, and the construction cost of wind power systems has dropped from $3,000 per kilowatt to $1,000. The long-term plan of the US Department of Energy indicates that wind energy will become an important renewable alternative energy source for the United States in the 21st century.

West Germany built a 250-kilowatt ship-based wind power station on the island of Sylt seven years ago. Subsequently, a floating wind power station with a capacity of 7 megawatts was built, generating 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, with a cost of approximately $0.04 per kilowatt-hour. This demonstrates the good economic viability of wind power generation.

The Dutch government formulated a plan for large-scale development of wind power generation five years ago, aiming to invest $5 billion by the year 2000 to achieve 3,000 megawatts of direct wind power generation, in addition to 2,400 megawatts of hydroelectric power, which would be sufficient to meet the peak electricity demand in the Netherlands.

In recent years, residential buildings powered by a hybrid wind and solar energy system have become popular in the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Japan. These buildings obtain 80% of their energy needs from wind and solar power. When the wind speed reaches 26 miles per hour, it can generate 25 kilowatts of electricity, with excess energy stored in batteries.

The rapid development of wind power generation has led to the prosperity of the windmill manufacturing industry.

Denmark, a developed country, has long been short of energy. Over the years, reliance on wind power has not only eased the energy crisis but also developed into the world's largest windmill producer. Currently, Denmark exports windmills worth 1.4 billion kroner annually, with products shipped to dozens of countries.

    风能——大有希望的替代能源
    风能也是一种取之不尽用之不竭的可再生能源。风能的蕴藏量十分丰富，据估计，全世界陆地上可利用的风能约一百亿千瓦，为水力资源的数十倍。由于风能容易取得和便于利用，一些年来，世界各地都有人在利用它为生产和生活服务。但是，风能作为了替代能源而大规模开发，则是近二十多年的事。进入八十年代后，由于技术进步，风能开发的规模急剧扩大。近几年，许多国家增加了对风能的开发性投资，风能开发利用趋于高潮。
    英国对风能寄予很大期望。最近调查表明，英国拥有丰富的风力资源，风力发电至少可满足英国百分之二十的电力需要。调查报告说，英国有三千到六千平方公里的风力密集地区，是良好的巨型风力发电基地。另外，发展风能，每千瓦电力的成本仅二便士，而核能和煤电要三便士。风能不但经济性不亚于核能，并且绝无不安全和污染等不利的社会问题。
    美国一九七四年开始执行联邦风能规划，一九八七年美国已拥有风力发电机组一千五百六十六万台，比一九八五年增加三千三百台，总装机容量已由一九八五年的一千零二十六兆瓦增至目前的一千四百兆瓦以上。目前，美国每台风力发电机的装机容量已从八十年代初期的二十五千瓦提高到现在的二百千瓦，风力发电系统的建造成本已由每千瓦三千美元降至一千美元。美国能源部的长远计划表明，风能将成为二十一世纪美国重要的可再生替代能源。
    西德早在七年前就在许尔特岛建成一座发电量为二百五十千瓦的船用风能发电站。之后，又建成飘浮型风力发电站，发电量达七兆瓦，每年可输出电力二千五百万千瓦小时，发电成本每千瓦小时约零点零四美元，证实风力发电具有很好的经济性。
    荷兰政府早在五年前就拟定了大规模发展风力发电的计划，计划在二○○○年以前投资五十亿美元，完成直接利用风能发电三千兆瓦，外加上二千四百兆瓦水力发电，这就足以应付荷兰每年高峰用电的不足。
    近几年，一种由风能与太阳能混合发电系统供电的居民住宅已经在美国、西德、荷兰、英国和日本等国家普及，住宅所需的能源百分之八十由风力和太阳能供给，当风的时速为二十六英里时，能够发出二十五千瓦的电力，多余的电能可积蓄在蓄电池中。
    风能发电的迅速发展导致风车制造业的兴旺发达。
    丹麦是个发达国家，但能源缺乏，多年来依靠风力不仅缓和了能源紧张的矛盾，而且发展成世界最大的风车生产国，目前丹麦每年出口风车价值十四亿克朗，产品向数十个国家出口。
