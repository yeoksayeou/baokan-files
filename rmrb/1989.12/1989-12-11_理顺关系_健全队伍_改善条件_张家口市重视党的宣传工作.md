    Streamline Relations, Strengthen Teams, Improve Conditions
    Zhangjiakou City Attaches Importance to Party Propaganda Work

    The following is a report from our correspondent: Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the various levels of Party organizations in Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, have taken effective measures to address some of the issues in propaganda work, and propaganda cadres generally feel more motivated and energetic.

    The Party organizations at various levels in Zhangjiakou City have conducted in-depth studies on strengthening propaganda work, focusing on resolving issues related to the improper relationships and insufficient personnel in propaganda departments.

    Restore organizations, replenish forces. Currently, out of the 25 propaganda departments that were either abolished or merged, 18 have been restored. The remaining ones are in the process of being restored. Additionally, 23 units have selected and appointed 51 propaganda cadres.

    Strengthen leadership, establish systems. Large enterprises such as the Xuanhua Steel Company, Coal Mining Machinery Factory, Exploration Machinery Factory, and Tractor Factory have successively revised and established various systems for propaganda work, incorporating them into target management, with regular inspections and assessments. Central, provincial, and municipal-level medium and large enterprises have generally established systems for joint meetings of Party, government, and workers, as well as Party Committee coordination meetings.

    Create conditions, improve benefits. Many units have ensured that propaganda cadres receive the same benefits in bonuses and housing allocation as other administrative and technical cadres. The city has 17 enterprises that have evaluated the professional titles for 55 full-time propaganda cadres.

    Select and send cadres for further study. The Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department and the Municipal Party School have organized a specialized class for full-time propaganda cadres, selecting 50 cadres from grassroots units for further study. Some units have also sent propaganda cadres to study at radio universities, correspondence universities, and vocational universities.

    Various units, despite financial constraints, have focused on solving issues related to insufficient propaganda funds and outdated equipment. The Chemical Raw Materials Factory and Xuanhua Brewery have even purchased audio and video equipment for their propaganda departments.

    理顺关系　健全队伍　改善条件
    张家口市重视党的宣传工作
    本报讯　河北省张家口市各级党组织，采取有效措施，认真解决宣传工作中存在的一些问题，宣传干部普遍感到气顺了，劲足了。
    党的十三届四中全会后，张家口市各级党组织对加强宣传工作进行了专题研究，并着重解决宣传机构关系不顺和人手不足的问题。
    恢复机构，充实力量。目前，25个被撤销或合并宣传部门的单位，已有18个得到恢复。其余的正在着手恢复。有23个单位共选调充实宣传干部51人。
    加强领导，健全制度。宣化钢铁公司、煤矿机械厂、探矿机械厂、拖车总厂等大型企业，先后重新修订和建立了宣传工作的各项制度，并纳入目标管理，定期检查、考核。中央、省直和市属中型以上企业，普遍建立了党、政、工碰头会和党委协调工作会议等制度。
    创造条件，提高待遇。不少单位宣传干部在奖金、住房分配等待遇方面与其他行政技术干部一样。全市已有17个企业先后为55名专职宣传干部评定了职称。
    选送干部学习深造。市委宣传部、市委党校筹办了专职宣传干部大专班，从基层单位选出50名宣传干部学习深造。还有一些单位选送宣传干部参加了电大、函大、职大学习。
    各单位在资金比较紧张的情况下，注重解决宣传经费不足、设备简陋的问题，化工原料厂、宣化啤酒厂等单位还为宣传部门购置了录音、录像等设备。　（王克强）
