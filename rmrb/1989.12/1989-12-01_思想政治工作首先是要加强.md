In his speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to earnestly promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and specifically pointed out that ideological and political work must be strengthened and improved.

Strengthening and improving ideological and political work are two interrelated aspects. Together, they address the need to place greater emphasis on ideological and political work under the conditions of reform and opening up, to innovate and improve the quality of ideological and political work on the basis of inheriting its fine traditions, so as to adapt to new situations and solve new problems. Given the imbalance between material civilization and spiritual civilization in recent years, we first emphasize the need to strengthen ideological and political work. This is both a review of the past, drawing on the valuable lessons from the major political turmoil in the spring and summer, and a look to the future, an important guarantee for achieving new victories in modernization.

Over the past 60-plus years, the reason our Party has been able to overcome numerous difficulties and grow stronger is that in every historical period, we have fully leveraged the great appeal and inspiration of ideological and political work in implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies. Whether it is an individual, a team, or a nation, everyone needs a spiritual pillar. Ideological and political work is about helping people establish a strong spiritual pillar, thereby inspiring them to strive and pursue their goals. In the complex conditions of reform and opening up and the development of a socialist planned commodity economy, ideological and political work is particularly important. Only by continuously strengthening ideological and political work can people maintain firm political beliefs and clear minds in complex environments; otherwise, there is a risk of losing their spiritual pillar and political direction.

Our ideological and political work has taken a detour and made "leftist" mistakes in the past. There is no doubt that we must resolutely abandon the "leftist" approach. However, abandoning the "leftist" approach does not mean we should negate ideological and political work. On the contrary, it is to better and more effectively strengthen ideological and political work. Unfortunately, in recent years, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's requirements to strengthen spiritual civilization construction and to strengthen rather than weaken ideological and political work have not been seriously implemented. For a long time, the Four Cardinal Principles have not been emphasized, ideological and political work has been relaxed and weakened, the status and role of ideological and political work have been downgraded, principles have been abandoned, and the construction of the workforce has been neglected. This has encouraged and tolerated the serious spread of bourgeois liberalization. This cannot be said to be an important cause of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the biggest mistake of the past decade is that education and ideological and political work for the people have been weak. This painful lesson from the opposite side tells us that we must vigorously strengthen ideological and political work.

Perhaps some comrades will ask, isn't our task to focus on economic construction and concentrate on developing productive forces? Yes, this is indisputable. We strive to smoothly achieve the strategic goal of modernizing economic construction in three steps and to build our country into a modern socialist power as soon as possible. The current tasks of rectification and deepening reform are very heavy, and we must concentrate our efforts and work hard. But this does not mean that strengthening ideological and political work is separate from this. First, while we are wholeheartedly engaged in economic construction, we must never forget that we are a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party, and that we are wholeheartedly building a socialist modernization. On this issue of political direction, our comrades cannot be the slightest bit careless. Socialist modernization is not just a material and technical concept; it is the process of our country's overall development and progress. In this process, if we only focus on the economy and do not pay attention to ideological and political trends, relax ideological and political work, and lose our way, international and domestic hostile forces will take the opportunity to stir up trouble and disrupt the socialist modernization construction. Vigorously strengthening ideological and political work is to ensure that our economic construction does not lose its way. Political work is the lifeline of economic work. After suppressing the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, we should have a deeper understanding of this Marxist principle. Second, among the elements of social productive forces, people are the first element. To do a good job in economic construction and other work, we must first educate and inspire people, mobilize their enthusiasm. This requires us to do a good job in ideological and political work. The idea that "a basket of big principles is not as good as a piece of unity" does not conform to socialist principles and does not conform to the facts of social life. The broad masses of Party members and the people are not living for money, and we will not abandon and sell our principles for money. Of course, we do not deny material incentives and should combine material incentives with ideological and political work. The key here is to combine theory with practice, to explain the big principles deeply and thoroughly, to make them practical and deeply rooted in people's hearts. This requires us to seriously work hard, to innovate and summarize new experiences on the basis of inheriting the fine traditions of ideological and political work, and to turn the "strengthening" into creative labor.

Ultimately, strengthening ideological and political work depends on the recognition and actions of Party organizations at all levels. In the previous period, ideological and political work was seriously weakened, which cannot be blamed on the grassroots Party organizations, nor can it be blamed on the broad cadre of political workers. They are not convinced of the weakening of Party leadership and ideological and political work, have objections, and even resist it. Precisely because of this, they wholeheartedly support the decision of the new Party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to strengthen and improve ideological and political work. We hope that Party organizations at all levels, in the current extremely busy work, will seriously study the relevant issues of strengthening ideological and political work, strengthen the construction of the ideological and political work force, handle the relationship between ideological and political work and other work, and extensively and deeply conduct ideological education among the broad masses of Party members and the people on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and patriotism, collectivism, self-reliance, and hard work, as well as revolutionary tradition education. Only in this way can we fully leverage our political advantages, overcome difficulties, maintain social and political stability, complete the arduous tasks of rectification and deepening reform, and promote the socialist modernization cause to move forward in the correct direction.

    思想政治工作首先是要加强
    本报评论员
    江泽民同志在庆祝国庆40周年的讲话中，强调要切实抓好社会主义精神文明建设，并且具体指出，要加强和改进思想政治工作。
    思想政治工作一要加强二要改进，这是互相联系的两个侧面。这两个侧面综合起来要解决的问题，就是要在改革开放的条件下更加重视思想政治工作，要在继承思想政治工作优良传统的基础上改革创新，提高思想政治工作的质量，以适应新情况，解决新问题。鉴于近几年物质文明建设和精神文明建设出现了一手硬一手软的状况，这里我们首先强调的是思想政治工作要加强。这既是回顾过去，总结春夏之交这场大的政治风波得到的宝贵教训，也是展望未来，夺取现代化建设新胜利的重要保证。
    60多年来，我们党的事业之所以能够克服重重困难，不断发展壮大，一条重要的经验，就是我们在各个历史时期围绕着党的路线、方针、政策的贯彻，充分发挥了思想政治工作巨大的感召和激励作用。不论是一个人、一支队伍，还是一个民族，都要有自己的精神支柱。思想政治工作就是要帮助人们树立起坚强的精神支柱，从而鼓起勇气去追求和奋斗。在改革开放、发展社会主义有计划的商品经济的复杂条件下，思想政治工作尤其重要。只有不断加强思想政治工作，才能使人们在复杂的环境中保持坚定的政治信念和清醒的头脑，否则，就有丧失精神支柱、迷失政治方向的危险。
    我们的思想政治工作曾经走过弯路，有过“左”的失误。毫无疑义，对“左”的一套必须坚决摒弃。但是，我们摒弃过去“左”的一套，绝不意味着要否定思想政治工作。恰恰相反，是为了更好地更有效地加强思想政治工作。但是，令人痛心的是，近些年来，邓小平同志关于加强精神文明建设，关于思想政治工作只能加强、不能削弱的一系列要求没有得到认真的贯彻执行。很长一段时间里，四项基本原则不大讲了，思想政治工作放松了、削弱了，思想政治工作的地位和作用被贬低，原则性被放弃，队伍建设遭到忽视。这就助长和纵容了资产阶级自由化的严重泛滥。这不能不说是导致动乱和反革命暴乱发生的重要原因。邓小平同志指出，10年最大的失误是对人民的教育和思想政治工作薄弱了。这个创巨痛深的教训，从反面告诫我们，一定要大力加强思想政治工作。
    或许有的同志会问，我们的工作任务不是以经济建设为中心，一心一意地发展生产力吗？是的，这是没有疑问的。我们要力争顺利实现现代化经济建设“三步曲”的战略目标，早日把我国建设成为社会主义现代化强国。当前治理整顿、深化改革的任务十分繁重，我们更是要集中精力艰苦奋斗。但这和加强思想政治工作并不是割裂的。第一，在一心一意地投身于经济建设的同时，时刻不能忘记我们是共产党领导下的社会主义国家，我们一心一意所建设的是社会主义现代化。在这个政治方向的问题上，我们的同志不可以有丝毫的马虎。社会主义现代化不仅仅是一个物质的技术的概念，它是我们国家整体的发展和进步过程。在这个过程中，如果就经济抓经济，不关心思想政治动向，放松思想政治工作，迷失方向，国际国内的敌对势力就会乘机兴风作浪，就会破坏社会主义现代化建设的局面。大力加强思想政治工作，就是为了保证我们的经济建设不迷失方向。政治工作是经济工作的生命线，在平息了动乱和发生在北京的反革命暴乱之后，我们对这个马克思主义的原理应当有更深切的体会了。第二，在社会生产力诸要素中，人是第一要素。要想搞好经济建设和其他各项工作，首先要教育人，激励人，把人的积极性调动起来。这就要求我们把思想政治工作做好。那种认为“大道理一筐不如大团结一张”的想法，不符合社会主义的原则，也不符合社会生活中大量的事实。广大党员、群众并不是为钱活着的，我们也不会为了钱而丢弃和出卖我们的原则。当然，我们并不否定物质鼓励，应当把物质鼓励和思想政治工作结合起来。这里的关键是要把理论同实际结合起来，把大道理讲深讲透，讲得切合实际、深入人心。这就需要我们认真地下一番功夫，在继承思想政治工作优良传统的基础上大胆地探索和总结新鲜经验，把“加强”二字化为富有创造性的劳动。
    加强思想政治工作，归根结底要见诸各级党组织的认识和行动。前一段时间思想政治工作严重地削弱了，这不能责怪基层党组织，更不能责备广大政工干部。他们对淡化党的领导，削弱思想政治工作是想不通的，有意见的，甚至是有抵制的。正因为这样，他们由衷地拥护以江泽民同志为核心的新的党中央领导集体提出的加强和改进思想政治工作的决定。我们希望，各级党组织在当前极其繁忙的工作中，要认真地研究加强思想政治工作的有关问题，抓好思想政治工作队伍的建设，处理好思想政治工作和其他各项工作的关系，广泛而深入地向广大党员群众进行坚持四项基本原则和爱国主义、集体主义、自力更生和艰苦奋斗的思想教育以及革命传统教育。只有这样，才能充分发挥我们的政治优势，战胜困难，保持社会政治局势的稳定，完成治理整顿、深化改革的艰巨任务，推动社会主义现代化事业沿着正确的方向前进。
