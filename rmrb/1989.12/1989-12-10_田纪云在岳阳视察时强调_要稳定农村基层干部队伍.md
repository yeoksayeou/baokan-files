	Vice Premier Tian Jiyun emphasized during his inspection in Yueyang, Hunan Province, on December 6th that rural stability begins with stabilizing the rural grassroots cadre team. He stressed the importance of caring for, cherishing, relying on, and assisting them, and supporting their work.

	Tian Jiyun made these remarks when Hunan Provincial Party Secretary Xiong Qingquan mentioned that the current tasks for rural grassroots cadres are heavy and the challenges are numerous. The provincial party committee and government have decided to organize 50,000 cadres from various departments to go to the countryside this winter and next spring to assist with the work.

	Tian Jiyun said, "Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Rural grassroots cadres are on the front lines. Tasks such as grain procurement, family planning, and agricultural water conservancy projects are numerous and complex, all of which rely on grassroots cadres. The cadres we send down must rely on and assist them."

	Tian Jiyun pointed out that we should have a basic assessment of the rural grassroots cadre team. We should affirm that the majority are good and relatively good. We should affirm the work achievements of the majority of grassroots cadres and commend those who have performed well. Of course, there are individuals among the grassroots cadres who violate laws and discipline, but they are only a very small number.

    田纪云在岳阳视察时强调
    要稳定农村基层干部队伍
    新华社长沙十二月九日电　（记者邓全施）国务院副总理田纪云十二月六日在湖南省岳阳市视察时指出，农村要稳定，首先要稳定农村基层干部队伍；要关心、爱护、依靠、帮助他们，支持他们的工作。
    田纪云是在湖南省委书记熊清泉向他谈到当前农村基层干部工作任务重、困难多，省委、省政府决定在今冬明春组织五万名机关干部下乡帮助工作时说这番话的。
    田纪云说，农业是国民经济的基础，农村基层干部处于第一线，公购粮入库、计划生育、农田水利建设等等，工作千头万绪，都得靠基层干部；我们下去的机关干部一定要依靠他们，帮助他们。
    田纪云指出，对农村基层干部队伍要有一个基本估计，应该肯定绝大多数是好的，比较好的。要肯定绝大多数基层干部的工作成绩，表扬一批表现好的同志。当然，基层干部中违法乱纪的人是有的，但只是极个别的。
