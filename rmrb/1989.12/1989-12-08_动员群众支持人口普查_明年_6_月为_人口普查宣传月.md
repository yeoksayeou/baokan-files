The State Council's Leading Group for the Fourth National Census emphasized today: We must widely publicize the significance, purpose, content, and methods of the census to be held next July among cadres and the masses, so that the masses actively support the census work and conscientiously and responsibly report truthfully on each census item. To this end, the State Council's Leading Group for the Fourth National Census has decided that June next year will be "Census Promotion Month," during which extensive publicity will be carried out on the census to ensure the successful completion of the census work.
