	Visiting Huanghuagang
	Pang Jianke

	It was a massive and imposing stone archway. Standing beneath it, I suddenly felt myself as insignificant as a speck of dust, weightless and floating, firmly drawn to the sturdy stone pillars by an immense magnetic force, unable to move sideways or step away. The golden characters "Haoqi Changcun" (Haoqi Long Stores) on the archway's main gate shone brilliantly against the deep blue sky, the strong strokes of the calligraphy conveying a surge of righteousness and a masculine force that shook my soul and body.

	The pines surrounding the archway stood tall and dense under the bright red sun.

	The earth supporting the archway undulated gently amidst the vibrant yellow and purple flowers.

	A gentle breeze blew, and the rustling of the pines filled the air. It seemed as if the rolling waves had awakened an ancient chorus, growing louder and clearer as it approached. The chorus was led by a powerful male voice, accompanied by a soft and gentle female voice. The hoarse voices of the elderly blended with the clear voices of the children, creating a grand and heavy symphony. In the song, I could see the white smoke of the Opium War at Humen and the flashing swords and knives of the attack on the Governor-General's office in Guangdong... The sound was thunderous and piercing.

	Seventy-seven years of wind and rain, moonrise and sunset. Huanghuagang holds the eternal spirits of seventy-two heroic lives, a glorious and brilliant piece of history. The pine trees swayed in unison, perhaps in reverence for the spirits of the martyrs? The waves continued to roll, perhaps singing the heroic deeds of the martyrs?

	So, I silently stepped back from the archway and stood at a distance, gazing at the four large characters. They reminded me of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's dignified manner as he inscribed the characters, and his majestic presence as he presided over the completion ceremony of the mausoleum. I found myself unconsciously standing tall and stepping forward into the archway.

	A two-hundred-meter-long, ten-meter-wide stone path led directly to the mausoleum. The Statue of Liberty stood tall, holding a torch high above. A cluster of flowers, golden chrysanthemums, and red chrysanthemums formed a mushroom-like shape, surrounding the area like a burning flame. On both sides of the path, pines and cypresses stood tall and dense, neatly arranged. This was a symbol of the vibrant life that shines through the bloodshed. The path was straight, like the broad backs of the heroes bearing the weight of history, smoothing out the bumpy and winding road. Above it, bamboo shoots sprouted, and green grass grew thick, while people and vehicles flowed endlessly on the main road. The idea of examining history and traversing ancient and modern times arose spontaneously. A long scroll slowly unrolled before my eyes.

	On the day of the uprising's failure, seventy-two mutilated bodies lay here, comforted by the blue sky and white clouds during the day, and accompanied by the clear wind and bright moon at night. The tall pine trees leaned over the path, their branches reaching out as if bowing to the visitors. The fragrance of the flowers, carried by the sunlight, gently flowed down from the pine needles, as if greeting the visitors. Reflecting on that glorious but unfinished mission, the lone seeker truly wanted to take root in the yellow earth, standing straight like a pine tree, guarding the blooming flowers with the eternal sleepers.

	This was not mere sentimentality. From seed to forest, how difficult it is! Only the seeds sown seventy years ago, deeply rooted, breaking through the rocks and sprouting new shoots, could grow into sturdy trunks that withstand the wind and thunder, creating a dense and everlasting pine forest, layer upon layer, standing tall and firm.

	It was early morning, and there were few visitors in the cemetery. A slender young woman walked with a little girl. Two elderly men practiced Tai Chi, their movements as fluid as dragons dancing in a fairyland. Three girls in blue skirts and white shirts leaned against the memorial arch, chatting in English. And there was me, a wandering son seeking the teachings of my ancestors. Everything was so peaceful and harmonious. This world made me proud. I felt a sense of unity with my ancestors, as if we were sitting together, chatting intimately. Admiring the achievements of my ancestors also awakened in me the duty and mission to inherit their unfinished revolution.

	Beyond the treetops, Yuexiu Mountain stood in the distance, leaning against the vast sky, blurred and indistinct, like an ancient scroll. The world changes, and the stars shift, but history has forever marked April 27, 1911. In those days, how many heroes gathered under Dr. Sun Yat-sen's banner, fighting against feudalism, striving for freedom, and building a republic. They devoted their hearts and souls, rising early and working late, their voices echoing in the valleys, and their efforts plowing through the hard earth. Finally, at that moment, they blew the conch shell as a signal, and eight hundred heroes, armed with swords and guns, charged forward, one after another, towards the Governor-General's office. Although the uprising failed due to the disparity in forces and the mistaken friendly fire, the sound of the guns marked the beginning of the end of the two-thousand-year-old feudal wall. The revolutionaries were martyred, and the heroes were buried. What was once a desolate wilderness is now a martyrs' cemetery. The yellow flowers and green pines are all thanks to the seventy-two heroes who shed their blood. The tall trees standing in the cemetery are all thanks to the land that nurtured countless outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. The heroes' deeds are deeply engraved on the earth. Guangzhou has the solemn and majestic Huanghuagang, the green stone carvings of the dragon, and a monument to the spirit of the Chinese nation, standing tall and proud!

	An archway, a boundary. Inside, the righteous spirit endures. Looking around, the sky is low and dark, the birds are silent, and the visitors have all left. It is time to go. The cemetery is not lonely, I believe. The spirits of the martyrs live on, silently watching over the changes on this land. The people on this land, who share the same breath and destiny with them, will forever remember them, remember the bloodshed, remember the hardships of the revolution, and remember the blood they shed for the construction of a democratic, free, prosperous, and flourishing China.

	I walked out of the cemetery. My slow steps could not hide the weight in my heart. Clearly, I saw Dr. Sun Yat-sen coming towards me, dignified and spirited, his words echoing like a bell:

	"The revolution is not yet successful, comrades still need to strive!"

	"Ally with Russia, ally with the Communists, support the workers and peasants."

	Dr. Sun's blood is still warm, his ambition unfulfilled. His words are not just about the unfinished mission, but also about the awakening of history!

	Only the Communist Party can save China!

	Only socialism can save China!

	So, my heart opened wide. Stepping out of the archway, I looked back at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's inscription: "Haoqi Changcun!" The setting sun shone on it, making it even more brilliant and awakening!

	It is the fiery spirit of the Chinese people, a people with blood, integrity, and wisdom...

    谒黄花岗
    庞俭克
    那是厚重巍峨的石砌牌楼。置身其下，我蓦然觉得自我细微得宛若纤尘，飘飘然失却了重量，被巨大的磁力牢牢吸附在粗壮的石柱旁，不能旁移，也无从挪动。牌楼正门“浩气长存”金碧辉煌的楷书大字，蓝湛湛的晴天衬映着刚劲的笔锋，便有浩然正气凛凛涌动，阳刚之力震慑灵肉。
    簇拥着牌坊的青松在艳艳的红日下森森地扶摇。
    支撑起牌坊的土地在姚黄紫姹的花丛中沉沉地起伏。
    阵风徐来，天地间松涛瑟瑟。仿佛有滚滚涛声唤醒的由远而近轻轻搏动的厚重的地声隐隐而来。那支亘古不灭的混声合唱曲，宏亮昂扬的男声领唱，委婉轻柔的女声伴唱，嘶哑的是老声，清朗的是童音，宏大沉重，交织迸发。歌声中清晰所见虎门销烟的白雾翻滚，进攻两广总督府的剑影刀光……大音镗镗，如雷贯耳。
    七十七年风来雨去，月落日出。黄花岗凝固着七十二个伟烈的生命，永恒着一段辉煌灿烂的历史。松阵连连起伏，可是景仰烈士们的英灵？涛声不断不止，可是歌唱英灵们的壮举凛然？
    于是默默退出牌楼，站在远处景仰那四个大字。这令人想见中山先生研墨挥毫题字的威仪，主持陵墓落成大典的雄姿，便身不由己昂首阔步迈进牌楼。
    一条长二百余米宽丈余的石砌墓道，直接墓台。自由神像高擎火炬，耸立林表。锦簇的花团，金灿灿的黄菊涌起蘑菇状的圆形造型，环绕四周的红菊如燃烧的火焰。墓道两侧，松柏苍苍，竹林青翠，密密浓浓的整齐列阵。这是辉映碧血的生机勃勃的生命象征。墓道平直，俨然英灵们宽厚的脊背承起历史的重负，填平那段凸凹不平曲折坎坷的长路，其上便有了翠竹的拔节，碧草的凝茵以及通衢大道上来往如织的人流和车流。检校历史，纵横古今的意念油然而生。一幅长卷便在眼前慢慢地卷开。
    发难失败之日，七十二具折臂破脑血肉模糊的遗骸就在这里长眠，昼有蓝天白云抚慰，夜有清风明月作伴。那高高的松树队列，嶙峋的枝桠尽向墓道斜斜地俯伏，花香依着阳光从针叶间静静地淌下，宛若向后来者鞠躬致意。凝思缅怀那一段虽然壮烈却未竟的事业，踽踽独行的寻觅者也真想扎根于黄土地中，站成一棵棵笔直的松树，与长眠者守望着鲜花在一夜春风中美丽地开放。
    这决非自作多情。从种子到森林是何等的艰难！唯有七十多年前播洒的种子，深深地扎下根须，顶翻磐石绽放新芽，才有风吹不倒雷劈不折的硬朗躯干，才有浓浓郁郁生生不息的松涛滚滚，才有密密厚厚层层叠叠的松阵巍然。
    正是清晨，陵园游人稀少。一位身段窕窈的少妇牵着一小女孩散步。两位老叟在练太极拳，一招一式如鱼龙游转在仙境。三个着蓝裙白衬衣的女学生依在记功坊下用英语对话。还有我，一个大睁眼睛寻觅先人遗训的游子。一切都是那么宁静平和。这样的世界很使我骄傲。我有了一种同先辈们在一起促膝谈心时的交融感。仰慕着先人的业绩，亦唤起后来者承继先人遗愿完成未竟革命的义务和使命。
    透过林梢，越秀山在远远的天边斜倚苍茫，浓淡迷离，如同浑莽朴厚的原生画轴。世事沧桑，物换星移，历史永恒了一九一一年四月二十七日那一天。想当年多少英烈齐聚先生麾下，反封建，争自由，建共和，披肝沥胆，夙兴夜寐，蝉嘶寂谷，蚓耕坚泥，终于在那一刻吹螺为号，八百壮士提刀携枪前赴后继直扑两广都督署。虽因敌我力量悬殊，义党同人又因信号错误自相误射，事业终而未竟，然而武装起义的枪声，却为两千多年根深蒂固的封建大墙的坍塌敲响了丧钟。党人蒙难，义士营葬。昔日伏莽渊薮，今日烈士陵园。满地黄花青松，皆因七十二烈士捐洒碧血生色生辉。满园林表耸立，皆因土地孕育了无数中华民族的优秀子孙。烈士功绩，深深镌刻在大地上。广州便有庄严肃穆的黄花岗，便有青石透雕的青龙翻腾，便有一座中华民族魂魄的丰碑巍然耸立！
    一座牌楼，一条界限。楼内自有浩气长存。环顾四野，天低暮合，青鸟寂声，游人已尽。该离去了。陵园不寂寞吧？我相信。碑林生命不息，他们静穆地注视着这块土地上的变革。在这块土地上与他们同呼吸共命运的人们永远记得他们，记得血雨腥风，记得革命的艰辛，记得他们为建设民主、自由、繁荣昌盛的中国流尽的鲜血。
    我向陵园外走去。迟缓的脚步掩不住沉重。分明见孙中山先生迎面过来了，气宇轩昂，英姿焕发，谆谆教诲如警钟长鸣：
    “革命尚未成功，同志尚需努力！”
    “联俄，联共，扶助农工。”
    先生碧血尚热，壮志未酬，他的话岂止是未竟的事业，又何尝不是历史的觉醒！
    只有共产党才能救中国！
    只有社会主义才能救中国！
    于是心胸豁然。步出牌楼，犹回首孙中山先生题字：“浩气长存！”
    浩气长存！夕阳晖映其上，分外辉煌，分外警醒！
    是奋袂蹈厉的炎黄雄风，有血性有节气有智慧的中华刚烈男儿呵……
