The growth rate of the national economy, especially in industry and agriculture, must maintain a reasonable proportion with the growth rate of primary energy. This is the fundamental condition for achieving a basic balance between energy supply and demand.

Fully leveraging China's relatively abundant coal resources, increasing investment, and accelerating coal development; fire power generation must be arranged around saving coal and transportation capacity, while accelerating hydropower development; the petroleum and natural gas industries must focus on "increasing reserves and production," with increasing reserves being the most urgent task; developing nuclear power is an important step in solving the energy problems of China's eastern coastal regions in the future.

To effectively carry out the rectification and adjustment, more than 90% of the effort should be focused on tapping the potential within the energy industry.

The decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, including this year, is to basically complete the task of rectifying and adjusting the national economy within three years or a bit longer. As a key basic industry, how the energy industry can be strengthened and steadily developed through rectification and adjustment and deepening reform is of great significance in promoting the national economy to develop in a sustained, stable, and coordinated manner. I would like to share a few thoughts on this issue and discuss them with everyone.

First, the development speed of energy must be in line with the development speed of the national economy.

Since the second half of last year, China's energy supply has been generally tight. Is this due to a decline in energy production? No. In fact, the energy production situation in 1988 and 1989 was very good, especially for coal and electricity production, which not only did not decline but also grew rapidly. In 1988, the national raw coal production reached 9.8 billion tons, an increase of 5.6% over the previous year (the growth rate in 1986 and 1987 was around 3%); the national electricity generation reached 545 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 9.6% over the previous year, continuing the high growth rate of approximately 10% per year in the first two years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan. This year, energy production continues to grow. By the end of November, the national raw coal production reached 9.2 billion tons, an increase of more than 70 million tons over the same period last year, a growth of 10.1%; electricity generation, which was basically the same as the same period last year in the first quarter, gradually increased in the following quarters, reaching 525.7 billion kilowatt-hours by the end of November, an increase of 6.9% over the same period last year. It is estimated that the raw coal production this year will definitely exceed 10 billion tons, and the electricity generation will reach more than 570 billion kilowatt-hours, both of which will exceed the state plan and achieve the Seventh Five-Year Plan targets one year ahead of schedule. The production of petroleum and natural gas will also complete the state plan.

The reason why the energy production situation was good in the past two years is that the central and state leaders paid attention to and supported the energy industry, and relevant departments and local governments cooperated with each other. The cadres and workers on the energy front played the role of the working class as masters, cared for the country's difficulties, and worked hard to increase production. Especially at the critical moment when disturbances and counter-revolutionary riots occurred in Beijing and some regions, the broad masses of workers on the energy front were able to guard their posts and perform their duties, showing a high level of political awareness and ensuring the normal operation of energy production. The reform of the system, the expansion of enterprise autonomy, and the mobilization of enthusiasm on all sides have promoted production.

Since the energy production situation is so good, why is the energy supply still so tight? The fundamental reason lies in macroeconomic control and disproportionate development. Domestic and international experience over many years has shown that the growth rate of the national economy, especially in industry and agriculture, must maintain a reasonable proportion with the growth rate of primary energy (generally expressed by the "elasticity coefficient"). This is the basic condition for achieving a basic balance between energy supply and demand. Most experts believe that in periods of relatively high economic growth, the elasticity coefficient of primary energy should reach 0.5 or more, and the elasticity coefficient of electricity should be at least 1 or more. In the first three years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the elasticity coefficients of primary energy and electricity were 0.26 and 0.67, respectively, both far below the required levels, making energy supply tight inevitable. Therefore, to fundamentally alleviate the contradiction between energy supply and demand, it is necessary to decide during this rectification and adjustment to correct the serious disproportions between the energy industry and other industries. According to the plan, by the year 2000, the production of primary energy will be 1.4 billion tons of standard coal, with an average annual growth rate of about 3.5% over the next ten years, and the growth rate of the total industrial and agricultural output value can only be arranged at 7%. The growth rate of electricity should reach more than 7%. In the future national economic planning, the growth rates of energy and the national economy should rise and fall together. If the corresponding energy growth rate target is not achieved in the previous year, adjustments should be made in the second year. Otherwise, the small disproportions accumulated over many years will become large disproportions, and ultimately, a forced major economic adjustment will have to be made, resulting in huge losses on all sides. Therefore, I think it is still necessary to emphasize planning and proportionality, which may be more scientific than generally advocating for a "tilted policy."

Second, based on China's national conditions, adopt a correct energy development strategy and policy.

China's energy resources that can truly be considered abundant are coal, with proven reserves of over 860 billion tons, and hydropower, with exploitable hydropower resources of 380 million kilowatts. However, the distribution of China's energy resources is extremely uneven, with relatively few energy resources in the economically developed eastern regions; the per capita resource ownership is low; development funds are seriously insufficient; due to backward technology and management, the energy utilization rate is very low. These are the basic advantages and disadvantages of China's energy, and the basic national conditions of energy.

After the establishment of the Energy Department, we have studied and proposed the basic policies, strategies, and measures for the medium and short-term development of the energy industry based on the above national conditions and the requirements of achieving the second-step goal of economic development by the end of this century. The basic idea is:

Fully leverage China's relatively abundant coal resources, increase investment, and accelerate coal development. In terms of layout, first, focus on developing coal in the "three western" regions of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western Inner Mongolia, especially the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield with reserves of over 200 billion tons. The key is to quickly open up the coal transportation channels in this region. Second, accelerate the development of brown coal in the "four eastern" regions and coal in eastern Heilongjiang and Liaoning, and reduce the amount of coal transported from the interior to the east, freeing up coal and transportation capacity for the eastern and southern regions. Third, strengthen the development of coal in eastern regions such as Shandong, Anhui, and Henan Yongcheng, as well as in Yunnan and Guizhou, to reduce the transportation of coal from west to east and from north to south. Fourth, prioritize the development of large open-pit coal mines, while strengthening the technical transformation of existing mines, significantly improving the mechanization level of mining and excavation to make up for the decline of old mines, and improving labor productivity and safety levels. Fifth, local coal mines account for more than half of the production, and it is necessary to strengthen industry management, focus on rectification and transformation, and ensure the healthy development of this "half of the sky." We do not advocate individual mining.

The construction of thermal power plants should be arranged around saving coal and transportation capacity. In the future, all new thermal power plants must use high-parameter, high-efficiency large units, develop supercritical units, and gradually phase out medium and low-pressure small units and overdue units to save a lot of coal. Actively develop pithead power plants, implement coal-electricity joint operations, and change coal transportation to power transmission. At the same time, accelerate the development of hydropower to reduce the pressure on coal development and railway transportation. In terms of layout, first, focus on the construction of large hydropower stations on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the main and tributaries of the Yangtze River, the Red River, and the Lancang River; second, in regions with poor energy but good hydropower resources, quickly build a number of medium-sized hydropower stations.

The petroleum and natural gas industries must focus on "increasing reserves and production," with increasing reserves being the most urgent task. Stabilize the old oilfields in the east and vigorously explore and develop the western oilfields. Offshore oil must continue to cooperate with foreign countries in exploration and development while strengthening self-operated exploration.

Developing nuclear power is an important step in solving the energy problems of China, especially the eastern coastal regions, in the future. This century, the main focus is on mastering the manufacturing technology of nuclear power equipment, basically achieving the domestic production and batch production of 600,000-kilowatt-level nuclear power equipment, and laying the foundation for accelerating the development of nuclear power in the early 21st century.

To achieve the above development strategy and the development goals by the end of this century, one of the keys is to increase investment in the energy industry. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently emphasized that investment in energy and other basic industries must be strengthened, "and it must be maintained for 10 to 20 years, even if it means borrowing money." To this end, on the one hand, the state should adjust the investment direction according to industrial policies and increase investment in the energy industry as much as possible; on the other hand, continue to implement the policy of collective investment in energy, establish a coal construction fund, and improve the methods for power and petroleum construction funds. Encourage coal, power, and petroleum enterprises to use more foreign capital. Gradually rationalize energy prices, reverse the situation of universal losses in energy enterprises, and enhance the vitality of the energy industry.

Third, during the rectification and adjustment, more than 90% of the effort should be focused on tapping internal potential.

Undoubtedly, during this rectification and adjustment, the energy industry is a basic industry that needs to be strengthened and accelerated. It is necessary to seek increased investment from all sides. Without money, coal mines, power plants, and oilfields cannot be built. However, it must be seen that our country is still relatively poor, with limited financial resources, and it is not realistic to rely on the state to significantly increase investment. Therefore, our starting point should be to "look inward and tap potential," focusing on managing and using the existing funds, equipment, manpower, and material resources, and doing everything possible to improve labor productivity and economic benefits, tapping the potential within the energy industry and enterprises.

The energy industry, like other industrial sectors, has a fairly large foundation after 40 years of construction and development, and there is considerable potential in all aspects. As science and technology develop rapidly and people's understanding of objective reality deepens, new potential will continue to be discovered. If we seriously examine it, we will see that there are different degrees of waste in planning, design, construction, technology, production management, and the use of funds and talents in all aspects. The waste in some aspects is astonishing. Not to mention compared with advanced countries, even within the country, advanced enterprises compared with backward enterprises, there are significant differences in labor productivity, material consumption, and construction periods in all aspects. These wastes and differences are the real potential. There are many examples of this:

In the coal industry, in 1988, the average full-time efficiency of national coal mines was 1.092 tons per worker, with the highest being 4.72 tons in Jincheng Mining Bureau in Shanxi, while 30% of the mining bureaus were below 1 ton; the average annual coal production of national coal mines' comprehensive mechanized mining teams was 5.2 million tons, with the highest being 18 million tons and the lowest being only about 2 million tons, not even reaching the production of high-grade ordinary mining. Among the new mines and expanded mines put into production since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there are still more than 50 million tons that have not reached their designed capacity, and so on.

In the power industry, a 1 million-kilowatt-level thermal power plant in China generally requires 2,000 to 3,000 people, while the relatively advanced HuaNeng Dalian Power Plant (700,000 kilowatts) in the country only requires about 500 people; the average coal consumption of domestically produced 200,000-kilowatt units is 394 grams of standard coal, with the lowest being 364 grams of standard coal; due to equipment defects, poor management, and other reasons, hundreds of millions of kilowatts of the existing thermal power plants in the country have not reached their rated capacity; and so on.

In planning and design, there are many places that are not economically reasonable. For example, in regions covered by large power grids, a large number of small thermal power plants with high unit kilowatt construction costs, high coal consumption, and environmental pollution have been built. As for designs that do not consider national conditions and strength and adopt overly high and foreign standards, there are no shortage of examples.

In basic construction, the phenomena of long construction periods and high costs are widespread. For example, a certain power plant in Beijing, with an installed capacity of 600,000 kilowatts and an estimated investment of 540 million yuan, may need to double to be sufficient. Although there are factors of price increases, there is indeed obvious waste. On the contrary, some projects that are not prioritized, due to careful calculation, are done quickly and economically. For example, the Ningxia Lingwu Coal Mine first built two small pits, which were then connected to form a large pit, and coal was produced while the pits were being built; the Shennu Daliuta Coal Mine, with a scale of 30 million tons, can be completed in three years, with an investment of less than 100 yuan per ton of coal, and can produce 120 million tons of coal next year. The construction period for 200,000 and 300,000 kilowatt units of thermal power plants, from start to power generation, generally takes 36 months, while the fastest can be done in 24 months; the Xinanjiang Hydropower Station built in the early 1960s, with an installed capacity of 600,000 kilowatts, had the first unit put into operation in three years, while now it generally takes 6 to 8 years; a 100-million-ton-level large coal mine can be completed and put into operation in 40 months if done quickly, while it can take 8 to 9 years or even more than 10 years if done slowly.

From the above examples, it is not difficult to see how much potential we have! To tap this potential, after the establishment of the Energy Department, we have focused on this aspect of work. For example, last year, we proposed to shorten the construction period of energy projects as a breakthrough to use the existing funds well, held a meeting in Zou County, Shandong, and formulated some methods and measures. The main focus is to emphasize the preparation work, and projects that are not well-prepared will not be started; once started, it is necessary to ensure that funds, materials, and equipment are "full," and organize elite teams to work continuously. This year, we have focused on improving the health level of existing thermal power plants and carried out the "safe, civilized production to achieve level standards" activity to achieve safe, full, and stable power generation. The focus is to help improve the rectification and adjustment of key enterprises. The bureaus and provincial bureaus have jointly focused on 21 power plants, and the Energy Department has directly focused on 7 large power plants. The foreman is the direct commander on the production front line, and the quality of the foreman plays a decisive role in safe production and labor efficiency. We have carried out a trial of strengthening the command on the production front line at the Xiaonan Mine of the Tiefa Mining Bureau. We have also focused on the Yimin Coal-Electricity Joint Operation Project, ensuring quality from the planning and design stages, and so on. The difference between focusing and not focusing is huge. Now, in terms of shortening the construction period, coal mines and thermal power plants have set examples, such as the No. 1 pit of the Santaizi Mine of the Tiefa Mining Bureau, which can be completed and put into operation in 40 months; the 300,000-kilowatt domestically produced unit of the Zou County Power Plant in Shandong can be completed and put into operation in 26 months; the first unit of the Hanchuan Power Plant in Hubei can also basically achieve 24 months of grid-connected power generation. The rectification and adjustment of existing thermal power plants have also achieved significant results. The Jiangsu Jianpi Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 1.625 million kilowatts, is the largest thermal power plant in the country, with an average of only 600,000 to 700,000 kilowatts of output in the past; the Shanxi Shentou Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 1.3 million kilowatts, had 6 out of 8 units that could not operate at the most. After focused help, the staff of the two plants were inspired, and with the same team and equipment, the situation changed in a few months. Now, the output of the Jianpi Power Plant has reached 1.2 million kilowatts, and the Shentou Power Plant has also reached 1 million kilowatts.

Practice has proven that tapping the internal potential of the energy industry, improving efficiency and benefits, is not only very necessary but also completely possible. The Fifth Plenary Session emphasized that economic work must be firmly shifted to the track of focusing on improving economic benefits, making great efforts to improve management, improve technological levels, emphasize economic benefits, establish a strict accounting system, and take the path of low input, high output, and high benefits. As long as we seriously implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, carry out rectification and adjustment, deepen reform, and work hard on managing and using the existing manpower, funds, and materials, fully mobilize the masses, significantly improve labor productivity and economic benefits, and let the potential be fully utilized, the energy industry will definitely be strengthened and gradually develop in a sustained and stable manner.

    在治理整顿中切实加强能源工业
    黄毅诚
    △国民经济特别是工农业增长速度与一次能源的增长速度之间，必须有个合理的比例，这是求得能源供需大体平衡的基本条件。
    △充分发挥我国煤炭资源比较丰富的优势，增加投入，加快煤炭开发；火电建设要紧紧围绕节约煤炭和运力来安排，同时，要加快水电开发；石油、天然气工业要抓紧“增储上产”，增加储量是当务之急；发展核电是今后解决我国东部沿海地区能源问题的重要步骤。
    △搞好治理整顿，要把90％以上的精力用于挖掘能源工业内部潜力。
    党的十三届五中全会决定，包括今年在内，用三年或者更长一些时间，基本完成国民经济的治理整顿任务。能源工业作为重要的基础产业之一，如何通过治理整顿和深化改革，使之得到切实加强和稳定发展，对于促进国民经济转上持续稳定协调发展的轨道，具有重要意义。我就这个问题谈几点看法，和大家研究。
    一、能源发展速度要与国民经济发展速度相适应
    去年下半年以来，我国能源供应全面紧张。是能源生产下降造成的吗？不是。实际上，去年和今年的能源生产形势都很好，特别是煤炭、电力生产不但没有滑坡，而且增长很快。1988年全国原煤产量达到9.8亿吨，比上年增长5.6％（1986、1987年增长率为3％左右）；全国发电量达到5450亿千瓦小时，比上年增长9.6％，继续保持了“七五”头两年年均增长约10％的高速度。今年以来，能源生产继续增长。到11月底累计，全国原煤产量达到9.2亿吨，比去年同期增加7000多万吨，增长10.1％；电力生产在一季度与去年同期基本持平的情况下，后来逐季上升，到11月底全国累计发电5257亿千瓦小时，比去年同期增长6.9％。预计今年原煤产量肯定突破10亿吨，发电量达到5700亿千瓦小时以上，将双双超额完成国家计划，提前一年实现“七五”计划指标。石油、天然气生产也能完成国家计划。
    这两年能源生产所以能够取得好成绩，一是由于中央和国务院领导同志对能源工业的重视和支持，有关部门和地方政府的协作配合。二是能源战线的干部、职工发挥工人阶级的主人翁责任感，体贴国家困难，努力增加生产。特别在北京和一些地区发生动乱和反革命暴乱的关键时刻，能源战线的广大职工都能坚守岗位，恪尽职守，表现出高度的政治觉悟，保证了能源生产的正常进行。三是体制改革，扩大企业自主权，调动了各方面的积极性，促进了生产。
    既然这两年能源生产形势很好，为什么能源供应还是如此紧张？根本原因在于宏观失控，比例失调。国内外多年的经验证明，国民经济特别是工农业的增长速度与一次能源的增长速度之间，必须有个合理的比例（一般用“弹性系数”来表示），这是求得能源供需大体平衡的基本条件。多数专家认为，在经济发展速度比较高的时期，一次能源弹性系数应达到0.5以上，电力弹性系数最低要达到1以上。“七五”前3年，一次能源和电力的弹性系数分别为0.26和0.67，都远远低于要求，能源供应紧张是必然的。因此，要从根本上缓解能源的供需矛盾，必须在这次治理整顿中，下决心把能源工业和其他工业严重失调的比例调整过来。按照规划，到2000年一次能源产量为14亿吨标准煤，今后十年年均增长率只有3.5％左右，工农业总产值增长率只能按7％安排，电力的增长率应达到7％以上。在今后国民经济计划的安排上，能源与国民经济的增长率应按上述比例同升同降，如果前一年未达到相应的能源增长率指标，第二年就应进行小的调整。否则，多年积累下来的小失调变成大失调，最终还得被迫进行经济大调整，那样各方面的损失就太大了。所以我认为，还是要讲有计划、按比例，这比一般地讲采取“倾斜政策”或许更科学一些。
    二、从我国国情出发，采取正确的能源发展战略和政策
    我国能源资源真正算得上丰富的，一是煤炭，目前探明储量达8600多亿吨；二是水力，可开发的水电资源有3.8亿千瓦。但是，我国能源资源的地域分布极不均衡，东部经济发达地区能源资源较少；人均占有的资源量少；开发资金严重不足；由于技术、管理落后，能源利用率很低。这就是我国能源的基本优势和劣势，是能源方面的基本国情。
    能源部成立后，我们从上述国情出发，按照到本世纪末实现经济发展战略第二步目标的要求，研究提出了中近期能源工业的基本方针、发展战略和政策、措施。基本思路是：
    ——充分发挥我国煤炭资源比较丰富的优势，增加投入，加快煤炭开发。在布局上，一是把开发山西、陕西、内蒙古西部“三西”地区的煤炭作为全国重点，特别是神府东胜煤田，储量2000多亿吨。关键是要抓紧开辟把这一地区的煤运出来的运煤大通道。二是要加快东四盟的褐煤以及黑龙江东部和辽宁的煤炭开发，不再多增加从关内运煤，腾出关内煤炭和运力保华东、华南。三是强化山东、安徽和河南永城等东部地区以及云、贵等地的煤炭开发，尽可能减少西煤东运和北煤南运。四是优先开发大型露天煤矿，同时加强现有矿井的技术改造，把采掘机械化水平大大提高一步，以弥补老矿衰减，提高劳动生产率和安全水平。五是地方煤矿产量已占一半以上，要切实加强行业管理，抓好整顿、改造，使这个“半边天”健康发展。我们不主张个体办矿。
    ——火电建设要紧紧围绕节约煤炭和运力来安排。今后新建火电厂都必须采用高参数、高效率大机组，发展超临界机组，逐步淘汰中低压小机组和超期服役机组，以大力节约煤炭。要积极发展坑口电站，实行煤电联营，变运煤为输电。同时要加快水电开发，以减轻煤炭开发和铁路运输的压力。在布局上，一是抓好黄河上游、长江干支流、红水河及澜沧江等大型水电站的建设；二是在缺能而水电资源条件好的地区抢建一批中型水电站。
    ——石油、天然气工业要抓紧“增储上产”，增加储量尤其是当务之急。要稳住东部老油田，大力勘探开发西部油区。海上石油要在继续对外合作勘探开发的同时，加强自营勘探。
    ——发展核电，是今后解决我国首先是东部沿海地区能源问题的重要步骤。本世纪内主要是掌握核电设备的制造技术，基本实现60万千瓦级核电设备的国产化、批量化生产，为下个世纪初加快发展核电打下基础。
    要实现上述发展战略和到本世纪末的发展目标，关键之一是要增加对能源工业的投入。小平同志最近曾强调指出，要加强能源等基础工业的投资，“要坚持10年到20年，宁肯欠债，也要加强”。为此，一方面国家要按照产业政策，调整投资方向，尽可能增加对能源工业的投入；另一方面，要继续推行大家集资办能源的政策，建立煤炭建设基金，完善电力、石油建设基金办法。要鼓励煤炭、电力、石油企业多利用外资。要逐步理顺能源价格，扭转能源企业普遍亏损的局面，增强能源工业的活力。
    三、搞好治理整顿，用90％以上的精力挖掘内部潜力
    毫无疑问，在这次治理整顿中，能源工业属于需要大力加强、加快发展的基础产业，多方争取增加投资是必要的。没有钱，煤矿、电站、油田建不起来。但是要看到，我们国家还比较穷，财力有限，要想靠国家大量增加投资是不现实的。因此，我们的立足点应当放在“眼睛向内，挖掘潜力”上，下功夫管好用好已有的资金、设备、人力、物力等条件，千方百计提高劳动生产率和经济效益，把能源各行业内部和企业内部的潜力挖掘出来。各级领导都要把90％以上的精力用在这方面，把广大职工群众的积极性引导到内部挖潜、提高效益和效率上来。
    能源工业和其他工业部门一样，经过40年的建设和发展，已经有了一个相当大的基础，各方面都蕴藏着相当大的潜力。科学技术在迅速发展，人们对客观的认识在不断深化，还会不断发现新的潜力。只要我们认真检查一下就会看到，无论在规划布局、设计施工、技术装备、生产管理、资金和人才运用等方面，都不同程度地存在着浪费现象，有些方面的浪费是惊人的。不用说同先进国家相比，就是国内先进企业与后进企业相比，在劳动生产率、物质消耗、建设工期等方面，都有很大的差距。这些浪费和差距就是现实的潜力。这方面的例子很多：
    煤炭工业，1988年全国统配煤矿全员效率平均每工1.092吨，最高的山西晋城矿务局为4.72吨，而有30％的矿务局在1吨以下；全国统配矿综采队平均年产煤52万吨，最高的180万吨，最低的才20万吨左右，还赶不上高档普采的产量。“六五”以来投产的新井和改扩建井中，至今尚有5000多万吨未达到设计能力，等等。
    电力工业，百万千瓦级的火电厂，我国一般要用二三千人，而目前国内较先进的华能大连电厂（70万千瓦）只用500多人；国产20万千瓦机组供电煤耗平均394克标准煤，最低为364克标准煤；全国现有火电厂因设备缺陷、管理不善等原因，没有达到额定出力的以数百万千瓦计；等等。
    在规划设计方面，有许多不够经济合理的地方。例如在大电网所及的地区兴建了大量凝汽式小火电厂，单位千瓦造价高、煤耗高，又污染环境。至于设计上不顾国情国力，采用过高过洋的标准，更不乏其例。
    在基本建设方面，工期长、造价高的现象普遍存在。例如北京某电厂，装机60万千瓦，概算投资5.4亿元，现在恐怕要翻一番才够。尽管其中有物价因素的影响，但也确实有明显的浪费。相反，有些排不上重点的工程，由于注意精打细算，搞得又快又省。如宁夏灵武煤矿，先建两个小井，以后再连起来形成一个大井，并且边建井边产煤；神木大柳塔煤矿，300万吨规模，三年就能建成，吨煤投资不到100元，明年即可产煤120万吨。火电厂20万、30万千瓦机组的建设工期，从开工到投产发电一般要36个月，干得快的只要24个月；六十年代初建设的新安江水电站，装机60万千瓦，第一台机组三年投产，现在一般要6—8年；百万吨级的大煤矿，快的40个月建成投产，慢的要八九年、十多年。
    从上述例子不难看出，我们的潜力有多大！为了把这些潜力挖出来，能源部成立后，我们就注意抓了这方面的工作。例如，去年我们提出把缩短能源工程的建设周期，作为用好现有资金的突破口，在山东邹县开了现场会，制定了一些办法、措施。主要是强调做好前期准备工作，没有准备好的项目坚决不开工；一旦开工就要保证资金、材料、设备“吃饱”，组织精兵强将连续施工。今年，我们着手抓现有火电厂提高设备健康水平，开展“安全、文明生产创水平达标”活动，实现安全满发稳发。重点是帮助抓好骨干企业的治理整顿。各网局、省局共抓了21个电厂，能源部直接抓7个大电厂。班长是生产第一线的直接指挥者，班长的素质如何，对安全生产、劳动效率都起到决定性的作用。我们在铁法矿务局的晓南矿进行了强化生产第一线指挥的试点。我们还抓了伊敏煤电联营项目，从规划设计上把好关等等。抓与不抓就是大不一样。现在，在缩短建设工期方面，煤矿、火电厂都有了样板，如铁法矿务局的三台子一号井，40个月就能建成投产；山东邹县电厂国产30万千瓦机组，26个月就建成发电；湖北汉川电厂第一台机组也基本能做到24个月并网发电。现有火电厂的治理整顿也有显著成效。江苏谏壁电厂，装机162.5万千瓦，是全国最大的火电厂，过去平均只有六七十万千瓦出力；山西神头电厂装机130万千瓦，过去8台机组最多时有6台不能运转。经过重点帮助，两厂职工振奋精神，还是原班人马、设备，几个月时间就变了样。现在谏壁电厂的出力已达120万千瓦，神头电厂也发100万千瓦。
    实践证明，能源工业挖掘内部潜力，提高效益和效率，不仅是十分必要的，而且是完全可能的。五中全会强调指出，要坚定不移地把经济工作转到以提高经济效益为中心的轨道上来，下大功夫改进经营管理，提高科技水平，讲求经济效益，建立严格的核算制度，走投入少、产出多、效益高的经济发展路子。只要我们认真贯彻五中全会精神，搞好治理整顿、深化改革，扎扎实实地在管好用好现有的人、财、物上下功夫，充分发动群众，把劳动生产率和经济效益大大提高一步，让潜力充分发挥出来，能源工业就一定能够得到切实的加强，逐步走上持续稳定发展的轨道。
