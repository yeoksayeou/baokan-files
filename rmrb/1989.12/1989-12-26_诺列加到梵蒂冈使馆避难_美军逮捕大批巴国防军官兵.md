	Noriega Seeks Refuge in Vatican Embassy
	U.S. Forces Arrest Large Number of Panamanian Defense Officials

	WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) — Reporters Cang Lide and Guo Weicheng report: Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian Defense Forces commander who has been pursued by U.S. forces, sought refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama this afternoon. It is reported that U.S. forces have surrounded the Vatican embassy with heavy troops.

	Upon learning the news, President Bush expressed his joy that Noriega's "terrorist regime has come to an end." White House spokesman Fitzwater stated that the United States is considering how to bring Noriega to the United States for trial. However, local sources believe that the Vatican authorities may extradite Noriega to the Panamanian government, which would frustrate the main purpose of the U.S. invasion of Panama—to capture Noriega and bring him to the United States for trial. Endara, who took office as Panama's president five days ago, has clearly stated that, according to the Panamanian constitution, he has no authority to extradite any Panamanian citizen to a foreign country.

	It is reported that Noriega arrived at the Vatican embassy in a private car. Previously, U.S. forces had searched his hiding place based on a tip-off.

	The total number of U.S. troops in Panama has now reached 26,000. In the five days of military operations, 30 U.S. soldiers have been killed, more than 200 wounded, and 4 missing; several American hostages are still in the hands of Panamanian soldiers.

	In recent days, U.S. forces have seized approximately 12,000 guns, a batch of surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank rockets, and other weapons from various military bases and prisoners. Among the high-ranking Panamanian Defense Force officers wanted by the U.S., three former brigade commanders surrendered today. The "self-defense forces" organized by the new government are searching house by house for former "Dignity Battalion" members. Approximately 1,600 lower-ranking Defense Force officers and more than 6,000 soldiers have been captured by U.S. forces.

    诺列加到梵蒂冈使馆避难
    美军逮捕大批巴国防军官兵
    本报华盛顿、墨西哥城12月24日电　记者仓立德、郭伟成报道：遭受美军追捕的巴拿马国防军司令诺列加将军今天下午前往梵蒂冈驻巴拿马使馆，要求政治避难。据悉，美军已派重兵包围了梵蒂冈使馆。
    布什总统得悉此消息后表示，他为诺列加的“恐怖统治已告结束”而高兴。白宫发言人菲茨沃特表示，美国正在考虑采取何种方式将诺列加带到美国接受审判。但此间人士认为，梵蒂冈当局有可能将诺列加递解巴拿马当局，这样一来，美国入侵巴拿马的主要目的——捉拿诺列加回美国受审，便要落空。5天前就任巴拿马总统的恩达拉已明确表示，根据巴宪法，他无权将任何巴拿马公民引渡至外国。
    据报道，诺列加是乘私人汽车前往梵蒂冈使馆的。此前美军曾根据告密搜查了他的隐匿地。
    目前在巴拿马的美军总数已达2.6万人，在5天的军事行动中，已有30名美军官兵阵亡，200余人受伤，4人失踪；另有数名美国人质仍在巴拿马军人手中。
    几天来，美军已经在各军事基地及俘虏中收缴了约12000支枪、一批地对空导弹、反坦克火箭等等。在美军通缉的前国防军高级军官中，今天有3名曾担任过军区司令的中校军官自首。新“政府”组织的“自卫队”正挨家挨户搜索原民兵“尊严营”人员。被美军捕获的国防军下级军官约有1600人，国防军士兵6000多人。
