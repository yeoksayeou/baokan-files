We are filled with joy as we extend our heartfelt congratulations to the first batch of senior technicians in our country. The evaluation and appointment of senior technical positions from the ranks of production-line workers is a full affirmation of the contributions made by millions of technical workers in the cause of socialist construction. It reflects the Party and the state's emphasis on the status and role of the working class, and their resolve to rely wholeheartedly on the working class.

Among the first batch of senior technicians, most are master craftsmen and innovators in their respective fields. They have persisted for decades on the production frontlines, not only possessing a high sense of responsibility but also rich practical experience and superb production skills. They have made outstanding achievements in ensuring the completion of production tasks and developing the national economy. Socialist modernization requires not only high-level scientific and technological and management talents but also a high-level production technical backbone team. Those who have emerged from long-term production practice as experts in their fields are equally indispensable important talents. Their wisdom and abilities should be respected by the whole society.

Our country is still in the primary stage of socialism, and the majority of labor in society is engaged in production labor on the frontlines. Establishing and improving the technician appointment system can guide the broad masses of workers to love their jobs, study their professions, and continuously improve their technical qualifications. It is also beneficial for our country's workforce to form a reasonable technical structure, adapting to the needs of economic construction. This is an important policy. As a socialist country led by the working class, we should create better conditions to open up career paths for the broad masses of workers, especially young workers, so that they can truly feel that being a worker is honorable and has a future and prospects.

Our economic construction faces many difficulties. Whether the current rectification and readjustment can achieve the expected results largely depends on the quality and work quality of the producers. We hope that technicians and senior technicians will play a leading role in their respective industries, continue to strive in their work, and pass on their exquisite skills and hardworking spirit to more young workers without reservation, making new contributions to the cause of socialist construction.

    值得尊重的宝贵人才
    本报评论员
    我们怀着喜悦的心情，向我国第一批高级技师表示热烈的祝贺。从生产第一线的工人中评聘高级技术职务，是对千百万技术工人在社会主义建设事业中所做贡献的充分肯定，体现了党和国家对工人阶级地位、作用的重视和全心全意依靠工人阶级的决心。
    首批高级技师中，大都是各自行业的能工巧匠、革新能手。他们十几年甚至几十年坚持在生产第一线，不仅有着高度的主人翁责任感，而且有着丰富的实践经验和高超的生产技艺，为保证完成生产任务和发展国民经济做出了优异的成绩。社会主义现代化建设，不仅需要有高水平的科学技术和管理人才，还必须有一支高水平的生产技术骨干队伍。那些在长期的生产实践中产生的行家里手，同样是不可缺少的重要人才，他们的智慧和才干，应当受到全社会的尊重。
    我国还处在社会主义初级阶段，社会劳动中的大多数在第一线从事生产劳动。建立和完善技师聘任制度能够引导广大工人热爱本职工作，钻研业务，不断提高技术素质，同时也有利于我国工人队伍形成合理的技术结构，适应经济建设的需要。这是一项重要政策。我国是工人阶级领导的社会主义国家，我们应该创造更好的条件，为广大工人开辟岗位成才的道路，使工人群众特别是青年工人切实感受到当工人是光荣的，有前途、有奔头的。
    我们的经济建设面临着许多困难。当前的治理整顿能否达到预期的目的，很大程度上取决于生产者的自身素质和工作质量。我们期望技师、高级技师们在各自的行业上切实发挥“带头人”的作用，在工作中不断进取，同时毫无保留地将精湛的技艺和艰苦奋斗的精神传授给更多的青年工人，为社会主义建设事业做出新的贡献。
