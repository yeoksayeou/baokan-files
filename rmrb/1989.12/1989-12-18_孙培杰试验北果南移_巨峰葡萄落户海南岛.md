	Sun Peijie Experiments with Moving Northern Fruits South:
	Giant Grape Varieties Settle in Hainan Island

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Xia Kai Xuan and our reporter Luo Zi Su report from Haikou: People have long believed that grapes cannot be grown in Hainan Island. However, Sun Peijie, the "Grape King" from Shandong, has successfully cultivated "Giant Grape" varieties that are purple with a reddish hue, sweet, and juicy on the southern island of our motherland.

	Sun Peijie, who is now 44 years old, began planting grapes in his hometown of Wangcheng Town, Laixi County, Shandong Province in the early 1970s. Over the past decade, he has developed a comprehensive set of scientific methods for cultivating grapes and various fruit trees, earning him the title of "Grape King." To fulfill his long-held ambition of moving northern fruits south, Sun Peijie visited Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hainan three times last year, ultimately selecting Qiongshan County in Hainan as his experimental base. In October of last year, he invested 200,000 yuan to lease 11 acres of barren land in Shishan Town. He also brought four farmers from Shandong, and after two months of hard work, they transformed the barren land into an orchard, planting 6 acres of grapes, 1 acre of strawberries, and a batch of peach and plum trees. The grapes Sun Peijie is experimenting with in Hainan not only grow quickly but also thrive. Northern grapes typically yield two harvests a year, while in Hainan, they can yield three harvests a year.

    孙培杰试验北果南移
    巨峰葡萄落户海南岛
    本报海口12月17日电　新华社记者夏凯旋、本报记者罗自苏报道：以往人们都说海南岛种不了葡萄。然而，来自山东的“葡萄大王”孙培杰，却在祖国的南岛上种出了一串串紫里透红、甘甜多汁的“巨峰葡萄”。
    今年44 岁的孙培杰70年代初便在老家山东莱西县望城镇栽种葡萄。十几年来他研究出了一整套栽培葡萄及各种果木的科学方法，被誉为“葡萄大王”。为了实现北果南移的夙愿，去年孙培杰三下广州、深圳、海南考察，最后选定海南琼山县作为试验基地。去年10月，他毅然投资20万元，在石山镇租下11亩荒地，又从山东带来4个农民，经过两个月的苦战，把这片荒地整成了果园，种上6亩葡萄，一亩草莓及一批桃、李树。孙培杰在海南试种的葡萄不仅长得快，而且长得好。北方的葡萄一年收二茬，而海南一年可以收三茬。
