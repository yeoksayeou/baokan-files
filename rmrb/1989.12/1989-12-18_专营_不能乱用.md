"专营" Cannot Be Misused

Liú Yùwén

The December 12th edition of "Today's Discussion" titled "Do Not Use '专营' to Be Arbitrary" criticized the "official merchant" attitude of some agricultural and sideline product procurement departments, aiming to protect the legitimate rights of farmers. The intention is good. The phenomena criticized in the article do exist in some regions and should be taken seriously and corrected resolutely. However, it is incorrect to generalize these problems as "专营," and it is necessary to clarify this because "专营" has a specific meaning.

Last October, in response to the issues of multiple entities interfering and reselling fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films—three crucial agricultural production materials that were in short supply—the State Council decided that starting from January 1st this year, the state would entrust the Ministry of Commerce's China Agricultural Production Materials Company and the agricultural production materials business units of various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives to implement specialized management of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films. Other departments, units, and individuals are strictly prohibited from trading these commodities. For products like color televisions, the state has also made similar specialized management regulations. However, there are no such regulations for the procurement of grain, oil, and pork. "专营," as a state economic policy, has its specific meaning and should not be arbitrarily expanded in scope.

At the national grain, cotton, and oil procurement work telephone conference held in October this year, in addition to stipulating that "cotton is to be uniformly procured and managed by the supply and marketing cooperatives, and a dual-track pricing system is not to be implemented, and the cotton free trade market is to be closed," for the management of grain and oil products, although it is stipulated that "private enterprises and individual businesses are strictly prohibited from engaging in grain and oil wholesale business," it is also clearly stated that "market trading should continue to be open, allowing for the adjustment of small amounts of grain surplus and deficit." Therefore, it is incorrect to say that "this year, major agricultural and sideline products have been changed to specialized management," which can easily lead to misunderstandings about the state's agricultural and sideline product procurement and sales policies.

As for some places making special regulations that do not allow certain agricultural and sideline products to be managed through multiple channels, causing local cadres and masses to mistakenly believe that these restricted management items are also "专营," it is not the fault of the grassroots cadres and masses. Instead, the leaders and relevant departments in those places should pay attention to listening to the opinions and voices of the masses and promptly correct any special regulations that do not conform to the state's procurement and sales policies. Specialized management is an important state policy and cannot be implemented without the approval of the State Council. Not violating the spirit of the central government and making certain temporary regulations based on local conditions is another matter.

### “专营”不能乱用

    “专营”不能乱用
    刘玉文
    12月12日的“今日谈”《莫借“专营”耍专横》，批评了某些农副产品收购部门的“官商”作风，意在维护农民的正当权益，立意很好。文章批评的那些现象在一些地区确实存在，应予重视并坚决纠正。但是，此文把这些问题概括为“专营”则是不对的，有必要加以澄清，因为“专营”有特定的含义。
    去年10月，针对化肥、农药、农膜这三种供不应求的重要农业生产资料经营中存在的多头插手倒买倒卖，市场、价格混乱的状况，国务院决定从今年1月1日起，由国家委托商业部中国农业生产资料公司和各级供销合作社的农业生产资料经营单位对化肥、农药、农膜实行专营，其他部门、单位和个人一律不准经营上述商品。对于彩电等商品，国家也曾做出专营的规定。而对粮油、生猪等农副产品的收购并没有类似规定。“专营”，作为国家的一项经济政策有其特定的含义，不应随意扩大使用范围。
    在今年10月召开的全国粮棉油收购工作电话会议上，除规定“棉花由供销社统一收购，统一经营，不搞价格双轨制，关闭棉花自由交易市场”外，对于粮、油产品的经营，虽然规定了“严禁私营企业和个体户经营粮油批发业务”，但还明确了“集市贸易要继续开放，允许进行少量粮食的余缺调剂”。因此，说“今年，主要农副产品改为专营”是不对的，容易引起人们对国家农副产品购销政策的误解。
    至于一些地方做出特殊规定，不允许某些农副产品多渠道经营，使当地的干部和群众误认为这些限制经营的项目也是“专营”，那是不能怪基层干部和群众的。倒是那里的领导者和主管部门应当注意倾听群众的意见和呼声，把不符合国家购销政策的特殊规定尽快改过来。专营是国家的重要政策，不经国务院批准，不能擅自实行。不违反中央的精神，根据当地的情况做某些临时的规定，是另一回事。
