In the ongoing fourth round of Vienna conventional arms talks in Europe, the two major military blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, today presented their respective draft agreements for the negotiations.

Both sides maintained their positions from the previous three rounds of talks in their respective draft agreements and agreed that the specific content of European conventional arms reductions should include six categories: personnel, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft, and combat helicopters.

In its draft agreement, NATO proposed that the two military blocs could retain the following maximum limits of conventional arms in the range from the Urals to the Atlantic: 20,000 main battle tanks, 28,000 armored vehicles, 16,500 artillery pieces, 5,700 combat aircraft, 1,900 combat helicopters, and 275,000 troops each for the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Europe.

The Warsaw Pact's draft agreement proposed that the maximum limits of conventional arms in Europe for both sides should be: 20,000 main battle tanks, 28,000 armored vehicles, 24,000 artillery pieces, 4,700 combat aircraft, 1,900 combat helicopters, and a total of 1.35 million troops for each military bloc in the European region. Additionally, both NATO and the Warsaw Pact maintained their previous stances on issues such as establishing stability measures and exchanging verification information in their respective draft texts.

Currently, both sides have reached agreement on the limits for tanks, armored vehicles, and combat helicopters. If based on the consensus reached in the third round of talks on the definition of artillery, the positions of both sides on the limit of artillery are also relatively close. However, there are still significant differences between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on the types and structures of aircraft, including combat helicopters, and personnel issues. On the aircraft issue, NATO does not agree with the Soviet Union's insistence that air defense interceptors should not be included in the limit of combat aircraft. On the personnel issue, the Warsaw Pact opposes NATO's proposal to set limits only for U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe, insisting on setting limits for the troops of both military blocs in Europe.

Military observers here estimate that the two military blocs are likely to reach some agreement on reducing three types of land forces—tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery—at some point next year. The fourth round of Vienna conventional arms talks in Europe began on November 9 in Vienna and will conclude on December 21.

### 在维也纳欧洲常规军备谈判中  北约华约分别提出协议草案

    在维也纳欧洲常规军备谈判中
    北约华约分别提出协议草案
    新华社维也纳12月14日电  （记者刘钢）北约和华约两大军事集团今天在正在进行的第4轮维也纳欧洲常规军备谈判中分别提出了各自的欧洲常规裁军谈判协议草案。
    双方在各自提出的协议草案中都坚持了它们在前三轮谈判中所提出的立场。并一致认为，欧洲常规裁军的具体内容应包括人员、坦克、装甲车、大炮、作战飞机和作战直升机共6大类。
    北约在其提出的协议草案中提出，两大军事集团在从乌拉尔到大西洋的范围内可以保留的常规军备的最高限额是：主战坦克2万辆，装甲车2.8万辆，大炮16500门，作战飞机5700架，作战直升机1900架，美国及苏联在欧驻军分别为275000人。
    华约的协议草案提出，双方在欧洲的常规军备的最高限额分别为，主战坦克2万辆，装甲车2.8万辆，大炮2.4万门，作战飞机4700架，作战直升机1900架，两大军事集团在欧洲地区的总兵力分别为135万。此外，北约和华约在各自的草案文本中，在建立稳定措施、核查情报交流等问题上仍坚持以往的立场。
    目前双方已在坦克、装甲车和作战直升机的限额问题上取得了一致。如果根据双方在第三轮谈判中就大炮的定义所达成的一致意见，双方在大炮限额问题上的立场也较接近。但是，北约与华约在飞机、包括作战直升机的种类结构，以及人员问题上的分歧仍然很大。在飞机问题上，北约不同意苏联所坚持的作战飞机限额中不包括国土防空截击机的立场。在人员问题上，华约则反对北约提出的只对美、苏驻欧部队规定限额的主张，坚持要对两大军事集团在欧洲的部队规定限额。
    此间军事观察家估计，两大军事集团很可能会在明年的某个时候首先就裁减陆军三种武器即坦克、装甲车和大炮达成某项协议。第4轮维也纳欧洲常规军备谈判是于11月9日在维也纳举行，将于12月21日结束。
