The People's Daily, Guangzhou, December 16th.

A horizontal economic cooperation negotiation meeting aimed at leveraging strengths, exchanging needs, and seeking common development was recently held in Zhanjiang, Guangdong. The event attracted representatives from the economic and trade sectors of 29 provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities across the country, totaling over 1,000 people. Nearly 100 businesspeople from Hong Kong, Macao, and foreign countries also attended. In just one week, 160 contracts were signed, amounting to over 500 million yuan, including 7,117,000 US dollars in foreign investment.

Several notable features emerged from this negotiation meeting:

1. **Technical Projects**: Technical-type small projects accounted for 43% of the total transaction value.
2. **Trade Agreements**: Purchase and sale-type transactions made up 57% of the total transaction value. This approach allowed for bartering and exchanging goods, providing a market outlet for a large number of agricultural and industrial products from the Leizhou Peninsula despite market sluggishness.
3. **Outward-Oriented Projects**: Outward-oriented projects accounted for 52.26% of the total transaction value of technical and purchase and sale-type projects.

    湛江扩展横向经济联合
    一次洽谈会成交5亿元
    本报讯　旨在扬长避短、互通有无、共谋发展的广东湛江市横向经济联合洽谈会，近日吸引了全国29个省（区）、市，派来经济贸易界代表1000多人，近100名港澳地区和外国客商也闻风而至，在短短的一周时间达成160项合同，总金额为5亿多元，其中外资7117万美元。
    这次洽谈会上反映出如下特点：一是技术型小项目的成交占成交总额的43％。二是购销型成交占总成交额的57％。资金短缺可以物易物、以货易货，使雷州半岛大量农副产品和工业产品在市场疲软情况下有了销路。三是外向型项目的成交，占技术型、购销型成交总额的52.26％。　（陈发）
