Title: "Tolerance" and "Desire"

While focusing on strengthening the Party's construction and cadre building, and combating negative and corrupt tendencies, I was reminded of an ancient saying: "With tolerance comes greatness, without desire comes strength." It reveals the truth and offers inspiration. In one's conduct and work, the concepts of "tolerance" and "desire" are inevitably involved. For a Communist Party member, especially a leading cadre, the relationship with "tolerance" and "desire" is even more intimate.

"Tolerance" refers to the capacity to accept and accommodate. Only with a certain amount of space and a broad capacity can one accept things. With tolerance, one can achieve greatness. If one is narrow-minded, petty, and rejects everything, lacking capacity, one can only be small and never great.

"Desire" refers to personal aspirations and the desire for satisfaction. If personal desires are insatiable, one will be impure and weak. Controlling personal desires often results in uprightness, integrity, and strength, making one capable of fighting against negative tendencies. Therefore, without desire comes strength.

A cadre who is humble and open-minded, who can listen to various opinions, consider them carefully, and gather wisdom from many, can make relatively correct decisions. Such a person can also have a broad mind, welcoming people from all directions, using cadres based on their merits and abilities, and not favoring insiders over outsiders or forming cliques. This way, in making decisions and using cadres, one can avoid or minimize errors, laying a good foundation for correctly implementing the Party's guidelines and policies and doing good work.

Of course, "tolerance" is not about being without principles, not distinguishing between correct and incorrect thoughts, or between good and bad cadres.

A cadre should have some restraint over personal desires, first considering what contributions one can make to society and the people, and then discussing what rewards society and the people can give. Of course, discussing rewards must also consider the level of social productivity, and more importantly, be subject to laws, regulations, and social ethics. As Communist Party members, our motto is to serve the people wholeheartedly. We should not seek rewards for everything but should emphasize contribution. Selfless dedication and "without desire comes strength" are consistent.

We are not advocating asceticism. A person cannot be without needs. Being selfless is a high ideal. "If it benefits the country, one should risk one's life; why should one avoid disasters and seek fortune?" Achieving public before private is also good. If one harms the public for private gain, it is not in the spirit of a Communist Party member.

Tolerance and desire are closely related. Party members with a high level of ideological awareness and consciousness often have broad minds and can control personal desires. Those who can tolerate others and listen to different opinions are usually indifferent to personal desires. Those who are greedy and insatiable often cannot tolerate different opinions, cannot tolerate others, and like to form personal dependencies and small circles.

Within the Party, there are indeed some leading cadres who, when making decisions and using cadres, have minds as small as a needle's eye, tolerating nothing. Towards money and material possessions, sensual pleasures, and pets, however, they have an insatiable desire. Some, even at an advanced age and with a comfortable life, still think about how to build a personal "Garden of Eden" for their wives, sons, and grandchildren. They are small in tolerance but great in desire.

Some leading cadres, after many years of Party life, still fall short in the matter of "tolerance" and "desire" compared to some figures from the feudal era. Everyone knows that during the Tang Dynasty, Li Shimin once said to his ministers: "If one indulges in private interests and greed, not only does one damage public laws and harm the people, but even if the matter is not exposed, one's heart will always be anxious. With so much fear, one may even die from it. How can a great man risk his life for wealth, harming his own life and reputation, and making his descendants live in shame?" (from "Tang Zhen Guan Zheng Yao"). What Li Shimin said over a thousand years ago still makes sense today.

As a Party leader, one must establish a worldview based on dialectical and historical materialism, with a high level of ideological awareness. If one pursues personal gain, harms others for personal benefit, and seeks personal interests as the ultimate goal in life, one will eventually be despised by the people. Each of us should, as Fan Zhongyan said, "Worry before the world worries, and be happy after the world is happy," correctly handling the relationship between "tolerance" and "desire." Those who are older should maintain their integrity and strive to "dance even when the flowers fall, and be fragrant even after being swept away."

### “容”与“欲”

   “容”与“欲”
    许士杰
    在聚精会神地抓党的建设，加强班子建设，克服消极腐败现象的工作中，我想起了一句古语：“有容乃大，无欲则刚。”它道出了真谛，给人以启发。一个人立身处世，办事工作，都会涉及到“容”与“欲”二个字。一个共产党员，尤其是领导干部，和“容”与“欲”的关系更为密切。
    “容”，指的是容受，容量。有一定的空间，广大的容量，才能接纳一定的东西。有容，才能成其大。狭隘得很，斤斤计较，排斥一切，没有容量，只能是小，而不可能是大。
    “欲”，指的是欲念，企求满足的欲望。如果私欲难填，就会不干净，软绵绵。能控制私欲，往往是一身正气，两袖清风，坚强可嘉，坚硬可喜，敢于与不良倾向作斗争，所以无欲则刚。
    一个干部，如果虚怀若谷，对各种不同意见，听得进去，兼听则明，集思广益，就能够出比较正确的主意，以其昭昭，使人昭昭。又能够心胸宽广，五湖四海，对不论来自何方的干部，都能按德才标准使用，广为容纳，不搞亲疏内外，拉帮结派，正确执行干部政策，团结广大干部，调动大家的积极性。这样，在出主意、用干部的大问题上，就可以不犯或少犯错误，为正确贯彻执行党的方针、政策，做好工作，奠定好的基础。
    当然，“容”不是无原则，不分思想的正确与错误，不区别干部的好与坏。
    一个干部，对自己的欲念要有个限制，先考虑自己对社会、对人民有些什么贡献，然后才能谈到人民与社会给你什么报酬。当然，谈报酬也须视社会的生产力水平如何，更要受法律法规与社会公德的规范。作为一个共产党员，我们的宗旨是全心全意为人民服务，不能事事讲报酬，而应该讲奉献。无私奉献与“无欲则刚”有一致的地方。
    我们不是提倡禁欲主义，一个人不能没有需求，大公无私当然是高境界，“苟利国家生死以，岂因祸福避趋之。”做到先公后私也很好。若是因私害公，损公利私，就没有共产党员的味道了。
    容与欲息息相关，有相当高的思想境界，有一定觉悟的共产党员，往往是胸怀宽广，对私欲能克制。凡是能容人与听进不同意见的，常是对私欲清淡得很。贪得无厌，欲壑似海的，往往听不得不同意见，容不得人，爱搞人身依附，拉小圈子。
    党内确有一些领导干部，在出主意，用干部时，胸怀像针眼一样小，什么也容不得。对金钱财物，声色犬马，却欲海难填。有的已一把年纪了，生活也满不错，却在想如何为妻子、儿子、孙子经营个人心目中的“伊甸园”。他们容小而欲大。
    有的领导干部，经过多年的党内生活，在“容”与“欲”的问题上，还比不上封建时代的一些人物。大家都知道唐朝的李世民，他曾对其公卿说过这样的话：“若徇私贪浊，非止坏公法，损百姓，纵事未发闻，中心岂不常慌？恐惧既多，也有因而致死。大丈夫岂得苟全财物，以害及身命，使子孙每怀愧耻耶？”（见《唐·贞观政要》）李世民在一千多年前所说的话，现在读起来仍觉得很有道理。
    作为一个党的领导干部，必须树立辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观，思想境界应该高。如果唯利是图，损人利己，以谋求私利作为人生的最高目的，终将被人民所唾弃。我们每个同志都要如范仲淹所说的：“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”，正确处理好“容”与“欲”的关系。上了年纪的，更要保持晚节，做到“落时犹自舞，扫后更闻香”。
