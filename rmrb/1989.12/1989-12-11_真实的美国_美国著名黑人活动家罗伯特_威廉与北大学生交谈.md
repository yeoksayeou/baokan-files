Famous American black activist Robert F. Williams, during his recent visit to China, came to Beijing University's Linhu House, where he had a discussion with some students on the social system and democracy in America.

Robert F. Williams has been engaged in the struggle against racial discrimination since the 1950s and was persecuted for it. He has visited China seven times and has been received by Party and state leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and Li Xiannian.

In the Linhu House reception room, Robert F. Williams said to the students, "I am very happy to see you all. The late Premier Zhou Enlai once told me that China is my second home. I have worked for the friendship between the peoples of China and America. I am happy about the development of friendly relations between the two countries, but I am also pained by the recent conflicts between them. Before visiting China, many friends told me that it is dangerous in China and that I might be killed. I told them that I would not be shot in China, but in places like Detroit in America, I might be shot. Now, some people in America are shouting that China recently had a massacre and that 2,000 people were killed in Tiananmen Square. I do not believe these claims because there are many hypocrites and two-faced people in America. I have heard the word 'democracy' mentioned many times, but I do not know if the word 'justice' has been mentioned. Many people in America have struggled for justice and democracy for many years, but they have never truly found justice and democracy. However, some Chinese youth now envy the decadent lifestyle in the West, especially in America, which is wrong. These people should see how America became rich. The American bourgeoisie first seized land from the Indians and brought in large numbers of black slaves from Africa. The wealth of the American rich is soaked in the blood and sweat of the working people. Even today, there are hundreds of thousands of homeless people in America, with a high unemployment rate, and billions of dollars are embezzled and stolen, allowing a few people to squander it. How can such a country incite Chinese students to overthrow the government and establish a country like theirs to achieve 'democracy'? Since 1949, the People's Republic of China has achieved remarkable results because it has solved the problem of feeding tens of billions of people, which is a great achievement in itself."

Geology student Shi Zhigang said: "From books and movies, I feel that Americans have an honest and open style, and that Americans are honest and trustworthy. Therefore, when this year's turmoil began, I believed the reports of 'Voice of America.' But later, I found that many of the reports of 'Voice of America' were false. Can you explain this to us?"

Robert F. Williams said: "Voice of America" is the mouthpiece of the American government, and we all call it a liar. Since the beginning of the Chinese student movement, "Voice of America" has spread many rumors. Its mission is to incite the overthrow of the Chinese government and create problems, not to solve these problems. "Voice of America" is a rumor machine. For example, it says one moment, "Deng Xiaoping is seriously ill," and the next moment, "2,000 people were killed in Tiananmen Square." All these are exaggerated and distorted facts, which are beneficial to the anti-China policy of some people in the American government.

Shi Zhigang said: "Have you seen a few miles long film reflecting the Chinese army killing people?"

Robert F. Williams said: "I heard that there is such a film, but it has never been shown. Now, some people in America are inciting Chinese students studying in America to oppose the Chinese government. These students have believed many rumors and been deceived. I think these students do not truly understand America. They only know about things like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in America. If they live there for a long time, they will find that they have made a big mistake. There are indeed some rich people in America, but most people are gambling with their future. Chinese students should learn to distinguish good from bad. In the West, there are good things and bad things. China should absorb the good things and not bring the bad things to China."

Robert F. Williams also said: "America has a good constitution, but whether it is followed is another matter. A high court in America recently sentenced a 15-year-old girl with a mental illness to death, and even the archbishop of Rome protested against this. America claims to be a Christian country, and according to the teachings, one should be chaste when criticizing others, but some people in the American government are not like this."

Shi Zhigang said: "I have a question. Is the voting election and the freedom of speech in the American Congress not democracy?"

Robert F. Williams said: "The elected officials are all screened and are in line with the interests of the American government. Before the election, some people will use money to buy votes, and a lot of money will be spent on this. In America, many freedoms are hypocritical. As for me, the American government has made regulations and announced them nationwide to prevent me from becoming a national black leader. This shows that America does not allow everyone to have the opportunity to become a leader, and even the American Central Intelligence Agency will take measures such as assassination to persecute people."

History graduate student Zhang Shichang said: "What is the current situation of blacks in America?"

Robert F. Williams said: "Now, only a very small number of blacks have improved living conditions, and a few blacks are used, but they have no power, like puppets. The contradictions between most blacks and the government are still intensifying, and many blacks are still being persecuted. In America, military spending is high, and drug abuse and prostitution are increasing day by day. Not only blacks, but also some whites are experiencing a decline in living standards. I hope you will not stop at some books when understanding America, and do not believe those propaganda reports. You should truly understand the real American society. I am not asking you to hate America, but to understand the facts. You used to have a magical way of thinking, as if without your own efforts, just shouting a few words of democracy would solve everything. You should study hard and contribute to China's modernization."

    真实的美国
    ——美国著名黑人活动家罗伯特·威廉与北大学生交谈
    张宝瑞　李京华
    美国著名黑人活动家罗伯特·威廉在近日访华期间，来到北京大学临湖轩，与部分学生就美国的社会制度及民主等问题进行了交谈。
    罗伯特·威廉从50年代开始就从事反对种族歧视的斗争，曾因此遭到迫害。以后7次访问中国，受到毛泽东、周恩来、邓小平、李先念等党和国家领导人的接见。
    在临湖轩会客厅里，罗伯特·威廉对学生们说，我访问见到你们，心情非常愉快。已故的中国总理周恩来曾经对我说，中国是我的第二故乡。我曾为中美两国人民的友谊工作过。我为两国人民友好关系的发展而高兴，也为最近中美两国关系发生的一些冲突而痛苦。在访问中国之前，许多朋友对我说，在中国很危险，你要被杀害。我告诉他们，我到中国不会被枪杀，如果在美国的底特律等地，反而有被枪杀的危险。现在美国有人叫嚷，中国最近大屠杀，在天安门广场杀害2000多人。我不相信这类说法，因为在美国有许多两面派和伪君子。我发现“民主”这个词提了许多次，但不知是否提到了“正义”二字。在美国有许多人为正义和民主斗争了多年，但是从没有真正找到正义和民主。可是现在一些中国青年却羡慕西方，特别是羡慕美国的腐朽生活，这是错误的。这些人应该看到美国是如何致富的，美国的资产阶级首先从印第安人手中掠夺土地，从非洲运来大批黑奴。美国有钱人的财富渗透了劳动人民的血汗。至今在美国有成千上万的人无家可归，失业率极高，数以十亿计的钱款被贪污、盗窃，任少数人挥霍。这样的国家煽动中国学生起来推翻政府，建立他们那样的国家能够实现什么“民主”呢？中华人民共和国自从1949年建国以来，成绩显著，因为它解决了十几亿人的吃饭问题，仅这一点就是了不起的事情。
    地质系学生史志刚说：从书本上和电影中我感到美国人具有诚实、开朗的风格，美国人是诚实可信的，所以今年这场动乱开始时，我非常相信“美国之音”的报道。可是后来我发现“美国之音”的报道有许多是虚假的，您能不能给我们解释一下？
    罗伯特·威廉说：“美国之音”是美国政府的喉舌，我们都叫它骗子。从中国学潮一开始，“美国之音”就造了不少谣言，它的使命是煽动推翻中国政府，制造问题，而不是如何解决这些问题。“美国之音”是一个造谣机器，如一会儿说：“邓小平病重”，一会儿又说：“天安门广场死了2000多人”，所有这些都夸大歪曲了事实，以利于美国政府中某些人的反华政策。
    史志刚说：您是否看到过几英里长反映中国军队杀人的胶片？
    罗伯特·威廉说：听人说有这样的胶片，但是从来没有放映过。现在美国的一些人煽动中国留美学生反对中国政府，这些学生听信了许多谣言，上当受骗。我认为这些学生没有真正了解美国，他们仅了解到类似美国的米老鼠、唐老鸭之类的情况。如果长久生活下去，他们就会发现自己犯了一个绝大的错误。在美国确有一些人富裕，但是大多数人在拿未来做赌博。中国学生应当学会区别好的和坏的东西。在西方，有好的东西，也有坏的东西，中国应当吸取好的东西，不要把不好的东西也带到中国来。
    罗伯特·威廉又说：美国有一部很好的宪法，但是有没有按照宪法做是一个问题。美国的一家高级法院最近曾把一个患有神经病的15岁女孩子判处死刑，连罗马的大主教也对此提出抗议。美国自称是一个基督教国家，按照教义，批评别人时，自己应贞洁，可是美国政府的一些人却不是这样的。
    史志刚说：我请教一个问题，美国的投票选举、美国议会发言自由，这不是民主吗？
    罗伯特·威廉说：被选举人都是经过筛选的，符合美国政府利益的人。选举之前，一些人要用钱收买选民，在这方面要花很多钱。在美国，许多自由都是虚伪的。就我个人而言，美国政府曾做过规定，并向全国通报，阻止我成为全国黑人领袖。由此可见，美国并不是让每个人都有机会成为领袖人物，甚至美国中央情报局还要采取暗杀等方式进行迫害活动。
    历史系研究生张世昌说：现在黑人在美国的境况如何？
    罗伯特·威廉说：如今只有极少一部分黑人的生活条件得到改善，少数黑人被选用，但是没有权，像木偶一样。大多数黑人与政府的矛盾仍在加剧，现在仍有许多黑人遭受迫害。在美国，军费开支大，吸毒、卖淫现象与日俱增。不仅黑人，也有一部分白人生活水平下降。我希望你们对美国的了解，不要停留在一些书本上，也不要听信那些宣传报道，要真正了解现实中的美国社会，我并不是要你们憎恨美国，而是要你们了解实情。你们过去有一种变魔术般的思想，好像不经过自己的努力，喊几句民主就什么事情都解决了。你们应该扎扎实实地学习，争取为中国的现代化建设贡献力量。
