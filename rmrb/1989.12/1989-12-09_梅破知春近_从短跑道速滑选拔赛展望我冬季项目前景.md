In just over two months, the second Asian Winter Games will open in Sapporo, Japan.

Currently, China's ice and snow sports team, consisting of 137 athletes, is divided into six groups for intensive training. They are full of confidence and determined to surpass the achievements of the first Asian Winter Games. In the first Asian Winter Games, there were 39 gold medals, with the Japanese team winning 29, while China's athletes won only 4.

A few days ago, 60 male and female short track speed skating athletes from various regions gathered at the Capital Gymnasium in Beijing for a three-day competition to select 12 athletes for China's short track speed skating team.

This selection competition broke away from the past practice of pre-selecting team members. All 60 athletes competed on an equal footing, and those with the best performance would be selected. Therefore, this seemingly ordinary competition attracted some provincial and municipal sports bureau directors to come and cheer.

The first day's pursuit race saw intense competition, with old hands like Li Yan and Wang Xiu Lan maintaining their advantage, while newcomers like Wang Qing and Wu Yan were hot on their heels. The experienced Jilin athlete Zhang Yanmei fell twice during the competition, and her teammates said, "She was too nervous." On the second day, the women's 500-meter race saw Qiqihar's Wang Xiu Lan and Harbin's Zheng Chunyang break the national record four times. On the third day, four male athletes also broke the national record for the 1000-meter race. The athletes' performances on the field were praised by experts off the field. This year, the athletes' physical fitness and specialized skills have generally improved, and they have become more proficient in using competition techniques.

In recent years, China's short track speed skating athletes have won multiple world championships, demonstrating considerable strength and becoming a key project in China's ice and snow sports. In May of this year, the national short track training team was reorganized into two groups. One group is still led by the original coach Xin Qingshan, who trains eight athletes from Jilin; the other group is led by coach Ding Zilai from Mudanjiang, who trains eight athletes from Heilongjiang. Wang Yingfu from the State Sports Commission said that this is an introduction of the competition mechanism into training.

The second Asian Winter Games will not include figure skating and ice dancing competitions, making China's hopes for a championship mainly fall on short track speed skating. In the first Asian Winter Games, none of China's eight male and female short track athletes made it into the top three. Now, our athletes have the ability to compete with Japanese and South Korean athletes and have the confidence to surpass them.

Apart from short track and a few long track speed skating events, most of China's ice and snow sports are still in a relatively backward state. People look forward to the ice and snow athletes working together to explore scientific and reasonable training methods, and to break out of Asia and march towards the world as soon as possible.

    梅破知春近
    ——从短跑道速滑选拔赛展望我冬季项目前景
    本报记者　李北大
    再过两个多月，第二届亚洲冬季运动会将在日本札幌揭幕。
    眼下，由137名健儿组成的我国冰雪项目集训队分六路秣马厉兵，他们满怀信心，决意要超过在上届冬季亚运会上所取得的成绩。首届冬季亚运会，共有39枚金牌，日本队拿走29枚，我国选手仅获4枚。
    前几天在北京首都体育馆，各地60名男女短跑道速滑选手汇集这里，同场较量3天，以选拔出我国短跑道速滑队的12名选手。
    这次选拔赛一改过去内定队员的作法，60名选手谁有本事谁入选。因此，这个本来不起眼的比赛竟招来一些省、市体委主任前来助战。
    第一天追逐赛就出现了你追我赶、各不示弱的激烈场面。老将李琰、王秀兰等仍保持优势，王青、吴艳等新手紧紧追赶上来。久经沙场的吉林名将张艳梅比赛中两次摔倒，同伴说，“她太紧张了”。第二天女子500米比赛，齐齐哈尔的王秀兰和哈尔滨的郑春阳4次打破全国纪录。第三天男选手不甘寂寞，也有4人打破1000米全国纪录。场上队员的表现得到场外行家们的肯定，这一年，选手们身体素质和专项能力普遍有提高，比赛技巧运用熟练了。
    我国短跑道速滑选手近年多次摘取世界大赛桂冠，颇具实力，当之无愧地成为我国冰雪运动的重点项目。今年5月，国家短跑道集训队重新组建，分成两个组训练。一组仍由原教练辛庆山负责，他指导8名吉林籍选手；另一组由牡丹江的丁自来指导8名黑龙江选手。国家体委王应辅称，这是把竞争机制引进训练中。
    第二届冬季亚运会不设花样滑冰和冰上舞蹈比赛，这使中国队夺魁希望主要落在短跑道上。上届冬亚会，我国8名男女短跑道选手无一人进入前三名。而今，我们的健儿已有能力与日本、南朝鲜选手抗衡，并且有信心超过对手。
    除短跑道和个别大跑道速滑项目外，我国多数冰雪项目尚处于比较落后的状态。人们期待冰雪健儿齐心协力，摸索出科学合理的训练方法，早日全面冲出亚洲，迈向世界。
