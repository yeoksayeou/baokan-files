	South Africa Violates UN Security Council Resolution by Expanding Military Facilities in Walvis Bay

	Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, December 14th - According to reports from Namibian newspapers today, South Africa is currently increasing and renovating military facilities in central-western Namibia's Walvis Bay, in an attempt to achieve permanent occupation.

	The report states that the South African authorities are rebuilding their naval base in Walvis Bay and have also designated a large area of land to construct a permanent camp for the 61st Mechanized Brigade, which was recently relocated from northern Namibia.

	The report says that this not only poses a significant threat to the security of Namibia, which is soon to gain independence, but also seriously violates the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 432 regarding the issue of Walvis Bay.

	The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 432 stipulates that Walvis Bay should be returned to Namibia as soon as possible and that South Africa should not engage in any activities that harm Namibia's independence from Walvis Bay.

	Walvis Bay is Namibia's only deep-water port, covering an area of 1,124 square kilometers and located 600 kilometers from South Africa's northeastern border. According to official figures, South Africa currently has 1,600 troops stationed there.

	Prime Minister Refuses to Accept National Division

	Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 14th - Lebanese Prime Minister Hus said that the government's current priority is to consolidate its legitimacy and oppose attempts to divide the country.

	According to a report from Qatar News Agency today, Hus denied the existence of any plans to reach a solution or a deal with Christian leader Oun. He pointed out that this could weaken the issue of the legitimacy of the Lebanese government, which is as important as the issue of Lebanese unity.

	Oun, who is supported by 20,000 Christian troops, refuses to recognize Hus's government and continues to occupy the presidential palace in East Beirut.

	Hus denied any intention to include Oun and representatives of the Christian militia in the cabinet. He said that the government should take unified action to deal with the current state of division in Lebanon. Hus was appointed as Prime Minister and tasked with forming a cabinet by President Hrawi last month.

    南非违反安理会决议
    在纳海湾扩建军事设施
    新华社温得和克12月14日电　据纳米比亚报纸今天报道，南非目前正在纳米比亚中西部沃尔维斯海湾增加和改建军事设施，妄图实现永久占领。
    报道说，南非当局正在重建它在沃尔维斯海湾的海军基地，而且还辟出一大片土地，准备为最近从纳米比亚北部转移到这里的第61机械化营修建永久性营地。
    报道说，这不但给即将独立的纳米比亚的安全造成巨大威胁，而且严重违反了联合国安理会关于沃尔维斯海湾问题的432号决议。
    联合国安理会通过的432号决议规定，早日实现沃尔维斯海湾回归纳米比亚；南非不得利用沃尔维斯海湾从事任何损害纳米比亚独立的活动。
    沃尔维斯海湾是纳米比亚唯一深水港，面积1124平方公里，距南非东北边境600公里。据官方数字，南非目前在该地驻军1600人。黎总理反对国家分裂
    新华社贝鲁特12月14日电　黎巴嫩总理胡斯说，政府目前最关注的，是巩固其合法性，反对旨在分裂国家的企图。
    据卡塔尔通讯社今天报道，胡斯否认存在任何同基督教派领导人奥恩达成解决办法和交易的计划。他指出，这可能削弱黎巴嫩政府的合法性问题，这个问题和黎巴嫩统一的问题同样重要。
    有2万基督教军队支持的奥恩拒绝承认胡斯为总理的政府，继续占领贝鲁特东区的总统府。
    胡斯否认有吸收奥恩和基督教民兵代表入阁的打算。他说，应该通过政府采取统一行动来对付目前威胁黎巴嫩的分裂状态。胡斯是上月由总统赫拉维任命为总理并组阁的。
