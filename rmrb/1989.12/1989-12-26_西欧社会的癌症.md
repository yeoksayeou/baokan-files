The drug problem in Western Europe is becoming increasingly severe, with smuggling and trafficking rampant. Drug issues are plaguing Western European countries like an epidemic. In late November, Interpol held a meeting in France, making the fight against drug smuggling its top priority.

Following marijuana and heroin, cocaine has swept through the Western European market. A few years ago, a cocaine substitute known as "crack" or "kill pills" emerged in the United States and has now appeared in France and other parts of Western Europe. Some predict that Western Europe, like the United States, will become a major market for drugs.

The international nature of drug trafficking and the "corporate" style of operations are new characteristics of drug infiltration in Western Europe. Smugglers no longer use outdated methods like hiding drugs in suitcase linings or storing them in the human body. Instead, they cleverly disguise drugs, packing them into shipping containers and transporting them through multiple countries by sea and land to evade police, then smuggling them in large quantities. For example, in early this year, Spain's largest drug bust at Madrid Airport found drugs hidden in tens of thousands of fresh coconuts in a shipping container.

According to experts, the amount of drugs seized by various countries varies, roughly between 5% to 20% of the total smuggled amount. This means that a large portion of drugs have already illegally entered the market, meeting the demand in Western Europe. However, Western European countries find it difficult to curb drug consumption. In recent years, the number of drug users in Western Europe has been increasing, and the affected social strata are becoming more widespread. Statistics show that in 1969, the French police questioned only 210 drug users. Currently, there are 900,000 drug users in France, 72% of whom are under 25 years old. In an Italian city with a population of 250,000, there are 8,000 drug users. Notably, while drug users were previously mostly from the lower strata of society, today's addicts include the unemployed, young students, scholars, engineers, and stockbrokers.

The dramatic increase in drug demand, in turn, stimulates drug traffickers. Despite international condemnation and police crackdowns, drug traffickers remain undeterred, as it is a highly profitable business.

Drug abuse is closely linked to current social issues in Western Europe, such as mass unemployment, family breakdowns, and declining moral standards. The spread of drug problems further exacerbates these already serious social issues, creating a vicious cycle.

In recent years, Western European governments have frequently held international conferences or bilateral meetings to discuss and coordinate policies on drug control. The International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) based in Lyon has become an important international organization for exchanging information and jointly tracking down drug lords between Western Europe and the rest of the world.

Within Western Europe, the member states of the European Community established a joint committee named after President Pompidou as early as 1971 and drafted an anti-drug convention. In 1986, the five-country anti-drug club consisting of Austria, West Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France recently resumed activities.

Western European countries have also established or strengthened anti-drug command structures to coordinate actions among relevant departments. Since last year, the French government has increased funding, updated equipment, and trained personnel to build an anti-drug force. It has also set up liaison offices in Belgium, Thailand, Colombia, and other places to keep abreast of developments.

People believe that while Western Europe's anti-drug efforts have seen some results, they have been ineffective in preventing and cracking down on drug users. This is obviously because today's society is unable to eradicate the social roots of drug abuse and is powerless to fundamentally stop the infiltration of international drug traffickers.

    西欧社会的癌症
    本报记者　张启华
    当前，西欧地区的吸毒现象日趋严重，走私贩毒十分猖獗。毒品问题简直像瘟疫一样困扰着西欧各国。11月下旬，国际刑警组织在法国召开会议，把打击毒品走私作为它的首要任务。
    继大麻、海洛因之后，古柯碱已席卷西欧市场。几年前在美国上市的可卡因代用品，人称作“杀人丸”的“闷打”，也在法国和西欧一些地区出现。有人预言，西欧同美国一样将成为毒品大市场。
    国际性的贩毒、“企业化”的经营是毒品侵袭西欧的新特点。走私者已不再采用藏于皮箱夹层、存入人体的陈旧办法，而是把毒品巧加伪装，打入货运集装箱，经海陆辗转多国，避开警方，然后大批量的走私入境。例如，西班牙今年初在马德里机场破获的一桩最大的走私案件，毒品竟藏在集装箱里的几万颗鲜椰子里。
    据专家们估计，各国查获毒品的数量不同，大概占走私量的5％到20％不等，也就是说，大部分毒品已非法流入，满足了西欧市场的需求。然而，西欧国家很难遏制毒品消费。近几年来，西欧吸毒的人数有增无减，受毒害的阶层也更广泛。据统计，在1969年，法国警方传讯的吸毒者仅210人。目前法国吸过毒的人已达90万人，其中72％是25岁以下的青少年。意大利一个25万人口的小城，竟有8000人吸毒。特别值得注意的是，过去吸毒者大多数属于社会底层的人，如今瘾君子既有失业者、青年学生，也有学者、工程师、证券经纪人等。
    毒品需求的剧增反过来又刺激了那些毒品贩子。尽管国际社会严厉谴责，警方四处查禁，但毒贩们毫不示弱，因这是一本万利的生意。
    吸毒同当前西欧社会的大批失业、家庭分离、道德水平下降等现象有着密切的联系。而吸毒问题的泛滥又把本来就很严重的社会问题推向了更加危险的地步，形成了恶性循环。
    近年来，西欧政府经常通过国际会议或双边会晤，就禁毒问题磋商、协调政策。设在里昂的国际刑警组织，成为西欧与外界互通情报、共同侦缉毒枭的重要国际组织之一。
    在西欧内部，共同体国家早在1971年就以蓬皮杜总统为名建立联合小组，并制订反毒公约。1986年，奥地利、西德、意大利、瑞士和法国成立的五国反毒俱乐部最近又恢复活动。
    西欧各国还普遍建立或加强缉毒的指挥机构，协调各国的有关部门的行动。法国政府从去年开始，从增拨开支、更新设备、培训人员等几个方面，组建反毒队伍。它还在比利时、泰国、哥伦比亚等处设立联络站，随时掌握有关动向。
    人们认为，西欧的肃毒斗争，虽略有战果，但在预防和打击吸毒者方面难有见效，这显然是因为今天人们还无法铲除吸毒的社会根源，也无力从根本上阻止国际毒贩的入侵。
