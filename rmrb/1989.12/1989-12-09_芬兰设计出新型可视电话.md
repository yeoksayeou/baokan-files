Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, December 9th.

Finland's National Technical Research Center has recently designed a new type of visual telephone service system for the elderly and disabled.

This system includes a security telephone, a television camera, and a monitor, and is connected to alarm centers, health care stations, and other service departments. Elderly individuals living alone and disabled persons can, in the event of an emergency, press a button on the telephone or a portable remote control switch to immediately contact a 24-hour alarm center. The staff at the alarm center can use the television image to understand the specific situation of the person seeking help at home, while the computer terminal immediately displays the name, address, health information, and contact numbers of the relatives of the person seeking help. The alarm center can then quickly take specific rescue measures based on these clues.

In addition, the elderly and disabled can also obtain various consultations and assistance through this service system. For example, they can receive nursing guidance from health care stations via the visual telephone, and if necessary, request a doctor to come to their home for a consultation. If a video camera is connected to this system, it can remind users to take their medication on time.

This system has taken certain confidentiality measures, and outsiders cannot obtain information about the users. Therefore, it is safe for elderly individuals living alone and the disabled.

    芬兰设计出新型可视电话
    新华社赫尔辛基电　芬兰国家技术研究中心最近为老年人和残疾人设计出一种新型可视电话服务系统。
    这种系统包括安全电话、电视摄像机和监视器，并与报警中心、卫生保健站等服务部门联网。独身老人和残疾人在发生意外情况时，只需按一下电话上的按钮或随身携带的遥控开关，就能立即同昼夜服务的报警中心取得联系。报警中心的工作人员可以通过电视图像了解到求援者在家中的具体情况，同时计算机终端设备上马上显示出求援者的姓名、地址、健康资料及亲属的电话号码。报警中心可根据这些线索迅速采取具体救援措施。
    除此之外，老人和残疾人还可以通过这一服务系统得到各种咨询和帮助。例如，他们可以通过可视电话获得来自卫生保健站的护理指导，必要时还可请医生上门就诊。如果将录相机接入这一系统，可提醒用户按时服药。
    这一系统采取了一定的保密措施，外人无法获得有关使用者的信息。
    因此，它对独身老人和残疾人是安全的。
