Panamanian University Condemns U.S. Military Aggression
Iran Holds Protest March Against U.S. Invasion of Panama

	New Xinhua News Agency Panama City 26 December - Panamanian University issued a statement on the 26th strongly condemning the United States' savage military aggression against Panama.

	The statement, signed by the university president Adames, called on universities across Latin America to jointly condemn the U.S. military's unrestrained aggression against Panama.

	The statement pointed out: "Panama's political crisis should be resolved by Panamanians themselves through negotiations under the premise of maintaining national sovereignty and social justice."

	President Adames stated in the declaration: "The U.S. military's attack on Panama has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Panamanians. Currently, the Panamanian people are living in pain and terror." The statement believes that the U.S. military's invasion of Panama tramples on the international law principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

	In recent days, the U.S. military's invasion of Panama has been severely condemned by Panamanian political, educational, and social circles.

	According to the New Xinhua News Agency Tehran 26 December - Tens of thousands of Iranians today held a protest march in the capital Tehran to protest the U.S. armed invasion of Panama.

	Including regular military personnel and members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the protesters chanted "Death to America" slogans and held a rally in front of the Parliament building.

	Some protesters also handed a letter of protest to the Swiss Embassy, which manages U.S. interests in Iran.
