The main theme of ideological work

“Currently, the Party’s ideological and political work should focus on stability and emphasize encouragement. The overall stability and development of society can create conditions for stabilizing schools, while the stability of schools plays a crucial role in maintaining and developing the stability of society. Only by strengthening and improving school ideological and political work can we unify thoughts and stabilize schools; and schools can only cultivate qualified socialist talents on the basis of stability.” This is a segment from the report given by Chen Zili, the deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, at the Shanghai Municipal Schools' Ideological and Political Work Conference.

The Party and government leaders and political work cadres of various levels and types of schools in Shanghai, especially higher education institutions, found this segment particularly resonant.

“By linking the stability of higher education institutions with the overall stability of Shanghai, the Municipal Party Committee has shown the importance of ideological and political work in higher education institutions,” said a cadre from Shanghai Jiaotong University during a discussion. This conference’s emphasis on strengthening and improving school ideological and political work, with the main theme of “focusing on stability and emphasizing encouragement,” we understand as follows: the first sentence reflects the consideration of China’s largest political issue; the second sentence is about calmly summarizing our work, looking to the future, and elevating ideological and political work to a new level.

During the spring and summer student movements, disturbances, and counter-revolutionary riots, many students were to varying degrees involved. The harsh reality made everyone seriously consider this question: why were so many students, some of whom were key nurtured students, involved in the disturbances? Why did some students believe the rumors from “Voice of America” so completely? Can we blame these young students entirely? Everyone agreed that we cannot blame them entirely. At a time when they should have received the most necessary political and ideological education, we did not provide it. We have some responsibility.

Therefore, encouragement should first be directed at strengthening ideological and political work. Encouragement cannot wait; it cannot wait for higher authorities to provide some “substance” before encouraging. We must start encouraging now.

Stability and strengthening the political work team

Strengthening and improving ideological and political work requires building a competent political work team.

However, the current political work team in colleges and universities faces issues such as insufficient numbers, unstable morale, and declining quality. A deputy secretary of the Party Committee at Tongji University said that the university has only 23 full-time political work personnel on the front line, which is too few for a university with nearly ten thousand students. Shanghai Jiaotong University has formed a student political work team known as the “108 Generals,” but according to a ratio of 120:1, it is still short by half. The current situation of the school’s political work team is related to the decline in the status of political work in recent years. Inconsistencies in policies are also an important reason. The Municipal Party Committee and government leaders have noticed this and, in addition to emphasizing the importance of strengthening ideological and political work, will also make corresponding adjustments in relevant policies to ensure that political work personnel receive equal treatment as professional and technical personnel.

Wang Hongsheng, a teacher at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics who has been engaged in political work for several decades, said that the Party and the state have high expectations for political work cadres, and political work cadres need to improve their ideological level. The spirit of “suffering first and enjoying later” still needs to be carried forward. Communist Party members and political work cadres should have a spirit of dedication and learn from Zhang Side and Norman Bethune to become noble individuals.

During the group discussions at various universities, suggestions were made on how to build a political work team. Yinyi Zuo, the head of the Propaganda Department at Shanghai Jiaotong University, suggested that specific measures should be taken to ensure that young teachers who recently graduated can settle down and love this work; political work cadres who graduated in the 1970s and 1950s and 1960s should be trained and improved, giving them some “grazing” time, so that they can squeeze out more and better “milk” to nourish young students. He also proposed a plan to “select, train, and improve” political work cadres. Strengthening patriotic education for students

Everyone agreed during the discussion that solving deep-seated ideological problems is a long-term task of ideological and political education and cannot be rushed or achieved overnight. Currently, it is necessary to strengthen patriotic education in connection with reality, especially to conduct national conditions education.

According to the information introduced at the conference, many universities have already done this and achieved initial results.

The East China University of Chemical Technology has opened courses on national conditions education for first and second-year students and lectures related to national conditions education for third and fourth-year students.

Fudan University organized patriotic education activities centered around patriotism before and after National Day. They emphasized that patriotic education should focus on six key points. These six key points are: first, fully understanding that without the Communist Party there would be no New China, and only socialism can save China and develop China; second, adhering to concrete patriotism, loving the People’s Republic of China led by the Communist Party and adhering to the socialist path; third, fully understanding China’s national conditions and recognizing that China is a socialist country; fourth, fully recognizing the intentions of international hostile forces to hope for the “peaceful evolution” of socialist countries and enhancing political vigilance; fifth, criticizing colonial and subservient thoughts and increasing national pride and national spirit; sixth, learning China’s excellent historical and cultural traditions and eliminating the influence of national nihilistic thoughts.

    着眼于稳定　着力于鼓劲
    ——上海市学校思想政治工作会议侧记
    本报记者　萧关根
    思想工作的主旋律
    “当前全党的思想政治工作要着眼于稳定，着力于鼓劲。整个社会的稳定发展可以为稳定学校创造条件，而学校的稳定又对保持社会的稳定和发展起着十分重要的作用。只有加强和改进学校思想政治工作，才能统一思想，稳定学校；而学校也只有在稳定的基础上，才能精心培养社会主义合格人才。”这是在上海市学校思想政治工作会议上，市委副书记陈至立作的报告中的一段话。
    上海各级各类学校、特别是高等学校的党政领导和政工干部，对这段话感到特别深切。
    “市委把高校的稳定与上海全局的稳定紧紧联系在一起，可见高校思想政治工作的重要。”上海交通大学的干部在讨论中说，这次会议提出加强和改进学校思想政治工作的主旋律——“着眼于稳定，着力于鼓劲”，我们理解：前一句话出自对中国最大的政治的考虑；后一句话，是让我们冷静地总结工作，面向未来，使思想政治工作登上新台阶。
    在今年春夏之交的学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱中，不少学生程度不同地卷入。严酷的事实使大家认真思考这样一个问题：为什么有那么多的学生，有的还是重点培养的学生卷入到动乱中去？有些学生那么相信“美国之音”的谣言，能完全怪这些青年学生吗？大家认为，不能全怪他们。在他们应该接受最需要的政治思想教育的时候，我们没有给他们。我们是有一定的责任的。
    所以，鼓劲首先要鼓在加强思想政治工作上。鼓劲不能再等，不能等上面拿出什么“干货”来再鼓，要从现在就鼓劲。
        稳定和加强政工队伍
    加强和改进思想政治工作，必须建设一支精干的思想政治工作队伍。
    但是，目前高校的政工队伍存在着人数不足、人心不稳、素质下降的问题。同济大学的一位党委副书记说，全校在第一线的专职政工人员只有23人，这对有近万名学生的大学来说是太少了。上海交大已形成一支号称“108将”的学生政工队伍，但按120∶1的比例，还差半数。学校政工队伍的这种状况，与近几年来政治工作地位下降有关系。政策上的不配套，也是一个重要原因。市委、市府领导已注意到，除了要强调加强思想政治工作的重要性外，还要在有关政策上作相应调整，使政工人员享受相应专业技术人员的同等待遇。
    干了几十年政工工作的上海财经大学教师王鸿生说，党和国家对政工干部寄予厚望，政工干部更需要提高思想境界。“吃苦在前、享乐在后”的精神还需要发扬。共产党员、政工干部要有献身精神，要向张思德、白求恩学习，成为一个高尚的人。
    各个高校在分组讨论中对如何建设一支政工队伍献计献策。上海交大党委宣传部长尹继佐认为，应拿出具体办法，使近期毕业的青年教师安心、热爱这项工作；毕业于70年代和50、60年代的老政工干部要培训提高，给他们一点“吃草”的时间，这样，他们才能挤出更多更好的“奶汁”，哺育青年学生。他还提出了一个对政工干部实施“选拔、培训、提高”的设想。加强对学生的爱国主义教育
    大家在讨论中认为，深层思想问题的解决是长期的思想政治教育的任务，不能急于求成，不能一蹴而就。当前，应当联系实际加强爱国主义教育，尤其是要进行国情教育。
    据会议上介绍的情况，不少大学已在这样做，并取得了初步效果。
    华东化工学院已在一二年级开设国情教育课，三四年级开有关国情教育的讲座。
    复旦大学在国庆前后开展了以爱国主义为中心内容的教育活动。他们强调爱国主义教育要突出6个重点。这六个重点为：一是充分认识没有共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义才能够救中国、才能发展中国的道理；二是坚持具体的爱国主义，爱国就是要爱共产党领导的坚持社会主义道路的中华人民共和国；三是充分认识我国国情，认识我国是个社会主义国家；四是充分认清国际敌对势力寄希望于社会主义国家“和平演变”的企图，提高政治警惕性；五是批判殖民地奴化思想和附庸思想，增强民族自尊心和民族气节；六是学习我国优秀历史文化传统，清除民族虚无主义思潮影响。
