People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and Fujian Daily reporters report: General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin recently emphasized during his inspection and research in Fujian Province that it is necessary to adhere to reform and expand opening up, and to accelerate and improve the reform and opening up in coastal areas.

Jiang Zemin arrived in Fujian on December 22. From December 22 to 25, accompanied by Provincial Party Secretary Chen Guangyi and Governor Wang Zhaoguo, he inspected the old revolutionary base area of Minxi, Zhangzhou City, Xiamen Special Economic Zone, and Fuzhou City.

Minxi Old Revolutionary Base was an important part of the Central Soviet Area. When Jiang Zemin arrived in Longyan, Minxi Old Revolutionary Base, it was the 60th anniversary of the famous Gutian Conference. He got off the plane at 11:30 AM, without resting, he rushed by car for more than 200 kilometers to Shanghang County, Gutian Town, to visit the Gutian Conference site. The words "Gutian Conference Shines Forever" stood out prominently among the trees. General Secretary walked into the Gutian Conference site, and more than ten old Red Army soldiers, old guerrillas, old Red Guards, old contact houses, old cadres, and representatives warmly welcomed him. General Secretary shook hands with them and expressed his greetings. He held the hand of Lei Dechai, an old Red Guard over 80 years old, and said emotionally, "I am here on behalf of the Party Central Committee to visit you and learn from you!" Then, General Secretary visited the Gutian Conference Memorial Hall and observed various precious revolutionary relics. In front of the exhibition hall with the decision of the Gutian Conference drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong, Jiang Zemin carefully read each item. He said: These contents are still applicable today. We must follow the spirit of the Gutian Conference in building the party, building the army, and conducting ideological and political work. Before leaving, General Secretary wrote the inscription "Inherit and carry forward the spirit of the Gutian Conference, strengthen the construction of the party and the army." During the inspection and research, he repeatedly emphasized the need to learn from the past and know the present, carry forward revolutionary traditions, and strengthen ideological construction. Jiang Zemin said that Chairman Mao and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries paid great attention to investigation and research, closely linked with the masses, and summed up the experience of ideological construction in the early days of party and army building under such difficult conditions. This decision still shines with brilliant ideological light today and needs to be well studied and implemented. Since the implementation of reform and opening up, we have emphasized that while learning advanced science and technology and management experience from the West, we must consciously resist bourgeois decadent ideology. It seems that just emphasizing resistance is not enough, and we cannot just defend; we must definitely occupy the position with Marxism. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, for the ideological position, if the proletarian ideology does not occupy it, the bourgeois ideology will definitely occupy it. We must propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the broad cadres and masses, carry out active ideological struggle within the party, and correct various erroneous thoughts.

In the early 1980s, Jiang Zemin participated in the planning and personally directed the construction of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. After many years, he was delighted to see the tremendous changes in Xiamen. In the Luli Industrial Zone, where the Xiamen Special Economic Zone started, General Secretary visited several Sino-foreign joint ventures, including Lumei Storage Disk Co., Ltd., Sandehua Industrial Co., Ltd., and Xiamen Electronics Co., Ltd., and inquired in detail about their production, operation, and sales situations. He then had a discussion with the general managers of nine "three resources" enterprises. He chatted with these entrepreneurs from the United States, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong and Macao regions. After listening carefully to the development situation of these enterprises, he emphasized: China's reform and opening-up policy will not change because of the political turmoil this year, because our chief architect of opening up to the outside world is Comrade Deng Xiaoping. From the day of implementing opening up, it has been clearly stipulated that it must develop along the socialist direction. We adhere to the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, which not only does not harm the interests of foreign investors but also ensures that investment business can be better conducted, making reform and opening up faster and better.

Several entrepreneurs nodded in agreement as they listened to General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech. Jiang Zemin then told them: China's special economic zones have a broad prospect and great development potential. We welcome more foreign investors, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao to invest and set up factories. I think that to make Sino-foreign cooperation better, first, we must understand each other, second, we must trust each other, third, we must benefit each other, and fourth, we must have a long-term consideration. As long as both investment parties follow these four principles, whether joint ventures or wholly-owned enterprises, they will definitely be successful. Believe that China's reform and opening up will be better and better, and wish you truly achieve "business thriving across the four seas, wealth abundant reaching the three rivers."

On the morning of December 25, Jiang Zemin listened to Chen Guangyi's report on the work of the Provincial Party Committee in Fuzhou and affirmed that Fujian's work in recent years has been good. During the suppression of the turmoil, the Provincial Party Committee had a clear stance and took appropriate measures, maintaining basic stability. This year, agriculture has been bountiful, new progress has been made in attracting foreign investment, and party building has been strengthened. The Central Committee is satisfied with Fujian's work. He emphasized that Fujian is a province implementing comprehensive reform and opening up, with a very important strategic position. He hoped that Fujian Province would continue to reform and open up, making it faster and better. Attracting foreign investment, in addition to small and medium-sized projects, should undertake some large-scale projects. The legal system and policies for foreign cooperation should be improved. The line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee should be maintained and continued, and the series of policies for reform and opening up will not change. Finally, he emphasized that at present, it is necessary to generally improve the level of Marxism among cadres, and at least there should be a group of cadres nationwide who truly understand Marxism. The main leading cadres of county-level and above units should have at least a basic level of Marxism. If this can be achieved, our party will be invincible.

During his stay in Fujian, Jiang Zemin specially visited the troops stationed in Fujian and inspected the grassroots units and sentry posts. He, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, extended cordial greetings to the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have made great contributions to defending the country's maritime defense and supporting Fujian's construction, and to the retired comrades. He encouraged them to further strengthen the revolutionary, modern, and regular construction of the army and make new achievements in promoting reform and opening up and defending the Four Modernizations.

Accompanying Jiang Zemin on his inspection and research in Fujian were Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission Sheng Shuren, Vice Secretary-General of the State Council and Director of the State Council's Special Zone Office He Qinling, Vice Director of the General Political Department of the PLA Yu Yongbo, Deputy Director of the Central Office Zeng Qinghong, and Deputy Director of the Central Policy Research Office Wei Jianlin.

    江泽民在福建调查时提出
    把沿海改革开放搞得更快更好些
    一再强调要温故而知新，发扬革命传统，加强思想建设
    本报福州12月26日电　本报记者张铭清、福建日报记者张黎洲、新华社记者许一鸣报道：中共中央总书记、中央军委主席江泽民最近在福建省调查研究时强调，要坚持改革，扩大开放，把沿海地区的改革开放搞得更快更好些。
    江泽民总书记是12月22日抵达福建的。在22日至25日期间，由省委书记陈光毅、省长王兆国陪同，先后视察闽西老革命根据地、漳州市、厦门经济特区和福州市。
    闽西老区是当年中央苏区的重要组成部分。江泽民同志到闽西老区龙岩时，正值著名的古田会议召开六十周年。他走下飞机，已是上午十一时半，顾不上休息，就风尘仆仆驱车200多公里赶到上杭县古田镇，瞻仰古田会议会址。“古田会议永放光芒”八个大字，掩映在树丛中，显得格外醒目。总书记走进古田会议会址，十几位曾为人民解放作过卓越贡献的老红军、老游击队员、老赤卫队员、老接头户、老干部代表，笑容满面地迎上前来。总书记同他们亲切握手，表示问候。他拉着年逾八旬的老赤卫队员雷德才的手，深情地说：“我是代表党中央来看望你们的，来向你们学习的！”随后，总书记又来到古田会议纪念馆，参观各种珍贵革命文物。在写着当年毛泽东同志亲自起草的《古田会议决议案》的展厅前，江泽民同志聚精会神地逐条阅读，他说：这些内容现在仍然适用，我们抓党的建设，抓军队建设，抓思想政治工作，就要按古田会议精神去做。临走时，总书记挥笔写了“继承和发扬古田会议精神，加强党和军队的建设”的题词。在调查研究途中，他一再强调要温故而知新，发扬革命传统，加强思想建设。江泽民同志说，毛主席等老一辈无产阶级革命家，在当时那样艰苦的环境，就十分重视调查研究，密切联系群众，总结建党建军初期思想建设的经验。这个决议今天仍闪烁着灿烂的思想光辉，仍需要好好学习和贯彻。实行改革开放以来，我们强调在学习西方先进科学技术和管理经验的同时，要自觉抵制资产阶级腐朽思想。看来只提抵制不够，不能光是防御，还一定要用马克思主义占领阵地。正如毛泽东同志说的，对于思想阵地，无产阶级思想不去占领，资产阶级思想必然要去占领。我们一定要向广大干部群众宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想，在党内开展积极的思想斗争，纠正各种错误思想。
    在八十年代初，江泽民同志曾参与规划并亲自指导过厦门经济特区的建设。时隔多年，他欣喜地看到厦门发生了巨大的变化。在厦门特区起步的湖里工业区，总书记先后到鹭美存储盘片有限公司、三德兴工业有限公司、厦华电子有限公司等中外合资企业调查研究，详细询问了生产、经营和销售情况。随后又同九家“三资”企业总经理一起座谈。他和这些来自美、日、新加坡等国家和港澳地区的企业家们谈笑风生。在认真听取了这些企业的发展情况介绍后，他强调指出：中国的改革开放的方针决不会因今年六月的政治风波而改变，因为我们对外开放的总设计师是邓小平同志，从实施开放的那天起，就明确规定必须沿着社会主义的方向发展。我们坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，不但丝毫不妨碍国外投资者的利益，而只会保证投资业务更好地进行，使改革开放搞得更快更好。
    几位企业家听着江泽民总书记的讲话，都连连点头，表示理解。江泽民接着对他们说：我国经济特区前景广阔，发展潜力很大，欢迎更多的外国投资者，海外侨胞、港澳同胞前来投资办厂。我认为，要使中外合作得更好，一是要相互了解，二是要相互信任，三是要相互有利，四是要有长远考虑。只要投资双方都按这四条原则办事，无论合资、独资企业都一定能办好。请相信我国改革开放会搞得越来越好，祝愿你们真正做到“生意兴隆通四海，财源茂盛达三江”。
    12月25日上午，江泽民同志在福州听取陈光毅汇报省委工作后，肯定了福建近年来的工作是做得好的。在制止动乱中省委旗帜鲜明，措施得当，保持了局势的基本稳定。今年农业丰收，吸收外资取得了新进展，在党的建设方面也抓得紧，中央对福建的工作是满意的。他强调指出，福建是实行综合改革和对外开放的省份，战略地位十分重要。希望福建省改革开放一是要坚持下去，二是要搞得更快更好。吸收外商来投资，除中小型项目以外，要搞一些像样的大项目。对外合作的法制、政策要完善。要保持十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策的稳定性和连续性，改革和对外开放的一系列政策都不变。最后他强调，当前，要普遍提高干部的马克思主义水平，至少全国要有一批干部真正懂得马克思主义，县以上单位的主要领导干部都要具备起码的马克思主义水平。如果能这样，我们这个党就能攻无不克，战无不胜。
    江泽民同志在福建期间，还特地看望了驻闽部队指战员，并视察了基层连队和哨所。他代表党中央、国务院、中央军委亲切慰问了为保卫祖国海防、支援福建建设作出重大贡献的人民解放军广大指战员和离退休老同志，勉励他们进一步加强部队的革命化、现代化、正规化建设，为促进改革开放、保卫四化建设再立新功。
    随同江泽民总书记到福建调查研究的有：农业部部长何康、国家计委副主任盛树仁、国务院副秘书长兼国务院特区办主任何椿霖、解放军总政治部副主任于永波、中央办公厅副主任曾庆红、中央政策研究室副主任卫建林。
