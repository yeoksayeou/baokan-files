Tang Dynasty historian Li Zhao's "Tang History Supplement" contains a story about the bribery of Cui Zhao, which is quite thought-provoking.

The story goes: Kui Ji, when young, had an uncle who was an official (name not recorded). The uncle had high expectations. One day, Kui Ji visited his aunt's house. As his uncle returned from the court, he sighed deeply, saying, "Who is Cui Zhao? Everyone praises him highly. This must be because he bribes people. How can things not be chaotic like this?" Before he finished speaking, the gatekeeper reported that the governor of Shouzhou, Cui, was waiting to see him. The uncle angrily scolded the gatekeeper and was about to beat him. After a long time, he reluctantly dressed up and went out. Soon, he ordered tea to be served urgently, then ordered wine and food, and then ordered the horse to be fed and the servants to be fed. His aunt said, "Why were you so arrogant before and so respectful after?" As soon as he entered the door, he had a look of satisfaction and greeted Kui Ji, saying, "Please rest in the study." Kui Ji had not yet descended the steps when he took out a piece of paper from his pocket, which was Cui's gift of a thousand bolts of official cloth.

The attitude of Kui Ji's uncle can be said to have changed dramatically. At first, upon hearing that Cui Zhao was visiting, he immediately became angry and even transferred his anger to the gatekeeper, showing off his arrogance. However, in an instant, he urgently ordered his family to serve tea, prepare wine and food, and even showed kindness to Cui Zhao's horse and servants.

It was truly "arrogant before, respectful after," like two different people!

What is worth pondering is that this official did not seem to be a careless person. He could deduce from the phenomenon of "everyone praising him highly" that Cui Zhao must be a briber, which shows his keen observational skills. He was also not a soft-hearted person. His initial arrogant attitude towards Cui Zhao seemed to indicate his firm stance of "hating evil like hating poison." He also did not seem to be a mediocre person. The sigh "how can things not be chaotic like this" was clearly expressing his "concern for the country and the people." However, all these beautiful, precious, and respectable performances were, after all, not real things for him, but only some veils. When Cui Zhao presented the gift of "a thousand bolts of official cloth," it was like a gust of wind sweeping away the clouds, instantly disappearing without a trace, leaving only his original face of hypocrisy.

That Cui Zhao, of course, was not a noble person. In today's terms, he was just a big briber. He just deeply understood the immense power of money, especially knowing whom to bribe. This was the secret of his gaining "universal praise." As for that high-ranking official who was originally "highly respected," he actually forgot everything and fell for Cui Zhao's so-called "gift," which is really sad, regrettable, and deeply thought-provoking.

    发人深省的“前倨后恭”
    钦鸿
    唐代李肇的《唐国史补》里，有一则崔昭行贿的故事，很有一读之价值。
    故事曰：裴佶“少时姑父为朝官（不记名姓），有雅望。佶至宅看其姑，会其朝退，深叹曰：‘崔昭何人，众口称美，此必行贿者也。如此安得不乱？’言未竟，阍者报寿州崔使君候谒。姑父怒呵阍者，将鞭之。良久，束带强出。须臾，命茶甚急，又命酒馔，又命秣马、饭仆。姑曰：‘前何倨而后何恭也？’及入门，有得色，揖佶曰：‘且憩学院中。’佶未下阶，出怀中一纸，乃昭赠官絁千匹。”
    裴佶姑父的态度可说是风云突变了。开始，一听说崔昭来访，他便勃然变色，甚至迁“怒”于看门的家人，摆足了架子后，才勉强出去接见；然而顷刻之间，却又急急命家人递茶、设酒，甚至恩及于崔昭的坐骑和仆人。
    真是“前倨后恭”，判若两人！
    值得玩味的是，这位朝廷命官似乎并不是一个马大哈，他能够从“众口称美”的现象中，作出崔昭“必行贿者”的判断，可见其观察力的锐敏；他也并不是一个老好人，开始他对崔昭所持的倨傲态度，似乎表明他有着“嫉恶如仇”的坚定立场；他似乎更不是一个碌碌之辈，那“如此安得不乱”的慨叹，不是分明抒发了他的“忧国忧民”的情怀？然而，这一切美好的、可贵的、令人尊敬的表现，对他来说，毕竟不是什么实在的东西，而只是些遮面的轻纱，当崔昭的“官絁千匹”的礼品一献于前，就像风卷残云一样，立刻被刮得无影无踪，剩下的只是他原来的那张势利面孔了。
    那个崔昭，当然不是什么高人。拿今天的话来说，他不过是一个大行贿犯而已。只是，他深深懂得钱财有着多么巨大的神威，尤其懂得应该向什么样的人去行贿。这就是他获得“众口称美”的奥秘所在。而那个身居高位、素“有雅望”的朝廷命官，居然也会忘乎一切、倾倒于崔昭的所谓“馈赠”之下，实在是可以使人悲之、叹之，并且深长思之的。
