The Dafen Supply and Marketing Machinery Factory in Jiangsu Province has been improving the quality of its existing products while continuously developing new ones, relying on the superior quality of its products to capture the market. From January to November this year, this small enterprise with only 2.8 million yuan in fixed assets achieved a production value of 8.56 million yuan and realized a profit and tax of 1.56 million yuan, setting a new historical high.

This factory is a key producer of cotton processing machinery in the country, with its main products including cotton gin machines, cotton roll machines, and milling machines, all of which have ranked at the forefront in national industry inspections and evaluations. To ensure quality, they adhere to the principle of not using substandard raw materials and not allowing substandard products to leave the factory. Based on feedback from users in cotton-producing areas, they have carried out technical improvements on old products, adding dust prevention and waste removal systems and safety devices.

To reduce costs, the Dafen Supply and Marketing Machinery Factory has also taken a series of solid and effective measures in production and management. From January to November this year, they increased revenue and savings by more than 1.5 million yuan, absorbing the impact of raw material price increases, and keeping product prices stable at the 1987 level. The low selling price of their products has made them popular among users.

    大丰供销机械厂立足市场
    本报讯　江苏省大丰县供销机械厂在提高老产品质量的同时，不断开发新产品，靠产品质量过硬占领市场。今年1至11月份，这个仅有280万元固定资产的小企业，创产值856万元，实现利税156万元，创历史最高水平。
    这个厂是全国棉花加工机械的重点生产厂家，主产品剥绒机、轧花机和铣齿机，均在全国同行业检查评比中名列前茅。为了把好质量关，他们坚持不合格的原料不投产，不合格的产品不出厂。根据产棉区用户的意见，对老产品进行技术改造，同时增加了防尘排杂系统和安全装置。
    大丰县供销机械厂为了降低成本，在生产环节上和经营管理上还采取了一系列扎实有效的措施。今年1至11月份增收节支150多万元，自我消化了原材料涨价因素，使产品价格一直稳定在1987年的水平上。产品售价低，深受用户欢迎。
