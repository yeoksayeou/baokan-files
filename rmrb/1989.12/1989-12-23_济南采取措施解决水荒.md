Jinan, known as the "City of Springs," has seen its groundwater level drop to an all-time low due to consecutive years of drought. It is reported that the city's daily water shortage this winter and next spring could reach 250,000 cubic meters at its peak, equivalent to one-fifth of the normal water supply. Facing such a severe water shortage, the Jinan municipal government recently issued an urgent appeal to all citizens: everyone must strengthen their water-saving awareness and implement water-saving targets.

Jinan's water resources are severely scarce, but water wastage is rampant.

In response, the municipal government has stipulated that residential water supply will be rationed, and the following main measures will be taken: implementing a water-saving target responsibility system in all enterprises and institutions, ensuring that water-saving targets are met at the workshop, team, and individual levels; strengthening the planning and management of water use and pipeline maintenance to fundamentally eliminate water leakage, seepage, dripping, and wasting; promoting the use of advanced water-saving technologies and water-saving appliances; and imposing penalties, reducing water quotas, and even cutting off water supply for those who waste water repeatedly and fail to correct their behavior.

    济南采取措施解决水荒
    本报济南12月22日电　记者贾建舟报道：号称“泉城”的济南市，地下水位由于连年干旱已降至历史最低点。据悉，今冬明春全市日缺水量最高时将达25万立方米，相当于正常供水量的2／5。面对如此严重的水荒，济南市政府日前向全市市民发出紧急呼吁：人人强化节水意识，个个落实节水指标。
    济南市水资源严重奇缺，但浪费水触目惊心。
    鉴此，市政府规定，今后居民生活用水限量供应，并采取以下主要措施：在各企事业单位推行节水目标责任制，把节水指标层层落实到车间、班组和个人；加强对用水的计划管理和管线维修，从根本上杜绝跑、冒、滴、漏现象；大力采用先进的节水技术和节水器具；对浪费严重而又屡教不改者，采取罚款、压缩用水指标、直至停止供水等惩处。
