South Korea Sentences Seo Kyung-won to Fifteen Years in Prison

Former South Korean National Assembly member Seo Kyung-won, who was arrested for visiting North Korea, was sentenced to fifteen years in prison by the Seoul District Court on the 20th for violating the National Security Law. Additionally, he was fined 33 million South Korean won (approximately $50,000 USD).

According to reports, Seo Kyung-won was a member of the National Assembly for the largest opposition party in South Korea, the New Democratic Party. In June of this year, the South Korean Agency for National Security Planning announced that Seo Kyung-won had secretly visited North Korea in August 1988. Subsequently, the South Korean authorities revoked Seo Kyung-won's membership in the National Assembly, and the New Democratic Party expelled him from the party.

    南朝鲜判处徐敬元十五年徒刑
    因访问朝鲜北方而被捕的前南朝鲜国会议员徐敬元二十日被汉城法院以违反《国家保安法》为由，判处十五年徒刑，并处以三千三百多万南朝鲜元（约合五万美元）的罚款。
    据报道，徐敬元原是南朝鲜最大的在野党平民党的国会议员。今年六月，南朝鲜安全企划部宣称徐敬元于一九八八年八月曾秘密访问了朝鲜北方。随后，南朝鲜当局取消了徐敬元的国会议员资格，并迫使平民党开除了他的党籍。
