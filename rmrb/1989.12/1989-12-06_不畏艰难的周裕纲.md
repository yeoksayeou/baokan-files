In less than three months, he won the gold medal at the 1988 Beijing International Invention Exhibition, the gold medal at the Guangzhou International Patent and Technology Exhibition, the Golden Dragon Flying Award at the Ministry of Light Industry's Science and Technology Week, and the Governor's Special Award from Hebei Province. The gleaming medals, however, tell only part of the story of Zhou Yugang's long struggle and the hardships he endured.

Facing Dongting Lake, he was moved

In 1969, Zhou Yugang and his family were sent to the Yueyang Paper Mill in Hunan Province as part of a design institute's relocation from Beijing. Seeing the paper mill on the shores of Dongting Lake, using large amounts of clean water from the lake and then discharging polluted water back into it, he was heartbroken. He decided then to tackle the problem of paper mill pollution.

From that point on, he dedicated himself to experimentation. In the summer heat, he worked shirtless, sweating profusely, and in the winter cold, he wrapped himself in an old quilted jacket, trudging through water and mud to collect samples. The wind blew his hat into the drainage ditch, and his daughter, who had come to bring him lunch, cried in fright. People advised him to take a break for a day or two, but Zhou Yugang insisted, "Scientific experiments cannot afford any negligence. Bad weather is a good opportunity to observe the effects of various factors on the inclined tube sedimentation and to select useful reference data."

Chinese people can do it!

The production trial was basically completed, and new research topics were urgently needed. Just then, a series of heavy blows fell on Zhou Yugang. First, the technical measures fund of the Yueyang Paper Mill was canceled, cutting off the source of experimental funds. Then, family conflicts escalated, mediation failed, and his wife left him, leaving him to care for a young daughter. The most unbearable blow was that, due to differing opinions, the Yueyang Paper Mill and the leader of his professional team refused to let him continue his on-site experiments.

Zhou Yugang sought help everywhere.

In letters to provincial leaders and the provincial political consultative conference, he poured out his heart: "If the Chinese people are to stand tall on this earth, we need science and technology! I was trained by the Party and the state, received a salary to attend university, learned technology, and now I can still do some work in scientific research, so why..."

During the investigation by higher authorities, someone said, "The problem Zhou Yugang wants to solve has not been solved by foreign experts, can he do it?" But Zhou Yugang's response was, "Just because foreigners haven't solved a problem doesn't mean Chinese people can't! No matter what difficulties we encounter, I will persist in this research."

Self-reliance and hard work

After careful evaluation, the Hunan Provincial Economic Commission and the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau quickly approved Zhou Yugang's research project and allocated funds, supporting the continuation of the experiments. At the Xidu Paper Mill construction site in Hengyang City, various experiments quickly proceeded smoothly.

The isolation board purification tank, which can magically remove floating oil, floating sludge, and troublesome microbubbles; the turbulence collision flow box, which uses baffle walls to achieve three functions in one tank; the sedimentation hopper, which, after simple and ingenious modifications, increases the pulp recovery concentration; and the small pipe, known as the "Monkey King's head" for its five functions in one component, were all carefully designed and manufactured here and put into use one after another.

Among the many components, the most difficult to process was the co-current flow separator. No one was willing to process it, so Zhou Yugang decided to do it himself! He found a small factory near a large factory and borrowed the technical strength of the large factory to work together. He learned as he worked. Day and night, without rest, Zhou Yugang led a group of enthusiastic craftsmen, and they finally "carved out" the co-current flow separator.

Benefiting the country and society

On July 30, 1987, the Hunan Provincial Light Industry Department invited experts and scholars from relevant fields to gather at Xidu to evaluate the new technology and equipment for comprehensive wastewater treatment and recovery used in the paper mill, which had been running for more than two years. The conclusion was: the process flow is novel and reasonable, and the technology is advanced. The entire device is compact, occupies less land, has low operating costs, and has significant environmental benefits. The three main technical indicators of water consumption per ton of paper, the quality of recycled water, and the pulp recovery rate all exceeded the advanced level of the early 1980s abroad.

Comparative data showed that in the early 1980s, foreign countries used closed-loop technology to produce one ton of paper, requiring 20 tons of fresh water. Using Zhou Yugang's technology and equipment, only 3 tons of fresh water are needed at most. Moreover, the turbidity of the reused water is much lower than that specified by a famous international paper company in the United States. Foreign wood pulp paper production has an easy-to-recover pulp, with the highest recovery rate of 90%, while using the Xidu process and equipment, suitable for China's grass pulp paper wastewater, the pulp recovery rate is above 96%. The Baoding First Paper Mill introduced Zhou Yugang's technology, saving just water alone, can save more than 400,000 yuan a year. Including other benefits, the investment can be recovered in less than a year. The Dandong Paper Mill, which had just introduced paper-making equipment from Sweden, also did the math. Using this equipment to treat the incoming water and make paper, the quality can be improved by one level. In one year, this benefit alone can reach six or seven million yuan.

    不畏艰难的周裕纲
    王子强
    他，在3个月不到的时间里，连获1988年北京国际发明展览会金牌奖、广州国际专利及技术展览会金牌奖、轻工部科技活动周金龙腾飞奖和河北省省长特别奖。奖牌金光闪耀，人们可曾知道奖牌获得者——周裕纲老人多年来为此付出的代价和他走过的艰辛道路。
    面对洞庭湖，他动情了
    1969年，周裕纲一家跟随设计院，从首都下放到湖南岳阳造纸厂。看到坐落在八百里洞庭湖畔的造纸厂一边耗用着湖里大量清水，一边又把滚滚的浊水排向湖里，大片湖区遭受污染。他心疼了，萌发出要治理造纸污水的念头。
    从此，他全身心地投身试验。夏季酷热，他光着膀子，挥汗如雨，坚持工作；冬季寒风凛冽，湖边有时结冰，他把老棉袄往身上一裹，踩着水和泥，提着热水化冻取样。大风把棉帽刮落到排水沟中，前来送饭的女儿吓得直哭。人们也劝他停一两天再试验，周裕纲却固执地说：“科学实验容不得半点疏忽。天气不好，正好观察各种因素对斜管沉淀效果的影响，从中筛选有用的参考数据。”
    中国人咋不行
    生产性试验基本完成，新的研究课题亟待展开。正在这时，一连串沉重的打击落在周裕纲身上。先是岳阳造纸厂的技措费被取消，切断了试验经费来源。接着是家庭矛盾加剧，调解无效，老伴和他离了婚，留下一个年幼的女儿要他照顾。最使他难以承受的是，由于意见分歧，岳阳造纸厂和他所在的专业组领导不准他再去现场搞实验了。
    周裕纲四处奔波求告。
    在写给省领导、省政协的信里，他剖心直书：“中国人要在地球上站起来，没有科学技术是不行的！我是党和国家一手培养成人的，带着工资上了大学，学了技术，现在还可以在科研上做点工作，为什么要……”
    在上级派人调查此事过程中，有人说：“周裕纲要解决的问题，外国专家都没有解决，他能行？”可周裕纲的回答是：“外国人没有解决的问题，中国人不一定不能解决！不管遇到什么困难，我都要把这项研究坚持下去。”
    自己动手，艰苦奋斗
    经过认真评议，湖南省经委、省环保局很快为周裕纲研究的课题立项、拨款，支持试验继续进行。在衡阳市西渡造纸厂工地上，各项试验很快地顺利展开。
    那个像变魔术一样能把浮油、浮渣和令人十分头痛的微气泡，轻易清除的隔板净化池；那个采用了湍流碰撞，设置了整流墙，实现了一池三用的整流箱；那个经过简单、巧妙地改进，提高了浆料回收浓度的积浆斗；还有那个神通广大，一个部件五种功能，被人们称作“悟空头”的小套管，都是在这里精心构思，精心制作，先后投入使用的。
    在制作众多部件中，数加工心胜部位——同向流分离器最困难。人家不愿加工，周裕纲横下一条心，自己动手干！他找到一家靠近大工厂的乡办小厂，借用大厂的技术力量一起攻关。边学边干。就这样，夜以继日，不辞劳苦，周裕纲带领一帮热心的师傅，硬是把同流分离器“抠”了出来。造福国家造福社会
    1987年7月30日，湖南省轻工厅邀请有关方面专家、学者聚会西渡，对运行了两年多的造纸车间综合排水回收利用新工艺、新设备进行了省级鉴定。结论是：工艺流程新颖合理，技术先进。整个装置紧凑，占地面积少，运行费用低，环境效益明显。吨纸耗水量、回收水的质量和浆料回收率三大主要技术指标，都超过了国外80年代初的先进水平。
    对比资料表明，80年代初国外采用封闭循环工艺，造1吨纸需耗用新鲜水20吨，而采用周裕纲的工艺、设备，最多只需用新鲜水3吨。而且回用水浑浊度大大低于美国一家有名的国际造纸公司规定的浑浊度。国外木浆造纸，浆料易回收，回收率最高为90％，而用西渡的工艺、设备，适用我国草浆造纸废水，浆料回收率在96％以上。保定第一造纸厂引进周裕纲的工艺，仅节约水一项，一年就可节约40多万元。加上其它收益，投资不到一年就可收回。刚刚从瑞典引进造纸设备的丹东造纸厂，也算了一笔帐，用这套设备处理来水后造的纸，质量可以上一个等级。一年下来，仅此一项收益即达六七百万元。
