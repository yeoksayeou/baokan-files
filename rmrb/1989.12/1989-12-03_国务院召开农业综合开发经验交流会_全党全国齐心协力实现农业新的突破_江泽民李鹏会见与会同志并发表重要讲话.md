The State Council held a conference on the exchange of experiences in agricultural comprehensive development. The entire Party and the nation will work together to achieve new breakthroughs in agriculture. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng met with attendees and delivered important speeches.

Beijing, December 2 (Xinhua) — General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin and Premier of the State Council Li Peng met with delegates from various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and municipalities with separate planning status who attended the national conference on agricultural comprehensive development experience exchange on the afternoon of December 1 in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai. They listened to reports and delivered important speeches on China's rural work and agricultural development issues.

The conference, organized by the State Council, primarily aims to implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, summarize and exchange experiences in agricultural comprehensive development nationwide, and study how to improve agricultural comprehensive development. It also discusses and deploys rural work for the coming year according to the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session.

Jiang Zemin's speech consists of four parts:

1. Summarizing experiences, raising awareness, and firmly establishing the guiding ideology that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy.

Over the past decade, China's rural reforms and construction have achieved remarkable results that have attracted global attention. However, in the past five years, major agricultural products such as grain and cotton have faced a serious stagnation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has long reminded us that if agriculture encounters problems, it will take many years to recover. Comrade Chen Yun also warned in 1985 that "without agriculture, there is no stability" and "without grain, there is chaos." However, their words did not receive the attention they deserved from the entire Party. The current issue is to seriously summarize experiences, affirm achievements, learn from lessons, find solutions, and strengthen our confidence to continue moving forward.

The agricultural issue is not just a major economic problem but also a major political problem. If agriculture does not develop, the entire national economy cannot achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development. If the countryside is unstable, the entire country and society will find it difficult to maintain stability. We must recognize agriculture from this height, value it, and strengthen agricultural and rural work.

The purpose of summarizing experiences and raising awareness is to firmly establish and persistently adhere to the guiding ideology that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy throughout the entire Party and the nation. This guiding ideology must be genuinely implemented in actual work and must not be shaken at any time.

2. The entire Party and the nation must truly mobilize to achieve new breakthroughs in agricultural development.

To achieve new breakthroughs or reach a new level in the near term means to quickly end the current stagnant situation. Grain production should reach 850 to 900 billion jin (approximately 425 to 450 million metric tons), and cotton production should reach 90 to 100 million piculs (approximately 5.4 to 6 million metric tons). To achieve these goals, there are significant difficulties and arduous tasks, and we must have a full understanding.

This requires the formation of a nationwide wave of valuing, supporting, and developing agriculture throughout the entire Party and the nation.

It is particularly important to clarify this understanding: developing agriculture involves all departments and aspects, so it is not just the responsibility of the agricultural department but a collective effort requiring the participation of the entire Party, the nation, and all departments. The agricultural department must, of course, pay attention, but other departments must also pay considerable attention. They must take the initiative to act, work together, and cooperate closely. They must avoid mutual blame and shifting responsibility but instead understand and support each other.

True mobilization is not just about words, meetings, or general calls but about genuinely solving various practical problems and firmly implementing various tasks.

Special attention must be paid to the following three areas:

1. Stabilize and further improve the household contract responsibility system, and promote the development of appropriate scale management and various service systems in areas with conditions.
2. Promote and apply agricultural science and technology. There is great potential in this area. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "Ultimately, science may solve the problem." Everyone must work hard in this area.
3. Increase agricultural investment and strengthen the foundation. The central government must increase some investment. Local finances must also increase some investment. In recent years, farmers' incomes have increased rapidly, and they must be guided to invest more, especially to increase labor accumulation. This winter and next spring, a wave of agricultural water conservancy construction must be launched, but attention must be paid to benefits and engineering quality.

3. Strengthen the study of some major issues in agricultural and rural work.

To develop agriculture, long-term and arduous efforts are needed to study and solve many major problems. In addition to the aforementioned stabilization and improvement of the household contract responsibility system, development of appropriate scale management, strengthening of agricultural science and technology work, and increasing agricultural investment, the following issues must be studied and discussed in depth and systematically:

How to comprehensively develop agriculture; how to gradually strengthen the collective economic power in rural areas; how to adjust, rectify, transform, and improve township enterprises; how to protect and rationally utilize arable land; how to strengthen rural education and population control; how to maintain rural public security; how to strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization in rural areas; how to strengthen the construction of grassroots Party organizations and grassroots governments in rural areas, and improve political, economic, and administrative management efficiency; and how to formulate a unified plan for agricultural development, among others.

The depth of research and the effectiveness of solutions to these problems directly affect the stable development of agriculture and the overall progress of various undertakings in rural areas. Party committees and relevant departments at all levels must organize various forces to conduct in-depth investigations, conduct scientific analyses and repeated verifications based on extensive material collection, and produce a batch of research results.

4. To develop agriculture, cadres must go down to the countryside, improve their work style, and strengthen the leadership of rural work.

Cadres at all levels, including leading cadres, must frequently go to the countryside, understand the situation in the countryside, make friends with farmers, listen to their opinions, care about their difficulties, and discuss solutions with them. This is a fine tradition of our Party and a reliable guarantee for doing a good job in rural work.

In recent years, many places and departments, especially leading cadres, have gone to the countryside less and issued orders from above more, providing less actual help to the masses. If these situations are not corrected, they are very dangerous.

Recently, the situation has changed, and many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have led their cadres to the countryside. Some have even gone to agricultural water conservancy construction sites to work with the masses. Some provinces have decided to send a large number of cadres to the countryside this winter and next spring to conduct investigations, help with work, and carry out socialist education. This is good, and it is hoped that all places and departments will do the same and persist.

Cadres must genuinely go down to the grassroots. Even if the masses have some grievances, they will be easier to resolve.

Especially at the county and township levels, the main focus and work center must be on agriculture and rural work. The new experiences and problems in the implementation of various rural policies of the Party and the government must be studied in a timely manner, good experiences must be summarized and promoted, existing problems must be seriously solved, and new policy suggestions must be proposed. This is our old tradition, and history has proven it to be correct, and it must be persisted.

Premier Li Peng said that agricultural comprehensive development is a path to develop agriculture, including the utilization of new resources and the transformation of medium and low-yield fields to improve yields. Each place must proceed according to local conditions and promote both simultaneously.

Regarding the agricultural situation, Li Peng said that although Northeast China experienced a severe drought, this year's national harvest was better than last year, with a total grain output of 810 billion jin. This shows that as long as the entire Party values agriculture and takes effective measures, agriculture still has great potential. This has increased our confidence in developing agriculture and has contributed to the stable development of the economy in the next two years. Having grain in hand means having no worries in mind. We highly evaluate and are very grateful for the efforts and contributions made by farmers and cadres at all levels involved in agriculture.

Li Peng said that developing agriculture relies on policy, science and technology, and investment, which is an old saying. The old saying must be reiterated but with new meanings. The household contract responsibility system must be stable and continue to be implemented, which is an important measure to protect farmers' enthusiasm. However, staying at this level and relying solely on the household contract responsibility system is not enough for agriculture to reach a new level. In areas with conditions, implementing the dual-management system is feasible. The establishment and development of the service system rely on the support and organization of governments at all levels. Party committees and governments at all levels must give sufficient attention and guidance. The service system plays to the advantages of the collective economy, while the household contract responsibility system maintains farmers' enthusiasm. The combination of the two can play a greater role. This service system is for the service of farmers and will definitely be welcomed by farmers.

When discussing township enterprises and individual industrial and commercial businesses in rural areas, Li Peng said that legal operations must be protected, and illegal operations must be restricted and eliminated. The policy of appropriately developing township enterprises must be affirmed. Township enterprises have increased farmers' economic income, arranged surplus labor in rural areas, and contributed wealth to the country. Township enterprises must be guided according to the country's industrial policy, and those that should be supported must be supported. The country is reducing the scale of basic construction, and some workers have returned to their hometowns. Each place must organize and arrange them to engage in agricultural water conservancy construction and fine farming.

Li Peng pointed out that the promotion of agricultural science and technology is a big issue. We have many good and relatively mature agricultural research results suitable for China's national conditions, but many are still in laboratories and experimental fields. The promotion of agricultural science and technology requires solving the issue of investment; solving the issue of agricultural science and technology teams going deep into rural areas; and conducting scientific and technological education and training for farmers. Rural education must include agricultural vocational education to consolidate and develop rural education and promote the promotion of agricultural technology.

Li Peng said that everyone is concerned about the issue of agricultural investment. Investment requires efforts from all parties. There is government investment, social investment, and investment from the masses, including farmers' labor investment. The masses are the main body of investment. Various economic policies such as prices, taxes, and loans must play a guiding role and guide farmers to invest more. Next year, the central government's investment in agriculture must strive to increase, mainly for the treatment of major rivers, large-scale water conservancy construction, agricultural industrial construction, and the start-up fee for large-scale agricultural development.

Li Peng said that the lifeline of Chinese agriculture is water conservancy, and all agricultural development areas are related to water treatment. Developing agriculture without solving the water problem is not possible. On one hand, water resources must be developed, and on the other hand, water-saving agriculture must be promoted. Water-saving agriculture has low investment, quick results, and great potential. In addition, attention must be paid to scientific fertilization, improving fertilizer efficiency, using more organic fertilizer, and implementing straw returning to the field to restore and maintain soil fertility.

Li Peng emphasized that all industries must support agriculture, including material and financial departments, coal, electricity supply departments, and this year's fertilizer production situation is good. The specialized operation of agricultural production materials implemented since last year has more advantages than disadvantages. Specialized operation must be continued, but the system must be improved, and the service system must be further improved to facilitate farmers.

The report meeting was presided over by Vice Premier Tian Jiyun of the State Council.

State Councilor Chen Junsheng reported on the basic situation of this conference and the national agricultural comprehensive development, as well as several major issues reflected at the meeting. Delegates from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan provinces spoke at the meeting.

Leaders from relevant departments of the State Council attended the report meeting.

    国务院召开农业综合开发经验交流会
    全党全国齐心协力实现农业新的突破
    江泽民李鹏会见与会同志并发表重要讲话
    新华社北京12月2日电  （记者黄正根、王言彬）中共中央总书记江泽民、国务院总理李鹏12月1日下午在中南海怀仁堂亲切接见参加全国农业综合开发经验交流会的各省、市、自治区和计划单列市的带队同志，听取汇报，并对我国农村工作和农业发展问题作了重要讲话。
    由国务院主持召开的这次重要会议，主要是贯彻落实党的十三届五中全会精神，总结交流全国农业综合开发的经验，研究如何把全国农业综合开发搞得更好；同时，按照十三届五中全会的精神，讨论、部署明年的农村工作。
    江泽民同志的讲话分四个部分：
    一、总结经验，提高认识，牢固确立农业是国民经济基础的指导思想。
    10年来，我国农村的改革和建设取得了举世瞩目的成就。但是，近5年来主要农产品粮食、棉花出现了徘徊不前的严重局面。
    小平同志早就提醒我们，如果农业出了问题，多少年恢复不过来。陈云同志1985年也提醒过我们，“无农不稳”，“无粮则乱”。但是他们的话，没有引起全党应有的重视。现在的问题，是要认真总结经验，肯定成绩，吸取教训，找出对策，坚定继续前进的信心。
    农业问题不只是一大经济问题，也是一大政治问题。农业不发展，整个国民经济就不可能持续稳定协调发展。农村不稳定，整个国家和社会就很难稳定。我们要从这样的高度来认识农业，重视农业，加强农业和农村工作。
    总结经验，提高认识的目的，就是要在全党全国上下牢固确立和长期坚持农业是国民经济基础的指导思想。要把这个指导思想切切实实贯彻到实际工作中去。任何时候都动摇不得。
    二、全党全国要真正动员起来，齐心协力实现农业发展的新突破。
    在近期内实现新突破，或者说上一个新台阶，就是要尽快结束目前的徘徊局面。粮食要达到8500—9000亿斤，棉花要达到9000万到1亿担。要达到这个目标，困难很大，任务很艰巨，必须有充分的认识。
    这就要求在全党全国真正形成一个重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的热潮。
    特别要明确这样一个认识：发展农业涉及各个部门、各个方面，因此不仅仅是农业部门的事，而是需要全党全国和各个部门共同来办的事业。农业部门当然要重视，其他各个部门也要十分重视。要自觉行动起来，同心协力，密切配合。要注意不要互相埋怨，互相推诿，而要互相理解，互相支持。
    真正动员起来，不是停留在口头上、会议上、一般号召上，而是要切切实实解决各种实际问题，狠抓各项工作的落实。
    要特别注意从三个方面花力气，下功夫。
    一是抓承包责任制的稳定和进一步完善，抓有条件的地方适度规模经营的发展和各种服务体系的发展；
    二是抓农业科学技术的推广和应用。这方面潜力很大。小平同志说：“最终可能是科学解决问题”。大家要在这方面多下功夫；
    三是抓农业投入，增强后劲。中央要增加一些投入。地方财政也要多增加一些投入。这几年农民收入增加较快，要引导农民多投入，特别要引导农民增加劳动积累。今冬明春要掀起农田水利建设的热潮，当然要注意效益，注意工程质量。
    三、要加强对农业和农村工作中一些重大问题的研究。
    要把农业搞上去，需要进行长期的艰苦的努力，需要研究解决许多重大问题。除了上面说的稳定和完善承包责任制、发展适度规模经营、加强农业科技工作和增加农业投入以外，对于如何搞好农业的综合开发；如何逐步增强农村的集体经济力量；如何搞好乡镇企业的调整、整顿、改造、提高；如何保护好和合理利用耕地；如何加强农村教育和人口控制工作；如何搞好农村治安；如何加强农村的精神文明建设；如何加强农村基层党组织和基层政权建设，提高政治上、经济上、行政上的管理效能；以及如何制订农业发展的统一规划等等，都要抓紧进行认真的系统的探讨和研究。
    这些问题研究得透不透，解决得好不好，直接关系农业的稳定发展和农村各项事业的全面进步。各级党委和有关部门，要组织各方面的力量，深入调查，在广泛占有材料的基础上，进行科学分析和反复论证，拿出一批研究成果来。
    四、要把农业搞上去，干部要下去，要改进领导作风，切实加强对农村工作的领导。
    各级干部包括领导干部，经常下农村，了解农村情况，同农民交朋友，倾听他们的意见，关心他们的疾苦，同他们一块商量解决问题的办法。这是我们党的优良传统，也是我们做好农村工作的可靠保证。
    近几年来，我们不少地方和部门的干部，特别是领导干部下农村少了，浮在上面发号施令多了，给农民群众的实际帮助少了。这些情况如不纠正是很危险的。
    最近情况有了变化，不少省、市、自治区的各级领导干部带头到农村去，有的还到农田水利工地同群众一块劳动，有些省已决定今冬明春派一大批干部下农村调查研究，帮助工作，开展社会主义教育。这样就好了，希望各地各部门都这样做，并且坚持下去。干部真正深入下去了，群众即使有点怨气，也就容易消除了。
    特别是地、县两级的领导，要把主要精力和工作的重心，放到抓农业和农村工作上。要及时研究党和政府的各项农村政策，在贯彻执行中的新经验，新问题，总结推广好的经验，认真解决存在的问题，提出新的政策建议，这也是我们过去的老传统，历史证明是正确的，也要坚持下去。
    李鹏同志说，农业综合开发是一个发展农业的路子，既包括对新资源的利用，又包括对中低产田的改造，以提高单产。各地要因地制宜，两者同时并举。
    谈到农业形势，李鹏说，虽然东北遇到特大干旱，今年全国收成仍比去年好一些，粮食总产量达到8100亿斤。这说明，只要全党重视农业，采取有力措施，农业还是大有作为的，这给我们把农业搞上去增加了信心，也为今明两年的经济稳定发展作出了贡献。手中有粮，心中不慌。我们高度评价和非常感谢农民和各级搞农业的同志所作出的努力和贡献。
    李鹏说，发展农业，一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠投入是句老话。老话还得说，但要给予新的含义。家庭联产承包责任
  制要稳定不变，继续执行下去，这是保护农民积极性的重要措
  施。但是停留在这个水平上，只靠家庭联产承包责任制，农业要上新台阶是不够的。现在在有条件的地方实行双层经营体制是可行的。服务体系的建立和发展要靠各级政权部门的支持和组织，各级党委和政府都应给予足够的重视和引导。服务体系发挥集体经济的优越性，而家庭联产承包责任制保持了农民的积极性，两者相结合就能发挥出更大作用。这个服务体系是为农民服务的，一定会受到农民的欢迎。
    李鹏在谈到乡镇企业和农村个体工商业问题时说，对合法经营要保护，对非法经营要限制、取缔。适当发展乡镇企业的政策要肯定。乡镇企业增加了农民经济收入，安排了农村剩余的劳动力，为国家贡献了财富。对于乡镇企业，要按国家的产业政策给予引导，该支持的要支持。国家压缩基本建设规模，有一部分民工回乡，各地要组织安排好，动员他们搞农田水利基本建设和农业精耕细作。
    李鹏指出，农业科技推广是个大问题。我们有许多很好的、比较成熟的适合中国国情的农业科研成果，但很多还停留在实验室和试验田里面。农业科技推广一是要解决投入；二是要解决农业科技队伍深入农村的问题；三是要对农民进行科学技术教育、培训。农村的教育必须加上农业职业教育，这样才能巩固发展农村教育，并推动农技的推广。
    李鹏说，大家都很关心农业投入问题。投入要各方面努力。有政府的投入，有社会的投入，有农民群众的投入，包括农民劳务投入。农民群众投入是主体。各项经济政策如价格、税收、贷款等政策要起到导向作用，引导农民多投入。明年，中央对农业投资要争取增加一些，主要是用于大江大河的治理、大型水利建设、农用工业建设、大面积农业开发启动费等。
    李鹏说，中国农业的命脉是水利，农业的开发区都与治水有关。发展农业不解决水的问题不行，一方面是开发水的资源，另一方面是搞节水农业。节水农业投入少、见效快，又有很大潜力。另外还要注意科学施肥，提高肥效，多采用农家肥，实行秸秆还田，恢复和保持地力。
    李鹏强调说，各行各业都要支援农业，包括物资、金融部门，煤、电供应等部门，今年化肥生产情况是好的。农业生产资料专营从去年以来实行的情况看利大于弊。专营要坚持下去，但制度要完善，要进一步改善服务体系，方便农民。
    汇报会由国务院副总理田纪云主持。
