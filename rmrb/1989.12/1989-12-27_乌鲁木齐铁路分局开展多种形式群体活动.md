The Urumqi Railway Bureau has been consistently promoting various forms of mass sports activities over the past few years, achieving remarkable results. These activities have played a significant role in enhancing the physical fitness of the workers and boosting their enthusiasm for production.

The Urumqi Railway Bureau, with over 23,000 employees, manages more than 800 kilometers of railway lines, including the notorious "Hundred-Mile Wind Zone," "Thirty-Mile Wind Gap," and vast deserts, all of which are well-known for their harsh and dangerous conditions. Since 1982, the bureau has tailored its sports activities to suit the long railway lines, numerous stations, and dispersed workforce. They have established sports associations at the bureau and station levels, with leaders actively participating in these activities. Subsequently, they formed over ten single-sport associations.

    乌鲁木齐铁路分局开展多种形式群体活动
    新华社乌鲁木齐12月26日电（通讯员韩辉、记者姜武志）乌鲁木齐铁路分局几年来坚持开展多种形式的群众体育活动，取得显著成绩，对提高职工身体素质和调动群众生产积极性起到重要作用。
    拥有23000多名职工的乌鲁木齐铁路分局，管辖着800多公里的漫长铁路线，管区内有“百里风区”、“三十里风口”和茫茫戈壁等全国闻名的艰苦险恶路段。自1982年以来，这个分局根据线路长、点多和职工分散的特点，因地制宜开展各种群众喜闻乐见的体育活动。他们首先在分局和各站段都成立了体协组织，领导带头参加体育活动。此后，又建立了10多个单项体育协会。
