One of the ten largest enterprises in the country, the Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Company, has relied on deepening reforms, strengthening management, and tapping into potential to overcome difficulties. By December 29, despite absorbing over 300 million yuan in reduced profit factors, the company achieved profits and taxes exceeding 1.8 billion yuan, surpassing the state plan by 150 million yuan.

Throughout this year, Yanshan Petrochemical, like many enterprises nationwide, has faced severe challenges in funding, raw materials, transportation, energy, and foreign exchange. In the face of these difficulties, the leadership and all employees at Yanshan Petrochemical have not passively waited but have instead relied on deepening reforms, streamlining internal relations, and leveraging the advantages of joint enterprises to increase overall benefits, creating an additional 50 million yuan in benefits for the year. They have actively adjusted the product structure, increased the production of scarce and marketable chemical products, and in areas such as material allocation, operations, sales, and management, identified 20 key projects to achieve rational allocation of production factors, minimizing input and maximizing output, with significant results.
