North Korea condemns U.S. for shipping new tanks to South Korea

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 13 - The Secretariat of the North Korean Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on December 12, strongly condemning the recent shipment of new tanks by the United States to South Korea.

According to the Associated Press, the United States recently shipped a batch of M-1A1 new tanks to South Korea. These new tanks, planned for the U.S. Army's 2nd Infantry Division stationed in South Korea, have high mobility and can quickly move to any necessary location.

The statement from the Secretariat of the North Korean Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said that North Korea, for the purpose of eliminating war and consolidating peace on the Korean Peninsula, has proposed holding three-party talks involving North and South Korea and the United States. North Korea has also unilaterally reduced its military by 100,000 personnel and mobilized 150,000 military personnel for economic construction. However, the United States has not only refused to accept the North's peace proposals but has continued to instigate confrontation between the North and the South, making dialogue between the two sides difficult. This time, by deploying high-performance tanks in U.S. military units near the demilitarized zone, the United States is challenging the Korean people who hope for national peace and peaceful reunification. The statement strongly protests this and demands that the United States immediately stop its activities to strengthen military forces in South Korea.

Regarding the U.S. shipment of new tanks to South Korea, the North Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* also published an article criticizing the move on December 10.

    朝鲜谴责美向南朝鲜运进新型坦克
    新华社平壤12月13日电  朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会书记局12日发表新闻公报，强烈谴责美国最近把新型坦克运进南朝鲜。
    据合众国际社报道，美国最近向南朝鲜运进了一批M—1A新型坦克。这些计划提供给美国驻南朝鲜陆军第二步兵师的新型坦克，具有很高的机动能力，可以迅速转移到任何必要的地区。
    朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会书记局的新闻公报说，朝鲜方面为朝鲜半岛消除战争和巩固和平，曾提出了举行由朝鲜南北方和美国参加的三方会谈的建议，并主动单方面地裁军10万名和动员15万名军人参加经济建设。但是，美国不仅没有接受北方的和平建议，反而不断地鼓吹南北对峙，给南北方对话造成困难。这一次又在驻防在军事分界线附近的美军部队部署高性能坦克，是对希望国家和平与和平统一的朝鲜人民的挑战。公报对此表示强烈的抗议，并要求美国立即停止在南朝鲜增强武力的活动。
    就美国向南朝鲜运进新式坦克一事，朝鲜《劳动新闻》10日也曾发表文章进行指责。
