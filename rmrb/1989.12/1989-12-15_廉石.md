In ancient times, some literati, poets, fishermen, and woodcutters loved stones as if their lives depended on them, and were so fond of stones that they called them "brother" or "friend." These stories have been passed down through the ages on the literary scene.

While sailing through the sea of history, the author discovered a type of stone that people cherish and love deeply— the Stone of Integrity. The Stone of Integrity, originally named Yulin Stone, got its name because Lu Ji served as the governor of Yulin. Lu Ji was known for his clean governance and had no personal wealth. When he was transferred from Yulin, his boat was too light to cross the sea, so he took a large stone from the shore to weigh it down. This stone, used to weigh down the empty boat, was preserved by the locals, who carved the words "Stone of Integrity" on it. Later, this "Stone of Integrity" was placed in the county school of Suzhou for people to visit and admire.

Two hundred years later, during the Southern Dynasties, Jiang Ke served as the magistrate of Kuaiji County. He was known for his clean and upright governance, and the people lived in peace while the officials were in awe. When Jiang Ke was transferred, he also took a boat back, and the boat was empty and swayed on the water. Jiang Ke then took ten or more stones from the Xiling shore to weigh down the boat, continuing the tale of the "Stone of Integrity."

"People on the road are like monuments." In history, those who have done good deeds for the nation and the people will have a monument erected in their hearts by the people. The stories of "Jujin Pavilion," "One-Fen Pavilion," "Four-Knowledge Terrace," "Integrity Stream," "Integrity Spring," and the "Stone of Integrity" all reflect the people's praise for the upright and honest.

    廉石
    古代有些文士诗翁、钓徒樵子，爱石如命、嗜石成癖，直呼石为“兄”为“友”，在文坛上传为千古佳话。
    笔者在史海泛舟中发现一种被人们寄予希望和厚爱的一种石——廉石。廉石，本名郁林石，因陆绩当郁林太守而得名。陆绩为政清廉，无有积蓄，当调离郁林时，因归舟太轻难以渡海，于岸上取巨石压之。这压空船的石头被百姓保存下来，有人在其上镌刻“廉石”二字。后来这块“廉石”置于苏州的郡学内，供人瞻仰参观。
    二百年后，南朝的江革任会稽郡丞，居官清明廉正，人安吏畏。在江革奉调离任时，也是乘船而归，船上空空荡荡，在水面摇摆不定，江革就在西陵岸取石十余片用来压船，续写“廉石”佳篇。
    “路上行人口似碑”。在历史上，凡是对民族、对人民作过有益的事，都会在人民心中竖起一块碑。留传至今的“拒金亭”、“一文亭”、“四知台”、“廉溪”、“廉泉”，以及“廉石”的轶闻佳话，均寄寓着人民对廉洁者的褒扬。
