The Party's policy of enriching the people has brought about significant changes in the lives of farmers in Jiepaizhen, our city. The per capita income has risen from over 200 yuan 10 years ago to over 1100 yuan. Nearly 70% of the households have moved into apartment buildings. In recent years, due to the weakening of ideological and political education in rural areas, gambling, superstition, and neighbor disputes have increased, leading to more lawless incidents and strained relations between officials and the people. These phenomena have caused widespread concern.

A farmer wrote a letter to the town Party Committee secretary, asking why, despite the farmers' increased wealth, social problems have become more severe. When this letter was read at the Party Committee meeting, it sparked a strong reaction from the town Party Committee. Thus, the town's leading officials personally conducted investigations and research in the villages and, starting in August this year, gradually launched the "Civilized New Wind Household" campaign across the town. They established 10 evaluation criteria, including donating patriotic grain, adhering to family planning, abstaining from gambling and superstition, avoiding extravagant weddings and funerals, respecting social ethics, and voluntarily abiding by the law.

Bashan Village, which was rated as a civilized unit by Zhenjiang City, had 360 households voluntarily evaluate themselves against the 10 criteria, resulting in 110 households being named "Civilized New Wind Households." However, out of the 5 members of the village Party branch committee, only 1 was rated, and out of the 28 Party members, only 5 had family members rated. Those village cadres and Party members who were not rated made sincere self-criticisms at the meeting. Since then, the village Party branch committee members have taken the lead in banning gambling, participating in voluntary labor, and repairing roads voluntarily. The masses say that now, Party members and cadres talk less and do more.

The "Civilized New Wind Household" campaign has driven the masses to educate and manage themselves. In the past, whenever a household in the village had a wedding or funeral, it was customary to invite guests and give gifts. Now, the 5 village committees in Bashan Village have spontaneously organized wedding and funeral affairs committees to simplify such events. Zhu Yonghe, a couple from Heimuqiao Village who are successful in their business, were not rated as "Civilized New Wind Households" due to their involvement in gambling. Now, they voluntarily participate in the village's anti-gambling meetings, not only refraining from gambling but also working harder to become wealthy. Since the launch of the "Civilized New Wind Household" campaign, there have been no serious lawless incidents in this town, and the rates of civil disputes and public security cases have decreased by 50%. The rampant gambling trend has also been effectively curbed.

The "Civilized New Wind Household" campaign has brought good results to the ideological education work in the rural areas of Jiepaizhen. Problems such as over-planned births, grain collection, illegal construction, and neighbor disputes, which have long plagued village cadres, have been resolved. This year, 3 households in Heimuqiao Village had reduced rice yields and could not complete their grain collection and procurement tasks. More than 10 "Civilized New Wind Households" in the village helped them fulfill their grain collection tasks.

    界牌镇的文明新风户
    党的富民政策，使我市界牌镇农民的生活发生巨大变化，人均收入由10年前的200多元上升到1100多元。有近70％的农户住上了楼房。近几年来，由于农村思想政治教育被淡化，致使农村赌博、封建迷信活动抬头，邻里纠纷四起，违法乱纪案件增多，干群关系紧张。这些现象引起了人们的普遍忧虑。
    一位农民写信给镇党委书记，问为什么现在农民富裕了，而社会问题却越来越严重？当这封信在党委会宣读时，引起了镇党委的强烈反响。于是，镇主要领导同志亲自深入乡村调查研究，并于今年8月在全镇范围内逐步开展了争创“文明新风户”活动。制订了交爱国粮、无超计划生育、无赌博迷信行为、不大操大办红白喜事、尊重社会公德、自觉尊纪守法等10项评比标准。
    曾被镇江市评为文明单位的芭山村，360户家庭自觉对照10项标准，共评出110户“文明新风户”，但村党支部5名支委中只有1名评上，28名党员中只有5名党员家属被评上。没评上的村干部和党员在会上认真作了检讨。这以后，村党支部一班人带头禁赌，参加义务劳动，义务修路。群众说，现在党员干部说空话的少了，办实事的又多了。
    文明新风户活动带动了群众进行自我教育，自我管理。过去村上谁家有红白喜事，请客送礼成风，现在芭山村5个村民小组自发组织红白喜事理事会，办婚丧事从简。黑木桥村民朱永和夫妇是致富能手，但由于参加赌博，没被评上“文明新风户”，如今他俩自觉参加村上的禁赌会，不但不参与赌博，而且劳动致富更勤奋。这个镇自开展文明新风户活动以来，没有发生一起严重违法乱纪案件，民事纠纷、治安案件率下降了50％，盛行的赌博风也基本刹住。
    文明新风户活动给界牌镇农村思想教育工作带来了很好的效果。令村干部头痛的超计划生育、催交公粮、违章建房、邻里纠纷案问题得到了解决。黑木桥村今年有3户农民水稻减产，无法交清公粮订购任务，村上10多户文明新风户帮助他们完成缴粮任务。
