At the foot of Miaofeng Mountain in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing, a modern factory stands amidst lush greenery. This is the Beijing Haidian Boiler Factory, a national model for the development of collective economy.

The tall factory buildings and modern equipment are impressive; the high-quality products and leading economic benefits in the industry are even more remarkable. This enterprise with just 200 people started with only 2,000 yuan and, in ten years, has achieved remarkable results: the labor productivity per person is 84,000 yuan, and the profit per person is 150,000 yuan, both leading the nation in the same industry. In ten years, the factory has not received a single yuan of state investment but has contributed over 80 million yuan in taxes to the state.

Why has the Haidian Boiler Factory achieved such remarkable development? Factory Director Jiang Yufu says that the achievements are the result of the hard work, sweat, and dedication of all the employees. It has been a journey of arduous struggle.

“A pawn crosses the river, only advancing, never retreating!”

In June 1978, in a narrow alley in Haidian Town, Beijing, a water and heating installation team was established by the Shallow Lake Residents' Committee to provide jobs for a few unemployed youth. A few wrenches, several hammers, an old welding machine, and a homemade three-wheeled cart were their only tools. Initially, they made chimneys, stove hooks, and iron pots and pans to sell at the market. Because their prices were lower, some units gave them small jobs. They worked quickly and well, and gradually, their business increased. They used the earnings to buy more equipment and expand production, like a snowball rolling downhill.

By 1980, the Haidian Boiler Factory was officially established.

In 1984, the factory applied the concept and methods of systems engineering to the entire boiler production process, implementing strict quality management from the director to the workers, each with their own responsibilities. They understood that if a company neglects product quality, no matter what sales tactics it uses, it will ultimately face a short life. Despite the busy production schedule, they did not neglect employee training, using part-time and semi-official methods to train employees, with 95% passing the Beijing City Comprehensive Quality Management Association's exams.

Boilers are long-lasting, high-priced items. When purchasing, users consider not only the product's quality and performance but also whether faults can be promptly resolved and whether spare parts can be supplied in a timely manner. How well these issues are addressed directly affects the user's attitude towards the product.

The Haidian Boiler Factory, with a spirit of responsibility and service to the users, has established quality files for each user, tracking the quality and performance of the products and user feedback. Every heating season, Director Jiang Yufu organizes user visit teams to travel across the country to visit users and actively resolve issues. A unit in Hohhot bought a boiler from the factory, which was damaged during transportation, causing the furnace wall to be damaged. Although it was not the factory's responsibility, upon learning of the issue, they immediately sent people with equipment to the site to fix it for free.

To ensure user satisfaction, over the years, they have traveled countless miles. The hard work has borne fruit: so far, the products sold by the Haidian Boiler Factory to more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have had no quality accidents, with a 100% product qualification rate for 10 consecutive years. Users generally reflect that using products from the Haidian Boiler Factory gives them peace of mind.

    “小卒”过河
    ——北京海淀锅炉厂艰苦创业纪实
    刘明
    北京西北郊妙峰山下，一座现代化的厂房矗立于绿树掩映之中。这就是全国发展集体经济的先进单位——北京海淀锅炉厂。
    高大的厂房和现代化的设备，令人赞不绝口；优质产品和在全国同行业中领先的经济效益，更令人瞩目。这个仅有200人的企业，靠2000元起家，十年之间创造出令人欣喜的业绩：全员劳动生产率达8.4万元，人均创利1.5万元，均居全国同行业之首；建厂十年没要国家一分投资，却向国家上缴利税8000多万元。
    海淀锅炉厂为什么能有如此显著的发展？厂长姜玉福说，成绩是靠全厂职工用双手去创造，用汗水去积累，用奉献去换取的，经过了艰苦的拚搏。
  “小卒”过河，只进不退！
    1978年6月，在北京海淀镇一条狭窄的胡同里，由浅水湖居委会组建了一个水暖安装队，目的是安置几个待业青年。几柄扳子、数把锤子、一台旧电焊机和一台土建的三轮车是他们的全部生产工具。开始，做些烟筒、炉钩炉铲和铁盆铁簸箕拿到集贸市场去卖。因为收费比别人便宜，一些单位将一批小活交给他们，他们干得快，干得好，生意渐渐多起来。挣了钱，他们添置设备扩大再生产，滚雪球似的。
    到1980年，海淀锅炉厂正式建立。
    1984年，该厂运用系统工程的概念与方法，对锅炉生产的全过程实行严格的质量管理，从厂长到工人，都有自己的包保责任。他们懂得，一个企业，如果忽视产品质量，不管采用什么样的销售手段，最终都逃不掉短命的下场。尽管生产任务十分繁忙，他们却没有放松职工培训，采用业余、半脱产等方式对职工进行培训，使95％的职工通过了北京市全面质量管理协会的考试。
    锅炉是使用寿命长、价格较高的商品，用户在购买时除考虑产品的质量、性能，还要考虑有了故障能否及时排除，修理用的配件能否及时补充。这些问题解决得好坏直接影响到用户对商品本身的态度。
    海淀锅炉厂本着对用户负责为用户服务的精神，给每个用户都建立了质量档案，对产品质量、性能及用户的意见要求情况进行跟踪调查。每年一到采暖季节，厂长姜玉福都组织用户回访组，到全国各地走访用户，积极为用户排除故障。呼和浩特的一个单位买了这个厂的锅炉，在运输中出了差，造成炉壁损坏，本不属锅炉厂责任，但他们得知后，连夜派人带上设备赶往现场免费修好。
    为了让用户踏实，十年来，不知他们为此走了多少路。艰苦的工作结出丰硕的成果，到目前为止，海淀锅炉厂销往全国20多个省、市、自治区的产品，没有一台发生质量事故，已连续10年产品合格率达100％，用户普遍反映，使用海淀锅炉厂的产品心里踏实。
