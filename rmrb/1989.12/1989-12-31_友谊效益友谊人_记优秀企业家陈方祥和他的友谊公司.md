**The Benefits of Friendship and the People of Friendship – A Record of Outstanding Entrepreneur Chen Fangxiang and His Friendship Company**

**By People's Daily Reporters Zheng De Gang and Xinhua News Agency Reporter Su Hui Zhi**

Chen Fangxiang is in his early 40s, with a naturally stubborn temperament. In the 1960s, when the famous labor model Xue Guirong from Daqing became renowned for "revolutionizing with five iron shovels," Chen Fangxiang was still a young boy full of childishness. Now, however, people compare him to Xue Guirong, who is a whole generation older, and call his reforms the "second revolution" for the families of Daqing. Chen Fangxiang himself could not have imagined that when he first stood up to bravely reform the old production model in the agricultural and sideline production sector of national petroleum enterprises, it would have such a significant impact on his future life.

	"This guy has a lot of drive; he's never lost a battle." An old worker evaluated Chen Fangxiang like this. Those who know Chen Fangxiang understand that when he works, he has a tenacious spirit, and because of this, others respect him. At the age of 26, he became the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Second Mine of the First Oil Extraction Plant in Daqing.

	Just as Chen Fangxiang was ready to spread his wings, fate played a trick on him. In 1984, this vigorous man, who had always been active on the front lines of oil extraction, was surprisingly "demoted" to the second line and became the head of 800-plus family members of the workers—the director and Party branch secretary of the Friendship Management Station of the First Oil Extraction Plant in Daqing. This was a "women's brigade" mainly engaged in agricultural and sideline production, and Chen Fangxiang became a genuine "Party representative." Of course, Chen Fangxiang would not say anything about the organization's appointment, but what he faced was indeed a humiliating scene: 800-plus family members, with an average education level of only third grade in primary school, and 96% were women; a dilapidated office that could not be more simple, a few broken farming tools that were about to fall apart, and an account book with a deficit of 7.6 million yuan. Moreover, the 1,800 mu of farmland that the station relied on for survival was exactly in this year taken over by 1,200 mu by new oil wells.

	Seeing this situation, everyone's hearts were shrouded in a layer of gloom. Chen Fangxiang was even more breathless. What to do? The eyes of 800-plus people were fixed on Chen Fangxiang, but his eyes were fixed on this barren land under his feet. It seemed that he had to grit his teeth and forge ahead, since he had already boarded the "pirate ship," he might as well go all out. Chen Fangxiang gritted his teeth.

	(2)

	For a whole 7 days and 7 nights, Chen Fangxiang stayed indoors. Based on the actual situation of the station, he referenced the "experience" he brought back from his trips outside, and wrote day and night, drawing a 13-chapter, 31-article, 134-clause reform blueprint.

	"Reform, and pave a path of self-accumulation, self-transformation, self-development, and self-improvement!" Chen Fangxiang started with the most troublesome personnel system, and the first to be "operated on" was himself. He first removed his own director's iron chair and posted a notice to compete for the newly established general manager of the Friendship Industrial Company, stating, "Whoever has the ability can compete, and whoever is elected can form the cabinet!" This was the first of its kind in Daqing and even in the national petroleum system. Those who advised, scolded, and supported all came. The 800-plus worker family members placed their hopes on him, and in the end, Chen Fangxiang was elected general manager with a unanimous vote. After signing a three-year contract with the higher authorities, Chen Fangxiang publicly declared: If the "Friendship" does not change in three years, he would be demoted three levels and dismissed on the spot! Thus, Chen Fangxiang began the arduous journey of steering the Friendship Company ship.

	Reform is one thing, but actually doing it is another. Chen Fangxiang's stubbornness came out, and he said do it and did it: First, he announced the implementation of full-floating wages, risk wages, responsibility wages, mortgage guarantee, and a combination of reward systems for over-fulfillment and under-fulfillment, instantly shattering the iron rice bowls of all employees, including his own. For Daqing workers and their families who were used to receiving state wages and oil field subsidies, this was simply an 8.0-magnitude earthquake! Someone panicked: "Chen Fangxiang, you've shattered my rice bowl, and if I don't get money at the end of the year, I'll smash your pot!" Someone spoke coldly: "We in Daqing have surpassed the nation, and Chen Fangxiang wants to stand alone!"

	Chen Fangxiang just smiled it off. He didn't have time to pay attention to these things, and what he was more concerned about was the talent problem in the enterprise. The competition of enterprises is the competition of talents. But the Friendship Company had an average education level of only third grade in primary school, what professional talents? To solve this problem, Chen Fangxiang spared no expense, adopting on-the-job training and sending people out for training to cultivate talents. He himself also squeezed time to attend night school and correspondence courses. In three years, he obtained two college diplomas and later became an economist and enterprise management consultant. Now, the company has more than 80 professionals of various kinds.

	Chen Fangxiang's approach to using people does not just look at diplomas but also values achievements. He said: "My reform is to treat laziness, not age. Talents are not just in the files, but also in practice." He appointed a person without a diploma but who understood management to manage the horse-drawn carriage team. Without spending a single cent of the state's money, relying on five horse-drawn carriages, he made 10 million yuan for "Friendship" in a few years. An elderly and weak old worker had a fiery temper and was not wanted during the contract. Chen Fangxiang, however, saw his serious and impartial side in handling matters and arranged for him to be a supervisor. As a result, this old worker did an excellent job. When the company built a micro-car repair center, Chen Fangxiang went to great lengths, visiting nine times, and finally "poached" a famous technician in Daqing. This repair center, which was not large in scale, made more than 100 million yuan for the state in a few years, was rated as an advanced unit for three consecutive years, and was designated as a provincial-level repair and maintenance unit. Chen Fangxiang also established the "Sunday Engineer Association," with nearly 100 units and several hundred professional talents joining his ranks, including dozens of senior engineers and associate professors, forming a powerful think tank. The water purification agent factory of the company was established by adopting the suggestions of experts. It started production in half a year and paid 150,000 yuan in taxes to the state. Currently, this small factory with only 13 people is responsible for the production of surface wastewater purification agents for the entire Daqing oil field, with an annual output value of 20 million yuan and an annual profit of 400,000 yuan in taxes.

	At the beginning of the reform, Chen Fangxiang had only a dozen million yuan in fixed assets and a pile of debts, with no funds at all. He did not ask the state for a single cent of investment, nor did he borrow a single cent from the bank. Instead, he led the worker family members to work hard from dawn to dusk, doing whatever dirty, tiring work that no one wanted to do but paid well, such as well sites, burning lime, loading stones, etc. In three months, they hard-earned 3 million yuan. With this bit of blood money, relying on a tenacious spirit, Chen Fangxiang contracted for only 146 days, and the company's annual output value increased by 86% compared to the best historical level before the reform, with profits doubling and per capita income doubling. Everyone's income was realized according to the contract, but only Chen Fangxiang's own was not realized, and he only took the wage of a general cadre at the grassroots level.

	The family's foundation gradually became stronger, and Chen Fangxiang became invigorated. Backed by the oil field, he went to the northwest and south of the Yangtze River, cooperating and jointly establishing seven joint-venture factories and economic cooperation bodies with more than a dozen factories and research institutes in eight provinces and cities across the country, such as plastic factories and adhesive technology service companies. To collect information, he also uniquely rented a 700-square-meter space at the Daqing Railway Station, installed direct-dial telephones to all parts of the country, established four business departments for economic intelligence, trade, etc., and carried out six services, doing business while exploring news.

	Chen Fangxiang became prosperous, and some people's eyes turned red. An anonymous letter reported him to the higher-level disciplinary inspection department, and all the hats that could be used were put on his head. To be responsible for Chen Fangxiang himself and all the employees, the disciplinary inspection team entered the company and carefully checked tens of thousands of accounts over three months. During these three months, Chen Fangxiang buried his grievances in his heart, leading the employees to work hard for 90 days and establishing three factories and a car parts store. On the day the factory was completed, it was also the day the disciplinary inspection team announced his innocence. "Meritorious in entrepreneurship, guiltless in reform!" The higher-level party organization gave him this conclusion. Some members of the disciplinary inspection team even expressed their desire to stay in the company to work with Chen Fangxiang. Chen Fangxiang shed tears, saying, "The greatest care is the trust of the party organization and the support of comrades." Someone suggested punishing the person who made the false report. Chen Fangxiang just smiled and said, "I thank the person who wrote the letter. He is equivalent to spending money to advertise for me and also ringing an alarm bell for me."

	In September 1987, at the national petroleum enterprise deepening reform symposium, the former minister of the Petroleum Industry, Wang Tao, praised him as an "outstanding entrepreneur of the Daqing oil field collective enterprise" after listening to Chen Fangxiang's report. This is a fitting evaluation of Chen Fangxiang. In the few years of reform, Chen Fangxiang has been continuously rated as a model laborer in Daqing City and was rated as an outstanding young entrepreneur in the Northeast in 1988. His reform achievements were included in "Biographies of Outstanding Chinese Entrepreneurs," "Biographies of Outstanding Entrepreneurs in Heilongjiang Province," and "Biographies of Outstanding Entrepreneurs in Daqing City." The Central Television Station also broadcasted his special program "The Business of the Brave."

	In the span of five years, Chen Fangxiang and his partners shed several layers of skin, truly starting from scratch, establishing 21 economic entities, developing from a single agricultural and sideline production to today's comprehensive industries such as breeding, chemical repair, mechanical processing, transportation, commerce, catering services, etc., with an annual output value increasing from the highest level of more than 700,000 yuan before the reform to 10 million yuan. The labor productivity of the entire staff has increased by 12 times. Now, the value created by a "Friendship" person in a year is the total of 15 people in 1983; the taxes paid in a year are 335 times that of 1983! More than 800 worker family members ended the history of living on "handouts," and in five years, they not only did not ask the state for a single cent, but also paid more than 100 million yuan to the state; the company's fixed assets also increased from the dozen million yuan at the time of its establishment to 60 million yuan.

	From nothing to a hundred million "assets," all in just five years. People call this the "Friendship Effect."

	Today's Friendship Company is already in full bloom, but Chen Fangxiang's goal is not just this. Someone asked him, "Which of the factories you have established are you most satisfied with?" Chen Fangxiang said ambitiously, "The next one!"

    友谊效益友谊人
    ——记优秀企业家陈方祥和他的友谊公司
    本报记者　郑德刚　新华社记者　苏会志
    陈方祥40出头，天生的倔脾气。在60年代，大庆著名劳模薛桂芳以“五把铁锹闹革命”而名扬天下时，陈方祥还是个稚气十足的毛头小子。而现在居然有人把他同整整大他一辈的薛桂芳相提并论，称他的改革是大庆家属的“第二次革命”。陈方祥自己也料想不到，当他在全国石油企业的农副战线上第一个起来对旧的生产模式进行勇敢的改革之时，会给他今后的生活带来如此之大的影响。
    （一）
    “这小子有股冲劲儿，从没败过阵。”一位老工人这样评价陈方祥。了解陈方祥的人都知道，他干起活来有一股子“拚”劲儿，就凭这，别人服气。他26岁就当了大庆采油一厂二矿的党委副书记。
    正当陈方祥准备一展宏图之时，命运却开起了他的玩笑。1984年，这位一直活跃在采油第一线年富力强的汉子居然“退居二线”，当了800多名职工家属的头儿——大庆采油一厂友谊管理站站长兼党总支书记。这是一支以农副业为主的“娘子军”，陈方祥成了名副其实的“党代表”。对组织上的这项任命，陈方祥当然不会说什么，但他所面临的，的确是一幅令人难堪的画面：800多名家属，平均文化程度只有小学三年级，“老娘们”占96％；一座不能再简陋的办公室，几件快散架的破农具，一本写着76万元“赤字”的帐薄。不仅如此，站上赖以生存的1800亩农田也恰在这一年让新油井占去了1200亩。
    看到这份家当，全体职工心头都蒙上了一层愁云。陈方祥更是被压得喘不过气来。怎么办？800多双眼盯着陈方祥，而他的眼睛却盯着脚下这片贫瘠的土地。看来，只有硬着头皮闯了，既然上了“贼船”，那就一切豁出去了。陈方祥咬咬牙。
    （二）
    整整7天7夜，陈方祥闭门不出。他根据本站的实际情况，参考外出取回来的“经”，昼夜奋笔疾书，绘出一份13章31款134条的改革蓝图。
    “要改革，要闯出一条自我积累、自我改造、自我发展、自我完善之路！”陈方祥从最让人头痛的人事制度下手了，而第一个被“开刀”的恰恰就是他自己。他首先搬掉了自己站长的铁交椅，并贴出了一份竞选新成立的友谊实业总公司总经理的公告，称“谁有能力谁来竞争，谁被选上谁来组阁！”这在大庆以至全国石油系统都是第一份。劝的、骂的、支持的都来了。800多名职工家属寄希望于他，最后陈方祥以满票当选为总经理。同上级签完三年承包合同后，陈方祥当众宣称：三年不改变“友谊”面貌，降他三级工资，就地免职！就这样，陈方祥驾驶着友谊公司这条船开始了艰难的航程。
    改革，嘴上说说和实打实地真干是两回事。陈方祥倔劲儿上来，说干就干：先宣布实行工资全额浮动，实行风险工资、责任工资、抵押保包和包超结合的奖励制度，一下子就砸了所有职工包括他自己的铁饭碗。这对拿惯了国家工资和油田补贴的大庆职工和家属来说，简直是八级地震！有人急了：“陈方祥，你砸了我的饭碗，年底我分不到钱，我就砸了你家的锅！”有人冷言冷语：“咱们大庆超全国了，陈方祥要独树一帜呢！”
    对此，陈方祥一笑了之。他没时间顾及这些，更关注的是企业的人才问题。企业的竞争就是人才的竞争。可友谊公司平均只有小学三年级的文化程度，谈什么专业人才？为解决这个问题，陈方祥不惜重金，采取就地培训和送出去代培的方法培养人才。他自己也挤时间上夜校、读函大。三年时间，他获得了两个大专毕业证书，后来还当了经济师和企业管理咨询师。现在，全公司已有各类专业人员80多人。
    陈方祥用人之道，不仅看文凭，更重实绩。他说：“我的改革是治懒不治老，人才不都在档案里，更在实践中。”他起用一位没文凭但懂管理的人管马车队，没要国家一分钱，靠5辆牛马车，几年就为“友谊”挣了100万元。一位年老体弱的老工人脾气火爆，承包时没人要。陈方祥却看中了他办事认真、不讲情面的一面，安排他当了监督员。结果这位老工人干得很出色。公司新建了微型汽车维修中心，陈方祥多方奔走，九顾茅庐，硬是把一位在大庆有名的技师“挖”来。这个规模不大的维修中心几年为国家创利上百万元，连续三年被评为先进单位，还被指定为省一级修保单位。陈方祥还成立了“星期日工程师联谊会”，先后有近百个单位的几百名专业人才加入了他的阵营，其中有高级工程师和副教授几十人，形成了一个强有力的智囊团。公司的净水剂厂就是采纳了专家们的建议而建立的。投产半年就向国家上交利税15万多元。目前，这家只有13个人的小厂担负着全大庆油田地面污水净化剂的生产任务，年产值达200万元，一年可创利税40万元。
    （三）
    改革之初，陈方祥除了十几万元的固定资产和一屁股外债，资金分文皆无。他没要国家一分投资，没向银行贷一分钱款，而是带领职工家属们起早贪黑干苦力搞积累，什么活脏累没人愿干而挣钱多，他们就干什么，垫井场、烧石灰、装石头等等。三个月，硬是用血汗换来了30万元资金。就凭这点血汗钱，靠一股冲劲儿，陈方祥承包仅146天，全公司年产值就比改革前历史最好水平增长了86％，利润翻两番，人均收入翻一番。人人的收入都按合同兑现了，唯独陈方祥自己的没兑现，他只拿了基层一般干部的工资。
    家底渐渐厚了起来，陈方祥如虎添翼。背靠油田这块宝地，他上西北，下江南，先后与全国8个省、市的十几家工厂和科研部门协作联合，办起了塑料厂、粘接技术服务公司等7个联营厂，发展了十几个经济联合体。为了搜集信息，他还别出心裁地在大庆市火车站租了一块700平方米的地方，安上了直拨全国各地的电话，设立了经济情报、贸易等四个业务部门，还开展6项服务，边做生意，边探消息。
    （四）
    陈方祥红火了，有的人眼睛也红了。一封匿名信把他告到上级纪检部门，能用的帽子全扣在他的头上。为了对陈方祥本人和全体职工负责，纪检组开进了公司，三个月仔仔细细查了上万笔帐。这三个月，陈方祥把委屈深埋心里，带领职工狠狠干了90天，办起了三个工厂和一个汽车配件商店。三个月后，陈方祥体重掉了3公斤。工厂落成之日，正是纪检组宣布他清白如水之时。“创业有功，改革无罪！”上级党组织给他下了结论。有的纪检组成员干脆表示，要留在公司里跟陈方祥一块儿干。陈方祥流泪了，他说：“最大的关怀莫过于党组织的信任和同志们的支持。”有人提出要治治那位乱告状的人。陈方祥一笑说：“我感谢那位写信人，他等于花钱为我作了广告，又给我敲了警钟。”
    1987年9月，在全国石油企业深化改革座谈会上，石油部的老部长王涛听了陈方祥的汇报后，称赞他是“大庆油田集体企业的优秀企业家”。这是对陈方祥恰如其分的评价。改革几年来，陈方祥连续几年被评为大庆市劳模标兵，1988年又被评为东三省优秀青年企业家。他的改革事迹写入了《中国优秀企事业家列传》、《黑龙江省优秀企业家列传》和《大庆市优秀企业家列传》，中央电视台还播放了他的专题片《勇敢者的事业》。
    整整五年的时间，陈方祥和他的伙伴们掉了几层皮，真正是白手起家，办起21个经济实体，从单一的农副业生产，发展到今天的养殖、化工修理、机械加工、运输、商业、饮食服务等综合性实业，年产值由改革前最高水平的70多万元增长到1000万元，全员劳动生产率提高了12倍。如今一个“友谊”人一年创造的价值，是1983年15个人的总和；一年上交的利税，是1983年的335倍！800多职工家属结束了靠“嗟来之食”过活的历史，五年不但没要国家一分钱，还向国家上交了100多万元；全公司的固定资产也由创业时的十几万元增到600万元。
    从一无所有，到百万“家私”，仅仅用五年时间，对此，人们称之为“友谊效益”。
    今日的友谊公司，早已花红叶绿、果实累累，但陈方祥的目标还不止这些。有人问他：“你认为你创办的这些工厂哪一个最满意？”陈方祥“野心勃勃”地说：“下一个！”
