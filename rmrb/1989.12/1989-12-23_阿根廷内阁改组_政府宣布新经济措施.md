Yesterday, Argentina's new ministers of Economy, Interior, and Social Welfare were sworn in. This is the first cabinet reshuffle since President Menem took office in July. At the swearing-in ceremony, the new Minister of Economy, Gonzalez, announced the government's new economic measures, deciding to fully liberalize prices, implement a single floating exchange rate, and remove all restrictions on foreign exchange transactions.

In the past two weeks, due to poor inflation expectations, the market has reacted strongly, with the black market dollar soaring and the gap between the black market and official dollar prices reaching 60%. The rise in the dollar has driven up prices, with the monthly inflation rate for the first week of December already at 23%. To stabilize the market, the government announced a 54% devaluation of the Argentine peso (aligning it with the black market price), increased export retention, deferred public debt repayment by two years, and raised public utility fees by 40%. This adjustment changed the government's promise that various economic parameters would remain unchanged until 1991, damaging government credibility. As a result, the adjustment did not achieve the goal of calming market volatility but instead caused a greater storm. The black market dollar exchange rate continued to rise, banks faced a run, and commercial activities were nearly paralyzed. The government had to order banks to close. Minister of Economy Labaneiri resigned.

After the announcement of the new economic measures, most private enterprises expressed support, but some economists within the government believe that the new measures carry significant risks.

    阿根廷内阁改组
    政府宣布新经济措施
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯12月19日电　记者李志明报道：昨天阿根廷新任经济部长、内政部长和社会福利部长宣誓就职。这是梅内姆总统7月就职以来第一次改组内阁。新任经济部长贡萨雷斯在就职仪式上宣布了政府的新经济措施，决定物价全部放开，实行单一浮动汇率，取消所有对外汇买卖的限制。
    最近两周，由于通货膨胀预期不佳，市场反应强烈，美元黑市暴涨，与官价美元差距达60％。美元上升带动物价上扬，12月第一周计算月通膨率已达23％。为了稳定市场，一周前政府宣布阿币贬值54％（与黑市价拉平），提高出口提留，公债还本延期2年，公用事业收费提高40％。这次调整改变了政府关于各项经济参数1991年前不变的承诺，政府信誉受损。结果调整没有达到平息市场动荡的目的，反而造成更大风暴。美元黑市比价继续上升，银行出现挤兑风潮，商业处于半瘫痪状态。政府不得不决定银行停业。经济部长拉巴内里提出辞职。
    新经济措施宣布之后，私人企业界大都表示支持，但政府内部的一些经济学家认为，新措施有极大的风险。
