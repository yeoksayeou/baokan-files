I have long harbored a desire to visit the ancient city of Yuanyang in Hunan, as depicted in Shen Congwen's "Border Town," particularly the famous scenic spot of Feng Huang Mountain.

A guide accompanied us from the city of Yuanyang to cross the Yuanshui River by motorized ferry. After traveling about a mile, we reached the foot of Feng Huang Mountain. The guide explained that there is a legend about this mountain! A fairy, enchanted by the beautiful scenery of the green mountains and clear waters along the Yuanshui River, forgot to return and transformed into the famous Feng Huang Mountain. Look, the mountain resembles a phoenix that has landed, and even the Yuanyang County Gazette describes this as the place where the phoenix alights.

From the tail end of Feng Huang Mountain, we climbed up an ancient stone path, a stone-paved road along the steep riverbank, and a newly constructed mountain road. We walked up the stone-paved road, surrounded by dense forests, quiet and cool. The scent of seasonal wildflowers and wintergreen blooms filled the air, and the birdsong along the way made the famous mountain even more serene and beautiful. After passing Feng Huang Pavilion, we reached the summit of Feng Huang Mountain, where the Feng Huang Temple stands. The temple was built during the Ming Dynasty and renovated during the Qing Dynasty. At that time, it had a heavenly gate, side halls, a main hall, and a Guanyin Pavilion, covering over 2,000 square meters. However, due to years of neglect, the heavenly gate has been destroyed, and the other buildings are no longer as they were.

The deity statues in the main hall still stand majestically, but in the side hall, there is a half-body statue of Zhang Xueliang.

It is said that Zhang Xueliang, the general who forced Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan, although he heard the roar of the nationwide resistance, lost his freedom to rush to the battlefield. He was secretly transferred and imprisoned in this ancient temple on Feng Huang Mountain, where he spent an entire year (November 1938 – December 1939). To this day, in the exhibition room of the side hall, there is still a poem by General Zhang titled "Self-Reflection of Regret": "In the vast blue sky, a lone shadow is distant, the journey of an old friend is long and winding. Youth gradually turns into white hair, only the spring breeze returns again."

Exiting the temple, looking down from the mountain peak, all that can be seen are towering yellow gentian trees, reaching into the clouds, surrounding the ancient temple, making Feng Huang Temple appear even more solemn and dignified. Following the right side of the temple gate, climbing up the rocky path, passing the turtle pond to the boat-viewing pavilion, and ascending the pavilion, one can look out in all directions. To the left, adjacent to Feng Huang Mountain, is Xiangluo Mountain. Between the two mountains, the Yuanyang Grand Bridge is being constructed, connecting the ancient city to the new city; to the right of Feng Huang Mountain, the Wuqianxi Hydroelectric Station is under construction. Once the station is completed, the ancient city of Yuanyang will be submerged in a vast highland lake. At that time, seagulls and mountain birds will gather in flocks, with white sails and waves shimmering, blending the sky and water into one. The unique scenery of mountains and seas will make Feng Huang Mountain even more beautiful!

    凤凰栖落的地方
    木一
    我早就有这个向往：到沈从文在《边城》里描绘过的那座湘西古城——沅陵的名胜之地凤凰山去。
    一位向导陪同我们从沅陵城关乘坐机帆渡船过了沅水，行约一里，便到了凤凰山山麓。向导介绍说，这凤凰山还有个传说呢！一位仙女因为迷恋这沅水夹岸青山秀水的美丽风光，乐而忘归，便变成了这著名的凤凰山。你看，这山就像一支落地的凤凰，连沅陵县志上也说这是凤凰栖落的地方。
    从凤凰山尾端攀援，有古老的背脊石砧路，有依陡峭河岸而延伸的石板路，还有新近几年修建的环山沙石公路。我们踏着石板路而上，遍山森林密布，幽静爽凉，满路的时令野花和冬青花卉喷发的青香扑鼻，沿途鸟语如歌，把名山烘托得更加幽静美妙。一过凤凰亭，便到了凤凰山巅的凤凰寺。寺为明代所建，清代重修过，当时有天门、厢房、大殿、观音阁共2000多平方米，后因年久失修，天门已毁，其他建筑也已非当年。
    大殿里的神像依然威严如仪，唯厢房中立有一尊学良半身塑像。
    据介绍，逼蒋抗日的张学良将军，虽然听到了全国抗日的隆隆炮声，却失去了奔赴疆场的自由，被蒋介石秘密辗转囚禁在凤凰山古寺内，在这里消磨了他整整一年的光阴（1938年11月——1939年12月）。至今在厢房的陈列室里，还留有张将军当年所作的《自感遗憾》诗：“万里碧空孤影远，故人行程路漫漫。少年渐渐鬓发老，惟有春风今又还。”
    出大庙，观山巅，全是粗壮的黄连树，高入云端，把古刹团团围住，使凤凰寺更加显得庄严肃穆。沿庙门右侧山岖攀登，经龟池至坐船亭，爬上亭台，举目四望，左边与凤凰山相邻的是香炉山。两山之坳，正在架设沅陵大桥，跨越古城接新城；凤凰山的右端，正在修建五强溪电站。电站建成后，沅陵古城将淹没在浩瀚的高山平湖之中。届时，沙鸥、山鸟成群，轮机白帆点点，波粼闪闪，水天一色。那一派山海相依的奇景将使凤凰山更添秀色！
