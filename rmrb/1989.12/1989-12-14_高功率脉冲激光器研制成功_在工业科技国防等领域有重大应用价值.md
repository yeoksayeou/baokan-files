    High-Power Pulse Laser Developed Successfully
    Has Significant Application Value in Industry, Science, and Defense

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 13 (Reporter Ma Kuijun) Professor Yao Jianquan of Tianjin University and his research team have recently developed a high-power pulse laser and a high-power thyristor switch-type solid-state laser power supply. Experts believe that this achievement is ahead of the international advanced level in the same field and has significant application value in industry, science, and defense.

    This high-power pulse laser leads in three main aspects compared to international advanced levels. First, it has high power. The actual measured output power reaches 528 watts, exceeding the current international level of 500 watts, thereby significantly expanding its application areas. Second, it has a high repetition frequency. The pulse repetition rate reaches 400 times per second, nearly doubling the current international level. The higher the repetition rate, the greater the laser's power. Third, the switch-type power supply single-path capacity reaches 15 kilowatts, far exceeding the current international level of 5 to 6 kilowatts. This indicator has increased the safe and stable continuous working time of the laser under high-temperature and high-load conditions from the current domestic level of 40 minutes to 15 hours, which is 10 hours more than the current international level of 5 hours. Experts believe that this means humanity has made a significant step forward in the field of laser science.

    Since its inception, the laser has been called the "miracle light." Its widespread applications in medicine, electronics, communications, photography, printing, and other fields have aroused widespread interest. The successful development of this high-power pulse YAG laser brings the miraculous functions of lasers into even more fields.

    高功率脉冲激光器研制成功
    在工业科技国防等领域有重大应用价值
    据新华社天津12月13日电  （记者马魁君）天津大学教授姚建铨和他的研究小组，最近研制成功高功率脉冲激光器及高功率可控硅开关型脉冲固体激光电源，专家们认为，这一成果领先于国际同一领域先进水平，在工业、科技、国防等领域都有重大应用价值。
    这台高功率脉冲激光器主要在3个方面领先于国际先进水平。一是功率高。实际测定输出功率达到528瓦，超过目前国际上500瓦的先进水平，这就使其应用领域大大扩展。二是重复频率高。脉冲重复次数达到每秒400次，比目前国际水平高出近1倍。重复次数越高，其激光威力也就越大。三是开关型电源单路容量达到15千瓦，大大高于目前国际上5至6千瓦的水平。这一指标把激光器在高温高负荷条件下的安全稳定连续工作时间，从目前国内的40分钟水平，一下子提高到15小时，比目前国际上的5小时高出10个小时。专家们认为，这意味着人类在激光科学领域又前进了一大步。
    激光，从它诞生那天起，就被人们称为“神奇之光”。它在医学、电子、通讯、摄影、印刷等方面的广泛应用，已引起人们的普遍兴趣。而这种高功率脉冲YAG激光器的研制成功，把激光的神奇功能带到了更多的领域之中。
