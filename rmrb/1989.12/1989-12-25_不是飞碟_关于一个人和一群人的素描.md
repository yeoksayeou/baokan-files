One day in 1986, the festive atmosphere of National Day still lingered in the city, like the red cotton trees that were in full bloom. A young man, around thirty-two or thirty-three years old, walked onto the station square with thousands of other travelers heading south.

Guangzhou, with its dazzling sunshine and vibrant colors, was like a vast sea, deep and mysterious. A mix of astonishment and excitement, confusion and hope filled the eyes of almost anyone who stepped into this city. He felt like a fish swimming in this sea.

Guangzhou also examined him. His cheap suit, with wrinkles on the sleeves and back like an eighty-year-old woman's face, made him look like a provincial man in Paris from Balzac's novels. He touched the 50 yuan in his pocket, a bitter smile flickering across his lips, then picked up his large red suitcase. He seemed to be thinking: "In a few days, he will comfortably enjoy a rich breakfast, skillfully tie a Gold Lion tie, and hand out a fragrant business card. Just another company among the countless ones in the city, another manager among the countless ones on the streets..."

He walked, his steps neither light nor heavy. He also felt like a fish, but not in a trivial sense. He had never felt the insignificance of life. The words of a great man were etched in his heart: "Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the earth!"

The waves called him, and the tides attracted him.

He was a fish ready to leap and fight;
He was a fish, his passion and a certain burning pain almost cooking him...

In 1984, the sky was clear, the pigeons cooed, and the chrysanthemums glowed like gold. Beijing welcomed 14 young reform enthusiasts from all over the country, invited by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

In the conference room on the fourth floor of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Department of Youth Cadres of the Organization Department, in the auditorium of the Central Directories, the auditorium of the Political Consultative Conference, in Peking University, Renmin University, and Beihang University, and finally in a quiet house near the North Gate of Zhongnanhai, people welcomed them with great enthusiasm and interest, listening to their speeches. Among them, his and his partners' achievements in advocating and developing intelligence were particularly noteworthy...

In August 1983, he resigned from his position as an editor of a well-known national university journal and became the head of a popular science magazine. Within a year, he and a few partners revived the dying magazine, started a youth popular science newspaper with a circulation of over 800,000, published a batch of valuable books, paid off old debts, and made over 300,000 yuan in profit. Then they established a "Youth Science Award Foundation" and started an economic management university with over 3,000 students... Just for this dazzling speed and achievement, he was named an outstanding Communist Party member of the provincial direct organs for that year.

He thought that China, which had missed many historical opportunities, had few left. Today, the new star of reform has risen on the horizon. How to grasp the handle of the constellation, how to use the light of the constellation, and how to write an epic under its illumination in this era, contemporary young people should hand in a resounding answer!

He emphasized: We must constantly develop ourselves, first of all, the development of intelligence. Today's sunrise industry is a knowledge-intensive industry, and today's society is a knowledge-intensive society. A small globe that seems to be peaceful and cooperative has already launched a smokeless war of intelligence. It can be said with certainty that the country with good intelligence development will definitely be rich and strong!

The wheels rolled deeply and clankingly across the vast North China Plain, heading south, south...

Listening to the sound of the train's progress, he thought, the train is like this era of reform and innovation, full of passion and ambition!

It's good that he got on this train, and his partners got on this train...

He had dealt with two vice-ministerial-level old cadres in Beijing.

One was Chen Bocun, who had worked in the Organization Department of the Central Committee during the Anti-Japanese War. In 1984, this elderly man in his seventies was the deputy leader of the Central Committee's work group to adjust the provincial committee. Chen Bocun invited him to his sickbed to understand the situation, listened with great interest, and chatted for 5 hours. When he left, Chen Bocun asked, "Young man, it's not easy for you to reform. Do you need this old man to help you with anything?"

The other was Wang Xingran, who was the deputy minister of the Ministry of Commerce in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic. In 1986, he was the leader of the inspection team sent by the State Council to the province. The old man understood his situation and finally said, "I see that you, young man, are cleaner the more you investigate, and more lovable the more you investigate. But in the future, you must be careful when doing things, and all the necessary procedures must be complete..."

In elementary school, even in the cold winter when the wind was like a knife, he never wore socks. He had many dreams of having a pair of socks, but he forgot them as soon as he woke up. In middle school, his home was over 100 li away from the county seat, so he naturally couldn't afford a train ticket. He had to walk home. He set off when the morning stars were few, and returned home when the Milky Way was slanted to the west. Under a small oil lamp, his mother pricked the blisters on his son's soles with a needle, and tears dropped like rain... But he had no tears. However, Chen Bocun's two sentences made his eyes moist, and Wang Xingran's words made his nose ache.

Within a year, the editorial department moved 5 times, causing 5 disturbances. After contacting dozens of experts and scholars from several colleges and universities and research institutes, they finally formed a writing team for 8 books. They wrote day and night for more than two months, but the publishing house that had originally promised to publish the books suddenly changed their mind. To give away 1 million copies of the newspaper to children before the June 1st Children's Day, the editorial department staff themselves divided the work, packed, and transported the newspapers. The large truck made 3 trips to the train station, but the other side changed the first-class package to a third-class package for transportation, and the cost also soared from a few hundred yuan to a few thousand yuan. This side was short of money, and that side was dark and rainy. The piles of newspapers, like a small mountain, would soon turn into a pile of pulp... It was really a journey full of difficulties!

He and his partners rubbed their feet, practiced their tongues, and thickened their faces, rushing around every day, bumping and knocking, so busy that they didn't even go to the hospital to see their one-year-old child who had intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and was in critical condition...

What was he after? A deputy division-level official's hat? He had thought deeply about the meaning of the word "leader." The implication of the Chinese character is too profound. "Leader" means the collar and sleeve, and the clothes are first dirty and first torn at these two places. Leaders should be the first to worry about the world and the last to enjoy it, let alone a small head of a unit! Was he after wealth? With clean wind and empty sleeves, bare walls at home, no color TV, no refrigerator, his office desk drawer was often filled with bags of instant noodles. He dared to pat his chest and say to the inspection team, "If you find any economic problems with me, sentence me to one year in prison. If you find any dirty money, sentence me to 10 years in prison..."

The famous man once disappeared.

People had various rumors: he had fallen from power, he had gone bankrupt. Some even said: he was in prison eating six liang of rice!

After Wang Xingran's pat, he began to look for a new breakthrough point. At this breakthrough point, the wisdom and energy he released would be maximized, proving that his decisive end to this year full of mixed feelings did not mean anything, but only meant the end of the prelude, and from there, he would move towards the main plot...

Not only because of his personality charm, there would always be young people with hot blood gathering around him.

Li Qiu Bo, a graduate of Wuhan University's Department of Economics, originally worked in the Foreign Economic Relations Commission of Guangdong Province. Cheng Guofu, a graduate of the Mechanical Manufacturing Department of Huazhong Agricultural University, originally worked in the Wuhan Instrument Factory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Pan Gongshe, a graduate of the Department of Chemistry at Fudan University, originally worked in the Shanghai Longfeng Factory. Qiu Ping, an actress from Zhujiang, starred in films such as "Zhenzhen's Hair Salon." One day, together with him and another person, the five of them imitated an advertisement from an Australian company and took a group photo. The advertisement was for an automatic dog feeder, and the picture showed five dogs looking sad and anxious because their owners were not at home. Below it was a line of text: Why are they sad?

For a period of time, the five of them were also in a sad and anxious situation. Although they rented a few empty rooms in a certain unit, there was only a three-legged broken sofa in the room. Qiu Ping moved a steel wire bed from her home, and the others could only sleep on the floor, using books as pillows or empty thermos bottles as pillows, sleeping for half a year. Because of the dampness and cold, Li Qiu Bo's legs rotted. Their pockets were also tight, and even when they cooked for themselves, they often worried about the next meal.

He and his partners were spiritually fulfilled, and they finally stood firm in Guangzhou, where the atmosphere of competition was the strongest.

He was not a son of a wealthy family and could not get documents or loans. He came from a farming family and believed in the truth of farmers: what you sow is what you reap. He advocated a commodity economy but despised the primitive desires that the initial stage of a commodity economy easily stirred up in people. He relied on his own brain, a brain that seemed to have 24 eyes.

These two dozen eyes coldly watched the rolling tide of almost everyone doing business in those two years. Many people thought that a commodity economy was just a big turnover of goods from morning to night, just a competition of raising and lowering prices in the smoke of wine and feasts, just a profit chasing like a hunting dog and somersaulting like a monkey... In fact, the most basic form of a commodity economy is commodity production, and the competition of commodities is ultimately a competition of science and technology, a competition of talents. Without a commodity economy backed by strong science and technology, although it once blew hot wind and rain, gathered clouds and shadows, it was ultimately a deformed fetus.

He found that in China, people used to say that Shanghai people were good at doing business, but now maybe Shanghai people should learn from Guangdong people. Guangdong is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, and the geographical location seems to determine that the bloodline has the factor of trade. Once the reform and opening up began, it often led the fashion of the world. That needle-like cleverness, that balloon-like courage, quickly showed a lively and clever vitality. But this vitality was limited. Due to the historical cultural origins that were not as good as the inland, and the wrong policies implemented for a long time after the founding of the country, Guangdong's science and technology could not be said to be developed, and high-quality talents were relatively lacking. The proportion of college students per ten thousand people in Guangdong was not much higher than that in Tibet...

Therefore, with the approval of the relevant state departments, he and his partners established a company in Guangzhou that belonged to the state-owned enterprise system, engaged in the development of high-tech and new products, and combined the irreplaceable vitality of the coastal areas with the intellectual advantages of the inland, taking a road of developing financial resources with intellectual resources, developing intellectual resources with financial resources, and serving economic construction.

The state did not give a single cent. It was another time of starting from scratch. A group of scholars who came from the inland one after another avoided their shortcomings and showed their strengths, avoided the heat of Guangdong, and sought the needs of Guangdong. In just two years, they made the company the strongest in the south. They explored a set of effective basic methods for technological development. The "General Port Management System," "Super Fast Dry Amino Baking Additive," "Emulsified Fuel Additive and Device," "Microcomputer Remote Multifunctional TV Telephone System," "Satellite Receiving Antenna," "Fish Preservation and Freshness Preservative," and a batch of new technologies have been applied or produced in Guangdong and coastal areas, with economic benefits in the hundreds of millions. The company not only established close and long-term cooperation with dozens of colleges and universities and more than ten research institutes and patent institutions across the country, having a lot of technical information sources; the company itself also formed a multi-disciplinary, multi-professional, and multi-functional intelligence complementary structure, with many people holding titles such as engineer, senior engineer, associate professor, and professor.

When he decided to strategically transfer again in August this year, ending the company, and entering Dinghu at the invitation of the People's Government of Dinghu District, Zengcheng City, Guangdong Province, to build the country's first private high-tech development zone - Science and Technology Industrial City, the business license of the Science and Technology City stated that its fixed assets were 100 million yuan.

Coming from the most difficult days, he often hummed a song: "No food, no clothes, the enemy will send them to us. No guns, no cannons, the enemy will make them for us..." In his mind, this "enemy" was not anything else, but the new technology that he was always seeking and worshipping.

He would no longer be short of money for a breakfast. The photo of the five people would become a warm and lasting memory on the journey of life. But he was still that provincial man who came to Paris, with a wrinkled and shiny collar like a barber's shaving cloth around his neck. When an idea came to him like raindrops, he often walked barefoot in the room, excited. The company stipulated, and in fact, it was also his self-stipulation, that the general manager's accommodation fee for business trips should not exceed 20 yuan per night. Now, in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, which have a bit of style, which hotel would welcome this 20 yuan with a smile? He had exceeded this standard countless times, and there were also expenses for entertaining clients, about 6,000 yuan in receipts, which he burned...

That big red suitcase, except for a few changes of clothes, was still empty.

Reform is not easy, but to reform with a pure motive is even harder.

Thousands of difficulties, but China will always have its own backbone.

Qiu Xinfu, originally a vice professor in the Department of Chemistry at Wuhan University. Nearly fifty years old, he left his family and children and stayed alone in Panyu, Guangdong for more than a year, from design to construction, production, and even personally tightening screws under the machine, turning the new technology of "Organosilane Coupling Agent" into a product. It greatly increased the strength and wear resistance of rubber products after being added to rubber. On June 7 this year, he brought a batch of purchased instruments to Dinghu. He was sitting upright in a southbound train near Hengyang, which was blocked by students as hot as the weather for 4 days and 4 nights. Many passengers could not bear it and got off to find a cool place, but he dared not move; nearby farmers took advantage of the situation, and even a bowl of porridge dared to be sold for 10 yuan. He had only 4 big notes in his pocket, fearing the long journey ahead, and also had an empty stomach, until the train passed Shaoguan, thinking that there would definitely be no more traffic jams, he finally opened his stomach, and the money was wiped out...

Li Zhengbin, before coming to the Science and Technology City, was a deputy director of the cultural bureau of a certain region. He came with a precious and priceless gift: all his family's savings over the years, and in the tight monetary climate, he went to several enterprises unyieldingly and borrowed tens of millions of yuan in goods. On one hand, he was wealthy, and on the other hand, he spent a little more money like squandering. Every time he went on a business trip, whether to Wuhan or Beijing, he was always hard-seated and dusty...

Zhu Zhengfu, a master's student in international law, after graduation, was assigned to the famous Wanbao Electrical Appliances Group Company. At the age of 25, he became the deputy director of the Trade Development Department of the company. He did foreign trade business and had many opportunities to study abroad or settle down. A typical white-collar scholar, but when he spoke, it was like a stone falling to the ground: "There is a Chinese idiom: fish die, net break, but the situation is often that the fish slip away, and the net is not broken. Now the country is in trouble, and everyone is running abroad. What's the use? No matter how beautiful it is, it blooms on someone else's branch. Chinese people with blood and ability should toughen their bones and work in the country!" He planned with a few peers and rushed to the Science and Technology City together. Now, he is busy with foreign businessmen to quickly implement the construction and production of two new technologies, "Grass Fiber Agricultural Film" and "Coal Gas Waste Liquid into Coal Gas"...

The heart is in Dinghu, the soul is in Dinghu.

Dinghu, with its flowing springs, flying waterfalls, ancient trees, and beautiful scenery, is the most concentrated place for subtropical plants and animals, listed by the United Nations as one of the natural reserves, with tourists coming all year round. It is 70 kilometers away from Guangzhou, connected by railways and highways. The Science and Technology Industrial City, covering an area of two square kilometers, is located between Dinghu Mountain and the West River.

Dinghu District is a newly established urban area based on a rural township. The People's Government of the district has keen insight, and the Science and Technology Industrial City, from planning to opening, only took one month, firmly deciding to use science and technology as a powerful driving force for the development of the local economy. And he and his partners, through two years of practice, deeply felt that if there is a good and stable small climate and small environment, it will attract the "intellectual flow" into a permanent world, and people, the carrier of human endless creation, will leap like tigers and pursue like dragons, coming in droves, forming a smart-intensive area similar to Silicon Valley in the United States, Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan, and Zhongguancun in Beijing. This is a vivid intelligence complementary structure: the collision of the two is like a storm surge; the harmony of the two is like a heavenly melody...

Not to mention anything else, just the investment, according to the plan, it is 2 billion yuan, and he and his partners decided not to ask the state for a single cent. It can be seen that all this will not become a lively reality from a magnificent plan in three or five years. In the meantime, there will definitely not be a lack of difficulties...

Since he has crossed the cold and warm yesterday and come to the day when the foundation is laid, he has no reason not to believe that he will definitely embrace the day when new buildings rise...

Is it a bit vague? No, Dinghu has only slightly revealed its future information to the motherland. On November 11, the "Changjiang Daily" published an advertisement for the recruitment of the Science and Technology Industrial City in the eye-catching position, with the title "If you have foresight, come here to invest; if you are a strong person, come here to start a business." In a few days, nearly 400 intellectuals, cadres, and other people from Wuhan City alone signed up, many of whom had to give up their eye-catching positions and superior living conditions...

He always insisted on not writing about himself, and if he really had to write, he would not write his name.

Maybe, just as he did not want to share any more glory, he did not want to attract any unnecessary trouble. Maybe, he thought that even the most glorious name, compared to the eternal heaven and earth, and the endless creative spirit of mankind, was only a few specks of dust, a wisp of smoke...

Not writing is not writing, it is not important. What is important is that he is not a flying saucer, he has not disappeared from this era of passion and innovation.

专栏：国庆报告文学征文

    不是飞碟
    ——关于一个人和一群人的素描
    胡平
    一、1986年的一天，国庆的喜庆气氛，还洋溢在满城若焰的红棉树上，一个三十二、三岁的年轻人，随数千南下的旅客走上了车站广场。
    广州，阳光绚丽，色彩缤纷，犹如洪波推涌、难知深浅的大海。一片惊异而又兴奋、困惑而又憧憬的目光，几乎任何人跌进这座城市的怀抱，都会觉得自己只是一条鱼儿……
    广州也打量着他。一身廉价料子的西装，袖子与后襟处皱得像七八十岁老妪的脸。手摸了摸口袋里仅有的50元钱，嘴角掠过一丝苦涩的笑，随即拎起个大红颜色的箱子，活像巴尔扎克笔下的外省人到了巴黎。不知广州当时是否作过如是之想：那口大箱子是来一片灯红酒绿中捞世界的。不过几天，他就会舒畅地消化丰盛的早茶，熟练地打起金利来领带，给人递上一张带香水味的名片。不过是满城林林总总的公司里又多了一家公司，满街似过江之鲫的经理里又多了一个经理……
    他走着，步履难说是轻松还是沉重。他也觉得自己是一条鱼儿，不过不是在渺小的意义上，他从未觉得生命的渺小，一位伟人的话于他铭心刻骨：给我一个支点，我就能转动一个地球！
    风涛召唤他来，洪波吸引他来。
    他是一条跃跃欲试，频临搏击的鱼儿；
    他是一条被自身的激情，也被某种灼热的痛苦快要烧熟的鱼儿……
    二、1984年，蓝天高洁，鸽哨鸣响，雏菊若金。北京，以自己一年里最好的季节，拥抱了受团中央邀请来自祖国各地的14位青年改革积极分子。
    在团中央四楼会议室，中组部青年干部局，在中直机关礼堂、政协礼堂，在北大、人大、北航，最后还在靠中南海北门的一幢幽静的平房，人们以极大的热情和兴趣，欢迎着他们，倾听他们的发言。其中，他和伙伴们崇尚智力、开发智力的业绩，更引起了普遍注目……
    1983年8月，他辞去一所全国著名高校学报编辑的职务，当了一家科普杂志的负责人。此后一年内，他和几个伙伴们把奄奄一息的刊物办活了，又办了一张发行量达80多万的少年科普报纸，出了一批有价值的书。旧债还清，还赚了30多万元，然后设立个“少年科学奖基金会”，办起了有3000多学员的经济管理大学……就凭这令人目眩耳鸣的速度和业绩，他被评为当年省直机关优秀共产党员。
    他以为，屡屡错过历史性机会的中国，历史性的机会已经无多了。今天，改革的新星升起在地平线上，如何去抓住星辰的斗柄，如何去利用星辰的光芒，如何在她的照彻下写就一个史诗般的时代，当代的年轻人应该交上一份响亮的答卷！
    必须用一种崭新的眼光来打量自己：人不如一根脆弱的芦苇，芦苇能在野外生存；人不如一只蚂蚁，蚂蚁能驮起重于自身150倍的东西。然而，人征服了自然，改造了自然，究其根本就在于人有智力。人的智商有高有低，但每个人的智力总有冬眠的南极，拔萃如爱因斯坦氏，也认为自己的智力只用了30％。而且从总体上讲，群体智力的互补开发是无限的，对此，肖伯纳翁有一句名言：两人各交换一个苹果，每人只能得一个苹果；两人各交换一个思想，每人可以得两个思想。
    他强调：得不断地开发自己，首先是智力的开发。当今朝阳产业是知识密集的产业，今天的社会已是知识密集的社会。一颗貌似缓和与合作的小小寰球，一场没有硝烟的智力大战已经爆发。可以肯定地说，哪个国家智力开发得好，哪个国家就一定富强！
    车轮深沉、铿锵地滚过广袤的华北平原，向着南方，南方……
    听着这车轮的前进声，他想，列车多么像当今这个革故鼎新、壮怀激烈的时代啊！
    真好，自己坐上了这趟列车，伙伴们坐上了这趟列车……
    三、他与北京两位副部长级的老干部打过交道。
    一位叫陈伯村，远在抗战时就在中央组织部工作。1984年，这位70余岁的长者是中央派来调整省委班子工作组的副组长，陈伯村找他来病榻前了解情况，听得饶有兴味，一聊竟聊了5个小时，他告辞时问他：“年轻人，你们搞改革不容易啊，要不要我这个老头子给你帮什么忙？”
    另一位叫王兴让，建国初期就是商业部副部长。1986年是国务院派到省里的检查组组长。老人了解了他的问题，最后，这位在战争年代失去一条臂膀的老人，用剩下的一只手拍着他的肩说：“我看你这个年轻人呐，越调查越干净，越调查越可爱。不过以后干事可得注意，别毛毛糙糙，该有的手续都得齐全……”
    在小学，哪怕是寒风料峭如刀的冬天，他也没穿过袜子。关于有一双袜子的梦，他做过不少，但醒来就忘了。在中学，家离县城100多华里，自然买不起车票，回家就只有靠步行。晨星寥落时启程，银河西斜了归家，一盏如豆的油灯下，母亲用针挑破儿子脚掌上那野果一样的血泡，眼泪也吧哒哒地往下掉……他却没有眼泪。然而，陈伯村的两句话，让他眼眶潮热了。王兴让的一番话，叫他鼻子酸楚了。
    一年之内，编辑部搬了5次，折腾了5次。联系几十所高等院校、科研单位的专家、学者，好不容易组成了8本书的写作班子，日里夜里沙沙写了两个多月，可原本答应出书的出版社，一下又翻了脸。为在六一儿童节前夕，将100万份报纸赠给孩子们，编辑部几个人自己分期、打包、装运，大卡车足足拉了3趟运到火车站，对方则将一类包裹变成了三类包裹托运，费用也由几百元窜成几千元。这边，囊中羞涩，那边，天阴欲雨，堆成小山似的报纸转眼间将会化为一片浆泥……真是一路上断不了景阳岗、野猪林！他和伙伴们磨着脚皮，练着嘴皮，厚着脸皮，整日里火急火燎，碰碰磕磕，忙得连一岁的孩子患了肠炎，发生脱水、性命交关之时，他也未去医院看过一眼……
    他图啥呢？图个正处级的乌纱帽吗？他用心琢磨过“领袖”这两个字，汉字的寓意太深刻了，领就是领子，袖就是袖子，而衣服先脏先破的正是这两处。领袖们都该先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐，何况自己一个小单位的头头！图发财吗？清风两袖，家徒四壁，没有彩电，没有冰箱，他办公桌的抽屉里常放着一袋袋的方便面，他敢梆梆响地拍着胸膛，对检查组说：“若查出我有一分钱的经济问题，就判我一年徒刑，若查出我有一角钱的不干净，就判我10年徒刑……”
    闻名遐迩的他，一度销声匿迹了。
    人们众说纷纭：他中箭落马了，他破产了。更有甚者：他进大牢里吃六两米去了！
    当王兴让的那一拍后，他便在寻找一个新的爆发点，在这个爆发点上，自己所释放出来的才智和能量将是最大限度的，以证明自己果敢地结束这五味俱全的一年，并不意味着别的什么，只意味着落下序幕，由此走向正剧……
    四、不仅是出于性格的魅力，总会有热血青年和他聚在一起。
    李秋波，武汉大学经济系毕业，原是广东省外经委的干部。成果，华中农学院机械制造系毕业，原在中科院武汉仪器厂工作。潘公侠，复旦大学化学系毕业，原在上海长风华工厂工作。邝平，珠影演员，主演过《珍珍的发屋》等影片。一日，加上他和另一个人，5人仿着澳大利亚一家公司的广告画照了一张合影。那广告是推销无人自动喂狗设备，画上五条主人不在家的狗聚在一起，脸上都是饥饿、凄惶之色。下面是一行字：它们为什么悲哀？
    一段时间，5人的处境也够凄惶的。虽在某单位租下几间空房，房里却只有一个3条腿的破沙发。邝平从家里搬来一张钢丝床，其他人则只能睡地板，或以书作枕，或以倒空水的暖瓶作枕，一睡睡半年。因潮湿受寒，李秋波双腿都烂了。囊中更是拮据，即使自己开伙，也常吃了上顿愁下顿。
    他和伙伴们在精神上却是充实的，他们最终在竞争气息最强烈的广州站住了。
    他不是豪门望族子弟，弄不来批文、贷款。他出身于农家，信奉农民的真理：种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，不会做买空卖空一类的活计。他呼唤商品经济，却又十分卑薄商品经济的初级阶段所极易煽起的人的原始欲望。他凭借的是自己的脑袋，一颗似乎长了24只眼睛的脑袋。
    这两打眼睛冷冷地瞧着那两年几乎全民经商的滚滚阵势。许多人以为，商品经济就是朝为秦天暮为楚地的货物大倒腾，就是觥筹交错、腾腾烟雾里的抬价压价，就是利润在流通中猎犬般追逐、猴子般翻着跟头……其实，商品经济最基本的方式是商品生产，商品的竞争归根到底是科学技术的竞争，是人才的竞争。若没有以科学技术为强大后盾的商品经济，尽管也一度热风吹雨，云集影从，但终归是个畸形的胎儿。
    他发觉，过去在中国总说上海人做生意门槛精，现在也许上海人得称广东人为师了。广东毗邻港澳，地缘似乎决定了血缘里就潜伏有贸易的因子，一逢改革开放，常领天下风气之先，那份银针般的精明，那份气球般鼓足的胆子，很快便表现为一股盎然，机巧的活力。但这活力终是有限的，由于历史上的文化渊源比不得内地，建国后较长时间实行的某些错误政策，广东的科学技术谈不上发达，高素质人才相对缺乏，每万人中的大学生比例，广东高不了西藏多少……
    于是，他和伙伴们在国家有关部门的批准下，在广州创办了一家属全民所有制企业的经济技术发展公司，从事高技术、新产品的开发，将沿海地区无可替代的活力与内地的智力优势结合起来，走一条以智力开发财力，以财力开发智力，为经济建设服务的道路。
    国家并没有给一分钱。又是一回白手起家，一帮陆续从内地来的书生，避己所短，扬己所长，躲广东之热，寻广东之需，不过两年，就让公司足以雄冠南国。他们摸索出一整套行之有效的技术开发的基本方法，所开发的“通用港务管理系统”、“超快干氨基烘添”、“乳化燃油添加剂及装置”、“微机远程多功能电视电话系统”、“卫星接受天线”、“鱼类保活保鲜剂”等一大批新技术已在广东及沿海地区应用或生产，经济效益须以百万计。公司不仅与全国几十所大专院校、10多家科研机构和专利机构建立了密切联系和长期合作，有了较多的技术信息来源；公司自身也形成多学科、多专业、多功能的智力互补结构，不少人拥有工程师、高级工程师、副教授、教授等职称。
    当今年8月，他又一次决定战略转移，结束公司，受广东省肇庆市鼎湖区人民政府之邀，进军鼎湖，兴办我国首家民间高技术开发区——科技实业城时，科技城的营业执照上注明其固定资产为1000万元。
    从最困难的日子里走来，他老哼着一只歌：“没有吃，没有穿，自有敌人送上前。没有枪，没有炮，敌人会给我们造……”在他心目中，这“敌人”不是别的什么，正是他无时不在寻觅、无刻不在顶礼的新技术。
    不会再掏不出一顿早茶的钱了，那张5个人的合影将化成人生旅途上一段温馨、隽永的回忆。他却还是那个来到巴黎的外省人，皱巴巴的西装领口又板又亮，恍如围着的是一块理发师用的刮刀布；当一个什么主意，金雨点似地纷纷来了，常激动得光着袜子在房里走路。公司规定，实际上也是他自我规定，总经理出差每晚住宿不得超过20元，如今北京、上海、深圳，稍有点样子的饭店，哪个会对这20元笑脸相迎？他不知超过这标准多少回了，还有与客户应酬往来费用，约6000元单据，他一把火烧了……
    那口大号红箱子，除了几件换洗衣服，依然空空荡荡。
    改革不容易，但始终抱着一个清纯的动机去改革，那就更难。
    五、千难万险，中国总有自己的脊梁。
    邱新发，原是武汉大学化学系副教授。年近五旬，抛家别子，一个人呆在广东番禺一年多，从设计到基建、投产，还包括亲自钻到机体下紧螺母，将“有机硅偶联剂”的新技术变成了产品。它加进橡胶后，大大增强了橡胶制品的强度和耐磨力。今年6月7日，他带一批采购来的仪器进军鼎湖，正端坐在衡阳附近南下的一列火车里，列车被与天气一样酷热的学生堵了4天4夜，许多旅客熬不过，下车去找一块清凉，他不敢动；附近的农民们随行就市，一碗粥也敢要10元钱，他口袋里唯有4张大团结，恐前途漫漫，也唯有饥肠辘辘，直到车过韶关，思量再不会有堵车的了，才放开肚皮，钞票被一举歼灭……
      李正斌，来科技城前，是某地区文化局的副局长。人来，还带来一份有价又无价的重礼：倾家所有的多年积蓄，还有在银根紧缩的气候下，去几家
  企业不屈不挠化来的几十万元货款。一边腰缠万贯，一边多花了两个钱好似暴殄天物，每回出差，无论武汉，还是北京，他都是一路硬座，一路风尘……
    朱征夫，国际法硕士研究生，毕业后分在如雷贯耳的万宝电器集团公司，25岁便当了公司贸易发展部副部长。做的是外贸生意，不乏出国留学或是定居的机遇。典型的一个白面书生，讲起话却作掷地金石之响：“中国有句成语：鱼死网破，但情况往往是鱼溜了，网未破。眼下国家有困难，纷纷撒腿向国外跑有什么意思？花再绚丽也开在人家的枝上。有血性、有本事的中国人，就硬着骨头在国内干！”他策划了几个同龄人，一起投奔了科技城。现在，他正忙着和外商一起，尽快将“草纤维农用地膜”和“煤气废液变煤气”的两项新技术实施建厂投产……
    情系鼎湖啊，魂系鼎湖。
    鼎湖，流泉飞瀑，古木参天，风光旖旎，是亚热带动植物最集中的地方，被联合国列为自然保护区之一，终年游客如织。这里离广州70余公里，有铁路、公路相连。鼎湖山下是奔腾的西江，乘船5小时可抵香港。占地两平方公里的科技实业城，就选在鼎湖山与西江之间。
    鼎湖区是在农村集镇基础上组建不久的城区建制。区人民政府慧眼独具，科技实业城从酝酿到开业，仅用了一个月时间，铁定主意要以科学技术作为发展本地区经济的强大推进器。而他和伙伴们，通过两年来的实践，则深感如果有一个良好稳定的小气候，小环境，就会把“智力流”引进永存的天地，人类延绵不绝的创造载体的人，就会虎扑龙追，望风而至，从而形成一个类似美国西部硅谷、台湾新竹科学工业园区、北京中关村的智力密集区。这又是一个气韵如此生动的智力互补结构：两者的碰撞，好似惊涛；两者的和谐，犹如天籁……
    不说别的，仅投资，按规划得20亿元，他和伙伴们决心不要国家拨一分钱。可见，这一切不会在三年五载里由宏伟的规划变为鲜活的现实。其间，也断不会少景阳岗、野猪林……
    既然越过了乍暖乍寒的昨天，走到了基石已定的今天，他就没有理由不去相信一定能拥抱新楼迭起的明天……
    是不是有点空泛？不，鼎湖只是稍稍向祖国透露了自己未来的信息，11月初的《长江日报》上，在报眼位置，以“你有远见就来这里投资，你是强者就到这里创业”为题，登载了科技实业城的招聘广告，几天之内，仅武汉市就有近400名知识分子、干部和其他人员报名，其中不少人得舍弃瞩目的地位和优越的生活条件……
    六、他始终坚持不写自己，若实在要写，就不写名字。
    也许，如同他不想再分享什么荣誉一样，他也不想再招惹什么不必要的麻烦。也许，他觉得再显赫的名字，比起日月永存的天地，人类延绵不绝的创造精神，不过是几点尘埃，一抹烟云……
    不写就不写吧，这无关紧要。重要的是，他不是飞碟，他没有从这个壮怀激烈、革故鼎新的时代消失。
