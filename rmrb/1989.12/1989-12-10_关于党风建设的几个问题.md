The Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party both emphasized the need to strengthen party building, which is the fundamental guarantee for the Party to fully play its core leadership role in socialist modernization. Party style construction, as an important component of party building, is even more important and arduous under the conditions of being in power and reform and opening up. Therefore, it is very important to seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of party style construction, to raise awareness and unify thinking on some key issues, in order to steadfastly improve party style construction.

The issue of party style for a ruling party indeed relates to the life and death of the party.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee has attached great importance to party style construction. In November 1980, Comrade Chen Yun proposed the judgment that "the issue of party style for a ruling party is a matter of life and death for the party." This is a profound summary and insightful generalization of the positive and negative experiences of our party and the international communist movement. It is a fundamental guiding ideology for party building under the conditions of being in power and reform and opening up. It has important significance for maintaining the advanced nature of our party and realizing the party's program and purpose in the new historical period. Over the past decade, this scientific judgment has been included in important party documents several times and has been repeatedly affirmed by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries led by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It is well-known within and outside the party and has had a major impact on the political life of the party and the state. At the same time, the understanding of this judgment within the party is not the same, and there are even significant differences. Some people think that the issue of party style is not that serious and take a dismissive attitude towards improving party style. Some people only understand it abstractly and lack a sense of urgency about "life and death." In recent years, under the influence of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's erroneous guiding ideology of downplaying the role of the party, party style construction has been weakened, and the party consciousness of some comrades within the party has become even more diluted. The ambiguity and deviation in understanding have formed various obstacles in the practice of party style construction, making the work of improving party style tight and loose, making it difficult to consolidate the achievements already made, and making it impossible to correct the negative and corrupt phenomena that have spread. There are many opinions within and outside the party. Currently, to strengthen party style construction, we must further understand the essence and great significance of Comrade Chen Yun's judgment from the perspective of combining theory with practice.

The proletarian vanguard nature of our party and its purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly are the intrinsic basis for its inexhaustible vitality and strong fighting force. There is no doubt that people judge whether our party represents the interests of the working class and the broad masses of the people, not only by its declarations and slogans, but also by its actions. Specifically, it is about what kind of line, policy, and principles the party formulates and implements; it is about what kind of behavior and style the party organizations and party members have. These two aspects are interrelated and inseparable. Correct lines, policies, and principles determine the basic behavior of party organizations and party members, and they are realized in the actions of party organizations and party members. The masses see the specific activities of party organizations and party members every day. How these party organizations and party members treat work, treat the masses, treat various interests and social contradictions, the masses know best, are most sensitive to, and pay the most attention to, and from this they evaluate our party and party members, and decide their attitude towards the party. The "old Eighth Route Army style" and the "Yan'an style" once won the high trust of the people of the whole country for our party and the people's army. The good party style and social atmosphere in the early 1950s are still unforgettable. During the "Cultural Revolution," when the party made a comprehensive mistake, evil winds and trends prevailed within the party, damaging the party's image among the masses. Since the reform and opening up, our party has consistently adhered to the Marxist line and policy, winning the support of the people. However, the reason why the party's prestige is not as high as expected and why there are still many opinions among the broad masses, to the extent that a small number of people hostile to the party and socialism can incite political turmoil and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, causing serious damage to the party and the cause of socialism, is directly related to the various phenomena that have harmed the interests of the masses and have spread within the party for a period of time. This shows that the existence of certain improper and corrupt phenomena within the party and government is not, as some comrades think, an insignificant issue, but a serious political issue. If some of our comrades did not have a deep sense of the harm it caused in the past, they should have enough understanding after experiencing the recent turmoil and rebellion.

Facts have repeatedly told us that the good or bad party style determines the direction of people's hearts, and the direction of people's hearts determines the fate of the party. That is to say, the issue of party style for a ruling party, in the final analysis, is about whether the party can adhere to the nature of the proletarian vanguard and maintain close ties with the masses, and serve the people wholeheartedly. On this fundamental issue, if the wrong choice of behavior is made, the party will lose the trust and support of the people and will face the danger of failure and decline. In this sense, understanding the issue of party style as Comrade Chen Yun's judgment is not an exaggeration or scaremongering, but a scientific reflection of objective laws, indicating that the Chinese Communists have maintained a clear mind and a sense of historical responsibility in the face of power.

In different historical periods, the specific content of party style issues and the problems that party style construction needs to solve are not exactly the same. During the Yan'an period, the party focused on opposing subjectivism, sectarianism, and party jargon. In the early days of liberation, the party emphasized opposing bureaucratism and subjectivism, as well as arrogance and complacency. Today, the party requires the inheritance and development of a series of good styles, and the elimination of negative and corrupt phenomena within the party. However, the fundamental task and goal of party style construction have always been consistent, which is to maintain the advanced nature and purpose of the party and to prevent it from becoming detached from the people. This is even more prominent under the new situation of reform and opening up. From the actual situation, phenomena such as using power for personal gain, not being responsible for the party and the people's cause, not listening to the opinions of the masses, and not caring about the sufferings of the masses, as well as extravagance and waste, have always been the focus of the party's efforts to correct, and their greatest danger is to become detached from the masses.

Regarding the danger of the proletarian party becoming detached from the masses after taking power, Marx, Lenin, and the leaders of our party have always attached great importance to it, indicating that this is a major issue in the construction of a ruling party. Historical experience has repeatedly proven that errors and setbacks often occur within the party. In the new situation, the existence of negative and corrupt phenomena within the party that are detached from the masses is a major hidden danger that harms the party's body and threatens the party's life. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in response to the recent political turmoil that if corruption, especially within the party, is not punished, there is indeed a risk of failure. We summarize the past and consider the future, and we must realize that the party was born, developed, and grew strong in close contact with the masses. Without the support of the broad masses of the people, the party cannot survive for a single day. After the party took power, the danger of becoming detached from the masses increased. All comrades in the party should link this issue with the fate of the party and, from this height, understand the importance and urgency of improving party style and carrying out the fight against corruption. We must steadfastly inherit and carry forward the party's fine traditions and styles, and persistently correct various improper and corrupt phenomena, forever plant our roots among the masses, and restore and develop the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses. In this way, our party will definitely be able to withstand any storm and stand unshakable.

We must correctly handle the relationship between party style construction and clean governance.

Party style construction and clean governance are both crucial to party building and political power building. Correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the two is an important issue that needs to be addressed urgently. For a period of time, party style construction has been weakened and diluted, leading to the spread of improper and corrupt phenomena within the party, shaking the confidence of the broad masses of cadres and the people within and outside the party to fight against corrupt phenomena, and making it difficult for clean governance to be effectively carried out.

Clean governance is a behavioral norm for officials, requiring them to be incorruptible and not to accept bribes or embezzle. The ancients said: "Not accepting is called clean, not defiling is called pure." Being clean in governance is not only today's requirement for cadres, but also in ancient China, they advocated "abolishing corruption and establishing cleanliness." Not only is it our requirement for cadres, but some places abroad also advocate and practice clean governance. Of course, in feudal society and capitalist society, the ruling class, determined by its class nature, cannot truly achieve clean governance. "Three years of clean governor, ten million snowflake silver" is a true portrayal of feudal officials bullying the people. Our socialist state government is a government that serves the people, and its nature and purpose determine that we must practice clean politics. Only under the leadership of the proletarian party, can a truly clean government be built. The facts also show that the vast majority of our cadres are diligent in their work, hardworking, frugal, clean, and selfless on various fronts and at various posts. Clean governance is an important part of the construction of our people's democratic dictatorship, and its fundamental task and goal is to always maintain the public servant nature of national and people's cadres.

Party style is the consistent attitude and behavior of party organizations and party members in all aspects of ideology, politics, work, study, and life, and is the manifestation of the party's nature and worldview in the actions of party organizations and party members. Party style construction includes two aspects: inheriting and carrying forward the party's fine styles and correcting improper styles. The party's fine styles are formed and developed in the struggle against improper styles. In the long-term revolutionary and construction practice, the Chinese Communist Party has formed a unique style of linking theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, criticism and self-criticism, self-reliance, and hard work, which reflects the most basic political characteristics of our party. Our party is the vanguard of the working class, and party members are the advanced elements of the working class. The fundamental task of party style construction is to arm the whole party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so that all Communist Party members can always maintain the political character and spiritual style of the vanguard of the working class.

Party style construction and clean governance are both related and distinct, and we cannot only talk about their relationship without mentioning their differences, nor can we only talk about their differences without mentioning their relationship. Some of the issues that clean governance needs to solve are also important content of the work to correct improper styles within the party. We are a ruling party, and a large number of party members and cadres work in state organs. In government organs, Communist Party members account for more than 60%, and in leading cadres at the county level and above, Communist Party members account for more than 90%. Party members and state cadres have a dual identity, requiring both adherence to party standards and compliance with the behavioral norms of state cadres. The cleanliness of Communist Party members directly determines the degree of cleanliness of state power organs, and the good or bad of clean governance in state power organs also relates to the party's image and prestige among the masses. Therefore, party style construction and clean governance cannot be separated from each other and replaced by each other, but should promote each other. The ongoing clean governance work has played an active role in eliminating some negative and corrupt phenomena in the government, alleviating some of the masses' dissatisfaction, and promoting the construction of political power and party style construction. It should be continued. However, we should not neglect or even abandon party style construction because of this. Party style construction relates to what standards we use to demand our party members and what kind of thinking we use to build the party. The Chinese Communist Party is the decisive force for maintaining long-term stability in China and is the strong core leading all ethnic groups to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Doing a good job in party style construction has overall and decisive significance. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "To insist on the leadership of the party, we must improve the leadership of the party and improve the style of the party." It can be seen that doing a good job in party style construction is an important measure to insist on the leadership of the party. Strengthening party style construction requires Communist Party members to regulate their words and deeds according to the party's constitution, have a firm communist faith, remember the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, inherit and carry forward the party's fine traditions and styles, maintain the noble character and character of Communists, and not just stop at keeping oneself clean and not being greedy. That is to say, party style construction has a higher starting point than clean governance, with richer and more extensive content, and higher requirements for Communist Party members. A party member and cadre must have the basic condition of being clean. At the same time, they must always maintain the advanced nature of the party. This is precisely the difference between Communists and clean officials.

Party style construction plays a core leading role in the construction of political style and social atmosphere. If party style construction is done well, it will drive political style and social atmosphere, and solving the problem of corrupt governance will have a solid foundation. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "As long as our party's style is completely upright, the people of the whole country will learn from us. Those outside the party who have bad styles, as long as they are kind-hearted, will learn from us and correct their mistakes, thus influencing the whole nation." It can be seen that doing a good job in party style is the key to doing a good job in political style and social atmosphere. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the new central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core adhered to the strategic policy of simultaneously promoting material civilization and spiritual civilization, vigorously strengthened the construction of the party's ideology, style, organization, and system, and led the whole party and the people of the whole country to resolutely and steadily carry out the fight against corruption. Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council decided to do seven things that the people care about, reflecting the spirit of hard work from the central level, some of which have already seen results, and some are being seriously implemented, boosting the morale of the party and the people. Currently, the momentum of party style construction is good. We should closely follow the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points," continue to implement the policy of being resolute and persistent, and carry out party style construction in a solid and practical manner. We should use good party style to ensure the smooth implementation of the goals of further rectification and deepening of reform proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session, and ensure the deepening of the party's various work. We should insist on leading cadres and leading organs taking the lead, starting from ourselves, and setting an example at all levels; we should insist on using good party style to drive political style and social atmosphere, promoting each other, and comprehensive governance; we should insist on working hard to improve the political quality of party members, and closely combine ideological education, strict discipline enforcement, and system construction; we should insist on the whole party working on party style, with leaders taking the lead, and establishing and implementing a responsibility system; we should insist on relying on the masses, and build the elimination of corrupt phenomena and the correction of bad styles on the solid foundation of the broad masses of the people. It can be believed that through the unremitting efforts of the whole party, we will definitely be able to do a good job in party style construction in the process of reform and opening up, fully play the role of party organizations as fighting fortresses and the exemplary role of Communist Party members, and establish a lofty image of the party.

To do a good job in party style, we must pay attention to improving the political quality of party members.

Our party has more than 48 million party members. Whether they can adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, whether they can truly serve the people wholeheartedly, determines the overall spiritual style of the party and the success or failure of party style construction. For individual party members, the issue of party style ultimately comes down to a worldview issue and a party nature issue. Party style is the external manifestation of party nature, and the high or low political quality of party members has a decisive influence on their ideological style and work style. Clarifying this is very important for establishing and adhering to the correct guiding ideology of party style construction.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the action guidelines of our party. Arming the whole party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and continuously improving the political quality of party members is the ideological foundation for doing a good job in party style construction. The Yan'an Rectification Movement was actually a Marxist educational movement. The Party Central Committee, with Comrade Mao Zedong as the core, focused on improving the Marxist level and basic political quality of the whole party, effectively carried out the struggle against subjectivism, sectarianism, and party jargon, and made ideological and theoretical preparations for defeating the Japanese invaders and winning the victory of the new democratic revolution. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Chen Yun, and other older-generation proletarian revolutionaries have repeatedly emphasized that the whole party should learn Marxist basic theory and improve political quality and the ability to distinguish right from wrong. The whole party has also done a lot of work in this regard, significantly improving the party's ability to link theory with practice and use the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of dialectical and historical materialism to analyze and solve problems. However, at the same time, it cannot be ignored that in the new situation of reform and opening up, a considerable number of party organizations have neglected the study of political theory and relaxed the improvement of the political quality of party members. The situation that some comrades have joined the party organizationally but not ideologically or have not completely joined the party ideologically, as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong early on, still exists today. The problems in the political quality of party members have seriously damaged the ideological style of the party. Some party members have a shaky theoretical foundation, an unstable political stance, a shallow understanding of the party's line, policy, and principles, and adopt a pragmatic attitude, wavering politically, and even losing their way in the critical moment of the party and the state's life and death, standing on the opposite side of the party, causing a very bad influence on the party; some party members have abandoned the communist ideal and the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, and non-proletarian thoughts such as individualism and indulgence in enjoyment have swollen maliciously, and they have fallen in the face of the corruption of money and material. Within the party, improper styles such as using power for personal gain, extravagance, and waste, and serious irresponsible bureaucratism have spread and developed, and in some places and departments, they have even become more and more serious. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out profoundly that the biggest mistake in the past ten years is education, mainly ideological and political education. Practice has proven that it is the same within the party. To do a good job in party style construction, we must pay attention to improving the political quality of party members.

In recent years, the whole party has accelerated the pace of system construction, making the party's various work further standardized and institutionalized, and promoting the party's various constructions. However, some comrades have neglected and abandoned ideological education while focusing on system construction, weakening party style construction. Ideological education and system construction are both basic measures to strengthen party style construction and should be organically combined and promote each other. Emphasizing one aspect at the expense of the other will be counterproductive and will not achieve the desired results. We should seriously summarize the experiences and lessons, and in all work, at any time and under any circumstances, we should pay attention to ideological education. System construction has a process of gradual development and improvement and cannot be achieved overnight; the system itself also needs to be formulated and implemented by people. With what guiding ideology and attitude to formulate and implement the system, the social effect will naturally be very different. Without ideological education, system construction itself cannot be truly successful. Exaggerating the function of ideological education and neglecting the important role of the system in regulating people's behavior has been proven to be unworkable in practice. Similarly, putting all hope on the system and thinking that everything will be fine once the system is in place is also one-sided. The result is often that system construction is not done well, and ideological education is abandoned, which instead aggravates the spread of improper styles and corrupt phenomena within and outside the party. Ideological education is a fine tradition of the party, and paying attention to its role in party style construction is essentially to give full play to the initiative and creativity of all party members and party organizations as the basic force of party style construction, to lay the ideological foundation for system construction, strict discipline enforcement, and other work. It is completely consistent with system construction.

Insisting on the education of party nature, party style, and party discipline is the key link to improving the political quality of party members. In the entire process of socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up, all comrades in the party should, while transforming the objective world, strive to transform the subjective world, firmly establish the Marxist worldview and methodology, and continuously strengthen party nature. At present, we should pay attention to educating party members to remember the great ideal and goal of communism, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and resolutely oppose various erroneous trends of thought that attack and slander the party's leadership and the socialist system. In the face of various complex contradictions and problems, we should always maintain a clear mind and adhere to the correct political direction. We should educate party members to remember the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, be willing to be public servants, be clean and upright, always take the interests of the people as the fundamental starting point and destination of their words and deeds, consciously resist the infiltration of exploitative class ideology, resist various material interests, establish the spirit of public-mindedness, and never use power for personal gain. We should educate party members to strengthen their sense of organizational discipline, adhere to the principle of democratic centralism, and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual in any situation, putting the interests of the party and the people first, and consciously maintaining consistency in speech and action with the party's line, policy, and principles. We should educate party members to always maintain the revolutionary spirit of hard work, put hardship first and enjoyment last, share weal and woe with the masses, take the lead in living a frugal life, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste and special treatment in living conditions, and always maintain close ties with the masses.

Our party is composed of millions of advanced elements who are loyal to the cause of communism. Their spirit of bravery and hard work has inspired the vast army of the people to follow the party to overthrow the old system and build a new China. A team of party members with high political awareness and close ties with the masses is the source of the party's strength and the key to maintaining and carrying forward the party's fine styles. As long as the whole party strives to improve its political quality under new historical conditions and works hard in various aspects, it will be able to raise the party's various work, including party style construction, to a new level.

    关于党风建设的几个问题
    陈作霖
    党的十三届四中、五中全会都指出，要大力加强党的建设，这是充分发挥党在社会主义现代化建设中的核心领导作用的基本保证。党风建设作为党的建设的重要组成部分，在执政和改革开放条件下，任务更加重要和艰巨。为此，认真总结党风建设的经验教训，在一些重要问题上提高认识，统一思想，对于坚定不移地搞好党风建设是很重要的。
    执政党党风问题确实关系到党的生死存亡
    党的十一届三中全会以来，党中央十分重视党风建设。1980年11月，陈云同志提出“执政党的党风问题是有关党的生死存亡的问题”的论断，这是对我们党和国际共产主义运动正反经验的一个深刻总结和精辟概括，是执政和改革开放条件下党的建设的一个基本的指导思想，对于在新的历史时期保持党的先进性质，实现党的纲领、宗旨，有着重要的意义。近十年来，这个科学的论断几次载入党的重要文献，一再为以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家所肯定，为党内外所熟知，在党和国家政治生活中产生了重大的影响。同时，党内对这一论断的理解，其程度也是不尽相同的，甚至差距很大。有的认为党风问题并没有那么严重，对搞好党风抱无关紧要的态度。有的只限于作抽象的理解，对“生死存亡”缺乏现实的紧迫感。近年来，在赵紫阳同志淡化党的作用的错误指导思想影响下，党风建设受到削弱，党内一些同志的党风意识更加淡薄。认识上的模糊和偏差，形成了党风建设实践中的种种阻力，抓党风的工作时紧时松，已取得的成果难以巩固，滋长、蔓延开来的消极、腐败现象不能得到及时纠正，党内外意见甚多。当前要加强党风建设，首先应当从理论与实践的结合上进一步理解陈云同志论断的实质和重大意义。
    我们党的工人阶级先锋队性质和全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，是决定其具有不衰竭的生命力和强大战斗力的内在根据。毫无疑义，人们判断我们党是否代表工人阶级和最广大人民群众的利益，并不仅仅看其宣言、口号，而且要看其行动。主要是看党制定、执行什么样的路线和方针、政策；看党的组织和党员有着什么样的行为，什么样的作风。这两个方面是相互联系、密不可分的。正确的路线和方针、政策，决定着党组织和党员的基本行为，而它又是在党组织和党员的行动中实现的。群众每天直接看到的是具体的党组织、党员的活动。这些党组织和党员怎样对待工作、对待群众、对待各种利益关系和社会矛盾，群众最清楚、最敏感、最关注，并从中评价我们的党和党员，决定自己对党的态度。“老八路作风”、“延安作风”曾经赢得了全国人民对我们党和人民军队的高度信赖，五十年代初期那种良好的党风和社会风气至今令人难以忘怀。“文化大革命”期间，在党发生全局性错误的情况下，党内歪风邪气猖獗、泛滥，损害了党在群众中的形象。自改革开放以来，我们党一直坚持马克思主义的路线和政策，受到人民群众的拥护。但是，党的威信之所以没有期望的那样高，广大群众意见之所以还比较多，以致极少数敌视党和社会主义的分子能够煽动政治动乱和北京的反革命暴乱，给党和社会主义事业造成严重损害，这与一个时期以来党内滋长、蔓延开来的种种损害群众利益的不正之风和腐败现象有着直接的联系。这说明，党和政府中的某些不正之风和腐败现象的存在，不是像某些同志所认为的是个无足轻重的问题，而是一个严重的政治问题。对于它所造成的危害，如果说以往我们的一些同志还没有切肤之痛的话，在经历了前不久的动乱和暴乱之后，是应该有足够的认识了。
    事实一再告诉我们，党风的好坏决定人心的向背，而人心的向背又决定着党的命运。就是说，执政党的党风问题，说到底是党能否坚持工人阶级先锋队的性质，与群众能否保持密切的联系，全心全意为人民服务的问题。在这个根本问题上，如果作出错误的行为选择，党就会失去人民群众的信任和支持，就有失败和衰亡的危险。从这个意义上理解党风问题，就会认识到陈云同志的这个论断决不是夸大事实、危言耸听，而是对客观规律的科学反映，表明中国共产党人在权力面前保持了清醒的头脑和历史责任感。
    在不同的历史时期，党风问题所包含的具体内容不是完全相同的，党风建设所要解决的问题也不会完全相同。延安时期，党集中反对主观主义、宗派主义和党八股。解放初期，党强调反对脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义和主观主义，以及骄傲自满。今天，党要求继承发扬一系列优良作风，消除党内的消极、腐败现象。但是，党风建设的根本任务和目标始终是一致的，这就是保持党的先进性质和宗旨，防止脱离人民群众。在改革开放的新形势下，这一点更为突出。从实际情况看，以权谋私，对党和人民事业不负责任、不倾听群众意见、不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义和奢侈浪费等不正之风，一直是党所致力纠正的，其最大的危险，就是脱离群众。
    对于工人阶级政党执政后脱离群众的危险，马克思、列宁和我们党的领袖历来都十分重视，说明这是执政党建设中的一个重大问题。历史经验反复证明，错误和挫折的发生，问题往往主要出在党内。在新的形势下，党内脱离群众的消极、腐败现象的存在，是危害党的肌体、威胁党的生命的一大隐患。邓小平同志针对前不久的政治风波指出，不惩治腐败，特别是党内的，确实有失败的危险。我们总结过去，考虑未来，要认识到党是在同人民群众的密切联系中产生、发展、壮大起来的。没有广大人民群众的支持，党一天也不能生存下去。党执政以后，脱离群众的危险增大了，全党同志都应把这个问题同党的命运联系起来，站在这样的高度，认识搞好党风、开展反对腐败斗争的重要性和紧迫性，坚定不移地继承和发扬党的优良传统和作风，坚持不懈地纠正各种不正之风和腐败现象，永远植根于群众之中，恢复和发展党与人民群众的血肉联系。这样，我们党就一定能够经得起任何风浪的考验，永远立于不败之地。
    要正确处理党风建设与廉政工作的关系
    党风建设和廉政工作对于党的建设和政权建设都是至关重要的。正确认识和处理这二者之间的关系，是当前亟待解决的一个重要问题。一个时期以来，党风建设被淡化和削弱，致使党内不正之风和腐败现象的滋生蔓延日趋严重，动摇了党内外广大干部群众同腐败现象作斗争的信心，廉政工作也难以有效开展。
    廉洁是对从政人员的一种行为规范，即要求在金钱和物质面前做到不受贿、不贪污。古人言：“不受曰廉，不污曰洁”。为政清廉，不独是今天对干部的要求，就是在我国的古代也讲“废贪而立廉”；不独是我们对干部的要求，国外的一些地方也在倡导和实行廉政。　当然，在封建社会和资本主义社会，统治阶级为其阶级本性所决定，是不可能真正做到的。“三年清知府，十万雪花银”，正是对封建官僚鱼肉百姓的真实写照。我们社会主义国家的政府，是为人民服务的，其性质、宗旨决定了我们必须实行廉洁政治。只有在工人阶级政党领导下的人民政权，才能建设真正的廉洁政府。事实也说明，我们的绝大多数干部，在各条战线、各个工作岗位上是勤奋工作，艰苦奋斗，清正廉洁，公而忘私的。廉政工作是我们人民民主专政政权建设的一项重要内容，它的根本任务和目标，就是永远保持国家工作人员人民勤务员的公仆本色。
    党风是党组织和党员在思想、政治、工作、学习、生活诸方面的一贯态度和行为，是党的性质和世界观在党组织和党员行动上的表现。党风建设包括继承和发扬党的优良作风和纠正不正之风两个方面的内容。党的优良作风是在同不正之风斗争中形成和发展起来的。中国共产党在长期革命和建设的实践中形成了理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评和自我批评，以及自力更生、艰苦奋斗等独具特色的优良作风，它反映了我们党最基本的政治特征。我们党是工人阶级的先锋队，党员是工人阶级的先进分子。党风建设的根本任务，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装全党，使全体共产党员永远保持工人阶级先锋队的政治本色和精神风貌。
    党风建设和廉政工作既有联系，又有区别，不能只讲联系，不讲区别，也不能只讲区别，不讲联系。廉政工作所要解决的一些问题，也是纠正党内不正之风工作的重要内容。我们是执政党，大量党员干部在国家机关工作。政府机关工作人员中，共产党员占60％多，县级以上领导干部中，共产党员占90％多。党员和国家工作人员的双重身份于一体，既要求坚持党员标准，又要求遵循国家干部的行为规范。共产党员的廉洁与否，直接决定着国家政权机关的廉洁程度，而国家政权机关廉政工作的好坏，同样关系到党在群众中的形象和威望。因此，党风建设和廉政工作不能截然分开，互为代替，而要相互促进。正在进行的廉政工作，对于消除政府中的某些消极腐败现象，缓和群众的某些不满情绪，推进政权建设和党的作风建设，起到了积极的作用，应当继续抓好。但不能因此就忽视乃至丢掉党风建设。党风建设关系到用什么样的标准要求我们的党员，按照什么样的思想建设党。中国共产党是保持中国长治久安的决定力量，是领导各族人民建设有中国特色社会主义的坚强核心。搞好党的作风建设，具有全局性和决定性的意义。邓小平同志指出：“要坚持党的领导，必须改善党的领导，改进党的作风。”可见，搞好党风建设是坚持党的领导的重要措施。加强党风建设要求共产党员必须按照党纲党章规范自己的言论和行动，具有坚定的共产主义信念，牢记全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，继承和发扬党的优良传统和作风，保持共产党人的高尚品德和情操，而不是仅仅停留在洁身自好、不贪不占上。这就是说，党风建设比廉政工作起点要高，内容更为丰富、广泛，对于共产党员的要求更为严格。一个党员干部，必须具备廉洁这一起码的条件。同时，还必须时刻保持党的先进性。这正是共产党人与清官、廉吏的区别所在。
    党风建设在政风和社会风气建设中起着核心主导作用，党风建设搞好了，就会带动政风和社会风气，解决为政不廉的问题就有了坚实的基础。毛泽东同志曾指出：“只要我们党的作风完全正派了，全国人民就会跟我们学。党外有这种不良风气的人，只要他们是善良的，就会跟我们学，改正他们的错误，这样就会影响全民族。”可见，搞好党风，是搞好政风和社会风气的关键。十三届四中全会以后，以江泽民同志为核心的新的中央领导，坚持物质文明建设和精神文明建设一齐抓的战略方针，大力加强党的思想、作风、组织、制度建设，带领全党、全国人民坚决而扎实、稳妥地开展了反对腐败的斗争。前不久，党中央、国务院决定，要做七件群众关心的事，体现了从中央做起的发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，有的已见成效，有的正在认真实施中，振奋了党心民心。当前，党风建设的势头很好，我们应当紧紧围绕党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，继续贯彻一要坚决，二要持久的方针，把党风建设扎扎实实地抓下去，用好的党风保证五中全会提出的进一步治理整顿和深化改革目标的顺利实现，保证党的各项工作的深入进行。要坚持领导干部、领导机关带头，从自己做起，层层做表率；要坚持以搞好党风带动政风和社会风气，相互促进，综合治理；要坚持在提高党员的政治素质上下功夫，把思想教育、严肃执纪和制度建设密切结合起来；要坚持全党抓党风，领导亲自动手，建立和落实责任制；要坚持依靠群众，把消除腐败现象和纠正不良风气建立在坚实的人民群众的基础之上。可以相信，经过全党的不懈努力，一定能够在改革开放中搞好党风建设，充分发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和共产党员的先锋模范作用，树立党的崇高形象。
    搞好党风要重视提高党员的政治素质
    我们党有4800多万党员，他们能否坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想，坚定共产主义信念，能否真正做到全心全意为人民服务，决定了整个党的精神风貌，关系到党风建设的成败。对党员个人来说，党风问题归根到底是个世界观问题，是个党性问题。党风是党性的外在表现，党员政治素质的高与低，对其思想作风、工作作风状况，有着决定性的影响。明确这一点，对树立和坚持党风建设的正确指导思想是非常重要的。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是我们党的行动指南。用马列主义、毛泽东思想武装全党同志的头脑，不断提高党员的政治素质，是搞好党风建设的思想基础。延安整风，实际上是一场马克思主义的教育运动。以毛泽东同志为核心的党中央着重抓了全党马克思主义水平、基本政治素质的提高，从而有效地开展了反对主观主义、宗派主义和党八股等不良风气的斗争，为打败日本侵略者、夺取新民主主义革命的胜利做了思想和理论上的准备。党的十一届三中全会以来，邓小平同志、陈云同志等老一辈无产阶级革命家曾多次强调全党要学习马克思主义基本理论，提高政治素质和辨别是非的能力。全党在这方面也做了不少工作，使党的理论联系实际，运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的立场、观点、方法分析和解决问题的能力，有了较大的提高。但与此同时，也不能不看到，在改革开放新的形势下，有相当数量的党组织忽视政治理论的学习，放松了党员政治素质的提高。毛泽东同志早就指出的一些同志组织上入了党，思想上没有入党或没有完全入党的状况，在今天仍然存在。党员政治素质上存在的问题，严重损害了党的思想作风。一些党员政治理论基础不牢靠，政治立场不坚定，对党的路线、方针、政策理解得很肤浅，采取实用主义的态度，政治上左右摇摆，甚至有的在党和国家生死存亡的紧急关头，迷失了方向，站到了党的对立面，给党造成了极坏的影响；一部分党员丢掉了共产主义理想和全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，个人主义、贪图享乐等非无产阶级思想恶性膨胀，在金钱物质的腐蚀面前败下阵来。党内以权谋私、奢侈浪费等不正之风和严重不负责任的官僚主义蔓延发展，在某些地方和部门甚至愈演愈烈。邓小平同志深刻指出，十年来最大的失误是教育，主要是思想政治教育。实践证明，党内也是如此。要搞好党风建设，就要重视提高党员的政治素质。
    近些年来，全党上下加快了制度建设的步伐，使党的各方面的工作进一步纳入了规范化、制度化的轨道，促进了党的各项建设。但是，有的同志在抓制度建设中，又忽视和丢掉了思想教育，削弱了党风建设。思想教育和制度建设都是加强党风建设的基本措施，应当把二者有机地统一起来，相互促进，相得益彰。片面强调哪一个方面，都会事与愿违，达不到预期的目的。要认真总结经验教训，在各项工作中，在任何时候、任何情况下，都应当注重思想教育。制度建设有一个逐步发展、完善的过程，不可能一蹴而就；制度本身也要靠人去制定，去执行。以什么样的指导思想、态度对待制度的制定和实施，其社会效果自然是大不相同的。离开思想教育，制度建设本身也不可能真正搞好。夸大思想教育的功能，忽视制度对于规范人的行为的重要作用，实践已证明是行不通的。同样，把一切寄希望于制度上，以为有了制度就万事大吉了，也是片面的。其结果往往是制度建设没搞好，思想教育又丢掉了，反而加剧了党内外的不正之风和腐败现象的蔓延。思想教育是党的优良传统，重视其在党风建设中的作用，实质是发挥作为党风建设基本力量的全体党员和各级党组织的积极性和创造性，为制度建设、严肃执纪等工作奠定思想基础，它同制度建设是完全一致的。
    坚持党性、党风、党纪教育，是提高党员政治素质的中心环节。在整个社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的过程中，全党同志都应当在改造客观世界的同时努力改造主观世界，牢固树立马克思主义世界观、方法论，不断增强党性。当前，要注重教育党员牢记共产主义的远大理想和目标，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，坚决反对形形色色的攻击、诋毁党的领导和社会主义制度的错误思潮，在各种复杂的矛盾和问题面前，始终一贯地保持清醒的头脑，坚持正确的政治方向。要教育党员牢记全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，甘当公仆，廉洁奉公，始终把人民利益作为自己言行的根本出发点和归宿，自觉抵制剥削阶级思想的侵蚀，抵制各种物质利益的诱惑，树立公而忘私的精神，绝不以权谋私。要教育党员增强组织纪律观念，坚持民主集中制原则，做到在任何情况下都能正确处理国家、集体、个人三者利益的关系，以党和人民的利益为重，在言论和行动上，自觉地同党的路线、方针、政策保持一致。要教育党员永远保持艰苦奋斗的革命本色，吃苦在前，享受在后，与群众同甘共苦，带头过紧日子，坚决反对奢侈浪费和在生活待遇上搞特殊化等不良风气，始终与群众保持血肉的联系。
    我们党是由千百万忠诚于共产主义事业的先进分子所组成的，他们英勇奋斗、艰苦创业的精神风貌曾经感召了浩浩荡荡的人民群众大军，跟随党推翻旧制度，建设新中国。一支具有高度政治觉悟、密切联系群众的党员队伍，是党的力量所在，也是党的优良作风得以保持和发扬的关键所在。只要全党在新的历史条件下努力提高政治素质，并从多方面抓紧工作，就能够把包括党风建设在内的党的各项工作提高到一个新的水平。
