    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 7
    Two major Shiite Muslim militias in Lebanon clashed today in the "Green Line" and western districts of Beirut, injuring seven people.

    According to the police, the fighting was between the Syrian-backed Amal Movement and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah. The conflict was triggered by a dispute between individuals from the two factions. The fighting began in the morning and continued until evening, with both sides using light and heavy machine guns and rocket launchers.

    Two days ago, the Amal Movement and Hezbollah had a battle in the Bekaa Valley, resulting in nearly 60 casualties.

    The armed conflict between the Amal Movement and Hezbollah began in May 1987, with the aim of controlling Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Muslims. According to police statistics, 552 people have been killed and 1,532 injured in various clashes between the two factions.

    黎真主党与阿迈勒运动激战
    新华社贝鲁特12月7日电  黎巴嫩什叶派穆斯林两大民兵组织今天在贝鲁特“绿线”至西区一带发生激烈战斗，7人被打伤。
    据警方说，战斗是在叙利亚支持的阿迈勒运动和亲伊朗的真主党之间进行的。冲突的原因是这两派中的个别人同对方发生了争执。战斗从上午开始，双方使用了轻重机枪和火箭弹，直到晚上战事才趋平静。
    两天前，阿迈勒运动组织和真主党曾在贝卡谷地发生战斗，结果造成近60人伤亡。
    阿迈勒运动和真主党之间的武装冲突始于1987年5月，目的是为了争取控制黎巴嫩国内120万什叶派穆斯林。据警方统计，在两派各次冲突中已有552人死亡，1532人受伤。
    新华社贝鲁特12月8日电  黎巴嫩穆斯林阿迈勒运动和真主党两派民兵之间的武装冲突今天进入第2天。双方在叙利亚军队控制的西贝鲁特展开了巷战，战斗愈打愈烈。
    安全人士说，已有6人死亡，18人受伤。叙利亚驻军已命令双方停火，有谁违抗，格杀勿论。但是，整个西贝鲁特仍旧枪炮声一片。学校、商店全都关闭。居民们全被赶到了地下防空洞。
