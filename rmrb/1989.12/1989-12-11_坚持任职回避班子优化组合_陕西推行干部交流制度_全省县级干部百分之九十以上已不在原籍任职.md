The Communist Party of Shaanxi Province has been paying attention to maintaining the relative stability of leadership teams at all levels, while gradually improving and perfecting the system of exchanging and rotating Party and government leaders. This aims to enhance the overall structure of leadership teams, increase the wisdom of cadres, and promote clean governance.

It is reported that over the past year, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee has exchanged and rotated 287 leading cadres at the prefecture, bureau, county, and city levels. Through these exchanges, more than 90% of county-level Party and government leaders are no longer serving in their home counties. Out of the 214 county (city, district) Party secretaries and county (city, district) mayors, 210 are not serving in their home counties. Practice has shown that implementing the regular exchange and rotation of leading cadres helps in fostering a diverse and inclusive leadership, breaking down "relationship networks," and preventing "inbreeding" within leadership teams. It also helps in carrying forward the Party's fine traditions and working together for the common good.

In the process of exchanging cadres, the Provincial Party Committee first implemented the principle of position avoidance. First, it clearly defined the scope and range of cadre exchanges and rotations, stipulating that prefecture, bureau, city (county) level leaders and the heads of prefecture, city (county) disciplinary inspection commissions, organization departments, intermediate courts, procuratorates, personnel bureaus, public security bureaus, and supervision bureaus should all be exchanged within the provincial scope; other exchange objects generally within the city or county scope. Second, it combined cadre exchanges with the implementation of relative avoidance and position avoidance, stipulating that local cadres in county-level Party and government teams should not exceed 1/4, and that cadres with "two generations and three relatives" relationships in the same leadership team should be exchanged to avoid relatives, with individual cases, for work reasons, that are not suitable for avoidance, to be reported to higher authorities for review and approval. Third, it stipulated the time limit for exchanges: elected leading cadres generally undergo exchanges after serving two terms, while non-elected cadres generally undergo exchanges after serving in the same position for 10 years; those elected to county-level Party and government leadership positions in their home counties should undergo exchanges after completing one term.

While implementing relative avoidance and position avoidance, the Provincial Party Committee also focuses on optimizing the composition of prefecture, bureau, county, and city leadership teams to improve the overall quality of the leadership teams.

For the personal and family difficulties of the exchanged cadres, the organization tries its best to help solve them. If they cannot be solved immediately, the situation will be explained to the cadres, so that they can happily take up their new positions. For those who do not obey organizational arrangements and do not change after criticism and education, disciplinary actions will be taken, including demotion or removal from office.

    坚持任职回避班子优化组合
    陕西推行干部交流制度
    全省县级干部百分之九十以上已不在原籍任职
    本报西安电　记者孟西安报道：中共陕西省委在注意各级领导班子相对稳定的前提下，逐步健全完善党政领导干部交流轮换制度，改善领导班子的整体结构，以增长干部的聪明才智，促进领导者廉洁从政。
    据悉，去年以来，陕西省委管理的地、厅、县、市级正副职领导干部共交流轮换287人。经过交流，全省县级党政正副职领导干部中，90％以上已不在原籍任职，全省214名县（市、区）委书记、县（市、区）长中有210名已不在原籍任职。实践证明，实行领导干部定期交流轮换，有助于搞“五湖四海”，打破“关系网”，防止领导班子的“近亲繁殖”，有助于发扬党的优良作风，同心同德做好工作。
    在领导干部交流工作中，省委首先推行了任职回避。一是明确干部交流轮换的对象和范围，规定地、厅、市
  （县）级正副职和地、市（县）纪委、组织部、中级法院、检察院、人事局、公安局、监察局的正职领导干部，均在全省范围内交流；其他交流对象一般在本地、市范围内交流；二是注意把干部交流与实行亲属回避、任职回避结合起来，规定县级党政班子中本地干部不能超过1／4，凡有“两系三代”亲属关系在同一领导班子任职的干部，要实行亲属回避交流，个别从工作出发，不宜回避的，要报上级审查批准；三是规定了交流的时限：选举产生的领导干部，一般连任两届后进行交流，非选举产生的干部，一般在同一单位连任职务10年后即进行交流；经选举担任县级党政领导职务的本县人，在任期满一届后即进行交流。
    在实行任职回避，亲属回避的同时，省委还注重地、厅、县、市领导班子的优化组合，提高领导班子的整体素质。
    对被交流干部个人和家庭的实际困难，组织上尽可能帮助解决，一时解决不了的，将情况向本人讲清楚，使他们心情舒畅地走上新的工作岗位。对于个别不服从组织分配、经批评教育不改的，要执行纪律，予以降职、免职。
