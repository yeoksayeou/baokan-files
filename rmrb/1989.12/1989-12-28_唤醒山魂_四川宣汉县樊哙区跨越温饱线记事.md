On June 27, 1988, Yang Rudi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, visited Xuanhan County in northeastern Sichuan. He showed great concern for Fenghuo District in the northeastern corner of the county. After listening to the county's report, he said, "Fenghuo is the poorest and is a key area known throughout the province. Solving the problem of the people's basic needs there would be very convincing."

A year passed, and when the People's Republic of China modestly celebrated her 40th birthday, the news from there was so heartening: the district's per capita grain possession was 400 kilograms, and the per capita net income was 301 yuan. More than 80% of the total population, who were impoverished households, finally crossed that glorious yet somewhat humiliating "poverty" line.

All of this came so quietly, that no one felt even a slight tremor;
All of this came so slowly, the sleeping spirit of the mountains had endured countless generations of longing and despair...

The Silent Mountains

(1) Unfolding a 1:6,500,000 map of China, you will find that Xuanhan County, with 4,200 square kilometers of land, has only two marked points: one is the county seat "Xuanhan," and the other is "Fenghuo."

In ancient times, Emperor Gaozu of Han sent General Fan Kuai to store grain here. From here, he marched to Ba and Qin, captured cities, and roamed the Central Plains, how magnificent! Perhaps he took away the spirit of the mountains, leaving only the name "Fenghuo" and the thousand-year-old silence and desolation. Fenghuo was favored by the cartographers, perhaps because of its ancient history, or because of the poverty that has been passed down through generations?

(2) In 1975, Fenghuo was connected by road. The people of Fenghuo joyfully welcomed the first bus to the district seat. After the celebration, they woke up from their dream: the so-called opening ceremony was merely a celebration of the resolution of the "transportation difficulty" for a production team in a village in a township. To this day, out of the 8 townships in the district, 6 still do not have roads.

From the district seat to the ferry, Longquan, Ziyou, and Jichang townships, over 100 kilometers of narrow mountain roads are filled with names like "Snake Retreat," "Ghost's Dread," "South Heaven Gate," and "Iron Gate Ridge," which send shivers down one's spine. People have been climbing these roads like monkeys for years, and one false step would send them plummeting into the abyss. In 1983, with government subsidies and labor contributions from the people, they built plank roads on these cliffs. Eight mountain people were buried in the valley by the sound of the blasting. They did not get to see their beloved mountains and rivers one last time before they hurriedly left, and to this day, their remains are nowhere to be found.

(3) This is a picture of such bitter survival: 55,000 mountain people toil in the depths of the Daba Mountains, at an altitude of over 800 meters, with 80% mountainous terrain and a minimum slope of 30.8 degrees, in an area of 555 square kilometers. Everyone is struggling for survival, and warmth and fullness, the most basic conditions for living, have become their highest aspirations. Hunger and cold cling to everyone's life like demons.

Located at the junction of four counties—Wanyuan, Chengkou, Kaizhou, and Xuanhan—the townships of Jichang, Longquan, and Ziyou have not a single inch of paddy fields. Due to their similar natural conditions, they form a contiguous poverty-stricken area of 100 miles. Most people here live almost like primitive people. They drink "sour gruel" (because the temperature is low and corn cannot ripen, the locals grind it into a thin porridge, put it in a jar, and make do for half a year), sleep in "corn husk beds" (they dry the peeled corn husks and pile them in the corner of the house, and the whole family huddles in them to sleep and keep warm), and 1,460 households live in caves. This contrasts starkly with the natural scenery of the 100-mile gorge, which is not inferior to the Three Gorges.

In 1983, the spring breeze of rural reforms had blown across the country. However, when the 9th team of Pingxi Village in Ziyou Township implemented the household contract responsibility system, the collective property consisted of only a stone weight for a scale, a broken abacus with only three beads left, and half a sow shared with a private owner.

At the end of 1983, while people were enjoying the fashion show on television, the 1,900 impoverished individuals in Jichang Township were waiting for donated clothes to get through the long winter.

Since 1983, the county has implemented a special birth control policy for Jichang, Ziyou, and Longquan townships, but the natural population growth rate has been negative for three consecutive years...

Poverty, you are cursed and yet impossible to escape, how cruelly you cripple the wings of eagles, how mercilessly you threaten human survival!

The spirit of the mountains is dormant, the mountains are silent, and 500,000 mu of land is weeping silently...

Love in the Depths of the Mountains

(1) In May 1984, the newly appointed county party secretary, Du Ziming, set out into the mountains with a backpack of dry rations. He was the second county party secretary to enter the 100-mile gorge area since liberation.

During a week of investigation, Du Ziming's heart grew heavier with each step. Yes, 35 years had passed since liberation, but the scenes that should not have existed were so heart-wrenching. From the eyes of the young woman hiding behind the door because her clothes were too tattered to cover her shame, from the eyes of the old man who walked for two days to see the "parental official," from the eyes of the child who respectfully handed over roasted sweet potatoes, he saw the tears of hope that were being held back.

In the first group of Chuanshi Village, Longquan Township, the family of Wang Yuancheng, three people in tattered clothes, lived in a "buried fork" house (a simple shed) made of tree branches and corn stalks. When the secretary climbed onto the "loft" made of rough wooden sticks, the entire shed swayed.

He entered Wang Yuanxiao's home, where the family of three was huddled in a crescent-shaped cave. The only wooden box used to store grain was empty, and the cave wall had a pile of corn husks for sleeping; the stove had just cooked wild potatoes and vegetables. He also learned that Wang Yuanxiao had a 12-year-old daughter who could not bear the hunger and ran away to another township.

He wanted to cry, but no tears came out.

(2) When the county party secretary announced at a full county cadre meeting that Xuanhan County had been listed as a "national key poverty-stricken mountainous county," the entire hall was silent, and everyone bowed their heads.

With a population accounting for 5% of the county's total and impoverished households accounting for 14.2% of the county's total, Fenghuo District naturally became the focus of attention.

People were thinking: Where is the hope for Fenghuo?

Should we relocate the villagers on a large scale? That's easier said than done! Mountain people have nothing but a kind of inherited pride: they cannot be made to move. That would be the most shameful thing. In 1985, the county coordinated the relocation of 18 households, but soon 6 households quietly returned, saying: Without the mountains, they could not live.

Moreover, where would there be enough capacity to absorb so many people? It seems that the only way is to work on the mountain.

What is the root cause of poverty? Du Ziming went into the mountains again to find the answer. He discovered that socialism's superiority here was only the simplest annotation: the tens of millions of yuan and hundreds of millions of jin of grain that the state subsidizes every year, people eat with a clear conscience, after all, the Communist Party will not let people starve or freeze to death. Year after year of subsidies did not save them from poverty, but instead fostered their complacency with poverty, stifling their will to fight against poverty.

This damned complacency!

(3) In early spring of 1985, 50 students and teachers from the Fine Arts College in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, came to the 100-mile gorge for sketching and practice. The mountains and rivers here intoxicated these artistic elites, and the farming system's destruction of nature made them sigh.

Every sowing season, people would burn a patch of mountain bare, cut down tree stumps, dig out tree roots, sow seeds, and wait for the harvest. The next year, they would go burn another patch of mountain. To survive today, they had to cruelly destroy the conditions they would rely on tomorrow for survival. No wonder the tragedy kept playing out here year after year, and no wonder the days of ending "relying on returns for grain and relying on subsidies for money" were still so far away.

Facing the cruel reality, the county party committee and government resolutely decided: Fenghuo District would stop farming and restore 35,000 mu of steep slopes unsuitable for farming to forests and pastures, and the grain for impoverished households would be supplied by the state quota.

But supplying grain requires money. Where would the money come from?

(4) Experts came; livestock experts came; forestry experts came; the county's science and technology deputy township heads came; and the responsible comrades from the county-level poverty alleviation units also came.

They came together for a "consultation." They wanted to prescribe a "medicine" for this land that had lost too much blood.

After repeated discussions, they decided on two legs to walk: focus on economic forestry production and develop livestock production with grass-eating livestock as the backbone to earn money to buy rice and clothes.

Thus, the district committee launched a great discussion throughout the district on whether to rely on relief or rely on oneself to get rid of poverty.

Thus, the first batch of seedlings bought with poverty alleviation funds was distributed.

Thus, the first batch of livestock bought with financial turnover funds was distributed.

People who had almost lost the ability to fight against poverty by relying on the state now had to throw away their crutches and find the magic wand to stand on their own.

(5) Recently, Wu Xiaochen, who was evaluated as a "national outstanding party worker," took over the position of district party secretary in the spring of 1987 and immediately delved into the depths of the mountains. Every household in the 8 townships of the district left footprints. In the Daba Mountains, where "you can talk face to face, but it takes a day to meet," what does this signify for a weak body with a 12-centimeter stomach prolapse?

A question kept lingering in his mind: The state supplies us with 2 million jin of grain every year, transported from various parts of the county to Fenghuo Shop by trucks, and then sent to various townships by small wooden boats against the current of the Qian River. Every year, hundreds of millions of yuan are subsidized for transportation and grain price differences. This is a heavy burden for a mountainous county with a fiscal deficit year after year! From the farmers' perspective, those who live far away have to spend two or three days each time to buy grain, and the mountain roads are treacherous, and they can only carry 30 to 40 jin each time. Tofu is priced like meat.

Wu Xiaochen was looking for a breakthrough in grain self-sufficiency.

Two months later, a plan for Fenghuo District to achieve grain self-sufficiency was presented to the county party committee members.

That year, Wu Xiaochen personally oversaw the 3 demonstration points for plastic film-covered corn, which achieved unexpected success: at an altitude of 1,900 meters in Laohuangshan, 1,600 meters in Xiaoping Village, and 1,000 meters in Jichangping, the average yield per mu was 320 jin, 350 jin, and 400 jin respectively, which was more than five times higher than the conventional varieties grown in the open field.

The high-cold climate that had been unchanged for thousands of years was tamed under a layer of magical film.

(6) The county party committee and government discovered a glimmer of dawn in the depths of the mountains.

In 1988, a "white revolution" was launched in the Fenghuo mountain area. However, in a region where 60% are illiterate, the promotion of a relatively simple technology was so arduous.

During the day, meetings were held to mobilize, and the plastic film bought with unified loans was distributed to each household. At night, some people quietly returned it to the village and community cadres.

Hundreds of cadres and technicians provided on-site guidance, but still, 30% did not meet the planting requirements.

Farmers who had eaten returned grain demanded that the state guarantee the grain supply as a condition for planting plastic film-covered corn...

From pre-reserved rows to management, the county party secretary entered the 100-mile gorge 5 times in 3 months; the agricultural technician from the county agricultural bureau broke his waist in the mountains; the supply and transportation departments timely organized the transportation of high-quality fertilizers.

Farmers who did not believe that a thin layer of paper could grow crops planted 12,000 mu of plastic film-covered corn, albeit not very regularly.

After the harvest, the average yield per mu was 306.5 jin, with the highest exceeding 500 jin. 60% of the impoverished households achieved grain self-sufficiency for the first time. The supply of relief grain was reduced to 420,000 jin.

Poverty and hunger pushed these Fenghuo people onto the battlefield of the "white revolution," and once they tasted the fruit of success, they pushed history forward.

The Rising Ridge

After countless calls, the spirit of the mountains finally awoke. When it slowly opened its eyes, it was surprised to find that within its embrace, a ridge after another stood tall.

A large number of Communist Party members, Young Pioneers, women, and ordinary people changed the objective world while also changing their subjective world. They are the backbone that makes the mountains stand tall.

(1) Ning Shunan, 34, returned to his hometown after graduating from high school and has been a private school teacher for 15 years. When he stepped into a small thatched hut on the 2,300-meter-high Longtang Mountain in Jichang Township on a snowy day, he could not believe his eyes: a few long wooden planks, a rotten blackboard, and 5 children made up a sacred world—a school.

He began to cultivate for his hometown's future and declared war on ignorance and illiteracy.

Two years later, he made the school completely free through diligent work and study, and the enrollment rate and retention rate both reached 100%.

In September 1984, Ning Shunan was transferred to Maoping Village Primary School and quickly reversed the situation where 60% of the students had dropped out.

Last September, he was transferred to Chaoyan Primary School in Fanshan Village. He mobilized the masses to contribute labor and funds, making the school buildings of this 20-year-old school look new.

When he used his meager salary to treat students' illnesses, when he was the first to donate money to repair the school, when he cut students' hair for free year after year, when he stayed up all night under the kerosene lamp... he felt like a willow tree in the Daba Mountains, and modern civilization sprouted bud after bud in his heart.

In 1989, he was rated as a "national labor model in the education system," which was a high honor for him.

(2) In March 1986, Li Chengliang and Zhou Chuanxing had an unusual month. These two classmates from middle school reunited on the land of their hometown. One was as the township party committee secretary, and the other as the township head. They were to build together the land of Ziyou Township that they had been thinking about day and night.

Soon after taking office, a report was placed on their desk: 2 villages and 7 teams in Taohua applied to contract and develop a forest and medicinal herb farm.

Who is Taohua? An ordinary young farmer with only a junior high school education. A family of 7, due to the extremely harsh natural conditions, the township proposed to relocate the entire family to live down the mountain. He secretly "scouted" ahead and, by some strange fate, had this idea, so he boldly came to seek help.

This was a novel thing in the mountains. Simply planting trees would not see immediate benefits, but planting medicinal herbs could see results quickly. This was a direction.

The township immediately approved Taohua's application and gave a loan of 5,000 yuan as a down payment.

In April, Taohua led 10 people to march into the barren mountains and slopes. In less than two years, they built a 2,300-mu forest and medicinal herb farm. The team quickly grew to 30 people, with an annual per capita income of nearly 800 yuan.

Now, Taohua is leading a team to the highest place in the township, Lingguan Temple, to open up a new battlefield. The seeds they sowed blossomed and bore fruit throughout the township and even the entire 100-mile gorge area. The district now has 44 such large-scale forest and medicinal herb tea specialty farms.

(3) In the autumn of 1988, in the 100-mile gorge area surrounded by steep cliffs, the sound of car horns echoed for the first time. Originally, the people of Longquan and Ziyou townships, with the support of the state and their own efforts, built 3.5 kilometers of dead-end roads in both directions. People lifted the cars onto wooden boats, floated them up the river, and then pulled them onto the road with ropes. The mountain people, layer upon layer, welcomed the arrival of the messenger of civilization. Although the road was still difficult, they believed that the days of changing the transportation difficulties would not be far away.

Now, the road from Fenghuo to Duku has been completed; the Fenghuo Bridge and the road from Fenghuo to Sandun are under construction; the single-lane road from Duku Township to Longquan, Jichang, and Ziyou townships has been included in the poverty alleviation and development agenda.

The mountains here are turning green, and the forest coverage rate has increased from 25% in 1984 to 45% this year; 1.72 million lacquer trees, 2.02 million "three woods" (thick bark, Eucommia, and yellow bark) medicinal materials, 750,000 fruit trees, 87,000 mu of rare medicinal materials such as Chinese goldthread and Gastrodia, 73,680 mu of tea leaves, 40,000 mu of tobacco leaves, and other economic crops, and 25,000 goats, 9,000 cows, 15,000 rabbits, and 67,000 pigs, show the broad prospects of Fenghuo District.

A civil affairs cadre who had worked in the 100-mile gorge area 31 years ago recently revisited the area and was deeply moved: "In the past, 200 households in Jichangping and Maoping had only 3 households with tiled houses, but now every household has built new tiled houses, which is truly amazing!"

Those who used to only keep company with the moon, stars, and poverty now express strong curiosity about the outside world through radios;

Those who initially returned the plastic film to the village and community cadres, those who only planted plastic film-covered corn with state money, for the first time tasted the fruits of their own labor and showed great initiative in planting plastic film-covered corn;

Those who were illiterate for generations now also understand the importance of sending their children to school. The enrollment rate of school-age children in the district reached 93.3%, and the retention rate of students in school reached 92.1%.

The life of fighting against poverty brought the people of Fenghuo into a new world. As they move towards prosperity, they also chase after hope. As they pursue material changes, they also pursue a change in their spiritual appearance.

The mountains are no longer silent; they have raised high the banner of self-improvement and struggle!

    唤醒山魂
    ——四川宣汉县樊哙区跨越温饱线记事
    严洪波
    1988年6月27日，中共中央政治局委员、四川省委书记杨汝岱来到川东北的宣汉县，对该县东北角的樊哙区表示了极大的关注。听完县上的汇报，他说：“樊哙最穷，是个重点，全省都有名。把那里群众的温饱问题解决了，是很有说服力的。”
    一年过去了，当人民共和国俭朴地度过她40岁生日的时候，这里传出的消息是那么振奋人心：全区人均占有粮食400公斤、人均纯收入301元，占总人口80％以上的贫困户终于全部越过了那条光荣而又略带羞辱的“温饱”线。
    这一切来得太悄然了，竟没有谁曾感觉到一丝足音的颤动；
    这一切来得太迟缓了，沉睡的山魂不知经受了多少世代的翘盼和绝望……
    大山不语
    （1）展开650万分之一的中国地图，你就会发现，拥有4200平方公里土地的宣汉县，只标注了两点：一点是县城“宣汉”，另一点就是“樊哙”。
    想当年，汉高祖刘邦派大将樊哙将军在此囤粮，从这里出兵巴秦，攻城略地，驰骋中原，好不威风！或许是他带走了大山的灵气罢，除了留下一个“樊哙”的地名外，剩下的只是千年如斯的沉寂与荒凉。樊哙能得到制图者们如此的青睐，不知是因为它那久远的历史，还是因为那里世代因袭的贫困？
    （2）1975年樊哙通车了，樊哙人兴高彩烈地迎来开往区所在地的第一辆汽车。狂欢之后，他们才如梦初醒：所谓通车典礼，只不过是庆贺区所在地的一个乡的一个生产队解决了“运输难”。时至今日，全区8个乡仍然有6个乡未通公路。
    从区上到渡口、龙泉、自由、鸡唱四个乡的100多公里羊肠小道，布满了“蛇倒退”、“鬼见愁”、“南天门”、“铁门坎”等一长串令人毛骨悚然的地名，人们常年像猴子一样攀援其上，一脚不慎，便会坠入深渊。1983年，由政府补助，群众投入劳动日，在那些悬崖上修凿栈道，有8位山民在开山的炮声中葬身谷底。他们没来得及最后看一眼生养他们的这山这水，就匆匆地离去了，至今尸骨无觅处。
    （3）这是一幅多么辛酸的生存图：5.5万山民们在海拔800米以上、山地占了80％、最低坡度30.8度的555平方公里的大巴山深处辛勤劳作，人人都在为生而苦苦挣扎，温与饱这两个最基本的生存条件成了他们最高的奢望，饥饿和寒冷像恶魔一样附缠着每个人的一生。
    地处万源、城口、开县、宣汉四县交界处的鸡唱、龙泉、自由三乡没有一寸稻田。因其自然条件相似，形成了连片的百里峡贫困地区。这里的大多数人几乎像原始人一般生活着。喝的叫
  “酸浆子”（因气温低玉米不能成熟，当地人就把它磨成稀浆，盛在缸子里，凑合过大半年），睡的叫“冲壳子”（将剥下的玉米壳晒干堆在屋角，一家人钻在里面睡觉取暖），还有1460多户栖身岩洞。这与不是三峡胜似三峡的百里峡自然风光形成了多么强烈的反差。
    1983年，农村改革的春风已吹遍大江南北。而自由乡坪溪村9队在实行家庭联产承包责任制时，集体财产只有一杆石头作秤砣的秤、一把仅剩三档的破算盘和与私人合喂的半头母猪；
    1983年岁末，当人们围在电视机旁欣赏时装大赛的时候，鸡唱乡1900多贫困对象却在等着外面捐献的衣物去度过漫长的寒冬；
    1983年以来，县上对鸡唱、自由、龙泉三乡实行特殊的生育政策，可是连续3年人口自然增长率都是负数……
    贫困，你这令人诅咒又让人无力摆脱的贫困啊，多么残忍地摧残着雄鹰的翅膀，多么无情地威胁着人类的延续！
    山魂沉睡，大山不语，500多平方公里的土地在默默地哭泣……
    情漫深山
    （1） 1984年5月，新上任的县委书记杜自明一行身背干粮进山了，他是解放后10任县委书记中第二个深入百里峡地区的人。
    在一周的调查中，杜自明每到一处，心里就增加一分沉重。是啊，解放35年了，不该有的情景却是那么惨不忍睹。从那躲在门后因穿着不能遮羞的衣衫而不敢见人的大姑娘的眼中，从那走了两天山路特意来看一眼“父母官”的老人的眼中，从那用尊敬的双手递过烧洋芋的孩子的眼中，他看到了强忍着泪滴的期望。
    龙泉乡穿石村一组的王远成一家3口衣衫褴褛，居住在一个用树枝、玉米秆搭起的四面透风的“埋叉房”（即简陋的窝棚）里。书记登上那胡乱用木棍架起的“楼”上时，整个窝棚竟然左右摇晃。
    他走进王远孝家，一家3口正蜷缩在一个月牙形的山洞里，唯一一口用来装粮的黑木箱空着，洞壁的一角堆码着睡觉用的玉米壳，火炕上煮着刚挖回的洋芋和野菜；他还得知，王远孝有一个12岁的女儿，因忍受不了饥饿，偷跑到了他乡。
    他想哭，却流不出眼泪。
    （2）当县委书记在全县干部大会上宣布宣汉县被列为“全国重点贫困山区县”时，全场死寂无声，人们把头埋得低低的。
    人口占全县总人口的5％，而贫困户就占全县贫困户总数14.2％的樊哙区，理所当然地成了重中之重。
    人们在思考：樊哙的希望在哪里？
    大规模地把那里的村民迁下山来吗？谈何容易！山里人什么都没有，唯有一种祖传的自矜，就是不能叫他搬家，那是最让人瞧不起的丑事了。1985年县上统一协调搬迁了18户，不久就悄悄地跑回来6户，他们说：离开这大山，他们就活不了。
    况且，又有哪个地方有这么大的本事能消化那么多人口呢？看来，只有在这山上作文章了。
    贫困的根源在哪里？杜自明又一次进山寻找答案。他发现社会主义的优越性在这里只不过作了最为简单的注释：国家每年救济的几十万元钱、几百万斤粮，人们吃得心安理得，反正共产党不会把人饿死冻死。年年的救济并没有把他们救出贫困，相反却养就了他们安于贫困的惰性，扼杀着他们同贫困抗争的意志。
    这该死的惰性呵！
    （3） 1985年初春，陕西汉中美专50名师生来百里峡写生实习。这里的山山水水令这些艺术骄子陶醉，这里的耕作制度对自然的破坏令他们叹息。
    每到播种时节，人们一把火烧秃一片山，砍掉树桩，挖去树蔸，撒下种子就等待收获，第二年又去烧种另一片山。为了今天的生存，不得不残酷地去毁灭着他们明天赖以生存的条件，无怪悲剧总是在这里年复一年上演着，而且愈演愈烈。无怪，结束“吃粮靠返销，用钱靠救济”的日子仍是那样遥遥无期。
    面对无情的现实，县委、县政府毅然作出决定：樊哙区停耕还林、还牧3.5万亩不宜耕种的陡坡地，缺粮户的口粮由国家供应指标。
    但是，供应粮食要钱去买。钱从何来？
    （4）专家来了；畜牧专家来了；林业专家来了；县上派的科技副乡长来了；县级对口扶贫单位的负责同志也来了。
    他们来共同“会诊”。他们要给这失血过多的土地开一张“药方”。
    反复论证，确定了“抓好以经济林为重点的林业生产，发展以草食牲畜为骨干的畜牧业生产”两条腿走路，找钱买米穿衣。
    于是，区委在全区范围内掀起了摆脱贫困“是坐等救济，还是靠自己”的大讨论；
    于是，用扶贫款买的第一批种苗分下来；
    于是，用财政周转金买的第一批种畜分下来。
    躺在国家身上几乎丧失了与贫困抗争能力的人们，现在要丢下拐杖，自己去寻找那根立足的魔杖了。
    （5）最近被评为“全国优秀党务工作者”的吴孝臣，1987年春刚接替区委书记职务就一头钻进了深山，全区8个乡的家家户户留下了他的足迹。这在“对面能说话，相会要一天”的大巴山深处，对于一个胃下垂12厘米的孱弱的身躯标志着什么？
    一个问题老是在他的脑海中萦绕：国家每年供应给我们区200万公斤粮食，从全县各地用汽车运到樊哙店，再靠一些小木船逆前河而上送往各乡，每年要补贴上百万元的运费和粮食差价，这对于一个财政连年赤字的山区大县来说，是一个多么沉重的负担！从农民方面来说，路程远的每次买粮来回得两、三天时间，山高路险，一次又只能扛三、四十公斤，豆腐也盘成肉价了。
    吴孝臣在寻找一个粮食自给的突破口。
    两个月后，一个樊哙区解决粮食自给的方案摆到了县委常委们的面前。
    当年，吴孝臣亲自负责抓的3个盖膜玉米示范点取得了意外的成功：海拔1900米的老黄山、1600米的小坪村、1000米的鸡唱坪试种盖膜玉米，平均亩产分别达到320公斤、350公斤、400公斤，比当地常规品种露地种植产量高出5倍多。
    千百年来无法改变的春迟秋早的高寒气候，竟在一层神奇的薄膜下驯服了。
    （6）县委、县政府发现了在这大山深处升起的一缕曙光。
    1988年，一场“白色革命”在樊哙山区轰轰烈烈地开展起来。可是，在这文盲占60％的地区，一项并不复杂的技术的推广却是那样步履维艰。
    白天开会动员，把统一贷款买来的地膜分到每家每户，晚上又有人悄悄地还给了村、社干部；
    数百名干部、技术人员巡回指导，但仍有30％不合种植要求；
    吃惯了返销粮的农户以要求国家保证口粮供应作为种植盖膜玉米的交换条件……
    从抓预留行到管理，县委书记3个月内5进百里峡；县农业局农艺师在深山不幸摔折了腰；供销、交通等部门及时组织运来了优质化肥。
    不相信薄薄的一层纸盖着就能收庄稼的农民，在半信半疑中种植了1.2万亩盖膜玉米。尽管，还不太规则。
    秋后算账，平均亩产306.5公斤，最高的超过500公斤，60％的贫困户第一次实现了口粮自给。全区救济粮供应一下子减少到42万公斤。
    贫困和饥饿把这些樊哙人推上了“白色革命”的战场，而他们一旦品尝到这成功之果时，便又推动着历史向前挺进。
    挺起的山脊
    千呼万唤，山魂终于醒来。当他慢慢地睁开眼睛，惊奇地发现，在自己的怀中竟高高地挺立起一道又一道的山脊。
    一大批共产党员、共青团员、妇女和普普通通的群众，他们在改造客观世界的同时，也在改造着自己的主观世界。他们是大山挺起的脊梁。
    （1）34岁的宁顺安，高中毕业回乡任民办教师已有15个春秋了。当他在一个冰雪未消的日子，踏进海拔2300多米高的鸡唱乡龙塘山上的一间小茅屋的时候，他不敢相信自己的眼睛：几块长木板、一张烂黑板、5个孩子组成了一方圣洁的天地——学校。
    他开始为故乡的明天耕耘，他开始向愚昧和无知宣战。
    两年后，他通过勤工俭学使该校全部实行免费入学，学生入学率和巩固率均达100％；
    1984年9月，宁顺安被调到茅坪村小学，很快便挽回了学生流失60％的残局；
    去年9月，他又被调到扇坡村茶园小学，他发动群众投劳集资，使这个已有20多年历史的学校校舍焕然一新。
    当他用自己微薄的工资给学生治病时，当他第一个为修学校捐款时，当他数年如一日地为孩子们免费理发时，当他在煤油灯下熬更守夜时……他觉得自己是大巴山中的一颗柳树，现代文明在他的心中绽开一片又一片嫩芽。
    1989年他被评为“全国教育系统劳动模范”，这是对他极高的奖赏。
    （2）1986年3月，对于李成良、周传兴来说很不寻常。这两个中学时的同窗好友在家乡的土地上再一次重逢了。只不过一个是作为乡党委书记，一个是作为乡长，他们要来共同建设自由乡这块令他们日思夜想的土地。
    上任不久，一份报告摆在了他们案前：2村7社陶化中申请承包开发林药场。
    陶化中何许人也？一个只有初中文化的普通青年农民。一家7口因自然条件太恶劣，乡上提出把他全家迁往山下居住。他提前悄悄跑出去“侦察”了一番，鬼使神差地产生了这一念头，于是就直撞撞地求援来了。
    在山里这可是件新鲜事。单纯造林见不到近期效益，而兼种药材又可以尽快见效，这可是一个方向。
    乡上立即批准了陶化中的申请，还给贷款5000元垫底。
    4月，陶化中带领10个人向荒山荒坡进军了。不到两年，建起了一个2300亩的林药场。队伍迅速壮大到30人，年人均收入近800元。
    如今，陶化中又带领一班人马到该乡最高的灵官庙去开辟新的战场了。他们播下的种子在全乡以至整个百里峡地区开花结果。全区这种成规模的林药果茶专业场已发展到44个。
    （3）1988年秋，在四周峭壁嶙峋的百里峡地区，第一次传来汽车喇叭的回声。原来，龙泉和自由两乡的人民在国家的支持下，靠自己的力量，两头相向各修了3.5公里断头公路。人们把汽车抬上木船，沿河而上，拖进山去，再用绳索捆着，抬上了公路。山民们里三层外三层地迎接这文明使者的到来。尽管道路仍很艰难，但他们坚信改变运输难的日子不会太远了。
    而今，樊哙到渡口的公路已经完工；樊哙大桥和樊哙到三墩的公路正在加紧修建；渡口乡到龙泉、鸡唱、自由三乡的单车道已列上了扶贫开发的议程。
    这里的山开始绿了，全区森林覆盖率由1984年的25％上升到今年的45％；172万株漆树、 202万株“三木”（厚朴、杜仲、黄柏）药材、75万株果树、8700亩黄连、天麻等名贵药材、7368亩茶叶、4000亩烟叶等其他经济作物和2.5万只山羊、9000多头牛、1.5万只兔、6.7万头生猪，展示出樊哙区广阔的前景。
    一个31年前在百里峡地区工作过的民政干部前不久故地重游，感慨万端：“当年鸡唱坪、茅坪等地的200多户农民只有3户有瓦房，而今户户盖起了新瓦房，真不可思议！”
    那些往常只能同月亮、星星和贫困为伍的人们，如今却通过收音机对山外的世界表示出了强烈的好奇；
    那些当初领了薄膜又悄悄还给村社干部的人们，那些只靠国家拿钱才搞地膜种植的人们，第一次饱尝了自己劳动的成果，便对种植盖膜玉米表现出极大的自觉性；
    那些祖祖辈辈都不识字的大老粗们，如今也懂得了送子上学。全区适龄儿童入学率达93.3％，在校学生巩固率达92.1％。
    与贫困抗争的生活，把樊哙人带入了一个崭新的天地。他们在走向富裕的同时也在追赶希望，他们在追求物质变化的同时也在追求精神面貌的改观。
    大山不再不语，它已把自强奋进的旗帜高高举起！
