    Chinese athletes secured 82 world championships in 1989, setting a new record for the most championships won in a single year. They also broke 35 world records.

    The General Administration of Sport of China (GASC) Director Wu Shaozu enthusiastically reported at the New Year's tea party held by the All-China Sports Federation and the Chinese Olympic Committee: "Looking back at this year, sports work has emerged from difficulties and is steadily advancing. The year 1990 is the year of the Asian Games, where we will decisively win. Currently, over 1,000 athletes are intensively training to strive for glory in the Asian Games."

    Deputy Director of the GASC, He Zhenliang, reported to the attendees on the achievements of the sports sector this year. Competitive sports have yielded abundant results, securing 82 world championships, 13 more gold medals than the previous record set in 1987; breaking 35 world records 47 times, 7 more than in 1987. Track and field, which has long been lagging, showed improvement this year, with women's shot put securing a world championship. In swimming, 6 athletes in 11 events entered the world's top 10. Gymnastics, which had previously declined, showed signs of recovery. At this year's World Gymnastics Championships, Chinese athletes performed exceptionally well, winning 3 gold medals. Meanwhile, mass sports are thriving. China has 45 million people who regularly participate in sports, and over 300 counties have established farmers' sports associations. Sports for the disabled and military sports have also seen significant development.

    Sports science is aligning with the world's sports powers, and the doping test center for the 11th Asian Games has been recognized by the International Olympic Committee.

    He Zhenliang also emphasized the new breakthroughs in sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait this year. Taiwan sent 12 teams to Beijing to participate in Asian competitions.

    At the meeting, He Zhenliang, on behalf of the All-China Sports Federation and the Chinese Olympic Committee, extended New Year greetings to friends in the Taiwan sports community.
