The Communist Party of China's Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Government recently decided to confer the title of "People's Guardian" on Chen Shanjian, who fought with a criminal, and to posthumously recognize Liu Xiqiang as a revolutionary martyr. The Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have called for a campaign throughout Fujian Province to learn from Chen Shanjian, Liu Xiqiang, and others.

On November 27 of this year, Chen Shanjian, the head of the Fujian Railway Station Police Station and a member of the Communist Party, was on duty when he discovered an armed criminal. During the struggle with the criminal, Chen was seriously injured but continued to direct the pursuit. Liu Xiqiang, the manager of the Fujian Railway Station Labor Service Company and a member of the Communist Party, saw the criminal shoot Chen and immediately rushed towards the criminal, sacrificing his life heroically. In the battle to capture the criminal, Communist Party members, including PLA soldier Han Jingwen, station security officer Yu Youyi, and police officer Xie Jie, bravely captured the criminal, making significant contributions to protecting the safety of people's lives and property and maintaining social stability. The Nanjing Military Region decided to award Han Jingwen the Second-Class Merit.

Chen Shanjian is a national labor model, recipient of the "May First Labor Medal," and a second-class model on the public security front. Over 29 years on the passenger transport duty post, he has honed his skills in fighting against lawbreakers and criminals. Since 1980, he has apprehended thousands of various lawbreakers and criminals and seized over 700 million yuan in smuggled goods. Over the past decade, he has rejected bribes 120 times, totaling over 60,000 yuan. He has been repeatedly honored as an "Outstanding Party Member" and "Red Flag Model" by the Ministry of Railways, the Fujian Provincial Committee, and the Provincial Government, and has been awarded the first-class merit on the public security front by the Ministry of Public Security and the Provincial Public Security Bureau.

Liu Xiqiang was strict with himself, honest, and upright in his duties. He has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced worker and model by the railway bureau and the station. His ability to stand up in critical moments is closely related to his high sense of political responsibility, strong organizational discipline, and his hatred of evil.

In the critical moment of capturing the armed murderer, the mainstay of this heroic group that disregarded life and death was mostly Communist Party members. They won the praise of the masses with their exemplary actions and added luster to the image of the Party.

    面对持枪歹徒肆虐行凶时  人民卫士奋不顾身捉罪犯
    福建省号召向陈善珉刘希强等学习
    本报福州12月6日电　记者张铭清报道：中共福建省委、省人民政府日前决定授予与歹徒搏斗的陈善珉“人民卫士”称号，追认英勇献身的刘希强为革命烈士。省委、省府号召福建全省开展向陈善珉、刘希强等同志学习的活动。
    今年11月27日，福州火车站派出所主任干事、共产党员陈善珉在执行公务时，发现一名持枪歹徒。在与歹徒搏斗时身负重伤仍指挥追捕。福州站劳动服务公司经理、共产党员刘希强见歹徒枪伤陈善珉，立即扑向歹徒，被凶犯击中而壮烈牺牲。在围捕凶犯的战斗中，共产党员、解放军战士韩静文、车站保安员余友义、派出所民警谢杰等奋不顾身，将罪犯捕获，为保卫人民生命财产安全和社会稳定立了大功。南京军区决定给韩静文记二等功。
    陈善珉同志是全国劳动模范、“五一劳动奖章”获得者、公安战线“二级英模”。29年的客运值勤岗位练就了他高超的与违法犯罪分子斗争的本领。自1980年以来，他抓获了各类违法犯罪分子数千名，缴获走私物品700多万元。10年来拒贿120余次，价值6万多元。先后多次被铁道部、福建省委、省府评为“优秀党员”、“红旗标兵”，被公安部和省公安厅记公安战线一等功。
    刘希强同志平时对自己严格要求，廉洁奉公，多次被铁路分局和车站评为先进工作者和先进标兵。他能在关键时刻挺身而出，与他平时高度的政治责任感、很强的组织纪律性和疾恶如仇的品质是分不开的。
    在围捕持枪杀人凶犯的关键时刻，这个置生死于度外的英雄群体主要骨干都是共产党员。他们以自己的模范行动赢得了群众的赞誉，为党的形象增添了光彩。
