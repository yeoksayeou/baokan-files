Liu Shushu's "A Brief History of Chinese Statistics" has been published by Hubei People's Publishing House. This book is the first relatively systematic and complete monograph on statistical history in our country. The book, with over 300,000 words, begins with the origin of counting knowledge in primitive society and the budding of statistics in slave society, and focuses on introducing the statistical thoughts, statistical systems, statistical methods, and the role of statistics in historical development during various periods from the feudal society and semi-colonial and semi-feudal society to the eve of the founding of New China. The author uses a large amount of verified historical facts to provide a fairly detailed explanation of our country's ancient, long-standing, and rich historical heritage, as well as the backward development of statistics under the oppression of imperialism and the constraints of feudalism in modern times, and the achievements made under difficult conditions. The publication of this book has made a certain contribution to the study of Chinese statistical history, enriching the content of world statistical history, and drawing nutrition from ancient Chinese statistical history to promote current statistical construction, achieving the goal of learning from the past to serve the present.
