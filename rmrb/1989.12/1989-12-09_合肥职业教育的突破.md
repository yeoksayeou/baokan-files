In the summer and autumn of 1989, many large and medium-sized cities across the country faced a worrying phenomenon: due to the state's continued reduction in construction scale and the control of labor employment, the number of applicants for vocational schools dropped sharply, and vocational education began to decline.

However, in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, the situation was quite different: all 26 vocational high schools in the city were fully enrolled, and some schools had to repeatedly revise their enrollment plans due to the continuous increase in the number of applicants. Statistics from the Hefei Municipal Education Bureau show that from January to September this year, the city's vocational high schools, vocational secondary schools, and technical schools collectively enrolled more than 4,500 students, continuing to surpass the enrollment numbers of regular high schools.

Why has Hefei's vocational education remained vibrant and maintained a good momentum of development?

"Single-Wheeled Cart" Becomes "Dual-Drive"

Vocational education is primarily aimed at cultivating mid-level technical talents for society and enterprises. Under the current system in China, if the labor department, which manages labor and employment, does not participate, relying solely on the education department to run schools is like a single-wheeled cart navigating a winding path, obviously unable to drive vocational education towards vigorous development.

A few years ago, due to the lack of coordination between the education and labor departments in Hefei, vocational education and labor employment were disconnected, leading to slow development of vocational high schools and enrollment numbers stagnating around 800. After investigating this issue, the municipal party committee and government decided to break the deadlock and get out of the predicament of the education department running schools alone. They implemented simultaneous reforms of the education system and labor system. The municipal party committee and government formulated a policy of "training first, employment later," stipulating that social recruitment must select and employ qualified personnel who have undergone vocational technical training. Subsequently, the education and labor departments jointly established the Municipal Vocational Technical Education Office. This new management and decision-making body implemented "five unifications" of macro-control over the plans for personnel demand forecasting, enrollment, teaching, graduate employment, and social recruitment. The education and labor departments jointly managed but focused on different aspects. The labor department forecasts the employment situation of various enterprises and institutions every spring and formulates a three-year "rolling plan" for social recruitment. In the autumn, it guides schools and enterprises in recommending and selecting vocational high school graduates. The education department focuses on the setup of vocational school specialties, teaching management, and student experimentation and internship guidance.

At the same time, the labor department also implements a quota system and contract labor system for graduates of technical schools, making the learning system and labor allocation of technical schools and vocational high schools gradually consistent. The "single-wheeled cart" has become a "dual-drive."

In recent years, the enrollment numbers of vocational high schools in Hefei have soared, and the ratio of vocational school enrollment to regular high school enrollment has been maintained or exceeded 1:1. More than 90% of vocational high school graduates are selected and employed by society and enterprises every year.

Joint School Operation Has a Foundation

The education department lacks funds, professional teachers, and internship venues for vocational education. How to change this situation? After streamlining the management system of vocational education, Hefei has come up with a new strategy: vigorously developing joint school operations primarily led by industry departments and enterprises. The biggest advantage of this form is that it provides a foundation for vocational education, and the contradictions that the education department cannot solve can be easily resolved. Educational funds are supplemented, professional teachers are sourced, internship venues are guaranteed, and graduate placement is secured. Currently, 12 of the city's 26 vocational high schools are mainly operated by enterprises, and the remaining schools operated by the education department and social forces also have relatively stable affiliated units. In recent years, more than 75% of the various vocational classes enrolled each year in the city have joint operation units, involving 27 industry bureaus and companies, and more than 50 enterprises and institutions. In September this year, the city also jointly operated a "dual-system" experimental school with Lower Saxony, Germany.

Hefei Heavy Machinery Vocational High School is a joint operation between Hefei Forklift Factory and Heavy Machinery Middle School. The school's funding, which accounts for more than 80% of the annual budget, is provided by the factory. Professional teachers are selected from the factory's outstanding engineering and technical personnel, and students' daily experiments and internships are conducted in various sub-factories. Principal Qiu Zuru told the reporter that the school has trained more than 210 students in the past three years. These students not only have a certain level of professional theory but also have strong practical skills. Many of them have become key technical workers in enterprises shortly after graduation. Therefore, during the graduation placement period each year, various sub-factories under the factory compete to "recruit" students, often resulting in a situation of "supply not meeting demand."

More Adapted to the Needs of Social Development

Most of China's vocational education has developed from general education, so it inevitably carries the characteristics of general education and often deviates from the needs of social and economic construction. Hefei's vocational education strives to overcome this shortcoming. In recent years, the education and labor departments have continuously adjusted and reformed the internal setup and professional structure of vocational education, proactively adapting to the needs of local economic construction and social development. Currently, the city has 11 major categories and 71 specialties, including metallurgy, machinery, electrical appliances, power, textiles, light industry, chemical industry, municipal construction, medical care, economic management, and commercial services, initially forming a vocational education layout that is basically adapted to the city's industrial structure.

Since last year, due to the state's tightening of monetary policy and reduction in construction scale, enterprise employment has been restricted. In response to this change, the education and labor departments timely adjusted and revised the enrollment plan this year, relatively reducing the number of enrollments in science and engineering, while expanding the number of enrollments in commercial services and rural-oriented categories. More than 10 new specialties have been added, including beauty, fashion design and performance, commercial accounting, fruit tree cultivation, and storage processing. These specialties, with their strong practicality and trendy characteristics, are very popular in society.

    合肥职业教育的突破
    新华社记者　蒋志敏
    1989年夏秋之交，全国不少大中城市出现了一个令人忧虑的现象：由于国家继续压缩基建规模，企业用工受到控制，报考职业学校人数锐减，职业教育开始出现“滑坡”！
    然而，在安徽省的合肥市，情况却迥然不同：全市26所职业高中，校校报名爆满，有的学校因报名人数一再突破而不得不多次修订招生计划。来自合肥市教育局的统计表明：今年1至9月，该市包括职业高中、职业中专、技工学校等各种职业学校共招生4500多人，继续超过普通高中的招生数。
    合肥市职业教育为何长盛不衰，一直保持良好的发展势头？
    “独轮车”变成“双轮驱动”
    职业教育，主要是为社会和企事业单位培养适用的中等技术人才。在我国目前的体制下，如果没有掌管劳动就业大权的劳动部门参与，仅靠教育部门独家办学，犹如独轮车行驶羊肠道，显然无法把职业教育引向蓬勃发展。
    前几年，合肥市由于教育部门与劳动部门互不联系，职业教育与劳动就业互相脱节，职业高中发展缓慢，招生数一直为800人左右。市委、市政府调查发现这一问题后，决定打破僵局，摆脱教育部门独家办学的困境，实行教育制度和劳动制度的同步改革。市委、市政府制订了“先培训、后就业”的政策，规定社会招工一律从经过职业技术培训的合格人员中择优录用。接着，由教育和劳动部门两家联合成立全市职业技术教育办公室。这个新的管理、决策机构，对用人预测计划、招生计划、教学计划、毕业生录用计划和社会招工计划实行“五统一”的宏观调控，教育、劳动两部门既共同管理，又各有侧重。劳动部门每年春季对各企事业单位的用工情况进行预测，并制订社会招工的3年“滚动计划”；秋季又指导学校和企事业做好职业高中毕业生的推荐与择优录用工作。教育部门则着重抓好职业学校的专业设置、教学管理和学生实验、实习指导工作。
    与此同时，劳动部门也对技工学校毕业生实行差额分配和合同工制，技工学校也像职业高中那样实行1—3年的灵活学制，使技工学校、职业高中在学制和用工分配等方面逐步趋于一致。“独轮车”变成“双轮驱动”。
    近几年来，合肥市职业高中的招生数扶摇直上，职业教育类学校招生数与普通高中招生数的比例一直保持或超过1∶1；职业高中的毕业生，每年都有90％以上被社会和企事业单位择优录用。
    联合办学有依托
    教育部门办职业教育缺乏经费，缺乏专业教师，缺乏实习场地……如何改变这种状况？合肥市在理顺职业教育管理体制之后，又使出新招：大力发展以行业部门和企事业单位为主的联合办学。这种形式的最大好处，就在于使职业教育有了依托，教育部门无法解决的矛盾都可以迎刃而解。教育经费有了补充，专业教师有了来源，实习场地得到保证，毕业生分配有了去向。目前，该市26所职业高中，有12所主要由企事业单位主办，其余由教育部门和社会力量主办的学校也都有相对稳定的挂钩单位。近几年全市每年招收的各种职业班，有联办单位的占75％以上，联办的行业有27家主管局和公司，联办的企事业单位达50多家。今年9月，该市还与联邦德国下萨克森州联合举办了一所“双元制”试验学校。
    合肥重机职业高级中学是由合肥叉车总厂与重机中学联办的。这个学校每年经费的80％以上由总厂提供，专业教师从厂里优秀的工程技术人员中选聘，学生日常的实验和实习也都在各个分厂进行。校长裘祖芮告诉记者，该校3年来已培养了210多名学生。这些学生既有一定的专业理论，又有很强的动手能力，许多人毕业不久就成为企业的骨干技术工人。因此，每年毕业分配时期，总厂下属各个分厂都纷纷前来“抢”学生，以致常常发生“供不应求”的现象。
    更加适应社会发展的需要
    我国的职业教育，大多是从普通教育中发展起来的，因此都不可避免地带有普通教育的痕迹，往往与社会和经济建设的需要相脱节。合肥市的职业教育努力克服这个弊端。几年来，教育、劳动部门不断注意调整、改革职业教育的内部设置、专业结构，主动适应当地经济建设和社会发展的需要。目前，该市已有冶金、机械、电工电器、电力、纺织、轻工、化工、市政建设、医护、经济管理及商业服务11大类71个专业，初步形成了与本市产业结构基本相适应的职业教育布局。
    去年以来，由于国家紧缩银根，压缩基建规模，使企业用工受到了限制。根据这一变化，教育、劳动部门今年及时调整、修订招生计划，相对压缩工科类招生人数，同时扩大商业服务和面向农村类的招生数，新增加了美容、时装设计与表演、商业会计以及果树栽培、贮藏加工等10多个专业。这些专业因有很强的实用性，又具备“新潮”特点，很受社会的欢迎。　（新华社供本报专稿）
