Last autumn, a friend returned to Beijing from Zhengzhou and excitedly told me that he had seen two excellent performances there: one was the traditional Henan opera "The Great Sacrifice," and the other was the historical drama "The Powdered Grudge." Both were starring Hu Meiling. He highly praised her performance, describing it as simple yet passionate, unrestrained yet delicate. This made me imagine a beautiful figure.

Recently, Hu Meiling's solo performance of selected scenes was staged in Beijing, featuring three acts: "Weeping at the Tower" and "Beating the Road" from "The Great Sacrifice," "Carrying the Bride" and "Sitting in the Sedan Chair" from "Carrying the Bride," and "Thinking of Home" from "Hua Mulan." These three acts were well-matched, including tragedy, comedy, and serious drama; featuring both young female roles and martial roles, fully showcasing the performer's multifaceted talents. Hu Meiling's performance left me with several striking impressions.

Firstly, she sings exceptionally well. Hu Meiling is a disciple of the Xiangyu School, and "singing" is her main strength. The Xiangyu School's singing style is characterized by its unrestrained, melodious, delicate, and subtle qualities, all of which she has mastered and performs accurately. However, one can also sense the bright and pure tones of the Ma (Jinfeng) and Yan (Lipin) Schools in her singing. Additionally, she incorporates elements of Hebei Bangzi and opera singing techniques into her performance, making her expression more rich and varied. Hu Meiling has a good voice, clear, sweet, relaxed, and natural, effortlessly navigating her roles. In the scene "Beating the Road," the long passage "Mother-in-law, please calm down and stand at the crossroads" is sung with such heart-wrenching emotion and blood-stained tears, unrestrained yet subtle, rough yet delicate, truly leaving a lingering impression.

Secondly, she excels in character portrayal. The three acts feature three distinct characters, roles, and types, with vastly different personalities, thoughts, emotions, and inner qualities. Huang Guirong is a strong-willed young lady from a wealthy family; Zhou Fenglian is a lively and charming young girl; Hua Mulan is a female warrior disguised as a man. Hu Meiling portrays them all with distinct emotions and spirits. When portraying Huang Guirong, she uses singing to express the character's inner voice and water sleeves to showcase the character's emotional changes. Her "double rolling sleeves," "standing sleeves," and water sleeves "double shoulder" are all used appropriately, conveying Huang Guirong's complex emotions before her execution. For Zhou Fenglian, she emphasizes her unrestrained, innocent, and lovable personality, contrasting sharply with the typical shy and reserved girls of feudal times. "Thinking of Home" is a scene from "Mulan Joins the Army," where Hua Mulan, after 12 years of war, is a general. Hu Meiling perfectly balances Hua Mulan's heroic spirit and the hidden feminine tenderness beneath her armor.

Thirdly, she embodies a strong local flavor. Henan opera differs from Beijing opera, Sichuan opera, and Yue opera; it reflects the lives and local customs of the people of central China. Some say Henan opera has a "rustic" or "sweet potato" flavor, which should not be seen as a criticism. It is precisely because Henan opera is easy to understand and rich in life's essence that it is beloved by the masses. I, as an audience member, am drawn to Hu Meiling's performance because she has inherited and developed the local characteristics of Henan opera, building on the art of her predecessors. This is a crucial factor in her success.

Hu Meiling is now in her prime, sincere and modest, speaking little but respectful of her elders. She mentioned that Comrade Xiangyu had seriously taught her, and her growth greatly benefited from her teacher's guidance. She often performs in places like the Xinjiang and North China oil fields, where oil workers and farmers from central China warmly welcome her. She has a wish: to continually offer high-quality performances to the people.

    唱做俱佳的虎美玲
    郭汉城
    去年秋季，一位朋友从郑州返京，很兴奋地告诉我，他在郑州看了两台好戏，一台是豫剧传统戏《大祭桩》；一台是历史故事戏《粉黛冤家》，都是由虎美玲主演的。他很赞赏她的表演质朴而又热情，奔放而又细腻，这使我在想象中产生一个优美的形象。
    近日，虎美玲的折子戏专场在京演出，共演出了《大祭桩》的“哭楼·打路”、《抬花轿》的“提亲·坐轿”、《花木兰》的
  “思家”三出戏。这三出戏搭配得非常好，有悲剧、喜剧，又有正剧；有闺门旦、花旦，又有武生，充分发挥了演员多方面的才能。虎美玲的表演给我留下了以下几个突出的印象。
    一是唱得好。虎美玲宗常
  （香玉）派，“唱”是她的主要优势。常派唱腔具有奔放、嘹亮、委婉、细腻的特色，她都学得好，唱得准；但从中也可以品味出马（金凤）派、阎（立品）派明丽、纯净的韵味。还可以感受到她在唱腔中揉进了河北梆子和歌剧的一些唱法，使表现力更为丰富。美玲的嗓子条件好，清脆、甜润、轻松、自然，游刃有余。“打路”一场，那一段“婆母娘且息怒站在路口”的大段唱，如泣如诉的表白、含血带泪的倾吐，奔放不失含蓄，粗犷仍伏纤细，确有余音绕梁的效果。
    二是演人物。这三折戏，三个人物三种行当、三种类型，性格反差很大，思想情感和内在气质大不相同。黄桂英是意志坚强的大家闺秀；周凤莲是娇憨活泼的闺门小姐；花木兰则是女扮男妆的巾帼英雄。美玲却能把他们演得出情传神、迥然不同。她在塑造黄桂英这一角色时，一是用唱表达人物的心声；二是用水袖展示人物情绪的变化。她的“双滚袖”、“立袖”、水袖“双搭肩”都用得比较贴切，传达出了黄桂英奔赴法场前的复杂情绪；对周凤莲这个人物，着重突出她无拘无束、天真烂漫的可爱性格，和一般娴静、羞涩的封建时代的少女形成鲜明的对比。“思家”是《木兰从军》中的一场，这时的花木兰，已是经过12年战争磨练的将军。美玲把花木兰的威武气魄和隐藏在战袍之内的女儿柔情，都表现得恰到好处。
    三是浓郁的地方特色。豫剧不同于京剧、川剧、越剧，它是中原劳动人民生活和乡土气息的体现。有人说豫剧有“土气”，有“红薯味”，这不应看成贬词。正因为豫剧通俗易懂，生活气息浓郁，才为广大观众所喜爱。像我这样的观众所以被虎美玲的表演所吸引，正是她继承发扬了豫剧的地方特色，在前人艺术的基础上，有所发展，但仍不失豫剧的特征。这是她取得成功的一个重要因素。
    虎美玲已人到中年，诚恳朴实，寡言少语，尊敬前辈。她说常香玉同志曾认真地教过她，她的成长很大程度上得益于老师的教诲。她经常到新疆油田、华北油田等地演出，油田职工和中原农民都很欢迎她。她有一个心愿：把优质产品不断奉献给人民。（下图为虎美玲表演速写。作者：傅旭）
