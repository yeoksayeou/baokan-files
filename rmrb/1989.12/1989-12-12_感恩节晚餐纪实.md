A heavy snowfall had left Washington's temperature below zero Celsius. The initial snowfall added color to Thanksgiving, but the cold wind made people shiver.

Thanksgiving is a traditional American holiday. On this night, families gather to enjoy a sumptuous dinner featuring turkey, celebrating the harvest and giving thanks to God. However, not all Americans can enjoy this festive joy.

At around 3:30 PM on November 23, when the reporter arrived at the lawn west of the Capitol Building, he found himself in another world. Hundreds of men, women, and children formed a long line, waiting to receive charity meals donated by charitable organizations. Despite their frozen fingers, the diners ate with relish.

The busiest person on the scene was the organizer of this Thanksgiving meal, Mitch Schneider. The diners seemed familiar with him, and many shook his hand and chatted with him, expressing their gratitude for his hard work. Various reporters also kept interviewing him. Wrapped in a yellow blanket, he was quite noticeable. When asked why he chose to hold this Thanksgiving meal in front of the Capitol Building, he said the purpose was to send a message to the Congress and the White House, that tens of thousands of Americans today have nothing to be thankful for. They have no place to live, and they lack food and clothing. He hoped the authorities could solve this serious social problem. Schneider used to be a corporate management consultant earning tens of thousands of dollars a year. In 1972, he founded an organization dedicated to the welfare of the homeless and the hungry. The shelter he manages houses over 1,000 homeless people and provides them with dinner year-round, with food donated by various charitable organizations and grocery stores.

Most of those who came to eat were black and Latin American immigrants, with a few white people. Some were embarrassed and unwilling to talk to the reporter. However, a black man named Sterling happily accepted the reporter's interview. Sterling said, "I've been unemployed for a year and a half. My wife and children have jobs, but I live a vagrant life. How can I go home without money as a husband and father?" The reporter also talked with another diner named Florence. For 15 years, he wandered the streets during the day and stayed in shelters at night. From his words, Florence seemed very familiar with the charitable organizations in Washington that provide food. He also humorously said, "Living this way, you can't be lazy, you have to keep moving. As long as you walk around, you can find food to eat, because Washington has many charitable organizations that provide free food for the poor."

According to the organizer, about 2,000 people came to eat today. Even when the reporter left at around 5:30 PM, there were still a few hundred people left. For them, today was a feast, but what about tomorrow?

    感恩节晚餐纪实
    本报记者　张亮
    一场大雪过后，华盛顿的气温降到零摄氏度以下。初次银装给感恩节增添了色彩，但寒风袭来，使人冷得有点发抖。
    感恩节是美国的一个传统节日。这天晚上，全家团聚，共进以火鸡为主食的丰盛晚餐，以“庆贺粮食丰收并感谢上帝的恩赐。”然而，并不是所有美国人都能享受这种节日的欢乐的。
    11月23日下午3点多钟，当记者来到国会大厦西侧的草坪时，发现那里是另外一个世界。数以百计的男女老少排成一条长龙，等着领取慈善团体施舍的节日饭餐。就餐者尽管手指冻得有点颤抖，但吃得津津有味。
    场上最忙的要算这次节日饭餐的组织者米奇·施奈德了。用餐者对他似乎很熟悉，许多人同他握手交谈，感谢他的辛劳。各路记者也不停地采访他。他披着一条黄色棉被，很引人注目。当记者问他为何选择在国会大厦前举办这次节日饭餐时，他说，目的是向国会和白宫传递一个信息，成千上万的美国人今天并没有什么恩可感，他们既无栖身之地，又缺吃少穿，他希望当局能解决这一严重的社会问题。施奈德曾当过年薪几万美元的企业管理顾问，于1972年创建了一个专为流浪者和饥饿者谋利益的组织。他管理的一处收容所收容了1000多名流浪者，并向他们常年提供晚餐，其食品是由一些慈善团体和食品店捐赠的。
    前来用餐的大多是黑人和拉美移民，也有少数白人。一些人怕丢面子，不愿与记者交谈。但一位名叫斯特林的黑人高兴地接受了记者的采访。斯特林说：“我失业已一年半了，家里有妻子儿女，他们都有工作。但我过的是流浪生活，因为当丈夫和父亲的不拿着钱，怎么好意思回家呢？”记者还与另外一位用餐者交谈。他叫弗洛伦斯，15年来他白天流落街头，晚上住收容所。听起来，弗洛伦斯对华盛顿提供食品的慈善机构了如指掌。他还风趣地说，“过这种生活不能当懒汉，脚步要勤快。只要肯走动，是可以找到饭吃的，因为华盛顿有不少慈善机构为穷人提供免费食品”。
    据组织者估计，今天前来用餐的大约有2000人。直到记者下午5点多离开时，场地上还有几百人，对他们来说，今天算是美餐了一顿，但是，明天将投向何方呢？（附图片）
