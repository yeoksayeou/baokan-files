The current pattern of "offices managing societal affairs" will not undergo significant changes in the near future. The guiding ideology for the current reform of office logistics work is to proceed from the country's actual conditions, adhere to the tradition of hard work and struggle, and adopt a positive, stable, and gradual approach to create conditions for the socialization of office logistics services. The nationwide government system office logistics work reform conference was held in Beijing today. Vice Premier of the State Council, Chang Jie, presented the above ideas to the attendees.

This conference is the first nationwide government system conference specifically dedicated to discussing office logistics work since the founding of the nation. The conference calls for the government system to actively promote various forms of responsibility systems, strengthen the construction of clean government, and provide practical service guarantees to improve the efficiency of government work. The conference will also exchange beneficial experiences from local government logistics work.
