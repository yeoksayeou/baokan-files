The activity of user comments on the quality of mechanical and electrical products and enterprise service quality has recently concluded. The Ministry of Mechanical Industry today in Beijing announced the list of 19 excellent service units.

This activity began in October 1988, organized by the Ministry of Mechanical Industry and the China Machinery and Electrical Products News, primarily to comment on the quality of equipment and service quality provided by mechanical and electrical enterprises for national key projects during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period. After the newspaper criticized the Hangzhou Steam Turbine Factory for quality issues in the equipment provided to the Lianyungang Soda Plant, the factory immediately provided on-site service, made timely improvements, and the factory director led a team to visit other key projects, actively seeking user feedback on the factory's products. In the Qinhuangdao Coal Pier Phase III project, Jiangnan Shipyard dispatched 198 personnel to the construction site to resolve installation issues in a timely manner, receiving positive feedback from users.

    用户评论机电产品结束
    机电部公布优秀单位名单
    本报北京12月26日讯　记者皮树义报道：用户评论机电产品质量和企业服务质量活动日前结束。机电部今天在京公布了评出的19家优秀服务单位名单。
    这项活动从1988年10月开始，由机电部授权中国机电报组织，主要是对“七五”期间机电企业为国家重点工程提供的设备质量和服务质量进行评论。报纸批评杭州汽轮机厂为连云港纯碱厂提供的设备有质量问题后，该厂立即上门服务，及时改进，厂长还带队走访了其它重点工程，主动征求用户对本厂产品的意见。江南造船厂在秦皇岛煤码头三期工程中，先后派出198名人员到工地现场服务，及时解决设备安装中的问题，受到用户好评。
