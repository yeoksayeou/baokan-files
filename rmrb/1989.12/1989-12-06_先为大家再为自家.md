The ten years of reform have opened up new horizons for people to navigate the seas of a commodity economy. Establishing companies, opening factories, and engaging in transportation have made some people wealthy, with some even becoming extremely rich. Among them, there are indeed those who engage in fraud, deception, and swindling, who are harmful to the group. However, there are also many who are willing to contribute to society and the people, such as good managers and good factory directors like Cui Xiuzhen. His company has correctly prioritized the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, making it a company with distinct Chinese characteristics.

Socialist Chinese enterprises, including state-owned and collective enterprises, are fundamentally different from capitalist enterprises in Western countries. Of course, we run enterprises to make money, but we cannot do so by any means necessary or with the sole aim of making money. The ultimate goal is to develop productive forces, to make the country prosperous and the people affluent as quickly as possible, rather than to make a few people millionaires while the majority remain in poverty. Enterprises must adhere to a socialist direction, maintain integrity, and uphold the Party's fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance. They must not misplace their efforts. Some enterprises and so-called "capable individuals" may have had their moments of glory, but their success is often short-lived. The reason is often that they forget that China is a socialist country and fail to operate their enterprises based on this fundamental principle, correctly handling the relationship between profits and serving society and the people.

Cui Xiuzhen's experience in running an enterprise has shown that an individual's fate is inseparable from the fate of the country. Without the country's prosperity, there can be no personal happiness. More comrades should understand these truths. Only by clarifying these points in their minds can they, like Cui Xiuzhen, "first take care of the collective 'home,' and then their own 'home.'"

    先为大家再为自家
    十年改革，为人们开拓了在商品经济海洋里搏浪击水的新局面。办公司，开工厂，搞运输，使一部分人先富了起来，有的甚至富得“流油”。在他们中确实有倒来倒去，坑蒙拐骗的害群之马。但确实也不乏甘愿奉献社会、奉献人民的好经理，好厂长，崔秀镇就是其中的一个。他的公司摆正了一国家、二集体、三个人的关系，是一家颇具中国特色的企业。
    社会主义中国的企业，包括国营企业、集体企业，与西方国家的资本主义企业有本质的不同。我们办企业当然也要赚钱，但不能不择手段、“一切向钱看”，总的目的是为了发展生产力，使国家尽快富强起来，使人民尽快富裕起来，而不是为了使极少数人成为百万富翁，大多数人还处于贫困境地。企业要讲社会主义方向，要讲廉洁，还要发扬党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，不能把功夫下错地方。有些企业，有些“能人”，虽然也曾经大红大紫过一阵子，可是好景不长，原因往往在于他们忘记了中国是社会主义国家，忘记了从这个根本原则出发来经营自己的企业，正确地处理盈利与服务社会、奉献人民的关系。
    崔秀镇办企业体会到：个人的命运与国家的命运是分不开的，没有国家的振兴就没有个人的幸福。更多的同志也应该认识到这些道理。只有在思想上明确了，才能像崔秀镇那样“先为大家的‘家’，再为自己的‘家’。”
