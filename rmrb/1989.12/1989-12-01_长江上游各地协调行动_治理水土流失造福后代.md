A joint committee for the coordinated management of the ecological environment in the upper Yangtze River region— the Upper Yangtze River 12 Regions, Prefectures, and Cities Soil and Water Conservation Professional Coordination Committee—was recently established in Bijiang Region, Guizhou Province.

This committee is composed of 12 regions, prefectures, and cities in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, including Zhaotong, Dongchuan, Chuxiong, Lijiang, Liangshan, Diqing, Panzhihua, Bijiang, Yibin, Luzhou, Leshan, and Ganzi.

These regions, located in the upper Yangtze River basin, are among the most impoverished areas in China and are home to many ethnic minorities. Due to natural conditions and historical factors, the ecological environment here has been continuously degraded, leading to severe soil erosion. This has put the Yangtze River at risk of becoming a second Yellow River. To ensure the Yangtze River flows green and clear, benefiting future generations, leaders and experts from agriculture, forestry, and water resources from the 12 regions, prefectures, and cities gathered in Bijiang Region to discuss how to coordinate and research systematic management of soil erosion in the upper Yangtze River and Bijiang Region. The attendees agreed that, given the vast area and limited financial and material resources of the 12 regions, prefectures, and cities, it is essential to unite and leverage professional and industry advantages to comprehensively manage the ecological environment of the upper Yangtze River, achieving greater results with less effort.

The coordination committee will formulate a comprehensive plan for soil erosion control in the cooperation zone, study treatment policies, coordinate upstream and downstream treatment work, solve major technical difficulties in treatment, and share treatment experiences.

    长江上游各地协调行动  治理水土流失造福后代
    本报贵阳电　记者潘帝都报道：一个共同协调治理长江上游生态环境的跨地区联合体——长江上游12地、州、市水土保持专业协调委员会，最近在贵州省毕节地区成立。
    这个委员会是由川、滇、黔毗邻的昭通、东川、楚雄、丽江、凉山、迪庆、攀枝花、毕节、宜宾、泸州、乐山、甘孜12个地、州、市组成的。
    地处长江上游流域的这些地州市，均为我国连片的贫困地区，也是少数民族聚居的地区。由于自然条件和历史原因，这里的生态环境不断遭受破坏，水土流失极为严重，已使长江濒临变成第二条黄河的危险。为使长江绿水奔流，造福子孙后代，12个地州市领导和农林水等有关方面专家聚会毕节地区，就如何配合国家对长江上游金沙江及毕节地区水土流失的系统治理进行协调、研究。与会者认为，12个地州市地域广阔，而财力物力又很有限，只有联合起来，集中专业、行业优势，齐心协力对长江上游生态环境进行综合治理，才能收到事半功倍的效果。
    协调委员会将制定协作区水土流失综合治理总体规划，研究治理政策，协调上下游治理工作，解决重大治理技术难题，交流治理经验。
