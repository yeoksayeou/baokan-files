The special session of the United Nations General Assembly on "Apartheid and Its Destructive Impact in Southern Africa" concluded tonight at the United Nations headquarters. At the closing meeting, representatives from over 100 countries unanimously adopted a declaration without a vote, calling for negotiations between the South African government and South African national liberation organizations to politically resolve the South African issue, with the ultimate goal of establishing a non-racial democratic state in South Africa.

The declaration, titled "Declaration on Apartheid and Its Destructive Impact in Southern Africa," was drafted by the frontline states of Africa and other African countries. After several days of frequent consultations and revisions among the attending representatives, the final draft was completed. It reflects the consensus of the international community on the current situation regarding the end of the apartheid system in South Africa.

The declaration states that there can be no peace and justice where there is colonialism, racism, and apartheid rule. For lasting peace and stability in Southern Africa, the apartheid system in South Africa must first be eliminated, transforming South Africa into a unified, democratic, and non-racial nation.

The declaration encourages the people of South Africa to sit down together to negotiate an end to the apartheid system and to agree on all necessary measures to transform South Africa into a non-racial democratic state. The declaration points out that if the Pretoria government is willing to engage in negotiations in good faith, there is a possibility of ending apartheid through negotiations.

The declaration calls on the South African authorities to take measures such as the unconditional release of all political prisoners, the termination of the state of emergency, and the withdrawal of troops from various towns to create the necessary atmosphere for negotiations.

The declaration concludes with an action plan, calling for effective measures, including the full compliance of all countries with the arms embargo, to exert pressure on the South African government to quickly end the apartheid system.

In his closing remarks, Chairman Joseph Garba stated that the declaration just adopted by the conference sends a clear message to the South African government: the international community is united in its determination to eradicate the apartheid system from the face of the earth.

    关于种族隔离特别联大闭幕
    通过政治解决南非问题宣言
    本报联合国12月14日电　记者刘开宸报道：关于“种族隔离及其在南部非洲破坏性影响”联大特别会议，今晚在联合国大厦闭幕。闭幕会议上，100多个国家的代表未经表决，一致通过了一个宣言，要求南非政权和南非民族解放组织就政治解决南非问题举行谈判，以便最终在南非建立一个不分种族的民主国家。
    题为《关于种族隔离及其在南部非洲破坏性影响的宣言》是由非洲前线国家和其他一些非洲国家起草，在与会代表间进行几天的频繁磋商、修改后定稿的，表达了国际社会在目前形势下对结束南非种族隔离制度取得的共识。
    《宣言》指出，哪里有殖民主义、种族主义和种族隔离统治，那里就不会有和平和正义。南部非洲要实现持久和平与稳定，必须首先消除南非的种族隔离制度，将南非转变成一个统一的、民主的和不分种族的国家。
    《宣言》鼓励南非人民坐到一起为结束种族隔离制度进行谈判，并就采取一切必要措施使南非转变成为一个不分种族的民主国家达成协议。《宣言》指出，如果比勒陀利亚政权准备真诚地参与谈判，就可能出现通过谈判来结束种族隔离的局面。
    《宣言》要求南非当局采取无条件释放全部政治犯、终止紧急状态、把部队撤出各城镇等措施，以创造必要的谈判气氛。
    《宣言》最后提出了行动纲领，要采取有效措施，包括各国全面遵守武器禁令，以便向南非政权施加压力，让它迅速结束种族隔离制度。
    大会主席约瑟夫·加尔巴在会议闭幕时发表讲话指出，会议刚通过的《宣言》是向南非政权传递一个明确的信息，国际社会一致决心要使种族隔离制度从地球上消失。
