	Hong Kong's financial institutions have seen a rise in foreign currency deposits. In October, foreign currency deposits accounted for more than 60% of the total deposits, with a growth rate exceeding that of Hong Kong dollar deposits. Non-dollar foreign currency deposits have shown even faster growth. Experts believe that Hong Kong investors are increasingly diversifying their choices.

	According to the latest statistics from the Hong Kong government, the total deposit amount in October was HK$958.7 billion. Of this, HK$373.9 billion was in Hong Kong dollars, a decrease of 0.1% from September; USD$381 billion, an increase of 2.5% from the previous month; and other foreign currencies amounted to HK$276.6 billion, an increase of 4.2%.

	Experts believe that the rapid growth of foreign currency deposits is mainly due to the fact that the interest rates for most foreign currencies are currently higher than those for the Hong Kong dollar. Additionally, investors can choose both high-yielding currencies and strong currencies for their deposits.

    香港外币存款呈上升趋势
    新华社香港十二月九日电 （记者史晓帆）香港各金融机构吸收的外币存款呈上升趋势。十月份外币存款已占存款总额的百分之六十以上，增长率也超过港元存款，其中非美元存款的增长更快。专家认为香港投资者的选择日趋多样。
    据港府最新统计数字，十月份的存款总额为九千五百八十七亿多港元。其中港元存款三千七百三十九亿多港元，比九月份减少百分之零点一；美元存款三千零八十一亿港元，比上月增加百分之二点五；其它外币存款二千七百六十六亿港元，增加百分之四点二。
    专家认为，外币存款增长快的原因主要是目前多数外币存款的利率都高于港币利率。同时，投资者既即可选存高息货币，又可选存强势货币。
