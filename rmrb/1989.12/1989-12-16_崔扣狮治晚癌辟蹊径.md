A Case Study: Zhang Ailing, a 25-year-old female worker from the Shanxi Yuncheng Electric Power Bureau, discovered a lump in her left breast in October 1981 and was diagnosed with "fibroadenoma of the breast." After surgical removal, the wound did not heal for over 40 days, and a pathological biopsy confirmed "squamous cell carcinoma of the breast." Thirty days after a radical mastectomy, a new lump appeared at the original site, requiring a third surgery. Within half a year, another walnut-sized lump appeared, making further surgery impossible and radiotherapy ineffective. In August 1982, she sought treatment at the Shanxi Yuncheng Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, where the hospital director, Cui Koulion, treated her. Cui Koulion applied A3 blood-stasis resolving plaster and prescribed "anti-cancer tonic soup" based on her condition. Twenty-eight days later, the wound healed, and she was discharged. In 1984, she got married during the National Day celebrations, and in August 1985, she gave birth to a son. She is now in good health and working normally.

Cui Koulion, following the principles of "activating blood and resolving stasis," "strengthening the body and expelling pathogens," "using toxins to combat toxins," and "nourishing yin, clearing heat, and detoxifying," has developed a series of anti-cancer Chinese herbal compound ointments and oral medications. Over the past decade, he has treated over 7,000 patients with advanced cancer, achieving over 90% effectiveness.

    崔扣狮治晚癌辟蹊径
    一个病例：张爱玲，女，25岁，山西运城电业局工人。1981年10月发现左乳有肿块确诊“乳腺纤维瘤”。手术切除后，40余天伤口不愈合病理切片确诊为“乳腺鳞状细胞癌”。乳房根除术后30天原部位又长肿块，作第三次手术。不足半载，又出核桃大肿块，已不能再手术，放疗也效果不佳。1982年8月到山西运城中医医院接受该院院长崔扣狮诊治。崔扣狮给她贴敷A3化淤膏并辨证加服“抗癌大补汤”。28天后伤口愈合出院。1984年国庆结婚，1985年8月生一男孩，她身体健康，正常工作。
    崔扣狮以“活血化淤”、“扶正却邪”、“以毒攻毒”、“养阴清热解毒”为基本原则，研制了系列抗癌中药复方药膏和口服剂，近10年来已对7000余例晚期癌症患者进行辨证施治，90％以上有效。
