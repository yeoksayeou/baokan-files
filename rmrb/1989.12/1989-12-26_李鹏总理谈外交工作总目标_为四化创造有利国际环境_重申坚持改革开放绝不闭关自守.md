Premier Li Peng on the Overall Goal of Diplomatic Work
Creating a Favorable International Environment for the Four Modernizations
Reaffirming the Commitment to Reform and Opening Up, Absolutely Not Closing the Door to the World

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25 (Reporters He Ping, Yang Zi Di) Premier Li Peng recently stated at a meeting with representatives of the National Conference of Local Foreign Affairs Offices that China adheres to the policy of reform and opening up and will absolutely not close its doors to the world. The overall goal of diplomatic work is to create a relatively favorable international environment for China's Four Modernizations.

At the meeting, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Nan and foreign affairs officials from Beijing, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, and other provinces and municipalities reported to Premier Li Peng on the situation of the conference and local foreign affairs work.

After listening to the reports, Li Peng pointed out that 1989 was a year of turbulent international changes, with many developments occurring around the world. However, regardless of how the international situation changes, China will consistently continue to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and value friendly cooperation with developing countries. At the same time, China will unswervingly implement the policy of opening up to the outside world. These four points constitute the important content of China's diplomatic policy.

Li Peng said that to achieve the Four Modernizations, China needs to engage in extensive international exchanges, including economic, trade, and technological exchanges, and learn advanced science and technology and management experience from countries around the world. However, while implementing the policy of opening up, we must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and maintain a clear mind in the face of the complex international situation.

In his speech, Li Peng affirmed the achievements of local foreign affairs work. He pointed out that local foreign affairs work is a part of the country's foreign affairs work, and major foreign-related matters should be reported to the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Local Party committees and governments should pay attention to local foreign affairs work and strengthen the leadership of local foreign affairs work.

When talking about the policy on studying abroad, Li Peng said that sending students abroad is a part of China's opening-up policy and will continue in the future. However, we must also seriously summarize the experiences and lessons, and make real improvements. In the future, when sending students abroad, we should adhere to the principle of emphasizing quality, meeting needs, and ensuring that study and use are consistent, selecting outstanding talents with both moral integrity and ability to study abroad, and better serving the motherland.

Li Peng also specially emphasized the issue of clean governance in foreign affairs work. He said that in foreign affairs reception work, we must also adhere to the principles of hard work, thrift, and efficiency, and oppose extravagance and waste. When sending delegations abroad, we should advocate for small, efficient, and effective teams.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Ding Guanggen, Secretary-General of the State Council Luogan, Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen, and Director of the State Council's Foreign Affairs Office Liu Shuoqing attended the meeting.

The six-day-long Fourth National Conference of Local Foreign Affairs Office Directors concluded today.

    李鹏总理谈外交工作总目标
    为四化创造有利国际环境
    重申坚持改革开放绝不闭关自守
    新华社北京12月25日电（记者何平、杨子迪）国务院总理李鹏日前在同出席全国地方外办主任会议代表座谈时指出，中国坚持改革开放政策，绝不闭关自守。外交工作的总目标，就是为我国的四化建设创造一个比较有利的国际环境。
    座谈会上，外交部副部长周南和来自北京、广东、黑龙江、上海等省市外办负责人，向李鹏总理汇报了本次会议及地方外事工作的情况。
    李鹏在听取汇报后指出，1989年国际风云多变，世界上发生了许多变化。但不管国际形势发生什么样的变化，中国都将始终如一地继续奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持和平共处五项原则，重视同发展中国家的友好合作关系。同时坚定不移地实行对外开放政策。这四点构成了中国外交方针的重要内容。
    李鹏说，中国要实现四化，需要进行包括经济、贸易和科技交流在内的广泛的国际交往，需要向世界各国学习先进的科学技术和管理经验。但在实行对外开放的同时，必须坚持四项基本原则，在错综复杂的国际形势面前，保持清醒的头脑。
    李鹏在讲话中肯定了地方外事工作的成绩。他指出，地方外事工作是国家外事工作的组成部分，重大涉外事项要请示党中央和国务院。地方党委和政府要关心地方外事工作，加强对地方外事工作的领导。
    在谈到留学生政策时，李鹏说，派遣留学生是我国对外开放政策的一个组成部分，今后还要继续派遣，但同时也要认真总结经验教训，切实加以改进。今后派遣留学人员时要本着注重质量，根据需要，学用一致的原则，选择德才兼备的优秀人才出国留学，更好地为祖国服务。
    李鹏还特别强调了外事工作中的廉政建设问题。他说，在外事接待工作中，也要坚持艰苦奋斗、勤俭办事的原则，反对铺张浪费奢侈现象。派团出访要提倡短小精干，讲求实效。
    国务院副总理吴学谦，中共中央政治局候补委员丁关根，国务院秘书长罗干，外交部部长钱其琛，国务院外办主任刘述卿等出席了座谈会。
    历时6天的第四次全国地方外办主任会议，于今天在这里结束。
