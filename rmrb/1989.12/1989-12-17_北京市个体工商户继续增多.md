The number of individual industrial and commercial households in Beijing continues to increase. By the end of November, the number had reached over 120,000 households. This is an increase of 170,000 households compared to the end of 1988, and an increase of 1,473 households compared to the end of June this year.

Additionally, it is understood that from January to November this year, the business revenue of individual economies in Beijing has reached 2.25 billion yuan, which is also a significant increase compared to the same period last year.

A responsible person from the Beijing Individual Laborers Association analyzed that this situation indicates that society needs individual industrial and commercial households, and that the policies of the Party and the government towards individual industrial and commercial businesses have not changed. This person said that since this year, leaders in Beijing have repeatedly emphasized that the rectification and adjustment are not aimed at eliminating individual households; individual households still need to be developed. This has given the practitioners of individual economies a sense of security.

    北京市个体工商户继续增多
    新华社北京十二月十六日电　（记者阎振国）北京市个体工商户继续增多。到十一月底止已达十二万多户。比一九八八年底增加了一点七万户，比今年六月底增加一千四百七十三户。
    另据了解，今年一至十一月北京市个体经济的营业额已达二十二点五亿元，比去年同期也有较大增加。
    北京市个体劳动者协会负责人分析，这个情况说明社会发展需要个体工商户，党和政府对个体工商业的政策也没有变。这位负责人说，今年以来，北京市的领导同志多次强调，治理整顿不是要整顿掉个体户，个体户还是要发展的。这使个体经济的从业人员吃了“定心丸”。
