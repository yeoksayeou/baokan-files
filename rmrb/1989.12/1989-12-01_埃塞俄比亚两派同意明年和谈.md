The second round of preliminary peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, an anti-government group, concluded in Nairobi on the 29th. Both sides agreed to hold formal talks in early next year.

The final communiqué issued by both sides in Nairobi on the 29th stated that former Tanzanian President Nyerere was elected as co-chairman, along with the mediator, former U.S. President Carter, to jointly preside over the formal peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.

Both sides also selected seven observers to supervise the formal peace talks: the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Tanzania, Sudan, and Kenya.
