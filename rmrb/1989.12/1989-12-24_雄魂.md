The Spirit of Heroism

"Even if we drain the blue waves of the Bohai Sea and splash the ink-like waves of the Yellow River, we cannot exhaust the heroic spirit of the black land of the delta..." Here, the poet's song of praise for the "heroic spirit" is for the spirits of the tens of thousands of energy warriors of the Binhai Oil Field. The Binhai Oil Field is the largest oil extraction field of the Shengli Oil Field, located on the vast wilderness near the mouth of the Yellow River.

The Yellow River, at its mouth, uses the rolling silt it carries to add 30 square kilometers of land to the sea each year, creating this youngest black land of the Republic. Over the past decade, oil workers have planted 2,800 "oil trees" on this black land, in the embrace of the Yellow River and the Bohai Sea.

A winding sea dike, like a sleeping dragon, stretches out. He walked along it, with blue eyes, a high nose, and frost-white temples... From the western hemisphere across the ocean, 73-year-old Salisbury, wearing large boots, walked briskly. He had once followed the path of the Red Army 50 years ago and written a book for the world, "The Long March - An Unprecedented Story." Now, he stood on the high sea dike, facing the sea, his keen eyes gazing at the oil trees standing in the coastal area and the advancing Binhai Oil Field. Accompanying him, Shengli Oil Field's Chief Commander Zhu Wenke pointed and answered his questions: "Here, the speed of the Yellow River's silt filling the sea is limited. A year ago, the oil workers drove away the sea and built this long sea dike, taking 200 square kilometers of oil fields from the Dragon King's hands in one go, securing several thousand tons of new production capacity." Commander Zhu's right arm swept forward in a large arc: "Here, including the isolated island and the pile west, that is our Binhai Oil Field. Its crude oil production accounts for 1/12 of the entire country, and it has contributed one billion tons of oil to the country..."

Salisbury's eyes lit up, his gaze falling on the long dike where the waves crashed, his neatly trimmed beard suddenly rising, and he sighed deeply—

"OK. It's like a myth, a true myth!"

"We Chinese do have an ancient myth called 'Jingwei Filling the Sea.'"

In the notebook held in Salisbury's left palm, he recorded the mythical great deeds of the Binhai oil workers, recording the triumphant songs of progress on the new Long March to build a modernized China. He had come to the mouth of the Yellow River specifically to conduct interviews for another book, "The New Long March."

At the mouth of the Yellow River, the national spirit of oil is held high.

The Sacred Fire

In the oil field with 30,000 workers, Mu Shuling, with his sturdy arms, shoulders the responsibilities of both the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director. Three years ago, in that spring, the daily production of the Binhai Factory had dropped by 5,000 tons. Get out of the trough! Mu Shuling, who had just taken office, vowed to turn the situation around that year.

On one hand, he streamlined the work mechanism, and on the other, he organized production operations. During the day, he conducted on-site office work, and at night, he planned production strategies. He supported his tired body, working overtime every day. The car he rode in, in less than a year, had traveled 70,000 kilometers on the wilderness.

He is a graduate of the Petroleum University in the 1960s, and he plays the violin very well. In the past, during his leisure time, under the oil trees, he would pick up his violin and play a tune of "Spring in Xinjiang," feeling very happy. However, this year, not only did he not play the violin, but he did not even have time to joke around. Every month, for 30 days, the production rhythm was tight, and he did not have a day off, except for one Sunday.

Worksite, dispatch room, geological department, oil extraction room... His figure, dressed in a large blue work uniform, could be seen everywhere.

Democratic decision-making, expert forecasting, operational accounting... A series of enterprise management strategies brought about a doubling of production benefits.

His countless efforts and the workers' sweat moved the oil trees. The daily crude oil production miraculously increased, but his body was deteriorating day by day. Long-term overwork, Mu Shuling fell ill from exhaustion.

He once had a robust body like an athlete, but by July and August, he began to feel his strength waning, often experiencing palpitations and headaches, and sometimes his heart would ache like it was being stabbed. When the pain was extreme, his face would turn purple, and sometimes he would have a nosebleed.

Mu Shuling wanted to lie down so badly, even if it was just to catch his breath, but the crude oil production was increasing day by day, and he could not lie down even if he tried. He would rather be "glorified" on the job than give up! He had experienced more than ten life-and-death situations, and it could be said that he had "died nine times and lived once"—

After graduating from university, he was assigned to the oil field operation team. On his first night shift, he encountered a strong well blowout. In the following twenty years of his oil career, he could not remember how many times he had fought and subdued well blowouts, from Well 8-12 in Camp 8 to Well 69-1 in Yong 69, he had already served as the deputy commander and encountered an extremely dangerous well blowout. At any time, there was a possibility of a fire or explosion. Mu Shuling rushed to the most dangerous front line to command the rescue operation. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, CCTV broadcasted the live footage of this special battle.

In the early autumn of 1988, the Binhai Oil Field was hit by eight consecutive Yellow River floods. In the face of the unprecedented large floods in more than a decade, Mu Shuling set up the flood control command post at the forefront again, leading 6,000 flood-fighting heroes to unite as one.

The Yellow River ice floes threatened the Dong Oil Field, and he bravely stepped into the icy water to investigate the flood situation...

How many times had he faced great danger, Mu Shuling calmly faced death again and again, showing a communist's sincere devotion and unwavering belief in his cause.

The crude oil production returned to normal, and his comrades urged him to go to the hospital for treatment with tears in their eyes. The doctor diagnosed: left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, blood lipid levels more than double the normal range, and the electrocardiogram showed "T" wave inversion...

Mu Shuling paid no heed to his own life. Deputy Director Lü Lianhai told me a few small stories about Old Mu donating blood, and his eyes reddened as he spoke. In 1963, he voluntarily donated 200 milliliters of blood in the capital; in 1969, his colleague Xiao Qiu accidentally injured his kidney, and luckily, he saved him with a blood transfusion. In 1970, when a worker's wife, Old Ma, had a difficult childbirth, he voluntarily donated blood. When the baby of a worker, Tian Shengwang, suffered from hemolytic jaundice, he generously donated his own blood. Old Mu donated not just his blood to his colleagues, the pregnant woman, and the sick baby. It was clearly the noble love of a communist and the burning heart of a high-level intellectual.

He appeared to be a practical leader, an image of a "self-sacrificing" entrepreneur, and this characteristic was even more precious in a high-level intellectual cadre.

In fact, he was a managerial leader. His management system, direction, and ideas all showed his style. The success of the Binhai Oil Field was undoubtedly due to the success of management. Production decisions were all made with foresight, and crude oil production over the past three years had run smoothly according to the operating curve compiled at the beginning of the year. Mu Shuling was awarded the title of "Best Decision Maker" in the Binhai Campaign.

He was also a standard cultural leader. Not only did he love to read, but he also initiated the establishment of a "Sunday University" among the leadership of the factory. He studied Russian at university and later self-taught English and French at work. He loves calligraphy and recently has been fascinated by art photography. He plays the violin extremely well and can handle all kinds of instruments in the military band. He wrote a song called "Binhai, the youngest land of the motherland," which was broadcast on the "Song of the Week" program of Shandong People's Radio and was also featured as a special program in the 1989 Spring Festival Gala. In the first Shengli Oil Field Song Competition, it was awarded the first prize.

The song cassette "Devoted Binhai," published by the China Audio and Video Publishing House, was selected this summer as one of the ten excellent cassettes and sent to the central leaders. The songs on this cassette were created by the workers of the Binhai Oil Field, showcasing the shining beliefs and great aspirations of the people of Binhai. Mu Shuling, as the producer and main lyricist of the cassette, told me that the purpose of making the cassette was to cultivate and promote the enterprise spirit and inspire the pride of all the workers in the factory to dedicate themselves to Binhai. His ideas and methods were always different from others.

Mu Shuling stood on the long sea dike, facing the vast mouth of the Yellow River, and picked up his beloved violin. However, this time, he played not the bright and elegant "Spring in Xinjiang," but the powerful and uplifting "The Yellow River Flows Through My Doorstep," which he composed himself. As the song goes, "The sacred light of petroleum energy," it is sung so well. "Sacred light" is the light of the "sacred fire." Our ancestors called petroleum "sacred fire," which adds warmth to the land of China and brings vitality, light, and progress to mankind! Mu Shuling and his colleagues, these oil workers who silently dedicate themselves in the wilderness, are they not adding a glimmer of the sacred fire to the glory of the Republic's petroleum industry?

The Couple's Well

On the remote wilderness of the Yellow River Delta, there are 206 scattered oil wells that are particularly remote. The oil field sends out couples to live and manage the wells year-round, and oil workers call these types of wells "couple's wells."

Do not underestimate these couple's wells. They produce 1,600 tons of crude oil per day, with an annual output of over 550,000 tons, equivalent to the annual output of a Yumen Oil Field.

The Binhai Oil Field has 17 couple's wells.

Crossing the Yellow River and heading straight north to the end of the wilderness, you will reach the old Well 13, located in the old course of the Yellow River.

A remote well, a wooden house, three sides facing the sea, and one side facing the wilderness. I came to the old Well 13 for an interview. The hostess is named Jia Hengfen, a hardworking and simple girl from the Yimeng Mountains. I had a conversation with her:

"Is it hard?" "At first, it felt very hard, but now I am used to it. Not to mention the frequent encounters with tornadoes and sea tides, sandstorms covering the sky are common in the wilderness. On bad weather days, when it rains continuously, the car that brings oil and supplies cannot come in, and we have to eat dry bread with soy sauce. I heard that one winter, after a heavy snow, a relatively remote couple's well ran out of living water, and the family had to melt snow for water and ate more than a mile of accumulated snow."

"How is the production?" "It's okay. This is a meritorious well, producing with a 6mm oil nozzle, and it produces more than 50 tons of crude oil a day. No matter how hard and tired it is, as soon as you approach it (pointing to the oil well), and hear the sound of oil flowing and spouting, it is particularly pleasant, and it feels good in the heart."

"Are there any difficulties?" "The mine leadership cares about us very much, and they have installed a wireless radio for us. During the holidays, they always remember to visit us. I remember one day in early June, it was very hot and humid. The performers of the oil field art troupe came here and performed a special show for us two. If you talk about the audience, there were only the two of us. They sang, and I cried excitedly. The performance lasted for an hour, and I cried for an hour. However, no matter how big the difficulties are, they are not scary. It's just too lonely. Look at the colleagues on the couple's wells, every family has dogs, cats, and a group of chickens. This kind of loneliness is scary. Adults can endure it for a while, but children cannot."

Her gaze suddenly fell on the child in her arms. The only child, ShaSha, who grew up in the wilderness, was not yet two years old, and her only playmate was the little dog that her parents raised. One night, little ShaSha looked at the pictures in the children's book, jumping and playing, and cried and demanded to find children to play with. The dark wilderness, where could there be other families! There was no way, so her father, Zhang Zhenyong, led little ShaSha following the fishing lights on the sea, chasing the ships moored by the shore, with the sound of the wind blowing the wild grass behind them.

The first time her mother took her out of the wilderness to a town several dozen kilometers away to do some business, she looked at the big trees on both sides of the street in confusion. In the wilderness that belonged to ShaSha, there were only tall reeds and wild grass, but no trees. She pointed to the big tree by the road and asked her mother, "Hey, why are the grasses here so tall?" A sentence that made her mother's eyes fill with tears.

That night, the tide suddenly rose, and the fierce waves surged in, the cold sea wind made the sky and earth freezing, and the couple could not close their eyes. They got out of the warm bed, wrapped in the cold moonlight, and patrolled the well without interruption. On windy days, if the flame in the heating furnace was extinguished, it was easy to cause the oil pipeline to freeze. The oil workers called this "sausage filling." The couple's well they managed had never had "sausage filling." The couple had endured many cold nights in the open air!

I roughly calculated an account. The couple's well they managed produced 18,000 tons of oil per year, with a production value of over 20 million yuan, equivalent to the benefits of a not-small factory. The couple devoted themselves to the oil well, shedding so much blood and sweat, but they never had any expectations.

This is a portrayal of the life of a couple on a wilderness well, and it is also a model for the 10,000 Binhai oil workers. It is these Jia Hengfen and Zhang Zhenyong who form the backbone of the Republic's energy industry.

The Heartbeat

The mouth of the Yellow River is like a vast stage, playing a powerful and majestic symphony, with each movement blending the moments of the Binhai oil extraction battle.

No, it is not just a symphony, but also the heartbeat of the Binhai oil workers' dedication, which comes from the heart of every dedicator.

The sky was murky, and the rain poured down. Several people, soaked in mud and water, carried heavy loads and walked forward, shouting, "Heave-ho, heave-ho," slipping one step at a time... The 519th Operation Team took on the task of repairing an oil well. On rainy days, the car carrying the equipment could not enter the well site, and several comrades from the team carried a 400-kilogram deep well pump to a well two miles away.

The 519th Operation Team of Binhai has an average effective operation rate of 96.7% over eight years. In 1982 and 1983, it was awarded the title of "High-Quality and High-Efficiency Operation Team" by the Petroleum Industry, and since 1984, it has won consecutive awards and was named the "Gold Medal Operation Team." They never stop, and they are striding towards the new goal of "six consecutive championships."

The highlight of the 519th Operation Team is to raise the quality of operations to the level of professional ethics. As oil workers, the masters of the country, the spirit of selfless dedication should be specifically reflected in producing more oil for the country, not just chasing after ineffective work volume to earn a little more bonus.

In early March, a heavy snowstorm caused a large-scale power outage, and all the oil wells stopped. The 14 workers of the 519th Operation Team, who were on rest, rushed to the well site in the wind and snow upon hearing the news and actively assisted the oil workers in opening the wells. Within half an hour, 76 wells were opened.

Team leader Tian Jiabao told me: "The job of an operation worker is to fix the oil wells, and as the 'doctor' of the oil wells, it is good to advocate professional ethics; our next goal is 'six consecutive championships,' and only by aiming for a team championship for Shengli Oil Field or even the petroleum industry, our 'six consecutive championships' will be solid and reliable."

The water flow of the flood was 1,410 cubic meters per second to 4,800, 4,990, 5,660 cubic meters... In July and August, eight Yellow River floods rushed to Binhai, each one more ferocious and violent than the last.

The Yellow River's muddy waves rolled and moaned, rampaging out of the riverbed, trampling over the wild grass, and rushing towards the outer perimeter of the oil field's wave-breaking dam. In one night, eight wells in the Dong Oil Field were surrounded by floodwaters, seriously threatening the safety of the Binhai area.

The Binhai Oil Field quickly mobilized 6,000 "elite troops" to fight against the flood and rescue the situation. The wells that were flooded still insisted on production.

The third oil extraction team, in the ten days they were surrounded by floodwaters, did not miss taking any data, and not a single oil well stopped production. They produced over 600 tons of crude oil per day, and the production not only did not decrease, but also increased steadily.

This seemingly ordinary number hides the price paid by the oil workers. One day, Wang Renquan from the 5th station was patrolling the wells in a rubber boat when he suddenly encountered a storm. The fierce wind capsized the small boat, and Wang Renquan, who did not know how to swim, was hit by the waves and submerged. The muddy water choked him, and he could not breathe. A survival instinct drove him to struggle with all his limbs, and he finally broke free from the deep water. After the storm, Wang Renquan, fearless, bravely went with his colleagues to adjust the oil well parameters in the water.

There is a legendary figure—Zhao Huaxi, a model communist party member famous in Binhai. He is the political instructor of the operation team that has been awarded the "All-Round Team" title three times in a row. He has spent five consecutive Spring Festivals with the workers in the well site and has not taken a leave of absence for five years.

Once, during a cement plugging operation, the cement in the pool was difficult to dissolve and clumped together. Forcing it into the well could block the pipeline or cause the pump to stop working. Zhao Huaxi jumped into the cement pool without a word, as calm as if he were entering a bath. He bent over, using his hands and feet to stir continuously, turning the clumps at the bottom of the pool into a fluffy state, and then stirring it into a uniform consistency. The cement mixed with his sweat dripped into the thousand-meter-deep underground palace.

Zhao Huaxi in the cement pool was covered in mud and water, and his arms and legs were gradually turning into a "mud sculpture." His skin had been corroded by alkali.

"Mud sculpture"—a true statue of a communist.

On the podium, there were large and small charts hanging, and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Jiang Jiamin pointed to the keyboard-like hanging charts, playing the symphony of Binhai's future. He was giving a lecture to the students of the "Sunday University" on the topic of "Current Situation and Future Planning of Binhai Mine Construction." He entered the factory in 1971 and grew up in Binhai. He had a special affection for Binhai. The beautiful blueprint of Binhai's future, as he narrated, was so enchanting and so real and believable that many people listened and decided to take root in Binhai.

Young Binhai has entered a period of comprehensive development. Last year, it was awarded the title of "Double Civilization Unit" in Shandong Province.

Education: Established the "Care for the Next Generation Association," with the number of college entrance examinees rising from zero to 56 in 1989. Agriculture and sideline production: Mobilized family members to develop wasteland, producing 17 million jin of grain this year, 230,000 jin of shrimp, and 400,000 jin of fish... Agricultural and sideline products are self-sufficient. Staff life: Moved from the temporary houses of the campaign period to spacious residential buildings. Supply of living goods: Dual-income families are on the "8642" system, which means supplying 8 jin of eggs, 6 jin of meat, 4 jin of fish, and 2 jin of cooking oil per month, equivalent to a two-level wage increase...

The symphony continues on the vast stage at the mouth of the Yellow River. These few short movements are not enough to encompass the whole, but as long as you listen carefully, you will always feel the pure and sincere "heartbeat" of the oil workers in the movements.

专栏：国庆报告文学征文

    雄魂
    周洪成
    “纵然汲干渤海湾蓝色的波涛／挥洒黄河泼墨般的浪峰／也塑不尽三角洲黑土地上的雄魂……”这里，诗人放歌赞颂的“雄魂”，就是滨海采油厂的上万名能源战士之魂。滨海采油厂是胜利油田最大的采油厂，坐落在黄河入海口畔辽远的荒原上。
    黄河在入海口处，用它携带的滚滚泥沙每年填海造陆30平方公里，造就了这块共和国最年轻的黑土地。十几年间，石油工人在这块黑土地上，在黄河和渤海相拥抱的臂弯里，栽下了2800个“采油树”。
    一条蜿若卧龙的海堤上，他走来了，蓝眼、高鼻、如霜的鬓发……从大洋彼岸的西半球，73岁的索尔兹伯里足蹬大头靴，步履矫健地走来了。他曾沿着50年前红军走过的路，写下了一本属于世界的书——《长征——前所未有的故事》。此刻，他驻足于高高的海堤上，背向大海，敏锐的目光投向海滨林立的采油树，投向奋进中的滨海采油厂。陪同他的胜利油田总指挥朱文科同志，不住地用手指点着，回答着他的提问：“这里，黄河泥沙填海造陆的速度毕竟有限，一年前，石油工人赶走了大海，筑起这道长长的海堤，从海龙王的手心里一下就抠出了200平方公里的油区，拿下了几千吨的新建产能。”朱指挥伸向前方的右臂划了一个大圆弧：“这里，连同孤岛、桩西，也就是我们的滨海采油厂，它的原油产量，占全中国的1／12，已向国家奉献了一亿吨石油……”
    索翁听到这里，眼睛一亮，目光落在海浪拍击的长堤上，修剪齐整的胡髭猛然翘起，慨然长叹——
    “ OK。简直像是神话，一个真实的神话！”
    “我们中国倒是真有一则古代神话，叫做‘精卫填海’。”
    索翁托在左手掌上的采访本里，记录下滨海石油人神话般的伟业，记录下建设现代化中国的新长征路上奋进的凯歌。他是专程来黄河入海口，为写作另一本书《新长征》进行采访的。
    黄河口上，高擎起民族的石油魂。
    圣火
    在三万人的采油大厂，牟书令用坚实的臂膀，一头肩负着党委书记的职责，一头肩起厂长的重任。3年前的那个春天，滨海厂日产量曾下跌5000吨。走出低谷！到任不久的牟书令发誓要在当年打个翻身仗。
    一方面理顺工作机制，一方面组织生产运行，白天现场办公，晚间运筹增产对策，他支撑着疲倦的身体，每天都在超负荷劳作。他乘坐的那部汽车，不足一年，在荒原上奔驰了7万公里。
    他是60年代的石油大学毕业生，小提琴拉得很出色，过去工余小憩，采油树下，操起小提琴拉上一曲《新疆之春》，其乐陶陶。然而，这一年莫说是操琴，就连说笑的一点闲暇也没有，每月30天的每一刻钟，生产节奏都是紧张的，不过节假日，也不过一个礼拜天。
    工地、调度室、地质所、采油房……随处可见他身着一件肥大的蓝色工装奔波的身影。
    民主决策、专家预测、经营测算……一连串企业经营管理方略，带来的是生产效益的翻番。
    他的无数心血和工人的涔涔血汗感动了采油树。原油日产量奇迹般地上升，他自己的身体却一天一天的垮下去了。长期超负荷工作，牟书令积劳成疾。
    他曾经拥有运动员般的健壮体魄，可到了7、8月间，开始明显感觉到体力不支，常常心悸头胀，心脏有时锥扎般的阵痛，痛极了，脸色发紫，有时鼻血直流。
    牟书令多么想就此躺下，哪怕是缓上一口气也好，然而，原油产量正在节节上升，他再下大决心也躺不住呀。宁可“光荣”在岗位上，也要挺住！他经历过十数次生与死的考验，也可说是“九死一生”了——
    大学毕业，他分到油田作业队里，头一个夜班便遭遇强烈井喷。以后的二十载石油生涯他记不清多少次参战制服井喷，从营8—12井到永69—1井，他已担任副指挥，又遇异常险恶的井喷，随时都有可能起火爆炸，牟书令冲向最危险的前沿阵地指挥抢险。国庆四十周年之际，中央电视台播放了这一特殊战斗的实况镜头。
    1988年初秋，滨海采油厂接连遭受8次黄河洪峰的侵袭，在十几年未遇的特大洪峰面前，牟书令又是把抗洪指挥所设在最前沿，带领6000名抗洪勇士众志成城。
    黄河冰凌威逼孤东油田，又是他奋不顾身，踩着冰水探查汛情……
    多少回大难临头，牟书令坦然地一回又一回置生死于不顾，表现了一个共产党人对事业的一腔赤诚和执著的信念。
    原油生产走上正轨，同志们含着热泪催促他住进医院治疗。医生诊断：左心室肥大，冠状动脉病变，血脂超出正常人一倍多，心电图反映“T”波倒置……
    牟书令对自己的生命毫不顾惜。副厂长吕连海，跟我谈了老牟献血的几个小故事，谈着眼圈就红了。1963年他在首都义务献血200毫升；1969年工友小崔不慎被击伤肾脏，幸亏他输血相救。1970年一位工人师傅老马的爱人生产时大出血，他主动献血，田升旺的婴孩患缺血性黄疸又是他慷慨献上自己的鲜血。老牟一次次向工友、产妇、病婴献上的仅仅是自己的一份鲜血吗？那分明是一个共产党人崇高的爱，一颗高级知识分子滚烫的心。
    他看上去是一位实干型领导，一种“舍身成仁”的创业者形象，这种特点在一位高级知识分子出身的干部身上表现出来就尤为可贵了。
    其实，他是一位管理型领导，他的管理体系、管理方向、管理思路都显示了他的风格。滨海采油厂的成功，毫无疑问，首先得力于管理上的成功。生产决策项项具备超前意识，原油生产三年来按年初编制的运行曲线，正点运行。牟书令获滨海会战“最佳决策者”称号。
    他又是一位标准的文化型领导，不仅自己爱读书，还在厂内领导层倡议开办了“星期日大学”。他在大学学的是俄语，后来工作中自学了英语和法语。他爱好书法，近来又迷上了艺术摄影，小提琴拉得极出色，军乐队的各式家伙儿他样样耍得来。他执笔写了一首歌曲《滨海，祖国最年轻的土地》，山东人民广播电台“每周一歌”节目播放，并于1989年春节文艺晚会作为特别节目推出，胜利油田首届石油歌曲比赛，被评为特等奖。
    中国录音录像出版总社出版发行的歌曲盒带《奉献的滨海》，今年夏天，作为十盘优秀盒带之一，被选送到中央领导同志的手中，这盘盒带中的歌曲就是滨海采油厂工人们自己创作的，展示滨海人的闪光信念和远大抱负。牟书令作为盒带的监制和主要词作者，告诉我制作盒带的目的在于培植、弘扬企业精神，焕发全厂职工献身滨海的自豪感。他的思路和做法总是与众不同。
    牟书令驻足于那道长长的海堤上，面向坦荡的黄河入海口，拉起了他心爱的小提琴，不过，这一次拉的曲子不是明快优雅的《新疆之春》，而是激越昂扬的、他自己的得意之作《黄河从我门前流过》。正如歌中唱道“石油能源的圣光”，唱得多好，“圣光”便是“圣火之光”，我们的祖先曾把石油唤做“圣火”，是圣火给神州添温加热，是圣火，给人类带来活力、光明和飞跃！牟书令和他的工友们，这些在荒原上默默奉献的石油人，不也是为共和国石油工业的辉煌，添加着一丝丝光明的圣火吗？
    夫妻井
    黄河三角洲边远的荒原上，零零星星分布着206座特别偏远的油井，油田派出一对对夫妻长年住井、管井，石油工人管这类井叫做“夫妻井”。
    别小觑了这些夫妻井，日产原油1600吨，年产量在55万吨以上，相当于一个玉门油田的年产量。
    滨海采油厂有夫妻井17座。
    过了黄河，一直往北走，走到荒原的尽头，便是地处黄河故道的老13井。
    一座远井，一间板房，三面临海，背向荒原。我来到了老13井采访，女主人叫贾恒芬，是一位从沂蒙山来的山妹子，勤恳朴实。我与她进行了一番交谈：
      “苦不苦呢？”“开始觉得很苦，现在习惯了。且不说经常遭受龙卷风和海潮的侵袭，荒原上大风沙铺天揭地那是家常便饭，碰上孬天气阴雨连绵，拉原油捎带着送点粮菜的车进不来，蘸酱油啃干馍是常有的事儿。听说有一年深冬，大雪过后，一座较为荒僻的夫妻井上断了生活用水，一家人只得化雪水喝，吃掉一里多地的积雪。”
      “产量咋样？”“还行，这是口功勋井，用6毫米油嘴生产，一天出50多吨原油。再苦再累，一走近它（指油井），听见油流突突地喷吐声，格外动听，心里美气极了。”
      “有困难吗？”“矿上领导对我们很关心，给装上了无线电报话机，逢年过节总忘不了看望我们。记得6月初的一天，好闷热，油田文工团的演员们来到这里，单独为俺两口子慰问演出，要说观众啊就只有俺夫妻俩。人家演员们唱，俺激动地哭，演出了个把钟头，俺哭了个把钟头。话又说回来，困难再大倒没啥可怕的，只是太寂寞了。你瞧夫妻井上的工友们，家家都养着狗、猫，喂上一群鸡。这可怕的寂寞之苦，大人忍上一忍还能受得住，孩子受不了呀。”
    她的目光一下子落在她怀里的孩子身上。在荒原上成长的独生女莎莎不满两周岁，唯一的小伙伴就是父母喂养的那条小狗。一天晚上，小莎莎看着小人书上又蹦又跳的小朋友，便哭着闹着要找小孩玩一玩，漆黑的荒野，哪有别的人家！没办法，爸爸张在勇领着小莎莎循着海上的渔火，追赶着岸边停靠的船只，身后风吹野草发出飒飒声响。
    妈妈第一次领她走出荒原，到几十公里外的镇上办事，她望着街道两旁的大树迷惑不解，荒原上那属于莎莎的天地里，只有丛生的芦苇、野草，没有一棵树，她指着路旁的大树问妈妈：“咦，这儿的草为啥长得这么高呀？”一句话问得妈妈眼里盈满泪花。
    那一夜忽然涨潮，凶猛的潮水汹涌而至，冰冷的海风搅得天寒地冻，小两口再也合不上眼了，钻出热烘烘的被窝，身披清冷的月辉，不间断地来回巡井。大风天，加温炉里火苗一旦被刮灭，容易造成输油管线冻结，采油工人称之为“灌香肠”。他们管理的这口夫妻井，从没有“灌香肠”。夫妻俩露天巡井熬过了多少个冰冷的寒夜呀！
    我大略算了一笔帐，他们夫妻俩管理的这口井，一年产油1.8万多吨，折合产值200多万元，相当于一座不小的工厂的效益。小两口一心扑在油井上，抛洒下几多血汗，却从不抱有一点奢望。
    这是荒原井站夫妻生活的写照，也是万名滨海采油工人的典范，正是一个个贾恒芬张在勇们，组成了共和国能源工业的脊梁。
    心韵
    黄河口像一个巨大的舞台，奏鸣着一曲威武雄壮的交响，那一个个乐章，融汇了滨海人采油会战中的一个个瞬间。
    不，那不仅是交响，也是滨海采油人奉献的心韵，它出自每一个奉献者的心田。
    天色混沌，大雨哗哗下着，几个泥水淋淋的人负重行进，“吭唷、吭唷”的喊着号子，一步一滑地往前走……作业519队接下一口油井的修井任务，雨天运设备的车进不了井场，班上的几名同志硬是将400斤重的深井泵，抬到二里地外的井上。
    滨海作业519队，8年平均作业有效率达96.7％，1982年和1983年获得石油部“优质高效作业队”称号，1984年以来连续获奖，荣膺“金牌作业队”称号。他们一刻也不停步，又向新的目标——“六连冠”迈进。
    作业519队的曝光点，是把作业质量提高到职业道德的高度来认识。石油工人作为国家的主人翁，自觉奉献的精神，应具体体现在为国家多出油上，不应一味地追求无效工作量，以求多得一点奖金。
    3月初，一场大风雪造成大面积停电，油井全停了，作业519队倒休的14名工人闻讯后，顶着风雪跑到井上，主动协助采油工人一起开井，半小时内开起来76口井。
    队长田家宝对我说：“作业工人的职业就是修好油井，身为油井的‘大夫’，提倡职业道德有啥不好；我们下一个目标是‘六连冠’，只有着眼于胜利油田乃至石油工业能拿上一个团体冠军，我们的‘六连冠’才是结结实实的。”
    洪水流量每秒1410立方米到4800、4990、5660立方米……7、8月间，8次黄河洪峰急急地抵达滨海，一次比一次来得狂野和凶猛。
    黄河浊浪，翻卷着，呜咽着，肆虐地涌出河床，压过荒草，直扑油田外围的挡浪大坝。一夜间，孤东矿有8口油井被洪水围困，严重威胁着滨海一带的安全。
    滨海采油厂火速抽调6000“精兵”，奋起抗洪抢险。遭淹的一批井站仍坚持生产。
    采油三队，在被洪水围困的十几天里，没有漏取一次资料，没有一口油井停产，日产原油600多吨，产量不仅斤两未减，还稳中有升。
    这平平常常的数字里，疑结着采油工人的多少代价啊。一天，5号站的王仁全划着橡皮船巡井途中，突遇风暴，狂风卷翻了小船，不谙水性的王仁全被浪头砸入水底，浊水呛得他喘不过气来，一种求生的本能，驱使他四肢拚命扑腾，终于挣脱了深水。风暴过后，王仁全毫不畏惧，又毅然和工友们一起涉水搞油井调参。
    有一位传奇式的人物——赵华西，一位名扬滨海的模范共产党员。他是连续三次被授予“全能队”称号的作业队的指导员，他连续5个春节和工人一起在井场上度过，连续5年没休探亲假。
    一次搞水泥封堵作业，池子里的水泥难以溶化，胶结成团状，强行注入井里，有可能堵塞管线，或是卡泵停工。赵华西一声不响地跳进水泥池子，平静得像是下浴池。他躬着腰，手脚并用搅拌不止，将沉于池底的团状物，搅成絮状，又搅得稀稠均匀，水泥和着他的汗珠，汩汩注入千米深的地宫。
    水泥池子里的赵华西一身的泥水，眼见着渐渐化为“泥塑”。他的胳膊、腿脚被碱蚀掉了一层皮。
    “泥塑”——一个真正共产党人的塑像。
    讲坛上，挂满了大的小的图表，党委副书记蒋洁敏指点着琴键似的挂图，弹奏着滨海未来的交响。他在给“星期日大学”的学员们上课，讲题是“滨海矿区建设现状及远景规划”。他是1971年入厂，在滨海成长起来的青年干部，对滨海别有一番深情。滨海未来的美好蓝图，经他娓娓道来如此迷人，如此实在、可信，不少人听了，铁心要扎根滨海。
    年轻的滨海进入全面发展时期。去年被授予“山东省双文明单位”称号。
    教育事业：成立了“关心下一代协会”，高考升学人数由零上升到1989年的56名。农副业：发动家属开发荒滩，今年生产粮食1700万斤，大虾23万斤、鱼40万斤……农副产品自给有余。职工生活：由会战时期的草房迁入宽敞的住宅楼。生活品供应：双职工家庭为“八六四二”制，即每月供应8斤鸡蛋，6斤肉，4斤鱼，2斤食油，相当于晋升了两级工资……
    黄河入海口的巨大舞台上，交响乐仍在继续着。仅这几个短小的乐章，不足以涵括全体，然而，只要你用心去体味，总会感受到乐章中间石油工人那纯质、赤诚的“心韵”。
