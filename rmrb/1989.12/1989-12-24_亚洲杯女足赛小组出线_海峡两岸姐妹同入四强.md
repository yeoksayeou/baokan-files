The People's Daily, Hong Kong, December 23rd - Reporter Lian Jin Tian reports: The Chinese women's football team tonight defeated Thailand 3-1 in the Asian Cup. With three consecutive victories, they topped Group A. The Chinese Taipei team followed by defeating North Korea with the same score, securing second place in the group and advancing to the semifinals with their mainland sisters.

The Thai women's football team fought tenaciously against China tonight. They had previously won the fifth Asian Cup and, although they have declined in recent years, their players are experienced and have good footwork. The Chinese team did not perform well in the first half, their mood was somewhat anxious, and their key players were tightly marked by the opposition's defense. In the first 30 minutes, they had 10 shots on goal but failed to score, and 3 corner kicks also came to nothing. At the 35-minute mark, a Chinese player committed a foul, and the opponent's number 10, Runee, scored a direct free kick in the penalty area. After conceding a goal, the Chinese team quickly adjusted their tactics, strengthening their interception. In the final 3 minutes of the first half, captain Li Xiu Fu controlled the ball in the penalty area and, instead of rushing to shoot, passed it to number 12, Wen Li Rong, who equalized the score.

The Thai players average only 1.58 meters in height. In the second half, the Chinese team took advantage of their height and long passes, frequently attacking. However, due to the tight defense of the opposing goalkeeper, the Chinese team's 6 shots were all deflected. At the 22-minute mark, number 7, Wu Wei Ying, made a fierce run from midfield, scoring a beautiful direct shot, making it 2-1. At the 30-minute mark, number 14, Zhang Yan, scored another goal. The Chinese team's key to scoring consecutively in the second half was to break through the opponent's tight defense with a concentrated midfield attack, gaining attacking time. The match against Thailand further highlighted the Chinese women's football team's distinctive attacking style, showing a clear advantage in the Asian women's football scene.

    亚洲杯女足赛小组出线
    海峡两岸姐妹同入四强
    本报香港12月23日电　记者连锦添报道：中国女子足球队今晚在亚洲杯赛中，以3∶1战胜泰国队。三战三捷，位居A组第一。中国台北队紧接着以同样比分战胜朝鲜队，名列小组第二，与大陆姐妹携手进入四强。
    泰国女足今晚迎战中国队打得相当顽强。该队曾夺第五届亚洲杯冠军，近年虽然走下坡路，但队员经验丰富，脚法不错。中国队在上半场踢得不甚理想，心情亦较急，主力队员被对方密集防守盯紧，前30分钟10次射门均未破门，3次角球亦无功而返。至35分钟时，中国球员犯规，对方10号瑞妮在禁区罚直接任意球得手。中国队失球之后赶紧调整攻势，加强拦截。在上半场结束前3分钟，队长李秀馥在禁区控球后并不急于踢出，拨给方位更佳的12号温莉蓉射门，扳回一球。
    泰国队员平均身高仅1.58米。下半场中国队以头球、长传的优势，频频进攻，因对方守门员把得紧，中国队6次射门都被化解。至22分钟时，7号吴伟英奋力从中场快攻，急跑中一个漂亮的直射成功，2∶1。30分钟时，14号张岩再攻进一球。中国队下半场连续得分的诀窍是以中场密集攻势打破对方密集防守，赢得进攻时间。中泰一役，更显中国女足有别于人的进攻型球风，在亚洲女足群中优势明显。
