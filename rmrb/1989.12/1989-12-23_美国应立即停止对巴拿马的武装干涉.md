The United States should immediately stop its armed intervention in Panama.

On December 20th, the United States brazenly dispatched troops to invade Panama, using force to interfere in the internal affairs of a Third World sovereign state. This action completely violates the United Nations Charter and international legal norms, and has naturally been met with unanimous condemnation from Latin American countries and the international community.

The United States' armed invasion of Panama has been long planned. Since the political crisis in Panama in 1987, the United States has used political, economic, military, diplomatic, and even assassination methods to arbitrarily interfere in Panama's domestic politics, coercing Panama's Defense Forces Commander Noriega to step down, in order to maintain U.S. strategic interests in the Panama Canal Zone. However, over the past two years, the U.S. plans have not succeeded. In this situation, the United States decided to disregard everything and directly take action, dispatching more than 20,000 troops from the mainland and military bases in Panama to occupy Panama City and the second-largest city, Colón, destroying the headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces, making the situation in Panama extremely serious. The U.S. government repeatedly claims that the purpose of this military action is to "protect the lives of U.S. military and civilians in the area, restore Panama's 'democratic procedures,' and uphold the Panama Canal Treaty," all of which are mere pretexts. The facts show that the United States is pursuing a policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and destroying the territorial sovereignty of other countries. This action by the United States has caused significant casualties among the Panamanian military and civilians. Some Americans who claim to protect "human rights" do not even respect the "national rights" of other countries.

Central America has long been one of the world's hotspots. In a situation where international tensions are easing, relevant countries are seeking to peacefully resolve conflicts in the region through dialogue and consultation, aiming to bring long-term instability in Central America to an end. The U.S. invasion of Panama is not only a gross violation of Panama's sovereignty and territorial integrity but also a threat to the peace and security of the entire Latin America, especially Central America. It is precisely the U.S. policy of interference that has prevented the resolution of conflicts in Central America for so long. Only by stopping interference in the internal affairs of Central America and immediately halting the aggression against Panama can peace and security in the region be restored.

We have always advocated that disputes between countries should be resolved through negotiations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries by any means, especially the use of military force. Whether it is a large country or a small country, they are all equal and should respect the territorial sovereignty of other countries. The use of force, even if successful in the short term, will inevitably leave behind problems that are difficult to resolve. The United States should immediately stop its aggressive actions in Panama, unconditionally withdraw all invading troops from Panama, respect Panama's independence and sovereignty, and resolve disputes between the two countries through negotiations and peaceful means to prevent the situation from escalating further, which is beneficial for the peace, stability, and world peace in Central America.

### 美国应立即停止对巴拿马的武装干涉

    美国应立即停止对巴拿马的武装干涉
    本月二十日，美国悍然派兵入侵巴拿马，对一个第三世界的主权国家使用武力干涉。这一行动完全违反了联合国宪章和国际法准则，理所当然地遭到了拉美国家和国际社会的同声谴责。
    美国这次对巴拿马武装入侵是蓄谋已久的。自从一九八七年巴拿马发生政治危机以来，美国一直采取政治、经济、军事、外交甚至暗杀等各种手段，蛮横地干预巴拿马国内政局，胁迫巴拿马国防军司令诺列加下台，以维护美国在巴拿马运河区的战略利益。可是，两年多来，美国的图谋未能得逞。在这种情况下，美国决定不顾一切，直接动手从本土和驻马拿巴的军事基地出动二万多军队，占领了巴拿马首都和第二大城市科隆，摧垮了巴拿马国防军总部，使巴拿马局势变得极为严重。美国政府口口声声说什么采取这次军事行动的目的是
  “保卫美国驻当地军民的生命安全，恢复巴拿马的‘民主程序’，维护巴拿马运河条约”等等，全是借口。事实说明，美国在巴拿马奉行的是干涉别国内政、破坏别国领土主权的强权政治。美国此举，使巴拿马军民造成很大伤亡，美国某些人口口声声保护“人权”，其实他们连别国的“国权”都不尊重。
    中美洲地区本是世界上的“热点”之一。在国际形势趋向缓和的情况下，有关国家正通过对话和协商，力求和平解决本地区的冲突，使多年来一直动荡不安的中美洲走向和平。美国对巴拿马的入侵，不仅是对巴拿马主权和领土完整的粗暴侵犯，也是对整个拉丁美洲特别是中美洲和平与安全的威胁。正是美国的干涉政策使中美洲地区的冲突长期得不到解决。只有美国停止干涉中美洲内部事务，立即停止对巴拿马的侵略，才有利于恢复中美洲地区的和平与安全。
    我们一向主张，国与国之间的争端应当按照和平共处五项原则通过谈判解决。我们反对以任何借口和方式，特别是使用军事手段干涉别国的内政。不论是大国或小国，都是平等的，都应尊重别国的领土主权。强行使用武力，即使得逞于一时，也必然会留下难以解决的后患。美国应当立即停止对巴拿马的侵略行动，无条件地从巴拿马撤回全部入侵军队，尊重巴拿马的独立和主权，通过谈判用和平手段解决两国争端，防止事态进一步扩大，以利于中美洲地区的和平、稳定与世界和平。
