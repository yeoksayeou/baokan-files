The "International Symposium on Government Administrative Management Reform," co-hosted by the National Institution of Organization and the Ministry of Personnel, was held in Beijing in mid-October this year. Senior officials, experts, and scholars from 14 countries and international organizations, as well as representatives from relevant departments and commissions, some provinces and cities, and some colleges and research institutions in China, attended the conference.

The conference focused on the theme of government administrative management reform, initially introducing the practices and experiences of administrative management reform in various countries. It discussed the development trends, goals, and contents of administrative management reform, government functions, scientific decision-making, and the relationship between central and local governments. It also provided suggestions for China's administrative management reform.

1. **Models and Methods of Administrative Management Reform**: Representatives agreed that with the changing tasks of national management, both developing and developed countries face the challenge of reforming government management. Some representatives summarized three trends: first, emphasizing decentralization and establishing a healthy balance between central and local governments; second, emphasizing the control of public administrative expenditures and the importance of auditing work; third, studying how to improve the quality of administrative services and optimize operational procedures. Representatives believed that different historical backgrounds and economic, political, and cultural conditions necessitate different management models for different countries. Rather than establishing a universally applicable model, it is better to consider the specific situations of each country and choose different models.

2. **Goals and Contents of Administrative Management Reform**: There were different views on the goals of administrative management reform. Some representatives believed that the goal of government administrative management is to pursue administrative efficiency and effectiveness. Others proposed that the main goal of reform is to better serve the public and improve the relationship between public administrative institutions and their service recipients. This is the main trend in the international public administration field in the 1990s.

Regarding the content of reform, some representatives believed that the administrative system refers to the structure of administrative power and its operational methods. The main contents of government administrative management system reform include five aspects: (1) the overall allocation of government functions and the rationalization of administrative organizational structure; (2) the scientificization of administrative decision-making; (3) the perfection of administrative execution and information feedback systems, improving the responsibility system of administrative heads in government departments, and strengthening internal command channels; (4) the quality and structure of government employees; (5) the standardization of administrative behavior and the perfection of administrative operation mechanisms. Other representatives proposed that administrative management system reform includes three aspects: (1) institutional reform, including streamlining institutions and reducing personnel; (2) system reform, including operational procedures and plan execution methods; (3) human resource development. Still, others believed that administrative management system reform includes two parts: one is structural changes, such as authority, streamlining institutions and personnel, and improving administrative procedures, and the other is changes in the behavior of government employees, such as training personnel, reward systems, and the sense of responsibility and independent working ability of government employees.

3. **The Role of Government**: Representatives generally agreed that with the development of the economy and technological revolution, the role of the government is constantly changing. However, there were different views on the trend of this change. Some representatives believed that the government should avoid interfering with the economy and society as much as possible, and government functions should be weakened. The government should decentralize power and give full play to the role of social organizations, rather than suppressing initiative and vitality. Other representatives proposed that the government is a positive factor in social development and should fully play its role in intervening in the economy and society, strengthening government functions. Especially for third-world countries with relatively backward economies and cultures, scarce resources, underdeveloped social organizations, and intensified conflicts of interest due to social changes, it is necessary to strengthen government functions and fully play the role of government policy guidance and macro-control, thereby effectively intervening in and guiding the entire modernization process. Of course, this strengthening mainly involves strengthening the government's macro-control functions and the government's comprehensive management functions over all aspects of society, which is not contradictory to the process of decentralization and enhancing the vitality of enterprises and grassroots levels, but is a two-way, complementary process.

4. **The Relationship Between Central and Local Governments**: The relationship between central and local governments is a common concern in the administrative management of various countries. Representatives from various countries introduced their handling principles and practices. Representatives generally believed that handling the relationship between central and local governments and maintaining a balance between the two is a very complex matter, involving the political, legal, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds of various countries, making it difficult to find a universally applicable model. Many representatives pointed out that decentralization is a very complex matter. Practice has proven that there should be clear guiding principles and specific contents in the matter of decentralization. It should be clear which powers the central government should retain, which powers are shared between the central and local governments, and which are exclusively held. Without clear principles and specific guidelines, decentralization will fail. Many representatives believed that decentralization must be guaranteed by comprehensive measures. To prevent the already decentralized powers from being taken back, economic, legal, and administrative means should be used to consolidate the results of decentralization. Some representatives believed that developing countries, in order to ensure the coordinated development of the entire country and concentrate efforts to promote the modernization process of the entire country, must strengthen central macro-control. Representatives from various countries introduced some practices, including strengthening the legal system, clarifying management authority and punishing overreaching behaviors through legislation; controlling local government members; and controlling through financial allocation plans. The central government's income accounts for a large part of the total income in most countries, and the central government can control the development of local economies through construction projects.

    改革政府管理职能　提高效率改善服务
    ——政府行政管理改革国际研讨会综述
    文吉　维伟
    由国家机构编制委员会和国家人事部共同举办的“政府行政管理改革国际研讨会”，于今年10月中旬在北京召开。来自14个国家和国际组织的高级官员、专家、学者以及我国有关部委、部分省市、部分高等院校和科研单位的代表参加了会议。
    这次会议围绕着政府行政管理改革这个主题，初步介绍了各国行政管理改革的作法和经验，探讨了行政管理改革的发展趋势、目标和内容、政府职能、决策科学化、中央与地方的关系等，并对我国行政管理改革提出了建议。
    一、行政管理改革的模式和方法问题。代表们认为，随着国家管理任务的变化，世界各国无论是发展中国家还是发达国家，都面临着改革政府管理这一挑战性任务。有的代表归纳出三种趋势，一是强调权力下放，强调中央政府与地方政府建立健康的平衡，二是强调控制公共行政开支的规模，强调审计工作；三是研究改进行政服务工作的质量和优化运行程序。代表们认为，不同的历史背景和经济、政治、文化条件决定了不同国家必须寻求适合自己的管理模式，没有统一的模式。与其建立一种普遍适用的模式，不如考虑各国的具体情况，选择不同的模式。
    二、行政管理改革的目标和内容问题。关于行政管理改革的目标有不同的表述。一部分代表认为，政府行政管理的目标是追求行政效率和效益。另一些代表提出改革的目标主要是更好地为公共服务，改善公共行政机构与服务对象的关系。这是90年代国际公共行政领域的主要潮流。
    关于改革的内容，有的代表认为，所谓行政体制，是指行政权力结构及其运转方式。政府行政管理体制改革的主要内容有五方面：（1）政府职能总体配置与行政组织结构的合理化；（2）行政决策的科学化；（3）行政执行以及信息反馈系统的完善化，完善政府各部门的行政首长负责制和健全政府内部指挥渠道；（4）政府工作人员的素质及人员结构；（5）规范行政行为，完善行政运行机制。有的代表则提出，行政管理体制改革包括三方面：（1）机构的改革，包括精简机构减少人员；
  （2）体制的改革，包括运行程序、计划执行方式的改革等；（3）人力资源的发展。还有的代表认为，行政管理体制改革包括两部分，一部分是结构的变化，如职权、精简机构和人员、完善行政程序等，另一部分是政府工作人员行为的变化，如培训人员，奖励制度，政府工作人员的责任心和独立工作能力，等等。
    三、政府的作用问题。代表们普遍认为，随着经济的发展和技术革命的推进，政府的作用在不断变化。但对变化的趋势有不同认识。有些代表认为，政府应该尽量避免对经济和社会的干预，政府职能应趋于弱化；政府应当下放权力，发挥社会组织的作用，不要压抑积极性和活力。另一些代表提出：政府是社会发展的一种积极因素，应充分发挥政府对经济和社会的干预作用，强化政府职能。尤其是对第三世界国家经济文化的相对落后，各类资源相对短缺，社会组织发育不完善，社会变革导致各方面利益冲突加剧，要求强化政府职能，充分发挥政府政策导向、宏观调控的作用，从而对整个现代化进程进行有效的干预和引导。当然，这种强化主要是加强政府宏观调控职能，加强政府对全社会各个方面的综合管理职能，这与权力下放，增强企业和基层的活力的过程并不矛盾，而是一种双向的、相辅相成的过程。
    四、关于中央与地方的关系问题。中央政府与地方政府的关系是各国行政管理中共同关心的问题。与会的各国代表介绍了各自的处理原则和作法。代表们普遍认为，处理中央政府与地方政府的关系、保持两者之间的平衡是一件十分复杂的事情，涉及到各国的政治、法律、民族、文化背景，难以找到一种普遍适用的模式。不少代表指出，权力下放是一件十分复杂的事情。实践证明，在权力下放问题上应有明确的指导原则和具体内容。应当明确哪些权力是中央政府应当保留的，哪些权力是中央与地方政府共享的，哪些是独享的，没有明确的原则和具体的指导，权力下放就会失败。许多代表认为，权力下放必须有综合措施加以保障。为了避免已经下放的权力又收回来，要采取经济的、法律的、行政的手段来巩固权力下放的成果。一些代表认为，发展中国家为了保证整个国家的协调发展，集中力量推进整个国家现代化进程，必须加强中央宏观调控。各国代表介绍了一些作法，一是加强法制，通过立法明确各自的管理权限和制裁越权行为；二是对地方政府成员的控制；三是通过财政拨款计划进行控制。大多数国家的中央政府收入占总收入的大部分，中央政府可以通过建设项目来调控地方经济的发展。
