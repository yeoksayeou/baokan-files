The Arab League Council held a special meeting to discuss the current state of the Middle East peace process and called for support for the uprising in the occupied territories.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, November 29th, at the request of the State of Palestine, the special meeting of the Arab League Council opened here tonight to discuss the recent developments in the Middle East peace process.

The meeting was chaired by Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat attended the meeting.

Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi delivered the opening speech. Klibi said that although Arab countries have encountered some difficulties due to Israel's intransigence, they must remember that the various resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict unanimously adopted by them have sparked a powerful movement in the international community to support the Arab and Palestinian cause and implement international legal standards. Arab countries must take their unified stance as the basis for their actions to alert international public opinion to Israel's plots to suppress the Palestinian uprising and attempt to perpetuate its rule over the occupied territories.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, November 30th, the Arab League Council issued a news release today.

The news release said that the special meeting, based on the resolutions of previous Arab summit conferences on the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict, discussed the following main objectives for the current stage: Israel must withdraw from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967, starting with Jerusalem; restore the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to return to their homes, self-determination, and the establishment of an independent state; mobilize all Arab forces to achieve a comprehensive strategic balance to counter Israel's aggression plans and safeguard Arab rights. The news release called for mobilizing all forces to better support the Palestinian people's uprising and protect them from Israeli aggression.

    阿盟理事会举行特别会议
    讨论中东和平进程现状  呼吁支持被占领土起义
    据新华社突尼斯11月29日电　应巴勒斯坦国的请求，阿拉伯联盟理事会特别会议今晚在这里开幕，讨论中东和平进程的最近发展情况。
    会议由阿曼苏丹卡布斯·本·赛义德主持。巴勒斯坦国总统阿法拉特出席了会议。
    阿盟秘书长卡利比致开幕词。卡利比说，尽管阿拉伯国家由于以色列的不妥协而遇到了一些困难，但是它们必须牢记，它们一致通过的关于阿以冲突的各项决议已在国际上激起了一个强大的支持阿拉伯和巴勒斯坦事业、实施国际法准则的运动。阿拉伯国家必须把自己的一致立场作为自己行动的基础，以便使国际舆论警惕以色列策划的消灭巴勒斯坦起义和企图长期统治被占领土的阴谋。
    据新华社突尼斯11月30日电　阿拉伯联盟理事会今天发表一项新闻公报。
    公报说，特别会议根据历次阿拉伯首脑会议关于巴勒斯坦问题和阿以冲突的决议，讨论了目前阶段的下列主要目标：以色列必须撤出1967年以来占领的所有巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯领土，首先是耶路撒冷；恢复巴勒斯坦人民不可剥夺的权利，其中包括返回家园、自决和建立独立国家的权利；动员阿拉伯各方面的力量来实现全面的战略平衡，以对付以色列的侵略计划和维护阿拉伯的权利。公报呼吁，动员各种力量更好地支持巴勒斯坦人民的起义和保护他们免遭以色列的侵害。
