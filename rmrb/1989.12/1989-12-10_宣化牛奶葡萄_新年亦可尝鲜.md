	Fresh Milk Grapes from Xuanhua Available for the New Year

	BEIJING (People's Daily) — Milk grapes from Xuanhua, which were previously only available fresh during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, can now also be enjoyed during the New Year. This is the result of research on storage and preservation technology for milk grapes, conducted by the Food Science Department of Beijing Agricultural University in collaboration with the Xuanhua Grape Research Institute. The results of this research were approved on November 29.

	Xuanhua milk grapes have a long history of cultivation and are renowned both domestically and internationally for their large clusters, large grains, crisp flesh, and delicate skin. Through experiments exploring the storage conditions, methods, and preservatives for Xuanhua milk grapes, the grapes stored in cold storage remain with green stems, plump fruits, vibrant colors, and normal flavors even after 70 days. The rate of good-quality grapes reaches over 90%.
