The leaders of the Central Military Commission entered the meeting hall, happily shaking hands and greeting everyone, and taking group photos with the attendees of the three military conferences.

The Military Political Work Conference, which began on December 11th, is guided by the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the 13th Central Committee and the Enlarged Meeting of the Military Commission. It focuses on studying and discussing how to further strengthen and improve political work in the new situation, ensuring the Party's absolute leadership over the military, and ensuring that the military remains politically qualified. At the beginning of the conference, Yang Baibing explained the draft document "Several Issues on Strengthening and Improving Military Political Work in the New Situation" submitted for discussion.

It is understood that the Military Political Work Conference, which focuses on high-level leadership organs of the entire military's political work leadership cadres, is the first time to specially study the issue of how to do military political work in the new situation. This conference has been in preparation for a long time. At the beginning of last year, Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun proposed that attention should be paid to studying how to do ideological and political work in the new situation of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy. All military units have conducted extensive research and achieved many results. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the military has also summarized new experiences. This conference aims to concentrate and elevate the research results and practical experiences of the military in strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation of reform and opening up, forming a guiding document that is highly targeted and can solve problems for the entire military.

Also present at the meeting were members of the Central Military Commission, Hong Xuezhi, Qin Jiwei, Chi Haotian, Zhao Nanqi, and others. (Photo attached)

    新华社北京12月14日电  （记者刘回年、罗玉文）江泽民、杨尚昆、刘华清、杨白冰等中央军委领导同志今天下午在人民大会堂亲切会见了出席全军政治工作会议的同志。同时被会见的还有出席全军后勤工作会议和空军党委全会的同志。
    中央军委领导同志来到会见厅，高兴地和大家握手、致意，并分别和出席军队三个会议的同志合影留念。
    12月11日开始举行的全军政治工作会议，以党的十三届四中全会、五中全会和军委扩大会议精神为指导，集中研究和讨论在新的形势下如何进一步加强和改进政治工作，保证党对军队的绝对领导，保证军队在政治上永远合格的问题。会议开始时，杨白冰就提交会议讨论的《关于新形势下加强和改进军队政治工作的若干问题》作了说明。
    据悉，全军政治工作会议集中全军高级领导机关的政治工作领导干部，专门研究如何做好新形势下的军队政治工作问题，多年来还是第一次。这次会议酝酿已久，准备充分。去年初，军委副主席杨尚昆就提出，要重视研究改革开放、发展社会主义商品经济新形势下思想政治工作怎么做的问题。全军各部队普遍开展研究并取得了不少成果。平息北京反革命暴乱后，军队又总结了新的经验。这次会议就是要把近年来部队在改革开放新形势下加强和改进思想政治工作方面的研究成果与实践经验加以集中和提高，形成一个对全军针对性比较强、能够解决问题的指导性文件。
    参加今天会见的还有中央军委委员洪学智、秦基伟、迟浩田、赵南起等。（附图片）
