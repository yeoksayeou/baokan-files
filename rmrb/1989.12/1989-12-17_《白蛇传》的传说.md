The legend of "The White Snake" can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty, in a book titled "Boya Zhi" written by Zheng Changzu. In the second year of the Yuanhe era, a man named Li Huan from Longxi encountered a beautiful woman in white clothing who was exceptionally charming. Later, when he visited her, he saw an old woman with green eyes standing in the courtyard, whom he was told was the woman's aunt. Subsequently, people noticed that Li had an unusual foul odor and gradually fell ill. When he returned to the woman's former residence to investigate, he found an empty garden with only a locust tree and a giant snake on it, with nothing else. Although this story differs greatly from the later "The White Snake," the "beautiful woman in white" and the "old woman with green eyes," as well as the "giant white snake," are quite similar to Bai Niangzi and Xiao Qing. The storytelling and folk plays that were popular during the Southern Song Dynasty were based on this story. By the Ming Dynasty, the performer Mo Langzi adapted it into "Leifeng Guai Ji," portraying Bai Niangzi in a more lovable way. Later, Feng Menglong edited "Bai Niangzi Yongzhen Leifeng Ta," which completed the prototype of today's "The White Snake." During the early Qing Dynasty, Huang Sheng adapted it into a dramatic script titled "Leifeng Ta."

    《白蛇传》的传说
    《白蛇传》故事的影子，可以追溯到唐代郑还古所撰《博异志》。元和二年，陇西人李璜，途中见白衣之姝，绰约有绝代之色。后造访，见青眼老女郎立于庭，谓白衣之姨也。之后，人们发觉李身有腥臊气异常，渐罗沉疴。再至白姝旧宅寻觅则乃空园，只见一皂荚树，上有巨蛇，便无别物。这个故事虽与后来《白蛇传》大异其趣，然“白衣之姝”与“青眼老女郎”及“巨白蛇”却与白娘娘与小青很相似。盛行于南宋的说书和评话剧底本，即据于此。这个故事传到明代，艺人墨浪子编《雷峰怪迹》把白娘娘写得可爱多了。续后，冯梦龙编《白娘子永镇雷峰塔》则已完成现今《白蛇传》的原型。到清乾隆初年黄图再改编为传奇本《雷峰塔》。
