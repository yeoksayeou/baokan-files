The comrades at Xiao Dong Station say, "Switching tracks must be 'not one bit off,' and other railway equipment and tasks related to train operations must also be 'not one bit off.'" By adhering to this principle, they have created the miracle of 41 consecutive years without accidents.

Switching tracks is a matter of life and death, so it must be "not one bit off." This is easy to understand. But what about other tasks and other regulations? Can they be a bit sloppy or off by a bit? Perhaps some people think so. However, many major accidents are often caused by being careless about seemingly minor issues. Such tragedies and lessons are indeed not uncommon in real life. The regulations in various tasks are summaries of practical experience, reflecting people's understanding of objective laws. When executing them, they must also be "not one bit off." If not, thinking that it's not a big deal, being off by a bit today and a bit more tomorrow, even the most important and perfect regulations will gradually become meaningless. One day, it will be "off by a little, wrong by a mile," and the "careless ones" will ruin big things.

Therefore, it can be said that "not one bit off, not one bit off is acceptable" is indeed an important principle in work. This is because it contains a very precious sense of responsibility, a spirit that is indispensable for the Four Modernizations.

    赞“一点不差”精神
    若谷
    “扳道岔要‘一点不差’，对其他行车设备以及与行车有关的工作‘差一点也不行’”，小东车站的同志这样说，这样做，终于创造了连续41年无事故的奇迹。
    “扳道岔”性命交关，要求“一点不差”，好理解。其它方面的工作、其他方面的规章制度，是否就可以马虎一点、差它几分呢？也许有人会这样想。殊不知，多少重大事故往往就是因为在看来是细小的问题上马马虎虎酿成的。这样的悲剧、这样的教训，实际生活中实在是不少了。各项工作中的规章制度，是实践经验的总结，反映了人们对客观规律的认识，执行起来应当“差一点也不行”才是，如果不是这样，自以为关系不大，今天差一分，明天偏五厘，再重要、再完善的规章制度也会渐渐形同虚设，终有一天会“差之毫厘，谬以千里”，让“马大哈”们坏了大事的。
    因此可以说，工作中“一点不差，差一点也不行”实在是一条重要的原则，因为这其中蕴含了一种十分可贵的负责精神，一种四化建设须臾不可少的精神。
