    Spirit Shines in the Ordinary

    In recent years, a trend of comparison has emerged among some leading cadres: homes must have air conditioning, offices must be comfortable, and cars must be high-end. However, the leaders of the Hengyang Municipal Personnel Bureau still use a Beijing Jeep that was issued by higher authorities four years ago.

    Currently, several leaders of the Municipal Personnel Bureau do not meet the housing standards for bureau-level cadres. Deputy Director He Ying currently lives in a 20-square-meter, one-bedroom, one-living-room apartment. His son, who is in junior high school, shares the space with the adults. Deputy Director He Jiqi, who has been in the position since 1982, still lives in an 8-year-old, 30-plus-square-meter "edge room."

    The leaders of the Municipal Personnel Bureau hold the power over the recruitment, hiring, and placement of cadres, as well as the resettlement of military personnel and the general allocation of cadres throughout the city. They insist on handling all matters that comply with policies without fail, but they refuse to accept any gifts. Once, a person came to the home of the Municipal Personnel Bureau leader in charge of recruitment, hoping to have his son recruited as a cadre. Before leaving, he left a red envelope containing 200 yuan. The leader immediately returned the envelope. A demobilized soldier, who worked in vehicle management in the military, was assigned to the transportation department after demobilization. To express his gratitude, he brought several large grass carp to the Municipal Personnel Bureau leader, but it was still refused.

    The bureau leaders often personally sweep the floors and clear the drains with shovels. The deputy director in charge of finances carefully calculates every expense, from purchasing office supplies to various expenditures. Each department holds two to three business meetings per year, and the meeting expenses are always meticulously calculated. Over the years, they have saved thousands of yuan in meeting reception fees each year.

    平凡之处显精神
    近年来，一些领导干部中间刮起了一股攀比风：住房讲空调，办公讲舒畅，坐车讲高档。然而，衡阳市人事局领导同志坐车，还是4年前上级配发的那台北京吉普。
    目前市人事局的几位领导人都没有达到局级干部的住房标准。副局长贺嵘如今还是住着一室一厅20平方米挂零的住房。读初中的儿子和大人们一起凑合住着。1982年就当副局长的何际芝至今还住在8年前分下的30多平方米的“边脚房”里。
    市人事局的领导同志掌握着全市招干、聘干、录干、军转干部安置、一般干部调配的权力。他们坚持符合政策该办的事责无旁贷，但拒收任何礼物。一次，有位同志为了使儿子能招为干部便来到分管招干的市人事局领导人家里，临走时留下一个红包，里面有200元人民币。这位领导同志当场把红包退还。有位转业军人，在部队从事汽车管理工作，转业后分到交通部门。为了表示谢意，他特地拿着几条大草鱼，送给市人事局领导人，但仍被拒绝了。
    局领导同志经常手持扫把清扫地面，拿起铁锹清理水沟。从购办公用品到各项开支，负责管财务的副局长掰着指头算细帐。各科室每年要开两三次业务会议，会议开支总是精打细算。几年来，他们每年节约会议招待费几千元。　　　　　　　湖南衡阳市　曹德
