    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States recently released a report indicating that the ozone hole over the Antarctic this year has expanded northward by 480 kilometers, approaching the southern tip of the inhabited South American continent.

    According to the British journal *Nature*, the ozone hole over the Antarctic this year appeared in mid-August, one month earlier than last year.

    The report states that in the newly expanded "halo" of the ozone hole over the Antarctic, the ozone depletion rate is between 15% and 25%.
