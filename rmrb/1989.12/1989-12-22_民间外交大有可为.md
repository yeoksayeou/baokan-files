The extensive development of people's diplomacy is a major feature of New China's diplomacy, an important component of Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic thought, and a unique creation of New China in international relations. In today's historical new period of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, people's diplomacy has great potential, and Premier Zhou's thought on people's diplomacy will forever shine brightly.

As early as the 1940s, Premier Zhou made significant contributions to opening up friendly exchanges between the people of the liberated areas of China and the people of various countries. Soon after the founding of New China, in response to the development of domestic and international situations, Premier Zhou actively advocated for the extensive development of people's diplomacy to meet the needs of the Chinese people and the people of the world to enhance mutual understanding and establish and develop friendly cooperative relations with various countries. On December 15, 1949, Premier Zhou initiated the establishment of the first organization in New China dedicated to people's diplomacy—the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries—and served as the honorary president of the association until his death. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi also served as honorary president. Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other leaders of the Party and the state also attached great importance to foreign people-to-people exchanges. They provided many valuable instructions for the work of the association and often personally received important foreign guests of the association despite their busy schedules.

The association is the same age as New China and, as one of the main channels for implementing Premier Zhou's thought on people's diplomacy, has gone through a glorious 40-year journey. Over the years, it has engaged in activities such as receiving and visiting, participating in and organizing bilateral and multilateral conferences to study international issues, editing and publishing diplomatic policy documents and publications, and conducting academic exchanges. It has established extensive contacts and exchanges with politicians, diplomats, international affairs experts, scholars, and social figures from almost all countries and international organizations in the world. It has played an important role in promoting the establishment and development of state relations, making official diplomacy have a solid mass base.

As an important organization for carrying out people's diplomacy activities, the association often expresses the will of the Chinese people on major international issues, organizes meetings and issues statements in support of the government's diplomacy, and supports and champions the just struggles of the peoples of various countries to achieve national independence and defend state sovereignty, fight against imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism, and defend world peace.

Over the past 40 years, the association has received more than 10,000 foreign guests from more than 120 countries and regions in five continents. Among them, more than 80% are upper-level figures from the political and economic circles, including nearly 100 former presidents and prime ministers.

Before the establishment of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the association, in response to the urgent demand of the peoples of various countries to learn about the revolutionary achievements and construction successes of New China and to engage in friendly exchanges with it, assisted people's organizations in nine Western European countries in establishing pro-China friendship associations with a focus on cultural exchanges. This undoubtedly benefited the mutual understanding between the peoples of China and these countries and the subsequent establishment of diplomatic relations.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of foreign guests received by the association came from 65 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with a significant proportion being leaders of parties or countries engaged in the struggle for national independence. After these Third World countries gained independence, they formed a wave of establishing diplomatic relations with China one after another. During this period, China did not have official diplomatic relations with many Western countries, but many famous political activists came to China as guests of the association. Notable among them were former French Prime Ministers Edgar Faure and Pierre Mendès-France, former Italian Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, former British Prime Ministers Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson, whose visits played an important role in promoting the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France and the development of relations with Britain and other Western countries.

During this period, the association maintained close contacts with people from various circles in Japan. Since receiving the first batch of Japanese guests in 1954, the association has received many Japanese friends and issued a famous joint statement with the Japanese delegation to China, opposing the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and demanding the normalization of diplomatic relations. These efforts played a special role in closely coordinating official diplomacy and promoting "people's diplomacy to facilitate official diplomacy."

With the opening of the door to Sino-American relations, the 1970s saw another wave of many countries establishing diplomatic relations with China. While official diplomacy made significant progress, the people's diplomacy work of the association also entered a new period of great development. Its outstanding feature was that politicians from Western countries, especially the United States, became the main objects of the association's reception. During this decade, more than 80% of the foreign guests received were from Western countries. Their visits promoted the establishment and comprehensive development of relations between China and these countries and organizations, creating an unprecedented situation of "official and civilian diplomacy working together" and "official diplomacy and people's diplomacy complementing each other."

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, with the deepening of reform and opening up and the adjustment of foreign policies, the work of the association has entered a new stage of development. Its scope of work has become even broader, its objects of contact even more extensive, its content of activities even richer, its methods even more diverse, and its achievements even more abundant.

Notably, the association continues to strengthen contacts with political figures from various countries, discussing major international issues and bilateral relations of common concern. At the same time, it has established extensive contacts with people from various industries such as business, finance, and academia in various countries, playing a role in bridging connections for relevant regions and departments in China to carry out economic and technological cooperation and cultural and educational exchanges with foreign countries.

In the past decade, the association has invited more than 100 academic delegations studying international issues and many scholars and experts to visit China or participate in various seminars. At the same time, it sends delegations every year to participate in bilateral and multilateral international issue conferences organized by such institutions and visits relevant institutions in dozens of countries across several continents. It continuously expands contacts with these organizations and often co-hosts various scales and forms of seminars and discussion meetings with visiting foreign guests and some famous research institutions.

The 40-year journey of the association is sufficient to prove that people's diplomacy has great potential. The current international situation is undergoing major changes, and the association will further play its due role in coordinating with official diplomacy, implementing China's independent and peaceful foreign policy, opposing hegemonism and power politics, maintaining world peace, and promoting mutual understanding and friendly cooperation among the peoples of various countries.

    民间外交大有可为
    韩念龙
    广泛开展民间外交是新中国外交的一大特征，是周恩来总理外交思想的一个重要组成部分，也是新中国在国际关系中的一个创造。在今天建设中国特色的社会主义的历史新时期，人民外交大有可为，周总理的人民外交思想将永放光芒。
    早在四十年代，周总理就为开辟中国解放区人民与各国人民友好交往，作出了巨大贡献。新中国诞生不久，根据国内外形势的发展，为了适应中国人民和世界人民增进相互了解，同各国建立并发展友好合作关系的需要，周总理又积极提倡广泛开展民间外交。一九四九年十二月十五日，周总理倡导成立了新中国第一个专门从事人民外交的机构——中国人民外交学会，并于生前一直担任外交学会的名誉会长。陈毅副总理兼外长也曾出任名誉会长。邓小平同志和党和国家的其他领导人也都十分重视对外民间交往，他们对外交学会的工作给予许多宝贵指示，并经常在百忙中亲自接见学会的重要外宾。
    外交学会与新中国同龄，作为贯彻周总理人民外交思想的主要渠道之一，迄今已走过了四十年的光辉历程。长期以来它通过接待、出访、参加和组织双边和多边会议研究国际问题、编辑出版外交政策文献和书刊，进行学术交流等活动，同世界上绝大多数国家和国际组织的政治家、外交家、国际问题专家、学者和社会名流等进行广泛联系和交往，为推动国家关系的建立和发展，发挥了与官方外交殊途同归的重要作用，使政府外交具有坚实的群众基础。
    作为开展人民外交活动的重要团体，外交学会经常就有关重大国际问题表达我国人民的意志，配合政府外交组织集会、发表声明，支持和声援世界各国人民争取民族独立和维护国家主权、反帝、反殖、反对霸权主义、保卫世界和平的正义斗争。
    四十年来，外交学会已接待来自世界五大洲一百二十多个国家、地区的外宾逾万人。其中百分之八十以上是政、经各界上层人士，其中前总统、前总理近百人。
    在我国对外文化协会成立之前，外交学会为适应各国人民渴望了解新中国革命胜利和建设成就以及同我进行友好交往的迫切要求，曾协助西欧九个国家的人民团体筹建了以文化交流为主的对华友好协会，这对促进我国与这些国家人民之间的相互了解，以及后来建立邦交，无疑是有益的。
    五十和六十年代，外交学会接待的绝大多数外宾来自亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的六十五个国家和地区，其中正在进行争取民族独立斗争的党派或国家的领导人占有相当的比重。这些第三世界国家赢得独立后，形成了相继同我国建交的高潮。在这一时期，我国同许多西方国家没有正式外交关系，但很多著名政治活动家曾作为外交学会的客人前来中国。这里值得一提的有，法国前总理埃加·富尔和孟戴斯—弗朗斯，意大利前总理范范尼，英国前首相艾德礼和威尔逊等，这些访问对推动中法建交和同英国等西方国家关系的发展具有重要意义。
    在此期间，外交学会同日本各界人士保持了密切的交往。从一九五四年接待第一批日本外宾以来，外交学会接待了许多日本朋友，曾和日本访华团发表了著名的联合声明，反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋，要求实现邦交正常化，这些都起到了紧密配合官方外交和“以民促官”的特殊作用。
    随着中美关系大门的打开，七十年代形成了许多国家纷纷与我国建交的又一高潮。在官方外交取得长足进展的同时，外交学会的人民外交工作也迎来了一个新的大发展时期。它的突出特点是，以政界人士为主的西方国家，特别是美国外宾成了外交学会接待的主要对象。这十年间接待西方国家的外宾，占同期接待外宾总数的百分之八十以上。他们的访问促进了我国与这些国家和有关组织关系的建立和全面发展，开创了前所未有的“官民并举”、官方外交和人民外交“相辅相成”的新局面。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，随着改革开放的逐步深入和对外政策的调整，外交学会的工作又跨入了一个新的发展阶段，工作范围更加扩大，交往对象更加广泛，活动内容更加丰富，方式更加多样，成果更加丰硕。
    比较突出的是，我会继续大力加强同各国政界要人的接触。就共同关心的重大国际问题和双边关系问题进行了探讨，同时，它也同各国企业界、金融界、学术界等不同行业的人士建立了广泛的联系，为我国有关地区和部门开展对外经济技术合作和文化教育交流起了些牵线搭桥的作用。
    近十年来，我会还邀请了一百多个研究国际问题的学术性代表团及许多学者、专家来华访问或参加各种研讨会。同时，每年派出代表团参加这类机构主办的双边和多边国际问题的会议；访问了各大洲几十个国家的许多有关机构。不断扩大同这些组织的联系。并经常同来访外宾和一些著名的研究机构共同举行各种规模、各种形式的座谈会和讨论会。
    外交学会四十年来的历程足以表明民间外交大有可为。当前国际形势正在发生重大的变化，外交学会在配合政府外交，贯彻我国独立自主的和平外交政策，反对霸权主义、强权政治，维护世界和平，增进各国人民的相互了解和友好合作等方面，将进一步发挥应有的作用。
