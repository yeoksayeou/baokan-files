The fourth plenary session of the seventh central committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) concluded today. The session passed a resolution stating that the RCCK will inherit and carry forward the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's patriotism, revolution, and continuous progress. The RCCK firmly opposes any actions aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and any attempts to plot "Taiwan independence." The RCCK will continue to work tirelessly with patriotic individuals from all sectors in Taiwan to achieve the great cause of national reunification.

The resolution also states that strengthening economic and cultural exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan, and promoting peaceful national reunification, has become an irresistible historical trend. This reflects the fundamental interests and common aspirations of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. However, recently, the Taiwan authorities have been promoting a so-called "flexible diplomacy," attempting to create "two Chinas." At the same time, the "Taiwan independence" forces have been increasingly active, openly advocating for "Taiwan independence" and plotting to split the country. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people, including those in Taiwan.

The resolution further calls on all levels of RCCK organizations and all party members to align their thinking with the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They should uphold the glorious tradition of the RCCK and the Communist Party of China working together through thick and thin, and adhere to the idea that stability is paramount. They should prepare for several years of hardship, stay spirited, do practical work, and contribute their efforts to overcoming difficulties and promoting the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

Vice Chairpersons of the RCCK Central Committee, Zheng Dongguo, Jia Yibin, Peng Qingyuan, Li Ganliu, He Luli, and Li Peiyao, as well as Chairman of the RCCK Central Committee Disciplinary Committee Sun Yueqi, and Vice Chairpersons Tan Tewu and Liao Yunzhou, attended the meeting.

    民革中央七届四次常委会结束
    据新华社北京12月20日电（记者张严平）今天结束的民革中央七届常委会第四次会议通过决议表示：民革继承和发扬孙中山先生爱国、革命和不断进步的精神，坚决反对任何制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”和策划“台湾独立”的言行，并将一如既往，愿与台湾各界爱国人士携起手来，共同为完成祖国统一大业进行不懈的努力。
    会议通过决议说，加强大陆和台湾的经济文化交流，促进祖国和平统一，已经成为不可遏制的历史潮流，反映了两岸人民的根本利益和共同愿望。但是，最近以来，台湾当局推行所谓“弹性外交”，企图制造“两个中国”。同时，“台独”势力的活动日益猖獗，公然鼓吹“台湾独立”，阴谋分裂祖国。这是包括台湾人民在内的中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    决议还要求民革各级组织和全体党员，把认识统一到中共十三届五中全会的精神上来，发扬民革与中国共产党风雨同舟、患难与共的光荣传统，坚持稳定高于一切的思想，做好过几年紧日子的准备，振奋精神，多做实事，为克服困难，促进国民经济持续、稳定、协调地发展贡献自己的力量。
    民革中央副主席郑洞国、贾亦斌、彭清源、李赣骝、何鲁丽、李沛瑶，民革中央监察委员会主席孙越崎、副主席谭惕吾、廖运周参加了会议。
