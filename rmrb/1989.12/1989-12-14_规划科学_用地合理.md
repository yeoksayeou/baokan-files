	Scientific Planning and Rational Land Use
	Zheng Kunsheng, Ministry of Construction, Rural Construction Bureau

	The role of China's village and town planning and design in saving arable land is beginning to emerge. After 1979, rural reforms achieved remarkable results, and farmers, who were gradually becoming prosperous, urgently needed to improve their living conditions. To effectively stop the phenomenon of arbitrarily occupying arable land, in April 1981, the State Council issued the "Urgent Notice on Stopping the Occupation of Arable Land by Rural Housing Construction," clearly stating that rural housing construction must be unified in planning, rationally laid out, and economize on land use. By the end of 1986, 90% of towns and 70% of villages had initial plans, ending the era of spontaneous and blind construction in rural areas.

	However, the role of village and town planning and design has not yet been fully realized. There are many reasons for this: First, village and town planning and design must establish a set of scientific and feasible quota indicators to comprehensively coordinate and arrange various construction projects to achieve the effect of saving land. After Linli County in Hunan Province formulated the city plan, it adjusted the land use of 17 towns according to the quota indicators, reducing the per capita land use by 51 square meters. After implementation, it can save more than 9,300 acres of land. According to statistics, there are 190 million rural households nationwide, occupying 180 million acres of land. If all villages can be planned and implemented according to the quota indicators, it is very possible to save 20 million acres of land by the year 2000. Second, village and town planning and design are different from "tailoring cloth." Its implementation is a process that progresses gradually with the economy. Generally, the planning period is set for more than 10 years, and its land-saving effect cannot be fully realized in one or two years. In the process of implementing the plan, some households have relatively large existing plots, which are not enough to be divided into two, and can only be gradually vacated. If we insist on original site demolition and reconstruction, not only will it affect the implementation of the plan and fail to achieve the land-saving effect, but it will also lead to forced large-scale demolition and reconstruction, damaging economic momentum and causing public dissatisfaction. Third, the formulation and implementation of village and town planning and design not only rely on a professional technical team and management team with good quality, but also need to strengthen legal education for the vast number of farmers, and obtain the support and respect of leaders and relevant departments at all levels. Once the plan is formed, land must be strictly approved according to the plan for construction.

### 规划科学  用地合理

    规划科学  用地合理
    建设部村镇建设司  郑坤生
    我国村镇规划设计在节约耕地中所起的作用已经开始显示出来。1979年以后，农村改革取得了显著成效，逐步富裕起来的农民迫切要求改善居住条件。为了有力地制止滥占耕地的现象，1981年4月，国务院颁发了《关于制止农村建房侵占耕地的紧急通知》，明确农村建房必须统一规划、合理布局、节约用地。至1986年底，90％的集镇和70％的村庄有了初步规划，结束了乡村建房自发自流、盲目建设的局面。
    然而，村镇规划设计的作用还远远没有充分发挥出来。原因是多方面的：第一，村镇规划设计必须制订一套科学的切实可行的定额指标，对各项建设进行综合协调安排，达到节用土地的效果。湖南省临澧县编制县城规划后，按定额指标对17个集镇的用地进行了调整，人均用地减少51平方米，实施完成后可节地9300余亩。据统计，全国现有农户1.9亿户，村庄占地1.8亿亩，若能全部按定额指标要求编制并实施规划，到2000年村庄占地省出2000万亩是很有可能的。第二，村镇规划设计不同于
  “裁衣料”，它的实施是一个与经济同步渐进的过程。一般规划的期限都定为10年以上，其节地效果就不可能在一二年内全部体现。在执行规划过程中，有些农户现有宅基较大，又不足以一分为二，只能逐步腾挪。假使一味强调原址拆建，不但影响规划实施，达不到节地效果，而且会导致强行的大拆大建，伤了经济后劲，引起群众不满。第三，村镇规划设计的编制和执行不仅需要依靠具有良好素质的专业技术队伍和管理队伍，还需要对广大农民加强法制教育，同时要得到各级领导和有关部门的支持与尊重。规划一旦形成，就要严格按规划审批土地，进行建设。
