At the Dalian Shipyard, which has over 15,000 employees, there are no managers who do not participate in production labor. Since 1986, the managers of this shipyard have insisted on participating in production labor, and this has gradually become a voluntary action. Statistics show that each year, managers at the factory level work more than 20 days, office managers work more than 15 days, and workshop managers work more than 100 days. Now, the factory's ideological and political work is lively, the Party's prestige has been enhanced, the workers are spirited, and the production situation is excellent.

The Party and government leaders of the Dalian Shipyard believe that managers participating in production labor is a fine tradition and style that our Party has always advocated. Although the managers of socialist enterprises are in leadership positions, the nature of the working class cannot change; although the enterprise has implemented a contract management system, the position of the working class as the master of the enterprise cannot change. Only by constantly appearing as ordinary laborers can managers enhance their sense of respect for workers and work together to run the enterprise well. Based on this understanding, they regard managers participating in labor as a fundamental measure for building the cadre team.

When organizing managers to participate in labor, this factory pays great attention to institutional construction and does not go through the motions but focuses on effectiveness. First, a necessary organizational leadership system is established. The Party Committee unifies the planning and proposes requirements, deploys once a year, and the Trade Union, in conjunction with the Organization Department, Personnel Department, and various workshops and departments, specifically arranges and compiles. Specific plans are issued by the factory for implementation. Second, an assessment system is established. In the "Double Hundred" civilized competition regulations implemented throughout the factory, specific indicators for managers participating in production labor are listed, with monthly evaluations and annual summaries; when the factory encounters urgent tasks, a production supervision group is established to supervise the situation of leaders from the factory director down to management personnel serving and participating in labor on the front line and to promptly report to the entire factory; in the annual democratic appraisal of cadres, each cadre must summarize and report on their participation in production labor. Third, the performance of cadres participating in labor is used as an important condition for promotion and use. In the past three years, the factory has dismissed 12 cadres, most of whom did not go to the front line, had poor labor performance, and had many complaints from the masses; while the 20 cadres who were promoted all met the "four modernizations" standards, had hard labor, and were loved by the masses. Fourth, new cadres entering the factory must undergo labor training. College graduates entering the factory first participate in a one-year production internship, then go to business-matched workshops to work as workers for about three years, and then are allocated to positions based on their abilities. Workshop cadres are mainly selected from middle-aged workers with more than 10 years of production experience, while factory business department cadres are mainly selected from technical and business backbones on the production line. Now, most of the factory-level and middle-level cadres in the entire factory are selected from the production front line.

The leadership team of the "Big Ship" believes that managers participating in production labor is a good way to cultivate and train cadres. They require factory-level and middle-level cadres to take the lead in implementing the system of participating in production labor; the dirtier and more labor-intensive positions should have more leaders appearing; when encountering urgent tasks, leaders should take the lead.

Once, a 69,000-ton oil tanker's compartment needed special treatment, with very strict requirements and difficult working conditions. At that time, the project was already delayed, and if it was delayed for another two months, the foreign shipowner would abandon the ship. The factory leadership organized a cadre brigade to work hard for 20 days, successfully completing the first oil tank grinding task. Then, they organized more than 400 cadres to participate in grinding, working continuously to ensure the oil tanker was delivered on time. Foreign businessmen expressed admiration and praise.

The Dalian Shipyard emphasizes that managers participating in production labor should be combined with their respective work. Factory-level leaders generally participate in labor at important positions that affect the overall situation, and directly contact with grassroots cadres and workers, listen to their opinions, and understand the workers' emotions and production progress. Workshop-level leaders, in addition to topping up labor during heavy production tasks, usually combine labor with on-site dispatching and production organization work. The labor of office department cadres is as much as possible connected with their respective work. Various engineering and technical cadres are more organized to participate in the "three-in-one" attack and small groups, working with workshop workers and cadres to solve technical problems. Cadres at all levels and of all types feel that they have more time to contact the masses and can better play their intelligence and increase their abilities. Participating in production labor has become a common practice.

    优良传统作风不能丢　工人阶级本色不能变
    大连造船厂干部劳动形成制度
    干部的劳动表现是提拔使用的重要依据
    本报讯　在有15000余职工的大连造船厂，没有不参加生产劳动的干部。从1986年起，这个船厂的干部就坚持参加生产劳动，并逐渐成为自觉行动。据统计，每年厂级干部劳动20天以上，机关干部15天以上，车间干部100天以上。现在，全厂思想政治工作活跃，党的威信提高，职工精神振奋，生产形势喜人。
    大连造船厂党政领导认为，干部参加生产劳动，是我们党一贯倡导的优良传统和作风。社会主义企业的干部虽然身居领导岗位，但工人阶级的本色不能变；企业虽然实行了承包经营，但工人阶级在企业中的主人翁地位不能变。干部只有时刻以普通劳动者的身份出现，增强劳动人民的感情，才能有尊重工人的意识，共同把企业办好。基于这样的认识，他们把干部参加劳动作为干部队伍建设的一项根本性措施。
    这个厂在组织干部参加劳动时，十分重视制度建设，并且注意从企业特点出发，不走形式，注重实效。一是建立必要的组织领导系统。党委统一制订计划和提出要求，每年部署一次，由工会会同组织部、人事处和各车间、处室具体安排编制，具体计划由厂部下达执行。二是建立考核制度。在全厂开展的“双百分”文明竞赛条例中，专门列有干部参加生产劳动的具体指标，月评比，年总评；在全厂遇有突击性任务时，成立生产监察组，监察上自厂长下至管理人员深入一线服务和参加劳动的情况，并及时通报全厂；在每年一次的民主评议干部活动中，干部个人要总结和汇报参加生产劳动情况。三是把干部参加劳动的表现作为提拔、使用的一项重要条件。三年来，全厂撤换了12名干部，多数是不深入第一线、劳动表现不好、群众意见较大的；而提拔的20名干部，都是比较符合“四化”标准，劳动过得硬，受群众拥戴的。四是新入厂的干部必须经过劳动锻炼。大中专毕业生进厂后，先参加一年生产实习，再下到业务对口的车间当工人三年左右，然后量才分配上岗，车间干部主要从有10年以上生产实践经验的中年职工中选拔，厂业务处室干部则主要从生产一线中的技术、业务骨干中选拔。现在全厂的厂级和中层干部，绝大多数都是从生产第一线中选拔上来的。
    “大船”的领导班子认为，干部参加生产劳动，是培养锻炼干部的好形式。他们要求厂级和中层干部带头执行参加生产劳动的制度；越脏越累的岗位，越要有领导干部出现；遇到突击性任务时，领导干部要先上。
    有一次，一艘6.9万吨油轮的舱室需要特涂处理，要求十分严格，施工条件艰难。当时工程已经拖期，再耽误两个月国外船东即要弃船。厂领导组织干部突击队，苦干20天，出色地完成了第一个油舱打磨任务。接着，又组织400多名干部参加打磨，连续奋战，保证油轮按期交付。外商表示敬佩和称赞。
    大连造船厂强调干部参加生产劳动要同其所分管的工作结合起来。厂级领导干部一般多到对全局有影响的重要部位参加劳动，并与基层干部、职工直接接触，倾听他们的意见，掌握职工的情绪和生产进度。车间领导干部除生产任务重时适当顶岗劳动外，平时是同现场调度和生产组织工作结合在一起。机关处室干部的劳动，尽可能同他们分管的工作衔接。各类工程技术干部，较多的是组织他们到“三结合”攻关小组，同车间工人、干部一道动手解决技术难题。各级各类干部都感到既有较多时间接触群众，又能更好地发挥才智，增长才干，参加生产劳动蔚然成风。
