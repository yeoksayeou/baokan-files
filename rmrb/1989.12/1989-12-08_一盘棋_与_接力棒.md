In recent years, some regions have repeatedly complained about "losing money on grain production," while agriculture in Jiayu has steadily developed year after year. This is because they have established the concept of "one chessboard." When many places, in pursuit of immediate gains, have been unable to stop the indiscriminate felling of trees, the officials of Jiayu have been happy to engage in the business of planting trees for future generations to enjoy, because they have established the concept of the "relay baton."

The concepts of "one chessboard" and "relay baton" advocate considering the national big picture and the long-term interests of the people.

Establishing the concept of "one chessboard" means always remembering that one is a "piece" on the national "chessboard," and every move must consider the entire board. When necessary, one must be willing to pay a certain price and not act arbitrarily. One must absolutely not do anything that harms the overall situation.

Establishing the concept of the "relay baton" means playing a role in the development of a place's affairs during one's term in office, connecting the past with the future, and not neglecting the continuity of local work. One must not pursue short-term effects and seek immediate gains. The Communist Party's local officials are to struggle for the interests of the entire Party. Localism, separatism, utilitarianism, and the like are all unacceptable to the Party's nature.

In the current efforts to further rectify and deepen reforms, we should even more strongly advocate the concepts of "one chessboard" and "relay baton," and can use them as a touchstone to measure whether the Party's local cadres have pure Party nature.

### “一盘棋”与“接力棒”

    “一盘棋”与“接力棒”
    维伟
    这几年，一些地区有人不断叫喊“种粮吃亏”，而嘉鱼的农业却年年稳步发展，因为他们树立了“一盘棋思想”；当不少地方为求近利，乱砍滥伐屡禁不止时，嘉鱼的“县官”却乐于干“前人栽树，后人乘凉”的造林事业，这是因为他们树立了“接力棒”思想。
    “一盘棋”思想，“接力棒”思想，提倡的是顾全国家大局和照顾人民的长远利益。
    树立“一盘棋”思想，就是时刻想到自己是国家这个“大棋盘”上的一个“子”，每行一步，都要照顾全盘，必要时要不惜付出一定代价，而不能我行我素，绝不能做有损大局的事情。
    树立“接力棒”思想，就是在自己的任职期间为一个地方的事业发展起好“承上启下”的作用，而不能不顾当地工作的连续性，片面地追求短期效应，贪求“近功”。共产党的“地方官”是要为全党的利益而奋斗的，地方主义、分散主义、功利主义等等，都是为共产党的党性所不容的。
    在当前进一步治理整顿、深化改革的工作中，我们更应提倡“一盘棋”思想和“接力棒”思想，甚至可以将它作为衡量党的地方干部的党性是否纯正的试金石。
