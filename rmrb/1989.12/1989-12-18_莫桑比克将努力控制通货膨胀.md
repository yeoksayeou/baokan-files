Mozambique will prioritize controlling inflation and maintaining stable economic growth in its national plan for next year, Prime Minister Mario Machungo announced today at the 7th People's Assembly.

He said his government plans to reduce the inflation rate from this year's approximately 40% to between 15% and 18% by December next year.

He emphasized that the government is determined to lower the inflation rate through measures such as controlling public expenditure, tightening monetary policy, and continuing to make military spending more reasonable.

The second major goal of the country's plan for next year is to ensure stable economic development, maintaining a gross domestic product growth rate of between 4% and 0%.
