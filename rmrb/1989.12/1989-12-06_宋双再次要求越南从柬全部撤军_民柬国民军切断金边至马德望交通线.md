	Song Seng, the Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, reiterated his demand today in Paris for the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, allowing the Cambodian people to determine their own fate without external pressure.

	In a meeting with foreign journalists at his residence, Song Seng emphasized that Vietnam has not truly withdrawn its troops. Vietnamese armed personnel are still hidden within the military of the Phnom Penh government, and illegal Vietnamese "immigrants" remain in Cambodia. He stated that for the Cambodian people to hold free elections under full sovereignty, the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is a prerequisite.

	In a statement read to the journalists, Song Seng called on the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union to intervene with Vietnam and the Phnom Penh government, urging them to return to the negotiating table on the Cambodian issue. He also urged the early resumption of the international conference on Cambodia in Paris.

	Song Seng also pointed out that there have been many proposed solutions to the Cambodian issue, but many of these plans lack practical significance. He firmly opposed the suggestion that Cambodia's seat in the United Nations be left vacant.

	Prime Minister Song Seng arrived in Paris from the United States on November 26 after attending the United Nations General Assembly.

	According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea radio station today, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea blew up one railway bridge and one road bridge in Mong County, Banteay Meanchey Province, completely cutting off the transportation line between Phnom Penh and Battambang.

	The broadcast said that on November 26, the National Army attacked and blew up a 20-meter-long railway bridge at Ousapha and a road bridge near the Sre Ambel railway station on National Highway 5. To this day, two trains and a long line of cars are still blocked east of the Sre Ambel railway station, unable to proceed west.

	The radio station also reported that the National Army, which had advanced into Takeo Province, continuously attacked the Vietnamese puppet forces at the end of November, destroying five large bridges and eight small bridges on National Highway 6, paralyzing this important road in Takeo Province. The National Army also liberated three towns and 24 villages along National Highway 6, including the town of Trakok and the villages of Dey Be in Pursat District, killing 10 enemy soldiers and wounding 15. They also dispersed 130 members of the puppet local government and puppet soldiers, and released 50 civilians who had been detained.

	The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea also destroyed two Vietnamese military outposts in Battambang Province, south of Sandaun Mountain and east of Ousapha, on November 26 and 27, killing 41 Vietnamese soldiers and wounding 47.

    宋双再次要求越南从柬全部撤军
    民柬国民军切断金边至马德望交通线
    新华社巴黎12月4日电　民柬联合政府总理宋双今天在巴黎再次要求越南从柬埔寨撤走全部军队，使柬埔寨人民在没有外来压力的情况下决定自己的命运。
    宋双在他的寓所中会见外国记者时强调，越南并没有实现真正的撤军，它的武装人员仍隐藏在金边政权的军队之中，非法的越南“移民”也依然留在柬埔寨。他说，为了使柬埔寨人民能够在享有充分主权的情况下进行自由选举，必须以越南全部撤军作为先决条件。
    宋双在向记者宣读的一份声明中呼吁美苏两国领导人对越南和金边政权进行干预，迫使它们重新回到有关柬埔寨问题的谈判桌上来。他还要求柬埔寨国际会议能够尽快在巴黎复会。
    宋双还指出，目前出现了不少有关柬埔寨问题的解决方案，但很多计划都缺乏现实意义。他表示坚决反对关于柬埔寨在联合国的席位保持空缺的建议。
    宋双总理是在参加完联大会议之后于11月26日由美国抵达巴黎的。
    新华社北京12月5日电　据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民柬国民军在菩萨省蒙县炸毁铁路、公路桥各一座，从而完全切断了金边至马德望的交通运输线。

    另据这家电台广播，深入磅同省的民柬国民军11月底也连续袭击越伪军，炸毁6号公路上5座大桥、8座小桥，使这条重要公路在磅同省内处于瘫痪。国民军还解放6号公路沿线的磅斯外县的三戈镇和德贝等4个乡24个村庄，打死敌军10名，打伤15名，并遣散了伪乡村政权人员和伪军130人，释放了被关押的50名老百姓。
