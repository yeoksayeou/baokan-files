Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th.

The People's Daily, December 15th, Beijing - The People's Daily reporter Yuan Jianda and Xinhua News Agency reporter He Ping report: Today, in the afternoon, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Jiang Zemin met with all delegates attending the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) Second Plenary Session.

Jiang Zemin first extended his sincere congratulations on the convening of the 12th Central Committee of the CYLC Second Plenary Session and expressed his hope that everyone would make this meeting a success.

Jiang Zemin said that the leadership of the Party, including the role of the Communist Youth League as an assistant to the Party, is very important. We have 48 million Party members and 56 million League members. The key is quality, and we must continuously improve the quality of our Party members and League members. If Party members and League members have high quality, they can play a tremendous role.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that the situation in our country is stable. First, because our Party is a Party that has been tempered through countless trials and tribulations. Although there are still many problems, overall, our Party is good and truly connected with the masses, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Second, our army is a people's army that has been tested and tempered through countless battles under the absolute leadership of the Party and is closely connected with the masses. Third, our country and our nation have a history of brave struggle and never yielding. This is something that Chinese people should not belittle.

Jiang Zemin hoped that the broad cadre and members of the Communist Youth League would increase their confidence, boost their spirits, and through the wide range of youth they are connected with, work hard to complete the tasks proposed by the 13th Central Committee of the CPC Fifth Plenary Session.

Also present at the meeting were CPC Central Political Bureau Standing Committee member Song Ping and CPC Central Political Bureau candidate and Secretariat member Ding Guanggen, who also attended the meeting and spoke at the 12th Central Committee of the CYLC Second Plenary Session on the issue of implementing the spirit of the 13th Central Committee of the CPC Fifth Plenary Session and doing a good job in the work of the Communist Youth League.

Ding Guanggen said that at present, we must use the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session to unify our thoughts and actions. The most important thing is to focus on two major tasks: first, to maintain political stability and unity, and second, to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy through rectification and deepening of reforms. Without a stable and united political environment, economic construction cannot proceed normally, and it is impossible to talk about further rectification and deepening of reforms. The achievements of construction and reform will also be lost. Similarly, if the economy cannot achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development, it will increase social instability factors, and political stability and unity cannot be maintained for a long time. Both tasks are crucial.

Ding Guanggen said that we must firmly maintain the political situation of stability and unity. After the Party's work focus shifted to economic construction, we must adhere to the "two basic points" of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, and oppose bourgeois liberalization. We must be highly vigilant against the hostile forces abroad attempting to subvert and engage in peaceful evolution against our country. In the face of the onslaught of bourgeois liberalization forces, we must not compromise or retreat, as retreat is a dead end. We must strengthen Party building, maintain close ties with the masses, and serve the people wholeheartedly. We must strengthen ideological and political work, strengthen socialist and communist ideological education, and strengthen patriotic and collectivist education. We must care for the younger generation and do a good job in their ideological education, encouraging and guiding them to carry forward the cause started by their predecessors.

Ding Guanggen pointed out that to do a good job in rectification and deepening of reforms, we must see the current economic difficulties, boost our spirits, strengthen our confidence, and enhance our courage to overcome difficulties. Boosting spirits must start with Communist Party members and League members, playing a model role. Everyone must always put national interests first and consciously ensure that local interests serve the overall interests. League organizations must be in solidarity with the Party, and League leaders at all levels must take the lead in tightening their belts for a few years, leading the broad masses of League members and youth to deeply carry out the "double increase, double saving" campaign and contribute to the cause of construction and reform.

Ding Guanggen emphasized that the Communist Youth League must resolutely uphold the Party's leadership and maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee in politics, ideology, and action. "Where the Party calls, the League acts," and "where the Party points, the League goes" has always been the glorious tradition of the League. He required that the Communist Youth League should focus on enhancing its advanced nature. The Communist Youth League without mass character will be detached from the masses of youth; without advanced nature, it cannot lead the youth forward. The attraction, cohesion, and combat effectiveness of the Communist Youth League ultimately come from its advanced nature. Broad League members must seriously use Lei Feng's spirit to regulate their thoughts and actions, always be loyal to the Party and the people, and dedicate their limited lives to the infinite service of the people. The Communist Youth League should closely revolve around the tasks stipulated by the Fifth Plenary Session, do more practical work, and definitely face the grassroots and serve the grassroots. He said that whether the grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League have combat effectiveness should be an important standard for examining and evaluating the leadership organs of the League. Grasping the grassroots requires perseverance and hard work. As long as the grassroots organizations of the League truly become the bond between the Party and the youth, the work of the League will definitely present a lively and colorful situation.

Ding Guanggen pointed out that we are at a critical moment for revitalizing China and building modernization. The broad masses of young people should enhance their sense of urgency and responsibility. A nation that wants to revitalize must have a spirit of shared hardship. All League members should have the spirit of taking the world as their responsibility, dedicating their youth to the people, and repaying the country. He hoped that the Communist Youth League would become an important force in stabilizing society and achieve outstanding results for the Party, the country, and the people in rectification and deepening of reforms.

    江泽民宋平等会见团中央全会同志强调
    提高团员素质发挥团组织作用
    丁关根讲话要求用党的五中全会精神统一思想和行动
    江泽民分析我国局势稳定的原因：
    我们这个党是千锤百炼的党；我们的军队是党绝对领导下的久经考验、身经百战的人民军队；我们的国家、我们的民族有着英勇奋斗、从不屈服的历史传统。
    本报北京12月15日讯　本报记者袁建达、新华社记者何平报道：中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在人民大会堂会见了出席共青团十二届二中全会的全体同志。
    江泽民首先对团中央十二届二中全会的召开表示衷心祝贺，并希望大家把这次会议开好。
    江泽民说，党的领导，包括党的助手共青团组织的作用是非常重要的。我们有4800万党员，5600万团员，数量不少，但关键是质量，要不断提高我们党员和团员的素质。党员、团员的素质好，就能发挥出巨大的作用。
    江泽民指出，我们国家的局势是稳定的。首先因为，我们这个党是千锤百炼的党，尽管还存在不少问题，但从总体上说，我们党是好的，是真正与群众有着密切联系，用马列主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党。其次，我们的军队是在党的绝对领导下的久经考验、身经百战的人民军队，与人民群众有着密切联系。第三，我们的国家、我们的民族有着英勇奋斗、从不屈服的历史传统，这一点中国人不能妄自菲薄。
    江泽民希望广大共青团干部和团员增强信心，振奋精神，并通过所联系的广大青年，为完成党的第十三届五中全会所提出的任务而努力工作。
    参加会见的还有中共中央政治局常委宋平，中共中央政治局候补委员、书记处书记丁关根今天也参加了会见并出席了共青团十二届二中全会，同时就贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神、做好共青团工作问题讲了话。
    丁关根说，当前，我们要用五中全会精神统一思想、统一行动，最重要的是紧紧抓好两件大事：一是在政治上保持安定团结，二是在经济上经过治理整顿、深化改革使国民经济走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。没有一个安定团结的政治环境，经济建设就无法正常进行，就谈不上进一步治理整顿和深化改革，已经取得的建设和改革的成果也会丧失殆尽。同样，如果经济不能持续、稳定、协调发展，就会增加社会上的不安定因素，政治上的安定团结也就不可能长期保持下去。两件大事都至关重要。
    丁关根说，要坚定不移地维护安定团结的政治局面。在党的工作重点转向以经济建设为中心以后，一定要坚持四项基本原则和改革开放“两个基本点”，反对资产阶级自由化。要高度警惕国外敌对势力对我国搞颠覆，搞和平演变。在资产阶级自由化势力进攻面前，决不能妥协退让，退让是没有出路的。要加强党的建设，密切联系群众，全心全意为人民服务。要大力加强思想政治工作，加强社会主义和共产主义思想教育，加强爱国主义和集体主义教育。要关心青年一代，做好青年一代的思想教育工作，鼓励和引导他们把先辈开创的事业发扬光大。
    丁关根指出，做好治理整顿、深化改革工作，既要看到当前的经济困难，又要振奋精神、增强信心，提高克服困难的勇气。振奋精神，首先要从共产党员和共青团员做起，发挥党、团员的模范作用。大家要时时刻刻把国家利益放在第一位，自觉做到局部利益服从整体利益。团组织必须和党同心同德，团的各级领导干部要带头过几年紧日子，带动广大团员、青年深入开展“双增双节”运动，为建设和改革事业做出贡献。
    丁关根强调，共青团一定要坚决维护党的领导，在政治上、思想上、行动上与党中央保持高度一致。“党有号召，团有行动”，“党指向哪里，团奔向哪里”历来是团的光荣传统。他要求，共青团要在增强先进性上下功夫。共青团没有群众性，就会脱离青年群众；没有先进性，就无法带领青年前进。共青团的吸引力、凝聚力、战斗力，归根结底来自先进性。广大共青团员要认真用雷锋精神规范自己的思想行动，永远忠于党、忠于人民，把有限的生命投入到无限的为人民服务之中去。共青团要紧紧围绕五中全会规定的任务，多做实实在在的工作。一定要面向基层，切实为基层服务。他说，要把共青团基层组织是否具有战斗力作为检查和考核团的领导机关的一个重要标准。抓基层要持之以恒，下苦功夫。只要团的基层组织真正成为党联系青年的纽带，团的工作必然会出现生气勃勃、万紫千红的局面。
    丁关根同志最后指出，我们正处在振兴中华、建设四化的关键时刻，广大青年应该增强紧迫感、责任感。一个民族要振兴，就应有一种共渡时艰的民气。全体共青团员要有以天下为己任的气概，把自己的青春奉献人民，报效国家。他希望共青团成为稳定社会的一支重要力量，在治理整顿、深化改革中为党、为国家、为人民创造出优异的成绩。（附图片）
