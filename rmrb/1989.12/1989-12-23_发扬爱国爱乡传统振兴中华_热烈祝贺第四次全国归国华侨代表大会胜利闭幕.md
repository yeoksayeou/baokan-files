The Fourth National Conference of Returned Overseas Chinese Representatives has successfully concluded. We extend our heartfelt congratulations on the conference's complete success.

Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, attended the opening ceremony on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and delivered an important speech. He highly praised the patriotism and dedication shown by returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese in the great cause of revitalizing China, as well as the significant achievements they have made. He fully affirmed the correctness of the policies and guidelines for overseas Chinese work since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and the achievements of the work of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. He also pointed out the direction for overseas Chinese work in the 1990s. This reflects the Party's consistent attention, care, and expectations for the tens of millions of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese work has always been a long-term and important task for the Party and the state. In this new historical period, overseas Chinese work has become increasingly important. Now, as history is about to enter the 1990s, the next decade is a crucial period for achieving the overall strategic goals of China's socialist modernization, and a critical juncture that will determine the rise and fall of the Chinese nation in the coming century. We will continue to adhere to the correct lines, policies, and guidelines that have proven effective over the past decade. The basic state policy of opening up to the outside world will remain unchanged, and the policies and guidelines for overseas Chinese work will also remain unchanged. It can be believed that with the deepening of reform and opening up, our overseas Chinese work will surely usher in a new situation.

This conference was held at an important time. Currently, the people of the entire nation are deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee, maintaining national stability and unity, and ensuring stable, coordinated, and sustained economic growth. They are enthusiastically facing the new challenges of the 1990s. This shows that the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese are closely linked with the destiny of the socialist motherland.

Patriotism and love for the homeland are the glorious traditions of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese have wandered across five continents, making a living wherever they go, but their hearts are always with the motherland. The history of the overseas Chinese is a history of blood, struggle, and patriotism. For many years, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese have dreamed of having a strong motherland. They have rallied under the banner of patriotism, joining forces with the people of the country to form a powerful force driving the progress of the motherland, and have written brilliant chapters in the history of the Chinese revolution and construction. History has repeatedly proven that "only socialism can save China" and "only socialism can develop China." Loving the motherland means loving the socialist motherland; loving the homeland means loving the socialist homeland. Although the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese have encountered many ups and downs on their journey forward, their patriotism has always remained steadfast.

Through this conference, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese has a clear guiding ideology, a new charter, and a new leadership. It will surely more resolutely implement the series of guidelines and policies for overseas Chinese work since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. There is much to be done at all levels of the Federation. The main tasks for the future are: to strive to protect the legal and legitimate rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese, promote their unity and mutual assistance, encourage them to carry forward the tradition of loving the motherland and the homeland, and further promote economic and cultural exchanges and friendly cooperation between overseas and China; to encourage returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to exert their wisdom and talents in their respective positions to contribute to the prosperity and progress of the motherland. We should fully utilize the advantages of the Federation's close ties with overseas, build bridges, continue to introduce funds, technology, and talent, actively support and develop overseas Chinese enterprises, and better serve the economic construction of the motherland. At the same time, we should actively organize and guide returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to participate in the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law, play a role in democratic participation and supervision, and promote clean governance. We should further carry out overseas friendship activities, promote friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of the world, and increase contact and understanding between the descendants of the Yellow Emperor on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We should also seriously strengthen the construction of the Federation itself, face the grassroots and the masses, promote democracy, and make the Federation a vibrant and dynamic organization. It can be believed that the Federation will better play the role of a bridge and a bond, truly becoming a "home for returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese."

The broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese are a great force in the revolution and construction of our great motherland. In the past century, they have made indelible contributions to the independence of the country, the liberation of the nation, and the construction of the motherland. Today, as the 1990s are about to arrive, at this crucial moment that will determine the destiny of the Chinese nation, they will surely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, continue to carry forward the tradition of patriotism and love for the homeland, and make greater contributions to the modernization of the motherland, the great cause of national reunification, and the maintenance of world peace.

    发扬爱国爱乡传统振兴中华
    ——热烈祝贺第四次全国归国华侨代表大会胜利闭幕
    第四次全国归国华侨代表大会胜利闭幕了，我们热烈祝贺大会圆满成功。
    中共中央总书记江泽民代表党中央和国务院出席开幕式并发表重要讲话。他高度评价归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞在振兴中华的伟大事业中表现出的爱国主义献身精神和建立的丰功伟绩，充分肯定党的十一届三中全会以来侨务工作的各项方针政策的正确和侨联工作的成绩，并且指明90年代侨务工作的方向。这体现了党对几千万归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞的一贯重视、关怀和厚望。
    侨务工作历来是党和国家的一项长期、重要的工作。在新的历史时期，侨务工作显得越来越重要了。现在，历史即将跨入90年代，今后的十年是实现我国社会主义现代化总体战略目标的关键阶段，是决定中华民族未来世纪兴衰荣辱的紧要关头。我们将继续实行过去十年中那些行之有效的路线、方针、政策。对外开放的基本国策不变，侨务工作的各项方针、政策也不变。可以相信，随着改革开放的深入发展，我们的侨务工作必将出现一个崭新的局面。
    这次代表大会是在重要时刻召开的。当前，全国人民正在深入学习和贯彻党的十三届四中全会和五中全会精神，保持全国的安定团结和经济的稳定、协调、持续增长，意气风发地迎接90年代新挑战。这表明，广大归侨、侨眷、海外侨胞与社会主义祖国的命运息息相关。
    爱国爱乡是归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞的光荣传统。广大华侨漂泊五洲，四海为业，心系祖国。一部华侨史，就是一部华侨血泪史、奋斗史和爱国史。多少年来，归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞都梦寐以求有一个强盛的祖国。他们凝聚在爱国主义的旗帜下，同国内广大人民汇合成了一股推进祖国进步的强大力量，在中国革命史和建设史上谱写了光辉的篇章。历史一再证明，“只有社会主义才能救中国”，“只有社会主义才能发展中国”。爱祖国，是爱社会主义祖国；爱家乡，是爱社会主义家乡。广大归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞在前进的道路上，尽管遇到过许多坎坎坷坷，但他们的爱国之心，始终坚定不移。
    通过这次大会，全国侨联有了明确的指导思想，有了新的章程，又有了一个新的领导机构，一定会更加坚决贯彻党的十一届三中全会以来制定的一系列侨务工作方针和政策。各级侨联工作大有可为。今后的几项主要工作是：要努力保护归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞的合法和正当权益，促使他们团结互助，鼓励他们发扬爱祖国、爱家乡的传统，进一步推动海外同我国的经济文化交流与友好合作；鼓励归侨、侨眷在各自的岗位上努力发挥聪明才智，为祖国的繁荣进步作出贡献。要充分发挥侨联同海外关系密切的优势，铺路搭桥，继续引进资金、技术和人才，积极扶持和办好侨属企业，更好地为祖国的经济建设服务。同时要积极组织和引导归侨、侨眷参加社会主义民主和法制建设，发挥民主参与、民主监督作用，促进廉政建设。要进一步开展海外联谊活动，促进中国人民和世界各国人民的友好往来，增进海峡两岸炎黄子孙的接触和了解。还要认真搞好侨联自身的建设，面向基层，面向群众，发扬民主，使侨联成为充满生机与活力的组织。可以相信，侨联将会更好地发挥桥梁和纽带作用，真正成为“归侨、侨眷之家”。
    广大归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞是我们伟大祖国革命和建设的一支伟大的力量。在过去的近一个世纪，他们为国家的独立、民族的解放和祖国的建设，立下了不可磨灭的功绩。今天，在90年代即将到来之际，在决定中华民族命运之时，他们也一定会在中国共产党的领导下，继续发扬爱国爱乡的传统，为祖国的四化建设，为祖国的统一大业，为维护世界和平，作出更大的贡献。
