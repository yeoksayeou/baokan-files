A county in Hunan province had a bumper grain harvest and profitable enterprises. Consequently, a Deputy County Head named Li led over 200 people to Mount Nanyue to worship and offer incense, expressing gratitude to the Buddha for his blessings. He also said, "Every year, visiting Mount Nanyue to offer incense is a big event. The leader is always someone of high moral standing. This year, everyone chose me to be the commander." His words were filled with a sense of pride, but this is truly a sad and lamentable situation!

When grain harvests are bountiful and enterprises are profitable, who should be credited? It goes without saying that credit should go to the Party's policies and the people. How can it be attributed to a clay statue? This is truly "ghost-driven." If one day there is a poor harvest and enterprises suffer losses, will it also be blamed on the "gods," and will they be smashed to pieces? If this were the doing of some uneducated, scientifically illiterate, and superstitious ordinary people, it might be somewhat understandable. However, some of our leaders who believe in Marxism-Leninism and advocate materialism are leading the worship of Buddha, which is truly baffling.

In recent years, feudal superstitions have been on the rise. Activities such as building tombs and graves, constructing temples and setting up idols, fortune-telling, and worshipping deities have become increasingly prevalent in some regions. Why is this happening? The key lies in the fact that some grassroots organizations and Party and government officials have failed to stop and severely punish these activities. In fact, some even treat the worship of gods as a "big event" and take the lead in organizing superstitious activities. In a village in Henan province, a replica of an ancient pavilion was built. The upper level is dedicated to all the gods, and the middle level is a room for Party members' activities. Moreover, the Party branch secretary carried whole pigs and sheep to lead the sacrifices. What kind of "fortress" is this Party branch? What kind of "commander" is this branch secretary?

Such Party members, who raise one hand to believe in Marxism-Leninism and the other to believe in ghosts and gods, have actually abandoned their faith in Marxism-Leninism and lost the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member. If such county heads and branch secretaries lead the people to build socialism, where will they lead the people? Shouldn't such Party members be stripped of their "commander" positions? From this, we can see that in some regions, feudal superstitions are rampant. Although the problem lies with the people, the blame should not be placed on them but on the local Party organizations and certain Party members. If grassroots organizations and Party members strengthen education, dare to manage, and lead by example, taking the lead in being "commanders" of Marxism-Leninism and building socialist spiritual civilization, the superstitious activities and ignorant behaviors among the people will be stopped.

    挂什么“帅”？
    史占旗
    湖南省有一个乡粮食丰收、企业盈利，为此，一位李副乡长带领200多人到南岳拜神进香，答谢菩萨的保佑。他还说：“每年到南岳进香是件大事，带队的都是德高望重的人，今年大伙推选我挂帅。”言谈中颇有一点自豪感，其实这是既可悲又可叹的！
    粮食丰收、企业盈利，应该记在谁的帐上？不言而喻，应该记在党的政策的帐上，记在人民群众的帐上，怎么能记在泥巴塑像的帐上？这真是“鬼使神差”了。倘若有一天，粮食欠收、企业亏损，是不是也要记在“尊神老爷”的帐上，把它敲个粉碎呢？在这个问题上，如果是一些没有文化、不懂科学、思想愚昧的普通群众所为，倒还情有可原。然而，我们一些信仰马列主义、大讲唯物主义的领导干部却“挂帅”拜佛，这就不能不使人大惑不解。
    近几年来，封建迷信活动大有泛起之势，造坟修墓、建庙立神、看相算命、朝仙拜佛等愚昧行为在一些地区愈演愈烈。原因何在？关键是我们一些基层组织和党政干部对此制止不力，处理不严，甚至有的把敬神拜仙当成“一件大事”，去“挂”搞迷信活动之“帅”。河南省有个周家庄盖了一座仿古小楼，上层设天地全神之位，中层设党员活动室，而且支部书记抬着整猪全羊带头祭奠。这样的党支部到底是什么样的“战斗堡垒”？这样的支部书记到底“挂”的什么“帅”？
    这种“举起左手信马列，举起右手信鬼神”的党员，实际上完全丢掉了对马列主义的信仰，丧失了一个共产党员的基本条件，让这样的乡长和支书带领群众搞社会主义，会把群众带向何方？对于这样的党员干部，难道不应该剥夺他们的“帅位”吗！由此观之，有些地区封建迷信活动猖獗，尽管问题出在群众身上，但帐不应记在他们身上，而应记在那里的党组织的身上，记在某些党员干部的身上。如果基层组织和党员干部加强教育、敢抓敢管，并身体力行，“挂”马列主义之“帅”，“挂”建设社会主义精神文明之“帅”，群众中的迷信活动和愚昧行为就会制止。
