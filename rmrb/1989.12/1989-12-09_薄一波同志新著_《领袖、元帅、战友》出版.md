People's Daily reports: Comrade Bo Yibo's book "Leaders, Marshals, Comrades" has been published this month by the Central Party School Press of the Communist Party of China.

The book compiles the author's recent writings about the late leaders of the Party, state, and military, including Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Chen Yi, Ye Jianying, Li Fuchun, and Teng Daiyuan, totaling 150,000 words.

In the book, the author, based on his personal experiences and interactions over more than 60 years of revolutionary and construction activities, vividly recounts the historical activities, revolutionary deeds, thoughts, styles, interests, and foresight of the aforementioned figures. The book not only provides many little-known historical facts but also pays attention to summarizing the valuable experiences of China's revolutionary struggles and economic construction from a historical perspective. It elucidates the Party's lines, policies, and leadership art in some periods. The book's reminiscences and evaluations of individuals and events strive to be objective and balanced, with a powerful and straightforward tone, primarily narrative with occasional comments, making it distinctive. Therefore, this book is undoubtedly meaningful for helping the broad masses of Party members, cadres, the public, and youth to understand the Party's history, understand and carry forward the Party's fine traditions, and learn from the revolutionary predecessors' struggle deeds, noble character, and communist spirit of dedication. It is also beneficial for Party history researchers and Party affairs workers to study the Party's history and historical experiences.
