In 1989, Colombia launched an unprecedented campaign against drug trafficking, significantly escalating the anti-drug efforts in Latin America. This initiative is fostering a united front between drug-producing and consuming countries to combat the drug problem.

For many years, the fight against drug trafficking organizations has been one of Colombia's most pressing domestic issues. This year, as the Barco government intensified its anti-drug measures, powerful drug cartels retaliated with increased violence, attempting to thwart the anti-drug campaign through terrorist tactics. In mid-August, hired assassins from the drug cartels murdered Bogotá's renowned judge César Gaviria, the police chief of Antioquia province, Colonel Valdemar Franklin Quintero, and the prominent politician and presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán. These atrocities outraged the Colombian people and galvanized the Barco government to declare an all-out war against the drug cartels. Following Galán's assassination, President Barco immediately announced a comprehensive war against the drug cartels, marking a new phase in Colombia's anti-drug struggle.

In this anti-drug campaign, the Colombian government has taken a clear stance, targeting the key figures within the drug cartels. In the first month of the operation, the government deployed over 20,000 military and police personnel, supported by aircraft and tanks, to conduct large-scale raids across the country. They searched over 2,000 estates, factories, and offices, destroying hundreds of secret drug labs and clandestine airstrips, arresting over 10,000 suspects, and seizing a large number of aircraft, vehicles, and weapons. The luxurious residences of the notorious drug lords from the Medellín and Cali cartels were also raided and occupied. On December 15, the second-in-command of the Medellín Cartel, Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, was killed by the police. These actions have dealt a significant blow to the drug cartels.

The Colombian government's resolve is evident in its insistence on extraditing notorious international drug criminals to the United States and its refusal to negotiate with the drug cartels. The restoration of the U.S.-Colombia extradition agreement is a major measure by the authorities to combat the drug cartels and is the most feared and vehemently opposed action by the cartels. The Medellín Cartel threatened that for every drug trafficker extradited, they would kill ten judges. Indeed, each extradition has led to a new wave of violence in Colombia. Since late August, armed groups affiliated with the drug cartels have been carrying out bombings and assassinations almost daily, creating a highly tense atmosphere nationwide.

Colombia's anti-drug campaign has significant implications for the anti-drug efforts in Latin America and the international community. The cultivation and processing of cocaine primarily occur in Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. Peru and Bolivia are the main producers of the coca plant, which is processed into cocaine paste and then shipped to Colombia. Colombian drug cartels further refine it into high-purity cocaine, which is then smuggled through Central America and the Caribbean to countries like the United States. Therefore, 80% of the cocaine on the U.S. market originates from Colombia.

Moreover, Colombia's anti-drug efforts have promoted a trend towards international cooperation in the fight against drugs. For a long time, the U.S. government and Latin American countries have had differing opinions on how to eradicate the drug problem. With the Colombian government's resolute stance against drugs and the significant sacrifices made, U.S. President Bush announced a new anti-drug plan on September 5, responding to the Colombian government's efforts. This plan expands anti-drug assistance to Latin American countries and strengthens domestic drug control, particularly against cocaine, which has been welcomed by Latin American countries. On October 10, the presidents of Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia met in Ica, Peru, to discuss anti-drug strategies and invited President Bush and European leaders to hold a high-level meeting on the issue. This initiative was immediately supported by President Bush and French President Mitterrand. The high-level meeting is scheduled for February next year in Cartagena, Colombia. Additionally, the United States, Italy, and Spain reached an agreement in October to jointly provide assistance to Latin American countries, helping to train police, share intelligence, and protect judges. The United Kingdom and France have also sent experts to Colombia to provide similar assistance.

However, whether from an internal or external perspective, Latin American countries face significant challenges in the fight against drugs, and the campaign will be long and arduous. Domestically, drug cartels, with their vast financial resources accumulated over the years, have entrenched themselves in various social strata. The cartels' violent actions have also created immense psychological pressure for many people, making it possible for the anti-drug campaign to falter midway. Externally, Western countries struggle to eliminate drug abuse and cannot provide sufficient economic aid to Latin American countries to implement alternative crop programs. How to implement these alternative programs may become a contentious issue in the high-level meeting between Western countries and Latin American countries on the drug problem.

    “扫毒”正未有穷期
    ——拉美反毒斗争回顾
    本报记者　朱满庭
    今年，哥伦比亚爆发了一场规模空前的扫毒战，它使拉美地区的扫毒斗争出现了巨大的声势。在它的影响下，一个由毒品生产国和消费国联合起来，共同对付毒品问题的局面正在形成。
    多年来，对贩毒集团的斗争，一直是哥伦比亚最主要的国内问题之一。今年，随着巴尔科政府加紧采取剿毒行动，势力强大的贩毒集团也日益猖狂地反扑，企图以恐怖暗杀手段阻止肃毒斗争的展开。8月中旬，贩毒集团雇佣的杀手先后杀害了波哥大著名大法官加西亚、安蒂奥基亚省警察局长金德罗上校和著名政治家、自由党总统候选人加兰。这些暴行激怒了哥伦比亚全国人民，也使巴尔科政府下了最大决心与贩毒集团决战到底。加兰遇害后，巴尔科总统当即宣布与贩毒集团展开一场全面战争，使哥伦比亚的反毒斗争进入了新的阶段。
    在这场反毒战中，哥伦比亚政府态度鲜明，斗争矛头直指贩毒集团的首恶分子。在扫毒战的头一个多月中，政府集中出动了两万多名军警，在飞机和坦克的支援下，在全国范围大规模清剿，抄查了2000多个庄园、工厂、办公楼，摧毁了数以百计的秘密毒品加工厂和秘密机场，逮捕了万余名嫌疑犯，缴获了大批飞机、汽车和武器弹药。国际最有名的大毒王、麦德林卡特尔集团和卡利卡特尔集团的首领们的豪华住宅都受到抄查、占领。12月15日，麦德林卡特尔贩毒集团第二号头目贡萨洛·罗德里格斯·加查被警方击毙。这一切给贩毒集团以沉重打击。
    哥伦比亚政府态度的坚定性突出地表现在坚持把著名国际毒犯引渡到美国的政策和绝不与贩毒集团和谈这两个方面。恢复美哥引渡协议是当局打击贩毒集团的重大措施，也是贩毒集团最害怕、反对最激烈的措施。麦德林卡特尔集团宣称政府每引渡一名毒贩，他们就要处死10名法官。确实，政府每引渡一个毒犯，哥伦比亚就出现一股新的暴力浪潮。8月下旬以来，贩毒集团武装组织几乎天天制造爆炸或暗杀事件，全国的气氛高度紧张。
    哥伦比亚的扫毒战对拉美乃至整个国际社会的反毒斗争都具有重大意义。可卡因的种植与加工提炼，主要集中在南美的玻利维亚、秘鲁和哥伦比亚。秘鲁、玻利维亚是提炼可卡因的作物古柯的主要种植国，古柯叶在这两个国家初步加工成可卡因膏输入哥伦比亚，哥伦比亚的贩毒集团再进一步提炼成高纯度的可卡因，然后经过中美洲和加勒比地区走私到美国等国。因此，美国市场上80％的可卡因来自哥伦比亚。
    更重要的是，哥伦比亚的反毒战促进了国际反毒斗争中的联合趋势。长期以来，美国当局与拉美国家在如何消灭毒品问题上意见并不一致。在哥伦比亚政府坚决肃毒，并为此付出了重大代价的情况下，美国总统布什在9月5日宣布了新的反毒品计划，对哥伦比亚政府作出了响应。这个计划一方面扩大了对拉美国家的扫毒援助，另一方面也加强了对国内毒品尤其是可卡因的控制，从而受到拉美国家的欢迎。今年10月10日，玻、秘、哥三国总统在秘鲁伊卡举行会晤，专门研究了反毒战略，并邀请布什和欧洲国家领导人就此举行高级会议。这一倡议立即得到美国总统布什和法国总统密特朗的响应。这一高级会晤预计明年2月在哥伦比亚的卡特赫纳召开。此外，美国、意大利和西班牙在10月份也达成协议，联合起来共同向拉美国家提供援助，帮助拉美国家训练警察，分享有关情报，保护法官等。英国、法国已向哥伦比亚派出专家，提供类似的援助。
    不过无论从内部或是外部的情况看，拉美国家在扫毒问题上面临的困难都很大，扫毒将是长期、艰苦的斗争。从国内情况看，贩毒集团依靠多年来积蓄起来的巨大财力，在社会各阶层都扎下了根基，贩毒集团疯狂的恐怖行动也给不少人带来巨大的心理压力，因此，扫毒战半途而废的可能性确实存在。另外，从外部情况看，西方国家难以消除吸毒问题，也无法向拉美国家提供足够的经济援助，以实行古柯的替代种植计划。如何落实替代种植计划，很可能成为西方国家和拉美国家在毒品问题高级会晤中的一个争议问题。
