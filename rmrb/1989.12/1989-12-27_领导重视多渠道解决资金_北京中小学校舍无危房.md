People's Daily, Beijing, December 26th - Reporter Yan Shigu reports: The work of repairing and renovating dangerous buildings in Beijing's primary and secondary schools has been completed, meeting the requirement proposed by Mayor Chen Xi at the beginning of the year during the municipal People's Congress.

The Municipal Education Bureau today provided information to the reporter, stating that since 1981, when the city began to address this issue, by 1985, over 500,000 square meters of dangerous buildings that had accumulated over the years had been basically resolved. Since then, any dangerous buildings discovered in a given year were repaired and renovated within the same year. Statistics show that from 1981 to 1989, the city repaired and renovated over 1.5 million square meters of dangerous buildings in primary and secondary schools; not only was personal safety ensured, but the conditions for education were also improved.

The Beijing Municipal Government attaches great importance to the repair and renovation of dangerous buildings in primary and secondary schools and has taken a series of effective measures: streamlining the management system, changing from the previous management by the Housing Bureau to management by the Education Bureau, and establishing specialized agencies at the municipal and district levels to organize and implement the work; conducting inspections and registrations of dangerous buildings one by one, and formulating renovation plans; solving funding issues through multiple channels, with an investment of 430 million yuan over the past few years, of which 200 million yuan was provided by the municipal government; establishing a responsibility system, with responsibilities at all levels.
