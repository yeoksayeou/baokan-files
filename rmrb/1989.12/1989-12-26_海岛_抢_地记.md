A strong northwest wind howled over the "Qianzhang Pond" field in the central part of Liuheng Island in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province. A large crowd of people gathered there, shouting loudly: "Village Head She, we want to jointly contract 8 mu of land!" "Leave 2 mu for me!" The village director was recording in his notebook. In less than an hour, the 23.4 mu of land that had been left fallow for many years was all contracted. This happened on the afternoon of November 16 in Zhangjiatang Village, Shuangtang Township, Putuo District.

Village Director She Quanguang, holding a measuring tape, was measuring and loudly telling the reporter, "This field was reclaimed from the sea in the 1960s. Due to the soil being alkaline and compacted, the yield has been low for many years. In the past few years, during the implementation of the 'Household Responsibility System,' no one wanted it. Later, the village had to forcibly allocate it to each household. Over the years, most farmers did not cultivate it, and some did not even know where their allocated land was. Therefore, this place has been overgrown with weeds for many years."

In early November, a work team from Zhoushan City went to Shuangtang Township and, together with the township and village leaders, decided to use the labor of township government officials and work team members to plow and level the fallow land for free, and then contract it to farmers to grow spring crops. Unexpectedly, before the land was fully prepared, more than ten households of farmers had already "rushed" to the edge of the field to "rush" for it.

At this time, a local farmer, Zheng Rongguo, rushed to the village director and said, "We, a few farmers working at the township salt field, have discussed and decided to contract 8 mu of land. We will use the early morning and evening and the spare time during salt drying to grow crops, so we can buy less rationed grain." His attitude was very firm.

Young farmer Xia Guoyue said, "My family of three has only 3 fen of paddy field and 1 mu of dry land, which is not enough for our grain needs. I plan to grow crops on the newly contracted 2 mu of land."

Seventy-seven-year-old Mr. Yang Xiaoping walked for over 40 minutes to "Qianzhang Pond" after hearing the news on the radio. He insisted on having 1 mu of land reserved for him.

At the edge of the field, there was a middle-aged woman named Wang Shijuo, who had been quietly waiting. There were 3 fen of land allocated to her family by the village in 1982, which she had never left fallow. Now, she and her husband, who operates an individual transportation boat, have agreed to contract another 1 mu of land. She asked her husband to help her more when he returns to the port to rest, and she also plans to raise more pigs to accumulate fertilizer.

The northwest wind continued to blow, and the faces of the farmers who had "rushed" for the land were filled with smiles.

    海岛“抢”地记
    徐博龙
    强西北风在浙江省舟山市六横岛腹部的“千丈塘”地畈呼啸。地畈上围着一大群人在高声叫嚷：“谢村长，我们联合承包8亩！”“给我留2亩！”村主任在笔记本上记着。不到1小时，抛荒多年的23.4亩土地全包完了。这是11月16日下午，普陀区双塘乡张家塘村发生的农民“抢”地种粮食的事。
    村主任谢全国拿着皮尺边丈量边大声告诉笔者，这畈土地是60年代海涂围垦起来的，因土壤碱重板结，产量历年不高。前些年实行“大包干”时，谁家都不要。后来，村里只好硬分给各户。几年来，多数农户没去耕种，有的连地分在哪里也不知道。因此，这里常年杂草丛生。
    11月初，舟山市区工作组到双塘乡后，与乡村负责人共同商量决定，利用乡机关干部和工作组人员义务劳动，将这畈荒地翻耕平整后再承包给农户种春粮。没想到，土地还没整完，十几户农民就“挤”在地边“抢”开了。
    这时，本村农民郑荣国抢先对村主任说，我们在乡盐场做工的几个农民商量好承包8亩，利用早晚和晒盐空闲时间种粮食，这样可少买些议价粮。他的态度非常坚决。
    青年农民夏国跃接着说，我家3口人只有3分水田、1亩旱地，粮食不够用。他打算在新承包的2亩土地上种粮食。
    67岁的杨小品大爷从广播里听到消息后，也步行40多分钟赶到“千丈塘”来了，非要求留给他1亩。
    在地边，有位名叫王仕娟的中年妇女，一直静静地等候着。这里有1982年村里包给她家的3分地，她从来没荒过。现在，她又和撑个体运输船的丈夫商量好了，再包1亩，并请丈夫以后回港休息时多帮她一把，自己也准备多养猪积肥。
    西北风还不停地刮着，“抢”到土地的农民脸上绽开了笑容。
