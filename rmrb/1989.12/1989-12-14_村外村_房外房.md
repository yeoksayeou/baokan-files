Title: Villages Outside Villages, Houses Outside Houses

I often encounter a peculiar phenomenon during my visits to rural areas: from a distance, many villages appear to have a cluster of new houses, but upon entering the village, one finds another scene: dilapidated, uninhabited old houses are scattered everywhere. Typically, the old houses within the village remain untouched, while new houses are built on the outskirts, often on fertile farmland. This results in "villages outside villages" and "houses outside houses." In some alleys, dozens of old houses are occupied by only a few elderly residents. According to my survey of fifty households in one village, nearly twenty-eight families have built new houses in recent years, totaling around two hundred ninety rooms. Meanwhile, nearly one hundred old rooms are abandoned and uninhabited.

I believe that the development of rural housing along the path of "villages outside villages, houses outside houses" is extremely wasteful of land. Measures should be taken to restrict the construction of new houses and encourage the renovation of old ones. Perhaps it is possible to stipulate that those who have not renovated their old houses should not be permitted to build new ones.

### 村外村　房外房

    村外村　房外房
    河北省邯郸市索珍贵
    我下乡经常发现，不少村庄远看一片新房，进入村内又是另一番景象：破败不堪、无人居住的旧房比比皆是。大多是村内旧房不动，跑到村外良田上另盖新房，形成村外有村，房外有房。有的胡同几十间旧房仅有三两个老人居住。据我对一个村五十户住户的调查，近几年盖新房的有二十八家，约二百九十多间，遗弃的旧房有近一百间无人居住。
    我感到农村住房沿着“村外村，房外房”这个路子发展太浪费土地，应采取措施限制建造新房，鼓励改造旧房；是否可以明确规定，凡没有对旧房实施改造的，一律不准建新房。
