Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral stated in the parliament today that the governments of India and Sri Lanka are committed to jointly accelerating the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka.

He said that the Indian government has proposed that relevant officials from both countries hold early talks to formulate a withdrawal timeline and explore the possibility of accelerating the withdrawal process.

According to an earlier agreement between the two governments, the 25,000 Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka should have all withdrawn by December 31 of this year.

Gujral said that by December 31, Indian troops will withdraw from six of the eight districts in the eastern and northern provinces of Sri Lanka. He expressed that the complete withdrawal of Indian troops may be completed by March 1990. Indian troops entered the eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka in July 1987 under an agreement signed by India and Sri Lanka.

During the third round of talks held in Islamabad in May regarding the India-Pakistan border, both sides agreed to take specific measures to curb terrorist activities, drug trafficking, smuggling, and illegal immigration in the border regions.

    古杰拉尔说，12月31日前，印军将从斯东北各省的8个县中的6个县撤走。他表示，印度全部撤军有可能到1990年3月完成。印度部队是在1987年7月根据印斯两国签署的一项协议进驻斯东部和北部的。
