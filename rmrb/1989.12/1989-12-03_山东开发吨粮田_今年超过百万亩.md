Shandong province has relied on scientific and technological input to develop agriculture. Despite facing natural disasters such as droughts, this year the province implemented a plan for 1.5 million mu of high-yield fields, achieving an average yield of 987 kilograms per mu. Among these, 1.27 million mu met or exceeded the standard of producing one ton of grain per year. This effort also promoted increased production in 7.5 million mu of farmland.

To implement this production plan, Shandong province established a "High-Yield Field" scientific and technological development leadership group led by a vice governor. Local government leaders in various cities and districts served as the heads of local scientific and technological development leadership groups, coordinating relationships among various departments to ensure that all measures are effectively implemented. Various cities and districts adopted a method of signing contracts in both directions, establishing 237 contract groups at various levels, involving 7,500 people, and forming a new agricultural development mechanism led by science and technology, guided by policy, and guaranteed by investment in funds and materials. This mechanism has mobilized the enthusiasm of all parties.

Currently, in the development zones, more than 95% of townships have established science and technology service stations, and more than 85% of villages have established comprehensive service organizations. Science and technology are now directly entering every household.

    山东开发吨粮田  今年超过百万亩
    本报济南12月2日电　记者蒋建科报道：山东省依靠科技投入发展农业，在遭受干旱等自然灾害的情况下，今年全省实施的150万亩吨粮田平均亩产达到987公斤，其中有127万亩达到或超过年产吨粮的标准，同时带动750万亩田地增产。
    为实施这一增产计划，山东省成立了由一名副省长负责的“吨粮田”科技开发领导小组，各地市主要政府领导人担任地方科技开发领导小组组长，协调各部门关系，保证一切措施落到实处。各地市采取双向签订合同的办法，逐级建立了由行政领导、业务部门和科技人员组成的承包集团237个，涉及7500多人，形成了一个以科技为先导、政策为导向、资金、物质投入为保证的农业开发新机制，调动了各方面的积极性。
    现在，开发区95％以上的乡镇有了科技服务站，85％以上的村建立了综合服务组织，科技正在直接进入千家万户。
