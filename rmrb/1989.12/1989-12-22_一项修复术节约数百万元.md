A repair technique for imported equipment has saved Anhui Ningguo Cement Plant hundreds of millions of yuan.

In January last year, the high-voltage electrostatic precipitator equipment imported by Ningguo Cement Plant, specifically the kiln tail electrostatic precipitator, was damaged by fire. Experts believed that the equipment was completely beyond repair and needed to be replaced.

At a special meeting convened by the State Bureau of Building Materials, Beijing Electrostatic Equipment Factory and Hebei Xuanhua Metallurgical Environmental Protection Equipment Factory boldly proposed: relying on their own technology and using entirely domestically produced materials and components, they could repair the original equipment on-site. The technical personnel from these two factories worked closely together, boldly modifying the original equipment structure, and completed the repair work in just 10 months. The cost was less than 200 million yuan, saving more than two-thirds of the cost compared to the foreign supplier's quote.

    一项修复术节约数百万元
    据新华社北京12月21日电　（通讯员宋瑞琪、记者刘浦泉）一项修复进口设备的技术，使安徽宁国水泥厂节省数百万元。
    去年1月，宁国水泥厂从国外引进高压静电除尘设备——窑尾电收尘器装置被火烧坏。有关专家认为这台设备已完全报废，要重新引进。
    在国家建材总局召开的专门会议上，北京静电设备厂和河北宣化冶金环保设备厂大胆提出：依靠自己的技术，完全采用国产材料和元器件，就地修复原设备。这两个厂的技术人员密切配合，大胆改变了原设备结构，仅用10个月时间就完成了修复任务，费用不到200万元，比外商报价节约开支2／3以上。
