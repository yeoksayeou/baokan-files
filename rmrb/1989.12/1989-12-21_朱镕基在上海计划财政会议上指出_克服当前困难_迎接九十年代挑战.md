	Zhu Rongji, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Mayor, said at the conclusion of the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Financial Work Conference today: To overcome current difficulties and meet the challenges of the 1990s, it is essential to truly implement various rectification and adjustment measures. The fundamental issue is to strengthen party building, ideological and political work, and party discipline, and to work hard to improve the quality of party members and cadres.

	Delegates at the meeting agreed that while the issue raised by Comrade Zhu Rongji is not within the scope of economic planning, it is crucial to the success or failure of next year's economic work. After the major policies and tasks for 1990 economic work have been determined and the planning targets and goals have been clarified, the key is for leading cadres at all levels to unite in thought, change their style of work, go deep into the grassroots, study new situations in a timely manner, solve new problems, and proactively and targetedly do good ideological and political work to timely resolve and handle various contradictions. On the other hand, it is advocated to live frugally for a few years, and cadres must set an example by sharing the same hardships with the people.

	In 1990, the overall economic situation in Shanghai remains very severe, and there are many contradictions and difficulties in the planning arrangements. However, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government emphasize that in the face of difficulties, we must adhere to a dialectical viewpoint and see that there are also many favorable conditions for Shanghai's economic development in 1990. As long as the whole city unites in thought, faces difficulties, boosts morale, and works together, it is entirely possible to achieve the goals of rectification and adjustment and the planning tasks for 1990.

	According to the deployment of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, leading cadres at all levels in Shanghai have seriously studied and discussed the spirit of the national planning and financial work conference. In terms of guiding ideology, they have firmly established the concept of the overall situation. Everyone deeply realizes that Shanghai is Shanghai of the whole country, and Shanghai's development cannot do without the support of the whole country. The central government has difficulties, and Shanghai should make greater contributions to the country. Shanghai comrades should not have a comparison mentality and should not think they are at a disadvantage. Instead, they should compare who can make greater contributions to the country.

	The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government advocate two slogans: one is "When the country has difficulties, everyone shares the burden," and the other is "Shanghai should contribute to the country, and Shanghai people should contribute to Shanghai." Various departments and industries are determined to subordinate local interests to the overall interests and jointly share the country's difficulties.

	During the study and discussion, many cadres in Shanghai proposed to change "three passivities" into "three proactivities": change passive contraction to proactive contraction, change passive conservation to proactive conservation and development, and change passive rectification and adjustment to proactive combination of rectification and adjustment with reform and opening up.

	Next year is a crucial year for rectification and adjustment and deepening reform, and it is a turning point. To ensure the implementation of various economic tasks in the city, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government propose that in 1990, Shanghai should focus on the eight characters "adjustment, rectification, management, and reform," and take new steps in the direction of "improving agricultural efficiency, adjusting industrial structure, rectifying the circulation sector, strengthening urban management, deepening system reform, and expanding opening up." The goal is to be clear, the resolve is great, the actions are decisive, and the steps are steady, so that Shanghai's economy can achieve stability through rectification and adjustment, efficiency through structural adjustment and strengthened management, and development through deepening reform and expanding opening up.

	It is learned that after this meeting, Comrade Zhu Rongji will lead the way by taking the lead in bringing the office cadres to the countryside for field research and investigation.

    朱镕基在上海计划财政会议上指出
    克服当前困难　迎接九十年代挑战
    新华社上海12月20日电　（记者吴复民、李正华）中共上海市委书记、市长朱镕基在今天结束的上海市计划、财政工作会议上说：要克服当前困难，迎接90年代挑战，真正落实各项治理整顿的措施，根本的问题是加强党的建设，加强思想政治工作，加强党风建设，下功夫提高党员、干部队伍的素质。
    与会同志认为，朱镕基同志提出的这个问题，不属经济计划的范围，但对明年经济工作的成败关系极大。在1990年经济工作的大政方针已经确定、计划任务和目标明确以后，关键是各级领导干部要统一思想，转变作风，深入基层，及时研究新情况，解决新问题，主动地有针对性地做好思想政治工作，及时化解和处理各种矛盾。另一方面，提倡过几年紧日子，干部必须以身作则，同群众同甘苦，作出表率。
    1990年，上海整个经济形势仍然十分严峻，在安排计划中面临许多矛盾和困难。但上海市委、市府强调，在困难面前要坚持辩证观点，看到1990年上海经济发展也有很多有利条件。只要全市上下统一思想，正视困难，振奋精神，和衷共济，实现治理整顿的目标和1990年的计划任务是完全可能的。
    根据上海市委、市府的部署，上海各级领导干部认真学习讨论了全国计划、财政工作会议精神，在指导思想上牢固树立了全局观念。大家深刻认识到，上海是全国的上海，上海的发展离不开全国的支持，中央有困难，上海理应为全国作出更大的贡献。上海的同志不能有攀比情绪，不要自认为吃亏，要比一比谁对国家的贡献大。
    上海市委、市府提倡两个口号：一个叫“国家有困难，大家来分担”，另一个是“上海要为全国作贡献，上海人都要为上海作贡献”。各部门、各行各业决心以局部利益服从全局利益，共同分担国家困难。
    在学习讨论中，上海的许多干部提出要变“三个被动”为“三个主动”：变被动紧缩为主动紧缩，变被动节流为主动开源节流，变被动治理整顿为主动与改革开放相结合。
    明年是治理整顿和深化改革的关键一年和转折关头，为保证全市各项经济工作的落实，市委、市府提出：1990年，上海要着重抓住“调整、整顿、管理、改革”8个字，朝着“农业效益要提高，工业结构要调整，流通领域要整顿，城市管理要强化，体制改革要深化，对外开放要扩大”的方向迈出新的步伐，做到目标准、决心大，动作果断、步子稳妥，使上海经济在治理整顿中求稳定，在调整结构加强管理中求效益，在深化改革、扩大开放中求发展。
    据悉，这次会议之后，朱镕基同志将率先带领机关干部到农村蹲点调查研究。
