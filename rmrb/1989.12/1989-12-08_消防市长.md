In Jiangxi Province's Nanchang City, whenever people discuss the development and changes in fire safety work over the past few years, they naturally think of Mayor Cheng An Dong, who cares for and supports fire safety work. Some even affectionately call him the "Fire Safety Mayor."

Now, in the bustling Zhongshan Road intersection and by the Hundred Flowers Bank in Nanchang City, a 12-story, semi-circular fire command center stands tall. The observation tower behind the building reaches up to the sky, becoming a landmark of the city.

The fire command center was built five years ago. Five years ago, during a meeting discussing Nanchang City's urban construction project investments, after attendees expressed their opinions on building the fire command center and observation tower, the mayor of Nanchang City, who had been in office for less than a year, added, "The municipal fire brigade, which is responsible for the city's fire safety, has not had its own office for decades. How can this reflect the rapid response and emergency deployment characteristics of the fire brigade? How can we establish a complete fire management and command network? If we do not urgently address this issue, it will not only affect the development of our city's fire safety work but also fail to provide a reliable safety guarantee for our city's economic construction. As for the observation tower, for a city like ours where communication is not yet highly developed, its role is indispensable. Especially for sudden fires, the observation tower can detect and report fires 3 to 5 minutes earlier than receiving a phone call, saving these precious minutes. Our firefighters can thus reduce the loss of tens or even hundreds of millions of yuan in national and public wealth."

Thus, the 3.5 million yuan construction fund was finally approved.

Based on past fire lessons, Cheng An Dong directed the establishment of a fire special operations team at the end of last year. Under his supervision, after nearly a year of meticulous preparation, on October 13, 1989, a well-equipped team tasked with handling high-rise buildings, underground projects, petrochemical, flammable and explosive, and toxic fires in Nanchang City, the first special operations fire brigade in the province, was officially established. Nanchang City's fire safety construction has significantly improved, gradually moving towards modernization and scientific management.

As the mayor, Cheng An Dong, no matter how busy he is, always seizes any opportunity to advocate for various counties and districts, especially rural areas, streets, and residential committees, to establish fire prevention responsibility systems and appoint full-time fire prevention personnel to leverage the power of community fire prevention and control. Following his suggestion, the municipal government issued a notice, appointing a full-time or part-time fire prevention officer in every county, district, township, town, and urban street office in the city. This approach was affirmed and promoted by the Jiangxi Provincial Fire Safety Commission, the Provincial Public Security Department, and the Ministry of Public Security.

Not only is Cheng An Dong's presence felt at fire prevention meetings and inspections, but he is also seen on the frontlines of the fire scene.

Once, during a fire on Zhushi Street, Mayor Cheng An Dong and the then municipal party secretary appeared at the scene, directing the firefighting efforts while comforting the affected residents.

On September 15, 1988, a major fire occurred at the Fushan Underground Trading Center in Nanchang City. Around 2 AM, Cheng An Dong was the first to arrive at the scene and quickly established the fire scene command center, taking charge as the overall commander. He braved the danger to enter the third floor of the Youth Palace to observe the situation, mobilizing nearly 500 personnel from 18 units, including armed police, traffic, medical, water supply, and electricity supply, to participate in the firefighting efforts. When people praised his fearless and leading-by-example attitude during the 15-hour firefighting operation, Cheng An Dong smiled and said, "The process of firefighting is also the process of disaster relief. Understanding the situation, organizing and coordinating with the fire brigade to fight fires and rescue, and quickly stabilizing the affected residents, is the duty of the party and the government."

    消防市长
    肖磊
    在江西省南昌市，每当人们谈起这几年消防工作的发展变化时，就会自然地想到关心和支持消防工作的市长程安东，甚至有不少人，亲切地把他称为“消防市长”。
    如今，在南昌市繁华的中山路口，百花洲畔，一幢12层高呈半圆形的消防指挥中心拔地而起，楼后的了望塔直插苍穹，成为全市一景。
    消防指挥中心建于5年前。5年前的一天，在讨论南昌市城市建设项目投资的办公会上，与会者对建设消防指挥中心和消防了望塔发表意见后，到任还不满一年的南昌市市长接着说：“担任全市消防保卫任务的市消防大队，几十年来没有自己的办公场所，这怎么能体现出消防部队快速反应，紧急出动的特点？又怎么建立一个系统完整的消防管理指挥网络呢？不抓紧解决这个问题，不仅会影响我市消防事业的发展，而且也使我市的经济建设没有一个可靠的安全保障。至于了望塔，对于我们这样一个通讯还不十分发达的城市来说，它的作用是不可忽视的。特别是对一些突发性火灾，了望塔发现火情后报警要比接到电话报警早3至5分钟，能赢得这宝贵的几分钟，我们的消防战士就能为国家和人民减少几十甚至几百万元财富的损失。”于是350万元的建设用款终于确定下来了。
    根据以往火灾教训，程安东在去年底就指示建立消防特勤中队。在他的督促下，经过近一年时间的精心筹备，1989年10月13日，一支配备较好，承担南昌市的高层建筑、地下工程、石油化工、易燃易爆、剧毒等可能发生的特种火灾任务，全省第一支特勤消防中队正式成立了。南昌市消防建设大为改观，逐步向科学化、现代化发展。
    作为一市之长，程安东不论多忙，只要有机会，他总要呼吁各县区、特别是乡村、街道、居委会把防火责任制建立起来，配备专职防火员，以发挥群防群治的威力。根据他的提议，市政府发出通知，在全市各县、区、乡、镇和城市街道办事处都配备了一名专职或兼职防火员，这一作法，得到了江西省防火安全委员会、省公安厅和公安部的肯定和推广。
    不仅在防火会场、防火检查现场有程安东的身影，在浓烟烈焰的火场，也同样有他的身影。
    一次，珠市街火灾，市长程安东和当时市委书记一道出现在火场，一边指挥消防部队灭火作战，一边安慰受灾的灾民。
    南昌市福山地下贸易中心于1988年9月15日发生特大火灾，凌晨2时许，程安东率先到达火场，并迅速成立火场总指挥部，担任了火场总指挥。他冒着危险进入地下第三层青年宫里观察火情，调动武警、交通、医护、供水、供电等18个单位近500多名工作人员，参加灭火工作。当人们称赞他在火场坚持十几个小时且临危不惧、身先士卒的好作风时，程安东笑着说：灭火的过程也是救灾的过程，了解灾情，组织配合消防部队灭火救灾，及时使灾民安定下来，是党和政府义不容辞的职责。
