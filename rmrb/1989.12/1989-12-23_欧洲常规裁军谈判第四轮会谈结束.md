The fourth round of negotiations on conventional arms reduction in Europe concluded today in Vienna. Disagreements between the Warsaw Pact and NATO on the issue of tank reductions have begun to surface.

At a press conference held today, Grigoryevsky, head of the Soviet delegation, stated that NATO's stance on including light tanks in the reduction scope is commendable. However, if NATO's definition is followed, the number of tanks that the West can retain would exceed the mutually agreed upper limit of 20,000 each, actually reaching 34,000.

In response to the criticism from the Warsaw Pact, the head of the U.S. delegation, Woolsey, argued that the Warsaw Pact is attempting to include as many Western tank models as possible in the reduction scope while excluding as many Eastern tank models as possible.

    欧洲常规裁军谈判第四轮会谈结束
    新华社维也纳12月21日电　（记者刘钢）维也纳欧洲常规裁军谈判第四轮会谈今天在这里结束，华约和北约在有关裁减坦克的问题上开始暴露出分歧。
    苏联代表团团长格里涅夫斯基在今天举行的记者招待会上表示，北约同意将轻型坦克也纳入裁减范围的立场是值得欢迎的，但如果根据北约的定义，西方能够保留的坦克将超出双方提出的各自拥有2万辆的最高限额，实际达到3.4万辆。
    对于华约集团的这一批判，美国代表团团长伍尔西认为，华约方面企图将尽可能多的西方型号的坦克纳入裁减范围，而将尽可能多的东方型号的坦克排除在裁减之外。
