The United States has the world's highest gross national product and is known as the gold empire. Some of the wealthy tycoons in the country are also known for their extravagant spending.

If you don't believe it, take a look at this: A man named Forbes, a giant in the American publishing industry, flew to the Moroccan resort of Tangier in August to celebrate his 70th birthday. This gentleman hosted a grand banquet, inviting over a thousand dignitaries from home and abroad, and chartered three private planes for transportation, spending 30 million dollars without hesitation. However, it's important to note that the annual living expenses for a family of four in the U.S. is 12,091 dollars. In other words, the cost of this birthday celebration alone is enough to support 260 families of four for a year, truly a world of difference!

However, this wealth cannot hide the shadows behind it. According to reports, out of 240 million Americans, 31.9 million live below the poverty line, 18 million receive food stamps, and 1.5 million children are malnourished. Additionally, there are 1.5 million homeless people in the U.S., and 500,000 children are wandering the streets, crying out, "Where is my home?"

On one side, there are bright lights and music; on the other, there are people who cannot eat enough and have no roof over their heads. Thus, "hunger and cold breed thieves," and the number of those who take risks is increasing. According to a report by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were 1.56 million violent crimes in 1988, 20,675 murders, and 12.36 million thefts, all setting new records. Even in the capital, Washington D.C., there were 369 murders last year, and by the end of October this year, 546 people had been killed, surpassing last year's total. No wonder Washington D.C. is known as the "murder capital."

From this, we see that the United States, as the world's richest country, also holds the record for the highest crime rate. Isn't this a contradiction? In fact, it is not. This is the result of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and the widening gap between the two extremes. It is a social malady and a result of the system, with no effective cure in sight.

    在富有的背后
    士芳
    美国国民生产总值居世界之首，号称金元帝国。一些豪富巨贾挥金如土的气魄也可谓世界之最。
    谓予不信，请看：一位名叫福布斯的美国出版界巨头，今年8月飞到摩洛哥避暑胜地丹吉尔去作70大寿。此翁大摆盛宴，款待上千海内外名流并包3架专机接送，耗资300万美元亦无吝色。但要知道，美国一个4口之家一年的生活费是12091美元，换言之，这位寿星的一场寿庆就够260个4口之家过一年的日子，真是天壤之别呵！
    然而，这种豪富丝毫掩盖不住隐藏在其背后的阴影。据报道，在2.4亿美国人中有3190万人生活在贫困线下，1800万人领取食品补贴券，150万儿童营养不良。此外，全美还有150万人无家可归，50万儿童流浪街头，喊出“何处是我家”的呼声。
    一面灯红酒绿，笙歌燕舞；一面食不果腹，头无片瓦。于是，“饥寒起盗心”，铤而走险者有增无减。据美国联邦调查局发表的报告，1988年发生暴力案件156万起，谋杀案20675起，盗窃案1236万起，均刷新记录。甚至在首都华盛顿去年也有369起谋杀案，而今年至10月底，横遭杀害者已达546人，超过去年总数，难怪，华盛顿被冠以“谋杀之都”的称号。
    由此看，美利坚既乃世界首富，却又以犯罪记录“誉满全球”，岂不矛盾？其实，非也。这是富者越富，贫者越贫，两极分化日趋尖锐的结果，是社会痼疾和制度决定了的，苦无良药可治。
