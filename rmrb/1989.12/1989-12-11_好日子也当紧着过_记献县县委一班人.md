A clean courtyard, an old jeep, low-roofed tile houses, and simple office facilities… If it weren’t for the sign at the entrance that reads “Communist Party of China Xian County Committee,” one would hardly believe that this is the party’s county-level leadership office.

Located in the central plains of Hebei Province, Xian County has a history of a folk song that goes, “Clear skies are white and vast, rainy days are watery, all year round no grain is harvested, and people leave their homes and villages.” Since the founding of New China, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, this barren land has undergone tremendous changes. Last year, the county’s total industrial and agricultural output value reached over 300 million yuan, an increase of over 130% compared to the previous year, and the people’s living standards have risen to a new level.

With life improving, should we still advocate for hard work and clean governance? The county committee’s stance is clear: not only should we advocate for it, but we should also persistently promote it. County Committee Secretary Cui Qingcai, who is 51 this year, has been working in local governments for 15 years after being transferred from a provincial agency. In 1986, after coming to Xian County, the main topic of his first meeting with the standing committee members was hard work and clean governance. He and his wife and children live in two dilapidated tile houses within the agency compound. The interior is very simple: a wooden bed and a few old wooden tables and chairs, a 12-inch black-and-white television. In fact, his and his wife’s income could afford a bit of modernization for the home, but he first thought of the county’s education. He and several other county committee leaders donated 1,400 yuan and organized the entire county to contribute to the cause of revitalizing Xian County’s education. Under the leadership of the county committee, various industries in the county donated a total of over 43 million yuan, built 1,429 new classrooms, and ensured that all primary and secondary schools in the county moved out of dilapidated buildings and into new classrooms.

The county committee’s relevant departments had proposed building a decent county committee office building and purchasing some trendy office supplies. The report had not even been drafted when it was rejected by the county committee leaders. To this day, the county leaders and agency staff still work in the old tile houses built in the 1950s and 1960s. This year, the higher authorities allocated a Santana car quota to the county, but the county committee leaders decided after discussion not to accept it and insisted on using the original few old cars.

During a recent period, some units in the county used public funds for extravagant banquets. To stop this trend, the county committee leaders issued a “military order”: no accepting invitations to dine, no accepting gifts, and willingly accepting public supervision. In July and August of this year, County Committee Secretary Cui Qingcai and County Magistrate Chang Baoxing went to Shuangling Township and Duancun Township, dozens of miles away from the county seat, to inspect work. Seeing their clothes soaked in sweat, the township leaders wanted to buy some drinks and prepare a few dishes to express their gratitude, but this was declined by Secretary Cui and Magistrate Chang. They insisted on eating simple meals with everyone in the township agency cafeteria. The leaders’ actions are a silent command to their subordinates. Now, those who use public funds to dine in restaurants have disappeared from this county.

    好日子也当紧着过
    ——记献县县委一班人
    彭保务
    洁净的院落，破旧的吉普车，低矮的瓦房，简陋的办公设施……
    若不是门口那块“中共河北献县委员会”的牌匾，人们很难相信这里是党的县一级领导机关。
    位于河北省冀中平原的献县，历史上曾流传一首“晴天白茫茫，雨天水汪汪，终年粒不收，背井又离乡”的民谣。新中国成立后，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，这块贫瘠的土地发生了翻天覆地的变化。去年，全县工农业总产值达3亿多元，比上年增长130％多，群众的生活跃上了新台阶。
    日子好过了，还要不要继续提倡艰苦奋斗、为政清廉？县委一班人态度明确：不仅提倡，而且要常抓不懈。今年51岁的县委书记崔庆才，从省直机关调地方任职已15个年头。1986年，他来到献县后，第一次召集常委们开会的中心议题就是艰苦奋斗，廉洁从政。他和老伴孩子四口人挤在机关院内两间破旧的瓦房里，室内摆设非常简单：一张木床和几个旧木桌椅，一台12英寸黑白电视机。其实他和老伴的工资收入并非不能营建一点家庭现代化，但他首先想到的是全县的教育，他和其他几位县委领导一次就捐款1400元，并组织全县开展了为振兴献县教育做贡献活动。在县委领导的带动下，全县各行各业共捐资4300多万元，新建校舍1429间，使全县所有中小学校告别危房，搬进了新教室。
    县委有关部门曾提出盖一幢象样的县委办公楼，添置一些新潮办公用具，报告还没拟定，就被县委领导拒绝了。现在，这个县领导和机关工作人员仍然挤在五六十年代盖成的旧瓦房里办公。今年，上级分配给这个县一辆桑塔纳轿车指标，县委领导经研究决定不要，坚持乘坐原来的几辆旧车。
    前一时期，这个县一些单位用公款大吃大喝。为刹住这股歪风，县委领导立下“军令状”：请吃不到，送礼不收，自觉接受群众监督。今年7、8月间，县委书记崔庆才和县长常宝兴到距县城几十里地以外的双岭乡和段村乡检查工作，乡领导看着他们被汗水浸透的衣衫，打算买点饮料，弄几个菜表示一下心意，被崔书记和常县长谢绝了，他们坚持在乡机关食堂和大家一起吃便饭。领导的行动对下级是个无声的命令，现在，这个县拿着公款出入于酒家饭店的人已销声匿迹。
