I am lying in a hospital bed at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, holding onto my hopes for life as I write this letter to you.

In August of this year, I unfortunately contracted nephritis, which later developed into uremia. I have been bedridden for days, and to save my life, I must undergo a kidney transplant. However, this requires over 100,000 yuan in medical fees. My father is a regular cadre, and my mother is an elementary school teacher. How can their salaries cover such a large sum?

Just as I was waiting for the grim reaper to arrive, the county committee and county government leaders showed great concern for me. The county town and township enterprise bureau and the county committee of the Communist Youth League also issued a call to save a young life. Some primary school students donated their pocket money and breakfast money to their teachers, expressing their deep affection and good wishes. To ensure that I could focus on my treatment in Beijing, many kind-hearted people helped my family by installing a stove, buying coal, repairing the ceiling and windows, and even sending money to me in Beijing. Leaders from the county town and township enterprise bureau and the county federation of trade unions visited me in Beijing. The medical and nursing staff at Peking Union Medical College Hospital are doing everything they can to save my life. Thanks to their dedicated treatment and care, my condition has shown signs of improvement.

I, Chen Tieshi, have deeply felt the warmth of socialism among people.

### 我患尿毒症之后

    我患尿毒症之后
    我躺在北京协和医院的病床上，抱着对人生的希望给你们写信。
    今年8月，我不幸得了肾炎，后来转为尿毒症，整日卧床不起，要保住生命，非得做肾移植手术不可，但需要10多万元医疗费。我爸爸是个一般干部，妈妈是个小学教员，他们那点工资怎么能支付出这笔巨款呢！
    正当我等着死神降临时，我们县委、县政府领导十分关心我，县乡镇企业局、团县委还发出救救一个年轻生命的呼吁。一些小学生把爸爸妈妈给他们的零花钱、早点钱拿出来交给老师，寄托了一片情深和良好祝愿。为了让我在北京安心治病，不少好心人又是给我家安炉子、买块煤，又是给裱糊顶棚、窗户，还有人给我寄钱到北京来；县乡镇企业局、县总工会的领导同志，专程来北京看望我。协和医院的医护人员正在想尽一切办法抢救我的生命。多亏他们的精心治疗和护理，我的病情才有所好转。
    社会主义人与人之间的温暖，我陈铁士已深深地感受到了。
