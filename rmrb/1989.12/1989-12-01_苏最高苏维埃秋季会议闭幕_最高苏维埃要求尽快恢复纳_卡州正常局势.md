The Soviet Supreme Soviet's autumn session, which lasted for over two months, concluded today. The session reviewed 29 items related to the political, economic, and social life of the Soviet Union and decided to submit six draft laws, which had passed the first reading, for public discussion.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet's autumn session began on September 25. The session was originally scheduled to end on November 24, but due to the lack of discussion on several important draft laws, the session had to be extended. Despite this, the session still did not complete the review of the 34 laws and documents as planned. This session aimed to pass a series of basic laws on which Soviet economic reforms were based, but due to the diverse opinions and heated debates among the more than 400 representatives present, only a few laws were passed.

The three most important laws passed during this Supreme Soviet session were the "Principles of the Soviet and Union Republics' Lease Law," the "Law on Economic Independence of the Three Baltic Republics," and the "Amendment and Supplement to the Cooperative Law." The "Principles of the Lease Law" guarantees the rights and status of lessees in legal form and stipulates that all products produced on a lease basis belong to the labor collective. The "Law on Economic Independence of the Three Baltic Republics" was the most debated and controversial law in the session. The document stipulates that within the scope of Soviet law, the land and other natural resources within the territories of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia belong to, are used by, and are managed by these three republics. The "Amendment and Supplement to the Cooperative Law" emphasizes the need to stop the improper income of cooperatives.

The Property Law, Land Law, and Press Law did not receive final approval, but these three draft laws, along with the draft laws on retirement, common principles of local self-government, and vacation, will be submitted for public discussion.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet issued a decision on November 28, calling for the swift restoration of normalcy in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast.

The decision agrees to the measures taken by the Azerbaijani Republic's government to dismantle various barricades within its borders and ensure the smooth flow of transportation. The decision suggests that the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet take legal measures as soon as possible to guarantee the true autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh and the safety of its residents. The decision requires the relevant parties to pass a new law on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh within two months to ensure that the oblast has sufficient power to develop its own economy and culture.

    苏最高苏维埃秋季会议闭幕
    最高苏维埃要求尽快恢复纳—卡州正常局势
    新华社莫斯科11月28日电  （记者俱孟军）为期两个多月的苏联最高苏维埃秋季会议今天闭幕。会议审议了29项有关苏联政治、经济和社会生活的法律和文件，并决定将一读通过的6项法律草案提交全民讨论。
    苏联最高苏维埃秋季会议是9月25日开幕的。会议原定11月24日结束，但由于计划内的几项重要法律草案没有讨论，不得不将会期延长。尽管如此，这次会议仍没有完成审议34项法律和文件的计划。这次会议本想通过一系列苏联经济改革所依据的基本法律，但由于参加会议的400多名代表意见纷纭，争论激烈，结果只有少数几项法律获得通过。
    《苏联及加盟共和国租赁法原则》、《波罗的海三个加盟共和国经济独立法》和《合作社法的修改补充法案》，被认为是这次最高苏维埃会议通过的三项最重要的法律。《租赁法原则》以法律形式保障了租赁者的权利和地位，并规定在租赁基础上生产的所有产品都属于劳动集体。《波罗的海三个加盟共和国经济独立法》是在会上争论最为激烈和意见分歧最多的一个法律。文件规定，在苏联法律范围内，在立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚三个共和国领土上的土地和其他自然资源归这三个共和国拥有、使用和支配。《合作社法的修改补充法案》强调对合作社的不正当收入要加以制止。
    人们关注的所有制法、土地法和新闻法没有获得最后通过，但这三项法律草案以及退休法、地方自治的共同原则和休假法草案将提交全民讨论。
    新华社莫斯科11月28日电  苏联最高苏维埃28日发布一项决定，要求尽快使纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫自治州的形势恢复正常。
    这项决定同意阿塞拜疆共和国政权机构采取坚决措施来拆除境内的各种路障，保障交通运输畅通。决定建议阿塞拜疆最高苏维埃尽快采取法律措施，保障纳—卡州的真正自治和居民的生命与安全。决定要求有关各方在两个月之内通过纳—卡州地位的新法律，以保障该州有充分权力来发展自己的经济和文化。
