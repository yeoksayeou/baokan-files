China's "Jidi" scientific research vessel, after a 5-day stopover in Chile's largest port, Valparaiso, set sail today for Antarctica.

The "Jidi" departed from Qingdao on October 30 and, after a 34-day voyage covering 10,800 nautical miles, arrived at the Chilean port on December 4. Its mission for this global voyage is to transport the personnel for China's 6th Antarctic expedition, along with 1,300 tons of supplies and construction materials, to the Chinese stations at the Great Wall and Zhongshan. It will then return with the overwintering expedition team from the two stations. The Great Wall Station, located on King George Island, and the Zhongshan Station in East Antarctica, are 4,100 nautical miles apart. This time, the "Jidi" will provide services to the two distant research stations, a task that is quite arduous.

During its stay in Valparaiso, the "Jidi" was warmly welcomed by Chilean naval and air force authorities, the Chile-China Friendship Association, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Santiago, and the Chinese Embassy. Captain Wei Wenliang and Political Commissar Zhu Dexiu hosted banquets and receptions for friends from various sectors.

The 6th Antarctic expedition team consists of 140 members, including 40 for the Great Wall Station, 61 for the Zhongshan Station, and 39 crew members. The ages of the team members range from 23 to 58.

To strengthen international cooperation, scientists from Pakistan, Japan, and Colombia will also join the Chinese expedition team at the Chinese research stations for joint research. The 6th scientific expedition team will undertake 8 key research tasks.

The "Jidi" is scheduled to begin its return voyage on February 28 next year, passing through Australia and Singapore, and is expected to arrive back in Qingdao, China, by the end of April.

    中国“极地”号考察船离开智利驶向南极
    新华社圣地亚哥12月9日电　（记者陆在宽、孙国维）我国“极地”号科学考察船在智利第一大港瓦尔帕莱索港停泊休整5天之后，今天驶向南极。
    “极地”号今年10月30日从青岛启航经过34天10800海里的航行后，于12月4日驶抵智利海港。它这次环球航行的光荣使命是把我国第6次南极科考工作人员以及1300吨给养和建站物资送到南极中国的长城站和中山站，然后再运载两站的越冬考察队员返航。位于乔治王岛的长城站和东南极的中山站之间相距4100海里。这次“极地”号要为两个相距遥远的科考站提供服务，任务是相当艰巨的。
    “极地”号在智利瓦尔帕莱索港停泊期间，受到了智利海、空军当局、智中文协、智京中华会馆和中国大使馆的热烈欢迎。船长魏文良、政委朱德修分别设宴或举行招待会同各方面友好人士欢聚。
    第6次南极考察队有140人，其中包括长城站队员40人，中山站队员61人，船员39人。队员中最大年龄58岁，最小的23岁。
    为了加强国际合作，还有5名巴基斯坦、日本和哥伦比亚科学家到中国科考站同中国队员进行联合考察。第6次科学考察队将承担8项重点科考任务。
    预计“极地”号将于明年2月28日开始返航，途经澳大利亚和新加坡于4月底返抵中国青岛。
