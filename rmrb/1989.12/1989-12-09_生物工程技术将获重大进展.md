Biotechnological engineering is expected to make significant breakthroughs.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 7th: (Reporter: Dai Lvbin) German medical experts believe that biotechnological engineering will achieve decisive progress.

Experts from the industrial and research sectors attending the German Pharmaceutical Industry Association's academic conference in Frankfurt today said that in the future, research on new vaccines, especially for malaria, leprosy, and AIDS, as well as the development of second-generation bioactive substances, will make significant progress.

According to estimates by German experts participating in this two-day academic conference of the German Pharmaceutical Industry Association, there are currently about 100 types of medicinal products manufactured using genetic engineering undergoing clinical trials worldwide. These include drugs that promote blood cell growth and the hematopoietic drug EPO, both produced using genetic engineering.

A German pharmaceutical company also plans to use genetic engineering technology to produce drugs for treating kidney diseases.

    生物工程技术将获重大进展
    新华社波恩12月7日电  （记者戴履斌）西德医学专家认为，生物工程技术将取得决定性进展。
    正在法兰克福参加西德医药工业协会学术讨论会的工业和研究部门的专家今天说，今后新疫苗特别是抗疟疾、麻风、艾滋病的新疫苗的研究工作以及第二代生物活性物质的研究工作将取得重大进展。
    据参加这一为期两天的西德医药工业协会学术讨论会的西德专家估计，现在全世界约有100多种用遗传工程制造的医药产品在进行临床试验。其中，包括采用遗传工程制造的促进血细胞生长的药物和造血药物EPO。
    西德一家药厂还计划用遗传工程技术制造治疗肾疾病的药物。
