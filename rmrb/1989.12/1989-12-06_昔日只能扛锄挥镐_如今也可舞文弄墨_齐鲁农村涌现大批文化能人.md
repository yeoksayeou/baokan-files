In the land of Qi and Lu, a group of farmers who were once accustomed to dealing with clods of earth have now become skilled craftsmen in building the cultural hall of the countryside, forming deep bonds with singing, dancing, calligraphy, painting, literature, and bonsai.

Reform and opening up have made the vast majority of Shandong farmers well-fed and clothed, giving them time and energy to enrich their spiritual and cultural lives. The pursuit of knowledge, joy, and beauty has plowed through the frozen soil and barren land in the farmers' minds. They are no longer satisfied with passively accepting and appreciating; instead, they use their hands, which are accustomed to holding hoes and trowels, to pick up musical instruments, paintbrushes, cameras...

In Nanquan Village, Linqu County, 60-year-old Song Shude, whose children have grown up and are living comfortably, participated in an unexpected book and painting training class organized by the town in 1986. She learned to read and paint. In the same year, she enrolled in the Chinese Correspondence University of Calligraphy and Painting, studied for three years, and graduated successfully. She excitedly said, "I want to turn the sweat and tears of the past into the colors and ink of today, to express the new life." In just the second half of last year, she painted more than 220 pieces, and many people came to her doorstep to ask for paintings, with a few even taking her as their teacher.

Song Shude's Linqu County currently has more than 1,000 farmers engaged in calligraphy and painting creation, with nearly 20,000 works produced each year. The county also has more than 5,000 core members active in other cultural fields.

These rural cultural talents, being deeply rooted in life, naturally create works that are close to life and are popular among farmers. Some of their works even have a fairly high artistic level. Zhang Lihua, a 35-year-old farmer from Pangjiazhuang, Shengjing Township, Laiwu City, has created three scripts that won first-class awards at the provincial level in the past year. Qin Gengzhao, a lyricist from Weicheng District, Weifang City, defeated his rivals and won the top award at the national music creation "Yuan Fei" competition.

These cultural talents provide beneficial spiritual food for farmers, which to some extent makes up for the neglect and indifference of some professional cultural workers towards rural areas and farmers.

### 昔日只能扛锄挥镐  如今也可舞文弄墨  齐鲁农村涌现大批文化能人

    昔日只能扛锄挥镐  如今也可舞文弄墨
    齐鲁农村涌现大批文化能人
    据新华社济南电　（记者王进业）在齐鲁大地，一批昔日只惯于同土坷垃打交道的农民，而今卓然成为建造农村文化殿堂的能工巧匠，与歌舞、字画、文学、盆景等结下不解之缘。
    改革开放使绝大多数山东农民衣食富足起来，使他们有时间、精力充实精神文化生活。求知、求乐、求美的热潮犁开了农民大脑中的冻土和荒地。他们甚至不再满足于被动地接受、欣赏，而是用握惯了锄头、瓦刀的手，拿起了乐器、画笔、照相机……
    临朐县南关村60高龄的宋淑德，儿女成家，生活无虞。1986年，只上过2年学的她，出人意外地参加了镇里举办的书画培训班，一边认字，一边学画。同年，她又报考了中国书画函授大学，修学3年，顺利毕业。她兴奋地说：“我要把过去的汗水和泪水变成现在的画色和墨水，表现新生活。”仅去年大半年，她就画了220多幅，不少人登门求画，有几个人还拜她为师。
    宋淑德所在临朐县目前有1000多农民从事书画创作，每年作品近2万件。这个县还有5000多名骨干活跃在其他文化领域。
    这些农村文化能人因身处生活深层，其创作自然贴近生活，为农民所喜闻乐见，有一些还具有相当高的艺术水平。莱芜市圣井乡庞家庄35岁的农民张丽华，去年以来创造的剧本有三个获省级一等奖。潍坊市潍城区农民词曲作者秦更钊力挫群雄，捧走了全国音乐创作“鸢飞”奖大赛最佳奖。
    这些文化能人为农民提供了有益的精神食粮，这在一定程度上弥补了一些专业文化工作者对农村和农民的疏远和淡漠。
