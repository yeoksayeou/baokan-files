The first defense science and technology development strategy research report for the year 2000 in China has been published.

This research achievement was commended by the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense today. Liu Huaqing, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended the commendation conference.

Liu Huaqing emphasized at the conference that comprehensive strategic research work must be done well, and advanced technologies worldwide must be tracked to promote the development of China's defense science and technology and weaponry.

Liu Huaqing praised the achievements of the 2000 defense science and technology development strategy research work.

He said, this work has summarized the past, studied the future development goals and key points of defense science and technology, and has significant practical importance for the modernization of national defense. We must strengthen the pre-research work and gradually narrow the gap between China and advanced countries.

Liu Huaqing said, the Party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about the construction of the army. Currently, during the period of rectification and reform, the state's finances have some difficulties, and the task of developing defense science and technology is very arduous. We must be prepared for this mentally.

We must base ourselves on the existing technology and equipment, do a good job in demonstration and analysis research, accelerate the adjustment of defense science research and production capacity, arrange wisely, and make limited funds play a greater role.

Liu Huaqing emphasized the need to firmly follow the path of independent and self-reliant development of defense science and technology industry, stand on our own feet, and strive to absorb advanced foreign technologies.

He said, various departments must establish a global perspective, strengthen the centralized and unified management of weaponry and equipment research and production. We must shorten the front, highlight the key points, concentrate financial and material resources to fight a decisive battle, and make the defense science and technology industry develop in a sustained, stable, and coordinated manner.
