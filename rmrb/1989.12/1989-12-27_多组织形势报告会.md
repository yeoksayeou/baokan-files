Edition: 6

In recent years, to help rural cadres and the masses understand the situation and do a good job, relevant leading cadres reviewed materials and, in combination with the actual situation in their own regions and units, regularly gave situation reports. This played a positive role in unifying people's thoughts and boosting everyone's morale. In recent years, political and ideological work has weakened, and situation report meetings have gradually disappeared. Recently, when I mentioned some major domestic and international events to some township and village cadres, they responded with confusion, and even had no idea what I was talking about. This shows that conducting situation education is very necessary. I suggest that all levels of rural leadership pay attention to situation report meetings. This is a requirement of the situation, and it is also a requirement for strengthening political and ideological work.

    多组织形势报告会
    前些年，为了使农村干部、群众认清形势，搞好工作，有关领导干部翻阅材料，结合本地区、本单位的实际情况，定期作形势报告。这对统一人们的思想，鼓舞大家的干劲起到了积极作用。近年来，政治思想工作削弱了，形势报告会逐渐消失了。最近我向一些乡村干部提起国内外发生的大事，他们反映茫然，甚至一问三不知。这说明搞好形势教育是十分必要的。建议各级农村领导抓好形势报告会。这是形势的需要，也是加强政治思想工作的需要。
