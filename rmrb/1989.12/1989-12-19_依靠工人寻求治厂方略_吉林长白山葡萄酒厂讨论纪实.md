In July of this year, after Xu Juping, the director of the Changbai Mountain Wine Factory in Jilin, accepted the decision by the Jilin Light Industry Bureau to continue his contract to manage the enterprise, he found himself deeply mired in difficulties: the factory's inventory of grape juice had already occupied 25 million yuan in funds, and there was no money to purchase other raw materials, making production difficult to continue; the market had changed, and product sales had plummeted, making it even difficult to pay workers' salaries...

Just as Director Xu was besieged by a host of problems, he received a letter signed by "a worker who cares about the factory's rise and fall." The letter said: "Respected Director, hearing that you have been reappointed, I sincerely hope that you will use your talents to make the wine factory prosperous and flourishing." Like a gentle breeze blowing through his heart, Director Xu was invigorated. He eagerly read on: "As a member of the Communist Party of China, I not only need to complete my duties but also should care about the fate of the Party, the country, and the enterprise. Therefore, I am reflecting my limited insights to you." This letter provided a profound analysis of the factory's quality accidents, production value completion, cadre appointments, and optimization of labor combinations over the past year, and offered constructive suggestions.

Director Xu's hand trembled as he held the letter. Having such a party member who cares about the enterprise gave him strength and confidence: "Good, let's go to the masses to find solutions and seek new strategies for managing the factory."

The next morning, two letters were posted at the factory gate: one was the letter from the anonymous worker, and the other was Director Xu's reply. Director Xu wrote: "At this critical moment of national rectification and adjustment, how to persist in deepening enterprise reforms, overcome temporary difficulties, and forge a path to revitalize the wine factory is the wish of all the workers in the factory, my wish, and the unshakable responsibility entrusted to us by the Party and the people!... We should, like the workers of Jilin Chemical Industry, have the enterprise managed by the workers. Everyone is the master, and I am the leader. I believe that as long as we mobilize the wisdom of the broad masses of workers, gather ideas, and work together, we can overcome difficulties and revitalize the wine factory."

These two letters ignited the hearts of the workers, arousing their sense of ownership. To break through the difficulties and revitalize the factory, everyone was thinking and discussing. A grand discussion soon unfolded across the entire factory, with workers eagerly offering suggestions and strategies.

During the discussion, the workers were shocked to learn that the enterprise was in such dire straits. "We can no longer live in poverty as if we were rich!" Everyone proposed suggestions for saving and tapping potential.

In the past, purchasing grapes involved backdoor deals, making quality difficult to guarantee. In the future, we must resolutely eliminate backdoor deals and ensure quality, saving 60 tons of sugar per year, worth 200,000 yuan.

"Some people have been delaying the repayment of public funds for a long time, especially those whose families are not in dire straits, should repay immediately." Workers voiced their criticism. Within a month, the entire factory repaid 100,000 yuan in public funds.

The factory sends two shuttle buses daily to pick up and drop off workers. Everyone suggested, "Let's squeeze a bit, and run one less bus each day, saving 2,000 yuan per month."

Some workers also suggested that the old cotton curtains could still be used, and there was no need to replace them this winter, saving every bit we can.

The workers presented one effective suggestion after another, offering their hearts to the enterprise. "Set aside complaints, make more contributions, share the enterprise's burdens, and revitalize the wine factory." Over 1,000 workers, with an owner's attitude, embodied this slogan in their actions.

In the summer, floods damaged the factory's pipelines. Originally, the factory planned to outsource the repair work, which would cost 100,000 yuan. Now, various workshops, teams, and departments are volunteering: "We'll do this job ourselves and save this money!" The director led the way, and department heads and workshop workers actively participated in this voluntary labor, reconstructing nearly 100 meters of the river channel, with the project quality even better than originally planned.

In the past, when the wine factory was doing well, the tartaric acid produced during the storage of grape juice was sold as a byproduct to chemical factories after being refined into tartaric acid. Now, workers suggest processing it into sodium tartrate, which can be sold for 200,000 yuan per ton. After more than a month of effort, sodium tartrate was born. The reporter, during an interview, happened to encounter an outside unit placing an order for 100 tons.

In the past, grape seeds in the wine factory could only be used for fuel. In this discussion, workers suggested processing them into grape seed oil, which would yield a considerable income each year. Currently, this grape seed oil, which has the ideal therapeutic effect of lowering cholesterol and softening blood vessels and contains various vitamins, has been put into production. By the end of November, the income was 40,000 yuan.

The workers' sense of ownership has been ignited, and various tasks are now operating vigorously. Facing this scene, Director Xu was so moved that he almost shed tears: "The factory encountered such great difficulties, and everyone did not complain but actively shared the factory's burdens. What good workers!"

However, no one forgot the worker who initiated this discussion, "the worker who cares about the factory's rise and fall." After more than three months of searching, he was finally found. He was Xin Weisheng, a worker in the fruit wine workshop and a member of the Communist Party.

    依靠工人寻求治厂方略
    ——吉林长白山葡萄酒厂讨论纪实
    张兴文　李安达
    今年7月，吉林长白山葡萄酒厂厂长徐菊潘刚刚接受了吉林市一轻局让他继续承包这个企业的决定，就深深陷入困顿之中：厂子库存的葡萄汁已占用资金2500万元，其它原材料又无钱购买，生产难以为继；市场发生变化，产品销量锐减，给职工发工资甚至也困难……
    正当徐厂长被一大堆难题困扰难解之际，收到了一封署名为“一个关心工厂兴衰的工人”的来信。信中说：“尊敬的厂长，得知您连任，由衷地盼望您用自己的才智，将酒厂办得兴旺发达起来。”如一缕清风吹进心田，徐厂长为之一振。他急切地往下读：“我做为一名中国共产党党员，不仅要完成本职工作，理应关心党、国家和企业命运。所以，将自己管中窥豹的一点看法，反映给您。”这封信，对厂内今年以来的质量事故、完成产值情况、干部聘任、优化劳动组合等方面的问题进行了深刻的分析，提出了中肯的建议。
    徐厂长拿信的手颤抖着。有这样关心企业的好党员，给他增添了力量和信心：“好，到群众中去找办法，寻求新的治厂方略。”
    第二天一早，工厂大门口抄贴出两封信，一封是那位暂不知名的工人的来信，一封是徐厂长的回信。徐厂长写道：“当前，在国家治理整顿的关键时刻，如何坚持搞好企业的深化改革，渡过暂时困难，闯出一条振兴酒厂的路子，这是全厂职工的心愿，也是我的心愿，更是党和人民交给我们的义不容辞的责任！……我们应该像吉化工人那样，企业由职工来办来管。大家是主人，我是领头人。我相信，只要发挥广大职工的智慧，集思广益，就能够团结一致，克服困难，振兴酒厂。”
    这两封信如一团火，燃烧着职工们的心，唤起了职工的主人翁责任感。为闯过难关，振兴酒厂，大家思考着，议论着。一场大讨论很快在全厂展开了，职工们争相献计献策。
    讨论中，职工们震惊了，企业竟然困难到这样的地步。“再不能把穷日子当富日子过了！”大家纷纷提出节约挖潜建议。
    过去收购葡萄有走后门问题，质量难以保证。以后要坚决杜绝后门，保证质量，一年就可节约砂糖60吨，价值20万元。
    “有的人长期拖欠公款不还，尤其是家中并不困难的，应立即还款。”职工提出了批评。一个月之内，全厂归还公款10万元。
    厂里每天发两辆通勤车接送职工上下班。大伙提出，“挤一挤，每天少开一辆，每月能节省2000元。”
    还有的职工提出，旧棉门帘还能用，今冬不用换新的了，节省一点是一点。
    职工们用一条条有效的建议，向企业捧出了一颗颗火热的心。“丢开抱怨，多做贡献，为企业分忧，振兴酒厂”，1000多名职工以主人翁的姿态，将这一口号体现在行动中。
    夏天，洪水冲坏了工厂的管道。厂里原打算把修复水管的工程包出去，需要10万元。现在，各车间、班组、科室纷纷请战：“这活我们自己干，省下这笔费用吧！”厂长带头，科室干部、车间工人都积极参加这项义务劳动，重新改河道近百米，工程质量比原来设想的还要好。
    过去酒厂日子好过，葡萄汁在储存过程中产生的酒石，提炼成酒石酸后就当作边角余料卖给了化工厂。现在职工提议把它加工成酒石酸钠，每吨可卖2万元。经过一个多月的努力，酒石酸钠诞生了。记者在采访时，正碰上一个外单位来订货100吨。
    葡萄籽在酒厂过去只能用来烧火。在这次讨论中，职工们建议把它加工成葡萄籽油，每年将有一笔可观的收入。目前，这种具有降低胆固醇、软化血管的理想疗效，并含多种维生素的葡萄籽油已投产。到11月末，收入4万元。
    职工的主人翁精神激发起来了，各项工作开始生机勃勃地运行着。面对这种情景，徐厂长感动得几乎要流泪了：“工厂遇到这么大的困难，大家没有怨言，主动替厂分忧，多好的工人啊！”
    然而，对于引起这场讨论的那位“关心工厂兴衰的工人”，大家并未忘记。经过3个多月的查找，终于找到了。他就是果酒车间工人、共产党员信维生。
