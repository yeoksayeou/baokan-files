The Shantou branch of the China Construction Bank has actively assisted and collaborated with various levels of party, government, and overseas Chinese affairs departments to manage and utilize funds donated by overseas Chinese for local public welfare projects, ensuring that the affection of the sons and daughters of the homeland warms the roots of their ancestral home. In recent years, the bank has handled 98 donation-funded construction projects, with an investment of over 240 million yuan and 3.1 million Hong Kong dollars. The donated funds have all been put to good use, and the managed projects have all been completed and put into operation on schedule, earning the praise of the overseas Chinese.

In managing the construction funds donated by overseas Chinese, the Shantou branch of the China Construction Bank first designated the donation-funded construction projects as key areas, implementing specialized account management to ensure that funds are used for their designated purposes. They also assigned experienced staff to specifically manage these accounts. Secondly, they assisted in implementing bidding and contracting systems for the donation-funded construction projects, as well as other contracting forms, to save funds and ensure that the projects are of high quality and completed on schedule. Lastly, they promptly disbursed loans to address the funding needs of the construction projects and to bridge the gap between the donation and the construction timeline, ensuring a steady supply of funds and enabling the projects to proceed as planned.
