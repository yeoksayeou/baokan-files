The delegates attending the 20th National Federation of Students' Seventh Plenary Session in Beijing today invited veterans who participated in the student movement to discuss the 54th anniversary of the December 9th Movement.

Duan Junyi, Yuan Baohua, and Liu Daosheng spoke at the meeting. They shared their experiences from participating in the December 9th Movement and their decades of revolutionary work, hoping that today's youth will carry forward the glorious traditions of the December 9th Movement in the new historical period. They emphasized the importance of deepening practical work, following the path of uniting with workers and peasants, establishing a correct political direction, adhering to the principle of one central task and two basic points, and seriously studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to become reliable successors of the socialist cause.

Several student representatives also spoke at the meeting. Hu Jingjun from Fudan University said that a deep understanding of patriotism must be based on a thorough understanding of the national situation. University students should go to the grassroots, understand the hardships of the people, and their spirit of hard work and struggle, in order to truly love the motherland. Tang Yong from Nanjing University said that China needs stability, and China's stability is important for world stability. China should not take the path of private ownership.

    据新华社北京12月8日电  （记者胡晓梦）正在北京举行全国学联第二十届主席团第七次会议的全体代表，今天邀请当年投身学生运动老前辈座谈，纪念“一二·九”运动54周年。
    段君毅、袁宝华、刘导生在会上讲了话。他们结合自己当年参加“一二·九”运动的经历和参加革命几十年的经验，希望当代青年在新的历史时期发扬“一二·九”运动的光荣传统，深入实际，走和工农相结合的道路，确立正确的政治方向，坚持一个中心两个基本点，认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，做社会主义事业的坚强接班人。
    一些学生代表在会上发言。复旦大学胡劲军说，对爱国主义的深刻理解必须建立在了解国情的基础上，大学生应该深入基层，了解群众的疾苦和他们艰苦奋斗的精神，才能踏踏实实地热爱祖国。南京大学唐勇说，中国要稳定，中国稳定对世界稳定具有重要作用。中国不能走私有制道路。
