Due to various reasons, 5,000 species of animals will face extinction in the near future.

This warning was issued by scientists at the "International Conference on Biological Issues" held recently in Madrid, the capital of Spain.

Experts at the conference pointed out that due to the decreasing number of humid regions, atmospheric pollution, and the unregulated use of resources in production and research, the rate of extinction of animals and plants on Earth is accelerating. In the first half of this century, one species of mammal became extinct every five years, but in the second half of this century, one species of mammal becomes extinct every two years. In addition, there are currently 20,000 species of plants on Earth that are threatened with extinction.

Scientists call on all countries to take immediate action to protect ecological balance and maintain the human living environment.

    会专家指出，由于湿润的地区越来越少、大气污染以及在生产和科研中对资源的无节制利用，地球上动植物种类消亡速度不断加快。本世纪上半叶，每5年有一种哺乳动物灭绝，但到了本世纪下半叶，每2年就有一种哺乳动物灭绝。此外，目前地球上受绝种威胁的植物有2万种。
