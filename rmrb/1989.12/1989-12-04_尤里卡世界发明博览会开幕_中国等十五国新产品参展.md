The 38th Eureka World Invention Expo opened today at the Rogier International Exhibition Center in Brussels.

Fifteen countries, including China, Belgium, West Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, are participating in this expo. Approximately 500 new inventions are on display, with a total of 97 exhibition booths. China is exhibiting 143 projects, of which 48 are competing for awards at the conference.

The primary goal of the Brussels Expo is to encourage inventors who contribute to improving people's living standards and quality of life. The Chinese delegation has summarized the experience from their previous three participations, leveraging their strengths in medicine, health, chemical engineering, and other fields to provide practical inventions to the European people. They have shifted their focus from primarily winning awards to exploring technological trade, aiming to develop cooperation in technology with foreign countries and promote their products. This time, exhibitors from Beijing, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jilin, Shaanxi, as well as the Chemical Industry Ministry and the Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, have all strengthened their advertising and publicity efforts, paying more attention to catering to the interests of foreign consumers. The expo will conclude on December 10.

    本报布鲁塞尔12月2日电　记者魏崴报道：第38届布鲁塞尔尤里卡世界发明博览会今天在布鲁塞尔罗杰国际展览中心开幕。

    布鲁塞尔博览会主要宗旨是鼓励为提高人民生活水平、改善生活质量作出贡献的发明者。中国展团总结以往三次参展的经验，发挥自己的优势，在医疗、保健、化工等方面，向欧洲人民提供些实用发明，从过去以得奖为主要目的开始转向开拓技术贸易，着眼发展与外国技术合作领域，推销产品。此次参展的北京市、山东、浙江、吉林、陕西以及化工部、船舶工业总公司诸单位，均加强了广告宣传，更加注意迎合外国销费者的兴趣。博览会将于本月10日结束。
