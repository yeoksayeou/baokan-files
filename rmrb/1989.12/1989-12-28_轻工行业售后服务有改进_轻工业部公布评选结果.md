Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 28th.

The Ministry of Light Industry announced the results of the national light industry after-sales service evaluation on December 27. A total of 24 enterprises were named as outstanding after-sales service enterprises, and 47 enterprises were commended for their after-sales service.

Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Light Industry decided to carry out this activity in six industries: refrigerators, washing machines, electric fans, bicycles, clocks, and pianos. This initiative has driven these light industry enterprises to strengthen their after-sales service work. After more than 10 months of effort, the after-sales service work in these six light industry sectors has shown significant improvements. By the end of November, the number of complaint letters received by the Quality Supervision and Management Committee of the Ministry of Light Industry had decreased by 60% compared to the previous year, while the number of commendation letters had increased by 25 times. In this evaluation, 21 enterprises were criticized for poor after-sales service. These enterprises mainly produce "Rizhi" brand refrigerators, and include non-designated factories, as well as companies and factories that register and assemble the "Rizhi" trademark.
