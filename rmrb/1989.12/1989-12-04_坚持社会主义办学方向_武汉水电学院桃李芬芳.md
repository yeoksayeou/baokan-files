	“Unity, rigor, diligence, and progress.” This phrase, written by Li Peng to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering, succinctly summarizes the school's achievements over the years in adhering to the socialist educational direction.

	Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering was established on December 1, 1954, with the approval of the State Council. It has since grown from an initial single-discipline engineering school focused on water resources to a comprehensive key university with a primary focus on water and electric power, as well as disciplines in literature, science, education, and more. The school currently has 14 departments and 37 majors, making it the largest university in China specializing in water and electric power.

	Over the past 35 years, the school has consistently adhered to the correct educational direction, aiming to cultivate high-level technical professionals in water and electric power who are well-rounded in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, with a solid theoretical foundation, active academic thinking, creativity, and a spirit of dedication. The school has been honored as a “Model of Teaching Quality” by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and an “Advanced Unit in Ideological and Political Work” by the Hubei Provincial Committee. According to the school's tracking survey of graduates from the Class of 1977 onwards, over 85% have received high evaluations from their employers.

	The school has diligently implemented the policy of serving socialist economic construction, following a path that integrates teaching, scientific research, and practical production. Over the past 35 years, the school has trained over 20,000 college graduates, more than 1,000 graduate students, and over 20,000 technical cadres for the country. The vast majority of them have become technical backbones and business leaders in their respective units, making significant contributions to the development of China's energy engineering and water and electric power industries.

    坚持社会主义办学方向  武汉水电学院桃李芬芳
    新华社武汉12月2日电  （记者唐卫彬）“团结、严谨、勤奋、进取”。李鹏同志为祝贺武汉水利电力学院建校35周年而写的这句题词，高度概括了这所学院多年来坚持社会主义办学方向而呈现出的喜人景象。
    武汉水利电力学院是1954年12月1日经国务院批准建立的，目前已由建院初期的单一的水利类专业工科院校发展成为以水利电力类专业为主，文、理、教育等学科兼有的综合性重点大学，共有14个系37个专业，是我国规模最大的水利电力类大学。
    35年来，这所学院始终坚持正确的办学方向，把培养理论基础宽厚、学术思想活跃、富有创造力和献身精神的德、智、体全面发展的水利电力高级技术人才作为目标，曾被水电部和湖北省委分别授予“教学质量标兵”和“思想政治工作先进单位”。据学校对77级以来的毕业生跟踪调查，85％以上获得用人单位的较高评价。
    这所学院认真贯彻为社会主义经济建设服务的方针，走教学、科研和生产实践相结合的道路，35年来共为国家培养了2万余名大学生、千余名研究生和2万余名技术干部，他们中的绝大多数已成为各单位的技术骨干和业务带头人，为发展我国的能源工程和水利电力事业作出了重要贡献。
