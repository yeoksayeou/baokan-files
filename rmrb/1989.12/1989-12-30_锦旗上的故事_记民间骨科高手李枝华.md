In the outpatient department of the Chengdu 784 Factory Traditional Chinese Medicine Bone Research Institute, which has been established for only a few years, hundreds of banners donated by patients cover the walls. Each banner tells a moving story, like a song of praise: "Expert medical skills," "Reincarnation of Hua Tuo," "Miraculous healing hands"...

This "reincarnation of Hua Tuo" is Li Zhihua, a folk bone specialist who has gained fame in Chengdu in recent years.

"Only you can save my crippled body"

There is a particularly long and large banner that reads: "Only you can save my crippled body, allowing me to return to work and save others." This is a heartfelt praise from Huang Shourong, an internal medicine doctor at the Yibin 799 Factory Hospital. Huang Shourong discovered in 1980 that his buttocks were increasingly painful, and medication was ineffective. He sought treatment at a large hospital in Chengdu, where he was diagnosed with rheumatoid nerve pain. However, the more he was treated, the worse his condition became. In a few years, he ended up using two crutches and could not even put on his own shoes and socks. In October 1988, he saw a report in the newspaper about Li Zhihua's excellent medical skills and wrote a letter. After reading the letter, Dr. Li diagnosed him with bilateral femoral head avascular necrosis and immediately warmly replied. Huang Shourong, who was in a state of despair, came to Chengdu with his family. Dr. Li, fearing that Huang Shourong would have difficulty taking the bus with his crutches, even sent an ambulance to the train station to pick him up.

Huang Shourong was admitted to the hospital on November 27 of that year. After Dr. Li's careful treatment, the bone marrow vessels gradually regained their vitality. By the end of May this year, he had thrown away his crutches. At that time, he was so happy that he climbed up and down the stairs five times in a row. He excitedly said, "I am a Western doctor and originally did not believe in traditional Chinese medicine. Facts have educated me, and I am convinced!"

A Banner from Across the Taiwan Strait

Among the many banners, one stands out: it is dark blue in color and uses traditional Chinese characters. It reads: "To Dr. Li Zhihua: My mother's fracture was hopeless, but fortunately, a divine being appeared." The signature reads: "Liyu Ying and Lixue Ying from Zhongli City, Taoyuan County, Taiwan." It turns out that Liyu Ying and Lixue Ying's mother, Grandma Cai, was 81 years old and lived alone in Chengdu. Last year, she unfortunately fell and fractured her femoral neck. Grandma Cai's grandson, Wang Kaigui, used a tricycle to take her to the hospital, but several hospitals refused to admit her due to her advanced age. Later, Wang Kaigui took her to the 784 Bone Research Institute. Dr. Li saw that Grandma Cai had no family members to take care of her and decided to let her stay in a home care bed, visiting her every day for treatment.

Grandma Cai's two daughters in Taiwan learned of their mother's condition and were very anxious. They immediately found a way to return to Chengdu, planning to see their mother one last time. Who would have thought that on June 5th, they would see their mother sitting upright and even able to walk? After learning the facts, they were extremely moved. They returned to Taiwan and specially wrote a letter to Li Zhihua, sending him a banner.

An Urgent Call from the Old Mountain Front Line

On the fifth day of the Lunar New Year in 1989, people were still celebrating the Spring Festival. Suddenly, the director of the 784 Factory, Teng Shengcai, received an urgent call from the Old Mountain Front Line: "Please, Director Teng, quickly send Li Zhihua to the Old Mountain Front Line for a consultation..."

The caller was Pu Haicheng, the leader of the Sichuan Provincial Delegation to the Old Mountain Front Line for the Spring Festival and the Vice Governor of Sichuan Province. It turned out that the previous day, during a visit, Jiang Lizheng, the deputy director of the Chengdu Railway Bureau Office, had a car accident that resulted in a comminuted fracture of his right knee. After a consultation at the Old Mountain Front Line hospital, they planned to remove the knee bone. Pu, the team leader, thought, "If the knee bone is removed, won't it cause Jiang to be disabled for life?" In his anxiety, he thought of Li Zhihua. Director Teng found Li Zhihua. In 1986, Dr. Li had gone to the Old Mountain Front Line to treat bone injuries for the soldiers and officers. Without hesitation, he immediately rushed to the Old Mountain Front Line.

When everyone heard Dr. Li say that Jiang's leg could be saved, they all breathed a sigh of relief.

Although Li Zhihua is a highly skilled doctor, he remains humble. He said that their bone research institute has a cure rate of just over 90% for patients, which shows that he is not a "god-like" doctor who can cure all diseases. He is determined to learn from everyone, strive for excellence, and relieve the pain of more patients.

    锦旗上的故事
    ——记民间骨科高手李枝华
    本报记者　罗茂城
    在建立才几年的成都784厂中医骨科研究所门诊室，数百面患者赠送的锦旗，把四周的墙壁盖得严严实实。每面锦旗都内含着一个动听的故事，犹如一首首赞美诗：“医术精湛”、“华佗再世”、“妙手回春”……
    这位再世“华佗”就是近几年享誉成都的民间骨科高手李枝华。
    “救我残身独一家”
    有一面特长特大的锦旗，上面写着：“救我残身独一家，重返岗位救他人”。这是宜宾市799厂职工医院内科医师黄守荣对李枝华的由衷赞颂。黄守荣1980年发现自己的屁股越坐越痛，吃药也不管用。他到成都一家大医院求医，诊断为风湿性神经痛。谁知他越治病情越重，不几年便拄上了双拐，连鞋袜也不能自穿。1988年10月，他从报上看到李枝华医术高明的报道，便写了一封信。李医生看信后确诊为双股骨头缺血性坏死，立即热情地给他回了信。处于绝望状态的黄守荣在亲人陪同下赶来成都。李医生怕黄守荣拄双拐挤公共汽车不便，还派救护车到火车站接他。
    黄守荣从去年11月27日住院，经过李医生的细心治疗，骨液血管慢慢恢复了生机，到今年5月底，便甩掉了拐棍。当时他高兴得从楼上楼下一口气爬了5次。他激动地说：“我是西医，原来不相信中医，事实教育了我，我信服了！”
    来自台湾海峡的锦旗
    众多锦旗中有一面显得与众不同：颜色是藏青色的，字体是繁体字。上面写着：“李枝华医师大鉴：母亲骨折无奈，巧遇神灵显身。”落款是：“台湾中坜市桃源县黎秀英黎学英。”原来，黎秀英、黎学英的母亲蔡婆婆81岁了，孤身一人住在成都市。去年不幸跌了一跤，造成股骨颈骨骨折。蔡婆婆的外孙王开贵用三轮车将她送往医院，没想到几家医院都以年纪太大不易治好而拒收。后来王开贵又把她送到784骨研所。李医生看到蔡婆婆身边无亲人照料，决定让她住家庭病床，每天上门为她治疗。
    蔡婆婆在台湾的两个女儿得知老母病情，十分焦急，立即想法辗转赶回成都，准备为母亲送终。谁知6月5日她们回来，竟看到母亲好端端的坐着，还能下床走动。当她们了解事实经过以后，极为感动。她们回到台湾，特地给李枝华写来一封信并寄来了锦旗。
    老山前线来的加急电话
    1989年农历正月初五，人们还在欢度春节。784厂厂长腾生才突然接到老山前线打来的加急电话：“求求您，腾厂长，快放李枝华到老山前线出诊……”
    打电话的是四川省赴老山前线春节慰问团团长、四川省副省长蒲海清。原来，头一天慰问团成员、成都铁路局办公室副主任江力征在慰问途中因车祸造成右膝盖骨粉碎性骨折移位。老山前线医院会诊后打算取掉膝盖骨。蒲团长想，膝盖骨取掉，岂不造成小江终生残废？他在焦急中想到了李枝华。腾厂长找到李枝华。1986年曾赴老山前线为指战员治疗骨伤的李医生二话没说，立即赶赴老山前线。
    当大家听了李医生说小江的腿能保住时，都松了一口气。
    李枝华尽管医术高明，但却很谦虚。他说，他们骨研所收治的病人治愈率才90％多一点，这说明自己并不是包医百病的“神医”。他决心博取众家之长，精益求精，为更多的患者解除痛苦。
