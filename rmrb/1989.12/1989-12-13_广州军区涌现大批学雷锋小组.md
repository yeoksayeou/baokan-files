A wave of "Learn from Lei Feng in thought, follow Lei Feng's path" has swept through the various units of the Guangzhou Military Region, with thousands of Learn-from-Lei Feng groups becoming active once again in barracks and on the streets.

In the economically developed Pearl River Delta, soldiers clean public places such as docks and stations, help the elderly and carry luggage for travelers. Since mid-November, thousands of soldiers participating in winter camping exercises in this region have, despite their fatigue, eagerly helped local residents carry water, sweep floors, repair bridges, and provide medical care. They have also harvested late-season rice for villagers lacking labor. Statistics show that this camping unit has harvested over 350 mu of late-season rice and dug over 500 mu of tree pits during training intervals. All companies in a certain regiment have established Learn-from-Lei Feng groups, and in the past month, they have done over 1,400 good deeds for the local people.

The Guangzhou Military Region launched a new wave of Learn-from-Lei Feng activities in October. Various units have used wall newspapers, blackboards, slide shows, broadcasts, and speech contests to extensively promote the significance of learning from Lei Feng and his deeds, as well as to publicize advanced examples of Learn-from-Lei Feng activities within their units. A certain regiment organized a "Learn-from-Lei Feng Propaganda and Mobilization Month," with each brigade holding exhibitions on "Lei Feng's Deeds" and conducting thematic discussions on learning from Lei Feng. This ensured that everyone knew Lei Feng's deeds, making the Learn-from-Lei Feng activities both lively and practical.

    广州军区涌现大批学雷锋小组
    新华社广州12月12日电  （记者郑国联）广州军区各部队掀起“学雷锋思想，走雷锋道路”的热潮，数以千计的学雷锋小组重新活跃在营区、街头。
    在经济发达的珠江三角洲，战士们在码头、车站等公共场所打扫卫生，扶老携幼，为旅客搬运行李。11月中旬以来，数千名在这一地区进行冬季野营拉练的官兵，每到一地都不顾疲劳地争着为老乡挑水扫地，修桥补路，送医送药，为缺少劳力的群众收割晚稻。据统计，这支野营部队利用训练间隙已为群众收割晚稻350多亩，挖绿化树坑500多亩。某师所有连队全部健全了学雷锋小组，近一个月时间为群众做好事1400多件。
    广州军区是在10月份掀起新的学雷锋热潮的。各部队利用墙报、黑板报、幻灯、广播、演讲比赛等多种形式，大张旗鼓地宣传学雷锋的意义和雷锋的事迹，大力宣扬本单位学雷锋的先进典型人物。某师专门组织了“学雷锋宣传发动月”，各团分别举办了“雷锋事迹”展览，开展学雷锋专题讨论，做到雷锋事迹人人知晓，使学雷锋活动既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
