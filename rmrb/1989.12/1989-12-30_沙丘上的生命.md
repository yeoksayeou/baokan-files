Title: Life on the Sand Dunes

Just as there are paths where people walk and waters where people swim, there are sand dunes in the desert.

Sand dunes come in various sizes and shapes. Some are as large as small hills, while others are like small mounds. Some resemble round steamed buns; others look like towering walls. From a distance, they undulate and roll like the waves of the sea, creating a magnificent sight.

An "old desert hand" told me that sand dunes are the lifeblood of the desert. When you are thirsty, the sand dunes provide you with fresh water; when the sun is scorching, the sand dunes offer you shade; when the sandstorms come, the sand dunes shield you...

Sand dunes are not eternal, just as paths are created by people walking. This place was once a vast expanse of yellow sand, where the wind and sand reigned supreme. But one day, a few golden raindrops carried seeds of poplar, tamarisk, and unknown grasses, all of which were scattered onto the sand. Some of these seeds sprouted, growing into patches of grass, a few tamarisk trees, and a few poplar trees. However, as soon as they emerged, the wind and sand mercilessly buried them. They struggled to resurface. The sand buried them again, and they fought back, over and over, until they were utterly exhausted...

Each sand dune is a testament to the countless battles fought against the wind and sand. Inside a sand dune, you'll find a tangled web of roots. Each root is a defiance against the forces of nature; each sand dune records their glorious deeds; each spot tells a tragic story...

I couldn't help but think back to the days when we were building the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Many of our comrades rest here in the vast desert, their bodies forming one sand dune after another. That afternoon, we were working intensely when suddenly, a sandstorm struck. The sand grains beneath our feet spun rapidly, and a wide, long sand wave rushed towards us at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour, with scorching air and whirling sand enveloping us, blinding our eyes.

"Quick," the platoon leader shouted, "Everyone, hold hands and protect the equipment and tools!" Before he finished speaking, the sand wave roared and engulfed us, burying our legs up to our knees. I reached out and grabbed my comrade's hand, struggling to free my legs. The storm tore us apart, knocking us down, but we held on, not daring to stop for a moment. Otherwise, we would be buried alive. Exhausted beyond measure, our hearts pounding, we dared not open our mouths, for the sand would choke us. Finally, when the storm subsided, the platoon leader and the cook were buried under the sand while trying to lift a sack of rice. By the time we frantically dug them out, they had stopped breathing.

At the Guanjiao Mountain Tunnel, when a major cave-in occurred, Deputy Squad Leader Xiong Yougen pushed away his comrades and rushed back to pull out the drill rods. At that moment, a huge boulder fell—

We built sand dune graves for them, erected wooden markers, and inscribed: "Grave of the railway soldier ××× who sacrificed his life for the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway."

Ten years have passed. Today, I once again tread the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, coming to the place where my comrades sacrificed themselves. I can no longer recognize the graves of my former comrades. All I see are sand dunes, big and small, near and far, each unique yet similar, like a herd of galloping horses, like surging waves, full of vigor. I took out the wine I brought with me and poured it into the air, towards the endless sand dunes—at the end of the sand line, the sun lay like a ball of blood.

Ah, the desert's dreams are here, the desert's aspirations are here, and the desert's future is here.

The desert's sand dunes live with life.

The desert's sand dunes are our tombstones as road builders!

    沙丘上的生命
    姬妮
    正像有路就有人走，有水就有人游一样，有沙漠就有沙丘。
    沙丘有大有小，有短有长，大的像小山，小的像土岗。有的像圆圆的馒头；有的像高耸的城墙；远远望去，起伏跌宕，又像是大海的波涛涌来荡去，甚为壮观。
    一个“老沙漠”告诉我，沙丘是大漠的生命。干渴时，沙丘给你清泉；日晒时，沙丘会给你荫凉；风沙来时，沙丘又替你阻挡……
    沙丘并不是自古就有的，就像路是靠人走出来的一样。这里原也是黄沙茫茫，风强盗、沙魔王恣意肆虐、横行无忌。可忽然有一天，风里头夹来几滴金雨，雨中夹着裹来的胡杨种子、红柳穗子，不知名的草籽，一齐播到了沙地里。过了些时候，有的就发芽了，长出了一片小草、几棵红柳、几株胡杨。然而等它们刚一露头，风沙就无情地把它们埋住，它们顽强地又冒出头来。黄沙再来埋，它们就再冒头，直到精疲力竭……一次、一次，如此反复，一个个沙丘就这样形成了。沙丘愈大，说明与风沙搏斗的次数越多。打开一个沙丘，里面真是盘根错节。每一条根都是对自然界恶势力的示威；每一个沙丘都记录着它们的光荣业绩；每一处都是一部悲壮的故事……
    我不由想起在我们修建青藏铁路的日子里，不少的战友就长眠在这大漠里，用自己的身躯筑起了一个个的大沙包。那天下午，我们正在紧张的施工，忽然间，风暴骤起，脚下的沙粒急速打转，一道又宽又长的排浪似的沙梁以每小时60公里的高速呼啸而来，烫人的气浪和旋转的雾在我们周围疾速弥漫、升腾，打得人睁不开眼。
    “快，”连长大声喊：“大家手挽手拉在一起，保护好器材、工具！”话音刚落，沙浪就咆哮着扑了上来，一排烫人的黄沙立即淹没了我们的小腿。我伸出手拉住战友的手，拚命拔出腿来。风暴又无情地把我们扯开，推倒，我们又拉在一起，片刻不敢停留。不然，就会被沙浪活埋。累极了，累得心都要炸开了，却不敢大口喘气，因为一张嘴就会被风沙噎死。好不容易等风暴过后，连长和炊事班长却为抬一袋大米被沙埋住了，等我们发疯般把他们扒了出来，他们的呼吸已经停止了。
    在关角山隧道，当大塌方发生时，副排长熊友根一把推开了身边的战友，又返身去拔钻杆，这时，巨石塌了下来——
    我们为他们筑了沙丘坟茔，立下了木牌，写着：为修筑青藏铁路而献身的铁道兵战士×××之墓。
    十年过去了。今天，我又重踏青藏铁路，来到当年战友们献身的地方，已辨认不出昔日战友的坟墓了。只见一个个沙丘，大大小小、远远近近，各不尽相同，却又大致相似，如万马奔腾，大浪激涌，气势蓬勃。我取出随身带的酒，望空洒去，望这绵延的沙丘群洒去——沙线尽头，趴着血球般的太阳。
    呵，大漠的梦幻在这里，大漠的憧憬在这里，大漠的未来也在这里。
    大漠的沙丘，与生命同在。
    大漠的沙丘，我们筑路人的墓碑！
