This system uses three control methods: bidirectional wireless microcomputer remote terminal, wireless remote control metering device, and wireless remote control switch. It is controlled centrally from the control center located in the power supply bureau. After being put into operation, it can reduce the economic losses caused by power outages in Chengdu City by more than 30 million yuan per year, saving 30 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.
