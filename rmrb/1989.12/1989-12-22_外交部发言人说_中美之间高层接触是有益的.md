Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jin Guihua said today at a press conference that President Bush's approval of the export of three communication satellites to be launched by China, and his authorization of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to resume export credits to China, are positive steps that help to restore normalcy in Sino-U.S. bilateral relations.

The spokesperson said, "We welcome this."

In response to a reporter's question, Jin Guihua said that in July of this year, at the request of the U.S. side, China received a visit from U.S. President Bush's special envoy, General Scowcroft. He said that such high-level exchanges between China and the U.S. are beneficial and help to enhance mutual understanding.
