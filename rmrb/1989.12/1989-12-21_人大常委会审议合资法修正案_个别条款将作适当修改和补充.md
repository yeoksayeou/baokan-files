Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th.

The Premier of the State Council, Li Peng, submitted to the 11th session of the 7th National People's Congress Standing Committee, held today, a proposal from the State Council to review the draft amendments to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures.

The proposal states that to further implement the policy of opening up to the outside world, continue to improve the investment environment, and enable foreign investors to invest in China with greater confidence, thereby more effectively learning advanced foreign technologies and management experience, improving enterprise management levels, and promoting better development of the national economy, the State Council believes it is necessary to make appropriate amendments and supplements to certain provisions of the Law on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures.

Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Zheng Tuobin, was commissioned by the State Council to explain the draft amendments to the Law on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures.

Zheng Tuobin said that the Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures has been in effect for ten years. The law has played a significant role in implementing China's policy of opening up to the outside world and utilizing foreign capital. Its basic principles are still applicable today. With the deepening of China's policy of opening up to the outside world and the development of the work of utilizing foreign capital, certain provisions of the law need to be amended.

Zheng Tuobin proposed adding a clause to Article 2 of the law, as the third clause: "The state does not nationalize or expropriate joint venture enterprises. In special circumstances, according to the needs of public interest, joint venture enterprises can be expropriated in accordance with legal procedures, and appropriate compensation shall be given."

He said that the original provision in Article 6, paragraph 1, of the law states, "The board of directors shall have one chairman, who shall be appointed by the Chinese partner." According to this provision, regardless of the amount of investment by the foreign partner, the foreign partner cannot serve as the chairman of the joint venture enterprise. In the past ten years, both Chinese and foreign partners, especially foreign partners, have repeatedly expressed their opinions on this provision, believing that it is not entirely reasonable and requesting amendments. Therefore, the provision is now amended to: "The chairman and vice-chairman shall be determined by the joint venture parties through consultation or elected by the board of directors. If one of the Chinese or foreign partners serves as the chairman, the other party shall serve as the vice-chairman."

Zheng Tuobin said that the original provision in Article 12 of the law states: "The term of the joint venture enterprise may be determined by the joint venture parties according to different industries and different situations." On September 20, 1983, Article 100 of the Implementing Regulations of the Law on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures, issued by the State Council, made specific provisions for the term of the joint venture enterprise, namely: "The term of general projects is generally 10 to 30 years. For projects with large investments, long construction periods, and low capital returns, the term of the joint venture can also be more than 30 years." On January 15, 1986, the State Council amended the above provisions to: "The term of general projects is 10 to 30 years. For projects with large investments, long construction periods, and low capital returns, or projects that provide advanced technology or key technology for the production of cutting-edge products by foreign partners, or projects that have international competitiveness, the term of the joint venture can be extended to 50 years. With special approval from the State Council, it can be more than 50 years." Therefore, the provision in Article 12 of the law is now amended to: "The term of the joint venture enterprise shall be determined by the joint venture parties through consultation according to different industries and different situations. The joint venture parties may determine the term of the joint venture in the contract or may not determine the term of the joint venture."

    人大常委会审议合资法修正案
    个别条款将作适当修改和补充
    新华社北京12月20日电  国务院总理李鹏向今天召开的七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议提交了国务院关于提请审议中华人民共和国中外合资经营企业法修正案草案的议案。
    议案说，为了进一步贯彻对外开放方针，继续改善投资环境，使外国投资者能够更放心地来我国投资，从而更有利于我国学习国外的先进技术和管理经验，有效地提高企业管理水平，促进国民经济更好的发展，国务院认为，有必要对中外合资经营企业法的个别条款进行适当修改和补充。
    对外经济贸易部部长郑拓彬受国务院委托就国务院提请审议的这个修正案草案作了说明。
    郑拓彬说，中华人民共和国中外合资经营企业法已经公布实施十年了。合资法对贯彻我国的对外开放政策和利用外资工作起了巨大的推动作用，它的基本原则至今仍然适用。随着我国对外开放政策的深化和利用外资工作的发展，合资法的某些条款需要进行修改。
    郑拓彬说，建议合资法第二条中增加一款，作为第三款：“国家对合营企业不实行国有化和征收。在特殊情况下，根据社会公共利益的需要，对合营企业可以依照法律程序实行征收，并给予相应的补偿。”
    他说，合资法第六条第一款中原规定，“董事会设董事长一人，由中国合营者担任”。根据这一规定，无论外国合营者投资多少，外国合营者都不能担任合营企业的董事长。在过去10年中，中外合营者，特别是外国合营者纷纷对这条规定提出意见，认为这样规定不尽合理，要求修改。据此，现将这一规定修改为：“董事长和副董事长由合营各方协商确定或由董事会选举产生。中外合营者的一方担任董事长的，由他方担任副董事长”。
    郑拓彬说，合资法第12条原规定：“合营企业合同期限，可按不同行业、不同情况，由合营各方商定”。1983年9月20日国务院发布的合资法实施条例第100条中对合营企业期限作了具体规定，即：“一般项目的合营期限原则上为10年至30年。投资大、建设周期长、资金利润率低的项目，合营期限也可以在30年以上”。1986年1月15日国务院曾将上述规定修改为：“一般项目的合营期限为10年至30年。投资大、建设周期长、资金利润率低的项目，由外国合营者提供先进技术或关键技术生产尖端产品的项目，或在国际上有竞争能力的产品的项目，其合营期限可以延长到50年。经国务院特别批准的可在50年以上”。为此，现将合资法第12条的这一规定修改为：“合营企业的期限，按不同行业、不同情况，由合营各方协商确定。合营各方在合同中可以确定合营期限，也可以不确定合营期限”。
