Panama City returned to calm on the 17th after armed clashes between Panamanian and American forces on the evening of the 16th resulted in the death of one American officer and injuries to three Panamanians.

The Panama Canal, which was closed for a period on the evening of the 16th, resumed normal operations on the 17th. However, the Panamanian Defense Forces and militia organizations remain on the highest alert to prevent further provocations from the United States. The U.S. Southern Command in the Canal Zone also remains on alert and has restricted all American military personnel from going out.

    巴拿马城恢复平静
    巴拿马和美国军人十六日晚发生武装冲突造成一名美国军官死亡、三名巴拿马人受伤的事件后，巴拿马城十七日恢复平静。
    巴拿马运河在十六日晚关闭一段时间后已于十七日恢复正常航运。但是，巴拿马国防军和民兵组织仍处于最高级戒备状态，以防止美国再次挑衅。驻运河区的美国南方司令部也保持戒备，并限制所有美国军人外出。
