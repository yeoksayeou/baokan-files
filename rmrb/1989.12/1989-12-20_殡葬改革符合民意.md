Reporter Bào Hóngjùn of this newspaper interviewed the Ministry of Civil Affairs regarding the issues in funeral services that readers have reflected in recent times.

What is the current state of funerals in China? Li Shūxīān, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, introduced to the reporter that last year, approximately 6 million people died nationwide, setting a record for cremation rates at 30%, while the cremation rate in 1978 was 18%. After 10 years of effort, the cremation rate only increased by 12%. According to calculations, burying one body requires 20 square meters of land, 0.5 cubic meters of wood, and 1,500 yuan, in 1988 alone, 130,000 mu of land was occupied by the dead, 2 million cubic meters of wood was buried, and 7 billion yuan was spent in vain. Such waste is regrettable. China's funeral reform still faces significant challenges.

Death is like the extinguishing of a lamp, with the soul no longer existing. However, perhaps due to the influence of feudal superstitions or the accumulation of traditional cultural psychology, some people believe in the immortality of the soul. Many people turn the sorrowful act of sending off the deceased into a grand "farewell." In recent years, in many places, the remembrance of the deceased is no longer limited to burning paper offerings and paper money; they also invite monks and Taoist priests, set up altars, and hold rituals to help the deceased's soul ascend to heaven and pray for their peace in the afterlife. As a result, people engaged in superstitious funeral activities have emerged. We cannot count the number of shamans and spirit mediums nationwide, but by the end of last year, Shanghai's Chongming County alone had identified over 650 such individuals.

Since the soul is believed to be immortal, the funeral offerings for the deceased have also "elevated" with the development of material civilization. In Anhui's Huabei and some economically developed areas, funeral offerings even include paper-made "color TVs," "refrigerators," and "cars." The market for superstitious items is bustling. A luxurious paper-made car with guards sells for 500 yuan.

A variety of elaborate and extravagant tombs have appeared. Along the 104 National Highway in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, over 110,000 tombs have emerged in recent years, each one unique. A Chen clan tomb in Ruian City covers 264 square meters and cost over 20,000 yuan to build.

Some people even build "living tombs" in anticipation of their own deaths, naming them "longevity tombs" or "living foundations." In Liuyang Village, Linxiang County, Hunan Province, a villager built a "living foundation" for his living parents in May last year, using 3,000 bricks, 0.5 tons of cement, 7 tons of stones, 0.3 tons of steel, and 0.2 tons of lime, with the tomb standing 1.7 meters high. There are thousands of such "living tombs" in Linxiang County. In Nanxiang Township, Wenzhou City, 60% of people over 60 have already built their own "longevity tombs." Disputes and fights over "dragon veins" and "feng shui" for building "living tombs" frequently occur.

To successfully implement funeral reforms, various levels of leadership must make firm decisions. In some places, due to lack of leadership attention, funeral services have become a situation of "upper levels call for it, middle levels observe, and lower levels do nothing." In such an atmosphere, traditional burials have resurged, and superstitious activities have reemerged. When leaders pay attention to funeral reforms, the results are significantly different. In 1986, the cremation rate in Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, was only 30.4%. In early 1987, the county committee and government included funeral reforms in their work agenda, with the deputy county magistrate in charge signing performance contracts with various townships, setting reward and punishment regulations, and the county's cremation rate that year increased to 92%. Huanghua City, Hebei Province, included funeral reform achievements in the performance evaluation indicators for township officials. Over the past few years, the county's cremation rate has consistently remained above 90%.

For a long time, China's funeral work has faced a universal contradiction: on one hand, the bereaved families place great importance on funerals and strongly demand good funeral services; on the other hand, the difficulties in funeral services have not been well addressed. China currently has over 1,200 funeral homes and nearly 4,000 cremation furnaces, all built in the 1950s and 1960s with a simple and makeshift approach. Most of the furnaces used are from the 1930s, consuming a lot of time, causing heavy pollution, and requiring high labor intensity. Many funeral homes do not even have vehicles to transport the deceased, so the bereaved families have to find their own means of transportation.

The Longhua and Baoxing funeral homes in Shanghai each handle nearly 48,000 deceased bodies annually for transportation, funeral services, and cremation, with extremely heavy workloads. The deceased storage rooms, refrigeration units, and urn storage rooms are all at full capacity, sometimes with no place to store the deceased, and the transportation vehicles are old and worn out, some even modified from discarded tricycles. Usually, one vehicle transports several deceased bodies, causing dissatisfaction among the bereaved families.

Currently, the national cremation rate is 30%. If it were to increase to 70%, the existing funeral facilities would be unable to handle the load. Therefore, updating and renovating funeral technology and facilities is an important task.

Death is an inevitable natural law. The calls for funeral reform are growing louder, and this needs to be taken seriously by the leadership.

### 殡葬改革符合民意

    殡葬改革符合民意
    本报记者　鲍洪俊
    就近一个时期读者反映殡葬工作中的问题，记者专访了民政部。
    我国的殡葬现状如何？民政部社会事务司副司长李舒珊向记者介绍说，去年全国死亡约600万人，火化率创记录，达30％，而1978年火化率是18％。努力10年，火化率只增加了12％。按照葬一尸需花费土地20平方米、木材0.5立方米、人民币1500元计算，1988年全国就有13万亩土地被死人占有，200万立方米木材葬诸黄土，70亿元人民币付之东流。如此浪费，令人痛惜。我国的殡葬改革依旧面临很大的困难。
    人死如灯灭，灵魂不复存。但是，或许是因为封建迷信思想的影响，或许是由于传统文化心理的积淀，一些人笃信灵魂不死。许多人把凄戚的送葬操办成悲壮的“送别”。这些年，不少地方对死者的悼念，已不满足于扎纸锞、烧纸钱，还要请和尚、道士，设灵台、做道场，以超度亡灵，祈保死者“地府”平安。由此，从事丧事迷信活动的人员应运而生。我们无法统计全国有多少巫婆、神汉在奔波忙碌，但是光上海崇明县去年年底就清查出650多人。
    既然灵魂不死，死者“享受”的殉葬品也随着物质文明的发展“升华”了。安徽淮北和一些经济条件较好的地方，殉葬品中甚至摆上了纸糊的“彩电”、“冰箱”、“轿车”。迷信品市场交易繁忙。一辆带卫士的豪华型纸糊轿车，售价500元。
    千姿百态、华丽异常的坟墓出现了。浙江温州市104国道线两侧，近年来冒出11万多座坟墓，每一座都不同凡响。瑞安市的一座陈氏宗族墓，占地264平方米，造价2万多元。
    有些人甚至“防患于未然”，建起“活人墓”，名之曰“寿坟”、“生基”。湖南临湘县刘阳村一位村民，去年5月为健在的父母做“生基”，用去红砖3000块，水泥0.5吨，石头7吨，钢材0.3吨，石灰0.2吨，墓高1.7米。这样的“活人墓”，临湘县有几千座。温州市南阳乡，60岁以上的老人，60％已为自己造好了“寿坟”。为建“活人墓”，争“龙脉”、占“风水”而引起的纠纷械斗，时有发生。
    殡葬改革要搞好，各级领导必须下决心。有的地方由于领导不重视，使殡仪工作形成“上面喊，中间看，到了基层没人干”的局面。在这种气氛下，土葬回潮，封建迷信活动死灰复燃。领导干部对殡葬改革重视了，效果大不一样。辽宁营口县1986年火化率只有30.4％，1987年初，县委、县政府把殡葬改革列入工作日程，由主管副县长与各乡镇签订了指标合同，规定了奖惩条例，全县的火化率当年就提高到92％。河北黄骅市将殡葬改革成绩列入乡镇干部的政绩考核指标之中。几年来，全县的火化率一直保持在90％以上。
    长期以来，我国的殡葬工作存在着一个普遍矛盾：一方面，丧主对丧事特别重视，强烈呼唤良好的殡仪服务；一方面，殡仪工作中存在的困难没有很好解决。我国现有1200多个殡仪馆，近4000台火化炉，都是五六十年代本着因陋就简的原则修建的，所用的火化炉大多是30年代的产品，耗时多，污染重，劳动强度大。许多殡仪馆连运送遗体的车也没有，只好由丧主设法解决运送工具。
    上海的龙华、宝兴两家殡仪馆，每年要承接近48000具遗体的接运、殡殓和火化工作，任务极其繁重。遗体停放间、防腐冰箱、骨灰盒存放间均处于饱和状态，有时遗体无处停放、运送遗体的车辆陈旧不堪，有的还是用已经淘汰的三轮车改装的。平时，一辆车常常接运几具遗体，招致丧主不满。
    现在，全国的火化率是30％，倘若提高至70％，现有的殡仪设施将不堪承受。所以，更新、改造殡仪技术、设施是一项重要任务。
    死是不可抗拒的自然规律。人们对殡葬改革的呼声越来越高，需要引起领导机关的重视。
