The White House spokesman announced tonight that President Bush has decided to issue export licenses for three communication satellites to be launched by China. At the same time, he decided to lift a ban on the Export-Import Bank providing loans to American companies doing business in China. A statement from the White House said that approving the export of satellites is in the national interest of the United States.

The three communication satellites were manufactured by the Hughes Aircraft Company in the United States for an Australian company and an Asian company, respectively. They are scheduled to be launched by China's "Long March" rockets over the next three years.
