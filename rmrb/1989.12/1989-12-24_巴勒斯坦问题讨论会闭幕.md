A four-day conference on the Palestinian issue, organized by the United Nations "Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People," concluded on December 21 in Kuala Lumpur.

During this conference, the Asian Regional Coordinating Committee of Non-Governmental Organizations for Palestine was established to coordinate the activities of non-governmental organizations in the region. Twelve countries, including China, became members of the committee. The host country, Malaysia, was elected as the chairman of the committee.

PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat sent a letter to the conference, urging the international community to continue to exert pressure on Israel and its supporter, the United States, to convene as soon as possible a Middle East peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of the PLO.
