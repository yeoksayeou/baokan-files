In the current challenging publishing environment, the publication of art books, especially those featuring paintings, is even more difficult. The exquisite binding and meticulous printing of art books make it hard to compile and publish collections of artworks. Therefore, when we see the China Foreign Trade and Education Press compiling and publishing a collection of over a hundred works by contemporary masters, we admire the efforts made by the editors to promote Chinese art.

This large, hardcover album, edited by Guan Zengzhu, reflects the achievements of contemporary Chinese painting. It includes influential figures in the Chinese painting world and their works. Among them are the late masters such as Qi Baishi, Huang Bin Hong, Chen Banding, He Xiangning, Wang Senran, Li Keran, Fu Baoshi, Jiang Zaohe, Xu Beihong, and Pan Tianshou. It also features living veterans of the art world, as well as young talents who have made significant innovations and achievements in recent years. The collection includes artists from mainland China, as well as from Hong Kong and Taiwan. The album showcases a diverse range of artistic styles, from elegant and refined to bold and profound; from meticulous brushwork to bold ink splashes and striking compositions. It includes works in the Wu School style and the Lingnan School style, as well as landscapes and portraits, capturing vast scenes in a small space, making viewers marvel at the beauty.

The editors aim to present the brilliance of Chinese art through the introduction of works by over a hundred artists and brief evaluations of their personalities, contributing to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

Notably, the album is printed in a large quarto format, using high-quality, non-glossy copperplate paper and offset paper for color printing, adding to the splendor of the artworks.

    读《当代中国画名家精萃》
    翟超
    在目前出版业不景气的情况下，书画的出版较之一般的图书更为困难。由于画册精美的装帧和画面制图（版）效果的讲究，使一些艺术精品难以收编成集。因此，当我们看到对外贸易教育出版社荟萃当代名家画作百十余幅，选辑出版时，为编者弘扬中华艺术所付出的努力投以钦佩的目光。
    这本以反映当代中国画艺术成就的大型精装画册（主编关增铸），收录了当代影响中国画坛举足轻重的人物和他们的作品。其中有齐白石、黄宾虹、陈半丁、何香凝、王森然、李苦禅、傅抱石、蒋兆和、徐悲鸿、潘天寿等已作古的画坛泰斗，也有当今仍健在的画坛宿将；还有近年来以革新创造取得瞩目成就的新秀，收入的画家除大陆的外，也有香港和台湾的。画集在艺术风格上博采众长，有的秀丽儒雅，有的雄浑深沉；有的工笔玲珑，有的泼墨点染、峻峭高拔。有吴门风格，也有岭南画派。有风光、有人物，咫尺万里、方寸大千，令人美不胜收。其中收入了目前我国第一长卷一百七十米人物画和自春秋至近代诗人学者五百余人的通史画，以及世界第一长卷六百米《长城万里图》。
    画集的编者拟通过对百名画家作品的介绍和人物的小评，展现灿烂光彩的中国艺术，并为社会主义精神文明建设作出贡献。
    值得提及的是，画集以四开本之巨成册，并配以高级无光铜版纸和胶版纸彩印，为绚丽的艺术增光添彩。
