Since 1988, abnormal weather patterns have cast a shadow over the entire globe:
	Heat waves turned Shanghai into a giant oven, droughts withered the western grasslands, leaving them desolate; hurricanes struck the Mexican coast; floods swept across vast areas of Bangladesh; Japan's islands were helpless against continuous heavy rains...
	In the face of such terrifying phenomena, people cannot help but ask: Why has nature, once so gentle and generous, become so ferocious?

	Experts explain: This is because humans have not cherished our living environment, recklessly destroying the ecological balance of nature and causing massive industrial pollution, thereby provoking nature's retaliatory disasters.

	In 1979, the promulgation of the "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China" marked the beginning of China's environmental protection work transitioning from general advocacy to legal supervision and management.

	In 1983, at the Second National Conference on Environmental Protection, the Chinese government announced that environmental protection is one of China's fundamental national policies. It formulated the principle of planning, implementing, and developing economic construction, urban and rural construction, and environmental construction in tandem, unifying economic benefits, social benefits, and environmental benefits. The policy of "who pollutes, who cleans up" was implemented.

	It is worth noting that China is a developing country with 1.1 billion people, with limited per capita resources and immense environmental pressures. Although we have achieved some successes in environmental governance, due to various historical and contemporary reasons, environmental pollution and ecological degradation remain severe.

	The direct economic losses caused by environmental pollution and ecological damage have accumulated to hundreds of billions of yuan.

	Recently, during an inspection in Jiangxi, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, emphasized that afforestation and environmental protection are our strategic policies. China, with one-quarter of the world's population, bears important responsibilities and obligations for the global environment. If China's environmental protection is well-managed, it will be a significant contribution to all of humanity.

	To adapt to the global trend of environmental protection and fundamentally improve China's environmental quality, experts, based on their investigations and research, have called for efforts to raise the environmental awareness of the entire nation and mobilize all available forces to "declare war on environmental pollution."

	During the interviews, the reporter collected opinions and suggestions from various experts, mainly in six aspects:

	1. In the current context of rectification and economic austerity, efforts must be made to prevent the decline of environmental awareness and to raise people's consciousness. At the same time, environmental protection should be regarded as an important component of spiritual civilization construction. Nationwide, a social moral norm should be established where protecting the environment is glorious, polluting the environment is shameful, and everyone protects the environment.

	2. The media and propaganda departments should vigorously promote advanced examples of environmental protection, expose behaviors that pollute the environment and damage the ecosystem, and place those malicious acts under the supervision of the masses.

	3. The law must be strictly enforced, with severe penalties for violations.

	4. Government departments at all levels and enterprises should strengthen management, set strict standards, and implement measures such as position responsibility systems, assessment and reward systems, and target responsibility systems for environmental management and waste treatment. Environmental governance should also be an important criterion for evaluating the performance of leading departments and identifying advanced individuals and units.

	5. Environmental protection departments should actively participate in the current industrial restructuring, closely cooperate with local governments, and promote the closure, suspension, merger, transformation, and relocation of enterprises with unreasonable layouts and severe pollution.

	6. Environmental protection departments should focus on their own construction, actively and proactively engage with society, fully understand and grasp the industrial development status, trends, enterprise pollution status, and relevant energy consumption coefficients in their regions. This will provide a basis for adapting environmental protection work to the needs of economic development and for scientifically managing the environment.

### 向环境污染宣战——专家治理污染的建议

    向环境污染宣战
    ——专家治理污染的建议
    新华社记者　杨兆波
    1988年以来，异常的气候阴影笼罩了全球：
    热浪使中国上海变成了一台烤箱，旱灾使西部大草原枯萎、萧条；飓风袭击了墨西哥沿岸；洪水扫荡了孟加拉国大片国土；日本列岛在连绵大雨面前束手无策……
    人们在惊恐之中不禁要问：一向温顺而慷慨的大自然何以变得如此狂暴？
    专家们回答：这是由于人类不珍惜我们的生存环境，肆无忌惮地破坏大自然的生态平衡和大规模的工业污染，从而引起了大自然对人类施以各种灾害性惩罚。
    1979年，《中华人民共和国环境保护法》的问世，使我国环境保护工作开始从一般号召发展到依法监督管理的轨道。
    1983年，在全国第二次环境保护工作会议上，我国政府宣布了环境保护是我国的一项基本国策。并且制订了经济建设、城乡建设和环境建设同步规划、同步实施、同步发展，经济效益、社会效益和环境效益相统一发展的方针，实行了“谁污染，谁治理”的政策。
    不容忽视的是，我国是一个拥有11亿人口的发展中国家，人均资源并不丰富，环境压力很大。虽然我们在环境治理方面取得了一些成就，然而，由于历史和现实的种种原因，环境污染和生态恶化仍很严重。
    因环境污染而造成的经济损失和生态破坏造成的直接经济损失累计达到数百亿元。
    最近，中共中央总书记江泽民在江西视察时强调，植树造林，保护环境，是我们的战略方针，占世界1／4人口的中国，对人类环境负有重要责任和义务，中国本身的环境保护搞好了，就是对整个人类的贡献。
    为适应世界性的保护环境的大趋势，并从根本上改变我国的环境质量，专家们在调查研究的基础上发出呼吁，必须着力提高全民族的环境意识，动员一切可以动员的力量，“向环境污染宣战”。
    记者在采访中集纳了各方专家的意见、建议，主要包括六个方面：
    一、在目前治理整顿、经济紧缩的情况下，要制止环境意识的“滑坡”，提高人们的思想认识。同时，要把环境保护作为精神文明建设的重要组成部分来抓，在全国范围内，建立一种保护环境光荣，污染环境可耻，人人保护环境的社会道德规范。
    二、新闻、宣传部门要大张旗鼓地宣传环境保护的先进典型，揭露那些污染环境、破坏生态的行为，使那些丑恶行为置于人民群众的监督之下。
    三、要依法办事，做到执法必严，违法必究。
    四、各级政府部门、企事业单位要强化管理，严格要求，对于环境管理、“三废”处理等问题，要实行岗位责任制、考核奖赔制、目标责任制等措施，并且要把环境治理作为考核领导部门的政绩和先进个人及先进单位的重要内容。
    五、环保部门要积极参与目前进行的工业结构调整，与各地政府密切配合，推动那些布局不合理、污染严重的企业进行关、停、并、转、迁的工作。
    六、环保部门要注重自身建设，积极主动地渗透到社会上，充分掌握和了解本区域工业发展的状况、发展趋势、企业的环境污染状况，以及有关的耗能系数等，从而为使环保工作适应经济发展的需要以及科学地进行环境管理提供依据。
