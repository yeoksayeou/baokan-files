On a clear day in early winter, the construction site of the Taihe section of the Heihe River, one of the three major water control projects during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," was quiet. There were no scenes of thousands of workers laboring together, no deafening shouts of workers, and no temporary sheds stretching towards the sky...

On November 26, 1988, with the approval of the State Council, 157.09 million yuan was allocated to control the Heihe River. The 2994 square kilometers of people in the Heihe River basin were overjoyed. This river, originating from Taikang County, Henan, and flowing through eight counties in Henan and Anhui provinces before merging into the Yingshui River, has historically suffered from "yellow disasters" that have silted up the river channels, causing floods to be unable to drain and droughts to be unable to irrigate, causing trouble almost every year. In the early days of liberation, due to limited conditions, the control standards were low, and the two banks still suffered from disasters. From 1951 to 1985, Taihe County experienced 15 years of floods and droughts in 35 years, with an average annual affected area of 310,000 mu.

On April 3, 1989, when the Anhui Provincial Water Resources Department officially allocated 80.318 million yuan to Taihe County to control this troublesome river, the county's chief commander for controlling the Heihe River, Lian Huai Xiu, and political commissar Zhang Xi De could not be happy. They thought of the West Beihe project two years ago. In the snow, more than 100,000 workers and over 1,000 cadres worked tirelessly for an entire winter and spring. The state's allocated funds were all spent, and farmers raised over 600 million yuan to buy tools. The entire county of 1.17 million farmers each contributed more than 5 yuan. The West Beihe River was only a 2 million cubic meter earthwork project, but the current Heihe River needs to complete 16.5 million cubic meters of earthwork. If calculated in this way, at least 200,000 workers and 1,300 cadres would be needed to work tirelessly for four winters and springs, increasing the burden on farmers by over 500 million yuan. That would surely impoverish Taihe.

"Contract it out." The first time in Taihe County's water control history to contract out to external parties was bid out under these circumstances. The Huaiyuan County Water Resources Bureau's mechanized construction team won the bid at the bidding meeting on July 25 this year, contracting the second section of the Taihe section from the Gulou River mouth to the Honglian Gulou mouth, a 6.315-kilometer-long project.

At the Huaiyuan team's command center, the commander, former Huaiyuan County Water Resources Bureau director Sun Wen Guo, told us: They now have 70 excavating and bulldozing machines, including 22 self-owned, 17 from Huaiyuan County's commune and enterprise bureau, 5 from Funan County, and 26 individual machines. Sun Wen Guo is a shrewd and practical contractor. For the convenience of construction, he divided the 70 machines into 10 teams and construction points, evenly distributed along the 6-kilometer-long section. Each team and construction point is equipped with one cook, one accountant, and one team leader. Each machine, along with three drivers, averages no more than 3.5 people. The construction team implements single-machine contracting. For state-owned machines, the contractor deducts a fixed proportion of the completed earthwork funds monthly as remuneration. For individual machines, the construction team deducts a 3% management fee from the contractor's completed earthwork funds monthly, with the rest going to the individual. Single-machine contracting greatly motivates the entire team. The 70 machines all operate in three shifts, working 22 hours a day.

Sun Wen Guo accompanied us to the river dam. The entire construction site was in view. From a distance, excavators and bulldozers looked like red dots moving up and down the river dam. The four excavators nearby were excavating the upper mouth of the Heihe River. The huge bucket could excavate 2.5 cubic meters at a time, and in the blink of an eye, it climbed to the top of the high dam. One excavator can complete 300 to 400 cubic meters a day, equivalent to the work of 350 workers in a day. Sun Wen Guo happily told us: According to the current progress of the team's project, the project time can be shortened by 1/3 compared to the contract time. We then carefully examined the quality of the riverbed, inner slope, and river embankment projects. The dividing walls and ditches that were visible during manual labor are gone. The wide dam top is flattened and compacted by the wide tracks of the excavators, and there is no need for workers to sweat profusely carrying wooden rams.

According to the county command department's comrades, due to the implementation of bidding and contracting, time was gained. The entire section will be completed by the end of 1991, reducing the construction period by one year compared to 200,000 workers. After the project was contracted out, except for the state's allocated funds, it basically did not require the masses to raise funds, and the total funds were also used less. Indeed, with the current national strength, it is not possible to fully realize mechanization in inland river control, but it is indeed a direction.

    机械化施工在黑茨河
    汝鸣　黄连广
    初冬的一个晴天，在黑茨河这块“七五”期间全国三大重点治水工程之一的太和段工地上，没有昔日千军万马齐上阵的壮阔场景，听不到此起彼伏震耳欲聋的民工号子，也看不见铺向云天的临时工棚……
    1988年11月26日，经国务院同意，正式拨款1.5709亿元治理黑茨河，2994平方公里的黑茨河流域人民是多么喜悦啊。这条发源于河南太康县、跨越豫皖两省8县汇入颍河的河流，历史上因“黄害”淤积河道，洪不畅泄，旱不能蓄灌，几乎年年为患。解放初期，限于条件，治理标准较低，两岸仍旧灾害不断。太和县从1951年至1985年35年间，洪涝灾害就有15年，受灾面积年平均达31万亩。
    1989年4月3日，当安徽省水利厅将8031.8万元的巨款正式拨给太和县治理这条害河的时候，县治理黑茨河总指挥廉怀秀，政委张西德却怎么也高兴不起来。他们又想起了两年前的西淝河工程。冰雪中，10万多民工、千余名干部，整整苦干了一个冬春，国家的拨款全部开销了，农民又集资600余万元买工具，全县117万农民人均拿出5元钱以上。西淝河仅仅是200万土方的工程啊，眼下的黑茨河，需完成土方1650万。照此推算，至少要20多万民工，1300多名干部，苦干4个冬春，增加农民负担5000余万元，那还不把个太和治穷。
    “包出去。”太和县治水史上的第一次对外承包，就在这种情况下招标了。怀远县水利局机械化施工队在今年7月25日的招标会上中标了，承包了太和段从谷河口到红莲沟口6.315公里的第二段治理工程。
    在怀远队指挥部，总指挥、原怀远县水利局长孙文国告诉我们：他们现在已拥有铲运、推土机械70台，其中自有22台，怀远县社队企业局17台，阜南县5台，个体机械26台。孙文国是位精明务实的承包者。为方便施工，他将70台机械分成10个班组、施工点，匀布在6公里长的工段上。每个班组、施工点配一名炊事员、一名会计、一名班组长，每台机械连同3名驾驶员平均不超3.5人。施工队实行单机承包。国营机械，承包者每月按固定比例从完成土方款中提取报酬。个体机械，施工队每月除按3％的比例从承包者完成的土方款中提取管理费外，其余全归个人。单机承包极大地调动了全队的积极性，70台机械全部实行三班制、每天工作22小时。
    孙文国陪我们走上河坝，整个工地尽收眼底。远远望去，铲运机、推土机像红点点在河坝上下滚动着。近处的4台铲运机正在铲削黑茨河的上口，那巨大的铲斗一下就是2.5立方米，眨眼功夫就爬上了高高的坝顶。一台铲运机一天可完成三四百立方米，相当于350名民工一天的工作量。孙文国愉快地告诉我们：按照目前本队的工程进度推算，工程比合同规定时间可缩短1／3。我们再仔细查看河床、内坡和河堤的工程质量，昔日民工施工时的界墙、界沟不见了，那宽阔的坝顶被铲运机宽大的履带轧得坚实平坦，再也用不着民工们挥汗如雨抬木夯了。
    据县指挥部的同志介绍，由于实行招标承包，赢得了时间。1991年底将全段竣工，比20万民工上阵，工期将缩短一年。工程承包出去后，除国家拨款外，基本不要群众集资，总的资金也少用了。诚然，按照目前的国力，内河治理还不可能完全实现机械化，但它毕竟是一个方向。
