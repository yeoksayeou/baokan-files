    This is the land of flowers, where the mountains and wilds are adorned with clouds and mist,
    Dyeing the body with brocade hues as birds fly by, immersing their wings in fragrance.
    A tent is pitched on the flowers, and a clear spring flows beneath them.
    The dreams of shepherds, disturbed by wind and snow, are especially refreshing in the moonlight among the flowers.
    The ground orchids spread along the snowy ground, and the black-necked crane pecks at the frozen wasteland.
    Blue sapphires comfort the melting snow in the hollows, and the snow lotus blesses the Qiang domain with good fortune.
    They complement each other, finding their own grasslands and hills according to their colors and personalities.
    Enduring the cold years, disregarding the lack of admirers, they bloom with all their might.
    Seizing the moment when winter breaks, they perform on the stage of spring, warming the snow and brightening the sunlight.
    They entice the shepherds' love songs to flow endlessly.
    The Yangtze River source, the origin of flowers, flows downstream with colors and fragrance.
