Hong Kong's economic growth has slowed this year, but its fundamental advantages remain intact, and the outlook for the 1990s is promising.

The last year of the 1980s is coming to an end. Hong Kong's economy, despite facing several challenges, has achieved relatively good results this year. The gross domestic product is expected to reach over 253.4 billion dollars. Both visible and invisible trade have created a record surplus. According to the government's figures released on December 24, the total value of exports in the first 11 months of this year exceeded 520 billion dollars, an increase of 70 billion dollars compared to the same period last year. The re-export growth rate reached 28%, which is quite impressive. Hong Kong's position as an international financial center remains stable, and the banking sector's lending and financing to local manufacturing and trade industries have also performed well. Industries such as finance, trade, services, real estate, transportation, tourism, information, and stock and currency markets are all showing trends of functional and operational diversification. These new trends are promoting economic structural adjustments. This year, the proportion of finance, services, and commerce in the GDP has continued to increase.

Citizens' incomes are increasing year by year, with the average annual income per capita expected to reach $10,000.

Hong Kong's economy, which has experienced high growth for several consecutive years, has slowed down this year. This slowdown did not start in May or June. In fact, the signs of slowing down in external trade were already evident in the first half of the year. From January to June, the growth rates of Hong Kong's exports and re-exports, as well as imports, were lower than the same period last year, although this was masked by the absolute values of short-term growth. Hong Kong's economic fluctuations are related to the global economic situation. In the second half of this year, due to various internal and external negative factors, the local economic situation has become sluggish. The situation is gradually improving as winter approaches. The Hong Kong government predicts that the local economic growth rate for the year will be 3%, while some local businesspeople and scholars estimate it to be higher than the official figure. After experiencing a period of high-speed development in the 1980s, Hong Kong's economy is expected to slow down next year. However, there is no need to be pessimistic. Hong Kong remains the "Pearl of the Orient." It is backed by the mainland and faces the ocean, enjoying geographical advantages. The conditions for all-round opening up and free competition, low tax policies, complete modern infrastructure, and a mature international trade environment are all superior to some neighboring countries and regions, maintaining strong attractiveness.

Its status as an international financial center, a modern commercial and trade center, and a modern information center has not been weakened. In particular, as the "gateway" to mainland China and a bridge to the world, it is irreplaceable by other places. This is the important reason why many foreign investments continue to flow into Hong Kong even during the sluggish period in the second half of the year.

Of course, there will be many negative factors next year, but there will also be some positive factors, some of which will have long-term positive effects. The continued implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the timely promulgation of the Basic Law will provide fundamental guarantees for Hong Kong's comprehensive development and smooth transition to 1997. China's commitment to reform and opening up, and the advancement of economic restructuring, will make Hong Kong, as a "near-water pavilion," benefit more and more.

Hong Kong's economic slowdown next year will be beneficial in curbing overheating and promoting internal adjustments and transformations. In the coming 1990s, Hong Kong's economy will undoubtedly become more prosperous and thriving.

    今年香港经济增长放缓
    有利于明年内部调整和转型
    本报香港12月26日电　今年香港经济增长放缓，基本优势健在，九十年代前景看好。
    八十年代的最后一年即将过去。香港的经济在这一年里几经风雨仍创下较好实绩。今年生产总值可达2534亿元以上（港元，以下同），有形贸易与无形贸易合创顺差纪录。据港府24日公布的最新数字，今年头11个月，出口货品总值逾5200亿元，较去年同期增加700亿元，转口增幅达28％，可谓不俗。香港的国际金融中心地位相当稳固，银行业对当地制造业、贸易业的贷款和融资表现亦不俗。工业、外贸、金融、服务、地产、交通、商业、旅游、信息和股汇金市等领域或行业，均呈现功能多元化、经营多元化的趋势。这些新趋势又促进经济结构的调整。今年，金融、服务、商业在生产总值中所占比重继续加大。
    市民收入与年俱增，按人平均的年入息，预计可达到一万美元。
    连续几年实现高增长的香港经济，全年放缓了步速。放缓并非从5、6月始。其实，上半年的对外贸易已露减缓的征兆。1至6月，港产品的出口和转口、进口的增幅均低于去年同期，只不过被短期增长的绝对值所掩盖。香港经济之起落，与世界经济态势相关。今年下半年，由于外部与内部的多种利淡因素的影响，此地经济景气转趋低迷。入冬方渐回暖。香港府预计，本港全年经济增长率为3％，而此间一些工商界人士、学者的估计高于官方。香港经济于80年代经历高速发展阶段之后，明年放缓大势已定。但无须悲观。香港仍然是东方明珠。它背倚大陆，面对重洋，独拥地利之优势。全方位开放，宜于自由竞争的条件，低税政策，完善的现代基础设施，成熟的国际贸易环境，都优于邻近一些国家和地区，仍具强磁力。
    其国际金融中心、现代商贸中心和现代化讯息中心的地位没有削弱，尤其是作为中国内地的“门户”和通向世界的桥梁，更非其它地方可以替代。这正是下半年的低迷期仍有多国外资源源投入香港的重要原因。
    当然，明年会有不少利淡因素，但也会增添一些利好因素，有的是长期起好作用的。中英联合声明继续有效地执行，基本法如期正式通过，都将给香港的全面发展和顺利过渡“97”提供根本保证。中国坚持开放改革，推进经济治理整顿，香港必是“近水楼台先得月”，受惠更多更大。
    而香港明年经济的放缓，既有利于抑止过热，也有利于内部调整和转型。在未来的90年香港经济必将出现更加繁荣兴旺的局面。
