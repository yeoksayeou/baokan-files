Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, December 22nd.

Fighter jets and bombers crisscrossed the skies, military helicopters hovered low, and tanks and various military vehicles rumbled through the streets. American soldiers in camouflage, faces painted with war paint, brandished assault rifles, charging through residential areas like demons. The sounds of cannon fire, gunshots, and bombing never ceased. This is the terrifying scene in Panama City, the capital of Panama, under the U.S. military's brutal occupation.

Today marks the third day since the flames of aggression have spread across the entire Isthmus of Panama, and the third day since the U.S. military has been slaughtering the city. According to the U.S. military's significantly reduced figures, 279 people in Panama have been killed by U.S. gunfire, including 59 military personnel who died in battle and 220 innocent civilians who were shot to death. Hundreds more have been injured. Major hospitals in the capital are overflowing with wounded patients, and many have died due to the inability to receive timely medical treatment. Under the fierce resistance of Panama's patriotic military and civilians, more than 30 U.S. soldiers have been killed and over 200 injured.

At 1 AM on the 20th, the U.S. military first stormed into Panama City from the Chorrillo district, which borders the Canal Zone. This is the location of the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters and General Noriega's office, and it is also a poor area predominantly inhabited by blacks and mixed-race people. The U.S. military conducted extensive bombing and shelling, causing many dilapidated wooden houses to collapse and catch fire, instantly filling the air with smoke and flames. Many elderly people and children were killed or injured on the spot, and more than 5,000 residents were displaced, becoming refugees.

In pursuit of Panamanian military officers and to capture General Noriega, the commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the U.S. military recklessly stormed into residential areas, firing indiscriminately. The Xinhua News Agency's bureau in Panama is located in the San Francisco district, where Noriega and the ruling party chairman, Endara, have their residences, as well as embassies of Cuba and other countries. This made it a target for the U.S. military to attack and clear out. For three days, bombers and reconnaissance planes have continuously flown low over the rooftops of civilian homes, and U.S. military tanks and convoys frequently pass by the bureau, shooting and bombing along the way, causing chaos. To storm into the Marriott Hotel near the bureau to capture military officers, the U.S. military fired indiscriminately, killing a 30-something Spanish photographer on the spot.

After entering the city, the U.S. military dispersed the police and traffic officers, allowing prisoners to escape from jail and join forces with criminals to loot the city. Most supermarkets, food stores, and convenience stores in the capital and Colón City have been ransacked. Chinatown and other areas where overseas Chinese and Chinese merchants operate have been subjected to looting. In Colón City, a Chinese merchant surnamed Zhang was killed by thugs, and a Chinese merchant called to report that the "China Restaurant" in the city center had been robbed of tens of thousands of dollars, and a gaming arcade owned by a Chinese merchant had been broken into, with $190,000 and a safe stolen.

The U.S. military rampaged into the interior. A female teacher called from 200 kilometers away to report that after the U.S. military's airborne troops attacked the Rio Hato military base, they captured 150 cadets from the "Thomas Herrera" military academy within the base. These 14- to 18-year-old children were subjected to humiliation, beatings, and some were even killed by the U.S. military.

However, the patriotic military and civilians of Panama have not surrendered to the U.S. military's iron hooves. After the main forces were defeated by the U.S. military's superior strength, the scattered defense forces and more than 1,800 "Dignity Battalion" militia continue to bravely resist the U.S. invasion in the capital and its suburbs. This afternoon, hundreds of armed individuals, defying the enemy, suddenly attacked the U.S.-established Southern Command in the Canal Zone and the Parliament Building, the seat of the U.S.-backed government. Although they were outnumbered and outmatched, and ultimately failed, they demonstrated the courage and determination of the Panamanian people, who have a glorious tradition of struggle, to fearlessly defend their national sovereignty and dignity and fight to the death against the invaders.

    美军铁蹄下的巴拿马
    新华社记者　胡泰然
    战斗机、轰炸机穿梭呼啸，军用直升机低空盘旋，成建制的坦克和各种军车隆隆驶过街道，身穿迷彩服、画着花脸的美国兵手持冲锋枪，凶神恶煞般在居民区横冲直撞。炮声、枪声、轰炸声不绝于耳。这就是眼下美军武力侵占下的巴拿马首都巴拿马城的恐怖景象。
    今天，已是侵略战火蔓延整个巴拿马地峡的第3天，也是美军血腥屠城第3天。据美国军方透露的大大缩小了的数字，巴拿马共有279人死于美军枪弹之下，其中59名军人抗战牺牲，220名和平居民无辜饮弹被害，受伤者数以百计。首都各大医院伤员暴满，许多人因无法得到急救而死亡。在巴拿马爱国军民顽强抵抗下，美军有30多人死亡，200多人受伤。
    20日凌晨1点，美军首先从与运河区接壤的乔里略区闯进巴拿马首都。这是巴拿马国防军总部和诺列加将军办公室所在地，也是以黑人和混血人为主的穷苦人居住区。美军大肆轰炸、炮击，许多破旧木房倒塌着火，顿时烟雾窒人，火光冲天。不少老人、儿童当场被打死打伤，5000多居民流离失所，成了难民。
    美军为了追捕巴军军官，为了把巴拿马国防军司令诺列加将军“捉拿归案”，擅自冲进居民区开枪扫射。新华社驻巴拿马分社所在的圣弗朗西斯科区，有诺列加和执政党主席杜克的住宅，还有古巴等使馆，这就成了美军攻占清剿的目标。3天来，轰炸机和侦察机不断低空掠过民宅的屋顶，美军和坦克车队不时从分社门前开过，一路开枪打炮，闹得混乱不堪。美军为冲进分社附近的马里奥特旅馆抓捕国防军军官，胡乱开枪，当场打死1名30多岁的西班牙摄影记者。
    美军进城后，打散了民警和交通警，监狱犯人乘机逃出，与社会上不法分子大肆抢劫，首都和科隆市绝大部分超级市场、食品店、杂货铺被洗劫一空。唐人街等地华侨和华人商店横遭偷抢，科隆市姓张的华侨当场被歹徒打死，一位华侨打电话告诉记者说，首都市中心的“中国酒家”被抢走数万美元，华人开的一家游艺场被歹徒破门而入，19万美元连同保险箱被抢走。
    美军肆虐进攻内地。一位女教师远从200公里外打电话告诉记者说，美军空降部队袭击里约阿托军事基地后，竟然把基地内的“托马斯·埃雷拉”军校150名学员抓了起来。这些14岁到18岁的孩子横遭美军凌辱、打骂，有的惨遭杀害。
    但是，巴拿马爱国军民并没有屈服于美军铁蹄之下，在主力部队被美军优势兵力打垮后，零散国防军和1800多名“尊严大队”民兵仍在首都及其近郊英勇抵抗美军入侵。今天中午，数百名武装人员蔑视强敌，突然袭击了美国设在运河区的南方司令部和美军扶植起来的政府所在地议会大厦。他们虽然由于力量悬殊，寡不敌众而失败，但表现出了有着光荣斗争传统的巴拿马人民不畏强暴，坚决维护民族主权和尊严而敢于同入侵者血战到底的英勇气概。
