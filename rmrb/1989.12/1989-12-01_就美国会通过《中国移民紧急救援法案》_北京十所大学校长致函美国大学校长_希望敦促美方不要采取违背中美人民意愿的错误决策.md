Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 30th.

On November 29th, the presidents of ten universities in Beijing jointly wrote to the presidents of American universities. They sincerely hoped that their American counterparts could, from the perspective of maintaining friendly relations between China and the United States and between Chinese and American universities, convey to American legislators, various sectors of society, and faculty and students within their institutions the potential consequences. They urged the U.S. Congress and government to adhere to the agreements and understandings reached between China and the United States on educational exchanges, and not to make decisions that go against the will of the peoples of both countries.

The ten university presidents in Beijing are: Professor Wu Shuqing, President of Peking University; Professor Zhang Xiaowen, President of Tsinghua University; Professor Shen Shituan, President of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Professor Wang Run, President of Beijing University of Science and Technology; Professor Qu Miyu, President of Beijing Medical University; Professor Shi Yuanshun, President of Beijing Agricultural University; Professor Fang Fukan, President of Beijing Normal University; Professor Luo Guojie, Vice President of Renmin University of China; Professor Wang Fuxiang, President of Beijing Foreign Studies University; and Professor Zhu Hesun, President of Beijing Institute of Technology.

In their open letter to the presidents of American universities, they stated that in recent years, the ten universities have established good cooperative relationships with their American counterparts in areas such as teaching, scientific research, and talent exchange, and have achieved significant results. They hoped that this cooperation would continue to develop and improve. However, they recently learned that the U.S. House and Senate passed the "Chinese Student Protection Act" on the 19th and 20th, respectively, which abolished the requirement for Chinese students holding exchange scholar visas to return to China for two years of service upon completion of their studies. This would undoubtedly create significant obstacles for Chinese government-sponsored students returning to serve their country and would also cause great difficulties for the work of their institutions. If this bill is enacted and implemented, it will undoubtedly have a very negative impact on educational exchanges and friendly interactions between Chinese and American universities. They expressed deep concern and attention to this matter.

The open letter stated that this bill was proposed under the pretext of protecting Chinese students in the United States from "persecution" by the Chinese government. The ten presidents are witnesses to the facts. Currently, the situation in China has stabilized; democracy and the rule of law are increasingly robust; teaching and scientific research activities within universities are proceeding normally; exchanges and cooperation with other countries are proceeding smoothly; and many students studying abroad, including those in the United States, have returned to China. After their return, their work and living arrangements have been properly taken care of, and they are diligently working for the construction of the country and the development of their universities. For example, in the ten universities, 236 students have returned since June, and many more have returned for vacations, family visits, or official trips. Those who have returned to work have been warmly welcomed and properly arranged. Those who have returned for short vacations or family visits have also been warmly welcomed, and they have faced no issues when returning to the United States or other countries where they are studying. The facts prove that there is no "persecution." Many enlightened Americans and American visitors to China are aware of and have witnessed this reality. Therefore, the basis for the recent bill proposed by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives does not exist, and its pretext is entirely without factual basis. They expressed deep regret over this.

The open letter further stated that they knew the normalization of relations between China and the United States was hard-won, and that educational exchanges and interactions between Chinese and American universities had a long history. Especially in the past ten years, China has implemented a policy of reform and opening up. Many Chinese and American universities have established friendly inter-university relationships; some have signed bilateral agreements. These have been beneficial for deepening the friendship between the peoples of China and the United States and for promoting cooperation and exchanges in higher education between the two countries. Countries cooperating to exchange students and jointly cultivate talent is beneficial to both sides and is a common international practice. The passage of this bill by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives sets a precedent for disrupting international agreements and normal cultural exchanges. If this bill is enacted, it will seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and inevitably provoke a strong response from the Chinese government. This would undoubtedly damage the inter-university relationships that have been established and make it difficult to implement the bilateral agreements that have been signed, which would undoubtedly bring great losses to both sides. It is clear that the consequences of this bill would be very serious. They did not want to see the situation develop in a direction that is unfavorable to both sides, and they did not want to see the serious situation of interrupting educational exchanges between China and the United States.

### 就美国会通过《中国移民紧急救援法案》  北京十所大学校长致函美国大学校长  希望敦促美方不要采取违背中美人民意愿的错误决策

    就美国会通过《中国移民紧急救援法案》
    北京十所大学校长致函美国大学校长
    希望敦促美方不要采取违背中美人民意愿的错误决策
    新华社北京11月30日电　北京十所大学校长昨天联名致函美国大学校长，真诚地希望美国同行们能从维护中美两国和中美大学之间的友好关系出发，并通过他们，向美国议员和各界人士以及校内师生说明利害关系，敦促美国国会和政府恪守中美双方以往达成的教育交流的协议和谅解，不要采取违背中美两国人民意愿的错误的决策。
    北京这十所大学校长是：北京大学校长吴树青教授、清华大学校长张孝文教授、北京航空航天大学校长沈士团教授、北京科技大学校长王润教授、北京医科大学校长曲绵域教授、北京农业大学校长石元春教授、北京师范大学校长方福康教授、中国人民大学副校长罗国杰教授、北京外国语学院院长王福祥教授、北京理工大学校长朱鹤孙教授。
    他们在致美国大学校长的公开信中说，近几年来，我们这十所大学与你们之间已建立了良好的合作关系，教学、科研和人才交流等方面的合作，都已经取得了成效。我们希望这种合作在今后将会得到更好的发展。但是，最近我们得悉，美国众、参两院于19日和20日分别通过了《中国移民紧急救援法案》，取消了持交换学者签证的中国留学人员在学业期满后必须回国服务两年的规定，这无疑将给我公派留学人员回国服务造成极大的障碍，同时也给我们院校的工作造成很大的困难。如果此法案生效并实施，必将对中美大学之间的教育交流和友好往来产生非常不利的影响，我们都对此表示深切的忧虑和关注。
    公开信说，这个法案是借口所谓保护中国在美留学人员免受我政府“迫害”为由提出的。我们十位校长都是事实的见证人。目前，中国的局势已经稳定；民主和法制日趋健全；大学内的教学、科研活动都在正常进行；与各国的交往和合作都在正常地开展；不少在国外留学的人员包括留美人员陆续回国。他们回国以后的工作、生活等都得到了妥善的安排，他们正在为国家的建设、学校的建设而勤奋地工作。就以我们十所大学为例，6月以来，已有236名留学人员回到学校，还有不少留学人员回国休假、探亲或公务旅行。回国工作的人员都受到我们热烈的欢迎，并得到妥善的安排。短期回国休假、探亲等人员，不仅受到了欢迎，他们重新返回美国或其它在学国家，也都不存在任何问题。事实证明，根本不存在受“迫害”的情况。许多美国有识之士和来华访问的美国各界人士对这种真实情况是了解的，也是有目共睹的。因此，最近美国参、众两院所提出的“法案”的依据是不存在的，其“借口”也是毫无事实根据的。我们不得不对此深表遗憾。
    公开信又说，我们知道，中美两国关系的正常化来之不易，中美大学之间的教育交流和往来也已有很长的历史。特别是近10年来，中国实行改革开放政策，我们中美大学之间，有的建立了友好的校际关系；有的签署了双边协议，这些都有利于加深中美人民之间的友谊，也有利于促进两国高等教育的合作和交流。国与国之间通过交换留学人员合作培养人才，对双方都是有利的，这也是国际上通行的办法。美国参、众两院通过这个“法案”，开了一个破坏国际协议和正常文化交流的先例。如果这个法案得以生效，将严重伤害中国人民的感情，势必引起中国政府方面强烈的反响。这样，我们双方建立起来的校际关系将受破坏，签署的双边协议将难以执行，这无疑对双方都将带来巨大的损失。显而易见，这个“法案”的后果将是十分严重的。我们不希望看到事态向不利于双方的方向发展，我们更不希望看到中断中美教育交流的严重情况的发生。
