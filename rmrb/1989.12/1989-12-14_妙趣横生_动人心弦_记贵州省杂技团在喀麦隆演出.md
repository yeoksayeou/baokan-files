The Guizhou Provincial Acrobatic Troupe's performance in Cameroon was hailed as a delightful and heart-stirring experience. The troupe's artistic prowess captivated audiences, leaving them in awe of the beauty, humor, and ingenuity of Chinese acrobatics. The Minister of News and Culture of Cameroon, Henri Bondolo, was particularly impressed, stating, "Your acrobatics are beautiful, witty, and very humorous. It has been many years since I have seen such a splendid performance. The performers are all very young, indicating that Chinese acrobatics have a bright future. Their successful performance proves that Chinese acrobatics remain the best in the world."

On the evening of November 14, the conference hall at the top of a hill in Yaoundé, built with aid from China, was brightly lit and filled to capacity. The Guizhou Provincial Acrobatic Troupe's first performance in Cameroon drew over 1,500 spectators, including ministers, secretaries of state, legislators from Cameroon, and numerous diplomatic envoys. The enchanting music and exquisite performances provided a profound artistic experience. A Cameroonian official who had visited China remarked joyfully, "Tonight, I feel as if I have returned to the great land of China."

The troupe presented over twenty acts, performed by just sixteen talented artists, each versatile and skilled in multiple disciplines. The repertoire included both traditional acts like "Tightrope Walking" and "Pole Climbing," as well as innovative performances such as "Double Barrel" and "Rolling Lanterns." The performers' movements were precise and fluid, and their stage presence was both natural and elegant. After each act, the audience erupted in enthusiastic applause and cheers. During the more thrilling segments, the hall fell silent, with spectators holding their breath in anticipation. When the humor took center stage, the audience burst into laughter.

The "Double Barrel" act featured twin brothers, Long Jun and Long Bing, both twenty years old. Their agile and supple bodies moved effortlessly in and out of barrels with a diameter of less than fifty centimeters, creating a delightful spectacle. This act had previously won the "Gold K Award" at the Second World Youth Acrobatics Festival in Monaco. Song Chaohui's "Card Tricks" were as mesmerizing as a celestial flower scattering petals, leaving the audience dazzled. Yang Wenhua balanced, held, and kicked five candelabras, each with ten lit candles, in a breathtaking display of skill and grace.

To fulfill the cultural exchange agreement between China and African nations, the Guizhou Provincial Acrobatic Troupe will tour seven African countries. Before arriving in Cameroon, they had already performed sixteen shows in Rwanda and Zaire, receiving overwhelming success. Following their performances in Cameroon, the troupe will travel to Benin and Chad. Throughout their two-month African tour, the troupe demonstrated unwavering determination, unity, and a spirit of resilience, all in the name of national pride. The troupe leader, Ding Jie, shared with reporters that to prepare for this African tour, in July, they had performed over seventy shows in the scorching heat of Wuhan, where temperatures reached forty degrees Celsius. This rigorous training ensured that the performers could endure the African heat.

In addition to their performances in Yaoundé, the troupe also visited Douala, Cameroon's economic hub, for a series of performances. The African people have a deep affection for Chinese acrobatics, and in the garden of Sino-African friendship, it is a flower that never fades.

    妙趣横生　动人心弦
    ——记贵州省杂技团在喀麦隆演出
    本报记者　杨汝生
    “你们的杂技很美，风趣，也很幽默，好多年没有看过这么精彩的演出了。演员们都很年轻，说明中国杂技后继有人。他们的成功表演证明中国杂技仍然是世界上最好的”。喀麦隆新闻和文化部长亨利·邦多洛在观看完贵州省杂技团演出之后，这样赞不绝口地说。
    十一月十四日晚，由我国援建的位于雅温得市一山巅的会议大厦灯火辉煌，座无虚席，热闹非凡。贵州省杂技团在此举行访问喀麦隆的首场演出，这支来自东方的艺术奇葩吸引了一千五百余名观众。他们中有喀麦隆的部长、国务秘书、议员，还有许多驻此的外交使节。美妙的乐曲和精湛的演技使人们得到莫大的艺术享受。一位曾经访问过我国的喀麦隆官员高兴地说：“今天晚上，我好像又回到了伟大的中国”。
    贵州杂技团这次共带来二十余个节目，只有十六名演员，队伍比较精干，人人都是一专多能。所演节目既有传统的，如“走钢丝”、“扛杆”；也有创新的，如“双人钻桶”、“滚灯”。演员们动作干净利索，表演自然大方。每当演完一个节目，全场都爆发出热烈的掌声和喝彩声。演到惊险处，场内鸦雀无声，观众们都屏息观看；演到滑稽处，人们情不自禁地发出一阵阵哄笑。表演“双人钻桶”的演员是一对双胞胎，哥哥叫龙军，弟弟叫龙兵，今年二十岁。他们轻捷柔软的身躯好像两条泥鳅在两个直径不到五十厘米的桶里钻来钻去，十分有趣。这个节目去年曾在摩纳哥举行的第二届世界青少年杂技节上获“金K奖”。宋朝晖表演的“牌技”如天女散花，令人眼花缭乱。杨文华头顶、手托、足蹬五个烛台，上面共有五十支点燃的蜡烛，翻卷自如，美妙无比。
    为了履行我国与非洲国家间的文化交流协定，贵州省杂技团将在七个黑非洲国家进行巡回演出。来喀麦隆之前，他们已经在卢旺达和扎伊尔演出了十六场，获得极大的成功。在喀演出之后，杂技团将赴贝宁、乍得。在长达两个多月的非洲之行中，全团同志表现了不怕艰难、团结互助、奋力拚搏、为国争光的精神。团长丁杰同志告诉记者，为了准备这次非洲之行，今年七月，他们曾把这支队伍拉到“火炉”武汉，冒着四十摄氏度的高温，演出七十余场，以使演员能适应非洲的炎热。
    除在雅温得演出之外，杂技团还在喀“经济首都”杜阿拉访问演出。非洲人民非常喜爱中国杂技，在中非友好的百花园里，它是一束永不凋谢的小花。（附图片）
