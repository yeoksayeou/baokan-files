The seventh session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress today continued its group discussions. The committee members reviewed the draft of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Military Installations and the draft of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Urban Planning.

Many committee members pointed out that protecting military installations is of great significance. They suggested that nationwide propaganda and education should be carried out to raise the national defense consciousness of the people, actively promote the support of the military and love for the people, and strengthen military-civilian relations. Various levels of people's congresses and governments should also pay attention to the propaganda and education work of the Law on the Protection of Military Installations.

When reviewing the draft of the Urban Planning Law, the committee members generally believed that the draft, after revision, is relatively mature and basically feasible. At the same time, they proposed some revision opinions.

Some committee members advocated that the scale of large and medium-sized cities should be strictly controlled. The Urban Planning Law should have a regulation on how large a city should be developed. Considering the national strength, production, and living standards, the scale of Chinese cities should not be too large; otherwise, it will cause huge public hazards such as noise, pollution, and traffic congestion. Some industrial and mining enterprises should not be built in cities.

Many committee members suggested that urban planning should be comprehensively considered and coordinated. Urban planning should consider both new city construction and the expansion and renovation of old cities, as well as both surface construction and underground facilities.

Some committee members pointed out that the current irrational layout of cities urgently needs to be adjusted. When making urban plans, both short-term and long-term considerations should be combined. It should be clear which cities are cultural cities, which are industrial cities, and which are comprehensive cities. There should be a clear urban planning concept.

    人大常委会议继续分组讨论
    认为保护军事设施非常重要城市规模不宜过大
    据新华社北京12月22日电　（记者张宿堂）七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议今天继续分组讨论，委员们分别审议了中华人民共和国军事设施保护法草案和中华人民共和国城市规划法草案。
    许多委员提出，对军事设施的保护具有重要意义，应当在全国范围进行广泛的宣传和教育，提高全民的国防观念，大力开展拥军爱民活动，密切军民关系。各级人大和政府更要重视军事设施保护法的宣传教育工作。
    在审议城市规划法草案时，委员们普遍认为，草案经过修改已比较成熟，基本可行。同时提出了一些修改意见。
    一些委员主张，应严格控制大、中城市的规模，对一个城市的发展应控制在多大规模之内，城市规划法应有个规定，限于国力、生产、生活水平，我国城市规模不宜发展过大，否则会产生巨大公害，如噪声、污染、交通拥挤等。有些工矿企业不宜建在城市。
    许多委员提出，城市规划要全面考虑统筹安排。城市规划，既要考虑新城市建设，又要考虑老城市的扩建和改造，既要考虑地面建设，还要考虑地下设施。
    有的委员提出，现有城市布局不合理的状况亟需调整。在做城市规划时，近期的和长远的要综合考虑。哪些是文化城市，哪些是工业城市，哪些是综合性城市，都应有明确的城市规划思想。
