The Asian Games stir the hearts of tea farmers, ten baskets of fragrant tea sent to Beijing. The Daduhe Tea Plantation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, has donated seven types of high-quality tea, including Longshan Yunhao and premium jasmine tea, totaling ten baskets, to the 11th Asian Games. Today, workers from the Daduhe Tea Plantation, along with Beijing sent-down youth who once worked in the border areas of Yunnan, and colleagues from the Huasheng News Agency and the Asian Games fundraising department, held a reporting meeting to share their experiences of contributing to the Asian Games.

The Daduhe Tea Plantation, located on the border of Yunnan, has been closely following the preparations for the 11th Asian Games. They believe that the Asian Games are not just a competition for athletes but also a bridge connecting the people of China and various countries and regions in Asia. They want to offer the best tea from China to the athletes and friends. The entire workforce has meticulously selected seven types of high-quality tea as the signature products for the Asian Games.
