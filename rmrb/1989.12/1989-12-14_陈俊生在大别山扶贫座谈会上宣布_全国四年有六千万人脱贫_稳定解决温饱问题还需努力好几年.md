Chen Junsheng, State Councillor and Director of the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas, pointed out today in Nanyang that after four years of arduous efforts, China's poverty-stricken areas have begun to show signs of improvement, and most regions have initially resolved the food problem. However, the poverty issue remains severe, and the task of poverty alleviation in the 1990s will still be very arduous.

At the Fourth Dabie Mountains Poverty Alleviation and Development Symposium, Chen Junsheng pointed out: Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council began to focus on the economic development of China's poverty-stricken areas in 1985, by the end of 1988, the number of impoverished people with an annual per capita net income of less than 200 yuan had been reduced by approximately 60 million. The proportion of impoverished people in the national rural population had decreased from the original 12.3% to 5.3%. The number of impoverished counties with an annual per capita income of less than 150 yuan had decreased from the original 83 to 8. The food problem for the people in the concentrated and contiguous poverty-stricken areas in the central and eastern regions, such as the Yimeng Mountains, Dabie Mountains, Taihang Mountains, and Min-Yue Mountains, had been basically resolved. Nationwide, 55.3% of the impoverished counties had an annual per capita income exceeding 300 yuan. The situation this year continues to show a stable improvement trend. Overall, in the past few years, the annual progress in resolving the food problem has been approximately 15% to 20%. At this rate, it is entirely possible to complete the task set by the State Council for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period to basically resolve the food problem for the majority of the people in poverty-stricken areas by the end of 1990.

However, Chen Junsheng particularly pointed out that the remaining approximately 10% of impoverished households that have not resolved the food problem are mostly concentrated in the more challenging deep mountain and high-altitude regions, and the difficulty of stably resolving the food problem for these people is significant. Some impoverished households that have initially resolved the food problem are also quite unstable, and in years of poor harvests, they can easily face problems again, resulting in a high rate of returning to poverty. To stably resolve the food problem for the people in China's poverty-stricken areas, several more years of effort are needed. Moreover, resolving the food problem does not mean escaping poverty. Although China's poverty-stricken areas have shown signs of improvement in recent years, from the perspective of achieving a moderately prosperous society and overall, they are still impoverished. The absolute gap between the per capita income of farmers in poverty-stricken areas and the national average continues to widen.

He said that in the future, China's poverty alleviation work will have two main tasks: on one hand, to launch a decisive battle to resolve the food problem in the most challenging poverty-stricken areas, and on the other hand, in those poverty-stricken areas where the food problem has been basically resolved, to seize the opportunity to gradually transition to a new stage of economic development aimed at escaping poverty and becoming prosperous. The goal is to enable the majority of poverty-stricken areas to fully and stably resolve the food problem and for most households to live a comfortable life.

Chen Junsheng emphasized that in the next three years of rectification and reform, poverty alleviation work must achieve new developments and new situations. The current state of poverty-stricken areas cannot remain the same after three years of rectification and reform.

Addressing concerns and doubts raised by representatives from key national poverty-stricken areas regarding the continuity of current poverty alleviation policies, Chen Junsheng clearly announced: The series of poverty alleviation policies formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council in recent years will remain unchanged. The funds and materials will not be reduced because of the achievements in poverty alleviation. The income from technology personnel engaged in poverty alleviation contracts is legal and legitimate. The development-oriented economic entities involved in scientific and technological poverty alleviation should be protected and supported. The practice of national ministries and commissions supporting poverty-stricken areas through pairing and designated points will also remain unchanged.

    陈俊生在大别山扶贫座谈会上宣布
    全国四年有六千万人脱贫
    稳定解决温饱问题还需努力好几年
    本报南阳12月13日电　记者谢联辉、陈健报道：国务委员兼国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组组长陈俊生今天在此间指出：经过4年的艰苦努力，我国贫困地区开始出现转机，大多数地区已趋于初步解决温饱，但贫困问题依然严重，90年代我国贫困地区的扶贫任务仍然十分艰巨。
    在第四次大别山扶贫开发座谈会上，陈俊生指出：自从1985年党中央、国务院下大力气抓我国贫困地区的经济开发工作以来，到1988年底，全国人均年纯收入在200元以下的贫困人口已减少了6000万人左右，全国农村人口中贫困人口所占的比重也由原来的12.3％下降到5.3％；年人均纯收入在150元以下的贫困县也由原来的83个降至8个；地处中东部地区的沂蒙山区、大别山区、太行山区、闽粤山区等集中连片的贫困地区群众的温饱问题已经基本解决；全国已有55.3％的贫困县人均年收入超过了300元。今年的情况仍是稳步好转趋势。综合来看，这几年全国每年解决温饱问题的进度大约在15％—20％之间。照这样的速度，到1990年底，完成国务院提出的“七五”期间基本解决大多数贫困地区人民的温饱问题的任务是完全可能的。
    但是，陈俊生特别指出，目前剩下的大约10％左右的温饱问题没有解决的贫困户，大多集中分布在条件较差的深山和高寒地区，稳定地解决这部分人的温饱问题的难度很大。一些初步解决温饱问题的贫困户也很不稳定，遇上不顺的年景又很容易出现问题，返贫率较高。要稳定地解决我国贫困地区人民的温饱问题，还需要付出好几年的努力。另外，解决温饱也并不等于摆脱贫困，虽然这几年我国贫困地区已出现了转机，但从小康的目标和整体上讲依然是贫困的，贫困地区农民与全国平均的人均收入水平的绝对差距仍在扩大。
    他说，今后我国扶贫工作的总任务是，一方面打好解决那些条件很差的贫困地区温饱问题的攻坚战，另一方面在那些基本解决温饱的贫困地区又应不失时机地逐步转向以脱贫致富为目标的经济开发新阶段上来。要使多数贫困地区做到：全面稳定地解决温饱，多数户过上宽裕生活。
    陈俊生强调，在今后3年的治理整顿中，扶贫工作必须有个新的发展，新的局面，不能3年治理整顿后贫困地区还是现在这个样子。
    针对来自全国重点贫困地区的一些代表对当前扶贫政策的连续性等提出的担心和疑虑，陈俊生明确宣布：近年来党中央、国务院制订的一系列扶贫政策继续保持不变；各项资金和物资不会因为扶贫出了成绩而减少；科技人员搞扶贫承包的收入是合法正当的；清理整顿公司对科技扶贫的开发性经济实体应加以保护和支持；国家机关部委挂钩定点支持贫困地区的做法也不会变。
