What? You want to write about me? Don't be silly, I don't have any outstanding achievements to write about. If you want to write, write about someone else! Like Shi Guirong, she's a great material for you "scholars" to write about. She was the first to attend the East Coal Company's family advanced model commendation meeting in the Da Lu mining area. No? Then write about Yan Wenxiu, a 63-year-old woman who still helps the workers wash and mend their clothes at the mine entrance. Still no? Then write about Li Guilan, Hu Guirong, Dai Yuexia... Why do you insist on writing about me? Because I'm going to attend the East Coal Company's model family experience exchange meeting in a few days? Ask me how I got together with Ziming? How I helped Ziming? I'll pass, "scholar"! Okay, I can't argue with you. Let me tell you, this isn't an outstanding achievement, you mustn't write it down. I'll just casually tell you a few things, you have to put down your pen first. This is just ordinary people's talk, it can't be put on paper.

I met Ziming in 1974 through an introduction. Ziming? You "little scholar" are funny. Ziming is my husband, you should call him big brother. You're asking about his position? What position? He's a worker. He's the deputy team leader of the 705 team in the Da Lu mining area of the Henggang Mining Bureau. His position as deputy team leader? Half of it is my credit. You don't believe me? Then go to the 705 team and ask my big brother and the workers there. Look at me, I'll start from the beginning.

That year, I was introduced to Wang Ziming. It was the middle of winter, and the snow was flying. I will never forget my first visit to Ziming's home. As soon as I entered his house, my heart, which was burning with enthusiasm, was doused with a bucket of cold water. Inside the house, there was an uneven floor with a table on it, a thermos with a broken bamboo cover, and two chipped ceramic bowls placed upside down on the table. On the kang (a traditional heated bed), there were two unsewn quilts, and at the head of the kang lay Ziming's father, who was suffering from late-stage lung cancer and moaning. His younger brother and sister were looking at me from different corners, their eyes filled with fear and anxiety. Although the introducer had told me about Ziming's family situation beforehand—three generations and ten people in the family—but I never imagined it would be like this. My heart felt a strange, indescribable sensation. How to put it? Other girls and sisters were looking for partners with official parents or wealthy relatives, but my heart was like having twenty-five cats in my arms—it was scratching at my heart! I casually exchanged a few words and turned to leave, but the introducer saw me and hurriedly followed me out, repeatedly telling me how good Ziming's heart was, how honest and hardworking he was, and so on. I returned home in a daze. My parents asked me how it went, and I didn't say a word. My parents thought I didn't agree, so they started arranging another introduction for me. I lay in bed, unable to sleep, tossing and turning with thoughts. In terms of conditions, Ziming's family was indeed not well-off. Ziming was the eldest son, and his father had late-stage lung cancer, borrowing over 2,000 yuan just for hospital treatment. Marrying into such a family was like jumping into a fire pit. Moreover, my sisters often compared themselves to others when looking for partners. If they found someone like Ziming, my sisters would laugh at me behind my back, and my parents would agree? But Ziming's sincere gaze attracted me, especially his father's moans on the kang shook my heartstrings. Yes, we are young, why always look at things with worldly eyes? Shouldn't we sacrifice a little for others to gain our own happiness? I deeply felt that Ziming's family needed me. My thoughts gradually leaned towards the latter. Without telling my parents, I met Ziming a few more times. Through our conversations, I saw that Ziming was sincere, kind, and simple. When I told my parents that I wanted to continue seeing Ziming, my parents, sisters, and brothers immediately erupted like a camp under siege, all shouting at me, calling me "crazy" and "foolish." One after another, they fired "machine guns" at me, but I covered my ears and didn't listen to anyone, determined to be with Ziming. In early 1975, I married Ziming. What's the big deal about marriage? There was nothing. The wedding cost less than 300 yuan. Do I regret it? No. Once I make up my mind, not even three oxen can pull me back. Good days aren't enjoyed, they are earned with sweat and struggle. Right, "scholar"?

I married Ziming, but who would have thought that less than two months after our wedding, Ziming's father passed away. During the time Ziming's father was in the hospital, we borrowed over 2,000 yuan for his treatment. After we got married, we had to take care of the elderly and the young, and the entire burden fell on Ziming and me. At that time, Ziming earned less than 90 yuan a month, 90 yuan for a family of ten, and 2,000 yuan in debt, how could we live? Ziming was a bit overwhelmed, he was anxious, and his mouth was full of blisters. I wished I could pay off the debt all at once, and the family could live a carefree and happy life like others, but the most important thing at the moment was to take good care of Ziming, he was the pillar of the family. Seeing Ziming's body gradually becoming thinner due to overwork and worry, I comforted and encouraged him. While taking care of the elderly, I almost took on all the household chores. To ensure Ziming could rest well after work and work safely underground, this housewife took on half the responsibilities of a "man." Chopping wood, carrying water, buying grain, not to mention digging the kang and cleaning the chimney, these were all men's jobs that I did. I won't go into details, but let me talk about carrying water. A few years ago, we had to carry water from five miles away, and the path was full of ditches and bumps, high and low, even young men found it troublesome. I had never carried water at home, and when I first carried water, I used a handkerchief to pad my shoulder, gritted my teeth, and carried a full load. I couldn't walk two steps without my shoulder shaking, as if it would fall off. I staggered and couldn't walk four or five steps without spilling half the water. I was so angry, I really wanted to have a good cry. At home, I had never suffered like this. However, I have a stubborn temper, the more others worry about it, the more I am determined to do it. The first load of water took an hour, and when I got home, only a third of it was left. I was so tired that I was panting. My younger brother wanted to help me carry water, but I refused. The second load of water, I sweated like beads rolling down my face, I gritted my teeth and counted for myself, resting every hundred steps, and when I got home, I rested over fifty times, carrying back two-thirds of the water. I went to carry the third load, but my mother-in-law, younger brother, and sister-in-law wouldn't let me go. I insisted on carrying another load. Fortunately, the result was not bad, I carried back four-fifths of the water. That night, my body was soft and weak. Ziming came home from work and scolded me, but I said, "It's okay, I'm not made of clay." Ziming helped me uncover my shoulder, and I saw purple-red bruises, my shoulder was sore, numb, and stiff, and my right shoulder felt like it would fall off. However, the next day I carried water again, and the third day, I finally managed to carry a full load of water home. That night, my shoulder was a bright red. Now it's fine, we have running water at home, and we don't need to carry water anymore. You know, carrying water really trains your body and willpower. Besides, at that time, my younger brother and sister were not yet thirteen or fourteen, who else would carry water?

To help Ziming pay off the debt as soon as possible, I took my younger brother and sister to the mountains and opened up two mu of land. We would leave before dawn and return late at night, digging the earth, plowing the fields, and planting potatoes, beans, and cabbages. This way, we didn't need to buy vegetables in the summer and autumn, and we had vegetables to eat in the winter. Seeing the green vegetables growing from the sweat we shed, my heart was truly happy. This is what people say, "one drop of sweat, one drop of harvest."

To help Ziming take care of his body, I specially raised a dozen hens. The eggs laid by the hens were for Ziming and the elderly in the family to eat, and we women ate steamed buns. Miners' families know: nine out of ten miners have stomach problems. I saved all the flour and rice for Ziming to make different dishes, and I would have the meals ready before he came home from work. If he came home late, the meals might be reheated many times. Ziming worked so hard, how could he manage without some nutritious food? We women can endure some hardship, and the tight days will slowly ease.

Ziming's progress has a part of my credit, don't say that. This is the result of the organization trusting him and his comrades helping him. But to be honest, I've put a lot of effort into Ziming. A miner's wife, if she doesn't share the same breath and fate with the miner, she's not a miner's wife! Ziming works hard, he's diligent and hardworking, like a yellow ox, he takes on the dirtiest, hardest, and most dangerous jobs. Even after becoming the team leader, his work style hasn't changed. The workers respect his spirit. Ziming has one bad habit, he likes to ride the elevator when it's full, which is against safety regulations. I remember in December 1977, Ziming was on the night shift, and it was already past 8 PM, but he hadn't come home. You know, being a miner's wife is not easy, when your husband doesn't come home at the end of his shift, your heart tightens, always thinking the worst. Although our mine's safety has improved, when the end of the shift comes and he doesn't come home, it makes you anxious. After putting the children to sleep, I put on my coat, braved the heavy snow, and went to find Ziming, my heart pounding like a little drum. When I arrived at Ziming's shift, I found out: Ziming was detained by the team leader for riding the elevator. Hearing about riding the elevator, my heart, which had just calmed down, was raised to my throat again. I pushed open the office door in three steps. The team secretary saw me and smiled, handing Ziming over to me, telling me to go home and talk to him. When I got home, I asked Ziming, "The leader said you often ride the elevator, why?" He said, "I'm tired from work, sometimes the elevator is full, and I don't want to wait." Seeing that I was angry, Ziming comforted me, "Don't worry, I'm good at riding the elevator, there are still ten or so others." Hearing Ziming say this, I was so angry that tears welled up in my eyes. After thinking for a while, I said to Ziming, "Tomorrow after work, invite all your elevator-riding 'friends' to come over, and say I'm treating them to a drink." The next evening, Ziming invited a few of his elevator-riding friends to our home. Before they arrived, I had already set up the wine and dishes. A few workers saw the wine and wanted to drink, but I stopped them. I asked them, "Do you know why I'm treating you to a drink today?" "Sister-in-law is..." They looked at me in confusion, and I said in a bad mood, "Today, I'm celebrating the heroes of riding the elevator." They were stunned for a while, and I said to Ziming, "Ziming, your friends are all here today, I have a question for you, from now on, can you stop riding the elevator? If you agree not to ride the elevator, drink this cup of wine, if you don't agree, we..." Ziming lowered his head, and I said to them, "I'll say a few words from the heart to you, Ziming is the big brother among you, and he's the group leader, he sets the example by riding the elevator, and you follow him. Have you thought about what would happen if something went wrong? One person's accident brings disaster to the whole family, the whole team, the whole area, and the whole mine suffers." The brothers heard this and, clicking their tongues, said to Ziming, "Big brother, sister-in-law is right, today, for sister-in-law's kindness, we brothers won't ride the elevator anymore. Big brother, you're the group leader, you set the example, and we brothers will supervise each other." I heard that there was a way, and I kept saying, "Good, a man's word is his bond," and the brothers picked up my words, "four horses can't pull it back." After that, I went to the mine every few days to inquire and check, three months passed, and Ziming didn't ride the elevator once. Once I went to the mine, the team secretary tightly held my hand and asked, "What good method did you use, not only did you control Ziming, but the 'elevator king' of the team also improved."

In 1987, the team held an election for the team leader. Ziming was elected as the deputy team leader because of his diligent work and experience. Ziming's education is low, he can't recognize a single character, whether it's roll call before the shift, recording work points, or teaching children at home, he made many funny mistakes. Once, the young workers in the team were discussing the Mexican TV series "Bianka," and a young worker wrote these two characters for Ziming, asking him how to pronounce them. Ziming thought for a long time and pronounced it "Kaka," making everyone in the room laugh so hard their stomachs hurt. I thought: if Ziming wants to be a good team leader, I should first help him overcome the "cultural barrier." Although I only graduated from junior high school, I can read newspapers and write letters better than him. So, every time Ziming was off work or had free time, I taught him characters starting from "人、口、手、刀、木、工." I taught him about 600-700 characters, tested him every day, taught him to read the names of all the team members, taught him to write work sheets, and also taught him the commonly used characters underground like "锹、楔、腿、架、梁." Now Ziming can write letters.

I am a safety inspector, and every year I go to the mine for safety inspections for over a hundred days, serving both as a security guard and a safety inspector. Xu Yuefa's wife died in 1978, leaving behind three boys. At that time, the eldest was 7 years old, and the youngest was only 3 years old. Xu Yuefa couldn't even go to work, let alone take care of three children in a day. We few family members, in order to let him work in peace, actively went to his home to clean, wash bedding, scrub walls, and paper the ceiling. The originally uninhabitable house was cleaned up by us and looked brand new. Later, we actively took over Xu Yuefa's family, taking turns to take care of his home and children. During the New Year, we donated money and made dumplings for his family; in winter, we made cotton clothes and quilts, and in summer, we made single-layer clothes; when the children were sick, we took them to the hospital for injections; when the children reached school age, we picked them up and sent them to school until the youngest child was in the third grade. Xu Yuefa was so moved that he often had tears in his eyes, and on the first day of the New Year, he sent a letter of thanks to the miners' union and the mine party committee.

What? You're writing again. Let me tell you, don't write about me, I'm too ordinary. Finally, let me say, write well about other miners' mothers and wives. Goodbye, "little scholar."

"The world is made up of ordinary and mundane things." So, I still wrote about her. Her name is Liu Jinrong, she is 36 years old. She is of medium height, has short hair, and a reddish-brown face. She is a miner's wife in the Henggang Mining Bureau's Da Lu Coal Mine, one of the countless miners' wives.

    矿工的妻子
    李贺锋
    什么，你要写我？别逗了，我可没有什么先进事迹可写。要写，你写写别人吧！像史桂英，写写她准行，她可是你们“秀才”写的大材料，她是咱大陆矿开拓区第一个出席东煤公司家属先进标兵表彰会的。不行？那你再写阎文秀，63岁的老太太了，还和我们年轻媳妇一样到矿井口拆洗被褥，为工人缝补作业服。也不行？那你写写李桂兰、胡桂英、戴月霞她们……怎么，偏偏要写我？因为我过两天参加东煤公司模范家属经验交流会？问我是怎样同子明结合的？怎样帮助子明的？我说免了吧，“秀才”！好，真磨不过你。告诉你，我这可不是先进事迹，你千万不要记，我随随便便给你说两句，你得先放下笔。这是老百姓的话，上不了纸面儿的。
    一我和子明是1974年经人介绍认识的。子明是谁，你这“小秀才”真逗。子明是我丈夫，你叫大哥。你是问职务？什么职不职、务不务的，工人。咱鹤岗矿务局大陆矿开拓区705队的副队长。他这个副队长吗，一半是我的功劳。怎么，你不信，那你哪天去705队问问你大哥和队里的工人。你看我这个人……咱把话从头来讲起吧。
    那年初，经人介绍，我与王子明认识了。当时正是大雪飘飞的隆冬季节，我第一次到子明家的情景一辈子也忘不了。一进子明的家中，我那颗热火火的心便被一盆凉水浇灭了。一进屋，不平的地上摆着地桌，地桌上放着破竹皮的暖瓶，两个掉了漆的瓷缸倒放在桌面上。炕上堆放着两床脱了套的棉被，炕头上躺着身患肺癌正哼哼的子明父亲。小弟、小妹们东一个、西一个偷偷看我，眼神中不时露出惶恐不安的神色。虽然介绍人在此之前就给我介绍子明的经济条件：家中老少三辈10口人，但我怎么也不会想到是这种情形。我的心真有一种说不出、道不明的滋味。怎么说呢，别人家的姑娘姐妹找对象都找父母当官的，亲戚有钱的，我的心当时真是25只猫抱在怀里——百爪搔心呐！我简单地应酬了几句扭身就往外走，介绍人一看急了，急忙跟了出来，一个劲向我介绍子明这个人心眼如何好，为人如何老实，工作如何能干等等。我脑子昏昏回到了家。父母问我怎么样，我没吭声。父母以为我不同意，就张罗再给我介绍对象。我一个人躺在床上睡不好觉，翻来覆去想心事。论条件，子明家的经济条件确实不好，子明是家中的长子，子明父亲患的是晚期肺癌，光住院治疗就借了2000多元，进这样的人家无疑是往火坑里跳。再一则，姐妹们平常找对象互相比，找子明这样条件的，姐妹们背地笑话不说，父母能同意吗？但子明恳切的目光把我吸引住了，尤其是子明父亲躺在炕上的呻吟声把我的心弦震颤了。是啊，我们是青年人，为什么总用世俗的眼光去看待事，难道不应当为别人牺牲一些而取得自己的幸福吗？我深深地感到了子明一家需要我。我的思想慢慢地倾向了后一种。我背着父母又同子明见了两面，通过两个人的交谈，我看出了子明诚恳、厚道、朴实。当我把同子明继续处下去的意见告诉父母后，父母，姐妹，兄弟立即炸了营似地，纷纷说我“痴了”“傻子”，你一句，我一句向我打起了“机关枪”，我一捂耳朵，谁的话也不听，铁了心跟子明。1975年初，我与子明结了婚。结婚有什么东西？什么东西也没有。结婚花了不到三百元。问我后悔不，不后悔。我这个人认定的事几头老牛也拉不回。好日子不是享受来的，是用汗水和奋斗换来的。这话对吧，“秀才”。
    二我和子明结婚了。可谁知道，我们结婚不到两个月，子明的父亲就去世了。在子明父亲有病住院期间，为给老人治病，借了2000多元的外债。我们结婚后，对上孝敬老人，对下照顾弟弟、妹妹，全副担子落在了我和子明的肩上。子明那时一个月开不到90元工资，90元钱，全家10口人，2000元的外债，日子可怎么过呀？子明有些受不了了，他着急，上火，满嘴起了大泡。我是恨不得一下子就把债都还上，家里也像别人家一样无忧无虑过快快乐乐的日子，但当前最主要的是照顾好子明，他是全家的顶梁柱啊。望着子明由于劳累、思虑，身体渐渐消瘦下去，我安慰他、劝他，在照顾好老人的同时，我几乎承担了子明在家的全部活儿。为了让子明下班后休息好，到井下安安全全生产，我这个家庭妇女顶起了半个“男子汉”。劈柴、挑水、买粮不说，甚至扒炕、掏火墙这些爷们儿干的活儿我也干。别的不说，就说挑水。前几年我们那儿挑一担水，往返得走五里多路，路儿沟沟坎坎，高低不平，连大小伙子都犯愁。我在家根本没挑过水，刚挑水时用手巾垫在肩上，咬着牙挑了满满一担，走不了两步，压得肩膀直打晃，好像肩膀要掉下来似的，摇摇晃晃走不了四、五步，水桶的水洒了一多半。我这个气啊，真想好好哭上一场，在家哪遭过这份罪啊。不过，我这个人就是这么个犟脾气，别人愈犯愁的事，只要我认准了一定干到底。第一担水用了一个小时，挑到家只剩下了1／3，累得呼哧哧直喘。小叔子要帮我挑，我说什么也不干。挑第二担水，一路上豆粒大的汗珠直滚，我咬着牙，给自己数着数，每一百步歇一歇，到家歇了五十多歇，一担水挑回了2／3。我又去挑第三担，家里的婆婆、小叔子、小姑子说什么也不让我去了，我硬是又挑了一担。还好，成绩不小，挑回家歇了三十多歇，一担水挑回了4／5。晚上睡觉，身子软绵绵的。子明下班后知道了责怪我，我说：“没事，又不是泥捏的。”子明替我扒开肩头，只见肩上压出了紫红色的淤血，肩膀又酸、又木、又麻，右肩膀像掉下来似的。不过，第二天我又挑了水，第三天，我终于能完完全全把一担水挑回了家。晚上肩膀一片殷红。现在好了，我们那儿安上了自来水，不用挑水了。你别说，挑水真锻炼人的身体和意志，再说，当时小叔子、小姑子都不到十三、四岁，我不挑谁挑。
      为了帮子明早还上欠债，我领着小叔子、小姑子上山开了两亩地。早晨天不亮就走，晚上夜深了才回来，一锹锹挖地、刨垄、耕种，种上了土豆、豆角、白菜，这样夏、秋两季不用买菜，冬天也有了过冬的菜。鼻闻眼见自己洒下汗水而成长起来的绿油油的菜，心中真是高兴，这也是人们所说的“一份辛苦，一份收获”吧。
    为了让子明保养身体，我特意养了十几只母鸡。母鸡下的蛋供子明和家里的老人吃，我们娘几个吃窝窝头。矿工的亲人都知道：十个矿工九个有胃病。我把有数的白面、大米都攒起来给子明变样做，在他下班前把饭菜做好，下班晚了饭菜也说不定热上多少次。子明上班那么累，再没有点营养的东西跟着怎么行？宁可我们娘几个吃点苦，让紧日子慢慢松下来就好了。什么，债？现在我们的债早还上了，子明一个月的工资就开200多元，再加上奖金钱，哪个月也开300多元。今年咱矿改革承包，生产形势又好，每个月光得奖就得百八十元。有没有储蓄？有，银行里存了三、五千元。咱现在还不太富裕，富日子也得当紧日子过呀，手头没点积蓄还行。
    三子明的进步有我的一份功劳，别这么说，这是组织上信任他，同志们帮助他的结果。但话说回来，我在子明身上也没少费力。矿工的妻子嘛，不和矿工同呼吸共命运还叫矿工的妻子！子明干起活来是没说的，工作吃苦耐劳，像头黄牛似的，脏活，累活，险活他抢着干，就是当了队长这种作风也没改。工人们服他这个劲。子明也有一个毛病，就是升井好登车，这是违反安全规章的。记得1977年12月的一天，子明上大班，都已经晚上8点多钟了，我把饭菜热了好几次，可子明还没回来。你知道，当矿工的妻子不容易，丈夫到了下班时间没回来，这心里就揪紧了，总往坏处想。虽然咱矿安全大见好转，但真的下班时间人不回来，把人急的什么似的。我把孩子哄睡后，披上了大衣，顶着漫天飞雪，一步一滑地去找子明，心像小鼓咚咚响跳个不停。待我一到子明班上一问才明白：子明因登车被队领导留下了。听到登车，我刚放下的心又提到了嗓子眼，我三步并作两步推开了办公室的门。队里书记见我来了，笑着把子明交给了我，叫我回去好好开导开导他。到家后我问子明
  “领导说你常登车，究竟为啥？”他说：“干活累，有时车里人满，不愿意等。”见我生气了，子明安慰我道：
  “别担心，我登车水平高，别人还有十来个呢。”听子明这么一说，气得我眼泪在眼圈里转，想了半晌，我对子明说：“明天下班把你那些登车的‘好朋友’都找来，就说我请他们喝酒。”第二天晚上，子明把几个登车的哥们儿找到了家，我在他们来之前就把酒菜摆上，几名工人见酒就要喝，被我拦住了。我问他们：“你们知道嫂子今天为什么请你们喝酒？”“嫂子是……”他们哥儿几个不解地望着我，我没好气道：“今天嫂子是给你们登车的英雄庆功的。”他们愣了半晌，我对子明道：“子明，今天你的哥们都来了，我问你一句话，从今往后，能不能不登车？答应不登车，把这杯酒喝了，不答应，咱们……”子明低下了头，我对他们哥几个说：“嫂子说几句知心话给你们听，子明在你们当中是大哥，又是组长，他带头登车，你们跟着他学，你们想到没有，万一有个闪失，你们的父母、妻子、兄妹怎么办？一人出事全家遭难，全队、全区、全矿跟着遭殃。”哥儿几个一听这话，一边吧嗒嘴一边对子明道：“大哥，嫂子讲得对，今天冲着嫂子这份心思我们哥们儿以后绝不登车了。大哥，你是组长，你带个头，以后咱们哥几个互相监督。”我一听有门，连声叫“好，男子汉一言出口”，哥儿几个接过我的话头“驷马难追”。以后我三天两头去班上打听、查看，三个月的时间过去了，子明没登一次车。一次我到矿上，队里书记紧握我的手连声问：“你用了什么好法子，不光管住了子明，队里的‘登车大王’也学好了。”
    1987年，队里改选队长。子明由于工作勤恳又有经验，被大伙选上了副队长。子明文化低，斗大的字识不了一口袋，不论是班前点名还是记工分，或是在家教孩子识字，闹出了许多笑话。有一次，队里的青年工人议论着墨西哥电视剧《卞卡》，一青年工人把这两个字写给子明，问子明这两个字怎么念，子明想了半天，念成了“卡卡”，把屋里的人肚子都笑痛了。我想：子明要想当好队长，首先要帮他闯过“文化关”。虽然我只是初中毕业生，可读个报纸，写个信总比他强。于是每当子明下班、闲班时，我一个字一个字从“人、口、手、刀、木、工”教起，教了大约有六七百个生字，一天一考试，教他读全队人的名字，教他写记工单，还把井下常用字“锹、楔、腿、架、梁”教给他。现在子明达到可以写信的水平。
    我是保勤员，每年到矿上保勤不下百十天，既当保安员，又当保勤员。咱矿的工人徐跃发爱人1978年去世了，家里扔下了三个男孩。当时大孩7岁，最小的只有3岁，徐跃发别说上班，就是一天照顾3个孩子也够他受的。我们几个家属为了让他安心上班，主动上他家给他打扫卫生，拆洗被褥、刷墙、糊棚，原来进不去人的屋子让我们收拾得焕然一新。后来，我们主动承包徐跃发家，大家轮流给他看家，看孩子。逢年过节，我们捐款，给他家包饺子；冬天做棉衣、棉被，夏天作单衣；孩子有病抱到医院打针；孩子到了上学年龄我们接送，直到最小的孩子上了三年级。感动得徐跃发常常热泪盈眶，大年初一把感谢信送到了矿工会和矿党委。
    怎么，你又记上了。告诉你，别写我，我太普通了。最后说一句，好好写写别的矿工母亲和妻子。再见了，“小秀才”。
    “世界是由普通和平凡所构成的。”于是，我还是写了她。她叫刘金荣，今年36岁。中等个儿，短发，黑里透红的脸庞。鹤岗矿务局大陆煤矿一名矿工的妻子，千千万万个矿工妻子中的一个。
