Taipei's stock market prices fell by 265.43 points on December 4, a decline of 2.97%.

Stock exchange brokers believe the drop is a reaction to the Kuomintang's (KMT) most severe defeat in an election to date, with concerns over the political future of Taiwan.

In this election, the KMT's total vote share dropped to 54.2%, securing 205 seats, which is 70% of the total. This result broke the previous expectation that the KMT would secure 70% of the votes while the opposition would get 30%. Over the past two days, various newspapers in Taiwan have published commentaries and editorials, calling on the KMT to deeply reflect on the reasons for its election defeat and to undertake "shame-aware reforms."

The KMT's election defeat has become a major topic of discussion throughout Taiwanese society.
