While deeply studying the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, Xinjiang is focusing on potential instability amidst stability and reflecting on difficulties and problems amidst prosperity. The region is taking the future as the starting point for all work, striving to reach new heights.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Xinjiang's economic construction and various undertakings have made significant strides each year, presenting a gratifying situation.

— The political environment in Xinjiang, symbolized by ethnic unity, is unprecedentedly stable. So far, one-third of the counties and cities in the entire region have been designated as model counties for ethnic unity and progress, as well as military-civilian unity.

— Agriculture and animal husbandry have seen 12 consecutive years of bumper harvests. From 1978 to this year, grain production has increased from 3.7 million tons to 6.15 million tons, with an average annual increase of over 200,000 tons; cotton production has risen from 55,000 tons to 300,000 tons, with an average annual growth of 17.6%. This year, the highest livestock breeding number exceeded 40 million for the first time, and the end-of-year inventory is expected to reach 33.8 million.

— Industrial development has been steady, with a balanced ratio between industry and agriculture. From 1978 to 1988, the total industrial output value increased by an average of 12.2% per year, without significant fluctuations. Agriculture grew by an average of 9.7% per year, with a growth ratio of 1:1.26 compared to industry, which is basically suitable for industrial production scale.

— Fiscal revenue has increased year by year, and the fiscal self-sufficiency rate has improved.

— Significant breakthroughs have been made in the exploration of the Tarim oil field, and preliminary results have been achieved in the exploration of non-ferrous metals and gold.

While studying and implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the various levels of party and government leadership in Xinjiang have not been complacent. Instead, they have sung fewer songs of praise and discussed more worries. In response to existing problems, various levels of organizations in Xinjiang are formulating specific and effective measures and plans. Currently, a high tide of basic agricultural construction is sweeping across the northern and southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains.

    在稳定中注意不稳定因素  在顺境中反思困难和问题
    新疆奋力攀登新高度
    本报乌鲁木齐12月4日电  记者曾坤报道：在深入学习五中全会精神时，新疆在稳定中注意不稳定因素，在顺境中反思困难和问题，把未来作为一切工作的出发点，奋力向新的高度攀登。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，新疆的经济建设和各项事业一年一步新台阶，显示出喜人局面。
    ——以民族团结为象征的新疆政治环境空前稳定。到目前为止，全疆已有1／3的县市建成民族团结进步和军民团结双模范县。
    ——农牧业连续12年丰收。从1978年到今年，粮食总产从370万吨上升到615万吨，平均每年增产20多万吨；棉花总产从5.5万吨上升到30万吨，年均增长17.6％。今年牲畜最高饲养量首次突破4000万头，预计年末存栏头数可达3380万头。
    ——工业发展速度平稳，工农业比例关系基本协调。从1978年到1988年，工业总产值平均年增长12.2％，没有出现大幅度的波动。农业年平均增长9.7％，与工业的增长比例为1∶1.26，基本适应工业生产规模。
    ——财政收入逐年增加，财政自给率提高。
    ——塔里木石油勘探取得重大突破，有色金属、黄金勘探取得初步成果。
    在学习贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神时，新疆各级党政领导并未沾沾自喜，而是赞歌唱得少，忧思谈得多。针对存在的问题，新疆各级组织正在制定具体有效措施和规划。目前，一个农田基本建设高潮正在天山南北热火朝天地展开。
