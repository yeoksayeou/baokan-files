From “Asai Yoneko” to “Du General Manager”

A Record of the Japanese Female Vice Chairman and Vice General Manager of the Sino-Japanese Joint Venture Tian Gong Restaurant

Reporter: Ji Hongkang

Although the first impression may not always be accurate, my impression of the Japanese partner, Ms. Asai Yoneko, was spot on. Moreover, as I got to know her better, this first impression became even more vivid and rich.

Walking into the Tian Gong Restaurant, a Sino-Japanese joint venture less than 200 meters from the southern end of Tiananmen Square, a sense of freshness hits you. The Korean barbecue restaurant is tastefully decorated. Each table has a stove the size of a basin, with a perforated iron grill on top. Plates of fresh beef slices, chicken slices, fish slices, and more are served. Turn on the switch, and the flames dance under the grill. Drizzle a bit of oil on the grill, and you can grill whatever you like. “Sizzle, hiss…” The aroma fills the room. People sit in the elegant dining room, enjoying the Korean flavors, with a wild charm but without the smoke (the oil fumes are sucked away by the special equipment of the stove). It’s truly a delight.

What makes an even greater impression is a Japanese woman here, Ms. Asai Yoneko. As the Japanese vice chairman and vice general manager, she doesn’t act like a boss. When customers come, she greets them with the waitstaff; she constantly moves around the tables, “How is the food? Does it suit your taste?”

“Don’t overcook it, the meat turns white when it’s ready to eat, tender is delicious!” “How is the pickled vegetable? Korean pickled vegetables have over fifty varieties, and ours are even better than those sold on the street. Korean daughters take pickled vegetables as a necessary part of their dowry when they get married.” “Oh, you want to book a meal next time, don’t worry, we will serve you well.” She speaks fluent Northeastern Mandarin, enthusiastically guiding customers, promoting, and selling on the spot. If a grill runs out of oil, a table is dirty, or a customer needs more drinks, she helps the waitstaff refill, clean, and serve. The customers look at her with curiosity, and she seems to sense their thoughts, smiling and saying, “In Japan, running a restaurant means you have to work. The customers are like gods, bringing money, and you can’t treat them poorly.”

I haven’t seen many foreign female managers like her.

She is a true “China expert.” Born in Osaka, raised in Jilin. Her father is Chinese, and her mother is Japanese. She has lived in China for a total of 40 years, working as a teacher and a lab technician in the Northeast, and marrying an Indonesian Chinese and a graduate of Tsinghua University in Fushun. In 1983, the whole family moved to Japan.

“In Japan, should I be a housewife or do something? I’m not content to just stay in the kitchen, I decided to give it a try.” She was hired by Osaka Koushin Corporation to be the chief representative of the Beijing office of “Koushin.” In 1985, she came to China again. After “Koushin” decided to jointly open the Tian Gong Restaurant with the Chinese New Star Company, she became the Japanese representative of “Tian Gong.”

She opens the window of the fourth-floor Korean barbecue restaurant and excitedly says to us, “Look, how good our restaurant’s location is: to the north, you can see the Tiananmen Gate Tower, Tiananmen Square, and the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall; to the east, the Arrow Tower and Zhengyang Gate; to the south, the bustling commercial area of Qianmen. The Beijing Municipal Government and the Xuanwu District Government provided this prime location for us to open the restaurant, and I am very satisfied.”

When “Tian Gong” opened in September last year, only the first to third floors were operational. She thought it would be a waste of this prime location, so after discussing with the Chinese side, she started working on the fourth floor, specializing in Korean barbecue, striving to make a name for itself. She started working like a whirlwind.

Patented barbecue equipment and air conditioning needed to be imported, and she rushed between Japan, Hong Kong, and Beijing.

The fourth floor needed a special kitchen and restrooms, so she ran to the city planning bureau and got special permission to build on the large balcony.

The tableware was not yet settled, so she led a team straight to Tangshan.

The relevant Chinese parties also provided great support. She took the initiative because she was familiar with the people, and the foreign representative’s status seemed to make things easier. Of course, the most important thing is that she is willing to work, she is deeply connected with “Tian Gong,” and she has feelings for China.

She said, “China is so big, it’s hard to manage; I have seen with my own eyes how the Chinese people have struggled. The changes in the past 10 years of opening up are tremendous, and you can see it all from Beijing. I have been educated in China for so long, and China needs people like me with this bloodline to build bridges and be matchmakers. I should do my best for China.”

This seems unbelievable. She personally went to Tangshan to purchase tableware because the factory had difficulty supplying a large batch of goods on short notice. However, the Korean barbecue restaurant had to start trial operations before the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, and there was no time to waste. When the factory director learned that she was a foreign representative in her fifties who was working so hard for the joint venture, he was deeply moved. Support, definitely support, immediately approve the supply of a batch of bone china tableware and ashtrays. At that time, it was already late, and it was not possible to transport them back to Beijing immediately; plus, she wanted to use the time to check the seafood supply in Changli, so she went straight there and stayed at the county guesthouse for a night. The girl who went with her said, “Even I found the conditions of that guesthouse poor, but she didn’t mind at all. She didn’t pick the place to stay or the food to eat.” When I asked her about this with a bit of curiosity and confusion, she just said, “We just wanted to get the job done quickly, so we stayed at the county guesthouse.” She didn’t mention anything about the conditions being good or bad.

She has the color of the 1950s Chinese people. She said, “We are all people from the 1950s. If you live for money, that’s meaningless. The career is important.”

Of course, this does not mean that as a representative of the Japanese joint venture, she does not want to make money for her boss. She is very clear about this. She said, “I brought 1.35 million dollars, accounting for 85% of the capital.” “Tian Gong” has been in operation for nearly a year, and the business situation is not as expected, and some things have really given her a headache, but she is not discouraged and said:

“I believe in China’s policies. With such a good location, I don’t believe the restaurant won’t make money.” She also told a Korean girl in the store, “Don’t just look at the present, do a job and do it well, don’t lose confidence when you encounter setbacks.”

She has paved the way. The Korean barbecue restaurant has been in trial operation for only two months, and its reputation has begun to spread. A group of reporters from the European Community came twice; nearly 20 people from Osaka’s Merl Corporation, reporters from the Yomiuri Shimbun and Japanese radio, customers from Hong Kong, Korea, and some famous people in Beijing, as well as other individual customers, have all come to visit. “Ah! This place is so beautiful.” “Your Korean barbecue is top-notch even in Washington.” “You have a service style like European hotels, very efficient.” The customers’ praises never stopped.

Tiananmen Square is right in front. She witnessed the June incident. She didn’t leave, saying, “It’s okay, this country is different from others, the situation will stabilize.” On September 30th, she was invited to attend the national reception; on the night of National Day, she went to the Tiananmen Rostrum to watch the ceremony. She smiled and took out her album, “Look, I even took a photo with Jiang Zemin, Wang Zhen, and other leaders at the reception.”

“Our Du General Manager (her Chinese name is Du Minzhong)…” The people at “Tian Gong” don’t call her by her Japanese name. So, I also changed from calling her “Ms. Asai Yoneko” at first to calling her “Du General Manager.”

    从“浅井米子”到“杜总”
    ——记中日合资天宫酒家日方女副董事长兼副总经理
    本报记者　计泓赓
    虽说第一印象不一定很准，但日本合资者浅井米子女士给我的感觉却是无误的。而且随着接触的增多，这第一印象越来越鲜亮和丰满了。
    走进离天安门广场南端不到200米的中日合资天宫酒家，一股新鲜感扑面而来。那朝鲜烧烤餐厅，布置淡雅，每一餐桌中央，都安有一个脸盆大小的炉具，上架镂空铁篦。一盘盘鲜灵灵的生牛肉片、生鸡片、生鱼片……端上来了，启动开关，火苗就在铁篦下窜跳，铁篦抹上点油，你可以想吃什么就挟什么在上面烧烤。“吱吱，咝咝……”，顿时满室生香。人们坐在雅室里品尝朝鲜风味，极富野趣而又不见烟雾缭绕（油烟都给炉具特制设备抽走了），真乃一桩乐事也。
    更使人感到新鲜的是这里的一位日籍女士浅井米子。她身为日方副董事长兼副总经理，一点不摆派头。客人来了，她和服务员一起接待；她不停地在餐桌旁转，“吃得怎样，对不对口味？”
  “别烤老了，肉的颜色变白就能吃，嫩才鲜美！”“咸菜好不好？朝鲜咸菜有五六十种，这里的比一般街上卖的还有味道。朝鲜女儿出嫁，咸菜是一种必不可少的嫁妆呢。”“噢，您下次还要预定饭菜，请放心，一定服务好。”她操着一口流利的东北味普通话，热情地在“导吃”，在作现场宣传，现场销售。哪个炉篦油少了，桌子脏了，哪位客人需要添饮料，她帮服务员去添、去擦、去送。客人们用新奇的眼光打量着她，她似乎察觉了客人的心态，笑笑说：“在日本，当酒家老板没有不干活的。来吃饭的客人都是送钱来的，是神仙，不能亏待。”
    像这样的外方女经理，我见得不多。
    她可谓“中国通”。生在大阪，长在吉林。父亲是中国人，母亲是日本人。前后在中国生活了40年之久，在东北当过教员、化验员等，在抚顺与一位印尼华侨、清华大学毕业生结婚。1983年全家去日本。
    “到日本，是做家庭主妇？还是做点事？我不甘心围着锅台转，决心闯一闯。”她受日本大阪光中株式会社之聘，担任“光中”驻北京办事处首席代表，1985年又来到中国。“光中”决定与中方新兴公司合资开办天宫酒家后，她改任“天宫”日方负责人。
    她推开四楼朝鲜烧烤餐厅的窗户，兴奋地对我们说：“请看，我们酒家的地段有多好：北可眺望天安门城楼、天安门广场、毛主席纪念堂；东边是前门箭楼和正阳门；南边是繁华的前门商业区。北京市和宣武区人民政府提供这块宝地让我们办酒家，我太满意了。”
    “天宫”去年9月开业时只有1—3层营业。她认为不能辜负了这黄金地带，酒家一定要办得与众不同，与中方合计后，就又着手新辟四楼，专营朝鲜烧烤，力争打出个知名度来。她像旋风似地干开了。
    专利的烧烤设备以及空调等需要进口，她奔波于日本、香港、北京之间。
    四楼需要专用厨房和卫生间，她跑市城建局，获特别批准：在大阳台上加盖。
    餐具还没着落呢，她带人直奔唐山。
    中国有关各方也给予很大支持，她之所以亲自出马，一则她人头较熟，二则外方代表的牌子似乎也硬些，事情要好办些。当然，更主要的，她肯干，她与“天宫”贴心贴肉，她对中国有感情。
    她说：“中国那么大，要管好多不容易；我亲眼看到中国人民是怎样奋斗过来的。开放这10年变化就是大，从北京完全可以看得出来。我在中国受教育那么长时间，中国需要我这样血统的人来搭桥，当红娘。我应该为中国尽心尽力。”
    这似乎是不可思议的。她亲自到唐山去采购餐具，因为是临时要的一大批现货，厂家供应有困难。可朝鲜烧烤餐厅一定要赶在国庆40周年前试营业，刻不容缓。当厂长了解到她是一位年过半百的外方负责人，竟如此为办好合资企业而操劳，深深被感动了。支持，一定支持，马上批条供应一批骨灰瓷餐具和烟缸等。当时时间已晚，不可能马上拉回北京；加上她还想利用时间去昌黎摸一下海鲜供应问题，就直奔那里，在县招待所住了一夜。和她同去的姑娘说：“那个招待所连我都嫌条件差，可她全不在乎。不挑住，不挑吃。”当我多少带点好奇和不解的心理问起这件事时，她只是说：“那次我们只是想赶快把事办完，就在县招待所住下了。”什么条件好不好，她压根儿一字未提。
    在她身上，带有中国50年代人的色彩。她说：“我们都是50年代过来的人。人要是为了钱活着，那才没有意思喽，事业要紧。”
    当然，这并不意味着她作为日方合资者代表，不要为她的老板赚钱。要为光中株式会社获利，这点她是很明确的。她说：“我带来135万美元哪，占股本85％。”“天宫”创办近一年，营业情况还不如人意，有些事也着实使她伤透脑筋，但她毫不灰心，说：
  “我相信中国的政策。就凭这么好的地理位置，我不信酒家不会赚钱。”她还对店内一位朝鲜族姑娘说：“你不要光看眼前，干一件事就要干到底，不要碰点钉子，遇到坎坷就丧失信心。”
    她硬把路踩出来了。朝鲜烧烤餐厅试营业不过两个月，声名开始远扬。欧洲共同体的一群记者，先后来了两次；日本大阪美尔宝株式会社一行近20人、《读卖新闻》和日本电台的记者来了；香港、朝鲜等客人，北京的一些知名人士以及其他散客也都来光顾。“啊！这儿真美。”“你们这朝鲜烧烤，在华盛顿也算得上第一流。”“你们像欧洲酒店服务方式，效率很高。”客人赞声不绝。
    天安门就在跟前。她目睹了6月风波。她没走，说：“没关系，中国这国家跟别的国家不同，局面会安定的。”9月30日，她应邀出席了我国庆招待会；国庆之夜还上天安门观礼台观礼。她笑盈盈地拿出相册，“看，我在招待会上还和江泽民、王震等领导人照了相呢。”
    “我们的杜总（她的中国名字叫杜敏中）……”“天宫”的人都不叫她的日本名字。于是乎，我也从最初的“浅井米子女士”而改以“杜总”相称了。
