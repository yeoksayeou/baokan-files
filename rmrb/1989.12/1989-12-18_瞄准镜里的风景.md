On November 7, 1988, in the Guangxi First Prison located on the outskirts of Guilin City, a unprecedented incident occurred in the history of the People's Republic of China: a prisoner took a prison officer hostage.

The incident took place in a small office on the second floor at the end of a large mechanical processing workshop. In the morning, the young female statistician Xiao Meng, still a child at heart, was engrossed in a pile of reports as usual. Suddenly, she heard the distinctive, subservient tone of a criminal addressing the "government": "I, I have a petition to submit..." Xiao Meng frowned: how dare this guy violate prison regulations and enter the office unannounced? The noise from the machines in the workshop prevented her from hearing footsteps. Xiao Meng was about to speak when, with a "swoosh," a sharp triangular scraper was pressed against her nose!

"Do not be afraid," the criminal smiled angelically, "they release me, and I will release you." Step by step, he backed her into the corner. Xiao Meng shouted loudly, "Help! The prisoner is attacking!"

Several officers rushed to the door but had to stop.

Just a few more steps and they could have subdued the criminal, but his thick, dark left arm was tightly wrapped around Xiao Meng's neck, and the sharp knife was pressed against her lower back. The criminal shouted, "All of you, get down the stairs! Anyone who dares to come forward or raise a gun, I'll stab her! Bring a long bamboo pole with a walkie-talkie! I have demands!"

The 34-year-old criminal, He Yi, had attempted murder (unsuccessful, but caused permanent disability), escaped from prison twice, and had his sentence extended twice. He had already served 12 years and was scheduled to be released in 1994. Now he made three demands:

1. The President of the Supreme People's Court should immediately fly to Guilin to declare him innocent and release him on the spot;
2. Immediately send his father's urn from Liuzhou;
3. Then, dispatch a special car to take him to Beijing to appear on CCTV to "appeal to the nation."

Incident time: 9:50 AM.

At 10:15 AM, leaders from the Guilin Public Security Bureau and the Judicial Bureau arrived at the First Prison, and the on-site command center began operations.

At 10:30 AM, the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Reform Bureau sent a message: "Under the premise of ensuring the safety of the hostage, decisively punish the hijacker."

The on-site command center formulated one plan after another, only to reject them all. The final plan was: remotely and covertly eliminate the criminal. However, the criminal was always tightly holding the hostage, so who would take the shot?

At 2:10 PM, officials from the Public Security Bureau and the Judicial Bureau went to the Guilin Military Academy for help. The leaders of the Military Academy immediately reported to the Guangzhou Military Region, expressing confidence in completing the mission, and ordered the Shooting Technology Research Office to prepare.

The military region commander quickly responded, approving the Military Academy to participate in the battle.

At 3:40 PM, the director of the Shooting Technology Research Office, Colonel Guo Ning, and instructors Zhang Jike and Wu Guohe arrived at the prison.

The criminal was still holding the female statistician in the corner of the wall, his eyes alertly scanning back and forth. The small room on the second floor had a wide view on both sides. To his left was the door, outside of which was the workshop. The prisoners had been taken back to their cells, the machines had stopped, and the scattered parts and debris made the entire large workshop seem empty for the first time. To his right was the window, outside of which was unusually bustling.

Not far from the window was the prison gate and the high wall. Inside the wall, several correctional officers held walkie-talkies and took turns talking to him: it has been reported to Beijing... Outside the wall, police cars, vans, and jeeps were parked in a large area, crowded in front of the prison gate, like a ferry terminal with guards standing by. People in police uniforms, armed police uniforms, and later even soldiers in PLA uniforms came and went, running back and forth. He looked down from his high vantage point at all this. He seemed to be the commander, with all the vehicles on the ground and the planes in the sky all obediently following his orders. Let them see some color! The tip of the knife pressed down just a little, and blood quickly seeped through the hostage's uniform at the waist, the bloodstain still spreading...

This little girl is not afraid of death! Her palms were also cut to the bone by the triangular blade, but she still dared to softly persuade the criminal: "He Yi, if you release me, we will still be lenient with you."

"Release you? No way!"

At 4:55 PM, five minutes before the final deadline.

The criminal shouted into the walkie-talkie: "Time is up! I'm going to act!"

There were people in the workshop, and they were snipers. After the military school's shooters arrived at the prison, they took off their uniforms, wrapped their carefully adjusted long guns in clothes, and sneaked into the workshop from behind, hiding behind a large pile of packing boxes and steel ingots. After several attempts, they determined the shooting position.

This was in the southeast corner of the workshop, more than 100 meters away from the office on the second floor to the north. From the angle, the office door was just a narrow slit. Through the slit, one could see a figure but could not distinguish whether it was male or female.

In the 40x magnifying scope of Director Guo Ning and the telescopic sights on Zhang Jike and Wu Guohe's guns, even if a head occasionally appeared in the slit, it was the criminal's head partially obscured by the hostage. With their years of shooting experience, they believed there would be an opportunity to capture.

"Only one shot is allowed." Earlier, the public security bureau chief had explained the action plan in the most concise language, and the three did not ask any more questions. They all knew very well: if a second shot was needed, it would mean what for the hostage's life and the soldier's honor.

The muzzles of the two Type 79 sniper rifles were aimed motionlessly at the position where the criminal would appear alone in the slit. Although it seemed motionless, the shooters themselves saw clearly that their heartbeats caused the center arrow of the highly sensitive sight to jump slightly. The center arrow of the sight was the tip of the shooter's heart. However, this slight jump would not cause a shooting error, as their hearts had been well-trained.

Finally, half of the criminal's head appeared, 10 centimeters away from the hostage.

The two shooters immediately reported: "Ready." "Ready."

Director Guo gave the order: "One, two—"

"No, no!" Zhang Jike's index finger, which was already pulling the trigger, relaxed as the criminal's head slipped out of the sight.

When Colonel Zhang Jike and Captain Wu Guohe were selected for this one-shot mission, Director Guo Ning did not think much about it. The academy's leaders had given the task urgently, and there were few people in the office, most of the instructors had gone to class, and there was no time to carefully select all 19 instructors in the research office. Besides, there was no need to carefully select. This research office was a famous group of sharpshooters in the entire army. The previous year, when 26 foreign military attachés came to the academy for a visit, the 9 heroes of the research office stood in a row and performed a burst of submachine gun fire. Before the second hand of the clock had completed one circle, 1200 bullets had been fired, with a hit rate of 96%! That large group of military attachés all gave thumbs up.

The evil head in the sight of the Guangzhou Military Region's shooting champion, Zhang Jike, swayed back and forth, and was spouting madness again. The aiming arrow patiently waited for the moment when this bald head would stabilize. He had been holding a gun for 20 years, but this was the first time he had aimed at a human head. Of course, this was an evil head, but half of it was overlapping with the hostage's head. What if he missed?

He had once injured a woman: his aunt. As a child, he loved to shoot arrows, aiming at the round target on the white plaster wall next to the door of a farmhouse in Quanzhou County. His aunt had just stepped through the door when an arrow whizzed past and hit her face. His father beat him severely. His aunt's face was left with a small scar. Nearly 20 years later, Zhang Jike returned home with several shiny medals. After that, his aunt treated the scar on her face as her nephew's masterpiece.

Wu Guohe, on the other hand, did not care whether the head in the sight was paper or flesh. His gun had shown its might nearly 10 years ago. During the battle at Sanxing Cave, he climbed alone up the cliff-like wall to the cave entrance and fed the enemy a full meal of cluster grenades; the unlucky enemy tried to escape from the back entrance, so he quickly jumped down and guarded the gun. In the setting sun, the silhouette of the stone mountain ridge was exquisite. One by one, the active silhouettes fell into the valley... How refreshing!

Now, finding the aiming line was more careful than assembling a Swiss automatic dual calendar watch. The high and low irregular machine tools, the layer upon layer of beams and columns, and the iron railings of the corridor, plus the two desks in the door slit, constructed many layers of barriers for the criminal's body. The criminal's shoulders were not obstructed, but according to the combat plan, that was Zhang Jike's responsibility, and he was only allowed to shoot the criminal's body. With the meticulousness of an excellent shooter, he found the only aiming line in the overlapping obstacles—the shortest distance between the gun muzzle and the criminal's right hip bone.

The second aiming.

The arrow in the sight was fixed on the criminal's right temple.

Zhang Jike's right index finger gradually increased the pressure.

The real shooting enthusiasm came after Lin Biao's self-destruction. The new recruit Zhang Jike was also full of ambition in the pigsty, drawing a chest target on the low wall of the pigpen with lime, hanging a brick on the gun barrel to practice shooting, and every time his arms ached and shook, he clenched his teeth even tighter, determined to keep the aperture steady for a while before treating those old gentlemen.

Later, his shooting also reached a wonderful realm: when pulling the trigger, he intentionally increased the pressure of his index finger, but in the end, it was unintentionally fired. In a daze, the bullet seemed to fly out by itself, hitting the target every time.

Wu Guohe's sight was always steadily locked onto the criminal's right hip bone.

As an excellent shooter, he had also reached the wonderful realm of shooting unconsciously, and as an amateur painter, he often drew divine strokes unconsciously. He was a person of extraordinary spirit. In the early 1970s, he was still a technician at the cement factory of Wenchang High School in Hainan, working without pay. As long as he concentrated, he could accurately diagnose which part of the ball mill had a problem. He was a person who was both introverted and daring. After enlisting for 8 months, he became the military training model of the entire regiment, performing military physical exercises with astonishing difficulty, very elegantly; in the open-water marathon, he was the champion; in the beach assault drill, the most troublesome thing was shooting at the shore target from a fast-moving rubber boat. He practiced hard, and no matter how his body swayed and rocked, the two suspended guns in his arms were like the gyroscope on a ship, always pointing at the shore target.

The criminal was furious again, shouting into the walkie-talkie: "Why aren't the court officials here yet? I'm going to act!"

As soon as the words fell, the triangular scraper pressed down again, piercing the hostage's waist once more. A sharp cry!

The management director hurriedly shouted into the walkie-talkie: "The court officials are here! Look—"

Three tables were set up on the concrete path under the statistics room window, ready for negotiations. The director looked at his watch: 3 minutes to 5 o'clock. After 7 hours of stalemate, the criminal was approaching the dangerous period of psychological agitation. Why hasn't the workshop side fired yet?

Still in that posture, bent over, half-standing, half-crouching, leaning forward, like two shooting statues, unmoving. This strenuous aiming posture was difficult for any old shooter to maintain for 5 minutes.

Evaluating a shooter's skill, ordinary people look at the ring count, but experts look at the aiming posture, and that's how they rank.

A good opportunity appeared in the telescope! The criminal's left arm loosened from the hostage's neck, reaching for the walkie-talkie on the table, shouting something, leaning forward, away from the female statistician.

The third order: "One, two—"

"No, no!" Just as they were about to fire, the hostage's head suddenly moved, overlapping with the criminal's head again.

Behind the pile of steel ingots and packing boxes, they remained as calm and composed as ever.

Wu Guohe could almost recite several versions of "Shooting Theory" by heart, was he so fond of it? Shooting, wasn't it just the three links of aiming, aiming, and firing? Simple, boring. But he was deeply immersed in the endless mysteries within. He found that every instructor in their research office, every sharpshooter in the world, had their own unique aiming methods and styles. He adopted the best from everyone based on his own physique and strength. He was excellent with all kinds of light weapons, but he always found something to improve. People shoot with their eyes following the three-point line, but he repeatedly adjusted the focal length of his sight, looking out, retracting, looking out again, retracting...

...Relaxed, leisurely, the bullet automatically flew out of the barrel, growing eyes...

Whether it was Guo Ning, Zhang Jike, or Wu Guohe, they had all reached a state of near effortless shooting, almost to the point of being supernatural.

But weapons are tools of violence. No matter how much insight and diligence one has, one can never reach the point of shooting at will.

...The attack on Sanxing Cave was intense, and suddenly Wu Guohe's thigh was hot, and the area around his crotch quickly turned red. Four other soldiers lay beside him. Another rocket was fired from the cave.

"Grenade!" He took the grenade from the soldier who came to rescue him and threw three of them. The medic ran up to bandage him.

"Explosive package!" He tied four packages of explosives into a large ball, pulled the fuse, and threw it in. The earth shook and the mountains trembled. The ammunition pile inside the cave exploded, and it kept exploding for an hour.

When the medic brought the stretcher, he had already rushed to the front. His leg, with the shrapnel still in it, fought for another five days until the retreat, before being sent to the Pingxiang Hospital for surgery. The wound had already become infected. After a week in the hospital, he smiled and returned to the company.

...Four months before Wu Guohe was injured, in the shooting range of a certain military factory in Xi'an, Zhang Jike participated in the final test of a new type of gun. As an invited shooter, he was the authoritative evaluator of the new gun's technical performance. Whether this factory would produce the new gun depended on his shooting results. The engineer crouched beside him, observing the shooting situation, his heart pounding.

Not bad, the mechanism was sensitive, the bullet ejection was crisp, and the rhythm of the gunshots was even and smooth. The engineer gradually smiled on his face. Suddenly, there was a "clang," the gunshot stopped, and the gun's cover flew up, hitting Zhang Jike's right eye socket. Stars flashed before his eyes.

The engineer panicked, holding Zhang Jike's head: "Don't shoot anymore, it's over, go to the hospital!"

Zhang Jike wiped the blood from the corner of his eye with a handkerchief and picked up another gun. Load.

The gun's song resumed, singing evenly and smoothly.

The new gun passed the test.

The criminal relaxed and sat down, putting down the walkie-talkie, taking out a cigarette from the box on the table, putting it in his mouth, lighting it, and comfortably exhaling a large mouthful of smoke.

He had already seen several court officials walking towards the prison workshop. He won! He wanted to first enjoy a little taste of victory, and then...

He deeply inhaled the second puff of smoke.

A thunderclap! Two beams of light pierced his body.

His body softened and collapsed. A wisp of smoke slowly drifted out of his mouth, followed by a string of blood bubbles...

The female statistician rushed out of the door.

The management director looked at his watch: 5 o'clock sharp.

From the first aiming to the elimination of the criminal, it took a total of 5 minutes.

Guo Ning ran to the statistics room on the second floor, and the armed police and prison guards had already rushed in.

Zhang Jike and Wu Guohe stayed in their original positions, following the shooting regulations to open the gun chamber and check the gun: empty chamber. Only one bullet was loaded.

A large crowd gathered at the prison gate, and the criminal was dragged there. Those who identified the body, took photos and videos, maintained order, and those who had a good look, all busied themselves around the bloody body, gesturing, cursing, and exclaiming...

The two did not go to see the shooting effect, bypassing the crowd watching the spectacle, they walked out of the prison gate and went straight to the van that would take them back to the academy. The two sniper rifles were very dazzling. The guards at the prison gate respectfully watched them: one was dressed in a military casual suit without shoulder boards or badges, with an open collar and exposed chest; the other was wearing a worn-out black jacket, with slippers on his feet, and his body and head covered with plaster and dust.

Two bullets hit the criminal simultaneously. One entered from the right ear and exited from the left forehead; the other entered from the right hip and exited from the perineum, and the bullet shattered when it hit the thigh bone.

The next day, the prison workshop resumed work as usual. The prisoners who had returned to their cells early the day before returned to their respective machine tools to work.

The management director accompanied the female statistician around the workshop. It was exactly the same as before, except that her right hand was wrapped in bandages.

Not just one prisoner stuck out his tongue.

Back home, Wu Guohe continued to paint a picture. Zhang Jike continued to work as a painter...

The world of scenery in people's eyes returned to its usual tranquility.

    瞄准镜里的风景
    军心
    1988年11月7日，在位于桂林市郊的广西第一监狱里，发生了共和国历史上前所未有的在押犯劫持干警作人质的特大案件。
    事情发生在巨大的机械加工车间尽头二楼上一间小小的办公室里。上午，还是个十足的大孩子的女统计员小蒙像往常一样，正埋头在一大堆报表中，耳边突然响起了罪犯特有的对“政府”的卑恭的语调：“我，我来交一份申诉书……”。小蒙眉头一皱：这家伙怎么敢违反狱规自行进入办公室？满车间机器的轰鸣使她没能听到脚步声。小蒙刚要说话，“嗖”地一声，一把尖利的三角刮刀逼上了她的鼻梁！
      “不要怕，”罪犯天使般地微笑着，“他们放了我，我就放了你。”一步，一步，把她逼到了屋角。小蒙连声高喊：“快来人！罪犯行凶！”几名干警迅速冲到门口，又不得不煞住。
    再跨进去五六步就能制住罪犯，但他粗黑的左臂勒紧了小蒙的脖子，右手的尖刀抵住她的后腰。罪犯大叫：“全给老子退下楼去！谁敢上前谁敢举枪老子就捅了她！用长竹竿递上对讲机来！老子要提条件！”
    34岁的罪犯贺谊荣杀过人（未遂，已造成终身残疾），越狱过两次，加了两次刑，已服刑12年，1994年刑满。现在他提出了三条要求：
      一、国家最高人民法院院长马上飞来桂林宣布他无罪，当场释放；
    二、立即从柳州将他父亲的骨灰盒送来；
    三、然后，派专车送他去北京，上中央电视台“向全国人民申诉”。
    案发时间：上午9时50分。
    10时15分，桂林市公安局、司法局领导赶到第一监狱，现场指挥部开始工作。
    10时30分，中华人民共和国司法部、广西壮族自治区劳改局来电：“在保证人质安全的前提
  下坚决制裁劫持分子。”
      现场指挥部制定了一个又一个行动方案，又都给否定掉了。最后确定的方案是：远距离隐蔽击毙罪犯。但是罪犯一直紧紧夹住人质，谁来担任射手？
      下午2时10分，市公安局、司法局的同志来到桂林陆军学院求援。陆军学院领导马上向广州军区请示，表示有信心完成任务，随即命令射击技术教研室作准备。
      军区首长很快答复，批准陆院派人参加战
  斗。
    3时40分，射击技术教研室主任郭宁生中校、教员蒋基凯中校和吴国和上尉等到达监狱。
      罪犯一直勒着女统计员缩在墙角里，他的眼睛一直警觉地来回扫视着。这间二楼上的小屋两
  边的视境都很开阔。他的左侧是门，门外是车间，犯人们早被押回监舍，机床停转，零件杂物
  散堆，他还是头一次看到整个巨大的车间空无一
  人。左边是窗，窗外却是头一次如此热闹非凡。
  离窗不远就是监狱的大门和高墙。墙里，几个管
  教干部手执对讲机轮流对他喊话：已经上报北京
  了……墙外，警车、面包车、吉普车停了一大
  片，挤在狱门前的马路上，活像一个警卫林立的
  轮渡码头。穿公安服、武警服、后来还加上了穿
  解放军军装的人们来往穿梭，跑去跑来。他居高临下地扫视着这一切。他俨然像调动一切的司
  令，地上的车辆、天上的飞机，全都得乖乖听他
  的。给你们点颜色看看！刀尖往下只按了那么一点，鲜血很快就渗透了人质警服的腰部，血迹还在扩大……
    这个小姑娘不怕死！她的手掌也被三棱尖刃割得血肉模糊，却还敢柔声细语地做罪犯的工作：“贺谊荣，你只要放开我，我们还会对你宽大的。”
      “放开你？休想！”
    下午4时55分。离最后限定的时刻还有五分钟。
    罪犯对着对讲机大吼：
      “时间就要到了！老子要动手了！”
    车间里有人，而且是狙击手。军校的射手们到达监狱后，脱下军装，用衣服包住精心矫准的长枪，绕到车间后面罪犯视角的死角，从窗口潜了进去，躲在一大堆包装箱和钢锭的后面，几经选择，确定了射击位置。
    这是在车间的东南角，距北边那个二楼上的办公室已是100多米远。斜角里看去，那办公室的门只是一条窄缝，从缝里看得见人影，辨不出男女。
    在郭宁生主任的40倍望远镜和蒋基凯、吴国和枪管上的望远瞄准镜里，门缝间即使难得一见地闪现一下人头，也是罪犯被女人质挡住的头。凭着多年的射击经验，他们坚信，总是有机会可以捕捉到的。
      “只准打一枪。”刚才，公安局长以最扼要的语言说明了行动方案，三个人都没再提问题。他们都很清楚：如果还需要打第二枪，对人质的生命和军人的荣誉意味着什么。
    两只79式狙击步枪的枪口纹丝不动地对准了门缝中罪犯将会单独闪现的位置。说是纹丝不动，那是从旁观者的眼中看来。两名射手自己看得很分明，他们的心脏每跳动一下，高度灵敏的瞄准镜中心的箭头就微微跳动一下。瞄准镜的中心箭头就是射手的心尖子。不过那个细微的跳动不会造成射击误差，他们的心脏早就训练有素了。
    终于，罪犯的脑袋露出了半边，偏离了人质
  10厘米。
    两名射手马上报告：
      “准备完毕。”“准备完毕。”
    郭主任发令：“一、二——”
      “不行不行！”蒋基凯勾着扳机的食指已经开始加力，瞄准镜里的贼头又溜出镜外。
    挑选中校蒋基凯与上尉吴国和来执行这个只打一枪的任务，郭宁生主任当时并没有多想。学院首长的任务下得急，办公室里找不到几个人，
  大部分教官都去上课了，时间不容他把全教研室
  19个教官细选一遍。本来就无需乎左筛右选。这个教研室是闻名全军的神枪手群体。前年，26国
  驻华武官来学院参观那次，教研室9名好汉一字排开，表演冲锋枪连射，秒针还没跑完一圈就射
  完了1200发子弹，命中率96％！那一大群武官们
  连伸大拇指。
      邪恶的脑袋在广州军区射击冠军蒋基凯的瞄
  准镜里摇来晃去，又在口吐狂言了。瞄准箭头耐心地等着这颗光头的片刻稳定。操枪20个春秋，他还是第一次用枪口对向一颗人头。当然，这是一颗罪恶的脑袋，可是，有一半与女人质的头重合着，万一误伤呢？
    他曾经误伤过一个女人：他的姑姑。小时候最爱张弓搭箭，对准全州县那堵农舍土墙上门边白膏泥用的圆靶。姑姑刚刚跨进门，一支呼啸而至的箭就扑到了她脸上。父亲狠狠揍了他一顿。姑姑的脸上永远留下了一个小尖疤。近20年后，蒋基凯带着几块金灿灿的奖牌回乡探亲。从那以后，姑姑就把脸上的箭疤当作侄子的天才作品展览。
    吴国和却不在乎瞄准镜里的人头是纸的还是肉的，他的枪口近10年前就大显神威了。在三星洞那次同越军作战，他只身攀上大墙般的峭壁升到洞口，饱饱喂了敌军一顿集束手榴弹；不料没炸死的敌人要从后洞口溜，赶紧跳下去据枪守候。晚霞中石山脊的剪影妙不可言。洞里出来一个，他点射一个。那一个个活动的剪影掉下山沟，栽向深谷……何等痛快淋漓！
    现在找瞄准线却得比装配瑞士自动双历表还要小心翼翼。大车间里高低突兀的机床，层层排排的梁柱，还有楼道的铁栏杆，再加上门缝里的两张办公桌，为罪犯的身体构设了好多道严实的屏障，那贼小子肩膀以上倒是没有遮拦，不过按作战方案，那是蒋基凯的责任田，他只许打罪犯的身体。凭着特等射手的细心，他居然在重重迭迭的障碍之中，找到了那条唯一的瞄准线——枪口与罪犯右臀环跳穴这两点之间的最短距离。
    第二次瞄准。
    镜中的箭头钉住了罪犯的右太阳穴。
    蒋基凯右手的食指渐渐加力。
    真正的练兵热是在林彪自我爆炸之后。新兵蒋基凯在猪场里也壮心不已，在猪圈的矮墙上用石灰画个胸靶，枪管上吊块砖头练据枪，每一次臂膀酸疼得摇晃起来牙关都咬得加倍紧，一定到缺口准星能再稳稳当当好一阵子，才去款待那些八戒老爷少爷们。
    后来，他的射击也达到了奇妙的境界：扣扳机时有意增加食指的压力，最后却是在无意中击发，恍恍惚惚之际，子弹似乎就自己飞了出去，百发百中。
    吴国和的瞄准镜始终稳稳地套定罪犯的右环跳穴。
      作为特等射手，他也早达到了不知不觉间就打出神枪的奇妙境界，而作为一个业余画家，也往往在不知不觉之际挥出了神妙之笔。他灵性过人，70年代初，还是海南文昌高中的学生，就是校办水泥厂无工资的技师，只要凝神一听，就能号准球磨机哪个部位有毛病。他是个内秀而又敢拚命的人，入伍8个月就成了全团的军训标兵，军体器械令人咋舌的高难度动作，练得十分潇洒；泅海马拉松
  赛，他是冠军；冲击滩头演习，最伤脑筋的是在快
  进的橡皮舟上打岸靶，他一番苦练，无论身体如何
  起伏摇摆，两只悬空举枪的胳膊却像海船上的陀
  螺，总能让枪口指向岸靶。
    罪犯又一次暴怒起来，冲着对讲机大吼：“法院的人为什么还不来？我要动手了！”
    话音一落，三棱刮刀就往下按了一点，又一回刺破了人质的腰部。一声尖呼！
    管理科长朝对讲机急喊：“法院的人已经来了！这不——”
    三张条桌在统计室窗下的水泥路上摆开，作出一个准备谈判的架势。科长抬腕看表：5点差3分。僵持了7个小时，罪犯临近危险的心理狂躁期。车间那头怎么还不打响？
    仍然是那个姿势、勾身，半站，半蹲，重心前倾，如两尊射击雕塑，岿然不动。这种吃力的瞄准姿势任何老射手都难坚持5分钟。
    评价射手的功夫，一般人看环数，而行家一看据枪瞄准的姿势，就分出等次了。
    望远镜里出现了良机！罪犯的左臂从人质的脖子上松开，伸到桌上拿起对讲机，喊着什么，身体前倾，离开了女统计员。
    第三次发令：“一、二——”
    “不行不行！”就在准备击发的瞬间，女人质的头突然一动，又与罪犯的头重合了。
  钢锭和包装箱堆后依然那么从容镇定。
      《射击学理》吴国和几乎可以倒背如流几种版本了，就那么百读不厌吗？射击，不就是据枪、瞄准、击发三个环节吗？简单，枯燥。他却深深沉醉于其中的无穷奥妙。他发现，他们教研室的每个教官，世上的每个神枪手都有自己的独特的据枪方法和风格，他根据自己的身材和力度博采众家之长。各种轻武器他都一打就是优秀，但他不断地找得出自己打哪种枪还要改进哪一点。人们打枪都是目光沿着三点一线放出去，他却是反复调整视点焦距，视线放出，回收，再放，再收……
    ……轻松，悠然，子弹自动飞出了枪膛，长出了眼睛……
    郭宁生也好，蒋基凯也好，吴国和也好，在射击上都已经达到了近乎无为而为出神入化的境界。
    但是，兵器是凶器，光靠悟性和勤奋，无论如何也达不到从心所欲的地步。
    ……攻打三星洞正紧张，吴国和的大腿根忽然一热，裤洞周围很快就红了一片。另外四个战士倒在旁边。洞口又飞出来一枚火箭弹。
      “手榴弹！”他拿过赶来接应的战士手中的弹，连投三颗。卫生员跑上来给他包扎。
      “炸药包！”他把四包炸药捆成个大圆球，一拉导火索，狠命抛滚进去。地动山摇。洞内的弹药堆引爆了，足足炸了一个小时。
      当卫生员扛来担架，他已经冲到前边去了。他的腿上带着那块弹片又冲杀了五天，直到撤军，才被送到凭祥医院动手术，伤口早就化脓
  了。住了一周医院，又笑嘻嘻地回到了连队。
      ……吴国和负伤的前四个月，西安某兵工厂
  靶场，蒋基凯参加我国一种新枪族的定型试验。作为特邀射手，他是新枪族技术性能的权威鉴定者，是否由这个厂定型生产，就看他的试射效果了。工程师伏在他旁边观测射击情况，一颗心提到了嗓子眼。
    不错，机件灵敏，出弹清脆，枪声的节奏均匀而舒展。工程师渐渐把笑意写到了脸上。忽听“哗啦”一响，枪声中断，枪的机匣盖反弹起来，正好击中蒋基凯的右眼眶。眼前一片金星。
    工程师慌得一把捧住蒋基凯的头：“不打了，不行了，快去医院！”
    蒋基凯用手帕擦掉眼窝边的鲜血，换了一支枪。上弹。
    枪的歌声又响了起来，唱得是那么均匀、舒展。
    新枪族顺利通过。
    罪犯松了一口气，放心地坐了下来，放下对讲机，从桌上的烟盒里抽出一支烟，叼到嘴里，点燃，舒舒服服地喷出了一大口烟雾。
    他已经看到几个法院干部向监狱车间走来。他赢了！他要先小小品尝一下胜利的滋味，然后再……他深深地吸入了第二口烟。
    一声惊雷！两道电光穿过了他的身体。
    他的身子软软地塌下去。一团烟雾从他的嘴巴冉冉溢出，跟着，一串血泡涌了出来……
    女统计员夺门而出。
    管理科长抬腕看表：5点整。
    从第一次瞄准到击毙罪犯，总共5分钟。
    郭宁生朝二楼统计室跑去，武警、狱警早已应声而入。
    蒋基凯、吴国和留在原处，按照射击教范的规定打开枪膛验枪：空膛。只上一发子弹。
    监狱大门前围了一大群人，罪犯被拖放到那里。验明正身的，拍照录像的，维持秩序的，一饱眼福的，都围着这个血淋淋的身体忙碌，比划，咒骂，惊叹……
    他俩没有去看射击效果，绕开看热闹的人群走出了监狱大门，径直向载他们返校的面包车走去。两支狙击步枪亮得很眩目。监狱门口的警卫尊敬地注视着他们：一个套一身军便服，无肩章领花，敞领露胸；一个身穿破旧的黑茄克，脚上趿着一双拖鞋，身上头上到处是石灰浆斑点和灰尘。
      两颗子弹同时击中罪犯。一颗从右耳根钻入，从左额穿出；另一颗从臀右打入，由会阴穿出，子弹碰到大腿骨就炸开了。
    第二天监狱车间照常开工。昨天提早回监舍的犯人又到各自的机床边干活。
    管理科长陪着女统计员绕车间一周。跟原来一模一样，只是右手缠上了纱布。
    不止一个犯人吐了吐舌头。
      回到家里，吴国和继续画一幅画。蒋基凯继续当他的粉刷工……
      人们眼中的风景世界又恢复了平静。
