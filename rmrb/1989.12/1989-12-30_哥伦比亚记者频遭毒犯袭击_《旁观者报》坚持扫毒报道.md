On September 2, terrorists attacked the offices of *El Espectador* newspaper in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. Over 80 staff members were injured, and the internal facilities were severely damaged, with losses amounting to $2.5 million. This bombing incident marked a new phase in Colombia's anti-drug efforts, as ruthless drug traffickers launched a ferocious counterattack.

Due to the U.S. government's announcement of strong support for anti-drug efforts in Latin American countries, drug traffickers who have amassed wealth through drug trafficking have become extremely uneasy. They responded with large-scale terrorist actions against anti-drug efforts. In Colombia alone, more than 200 judges involved in anti-drug operations have been killed by drug traffickers. Journalists who uphold their duties and refuse to back down in the face of danger have also been widely targeted by drug traffickers. Currently, in addition to anti-drug judges and police, journalists have become the third major target of terrorist attacks. Over the past 10 years, the losses in the journalism industry have been severe, with 24 journalists killed, at least 10 of whom were murdered by drug traffickers. To escape such fate, 12 journalists have been forced to flee the country in the past three years. The frequent murders have made journalists realize that anyone can be attacked in this brutal struggle.

For a long time, *El Espectador* has strongly condemned drug use, production, and trafficking. However, this newspaper has paid a heavy price for it. In December 1986, the editor-in-chief, Guillermo Cano Isaza, was shot dead by drug traffickers in front of the newspaper's office; in early this year, the newspaper's legal advisor was assassinated on the street by terrorists on a motorcycle; in April, the newspaper's correspondent in the border city of Leticia was murdered. Given the escalating terrorist activities, the Colombian government has dispatched troops to guard the entrance of this 120-year-old newspaper, checking all suspicious visitors to ensure the safety of the staff.

In the face of danger and difficulties, the editors of *El Espectador*, who uphold justice and are fearless in the face of danger, have not retreated. After the murder of Cano, they adopted some new strategies. They changed the practice of reporting on anti-drug news daily and no longer signed editorials condemning drug traffickers. They continue to use their typewriters as weapons and the newspaper to fight against terrorists relentlessly.

    哥伦比亚记者频遭毒犯袭击  《旁观者报》坚持扫毒报道
    9月2日，哥伦比亚首都波哥大城《旁观者报》办公大楼遭到恐怖分子袭击，有80多位工作人员受伤，内部设施遭到严重破坏，损失多达250万美元。这起爆炸事件标志着哥伦比亚扫毒进入新阶段后，穷凶极恶的贩毒恐怖分子对扫毒进行猖狂反扑。
    由于美国政府宣布大力支持拉美各国扫毒，这使那些通过贩毒而大发横财的贩毒分子极为不安，于是便以大规模的恐怖行动来对付扫毒。仅哥伦比亚就有200多名扫毒的法官死于贩毒分子之手。而那些恪守自己职责，不愿在危险面前止步的新闻记者也普遍遭到贩毒分子的袭击。目前，除了扫毒法官和警察外，新闻记者已成为恐怖分子袭击的第三个主要目标。过去10年中新闻界的损失是惨重的，在被杀害的24位新闻记者中，至少有10位是被贩毒分子谋杀的。为了摆脱这样的遭遇，近三年里有12位新闻工作者被迫流亡国外。接二连三的突发谋杀事件使新闻记者意识到在这场残酷的斗争中谁都有可能遭到袭击。
    很久以来，《旁观者报》就猛烈抨击吸毒、产毒和贩毒，但是这家报纸却因此付出了极大的代价。1986年12月，该报主编吉尔蒙·卡农·艾卡扎在报社门前被贩毒分子枪杀；今年年初，该报法律顾问在街上被骑在摩托上的恐怖分子暗杀；4月，该报在边境城市莱蒂西亚的特派记者被谋害。鉴于日益加剧的恐怖活动，哥伦比亚政府已经派军队到这家具有120年历史的报社门前站岗守卫，查询一切可疑的来访者，以确保报社工作人员的人身安全。
    面对危险和困难，主持正义、临危不惧的《旁观者报》的编辑们没有在困难面前退让，他们在卡农主编遇难后相应地采取了一些新的斗争策略。他们改变了每天报道有关扫毒的消息的作法，而且在对谴责贩毒分子的评论中也不再署编辑名。他们坚持以手中的打字机为武器，利用报纸来对恐怖分子进行不懈斗争。
