Representatives from various circles in Fujian hold grand meeting to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Gutian Conference

GUTIAN, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 representatives gathered in Gutian Town, Shanghang County, today to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Gutian Conference. The participants reviewed the resolution "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas in the Party," drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong in December 1929 and adopted by the Ninth Congress of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. They unanimously agreed that this landmark document in the history of the Party and the army still holds great significance in today's construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

General Xiao Ke, a member of the Central Advisory Commission who participated in the Gutian Conference, traveled from Beijing to attend the meeting and delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Military Commission. He said that the Gutian Conference resolution is a product of its time and a crystallization of collective wisdom. Today, as we review the Gutian Conference resolution, we must "learn from the past and innovate." We should not only inherit but also develop the precious legacy left by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries.

Chen Guangyi, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his speech at the commemoration meeting that today we commemorate the Gutian Conference to strengthen ideological and political work and to actively carry out the Party's ideological struggle.

Some old comrades who had fought in the Minxi Soviet area also spoke. Among them were Chen Pisha, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, and former Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Yang Chengwu.

The commemoration meeting was presided over by Wang Zhaoguo, Governor of Fujian Province.
