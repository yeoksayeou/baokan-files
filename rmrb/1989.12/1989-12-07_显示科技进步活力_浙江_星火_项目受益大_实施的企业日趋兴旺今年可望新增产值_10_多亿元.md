Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 5th. Reporter Gao Haihao reports: The group of enterprises implementing the "Spark Plan" in Zhejiang Province has risen rapidly and is becoming increasingly prosperous, demonstrating the strong vitality of technological progress in the current difficult times.

According to a recent survey by the provincial Science and Technology Commission, among the 735 "Spark" science and technology projects at the municipal and prefecture level that have been put into production, 90% have withstood market fluctuations, with products that are in line with market demand and steadily increasing profits and taxes. According to incomplete statistics, the "Spark Plan" projects in the province are expected to add more than 10 billion yuan in production value and over 2 billion yuan in profits and taxes this year. The export value of 247 "Spark" products is expected to exceed 100 million yuan.

Over the past four years, Zhejiang Province has implemented more than a thousand "Spark" science and technology projects in rural areas. With the strong support of governments at all levels and science and technology, financial, and economic departments, these projects have developed rapidly and achieved significant results, making Zhejiang one of the leading provinces in the national "Spark Plan."

Promoting the integration of three streams of technological talent is a major feature of Zhejiang Province's implementation of the "Spark Plan." First, it attracts and encourages technological workers to actively participate in the "Spark Plan." The province has accumulated more than 3,000 technological personnel involved in the implementation of "Spark" science and technology projects, ensuring that over 90% of the "Spark" project enterprises have technical support from colleges, universities, research institutions, and state-owned large factories. Second, it supports the cultivation of a group of technological entrepreneurs. At the same time, it carries out large-scale "Spark" technology training, enabling 170,000 farmers to be influenced by industrialization and technological knowledge. In the province's more than 1,000 "Spark" project enterprises, over 70% of the workers have undergone on-the-job training, continuously improving the enterprises' technological and management levels and the quality of the workforce.

Another feature of Zhejiang Province's implementation of the "Spark Plan" is the emphasis on adjusting the industrial structure by focusing on the development of new products in series, and strengthening regional pillar industries and full-service systems. The 19 enterprises in the Shaoxing County Keqiao Textile "Spark" Technology Concentration Zone have developed more than 100 new textile products, more than 10 new equipment, and more than 20 new materials in two years, making the profit rate here more than double the county's average. Currently, the province has 50 "Spark" projects with production values exceeding 10 million yuan and profits and taxes exceeding 1 million yuan, initially forming 30 "Spark" technology concentration zones and industrial development groups. A batch of technology-led rural industrial full-service systems have emerged.

    显示科技进步活力
    浙江“星火”项目受益大
    实施的企业日趋兴旺今年可望新增产值10多亿元
    本报杭州12月5日电　记者高海浩报道：浙江省实施“星火计划”的企业群体异军突起、日趋兴旺，在当前共渡难关中，显示了科技进步的强劲活力。
    据省科委新近的一项调查表明，业已投产的735个市、地级以上“星火”科技项目中，90％经受了市场波动的考验，产品适销对路，利税稳步递增。据不完全统计，全省“星火计划”项目今年可望新增产值10多亿元、利税2亿多元，247项“星火”产品出口额预计突破1亿元。
    在过去的4年间，浙江省农村先后实施了千余个“星火”科技项目，在各级政府和科技、金融、经济部门的大力扶持下发展迅速，成效显著，成为全国“星火计划”发展领先的省份之一。
    推动3股科技人才流的融合，这是浙江省实施“星火计划”的一大特点。首先是吸引鼓励科技工作者积极参与“星火计划”，全省累计已有3000余名科技人员投身“星火”科技项目的实施，使90％以上的“星火”项目承担企业拥有大专院校、科研单位和国营大厂的技术依托；其次是扶持造就一批以科技实业家为代表的人才流。与此同时，开展大规模“星火”技术培训，使17万人次的农民受到工业化和科技知识的熏陶，全省千余个“星火”项目承担企业中，70％以上的职工进行上岗培训，使企业技术、管理水平和职工素质不断提高。
    浙江省推行“星火计划”的另一个特点是：突出以系列开发新产品为导向调整产业结构，强化区域性支柱产业和全程服务体系。绍兴县柯桥纺织星火技术密集区的19家企业，两年开发纺织新产品100多种、新装备10多种、新原料20多种，使这里的利润率比全县平均水平高出1倍以上。目前，全省已有50个“星火”项目产值上千万、利税过百万，初步形成了30个“星火”技术密集区和产业开发集团，一批科技主导型的农村产业全程服务体系应运而起。
