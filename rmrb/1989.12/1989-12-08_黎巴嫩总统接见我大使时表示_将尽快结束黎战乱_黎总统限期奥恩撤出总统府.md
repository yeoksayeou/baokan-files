Lebanese President Elias Hrawi today stated that he will exert every effort to end Lebanon's civil war as soon as possible and achieve peace and stability.

Hrawi made the remarks this morning when he received Chinese Ambassador Yang Yi-huai at his temporary command post in the Abra camp in eastern Lebanon.

This was the first time Hrawi, who was elected president, met with the Chinese ambassador. He said he attaches great importance to the friendship between Lebanon and China and hopes that this friendship will continue to be strengthened and developed.

Lebanese President Hrawi told reporters today that he has given Christian leader Elie Hobeika two weeks to evacuate the Baabda presidential palace, or else he will take action.

He revealed that the new commander-in-chief, General Emile Lahoud, is leading Muslim militias in urgent deployments.

Hrawi had previously sent a letter to 20 Arab heads of state on December 4th, seeking their help to end Hobeika's "rebellion."

On December 6th, near the "Green Line" in the eastern and southeastern mountainous regions of the capital Beirut, Hobeika's forces and Syrian-backed Muslim militias entered their second day of intense fighting. One of Hobeika's lieutenants was killed.
