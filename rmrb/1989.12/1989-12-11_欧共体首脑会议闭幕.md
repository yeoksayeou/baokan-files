The 42nd European Community Summit concluded today after making a series of resolutions on European economic integration and political cooperation.

Regarding the two main topics discussed at this meeting—the European Economic and Monetary Union and the "Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers" (referred to as the Social Charter), due to Britain's persistent opposition, only 11 countries reached a resolution. This is the first time that the Community Summit has made a resolution with a member country voting against it.

The meeting decided to convene an intergovernmental conference by the end of next year to draft a new treaty for the implementation of the second phase of the European Economic and Monetary Union (i.e., the establishment of the European Central Bank system) and decided to discuss the preparation of the intergovernmental conference at the next Council meeting in the first half of next year.

Except for Britain, the other 11 member countries of the Community agreed to sign the Social Charter. The statement issued at the end of the meeting said that the Social Charter, which includes 26 articles, expresses the "new model of social relations" that the Community countries advocate, "based on common traditions and practices."

This meeting discussed the situation in Eastern Europe and decided to establish the "Bank for the Development of Eastern Europe" and set up a training fund for personnel from Eastern European countries. The meeting also decided to agree to the Soviet Union participating in the activities of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as an observer.

The 12 heads of state, after discussing European political cooperation, issued separate statements on issues related to Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Southern Africa, and Latin America.

According to the conference chairman's spokesperson, Hubert Vedrine, the conference, at the request of West German Chancellor Kohl, after a lengthy and heated debate, decided to include the "right of the German people to self-determination" in the conference documents, but at the same time emphasized that the process of German unification "must be realized through peaceful and democratic means, must be based on the observance of various treaties, and the principles set out in the Helsinki (CSCE) Final Act, and must be carried out in the context of East-West dialogue and cooperation." The chairman of this European Council, French President Mitterrand, declared at the press conference after the meeting that the meeting was a success, and the number and scope of the issues discussed and decided at this meeting were unprecedented in previous meetings.

The European Council—also known as the Community Summit—meets every half year, with the chairmanship rotating among the 12 countries of the Community. The chairman of the next Council will be Ireland.

    欧共体首脑会议闭幕
    新华社斯特拉斯堡12月9日电　（记者郭京花）第42届欧洲共同体首脑会议就欧洲经济一体化建设和政治合作问题作出一系列决议后，今天中午在这里闭幕。
    关于本次会议讨论的两个主要议题——欧洲经济货币联盟和“劳动者基本社会权利共同体宪章”（简称社会宪章），由于英国坚持反对态度，只形成了11国决议。这是共同体首脑会议首次在有成员国投反对票的情况下作出决议。
    会议决定明年年底以前召开政府间会议，就欧洲经济货币联盟第二阶段（即建立欧洲中央银行系统）的实施制定新的条约，并决定明年上半年在下届理事会上讨论政府间会议的准备情况。
    除英国之外的共同体其他11个成员国同意签署社会宪章。会议结束时发表的声明说，包括26项条款的社会宪章表达了共同体国家所推崇的“来自共同的传统与实践的新的社会关系模式。”
    这次会议讨论了东欧局势，决定成立“东欧发展地区银行”，并建立东欧国家人员培训基金。会议还决定同意苏联以观察员身份参加关贸总协定的活动。
    12国首脑在讨论欧洲政治合作问题后，就中欧和东欧问题，中东问题，南部非洲问题和拉丁美洲问题等分别发表了声明。
    据大会主席发言人于贝尔·韦德里纳透露，大会根据西德总理科尔的要求，经过长时间激烈的争论，决定将“德国人民的自由自决权”写入会议文件中，但同时强调，德国的统一进程“必须通过和平民主的方式实现，必须建立在遵守各种条约，遵守赫尔辛基（欧安会）最后文件中规定的原则基础上，在东西方对话和合作的背景下进行”。本届欧洲理事会执行主席法国总统密特朗在会议结束后的记者招待会上宣称，会议取得了成功，会议讨论和决定的问题之多和范围之广都是历届会议无法比拟的。
    欧洲理事会——即共同体首脑会议每半年举行一次，主席由共同体12国轮流担任，下届理事会主席是爱尔兰。
