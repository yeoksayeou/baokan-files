Title: Such a "Just Cause"

The United States dispatched over 20,000 troops from its domestic bases and military installations in Panama to launch the largest military operation since the Vietnam War. This blatant act of armed aggression, which had been planned for several months, was shamelessly given the codename "Just Cause," which is a great irony.

Look at the consequences of this "Just Cause" over the past 10 days:

- Under the relentless bombing and artillery fire of the U.S. military, the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces was reduced to rubble, and thousands of military personnel became "prisoners" of the U.S. Many civilian homes were destroyed, and more than 5,000 Panamanians were displaced.

- The U.S. military chose to attack densely populated urban areas in the dead of night, resulting in the massacre of many innocent civilians, including numerous elderly people, women, and children. According to the obviously understated figures released by the U.S., over 300 Panamanians were killed, and the number of injured is countless.

- The U.S. military conducted widespread arrests of former Panamanian government officials and military officers, and some of them were taken to the United States.

- The U.S. military shot and killed Juan Antonio, a photographer from Spain's *El País*, and injured several other foreign journalists. Some foreign journalists were also subjected to personal insults. U.S. tanks and armed personnel surrounded the embassies of Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Vatican in Panama. Even more outrageous was that the U.S. military brazenly occupied the residence of the Nicaraguan ambassador to Panama, an unprecedented act in international relations.

And so on. In short, under U.S. occupation, Panama's national sovereignty was wantonly trampled, the basic rights of the Panamanian people were severely violated, the basic principles of international law were brutally violated, and the purposes and principles of the *United Nations Charter* were long forgotten. Is this what the United States advocates and practices as a "just cause"? The so-called "justice" of the United States is actually a euphemism for hegemony, where the use of force is used to impose its will on others. They claim to uphold democracy, freedom, and human rights, but in reality, they practice unadulterated power politics.

To give the "Just Cause" a "legal" stamp, some Americans even went so far as to argue that the U.S. intervention in Panama was based on Article 51 of the *United Nations Charter*, which grants the right to "self-defense." This is sheer nonsense. According to the provisions of this article, any member state of the United Nations, when subjected to armed attack, has the right to "individual or collective self-defense" until the Security Council takes necessary measures to maintain international peace and security. In fact, this article has nothing to do with the U.S. military invasion of Panama. The U.S. claim of "self-defense" is merely a shield for its hegemony, aimed at protecting its strategic interests in the Panama Canal Zone.

The U.S. "Just Cause" has brought immense suffering to the people of Panama. "Justice," "justice," how many evil deeds have been committed in your name! But falsehoods will always be exposed. Latin American countries have long known from their own painful experiences what the "just cause" of Washington is all about.

    如此“正义事业”
    管彦忠
    美国从本土和驻巴拿马的军事基地出动了2万多军队，对巴拿马发动了自越南战争以来规模最大的军事行动。这项策划了几个月的公然武装侵略的行动，居然堂而皇之地被冠以“正义事业行动”的代号，真是莫大的讽刺。
    请看10天来，这一“正义事业行动”的后果：
    ——在美军的狂轰滥炸和炮火猛烈攻击之下，巴拿马国防军司令部大楼被夷为一片废墟，数千国防军官兵成了美军的“俘虏”。许多民房被毁，5000多巴拿马人流离失所。
    ——美军选择夜深人静时袭击人口密集市区，大批无辜的居民包括很多老人、妇女和儿童惨遭杀戮。按美方公布的显然缩小了的数字，也有300多巴拿马人丧生，伤者更是无计其数。
    ——美军大肆搜捕巴拿马前政府官员和国防军军官，并把其中一些人押往美国。
    ——美军开枪打死了西班牙《国家报》摄影记者胡安·安东尼奥，打伤了另外几个外国记者。还有一些外国记者遭到人身污辱。美军的坦克和武装人员包围了古巴、尼加拉瓜、梵蒂冈驻巴拿马的使馆。更令人愤慨的是，美国军队竟然蛮横地占领了尼加拉瓜驻巴拿马大使的官邸，这种无法无天的举动在国际关系中实属罕见。
    如此等等。总之，在美军占领下，巴拿马的国家主权被肆意践踏，巴拿马人民的基本权利横遭蹂躏，国际法的基本准则被粗暴破坏，《联合国宪章》的宗旨和原则早已被抛到九霄云外。这一切难道就是美国所鼓吹和实行的“正义事业”吗？美国的所谓“正义”，原来就是以武力干涉来把自己的意志强加于人的霸权主义的代名词，他们口口声声自称崇尚所谓民主、自由、人权，实际干的却是不折不扣的强权政治。
    为了给“正义事业行动”打上“合法”的标记，美国某些人还煞有介事地辩解说，美国出兵巴拿马是根据《联合国宪章》第51条行使“自卫权”，这完全是无稽之谈。按照该条文的规定，联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时，在安理会采取必要办法以维持国际和平及安全以前，可以“行使单独或集体自卫之自然权利”。事实上，这一条同美国军事入侵巴拿马根本搭不上边。美国所谓的“自卫”之说，正是为了维护它在巴拿马运河区的战略利益，这种“自卫权”不过是霸权主义的护身符。
    美国的“正义事业行动”已使巴拿马人民受尽磨难。“正义”，“正义”，多少恶行假汝之名以行。但是，假的终究是假的。拉美国家从切身痛苦经历中早已体验到华盛顿的“正义事业行动”是什么货色。
