The small town is a ridge, and circling the ridge is a river. The small town is like a large ship, floating on the water. On the water, there are also real ships: fishing boats, sand boats, and in recent years, motorized sailboats. In the middle of the river is a sandbank, where crops can be grown, and reeds, mugwort, and various wildflowers bloom in clusters, swaying gently in the wind, looking very beautiful. The elders say that this is because the river is a good one, like ginseng soup. Therefore, every Dragon Boat Festival, the men, women, and children of the small town come to the riverbank to wash their eyes, and then pick some reeds and mugwort to take back home, inserting them into the doorframe to ward off evil and misfortune.

Once again, it is a Dragon Boat Festival morning. As the first light of dawn breaks over the horizon, and the sun slowly ascends to the zenith, the crowd on the riverbank is endless. Several dozen small boats carrying tourists set off together, like arrows leaving the bow. The paddles flipping in the air splash up a spray of water, glistening in the morning light, like jumping pearls, making the young men laugh heartily and the girls scream with delight. When the boats reach the middle of the river, they stop paddling, allowing the small boats to sway gently. The people on the boats lean over the sides, using their hands, handkerchiefs, or a small stalk of grass picked up on the way, to splash water on their faces and eyes. The water is cool and refreshing, making one's body tense and then relax, dispelling any lingering sleepiness and making the mind exceptionally clear and active. The eyes also seem much brighter than usual.

After washing their eyes, the small boats slowly move forward again. The river water is like a long harp that can be played, and now the paddles are plucking its strings, making the melody of the river flow even more melodious, prolonged, and profound. At this time, there will be one or two people who slowly begin to talk, telling the story of Qu Yuan and the customs that have been passed down to this day. Those who are well-traveled will also talk about the dragon boat races in the south and the realgar wine...

On the sandbank, they pick some reeds and mugwort, and then pick a handful of wildflowers, and stand still to look towards the opposite shore. They see that the hometown small town, surrounded by green water and green trees, is extraordinarily beautiful. The exposed yellow corner is the county government's office building; the small red light hanging high in the distance is the newly built television tower; and the rising smoke from the cooking fires is simply a familiar memory, a loving call from relatives. Another small boat comes, "treu" it moors at the shore, dropping off a new batch of people on the sandbank and taking away those who came early...

Around eight o'clock, the tourists gradually disappear. So the old man also stops his boat. He has fished on this river for decades, catching countless fish, and he can't count how many people he has ferried to wash their eyes and pick reeds on Dragon Boat Festival. He squints his eyes, looking at the river surface shimmering with a layer of mist under the sun, and the now quiet riverbank. He is waiting for his wife, who brings him lunch every day.

Two little girls quietly walk over, wearing flowery clothes that look thin, shivering slightly in the chilly May wind of the north. The slightly older girl says:
"Grandpa, we came from the countryside. I want to wash my sister's eyes. Please take us over, okay?"

Ah, the girl is leading her blind sister. The blind sister, hearing her sister's words, is hiding behind her, smiling shyly, her eyes gazing blankly at a place that others cannot see.

The girl continues to plead innocently, and the old man has already turned his boat sideways to the shore, helping the girl get her blind sister onto the boat.

The small boat makes a sound, breaking the silence of the riverbank, and heads towards the middle of the river.

On the boat, the innocent little girl tells the old man that they walked 20 miles to get here. She asks the old man: Can this river water really make one's heart pure and eyes bright? Can it cure her little sister's eyes?

When the boat reaches the middle of the river, in the slow and clear water, the old man stops paddling, using an anchor to steady the small boat, and says to the sisters: "Wash, wash your eyes and your heart, and your heart will be pure and your eyes will be bright."

The little girl bends down, leaning over the side of the boat, scooping up a handful of water, gently splashing it on her blind sister's eyes. Her expression is so solemn, and the water flows down her wrist, wetting her sleeves. The blind sister, still smiling shyly, reaches out her hand to touch the water, carefully wiping it on her sister's face. The old man suddenly feels his eyes welling up, turns his head, and coughs, pulling up the anchor.

The river's harp is still playing without pause, telling an ancient story, a moving legend, depicting and sculpting an immortal soul... And the strings of the harp, plucked by the boat paddle, splash up a few flying notes, like the splashing water, falling on people, seeping into their hearts...

When the small boat returns to the shore, more than an hour has passed, and the old woman holding the lunch box is already waiting on the shore. The little girl thanks the old man and gets off the boat. The blind sister leans over to her sister and says something, and the sister walks over to pick up a bundle of reeds and wildflowers from the sandbank, inserting them into the bow of the old man's boat. The old man smiles slightly, smelling a faint grassy fragrance.

The old woman chattering, leaves the food and walks away. The old man pushes the boat out again, pushing it to the middle of the river and dropping the anchor. The small town is not far from him, and the sandbank is not far from him. All around is water, shimmering with the light of the water. He takes out the two bundles of grass, brushing them on his face. He feels two dew drops falling on his face, cool and ticklish, very comfortable. He picks a flexible reed, tying the two bundles of reeds and wildflowers together, and throws them into the river, watching them bobbing towards the place where the sun is most brilliant.

    河水唱着的故事
    张玉芬
    小镇是个坎，绕坎是条江，小镇就像只大船，浮在水上。水上还有真的船：渔船、沙船，近年又有了机帆船。水中间是沙渚，渚上可以种庄稼，长蒲草、苇子、香蒿，各种各样的星星点点的野花满渚开着，随风袅娜煞是好看。老人们说，这都因为这是一条好水呢，是人参汤。因此，每年端午节，小镇上的男女老少都到江边来洗眼睛，再采些蒲草、香蒿带回去，插到门楣上，以求驱邪避祸。
    又是一个端午节的早晨，从天边刚绽出一抹清光，到太阳款款步上中天，江岸上的人群络绎不绝。几十只小船载着游人一起离岸竞发，像一根根离弦的箭。翻飞的双桨，溅起了一朵朵水花，在晨光下，闪着灿灿的幽凉，跳珠一般蹦到船上，惹得小伙子们哈哈大笑，姑娘们高声尖叫。船到江心，却停了桨，任小船轻轻地扭摆。船里的人们伏在船舷上，用手、手帕或上船时摘的一株小草，往脸上眼上撩水，那水清凉凉的，不禁使人浑身一紧、一爽，因为早起而有的一点睡意顿然消失，头脑变得异常清醒与活跃，那眼睛也真觉得比往日清亮了许多。
    洗完了眼睛，小船又悠悠地前进了。江水本来就是一把会弹奏的长琴，现在船桨又拨动了它的琴弦，使这一支江流的曲子愈发动听，也愈发绵长而又深沉。这时候，也会有那么一两个人慢慢地讲起来，讲屈原，讲延续至今的这种习俗。有那见多识广的还要讲一讲南方的竞龙舟、雄黄酒……
    到了沙渚上，采了一阵蒲草、香蒿，再摘一把野花，然后站定了往对岸望去。只见绿水包围着、绿树环遮着的家乡小镇竟是异常美丽。那隐露着的黄色的一角，是县政府的办公大楼；遥遥的像悬在半空的一盏小红灯，是新建的电视塔；至于那舒卷着悄然升起来的炊烟，简直就是一个熟悉的回忆，亲人殷殷的呼唤了。又有小船来了，“悠”地一声靠了岸，把一批新来的人搁在沙渚上，把早来的人们接走了……
    将近八点多钟，游人渐渐绝了迹。于是老汉也歇了船。他在这条江上打渔几十年了，打了多少鱼他数不清，端午节运送过多少洗眼睛采蒲草的人他也数不清。他眯细着眼睛望了望被太阳照得起了一层水雾的江面，望了望变得冷清的江岸。他在等他的老太婆，她每天给他送饭来。
    一对小女孩不知什么时候悄悄走过来，她们穿着花衣衫，显得很单薄，在北方五月还很凉的江风里微微打着哆嗦。那个稍大一点的女孩子说：
    “爷爷，我们是从乡下赶来的，我要给妹妹洗眼睛。求求您把我们送过去吧。”
    啊，这女孩子牵着的竟是她的盲妹。盲妹听了姐姐的话，正往姐姐的身后躲，羞怯地笑着，一双眼睛茫然地注视着一个别人看不见的地方。
    女孩子还在天真地央求，老人早把船打横靠在岸边，帮着女孩子把盲妹扶上了船。
    小船磕然一声敲破江边的寂静，向江心驶去。
    船上，天真的小姑娘告诉老人，她们是赶了20里路来的。又问老人：这江水真能使人心清眼亮吗？能治好她小妹的眼睛么？
    船到江心，在流缓水清的地方，老人停了桨，用锚把小船稳住，对那姐妹说：“洗吧，洗眼睛洗心，心清眼亮。”
    小姑娘弯身趴在船舷上，掏起一捧水，往盲妹的眼上轻轻地撩，神态那么庄重，水顺手腕流下来，把衣袖都弄湿了。那盲妹呢，仍羞怯地笑着，把手试探地伸到船外，沾了一点水，小心地在她姐姐脸上摸索。老人突然觉得眼睛发潮，回过头去咳了一声，拔起了锚。
    那江水的琴还在不歇地奏着，诉说着一个古老的故事，一个动人的传说，描摹、塑造着一个不朽的灵魂……而被船桨拨动了的琴弦呢，溅起了几个飞动的音符，像那溅起的水花，落到人的身上，钻进去，钻到人心里去了……
    小船回到岸边的时候，一个多小时过去了，捧着饭盒的老太婆早已等在岸边。小姑娘向老人道谢一声下了船。盲妹伏在姐姐耳边说了句什么，姐姐走过来把她在沙渚上采来的蒲草、野花分出一束，插在老人的船头。老人微微笑了，他闻到了一股淡淡的草的清香。
    老太婆叨叨着，留下饭菜走了。老人又把船撑起，撑到江心抛了锚。小镇在他不远的地方，沙渚在他不远的地方，四周都是水，晃漾着水的光辉。他拔出那两束野草，在脸上拂了拂，他觉得落在他脸上两颗露珠，凉凉的，痒痒的，舒服极了。他拣了一根柔韧的蒲草，把两束蒲草连同野花捆扎在一起，投入江心，看它起伏着向那阳光最绚烂的地方去了。
