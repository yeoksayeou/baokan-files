Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, December 29th.

Latin American countries have issued a statement condemning the U.S. military's violations of diplomatic privileges in Panama. Recently, the occupying U.S. forces have employed various tactics, including a "rock and roll warfare" strategy against the Vatican's embassy in Panama, making Manuel Noriega, who sought refuge inside, feel besieged on all sides. The U.S. military also kidnapped the Cuban ambassador and occupied the Nicaraguan embassy. Latin American countries have therefore issued a statement condemning the U.S. military's violations of diplomatic privileges.

After Noriega entered the Vatican embassy, the U.S. military initially surrounded it with tanks and armored vehicles. Starting the day before yesterday, they set up directional loudspeakers around the embassy, blasting deafening rock music all day, interspersed with broadcasts attacking Noriega. Some Panamanians also gathered outside the embassy to protest against Noriega. It is believed that this is part of the U.S. military's psychological warfare against Noriega. The U.S. military also allowed those who entered the Vatican embassy with Noriega to leave, aiming to isolate Noriega to the greatest extent possible.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military illegally kidnapped the Cuban ambassador to Panama yesterday (December 28th) and then illegally occupied the Nicaraguan embassy and the ambassador's residence in Panama for three hours today. A Nicaraguan diplomat stated that after the U.S. military withdrew, thousands of dollars in cash from the embassy had also disappeared. As of this evening, the U.S. side has not provided any explanation for this action. Therefore, the Nicaraguan military has been put on the highest alert.

The Mexican Foreign Ministry also issued a statement this evening, declaring that the "Rio Group" consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Mexico are seriously concerned about the U.S. military's various actions violating diplomatic privileges in Panama. They believe that the U.S. military's actions against the Vatican and other countries' embassies in Panama violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and trample on international legal norms. They strongly demand that the United States respect the international regulations that diplomatic missions are inviolable.

    拉美国家发表声明
    谴责美军在巴侵犯外交特权
    本报墨西哥城12月29日电　记者郭伟成报道：近日来，美国占领军花样翻新，对梵蒂冈驻巴拿马使馆进行“摇滚乐战术”，令藏身内里的诺列加感到四面楚歌。美军并连续劫持古巴大使及占领尼加拉瓜大使馆。拉美国家因此声明，谴责美军侵犯外交特权。
    诺列加进入梵蒂冈使馆后，美军先以坦克、装甲车重兵包围。从前天开始，又在周围架设定向高音喇叭，整日以最强音播放令人震耳欲聋的摇滚乐，穿插对诺列加进行攻击的广播。一些巴拿马人也到使馆外向诺列加示威。据认为，这是美军对诺列加进行“心理战”。美军并允许随同诺列加进入梵蒂冈使馆的人员撤出，以便最大限度地孤立诺列加。
    与此同时，美军昨天（28日）非法劫持古巴驻巴拿马大使后，又于今天下午非法占领尼加拉瓜驻巴拿马大使馆及大使官邸长达3小时之久。尼加拉瓜外交官说，美军撤出后，馆内数千美元现金亦不翼而飞。截止今晚，美国方面没有对此行为作出任何解释。因此，尼加拉瓜军队已经进入最高戒备状态。
    墨西哥外交部也于今晚发表新闻公报，声明组成“里约热内卢集团”的阿根廷、巴西、哥伦比亚、秘鲁、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉及墨西哥7国对美军在巴拿马侵犯外交特权的种种行为表示严重不安。认为美军对梵蒂冈及其他国家驻巴拿马使馆的所作所为，侵犯了维也纳国际外交公约，粗暴地践踏了国际法准则，强烈要求美国尊重外交使团不可侵犯的国际规定。
