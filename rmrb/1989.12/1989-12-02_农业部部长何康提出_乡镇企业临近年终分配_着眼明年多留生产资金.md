	The People's Daily, Beijing, December 1 — Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yanbin and People's Daily reporter Chen Jian report: This year, township enterprises are facing a shortage of funds, which has affected their production and development. Minister of Agriculture He Kang has urged all regions to: as the year-end distribution approaches, township enterprises should distribute less and retain more, preparing more funds for next year's production needs.

	He Kang said at the national agricultural comprehensive development experience exchange meeting convened by the State Council that currently, township enterprises are facing many difficulties, the most significant of which are a shortage of funds and a sluggish market. It is estimated that this year, more than 3 million township enterprises will be closed or merged, and 8 million enterprise employees will leave their jobs and return to their hometowns for work. Many enterprises, due to a severe lack of production funds, have seen their economic benefits significantly decline compared to the same period last year. Therefore, He Kang requires township enterprises to leverage their flexible mechanisms, fully utilize the opportunity of rectification and reorganization, and actively explore the market. In terms of funds, they should rely on self-reliance, find ways to improve the turnover rate of funds, and use the limited funds for production. They should carry forward the spirit of hard work and thrift, and deeply and persistently carry out the "double increase and double savings" activities, strictly controlling non-production construction and non-production expenditures. Now that the end of the year is approaching, it is a critical period for the profit distribution of township enterprises. It is essential to distribute less and retain more, and to reserve special funds according to regulations to maintain normal production.

    农业部部长何康提出
    乡镇企业临近年终分配  着眼明年多留生产资金
    本报北京12月1日讯　新华社记者王言彬、本报记者陈健报道：今年乡镇企业资金短缺，生产发展受到影响。农业部部长何康吁请各地：临近年终分配，乡镇企业要少分多留，多准备明年的生产所需资金。
    何康在国务院召开的全国农业综合开发经验交流会上说，目前乡镇企业发展面临许多困难，最主要的是资金短缺、市场疲软。预计全年有300多万家乡镇企业关停并转，有800万企业职工离厂、返乡务工。许多企业由于生产资金严重不足，经济效益比去年同期明显下降。为此，何康要求乡镇企业要发挥机制灵活的优势，充分利用治理整顿的机遇，积极开拓市场。在资金上，要立足于自力更生，想办法提高资金周转率，把有限的资金用到生产上来。要发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的精神，深入持久地开展双增双节活动，严格控制非生产性建设、非生产性开支。现在已近年底，是乡镇企业利润分配的关键时期，一定要少分多留，专项提留要按规定留足留够，以维持正常生产。
