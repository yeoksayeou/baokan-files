From December 2nd to 3rd, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union will hold an informal meeting in Malta, a southern European island nation known as the "heart of the Mediterranean."

In recent days, officials from the United States and the Soviet Union, security personnel, and journalists from around the world have been arriving in Malta in droves, making the capital city of Valletta, with a population of only 25,000, suddenly bustling. According to reports, approximately 2,000 journalists are covering the summit, nearly three times the total number of soldiers in the Maltese national army.

The Mediterranean Conference Center, a historic building with over 400 years of history, was damaged by war during World War II but has since been restored and is now being used as the accommodation for the delegations and the press center. Additionally, a mobile telephone center has been established for use during the summit.

Malta's Prime Minister, Adami, recently stated in a television address that this summit provides Malta with "an opportunity to contribute to the world's peace process." For Malta, where tourism accounts for a significant portion of national income, this U.S.-Soviet summit presents an opportunity to improve tourism facilities and expand the tourism industry.

Malta is located in the central Mediterranean and serves as a strategic point for the Atlantic's access to the eastern Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The country consists of five islands, with Malta Island being the largest. The total area is 316 square kilometers, with a population of 380,000. Malta has a warm climate, and its roads are extensive, making tourism a major source of national income.

Historically, Malta has been occupied by Arabs and Normans. In 1814, it became a British colony. On September 21, 1964, it declared independence. In 1979, it became a republic and a member of the Commonwealth.

Since its independence in 1964, Malta has pursued a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, emphasizing the development of economic relations with Western European countries. Currently, Malta has established diplomatic relations with 89 countries, including China.

    地中海心脏——马耳他
    从12月2日至3日，美苏两国领导人将在素有“地中海心脏”之称的欧洲南部岛国马耳他举行非正式会晤。
    连日来，筹备首脑会晤的美苏官员、保安人员以及来自世界各地的新闻记者等陆续涌入马耳他，使只有2.5万人口的首都瓦莱塔一下子热闹起来。据报道，前去采访首脑会晤的记者约2000人，几乎是马耳他全国军队总数的3倍。
    具有400多年历史的纪念性建筑物——地中海议会中心，在第二次世界大战期间曾遭战火破坏，现已修葺一新，被辟为代表团下榻处和新闻中心。此外，一个活动电话中心也已经建成，供会晤期间使用。
    马耳他总理阿达米最近在电视讲话中表示，这次首脑会晤使马耳他“有机会为世界和平进程尽微薄之力”。同时，对于旅游业在国民收入中占很大比重的马耳他来说，这次美苏首脑会晤可为其改善旅游设施，扩大旅游事业提供一个良机。
    马耳他位于地中海中部，是大西洋通往地中海东部和印度洋的交通要塞。全国由5个岛屿组成，其中以马耳他岛最大；总面积为316平方公里，人口38万。马耳他气候温暖、岛上公路四通八达，旅游业是其国民经济收入的主要来源之一。
    在历史上马耳他曾先后被阿拉伯人、诺尔曼人占领，1814年沦为英国殖民地。1964年9月21日宣布独立。1979年成为共和国，为英联邦成员国。
    马耳他自1964年独立以来奉行中立和不结盟政策，重视同西欧国家发展经济关系。目前，马耳他已同包括中国在内的89个国家建立了外交关系。            　新华社记者　陈晓春
