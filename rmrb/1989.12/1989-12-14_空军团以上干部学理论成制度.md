The Xinhua News Agency's reporter Sun Maoqing reports: On the 13th, it was learned from the ongoing Air Force Party Committee meeting that this year, the Air Force has held 282 sessions of study classes for political commissars (directors) of military-level units and above, and for officers at the regiment level and above, training 8,800 people.

The Air Force has insisted for 11 years on holding study classes for officers at the regiment level and above, training 280,000 people.

To strengthen the theoretical study of flight personnel, the Air Force has assigned full-time political theory teachers to all aviation regiments. Various levels of party committees consciously place the theoretical study of officers at the regiment level and above in an important position. They insist on attendance records, exchanging thoughts, thematic discussions, writing articles, and inspections and evaluations of learning.

The Air Force Party Committee's standing committee's study group has insisted on a half-day study session every week since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The Air Force also insists on holding one study class per year for political commissars (directors) of military-level units and above.
