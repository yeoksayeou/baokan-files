A powerful car bomb exploded in front of the Colombian National Security Department building in Bogotá on the morning of the 6th, resulting in the deaths of forty people and injuring nearly a thousand. However, the director of the Security Department, General Masa, once again escaped unharmed.

Experts estimate that the car bomb, which exploded at 7:35 AM, contained at least 500 kilograms of explosives. The blast created a crater over five meters deep and several meters wide. Five nearby buildings were severely damaged, and fifteen cars were reduced to scrap metal. At the time of the explosion, General Masa had already reached his office on the ninth floor of the building. The ceiling of his office collapsed, and a female secretary was killed.

So far, no organization has claimed responsibility for the explosion. However, the police believe it was definitely the work of drug trafficking groups.

    哥伦比亚安全总局遭炸弹袭击
    一颗威力巨大的汽车炸弹六日早晨在波哥大市哥伦比亚安全总局大楼前爆炸，造成四十人死亡，近千人受伤。但安全总局局长马萨将军再次幸免于难。
    据专家估计，在早晨七点三十五分爆炸的这一汽车炸弹至少有五百公斤以上的炸药。炸弹炸出一个五米多深，十几米宽的大坑，附近五座大楼遭到严重破坏，十五辆汽车被炸成废铁。爆炸发生时，马萨将军已到达总局大楼第九层的办公室。他的办公室天花板被震落，一位女秘书被砸死。
    目前还没有任何组织表示对爆炸事件负责。但警方认为这肯定是贩毒集团干的。            （本报专电）
