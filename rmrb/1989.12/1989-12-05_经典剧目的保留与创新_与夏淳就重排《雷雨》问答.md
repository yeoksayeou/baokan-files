The preservation and innovation of classic plays – a conversation with Xia Chun on restaging "Thunderstorm"

Xia Chun is a colleague and disciple of Mr. Jiao Juhui. He has co-directed plays such as "Teahouse" and is now a veteran of the Beijing People's Art Theatre. The youngest actor in the original Beijing People's Art Theatre production of "Thunderstorm" is now over fifty. How can this classic work of Chinese drama, this tree of artistic life on the stage, remain evergreen?

Reporter: Mr. Xia, is the Beijing People's Art Theatre restaging "Thunderstorm" because there are no good plays to perform and you have to dig into the archives?

Xia Chun: No. The Beijing People's Art Theatre is staging "Thunderstorm" primarily for the following reasons. First, as a top-tier theatre in our country, the Beijing People's Art Theatre should have as rich a repertoire of classic plays as possible for audiences to enjoy. In recent years, we have staged "Foreign Mahjong," "Mutiny," and a batch of excellent foreign plays, as well as new plays like "Dog Grandpa's Rebirth" and "The First Restaurant in the World." In contrast, we have performed classic plays like "Thunderstorm" relatively less frequently. In foreign countries, the works of Shakespeare, Chekhov, Schiller, and O'Neill are perennial favorites in their home theatres. In fact, continuously excavating the treasures of classic works from one's own nation, and deeply and freshly interpreting their content, is also an important means of carrying forward national culture. Therefore, we envision that in the future, while staging new plays and foreign works, we will also stage one or two classic plays each year. "Thunderstorm" is the first step in realizing this vision.

Secondly, modern plays are closer to the actors' lives, and the emotions of the roles are relatively easier to experience. Actors on stage sometimes do not even need to change their daily mannerisms. However, excellent classic plays can train our young actors in various aspects. In this staging of "Thunderstorm," most of the actors in the troupe are young.

Reporter: Many audience members may have seen "Thunderstorm" more than once and are very familiar with the script. How can such a classic play be reimagined to remain appealing?

Xia: This depends on the director and actors' innovative stage treatments in their recreations. An excellent play provides directors and actors with a broad space for artistic interpretation. The same role, even the same action, can be performed with strikingly different brilliance by some excellent actors. The same is true for directors. Those who understand theatre know that the charm of a play lies mainly on the stage. A good play can be endlessly varied. Of course, reading the script is another kind of enjoyment, but it is still different from watching a play in the theatre.

Reporter: What are the differences between this restaging of "Thunderstorm" and previous ones?

Xia: In the past, when performing "Thunderstorm," directors were influenced by the idea of class struggle, often starting from a preconceived notion, making some character relationships too direct and simple. This time, I require that each role in the play be treated as a concrete "person," deeply exploring each character's background and experiences, and thus accurately grasping their personality. For example, with Mei Fanni, we imagine her coming from a declining old literary family in Suzhou. Her father doted on her, hoping she would marry someone with status and position, teaching her music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. She also has some cultural and artistic talent. Before marrying Zhou Puyao, she was already an old maid, a bit too good for some and not good enough for others. Zhou Puyao had status and experience, which suited her intentions, but she found that she had married the wrong person. In her life, she rarely encountered men, which led her to dangerously choose Zhou Ping and find true love in him for the first time. Regarding Zhou Puyao, in the past, he was simply portrayed as a product of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society, emphasizing his cruelty and tyranny, which is indeed a major aspect, but we found that this character has other facets. For instance, he was educated in the West, which would leave a mark on his demeanor. Therefore, this time, we designed the Zhou family's living room to be more Western. We also emphasized his strict sense of time in preparing to receive guests; when he sits alone in the living room at night, he also shows the warmth a person needs towards the photograph of Siping and his son Zhou Chong. Additionally, we noticed that the Germany where he studied is different from England and France. The development of German capitalism and Bismarck's rule are inseparable. This is also meaningful for understanding Zhou Puyao's character. Furthermore, we believe that there is still a lingering affection between Zhou Puyao and Lu Siping, which can be seen in many details of the plot. Mr. Cao Yu once said that a person's first love is the most unforgettable in their life. In other roles and details, we also have some new interpretations, discoveries, and developments.

Reporter: It seems that the interpretation of classic plays should have some flexibility. According to certain theories, the original work as a text can be deconstructed and read in various ways, with differences due to the times and social trends, and also varying from person to person. It cannot form a permanent model. A simple example is that a few years ago, China held its first Shakespearean drama festival, and the performances of Shakespeare's plays were more joyful and bright compared to modern Western Shakespearean performances. Some Westerners who watched the performances also found them heartwarming and convincing, despite the fact that today's Shakespearean performances in their own countries are mostly dark and cold. Some Westerners who watched the performances also found them heartwarming and convincing, despite the fact that today's Shakespearean performances in their own countries are mostly dark and cold.

Xia: Nowadays, Westerners interpret classic plays more freely than we do. Sometimes they let Hamlet wear modern clothing on stage, and the soldiers on stage are fully equipped with modern weapons. Of course, this is also a method. Personally, I advocate sticking as closely as possible to the original work. The interpretation of excellent classic plays should be radiant: different times and different people can observe from various sides and angles, each having their own enlightenment. Some can change the form to adapt to today, while others can pursue the original beauty and completeness... As for those who change the original work beyond recognition but still want to use the original title, I think this goes beyond our discussion of "classic plays." Now, the mid-aged director Lin Zhao Hua, for the Central Academy of Drama, staged "Beijing People" focusing on expressing a kind of human consciousness, and the stage design and performance are also very different from the past. This is also a kind of treatment, and it is allowed.

Reporter: In the next century, the "Thunderstorm" and "Beijing People" on the stage will probably be different from today's, just as we imagine Shakespeare seeing today's stage.

Xia: Historically, this is the case. Because the development of history is indeed inevitable, but it is often unexpected. Otherwise, there would be no drama.

Reporter: Thank you. (Attached photo)

    经典剧目的保留与创新
    ——与夏淳就重排《雷雨》问答
    张大农
    夏淳是焦菊隐先生的同事和弟子，曾合作执导《茶馆》等剧，而今已是北京人艺的元老。当年人艺《雷雨》剧组的演员，如今最年轻的也已年过半百。而《雷雨》——这部中国话剧的经典之作，这棵在舞台上的艺术生命之树该如何使之常葆青春呢？
    记者：夏老，现在人艺重排《雷雨》，是不是因为眼下没什么戏好演才去翻箱底？
    夏淳：不是。人艺这次排演《雷雨》主要是出自以下考虑。首先，人艺作为我们国家的一流剧院，应该有尽可能丰富的保留剧目供人们观赏。这几年，我们排演了《洋麻将》、《哗变》等一批外国优秀剧目以及《狗儿爷涅槃》、《天下第一楼》等新剧目，相对而言，像《雷雨》这样的经典剧目反而演得比较少。在国外，莎士比亚、契诃夫、席勒、奥尼尔的剧作在他们本国都是剧院里久演不衰的保留剧目。实际上，不断地发掘本民族经典著作的宝藏，更深、更新地解释她们的内涵，这也是延续民族文化的重要手段。因此我们设想，今后在排演新戏和外国戏的同时，每年拿出一两台保留剧目。《雷雨》就是我们实现这个设想的第一步。
    其次，现代戏与演员的生活比较贴近，角色的感情相对来说容易体验，演员在舞台上有时连生活步态都无须改变。而优秀的经典剧目则可以从各个方面锻炼我们的青年演员。这次排演《雷雨》，剧组里大部分演员都是年轻人。
    记者：许多观众可能已经看过不止一次《雷雨》了，对剧本很多人是非常熟悉的。如何使这样的保留剧目翻出新意依然吸引人呢？
    夏：这就取决于导演与演员再创造中舞台处理上的创新了。一部优秀的剧作，给导演和演员留有广阔的艺术处理空间。同一角色甚至同一动作，在一些优秀的演员那里可以演出迥然不同的光采。对导演来说也是如此。会看戏的人都懂得，一出戏的魅力主要是在舞台上，好戏可以千变万化。当然读剧本也是另一种享受，但与在剧场看戏还是不一样的。
    记者：这次重排的《雷雨》，与已往的有什么不同？
    夏：过去演《雷雨》，在导演思想上由于受以阶级斗争为纲的影响，容易从意念出发，有些人物关系处理得比较直露和简单。这次我要求把剧中每个角色都当做具体的“人”来研究和看待，深入挖掘每个人物的身世和经历，进而完整准确地把握人物性格。例如繁漪，我们设想她出身于苏州一个旧式的诗书之家，家道已经中落。父亲溺爱她，希望她嫁个有身份、有地位的人，教她琴、棋、书、画，她也有些文化和艺术天份。在嫁给周朴园之前，已经是个老姑娘，有点高不攀、低不就。周朴园有地位、有阅历，就合了她的意，但婚后发现所遇非人。在她的生活中，很少接触男性，这使得她危险地选择了周萍，并在周萍那里第一次真正得到爱情的满足。关于周朴园，过去只是用半封建、半殖民地的社会模式规定他，只表现他的残忍和专横，这当然是个主要方面，但我们发现这个人物还有其他一些侧面。譬如，他毕竟是受过西洋教育的，这会给他的举止风度留下印痕。因此，这次我们把周家的客厅设计得比较洋一些，我们还在他准备会客的细节上强调他有严格的时间观念；当他在深夜独自一人静坐客厅时，也会对侍萍的照片和儿子周冲流露出一个人需要有的温情。同时，我们还注意到，他所留学的德国与英、法等国不同，德国资本主义的发展与俾斯麦的统治是分不开的。这一点对把握周朴园的性格也是意味深长的。此外，我们认为，在周朴园和鲁侍萍之间，依然有一缕旧情，这可以从剧情中很多细节得到表现。曹禺先生也曾说，人的初恋是一生中最难忘的。在其他角色和细节上，我们也有一些新的解释、发现和发挥。
    记者：看来，对经典剧目的解释应该有一个自由度。按照某种理论，原著作为一个文本，可以作出各种各样的拆解和阅读，这里有时代和社会风尚的不同，也因人而异。绝不能形成永久性模式。一个浅近的例子是，前些年中国举办首届莎士比亚戏剧节，演出的莎剧较之现代西方的莎剧，更显欢快和明朗。一些西方人士看了演出也同样认为赏心悦目，令人信服，尽管今天他们自己的莎剧演出大多是色调灰暗、冷隽的。
    夏：现在西方人对经典剧目的解释比我们要自由，他们有时让哈姆莱特穿着现代服装上台，台上的士兵也全副现代武装。当然这也是一种方法。我个人主张还是要尽量忠实原著。对优秀的经典剧作的阐释应该是呈放射状的：不同的时代，不同的人可以从各个侧面和角度去观察，各自有所感悟。有人可以从形式上变化，以适应今天，也有人可以追寻原作最初的精美与完整……至于有人将原著改变得面目全非而仍要挂原著的牌子，我以为这就超出了我们关于“经典剧作”的话题了。现在，我院中年导演林兆华为中央实验话剧院排的《北京人》即着意表现一种人类的意识，在舞台设计和表演上也都与过去有很大不同。这也是一种处理，也是允许的。
    记者：下个世纪舞台上的《雷雨》和《北京人》大概与今天的又会有所不同吧？正如我们设想当年的莎翁看今天的舞台一样。
    夏：历史地看是这样。因为历史的发展固然有其必然，但往往是出人意料的。否则就没有戏剧。
    记者：谢谢。（附图片）
