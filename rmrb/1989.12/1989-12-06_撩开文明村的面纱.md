Lifting the Veil on a Civilized Village

Our county's Shiqiao Township Zhangshi Village was named a Civilized Unit by the county committee and county government in 1987. Last year, the village party branch was awarded the title of Advanced Party Branch by the county committee. However, in this so-called civilized village, there have been disturbing instances of lawlessness and disorder.

Last July, some villagers repeatedly reported the economic issues of certain village and group cadres to the township party committee and county committee. Due to the township party committee's lack of effective investigation, the villagers were dissatisfied. This July, the county committee and county government organized a work team to enter Zhangshi Village, uncovering the economic problems of the cadres.

Extravagant feasting has become a habit. According to incomplete statistics, from January 1987 to April 1989, the village committee and four groups spent 45,000 yuan on entertainment expenses, averaging 51 yuan per day, with each villager bearing a burden of 48 yuan.

Embezzlement and misappropriation are severe. In 1988, out of the 11 village and group cadres in office, 9 misappropriated public funds, with 5,156 yuan embezzled and 3,603 yuan misappropriated.

Arbitrary seizure of collective property. Out of the 8 village cadres, 5 seized over 60 items of collective property, valued at over 4,300 yuan. In early 1982, the village and group levels had fixed assets worth over 130,000 yuan, but now only a few tens of thousands remain.

Creating arbitrary charges to increase levies. The village collected levies from farmers under the guise of agricultural tax collection. From 1986 to 1988, the village's third group collected 2,084.45 yuan in levies under the name of agricultural tax.

Arbitrary collection and misuse of fines and confiscated items. Over the past three years, the entire village has had 77 cases of over-planned births, with fines totaling 25,009 yuan, including 14,465 yuan in cash and 10,544 yuan in kind, none of which were recorded. Much of the cash was used for entertainment expenses or misappropriated by individuals. The management of the kind items was even more chaotic. Whoever confiscated a watch wore it, whoever confiscated a bicycle rode it, and 26,000-plus bricks confiscated as fines also vanished.

The serious problems in this civilized village have raised several questions.

First, the grassroots party organization has not become the leading core. Zhangshi Village has 28 party members, but only two serve as village cadres. At the same time, party building has been neglected.

Second, cadres are arbitrarily replaced without following proper procedures and standards for selecting officials. In recent years, some leaders in grassroots political construction have arbitrarily decided who to remove from office and who to appoint as officials. As a result, people with serious economic problems have become village cadres. If the leaders had genuinely relied on the masses, those with economic problems would not have become officials.

Third, protecting the advanced status without listening to the voices of the masses harms both the advanced status and the masses. The villagers of Zhangshi Village had repeatedly written to the county and township to report the economic problems of the village cadres. However, some leaders in the township believed that the village was a civilized unit, so the relevant issues were left unresolved.

Fourth, rural financial management is chaotic. One important reason why the village and group cadres in Zhangshi Village dared to embezzle collective property and funds is the lack of necessary supervision and strict auditing in rural financial management.

### 撩开文明村的面纱

    撩开文明村的面纱
    我县石桥镇张史村于1987年被县委、县政府命名为文明单位。去年，村党支部又被县委授予先进党支部的称号。然而，就在这个文明村里出现了令人深思的违法乱纪现象。
    去年7月，这个村有的群众先后多次向镇党委、县委反映个别村组干部的经济问题。由于镇党委查处不力，引起群众不满。今年7月，县委、县政府组织工作队进驻张史村，查清了干部的经济问题。
    大吃大喝成癖。据不完全统计，1987年1月到1989年4月，村委会和4个组的招待费达45000元，每天平均51元，全村人均负担48元。
    贪污挪用严重。1988年在职的11名村组干部，有9名挪用公款，其中贪污5156元，挪用3603元。
    任意侵占集体财产。8名村干部有5人侵占集体财产60多件，折款4300多元。1982年初，村组两级拥有固定资产13万多元，而今只剩下几万元。
    巧立名目，增加提留。村里向农民收取提留款时，打着征收农业税的牌子。1986年至1988年，这个村3组以农业税名义向农民征收提留2084.45元。
    乱收滥用罚没款物。近3年来，全村超计划生育77户，罚款25009元，其中现金14465元，实物折款10544元，都未记帐。许多现金被用于招待开支，或被一些个人挪用。实物部分管理更为混乱。手表谁没收谁戴，自行车谁没收谁骑，罚没红砖2.6万多块，也不翼而飞。
    文明村的严重问题，给人留下了一串思考。
    思考之一：基层党组织没有成为领导核心。张史村28名党员，只有两名担任村干部。同时，忽视了党的建设。
    思考之二：随意撤换干部，不按规定程序和用人标准选配干部。近几年来，少数领导同志在基层政权建设中，说撤谁的职，就撤谁的职；说要谁当官，就千方百计让谁当官。结果，有严重经济问题的人当上了村干部。假若真心实意地依靠群众，那些有经济问题的人就当不了官。
    思考之三：为先进护短，不听群众呼声，既害了先进，又失掉了群众。张史村的群众早就向县、镇多次写信反映村干部的经济问题。由于镇里的个别领导人认为这个村是文明单位，便使有关问题不了了之。
    思考之四：农村财务管理混乱，张史村村组干部之所以敢于侵吞集体财产和资金，一个重要原因是农村财务管理缺乏必要的监督和严格的审计。
