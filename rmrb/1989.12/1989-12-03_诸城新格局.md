		Agriculture has been stagnant for five years, but Zoucheng has steadily grown. In 1988, the total agricultural income increased by 95.3% compared to 1984, with an annual growth rate of 18.2%. This year, grain production has set a new record. Why has the urban and rural economy of Zoucheng City been able to develop sustainably, harmoniously, and steadily? Let's take a look—

		The New Pattern of Zoucheng

		Reporter Yao Lifeng

		In recent years, many places have seen agricultural production stagnate, but Zoucheng City in Shandong Province has steadily grown. Compared to 1984, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1988 increased by 103%, with an average annual growth rate of 19.4%; agricultural income increased by 95.3%, with an average annual growth rate of 18.2%. This year, despite a severe drought, grain production has set a new record, increasing by 2.8% compared to last year; from January to October, the total industrial output value and foreign trade export volume increased by 20.8% and 6.6% respectively compared to the same period last year; livestock income reached 250 million yuan, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year.

		Why has Zoucheng been able to maintain such a good momentum of development? Because in recent years, the city has continuously deepened reforms, making the urban and rural economies increasingly integrated, gradually forming a new pattern suitable for a socialist commodity economy: the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture.

		Currently, the city has formed 440 commercial production bases of various sizes, with the agricultural products provided by these bases accounting for more than 70% of the total agricultural product procurement in the city; there are more than 500 large, medium, and small "leading" enterprises, of which the processing of agricultural and sideline products achieved a production value of 7.34 billion yuan in 1988, accounting for 56% of the city's total industrial output value.

		The Deepening of the "Commercial Production Symphony"

		Zoucheng, located in southeastern Shandong, is a county-level city (established in July 1987), with rich agricultural resources. However, before 1979, production was backward, and farmers' annual per capita income was less than 100 yuan. The widespread implementation of the household contract responsibility system with family management as the mainstay and the increasing activity of diversified operations have raised Zoucheng's rural economy to a new level in the early 1980s, basically solving the problem of farmers' subsistence. However, the contradictions between the old economic mechanism's inability to function properly and the further development of commercial production have become prominent:

		First, there is a contradiction between production and sales, and circulation and production are not coordinated. The prices of most agricultural and sideline products have been gradually liberalized, and farmers' attention has begun to shift to the market. However, farmers find it difficult to adapt to the market. They often rush to produce whatever is expensive, leading to overproduction and difficulties in selling. When the market is unstable, farmers see "one year of high prices, one year of low prices, and losses when sales are poor," and they complain. The disconnect between production and sales causes agricultural production to fluctuate, also putting the circulation sector and processing enterprises in a passive position.

		The circulation sector, accustomed to "mandatory procurement and sales, unified procurement and sales," often adopts short-term behaviors such as "pushing when there is a shortage and cutting when there is an excess," artificially increasing market fluctuations and dampening farmers' production enthusiasm.

		Second, the contradictions and frictions between urban and rural areas, between industrial and commercial enterprises and farmers, between domestic and foreign trade, and between departments have become increasingly sharp. Everyone rushes to do profitable things, and no one wants to handle unprofitable things. When a certain agricultural product is in short supply, various departments often compete for the supply, using any means necessary; when there is an excess, everyone withdraws, allowing "low prices to harm agriculture and low livestock prices to harm livestock farming." The result is that producers suffer, operators suffer; everyone competes for profits, but everyone loses.

		The further development of the rural commodity economy calls for a "commercial production symphony."

		The leaders of Zoucheng County Party Committee and County Government seriously studied central documents and, based on the spirit of "overall planning for the commodity economy," drew inspiration from the practice of the county's foreign trade company implementing the integration of commerce and agriculture, comprehensive operation of commerce, agriculture, and industry, actively supporting production, and cultivating supply sources. They provide farmers with a series of services. From 1985 onwards, they promoted this experience, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the supply and marketing, commercial, material, grain, and tobacco economic departments, guiding them to update their concepts, transform their functions, focus on the overall situation of the commodity economy, and work together to provide farmers with matching services. The county gradually formed a "commercial production symphony" with the main theme of "strengthening one foundation (agriculture) and doing well in three areas (livestock, processing, and foreign exchange agriculture)" and the soul of "developing with farmers and sharing prosperity and decline with farmers."

		With the deepening of the "commercial production symphony," they continued to explore the path of transforming urban-rural separation into urban-rural integration and promoting the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture:

		—Focus on the construction of leading enterprises.

		From the practice of commercial production, it can be seen that processing enterprises are the leading enterprises of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture. Zoucheng, based on its local resource advantages, concentrated funds, energy, and technical strength to build leading enterprises directly under the city, while encouraging the construction of leading enterprises in towns and villages, increasing processing, storage, transportation, and market expansion capabilities. Enterprises and farmers form equal and mutually beneficial economic relationships, implementing a one-stop production and operation mode. Leading enterprises take the deep processing of agricultural and sideline products as the main direction, implementing comprehensive utilization from coarse to fine, from main products to by-products and waste materials. Currently, the city has gradually formed processing series for grains and oils, cotton and hemp, poultry and livestock, feed, fruits, and vegetables. The annual processing capacity is 220,000 tons for grains and oils, 50,000 tons for meat, 150,000 tons for feed, 10,000 tons for tobacco re-drying, and 115,000 tons for various canned products.

		—In conjunction with agricultural zoning and industrial structure adjustment, develop leading products systematically and appropriately, and strengthen the foundation of integrated operations.

		The leading enterprises of various departments and industries respectively extend their reach into rural areas, focusing on one or several agricultural and livestock products, and through targeted investment and procurement methods, develop resources and increase output. Starting from providing matching services, support farmers' production, cultivate domestic and foreign trade supply sources, and gradually establish a number of agricultural product production bases with their own characteristics.

		—Implement the combination of leading enterprises and town (township) village services.

		A preliminary system of upper and lower coordination and left and right cooperation has been formed in the city, including seven major service systems: technology promotion, agricultural economy management, supply of production materials, processing and sales, cold storage and transportation. Based on the operational characteristics of various departments and enterprises, reasonable division of labor is implemented, and the service content for farmers is emphasized in different ways, with different support projects. For products that one or two departments cannot fully undertake, the municipal government coordinates them to achieve a "grand symphony," integrating multi-level and multi-form services with the services of leading enterprises, and implementing the services of production, supply, and sales to leading enterprises and relevant departments.

		Several Insights

		First, the development of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture provides an important path for deepening rural reforms.

		In response to the further development of the commodity economy, the gradual integration of production, processing, and circulation helps to promote the coordinated progress of urban and rural reforms, in order to gradually establish a social service, economic operation, accumulation and investment, and interest distribution mechanism that meets the needs of a planned commodity economy and further develops the market.

		Practice has proven that relying solely on market regulation or planned regulation can both lead to production and sales disconnection, increasing market fluctuations. Insisting on and developing the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture can help the government, through leading enterprises, correctly transmit market signals to farmers, guide farmers to produce in a targeted manner, reduce the blindness of production; it can also, through the reasonable division of labor and contractual management of the operating scope of various departments and enterprises in commerce, industry, and agriculture, guide the production and operation activities of enterprises and farmers, as well as the operation of the circulation sector, into the track of a planned commodity economy. At the same time, it helps to gradually form the government's macro-control mechanism.

		Second, the development of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture is conducive to the optimal allocation of production factors, realizing the complementarity of advantages and interests between urban and rural areas, and between agriculture, industry, commerce, and trade.

		The integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture breaks the pattern of urban-rural separation, industrial-agricultural separation, and production-circulation separation, and through the self-regulation within the system, promotes urban-rural exchanges, making the funds, technology, information, and talents of enterprises flow to rural areas, and reasonably combining them with the resources and labor of rural areas. Both sides complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and achieve mutual benefits. Farmers have a strong backing, and enterprises have a stable and reliable supply source, enhancing their competitiveness and forming a group advantage. It is also possible to return a portion of the profits from deep processing to farmers, and within the city, achieve the complementarity of agriculture with industry and commerce, adjust and balance the interests of various links in commerce, industry, and agriculture, relatively improve the comparative benefits of agriculture, create a favorable "microclimate" for agricultural development, and implement the "five unifications" of unified cultivation, irrigation, seed adjustment, supply of production materials, and major technical measures for the content of household contract operations in the entire rural area. Labor productivity has been significantly improved. Last year, each labor force produced an average of 4,272 kilograms of grain, an increase of 31.2% compared to 1984.

		Third, the development of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture is conducive to the large-scale promotion of science and technology, relatively quickly improving the quality of labor, and promoting the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture.

		For example, this city has achieved the standardization of 80% of livestock and poultry and 95% of crops within two to three years through the integration. More than 100,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco, from the selection of varieties to seedling raising, ridge building, scientific fertilization, cultivation management, harvesting, and drying, can all be carried out in accordance with the standards and requirements of high-quality tobacco, basically realizing standardized production, significantly improving the quality and quantity of tobacco leaves, and filling the gap in the export of main raw material tobacco in China.

		Fourth, the development of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture is conducive to the development of agricultural enterprise operations and appropriate scale operations.

		Leading enterprises organize production according to the needs of the international and domestic markets and provide effective services to the family management or specialized contract bodies of thousands of households, thereby promoting the development of agricultural enterprise operations and appropriate scale operations, and accelerating the pace of agricultural commercialization and specialization, significantly improving the level of productivity. The commercialization rate of livestock has reached 89.1%, and all or part of the scale breeding of more than 10 kinds of livestock and poultry has reached more than 50% of the total product quantity. The labor productivity of livestock has been significantly improved. Taking pigs as an example, a labor force in a specialized breeding farm can raise 100 to 150 pigs on average, with labor productivity increased by 5 times compared to traditional breeding, and the fattening period reduced from 170 days to 140 days, with feed consumption also reduced by 10%. Last year, each pig in a specialized breeding farm made a profit of more than 40 yuan. At the same time, under the guidance of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture, a number of new economic organizations such as joint ventures, joint-stock operations, and specialized contract bodies have emerged, improving the organization of farmers.

		Fifth, the development of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture is conducive to the transformation of government functions and the improvement of party-group and cadre-group relationships.

		The implementation of the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture brings together various parties with common interests, and forms equal and mutually beneficial economic relationships between economic departments, enterprises, and farmers, with mutual dependence. Under the drive of common interests, enterprises actively provide services to farmers, and farmers actively develop production, mutually encouraging each other to move forward together. This helps the government to overcome the drawbacks of excessive intervention in specific production and operation activities, and more resolutely move towards the track of macro-control with economic and legal means as the mainstay. It greatly helps to further improve the party-group and cadre-group relationships and further mobilize the enthusiasm of urban and rural cadres and masses.

    农业，徘徊5年，而诸城却稳步增长，1988年农业总收入比1984年增长95.3％，年递增18.2％，今年粮食生产再创新纪录。诸城市城乡经济为什么能持续、协调、稳步发展？请看——
    诸城新格局
    本报记者　姚力文
    近几年，许多地方农业生产陷入徘徊，山东省诸城市却稳步增长。同1984年比，1988年工农业总产值增长103％，年均递增19.4％；农业总收入增长95.3％，年均递增18.2％。今年大旱之年，粮食生产再创新纪录，比去年增2.8％；1—10月份，工业总产值和外贸出口额分别比去年同期增长20.8％和6.6％；畜牧业收入达2.5亿元，比去年同期增11％。
    为什么诸城会保持这样的良好发展势头？因为近几年，这里不断深化改革，使城乡经济日趋融合，逐步形成适应社会主义商品经济的新格局：贸工农一体化。
    目前，全市已形成各种规模的商品生产基地440处，基地提供的农产品占全市农产品收购总额的70％多；大中小“龙头”企业500多家，其中加工农副产品实现的产值（1988年达7.34亿元）占全市工业总产值的56％。
    商品生产“大合唱”的深化
    诸城，地处鲁东南的一个县级市（1987年7月建市），农业资源丰富，但1979年以前，生产落后，农民年人均收入不足百元。以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制的普遍实行，多种经营的日趋活跃，使诸城农村经济在80年代初上了一个台阶，农民温饱问题基本解决。但随之，旧经济机制运转不灵与进一步发展商品生产的矛盾突出出来：
    一是产销矛盾，流通与生产不相适应。大多数农副产品价格的陆续放开，农民的目光开始被引向市场。可是，农民一时难于适应。他们往往是看到哪种东西贵了，就争着去干，生产的东西多了，卖不出，又一哄而下。刚刚把目光移向市场的农民，看到“贵一年，贱一年，销路不好就赔钱”，连连叫苦。产销脱节造成农业生产的忽上忽下，也使流通部门和加工企业陷入被动。
    搞惯了“包购包销、统购统销”的流通部门，往往采取“少了赶，多了砍”的短期行为，人为地增大了市场波动的波幅，挫伤了农民的生产积极性。
    二是城市与乡村、工商贸企业与农民之间、内贸与外贸、部门与部门之间的利益矛盾和摩擦日趋尖锐。有利的事大家抢着干，不利的事又都不愿插手，某项农产品少了，各部门常常为争夺货源而各显神通，以邻为壑；东西多了，大家又纷纷撒手不管，听任“谷贱伤农，畜贱伤牧”。其后果是：生产者受害，经营者受害；都争利，又都失利。
    农村商品经济的进一步发展，呼唤着“商品生产大合唱”。
    诸城县委、县府负责人认真学习中央文件和本着“总揽商品经济全局”的精神，并从县外贸公司实行贸农结合、贸农工综合经营，积极扶植生产，培植货源，向农民提供系列化服务的实践中得到启示。从1985年起，他们推广这一经验，调动供销、商业、物资、粮食、烟草等经济部门的积极性，引导他们更新观念，转变职能，着眼于商品经济的全局，同心协力为全县农民发展商品生产提供配套服务。全县逐步形成以“强化一个基础（农业）、做好三篇文章（畜牧业、加工业、创汇农业）”为主调、以“农民发展我发展，我同农民共兴衰”为灵魂的“商品生产大合唱”。
    随着“商品生产大合唱”的深化，他们继续探索变城乡分割为城乡结合，推进贸工农一体化的路子：
    ——狠抓龙头企业建设。
    从商品生产的实践看，加工企业是贸工农一体化的龙头。诸城从本市资源优势出发，集中资金、能源和技术力量，重点建设市直龙头企业，同时鼓励乡（镇）、村龙头企业，增加加工、储运和对外开拓市场、对内辐射的能力。企业与农民结成平等互利的经济关系，实行产供销一条龙的生产经营方式。龙头企业以发展农副产品深加工为主攻方向，实行由粗到精，从主产品到副产品、下脚料的综合利用。目前，全市已逐步形成粮油、棉麻、禽畜、饲料、果品、蔬菜等十几个加工系列。年加工能力，粮油22万吨，肉类5万吨，饲料15万吨，烟叶复烤1万吨，各类罐头1.15万吨。
    ——结合农业区划和产业结构的调整，因地制宜地搞好主导产品的系统开发，强化一体化经营的基础。
    各部门、各行业的龙头企业，分别把腿伸向农村，围绕一种或几种农畜产品，通过定向投入、定向收购等方式，开发资源，增加产出。从提供配套入手，扶植农民生产，培植内外贸货源，逐步建立起一批各具特色的农产品生产基地。
    ——实行龙头企业与乡（镇）村服务相结合。
    全市范围内初步形成上下配套、左右协作的技术推广、农经管理、生产资料供应、加工销售、冷储运输等七大服务体系。还依据各部门和各企业的经营特点，实行合理分工，对农民的服务内容上各有侧重，项目扶持上各有重点。一个或两个部门难以承担全部服务的产品，由市府统一协调，搞好“大合唱”，把多层次、多形式的服务同龙头企业的服务结合起来，把产、供、销各环节的服务落实到龙头企业，落实到有关部门。
    几点启示
    其一，发展贸工农一体化，为深化农村改革提供了一条重要途径。
    顺应进一步发展商品经济的要求，把生产、加工、流通逐步地融为一体，有助于城乡改革的配套进行，以便逐步建立起适应有计划商品经济需要的社会服务、经济运行、积累投入、利益分配等机制和进一步发育市场。
    实践证明，单靠市场调节或计划调节，都可能造成产销脱节，增大市场震荡。坚持和发展贸工农一体化，便于政府通过龙头企业，把市场信号正确地传递给农民，引导农民定向生产，减少生产的盲目性；还可通过贸、工、农各部门、各企业经营范围的合理分工和契约化管理，把企业、农民的生产、经营活动以及流通部门的经营导入有计划商品经济的轨道。同时有助于政府宏观调控机制的逐步形成。
    其二，发展贸工农一体化，有利于生产要素的优化配置，实现城乡之间、农工商贸之间的优势互补、利益互补。
      贸工农一体化，打破城乡分割、工农分割、生产与流通分割的格局，通过体系内部的自我调节，促进城乡交流，使企业的资金、技术、信息、人才等流向农村，与农村的资源、劳力等生产要素合理组合，双方取长补短，相得益彰。农民有了强有力的依托，企业拥有稳定可靠的货源，增强了竞争能力，形成群体优势。还可把深加工取得的利润，适度返还给农民一部分，在全市范围内，实现以工、以商补农，调节和平衡贸、工、农各环节的利益，相对地提高农业的比较利益，创造有利于农业发展的“小气候”，把“以农业为基础”落到实处，全市农村普遍实行了统一耕种、灌溉、调剂良种、生产资料供应、重大技术措施为内容的“五统一”下的分户承包经营，劳动效率显著提高。去年，每个劳力平均生产粮食4272公斤，比1984年提高31.2％。
    其三，发展贸工农一体化，有利于大面积推广科学技术，较快地提高劳动者素质，促进传统农业向现代化农业的转化。
    如这个市仅用二三年时间，一体化内的80％的畜禽和95％的农作物就实现了良种化。10万多亩黄烟，从选用良种到育苗、起垄、科学施肥、栽培管理、采收烘烤，都能按照优质烟标准和要求认真进行，基本实现了规范化生产，大大提高了烟叶的质量和数量，并填补了我国出口主料烟这一空白点。
    其四，发展贸工农一体化，有利于发展农业企业化经营和适度规模经营。
    龙头企业按照国际、国内市场需求组织生产，并向千家万户的家庭经营或专业承包体提供有效服务，因而带动了农业企业化经营和适度规模经营的发展，并加快了农业商品化、专业化的步伐，较大地提高了生产力水平。畜牧业商品率已达89.1％，全部或部分实行规模饲养的畜禽已达到10余种，其产品占产品总量的50％以上。畜牧业的劳动生产率显著提高。以生猪为例，专业饲养场的一个劳力平均饲养100到150头，劳动生产率比传统饲养提高5倍，育肥期也由170天缩为140天，饲料用量也下降了10％。去年，专业饲养场每头猪盈利40多元。同时，在贸工农一体化引导下，还涌现出联合体、合股经营、专业承包体等一批新的经济组织，提高了农民的组织程度。
    其五，发展贸工农一体化，有利于政府转变职能，密切党群、干群关系。
    实行贸工农一体化，由共同利益把各方联在一起，经济部门、企业与农民之间结成平等互利的经济关系，彼此相互依存。在共同利益的驱动下企业主动为农民提供服务，农民积极发展生产，相互激励，携手前进。这样，便于政府克服过多地干预具体生产经营活动的弊端，更坚决地转向以经济手段、法律手段为主，搞好宏观调控的轨道上来。大有助于进一步改善党群、干群关系，进一步调动城乡群众和干部的积极性。
