A squad of Israeli aircraft invaded the airspace over Beirut on the morning of the 2nd. According to local radio reports, the Lebanese ground forces in the western part of Beirut opened fire on the invading aircraft. At the same time, in the southern Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh, two people were killed in an Israeli air raid.

Regarding the deteriorating situation in Lebanon, Israeli Defense Minister Rabin had previously stated that Israel had no intention of getting involved in Lebanese affairs to avoid getting stuck in a quagmire. However, in a statement issued on November 29, he said, "Israel is closely monitoring the developments in Lebanon," and "if Israel's main interests are threatened, it reserves the right to take free action and resist."

    以色列飞机入侵黎巴嫩领空
    据当地电台报道，一队以色列飞机二日上午入侵了贝鲁特的领空。
    贝鲁特西区的黎巴嫩地面部队向入侵飞机开了火。与此同时，在黎巴嫩南部的奈拜提耶，有两人在以色列飞机的空袭中死亡。
    面对黎巴嫩不断恶化的局势，以国防部长拉宾曾表示，以色列无意卷入黎巴嫩事务，以防陷入困境。但他在十一月二十九日发表的一份声明中则说：“以色列正密切注视着黎巴嫩局势的发展，”“假如以色列的主要利益受到威胁，它将保留自由行动和抵抗的权力。”
