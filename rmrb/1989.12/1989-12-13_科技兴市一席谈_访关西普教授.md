Professor Guan Xipu of Tianjin University, who has made significant achievements in the study of the coordinated development of science, technology, economy, and society, has recently focused on the research of the strategy of revitalizing cities through science and technology. At the "National Symposium on the Strategy of Revitalizing Medium and Small Cities Through Science and Technology," he was a highly sought-after expert. The reporter had a discussion with him on related issues regarding the revitalization of cities through science and technology.

The Significance of Revitalizing Cities Through Science and Technology

Professor Guan said, "Compared to last December's symposium on revitalizing cities through science and technology held in Liuzhou, Guangxi, the number of representatives attending this meeting has increased by two to three times, which shows that the revitalization of cities through science and technology is attracting more and more attention. He said that a direct reason why many city leaders have recently paid attention to the revitalization of cities through science and technology is that they consider finding a way out through science and technology when facing economic difficulties. This idea is correct but not profound enough.

He said that the experience of developed countries tells us: science and technology are the inevitable path to national revitalization. In modern developed countries, the proportion of scientific and technological contributions to economic growth rates is generally between 60% and 70%; while in China, the proportion of scientific and technological contributions to economic growth is generally only between 15% and 30%. It is clear that the potential of scientific and technological power in economic development is enormous. If we want to quickly narrow the gap with developed countries, we cannot do without science and technology. Placing the issue of revitalizing cities through science and technology in such a context makes it seem more profound and important.

The Meaning of "Revitalizing Cities Through Science and Technology"

"What does 'revitalizing' mean? Many people think it means revitalizing the city's economy, mainly referring to industry, and quickly increasing production value. Professor Guan believes that this understanding is not comprehensive enough. Although industry plays a very important role in many cities, if it fights alone, the city's economy will not prosper, and it will also cause serious consequences. He said that a city is a complex large system, and revitalizing a city should be the coordinated development of several major fields. These fields include the economy, science and technology, education, culture, politics, ecology, and population. Whether a country or a city has truly developed depends on whether these aspects are coordinated in their development. Of course, there are priorities, main and secondary, and urgent and non-urgent aspects among these major fields. Generally speaking, in the strategy of revitalizing cities through science and technology, the economy is the center, science and technology is the key, and education is the foundation.

Professor Guan said: People also have different understandings of "science and technology." A narrow understanding mainly refers to solving practical problems in the production process, generally known as hard technology. While a broad understanding of "science and technology" also includes soft science and soft technology. The revitalization of a city not only needs hard science and hard technology but also needs soft science and soft technology. Many of our mistakes are often because we have not solved the problems of soft science and soft technology. Therefore, it is even more necessary to fully attach importance to the research of soft science and soft technology and to raise the development of soft technology to a certain height.

He said that the broad sense of "science and technology" should include five aspects: scientific attitude, scientific spirit, scientific methods, scientific and technological knowledge, and scientific and technological capabilities. In the past, when discussing science and technology, scientific attitude and scientific spirit were not included. Now people are beginning to realize the great role of scientific attitude, scientific spirit, and scientific methods in utilizing scientific and technological knowledge and playing the role of scientific and technological capabilities.

It can be seen that the meaning of revitalizing cities through science and technology is to use broad science and technology to promote the comprehensive and coordinated development of various fields such as the city's economy, education, culture, and politics, rather than using hard science and technology and production engineering technology to develop industry and production value, and it is not a temporary expedient to solve immediate economic difficulties.

The Approach to Implementing the Strategy of Revitalizing Cities Through Science and Technology

What are the basic steps for implementing the strategy of revitalizing cities through science and technology? What kind of approach should it have? This is a concern for leaders at all levels. Professor Guan believes it should include the following contents:

First, there should be a clear starting point and destination, that is, the revitalization of the city's social whole, rather than just achieving a certain production value and developing certain industries.

There should be a special think tank and advisory team for strategic planning and research to provide decision-making references for the important policies of the municipal party committee and government and the solutions to major problems.

A comprehensive and systematic investigation should be conducted on the basic situation of the whole city, such as natural resources, population status, scientific and technological status, scientific and technological personnel structure, as well as the advantages and disadvantages, needs, and possibilities of the city, to prepare for the full deployment of the work of revitalizing cities through science and technology.

Under the guidance of promoting scientific and technological progress, based on the basic situation of the city, the overall concept should be planned, and the development direction of the city should be determined, that is, what kind of nature, characteristics, and status the city should be built into, what it should face, and what it should rely on. After having an overall concept, the structure of various departments of the city should be adjusted to form a complete structural framework.

The situations of various cities are different, and their starting points are different, so the strategies they should adopt should not be the same. But the principles of the strategies they adopt should be basically the same, such as acting within one's capabilities, not rushing in, concentrating forces to fight a decisive battle, and formulating corresponding supporting policies.

After completing the above work, the next step is to conduct research and decision-making on planning and operating mechanisms. The operating mechanism of revitalizing cities through science and technology refers to what the goal is, what is the locomotive, where are the carriages, wheels, parts, and brakes, and how to make them work in coordination to successfully achieve the predetermined goal.

After making the strategic decision to implement the revitalization of cities through science and technology, a powerful overall command center must be organized to fully mobilize all forces and strengthen close cooperation among various departments. Of course, the plan should be supplemented, modified, and tracked according to the development and changes of the situation during the implementation process.

    科技兴市一席谈
    ——访关西普教授
    本报记者　王友恭
    在研究科技、经济、社会协调发展方面富有成就的天津大学教授关西普，近年来又致力于科技兴市战略的研究。在“全国中小城市科技兴市战略研讨会”上，他是一个很受欢迎的专家。记者就科技兴市的有关问题和他进行了交谈。
  科技兴市的意义
    关教授说：“与去年12月在广西柳州召开的科技兴市研讨会相比，出席这次会议的代表增加了二三倍，足见科技兴市越来越引起人们关注。他说，最近以来科技兴市引起许多城市领导重视的一个直接原因，是考虑经济上发生困难后要从科技上找出路。这个想法是对的，但不够深刻。
    他说，发达国家的经验告诉我们：科技兴国是必由之路。现代发达国家的经济增长率里，科学技术占的比重大都在60％—70％；而我国的经济增长里，科技占的比重一般只有15％—30％。可见科学技术的力量在经济发展中的潜力是极大的。我们要想较快缩小与发达国家的差距，不依靠科技是不行的。把科技兴市问题放在这样的背景下来加以理解，就显得更深刻、更重要了。
  “科技兴市”的含义
      “兴市”兴什么？许多人认为就是兴城市之经济，且主要指工业，很快把产值搞上去。关教授认为这种理解不太全面。因为尽管工业在许多城市中占有很重要的地位，但如果它孤军奋战，城市经济也不可能得到繁荣，而且还会造成严重后果。他说，城市是一个复杂的大系统，振兴城市应该是几个重大领域的协调发展。这几个领域包括经济、科技、教育、文化、政治、生态、人口等。一个国家、一个城市是否真正地发展了，就要看这几个方面是否协调发展了。当然，这几个大领域中有轻重、主次、缓急之分。一般说来，在科技兴市的战略中经济是中心，科技是关键，教育是基础。
    关教授说：对“科技”，人们也有不同的理解。狭义的理解主要指解决实际生产过程中难题的技术，一般称硬技术。而广义的
  “科技”还包括软科学、软技术。城市的振兴不仅需要硬科学、硬技术，也需要软科学、软技术。我们许多失误往往都是因为没有解决好软科学、软技术的问题。这就更需要充分重视软科学、软技术的研究，把软科技的发展提到一定的高度。
    他说，广义的“科技”应包括科学态度、科学精神、科学方法、科学技术知识和科学技术能力五个方面。过去谈科技时，科学态度、科学精神并没有列入。现在人们开始认识到科学态度、科学精神、科学方法在利用科技知识、发挥科技能力方面的巨大作用。
    可见，科技兴市的含义是指用广义的科学技术来促进城市经济、教育、文化、政治等各个领域的综合、协调发展，而不仅是用硬科技、生产工程技术来搞工业、搞产值，更不是解决眼前经济困难的权宜之计。
  实施科技兴市战略的思路
    科技兴市战略的实施应具有哪些基本步骤？它是怎样的一种思路？这是各级领导都很关心的。关教授认为它应该包括以下几项内容：
    首先，要有一个明确的出发点和归宿点，即振兴的是城市的社会整体，而不仅仅是达到多少产值，发展多少产业。
    要有专门进行战略设计、研究的智囊团和顾问团，为市委、市政府重要政策的出台、重大问题的解决提供决策参考。
    对全市的基本情况，诸如自然资源、人口状况、科技现状、科技人员结构以及本市所具有的优势和劣势、需要和可能进行系统的全面调查，为科技兴市工作的全面展开做好准备。
    在促进科技进步的思想指导下，依据本市的基本情况运筹整体构想，确定城市的发展方向，即要将本城市建成一个具有什么性质、什么特色、什么地位的城市，面向什么，依靠什么等。有了整体构想以后，要对城市各部门进行结构调整，从而形成一个完整的结构框架。
    各城市的情况不同、起点不同，各自所应采取的策略不应相同。但它们所采取的策略原则，要量力而行，不要一哄而起，要集中兵力打歼灭战，要制定相应的配套政策等，则应是基本相同的。
    在完成以上工作之后，接下来就是进行规划、运行机制的研究和决策。科技兴市的运行机制是指目标是什么，什么是它的火车头，哪里是它的车厢、轮子、配件、制动闸，如何使它们协调动作，从而成功地达到预定的目标。
    作出实施科技兴市的战略决策之后，必须组织一个强有力的总体指挥部，充分调动各方面的力量，加强各部门的密切合作。当然，规划在实施过程中要随着情况的发展变化不断补充、修改和追踪决策。
