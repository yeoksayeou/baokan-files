By the end of November, over 1,000 graduates from local colleges and universities allocated to the experimental units of the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission had completed all military and political training courses as planned. They gradually adapted to military life and initially transformed from civilians to soldiers in terms of ideology, style, and discipline.

This year, according to the needs of national defense construction, the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission received over 1,000 graduates (including postgraduates) from local colleges and universities and allocated them to experimental bases and research institutes. These graduates experienced the spring and summer turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots during their school years, and some students had vague understandings. Initially, some comrades in the unit were concerned about this, not fully trusting the enlisting students, and worried about managing them. Among the students, there was also a general sense of loss, fearing that the party's policy towards intellectuals might change.

In response to these ideological reflections, Ding Henggao, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission, repeatedly emphasized at several meetings that since the founding of the nation, the reason why national defense science and technology industries have achieved remarkable achievements is that there is a group of outstanding science and technology cadres who love national defense science and technology, dare to strive, and work hard. The older generation of scientific experts have deep feelings for the party, the motherland, socialism, and the people's army; the middle-aged scientific cadres have mostly established a correct outlook on life and are the backbone of the current national defense science and technology team; the vast majority of young scientific cadres are politically reliable and have a strong sense of duty, and are the vibrant and hopeful generation of the science and technology cadre team, the future of national defense science and technology. This year's new blood entering the unit is a need for the development of national defense science and technology. Therefore, we should treat them as our own family members, both loving and trusting them, and strictly demanding, strengthening their ideological education, and caring for their growth and progress.

To this end, the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission made specific arrangements for the graduates from colleges and universities this year, first conducting three months of military and political training for them, and then sending them to the grassroots units for nine months of training.

After the students arrived at the unit, the training brigades of various experimental bases made proper arrangements for their clothing, food, housing, and cultural life.

The logistics department of the nuclear test base in the Lop Nur region of Xinjiang made multiple contacts and finally, on the day before classes started, specially airlifted the students' shoulder insignia from Beijing, allowing all students to wear uniform student uniforms on the first day of school. During the military and political training period, leaders and instructors at all levels led by example, eating, living, working, and entertaining with the students, always appearing among the students with an equal attitude. The harmony in emotions dispelled the concerns and doubts of some students who originally thought the unit would "reject them" and strongly felt the warmth and friendliness of the military camp. For those who had participated in demonstrations or made extreme remarks, leaders at all levels did not discriminate or show coldness but warmly helped them eliminate their ideological burdens, inspiring them to reflect on themselves, distinguish right from wrong, and seriously summarize their lessons. Through education, everyone's understanding of the nature and root causes of this political struggle related to the life and death of the party and the state, the importance of only having the party's leadership and only walking the socialist path as the only choice for China's modernization, and the long-term and arduous nature of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization has been improved. Misunderstandings have been cleared up, and ideological doubts have been resolved, making the mood relatively stable. Many students expressed that in this large school of the military, they must work hard to temper themselves and become qualified successors of the national defense science and technology cause.

The units of the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission are mostly located in deserts, Gobi, and deep mountains, with very harsh working environments and living conditions. The pioneers have gradually formed a glorious tradition with the characteristics of scientific research and experimental units through decades of long-term practice. While conducting education on the "three loves," ideological education, legal knowledge education, and current affairs and policy education, the training brigades of various experimental bases emphasized revolutionary tradition education. Money Shaoqing, who was awarded the title of "Model of National Defense Science and Technology Work" by the Central Military Commission, used his personal experience to vividly illustrate the six spirits of the pioneers who fought on this front: "revolutionary dedication, scientific realism, great cooperation, strict discipline, hard work, and innovation," and the noble qualities of the older generation of pioneers who "dedicated their youth, life, and descendants." The vivid and practical revolutionary tradition education ignited the students' revolutionary enthusiasm to love military life, love the test site, and love the national defense science and technology cause, and the revolutionary spirit of hard work and fearlessness of sacrifice. A student deeply felt: "Although the time spent in the unit is not long, from the generals to the unknown cooks, we have learned good thoughts and good styles that we cannot learn in school. The military camp is a large school for tempering people."

A student wrote in his diary: "Everyone has their own personal value. The practice of the older generation of scientific workers shows that only by realizing personal value in the dedication to collective causes, there is a broad field for development; without the support of the party and the people, relying solely on personal struggle will achieve nothing."

    由老百姓到军人
    国防科工委做好入伍大学毕业生的教育工作
    管永义
    截止11月底，分配到国防科工委试验部队的1000余名地方大中专院校毕业生已按计划完成全部军政训练科目，逐步适应部队生活，在思想、作风、纪律等方面初步完成了由老百姓到军人的转变。
    今年，根据国防建设需要，国防科工委从地方大中专院校接收了1000余名毕业生（含研究生），分配到试验基地和研究所。这届毕业生在校期间经历了春夏之交的学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱，部分学员思想上存在一些模糊认识。开始，部队中有些同志对此顾虑较多，对入伍学员不够放心，担心不好管理。在学员中也普遍有一种失落感，担心党的知识分子政策会改变。
      针对这些思想反映，国防科工委党委书记、主任丁衡高在几次会议上反复强调，建国40年来，国防科技工业之所以能取得举世瞩目的成就，原因之一就是因为有一支热爱国防科技事业、敢于拚搏、艰苦奋斗的优秀科技干部队伍。老一辈科技专家对党、对祖国、对社会主义、对人民军队有着深厚的感情；中年科技干部大都树立了正确的人生观，是当前国防科技队伍的骨干；青年科技干部绝大多数政治可靠，事业心强，是科技干部队伍中富有生气和希望的一代，是国防科技事业的未来。今年这批新鲜血液到部队，是国防科技事业发展的需要。因此，我们要把他们当成自己的亲人，既要爱护、信任他们，又要严格要求，加强对他们的思想教育，关心他们的成长和进步。
    为此，对今年分配来的大中专院校毕业生，国防科工委作出了具体的安排，首先对他们进行3个月的军政训练，尔后再到部队基层锻炼9个月。
    学员到部队后，各试验基地教导大队对学员的衣、食、住和文化生活也都妥善地作了安排。
    地处新疆罗布泊地区的核试验基地军需部门经多方联系，终于在开学前一天，专程从北京空运去了学员肩章，使开学这一天全体学员都穿上了制式学员服装。军政训练期间，各级领导和教官以身作则，与学员们同吃、同住、同劳动、同娱乐，处处以平等相处的身份出现在学员中间。思想感情上的融洽，使部分学员原来认为部队会“嫌弃他们”的担心和疑虑解除了，而强烈地感受到军营的温暖和亲切。对那些参加过游行或说过过激言辞的学员，各级领导不歧视、不冷漠，热情地帮助他们消除思想包袱，启发他们立足于自我解剖，明辨是非，认真地总结教训。通过教育，使大家对这场关系到党和国家生死存亡的政治斗争的性质和根源，对只有共产党的领导、只有走社会主义道路才是中国现代化建设的唯一选择，对于反对资产阶级自由化斗争的长期性、艰巨性等重要问题的认识有了提高，澄清了一些模糊认识，解除了思想疑虑，情绪比较稳定。很多学员表示，在军队这所大学校里，一定要刻苦磨练自己，做国防科技事业合格的接班人。
    国防科工委部队大都地处荒漠、戈壁、深山，工作环境和生活条件十分艰苦。创业者们在几十年的长期实践中，逐步形成了具有科研试验部队特色的光荣传统。各试验基地教导大队在对学员进行“三热爱”教育、理想教育、法律常识教育和时事政策教育的同时，突出进行了革命传统教育。曾被中央军委授予“国防科技工作模范”称号的钱绍钧，用自己的亲身经历现身说法，讲述了战斗在这条战线上的创业者们“革命献身，科学求实，大力协同，严守纪律，艰苦奋斗，开拓创新”的6种精神，及老一辈创业者“献青春、献终身、献子孙”的高贵品质。生动实际的革命传统教育，激发了学员们热爱部队生活、热爱试验场区、热爱国防科技事业的革命热情和艰苦奋斗、不怕牺牲的革命精神。有一位学员深有感触地说：“到部队时间虽然不长，但从将军到默默无闻的炊事员身上，我们学到了在学校里学不到的好思想、好作风。军营是一所锻炼人的大学校。”
    有一位学员在日记中写道：每个人都有自己的个人价值。老一辈科技工作者锻炼成长的实践表明，只有在为集体事业的奉献中实现个人的价值，才有广阔的施展天地；离开了党和人民的支持，单靠个人奋斗将一事无成。
    为了使学员们尽快适应部队生活，各基地教导大队组织学员们学习军队的条令条例和各项规章制度，既狠抓训练场上的严格要求，又注意平时作风纪律的养成和熏陶，从点滴做起。各单位普遍反映，学员们的精神面貌发生了很大的变化。
