Recently, we, from the Jiangxi Provincial Gan Zhou City Pharmaceutical Company, accompanied the city's Health Bureau, Drug Inspection Office, and Pharmaceutical Company joint investigation team, conducted an in-depth investigation into the city's pharmaceutical market and discovered that the order in the pharmaceutical market is chaotic. We hope that relevant departments will pay high attention to this issue.

Firstly, there are increasingly more unlicensed drug-selling shops and stalls, exceeding the scope of business registration. Just along the main road, there are more than 10 unlicensed drug-selling shops and stalls. They do not have a _Drug Business Enterprise License_, and they all exceed the scope of business approved and registered by the industrial and commercial administration departments.

Secondly, licensed drug-selling units and individual businesses violate drug procurement regulations. A small number of units and individual businesses like to purchase drugs from various sources on their own and are keen on buying drugs from "sales representatives," thus leading to the sale of fake drugs in the market, seriously harming the health of the people, and damaging the reputation of the pharmaceutical industry.

Thirdly, drug prices in the market are chaotic.

1. Prices are not clearly marked but are called out randomly; some have marked prices, but the prices vary among different stalls.
2. The price does not match the product. For example, in the Eight Borders Trading Store, the display case shows oral glucose, but the label reads "multivitamin glucose," priced at 4.26 yuan, exceeding the regulated price.
3. The same product has different prices. For example, Beijing-produced royal jelly, priced at 6.89 yuan per box in the food section of the Department Store, is priced at 6.30 yuan per box in the front of the temple; the Gan Nan Joint Venture's Beijing royal jelly is priced at 6.70 yuan per box in the food store of Wan Jia Huan, 6.00 yuan in the food store of Nan Ling, and 6.10 yuan in the children's food store.

We appeal to relevant departments at all levels to pay high attention to this issue, immediately take measures to strengthen the management of the pharmaceutical market, seriously implement the _Drug Administration Law_, strengthen the supervision and management of the pharmaceutical market, and legally investigate and deal with those who manufacture fake and substandard drugs, inflate drug prices, and disrupt the pharmaceutical market.

### 药品经营　严格依法  市场混乱　害了百姓

    药品经营　严格依法
    市场混乱　害了百姓
    江西省赣州市医药公司王锡林、刘烈祯来信：最近，我们随市卫生局、药检所、医药公司联合调查组，深入我市医药市场调查发现：我市医药市场秩序混乱，希望有关部门引起高度重视。
    一、无证经营药品的门点、摊点越来越多，超越工商登记证的经营范围。仅大公路就有10多家无证经营药品的门点和摊点，他们没有取得《药品经营企业许可证》，而且都超越了各自经工商行政部门核准登记的经营范围。
    二、有证经营药品的单位和个体户，违反药品进货有关规定。极少数单位和个体户喜欢自行多方购药，热衷于从“推销员”手中购药，从而造成市场卖假药，严重侵害人民群众身体健康，败坏医药行业声誉。
    三、市场药价混乱。
    （1）不是明码标价，而是随口叫价；有的虽有标价，但摊点之间价格各异。
    （2）价货不符。如八境台商店商品柜里陈列的是口服葡萄糖，但牌卡上写的是多维葡萄糖，价格也是多维葡萄糖的价4.26元，超过规定的价格。
    （3）同一商品几种价格。如北京产的人参蜂王浆，百货大楼副食品柜里的为6.89元一盒，而大庙前的为6.30元一盒；赣南联营的北京人参蜂王浆，万家欢副食品商店的为6.70元一盒，南岭副食品商店的为6.00元，儿童食品商店的为6.10元。
    我们呼吁各级有关部门应给予高度重视，立即采取措施，加强医药市场的管理，认真贯彻《药品管理法》，加强医药市场监督管理，对那些制造假药、劣药，哄抬药价，扰乱医药市场者依法予以查处。
