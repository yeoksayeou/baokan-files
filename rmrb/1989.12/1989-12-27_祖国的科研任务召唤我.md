In 1985, I was awarded a scholarship by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) project under the cultural exchange agreement between China and Canada. I went to Canada to study transportation system analysis and computer simulation.

Those who have worked or studied abroad may share the same feelings. We often compare what we see and hear with our own country, and at such times, we are always anxious about the gaps between our country and developed countries. During my studies, I visited various transportation methods, facilities, and research institutions in Canada. Comparing these with China's current transportation situation, I felt the gap keenly and genuinely felt the responsibility and duty of being a Chinese person.

After completing the original study tasks, I planned to extend my stay abroad for a while. The leaders of the research institute entrusted a colleague attending an academic conference abroad to brief me on the domestic situation, especially the key projects arranged by the state to address the long-standing constraints on national economic development posed by transportation issues. They hoped I could return to participate in these efforts.

The motherland's economic construction and transportation research tasks are calling me. A sense of urgency to quickly contribute to national construction, a sense of pride in being trusted, understood, and able to quickly dedicate myself to the motherland's construction prompted me to abandon the plan to delay my return. I returned to the motherland immediately after the completion of the original study period.

After returning to the country, my seniors, leaders, and colleagues provided me with full trust, support, and assistance in my research work.

Transportation system research is a comprehensive study that involves multiple disciplines. A project often requires the cooperation of multiple departments and units, and the research team members are also numerous. Leaders and colleagues always push me to the forefront. Through training, I have gained rich practical work experience and achieved some results. Over the past two years, I have successively led and participated in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" national key scientific and technological research projects, including the comprehensive development of the Yangtze River waterway, the feasibility study of sea cold chain container transportation to solve the problem of uneven production of vegetables and fruits in the southern and northern regions, the research on the coal transportation system in South China to alleviate the tense energy transportation situation, the research on the construction of the waterway transshipment system to expand the port's capacity, and the computer-aided decision support system for shipping enterprises' production and operation. I feel that in my work, I have the support and help of my seniors, colleagues, and leaders, and in my life, I receive the care of the leaders. I am fortunate.

I admit that our country is still relatively poor, but it is precisely because of this that we, the younger generation, need to strive and work to change her appearance. Looking back on the past few years, I found that what lies before us is a vast field where we can display our talents and achieve great things.

    祖国的科研任务召唤我
    交通部水运科学研究所　丁迅
    我在1985年考取加拿大CIDA项目奖学金，根据中加两国文化交流协定，赴加拿大学习运输系统分析及计算机模拟。
    在国外工作或者学习过的同志可能都有同感，我们总是把所见所闻与自己的祖国相比较，而每当此时，又总是为我们的国家与发达国家间所存在的差距而焦虑。在学习期间，我考察了加拿大各种运输方式、运输设施和运输科研机构，与我国运输现状对照，痛感我们的差距，更由衷地感到作为一个中国人应该承担的责任和义务。
    在原定的学习任务完成后，我曾打算再延长一段在国外的时间。研究所的领导又一次委托到国外参加学术会议的同志向我详细地介绍了国内的形势，特别是国家为解决长期以来制约国民经济发展的交通运输问题而安排的一些重点课题，并希望我能回国参与这些工作。
    祖国的经济建设、交通运输的科研任务在召唤着我，一种渴望尽快投入国家建设的紧迫感，一种被信任、被理解和能够尽快投身于祖国建设中去的自豪感促使我放弃了延期回国的计划，在原定的学习期满后立即返回了祖国。
    回国后，学长、领导和同志们在研究工作中给予了我充分的信任、支持和帮助。
    交通运输系统研究是一个包含多学科在内的综合性研究工作，一个项目往往需要多部门、多单位的协作，课题组人员也比较多，而领导和同志们总是将我推到第一线。通过锻炼，丰富了我实际工作的经验，也取得了一定成绩。两年来，我先后主持、参加了“七五”国家重点科技攻关项目——长江水系航运综合开发，为解决我国南北地区蔬菜水果生产不均衡问题的海上冷藏集装箱运输可行性研究，为缓解能源运输紧张局面的华南煤炭运输系统研究，为扩大港口通过能力的水上过驳系统建设研究，以及面向航运企业生产经营的计算机辅助决策支持系统等科研课题。我感到，工作中有前辈、学长和同志们的支持和帮助，生活上得到领导的关怀，自己是幸运的。
    我承认，我们的国家还是比较贫穷的，但正因为如此，才更需要我们年轻一代为改变她的面貌去奋斗、去工作。回顾几年来的经历，我发现，展现在面前的正是我们这一代人施展才能、大有作为的广阔天地。
