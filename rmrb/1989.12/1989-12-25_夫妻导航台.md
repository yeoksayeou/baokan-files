	Husband and Wife Navigation Station
	Ào Tēng Fēng Bǎo Chéng

	At the southern end of the Inner Mongolian grasslands of Xilingol, 4.9 kilometers from the Sino-Mongolian border, lies the city of Erlianhot, known as the "Northern Gate of the Motherland." Here, there is a civilian aviation navigation station in Inner Mongolia, the Erlian Navigation Station. The station has only two people—station chief, Communist Party member Xu Xinxiong, and his wife, the technical staff member Feng Shumei, known as the "Husband and Wife Navigation Station."

	This "Husband and Wife Navigation Station" is responsible for the navigation tasks of international flights from Beijing to Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin, and Ulaanbaatar. Ten years ago, the 27-year-old Xu Xinxiong, who had been trained in the military, resolutely gave up the favorable working conditions and comfortable living environment in Hohhot and came to the Erlian Navigation Station. The climate here is harsh, with six months of the year requiring winter clothing, and sometimes it even snows in June. Water is transported by train, and vegetables are shipped from outside. Initially, there were three people at the station, but later only Xu Xinxiong remained. Every day, in addition to his regular shifts, he had to buy groceries, cook, and do chores, always busy.

	The harsh natural environment and difficult living conditions were undoubtedly a severe test for Xu Xinxiong. When he was hesitating whether to stay or leave, his newlywed wife Feng Shumei came to his side and became a contract worker. He happily told her, "Now that you're here, we won't leave." From then on, the couple settled down at this small border navigation station.

	Feng Shumei, a high school graduate from central Hebei, came to this harsh place. Under her husband's guidance and example, after a year of hard study, she mastered the navigation business and simple machine maintenance skills, and could work independently on shifts. The Inner Mongolia Civil Aviation Bureau officially hired her as a navigation technical staff member. Later, she obtained a navigation qualification certificate with excellent results.

	Xu Xinxiong was delighted to see his wife's progress in her professional skills. The young couple took the station as their home, sharing both joy and hardship. Over the years, they worked an average of more than 10 hours a day, never taking a day off for holidays, and never going shopping or to the movies together. To ensure the normal operation of the machines, they studied diligently together, mastered the technology to eliminate mechanical faults, and kept the navigation equipment in good condition. There were never any serious errors or accidents, ensuring the smooth operation of the flight routes.

	The "Husband and Wife Navigation Station" has made contributions to the country's aviation industry and has been commended by superiors. Xu Xinxiong has been continuously recognized as an advanced worker and outstanding Communist Party member of the Inner Mongolia Civil Aviation Bureau for many years and has been awarded the "National Outstanding Border Youth Medal."

    夫妻导航台
    傲腾　封宝诚
    在内蒙古锡林郭勒大草原南端，距中蒙边界4.9公里的祖国北大门二连浩特市，有一个民航内蒙古区局二连导航台。台里只有两个人——台长、共产党员续欣龙及其妻子、机务员冯淑梅，人称“夫妻导航台”。
    这个“夫妻导航台”担负着北京飞往莫斯科、华沙、柏林和乌兰巴托国际航线的导航任务。10年前，在部队受过锻炼年仅27岁的续欣龙，毅然放弃了呼和浩特优越的工作条件和舒适的生活环境，来到了二连导航台。这里气候寒冷，一年有6个月要穿棉衣，有时6月份还飘雪花，吃水靠火车拉，吃菜从外地运。开始台里有3个人，后来只剩下续欣龙1人，他每天除了按时上台值班工作外，还要买粮买菜，烧水做饭，整天忙得团团转。
    恶劣的自然环境，艰苦的生活条件，对续欣龙无疑是严峻的考验。正当他犹豫不决是走还是留的时候，新婚不久的妻子冯淑梅来到了他的身边，当了一名合同制工人。他高兴地对小冯说：“这下好了，你来了我们就不走了。”从此，夫妻俩便扎根于这个边陲小小导航台。
    高中毕业的冯淑梅，从冀中平原来到这艰苦的地方，她在丈夫的言传身教下，经过一年的刻苦学习，熟练地掌握了导航业务和简单的机器维修技术，并能单独上台值班，民航内蒙古区局正式录用她为导航机务员。后来，她又以优良的成绩获取导航的合格证书。
    续欣龙看到妻子在业务技术上的长进，打心眼里高兴。这对小夫妻以台为家，同甘共苦。多年来，平均每天工作10个多小时，没有休过节假日，也没有一起逛过商店，进过电影院。为了保证机器的正常运转，他们一起刻苦学习业务，掌握排除机械故障的技术，使导航的机器设备保持良好状态，从没有发生严重差错和责任事故，保证了航线畅通。
    “夫妻导航台”为国家的航空事业做出了贡献，受到上级表彰。续欣龙连续多年被评为民航内蒙古区局先进工作者和优秀共产党员，还荣获“全国边陲优秀儿女奖章”。
