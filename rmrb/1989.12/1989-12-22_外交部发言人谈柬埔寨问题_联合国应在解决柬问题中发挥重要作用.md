	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on the Cambodian Issue:
	The United Nations Should Play a Key Role in Resolving the Cambodian Problem

	People's Daily, Beijing, December 21st — Reporter Gu Yuqing reports: Today, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Jin Guihua, in response to an Australian journalist's question about whether China's stance on the Cambodian issue has changed, pointed out that the Chinese government's position on the Cambodian issue is consistent. That is, Vietnam should withdraw its armed forces from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision. A provisional coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk, with the participation of all four parties, should be established. He went on to emphasize that we still believe this is the best and most fair and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian issue. This will help ensure that Cambodia becomes a truly independent, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned country.

	He said that during the visit of Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Deputy Secretary Michael Costello, the Australian Foreign Minister Evans introduced his new ideas for resolving the Cambodian issue. China appreciates the Australian government's efforts over the years to achieve a political solution to the Cambodian issue. China supports Australia's proposal to strengthen the role of the United Nations in resolving the Cambodian issue. The Chinese government believes that the United Nations and the United Nations Secretary-General should play an important role in the process of politically resolving the Cambodian issue, especially in establishing international supervision mechanisms and international guarantee measures.

    外交部发言人谈柬埔寨问题
    联合国应在解决柬问题中发挥重要作用
    本报北京12月21日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天，外交部发言人金桂华在回答澳大利亚记者有关中国在柬埔寨问题上的立场有无变化提问时指出，中国政府对柬问题的立场是一贯的。这就是，越南应该在严格有效的国际监督下，从柬埔寨真正全部撤出它的武装力量，成立以西哈努克为首的，由四方参加的临时联合政府。他接着强调说，我们仍然认为，这是公正、合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题的最佳方案。这将有利于保证柬埔寨成为一个真正独立的、和平的、中立的和不结盟的国家。
    他说，在澳大利亚外交贸易部副秘书长迈克尔·科斯特洛访华时，介绍了澳外长埃文斯关于解决柬埔寨问题的新设想。中国赞赏澳大利亚政府多年来为政治解决柬问题所作的努力。赞成澳大利亚在解决柬问题中加强联合国作用的主张。中国政府认为，联合国和联合国秘书长应在政治解决柬埔寨问题进程中，特别是在建立国际监督机制、国际保证措施方面发挥重要作用。
