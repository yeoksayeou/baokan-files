Famous agronomist and 71-year-old Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference member, Inner Mongolia Agricultural College Professor Lin Weishen, has made significant contributions to national defense construction. The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and the Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly selected him as a "National Exemplary Soldier Supporter." On the eve of this year's August 1st, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government and the Inner Mongolia Military Region jointly conferred upon him the honorable title of "Exemplary Patriot and Soldier Supporter."

In the summer of 1976, during the 10 years of turmoil, Lin Weishen, who had suffered much, was undergoing "re-education" in the Langshan area of Bayannur, Inner Mongolia. One day, the logistics director of a certain border defense regiment of the Inner Mongolia Military Region drove 300 miles to find Lin Weishen and said, "Our regiment's officers and soldiers have long wanted to grow vegetables, but we have failed many times. We heard you are an expert in vegetable cultivation. Could you come and guide us?"

Lin Weishen immediately requested leave and went to the regiment's base with the director. At this border defense regiment, Lin Weishen learned that officers and soldiers could only eat fresh vegetables six or seven times a year, and for the rest of the year, they had to eat "one earth (potatoes) and two foreigners (cabbage)." Even this meager necessity had to be purchased from hundreds of miles away in the Hetao area or even from inland provinces. The long-distance transportation of vegetables not only increased the burden on the country's railways and roads but also often resulted in spoilage. Sometimes, an entire carload of 50,000 kilograms of cabbage would arrive frozen and rotten, having to be discarded. What pained Professor Lin the most was that due to the lack of green vegetables, border soldiers developed symptoms such as hair loss, brittle nails, night blindness, and skin problems. Therefore, he earnestly told the regiment's leadership, "Although the conditions here are poor, we have ways to grow vegetables!"

Everything is difficult at the beginning. After much consideration, Lin Weishen decided to first help the regiment build a greenhouse to quickly grow a batch of vegetables, boost the morale of the officers and soldiers, and also provide the entire regiment with a vegetable seedling base. Thus, he worked with the logistics director, traveling back and forth in the vast desert for two full days, finally finding a place that met the four conditions of "wind protection, sun exposure, loose soil, and underground water," suitable for building a greenhouse and growing vegetables.

At this time, it was the hot mid-July. During the day, Lin Weishen led the officers and soldiers to intercept underground water and dig large wells under the scorching sun to solve the water source problem for growing vegetables. At night, they worked by lamplight, leveling the ground, burying poles, and building frames. In just over 10 days, the first half-acre greenhouse was built on the desolate desert. Lin Weishen then selected a few diligent and meticulous soldiers, teaching them the knowledge of greenhouse vegetable cultivation, including sowing, watering, fertilizing, ventilation, temperature control, disease prevention, and pest control, and guiding them step-by-step in actual operations. When the winter cold wave came, the outdoor temperature dropped to minus 30 degrees at night. Lin Weishen led the soldiers to burn horse manure in the greenhouse to increase the temperature, ensuring the safe growth of the vegetables. The following New Year's Day and Spring Festival, the regiment's officers and soldiers enjoyed garlic sprouts, green onions, leeks, cilantro, spinach, and celery grown in their own greenhouse.

After one greenhouse was built and harvested, greenhouses in various companies and platoons were established one after another. Under Lin Weishen's meticulous guidance and assistance, the regiment's greenhouses and plastic greenhouses produced cucumbers and tomatoes, among 12 other vegetable varieties, with yields of 6,000 kilograms and 7,500 kilograms per acre, respectively. The regiment achieved a bumper harvest of over 60,000 kilograms of vegetables annually, completely changing the situation of vegetable scarcity. Previously, cucumbers and other summer and autumn vegetables purchased from outside cost 1.2 yuan per kilogram, but now they are produced locally at 0.16 yuan per kilogram. During the peak production season, the regiment could even supply some to nearby herdsmen.

A certain border defense company is stationed on the border of the Greater Khingan Range. There, the frost-free period is only from early June to early September, a total of about 80 days. The company had attempted to grow vegetables many times but failed. Lin Weishen guided and assisted the company in taking a series of measures, finally enabling the border defense troops stationed in the extremely cold region to enjoy self-grown fresh peppers, tomatoes, bamboo shoots, and cauliflower, among more than 10 varieties, and continuously supplying a nearby forestry bureau's workers.

In late June of this year, Lin Weishen visited the vegetable fields of two companies stationed in the northeastern border town of Manzhouli. The soldiers growing vegetables reported: "Here, the bean vines do not grow well, and the beans produced are few and short, and this happens every year." Lin Weishen picked up a hoe and started loosening the soil around the bean roots, telling the officers and soldiers present that the beans did not grow well mainly because the soil was compacted, with poor ventilation and water retention, hindering the growth of the bean roots and causing malnutrition. After adopting Lin Professor's advice, the beans indeed revived, and the yield increased several times compared to the same period last year.

The vast border line of Inner Mongolia stretches across vast grasslands, vast deserts, dense forests, and towering mountains. Most of these places experience sandstorms in spring, scorching heat in summer, continuous rain in autumn, and ice and snow in winter. Traveling to the border from the interior is like a difficult "expedition." Now that Lin Weishen is older, his position is higher, and his reputation is greater, he still enjoys being with the soldiers. Every year, he spends a lot of time visiting border companies and outposts, providing on-site guidance and assistance. Whether it is a large car, a small car, a camel, a horse, or a "11" bicycle, he does not choose the best. When encountering strong winds, snowstorms, and heavy rains that cause the car to get stuck, he helps the driver push the car. Once, the car broke down midway, and he was injured and fainted. When he woke up, he waved his hand at the frightened young driver, "Old bones are used to being thrown around, no problem!" He then climbed back into the repaired car and continued. Whether it is a company, an outpost, a tent, an earthen house, an iron-framed house, a brick house, a tile house, or a building, he has stayed in all of them, always eating the same food and sleeping in the same bed as the soldiers, never asking for special treatment. Because of his age, after a day of traveling and working, he inevitably feels sore and tired. In addition, almost all of northern Inner Mongolia is a high-altitude cold region. Professor Lin often wakes up at night in the military dormitory due to pain and cold, but he does not mind. No matter how he sleeps at night, he works as usual during the day.

Fourteen years of wind and rain, fourteen years of hard work, have made this elderly man appear more aged in the eyes of the border officers and soldiers. Whenever the officers and soldiers see his wrinkled face, white hair, and hurried figure, their hearts are filled with gratitude.

    爱国拥军模范林维申
    涂国之　郝建军　冯朗峰
    我国著名的农学家、今年71岁高龄的内蒙古自治区政协委员、内蒙古农牧学院教授林维申，由于为国防建设做出了重要贡献，解放军总政治部和国务院民政部联合评选他为“全国拥军先进个人”。今年“八一”前夕，内蒙古自治区人民政府和内蒙古军区，又联合授予他“爱国拥军模范”的光荣称号。
    1976年盛夏，在10年内乱中备受折磨的林维申，正在内蒙古巴彦淖尔盟狼山地区接受“再教育”。一天，内蒙古军区边防某团后勤处处长开车从300里外赶来找林维申，对他说：“我们团干部战士早就想种菜，但搞了好多回都失败了。听说您是种菜权威，能否去给我们指导指导？”林维申当即请了假，随来人前往边防某团驻地。
    在这个边防团，林维申了解到，干部战士一年之中只能吃上六七次新鲜蔬菜，常年累月吃的都是“一土（土豆）、二洋（洋白菜）。”就连这微薄至极的生活必需品，还要到数百公里外的河套地区乃至内地省份去采购。蔬菜长途运输，不仅加重了国家铁路、公路的负担，而且往往烂得多、吃得少，有时多达5万公斤的整车皮大白菜，运来时已全部冻烂，只好扔掉。更叫林教授牵肠挂肚的是，由于长年吃不上青菜，边防战士出现掉头发、翘指甲、夜盲症、烂皮肤等疾病。于是，他毅然恳切地对团的领导说：“这儿条件虽然很差，但我们有办法种出菜来！”
    万事开头难。林维申经过反复考虑，决定先帮团部建一个温室，尽快种出一批菜来，激励指战员们增强信心，同时也使全团有一个蔬菜育苗基地。于是，他带着团后勤处处长早出晚归，奔走在茫茫戈壁，整整忙了两天，终于找到了一处具备“背风、向阳、土质疏松、有地下水”这样4个条件、适合建温室种菜的地方。
    此时，正值天气炎热的7月中旬。白天，林维申带着干部战士，顶着烈日截潜流、挖大口井，解决种菜的水源问题。晚上，他们挑灯夜战，削坡造地，埋柱搭架。只用了10多天时间，荒僻的戈壁滩上就盖起了第一座半亩大的温室。林维申又让团里选来几个办事精明、仔细的战士，给他们讲授温室种蔬菜的下种、浇水、施肥、通风、升温、降温、防病、除虫等知识，并实地指导他们逐项操作。冬季寒流来了，夜间室外气温降至零下30多度，林维申就领着战士们在温室内用马粪生火增温，正生长着的蔬菜安然无事。第二年元旦和春节，这个团的官兵吃上了本团温室里产的蒜黄、青蒜、韭菜、香菜、菠菜、芹菜等蔬菜。
    一个温室建成、丰收后，各营连的温室相继建立起来了。在林维申的精心帮助、指导下，这个团的温室和塑料大棚种的黄瓜、西红柿等12种蔬菜，分别获得亩产6000公斤和7500公斤的好收成。全团一举获得了年产蔬菜6万余公斤的大丰收，彻底改变了吃菜难的状况。过去到外地拉来合1.2元钱1公斤的黄瓜等夏秋菜，现在自产1角6分钱1公斤。产菜旺季，团里还能送一部分给附近的牧民群众。
    某边防营驻守在大兴安岭一带的国境上。那儿每年无霜期只有6月上旬至9月初这80多天。营里曾经作过多次种蔬菜试验都失败了。林维申指导、帮助营里采取了一系列措施，终于使驻守在奇寒地带的边防部队，吃上了自产的辣椒、西红柿、窝笋、菜花等10多个品种的鲜菜，还源源不断地供应当地一个林业局的职工。
    今年6月下旬，林维申来到驻守东北边陲满洲里两个连队的菜地，种菜的战士反映：这儿的豆角藤长不长，结下的豆角又少又短，而且年年如此。林维申操起锄头就给豆角根部周围松土，并告诉在场的官兵，豆角长不好，主要是因为土地板结，透气和保水肥性能差，妨碍豆藤根子生长，造成营养不良。连里采纳林教授的意见后，豆角果然起死回生，产量比往年同期增长几倍。
    内蒙古漫长的边防线上有茫茫草原、浩瀚戈壁、莽莽林海、重重山岭。这里的大多数地方，春天黄沙蔽日，夏天暑气炙人，秋天阴雨连绵，冬天冰封雪盖，从内地下一次边防，简直是一次艰难的“远征”。现在林维申年岁大了，职务高了，名声响了，他仍乐与士兵为伍，每年抽出许多时间到边防连队、哨所，现场帮教、指导。大车、小车、驼马、“11”号自行车，他从不择优嫌劣。遇到大风雪和暴雨陷住车，他就和司机一起垫轱辘，帮着推车。一次，汽车开到中途，发生了事故，他摔伤晕厥，醒过来便冲着吓坏了的小司机摆摆手：“老骨头经摔，没事儿！”爬上修好的车子继续走。到边防连队、哨所、帐篷、土房、地窝棚、铁架屋、砖瓦房、楼房，他都住过，始终和战士们同吃一样的饭，同睡一样的床，从不要特殊照顾。因为上年纪了，奔波劳作一天下来，难免腰酸腿疼，加上北疆几乎全是高寒区，林教授住在部队宿舍，夜间常常被疼醒、冻醒，可他全不在乎，不管晚上睡得怎样，白天照样干。
    14年的风风雨雨，14年的劳筋累骨，使出现在边防干部战士面前的这位长者已日显苍老。每当指战员们看到他满脸皱纹、满头白发、来去匆匆的身影时，内心都充满感激之情。
