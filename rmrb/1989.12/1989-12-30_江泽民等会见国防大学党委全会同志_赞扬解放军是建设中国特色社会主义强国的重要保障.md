Jiang Zemin and Others Meet with the Full Body of the National Defense University Party Committee

Praise the PLA as an Important Guarantee for Building a Socialist Power with Chinese Characteristics

BEIJING, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing, and Secretary of the Central Military Commission Yang Baibing, met with all the attendees of the National Defense University Party Committee plenary session this morning. Also present at the meeting were members of the Central Military Commission Hong Xuezhi, Qin Jiwei, Chi Haotian, and Zhao Nanqi.

At around 8 a.m., Jiang Zemin and other leaders, accompanied by Zhang Zhen, President of the National Defense University, and Li Degeng, Political Commissar, met with the attendees of the National Defense University Party Committee plenary session and extended New Year greetings to them.

Jiang Zemin made an impromptu speech, saying that the National Defense University is the highest institution of learning in our army. High-ranking military cadres working on the front lines, through studying and improving here, elevate their practical experience to a theoretical level, becoming senior military builders. With such a cadre, and with continuous improvement in scientific and cultural levels and organizational command capabilities, our army will definitely become a politically qualified and modernized army.

Jiang Zemin said, we are proud that the People's Liberation Army of China, since its founding, has been armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Under the absolute leadership of the Party, after more than half a century of long-term revolutionary wars and the tests of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it has become a great army loyal to the Party and the people. This army is an important guarantee for us to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, carry out reform and opening up, and build a socialist power with Chinese characteristics.

    江泽民在即席讲话中说，国防大学是我军的最高学府，在第一线工作的军队高级干部，通过到这里学习深造，把实践经验上升到理论的高度，成为高级建军骨干。有了这样一批骨干，再加上不断提高科学文化水平和组织指挥能力，我们这支军队就一定能成为政治上永远合格的现代化军队。
