Canada's federal government Finance Minister Wilson finally, under immense pressure from various quarters, changed his decision to impose a 9% Goods and Services Tax (GST) nationwide starting January 1, 1991, and reduced the tax rate to 7%. This action temporarily eased tensions, but the difficulties faced by the Canadian government in implementing fiscal austerity measures have not significantly diminished.

In August of this year, the Canadian federal government introduced a new Goods and Services Tax to replace the outdated Manufacturers' Sales Tax. The primary goal of this tax reform, which had been in the works for three and a half years, was to increase tax revenues to reduce the federal government's annual budget deficits and the ever-growing national debt. Official statistics show that Canada's national debt reached 321.1 billion Canadian dollars by the 1988-1989 fiscal year, with the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching 51.8% in the 1987-1988 fiscal year. The annual deficits and the massive national debt have become a heavy burden on the Canadian economy. The new Goods and Services Tax is one of the government's strategies to address this "number one economic problem." According to Finance Minister Wilson's initial plan, a 9% tax rate would have increased government revenues by 24 billion Canadian dollars annually. However, such a high tax rate could lead to inflation and was met with widespread opposition. Therefore, the government was forced to compromise and reduce the tax rate to 7%. This reduction will decrease revenues by 5.9 billion Canadian dollars, but the government cannot abandon its plan to reduce the deficit. In this situation, there are only two options: either shift part of the tax burden to another group or reduce government spending.

According to the recently announced tax reforms, the tax rate for large enterprises with assets exceeding 100 million Canadian dollars will increase from 0.175% to 0.2%, and the additional federal tax for high-income households will increase from 3% to 5%. The annual 600 million Canadian dollars in management subsidies for small businesses will be canceled. Some who still disagree with the revised tax system criticize the government's actions as taking money from one hand and putting it back into another.

At the same time, the federal government has also implemented measures to reduce administrative spending by 1.4 billion Canadian dollars, including selling some of the federal government's aircraft, closing a self-service cafeteria in the Parliament building, discontinuing the use of several office buildings, and reducing official travel by federal government officials. These measures will naturally face opposition, but the government appears determined to implement this plan.

Among Western countries, Canada's economic growth is relatively fast, but several noteworthy trends have emerged in the economy this year. First, the rate of economic growth has slowed, from 4.5% in 1988 to 3% this year. Second, the Bank of Canada's interest rates have remained at around 12.5% since March this year. Third, the Canadian dollar's exchange rate against the US dollar has been rising throughout the year, reaching a high of 86 US cents per Canadian dollar by early December, the highest since September 1980. Fourth, Canada's foreign trade deficit in October this year was the first in 13 years. Lastly, due to reduced demand, major Canadian automobile manufacturers have seen industrial cutbacks, shutdowns, and layoffs, showing signs of potential economic recession. While there is debate over whether Canada's economy will enter a recession in the new year, the consensus is that the rate of economic growth will slow down.

Although many Canadian economists believe that high interest rates are the main obstacle to economic development, the government is more concerned about inflation. Canada's inflation rate reached 11.4% in 1980, but it dropped below 5% in 1987, 1988, and 1989. The Canadian economy has maintained a growth trend for nearly seven years since 1983, and the inflation rate has been kept at its current low level thanks to the government's tight monetary policy. In essence, the Canadian federal government's current austerity measures are the only way to balance and find a way out of many contradictions.

    加拿大实行经济紧缩政策
    本报记者　郭文福
    加拿大联邦政府财政部长威尔逊终于在各方强大压力之下，改变了从1991年1月1日开始在全国征收9％的商品和服务税的决定，把税率由9％降至7％。这一行动虽然暂时缓解了各方的矛盾，但加拿大政府在推行经济紧缩政策上的困难并没有减轻多少。
    今年8月，加拿大联邦政府推出新的商品和服务税的目的是要取代已经过时的制造业产品销售税。而这项经过三年半酝酿的税制改革的主要目标是要增加税收，以减少联邦政府连年的财政赤字，以及越积越高的国债。据官方统计，加拿大的国债到1988—1989财政年度已达3211亿加元，国债占国民生产总值的比例在1987—1988财政年度已达51.8％。连年的赤字和巨额的国债已成为加拿大经济的沉重负担。新的商品和销售税是政府为解决这一“头号经济问题”的对策之一。按照财政部长威尔逊最初9％税率的如意算盘，政府每年可增加税收240亿加元。但这么高的税收可能导致通货膨胀，遭到普遍的反对。于是，政府被迫作出让步，将税率降至7％。但这样一来，就将减少59亿加元的岁入，而政府要削弱赤字的计划又不能放弃，在这种情况下出路只有两条，一是将部分税收转移到另一部分人的身上；二是政府削减开支。
    根据最近公布的税制，资产在1000万加元以上的大企业的纳税额由0.175％增至0.2％，高收入家庭的联邦额外税由3％增至5％，原定给予小企业的每年6亿加元的管理补助取消。为此，一些对修改后的税制仍持异议的人批评政府的作法是一手掏出，另一只手又装进。
    与此同时，联邦政府也采取了一项削减政府行政开支14亿加元的措施，其中包括出售一部分联邦政府支配的专机，关闭议会大厦内的一间自助餐食堂，停用一批办公楼，减少联邦政府官员因公旅行，等等。这些措施自然会招来一些人的反对，但政府看来是要坚持实施这项计划。
    在西方国家中，加拿大经济增长是比较快的，但今年以来经济发展中出现了一系列值得注意的动向。首先是经济增长的速度下降。经济增长率从1988年的4.5％降至今年的3％。其次，加拿大中央银行的利率自今年3月份以来一直保持在12.5％左右的高水平上。三是加元对美元的汇率今年以来一直上升，到12月初已突破一加元兑换86美分的大关，创下1980年9月以来的最高纪录。四是加拿大的外贸今年10月份出现赤字，这是13年来的第一次。最后，由于需求减少，最近以加拿大几大汽车制造公司为代表，工业减产、停产、裁员现象接连发生，出现了某些经济有可能陷入衰退的迹象。尽管人们对新的一年加拿大经济是否会进入衰退还有争论，但比较一致的看法是经济增长的速度会下降。
    尽管加拿大不少经济界人士认为高利率是当前经济发展的主要障碍，但政府更为关心的是通货膨胀的问题。加拿大的通货膨胀率在1980年曾高达11.4％，1987、1988和1989年三年都降至5％以下。加拿大经济自1983年至今连续近七年保持增长势头，而通货膨胀率之所以能维持在目前这样一个低水平上，是与政府紧缩的货币政策直接有关的，可以说，加拿大联邦政府实行目前这种紧缩政策是在诸多矛盾中寻求平衡和出路的唯一选择。
