Afghan Mujahideen Reiterate the Establishment of an Islamic Government

The temporary government of the seven-party alliance in Afghanistan issued a statement on the 27th in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, saying that the Afghan Mujahideen will continue their struggle against the Kabul regime until an Islamic government is established in Afghanistan.

The statement was issued on the 10th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It pointed out that the Soviet Union should compensate Afghanistan for the war damages, as the Soviet Union is directly responsible for many of Afghanistan's losses.

The statement called on Islamic countries, all freedom-loving countries, and the international community to exert pressure on the Soviet Union to stop providing economic, political, and military aid to the Kabul regime.

    阿游击队重申建立伊斯兰政府
    阿富汗7党联盟临时政府27日在巴基斯坦西北边境省省会白沙瓦发表公报说，阿富汗游击队将继续开展反对喀布尔政权的斗争，直至在阿富汗境内建立一个伊斯兰政府。
    这项公报是在苏军入侵阿富汗10周年之际发表的。公报指出，苏联应该向阿富汗赔偿战争损失，因为苏联对阿富汗的许多损失负有直接责任。
    公报呼吁伊斯兰国家、所有热爱自由的国家以及国际社会向苏联施加压力，使苏联停止向喀布尔政权提供经济、政治和军事援助。
