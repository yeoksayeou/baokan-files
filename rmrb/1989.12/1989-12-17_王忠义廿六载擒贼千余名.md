Wang Zhongyi, who appears ordinary and has a frail build, relies on his integrity to capture over a thousand pickpockets on public buses in his 26-year career as a criminal police officer. Just last year, he caught 126 criminals on the spot, ranking first in the Public Transportation Bureau.

Last January, a partner of a detained criminal approached Wang Zhongyi, offering him 2,000 yuan to release the criminal. Wang Zhongyi, of course, refused. The man immediately glared at him: "Watch out for your wife and kids!" Wang Zhongyi slammed his fist on the table: "I'm not afraid of evil! I'm waiting for you!"

Last May, at the 20th bus stop, Wang Zhongyi noticed a man holding a child. As the bus arrived, he pushed through the crowd towards the door but did not get on the bus. When this man used the child as a cover and just pulled out an old man's wallet, Wang Zhongyi stepped forward. The thief had no choice but to hang his head and admit defeat.

Wang Zhongyi was awarded a first-class merit citation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau last year and was named a municipal labor model this year. However, his photo cannot be displayed on the honor roll or published in the newspaper because he still has many years ahead of him and will continue to deal with criminals!

    王忠义廿六载擒贼千余名
    貌不惊人体格羸弱的王忠义，凭着一身正气，在26年的刑警生涯中，降伏了千余名在公共电汽车上作案的扒手。仅去年他就当场抓获犯罪分子126名，名列公共交通分局第一。
    去年1月，一个在押犯的同伙找到王忠义，开价两千块，要他放了那犯。王忠义当然不干。那家伙立时眼露凶光：“留神你老婆孩子！”王忠义拍案而起：“我就是不信邪，我等着！”
    去年5月，在20路汽车站，王忠义发现一个抱着孩子的男人，车一来就随着涌向车门的人乱挤，却一直不上车。当此人以孩子作掩护，刚摸出一老人的钱包，王忠义一步上前。男贼不得不耷拉下脑袋认“栽”了。
    王忠义去年荣立市公安局一等功，今年被评为市劳模，可他的照片却不能上光荣榜、登报纸，因为往后的岁月还长呢，他还要与贼打交道哩！（12月8日《北京晚报》赵红文）
