Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st.

The petrochemical industry will continue to increase effective supply next year, producing more petrochemical products urgently needed for the economy and people's livelihoods, thereby easing the supply-demand gap.

This year, the China Petrochemical Corporation system overcame difficulties related to insufficient resources, funds, and transportation capacity. It is expected to complete the processing of 3% more crude oil than last year; the production of four major types of oil products will increase by 1.9% compared to last year; and the production of key products such as ethylene, plastics, synthetic fibers, synthetic ammonia, urea, and synthetic rubber will all see significant increases compared to last year. Despite the significant increase in various cost-increasing and profit-reducing factors, the China Petrochemical Corporation system is expected to achieve a profit of 15.7 billion yuan this year, completing 101.3% of the annual plan.

Recently concluded in Beijing, the 7th Manager (Factory Director) Meeting of the China Petrochemical Corporation proposed that starting next year, a comprehensive "reaching standards" campaign will be launched throughout the system. The goal is to tap into potential and gradually bring the production capacity of existing facilities up to design standards. Efforts will be made to improve the coordination of production, transportation, and sales, and to save oil in every possible way to stabilize the market. The focus will continue to be on providing key arrangements and supplies for agriculture, transportation, key projects, and key departments, especially ensuring the production and supply of agricultural diesel, fertilizers, and film materials.

    内部挖潜　保证重点
    石化工业增加有效供给
    本报北京12月21日讯　记者皮树义报道：石化工业明年将继续增加有效供给，增产国计民生急需的石化产品，缓解供需矛盾。
    今年中国石化总公司系统克服资源、资金、运力不足的困难，全年预计完成加工原油比上年增长3％；生产四大类油品比上年增长1.9％；乙烯、塑料、合成纤维、合成氨、尿素、合成橡胶等重点产品产量都比上年有较大增加。在各种增支减利因素大幅度增加的情况下，石化总公司系统全年实现利润预计将达到157亿元，完成年计划的101.3％。
    最近在北京结束的中国石油化工总公司第7次经理（厂长）会议提出：从明年开始，在全系统开展全面“达标”活动。要挖掘潜力，逐步使现有装置生产能力达到设计标准。要搞好产运销衔接和节约用油，千方百计稳定市场。继续对农业、交通运输、重点工程、重点部门给予重点安排、重点供应，特别是要优先保证农用柴油、化肥、薄膜料的生产、供应。
