Domestic B-Scan Ultrasound Machine Takes the Crown, Sparking Joy; Blind Admiration for Foreign Goods Leads to Foreign Exchange Loss, Worthy of Reflection

Experts Call for Government Departments to Protect Domestic B-Scan Ultrasound Industry

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 2 (reporter Xia Lin), the reporter learned from the State Pharmaceutical Administration that while some medical institutions in China blindly admire "foreign goods" and import large quantities of B-type ultrasound imaging machines, the World Bank recently held an international tender that produced surprising news: China's B-Scan ultrasound machine defeated competitors from the UK, the US, Japan, and other countries, securing the bid.

The World Bank decided to use loans and grants to purchase 121 units of the 400-type B-type ultrasound imaging machine for China, aiming to improve medical facilities in remote areas. For this purpose, the bank recently conducted a global tender for manufacturing enterprises. Many medical equipment companies and factories from Europe, America, and China participated in this competitive bidding. After rigorous testing, identification, and comprehensive evaluation by experts organized by the World Bank, the 400-type B-Scan ultrasound machine produced by the Tianjin Medical Electronics Instrument Company ranked first due to its reliable technical performance and reasonable sales price.

When the reporter interviewed the Equipment Department of the State Pharmaceutical Administration about this matter, the deputy director, Xu Hong, expressed both joy and concern. She said that while it is exciting that the domestic B-Scan ultrasound machine won the international bid, it is also worrying to see the current situation in China where B-Scan ultrasound machines are still being imported in large quantities blindly.

She revealed that due to the thought of blindly admiring foreign goods and the chaotic and uncontrolled import channels, in the past seven years, 700 million US dollars have been spent on importing B-Scan ultrasound machines, most of which are general-purpose products that can be completely replaced by domestic B-Scan ultrasound machines of the same type. The quality of domestic B-Scan ultrasound machines of the same type has reached the international standard of the 1980s and has begun to be exported; the production capacity can also fully meet the annual equipment needs of about 2,000 units for domestic medical institutions. In 1987, the state decided to include the B-type electronic linear scan ultrasound imaging machine in the "Catalog of Controlled Imported Mechanical and Electrical Products," but some units still went to great lengths to import from abroad, resulting in insufficient tasks for domestic manufacturing enterprises.

At the symposium on domestic B-Scan ultrasound machines replacing imports held in Tianjin on October 17, a group of experts and professors in China who are engaged in B-Scan ultrasound diagnosis and research jointly wrote a letter to the relevant leaders of the State Council, calling for the protection of the domestic B-Scan ultrasound industry.

    国产B超一举夺魁令人振奋  迷信洋货外汇流失值得反思
    专家呼吁主管部门保护国内B超工业
    据新华社北京12月2日电　（记者夏林）记者从国家医药管理局获悉，在国内一些医疗单位盲目迷信“洋货”，大量进口B型超声波显像仪的时候，世界银行新近举行的国际招标爆出新闻：中国产B超战胜英、美、日等国竞争对手，一举中标。
    世界银行决定用贷款和赠款的形式，给我国购置121台400型B型超声波显像仪，以改善边远地区医疗设施条件。为此，这家银行最近在世界范围内进行生产企业招标，欧美及中国的众多医疗器械公司和工厂参加了这场竞争角逐。经世界银行组织专家严格测试、鉴定和综合评议，天津医疗电子仪器公司生产的400型B超因具备技术性能可靠、销售价格适中等优点而位居榜首。
    记者就此事到国家医药管理局装备司采访时，装备司副司长徐虹的心境是亦喜亦忧。她说，国产B超在国际招标中夺魁，令人振奋，但面对国内仍在盲目大量进口B超的现状，却又难除忧虑。
    她透露说，由于崇洋迷外的思想加上进口渠道混乱失控，近7年来进口B超花掉7亿美元，其中绝大部分属普及型产品，完全可以由国内同类B超替代。国产同类产品，质量已达国际80年代水平，并开始出口；生产能力也完全可以满足国内医疗单位每年2000台左右的装备需要。1987年，国家就曾决定将B型电子线性扫描超声显像仪列入《控制进口的机电产品目录》，但有些单位还是千方百计从国外进口，造成国内生产企业任务不足。
    今年10月17日在天津举行的国产B超替代进口座谈会上，我国一批从事B超诊断和研制的专家教授联名给国务院有关领导同志写信，呼吁要保护国内B超工业。
