1989 was the year with the highest calls from the international community for a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue, and it was also the year when countries advocating for justice and the Cambodian resistance forces had the most intense struggle against Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime.

The international community advocates that Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision, and establish a temporary coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk, to achieve a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue. However, Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime have been vigorously obstructing the process of a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue.

On the issue of troop withdrawal, although Vietnam claimed that it had withdrawn all its troops from Cambodia on September 26, the withdrawal was conducted without international supervision. Therefore, the international community generally considers it a fraud.

Prior to this, to prevent Vietnam from deceiving the international community on the issue of troop withdrawal, from the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in early July to the Paris International Conference in August, it was repeatedly emphasized that an international supervisory body led by the United Nations must be established to supervise Vietnam's "complete withdrawal." In particular, at the Paris International Conference, specific discussions were held on the establishment of the supervisory body, and a United Nations fact-finding mission was dispatched to investigate Cambodia and its border areas to prepare for the deployment of the international supervisory body. However, Vietnam insisted on its own stance, using the excuse that "the United Nations is biased towards the Khmer Rouge, has always condemned Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, and does not recognize the Phnom Penh regime" to vigorously obstruct the establishment of an international supervisory body by the United Nations. As a result, the so-called "complete withdrawal" from Cambodia conducted by Vietnam from September 21 to 26 did not receive strict and effective international supervision, achieving the goal of "withdrawing openly but remaining secretly."

Although Vietnam has been loudly proclaiming that it has no troops left in Cambodia, the truth about its troops hidden in Cambodia has been exposed. The General Command of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea issued a statement on October 7, pointing out that after the so-called "complete withdrawal," Vietnam still has 80,000 troops remaining in Cambodia, with its main forces numbering no less than 10 divisions. A spokesman for the Sihanouk National Army revealed that large numbers of Vietnamese troops are still deployed in Phnom Penh and its surrounding areas, eastern Cambodia, the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, and strategic locations in western and northern Cambodia. In addition, Vietnam has left behind a large number of military advisors, military and technical experts, and intelligence personnel, who are distributed throughout Cambodia under the guise of "education and propaganda teams," controlling the various levels of the puppet government and strengthening local defenses. It is based on these facts that the General Assembly, on November 16, with an unprecedented overwhelming majority of 124 votes, once again passed the Cambodian resolution, exposing Vietnam's "withdrawal" tricks, declaring Vietnam's claim of "having withdrawn from Cambodia" invalid, and solemnly demanding that Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops under United Nations supervision.

On the issue of establishing Cambodia's future government, the international community has always believed that after Vietnam's true withdrawal, in order to achieve peace in Cambodia, a temporary coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk should be established. However, Vietnam, based on its own interests, vigorously advocates for the establishment of a future government with the Phnom Penh puppet regime as the main body, using all means to exclude the Khmer Rouge. In early May, Hun Sen attempted to use the bait of "allowing Sihanouk to return to Cambodia to assume a leadership position" to form a government with the puppet regime as the main body, excluding the Khmer Rouge, which was rejected by Prince Sihanouk. Later, at the Paris International Conference, when most of the participating countries again proposed discussing the establishment of a four-party government, Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime once again played the old tune of the Khmer Rouge's "genocide," which was refuted by the representatives of the participating countries. Some representatives pointed out at the meeting that the meaning of "genocide" in international law refers to foreign invaders exterminating an oppressed nation, and the Khmer Rouge does not belong to this category. Those who belong to this category should be Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia. Vietnam still insists on its stubborn stance, making it impossible to make progress on the issue of establishing Cambodia's future government. However, the international community has not abandoned its just cause. This year's General Assembly resolution once again emphasized the need to establish a temporary coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk.

Vietnam is extremely dissatisfied with the General Assembly's resolution on the Cambodian issue this year, especially the resolution's stance on the above two key issues, accusing it of being a "wrong resolution," "obstructing the fair resolution of the Cambodian issue," and making the Cambodian issue "stagnate," etc. This once again shows that Vietnam's stance on the above issues is far removed from the general consensus of the international community.

Under Vietnam's vigorous obstruction of a comprehensive political solution, the Cambodian national resistance forces have intensified their armed struggle, seizing some counties and strategic locations since the end of September. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea captured the important town of Banteay Meas and the county of Tboung Khmum in late October, controlling the 10th National Highway. In mid-November, they captured some important positions in the Melea mountain area. The Sihanouk National Army and the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces captured the counties of Tmo'b and Pursat in the northwest of Battambang Province, controlling the 69th National Highway. Recently, they have concentrated their forces to capture the "throat" of Tmo'b leading to Sisophon, as well as some enemy positions around Sisophon, aiming straight at Sisophon. In Oddar Meanchey Province, they have eliminated some enemy strongholds around the provincial capital of Anlong Veng and controlled some areas at the border between Oddar Meanchey and Battambang. To support the fighting in the border areas, the resistance forces have cut off the 5th and 6th National Highways connecting Phnom Penh to the western border areas and blown up important bridges. Currently, the victories are further expanding, and the liberated areas in the western and northern regions have connected into one piece.

Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime are in a state of panic. On October 26, the Phnom Penh regime imposed a curfew in Battambang City. Four days later, a curfew was also imposed in Phnom Penh. In mid-to-late November, Vietnam dispatched another 7,000 troops to Battambang Province.

It can be predicted that the future development of the situation in Cambodia will be characterized by fighting while talking, and it is too early to hope that one or two international conferences can solve the problem.

### 障碍仍在　僵持依旧——1989年柬埔寨问题的解决未取得实质进展

    障碍仍在　僵持依旧
    ——1989年柬埔寨问题的解决未取得实质进展
    本报记者　刘爱成
    1989年，是国际社会要求全面政治解决柬埔寨问题呼声最高的一年，也是世界主持正义的国家和柬埔寨抵抗力量同越南及金边政权斗争最激烈的一年。
    国际社会主张，越南必须在严格有效的国际监督下真正从柬撤出全部军队，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的柬四方临时联合政府，以实现柬问题的全面政治解决。而越南和金边政权则竭力阻碍全面政治解决柬问题的进程。
    在撤军问题上，越南虽然宣称今年9月26日已从柬撤出全部军队，但撤军是在没有国际监督的情况下进行的，因而国际社会普遍认为是一场骗局。
    在此之前，国际社会为防止越南在撤军问题上弄虚作假，从7月初的东盟外长会议到8月间的巴黎国际会议，都一再强调：必须建立一个由联合国领导的国际监督机构来监督越南的“全部撤军”。尤其是在巴黎国际会议上，专门就组建监督机构问题进行了具体讨论，并派出联合国实地调查组在柬埔寨及其边境地区进行调查，为派遣国际监督机构作准备。但越南固持己见，以“联合国偏袒红色高棉，历来谴责越侵柬，不承认金边政权”为借口，竭力阻挠由联合国出面组建国际监督机构，从而使它在9月21—26日进行的所谓从柬“全部撤军”未受到严格有效的国际监督，达到了“明撤暗留”的目的。
    虽然越南大肆宣传它在柬已无一兵一卒，但它藏兵于柬的真相已为事实所戳穿。民柬国民军司令部10月7日发表声明指出，越南在所谓“全部撤军”后，仍有8万军队留在柬内，其主力不少于10个师。西哈努克民族军发言人揭露，大批越军仍部署在金边及金边周围地区、柬东及柬越边境和柬西、北战略要地。此外，越南还留下大批军事顾问、军备技术专家和情报人员等，他们以“教育宣传队”的名义分布在柬埔寨各地，控制柬伪各级政权和加强地方防卫。正是基于这样的事实，联大于11月16日以124票的空前压倒多数，再次通过了柬问题决议，揭露了越南“撤军”花招，宣布越南所谓“已从柬撤军”无效，严正要求越南必须在联合国监督下真正撤出全部军队。
    在建立柬未来政府问题上，国际社会一直认为，在越南真正撤军之后，为了在柬埔寨实现和平，应该建立一个由西哈努克亲王领导的四方临时联合政府。但越南却从它的自身利益出发，竭力主张建立以金边傀儡政权为主体的未来政权，不择手段地排斥红色高棉。今年5月初，洪森与西哈努克在雅加达会谈时，企图以“让西哈努克回柬担任国家领导人”为诱饵，组建以伪政权为主、不包括红色高棉的政府，遭到西哈努克亲王的拒绝。此后，在巴黎国际会议上，当大多数与会国家再次提出讨论建立四方政府问题时，越南、金边政权又重弹红色高棉“灭绝种族”老调，遭到与会国代表们的反驳。一些代表在会上指出，国际法上的“灭绝种族”含义是指外国侵略者消灭一个被压迫民族而言，红色高棉不属此类性质。属于此类性质的应该是侵略柬埔寨的越南。越南仍坚持顽固立场，致使组建柬未来政府问题无法取得进展。然而，国际社会并没有因此而放弃正义主张。本届联大决议再次强调要建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。
    越南对本届联大关于柬问题的决议，尤其是决议在上述两个关键性问题的立场极为不满，指责它是“错误的决议”，“阻挠了柬问题的公正解决”，使柬问题“陷入僵局”等等。这再次表明越南在上述问题上的立场与国际社会的普遍主张相去甚远。
    在越南竭力阻挠全面政治解决的情况下，柬民族抵抗力量加强了武装斗争，自9月底以来夺取了一些县城和战略要地。民柬国民军10月下旬攻占了拜林重镇和三洛县城，控制了10号公路。11月中旬又攻占了梅莱山区的一些重要阵地。西哈努克民族军和高棉人民民族解放军在马德望省西北部先后攻占了特莫博和普怀斯罗县城，控制了69号公路。最近又集中兵力，攻占特莫博通往诗梳风的“咽喉”——斯外则，以及诗梳风周围的一些敌人阵地，目标直指诗梳风。在奥多棉吉省，他们拔除了省会三隆市周围的一些敌人据点，并控制了该省与马德省交界处的一些地区。为配合边境地区的战斗，抵抗力量已在内地切断了金边通往西部边境地区的5、6号公路，炸毁了重要桥梁。目前战果进一步扩大，西、北地区的解放区已连成一片。
    对此，越南及金边政权惊恐不安。10月26日，金边政权在马德望市实施戒严。四天后，又在金边市实行宵禁。11月中上旬，越南又向马德望省增派了7000名越军。
    可以预料，柬埔寨今后局势的发展特点将是边打边谈，寄希望一两次国际会议就能解决问题尚为时过早。
