    国务院向人大常委会提交议案
    提请审议批准中土领事条约
    新华社北京12月20日电　国务院总理李鹏向今天召开的七届全国人大常委会第11次会议提交了国务院关于提请审议批准中华人民共和国和土耳其共和国领事条约的议案。
    议案说，中华人民共和国和土耳其共和国领事条约，已由外交部副部长齐怀远和土耳其外交部次长纽斯海特·康代米尔于1989年3月6日分别代表本国在北京签署。这个条约是中土双方在各自提出的条约草案基础上，经过友好谈判达成协议的。经审核，该条约的各项规定符合我国现行的法律、法规和政策，也符合中土两国的实际情况。
    在今天的会议上，外交部副部长田曾佩受国务院委托就这个条约作了说明。他说，为适应中土两国政治、经济、贸易、科技、文化及旅游关系的进一步发展，签订双边领事条约是适时和必要的。国务院于1988年5月10日批准同意与土签订领事条约，6月16日我国向土耳其递交了中方草案。
    田曾佩说，中土领事条约符合我国法律和法规、中土两国实际情况和国际惯例。
