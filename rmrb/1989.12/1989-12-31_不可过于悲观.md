	No Need to Be Too Pessimistic
	He Maowen, Nanchang, Jiangxi

	Facing the rapidly increasing population pressure, the Earth seems to be getting smaller and smaller, and arable land is particularly scarce. Over the past 40 years, China's population has doubled, while the amount of arable land per capita has been halved. This situation has caused concern among people, and some have become pessimistic about this development trend. I believe there is no need to be. Studying the land issue is essentially studying the relationship between land and people. On this issue, three basic viewpoints need to be clarified. First, humans are the masters of the land. Humans can destroy land, reduce its quality, and decrease the amount of arable land, or they can protect and develop the land, making it more obedient to human will and useful to humans. Second, the limited quantity of land, especially arable land, and the unlimited growth of the population are developing in opposite directions. The more the population increases, the more industrial and living spaces encroach on arable land, and the less arable land there is per person, becoming a prominent social problem. Finally, the relatively unlimited potential of land. Land has the ability to regenerate; as long as it is well cultivated, its quality will improve, and its production potential can be continuously tapped.

	40 years ago, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson once claimed that the Chinese government would not be able to solve the problem of feeding so many people. The development of practice has refuted this prediction. China has solved the problem of feeding 22% of the world's population with less than 7% of the world's arable land, and has doubled the production of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton on the reduced arable land. Looking at the agriculturally developed countries in the world, the Netherlands has only 7 mu of arable land per capita, and its natural conditions are not as good as China's, but it has met the needs of a dense population and has become the world's fourth-largest exporter of agricultural products in 1987, with exports totaling $2.5 billion. The Dutch miracle can be achieved in socialist China. Therefore, there is no need to be too pessimistic about the land issue. Pessimism will only cause people to lose confidence and courage to move forward.

	The way out now is: on the one hand, we must highly regard the severe reality of arable land decreasing year by year; on the other hand, we must make scientific and correct choices. This choice, in my opinion, needs to open up new ideas in both increasing supply and saving resources, and focus on the six characters "protection, transformation, and development." First, we must seriously protect existing arable land. Protecting existing arable land is a fundamental national policy, and its important strategic significance should be on a par with family planning, population control, and forest protection; we must establish a firm mindset of cherishing land like gold among all the people. At the same time, actively promote the use of economic means to protect and manage arable land, combining land occupation with land creation, and using land to support land, that is, using the tax revenue from land acquisition to reward land creation, and using land creation to make up for construction land. Make the occupation of arable land a truly mandatory plan, thereby strictly controlling the reduction of arable land. Second, we must actively improve the quality of arable land. Third, we must explore new agricultural land and not just focus on the limited arable land.

专栏：怎样珍惜每寸土地？

    不可过于悲观
    江西省南昌市　何茂文
    对于急剧增长的人口压力来说，地球正在显得越来越狭小，耕地尤其显得紧缺。40年来，我国的人口翻了一番，人均占有的耕地则减少了一半。这种状况，引起了人们的忧虑，甚至有人对这种发展态势感到悲观。我认为是没有必要的。研究土地问题，实质是研究土地与人的关系。对这个问题，需要明确三个基本观点。首先，人是土地的主人。人类可以破坏土地，降低土地的质量，减少耕地数量，也可以保护土地，发展土地，使土地更顺从地听命于人类，为人类所利用。其次，土地特别是耕地的数量的有限性和人口发展的无限性呈反向发展，人口愈增，工业和生活占用耕地越多，人均耕地越少，成为突出的社会问题。最后，土地潜力的相对无限性。土地有再生能力，只要培育得好，质量会提高，生产潜力就可以不断地发挥出来。
    40年前，美国国务卿艾奇逊曾断言中国政府无法解决众多人口的吃饭问题。实践的发展，打破了这种预言，我国以不到世界7％的耕地解决了占世界22％的人口吃饭，在减少了的耕地面积上，实现了粮食、棉花等主要农产品的翻番。再从世界上农业发达的国家来看，荷兰人均只占有7分耕地，自然条件并不如我国强，却满足了密集的人口需要，并且在1987年即以出口250亿美元农产品、成为世界上农产品的第四出口大国。荷兰的奇迹，在社会主义的中国完全可以实现。由此，对于土地问题，大可不必过于悲观，悲观只会使人丧失信心，失去前进的勇气。
    现在的出路是：一方面我们要高度正视耕地逐年减少的严峻现实；另一方面则要作出科学的正确选择，这种选择，我认为需要在开源节流上打开眼界，重点在“保护、改造、开发”六个字上大作文章。第一，要认真保护现有耕地。保护现有耕地是国家的基本国策，其重要战略意义，当与计划生育，控制人口，保护森林相提并论；要在全体人民群众中树立惜地如金的牢固思想。同时，积极推行用经济手段保护和管理耕地的办法，使占地与造地相结合，以地养地，即以征地的税收奖励造地，以造地弥补建设用地。使耕地的占用，成为真正的指令性计划，从而严格控制耕地的减少。第二，要积极改造提高耕地质量。第三，要开拓新的农业用地，不能老盯着有限的耕地。
