Today, we are holding a grand National Science and Technology Awards Conference to honor scientists and experts who have made outstanding contributions to China's scientific and technological progress. This is also a review of the outstanding scientific and technological achievements made in China in recent years. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, I extend my warm congratulations and highest respects to the award-winning comrades, to the representatives present, and to all the scientific and technological workers across the country!

China now has a scientific and technological army of nearly a million people. Together with other intellectuals, they form an important part of the working class. This army has inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of revolutionary forerunners and the older generation of scientists. They are loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the cause of socialism. They have the spirit of selfless dedication to the prosperity of the motherland and the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. They have the precious qualities of daring to scale heights and fight hard battles. This army has gone through long-term struggles and truly belongs to the elite of the Chinese nation. We are proud to have such a high-quality, high-level scientific and technological team.

Awarding scientific and technological progress is an important policy that our Party and government have long adhered to, and it is an important measure to promote the cause of science and technology. Of course, only a few comrades have received awards, but the dedication and hard work of the vast majority of scientific and technological workers, as nameless heroes, are precious contributions that have been integrated into the great cause of our Party and the people. The achievements of every scientific and technological worker, whether or not they have received awards, will be remembered by the people and forever recorded in the glorious history of the motherland's progress.

I would like to take this opportunity to share some thoughts on scientific and technological work and discuss them with everyone.

1. The Key Role of Technological Progress in Socialist Modernization Construction

Science and technology are great practices of humanity and a revolutionary force that has played a driving role in history. In modern times, technological progress has an increasingly decisive role in the development of social productive forces and is having a broad and profound impact on various aspects of human society. Major global issues such as resources, environment, ecology, and population cannot be solved without the progress of science and technology. Global economic competition and comprehensive national strength competition are, to a large extent, competitions in science and technology. Nations and peoples that have long lagged behind in science and technology cannot prosper and cannot stand tall among the nations of the world.

Eleven years ago, when our Party called on the people of the whole country to strive for the Four Modernizations, Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered a speech of profound significance at the National Science Conference. He eloquently expounded on the Marxist view that science and technology are productive forces. He emphasized: "The Four Modernizations, the key is the modernization of science and technology. Without modern science and technology, it is impossible to build modern agriculture, modern industry, and modern national defense." Comrade Xiaoping's speech laid the theoretical foundation for China to formulate basic policies and guidelines for the development of science and technology in the new era. Recently, Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly pointed out in discussions on economic development: science and technology are the primary productive forces; science is a great thing, and we must attach importance to science, and ultimately, science may solve problems. These propositions further elucidate the important position and great role of science and technology.

China is still a developing country with a large population, a weak foundation, and limited per capita resources. Economic and cultural backwardness are long-term constraints on economic and social development. Under these historical conditions, we are carrying out socialist modernization construction. To significantly improve labor productivity and the material and cultural living standards of the people, we must make arduous efforts to promote the progress of science and technology. Modern science and technology are undergoing profound revolutions. To vigorously develop China's science and technology, to gradually narrow the gap with developed countries as a whole, and to strive to catch up with and approach the world's advanced level, is an urgent task facing the entire Party, the people of all ethnic groups, and the people of the whole country. We must adhere to the strategic position of giving priority to the development of science and technology and rely on technological progress to improve economic and social benefits. Only by developing science and technology can we achieve twice the results with half the effort. The national policy formulated by the Party and the government based on China's national conditions and the trend of contemporary scientific and technological development must be firmly established in the minds of cadres at all levels, implemented in practice, and adhered to for a long time.

In the past forty years, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's economic and social development has achieved tremendous success, to a large extent, thanks to technological progress. Before the founding of New China, China had fewer than 50,000 scientific and technological personnel, of whom fewer than 500 were engaged in scientific research, and there were only about 30 specialized scientific research institutions. Scientific research work was mainly classified research combined with China's natural conditions and resource characteristics; industrial production technology was very backward; agricultural production remained at the traditional backward methods of several thousand years; modern science and technology was almost a blank. After the founding of New China, we have trained a scientific and technological team of 9.6 million people, including about 700,000 with senior titles. We have established a scientific and technological system with relatively complete disciplines, developed more than 5,200 independent research institutions, and more than 5,000 research institutions affiliated to enterprises and colleges and universities. In the past ten years, we have made significant progress in organizing major scientific and technological research projects, applying and promoting scientific and technological achievements, promoting scientific and technological progress in enterprises and rural areas, carrying out high-tech research, developing high-tech industries, strengthening basic research, and developing international scientific and technological cooperation and exchanges. Now, China's scientific and technological work has initially formed a layout of three levels: facing the main battlefield of economic construction, tracking high-tech research and promoting its industrial development, and strengthening basic research. The mechanism and pattern of scientific and technological work have undergone profound changes, with greatly enhanced vitality, promoting the combination of science and technology with the economy, and promoting the development of the cause of science and technology itself. We now have a relatively strong scientific and technological research capability, and in some fields, we have approached or reached the world's advanced level. We basically have the ability to solve major scientific and technological problems in economic construction and national defense construction with our own strength. Our scientific and technological progress has made a great contribution to China's current modernization construction and has laid a solid foundation for future development.

Reviewing the great achievements of the past forty years, we deeply miss the late revolutionary leaders Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and scientists Guo Moruo, Li Siguang, Zhu Kezhen, Mao Yisheng, Hua Luogeng. We sincerely thank the living revolutionary leaders Deng Xiaoping, Nie Rongzhen, and scientists Yan Jici, Zhou Peiyuan, Qian Xuesen. We, all scientific and technological workers and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, will forever remember their outstanding contributions to the creation of New China's scientific and technological cause.

2. Main Experiences in the Development of Science and Technology in China

The socialist system has liberated science and technology from the shackles of private ownership, transforming them from tools used by the exploiting class to oppress the people and amass wealth into truly beneficial endeavors for the broadest masses of the people. Therefore, science and technology have become a glorious cause. Science and technology, combined with the socialist system, the innovative spirit of the people, and the practice of transforming nature and society, have gained vigorous vitality and produced the great power to create miracles.

What are the main experiences in the development of science and technology in China over the past forty years, especially in the past ten years?

First, adhere to the strategic policy of scientific and technological work serving economic construction and economic construction relying on scientific and technological progress. There are many disciplines in science and technology, and the objects of service are wide-ranging, but serving economic construction must be given priority. Economic construction must solve all major problems, which cannot be separated from technological progress. Science and technology can only fully play their role and have a broad prospect by closely combining with economic construction. We must truly start from reality and act according to objective laws to achieve success in the development of various undertakings in the economy and society. This is a basic link to ensure the scientific nature of decision-making, planning, management, and implementation. We must fully listen to the opinions of scientific and technological workers.

Second, adhere to the principle of self-reliance as the mainstay and international cooperation as a supplement. We firmly believe in the wisdom and creative abilities of the scientific and technological workers of the Chinese nation. We strive to carry forward the spirit of national self-respect and self-confidence, advocate collectivism, patriotism, and socialist and communist ideology, and on the basis of independence and self-reliance, adhere to reform and opening up. Actively absorb the advanced achievements and experiences of scientific and technological development from all over the world, introduce technology, and introduce talents. From the actual situation of China, carry out digestion, absorption, improvement, and innovation. It is precisely by adhering to this principle that China's own scientific and technological strength has grown and developed healthily.

Third, adhere to the scientific organization of forces, strengthen macro guidance and rational allocation, distinguish between light and heavy, urgent and non-urgent, and carry out collective research. Under the socialist system, we have the conditions to plan and coordinate, concentrate collective wisdom, give full play to individual strengths, and complete major scientific and technological tasks in national economic and national defense construction. It is through effective organizational work that China's nuclear technology and man-made satellite and carrier rocket technology have developed from nothing to gradually catching up with the world's advanced level.

Fourth, adhere to the combination of reform and development, promote development through reform, and deepen reform in development. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, in reforming and improving the leadership and management system of science and technology, in developing the cause of science and technology, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made a series of major decisions, promulgated a series of policies, guidelines, and regulations, which should continue to be implemented and further improved.

Fifth, adhere to the combination of scientific and technological personnel with practice, with workers and peasants, with popularization and improvement, with the research work of experts and technicians and the mass technological innovation and technological transformation, and in this process, concentrate the experience and creativity of the masses to improve the level of science and technology, promote scientific and technological achievements and popularize scientific knowledge to improve the scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation. This is a vivid manifestation of the Party's mass line in scientific and technological work.

Sixth, adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and create a good environment and atmosphere for technological progress. Encourage and support scientific and technological workers to propose new theories, establish new schools of thought, and explore new fields on the basis of seeking truth from facts. Encourage different schools of thought and different academic viewpoints to contend, carry out comradely discussions, and jointly promote the prosperity of science and technology. We oppose the use of administrative means to interfere with academic freedom, arbitrarily judge academic issues, and draw conclusions. The truth and falsehood in the field of science will ultimately be tested by practice.

I have only briefly listed some of the main experiences here. These experiences are the crystallization of the hard work of the broad masses of scientific and technological workers and the joint creation of the Party, scientific and technological workers, and the people of the whole country. Of course, I am not saying that everything we have done over the past forty years is good. We have had the joy of success and the pain of setbacks. However, when we act according to the above experiences, our scientific and technological cause and economic construction can develop more smoothly. History has proven that these experiences are correct. We should continue to adhere to and enrich these experiences in new practices.

3. The Main Tasks of Scientific and Technological Work for Economic Construction at Present

Scientific and technological work for economic construction should be based on the present and look to the future. We should organize scientific and technological forces to make every effort to contribute to the implementation of the various tasks of further rectification and deepening reform determined by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. At the same time, we should accumulate strength and create conditions for the realization of the second and third strategic goals of China's economic development.

We must rely on technological progress to revitalize agriculture. Localities should, according to the level of economic and cultural development, natural conditions, and farming characteristics, firmly grasp the link of technological progress, and strive to improve agricultural labor productivity, increase the yield per unit area of crops, and make effective use of resources. On the one hand, we must vigorously promote the application and popularization of advanced and applicable scientific and technological achievements to quickly form scale benefits; on the other hand, we must strengthen the research and development of major scientific and technological projects to ensure the momentum of agricultural and rural economic development. The focus of rural scientific and technological work should be shifted to the introduction, demonstration, and promotion of advanced and applicable scientific and technological achievements, and to establish and improve various forms of agricultural technology promotion and service organizations, further stabilize and strengthen the rural scientific and technological team. Efforts should be made to open up sources of funds and increase scientific and technological investment. We must promote the development of rural production towards moderate-scale management and specialization and socialization, and guide the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road of technological enrichment and common prosperity.

We must rely on technological progress to improve the technical level and management level of industry. We must give full play to the guiding role of the state plan, organize a lean scientific and technological force to solve major engineering and technological problems of the whole situation. We must continue to promote the technological progress of industrial enterprises. Large and medium-sized enterprises and enterprise groups should establish and improve the technical development and production technology management system led by the factory director and responsible by the chief engineer, and establish and improve the technical development institutions. Small enterprises and township enterprises should also form their own technical support in various ways. Various departments and localities should, according to the characteristics of the industry, establish indicators for the evaluation of enterprise technological progress and strictly carry out the evaluation. Under the guidance of the national industrial policy, we should plan and strengthen technological transformation, change the situation of low-level expansion of production capacity and scattered duplication of facilities, and improve comprehensive economic benefits and overall technical level. We should focus on promoting scientific and technological achievements that have a significant impact on the development of basic industries such as energy, transportation, and raw materials, and strive to promote energy conservation and emission reduction, improve product quality, and reduce environmental pollution. Technological introduction should strengthen macro guidance and management, overcome the phenomena of emphasizing equipment over technology, emphasizing production and use over digestion and absorption, and blind and unnecessary repeated introduction. We must organize scientific and technological forces to do a good job in the feasibility study of introduced projects, especially major projects, and do a good job in the digestion, absorption, and localization of introduced technologies, and innovate on a high starting point to enhance self-development capabilities. We should encourage scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, and large and medium-sized enterprises to give full play to their scientific and technological advantages, cooperate with each other, and work together.

We must rely on China's scientific and technological strength to vigorously carry out the research and development of high and new technologies, use high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and plan and organize the development of high and new technology industries. This is of great significance for adjusting the industrial structure, promoting the technological transformation of traditional industries, significantly improving labor productivity, and enhancing international competitiveness. We should support the implementation of the development plan for high and new technology industries in terms of funds and materials, and continue to support the development of existing high and new technology industry development experimental zones. We should encourage scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, and enterprises to cooperate; units with conditions can establish science and technology development-type enterprises to produce high and new technology products. Relevant departments should work closely together to promote the international development of high and new technology industries and create conditions for high and new technology products to enter the international market. At the same time, we should closely follow and track the development trends of world science and technology, and seriously implement and continuously improve the high and new technology research and development plan.

We must support basic scientific research and enhance the momentum of scientific and technological development. Although this work does not immediately show economic benefits, it will inevitably have a major impact on the long-term development of science and technology and the economy, and we must always attach great importance to it and implement policies to ensure its sustained and stable development. We must increase the investment intensity of basic scientific research and ensure the stability of medium and long-term exploratory scientific research work. We should support a number of basic scientific research institutions with key focus and further improve the national laboratories and postdoctoral research stations. We should encourage the exchange of scientific and technological personnel among scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, and enterprises, and focus on cultivating a new generation of academic leaders.

Science and technology must develop, and talent is the key. We must create conditions to encourage scientific and technological workers to persevere in advancing into the depths and breadths of modern science and technology and continue to climb the peaks of world scientific and technological development. We must focus on the popularization of science and technology, actively carry out mass technological innovation and invention activities, and improve the scientific and technological quality of the broad masses of workers. We must start from the youth, create and maintain a strong atmosphere of loving science, learning science, and using science among the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and cultivate a vast army of scientific and technological reserves with socialist consciousness and armed with modern scientific and technological knowledge.

4. Strengthening and Improving the Party's Leadership over Scientific and Technological Work

The socialist modernization construction has opened up a broad horizon for the development and prosperity of the cause of science and technology. Strengthening and improving the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work, formulating and implementing correct policies, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific and technological workers, and using all scientific and technological achievements to serve the people and the cause of socialism, is a historical responsibility that our Party must fulfill.

All levels of party and government departments should put scientific and technological work on the important agenda, timely understand and grasp the development of science and technology in their departments and regions, often discuss the policies, plans, and measures for the development of science and technology, study and solve the problems and difficulties encountered in the development of science and technology, and summarize and promote the good experiences and typical examples of the development of science and technology. We must adhere to the respect for knowledge and respect for talents, and form this good custom in the whole society.

All levels of party and government leaders should organize relevant departments and units to work closely together, coordinate and cooperate, and jointly promote technological progress. The scientific and technological management department should strengthen comprehensive management; the planning department should strengthen the work of scientific and technological planning and coordinate it with the planning of economic and social development; the financial department should gradually increase the input of science and technology within its capacity; the financial department should strive to solve the problem of funds needed for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into direct production capacity; the tax department should further formulate tax policies to encourage technological progress. We should strive to improve the efficiency of the use of manpower, financial resources, and materials.

We must continue to strengthen the construction of the scientific and technological team and continuously improve the ideological and political level and professional level of scientific and technological workers. We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, which naturally includes intellectuals as part of the working class. Our scientific and technological workers should strive to become experts proficient in their business, consciously adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and closely link their careers with socialist modernization construction, with the destiny of the nation and the future of the country. We should, according to the characteristics of scientific and technological work, warmly care about the growth and progress of scientific and technological personnel, encourage them to master the epistemology and methodology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in scientific and technological practice. We should continue to develop party members from outstanding scientific and technological personnel and select cadres. Party and government leaders at all levels should often listen to the suggestions, opinions, and voices of scientific and technological workers, seriously solve the practical problems existing in their study, work, and life, respect them, understand them, and love them, and be their confidants.

Comrades, the Party and the government attach great importance to the cause of science and technology, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country are eagerly looking forward to the progress of science and technology and have high hopes for the scientific and technological workers of the whole country. We believe that all scientists, experts, and technical personnel who love the motherland will, under the guidance of the Party's basic line, make new and greater contributions to the prosperity of China's economy, the overall progress of society, the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the common happiness of the people!

    推动科技进步是全党全民的历史性任务
    ——在国家科学技术奖励大会上的讲话
    （一九八九年十二月十九日）
    江泽民
    同志们：
    今天，我们在这里隆重举行国家科学技术奖励大会，表彰为我国科学技术进步做出突出贡献的科学家和专家，同时也是对我国近年来所取得的优秀科技成果的一次检阅。我代表党中央、国务院、中央军委，向获奖的同志，向到会的代表，向全国各条战线的科技工作者，表示热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意！
    我国已经有一支近千万人的科技大军，他们同其他知识分子一道，构成工人阶级的重要组成部分。这支大军，继承、发扬革命先辈和老一辈科学家的优良传统，忠于祖国，忠于人民，忠于社会主义事业，具有为祖国强盛而艰苦奋斗的献身精神，具有实事求是的科学态度，具有勇攀高峰、能打硬仗的可贵品格。这支大军，经历了长期斗争的考验，真正属于中华民族的精英。我们为有这样一支素质好、水平高的科技队伍而骄傲。
    奖励科学技术进步，是我们党和政府长期坚持的一项重要制度，是促进科技事业的一项重要政策。当然，获得奖励的毕竟只是少数同志，大量科技工作者的赤子之心和辛勤劳动，都作为无名英雄的珍贵贡献，融汇于我们党和人民的伟大事业之中。每一位科技工作者的功绩，无论是否获得奖励，都将铭记在人民心中，永远载入祖国进步的光辉史册。
    我想借此机会，就科技工作讲几点意见，同大家一起商讨。
      一、科技进步在社会主义现
  代化建设中的关键作用
    科学技术是人类的伟大实践之一，是一种在历史上起推动作用的革命的力量。在现代，科技进步对社会生产力发展越来越具有决定性的作用，并且正在人类社会生活的各个领域发生广泛而深刻的影响。全球面临的资源、环境、生态、人口等重大问题的解决，都离不开科学技术的进步。世界范围的经济竞争、综合国力竞争，在很大程度上表现为科学技术的竞争。科学技术长期落后的国家和民族，不可能繁荣昌盛，不可能自立于世界民族之林。
    11年前，在我们党号召全国人民为实现四个现代化而奋斗的时候，邓小平同志在全国科学大会上，发表了具有深远意义的讲话，精辟地阐述了科学技术是生产力的马克思主义观点。他强调指出：“四个现代化，关键是科学技术现代化。没有现代科学技术，就不可能建设现代农业、现代工业、现代国防。”小平同志的这篇讲话，为我国在新时期制定发展科学技术的基本方针和政策，奠定了思想理论基础。最近，小平同志在谈到经济发展时又一再指出：科学技术是第一生产力；科学是了不起的事情，要重视科学，最终可能是科学解决问题。这些论断，进一步阐明了科学技术的重要地位和巨大作用。
    我国还是一个发展中国家，人口多，底子薄，人均资源少，经济文化比较落后，这些都是经济和社会发展中的长期制约因素。我们在这种历史条件下进行社会主义现代化建设，要大幅度提高劳动生产率，提高人民群众的物质文化生活水平，必须在推动科学技术的进步上付出艰苦的努力。现代科学技术正在经历着深刻的革命，大力发展我国的科学技术，从总体上逐步缩短同发达国家的差距，努力接近和赶上世界先进水平，是摆在全党全国各族人民面前的一项紧迫任务。我们要坚持把科学技术放在优先发展的战略地位，坚持依靠科技进步来提高经济效益和社会效益。只有发展科技，才能事半功倍。党和政府根据我国国情和当代科学技术发展的趋势确定的这项国策，必须在各级干部的思想上牢固树立起来，切实贯彻执行，长期坚持下去。
    四十年来，特别是十一届三中全会以来，我国经济和社会发展的巨大成就，在很大程度上是依靠科技进步取得的。新中国成立前，我国科学技术人员不超过5万人，其中专门从事科学研究工作的不到500人，专门的科学研究机构只有30多个，科学研究工作主要是结合中国自然条件和资源特点的分类研究；工业生产技术十分陈旧；农业生产一直停留于几千年的传统落后方式；现代科学技术几乎是空白。新中国成立后，我们培养出一支960万人的科技队伍，其中有高级职称的约70万人，已建立起学科门类比较齐全的科学技术体系，独立科研机构发展到5200多个，企业和高等院校所属科研机构5000多个。近十年来，我们在组织重大科技课题攻关，应用和推广科技成果，推动企业和农村的科技进步，开展高技术研究，发展高新技术产业，加强基础性研究工作，以及发展国际科技合作交流等方面，都取得了显著进展。现在，我国科技工作已初步形成了面向经济建设主战场、跟踪高技术研究并推动其产业发展、加强基础性研究三个层次的布局，科技工作的机制和格局发生了深刻变化，活力大为增强，促进了科技与经济的结合，促进了科技事业本身的发展。我们已具有较强的科技攻关实力，在一些领域已接近或达到世界先进水平，基本具备了依靠自己力量解决经济建设、国防建设中重大科技问题的能力。我们的科技进步，为我国当前的现代化建设做出了巨大贡献，更为今后的发展奠定了坚实基础。
    回顾四十年来的巨大成就，我们深切缅怀已故的老一代革命家毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德、陈毅、李富春等同志和科学家郭沫若、李四光、竺可桢、茅以升、华罗庚等同志，衷心感谢健在的老一代革命家邓小平、聂荣臻等同志和科学家严济慈、周培源、钱学森等同志。我们全体科技工作者和全国各族人民，永远记着他们为开创新中国科技事业建立的卓著功勋。
      二、我国发展科学技术的主要经验
    社会主义制度使科学技术摆脱了私有制的桎梏而获得解放，由剥削阶级压迫人民、聚敛财富的手段，变成真正为最广大人民群众造福的事业，因此也成为无上光荣的事业。科学技术同社会主义制度结合，同人民群众历史首创精神结合，同改造自然和社会的实践结合，就获得蓬勃发展的生机，产生出创造人间奇迹的伟大力量。
    我国四十年来特别是近十年来科学技术的发展，有哪些主要经验呢？
    第一，坚持科学技术工作面向经济建设、经济建设依靠科学技术的战略方针。科学技术门类众多，服务对象广泛，但是
  为经济建设服务，要摆在首要的地位。经济建设要解决的一切重大问题，都离不开科技进步。科学技术也只有同经济建设密切结合，才能充分发挥作用和具有广阔的前景。我们要真正做到从实际出发，按照客观规律办事，取得经济和社会各项事业发展的成功，就必须充分听取科技工作者的意见。这是保证决策、规划、管理和实施的科学性的基本一环。
    第二，坚持自力更生为主、国际合作为辅。我们坚信中华民族科技工作者的智慧和创造才能，努力弘扬民族自尊心、自信心，提倡集体主义、爱国主义精神和社会主义、共产主义思想，在独立自主的基础上坚持改革开放，积极吸取世界各国科学技术发展的先进成果、先进经验，引进技术，引进人才，从我国实际出发，进行消化、吸收、提高、创新。正是坚持这一原则，才使我国自己的科技力量得以健康成长、发展壮大。
    第三，坚持科学组织力量，加强宏观指导和合理配置，分别轻重缓急，实行集体攻关。在社会主义制度下，我们完全有条件统筹规划，协同配合，集中集体智慧，发挥个人专长，完成国民经济和国防建设中提出的重大科技任务。我们正是通过卓有成效的组织工作，使我国核技术及人造卫星和运载火箭技术，从无到有，逐步发展，赶上了世界先进水平。
    第四，坚持把改革和发展密切结合起来，以改革促进发展，在发展中深化改革。十一届三中全会以来，在改革和完善科技领导体制、科技管理体制方面，在发展科技事业方面，党中央、国务院做出了一系列重大决定，颁布了一系列方针、政策、法规，要继续贯彻执行并进一步加以完善。
    第五，坚持科技人员同实践相结合，同工人、农民相结合，坚持提高和普及相结合，坚持专家、技术人员的研究工作和群众性技术革新、技术改造相结合，在这一过程中，集中群众经验和创造以提高科学技术水平，推广科技成果和普及科学知识以提高全民族科学文化素质。这是我们党的群众路线在科技工作中的生动体现。
    第六，坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，为科技进步创造良好的环境和气氛。鼓励和支持科技人员在实事求是基础上提出新理论、创立新学说、探索新领域，提倡不同学派、不同学术观点的争鸣，开展同志式的切磋讨论，共同推进科学技术的繁荣。我们反对用行政手段干预学术自由，对学术问题妄加评判，擅作结论。科学领域的真伪和是非，最终要靠实践去检验。
    我这里只是简要地列举了一些主要经验。这些经验，是广大科学技术工作者劳动心血的结晶，是党、科技工作者和全国人民的共同创造。当然，我并不是说，四十年来我们一切都做得很好。我们有过成功的欢乐，也有过遭受挫折的痛苦。但是，当我们依照上述经验去做的时候，我们的科学技术事业和经济建设，就能够比较顺利地发展。历史证明，这些经验是正确的。我们要在新的实践中继续坚持和不断丰富这些经验。三、当前科技工作为经济建设服务的主要任务
    科技工作为经济建设服务，要立足现在，着眼未来。我们要组织科技力量，全力以赴，为完成十三届五中全会确定的进一步治理整顿和深化改革的各项任务做出贡献。同时，要为实现我国经济发展的第二步、第三步战略目标，积蓄力量，创造条件。
    要依靠科技进步振兴农业。各地应根据经济文化发展水平、自然条件和耕作特点，紧紧抓住科技进步这个环节，在提高农业劳动生产率，增加农作物单位面积产量和有效利用资源上下功夫。一方面，要大力加强先进适用科技成果的推广应用，尽快形成规模效益；另一方面要加强重大科技项目的研究开发，确保农业和农村经济的发展后劲。农村科技工作的重点，要转到先进适用科技成果的引进、示范、推广上来，建立和健全多种形式的农业技术推广服务组织，进一步稳定和壮大农村科技队伍。努力开辟资金来源，增加科技投入。要推动农村生产向适度规模经营以及专业化、社会化方向发展，引导广大农民群众走科技致富和共同富裕的社会主义道路。
    要依靠科技进步提高工业的技术水平和经营管理水平。要发挥国家计划的指导作用，组织精干科技力量，解决全局性的重大工程技术问题。要继续推动工业企业的技术进步。大中型企业和企业集团，应建立和完善厂长领导下由总工程师负责的技术开发和生产技术管理体系，建立和健全技术开发机构。小企业和乡镇企业也应以多种方式形成自己的技术依托。各部门和地方要根据行业特点，建立企业技术进步的考核指标，严格进行考核。要在国家产业政策的指导下，统筹规划，大力加强技术改造，改变低水平扩大生产能力、分散重复铺摊子的状况，提高综合经济效益和整体技术水平。要重点推广对能源、交通、原材料等基础工业的发展有重大影响的科技成果，并努力促进节能降耗、提高产品质量、减少环境污染。技术引进要加强宏观指导和管理，克服重设备轻技术、重生产使用轻消化吸收，以及盲目引进和不必要的重复引进等现象。必须组织科技力量，做好引进项目特别是重大项目的可行性研究，做好引进技术的消化吸收和国产化工作，在高起点上创新，增强自主开发能力。要鼓励科研机构、高等院校和大中型企业发挥自己的科技优势，互相联合，协同工作。
    要依靠我国科技力量，大力研究开发高新技术，用高新技术改造传统产业，有计划有组织地发展高新技术产业。这对于调整产业结构，推动传统产业技术改造，大幅度提高劳动生产率，增强国际竞争能力，具有重大意义。要从资金、物资上支持高新技术产业发展计划的实施，继续扶植现有高新技术产业开发试验区的发展。鼓励科研机构、高等院校与企业结合；有条件的单位，可以兴办科技开发型企业，生产高新技术产品。有关方面应紧密配合，努力促进高新技术产业走国际化的发展道路，为高新技术产品进入国际市场创造条件。同时，要密切注视和跟踪世界科技发展趋势，认真实施并不断完善高新技术研究发展计划。
    要支持基础性科学研究，增强科技发展后劲。这项工作虽然暂时看不到经济效益，但是势必对科技和经济的长远发展产生重大影响，一定要始终给予高度重视，实行保证其持续稳定发展的政策。要切实增加基础性科学研究的投资强度，确保中长期的探索性科研工作的稳定性。有重点地支持一批基础性科学研究机构，并进一步办好国家实验室和博士后流动站。要鼓励科研单位、高等院校、企业间科技人员的交流，抓紧培养新一代学术带头人。
    科技要发展，人才是关键。要尽可能创造条件，鼓励科技人员坚韧不拔地向现代科学技术的深度和广度进军，继续攀登世界科技发展的高峰。要抓好科技普及工作，积极开展群众性技术革新和创造发明活动，提高广大劳动者的科学技术素质。要从青少年抓起，在全国各族人民中，造成和保持爱科学、学科学、用科学的浓厚空气，造就有社会主义觉悟的、用现代科学技术知识武装起来的浩浩荡荡的科技后备大军。
    四、加强和改善党对科技工作的领导
    社会主义现代化建设为科学技术事业的发展和繁荣开辟了广阔的天地。加强和改善党对科技工作的领导，制定和实施正确的政策，充分发挥科技人员的积极性和创造性，运用一切科学技术成果为人民服务、为社会主义事业服务，是我们党必须履行的历史责任。
    各级党政部门要把科技工作列入重要议事日程，及时了解和掌握本部门、本地区科技发展的情况，经常讨论科技发展政策、计划和措施，研究和解决科技发展中遇到的问题和困难，总结和推广科技发展的好经验、好典型。要坚持尊重知识、尊重人才，在全社会形成这种良好的风尚。
    各级党政领导要组织有关部门和有关单位，密切配合，协调一致，共同促进科技进步。科技主管部门要加强综合管理；计划部门要加强科技计划工作，并使其与经济、社会发展计划相协调；财政部门要在力所能及的范围内逐步增加对科技的投入；金融部门要努力解决科技成果转化为直接生产能力所必需的资金问题；税务部门要进一步制定鼓励科技进步的税收政策。要努力提高人力、财力、物力的使用效益。
    要继续抓好科技队伍的建设，不断提高科技工作者的思想政治水平和业务水平。全心全意地依靠工人阶级，理所当然地也包括作为工人阶级一部分的知识分子。我们的科技工作者，要努力成为精通业务的专家，自觉坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，把自己的事业同社会主义现代化建设，同民族的命运、国家的前途紧密联系起来，肩负起自己的历史使命。我们要根据科学技术工作的特点，热情地关心科技人员的成长和进步，鼓励他们在科学技术实践中，掌握马列主义、毛泽东思想的认识论和方法论。要继续从优秀科技人员中发展党员，选拔干部。各级党政领导干部，要经常倾听科技工作者的建议、意见和呼声，认真解决他们学习、工作和生活中存在的实际问题，尊重他们，理解他们，爱护他们，做他们的知心朋友。
    同志们，党和政府重视科学技术事业，全国各族人民热切地期待科学技术进步，对全国科技工作者寄予厚望。我们相信，一切热爱祖国的科学家、专家、技术人员，一定会在党的基本路线指引下，为我国经济的繁荣，为社会的全面进步，为中华民族的振兴，为人民的共同幸福，做出新的越来越大的贡献！
