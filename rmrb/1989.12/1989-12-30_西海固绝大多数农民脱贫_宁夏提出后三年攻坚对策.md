Most farmers in Western Ningxia have shaken off poverty. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government have proposed new measures for the next three years.

Our reporter Huang Yiming reports from Yinchuan: As one of the poorest regions in the country, Western Ningxia has made significant progress in poverty alleviation over the past seven years since the reform and opening up. Now, 88% of the farmers have basically solved the problem of food and clothing. However, there are still three years left to achieve the national goal of poverty alleviation by 1992, and there are instances of "re-poverty" among the poverty-stricken households. The poverty alleviation work has entered the critical stage. What should be done next? On the eve of the New Year, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government proposed new poverty alleviation measures.

The guiding ideology and struggle goals of the new measures are to resolutely implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, continue to deepen rural reforms, focus on fighting the poverty alleviation battle and regional economic development, establish pillar industries, concentrate forces to implement one project (poverty alleviation project), and do a good job in three constructions (agricultural water conservancy, service system, and grassroots organizations). Develop four industries (starch, hemp, livestock products, and mining). Considering that the poverty-stricken mountainous areas of Western Ningxia account for 59% of the total area of the region and 45% of the population, and are also areas where the Hui people live and some are revolutionary old areas, the economic development of this region is directly related to the revitalization of Ningxia and social stability. The Party Committee and the Government of the region decided that the struggle goal for the next three years in the Western Ningxia region is: by 1990, reduce the poverty rate from 12% to 8%; then, after two years of consolidation and improvement, by 1992, strive to achieve per capita grain possession of 275-300 kilograms and per capita net income of 300 yuan for farmers, laying the foundation for complete poverty alleviation and prosperity.

To achieve the above poverty alleviation goals on time, the Party Committee and the Government of the region, based on the actual situation, proposed a series of poverty alleviation measures, the key points of which are:

	—— Take the places that have not yet shaken off poverty as the main battlefield for poverty alleviation. For the 31 townships and 427 villages that are the most impoverished, implement preferential policies, concentrate financial and material resources to solve major problems, and ensure that poverty alleviation reaches the households: planning targets reach the households; poverty alleviation projects reach the households; service measures reach the households; financial benefits reach the households; and poverty alleviation responsibilities reach the households.

	—— Strengthen agricultural infrastructure and improve production conditions. Continue to adhere to the construction policy of "water transportation where possible, and land transportation where water transportation is not available," prioritize grain production, concentrate investments to carry out large-scale agricultural infrastructure construction, and expand irrigated land by 130,000 mu and build 700,000 mu of basic farmland for dry farming within three years.

	—— Take planting, breeding, and processing as the main focus, and carry out comprehensive economic development. Guide farmers to change the single economic structure, combine planting, breeding, and family sideline production, combine long-term and short-term projects, focus on both grain and money, and take the path of mutual complementarity between grain and money.

	—— Gradually establish leading and pillar enterprises, form leading and pillar industries, and accelerate regional economic development according to the characteristics of the mountainous areas.

	—— Continue to strengthen the "hanging village" relocation work. Relocate people from poverty-stricken mountainous areas to the Yellow River irrigation area, providing a way out for those without a way out and accelerating the construction and development of the new Yellow River irrigation area. By 1992, on the basis of the 600,000 people who have already relocated, complete the relocation of 200,000 people, with more than 2/3 of the relocated people being poverty-stricken households.

	—— Strengthen scientific and technological services and accelerate poverty alleviation through science and technology. With scientific and technological development as the center, establish a technical service system for agriculture, animal husbandry, and other fields at all levels in poverty-stricken areas, and provide pre-production, in-production, and post-production services for farmers. Strengthen technical training and promote effective practical technological achievements.

	—— Combine family planning with poverty alleviation and strictly control population growth. To break the vicious cycle of "the poorer, the more children, the more children, the poorer," poverty alleviation must implement family planning targets to the households and individuals.

To ensure that poverty alleviation work is more detailed, solid, and effective in the future, the Party Committee and the Government of the region have designated Xiji County and Jingyuan County as poverty alleviation contact points, and assigned two responsible comrades to frequently contact and work hard.

    西海固绝大多数农民脱贫  宁夏提出后三年攻坚对策
    本报银川12月29日电　记者黄翊明报道：宁夏西海固作为全国最贫困的地区之一，改革开放以来，经过最近7年持续开展扶贫，已取得88％的农民基本解决温饱的可喜成绩。现在，离国家提出的1983—1992年第一个10年脱贫计划只有3年时间，脱贫户不时出现“返贫”现象。扶贫工作进入攻坚阶段，下一步怎么办？新年前夕，宁夏回族自治区党委和区人民政府提出了扶贫攻坚新对策。
    新对策的指导思想和奋斗目标是，坚决贯彻五中全会精神，继续深化农村改革，以打好温饱攻坚战和区域经济开发、建立支柱产业为重点，集中力量实施一个工程（温饱工程），搞好三项建设（农田水利、服务体系、基层组织），开发四个产业（淀粉、亚麻、土畜产、矿业）。考虑西海固贫困山区的面积占全区59％，人口占全区45％，又是回族聚居区，部分地区还是革命老区。这一地区的经济发展状况，直接关系着宁夏的振兴和社会稳定。区党委和区政府决定，今后3年西海固地区的奋斗目标是：到1990年，贫困面由12％缩小到8％；然后经过两年的巩固提高，到1992年力争达到人均占有粮食275—300公斤，农民人均纯收入300元，为今后全部脱贫致富奠定基础。
    为如期实现上述攻坚目标，区党委和区政府从实际出发，提出一系列扶贫措施，其要点是：
    ——把重点解决至今未脱贫地方作为扶贫攻坚主战场。对其中最贫困的31个乡、427个村实行倾斜政策，集中财力物力解决主要问题，并做到扶贫五到户：规划目标到户；扶贫项目到户；服务措施到户；资金效益到户；帮贫责任到户。
    ——加强农业基础建设，改善生产条件。继续坚持“能走水路走水路，水路不通走旱路”的建设方针，把粮食生产放在首位，集中投资大搞农业基础建设，3年内扩大水浇地13万亩，建设旱作基本农田70万亩。
    ——以种、养、加工为主，搞好综合经济开发。引导农民改变单一的经济结构，种植业、养殖业和家庭工副业结合，长效项目和短效项目结合，一手抓粮，一手抓钱，走钱粮互补的路子。
    ——进而建立龙头骨干企业，形成主导和支柱产业，根据山区特点，加快区域经济开发。
    ——继续加强“吊庄”移民工作。从贫困山区移民到引黄灌区，既为没有出路的贫困户找到出路，又加快了引黄新灌区的建设开发。到1992年，在现已搬迁6万人的基础上，完成搬迁20万人的任务，贫困户占搬迁户的2／3以上。
    ——抓好科技服务，依靠科技加快脱贫步伐。以科技开发为中心，把贫困地区各级农技、畜牧等技术服务体系建立起来，为农民提供产前、产中和产后服务。加强技术培训，推广行之有效的实用技术成果。
    ——计划生育与扶贫结合，严格控制人口增长。为摆脱“越穷越生，越生越穷”的恶性循环，扶贫必须将生育指标落实到户到人。
    为保证扶贫工作今后做得更细致、更扎实、更有成效，区党委、区政府已将西吉县和泾源县作为扶贫工作联系点，确定两位负责同志经常联系，真抓实干。
