The spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Kampuchea United Government issued a statement on December 11, strongly opposing leaving the seat of Democratic Kampuchea in the United Nations vacant.

The statement broadcasted by the Democratic Kampuchea radio yesterday said that recently, the Phnom Penh regime backed by Vietnam claimed that as long as the seat of Democratic Kampuchea in the United Nations is left vacant, it would agree to hold elections under United Nations supervision.

The statement pointed out, "Leaving the seat of Democratic Kampuchea in the United Nations vacant is actually to legalize the Vietnamese puppet regime in Phnom Penh. Vietnam intends to use this 'legalized' regime as a cover to continue controlling and occupying Cambodia. As long as this puppet regime exists, the Vietnamese invaders can hide in Cambodia."

The statement called on Vietnam to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia under international supervision, dissolve the illegal Phnom Penh regime and the legitimate Democratic Kampuchea United Government, achieve genuine national reconciliation, and establish a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk. The statement said that elections under Vietnamese control are completely deceptive.

    民柬外交部发言人发表声明
    坚决反对空缺民柬在联合国席位
    新华社北京12月13日电　民主柬埔寨联合政府外交部发言人12月11日发表声明，坚决反对空缺民主柬埔寨在联合国的席位。
    民主柬埔寨电台昨天广播的这项声明说，最近，越南扶植的金边政权宣称，只要空缺民柬在联合国的席位，它将同意在联合国监督下举行大选。
    声明指出，“空缺”民柬在联合国的席位，实际上就是使越南的金边傀儡政权合法化。越南企图在这个“合法化”的政权的幌子下继续控制和霸占柬埔寨。只要这个傀儡政权存在，越南侵略者就可能在柬埔寨隐藏下来。
    声明呼吁越南在国际监督下从柬埔寨全部撤军，解散非法的金边政权和合法的民主柬埔寨联合政府，实现真正的民族和解，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，在联合国组织监督下举行大选。声明说，在越南控制下的大选是完全骗人的。
