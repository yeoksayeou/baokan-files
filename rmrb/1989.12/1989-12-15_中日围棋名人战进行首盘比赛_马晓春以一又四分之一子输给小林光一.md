Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th.

The first match of the second China-Japan Go Championship was held today. Despite a fierce struggle, Chinese player Ma Xiaochun, 9th dan, lost to Japan's Kobayashi Koichi, 9th dan, by one and a quarter points. This was the first match of the series.

After a coin toss, Ma Xiaochun chose to play black. Ma is known for his ability to play either black or white, but he preferred black against the formidable Kobayashi.

The morning session surprised many. Instead of the usual cautious and meticulous opening moves seen in major tournaments, both players moved swiftly, creating a dynamic and fluid game. By noon, when the session ended, they had completed 102 moves. Experts were astonished, as such a rapid pace was unprecedented in a high-stakes match between China and Japan.

Chinese Go experts watching the game in the analysis room felt the situation was unclear, but Ma seemed to be slightly disadvantaged. Some experts questioned Ma's 101st move.

In the afternoon, both players fought to secure territory. Kobayashi's advantage was gradually eroded by Ma's tenacious counterattacks, but Ma ultimately could not reverse the tide. Nie Weiping, 9th dan, commented that both players had opportunities to slow down the game, but Kobayashi's superior strength gave him the edge.

The match lasted 274 moves. Ma used 2 hours and 57 minutes, while Kobayashi used 2 hours and 55 minutes.

In the afternoon, Wang Qun, 8th dan, and Wu Yulin, 6th dan, of the national Go team, gave a live commentary to over 100 Go enthusiasts at the China-Japan Go Friendship Hall. Senior officials Zhang Jingfu and Jin Ming also attended the live commentary session.

The second match of the China-Japan Go Championship will be held on the 16th. Ma Xiaochun will play white, making for an even more challenging battle.

    中日围棋名人战进行首盘比赛
    马晓春以一又四分之一子输给小林光一
    本报北京12月14日讯　记者陈昭报道：中国棋手马晓春九段今天尽管顽强奋战，拚到最后一刻，但仍然以一又四分之一子输给了日本的小林光一九段，这是第二届中日围棋名人战的首盘比赛。
    经过猜先，马晓春执黑子先行，本来马晓春在国内棋手中，素有黑白子均无所谓的名声，但用他自己的话来讲，对付小林光一这样强大的对手，他当然愿意用黑子。
    上午的比赛大大出乎人们的预料，双方一落座，便一反往日在重大比赛中小心翼翼、如履薄冰、谨慎用兵布阵的惯常下法，只见两位棋手下子飞速，确有“大珠小珠溅玉盘”之势，至中午12时封盘止，双方共下了一百零二手。行家们十分惊诧，在中日两国棋界如此重大的比赛中，一个上午就走了一百余手，这还是从未有过的。
    在研究室观战的中国棋界高手们，认为上午的形势并不明朗，但马晓春似乎稍处下风，一些专家对他的一百零一手提出疑问。
    下午战局重开，双方均拚命捞取实地，小林光一的优势在马晓春的顽强反击下尽管一点点被侵削，但马晓春最后仍然没有挽回败势。聂卫平九段在评论这盘棋时说，双方都有缓着之处，但由于小林光一实力更强一些，自然占了上风。
    这盘棋共下了二百七十四手，马晓春用时两小时五十七分，小林光一用时两小时五十五分。
    今天下午，国家围棋队王群八段和吴玉林六段在中日围棋友好会馆挂大盘给100多位棋迷们进行现场讲棋，张劲夫、金明等老同志也特地赶来听了现场讲棋。
    中日围棋名人战的第二盘比赛十六日将继续进行，届时，马晓春将执白子，这对他来讲无疑是一场更为艰巨的战斗。
