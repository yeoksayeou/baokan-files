Feudal superstition is prohibited by Chinese law, but currently, such activities have resurfaced and have become a serious social problem that is cause for concern. The prominent features of this wave of ignorance are:

First, it has spread from rural areas to small and medium-sized cities, and from being covert to becoming overt. In many urban areas, you can see superstition practitioners on street corners, alleys, and stations, offering services such as fortune-telling, divination, exorcism, and palmistry. Some cities even have "fortune-telling streets," forming organized groups of superstition practitioners.

Second, the participants in feudal superstition activities are becoming younger. In the past, those involved in such activities were mostly elderly people. Now, a significant number of young and middle-aged people, including some government officials, Communist Party members, and university students, are engaging in superstition. These activities now permeate various aspects of people's daily production and life.

Third, feudal superstition activities are intertwined with the destructive activities of a few hostile elements and serious criminal offenders. In some places, certain feudal religious organizations, in order to protect their own interests, have attempted to seize control of local self-governing organizations, resist government authority, shield criminals, and disrupt legal proceedings. Some even harass judicial organs, and in extreme cases, gather crowds to attack public security agencies and demand the release of criminals. Some use this opportunity to spread counter-revolutionary rumors, incite the masses to oppose the Communist Party, and oppose the socialist system, attempting to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship.

    当前封建迷信活动的特点
    封建迷信是我国的法律所禁止的，但是目前这种活动又死灰复燃，已经成为令人忧虑的严重的社会问题。这股愚昧风突出的特点：
    一是由农村扩展到中小城市，由隐蔽转向公开。许多城镇的街头巷尾、车站，随处可见迷信职业者进行算命、测字、祛邪画符，以及看手相、相面等。有的城市还出现了“算命一条街”，形成了迷信职业者的“行业组织”。
    二是群众性的封建迷信活动趋向年轻化。过去搞封建迷信活动，多是老年人，而现在有相当数量的中青年人，甚至有的机关干部、共产党员、大学生也搞起迷信来。并且涉及人们日常生产、生活各方面。
    三是封建迷信活动同少数敌对分子、严重刑事犯罪分子的破坏活动交织在一起。如有的地方一些封建宗教组织为了维护本族利益篡夺基层群众性自治组织的领导权，对抗政府，包庇罪犯，有的不服法律制裁，骚扰司法机关，甚至聚众冲砸公安机关，索抢罪犯。有的借机制造反革命谣言，煽动群众反对共产党，反对社会主义制度，妄图颠覆人民民主专政。
