A senior official of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection recently spoke to our reporter, saying that the good momentum in the fight against corruption has been hard-won, and we must be vigilant against the resurgence of the bad practice of using public funds for banquets and gifts at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year.

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, various levels of party committees implemented the four tasks proposed by the Central Committee, overcame the situation of being "tough on one hand and soft on the other," and paid attention to strengthening party building. They placed the work of punishing corruption on an important agenda. The Central Committee and the State Council promptly made a decision on doing a few things that the people care about in the near future, determined to start from the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the State Council, and lead by example in being honest and upright, working hard, and punishing corruption, which had good results and set an example for the whole party. Many regions and departments have made regulations against corruption and maintaining honesty, starting from the leading cadres, leading one level after another, implementing and promoting honesty, and beginning to create a good atmosphere of preventing corruption and maintaining honesty. The use of public funds for banquets and gifts, eating and entertaining has decreased compared to before, and the phenomenon of eating at every meeting and entertaining every guest has begun to subside. However, the task of punishing corruption is still quite arduous. As for using public funds for banquets and gifts, some places, departments, and units are still very serious.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection believes that while we should fully affirm the good momentum that has begun to appear in the fight against corruption, we should not overestimate it. We must persist and insist on carrying it out unremittingly. In particular, the bad practice of using public funds for banquets and gifts is prone to recurrence during the New Year and Spring Festival, and we must not let our guard down. Now that the New Year and Spring Festival are approaching, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection requires all levels of party organizations and all party members and cadres to understand the big picture and consider the overall situation, take active and effective measures, and resolutely curb the bad practice of using public funds for banquets and gifts, and consolidate and develop the good momentum that has begun to appear in the fight against corruption with practical actions. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection proposes:

1. Continue to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the 13th Central Committee, deeply understand the extreme importance of punishing corruption in strengthening the relationship between the party and the people, enhancing the party's cohesion and combat effectiveness, and strengthening the party's leadership over the cause of socialist modernization, as well as the great significance of the Central Committee's proposal to carry forward the spirit of hard work and tighten our belts for a few years in the face of temporary economic difficulties, in order to achieve the further rectification and deepening of reform. Raise the awareness of all party members to prevent corruption and maintain honesty, and oppose the use of public funds for banquets and gifts, extravagance, and waste.

2. Higher-level organs and units should promptly remind lower-level organs and units, resolutely implement the regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council, and not use any excuse or method to send gifts upward or entertain guests; higher-level organs should not instruct lower-level organs to give gifts. Strictly implement financial discipline, do not issue money and goods indiscriminately, and do not use public funds for the New Year. Otherwise, the main responsible persons of the relevant organs and units will be strictly held accountable.

3. All levels of party organizations and discipline inspection organs should strengthen the supervision and inspection of the implementation of the Central Committee and the State Council's regulations on "strictly prohibiting banquets and gifts." If problems are found, they should be corrected in a timely manner. For those who persist in violating the regulations and have serious circumstances, they should be severely punished.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection hopes that all levels of party and government organs, all Communist Party members, especially party member leaders, will take the lead in implementing the regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council, and spend a thrifty and meaningful New Year and Spring Festival with a clean and upright spirit.

    中纪委负责人年终向本报记者发表谈话
    发展反腐败斗争好形势
    警惕请客送礼歪风抬头
    本报讯　记者郑红深报道：中共中央纪委负责同志日前对本报记者发表谈话说，反腐败斗争开始出现的好形势来之不易，要警惕在年终岁首公费请客送礼之歪风再度抬头。
    党的十三届四中全会后，各级党委贯彻落实中央提出的四项任务，克服“一手硬、一手软”的状况，重视加强党的建设，把惩治腐败的工作摆到了重要日程。中共中央、国务院及时作出了关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定，下决心从党中央、国务院领导同志做起，带头廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗，惩治腐败，收到好的效果，为全党树立了榜样。不少地区和部门作出了反对腐败、保持廉洁的规定，从领导干部做起，一级带一级，抓落实，促廉洁，开始出现了一个防腐保廉的好气候。用公费请客送礼、吃喝招待的比以前减少了，过去那种逢会必吃、逢客必请的现象开始收敛。但是，惩治腐败的任务还相当艰巨。就公费请客送礼而言，有的地方、部门和单位仍很严重。
    中央纪委认为，对目前反腐败斗争开始出现的好形势既要充分肯定，但又不能估计过高。必须坚持不懈持之以恒地抓下去。特别是用公费请客送礼这一歪风，每逢过年过节极易反复，对此更不能放松警惕。现在正值元旦春节即将来临之际，中央纪委要求各级党组织和全体党员干部要识大体、顾大局，采取积极有效的措施，坚决刹住公费请客送礼的歪风，以实际行动巩固和发展目前反腐败斗争开始出现的好形势。中央纪委提出：
    一、要继续认真地学习贯彻好党的十三届四中全会和五中全会的精神，深刻理解惩治腐败对于密切党群关系，增强党的凝聚力、战斗力和强化党对社会主义现代化事业领导的极端重要性，以及在我国经济面临暂时困难的情况下，中央提出发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，过几年紧日子，对于实现进一步治理整顿和深化改革方针的重大意义。提高全体党员防腐保廉，反对公费请客送礼、铺张浪费的自觉性。
    二、上级机关和单位要及时给下级机关和单位打招呼，坚决执行党中央、国务院的规定，不得以任何借口、任何方式向上送礼，请吃请喝；上级更不得向下级授意索要；严格执行财经纪律，不准滥发钱物，公费过年。否则，要严格追究有关机关和单位主要负责人的责任。
    三、各级党组织和纪检机关要加强对党中央、国务院“严格禁止请客送礼”规定执行情况的监督检查，发现问题，及时纠正。对有禁不止、执意违反、情节恶劣的，要加重给予处理。
    中央纪委希望各级党政机关、全体共产党员，特别是党员领导干部，要带头执行党中央、国务院的规定，以清正廉洁的精神过一个俭朴的、有意义的元旦和春节。
