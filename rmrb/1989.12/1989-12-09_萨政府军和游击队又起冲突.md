Salvadoran government forces and guerrillas clashed in several areas early on Saturday.

The fiercest fighting took place in the northern part of the capital, San Salvador, where the guerrillas fired about sixty mortar shells at the government military headquarters. The guerrillas claimed that the attack resulted in forty-five casualties among government forces. Military officials, however, denied that any shells had fallen near the headquarters.

Government forces and guerrillas also exchanged fire in the wealthy southwestern district of the capital, where the U.S. embassy and the Presidential Hotel are located. According to a military spokesman, the guerrillas fired mortar shells at the "residential area." Due to government military aircraft and helicopters hovering over the northern part of the capital and firing flares at guerrilla assembly points, some areas of San Salvador were illuminated as if it were daytime for several hours.

In addition to the capital, San Salvador, government forces and guerrillas also clashed in Chalatenango, El Tránsito, San Miguel, and other locations. The guerrillas also destroyed some high-voltage power poles and attacked several estates.

    萨政府军和游击队又起冲突
    七日凌晨，萨尔瓦多游击队在首都圣萨尔瓦多和内地至少五个地区与政府军发生激烈交战。
    交战最激烈的地方发生在圣萨尔瓦多北部地区，游击队向政府军参谋总部大楼发射了约六十枚迫击炮弹。据游击队方面说，在这次袭击中，政府军伤亡人数达四十五人。军方人士却声称在参谋总部周围没有落下任何炮弹。
    政府军和游击队还在美国大使馆、总统饭店所在的首都西南部富人区交火。据军方发言人说，游击队向该地区的“居民区”发射了迫击炮弹。由于政府军的军用飞机和直升机在首都北部地区上空盘旋，并向游击队集结点发射照明弹，圣萨尔瓦多一些地区有好几小时照耀得如同白昼。
    除首都圣萨尔瓦多外，游击队和政府军还在查拉特南弋、埃尔特兰西托、圣米格尔等地发生军事冲突。游击队还破坏了一些高压电杆，并袭击了一些庄园。
