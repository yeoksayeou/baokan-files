The market, in a situation where total demand exceeds total supply but sales are sluggish, is about to enter the traditional peak season. Commerce departments must seize this opportunity to focus on ensuring a good supply for the New Year and Spring Festival, and to launch a wave of expanded sales, allowing urban and rural residents to celebrate the two festivals happily.

This is what Zhang Shiyao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce, said in a recent interview with a reporter.

Zhang Shiyao believes that the current sluggish sales phenomenon is localized—mainly in some industrial products, foodstuffs, and agricultural and sideline specialty products—and is structural in nature. It is also temporary—some products that are currently sluggish may become stable or even tight next year. It is also superficial—because from an overall perspective, the situation where total demand exceeds total supply has not fundamentally changed. The main contradiction in the market is still the insufficient effective supply, especially for key commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, and for marketable products that are in short supply.

Zhang Shiyao recently conducted some investigations at the grassroots level and found that amid the widespread talk of market sluggishness, wholesale and retail commerce at the grassroots level, as well as grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, often face issues of incomplete product varieties and weak inventory. Data provided by the Planning and Regulation Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce also confirms this. As of the end of October, the Ministry of Commerce's statistics on the inventory levels of 58 major commodities showed that 35 of them had lower inventory levels than the same period last year. Among the 36 industrial products reported by rural supply and marketing cooperatives, 26 had decreased inventory levels. The total inventory value of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives increased by only 5.8%, and after excluding the price factor, the inventory was clearly reduced.

Zhang Shiyao analyzed that the above situation is due to both capital shortages and high bank interest rates, as well as the issue of grassroots commercial enterprises being risk-averse, waiting and observing, and not actively purchasing goods. He said that the market potential in both urban and rural areas in China is enormous, especially in the vast rural market. Currently, the supply volume and variety of many products have not yet met the needs of farmers.

Zhang Shiyao said that the upcoming New Year and Spring Festival is a great opportunity for commercial enterprises to expand sales, activate the market, and adjust inventory structure. All levels of commerce departments and enterprises across the country must take immediate action, boost morale, and work together to push the various promotional activities that have already begun to a new high. He said that the Ministry of Commerce has proposed eight requirements for this purpose:

1. Change the mindset and work style;
2. Do everything possible to increase the supply of industrial products to rural areas;
3. Collaborate between industry and commerce, and between commerce and agriculture;
4. Solve funding difficulties;
5. Conduct a comprehensive inventory check;
6. Organize seasonal sales competitions tailored to local conditions;
7. Facilitate the circulation of goods, and firmly oppose regional and urban-rural blockades;
8. Mobilize the enthusiasm of purchasing and sales personnel, solve their practical living difficulties as much as possible, and correctly handle the relationship between carrying out normal business activities and strengthening anti-corruption efforts.

Zhang Shiyao revealed that after multiple analyses of the market situation, the Ministry of Commerce proposed that the market sluggishness will continue for some time, but the overall trend for next year's market is stable with signs of prosperity and tightness. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce's policy remains to "grasp two key tasks": one is to stabilize the market and ensure the supply of daily necessities for the people; the other is to activate the market, promote sales to stimulate purchases and production.

    商业部要求各级商业部门早作准备
    掀起旺季销售高潮  活跃元旦春节市场
    据新华社北京12月1日电  （记者陈芸）市场，在总需求大于总供给同时又出现销售疲软的矛盾中，即将进入传统的大旺季节。商业部门要抓住这一有利时机，以搞好元旦、春节供应为中心，掀起一个扩大销售的高潮，让城乡人民高高兴兴过好两个节日。
    这是商业部副部长张世尧日前接受记者采访时说的一番话。
    张世尧认为，目前市场销售疲软现象是局部的——主要表现在一部分工业品、副食品和农副土特产品上，是一种结构性的疲软；也是暂时的——一些现在疲软的商品，明年有可能转为稳中偏紧；又是表面的——因为从总体上讲，总需求大于总供给的格局没有根本改变，市场上的主要矛盾还是有效供给不足，特别是一些关系国计民生的主要商品和适销对路的商品偏紧。
    张世尧最近到基层作了一些调查，他发现，在一片市场疲软声中，基层批发、零售商业，以及基层供销社商品品种不全、库存薄弱的情况却相当普遍。商业部规划调节司提供的资料也证实了这一点。10月末商业部统计的58种主要商品的库存量，有35种少于去年同期；其中农村供销社统计的36种工业品，有26种库存下降。基层供销社商品库存总值仅增长5.8％，扣除物价因素，库存是明显减少的。
    张世尧分析说，上述状况既有资金短缺、银行利息高的原因，也有基层商业企业怕担风险，“买涨不买落”，等待观望，不积极进货的问题。他说，我国城乡市场的潜力都是很大的，尤其是广大农村市场，现在相当一部分商品的供应量和花色品种，远远没有满足农民的需要。
    张世尧说，即将来临的元旦、春节，是商业企业扩大销售，活跃市场，调整库存结构的大好时机，全国各级商业部门和企业必须立即行动起来，振奋精神，齐心协力，把最近以来已经开始的各种推销活动推向一个新高潮。他说，商业部为此提出八项要求：
    一是转变思想，转变作风；二是千方百计扩大工业品下乡；三是工商、农商联合；四是解决资金困难；五是普遍开展一次清仓查库；六是因地制宜，开展旺季销售的竞赛活动；七是疏通搞活商品流通渠道，坚决反对地区之间、城乡之间互相封锁；八是调动购销人员积极性，尽量解决他们生活上的实际困难，正确处理开展正常业务活动与加强廉政建设的关系。
    张世尧透露，商业部最近对市场形势进行多次分析后提出，市场疲软仍将继续一段时间，但明年市场总的趋势是稳中有旺，稳中偏紧。因此商业部的方针仍然是坚持“两手抓”，一手抓稳定市场，保证人民生活必需品的供应；一手抓搞活市场，以销促购，以销促产。
