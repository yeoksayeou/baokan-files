The level of geophysical exploration equipment directly affects the precision and speed of geophysical exploration. In recent years, the petroleum geophysical exploration equipment manufacturing industry has been digesting and absorbing imported technologies. People have seen—hope is rising here.

Reporter Lù Háng of this newspaper was invited by colleagues from the Geophysical Exploration Bureau of the China National Petroleum Corporation to visit their equipment manufacturing industry. They said: "There, you can see the hope of achieving domestic production of geophysical exploration equipment..."

Do not underestimate the geophysical exploration equipment manufacturing industry. Geophysical exploration is the first step in finding oil, and its precision and speed directly determine the subsequent exploration and development benefits of the mining area. "To do a job well, one must first sharpen one's tools." The relationship between geophysical exploration equipment and the precision and speed of geophysical exploration is obvious. In the eyes of experts, the manufacturing technology of geophysical exploration equipment is on par with the manufacturing technology of aerospace and defense equipment. China's first billion-bit computer, the Galaxy system, is installed at the Geophysical Exploration Bureau. To achieve the modernization of geophysical exploration, from 1980 to 1985, China imported $700 million worth of geophysical exploration equipment.

Undoubtedly, for any country living in the international environment, importation is inevitable and necessary. However, is it importation—digestion—innovation—catching up with the advanced, or is it importation—use—re-import? The employees of the Geophysical Exploration Bureau's equipment manufacturing industry chose the former.

		Turning "Soft Constraints" into "Hard Indicators"

A project from technological importation to digestion and absorption for domestic production takes at least three to five years, and at most seven to eight years. Wang Jiǎnrén, the deputy director of the Geophysical Exploration Bureau in charge of equipment manufacturing, advocates changing the single short-term economic benefit evaluation index for enterprises' technological importation by the state to a comprehensive evaluation index that includes short-term economic benefits, long-term economic benefits, equipment utilization rate, and capital occupation rate. In this way, people unify high-level technological importation with domestic production, and for every technological importation, they simultaneously formulate a domestic production plan and schedule for batch production; in terms of capital allocation, they consider both importation, production, and full production, as well as digestion, absorption, and innovation. The effect of turning "soft constraints" into "hard indicators" is obvious. The Instrument Factory of the Geophysical Exploration Bureau implements the policy of simultaneously advancing the importation of foreign technology and the domestic production of raw materials. After two years of hard work, the import of raw materials for the production of geophones has been reduced from 100% to 30%, and the product quality is excellent.

		"After 'Taking In'"

After "taking in," they learn from the best and develop new products. The employees of the Mechanical Factory of the Geophysical Exploration Bureau did it this way. The workers clearly proposed: "First, learn the strengths of the foreign drilling rigs, and second, overcome their weaknesses." To improve the performance of the mud pump on the drilling rig, they held 20 discussion meetings and implemented 64 experimental plans. Now, their produced series of vehicle-mounted drilling rigs have reached the international advanced level, and they have repeatedly won bids against similar factories in the United States, West Germany, and Canada.

There are many such examples like the Mechanical Factory. According to statistics, from 1983 to 1988, the Geophysical Exploration Bureau's equipment manufacturing industry developed 9 categories and more than 50 new products in the process of dealing with advanced technologies and equipment from abroad; with an investment of 67 million yuan, they created 69 million yuan in taxes and profits for the state.

		The "Grafting" Technique

The Geophysical Exploration Bureau's equipment manufacturing industry has only 2,800 employees, with fixed assets of over 91 million yuan, but this year's output value is over 120 million yuan. An important reason for the high efficiency is that they do not take the "big and complete" or "small and complete" path with high input and slow results, but insist on selecting mature universal components in society, manufacturing some special components themselves, and adding a few imported components that are not yet up to standard domestically to form highly specialized geophysical exploration equipment. In short, they use universal equipment to "graft" specialized technology.

The director of the Special Vehicle Manufacturing Factory of the Geophysical Exploration Bureau, Jiá Jùnqí, pointed to the 5-ton desert vehicle they produced and said to the reporter: "In the desert, you can't do without this thing when exploring and developing petroleum and natural gas! Two years ago, we still had to import the whole machine, costing more than $50,000 per unit. Today, we only need to import a component called the drive steering knuckle for a few hundred dollars, and we can produce a high-quality desert vehicle ourselves. This saves the country a lot of precious foreign exchange! Why can we produce China's desert vehicle in just two years? You see, the engine, transmission, front and rear axles are produced by factories in Beijing, Hubei, and Jiangsu, respectively, and only the beam, transfer case, and driver's cab are special components produced by our factory. If we were to manufacture everything ourselves, it would take us many years and a lot of fixed assets to produce a desert vehicle!"

    物探装备水平的高低直接关系着物探精度和速度，近些年来，石油物探装备制造业消化吸收引进技术，人们看到——
    希望在这里升起
    本报记者　鹿舫
    中国石油天然气总公司地球物理勘探局的同志邀记者去采访他们的装备制造业，说：在那里你可以看到实现物探装备国产化的希望……
    可别小视物探装备制造业。物探是找油的第一道工序，它的精度和速度直接决定矿区日后的勘探开发效益。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。物探装备同物探精度和速度之间的关系是显而易见的。在行家的眼中，物探装备的制造技术是与航天、国防设备的制造技术排在同一个档次的。我国第一台亿次计算机——银河系统就安装在石油物探局。为了实现物探现代化，1980—1985年这6年间，我国就引进了7亿美元的物探装备。
    毫无疑问，引进对于每一个生活在国际大环境中的国家来说，都是不可避免的，也是必需的。然而，是引进——消化——创新——赶上先进呢？还是引进——使用——再引进呢？物探局装备制造业的职工选择了前者。
                变“软约束”为“硬指标”
    一个项目从技术引进到消化吸收为国产化产品，少则三五年，多则七八年。物探局分管装备制造工作的王见仁副局长，主张把国家对企业技术引进的单一近期经济效益考核指标，改为近期经济效益、远期经济效益、技术设备利用率和资金占用率等综合考核指标。这样一来，人们把高起点引进技术与立足于国产化统一起来，每引进一项技术，就同时制定出国产化计划，排出形成批量生产的时间表；在资金安排上，既考虑引进、投产、达产，又考虑消化、吸收、创新。这种变“软约束”为“硬指标”的效果很明显。物探局仪器厂实行国外技术的引进与原辅料国产化齐头并进的方针，两年奋战，使制作检波器原材料进口由100％减少到30％，而且产品质量优良。
                        “拿来”以后
      “拿来”以后，博采众长，开发新产品。物探局机械厂的同志是这样做的。职工们明确提出：“一要把洋钻机的长处学过来，二要把洋钻机的短处克服掉。”为改进那钻机上泥浆泵的性能，他们开了20次讨论会，先后实施过64个试验方案。如今，他们生产的车装钻机系列已经达到国际先进水平，在同美国、联邦德国、加拿大的同类厂家一起投标时，一再中标。
    像机械厂这样的事例是很多的。据统计，1983年至1988年，物探局装备制造业在同国外先进技术和先进设备打交道的过程中，先后研制出了9大类50余种新产品；用6700万元的投入，为国家创造出了6900万元的利税。
              “嫁接”的学问
    物探局装备制造业一共只有2800名职工，现有固定资产9100多万元，而今年的产值却有1.2亿多元。产生高效益的一个重要原因是，他们不走那种投入多、见效慢的“大而全”、
  “小而全”的路，而坚持选用社会上成熟的通用部件，自制一些专用部件，再加上个别国内尚不过关的进口部件，来构成专业性极强的物探装备。简言之，用通用设备“嫁接”专用技术。
    物探局特种车辆制造厂厂长贾俊琦指着他们生产的5吨级的沙漠车对记者说：在戈壁沙漠上勘探开发石油天然气，可离不开这家伙哩！两年以前，我们还得进口整机，一台要花5万多美元。今天，我们只要花几百美元进口一个名叫驱动转向节的部件，自己就可以高质量地造出一台。这为国家节省了多少宝贵的外汇呀！为啥我们两年就能造出中国的沙漠车？您看，这发动机、变速箱、前后桥分别是北京、湖北、江苏厂家生产的通用件，只有这大梁、分动箱、驾驶室是本厂生产的专用件。要是什么都由我们自己来制造，那不知要花多少年，要用多少固定资产，才能造出沙漠车哪！
