Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th.

Vice Chairman of the National Hygiene Committee and Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said this afternoon at the national rural water improvement work telephone conference: The drinking water issue for 570 million farmers in our country has been initially improved, with nearly 200 million farmers now having access to tap water. This has effectively controlled and reduced the spread and prevalence of intestinal infectious diseases and endemic diseases. For a country with 860 million rural residents, this is a remarkable achievement.

In April 1986, the Sixth National People's Congress, Fourth Session, included the rural water improvement project in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development," stipulating: "By 1990, strive to ensure that 80% of the rural population has access to safe and hygienic drinking water." Chen Minzhang said, we need to complete the water improvement task for another 110 million rural residents by 1990. This is a formidable task. We hope to receive full understanding and support from all relevant departments.

    改善农村饮水条件还需作出很大努力
    本报北京12月5日讯　全国爱卫会副主任、卫生部部长陈敏章今天下午在全国农村改水工作电话会议上指出：我国有5.7亿农民的饮水问题初步得到改善，近2亿农民吃上了自来水，有效地控制和减少了肠道传染病及地方病的传播和流行。这对于一个有着8.6亿农村人口的大国来说，是件了不起的事情。
    1986年4月，全国人大六届四次会议把农村改水事业纳入了《国民经济和社会发展第七个五年计划》，规定：“1990年争取使80％的农村人口饮用安全卫生水。”陈敏章说，我们要在1990年里再完成1.1亿农村人口的改水任务，这是一项艰巨的任务。希望得到各有关部门充分理解和支持。（郑幼德）
