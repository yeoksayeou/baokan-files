The famous Baise Uprising in the history of the Chinese revolution has been 60 years since it occurred. On December 11, 1929, and February 1, 1930, Deng Xiaoping, along with Zhang Yunyi, Wei Bagu, Li Mingrui, and others, launched and led the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings in Guangxi, establishing the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army, and opening up the Left and Right River revolutionary base areas. This arduous revolutionary struggle joined the historical creative activities of Chinese communists, led by Mao Zedong, in exploring the path of the Chinese revolution. It added new vitality and color to the "armed struggle of workers and peasants" that was spreading across the country, providing valuable experience for consolidating and developing rural base areas. It has become an important asset in the history of the Chinese revolution.

I

The successful launch of the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings fully demonstrated the Marxist thought and revolutionary courage of Deng Xiaoping and others in adhering to the principle of seeking truth from facts and making realistic choices for the revolutionary path. After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, our party independently led armed struggles and successively established a number of rural base areas. However, from 1928 to 1929, due to the "encirclement and suppression" by local warlords and the influence of the "leftist adventurist" policies within the party, most of the established revolutionary base areas suffered severe damage or even failure. In this situation, some within the party became pessimistic and doubted whether the path of armed struggle of workers and peasants and the establishment of rural base areas could continue. After the outbreak of the Guangxi-Guangdong War in 1929, the situation began to change. The Red Fourth Army, led by Zhu De and Mao Zedong, left Jinggangshan and, with the cooperation of local party organizations, opened up the revolutionary base areas in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian. They also held the famous Gutian Conference in December of that year. The armed struggles in the Xianghuai, E'cheng-Hubei-Anhui, Jiangdongbei, and Xianghuai areas also overcame initial severe difficulties and began to develop. However, there were still serious disagreements within the party on the fundamental issue of which path the Chinese revolution should take. The Baise and Longzhou Uprisings were planned and launched under such a complex and severe situation.

Whether the uprising should be based on large and medium-sized cities or rural areas was a fundamental issue that determined the fate of the uprising. Deng Xiaoping and others made the correct decision based on the actual situation. In late September 1929, Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui, who had just taken control of the military and political power in Guangxi, were incited by the Nationalist Party's reorganization faction to hastily decide to send troops to fight against Chiang Kai-shek. Although our party tried to dissuade them, Yu and Li remained determined. This forced the 3,000-strong armed forces under our party's control in Nanning to make a choice. At that time, various opinions emerged within the party in Guangxi. Some suggested following Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui to attack Chen Jitang; others proposed moving the troops to Wuzhou and Guiping; still, others advocated immediately launching an uprising in Nanning. At this critical moment, Deng Xiaoping decisively decided to move the 3,000-strong troops to the Left and Right River areas, where there was a considerable mass base but weak enemy forces, to join forces with Wei Bagu and others who led the peasant army there, launch the uprising, and establish a revolutionary base area. This decision, which was in line with the actual situation, ensured the success of the uprising.

The victory of the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings, the birth of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army, and the establishment of the Left and Right River base areas hold an important position in the early armed struggles and rural base area construction led by our party. These two uprisings opened up revolutionary base areas in more than 20 counties, covering an area of about 50,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1 million in the Left and Right River and Red Water River basins in the southwestern border of Guangxi. At their peak, the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army had nearly 10,000 troops. Many Zhuang, Yao, and other ethnic minorities took up arms and fought bravely under the leadership of our party. The significance of the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings lies not only in spreading the revolutionary flames of land revolution, armed struggle, and the establishment of rural base areas to the Left and Right River areas, cultivating and accumulating a large number of party cadres and armed forces, mobilizing tens of thousands of people to join the revolution, and striking a heavy blow to the local reactionary warlords and landlords. More importantly, it strongly supported the armed struggles of workers and peasants across the country that were developing in a tortuous manner. It also proved in practice that the armed struggle of the Chinese revolution must shift from cities to rural areas where enemy control is weak, establish solid rural base areas, and follow the path of surrounding cities from the countryside.

II

Adhering to seeking truth from facts, especially preventing various one-sidedness. A common problem is that when correcting one-sidedness, it often swings to another extreme. After the failure of the first Great Revolution, some comrades within the party made such an error in dealing with the united front issue: from relying entirely on the united front, giving up initiative and leadership, to doubting or even not mentioning the united front. In the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings, Deng Xiaoping's spirit of insisting on the correct united front policy and seeking truth from facts, despite pressure, still gives us profound enlightenment today. At that time, correctly summarizing the experience and lessons of the united front and doing a good job in united front work in actual struggles was an important task facing the party's cause. In the creation and development of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army, this was also a crucial issue. It can even be said that without adhering to the correct united front policy and conducting effective united front work, it would have been impossible to successfully launch the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings, and there would have been no Red Seventh Army and Red Eighth Army.

In July 1929, after Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui took control of Guangxi, they requested our party to send some cadres to help with the work to consolidate their foothold in Guangxi. Our party decided to use this opportunity to develop revolutionary forces. Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi, along with more than 40 other party cadres, came to Guangxi at this time. At that time, Deng Xiaoping, as the representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was fully responsible for leading the revolutionary work in Guangxi. He used the name Deng Bin and successively held important positions such as the secretary of the Guangxi Front Committee of the Communist Party of China and the political commissar of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army. The first complex problem Deng Xiaoping encountered after arriving in Nanning was how to use the united front policy to handle the relationship with Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui in actual work, thereby expanding and accumulating revolutionary forces. In this regard, Deng Xiaoping's superb leadership art and policy strategy level were fully demonstrated, and his courage to resist wrong opinions and his principle of seeking truth from facts and not following the crowd were also fully displayed.

In handling the relationship with Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui, Deng Xiaoping saw both their progressive tendencies and their contradictions with the Guangxi warlords, as well as their limitations at that time. Therefore, on the one hand, he actively cooperated with Yu and Li, using various legal means to boldly carry out work; on the other hand, he insisted on independently developing the revolutionary armed forces and workers' and peasants' movements under the leadership of our party. At that time, some people within the party and the Comintern had another extreme view after the breakdown of the cooperation between the Nationalists and the Communists, doubting the united front policy and repeatedly criticizing Deng Xiaoping's cooperation with Yu and Li, and were highly suspicious of his united front work. However, the facts showed that it was precisely because Deng Xiaoping and other comrades, based on the specific situation in Guangxi at that time, correctly adhered to the principles and methods of the united front of our party, resisted the one-sidedness of the united front work swinging from one extreme to another, and conducted effective united front work with Yu and Li, that the revolutionary situation in Guangxi was able to undergo fundamental changes in just over two months.

First, the local party organizations in Guangxi were restored and developed. Through the work with Yu and Li, they agreed to release a large number of Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and progressive youth who had been imprisoned in the "April 12" counter-revolutionary coup. On this basis, the party organizations in various places in Guangxi gradually resumed normal activities, established and improved organizational structures, and increasingly played their role in leading the revolution and organizing the masses. Many party cadres were also arranged to hold important positions in the military and political departments of Yu and Li, greatly facilitating our party's work in military affairs and the united front.

Second, the workers' and peasants' movements were opened up and revitalized. Yu and Li accepted our party's suggestions, opened up the workers' and peasants' movements, and the trade unions and peasant associations in Guangxi were restored. The workers' and peasants' movements flourished again, and tens of thousands of workers and peasants who were mobilized became the main force of the Guangxi revolution. In August 1929, the Guangxi Provincial Peasant Representatives Conference was successfully held, marking the rapid expansion of our party's influence and strength in the rural areas of Guangxi. Yu Zuobai also agreed to issue more than 200 rifles to Wei Bagu's peasant army and conducted training in Nanning. This peasant army quickly developed and became the backbone force of the uprising and the construction of the base area.

Third, a party-controlled armed force was developed in a short period. Our party used its legal identity in the army of Yu and Li to carry out various activities and quickly controlled the Guangxi Training Brigade, the Fourth Garrison Brigade, the Fifth Garrison Brigade, and other three units with about 3,000 people. Secret party organizations were established within the troops, and most of the cadres at various levels were party members or progressive figures. Many workers, peasants, and progressive students were also recruited into the troops, changing the composition of the troops. Our party also carried out extensive democratic education activities in these troops, mobilizing soldiers to expose the bad habits of some old officers, removing some old officers, and fundamentally changing the quality, style, and combat effectiveness of the troops.

It is also worth mentioning that under the repeated enlightenment and education of Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and other comrades, Li Mingrui finally left the old army and joined the revolutionary ranks, becoming a member of the Communist Party and the commander-in-chief of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army.

It can be said that without Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and other comrades' insistence on the correct united front policy and effective united front work with Yu and Li, the above achievements would not have been possible. All of this laid a solid foundation for launching armed uprisings, creating the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies, and establishing the Left and Right River base areas.

III

The Baise and Longzhou Uprisings were an important revolutionary practice of our party in ethnic minority areas during the land revolution war. At that time, by adhering to the specific situation of the local area and adhering to the mass line, these two uprisings accumulated successful experience for our party in correctly handling ethnic relations in revolutionary struggles.

The Left and Right River areas are regions where Zhuang, Han, Yao, Miao, Yi, and other ethnic minorities live together, with a considerable proportion of the Zhuang population. Holding uprisings and building revolutionary base areas in this region, an important condition was to do a good job in ethnic minority work and handle the relationship between the Han and other ethnic minorities. This work was unfamiliar and challenging for Deng Xiaoping and others. They adhered to the policy of learning and improving in practice, worked steadily and solidly, and were good at summarizing experience in a timely manner, so that our party and its revolutionary forces blended with the local ethnic groups like milk and water, became as close as family, and forged deep class sentiments. This has important significance for promoting the revolutionary struggles in the local area and our party's ethnic work in the future.

In the revolutionary struggles in the Left and Right River areas, our party always adhered to the principle of ethnic equality and paid great attention to safeguarding and respecting the interests of the local ethnic peoples. After the uprising, there were sufficient ethnic minority cadres participating in the leadership and management of the revolutionary government at all levels. Among the 11 government commissioners of the Right River Soviet Government, there were 6 Zhuang and Yao commissioners; among the 6 Zhuang cadres in the Left River Revolutionary Committee. In the grassroots governments at all levels, local ethnic cadres also accounted for the majority. Among the commanders and party cadres of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army, there were also a large number of outstanding ethnic minority members. For matters concerning the vital interests of the local masses, our party did not interfere or impose, but fully respected the wishes of the masses and let them decide how to do it on a voluntary basis.

Another important reason why our party won the support of the ethnic minority masses in the Left and Right River areas was that it mobilized the masses to carry out the land revolution, making them stand up economically and politically. To carry out the land revolution, many leading cadres went deep into the masses to carry out propaganda and mobilization, arouse the class consciousness of the masses and improve their fighting ability, and carefully understand the wishes and demands of the masses, removing their ideological concerns. From April 5 to May 1930, Deng Xiaoping personally led the land revolution pilot in Donglan and Fengshan counties and guided the formulation of the "Temporary Land Law" and the "Joint Cultivation Regulations." To cultivate cadres and ensure the smooth progress of the land revolution, training classes were also set up to train local cadres and party members at all levels, with Deng Xiaoping personally teaching. The practice of the land revolution struggle promoted a large number of ethnic minority masses to join the revolutionary cause. Among them, many outstanding individuals sacrificed their lives, and many comrades made outstanding contributions to the Chinese revolution in the long-term struggle.

Our party also paid great attention to the cohesive and leading role of outstanding representatives of local ethnic minorities. Wei Bagu, Chen Hongtao, Huang Zhifeng, and other outstanding figures of local ethnic minorities had high prestige among the masses. Our party paid attention to mobilizing and organizing the masses through them. Under the call of the party and their leadership, a large number of outstanding young people and progressive masses of the Zhuang, Yao, and Miao ethnic minorities joined the revolutionary tide.

Today, re-examining the historical experience of the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings gives us the most profound enlightenment: whether in revolution, construction, or reform, we must start from the actual situation of our country, seek truth from facts, and walk our own path. History has shown that the Chinese revolution found a path with Chinese characteristics, that is, the path of surrounding cities from the countryside, and achieved victory only after taking into account the specific realities of the country; history will also show that the modernization construction of our country can only succeed by advancing along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and various construction and reform undertakings can only open up the correct direction by starting from the specific situation and resolutely implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    百色、龙州起义的历史经验
    于伟国
    中国革命史上著名的百色起义已经过去60年了。
    1929年12月11日和1930年2月1日，邓小平和张云逸、韦拔群、李明瑞等在广西发动并领导了百色起义和龙州起义。创建了红军第七军、第八军，开辟了左、右江革命根据地。这场艰苦卓绝的革命斗争，汇入了以毛泽东为代表的中国共产党人探索中国革命道路的历史性创造活动之中，为正在全国燃起的“工农武装割据”的星星之火，巩固和发展农村根据地，增添了新的生机和色彩，提供了宝贵的经验，成为中国革命史上一笔重要财富。
    一
    百色起义和龙州起义的成功发动，充分体现了邓小平等同志坚持从实际出发，实事求是地选择革命道路的马克思主义的思想路线和革命胆略。1927年大革命失败后，我党独立地领导武装斗争，陆续创建了一批农村根据地。但从1928年到1929年，由于各地军阀的“会剿”，加上党内“左”倾盲动政策的影响，已建立的革命根据地大多遭受严重破坏甚至失败。在这种情况下，党内有人消极悲观，怀疑工农武装割据、建立农村根据地的道路能否走下去。1929年蒋桂战争爆发后，这种状况开始发生了变化。朱德、毛泽东领导的红四军离开井冈山后，在当地党组织的配合下，开辟了赣南和闽西革命根据地，并在这年12月召开了著名的古田会议。湘鄂西、鄂豫皖、赣东北、湘鄂赣等地区的武装斗争，也战胜了初期的严重困难，开始发展起来。但是，在中国革命究竟应当走什么道路这个根本问题上，党内仍有严重分歧。百色起义和龙州起义正是在这样复杂严峻的局面下酝酿、发动的。
    起义究竟是以大中城市还是以农村为基点，这是决定起义命运的根本问题。邓小平等同志从实际情况出发，作出了正确的决策。1929年9月下旬，刚刚控制广西军政大权不久的俞作柏、李明瑞受国民党改组派的策动，仓促决定出兵反蒋。我党虽极力劝阻，但俞、李仍不改主意。这就逼迫在南宁已为我党掌握的3000人的武装力量作出抉择。当时在广西党内出现了多种主张。有的认为应随俞作柏、李明瑞去攻打陈济棠；有的主张把队伍拉到梧州、桂平一带；有的提出立即在南宁举行暴动。在这紧要关头，邓小平同志果断决定，把3000人的队伍拉到已有相当群众基础，而敌人力量却薄弱的左、右江地区，与那里的韦拔群等人领导的农军汇合，发动起义，建立革命根据地。这一符合实际的决定，保证了起义的成功。
    百色起义和龙州起义的胜利，红七军、红八军的诞生和左、右江根据地的创立，在我党领导的早期工农武装斗争和农村根据地建设中，占有重要地位。这两次起义在广西西南边陲的左、右江和红水河流域的20多个县、约5万多平方公里、100多万人口的地区，开辟了革命根据地。红七军、红八军极盛时有近万人。许多壮、瑶等少数民族的群众拿起武器，在我党的领导下英勇斗争。百色、龙州起义的重要意义，不仅在于把土地革命、武装斗争和建立农村根据地的革命烽火扩展到了左、右江地区，培育和积聚了大批党的干部和武装力量，发动了成千上万的群众投身革命，有力地打击了当地的反动军阀和豪绅地主，更重要的是，它有力地支持了全国各地正处于曲折发展中的工农武装斗争，并且在实践中再一次证明了中国革命的武装斗争必须由城市转向敌人统治薄弱的农村，建立巩固的农村根据地，走农村包围城市的道路。
    二
    坚持实事求是，特别要注意防止各种片面性。容易发生的问题是，在扭转一种片面性时，往往又摆向另一种片面性。第一次大革命失败后，党内有些同志在对待统一战线问题上，就发生了这样的错误：从一切通过统一战线，放弃主动权和领导权，转而怀疑甚至不提统一战线。在百色、龙州起义中，邓小平同志顶住压力，坚持正确的统战政策的求实精神，至今仍给我们以深刻的启示。当时，正确总结统一战线的经验教训，并在实际斗争中搞好统战工作，是党的事业面临的一项重要任务。在红七军、红八军的创建和发展过程中，这也是一个至关重要的问题。甚至可以这样说，不能坚持正确的统一战线政策和开展卓有成效的工作，就不可能成功地发动百色起义和龙州起义，就不可能有红七军和红八军。
    1929年7月，俞作柏、李明瑞主政广西后，为了在广西站稳脚跟，要求我党派一些干部去帮助工作。我党决定利用这一时机发展革命力量。邓小平、张云逸等40多位党的干部，就是这个时候先后来到广西的。当时，邓小平作为中共中央代表，全面领导广西的革命工作。他化名邓斌，先后担任中共广西前敌委员会书记，红七军、红八军政委等重要职务。邓小平同志刚到南宁遇到的一个复杂问题就是如何运用统一战线政策，在实际工作中处理好与俞作柏、李明瑞的关系，借以扩展和积蓄革命力量。在这个问题上，既突出表现了邓小平同志高超的领导艺术和政策策略水平，更充分显示了他敢于抵制错误主张，唯实不唯上的原则精神和品格特征。
    邓小平同志在处理与俞作柏、李明瑞的关系上，既看到他们的进步倾向以及与蒋、桂军阀的矛盾，又看到他们当时的局限性。因此，他一方面与俞、李积极合作，利用各种合法方式大胆开展工作；另一方面又坚持独立自主地发展我党领导下的革命武装和工农运动。当时党内以及共产国际的一些人，在国共合作破裂后产生了另一种偏激认识，对统一战线政策发生怀疑，多次指责邓小平同俞、李的合作，对他的统战工作极不信任。然而事实表明，正是由于邓小平和其他同志从广西当时的具体情况出发，正确地坚持了我党的统一战线原则和方法，抵制了统战工作从一个极端摆到另一个极端的片面性，卓有成效地开展对俞、李的统战工作，广西的革命局面才能在短短的两个多月时间里发生了根本变化。
    首先是恢复和发展了广西地方党组织及其活动。通过对俞、李的工作，他们同意释放大批在“四·一二”反革命政变中被关押的共产党员、共青团员和进步青年。在此基础上，广西各地党组织陆续恢复了正常活动，建立健全了组织机构，日益发挥其领导革命、组织群众的作用。还有不少党的干部，被安排到俞、李的军政部门担任要职，极大地便利了我党开展兵运、统战等工作。
    其次是开放和活跃了工农运动。俞、李接受了我党的建议，开放工农运动，广西的工会和农协会得到恢复，工农运动再度蓬勃兴起，成千上万被发动起来的工农群众成为广西革命的主力军。1929年8月，广西省农民代表大会胜利召开，标志着我党在当地农村的影响和力量迅速扩展。俞作柏还同意给韦拔群的农军发放步枪200多支，并在南宁进行训练。这支农军以后迅速发展，成为起义和根据地建设的骨干力量。
    第三是在较短的时间里发展了一支我党掌握的武装力量。我党利用在俞、李军队中的合法身份进行各项活动，很快控制了广西教导总队、警备第四大队、警备第五大队等3支部队约3000余人。部队中建立了秘密党组织，各级干部大多由党员或进步人士担任。还吸收了不少工农群众和进步学生到队伍中来，改变了队伍的成分。我党还在这些部队中普遍开展民主教育活动，发动士兵揭露少数旧军官的恶劣作风，撤换了一些旧军官，使部队的素质、风气和战斗力发生了根本的变化。
    这里还值得一提的是，在邓小平、张云逸等同志的反复启发教育下，李明瑞最终脱离了旧军队投入到革命队伍中来，加入了共产党，成为红七军、红八军的总指挥。
    可以肯定，如果没有邓小平、张云逸等同志始终坚持正确的统战政策和对俞、李进行卓有成效的统战工作，上述成果是不可能得到的。所有这些，都为发动武装起义，创建红七、八军，建立左、右江根据地奠定了坚实的基础。
    三
    百色、龙州起义是土地革命战争时期，我党在少数民族聚居地区的一次重要的革命实践活动。由于当时坚持从当地的具体情况出发，坚持走群众路线，这两次起义为我党在革命斗争中正确处理民族关系积累了成功的经验。
    左、右江地区是一个壮、汉、瑶、苗、彝等多民族聚居地区，其中壮族人口占相当比例。在这个地区举行起义和建设革命根据地，一个重要条件就是要做好少数民族工作，处理好汉族与其他民族之间的关系。这项工作，对邓小平等同志来说，是陌生而严峻的。他们坚持在实践中学习和提高的方针，工作稳妥扎实，善于及时总结经验，使得我党及其革命队伍与当地各民族群众水乳交融，亲如一家，结下了深厚的阶级情谊。这对于推动当地的革命斗争以及此后我党的民族工作，都具有重要意义。
    在左、右江地区的革命斗争中，我党始终坚持民族平等的原则，十分注意维护和尊重当地各族人民的利益。起义后的各级革命政权机构中，都有足够的少数民族干部参加领导管理工作。右江苏维埃政府的11名政府委员中，有6名壮、瑶族委员；左江革命委员会中也有6名壮族干部。各级基层政权中，当地民族干部也占大多数。红七军、红八军的各级指挥员和党的干部中，也有一大批少数民族的优秀成员。对于事关当地群众切身利益的事情，我党不包办不干涉，而是充分尊重群众的意愿，在他们自愿的基础上自己决定如何去做。
    我党在左、右江地区赢得少数民族群众支持的又一个重要原因，就是发动群众开展土地革命，使他们在经济上、政治上翻身。为了搞好土地革命，许多领导干部深入到群众中进行宣传发动，启发群众的阶级觉悟和提高他们的斗争能力，同时细心了解群众的愿望和要求，解除他们的思想顾虑。1930年4月5日至5月，邓小平同志曾亲自领导东兰、凤山县进行土地革命试点，并指导制定了《土地法暂行条例》、《共耕条例》等。为了培养骨干，保证土地革命的顺利展开，还开设培训班培养当地各级干部和党员，邓小平同志亲自授课。土地革命斗争的实践，推动了大批少数民族群众走上了革命的征途，其中许多优秀分子献出了自己的生命，还有许多同志在长期的斗争中为中国革命作出了突出的贡献。
    我党还十分注意发挥当地各民族优秀代表人物的凝聚和带头作用。韦拔群、陈洪涛、黄治峰等当地民族的杰出人物，在群众中具有很高的威望。我党注重通过他们去发动和组织群众。在党的号召和他们的带领下，大批壮、瑶、苗族优秀青年和进步群众投身到革命洪流中来。
    今天重温百色、龙州起义的历史经验，给我们最深刻的启示就在于，无论革命、建设还是改革都要从我国的实际情况出发，实事求是，走自己的路。历史已经表明，中国革命是根据本国的具体实际，找到了一条具有中国特色的革命道路，即农村包围城市的道路之后才取得胜利的；历史还将表明，我国的现代化建设，只有沿着有中国特色的社会主义道路前进，才能取得成功，而各项建设和改革事业，只有从具体情况出发，坚决贯彻执行党的十三大以来的路线方针和政策，才能按着正确的方向开拓前进。
