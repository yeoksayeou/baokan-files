Calligraphy is an art that has grown out of the practical use of Chinese characters. People naturally come into contact with calligraphy when they use Chinese characters, especially when they have the desire to write characters beautifully and consciously follow the rules of beauty and practice based on famous calligraphy works, they directly engage with the artistic aspect of calligraphy.

Those who write Chinese characters have a simple appreciation for calligraphy and can distinguish between what is aesthetically pleasing and what is not. This involves the issue of calligraphy appreciation. The quality, taste, and excellence of a work largely depend on the author's appreciation skills. Historically, famous calligraphers are often connoisseurs. It is precisely because of their extraordinary appreciation abilities that they have created works that have been passed down for thousands of years. Learning to appreciate calligraphy, in addition to relying on one's own creative practice, also requires borrowing from the rich experiences of predecessors.

Led by Liu Zhengcheng, a group of insightful individuals have worked tirelessly for two years to compile "The Great Dictionary of Chinese Calligraphy Appreciation," which has recently been published by Dadi Publishing House. This dictionary uses the history of Chinese calligraphy as a guide, with works as the main entries, supplemented by entries on calligraphers. Each work entry is basically composed of four parts: illustrations, introductions, collected evaluations, and appreciations. The text and images are rich, and examples of ancient and modern appreciations are gathered, making it convenient for reading and reference.

In terms of illustrations, this dictionary contains an astonishing number of works, including representative collections from the Palace Museum in Beijing, the Palace Museum in Taipei, and major museums in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Liaoning. It also includes some famous public and private collections that have been lost to Japan, the United States, and Britain, totaling nearly four thousand pieces. This is equivalent to the largest collection of Chinese calligraphy images currently available. The illustrations themselves are first-hand materials for studying the history of calligraphy and are arranged in chronological order of writing, so even if you just browse through them, you can have a direct and intuitive understanding of the development of Chinese calligraphy history.

The introduction part of the entries is a highly informative section of this dictionary. It mainly introduces the time, style, material, size, and printing situation of the work's writing (or carving and erecting), as well as the historical records and collection places or sources. This makes it convenient for readers to trace the transmission or excavation of the work and also helps readers understand the original appearance of the work.

As an appreciation-type dictionary, the collected evaluations and appreciations are the main parts of the entries. The collected evaluations are a collection of appraisals from various dynasties, these precious appraisals are gathered from more than a hundred historical works, and are further divided under each entry, arranged in chronological order with the original text, and the source of the book is noted. Reading them is like peering into the artistic images and worlds completed in the minds of ancient people, and at the same time, it is possible to understand the development and differences of ancient appreciation, and the evolutionary trajectory of ancient aesthetic concepts. If used for research, the collected evaluations also have the function of an index. The appreciation part is written by more than two hundred contemporary calligraphers, calligraphy theorists, appreciation experts, and professional calligraphy workers. They use their own cultural cultivation, aesthetic perspectives, writing styles, and language styles to depict the appeal of the work to the soul, and sketch out different artistic sensory worlds. Among them, there are not only those who follow traditional ideas to delve into the subtle aspects of the work and examine the gains and losses of ancient appreciation, but also those who provide new interpretations of the composition of the work, proposing many points that are quite different from those of predecessors.

The dictionary also includes a compilation of "Chinese Calligraphy Chronology" with ten thousand words, as well as indexes for stele works, calligrapher names, seal carver names, and hundreds of reference books for easy lookup.

    书法研究的硕果
    ——简评《中国书法鉴赏大辞典》
    丛林
    由于书法是从汉字的实用过程中生长起来的一门艺术，人们在使用汉字时，就会有意无意地与书法发生联系，特别是当你有了把汉字写得美观漂亮的欲望，并且有意识地按照美的规律去把握它，按照书法名作去练习的时候，便与艺术意味的书法发生直接联系了。
    书写汉字的人，对于书法都有一种朴素的欣赏眼光，能分辨一般的美观还是不美观，这就涉及到书法的鉴赏问题。笔下作品格调的高低、趣味的雅俗、形质的优劣，大都取决作者鉴赏的眼光。历史上的书法名家，往往就是鉴赏高手，正因为他们有非凡的鉴赏能力，才写出流传千古的佳作。学会鉴赏，除了诉诸自身的创作实践，还需要借鉴前人的丰富经验。
    以刘正成为首的一群有识之士埋头苦干了一番，罄二年的功夫终于编撰出了一部《中国书法鉴赏大辞典》，最近由大地出版社出版。这部辞书以中国书法史为引线，以作品为条目序列，辅之以书法家条目。每一作品条目基本上由图版、简介、集评、赏析四个部分构成，图文并茂，古今鉴赏范例荟萃，阅读、查考都十分方便。
    就图录而言，这部辞典收存之巨十分惊人，包容北京故宫，台北故宫，上海、南京、辽宁等地各大博物馆的代表性藏品，还有流失日本、美国、英国的一些著名公私藏品，数量近四千件，相当于一部目前容量最大的中国历代书法图录集成。图录本身既为研究书法历史的第一手资料，又按书写的年代排列汇聚，所以即使把玩一遍，也可对中国书法历史的演进有一个直观的感受和把握。
    条目中的简介部分，是这部辞典资料性很强的一项。主要介绍作品书写（或刻志立碑）的年代、书体、质地、尺寸、刊印情况，历代著录情况，收藏地或出处。便于读者查考作品的流传或者出土的端绪，也便于读者了解作品的原貌。
    作为鉴赏类的这部辞书，集评和赏析两个部分是辞条中的主干。集评是历代鉴赏点评的集萃，这些珍贵的品评，集自百余种历代论著，且又分系于各个条目之下，按时代先后条陈原文，并注明书目出处，阅读起来，仿佛窥见古人心灵中完成的一个个艺术形象与艺术世界，同时还可明了古人鉴赏的发展脉络和异同、古代审美观念演化的轨迹。若作研究，集评还具索引的功用。赏析部分是由当今二百余位书法家、书法理论家、鉴赏专家及专业书法工作者撰稿，他们用各自的文化涵养、审美视角、文章体裁、语言风格来描绘书作对心灵的感召，勾画出不同的艺术感应世界。其中，既不乏循传统的思路对书作抉幽探微，对古人鉴赏的得失加以考订，也有对作品构成予以新的阐释，提出了许多与前人迥然相异的论点。
    辞典还附有十万言的《中国书法系年》一编，碑刻作品条目索引、书法家人名索引、篆刻家人名索引三种，以及引用参考书目数百种，翻检便利。
