Xinhua News Agency, December 26, 1989

The winter training for the men's volleyball team, in preparation for the 11th Asian Games, is currently underway at the sports training base in Chen Zhou, Hunan.

Clay Weimin's Hospital Bed Instructions

In early December, Vice Minister of the State Sports Commission, Clay Weimin, fell ill and was hospitalized. The director of the Chen Zhou training base visited him in the hospital. "It's nothing, just a viral infection," Clay Weimin casually mentioned his illness, but he firmly held the visitor's hand and earnestly instructed, "The men's volleyball team at the Asian Games is not just about winning or losing a gold medal; it's about whether our country's men's volleyball team can regain its strength and break out of the slump."

This three-month closed training camp was organized under the personal supervision of Clay Weimin, with the support of various provinces, cities, and the People's Liberation Army.

Yu Youwei's Three Provisions

Since taking over as the head coach of the Chinese men's volleyball team, Yu Youwei has quit smoking, and later, he also quit drinking. He thought, if he couldn't even muster the willpower to quit these habits, how could he talk about revitalizing the men's volleyball team and breaking out of the slump? He told the team members, "Whatever I ask you to do, I will do it first. Training is the same; if I'm tired, I guarantee I won't lean on the net post. If you see me leaning, you can lie down too." Before the winter training began, the local government of Chen Zhou prepared a banquet to welcome everyone. Yu Youwei bowed and said, "I'm sorry, I appreciate the kindness, but I can't drink. If the men's volleyball team can perform well at the Asian Games, then I will definitely drink until I'm drunk!" His words moved everyone present.

The Old Captain Returns to the Battlefield

On the morning of the 16th, a familiar figure appeared on the national team's court. He was Zhang Renjiang, who had contributed to China's men's volleyball team winning the title at the previous Asian Games. In June of last year, this national team captain retired to coach the Hubei men's volleyball team. His teammate, Lu Cheng, also retired to become an assistant coach. Yu Youwei proposed that Zhang Renjiang and Lu Cheng return to the national team as athletes. The Hubei team was suddenly without a leader. When asked for Zhang Renjiang's opinion, he readily agreed, "The national team thought of us in times of difficulty and heavy tasks; it's a sign of trust. No need to say more, I'll go." He quickly packed his bags, said goodbye to his wife and children, and his team, and rushed to the base.

The National Team Takes a Midday Class

On the morning of the 16th, while other teams were training intensely, the national team quietly returned to their dormitory.

It turned out that during the morning practice of spiking and blocking, Yu Youwei judged that the veteran player Cao Maowen had made a mistake. Cao argued and missed two more balls, not only did he get penalized, but Yu Youwei also criticized him for having emotions. The entire team stopped training to rectify the training style. Yu Youwei linked these two missed balls to the revival of the men's volleyball team's glory, demanding that everyone raise higher standards in their thoughts and style. At noon, they returned to the training hall and practiced diligently until 5:30 in the afternoon.

    备战亚运　冲出低谷
    ——国家男排冬训小记
    针对第11届亚运会的男排冬训，正在湖南郴州体育训练基地进行。
    袁伟民病房嘱托
    本月上旬，国家体委副主任袁伟民患病入院。郴州训练基地主任去医院看望他。“没关系，病毒性感染。”袁伟民对自己的病轻轻一语带过，却握住对方的手语重心长地嘱托道：“男排在亚运会上不只是拿不拿得到金牌的问题，还是关系到我国排球男线能不能重新振作起来，走出低谷。”
    这次3个月的封闭式集训，就是在袁伟民的亲自主持下，经过多方努力和各省、市、解放军的鼎力支持组织起来的。
    余有为约法三章
    余有为自接手中国男排主教练后，就戒了烟，后来酒也戒了。他想，如果连这点小小的毅力都没有，何谈振兴男排，冲出低谷？他对队员们说：“要求你们做到的，我自己一定首先做到。训练也一样，累了，我保证不靠网柱子。如果看见我靠一靠，你们就可以躺一躺。”冬训开始前，郴州地、市设便餐为大家洗尘。余有为拱手致谢：“对不起，好意领了，酒不能喝。如果男排在亚运会上能打出好成绩，那时我一定喝它个醉！”一语感动四座。
    老队长重披战袍
    16号上午，在国家队的场地上出现了一个大家熟悉的人，他就是曾为中国男排在上届亚运会上夺冠立过功的张仁江。去年6月，这位国家队队长退役执教湖北男排，他的队友陆诚同时退役任助理教练。余有为提出让张仁江和陆诚重回国家队当运动员，湖北队一时没了主脑。征求张仁江的意见，他爽快地说：“国家队在困难多、任务重的时候想到了咱，是信任咱。没说的，去。”他马上打点行装，告别妻儿与自己的队伍，赶到基地。
    国家队正午补课
    16号上午，各队正练得上劲，国家队却默默地回到宿舍。
    原来，上午练扣球、拦防时，余有为判老队员曹茂稳一个失误。小曹争辩着，又扣失两个球，不仅受了罚，余有为还批评他带有情绪，全队停训，整顿训练作风。余有为把这两个失误球与重振男排雄风联系起来，要求大家在思想作风上提出更高的要求。正午，他们返回训练馆一丝不苟地练下去，直到下午5点半。　张士诚
