The Central Ballet Troupe has walked a path of artistic exploration and development for 30 years. On the occasion of celebrating its 30th anniversary, General Secretary Jiang Zemin watched the troupe's performance of the ballet "Swan Lake" and met with the performers, directors, and conductors.

Over the past 30 years, the Central Ballet Troupe has performed more than 20 major productions, including "Swan Lake," "The Sea Hawk," "Giselle," "The Little Mermaid," "Red Detachment of Women," and "The Blessing." They have also staged a large number of medium and small-scale programs, helping ballet, a Western art form, to take root in Chinese soil. The Central Ballet Troupe has nurtured many outstanding ballet dancers for the motherland. The troupe's performers have won 22 awards in international competitions and 55 awards in domestic competitions.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary, the Central Ballet Troupe performed "Swan Lake" and "Yang Guifei" and other classic productions. In the performance of "Swan Lake," three generations and five Odette performers from the troupe—Bai Shuxiang, Zhao Ruhan, Zhang Dandan, Li Ying, and Wang Shan—performed together, allowing the audience to appreciate their graceful dance movements and review the artistic journey of Chinese ballet. The following are several photos of the five "White Swans" for the readers' enjoyment.
