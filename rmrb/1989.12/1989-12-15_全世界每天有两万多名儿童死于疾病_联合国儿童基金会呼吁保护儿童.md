    Over 20,000 children die daily from diseases worldwide; UNICEF calls for child protection

    New York, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) — The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) today released an annual report stating that over 21,000 children die every day due to lack of immunity, diarrhea, and pneumonia.

    The report, titled "The State of the World's Children 1990," predicts that if the current trend of child mortality continues, over 100 million children will die from diseases in the next 10 years.

    The report indicates that diarrhea, pneumonia, tetanus, measles, and whooping cough are the five most common diseases causing child deaths, accounting for more than half of all child deaths worldwide. Despite the relatively low cost of treating these diseases, effective measures are not being taken.

    At a press conference, UNICEF Executive Director James Grant called for a summit on children's issues to be held in September 1990 to address this major social problem.

    Grant emphasized that protecting children's physical and intellectual development is the most important investment for human economic and social development.

    Grant stated that solving the health problems of children worldwide would require approximately $2.5 billion annually. This amount is equivalent to what the Soviet Union spends on vodka, what the U.S. tobacco companies spend on advertising each year, 10% of the annual agricultural subsidies given to farmers by the European Economic Community, and 2% of the annual military expenditures of developing countries.

    全世界每天有两万多名儿童死于疾病
    联合国儿童基金会呼吁保护儿童
    新华社华盛顿12月12日电  （记者陆文岳）联合国儿童基金会今天在一份年度报告中说，全世界每天有21000名儿童死于缺乏免疫力、腹泻和肺炎。
    这份题为《1990年世界儿童状况》的报告预测，按照目前儿童死亡的趋势，在未来10年中全世界将有1亿多儿童因病夭折。
    报告说，腹泻、肺炎、破伤风、麻疹及百日咳是造成儿童死亡的5种见常疾病，患这5种疾病死亡的儿童占世界死亡儿童的一半以上，尽管治疗这些疾病所需的花费不大。
    联合国儿童基金会执行干事詹姆斯·格兰特在记者招待会上呼吁在1990年9月召开儿童问题的世界首脑会议，讨论世界所面临的这一重大社会问题。
    格兰特说，保护儿童身体和智力方面的健康发展是人类经济和社会发展的最重要的投资。
    格兰特说，解决世界儿童的健康问题每年大约需要25亿美元，这相当于苏联花在伏特加酒上的钱，相当于美国烟草公司每年的广告费，相当于欧洲共同体每年给农民补贴的10％，相当于发展中国家每年军费开支的2％。
