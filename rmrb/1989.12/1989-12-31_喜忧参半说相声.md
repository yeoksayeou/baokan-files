As the most influential national variety art form, cross-talk is beloved for its unique artistic style and aesthetic appeal.

However, compared to the rich artistic potential inherent in cross-talk and the broad audience's aesthetic needs, the creation and performance of cross-talk in recent years have left much to be desired and caused concern.

Like any other art form, cross-talk also serves multiple functions: entertainment, education, cognition, and aesthetics. However, recent practices in cross-talk creation and performance have shown an overemphasis on entertainment and a deliberate avoidance of "preaching," leading to a proliferation of popular song performances and cheap "jokes" aimed solely at eliciting laughter. The cognitive function of art has been diluted, the educational function of entertainment has been lost, and the aesthetic function has been overshadowed by the pursuit of entertainment value. Classic pieces like "Buying a Monkey" and "Such a Photograph" are rare.

The primary reason for this concern is the unsatisfactory state of cross-talk creation. Professional cross-talk writers are few and far between, and many enthusiasts only dabble occasionally. The few existing cross-talk writers, lacking critical evaluation and theoretical guidance, struggle to break out of their established creative patterns. Additionally, the lack of necessary life experiences and the tendency to produce works hastily for immediate needs seriously hinder the pursuit of deep and enduring artistic goals in cross-talk creation.

At the same time, the one-sided pursuit of laughter in cross-talk performances often leads actors into the mire of vulgarity, making it difficult for them to extricate themselves. Apart from cross-talk masters like Hou Baolin, who devoted their lives to research and emphasized the importance of theory and learning, younger and mid-career cross-talk artists like Ma Ji also recognize the "confusions of cross-talk" and ponder how to break free from their own ruts. Jiang Kun is even more proactive in delving into theoretical circles, attempting to expand the realm of cross-talk and the entire variety art through research and exploration. These are all encouraging developments and worthy of reflection and caution for the new generation of cross-talk performers who have emerged in recent years.

    喜忧参半说相声
    作为曲艺艺术中最富影响的全国性大曲种，相声以其独特的艺术品格和审美趣味而备受欢迎。
    但是，与相声艺术本身所蕴藏着的丰富的艺术潜力和广大观众对相声艺术的审美需求相比，近年来相声的创作和表演不能不使人感到深深的遗憾与忧虑。
    与任何艺术一样，相声艺术同样具有娱乐、教化、认识及审美的多重功能，然而近年相声创作和表演的实践表明，过份的追求娱乐功能和有意识的远离“说教”，使得相声流于为学而“学”的流行歌曲大联唱，以及为逗而
  “逗”的廉价“包袱”大甩卖。艺术的认识功能淡化了，寓教于乐的教育功能失落了，审美功能也因过份追求娱乐效果而漠然跌落。像
  《买猴儿》、《如此照相》那样具有经典品格的优秀段子极少出现。
    形成这种忧虑的基本原因首先是相声创作的不如人意。专业的相声作家仍然寥若晨星，许多热心者也只是偶一为之，现有为数不多的相声作者也因缺少评论的观照和理论的指导而在原地徘徊，较难走出已经形成的创作模式。再加上缺乏必要的生活积累，和为应景而敷衍成篇的创作势态，严重地阻挠着相声创作通向深厚隽永的艺术追求。
    同时，相声表演中的为笑而“笑”的片面追求，使得演员往往陷入媚俗的泥沼而难以自拔。除相声大师侯宝林等一生钻研、注重理论与学养的重要性外，中青年有造诣的相声表演家如马季也意识到“说相声的困惑”，思考如何走出自身的窠臼；姜昆则更自觉地涉足理论圈，试图通过研究和探索拓展相声艺术以及整个曲艺艺术的天地。这些都是值得高兴的事，也值得近年崛起的相声表演新秀们思考和鉴戒。
