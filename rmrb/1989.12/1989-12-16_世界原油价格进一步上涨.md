Global oil prices have continued to rise.

On December 11, at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased by 22 cents per barrel, reaching $20.70.

On the same day, in the European spot market, the prices of North Sea Brent crude oil and Middle Eastern Dubai crude oil each rose by 46 cents and 38 cents per barrel, respectively, reaching $19.46 and $16.88. The factors driving the price increase include the cold weather in Europe and the United States, which has boosted demand for heating oil. Meanwhile, Soviet oil exports have significantly decreased, leading to a supply shortage.

    世界原油价格进一步上涨
    世界石油市场上原油价格进一步上涨。
    十二月十一日，在纽约商品交易所，西得克萨斯中质油的价格每桶上涨了二十二美分，达二十点七零美元。
    当天在欧洲现货市场上，英国北海布伦特原油和中东迪拜原油的价格，每桶分别上涨了四十六美分和三十八美分，分别达十九点四六美元和十六点八八美元。促使石油涨价的因素是，由于欧洲、美国气候寒冷，对取暖用油的需求增加，而另一方面苏联的石油出口剧降，造成供不应求。
