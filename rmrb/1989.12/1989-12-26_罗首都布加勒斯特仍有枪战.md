Gunfights continued in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on December 24, although the intensity of the battles had slightly decreased compared to the previous day. Fights broke out between armed forces supporting Ceaușescu and those opposing him at locations such as the television station, the Central Committee of the Communist Party building, the radio station, and the Ministry of Defense. Gunshots were also heard from the train station and the international airport.

In the cities of Sibiu, Brașov, and Cluj-Napoca, the fighting was also intense, while in the cities of Râmnicu Vâlcea, Craiova, and Arad, gunfights also occurred.

The National Salvation Front Committee issued a statement on the radio and television at noon on December 24, calling for a nationwide ceasefire. The statement also urged leaders and the public to protect economic units, shops, hospitals, schools, and to maintain public order, as well as to safeguard cultural heritage sites and facilities.

According to the National Salvation Front Committee, Ceaușescu and his wife have been arrested, as announced on the Romanian television station in Bucharest. However, this information is yet to be confirmed.
