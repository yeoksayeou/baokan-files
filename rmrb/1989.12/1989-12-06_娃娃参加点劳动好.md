During this year's wheat harvest, over 500,000 students from primary and secondary schools in rural areas of Kaifeng City did a great deed. They used their vacation time to participate in field reaping, collecting 2,174,000 kilograms of wheat, worth 2,139,000 yuan, which was used to improve teaching conditions.

Teachers-turned-officials, Kaifeng City Vice Mayor Ru Jian Guo, in response to the situation where farmers did not pay much attention to reaping due to consecutive years of agricultural abundance, resulting in serious grain wastage, suggested that the Kaifeng City Government issue a notice to "organize students to participate in reaping." County, district, and township governments, as well as school leaders, paid great attention to this, and teachers actively organized and led students to persist in reaping wheat. Through this activity, young children generally received an education on loving labor and the working people. The income was entirely used to improve teaching conditions, alleviating the difficulty of insufficient educational funds.

    娃娃参加点劳动好
    今年麦收当中，开封市50多万家居农村的中、小学生办了一件大好事，利用假期参加田间复收，拾麦217.4万公斤，折款213.9万元，用于改善教学条件。
    教师出身的开封市副市长茹建国同志，针对连年农业丰收，农民普遍不重视复收，抛撒粮食现象严重的情况，建议开封市政府发出“组织学生参加复收”的通知。各县、区、乡政府和学校领导比较重视，广大教师积极组织和带领学生坚持拾麦复收。通过拾麦活动，使少年儿童普遍受到一次热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民的品德教育；其收入全部用于改善教学条件，缓解了教育经费不足的困难。　（刘毅光）
