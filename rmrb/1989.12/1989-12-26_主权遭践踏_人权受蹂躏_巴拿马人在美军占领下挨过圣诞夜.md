Under the trampling of Panamanian sovereignty and dignity by invading U.S. troops, the residents of Panama City spent a gloomy Christmas Eve.

Usually, Panamanians would visit relatives, dance, gather, and enjoy themselves on Christmas Eve. But now, the main streets of Panama City are devoid of public buses, and pedestrians walk in small groups, holding white handkerchiefs or white cloth strips to avoid trouble from the occupying forces.

In the densely populated El Chorrillo district, the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces has been reduced to rubble, and many civilian homes have been destroyed by U.S. artillery fire. Invading tanks and armored vehicles guard every intersection.

The former headquarters of the Panamanian National Investigation Agency is now a pile of ruins. It is reported that this building was heavily bombed and shelled by U.S. forces on the 20th. The most important military base of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the Amador Fortress, is now heavily surrounded by U.S. troops. The U.S. Southern Command and the Canal Management Commission buildings are under tight security.

The Presidential Palace, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Supreme Court, among other important national institutions, are heavily guarded by armed personnel. After the U.S. invasion on the 20th, both the Presidential Palace and the Supreme Court building were looted. The U.S. Embassy is under special protection by the U.S. Marine Corps. The Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama is still surrounded by military vehicles filled with soldiers, while the U.S. troops that had surrounded the Cuban Embassy have withdrawn. The residence of the former head of government and commander of the Defense Forces, Noriega, is now occupied by many soldiers, with two street-facing doors guarded by U.S. troops.

Strategic locations such as the Bridge of the Americas and the entrances to U.S. bases and international airports are guarded by U.S. troops. In many intersections, one can still see barricades made by Panamanians using bricks, wood, discarded tires, garbage, oil drums, and cars. These barricades were used to resist the U.S. invasion. The streets and alleys of the entire city are filthy, littered with garbage, broken glass, and broken iron doors. After the U.S. invasion of Panama on the 20th, more than 70% of the city's shops were looted.

Tonight, the few supermarkets in Panama City that have not been looted are open for business under the supervision of U.S. troops, with long lines of people waiting to buy goods.

    主权遭践踏　人权受蹂躏
    巴拿马人在美军占领下挨过圣诞夜
    新华社巴拿马城12月24日电　（记者胡泰然）在入侵美军对巴拿马主权和尊严践踏下，巴拿马城的居民在沉闷的气氛中度过圣诞之夜。
    通常，巴拿马人在圣诞夜总是要走亲戚、跳舞、聚会、娱乐。可现在巴拿马城的主要大街上，公共汽车尚未通行，行人三五成群结伴而走，手里举着白手绢或白布条，以免占领军找麻烦。
    在人口稠密的乔里约区，巴拿马国防军司令部大楼已成一片废墟，许多民房也被美军炮火摧毁，入侵军的坦克和装甲车把守着各个路口。
    昔日巴拿马国家调查局大楼如今已成断垣残壁。据悉，这座建筑20日曾遭到美军的猛烈轰炸和炮击。巴拿马国防军最重要的军事基地阿马多尔要塞眼下处在美军重重包围之中。美军南方司令部和运河管理委员会大楼戒备森严。
    巴拿马总统府、外交部和最高检察院等重要国家机关大楼有大量的武装人员守卫。美军20日入侵之后，总统府和最高法院大楼都曾遭抢劫。美国使馆处在美国海军陆战队的特别保护之下。尼加拉瓜驻巴拿马大使馆仍被满载士兵的军车包围着，原来包围古巴使馆的美军已撤走了。前政府首脑、国防军司令诺列加的住宅住进了许多军人，临街的两个大门由美国兵守卫。
    一些战略要地，如美洲大桥、通往美军基地和国际机场的路口都由美军守护。在许多街口仍可以看到巴拿马人用砖石、木头、废弃轮胎、垃圾、汽油桶和汽车筑起的街垒。这些街垒曾被用作阻止美军入侵。全城的大街小巷都脏乱不堪，到处是垃圾、碎玻璃和破铁门。美军20日入侵巴拿马之后，该城有70％以上的商店遭到抢劫。
    今晚，巴拿马城里为数不多的未遭抢劫的超级市场在美军的监护下开门营业，买东西的人排起长长的队伍。
