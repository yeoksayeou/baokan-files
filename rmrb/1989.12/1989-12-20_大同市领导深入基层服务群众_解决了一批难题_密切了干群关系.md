The municipal committee and government of Datong City in Shanxi Province have taken the restoration and development of the flesh-and-blood ties between the Party and the people as a major task. Leading cadres have taken the lead in conducting investigations and research at the grassroots level, working diligently to serve the grassroots, and have received praise from the masses.

Datong City is an important coal and electricity production base in China. The stability of the workforce directly affects the political and economic stability of the region. At the beginning of the turmoil in the spring and summer of this year, the municipal leaders, led by the secretary and mayor, went deep into their respective work points to conduct investigations and understand the situation. They conveyed the spirit of the central and provincial Party committees and the decisions of the municipal Party committee to the masses, requiring the working class of the entire city to be the main force in maintaining stability. Through these efforts, the resolve of the broad masses to work together with the Party Central Committee to overcome difficulties was strengthened. In the turbulent months of May and June,

The city's coal and electricity production reached an all-time high, which was praised by Li Ronghuan, who came to inspect the work later.

Datong City's township coal mines produce more than 10 million tons of coal annually, accounting for more than half of the local coal production. To ensure the stable development of production, in early November, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Fan Rongzhi led relevant department leaders to the township mine in Gan Zhuang, Xinhong District. They went deep into the underground coal mining face, walking through corridors less than 1 meter high, inspecting the working environment of the miners. Above ground, they carefully checked the canteen, bathhouse, and single-person dormitories, requiring the mine to ensure that workers can take a hot shower, eat hot meals, and live in warm rooms after coming out of the mine. At the meeting, Fan Rongzhi heard that the miners had difficulty solving the problem of grain supply, and immediately ordered the accompanying Financial Commission director to come up with a plan to ensure the supply of grain and vegetables for the township coal mine workers.

The municipal Party committee of Datong believes that as a local Party committee, it must establish the guiding ideology of doing practical things for the grassroots. From mid-October to early November this year, the municipal Party committee and government organized 1,670 government officials into 384 teams to conduct investigations and research in the city's industrial, commercial, schools, and rural areas. When it was discovered that many key enterprises were severely affected by production due to a lack of working capital, the municipal Party committee and government found ways to allocate 10 million yuan in interest-free loans to the enterprises, effectively ensuring the stable development of production.

This year, Datong City's autumn white cabbage harvest was bountiful, but due to the early frost, there was a temporary problem of difficulty in selling the cabbage. Village cadres were anxious, and farmers were even more anxious. At this critical moment, municipal, district, and township cadres went to the villages. They ate, lived, and worked with the farmers and actively helped the farmers find channels to sell the cabbage. The municipal Party committee and government required all units in the city to treat the storage of winter vegetables as a political task, protecting the enthusiasm of vegetable farmers to grow vegetables. The municipal government also allocated 3 million yuan to compensate farmers for their losses, and the farmers were deeply moved.

    大同市领导深入基层服务群众
    解决了一批难题  密切了干群关系
    本报讯　山西省大同市委、市府把恢复发展党和人民的血肉联系当作一项重要工作来抓，领导干部带头深入基层调查研究，脚踏实地为基层服务，受到群众赞扬。
    大同市是我国重要的煤、电生产基地，职工队伍能否稳定直接关系到该地区政治和经济的能否稳定。在今年春夏之交的动乱初期，以市委书记、市长为首的市级领导干部深入各自的工作点调查了解，把中央、省委的精神以及市委的决策意图传达给群众，要求全市工人阶级争当稳定大局的主力军。通过这些工作，坚定了广大群众同党中央同舟共济、共渡难关的决心。在动乱的5、6月份，                
    全市煤炭、电力生产创造了历史最高水平，受到了后来到这里视察工作的李瑞环同志的表扬。
    大同市乡镇煤矿年产量超千万吨，占地方煤炭产量一半多。为了持续稳定地发展生产，11月初，市委书记樊荣枝带领有关部门领导到新荣区的乡镇矿——甘庄煤矿，他们深入井下采煤工作面，在不足1米高的巷道穿行，察看矿工们的生产工作环境。井上，他们认真检查了解职工食堂、澡塘、单身宿舍，要求矿上一定要保证工人出井能洗上热水澡，吃上热饭，住上暖房。座谈会上，樊荣枝听到矿工吃粮不好解决时，当即要求随行的财委主任拿出计划，必须保证乡镇煤矿工人的口粮和蔬菜供应。
    大同市委认为，作为一级地方党委，必须确立为基层办实事的指导思想。今年10月中旬至11月上旬，市委、市政府抽调1670名机关干部组成384个组，深入全市工交、财贸、学校、农村调查研究。当发现不少骨干企业因流动资金不足、严重影响生产时，市委、市府设法挤出1000万元贴息拨给企业，有力地保证了生产的稳步发展。
    今年，大同市秋季大白菜喜获丰收，但由于早霜降临，一时间出现了卖菜难问题，村干部着急、农民更着急。关键时刻市、区、乡三级干部下到农村，他们与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，并积极帮助农民联系卖菜渠道。市委、市政府要求全市各单位以政治任务对待冬菜的储备，保护菜农的种菜积极性。市里同时又拿出300万元补贴菜农损失，农民十分感动。
