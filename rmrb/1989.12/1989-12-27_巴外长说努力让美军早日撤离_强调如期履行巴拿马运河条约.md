Panama's Foreign Minister Says Efforts to Expedite U.S. Military Withdrawal
Emphasizes Full Implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty

	New York Times, December 25, 1989 - Panama's new Foreign Minister, Julio Linares, stated today that the Panamanian government will make every effort to minimize the duration of the U.S. military presence in Panama.

	He said, "The best defense for the Panama Canal is to ensure its neutrality, because although Panama is a small country, its geographical location allows it to contribute to all of humanity."

	In his statement, Linares denied the possibility of Panama making concessions to the United States during the period of U.S. military occupation. He said, "As long as Endara is in power and as long as I am the Foreign Minister, there will be no agreement signed with the United States that implies ceding territory to the United States."

	Linares reiterated, "The Panama Canal Treaty will be fully implemented, meaning that by December 31, 1999, the canal and all its facilities will be returned to Panama."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25, 1989 - Panama City: The new leader of Panama's public security forces, Colonel Amilho, announced on December 25 that 80% of Panama's military personnel are now under the control of the new government.

	Amilho, the former leader of Panama's navy, was arrested for his involvement in an unsuccessful coup against Noriega but was released after the U.S. military invaded Panama on December 20.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, December 25, 1989 - (Reporters Hu Tairan and Meng Jun) Panama's new first vice president and minister of the interior and justice, Arias Calderon, stated today that the situation in Panama is returning to normal.

	Calderon said at a press conference held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the new government's temporary office) that the chaos in Panama following the U.S. invasion on December 20 has largely subsided. The second largest city, Colon, has completely returned to calm.

    巴外长说努力让美军早日撤离
    强调如期履行巴拿马运河条约
    新华社巴拿马城12月25日电　巴拿马新政府外交部长胡利奥·利纳雷斯今天对报界说，巴拿马政府将尽“最大努力使美军在巴拿马停留的时间尽可能短”。
    他说，“对巴拿马运河的最好的防卫是使其中立化，因为巴拿马虽然是一个小国，但却能以其所处的地理位置对整个人类做出贡献。”
    胡利奥在声明中否定了在美国军事占领巴拿马期间巴可能会对美做出让步的说法。他说，“只要恩达拉执政，只要我担任外长，就不会与美国签订任何意味着把领土让给美国的协议”。
    胡利奥重申，“巴拿马运河条约一定得到履行，也就是说，到1999年12月31日运河及它的一切设施都将归还巴拿马。”
    据新华社北京12月25日电  巴拿马城消息：巴拿马新成立的公安部队领导人阿米霍上校25日宣布，巴拿马全国80％的军人都已在新政府的控制之下。
    阿米霍是巴拿马前海军领导人，曾因参与反诺列加未遂政变遭逮捕，后在美军20日入侵巴拿马后获释。
    据新华社巴拿马城12月25日电　（记者胡泰然、孟军）巴拿马新政府第一副总统兼内政和司法部长阿里亚斯·卡尔德隆今天指出，目前巴拿马局势已趋正常。
    卡尔德隆今天在外交部大楼（新政府临时办公处）举行的记者招待会上说，美军20日入侵之后巴拿马的混乱局面已基本结束。第2大城市科隆已完全恢复平静。
