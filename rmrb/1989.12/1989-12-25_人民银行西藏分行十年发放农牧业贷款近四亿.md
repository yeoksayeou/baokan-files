The People's Bank of China's Tibet Branch has issued a cumulative total of 390 million yuan in agricultural and pastoral loans from 1980 to the present, promoting the development of Tibet's agricultural and pastoral economy.

According to reports, in recent years, the Tibet Branch has, based on local conditions, shifted its loan focus from primarily supporting village-level agricultural and pastoral development to prioritizing support for individual farmers and herders in production and diversified operations. The focus has also shifted from supporting production links to supporting the entire production process, including production, circulation, distribution, and consumption. The approach has moved from emphasizing lending over collection and management, with little regard for economic benefits, to centering on improving the economic benefits of loans, conducting thorough feasibility studies. In terms of loan conditions, the branch prioritizes serving individual farmers, herders, and cooperative economic organizations, providing significant benefits to farmers and herders.

Statistics show that over the past decade, the average annual loan issuance by credit cooperatives in the entire region has been nearly 40 million yuan. In 1988, agricultural and pastoral loans exceeded 100 million yuan, and by October of this year, 120 million yuan in loans had already been issued.

    人民银行西藏分行十年发放农牧业贷款近四亿
    新华社拉萨12月24日电（记者罗布次仁）中国人民银行西藏分行1980年至今累计发放农牧业贷款3.9亿多元，促进了西藏农牧业经济的发展。
    据介绍，近年来西藏分行根据当地实际，贷款方式从过去主要支持乡村发展农牧业转为重点支持农牧户发展生产和多种经营，从支持生产环节转为支持生产、流通、分配、消费等整个生产过程，从过去重贷轻收、重贷轻管、不讲究经济效益转为以提高贷款经济效益为中心，进行细致的可行性研究。在贷款条件方面以为农牧户和合作经济组织服务为宗旨，给农牧民以极大的优惠。
    据统计，近10年全区信用社平均每年发放贷款近4000万元，1988年农牧业贷款突破1亿元，今年至10月发放贷款就达1.2亿元。
