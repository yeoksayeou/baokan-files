This October, as the magazine subscription work began, some units in a certain base of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission in Shaanxi Province showed some deviations. They only wanted to subscribe to magazines with strong knowledge, interest, and entertainment value, neglecting the subscription of party newspapers and magazines. After relevant leaders discovered this situation, they promptly issued a notice, clearly stating that the important party newspapers and magazines such as the *People's Daily* and *Seeking Truth* should be subscribed to by every branch at the grassroots level. Those that have not subscribed should do so within a short period. This deviation was quickly corrected.

    党报党刊订到基层
    今年10月，报刊订阅工作展开后，国防科工委驻陕西某基地的个别单位出现了一些偏差，只愿订知识性、趣味性和娱乐性强的报刊，忽视对党报党刊的订阅。有关领导发现这一情况后，及时发了通报，明确指出要将《人民日报》、
  《求是》等重要的党报党刊订到基层每一个支部，没有订到的要在近期内迅速补订，这一偏向很快得到纠正。
