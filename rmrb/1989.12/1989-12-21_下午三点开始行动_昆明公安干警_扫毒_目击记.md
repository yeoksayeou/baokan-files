	After 2 PM on December 20, the reporter entered the gate of the Kunming Public Security Bureau. Motorcycles were lining up inside the walls, and the police officers were about to set out to clean up the black market in the Tangzi Alley area of the city, which was filled with "poisonous" fumes. The operation was scheduled to begin at 3 PM. The reporter arrived at the Tangzi Alley area ahead of time. This is a street with 6 exits, where many people were holding locally produced brand-name cigarettes or foreign cigarettes, actively selling them to passersby. Some were also selling old cassette tapes and VHS tapes... These people kept looking around.

	A middle-aged man suddenly bumped into the reporter and, lowering his voice, asked, "Do you want to buy a VHS tape?" Turning around, five or six tapes were handed over, labeled "Not Suitable for Children" and featuring fight scenes. The reporter pretended to hesitate, and the man, like a magician, pulled out two more tapes from his pocket, whispering, "These are copied, not expensive..." The reporter shook his head and left, and the man turned to someone else. At 2:54 PM, there were 6 minutes left until the scheduled operation time.

	At exactly 3 PM, without a second to spare, two police cars with flashing red lights rushed in, instantly blocking the exits in the north and south directions. The stern police officers quickly jumped out of the cars and rushed over. At the same time, the ambush police officers leaped out like lightning, and within a few seconds, the predetermined individuals engaged in illegal transactions were surrounded, with both the people and the evidence seized. The reporter saw the man who had been selling VHS tapes being caught by the police.

	30 minutes later, more than a hundred individuals involved in illegal activities, along with the evidence, were taken away from the scene. The onlookers cheered in approval.

    下午三点开始行动
    ——昆明公安干警“扫毒”目击记
    本报记者　钱江
    12月20日下午二时以后，记者走进昆明市公安局大门。墙内的摩托车正在列队，干警即将出动，扫除市区塘子巷一带泛着“毒气”的黑市场。行动预定下午3点开始。记者先一步走进塘子巷街区。这是一段有6个出口的马路，不少人手持当地产的名牌卷烟或外国香烟，主动地向路人兜售，还有人在卖外壳陈旧的录音带、录像带……这些人不时东张西望。
    一个中年男子突然撞了记者一下，压低声音问：“录像带可要？”扭头一看，五六盘带子递了过来，是书有“儿童不宜”的打斗片。记者故作迟疑，那人竟像变戏法似的从怀里掏出两盘带子，悄声说：“转录的，不贵……”记者摇头离去，那人又转向别处。2点54分，离预定的行动时间还有6分钟。
    3点正，分秒不差，只见两辆闪着红灯的警车呼啸而来，刹那间在南北两个方向堵住路口。警容庄严的干警急速跳下车飞奔过来。同一时刻，设伏干警闪电般跃出，前后几秒钟，预先看定的从事违法交易的人被团团围住，人赃俱获。记者一眼看见刚才兜售录像带的人被警察抓住了。
    30分钟后，人赃俱获的百余名违法活动者被带离现场。围观的群众纷纷叫好。
