Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th.

The State Tourism Administration recently decided to continue suspending business ties with Hong Kong's Gaomei Tourism Trade Company, Taiwan's Wanbao Road Travel Agency, the U.S. Capital Travel Agency, and Hong Kong's Xiaoshanshan Travel Agency. It also decided to temporarily and conditionally resume business ties with Japan's Donghua Travel Agency.

At today's press conference, a relevant official from the State Tourism Administration expressed the hope that both domestic and foreign travel agencies will adhere to China's tourism regulations and engage in lawful operations in the future. Domestic travel agencies must follow the regulations of the tourism administrative management department and adhere to the principle of "collecting fees first, then providing services" to avoid economic losses.

    在今天举行的新闻发布会上，国家旅游局有关方面负责人希望国内、外旅行社在今后的业务关系中遵守中国的旅游法规，合法经营。国内旅行社要执行旅游行政管理部门的规定，坚持“先收费、后接待”的原则，避免经济损失。
