In the Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone in Shanghai, there is a new customs house that has just completed its third year. The customs officers are clean and upright, untouched by the slightest bit of corruption. This spring, the supervisor of the customs inspection team, Fan Ren Yong, received a letter. Upon opening it, he found that it was a notice of admission for his son's job application. This should have been a joyous occasion, but Fan's usually relaxed brow furrowed.

It turned out that the son, Wen Sheng, had been admitted to a joint venture company that Fan himself was directly responsible for supervising. If his son were to work at the company he supervised, who knows what kind of trouble might arise. He thought of himself as an old customs officer who had been a party member for many years, and that to uphold the law and be honest and upright, he must make his son "step aside." Some people said, "The child was admitted based on his abilities, why can't he go?" Fan smiled and said, "Working elsewhere is the same."

Coincidentally, in the first half of this year, the joint venture company that was supposed to admit Wen Sheng had a batch of machinery and equipment that was shipped out of the development zone without customs clearance. After the incident was discovered, Fan and his colleagues handled it with a clear conscience and without hesitation. Now, recalling the incident, Fan has much to say: "If my son were working at this company, it would be difficult for a father with power to act impartially."

One late summer evening, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Minhang Development Zone Customs, Tang Fu Xiang, had just put down his chopsticks when he heard someone knocking at the door. The visitor was a customs declarant from a company in the development zone. Seeing that he was carrying two boxes of ginseng and royal jelly, Tang's face immediately darkened.

"You have business to discuss? Please come to the office. Customs officers' homes are not for receiving clients."

"Oh, Director Tang, you're misunderstanding. I'm just here to make friends, a small token, please accept it, and I'll be on my way."

Tang knew the true intention of the visitor. A month ago, this company had shipped a batch of imported duty-free goods out of the development zone without customs clearance, and the customs were investigating the matter. Today, the customs declarant's visit was obviously to "test the waters," hoping to find a way in. Tang had his mind made up—he would not trade principles. So, he pointed at the royal jelly and said, "If you don't take it back, I'll hand it over to our leaders tomorrow, and they will give it to your company's manager. What do you think?"

The customs declarant heard the firmness in Tang's words and had no choice but to leave in disappointment.

Soon, a manager from the company's operations department came to visit Tang. After some pleasantries, he took out a high-end imported electric shaver that he had prepared earlier, saying it was a small gift from someone else, and insisted that Tang "accept it." Tang laughed, "Please don't do this. Your company's matter, we will handle it officially, please don't come to me." At this, the manager couldn't help but sigh, "Ah, I didn't expect you to be so serious about your work!"

Located in the center of the development zone, the Xerox Copier Factory is a well-known Sino-American joint venture. Even in its early days, the factory faced a major problem. The large number of imported parts could not be matched and delivered, and customs could not release them. One Sunday, Customs Director Zhang Jin Hua suddenly appeared in the factory's warehouse. After investigation and research, he suggested to the factory that they use their advanced computer equipment to monitor the incoming materials warehouse. That is, imported materials first enter the warehouse, and the computer "records" and "matches" them, then releases them based on the "matched" items. For the factory, as long as the imported materials are "recorded" by the warehouse computer, they can be used. This way, inspection and production can proceed without interference. Zhang Jin Hua often came to the factory, and finally realized the computer monitoring of the incoming materials warehouse, ensuring the smooth operation of the factory's production.

One day, Director Zhang came to the factory to understand the situation. The manager of the internal and external relations department smiled and handed over a package of gifts: "A small token. Two sets of wool suit fabric. This is what every worker in the factory receives, and today you came, it's just a coincidence." The manager said as he pushed the gift into Zhang's hand. Old Zhang waved his hands repeatedly: "This gift, I will not accept. Promoting the development of the enterprise's export-oriented economy, we have a responsibility. The gift is not accepted, but the matter will be handled. In the future, we will still do our best to give the green light to the healthy development of the enterprise!"

    把“关”
    夏儒阁　姚俊康
    在上海闵行经济技术开发区，有一家刚满三载的新海关。关员们政廉风清不染一尘，涉足“肥水”未湿双鞋。今年开春的一天，开发区海关监管一组组长范仁勇收到一封来信。拆开一看，原来是一家中外合资企业给自己儿子应聘考试的录取通知书。这本是一桩喜事，然而，老范那一向舒展的双眉却紧蹙起来。
    原来，儿子文胜考取的这家合资工厂偏偏就是老范直接监管的对象。如果儿子到了自己监管的单位工作，保不准也会闹出什么“名堂”来。他想到自己是一名入党多年的老关员，要秉公执法，廉洁奉公，就必须让儿子“回避”。有人说：“孩子是凭本事考取的，有啥去不得。”老范笑着说：“到其它地方工作也一样。”
    说来也巧，今年上半年，要录取文胜的这家合资企业有一批机器设备未经海关许可运出了开发区。案发后，老范和同事在查处时理直气壮，义无反顾。而今提及，老范颇有感慨：“假如儿子在这个单位工作，父亲手中有权恐怕就难以秉公办事了。”
    今年盛夏的某晚，开发区海关业务科副科长汤富祥刚放下碗筷，忽然听到有人敲门。来人是开发区某公司的报关员。老汤一看他拎着两盒人参蜂皇浆，脸立即沉了下来。
    “你有事请到办公室谈，海关关员家里是不该接待客户的。”
    “啊呀呀，汤科长你说到哪去了？我今儿来不为别的，交个朋友，一点小意思，你收下，我就走。”
    老汤知道对方的真正来意。一个月前，这家公司未经海关许可，擅自把一批进口保税货物运出开发区，海关正在查处。今天这位报关员登门，无疑是来“投石问路”，想从他这里打开缺口。老汤心中有谱——决不能拿原则做交易。于是，他指着蜂皇浆说：“你不拿回去，我明天交给我们领导，由领导再交给贵公司经理，你看如何？”这位报关员听出老汤的话里不留余地，只得悻悻而去。
    不久，这家公司经营部的一位经理登门拜访老汤。一番寒暄后，他拿出一把早已准备好的进口高级电动剃须刀，说是别人送的小礼品，务请老汤“笑纳”。老汤噗哧一笑：“请你别这样。你们公司的事，我们海关会公事公办的，请你不用找我了。”至此，这位经理不禁长叹一声：“哎，没想到，你们办事是这样当真啊！”
    坐落在开发区中心的施乐复印机总厂，是一家闻名遐迩的中美合资企业。还在开工初期，复印机厂就遇到一个很大的难题。他们大量进口的料件不能配套到货，海关无法验放。一个星期天，张锦华关长突然出现在工厂的仓库里。经过调查研究，他向工厂建议，利用他们先进的电脑设备，对进料仓库实行监控。就是说，进口料件先进入仓库，由电脑“入帐”、“配套”，然后根据“配套”件验放。对工厂来说，只要进口料件由仓库电脑“入了帐”，就可使用。这样，就能做到验放、生产两不误。张锦华经常来工厂，终于实现了对进料仓库实行电脑监控，使工厂生产顺利进行。
    有一天，张关长又来到工厂了解情况，厂内外关系部的经理笑盈盈地递上一包礼品：“小意思。两套毛料西装的料子。这是厂里每个工人都发的，今天你来，算是凑巧。”经理边说边朝老张手上塞。老张连连摆手道：“这份礼，我是决不收的。促进企业发展外向型经济，我们责无旁贷。礼不受，事照办。今后还是要尽我们的力量为企业的健康发展开绿灯！”
