Controlling population growth requires implementing family planning, which not only suits China's national conditions but also aligns with the wishes of the people. We have deep insights into this aspect.

Our county began family planning work in the early 1960s. The county committee and government have consistently regarded it as a strategic measure for building a prosperous new Taicang, advocating the slogan "increase material production and reduce population growth." This has made family planning work increasingly effective. In the 1960s, the people voluntarily had fewer children, in the 1970s, they spaced out having a second child, and in the 1980s, they had only one child. Since advocating for one child per couple, no party member or cadre has had an unplanned birth. The county's family planning rate has been above 91% since 1980 and above 99.5% since 1983. Since 1971, the county's natural population growth rate has been below 10‰, and since 1980, the annual average natural growth rate has been 2.58‰. The county's annual population growth rate was 1.45% in the 1950s, 1.34% in the 1960s, 0.71% in the 1970s, and 0.39% in the 1980s. From 1949 to 1988, the county's total population increased from 302,000 to 443,000, a growth of 46.7%, which is 55.2% lower than the national growth rate and 33.6% lower than the provincial growth rate during the same period.

Effective population control has reduced many complex social burdens, fundamentally providing the basis and conditions for revitalizing the rural economy and enriching the people. The logic is simple: one person eating one bowl of rice is better than several people sharing one bowl of rice.

We have deep insights into this. We often use the following account to motivate and spur ourselves, as well as educate and enlighten cadres and the masses to consciously implement family planning. We have saved 500 million yuan in child-rearing expenses; saved 3.375 million days of maternity leave, which, if calculated based on last year's per capita GDP of 3,126 yuan, amounts to 289.06 million yuan; and the difficult and widespread social problems of employment, education, housing, and medical care have not been prominently reflected in our region.

The county has solved the employment problem for young people and the issue of old-age support for the elderly for many consecutive years. In 1987, the county had 28.51 hospital beds per 10,000 people, ranking second in Jiangsu Province. The number of doctors and medical technicians per 10,000 people were 14.91 and 32.52, respectively, both ranking first in Jiangsu Province. In 1988, the enrollment rates for primary and junior high schools were 100% and 98.8%, respectively. Last year, the county's per capita fiscal contribution to the state was 354 yuan, ranking second in Jiangsu Province. The per capita savings of urban residents were 1,109 yuan, and that of rural residents were 687 yuan, both ranking first in Jiangsu Province.

Currently, 70% of rural households in the county have built stylish new houses, with an average living area of 39 square meters, and the per capita living area for urban residents is 12.6 square meters.

Of course, the changes in rural areas and the improvement in the people's material living standards are mainly due to the correctness of the Party's policies and the resulting development of productivity. But we have indeed "benefited from family planning."

Therefore, I believe that adhering to the "two-pronged approach" of controlling population growth is a way to revitalize rural areas and enrich the people.

### 控制人口增长　繁荣农村经济

    控制人口增长　繁荣农村经济
    江苏省太仓县县长　张宗民
    控制人口增长，就要实行计划生育，这不仅适合我国的国情，也是群众的愿望。这方面我们是有深刻体会的。
    我县从60年代初期就开展了计划生育工作。县委和政府一直把它作为建设富庶新太仓的战略措施来抓，提出了“物质生产要上去，人口增长要下来”的口号，使计划生育工作步步深入，成效日益显著。60年代群众自觉少生，70年代间隔生二胎，80年代生一孩。自从开始提倡一对夫妇只生育一个孩子以来，党员干部中没有一人无计划生育。全县计划生育率1980年开始保持在91％以上，1983年开始保持在99.5％以上。1971年开始，全县人口自然增长率降到10‰以内，1980年以来年平均自然增长率为2.58‰；全县人口年平均增长速度50年代为1.45％，60年代为1.34％，70年代为0.71％，80年代为0.39％。1949到1988年，全县总人口由30.2万人增加到44.3万人，增长46.7％，比同期全国增长幅度低55.2％，比同期江苏省增长幅度低33.6％。
    人口的有效控制，减轻了诸多复杂的社会负担，从根本上为繁荣农村经济、农民致富提供了基础和条件。这道理很简单，一人一碗饭总比几人一碗饭吃得好，吃得饱。
    这方面我们是深有体会的。我们常常以这样一笔帐来激励和鞭策自己，也教育和启发干部群众，自觉抓好计划生育。节约扶育费5亿元；节省生育产假337.5万天，若按去年我县人均创造国民生产总值3126元计算，即2890.6万元；就业难、上学难、住房难、就医难等棘手而又普遍存在的社会问题，在我们这个地区就没有突出的反映。
    全县已多年连续解决了青年的就业问题和老年人老有所养的问题；1987年全县每万人拥有医院床位28.51张，名列江苏省各县第二位；每万人拥有医生和卫生技术人员分别为14.91和32.52人，均列江苏省各县之首；1988年全县小学、初中的入学率分别达到100％和98.8％，去年全县人均向国家贡献财政收入354元，名列江苏省第二位，城镇居民人均储蓄1109元，农村人均储蓄687元，名列江苏省各县之首。
    目前全县农村已有70％的农户盖起了式样新颖的楼房，平均居住面积39平方米，市镇居民人均居住面积12.6平方米。
    当然，农村的变化和群众物质生活水平的提高，主要来自党的方针政策的正确及其因此而带来的生产力的发展。但我们确实是“占了计划生育的光”。
    因此，我认为坚持“两手抓”的方针，控制人口的增长是繁荣农村、致富于民的途径。
