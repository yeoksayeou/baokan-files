The African sports community will continue its struggle against South Africa's apartheid policy in sports.

The New China News Agency reported from Harare on December 12 that the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, which held a meeting in Mauritania last week, reaffirmed that African countries will continue their unyielding struggle against the practice of racial segregation in sports.

According to reports from local newspapers today, the decision by the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa has received the support of the International Olympic Committee and some national governments and sports organizations.

The meeting criticized the British sports authorities for supporting South Africa's apartheid policy.

The meeting called on African sports organizations to suspend sports exchanges with Britain until it ends its support for South Africa.
