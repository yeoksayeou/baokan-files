According to reports, several recent national procurement meetings have set a new precedent, with everyone praising them as being honest and fair. The reasons for this are, of course, related to the current "big environment"; on the other hand, it is also inseparable from the fact that the National Supervision Department dispatched supervisory teams to various venues in advance to strengthen disciplinary supervision. The author believes that this kind of "preventive supervision" is very worthy of promotion.

In the past, supervisory and disciplinary inspection departments often only conducted investigations and handling after disciplinary violations had occurred. However, due to the complexity of the situation, the investigation and handling work is often very arduous, and once a disciplinary violation occurs, it has already produced adverse consequences. In contrast, implementing "preventive supervision" under possible conditions has a proactive preventive function. It can reduce the likelihood of party and government officials making mistakes and also reduce the passive input required for handling cases after they occur, saving manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It can be said that this is an efficient method. It is like treating a disease versus preventing one; if more preventive work is done, the occurrence of the disease can be reduced.

The author believes that, in addition to dispatching supervisory teams to relevant meetings and activities, the scope and range of "preventive supervision" can be appropriately expanded to better carry out supervisory and disciplinary inspection work.

    多一些“事前监督”
    齐殿斌
    据报道，不久前召开的几个全国性订货会开出了新风气，大家的评价是：称得上廉洁公正。究其原因，固然与当前的“大气候”有关；另一方面，与国家监察部事前向各会场派驻监察组，加强纪律监督也是分不开的。笔者以为，这种“事前监督”很值得提倡。
    以往，监察、纪检部门多是在违纪现象发生之后才去调查处理。但是，由于情况复杂，查处工作往往十分艰巨，而且违纪现象一旦发生，就已经产生了不良的后果。而在可能的条件下实行“事前监督”，就具有积极预防的功能。它既可以减少党政干部犯错误的可能性，又可以减少案发后查处的被动投入，节省人力、物力、财力。可以说，这是一种提高效率的好方法。这就好比治病与防病一样，如果能多做一些预防工作，就会减少疾病的发生。
    笔者以为，除向有关会议、活动派出监察组外，还可以适当扩大“事前监督”的领域和范围，以更有效地搞好监察、纪检工作。
