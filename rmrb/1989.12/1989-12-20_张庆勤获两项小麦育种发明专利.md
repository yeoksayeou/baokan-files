The State Patent Bureau recently awarded Professor Zhang Qingqin of Guizhou Agricultural College two invention patents: "Hybridization Technology of Wheat and Wild Oats" and "Three-Line Male Sterile System of Qian-Type Wheat."

Hybridizing wheat with wild oats is a highly challenging research endeavor. Zhang Qingqin, after more than a decade of dedication, has successfully cultivated a wheat male sterile line with a 100% sterility rate and a wheat restorer line with a 90% to 100% restoration rate.

The first-generation hybrids produced exhibit three significant advantages: high tillering, high grain number per ear, and high thousand-grain weight.

    张庆勤获两项小麦育种发明专利
    据新华社贵阳12月19日电　（记者刘子富）国家专利局最近给贵州农学院教授张庆勤颁发“小麦属与野生燕麦远缘杂交技术”和“黔型小麦雄性不育系三系”的发明专利证书。
    小麦属与野生燕麦重复杂交是项难度很大的研究。张庆勤历经10余载，培育的小麦不育系不育率达100％，小麦恢复系恢复率达90％至100％。
    繁殖出来的杂交一代具有比较强的三大优势：即分孽成穗、平均穗粒数以及千粒重都较好。
