The mismanagement of production and sales plans for fertilizers in Binhai County has led to a significant issue. Since late September, a large quantity of urea has been transported into the county, resulting in an accumulation of over 7,500 tons of ammonium bicarbonate in the county's fertilizer factory. This has caused a cash flow problem, and due to the prolonged storage and open-air stacking, there has been considerable damage to the packaging and the product itself. If this situation is not promptly addressed, the factory may be forced to halt production, which would adversely affect agricultural production this winter and next spring.

    叫人着急
    滨海县化肥生产、购销计划失调，九月下旬以来调入大量尿素，导致了县化肥厂内碳铵积压达七千五百多吨，资金无法周转，加上积压时间长、露天堆放，包装袋和产品损耗可观。如不及时改善这种状况，一旦工厂被迫停产，将给今冬明春的农业生产带来不利的影响。
