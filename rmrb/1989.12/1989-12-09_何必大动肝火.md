Title: No Need to Fly into a Rage

Recently, the Second Committee of the 44th United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution opposing the use of economic coercion against developing countries. The preamble of this resolution mentions the issue of establishing a new international economic order. The U.S. representative not only voted against the resolution but also flew into a rage, unreasonably criticizing the proposal to establish a new international economic order as an "outdated bad idea." It seems that raising such an issue in this international organization is tantamount to committing a grave offense.

Everyone knows that, apart from internal factors, the various economic difficulties faced by developing countries today are largely due to an irrational international economic order. Issues such as high interest rates from creditor banks, developed countries suppressing raw material prices, and trade protectionism, as well as some Western countries frequently imposing economic sanctions on developing countries for their own interests—whether by banning trade and loans, freezing other countries' assets, or unilaterally tearing up agreements and wantonly disrupting normal relations between countries—all prove that breaking away from the old unequal international economic relations and establishing a new international economic order based on equality and mutual benefit is not only not "outdated," but should be an urgent task for the international community. On the contrary, the United States' efforts to maintain the old international economic order are merely rehashing outdated tunes. Moreover, the United States and other countries often use economic means to pressure other countries, and their actions are not just "bad ideas," but malicious acts of hegemony. Therefore, it is no surprise that they faced so much opposition at the United Nations General Assembly.

    何必大动肝火
    近日，第四十四届联大第二委员会通过一项决议，反对用经济手段胁迫发展中国家。这项决议的序言提到建立国际经济新秩序的问题，美国代表不仅投票反对上述决议，而且对此大动肝火，无理指责建立国际经济新秩序的主张是“过时的坏念头”。似乎在这个国际组织中提出这样的问题是大逆不道。
    谁都知道，当前发展中国家的种种经济困难除了内部因素之外，不合理的国际经济秩序是一个重要因素。诸如债权银行的高利率、发达国家的压低原料价格和贸易保护主义等，还有一些西方国家为了一己私利，动辄对发展中国家实行经济制裁，或是禁止贸易和贷款，或是冻结别国资产，或是单方面撕毁协议，恣意破坏国与国之间的正常关系。回顾历史，联系现实，恰恰证明打破旧的不平等的国际经济关系，建立以平等互利为基础的国际经济新秩序的主张非但没有“过时”，而且应当是国际社会的一项紧迫任务。相反，美国竭力维护旧的国际经济秩序的种种主张，才是重弹不合时宜的老调。不仅如此，美国等国经常采用经济手段对别国施压，其行动就不只是一种“坏念头”，而是一种强权政治的恶劣行为。因而它在联合国大会上遭到众多反对，也就不足为怪了。　·彦忠·
