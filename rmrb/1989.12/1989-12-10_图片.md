Title: Before the Door, Invitations Are Scarce; Oil and Water Do Not Enter the Belly
Author: Xǔ Qīngtiān

Edition: 8

	Before the door, invitations are scarce;
	Oil and water do not enter the belly.
	The belt loosens gradually, yet regret is hard to bear;
	Upright governance wears people out.

		(From the November 28th issue of *Liberation Daily*, a poem by Xǔ Qīngtiān with an accompanying illustration)

    门前冷落请柬稀　油水不入腹内饥
    衣带渐宽终难悔　廉政消得人憔悴
