The Chinese Theatre in Hollywood was established in 1927. Over the past 60 years, it has welcomed countless artists and tourists from all five continents. At its entrance, there are a pair of stone lions, and at the corners of the building, there are decorations of halberds and dragon-phoenix carvings. On May 18 of that year, during the premiere of "The King of Kings," playwright Norman Talmadge accidentally stepped on the wet cement, leaving her footprints. This accidental act became a custom, and since then, 160 famous actors have left their handprints and signatures on the cement in front of the Chinese Theatre, making it a holy land in Hollywood.

Displaying traditional Chinese grandeur, placing stone lions and dragon-phoenix patterns is easy to understand. The halberds at the corners, although they vividly display the martial spirit of China, the reason behind it might be known to few. In fact, the halberd, as a symbol of Chinese culture, is by no means inferior to stone lions and dragon-phoenix patterns. Moreover, it vividly reveals one of the important characteristics of Eastern body culture: "the extension of limbs and the ingenious use of various tools."

Nowhere in the world do theater and dance, like Chinese opera and folk dances, use props so skillfully. In opera, there are various weapons and props in martial arts dances; in dances, there are fans, handkerchiefs, and parasols; in acrobatics, there are various props for hand tricks and juggling. They are all present. No martial arts in any other place have weapons as colorful and diverse as Chinese martial arts. Apart from the eighteen traditional weapons, there are countless odd and unique weapons. They are not only weapons for defeating enemies but also props for expressing emotions and expanding one's aspirations in dance and exercise. They embody Eastern civilization and the brilliance and splendor of national cultural achievements.

Taking the halberd as an example, it is a long weapon that combines a spear and a dagger-axe. It has a long history, dating back to the Neolithic Age, where it was one of the four long weapons. During the chariot warfare of the Shang Dynasty, the halberd showed its might, capable of hooking, slashing, and stabbing, making it a powerful weapon. Its origins can be traced back to the time of the Yellow Emperor. Wei Wendi Cao Pi mentioned in "The Preface of Jian'an": "In the past, the Zhou and Lu treasured the Yonghu halberd, the Qulu spear, the Hufu dagger-axe, and the Xu family dagger. All these were famous weapons of ancient times. A gentleman, even with literary pursuits, must have military preparedness."

Cao Pi, who grew up in war and was well-versed in martial arts, naturally had his reasons for considering the halberd as the foremost ancient weapon. During the late Han and Jin dynasties, halberd techniques developed significantly. Apart from chariot and horseback warfare, there were also double halberds for infantry combat and throwing halberds for killing enemies at a distance. Cao Cao was a skilled user of double halberds. The "Records of Wei" in "Wu Di Ji" states: "Once, Cao Cao secretly entered the residence of Zhang Rang, a eunuch, intending to assassinate him. When discovered and surrounded, he danced with a halberd in the courtyard, leaped over the wall, and escaped, demonstrating his extraordinary martial skills."

During the Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties, halberds were rarely used on the battlefield, but as a weapon for dance and exercise, they were still very popular and developed many performance techniques. For example, the "Zizhi Tongjian" records: "Using a halberd to jump over obstacles, holding it in a circular motion, this is called the 'running halberd.'"

During the Tang Dynasty, the practice of arranging halberds in front of official residences according to rank was established, which can be considered the origin of the halberds in the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. During the Tang Dynasty, outbound processions also had colorful halberds leading the way. Some of these halberds were wooden and painted with colorful decorations. The traditional halberd techniques preserved in modern martial arts, such as the "Dragon Form," embody the meaning of the dragon soaring through the clouds and bringing rain. There are many scholarly insights in the techniques and rhymes.

    方天画戟的文化内涵
    峻骧
    影城好莱坞的“中国剧院”落成于1927年。60多年来接待了来自五大洲的千千万万艺术家、观光者，它门前蹲着一对石狮子，楼角装饰着方天画戟和龙凤浮雕。当年5月18日首映《王中之王》时，剧作家诺曼·塔尔梅奇无意踩在未干的水泥地上，留下了她的倩履芳踪。偶误成俗，在中国剧院门庭留手印足痕和签名，成为一种时髦，此后160位著名影星的手足印及签名，镶嵌在门前的水泥地上，使中国剧院成为好莱坞的圣地。
    显示中国传统气魄，摆放石狮和龙凤图案，容易理解，楼角的方天画戟，虽然鲜明地显示了神武的中国气概，但道理何在，恐怕知之者少。其实方天画戟，作为中国文化的象征，实在不比石狮、龙凤晚，而且它还鲜明地揭示了东方人体文化的重要的本体特征之一：
    “四肢的伸展与百体的妙用形成的器物表现性。”世界上没有一个地方的戏剧和舞蹈，像中国戏曲和民间舞蹈这样善于运用道具，戏曲战器舞中各种兵刃，舞蹈中的扇子、手帕和花伞，杂技的诸般手技杂耍的道具，真是应有尽有；任何地方的武术也没有中国武术中的兵器这样绚丽多彩。十八般兵器之外，还有各种奇兵异器，数不胜数。它们除了是制敌取胜的兵刃、抒情拓志舞练的道具外，更多的是体现着东方的文明，附丽着民族文化结晶的光辉和神彩。
    以戟为例，这是以矛为主、戈矛合体的一种长兵器，历史悠久，新石器时代四种长工兵器中就有了它，殷商车战时代，戟大显神威，既可勾割、啄击，又能直刺，杀伤力极强，其渊源可上溯黄帝时代。魏文帝曹丕在《建安诸序》中说：“昔周鲁宝雍狐之戟，屈卢之矛，狐父之戈，徐氏匕首。凡斯皆上世名器。君子虽有文事，必有武备矣。”
    在战争中长大、深谙武学的曹丕，以戟为上世名器之首，自然有其道理。汉末魏晋，戟术大为发展，除车战、马上使用的大戟外，又有步战可用的双戟、投掷杀敌的手戟等诸多品类，曹操就是舞双戟的能手。《魏志·武帝记》载：操曾私入当时中常侍张让住室，图谋刺张让，发觉被困捕，“乃舞手戟于庭，余垣而出，才武绝人，莫之能害。”
    戟在两晋南北朝时代，已经很少在战场上使用了，但作为舞练的兵器，却依然很发达，还发展为许多表演性技巧，如《通鉴·晋记》所记：“以戟矜于地，跳矜上，持谓环捷，此谓走戟也。”唐代出现列戟制度，官府宦宅门前，根据品级排列方天画戟，可谓好莱坞中国剧院列戟之源。唐时出行仪仗中也有彩戟为导，这些戟有的都是彩绘木制、饰以缨络。现代武术中保存的传统戟术，像龙形而取龙腾云布雨之意，其招法歌诀中，又有许多学问。　（上）
