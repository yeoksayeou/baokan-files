    As the year draws to a close, the capital's theater stages are bustling with activity. More than 30 performances from across the country have rung in the arrival of the 1990s with distinctive "opening acts."

    Among these performances, modern plays have emerged as a standout, drawing significant attention. The Shanxi Provincial Modern Drama Troupe, known for its "Yellow River Art," featuring "Two Women and One Man" by the Linfen Regional Mei Hu Opera Troupe, "Luo Suo Tears" by the Linyi County Mei Hu Opera Troupe, and "Wind Flowing Father and Son" by the Xiaoyi County Bowl Bowl Opera Troupe, has showcased the strong foundation and substantial progress of modern drama creation in Shanxi Province. The Tianjin Municipal Pingju Opera Troupe's "Village Willow," and the Yueyang City North District Flower Drum Opera Troupe's comedy "The Mayor Eats Rural Grain," are close to life and oriented towards the masses, with a fresh style and a strong earthy aroma. Some performances have seen full houses and thunderous applause, a rare sight in Beijing theaters in recent years.

    The three northeastern provinces have jointly presented six major performances in Beijing, bringing a strong "Northeast Wind" to the capital's theater scene. These six performances include "Young Zhou Enlai" (Harbin Children's Art Troupe), "Strong Wind and Sturdy Grass" (Benxi), "Noisy Summer" (Shenyang), "Moth" (Harbin), "Calamity" (Dalian), and "The Rich Woman" (Liaoning People's Art Troupe). Additionally, the Shandong Provincial Drama Troupe has also performed "Clothes of Confucius" in Beijing, bringing the image of the world cultural figure Confucius to the stage.

    岁末首都好戏连台
    现代戏格调清新深受欢迎
    本报讯　记者易凯报道：岁末，首都戏剧舞台呈现出一派繁忙景象，来自全国各地的30多台戏剧，为九十年代的到来敲响了别致的“开锣戏”。
    在这批剧目中，现代戏异军突起，引人注目。以“黄河艺术”著称，由临汾地区眉户剧团《两个女人和一个男人》、临猗县眉户剧团《唢呐泪》和孝义县碗碗腔剧团《风流父子》组成的山西省现代戏展演团，显示了山西省现代戏创作的坚强实力和长足的进步。天津市评剧团创演的《村南柳》，岳阳市北区花鼓戏剧团演出的喜剧《镇长吃的农村粮》，贴近生活，面向群众，格调清新，泥土之香扑面而来。有的戏演出，观众盈门，掌声雷动，为首都剧场近年所罕见。
    东三省联袂南下，在京演出六台大戏，在首都剧坛刮起一股强劲的“东北风”。这6台戏是《少年周恩来》（哈尔滨儿艺）、《疾风劲草》（本溪）、《喧闹的夏天》（沈阳）、《蛾》（哈尔滨）、《祸》（大连）和《富有的女人》（辽宁人艺）。此外，山东省话剧团也在京演出了《布衣孔子》，将世界文化名人孔子的形象搬上话剧舞台。
