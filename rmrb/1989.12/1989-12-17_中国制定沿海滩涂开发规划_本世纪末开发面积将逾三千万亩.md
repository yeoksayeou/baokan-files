China has formulated a comprehensive development plan for its coastal tidal flats. According to this plan, by the year 2000, the total area of developed coastal tidal flats will reach 30.4 million mu (approximately 2.03 million hectares).

Materials provided by the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that by the end of this century, most of China's coastal tidal flats will be developed and utilized.
