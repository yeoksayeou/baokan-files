Title: Foreigners Struggle to Find Housing in Tokyo

For foreigners, finding a place to live in Tokyo is quite difficult. Even if the high rent does not deter you, the indifference of Japanese landlords towards "old foreigners" will make you hesitate.

Trent Hill is an American video professional. He wanted to rent an apartment in Tokyo, but the Japanese landlord simply turned him away because he was a foreigner. "The landlord doesn't like dealing with 'old foreigners,'" Hill said.

Many foreigners complain that Japanese people do not pay much attention to them. When looking for a house in Tokyo, they often have to seek help from intermediaries, but the houses provided by these intermediaries are usually expensive and located in areas where foreigners congregate, which disappoints many foreigners who want to live among the Japanese.

The intermediary who helped Hill find a house admitted that he usually does not help foreigners find accommodations, but Hill was an exception because Hill could speak some Japanese. When asked about the reason, Hill said, "I once heard a Japanese landlord complain that foreigners do not follow the rules of residence, often cramming many people into one room, and that foreigners are much noisier than Japanese people."

Some Japanese landlords say they do not want to rent to customers who do not speak Japanese, but in reality, many foreigners who can speak Japanese still face cold attitudes from Japanese landlords.

In Japan, xenophobia is not limited to finding housing. Some taxi drivers, upon discovering that their passenger is a foreigner, will drive away. In some busy commercial areas, there are signs that say "No Foreigners Allowed" in front of bars.

Sakae, an intermediary specializing in introducing housing, said that he and his colleagues are helpless in this situation because, according to Japanese law, the rights of property owners are much greater than those of tenants. He also believes that the reason landlords (mostly older Japanese people) do not like foreigners may be related to the lingering hatred from World War II.

### “老外”东京找房难

    “老外”东京找房难
    对于外国人来说，要想在东京寻找栖身之处颇为困难。即使昂贵的房租未使你望而却步，那么，日本房主对“老外”们不理不睬的态度也会使你退避三舍。
    特伦特·希尔是美国一位录像专业人员。他想在东京租一间寓所，但日本房主仅仅因他是外国人便将其打发走了。“因为房主不喜欢同‘老外’打交道。”希尔说。
    许多外国人抱怨日本人对他们不爱理睬。他们在东京找房子不得不求助于中间人，但中间人能够提供的房子大都租金昂贵，且多在外国人集中的地方，后一点令许多想深入日本人中间生活的外国人颇感失望。
    那位帮希尔找房子的中间人承认，他不帮助外国人介绍住所，对希尔只是一个例外，因为希尔会说点日语。当问及个中原因时，希尔说：“我曾听到一位日本房主抱怨外国人不守居住规矩，常常在一间房子里挤上许多人，而且外国人比日本人要吵闹得多。”
    一些日本房主说他们不愿接待不会说日语的主顾，但实际上，对于许多会说日语的外国人来说，日本房主的面孔也是冷若冰霜。
    在日本，排外心理并非局限在找房一事上。一些出租汽车司机若发现乘客是个外国人，便会扬长而去。在有些闹市区的酒吧门前，挂有“外国人不得入内”的牌子。
    专门介绍住房的中间人坂本说，他和他的同行们对此无能为力，因为按照日本的法律，房产所有者比顾客的地位要有利得多。他还认为，房主（主要是些上了年纪的日本人）之所以不喜欢外国人，可能与他们至今仍存有二次大战遗留下来的仇恨心理不无关系。
