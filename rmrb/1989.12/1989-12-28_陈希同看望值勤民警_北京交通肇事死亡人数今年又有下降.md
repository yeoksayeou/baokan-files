"Your hard work is appreciated. On behalf of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation!" said Chen Xitong, a member of the State Council and the Mayor of Beijing, as he visited several street intersections in Beijing tonight to see the police officers on duty in the bitter cold. He praised their courage and dedication in ensuring the capital's traffic safety and reducing accidents, calling them "the people's most beloved."

It is understood that since 1986, the number of traffic fatalities in Beijing has decreased each year. As of December 26 this year, the number of fatalities has decreased by 110 compared to the same period last year, marking the fourth consecutive year of reduction. This achievement is the result of the collective efforts of all traffic police officers who have overcome difficulties and implemented target management. Vice Minister of Public Security Yu Lei also visited and expressed the intention to introduce Beijing's experience to the rest of the country.
