    Britain and Argentina to Resume Formal Flights Next Month
    Xinhua News Agency, London, December 27

    After agreements between relevant parties from Britain and Argentina, the air route between London and Buenos Aires, which has been suspended for eight years, will officially resume next month.

    According to a bilateral agreement signed by the two governments, each country's airline will operate two round trips per week between the two capitals.

    It is reported that the resumption of flights between the two countries was agreed upon during talks held in Madrid, Spain, in October this year.

    The air route between Britain and Argentina was suspended in 1981 following the outbreak of the Malvinas Islands War.
