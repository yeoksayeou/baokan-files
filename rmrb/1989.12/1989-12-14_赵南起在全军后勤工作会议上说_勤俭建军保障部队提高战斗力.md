	Central Military Commission member and Director of the General Logistics Department, Zhao Nanqi, urged all military personnel to work hard and build the military with frugality, continue to live a tight budget, and actively and effectively ensure the army's combat effectiveness.

	Zhao Nanqi said at the opening of the whole army logistics work conference today, "The Party and the state care deeply about military construction. The central leadership has clearly stated that economic construction and military construction must be coordinated, and the basic needs of the military should be covered by the state budget. However, in recent years, the state has been rectifying and adjusting the economy, and the central budget is quite tight, so military funding can only be gradually increased. He said that in 1990, the state budget for military funding has increased, showing great consideration for the military. However, compared to the minimum needs of military construction, there is still a significant gap. The military will still face a tight budget next year."

	Zhao Nanqi recalled that in 1989, despite the severe shortage of military funding, the whole army's logistics work focused on key areas, improved management, and increased revenue while cutting expenses, playing a crucial role in ensuring the army's combat effectiveness. However, it is also necessary to acknowledge that in many units, departments, and areas of work, there are widespread issues of waste and loss. As long as we strengthen management in all aspects, there is great potential for saving and increasing revenue, and the tight budget can be managed.

	He demanded that all logistics personnel in the military must fully understand China's national conditions and military situation, truly understand why we need to live a tight budget and how to do so. They must turn the idea of living a tight budget into actual actions and transform it into a driving force for all logistics work, making the limited military funding yield greater benefits and striving to ensure the army's combat effectiveness.

	Zhao Nanqi proposed that the military logistics front should focus on five key areas next year: first, allocate and use military funding to prioritize key areas, providing appropriate support to division-level and below units and equipment construction; second, rectify and develop production and business operations to enhance the ability to supplement both materials and funds; third, deepen logistics reforms to improve work efficiency and the effectiveness of fund and material use; fourth, strictly enforce regulations and promote frugality and thrift; fifth, strengthen logistics preparedness, training, and scientific work to improve rapid support capabilities.

	Zhao Nanqi particularly emphasized several prohibitions for next year: prohibiting the construction of new buildings, prohibiting government agencies and public institutions from purchasing high-end equipment, prohibiting the establishment of "little treasuries," prohibiting the purchase of vehicles beyond the approved number and standards; prohibiting banquets paid for with public funds, prohibiting travel paid for with public funds, prohibiting gifts paid for with public funds, prohibiting the excessive issuance of living allowances and awards, souvenirs, and prohibiting the construction and occupation of housing beyond standards, and prohibiting the misappropriation and withholding of various funds and materials.

    赵南起在全军后勤工作会议上说
    勤俭建军保障部队提高战斗力
    本报北京12月13日电  新华社记者郭殿成、本报记者罗同松报道：中央军委委员、总后勤部部长赵南起要求全军指战员艰苦奋斗，勤俭建军，继续过好紧日子，积极有效地保障部队提高战斗力。
    赵南起在今天开幕的全军后勤工作会议上说，党和国家对军队建设很关怀，中央领导明确提出经济建设和军队建设要统筹兼顾，军队的基本需求应由国家财政包下来。但是，最近几年国家正在治理整顿经济，中央财政比较困难，军费只能逐年增加，逐步解决。他说，1990年国家对军费的拨款有增加，对军队给予了很大照顾。但是，同军队建设的最低需要相比，还相差很大，明年全军的日子仍是很紧的。
    赵南起回顾说，1989年全军后勤工作在军费严重不足的情况下，突出重点，改进管理，开源节流，对保障部队提高战斗力发挥了应有作用，同时也要看到，在许多单位、许多部门、许多工作中，损失浪费现象比较普遍。只要我们切实加强各方面的管理，节支增收的潜力很大，紧日子是过得去的。
    他要求全军后勤指战员，一定要充分认识我国的国情、军情，真正弄清楚为什么要过紧日子，怎样过紧日子。要把过紧日子的思想变成实际行动，转化为推动后勤各项工作的动力，使有限的军费发挥更大的效益，努力保障部队提高战斗力。
    赵南起提出全军后勤战线明年要着重抓好五项工作：一、军费分配使用要突出重点，实行对建制团以下部队和装备建设的适度倾斜；二、整顿和发展生产经营，增强实物和经费两个方面的补助能力；三、深化后勤改革，提高工作效率和经费物资使用效益；四、严格规章制度，厉行勤俭节约；五、加强后勤战备、训练和科技工作，提高快速保障能力。
    赵南起特别强调了明年的几个禁止，即禁止建设新的楼堂馆所，禁止机关和事业单位购置高档设备，禁止设立“小金库”，禁止超编制、超标准购买车辆；禁止用公款宴请，禁止用公款旅游，禁止用公款送礼，禁止滥发生活补贴和奖品、纪念品，禁止超标准建房、住房，禁止挪用、克扣各项经费和物资。
