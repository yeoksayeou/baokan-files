Suggestions for Reforming Travel Allowance Regulations

Recently, I have noticed a peculiar phenomenon: some individuals on business trips, who clearly did not stay in hotels, purchase dozens or even hundreds of yuan worth of accommodation receipts. I learned that in Beijing, a hotel that can only accommodate 60 people, almost every day has people coming to buy accommodation vouchers. These people can thus make tens of thousands of yuan annually. I have also observed similar situations in Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places.

I once asked a person involved, and he laughed, saying, “What can I do? Without an accommodation receipt, I won’t get the allowance. Who cares, it’s public money anyway.” After some investigation, I found out that the finance department has a regulation that the amount of travel allowance received is based on the accommodation receipts. Therefore, some people who could have stayed with relatives still have to book a bed in a hotel just to get the allowance. This way, how much money does the country end up wasting!

I believe that in the current situation, some inappropriate and inaccurate regulations should be changed. Not providing travel allowances places a heavy burden on individuals, but for the sake of getting the allowance, it is not good for the country and the collective to suffer such losses. Now, some units implement a lump-sum or fixed travel allowance, which I think is a good method. For example, a certain state-owned unit adopts the lump-sum method: for a trip, the number of days needed and the total amount of compensation are determined in advance. Any savings belong to the individual, while any overspending is paid by the individual. This effectively prevents the bad practice of spending public money to get allowances and promotes a thrifty and simple style. Of course, this method may not be perfect. I suggest that the relevant departments come up with more thorough and accurate methods.

### 建议改革出差补助规定

    建议改革出差补助规定
    近来我发现一种怪现象，一些出差人员，明明没住旅馆，却拿几十元、上百元去买住宿发票。我了解到，北京一个仅容60人的旅馆，几乎每天都有人来买住宿票，这些人每年可因此白得3万多元。我在广州、汕头等地也发现同样的情况。
    我曾问一位当事人，他笑着说：“没办法，没住宿发票回去不给补助。管他呢，反正是公家的钱。”后经我打听才知道，财务有规定，领取出差补助是以住宿发票为准。这样，有些出差人本可以住在亲属家，却还要在旅社里包个床位，为的是回去拿补助。如此算来国家该白花多少钱啊！
    我认为，在目前情况下，一些不合适、不准确的规定该改一改。出差不给补助，个人的确负担过重，但为拿补助，让国家和集体太吃亏也不行。现在有的单位实行差旅费包干或定量补助，我看是个好办法。如某国营单位采取的包干法：一趟差需多少天，共补多少钱，节约归己，超支自付。有效地防止了为领补助慷国家之慨的坏风气，也提倡了勤俭简朴的作风。当然这一办法不一定完美无缺。建议有关部门能想出更周密、准确的办法。
