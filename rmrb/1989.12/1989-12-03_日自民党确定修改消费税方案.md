Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party finally decided on a revised plan for the consumption tax this evening.

The consumption tax is a large indirect tax. The new tax, which came into effect on April 1 of this year, stipulates that almost all priced consumption, including childbirth and cremation, requires a 3% consumption tax to be paid to the state.

The state can increase its revenue by 600 billion yen annually through this new tax.

Because this tax system not only increases the economic burden on wholesalers and consumers at various levels but also adds procedural inconveniences, it has caused widespread dissatisfaction. The first reason for the LDP's defeat in the July House of Councillors election was this.

The main contents of the LDP's revised plan include: no consumption tax will be levied on the retail stage of all food, and a 1.5% consumption tax will be levied on the production and circulation stages. In addition, childbirth, cremation, burial, school enrollment, purchase of textbooks, use of elderly welfare facilities, and rent will all be exempt from consumption tax. This plan will be implemented from October 1 next year.

    日自民党确定修改消费税方案
    新华社东京12月1日电  （记者王大军）日本执政的自民党今晚终于确定了修改消费税方案。
    消费税是一种大型间接税。今年4月1日起正式付诸实施的这一新税规定，几乎所有有价消费，包括生小孩和死人火化，都要向国家交纳3％的消费税。
    国家靠此新税，每年可增加6万亿日元的收入。
    由于这一税制不但增加了各层批发商和消费者的经济负担，还从手续上给他们添了麻烦，所以引起普遍不满。自民党在7月的参议院选举中失利，这是第一条原因。
    自民党的修改方案主要内容包括，所有食品零售阶段不征收消费税，在生产、流通阶段改征1.5％的消费税。另外，分娩、火化、埋葬、入学、购教科书、老人利用福利设施、房费等都免征消费税等。这一方案将从明年10月1日实施。
