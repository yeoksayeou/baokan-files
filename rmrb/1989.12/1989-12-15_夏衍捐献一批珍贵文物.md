Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th.

The 90-year-old renowned writer Xia Yan jokingly referred to himself as "taking care of his own affairs." After donating the precious cultural relic "A Handwritten Scroll of Poems by Qing Dynasty Poet Nalan Xingde" to the Shanghai Museum, he recently donated all his cherished collection of Chinese calligraphy and painting treasures to the Zhejiang Provincial Museum.

In the bright and warm study-cum-bedroom, Xia Yan meticulously counted these "family treasures" and the stories behind their collection for the reporter: 33 pieces of exquisite works by the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, 25 works by Qi Baishi, masterpieces by Lan Ying, Wang Shimin, Wu Changshuo, Ren Bonian, and Huang Binhong, landscape paintings by the translator Lin Qinnan, the "Mok Chuk" by the Qing Dynasty painter Min Zheng, which was bought from a street stall, and calligraphy by Guo Moruo and Tian Han, which evoked the old man's memories of past years...

In 1955, Xia Yan was transferred from Shanghai to become the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and since then, he joined the ranks of Beijing's cultural figures who frequented Liulichang. He said, "I like freehand paintings, so I often stole time from my busy schedule to go to Liulichang with Deng Tuo, Tian Jiaying, A Ying, and Xu Pingyu. Tian Jiaying only collected calligraphy works, Xu Pingyu collected works by the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, and I mainly collected works by the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou and Qi Baishi. At that time, my family's financial burden was light, and I also had manuscript fees and royalties... Unfortunately, during the 'Cultural Revolution,' the Red Guards ransacked my home, and some cultural relics were lost."

Xia Yan's donated works are extremely valuable for the study of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, Qi Baishi, and even the history of Chinese art.

    夏衍捐献一批珍贵文物
    新华社北京12月14日电  （记者邵建武）90高龄的著名作家夏衍笑称，他在料理自己的“后事”——继向上海博物馆捐赠珍贵文物《清代词人纳兰性德诗翰手卷》后，近日又把自己苦心收藏的全部中国书画珍品献给浙江省博物馆。
    在明亮温暖的书房兼卧室里，夏衍向记者细细地数点着这些“家珍”和收藏它们的故事：33件扬州八怪的精品，齐白石的25件作品，蓝瑛、王翚、吴昌硕、任伯年、黄宾虹的力作，翻译家林琴南的山水画，清代画家闵贞的《墨竹》是从地摊上买的，郭沫若和田汉的书法则唤起老人对过往岁月的回忆……
    1955年，夏衍从上海调任文化部副部长，从此，他加入北京文化人“跑琉璃厂”的行列。他说，“我欢喜写意画，所以，常常忙里偷闲，和邓拓、田家英、阿英、徐平羽一起，到琉璃厂去。田家英只收藏书法作品，徐平羽收藏八大山人一派，我主要收藏扬州八怪和齐白石的作品。当时，我的家庭负担轻，又有稿费、版税收入……可惜的是，‘文化大革命’红卫兵抄家，流失了一些文物。”
    夏衍捐赠的作品，对于研究扬州八怪、齐白石、乃至中国美术史都是极为珍贵的资料。
