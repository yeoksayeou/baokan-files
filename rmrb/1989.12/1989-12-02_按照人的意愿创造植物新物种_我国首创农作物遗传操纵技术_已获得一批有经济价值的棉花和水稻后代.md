Manipulating plant genetics using biotechnology to create new plant species according to human will for the benefit of humanity—this great dream of mankind is becoming a reality in China.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Economic Crops, and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Crop Breeding and Cultivation have collaborated since 1978. After 11 years of arduous exploration, they have pioneered a new technology for crop genetic manipulation—"biotechnology breeding technique of introducing exogenous DNA into plants after pollination." DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the biological macromolecule that carries genetic information. While repeatedly conducting experiments, they have used this new technology to breed new crop species, successfully producing economically valuable offspring in cotton and rice. Among these, the new cotton variety 3118, which combines the disease resistance of the donor plant (the plant providing the exogenous DNA) sea island cotton and the high yield characteristics of the recipient plant (the plant receiving the exogenous DNA) upland cotton, has shown stable inheritance for 9 generations. Its yield is 20% to 70% higher than that of the recipient cotton. It has been expanded to 12,000 mu (approximately 800 hectares) of planting area, with an average yield increase of more than 15%. The new rice variety 829042, developed by introducing the DNA of early-maturing purple corn into rice, has excellent characteristics such as early maturity and drought resistance. It is currently being expanded for trials in dry fields on the outskirts of Beijing. In rice, exogenous DNA from barnyard grass, sorghum, and purple rice has also been introduced, resulting in offspring with unique variations or specific traits of the donor plants.

This new molecular breeding technology pioneered by Chinese scientists has attracted the attention of the international scientific community.

Experts here point out that the birth of the "biotechnology breeding technique of introducing exogenous DNA into plants after pollination" not only provides a good experimental system for studying the introduction of exogenous DNA into plants but also offers a new technology for expanding the variation range of plants. In agricultural breeding, this is a new pathway with application value. This new technology has several advantages, including simplicity, low equipment requirements, and ease of use for general breeders.

    按照人的意愿创造植物新物种
    我国首创农作物遗传操纵技术
    已获得一批有经济价值的棉花和水稻后代
    据新华社上海12月1日电  （记者陆国元）运用生物工程技术操纵植物遗传，按照人的意愿创造植物新物种为人类造福——人类的这一伟大梦想正在中国成为现实。
    中国科学院上海生物化学研究所与江苏省农业科学院经济作物研究所、中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所通力合作，从1978年开始，经过11年的艰难探索，在国际上首创“农作物遗传操纵新技术——授粉后外源DNA导入植物的生物工程育种技术”。DNA即携带遗传信息的生物大分子脱氧核糖核酸。在不断重复试验的同时，运用这一新技术进行农作物新物种选育，在棉花和水稻中都已获得一批具有经济价值的后代。其中，兼有供体（即提供外源DNA的植物）海岛棉抗病性和受体（即接受外源DNA的植物）陆地棉高产特征的棉花新品种3118，稳定遗传已达9代，产量比受体棉增产20％至70％；扩大种植12000亩，普遍增产15％以上。将早熟紫玉米的DNA导入水稻而培育出来的水稻新品种829042，具有早熟、耐旱等优异特性，目前正在北京市郊的旱田里扩大试种。在水稻中分别导入稗草、高粱、紫稻等外源DNA，都已获得具有变异特殊的类型或具有供体植物特异性状的子代。
    中国科学家首创的这一分子育种新技术，已引起了国际科学界的瞩目。
    此间专家指出，“授粉后外源DNA导入植物的生物工程育种技术”的诞生，不仅为研究外源DNA导入植物提供了一个良好的实验系统，而且为扩大植物的变异范围提供了一项新的技术。在农业育种上，这是一个有应用价值的新途径。这一新技术具有方法简便、设备条件要求不复杂、可为一般育种工作者掌握等一系列优点。
