Retired soldiers Ning Xuanmin and Han Tongsheng from Nan Zhuang Village, Bayu Township, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, after becoming village officials, held their first meeting to discuss education. The first practical thing they did was to build a thousand-square-meter standard classroom building, which was one of the best in the county.

In recent years, most villagers in Nan Zhuang have become prosperous, and some have even started to enjoy a relatively comfortable life ahead of schedule. Some wealthy households spend thousands of yuan on red and white ceremonies. But what about Nan Zhuang Primary School? Due to long-term neglect and dilapidation, the buildings were in danger of collapsing at any time. In 1984, the village demolished all the school classrooms to prepare for the construction of a new school. Later, due to various reasons, the construction did not start, and more than 400 students had to "fight guerrilla warfare" and study outdoors. Winter came and went, and in the blink of an eye, four or five years had passed, but not a single classroom had been built.

Last winter, the leadership of Nan Zhuang Village was reorganized. Ning Xuanmin and Han Tongsheng, two retired soldiers, were elected by the villagers as the village party secretary and village head. Among the eight members of the new leadership, five had served in the military. As soon as Ning Xuanmin and Han Tongsheng took office, they went to the school to visit the teachers and students. As soon as they entered the school gate, what caught the eye of the two "leaders" was: hundreds of students kneeling in the snow to write. Seeing this scene, Ning Xuanmin, known as the "iron man," shed tears. Without saying a word, he immediately called for a meeting of the "two committees" to discuss education. At the meeting, he said with tears in his eyes:

"Look at what we eat and wear, and then look at the environment in which the teachers and students of the school study. How can we, as cadres, sit still?" After repeated discussions, it was decided to build a high-standard, high-specification standard classroom building. The state had no money, so the people were mobilized to raise funds to build the school. Ning Xuanmin and Han Tongsheng donated 320 yuan and 450 yuan respectively, and Deputy Village Head Wang Zhenyi also donated 450 yuan. Other cadres donated 100 to 200 yuan each. Led by the cadres, more than 190 households in the village donated money and materials. The wealthy household Wang Fuguang donated 2,500 yuan at one time. In less than a month, the village raised 124,000 yuan for school construction, and the value of the materials donated by the villagers was more than 10,000 yuan.

During the more than ten months of school construction, Ning Xuanmin, Han Tongsheng, and other village cadres were always on the front line of the construction site. Due to overwork, Ning Xuanmin had five heart attacks, received intravenous drips, and as soon as he recovered a bit, he appeared on the construction site again; Deputy Village Head Wang Zhenyi's wife had prepared watermelon seeds worth 300 to 400 yuan, waiting for him to come back and plant, but she waited and waited and did not see his shadow, and she could only watch as the watermelon seeds were thrown away; retired soldier and Deputy Village Head Zhao Chunji was in charge of transporting timber. To save hundreds of yuan in transportation fees, he and four or five villagers loaded the timber onto the car one by one.

On November 28, Nan Zhuang Village held a completion ceremony for the classroom building at the primary school. The men, women, and children of the village dressed in their festive best and rushed to the school. The teachers and students sang and danced to celebrate this happy day. School principal Xia Qiu said excitedly: "The village has built such a good classroom building for us. If we cannot teach the children well, we will not be able to account to the parents and fellow villagers."

    走马上任头件事
    张民强　袁建新　李洪元
    陕西省大荔县八鱼乡南庄村退伍军人宁选民、韩同生等，当上村里的干部后，开的第一次会议研究的是办学，办的第一件实事就是建起了一幢全县数一数二的、一千多平方米的正规教学楼。
    这几年，南庄村大多数村民都脱贫致富了，有的还提前过上了小康生活。有些富裕户过红白喜事，一花就是好几千元。可南庄小学呢？由于年久失修，房屋危漏，随时都有倒塌的可能。一九八四年村上就拆除了学校的全部教室，准备建新校。后来，由于种种原因，始终没有动工，四百多名学生只好“打游击”，在露天地上课。冬去春来，一晃四五年过去了，一间教室还没有建起。
    去年冬季，南庄村的领导班子进行了改组。宁选民、韩同生两位退伍兵被群众选为支书、村长。在新的领导班子八名成员中，就有五人当过兵。宁选民、韩同生刚上任，就跑到学校看望师生，一进校门，映入二位“当家人”眼帘的是：几百名学生跪在雪地上写字。看到这一幕，人称“铁汉子”的宁选民掉泪了，他二话没说，马上召集“两委会”一班人召开会议研究办学。会上，他声泪俱下地说：
  “看看咱们吃的、穿的，再看看学校的老师、学生上课、学习的环境，咱作为干部咋能坐得住”。经过大家反复协商，决定建造一幢高水平、高规格的正规教学楼。国家没钱，发动群众集资建校。宁选民、韩同生首先捐献了三百二十元和四百五十元，副村长王振义也捐献了四百五十元。其它干部分别捐献了一二百元。在干部们的带动下，全村一百九十多户村民纷纷捐钱捐物，富裕户王福刚一次就捐献了二千五百元。不到一个月时间村上就集资建校款十二万四千多元，村民捐献的实物价值一万多元。
    在建校的十个多月里，宁选民、韩同生等村干部一直奋战在工地。因劳累过度宁选民的心脏病突发五次，打过吊针，稍有好转他又出现在工地上；副村长王振义爱人把价值三四百元的西瓜种子都烫好了，只等他回来下种，可左等右等也不见人影，眼睁睁地看着把瓜种倒掉；退伍军人、副村长赵春计负责拉运木料，为了省掉几百元的装运费，他和四、五名村民一起，一根一根地把十几方木料装上了车。
    十一月二十八日，南庄村在小学举行了教学楼落成典礼大会。村上的男女老少身着节日盛装，涌向小学，师生们载歌载舞欢庆这美好的一天。学校校长夏秋忙激动地说：“村上给咱建造这么好的教学楼，教不好娃娃，咱无法向父老乡亲交帐。”
