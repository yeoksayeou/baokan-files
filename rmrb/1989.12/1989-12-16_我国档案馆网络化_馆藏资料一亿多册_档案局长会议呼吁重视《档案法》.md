Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Chen Yan and Su Ning reported from Beijing on December 15th: At the opening of the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal archives bureau chiefs' meeting held in Beijing today, it was learned that China's archives have basically formed a network. There are 3,350 archives of various levels and types, storing over 100 million volumes of archives and materials.

State Archives Bureau Director Feng Zizhi pointed out at the meeting today that although China's archives have developed rapidly, due to limited conditions, among the 83.08 million volumes of archives preserved in comprehensive archives at all levels nationwide, 12 million volumes have been damaged, moldy, or eaten by insects and rats, urgently needing rescue. A batch of key archives, including instructions from the Central Committee of the Party and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De to the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, have 30% of their characters blurred, yellowed, and brittle paper, with some already stuck together like bricks. Feng Zizhi called for the whole society to pay attention to the implementation of the Archives Law. It is reported that the General Office of the State Council recently forwarded the State Archives Bureau's report on further strengthening the construction of the archives cause, requiring governments at all levels to seriously implement the Archives Law.

    我国档案馆网络化
    馆藏资料一亿多册
    档案局长会议呼吁重视《档案法》
    本报北京12月15日讯新华社记者陈雁、本报记者苏宁报道：记者从今天在京开幕的省、自治区、直辖市档案局长会上获悉：我国的档案馆已基本形成网络，各级各类档案馆达到3350个，馆藏档案、资料已达一亿多卷册。
    国家档案局局长冯子直今天在会上指出，虽然，我国档案馆发展迅速，但是由于条件所限，全国各级综合档案馆保存的8308万卷档案中，有1200万卷档案已破损、霉烂或被虫蛀、鼠咬，亟需抢救。一批党中央及毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德等老一辈无产阶级革命家对陕甘宁边区的指示等内容的重点档案，已有30％的字迹模糊、纸张发黄变脆，有的已粘结成砖。冯子直呼吁，全社会要重视《档案法》的实施。据悉，国务院办公厅最近转发国家档案局关于进一步加强档案事业建设的报告，要求各级人民政府认真实施《档案法》。
