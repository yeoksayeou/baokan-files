People's Daily, Taiyuan, December 13th

After the National Day holiday, leaders from the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government went deep into enterprises to conduct investigations and on-site offices, helping to address concerns and resolve difficulties, promoting stable production development. From January to the end of October, the city's total industrial output value increased by 10.1% compared to the same period last year, and fiscal revenue increased by 19.5% compared to the same period last year.

Taiyuan's industrial enterprises, with a main structure of heavy industries such as metallurgy, coal, and chemical engineering, have faced increasing difficulties in electricity, transportation, raw materials, and funds since the second quarter of this year. Facing this severe situation, the leaders of several leading bodies in the city formed five working groups to conduct investigations and research in more than 30 enterprises. Taiyuan Steel's production once declined this year. Faced with difficulties, they relied on strong ideological and political work, advocating for looking inward and overcoming difficulties. In October, the company's main products, such as steel, steel materials, and pig iron, all exceeded the company's struggle targets. The total industrial output value reached 150 million yuan, and the realization of profits and taxes and the payment of profits and taxes were also better than the same period last year. Municipal Party Secretary Sun Ying, during the on-site office, fully affirmed the measures taken by Taiyuan Steel to overcome difficulties and proposed suggestions for further strengthening ideological and political work.

Several leaders of the Municipal Government, during on-site offices at Jiangyang Chemical Factory, Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Factory, and Taiyuan Bus Factory, proposed, in response to the main problems currently existing, to implement "product chain" management for the city's industrial system. This means connecting the products produced in Taiyuan into a "chain" according to the production sequence, organizing large-scale cooperation within the city. Products listed in the "product chain" will have their purchases and sales organized and coordinated by relevant municipal departments, and plans will be issued based on production and demand quantities, with sales implemented at factory prices. This way, transportation and intermediate links can be reduced, product costs can be lowered, and enterprises can improve product quality. The Municipal Government has made a temporary regulation to expand "product chain" management in the city's industrial system, which has been implemented in more than 50 types of products and has shown initial results.

During the investigation of enterprises, the Municipal Government leaders also actively advocated for "industry-commerce joint sales," organizing enterprises to participate in market sales, or adopting factory-store joint sales of products to overcome the adverse factors brought by market stagnation.

    领导下基层排忧　企业靠协作取胜
    太原工业迎难而上求发展
    本报太原电　记者王艾生报道：国庆节过后，太原市委、市政府领导干部，深入企业调查研究，现场办公，帮助排忧解难，促进生产稳步发展，1至10月底，全市工业总产值比去年同期增长10.1％，财政收入比去年同期增长19.5％。
    以冶金、煤炭、化工等重型结构为主体的太原市工业企业，今年二季度以来，电力、运输、原材料和资金紧缺的困难日益突出。面对严峻局面，该市几个领导班子的负责同志，组成5个工作组，深入30多家企业调查研究。太钢今年生产曾一度下滑。在困难面前，他们依靠强有力的思想政治工作，提倡眼睛向内，迎难而上。10月份，这个公司的主要产品钢、钢材、生铁等产量都超过公司的奋斗目标，工业总产值达1.5亿元，实现利税和上缴利税也都好于去年同期。市委书记孙英在现场办公中，充分肯定了太钢为克服困难所采取的措施，并对进一步加强思想政治工作提出了意见。
    市政府几位领导在江阳化工厂、山西汽车制造厂、太原客车厂等企业现场办公时，针对当前存在的主要问题，提出对全市工业系统实行“产品链”管理，即把太原市生产的产品，按生产序列串连起来成为“链”，组织市内的大联合、大协作。列入“产品链”的产品，其购销由市有关部门组织协作衔接，并根据产量、需求量平衡下达计划，销售实行厂价。这样，可减少运力和中间环节，降低产品成本，促进企业提高产品质量。市政府作出在全市工业系统扩大“产品链”管理的暂行规定，已经在50余种产品中实行“产品链”，初见成效。
    市政府领导在企业调查中，还积极倡导产品的“工商联销”，组织企业参与市场销售，或采取厂店联合推销产品等办法，克服市场疲软带来的不利因素。
