Kalamkari is a traditional handicraft from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is a technique of painting with a pen called a "kalam" and then printing the design onto fabric. The term Kalamkari literally translates to "pen work."

The coastal town of Masulipatam (an important port in the 17th century) and the Sri Kalahasti region have long been centers for this beautiful handicraft. The printed fabrics from Masulipatam were once exported in large quantities to Europe. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, Western demand for Kalamkari plummeted, and instead, Iran became the primary market for Kalamkari bedspreads, bedsheets, tapestries, and curtains.

The kalam used to create Kalamkari is made from a short bamboo or palm stick. One end of the stick is sharpened into a pen tip, and a tuft of fibers is attached to the tip to absorb the dye. The primary colors used in Kalamkari are brick red, indigo blue, and a light brownish-yellow. Secondary colors like green, orange, and purple are created by mixing these primary colors. The outlines are always in black.

In India, the exquisite Kalamkari patterns on saris and fabrics are widely recognized. Kalamkari designs include motifs of the golden shower tree, animal shapes, paisley swirls, and more. The Kalamkari produced in Sri Kalahasti primarily features narrative-style tapestries depicting mythological figures from epics (see left image). However, over the years, as customer demands have changed, the patterns and motifs of Kalamkari have also evolved.

    卡拉姆卡里
    卡拉姆卡里是印度安得拉邦的传统手工艺品。它用卡拉姆（意思是笔）绘画并将画印在织物上。卡拉姆卡里可直译为“用笔工作”。
    沿海的马苏里帕塔姆镇（十七世纪的一个重要港口）和斯里卡拉哈斯蒂地区，自古以来就是这种美丽手工艺品的中心。马苏里帕塔姆出产的印花布，曾经向欧洲大量出口。随着工业革命的降临，西方对卡拉姆卡里的需求量一落千丈，反而伊朗成了卡拉姆卡里拜垫、床单、壁毯和窗帘的主要市场。
    绘制卡拉姆卡里用的卡拉姆，是用一根短的竹条或椰枣树木条制成的。短条的一头削成笔尖状，尖端之上是一个毛团，用来蘸吸染料。卡拉姆卡里的主要颜色有砖红色、靛蓝色和浅暗桔黄色。而绿色、橙色和紫色等二次色则由这些主要颜色混合而成。轮廓线总是黑色的。
    在印度，莎丽服和衣料上优美的卡拉姆卡里图案几乎是人人熟知的。卡拉姆卡里的花纹图案包括金钟柏树、动物的外形、佩斯利涡旋花纹等。斯里卡拉哈斯蒂出产的卡拉姆卡里主要是叙事风格的壁毯，展现出史诗中的神话人物（见左图）。但是历年来随着顾客要求的变化，卡拉姆卡里的花纹图案也在不断演变。（附图片）
