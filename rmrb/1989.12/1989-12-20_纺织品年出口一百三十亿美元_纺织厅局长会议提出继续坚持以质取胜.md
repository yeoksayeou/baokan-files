	Textile exports have reached $13 billion annually. The Ministry of Textile Industry held a meeting of bureau chiefs, emphasizing the continued pursuit of quality.

	According to a report by our reporter Li Xie, China has become a major textile-producing country. Over 8 million textile workers have overcome difficulties such as shortages of raw materials, funds, foreign exchange, energy, and market sales obstacles this year, maintaining a certain growth rate in production. It is expected that the total industrial output value for the year will reach 130 billion yuan, a 3% increase over the same period last year. According to customs statistics, it is estimated that the annual exports of textiles and garments will reach $13 billion, a 10% increase over last year.

	At the national textile industry bureau chiefs' meeting held on the 19th, Minister of Textile Industry Wu Wenying said that next year's domestic textile sales will be relatively stable. Various regions should seize this opportunity to expand exports while ensuring the domestic market, striving to increase foreign exchange earnings for the country. The export of textiles should continue to adhere to the policy of quality first, and efforts should be made to increase the export of final products such as garments, knitted fabrics, and decorative fabrics. At the same time, the export of two yarns and two fabrics should not be easily reduced, and markets that have been captured should not be easily withdrawn from.

    纺织品年出口一百三十亿美元
    纺织厅局长会议提出继续坚持以质取胜
    本报讯　记者李茜报道：我国已成为世界纺织品生产大国，800多万纺织职工今年克服原料、资金、外汇、能源不足，市场销售不畅等困难，使生产保持了一定增长速度，预计全年可完成工业总产值1300亿元，比去年同期增长3％；据海关统计，预计全年纺织品和服装出口可达130亿美元，比去年增长10％。
    纺织部长吴文英在19日召开的全国纺织工业厅局长会议上说，明年国内纺织品销售比较平稳，各地要抓住这个有利时机，在安排好国内市场的同时，千方百计扩大出口，为国家增加外汇收入。纺织品出口要继续坚持以质取胜的方针，并努力增加服装、针织品和装饰布等最终产品的出口，同时也不轻易减少两纱两布的出口，对已经占领的市场不能轻易退出。
