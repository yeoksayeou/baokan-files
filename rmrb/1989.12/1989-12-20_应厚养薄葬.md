Editor's Note:

We should honor the living with generosity and bury the dead with simplicity. After experiencing the aspirations of youth and the dedication of middle age, everyone enters the autumn of life—old age. How we treat the elderly, both during their lifetime and after their death, reflects the level of civilization of an individual, a family, and even an entire nation. Our Chinese nation has a tradition of respecting the elderly. Today, we should carry forward this tradition, and the best way to honor the elderly is to provide them with generous care during their lifetime and simple burials after their death.

The elderly have dedicated their lives to the development of society and the upbringing of their descendants. They deserve respect from society and filial piety from their children, so that they can maintain a happy mind and body, and live out their later years in peace until their passing.

Many people agree that it is better to honor the living with generosity than to bury the dead with extravagance. This is also the wish of the elderly. However, some people do not share this view. They believe that only by burying the dead with extravagance can they show filial piety. Some people even mistreat the elderly during their lifetime but then hold grand funerals for them, "laying gold and silver" and inviting many guests. This is completely wrong.

Once a person dies, their soul no longer exists. "Heavy coffins and elaborate burial chambers, grand banquets for guests," are all done for the living, and have nothing to do with the deceased.

When commemorating the elderly, it is better to be frugal than extravagant. As long as it can express our sorrow, it is sufficient. We must not bury them with heavy coffins and waste money.

The Party and the government have always advocated for civilized and frugal funerals, promoting cremation in areas where conditions allow, and eliminating earth burials because cremation is frugal, hygienic, and scientific, and is the most civilized way to handle funerals. In areas where cremation is not possible, efforts should be made to reform earth burials to save land. This is a great cause that benefits the country and the people, and brings blessings to future generations.

To promote funeral reforms and achieve the goal of honoring the living with generosity and burying the dead with simplicity, it depends on the practice of each of us, especially the exemplary role of Party members and cadres. Changing customs is not easy, and changing habits is even harder. We believe that as long as we persist, our country will definitely be able to form a social custom of honoring the living with generosity and burying the dead with simplicity.

    应厚养薄葬
    每个人在经历了青年的憧憬、中年的奉献之后，便进入人生之秋——老年。如何对待生前和死后的老年人，反映出一个人、一个家庭，乃至一个民族的文明程度。我们中华民族具有尊老传统，今天我们应发扬这个传统，孝敬老人的最好方式就是厚养薄葬。
    老年人为社会发展、扶养后代操劳一生，理应得到社会的尊重，子女的孝敬，使他们保持身心愉快，安度晚年，直到谢世。
    死后厚葬，不如生前厚养。这是许多人的共同认识，也是老年人的心愿。但是，有人却不是这样。他们以为只有厚葬才算孝敬老人，有的人甚至在老人生前对老人百般虐待，死后却为老人“铺金盖银”，大办丧事。这样做，实在大谬不然。
    人一死灵魂便不复存在。“重棺厚椁，大宴宾客”，其实是做给活人看的，与故者又有何干系？
    追悼老人，宁俭勿奢，只要能寄托哀思即可，切不可重殓厚葬，浪费钱财。
    党和政府一贯主张文明节俭办丧事，提倡在有条件的地区积极推行火葬，杜绝土葬，因为火葬节俭、卫生、科学，是最文明的丧葬方式；在不具备火葬条件的地区进行节约土地的土葬改革。这是利国利民，造福子孙的大事。
    推进殡葬改革，实现厚养薄葬，有赖于我们每个人的躬行实践，尤其是党员、干部的模范作用。移风不易，易俗尤难。我们相信，只要持之以恒，我国就一定能形成厚养薄葬的社会风尚。
