Is it the Exercise of "Self-Defense" or Hegemony?

Newspaper reporter Xiao Fangqiong

The U.S. representative at the emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council defended the U.S. military invasion of Panama, claiming that the U.S. sent troops in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter to exercise "self-defense." However, people cannot help but ask: Is a superpower sending troops to invade a small country far away from the U.S. with only over two million people exercising self-defense or practicing hegemony?

Article 51 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that any member state of the United Nations, when subjected to armed attack, has the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense. The basis for the U.S. military's "self-defense" in Panama is that on December 16th, an American officer was killed in a conflict with Panamanians on Panamanian soil. The "self-defense" provision in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter refers to a country, not an individual, being subjected to armed attack. Panama did not send a single soldier to the U.S. mainland or U.S. territories overseas, so it is completely out of the question to say that Panama launched an armed attack against the U.S. As for the specifics of the December 16th incident, they can be clarified through other means and do not constitute a reason for the U.S. to send troops to invade a sovereign state.

Since the political crisis in Panama in 1987, the U.S. has used political, economic, military, diplomatic, and even assassination methods to force Panamanian Defense Forces Commander Noriega to step down to maintain U.S. strategic interests in the Panama Canal Zone. However, the U.S. plot did not succeed. It was under these circumstances that the U.S. government sent troops to invade and occupy Panama City and the second-largest city, Colón, causing many elderly people, women, and children to suffer, and more than five thousand residents to be displaced. Is this the U.S. military exercising "self-defense"? The facts prove: The one violating the United Nations Charter and trampling on the sovereignty of another country is the U.S. itself.

In fact, the U.S. has long been practicing hegemony in Latin American countries under the guise of "self-defense." As early as the 1920s, the U.S. sent over five thousand marines to invade Nicaragua; in the mid-1950s, the U.S. sent planes to invade Guatemala, overthrowing the democratic government of Arbenz; in the early 1960s, U.S. mercenaries openly invaded Cuba; in the mid-1960s, the U.S. sent marines to interfere in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic; in October 1983, the U.S. sent a "multinational force" of several thousand people to invade Grenada.

The U.S. has written a shameful history of practicing hegemony in Latin America under the banner of the "Monroe Doctrine." Today, when it invades Panama by force, it talks about exercising "self-defense," which is just an old tune played again.

### 是行使“自卫权”还是搞霸权

    是行使“自卫权”还是搞霸权
    新华社记者  肖芳琼
    美国代表在联合国安理会召开的紧急会议上为美国武装入侵巴拿马的行为辩解，说什么美出兵是根据《联合国宪章》第五十一条行使
  “自卫权”。可是，人们不禁要问：一个超级大国派遣大军入侵一个远离美国且只有二百多万人口的小国，究竟是在行使自卫权，还是在搞霸权？
    《联合国宪章》第五十一条规定：联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时，可以行使“自卫之自然权利”。这次美军去巴拿马“自卫”的依据是十二月十六日一名美国军官在巴拿马的本土上同巴拿马人冲突中被击毙。《联合国宪章》第五十一条关于“自卫权”的规定是指一个国家，而不是某一个人受到武力攻击。巴拿马并未向美国本土以及美国在海外的“领地”派一兵一卒，完全谈不到对美国进行了武力攻击。至于十六日事件本身的是非曲直，完全可以通过其他途径弄清，根本构不成美国派兵大举入侵一个主权国家的理由。
    自从一九八七年巴拿马发生政治危机以来，美国采取政治、经济、军事、外交甚至暗杀等手段，胁迫巴拿马国防军司令诺列加下台，以维护美国在巴拿马运河区的战略利益。但是，美国的图谋未能得逞。就是在这种情况下美国政府才出动军队大举入侵，占领了巴拿马首都和第二大城市科隆，使许多老人、妇女和儿童生灵涂炭，五千多居民流离失所。难道这是美军在行使“自卫权”吗？事实证明：违反《联合国宪章》、践踏别国领土主权的不是别人，正是美国自己。
    其实，美国在拉丁美洲国家以“自卫权”之名行强权政治之实，并非从今日始。早在二十年代，美国就派遣了海军陆战队五千余人入侵尼加拉瓜；五十年代中期，美国曾出动飞机入侵危地马拉，推翻了阿本斯民主政府；六十年代初，美国雇佣军公然入侵古巴；六十年代中叶，美出动海军陆战队干涉多米尼加共和国的内部事务；一九八三年十月，美国又出动由数千人组成的“多国部队”入侵格林纳达。
    美国打着“门罗主义”的旗号，写下了一部在拉美实行强权政治的不光彩的历史。今天，它在武装入侵巴拿马时大谈行使“自卫权”，只是老调重弹而已。
