The Central Ballet of China has entered its "thirtieth year." Recently, during the commemoration of its 30th anniversary, the three performances included *Swan Lake*, *Don Quixote*, *Yang Guifei*, and *Lan Hua Hua*, half of which are classic masterpieces and the other half are original creations with a national style, showcasing the artistic styles of three generations of performers and two generations of choreographers.

In 1986, when the Central Ballet of China visited the ballet powerhouses of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the 14 performances in New York were all sold out, with even the standing tickets being snapped up. American dance critics praised the Central Ballet of China as a ballet newcomer with exquisite skills and a fresh style, "successfully using a language that is basically foreign." Many overseas Chinese, including compatriots from Taiwan, were moved to tears and felt proud. The principal of the Royal Ballet School in Britain, Parker, exclaimed: "Chinese ballet dancers are indeed a ballet troupe of world-class level." The ballet dancers of the Soviet Union, known as the "kingdom of ballet," were astonished after watching the Central Ballet of China's *Swan Lake*, *The Blessing*, *The Red Detachment of Women*, and *The Mermaid*, believing that this troupe, which has only been established for over 20 years, seems to have a foundation of over a hundred years. Professor Gushev, who came to China in the 1950s to teach, was particularly excited. An official from the Soviet Ministry of Culture said: "Ballet art originated in Europe. In such a short time, it has developed so rapidly in China, which is truly admirable." Today, the Central Ballet of China is recognized as a world-class ballet troupe. Our country's ballet industry has completed in 30 years what others have taken a hundred years to achieve.

The Central Ballet of China has achieved these results due to the careful support of the Party and the state, and the decades of hard work by the teachers, students, and staff of the dance school and troupe. The Beijing Dance Academy and the troupe have worked together to cultivate batch after batch of outstanding performers. These performers have won 16 medals in numerous international competitions, bringing honor to the motherland. Some performers have also been invited to star in large-scale ballets in famous foreign troupes.

Due to the Party's open policy, performers, based on the Russian ballet foundation of the 1950s, have had the opportunity to learn from and draw on experts and schools from various countries in Europe and America through cultural exchanges. When rehearsing some classic masterpieces, the dancers are good at inheriting and also daring to innovate. They rehearse *Giselle*, *The Sleeping Beauty*, and the pas de deux from *La Bayadère*, without blindly following authority or copying a certain foreign version. Instead, they carefully compare and study the strengths and weaknesses of various versions, drawing widely and deeply, repeatedly refining and perfecting the original work during the rehearsal process, developing and creating it. They not only value the essence of the Russian school but also discard its less appealing aspects, and also pay attention to absorbing the strengths of the British and other schools. In some places, the treatment even exceeds the original ballet specifications, blending the Russian school's exuberance with the British school's elegance, making it more perfect and poetic. They have formed their unique features of focusing on character portrayal and revealing the inner thoughts and feelings of characters, thus winning unanimous high praise from countries around the world. After leaving China for more than 20 years, Gushev saw Chinese people dancing ballet again and felt that the Chinese not only preserved what he taught well but also developed and expanded it, and absorbed the advantages of other countries' schools, forming their own style. Therefore, he predicted: "In a few years, there will be a Chinese school of classical ballet standing on the world stage." Soviet ballet master Ulanova also said she likes Chinese performers very much because they do not just show off their skills and dance but pay attention to the handling of music and movement, pay attention to mastering the style, especially in shaping character images.

How to combine classical ballet with one's own national dance is a question that all countries are exploring. Our country is blessed with 56 ethnic groups and a dance cultural heritage of several thousand years, with rich themes, expressions, and movements in ethnic dances. This is what foreign dancers particularly envy. The dancers of the Central Ballet of China have been working since 1964 to combine classical ballet with our country's rich ethnic dances, striving to make the actions, postures, rhythms, and character images in the ballet both have Chinese characteristics and conform to ballet standards. After the Gang of Four was smashed, they created more than ten large and medium-sized ballets, including *The Blessing*, *Lin Daiyu*, *The Search for Light Trilogy*, *Lan Hua Hua*, and *Yang Guifei*, unremittingly exploring the creation of national style ballets. Although there are inevitably some shortcomings in the exploration process, they all have innovations and are welcomed by audiences at home and abroad. Their creation of the *Yellow River* pas de deux is regarded by the dance world as "marking the independence and maturity of the Chinese ballet school." *The Yellow River* also appeared on the famous stage of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and was performed alongside *Spartacus*, receiving praise. The ballet troupe in Japan also performed *The Yellow River*. The ballet troupe in Canada also performed *Lin Daiyu*. The ballet troupe in the Philippines also performed *The Blessing*, all of which caused a sensation. Foreign critics also praised *The Blessing* and *The Mermaid* as progress and development in ballet, as China's contribution to the world of ballet.

    他们为祖国争得荣誉
    ——纪念中央芭蕾舞团建团三十周年
    陈湘
    中央芭蕾舞团已进入“而立”之年，最近在纪念建团三十周年时演出的三台晚会中，《天鹅湖》、《堂吉诃德》、《杨贵妃》、《兰花花》等剧目，一半是古典名作，一半是自己创作的具有民族风格的舞剧，展示了三代演员、两代编剧的艺术风貌。
    1986年中芭团访问芭蕾大国美、英、苏时，在纽约的14场演出，场场爆满，最后连站票也被抢购一空。美国舞评家称赞中芭团是舞艺精湛而风格清新的芭蕾新秀，“成功地运用了一种基本上是外国的语言”。许多华人包括来自台湾的同胞看了后热泪盈眶，感到自豪。英国皇家舞蹈学校校长帕克赞叹：“中国芭蕾演员不愧是一支具有世界水平的芭蕾队伍。”被称作“芭蕾王国”的苏联舞蹈家们看了中芭团的《天鹅湖》、《祝福》、《红色娘子军》、《鱼美人》后，感到惊异，认为这个团不像仅仅建团20多年的年轻舞团，倒像有上百年基础的。50年代来华传艺的古雪夫教授更是高兴，激动不已。苏联文化部一位官员说：“芭蕾艺术起源于欧洲。经过短短时间，在中国能得到这样快的发展，这是很值得钦佩的。”而今，中央芭蕾舞团已被公认为世界一流舞团。我国芭蕾事业，仅用30年时间就走完了人家用了百年才走完的路。
    中央芭蕾舞团所以能取得这些成绩，是由于党和国家的精心扶持，舞校、舞团师生员工几十年如一日的艰苦奋斗。北京舞蹈学院和舞团同心协力培养出一批批优秀的演员。这些演员在多次国际比赛中夺得了16面奖牌，为祖国争得了荣誉。一些演员还被邀请到国外著名舞团主演大型舞剧。
    由于党的开放政策，使演员们在50年代俄罗斯芭蕾功底的基础上，通过对外文化交流，有机会向欧美各国专家、流派学习、借鉴。在排演一些古典名作精华时，舞蹈家们善于继承，也勇于出新。他们排演《吉赛尔》、《睡美人》、《葛蓓莉娅》双人舞，都没有迷信权威，照搬国外某一版本。而是仔细对比研究了各种版本的短长，广取博采，对原作的处理进行反复推敲，在排演过程中使之更加深化和完善，有所发展，有所创造。他们既重视继承俄罗斯学派的精华，又抛弃其并不美妙之处，也注意吸收英国等国学派之长，使某些地方的处理甚至超出了原来芭蕾的规格范畴，融合了俄罗斯学派的奔放与英国学派的娴雅，更加完美和富于诗意，形成自己独特的以塑造人物、揭示人物内心思想感情为目的的细腻的特色，从而赢得了世界各国一致的高度赞赏。古雪夫离开中国20多年后，再看中国人跳芭蕾，他感到中国人不仅很好地保存了他教给的东西，还加以发扬光大，并吸收了其他国家舞派的优点，形成了自己的风格特点。因而，他预言：“用不了多少年，就会有中国学派的古典芭蕾屹立于世界舞坛之上。”苏联芭蕾大师乌兰诺娃也说她非常喜欢中国演员，因为他们不是光耍技术、光跳舞，而是重视音乐与动作的处理，重视掌握风格，特别是塑造人物形象。
    古典芭蕾和本民族的舞蹈怎么结合，这是世界各国都在探索的问题。我国得天独厚，有56个民族、几千年的舞蹈文化遗产，民族舞蹈题材多样，表现手法和动作十分丰富。这是外国舞蹈家特别羡慕的。中芭团的舞蹈家们，1964年就开始努力，把古典芭蕾舞和我国丰富的民族舞结合起来，在舞剧《红色娘子军》中融入了中国民族特色，力求舞剧的动作、舞姿、韵律、人物形象都既要有中国特色，又要符合芭蕾的规范。粉碎“四人帮”后，又创作了《祝福》、《林黛玉》、《觅光三部曲》、《兰花花》、《杨贵妃》等10多部大、中型芭蕾舞剧，不懈地探索民族风格芭蕾舞剧的创作。虽然在探索过程中难免有这样那样的不足，但都有所创新，受到国内外观众的欢迎。他们创作的《黄河》双人舞，被舞蹈界称为“标志着中国芭蕾学派走向独立和成熟”。《黄河》还登上了著名的莫斯科大剧院舞台与《斯巴达克》同台演出，受到好评。日本的芭蕾舞团也排演了《黄河》。加拿大的芭蕾舞团还排演了《林黛玉》。菲律宾的芭蕾舞团也排演了《祝福》，都引起了轰动。外国评论家还称赞《祝福》、《鱼美人》等是芭蕾舞的进步和发展，是中国对世界芭蕾的贡献。
