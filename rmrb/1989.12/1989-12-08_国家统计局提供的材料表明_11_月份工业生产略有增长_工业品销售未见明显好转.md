    According to the latest data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, in November, the national industrial total output value reached 10.96 billion yuan, an increase of 0.9% compared to the same period last year, with an additional output value of 0.93 billion yuan. The average daily output value was 0.3653 billion yuan, an increase of 0.1% compared to the previous month. From January to November, the national cumulative industrial total output value was 117.65 billion yuan, an increase of 7% compared to the same period last year.

    In terms of ownership structure, the main contributors to growth were township and village enterprises and other types of industries. In November, the output value of state-owned enterprises decreased by 0.4% compared to the same month last year, while the output value of collective-owned enterprises increased by 1.1%. Among them, the output value of urban collective enterprises decreased by 1.9%, a reduction of 0.38 billion yuan, while the output value of township and village enterprises increased by 4.9%. The output value of other types of industries was 4.8 billion yuan, an increase of 19.2%.

    In terms of product composition, the main contributors to growth were light industrial and basic industrial products. In November, the output value of light industry was 5.56 billion yuan, an increase of 0.2%. Yarn, wool yarn, sugar, and cigarettes, among others, saw increases ranging from 4.8% to 14.6%. The output value of heavy industry was 5.4 billion yuan, an increase of 1.6%. Energy production in the same month increased by 6.6%, with steel, steel products, ferroalloys, pig iron, and 10 types of non-ferrous metals seeing increases ranging from 9.1% to 22.4%. Most chemical raw materials saw varying degrees of increase, while the decline in investment-type mechanical and electrical products continued to widen.

    Experts believe that the slight growth in industrial production in November does not mean that the entire industry has emerged from the trough. The mainstay of the industrial economy, state-owned enterprises, is still experiencing negative growth, and there has been no significant improvement in the sales of industrial products. It is necessary to continue to adhere to total quantity control, promote structural adjustments, and strengthen support policies for large and medium-sized enterprises. Currently, efforts should be made to reduce the blindness of production, guard against the tendency to rush output and speed at the end of the year, and avoid further exacerbating product accumulation. In the short term, industrial production will continue to be constrained by the market, funds, and product accumulation. Currently, efforts should be made to increase production reserves and prepare for next year's production as a major task.

### 国家统计局提供的材料表明  11月份工业生产略有增长  工业品销售未见明显好转

    国家统计局提供的材料表明
    11月份工业生产略有增长
    工业品销售未见明显好转
    本报北京12月7日讯　记者张国荣报道：据国家统计局提供的最新材料，11月份全国完成工业总产值1096亿元，比去年同期增长0.9％，增加产值9.3亿元。平均日产值36.53亿元，比上月提高0.1％。1至11月份，全国累计完成工业总产值11765亿元，比去年同期增长7％。
    从所有制构成看，主要是乡办工业和其他类型工业增长。11月份全民所有制工业比去年同月下降0.4％，集体所有制工业增长1.1％，其中城镇集体工业产值下降1.9％，减少3.8亿元，乡办工业增长4.9％，其他类型工业产值48亿元，增长19.2％。
    从产品构成看，主要是轻纺产品和基础工业产品增长。11月份完成轻工业产值556亿元，增长0.2％，纱、毛线、糖、卷烟等增长4.8％至14.6％。重工业产值540亿元，增长1.6％。当月能源生产总量增长6.6％，钢、钢材、铁合金、生铁、10种有色金属增长在9.1％至22.4％，化工原材料中大多数品种有不同程度增长，而投资类机电产品减幅继续增大。
    有关专家分析认为，11月份工业生产略有增长，并不意味着整个工业已经走出低谷，工业经济的主体全民所有制工业仍是负增长，工业品销售也未见明显好转，必须继续坚持总量控制，促进结构调整，强化对大中型企业的扶持政策。当前要减少生产的盲目性，谨防年底压产值、赶速度倾向，避免进一步加重产品积压。从短期看，工业生产将继续受到市场、资金、产品积压的困扰，现在应把增加生产储备，为明年生产作好准备，作为一件大事来抓。
