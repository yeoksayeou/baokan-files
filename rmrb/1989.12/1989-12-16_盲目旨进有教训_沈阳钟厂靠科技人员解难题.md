The first complete quartz clock production line imported by Shenyang Clock Factory from abroad has been unable to operate normally for over three years. Later, Shenyang City organized a technical breakthrough, solving the problem in just two months and turning this burden, caused by blind importation, into a successful project.

The production line cost 3.16 million US dollars. Shenyang Clock Factory had high hopes for it. However, due to trusting foreign merchants too much, the equipment was not thoroughly inspected according to procedures, and errors in the blueprints were not discovered. As a result, more than half of the produced quartz clocks were unqualified, and some even ran backward. However, this alarm did not wake up the factory, which instead continued to invest more, spending an additional 280,000 US dollars to purchase a second set of molds from the same foreign merchant. The result was still not up to standard, causing the imported production line to remain idle for a long time.

Shenyang Clock Factory is one of the three largest clock factories in the country. It was hoped that the imported production line would take off, but instead, it fell into a quagmire. Over the past three years, the enterprise has accumulated debts of 28 million yuan, reaching the point of not being able to cover its production costs and being on the brink of bankruptcy. This spring, the factory again submitted a report to higher authorities, requesting an additional investment of 300,000 US dollars to renovate the production line.

This blind importation, which only trusts foreign technology and does not solve problems, has attracted the attention of the Shenyang Municipal Committee. After investigation and research, the Municipal Committee decided to rely on its own technological strength to untie this knot.

Under the coordination of the Municipal Committee, seven experts from the city's instrumentation, plastics, and electrical fields, along with the factory's technicians, formed a breakthrough team. They carefully studied the relevant technical materials, "diagnosed" the problems in the production of quartz clock movements, such as low assembly qualification rate, small second-hand output torque, and some movements stopping at low temperatures, and solved these technical problems. By the end of October, the 39 quartz clocks they installed passed a one-month trial run with a 100% qualification rate. Later, 300 quartz clocks assembled according to the newly drawn blueprints met the design requirements for 24-hour timekeeping.

This incident has sparked discussions and reflections. An engineer said, solving these technical difficulties is actually not difficult. The imported equipment has been idle for three years, and they still wanted to use foreign exchange to "treat" the problem. An important reason is the blind trust in foreign technology, underestimating their own capabilities, and not placing the focus of importation on improving self-reliance. They thought that buying "foreign equipment" with money would be a big success, which is too naive. It is hoped that the "tuition" paid by Shenyang Clock Factory can provide a beneficial lesson for more people.

    盲目旨进有教训
    ——沈阳钟厂靠科技人员解难题
    新华社记者　姜敏　刘欣欣
    沈阳制钟总厂从国外引进的我国第一条全套石英钟生产线，三年多未能正常生产。后来，沈阳市组织技术攻关，仅用两个月就解决了问题，使这个因为盲目引进造成的包袱很快成为成功的项目。
    这套生产线是花了316万美元引进的，沈阳制钟总厂对于它寄予了大显身手的愿望。然而，由于轻信外商，设备未按程序认真验收，图纸中的错误也没有发现。结果，生产出的石英钟一半以上不合格，有的甚至“倒着走”。但是这个警钟并没有把制钟总厂唤醒，反而继续追加投资，又花费了28万美元向同一外商购买了第二套模具。结果，仍不符合要求，致使引进的生产线长期“趴窝”。
    沈阳制钟总厂是全国三大钟厂之一。本指望引进的这套生产线腾飞，没想到反而因此陷入泥潭。3年来，企业累计欠债2800万元，已到了产不抵债、濒临破产的边缘。今年春天，制钟总厂又向上级打报告，要求再次追加投资30万美元改造生产线。
    这种只迷信外国、又不解决问题的引进，引起了沈阳市委的注意。市委经过调查研究，决定依靠自己的科技力量解开这个包袱。
    在市委的协调下，来自市内的仪表、塑料、电气等方面的7名专家和厂里的技术人员组成攻关小组，并认真消化有关技术资料，“诊断”出石英钟机芯生产中存在的装配合格率低、秒轴输出力矩小，低温时部分机芯停走等“病因”，并解决了这些技术问题。到10月底，他们安装的39台石英钟经过一个月试走，合格率达百分之百。而后按照新绘制的图纸组装的300台石英钟，24小时走时合格率达到了设计要求。
    这件事引起了人们的议论和深思。一位工程师说，解决这几个技术难题，实际上是手到病除并非困难。引进设备“趴窝”3年，还想靠外汇“治病”，一个重要原因就是迷信外国，低估了自己的力量，没有把引进的立足点放在提高自力更生的能力上，以为花钱买来“洋设备”就大功告成了，这种想法是太天真了。希望沈阳制钟总厂交出的“学费”，能给更多人以有益的启示。
