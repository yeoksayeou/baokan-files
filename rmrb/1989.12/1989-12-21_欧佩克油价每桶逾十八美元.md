OPEC oil price exceeds $18 per barrel

According to the news agency of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said on the 19th that the organization's new oil production cut agreement is taking effect, achieving the price target.

OPEC member countries passed an agreement at the end of last month to raise the organization's daily oil production limit for the first half of next year from 20.5 million barrels in the fourth quarter of this year to 22 million barrels, with the average price still set at $18 per barrel.

Although the new agreement will take effect in January next year, the price of OPEC crude oil has already risen from an average of $17.58 per barrel before the agreement was signed to the current $18.53 per barrel.

    欧佩克油价每桶逾十八美元
    据石油输出国组织（欧佩克）通讯社报道，欧佩克秘书长苏布罗托十九日说，该组织新的石油限产协议正在发挥作用，使价格目标得以实现。
    欧佩克成员国上月底通过一项协议，将该组织明年上半年的石油日产限额从今年第四季度的二千零五十万桶提高到二千二百万桶，平均价格仍定为每桶十八美元。
    尽管新协议明年一月才生效，但欧佩克原油的价格已从协议签署前的平均每桶十七点五八美元升至目前的十八点五三美元。
