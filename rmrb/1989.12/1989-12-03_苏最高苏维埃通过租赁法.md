The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has adopted the "Principles of the Leasing Law of the USSR and the Union Republics" and related decisions.

The leasing law, which has been in the works for some time, was repeatedly discussed and amended at the second session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR before it was finally passed. It is considered an important legal document for the economic reforms of the Soviet Union.

The law stipulates that leasing can be implemented in all sectors of the national economy. The objects of leasing include land and other natural resources, enterprises, buildings, transportation vehicles, and so on. Lessees can fully or partially purchase the leased property. The types of enterprises and property that are not allowed to be leased, as well as the property that is restricted or prohibited from being purchased, will be separately regulated by the governments of the USSR and the Union Republics.

According to the newly adopted law, lessees can independently determine the direction of their operations based on the leasing contract and have the right to dispose of their products and income. After fulfilling their contractual obligations, lessees enjoy freedom in their operational activities.

The "Leasing Law of the USSR" will come into effect on January 1, 1990.
