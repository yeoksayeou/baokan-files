The "Warm and Full Belly Project" is an important measure taken by China in some impoverished regions to promote technological poverty alleviation. The specific approach is as follows: the state, in impoverished regions that have suitable conditions for developing corn production, adopts a comprehensive input method of funds, technology, plastic film, fertilizer, and high-quality seeds. This method vigorously promotes the cultivation technology of hybrid corn with plastic film coverage, increases the unit area yield of grain, and within one to two years, ensures that the people's food supply reaches the self-sufficiency level. This approach is vividly referred to by the mountain people as the "Warm and Full Belly Project." The state began implementing the "Warm and Full Belly Project" in impoverished regions nationwide in an organized and planned manner starting in 1989.

In China's high-cold impoverished regions, the promotion of hybrid corn with plastic film can significantly increase the unit area yield. This technology can increase the yield per mu by 100 to 150 kilograms compared to open-field corn cultivation, with some areas achieving an increase of up to 200 kilograms.

    “温饱工程”简介
    “温饱工程”是我国在一些贫困地区搞科技扶贫的一项重要措施。具体做法是：国家在具备条件适宜发展玉米生产的贫困地区，采取资金、技术、地膜、化肥、良种等综合输入的办法，大力推广杂交玉米地膜覆盖栽培技术，提高粮食单位面积产量，在一二年内，使群众的口粮达到自给水平。这种做法被山区群众形象地称之为“温饱工程”。国家从1989年起开始，在全国贫困地区有组织有计划地大面积实施“温饱工程”项目。
    在我国高寒贫困地区推广地膜杂交玉米，可大幅度地提高单位面积产量。这项技术比露地栽培玉米每亩可增产100至150公斤，高的可增产200公斤。
