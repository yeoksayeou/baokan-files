The prolonged market sales slump over the past half year has affected various aspects of society. How should we view this phenomenon? What changes will the market undergo next year? What measures will the commercial sector take? Recently, the reporter interviewed Minister of Commerce Hu Ping on these issues of public concern.

Reporter: The market slump has lasted for over half a year. There are various opinions on this phenomenon. What is your view? Will this slump continue?

Hu Ping: The so-called market slump is relative to the abnormal sales situation last year. I have been working at the Ministry of Commerce for nearly two years. I remember that when I first arrived, the market prices were rising month by month. At that time, a reporter asked me if I had the ability to stabilize market prices. I gave an analogy: the market and prices are like the strong winds in early spring in Beijing—although they blow fiercely, after the wind passes, spring warmth and blossoms follow. Last year, there was a widespread price hike and buying frenzy, but after the "wind" passed this year, with the implementation of the state's macro-control measures, the market has become stable.

Since this year, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have taken a series of effective measures. The overheating economy has started to cool down, and the economic situation is developing in a positive direction. The most prominent manifestation is that the year-on-year growth rates of industrial output value and total retail sales of social commodities have fallen, the national retail price level has been declining month by month, the prices of major staple foods and daily industrial products have remained stable, and the public's perception of price increases is not strong. This is in stark contrast to last year's situation of excessive demand, frequent panic buying, and rapid price increases.

As for the emergence of market slump and stagnation of certain commodities in the process of solving some long-standing problems, we need to analyze this concretely and maintain a clear mind. We need to see that behind the market slump, there are some deep-seated problems and difficulties. Before the fundamental contradiction between total demand and total supply is resolved, the market slump is only a local, temporary, and superficial phenomenon. Recently, some places have seen a positive trend in the sales of commodities that have been stagnant for half a year, such as color TVs and VCRs. Based on the cyclical changes in the market, it can be foreseen that the market trend in 1990 will be stable with some upward momentum, stable with gradual prosperity, stable with some tightness, and stable with some difficulties.

Reporter: You believe that the market in 1990 will be stable with some upward momentum and gradual prosperity, but you also mention stability with some tightness and difficulties. What is the basis for this? Can you elaborate?

Hu Ping: I believe that the stability with upward momentum and prosperity is mainly based on two points. The first point is that the country adheres to the policy of rectification and adjustment, ensuring political stability, which will naturally lead to market stability. Under this premise, first, agricultural production is expected to have a good harvest next year. Second, with the country's policy tilt towards the energy and raw material industries, and with the continuous adjustment of the industrial and product structure by the industrial production departments, it is expected that there will be more marketable commodities supplied next year. Third, the rectification and adjustment of companies is deepening, which will further improve the chaotic situation in the circulation links. Fourth, the country has announced that the "double-tight" policy remains unchanged, achieving the diversion of purchasing power, which will also reduce market pressure. The second point is that from the perspective of purchasing rules, a rebound is inevitable after a slump. This has been mentioned above.

Reporter: In which month will the "upward momentum" and "prosperity" of next year be evident? Can the supply of "food," "clothing," and "daily necessities" that the public is concerned about be guaranteed next year?

Hu Ping: The statement that next year will be stable with upward momentum and gradual prosperity only refers to the overall trend. The situation varies by region and between urban and rural areas, making it difficult to imagine that "upward momentum" and "prosperity" will arrive at the same time.

From the perspective of "food," "clothing," and "daily necessities," the supply of food commodities will be stable and growing next year. There will be a stable supply of grains, pork, fruits, aquatic products, vegetables, as well as tobacco, alcohol, sugar, and tea. Many items will be quite sufficient. The sales of clothing commodities have been normal, and various places have started to focus on cotton production this year. It is estimated that the supply of cotton textiles may be relatively ample after next autumn. The sales of daily necessities have been sluggish this year, but there will be a turnaround next year. The main reason is that many consumers, in the buying frenzy last year, purchased a large amount of inventory. After half a year of use and consumption, it is very likely that they will resume normal shopping activities. Additionally, with the "warming up" of agriculture, the sales of agricultural production materials will also become prosperous.

Reporter: Getting the market out of the slump also involves guiding consumption. In 1990, when the market is stable with some upward momentum and tightness, how will state-owned commerce play a leading role? What does the Ministry of Commerce consider to be the most challenging issue in ensuring market supply next year?

Hu Ping: Consumers have production and living needs and purchasing power, and they will naturally realize their purchasing desires. The goal of building socialism is to gradually improve the living conditions of the people. Therefore, while excessive consumption is wrong, it is also not acceptable to discourage consumption. Moderate and reasonable consumption should still be encouraged.

Currently, the production sector is facing difficulties. As a state-owned commercial operation department, we must establish the idea of serving industrial and agricultural production, actively help the industrial sector adjust its industrial structure, and strive to open up the market for industrial and agricultural products. At present, some retail enterprises are afraid to take risks and are hesitant in purchasing or are eager to engage in "big discounts," artificially exacerbating product accumulation and inducing market slump, which is very undesirable.

Everyone hopes for a stable market, but currently, the market control measures at all levels of government are still very imperfect; some provincial and municipal protectionism is on the rise, causing obstacles in the purchasing and sales channels. The Ministry of Commerce hopes that all regions can unify their understanding, quickly smooth out the circulation channels and purchasing and sales relationships, and ensure the smooth flow of goods.

    近期市场分析与展望
    ——商业部部长胡平访谈录
    本报记者　潘岗
    持续半年多的市场销售“疲软”，影响到社会方方面面。如何看待这一现象？来年市场会有何变化？商业部门又有哪些措施？日前，记者就人们关注的这些问题，访问了商业部长胡平。
    记者：市场疲软至今已持续了半年多。对这个现象的出现，众说纷纭，您对此有何看法？这种疲软现象还会持续下去吗？
    胡平：所谓市场疲软，是相对去年的不正常销售而言。我到商业部工作近两年了。记得去年刚来时正值市场物价逐月上升，当时有记者问我有没有能力把市场物价平抑下来。我打了个比方，市场和物价好像初春北京的大风一样，虽刮得猛，但大风过后，也就春暖花开了。去年出现了大面积的涨价风、抢购风，而“风”过后的今年，随着国家宏观控制措施的出台，市场也就趋于稳定了。
    今年以来，党中央、国务院采取了一系列有效措施，经济过热开始降温，经济形势正朝着好的方向发展。突出的表现为工业总产值、社会商品零售总额比去年同期增幅回落，全国零售物价总水平逐月下降，主要副食品和日用工业品价格平稳，群众对物价上涨感受不太强烈，这同去年需求过旺、抢购频繁、物价上涨过快形成鲜明对比。
    至于在解决多年积累的一些问题的过程中，出现了市场疲软，某些商品滞销等新的矛盾，对此要具体分析，保持清醒的头脑。要看到市场疲软后面存在着一些深层次的问题和困难，在总需求和总供给的矛盾没有根本解决之前，市场疲软只是一种局部的、暂时的、表面的现象。最近一些地方滞销了半年多的彩电、录相机等销售出现了看好势头，根据市场周期性变化规律，可以想见1990年市场趋势将是稳中有升，稳中渐旺，稳中偏紧，稳中有难。
    记者：您认为明年市场稳中有升、稳中渐旺，又认为稳中偏紧，稳中有难，依据是什么？能否详细介绍一下。
    胡平：我认为，稳中有升、渐旺主要依据有两点。第一点，国家坚持治理整顿方针，政治稳定，必然带来市场稳定。在这个大前提下，其一，明年农业生产可望有个好收成。其二，随着国家对能源、原材料工业的政策倾斜，随着工业品生产部门对产业、产品结构的不断调整，明年可望有更适销对路的商品供应市场。其三，公司的清理整顿工作正在深入，这将使流通环节的混乱现象进一步好转。其四，国家已宣布“双紧”方针不变，实现购买力分流，也必将减轻市场压力。第二点，从购销规律看，疲软之后总是要回升的。这在上面已讲过了。
    记者：明年的“升”、“旺”会在哪个月份表现出来？群众关心的“吃”、“穿”、“用”商品，明年能保证供应吗？
    胡平：说明年稳中有升、渐旺，只是指总趋势。各地情况不一，城乡情况不一，很难想象“升”、“旺”会在同一时间到来。
    从“吃”、“穿”、“用”看，吃的商品明年将稳定增长。粮食、猪肉、水果、水产品、蔬菜以及烟酒糖茶，都有稳定货源，很多东西还很充足。穿的商品销售一直正常，今年各地已开始抓棉花生产，估计棉纺织品供应在明年秋季后可能较为宽松。用的商品今年疲软，但在明年会出现转机，原因主要是不少消费者在去年抢购风中，购买了大量存货，经过这半年多的使用、消耗，很有可能重新开始正常的购物活动。另外，随着农业“升温”，农业生产资料销售也会“旺”起来。
    记者：市场走出疲软恐怕还有个引导消费问题。在市场稳中有升、稳中偏紧的1990年，国营商业如何发挥主渠道作用？商业部认为明年搞好市场供应最棘手的问题是什么？
    胡平：消费者有生产、生活需求，有购买能力，必然要实现购买欲望。要将消费者的消费欲望引导到正常的轨道上来。搞社会主义的宗旨就是逐步改善人民群众生活条件。所以，高消费固然不对，但也不能不要消费，适度消费、合理消费还是要提倡的。
    当前，生产部门面临困难。作为国营商业经营部门，要树立为工农业生产服务思想，积极帮助工业调整产业结构，努力为工农业产品开拓市场。目前有些零售企业怕担风险，在进货上观望等待，或热衷于搞减价让利“大甩卖”，人为地加剧了产品积压，诱发市场疲软，很不可取。
    人们都希望市场稳定，但现在各级政府对市场的调控手段还很不完善；一些省市地方保护主义抬头，造成购销渠道不畅。商业部希望各地能够统一认识，尽快理顺流通渠道和购销关系，做到货畅其流。
