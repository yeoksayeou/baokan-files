A County Party Secretary Among the Farmers
- A Record of Shanxi Province Jian County Party Secretary Li Guixi

People's Daily reporter: Wang Aisheng

Broad-shouldered, sturdy, with a dark face, and a rapid-fire way of speaking, he is Li Guixi, the Party Secretary of Jian County, Shanxi Province. In his six years of service in Jian County, he has formed a deep bond with the local farmers.

In January 1984, Li Guixi was assigned to Jian County. This is a half-mountainous and half-hilly area nestled in the Zhongtiao Mountains, where the land is poor, transportation is inconvenient, and farmers rely solely on farming for income. He traveled from village to village, from mountain ridges to valleys, visiting over 100 hamlets. He inspected the dilapidated houses of the farmers and saw their bowls of rice without vegetables. He saw that the majority of the villagers still lived in poverty. The annual per capita income of farmers in the county was only 200 yuan, and in many places, it was barely over 100 yuan. As the county Party Secretary, how could he help the farmers escape poverty? He lay awake at night, pondering. The Party's Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee had new policies, but would the county committee dare to take a new path? During his investigations, he discovered that a few households had become wealthy by planting hawthorn seedlings. Guo Huailang from Zhongyang Village in Zhongyang Township was not particularly skilled in farming, nor did he have a strong financial background. However, he was daring and hardworking. Starting in 1981, he began selling hawthorn seedlings and within just a few years, his annual income exceeded 10,000 yuan.

These newly rich farmers in the countryside gave Li Guixi a great deal of inspiration: if Guo Huailang could become wealthy, why couldn't other farmers? He invited 15 experts from the provincial capital to conduct a comprehensive survey and analysis of the feasibility of planting hawthorn seedlings across the county, considering factors such as geography, soil, and climate. He also sent people to several provinces to gather information about the hawthorn seedling market.

In March of that year, Li Guixi proposed at a county-level cadre meeting: every household in the county should plant two mu of hawthorn seedlings and one mu of hawthorn orchard. This was an inspiring proposal. The county's various departments established 63 hawthorn seedling companies to help farmers sell hawthorn seedlings. By the end of 1985, over 2,400 farmers in the county had planted hawthorn seedlings, covering more than 13,000 mu. The county's hawthorn seedlings were sold nationwide to 17 provinces and over 100 counties, making it one of the few major hawthorn seedling bases in the country. This single initiative increased the annual per capita income of Jian County's farmers by 110 yuan.

A county Party Secretary helping a few farmers with some practical matters is easy. But that is not the true measure of a county Party Secretary. Li Guixi's goal was to gradually enrich all 40,000-plus farming households in the county.

Li Guixi visited Haozhuang Township's Beiniu Village to have a heart-to-heart talk with Party Branch Secretary Liu Quan. Liu Quan is a honest farmer who has gradually improved his life by following the Party. Over the years, he has engaged in the processing of waste plastics, earning over 500,000 yuan, becoming a local wealthy individual. Li Guixi carefully observed the process of waste plastic processing and asked, "Can the entire village do this? If the entire village engages in this, how much investment is needed?" Liu Quan said, "It can be done. If money is short, I can help everyone." In less than a year, several hundred households in Beiniu Village were processing waste plastics. The village's per capita annual income reached over 800 yuan. Li Guixi invited all the township Party Committee Secretaries to Beiniu Village and gave them an assignment: "How will you help farmers quickly escape poverty?" He also required the township and town Party Secretaries to draft plans to guide farmers to prosperity based on the actual conditions of their respective townships.

Li Guixi's vision extended beyond just enriching the current generation of farmers; he also thought long-term. He knew that the poverty of Jian County's farmers in the past was due not only to historical, natural, and geographical reasons but also to the low cultural level of the farmers. He was determined to improve the cultural level of the farmers during his tenure and cultivate farmers with modern cultural knowledge. Having previously worked in education, Li Guixi focused on the basic education of primary and secondary schools across the county. He attended 11 classes in succession at Chengguan Primary School and Middle School and had discussions with teachers and students in various schools. He found that the teaching level of primary and secondary school teachers in the county was relatively low. He called in colleagues from the County Planning Commission and the Education Bureau and said, "No matter how difficult it is, the teacher training school must be established! This is a matter that concerns several generations." The county raised over 2 million yuan to build a teacher training building, but due to the limited space, the teachers in training had nowhere to eat. The neighbor of the training building was the County Economic Commission. Li Guixi called in the County Economic Commission staff and said, "You have a small car garage, but the teachers in training have nowhere to eat. How do you plan to handle this?" Before the County Economic Commission staff could respond, Li Guixi said, "Demolish the car garage and convert it into a dining hall. That's final!"

Li Guixi visited every village in Jian County. Upon entering a village, he would first inspect the school and then talk to the village cadres about the teaching environment. Over several years, the county raised over 50 million yuan to solve the problem of dilapidated primary school buildings.

    农民中的县委书记
    ——记山西绛县县委书记李桂喜
    本报记者　王艾生
    膀大腰圆，黝黑脸膛，说话连珠炮，办事快节奏。他叫李桂喜，是山西省绛县县委书记。在绛县任职的6年中，他同这里农民结下深深的友情。
    1984年1月，李桂喜奉命来到绛县。这是一个地处中条山里的半山半丘陵区，人穷地薄，交通闭塞，农民只靠种粮获点收入。他走村串乡，从山梁到山沟，跑了100多个山庄，查看农家低矮破旧的房舍，端起没有蔬菜的饭碗。他看到乡里大多数农民生活还是低水平。全县农民年人均收入仅200元，不少地方人均100多元。作为县委书记，如何帮助农民摆脱贫困，他彻夜难眠。党的十一届三中全会有新政策，县委敢不敢走新路？他在调查中发现，有个别农户种植山楂苗发了财。中阳乡中阳村的戈怀郎，他种田手艺并不高，家底也不厚，但他敢闯敢干，1981年开始种山楂苗出售，仅仅两三年，年收入一万多元。
    这些农村冒出来的富户，给李桂喜很大启发：戈怀郎能富，其他农民就不能富？他从省城请来15名专家，就全县范围种植山楂苗的可行性进行了地理、土壤、气候等考察论证。他又派人到几个省，获取山楂苗木市场情况。
    当年3月，李桂喜在县三级干部会议上倡导：全县每户农民要种植2分山楂苗木，种植1亩山楂园。这是一个激动人心的倡议。县里各部门先后成立63个山楂苗木公司，帮助农民推销山楂苗木。到1985年底，全县种植山楂苗木的农民达2400多个，种植山楂苗1.3万余亩。这个县的山楂苗木行销全国17个省的100多个县，成了全国少有的山楂苗木基地。仅此一项，绛县农民年人均收入增加110元。
    一个县委书记，要为几户农民办点实事，这很容易。但这不是县委书记的本事。李桂喜的目标是要使全县四万多户农民都逐步富起来。
    李桂喜来到郝庄乡北牛坞村同党支部书记刘全家谈心。这是一位多年跟着党逐渐过上好日子的老实农民。几年来，他搞废塑料加工，收入达50多万元，成为当地的富户。李桂喜看了废塑料加工的过程很仔细地问：“你这种加工生产，全村能不能搞！如果全村农民都搞，投资多少？”刘全家说：“能搞。钱少，我可以帮助大伙。”北牛坞村用了不到一年时间，几百户农民都搞废旧塑料加工。全村人均年收入达到800多元。李桂喜把全县的乡党委书记请到北牛坞，给他们出了一道题：“你们怎样帮助农民尽快摆脱贫困？”并要求乡、镇书记们都根据本乡的实际，拟出引导农民致富的方案。
    李桂喜想的不光是要使这一代农民逐渐富起来，他还想得很远。他深知，绛县农民过去所以贫困，除了历史、自然、地理的原因外，一个重要的原因是农民文化素质低。他决意在任职期内，着力提高农民文化素质，培养具有现代文化知识的农民。曾从事过教育工作的李桂喜，紧紧盯住全县小学、中学基础教育。他连续在城关小学及中学听了11节课，又到各学校同教师学生座谈。他发现，全县中、小学教师水平偏低。他把县计委、教育局的同志找来说：“无论有多大困难，教师进修学校非办不可！这是关系几代人的大事。”县里筹集20多万元，盖起教师培训楼，但因地方太窄，进修的教师没处吃饭。培训楼的邻居是县经委。李桂喜把县经委的人叫来说：“你们有小汽车库房，进修教师却没有地方吃饭，这事，你们看怎么处理？”没等县经委的同志回答，李桂喜说：“把小车库拆了，改建成饭堂，就这么定了！”
    李桂喜跑遍绛县的每个村庄，每进一村，先看学校，先找村干部谈学校教学环境。连续几年，全县筹集资金500余万元，解决了小学的所有危房。
