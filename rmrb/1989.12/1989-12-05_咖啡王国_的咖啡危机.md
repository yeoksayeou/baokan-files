Xinhua News Agency, Brazil, December 4th.

In mid-November, a farmer named Paulo Vieira in Minas Gerais, Brazil, used a tractor to destroy coffee trees on his farm, uprooting 15,000 mature coffee trees in one go. The "green gold" that had been carefully cultivated over many years was thus destroyed, what a pity! However, such actions of destroying coffee plantations, like Vieira's, are now common in the main coffee-growing regions of central and southeastern Brazil. Many long-standing coffee production cooperatives have been forced to shut down, laying off large numbers of workers, and some have converted their coffee plantations into orchards, pastures, or switched to other crops. Local newspapers have commented that if this trend continues, Brazil's century-long title of the "Coffee Kingdom" may not be sustainable.

According to statistics from Jaime Noguera, chairman of the Brazilian National Coffee Association, by the end of this year, 8.4 billion coffee trees nationwide will have been destroyed, with another 6 billion trees also facing destruction, accounting for 16% of the national coffee planting area. He also predicts that by the end of next year, the total number of destroyed coffee trees will reach 25 billion, and the national coffee production will decrease by 30% within two years.

Such large-scale destruction of coffee plantations is rare in Brazil's history. At first glance, it seems hard to understand, but after hearing their explanations, it becomes clear. A chairman of a coffee production cooperative said, "Now, planting coffee not only fails to make a profit but also incurs losses, and the outflow of funds forces us, tens of thousands of producers, to abandon the business." Someone even calculated the following: In Brazil, the production cost of each bag of coffee is equivalent to $70, while the current selling price is only $58. Producers also have to bear numerous taxes, with the tax amount accounting for 52% of the product's sales revenue. If production funds need to be borrowed from banks, the monthly interest rate is as high as 50%. These factors have plunged the vast majority of coffee producers into a crisis of bankruptcy.

The root cause of Brazil's coffee production crisis lies in the severe imbalance of supply and demand in the international market and the resulting "price war." In the past two years, coffee has been in abundant supply worldwide, with an annual total production of over 88 million bags, while the annual total consumption is approximately 68 million bags. This oversupply trend has led coffee exporting countries to vie for market share. Under normal circumstances, coffee exports are allocated by quota, with each country's quota determined by negotiations among the 74 coffee-producing and consuming countries that make up the International Coffee Organization. This year, due to the severe imbalance in supply and demand, it was impossible to reach a quota agreement, and in July, the organization had to announce the cancellation of the export quota system for member countries. As a result, not only did the products of coffee exporting countries flood the market, but some consuming countries also competed to sell their stockpiled coffee beans, leading to a sharp drop in coffee prices. Statistics show that the price per ton of coffee on the international market in May this year was $2,937, but by October, it had fallen to $1,721, a difference of 41%, reaching the lowest point in 15 years.

Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter, with an annual production of over 30 million bags (each bag weighing 60 kilograms). Nearly 5 million people are directly or indirectly engaged in coffee production. Last year, Brazil exported 16 million bags of coffee, earning $2.5 billion in foreign exchange. This year, due to the cancellation of quotas and the drop in prices, the export volume is estimated to reach 20 million bags, but the income will only be $1.5 billion. For the entire Latin American region, coffee production accounts for approximately 70% of the world's total production. This year, the losses caused by the "price war" are estimated to be $2.7 billion.

To regulate the supply and demand of coffee and strive to restore market prices, an emergency consultation was held among relevant countries during the summit of American heads of state at the end of October in San José. Some coffee exporting countries proposed that Brazil should first reduce part of its export volume, and then other exporting countries should make corresponding reductions, thereby facilitating the signing of a new export quota agreement. However, Brazil believes that over the past few decades, its coffee production and exports have significantly decreased, while during this period, the coffee production and export volumes of other countries in the world have increased. Now, asking it to give up more market share is unacceptable, and the consultation thus ended in failure, with the situation still at a standstill. The International Coffee Organization will hold a meeting next April to re-discuss the export quota issue, but whether an agreement can be reached is still uncertain.

For Brazilian coffee producers, apart from the low international market prices, the unfavorable factors also include the worsening domestic economic situation, continuous inflation, and the resulting high production costs, high tax rates, and high borrowing interest rates, known as the "three highs" difficulties. In recent periods, large-scale rallies and demonstrations have been held by many Brazilian coffee business owners and workers, demanding that the government provide low-interest production loans, reduce tax rates, and adjust exchange rates to help producers get through the difficult times. However, currently, Brazil is in the midst of national elections, and the current government is in a maintenance state, with no time to adjust agricultural policies. Only after the new government takes office next March can new decisions be made.

### “咖啡王国”的咖啡危机

    “咖啡王国”的咖啡危机
    本报记者　兰才基
    11月中旬，巴西米纳斯州一位名叫保罗·比埃拉的庄园主用拖拉机在自己庄园里大毁咖啡树，一口气铲除了1.5万株壮年咖啡树。经过多年精心培育起来的“绿色金子”就这样毁于一旦，多么可惜啊！但是，像比埃拉这样毁掉咖啡林的举动，目前在巴西中部和东南部主要种植区到处可见，不少多年从事咖啡生产的合作社被迫弃业，大批解雇工人，有的将咖啡园改为果园、牧场或改种其它作物。当地一些报纸评论说，这种趋势如果继续发展，不出几年，巴西保持了一个多世纪的“咖啡王国”的称号就保不住了。
    据巴西全国咖啡协会主席海梅·诺格拉所作的统计，到今年12月为止，全国被毁掉的咖啡树达到8.4亿株，另有6亿株也即将被铲除，占全国咖啡种植面积的16％。他还预计，到明年为止，被毁掉的咖啡树总共将达到25亿株，两年内全国咖啡产量将减少30％。
    这种大面积毁掉咖啡林的举动，在巴西历史上是不多见的，乍听起来似乎很难理解，但听了他们的叙述也就不以为奇了。一位咖啡生产合作社主席说：“现在种植咖啡不仅无法盈利，而且倒贴成本，资金流失迫使我们成千上万的生产者弃业。”有人还算过这样一笔账：在巴西每袋咖啡的生产成本折合70美元，而目前售价只有58美元，生产者还要负担名目繁多的赋税，税额占产品销售额52％，如果要向银行借贷生产资金，付出的月利率高达50％。这些因素使得广大的咖啡业者陷入了破产的危机。
    巴西咖啡生产危机根源在于国际市场供求关系严重失衡和由此而引起的一场“价格战”。近两年内，世界各地咖啡普遍丰收，年总产量达到8800多万袋，而年总消费量约为6800万袋，这种供过于求的趋势使咖啡出口国想方设法抢占市场。在一般情况下，咖啡出口是按份额分配的，各国份额由世界74个咖啡生产国和消费国组成的国际咖啡组织协商拟定。今年由于供求关系严重失调，已经无法达成配额协议，7月份该组织只好宣布取消对成员国的出口配额制。这样一来，不仅咖啡出口国的产品大量涌入市场，而且一些消费国也竞相抛售自己储备的咖啡豆，导致咖啡价格狂跌。据统计，今年5月份国际市场每吨咖啡售价为2937美元，10月份降至1721美元，相差41％，跌到了15年来的最低点。
    巴西是世界最大的咖啡生产和出口国，年产量一般达3000多万袋（每袋60公斤），直接和间接从事咖啡生产的人数将近500万。去年巴西出口咖啡1600万袋，获外汇收入25亿美元，今年由于取消配额，价格跌落，出口量估计将达2000万袋，而收入只能达到15亿美元。就整个拉美地区来说，咖啡产量占全世界总产量约70％，今年由于“价格战”带来的损失估计达27亿美元。
    为了调节咖啡供求关系和争取恢复市场价格，10月底在圣何塞举行美洲国家首脑会议之际，有关国家再次进行紧急磋商。一些咖啡出口国提出要求巴西首先削减一部分出口额，而后其它出口国也相应作一些削减，以此促成新的出口配额协议的签订。但巴西认为，近几十年内巴西的咖啡生产与出口已经大幅度减少，在此期间世界其它国家的咖啡产量和出口量随之上升，现在还要求它再次让出市场，表示无法接受，这次磋商也就未果而终，至今仍处于僵持状态。国际咖啡组织将于明年4月举行会议，重新商讨出口配额问题，到时能否达成协议，还是一个问号。
    对巴西咖啡生产者来说，不利因素除了国际市场价格偏低以外，还在于国内经济形势恶化，通货膨胀不断加剧，由此带来了生产成本高、税率高和借贷利率高的所谓“三高”困难处境。近一时期，巴西大批咖啡业主和工人举行大规模集会示威，要求政府提供低息生产信贷、降低税率和调整汇率，帮助生产者度过难关。可是，目前巴西全国正在忙于大选，现政府处于维持状态，已无暇顾及调整农业政策问题，只能等待明年3月新政府上台以后才可能拿出新的决策。
