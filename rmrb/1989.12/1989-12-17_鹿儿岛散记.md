Kagoshima, located in southern Kyushu, Japan, is a land full of charm. The Takachiho Peak in Kirishima National Park attracts tourists and pilgrims with its beautiful scenery and the myth of "the descent of the heavenly grandson." The Satsunan Islands, scattered like pearls in the sea, feature ancient cedar forests with trees thousands of years old, as well as a modern rocket launch site representing cutting-edge technology. The Sakurajima volcano, embraced by Kinko Bay, spews smoke year-round, and during the summer, volcanic ash falls in Kagoshima City, three kilometers away, creating a picturesque scene for travelers. Walking on Sakurajima, you encounter rugged rocks and lava boulders as large as houses, making you feel like you're on the moon. The natural sand bath hot spring on the beach is the only one in Japan, offering a way to relieve travel fatigue.

However, despite Kagoshima's beautiful scenery that delights the heart, our trip to Kagoshima was not for sightseeing. This is a place where Chinese and Japanese cultures intersect. The Tang Dynasty monk Jianzhen traveled east to Japan and finally landed here.

Under the starry sky, we arrived in Kagoshima City in the thin fog. After settling our luggage, our local guide, Xiao Yang, said he would treat us to "chicken rice," which sounded intriguing. When the dish arrived, we discovered it was rice with chicken soup, delicious and with a Chinese flavor. It turned out that "chicken rice" is a local specialty from Amami Oshima, originating from China. Additionally, Kagoshima's fried pork cutlets and other fried foods were brought from Fujian, and "Satsuma sake" was brewed using techniques learned from China during the Tang Dynasty. The Japanese call sweet potatoes "Satsuma (old name for Kagoshima) imo," but locals call them "Tang imo." Scholars have traced the ancestry of part of the Yamato people to Southeast Asia and the Chinese mainland, landing here. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, tens of thousands of people came from the mainland to Kyushu. The culture of the Kyushu region retains many Chinese influences, which is related to this. No wonder Chinese people feel a special affinity when they come to the Kyushu region.

The landing site of Master Jianzhen is at the southern tip of Kagoshima, in a place called Akune Town, specifically in a place named Akomeura. Akune was once one of Japan's three major trading ports and a resting place for the ships of the envoys to Tang China. The next day, on our way to Akomeura, we passed through a village called "Tangrenmachi," which has a "Tangren Temple." Although it is now desolate, the cobblestone paths within the town speak of its past prosperity. This place was originally a settlement for Chinese people. After the Edo Shogunate issued the "Sakoku Edict" in 1635, most Chinese people moved to Nagasaki, and this place gradually declined. Although the Tangren Temple is now empty, it is always filled with incense and fresh flowers. Many villagers still have surnames like Lin and Guan, clearly descendants of Chinese people.

Akomeura is calm and tranquil, with two steep rock mountains standing in the sea by the shore. Looking out to the horizon, all you see is the endless sea, and beyond that, Ningbo. Master Jianzhen's memorial stands on a hillside in a memorial park by the shore. In 1953, Japanese friends built a memorial stone here to commemorate the 1200th anniversary of Master Jianzhen's voyage to Japan. The stone, about 2 meters high, is made of granite. Behind the stone, five pine trees stand in a row, forming a pine wall. On December 20, 753 AD, at the hour of the horse on the day of the rooster, Master Jianzhen, at the age of 66 and blind, finally reached Japan after 11 years, six attempts, and five failures. The inscription on the memorial reads: "The Tang monk Jianzhen landed here, the first to set foot on Japanese soil. From this point, the culture of our country has added more luster." Standing in front of the memorial, gazing at the East China Sea, and thinking of Master Jianzhen's determination to spread Chinese culture despite hardships, his sincerity has become a symbol of Sino-Japanese friendship, stirring the heart. According to Chinese customs, we placed a red flag with five stars on the memorial and bowed three times deeply.

Master Jianzhen's achievements are well-known. The former mayor of Akune Town, Mr. Haru, praised Master Jianzhen as a great benefactor of Japan. Every year after the Obon Festival, they hold a "Jianzhen Festival" and have a famous architect build a simple yet elegant "Embassy to Tang China" in the Tang Dynasty style.

In fact, the respect Japanese friends have for Master Jianzhen is not limited to Akune Town. Returning to Kagoshima City, we hurried to attend a friendly gathering organized by the "Chinese Fellowship House." There were company employees, university professors, housewives, and some who were fluent in Chinese. The Fellowship House is a grassroots organization dedicated to Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, receiving Chinese trainees, and promoting Master Jianzhen's deeds. They have initiated fundraising activities for the Great Khingan Fire and recently launched the "Green Envoy to Tang China" activity to support China's greening efforts. Among the crowd, we felt the respect for Chinese culture and heard the sentiment, "Without friendship with China, there is no future for Japan." Reflecting on the words printed on the Fellowship House's business card, "Jade in the mountain moistens the grass and trees, and the spring in the abyss does not wither the cliffs," we felt tears welling up. "The moon rises over the sea, and we share this moment at the end of the world." The "Shared Moon Pavilion" in Kagoshima City can attest to this: the belief in friendship rooted in the hearts of the two peoples is like a pearl and a moon that shines brightly despite the storms.

    鹿儿岛散记
    孙东民
    日本九州南部的鹿儿岛，是一块富有魅力的土地。雾岛国立自然公园内的高千穗峰，以秀美的景色和“天孙降临”的神话吸引着游人和朝拜者；如珍珠般镶嵌在大海中的萨南群岛，既有树龄达数千年的原始杉木森林，也有代表着现代尖端技术的宇宙火箭发射基地；那被锦江湾环抱的樱岛火山，终年喷烟吐雾，每临夏季，3公里外的鹿儿岛市内火山灰飘落，又是旅行者眼中的风物诗。漫步樱岛，嶙峋的怪石、大如房屋的熔岩，如同进入月球的世界；那海滩上日本唯一的自然砂浴温泉，又可使你解除旅途的劳顿……。
    然而，尽管鹿儿岛的美景秀色使人心旷神怡，我们去鹿儿岛旅行并不在揽胜。这里是中日文化的接点，唐代高僧鉴真大师东渡扶桑，最终就在这里上陆。
    天幕上闪烁着点点星斗，我们在薄幕中到达鹿儿岛市内。放下行李，为我们当向导的当地侨胞小杨说要请我们吃“鸡饭”，颇觉新奇。饭端上来，才知道是鸡汤浇饭，味道鲜美，菜肴均具中国风味。原来“鸡饭”是当地特色食品，来自奄美大岛，源于中国。此外，鹿儿岛的炸猪排等油炸物是从福建传来，“萨摩烧酒”是唐代从中国学的酿造技术。日本称红薯为
  “萨摩（鹿儿岛旧称）芋”，而当地人却叫“唐芋”。学者考证，大和民族的一部分祖先是从东南亚及中国大陆由此上陆。仅明清两代，由大陆来九州者有数万之众。九州地区文化多有中国遗风，与此不无关系。怪不得来到九州地区，中国人都有一种说不出的亲近感呢。
    鉴真大师的登陆地，是鹿儿岛南端的坊津町，一个叫秋目浦的地方。坊津古为日本三大贸易港之一，曾是遣唐使船的休泊地。第二天前往秋目浦途中，经过一个叫“唐人町”的村落，有“唐人祠”。而今虽然冷落，町内的青石板路却在诉说着昔日的繁荣。此地原为中国人集居地，1635年江户幕府颁布
  “锁国令”后，大部分中国人迁入长崎，此地才逐渐式微。而今唐人祠虽空无一物，但却一直香火、鲜花不断，这里的村人不少仍姓林、关二姓，显然是中国人的后裔。
    秋目浦是日水平浪静，两座陡峭的岩山插立岸边的海中。极目望去，只是无际的大海，大海的那边面对着宁波。大师的纪念碑就立在岸边山坡上的纪念公园里。1953年，日本友人为纪念大师东渡1200年，在这里建起了“鉴真大师渡沧海遥来之地”纪念碑。碑高约2米，花岗岩雕成，碑后一字排列的5株松树已长成一面松墙。公元753年12月20日乙酉午刻，大师在历时11年，六次浮槎、5次失败之后，终于以66岁高龄的盲目之身到达日本。纪念碑的碑文上写着：“唐鉴真大和尚在此上陆，首次踏上日本国土。由此，本国的文化更增添光辉。”站在纪念碑前，眺望东海，遥想大师当年怀山川异域、风月同天之志，为弘扬中国文化艰辛备尝，一片精诚，成为中日友好的象征，心潮起伏。按照中国的风俗，我们把一面五星红旗立放于碑上，深深地向纪念碑行三度鞠躬礼。
    鉴真大师的业绩有口皆碑。坊津町老町长原先生口称大师是日本的大恩人。这里每年在盂兰盆节后都举行“鉴真祭”，还请名建筑师仿唐代风格建起一座古朴而高雅的“遣唐使馆”。
    其实，日本朋友对大师的敬重又何止坊津町。回到鹿儿岛市内，又赶去参加《中国同人馆》组织的友好集会。有公司职员、大学教授、家庭主妇，其中不乏精通中文者。同人馆是专门从事中日文化交流、接待中国研修生，显彰鉴真大师功德等活动的草根组织，曾为大兴安岭火灾发起募捐活动，最近又起支援中国绿化的“绿色遣唐使”活动。置身人群中，感到的是朋友们对中国文化的敬仰，听到的是“不与中国友好，便没有日本的未来”的心声，回味着《中国同人馆》印在名片上的“玉在山而草木润，渊生珠而崖不枯”的语句，只觉得眼角发热。“海上生明月，天涯共此时”，鹿儿岛市内的《共月亭》可以作证：植根于两国民众心中友好的信念，不就是历经风雨的磨难而不减光辉的珠玉和明月吗？（附图片）
