Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th.

Master Li Keran, your immortal name has today entered the eternal hall of human history. Master Li, my deeply revered teacher, since I was a child, I have been under your tutelage for over thirty years. Your profound and extensive knowledge, humble and amiable character, and lofty and steadfast integrity have always inspired me, becoming my exemplar of self-improvement and perseverance in the face of any hardship.

Thirty-two years ago, you led our class of young students to the Summer Palace for sketching. By the stone boat at the Yansheng Hall, we listened to your patient instructions every evening. You reviewed our crude sketches one by one, and every word you spoke was so precise and insightful. Even many years later, your deep, philosophical words with a Suzhou accent from northern Jiangsu are still deeply etched in our hearts, ever fresh. The core of your entire artistic philosophy is to use the profound aesthetic ideals of the East to revive and promote our national culture. From your unshakable conviction, we felt the pride and glory of being Chinese. We have every reason to stir up the vast waves of the times in the long river of Chinese culture, thereby making the dawn of the Eastern Renaissance gradually rise.

Master Li's romantic spirit is not built on empty talk and fantasy. He demands that we approach tradition with the utmost effort to delve deeply and with the utmost courage to break out. He passed on to us the famous words of Huang Binghong: "Without day and night, even if it's a thousand difficulties, a million hardships." Master Li compares overcoming artistic difficulties to a lion fighting an elephant. He told us: the elephant is enormous and incredibly strong. To conquer it, one must fight with all one's life, like a lion, to perhaps gain victory. If one thinks that art is an easy task, one will end up mediocre and achieve nothing. Master Li, who calls himself a "hard study" advocate, does not believe in innate knowledge. He believes that all true knowledge comes from arduous practice over many years. Master Li's demands for success are the highest, so even in his later years, his paintings often bear the seal "White-haired Student." He himself never stopped climbing in the realm of art. A few years ago, when cultural nihilism was rampant and some people were attacking Chinese painting with all their might, Master Li's studio was still brightly lit. In a calm and distant attitude, he walked unyieldingly on the rugged path of art. He firmly believed that his path was that of the nation and the times, so he had no hesitation. When discussing this topic with anyone, he would use his charming logic and concise language to convince them.

When I graduated from university, Master Li gave me a calligraphy piece, large enough to cover a whole sheet of paper, yet powerful and meaningful. It read: "Seventy-two Trials, Xuanzang's Journey to the West for the Scriptures, not fearing the seventy-two trials, now I give these four characters to my student Fan Zeng." From youth to adulthood, through the long journey of life, through the ten years of turmoil, rain and wind, I held this calligraphy piece and escaped countless hardships. I still treasure it today, knowing that it contains the old man's deep affection.

Thirty years later, when I had the strength to dedicate an Eastern Art Hall, Master Li gave me four more characters, again large enough to cover a whole sheet of paper, but truly resounding and weighty. It read: "The East is Bright." Some say that Chinese cultural tradition has reached its end, but I foresee the dawn of the Eastern Renaissance. Therefore, I borrowed the last four characters from Su Shi's "The Red Cliff," to write this as a testament. This is akin to Master Li's call for the soul of the Chinese nation to return. A few words are enough to make those who forget their roots ashamed. Master Li told me that he recently wanted to have two seals carved, one reading "The East is Bright," and the other "Chinese." He said that being a Chinese is truly an honor. Our science and technology may be behind others, but Chinese philosophy, literature, and art should not be underestimated. Not only did they lead the world in ancient times, but they will also have a brilliant future. I received the four-character calligraphy, "The East is Bright," and was overjoyed. I told Master Li that when the Eastern Art Hall is completed, these four characters will be engraved on the stone stele in front of the hall, and I want to use the stone of Mount Tai to erect this great stele. Master Li was delighted and said, "Mount Tai is the leader of the Five Sacred Mountains, a symbol of China. This stele is full of imagination." Master Li agreed that after the hall is completed, he would come to Tianjin. How I wish I could invite my teacher to see this hall!

A month has passed, the ink is not yet dry, but the sage has withered, and his voice and appearance have vanished. My grief is indescribable at this moment. For thirty years, Master Li's kindness to me has been as heavy as a mountain. In the future Eastern Art Hall, Master Li's thoughts will forever shine on the later generations of artists. They will know that the great land of China has had such a sincere singer, using his brilliant works and upright life to testify to history. The dawn of the Renaissance is ahead, and the morning star is already at its zenith!

    江山无尽　宗师不朽
    ——痛悼恩师李可染先生
    范曾
    李可染先生，您不朽的名字，今天走进了人类历史永恒的殿堂。可染先生，我深深景仰的恩师，自少小厕身先生门墙，三十多年来，他博雅深邃的学识、谦逊和蔼的性格、崇高坚韧的品节，无时不黾勉着我，成为我在任何艰难颠厥之中自强不息的典范。
    三十二年前，先生带我们一班青年学生到颐和园写生，在石舫旁的延清赏楼，我们每晚聆听先生的谆谆教诲，他一幅幅地审评我们十分稚拙的习作，他的每一句话都那么切中要害，那么入木三分，以至很多年后，他那带有苏北徐州口音的沉稳而富有哲理的语言，都深深铭记于我们心头，历久弥新。他的全部艺术思想的核心是必须用东方人深刻的美学理想，光复弘扬我们民族的文化。从可染先生坚如磐石的信念中，我们感受到的是作为一个中国人的自豪和骄傲，我们完全有理由在中国文化的长河里激起时代的宏阔的波涛，从而使东方的文艺复兴的曙光冉冉升起。可染先生浪漫主义的情怀不是建立在空谈和玄想之上的，他要求我们对待传统要以最大的功力打进去，以最大的勇气打出来。他将当年白石先生勉励他的名言：“不分日日夜夜，哪怕千难万难”转赠我们，先生把艺术困境的克服比作以狮搏象，他告诉我们：象，体大无朋，力大无穷，要征服他，必如狮子一般，拚其全部生命，庶几获得胜利，倘若以为艺术是件轻而易举的事，那将碌碌终身、一事无成。自称苦学派的可染先生，不相信生而知之，他以为一切真知必然来源于刻苦的、积以年月的实践，可染先生对成功的要求至大至高，因此直到晚年，他的画上常钤“白发学童”一印，他自己从来没有停止过在艺术上的攀登，前些年当民族虚无主义甚嚣尘上，某些人攻击中国画不遗余力的时候，李可染先生的画室却依然一灯荧然，在宁静致远的心态中，在崎岖的艺术道路上誓无反顾地前行，他坚信自己的道路是民族的、时代的，因此没有丝毫的犹豫，他和所有的人论及这个命题时，都会用富有魅力的逻辑力量和要言不繁的语句使对方心悦诚服。
    当我大学毕业的时候可染先生题字一张送我，大可盈尺，却力透纸背、意味深长，词云：“七十二难，玄奘西天取经，不畏七十二难，今以此四字书赠范曾同学。”自少及壮，漫漫人生，十年浩劫，雨狂风骤，我怀抱着这张字，躲避过种种的艰难境遇，至今珍藏着，我知道，其中包含着老人的一片拳拳爱心。
    三十年后，当我已有力量奉献出一座东方艺术大楼的时候，可染先生又题四字赠我，依然是大可盈尺，然而真是金声玉振，一字千钧，词云：“东方既白，人谓中国文化传统已至末路，而我预见东方文艺复兴曙光，因借东坡赤壁赋末句四字，书此存证。”这不啻是可染先生对中华民族“魂兮归来”的呼唤，寥寥数语，足令数典忘祖者无地自容。可染先生告诉我，他最近要请人刻两方印，一曰“东方既白”，一曰“中国人”，他说作一个中国人是真正光荣的，我们的科技或许落后于人，然而中国的哲学、文学、艺术却不能妄自菲薄，不仅在古代曾领袖天下，今后也必有极绚烂的前景。我得“东方既白”四个题字，不禁喜出过望，我告诉先生，当东方艺术大楼落成之时，这四字将镌刻于楼前石雕的碑面，而且我想用泰山之石树此巨碑。先生高兴地笑了，他说泰山是五岳之尊，是中国的象征，这座石碑富于想象力，可染先生答应我，大楼落成之后，他会来天津的，我多么想请老师看看这座大楼啊！
    睽违一月，墨渖未干而哲人其萎、音容顿杳，我的悲痛难以在此时述其万一，三十年来先生对我恩重如山，在未来的东方艺术大楼，先生的思想永远会光照艺途的后来人，他们知道中华的大地山河，曾有这样一位永远虔诚的讴歌者，用他辉煌的作品和正直的一生为历史存证，文艺复兴曙光在前，启明星已到中天！
