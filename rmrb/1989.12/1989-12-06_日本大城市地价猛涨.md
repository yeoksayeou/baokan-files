According to a report by Kyodo News Agency, a recent survey by a Japanese real estate research department reveals that over the past half-year, the land prices in the commercial and residential areas of Japan's six major cities—Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Tokyo—have increased by an average of 13.6%. Over the past decade, the increase has been 257%.

Among these cities, the most significant price increases have occurred in the Kansai region, specifically in Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. In these three cities, commercial area land prices have risen by an average of 20.9%, and residential area prices by 20.4% over the past half-year. Nagoya's land price increase rate is second only to these three cities.

In contrast, Tokyo's land prices have only increased by 0.5% over the past half-year. Some real estate industry insiders believe that after last year's sharp rise, Tokyo's land prices have stabilized due to various government control measures. However, this stability is showing signs of another upward trend.

The survey report also indicates that the average land prices in 140 Japanese cities have increased by 75% over the past decade and by 5.4% over the past half-year.

    日本大城市地价猛涨
    据共同社援引日本一家不动产研究部门最近宣布的一项调查报告报道，近半年来，日本大阪、京都、神户、名古屋、横滨和东京这6大城市商业区和居住区地价平均上涨13.6％。近10年来上涨257％。
    其中，地价上涨最甚的是关西地区的大阪、京都和神户，半年来这3个城市商业区地价平均上涨20.9％，居住区上涨20.4％。名古屋地价上涨率仅次于这3个城市。
    与此形成对照的是，日本东京近半年来地价仅上涨了0.5％。日本一些不动产业界人士认为，东京的地价在去年出现暴涨以后，由于政府采取各种抑制措施，今年以来趋于平稳，但是这种平稳又重新出现上涨的动向。
    这项调查报告还表明，日本140个城市平均地价近10年上涨了75％，近半年上涨了5.4％。
