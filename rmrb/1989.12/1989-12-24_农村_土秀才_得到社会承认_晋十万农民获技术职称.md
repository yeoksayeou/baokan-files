Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 23rd — (Reporter Du Wenfeng) Farmer-breeder Zhang Yuanfang has successfully bred five high-yielding new wheat varieties over the past ten years, which have been promoted and planted in more than 20 provinces and municipalities nationwide. Recently, he was awarded the title of "Farmer Technician." Currently, nearly 100,000 farmers in Shanxi have obtained titles such as Farmer Technician, Farmer Assistant Technician, Farmer Technician, and Farmer Assistant Technician in 20 different specialties, including agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and township enterprises. They are technical talents in their respective fields.

Last year, Shanxi Province began a comprehensive evaluation of technical titles for farmers with technical expertise. The evaluation process is very strict. Farmers first apply for title levels based on their technical skills, achievements, papers, and other relevant information. Then, local science and technology associations and other departments conduct examinations and reviews. Only after meeting all the requirements, they are issued title certificates. These "local scholars" have been recognized by relevant departments, and the public is more willing to seek their advice.

    农村“土秀才”得到社会承认
    晋十万农民获技术职称
    据新华社太原十二月二十三日电　（记者杜文峰）农民育种专家张元芳，十年培育成功五个小麦高产新品种，在全国二十多个省市区推广种植。近日他获得了“农民技师”的职称。目前山西有近十万农民获得了农民技师、农民助理技师、农民技术员、农民助理技术员技术职称。他们是在农、林、水、畜牧、乡镇企业等二十个专业中各有所长的技术人才。
    去年底，山西省全面开始为有技术专长的农民评定专业技术职称。评定工作十分严格，先由农民根据自己的技术水平和技术成果、论文等情况，申报职称档次，然后由地、县科协等部门，对他们进行考试、审查，各方面达到规定要求后，再发给职称证书。这些“土秀才”得到了有关部门的承认，群众更乐于向他们请教。
