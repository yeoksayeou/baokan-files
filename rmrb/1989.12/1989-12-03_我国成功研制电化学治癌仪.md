A new device for cancer treatment—an electrochemical cancer treatment device—has recently passed technical evaluation.

This achievement, developed by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, has attracted the interest of experts.

At the evaluation meeting, experts agreed that this technological achievement is advanced in process, easy to operate, and has stable and reliable performance. It has shown significant clinical efficacy in treating various tumors such as lung, liver, breast, and skin cancers, reaching an advanced level both domestically and internationally. They recommended mass production to facilitate its promotion.

China began research on this technology in 1987. So far, over a hundred hospitals have used this treatment method.

According to relevant sources, over the past year, through follow-up surveys of 431 patients with 19 types of cancer after treatment, this method has shown an overall effectiveness rate of over 90%, with a complete cure rate of nearly 50%. This method is non-toxic and has no side effects. Most patients achieve the treatment goal with just one session.

    我国成功研制电化学治癌仪
    据新华社北京十二月二日电　（记者胡年秋）一种治疗癌症的新仪器——电化学治癌仪，日前通过技术鉴定。
    这项由中国原子能科学研究院研制的成果，引起了专家们的兴趣。
    鉴定会上，专家们认为，这一技术成果工艺先进、操作简便、性能稳定可靠，临床对肺、肝、乳腺、皮肤等多种肿瘤有显著疗效，居国内外先进水平，建议批量生产，以利推广。
    我国从一九八七年起进行这一研究，迄今已有上百家医院使用这一治疗方法。
    据有关方面介绍，近一年多来，通过对四百三十一例患者十九种癌症的治后随访调查，这一方法总有效率达百分之九十以上，完全治愈率近百分之五十。这一方法无毒、无副作用，多数患者只须一次即达治疗目的。
