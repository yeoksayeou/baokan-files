The broad masses of officers and soldiers in the Lanzhou Military Region have not forgotten the hardships endured by the older generation in building the country. They actively assist local governments in caring for retired Red Army veterans in areas where the military is stationed, ensuring that more than ten thousand Red Army veterans spend their twilight years in happiness.

According to investigations, there are currently over 4,000 retired Red Army veterans in the five provinces (autonomous regions) of Northwest China, and more than 6,700 Red Army veterans who were scattered during the war years. Most of them are now in their late seventies or eighties, and many are weak and ill. They face various practical difficulties in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, the Lanzhou Military Region has required its subordinate units to assist local governments in caring for Red Army veterans as a duty that cannot be shirked. The military regions and military sub-regions in various provinces have proactively assisted local civil affairs departments in coordinating local resources to do a good job of caring for the veterans. Leaders of the Shaanxi Military Region led cadres from the headquarters to visit and comfort Red Army veterans in counties and cities where they are concentrated. They have provided nearly 20,000 yuan to help solve difficulties. The Yan'an Military Sub-Region assisted local relevant departments in properly arranging the lives of more than 300 Red Army veterans. Units stationed in northern Shaanxi and Longdong have proactively established contacts with nearby Red Army veterans' homes and honor homes, often organizing officers and soldiers to give haircuts, take photos, and do laundry for the veterans. The military hospital stationed in the Hexi Corridor has the hardships of more than 200 Red Army veterans of the Western Route Army living in the Qilian Mountains at heart, often sending medical teams to their doors.

Recently, the Lanzhou Military Region issued a notice requiring the military to do everything possible to take good care of the Red Army veterans in the areas where they are stationed. Various units have sent personnel to visit them, some sending New Year paintings, others sending grain and oil, expressing their admiration for the older generation in various forms.

    兰州军区协助地方做好优抚工作
    万余老红军安度晚年
    新华社兰州12月29日电（通讯员雷生云、余健）兰州军区广大指战员不忘老一辈创业的艰辛，积极协助地方政府做好部队驻地附近红军老战士的优抚工作，使万余名红军老战士幸福地安度晚年。
    据调查，目前西北五省（区）有退伍老红军4000多人，战争年代散落在当地的老红军6700多人，现在大多数已到古稀之年，体弱多病，在衣食住行等方面存在一些实际困难。为此，兰州军区要求所属部队，把协助地方政府做好红军老战士的优抚工作，当作一项义不容辞的义务。各省军区、军分区主动协助当地民政部门协调地方力量，做好照顾工作。陕西省军区的领导同志带领机关干部，多次到老红军比较集中的县、市，看望慰问老红军，先后拿出近2万元帮助解决困难。延安军分区协助地方有关部门，妥善安排了300多名老红军的生活。驻在陕北、陇东的部队主动与驻地附近的红军敬老院、光荣院建立联系，经常组织干部战士为老红军理发、照相、洗衣服。驻河西走廊的部队医院，把散居在祁连山一带的200多名红军西路军老战士的疾苦装在心里，经常送医上门。
    日前，兰州军区又发出通知，要求部队千方百计照顾好驻地老红军。各部队抽出人员，前往慰问，有的为老红军送年画，有的送粮油，以各种形式表达新一代对老一辈的爱戴。
