Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, December 6th.

	To enable nearly one billion illiterates worldwide to receive education, the United Nations officially announced today that next year will be the "International Literacy Year," and will launch a global campaign for universal education.

	According to statistics from UNESCO, there are nearly one billion adult illiterates in the world, of which two-thirds are women. More seriously, there are over 100 million school-age children in developing countries who cannot attend school. They will join the ranks of the illiterate in the 21st century.

	UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar said at today's meeting that the lack of cultural knowledge seriously hinders people's effective participation in social activities and threatens social progress. He said that in an era of rapid scientific and technological development, popularizing education and raising cultural levels is the foundation for meeting future challenges.

	UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor stated that eliminating illiteracy is the organization's top priority. He called on the international community and other UN organizations to work with UNESCO to advance the global literacy campaign already underway in various countries, especially in the Third World. This campaign includes supporting primary education, training teachers and literacy workers, providing educational opportunities for the disabled and rural women, and increasing the production of textbooks.

    让世界十亿文盲受教育
    联合国宣布明年为国际扫盲年
    新华社联合国12月6日电　（记者雷力利）为使全世界近10亿文盲能受到教育，联合国今天正式宣布明年为“国际扫盲年”，并将发起一场全球性的普及教育运动。
    据联合国教科文组织的统计表明，全世界成年文盲将近10亿，其中妇女占2／3。更为严重的是，仅发展中国家就有1亿多学龄儿童不能就学，他们将在未来的21世纪中加入文盲的行列。
    联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在今天的大会上说，文化知识的缺乏严重阻碍了人们有效地参加社会活动，威胁着社会的进步。他说，在科学技术迅猛发展的时代，普及教育、提高文化水平是迎接未来挑战的基础。
    联合国教科文组织总干事费德里克·马约尔表示，扫盲是该组织的首要任务。他要求国际社会和联合国其它组织与教科文组织加倍努力，推进各国特别是第三世界国家中业已开展的包括支持小学教育、培训教师和扫盲工作人员、为残疾人和广大农村妇女提供接受教育机会和增加课本生产等内容的全球扫盲运动。
