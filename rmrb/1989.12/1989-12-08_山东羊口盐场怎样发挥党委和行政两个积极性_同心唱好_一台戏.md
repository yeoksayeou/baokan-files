The implementation of the manager (general manager) responsibility system raises the question of how to handle the relationship between the party and the administration within an enterprise. Over the past two years, the Shandong Yangkou Salt Field has adopted a system of mutual openness between the party and the administration, thereby activating the enthusiasm of both the party committee and the administrative leadership.

At a recent national conference honoring advanced grassroots party organizations and outstanding party workers, reporter Song Shiqi met with Zhu Peixin, the party secretary of the Shandong Yangkou Salt Field. Zhu shared some of his insights. "You asked why we implemented mutual openness between the party and the administration? The implementation of the manager responsibility system means that the manager makes decisions on production, operations, and major issues, which is a significant change. Faced with this change, how should the enterprise party committee carry out its work, and how should the work of the party committee and the administration be coordinated? The first issue is one of recognition. The purpose of implementing the manager (general manager) responsibility system is to activate the enthusiasm of all parties, not just one side, and certainly not to dampen the enthusiasm of any side. The success of an enterprise is not the responsibility of the manager, deputy managers, or the party secretary alone; it requires close cooperation and joint efforts between the party and the administration. Therefore, after much discussion, we felt that implementing mutual openness between the party and the administration would be beneficial in activating the enthusiasm of all parties, and so we proceeded with it.

"The mutual openness between the party and the administration at the salt field involves the party committee's work being open to the administration, and the administration's work being open to the party committee. The main form of this openness is the joint party-administration meeting. Participants include the manager, deputy managers, party committee members, union chairman, and relevant personnel. Joint meetings are held twice a month in principle, and can be convened at any time in case of special circumstances.

"Will this not violate the principle of the manager responsibility system and create a new situation where the party and the administration are not distinct? No, it will not. First, the content of mutual openness involves major issues of the enterprise, issues that affect the vital interests of every employee, the survival and development of the enterprise, and the implementation of the party's policies and guidelines within the enterprise. It is not that every issue is brought to the joint meeting for discussion. Second, it is merely a deliberative body, providing a basis for the manager's decisions and the party committee's resolutions, but it is not a decision-making body, let alone a leadership body. We do not spend all our time discussing the enterprise's work in general terms or engaging in endless debates about the enterprise's problems. Instead, through this process, we exchange information about the work of the party and the administration, which helps in selecting the optimal solutions to problems.

"To speak of the benefits of implementing mutual openness, based on the past two years of practice, we can summarize at least four or five points. For example, it facilitates mutual understanding between party and administrative leaders, making it easier for them to support each other and work closely together, thereby integrating the work of both sides. It helps to demonstrate the collective effectiveness of the leadership team, ensuring that the manager's decisions and the party committee's resolutions are based on collective wisdom. It enables the party committee to focus on the enterprise's production and operations and the manager's decisions, implementing proactive supervision. Additionally, it provides a platform for party and administrative leaders to communicate their thoughts, avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and suspicions. In summary, we feel that this method works well, and the work of the party committee, the administration, and the relationship between the party and the administration are all quite smooth.

"Take, for example, the labor and personnel system reform that the salt field carried out last autumn. This was a highly policy-oriented task involving a large number of people and presenting significant challenges. If it were decided by one person alone, it would be very difficult to implement in our large enterprise with over 5,000 employees. Manager Zhang Fengyun said that no matter how broad one's knowledge or how strong one's abilities, one cannot be an expert in everything; one cannot handle everything alone and must rely on the collective. Over 40 days, we held 13 joint party-administration meetings, bringing various issues to the meeting and formulating relevant policies based on different situations. Dozens of branch committees and nearly a thousand party members were mobilized, resulting in a very successful reform. Over 600 people were reassigned to the third sector within the field or underwent on-the-job training, and there were no instances of ideological backsliding or entangling the leadership.

"In July of this year, the salt field was upgraded to a national second-class enterprise. Over 3,000 employees had their salaries adjusted or floated, with some receiving a full-level increase, some a half-level adjustment, and nearly 2,000 employees' salaries remaining unchanged. The difficulty of this can be imagined. However, this complex issue was resolved in just four days, and not a single person in the entire field raised any objections regarding the adjustments.

"There are many such examples. The party committee must play a role in ensuring and supervising the enterprise. If it does not understand the manager's intentions or the pulse of production and operations, how can it ensure supervision? By implementing mutual openness, the party committee understands the key aspects of production and operations and various reforms, enabling it to carry out ideological and political work in a more targeted manner. This enriches the content of the party organization's role as a stronghold and makes the party members' exemplary role more concrete.

"You asked about the manager's reaction? Of course, he is pleased. In terms of production and operations, everyone acts as a consultant and offers suggestions, which makes his decisions more scientific and democratic. The manager's decisions reflect the collective wisdom, and everyone will execute them more willingly and diligently, which will inevitably share the manager's burden. The manager sees the power of the party's work within the enterprise and the effect of the combined efforts of the party and the administration, so how could he not support the mutual openness between the party and the administration?

"In the past one or two years, some party workers in enterprises have felt that they cannot hold their heads high. Now everyone's mood is better, but I think that we must not let the secretaries stand tall only to have the managers and general managers bend over. Our managers, whether they are party secretaries or not, are all entrusted by the party organization to be responsible here, all for the sake of improving the enterprise. Since the goal is the same, what reason is there not to cooperate closely? It is for this reason that we always put the overall situation first, prioritize the party's cause, and unite to advance around the survival and development of the enterprise, singing in unison 'one song.'"

    山东羊口盐场怎样发挥党委和行政两个积极性——
    同心唱好“一台戏”
    本报记者　宋世琦
    实行厂长（经理）负责制后，如何处理好企业中党政之间的关系？山东省羊口盐场近两年实行党政工作双方公开的制度，调动了党委和行政领导两个积极性。
    在不久前召开的全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会上，记者见到山东羊口盐场党委书记祝培信。他向记者谈了自己的一些体会。“你问为什么要实行党政工作双方公开？实行场长负责制，企业的生产经营、重大问题都由场长决策，这是一个大变化。面对这种变化，企业党委如何开展工作，党委和行政两方面的工作怎么协调？这里首先有一个认识问题。实行厂长（经理）负责制，目的是为了调动各个方面的积极性，绝不是调动一个方面的积极性，更不能挫伤哪一方面的积极性。企业要搞好，不是场长、副场长或者党委书记各自的事，而必须党政密切配合、齐心协力。因此，我们讨论来讨论去，觉得实行党政工作双向公开怎么有利于调动各方面的积极性，就这么办了。
    “盐场实行的党政工作双向公开，就是党委的工作向行政公开，行政的工作向党委公开。公开的形式主要是党政联席会。参加会议的有正副场长、党委成员、工会主席及有关人员。联席会议原则上每月召开两次，遇有特殊情况随时召开。
    “这样，会不会违背场长负责制原则，造成新的党政不分呢？不会的。第一，双向公开的内容，都是企业的重大问题，是牵涉到每个职工切身利益，关系到企业生存和发展，也直接影响到党的方针政策在企业贯彻的重大问题，而绝非事事都提交联席会议讨论。第二，它只是一个议事机构，只是为场长的决策和党委的决议提供依据，而不是决策机构，更不是领导机构。我们不是整天在那里泛泛地议论企业的工作，也不是争议不休地讨论企业的问题，而是通过这个程序交流党政两方面工作的情况，有助于选择解决问题的最优方案。
    “要说实行双向公开的好处，从近两年的实践看，起码可以归纳四五条。比如，它有利于党政领导成员相互了解党政两方面的情况，便于互相支持，密切配合，把两者的工作有机地结合起来；有利于体现领导班子的群体效能，使场长的决策和党委的决议建立在集体智慧的基础上；有利于党委紧紧围绕企业的生产经营和场长的决策开展工作，实行超前监督；此外，这也为党政领导成员思想沟通提供了条件，避免一些不必要的误解和猜疑。总之，我们感到用这个办法很顺劲，党委的工作，行政的工作，党政两者的关系，都较顺当。
    “就说去年秋天盐场进行的劳动人事制度改革吧。这是一项政策性很强，涉及人数很多，难度又很大的工作。如果只是一个人决策，在我们这个有5000多名职工的大型企业里也是很难实施的。场长张凤云说，一个人的知识面再广，也不能样样通；能力再强，也不可能一把抓，还是要依靠集体的力量。40天内，我们开了13次党政联席会，把各方面的情况提到联席会上，针对各种情况制定了有关的政策界限。几十个总支（支部）动起来了，近千名党员动起来了，结果，这次改革非常成功。600多人改为从事场内第三产业或在岗培训，没出现思想回潮、纠缠领导的现象。
    “今年7月，盐场升为国家二级企业，全场有3000多人工资升级或浮动，有升一级的、有调半级的、还有近2000人工资不动。其难度可想而知。然而，就是这么复杂的问题，仅仅用了4天时间全部结束，全场竟没有一个人因升级提出意见。
    “这种事例是很多的。党委在企业中要发挥保证监督作用，如果不了解场长的意图，摸不到生产经营的脉搏，怎么保证监督？实行双向公开，党委了解生产经营和各项改革的关键环节，可以更有针对性的进行思想政治工作。这就能使党组织的战斗堡垒作用有了充实的内容，党员的先锋模范作用也更加具体化了。
    “你问我们场长的反映？他当然高兴。在生产经营方面，大家都当参谋、出主意，这就使他的决策建立在更加科学和民主的基础之上；场长的决策集中了大家的智慧，每个人执行起来也会更自觉自愿，尽心尽力，这必然会分担场长肩上的压力。场长看到了企业中党的工作的威力，看到党政工作形成合力产生的效应，他怎能不支持党政工作的双向公开？
    “近一二年，一些企业中的党务工作者总觉得抬不起头来。现在大家心情舒畅了，但我觉得，千万不要书记直起腰了，再让厂长经理们把腰弓下去。我们场长也好，书记也好，都是党组织委托我们在这里负责，都是为了把企业搞好。既然目标是共同的，有什么理由不密切协作？正因为如此，我们总能以大局为重，以党的事业为重，围绕企业的生存和发展团结共进，同心唱好‘一台戏’。”
