Title: In Memory of Jinglin

On December 12th, a farewell ceremony for Comrade Jinglin was held at the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery in Babaoshan. Reflecting on the time during the "First Five-Year Plan" when I worked with Comrade Jinglin at the State Planning Commission, the memories are vivid. The departed friend is gone, and I offer this small poem in remembrance.

	I first met you in your prime,
	Laughing and talking with spirit soaring.
	Your words were wise and eloquent,
	Your heart was kind and sincere.
	Together we dreamed of soaring to the heavens,
	Each experiencing ups and downs over forty years;
	Your grand plan unfinished, you depart first,
	Great deeds will be carried on by others.

	December 13, 1989

    悼景林
    林宗棠
    十二月十二日，于八宝山革命公墓礼堂向景林同志遗体告别。回首“一五”期间在国家计委与景林同志共事的情景，历历在目。故人已去，仅以小诗相送。
    识君当日正华年，
    意气风发笑谈间。
    腹有经纶言侃侃，
    心存忠厚语拳拳。
    同思扶摇九万里，
    各历沉浮四十年；
    宏图未竟君先去，
    伟业自有后人担。
    一九八九年十二月十三日
