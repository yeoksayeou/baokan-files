Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th.

The State Council held its seventh plenary session today. The meeting was presided over by Premier Li Peng. Zhang Se, Director of the State Statistical Bureau, reported on the domestic economic development in 1989, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reported on the current international situation. Premier Li Peng delivered an important speech.

In his speech, Li Peng reviewed the achievements and existing problems of the rectification and deepening of reforms over the past year, analyzed the international situation and our countermeasures, and deployed the main tasks for the coming year.

Li Peng first analyzed the domestic situation. He said that in 1989, we experienced two major changes. The first major change is that the implementation of the rectification and deepening of reforms has achieved initial results, basically achieving the three main goals set at the beginning of the year. These are: controlling the rise in prices, especially in the second half of the year, the rate of increase has decreased month by month, and the annual price increase is expected to be slightly lower than last year; in agriculture, although some regions in our country suffered severe natural disasters, through the efforts of the vast number of farmers and support from all sides, we still managed to achieve a good harvest, with grain production reaching the highest level in history in 1984; from the overall perspective of economic rectification, the contradiction between total supply and total demand has been alleviated, the scale of fixed asset investment has been controlled, consumption demand has decreased, currency issuance has been controlled, and the main proportionate relationships have improved, with the overall national economy developing in a good direction. The second major change is that in the spring and summer of this year, we suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, defended the leadership of our Party, defended the socialist system, and defended the People's Republic of China. From both historical and current international and domestic perspectives, our decisive measures to suppress this riot are completely correct.

Li Peng said that while we see our achievements, we must also be soberly aware of the remaining problems and find ways to solve them. He said that to overcome the current economic difficulties, we must focus on three main aspects. First, while adjusting the industrial structure, we must focus on adjusting the product structure of enterprises. Currently, some products are sluggish in the market, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for enterprises. Enterprises should seize this opportunity, turning pressure into motivation, actively adjusting their product structure. Relevant departments and financial institutions should also help these enterprises to excavate and transform, so as to produce marketable products and revitalize the enterprises. Second, we must do a good job in financial work. In terms of finance and credit, we must continue the "tight" policy, strictly controlling the issuance of currency and the scale of loans, while also making the use of funds more timely and flexible. We must learn to use financial tools for macro-control, serving the economic operation mechanism that combines planning with market regulation. Third, we must further play the role of state-owned commerce as the main channel and "reservoir." All levels of commercial departments should work hard to smooth out the circulation links, organize necessary product purchases, reduce the accumulation of enterprise products, open up and activate the market, and increase currency circulation.

After analyzing the current international situation, Li Peng said that in foreign relations, we will adhere to the independent and peaceful foreign policy, willing to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Regardless of what happens in other countries, we will always adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other parties, respecting the choices of other peoples. Regardless of how the international situation changes, we must firmly hold our beliefs, adhere to the socialist direction, and adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, and do a solid job in our own work.

Li Peng put forward requirements for the main tasks of the coming year. He said that strengthening rectification and deepening reforms to make the national economy gradually move towards a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development is the overall requirement. He proposed that the national economy should have an appropriate growth rate next year. This year, we must prepare for the production of the first quarter of next year, striving to start from the first quarter to have an industrial production speed that is somewhat higher than the current level, creating a better condition for the whole year's production. Li Peng said that next year, we must continue to control inflation while implementing some necessary reform measures. Regarding agricultural production, Li Peng said that this year has had a good start, and next year, we must mobilize all forces to support agriculture, further stimulate the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers, and strive for a good harvest in agriculture, breaking the stalemate that has lasted for many years. Li Peng said that in terms of the overall economic work, we must continue to reduce the scale of fixed asset investment and consumption demand, control the total balance, and increase macro-control capabilities. To solve major production problems in a timely manner, Li Peng announced that the State Council has decided to establish a Production Committee, with the office set up in the State Planning Commission, and requires local governments and departments to also strengthen the coordination of production. Li Peng particularly pointed out that for enterprises with stagnant or semi-stagnant products, we must help them overcome difficulties, and for those who are unemployed, we must provide basic living guarantees. When talking about deepening reform measures, Li Peng said that the reform measures that have already been introduced, such as the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, the enterprise contract responsibility system, the department contract responsibility system, the local financial contract system, as well as policies for private and individual businesses, policies for coastal areas and special economic zones, etc., should all continue to be implemented. Of course, we should also combine the actual situation, deepen, improve, supplement, and adjust, but not make major changes, maintaining relative stability. Li Peng said that there are many aspects of work next year, education should be strengthened, science and technology should be developed, and the fight against corruption and the construction of clean government should be carried out unremittingly, etc. Local governments and departments should arrange their work according to the above spirit.

Li Peng finally said that a new year is about to begin. He hoped that all levels of cadres would, in the new year, earnestly implement the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Party's Thirteenth Central Committee, achieve new successes in rectification and deepening of reforms, and make new progress in spiritual civilization construction.

Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun, Wu Xueqian, Li Tieying, Qin Jiwei, Song Jian, Wang Fang, Zhou Jiaxuan, Li Guixian, Chen Xitong, Chen Junsheng, Ding Guanggen, and other comrades attended the meeting.

    国务院全会通报国内外形势
    李鹏总理在会上作重要讲话
    治理整顿、深化改革已经取得初步成效，平息北京发生的反革命暴乱完全正确；不管国际风云如何变幻，我们都要坚持社会主义方向，坚持改革开放；明年工作总的要求是加强治理整顿、进一步深化改革，使国民经济逐步走上持续、稳定、协调发展的道路，国民经济要有一个适当的增长速度
    新华社北京12月27日电　（记者孙本尧）国务院今天举行第七次全体会议。会议由国务院总理李鹏主持。国家统计局长张塞通报了1989年国内经济发展情况，外交部长钱其琛通报了当前的国际形势，李鹏总理作了重要讲话。
    李鹏在讲话中回顾了一年来治理整顿、深化改革工作取得的成效和当前存在的问题，分析了国际形势和我们的对策，部署了明年的主要工作。
    李鹏首先分析了国内形势。他说，在1989年我们经历了两个大的变化。第一个大的变化是贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针已经取得初步成效，基本上达到了年初提出的三项主要目标。这就是物价涨势得到了控制，特别是下半年以来，增涨幅度逐月下降，从全年预计物价上涨幅度可略低于去年；在农业方面，虽然我国部分地区遭受了严重的自然灾害，但经过广大农民的努力和各方面的支援，仍然争取到了一个好的收成，粮食产量达到了1984年的历史最好水平；从整个国民经济的治理上看，总供给与总需求的矛盾有所缓解，基本建设规模有所控制，消费需求有所下降，货币发行已经得到控制，主要比例关系有所改善，整个国民经济正朝着好的方向发展。第二个大的变化是在今年春夏之交我们平息了在北京发生的反革命暴乱，捍卫了我们党的领导，捍卫了社会主义制度，捍卫了中华人民共和国。这无论从历史的角度看还是从国际国内的现实分析，我们采取坚决措施平息这场暴乱都是完全正确的。
    李鹏说，在看到我们取得成绩的同时，一定要清醒地看到仍然存在的问题，找出解决问题的办法。他说，克服当前经济上的困难，要抓住三个主要环节。第一，在进行产业结构调整的同时，重点抓好企业产品结构的调整。现在，一些产品在市场销售上出现疲软，这对企业既是一种困难，也是一种机遇，企业要抓住这个机会，变压力为动力，自觉地主动地调整产品结构，各有关部门和金融单位也要帮助这些企业进行挖潜改造，以便生产适销对路的产品，把企业搞活。第二，要把金融工作作好，在财政和信贷方面，我们还要坚持“双紧”的方针，严格控制货币发行量和贷款规模，同时也要把资金运用得更适时、更灵活，要学会运用金融这一重要的经济手段进行宏观调节，使之服务于计划经济与市场调节相结合的经济运行机制。第三，要进一步发挥国营商业的主渠道作用和“蓄水池”作用。各级商业部门要努力打通流通环节，组织必要的产品收购，减少企业的产品积压，开拓和活跃市场，增加货币回笼。
    李鹏具体分析了当前国际形势之后说，在对外关系上我们要坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上和世界上一切国家发展友好合作关系。不管别的国家发生了什么事情，我们始终坚持不干涉别国内政，不干涉别党内部事务的原则，尊重别国人民自己的选择。不管国际上如何风云变幻，我们都要坚定自己的信念，坚持社会主义的方向，坚持改革开放政策，扎扎实实搞好自己的工作。
    李鹏在会上对明年的主要工作提出了要求，他说，加强治理整顿、进一步深化改革，使国民经济逐步走上持续、稳定、协调发展的道路，这是总的要求。他提出明年国民经济要有一个适当的增长速度。今年要为明年一季度的生产做好准备，力争从一季度开始工业生产速度比现在有所回升，为全年的生产创造一个较好的条件。李鹏说，明年要继续控制通货膨胀，同时要实施一些必要的改革措施。关于农业生产，李鹏说，今年有了一个好的开端，明年还要动员各方面的力量支援农业，进一步调动广大农民的积极性，争取农业的好收成，打破多年来的徘徊局面。李鹏说，就整个经济工作来说，我们还要继续压缩基建规模和消费需求，控制总量平衡，增加宏观调控能力。为了及时解决生产中的重大问题，李鹏宣布国务院已决定成立生产委员会，办事机构设在计委，并要求各地方、各部门也要加强对生产的调度协调工作。李鹏特别指出，对那些产品滞销、停产半停产的企业要帮助他们渡过困难，对那些停工待业人员的生活要给予基本的保障。在谈到深化改革的措施时，李鹏说，过去已经出台的改革措施，如农村的家庭联产承包责任制，企业承包经营责任制和部门承包责任制，地方财政包干办法，以及对私营和个体经营的政策，对沿海地区和特区的政策等等，都要继续执行。当然，也要结合现实的情况，进行深化、完善、补充和调整，但不做大的变动，保持相对的稳定性。李鹏说，明年的工作还有很多方面，教育要加强，科技要发展，反腐败斗争和廉政建设要坚持不懈地进行下去，等等。各地方各部门要按照上述精神把自己的工作安排好。
    李鹏最后说，新的一年就要到了，希望各级干部在新的一年里认真贯彻党的四中全会、五中全会精神，使治理整顿、深化改革取得新的成功，使精神文明建设取得新的进展。
    姚依林、田纪云、吴学谦、李铁映、秦基伟、宋健、王芳、邹家华、李贵鲜、陈希同、陈俊生、丁关根等同志出席了会议。
