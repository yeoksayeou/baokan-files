The time for buying cabbages once a year is here, and the staff at the Duck's Beak Vegetable Market in my district have, as always, timely delivered cabbages to me. Master Yang Wenguang not only pushed the cart to deliver the vegetables but also helped this 80-something-year-old person carry the vegetables into the house and stack them neatly. He only cares about delivering the vegetables and does not drink tea or smoke. As long as we are happy, he feels he has fulfilled his duty.

Recently, when I enjoyed the delicious cabbage, I couldn't help but think of Master Yang's spirit of delivering vegetables without expecting rewards and providing thoughtful service. This matter seems small but reflects the new spirit on the commercial front.

    吃菜想起送菜人
    一年一度的买大白菜时节来到后，我区鸭子嘴蔬菜门市部的师傅们一如既往，今年又及时给我送来大白菜。杨文广师傅不但推车送菜，还帮我这80多岁的老人把菜搬到屋内，码放好。他只管送菜，不喝茶、不吸烟，只要我们高兴，他就感到尽了职责。
    最近，当我吃到可口的大白菜时，不由想到杨师傅送菜时那种不计报酬、服务周到的精神。这件事看来并不大，却反映了商业战线上的新风。
