An official from the private representative office of Prince Sihanouk in Cambodia and Asia, based in Bangkok, said tonight that the Sihanouk National Army recently achieved new victories in the battles in Battambang, Otdar Meanchey, and Pursat provinces in Cambodia.

On December 22, the Sihanouk National Army, the National United Front of Cambodia, and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea jointly launched an attack on enemy strongholds along the 5th National Highway from Phnom Sruoch to Battambang, capturing five enemy strongholds and destroying five bridges.

At the same time, the combined forces of the three parties also launched an attack on enemy strongholds along the 6th National Highway in the northeastern part of Phnom Sruoch. After two hours of fighting, two of the strongholds were destroyed. In this battle, 35 enemy soldiers were killed and more than 50 were injured.

In the Otdar Meanchey battlefield, since December 18, the Sihanouk National Army has intensified attacks on enemy strongholds in the province. So far, eight strongholds have been destroyed by the National Army. Kambong, Kouk Bov, Kbaos, and the provincial capital of Samrong are all surrounded by the National Army, and Samrong is currently under artillery fire from Cambodian resistance forces.

According to reports, on December 20, four enemy transport vehicles leaving Samrong were attacked by anti-tank mines set by the National Army, resulting in the destruction of one truck and the death of all soldiers on board. The day before, the National Army ambushed three armored personnel carriers loaded with 60 soldiers traveling from Samrong to Kambong, destroying one and forcing the other two to retreat back to Samrong.

The Sihanouk National Army also achieved some victories in the Pursat battlefield. The 6th National Highway from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap has been paralyzed since November 25. The National Army has destroyed 13 bridges on the 6th National Highway within 10 kilometers of the provincial capital of Pursat. By December 11, the Sihanouk National Army had destroyed six enemy strongholds along the 6th National Highway.

    新华社曼谷12月24日电  据设在曼谷的西哈努克亲王驻柬埔寨和亚洲私人代表处官员今天晚上在这里说，最近西哈努克民族军在柬埔寨马德望奥多棉吉和磅同省的战场上取得了新的胜利。
    本月22日，西哈努克民族军、柬埔寨人民民族解放阵线和民主柬埔寨国民军联合向盘踞在由诗梳风到马德望的5号公路上的敌军据点发动进攻，拔掉敌军据点5个，并摧毁5座桥梁。
    同时，上述三方联合部队还向坐落在诗梳风东北部的6号公路的敌军据点发起进攻，经过2小时的战斗，摧毁了其中的两个据点。在这次战斗中，有35名敌军被打死，50多名被打伤。
    在奥多棉吉省战场，自从本月18日以来，西哈努克民族军加紧向驻扎在该省的敌军据点发动进攻。目前，8个据点已被民族军摧毁，考蒙、考克布、克巴索以及省会三隆都处于民族军的包围之中，三隆正遭到柬抵抗力量的炮击。
    据报道，本月20日4辆敌军运输车从三隆开出后遭到民族军埋设的反坦克地雷的袭击，其中有一辆卡车被炸毁，车上的士兵都被炸死。在前一天，民族军伏击了3辆从三隆开往考蒙的满载60名士兵的装甲运兵车，其中有一辆被摧毁，其余两辆又逃回三隆。
    西哈努克民族军在磅同省战场也取得一些战果。从金边至暹粒的6号公路自11月25日以来一直处于瘫痪状态。民族军已炸毁了仅距磅同省会磅同市10公里的6号公路上的13座桥梁。截至到本月11日，西哈努克民族军已摧毁6个盘踞在6号公路上的敌军据点。
