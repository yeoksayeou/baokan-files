In Beijing, some people know about a bakery run by a Taiwanese businessperson on Chongwenmen Nei Street. The bakery specializes in fresh bread, custom-made cakes, and aromatic coffee and fast food. On a winter day, the reporter interviewed the owner of the bakery, Ms. Li Jingyan, a Taiwanese.

The conversation began with a photo published in the *Hainan Daily* showing Ms. Li with Hainan heroes. She talked about her experiences investing in Hainan. As early as 1983, when relations across the Taiwan Strait were just beginning to thaw, this far-sighted Taiwanese businessperson came to Hainan to conduct surveys, planning to invest in the development of this island with great potential. Since 1984, according to relevant national regulations, Ms. Li has successively purchased over 20,000 square meters of land in Haikou, Sanya, and other places for development and operation, investing a total of 20 million yuan. She has already built office buildings and dormitories on the wasteland, laid communication cables, and a 20-story Taiwan Hotel is about to be constructed. Additionally, the construction of the Sun Moon Lake Resort is in the planning stages. As the first Taiwanese to invest in Hainan real estate, Ms. Li's boldness and determination have boosted the confidence of later investors. Risk and reward often go hand in hand. Ms. Li initially acquired prime development areas at very favorable conditions, making later investors envious.

Daring to take risks indicates the investor's confidence. The reporter asked Ms. Li where her confidence in investing in the mainland comes from. She smiled and replied, "Firstly, the mainland is a huge market, very worthy of investment, which is an undeniable fact. More importantly, people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are descendants of the Yellow Emperor. I feel that Taiwanese investing in the mainland has a greater sense of security and closeness. When I first came to the mainland, I was unfamiliar with the place, but whenever I encountered difficulties, mainland compatriots were always enthusiastic in helping me, leaving a deep impression on me. Although there are some inconveniences in daily life and the efficiency of handling specific small matters is not high enough, I truly feel that the mainland is the best place for Taiwanese to invest. Take this small bakery of mine, for example. It only started trial operations last year, but because of its unique operations, it has made a small profit. I plan to open several more branches in the city, and the locations have all been purchased. They will open successively next year. Now, some Taiwanese still have a wait-and-see attitude towards investing in the mainland, but I believe that the mainland's reform and opening-up policy will not change, and my investment confidence will not waver."

Ms. Li told the reporter that she spent the summer in Beijing. At that time, many Taiwanese overseas were misled by rumors and called Beijing repeatedly, insisting on speaking to her personally. Ms. Li repeatedly told them the true situation in Beijing. Some Taiwanese who wanted to invest in the mainland were even more eager to verify the facts. After hearing Ms. Li's accurate "intelligence," they had a clearer understanding. Soon, Ms. Li made a surprising move in Beijing—she invested in the Beijing real estate industry, using facts to boost Taiwanese confidence in investing in the mainland. This year, Beijing needed to renovate some urban streets for the 11th Asian Games, but was temporarily short of funds. For this reason, Ms. Li signed a joint venture contract with the Beijing Real Estate Development Company to renovate Andingmenwai Street, with both parties investing tens of millions of yuan. The first phase of the renovation project covers 36,000 square meters. Investing in real estate is a significant undertaking both domestically and internationally. It can be said that Ms. Li has played a certain role in reigniting the investment fever in the mainland among Taiwanese.

Recently, Ms. Li also donated 100,000 yuan to the Asian Games Organizing Committee in her personal capacity. She said, "Every Chinese person hopes that the Asian Games will be a success, which will be a source of pride for all Chinese people." A compatriot who grew up in Taiwan can speak such touching words from the heart, which cannot help but make the reporter feel respect. Ms. Li's contributions are not just the huge investments and donations, but also a burning Chinese heart!

    一颗炽热的“中国心”
    ——访投资大陆的台胞李京燕小姐
    本报记者　王继晟
    在北京，一定有人知道崇文门内大街有家台商开的阿里山饼屋，那里专门出售新鲜的面包，为顾客订做可口漂亮的蛋糕，还供应浓香的咖啡和快餐。初冬的一天，记者采访了饼屋主人——台胞李京燕小姐。
    话题是从《海南日报》刊登的李小姐和海南英模相聚的彩照开始的。她谈起了投资开发海南的前前后后。早在1983年，海峡两岸的关系刚有些解冻，这位颇有远见的台商就来到海南考察，准备投资开发这富有潜力的岛屿。1984年以来，依照国家有关法规，李小姐先后在海口、三亚和其它地方，购置了20000多平方米的土地，进行开发经营，共投资2000万元人民币。现已在荒地上建起了办公楼和宿舍楼，铺设了通讯电缆，一座20多层的台湾饭店也将拔地而起，此外，日月潭度假村正在筹建中。作为第一位投资海南房产地的台商，李小姐的果敢和魄力，增强了后来者的投资信心。风险同收益常常结伴而行，李小姐当时以很优惠的条件，选购了开发区位置极佳的地界，令后来者好生羡慕。
    敢冒风险，说明投资者具有信心。记者请李小姐谈谈投资大陆的信心从何而来。她笑答：“首先大陆是个极大的市场，很值得投资，这是不争的事实。更重要的是，海峡两岸的中国人同是炎黄子孙，我觉得台商投资大陆比去其它地区投资有更大的安全感和亲近感。我初到大陆时，人生地不熟，可每逢困难，大陆同胞总是热情相助，至今印象很深。尽管生活上有点不习惯，办一些具体的小事效率还不够高，但我确实感到大陆是台商最佳的投资地。就说我这间小小的饼屋吧，去年才开始试营业，因为经营有特色，小有盈余。我准备在城区再开几家分店，扩大生意的地方都买好了，明年将陆续开业。现在，有些台商对来大陆投资还抱观望态度，可我相信大陆的改革开放政策不会变，我的投资信心也不会发生动摇。”
    李小姐告诉记者，今年夏天她是在北京度过的，当时许多台胞在海外被传言所惑，纷纷打电话到北京，非要她本人接电话不可。李小姐一遍又一遍地告诉他们北京的真实情况。有些想来大陆投资的台胞更是急于打探虚实，听了李小姐的准确“情报”，心里有底了。不久，李京燕小姐在北京做出惊人之举——投资北京房地产业，用事实增强了台商投资大陆的信心。今年，北京市为举办第十一届亚运会，需要改造部分城市街道，一时苦于资金短缺。为此，李小姐和北京市房地产开发公司签署了合资开发改造安定门外大街的合同，双方各投资数千万元，第一期改造工程为36000平方米。投资房地产，在国内外都是非同小可的事业。可以说，台湾重燃大陆投资热，李小姐确实起了一定的影响作用。
    不久前，李小姐又以个人名义向亚运会筹委会捐款10万元。她说：“每一个中国人都希望亚运会能举办成功，那将是所有中国人的骄傲。”一位生长在台湾的同胞，能讲出如此感人的肺腑之言，不禁使记者顿生敬意。李小姐付出的不仅仅是巨额投资和捐款，更是一颗炽热的中国心！
