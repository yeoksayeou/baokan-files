300,000 copies of the beautifully bound "Selected Diary of Lei Feng" are being sent to the entire military. This is a publication compiled by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army to initiate a new wave of learning from Comrade Lei Feng across the entire military.

In 1963, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yun all wrote inscriptions. Lei Feng's name was etched into the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. In August of this year, General Yang Baibing, the Director of the General Political Department, visited the unit where Lei Feng had served and required the entire military to deeply and persistently carry out activities to learn from Comrade Lei Feng, ensuring that the spirit of Lei Feng is passed down from generation to generation. He pointed out that the spirit of Lei Feng is our military's advantage. In the new situation, we must further carry forward and develop the spirit of Lei Feng, guiding cadres and soldiers to establish a firm communist ideal and belief, and to wholeheartedly serve the people. Based on Yang Baibing's suggestion, relevant departments of the General Political Department compiled this book, "Selected Diary of Lei Feng."

The newly published "Selected Diary of Lei Feng" strictly adheres to the original work of Comrade Lei Feng, and is arranged according to the four aspects of Premier Zhou Enlai's inscription, fully and truly reflecting the thought development trajectory of Lei Feng from an ordinary youth to a great communist warrior. This book includes Yang Baibing's speech at Lei Feng's former unit as a preface. It is a vivid textbook for educating the entire military in having ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

    总政号召全军
    掀起学习雷锋新热潮
    30万册《雷锋日记选》陆续发往部队
    据新华社北京12月8日电  30万册装帧精美的《雷锋日记选》正陆续发往全军。这是人民解放军总政治部为在全军掀起新的向雷锋同志学习的热潮而编印的。
    1963年，毛泽东同志发出“向雷锋同志学习”的号召，刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、邓小平、陈云等老一辈无产阶级革命家也都题词，雷锋的名字镌入了亿万人民的心灵。今年8月，总政治部主任杨白冰上将视察雷锋生前所在团时，要求全军深入持久地开展向雷锋同志学习的活动，让雷锋精神代代相传。他指出，雷锋精神是我们军队的优势。在新的形势下，要把雷锋精神更加发扬光大，引导干部战士像雷锋那样树立坚定的共产主义理想和信念，全心全意为人民服务。根据杨白冰同志的建议，总政治部有关部门编印了这本《雷锋日记选》。
    新印发的《雷锋日记选》，严格忠实于雷锋同志的原作，按照周恩来总理的题词，分4个方面的内容编排，全面而真实地反映了雷锋由一位普通青年成长为伟大的共产主义战士的思想发展轨迹。这本书把杨白冰同志在雷锋生前所在团讲的话作为代序言。它是对全军官兵进行有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律教育的生动教材。
