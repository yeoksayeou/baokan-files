The British are renowned worldwide for their enthusiasm for horse racing, with most races involving betting. A major horse race can attract tens of thousands of spectators, with total bets reaching several million, even up to a thousand million pounds. However, in recent years, strange incidents have frequently occurred at racecourses—favorite horses often either "stumble" mid-race, or seem distracted and unwilling to "strive for victory," or appear inexplicably "anxious"...

Initially, horse racing enthusiasts attributed these incidents to the occasional mistakes of excellent horses. However, as the frequency of such incidents increased, people began to feel confused and angry...

Experts and police conducted thorough investigations and research into these "abnormal situations" and discovered that a number of "speculators" were using ultrasonic oscillators to interfere with the nervous systems of racing horses, thereby achieving their sinister betting goals! Experts confirmed that these oscillators are often installed in spectator binoculars; the emitted frequency is above 20 kilohertz, exceeding the limit of human auditory perception, thus affecting only the horses (horses can hear high-frequency sounds that humans cannot), while the jockeys and other spectators remain unaware. This "cheating device" not only emits fine and powerful ultrasonic waves but can also accurately target any horse on the racecourse, causing it to momentarily lose control or make mistakes...

Additionally, obtaining such devices is incredibly easy. They can be found in home security systems, electronic rodent repellents, and mechanical scarecrows, costing very little.

Because this form of cheating is so "simple and convenient," the number of cheaters is increasing daily. Experts point out that this scandal at British racecourses is no different from athletes using banned substances in competition.

    赛马场上怪事多
    唐若水
    英国人素以热衷于赛马运动而著称于世，多数赛马是赌博，一次大型赛马往往可以吸引数万名观众，投下的赌注总额可高达几百万，甚至上千万英镑。但近些年来，赛马场上频频出现怪事——被大家普遍看好的优秀赛马常常在比赛途中或“马失前蹄”，或因精神不集中而不愿“力争上游”，或无缘无故地显得“惶惶然”……赛马爱好者开头还以为此系优秀赛马的“偶尔失手”，但次数多了人们便开始感到困惑和愤怒……
    专家和警察对这些“反常情况”作了周密的调查和研究，结果发现，为数不少的“投机分子”利用一种超声波振荡器干扰奔跑中赛马的神经系统，从而达到有利于自己赌博的阴险目的！专家们证实：这种振荡器往往被安装在观赛用的望远镜中；发出的声频高于20千赫，超过了人耳听觉的感应极限，因而仅对赛马起作用（马耳能听到人耳听不到的高频音），但骑马师和其他观众毫无觉察；这种“传感器”的“作弊武器”，不仅可射出又细又强的超声波，而且可以异常准确地射向赛马场任何一匹赛马的头颅，令其在一瞬间出现动作失调或失误……此外，要弄到这种小玩意也易如反掌，家用保安装置、电子驱鼠器、机器稻草人中都有，费用极少。
    正因为这种作弊“简单易行”，作弊者便呈与日俱增之势。行家们指出，英国赛马场上的这件丑闻与运动员服用违禁药物参赛并无二致。
