The Red Cross Society of North Korea reiterates hope for mutual visits between separated families in the North and South.

		Pyeongyang, December 8 (Xinhua) - The spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Red Cross Society of North Korea issued a statement on the 7th, reiterating the hope for mutual visits between separated families and artistic troupes in the North and South.

		The statement expressed regret that the mutual visits of separated families and artistic troupes could not be realized this year. The statement suggested that the 8th round of Red Cross representatives' contact should be held on January 22.

		In the past 7 rounds of North-South representatives' contacts, consensus has been reached on the time and number of people for the mutual dispatch of hometown visit teams and artistic troupes of separated families. However, there are serious disagreements between the two sides on the content of the artistic performances. The South Korean representatives opposed the North Korean performance of the famous operas "The Flower Girl" or "Sea of Blood" in Seoul, causing the originally scheduled mutual dispatch of artistic troupes and hometown visit teams on December 8 to be postponed.

    朝鲜红十字会重申
    希望实现北南方离散家属互访
    新华社平壤12月8日电  朝鲜红十字会中央委员会发言人7日发表声明，重申希望实现北南方离散家属和艺术团的互访。
    这份声明对未能实现年内离散家属和艺术团的互访表示遗憾。声明中建议1月22日进行第8次红十字会代表接触。
    在过去的7次北南方代表接触中，已就离散家属故乡访问团和艺术团的互派时间和人数问题达成了一致意见。但是，双方在艺术团的演出内容上意见严重对立。南方代表反对北方去汉城演出著名歌剧《卖花姑娘》或《血海》，致使原定12月8日互派艺术团和故乡访问团的计划搁浅。
