Both Material and Spiritual Investments Are Emphasized: Zhejiang Strengthens Rural Ideological Education and Promotes Patriotism, Collectivism, and Self-Reliance

    Reporter Gao Haihao reports from Hangzhou: To achieve a new breakthrough in agriculture, Zhejiang Province has, while strengthening investments in funds, materials, and technology, emphasized another type of investment: leveraging traditional political advantages to launch a campaign in rural areas across the province. The campaign focuses on promoting patriotism, collectivism, and self-reliance, continuously consolidating and developing the favorable environment for revitalizing agriculture.

    This measure, dubbed "spiritual investment," has already shown its unique role in Zhejiang's rural areas this year as they faced unprecedented natural disasters. Due to consecutive typhoons and floods, large areas of the province were affected. The provincial Party Committee and government promptly mobilized rural cadres and Communist Party members to lead the people in disaster relief and recovery, restoring production. Wherever the situation was most difficult, there were cadres and party members, fully demonstrating the Party's political advantages and helping the severely affected agricultural production to rise again: early rice production increased compared to last year, and autumn grain also had a bumper harvest.

    Recently, the leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and government have repeatedly reminded cadres at all levels: in recent years, the agricultural foundation has been somewhat weakened, partly due to shortages in funds, materials, and technological investments, and partly due to various new problems in rural ideological conditions. Therefore, strengthening the agricultural foundation must be done with "two hands," both material investments and "spiritual investments."

    To achieve agricultural success, Zhejiang Province has been continuously increasing investments in funds, materials, technology, and strengthening village-level economies. The Provincial Party Committee and government have also decided: starting this year, various lively and vibrant forms will be adopted across the province to, through positive education and guidance, promote national consciousness, collective consciousness, planning consciousness, and the spirit of self-reliance and hard work in rural areas. At the same time, the focus will be on training leading cadres at the township and village levels and all party members, combining this with democratic appraisal of party members, fully playing the role of rural party organizations as fortresses; combining ideological education and national conditions education with promoting the deepening of rural reforms and actual work such as winter planting, basic farmland construction, land management, and family planning.

    News from five pilot counties (cities) indicates that implementing this "spiritual investment" has, in a short time, initially formed a good atmosphere for solving some prominent problems in rural areas. Some have resolved long-overdue land contract payments; some have increased planting areas and launched large-scale water conservancy projects; others have improved and strengthened the relationship between cadres, party members, and the masses, with notable effects.

    既抓物质投入　也抓精神投入
    浙江加强农村思想教育
    大力弘扬爱国主义、集体主义和自力更生精神
    本报杭州12月14日电　记者高海浩报道：围绕实现农业新突破，浙江省在强化资金、物资和科技投入的同时，突出强调另一种投入：发挥传统政治优势，在全省农村兴起以弘扬爱国主义、集体主义和自力更生精神为主题的教育，不断巩固和发展重振农业的大气候。
    这种被称为“精神投入”的兴农举措，在今年浙江农村迎战罕见的自然灾害中业已显示其特殊作用。由于连续遭受台风和洪涝袭击，全省农村大面积受灾。省委、省政府及时动员农村广大干部和共产党员身先士卒，拚搏在前，带领群众抗灾抢险，恢复生产，哪里最困难，哪里就有干部党员，充分体现了党的政治优势，促使遭受重创的农业生产顽强崛起：早稻比去年增产，秋粮也获丰收。
    浙江省委、省政府领导最近一再提醒各级干部：前些年农业基础有所削弱，一是资金、物资、科技投入短缺，二是农村思想状况面临诸多新问题。因此强化农业基础必须“两手抓”，既抓物质投入，也抓“精神投入”。
    为了夺取农业丰收，浙江省已在资金、物资、科技和增强村级经济等方面不断增加投入。省委、省政府同时决定：从今年起，全省各地要采取各种生动活泼的形式，通过正面教育引导，在农村弘扬国家观念、集体观念、计划观念和自力更生、艰苦奋斗精神。同时，把重点培训乡、村两级领导班子成员和全体党员，与开展民主评议党员结合起来，充分发挥农村党组织的战斗堡垒作用；把思想教育、国情教育与推动农村改革深化和冬种、农田基本建设、土地管理、计划生育等实际工作结合起来。
    来自5个试点县（市）的消息说，实施这次“精神投入”，在不长的时间里，初步形成了解决农村一些突出问题的良好氛围。有的解决了多年拖欠的土地承包款的收缴；有的增加了种植面积和大兴水利建设；也有的密切和改善了干部、党员与群众的关系，颇有成效。
