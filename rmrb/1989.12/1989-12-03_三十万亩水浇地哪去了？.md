Recently, Zhengzhou City in Henan Province conducted a comprehensive survey of its water conservancy facilities and irrigation areas. The results were shocking: by the end of 1988, the effective irrigated area in the six counties and six districts under the city's jurisdiction was 2.65 million mu, but now it has decreased to 2.333 million mu, a reduction of nearly 320,000 mu in less than a year. People cannot help but ask: where did so much irrigated land go?

Non-agricultural Land Use, from Encroachment to Devouring

The rapid development of township enterprises has taken up arable land; the increasing population has led to the conversion of many arable lands into residential plots; the expanding and multiplying government buildings are major land users; mining, road construction, and other activities have also resulted in the disappearance of large tracts of farmland. In Gongxian County, the per capita arable land is less than one mu, and most of it is on slopes and hills. One would think that arable land here should be extremely precious, but in less than a year, the county has reduced its effective irrigated area by nearly 100,000 mu. Just one town, Xiaoyi, has taken up 5,050 mu, which is among the few fields in the county that are guaranteed to produce crops regardless of drought or flood. In Mixin County, numerous large and small coal mines have taken up 110,000 mu of irrigated land. In Xinzheng County, more than 300 brick kilns have resulted in the loss of 3,000 mu of arable land. The term "residential plots" refers to the use of wasteland, but in reality, it is often good land that is being seized. In Mixin County alone, residential plots have taken up 5,000 mu of land.

Surface Water Pollution, Groundwater Over-Extraction

With insufficient water sources, groundwater is being exploited in a predatory manner, causing the water table to drop and the funnel areas to expand rapidly, directly affecting the abandonment of agricultural water conservancy projects and the sharp reduction of effective irrigated areas. In Xingyang County, more than 160 paper mills have turned the river water yellow-brown, with alkali bubbles floating on the surface up to one or two chi high. Four medium-sized reservoirs have been so polluted that they can no longer be used for irrigation, and the fish and shrimp in the reservoirs have been almost entirely poisoned to death. Cattle and sheep that wade through the water lose their leg hair. The 45-kilometer-long Shuangjie River in Mixin County is polluted by the six million cubic meters of wastewater discharged by numerous coal mines each year, making it filthy and unfit for use. Not only is the county itself affected, but the downstream counties are also endangered. The county also over-extracts groundwater by 15 million cubic meters each year, with the deepest groundwater level exceeding 30 meters, making the cost of irrigation increasingly high. The Zhuanguan Pumping Station originally cost one yuan to irrigate one mu, but now it costs three to four yuan, with the highest reaching 26 yuan, making it unaffordable for the people. More than 100 pumping stations in the Zhongyuan District on the outskirts of Zhengzhou City can no longer pump water due to over-extraction of groundwater. The severely polluted Jalou River water causes crops to wither as soon as it is used for irrigation, rendering all the pumping stations along the river in Zhongmou County idle. In Gongxian County, the lowering of the groundwater level has rendered the pumping equipment useless, making it difficult for local people and livestock to get water. In Xinzheng County, out of 580 pumping stations, only 300 can still function.

Facilities "Over-Service, Working with Problems"

Most of the agricultural water conservancy facilities here were built in the 1960s and 1970s, with some even dating back to the 1950s, and have been in over-service for a long time. Many pumps, canals, and pipelines have leaks, drips, and other issues, resulting in hardened canals turning into earthen canals and earthen canals being leveled. In Gongxian County, more than 200,000 meters of severely damaged canals account for 30% of the total canal length. The county's 1,800-plus agricultural wells are poorly maintained, and some have even been repurposed for industrial use. Many counties have tens of thousands of mu of irrigated land that cannot be irrigated due to equipment aging and lack of maintenance. Even more worrying is the frequent occurrence of human-caused damage and theft of equipment by lawless elements. Last year, Gongxian County suffered theft, with direct economic losses amounting to 610 million yuan, affecting the irrigation of 103,000 mu of land.

### 三十万亩水浇地哪去了？

    三十万亩水浇地哪去了？
    河南省水利厅　韩培逊
    河南省郑州市前些日子对水利设施及灌溉面积进行了普查，结果令人震惊：该市所属六县六区，一九八八年底有效灌溉面积为二百六十五万亩，现在仅有二百三十三点三万亩，不到一年减少近三十二万亩。人们不禁要问：这么多水浇地哪里去了？
    非农业占地，从蚕食到鲸吞
    乡镇企业迅猛发展占去了耕地；人口的膨胀，建房使许多耕地化为宅基；日渐扩大、增多的机关建房，是占地大户；开矿、修路等，也使大块大块农田不复存在。巩县耕地人均不足一亩，且多在坡面山岭上。按说，耕地在这里该是十分珍贵了吧，可是不到一年，该县减少有效灌溉面积多达近十万亩，仅一个孝义镇就占掉五千零五十亩，且是该县少有的旱涝保收田。密县大小煤矿鳞次栉比，占去水浇地十一万亩。新郑县砖瓦窑三百多个，失去耕地三千亩。宅基地说的是利用荒地，实际上大都是抢占的好地，密县仅宅基就占地五千亩。
    地表水污染，地下水超采
    水源不足，便掠夺性地开采地下水，使水位沉降，漏斗区急剧扩大，直接影响农田水利工程报废，有效灌溉面积锐减。荥阳县的一百六十多家造纸厂，使河水黄褐，水面上浮起的碱泡一二尺高。四座中型水库，有两座污染得不能浇地，库中鱼虾毒死殆尽，牛羊趟过水后，腿毛脱落。密县四十五公里长的双洎河，被众多煤矿每年排出的六千万立方米废水污染得秽浊不堪，不仅本县受害，还危及下游各县。该县每年还超采地下水一千五百万立方米，地下水位最大埋深超过三十米，浇地成本越来越高。赵贵岗提灌站原浇地一亩次一元来钱，现在是三至四元，最高的达二十六元，群众根本浇不起。郑州市郊中原区一百多个提灌站，因地下水超采已抽不出水了。严重污染的贾鲁河水，浇了庄稼即禾苗枯萎，使中牟县沿河的提灌站全都闲置。巩县因地下水位下降，提灌设备废弃无用，当地人畜吃水都很困难。新郑县五百八十处提灌站，能发挥作用的只剩下三百处。
    设施“超期服役，带病工作”
    这里的农田水利设施多建于六七十年代，还有五十年代兴建的，一直在超期服役，不少机泵、渠道跑、冒、滴、漏，千孔百疮，以致硬渠变土渠，土渠夷为平地。巩县损坏严重的渠道有二十多万米，占渠道总长的百分之三十，该县一千八百多眼农用机井，六百多眼无人管护，更有甚者索性把水利设备“农转非”——用到工业上了。不少县都有上万亩水浇地因设备老化失修不能灌溉了。尤为令人忧虑的是，人为的毁坏、不法分子的盗窃设备的事屡有发生。去年巩县被盗，直接经济损失六百一十万元。影响灌溉面积十万三千亩。
