    The National Supervision Work Conference was held in Beijing today. Emphasizing the need to deepen anti-corruption efforts, the conference set this as the key focus for next year's supervision work. This was stated by Emie Jianxing, Minister of the Supervision Department, at the conference.

    It is understood that this year, national supervision departments, in line with the central tasks set by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, have focused on anti-corruption efforts, particularly targeting bribery and embezzlement. They have concentrated their efforts on investigating and prosecuting a number of cases of illegal and disciplinary violations. From January to October, various levels of supervision departments received nearly 490,000 reports from the public, handled 168,700 cases, initiated investigations into 38,908 cases, concluded 36,072 cases, and imposed administrative penalties on 23,777 individuals, including 1,212 county-level and above officials. Additionally, 2,761 cases were transferred to judicial authorities for handling, recovering economic losses valued at 340 million yuan for the state.

    In his report to the conference, Emie Jianxing stated that the anti-corruption efforts have achieved initial results. However, it must be recognized that the anti-corruption environment is just beginning to take shape, and the task remains arduous. There must be no relaxation. Next year, various levels of supervision departments should focus on three key areas in the anti-corruption struggle. First, investigate cases where leading officials use their power for money transactions and illegal gains, such as embezzlement, bribery, abusing power for personal gain, extortion, and dereliction of duty. Second, investigate issues that are of significant public concern, such as using public funds for excessive home renovations, using power for illegal construction of private residences, unit speculation, public-funded travel, and wasteful spending. Third, investigate major cases that have a significant impact on the nation or a region or a department, setting an example to deter others and boost the morale of those fighting corruption.

    Emie Jianxing also discussed the focus areas for next year's supervision departments, which include enforcing the law and supervision around the themes of rectification and deepening reform. The emphasis will be on solving key issues in the four important links of rectification: reducing demand, adjusting structure, rectifying order, and improving efficiency. The focus will be on strengthening centralized and unified efforts, opposing localism, and seriously investigating and prosecuting disciplinary and illegal behaviors that disregard overall interests, fail to follow orders, and disrupt rectification efforts. Supervision departments will also oversee and inspect the implementation of various anti-corruption decisions proposed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, further strengthening the construction of anti-corruption laws and regulations, establishing and improving management constraints, and promoting the development of anti-corruption efforts by combining administrative supervision with public oversight, and top-down supervision with bottom-up oversight.

    全国监察工作会议在京召开
    深入反腐败是明年监察工作重点
    本报北京12月21日讯　记者王行增、舒瑜报道：“明年各级监察机关要继续深入开展反腐败斗争，把这件大事作为重点工作认真抓紧抓好。”这是监察部部长尉健行在今日召开的全国监察工作会议上强调指出的。
    据了解，全国监察机关今年围绕党中央、国务院提出的中心任务，开展了以反贪污受贿为重点的反腐败斗争，集中力量查处了一批违法违纪案件。1至10月，各级监察机关共收到群众举报近49万件次，受理168700件，立案查处38908件，结案36072件，给予行政处分的有23777人，其中县处级以上干部1212人，移送司法机关处理的2761人，为国家挽回经济损失价值人民币3.4亿元。
    尉健行在大会的报告中说，反腐败的斗争已取得了初步成效。但是，必须看到，反腐败的大气候刚刚形成，任务还非常艰巨，不能有任何松懈。明年，各级监察机关要从三个方面重点抓好反腐败斗争。一是查办领导机关、领导干部利用职权搞权钱交易、获取非法利益的案件，如贪污受贿、以权谋私、弄权勒索、渎职失职等；二是查办社会反映强烈、群众关心的热点问题，如用公款超标准装修住房、利用职权违法违纪营建私人住宅、单位投机倒把、公费旅游、挥霍浪费等；三是查办对全国或一个地区、一个部门有重大影响的大案要案，惩一儆百，鼓舞人们反对腐败的信心和斗志。
    尉健行还谈到明年监察机关要围绕治理整顿、深入改革开展执法监察，突出解决治理整顿中的压缩需求、调整结构、整顿秩序、提高效益等四个重要环节中的问题，把着眼点放在加强集中统一、反对分散主义上，对那些只顾局部利益而不顾全局利益、有令不行、有禁不止、干扰治理整顿的违纪违法行为必须严肃查处；要监督检查党中央、国务院提出的各项有关廉政决定的贯彻落实情况，进一步加强廉政法规、制度的建设，建立和健全管理的制约机制，坚持行政监察与群众监督相结合、自上而下的监察与自下而上的监督相结合，进一步促进廉政建设工作的发展。
