Zhang Zhuo, the Party Committee Secretary of Yongquan Township in Yu County, Hebei Province, was elected as a deputy county magistrate during the county's People's Congress in 1982 due to his outstanding work. However, he chose to remain in the township as an official rather than taking up the position of "county magistrate." He was also concerned about the five ungreened hills in Yongquan Township.

Later, the county committee adjusted the leadership team and assigned him to be a member of the county committee and the director of the county committee's organization department, but he politely declined. He said, "Yongquan Township has been included in the greening area around the capital, and we need to plant another 10,000 mu of timber, 10,000 mu of dried fruits, 10,000 mu of fresh fruits, 10,000 mu of pines, and 10,000 mu of grass. Until these five '10,000 mu' are completed, I will not leave Yongquan."

In Shangchen Village of Yongquan Township, there are dense apple orchards everywhere. From a distance, it looks like entering a boundless forest. These are the apple orchards that Zhang Zhuo led the villagers to plant. In 1973, when Zhang Zhuo came to Shangchen Village, it was the poorest village, with a daily wage of less than 4 fen, and it relied on state subsidies every year.

At that time, he walked through the mountain paths every day with a heavy heart. There were no trees on the mountains, and there was no way to make money. How could Shangchen Village become prosperous? On the third day of his arrival, he suddenly discovered a patch of "old man trees" shaking in the cold wind not far from the village entrance. These trees were planted long ago and had never borne fruit. Old Zhang thought, if we don't do something on the mountains, the mountain people have no hope.

A patch of "old man trees" brought him the hope of greenery. He specially invited a fruit tree technician from Shandong to manage the trees scientifically, and they bore fruit that year. Although the apples were not many, each villager got only two, but the villagers had a taste of the sweetness of planting trees. The next year, 30,000 jin of fruit were produced, and the once insignificant fruit trees made a lot of money. The farmers were delighted. He then seized the opportunity to mobilize the villagers to plant another 1,300 mu of fruit trees, quickly reaching an average of 170 trees per person.

Zhang Zhuo's home is not far from Yongquan Township. He has an elderly mother, four young children, and his wife suffers from mental illness. But for the greening of Yongquan, he often stays away from home for several months, or even half a year. Others work two shifts a day, but he works four shifts a day. Before breakfast, he goes to the mountains to inspect, and after dinner, he still checks the site in the dark.

Seventeen years have passed, and Comrade Zhang Zhuo, with his perseverance and pursuit, with the bright and upright heart and selfless dedication of a Communist Party member, has withstood countless winds and rains, and created a green cause in Yongquan Township. Just in Shangchen Village, more than 1,300 mu of fruit trees have been planted. Last year, the village's fruit income per capita reached over 500 yuan, and with other incomes, it exceeded 1,000 yuan.

The villagers will never forget the officials who did good deeds for them. One year, when Zhang Zhuo's family was building a new house, the officials and villagers of Shangchen Village thought they finally had a chance to repay Old Zhang. Some wanted to help with the labor; some wanted to send bricks and tiles; the village officials even brought a cart and money, saying that as long as Old Zhang said the word, they could have anything. But Old Zhang had already made preparations. The cart was already arranged from outside, and the bricks and tiles were already delivered to his home. As for the money, he was afraid to trouble Shangchen Village, so he had already prepared it from his relatives, and Shangchen Village did not need a single brick or tile... Someone asked him why he did this, and he smiled and replied, "I am a Communist Party member and have never thought of asking for any repayment. If everyone sees me building a house and comes to help, you can bear it, but I can't..."

The villagers all praise Zhang Zhuo as a true official who brings benefits to the people.

    一个不愿当县长的乡干部
    ——记河北省蔚县涌泉乡党委书记张铎
    刘芳
    河北省蔚县涌泉乡党委书记张铎，因为工作出色，在1982年县里召开人代会时，被代表们选为副县长。但他放着“县官”不做，非要留在乡里继续当干部不可。他还惦记着涌泉乡五座没有绿化的山头。
    后来，县委调整班子，调他去任县委常委、县委组织部长，他又婉言辞绝。他说：“涌泉乡已被列入首都周围绿化地带，还要再造一万亩用材林、一万亩干果、一万亩鲜果、一万亩松树、一万亩草，不完成这五个‘一万’，我不离开涌泉”。
    在涌泉乡的上陈庄村，到处都是茂密的果树林，远远地望去，犹如进了一片无边的大林海，这些是张铎领着群众亲手栽植起来的苹果林。1973年张铎来到这里时，上陈庄是最穷的村，一个劳动日不到4分钱，年年靠吃国家救济。
    那时，他每天心事重重地在山沟小道上走着，山上没有树，挣钱没有路，上陈庄要致富得从哪里入手呢？在他转到第三天的时候，忽然发现村头不远处有一片“老头树”，在寒风中抖动。原来这些树是很早以前栽种的，从未结过果。老张想，不在山上作文章，山区人就没有希望。
    一片“老头树”给他带来了绿色的希望。他特意从山东请来一位果树技术员，经过科学管理，当年就结了果。结的苹果不多，村里每人仅分得两个，但群众都初步尝到了栽树的甜头。第二年产果3万斤，原先不起眼的果树赚了大钱，农民们乐了。于是他趁热打铁，发动群众又栽了1300多亩果树，很快达到人均170株。
    张铎家离涌泉乡不远，他上有年迈的母亲，下有4个年幼的孩子，老伴又患有精神病。但他为了绿化涌泉，常常是几个月，甚至是半年多不回家。别人一天是两出勤，他是一天四上工。早饭前，他得到山上转一趟，晚饭后还要摸着黑察看一遍现场。
    17年过去了，张铎同志以他的执著和追求，以一个共产党员光明磊落的胸怀和无私奉献，顶住了无数次风风雨雨，在涌泉乡创下了一番绿色的事业。光是上陈庄就栽种果树1300多亩。去年这个村果品收入人均已达500多元，再加上其他收入已超过千元。
    村民们是忘不了那些给他们办好事的干部的。有一年张铎家要盖新房，上陈庄的干部群众以为这回可有了报答老张的机会。有的想给他去帮工；有的想给他送砖瓦；村干部甚至赶来了马车，送来了款，说只要老张一句话，要啥有啥。但老张早有先见之明，马车他已从外地找好，砖瓦早已拉到了家。至于金钱，他怕给上陈庄找麻烦，早从亲戚那里筹备齐全，上陈庄的砖瓦一块都不要……有人问他为啥这样，他笑笑回答：“我是共产党员，从来没有想到要什么报答。如果大家见我盖房都来帮，你们过得去，我可受不了……”
    村里的群众都称赞张铎是真正为民造福的好干部。
