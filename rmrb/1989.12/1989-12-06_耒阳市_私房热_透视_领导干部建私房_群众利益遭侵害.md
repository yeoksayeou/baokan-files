Since 1984, cadres in Leiyang City, Hunan Province, have sparked a wave of building private houses in the urban and suburban areas of the city.

A total of 868 party and government cadres in the city have built private houses. These cadres mainly include:

* Leaders of various departments and bureaus of the municipal government. Leiyang City has 37 departments and bureaus, and 33 of them have leaders involved in building private houses. All four heads of the Municipal Construction Commission have built high-standard private residences. 85% of the staff in the Municipal Construction Commission have built private houses. A deputy director of the Municipal Cultural Bureau forged accounts and embezzled over 7,000 yuan to fund his private house construction and has been arrested and prosecuted.

* Leaders of districts, towns, and offices. Leiyang City has 60 township-level administrative units, and two-thirds of the district and township party and government leaders have built private houses. The Party Secretary of Gaolu Town, located 30-40 kilometers from the city, mobilized over 70 workers from eight township enterprises and ten villages to help build his house in the city.

* Leaders of the Municipal Political and Legal Affairs Commission and its affiliated units are almost all involved in building private houses. In a town police station, all four leaders not only built private houses but also opened private hotels.

* In departments such as the Municipal Finance Commission, Grain Bureau, Agricultural Bank, and Tax Bureau, one-third of the staff have built private houses.

During the process of leaders occupying land to build private houses, a significant number of them have used their power for personal gain. One cadre, without approval from relevant departments, illegally acquired a plot of land from the nearby village of Niezhou and built a villa of several hundred square meters. The village of Meiqiao, near the city, donated a plot of land to five leaders and their relatives from the Municipal Party Committee, People's Congress, and Government to build private houses. In the "source of funds" column of the self-inspection form for building private houses by Leiyang City's party and government cadres, many people's construction funds were "borrowed" from individual business owners.

The rampant occupation of arable land and illegal construction of private houses in Leiyang City is related to the ineffective enforcement by relevant departments. Initially, only 27 cadres at the bureau and department level were handled, and most of them did not receive any organizational penalties, only paying some fines. By July of this year, 18 of these people still had not paid their fines in full.

More seriously, after the implementation of the national Land Management Law in 1987, the suburban areas of the city saw severe issues of leaders arbitrarily approving, villagers illegally building, and residents illegally buying arable land. Some villages were conducting investigations into the illegal occupation of arable land while simultaneously signing illegal land sale agreements. Some people only needed to pay a few dozen yuan in fines to legalize their illegally occupied land. This symbolic economic penalty encouraged the spread of illegal land occupation. Some villages even saw the phenomenon of people queuing up to pay fines through backdoors. That winter, hundreds of acres of arable land and tea mountains in the suburbs of Leiyang City were destroyed.

The Leiyang City Government had clearly stipulated that the land use for party and government cadres to build houses should be reported and approved step by step according to the management authority of the cadres; the average land use for urban residents building houses should be controlled within 60 square meters, and households with more people should not exceed 80 square meters. However, some leaders in Leiyang City continued to do as they pleased, leading to more people illegally occupying arable land.

One cadre, in the name of his wife and two daughters-in-law, bought three plots of residential land at a low price in the original seed farm, totaling 240 square meters, and built a mansion covering 330 square meters with a total construction area of 712 square meters. This private residence was built in a rush after the Henan Municipal Party Committee and Government issued an order to stop building private houses pending investigation. Another cadre, in the name of his wife and children, obtained several plots of residential land and built three buildings with a total construction area of 836 square meters.

In Leiyang City, such cases of building private houses and harming public interests are not uncommon. Certain deputy directors, using their authority, bought a pond at a low price to build a private house, blocking the waterway and turning 17 acres of paddy fields into dry land.

The illegal occupation of arable land to build private houses has left many farmers without land to till. A farmer in Niezhou Village originally had 2.5 acres of contracted land, which has all been taken over in recent years to build private houses. Although the four children in the family have been reclassified as non-agricultural population, none of them have been arranged for employment. Last year, the village gave 600 yuan in land compensation to buy grain, and this year it increased to 900 yuan, but life is still very difficult.

    耒阳市“私房热”透视
    领导干部建私房  群众利益遭侵害
    1984年以来，我省耒阳干部在耒阳市城区和近郊，掀起了一股建私房热。
    全市有868个党政干部建私房。这些干部主要是：
    市政府各委局的负责人。耒阳市政府现有37个委局，其中33个委局的负责人都参与了营建私房。市建委的4名正副主任，都建起了高标准的私宅。市建委机关干部建私房的占总人数的85％。市文化局一副局长为了筹款建私房，伪造假账，贪污7000多元，现已被逮捕法办。
    各区、乡镇、办事处的负责人。耒阳市有60个乡镇级基层行政单位，其中2／3的区乡镇党政一把手一人或两人建了私房。高炉乡离城三四十公里，党委书记在城内建房时，全乡有8个乡办企业的职工、10个村的村民70多人赶来帮工。
    市政法委及所属单位的主要负责人几乎都参与了营建私房。有个镇派出所4位领导人不仅都建了私房，而且有的还办起了私人旅馆。
    市财委、粮食局、农业银行、税务局等单位的机关干部建私房的，都达到这些单位总人数的1／3。
    在领导干部占地建私房过程中，相当一部分人以权谋私。一干部为了修建私房，未经有关部门批准，便从城区附近的聂州村假买真要了一块地皮，建起了一座数百平方米的别墅。城区附近的梅桥村为了向市里某些领导人进行“感情投资”，将一块地皮让给市委、市人大、市政府5名负责人及其亲属建私房。在耒阳市党政干部自清自查建私房表的“资金来源”一栏中，许多人的建房资金都是从个体户中“借”来的。
    耒阳市滥占耕地、乱建私房之风之所以蔓延起来，与有关部门查处不力有关。开初，有关部门只处理27名科局级干部，其中大多数未受任何组织处分，仅仅交了一些罚款便了事了，许多人还减免了罚款。时至今年7月，这些人中仍有18人未能交齐罚款。
    更为严重的是，在国家土地管理法颁布执行之后的1987年，市近郊区严重存在着领导乱批，村民乱建，居民乱买耕地的问题。有的乡村一方面在清查滥占耕地的问题，一方面在签订非法买卖土地的协议。一些人只需交纳几十元罚款，便可以将非法占地变为合法了。这种象征性的经济罚款，助长了违法占地现象盛行。一些乡村甚至出现了开后门排队交罚款的怪事。这年冬季，耒阳市近郊的百亩耕地、茶山毁于一旦。
    耒阳市政府曾明文规定，党政干部建房用地，按干部管理权限逐级上报审批；城市居民建房户平均用地控制在60平方米，人口较多的户也不超过80平方米。但是，耒阳市一些领导干部依然我行我素，致使更多的人乱占耕地。
    一干部以妻子和两个儿媳的名义，在原种场内低价买了3份宅基地，共计240平方米，建起了一座占地330多平方米，总建筑面积712平方米的高楼大院。这座私宅是在衡阳市委、市政府下达停建私房待清理的指示后，突击抢建的。一干部以妻子、儿女的名义弄到几处宅基地，建了3栋楼房，总建筑面积达836平方米。
    在耒阳城，类似这种建私房损害群众利益的并不少见。某副局长等利用职权，低价买了一处水塘建私房，致使水路阻断，17亩水田只能改作旱地。
    滥占耕地建私房，造成不少农民无田可耕。聂州村一农民原有2.5亩责任田，近年来先后全被占去建了私房。家里的4个孩子虽转为非农业人口，却无一人安排就业。去年村里给了600元土地赔偿费买粮，今年增至900元，生活仍很艰苦。
