The CPSU Central Committee held an extraordinary plenary session on the 25th and 26th to discuss the issue of the Lithuanian Communist Party declaring independence. In his report to the plenary session, CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev pointed out that the resolution of the 20th Congress of the Lithuanian Communist Party is illegal because it aims to separate organizationally and politically from the CPSU and ultimately establish an independent Lithuanian state.

The plenary session passed a resolution fully endorsing the conclusions and evaluations made by Gorbachev in his report. It was also decided that a central working group should be sent to Lithuania to meet with local party members, party organizations, and representatives of labor collectives. After that, the Central Committee will hold another meeting to make the appropriate decisions.

The 20th Congress of the Lithuanian Communist Party was held in Vilnius from the 19th to the 22nd of this month. The congress declared that the Lithuanian Communist Party is an independent political organization with its own party constitution and bylaws, maintaining equal relations with the CPSU. However, there were also representatives who opposed seceding from the CPSU.

    苏共中央非常全会认为
    立陶宛共产党宣布独立非法
    新华社莫斯科12月26日电  苏共中央于25日和26日召开非常全会，讨论立陶宛共产党宣布独立的问题。苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫在全会作报告时指出，立陶宛共产党20大的决议是非法的，因为它旨在从组织上和政治上脱离苏共，最终建立独立的立陶宛国。
    全会通过一项决议，表示完全赞同戈尔巴乔夫在报告中所作出的一些结论和评价，并认为有必要组成一个中央工作小组前往立陶宛，同当地的党员、党组织和劳动集体的代表举行会见；然后，中央将再次举行会议，做出相应的决定。
    立陶宛共产党第20次代表大会本月19日至22日在维尔纽斯举行。大会宣布立陶宛共产党是一个独立的、有着自己的党纲党章的政治组织，与苏共将保持平等的关系，但也有部分代表反对脱离苏共。
