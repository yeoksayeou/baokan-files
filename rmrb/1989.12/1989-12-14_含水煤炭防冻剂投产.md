The production line for water-containing coal anti-freeze agent, which is included in the national-level new product development plan, was completed and put into production on December 8 at the Taiyuan Fertilizer Factory. This chemical liquid agent, which prevents coal from freezing during transportation, was developed by the Beijing Railway Bureau Research Institute and produced by the Taiyuan Fertilizer Factory. Its successful trial production fills a gap in China and ends the history of relying on imported coal anti-freeze agents.

This product has been tested by units such as the Pingluo Open-Pit Coal Mine, operated jointly by China and the United States, and the Shanghai Baosteel, with remarkable effects. The lowest freezing point reaches minus 57 degrees Celsius, which is 25 degrees Celsius lower than the same type of American product, while the price is only half of the American product, and the quality reaches the world's advanced level. It has been promoted for use in coal transportation on the Daqin Railway and Qinhuangdao Port.

    含水煤炭防冻剂投产
    本报讯　列入国家级新产品开发计划的含水煤炭防冻剂生产线，12月8日在太原化肥厂建成投产。这种防止煤炭在运输中冻结的化学液剂，是由北京铁路局科研所研制，太原化肥厂组织生产的。它的试制成功，填补了我国一项空白，结束了靠进口煤炭防冻剂的历史。
    这项产品经中、美合作经营的平朔露天煤矿和上海宝钢等单位试用，效果显著，最低冰点达零下57摄氏度，比美国同类产品低25摄氏度，而价格只有美国一半，质量达到世界先进水平。已在大秦铁路和秦皇岛港煤炭运输中推广使用。
