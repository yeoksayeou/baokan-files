Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 16th - Reporter Zheng Shengfeng reports: This year, Guangxi implemented a large-scale grain development project under the "Spark" initiative. 14 million mu of farmland increased grain production by 1 billion jin, benefiting 3 million rural households across the region.

This project, organized and implemented by the Autonomous Region Science and Technology Commission, is officially known as the "10 Million Mu Grain Large-Scale Increase Production Comprehensive Technology Promotion and Application" Spark project. Its goal is to organize 10,000 agricultural scientists to guide or contract 10 million mu of farmland across the region, implementing scientific management from sowing and seedling cultivation to pest control and disease prevention, aiming to increase grain production by 500 million jin.

Guangxi's grain production has been stagnant for many years, making the situation severe. Therefore, the Spark project for scientific grain production has been widely welcomed and supported across the region, and has been implemented through layer-by-layer contract signing. As a result, the main targets of the Spark project have been significantly exceeded: the total area of farmland requested to be included in the project by various places exceeds the plan by 40%, the number of participating agricultural scientists and the total amount of increased production both exceed the plan by 100%, and the average increase per mu also exceeds the highest target of 50 jin.

The Spark project has brought not only increased grain production but also positive influences and social benefits, such as:

	- Enhancing the scientific awareness of leaders at all levels. 81 cities and counties participating in the project implementation have established project management command centers, and township and village levels have also established project leadership groups. Leaders at all levels have personally planted and managed project command fields totaling 1.86 million mu in their respective contact points.
	- Combining project implementation with the reconstruction of the grassroots agricultural science network to improve farmers' scientific and technological literacy. This year, the region has assigned more than 13,000 village-level farmer technicians, who have passed on the scientific and technological spark to thousands of households. These "second-generation scientific and technological disseminators," in cooperation with full-time agricultural science and technology personnel, have held more than 20,000 training sessions of various kinds according to the technical requirements of the agricultural season over the past year, training 1 million grain Spark demonstration households.

    万名农科人员下乡　开发千万亩农田
    广西科技兴农粮食增产
    1400万亩粮田今年多收粮食10亿公斤
    本报南宁12月16日电　记者郑盛丰报道：广西今年实施规模宏大的粮食开发星火项目，1400万亩农田增产粮食10亿公斤，给全区300万农户带来实惠。
    这个由自治区科委牵头组织实施、全称为“千万亩粮食大面积增产综合技术推广应用”星火项目，其目标是：组织万名农科人员，在全区范围内指导或承包1000万亩农田，从播种育秧到防虫治病全程实行科学管理，以期增产粮食5亿公斤。
    广西粮食生产因多年徘徊不前而形势严峻。因而，科技兴粮的星火项目在全区赢得了广泛的欢迎与支持，以层层签订合同的方式得以落实。结果，星火项目的主要目标都明显突破：各地要求纳入项目的农田总面积超过计划40％，参与的农科人员和实现增产总量均超过计划1倍，平均每亩增产也突破最高目标50公斤。
    这个星火项目带来的不仅是粮食丰产，它的积极影响和社会效益还表现在：
    ——增强了各级领导的科技意识。81个参与实施项目的地市县都成立了项目管理指挥部，乡、村两级也成立了项目领导小组。各级主要党政领导在各自联系点上，亲自种植和管理项目指挥田达186万亩。
    ——结合实施项目推动重建基层农科网，提高农民的科技素质。全区今年共配备了13000多名村级农民技术员，通过他们把科技星火传到千家万户，这些“科技二传手”配合专职农科干部，根据农事季节的技术要求，一年来举办了2万多期各种内容的培训班，培训了100万粮食星火示范户。
