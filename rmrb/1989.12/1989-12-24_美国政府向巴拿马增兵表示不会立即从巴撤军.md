Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 22nd.

The U.S. President Bush said today that American troops invading Panama will not withdraw immediately.

Bush said in a letter to Congress that although organized resistance in Panama has largely subsided, it is currently not possible to accurately predict the scale, duration, and the extent of reinforcement needed for this military operation.

It was also reported that Bush has ordered the deployment of an additional 2,000 troops to Panama, bringing the total number of U.S. troops there to 26,000.

The Director of Operations for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Tom Kelly, said that the purpose of this reinforcement is mainly to accelerate the elimination of Noriega's resistance forces.

    美国政府向巴拿马增兵表示不会立即从巴撤军
    据新华社华盛顿12月22日电　美国总统布什今天说，入侵巴拿马的美国军队不会马上撤走。
    布什在给国会的一封信中说，虽然巴拿马有组织的抵抗活动已基本平息，但眼下还不可能准确地预计美国这次军事行动的规模、所持续的时间，以及所需的增援行动将要持续多久。
    另据报道，布什今天已下令向巴拿马增派2000名军人，从而使在那里的美军人数达到26000人。
    美国参谋长联席会议作战部主任汤姆·凯利将军说，这次增援的目的主要是为了加速清除诺列加的抵抗力量。
