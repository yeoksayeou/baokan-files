Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu summoned the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Bell, today to engage in negotiations with the U.S. side regarding the U.S. government's statement and memorandum on the issue of Chinese students abroad.

Liu Huaqiu stated that although the "1989 Emergency Amendment to the Chinese Immigration Law" was shelved and rejected by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. government has issued a statement and memorandum on this matter. Using the pretext that Chinese students returning to China might face persecution, the U.S. announced administrative measures identical to the content of the aforementioned congressional bill, exempting all Chinese students holding J-1 visas from the two-year home-country service requirement.

He said, "Regarding the U.S. side's actions to undermine the Sino-U.S. educational exchange agreement and harm Sino-U.S. relations, I am instructed to express strong indignation and protest to the U.S. government."

Liu Huaqiu pointed out, "The claim that Chinese students returning to China might face 'persecution' is completely groundless. We hope that the U.S. government, considering the overall interests of the two countries and the long-term benefits of the peoples of both countries, will immediately stop all actions that undermine educational exchanges between the two countries and harm bilateral relations."

    外交部同美方进行交涉
    刘华秋昨约见美临时代办表示强烈抗议
    希望美方立即停止损害两国关系的行动
    新华社北京12月8日电　外交部副部长刘华秋今天约见美国驻华使馆临时代办贝霖，就美国政府发表有关中国留学人员问题的声明和备忘录向美方进行了交涉。
    刘华秋说，美国国会“1989年紧急放宽中国移民法案”虽被搁置否决，但美国政府又就此事发表了声明和备忘录，以中国留学人员回国可能受到迫害为由，宣布了同国会上述法案内容一样的豁免全部持J—1签证的中国留学人员回国服务两年的限制等行政措施。
    他说，“对于美方这一破坏中美教育交流协议、损害中美关系的举动，我奉命向美国政府表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。”
    刘华秋指出，“所谓中国留学人员回国可能受到‘迫害’的说法是毫无根据的。我们希望美国政府从两国关系的大局和两国人民的长远利益出发，立即停止一切破坏两国教育交流和损害两国关系的行动。”
