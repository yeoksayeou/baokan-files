Title: Reading "Leaders, Marshals, Comrades"
Author: Dan Linyi

Edition: 6

Leaders and senior officials of the first generation of the Party, the state, and the military who made significant contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of socialism have passed away one after another. Many articles have been written to commemorate and recall their merits. Recently, "Leaders, Marshals, Comrades," published by the Central Party School Press, is a very attractive book among such works.

The author of the book is the highly respected elderly revolutionary, Comrade Bo Yibo. Like many Party members, cadres, and the masses, he suffered the disaster of the ten-year "Cultural Revolution" and was cruelly persecuted and harmed by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four." He spent eight years in prison. In 1979, after being reinstated to his leadership position, he wrote an article recalling Comrade Mao Zedong with deep feelings and a unique style. This article, in contrast to the previously prevalent "cult of personality," used historical materialism to provide a comprehensive and objective recollection and evaluation of Comrade Mao Zedong, which attracted the attention and welcome of readers at home and abroad. Some readers wrote to Old Bo, hoping he could continue writing. From these encouragements, he deeply felt the responsibility to write down what he knew about these important historical figures' activities, revolutionary deeds, and personal qualities to educate the present and future generations. Thus, he spent a lot of effort, writing from the heart, word by word, and carefully produced this book. The book includes articles recalling Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Ren Bishi, and others; articles recalling Marshals Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Chen Yi, and Ye Jianying; and articles recalling comrades who lived and worked with Old Bo during the revolutionary war years and the socialist construction period, such as Li Fuchun, Teng Daiyuan, Chen Yuandao, Zhang Zhaofeng, Gu Xiongyi, and Xie Zichang. Therefore, the author titled it "Leaders, Marshals, Comrades."

Old Bo is one of the participants and leaders of China's revolution and construction. Since joining the Party and participating in the revolution in 1925, he has had over sixty years of revolutionary experience. Whether in the struggle in the white areas, on the front lines of the Anti-Japanese War, during the Rectification Movement in Yan'an, in the War of Liberation, or during the peaceful construction of socialism, he has had contact and interactions with the aforementioned comrades. It is rare to have such a highly respected figure in the Party with rich experience personally writing memoirs about the first-generation high-level leadership group of our Party, state, and military.

The figures written about in the book are all revolutionary pioneers who made a significant impact on the stage of modern Chinese revolutionary history. These recollection articles, compiled into a book, present a historical scroll of the Chinese revolution to the readers. What is even more precious is that the author not only provides many little-known historical facts and some interesting anecdotes not found in the "classics" in many places in the book but also, based on systematically providing background materials and clarifying facts, objectively evaluates many major historical events involving these figures, such as Comrade Liu Shaoqi's visit and speech in Tianjin and the directive on mutual aid and cooperation to the Shanxi Provincial Committee; Comrade Zhou Enlai's proposal to counter "impulsiveness" in economic construction in the 1950s; Comrade Peng Dehuai's situation during the Hundred Regiments Offensive and the Lushan Conference; and Comrade Ye Jianying's issue with Guangdong regionalism, etc. This is obviously helpful for everyone to understand the true facts and correctly recognize these historical events.

When writing these articles, Old Bo adhered to the principle of seeking truth from facts. After reading these articles, you will feel that the living historical figures are vividly depicted in the author's pen, without exaggeration, embellishment, or flattery, but letting the facts speak for themselves, and with objective analysis and evaluation. For example, Mao Zedong, in the author's pen, is both a kind, knowledgeable, far-sighted figure who indeed has the qualifications and talent of a leader, and at the same time, without concealing the mistakes made in certain years and on some issues, the author analyzes the reasons for these mistakes. It is neither praising achievements nor arbitrarily labeling, but reasonable and penetrating. For Liu Shaoqi, the author not only describes his achievements in correctly implementing the Party's line and policies in the white areas with enthusiastic and full-bodied language but also, with infinite sympathy, reviews and clarifies the true facts of the false "charges" that defamed and persecuted him to death during the "Cultural Revolution," but at the same time, also evaluates his various shortcomings and errors in a manner that is consistent with facts and reason.

In recalling the historical activities of the aforementioned historical figures, it is inevitable to involve some experiences related to the author himself. The author intends to restore history to its original state. When discussing his own mistakes in history, he does not conceal them. For example, the author talks about his work in leading and developing the "Shanxi Youth Anti-Japanese Volunteer Corps" and the "Shanxi Sacrifice and Save the Nation Alliance" in Shanxi with a legal identity, mentioning that he generally followed Comrade Mao Zedong's strategy of "being flexible on the inside and round on the outside," but sometimes he liked to "show off" and move big principles, lacking flexibility. The author talks about his work in the Taihang Column, mentioning that in handling the relationships among various parts of the army, he had a bias towards the troops he had once led. When talking about our Party's mistake of the "Great Leap Forward" in 1958, the author believes that it is not appropriate to push all the responsibility onto Comrade Mao Zedong alone; at that time, some responsible comrades in the central departments and local areas also had some responsibility, and mentions that the inappropriate slogan of "steel as the key" was summarized by himself. Writing historical works and memoirs should be like this, seeking truth from facts and being loyal to historical facts.

Old Bo does not simply pursue the past and commemorate the deceased in these articles but often infuses them with profound historical reflections. He believes that the most important historical experience is that in both revolutionary war years and socialist construction periods, people's subjective world must be consistent with the objective world. When they are relatively consistent, our cause progresses smoothly and succeeds; when they are not consistent and separate, our cause suffers setbacks. For example, the reason why the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and the economic construction in the early years after the founding of the country, as well as the reform and opening-up work in the few years after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, led by our Party, achieved great success and created miracles is that our lines, policies, and guidelines were relatively consistent with the objective reality. Once we become arrogant, complacent, and eager for quick success, we will inevitably produce deviations and mistakes. History is a mirror; if we often look into the mirror, we can gain wisdom and avoid detours. Reading Old Bo's book may have this effect.

I believe that the publication of this book will be beneficial for the broad masses of Party members, cadres, the masses, and youth to understand the history of our Party, the heroic deeds, noble qualities, and communist spirit of revolutionary predecessors, the fine traditions of the Party, and the experience and lessons of history, and to promote reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations. It is also worth reading for Party historians and Party affairs workers.

    读《领袖、元帅、战友》
    单霖一
    为中国人民的解放事业和社会主义建设事业建立功勋的第一代党、国家和军队的领导人相继故世，人们撰写过不少文章缅怀、追忆他们的功德。最近，由中共中央党校出版社出版的《领袖、元帅、战友》，在这类著作中是一本很有吸引力的读物。
    书的作者是德高望重的老一辈无产阶级革命家薄一波同志。他和许许多多党员、干部、群众一样，同罹了十年“文革”的灾难，遭到林彪、“四人帮”的残酷迫害和摧残，在狱中渡过了八年。1979年，他被重新恢复领导工作以后，就以深厚的感情、独特的风格，撰写了一篇回忆毛泽东同志的文章。这篇文章一反过去盛行的“个人迷信”，用历史唯物主义观点，对毛泽东同志进行了全面的、客观的回忆、评价，受到了国内外读者的关注和欢迎。有的读者投书薄老（很久以来，人们就这样尊称他），希望他能继续写下去。他从这些鼓励中，深感有责任把自己所了解的这些重要历史人物的活动、革命事迹和思想品质写下来，教育今人和子子孙孙。于是，他花费了许多心血，一字一句发自内心，陆陆续续地认真写作出来，就形成了这本书。书中有回忆毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、任弼时等同志的文章，有回忆彭德怀、刘伯承、贺龙、陈毅、叶剑英等元帅的文章，也有回忆革命战争年代和社会主义建设时期和薄老共同生活、工作在一起的李富春、滕代远、陈原道、张兆丰、谷雄一、谢子长等战友的文章。因而，作者把它题名为《领袖、元帅、战友》。
    薄老是我国革命和建设的参加者和领导者之一。从1925年入党、参加革命，他已有六十多年的革命经历。无论在白区斗争，在抗战前线，在延安整风，在解放战争中，还是在社会主义和平建设时期，他都和上述这些同志有过接触和交往。由这样一位在党内享有很高威望，有着丰富阅历的老同志，亲笔写下我们党、国家和军队第一代高层次领导人物群体的回忆录，还是不多见的。
    书中所写的这些人物，都是在中国现代革命历史舞台上叱咤风云的革命前驱。这些回忆文章汇辑成册，就向读者展示了中国革命的历史画卷。更加难能可贵的是，作者不但在书中不少地方发人所未发，道人所未道，提供了许多鲜为人知的史实和一些不见于“经传”的趣闻逸事，而且，对涉及这些人物的许多重大历史事件，比如，刘少奇同志的天津之行和讲话，对山西省委关于互助合作的批示；周恩来同志在五十年代经济建设中提出反“冒进”的问题；彭德怀同志在百团大战、庐山会议的情况，以及叶剑英同志与广东地方主义问题，等等，在系统提供背景材料和澄清事实的基础上，进行了客观的评价，这对大家了解事实真相和正确认识这些历史事件，显然是有帮助的。
    薄老在撰写这些文章时，遵循的是实事求是的原则。读过这些文章，你会感到，在作者的笔下，这些活生生的历史人物跃然纸上，没有夸张、修饰和颂谀之词，而是由事实说话，“秉笔直书”和全面的分析评价。比如毛泽东，在作者笔下，既是一个和蔼可亲、知识渊博、远见卓识，确实具有领袖资格和才华的人物，同时，不为尊者“讳”，指出了在某些岁月，在一些问题上，他确有失误，并分析了失误的原因。既不是歌功颂德，也不是乱扣帽子，而是入情入理，入木三分。对刘少奇，作者不但以热情饱满的笔调记述了他正确执行党在白区工作的路线和政策的功绩，而且更以无限的同情，对“文革”中诬陷、迫害他致死的一些不实“罪状”，进行了事实真相的回顾与澄清，但同时，对他的这样那样的缺点错误也进行了符合事实和情理的评说。
    在追忆上述这些历史人物的历史活动中，很自然免不了涉及到与作者本人有关的一些经历，作者意在还历史以本来面目。涉及到他自己在历史上的一些过错，他毫不掩饰。比如作者在山西以合法身份，领导和发展、壮大“山西青年抗敌决死队”和“山西牺牲救国同盟会”的工作时，谈到自己总的来说是按照毛泽东同志“内方外圆”的策略思想办事的，但时不时，“好插野鸡翎”，好搬大原则，缺乏灵活性。作者谈到自己在太岳纵队工作时，在处理部队各部分关系中，有袒护曾经由自己领导过的部队的偏向。讲到我们党在1958年犯“大跃进”的错误时，作者认为，不能把全部责任推到毛泽东同志一个人头上，当时一些在中央部门和地方工作的负责人也有一定责任，并讲到，“以钢为纲”这个不恰当的口号就是由自己概括出来的。撰写历史著作和回忆录，就应该这样，实事求是，忠于历史事实。
    薄老在这些文章中，不是简单地追寻往事，缅怀昔人，而是常常浸润着深沉的历史思索。他认为，最重要的一条历史经验，就是无论在革命战争年代还是在社会主义建设时期，人们的主观世界必须与客观世界相一致。什么时候比较一致，我们的事业进展就顺利，就意味着成功，什么时候不一致了，二者分离了，我们的事业就遭到挫折。比如，我们党领导的抗日战争、解放战争和建国初期的经济建设、党的十一届三中全会以后头几年的改革、开放工作，之所以取得巨大成功，出现奇迹，就是因为我们的路线、方针、政策与客观是比较相符合的。一旦忘乎所以，骄傲情绪滋长起来，好大喜功，急于求成，就必然产生偏差和失误。历史是一面镜子，时常照一照镜子，就可以增长智慧，少走弯路。读一读薄老的这本书，也许可以起到这方面的作用。
    我相信，这本书的出版，对于帮助广大党员、干部、群众、青年了解我们党的历史，了解革命先辈的英雄事迹、高尚品德和共产主义献身精神，了解和发扬党的优良传统，吸取历史的经验和教训，促进改革开放和四化建设，都会是有所裨益的，对于党史研究者和党务工作者也是值得一读的。
