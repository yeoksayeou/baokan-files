The Xingtai Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau have implemented regular, institutionalized, and standardized management of family planning, shifting from a passive to a proactive approach. By mid-November, the family planning rate in the region reached 96%, and the population birth rate decreased by over 3,600 compared to the same period last year.

According to reports, Xingtai previously relied on periodic large-scale campaigns to promote family planning, but these efforts often lacked follow-up.

This year, the Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau proposed a new approach to family planning. The specific measures include: establishing a dedicated team from the county to the village level to oversee family planning work; conducting a comprehensive survey of all women of childbearing age; creating archives for women of childbearing age; and setting up family planning service stations in townships, equipped with inspection and surgical instruments. Now, women of childbearing age can have IUD insertions and removals, pregnancy checks, and abortions without leaving the village. The entire region has standardized the period from the 25th to the end of each month as family planning activity days. During this time, all women of childbearing age are divided into batches to visit the family planning service stations for inspections, and any issues are promptly addressed.

Currently, the region's family planning work has shifted from past sporadic campaigns to monthly inspections and daily efforts, ensuring transparency and creating a good atmosphere for promoting family planning. People's awareness of national policies has strengthened. By doing a lot of work in advance, the workload has gradually decreased, and various levels of party and government leaders have gradually been freed from these responsibilities.

    管理经常化、制度化、规范化
    邢台形成计划生育良好气候
    本报讯　记者吴坤胜报道：河北邢台地委、行署对计划生育实行经常化、制度化、规范化管理，由被动变为主动。到11月中旬，全区计划生育率达96％，人口出生比去年同期减少3600多人。
    据介绍，邢台地区以往抓计划生育工作，一直沿用每年搞几次大突击的办法，突击过后却无人过问。
    今年初，地委、行署提出计划生育工作的设想，具体做法是：建立一支从县到乡村的抓计划生育工作的专门队伍；对所有育龄妇女逐户逐人进行普查；建立育龄妇女档案；乡镇组建计划生育服务站，配备检查和手术器械。现在，育龄妇女上环取环、孕检不出村，人工流产不出乡。全区统一规定，每月25日至月底为计划生育活动日。活动期间所有育龄妇女分批到计划生育服务站检查，发现问题及时解决。
    目前，该地区计划生育工作已由过去的被动突击转向月月查，天天做，情况明，形成了抓计划生育的良好气候，人们的国策观念增强了。大量工作做在平时，工作量越来越小，各级党政领导逐步解脱出来。
