Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th.

The 11th session of the Standing Committee of the 7th National People's Congress continued its group discussions today, reviewing the report by State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying to the Standing Committee on "Several Issues in China's Education Work."

Committee members generally agreed that Comrade Li Tieying's report fully affirmed the tremendous achievements in China's education sector over the past decade, objectively reported the mistakes and existing problems in education work, and proposed solutions based on a summary of experiences. The report provided a relatively comprehensive and realistic analysis of China's education situation.

Commissioner Yi Meihou said that the achievements in China's education work over the past decade are remarkable and should be fully affirmed. However, the development of higher education must be adapted to the national conditions and should be determined based on the country's demand for high-tech and cultural talents.

Commissioner Huang Zhijian pointed out that in recent years, while implementing the policy of all-round development of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, aesthetics, and labor, there has been a tendency to emphasize intelligence education over moral education and to detach from reality. Especially for the principle of combining education with productive labor, which Marx repeatedly emphasized, this has not been implemented in recent years. Many schools have opinions on these issues. Due to a period of weakened ideological and political work, students do not receive the necessary education, lack a firm and clear political direction, do not study hard, and their academic performance has shown a declining trend. He advocated that the cultivation of students' communist worldview and outlook on life should be placed at the forefront of school education, and Marxist-Mao Zedong Thought education should be persistently carried out. Students should also participate in practical work and labor training as much as possible, strengthen their connection with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strengthen ideological and political work.

Vice Chairman Chen Muxia said that there are still phenomena of gender inequality and discrimination against women in education. The admission score line for girls is higher than that for boys by one or two hundred points. Additionally, some units prefer "a short man over a tall woman," and even female university students and graduates cannot find jobs. She believed that improving national cultural quality requires equal attention to both men and women, and the phenomenon of discrimination against women must be explicitly prohibited.

Commissioner Wang Jinling said that the report emphasizes combining education with production to improve students' political and professional qualities, which is very enlightening. This way, students can stand on the national conditions and find a development path that suits themselves and is in the national interest.

    人大常委会继续分组讨论
    审议李铁映《关于我国教育工作若干问题的汇报》
    新华社北京12月25日电  七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议今天继续进行分组讨论，审议国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映向人大常委会所作的《关于我国教育工作若干问题的汇报》。
    委员们普遍认为，李铁映同志的报告既充分肯定了近十年来我国教育事业的巨大成就，又客观地汇报了教育工作的失误和存在的问题，同时在总结经验的基础上提出了解决问题的意见，比较全面地、实事求是地分析了我国的教育形势。
    蚁美厚委员说，十年间我国教育工作的成就是了不起的，应该充分肯定。但发展高等教育，一定要与国情相适应，应该根据国家对于高等科技、文化人才的需求确定发展速度。
    黄志坚委员提出，近年来，在执行德智体美劳全面发展的教育方针中，存在重智育轻德育和脱离实际的倾向。特别是对于教育与生产劳动相结合这个马克思反复强调的原理，这几年基本没有实行。对于上述这些问题许多学校是有意见的。由于一个时期，思想政治工作削弱，学生得不到应有的教育，缺乏坚定明确的政治方向，学习不够刻苦努力，学业成绩也随之有下降的趋势。他主张，必须把培养学生的共产主义世界观、人生观放到学校教育的首位，坚持不懈地进行马克思主义毛泽东思想教育，并且尽可能参加实际工作和劳动锻炼，加强与工农兵群众的结合。同时，必须真正把思想政治工作加强起来。
    陈慕华副委员长说，目前在教育方面仍存在男女不平等、歧视妇女的现象，女孩子录取分数线比男孩子要高出一、二百分。另外，有些用人单位“宁要武大郎，不要穆桂英”，女大学生甚至研究生分不出去的现象也出现了。她认为，提高民族文化素质，男女都要同样受到重视，歧视妇女的现象必须明令禁止。
    王金陵委员说，报告强调教育同生产相结合来提高学生的政治思想与业务素质，很有启发性，这样才能使学生立足于国情，找到适合自己、符合国家利益的发展之路。
