People's Daily, London, December 9th. Reporter Chen Te'an reports: Recently, the spread of influenza in the United Kingdom has caused alarm among doctors and attracted the attention of the government.

The latest data shows that by December 5th, in England and Wales, 109 out of every 100,000 people were infected with influenza, and 154 out of every 100,000 people exhibited flu-like symptoms. This number is three times that of the previous week. Currently, the infection rate of this flu has reached its highest point since 1975 (but is lower than the highest record 20 years ago, which was 918.1 people per 100,000 infected with influenza), exceeding the official threshold.

Many schools, hospitals, and enterprises are "struggling with staff shortages due to the impact of the flu." "Many hospitals are now only accepting emergency patients and have stopped routine outpatient services."

    流感袭击英国
    本报伦敦12月9日电　记者陈特安报道：最近英国蔓延流行性感冒已引起医生惊恐和政府的重视。
    最新的数据表明，截至12月5日的一周里，在英格兰和威尔士，每10万人中有109人患流感，而且每10万人中有154个病例具有流感症状。这个数字是前一周的3倍。目前这种流感的感染率达到1975年以来的最高点（但低于20年前的最高纪录，即每10万人中有918.1人患流感），超过了官方规定的界限。
    许多学校、医院、企业都“由于流感的冲击而陷于职工短缺”，“许多医院现在只接受急诊病人而停止日常门诊”。
