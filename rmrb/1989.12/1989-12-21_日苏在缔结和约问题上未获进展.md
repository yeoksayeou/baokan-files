Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 19th.

The fourth round of negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union on concluding a peace treaty concluded today in Tokyo after two days of discussions, with no progress made.

Both sides reiterated their long-standing positions during the negotiations. The Japanese side insisted on the return of the Northern Territories as a precondition for signing a peace treaty. The Soviet side, however, emphasized that Japan's territorial demands are unfounded.

A Japanese Foreign Ministry official stated that this was a debate with no new elements. Japan has no room to compromise, and the Soviet side will not show flexibility on the territorial issue.

    日苏在缔结和约问题上未获进展
    新华社东京12月19日电　据时事社报道，历时两天的日苏第4次关于缔结和平条约协商会议今天在此间结束，未取得任何进展。
    双方在协商会议中重申了各自迄今多次表明的立场。日方坚持在归还北方领土的前提下缔结和平条约。苏方则强调日方在领土方面的要求是没有根据的。
    日本外务省人士说，这是没有任何新意的一场争论。日本没有让步的余地，苏方也不会在领土问题上表示出灵活的态度。
