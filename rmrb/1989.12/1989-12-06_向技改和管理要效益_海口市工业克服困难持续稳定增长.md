Reporter Luo Zisu reports from Haikou: Adhering to the principle of seeking solutions through technological upgrades and efficiency through management, Haikou City has overcome difficulties such as financial shortages and rising prices of raw materials and fuel this year. The city has achieved simultaneous growth in production value, profits, taxes, and sales, making progress in technological renovations and new product development.

Haikou City's industrial foundation is weak. Starting last year, it entered a new phase of development, with the annual industrial output value increasing by 58% compared to 1987. However, this year, the city has faced challenges such as financial shortages, significant increases in the prices of raw materials and fuel, and large gaps in supply. The municipal government has acknowledged these difficulties and mobilized the public to work together to overcome them:

- Various departments across the city have supported industrial production to address the shortage of fuel. At the beginning of the year, the municipal government, facing a severe shortage of coal (50% short of the required amount), coordinated efforts from various parties to adopt multiple measures such as multi-party operations, cross-industry operations, imports, and borrowing from provincial-level units. These efforts secured over 30,000 tons of coal outside the plan, temporarily alleviating the coal shortage.

- Efforts have been made to secure loans from various sources to address the shortage of working capital. Provincial and municipal banks have actively raised loans for industrial production in the city. By the end of last year, over 30 million yuan had been secured for working capital at the beginning of this year. By September, the loan balance had increased by over 40 million yuan compared to the same period last year. The municipal commercial bank has also taken on the task of pursuing overdue payments on behalf of enterprises, helping to resolve their difficulties.

- While strengthening enterprise management, the city has focused on technological renovations and new product development. By the end of September, the city had completed 20 technological renovation projects, investing 91.8 million yuan, increasing production value by 97.92 million yuan, and generating 16.76 million yuan in taxes and profits. Over the past two years, 189 new products have been developed, increasing production value by 262.4 million yuan and generating 39 million yuan in taxes and profits.

Through the collective efforts of all sectors in the city, industrial production has made significant progress despite the difficulties. In the first 10 months of this year, the city's cumulative industrial output value reached 776.61 million yuan, achieving 78% of the annual plan and a 15% increase compared to the same period last year. Economic benefits have also been good. In the first 9 months, the sales revenue of municipal industrial enterprises reached 373.33 million yuan, a 34.33% increase compared to the same period last year.

    向技改和管理要效益
    海口市工业克服困难持续稳定增长
    本报海口12月5日电  记者罗自苏报道：坚持从技改找出路、向管理要效益。海口市今年以来克服资金短缺、原材料、燃料涨价等困难，实现了产值、利润、税收、销售同步增长，技术改造和新产品开发取得进展。
    海口市工业底子薄，去年开始进入发展的新时期，全年工业总产值比1987年增长58％。但今年以来，遇到资金紧缺、原材料燃料涨价幅度大、缺口大等困难。市政府正视困难，动员群众同心同德共渡难关：
    ——全市各部门支援工业生产，解决燃料紧缺问题。年初，市政府根据全市工业用煤短缺50％的严峻局面，协调各方力量采取多家经营、跨行业经营和进口，以及向省级有关单位借调等一系列措施，解决计划外煤炭3万多吨，缓解了“燃煤”之急。
    ——多方筹措贷款、解决流动资金不足的困难。省和市各大银行积极为市工业生产筹集贷款。去年底就为今年初解决流动资金3000多万元，到9月止贷款余额比去年同期增加4000多万元。市工商行还开展替企业在省外追索欠款业务，为企业解决困难。
    ——在强化企业管理的同时，抓好技术改造和新产品开发。全市到9月底完成技改20项，投资9180万元，新增产值9792万元，创税利1676万元。两年来共开发新产品189个，新增长产值2624万元，创税利390万元。
    通过全市各方面的努力，使工业生产在困难情况下取得可喜进展。今年头10个月全市累计完成工业总产值77661万元，为年度计划的78％，比去年同期增长15％。经济效益也较好，今年头9个月市属工业销售收入已达37333万元，比去年同期增长34.33％。
