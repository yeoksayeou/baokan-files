The era when Inner Mongolian herdsmen used cow oil lamps is being replaced by new energy lighting. Recently, the reporter learned from relevant departments that nearly 70,000 wind-powered generators and more than 3,000 solar photovoltaic systems have brought light and warmth to 70,000 herdsmen households on the grasslands. Now, when herdsmen return from grazing, they no longer sit by the oil lamp drinking to pass the time. Instead, the whole family gathers around the television, drinking milk tea, and enjoying a variety of television programs, keeping up with domestic and international news.

Inner Mongolia has extremely rich wind and solar energy resources.

    内蒙古发展新能源照明
    七万户牧民的牛油灯被取代
    据新华社呼和浩特十二月六日电  （记者阿斯钢）昔日内蒙古草原牧民用牛油点灯的时代正在被新能源照明所取代。记者日前从有关部门获悉，近七万台风力发电机和三千多套太阳光电装置，给草原牧区的七万多户牧民带来了光明和温暖。如今牧民放牧归来，不再是对着油灯喝酒解闷，而是全家围坐在电视机旁，喝着奶茶，观赏丰富多采的电视节目，了解国内外大事。
    内蒙古有极为丰富的风能和太阳能资源。
