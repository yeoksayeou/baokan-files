I first saw Liu De at the 1987 National Wushu Sanshou (Free Sparring) Competition in Harbin in the 60-kilogram weight class final. He and his opponent fought fiercely, neither giving an inch. Both were aggressive, their fists and feet moving in unison, never missing a beat. After several rounds, Liu De executed a beautiful move, sending his opponent crashing to the ground. Amidst the cheers of the audience, Liu De fought even more vigorously, his strikes becoming more precise. With a swift turn and a horizontal punch, he struck his opponent's head, then followed up by sending him to the ground again. Liu De emerged victorious. His skill and tenacious spirit left a deep impression on me.

Two years later, I saw Liu De again. He was only 24 years old but had already become a coach for the Guangdong Provincial Wushu Team. Liu De believes that being a coach is even more challenging than being an athlete. One must be more mature and resilient. Liu De often sacrifices his weekends to give extra lessons to the younger team members. Once, on a weekend, most of the team members had gone home, but Liu De was still in the training room, guiding a few team members in defensive and counterattacking drills. A young team member said to Liu De, "Coach Liu, my family is waiting for me to watch a movie. Can we practice on Monday?" Liu De replied sternly, "When you meet the requirements, then we can stop. My friend and I have a date tonight." It was so simple, without any grand words, but it moved the young team member. I asked him, "Being a coach must be very tiring, right?" Liu De said, "I am still young, just starting out, and I don't feel tired. I want to dedicate everything to the martial arts that I love."

In recent years, Liu De has often served as a judge for national and international Wushu Sanshou competitions. His paper "On Accelerating the Development of Sanshou in Our Country" won the Excellent Award at the first National Wushu Academic Conference, and he has written articles such as "Sanshou Technique Lecture" in some magazines. He also hopes to contribute to the promotion of Wushu Sanshou to the world one day.

    勤奋耕耘在武林
    ——记年轻武术教练刘德
    我第一次见到刘德是在1987年哈尔滨全国武术散打比赛60公斤级冠亚军决赛上。他和对手打得难解难分。双方积极进攻，拳脚相加，手不空回，拳不虚发。十几个回合后，刘德以漂亮的一招把对方摔倒在地。在观众的欢呼声中，刘德越战越勇，越打越漂亮，一个转身横边拳击中对方头部，紧接着又把对方摔倒在地。刘德取得了胜利，他的技艺和顽强的作风，给我留下了极其深刻的印象。
    两年后我又见到刘德，他才24岁，却已担任广东省武术队教练。刘德认为，做一个教练比做运动员更不容易。要更加成熟、坚强。刘德经常放弃星期天给小队员补课。有一次周末，大部分队员都回家了，刘德还在练习房辅导几名队员进行防守反击练习。一个小队员对刘德说：“刘教练，我们家等我看电影呢，星期一再练吧。”刘德严肃地说：“什么时候符合要求，什么时候才能结束，我的朋友今晚和我还约会呢。”就这样简单，没有什么大道理，感动了小队员。我问他：“做一个教练很辛苦吧？”刘德说：“我还年轻，刚刚起步，不觉得辛苦。我要把我的一切献给自己所喜爱的武术运动。”
    近年来，刘德多次担任全国及国际武术散打擂台比赛的裁判。他的论文《论加快我国散打运动的发展步伐》获首届全国武术论文研讨会优秀奖，曾在一些杂志上撰写《散打技法讲座》。他还想有朝一日为向世界推广武术散打做点贡献呢。　孙鸿武
