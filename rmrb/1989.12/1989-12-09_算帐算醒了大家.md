Located at the southern foot of the Qinling Mountains, the Shaanxi Province's Shangluo Region administers six counties and one city, with a total population of 2,232,700. The area is characterized by its mountainous terrain, deep valleys, infertile land, and remote isolation, making it one of the poorest regions in both Shaanxi Province and the entire country. Data indicates that in 1988, the region's per capita grain availability and farmers' per capita net income were nearly 300 kilograms and 300 yuan lower than the national average, respectively, a disparity economists refer to as the "double 300 gap."

In April of this year, during a national forum on the "Eleventh Billion People Day," Regional Party Secretary Feng Xuxi and Regional Governor Yang Yongnian joined others in calculating two sets of figures, illustrating how a large population and limited arable land have exacerbated the region's overall issues of food and financial scarcity.

The first set of figures concerns population and arable land. From the early days of liberation to the present, the region's total population has increased by nearly one million, while arable land has decreased by over one million mu. The rapid population growth and sharp decline in arable land have led to a reduction in per capita arable land from 2.61 mu to 0.99 mu. It is projected that by the end of the century, per capita arable land will further decrease to 0.77 mu.

The second set of figures concerns population and grain. In 1949, the region's total grain production was approximately 191 million kilograms, with per capita availability of 154 kilograms. By 1988, total grain production had increased to 525 million kilograms, with per capita availability of 236 kilograms. Over the span of 40 years, total grain production nearly doubled, but per capita availability only increased by 82 kilograms.

During the forum, representatives from various sectors provided detailed explanations and comparative analyses on issues such as population and employment, population and housing, population and education, as well as population and the environment, transportation, and public security. Governor Yang summarized, "The uncontrolled population growth trend has become the most serious factor hindering the region's production development and poverty alleviation efforts." He emphasized, "In the current rectification and rectification efforts, controlling the uncontrolled population growth is itself a way to reduce social demand and revitalize the mountain economy."

After the forum, the regional family planning commission further analyzed the main reasons for the region's high birth rate and natural growth rate, identifying the root causes. According to a sample survey, in 1988, over one-third of the region's total births were from early marriages and multiple births. If early marriages and multiple births were prevented, the birth rate could be reduced by 7.5 per thousand, bringing the region's birth rate down to 15.42 per thousand and the natural growth rate to below 10 per thousand. These two prominent issues are both the difficult and key points in the region's family planning work, as well as the crucial factors in reversing the long-standing backward situation in family planning.

In light of this, the regional party committee and the regional government decisively proposed the guiding ideology of "controlling early marriages and preventing multiple births." They also timely set the goal of sterilizing second births as the main target for preventing multiple births, achieving remarkable results, with 56.1% of the annual task completed in the first half of this year alone. At the same time, active and beneficial explorations have been made to control the reproduction of the region's 140,000 low-ability individuals.

Layer by layer, the calculations have not only awakened the region's top leaders but also the leaders at the county, township, and village levels, awakening everyone.

    算帐算醒了大家

    地处秦岭南麓的商洛地区，管辖六县一市，总人口二百二十三点二七万。这里山大沟深，土地贫瘠，封闭偏僻，是陕西省和全国最穷的贫困山区之一。有材料表明，一九八八年这个地区人均占有粮食和农民人均纯收入，比全国平均水平分别要低近三百斤和三百元，被经济学家称之为“双三百差距”。
    今年四月，地委书记冯煦初、行署专员杨永年在全国“十一亿人口日”座谈会上，跟大家一起算了两笔帐，陈述人口多、耕地少进一步加剧了商洛地区缺粮少钱的总体矛盾。
    一笔是人口与耕地帐。从解放初到如今，全区总人口净增近百万人，可耕地面积净减百万多亩。人口膨胀、耕地锐减，导致全区人均耕地由二点六一亩下降到零点九九亩。预测到本世纪末，人均耕地将减至零点七七亩。
    另一笔是人口与粮食帐。一九四九年全地区粮食总产量约一点九一亿公斤，人均占有一百五十四公斤。一九八八年粮食总产量上升到五点二五亿公斤，人均占有二百三十六公斤。四十年间，粮食总产量增长近二倍，而人均只增加八十二公斤。
    座谈会上，各界人士还就人口与就业，人口与住房，人口与教育，以及人口与环境、交通、社会治安等，从不同角度作了详细的阐述和算帐对比。杨专员总结说：“失控的人口出生态势，已成为全区发展生产、脱贫致富最严重的抵消力量和制约因素”。他大声疾呼：在当前的治理整顿工作中，控制人口的盲目增长，本身就是压缩社会总需求、繁荣山区经济的一条出路。
    会后，地区计划生育委员会进一步剖析了全地区人口出生率高、自然增长率高的主要原因，找到了症结所在。据抽样调查，一九八八年全地区总出生人口中，仅早育人口和多胎人口就占三分之一以上。如果杜绝早育和多胎，当年即可降低人口出生率七点五个千分点，使全区人口出生率降到千分之十五点四二，自增率降到千分之十以下。这两个突出问题，既是山区农村计划生育工作的难点和重点，也是扭转长期以来计划生育工作后进局面的关键所在。
    有鉴于此，地委和行署果断提出了“抓早育、堵多胎”的计划生育工作指导思想，并且适时把二胎结扎作为堵多胎的主攻目标，收到显著成效，今年上半年就完成全年任务的百分之五十六点一。与此同时，对控制全地区十四万低能人口的繁衍，也作了积极有益的探索。
    层层算帐，不仅算醒了地区主要负责人，也算醒了县、乡、村各级领导，算醒了大家。
