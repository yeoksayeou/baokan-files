The relationship between the Party and the people in Tianjin is much like the simple Hai River: it is neither particularly elegant nor dramatic. However, its power is not so much hidden as it is exposed. Whether facing arduous tasks or storms, it immediately unleashes a force like lightning and rainbows, revealing its greatest and most unyielding beauty.

During the turmoil of the spring and summer, a student erased the characters "people's" from the sign of the reception hall of the People's Government of Ping'an District, saying, "What people's government? It's a corrupt government!" Immediately, many people gathered around. An old worker pulled the student and said, "Kid, on what basis do you say this government is not the people's? You're crazy! Who says the Communist Party is bad? You're crazy!"

"The First Signal" and the Old Lady's "Philosophy"

The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee takes "everything for the people, relying on the people" as the fundamental guideline for all its work. Its theoretical basis is the Party's purpose and the philosophy of historical materialism. Tianjin has not simplified the separation of Party and government affairs. From the standpoint of the ruling party's position and nature, it emphasizes turning the Party's will into government action. Thus, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have turned "everything for the people" into a simple slogan: "do practical things"; as for "relying on the people," it is simplified by the masses and called "strength."

The first principle of "doing practical things" is: to treat the voice of the people as the "first signal." No matter how reasonable something is, if the people cannot accept it at the moment, it cannot be done.

On November 21, 1987, the Municipal People's Congress organized a dialogue between municipal leaders and people's representatives. A representative presented a carefully investigated and designed plan, pointing out that Tianjin's prices were too low, which would be at a disadvantage in competition, and proposed the method of "increasing subsidies and raising prices." The municipal leaders replied, "Prices are sensitive. Some need to be adjusted reasonably, but no matter how reasonable, if the people are not willing to accept it, we cannot easily move forward. We must maintain stability!" Applause erupted.

The second principle of "doing practical things" is: no matter how difficult it is, if it is something the people urgently need and the Party and government can accomplish with their greatest efforts, it must be done.

The Party Secretary and Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Wang Zhicheng, will never forget Li Ruihuan's criticism, nor will he forget the simple philosophy of the old lady.

It was also at this dialogue meeting. A representative said, "A few days ago, there was a shortage of gas supply for three consecutive days, and the fire could not be lit. When will the city ensure normal gas supply?" This stumped Wang Zhicheng.

Before 1985, this city had few households using gas, and the gas company's more than 2,000 employees had a relatively easy job. In two and a half years, more than 100,000 households in the city, 93% of them, used gas, and more than 10,000 employees were now so busy that they had no days or nights, yet there were still cases of gas shortages.

Wang Zhicheng spoke in a guilty tone, asking the people of the city to forgive their difficulties. He presented a pile of numbers, a pile of reasons, and a pile of plans. Li Ruihuan seemed to have no mercy for his subordinates, and his stern face became even more imposing due to excitement. He said, "You still haven't made it clear, and you haven't realized the severity of the gas issue. You should say when it will be solved, not list a bunch of numbers. Numbers can only be used when we study work. The old lady doesn't care about that. She only cares about why there is no gas when she lights the fire!"

At that time, the TV station was broadcasting live! Li Ruihuan's voice grew louder: "On behalf of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, I apologize to the people of the city! We guarantee that the problem will be solved quickly. Otherwise, change people, change the team, until everyone is changed!" Applause thundered!

Wang Zhicheng returned to the bureau, and some comrades were so aggrieved that they shed tears. Wang Zhicheng, however, pulled a long face and shouted, "What are you crying for! The one who was criticized is this director, not you. You just do it, what are you crying for? Being a Party member and a Communist official is to endure hardship and criticism. I, Wang Zhicheng, will work with everyone. If we don't make the old lady smile, we are not human!"

Good for Wang Zhicheng, in less than two months, the gas supply was normal. The hardships they endured, of course, were not known to those old ladies who made suggestions.

Big Things and Small Things

The relationship between "doing practical things" and "strength" is one of mutual dependence and mutual promotion. This dialectical relationship often appears in both the Party and the people, showing unexpected "philosophical phenomena": sometimes, the people think it is a small matter, but the Party and government treat it as a top priority and do it; sometimes, the Party and government encounter difficulties and are very troubled, but once the people are mobilized, it turns out to be a small matter and is quickly resolved.

The Tangshan earthquake in 1976 added many ruins to Tianjin, which was already quite dilapidated. By 1981, there were still 51,000 households living in temporary sheds. A folk song circulated among the people of Tianjin: "Tianjin has three oddities: tap water is salty, taking a bus is not as fast as walking, and temporary sheds are seen but not demolished." After visiting Tianjin, Comrade Wanli said painfully, "Tianjin is the dirtiest and most dilapidated city I have seen."

Every time it rained, the temporary sheds were flooded. Phone calls were made to the district committee and district government, and Party members and cadres wanted to cry but had no way. They organized people to help the masses pump out water. However, the masses were not grateful, saying, "You can only do this. What else can you do?" On June 30, Vice Mayor Liu Fengyan of Hexi District announced at a mass meeting, "Demolish the temporary sheds by the end of the year!" Laughter erupted from the audience, and someone shouted, "A task that hasn't been completed in five years, can it be done in five months this time? Go down, don't stand there and blow hot air without teeth aching!" On December 20, five months had passed, and the task that had not been completed in five years was completed. The masses, with tears in their eyes, said, "We believe, we believe."

Unexpectedly, as the temporary sheds were demolished, the doubts of the masses about the Party and government were also demolished.

In 1985, Hexi District decided to renovate the Beiyang Workshop. It was a group of buildings from 1920, known as the "three-level jump": the road was higher than the alley, the alley was higher than the courtyard, and the courtyard was higher than the room. Once, during a heavy rain, an old man living in the basement would have drowned if not for his loud voice.

There were 476 households here. The district racked its brains and only managed to vacate 4 sets of transition rooms. Deputy Secretary and Mayor Liu Fengyan of the District Committee walked onto the stage of the mass meeting with heavy steps, prepared to be booed off. He said slowly, "We guarantee that everyone will move into new homes within a year..." An old worker rushed forward and interrupted his words, shouting, "Comrades, the things the Party and government have done for us, we have all seen. Why have a meeting? Go back, everyone thinks for themselves!" Everyone responded in unison.

That night, the streets were bustling. Those who had relatives relied on relatives, and those who had friends relied on friends, each finding their own way. The district stopped cars at the door to send pregnant women, but the big-bellied women smiled and waved their hands, shuffling away; children took out the money they bought ice cream with and donated it to the cadres, and old ladies took out their "private money" and gave it to the children to rent rooms. Liu Fengyan reported to the municipal leaders in a voice choked with emotion, "It will take 15 days to move out!" The result was that it only took two days!

1,800 piles were planned to be completed in a few months, and the construction team worked day and night. There was a row of buildings just five or six meters away from the construction site! One day, a group of housewives came out from the building. They pooled their resources to buy cooking utensils and made water and food for the construction team. The workers were moved, saying, "We've never seen such a thing. Tired to death, we accept it." As a result, the task was completed in 18 days.

On December 26, the birthday of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China. The District Committee chose this day to cut the ribbon for the Beiyang Workshop becoming "Beiyang New Lane." When the municipal leaders cut the ribbon, the crowd shouted, "Long live the Communist Party!" A reporter captured this moving scene, titled it "Wish," and sent it to the municipal leaders. Comrade Li Ruihuan wrote on the back of the photo, "Justice lies in the hearts of the people."

Things became easier in the following two years. The previous year, the Tianjin Steel Wire Rope Factory workers' dormitories were renovated. It was a group of dangerous buildings from the early days of the founding of the nation. 230 million yuan was needed, but the city and district could only squeeze out 150 million yuan. How to fill the gap? The municipal and district leaders took the lead in donating money. The Party Secretary of the factory, Zhao Lianyuan, donated 1,000 yuan and wanted to sell the color TV and refrigerator prepared for his son's wedding, but was stopped by the district cadres. In a few days, 160,000 yuan was donated. It was still not enough. The people of Hexi District mobilized the masses for voluntary labor. Workers rushed to the construction site after work. The saved construction costs filled the budget gap. A 7-year-old "little artist" who was almost crushed before the demolition sent a painting to the Municipal Party Committee after moving into the new residence: a clever and lively little monkey, struggling to hold a giant peach. "What is a good situation? The 'officials' of the Communist Party do practical things for the people!"

In Tianjin, the best public image is "servant of the people." The masses evaluate cadres with nothing else, just by how many practical things they do. Since 1983, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have done 20 practical things for urban and rural people each year, and these are "parent projects," with thousands of "child projects." The annual work plans of district and street Party committees have titles such as "Doing X practical things in X year," and most of them are related to the people's eating, drinking, excretion, sleeping, and other aspects.

City residents go to work in factories, come home after work, and close the door to become one. Neighbors may not know each other for several years, and there may be those who do not know the person living downstairs. Within the scope of a district, the fame of a district mayor is often not as high as that of an ordinary actor. However, few people do not know Zhang Haosheng, the Deputy Secretary and Mayor of Ping'an District. He likes to "stroll around," and does not engage in "incognito visits." When talking to the masses, he immediately says, "I am the district mayor. If there are any difficulties, please say so."

On one day in August last year, the daytime temperature reached over 40 degrees Celsius, and at around 12 o'clock at night, there was a sudden thunderstorm and heavy rain. The heavens sent people a good night's sleep, but the lights in the district committee and district government building were suddenly bright. As usual, when encountering bad weather, the leaders rushed to the office. Soon, they divided their tasks: one group guarded the phone, one group went around the streets, and one group rushed to the "Evening News" to wait for visitors. Sure enough, a few people came to report that their houses were leaking. Soon, the responsible person from the district went to each home. The leaking houses were quickly repaired. Were there any more leaking houses? The next day, a survey found that out of 140,000 households, 14 were leaking, just one in ten thousand. Someone said, "Let the housing management department send someone to repair when they have time." Zhang Haosheng said, "It's not when they have time, but immediately. For us, it's one in ten thousand, but for the people whose houses are leaking, it's one hundred percent."

This district has a system: district-level cadres must spend one Saturday a month at the residents' committee to handle cases. They ensure that all 261 residents' committees are covered. An old man surnamed Feng said, "What is a good situation? The 'officials' of the Communist Party doing practical things for the people is a good situation!"

Tan Shaowen and Nie Bixiu's Plan

Li Ruihuan went to work in Beijing. Tan Shaowen and Nie Bixiu took over as the Municipal Party Secretary and Mayor, respectively. How do they view the "two for" policy? Tan Shaowen said, "The masses are the most lovable, their demands for the Party and government are not high; the masses are the most respectable, their 'strength' is so profound and righteous; the masses are also the most frightening, without the support of the masses, nothing can be done well. The masses, from the experience of 'water becoming sweet, roads becoming wider, and cities becoming more beautiful,' have strengthened their trust, support, and love for the Party and government. The strength lies in the hearts of the people. I and old Nie feel that to do a good job in Tianjin, the most fundamental thing is to take 'everything for the people, relying on the people' as the starting point and destination of work, and to persistently and wholeheartedly do practical things for the people."

The new secretary and mayor took office at a time of economic difficulties. They believe that the more difficult the situation, the more Party leaders should have the people in their hearts, do things for the people, and do everything for the people; the more difficult the situation, the more it is necessary to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and rely on the masses. At the beginning of their term, they went to grassroots enterprises to investigate and study, deeply understand the root causes of economic difficulties, and ask the masses for advice, ideas, and suggestions. They felt that many problems, when a few people pondered in a room, often had no solution, but when they went to the masses and let everyone come up with ideas and solutions, it would be like seeing flowers after a dark bamboo grove.

Doing practical things for the people requires money. In the current situation of local financial difficulties, can we continue to persist in doing practical things for the people? The Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee meeting chaired by Tan Shaowen and the Municipal Government Executive Meeting chaired by Nie Bixiu have discussed this issue many times. The consensus is that the masses will share the difficulties with the Party and government and will not make excessive demands. However, leaders should strive to do more practical things for the masses in any situation. Currently, we should especially strive to do things that do not cost money or cost less money but have great benefits, do things that the masses are most concerned about and most urgent, and do things that are within reach.

When Li Ruihuan went to Beijing, some people once doubted whether the new leadership could continue to do practical things as before. More than five months have passed, and everyone sees that the 20 practical things set at the beginning of the year have been completed or are about to be completed. The supply of cabbage is sufficient, the purchase of chimneys and stoves is more convenient than last year, and the basic living arrangements of the masses are relatively good.

Recently, the Municipal Party Committee has made eight decisions to streamline meetings, reduce documents, and reduce ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Meetings are greatly reduced, documents are greatly reduced, and ribbon-cutting ceremonies are greatly reduced. A large number of cadres have freed up energy and time to go deep into reality, investigate and study, and do practical things. The masses are happy to see that the new leadership has many new methods, and every method has not deviated from the basic guideline of "everything for the people, relying on the people."

    力量在于民心
    ——天津市党的工作纪实之一
    本报记者　杨传春
    天津市的党群关系很像这朴素的海河：不是特别典雅，也不惊心动魄。然而，它的能量却与其说是蕴藏着不如说是裸露着。无论是遇到艰巨的重任还是风浪的震动，它会马上暴发出掣电流虹的力，现出至大至刚的美。
    在春夏之交的动乱中，有个学生在和平区人民政府招待所的牌子上涂掉“人民”二字，说：“什么人民政府？腐败政府！”马上围过来许多群众。一个老工人拉着这个学生，说：“小子，你凭什么说咱这政府不是人民的？你啊，浑！谁说共产党不好？浑！”在某大学，当有人提出要打倒市委和市政府主要领导人时，马上有人颇有见识地反驳说：“天津市委和市政府在人民中享有很高威望，你反他们，找倒霉。”
    “第一信号”与老太太的“哲学”
    天津市委以“一切为了人民，一切依靠人民”为一切工作的基本思路，它的理论依据是党的宗旨和历史唯物主义的哲学。天津没有简单化地搞党政分家，从执政党的地位和性质出发，强调把党的意志化为政府的行动。于是，市委和市政府把“一切为了人民”化为一句简单不过的口号：“办实事”；至于“一切依靠人民”，则是由群众化简的，叫“作劲”。
    “办实事”的第一个原则是：把群众的呼声当作“第一信号”。群众一时接受不了的事情，有多少道理也不能办。
    1987年11月21日，市人大组织了一场市领导与人民代表的座谈对话。有个代表拿出了一份认真调查、精心设计的方案，指出天津市的物价太低，这在竞争中要吃大亏，提出“加补贴、涨物价”的办法。市领导回答说：“物价很敏感，有些需要合理调整，但是，不管多有理，群众还不愿意接受的时候，咱们就不能轻易动，要保持稳定！”哗……一片掌声。
    “办实事”的第二个原则是：群众急需办而党和政府经过最大努力能办成的事，不管多难也要办。
    市公用局党委书记、局长王志成永远忘不了李瑞环对他的批评，忘不了朴素得简直没多少道理可讲的老太太的“哲学”。
    也是在这个对话会上。一个代表说：“前些时连续三天煤气供气不足，点不着火，市里什么时候能保证供气正常？”这可难住了王志成。
    这个城市在1985年以前没有多少户居民用煤气，煤气公司2000多名职工工作比较轻松。两年半的时间里，全市100多万户居民93％用上了煤气，一万多职工如今尽管忙得没年没节、没日没夜，仍有断煤气的情况。
    王志成用内疚的口气请求全市人民原谅他们的困难，他提出了一堆数字、一堆原因、一堆打算。李瑞环对自己的部下似乎毫不爱怜，刚毅的脸因为激动更添了威严。他说：“你还是没说清楚，还没有认识到煤气的厉害。你要说什么时候解决，而不是罗列一大堆啰里啰嗦的数字。数字只能在我们研究工作时派用场。老太太不管那个，她只管一点火为什么没煤气！”
    当时，电视台正在现场直播！李瑞环的嗓门越来越高：“我代表市委、市政府向全市人民检讨！我们保证很快解决问题。否则，换人，换班子，直至全部换光！”哗——掌声如雷！
    王志成回到局里，有些同志委屈得流了泪，王志成却拉下脸，吼道：“嚷什么！挨批评的是我这个局长，不是你们。你们干就是了，委屈什么？做党员、做共产党的官，就是吃亏受气的。我王志成和大家一块干，不让老太太笑起来，不是人！”
    好一个王志成，不到两个月，煤气正常了。他们吃的什么苦，当然没有让那些提意见的老太太知道。
    大事与小事
    “办实事”与“作劲”的关系是相互依赖、相互促进的。这种辩证关系常在党和群众两个方面出现喜出望外的“哲学现象”：有时候，群众认为是小事一件，但党和政府却作为头等大事，办了；有时候，党和政府遇到困难，头疼得要命，但一惊动了群众，居然是小事一件，很快办好了。
    1976年的唐山大地震给本来就比较破旧的天津市添加了许多废墟。直到1981年，全市还有五万一千户住在临建棚里，天津市民中流传着一首顺口溜：“天津卫，三大怪：自来水腌咸菜，坐车不如走着快，临建棚见盖不见拆。”万里同志看了天津后痛心地说：“天津是我看到的城市中最脏、最破的。”
    每当下雨，临建棚里水汪汪一片。电话打到区委、区政府，党员和干部们直想哭，没办法。他们组织起来帮群众向外舀水。可是，群众不领情，说：“你们就会这个。还会干嘛？”6月底，河西区副区长刘峰岩在群众大会上宣布：“年内拆迁临建棚！”台下一片哄笑，有人高声说：“5年都没办成的事，这回5个月能办了？下去吧您，别站着吹牛不牙疼！”12月20日，5个月到了，5年没办成的事情办成了。群众含着泪花说：“信了，我们信了。”
    喜出望外的是：随着临建棚的拆掉，群众对党和政府的疑虑也拆掉了。
    1985年，河西区决定改建北洋工房。那是一片1920年的建筑，有名的“三级跳”：马路比胡同高，胡同比院里高，院里比房里高。有一次下大雨，一个住在地下室的孤老头要不是嗓门儿还算大，就淹死了。
    这里有476户，区里绞尽脑汁，只腾出了4套周转房，区委副书记、区长刘峰岩以沉重的步伐走上了群众大会的主席台，他做好了被轰下来的准备。他缓慢地说：“我们保证一年后让大家搬进新居……”，一个老工人抢上前去打断了他的话，喊道：“老少爷们，党和政府为咱们办的事，都见过了。还开什么会，回去吧，各想各的辙！”大家伙纷纷响应。
    晚上，车水马龙。投亲的投亲，靠友的靠友，各找各的辙。区里把小车停在门口送孕妇，大肚子们笑一笑，摆摆手，蹒跚着走了；小孩子掏出了买冰棍的钱献给干部，老太太们拿出“私房钱”交给孩子去租房。刘峰岩用激动的哭腔向市领导报告：“15天就可以搬完！”结果只用了两天！
    1800多根桩计划几个月内打完，施工队伍日夜不停。有一排楼房就离工地五六米！一天，从楼里走出一队家庭主妇，她们集资买了炊具，给施工队烧水做饭。工人们感动了，说：“没碰到过这样的事。累死，认了。”结果，18天完成了任务。
    12月26日，中国共产党的领袖毛泽东的诞辰。区委选择这一天为北洋工房成为“北洋新里”剪彩。当市领导剪断那根彩带时，人山人海中响起了“共产党万岁”的呼声！一个记者拍下了这激动人心的场面，命题为《心愿》，寄给了市领导。李瑞环同志在照片背后挥笔写下“公道自在人心”几个大字。
    这两年的事情更好办了。前年改建天津钢丝绳厂职工宿舍，那是一片建国初的危房。需要230万元，可是市和区只挤出了150万元。缺口怎么解决？市、区领导带头捐款，厂党委书记赵连元捐出1000元，还想把准备给儿子结婚用的彩电、冰箱卖掉，被区里的干部阻住了。几天功夫，捐献出16万元。还不够。河西区群众总动员，义务劳动。工人们下班后就匆匆往工地上跑。省下的施工费，堵住了预算缺口。一个在拆迁前差点被砸死的7岁“小画家”，进新居后给市委寄了一幅画：一个聪明、活泼的小猴儿，费力地抱了一个大寿桃。“嘛叫形势好？共产党的‘官’为百姓办实事！”
    在天津，最佳的公众形象是“公仆”。群众评价干部没别的，就是看他办的实事多不多。市委、市政府从1983年起每年为城乡人民办20件实事，而且是“母项目”，“子”项目则有几千件。区、街道的党委制订的年度工作计划，标题都是“××年办××件实事”，而且多半是有关群众吃喝拉撒睡的。
    城里人，上班进厂，下班回家，关起门来成一统，邻居好几年，还有楼下不认识楼上的。在一个区的范围内，往往一个区长不及一个普通演员的“知名度”高。可是和平区委副书记、区长张好生却很少有人不知道。他喜欢“闲逛”，而且不搞“微服私访”，与群众一交谈，出口就是“我是区长，有嘛困难尽管说”。
    去年8月的一天，白天气温达到了摄氏40多度，夜里12点多，忽然一阵闷雷，大雨倾盆。老天爷给人们送来了好觉，但是区委、区政府的大楼内却忽然灯火通明。像往常一样，一遇恶劣天气，领导们就赶到了办公室。很快分了工：一拨人守电话，一拨人走街串巷，一拨人直奔《今晚报》等候来访者。果然，来了几个群众反映房屋漏雨。很快，每一家都去了区里的负责人。漏雨的房子很快修好了。还有没有漏雨的呢？第二天一调查，14万户居民中有14户漏雨了，刚好是万分之一。有人说：“让房管部门得空派人修吧。”张好生说：“不是得空，而是立即。对我们来说是万分之一，对于漏雨的群众来说却是百分之百。”
    这个区有个制度：区级干部每月要用一个星期天到居委会挂牌办公。保证261个居委会全转到。一个姓冯的老大爷说：“嘛叫形势好？共产党的官为百姓办实事就叫形势好！”
    谭绍文和聂璧初的打算
    李瑞环调到中央工作了。谭绍文和聂璧初分别接任市委书记和市长。他们怎样看待“两为”方针呢？谭绍文说：“群众最可爱，他们对党和政府的要求并不高；群众最可敬，他们的‘作劲’是那样的深明大义；群众也最可怕，得不到群众支持，什么事情都办不好。群众从‘水变甜了，路变宽了，城变美了’的切身体会中增强了对党和政府的信任、拥护和支持。力量在于民心。我和老聂感到要把天津的工作做好，最根本的是把‘一切为了人民，一切依靠人民’作为工作的出发点和归宿，坚持不懈、尽心竭力地为人民办实事。”
    新的书记和市长，受命于经济困难之际。他们认为，越是困难，作为共产党的领导干部，越要心中装着人民，办事想着人民，一切为了人民；越是困难，越需要动员群众，组织群众，依靠群众。他们上任伊始，就到基层企业调查研究，深入了解经济困难的症结所在，请群众出主意、想办法、提建议。他们感到，许多问题，少数人在屋子里冥思苦想常常是一筹莫展，而到群众中去，让大家出主意、想办法，就会柳暗花明。
    为人民办实事需要钱。在当前地方财政相当困难的情况下，还能不能坚持不懈地为人民办实事呢？谭绍文主持召开的市委常委会，聂璧初主持召开的市政府常务会，都曾多次研究讨论这个问题。一致的看法是，群众是会与党和政府共度难关的，不会提出过高要求。但是，领导者在任何情况下都应该争取多为群众办实事。当前特别要努力办好那些不花钱、少花钱而又受益大的事，办好群众最关心、最紧迫的事，办好可望而又可及的事。
    李瑞环调到北京之初，有些群众曾经怀疑新的班子是否还能一如既往地办实事。五个多月过去了，大家看到年初定的20件实事都圆满地完成或接近完成。大白菜供应充足，烟筒、炉子比去年购买还方便，群众的基本生活都安排得比较好。
    最近，市委作出精简会议、精减文件的八条决定。会议大减，文件大减，剪彩大减。大批干部腾出精力和时间，深入实际，调查研究，办实事。群众高兴地看到新班子有很多新招法，而招招都没有离开“一切为了人民，一切依靠人民”这条基本思路。
