Local regions are diligently implementing the spirit of the National Minority Poverty Alleviation Conference and are determined to fight a decisive battle in poverty alleviation work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: Relevant autonomous regions and provinces are actively taking measures to conscientiously implement and carry out the spirit of the National Minority Poverty Alleviation Conference, determined to fight a decisive battle in poverty alleviation work.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in implementing the spirit of the conference, has decided to have the poverty alleviation department dispatch personnel to investigate households that have not yet solved their food and clothing problems, identify difficult villages and households, and provide targeted solutions to help them become prosperous.

The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided to gradually shift the focus of poverty alleviation work to ethnic minority areas and have formulated corresponding measures. First, 12 new counties will be added to the list of key poverty-stricken counties supported by the province. Second, strengthen unified leadership. Third, allocate 100 million yuan from the funds supporting the development of underdeveloped regions and provide 100 million yuan in provincial financial interest-free loans, concentrating these funds on the 12 newly added key poverty alleviation counties.

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, while formulating corresponding measures, is hastening the implementation of the poverty alleviation project for mountainous areas—promoting the 300,000 mu (approximately 20,000 hectares) plastic film-covered corn technology plan. Additionally, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Guizhou, Yunnan, Gansu, Jilin, Anhui, and Shaanxi provinces and autonomous regions have also proposed many corresponding opinions and poverty alleviation measures.
