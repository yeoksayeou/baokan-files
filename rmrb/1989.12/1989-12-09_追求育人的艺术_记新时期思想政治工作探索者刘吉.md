At 11 a.m. on December 1, in the Xinhua Bookstore at Wangfujing in Beijing, Liu Ji signed and sold his recent work on ideological and political education, "From Confusion to Clarity." Within one hour, all 100 copies of the 800-page book were sold out...

Political work has been "materialized" in some units, ideological education has been neglected in some units, some young people are experiencing a "crisis of faith," and some political workers are "unsettled." These new situations and problems that have emerged since the reform and opening up have been the subjects that Liu Ji has been tirelessly exploring for many years.

Liu Ji, currently the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the National University of Defense Technology, discovered in practice that some comrades have more lamentations than research when dealing with the new situations and problems that have emerged during the reform and opening up. For this reason, he conducted extensive investigations and research, visiting hundreds of factories, schools, military units, and government agencies across the country, compiling nearly 10,000 questions raised by the masses, and leading and participating in a questionnaire survey of 15,000 college students from 47 universities nationwide. From these, he selected nearly 100 difficult problems that grassroots cadres generally found challenging and conducted persistent research to solve them.

In the process of exploring the art of education, he did not engage in closed-door research but insisted on following the mass line, making friends with the masses, and combining effective ideological and political work with methods for solving problems. He also combined the inheritance of fine traditions with reform and innovation. In 1982, when he was the Party Committee Secretary of an enterprise, he proposed that ideological and political work should "clear the leftist influence" and "make friends," and actively made friends with backward and delinquent youth, saving a batch of delinquent youth. From 1983 to 1984, he proposed "two-way guidance" and pioneered the practice of using "dialogue" to conduct ideological and political work. In 1985, he proposed to create a "science of ideological and political engineering," and that ideological and political work should take the new path of "inheritance, borrowing, reform, and innovation." In 1986, he proposed that ideological and political work should strive for positive education and should be "democratized, scientific, artistic, and open." In 1987, he proposed the "six principles of ideological and political work in the primary stage," and so on. Keeping pace with the reform, he played a series of melodies that touched people's hearts on the stage of the art of education. He has published "Thoughts of the Times," "The Art of Dialogue," "Liu Ji Answers 700 Questions from Students," and other 10 books totaling 1.6 million words. He has also published more than 100 articles in newspapers and magazines nationwide, such as "Worthy of Thought and Discussion," "Liu Ji in Dialogue with Science University Students," and "Sincerely Befriend Backward Students and Warmly Help Backward Students Transform." At the same time, he edited 4 textbooks on "College Students' Ideological Cultivation" and 10 books in the "Youth Study Series" totaling approximately 3 million words.

Researching problems is to solve problems, which is the guiding ideology of Liu Ji's work. Over the years, he has been accumulating knowledge and drawing on the wisdom of the masses with a sense of urgency, taking the resolution of ideological problems that society and the masses are generally concerned about as his research goal, and using knowledge from sociology, philosophy, psychology, literature, education, and communication studies to explore and answer many major problems in real life in a comprehensive and integrated manner.

Since 1987, when he took up the position of Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of China University of Science and Technology, his strong sense of responsibility made him regard the education of shaping and cultivating a new generation of college students with lofty ideals as his duty. He had extensive "dialogues" with students and wrote dozens of articles such as "Reflections After the Turmoil," "Thoughts and Choices of Contemporary College Students," and "Desk Literature and the Spiritual World of College Students." At the beginning of this year, he wrote the article "Shaping a Modern Perfect Personality—Thoughts on the Healthy Development of Contemporary College Students," which was published in the fifth and sixth issues of the Liaoning "Communist" magazine, in response to the influence of bourgeois liberalization on college students, who, on the one hand, demand democracy one-sidedly, and on the other hand, expose obvious weaknesses in participating in politics and administration. Just after the party and the state had just ended a severe political struggle, he did not rest for a day and immediately engaged in the work of editing the book "Reviewing the Past, Thinking About the Future," a series of lectures on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Two months later, this 250,000-word book became the first college political course textbook published nationwide after the turmoil was suppressed and was designated by the Hunan Provincial Education Commission as the unified textbook for political courses in all colleges and universities in the province.

In the journey of exploring the art of education and solving the difficulties of education, his work has been widely respected and welcomed by society, achieving fruitful results. In recent years, he has given more than 400 lectures across the country and received more than 5,000 letters from the masses. He has been awarded the title of outstanding political worker by the Ministry of Textile Industry, outstanding political worker nationwide, one of the top 100 outstanding young ideological educators nationwide, and the masses say he has a "personality force."

    追求育人的艺术
    ——记新时期思想政治工作探索者刘吉
    湘均
    12月1日上午11时在北京王府井新华书店，由刘吉同志签名销售他的思想政治教育近作《从困惑中走出》。100本800页的大书1个小时内全部销完……
    政治工作在一些单位被“物化”，思想教育在一些单位遭冷落，一些青年中出现“信仰危机”，一些政治工作者“不安心”，……这些改革开放后出现的新情况和新问题，是刘吉多年来苦苦探求的课题。
    现任国防科技大学政治部副主任的刘吉大校在实践中发现，对待改革开放中出现的新情况、新问题，一些同志嗟叹有余、研究不足。为此，他进行了广泛的调查研究，先后走访了全国数百家工厂、学校、部队、机关，整理群众提出的问题近万个，主持并参加了对全国47所高校、15000名大学生的问卷调查，从中选出近百个基层干部普遍感到棘手的难题，进行坚持不懈的攻关研究。
    在探讨育人艺术的过程中，他不搞关门研究，而是坚持走群众路线，与群众广交朋友，把卓有成效的思想政治工作与研究解决问题的方法结合起来，把继承优良传统与改革创新结合起来。1982年，担任企业党委书记的他，提出思想政治工作要“清左”、“交朋友”，并主动与后进、失足青年交朋友，挽救了一批失足青年；1983年至1984年又提出“双向疏导”，率先提倡和实践用“对话”的方式开展思想政治工作；1985年提出要创建“思想政治工程学”，思想政治工作要走“继承、借鉴、改革、创新”的新路子；1986年提出思想政治工作要力求进行正面教育，要“民主化、科学化、艺术化、开放化”；1987年提出“初级阶段思想政治工作六原则”等。伴着改革的节拍，他在育人艺术的舞台上，弹奏出一曲曲拨动人们心弦的旋律，他先后出版了《时代的思考》、《对话的艺术》、《刘吉答学生700问》等10本160万字的书；在全国报刊发表了《值得思考与探讨的回答》、《刘吉与科大学生对话》、《真心与后进为友、热情帮后进转化》等100多篇论文；同时主编了“高校大学生思想修养”教材4本和“青年学丛书”10本约300万字。
    研究问题就是为了解决问题，这是刘吉同志从事这项工作的指导思想。多年来他以只争朝夕的精神进行着知识的积累和汲取群众智慧，把解答社会和群众中普遍关心的思想问题作为自己研究的目标，融汇贯通地应用社会学、哲学、心理学、文学、教育学、传播学等多学科知识，来探讨和回答现实生活中的许多重大问题。
    从1987年他出任中国科技大学党委副书记后，强烈的责任感使他把塑造、培养有远大理想的新一代大学生的教育视为己任，与学生进行了广泛的“对话”，先后写出了《学潮过后的反思》、《当代大学生的思考与选择》、《“课桌文学”与大学生心灵世界》等数十篇文章。今年初，他针对大学生受资产阶级自由化影响，一方面片面地要求民主，一方面在参政议政中又暴露出明显的弱点，写了《塑造现代完美人格——关于当代大学生健全发展的思考》的文章，发表在今年第五、第六期的辽宁《共产党员》杂志上。就在党和国家刚刚结束了一场严峻的政治斗争后，他顾不上休息一天，就投入主编《回顾过去、思考未来》的坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化系列讲座一书的工作。两个月后这本25万字的书，成为动乱平息后全国率先出版的第一本高校政治课教材，被湖南省教委定为全省大中专院校政治课的统一教材。
    在探讨育人艺术、解决育人难题的征途中，他的工作得到了社会的广泛尊重和欢迎，取得了丰硕成果。近年来他先后在全国各地作报告400余场，收到群众来信5000余封。他先后被评为纺织工业部优秀政工干部、全国优秀政治工作者，全国百名优秀青年思想教育工作者，群众称他有一种“人格的力量”。
