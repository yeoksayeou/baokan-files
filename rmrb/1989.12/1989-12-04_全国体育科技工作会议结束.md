The four-day 1989 National Sports Science and Technology Conference concluded successfully today in Tai'an, Shandong Province.

Through discussions, participants deepened their understanding of the policy that "the revitalization of sports relies on the progress of science and technology, and sports science and technology must serve the development of sports." Attendees agreed that developing sports science and technology requires deepening the reform of the science and technology system, introducing a competitive mechanism, and establishing an effective operational mechanism that integrates sports science and technology with sports practice.

The conference emphasized that sports commissions at all levels should strengthen the macro-management of science and technology work, formulate strategic development plans, policies, and regulations for sports science and technology, mobilize the enthusiasm of scientific and technological workers, and do a good job in guiding and coordinating sports scientific research work. Sports training management departments and various teams should establish the awareness of respecting science and relying on technological progress, actively welcome the introduction of science and technology into training, create convenient working conditions for scientific and technological personnel, and facilitate the scientific monitoring and control of training, thereby improving athletic performance.
