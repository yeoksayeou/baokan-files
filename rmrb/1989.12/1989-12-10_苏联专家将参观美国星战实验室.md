The chief U.S. representative to the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms talks, Paul Nitze, announced in Geneva on December 8 that a delegation of Soviet experts will visit the United States next week to tour two laboratories involved in research for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), commonly known as the "Star Wars" program.

Nitze said at a press conference that the visit was proposed during a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming last month. He added that the invitation to Soviet experts to visit the U.S. further demonstrates the openness of the U.S. Star Wars program and will facilitate negotiations on predictive measures proposed by the United States.

    苏联专家将参观美国星战实验室
    参加美苏战略武器谈判的美方首席代表伯特八日在日内瓦宣布，一个苏联专家代表团将于下周访问美国，参观实施星球大战计划研究的两个实验室。
    伯特在记者招待会上说，这次访问是由美国国务卿贝克上个月在美国怀俄明州会见苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽时提出的。他说，邀请苏联专家访美进一步表明了美国星球大战计划的公开性，并将推动由美国提出的关于预测性措施的谈判。
