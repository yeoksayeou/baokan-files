    Recently, the Qiaodong District Family Planning Commission in Shijiazhuang City approved 90 single-daughter households in Yitang Village to have a second child according to provincial regulations. The birth quotas were issued just a few days ago, but 19 women voluntarily returned their second-child birth quotas to the district authorities.

    Why is this? Recently, reporter Jing Ru Yue and the district family planning director, Liang Guirong, went to Yitang Village to find out.

    Zhang Shumei, 38, who works in a village-run enterprise, said: “I don’t want a second child. Some people say I’m foolish. Others are finding ways to get a second-child quota, but I’ve decided to have only one child. Life is better now. Even if I had just one daughter, I wouldn’t worry about old age. Besides, my husband and I both work in the village-run enterprise and want to do more while we’re young. We don’t have the energy to raise another child.”

    He Chunju, 28, has a 4-year-old daughter and also returned her second-child quota. She said: “I often listen to the radio and watch TV. The village also organizes study sessions. I know our country is facing a population crisis and has many difficulties. Young people should respond to the call and share the nation’s burdens. I initially hesitated to return the quota, fearing my father-in-law wouldn’t understand, but he actually supported us and encouraged us to return it.”

    He Chunju is the fifth daughter-in-law of the Zhang family. Her four brothers-in-law are also single-daughter households, but only He Chunju and her husband meet the conditions for a second child.

    He Chunju’s father-in-law, 60-year-old Zhang Shiyi, said: “Someone joked with me about the Zhang family dying out, but I say he’s narrow-minded. Boys and girls are the same. We have five daughters, and they’re as good as gold!” Old Zhang also said: “I’m not saying I don’t want grandchildren, but I see our country has difficulties. The country is like a big family, and too many people make life hard. I’ve suffered enough with many children. I’ve spent a lifetime building houses and marrying off daughters-in-law for my five sons. My wife died early, and without the country’s relief, we wouldn’t have today. Now, let the children respond to the country’s call, have fewer children, and share some of the country’s burdens.”

    Village Party Secretary Qi Jianxin said that in recent years, the village has become rich, with per capita income exceeding 1,500 yuan, more than ten times what it was in 1980. No one has overproduced or violated family planning regulations, and the village has been rated as an advanced unit every year. The 19 single-daughter couples in the village voluntarily not having a second child shows a spirit and indicates that with the improvement of rural material and cultural living standards and the influence of urbanization, people’s concepts of childbearing are changing.

    It is understood that Yitang Village has implemented a series of measures to alleviate people’s concerns. The village implements a retirement system at 60 years old, with a monthly retirement pension of over 30 yuan. It has built a nursing home and a maternal and child health station, ensuring that people have support for birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability.

    生产发展了　文化提高了　观念变化了
    义堂村19名妇女不要二胎娃
    据新华社石家庄12月3日电　（记者景如月）前不久，石家庄市桥东区计划生育委员会根据省有关规定，批准义堂村90个独女户可以生育二胎。生育指标下去没几天，竟有19名妇女主动找到区里，退回了二胎生育指标。
    这是为什么？日前，记者和区计生委主任梁桂荣一起来到义堂村探个究竟。
    在村办企业工作的38岁的张淑梅说：“俺不要二胎娃，有人说你咋这么傻？别人托后门找路子还弄不到二胎指标呢。俺早就拿定主意只要一个孩。如今日子好过了，别说有一个女儿，就是没有孩子，老了也不用发愁。再说俺和孩子他爸都在村办企业上班，还想趁年青多干点事。哪有精力再养孩子。”
    28岁的何春菊，有个4岁的女孩，也退了二胎指标。她说：“俺常听广播、看电视，村里也常组织学习，知道咱国家面临人口危机，困难大。青年人应该响应号召，为国分忧。俺起初退指标还怕公公想不通，没想到老人却来做我们的工作，劝我们退了。”
    何春菊是张家五儿媳，她的4个大伯哥也都是独女户，可只有何春菊两口子够二胎生育条件。
    何春菊的公公、60岁的张世义老汉说：“有人逗我说张家要绝后，我却说他思想不开通。男孩、女孩还不一样？咱家有五朵金花，金不换哩！”张老汉还说：“我不是不想抱孙子，是看咱国家有困难。这国家就像一家人，人多了日子不好过。我吃够了孩子多的苦，给他们哥五个盖了一辈子房、娶了一辈子媳妇。孩子娘死得早，以前要不是国家常给救济，哪能有今天？现在让孩子们响应国家号召，少生几口人，也算替国家分担一点困难吧。”
    村党支部书记齐建新说，这些年村里富了，人均收入1500元以上，比1980年增加了10倍多，可没有一个人超生、违反计划生育，年年被评为先进单位。村里19对独女夫妻主动不生二胎，这说明了一种风格，也说明随着农村物质、文化生活水平的提高和城市化的影响，人们的生育观念正在发生变化。
    据了解，义堂村制定了一系列措施以解除人们的后顾之忧。村里实行60岁退休制度，退休费每月30多元；建了敬老院、妇幼保健站，使生、老、病、死、伤、残，都有了依靠。
