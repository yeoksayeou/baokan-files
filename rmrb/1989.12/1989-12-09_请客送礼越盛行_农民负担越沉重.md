    As gift-giving becomes more prevalent, farmers' burdens increase

    From a survey of 100 households in 10 townships in our county, it was found that in 1984, the average amount spent on gifts per person was 10.92 yuan, and per household was 57.88 yuan. By 1988, the average amount spent on gifts per person had reached 40.59 yuan, and per household had reached 218.51 yuan. Over five years, the amount spent on gifts per person increased by 2.86 times, and per household by 2.72 times, while the average net income per person only increased by 1.65 times. The growth rate of gift-giving expenses far exceeds the growth rate of per capita net income.

    Currently, in rural areas, among relatives, friends, and clans, the occasions for gift-giving are numerous, and the "favors" exchanged are becoming heavier. The minimum is 20 yuan, and the maximum can be several hundred yuan. Farmers are very resentful about this, but no one can resist it. It is the "favor" that is heavier than debt.

    In fact, no one benefits from gift-giving; it is just a feast and a celebration, but the aftermath is endless.

    The recipient of the gift is left with an unrepayable debt of favor. If you reciprocate, it is not considered polite. If you hold a banquet this year with 20 tables, you owe a debt of favor to 200 people, and each debt must be repaid. If one generation cannot repay it, the next generation will continue to repay it.

    The giver also has a hard time. In Xixiang Township, a farmer spent 2,500 yuan on gifts last year, while his annual net income was only 3,128 yuan. As a result, he had to borrow 700 yuan.

    It hinders the development of agricultural production. In the survey of 100 households, the total production expenditure last year was over 77,000 yuan, while the total expenditure on gifts was over 21,000 yuan. Some households had to cut back on production funds to give gifts, resulting in reduced agricultural output.

    It affects the improvement of family life. To give gifts, they are reluctant to buy clothes for their children or add necessary living items.

    It increases social instability. Currently, in rural areas, young people give betrothal gifts and spend a lot of money on weddings. We have learned from some townships that generally, young people need over 30,000 yuan from engagement to marriage. Such a grand affair is difficult for most farmers to afford. Some young men cannot come up with so much money and are afraid of breaking up with their beloved, so they seek illegal means to obtain money. As a result, they enter the bridal chamber today and the prison tomorrow, harming society and the family.

### 请客送礼越盛行  农民负担越沉重

    请客送礼越盛行  农民负担越沉重
    从对我县10个乡100户农民的抽样调查看，1984年人均送礼10.92元，户均送礼57.88元；1988年人均送礼达40.59元，户均送礼达218.51元。5年时间，农民人均送礼增长2.86倍，户均送礼增长2.72倍，而农民人均纯收入只增长1.65倍。送礼支出的增长速度，大大超过人均纯收入的增长速度。
    现在农村中，亲戚朋友、宗族之间，请客送礼名目繁多，“人情”越送越重，少则20元，多则数百元。农民们对此都非常气愤，但谁也无法抵制，正是“人情”重于债。
    事实上，请客送礼谁也没有受益，只是吃喝一顿，热闹一场，结果后患无穷。
    受礼者欠下还不完的人情债。来而不往非礼也，如果你今年操办喜事，摆酒20桌，那欠下200人的“人情债”，一笔一笔都要还，一代还不了，子孙接着还。
    送礼者，日子也不好过。溪垟乡有一户农民去年送礼支出现金2500元，而他全年纯收入只有3128元，结果只好借款700元。
    阻碍农业生产发展。百户农民调查，去年生产总支出7.7万多元，而送礼总支出2.1万多元。有的农户为了送礼而克扣了生产资金，结果使农业减了产。
    影响家庭生活改善。为送礼，舍不得给孩子做衣服，添置必要的生活用品。
    增加了社会不安定因素。目前农村青年订婚送彩礼，结婚办喜事费用惊人。我们从一些乡镇了解到，一般青年从订婚到结婚共需3万多元。这样的排场，对多数农民来说，难以办到。有的男青年拿不出那么多钱，又怕和心爱的姑娘告吹，于是就寻找歪门邪道，获取不义之财。结果，今日进洞房，明日进牢房，危害社会，危害家庭。
