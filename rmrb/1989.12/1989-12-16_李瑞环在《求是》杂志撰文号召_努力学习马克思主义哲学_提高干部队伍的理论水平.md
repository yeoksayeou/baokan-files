Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th.

CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan has published an article titled "Efforts to Study Marxist Philosophy" in the 24th issue of *Seeking Truth*. The article states that studying Marxist philosophy is of particular importance and significance for the Party to consolidate and adhere to the Marxist line of seeking truth from facts re-established at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and to better lead the people of the entire nation in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The article is divided into three parts: 1) Advocating that everyone studies some philosophy; 2) Insisting on combining theory with practice; 3) Striving to create conditions for study.

Li Ruihuan says in the article that studying philosophy and mastering a scientific worldview and methodology is necessary for completing all current tasks. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the new central leadership has organized the implementation of the resolutions of the plenary session in a resolute and effective manner, and the overall situation is developing towards further stabilization. However, it must be recognized that the tasks ahead are arduous, the difficulties are numerous, the contradictions are complex, and the situation is severe. We must have a full understanding and adequate mental preparation for this. How to correct the chaotic thoughts and theories caused by bourgeois liberalization, how to truly straighten out people's thoughts and emotions after the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, how to both seriously carry out the investigation and rectification work and unite the vast majority, how to insist on economic construction as the center in actual work, how to unite the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up in the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, how to actually do a few things that satisfy and please the people, how to implement the fight against corruption and strengthen clean governance, how to adjust the economy with a reform spirit, how to carry out the austerity policy without affecting the momentum of reform and opening up, and so on. All these are both practical problems and theoretical problems. Their correct resolution requires the use of Marxist philosophy as a great tool of cognition, adhering to seeking truth from facts, washing away idealist spirits, overcoming subjectivity and one-sidedness, and preventing and avoiding falling into another one-sidedness when correcting one bias.

The article says that calmly summarizing the past and thinking about the future is an extremely important topic that Comrade Xiaoping has put forward to the entire Party. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the 10 years of reform and opening up, the Party has led the people of the entire nation to achieve internationally recognized achievements through hard work, accumulating very precious experience; in this process, serious errors and deviations have also appeared, with profound lessons. We should follow the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speech, seriously conduct a summary, not to be fooled by confusion, not to gain from confusion, and turn it into the spiritual wealth of the Party and the people. Summarizing historical experience is a process of rising from sensory cognition to rational cognition, a process of practice, cognition, and then practice and cognition again. To truly summarize the historical activities of the people in the 10 years of reform and opening up and modernization construction in an objective manner, we must not avoid mentioning mistakes because of great achievements, nor deny achievements because of exposing mistakes; when affirming, protecting, and nurturing the sprouts of new things with tenacious vitality, we should not forget to remove the remnants of old things attached to them; when making decisive decisions on the current two-difficult choices, we should consider both the past and the future, so that they have a positive impact on the overall situation and lay some groundwork for future development. To do this, we cannot do without the great tool of cognition that is Marxist philosophy.

The great significance of theory also lies in its ability to scientifically foresee the future, so that our work and actions proceed in the correct direction and towards the correct goals. Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the line, policies, and strategies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and the "three-act play" of our country's development strategy have depicted a bright future, planned a grand goal, and pointed out the direction of advancement. However, to concretize these general principles and achieve the expected goals, we still face a vast realm of necessity. To overcome blindness, enhance consciousness, explore laws, and increase foresight, we must also use Marxist philosophy to guide us.

Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that this year's turmoil and rebellion in our country have an international background. Some political forces in Western countries have taken advantage of the difficulties and setbacks encountered by socialist countries in construction and reform to advocate that the communist movement has "collapsed" and can be "defeated without a fight," and have been scheming to implement a "peaceful evolution" strategy against socialist countries. This international background also affects our domestic and Party situations. Some people openly advocate that the attempt and failure of socialism are a great "legacy" of the 20th century, while others openly issue so-called "private property declarations." To refute these fallacies powerfully and correctly understand the issue of who is superior and who is inferior, who wins and who loses between socialism and capitalism, and to firmly hold our own beliefs in socialism and communism, relying solely on naive class sentiments and personal experiences is far from enough. We must rely on the power of theory, and so far, only Marxism has scientifically and irrefutably revealed the objective laws of the development of society, that capitalism must perish and communism must triumph.

The reason for Comrade Zhao Ziyang's mistakes is multifaceted, but from the perspective of epistemology, it is subjectivity separating from objectivity, that is, separating from national conditions and reality, violating the thought line of seeking truth from facts. For example, despite the obvious inflation, he still emphasized that inflation is "inevitable"; despite the significant weakening of ideological and political work in enterprises, he still advocated for "reform"; despite the widespread corruption and bribery that had aroused the indignation of the masses, he still emphasized that corruption is inevitable, and so on. These incorrect propositions that refuse to correctly recognize reality have only met with resistance and opposition from the vast number of cadres and the masses. Since Comrade Zhao Ziyang took charge of the central work, he has passively opposed the policy of combating bourgeois liberalization, seriously neglected Party building, spiritual civilization construction, and ideological and political work, with serious consequences. Those within and outside the Party who engage in bourgeois liberalization have attempted to transplant the political and economic systems and values of Western capitalism to China, which is a ridiculous proposition that goes against the tide of history and is bound to fail.

The article says that strengthening Marxist philosophical education is a strategic measure to improve the overall quality of the cadre team. Whether they are cadres from schools or those trained through practical work, they all have a need to make up for lost time. Only in this way can we resist the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization, prevent and overcome dogmatism and narrow empiricism, continuously enhance the principles, systematicness, foresight, and creativity in our work, and improve our leadership level. Studying philosophy well can help in learning, mastering, and developing other Marxist scientific theories. We master Marxist philosophy, which helps us understand and master Marxist political economy and scientific socialism, and also helps in developing these two theories in practice. We propose to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. What is socialism with Chinese characteristics? It is the combination of Marxist basic principles with modern Chinese construction. Without seriously studying Marxist philosophy, we cannot talk about combination, nor can we talk about building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The article emphasizes that historical experience proves that the improvement of the Party's philosophical level can greatly promote the vigorous development of the Party's cause. In our Party's history, there have been two Marxist philosophical study activities that have had a great positive impact. One occurred during the Yan'an Rectification Movement before the founding of the nation, and the other occurred during the period from the beginning of the Truth Criterion Debate in 1978 to the transition to comprehensive reform. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee produced the third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Today, the situation and tasks facing our Party are quite different from those of ten years ago. We have many favorable conditions. Comrade Xiaoping and other old revolutionaries are still alive, the line since the Third Plenary Session of the 11st Central Committee is correct, the road to building socialism with Chinese characteristics has been opened, and our country's economic strength and various aspects of work experience have also been accumulated. However, the difficulties we must overcome, the contradictions we face, and the complexity of the problems are absolutely not to be underestimated. Especially this year's political turmoil has exposed many serious problems within our Party, and solving these problems is certainly not a matter of a day or two. In the 1990s that are about to come, our tasks are arduous, and the challenges we face are severe. From the central to local and various units, a large number of new cadres have already or will soon take up leadership positions, taking over from the old comrades of the previous two generations. Taking over, first and foremost, is to take over Marxism. That is, to ensure that Marxism in China has successors and is firmly held and developed in the new practice of socialist modernization construction, achieving new victories. At this important historical juncture, it is particularly important and urgent to solemnly propose the task of the entire Party studying Marxist theory and philosophy.

The article emphasizes that we should focus on studying the philosophical works of Comrade Mao Zedong and the works of Comrade Xiaoping and other old revolutionaries that contain rich philosophical thoughts. This is not only because these works are easy to understand and we are relatively familiar with their historical background, but more importantly, they themselves are brilliant gems in the treasure trove of Marxist philosophy. In particular, Comrade Mao Zedong's military works, such as "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" and "On Prolonged War," provide us with the most brilliant examples of applying and developing Marxist epistemology and dialectics in practice, which we should pay more attention to.

In discussing the insistence on combining theory with practice, the article says that this time, whether the study of philosophy can be carried out, insisted on, and deepened to achieve solid results depends on the key point of rectifying the academic style. The issue of academic style is an issue of attitude towards Marxist theory. During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Comrade Mao Zedong once listed academic style alongside Party style for rectification, proposing that incorrect academic style is a manifestation of lack of Party spirit or incomplete Party spirit, which played an extremely important role in promoting the study of Marxism at that time. This time, we must emphasize from the beginning the insistence on and promotion of the good academic style of combining theory with practice that our Party has always advocated.

The article emphasizes that Marxism is the universal truth of cognition and transformation of the world. We study Marxism not for show, nor because it has some mystery, but because it is the science that leads our cause to victory. We value Marxist philosophy precisely because it can guide action. Studying it and not using it distorts the nature of Marxism, deviates from the purpose of studying Marxism, and is called an incorrect attitude. Marxist philosophy is a discipline with strong Party spirit, a thought weapon for the proletariat to seek liberation. Class nature and practicality are its two prominent features. Only with a strong sense of revolutionary cause and a heart full of enthusiasm for serving the people, can one honestly and diligently combine theory with practice and truly master Marxist philosophy.

The article says that combining theory with practice can not only help and deepen our understanding of book knowledge but also help us correctly recognize and solve practical problems. Therefore, we must insist on reading, insist on combining theory with practice, organically combine the process of work with understanding, verifying, and applying theory, combine the process of reading and studying with researching and solving work problems, and in short, combine learning with work, truly achieving the goal of "reading is learning, using is also learning, and more importantly, learning." In this way, the contradiction between learning and work in terms of time can be better solved, and thus the issue of combining theory with practice is also a key issue of whether to insist on learning.

The article proposes that combining theory with practice, especially with the actual experience of the past, and learning from historical experience, is an important way to study and apply theory. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, we have achieved internationally recognized achievements. The Chinese people have created this history, experienced countless difficulties and setbacks, and paid a huge price and sacrifice, which can be said to be a 40-year period rich in experience and lessons. For middle and senior cadres, studying philosophical principles in conjunction with this history not only has great theoretical significance but also has great practical significance. In these 40 years, two decades are particularly worth noting. One is the "Cultural Revolution" decade from 1966 to 1976, and the other is the decade of reform and opening up from 1979 to 1989. Without understanding the former decade, it is difficult to correctly understand the latter decade. The former decade, the "Cultural Revolution," caused great suffering to our Party and people from the perspective of the root cause of epistemology, which was the rampant spread of idealism and the rampant spread of metaphysics. The latter decade, the decade of reform and opening up, has brought about extremely extensive and profound changes to our country, society, people, and our Party. Therefore, learning in conjunction with this history not only helps us deepen our understanding of philosophical principles but also helps us enhance our awareness and firmness in executing the Party's basic line of "one center and two basic points." By unifying the study of philosophy with the summary of experience, the process of discussing the gains and losses of work can become a process of studying, applying, and researching philosophical theory, and the theoretical study of leading cadres can present a pleasing situation of a virtuous cycle of deepening theoretical study, improving work level, and increasing awareness.

Emphasizing the combination of theory with practice does not mean denying the importance of reading. On the contrary, we must read more carefully, repeatedly, and deeply, striving to truly understand. Otherwise, without mastering the theory, how can we talk about combining theory with practice? In the past learning, especially the learning of leading cadres, some people did not read carefully and seriously enough, claiming to combine theory with practice, but in discussions, they only went from practice to practice, or discussed specific work, not touching on the essence, or talked about everything under the sun, pulling things from all directions, seemingly lively, but actually with little effect, even wasting time. Of course, combining theory with practice also requires a process of going from shallow to deep and repeating. I think that at present, combining theory with practice is mainly about the issue of seriously reading and studying theory. Philosophy has been advocated for many years and many times, and many people have read philosophy books, but why is it still necessary to emphasize reading? I feel that many comrades have not put enough effort into reading or have the wrong methods and have not truly understood. We must put effort into studying the basic principles and basic views of Marxist philosophy, striving to understand, memorize, and master them. According to the current situation, we should focus on grasping the following basic views.

- The view of practice. The view of practice is the first and basic view of Marxist epistemology and is also the theoretical basis of our Party's thought line of seeking truth from facts. The truth criterion debate in 1978 was actually a matter of how to treat the view of practice. Practice is the source of correct ideas, the sole criterion for testing truth, and also the driving force and purpose for developing theory. Mastering and insisting on the view of practice makes one dare to emancipate the mind, insist on seeking truth from facts, and do everything based on reality, thoroughly breaking free from the shackles of dogmatism that emphasizes books and authorities. Emphasizing practice first, of course, does not deny the guiding role of Marxist theory and various scientific theories on practice. Without the guidance of theory proven to be true by practice, our practice will be blind practice. However, the theory guiding our practice must also continue to be tested in practice. When there is a contradiction between books and practice, documents and practice, existing experience and practice, the opinions of authoritative figures and practice, and things generally recognized by the majority and practice, or when there is a contradiction between theory and practice, we can say that we dare to value practice, value the masses, value the grassroots, value reality, in short, dare to use practice to test theory, improve theory, and develop theory.

The importance of learning and mastering the view of practice is that in the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we face many problems, including the current economic problems, which are essentially practical problems. The 10 years of reform and opening up have been correct in direction, achieved great successes, and accumulated experience, but in terms of the entire socialist reform, there are still many realms of necessity that we have not recognized. Some reform practices, with the breeding, emergence, development, struggle, transformation, and ultimate resolution of many contradictions, require a relatively long time, and it is not advisable to draw conclusions too early and lightly in this process. The solutions and methods for resolving various contradictions cannot be expected to come from abroad as a panacea, nor can they be simply followed by our own past experiences that have fallen far behind actual life, but can only rely on the practice of hundreds of millions of people. In the process of practice, there will inevitably be this or that mistake, which is not surprising. Mistakes are often the forerunners of correctness, and correcting mistakes can only be done through practice. If we demand that reform and opening up be smooth sailing, with no mistakes, this is metaphysical a prioriism, because no one has the ability to do this. If we attribute all mistakes in reform and opening up to being unavoidable, this is agnosticism, because a part of the mistakes is mainly caused by subjective factors and can be avoided, and it is irresponsible to the people to use "paying tuition fees" to justify them. The correct attitude is to fully implement the view of practice, not only daring to practice but also daring to use the standard of practice to test whether the theories, views, policies, plans, and schemes of reform and opening up are in line with objective reality. On the basis of reviewing and summarizing, we should promote the correct parts, correct the mistaken parts, and strengthen the insufficient parts. In this way, we can continue to push the cause of reform and opening up forward in a healthy manner.

- The dialectical view. Whether in revolutionary times or in construction periods, one-sidedness, extremism, and absolutism have brought us serious losses. In recent years, in handling the basic problems of economics, politics, culture, and society, one-sidedness is also evident. For example: the four upholds and reform and opening up, "one hand soft and one hand hard"; the necessity of developing various economic components, but the relaxation of management of individual and private economies; the need to reform the highly centralized and overly rigid planned economic system, but the inability to properly open up with planning and activate with control; the reasonable development of township enterprises, which helps to get rid of the backward situation of eight hundred million farmers struggling to make a living, but the serious neglect of grain production and agricultural investment; economic construction has always been our main task, but spiritual civilization construction and ideological and political work have been poorly grasped; the correction of the error of still taking class struggle as the key in the socialist construction period, but the neglect of the existence of class struggle within a certain range, and so on. In correcting these one-sidedness, we should not fall into another one-sidedness. For example, in handling the relationship between the four upholds and reform and opening up, we correct the soft hand and hard hand, but should not make the hard hand soft, but make the soft hand hard, so that the two can be unified and combined better under new conditions. This combination, in essence, is to use Marxist basic principles from the perspective of national conditions to solve the problem of China's modernization. This process of combination is also the process of correctly recognizing and handling the relationship between universality and particularity, which absolutely requires dialectical materialism and does not allow any metaphysics.

Our country is a developing country and must grasp the degree of combining stability, reform, and development. Stability, especially economic stability, is paramount. Stability does not mean stagnant water, nor does it mean no reform and development, but without stability, all reform and development cannot be mentioned. Currently, there are factors of instability in our economic life that cannot be taken lightly. Solving economic problems cannot be discussed purely in economic terms but must also focus on politics and the strength of the masses. The contradictions faced by further rectification and regulation in the economic field are many that have accumulated over the years. These contradictions have developed to the present day, and it is very difficult to achieve results with economic means alone. Comprehensive treatment is necessary. Many solutions, when implemented, often have both beneficial and harmful aspects. We can only adopt a very cautious attitude, treat specific problems specifically, promote the benefits and eliminate the harm, not engage in one-size-fits-all, one-off, and extremism, not engage in metaphysical affirmation or negation. The general requirement is to organically combine rectification and regulation with deepening reform, adopt proactive measures, give people confidence, not to stagnate and rectify, but to look forward, rectify while advancing, and develop while rectifying.

- The view of the masses. Believing in and relying on the masses is the most basic view of historical materialism. In revolutionary times, we must insist on this basic view. Under the conditions of our Party leading the national power, facing the arduous task of socialist modernization construction, we must and especially must insist on this basic view. We must truly recognize that the masses are the decisive force of social change, the subject of practice and cognition, the driving force of historical creation, and the masters of a socialist state. The development of our cause relies on the self-awareness and initiative of the broad masses. Mastering and insisting on the mass view of Marxism is the fundamental principle for us to do all kinds of work well. The basic principles of Marxism-Leninism are to make the masses recognize their own interests and unite to struggle for their own interests. No matter when, the principle of serving the people cannot change, the principle of doing practical things for the people cannot change, and the method of relying on the strength of the people to solve problems cannot change. If this is changed, it is called degeneration and color change.

In the ten years of reform and opening up, the connection between our Party and the masses has both strengthened and weakened. The Party's line and policies are correct, the economy has developed, living standards have improved, and the masses genuinely support us. However, due to the relaxation of Party building, bureaucratism, using power for personal gain, bribery, and other corrupt phenomena have not been timely and effectively corrected, which the masses are not satisfied with. In this year's turmoil, there were so many people taking to the streets, and apart from the issue of class struggle, there is also the issue of the Party's connection with the masses. This is something we should reflect on. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized in his talks before and after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion that we should focus on doing a few things that satisfy and please the people. After the Fourth Plenary Session, the new central leadership is striving to do this according to Comrade Xiaoping's instructions. Fundamentally, to straighten out the emotions of the broad masses, it is most important to seriously correct the mistakes in our own work. If we do this, we will gain the understanding and genuine support of the broad masses, and everyone will voluntarily tighten their belts for a few years and work together with us to overcome the difficulties ahead. Of course, the emotions and actions of the masses are not always naturally reasonable, and when their consciousness has not been raised, we must guide them to the correct direction through patient and meticulous ideological and political work.

The article concludes that the current situation not only puts forward the important task of seriously studying and systematically researching Marxist philosophy but also provides us with an excellent opportunity to combine theory with practice to popularize and propagate Marxist philosophy. This time, the study of philosophy, the central leadership advocates that high and middle-level cadres within the Party should take the lead in studying well, and relevant departments should also make special arrangements for this. We should do a few practical things and strive to create learning conditions from all aspects to promote the development of the activity of studying Marxist philosophy.

1. We should conduct systematic training for cadres at all levels. We should plan comprehensively, arrange overall, and ensure that cadres at all levels can take time every few years to attend party schools or training classes to concentrate on studying philosophy for a period. We should take Marxist theoretical cultivation as a standard for assessing the revolutionary nature of cadres and as a condition for selecting and appointing cadres.

2. We should establish and improve the system of self-study for leading cadres. Those who attend party schools or training classes are after all a minority. For the vast majority of cadres, the main way is to study on their own during work.

3. We should support the activities of cadres and the masses studying philosophy. This is an important part of strengthening ideological and political work and cultivating "four-haves" new people. We should seriously summarize the past experience of the masses studying philosophy, strengthen guidance in a timely manner, avoid the previously appeared tendencies of pursuing form, rising and falling together, and mystification and vulgarization, and strive for solid results.

4. According to the needs of readers at different levels, we should plan to publish a batch of philosophy books. For example, we can select and compile the relevant philosophical works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping, and publish them together, which will be very convenient for the vast number of cadres and masses to study and research Marxist philosophy. We should compile some good and practical philosophy reference books, making them more comprehensive and accurate, convenient for everyone to study and consult.

5. Newspapers, television, radio, and other news media should do a good job of popularizing philosophy. Party newspapers and journals should open columns to introduce philosophical knowledge, publish learning experiences, and exchange learning experiences. Central and local radio stations and television stations can appropriately organize popular lectures, thematic discussions, and knowledge tests on philosophy; they can also produce some thematic films to introduce typical figures and typical cases of studying and applying philosophy with achievements, making the propaganda of popularizing philosophy diverse in form and rich in content.

6. Philosophical workers should make more contributions to popularizing philosophy. Philosophers and all comrades engaged in philosophical theoretical teaching and research should strive to give full play to the fighting spirit of Marxist philosophy, enthusiastically do a good job of guiding the study of philosophy. Philosophical workers should pay attention to the fresh experiences of workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, and advanced figures in various industries studying and applying philosophy, and help them summarize and improve. In this process of popularizing philosophy, philosophical workers themselves will also absorb nutrients, be enriched, and improved.

Li Ruihuan hopes that leading comrades at all levels, especially the main leading comrades, will invest in the study of Marxist philosophy with full enthusiasm and great determination, not only to study well themselves but also to actively create conditions, organize, and lead the study of everyone. He believes that this time, the study of Marxist philosophy will also be carried out and deepened in a solid manner like the Yan'an Rectification Movement and the Truth Criterion Debate, and will play a major role in promoting the completion of new historical tasks in the new era.

    李瑞环在《求是》杂志撰文号召
    努力学习马克思主义哲学
    提高干部队伍的理论水平
    新华社北京12月15日电　中共中央政治局常委李瑞环在《求是》杂志第24期发表《努力学习马克思主义哲学》的文章。文章说，学习马克思主义哲学，对于我们党巩固和坚持十一届三中全会重新确立的实事求是的马克思主义思想路线，更好地领导全国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义，具有特别重大的作用和意义。
    文章共分三个部分：一、提倡大家学点哲学；二、坚持理论联系实际；三、努力创造学习条件。
    李瑞环在文章中说，学习哲学，掌握科学的世界观和方法论，是全面完成当前各项任务的需要。十三届四中全会以后，新的中央领导集体坚决而富有成效地组织了全会决议的实施，整个形势正朝着进一步稳定的方向发展。但是，必须看到，我们面临的任务是艰巨的，困难是很多的，矛盾是复杂的，形势是严峻的。对此要有充分的估计和足够的思想准备。如何把资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想理论重新纠正过来，把经过动乱和反革命暴乱以后的人们思想情绪真正理顺，做到既认真搞好清查清理工作，又团结绝大多数；如何在实际工作中坚持以经济建设为中心，把四项基本原则和改革开放这两个基本点统一于建设有中国特色的社会主义的过程之中；如何切实做几件使人民满意、高兴的事情，把惩治腐败、加强廉政建设落到实处；特别是如何以改革的精神进行经济调整，搞好治理整顿，实行紧缩的方针又不影响改革开放的势头，如此等等。所有这些，既是实际问题，又是理论问题。它的正确解决，都需要借助马克思主义哲学这个伟大的认识工具，坚持实事求是，洗刷唯心精神，克服主观片面，防止和避免出现在纠正一种倾向时掩盖另一种倾向，由一个片面走向另一个片面。
    文章说，冷静地总结过去、思考未来，这是小平同志向全党提出的一个极为重要的课题。建国40年、特别是改革开放十年，我们党历尽艰辛，领导全国人民取得了举世公认的成就，积累了十分宝贵的经验；在这一过程中，也出现过严重的错误和偏差，有深刻的教训。我们应该遵照小平同志的讲话精神，认真地进行总结，不吃糊涂亏，不占糊涂便宜，使其变成党和人民的精神财富。总结历史经验，是一个由感性认识上升到理性认识的过程，是一个实践、认识、再实践、再认识的过程。要真正实事求是地总结人民群众在十年改革开放和现代化建设中的历史活动，做到在估价成绩和失误时，既不因成绩巨大而忌言失误，也不因揭露失误而抹煞成绩；在肯定、保护、扶植具有顽强生命力的新生事物幼芽时，不应忘记去掉附着在它身上的旧事物残片；在果断处理眼前那些两难选择的问题时，做到瞻前顾后，使之对全局产生有利影响，并为今后的发展作一些铺垫。要如此，是离不开马克思主义哲学这个伟大认识工具的。
    理论的重大意义还在于它可以科学地预见未来，使我们的工作和行动沿着正确的方向和目标前进。小平同志关于建设有中国特色的社会主义的理论，党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，我国发展战略的“三部曲”，为我们描绘了光明的前景，规划了宏伟的目标，指明了前进的方向。但是，要把这些大的原则性的东西具体化，使之体现在各个方面、各个时期的工作中，并且达到预期的目的，那就还面对着一个很大的必然王国。要克服盲目性，提高自觉性，探索规律性，增强预见性，也必须用马克思主义哲学来指导。
    小平同志指出，今年我国发生的动乱和暴乱有一个国际大气候的问题。一些西方国家的政治势力，利用社会主义国家在建设和改革中遇到的困难和挫折，鼓吹共产主义运动“已经崩溃”，可以“不战而胜”，并且处心积虑地对社会主义国家推行
  “和平演变”的策略。这种国际大气候，也影响到我们国内和党内。有的公开宣传社会主义的尝试和失败是二十世纪的一大“遗产”，有的公开发表所谓“私有制宣言”。要真正有力地批驳这种谬论，正确地认识社会主义与资本主义之间谁优谁劣、谁胜谁败的问题，坚定我们自己的社会主义、共产主义信念，单凭朴素的阶级情感和个人经验是很不够的，必须借助理论的力量，而迄今为止，只有马克思主义唯一科学地、无可辩驳地揭示了资本主义必然灭亡和共产主义必然胜利的社会发展客观规律。
    赵紫阳同志犯错误的原因是多方面的，从认识论上来说，就是主观脱离客观，也就是脱离国情，脱离实际，违背了实事求是的思想路线。举几个具体的例子：明明出现了明显的通货膨胀，还片面强调什么通货膨胀“难免”，实际上消极对待稳定经济的方针；明明企业思想政治工作已经受到很大削弱，还要搞什么“改造”；明明贪污受贿等腐败现象已经引起了广大群众的愤慨，还在那里片面强调腐败现象不可避免，等等。这些拒绝正确认识现实的错误主张，只能遭到广大干部、群众的抵制和反对。赵紫阳同志主持中央工作以来，消极对待反对资产阶级自由化的方针，严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，其后果是相当严重的。党内和党外搞资产阶级自由化的人，妄图把西方资本主义的政治制度、经济制度和价值观念照搬到中国来，这种脱离我国国情，逆历史潮流而动的荒谬主张，理所当然要碰得头破血流。
    文章说，加强马克思主义哲学修养，是提高整个干部队伍素质的一项战略性措施。无论是学校出身的干部，还是实际工作中锻炼出来的干部，都有一个补课的问题。只有这样，才能抵御资产阶级自由化思潮的侵袭，同时防止和克服教条主义和狭隘经验主义，不断增强工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性，提高领导水平。学好哲学，有助于学习、掌握和发展马克思主义其它科学理论。我们掌握了马克思主义哲学，就有助于理解和掌握马克思主义政治经济学和科学社会主义理论，并且有助于在实践中发展这两门理论。我们提出要建设有中国特色的社会主义，什么是有中国特色的社会主义？就是马克思主义基本原理同中国现代化建设相结合。不认真地学习马克思主义哲学，就谈不上结合，也就谈不上建设有中国特色的社会主义。
    文章强调，历史经验证明，全党哲学水平的提高能够极大地推动党的事业的蓬勃发展。在我们党的历史上，曾有过两次产生了巨大积极影响的学习马克思主义哲学活动。一次发生在建国前的延安整风时期，另一次发生在以1978年真理标准讨论为开端的拨乱反正到全面改革的转变时期。十三届四中全会产生了以江泽民同志为核心的第三代领导集体。今天，我们党面临的形势和任务同十年前相比，有很大的不同。我们有许多有利条件，小平同志等老一辈革命家健在，十一届三中全会以来的路线是正确的，建设具有中国特色的社会主义的道路已经开辟，我们国家的经济实力和各方面的工作经验也都在积累。但是，我们继续前进所要克服的困难之大、矛盾之多、问题之复杂，是绝对不可低估的。特别是今年这场政治风波，暴露了我们党自身存在的许多严重问题，而这些问题的解决也绝非朝夕之功。在即将来临的90年代的十年中，我们的任务是艰巨的，面临的挑战是严峻的。从中央到各地方、各单位，大批的新干部已经和即将走上领导岗位，接过前两代老同志的班。接班，首先的和根本的，是要接马克思主义的班。就是要使马克思主义在中国能够后继有人，并且在社会主义现代化建设的新实践中得到坚持和发展，取得新的胜利。在今天历史发展的重要关头，郑重地提出全党学习马克思主义理论、学习哲学的任务，就显得尤为重要和迫切。
    文章强调，我们学习马克思主义哲学，应重点学好毛泽东同志的哲学著作，学好邓小平同志等老一辈革命家包含着丰富哲学思想的著作。这不仅因为这些著作通俗易懂，它产生的历史背景我们比较熟悉，更重要的它们本身也是马克思主义哲学宝库中的灿烂明珠。特别是毛泽东同志的军事著作，如《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《论持久战》等，为我们提供了在实践中运用和发展马克思主义认识论和辩证法的最光辉的范例，我们更应当加以重视。
    在谈到坚持理论联系实际时，文章说，这次学哲学，能不能开展起来，坚持下去，引向深入，取得扎扎实实的效果，关键的一点在于端正学风。学风问题是一个对待马克思主义理论的态度问题。延安整风时，毛泽东同志曾把学风同党风并列加以整顿，提出学风不正是没有党性或党性不完全的表现，对于推动当时的马克思主义学习，起了极其重大的作用。这次学哲学，我们从一开始就要强调坚持和发扬我们党历来倡导的理论联系实际这个好学风。
    文章强调，马克思主义是认识和改造世界的普遍真理。我们学习马克思主义不是为着好看，也不是因为它有什么神秘，而是因为它是领导我们事业走向胜利的科学。我们重视马克思主义哲学，正是也仅仅是因为它能够指导行动。学了不用，这就歪曲了马克思主义的性质，背离了学习马克思主义的目的，就叫做态度不端正。马克思主义哲学，是一门党性很强的学问，是无产阶级求解放的思想武器。阶级性和实践性是它的两个鲜明特点。只有以强烈的革命事业心和为人民服务的满腔热情，联系实际老老实实地学，才有可能真正把马克思主义哲学学到手。
    文章说，理论联系实际，不仅能够帮助和加深我们对书本知识的理解，而且可以帮助我们正确认识和解决现实问题。所以，要坚持读书，坚持联系实际的学习，使工作的过程同理解、验证、应用理论有机地结合起来，把读书学习的过程同研究解决工作问题有机地结合起来，总之把学习和工作有机地结合起来，真正做到“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”。这样就较好地解决了学习与工作在时间上的矛盾，因而理论联系实际问题，也是一个能否坚持学习的关键问题。
    文章提出，联系经历过的实际，结合历史的经验来学，是学习理论、运用理论的重要方式。建国40年来，我们取得了举世公认的成绩。中国人民创造这段历史，经历了无数困难和挫折，付出了巨大牺牲和代价，应该说这是经验教训十分丰富的40年。对于中高级干部来说，结合这段历史学习哲学原理，不但会有理论的重大意义，而且会有实践的重大意义。40年中尤其值得重视的是两个十年。一个是从1966到1976的“文革”十年，另一个是从1979到1989的改革开放十年。不了解前一个十年，就很难正确理解后一个十年。前一个十年，使我们的党和人民遭受巨大劫难的“文革”，从认识论根源来说，就是唯心主义泛滥，形而上学猖獗。后一个十年，即改革开放的十年，我们的国家、社会、人民以及我们的党都发生了极其广泛而深刻的变化。因此，联系这一段历史来学习，不仅有助于我们加深对哲学原理的理解，而且有助于提高我们执行党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线的自觉性和坚定性。把学哲学同总结经验很好地统一起来，使探讨工作得失的过程成为学习、运用、研究哲学理论的过程，领导干部学哲学就可能出现一个理论学习逐步深入、工作水平不断提高、思想认识日趋自觉的循环往复的可喜局面。
    强调联系实际，绝不意味着否定读书的重要，恰恰相反，更要认真地读，反复地读，深钻苦研，做到真正读懂弄通。否则，没有掌握理论，怎么谈得上理论联系实际？在过去的学习中、特别是领导干部的学习中，有的读书不够刻苦认真，名曰联系实际学习，可是讨论起来只是从实际到实际，或研究具体工作，言不及义，或海阔天空漫谈，东拉西扯，看起来气氛热烈，实际上收效甚微，甚至白白浪费了时间。当然，理论联系实际，也要有一个由浅入深、循环往复的过程。我认为在当前理论联系实际，主要还是学习理论认真读书的问题。提倡学哲学已经多少年、多少次了，许多哲学书人们也读过，为什么还要强调读书呢？我感到，许多同志在读书上下的功夫不够，或方法不对头，没有真正读懂。对于马克思主义哲学的基本原理、基本观点必须下功夫钻研，力求学懂、记熟、弄通。根据当前情况，要着重把握以下几个基本观点。
    ——关于实践的观点。实践是马克思主义认识论的第一的和基本的观点，也是我们党的实事求是思想路线的理论基础。1978年开展的真理标准讨论，实际上就是如何对待实践观点的问题。实践是正确思想产生的源泉，是检验真理的唯一标准，又是发展理论的动力和目的。掌握和坚持实践的观点，说话办事对人就敢于解放思想，坚持实事求是，做到一切从实际出发，彻底冲破唯书、唯上的教条主义束缚。讲实践第一，当然不是否认马克思主义理论和各门科学理论对实践的指导作用。离开这种被实践证明为真理的理论的指导，我们的实践就会是盲目的实践。但是，指导我们实践的理论，又必须继续在实践中接受检验。在书本与实践、文件与实践、已有的经验与实践、权威人物的意见与实践、多数人公认的东西与实践发生矛盾的时候，也可以一并说成在理论与实践不一致的时候，敢于做到重视实践、重视群众、重视基层、重视现实，一句话，即敢于依据实践检验理论、完善理论和发展理论。
    学习和掌握实践的观点之所以特别重要，是因为我们在建设具有中国特色的社会主义过程中面临的许许多多问题，包括当前面临的经济问题，从本质上讲都是个实践问题。10年改革开放，方向是正确的，成绩是巨大的，也有了经验，但就整个社会主义改革来说，尚有许许多多必然王国未被我们认识。有些改革实践，其诸多矛盾的孕育、显露、发展、斗争、转化直至最终解决，需要较长时间，在这个过程完结之前不宜过早轻易地下结论。解决诸种矛盾的方案、办法，既不能指望从国外飞来什么包医百病的灵丹妙药，也不可能简单地沿用我们自己过去那些已经大大落后于实际生活的经验，而只能依靠千百万人民群众的实践。在实践过程中，肯定会有这样那样的失误，这不足为奇。失误常常是正确的先导，纠正失误只有靠实践。如果要求改革开放一帆风顺，什么失误也不出，这是唯心主义的先验论，因为无论什么人也没有这个本事。如果把改革开放中的一切失误都说成是不可避免的，这是不可知论，因为有一部分失误主要是人们的主观因素造成的，是可以避免的，笼统地用“交学费”来辩解，是对人民不负责任的表现。正确的态度是，把实践的观点贯彻到底，不仅勇于实践，而且勇于用实践标准来检验改革开放的理论、观点、方针、政策、方案、计划之是否合乎客观实际。在回顾总结的基础上，发扬正确的部分，纠正失误的部分，加强不足的部分。这样，就能把我们的改革开放事业继续健康地推向前进。
    ——关于辩证的观点。无论是革命年代还是建设时期，片面性、极端化、绝对化曾经给我们带来严重损失。近几年来在处理经济、政治、文化和社会的基本问题上，片面性也是显而易见的。例如：四个坚持与改革开放，“一手软一手硬”；发展多种经济成分是必要的，但放松了对个体经济和私营经济的管理；过去那种高度集中、统得过死的计划体制应该改革，市场调节作用必须充分利用，但未能很好地做到有计划地放开，有控制地搞活；乡镇企业的合理发展，有助于摆脱八亿农民搞饭吃的落后状况，而粮食生产和农业投入却被严重忽视了；经济建设始终是我们的工作重点，但精神文明建设和思想政治工作抓得很不够；纠正了社会主义建设时期仍然“以阶级斗争为纲”的错误，但却忽视了一定范围内仍然存在着阶级斗争，如此等等。我们在纠正这些片面性时，不要陷入另一种片面性。例如，在处理四个坚持与改革开放的关系上，我们纠正一手软、一手硬，不应当使硬的一手变软，而应当使软的一手变硬，使两者在新的条件下统一起来，结合得更好。这种结合，从实质上说就是从国情出发来运用马克思主义基本原理，求得对中国现代化问题的解决。这个结合的过程也就是正确地认识和处理共性个性关系的问题，这里绝对需要的是唯物辩证法，容不得半点形而上学。
    我国是个发展中的国家，必须把稳定、改革、发展三者结合的度把握好。稳定特别是经济的稳定是压倒一切的。稳定当然不是死水一潭，不是不要改革和发展，但是离开了稳定，一切改革和发展都谈不上。当前，我们的经济生活中出现了不可掉以轻心的不稳定因素。解决经济问题，不能就经济论经济，还要着眼于政治，着眼于群众的力量。经济领域进一步治理整顿所面临的矛盾，不少是多年积累形成的。这些矛盾发展到今天，仅仅靠经济手段已很难奏效，必须综合治理。许多解决办法采用起来，往往既有利的一面、又有弊的一面，我们只能以十分慎重的态度，具体问题具体对待，兴其利而去其弊，不搞一刀切、一阵风和走极端，不搞形而上学的肯定或否定。总的要求是，把治理整顿同深化改革有机地结合起来，采取积极进取的办法，给人们以信心，不是停滞下来整顿，而是向前看，在前进中整顿，在整顿中求发展。
    ——关于群众的观点。相信人民群众，依靠人民群众，是历史唯物主义最基本的观点。在革命时期，我们要坚持这个基本观点。在我们党领导全国政权的条件下，面对着社会主义现代化建设的艰巨任务，我们仍然要并且尤其要坚持这个基本观点。我们要真正认识人民群众是社会变革的决定力量，是实践和认识的主体，是创造历史的动力，是社会主义国家的主人。我们事业的发展，无一不有赖于广大群众的自觉和自动。掌握和坚持马克思主义的群众观点，是我们做好各项工作的根本。马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。不管到了什么时候，为人民服务的宗旨不能变，为人民办实事的原则不能变，依靠人民的力量解决问题的方法不能变。如果改变了这一点，就叫变质、变色。
    改革开放十年来，我们党同人民群众之间的联系，有加强的一面，也有削弱的一面。党的路线和政策是正确的，经济发展了，生活改善了，人民群众是真心实意拥护我们的。但是，由于放松了党的自身建设，官僚主义、以权谋私、行贿受贿等腐败现象没有得到及时、有力的纠正，人民群众是不满意的。在今年这场风波中有这么多人上街，这里除了阶级斗争问题以外，还有党同人民群众的联系问题。这是很值得我们反思的。小平同志在平息反革命暴乱前后的几次谈话中，反复强调要聚精会神办几件使人民满意、高兴的事情。四中全会后，新的中央领导集体正在努力按照小平同志的这个意见去做。从根本上理顺广大人民群众的情绪，最重要的是认真纠正我们自己工作中的失误。我们这样做了，就会获得广大人民群众的理解和真心实意的支持，大家就会紧密团结起来，自觉自愿地过几年紧日子，和我们一道闯过面临的难关。当然，群众的情绪和行动并不是任何时候都是天然合理的，在他们觉悟尚未提高的时候，我们要通过耐心细致的思想政治工作，把他们引导到正确的方向上来。
    文章最后说，当前的形势，不仅向我们提出了认真学习和系统研究马克思主义哲学的重要任务，同时也为我们提供了结合实际宣传和普及马克思主义哲学的极好时机。这次学哲学，中央提倡党内的高中级干部要带头学好，为此有关部门还要专门作出部署。我们应该实实在在地做几件事情，努力从多方面创造学习条件，以促进学习马克思主义哲学活动的开展。
    一、要对各级领导干部进行系统的培训。要全面规划，统筹安排，保证各级领导干部每隔若干年能够抽出一定时间上党校，进轮训班，集中学一段哲学。要把马克思主义理论修养做为考核干部革命化的一个标准，做为选拔任用干部的一个条件。
    二、要建立健全领导干部自学的制度。上党校、进轮训班的人毕竟是少数，对于广大干部来说，主要靠在工作中挤时间自学。
    三、要支持干部、群众学哲学的活动。这是加强思想政治工作，培养“四有”新人的一项重要内容。要认真总结过去群众学哲学的经验，及时加强指导，注意避免曾经出现过的追求形式、一哄而起和神秘化、庸俗化等不良倾向，讲求实实在在的效果。
    四、要根据不同层次读者的需求，有计划地出一批哲学书籍。比如，把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、毛泽东和邓小平等革命领袖的有关哲学著作精选一下，汇集出版，这对广大干部、群众学习和研究马克思主义哲学会提供很多方便。要编纂一些好的、实用的哲学工具书，要全一些、准一些，便于大家学习查阅。
    五、报刊、电视、广播等新闻媒介要做好普及哲学的宣传工作。党报党刊都要开辟栏目，介绍哲学知识，发表学习心得，交流学习经验。中央和地方的广播电台和电视台，可以适当组织哲学的通俗讲座、专题讨论、知识测验等；也可以拍摄一些专题片介绍学哲学、用哲学有成绩的典型人物和典型事例，使普及哲学的宣传形式多种多样，内容丰富多彩。
    六、哲学工作者要为普及哲学多做贡献。哲学家和一切从事哲学理论教学与研究的同志，都要努力发挥马克思主义哲学的战斗力，满腔热情地做好学哲学的辅导工作。哲学工作者要重视广大工人、农民、知识分子、干部和各行各业先进人物学哲学、用哲学的新鲜经验，并帮助他们总结、提高。在这个普及哲学的过程中，哲学工作者自身也会汲取营养，得到充实和提高。
    李瑞环在文章中希望各级领导同志特别是主要领导同志，以饱满的热情，极大的毅力，投入马克思主义哲学的学习中来，不仅要自己学好，而且要积极创造条件，组织和领导好大家的学习。他表示相信，这次学习马克思主义哲学，也将像延安整风和真理标准讨论那样扎扎实实地开展起来、深入下去，从而对新时期完成新的历史任务发挥重大的推动作用。
