Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 7th.

Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital recently successfully performed three carotid artery dilatation surgeries, thereby ending the era when this disease could only be treated with medication.

Head and arm type carotid artery stenosis caused by Takayasu arteritis results in insufficient blood supply to the carotid artery, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, and decreased vision in patients. Severe cases may even result in blindness and long-term bedridden status. Medication was the only treatment available in the past, and only a few patients saw their conditions controlled.

In the past few months, the vascular surgery department of Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital has performed surgeries on three patients. The carotid artery was separated from the surrounding tissues and cut open, then repeatedly dilated using a metal probe, and finally sutured. Post-surgery, the patients' symptoms significantly improved. The carotid artery is the blood supply channel to the brain, making the surgery highly difficult and risky. To date, there have been no reports of such surgeries being performed domestically or internationally.

    上海施行颈动脉扩张手术成功
    新华社上海十二月七日电  （记者陆国元）上海中山医院最近成功地施行了三例颈动脉扩张手术，从而结束了这种疾病只能用药物治疗的历史。
    由大动脉炎引起的头臂型颈动脉狭窄，因颈动脉供血不足而导致患者头晕、眼花及视力下降，严重者甚至双目失明和长期卧床不起。药物治疗是以往的唯一手段，只有部分患者的病情能得到控制。
    上海中山医院血管外科在近几个月中，先后将三名患者的颈动脉与周围组织分离后切开，用金属探条反复进行扩张，再进行缝合。手术后，患者症状明显改善。颈动脉是向大脑供血的通道，手术难度高、风险大。迄今为止，国内外尚未见有施行这种手术的报道。
