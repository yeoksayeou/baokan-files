Oil is a treasure and should be cherished

In Zhaozhou County, Chaoyanggou Town, Heilongjiang Province, a new oil extraction plant, the Daqing Oil Field's Tenth Plant, is located. The waste of crude oil here is quite serious. Local villagers use crude oil for cooking and heating. Many households have dug one or two deep pits in front of their houses to store large amounts of crude oil, with some storing a few tons and others storing more than ten tons. Some households even store crude oil together with firewood, which is extremely dangerous in case of a fire! A village cadre said, "In Chaoyanggou Town alone, there are nearly 3,000 households of villagers, as well as some restaurants, shops, and outsiders engaged in sideline businesses, most of whom use crude oil for heating." If each household burns three tons per year, the number is astonishing! It is said that "every winter, the villages near the oil field, and even people from neighboring counties like Zhao Dong and Zhao Yuan, drive cars and carts to the oil field to steal oil. Although the Tenth Oil Plant has taken preventive measures, there are still some loopholes. Some local villagers even steal and dismantle some of the oil field's metal facilities, steel pipes, and steel bars and take them away."

    原油是个宝　应该爱惜好
    黑龙江省肇州县朝阳沟镇，是新建的大庆采油十厂的所在地。这里的原油浪费相当严重。当地村民做饭、取暖，烧的都是原油。一些农户的房前屋后都挖有一两个深坑，存放着大量原油，少的几吨，多者十几吨；有的农户把原油和柴草存放在一起，一旦发生火灾十分危险！一位村干部讲：“仅朝阳沟镇，就有村镇居民近三千户，还有些饭店、商店和搞副业的外来户，多数人家烧的是原油。”按每户一年烧三吨计算，这个数字已大得惊人！据说：“每到冬季，油矿附近的村庄，甚至肇东、肇源等邻近县的人也开着汽车、赶上大车到矿上偷油。采油十厂虽然也采取了防范措施，但仍有一些漏洞。当地少数村民，甚至把油矿的一些金属设施、钢管、钢筋等偷拆下来运走。
