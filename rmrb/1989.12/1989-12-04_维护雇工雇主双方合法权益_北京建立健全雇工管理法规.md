"We are no longer orphans!" Beijing has established and improved regulations for managing employees, legally overseeing labor for employees and employers, and protecting the legal rights of both parties. This has been welcomed by the majority of individual and private enterprise employees.

With the development of individual and private economies, the number of employees in individual and private enterprises in the city has reached over 50,000. Due to inadequate management, issues such as employers arbitrarily extending working hours and deducting wages from employees have arisen. Some even illegally employ child labor. On the other hand, some employees frequently leave without notice, frequently "job-hopping," which affects the interests of employers.

To protect the legal rights of both employers and employees, since this year, the Beijing Municipal Government and relevant departments have successively formulated regulations such as the "Provisional Measures for the Labor Management of Employees in Individual and Private Enterprises," the "Provisional Regulations for the Registration and Management of Employees in Individual and Private Enterprises," and the "Provisional Measures for Personal Accident Insurance for Employees in Individual and Private Enterprises." These regulations have made clear stipulations regarding labor contracts, personal insurance, and other matters.

After these regulations were introduced, over 80% of individual and private enterprises in the city have completed the employee registration procedures as required. The amount of personal accident insurance purchased for employees has reached over 150 million yuan.

    维护雇工雇主双方合法权益
    北京建立健全雇工管理法规
    据新华社北京12月3日电　（通讯员朱伦信、记者夏俊生）“我们不再是没有娘的孩子了！”北京市建立健全有关雇工管理的法规，依法进行雇工劳动管理，维护雇工和雇主双方的合法权益，受到大多数个体和私营企业职工的欢迎。
    随着个体和私营经济的发展，目前全市个体和私营企业雇工已有5万多人。由于管理工作跟不上，出现了雇主随意延长雇工劳动时间、克扣雇工工资等问题，有的还非法雇用童工。另一方面也有些雇工时常不辞而别，来回“跳槽”，影响了雇主的利益。
    为了维护雇佣双方的合法权益，今年以来，北京市政府及有关部门先后制定了《个体工商户、私营企业雇工劳动管理暂行办法》、《个体工商户、私营企业雇工登记管厘暂行规定》和《个体工商户、私营企业受雇职工人身意外伤害保险暂行办法》等法规，对劳动合同、人身保险等作出了明确规定。
    这些法规出台以后，全市80％以上的个体户和私营企业已按规定办理了雇工登记手续，为雇工投保的人身意外伤害保险金额达1.5亿多元。
