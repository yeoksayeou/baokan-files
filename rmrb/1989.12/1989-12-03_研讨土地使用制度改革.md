In recent years, China's arable land has been decreasing year by year, and the contradiction between a large population and limited land has been increasingly severe. Strengthening land management has become urgent. As professionals, we believe that we must not only strengthen the "hardware" but also the "software," which means strengthening theoretical research on land management and use. This will provide a strong theoretical basis and practical reform implementation plans for land management departments.

Currently, we believe that the following topics urgently need to be studied: the theoretical basis for China's land use system reform, the issue of land ownership in China, how to deepen the reform of China's urban state-owned land use system, and the problems and countermeasures of China's current rural non-agricultural construction land use system. Helping the broad masses of cadres and the people understand these issues theoretically, and using legal, administrative, and economic means to strengthen land management and promote the reform of the land use system, will provide a solid ideological foundation.

To promote this research, recently, the State Land Administration and the Shanxi Provincial Land Administration have decided to jointly organize a "China Land Use System Reform Theoretical Seminar" in May of next year. Currently, the Land Economy Research Institute of the State Land Administration is soliciting award-winning essays and is specifically responsible for handling manuscripts. We hope and believe that people from all walks of life will care about this matter, openly express their opinions, and jointly strive to establish a new social trend of cherishing every inch of land.

    研讨土地使用制度改革
    近年来，我国耕地逐年减少，人多地少的矛盾不断加剧。加强土地管理工作已刻不容缓。作为专业人员，我们认为，不光要加强“硬件”，还必须加强“软件”，也就是要加强土地管、用方面的理论研究，以不断向土地管理部门提供强有力的理论武器和切实可行的改革实施方案。
    当前，我们觉得有这样一些专题迫切需要加以研究；我国土地使用制度改革的理论依据，我国土地产权代表问题，如何深化我国城镇国有土地使用制度改革，我国现行农村非农业建设用地使用制度存在的问题和对策等。从理论上帮助广大干部、群众搞清楚这些问题，用法律、行政、经济等手段加强土地管理、推进土地使用制度改革，就有了坚实的思想基础。
    为了切实促进这方面的研究，最近，国家土地管理局、山西省土地管理局等单位决定在明年5月联合组织召开一次“中国土地使用制度改革理论研讨会”。目前，国家土地管理局土地经济研究所正在广征有奖论文，具体负责处理稿件。我们希望也相信社会各界人士都关心这件事，为管好、用好我们珍贵的国土，坦诚发表各自的意见，共同努力树立爱惜每一寸土地的社会新风。
