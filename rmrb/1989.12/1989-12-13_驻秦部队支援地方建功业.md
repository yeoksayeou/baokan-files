Over three thousand soldiers from the army, navy, air force, and armed police stationed in Qinhuangdao braved the cold to participate in voluntary labor for the Qinghe-Ji Canal project. They completed the arduous task of excavating underground water pipes half a month ahead of schedule. Mayor Ding Wenbin of Qinhuangdao recently announced that after the entire project is completed, a monument will be erected for the People's Liberation Army to commemorate the soldiers' achievements for future generations to remember.

The Qinghe-Ji Canal project, which officially began on October 1, will play a crucial role in alleviating the water shortage for both daily life and production in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, a famous tourist destination in northern China. The troops took the initiative to undertake the task of excavating an 11-kilometer underground water pipe and a 395-meter culvert at a depth of 3.5 meters in the urban and suburban areas.
