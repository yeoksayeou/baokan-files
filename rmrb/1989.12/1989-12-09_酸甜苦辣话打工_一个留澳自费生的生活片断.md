She is already over 30 and still unmarried. At the beginning of this year, she came to Australia to study English on her own. When talking about her study abroad life, she sighed the most about her working experience. Below is my record of her conversation:

You want me to talk about my experience with working? There's too much to say. It's truly a mix of sweet and sour, bitter and spicy, hard to describe in a few words. When I first arrived in Canberra, it was the height of summer. Before classes started, I went to restaurants in the city center every day to look for work. For the first 10 days, I was turned away every day. I remember one day it was both hot and humid, I couldn't find a job, I was very anxious, and my mind was in a mess. I went into one restaurant three times, and I didn't even realize it myself. Later, a self-funded student who had been here earlier told me, "Don't be foolish, it's different here from back home. Humble people won't find work. If you say you haven't done this job before, they definitely won't hire you. You have to say you're an old hand, that you can do it perfectly, and they'll be interested in you." I tried what they said, and it really worked. Gradually, I got some odd jobs, like mowing the lawn, babysitting, working as a kitchen helper in a restaurant, and so on.

At first, I was willing to do any job and didn't want to give up any. The Australian government stipulates that the minimum wage is 8.50 dollars per hour, but some employers only pay 4 dollars, and I still took the job. The strongest feeling I had while working here was that I was at the bottom of society. I have worked as a cleaner. The cleaning work in large shopping malls and schools here is all contracted out. They are mostly new immigrants from Europe, with low education and no skills, belonging to the lower class of society. But in front of Chinese students, they act as if they are superior, often scolding with vulgar language. If you retort, they will fire you on the spot. In their eyes, you are nothing, just cheap labor.

I am now working in an Italian restaurant. During peak business hours, there can be over 200 customers in one evening, and even on slow days, there are not less than 70 or 80 people. Each customer uses at least 4 plates, plus cups, saucers, knives, forks, and spoons, that's a lot of things! The restaurant only has me as a kitchen helper, and I have to wash all of it. I have to wash and dry it, and there can't be any water spots. When the turnover is fast, the pile of dirty dishes is higher than I am. There are 5 big chefs in the kitchen, and they all order me around to wash vegetables and cut meat. Every time they stir-fry a dish, they wash the pan once, and they all throw it to me. When it's busy, several people call out to me at the same time, it's very tense. If my movements are a little slow, the temperamental chef will start cursing, and even throw kitchen utensils at me. If it hits you, you don't dare to make a sound. Otherwise, the chef will report you to the boss, and your job will be gone. After the restaurant closes, the waiters and chefs in the front hall change their clothes and leave, but I have to stay behind to clean the stoves and the floor. Often, I start work at 5 PM and don't finish until 2 AM. Working is like fighting a battle. When I get back to the dormitory, I can't fall asleep right away, and by the time I do, it's almost 3:30 AM.

Think about it, the next morning I still have to go to class, and I don't get out of class until 3:30 PM. I have to do homework for one or two hours. Sometimes I go back to the dormitory and sleep for a while so that I have the energy to work at night, and I do my homework after I get off work.

This kind of life is too tiring. To be honest, sometimes when I'm writing in my diary in the dormitory, I cry; sometimes when I'm working in the restaurant, I feel like I can't take it today, and I cry when I turn my back. I'm not a person who can't endure hardship. During the Cultural Revolution, I was a "child who can be educated and saved," and at the age of 14, I started working in a collectively-owned carpet factory. For a girl who was just old enough to go to junior high school, the workload was also quite heavy. But I have never been so tired that I cried! When you are tired, you can rest a bit. Besides, the master craftsmen won't let you work too hard. The relationship between people in the country and abroad is really different, you can't feel it if you don't go out. Every time I'm tired, every time I'm in pain, I think of home, and I think carefully, not just of my parents, but also of the scenes of life in the country before.

I have always wanted to work in the front hall as a waiter, that job is easy, and you can also get tips, but the boss always says my foreign language is not good enough. In fact, the boss is afraid that if I go to the front hall, no one will want to do the kitchen helper's job. That job is not something one person can handle! Now I only work three days a week on the weekends. I still have to study, and I can't work my body to the point of collapse.

As for the future? I don't know. Studying for a bachelor's degree here on my own costs 12,000 Australian dollars a year, and a diploma is a bit cheaper, but it's still 6,000 to 7,000 Australian dollars, plus books, food, and lodging, at least another 4,000, how can I afford it! Without a special skill, relying on physical labor to earn money is not enough to pay for school. I heard that the Australian government will strictly limit the working hours of overseas students next year, not more than 20 hours per week. Sigh, I guess I can only take it one step at a time.

    酸甜苦辣话打工
    ——一个留澳自费生的生活片断
    光明日报记者　薛福康
    她已30出头，还未成家，今年年初来澳大利亚自费学英语。谈起留学生活，她感慨最多的是打工的经历。下面是我记下的她的谈话：
    你要我说说打工的体会？太多了。真是酸甜苦辣，一言难尽。刚到堪培拉，这里正是盛夏。趁着还没开学，我每天到市中心的饭店餐馆找工作。开始10来天，天天都吃“闭门羹”。记得有一天又闷又热，找不着工作，心里很着急，脑子也乱哄哄的，有一家餐厅先后进去了三次，自己还不知道。后来，比我早来的自费生对我说：“你别傻，这儿可跟国内不一样，谦虚的人是找不到工作的。你要说这活你没干过，人家肯定不雇你。你得说自己是老手，干得准保他满意，人家才会对你有兴趣。”我照他们的话一试，还真灵，慢慢就有些零活干了，像割草啦，看孩子啦，当餐厅厨房下手啦，等等。
    开始时，什么活都愿意干，都不舍得放弃。澳洲政府规定，每小时最低工资8元5角，可有的老板只给4元，我也干。在这里打工，感觉最强烈的是自己处于社会最低层了。我干过清洁工。这里的大商场和学校的清洁工作都由包工头承包。他们大都是欧洲来的新移民，文化低，没技术，属于社会的下层。可是他们在中国学生面前却表现得高你一等，动辄以粗言秽语训斥。你如果顶嘴，他当场就把你“炒鱿鱼”。在那些人眼里，你什么也不是，只是廉价劳动力。
    我现在在一家意大利餐厅打工。生意旺的时候，一个晚上有200多顾客，清淡的时候也不下七八十人。一个顾客少说得用4个盘子，加上酒杯、咖啡杯盘、刀叉匙等，那是多少东西？店里就用我一个厨房下手，全得我来洗。洗净擦干，不能有水点痕迹。周转快的时候，脏盘子摞得比我人还高。厨房里5个大师傅，洗菜切肉，全都使唤我。他们每炒一个菜，都要洗一次锅，也全部扔给我。忙的时候，几个人同时吆喝我，紧张极了。我动作稍微慢一点儿，脾气躁的厨师就骂开了，甚至操起手边的厨具扔过来。砸着了你，你也不敢出声。否则，厨师到老板那儿奏你一本，你的饭碗就砸了。餐厅关门后，前厅的招待员和厨师们换换衣服走了，我还得留下来擦洗灶台和地板。经常是下午5点钟上班，半夜两点才能下班。打工像打仗。回到宿舍，一下子睡不着，等睡下，差不多已是三点半了。
    你想想，第二天一早我还要去上学，下午三点半才放学，留的作业要做一二个小时。有时我回宿舍先睡一会儿，以便晚上有精力打工，作业等收工回来再做。
    这种生活太累人了。不瞒你说，我有时候在宿舍写着日记，就流泪了；有时候在餐厅里干着干着，觉得今天可能顶不下来了，背过身去就哭起来了。我不是不能吃苦的人。文化大革命那阵，我是“可教育好子女”，14岁就到一家集体所有制地毯厂上班了。对一个刚够上初中年龄的女孩子来说，那活儿的劳动强度也够大的了。可我从来没有累到哭过呀！你累了，总能歇一歇。再说，人家老师傅也不会让你干得太累的。这人与人的关系，国内国外真是不一样，不出来是体会不到的。每逢累的时候，苦的时候，就会想家，仔细琢磨一下，想的也不光是父母，还有以前在国内的生活情景。
    我一直想到前厅当招待员，那活轻松，还能拿到小费，可是老板总是说我的外语还不行。其实，老板是怕我到了前厅，这厨房下手的活没人愿意来干。那本来就不是一个人能干得下来的活！现在我每星期只在周末打三天工。我还得学习，不能把身体累垮了。
    对将来的打算？我也不知道。在这里自费上大学，本科一年学费12000澳元，专科便宜些，也得六七千澳元，买书、吃住至少还得加4000，怎么上得起！没有一技之长，光凭体力打工是挣不够上学费用的。听说澳洲政府明年要严格限制海外学生打工时间，每周不准超过20小时。唉，我看也只能走一步看一步。
