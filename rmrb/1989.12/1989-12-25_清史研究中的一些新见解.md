The International Qing History Academic Symposium and the Fifth National Qing History Academic Symposium, jointly initiated by the Qing History Research Institute of Renmin University of China, the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Nanjing University, was held in Nanjing in early November. Over a hundred scholars from China, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union participated, focusing on the themes of the Kangxi and Qianlong eras and their southern tours, engaging in in-depth discussions.

1. **Kangxi and Qianlong Southern Tours**: The evaluation of the Kangxi and Qianlong southern tours has always been mixed. The discussions at this conference were lively and diverse, generally forming two contrasting views. One view holds that the southern tours marked the beginning of the Kangxi and Qianlong prosperity, symbolizing the transition of the Qing Dynasty from military conquest to cultural and political governance. The southern tours primarily focused on river management, which was also a form of state governance, and these tours facilitated the prosperity of the Kangxi and Qianlong eras. The opposing view argues that the emperor's tours were a disaster for the common people, similar to the eastern tours, being both labor-intensive and costly, with a flavor of exaggerating a peaceful and prosperous era. The tours were merely for sightseeing and should not be avoided. Additionally, many scholars emphasized that the previous evaluations, which praised Kangxi while criticizing Qianlong, were not objective. Qianlong's southern tours for river management and sea dike construction were beneficial, playing a crucial role in the prosperity of the Kangxi and Qianlong eras. The evaluation of the Kangxi and Qianlong southern tours should be balanced, avoiding the elevation of Kangxi at the expense of Qianlong.

2. **Economic Development During the Prosperous Era**: Many scholars at the conference discussed agriculture and commerce. Regarding agriculture, in addition to the commercial agriculture topic that previous scholars have focused on, the participants used multi-dimensional and multi-level methods to discuss various aspects of agricultural economics. Some scholars, from the perspective of agricultural policy, explained the measures taken by the Qing government to encourage land reclamation, develop border regions, promote multiple cropping, increase the replanting index, introduce and promote high-yield crops, exploit land potential, implement comprehensive management, and improve economic benefits. Some scholars explored this from the perspective of agronomy, believing that the achievements included a significant increase in agricultural books, more detailed and enriched intensive farming and intercropping, and the development of agricultural theories compared to previous dynasties. However, the problem was that the biological foundation theory of agriculture lagged far behind that of contemporary Europe. Some scholars, from the perspective of cultivation technology, discussed agricultural reforms, believing that the development of agricultural production during the Kangxi and Qianlong eras was closely related to the agricultural reforms in the south. Some scholars, from the perspective of meteorology, examined the impact of climate change on the agricultural economy of the Taihu Lake region. Others analyzed the relationship between the remission of grain transportation and agricultural development, and the relationship between agricultural economics and the Qing Dynasty state. Regarding commerce, the focus of the discussion was on merchants and their business methods. Some examined the process and characteristics of Huizhou timber merchants transitioning from local small markets to regional and national large markets. Some examined the development of Shanxi merchants and their historical conditions. Some used newly discovered business books to examine the operational details of Jiangnan sedentary merchants. Some discussed the operational characteristics and hazards of official-merchant collaborations. Some examined the rise and fall of tea trade in the Han-Tibetan border regions. Others explored the issue of commercial taxes, pointing out that the commercial tax during the Qing Dynasty gradually increased, and this increase was mainly due to the expansion of circulation rather than the government's increased exploitation.

3. **Kangxi and Qianlong Society**: Qing Dynasty social history has been a relatively focused and interesting research area in recent years. The Qing Dynasty's lowly people, who have long been overlooked, were discussed at the conference as a social stratum, believing that they were both oppressed and oppressors, exploited and exploiters. The scholar-officials during the Yongzheng and Qianlong eras were very different from those in the early Qing Dynasty. Some believed that the scholar-officials during the Yongzheng and Qianlong eras had lost the fine tradition of caring for the fate of the nation and the people, becoming mere appendages of the emperor without independent personalities or thoughts. The funeral customs of the Manchus changed significantly over time, and some scholars conducted detailed examinations. The rebellion led by Zhu Yigui at the end of the Kangxi era had various explanations, and some scholars, using Manchu and Han documents, proposed a new theory, believing that this rebellion was a typical peasant resistance against extortion and oppression, rather than an anti-Qing and pro-Ming movement led by the Heaven and Earth Society.

4. **Kangxi and Qianlong Governance and Military Achievements**: The discussions on this topic were broad and rich in content. The Kangxi and Qianlong politics was a topic discussed in depth at the conference, particularly focusing on its relationship with the prosperous era. Some believed that the governance of the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong eras created a great opportunity for the vertical exchange and common development of northern and southern cultures. Some believed that the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong eras promoted political governance through clean governance, leading to a strong economy and military, thus creating a prosperous era. Some pointed out that Kangxi's active participation in the imperial lectures had a profound impact on the political development of the Kangxi era, directly leading to the arrival of the Kangxi and Qianlong prosperous era. Some said that the dismissal of Mingju was an important part of Kangxi's comprehensive policy towards Jiangnan, helping to stabilize the political situation in Jiangnan and the entire country, and promoting economic and cultural development. Some, starting from the Yongzheng and Qianlong political situation and governance, believed that Qianlong inherited many of Yongzheng's major policies, made significant changes, corrections, and enrichments in several important areas, entering an important stage of national governance and development. Others believed that Qianlong's policy of combining leniency and severity played an active role in developing the social economy and promoting the Qing Dynasty into a prosperous era. Some also emphasized that Qianlong's severe punishment of corrupt officials played an important role in rectifying official conduct, overcoming corruption, ensuring financial revenue, promoting social stability, and maintaining the prosperous situation. The Southern Study, which has long been regarded as Kangxi's confidential secretariat, was re-evaluated at the conference, believing that it did not play a central role and should not be overestimated. In the discussion of Kangxi and Qianlong's foreign relations, Taiwanese scholars first used the Manchu version of the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which aroused great interest among the participants, and can be used to supplement the deficiencies in the official history of the Qing Dynasty, helping to more comprehensively evaluate the value of the Treaty of Nerchinsk. Zhang Xuecheng's historiography has long been praised by later generations, and at this conference, someone provided a new interpretation, believing that Zhang's historiography was the application of Neo-Confucianism to analyze historical and literary issues, and this historiography was completely the transplantation of Neo-Confucian moral norms into historiography, being the dross in Zhang's historiographical thoughts. Additionally, many scholars discussed topics such as ethnic relations, foreign relations, scholarship, and cultural education during the Kangxi and Qianlong eras.

    清史研究中的一些新见解
    由中国人民大学清史研究所、中国社会科学院历史研究所和南京大学等单位联合发起的国际清史学术讨论会暨全国第五届清史学术讨论会于11月上旬在南京举行。来自中国、美国、日本和苏联等国家的百名清史研究学者，以康乾盛世与康乾南巡为主题，进行了比较深入的讨论。
    一、康乾南巡。有关康乾南巡的评价，历来褒贬不一。这次会上，讨论热烈，仁智互见，大致形成大相径庭的两种看法。一种看法认为，南巡是康乾盛世的开始，标志着清朝由武力征服向文教政治转变；南巡主要是治河，治河也是治国，南巡促进了康乾盛世的形成。相反看法则认为，皇帝的巡幸是百姓的灾难，南巡与东巡一样，都是劳民伤财之事，有渲染太平盛世的味道，南巡就是为了游山玩水，不必回避。此外，不少学者强调，以往对南巡褒康熙而贬乾隆的评价是不客观的，乾隆南巡治河、筑海塘均为有益之举，是促成康乾盛世的重要因素，康乾南巡的评价应予平衡不能抬康熙而抑乾隆。
    二、盛世经济发展。与会学者较多地探讨了农业和商业经济。关于前者，除了商业性农业这一以往论者较多注意的课题外，与会者采用多方位、多层次方法，讨论了农业经济的各个方面。有的学者从农业政策角度，阐述了清政府奖励垦荒，开发边疆，发展多熟种植，提高复种指数，引进和推广高产作物，发挥耕地潜力，展开综合经营，提高经济效益等措施。有的学者从农学角度加以探讨，认为其成就是农书大量增加，精耕细作和复种套种更加充实丰富，农学理论较前代有所发展，存在问题是农业赖以发展的生物学基础理论与同期欧洲相比差距甚大。有的学者从耕作技术角度，探讨了耕作改制，认为康乾时期农业生产的发展同当时南方的耕作改制有密切的关系。有的学者从气象角度，考察了气候变化对太湖流域农业经济的影响。还有学者分析了漕粮蠲免与农业发展、农业经济与清代国家的关系等。关于后者，商人及其经营方式是会上讨论的热点。有的考察了徽州木商由地方小市场发展到区域性市场以及国内大市场的经营活动过程及其特点。有的考察了山西商人的发展及其历史条件。有的利用新发现的商业书，考察了江南坐商的经营内幕。有的论述了官商的经营特点及其危害。有的考察了汉藏边地茶叶贸易的兴衰。还有人探讨了商税问题，指出清代商税额是逐步增长的，这种增长主要是流通量扩大的结果，而不是政府加重剥削的结果。
    三、康乾社会。清代社会史是近年来人们较为关注和较感兴趣的一个研究领域。清代贱民一直少人问津，会上有人将它作为一个等级来探讨，认为贱民既是被压迫者和被剥削者，也有压迫者和剥削者。雍乾时的士风，迥异清初，有人认为雍乾时的士大夫已经丧失了关怀国家与民族命运的优良传统，而沦为没有独立人格和独立思想的皇帝的附庸。满人丧葬习俗，前后变化较大，有人详加考察。爆发于康熙末年的朱一贵起义，其原因诸说不一，会上有人利用满汉文档案，又提新说，认为这次起义是一场典型的反勒索、反压迫的农民反抗斗争，而不是由天地会领导的抗清复明运动。
    四、康乾文治武功。有关这一专题的讨论，涉及面广，内容宏富。康乾政治是会上讨论得较为深入的一个课题，而尤其集中在它与盛世的关系问题上。有人认为，康雍乾三代的经营，造就了南北文化纵向交流、共同发展的大交融契机。有人认为，康雍乾三朝推行廉政，促进了政治上的治世，经济军事上的强世，从而产生了盛世。有人指出，康熙积极投身经筵日讲，对康熙时期的政治发展产生了深刻影响，直接促成了康乾盛世的到来。有人说，罢黜明珠是康熙全面推行江南政策的重要内容和有机组成部分，有利于稳定江南及全国的政治形势，促进经济文化的发展。有人从雍乾政局与治道同异入手，认为乾隆在许多重大政策上继承了雍正的决定，在若干重要方面又作了较大的更张、纠正和充实，从而进入了重要的治国发展阶段。有人则认为，乾隆采取宽严相济的治国政策，对发展社会经济、推动清朝进入盛世起了积极作用。也有人强调，乾隆严惩贪官，对整饬吏治，克服腐败，保证财政收入，促进社会安定，维持盛世局面起了重要作用。南书房一向被人视为康熙的机要秘书班子，会上有人对其作用和地位作出重新评价，认为它并没有起过中枢机构的作用，不能估计过高。在康乾中外关系的讨论中，台湾学者首次利用的满文中俄尼布楚条约文本，引起了大家浓厚的兴趣，可以用它来弥补清代官方史书有关记载的不足，有利于更全面地评价尼布楚条约的价值。章学诚的史德论，一向备受后人称许，这次会上有人作了新的解释，认为章氏的史德就是运用理学观点分析文史问题，这种史德完全是理学的道德规范在史学上的移植，是章氏史学思想中的糟粕。此外，不少学者还就康乾时期的民族关系、中外关系、学术、文化教育等课题展开了讨论。
