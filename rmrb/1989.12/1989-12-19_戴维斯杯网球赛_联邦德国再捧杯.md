The annual Davis Cup tennis tournament concluded today in Stuttgart, West Germany. The West German men's tennis team defeated Sweden in the final with a score of 3-2, successfully defending their title.

Following their victory over Edberg the day before and their crucial doubles win with Järren yesterday, Becker today needed only one hour and 45 minutes to defeat Wilander with a score of 6-2, 6-0, and 6-2. This secured West Germany's second consecutive championship in the Davis Cup, the highest honor in men's team tennis.

Since West Germany was leading 3-1 and had already secured the championship, the final singles match was more of an exhibition and was changed to a best-of-three sets format. In the match, Sweden's Edberg defeated West Germany's Stipp with a score of 6-2 and 6-4.

    戴维斯杯网球赛   联邦德国再捧杯
    据新华社波恩十二月十七日电　（记者胡旭东）一年一度的戴维斯杯网球赛今天在联邦德国的斯图加特降下帷幕。联邦德国男子网球队在决赛中以三比二战胜瑞典队，蝉联冠军。
    继前天击败埃德贝里和昨天与耶伦配对获关键的双打胜利后，贝克尔今天仅用了一小时四十五分钟便以六比二，六比○和六比二轻取维兰德，为联邦德国队第二次荣登代表男子网球团体最高水平的戴维斯杯赛领奖台建了新功。
    由于联邦德国队以三比一领先而稳获冠军，最后一场单打比赛则已属表演性质而临时改为三局二胜制。比赛结果，瑞典的埃德贝里以六比二和六比四战胜了联邦德国的施蒂普。
