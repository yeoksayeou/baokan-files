On October 6, 1989, an 81-year-old film star received an honorary award at the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain and then passed away suddenly on her way back to her country via Paris. She was Bette Davis.

In the American film industry, Bette was indeed a unique actress. She left the world with an image of a person who had a turbulent life, was lonely, but had a strong will, and was extremely talented. Among the many female stars, she forged her own unique artistic path. From her 1931 film "Bad Girl" to her 1986 film "The Whales of August," spanning 55 years, she acted in 86 films. In addition, she also performed in plays and television dramas. In recent years, American television often re-broadcasts some of her past films, making her a household name in the United States. A song titled "Bette Davis' Eyes" has been popular in the United States for decades.

Bette's artistic images are diverse: a nervous spinster, a vain actress, a sloppy maid, an arrogant heiress, an unfaithful wife, a vicious mother, a prostitute, a murderer...

She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress ten times. In 1935 ("Dangerous") and 1938 ("The Old Maid"), she won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice. In 1977, she became the first female actor to receive the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. After her last film, "The Whales of August," the Kennedy Center awarded her the National Medal of Arts. The television drama "Strangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter" earned her the highest award in American television, the Emmy Award.

Bette said that every actor has a role that makes them a star. Her 22nd film, "Of Human Bondage" (1934), featured a sloppy maid, and this role was the one that made her a star for the first time, earning her her first Academy Award nomination.

She used this as a starting point for her talent, beginning to excel in portraying villainous roles. Critics believe that in portraying villainous roles, no actress has surpassed her. Bette herself thinks that the most successful and profound roles are often villainous ones. When portraying these roles, she pays great attention to the rationality of the character's thought development. She said, "I didn't portray the villainous role as completely black. Because there are no completely black people, nor are there completely white people."

She always takes pride in her acting style. She believes that "natural" is not the most important. She never restrains herself. She advocates that acting should be more exaggerated, more rough and powerful than life.

Bette has both practice and theory. She never repeats herself. She believes that a true actor must constantly pursue change. She does not advocate imitating others, and she strongly opposes others imitating her. She has always emphasized the need to highlight the actor's individuality and has lamented the disappearance of individuality on the screen.

She spent her life pursuing realism and authenticity. She said that Hollywood always wants to make us look better. For the needs of the role, she was never afraid to appear ugly on the screen. In "The Anniversary," one of her eyes was covered with an eye patch throughout the film. In "The Star," during the shooting of a scene, she insisted on appearing in front of the camera with disheveled hair and a dirty face, because she believed that a woman who suddenly gets up in the middle of the night and runs out would not have time to fix her hair.

She was not a perfect person. Bette evaluated herself: "I have always been bad at compromising, have a bad temper, am difficult to deal with, stubborn, inexperienced, easily excited, and often make it difficult for others to get along with me." But her stubbornness and obstinacy are also difficult to separate from her artistic achievements.

She attributed her honors and achievements to her own hard work. She believes that to achieve success, one must pay the price of hard work, and there is no shortcut. "The image of me that you see on the screen is the result of 45 years of hard work." Once, Joe Mankiewicz, who won the Academy Award for Best Director, said to Bette: "When you die, people should carve this on your tombstone: 'She worked hard all her life.'" It can be said that this is a correct evaluation of Bette Davis' half-century of acting career! (with picture)

    独具个性的蓓蒂·戴维丝
    曹玉如
      一九八九年十月六日，一位八十一岁高龄的影星在西班牙圣塞瓦斯蒂安电影节上接受了荣誉奖之后，取道巴黎回国，途中突然病故。她就是蓓蒂·戴维丝。
    在美国影坛上，蓓蒂确乎是一位女中怪杰。她给世人留下的是这样一个形象：命运多桀，身世孤独，但性情倔强，才华横溢，在众多女星的交相辉映中，她硬是闯出了一条独特的艺术道路。她从一九三一年的《坏女郎》到一九八六年的《八月的鲸鱼》的五十五年时间里，共拍了八十六部影片。除此之外，她还演过话剧和电视剧。近些年来，美国电视里常常重播她过去的一些影片，使她成为美国家喻户晓的影星。一首《蓓蒂·戴维丝的眼睛》的流行歌曲，在美国竟风行了数十年。
    蓓蒂留下的艺术形象多种多样：有神经紧张的老处女、爱虚荣的女明星、邋遢的侍女、狂妄的女继承人、不忠的妻子、狠毒的母亲、妓女、杀人犯……
    她获得过十次奥斯卡最佳女演员提名。一九三五年（《危险的人》）和一九三八年（《红衫泪痕》）两次夺得奥斯卡影后桂冠。一九七七年成为荣获奥斯卡终身成就奖的第一名女演员。她演出最后一部影片《八月的鲸鱼》后，肯尼迪中心向她颁发表演艺术奖章。电视剧《陌生的人——母亲和女儿的故事》使她获得了美国电视最高奖埃米奖。
    蓓蒂说，每个演员都有使自己成为明星的角色。她的第二十二部影片《人间枷锁》（一九三四年）里的邋遢侍女正是这样的角色。这个角色使她第一次赢得奥斯卡影后提名。
    她以此作为自己才华的爆发点，开始在塑造反面角色上竭尽功力。影评家们认为，在扮演反面角色方面，还没有哪位女演员能超过她。蓓蒂本人则认为写得最成功、最深刻的往往是反面角色。她在扮演这类角色时十分注意表现人物思想发展的合理性。她说：“我没有把反面角色演成全黑的。因为，既不存在全黑的人，也不存在全白的人。”
    她总是为自己的表演特点感到自豪。她认为“自然”并不是最主要的。她从不自我抑制。她主张表演比生活更夸张、更粗犷有力。
    蓓蒂既有实践，也有理论。她从不重复自己。她认为一个真正演员必须不断追求变化。她不主张模仿他人，更反对旁人模仿自己。她一贯强调要突出演员的个性，并曾为个性在银幕上消失而悲哀。
    她一生苦心追求现实主义，追求真实。她说，好莱坞总想把我们打扮得美些。为了角色的需要，她从不害怕自己以丑陋面貌出现在银幕上。在《周年纪念》里，她的一只眼睛从始至终戴着一个眼罩。而在《边境一城》里拍摄一组镜头时，她坚持披头散发，蓬头垢面地出现在摄影机前，因为，她认为女人半夜突然起床往外跑，是顾不上梳妆打扮的。
    她不是完人，蓓蒂这样评价自己：“我一贯不善于妥协，性情暴躁，难以对付，偏执，欠老练，易激动，常常令人难以相处。”但她的倔强、执拗也很难与她的艺术成就分开。
    她把荣誉和成就归功于自己的刻苦努力。她认为，一个人要取得成功一定要付出艰辛的劳动，绝无捷径可走。“你们在银幕上看到的我的形象，是我用四十五年的心血塑造的。”获过奥斯卡最佳导演奖的乔·曼凯维奇一次对蓓蒂说：“当你死后，人们应在你的墓碑上刻上这样一句话：“她刻苦工作了一辈子”。可以说，这是对蓓蒂·戴维丝半个世纪演出生涯的正确评价！（附图片）
