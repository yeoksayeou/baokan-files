The last year of the 1980s saw Japan change its imperial era name to "Heisei" following the death of Emperor Showa. However, the political landscape of Japan in the first year of Heisei was far from tranquil. The cabinet underwent frequent changes, with three different prime ministers, and the upper house elections saw a dramatic reversal. The turmoil in Japan's political arena indicated that domestic political forces were facing a period of significant realignment, and the political situation was entering a phase of major change.

The first major issue plaguing Japan's political scene was the Recruit stock scandal. This scandal, which began during the Nakasone administration and was exposed during the Takeshita administration, had been simmering since the second half of last year. After a two-month hiatus due to the death of Emperor Hirohito and the suspension of party conflicts, the scandal heated up again in March. Officials involved in the scandal were arrested one after another, and members of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) implicated in the case became the focus of public attention. Discontent with political corruption continued to rise. On April 1, the consumption tax was implemented, adding fuel to the fire and causing widespread public dissatisfaction. In the Diet, the LDP and opposition parties were at a stalemate over whether former Prime Minister Nakasone should testify before the Diet regarding the Recruit scandal, delaying the passage of the annual budget. To break the deadlock, Takeshita announced on April 25 that he would resign as prime minister and LDP president.

Takeshita's decision to step down did not ease the internal conflicts within the LDP. The party was deadlocked over who would be the next prime minister. The most popular candidate, Ito Masayoshi, declined the offer. After behind-the-scenes negotiations among the major factions of the LDP, former Prime Minister Nakasone left the party, and Uno Sosuke from Nakasone's faction took the helm. Uno was elected prime minister on June 3, but his tenure was short-lived. He was embroiled in a sex scandal, leading to a series of defeats for the LDP in local elections and a sharp decline in cabinet support rates. On July 24, the results of the upper house elections were announced, revealing a crushing defeat for the LDP, which lost its majority in the upper house for the first time. The LDP faced its "biggest crisis since its founding," and Uno, who had been in office for less than two months, was forced to resign. Subsequently, Kiyoharu Kaifu, backed by the support of the Takeshita, Abe, and Nakasone factions, was elected as Japan's new prime minister on August 9.

In just three months, Japan had three different prime ministers and two cabinet reshuffles, a rare occurrence in the 34-year history of LDP rule. However, for the LDP, the defeat in the upper house elections was a more significant blow than the cabinet changes. Japanese upper house members serve six-year terms, with half of the seats up for election every three years. For the LDP to recover from its disadvantage in the upper house, it would have to wait at least three years. Even if the LDP could maintain a majority in the lower house elections, it would still face a "half-paralyzed" situation in political maneuvering over the next few years.

In light of the lessons learned from the upper house election defeat, Kaifu, upon taking office, made political reform, amending the consumption tax, and addressing agricultural issues the three main priorities of his cabinet. However, to date, political reform has remained at the stage of mere discussion, with no actual progress. The LDP saw amending the consumption tax as a key to winning public support. After numerous internal negotiations and revisions, a proposal was finally presented in early December. The media believed that the consumption tax amendment was not based on economic principles or tax theory but was a product of "political theory" aimed at elections. On the issue of agricultural policy, the LDP had not yet come up with effective measures. Refusing to open the market would invite criticism from the United States, but if the LDP made concessions to the U.S. on agricultural imports, it would lose the votes of agricultural constituencies. Reports indicated that Japan and the U.S. had reached an understanding that the U.S. would not pressure Japan on the issue of opening the rice market before the lower house elections. This showed that the three major issues the LDP was addressing had not made significant progress, and "regaining public trust" remained a mere slogan.

The current focus of Japan's political situation is the upcoming lower house general election. Japanese lower house members serve four-year terms, and the current term will expire next summer. However, the lower house can be dissolved and elections held earlier. The Kaifu cabinet, which has the power to dissolve the Diet, has been carefully choosing the timing to dissolve the lower house and hold elections. In the political schedule for the end of this year and the beginning of next year, the Diet will convene at the end of this year, and Prime Minister Kaifu will visit Europe from January 8 to 19 next year. The Diet will reconvene in late January. It is believed that the period from late January to February next year will be the opportune time to dissolve the lower house and hold elections. To this end, various political parties have begun their preparations for the impending election. The media has started analyzing the election situation and predicting the results. Reports indicate that former Prime Ministers Fukuda, Suzuki, and Tanaka, as well as a group of veteran politicians from the opposition parties, have expressed their intention to retire from politics. Approximately 15% of lower house members have declared that they will not run in the upcoming election. It is clear that this election will be a generational shift in Japanese politics. Recent public opinion polls show that while the support rate for the Kaifu cabinet has slightly improved, a significant reduction in LDP seats is inevitable, and the LDP still faces a severe situation.

Japan's political scene bid farewell to the turbulent final year of the 1980s, and people are watching the upcoming lower house elections at the beginning of next year. Undoubtedly, the election results will have a significant impact on the composition of Japan's political forces, the changes in the political landscape, and the direction of the political situation in the 1990s.

    日本：政坛动荡的一年
    本报记者　于青
    80年代的最后一年，日本因昭和天皇去世改年号为“平成”。然而，平成元年的日本政坛并不那样平静。内阁频频更迭，三易首相，参议院选举出现戏剧性的逆转。日本政坛的动荡，显示国内各政治力量面临重新组合，政局进入重大的变动时期。
    困扰日本政坛的首先是利库路特股票丑闻。这桩发端于中曾根内阁、在竹下内阁期间曝光的案件，从去年下半年起就沸沸扬扬。在今年初因天皇裕仁去世、党派斗争自行休战两月之后，进入3月份，卷入利案的有关官员先后被捕，自民党涉嫌议员成为关注的目标，人们对政治腐败的不满也不断升级。4月1日开始实行消费税，犹如雪上加霜，人们怨声载道。国会上，自民党和在野党围绕前首相中曾根是否就利案出席国会作证问题僵持不下，本年度预算案迟迟不能付诸审议通过。为打开僵局，竹下登在4月25日表示将辞去首相和自民党总裁职务。
    竹下决定辞职的行动，并没有使自民党内幕的争执降温，在谁当下任首相的问题上陷入难产。呼声最高的候选人伊东正义坚辞不受。自民党主要派系首领经过幕后交易，前首相中曾根退出自民党，中曾根派的宇野宗佑出面组阁。宇野6月3日当选首相，孰料出师未捷，宇野又因桃色丑闻闹得满城风雨，地方选举自民党接连败北，内阁支持率直线下降。7月24日，日本参院选举揭晓，自民党惨败，在参院中首次失去多数议席，自民党陷入“结党以来最大危机”，宇野执政不足两个月就难以为继，被迫引咎辞职。此后，河本派的海部俊树依靠竹下、安倍和中曾根三大派系的合力支持，8月9日当选为日本新首相。
    3个月之内，日本三易首相，二度组阁，为自民党执政34年以来所罕见。但对自民党来说，与参院选举败北相比，内阁更迭还属短痛。日本参院议员任期6年，每3年改选半数，自民党若想挽回在参院的劣势至少要等到3年以后。即使自民党在众院选举中能保住过半数议席，也将使自民党在今后数年的政局运筹中处于半身不遂的状况。
    鉴于参院选举失败的教训，海部上台执政后，把推进政治改革、修改消费税和解决农业问题作为内阁的三大课题。但迄今为止，政治改革仍停留在纸上谈兵阶段，没有实际进展。自民党把修改消费税看作是争取民心的重头戏。经过党内再三协调，数易其稿，于12月初拿出了修改方案。新闻界认为，消费税修改案并不依据经济原则和税务理论，而是面向选举的“政治理论”产物。在农业政策问题上，自民党仍没有拿出得力措施，如拒绝开放市场，将招致美国的指责；但如在农产品进口方面对美让步，将失去农业选民的选票。有报道说，日美已达成默契，众院选举之前，美国不在开放大米市场问题上向日方施加压力。这表明，自民党着手解决的三大课题未见显著进展，“取信于民”仍留在口头上。
    目前日本政局的焦点，是即将到来的众院大选。日本众院议员任期4年，明年夏季任满。但众院可以中途解散，提前举行大选。掌握解散国会主导权的海部内阁，近来一直选择解散众院、实施大选的时机。在今年末和明年初的政治日程表上，年末要召开国会，明年1月8日至19日海部首相出访欧洲，1月下旬重开国会。据认为，明年1月下旬到2月份，将是解散众院举行大选的时机。为此，各政党已四下出动，进入临战准备。新闻媒介开始分析选举形势，预测投票结果。据报道，福田、铃木、田中等前首相以及在野党的一批老政治家已表示从政界引退，约15％众议员声明不出马竞选。显而易见，这次大选将是一次日本政界世代交替的选举。近期舆论调查显示，海部内阁支持率虽略有回升，但自民党议席大幅下降在所难免，自民党面临形势依然严峻。
    日本政界送走了80年代动荡不安的最后一年，人们注视着明年初的众院选举。无疑，大选结果将对90年代日本政治力量的组合、政治格局的变化和政局走向，产生举足轻重的影响。
