Wuxi Suburban District in Jiangsu Province is a county-level district with an area of only 150 square kilometers and a population of 110,000 farmers. During the years of reform and opening up, the rural economy here has developed rapidly, and its contributions to the state have been increasing day by day. In 1988, the district's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 2.62 billion yuan, and the gross national product was 910 million yuan, both of which increased by 5.7 times and 4.6 times respectively compared to 1980. More notably, the district has maintained stable fiscal revenue growth for ten consecutive years. Last year, the fiscal revenue reached 135 million yuan, an increase of more than six times compared to 1980, with an annual growth rate of 26.8%, ranking first among suburban districts nationwide. Out of the district's 10 townships, 5 have fiscal revenues exceeding 15 million yuan. In September of this year, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Personnel, and the China Federation of Trade Unions awarded Wuxi Suburban District Finance Bureau the honorary title of "National Advanced Collective in the Financial System."

Increasing Investment, Stabilizing Agriculture

Wuxi Suburban District has only 30,000 mu of vegetable fields, with less than 4 mu per person. With the rapid development of township enterprises, the proportion of agriculture in the district's economy is decreasing, and agricultural output value accounts for only 3% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Despite this, the district finance bureau has always prioritized financial support for agriculture, sparing no effort to increase investment in agriculture. They adhere to the principle of "taking from agriculture and using it for agriculture," raising 2 million yuan annually for agricultural development funds, which are used for the "vegetable basket" project construction, improving agricultural and sideline production efficiency, and promoting stable growth in fiscal revenue.

Last year, Yangming Township raised 700,000 yuan to build a vegetable garden, but due to insufficient funds, the project was stalled. Upon hearing the news, the district finance bureau immediately supported 500,000 yuan. Soon, 300 mu of vegetable greenhouses were erected, and more than 200 sets of agricultural machinery and irrigation equipment were added. In the same year, 11,000 tons of vegetables were marketed. To leverage the district's 14,000 mu of fish ponds, since 1983, the district finance has cumulatively provided 2.8 million yuan in revolving funds to build intensive fish ponds. By 1988, the district produced 10,200 tons of commercial fish, not only enriching the market but also achieving significant economic benefits. Now, the revolving funds have been fully recovered, and by the end of this year, 1 million yuan in agricultural and forestry special product taxes can be collected.

Helping State-Owned Farms Turn Losses into Profits is a notable achievement of Wuxi Suburban District's financial support for agriculture.

In this district, out of 9 state-owned forestry, fruit, and aquaculture farms, 7 were losing money before 1982, and the district finance had to provide subsidies every year. In 1983, the finance bureau sent officials to the loss-making farms to serve as special managers, assisting with economic accounting. For every new project undertaken by the farms, the bureau leaders and special managers participated in the review. For some "short, flat, fast" projects, the finance bureau provided full support. Qingshan Forestry Farm turned around in less than five years, achieving a sales revenue of 10 million yuan and a profit of 1 million yuan last year, and also paying 500,000 yuan in taxes.

Now, all state-owned farms in Wuxi Suburban District are profitable.

Assisting Township Enterprises to Overcome Difficulties

Wuxi Suburban District's township enterprises developed early, with over 1,200 enterprises and fixed assets of 660 million yuan. This large number of township enterprises with a certain scale are the main sources of fiscal revenue. The district finance bureau promotes production to open up revenue sources.

One difficulty faced by township enterprises is insufficient working capital. The district finance bureau strongly supports projects within township enterprises that do not compete with large industries for raw materials or energy and have marketable products. They make the most of limited gap funds and funds raised from various sources to help enterprises improve efficiency and standards. In recent years, the district's township enterprises have developed 120 new products, with the vast majority being rated as national, provincial, and municipal excellent products. In 1988, township enterprises had 57 export-earning products, with a total export supply value of 147 million yuan. Conversely, for substandard products or redundant enterprises, the district finance bureau not only does not provide support but also provides information to dissuade them. Once, a township started an electric cable reprocessing project similar to Guangyi Township's, and upon hearing the news, the finance bureau leaders went to the township the same day to do work, avoiding redundant construction.

At the same time, the district finance bureau has strengthened financial supervision of township enterprises, helping enterprises improve financial management. Training for township enterprise managers and financial personnel has become a system. They use mobile lectures to promote and implement the "Accounting Law" and the State Council's "Provisional Regulations on Penalties for Violations of Financial Regulations." Over 4,000 enterprise leaders and financial personnel have attended the lectures, with 1,990 managers and directors participating in the exams, achieving a pass rate of 99.9%.

Tight Budget, Tight Arrangement

In recent years, while Wuxi Suburban District's fiscal revenue has increased, so have its expenditure items. Facing the severe situation, the district finance bureau has always prioritized the overall situation, correctly handling the relationship between national, collective, and individual interests, striving to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, and striving for fiscal balance. They adhere to the principle of thrift, meticulously planning and strictly arranging expenditures. On one hand, they reduce expenditures of budgeted funds as much as possible. On the other hand, in the case of insufficient budgeted funds, they actively organize and concentrate extra-budgetary funds from various administrative and public institutions. In recent years, the bureau has concentrated over 1 million yuan in extra-budgetary funds annually, all of which are used to supplement the case handling funds of public security, procuratorate, and court organs and to develop education, culture, and health services.

In recent years, the extra-budgetary funds raised by Wuxi Suburban District's finance are not small, but most of them are used for the development of public welfare undertakings, and they are never willing to spend more on themselves. The bureau's office is narrow, crowded, and very simple, with no luxurious, high-end items, and the conditions are even worse than some subsidized counties. The district's leaders and township enterprise managers say: "With such financial managers, we are at ease."

    精心理财　增收节支
    ——记无锡市郊区财政局
    本报记者　王锦鹄
    江苏无锡市郊区，是个仅有150平方公里面积、11万农业人口的县级区。在改革开放之年，这里的农村经济发展迅速，对国家贡献与日俱增。1988年，全区工农业总产值达26.2亿元，国民生产总值9.1亿元，分别比1980年增长5.7倍和4.6倍。更值得一提的是，这个区连续十年财政收入稳定增长。去年财政收入达1.35亿元，比1980年增长6倍多，年递增率为26.8％，居全国城市郊区之首。全区10个乡，有5个乡财政收入达1500万元。今年9月，财政部、人事部、中国财贸工会授予无锡郊区财政局“全国财政系统先进集体”荣誉称号。
    增加投入，稳定农业
    无锡郊区仅有3万亩菜地，人均不到4分；随着乡镇工业的蓬勃发展，农业在全区经济中所占比例越来越小，农业总产值只占工农业总产值的3％。尽管如此，区财政局始终把财政支农作为工作重点，千方百计增加农业投入。他们本着“取之于农、用之于农”的原则，每年筹集农业发展基金200万元，用于“菜篮子”工程建设，提高了农副业生产效益，促进财政收入稳定增长。
    去年，扬名乡自筹70万元要建一个蔬菜园艺场，因资金不足一直举棋不定。区财政局闻讯后，立即支持50万元。很快，300亩地的蔬菜大棚搭起来了，并添置了200多套（件）农机具和喷灌设备，当年上市蔬菜1.1万多吨。为了发挥郊区1.4万亩鱼池的优势，从1983年起，区财政累计提供了280万元周转金，建造精养池塘。到1988年，全区产商品鱼1.02万吨，不但丰富了市场，也收到了明显经济效益。现在周转金已全部收回，到今年底还可征收农林特产税100万元。
    帮助国营农场扭亏增盈，是无锡郊区财政支农的突出成果。
    这个区9个国营林果场、茶果场、水产场中，1982年前有7个亏损，区财政年年给补贴。1983年，财政局派出干部到亏损场圃任专管员，协助搞经济核算。场圃每上新的项目，区局领导和专管员参与论证。对一些“短平快”项目，财政全力支持。青山林果场不到5年就打了翻身仗，去年完成销售额1000万元，实现利润100万元，还上交税金50万元。
    现在，无锡郊区国营场圃已无一亏损。
    为乡镇企业排忧解难
    无锡郊区乡镇工业发展较早，现有1200多家企业，固定资产6.6亿元。这批数量多、又具有一定规模的乡镇企业，是财政收入的主要来源。区财政局通过促进生产，开辟了财源。
    乡镇企业面临的一个困难是流动资金不足。区财政局对乡镇企业中不与大工业争原料、争能源，产品适销对路的项目，大力扶持，尽量利用有限的间隙资金及从各方面筹集到的资金，帮企业上效益、上水平。这几年全区乡镇企业开发新产品120种，其中绝大多数被评为部、省、市优产品。1988年，乡镇企业出口创汇产品达57种，外贸出口供货总额达1.47亿元。相反，对那些劣质产品或重复布点企业，区财政局不仅不予支持，还提供信息加以劝止。一次，一个乡上了一个与广益乡同样的电缆线再加工项目，财政局领导闻讯后，当天赶到该乡做工作，避免了重复建设。
    与此同时，区财政局还加强了对乡镇企业的财务监督，帮助企业搞好财务管理。对乡镇企业厂长、经理和财务人员培训已成为制度。他们以巡回讲课的形式，宣传贯彻《会计法》和国务院《关于违反财政法规处罚的暂行规定》，参加听课的企业负责人和财务人员达4000多人，有1990个厂长、经理参加了考试，合格率达99.9％。
    紧日子　紧安排
    这几年，无锡郊区财政收入增，开支项目也增。面对严峻的形势，区财政局始终以大局为重，正确处理国家、集体和个人利益三者关系，努力增收节支，争取财政收支平衡。他们坚持以节约为原则，精打细算，从紧从严安排开支。一方面，对预算内资金支出做到节减再节减。另一方面，在预算内资金不足的情况下，他们深入各行政事业单位，积极组织集中预算外资金。近几年中，这个局每年集中100多万元预算外资金，将其全部用于补充公检法机关的办案经费和发展文教卫生事业。
    几年来，无锡郊区财政筹集到的预算外资金不算少，但大多用于发展社会公用事业，从不舍得为自己多花钱。区局办公室狭小、拥挤，十分简陋，也看不到豪华、高档用具，条件甚至比不上一些吃补贴的县。区里的领导、乡镇企业的负责人说：“有这样的当家理财人，我们放心。”
