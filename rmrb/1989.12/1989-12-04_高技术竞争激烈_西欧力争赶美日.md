In the past, Western Europe lagged far behind the United States and Japan in the high-tech race due to factors such as dispersed strength and brain drain. In the fierce competition with the U.S. and Japan, some of Western Europe's electronics industries were squeezed out, while others were acquired. Now, only Siemens, Philips, and Thomson remain as the major producers of chips. Western Europe's share of global chip production decreased from 16% in 1978 to 9.7% in 1988. This directly affected the development of various industries, from automobile parts to televisions and even children's toys, all of which rely on semiconductors.

To reverse the declining trend and catch up, Western European countries have taken various measures. A few years ago, Siemens lagged behind the world's advanced level in memory chips by five years. To address this, the company invested $10 billion. This year, when its new generation of memory chip products hit the market, Siemens finally caught up with the world's advanced level. The British pharmaceutical company Glaxo Holdings, which was ranked 45th in the world, developed a new anti-ulcer drug last year. As a result, its annual sales reached $4 billion, making it second only to the American Merck Pharmaceutical Company.

Western European countries have also strengthened scientific and technological cooperation and increased investment in research and development of high technologies. It is estimated that in the next six years, the total investment by Western European countries and the European Community in developing high-tech products will reach $16 billion. Among the larger research projects are:

"The Eurika Plan": With 302 joint research projects and 1,600 participating companies, this plan aims to develop technologies from semiconductors to mobile phones, with a total investment of $10.3 billion.

"The Esprit Plan": Aiming to maintain competitiveness in the fields of electronic computing and information technology, this plan includes 450 projects, with a total investment of $5 billion by 1993.

"The Brite Plan": Aimed at researching and developing aerospace technology and advanced materials, this plan will have a total investment of $722 million by 1992.

"The Race Plan": Aimed at developing a European long-distance high-speed data communication network, this plan will have a total investment of $580 million by June 1992.

"The Comet Plan": Aimed at promoting academic exchanges and strengthening university connections, this plan will have a total investment of $258 million by 1995.

Whether it is the "Eurika Plan" that began in 1985 or other newly developed research plans, Western European countries are attempting to compete with the United States and Japan through these cross-border collaborations. European industrialists say that Europe is investing heavily in research and development to make up for previously neglected areas.

The large-scale investment in scientific research by Western Europe has reversed the previous trend of brain drain. In the 1960s and 1970s, many outstanding scientists and technologists from Western Europe were lured away by the United States with high salaries. Today, however, there is a reverse brain drain. Many researchers are now starting their own businesses, placing greater emphasis on the social benefits of research results. Recently, renowned immunologist Alan Munro from Cambridge University resigned from his university position to work for a biotechnology company. Renowned physicist Ray Dewick from Oxford University also co-founded a company with his school and an American company. People say, "Their mindset has changed. In the past, they would never have started these companies."

    高技术竞争激烈  西欧力争赶美日
    刘绪民
    西欧地区过去由于力量分散、人才外流等原因，在高技术竞赛中远远落后于美国和日本。在与美、日的剧烈竞争中，西欧的电子工业有的被挤垮，有的被兼并，如今生产芯片的厂家只剩下西门子、菲利普和汤姆森三大公司。西欧占世界芯片生产的份额从一九七八年的百分之十六下降到一九八八年的百分之九点七。直接影响了从汽车配件到电视机甚至儿童玩具一系列依赖半导体的工业的发展。
    为扭转颓势，迎头赶上，西欧各国纷纷采取措施。几年前，西门子在存储芯片方面比世界先进水平落后了五年，为此，该公司投入十亿美元，今年，当它的新的一代存储芯片产品投放市场时，西门子终于赶上了世界先进水平。英国格·霍尔丁制药公司原来在世界医药公司中排第四十五位，去年由于该公司研制出一种抗溃疡新药，从而以年销售额四十亿美元跃居世界前列，仅次于美国默克制药公司。
    西欧各国还加强科技合作，在高技术的研究与开发方面增加投资。预计，在今后六年中，西欧各国和共同体在开发高技术产品上总投入将达一百六十亿美元。其中规模较大的研究项目有：“尤里卡”计划：有三百零二个共同研究项目，一千六百家公司参加，发展从半导体到流动电话技术，总投资一百零三亿美元。“机智”计划：旨在保持在电子计算机和信息技术领域的竞争能力，有四百五十个项目，到一九九三年总投资为五十亿美元。旨在研究与发展航天技术和先进材料的“布赖特”计划：到一九九二年总投资为七点二二亿美元。“竞赛”计划：旨在发展欧洲远距离高速度数据通讯网，到一九九二年六月总投资五点八亿美元。为促进学术交流、增强大学校际联系的“彗星”计划：到一九九五年总投资为二点五八亿美元。无论是始于一九八五年的“尤里卡”计划，还是其他新开发的研究计划，西欧国家试图通过这些跨国合作，与美国和日本进行一番较量。西欧工业界人士称，欧洲正在向研究与发展方面投入大量资金，以弥补过去被忽视了的领域。
    西欧在科研领域的大量投资改变了过去人才外流的局面。六十和七十年代，西欧许多优秀科技人才被美国以高薪收买。如今则出现人才倒流现象。今天，不少研究学者纷纷办起实业公司，愈加重视研究成果的社会效益。剑桥大学著名免疫学家阿兰·芒罗最近辞去大学工作，到一家生物技术公司工作，牛津大学著名物理学家雷·德韦克也与学校和美国公司合办起一家公司。人们说，“这些人的心态变了，要是在过去，他们是死活都不肯办这些公司的。”
