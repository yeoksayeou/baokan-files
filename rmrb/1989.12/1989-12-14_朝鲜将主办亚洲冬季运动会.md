North Korea to Host the Asian Winter Games

The eighth session of the Asian Olympic Council, held today in Bali, Indonesia, decided that the third Asian Winter Games will be held in 1995 in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Secretary-General Mehta of the Asian Olympic Council said that both North Korea and Japan had bid to host the third Asian Winter Games. The council unanimously agreed through voting that North Korea would be the host.

The one-day meeting also heard a report from the Chinese delegation on the preparations for the 1990 Beijing Asian Games. The delegates had no objections to the report.

The council also decided to accept Macau as the 39th member of the Asian Olympic Council and to include modern pentathlon as a competition event in the Asian Games.

The council did not make a decision on who would host the 1998 13th Asian Games, but allowed interested parties to submit applications by May 31 of the following year. Mehta said that Indonesia, Chinese Taipei, Pakistan, Syria, and Thailand had expressed interest in hosting the 13th Asian Games. The 12th Asian Games will be held in 1994 in Hiroshima, Japan.
