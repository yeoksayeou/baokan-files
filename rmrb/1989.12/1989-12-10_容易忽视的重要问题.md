    Overlooked Important Issues
    “The crisis caused by the large-scale encroachment on land may not be immediately apparent; by the time it erupts and we try to address it, it will be too late to mend the ship once it has reached the middle of the river.” Comrade Zhang Xiangxi’s words carry weight. Leaders who have the authority to approve projects and construction must indeed think carefully before making decisions.

    The issue of land is both extremely important and easily overlooked. When planting trees, people only think about harvesting the fruit; when setting up markets, they only think about making money. This thinking is too simplistic; it can be said that there is only “first thought” and “second thought,” without considering whether land is being wasted or soil fertility is being destroyed, lacking “third thought.” Why do people forget about “land” when doing things? Our country has a large population and limited land, but in the eyes of some, land seems so worthless. Why does this situation arise? By following this line of thought, perhaps our discussion will deepen further.

    容易忽视的重要问题
    “土地大量被蚕食带来的危机，一时未必看得清楚；待到这种危机爆发再想办法，已是船到江心补漏迟。”曾祥熙同志这句话说得有份量，有权决定上项目、搞基建的领导，拍板时的确需要三思。
    土地问题是个非常重要而又很容易被忽视的问题。种树木只想到摘果，办市场只想到赚钱，想得未免太简单，可以说只有“一思”、“二思”，没有想到土地是否被浪费，地力是否被破坏等等，缺乏“三思”。为什么办事情忘了“土地”呢？我国的人口多，土地少，但在一些人眼里土地却那么不值钱，为什么会出现这种情况呢？沿着这样的思路想一想，或许我们讨论又将深入一步。
