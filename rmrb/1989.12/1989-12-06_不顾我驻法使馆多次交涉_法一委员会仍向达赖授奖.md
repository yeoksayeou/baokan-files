The Chinese Embassy in France has expressed concern over a French committee's decision to award the Dalai Lama a so-called "Memorial Prize." This action, which seriously interferes in China's internal affairs, has been met with repeated diplomatic protests from the Chinese Embassy.

Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the Dalai Lama is a political fugitive who has long been engaged in activities aimed at splitting the country and undermining national unity. It is reported that prior to this, the Chinese Embassy in France had conducted multiple diplomatic exchanges with relevant French authorities. However, some individuals in France insisted on awarding the Dalai Lama the prize, claiming it was to "commend his contributions to the protection of Tibetan culture."

Daniel Mitterrand, the wife of the late French President François Mitterrand, serves as the honorary chairperson of the memorial prize committee.

It is also reported that upon arriving in Paris, the Dalai Lama visited an art exhibition organized by certain groups supported by the French "pro-democracy" movement, commemorating the Tiananmen Square incident. He met with the defector Yan Jiaqi, expressing sympathy for his defection activities. Yan Jiaqi congratulated the Dalai Lama on receiving the award, and the two mutually encouraged each other. The Dalai Lama openly told reporters that he would continue to support "democratic movement" figures in their opposition to the Chinese government.

    不顾我驻法使馆多次交涉  法一委员会仍向达赖授奖
    本报巴黎12月5日电　据此间报道，法国新成立的纪念奖委员会昨天将一项所谓“纪念奖”发给达赖喇嘛，这一严重干涉我国内政的行动，引起我驻法使馆的关注。
    西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，达赖是长期从事分裂祖国、破坏民族团结的政治逃亡分子。据悉，在这之前，我驻法使馆曾通过外交途径向法国有关方面进行不止一次的交涉，但法国一些人仍然坚持给达赖发奖，诡称这是为了“表彰他在保护西藏文化方面鸣做的贡献”。
    达尼埃尔·密特朗夫人担任该纪念奖委员会名誉主席。
    另据报道，达赖到达巴黎后，昨天参观了由法国支持“民阵”的某些团体举办的所谓“不忘记天安门事件艺术展”，并会见逃亡分子严家其，对其叛逃活动表示同情，严家其则祝贺达赖得奖，双方互相打气，沆瀣一气。达赖喇嘛公然对记者宣称，他将继续支持“民运”分子反对中国政府。
