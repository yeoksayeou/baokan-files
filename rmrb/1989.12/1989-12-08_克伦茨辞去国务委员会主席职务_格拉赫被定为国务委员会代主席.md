Grah Appointed Acting Chairman of the State Council

BERLIN, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the East German radio, Egon Krenz today resigned as chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic at a meeting of the State Council held this afternoon.

The meeting, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the German Democratic Republic, decided that Manfred Grah, vice chairman of the State Council, would act as the chairman of the State Council.

Krenz was elected chairman of the State Council at the 10th session of the People's Assembly on October 24 this year. Before resigning as chairman of the State Council today, he had already ceased to hold the position of general secretary of the party following the collective resignation of the Political Bureau and the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on December 3.

According to reports, Krenz stated in his resignation letter that the anti-socialist forces currently present in the GDR are extremely dangerous, and these forces seek to "destroy the pride of our people and sell out the achievements of several generations."

    克伦茨是今年10月24日在人民议院第10次会议上当选国务委员会主席的。在今天辞去国务委员会主席职务之前，由于德国统一社会党中央政治局和中央委员会于12月3日集体辞职，他已不再担任党的总书记。
