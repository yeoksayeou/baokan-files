Biotechnology was established in the early 1970s. It is a new technology developed on the basis of molecular biology and cell biology. People use the new achievements of life sciences to design and reconstruct new species or strains that meet human requirements.

Currently, many countries around the world are strengthening their research in biotechnology. Notably, with the development of related disciplines, biotechnology is playing an increasingly significant role in agriculture and animal husbandry.

Scientists have long discovered that bovine growth hormone can increase milk production in dairy cows, but due to the high extraction cost, it could not be applied in practice. With the development of biotechnology, people have introduced the growth hormone gene into bacteria, enabling bacteria to synthesize large amounts of growth hormone, significantly reducing the cost. Under experimental conditions, treating dairy cows with this product increased the overall milk production during the lactation period by 25%. Similar types of growth hormones and chemical analogs applied to cows, sheep, and pigs have shown remarkable effects in increasing feeding benefits and the ratio of lean meat to fat. In recent years, scientists have also developed new products that allow dairy cows to produce milk even during non-lactating periods and promote cow conception. The use of hybridoma technology and genetic engineering to develop and produce veterinary drugs has become a widely concerned topic.

Biotechnology is applied more extensively in plants. Tissue culture technology has shortened the breeding period, and rapid propagation and virus-free technology have also been applied in some high-value crops. Using cell culture to improve the resistance of varieties saves time and effort. Dr. Maier-Scholz from West Germany successfully bred a high-yielding, cold-resistant new variety of tomatoes that bear fruit above ground and potatoes that bear fruit underground. The Soviet Union also cultivated a tobacco-nicotiana hybrid. Japan successfully fused cabbage and komatsuna to create a new variety called cabbage komatsuna.

Crop variety improvement has reached the molecular level. The Monsanto Company in the United States successfully developed gene recombination technology for soybeans, cultivating soybean varieties resistant to herbicides. People study specific resources, extract their genes, and use them to improve the unsuitable traits of other crops. The Plant Breeding Station in the United Kingdom transferred the salt-tolerant gene from a grass species into wheat, producing a hybrid wheat that can germinate, grow, and produce full grains in an environment with salt concentration equivalent to half the salinity of seawater. Japan has successfully developed a new method for introducing exogenous genes into rice, paving the way for breeding high-yield, high-quality rice varieties resistant to diseases and pests.

Biotechnology has opened up new avenues for the utilization of agricultural by-products. Straw and other materials are used to produce single-cell protein, providing high-quality feed for livestock. The Soviet Union uses biotechnology to improve marshy lands, accelerating soil formation. Japan uses a biotechnology system to extract oil from algae. There are countless such examples. With the advancement of science, the application range of biotechnology in agriculture will continue to expand.

Some scientists believe that after long-term development, a "biological society" may emerge in the future. In this biological society, the technology for developing natural resources will mainly rely on the achievements of biological research.

    生物技术——农牧业的“希望之星”
    吕晓波
    生物技术创立于70年代初，它是在分子生物学和细胞生物学基础上发展起来的一门新兴技术。人们运用生命科学的新成就，定向设计，重新组建符合人类要求的新物种或新品系。
    目前，世界许多国家都在加强对生物技术的研究。值得注意的是，随着相关学科的发展，生物技术正在农牧业中发挥着愈来愈大的作用。
    科学家早已发现牛生长素能增加奶牛的产奶量，但因提取成本高而无法应用于实际。随着生物技术的发展，人们把生长素基因引入细菌体内，使细菌能大量合成生长素，成本明显降低。在试验条件下，用这种产品处理奶牛，使整个哺乳期牛的产奶量增加了25％。相似类型的生长素和化学类似物应用到牛、羊和猪身上，在增加饲养效益和瘦肉与脂肪比例方面都成效显著。近年来科学家还研制出了新产品，使奶牛在非哺乳期也能产奶并能促进奶牛授孕。利用杂交瘤技术和遗传工程研制生产兽用药已成为人们普遍关注的课题。
    生物技术在植物上应用得更为广泛。花培技术缩短了育种年限，快繁和脱毒技术也已在一些经济价值较高的作物中应用。利用细胞培养来改良品种的抗性既省时又省力。西德麦尔肖博士成功地育成地上结番茄、地下结马铃薯的高产耐寒新品种。苏联还培育出烟草颠茄杂种。日本成功地把卷心菜和小松菜融合成卷心小松菜。
    作物品种的改良工作已达到了分子水平。美国孟山都公司成功地研制出大豆的基因重组技术，培育出耐除草剂的大豆品种。人们对特异性的资源进行研究，把其基因提取出来，用以改良其它作物的不适性状。英国植物育种站将小草的耐盐基因转移到小麦中，产生的杂种小麦可以在盐浓度相当于海水盐浓度一半的环境中发芽、生长和产生饱满的麦粒。日本研究成功外源基因导入水稻的新方法，为今后培育耐病虫害，高产优质水稻品种开辟了一条新途径。
    生物技术为农副产品开辟了新的利用途径。秸秆等被用来生产单细胞蛋白，可为畜牧业提供优质的饲料。苏联用生物技术法改良沼泽地，加速土壤的形成。日本利用生物工程系统从绿藻中提取石油。这类实例不胜枚举。随着科学的进步，生物技术在农业中的应用范围将日益扩大。
    一些科学家认为，经过长期的发展，未来可能会出现“生物社会”。在生物社会中，开发自然资源的技术将主要依靠生物学研究的成果。
