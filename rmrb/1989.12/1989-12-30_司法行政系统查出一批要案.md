Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th.

The judicial administrative system at various levels across the country has been diligently implementing the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to strengthen anti-corruption efforts and resolutely combat corruption. A number of serious cases of lawlessness and disciplinary violations have been uncovered.

By the end of November this year, the judicial administrative system nationwide had investigated and handled 94 cases involving amounts of 10,000 yuan or more, involving 112 individuals. Among them, one was a bureau-level cadre and 12 were division-level cadres. Additionally, 37 cases involving division-level and above cadres with amounts less than 10,000 yuan were also handled as important cases.

A responsible official from the Ministry of Justice pointed out that from the cases of lawlessness and disciplinary violations that have been uncovered, it is clear that there are indeed a few law enforcement officers in the judicial administrative system who have no regard for laws, party discipline, and administrative regulations, who cannot resist the temptation of money, who break the law while enforcing it, and who accept bribes and pervert justice. To ensure the integrity of the judicial administrative team, it is necessary to persistently and unremittingly carry out anti-corruption efforts and the fight against corruption.

    司法行政系统查出一批要案
    据新华社北京12月29日电　记者从司法部获悉：全国各级司法行政系统认真贯彻落实党中央、国务院关于狠抓廉政建设、坚决惩治腐败的决定，查出一批严重违法乱纪案件。
    截至今年11月底，全国司法行政系统共查处万元以上的经济案件94件，112人。其中厅级干部1人，处级干部12人。同时，对涉及37名处级以上干部，金额不足万元的经济案件也作为重要案件进行了查处。
    司法部负责同志指出，从已查出的违法乱纪案件看，司法行政系统确有极少数干警目无法纪、党纪、政纪，经不起金钱的诱惑，执法犯法，贪赃枉法。为了确保司法行政队伍的廉洁，要把廉政建设和反腐败斗争长期不懈地坚持下去。
