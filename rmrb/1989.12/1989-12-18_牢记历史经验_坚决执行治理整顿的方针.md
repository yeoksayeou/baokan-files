The decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on further rectification and deepening of reform fully affirms the achievements of the ten-year reform and opening-up and the one-year rectification, realistically assesses the current economic problems and difficulties, and continues to resolutely implement the policy of rectification and deepening of reform. The session emphasized that at any time, we must start from China's basic national conditions, firmly establish the guiding ideology of long-term, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy, and resolutely prevent the erroneous tendency of seeking quick success and pursuing overly high rates of economic growth. This is the most important lesson drawn from China's 40 years of economic construction.

Historical Experience from the Early Years of the Founding of the Nation and the Early 1960s

The economic difficulties we currently face are mainly manifested in the fact that inflation has not been curbed and the economic structure is very irrational. Stopping inflation and stabilizing prices is a major task of this round of economic rectification. China has rich experience in curbing inflation. In March 1950, we successfully ended a 12-year period of severe inflation, which not only impressed the representatives of the Chinese bourgeoisie but also amazed foreign economists. In the early 1960s, due to the mistakes of the "Great Leap Forward," prices rose again, but we overcame this problem through three years of adjustment. The difficulty of overcoming these two instances of inflation was considerable, but due to the determination of the leadership and the unified efforts of the people, we soon overcame the difficulties and returned to a smooth path. It is necessary to review historical experience to get out of the current predicament.

From 1949 to 1950, the fundamental cause of the first instance of inflation was the large-scale Liberation War, with enormous military expenditures. Therefore, curbing inflation and stabilizing prices could only be achieved when the Liberation War was victorious nationwide and fiscal revenue and expenditure were basically balanced. By early 1950, the Liberation War was basically over, and in March, the central government unified national fiscal revenue and expenditure, achieving basic balance. This allowed the central government to control the currency issuance, thus stabilizing prices.

At that time, achieving fiscal balance was not easy. After 12 years of war, the national economy was in ruins, and people's lives were very difficult. To ensure social stability, we had to absorb a large number of former Nationalist military personnel and government employees, in addition to our own cadres and soldiers, totaling 9 million people who needed to be supported by the government. Premier Zhou Enlai once pointed out that this was the "burden of victory" that needed to be solved first. Comrade Chen Yun formulated the financial and economic policy based on this, emphasizing that to stabilize prices, fiscal balance must be ensured first. Therefore, our economic policy not only could not start investment construction but also could only focus on key areas for economic recovery. It was not until 1951, especially 1952, that we proposed comprehensive recovery and began some small-scale construction projects that were urgently needed by society. Due to the clear-headed leadership, we did not seek quick success, and production developed rapidly in these three years. Fiscal revenue and expenditure were not only balanced but also had a slight surplus. Although the people's living standards were still very low, they were much better than before, and they were full of hope for the future, believing that things would get better and better. Therefore, the people were full of confidence and praised the government, quickly overcoming the difficulties.

In 1953, we began the First Five-Year Plan, aiming to lay the initial foundation for industrialization. Due to limited strength, we could only focus on 156 key construction projects assisted by the Soviet Union, plus our own small-scale construction projects totaling 700 items. Due to the rapid development of production during the three years of recovery, the tendency to seek quick success began to emerge, and by 1956, there was a relatively large instance of rash advancement. However, due to the clear-headed leadership (especially Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yun, who were in charge of economic work), as soon as there was rash advancement, they came out to stop it, so fiscal revenue and expenditure were basically balanced, currency issuance was not excessive, and prices were basically stable.

At the time of the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the great victories in socialist construction and socialist transformation, some leaders became hot-headed and, starting in 1958, made the serious mistake of the "Great Leap Forward." Heavy industry experienced three consecutive years of excessively high-speed growth. The tendency to seek quick success in production, coupled with the tendency to seek quick transitions in socialist transformation, led to a significant decline in agricultural production in 1959, followed by a significant decline in light industrial production in 1960, and a significant decline in heavy industrial production in 1961 and 1962. From 1958 to 1960, there was a fiscal deficit of 1.7 billion yuan, and currency issuance increased by 1.4 times from the end of 1957 to the end of 1961. Inflation, coupled with the decline in production, made it even more difficult to stabilize prices. In this situation, to overcome the difficulties, the main measures taken at the time were to drastically reduce basic construction investment, from 3.84 billion yuan in 1960 to 1.23 billion yuan in 1961 and 676 million yuan in 1962, thus eliminating the fiscal deficit and achieving a surplus of 830 million yuan in 1962. Currency issuance was reduced from 12.5 billion yuan at the end of 1961 to 8 billion yuan in 1964, and prices quickly fell. If the price index in 1957 is taken as 100, it rose to 126 in 1962 and fell to 111 in 1965. In these few years, from the central leadership to the people of the entire country, everyone gritted their teeth and relied on effective adjustment measures to basically overcome the difficulties in three years. Due to the unity of the people, there was relatively little complaint. In the following three years, industrial and agricultural production quickly recovered, and the living standards of the people of the entire country improved, making them feel relatively cheerful.

The "Cultural Revolution" began in 1966. Production experienced many twists and turns, but the guiding ideology of emphasizing preparedness for war and seeking quick success still dominated, and the scale of basic construction was still too large in most years, with heavy industry developing too quickly, once again disrupting the balance between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. In these ten years, fiscal revenue and expenditure were basically balanced, and prices were basically stable, but this was largely achieved at the expense of improving the people's living standards. In 1976, the living standards of the people were lower than in 1965 before the "Cultural Revolution" and also lower than in 1957 before the "Great Leap Forward." The people were naturally not satisfied with this.

These 20 years of experience prove that when we face serious difficulties, we can start from reality, seek truth from facts, respect objective laws, and adhere to correct policies, resulting in the rapid overcoming of difficulties and the national economy returning to a stable and coordinated development track. However, when we achieve great successes and the national economy develops smoothly, we often easily become intoxicated with victory, allowing the tendency to seek quick success to grow, resulting in significant setbacks in the development of the national economy. Historical experience tells us that we must pay attention to preventing the tendency to seek quick success from growing when we are victorious. The scale of construction investment must be adapted to the improvement of material supply capacity, and the improvement of people's living standards must be adapted to the development of consumer goods production. We must insist on the comprehensive balance of finance, credit, and materials and maintain the coordination of the basic proportion of the national economy. Once the proportion is out of balance, economic development will experience significant fluctuations, bringing serious difficulties.

After the "Gang of Four" was smashed, we spent two years rectifying chaos and establishing a new leadership core with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the helm. In these two years, we mainly focused on overcoming the serious chaos in the national economy caused by the "Cultural Revolution" and adjusting the irrational proportion between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. In 1978, under the influence of the tendency to seek quick success, another "foreign leap" emerged, exacerbating the imbalance in the economic proportion, and the urgency of economic adjustment became increasingly apparent. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee proposed that while carrying out reform and opening up, we must use greater efforts to adjust the proportion of the national economy. The 1979 national economic plan focused on reducing the scale of basic construction to save money to increase the purchase prices of agricultural products and the wages of workers, thereby improving the living standards of the people. In the relationship between adjustment and reform, the first few years should focus on adjustment and then reform. This is not only because only by adjusting the economic order can the necessary conditions for reform be created, but also because our reform does not yet have a complete blueprint and needs to continuously create experience and explore forward. Practice has proven that this decision is completely correct.

Our adjustment work has experienced many twists and turns. In 1979 and 1980, due to the lack of understanding of the necessity of economic adjustment among many comrades, there was significant resistance, and the task of reducing basic construction was not fully completed, while the growth of consumption funds exceeded the original plan, resulting in a considerable fiscal deficit, slightly more currency issuance, and a relatively large increase in prices (mainly due to the increase in the selling prices of eight categories of food, and the state provided price subsidies). To reduce the scale of basic construction, in early 1981, the bank applied the brakes, freezing the deposits of local governments and enterprises, causing industrial production to experience negative growth in the first quarter (mainly in the machinery manufacturing industry, while light industry still increased); starting from the second quarter, the bank gradually loosened the monetary policy, and this year's total industrial and agricultural output value only increased by 4.6%, of which agriculture increased by 6.4%, light industry increased by 14.3%, and heavy industry decreased by 4.6%. This year, fixed asset investment was reduced by 780 million yuan compared to the previous year, which was the best year to complete the adjustment plan, and the fiscal deficit and currency issuance were significantly reduced, and prices were basically stable. In the following 1982 and 1983, fixed asset investment was still strictly controlled, so the supply of production materials gradually eased, and the supply of consumer goods increased, with some commodities (including cotton cloth) even experiencing a "buyer's market."

In these few years, agricultural production rapidly increased due to the increase in the purchase prices of agricultural products and the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, which in turn promoted the rapid development of light industry. The growth rate of heavy industry was relatively slow, but except for 1981, it still had an appropriate growth rate. The proportion between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry was relatively coordinated, and from 1981 to 1983, the accumulation rate dropped to below 30%. The living standards of the people significantly improved, and the adjustment tasks were basically completed.

In October 1984, the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee shifted the focus of economic work to reform and opening up and pointed out that China's socialist economy is a planned commodity economy based on the public ownership of the means of production. It also said, "The more we activate the economy, the more we need to emphasize macro-control, and the more we need to skillfully use price, tax, credit, and other economic levers on the basis of timely grasping the economic dynamics to regulate the total supply and demand of society, the proportion of accumulation and consumption, etc." Undoubtedly, the direction indicated by the plenary session is completely correct, but errors occurred in the implementation.

To implement the new economic management system, we must, on the premise of maintaining fiscal balance and controlling the amount of currency issuance to avoid inflation, gradually rationalize prices and, on this basis, skillfully use tax, credit, and other economic levers for macro-control. Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter of 1984, relevant departments made two wrong decisions: using the total amount of credit in the previous year as the base for the 1985 credit fund and using the total amount of wages in the previous year as the base for the 1985 wage fund. As a result, banks competed to issue loans, expanding the scale of basic construction. Enterprises also competed to raise wages and issue bonuses. The result was that currency issuance was out of control. The amount of currency issued in the fourth quarter of this year increased by 146% compared to the same period last year, and the total for the year increased by 49.5% compared to last year, resulting in obvious inflation.

In the first half of 1985, due to inflation, industrial production experienced excessively high-speed growth. In response to this abnormal phenomenon, the State Council held four governors' meetings, requiring the reduction of fixed asset investment, but at that time, the entire country was intoxicated with the excessively high-speed growth of the economy, and the measures taken were not effective. Banks continued to use most of the credit funds for fixed asset investment loans, and many enterprises lacked working capital after starting production. The shortages of energy and raw materials were further exposed. In the first quarter of 1986, the growth rate of industrial production fell to 4.4%, and many people cried out "slump," demanding the loosening of monetary policy. In the preface to the 1986 "China Economic Yearbook," I pointed out: This year's 4.4% in the first quarter is compared to the 23% excessively high-speed growth in the first quarter of last year. The average annual growth rate for the two years exceeds 13%. Last year's growth rate gradually decreased quarter by quarter, and this year it may gradually increase, and the total for the year may still reach 8%, combined with last year's 18%, the average annual growth rate is 13%, which is still a high speed. The result of implementation was that the growth rate of industrial production in 1986 reached 8.8%.

In the second quarter of this year, the decision-making of the highest leadership of the State Council began to waver, attempting to continue using inflation to maintain the excessively high-speed growth of industrial production, resulting in increasingly serious macro-control. In 1987 and 1988, due to the continued development of inflation, the price increase rate remained high. The highest decision-makers attempted to abandon the correct proposition of the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee that "rationalizing the irrational price system is the key to the success or failure of the entire economic system reform" and wanted to bypass price reform to accelerate economic system reform. After this illusion was shattered, they attempted to bypass suppressing inflation to accelerate price reform. After the news of accelerating the pace of price reform was revealed in the newspapers in August 1988, various places experienced market chaos such as withdrawing deposits from banks and rushing to buy various commodities. The Party Central Committee promptly convened the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, proposing the wise decision of "rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening reform," quickly calming down the situation.

The overall direction of the ten-year reform is correct, and the achievements are enormous, which should not be denied. In the first five years, the focus of reform was on the countryside, gradually extending to the cities, and the household contract responsibility system was gradually promoted in the countryside, with significant effects, and is now being further improved. Under the condition of not affecting grain production, the development of diversified operations, the establishment of township enterprises, and the promotion of urban-rural commodity exchanges not only greatly improved the living standards of farmers but also enriched the supply of cities. In cities, we gradually changed the problem of overly centralized economic management, expanded the autonomy of local governments and enterprises, enabling them to develop themselves and produce market-oriented products. We changed the monopoly of urban and rural commerce, advocated the operation of state-owned, collective, and individual channels, and the market became increasingly prosperous, with a significant increase in employment. We also proposed that China is still in the primary stage of socialism and must, under the condition of adhering to the public ownership system as the mainstay, appropriately develop individual and private economies as a supplement to state-owned and collective economies. To accelerate socialist modernization construction, we must also open up to the outside world, vigorously develop three types of enterprises, build economic development zones and open-up areas, and open-up cities, all of which have been very effective.

The overall direction of the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee is correct, but in practice, there were mistakes in seeking quick success. At a time when the new system of using price, tax, credit, and other economic levers for macro-control has not been established, the necessary management power of the central government in planning, finance, banking, foreign trade, and other aspects was excessively weakened, shifting from overly centralized to overly decentralized, destroying the macro-economic environment. Furthermore, under the condition that the new economic system has not yet been preliminarily formed, we rushed to increase the growth rate, resulting in economic overheating and new imbalances. This imbalance is different from the imbalances after the "Great Leap Forward" and before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. The previous two instances were overly emphasizing heavy industry, with agriculture and light industry lagging behind, resulting in the development of production while the living standards of the people declined; the later stage of the "Great Leap Forward" also experienced a significant decline in agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry in sequence. At that time, we started the adjustment work under the condition of a significant decline in industrial and agricultural production. This time, the imbalance occurred on the basis of excessively high-speed development of production, with processing industry and high-consumption service industry developing too quickly, and energy, raw materials, and railway transportation could not keep up, with investment and consumption demand expanding simultaneously, and prices rising significantly. We started the adjustment work under the condition of high-speed development of industrial production. In this situation, people often do not see economic overheating but only see the increasing price increase rate, not understanding that the price increase is caused by economic overheating. Therefore, this time, the difficulty of rectification and adjustment is greater, and it is necessary for everyone to better understand historical experience and understand the importance of adhering to the long-term, stable, and coordinated development of the economy.

"Rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order" have been carried out for more than a year, and initial results have been achieved, but there is still a considerable distance to go to get out of the predicament. The recently convened Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee estimates that it may take three years or even a little longer. In the past few months, the situation seems to continue to deteriorate on the surface, but in fact, it is developing in a healthy direction. In September, October, and November of this year, the growth rate of industrial production compared to the same period last year fell to 0.9%, -2.1%, and 0.9%, respectively, so some people cried out "slump" again, demanding the loosening of monetary policy to promote the rebound of the growth rate. In fact, the current speed is compared to the same period last year when the panic buying situation occurred. In September, October, and November of last year, industrial production experienced excessively high-speed growth due to panic buying, reaching 20.2%, 20.4%, and 17.7%, respectively. When observing the development speed of industrial production, this situation should be estimated. The growth rate of industrial production from January to November this year compared to the same period last year is 7%, and the total for the year is definitely less than 7%. The growth rate of the gross national product may be around 5%, which is not low compared to foreign countries.

In the first quarter of this year, industrial production still maintained a relatively high growth rate (the growth rate of state-owned industry decreased), but due to the shortage of energy and the sharp increase in the prices of raw materials, profits decreased and losses increased, and production efficiency continued to decline. The solution can only be to accelerate the increase in the production of energy and raw materials (which will take a considerable amount of time) and the decline of the processing industry. This year's low speed is a necessary result of the excessively high speed of the previous few years.

Another problem is the decline in product quality. Due to the implementation of the fiscal contract responsibility system, the regional division of labor in production was disrupted. Cotton-producing areas competed to establish small cotton textile mills, wool-producing areas competed to establish small wool textile mills, and tobacco-producing areas competed to establish small tobacco factories. They used high-grade raw materials to produce low-grade products due to their backward technology. Wuxi is a region with developed textile industry, and most of its products are exported to earn foreign exchange. However, the cotton is produced in the northern part of Jiangsu, and it was used up by the small cotton textile mills in northern Jiangsu. State-owned mills can produce 60-100 count fine yarn to weave high-grade fabrics; township mills spin 32 count or even 24 count coarse yarn, which can only weave low-grade fabrics or cotton blankets, with a value difference of several times. This is also an important reason for the decline in industrial output value this year.

More obvious than the decline in the growth rate of industry is the decline in the retail sales of market commodities, from the tight market of the same period last year to the sluggish market this year. For producers, this is a greater difficulty than the decline in production growth. However, from the perspective of macro-control, this will provide a premise for us to adjust the industrial structure and improve economic efficiency. Last year, during the panic buying, many low-quality products that had been accumulated for many years were also bought up, so it was possible to produce blindly without considering product quality and market suitability. Now it is not possible. In this situation, if a competitive market is established, it will be necessary to compete in quality, cost, and market suitability, with the survival of the fittest. Things that could not be done in the past now have the possibility of being done.

Market sluggishness is a disaster in Western countries, but in China, which is experiencing economic overheating, it may be an opportunity. We should seize the opportunity to vigorously adjust the industrial structure and product structure, which is the key to further rectification and adjustment. Only by seizing this key can the entire national economy be brought into a virtuous cycle. We must work hard to significantly increase agricultural production and promote the stable growth of energy and important raw material production. At the same time, we must vigorously adjust the processing industry to make the processing industry coordinated with the development of agriculture and basic industry and adapted to the changes in market demand. Adjust the product structure according to market demand and increase effective supply. In terms of funds, energy, and raw material supply, it is necessary to implement a policy of tilting support to help advantageous enterprises overcome difficulties. For township enterprises, the policy of adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement should be implemented to promote their healthy development.

Of course, adjusting the industrial structure will require a heavy price, first of all, many factories that have long relied on eating from the state's big pot for survival may go bankrupt. In the past few years, many speculative companies that emerged during the economic overheating have been decided by the state to be cleaned up. This is a skin tumor, and it is not possible to not decisively remove it. Many factories with high energy consumption and the use of high-grade raw materials to produce low-grade products can be allowed to be eliminated in the competition or to be linked with large factories for transformation.

The above will inevitably lead to a considerable number of workers becoming unemployed, which is a problem that cannot be ignored, but it is not without a solution. China is a country with the largest population, and except for a few coastal areas, there has never been full employment. Before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, there were a large number of unemployed youth in cities and many people in rural areas in a hidden state of semi-unemployment. This difficulty was overcome through ten years of reform. Now is the time of the most full employment, and the emergence of the unemployment problem, as long as the whole country shares the same hardships and gritted their teeth to endure a few years of hardship, and do a good job of overall planning, the difficulties can be quickly overcome. Now the channels for employment are much wider than in the past, and the savings of urban and rural residents have increased dramatically, with a much greater ability to bear temporary unemployment than in the past. The scale of national construction is still very large, and after the projects are completed, some workers will also be needed, so as long as it is handled properly, there will not be long-term large-scale unemployment.

Of course, this does not mean that we can do nothing about unemployment. We should do everything possible to reduce unemployment. Many countries (including capitalist countries) have social insurance funds to provide relief to the unemployed population. In the past, China's welfare funds were borne by enterprises, and now some cities have established social welfare (insurance) funds to provide social relief to the unemployed population. China, due to the fact that the system of eating from the big pot has not been truly broken, the subsidy for losses of state-owned enterprises has increased from 900 million yuan in 1979 to 4.465 billion yuan in 1988. It can be considered to allow enterprises that are really beyond salvation to go bankrupt and use the subsidy for losses for unemployment relief and retraining for reemployment. The more the subsidy for losses is supplemented, the more it increases, and unemployment relief can be gradually arranged for reemployment or to find employment opportunities. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the number of employees in individual and private enterprises has increased by more than 20 million, and there is still a lot of potential to be tapped in this area.

The reform of the economic system of a socialist country is a great and unprecedented innovation. We have explored for 10 years and accumulated a lot of experience and lessons. Now it is very necessary to concentrate the strength of all parties to formulate an economic development plan for the near and long term as soon as possible and formulate a complete and mutually coordinated economic system reform plan, with a clear direction and gradual progress. Our wish is definitely achievable.

    牢记历史经验  坚决执行治理整顿的方针
    薛暮桥
    党的十三届五中全会通过的《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》，充分肯定了十年改革开放和一年来治理整顿的成就，如实估计了当前经济工作面临的问题和困难，继续坚定不移地执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针。全会强调指出，我们任何时候都必须坚持从我国的基本国情出发，牢固地树立国民经济长期持续、稳定、协调发展的指导思想，坚决防止急于求成、片面追求过高的发展速度的错误。这是总结我国40年的经济建设得出的最重要的经验教训。
    建国之初和六十年代
            初期的历史经验
    我们现在面临的经济困难，突出表现在通货膨胀尚未制止，经济结构很不合理。制止通货膨胀和稳定物价，是我们这一次治理整顿经济的一项重大任务。我国有制止通货膨胀的丰富经验，1950年3月一举结束持续了12年的恶性通货膨胀，不但使本国资产阶级代表人物十分钦佩，连外国的经济学家也视为奇迹。六十年代初期由于“三年大跃进”的错误而又一次物价上涨，也经过三年调整而顺利克服了。这两次通货膨胀克服的难度也是很大的，但是由于领导者决心大，上下一致咬紧牙关克服困难，不久就摆脱困境，走上坦途。为着摆脱目前的困境，很有必要回顾一下历史经验。
    1949—1950年，第一次通货膨胀的根本原因是大规模的解放战争，军费开支浩大。所以，克服通货膨胀和稳定物价，只有到解放战争在全国范围取得胜利，财政收支基本平衡时才能实现。1950年初解放战争基本上胜利结束，3月中央统一全国财政收支，而且达到收支基本平衡，这才使中央政府能够控制货币发行量，一举稳定物价。
    在当时，实现财政收支平衡并不是轻而易举的事情。当时经过12年战争，全国经济满目疮痍，人民生活十分困难。为着保证社会安定，不能不把大部分留下的国民党军队和旧政府工作人员接收下来，加上我们自己的干部和战士，政府需要养活脱离生产的人员达到900万人。周恩来总理曾经指出，这是首先需要解决的“胜利的负担”。陈云同志据此制订了财政经济方针，为着稳定物价，首先必须力保财政收支的平衡。为此，我们的经济政策，不但不能开始投资建设，连恢复经济也只能掌握重点，到1951年特别是1952年才提出全面恢复，进而开始进行一些社会急需的小规模的建设。由于领导者头脑清醒，不急于求成，这三年生产迅速发展，财政不但收支平衡，而且略有结余。尽管人民生活水平仍然是很低的，但一则比以前好得多了，二是对前途充满希望，相信会愈来愈好。因此全国人民满怀信心，对政府欢声载道，很快就渡过难关。
    1953年开始进行第一个五年计划建设，目标是为工业化打下初步的基础。限于实力，我们只能主要搞苏联援助的156项重点建设项目，加上自己的小规模的建设也只有700项。由于三年恢复时期生产发展很快，这时开始产生急于求成的苗头，到1956年出现了一次比较大的冒进。但由于领导同志（特别是周总理和主管经济工作的陈云同志）的头脑是清醒的，一有冒进立刻出来制止，所以财政收支基本平衡，货币发行不多，物价基本稳定。
    在第一个五年计划超额完成、社会主义建设和社会主义改造取得巨大胜利的时候，有些领导同志头脑发热，1958年开始出现了“三年大跃进”的严重错误。重工业连续三年超高速增长。生产上的急于求成，再加上社会主义改造上的急于过渡，1959年农业生产开始大幅度下降，1960年轻工业生产接着大幅度下降，1961、1962年连重工业生产也大幅度下降了。1958—1960年这三年出现财政赤字170亿元，货币发行从1957年末到1961年末增长1.4倍。通货膨胀加上生产的下降，物价就更稳不住了。在这种情况下，为了克服困难，当时所采取的主要办法是狠狠压缩基本建设投资，从1960年的384亿元，压到1961年的123亿元和1962年的67.6亿元，从而消灭财政赤字，到1962年结余8.3亿元。货币发行量从1961年末的125亿元，减至1964年的80亿元，物价迅速回落，如以1957年的物价指数为100％，1962年上升到126％，1965年下降到111％。在这几年从中央领导同志到全国人民真是咬紧牙关，依靠得力的调整措施，经过三年就基本上克服了困难。由于上下一致，同心同德，人民的怨言较少。在后三年，工农业生产迅速恢复，全国人民生活改善，心情比较欢畅。
    1966年“文化大革命”开始。生产几经曲折，但在建设方针上强调备战，急于求成的指导思想仍占统治地位，多数年份基本建设规模仍然过大，重工业发展过快，又一次破坏了农轻重的比例关系。这十年财政收支基本平衡，物价基本稳定，但这在很大程度上是靠牺牲了人民生活的改善而取得的。1976年人民生活水平低于“文革”前的1965年，也低于“三年大跃进”前的1957年。人民对此当然是不满意的。
    这20年经验证明，当我们面临着严重困难的时候，我们能从实际出发，实事求是，尊重客观规律，坚持正确方针，结果是迅速克服困难，把国民经济纳入稳定、协调发展的轨道。但是，在我们取得巨大成就、国民经济顺利发展的时候，往往容易被胜利冲昏头脑，使急于求成的情绪滋长起来，结果使国民经济的发展遭受重大挫折。历史经验告诉我们，在胜利时刻，必须注意防止急于求成情绪的滋长。建设投资的规模，必须同物资供应能力的提高相适应，人民生活的改善，必须同消费资料生产的发展相适应。一定要坚持财政、信贷、物资的综合平衡，保持国民经济基本比例关系的协调。一旦比例失调，经济发展就会大起大落，带来严重困难。
        五年调整和十年改革
    粉碎“四人帮”后，我们用两年时间进行拨乱反正，建立了以邓小平同志为首的新的领导核心。这两年，我们用主要精力来克服由于“文化大革命”所造成的国民经济的严重混乱状态，调整农轻重不合理的比例关系。1978年在急于求成的思想情绪支配下，又出现了一个“洋跃进”，加剧了经济比例关系的失调，经济调整的迫切性日益显露。因此十一届三中全会提出，在改革开放的同时，必须以更大的力量来进行国民经济比例关系的调整。1979年的国民经济计划重点是压缩基本建设规模，省出钱来提高农产品的收购价格和职工的工资，提高人民生活水平。在调整和改革的关系上，前几年要先调整、后改革。这不仅由于只有调整好经济秩序，才能为改革创造必要条件，而且由于我们的改革还没有完整的蓝图，需要不断创造经验摸索前进。实践证明，这个决策是完全对的。
      我们的调整工作几经曲折。1979、1980年由于许多同志对经济调整的必要性缺乏认识，阻力较大，压缩基本建设任务没有全部完成，而消费基金的增长则超过原订计划，因而发生相当大的财政赤字，货币发行量稍多一点，物价上升幅度较大，（主要由于提高八类副食品的销售价格，国家给了物价补贴），但因人民收入增加较多，生活有了显著的改善。为着压缩基本建设规模，1981年初银行来了一个急刹车，冻结地方和企业的存款，致使第一季度工业生产出现负增长（主要是机械制造工业，轻工业还是上升的）；第二季度开始逐步放松银根，这一年工农业总产值只增长4.6％，其中农业上升6.4％，轻工业上升14.3％，重工业下降4.6％。这一年固定资产投资比上年减少78亿元，是完成调整计划最好的一年，财政赤字和货币增发显著减少，物价基本稳定。接着1982、1983年固定资产投资仍然控制较严，因此生产资料的供应逐渐缓和，消费品供应增加，有些商品（包括棉布）还出现了“买方市场”。
      这几年农业生产由于提高农产品收购价格和推行家庭承包责任制而迅速增长，从而也促进了轻工业的迅速增长。重工业的增长速度比较慢一些，但除1981年外仍有适当的增长速度，农轻重的比例关系比较协调，1981—1983年积累率降到30％以下，人民生活显著改善，调整任务基本上完成了。
    1984年10月，党的十二届三中全会把经济工作的重点转移到改革开放上来，并且指出我国的社会主义经济是生产资料公有制基础上的有计划的商品经济，还说“越是搞活经济，越要重视宏观调节，越要善于在及时掌握经济动态的基础上综合运用价格、税收、信贷等经济杠杆，以利于调节社会供应总量和需求总量、积累和消费等重大比例关系，等等”。毫无疑问，全会所指出的大方向是完全正确的，但在实施中又发生了一些错误。
    实行新的经济管理体制，就要在保持财政收支平衡，控制货币发行数量，避免通货膨胀的前提下，逐步理顺价格，并在此基础上善于利用税收、信贷等经济杠杆进行宏观调控。遗憾的是，在1984年第四季度有关部门作出了1985年的信贷基金以上年的信贷总额作为基数，1985年的工资基金以上年的工资总额作为基数这两个错误的决策，以致银行竞发贷款，扩大基本建设规模。企业也竞提工资、发奖金。结果引起货币发行失控。这年第四季度的货币增发量比上年同季度增加146％，全年合计比上年增加49.5％，出现明显的通货膨胀。
    1985年上半年，由于通货膨胀而引起工业生产的超高速增长。针对这种不正常现象，国务院曾经召开四次省长会议，要求压缩固定资产投资，但当时全国上下都陶醉于经济超高速增长，采取的措施收效不大。银行继续把信贷基金的绝大部分用于固定资产投资贷款，许多企业开工后缺乏流动资金，能源、原材料的短缺也进一步暴露出来了。1986年第一季度，工业生产的增长速度降落到4.4％，许多人惊呼“滑坡”，要求放松银根。我在为1986年《中国经济年鉴》写的代序中曾指出：今年第一季度的4.4％，是同去年第一季度的23％超高速相比的，两年合计年平均增长速度超过13％。去年增长速度逐季下降，今年可能逐季上升，全年合计仍有可能达到8％，同去年的18％合计，全年平均增长13％，仍然是高速度。执行结果，1986年工业生产的增长速度达到8.8％。
    在这年的第二季度，国务院最高领导人的决策开始动摇，企图继续用通货膨胀来保持工业生产的超高速增长，致使宏观失控愈来愈严重。1987年和1988年，由于通货膨胀继续发展，物价涨幅也居高不下，最高决策人就企图抛弃十二届三中全会所说“理顺不合理的价格体系是整个经济体制改革成败的关键”这个正确的论断，想绕过价格改革来加速经济体制的改革。在这个幻想破灭后，又企图绕过抑制通货膨胀来加速进行价格的改革。1988年8月加快物价改革步伐的消息在报纸上透露出来以后，各地就发生向银行提取存款，抢购各种商品的市场混乱现象。党中央当机立断召开十三届三中全会，提出“治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和深化改革”的英明决策，迅速把这种风潮平息下来。
    十年改革的大方向始终是正确的，所取得的成绩也是十分巨大的，这决不应当否定。前五年把改革的重点放在农村，逐渐推及城市，在农村中逐步推行家庭联产承包责任制，效果是十分明显的，现在正在进一步完善。在不影响粮食生产的条件下发展多种经营，创办乡镇企业，鼓励城乡商品交流，这不仅大大提高了农民的生活，而且丰富了城市的供应。在城市中，我们逐步改变经济管理过分集中的弊病，扩大地方和企业的自主权，使它们有能力自我发展，面向市场生产适销对路的产品。我们改变城乡商业独家经营的办法，提倡国家、集体、个人多渠道经营，市场日益繁荣，就业人员显著增多。我们又提出我国还在社会主义初级阶段，必须在坚持社会主义公有制为主体的条件下，适当发展个体经济和私营企业，作为国营经济和集体经济的补充。为着加速社会主义现代化建设，我们更有必要对外开放，大力发展三资企业，办好经济特区和对外开放地区、开放城市，在这些方面都是卓有成效的。
    十二届三中全会的大方向虽然是正确的，但在实践中发生急于求成的失误。在还没有建立运用价格、税收、信贷等经济杠杆进行宏观控制的新体制时候，就过多地削弱了中央在计划、财政、银行、外贸等方面必要的管理权力，从过分集中走向过分分散，使宏观经济环境遭到破坏。并且在新的经济体制还未初步形成的条件下而急于提高增长速度，发生经济过热现象，产生新的比例失调。这次比例失调与“三年大跃进”以后和十一届三中全会以前的比例失调不同，前两次是过于突出重工业，农业和轻工业落后，其结果是生产发展了而人民生活水平下降；“三年大跃进”的后期还出现了农业、轻工业、重工业的依次大幅度下降，那时，我们是在工农业生产严重下降的情况下开始进行调整工作的。这一次比例失调，是在生产超高速发展的基础上，加工工业和高消费服务业发展过快，能源、原材料和铁路运输跟不上，投资和消费需求同时膨胀，物价大幅度上涨。我们是在工业生产高速度发展的情况下开始调整工作的。在这种情况下，人们往往看不到经济过热，只看到物价上升幅度愈来愈大，而不懂得物价上涨正是经济过热所引起的。因此，这次进行治理整顿，难度就更大一点，需要大家更好地理解历史经验，懂得坚持长期持续、稳定、协调地发展经济的重要性。
      治理整顿摆脱困境
    “治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序”已经进行了一年多时间，开始收到初步的效果；但离摆脱困境，还有相当长一段路程。最近召开的十三届五中全会估计，可能要三年甚至更长一点时间。近几个月，从表面看似乎形势还在继续恶化，实际上是向健康的方向发展。今年9、10、11月，工业生产与去年同期相比增长幅度降到0.9％、－2.1％、0.9％，因此又有许多人惊呼“滑坡”，要求放松银根，促使增长速度回升。实际上目前的速度是同出现抢购风潮的去年同期相比较的，去年9、10、11月，工业生产因抢购而超高速度增长，达到20.2％、20.4％、17.7％，观察工业生产发展速度，应当估计到这种情况。今年1—11月份工业生产同去年同期相比增长7％，全年合计肯定低于7％，国民生产总值可能增长5％左右，与国外相比，这个速度是不低的。
    今年第一季度，工业生产还保持相当高的增长速度（国营工业速度降低），但因能源短缺和原材料价格猛涨，盈利减少，亏损增加，生产效益继续下降。解决办法只能是加速能源、原材料生产的上升（这要相当长一段时间）和加工工业的下降，今年的低速度是前几年的超高速必然要产生的后果。
    另外一个问题是产品质量下降。由于财政实行地方包干制度，打乱了生产的地区分工，产棉区竞办小棉纺织厂，产毛区竞办小毛纺织厂，产烟叶地区竞办小烟厂。它们由于技术落后，用高档的原料生产低档的产品。无锡是纺织工业发达的地区，产品大部分出口创汇。但棉花是苏北地区生产的，被苏北的小棉纺织厂用掉了。国营厂生产60——100支的细纱可织高档布；乡镇厂纺32支甚至24支的粗纱，只能织低档布或棉毯，产值相差几倍。这也是今年工业产值下降的一个重要原因。
    比工业增长幅度下降更明显的是市场商品零售额的下降，从去年这时的市场紧俏变为今年的市场疲软。对生产者来说，这比生产增幅下降是更大的困难。但从宏观调控来讲，这将为我们调整产业结构，提高经济效益提供前提。去年抢购时有许多多年积压的低质量的产品也被抢购一空，因此，可以不管产品质量和适销对路而盲目生产。现在就不行了。在这种情况下，如果建立了竞争性的市场，要比质量，比成本，比适销对路，优胜劣汰，过去做不到的事情现在有了做到的可能。
    市场疲软在西方国家是一个灾难，在经济过热的我国可能是一个机会。我们应当抓住时机，大力调整产业结构、产品结构，这是当前进一步治理整顿的关键。只有抓住这一关键，才能把整个国民经济纳入良性循环。要下功夫，大大提高农业生产，努力促使能源和重要原材料生产稳定增长。同时大力调整加工工业，使加工工业同农业、基础工业的发展相协调，同市场需求的变化相适应。根据市场需求调整产品结构，增加有效供给。在资金、能源、原材料供应上，需要实行倾斜政策，支持优势企业渡过困难。对于乡镇工业，采取调整、整顿、改造、提高的方针，使之健康发展。
    当然，调整产业结构，要付出沉重的代价，首先是有许多长期靠吃国家大锅饭而生存的工厂有可能倒闭。过去几年在经济过热中涌现出来的投机性公司，国家已经下决心清理。这是肌肤上的一个赘瘤，不下决心把它割掉是不行的。有许多耗能高，用高档原料生产低档产品的工厂，可以让它们在竞争中淘汰，或者与大工厂挂钩并转。
    上述种种必然引起相当大一部分职工的失业，这是一个不容忽视的问题，但也不是没有办法解决。我国是一个人口最多的大国，除沿海少数地区外，从来没有过充分就业。十一届三中全会以前，在城市中有大量的待业青年和农村中许多人处于隐蔽的半失业状态，这样的困难经过十年改革，我们也把它克服了。现在是就业最饱满的时候，出现失业问题，只要全国上下同甘共苦，咬紧牙关过几年紧日子，并作好统筹安排的工作，困难是可以很快渡过的。现在的就业门路比过去宽广得多，城乡居民的储蓄急剧增加，对暂时失业有比过去大得多的承受能力。国家的建设规模仍然很大，项目建成后也需要增加一些职工，总之，处理得当是不会长期大量失业的。
    当然，这不是说我们对失业可以不做工作，我们应当千方百计减少失业。许多国家（包括资本主义国家）都有社会保险基金，对失业人口暂时发救济费。我国过去福利费由企业负担，现在少数城市已经建立社会福利（保险）基金，对失业人口可以施行社会救济等措施。我国由于吃大锅饭制度没有真正打破，国营企业亏损补贴已从1979年的90亿元增至1988年的446.5亿元。可以考虑让实在无法挽救的亏损企业破产，把亏损补贴用于失业救济和重新就业的培训工作。亏损补贴愈补愈多，失业救济可以逐渐安排就业或自找就业门路。从十一届三中全会以来，个体户和私营企业职工已经增加了2000多万人，在这方面还是有许多潜力可挖的。
    社会主义国家经济体制的改革是一种史无前例的伟大的创举，我们已经摸索了10年，积累了许多经验教训。现在很有必要集中各方面的力量，早日制订一个经济发展的近期和远景规划，并制订一个完整的、各方面互相配合的经济体制改革方案，方向明确、循序渐进，我们的愿望是一定能够实现的。
