The East German government spokesman, Mayer, announced on the 14th at a press conference that the East German government has decided to take measures to safeguard the normal work and production order of state organs and enterprises.

Mayer also said that the normal production and work order of all enterprises must not be disrupted, and the authority of enterprise managers must be recognized and further strengthened.

The spokesman of the East German Ministry of the Interior emphasized on the same day that the most important task of the East German People's Police at present is to maintain the dignity of state laws and systems, and to safeguard the interests of the state and the people from harm. The Ministry of the Interior requires local police to take on the responsibility of protecting citizens from violent attacks by hooligans.

In recent times, the phenomenon of using violence to threaten former State Security personnel, German United Socialist Party cadres, and German Free Trade Union Federation cadres has been increasing in various parts of East Germany. The normal production, life, and work order in some places have been disrupted to varying degrees.
