During the rectification and restructuring process, the Shandong branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has consistently focused on adjusting the credit structure as a central task, effectively supporting the stable development of the province's economy. From January to November this year, the 2,041 state-owned industrial enterprises with accounts at this bank saw their output value, sales revenue, and realized profits and taxes increase by 9.7%, 21.9%, and 13.4% respectively compared to the same period last year.

In adjusting the credit structure, this bank has considered both immediate needs and long-term trends, and formulated feasible implementation plans. In terms of adjustment goals, it has appropriately increased loans to industrial enterprises and recovered various types of loans occupied by companies. New loans and recovered loans have been prioritized for key enterprises with better performance. Sub-branches have categorized enterprises into three groups: first, industrial products are sorted into "protected, restricted, and prohibited" categories; second, commercial products are sorted into "smooth, stable, and stagnant" categories; third, various enterprises are sorted into "increase (appropriate increase), balance (self-balancing), and decrease (shrinkage)" categories based on their total funding.

While optimizing the increment of loans, the bank has focused its main efforts on activating the existing loan stock.

In the process of adjusting loans, the bank has implemented a three-pronged approach of "excavating, adjusting, and clearing." "Excavating" involves helping enterprises carry out "double increase and double savings" to tap into financial potential. From January to November, the bank assisted various enterprises in excavating a total of 2.23 billion yuan, an increase of 8.9 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. "Adjusting" involves adjusting the loan stock, clearing credit assets, and reducing and recovering loans for the third category of enterprises and risky, stagnant loans, to increase loans for the first and second category of enterprises that comply with national industrial policies. Various enterprises identified a total of 1.53 billion yuan in various types of unreasonable loans, accounting for 6.6% of the total industrial and commercial working capital loans. By the end of November, 7.8 billion yuan had been recovered, accounting for 51% of the recoverable loans. "Clearing" focuses on clearing mutual arrears between enterprises. This year, the province has cumulatively issued 6.3 billion yuan in clearing arrears loan startup funds, helping enterprises clear 3.7 billion yuan in arrears, initially alleviating the supply-demand contradiction of funds.

    山东工商行优化信贷结构
    两千余家开户企业经济效益稳定增长
    本报济南电　工商银行山东省分行在治理整顿中，始终把调整信贷结构作为中心工作抓住不放，有效地支持该省经济稳定发展。今年1月至11月，在该行开户的2041家国营工业企业，产值、销售收入和实现利税，分别比去年同期增长9.7％、21.9％和13.4％。
    这家银行在调整信贷结构中，既考虑近期需要，又着眼发展趋势，并制定了可行性实施方案。在调整目标上，适当增加工业企业贷款，清收各类公司占用贷款；新增贷款和收回的贷款，重点用于效益较好的骨干企业。所属各行给企业普遍排了三个队：一是对工业排出“保、限、禁”的产品队；二是对商业排出“畅、平、滞”的商品队；三是对各类企业从资金总量上排出“增（适当增加）、平（自求平衡）、减（压缩减少）”的贷款队。在优化贷款增量的同时，把主要精力放在活化贷款存量上。
    在调整贷款工作中，这家银行实行“挖、调、清”三管齐下。“挖”，就是帮助企业深入开展“双增双节”，挖掘资金潜力。1月至11月协助各企业累计挖潜22.3亿元，比上年同期增加8.9亿元。“调”，即调整贷款存量，清理信贷资产，压缩和清收三类企业贷款和风险、呆滞贷款，用于增加符合国家产业政策的一二类企业的贷款。各类企业共查出各种不合理贷款15.3亿元，占工商流动资金贷款总额的6.6％。到11月末，已收回7.8亿元，占应收贷款的51％。“清”，重点放在清理企业相互拖欠上。今年以来，全省累计发放清欠贷款启动资金6.3亿元，帮助企业清欠37亿元，初步缓解了资金供求矛盾。
