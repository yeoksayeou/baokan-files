	Huaiyuan County Cracks Down on Human Traffickers
	Over 100 Criminals Arrested, More Than 600 Victims Rescued

	BEIJING, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- "Mobilize the masses, find clues, investigate cases, and track down criminals," this is the effective method adopted by Huaiyuan County in Anhui Province to combat illegal marriages and crack down on the trafficking of women. So far, more than 670 victims have been rescued, and over 160 human traffickers have been arrested, with 108 of them already sentenced.

	In recent years, among the approximately 25,000 women from other provinces who have come to Huaiyuan, the majority are victims of trafficking. They come from more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions, including Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. These victims include workers, farmers, state cadres, and technical personnel, as well as university graduates and postgraduates. The criminals involved in trafficking these women are both from outside and within the county. They collude with each other, using various means to harm women, with some even becoming "millionaires" from trafficking people.

	Since July 1987, Huaiyuan County has established an office to combat the trafficking of women, with personnel from the public security, civil affairs, and women's federations assigned to this task. Through public reports, investigations, interviews, and setting up checkpoints at stations and docks, significant progress has been made. A young woman from Sichuan who was trafficked was moved by her buyer to six townships and 20 villages, but the rescue team persisted in tracking and pursuing her, finally rescuing her on the 59th day.

    怀远县严厉打击人贩子
    抓获百余名不法分子　解救六百多受害妇女
    本报讯　“发动群众，查找线索，以案查人，以人查案”，这是安徽省怀远县治理违法婚姻、打击拐卖妇女活动所采取的有效方法。到目前为止，已有670多名受害妇女被解救，160多名人贩子被抓获，其中已判刑108人。
    近年来，在流入怀远的约2.5万名外地妇女中，大多数是被拐卖的受害者，涉及四川、云南、贵州等20多个省、自治区。她们不仅有工人、农民，还有国家干部和技术人员，有的还是大学毕业生、研究生。这些拐卖妇女的不法分子，既有外地的，也有本地的，他们内外勾结，利用各种手段残害妇女，有的竟成了拐卖人口的“万元户”。
    自1987年7月起，怀远县成立了打击拐卖妇女办公室，从公安、民政、妇联等有关部门抽调专人开展这项工作。通过群众举报、调查访问、在车站码头设卡堵截，已取得显著成效。一名被拐卖来的四川女青年，买主将其连续转移6个乡20个村，但解救人员坚持跟踪追击，终于在第59天解救了这位女青年。　（赵其阳）
