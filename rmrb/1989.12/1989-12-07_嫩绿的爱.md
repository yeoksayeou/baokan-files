Everyone called you "Princess" because you were the "daughter" of the political commissar. In 1983, my father retired and returned to his hometown, and the two elderly parents spent three days and three nights persuading you to return to the mainland. But you were stubborn and refused to go. The adults couldn't understand your thoughts, so they left you behind.

You stayed, staying in the border defense area where your father had guarded for half his life, staying in a remote border town. That year, you were not yet 18 years old, with braids and a beautiful fringe on your forehead.

What did you miss here? The vast desert, or the desolate mountains; the raging cold winds, or the endless winter nights? People looked at you with surprise, truly puzzled.

Green—you said you loved green the most.

Indeed, born and raised in the military camp, the military camp was your cradle, your fertile soil, and your life was soaked in deep green.

In seventeen years of military camp life, you felt most deeply the difficulty of growing up as a child of border defense soldiers. They were not like city children, who could go to the park with their parents on holidays to row small boats, ride rockets, and drive bumper cars; from a young age, they had nurseries, kindergartens, and preschool classes, receiving good education. But there was none of that on the border. Children saw a desert from a young age, and their minds were also a desert. What could be done? The children's fathers had to guard the border, and their mothers also had work. The children became little animals without anyone to take care of them, locked in the house or tied to the bed legs all day. This was the childhood of border defense soldiers' children.

One thing left a deep impression on you. A child, because there was no one to take care of him, fell off the bed when his parents were not around, and his little life was gone. That time, you hid behind the adults and cried so hard.

So, you enrolled in the kindergarten teacher training class, stayed behind, and became the guardian of these little lives.

"Political commissar's daughter became a nanny, a girl..." Gossip floated towards you, and some of the children's mothers were also a bit worried. In their eyes, you were still a child. But in the following days, you won the parents' praise with your pure feelings and enthusiasm for the children, and also won the children's love.

The army built a kindergarten, and you were the only teacher who had received training.

You taught the children to sing, dance, and play games; you told the children Andersen's fairy tales. The spring in the northwestern border is short, and you always chased after the signs of spring, taking the children to run like little birds in the vast wilderness covered with green grass, welcoming the warm spring breeze, sipping dew, and bathing in the sunlight, letting the children enjoy the happiness given by nature. The winter in the northwestern border is pure, and you and the children weaved one winter fairy tale after another in the snow. Rolling snowballs, building snowmen, building a huge snowman. You exhaled thick mist, with a red face, leading the children to find their own world in this beautiful fairy tale.

Later, you and two other aunts built a simple playground in the kindergarten. You and the children played seesaw and slides together, and the children regained their lively and lovable nature, with wisdom in their eyes. Songs and laughter flew out from the children's hearts, scattering in the mountains and fields.

Loving children is a woman's nature, a mother's virtue.

Nowadays, children are all single children, little emperors at home, and little tyrants outside. It's hard to serve them. But you never frowned at the children. In hot weather, you changed the children's clothes and bathed them; in cold weather, you added clothes to keep them warm. Some children were picky eaters, but you always patiently coaxed them to eat bite by bite. The children's parents all praised you for taking care of the children better than a mother with children.

Do you remember, that time, Liu's little daughter Feifei had acute meningitis, and you were so anxious that you cried, hugging little Feifei and rushing more than two miles to the medical team. You ran so fast that when the child was in the emergency room, you also collapsed beside it, unable to breathe for half a day. The doctor said it was lucky that you sent her in time.

Do you remember, that year, just before the Spring Festival, the snow was so big and it snowed for a whole week, of course, the mountain was blocked again. A child's father was blocked on the mountain for more than a month and couldn't come down, and the child's mother happened to be sick, what to do with the child? You told the child's mother, "Don't worry, I'm here." Like a little adult. You took care of the child every day, dressing, feeding, and coaxing to sleep, taking full responsibility. The child's father came down from the mountain and saw the child healthy and strong, not knowing what to say, finally squeezing out a sentence, "You are better than the child's mother." You blushed, but you were happy, a kind of satisfaction that you had never felt before, what reward could be higher than being called a mother!

Year after year, snow after snow, mountain after mountain, how many such things happened? When the children's fathers went to the border, they always left you with a sentence, "Please take care of her." You could feel the weight of these four words, and you also felt a sense of responsibility.

Flowers bloom and fall, geese come and go, batch after batch of children flew away from you like little birds, and you felt joy, satisfaction, and fulfillment from the children.

Parents called their daughter in letters, come back, come back. Every time you received a letter from your parents, you would feel a hidden urge in your heart, but as soon as you saw the children, you forgot everything, and you poured all your feelings into the children.

You missed the green of the military camp. You also missed the children of the border defense soldiers, they were the new green...

    嫩绿的爱
    李振宇
    那时，人们都称你“公主”，因为你是政委的“千金”。1983年，父亲解甲归故里，举家内迁，两位老人费了三天三夜口舌，劝你一起回关内。可你就是执拗着不肯。大人摸不透女儿的心思，狠心撇下你走了。
    你留了下来，留在父亲守卫了大半生的边防，留在遥远的边境小镇。那年，你还不满18岁呢，扎着羊角辫，额头上飘着漂亮的留海。
    你留恋这里什么呢？茫茫戈壁沙滩，还是空寂的山野；肆虐的寒风，还是漫漫的冬夜？人们用惊异的目光望着你，真有点大惑不解。
    绿色——你说你最喜欢绿色。
    可不是吗，生在军营，长在军营，军营是你的摇篮，是你的沃土，你的生命里浸透了浓浓的绿。
    在十七年的军营生活中，你感触最深的是边防军人的孩子生长得不容易。他们不像城里的孩子，假日里可以跟着父母到公园划小船，坐火箭，开碰碰车；从小有保育院、幼儿园、学前班，受到良好的教育。可边防上没有。孩子从小眼前便是一片荒漠，头脑里也是一片荒漠。有什么办法呢？孩子的爸爸要去守边防，妈妈也有工作。孩子成了没人管的小动物，整天被反锁在屋里或是拴在床腿上。这便是边防军人孩子的童年。
    有一件事给你留下了很深的印象。有个小孩因为没人看护，父母都不在，从床上滚落下来，小生命没了。那次，你躲在大人背后哭得好伤心。
    于是，你上了幼儿师范班，你留了下来，做这些小生命的守护神。
    “政委的女儿当了小保姆，一个女儿家……”闲言碎语向你飘来，一些孩子的母亲也有些不放心。在她们眼里，你还是个孩子呀。可是，在以后的日子里，你用自己的纯真情感和对孩子的热忱，赢得了父母们的赞誉，也赢得了孩子们的喜爱。
    部队建起了幼儿园，你是唯一受过训练的幼儿教师。
    你教孩子们唱歌，跳舞，做游戏；给孩子们讲安徒生的童话。西北边防的春天是短暂的，你总是追逐着春的信息，带着孩子像小鸟一样在长满青草的旷野里，迎着和熙的春风奔跑，吮吸甘露，沐浴阳光，让孩子们享受大自然赐予的快乐。西北边防的冬天是纯净的，你和孩子们在雪地里编织着一个又一个冬天的童话。滚雪球，堆雪人，堆一个好大好大的罗汉。你喷着浓浓的雾气，仰着红扑扑的脸，领着孩子们在这美丽童话里寻找自己的世界。
    后来，你和另外两个阿姨一起，在幼儿园建起了简易游乐场。你和孩子们一起压翘翘板，坐滑梯，孩子们恢复了活泼可爱的天性，眼睛里露出了聪慧的目光。歌声、笑声从孩子们的心底飞出，撒落在山谷原野。
    爱孩子是女人的天性，是母亲的品格。
    如今的孩子都是独苗苗，在家是小皇帝，出门是小霸王，难侍服哩。可你从来没有对孩子皱过眉头。热天，你为孩子换衣洗澡；冷天，你给孩子添衣保暖。有的孩子吃饭挑剔，你总是耐心地一口一口哄着孩子吃。孩子的父母都夸你照看小孩比有孩子的妈妈还在行。
    记得吧，那次刘参谋的小女儿菲菲得了急性脑膜炎，你急得直流泪，抱着小菲菲风风火火地跑了二里多路，送到卫生队。你跑得太急，孩子进了抢救室，你也倒在一旁，半天没透过气来。医生说幸亏送得快。
    记得吧，那年快过春节的时候，雪好大好大，下了整整一个星期，不用说，又封山了。一位孩子的爸爸被封在山上一个多月没下得了山，孩子的妈妈不巧也病倒了，孩子咋办？你对孩子的妈妈说：“别怕，有我呢。”活像个小大人。你每天把孩子接过来送过去，穿衣吃饭哄着睡觉，全包了。孩子的爸爸从山上下来，见孩子顽健如常，不知说什么好，半天憋出一句话来：“你比孩子她妈还好。”羞得你一个大红脸，可你心里高兴，一种从未有过的满足在你心底油然而发，还有什么奖赏比获得母亲称号更崇高呢！
    年年大雪，次次封山，像这样的事有多少？孩子的爸爸上边防的时候，总要给你留下一句话，“拜托您了”。你能感到这四个字的份量，你同时也感到一种责任。
    花开花落，雁归雁来，一批批孩子像小鸟一般从你身边飞走了，你从孩子们身上体味到欢乐、快慰和充实。
    父母在信中呼唤着女儿，回来吧，回来吧。每回接到父母的信，你心里总会有一种隐隐的冲动，可一看到孩子，你便把一切都淡忘了，你把自己的全部情感都溶于孩子们的身上。
    你留恋军营的绿色。更留恋边防军人的孩子，那是新生的嫩绿呵……
