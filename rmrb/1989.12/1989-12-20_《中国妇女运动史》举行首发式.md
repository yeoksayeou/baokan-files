The launch ceremony for the book "History of the Chinese Women's Movement" was held today. This morning, the All-China Women's Federation held a commemorative meeting for the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Editorial Committee for Historical Materials on the Chinese Women's Movement, as well as the launch ceremony for the book "History of the Chinese Women's Movement."

Vice Chairman Zhang Zhuoying of the All-China Women's Federation presided over the meeting. A congratulatory letter from Comrade Deng Yingchao was read first. In her letter, Deng Yingchao said: "As an old women's worker and a promoter of women's movement historical research and compilation, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the comrades of my generation and the young comrades who have contributed to this work." She said, "The book 'History of the Chinese Women's Movement' is a song of praise for the tragic and glorious struggle of Chinese women under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to seek liberation, and a song of praise for the spirit of struggle and sacrifice of the pioneers of the women's movement, female heroes, and countless ordinary mothers, wives, and sisters. This great and precious spiritual wealth will have a positive impact on inspiring contemporary women to establish patriotism, collectivism, and the spirit of 'four haves' and 'four selfs,' to carry forward the glorious tradition of self-reliance and hard work, to guide the women's movement in summarizing historical experience, maintaining the correct political direction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and resisting the influence of bourgeois liberalization."

Participants in the compilation of "History of the Chinese Women's Movement" included members of the Tianjin Awakening Society, comrades who studied in France, old Red Army soldiers who established the Soviet areas during the Great Revolution, and old comrades who joined the revolution during the War of Resistance Against Japan, as well as experts and scholars in the field of history. The director of the editorial committee, Luo Qiong, introduced the process of compiling the book at the meeting.

Attendees at today's commemorative meeting and launch ceremony included Kang Keqing, Huang Qixian, Feng Wenbin, Sha Jiansun, Xie Shaoqing, and others.

    《中国妇女运动史》举行首发式
    本报北京12月19日讯　记者晓渡报道：今天上午，全国妇联在这里举行中国妇女运动历史资料编纂委员会成立10周年纪念会，以及《中国妇女运动史》一书的首发式。
    全国妇联副主席张帼英主持会议。会上首先宣读了邓颖超同志的贺信。邓颖超同志在信中说：“我作为一个老妇女工作者，作为一个妇女运动历史研究编纂工作的提倡者，非常感谢为这项工作作过贡献的同辈姐妹和年轻同志。”她说，“《中国妇女运动史》一书，是中国妇女在中国共产党领导下，争取解放的悲壮历程和光辉业绩的赞歌，是妇运前辈、妇女英烈，以及千千万万普通母亲、妻子、姐妹感天动地的奋斗牺牲精神的赞歌。这笔巨大而宝贵的精神财富，对于激励当代妇女树立爱国主义、集体主义和‘四有’、‘四自’精神，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，对于指导妇女运动总结历史经验，保持正确的政治方向，坚持四项基本原则，抵制资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，都将产生积极作用。”
    参加《中国妇女运动史》编纂工作的有当年天津觉悟社的成员，有留法勤工俭学的同志，有大革命时期创建苏区的老红军，也有抗日烽火中参加革命的老同志，还有史学界的专家学者。该书编纂委员会主任罗琼在会上介绍了此书的编写经过。
