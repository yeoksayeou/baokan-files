    Tonghua City in Jilin Province and the 81123 Unit stationed there have persisted for six years in conducting joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization, transforming this mountain city nestled in the heart of Changbai Mountain into a place with a fresh new look. Recently, Tonghua City was officially named a "Model City for Mutual Support" by the Jilin Provincial Committee and Provincial Government.

    Since 1983, the Tonghua Municipal Committee and Municipal Government, along with the 81123 Unit, have incorporated military-civilian joint construction into the city's overall plan for building spiritual civilization. Currently, the various units of the stationed troops have formed 70 joint construction points with the city's industrial, commercial, financial, educational, health, street, and catering service sectors. Fifty-four of these points have been rated as municipal-level or higher civilized units, with 12 points receiving commendations from relevant national ministries and the province.

    Persisting in conducting revolutionary tradition and "three loves" education is an important aspect of the military-civilian joint construction in this city. The 81123 Unit has a room of honor that records the unit's battle experiences and the heroic deeds of revolutionary veterans, which has become a base for traditional education for the city's youth. Since this room of honor was opened to the public, it has received over 23,000 middle school students from the city for visits and learning. The military and local authorities have jointly formed over 60 theoretical study groups, 210 propaganda teams, and a "three olds" (old cadres, old party members, old workers) reporting team. They have been active in factories, offices, schools, stores, and streets, educating the masses with revolutionary theories and historical facts to firmly believe in the Party's leadership and the socialist system. The military and local authorities have also jointly organized city-wide events such as the "Ten-Thousand-People Singing Contest of Positive Energy" and the "May Fourth Revolutionary Song Singing Festival."

    In recent years, the military and local authorities have used various forms to vigorously promote the spirit of Lei Feng, mobilizing all sectors of the city to learn from Lei Feng, establish new customs, and take action. A certain regiment of the unit, after jointly constructing with Tonghua Railway Station, established over 50 military-civilian Lei Feng study groups with the station's staff. These groups have been active inside and outside the station, doing over 1,600 good deeds for passengers. According to statistics, in the city's military-civilian joint construction points, 71% of the units have become advanced units in learning from Lei Feng.

    In recent years, the 81123 Unit has actively taken on the construction of local public welfare projects without compensation. Over six years, the unit has invested 145,000 man-days, planting trees, opening up green spaces, and improving gullies and rivers. The Tonghua Municipal Government has also helped the unit solve problems related to camp land, transportation, and living supplies; prioritized solving housing issues for non-military family members, especially those of war veterans; prioritized arranging employment and schooling for military family members; and properly arranged the resettlement of retired military officers. All 11 higher education institutions in the city are open to the military, and 14 enterprises and hospitals have become talent cultivation bases for the military.

    坚持六年开展军民共建活动
    通化成为“双拥模范城”
    新华社长春12月20日电（记者陈美凤、通讯员庞伟）吉林省通化市和驻军81123部队6年来坚持开展共建社会主义精神文明活动，使这座位于长白山腹地的山城换上崭新的容貌。最近，通化市被吉林省委、省政府正式命名为“双拥模范城”。
    1983年以来，通化市委、市政府同驻军81123部队把军民共建纳入城市精神文明建设的总体规划。目前，驻军所属各部队与全市的工交、财贸、文教卫生、街道和饮食服务行业的70个单位结成共建点。54个点被评为市级以上文明单位，其中有12个点受到国家有关部委和省的表彰。
    坚持进行革命传统和“三热爱”教育，是这个市军民共建的一项重要内容。81123部队有一个记载部队战斗经历和革命老前辈英雄业绩的荣誉室，成了全市青少年传统教育基地。这个荣誉室对外开放以来，先后接待市内23000多名中学生前去参观学习。军地双方还联合组成60多个理论小组，210多个宣传队，以及老干部、老党员、老工人“三老”报告团，活跃在厂矿、机关、学校、商店和街道，用革命理论和历史事实教育群众坚信党的领导和社会主义制度。军地还多次联合组织全市规模的“万人正气歌比赛”，“红五月革命歌曲演唱会”。
    这几年，军地双方利用各种形式，大力宣传雷锋精神，发动全市各行各业学雷锋、树新风、见行动。部队某团在与通化火车站共建后，部队干部战士和车站职工建立了50多个军民学雷锋小组，常年活跃在车站内外，共为旅客做好事1600多件。据统计，在全市军民共建点中，有71％的单位先后成为学雷锋先进单位。
    近几年来，81123部队还主动无偿承担地方社会公益工程建设。6年中，部队先后投入14.5万个人工日，植树造林，开辟绿化地，整治沟河。通化市政府也帮助部队解决营房土地、交通运输、生活供给等方面的问题；优先解决未随军家属特别是参战人员家属的住房，优先安排随军家属子女就业、入学；妥善安置部队转业干部。全市11所大中专院校全部向部队开放，14家企业、医院也成为部队的育才基地。
