    Fish and Water Depend on Each Other to Run a Good Enterprise
    —A Discussion on the Relationship Between Factory Directors and Workers
    By People's Daily Reporter Pí Shùyì

    How does wholeheartedly relying on the working class relate to implementing the factory director responsibility system? How do factory directors and managers rely on employees to run a good enterprise? These are issues that factory directors, managers, and the worker masses are currently concerned about. Recently, our reporter invited some award winners from the "Ten Years of Reform: A Cross-Talk" essay contest, who were in Beijing to attend the award ceremony, to discuss these issues.

    Fish and Water Relationship, Partner Relationship

    Zhāng Chéngqián (Director of Sichuan Dàxiàn Region Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory): The factory director and workers are like fish and water. Without workers, there would be no factory director. Without the worker masses, the factory director would be like a fish out of water. Therefore, the factory director must rely on the worker masses. In times of difficulty, rely on them, and in times of success, also rely on them. Workers are on the production frontline, working hard, and understand the production situation. The factory director must not forget the workers and should listen to their opinions and care about their hardships.

    Tián Wényuán (Office Director of Sichuan Chángshèng Machinery Factory): The factory director is also a member of the working class. Wholeheartedly relying on the working class also includes relying on the factory director. The factory director and workers have the same fundamental interests. The factory director is the legal representative of the enterprise and the manager, while the workers are the producers. However, the factory is state-owned, not the personal property of the factory director, and workers also have the right to participate in management. The factory director and workers are equal in status, both laborers. The factory director and workers must understand and support each other to run a good enterprise; only when the enterprise is successful can everyone's interests be realized.

    Wú Ràngpíng (Manager of Sichuan Dàxiàn Tongda Science and Technology Development Department): Factory directors, managers, and workers are all owners of the enterprise, only their roles are different. They are partners, with the same interests. The reform is making the factory directors, managers, worker masses, and the enterprise into a community of shared destiny. Everyone should work together to run a good enterprise. The factory prospers, I am honored; the factory declines, I am ashamed. The enterprise is a collective, a collective made up of workers. The working class only has power when organized. Factory directors and managers are members of the collective and leaders and executors of the collective will, with heavy responsibilities. Wholeheartedly relying on the working class cannot ignore the leadership and organizational role of factory directors and managers.

    Democratic Management and Strict Management Are Not Contradictory

    Liú Bǐngyín (Director of Henan Xiāngjiāng Refrigerator Factory): Democratic management of the enterprise and the factory director's strict management are unified. Implementing the factory director responsibility system, the factory director should dare to manage and manage strictly, while also giving play to the democratic management role of the workers, establishing strict management on the basis of democratic management.

    When I came to the factory in 1981, the factory had been losing money for three consecutive years, and four directors had been replaced in two years. After arriving at the factory, I first held a meeting with the workers. Everyone said the factory's labor discipline was too lax, making it impossible to improve production. I and everyone together made rules. On the first day, out of six or seven hundred workers, 200 were late for work, and according to the rules, they all had to be fined, from cadres to workers. The workers complied, and the next day it was better. Enforcing the rules and strictly managing the factory protects the interests of the majority, and the majority supports it. Workers hope that the factory director will dare to manage and not be a good-for-nothing, because the enterprise is responsible for its own profits and losses. If the enterprise does not do well, everyone will suffer, and workers need a factory director who dares to take responsibility and manage. Of course, the factory director should pay attention to relying on the workers. In recent years, our factory has established a spirit: "I will live and die with the enterprise." Workers care about the factory, and their enthusiasm is high. In 1988, our factory's output value, taxes, and labor productivity were all first in Xiāngjiāng.

    Respect, Care, Dedication

    Guō Gē (Director of Sichuan Dàxiàn New Star Coal Mine): To rely on the workers, let the workers understand and support the factory director, the factory director should do three things: respect, care, and dedication. Respect means to respect the workers' role as masters of the enterprise and to do a good job of democratic management. Care means to care about the workers. Both production and life should be cared for. Coal miners have poor working conditions and hard work. After I became the mine director, in addition to gradually improving the miners' income, I also enriched the workers' cultural life. I started the New Star Miner's Newspaper and established an art troupe. The workers themselves performed and established the image of miners. Dedication means to act with public spirit, not to seek personal gain with power. In this way, the workers will support you. Workers are most disgusted with those who seek personal gain with power.

    Tián Wényuán: Our factory's workers' congress is held regularly, and major issues in the factory are all discussed at the meeting. The enterprise management committee has 1/3 worker representatives. The factory director also often holds dialogue meetings with workers to directly listen to workers' opinions. Matters related to workers' immediate interests, such as housing allocation, recruitment, and salary adjustments, are all made public. Respect the power of the workers' congress, and issues that should be discussed must be discussed; decisions made by the workers' congress must be implemented. Last year, the factory director submitted a proposal on the economic responsibility system to the workers' congress for discussion, which was rejected by the workers' congress. Although the factory director had his thoughts, he still followed the decision of the workers' congress.

    Handling Several Relationships

    Zhāng Wànrén (Director of Sichuan Línshuǐ County Phosphate Fertilizer Factory): Relying on workers also requires dialectics, and several relationships need to be handled. First, the relationship between relying on workers and relying on advanced elements among workers. Second, the relationship between democracy and decisive decision-making. The factory director's decisions should be based on democratic management to improve the scientific nature of decisions. However, implementing the factory director responsibility system, the factory director should dare to take responsibility, dare to make decisions on correct decisions, and decisively decide on matters within the factory director's authority, not discussing every big and small matter. Third, the relationship between long-term interests and immediate interests.

    Hóu Dìnghé (Party Secretary of Chongqing Nántóng Mining Bureau): The factory director has four roles: first, as the state's representative, to be responsible for state-owned assets; second, the enterprise is a small society, and the factory director is the head of this small society; third, as the representative of the enterprise's legal person; fourth, as the representative of workers' interests. These roles have conflicts, and it is difficult to be a factory director. To be a good factory director, I think one should do the following: first, clarify responsibilities, with the factory director and workers clearly understanding their respective responsibilities; second, be sincere, truly and sincerely do things for the workers, care about the workers, solve the workers' difficulties, and let the workers see and feel it; third, be transparent, publicize factory affairs, and publicize major matters in the enterprise and matters related to workers' interests. Finally, be open-minded, and the factory director should think more about the enterprise, not seek personal gain with power.

    鱼水相依　办好企业
    ——关于厂长与职工关系的一次座谈
    本报记者　皮树义
    全心全意依靠工人阶级与实行厂长负责制是什么关系？厂长、经理如何依靠职工办好企业？这是目前厂长、经理和职工群众关心的一个问题。最近，本报记者邀请在北京出席“十年改革纵横谈征文”发奖大会的部分获奖者，就这个问题进行了座谈。
    鱼水关系、伙伴关系
    张成谦（四川达县地区棉纺织染厂厂长）：厂长与职工鱼水相依。有了工人，才有厂长。离开了职工群众，厂长就成了离水之鱼。因此，厂长必须依靠职工群众。困难时要依靠，顺利时也要依靠。工人群众在生产第一线，劳动辛苦，对生产情况也了解。厂长不能忘了工人，要倾听工人的意见，关心工人的疾苦。
    田文元（四川长胜机器厂办公室主任）：厂长也是工人阶级的成员，全心全意依靠工人阶级，也包括依靠厂长。厂长与工人根本利益是一致的。厂长是企业的法人代表，是企业的经营者，工人是生产者，但是，工厂是国有的，不是厂长个人的，工人也有参与管理的权力。厂长与工人地位平等，同是劳动者。厂长与职工互相理解，互相支持，才能办好企业；企业办好了，大家的利益才能得实现。
    吴让平（四川达县通达科技开发部经理）：厂长、经理与职工都是企业的主人，只是分工不同。他们是伙伴关系，利益相同。改革正在把厂长、经理、职工群众与企业结成命运共同体，大家都要为办好企业出力。厂兴我荣，厂衰我耻。企业是个集体，职工群众组成的集体。工人阶级只有组织起来才有力量。厂长、经理是集体的成员，又是集体的领导者、集体意志的执行者，责任重大。全心全意依靠工人阶级，不能忽视厂长、经理的领导、组织作用。
    民主管理与从严治厂不矛盾
    刘炳银（河南新乡电冰箱总厂厂长）：民主管理企业与厂长从严治厂是统一的。实行厂长负责制，厂长要敢于管理，严格管理，又要发挥职工民主管理的作用，把从严治厂建立在民主管理的基础上。
    我们厂原来是个小厂。1981年我来当厂长时，工厂已连续3年亏损，两年换了4任厂长。来到工厂后，我先找工人开座谈会。大家说厂子劳动纪律太松，没法搞好生产。我和大家一起订了制度。第一天，全厂六七百职工上班就有200多人迟到，按照制度要罚款，从干部到工人统统罚。工人服，第二天就好了。执行制度，从严治厂维护的是大多数人的利益，大多数人拥护。职工希望厂长敢抓敢管，不希望厂长是老好人，因为企业自负盈亏，企业搞不好，大家倒霉，职工需要敢于负责、敢于管理的厂长。当然，厂长要注意依靠职工。这几年，我们厂确立了一个精神：“我与企业共存亡”。职工关心工厂，积极性高。1988年，我厂产值、利税、劳动生产率都是新乡第一。
    尊重、关心、奉献
    郭戈（四川达县市新兴煤矿矿长）：依靠职工，让职工理解厂长、支持厂长，厂长要做到六个字：尊重、关心、奉献。尊重，就是要尊重职工的主人翁地位，搞好企业的民主管理。关心，就是要关心职工。生产、生活都要关心。煤矿工人劳动条件差，工作艰苦。我当矿长后，除了逐步提高矿工的收入，还丰富职工的文化生活。办了新兴矿工报，成立了文艺队，职工自己演自己，树立矿工的形象。奉献，就是要出以公心，不以权谋私，有好处不能往前抢。这样，工人才支持你。工人对以权谋私最反感。
    田文元：我们厂职代会定期召开，厂里的重大问题都要拿到会上讨论。企业管理委员会有1／3的工人代表。厂长还常和工人开对话会，直接听取工人的意见。关系到职工切身利益的事，比如分房、招工、调资，都要公开。尊重职代会的权力，该提交讨论的问题，必须讨论；职代会做了决定的必须执行。去年，厂长把一项关于经济责任制的议案提交职代会讨论，被职代会否定了，尽管厂长有想法，还是听从了职代会的决定。
    处理好几个关系
    张万仁（四川邻水县磷肥厂厂长）：依靠职工也要讲辩证法，要处理好几个关系。第一，依靠职工与依靠职工中的先进分子的关系。第二，发扬民主与果断决策的关系。厂长的决策要建在民主管理的基础上，提高决策的科学性。但是，实行厂长负责制，厂长就要敢于负责，对正确的决策要敢于拍板，属厂长职权范围的要果断决定，不能事无大小都要讨论。第三，长远利益与眼前利益的关系。
    侯定和（重庆南桐矿务局党委书记）：厂长有4个角色：一是国家的代表，要对国有资产负责；二是企业是个小社会，厂长是这个小社会的首脑；三是企业法人的代表；四是职工利益的代表。这几个角色有冲突，厂长很难当。要当好厂长，我想应该做到：首先责任明，厂长、工人明确各自的职责；第二，要鲜明，就是要真心实意为职工办事，关心职工，解决职工的困难，让职工看得见，摸得着；第三，要透明，厂务公开，企业的大事、涉及职工利益的事要公开。最后，要开明，厂长要多为企业着想，不以权谋私。
