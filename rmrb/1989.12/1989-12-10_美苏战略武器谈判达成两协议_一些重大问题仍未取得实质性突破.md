U.S.-Soviet Strategic Weapons Talks Reach Two Agreements
Some Major Issues Still Lack Substantial Progress

GENEVA, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) — The 12th round of U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons concluded today in Geneva. The two sides reached an agreement on mutual experimental inspections of heavy bombers.

The heads of the U.S. and Soviet delegations, Burt and Nazarkin, signed the agreement and exchanged the text during a joint press conference held today.

According to the agreement, observation teams from both the U.S. and the Soviet Union will visit each other's air bases. The host country will demonstrate two types of heavy bombers to the visiting team: heavy bombers equipped with air-launched cruise missiles and ordinary heavy bombers. This will enable observers from both countries to identify these two types of bombers during inspections.

The heads of the two delegations revealed that during this round of talks, the two sides also reached an agreement on experimental inspections of ballistic missile warheads. Through these inspections, both sides will be able to verify that the number of warheads carried by the other side's ballistic missiles does not exceed the number stipulated in the strategic nuclear weapons treaty. This agreement marks the first time in history that one side has allowed the other to inspect its nuclear warheads. Both sides expressed the hope that this agreement will be formally signed soon.

This round of talks began on September 28. Prior to this, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union made certain concessions to break the stalemate in the talks. However, these concessions did not lead to substantial progress on some major issues left over from the past during this round of talks.

The two countries' leaders recently expressed their desire to accelerate the pace of strategic weapons talks during their meeting in Malta, hoping that all outstanding major issues can be resolved before the next summit meeting. However, the path to negotiations remains difficult. As the head of the U.S. delegation, Burt, said at today's press conference, to reach an agreement before the next summit meeting, both sides "still have a lot of work to do."

### 美苏战略武器谈判达成两协议  一些重大问题仍未取得实质性突破

    美苏战略武器谈判达成两协议
    一些重大问题仍未取得实质性突破
    新华社日内瓦12月8日电  美苏第12轮削减战略核武器谈判今天在日内瓦结束，双方就对重型轰炸机互相进行试验性核查达成了协议。
    参加谈判的美国代表团团长伯特和苏联代表团团长纳扎尔金在今天联合举行的记者招待会上签署了这项协议并交换了协议文本。
    根据这项协议，美苏各自组成观察团前往对方的空军基地，由所在国一方向对方展示两种不同类型的重型轰炸机，即携带空射巡航导弹的重型轰炸机和普通重型轰炸机，以使两国观察员能够在核查中识别这两种轰炸机。
    美苏两国代表团团长透露，双方在本轮谈判中还就弹道导弹弹头的试验性核查达成了协议。通过试验性核查，确保双方能够核实对方的弹道导弹所携带的弹头不超过战略核武器条约所规定的数目。这项协议标志美苏两国有史以来第一次允许一方核查另一方的核弹头。两国代表都表示，希望这项协议不久能够正式签署。
    这轮谈判是今年9月28日开始的。在此之前，美苏两国为了使谈判摆脱僵局，都作了一定的让步。但是，这些让步并未能使双方在本轮谈判中就过去遗留下来的一些重大问题取得实质性突破。
    两国首脑最近在马耳他会晤时表示要加速战略武器谈判进程，希望双方能够在明年首脑会晤前解决所有遗留下来的重大问题。但是，谈判的道路仍十分艰难，正如美国代表团团长伯特在今天的记者招待会上所说，要想在明年两国首脑会晤前达成协议，双方“还需要做大量的工作”。
