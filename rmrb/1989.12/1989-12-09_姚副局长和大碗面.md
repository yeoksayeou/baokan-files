Late at night. On the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railway line at Beiheliu Station, Deputy Director Yao Changchun of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and foreman Guo Hongyue are inspecting the tracks together. They tap here and listen there, carefully checking every rail spike and examining every suspicious point.

Yao Changchun, originally the director of the Datong Railway Bureau, was later transferred to the Taiyuan Bureau as deputy director. He spends seven or eight months a year on the railway tracks. Wherever there is an urgent problem to be solved, you can see him on the scene. In 1988, when the embankment at Taiyuan South Station collapsed and Taiyuan West Station suffered water damage, causing the embankment to sink; in 1989, when the railway at Taiyuan Gujiao collapsed... Yao Changchun was there every time. He says, "The workplace for railway work is on the tracks, not in the office."

He goes down to the tracks, down to the base level, always starting with the locomotive, chatting with the driver, and then checking each car, looking at the performance of the locomotive, checking the level of management, and observing the quality of service. He never eats in the dining car, but rather goes to the work sections, work areas, and remote mountain valleys to eat with the workers. He loves eating big bowls of noodles the most. As long as there is noodle, with or without vegetables, it’s fine. The workers say, "Deputy Director Yao is easy to please!"

He came to the Taiyuan Gujiao work area to inspect the work. The cafeteria specially prepared noodles, egg soup, and a stir-fried dish for him. He took the noodles to the construction site, giving the egg to an old track inspector. He didn't touch the dish on the table.

When he goes down to the base level to inspect the tracks, his bag often contains a few large flatbreads. At mealtime, he takes out the flatbreads, breaks them in half, gives one half to the driver, and eats the other half himself, enjoying it thoroughly. Old Yao says, "I also like sea cucumber and squid, and I can even cook them. But I absolutely cannot use public funds to fill my own stomach. As long as the leadership sets an example, I don't believe that the wind of using public funds for extravagant banquets can't be stopped."

Old Yao always demands of himself the role of a public servant, saying, "Communist Party officials are here to serve the people. Where is the logic in eating, drinking, taking, and occupying the people's property?" There was a train conductor who came to see Old Yao, asking him to help solve the problem of being far from his elderly father and unable to take care of him. Old Yao investigated and found it to be true, helping him solve the problem. This train conductor brought two large bags of gifts to "express gratitude," but Old Yao sternly refused: "Do you think I, Old Yao, helped you solve your problem for this? You underestimate people too much." A businessperson from a subsidiary of Taiyuan Steel sent Old Yao an electric hot pot, and Old Yao was furious: "I, Old Yao, am not so poor that I don't have a pot!" A company in Gujiao City sent Old Yao a high-quality leather jacket, saying, "Our factory gives one to each person." Old Yao asked, "Can you give every railway worker a jacket?" The person had to leave.

Yao Changchun originally worked at the Datong Railway Bureau, and his home is in Taiyuan. When he returns home by train, he consciously follows the regulation that passengers can carry 20 kilograms of items. Once, he brought back 30-40 pounds of autumn cabbage to Taiyuan and insisted on paying the excess baggage fee to the train conductor.

In September 1988, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Party Committee made a decision to learn from Comrade Yao Changchun. Old Yao's honest and simple work style has not only become a well-known story but has also set an example for many cadres in the entire bureau to follow, encouraging them to be clean, selfless, and dedicated public servants.

    姚副局长和大碗面
    本报记者　王艾生
    深夜。在石（家庄）太（原）铁路线北合流车站，太原铁路分局副局长姚长春和工长郭宏跃一起巡道，他俩这边敲敲，那边听听，细心地检查路轨的每一个道钉，注视着每一个疑点。
    姚长春，原是大同铁路分局局长，后调太原分局任副局长。他像个普通的养路工，一年中有七八个月泡在铁路上。哪儿有急待处理的难题，一眼就能看到他在场。1988年太原南站路基塌方，太原西站发生水害，路基下沉；1989年太原古交线路塌方……姚长春都在现场。他说：“铁路工作的地点在路上，不在办公室。”
    他下路，下基层，总是先上火车头，同司机谈心，然后一节一节查看车厢，看机车的性能，查管理水平的高低，体察服务态度的好坏。他从不在餐车上吃饭，而是到工段、工区、山沟野外，同工人们一起吃。他最爱吃大碗面，只要有面，有菜没菜都行。工区的人说：“姚副局长，好伺候！”
    他来到太原古交工区检查工作，食堂专门为他做了面条、鸡蛋卤，还炒了个菜。他端着面条来到工地，把鸡蛋挑给老巡道工。餐桌上的菜，一口没动。
    他下基层，查线路，挎包里经常带着几个大饼子，吃饭时，他掏出大饼子，一掰两半，给司机一半，自己一半，吃得津津有味。老姚说：“海参鱿鱼我也爱吃，而且我还会做。但是，绝不能用公款肥自己的肚子。只要领导带头，我就不信，用公款大吃大喝的歪风刹不住。”
    老姚时时处处以人民公仆身份要求自己，他说：“共产党的干部是给老百姓办事的，哪里有吃喝拿占老百姓的道理。”有一个列车长，来找老姚，请他帮助解决远离老父亲不能照顾的困难，老姚调查属实，帮助他解决了。这位列车长拎两大包礼品来“感激”，老姚严厉拒绝：“难道我老姚帮助你解决困难就是为这个？你太小看人了。”太钢下属单位一个跑业务的，求老姚办事，送来一个电热锅，老姚气坏了：“我老姚不至于穷得连个锅也没有！”古交市一个企业给老姚送来一件上等皮夹克，还说：“我们厂每人一件。”老姚问：“你们能给我们全铁路职工每人发一件吗？”那人只好走了。
    姚长春原来在大同铁路分局工作，家在太原。他回家乘车时，自觉地遵守旅客携带20公斤物品的规定。有一次他把三四十斤秋白菜带回太原，硬是找列车长补交了超重费。
    1988年9月，太原铁路分局党委作出向姚长春同志学习的决定。老姚廉洁朴实的工作作风，已不光是被传诵的佳话，全分局许多干部在以他为表率，清正廉洁，克己奉公，甘当人民公仆。
