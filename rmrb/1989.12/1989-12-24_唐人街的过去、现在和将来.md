The vice-secretary of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese History Society, Shen Lixin, stated that, according to incomplete statistics, there are currently approximately 59 Chinatowns worldwide, distributed across 26 countries in five continents. Among these, there are 27 in the Americas (including 12 in the United States and 7 in Canada), and 13 in Asia (including 5 in Australia).

Shen Lixin believes that the formation of Chinatowns can be demarcated around the 16th century. Prior to this period, Chinatowns were the result of Chinese people seeking peace and engaging in commerce, with the majority of residents being merchants. After this period, the formation of Chinatowns was related to the urgent need for labor in the global capitalist market around the 19th century. Therefore, in addition to merchants, there were also large numbers of artisans, farmers, and intellectuals. Chinatowns began to spread across the globe.

Shen Lixin said that during the formation of Chinatowns, three major characteristics emerged: First, from an anthropological perspective, it is a material manifestation of overseas Chinese seeking familiarity. In this sense, Chinatowns are more of a way of life than a residential area. Second, it is a product of anti-Chinese policies in various countries. Early Chinatowns became a mix of a fortress, refuge, shelter, and slum, isolated from white society, serving as a self-protection and self-segregation enclave for Chinese people in the local area. Third, due to differences in formation time, customs, and the cultural background of the host countries, Chinatowns exhibit diverse characteristics during their formation.

Shen Lixin said that post-war Chinatowns have undergone new changes, particularly in five aspects: occupational distribution, national identity, marital status, diversified economy, and political awareness. Occupational distribution has shifted from the traditional "three knives" (cooking knife, barber's razor, and sewing needle) to the "six professions" (lawyers, doctors, university professors, engineers, accountants, and senior technicians). National identity has shifted from returning to the roots to taking root in the host country. Currently, over 90% of residents in American Chinatowns have given up their Chinese citizenship. By 1979, 44% of Chinese men and 56% of Chinese women had intermarried with non-Chinese. The economy of Chinatowns has also shown trends of large-scale enterprises, diversification, and internationalization, expanding from traditional service industries to manufacturing, finance, insurance, real estate, and supermarkets. Chinese people's political awareness is increasingly strong, and they have achieved certain successes.

In envisioning the future of Chinatowns, Shen Lixin believes that Chinatowns will not decline in the next one or two hundred years but will instead become more prosperous.

    唐人街的过去、现在和将来
    上海华侨史学会副秘书长沈立新说，据不完全统计，目前世界上约有59个唐人街，分布在五大洲26个国家。其中美洲27个（含美国12个，加拿大7个）、亚洲13个（含澳大利亚5个）。
    沈立新认为，唐人街的形成可以16世纪为界定。在此前，唐人街是华人和平经商的产物，居民绝大多数是商人。此后时期，唐人街形成则与19世纪前后世界资本主义市场急需劳力有关，故居民中除商人，还有大批的工匠、农民和知识分子。唐人街也开始遍布全球。
    沈立新说，唐人街在形成过程中呈现出三大特点：一、从民族学角度分析，它是海外华人寻同心理的一种物化表现，从这个意义讲，唐人街与其说是一个居民点，不如说是一种生活方式；二、它是各国排华政策的相应产物。早期唐人街成为一个隔离白人社会的堡垒、避难所、收容院和贫民窟的混合体，成为华人在当地的一个自我保护和封锁的小村庄；三、由于形成时间、风俗习惯和所在国文化背景的差异，唐人街在形成过程中呈多样性特征。
    沈立新说，战后唐人街发展已有新变化，突出表现在职业分布、国籍观念、婚姻状况、多元经济和参政意识五方面。职业分布由传统的“三把刀”（菜刀、剃刀和缝衣刀）变为“六个师”（律师、医师、大学教师、工程师、会计师和高级技师）；国籍观念也由落叶归根转变为入地生根。目前，美国唐人街90％以上的居民放弃了中国籍。华人与异族通婚者，到1979年，男性达44％，女性达56％。唐人街的经济也呈大企业化、多元化和国际化趋势，由传统的服务类行业扩展到制造、金融、保险、房地产和超级市场等行业。华人的参政意识越来越浓，并已取得一定成就。
    在展望唐人街前景时，沈立新认为，唐人街在近一二百年内不会衰亡，只能是更见繁荣。
