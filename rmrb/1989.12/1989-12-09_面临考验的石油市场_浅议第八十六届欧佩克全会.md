The Oil Market Faces a Test – A Discussion on the 86th OPEC Ministerial Meeting
Zhū Xiǎohóng

The 86th OPEC Ministerial Meeting was held in Vienna on November 25, amidst serious overproduction by some OPEC member countries and a robust demand for oil, which kept prices relatively stable. The quota dispute once again became the main theme of this regular meeting.

To resolve the issues left over from the previous meeting, after several days of consultation and tough negotiations, the meeting decided to increase OPEC's total production quota for the first half of next year from the current 20.5 million barrels per day to 22 million barrels per day. Kuwait's quota increased from 1.149 million barrels per day to 1.5 million barrels per day, Indonesia's quota remained unchanged, and the United Arab Emirates played a role similar to that previously played by Iraq, operating outside the agreement. The remaining countries increased their quotas proportionally. The meeting also confirmed that $18 per barrel remains OPEC's target price.

From the results of this meeting, it can be seen that the power balance between the Gulf and non-Gulf countries has become increasingly lopsided. The proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, the five Gulf countries, amount to 64.0479 billion barrels, accounting for 84% of the total OPEC reserves. Relying on their vast reserves and production capacity, they successfully achieved their goal of increasing quotas and maintaining oil prices at a reasonable level. The control over the oil market is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the Gulf group.

Opinions on the meeting's resolution varied, but most analysts believe it will put pressure on the market. Oil prices, under the influence of OPEC's high production and psychological factors, are likely to decline, especially by the second quarter of next year, when supply-demand imbalances will become more pronounced.

From the annual OPEC production situation, overproduction has been a constant phenomenon, especially since the third quarter of this year, when production reached unprecedented levels, currently at 23 million barrels per day. However, the strong demand since last winter has greatly eased the supply-demand contradiction, resulting in a stable and rising trend in oil prices.

However, the world economic growth rate for 1990 is expected to slow from this year's 3.3% to 3%. The Far East, as the most dynamic region in the world economy, accounts for only about 15% of the actual oil demand.

According to the latest estimates by the International Energy Agency, the world's oil demand (excluding centrally planned economies) for the first and second quarters of next year will be 53.8 million and 50.9 million barrels per day, respectively, with OPEC demand at 22.2 million and 19.1 million barrels per day, respectively.

If oil prices remain high, it will inevitably curb further consumption growth and encourage the use of alternative energy sources. The United States, the world's largest oil consumer, has maintained its oil consumption at roughly the same level as last year.

From the supply side, the situation is worrying: first, the new agreement's 22 million barrels per day quota is almost equal to the demand, but since some countries are not bound by the agreement, even if the remaining countries adhere to the quotas, total production will reach 23 million barrels per day. Moreover, Libya, which has always insisted on being on par with Kuwait, and the Gulf countries, whose production capacities far exceed their quotas, add to the concern.

Secondly, this year, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain have all seen significant production declines. The United States' production has decreased by more than 500,000 barrels per day, the Soviet Union's production is at least 10 million barrels less than planned, and Britain's current production is around 2 million barrels per day. Furthermore, U.S. and Soviet production is expected to continue to decline next year.

However, despite this, if no production accidents occur, non-OPEC supply is expected to increase from 29.59 million barrels per day this year to 30.1 million barrels per day. Once the consumption off-season arrives, the supply-demand contradiction will become particularly prominent.

Obviously, after experiencing three oil crises, OPEC, through several years of self-adjustment, has transitioned from "production cuts to boost prices" to a "high production, stable prices" phase under the inducement of demand growth, aiming to achieve different goals.

In fact, high production not only allows them to have a larger market share but also plays a role in demand regulation, keeping oil prices at an appropriate level and ensuring that oil maintains an absolute advantage in the world's energy consumption structure.

Therefore, facing the inevitable phenomenon of OPEC overproduction, demand becomes crucial.

In summary, we believe that in the short term, the oil market will be temporarily influenced by the psychological factors of market participants. Oil prices may slightly decrease, but the current strong demand and the possibility of a cold winter and unexpected events will still keep oil prices at a relatively good level, preventing a significant drop.

Prices in the first quarter of next year will be roughly equivalent to those in the first quarter of this year. However, if OPEC does not adjust production in a timely manner, the oil market will face a shock in the second quarter of next year.

Thus, the 86th meeting has become history, but it has left many difficult issues for the next meeting. The oil market will face a test.

### 面临考验的石油市场——浅议第八十六届欧佩克全会

    面临考验的石油市场
    ——浅议第八十六届欧佩克全会
    朱筱红
    第86届欧佩克部长级全会在欧佩克部分成员国严重超产，而石油需求旺盛、油价仍较坚挺的情况下，于11月25日在维也纳如期举行了，配额之争再次成为这一例会的主旋律。
    为解决上次会议的遗留问题，经过几天的磋商和艰苦谈判，会议决定将明年上半年的欧佩克总产限额从今年四季度的2050万桶／日提高到2200万桶／日，其中科威特的配额由114.9万桶／日增加到150万桶／日，印尼配额不变，阿联酋扮演着一度曾由伊拉克扮演的角色，游离于协议之外，其余各国均按比例增加配额，会议还确认18美元／桶仍是欧佩克的目标价。
    从本次会议的结果可以看出，海湾和非海湾国家两大阵营的力量对比愈加悬殊，沙特、伊朗、伊拉克、科威特和阿联酋五个海湾国家的已证实原油储量达6404.79亿桶，占整个欧佩克储量的84％，凭借其巨大的储量和生产能力，成功地实现了其提高配额、使油价维持在合理水平上的目的。石油市场的支配权日益集中到海湾集团手中。
    人们对会议决议反映不一，但大多数分析家认为这将给市场带来压力，油价在欧佩克高产及心理因素的左右下将向下浮动，尤其到明年二季度，供需不平衡现象将日趋明显。
    从历年的欧佩克生产情况看，超额生产现象几乎是无时不在的，尤其今年三季度以后，其产出更达到登峰造极的地步，目前已达2300万桶／日的水平，但自去年冬季以来的旺盛需求极大地缓和了供求矛盾，从而使油价出现了稳中趋升的态势。
    然而，1990年的世界经济增长率预计将从今年的3.3％放缓到3％，远东地区作为世界经济发展最强劲的地区，其石油实际需求所占份额却仅为15％左右。
    据国际能源机构最新估计，明年一、二季度世界石油需求（不包括中央计划经济国家），将分别达5380和5090万桶／日，对欧佩克需求各为2220和1910万桶／日。
    如果油价维持在较高水平，势必抑制消费的进一步增长，导致替代能源的侵入，世界头号石油消费大国美国今年的石油消费基本上和去年持平。
    从供应看，情况令人担忧：首先新协议规定的2200万桶／日就和对其需求量不相上下，但由于有的国家仍不受约束，即使其余各国信守配额，也将使其总产量达到2300万桶／日的水平，更何况还有一直坚持与科威特平起平坐的利比亚，及生产能力远在配额之上的海湾各国。
    其次，今年美国、苏联和英国产量均有较大幅度下降，其中美国产量下降50万桶／日以上，苏联比计划产量至少少1000万桶，英国目前产量仅为200万桶／日左右，并且美苏明年生产将继续萎缩。
    但尽管如此，如果不出现生产事故，非欧佩克的供应总量预计将从今年的2959万桶／日增加到3010万桶／日。于是一旦进入消费淡季，供需矛盾将格外突出。
    显然，经历了三次石油危机的欧佩克，经过几年的自我调整，在需求增长的诱导下，为达到各自的不同目的，已从“限产促价”向“高产稳价”阶段过渡。
    实际上，高产不仅能使其拥有更多的市场份额，而且还能起需求调节作用，以使油价维持在合宜水平上，并使石油在世界能源消费结构中始终占绝对优势。
    因此，面对不可避免的欧佩克超产现象，需求显得至为重要。
    综合上述因素，我们认为，从短期看，石油市场将暂时受到市场参与人士心理因素的左右，油价可能略降，但目前旺盛的需求及寒冬和突发事件的可能出现仍将使油价保持在较好的水平上，不至出现大幅度滑落的局面。
    明年一季度价格将和今年一季度水平大体相当。但如果欧佩克不随时调整产量，明年二季度石油市场将受冲击。
    至此，86届全会已成历史，但它为下次全会又留下了诸多难题，石油市场将面临考验。
