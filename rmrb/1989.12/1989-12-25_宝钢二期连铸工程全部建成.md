The second continuous casting machine at Baosteel, which combines imported technology with independent digestion and has a world-class process scale, recently underwent hot load trial production and successfully cast the first batch of high-quality steel billets. This marks the full completion of the second phase continuous casting project at Baosteel.

This project is a major construction initiative for Baosteel's second phase, featuring two large-scale continuous casting machines with annual production capacities of 200 million tons of steel billets each. Compared to traditional processes, the entire workflow can significantly save energy and optimize the quality of steel billets.
