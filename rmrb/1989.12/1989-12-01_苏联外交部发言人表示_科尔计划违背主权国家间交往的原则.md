Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Grentisky-Khe said on November 29 that West German Chancellor Kohl's ten-point plan for the unification of the two Germanys, proposed on November 28 in the West German parliament, "obviously did not consider the interests and opinions of other European countries, first and foremost the German Democratic Republic itself."

Grentisky-Khe said at a press conference in Moscow that the purpose of the West German proposal was clear: to bring the reform process that has already begun in the German Democratic Republic onto a nationalist track and to make it follow the reform path and content determined by the West German side.

He criticized the West German proposal for linking the further development of relations with the German Democratic Republic to a series of conditions put forward by the West German side, including the demand that the German Democratic Republic change its political and social system. He believed that this approach did not conform to the Helsinki principles and also violated the norms of sovereign state relations.

He also announced that, at the invitation of the Soviet government, West German Foreign Minister Genscher will pay an official visit to the Soviet Union from December 4 to 5.

    苏联外交部发言人表示
    科尔计划违背主权国家间交往的原则
    新华社莫斯科11月29日电  苏联外交部新闻发言人格列米茨基赫29日表示，西德总理科尔28日在西德议会提出的两个德国实现统一的十点计划，“显然没有考虑到其他欧洲国家、首先是民主德国本身的利益和意见”。
    格列米茨基赫在此间举行的新闻发布会上说，西德的目的很明显，就是要把民主德国已经开始的革新进程纳入民族主义的轨道，使其按照西德自己确定的改革路线和内容行事。
    他批评西德把进一步发展同民主德国的关系与西德提出的一系列条件相联系，这些条件甚至包括要求民主德国改变其政治—社会制度。他认为，这种做法怎么也不符合赫尔辛基原则，同时也违背了主权国家间交往的准则。
    他还宣布，应苏联政府的邀请，西德外长根舍将于12月4日至5日对苏联进行正式访问。
