Beijing's Used Motor Vehicle Transfer Office, established four years ago, has steadfastly resisted the trends of power-for-money exchanges and favoritism, and is known far and wide for its hard work, impartiality, and dedicated service. In April of this year, they were awarded the "Beijing Model Collective" trophy. Their experiences have been promoted nationwide by the State Materials Department.

This office is the only used motor vehicle transfer office in Beijing, with 11 staff members. Over the years, they have accumulated data on 217 types of used vehicles and inspection standards, and according to the requirements of relevant Beijing departments, they strictly control "six checkpoints" for each vehicle transfer: material flow, industrial and commercial administration, tax inspection, vehicle condition safety, social control re-inspection, and vehicle price amount. They ensure that honest people do not suffer losses, speculators do not gain profits, and lawbreakers do not pass through. They have handled the transfer of over 20,000 vehicles and have not had a single vehicle dispute case.

The staff of the transfer office correctly handle the power entrusted to them by the Party and the people, despise power-for-money exchanges, and use their actions to resist the bad practice of "no gift, no service." They insist on handling matters impartially according to policies. In recent years, they have refused hundreds of gifts and declined over ten thousand yuan in cash. Once, an acquaintance brought a bag of cash and called the transfer office staff member Yang Huimin aside, saying, "I want to transfer a car, here is 5,000 yuan for the service fee, is that enough?" Yang Huimin, after confirming that it was a car with an unclear origin, sternly told the person, "We handle cars here according to government regulations. A legitimate car does not need any service fee. Your car, no matter how much you offer, will not be processed!"

Another time, a seller tried to transfer a government vehicle worth 44,000 yuan to a private individual for 25,000 yuan through connections. The transfer office clerk Zhao Anping, according to the office's regulation that "public cars transferred to private hands should not cause the state to suffer losses," insisted on the price of 44,000 yuan. The other party took out 100 yuan and said, bowing and scraping, "Please, sister, give us a break!" which was firmly rejected by Xiao Zhao. Some state-owned enterprises attempted to sell old cars, which the government had clearly ordered to be phased out and could only be used by the state, to collectives or individuals for profit. The transfer office staff firmly stopped this. Some state organs, not following the government's regulations on social group car purchases, tried to bypass the "control office" approval, but were stopped here. Some people privately tampered with the wiring of good government cars, claiming engine problems to sell them at a reduced price to friends and relatives, but these were all discovered in time. They also assisted the public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs in handling over 60 case vehicles and helped the industrial and commercial and tax management departments recover over 250,000 yuan in various evaded taxes.

    北京市旧机动车过户办公室风气正贡献大
    经手万辆车  不贪分文钱
    本报讯　北京市生产资料交易市场旧机动车过户办公室成立4年来，坚决抵制权钱交易、徇私舞弊等歪风邪气，以艰苦创业、秉公廉洁、热情服务而远近闻名。今年4月，他们获得“北京市模范集体”奖杯。他们的经验被国家物资部门推广到全国。
    该办公室是北京市唯一的一个旧机动车过户办公室，有11名工作人员。几年来，他们积累了217种旧车的型号资料、检验标准，按照北京市有关部门的要求，每过户一辆车，都严把“六关”：即物资流向、工商管理、税务检查、车况安全、社控复验、车价数额，保证做到不让老实人吃亏，不让投机者获利，不让违法者过关。他们经手过户两万多辆汽车，从未发生一起车辆纠纷案件。
    过户办的工作人员正确对待党和人民赋予的权力，鄙弃权钱交易，用实际行动抵制不送礼办不成事的歪风陋习，坚持按政策公正办事。近年来，他们先后谢绝送礼赠物数百件，拒收赠款上万元。一次，一个熟人提着一包现金，把过户办工作人员杨惠敏叫到一边说：“我想过户一个车，拿来5000元活动费，您看够不够？”杨惠敏问清是一辆来路不明的车时，严肃地告诉那人：“我们这里是按政府规定办车，正路车不需要一分活动经费，你这车拿多少也不行！”还有一次，一个卖车人通过关系要将一辆价值4.4万元的公车，按2.5万元过户给私人。过户办业务员赵安平按照办公室规定的“公车转私车，不能使国家受损失”的原则，坚持定价4.4万元。对方掏出100元钱，点头哈腰地说：“请大姐抬抬手！”被小赵严厉地顶了回去。还有个别国营企业，企图把政府已明令规定即将淘汰、只能自用、不能过户的旧车，转卖给集体或个体，以此捞取好处，过户办的同志都坚决予以制止。有的国家机关，不遵守政府有关社会集团购车规定，想摆脱“控办”审批，在他们这里也被卡住了。还有人私下将公家的好车故意接错电路，以发动机有毛病而减价处理给亲朋好友，都被他们及时查出。他们还协助公、检、法机关处理各种案件车60余辆，为工商、税务管理部门收回偷漏各种税款25万余元。　（刘志荣）
