Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th.

	November's key economic indicators reveal several trends in China's current economic development: the decline in fixed asset investment is becoming more pronounced, the growth rate of workers' wages is slowing, the increase in loan amounts has surpassed last year's levels for the first time, and the growth rate of labor productivity remains sluggish.

	According to reports, the fixed asset investment by state-owned enterprises has been declining month by month. In November, it decreased by 13.9% compared to the same period last year, marking the largest decline this year. The total wages of workers in November grew by 13.9% compared to the same period last year, the smallest increase this year. The reduction in investment and consumption funds indicates that social demand is further being compressed.

	The increase in bank loans surpassing last year's levels is a new trend. By the end of November, the outstanding loan balance reached 118.24 billion yuan, an increase of 2.55 billion yuan compared to the same period last year.

	The slow growth in labor productivity indicates that the poor economic performance of industrial enterprises has not fundamentally changed. From January to November, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises with independent accounting increased by only 1.5% compared to the same period last year, a further decline from the previous ten months.

    十一月主要经济指标显示
    固定资产投资降幅增大
    据新华社北京12月26日电　（记者吴士深）今天在此间公布的11月份六项重要经济指标显示了当前我国经济发展的几个特点：固定资产投资下降幅度越来越大，职工工资总额增速不断放慢，贷款增加额首次超过去年同期水平，劳动生产率增速仍然缓慢。
    据介绍，全民所有制单位固定资产投资额逐月下降，11月份比去年同期下降13.9％，为今年以来最大的降幅。职工工资总额11月份比去年同期增长13.9％，是今年以来增幅最小的。投资额与消费基金的减少表明社会需求进一步得到压缩。
    银行贷款增加额超过去年同期水平，是一个新迹象。11月末，银行贷款余额达11824亿元，比去年同期贷款增加额多了255亿元。
    劳动生产率增速缓慢则表明工业经济效益不佳的状况并未根本改变。1至11月全民所有制独立核算工业企业全员劳动生产率仅比去年同期增长1.5％，增速比前10月又有下降。
