Papyrus played a unique role in the development, dissemination, and preservation of ancient Egyptian culture. To discuss papyrus, one must start with the papyrus plant. Papyrus is a reed-like aquatic plant with a blunt triangular stem, growing to about three meters in height, and can be used to make paper. Over five thousand years ago, the Nile Delta region of ancient Egypt was covered with lush papyrus plants. The ancient Egyptians, with their ingenuity and skill, used the stems of the papyrus plant to make papyrus paper.

The appearance of papyrus paper is closely related to the religious activities of the ancient Egyptians. They wrote prayers on paper to seek blessings and ward off disasters. To produce high-quality paper, wild papyrus could no longer meet the demand. Therefore, the ancient Egyptians began cultivating papyrus artificially, applying fertilizers and managing the plants at the right times, thus producing large quantities of high-quality papyrus, ensuring the flourishing development of the papermaking industry. Over three thousand years ago, Egyptian papyrus paper not only met the large domestic demand but was also exported in large quantities to countries and regions along the Mediterranean and Red Seas, making an indelible contribution to the civilizations of the Tigris and Euphrates and Greece. Currently, over 2,500 Greek and Roman literary works written on papyrus have been discovered, including Aristotle's famous "Constitution of Athens." Today, the English word "paper" is derived from the ancient Egyptian word for papyrus paper, "papyrus."

Later, due to changes in climate and geography, the environment in which papyrus thrived changed, and production gradually declined. Thus, the ancient Egyptians turned to the southern regions of Nubia and other places to cultivate papyrus. However, the true reason for the decline of Egyptian papyrus paper was not entirely due to changes in the natural environment but mainly due to competition from Chinese paper. Several centuries ago, shortly after Islam entered Egypt, it is said that the Arab Empire captured a Chinese papermaker during a battle with the ruler of Samarkand. From then on, the Chinese papermaking technology spread throughout the Arab Empire.

History often presents unexpected coincidences. After being lost for over a thousand years, the art of making papyrus paper has been revived today under the inspiration of Chinese civilization. During his tenure as the first Egyptian ambassador to China, Hassan Ragab was captivated by ancient Chinese culture. The restoration of ancient Chinese artifacts, especially the restoration of a large number of damaged ancient books, deeply inspired Ragab. In 1959, after completing his term and returning to his country, he decided to revive the long-lost papyrus paper-making industry. He faced two difficulties: first, papyrus had become extinct in Egypt; second, the papermaking technology had been lost for many years. Ragab packed his bags and personally went to the marshes upstream of the Nile in South Sudan to search for papyrus. Over two years, after numerous journeys and arduous efforts, he finally found robust roots suitable for transplantation and successfully cultivated them on the banks of the Nile in Cairo. Subsequently, he spent three years meticulously exploring the papermaking techniques and finally produced a sheet of papyrus paper identical to that of ancient Egypt.

Ragab established the Papyrus Institute in 1968. While working tirelessly, he also wrote papers and eventually became the world's only Ph.D. in papyrus papermaking technology. Currently, one of the important tasks of the Papyrus Institute is to repair damaged papyrus from ancient tombs and restore documents that have deteriorated or become illegible due to increased pollution over the past few decades. Ragab also plans to replicate hundreds of thousands of papyrus documents from various eras and store them in the famous Library of Alexandria, which is being reconstructed.

Ragab also designed a Pharaoh Village on the island of Yagoub in the Nile south of Cairo, planting papyrus along the riverbanks and canals, recreating the scenes of Pharaonic society from thousands of years ago. Whenever a new Chinese ambassador arrives, Ragab invites the new ambassador to visit the Pharaoh Village and introduces them to papyrus (see picture). He planted eighteen feddans (one feddan is equivalent to 6.3 acres) of papyrus there. During the summer harvest season, he hires hundreds of students to harvest and process the papyrus.

Today, under Ragab's efforts, the technology of papyrus paper production has spread widely in Lower Egypt, and the area of papyrus cultivation has reached hundreds of feddans. Ragab's contributions to revitalizing Egypt's tourism industry and promoting ancient Egyptian civilization will be forever recorded in history.

    纸莎草纸的衰落与复兴
    刘振堂
    纸莎草纸对埃及古代文化的发展、传播和保存起了独特的作用。说到纸莎草纸，当从纸莎草谈起。纸莎草系禾草状水生植物，茎为钝三角形，高三米左右，可用来制纸。五千多年前，古埃及尼罗河三角洲一带生长着一片片繁茂的纸莎草。古埃及人凭借他们的慧脑巧手，用纸莎草茎制成了纸莎草纸。
    纸莎草纸的出现，与古埃及人的宗教活动密切相关，古埃及人将祷词写在纸上，祈福禳灾。为了制造高质量的纸，野生纸莎草已远远满足不了需求。于是，古埃及人推行人工播种，适时施肥、管理，从而生产出大批优质纸莎草，为造纸业蓬勃发展提供了保障。距今三千多年以前，埃及纸莎草纸不仅满足了国内的大量需求，还大宗销往地中海、红海沿岸各国各邦，对两河文明、希腊文明作出了不可磨灭的贡献。目前，已发现希腊、罗马文学著作的纸莎草纸抄本就有二千五百多部，其中包括亚里士多德著名的《雅典宪法》。今日英语“纸”（paper）一词，即由古埃及语“纸莎草纸”（papyrus）一词演变而成。
    后来，随着气候和地理条件的变化，纸莎草赖以生存的环境改变了，产量渐减。于是，古埃及人转向南方努巴等地种植纸莎草。不过，埃及纸莎草纸衰亡的真正原因并不全是自然环境的改变，而主要是由于中国纸的竞争。十几个世纪以前，伊斯兰教传入埃及不久，传说伊斯兰的阿拉伯帝国在与撒马尔汗统治者的战役中，俘获了一位中国造纸工匠。从此，中国造纸工艺便在阿拉伯帝国传播开来。
    历史往往会出现意想不到的巧合。纸莎草纸工艺在失传一千多年后的今天，竟又在中国文明的启迪下获得了新生。埃及首任驻华大使哈桑·拉加卜先生在华任职期间迷上了中国的古代文化，中国修复古文物尤其是修复大量残破的古籍使拉加卜先生深受启发。一九五九年卸任回国后，他决意恢复早已失传的纸莎草纸制造业。他碰到两个难题，一是纸莎草已在埃及境内绝种；二是造纸工艺失传多年。拉加卜先生背起行装，亲自前往尼罗河上游—南苏丹的沼泽地带寻找纸莎草。两年里，经过多次跋涉和艰辛努力，他终于寻到可供移栽的壮根，并在开罗的尼罗河畔试种成功。接着，他又花了三年时间，潜心探索造纸的工艺，终于造出了一张与古埃及时期一模一样的纸莎草纸。
    拉加卜先生于一九六八年建立了纸莎草纸研究所。他一边艰苦实践，一边撰写论文，终于成为当今世界上唯一的一位纸莎草纸工艺学博士。目前，纸莎草纸研究所的一项重要工作是修补古墓里发掘的残破纸张和近几十年因污染加剧，造成质地败坏或字迹模糊的文献。拉加卜先生还打算将各时代遗留下来的上百万张纸莎草纸文献复制下来，存放到正拟重建的著名的亚历山大图书馆。
    拉加卜先生还在开罗南郊、尼罗河上的雅古卜岛上精心设计了一座法老村，河畔渠旁遍植纸莎草，再现了几千年前的法老社会生活场景。每逢中国新大使到任，拉加卜先生都要邀请新大使参观法老村，向他们介绍纸莎草（见图）。他在那里种了十八费丹（一费丹相当于六点三市亩）纸莎草。每到夏天收获季节，他就雇上百名学生来收割和加工。
    如今，在拉加卜先生的努力下，纸莎草纸的生产技术在下埃及广为传播，纸莎草播种面积已达数百费丹。拉加卜先生为振兴埃及旅游业和弘扬古埃及文明作出的奉献将永载史册。（附图片）
