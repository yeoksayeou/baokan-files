High Compensation for Induced Abortions Has Many Adverse Consequences

I have learned from relevant departments that in recent years, in the eastern part of Henan Province, high compensation for induced abortions has been implemented in family planning work, resulting in many adverse consequences.

Adverse Consequence One: Pregnant Women Blackmail Village Committees. In Yucheng County, Zhantie Township, a woman was pregnant with her fourth child. The village committee offered her 300 yuan to induce an abortion, but she thought it was too little and refused. After bargaining, they finally gave her 370 yuan, and she went to the hospital for the procedure.

Adverse Consequence Two: Some People Treat Compensation for Induced Abortions as Income. In Yucheng County, Xiaohou Township, a woman had three induced abortions or miscarriages in one year, earning nearly a thousand yuan in compensation. Some people say: "This is better than raising pigs or sheep."

Adverse Consequence Three: The Number of Unplanned Pregnancies Increases. Those with money become pregnant outside the plan and do not want to induce an abortion, so they hire others to do it. As a result, middlemen have emerged. In August alone, Yucheng County uncovered 25 such cases.

Adverse Consequence Four: Unplanned Births Cannot Be Eliminated. Due to high compensation for induced abortions and the expenses for abortions, sterilizations, and IUD insertions, village committees can only maintain their "revenue" by punishing those who have more children than planned. This creates a vicious cycle where those who receive compensation for abortions must have those who exceed the birth limit.

Providing appropriate nutritional compensation to those who undergo induced abortions was a measure taken in the past when the public did not fully understand the significance of family planning. In recent years, the compensation amount has been increasing year by year, even becoming a form of exchange and bargaining. Some women who are pregnant with their third, fourth, or even fifth child boldly set prices and sell their pregnancies. I believe that high compensation should be abolished; ideological work should be strengthened. Only then can family planning work develop in the correct direction.

### 高额引产补助的恶果

    高额引产补助的恶果
    我从有关部门获悉，豫东农村，近年来在计划生育工作中实行高额引产补助，恶果甚多。
    恶果之一：孕妇要挟村委会。虞城县站集乡有个妇女怀第4胎，村委会给她300元补助让她去引产，她嫌少，不去。经讨价还价，最后给她370元才去医院作了手术。
    恶果之二：有人把引产补助当作一项收入。虞城县小侯乡一个妇女一年引产、流产3次，获得补助费近千元。有人说：这比喂猪喂羊强。
    恶果之三：计划外怀孕者增多。有钱者计划外怀孕，不愿引产，便雇人代引。应运而生还出来中间“经纪人”。仅8月份，虞城县就查获此类事件25起。
    恶果之四：计划外生育无法杜绝。由于引产高额补助，加上流产、结扎、上环等费用开支，村委会只能用惩罚超生户来维持“财源”。这样就出现了补助受术户，必有超生户的恶性循环。
    给引产者以适当的营养补助，是过去群众对计划生育的意义不甚了解的情况下采取的。近几年补助额逐年上升，甚至变成了一种交换条件，讨价还价。有的3胎、4胎甚至5胎的怀孕者，理直气壮指腹标价，实行卖胎。我认为，高额补助，应该废除；思想工作，应当加强。这样计划生育工作才能沿着正确方向发展。
