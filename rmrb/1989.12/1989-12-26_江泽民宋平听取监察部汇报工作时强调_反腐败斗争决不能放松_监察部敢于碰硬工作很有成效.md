	Jiang Zemin and Song Ping recently listened to a work report from Wei Jianxing, the Minister of the Supervision Department, and other comrades, and delivered important speeches. They emphasized in their speeches that the fight against corruption must not be relaxed.

	After listening to the report, Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the work of the supervisory organs, believing that since the establishment of the Supervision Department, the work has been very effective, daring to tackle hard cases, and laying a solid foundation. The supervisory organs have correctly focused on anti-corruption as a key task for the current and future period. Our anti-corruption campaign must not be relaxed. Supervisory organs should firmly investigate and deal with major cases. The Central Committee of the Party and the State Council fully support the work of the supervisory organs.

	Song Ping pointed out in his speech that the Party Central Committee and the State Council are resolute in their attitude towards opposing corruption and strengthening clean governance, and will not relax. Supervisory organs should not only investigate and deal with cases of embezzlement, bribery, and power for personal gain, but also pay attention to seriously investigating and dealing with those who fail to follow orders, violate prohibitions, and engage in serious dereliction of duty.
