On the morning of December 16th, shortly after the hijacking of CA981 international flight, a reporter from this newspaper quickly learned of the incident. Through on-site interviews at Hongqiao Airport and a special report from Tokyo, the reporter learned about how relevant parties on the ground and in the air worked together to cleverly foil the hijacking plot.

The Criminal Enters the Cockpit

At 10:51 AM, CA981 flight, a Boeing 747, took off from Beijing Airport after a 50-minute delay. Ten minutes later, the wide-body aircraft had just reached its cruising altitude and entered normal flight. A man in his 30s in the cabin handed a piece of paper to a flight attendant. The paper read: "Fly to Seoul, or else I'll blow up the plane." The flight attendant immediately refused. The criminal then seized the opportunity to enter the cockpit and forced the pilot to fly to Seoul.

The Ground Prepares for Battle

About 30 minutes after the criminal entered the cockpit, the plane was still flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters over Shanghai. The reporter had already received the news and immediately rushed to Hongqiao Airport for an interview.

At this time, the airport control tower had established a ground command center for the hijacking incident. Anti-hijacking forces, bomb disposal units, police, and firefighters were all in position on the tarmac, ready for action. Leaders from the municipal party committee and government quickly arrived at the ground command center, calmly directing this special battle.

The "Confusion" in the Air

Following the ground command, the crew led by Captain Xue Renshan flew the plane in circles near Shanghai airspace to confuse the criminal and attempt to land the plane at Hongqiao Airport. The criminal, Zhang Zhenhai, was raging on the plane. To ensure the safety of the 200 passengers on board, after obtaining permission from the ground, the Boeing 747 temporarily flew towards Seoul.

The plane entered South Korean airspace 96 kilometers south of Jeju Island. The South Korean air force immediately dispatched two fighter jets for aerial surveillance. Seoul's Gimpo Airport communicated with the Boeing 747 and refused to allow the plane to land.

Landing in Japan's Fukuoka

Captain Xue Renshan, with his rich flying experience, and the crew displayed extraordinary wisdom and bravery. After receiving the response from Gimpo, Captain Xue deceived the criminal and quietly changed the flight path, heading towards Japan. At the same time, he contacted Fukuoka Airport in Japan, informing them that the plane had only 40 minutes of fuel left and requested permission to land in Fukuoka. The Boeing 747 changed its course over Jeju Island at 12:51 PM.

At 12:53 PM, two F-1 fighter jets from the Fukuoka airbase took off urgently, and at 1:27 PM, two F-4 fighter jets from the Niiyama base in Miyazaki Prefecture took to the skies, simultaneously implementing aerial surveillance for the Boeing 747 to land in Fukuoka.

At 1:53 PM, the wide-body aircraft landed at Fukuoka Airport. At 2:00 PM, the Japanese government established a response headquarters led by Forest Mountain, the Chief Cabinet Secretary. At 2:02 PM, Japanese police approached the Boeing 747 parked at Fukuoka Airport, getting within 100 meters of the plane. At 2:03 PM, the hijacker Zhang Zhenhai demanded that the Japanese police prepare a car for him.

Push Him Out of the Cabin!

At this moment, another wise and brave action by the crew unfolded: a flight attendant opened the emergency exit door on the right rear of the plane and told Zhang Zhenhai, "Seoul has arrived." The criminal thought his plot had succeeded and stuck his head out to look.

In an instant, the crew took advantage of the criminal's moment of distraction and pushed Zhang Zhenhai out of the door. The criminal fell heavily from the 5-meter-high Boeing 747 door to the runway. Japanese police rushed forward and captured the 35-year-old criminal.

It was 2:05 PM Beijing time.

A hijacking plot was completely foiled by the crew.

According to yesterday's news from Tokyo, the criminal Zhang Zhenhai is now in the Mukimura Orthopedic Hospital in Fukuoka. It is reported that he has fractures in his spine and pelvis and will need at least a few months of treatment.

    ——一二·一六国际航班劫机事件记详
    朱国顺
    12月16日上午，CA981国际航班被劫持后不多久，本报记者迅速得知了这一消息。记者通过在虹桥机场实地采访以及东京专电，了解到我有关方面陆空一体，协同配合，机智粉碎劫机阴谋的经过。
    歹徒窜入驾驶舱
    这天上午10时51分，CA981航班波音747客机在起飞时间推迟50分钟后，从北京机场滑行升空。10分钟后，这架宽体客机刚刚爬行至巡航高度，进入正常航线飞行。机舱内一名30多岁的男子将一张纸币交给空中小姐，纸币上写着：“开往汉城，否则引爆飞机。”当即遭到空中小姐严词拒绝。这名歹徒伺机窜入驾驶舱，胁迫机长将飞机开往汉城。
      地面严阵以待
    歹徒窜入机舱约30分钟后，飞机尚在飞往上海的万米高空，本报记者已得知消息，立即以最快速度到虹桥机场采访。
    机场控制塔内此时成立了劫机事件地面指挥部。停机坪旁，我反劫机部队、防爆部队以及巡警、消防部队先后到位，严阵以待。市委、市政府有关领导迅速来到地面指挥部，紧张而又沉着地指挥这场特殊的战斗。
    空中“迷魂阵”
    以机长薛仁山为首的机组人员遵照地面指挥，在接近上海空域盘旋，以迷惑歹徒，设法将客机降落虹桥机场。歹徒张振海在机上疯狂叫嚣。为保证机上200名中外旅客安全，在请示地面同意后，这架波音747客机暂时向汉城方向飞去。
    飞机在南朝鲜济州岛以南96公里处进入南朝鲜领空。南朝鲜空军立即出动两架战斗机，进行空中警戒。汉城金浦机场与波音747通话，拒绝客机在金浦着陆。
    降落日本福冈
    具有丰富空中经验的薛机长以及机组人员，此时表现出非凡的机智和勇敢。薛机长在得到金浦回答后，将歹徒蒙在鼓里，悄悄拨转航向，将飞机朝日本方向飞去。同时与日本福冈机场联系，告知机上燃油仅剩40分钟航程，请求在福冈着陆。波音747客机12时51分在南朝鲜济州岛上空改变航向。
    12时53分，福冈空军基地两架F—1战斗机紧急起飞，1时27分，宫崎县新田原基地两架F—4战斗机升空，同时实行波音747在福冈降落的空中警戒。
    下午1时53分，这架宽体客机在福冈机场着陆。2时，日本政府成立了以森山官房长官为首的对策本部。2时零2分，日本警方向停在福冈机场的波音747飞机接近，接近至距客机100米处。2时零3分，劫机歹徒张振海声言要日本警方为他准备汽车。
    将他推出机舱！
    此时，我机组人员又一幕机智英勇的行动出现了：一位乘务员打开了飞机右后方的紧急出口舱门，对张振海说：“你要去的汉城到了。”张犯以为阴谋成功，将头伸出舱外观看。
    刹那之间，我机组人员乘张犯探头张望之际，一举将张振海推出舱门。张犯从5米多高的波音747舱门口重重摔落到跑道。日本警察上前，抓获了这名35岁的歹徒。
    此刻是北京时间下午2时零5分。
    一次空中劫机阴谋被我机组人员彻底粉碎了。
    据昨天东京消息，歹徒张振海现被收入福冈市内木村外科病院。据查，背椎及盆骨骨折，至少得治疗几个月。
