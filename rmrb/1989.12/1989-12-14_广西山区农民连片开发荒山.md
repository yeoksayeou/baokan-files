Farmers in Guangxi's mountainous regions are developing wasteland in large patches. The hope is in the mountains, the potential is in the mountains, and the advantage is in the mountains. This consensus among the farmers in Guangxi's mountainous regions has made the development of wasteland gradually take shape.

According to preliminary investigations, farmers in the western and northern parts of Guangxi, led by the Baise region, are developing wasteland in large patches to plant mangoes, hawthorns, star anise, tea, tung oil trees, Chinese firs, and sugarcane, among other forest and fruit crops. The area is at least 3.5 million mu (approximately 233,333 hectares). Among these, there are 61 mango orchards alone that are each over 100 mu (approximately 6.67 hectares) in size.
