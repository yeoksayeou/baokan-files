    Greedy Woman Kidnaps and Sells Child; Family Reunited After Case Solved
    By Wáng Jiànwǔ and Qiáo Yáng
    1989-12-08, 7:50 PM, the 2nd express train from Changsha to Beijing slowly pulled into Beijing Railway Station.
    The door of car 6 opened, and a young police officer carried a 3-year-old boy off the train. At that moment, the boy's mother, who had been eagerly waiting on the platform, rushed forward, embraced her child, and cried, "This is my child, this is my child!" The boy's father also rushed over, and the family embraced, crying with joy.
    The kidnapped child was named Zhang Zhitao. He was innocent and lovable. On May 26, 1989, the Chaoyang Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Team received a report and immediately organized personnel to investigate the case.
    The family originally had a young maid, but later the maid left without notice, and the child Zhang Zhitao also disappeared without a trace. With the guidance of the investigators, Zhang Zhitao's mother, Lü Huā'ē, recalled that when she met the maid at Hebei Hebei Railway Station, the maid said she had come by bicycle and sold it to an old man at a small shop outside the station. With the assistance of the local police station, the investigators finally found the bicycle. Through the bicycle's license plate number, they identified the owner as an official from the Personnel Bureau of Mancheng County, Hebei. This official stated: "The maid claimed to be Zhang Xiaoying and said she was from Suining City, Sichuan."
    The investigators contacted the Sichuan Public Security Bureau, but after several weeks, they received a telegram stating "No such person exists." It seemed that Zhang Xiaoying was a false name used by the criminal to hide her identity.
    Interestingly, one day, an officer from the Suining Public Security Bureau saw an advertisement in the local newspaper seeking a person named Xu Chenghua, whose physical characteristics matched those of Zhang Xiaoying. After investigation, it was confirmed that the maid who had used the false name Zhang Xiaoying was indeed Xu Chenghua. On November 27, 1989, Xu Chenghua appeared in Suining City and was apprehended by the local public security authorities.
    On November 29, Chaoyang Public Security Bureau detectives Tang Tiemin, Yao Xiaomei, and Liu Haitao traveled to Suining to rescue the kidnapped Zhang Zhitao.
    Upon arriving in Suining, the three detectives immediately began interrogating the suspect. Through the interrogation, Xu Chenghua admitted to kidnapping Zhang Zhitao and revealed that Zhang Zhitao had been sold to a female teacher in Anyang, Henan. It turned out that Xu Chenghua had taken Zhang Zhitao by train to Anyang, Henan. She lied, saying the child was her nephew, whose mother had died and whose father had been injured in an accident, leaving him unable to care for the child. A middle-aged woman who could not have children took them to her home. The next day, while Xu Chenghua was on her way to the middle-aged woman's house to collect the money, she passed by a police station. Fearful that her crime had been discovered, she did not dare to collect the money and quietly slipped away. She only remembered that the buyer had a 10-year-old girl named Kong Yang and lived near a water and electricity police station.
    This information was quickly relayed to Beijing, and the Chaoyang Public Security Bureau immediately decided to send Criminal Investigation Team Deputy Director Wei Jinxiang to Anyang to find the middle-aged woman, while ordering Tang Tiemin and the other two to bring the suspect to Anyang for a meeting.
    The police escorted the suspect in a taxi and, after several twists and turns, found the middle-aged woman's residence.
    It turned out that the buyer was a female teacher. After adopting Zhang Zhitao, she changed his name to Yang Guang and, over the past half year, taught him to recite poems and recognize characters, showing him great care. After patient persuasion by the investigators, the female teacher, tears in her eyes, handed over the child.
    On the way back to Beijing, the investigators cared for Zhang Zhitao like parents. As they approached Beijing, they even took the time to wash his face, trim his nails, and change his clothes.

    贪财女拐卖幼童  破案后母子团圆
    王建武　晁阳
    1989年12月8日晚7点50分，从长沙开往北京的2次特快列车，缓缓停靠在北京火车站。
    6号车厢门开了，一位年轻民警抱着一个3岁左右的男孩走下火车。这时，站台上翘首盼望孩子的母亲冲上前，一把搂住孩子，泣不成声地说：“这是我的孩子，是我的孩子！”孩子的父亲也扑过来，一家人激动得抱头痛哭。
    被拐卖的幼童叫张志涛，他天真可爱。1989年5月26日，朝阳公安分局刑警队接到报案，立即组织人力侦破。
    出事者家里原来有个小保姆，后来小保姆不辞而别，小孩张志涛也无踪无影。在侦察员的启发下，小志涛的妈妈吕花娥说，在河北?河火车站同小保姆相识时，小保姆说是骑车来的，自行车卖给了车站外一个杂货铺的老头。在当地派出所协助下，侦察员们终于查找到自行车下落，通过查找车牌号，自行车主人是河北满城县人事局的一位干部。这位干部说：“那个小保姆自称张晓英，家在四川遂宁市。”
    侦察员同四川公安部门取得了联系，可是几个星期过去了，等到的却是
  “查无此人”的一纸电文。看来，张晓英定是案犯用以隐身的假名。
    说来也巧，一天，遂宁市公安局的一位同志，无意中从当地报纸上看到一则“寻人启事”，所寻之人许成华体貌特征与张晓英十分相似。通过查访终于证实这个冒名张晓英的小保姆正是许成华。1989年11月27日，许成华在遂宁市露面，被当地公安机关查获。
    11月29日，朝阳公安分局刑警唐铁民、姚小梅、刘海涛直下遂宁解救被拐卖的小志涛。
    三位刑警一到遂宁，连夜提审案犯。经过审讯，许成华承认了拐走小志涛的犯罪事实，并交待了小志涛被拐卖在河南安阳一个女教师家的情况。原来，许成华带着小志涛乘火车到河南安阳后，她谎称孩子是她哥哥的，嫂嫂死了，哥哥也意外伤残，无力抚养，托她卖掉孩子。一位不能生育的中年妇女，把她和小志涛带到家里，第二天，许成华到中年妇女家取钱的途中路过一个派出所，做贼心虚的许成华误为事情败露，没顾上要钱，就悄悄溜走了。她只记得买主有个10岁左右的女孩叫孔阳，住处附近有个水电派出所。
    这一信息很快传到北京后，朝阳公安分局当即决定，增派刑警队副队长魏金祥先行到安阳，查找那位中年妇女，同时电令唐铁民3人带着案犯到安阳会合。
    民警押着案犯上了一辆出租汽车，几经周折找到中年妇女的住处。
  原来，买主是一位女教师，她收养了小志涛后，给他改名叫杨光，半年多来教他背诗识字，关怀倍至，经侦察员耐心说服，女教师含着眼泪交出了孩子。
    在返京的路上，侦察员们像父母一样地关怀小志涛。临近北京时，还特意给小志涛洗了脸，剪了指甲，换上新衣服。
