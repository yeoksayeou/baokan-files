It was officially approved by the State Council in 1988 as the first new technology product development zone in China. The zone currently has 831 new technology enterprises, engaged in scientific research, development, production, and sales in dozens of industries such as electronic information technology, biomedical engineering, new materials, new energy and energy conservation, optoelectronic integration, laser applications, and space technology, forming a group of new technology enterprises with multiple disciplines and categories. Over the past year, the zone has made beneficial explorations in converting scientific and technological achievements into commercial products.

	Lei Jieqiong said at the meeting that the experimental and practical work of the development zone is of great significance for promoting the development of science and technology and for economic and technological system reforms.

	Lei Jieqiong hopes that Minjindang and the New Technology Development Zone will establish more connections and cooperate in certain areas. She said, "We can work together from different angles to promote the integration of science and technology with production and to promote the modernization of socialist construction."
