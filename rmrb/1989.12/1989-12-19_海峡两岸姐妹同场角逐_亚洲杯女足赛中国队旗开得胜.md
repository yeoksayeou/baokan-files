The seventh edition of the Asian Cup Women's Football Tournament kicked off tonight at the Hong Kong Government Stadium. The Chinese team won their opening match, defeating the Chinese Taipei team 1:0 in the group stage. The opponent, however, was once an undefeated team in Asia.

Tonight marked the first time that women's football teams from both sides of the Taiwan Strait have competed against each other in an official championship. Both teams are top-tier in Asia. The Chinese team is the defending champion, while the Chinese Taipei team did not participate in the previous edition. Women's football is a strong suit in Taiwan's sports scene, having won the Asian Cup in the second, third, and fourth editions consecutively. Both teams are considered strong contenders for the title by local football fans.

The Chinese team had clear offensive intentions, advancing towards the goal area multiple times in the first half. The Chinese Taipei team, on the other hand, was mostly on the defensive, rarely posing a significant threat to the Chinese goalkeeper. The Chinese team's number 7, Wu Wei Ying, who was heavily marked by the opponent, made several attempts from the right side to approach the goal area. Within 10 minutes, she made four diagonal attacks, but due to tight marking, the striker did not have time to coordinate, and no "air bomb" was formed. By the 30th minute, Wu Wei Ying managed to position herself appropriately, leaping to head the ball, catching the opponent's goalkeeper off guard due to the close distance, and the ball found the net. The Chinese team's morale soared, and soon after, Wu Wei Ying had another shot on goal, but it hit the post and bounced back.

In the second half, the Chinese team substituted number 15, Wei Hai Ying, for Wu Wei Ying. Despite frequent attacks, the opponent's defense held firm, and no more goals were scored.

Chinese team coach Shang Rui Hua stated that this match had a bit of a scouting nature, and both teams held back some of their strength. He believed the Chinese team's performance was worth 70 points, and if they could overcome passing errors, they could play even better. The Chinese Taipei team's strength lies in their footwork and individual skills, but they are inferior in terms of physique, speed, and stamina compared to the Chinese team. The Chinese Taipei team's strength in small-range combinations was nullified by the Chinese team's long passes and quick attacks.

In this edition of the Asian Cup, the teams are first divided into two groups for a single round-robin tournament. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals to compete for the championship.

Tonight, in the other group, the Hong Kong team defeated the Nepal team 3:0.

    海峡两岸姐妹同场角逐
    亚洲杯女足赛中国队旗开得胜
    本报香港12月18日电　记者连锦添报道：第七届亚洲杯女子足球赛今晚在香港政府大球场开锣。中国队旗开得胜，在分组赛中以1∶0战胜中国台北队，而对手曾是打遍亚洲无敌手的一支队伍。
    今晚是海峡两岸女足首次在正式锦标赛中碰头。双方同属亚洲一流劲旅。中国队是上届冠军，当时中国台北队未参赛。女子足球属台湾体坛一张王牌，曾在第二、三、四届亚洲杯赛接连夺魁。两队皆被此间球迷视为卫冕大热门。
    中国队进攻意图明显，在上半场十几次兵临城下，接近禁区或在内角逐。中国台北队通盘上处于守势，极少对大陆守门员构成惊心威胁。被对手视为重点防守对象的中国队7号吴伟英，几次从右边带球逼近禁区，10分钟内4次从斜线进攻，因对方盯得紧，中锋未来得及配合，没有形成“空中炸弹”。至30分钟时，吴伟英争取适当的位置，侧身跳起以头顶球，因距离较近，打得对方守门员措手不及，球入网底。一时中国队士气大振，不久吴伟英再临门一脚，可惜击中门框弹回。
    下半场中国队由15号韦海英替下吴伟英，虽频频进攻，因对方具有一定防守实力，一直未再得分。
    中国队教练商瑞华表示，这场比赛有点摸底性质，双方都保有一些实力。他认为中国队表现只可打70分，如克服传球失误可以打得更精采。中国台北队特点是脚法细腻，个人技术好，但身材、速度、体力上不如我队。中国台北队擅长的小范围配合，在中国队长传急攻面前无从发挥。
    本届亚洲杯赛先分两小组单循环角逐，各组积分最高两队晋升四强，争夺冠军。
    今晚，另一组的香港队以3∶0大胜尼泊尔队。
