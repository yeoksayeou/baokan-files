Jinan First Machine Tool Factory has bravely taken over the international market, with machine tool exports exceeding one thousand US dollars. Vice Premier Zhou Jia Hua and relevant departments sent congratulatory messages.

People's Daily, Jinan, December 9th - Vice Premier Zhou Jia Hua, the State Council's Office for the Export of Machinery and Electrical Products, and the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics today sent a congratulatory message to Jinan First Machine Tool Factory, expressing their warm congratulations on the factory's overcoming economic difficulties and achieving a breakthrough in exports of high-precision machine tools to developed capitalist countries, amounting to over one thousand US dollars this year.

Jinan First Machine Tool Factory is a key enterprise in China's machine tool manufacturing industry, producing a range of products including ordinary, precision, high-precision, digital display, and numerically controlled lathes, as well as machining centers, totaling eleven series and eighty varieties. At the beginning of this year, they correctly analyzed the situation where the compression of construction investment would inevitably lead to changes in the machine tool market. They decided on the production and operational strategy of "giving up part of the domestic market, expanding the occupation of the international market, and achieving one thousand US dollars in export earnings this year." As of today, the factory has shipped 1,432 machine tools for export this year, earning 1,020 US dollars, an increase of 2.4 times over last year.

The congratulatory message stated that in accordance with the strategic decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to expand the export of machinery and electrical products, you have overcome various difficulties in funds, materials, energy, transportation, and the impact of the turmoil, insisting on honoring contracts and maintaining credibility. With high-quality products, you have seized the international market and made a contribution to expanding exports during the period of rectification and adjustment. The message hopes that the factory will continue to make efforts and strive to make greater contributions to achieving a steady and continuous increase in foreign trade exports next year.

    本报济南十二月九日电　国务委员邹家华、国务院机电产品出口办公室和机械电子工业部今天致电济南第一机床厂，对该厂克服经济困难、今年实现对发达资本主义国家出口高精密机床突破一千万美元表示热烈祝贺。
    济南第一机床厂是我国机床制造行业的骨干企业，产品包括普通、精密、高精度、数显、数控车床和加工中心等十一个系列、八十个品种。今年年初，他们正确分析压缩基建投资必然引起机床市场变化的形势，确定了“让出部分国内市场，扩大占领国际市场，全年出口创汇一千万美元”的生产经营决策。截至今日，今年已发运出口机床一千四百三十二台，创汇额达一千零二万美元，比去年增长了二点四倍。
    贺电中说，按照党中央、国务院关于扩大机电产品出口的战略决策，你们千方百计克服资金、材料、能源、运输等各种困难和动乱造成的影响，坚持重合同、守信誉，以优质产品挤占国际市场，为在治理整顿期间扩大出口作出了贡献。贺电希望该厂再接再厉，继续努力，为争取明年外贸出口持续稳定地增长做出更大的贡献。　（张继东）
