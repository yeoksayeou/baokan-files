Two years ago, the West German youth Mathias Rust flew a plane into Moscow's Red Square. Recently, he was arrested by the police for stabbing someone with a knife.

According to reports, the 21-year-old Rust is currently serving his compulsory community service at a Red Cross hospital in Hamburg. On the afternoon of November 23, after finishing work, he went to the changing room with an 18-year-old female trainee nurse to change clothes. When he attempted to kiss the nurse, she refused, and in a fit of anger, he stabbed her twice in the lower abdomen, causing serious injury. After three hours of emergency treatment, the nurse was out of danger. Rust fled the scene by car and later called the police to turn himself in. In May 1987, he landed his plane in Red Square. The Soviet Union sentenced him to four years of hard labor, but after many prominent figures in West Germany pleaded on his behalf, the Soviet Union pardoned him in August of last year.

Since returning to his country, Rust has been in the spotlight. He has given talks in the Netherlands and sold the rights to his story to the West German magazine *Stern*, making a considerable amount of money, which can be described as "fame and fortune."

Rust's stunt two years ago was a super prank, but now he has become a criminal, which is truly a tragedy.

    昔日驾机闯祸　今朝持刀伤人
    鲁斯特又犯新罪
    两年前驾驶飞机闯入莫斯科红场的西德青年马蒂西斯·鲁斯特，最近又因持刀伤人而被警方逮捕。
    据报道，现年21岁的鲁斯特目前在汉堡一家红十字医院服民役。11月23日下午3时，他下班后与一名18岁的女见习护士同去更衣室换衣服时，企图与该护士接吻，遭到拒绝后恼羞成怒，竟然操刀在她下腹部刺了两刀，造成重伤。经过3小时抢救，女护士才脱离危险。鲁斯特作案后驾车而逃，而后才打电话向警方自首。1987年5月他驾机降落在红场上。苏联判了他4年劳改，在西德许多政要为他求情的情况下，苏联于去年8月赦免了他。
    鲁斯特回国后出了一阵子风头，他曾到荷兰作报告，还把他这段经历的报道权卖给西德《明星》周刊，捞了一笔钱，可谓“名利双收”。
    鲁斯特两年前制造了超级恶作剧，而今又因刑事犯罪成了新闻人物，这不能不说是个悲剧。（江建国）
