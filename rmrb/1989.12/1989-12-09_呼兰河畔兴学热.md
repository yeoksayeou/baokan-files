The Hulan River, this magical black land, is renowned for nurturing the female writer Xiao Hong.

This spring, a call from this place once shook the capital. The photograph of students from a certain school in Hulan attending classes in a farmer's home, published on the front page of the People's Daily on March 27, became a hot topic at the ongoing Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress.

A miracle happened here.

Under the leadership of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee and the Hulan County Party Committee, the 600,000 people of Hulan County embarked on an unprecedented campaign to raise funds for education. In just half a year, they built 66 new school buildings on the disaster-stricken black land.

But the harvest was not just these 66 schools.

Starting from Hardship

Three consecutive years of heavy rain, hail, and tornadoes had destroyed dozens of primary and secondary schools across the county. By this spring, the total area of dilapidated school buildings had reached over 27,000 square meters. Students from 109 classes were scattered in village offices, farmers' homes, warehouses, and even chicken coops for their lessons.

The Xubao Township Xiaodezi Primary School was reduced to a pile of yellow earth, and the school became a ruin. In the makeshift classroom in a farmer's home, the desks and benches made of broken wooden planks were uneven. In some villages, children had no place to study. Those with means sent their children to relatives in other places, while others simply let their children become "little merchants." The primary school in Lianhua Township's Lixian Village had not enrolled a single student for three consecutive years. Teachers were so desperate that they shed tears, and parents were so worried that they stamped their feet in frustration.

However, solving educational difficulties requires money. The already tight financial situation in Hulan County was further strained by the consecutive disasters, leaving the county with virtually no funds. The county had to seek help from the superior authorities. But Harbin City was also heavily burdened. Despite the financial strain, the municipal government invested over 40 million yuan in education over three years, with 9 million yuan allocated to Hulan and other counties. Yet, this was still like a drop in the bucket.

The leaders of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, Municipal People's Congress, and Municipal Government conducted nine inspections in Hulan, proposing to address the issue of dilapidated school buildings in Hulan's primary and secondary schools with the spirit of disaster relief. They aimed to rebuild the 57 most difficult schools within the year, ensuring they could withstand strong winds, heavy rains, and remain stable for 50 years. Mayor Gong Benyuan suggested that the municipal government could break the rules and use emergency funds to support Hulan's educational cause. However, he also emphasized the need to follow the mass line, establish the idea of the whole people running education, and explore multiple channels to solve educational difficulties.

The budget estimated that rebuilding 57 primary and secondary school buildings would require 6.5 million yuan. The Harbin Municipal Government allocated 3.25 million yuan from the mayor's reserve fund, which had never been used in the first half of the year, to Hulan.

A Wave of Educational Enthusiasm

As the ice on the Hulan River thawed, a wave of enthusiasm for education surged. County leaders took the lead by each donating 200 yuan, and various committees, bureaus, and offices quickly followed suit. The grain system raised 36,100 yuan in one day;

The officials of Lianhua Township's Fuyou Village, unable to raise funds immediately, sold the village committee office, choosing to borrow a place to work in order to support education;

The director of the county dairy factory, Yu Chunzhi, led by donating 500 yuan, and the deputy directors each donated 200 yuan. The entire factory's staff formed a long line to donate enthusiastically, raising 250,000 yuan in one day;

Individual poultry farmer Yang Qin, upon hearing the news, immediately donated all the 500,000 yuan he could gather;

Even more commendable was that students from a workers' children's school in Wuhan donated their pocket money, penny by penny, to Hulan County...

By May, Hulan County had raised 4.09 million yuan for collective education funding. Adding the municipal subsidies and some funds raised by townships and towns outside the plan, the total reached nearly 8 million yuan! These funds were filled with so much effort and hope!

The most magnificent and spectacular project in Hulan County's history began.

The construction of new school buildings across the county adopted a unified design plan, quality standards, and inspection and acceptance methods, establishing a three-level quality organization at the county, township (town), and village levels. Dozens of villages successively echoed with the sounds of rammed earth construction, piles of steel bars, cement, and high-quality timber urgently transported from the forest area. County leaders and professional staff often worked through the night, braving wind and rain to inspect the construction sites. Even if a single brick was not aligned or a window was not securely installed, they would not hesitate to demolish and rebuild.

Sixty-six school buildings rose from the ground.

In the autumn, the harvest season arrived.

Hulan County not only completed the 56 planned school buildings on time (originally planned for 57, with one kindergarten being a cross-year project), but several townships also raised an additional 600,000 yuan to build 10 more schools. "The most beautiful building is the school," became a reality in Hulan.

The villagers of Lianhua Township's Majia Village in Lixian Township celebrated like it was a festival on the first day of school. They were fortunate that their children's predicament of studying in various places had ended. Every family dressed their children neatly, in new clothes, and led them to school early. When the school bell rang, the parents still did not leave. Listening to the clear reading voices, the elderly farmers were so moved that their eyes welled up with tears. The beautiful school building in Xiaodezi Primary School was not yet completed when more than 60 students who had been studying in other townships or had dropped out to do business were brought back by their parents, fearing they might miss the first class in the new classroom. The dropout rate in Hulan County's primary and secondary schools had dropped from 6% to below 3%.

These 66 beautiful schools gave the common people great peace of mind. They instructed their children not to scribble or damage the school property, not to break windows or kick doors. They tightly confined their chickens, ducks, geese, and dogs, fearing they might soil the school. The Fuyou Village assigned a special person to guard the school and had a carpenter make a delicate book corner and a hygiene corner. The Xiaode Village Committee clearly stipulated six regulations for managing the new school.

The history of schools turning into dilapidated buildings should not be repeated. This was the common wish of the entire county.

The 66 schools not only meant that children had a place to study again, but they also promoted the formation of a respect-for-teachers culture, increasing the weight of the Party and government in the hearts of the people.

The dramatic changes in Hulan's education also shook the hearts of every teacher. In the face of adversity, many teachers had considered changing careers. The principal of Xiaodezi Village had repeatedly sought the township leaders: "I would rather go to the fields and wield a hoe than stay here. How can I teach children in this environment?" With the completion of one new school building after another, the teachers changed: Why leave? Hurry up and prepare lessons. In the future, it's our turn. We must achieve results that match the beautiful buildings to repay the kindness of the villagers!

The 66 schools echoed with joyous songs and the sound of clear reading...

    呼兰河畔兴学热
    赵连城　单宏
    呼兰河畔，这片神奇的黑土地，因孕育了女作家萧红而闻名遐迩。
    今年春天，从这里发出的呼号，曾惊动了首都。《人民日报》在3月27日一版刊载的呼兰某校学生在农户家中上课的照片，一时成为正在召开的全国七届人大二次会议的热门话题。
    奇迹就发生在这里。
    呼兰县60万人民在哈尔滨市委和呼兰县委的领导下，干起了一场前所未有的捐资助学事业。仅用半年时间，就在灾后的黑土地上建起了66所崭新的校舍。
    而收获的，却不止这66所学校。
    从艰难中起步
    连续3年的大雨、冰雹、龙卷风，吞噬了全县几十所中小学。到今年春天，全县学校危倒房总数已达2.7万多平方米，有109个班的学生分散在村办公室、农户住屋、仓库，甚至鸡舍里上课。
    许堡乡小得子小学只剩下一堆黄土，学校成了废墟。在做临时教室的农户家中，破木板拼成的两排桌凳高低不平。有的村里，孩子们根本无处就学。于是，有办法的就把孩子送到外地亲属处就学，有的干脆放任孩子去做“小商人”。莲花乡李宪屯的小学连续3年没招过学生了，教师们急得掉眼泪，家长们愁得直跺脚。
    然而，解决教育困难需要钱。本来财政就很紧的呼兰县，由于连年受灾，财力已到了囊空如洗的地步，县里不得不向上级主管市求援了。但哈尔滨市的负担也够重的，市政府在资金紧张的情况下，3年向教育投资4000多万元，单向呼兰等县市就投入900多万元。但仍如杯水车薪。
    哈尔滨市委、市人大和市政府的领导9次到呼兰考察，提出要以抢险救灾的精神解决呼兰中小学危倒房，年内重建最困难的57所校舍，并且要达到抗大风、抗暴雨、能稳固50年的水平。市长宫本言建议：市政府可打破常规，动用非常资金，支援呼兰教育事业。但同时他又指出：要走群众路线，树立全民办教育的思想，开辟多种渠道解决教育困难。
    经预算，重建57所中小学校舍需要650万元。哈尔滨市政府在上半年从未动用过的市长预备金里拿出325万元给呼兰。
    集资办学出成果
    尚有3尺冰冻的呼兰河畔涌起一股重教兴学的热流：县领导首先每人捐款200元，各委、部、办、局也迅速行动起来，粮食系统一天就集资36100元；
    莲花乡富有村干部一时筹措不出资金，便把村委会办公室卖掉，宁肯借地方办公，也要支持教育；
    县乳品厂于春志厂长带头捐500元，副厂长各捐200元，全厂职工排成长队踊跃捐献，一天就集资2.5万元；
    个体养鸡户杨勤听到消息后，当即把手头所有能凑到的5万元资金全都送到县政府；
    更可贵的是，武汉市一家职工子弟小学的学生把自己的零花钱1分1分地集在一起，寄到呼兰县……
    到5月份，呼兰县集资办共收到捐款409万元，加上市里补助和一些乡镇计划外筹集的资金，已达到近800万元！这些钱，饱含了多少心血、多少期待啊！
    呼兰县有史以来最宏伟、最壮观的工程开始了。
    全县新建校舍采取统一设计图纸、统一质量标准、统一检查验收的办法，建立了县、乡（镇）、村3级工程质量组织。几十个村相继响起了砸夯声，堆满了钢筋、水泥和从林区紧急运来的上好木料。县领导和专职工作人员常常披星戴月、顶风冒雨到工地检查，哪怕有一块砖没垒齐、一扇窗户没安牢，都毫不客气地推倒重来。
    六十六座校舍拔地而起
    仲秋，收获的季节来到了。
    呼兰县不仅把计划内的56所校舍按期完工（原计划57所，其中一幼儿园为跨年度工程），几个乡还超计划集资60万元，又建起10所学校。“最漂亮的房子是学校”，在呼兰成为现实。
    莲花乡马家村李宪屯的村民们在开学这天像过节一样，他们庆幸自己的孩子结束了四处投学的困境。家家都把孩子梳洗得干干净净，穿上新衣，早早领到学校。上课铃响了，家长们仍不离去。听着朗朗的读书声，上了年纪的庄户人激动得眼泪汪汪。小得子小学那座漂亮的校舍还没最后完工时，60多个到外乡学习或停学跑买卖的学生就都被家长找回来，生怕耽误了在新教室上第一节课。呼兰县中小学流失率已由6％降到3％以下。
    这66所漂亮的学校让老百姓大大地放了心。他们嘱咐自己的孩子不能在学校乱涂乱画，不许打碎玻璃、踢坏门。他们把自家的鸡、鸭、鹅、狗牢牢圈住，生怕弄脏了学校。富有村派专人给学校打更，还让木匠做了精巧的图书角和卫生角。小得村委会明确订出6条管理新学校的规定。
    学校变危房的历史再不能重演了。这是全县人的共同心愿。
    66所学校不仅意味着孩子们又有了读书的地方，它还促成了尊师重教风尚的形成，加重了党和政府在群众心中的分量。
    呼兰教育的巨变，也震撼了每一位教师的心灵。在困境中，曾有不少教师要改行，小得子村的校长几次找乡领导：“我宁可下屯撸锄杠，也不在这儿干了，这环境还怎么教孩子念书？”。随着一所所新校舍的建成，老师们变了：还走什么，抓紧时间备课吧，以后该看咱们的了。得拿出与那漂亮房子相称的成绩来，才对得起乡亲父老啊！
    66所学校传出欢歌笑语，传出朗朗读书声……
