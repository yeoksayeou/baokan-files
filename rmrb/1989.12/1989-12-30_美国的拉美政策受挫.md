The U.S. invasion of Panama has been condemned by the vast majority of Latin American countries, which was something President Bush did not fully anticipate. Although General Noriega has sought refuge in the Vatican's embassy in Panama, the Panama crisis is far from over. For many Latin American countries, they have not changed their stance and attitude of opposing the U.S. invasion of Panama.

On the day of the U.S. invasion of Panama, President Bush personally called Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and a few other influential countries in Latin America to seek their "understanding and support" for the U.S. action. However, in all of Latin America, only the government of El Salvador expressed support for the U.S. invasion of Panama. Governments, parliaments, ruling parties, opposition parties, and media outlets in various Latin American countries have all condemned the U.S. act of aggression. They believe that the U.S. is "reviving the big stick policy that Latin American countries have long hated and despised"; any invasion of a sovereign Latin American country is an aggression against the entire region. The Organization of American States passed a resolution condemning the U.S. aggression with 20 votes in favor, 6 abstentions, and 1 vote (the U.S.) against, demanding that the U.S. withdraw its troops from Panama immediately. This is the first time the U.S. has been in such an isolated position in the Organization of American States. Many Latin American countries have also expressed that they do not recognize the Endara government, which was installed by the U.S. Peruvian President Garcia even announced that he would refuse to attend the originally scheduled "anti-drug summit" with President Bush in Colombia until the U.S. withdraws from Panama.

Since President Bush took office, the U.S. has partially adjusted its policy towards Central America and Latin America. In dealing with relations with Latin American countries, especially on major issues such as debt, drugs, regional peace, and development, it has begun to adopt a more dialogic stance with Latin American countries. On the debt issue, it proposed the "Brady Plan" centered on debt reduction; on anti-drug efforts, it accepted the stance proposed by Latin American countries that "it is necessary to control the consumption of drugs that stimulates drug production," strengthening the anti-drug fight within the U.S. and supporting Latin American countries in their fight against drug production and trafficking groups. President Bush also, despite opposition from some people at home, attended the Summit of the Americas convened by Costa Rica; agreed to go to Colombia to attend the "anti-drug summit" with some South American leaders; promised to provide more aid to Latin American countries, etc. These gestures by the U.S. were aimed at improving relations with Latin American countries and thereby consolidating its political influence in Latin America, which had some effect. For a time, Panama, due to domestic political turmoil, was also quite isolated in Latin America and internationally. Moreover, domestic economic problems were becoming increasingly serious, which had a great impact on the psychology of the Panamanian people. Objectively, this to some extent pushed Panama to gradually restore its democratic process. But at this moment, the Bush administration brazenly sent troops to invade Panama. It seems that the U.S. government miscalculated, being overly optimistic about the situation. Six years after the U.S. invaded Grenada, it was gradually repairing its relations with Latin American countries, but it invaded Panama again, making Latin American countries feel that the change of administration in the White House did not change the strings, and Latin American countries were still in a position to be dealt with at will. The U.S. still insists on hegemony in handling contradictions and relations with Latin American countries. Peruvian President Garcia pointed out that the U.S. Latin American policy has "hit a dead end." The U.S. has not fundamentally changed its tradition of power politics with the changing times. In the future, it will be more difficult for the Bush administration to repair its relations with Latin American countries. The foreign minister of the new Panamanian government, Julio Linares, who was installed by the U.S. military, has already announced that Panama will still demand that the U.S. fulfill the "New Panama Canal Treaty" and transfer the sovereignty of the canal completely to Panama by December 31, 1999; the Panamanian government will not sign any agreement with a foreign country that aims to cede part of its territory and sovereignty. This is because, no matter who is in power in Panama, they cannot give up the flag of nationalism to reclaim the canal. The U.S. invasion of Panama has seriously damaged its efforts to improve relations with Latin American countries, which is a political price that the U.S. has to pay in addition to the military cost.

    美国的拉美政策受挫
    本报记者　郭伟成
    美国入侵巴拿马遭到绝大多数拉美国家的谴责，这是布什总统事先不曾完全估计到的。现在虽然诺列加将军已经到梵蒂冈驻巴拿马使馆要求避难，但是巴拿马危机并没有结束。对许多拉美国家来说，它们至今没有改变反对美国侵略巴拿马的立场与态度。
    美国入侵巴拿马的当天，布什总统曾亲自打电话向墨西哥、巴西、阿根廷等拉美几个有影响的大国打招呼，希望他们“理解与支持”美国的行动。但是，在整个拉丁美洲，只有萨尔瓦多政府表示支持美国入侵巴拿马。拉美各国政府、议会、执政党与反对党、舆论界纷纷谴责美国的侵略行为。认为美国“重操久为拉美国家痛恨与唾弃的大棒政策”；对任何一个拉美主权国家的入侵，都是对整个拉美的侵略。美洲国家组织以20票赞成、6票弃权、1票（美国）反对，通过决议谴责美国的侵略行为，要求美国立即从巴拿马撤军。这是美国第一次在美洲国家组织中处于这样孤立的地位。许多拉美国家还表示不承认由美国扶上宝座的恩达拉政府。秘鲁总统加西亚甚至宣布，他将拒绝与布什总统一起参加原定在哥伦比亚举行的“反毒高峰会议”，直到美国从巴拿马撤军。
    布什总统入主白宫以后，部分调整了美国对中美洲及拉丁美洲的政策。在处理与拉美国家关系，尤其是在债务、毒品，地区和平与发展等重大问题上，开始较多地采取同拉美国家对话的立场。在债务方面提出了以减债为中心的“布雷迪计划”；在反毒方面，接受了拉美国家提出的“必须控制毒品的消费对毒品生产造成的刺激”的立场，加强美国国内反毒品斗争，支持拉美国家与毒品生产、贩运集团作斗争。布什总统还不顾国内一些人的反对，出席哥斯达黎加倡议并召集的美洲首脑会议；答应前往哥伦比亚参加与部分南美国家首脑举行的“反毒高峰会议”；允诺给予拉美国家较多的援助，等等。美国作出的这些姿态，目的在于改善与拉美国家的关系，从而巩固它在拉美的政治影响，曾收到了一定的成效。一时，巴拿马由于国内政局混乱在拉美和国际上也显得比较孤立，加之国内经济问题日益严重，对巴拿马国民心理造成了很大的冲击，客观上，这在某种程度上推动着巴拿马逐渐恢复民主进程。但就在这个时候，布什政府悍然出兵入侵巴拿马。看来，美国政府是打错了算盘，过于乐观地估计了形势。美国出兵格林纳达6年后，正在逐步修复与拉美国家关系时，又入侵巴拿马，使拉美国家觉得，白宫易主，不更其弦，拉美国家仍然处于被任意处置的地位，美国在处理与拉美国家的矛盾与关系时，仍然坚持霸权主义。秘鲁总统加西亚指出，美国的拉美政策“走进了死胡同”。美国没有因为时代的变化而从根本上改变强权政治的传统，今后布什政府要修复与拉美国家的关系就更为困难。由美军扶植起来的巴拿马新政府外长胡利奥·利纳雷斯已经宣布，巴拿马仍将要求美国履行《美巴运河新条约》，在1999年12月31日把运河主权完全归还巴拿马；巴拿马政府不会与外国签订任何旨在出让部分领土及其主权的协议。这是因为，无论谁在巴拿马执政，都不能放弃收回运河这面民族主义的旗帜。美国入侵巴拿马，严重损害了它与拉美国家改善关系的努力，这是美国在付出军事代价的同时，也要付出的政治代价。
