Cyprus on the 29th lodged a strong protest with Israel over the interception of a Cypriot passenger ship by an Israeli warship on the 28th.

According to a report from the Cyprus News Agency on the evening of the 29th, Andreas Jacovides, Director of the Cyprus Foreign Ministry, summoned Israeli Ambassador to Nicosia, Lopez, to lodge the protest.

The report said that the passenger ship "Zeus-Ksenios," flying the Cypriot flag, was intercepted by an Israeli warship near the Lebanese territorial waters.

The ship was forced to enter an Israeli port, where Israeli soldiers detained two individuals believed to be Palestinians of Jordanian nationality. The ship was later released.

    塞浦路斯抗议以炮舰拦截客轮
    塞浦路斯二十九日就以色列一炮舰二十八日非法拦截塞浦路斯一客轮事件向以方提出强烈抗议。
    据塞浦路斯通讯社二十九日晚的消息说，塞浦路斯外交部办公厅主任安德烈亚斯·贾科维迪斯召见以色列驻尼科西亚大使洛佩斯时提出了上述抗议。
    报道说，飘扬着塞浦路斯国旗的客轮“宙斯—克塞尼奥斯”号在黎巴嫩海域附近遭到以色列炮舰的拦截。
    该客轮被迫驶进以色列一港口，在那里以色列军人扣留了两名据信属约旦国籍的巴勒斯坦人。该客轮后来被释放。
