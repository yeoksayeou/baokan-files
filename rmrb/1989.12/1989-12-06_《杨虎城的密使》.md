The PLA writer Li Ling's "Yang Huicheng's Secret Envoy" has recently been published by the PLA Press. The book depicts the underground Communist Party member Wu Zhiping, who, as Yang Huicheng's special envoy, traveled to the northern line of the Sichuan-Shanxi Soviet area in 1933 to establish contact with the Red Army. He successfully completed tasks such as establishing communication lines, escorting cadres, purchasing telecommunications equipment, medicines, and newspapers. The late Red Army general Fu Zhong, who received Wu Zhiping, wrote a preface stating: During the revolutionary war years, many outstanding Communist Party members braved hardships and dangers, facing imprisonment and beheading, carrying out secret missions such as military intelligence, communications, and intelligence. They made immortal contributions to the victory of the revolution and the liberation of the people.
