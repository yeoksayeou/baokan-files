Casual Talk About Golf
By Chén Fēng Wén, illustration by Fēng Xióng

Golf is more of a game than a sport, as it involves relatively little physical exertion, making it suitable for middle-aged and elderly individuals. Unlike running or playing team sports, which are more suitable for the young and involve intense competition and high physical demands, playing golf is a gentle and leisurely activity that is relaxing and enjoyable.

Another important condition is that golf requires a large, well-maintained grassy area, and participants need to have a set of golf clubs and various accessories. This makes it difficult for golf to become a popular sport, as the cost of acquiring these items is beyond the reach of ordinary people. In Western countries, generally only those in the middle class and above can afford to play this game. A basic set of golf clubs costs around five hundred dollars. Even if public servants and workers save up to buy the clubs, they rarely have the leisure to go to the golf course in the suburbs to play. Therefore, some people say that golf is a sport for the nobility and not a true sport. The Olympics have never included it as a competitive event.

Perhaps because of the relatively high standard of living in America, it is said that there are over twenty million people who enjoy playing golf. Of course, most of them are not professional players or members of golf clubs, but rather casual enthusiasts who occasionally play on informal courses to exercise. They enjoy this game because it is not as physically demanding as sports like American football, which can leave one exhausted and drenched in sweat. Instead, golf is a comfortable and pleasant outdoor activity.

There are thousands of golf clubs in the United States, all with well-maintained grassy courses. The primary requirement for club membership is having both money and time, with money being the most important. Therefore, being a member of a golf club not only signifies a unique status but also implies generous spending. Golf clubs are usually located on the outskirts of cities and feature high-end hotels and restaurants, with top-notch facilities and service standards. Members pay a high annual fee to enjoy various pleasures during short vacations. Wealthy businessmen can also use the opportunity to discuss and finalize deals while playing golf or enjoying a drink. Thus, during the spring and autumn seasons, golf clubs become popular gathering spots for the elite, always bustling with activity. Statistics show that the total annual revenue of all golf clubs in the United States is approximately eighty billion dollars. Including the revenue from various services related to golf, the annual total exceeds two hundred billion dollars.

In recent years, the upper class in Western European countries has also taken up this elegant game. According to a new survey by the British sports market, there are currently five million golf enthusiasts in Europe, with three million of them being British. The French are also very enthusiastic, with 115 golf courses already built or under construction. Some foreign businessmen have opened luxurious golf clubs in Scotland. A Canadian businessman plans to invite one thousand "distinguished individuals" as members, each requiring a membership fee of 150,000 pounds in securities. The phrase "golf is a sport for the nobility" seems quite reasonable.

    闲话高尔夫
    陈封文　封雄图
    高尔夫球与其说是一种体育项目，毋宁说是一种游戏，因为打这种球的运动量不很大或很不大，适合中老年人的体力。不像赛跑或打球那些只适合青年的消耗体力大而且竞争较激烈的体育运动，玩高尔夫球是相当温文尔雅，不紧不慢，轻松惬意的。
    还有一个重要的条件，就是打高尔夫球必须有面积较大绿草如茵的场地，参加游戏的人还要自备一套得心应手的击球棒以及若干附加配备。这就使它不能成为大众化的体育运动，因为购办这套东西不是凡夫俗子力所能及的。西方国家一般也都是中产以上阶层人士才玩得起这种球戏。一套最普通的球棒售价在五百美元左右，靠工资吃饭的公务员和工人即或攒钱买了球棒，也难得有闲情逸志跑到郊区球场去打高尔夫。因此有人说打高尔夫是贵族的体育游戏，算不得什么体育运动。奥运会也一直没有把它列为竞赛项目。
    也许是由于美国人平均生活水平较高的原因，据说喜欢打高尔夫球的人已超过两千万。当然他们绝大多数不是职业球员或高尔夫俱乐部的会员，而只是偶尔在非正规场地上活动活动筋骨的“爱好者”。他们有此爱好，是因为这种球戏不像打橄榄球之类的体育运动那样弄得精疲力尽，大汗淋漓，而是一种舒适愉快的户外肌肉活动。
    美国有几千个高尔夫俱乐部，都拥有正规的草坪球场，俱乐部会员的首要条件是既有钱又有闲，当然有钱是第一位的。因此作为高尔夫俱乐部的会员不但显示他们的身份与众不同，而且花钱也必然慷慨大方。
    高尔夫俱乐部大都在城市近郊，设有高级旅馆和餐厅，场地设施和服务标准都是第一流的，所以会员每年要交纳相当高的会费，可享受短期度假的种种乐趣。富商巨贾还可以趁打高尔夫球的间隙，或在小憩时对饮威士忌之际谈妥几笔生意。所以在春暖花开和金风送爽之季，高尔夫俱乐部也是上层人物的交际场所，总是高朋满座、生意兴隆。据统计全美国高尔夫俱乐部每年的总营业额约为八十亿美元，加上许多与高尔夫球有关的服务行业的营业金额，每年则不下二百亿美元。
    西欧国家的上层人士近年来也兴起了这种高雅的球戏。据英国体育市场调查新的统计，欧洲现有五百万个高尔夫球爱好者，其中三百万是英国人。法国人的热情也很高，已建成或正建设的高尔夫球场有一百一十五个。有些外国商人已在苏格兰开办豪华的高尔夫俱乐部。一位加拿大商人开设的俱乐部计划邀请一千位“高尚人士”作为会员，每人须交价值一点五万英镑的有价证券作为入会费。“高尔夫球是贵族的体育游戏”这句话，看来不无道理。（附图片）
    “董事长先生，您打球的眼力大概也许似乎有些不如做股票投机生意。”
