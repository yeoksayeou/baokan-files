Recently, the Colombian Congress, while discussing the issue of holding a public referendum next year to amend the constitution, stirred up a political whirlwind over the extradition issue. This led to a standoff between the ruling authorities and the Congress, with the leaders of the ruling Liberal Party, former President Turbay, and the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Pastrana, both resigning from their party positions. The issue of the public referendum next year has also been temporarily shelved.

The Colombian Congress began debating the amendment of the constitution and the public referendum to be held next year for this purpose at the beginning of this month. Amending the constitution is an important part of the peace agreement between the Barco government and the "April 19" guerrilla movement, and it is a necessary step to legalize this guerrilla force and allow it to enter the Congress as a legitimate political force. The main contents of the constitutional amendments include establishing a constitutional assembly, setting up a vice president, establishing a referendum system, and amending the election law, all of which need to be put to a public vote next January.

Unexpectedly, just before the Congress was about to start the debate, a group of deputies suddenly proposed a motion to include the extradition issue in the public referendum. Extradition is currently the most sensitive issue in Colombia's anti-drug fight. Since President Barco announced the resumption of the extradition agreement between Colombia and the United States on August 18 this year, this measure has become a powerful weapon in the fight against major drug traffickers. Drug cartels view it as a thorn in their side and have created numerous terrorist incidents to eliminate this measure. In the past four months, the government has extradited 10 drug criminals to the United States, while drug cartels have carried out more than 260 bombings and assassinations, including a major incident in mid-December where 62 people were killed and nearly a thousand injured. The arrogance of the drug cartels has made the extradition issue a taboo topic in public. The practice of tying the extradition issue to the constitutional amendment issue immediately drew strong opposition from the government. However, the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives still passed this bill by a overwhelming majority. Notably, a significant number of deputies from the ruling Liberal Party also voted in favor. Some members of the Liberal Party even criticized the government for being too inflexible on the extradition issue, making mistakes that led to a confrontation with Congress, and further demanded that President Barco resign.

President Barco, in an attempt to prevent the Senate from also passing this bill, held emergency consultations with the leaders of the two major parties, pointing out that if a public referendum were held on the extradition issue, it would only lead to new terrorist activities. Under these circumstances, the people would not be able to freely express their will. The drug cartels threatened that if the Senate excluded the extradition issue from the public referendum, they would retaliate. Under this situation, the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the Senate passed a resolution to hold a public referendum on the extradition issue, but only separated this issue from the constitutional amendment issue, and postponed the public referendum on the extradition issue to September next year after the end of Barco's term. Due to the repeated disregard of party leaders' opinions by deputies from both parties, Turbay and Pastrana had no choice but to resign from their respective party positions, creating an unprecedented crisis in Colombia's political situation.

The political turmoil in Colombia caused by the extradition issue further demonstrates the Colombian government's resolute attitude towards the anti-drug issue, indicating that the anti-drug fight is extremely complex and arduous.

    引渡问题引起的政治漩涡
    本报记者　朱满庭
    最近，哥伦比亚国会在讨论为修改宪法而于明年举行公民投票问题时，因引渡问题引起一场政治漩涡，形成了执政当局与国会的对峙，执政的自由党领袖、前总统图尔瓦伊和反对党保守党的领袖帕斯特拉纳为此双双辞去党内职务，明年的公民投票问题也被暂时搁置起来。
    哥伦比亚国会本月初开始就修改宪法和明年为此而举行的公民投票问题进行辩论。修改宪法是巴尔科政府与游击队“四·一九”运动达成和平协议的重要内容，也是使这支游击队正式合法化，能作为一支合法政治力量进入国会的必要步骤。宪法的修改内容主要是建立修宪大会、设立副总统，设立公民投票制、修改选举法等，这几项重大修改均需付诸明年1月的公民表决。
    不料，就在国会即将开始辩论前，一批议员突然提出一项动议，要求在公民投票中加进关于引渡问题的内容。而引渡是当前哥伦比亚反毒品斗争中最敏感的一个问题。自今年8月18日巴尔科总统宣布恢复执行哥伦比亚与美国之间引渡协议后，这一措施成为打击重大贩毒分子的有力武器，被贩毒集团视为眼中钉，他们为打掉这一措施制造了大量恐怖事件。近4个月，政府向美国引渡了10名毒犯，贩毒集团则制造了260多起爆炸和暗杀事件，其中包括12月上旬一次爆炸中造成62人死亡、近千人受伤的大惨案。贩毒集团的嚣张气焰使引渡问题在公开场合成为人们最忌讳谈论的问题。把引渡问题与宪法修改问题绑在一起的做法，立即遭到政府的强烈反对。但众院的宪法事务委员会还是以压倒多数通过了这一议案。值得注意的是，执政的自由党内相当多的议员也投了赞成票。自由党一些人甚至指责政府在引渡问题上过于固执，犯了错误，导致了与国会的对立，进而要求巴尔科总统辞职。
    巴尔科总统为阻止参议院也通过这个议案，与两大政党领袖进行紧急磋商，指出如果就引渡问题进行公民投票，只能引起新的恐怖活动，在这种情况下，人民无法自由地表示其意志。贩毒集团则威胁说，如果参议院把引渡问题排除在公民投票之外，就要进行报复。在此形势下，参议院的宪法事务委员会通过了就引渡问题进行公民投票的决议，只是将这个问题与宪法修改问题分开，引渡问题的公民投票推迟到明年9月巴尔科政府任期结束后举行。由于两党议员一再不听从党内领袖的意见，参院宪法事务委员会表决后，图尔瓦伊和帕斯特拉纳只好辞去他们各自在党内的职务，形成哥伦比亚政局中前所未有的危机。
    引渡问题造成的哥伦比亚政局的这场风波，进一步表明了哥伦比亚政府在反毒品问题上的坚决态度，说明反毒品斗争是极其复杂、艰巨的。　（本报波哥大电）
