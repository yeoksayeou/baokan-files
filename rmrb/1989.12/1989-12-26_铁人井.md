Beyond the city adorned with flowers,
I come to read you,
With the eyes of a younger generation,
On the path I took to come here,
The steel wheels of the train
Once struck my rusted soul.
I was lured by your allure,
Was it for the birth of a poem?
The door of the well house,
Your silhouette is carved in the wood grain.
The chest of the mud pool,
Your blood flows with a chime.
The desolate walls of the earthen hut,
Record your snores after labor.
Even the silent duty room,
The weathered oil pool,
Are all witnesses to the spirit of the Iron Man.
Old Iron Man,
Do you still gnaw on frozen steamed buns
On nights with strong winds?
Wearing that old sheepskin coat,
Do you go out to inspect the wells?
Iron Man Well is China,
Even while sleeping,
It keeps its eyes wide open.

    铁人井
    李英杰
    越过鲜花簇拥的城市
    我来读你
    睁着一双后辈人的眼睛
    在我来时的路上
    那钢铁的车轮
    曾敲打我生锈的灵魂
    我被你的诱惑引来
    难道是为了一首诗的诞生
    这井口房的门板
    木纹里刻有你的身影
    这泥浆池的胸腔
    你的血液叮咚奔涌
    这地窝子荒凉的四壁
    录有你劳累后的鼾声
    连沉默的值班房
    斑驳的土油池
    都是铁人精神的见证
    老铁啊
    你是否还啃着冻窝窝头
    在刮大烟炮的夜晚
    披着那件老羊皮袄
    出门去巡井？
    铁人井是中国
    就连睡觉时
    也还睁着的眼睛
