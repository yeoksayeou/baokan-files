    New Pathways in Liver Transplantation

    According to reports, on November 27, the University of Chicago Medical Center removed a portion of the liver from a 29-year-old American woman named Dolores and transplanted it into her 21-month-old daughter. The infant was suffering from biliary atresia and required the removal of her diseased liver.

    The day after the surgery, the infant's transplanted liver experienced a common complication, bleeding, which was stopped after a second operation. The infant was in a "critical but stable" condition. The mother, who donated part of her liver, was in good condition and expected to be discharged from the hospital in about a week. By the 29th, the infant's condition had improved significantly.

    Doctors stated that the mother's liver would regenerate and recover within a month after the partial removal. The portion of the liver transplanted into the infant would grow along with the child.

    This type of surgery, involving the removal of a portion of a living person's organ for transplantation, is rare in medical history. If successful, it could address the issue of organ supply shortages. However, doctors noted that performing this surgery requires meeting specific conditions such as the timing, weight, and blood type of the transplanted liver.

    肝脏移植有新途径
    本报讯　据报道，11月27日，美国芝加哥大学医学中心从1名29岁的美国妇女多莱莎的身上取下一部分肝脏，移植到她21个月的女儿身上，因为这名女婴患胆管闭锁症，必须摘除患病的肝脏。
    手术后次日清晨，女婴移植的肝脏由于常见的并发症而出血，再次手术后血止住，处于“危急但稳定”的状态。提供部分肝脏的母亲情况良好，可望在一周后出院。29日女婴身体恢复良好。
    医生说，母亲的肝脏切除部分后能在一个月内再生，复原，移植到婴孩身上的那部分肝脏将与婴孩一起长大。
    这种从活人身上取部分器官进行移植的手术在医学史上尚属罕见。如能成功，将解决器官供应不足的问题，但医生指出进行这项手术，还必须具备移植肝脏的时间、重量及血型等条件。
