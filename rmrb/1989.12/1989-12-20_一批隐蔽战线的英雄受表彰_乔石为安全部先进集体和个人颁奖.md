Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 19th.

A batch of heroes who have long toiled diligently and struggled arduously on the covert front received awards today. The Ministry of State Security held a grand commendation conference, where a group of old comrades who have dedicated decades to the covert front, as well as outstanding collectives and individuals from the Ministry of State Security in the six years since its establishment, were commended.

Jo Shizhi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the conference and presented certificates of honor and merit awards to the representatives of the outstanding collectives and individuals.

Many of the old comrades who received certificates of honor have spent decades fighting on the covert front as pioneers of the revolution.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the broad ranks of Party members and cadres on the covert front have made important contributions to the birth of New China, to safeguarding national security, maintaining national stability, and promoting socialist economic construction and reform and opening up.

In his speech, Jia Chunwang, Minister of State Security, called on the Ministry and all national security personnel to, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, fulfill the glorious and arduous mission entrusted by the Party and the state to the national security organs, and make greater contributions to the construction and development of China's national security cause.
