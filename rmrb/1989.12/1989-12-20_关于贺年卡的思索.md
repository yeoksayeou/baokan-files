The New Year is approaching, and my daughter, who is in the fifth grade, asked me for money to buy New Year's cards to give to her classmates. She said that one of her classmates' father gave her 50 yuan to buy New Year's cards, and that some classmates are already preparing to give cards to the whole class. Although "children speak the truth," I still find it hard to believe, but in my disbelief, I have many thoughts.

Firstly, primary school students are in their childhood, and they should be lively and active in their studies, acquiring basic knowledge. If New Year's cards are flying everywhere in the classroom and school, with everyone giving and receiving, it not only distracts from learning focus and interest but, more seriously, leaves a vulgar and trivial impression of greeting and farewelling on young minds, which is not conducive to the healthy development of children's minds and bodies.

Secondly, the country has repeatedly called for hard work and living frugally for a few years. The mutual exchange of New Year's cards among primary school students is numerous and expensive. My daughter received one card, the size of 16th of a full sheet of paper, folded in the middle, without gold foil or embossing, priced at 1.20 yuan. She said that scented cards cost 1.50 yuan each, and musical cards cost over 8 yuan each. This undoubtedly wastes money for the nation and the family. If this money were used to buy some extracurricular reading materials or for classroom construction, it would be much more beneficial.

Thirdly, schools should strengthen ideological and political work, actively promote and discourage students (especially primary school students) from buying and giving New Year's cards. At the same time, they should vigorously carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work, encouraging and organizing students to make various styles of New Year's cards, such as drawings, collages, paper cuttings, and yarn crafts. This not only helps to develop students' creativity and cultivate their hands-on work ethic but also allows schools or classes to hold exhibitions and appreciation competitions for homemade New Year's cards, enriching students' extracurricular lives. It is also a very practical moral, intellectual, physical, and labor education.

To rectify the school atmosphere and promote spiritual civilization construction, I hope relevant departments will take action and prevent New Year's cards from "flying everywhere" in primary schools!

    关于贺年卡的思索
    杨嵩霖
    新年即将来临，读小学五年级的女儿向我要钱买贺年卡赠送同学，并说她班里一女同学的爸爸一次就给50元钱用来买贺年卡，还说有的同学已经准备“全班赠”。尽管“童言无欺”，我还是不敢相信，却在不敢相信之中生出许多感慨。
    之一，小学生乃是儿童时期，理应生动活泼地学习，掌握基础知识。如果在班内、校内贺年片“满天飞”，你赠我送，不但分散了学习精力和兴趣，而且更严重的是在幼小心灵上打上了一种庸俗无聊、迎来送往的烙印，不利于儿童身心的健康。
    之二，现在，国家一再号召艰苦奋斗，过几年紧日子。小学生互赠贺年卡，数量大，价格昂贵。我女儿收到一张，16开纸大小，中间对折，无烫金、无凸印，价格1.20元。她说香味的1.50元一张，音乐的8元多一张。这无疑给国家、家庭造成浪费。如果用这笔钱买些课外读物，或者用于班级建设，岂不大有益处？
    之三，学校应加强思想政治工作，积极宣传、劝阻学生（尤其是小学生）不要购买、赠送贺年卡，同时应大力发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，鼓励和组织学生自制各种式样的贺年卡，如绘画的、粘贴的、剪纸的、绒线的……这不但有利于开发学生的创造能力，培养自己动手的劳动意识，而且学校或班级可以举办自制贺年卡展览、欣赏评比活动，丰富学生的课余生活，同时是非常实际的德、智、体、劳教育。
    为端正校风，促进精神文明建设，愿有关方面行动起来，别让贺年卡在小学校里“满天飞”！
