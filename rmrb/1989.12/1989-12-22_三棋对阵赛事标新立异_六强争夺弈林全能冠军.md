Early next year, Beijing will host an unprecedented super tournament in the chess world. The top players from the fields of Go, Chinese Chess, and International Chess will each send two elite players to compete in a unique event, aiming to win the first-ever all-around champion title in Chinese chess history.

Although Go, Chinese Chess, and International Chess have different names and distinct strategies, there are many individuals who have excelled in one discipline and are also proficient in others.

The first Hua Yuan Cup Three-Board All-Around Super Tournament, scheduled to take place from January 20th to 24th next year, will feature six chess players: Go grandmaster Nie Weiping and the recently recovered Chen Zude, ninth dan; Chinese Chess grandmasters Hu Ronghua and Li Laiqun; International Chess grandmasters Liu Wenjie and the 1964 national International Chess champion, Jian Huisu. The tournament will use a single round-robin format, with each player competing in all three types of chess simultaneously in each match. The time limit for each match is two hours, and any player who exceeds this time will lose. Points will be awarded separately for each type of chess, and the final ranking will be determined by the total points accumulated.

Go grandmaster Nie Weiping recently visited the International Chess training camp to seek guidance, aiming to secure high scores in this discipline. Chen Zude, who has been retired for many years, will soon travel to Shanghai to play a warm-up match against Liu Xiaoguang to ensure he maintains his strength in his main discipline. The twelve-time champion Hu Ronghua has started studying Go, while Liu Wenjie, who originally learned Chinese Chess, is revisiting his old skills while secretly studying Go.

    三棋对阵赛事标新立异  六强争夺弈林全能冠军
    本报讯  记者缪鲁报道：明年初，北京将举办一场前所未有的弈林超级大赛，由围棋、象棋和国际象棋界各自派出两位顶尖人物，三棋同弈，争夺中国棋艺史上的第一个全能冠军称号。
    围棋、象棋和国际象棋虽名目不同，棋理各异，但钻研一棋而有成就者和兼通旁门堪称全才者皆不乏人。
    定于明年元月二十日至二十四日进行的首届华远杯三棋全能超级大赛，六位棋手是：聂卫平棋圣和病愈复出的陈祖德九段，象棋特级大师胡荣华和李来群，国际象棋特级大师刘文哲和一九六四年的全国国际象棋冠军简怀穗。比赛采用单循环制，每场比赛每人同时下三种棋，限时两小时，超时判负。三种棋分别计分，以总分高低定名次。围棋棋圣聂卫平日前已专程到国际象棋集训队登门拜师，力争在该项目上取得高分。隐退多年的陈祖德九段定于近日赴上海与刘小光对弈热身，以保届时在主项上不失手。十二冠王胡荣华开始封门打围棋谱，而学象棋出身的刘文哲在重习旧艺的同时，还悄悄地钻研起围棋之道。
