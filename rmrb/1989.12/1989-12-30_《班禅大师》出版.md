The book "The Panchen Lama" has been published by the Eastern Publishing House. This is the first book in China to introduce the extraordinary life of Panchen Erdeni Qojye Gyaincain, an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism.

The Panchen Lama was born into an ordinary Tibetan family and became the 10th Panchen Lama at the age of 11. His life spanned a period of significant political changes in China. Amidst various political storms, the Panchen Lama endured numerous hardships but remained steadfast in his love for his country and his support for the Communist Party of China. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Panchen Lama resumed his official duties, working diligently and selflessly until his untimely death.

The author, Jiangbian Qiazuo, is a deputy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and was formerly the Panchen Lama's translator. Over many years, he has collected a wealth of materials, making this book a valuable resource with many little-known historical details.
