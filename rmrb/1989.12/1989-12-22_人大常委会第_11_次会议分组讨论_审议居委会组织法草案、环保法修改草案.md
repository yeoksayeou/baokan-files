The 11th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress has been held in groups over the past few days to review the draft Urban Residents' Committee Organization Law and the revised draft Environmental Protection Law.

Regarding the draft Urban Residents' Committee Organization Law, members of the committee believe that the draft has undergone several rounds of review and has incorporated opinions from various sectors, undergoing multiple revisions. It is now quite mature and complete, and they recommend that this meeting of the Standing Committee pass it.

Many committee members agreed with the Legal Affairs Committee's amendment to the draft, changing the provision that residents' committees can engage in "production" services to allowing them to engage in services related to public convenience and welfare. They believe that this regulation is more flexible, allowing different regions to decide on the types of services to be provided based on their own characteristics and specific conditions.

During the review of the revised draft Environmental Protection Law, committee members pointed out that enacting environmental protection laws is an urgent matter, and they hope it can be passed and implemented as soon as possible. They believe that environmental protection is a major issue affecting the national economy and people's livelihoods. Without legislation, the losses will be enormous, and the harm will be endless. Therefore, environmental protection legislation is an urgent task.

Many committee members suggested establishing a supervisory body to manage environmental protection work, implementing unified supervision and management, especially by township governments, which should strengthen the supervision and management of environmental protection work. They emphasized the importance of building a strong environmental protection team to ensure that environmental protection work is carried out effectively. For those who cause serious environmental pollution, legal responsibility should be pursued.

    人大常委会第11次会议分组讨论
    审议居委会组织法草案、环保法修改草案
    新华社北京12月21日电  七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议连日举行分组会，审议城市居民委员会组织法草案、环境保护法修改草案。
    关于城市居民委员会组织法草案，委员们在审议中认为，这个草案经过几次会议审议，又征求了各方面的意见，进行了多次修改，已经比较成熟、完善，建议这次常委会会议予以通过。
    许多委员对法律委员会对草案中关于居委会可以兴办“生产”生活服务事业，修改为可以兴办与便民利民有关的服务事业，表示同意，认为这样规定比较灵活，各地可以根据自己的特点和具体条件决定兴办什么样的服务事业。
    在审议环境保护法（修改草案）时，委员们指出，制定环保法是非常紧迫的事情，希望尽快通过实施。他们认为，环境保护是关系国计民生的大问题，环保不立法，损失巨大，贻害无穷。因此，环保立法是当务之急。
    许多委员建议，要有一个监督机构来管理环保工作，实行统一的监督管理，特别是乡镇政府要加强对环保工作的监督管理，要重视加强环保队伍的建设，把环保工作落到实处。对造成环境污染后果严重的，应当依法追究责任。
