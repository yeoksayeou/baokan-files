	Arbitrary Fees Hinder the Circulation of Agricultural Products
	Experts Suggest Abolishing the Practice of Giving Personal Bonuses for Fees and Fines

	Reporter Pan Gang of this newspaper has learned from relevant departments that some places are seeing a resurgence of arbitrary roadblocks, fees, and fines, which are exacerbating the accumulation of specialty products such as apples, oranges, and mushrooms. Experts suggest that the practice of linking personal income to the collection of fees and fines by law enforcement agencies should be abolished as soon as possible.

	This winter, a business unit in Yanbei, Shanxi Province, was transporting a batch of sunflower seeds to coastal areas for sale. Before leaving the province, it was charged three times by three counties along the way. In Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, oranges this year had to pay 17 different taxes and fees from the time they were picked to the time they were loaded for transport within the county. According to a joint investigation by the Dalian Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Price Bureau, during the apple purchasing and selling period this autumn, the Songshu Commercial Bureau in Delisi Town, Wafangdian City, and the town's railway station arbitrarily charged a "management fee" of 100 yuan per car of apples. Not long ago, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Siping Town, Qixia County, Shandong Province, shipped a car of 30 tons of apples. Within the county, they paid 64.4 yuan for quarantine fees, 120 yuan for agricultural development funds, 30 yuan for special product taxes, 20 yuan for transit permits, and 192 yuan for afforestation funds, totaling 426.4 yuan. When the car passed through Laixi County, it was again charged 90 yuan for agricultural development funds and 120 yuan for quarantine fees.

	The Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly emphasized the need to resolutely stop arbitrary roadblocks, fees, and fines, so why do some places ignore these directives? A responsible person from the Ministry of Commerce believes that the main reason is that the current administrative law enforcement agencies link the collection of fees and fines to personal income. The more they collect and fine, the more income the enforcers receive. Given that fresh fruits and mushrooms are perishable and not suitable for long-term storage, experts believe that to fundamentally solve the problem of arbitrary fees, it is essential to improve the legal system and the quality of the law enforcement team. However, to promote benefits and eliminate harm, and to smooth the circulation channels, the urgent task at hand is to resolutely abolish the practice of some law enforcement agencies giving personal bonuses for fees and fines.

    乱收费阻碍农产品流通
    专家建议取消收费罚款个人提成做法
    本报记者　潘岗
    记者从有关部门了解到，一些地方乱设卡、乱收费、乱罚款现象正死灰复燃，加剧了苹果、柑桔、蘑菇等土特产品的积压。有关专家建议，尽快取消各执法机关用收费、罚款收入提成给个人的做法。
    今年初冬，山西雁北某经营单位运送一批葵花籽去沿海地区销售，未出省就被路经的三个县重复收费三次。四川资中县，今年柑桔从下树到装运，在县境内就要交纳各种税费17项。据大连市供销社和物价局联合调查，今秋苹果购销期间，瓦房店市得利寺镇松树工商所和该镇火车站自定收取“管理费”，每车皮苹果收费100元。不久前，山东省栖霞县寺口镇供销社，发运一车皮30吨苹果，在本县交了检疫费64.4元、农业开发基金120元、特产税30元、准运证费20元、育林基金192元，合计426.4元。当车过莱西县时又被收去农业开发基金90元、检疫费120元。
    坚决制止乱设卡、收费、罚款，党中央、国务院已三令五申，为什么一些地方置若罔闻？商业部一位负责人认为，主要是目前各行政执法机关实行收费、罚款收入与个人收入“挂钩”。收、罚得越多，“执罚”者收入越多。鉴于鲜果、鲜蘑易腐不宜久贮，有关专家认为，根治乱收费，自然有赖于法制的健全和执法队伍素质的提高，但为兴利除弊，疏通流通渠道，当务之急是坚决取消一些执法机关用收费、罚款提成给个人的做法。
