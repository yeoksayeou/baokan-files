Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, December 4th.

The Palestine Liberation Organization has submitted a memorandum to the United States, insisting on its right to determine the members of the Palestinian delegation, as its final response to U.S. Secretary of State Baker's five-point proposal for Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.

The memorandum states, "Without the appointment and announcement by the PLO, there cannot be a Palestinian delegation at the negotiating table."

The memorandum reiterates that the PLO is prepared to engage in dialogue with the Israeli authorities. However, the agenda for the dialogue must be made public and without preconditions. The memorandum expresses the PLO's regret over the U.S.'s disregard for its right to form the delegation.

This memorandum was handed over on December 1st during a new round of meetings between the PLO and the United States, by the PLO's chief representative and PLO representative in Tunis, Barawi.

Sri Lankan President Narasimha Rao Premadasa, on November 29th, in a speech commemorating "International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People," stated that Sri Lanka has consistently supported the just cause of the Palestinian people.

He believes that an international conference convened under the auspices of the United Nations would be the most effective forum for discussing the Palestinian issue.

President Premadasa pointed out that the tension and instability in the Middle East are due to the unresolved Palestinian issue. He emphasized that without restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, there will be no peace and security in the Middle East. He stressed that Israeli troops must withdraw from Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories.

    巴解向美国递交备忘录
    坚持由巴解组团同以对话
    新华社突尼斯12月4日电  据《突尼斯新闻报》4日报道，巴勒斯坦解放组织已经向美国递交了一份备忘录，坚持由它确定巴勒斯坦代表团人选的权利，以作为它对美国国务卿贝克关于巴以对话5点建议的最后答复。
    备忘录指出，“没有巴解组织的任命和宣布，不可能有巴勒斯坦代表团走到谈判桌旁。”
    备忘录重申，巴解组织准备同以色列当局展开对话。但是，对话日程必须公开，并且不带先决条件。备忘录说，巴解组织对美国无视由它组团的权利表示遗憾。
    这份备忘录是1日巴解组织同美国举行新的一轮会晤时，由巴解首席代表、巴解驻突尼斯代表巴拉维转交的。
    新华社科伦坡电　斯里兰卡总统纳拉辛哈·普雷马达萨11月29日在纪念“声援巴勒斯坦人民国际日”之际发表谈话说，斯里兰卡一贯支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义事业。
    他认为，在联合国主持下召开的国际会议将是讨论巴勒斯坦问题的最有效的论坛。
    普雷马达萨总统指出，中东局势之所以紧张和不稳定是由于巴勒斯坦问题没有解决，如不恢复巴勒斯坦人民不可剥夺的民族权利，中东就不会有和平与安全。他强调，以色列军队必须撤出巴勒斯坦及其他被占阿拉伯领土。
