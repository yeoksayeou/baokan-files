Title: Cannot "Fight Alone"

Only the land management departments are working, while "outsiders" stand by and do nothing. This is a relatively common phenomenon in land management work.

When it comes to the fundamental national policy of family planning, why are so many departments and personnel mobilized? If the awareness of leaders in various industries and departments regarding the importance of cherishing every inch of land is not addressed, then while they may say it is a "national policy," in actual work, it may be another matter entirely. This would make it very difficult to truly elevate it to the status of a national policy.

China's land management work is just beginning, with a shortage of personnel and a lack of experience. The increasingly apparent land crisis urgently requires us to mobilize the entire nation, from thought to action. We cannot "fight alone."

    不能“孤军作战”
    光是土地管理部门干事，“局外人”袖手旁观，这是土地管理工作中比较普遍的现象。
    同是“基本国策，搞计划生育动员的部门、人员为什么能那么多？珍惜每寸土地，各行业、部门领导的思想认识问题如果不解决，嘴巴上说是“国策”，实际工作中又是另一回事，那将很难把它真正提到国策地位。
    我国土地管理工作刚起步，人手不多，经验缺乏，日益显露的土地危机迫切要求我们从思想到行动上全民动员。不能“孤军作战”。
