Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, December 19th.

Currently, Tangshan City in Hebei Province is bustling with the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects. This year, nearly 400,000 laborers have participated in the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects across the city.

The investment structure for agriculture has undergone a fundamental change, gradually forming a new mechanism of self-accumulation with farmers' investments as the mainstay. This year, the city's investment in agricultural water conservancy construction reached 190 million yuan, an increase of 72% compared to last year. Of the total investment, 73% comes from farmers' self-investment, and 19.31 million labor days have been invested, an increase of 3.9 times compared to last year.
