Title: The Terrible "Dike-Eating Land"

After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, most rural areas have their arable land contracted to individual households. According to the principle of equalizing good and bad land among households, land plots with different geographical locations, irrigation conditions, and fertility levels are generally divided and allocated in a fragmented manner. This has artificially created an unreasonable pattern of many dikes and small plots. In our county, the total number of paddy fields in 1980 was 425,800 mu, divided into 454,608 plots, with an average of 0.94 mu per plot. By 1984, after the implementation of the responsibility system, this increased to 682,855 plots, with an average of 0.62 mu per plot. A prominent drawback of this "every household contracts land, with good and bad land equally divided" approach is "dike-eating land," where newly built dikes occupy a large amount of cultivated land. Just in Huaining County, the newly added dikes after the implementation of the responsibility system approximately wasted 2,100 mu of paddy fields, accounting for about 5% of the original total paddy field area. Extrapolated to the entire country, this is undoubtedly a shocking and terrifying figure. Therefore, it is hoped that various levels of government and relevant departments will take effective measures in a timely manner. Based on stabilizing the household contract responsibility system, supplemented by other measures, efforts should be made to stop and avoid the endless division of land plots, making them smaller and smaller, so as to truly protect and fully utilize land resources.

### 可怕的“埂吃地”

    可怕的“埂吃地”
    安徽省怀宁县　王学龙
    实行联产承包责任制后，农村绝大多数地方的耕地都是以户承包，根据户户种地和好坏均摊原则，对地理位置、排灌条件、肥瘦程度等类型不同的地块一般都零碎划分、搭配发包，人为造成埂多地块小的不合理格局。我县1980年42.58万亩水田总块数为454608块，块均0.94亩；到实行责任制后的1984年，增加到682855块，块均0.62亩。这样“家家都包田，孬好碎而全”的一个突出弊端是“埂吃地”，即新筑的田埂侵占了大量熟地。仅以怀宁县实行责任制后新增的田埂匡算，约浪费水田2100余亩，占原水田总面积的5％左右。推及全国，无疑是一个惊人和可怕的数目。因此，希望各级政府和有关部门对此及早采取有效措施，在稳定家庭联产承包责任制基础上，辅之以其他措施，尽量制止和避免田块无限分割，越变越小，以切实保护和充分利用土地资源。
