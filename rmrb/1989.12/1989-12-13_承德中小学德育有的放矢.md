Chengde has consistently prioritized moral education in primary and secondary schools, enhancing overall effectiveness, optimizing the educational environment, and creating a new landscape for moral education.

Emphasis, Leadership, Strengthening—Forming a Reliable Guarantee. The municipal party committee and government have designated a deputy mayor to lead the moral education work, establishing a leadership group to oversee and guide the city's moral education efforts. The municipal party committee holds a meeting every six months with the participation of the five major leadership groups to hear reports on moral education work from relevant departments and to address prominent issues in different periods. Counties, districts, townships, and educational departments have established and improved organizational structures for moral education, implementing multi-level systems such as the "Moral Education Leadership Responsibility System," "Moral Education Evaluation Methods," and "Teacher Moral Education Percentage System." Schools that do not meet moral education standards in a year are not eligible for the title of "Advanced Unit in Spiritual Civilization," and principal leaders are not eligible for the title of "Advanced Worker." They have provided over 60 primary and secondary schools with more than 100 moral education staff and trained over 600 teachers.

Practical, Innovative, Deepening—Adhering to the "Three Combinations."

First, combining classroom education with extracurricular activities. Through political and ideological and moral education courses, students systematically learn and discuss "norms," and use the content of "norms" to occupy the extracurricular activity front. In primary and secondary schools, they have also launched the "Write a Diary, Do a Good Deed" activity. Students across the city have written over 20,000 diaries and done over 50,000 good deeds.

Second, combining "Five Loves" education with social investigation and practice. They adopt the approach of "inviting in and going out," inviting over 100 experts from various industries to give "Five Loves" themed reports based on their personal experiences. During holidays, they organize students to visit military units, factories, and rural areas for inspections and investigations. Over 60 primary and secondary schools have held over 100 themed essay contests such as "I Love Socialism" and "I Love My Hometown," with over 20,000 students participating in social investigations, over 200 themed lectures, and over 30 themed art exhibitions, educating over 40,000 students.

Third, combining exemplary education with establishing models. First, they focus on student exemplars. This year, in the city's selection of 100 good people and good deeds, primary and secondary schools accounted for 36. Next, they focus on teacher exemplars, establishing 8 advanced schools and 17 outstanding moral education workers, using newspapers and radio to extensively promote and encourage teachers to focus on moral education work.

School, Family, Society—Jointly Creating an Educational Environment. The municipal education commission coordinates with the trade union, Communist Youth League, Women's Federation, and cultural departments to form the "Care for the Next Generation Association" and "Moral Education Research Association," jointly organizing over 40 training classes on art, calligraphy, music, and dance with healthy and educational content, training over 3,000 students. Various departments actively take on the responsibility of optimizing the social educational environment, with newspapers, radio, and television stations jointly organizing over 90 special columns, special editions, and special programs; judicial departments organizing over 40 special exhibitions, students watching over 20 legal education special videos, and cultural departments providing nearly a million books beneficial to students' physical and mental health, educating over 60,000 students.

They also organized 30 parenting classes, training over 2,500 parents of children aged 7 to 14.

At the same time, the city has established a "Contact Card" and "Feedback Card" system between schools and parents.

    承德中小学德育有的放矢
    王曙光　欧秀光　寇占文
    承德市坚持把中小学德育教育放到整个教育工作的首位，发挥整体效能，优化育人环境，开创了德育教育的新局面。
    重视、上位、加强——形成可靠保证。市委、市政府确定一名主管副市长牵头，成立德育工作领导小组，负责对全市德育工作进行检查指导。市委半年召开一次五大班子领导参加的常委扩大会议，听取有关部门关于德育工作汇报，研究解决不同时期的突出问题。县区、乡镇和教育部门分别建立健全了德育工作组织机构，分层次制定了《德育工作领导责任制》、《德育工作考评办法》、《教师德育工作百分制》等项制度。每年德育工作未达标的学校不予评为精神文明先进单位，主要领导不予评为先进工作者。他们为60多所中小学配备了100多名德育工作人员，培训教师600多人次。
    求实、创新、深化——坚持“三个结合”。
    一是课堂教育与课外活动相结合。通过政治课、思想品德课系统地学“规范”讲“规范”，并用“规范”的内容，占领课外活动的阵地。在中小学里还开展了“写一篇日记，做一件好事”活动，全市中小学生共写日记两万多篇，做好事5万多件次。
    二是“五爱”教育与社会调查实践相结合。他们采取“请进来，走出去”的办法，先后聘请了100多名各行各业的校外辅导员用自己切身体验做“五爱”专题报告。节假日，组织学生到部队、工厂、农村参观调查。60多所中小学共举办“我爱社会主义”、“我爱家乡”征文100多期次，参加社会调查两万多人次，举办专题讲演200多期次、专题画展30多期次，受教育学生达4万人次。
    三是典型教育与树立样板相结合。首先抓好学生典型，今年全市开展的评选百件好人好事中，中小学就占了36件。其次抓好教师典型，先后树立了8个先进学校和17名优秀德育工作者，利用报纸、电台大力宣传，鼓励教师抓好德育工作。
    学校、家庭、社会——共创育人环境。市教委协调工会、共青团、妇联、文化等部门组成了“关心下一代协会”、“德育教育研究会”，共同举办内容健康、富有教育意义的美术、书法、音乐、舞蹈培训班40多期次，培训学生3000多名。各部门主动担负起优化社会育人环境的责任，报社、电台、电视台共组建专版、专栏、专题节目90多期次；司法部门办专题橱窗40多期，学生收看法制教育专题录像20多场次；文化部门提供有益于学生身心健康的各类图书近百万册，受教育学生达6万多人次。
    他们还办家长学校30期次，培训7至14岁少儿家长2500多名。
    同时，该市还在学校和家长之间建立“联系卡”和“反馈卡”制度。
