The discussion column "How to Cherish Every Inch of Land?" has been published since late October and has consistently received support and welcome from a wide range of readers. The editorial department receives nearly a hundred letters and articles daily. Many readers have sincerely expressed, "It is imperative to strengthen national land awareness education." "Let us work together to protect this land left to us by our ancestors!" The facts have proven that readers and we are in sync. Similar national conditions education will be carried out in the future.

Over a dozen discussions and dozens of articles have focused on nearly ten issues of concern to everyone. We believe these issues are quite important. Some issues have reached relatively consistent opinions, while others still have disagreements, and a few have only scratched the surface. In summary, all of them need further exploration in the future from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

It is worth emphasizing that during the discussion, there was a consensus that solving China's potential land crisis relies on two main approaches: first, managing and utilizing existing arable land effectively; second, reducing the population birth rate through all possible means. These "two approaches" are interconnected and equally significant. This consensus is very valuable, and we will strive to make more people aware of it and come up with more practical measures to implement it. The discussion concludes here. We would like to thank the readers for their concern and support once again. Land issues and national land awareness education remain one of our propaganda tasks. In the future, we will continue to handle relevant manuscripts and letters seriously, incorporating them into our daily propaganda and reporting.

    结束语
    《怎样珍惜每寸土地？》讨论专栏自10月底见报以来，一直得到广大读者的支持和欢迎。编辑部每天收到近百件来信、来稿。不少读者发自内心地说：“加强全民国土观念教育已经到了刻不容缓的时候了。”“让我们共同保护好祖先留下的这一片土地！”事实证明，读者和我们是心心相通的，类似的国情教育今后还将陆续认真进行下去。
    十多期讨论，几十篇文章，集中论述了大家关心的近十个问题。我们认为这些问题都是相当重要的，其中有的问题得出了比较一致的意见，有的则还有分歧，个别的甚至仅仅触及皮毛，总之都有待于今后我们从理论和实践结合上进一步探讨。
    值得强调的是，讨论中大家比较一致地认为，解决我国潜在的土地危机问题，一靠管好用好现有耕地；二靠千方百计降低人口出生率。“两靠”相互联系，而又具有同等意义。这个共识是非常宝贵的，我们今后要让更多的人知道它，想出更多的可行措施实践它。讨论到此告一段落。我们要再一次感谢读者的关心和支持。土地问题、国土观念教育仍是我们的宣传任务之一，今后我们将一如既往认真处理有关稿件、来信，把它们列入日常的宣传报道。
