Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 12th.

The Nanjing Museum archaeological team recently discovered a human sacrifice tomb dating back approximately 5,000 years in the northern part of Jiangsu Province, in Xinyi County, along with a batch of jade artifacts from the Liangzhu Culture period.

The Neolithic ancient tombs at Huamen in Xinyi County's Maling Mountain are a relatively large group of tombs. This year, 40 tombs were excavated and cleared, including 5 large ones. Generally, these tombs have pits measuring 5 meters in length and 3 meters in width. The deceased in these tombs are all male, with male and female adolescents sacrificed at their feet or sides, usually one or two individuals. In Tomb No. 60, five people were sacrificed around and above the deceased, including one child, all seemingly household slaves. Experts from the Shanghai Natural History Museum, including Deputy Professor Huang Xianghong, identified this as the earliest human sacrifice tomb in China, dating back to the middle to late period of the Dawenkou Culture, around 5,000 years ago. Experts believe that this discovery provides an important example for exploring the origins of slavery in China.

In addition to the human sacrifice tombs at Huamen in Xinyi County, several hundred pieces of pottery and jade artifacts were also unearthed. Some of these artifacts include bi discs, cong tubes, rings, perforated axes, beads, and tubes, with some jade artifacts featuring human and animal face decorations. Experts have determined that these characteristics are similar to those of jade artifacts from the Liangzhu Culture period in the Jiangnan region. Experts believe that this discovery is significant for the study of the formation and development of the Chinese nation.

    江苏发现我国最早人殉墓葬
    为探索奴隶制起源提供重要实例
    新华社南京12月12日电  南京博物院考古队最近在江苏北部新沂县发现距今5000年左右的人殉墓葬和一批良渚文化时期的玉器等器物。
    位于新沂县马陵山的花门新石器时代古墓葬是一个规模较大的墓葬群。今年发掘清理的40座墓葬中，有5座大墓，一般有长5米、宽3米的墓坑，墓主皆为男性，脚后或身侧都殉葬男女少年各一、二人。在60号大墓中，墓主两侧及上方共殉葬5人，其中1人为儿童，均似家内奴隶。经上海自然博物馆人类学专家黄象洪副教授等专家鉴定，这是中国最早的人殉墓葬，年代为距今5000年上下的大汶口文化中晚期。专家们认为这次发掘为探索中国奴隶制起源提供了重要实例。
    在新沂县花门墓葬中还清理出随葬陶器、玉器各数百件，还有一些石器和骨器。玉器中有璧、琮、环、穿孔斧、珠、管等，有些玉器上刻有人面和兽面纹饰。据专家考证，这与江南良渚文化时期玉器的特征大致相同。专家们认为，这对研究中华民族的形成与发展有重要意义。
