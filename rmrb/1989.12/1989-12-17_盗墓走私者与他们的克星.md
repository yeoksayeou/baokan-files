The Tomb Raiders and Their Nemesis

“3.15” Witness Account – This should be the conclusion of the article, but here it is used as the opening.

Due to the deployment of the public security bureau in the suburbs of Luoyang, I was temporarily unable to arrange to visit Mapo Village, where tomb raiding is most severe. Therefore, I had to conduct my last activity with a few young anti-smuggling team members – climbing Mount Mang to experience the situation firsthand.

On March 15, the weather was excellent, with the sun shining brightly and the sky clear. Anti-smuggling team leader Guo Yong drove us east out of Luoyang, bypassing Mapo, and headed straight for Jinjia Gorge, finally stopping at Panlong Tomb (Village) – the peak of Mount Mang. Today’s North Mangshan has long lost the lush greenery described in ancient poetry and literature. It is exposed, showing its yellow skin, except for some imperial tombs and tombs of nobles standing like small hills. Most ancient tombs have been eroded by years of rain and have lost their surface mounds, scattered in the layered terraces and gullies. I had no time to indulge in the ancient thoughts of “ten thousand tombs unrecognizable” and “bones decayed into mud.” I was already shocked by the scene of desolation before me.

On the less than 2-kilometer road from Panlong Tomb to Magou Village, I saw from the car more than ten ancient tombs that had been raided, some of which had been hastily refilled, and many had not even been refilled. The car stopped in a terrace of less than 10 acres north of Panlong Tomb Village, where I could clearly see the dense, orderly, and neatly arranged exploration holes. It is said that wherever this kind of “nesting” occurs, it is like combing through with a comb, leaving no artifacts underground. The raided tombs had black, gaping holes, and the Han and Tang dynasty tomb door bricks were smashed and carelessly discarded on the ground, mixed with many black pottery fragments. Facing this scene of desolation and chaos, it was hard to believe that this was the Chinese people’s own plunder and destruction of their country’s cultural heritage!

The car drove into a brick and tile kiln in Daliwang Village. Guo Yong’s original intention was to let me see the scene of a tomb raiding case that was cracked down on here last year. Now, the kiln has been abandoned, but around the old exploration holes, new holes have been dug again…

Not far south of the kiln is the Mangshan Grand Canal, which was dug in 1958. The water flows rapidly in the 10-meter-deep cliff, while on the opposite side of the canal, 500 meters away in the wheat field, someone was openly swinging an exploration shovel (also known as a tomb-digging shovel, a long-handled iron shovel specifically used for digging tombs) up and down, probably enjoying it very much. The person digging the tomb was wearing only a red autumn shirt, which was very eye-catching in the setting sun. Perhaps they wanted to explore whether they could cross the canal. One of the anti-smuggling team members, Xu Lintao, quietly climbed down the cliff. Not finding a way to cross, of course, it was impossible to reach the tomb raider on the opposite shore who was focused on his work. However, Xu Lintao, who had just climbed back up, brought another piece of bad news: another Han tomb had been raided under the cliff. None of us spoke, as we were all looking at the clear outline of a new tomb raiding hole on the opposite shore…

Ancient Sacred Land and Deformed Professions

To the north of Luoyang, known as the “Nine-Dynasty Capital,” there is a mountain range stretching over 100 kilometers east to west. Although it is not high or dangerous, it is not majestic or rugged, it is famous and well-known. Its name is Mount Mang, also known as North Mangshan.

From 770 BC onwards, the Eastern Zhou, Eastern Han, Cao Wei, Western Jin, Northern Wei, Sui, Tang, Later Liang, and Later Tang dynasties successively established their capitals in Luoyang, lasting for 1,000 years. Over the centuries, countless nobles and aristocrats have gathered on this ancient land, but it is impossible to count them all. However, it is historically recorded that during the Han and Tang dynasties, Luoyang became a metropolis with a population of over a million.

In the long Middle Ages, people’s minds were filled with feudal consciousness and religious emotions. The wealthy hoped to benefit their descendants, and the poor yearned to change their fate in this life. All of this ultimately converged on one point – being buried in a windwater treasure land after death. Thus, the south had the majestic Yique, the north had the vast Yellow River, and the scenic and fertile Mount Mang became the focus of everyone’s attention. As time passed, North Mangshan became one of China’s famous cemeteries. An ancient folk song says, “There is no place to lie down in Mount Mang!” This shows how densely packed the ancient tombs are.

Since people placed their enjoyment in the afterlife and the underground paradise, society inevitably developed the bad habit of extravagant burials. It is recorded in history that Liu Wu, the son of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, had 100,000 pounds of gold buried with him alone. Slaves, livestock, courtyards, houses, and even daily utensils that were not allowed or inconvenient to be buried were made into models of wood, pottery, or metal and placed in the tomb. As for gardens, forests, or scenes of feasting and hunting, they were painted on the tomb walls. Over time, all of this has become invaluable artifacts.

The origin of the extravagant burial habit was absurd, but it attracted some greedy people to plunder. In 191 AD, Dong Zhuo was defeated and fled west, taking away from Luoyang “the treasures from the tombs of the emperors and the tombs of officials and below, collecting their precious treasures,” marking the beginning of tomb raiding, which continued unabated in subsequent dynasties.

However, the most shocking large-scale tomb raiding activities occurred in modern times. In 1905, the construction of the Longhai Railway’s Luoyang section began, with the route passing through the southern foothills of Mount Mang, destroying the ancient tombs there and unearthed many precious artifacts. Foreign technicians and antique dealers from Shanghai competed to buy them, sparking a rampant wave of tomb raiding. Originally, Mount Mang suffered from severe soil erosion. After heavy rains, some ancient tombs were washed away and exposed. At that time, people still regarded burial goods as inauspicious items, but after the antique dealers arrived, their attitudes began to change rapidly. After the rain stopped, people would carry shovels and search for antiques to sell. This kind of tomb raiding seemed to have some elements of waiting for the rabbit to come, but in reality, the tomb raiders had already formed a large professional army. After 1928, from the warlord wars to the Japanese puppet period, this trend reached its peak. Someone once estimated that by the time Luoyang was liberated, about 50,000 ancient tombs had been raided, and about 500,000 artifacts had been unearthed. It is no wonder that Luoyang has the saying “nine out of ten tombs are empty.” In fact, after liberation, the series of archaeological excavations carried out by cultural relics workers in conjunction with basic construction projects also proved this point.

The Resurgence of Tomb Raiding and Artifact Smuggling

After liberation, Luoyang’s tomb raiding activities indeed disappeared for a while, but during the late Cultural Revolution and especially after 1976, they became rampant again. In fact, in various illegal activities to make huge profits, tomb raiding and artifact smuggling are very tempting. A Tang Dynasty tri-colored horse figurine, about a foot high, can be sold for tens of millions of yuan on the black market in Guangzhou! Moreover, in Mount Mang, where there is “no place to lie down,” it is not difficult to raid ancient tombs. A young farmer named “Lai Wa” had nothing to do, so he invited two other farmers to carry tomb-digging shovels and search for ancient tombs all over the mountain. In terms of age and experience, they were a bit inexperienced in this line of work, and they couldn’t even tell the difference between the soil they dug out, so they had to ask someone to identify it. The result was that in ten days, they dug and sold artifacts from one Tang tomb and one Zhou tomb (including one that had been previously raided), and in addition to a few tri-colored pieces, there were also five bronze artifacts, including a tripod, a gu, and a zun, earning 40,000 yuan, with each person getting 13,000 yuan, averaging a daily income of 1,300 yuan. Those experienced old tomb raiders would dig during the day, accurately locating the position of the ancient tombs, and at night, they would dig a vertical shaft on the ground that was only wide enough for their shoulders (40-45 cm wide, 130-140 cm long) to reach the burial chamber, and then they could take all the artifacts. There are so many ancient tombs, and illicit wealth is easily obtained, so it is no wonder that tomb raiders flock to it (this kind of adventure sometimes also requires a high price. In 1986, two farmers from Taowan Village died of suffocation due to lack of oxygen in the tomb). Coincidentally, in this wave of tomb raiding, Mapo, Taowan, Beiyao, Panlong Tomb, Jinjia Gorge, and other villages are still the ones with the most tomb raiders, and even 10-year-old children know how to dig for tombs.

At the same time as the tomb raiders, there were also artifact smugglers. These people also have different levels of sophistication. Some directly act as “Hong Kong clients’” runners, while others act as “Guangdong clients’” runners. They often stay in high-end hotels, ride luxury taxis, and as soon as they get their hands on the artifacts, they fly straight to Guangzhou. After getting off the plane, they use a “BB machine,” and within a few minutes, they can find their boss, and the stolen goods are sold. This type of person dresses well and pays attention to their appearance, and at first glance, they might be mistaken for compatriots from Hong Kong or Macao or university professors. A man named Da Guozi, an artifact smuggler, was dressed in the latest fashion and could speak fluent Cantonese. He had a young assistant with him, posing as a Hong Kong client and staying in a high-end hotel. These two types of people are relatively few, but there are more third and fourth-tier, or even unqualified, smugglers, a group of local people, small waiters. They often lack capital and rely on brokering deals from both ends, cheating and swindling to earn “commission fees.” Don’t underestimate these artifact smugglers. Although their cultural level is not high, and many are even illiterate, they also know a little about artifact identification and dating. Otherwise, if they get a fake artifact, they would jump off a cliff or lie on the tracks and lose their entire family’s fortune.

In the Luoyang Suburban Public Security Bureau detention center, I asked Da Guozi, who was being interrogated there, how many people in Luoyang were involved in tomb raiding and artifact smuggling? He immediately replied without hesitation: at least 5,000 people. When I asked him for his basis, he said it was based on his feelings and contacts. Perhaps this fashionable young man who often pretends to be a “Hong Kong client” has listened to too many songs and brought out “Follow Your Feelings,” which is not credible. However, the numbers from the Luoyang Suburban Public Security Bureau’s anti-smuggling team are verifiable. This anti-smuggling team was established in July 1987, and by the end of 1988, they had handled more than 500 cases involving over 1,000 people. Luoyang City has 7 anti-smuggling teams and 1 cultural relics police station. According to general logical reasoning, Da Guozi’s estimate of 5,000 people is not groundless.

The temptation of smuggling and raiding artifacts is so great that it attracts many lawbreakers to engage in this criminal activity. Without listing their names, just listen to a few of their nicknames, and you will have a general idea of their level: Dog Egg, Black Face, Lai Dan, Na Er, Golden Monkey, Ha Ha, Yellow Hair, Big Mouth, Six Fingers… On this ancient land, there are traditional moral and ethical concepts. Thieves and robbers are despised and spat upon, and those who commit incest and adultery are despised by everyone. Even those who love to make small profits are despised as “chicken eggs,” but only tomb raiding does not arouse public anger, and tomb raiders even boast that this profession is “digging for food” – earning a living by strength. Thus, in this atmosphere, there is a man named Lü Shou, an artifact dealer, who openly shouts in broad daylight as he enters a village: “Buying antiques! Big horse 3,000, small horse 1,000, gold, silver, and jade, priced by quality!” Those who raid ancient tombs and buy artifacts are equally brazen. In broad daylight, they carry exploration shovels and dig east and west, as if they were farming. In Kongzhuang Village, Kongzhuang Township, the Kong brothers stole three ancient tombs in one go in Shanzhu Gorge, and no one stopped them. The suburban public security bureau’s anti-smuggling team arrived in a car, but they were blocked by the crowd for two hours and could not perform their duties…

An Invisible Yet Omnipresent Net and the Lawbreakers Who Break Through

The higher the magic, the higher the devil. Since those brazen lawbreakers dare to raid and smuggle artifacts in broad daylight, the law enforcement agencies of the People’s Republic cannot stand idly by!

Da Guozi was arrested this time by Guo Yong and his team in Xi’an. Why did he leave Luoyang to commit crimes in Xi’an? He said, “There are too many traps in Luoyang!”

In June 1987, a Macau client, Yuan Yaohong, used the pretext of doing car parts business to stay at the Luoyang Friendship Hotel and secretly engaged in artifact smuggling through his mistress. According to the time agreed upon by his mistress in the luxurious “10th Floor Dance Hall” with a certain artifact dealer, Yuan Yaohong arrived at a worker’s residence in the Xigong District on time. Almost simultaneously, a farmer-like person also entered the door, opened a woven bag, and took out a Tang Dynasty tri-colored figurine with a brilliant color. Yuan Yaohong’s eyes widened, and according to domestic standards, this figurine was enough to be classified as a first-class artifact! Just as the transaction was about to be completed, Guo Yong and his team also arrived at the scene in a timely manner. The daydream was shattered, and Yuan Yaohong was handcuffed and said, “I have heard in Macau that the suburban public security bureau in Luoyang is formidable, and now I have experienced it!”

In April 1988, the Guangdong clients Cai Fulian, Cai Guilian, and Cai Guangliang brought bodyguards and a large sum of money to Luoyang. On a moonlit night in early April, they gathered with six or seven local artifact dealers at Li’s house. Who would have thought that at the moment the goods and money were exchanged, two anti-smuggling team members from the Luoyang Suburban Public Security Bureau were also mingling among them?

Pang Zhenhua had been waiting at the exit of Baiyun Airport for a long time. A Boeing 747 jumbo jet finally roared and approached the apron, and the cabin door opened. Two passengers wearing sunglasses walked down the stairs. Pang Zhenhua received them and softly asked, “Have you brought the goods?” The two “sunglasses” nodded, and the car sped towards the city. The excitement of success made him a bit out of control: “Hey, follow me and do a good job! Don’t be afraid, everyone says the suburban public security bureau in Luoyang is formidable, but their Director Yang and Team Leader Guo are my friends…” The two “sunglasses” heard this and couldn’t help but smile at each other – Pang Zhenhua would never have dreamed that these two deliverymen were actually Director Yang and Team Leader Guo.

On this ancient land, “traps” seem to be everywhere; in the eyes of criminals, it is like coming to the foot of Mount Bagu, where everything is a soldier. A huge net has been opened, guarding our ancestors’ rich and precious cultural heritage, and is ready at any time to catch those who dare to take risks.

The flowers fall and the swallows return. Indeed, there are those who dare to test the law. Currently, in a prison in Shanxi, awaiting sentencing, is Bi Bingyong, one of them.

This is a notorious robber who was once identified by the public security bureau and entered the death list. In 1977, Bi Bingyong was sentenced to 15 years in prison for theft. During his imprisonment, he was sentenced to an additional 12 years for multiple escapes. In December 1986, he escaped again from a labor reform farm in Aksu, Xinjiang. In this bitterly cold season, he escaped north along a desolate path between the Taklamakan Desert and the Gobi Desert, avoiding capture and being identified as dead. This is a path of death, from which no one has ever returned alive, but he crossed the death zone… After wandering for a year, he suddenly flew from Urumqi to Zhengzhou by plane and entered Luoyang on November 26, 1987. In the following few months, he consecutively robbed three county and city museums: on March 12, 1988, he stole 28 artifacts from the Ru County Museum; then, he consecutively stole several artifacts from the Memorial Hall of the Eighth Route Army Office in Mianchi County; and then, on June 10, he infiltrated Pinglu County, Shanxi, and stole 30 valuable artifacts from the county museum that were about to be sent to Japan to participate in the Nara International Artifact Exhibition, becoming the nationwide “6.10 Artifact Theft Case.” Bi Bingyong’s consecutive crimes caused great difficulties for the public security bureau’s investigation work. After Bi Bingyong’s consecutive crimes, he hid in the mountain villages of the suburbs of Luoyang for nearly two months, rarely going out. In August, he finally came down the mountain, using the Jiu Long Restaurant and Huifeng Company in the suburbs as his “base,” organizing people to sell the stolen goods, and once even rented a small car from the Luoyang Municipal Foreign Affairs Office fleet, driving thousands of miles straight to Guangzhou.

The huge net was shaken. Almost as soon as Bi Bingyong began his series of criminal activities, the Luoyang Suburban Public Security Bureau’s anti-smuggling team noticed it and quickly spread the net. Except for a few ringleaders, Bi Bingyong’s outer circle was almost completely controlled, and soon, Guo Yong and his team discovered that these artifacts were not stolen from local ancient tombs but were museum collections. The situation was more complicated than they had initially imagined, so they reported to the municipal bureau while sending letters to neighboring provinces and cities. In less than a month, Guo Yong and his team, enduring the heat, went to Guangzhou several times and finally clarified the entire case. After three days and nights of ambush, they finally caught the cunning robber Bi Bingyong and solved three major cases!

The Director’s Complexion, the Team Leader’s Tears, and the Lawbreakers’ Arrogance

A friend from Shanghai told me that to determine the actual age of a southerner, you often have to add 10 years to the number you estimate for a northerner. If you reverse it, subtracting 10 years from the estimated number, that should be the actual age of a public security officer. The man standing in front of me, Deputy Director Yang Suijing, is the best example. When I interviewed him for the third time, he happened to be at the scene in Gucheng Township. The director’s face had a confident smile, but it couldn’t hide the fatigue and dullness, with dark circles under his eyes and a beard that was prickly, seeming to have aged even more since I first saw him. The temporary office at the scene had only one desk, one chair, and one bed. Behind the door, a large nylon net bag was hanging on a nail, filled with instant noodles in colorful plastic packaging. He was chewing on a piece of instant noodle – just like that, dry, as if eating. This man, who looked to be 50 years old, was actually only 36!

Later, I talked to Guo Yong about this with a heavy heart, and he said that this was the result of the irregular life of a criminal police officer. Even in the coldest days of winter, they have to go to the scene without rest after receiving a report. Once a case is taken on, sometimes it takes ten days or half a month, eating poorly and sleeping poorly, and when they return home, they are unrecognizable. Their criminal investigation team leader, Zhang Li, once returned home after completing a case, and his child called him “uncle.” I once asked Zhang Li in front of everyone if this was true? He blushed and shyly said, “The child was still small at that time.”

Once, I went to find Guo Yong (his home was on the third floor of the office), but his wife said, “It’s been three days, we haven’t seen him.” I met Shen Xianbin downstairs, and he said that Guo Yong had been working on a case all night and was now dozing off on the office sofa…

Indeed, the vast majority of public security officers live a life that is unimaginable to outsiders. Because their work is irregular, their biological clocks are completely disrupted, and almost every criminal police officer has varying degrees of stomach problems. In our lives, in our midst, there is such a group of unsung heroes who have been guarding an invisible front line for years, exchanging their youth and lives for the safety and happiness of the people. They should and have the right to be understood and respected!

On May 26, 1987, the State Council issued the “Notice on Cracking Down on Tomb Raiding and Artifact Smuggling,” and the next day, the Luoyang Suburban Public Security Bureau established the anti-smuggling team, with Guo Yong as the team leader, and Shen Xianbin, Xiao Jingzhou, Xu Lintao, and Wei Zhenli as four energetic young team members. The bureau was personally led by Deputy Director Yang Suijing. Their work was outstanding. In one and a half years, they solved more than 500 cases, recovered more than 600 artifacts, and confiscated more than 2 million yuan in illicit funds. The anti-smuggling team was collectively awarded a second-class merit citation, and Guo Yong was awarded a third-class merit citation.

The anti-smuggling team’s work cut off the criminals’ source of income, so the criminals tried every means to regain their lost paradise. These money-crazed people firmly believed that the God of Wealth could move heaven and earth, so they hid money in cigarette packs, calendars, and even in the returned artifacts. Some people sent intermediaries to plead, promising rewards. When Shen Xianbin went to arrest a criminal, the man immediately threw 5,000 yuan at him: “Brother, let me go today, and I will reward you handsomely!” In front of money, they were indeed red-faced heroes, but in front of personal relationships, they couldn’t take it. After a case, before they could catch their breath, people came to plead, making it impossible for them to eat or sleep, and their families were also disturbed. Guo Yong said that the most crucial problem for public security officers is nepotism and corruption, but those who dare to plead and bribe are often pushed out by the criminals from behind, their own beloved relatives. The more people came to plead, the more people they offended, and some relatives even broke off ties with them.

In addition to the resentment of relatives, those criminals who had been punished had deep hatred for Guo Yong and his team. A habitual tomb raider in Mapo Village openly boasted, “As long as Guo Yong is overthrown, Luoyang will be our world!” These people are heartless and ruthless. A recently released artifact smuggler immediately wrote a complaint letter, saying that Guo Yong had taken several million yuan from him. Because it was a complaint letter and the allegations were convincing, the leadership ordered an investigation, and Guo Yong had to be investigated. The suburban public security bureau was serious, and the case was quickly clarified – it turned out that the intermediary had eaten the “second meal.” The case was cleared, but the shadow fell into the depths of his heart. Such things did not happen to Guo Yong alone. One day, Guo Yong got drunk, and a 30-year-old man suddenly shed tears: “The leadership is responsible for me and trusts me. I am grateful. If someone accuses me once, I am investigated once, if ten times, ten times, what if one time is not cleared?” Although this hard man from Henan got drunk and cried, his heart was never confused. One night, we talked and were both moved. He said that some people engage in improper conduct, seriously damaging the image of the Party. As a member of the Communist Party, I will not bring even a little shame to the Party’s face. In addition to being responsible to the organization and the people, I also need to be responsible for my personal integrity.

We can’t stop here – the missing “epilogue” from the beginning of the article

My interview had to be temporarily suspended. When I said goodbye, I met Xu Lintao from the anti-smuggling team in the courtyard of the Luoyang Suburban Public Security Bureau.

Little Xu told me a joke that had just happened: A township police chief heard that Guo Yong had been arrested and asked if it was true, and he wanted to see Guo Yong in person before he would believe it and leave. It turned out that the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Security, had recently sent a working group to Luoyang to investigate a case of selling cars, and some lawbreakers who had been punished by the public security bureau for tomb raiding and artifact smuggling took the opportunity to spread rumors: “Guo Yong was arrested by the working group and taken to Beijing! They also searched his home and found X pounds of gold, X million US dollars, X million foreign exchange certificates, and a bag of old notes…”

I asked, “Does Guo Yong know?”

Little Xu said, “He is laughing with everyone in the office now!”

    盗墓走私者与他们的克星
    张若愚
   “3.15”笔者目击记——应是本文结尾，这里权做开篇
    由于洛阳市郊区公安局工作部署的原因，暂时不能安排我去古墓盗掘最严重的马坡村采访，于是，我只好带着极大的缺憾进行最后的一个活动项目——和几位年轻的缉私队员一齐登邙山，去实地感受一番。
    3月15日天气极好，艳阳高悬，蓝天如洗。缉私队长郭勇亲自驾车带着我们东出洛阳，绕开马坡，直奔金家沟，最后停在盘龙塚（村）——邙山之巅。今日之北邙，早已失却了古代诗文中的蓊郁葳蕤，处处袒裸着它那黄色的肌肤，除了一些帝王和显贵们的陵墓像小山头一样矗立，绝大多数古墓葬，已经因常年的雨水冲刷而失去了地面上的封土堆，星散在层层叠叠的梯田之下和崖畔沟壑之中。我无暇去发那“万冢不复识”“聚骨朽成泥”的怀古幽思，早已被眼前的狼藉情景震惊了。
    在盘龙塚至马沟村不足2公里的路上，坐在车里已经看到十几座古墓被盗后的情景，有的已经草草回填，不少连回填也还不曾。汽车停在盘龙塚村北一块不足10亩的梯田里，可以清清楚楚看到，密密麻麻的探洞纵横有序，排列整齐，洞与洞之间是标准距离——50厘米。据说，大凡经过这般“捣窝”的地方，就像用梳子篦过一样，地下的文物无一遗漏。劫后的古墓，盗洞黑森森地张着大口，汉唐时代的墓门砖被击碎后，随便丢弃在地面上，和许多黑陶碎片胡乱堆在一起。面对这一派凄惨与狼藉，谁也难以相信这是中国人自己对祖国文化遗产进行疯狂的掠夺与毁灭呵！
    汽车开进大里王村一所烧砖瓦的窑场，郭勇的本意，是让我看一下去年在这里破获的盗墓案的现场。如今，窑场已废弃，然而在旧盗洞的四周，却又排满了新打的探洞……
    窑场南边不远，是1958年开凿的邙山大渠。渠水在十几米深的断崖下滚滚流动，而渠对岸500米的麦田里，公然有人挥舞着探铲（又叫捣窠铲，一种专事掘墓的长柄铁铲）上下耸动，大概干得挺带劲，捣窝人脱得只剩下一身红秋衣，在夕阳中十分刺眼。也许是想探索一下能否横过大渠吧，同来的缉私队员许林涛悄悄攀援走下断崖。没有找到过渡的办法，当然无法鞭及对岸那目不旁鹜的捣窝者。然而，刚刚爬上来的小许，又带来另一则令人不快的消息：断崖下，又有一处汉墓被盗。我们一行五人谁都无言，因为大家正在注目对岸崖畔上的一处轮廓分明的新盗墓洞……
      古老的圣土以及畸形的职业
    在素有“九朝故都”之称的洛阳城的北面，有一条东西绵亘100多公里的山脉，虽称山，却不高不险，既不壮观也不嵯峨，然而鼎鼎有名，举世皆知。它的名字就叫邙山，古称北邙。
    从公元前770年起，先后有东周、东汉、曹魏、西晋、北魏、隋、唐、后梁和后唐诸朝在洛阳建都，长达1000年之久。古往今来，有多少王公贵族麇集在这片古老的土地上，已经无法统计，然而，汉唐两代洛阳成为拥有百万人口的大都市，却是有史可据的。
    在漫长的中世纪，人们头脑里充满着封建意识和宗教情绪，富贵者希冀荫及子孙，贫贱者渴望改变今世的命运，而这一切最后便凝聚在一个焦点上——死后葬进一块风水宝地。于是，南面巍巍伊阙、北带洋洋大河、景色幽丽土层深厚的邙山，便成了众望归一的圣土。随着岁月嬗递，北邙便成了我国古代著名的墓园。古民谣说：“邙山无卧牛之地！”可见邙山古墓之稠密了。
    人们既然把享乐寄托在虚无飘渺的来世和地下的天堂，那么，社会上必然出现厚葬的陋习。史载，汉文帝之子孝王刘武，死后随葬仅黄金一项即10万斤。奴婢家畜、庭院房屋乃至生活器皿，是不准或不便随葬的，便都以木、陶或金属物质做成模型放进墓中。至于庄园山林或者欢宴游猎的场面，只好画在墓壁上——随着时间的推移，这一切早已成为弥足珍贵的文物。
    厚葬陋习的起因原本就荒诞无稽，但它却因此而招来一些贪婪者的洗劫。公元191年，董卓兵败西窜，离开洛阳时，“使吕布发诸帝陵及公卿以下冢墓，收其珍宝”，是为开盗墓史之先河，以后此风历代绵延不绝。
    然而，最令人怵目惊心大规模的盗墓活动还在近代。1905年，陇海铁路汴洛段开工，线路横穿邙山南麓，毁坏了那里的古墓葬，出土许多珍贵文物，外籍技工和京沪古董商人竞相购求，引发了一场猖獗的盗墓之风。本来，邙山的水土流失就很严重，每逢山洪过后，一些古墓被冲刷暴露出来。那时，人们尚视随葬品为不祥之物，而古董商来了之后，观念开始发生急剧变化。每当大雨初歇，人们便带上钢锨四出逡巡，刨回古董出售。这种盗掘，似乎还有些守株待兔的意味，而实际上，这时的盗墓者早已汇成一支浩浩荡荡的职业大军了。1928年之后，从军阀混战到日伪时期，此风已经登峰造极。有人曾做过一番估计：到洛阳解放为止，这里约有5万座古墓被盗，出土文物50万件左右。这就难怪洛阳流传着“十墓九空”的民谚了。事实上，解放后文物工作者配合基本建设而进行的一系列考古发掘，也都证明了这一点。
    盗墓走私文物之风再起　大郭子的感觉以及胆大妄为之徒
    解放后，洛阳的盗墓活动确乎一度销声匿迹，然而到了“文革”后期，乃至1976年之后，却再度猖獗起来。实在说，在各种非法牟取暴利的罪恶勾当中，盗掘和走私文物是很有诱惑力的。一匹尺高的出土唐三彩马，在广州黑市可以卖到数十万元！况且，在“无卧牛之地”的邙山，盗掘古墓亦非难事。一个叫“赖娃”的青年农民，闲着无事，便约另两个农民，扛上捣窝铲，漫山遍野找古墓去了。从年龄到经验，干这行他们都嫩了点儿，甚至捣出的土也辨不准，还要请人来鉴定。结果呢，十天之内，连探带挖外加销赃，分别盗掘唐墓周墓各一座（其中还有一个盗过的“乏窝”），除了几件三彩，还有鼎、爵、尊等5件青铜器，获赃款4万元，各得1.3万元，平均日收入1300元。而那些经验十足的老劫墓贼，白日捣窝，卡准古墓的方位，晚间在地面上挖一个仅容肩宽的竖井（平面宽40——45厘米，长130——140厘米），直抵墓室，文物便可囊括无遗了。古墓如此之多，不义之财唾手可得，这就难怪盗墓者趋之若鹜了（这种冒险，有时也要付出高昂的代价。1986年，塔湾村两位农民便因墓中缺氧窒息而死）。无独有偶，在这股盗墓的恶浪中，前面提到的马坡、塔湾、北窑、盘龙冢、金家沟等，仍是盗墓人数最多的村庄，连10岁的孩子都会捣窝看土。
    与盗墓者同时孽生的，是文物走私贩子。这些人也有高低文野之分，有人直接充当“港客”的马仔，有人则充当“广客”的马仔。他们动辄住高级宾馆，乘豪华的士，一俟文物到手，即直
  飞广州，下机后，使用“BB机”，几分钟内即可找到老板，赃物脱手。这类人衣着考究，注意修饰，乍一见面，会误认为港澳同胞抑或大学教授什么的。有个叫大郭子的文物走私贩子，一派新潮打扮自不待言，还能说一口流利的粤语，身边带着小马仔，以港客身分坐镇高级宾馆。这两类人为数甚少，更多的则是三道、四道乃至不入流的贩子，一帮土佬，小跑堂的。他们大多本金短缺，靠从两头说合拉线，坑蒙拐骗赚取“手续费”。且莫小觑了这帮文物走私贩子，尽管他们文化层次不高，甚至很多是文盲，但就文物鉴定和断代等方面的知识而言，他们也能略知一二。否则，一件赝品到手，不去跳崖卧轨也得倾家荡产。
    在洛阳市郊区公安分局拘留所里，我询问过正在这里被收审的大郭子，洛阳参加盗掘和走私文物的大概有多少人？他不假思索便脱口而出：至少5000人。我问他有何根据，他说凭他的感觉和接触。也许，这位常以“港客”招摇过市的时髦青年“听歌”太多了，把《跟着感觉走》也冒了出来，所说不足为训。那么，洛阳市郊区公安分局缉私队的几个数字却是有案可查的。这个缉私队组建于1987年7月，到1988年底，共办案500多起，涉及人数1000人之多。洛阳市共有缉私队7个，文物派出所1个。按照一般的逻辑推理，大郭子5000人的估计，并非空穴来风。
    走私和盗掘文物有着如此的诱惑力，以至吸引了许多不法之徒从事这项犯罪活动。用不着列出他们的尊姓大名，且听一听这帮人的几个绰号，对他们的层次便会有一个概略印象了：狗蛋、黑脸、赖旦、孬儿、金猴、哈哈、黄毛、大嘴、六指儿……在这片古老的土地上，有着传统的道德与伦理观念，偷盗抢劫者被冠以“刀客”的恶名遭人唾弃，乱伦偷情为人所不齿，即便爱贪小利也受人蔑称“唧咕蛋”，唯独盗掘文物没有民愤，盗墓者也自诩这行当为“土里刨食儿”——凭力气吃饭。于是，在这种氛围里，就有一个叫吕寿的文物贩子，光天化日之下，进村便放开嗓门儿高声吆喝：“收古董的来喽——大马3000，小马1000，金银玉器，以质论价！”盗掘古墓者和收购文物者一样胆大妄为，众目睽睽之下，拿着探铲东捣西寻，犹如做庄稼活一样坦然，找到古墓，大白天就敢开挖。白马寺乡孔寨村孔氏二兄弟，在拦驾沟一连盗掘3座古墓，无人制止，郊区公安分局缉私队驾车赶到，竟遭众人阻拦2小时之久，不能执行公务……
    一面无形而又无处不在的网　以及从网外撞进来的亡命者
    道高一尺，魔高一丈。既然那些胆大妄为之徒敢于在光天化日之下盗掘和走私文物，共和国的专政机关岂能袖手旁观！
    大郭子这次收审，就是郭勇他们从西安市抓获的。他本是洛阳人，何以舍近求远去西安作案？他说，洛阳的“典”（洛阳口语，“陷阱”之意）忒多！
    1987年6月，澳门客袁耀雄以做汽车配件生意为名，住进洛阳友谊宾馆，通过他的姘妇暗中从事文物走私活动。按照姘妇在豪华的“十楼舞厅”与某文物贩子约好的时间，袁耀雄准时走进西工区一家工人住宅，几乎同时，一个农民模样的人也进了门，打开编织袋，拿出一尊色泽灿然如新的唐三彩文俑来。袁耀雄眼都直了，按照国内标准，这文俑够得上一级文物！就在这桩交易刚刚做成的当口，郭勇和他的队员也不失时机赶到现场。白日梦破灭了，袁犯带上冰冷的手铐时开口了：“早就在澳门听说洛阳郊区公安局厉害，果然领教了！”
    1988年4月，广客蔡福良、蔡桂良和蔡广良随身跟着保镖，携巨款来洛，当一个月白风清的夜晚，和六七个当地文物贩子会集在李某家中时，他们哪里想到，就在货款易手时，洛阳市郊区两名缉私队员也混迹其中呢？
    庞振华已经在白云机场出口处恭候多时了。一架波音747大型客机，呼啸着终于靠近停机坪，舱门打开，从舷梯走下两位戴太阳镜的乘客。庞振华接住他们，轻声问一句“货带到了吗？”两个“太阳镜”点了点头，轿车便飞速驶向市区。成功的兴奋，使他有些忘形：“喂，跟着我好好干！不用怕，都说洛阳郊区公安局厉害，可他们的杨局长和郭队长都是我的朋友……”两个“太阳镜”听了，不禁相视一笑——庞振华做梦也不会想到，这两个送货的正是杨局长和郭队长。
    在这片古老的土地上，“典”仿佛无所不在；在犯罪分子的眼中，犹如来到八公山下，草木皆兵。一张硕大无朋的网张开了，守护着我们的先民遗留下的丰富而又珍贵的文化财富，也随时准备着捕捉那些铤而走险的害人虫。
    扫地花更落，卷帘燕还来。敢于以身试法的亡命之徒果然有，眼下在山西某监狱等待判决的毕炳勇就是其中之一。
    这是一个曾被公安机关认定而载入死亡名单的江洋大盗。1977年，毕炳勇以盗窃罪被判处15年徒刑，服刑期间，因多次逃跑又被加刑12年。
  1986年12月，从新疆阿克苏某劳改农场再次逃跑。在这酷寒的季节里，他沿着塔克拉玛干大沙漠与戈壁滩之间一条渺无人迹的路线迎着朔风向北逃亡，从而逃避了追捕而被认定死亡。这是一条死亡之路，从来没有人活着出来，然而，他却穿越了死亡地带……辗转一年之后，又忽然从乌鲁木齐乘飞机直抵郑州，于1987年11月26日潜入洛阳，在以后短短的几个月的时间内，他一连盗窃三个县市的博物馆：1988年3月12日，他从汝州市博物馆一次盗走文物28件；之后，连续又盗走渑池县八路军办事处纪念馆文物数件；紧接着又于6月10日流窜到山西平陆县，穿窬而入，盗去该县博物馆即将赴日参加奈良国际文物博览会已经装箱的珍贵文物30件，成为轰动全国的“6.10文物失窃案”。毕炳勇的流窜作案，为公安机关的侦破工作造成了极大的困难。毕炳勇连续作案之后，便蛰伏在洛阳郊外的山村里，将近两个月深居简出。8月间，他终于下山，以郊区谷水镇的九龙餐厅和汇丰公司为“窝点”，组织人马，突击销赃，有一次竟租用了洛阳市外事办公室车队的小轿车，千里迢迢直奔广州。
    那张硕大无朋的网被撞动了。几乎就在毕犯这一系列犯罪活动一开始，洛阳市郊区公安局缉私队便窥见端倪，并迅速张开那张无形的大网。除了几个主犯，毕炳勇的外围几乎全部被控制了，很快，郭勇他们发现这批文物不是从当地古墓中盗掘的，而系馆藏文物。事情比他们最初想象的复杂多了，于是，一边上报市局，一边向邻近的省市发出电函。在不到一个月的时间里，郭勇和他的伙伴们冒着酷暑几下广州，终于查清了全部案情，经过三昼夜的埋伏，终于抓获了狡猾成性的江洋大盗毕炳勇，一举破获三件大案！
    公安局长的气色　缉私队长的眼泪不法之徒的气焰
    有位上海的朋友告诉我，要断定南方人的实际年龄，往往要在你们北方人估计的数字上再加上10岁。如果颠倒过来，把估计数字减去10岁，这就应该是公安干警的实际年龄了。站在我面前的杨遂庆副局长就是最好的证明。我第三次采访他时，正好赶上他在古城乡现场。局长的脸上挂着自信的笑容，但却掩不去疲惫的菜色，眼圈乌青，络腮胡子扎煞着，似乎比我初见时又老了许多。现场临时办公室只有一桌一椅一床，门后的钉子上，挂着一只大尼龙网兜，装满了彩塑纸包装的方便面。他正啃着一块方便面——就那么干嚼着，算是吃饭。这位看去50岁的汉子，实际年龄才只有36岁！
    后来，我不无心酸地和郭勇谈及此事，他说，这是刑事警察长期无规律的生活造成的。哪怕是三九寒天，接到报案也得不舍昼夜去现场。上了案子，有时一搞就是十天半月，吃不好也睡不好，回到家来人都脱形了。他们刑警队的指导员张力，一次办完案子回家，孩子见了直喊“叔叔”。我曾当着众人问过张力，是否确有此事？他脸红了，腼腆地说：“那会儿孩子还小。”
    有一次我去找郭勇（他家就在办公室的三楼上），可他爱人说：“都三天了，没见过人影儿。”我下楼遇见沈献斌，他说，郭勇为一个案子折腾了一夜，此刻还在办公室沙发上眯着呢……
      的确，广大的公安干警就是经常过着令局外人不可思议的生活。因为工作没规律，体内的生物钟全部紊乱，几乎每一个做刑事警察的都有着轻重不等的胃病。在我们的生活中，在我们的身边，就是有这么一批默默无闻的人，常年守卫在一条看不见的战线上，用自己的青春与生命换来广大人民的安全与幸福，他们应该而且有权得到理解与尊敬！
    1987年5月26日，国务院下达
  《关于打击盗掘和走私文物活动的通告》，时隔一天，洛阳市郊区公安分局就成立了缉私队，郭勇任队长，还有沈献斌、肖景洲、许林涛和魏震力四名生龙活虎般的青年队员，局里由杨遂庆副局长亲自领导。他们的工作是出色的。建队一年半，破案500多起，追回文物600多件，罚得赃款200多万元，缉私队集体荣膺二等功一次，郭勇立三等功一次。
    缉私队的工作割断了犯罪分子的财源，犯罪分子便千方百计地想寻回失去的天堂。这些财迷心窍的家伙，深信赵公元帅可以感天动地，于是，香烟盒里、年历里甚至退赃的文物里，都夹带着数量可观的现金。有些则托人说项，许诺开价。沈献斌去抓一个罪犯时，那家伙当场就甩过来5000元：“兄弟今天放我一马，回来另有厚报！”在金钱面前，他们不愧为红脸硬汉，可在人情面前，真让他们受不了。一个案子下来，还没喘口气，说情人便接踵而来，搞得你饭吃不成，觉睡不成，一家人也跟着不得安宁。郭勇说，干公安的最要害的问题是徇私枉法，可是，敢于说情行贿的，往往是被案犯从背后推出来的自家的至爱亲朋。越是说客盈门，他们得罪的人越多，有些亲友甚至为此反目，断绝来往。
    除了亲朋的怨怼，那些被制裁过的犯罪分子，对于郭勇他们则是刻骨的仇恨了。马坡村一个盗掘古墓的惯犯公开扬言：“只要扳倒郭勇，洛阳就是我们的天下！”这帮人心黑，手也辣。一个文物走私犯刚迈出狱门就写信告状，说郭勇吃了他几万元。因为是告状信，且又言之凿凿，领导批示立案，郭勇就得接受审查。郊区公安分局是严肃认真的，案情很快就弄清了——原来是说情人在中间吃了“二馍”。案情昭雪了，阴影却投进心灵深处。像这样的事，也决不止光临郭勇一个人。有一天，郭勇喝醉了酒，30岁的一条汉子，忽然流了泪：“领导对我负责，信任，我感谢。别人告一次，查清一次，告十次查清十次，万一有一次查不清呢？”尽管这位豫西硬汉醉过酒，流过泪，但他的一颗心却从不迷惘。一天深夜，我们聊得都动了情。他说，有些人搞不正之风，严重地损害了党的形象。做为一名共产党员，我决不给党的脸上抹一点黑。除了对组织、对人民负责，我还要对个人的人格负责。
    还不能打住——本文开篇中遗漏的“尾声”
    我的采访只得暂告结束。当我告别时，在洛阳市郊区公安分局的院子里遇上了缉私队的许林涛。
  小许告诉我一则刚刚发生的“笑话”：某乡派出所长听说郭勇被捕，问他确否，而且要亲自看见郭勇才相信才肯离去。原来，中央监察部会同公安部近期联合派出工作组，到洛阳市查处一起倒卖汽车案，一些曾因盗掘和走私文物受到公安机关制裁过的不法分子，便乘机造谣惑众：“郭勇被工作组抓到北京去了！还在他家搜出黄金×斤，美元×万元，外汇券××万元，光老头票就一布袋……”
    我问：“郭勇知道了吗？”
    小许说：“他这会正跟大伙在办公室里笑呢！”
