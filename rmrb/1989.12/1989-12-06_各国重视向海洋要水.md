The world's water resources include oceans, glaciers, rivers, lakes, marshes, groundwater, soil water, and atmospheric water, forming a complete water system with a total volume of approximately 1.4 billion cubic kilometers. However, 97% of these water resources are seawater, which cannot be directly used by humans. Freshwater resources account for only about 3%. Moreover, the distribution of existing freshwater resources is highly uneven, with some regions and countries facing severe water shortages.

How can the problem of water scarcity facing humanity be solved? In addition to focusing on conservation, comprehensive utilization, and the development of groundwater, many countries are exploring the development of new resources. Scientists have proposed the idea of utilizing Antarctic glaciers. The freshwater resources in Antarctica are indeed abundant and unpolluted, but due to the long distance and enormous cost, this remains only a concept and cannot be realized. Additionally, some countries have made significant progress in desalinating seawater.

In the past 20 years, the seawater desalination industry in some countries has developed rapidly. In 1977, the global daily desalinated water volume was only 4 million cubic meters. By 1980, this had increased to 8 million cubic meters, and it is currently estimated to have exceeded 10 million cubic meters. The number of desalination plants built and under construction was 2,200 in 1980, and it is currently estimated to be close to 3,000. These desalinated waters are used 50% for urban living, 48% for industry, and 2% for military and tourism purposes, playing a significant role in alleviating the water crisis.

The Gulf country of Kuwait faces severe water shortages. Two spherical water towers built in the capital, Kuwait City, are used primarily for water storage, essentially solving the residents' water supply problem. In 1975, Japan used seawater for industrial cooling, accounting for 45% of the total industrial water usage. Many other countries are also conducting research to better utilize seawater.

    各国重视向海洋要水
    余洋
    世界上的水资源包括海洋、冰川、河流、湖泊、沼泽、地下水、土壤水、大气水所形成的完整水系，总储水量约14亿立方公里。但是，由于水资源的97％是海水，不能为人类直接利用。淡水资源仅占约3％。而且现有的淡水资源分布又极不均衡，一些地区和国家严重缺水。
    如何解决人类面临的缺水问题？不少国家除注意节约、综合利用、开发地下水外，已在探索开发新资源。科学家曾提出利用南极冰川的设想。南极淡水资源的确十分丰富，而且未受污染，但由于路途遥远，耗资巨大，所以目前还只能是一个设想，不可能变为现实。另外，有一些国家在淡化海水方面已取得一定成就。
    近20年来，一些国家的海水淡化事业发展很快，1977年，全球日淡化水量不过400万立方米，1980年增加到800万立方米，目前估计已超过1000万立方米。已建成和在建的淡化工厂，1980年有2200余座，目前估计已接近3000座。这些淡化水50％用于城市生活用水，48％用于工业，2％供军用和旅游，对于缓解水危机起了相当大的作用。
    海湾国家科威特严重缺水，首都科威特城修建的两座球形水塔专供储水之用，基本上解决了居民用水问题。日本1975年用于工业冷却的海水已占到全部工业用水的45％。其他不少国家也在为更好地利用海水进行研究。
