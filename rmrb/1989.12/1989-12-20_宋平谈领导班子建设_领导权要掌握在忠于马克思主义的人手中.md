Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, stressed today that we must adhere to Marxism and the socialist direction. The key is to build our party well and build the leadership teams at all levels well, so that the leadership is firmly in the hands of those who are loyal to Marxism.

It is understood that next year, 12 provinces and autonomous regions will have party committees that need to be replaced, a considerable number of county and city party committees, and almost all county-level people's congresses will also need to be replaced. For this reason, the Organization Department started a special training class on December 4, with participants including the heads of the organization departments of 18 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

This morning, Song Ping had a discussion with the participants of the training class on how to build good leadership teams in accordance with the basic line of the party.

During the discussion, the heads of the organization departments of Jiangxi, Jilin, Ningxia, and Hubei, Lu Xiuzhen, Tan Jinghe, Xue Weitang, and Ye Cunwu, expressed their opinions on the requirements for strengthening the construction of leadership teams, the ideological and work style construction of leadership teams, the selection and cultivation of party and government leaders, and local elections.

Song Ping pointed out in his speech that in the current complex domestic and international situation, we must be sober-minded and strive to strengthen the party's own construction. We must firmly believe in historical materialism and believe that socialism will ultimately achieve victory.

Song Ping said that to build the party well, the most important thing is to have a correct line. We must unswervingly implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and at the same time, we must build the organizations of the party at all levels, especially the leadership teams at all levels. He proposed that the leadership teams must consistently adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and oppose bourgeois liberalization. This is the most basic political quality of the leadership teams. To achieve this, first, leading cadres at all levels must strengthen their study of Marxist basic theories and improve their theoretical qualities; second, those who are politically strong, have a spirit of innovation, are daring in reform, seek truth from facts, maintain close ties with the masses, and are good at uniting comrades must be selected into the leadership teams.

Song Ping emphasized the importance of cadres maintaining close ties with the masses in his speech. He said that maintaining close ties with the masses is a fine tradition of our party and the source of our party's strength. In recent years, our party's fighting capacity has been weakened, and one important reason is that our party has, in some aspects, become detached from the masses. If the Communist Party becomes detached from the masses, it will inevitably produce subjectivism and bureaucratism and will lose the trust and support of the masses. All party members must have a sufficient and sober understanding of the seriousness of this problem. He said that there are many ways for cadres to maintain close ties with the masses, such as frequently going to workers, peasants, intellectuals, and young students to talk heart-to-heart, make friends, and listen to their opinions. Leading cadres should establish fixed work contact points at the grassroots level and directly handle important letters and visits. The organization departments should seriously study this, propose measures, make regulations, and turn cadres going to the grassroots and maintaining close ties with the masses into an institution.

Song Ping pointed out that our party is the core force leading the socialist cause and has led the Chinese people to create immortal achievements. This is indisputable. We must resolutely safeguard the glorious image of the party, actively publicize the model figures among Communist Party members, and publicize their advanced deeds to set examples for people to learn from. We must not tolerate or indulge in any negative and corrupt phenomena within the party and must resolutely fight against them.

When talking about the unity of the leadership teams, Song Ping said that the unity of the leadership teams is very important. To strengthen unity, we must rely on the regular ideological education within the teams, rely on the healthy democratic life within the party, implement democratic centralism, carry out criticism and self-criticism, accept the supervision of the masses, and enhance the cohesion and fighting capacity of the leadership teams.

Today's discussion was chaired by Liu Feng, deputy minister of the Organization Department, and Liu Ze Peng, another deputy minister, also attended the meeting.

    宋平谈领导班子建设
    领导权要掌握在忠于马克思主义的人手中
    新华社北京12月19日电（记者何平）中共中央政治局常委、中组部部长宋平今天在这里强调，坚持马克思主义，坚持社会主义方向，关键是要把我们这个党建设好，把各级领导班子建设好，使领导权牢牢掌握在忠于马克思主义的人手中。
    据了解，明年全国有12个省、自治区的党委要换届，相当一部分县市的党委和绝大多数县级人大也要换届。为此，中组部于12月4日起举办有18个省、自治区和市的党委组织部负责人参加的专题研究班。
    今天上午，宋平同研究班的同志就如何按照党的基本路线的要求建设好领导班子问题进行了座谈。
    座谈会上，江西、吉林、宁夏、湖北的组织部负责人卢秀珍、谭景和、薛维堂、叶存武，先后就加强领导班子建设的要求、领导班子思想作风建设、党政主要负责干部的选拔培养、地方换届选举等问题，发表了意见。
    宋平在讲话中指出，在当前国内外的复杂形势下，我们必须头脑清醒，奋发图强，加强党的自身建设。我们要坚定历史唯物主义的信念，坚信社会主义必将取得最终的胜利。
    宋平说，要把党建设好，最重要的是有一条正确的路线。我们要坚定不移地贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，同时，要把各级党的组织，特别是各级领导班子建设好。他提出，领导班子必须始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，反对资产阶级自由化，这是领导班子最基本的政治素质。要做到这一点，一是各级领导干部要加强对马克思主义基本理论的学习，提高理论素质；二是要把那些政治上强，有开拓进取精神，勇于改革，实事求是，密切联系群众，善于团结同志的人选拔进领导班子。
    宋平在讲话中强调了干部联系群众的重要性，他说，密切联系群众是我们党的优良传统，也是我们党的力量之所在。这几年我们党的战斗力受到削弱，一个重要原因就是因为我们党在一些方面脱离了群众。共产党如果脱离了群众，势必会产生主观主义、官僚主义，就会失去群众的信赖和支持。全党同志对这一问题的严重性要有足够的、清醒的认识。他说，干部联系群众的方式很多，比如经常深入到工人、农民、知识分子和青年学生中去，同他们谈心、交朋友，听取他们的意见，领导干部要在基层建立固定工作联系点，直接处理重要的来信来访等等。对此，组织部门要认真研究，提出措施，作出规定，使干部下基层、联系群众形成制度。
    宋平指出，我们党是领导社会主义事业的核心力量，带领中国人民创造了不朽的业绩，这是不容怀疑的。我们必须坚决维护党的光辉形象，要大力宣传共产党员中的模范人物，宣传他们的先进事迹，为人们树立学习的榜样。对党内存在的某些消极、腐败现象，绝不能容忍、迁就，必须进行坚决斗争。
    在谈到领导班子的团结问题时，宋平说，领导班子的团结是非常重要的。要加强团结，就要靠班子内部经常性的思想教育，要靠健全党内正常的民主生活，实行民主集中制，开展批评与自我批评，接受群众监督，增强领导班子的凝聚力和战斗力。
    今天的座谈会由中组部副部长吕枫主持，中组部副部长刘泽彭也出席了会议。
