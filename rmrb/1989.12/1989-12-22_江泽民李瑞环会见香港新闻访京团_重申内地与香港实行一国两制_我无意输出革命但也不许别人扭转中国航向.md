Jiang Zemin and Li Ruihuan Meet with Hong Kong Journalists Visiting Beijing
Reaffirm One Country, Two Systems for Mainland and Hong Kong
We Do Not Intend to Export Revolution, But We Will Not Allow Others to Alter China's Course

BEIJING, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin and CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan met this afternoon in Zhongnanhai with a delegation of Hong Kong journalists visiting Beijing, led by Yang Qi, president of the *Ta Kung Pao*.

Jiang Zemin briefed the guests on the political and economic situation in the mainland and discussed China's foreign relations and views on some international issues.

He said, "China will adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in developing friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, including capitalist countries. 'We do not intend to export revolution, but we will not allow others to alter our course.'"

Regarding Sino-U.S. relations, he said, "China and the United States should seek common ground while reserving differences. As long as both sides are sincere in doing so, the prospects for cooperation will be broad."

He reaffirmed that after 1997, the mainland and Hong Kong will implement the "one country, two systems" policy. "You pursue your capitalism, and we pursue our socialism. 'The well water does not interfere with the river water, and the river water does not interfere with the well water.'"

He said that the domestic political situation of stability and unity is increasingly consolidated, and economic rectification and adjustment have achieved results. This year's agricultural harvest is good, and industrial development speed has been appropriately controlled.

Jiang Zemin said, "No matter how international situations change, China's reform and opening-up policy will not change. China will definitely continue on the socialist course."

Li Ruihuan explained to the guests the mutual relationship between political system reform and economic system reform.

Relevant department heads Zhu Muzhi, Li Hou, and Zeng Jianhui attended the meeting.

Yesterday evening, Jia Qinglin, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, met and hosted a banquet for the Hong Kong guests at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

The visiting delegation consists of executives from eight Hong Kong newspapers.
