As the weather turns colder, many agricultural water conservancy construction sites in Sichuan are bustling with activity, a scene rarely seen in recent years. According to statistics from the end of October, the province has mobilized 11.95 million laborers. They have transformed 350,000 mu of low-yield fields, completed a large number of water conservancy projects, increased and restored 326,000 mu of irrigated land, treated 213,000 mu of soil erosion, and planted 1.219 million mu of forests in patches.

This year, Sichuan has experienced several natural disasters, including floods, hailstorms, and earthquakes, which have damaged many agricultural water conservancy facilities. Since the beginning of winter, most areas in the province have established command organizations for agricultural water conservancy construction, led by the main leaders of the party and government. In 42 counties focusing on land improvement and soil transformation in the central Sichuan hills and 20 counties initiating the construction of the Yangtze River protection forest, project offices have been universally set up. Various places are investing heavily in agricultural water conservancy construction, increasing financial input and raising funds from the public. Leshan City has invested 24 million yuan, with half of it from public fundraising. Chengdu City has invested 10.12 million yuan in transforming low-yield fields, double the amount from last year, and 25 million yuan in water conservancy projects, a 41.3% increase from last year.

In the province-wide agricultural water conservancy construction campaign, each area focuses on its actual conditions, determines the main direction, emphasizes practical benefits, and implements comprehensive treatment. The eastern, western, and southern parts of Sichuan focus on repairing water-damaged projects, while other areas focus on improvement and matching. Chengdu City, in its main effort to transform low-yield waterlogged fields, has dug 1,092 ditches totaling 102.8 kilometers. Suining City has mobilized a large number of people to invest in three major agricultural projects focusing on land improvement, soil erosion treatment, and Yangtze River protection forest construction, achieving remarkable results.

    四川修农田水利重实效
    投资投劳超过以往  各地都有主攻方向
    本报成都12月3日电　记者罗茂城报道：时下天气逐渐寒冷，但四川的许多农田水利建设工地却热气腾腾，出现了近几年少见的可喜景象。据10月底的统计，全省上阵劳力达1195万人，改造低产田土35万多亩，完成一大批水利工程，新增和恢复灌溉面积32.6万亩，治理水土流失面积21.3万亩，还成片造林121.9万亩。
    四川今年先后遇到洪涝、风雹、地震等自然灾害的袭击，农田水利设施多处遭到破坏。入冬以来，全省各地多数成立了由党政主要领导挂帅的农田水利基本建设指挥机构。川中丘陵42个改田改土项目县和20个长江防护林建设启动县，普遍成立了项目办公室。各地对农田水利基本建设舍得下本钱，既增加财政投入，又向群众广泛集资。乐山市投入资金2400万元，集资占一半。成都市改造低产田土投资1012万元，比去年增一倍，水利工程投资2500万元，比去年增加41.3％。
    在全省掀起农田水利建设热潮中，各地注意根据当地实际，确定主攻方向，注重实际效益，实行综合治理。川东、川西、川南以修复水毁工程为主，其余地区以整治、配套为主。成都市在主攻低产下湿田方面，已开沟1092条，总长102.8公里。遂宁市则出动千军万马，投入以改田改土、水土流失治理、长江防护林建设为重点的三大农业工程，取得可喜成果。
