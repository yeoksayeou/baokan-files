This year, the market has undergone significant changes, with the total retail sales of social commodities declining month by month and inventory levels continuously increasing. Various opinions have emerged regarding this situation. Some argue that there is an accumulation of excess inventory, while others claim that there is still a shortage. The question remains: is there too much or too little? We will provide an analysis below.

Firstly, the increase in commodity inventory is primarily influenced by price factors. As of October this year, the inventory of social commercial commodities increased by 21.6% compared to the same period last year. However, during the same period, the estimated overall retail price index for the society was above 21%. After adjusting for price factors, the actual growth was 0.5%, which is roughly the same as the same period last year.

Secondly, in previous years, there was a continuous surge in consumer demand, leading to a significant gap between supply and demand. Commodity inventories were relatively low, with some even falling below reasonable limits. In particular, last year, due to several waves of commodity panic buying across the country, the total inventory of social commodities, after adjusting for price factors, decreased by 1.3%, and the base was also relatively low.

Thirdly, the total inventory of commodities does not match the market's monetary circulation. As of the end of October, the market's monetary circulation was 2118 billion yuan. The ratio of the total inventory of commodities to the monetary circulation (not the average circulation) was 1.52:1. In the same period last year, the ratio between the two was 1.37:1. Even if we include the inventory of finished products from the light textile industry, the ratio is only 1.7:1, with a slight increase in the inventory ratio, but still lower than the 4:1 ratio seen in most years.

Fourthly, compared to the surplus purchasing power, the inventory is even more insufficient. As of the end of October, the cumulative surplus purchasing power in society was approximately 6600 billion yuan. The ratio of commodity inventory to surplus purchasing power was 0.48:1. If we include the inventory of finished products from the light textile industry, the ratio between the two is only 0.55:1, slightly higher than the 0.51:1 ratio seen in the same period last year, but still far from 1:1.

Fifthly, from the perspective of inventory structure, it is also irrational. There is still a significant gap in the supply and demand of important commodities such as grain, cotton, oil, sugar, refined oil, and fertilizers, which are crucial for the national economy and people's livelihood. Although the inventory of cotton fabrics and synthetic fabrics, which were originally in short supply, has increased, it still falls short of the reasonable inventory requirements. High-end durable consumer goods such as refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, tape recorders, sewing machines, and bicycles, which were the most panic-bought last year, also have relatively low inventories, with an increase of 20-70% this year. However, there are indeed some low-quality, high-priced, and mismatched commodities. Although these commodities have increased, they cannot solve the problem of effective supply. Additionally, some commodities have increased due to excessive blind production and reduced sales, as well as controls in our sales.

The above situation indicates that, under the condition that the contradiction between total demand and total supply has not been further alleviated, the inventory of commodities has shown a relatively high phenomenon. This is a good sign that the economic adjustment and rectification have made the national economy more stable.

### 商品库存论是非

    商品库存论是非
    今年以来，市场发生了很大变化，社会商品零售总额逐月下降，商品库存不断增加。对此，各方面议论较多。有的说出现了积压，有的说仍然不足。究竟是多是少，我们现作如下分析。
    一是商品库存增加基本上是价格因素的影响。今年10月末社会商业商品库存比去年同期增长21.6％，而同期全社会零售物价指数估计在21％以上，扣除价格因素，实际增长0.5％，与去年同期基本持平。
    二是前几年连续出现消费热，商品供需缺口较大，商品库存比较薄弱。有些商品库存已下降到合理限度以下，特别是去年，由于全国出现了数次商品抢购高潮，社会商品库存总额扣除物价因素下降1.3％，基数也较低。
    三是商品库存总额与市场货币流通量也不相适应。10月末，市场货币流通量为2118亿元，商品库存总额与货币流通量（非平均流通量）之比为1.52∶1，去年同期二者之比为1.37∶1，如果加上轻纺工业产成品库存，也只有1.7∶1，库存比例略有提高，但均低于大多数年份4∶1的比例。
    四是与结余购买力相比更显不足。10月末，社会累计结余购买力约达6600亿元，商品库存与结余购买力之比为0.48∶1，若加上轻纺工业产成品库存，二者之比也仅为0.55∶1，只略高于去年同期的0.51∶1，但都不到1∶1。
    五是从库存结构看，也是不合理的。一些关系国计民生的粮、棉、油、糖、成品油、化肥等重要商品供需缺口仍然较大。原本不足的棉布、化纤布等库存虽有增加，但也低于合理库存的需要，而高档耐用消费品如电冰箱、洗衣机、电视机、录音机、缝纫机、自行车等去年抢购最多，库存也较薄弱，今年增幅在20—70％。但确有一些质次价高、货不对路的商品，这类商品虽有增加，但不能解决有效供给问题。另外，一些商品之所以多一些，有的是盲目生产过多而销量下降，也有我们销售上控制的原因。
    上述情况表明，在总需求与总供给的矛盾尚未进一步缓解的情况下，商品库存出现了相对较多的现象。是治理整顿使国民经济趋于稳定的好势头。
