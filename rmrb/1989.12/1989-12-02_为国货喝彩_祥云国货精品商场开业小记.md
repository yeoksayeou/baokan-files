**Cheering for Domestic Goods – A Record of the Opening of Xiangyun Domestic Goods Boutique Mall**

**By Liu Guilian, People's Daily Reporter**

On December 1, 1989, the bustling streets of Beijing's Xidan were more lively than usual. The entrance of the Xiangyun Domestic Goods Boutique Mall was adorned with fluttering flags and filled with the sound of music, attracting a crowd of people. The mall was scheduled to open at 10 AM, but people had gathered early to await the moment.

The newly decorated mall welcomed its first batch of customers today, including shoppers, factory representatives, government officials, journalists, and businesspeople interested in domestic goods. The 1,200 square meter shopping area featured 5,000 products from all over the country, each one unique and eye-catching. There were familiar items from Beijing and Shanghai, such as blankets, cosmetics, and wool sweaters, as well as products from other regions like paper from the Masongli Paper Factory, clothing from brands like Lanbird, Cardin, and Meiwei, and even items from Shashi, Luoyang, Baotou, Guangdong, and Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Xiangyun Company General Manager Wang Yunfei was particularly excited and busy today. When asked about the meaning of "boutique," he explained that domestic boutique goods refer to products made in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, bearing Chinese trademarks, and representing the advanced level of domestic production. The mall naturally features national and department-level quality products and some well-known brands, but it also showcases high-quality products that are less known to the public. The general manager proudly declared that the purpose of establishing this store is to showcase the level of domestic goods, promote the trend of using domestic goods with pride, and contribute to the development of domestic goods. For example, the Lishen coffee from Hainan Island is China's first instant coffee. Lishen has top-notch raw materials and technology, producing first-class products. However, with economic giants like Nestlé and Maxwell's spending $2 million on advertising in China, how can the newly born Lishen compete? The Xiangyun Domestic Goods Boutique Mall aims to introduce such domestic boutique goods to a wider audience.

The well-dressed and well-trained sales staff greeted customers with smiles and nods. They were selected from over 1,000 applicants. They told the reporter that they were very willing to work in the domestic goods mall and would provide high-quality service to enhance the reputation of domestic boutique goods. Two elderly people with white hair pointed to the mall's decorations, layout, and the shelves full of domestic goods, happily telling the reporter, "All are domestic goods, such good domestic goods, the store is decorated with character, it makes one feel good inside." Another said, "Gathering so many high-quality domestic goods together, it makes one feel proud. This store is well done."

Minister of Commerce Hu Ping and Deputy Minister of Light Industry Xiao Yongding cut the ribbon for the mall and lingered, unwilling to leave. Deputy Minister Xiao walked from the first floor to the fourth, often stopping at the counters to carefully observe. He told the reporter that Xiangyun Company had done something very meaningful, setting a good example. The Ministry of Light Industry fully supports this. Of course, the best support is for light industry enterprises to produce more and better products. He also said that so many people came today, making it so lively, showing that everyone cares about domestic goods. By working together, commerce and industry can make domestic goods famous.

    为国货喝彩
    ——祥云国货精品商场开业小记
    本报记者　刘桂莲
    1989年12月1日，繁华的北京西单大街，比往日更显热闹。祥云国货精品商场的门前彩旗飘扬，乐声回荡，围满了人群。上午十点钟开业剪彩，人们却早早地聚在这里等待。
    装饰一新的商场，今天迎来的第一批客人，既有购物的顾客，也有厂家、政府工作人员、新闻记者和关心国货商店的经济界人士。1200平方米的营业面积，汇集了来自全国各地的5000种商品，争鲜耀眼，琳琅满目。这里有人们熟悉的北京、上海的毛毯、化妆品、羊毛衫，有马胜利造纸厂的纸制品，有蓝鸟、卡地亚、美而美牌服装，也有北京人不熟悉的沙市暖瓶、洛阳无开关触摸台灯、包头的印花羊皮领带、广东小榄永利高级运动鞋和香港、台湾的塑料制品……
    祥云公司总经理王云飞今天特别高兴，跑前跑后，也特别忙碌。他回答人们“精品”的含意说：国货精品是指在大陆、港澳、台湾生产、使用中国商标、代表国内先进水平的商品。这里自然有国优、部优产品及一些名牌俏货，但也有人们还不熟知的实际上质量很高的产品。总经理自豪地宣称，发起办这个商店，目的在于展示国货的水平，促成以用国货为荣的时尚，也要起促进国货发展的作用。比如海南岛的力神咖啡，是我国第一家速溶咖啡，“力神”有一流的原料和工艺，生产出一流的产品，但经济实力雄厚的雀巢、麦士咖啡，在中国已花去200万美元做广告，刚刚诞生的“力神”，如何竞争？祥云国货精品商场就是要把类似力神这样的国货精品，介绍给广大消费者。
    穿着整齐、训练有素的售货员，面带微笑，不时向前来的人们轻轻点头。他们是从1000多名报名应聘者中选拔出来的。他们告诉记者，非常愿意在国货商场工作，要以高质量的服务为国货精品添彩。两位满头白发的老年人，一位指着商店的装饰、布局和满货架的国货，高兴地告诉记者：“都是国货，都是国货，这么好的国货，商店布置又有特色，看了心里舒服。”另一位说：“把这么多优质国货集中到一起，让人看了真有一种自豪感，这样的商店办得好。”
    商业部长胡平、轻工部副部长肖永定，为商场剪彩后，留连不去。肖副部长从一楼到四楼，常驻足柜台前细细观察。他告诉记者说，祥云公司做了一件很有意义的事，开了个好头，轻工部全力支持。当然最好的支持，就是轻工企业要拿出更多更好的产品。他还说，今天来了这么多人，这么热闹，说明大家都很关心国货。工商携起手来，让国货名声大振。
