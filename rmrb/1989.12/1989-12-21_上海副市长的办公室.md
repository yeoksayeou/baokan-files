Title: The Office of Shanghai's Deputy Mayors

Who would have thought that within the beautiful group of "Western-style buildings" on the Bund in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government building, seven deputy mayors would share just three offices?

The reporter arrived at the deputy mayors' office area and was first struck by the sight of three secretaries crammed into a narrow room of less than fifteen square meters. Various documents filled the room, almost to the brim. The three telephones on each secretary's desk were particularly puzzling: what if all nine telephones rang at once? What if the three secretaries answered the phones simultaneously? The secretaries seemed to have long since grown accustomed to this, saying, "Each person just listens to their own."

The situation in the other secretary's room was basically the same.

Entering the three connected offices of the deputy mayors, Xie Lijuan, who was working at her desk, quickly stood up to introduce: the outer office is used by Gu Chuantun and Ni Hongfu (who was transferred to the position of deputy secretary of the municipal party committee half a month ago); the middle office is used by Huang Ju, Liu Zhenyuan, and herself; the inner office is used by Zhuang Xiaotian and Ni Tianzeng.

It is said that the seven deputy mayors of the previous term also used the same office layout.

Looking at these three offices, they are naturally more spacious and elegant compared to the secretaries' rooms. There are wall hangings and small crafts, and the documents and books are neatly arranged on each deputy mayor's desk and a small bookshelf. In addition to the three telephones corresponding to the secretaries, each deputy mayor's desk also has a potted plant. The vibrant "one-red" flowers, the golden chrysanthemums and purple chrysanthemums blooming together but still tightly clustered, seem to hint at the interests and pursuits of the desk owners.

Unfortunately, on that day, only two of the seven deputy mayors were in their offices, so we couldn't see the lively scene when they work together.

After we sat down in Xie Lijuan's office, we asked, "Do three deputy mayors working in one office cause a lot of interference?"

"Our cooperation is very good," she replied without hesitation.

This office is slightly larger than the other two, so there is a long conference table and several chairs in the middle. Xie Lijuan pointed to the conference table and said, "Sometimes, the staff from the departments managed by a deputy mayor need to hold a meeting here, and the other two deputy mayors have to go elsewhere to 'fight a guerrilla war' to handle documents. Sometimes, all three deputy mayors receive visitors at the same time, and everyone pays attention to speaking softly and talking quietly."

I asked Deputy Mayor Gu Chuantun, who came from the next office, about his feelings, and he also thought it was very normal and natural. He said, "I am in charge of industry, and Ni Hongfu is in charge of agriculture. He goes to the countryside for a day, and I go to the factory for half a day. We interfere with each other less. We also try not to let the grassroots comrades come to the municipal government office to discuss work, but rather to go to the grassroots more to solve problems ourselves."

Is it that the Shanghai Municipal Government cannot afford to build an office building? No.

In the past ten years, Shanghai has averaged an annual net contribution to the central government of about 13.2 billion yuan, building nearly 40 million square meters of residential housing, successively building more than ten residential communities, and also newly building a railway station, expanding an airport, and constructing the first phase of the Huangpu River water supply project. The entire city uses seven-digit telephone numbers... They are not stingy with money for the public welfare of the entire city, but the office buildings for the municipal party committee, municipal government, and municipal people's congress have never been on the agenda.

The three offices of the deputy mayors are the offices, reception rooms, and secretaries' rooms used by Comrade Chen Yi when he was the mayor of Shanghai. Premier Zhou Enlai also held a symposium here. If the two revolutionary elders knew about the situation of the "successors," they would surely smile in their graves!

    上海副市长的办公室
    本报记者　尹品端
    有谁会想到，矗立在美丽的外滩“洋楼”群中的上海市人民政府大楼里，七个副市长只有三间办公室。
    记者来到副市长们的办公区，首先映入眼帘的是三个秘书挤在一间不到十五平米的长条房间内，各种各样的文件，几乎把室内空间填得满满的，每个秘书桌上摆放着的三台电话机尤其使人疑惑：要是这9台电话同时鸣响，要是三个秘书同时接电话，那将是怎样一种情形，三个秘书对此似乎早已习以为常，他们说：“各人专心听自己的呗。”
    另一间秘书室，情况基本相同。
    进到里面三间相套的副市长们的办公室，正在伏案工作的谢丽娟副市长，连忙站起来介绍：外面一间是顾传训同志和倪鸿福同志（半个月前调任市委副书记）的；中间是黄菊同志、刘振元同志和她的；里面一间是庄晓天同志和倪天增同志的。
    据说，上一届的七位副市长的办公室也是同样的用房格局。
    纵观这三间房，较之秘书室自然要清爽、雅致一些，这里有壁挂、有小工艺品，文件、书刊也比较整齐地摆放在各人的办公桌和一个小书架上。每位副市长的办公桌上除了与秘书相对应的三台电话机外，还各摆放了一盆鲜花，那红绿相辉映的“一品红”，那争相向外开放、却仍紧紧团结在一起的金菊、紫菊，似乎在向人们暗示桌子主人的志趣与追求。
    不巧的是，这天，七位副市长仅有二位在公办室，不能看到他们同时工作时的“热乎”景况。
    我们在谢丽娟同志的办公室坐定后问道：“三个副市长在一间办公室办公，干扰大不大？”
    “我们合作得很好。”她不假思索地回答。
    这间办公室较另外两间略大一点，所以，中间摆了一个长形会议桌和几把椅子。谢丽娟指着会议桌说：“有时某个副市长所分管部门的同志要在这里开会，另外两个副市长只好到别处去‘打游击’找地方批文件。有时，三个副市长同时接待来联系工作的同志，大家都注意放低声音，轻轻地谈。
    我问从隔壁办公室过来的副市长顾传训同志有何感受，他同样觉得很正常、很自然。他说：“我主管工业，倪鸿福同志主管农业，他下农村一去就是一天，我到工厂一去就是半天，我们俩人互相干扰少。我们也是尽量不让基层同志到市府办公室来谈工作，而是自己多到基层去解决问题。”
    是上海市政府盖不起办公楼吗？不是。
    近十年来，上海市平均每年净上缴中央财政132亿元左右，盖起了近4000多万平方米的居民住宅，先后建起了十几个住宅小区，还新建了火车站、扩建了飞机场、建设了黄浦江一期饮水工程，全市使用了七位数电话……他们为全市人民的公益事业不惜花钱，唯独市委、市府、市人大的办公楼却一直没有排上日程。
    副市长们的这三间办公室，分别是当年陈毅同志担任上海市市长时的办公室、会客室、秘书室。周恩来总理也曾在这里开过座谈会。要是两位革命老前辈知晓“后来人”的此情此状，肯定是会含笑九泉的！
