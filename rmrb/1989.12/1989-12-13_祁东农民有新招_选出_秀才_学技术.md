Farmers in Qidong have a new trick: selecting "scholars" to learn technology. Relatives, friends, and neighbors pool money to send one or a few educated young people to learn technology outside the county. These "scholars," chosen by the group, return home after their studies and pass on their skills to everyone, helping the community to become prosperous together. This new type of learning group has quietly emerged in Qidong County, Hunan Province.

Over the past three years, about 500 learning groups in the county have sent people to study and return to teach, promoting the development of the rural economy.

After the rural economic reforms, the farmers of Qidong County recognized the value of science and technology. They eagerly paid to study planting, breeding, and processing technologies outside the county. However, some households lacking funds and labor found it difficult to study outside. They formed learning groups spontaneously, with the group covering or advancing the tuition fees, and labor within the households being coordinated. This way of pooling money to send people to learn technology allowed farmers to acquire scientific and technological skills without affecting production.

In March of last year, six households in Liuyi Village, Zhangmutang Township, saw an advertisement in the newspaper for a "mushroom cultivation technology training class" in Yueyang City and wanted to attend. However, it was the busy spring planting season, and they couldn't spare the labor. They discussed and decided to send the more educated He Guoping to study, with the rest taking care of his farm work. After He Guoping learned the technology, he immediately taught it to everyone. Now, these six households have all become prosperous.

In 1987, Chengguan Town decided to establish an export carpet factory, requiring 23 people to study in Hebei for seven months, with various expenses for each person amounting to nearly a thousand yuan. The learning group quickly raised the funds. After these young people returned with their skills, they each brought on apprentices. By November of this year, the factory had expanded to 130 people, with an annual output value of 300,000 yuan.

Thus, the "scholars" of Qidong have increased like a rolling snowball.

    祁东农民有新招
    选出“秀才”学技术
    亲友、邻居合伙出钱，选送一个或几个有文化的青年到外地学习技术，这些被大伙推选出来的“秀才”学成归来后，再把技术传授给大家，共同脱贫致富。这种新型的学技术群体在湖南祁东县悄然崛起。
    近3年来，全县约有500个学技术群体派人学成归来传艺，促进了农村经济的发展。
    农村经济改革后，祁东县广大农民认识到了科学技术的价值，他们纷纷自费外出学习种植、养殖、加工等技术。但是，一些缺资金、缺劳力的农户外出学习有困难。他们便在实践中自发地形成了一个个学技术群体，学费由这些群体负担或垫付，家中劳力统一调剂。这种合伙出钱送人学技术的方式，使农民既学到了科学技术，又不影响生产。
    去年3月，樟木塘乡刘丫村何发宏等6户农民在报上看到岳阳市一所学校举办“食用菌栽培技术培训班”的消息，都想前去学习，但正值春耕大忙季节，抽不出劳力。于是，他们商量，推选有文化的何国平前去学习，他家的农活由大伙包起来。何国平学会技术回来，立即传授给大家，现在这6个农户都脱贫致富。
    1987年，城关镇决定办一家出口地毯厂，需派23人到河北学习7个月，每人各种费用需要近千元。学技群体很快将经费筹足。这批青年学成归来后，都带上了徒弟，到今年11月，该厂已发展到130人，年产值达30万元。
    于是，祁东的“秀才”如滚雪球般越来越多了。
