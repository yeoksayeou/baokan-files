The top leaders of Yichun's Party and government have maintained a clear vision and persistently focused on agriculture, leading to continuous prosperity in the region's rural economy.

Yichun is a traditional agricultural area. In recent years, during each winter and spring, the primary leaders of the region and counties (cities) have personally gone to the countryside to promote and implement the Party's policies, stabilizing and improving the household contract responsibility system. Counties and cities such as Shanggao, Gao'an, and Yichun have sent large numbers of cadres to the countryside since the beginning of winter this year to propagate the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session and the Party's relevant rural policies. They have clearly announced that the land under household contracts will remain stable and unchanged. Even in places where the population has increased significantly, the principle of large stability and small adjustments will be maintained, and land will not be redistributed based on population increases. This has effectively dispelled farmers' fears of changes.

Since 1986, the regional and county governments have each year selected over 2,000 cadres and technical personnel from their offices, led by the top leaders of the region and counties (cities), to go directly to the townships, villages, and village groups to work and provide advice for local agricultural production. The direct-affiliated units of the region and counties (cities) have also established corresponding relationships with townships and villages to provide services for agricultural development.

In recent years, the local financial investment in agriculture in Yichun has seen significant growth. This year, despite the tight monetary policy, the regional financial investment in agriculture alone has increased by 600 million yuan compared to last year, a 60% increase. The leaders have set an example, and the people have followed suit. Farmers' investments in improving agricultural infrastructure have also increased significantly compared to the past. This year, over 600,000 laborers in the region have participated in water conservancy projects, and the scale and effectiveness of winter water conservancy construction have been unprecedented in recent years.

The land has not let down those who have worked hard on it. Since 1981, Yichun's grain production has seen stable year-on-year growth, leading all regions in the province. This year, despite significant natural disasters, the total grain production is expected to reach 2.8 billion kilograms, an increase of 100 million kilograms compared to last year.

    宜春党政一把手坚持不懈抓农业
    全区粮食连年稳定增长
    据新华社南昌12月14日电  （通讯员甘学军、记者张香庭）江西省宜春地区地、县（市）党政一把手头脑清醒，多年来坚持不懈地亲自动手抓农业，使全区农村经济连续不断地呈现繁荣景象。
    宜春是个传统农业区。近几年，每年冬春，地、县（市）党政主要领导都直接下到农村宣传落实党的政策，稳定和完善家庭联产承包责任制。上高、高安、宜春等县、市今年入冬以来派出大批干部下到农村，宣传五中全会精神和党的有关农村政策，明确宣布，家庭承包的土地稳定不变，即使个别地方人口增加较多，也应坚持大稳定、小调整，原则上不以人口增加变动土地，更不准将土地打乱重分，有效地消除了农民怕变的思想。
    1986年以来，地、县两级每年轮流从机关抽调2000多名干部和科技人员，由地、县（市）党政一把手带队，直接下到乡、村和村民小组挂职蹲点，为当地农业生产的发展出谋献策。地、县（市）直属单位也都分别同乡、村挂钩联系，为农业发展做好服务工作。
    近几年，宜春地方财政对农业投资有较大增长。今年，在银根紧缩情况下，仅地区一级财政用于农业投入就比去年增加600万元，增长60％。领导带了头，群众有劲头。农民对改善农田基础设施的投入也比过去大大增加，今年，全区60多万劳力上水利工地，冬修水利声势之大，效果之好是近几年来少见的。
    土地不负有心人，从1981年起，宜春地区粮食获得连年稳定增长，增长幅度居全省各地区之首。今年，虽然遭到较大自然灾害，但粮食总产可达28亿公斤，比去年增产1亿公斤。
