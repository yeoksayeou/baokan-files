Ma Steel Captures the "Yellow Dragons"

    A reporter from our newspaper, Zhang Zhen Guo, reports from Ma'anshan on December 21: The sky over Ma'anshan is now free from the two "yellow dragons" that have long plagued the city's ecological environment. On the morning of December 20, the first blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company was adorned with colorful flags. Ma'anshan City Mayor Zhou Yude, with a face full of smiles, announced: The two "yellow dragons" that have troubled the people around Ma'anshan for many years have finally disappeared from the sky.

    These two "yellow dragons" have been harming the people around Ma'anshan for nearly 10 years. Over the past decade, Ma Steel has invested more than 10 million yuan in two types of dust removal equipment: "steam spray dust removal" and "wet electrostatic dust removal." After more than 50 days of network operation, measurements showed that the emissions have reached national standards. Experts from various fields, after on-site observation and appraisal of the emissions meeting the standards, wrote: "The beauty of Jiangnan is enhanced, Ma Steel has captured the two yellow dragons."

    马钢缚住“黄龙”
    本报马鞍山12月21日电  记者张振国报道：安徽马鞍山钢铁公司一钢厂20日上午彩旗飞扬，马鞍山市市长周玉德满面笑容地宣布：困扰全市生态环境的两条烟气“黄龙”，从此在天空消失。
    这两条“黄龙”对马鞍山四周人民已危害多年。近10年来，马钢投入1000多万元，先后上了“蒸喷除尘”、“湿式电除尘”两种除尘设备。并网运行50多天后经测定，烟气排放已达到国家标准。各方专家在现场观察、鉴定烟气排放达标后，有的挥毫祝颂：“江南一枝花更美，马钢缚住两黄龙”。
