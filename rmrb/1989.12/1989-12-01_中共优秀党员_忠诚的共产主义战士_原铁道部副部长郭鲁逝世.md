    An outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal communist fighter, and a significant contributor to the railway industry of New China, former Vice Minister of Railways Guo Lu passed away due to illness on October 20, 1989, in Beijing at the age of 72.

    The funeral for Guo Lu was held this morning at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing. Attendees included Song Renqiong, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Jinfu, Duan Junyi, Fang Yi, Chen Zaidao, Zhu Muzhi, Qiang Xiaochu, Zeng Zi, Ma Guorui, Wang Congwu, Du Yide, Yang Yichen, and Li Senmao. Wreaths were sent by Li Xiannian, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Wang Zhen, Li Tieying, Ding Guangen, Bo Yibo, Huang Zhen, Xi Zhongxun, Chen Muxia, Zou Jiahua, Wang Ruoshui, Gu Mu, Hong Xuezhi, and Ren Zhongyi.

    Guo Lu was born in March 1917 in Wucheng County, Shandong. He joined the revolutionary cause in May 1937 and became a member of the Communist Party of China in December of the same year. During his student days, he eagerly sought progress and actively participated in the December 9th and December 16th student movements, becoming one of the leaders. After the July 7th Incident, he was dispatched by the Party to establish the first anti-Japanese guerrilla unit under the Party's leadership in western Shandong. During the anti-Japanese struggle in southern Hebei, he actively built and developed Party organizations, established the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political Cadres Training Class," and trained a large number of anti-Japanese and rescue cadres. He made important contributions to consolidating and building the anti-Japanese revolutionary base area and developing the Party's cause.

    In early 1948, Guo Lu went to work in the railway department, serving as the director of the Shijiazhuang Hengde Office and the director of the Construction Office. He organized and led the construction and protection of the first people's railway in North China, the De-Shi Line, which played an active role in supporting the transportation of the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. After liberation, Guo Lu served as the director of the Planning Bureau, the director of the Office, and the director of the Factory Management Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. In October 1959, he was appointed as the vice minister and member of the Party Group of the Ministry of Railways. During his tenure overseeing the railway transportation work, he focused on basic construction and management, raising the quality indicators of railway transportation to a new level. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, railway transportation was in a state of semi-paralysis. He relied on the broad cadre and workers of the entire railway system to ensure the normal operation of railway transportation work.

    Guo Lu actively supported the line, principles, and policies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. After retiring in October 1985 with the approval of the Central Committee, he continued to care about the Party's cause and the railway construction industry.

    Guo Lu was a representative of the Fourth National People's Congress. In his more than half-century-long revolutionary career, he was diligent and conscientious in his work. He was upright, honest, frugal, incorruptible, democratic in his style, and approachable, making significant contributions to the railway industry of New China.
