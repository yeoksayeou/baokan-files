The national labor model worker Wang Zhixi passed away more than four years ago, but the breached dam stone, soaked with his and his fellow villagers' sweat and blood, is still there, right? I long to see it again. Is it to pay my respects? Is it nostalgia? I can't say for sure.

I remember it was early August 1963. I was in the mountains of Xingtai County conducting an interview. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a torrential downpour lasted for seven days and seven nights. The rain poured down so heavily that it seemed like waterfalls were cascading from the mountains and springs were gushing from the valleys. The Dongchuankou Reservoir dam couldn't withstand the pressure of the floodwaters and collapsed with a loud roar. The reservoir water, mixed with mountain floods, roared down like a tidal wave, five or six meters high. After the water receded and the rain stopped, half of Nanhuai Village was swallowed up, and over 600 of the 800 mu of land was washed away, causing heavy casualties. What was once a golden, harvest-ready Nanhe Plain suddenly became a desolate landscape of exposed rocks and ruins. The only new addition was a monstrous, oddly shaped object—the breached dam stone. It was about eight or nine meters long, four or five meters wide, and over ten meters high. It stood there like a fierce beast, towering and ominous, a testament to the power of nature. Undoubtedly, it had been carried by the floodwater for six or seven li before coming to a stop.

That afternoon, when I walked through the rubble and water to the base of the breached dam stone, Wang Zhixi was standing there alone. He looked at the stone, made of cement and red, white, and brown rocks, and stamped his feet, pounded his chest, and tears streamed down his face. This was the first time I saw this iron man so agitated, so sad, so tearful! But I understood him.

He was originally from Dongchuankou Village. Every stone on this breached dam stone was familiar to him. He had used such stones to bury his father who died in an old temple; he had led the militia to make landmines from such stones to repel the Japanese invaders' three attacks; he had led the villagers to build terraces and new houses from such stones, turning Dongchuankou into a famous prosperous mountain village known nationwide. Therefore, he was praised by Chairman Mao as a "leader trusted by the people" (see the selected works of "Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," page 21). However, to manage the Qili River and turn the downstream area from suffering to benefiting, the county decided to build the Dongchuankou Reservoir. Dongchuankou Village would become the center of the new lake and had to be relocated. The native land was hard to leave, and the good scenery he had built with his own hands was even harder to part with. But Wang Zhixi still quietly bid farewell to his ancestors' graves and led the relocation. They moved to the then backward Nanhuai Village. He took root in Nanhuai and, after five years of hard work, turned Nanhuai into a rich village, making it a national advanced model again. Just as he was about to take a deep breath of relief, he encountered this unexpected disaster. What was in his heart? Can't you imagine? I tried to comfort him.

Wang Zhixi finally wiped away his tears. Two years after the disaster, he and his fellow villagers, relying on their own hands and shoulders, moved 90,000 cubic meters of earth and created over 400 mu of new land. Immediately after, they dug fish-scale pits all over the mountains and planted various trees. It can truly be said, "Iron shoulders bear heavy burdens, silkworm hands create the world"!

On a day in mid-September this year, I was looking for the breached dam stone in the Nanhe Plain of Nanhuai. It was indeed a search because I couldn't see it as soon as I left the village like I remembered. The entire Nanhe Plain was covered with ridges and dense, tall cornfields. Under the autumn sun around noon, the greens were lush, and the yellows were golden. The agricultural fields, stone dams, and tree walls pushed the Qili River to the foot of the southern mountain. The river flowed gently, singing softly. The locust and pine trees on the southern mountain wove green clouds under the blue sky. The persimmon trees on the northern slope were hung with "red lanterns." The pepper trees released a fragrant scent. Laughter from girls echoed from the apple orchard. Where there used to be a rocky hill, rows of new houses made of green stones and red bricks stood. From the village, the sound of machinery from the village-owned quartz sand factory, marble factory, and foundry roared. Further away, the residential area and chimneys standing on the mountain slope competed with the high mountains. That was the famous Changzheng Automobile Manufacturing Plant known worldwide.

A warm feeling and a sense of joy welled up in my heart. The mountains and rivers were indeed more beautiful and prosperous. The new developments of these few years could indeed comfort the soul of the old model worker.

I wanted to see that breached dam stone even more.

After walking about two li to the southwest in the Nanhe Plain, we "discovered" it in the cornfield. It was no longer as towering and ominous as it was back then. Two-thirds of it were buried in the soil. Now it looked more like a tamed wild cow lying there quietly. I climbed onto the "cow's back," and there were a few vigorous young jujube trees growing on it. Its red, white, and brown layers were covered with a layer of green. I thought that in a few years, people might appreciate it as an "alien visitor" or, as an obstacle to construction, blow it up completely. But when I thought of these things, the scene of the old model worker stamping his feet, pounding his chest, and shedding tears by its side floated back into my mind.

I stood on the "cow's back," looking west along the winding river. In the distance of six or seven li, above the towering mountains, white light and water vapor rose, that was the Dongchuankou Reservoir with a capacity of over 2 million cubic meters. Although it had experienced a dam breach, after reconstruction, it finally benefited the people again. In the drought years, it provided a continuous supply of clear water to Nanhuai and the downstream 200,000 mu of land, nourishing the hearts of the people.

The breached dam stone is like a monument, a monument without words. It records the people's struggles and failures, as well as their struggles after failure. It is a symbol of failure, but also a symbol of victory. People, living in the vast world, are like this, advancing in a winding path. Wang Zhixi and his fellow villagers are indeed ordinary people, not like the wordless monument of Empress Wu Zetian. I want to turn this wordless monument into a monument with words with this small piece.

    脱坝石（散文）
    盖祝国
    全国劳动模范王志琪去世四年多了，但是那浸泡着他和他的乡亲们的血汗的脱坝石还在吧！我渴望再见到它。是凭吊？是眷恋？说不清。
    记得那是1963年的8月初，我正在邢台县山里采访。忽然天色阴沉欲坠，瓢泼大雨一连下了七天七夜。只下得千山撒瀑布，万谷竞飞泉，东川口水库大坝经不住洪水倾注的压力，一声巨响，蹦塌了。库水和着山洪，以五六米高的水头排山倒海般地咆哮而下。水过雨停，南会半个村子被噬去，八百多亩土地被冲走六百多，伤亡惨重。昨天还是金灿灿丰收在望的南河滩，一下子变得乱石裸露，满目凄凉。唯独平添了一个奇形怪状的庞然大物——脱坝石。它长八九米，宽四五米，高十米余。像个猛兽似的兀立在那里，森森然，巍巍然，在向人们显示大自然的威力。无疑，它是被洪水裹携了六七里而停下的。
    那天下午，我踏着乱石残水来到脱坝石下的时候，王志琪正独自在那里。他望着由水泥把红色、白色、褐色石块浇铸在一起的脱坝石，顿足捶胸，热泪横流。这是我第一次见这位铁汉子这样燥，这样悲，这样淌泪！但我理解他。
    他原是东川口村人。这脱坝石上的每一块石头，他都是熟悉的。他曾用这样的石头埋葬了死在破庙里的父亲；他曾带领民兵用这样的石头制成地雷，击退了日本侵略军的三次进犯；他曾领社员用这样的石头砌起梯田，盖起新房，把东川口变成了全国闻名的富裕山村，因此曾被毛主席誉为“为群众所信任的领袖人物”（见《中国农村的社会主义高潮》选本第21页）。然而，为了治理七里河，让下游变受害为受益，县里决定修建东川口水库。东川口村将变为水库新湖的中心，必须搬迁。热土难离，亲手建设起来的好年胜景更是难舍。但王志琪还是悄悄地拜别祖坟，带头搬迁。搬到了当时还很落后的南会村。他又在南会落地生根，经过五年奋斗，南会变富了，又成为全国的先进典型。刚要痛痛快快舒一口气，却又遭受了这意外的大灾大难。他心里是什么滋味，还不能体会吗？我设法上前去劝他。
    王志琪终于擦干了眼泪。灾后两年，他和乡亲们，依靠双手、双肩，运土九万多方，造田四百多亩。紧接着又遍山开凿鱼鳞坑栽上了各种树木，真可谓“铁肩担重担，茧手造乾坤”啊！
    今年9月中旬的一天，在南会南河滩里寻觅脱坝石。确实是寻觅，因为未能像记忆中那样出村就望见它。整个南河滩被条条林洲和高大茂密的玉米林遮盖了。在近午的秋阳照耀下，绿的浓绿，黄的金黄。被农田、石坝和树墙逼到南山根下的七里河，碧波荡漾，淙淙吟唱。南山上的洋槐、松柏，在蓝天下织着绿色的云。北山坡上的柿树枝头挂满了“红色灯笼”。花椒树散发着浓郁的芳香。苹果园里飘出姑娘们的笑声。原来是乱石岗的地方，立起了一排排青石红砖砌成的新房房舍。村那边传来村办的石英砂厂、大理石厂、铸造厂机器的轰鸣声。再远处，是耸立在山坡上的楼房区和试与高山比量的烟囱，那便是闻名中外的长征汽车制造厂了。
    我心里油然升起一阵温暖，几分欢畅。山川毕竟是更美更繁茂了。这几年的新发展，毕竟可以告慰九泉之下的老模范了。
    我越发想尽快见到那块脱坝石。
    在南河滩向西南走二里许，我们在玉米林里“发现”了它。它不像当年那样森森然、巍巍然了。它的2／3已被埋在泥土下。如今倒像是一头刹了威风的野牛乖乖地卧在那里。我爬上了“牛背”，上面竟长出了几株生机勃勃的小枣树。它那红的、白的、褐色的层面上又添了一层绿。我想若干年后，人们或许把它作为“天外来客”来欣赏，或者作为建设的障碍物，把它彻底炸掉。但我想到这些的时候，老模范在它旁边顿足捶胸掉眼泪的情形又浮现在我的眼前。
    我站在“牛背”上，顺着弯曲逶迤而上的河川向西眺望。在六七里之外的巍峨的群山之上，升腾着白光和水气，那便是蓄水200多万立方的东川口水库了。它虽发生过垮坝之祸，但经过重修，终于又为人民造福了。在大旱之年，它为南会、为下游的20多万亩土地提供了源源不断的碧波清流，滋润了人们的心田。
    脱坝石像一块碑、一块无字碑。它记述着人们艰苦奋斗后的失败，也记述着人们失败后的艰苦奋斗。它是失败的象征，也是胜利的象征。人，生存于大千世界间，就是这样迂回前进的。王志琪们毕竟是不见经传的老百姓，不像武则天的无字碑那样。我想以此小文把无字碑变成有字碑吧。
