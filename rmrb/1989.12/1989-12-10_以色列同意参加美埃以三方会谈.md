Our reporter Lin Jiaoming reports from Cairo on December 9: The Israeli cabinet agreed yesterday to send Foreign Minister Arens to participate in the Washington tripartite talks among the United States, Egypt, and Israel, which are being convened by the U.S. government. The talks will prepare for the proposed direct dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis.

This decision was made jointly by Israeli Prime Minister Shamir, Deputy Prime Minister Peres, Foreign Minister Arens, and Defense Minister Rabin. An Israeli working group will soon depart for Washington to participate in the preparatory meetings for the three foreign ministers.

Before the Israeli cabinet decided to participate in the U.S.-Egypt-Israel foreign ministers' meeting, the Egyptian government formally responded to the U.S. government on December 6, accepting Baker's five-point proposal. Egyptian Foreign Minister Maguid announced that Egypt's position is to consult with and obtain recognition from the PLO. Before the three foreign ministers' meeting, Chairman Arafat will visit Egypt to further consult with President Mubarak.
