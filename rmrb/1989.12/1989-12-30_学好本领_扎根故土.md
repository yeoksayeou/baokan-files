At the end of 1978, I was selected to study abroad and spent two years at McMaster University in Canada. Both within and outside the university, Canadian friends were curious and delighted about the arrival of the first batch of Chinese visiting scholars. They were very interested in China's opening up. Leaders and colleagues from my domestic unit also maintained close contact with me and actively helped solve problems at home, eliminating my worries. I felt that studying abroad was not just a personal matter; the hopes of our country, people, and Canadian friends were placed upon us.

Learning advanced science and technology from abroad is important, but making it take root and blossom in our country is even more crucial. For this, suitable soil is necessary. After returning to China, I was able to do some work in the field of isotopic geology, which was made possible by the good soil.

I returned to China in July 1982. Two months later, the leaders of the Institute of Mineral Deposits decided to have me establish new experimental methods. With the support of relevant departments in the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the Ministry of Materials, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources approved the use of $250,000 to import an advanced mass spectrometer for us. In a time when housing was very scarce, the institute leaders personally arranged for us to have rooms, making it convenient for us to establish a new laboratory. The Ministry of Personnel, the National Natural Science Foundation, and the Geological Industry Foundation also provided strong support for our research funds.

In 1985, my colleagues and I successfully built a high-sensitivity, high-precision experimental device and method for analyzing sulfur isotopes using sulfur hexafluoride in China. Compared to the world's first experimental device in Canada, our device improved the design and experimental methods, enhancing reliability, safety, efficiency, and applicability. Later, when I was hired to work in Canada again, based on our design, we renovated the sulfur hexafluoride experimental device in Canada. In 1988, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources awarded our research the second-class prize for scientific and technological achievements. Recently, we have made new progress in the research of isotopic measurement methods. In 1988, we successfully built the first silicon isotope measurement experimental device and method in China. Based on improving foreign methods, we achieved higher precision than authoritative foreign laboratories. In the application of silicon isotope geology, we have also opened up new prospects. In 1989, we established a new method for measuring boron isotopes that surpassed foreign methods and are currently exploring its application range.

My personal experience tells me that the party's policy of opening up to the outside world is correct. Continuing to adhere to this policy will surely achieve even greater results.

    学好本领  扎根故土
    地质科学院矿床所　丁悌平
    一九七八年底，我通过选拔获准出国进修，在加拿大麦克马斯特大学学习了两年。校内和校外的加拿大朋友对新中国首批访问学者的到来十分新奇和高兴，对我国的开放抱着极大的兴趣。国内单位的领导和同事们也与我保持着密切的联系，并主动帮助解决家中的困难，解除我的后顾之忧。我感到出国学习不是我个人的事情，在我们身上寄托着祖国、人民和加拿大友人的希望。
    学习国外的先进科学技术是重要的，但使其在国内生根开花更重要。为此，就必须要有合适的土壤。我回国后能在同位素地质研究方面做一些工作，正是得益于好的土壤。
    我是一九八二年七月回国的。两个多月后，矿床地质研究所领导就决定让我建立新的实验方法。在计委、科委和物资部有关部门的支持下，地质矿产部根据院、所的申请，动用了二十五万美元，为我们进口了一台先进的质谱计。在房屋十分紧缺的条件下，院领导亲自出面为我们调配房间，为建立新的实验室提供方便。人事部、国家自然科学基金会和地质行业基金会在研究经费上也给了我们有力支持。
    我和同事们于一九八五年首次在国内建成了高灵敏度、高精确度的用六氟化硫分析硫同位素的实验装置和方法。与加拿大的世界第一台实验装置相比，我们的装置在设计上和实验方法上均作了改进，提高了可靠性、安全性、效率和适用范围。后来，在我受聘再次到加拿大工作时，根据我们的设计，对加拿大的那台六氟化硫实验装置进行了改建。一九八八年，地质矿产部对我们的这项研究授予科技成果二等奖。近来，我们在同位素测量方法研究中又有新的进展。一九八八年，我们在国内首次建成硅同位素测量实验装置和方法。在改进国外方法的基础上，达到了比国外权威实验室更高的精度。在硅同位素地质应用方面也开辟了新的前景。一九八九年，我们建立了超过国外方法的硼同位素测量新方法，并正在探索其应用范围。
    亲身经历告诉我，党的对外开放政策是正确的。继续坚持这项政策，必将取得更大的成效。
