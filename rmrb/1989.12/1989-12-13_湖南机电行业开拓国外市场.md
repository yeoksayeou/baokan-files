People's Daily, Changsha, December 12th - Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: This year, some enterprises in Hunan's machinery and electrical industry have actively sought to expand into overseas markets in the face of a sluggish domestic market for some of their products, leading to a new turn in production. The export of products such as machine tools, automobiles, and standard parts, which have been sluggish in the domestic market, has expanded from 10 countries and regions last year to 24 countries and regions this year. The variety of exported products has increased to 53 types. The export task for this industry in the fourth quarter of this year is robust, and the export contract amount for next year has already reached 240 million yuan, an increase of 71.4% compared to this year.
