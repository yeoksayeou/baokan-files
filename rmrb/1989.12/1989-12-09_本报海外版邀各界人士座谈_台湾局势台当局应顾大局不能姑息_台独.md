The People's Daily Overseas Edition held a symposium today, inviting prominent figures, experts, and scholars from various sectors in Beijing to discuss the recent activities of "Taiwan independence" forces both inside and outside Taiwan, as well as the outcomes of the recently concluded Taiwan "three-in-one" elections.

Participants in the symposium pointed out that in recent times, as Taiwan's winter and spring elections approached, "Taiwan independence" forces both inside and outside the island have been highly active, with inflammatory rhetoric. Some individuals have formed the "New Country Alliance," even proposing a so-called "Constitution of the Republic of Taiwan." However, the Kuomintang authorities have adopted a lenient and indulgent attitude towards these activities, allowing the "Taiwan independence" rhetoric to become increasingly rampant. This is closely linked to the Kuomintang authorities' long-standing stance of "anti-communism and rejection of peace talks," which has created obstacles to peaceful reunification. Recently, they have also vigorously promoted "flexible diplomacy," effectively creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," attempting to turn Taiwan into an independent political entity. This is a mistaken stance.

The participants believe that only a small minority stubbornly adhere to the "Taiwan independence" position. However, the repeated occurrences of such phenomena have become a hidden danger affecting Taiwan's political situation and social stability, causing strong dissatisfaction among pro-unification forces within the island and widespread concern and attention from patriotic individuals both inside and outside China.

They expressed that any speech or action that splits the nation and deviates from the "one China" principle is unpopular and will undoubtedly face resolute opposition from all patriotic Chinese people, including people from various strata in Taiwan. They hope that the Taiwan authorities will prioritize the overall interests of the nation and the people, act consistently, and avoid doing things that will backfire.

The participants also analyzed the results of the Taiwan "three-in-one" elections and their impact on the island's future political situation.

Attendees included prominent figures, experts, and scholars from various sectors in Beijing, such as Jia Yibin, Song Ximian, Zhao Zili, Guo Pingtan, Li Chunxuan, Wang Qi, Miu Qun, Li Jiaquan, Guo Xiangzhi, and Fang Sheng. The chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Cai Zimin, sent a written speech. The editor-in-chief of the People's Daily, Shao Huaze, also attended the meeting.

    本报海外版邀各界人士座谈
    台湾局势台当局应顾大局不能姑息“台独”
    本报北京12月8日讯  《人民日报》海外版今天邀请在京各界知名人士、专家、学者举行座谈会，讨论近期来台湾岛内外“台独”活动和刚刚结束的台湾“三项公职人员选举”情况。
    与会者在发言中指出，一个时期以来，围绕台湾今冬明春的选举，岛内外“台独”势力活动频繁，言论猖獗，一些人纠集建立“新国家联线”，甚至还抛出所谓“台湾共和国基本法”。而国民党当局对此却采取姑息纵容的态度，致使“台独”声浪愈发甚嚣尘上。这与国民党当局长期坚持“反共拒和”，为和平统一设置障碍，最近又大肆推行“弹性外交”，实际制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”，妄图把台湾搞成独立的政治实体的错误立场是分不开的。
    与会者认为，顽固坚持“台独”立场的只是极少数人，但是一再发生的种种现象，已经成为影响台湾政局和社会安定的一个隐患，引起岛内爱国统一力量的强烈不满和海内外爱国人士的普遍担忧和关注。
    他们表示，任何分裂民族，背离“一个中国”原则的言论和行为，都是不得人心的，势必遭到所有爱国的中国人包括台湾岛内各阶层人民的坚决反对。希望台湾当局以整个国家民族利益的大局为重，言行一致，不要做搬起石头砸自己脚的事。
    与会者还对台湾“三项公职人员选举”的结果及其对岛内今后政局的影响作了分析。
    出席座谈会的有在京各界知名人士、专家学者贾亦斌、宋希濂、赵子立、郭平坦、李椿萱、王奇、缪群、李家泉、郭相枝、方生等。台盟中央主席团主席蔡子民送来书面发言。人民日报总编辑邵华泽也出席了会议。
