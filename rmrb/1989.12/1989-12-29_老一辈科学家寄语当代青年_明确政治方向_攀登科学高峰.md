	Elderly scientists of our country, Yan Jizi, Lu Jiashi, and Wang Ganchang, sent messages to the broad masses of youth today, urging them to clarify their political direction, carry forward the traditions of patriotism and collectivism, work hard, seek knowledge, and strive for excellence. They should make their due contributions to the cause of socialist modernization in our motherland.

	These three elderly scientists participated enthusiastically in the symposium on contemporary youth seeking knowledge and striving for excellence, jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Youth Knowledge Newspaper. Lu Jiashi, in his speech, combined his personal experiences to say that the Party and the government have always cared for and cherished the youth, regarding them as the future and hope of the country. They have always hoped that they would grow up and excel quickly and healthily. Science and technology need to develop, and talent is the key. The broad masses of youth should stand on the basis of reform, competition, and innovation, and not disappoint the earnest expectations of the Party and the government. They should scale the peaks of science.

    这三位老科学家今天兴致勃勃地参加了由团中央和青年知识报联合召开的当代青年求知成才座谈会。卢嘉锡在发言中结合自己的体会说，党和政府历来关心青年、爱护青年，把青年当作国家的未来和希望，一贯期望他们尽快地健康成长、成才。科技要发展，人才是关键。广大青年要立足改革、立足竞争、立足创新，不辜负党和政府的殷切期望，攀登科学的高峰。
