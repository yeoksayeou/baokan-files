The people of Jilin Chemical Industry (Jilin Chemical) are often described by a catchy phrase: "Smart or not, foolish or not, everyone wears a gray uniform." This phrase is both humorous and thought-provoking. What kind of people are these workers who wear gray uniforms?

The Unchanging Masters

Wang Gundiang was diagnosed with a terrible illness—lung cancer. The doctor advised his wife and children, as he would with any patient in his condition, "Don't let him get angry, don't let him overwork, and give him whatever he wants to eat."

His wife's heart ached: he should rest now. He had worked hard all his life, doing heavy labor as a loader, special vehicle repairman, and operating large bulldozers. He never shirked his duties and was always a model worker, an advanced worker, and an outstanding party member. Now, these certificates couldn't stop him from leaving. She wanted him to enjoy a few days of comfort, but he, knowing his condition, worked even harder. The factory had an urgent task—pushing iron powder. He worked for 10 to 12 hours straight for several days. His wife, seeing this, got angry and deliberately didn't pack him a lunch box, thinking he would have to go home without food. But no, he canceled his lunch break and worked continuously.

The closer he got to the end, the more he raced against time. Cancer cells spread throughout his body, but he poured out his love for the factory. On a December night, a rare heavy snow fell, accumulating to a depth of over a foot, making it difficult to walk. People were panting and pushing their bicycles, while buses honked their horns, sliding and getting stuck...

Only the street in front of the dye factory and the roads inside the factory were cleared of snow. Who did this? The workers, cadres, and technicians all looked at the bulldozer in unison. It was him: Wang Gundiang! They saw him jump down from the bulldozer, a smile of satisfaction on his lips. In that instant, everyone's eyes were moist...

Only later did people find out that Wang Gundiang had left his warm home at 2 a.m., braving the north wind, slipping and panting for over two hours to reach the factory. He then drove the bulldozer to clear the snow until it was time for work.

Isn't it said that you get paid for the work you do? Isn't it said that people die for money and birds for food? So, why does a worker near death work so hard? What kind of high price can buy such dedication?

But Wang Gundiang worked this way without any hidden motives, without any sense of heroism. He was driven by his emotions, fulfilling his duty as a master of the factory. In his eyes, a worker should love the factory as his own home. Working for the factory should be as diligent and selfless as working for his own family. Would anyone in a family quibble over working hours and pay? Wouldn't an old person on his deathbed think of leaving something for his family and children?

Now, this old worker has left the world, but in the face of the tide of materialism, he left behind a resounding message: "Rather stand for three days than lie down for three years!"

In Jilin Chemical, there are countless old workers like Wang Gundiang who work without asking for rewards. One old worker worked on the front line for 35 years without ever requesting a transfer, until the day before his retirement...

Some might say, "That's just old workers; they have low education levels. Intellectuals might not be the same." No, you're wrong. Jilin Chemical's elites are no less dedicated in this regard.

Take Guì Chún, a delegate to the 12th National Congress and a national March 8th Red Banner holder. She has no husband, no children, no family. But this doesn't mean she has no aspirations. On the contrary, she began her relentless pursuit of her ideals, whether the sky was clear or stormy. For this pursuit, she did countless "foolish" things.

After graduating from university and studying in the Soviet Union, Guì Chún was originally assigned to work in the capital. But she moved to Dalian for a project and later to Jilin City. The cities got smaller, but her spirit soared. In the 1980s, she became the deputy director and chief engineer of the reagent factory, still wearing a white work uniform and liberation shoes.

Over the decades, she created immense value for Jilin Chemical, though no one has ever calculated it. Just in 1981, she worked for seven days and nights to develop a new process that saved 70,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, creating a value of 910,000 yuan that year.

Over the decades, she never took a single home leave. She spent New Year's Eve on a train, arriving home on the first day of the New Year to see her elderly mother, then went to a sister unit to gather technical information and materials, and returned on the second or third day.

She had no family but treated the factory as her home. She only knew how to work for her "family" but never asked the factory for anything. Once, when the factory distributed soybean oil, she wasn't home, so someone in the workshop made a small bucket for her out of tin. She returned and immediately poured the oil out, returning the bucket.

Although the factory gave her a 16-square-meter room, she insisted on exchanging it for a smaller one. Even so, she never moved in, first lending it to a pregnant worker, then to an engineer without a room. That small room solved many people's problems. She, however, repeatedly declined the leaders' concern, living in a small house opposite the dispatch room for one spring after another...

She had no children but loved children dearly. She gave away all her thermos bottles and cups as a labor model to the nursery, bought hundreds of books for the children, and subscribed to many magazines...

If loving the factory like one's own home and selfless dedication was a beautiful story in the 1950s and a fairy tale in the 1980s, in Jilin Chemical, it was a simple reality.

It's heartening that not only the old masters remain true to their colors, but the new masters have inherited this spirit. A female worker from the "March 8th" insulation team of the Construction Company saw rain coming and rushed to the construction site with her husband. When they arrived, the rain was pouring. They quickly covered the large pile of glass wool with tarpaulins, only then breathing a sigh of relief.

On the way home, despite being soaked like drowned rats, their hearts resonated with a familiar melody:

The long road is dedicated to the distant horizon,
The rose is dedicated to love,
What do I dedicate to you, my Jilin Chemical...

The Traffic Light-Obeying Leaders

Compared to those flashy entrepreneurs, Jilin Chemical Company's manager, Huò Rónghuá, seems to have more "foolish" cells. He doesn't like to boast, speak empty words, or chase after fashionable clothes. Even his office, to this day, has no sofa, electric fan, or carpet.

As the head of China's largest chemical enterprise, Huò Rónghuá has been in his position for five years. These five years saw Jilin Chemical soar into the ranks of the nation's top ten enterprises. Huò Rónghuá, a graduate of the Nanjing Institute of Chemical Technology's Chemical Machinery Department in the 1960s, has grown from an unknown dispatcher to a nationally renowned outstanding entrepreneur.

Yes, enterprises should pursue economic benefits, and entrepreneurs should make big money for their enterprises. This is only natural, but how to pursue and make money is the key.

Some entrepreneurs' secret to success is to exploit loopholes in the country's reforms. They jokingly call this "running a red light." Of course, there are also those who blatantly run red lights.

But Huò Rónghuá, despite having the power and courage, does not dare to step over the line. Take the completion of national plans, for example. Because the state implements a dual-track system, the prices set by the planned economy are generally lower than market prices. Therefore, some enterprises, even if they can complete the national plan, do not do so. Instead, they use false reports of disasters to arbitrarily reduce and lower the national plan indicators, selling planned products at high prices in the market. After making money, they then try to complete the national plan, doing as much as they can.

But Huò Rónghuá says, "The national planned economy is a law. Especially for large enterprises, they should honestly, strictly, and meticulously execute it." He led his team to formulate measures, voluntarily restraining the enterprise's behavior, never turning planned products into non-planned sales.

Numbers may be dull, but they often shine with truth. Look at Jilin Chemical's completion rate of national planned economy indicators in recent years: 101.9% in 1985, 106.5% in 1986, 99.8% in 1987, and 112.8% in 1988. This is rare among large enterprises nationwide.

Know that Jilin Chemical is a major enterprise with an annual sales volume of 4 billion yuan. Each increase in the above Arabic numerals, even in the decimal places, means tens of thousands of "big yuan" from Jilin Chemical's pocket to the state. This isn't "foolishness"?

The distribution issue is one of the most sensitive and thorny problems for enterprises. Why do some enterprises, despite having high bonuses, still curse? Why do some enterprises not work when wages are not increased, and still not work much when wages are increased? That's because there's a problem with the distribution.

In the distribution issue, many enterprise legal representatives run red lights, using various legal means to cover up illegal means, making big money. They don't care about workers' lives, don't care about the destructive operation of equipment, don't care about the enterprise's future, and just make money, then leave a mess and walk away.

But Huò Rónghuá, when formulating Jilin Chemical's distribution plan, both implemented the principle of distribution according to work and prevented the pollution of money worship, achieving five dos and five don'ts:

Do long-term, steady distribution, don't enjoy it all at once;
Do consider neighbors, don't stand out alone;
Do gradually widen the distribution gap, don't break the relationship between cadres and workers;
Do more collective welfare, don't distribute too much money;
Do manage spending, don't just distribute money.

Running through these five dos and five don'ts is a hidden concept: running a socialist enterprise with Chinese characteristics.

Jilin Chemical workers, although their bonuses are not high compared to those enterprises that take everything, are satisfied. Because the highest annual income among workers can be on par with the company manager and party secretary, while the average annual income of managerial-level personnel is only about one times the average income of workers.

Huò Rónghuá himself cut off his own path to wealth!

In Jilin Chemical, Huò Rónghuá and his team, when the enterprise encounters a red light, they do not forget four words: socialism; when they encounter a red light personally, they do not forget four words: Communist Party member.

Huò Rónghuá, when going abroad to negotiate business with foreigners, repeatedly and politely but firmly declined various valuable gifts, showing the moral character of a Communist Party member. A Hong Kong businessman, after Huò Rónghuá refused the gift, said at a banquet, "Mr. Huò not only taught me how to do business but also taught me the way of being a person!"

In the issues of housing, children, and money, leaders are most likely to run red lights. But in Jilin Chemical, the company manager's housing is at most three and a half rooms. Among the more than 300 department-level cadres in the company, many have not yet reached the housing standard.

The former party secretary, Jì Qīngyuǎn, is one of the founders and builders of Jilin Chemical. But during his tenure, none of his children were sent to college, and he did not promote any officials. His eldest daughter was always a worker in a collective-owned enterprise. Those in current company leadership whose children were not sent to college in a roundabout way using public funds include none, but there are some who are working on the production line.

"Socialist entrepreneurs must have a special spirit of dedication!" Huò Rónghuá said this and did this. The reform and opening up provided a stage for entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs took the stage to perform. Some sang the popular song "United to cheat the central government"; some performed a double act of socialism in front and capitalism behind; some showed off their red light-running skills... Huò Rónghuá? Along with most entrepreneurs, he did not miss the opportunity to take the stage, dancing to the good rhythm of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He was full of passion and had just the right amount of fire... But no matter what pattern the red silk shows, the ten big characters "unity, progress, practicality" and "strict, detailed, practical, fast" always shine brightly...

The Positive Cycle of Emotional Channels

The above style of Jilin Chemical people, in wartime, would be praised as Dong Cunrui spirit; in the 1950s, it would be praised as Old Mengtai spirit; in the 1960s, it was praised as Lei Feng spirit. But in the 1980s?

China's 1980s were a time when some people rose, some fell, some awakened, and some turned away... In short, it was a time of great change, great struggle, and great division in Chinese people's values.

Against this backdrop, some people might sneer at, disregard, or mock Jilin Chemical people's "foolishness"... But in Jilin Chemical Company, this "foolishness" is valued. It was in the spring of 1985, when the company launched a big discussion on the deeds of Wang Fengshan: a young communist league member and driver from the wastewater treatment plant, Wang Fengshan, saved three children from icy water. Afterward, he didn't mention it at home or at the factory. The next day, the children's parents came to deliver a thank-you mirror, and that's when it spread.

The wastewater treatment plant wrote a short article of praise, seeking Li Qíshēng, the deputy party secretary, to review it, hoping it could be published in the Jilin Chemical Newspaper.

This was an ordinary matter. It was ordinary because the heroic deed of saving children from icy water started with Luo Shengtao. It was not ordinary because it happened in the 1980s. The reaction to this matter was so different. Some said it should be praised, some said it was "too high," a permanent increase in one-level wages, some said capitalist societies also save children, it's just humanitarianism, and some said Wang Fengshan was foolish, wearing a quilted jacket into the water, what if he couldn't come up, leaving his wife and children...

Li Qíshēng, with his unique political sensitivity, realized this was a good opportunity for ideological education. He liked to write poems, was rich in imagination, and hated mediocre work. He did not sign the article of praise, nor did he unify the tone at a meeting. Instead, with the support of the old secretary Feng Xīruì, he organized a joint investigation team of party, government, trade union, and youth league to investigate Wang Fengshan's school, rural points, and grassroots units for half a month.

The contradictions came out. Wang Fengshan was indeed an idealistic, disciplined, and hardworking good youth, but in five years at the factory, he had never been named an advanced worker. On one hand, he had made mistakes, but mainly it was due to his fashionable clothes and broad interests causing some people's prejudice and resentment. But Wang Fengshan did not mind, still happily working hard, just as he did not publicize saving the children.

Wang Fengshan embodied the characteristics of contemporary young workers. Therefore, how to recognize Wang Fengshan is a big issue for political and ideological workers, including how to recognize the essence of contemporary youth, because youth is the future of Jilin Chemical and an important member of the frontline production force.

Thus, the party committee launched a big discussion on Wang Fengshan's deeds, even involving middle school students. Everyone spoke their minds. Wang Fengshan's image entered every family and every team. Through debate and facts, not only the old generation's ideas were updated, but the young generation's ideas were also corrected. Not only workers' realms were elevated, but cadres' thinking was also opened up. Generation gaps were bridged in new understandings, and the foolish cells of advocating ideals and hard work were recognized and organized in Jilin Chemical. A model led 100,000 people to think, thus opening up a new situation of lively and creative ideological and political work, continuously winning the title of national advanced enterprise in ideological and political work for five years... In 1989, the Jilin Chemical Party Committee was named a model party committee by the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and awarded the title of "Advanced Grassroots Party Organization" by the Organization Department of the Central Committee.

From then on, in Jilin Chemical, loving foolishness, respecting foolishness, and being foolish became the norm.

"Did you know? Li Fu is foolish to the core, adopting a 'father,' bringing an old sick person and a coffin filler to his own home. What do they want? To work? No strength. To have money? The government's relief money isn't enough to hire a nanny!"

"Sigh, it's just a moment of emotional impulse, it's okay for three to five days, but it's hard to sing in the long run!"

This foolish Li Fu is a worker from the Chemical Construction Company. His neighbor, 73-year-old Lián Zēngshān, an old man who never married, now has no relatives or dependents, always frowns and sighs. When he is sick, no one takes care of him. During festivals, he drinks alone, and even the wine becomes bitter. The old man has thought of suicide several times...

Li Fu and his wife, Li Xiùzhēn, discussed and happily brought the old man to their warm kang (heated brick bed). The old man spent 11 springs and autumns in Li Fu's home and passed away in January 1989. Before his death, this 84-year-old old man held Li Fu's hand and said, "It's because of you treating me like your own father that I have the fortune to live to this day..."

Indeed, not to mention the trouble of three meals a day and seasonal warmth, the most unforgettable thing is the four major illnesses the old man had. If it weren't for Li Fu and his wife pushing the old man to the hospital in a car, carrying him up and down the stairs for examinations, and taking care of him by the bedside, buying him delicious things, and bringing him back home for festivals... the old man might have gone to see God long ago.

The old man's last two words before dying were: "It's still good to have the party's leadership, socialism is good, so there are good children like you..."

Yes, the feeling for socialism is not empty, and the feeling for the party is not innate. If a person's small environment makes him develop a hostile mentality, and this hostile mentality cannot be promptly resolved, then he may elevate to dissatisfaction with society. If a party cadre does not wholeheartedly solve the people's difficulties, it will directly damage the people's feelings for the party.

Li Qíshēng has a very clear understanding of this. Dialogue is the "insulating material" for emotional channels, the safety valve for the easy-to-explode points in cadre-mass relations. Every day after work, a day's operation has made him very tired, but there will always be someone coming to talk to him about work or problems. Sometimes one person talks for one or two hours, sometimes five or six people talk for a whole night. Is Li Qíshēng not tired? Of course, he is very tired. Does his wife not feel sorry for him? Of course, she does. As the secretary of 31 second-level party committees and 1,200 party branches, he can completely pass the ball down. But he is never cold to the cadres and workers who come to visit, nor does he make excuses, nor does he let his wife and daughter "block" them at the door.

This may be related to Li Qíshēng's experience. After graduating from Jilin Chemical College, he worked as a technician in a workshop for 8 years, tasted the bitterness of the "only component theory," and experienced the pain of long-term separation. He encountered coldness and discrimination in adversity, but also received warmth and respect, especially the workers' understanding and support, which made him understand the power of emotions and thoughts. Now that he is the party secretary, he always empathizes with the feelings of those below.

One day, a worker in his 50s excitedly came to Li Qíshēng's home: "Qi Sheng, this time I'm going to join the party. But I can't fill out the form, can you help me fill it out?"

"Sure, I'll help you fill it out in two days, you can come to pick it up."

After the worker left, his daughter was surprised: "Dad, isn't this treating you like a secretary? You're already busy with work all day, who can't fill out a party membership application, they have to come to you?"

"Well, this matter you don't understand, this comrade has been applying to join the party for over 20 years, now that he has to fill out the form, he must have thought of many people before choosing me. He can come to me, which means he trusts me and believes I won't refuse him and can fill it out well. We have worked together in the same workshop. If I refuse him, it's like refusing the 200-plus workers of Workshop 3..."

In this regard, his wife is a kindred spirit. She said to Li Qíshēng: "You're tired talking to five or six people every night, but they may only come this once in their lifetime. To find you to talk, they may have struggled at home for several days and wandered around the building for half a day. So if you can do something, you must do it; if you can't, just explain the reason, don't hurt them."

Patiently and sincerely receiving workers' visits, in the eyes of some leaders, seems to be a burden and a burden, but the comrades of the Jilin Chemical Party Committee regard this as a bond to strengthen the connection between cadres and the masses. It is precisely because of this bond that in Jilin Chemical, with more than 100,000 workers, the relationship between cadres and workers and interpersonal relationships are relatively harmonious, like the pipelines in the chemical city that are crisscrossing and can be repaired in time to fix many cracks and fissures.

Cadres understand the feelings of those below, and workers also have enthusiasm for their work. Cadres send warmth to workers, and workers also send warmth to others.

The fertilizer plant has a "March 8th" catering team. When it was first established, the work was average. At that time, the plant party secretary, Zhang Zhen (now the company's deputy manager), gave each of them a nail clipper and said, "Don't underestimate your work. Sometimes what you do can solve problems better than a branch secretary's report. I hope that through your hands, the party's warmth can be sent to the hearts of the workers."

The canteen workers, who felt they were not valued, were deeply moved by the secretary's words and gifts, and each of them burst with great potential. In addition to the normal supply of three meals a day, they also found many "extra" things to do: such as making birthday meals for 300-plus single workers; sending meals to the sick; making festival meals for widows and orphans, washing their bedding; setting up a children's canteen, solving the lunch problem for children of dual-income families...

No wonder the workers jokingly said, "The aroma coming from the canteen window is socialism!"

A worker's wife suffered from schizophrenia. Her twin children went hungry and ran around the streets with their crazy mother. The children's father was on the verge of a mental breakdown... This was known by the aunts of the "March 8th" kindergarten of the Public Utilities Company. They voluntarily took on the task of picking up and dropping off the children in the morning and evening, making clothes for the children, teaching the children to sing, and taking care of the children until they were old enough to go to school. Later, the children's father became an advanced producer. When he received the award, the first thing he thought of was the aunts in the kindergarten who had never received any favors from him...

Why does Jilin Chemical have appeal and cohesion? Why do people who have been transferred still miss Jilin Chemical? Why do old cadres who have retired still want to return to Jilin Chemical? Isn't it precisely this harmonious new type of interpersonal relationship at work? A beautiful moral atmosphere is also a kind of power. In Jilin Chemical, "two civilizations together" is not an empty slogan!

The Proliferation of Foolish Cells

The interview ended, and I couldn't help but think of the catchy phrase "smart or not, foolish or not, everyone wears a gray uniform." Are the people of Jilin Chemical smart or foolish? If you say they are smart, they have done so many foolish things. If you say they are foolish, they have achieved results that make smart people look up to them.

Look at their development: Jilin Chemical is the first large-scale chemical industry base built during China's "First Five-Year Plan," with a fertilizer plant, dye plant, and carbide plant "three major chemicals," and nearly 30,000 workers. Over 30 years, through the hard work of several generations, it has developed into a large-scale chemical enterprise group with 118,000 workers, spanning industries and regions. They produce 640-plus varieties, with 50 varieties exported to more than 30 countries and regions. Their management has miraculously solved the common problem of leakage in the production process of chemical enterprises, achieving civilized production and environmental protection. Their contributions have cumulatively achieved a total output value of 21.6 billion yuan, accumulated more than 10 billion yuan for the state, cultivated and sent out more than 20,000 construction talents, and produced more than 300 scientific research achievements; since 1985, the annual average growth rate of industrial total output value and taxes has been 11% and 15%, respectively. They have won the "May 1st Labor Medal," "Enterprise Reform and Innovation Award," "Sixth Five-Year Plan Science and Technology Progress Comprehensive Award," "Enterprise Management Excellence Award"... just national-level awards alone, they have 13. In 1989, the company was named a second-level enterprise by the state.

It can be seen that the foolishness of the people of Jilin Chemical is indeed a manifestation of great wisdom in foolishness. The people of Jilin Chemical understand hard work, understand pursuit, understand dedicating all their wisdom to building a civilized and happy new life for society, the country, and construction. Such foolishness is indeed respectable and lovable, foolishly wise and noble. Isn't this the same righteousness and spirit of struggle that has been passed down from the ancient legend of Yu the Great controlling the floods and passing his home three times without entering, making our nation prosperous and unyielding? It is heartening that after the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Government, and the Chemical Industry Department successively decided to further learn from Jilin Chemical in Jilin Province and the chemical front, the foolish cells of the people of Jilin Chemical are also proliferating across the country: with more than 8,000 people visiting and learning from Jilin Chemical, and the Jilin Chemical report team traveling tens of thousands of miles, the spirit of Jilin Chemical has spread and been promoted across the 9.6 million square kilometers of land...

专栏：国庆报告文学征文

    吉化人
    李玲修
    聪明人说自己傻，傻子说自己聪明。可来到松花江畔的吉林化学工业公司，有人却用揶揄的口气对我说：“我们吉化人啊，精不精，傻不傻，一人一身灰涤卡。”
    有趣的顺口溜！穿灰涤卡工装的吉化人到底是精还是傻呢？
    不改本色的主人
    王群东患了可怕的难症——肺癌。
    医生像嘱咐所有这类患者亲属一样地嘱咐他老伴和孩子：不要让他生气，不要劳累，想吃点啥就整点啥吧！
    他老伴一阵阵揪心：他是该好好歇歇了。累了一辈子，尽干出力的活，装卸工，特种车修理工，开那么大的推土机……老头子干活儿从不藏奸耍滑，又是劳模啊又是先进啊又是优秀党员的，如今这些奖状也挡不住他要走啊，赶快让他享几天福吧！可他呢，知道了自己的病情反而干得更凶了。厂里有桩急活儿——推铁粉。他出车一干就是十几个小时，一连干了几天。老伴一看急了，故意不给他装饭盒，寻思没饭吃你得回家吧？不，他干脆取消了午休连续干。
    越是接近死亡线，他越是争分夺秒地干。癌细胞在他的体内扩散，他却把爱厂之情向体外挥发……12月的一个夜晚，飘飘洒洒地下了一场罕见大雪，积雪足有一尺半厚，踏上去几乎没了膝盖。
    大雪给交通造成极大困难，步行累得呼哧呼哧直喘，骑车的只能推着车走，班车按着喇叭一路开道，时而打滑，时而堵塞……
    唯有染料厂门前的大街露出了沥青的路面，还有厂区内的大道也打扫得干干净净……
    这是谁干的好事？上班的人们不约而同向那辆推土机望去，是他：是王师傅！只见王群东从上面跳下来，嘴角挂着一丝欣慰的笑意。这一瞬间，工人、干部和技术员的眼睛都湿润了……
    事后人们才知道，王群东凌晨两点就从热乎乎的家里冲了出来，迎着北风，一步一滑、一步一喘地走了两个多小时才到厂里，又开推土机推雪，一直干到上班时间。
    不是说给一份钱干一份活儿么？不是说人为财死鸟为食亡吗？那么，一个临近死亡的工人这样拚命干，究竟是为了什么？出什么样的高价才能买到这样的积极性呢？
    可是王群东这样干，完全没有任何索取的潜在意识，也没有一丝英雄主义的自我感觉，只是受感情的驱使，尽他主人的天职。在他看来，工人就应爱厂如家。给厂干活儿就应该像给自己家干那样任劳任怨。难道在家里，会有哪个户主或主妇要斤斤计较工作时间和报酬么？难道在家里，一个老人临死前想到的不是给亲人和孩子多留下点什么吗？
    如今这位老工人已经离开了人世，但是面对拜金主义的洪水，他留下了掷地有声的遗言：“宁肯站着干三天，也不躺着活三年！”
    在吉化，像王群东这样不计报酬的老工人不计其数，有个老工人一线倒班35年，从未要求调动，直至退休前一天还在上夜班……
    也许有人会说，那是老工人嘛，文化水平低，要是知识分子就未必如此了。不，你错了，吉化的精英们在这方面也并不比工人差。
    就说十二大代表，全国三八红旗手桂纯吧。她没有丈夫，没有孩子，没有家庭。
    但这并不意味着她没有了追求。相反，她开始了对理想炼塔的全力攀登，不管万里无云还是风雨交加，她都没有停步，为了这攀登，她干了数不清的傻事情。
    大学毕业后又留学苏联的桂纯本来分配在首都工作，可她为了搞一个项目迁到了大连。后来又迁到了江城吉林市。
    城市越迁越小，精神却越来越昂扬。进入80年代，她成为试剂厂副厂长兼总工程师，仍是一身发白的工作服，一双解放鞋。
    几十年来，她为吉化创造了多少价值，没有人去统计。仅是1981年她苦战了七天七夜获得成功的一项新工艺，就每天可节电七万度，当年创造产值91万元。
    几十年来，她没有休过一个探亲假。腊月三十也曾在火车上度过，初一到了家，看看年迈的老母亲，还要到兄弟单位去了解科技信息和资料，初二、三又登上归程。
    她没有家，却把工厂当成家。她只知道为“家里”干活，却不知道向厂里要什么。有一次厂里分豆油，她不在家，有人在车间用白铁皮为她做了个小桶，她回来后立即把油倒出来，把桶退了回去。
    尽管厂里分给她一间16平方米的住房，但她却要求换成小间的。即使这样，她也一直没搬进去，先是借给要生孩子的女工，后又借给没房的工程师，那间小屋不知解了多少人的难处。而她呢，却一再谢绝领导同志的关心，住在调度室对面的小屋里度过了一个又一个春秋……
    她没有孩子，但却十分爱孩子。她把自己当劳模得的暖瓶、茶杯全都给了托儿所，还掏钱给孩子们买了几百本书，订了许多杂志……
    如果说，爱厂如家无私奉献在50年代是佳话，80年代是童话，那在吉化，却是朴朴素素的现实。
    可喜的是，不仅老主人不改本色，新主人也受了遗传。建设公司“三八”保温班的一名普通女工，在家里看见天要下雨，拉起丈夫就往工地上跑。等到两人赶到工地时，大雨下得正起劲，她和丈夫忙扯篷布把大堆玻璃棉毡盖好，这才松了一口气。
    回家的路上，尽管两人被淋得像落汤鸡，心头却愉快地回响起他们熟悉的旋律：
    长路奉献给远方，
    玫瑰奉献给爱情，
    我拿什么奉献给你啊，
    我的吉化……
    不闯红灯的掌权人
    比起那些聪明外露的企业家来，吉化公司经理霍荣华的傻细胞似乎多了些。他不喜欢夸夸其谈，说空话、套话，也不追逐服饰的时髦与气派，甚至他的办公室里到目前为止还没有沙发、电扇和地毯。
    作为中国第一大化工企业的掌权人，霍荣华登上经理宝座已达五年之久。这五年是吉化腾飞跃入全国十大企业的五年。而霍荣华，这个六十年代毕业于南京化工学院化工机械系的大学生，也由一个名不见经传的调度长成长为全国著名的优秀企业家。
    是的，企业要追求经济效益，企业家要给企业赚大钱，这是天经地义的事情，但是怎么追求怎么赚，可就有学问了。
    君不见有些企业家发达的诀窍不就是钻国家改革的空子吗？他们戏称这是绕红灯。当然，不择手段闯红灯者也不乏其人。
    可霍荣华，虽有权也有胆却在这方面不愿越“雷池”一步。
    就说对待国家计划的完成吧，因为国家实行双轨制，指令性计划的划价大都低于市场价格，所以有的企业明明能完成国家计划也不去完成，而是用谎报灾情的手段擅自削减压低国家计划指标，把计划内产品拿去投放市场卖高价，把钱捞到手后，再去应付国家计划，能完成多少算多少。
    可霍荣华说：“国家指令性计划就是法令。特别是大企业，要老老实实地执行，不折不扣地执行，千方百计地执行。”他带领一班人制定出措施，自觉地约束企业行为，从不把计划内产品变为计划外销售。
    数字也许是枯燥的，但往往闪着真实的光泽。请看吉化近几年国家指令性计划的完成率：1985年为101.9％，1986年为106.5％，1987年为99．8％，1988年为112.8％。这在全国的大企业中屈指可数。
    要知道，吉化是年销售额40亿的大户，上述每一个阿拉伯数字的增加，哪怕是小数点后面的每一个阿拉伯数字的增加都意味着成千上万的“大团结”从吉化的腰包掏给了国家，这不是“傻”是什么？
    分配问题是企业最敏感最棘手的问题之一。为什么有的企业奖金并不低，但职工拿了奖金还骂娘？为什么有的企业不长工资不干活儿，长了工资也干不了多少活儿？那是因为分配问题上出了毛病。
    在分配问题上，不少企业的法人代表闯红灯，利用各种合法手段掩盖不合法手段，大把大把捞钞票。不管工人死活，不管设备破坏性运转，不管企业后劲儿，拚命地捞，然后扔下一个烂摊子，拂袖而去。
    可是霍荣华在主持制定吉化的分配方案时，既贯彻按劳分配的原则，又防止拜金主义的污染，做到了五要五不要：
    要细水长流，不要当年乐；
    要照顾左邻右舍，不要单出头；
    要逐步拉开分配差距，不要拉断干群关系；
    要多搞集体福利，不要过多分钱；
    要管好花钱，不要只管发钱。
    贯串在这五要五不要字里行间的有一个潜在概念，那就是办一个有中国特色的社会主义企业。
    吉化职工虽然分得的奖金和那些吃光分净的厂子比，不算高，但他们心悦诚服。因为工人中最高的年收入可以和公司经理、党委书记不相上下，而经理级人员的年平均收入不过是职工平均收入的一倍。
    霍荣华自己断了自己的财路！
    在吉化，霍荣华和他的一班掌权人在企业遇到红灯时，他们不忘四个字：社会主义；在个人遇到红灯时，他们也不忘四个字：共产党员。
    霍荣华在出国与外商谈判生意时，多次单独婉言而坚决地谢绝各种贵重礼品，显示了共产党员的情操。一位港商在霍荣华拒收礼品后，在宴会上敬酒说：“霍先生不仅教我做生意，还教我做人之道！”
    在房子、孩子、票子问题上，掌权人最易闯红灯。可在吉化，公司经理级的住房顶多三间半。全公司300多名处以上干部中，许多人尚未达到住房标准。
    前党委书记纪清远，是吉化创业和建设者之一。可他掌权期间，子女无一保送上大学的，也没有提拔干部的，大女儿一直是集体所有制工人。变相用公费保送进大学的，现任公司领导的子女没有一个，倒有一些是在生产一线倒班的工人。
      “社会主义的企业家必须有特殊的献身精神！”霍荣华是这样说，也是这样做的。改革开放为企业家提供了一个大舞台，企业家纷纷登台表演，有人唱“联合起来骗中央”的流行曲；有人演社会主义在前，资本主义在后的双簧；有人耍闯红灯的车技……霍荣华呢？和大多数企业家一道，不失时机地登上舞台，踏着社会主义好的旋律跳着有中国特色的红绸舞，他激情充沛而又极有火候，他左右腾跃而又不乱节奏……然而不管红绸翻出什么惊人的图案，那上面“团结、进取、实干”和“严、细、实、快”十个大字总是闪闪发光……
    感情管道的良性循环
    吉化人的上述风格，在战争年代是会被誉为董存瑞精神的，在50年代会被誉为老孟泰精神，60年代曾被誉为雷锋精神，但在80年代呢？
    中国的80年代啊，是一些人崛起的年代，也是一些人沉沦的年代，是一些人觉醒的年代，也是一些人转向的年代……总之，是中国人的价值观大转换、大搏斗、大分化的年代。
    在这个大背景下，有人会对吉化人的那种“傻”劲嗤之以鼻，或不屑一顾，或冷讽热嘲……反正在许多人眼里，吉化人的那种傻劲早已贬值了。
    不过，在吉化公司，这种傻劲却是升值的。那是1985年春寒料峭的时节，公司展开了一场王凤山事迹的大讨论：污水处理厂共青团员、汽车司机王凤山从冰水里救出三名儿童。事后他回到家里没说，到了厂里也没提。第二天孩子家长来送感谢镜，这才传开来。
    污水处理厂写了篇豆腐块大的表扬稿，来找党委副书记李奇生审阅，希望能在《吉化报》上登一下。
    这本来是件极普通的事情。说它普通，是因为冰水救儿童的英雄行为从罗盛教就开始了。说它不普通，是因为它发生在80年代。对这件事反应是那样不同。有人说该表扬，有人说是“点高”，一级工资长定了，有人说资本主义社会也救儿童，不过是人道主义，也有人说王凤山傻，穿棉衣下水，一下子上不来，扔下老婆孩子怎么办？
      李奇生以他特有的政治敏感意识到这是一个进行思想教育的好契机。他喜欢写诗，富有想象力。也讨厌工作平庸一般化。他没有签发表扬稿，也没有在大会上统一口径，而是在老书记冯锡瑞的支持下，组织了个党政工青联合调查组到王凤山呆过的学校、下乡点和基层单位进行了半月的调查。
    矛盾点出来了。王凤山的确是个有理想、守纪律、干实事的好青年，但入厂五年没评过先进。一方面是他有过过失，但主要是由于他的穿着入时、兴趣广泛引起一些人的成见和反感。可王凤山对此并不在意，仍然乐呵呵地傻干，如同他救了儿童也并不声张一样。
    王凤山身上集中了当代青年工人的特点。因此如何认识王凤山，是包括政治思想工作者在内如何认识当代青年本质的大问题，因为青年是吉化的未来，是组成第一线生产主力军的重要成员。
    于是党委发动了一场王凤山事迹大讨论，连中学生也都参加了。七嘴八舌，各抒己见。王凤山的形象进入了每个家庭和每个班组。经过辩论和摆事实，不仅中老年的观念得到更新，青少年的观念也得到矫正。不仅工人的境界得到升华，干部的思路也为之洞开。代沟在新认识中弥合，讲理想讲实干的傻细胞在吉化得到认同和组织培养。一个典型引起十万人思索，从而打开了生机勃勃富有独创性的思想政治工作新局面，连续五年赢得了全国思想政治工作优秀企业的称号……1989年吉化党委被吉林省委命名为模范党委，被中组部授予“先进基层党组织”称号。
    从此在吉化，爱傻，敬傻，当傻，蔚然成风。
    “知道吗？李福傻透腔了，拣个‘爹’，把个老病包子、棺材瓤子弄到自己家去了。你说他们俩口子图个啥？图他干活？没力气。图他有钱？政府那几个救济金还不够雇保姆呢！”
    “唉，不过是一时感情冲动，三五日还行，日子长了就有难唱曲了！”
    这个傻李福是化建公司的一名工人，他的邻居，73岁的廉增山老人一辈子没成家，如今无亲无故，无依无靠，整天愁眉苦脸、唉声叹气。生病时无人照顾，过节时自斟自饮，酒也成了苦水，老人还几次动过轻生的念头……
    李福和妻子李秀珍一商量，把老人高高兴兴地接到了自己家的热炕头上。
    老人在李福家度过了11个春秋，1989年1月才病故。临终前这位84岁的老人拉着李福的手说：“亏你们像对待自己的老爹一样待我，我才有福活到今天啊……”
    的确，不说一日三餐四季冷暖添不少麻烦，最难忘的是老人得过的四场大病，若不是李福两口子用车推着上医院，楼上楼下背着老人检查，病榻前精心护理，不仅给老人买可口的东西，还接老人回家过节团聚……老人恐怕早就去见上帝了。
    老人咽气前说的最后两句话是：“还是党的领导好，社会主义好，才有你们这样的好孩子……”
    是的，对社会主义的感情不是架空的，对党的感情也不是生而有之的。如果一个人的小环境使他产生仇视心理，而这种仇视心理不能及时得到疏通，那么他可能升级到对社会不满。如果一个党员干部不满腔热情为群众排忧解难，那就会直接损伤了群众对党的感情。
    对这一点，李奇生有非常清醒的认识，对话是感情管道的“保温材料”，是干群关系易燃易爆点的安全阀。他每天下班回来，一天的运转已使他很疲劳，但是总会有人来找他谈工作谈问题。有人一谈一两个小时，有时一晚上谈五六个人。李奇生不累吗？当然很累。他妻子不心疼吗？当然心疼。作为手下有31个二级党委，1200个党支部的书记，他完全可以把球往下踢。但他对来访的干部工人，从不冷漠，也不敷衍，更不让妻子女儿在门口“挡驾”。
    这也许和李奇生的经历有关。他从吉林化工学院毕业后在车间当了8年技术员，尝过唯成份论的苦果，体会过长期两地分居的滋味。他在逆境时遇到过冷漠与歧视，也得到过温暖与尊重，特别是工人的理解与支持使他懂得感情和思想的力量。如今他当了党委书记，总是设身处地的体谅下情。
    一天一位50多岁老工人兴冲冲来到李奇生家：“奇生啊，这回我也要入党了。不过这表我填不好，你帮我填填吧！”
    “行，我两天之内帮你填好，你来取吧。”
      老工人走后，女儿惊诧了：“爸，这不是把你当秘书了吗？你一天工作够忙的了，入党志愿书谁还不能填，非来找你？”
      “哎，这个事你可不明白，这位老师傅要求入党20多年，现在要填表了，他脑子里不知过了多少人，才选择了我。他能来找我，说明他信任我，认为我不会拒绝他，而且能填好。我们一个车间共过事。我如果拒绝他，就是拒绝了三车间200多工人
  ……”
    在这一点上，妻子可算知音，她对李奇生说：“你一天晚上接待五六个人是累，可人家也许一辈子就来这一回。为找你谈话，可能在家里斗争了好几天，来了后又在楼前楼后转半天。所以能办的事儿你一定要给办；不能办的，就说清道理，千万别伤人家。”
    耐心而真诚地接待职工来访，在某些领导看来，似乎是一种累赘与负担，但吉化党委的同志把这视为加强干部同群众联结的纽带。正是有了这种纽带，在有10多万职工的吉化，干群关系人际关系才比较和谐，就像化工城里纵横密布的管道一样，上下左右能够畅通，及时修补了许多缝隙和裂纹。
    干部体谅下情，群众工作起来也就有了热情。干部为工人送温暖，工人也就为他人送温暖。
    化肥厂有个三八炊事班，刚成立时工作平平。当时的厂党委书记张真（现为公司副经理）发给她们每人一把指甲刀，对她们说：“你们不要小看了自己的工作。你们做好一件事，有时比支部书记做场报告都解决问题。希望通过你们的手把党的温暖送到职工心坎上。”
    认为自己不受重视的炊事员们，深为书记的话语和礼物所感动，个个迸发出巨大潜能，除了正常的供应一日三餐外，还找了不少“额外”的事情干：如为300多名独身职工做生日饭；为独身者送病号饭；给孤寡老人作节日餐，给他们拆洗被褥；办起了儿童餐厅，解决双职工子女中午就餐的困难……
    难怪群众幽默地说：“卖饭的窗口飘出来的香味就是社会主义好……”
    一个工人的妻子得了精神分裂症。她的双胞胎孩子吃不上饭，整天跟着疯妈妈满街跑。孩子的爸爸精神上几乎濒临崩溃……这事被公用事业公司三八幼儿园的阿姨知道了，她们早晚便主动承担接送孩子的劳务，还为孩子做衣服，教孩子唱歌，一直把孩子带到上学的年龄。后来孩子的爸爸成了先进生产者。他得到奖状时，首先想到的便是幼儿园里那些从未得到他任何好处的阿姨……
    为什么吉化有吸引力，有凝聚力？为什么有人调走了还想吉化？为什么老干部退休了小楼不住还要回吉化？难道不正是这种新型的人际关系的和谐在起作用么？美好的道德氛围也是一种力量。在吉化，“两个文明一起抓”可不是一句空话！
    傻细胞的增殖
    采访结束了，不禁又想起了“精不精，傻不傻，一人一身灰涤卡”的顺口溜。吉化人到底是精还是傻呢？说他们精，他们办了那么多傻事。说他们傻，他们却取得了使聪明人望尘莫及的成果。
    请看他们的发展：吉化是我国“一五”期间重点建设的第一个大型化学工业基地，当时有化肥厂、染料厂、电石厂“三大化”，职工近3万人。30年来，经过几代人的艰苦奋斗，已发展成有11.8万职工的跨行业、跨地区的大型化工企业集团。他们生产的640多个品种，有50种远销30多个国家和地区。他们的管理，奇迹般地解决了化工企业生产流程中习以为常的跑冒滴漏现象，实现了文明生产和环境保护。他们的贡献，累计实现总产值216亿元，为国家积累资金过百亿元，培养输送了两万多名建设人才，出了300多项科研成果；1985年以来，工业总产值和利税年平均递增率分别为11％和15％。他们获得过“五一劳动奖状”、“企业改革创新奖”、“六五科技进步全优奖”、“企业管理优秀奖”……仅国家级大奖就有13项。1989年公司被国家命名为二级企业。
    可见，吉化人的傻，实在是一种大智若愚的表现。吉化人懂得实干，懂得追求，懂得为社会为国家为建设一种文明幸福的新生活奉献自己的全部才智。这样的傻实在傻得可敬可爱，傻得聪明崇高。这不正是我们中华民族从大禹治水三过家门而不入的古老传说里，延续至今并不断发扬光大，使我们的民族繁衍不衰万劫不倒的那种浩然正气与奋斗精神吗？令人欣慰的是，在吉林省委、省政府和化工部相继作出进一步在吉林省和化工战线学吉化的决定后，吉化人的傻细胞也在不断向全国增殖：随着8000多名来吉化参观学习的人归去，随着吉化事迹报告团行程几万里的巡回，吉化精神已在960万平方公里的土地上扩散、传扬……
