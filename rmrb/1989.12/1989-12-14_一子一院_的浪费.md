Title: The Waste of "One Son, One Courtyard"

In our local countryside, the outdated practice of "one son, one courtyard" is still prevalent. Every male member of a household, even if they are minors, is allocated a plot of residential land in anticipation of future marriage and independent living. In my village, a family with the surname Xu has five brothers, each with their own courtyard; a farmer with the surname Peng has a ten-year-old son and a five-year-old son, and he has already marked out two plots of residential land on his farmland.

In the 1980s, over 200 men in my village left their original residential plots to build new houses after getting married, wasting over 100 acres of fertile, high-yielding farmland. Just one village has wasted so much good land due to the practice of "one son, one courtyard." What a shame.

    “一子一院”的浪费
    湖北省仙桃市　王一益
    我们这一带乡村至今还沿袭着“一子一院”的陈规陋习。凡家庭中的男性成员，即使是未成年的孩子，每人都要划定一处宅基，以备将来成家后独住一院。我村一家姓许的有五弟兄，就有五个独院；有一家姓彭的农民，大儿子只有十岁，小儿子只有五岁，他也在耕地上划了两处宅基。
    八十年代，我村有二百多男性成家后离开老宅基，重新建房，浪费肥沃的高产田上百亩。一个村就因“一子一院”浪费这么多良田，多么可惜。
