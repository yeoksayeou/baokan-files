One day, Dong Xinmin, the director of the Jishan Coal Washing Plant in Shanxi Province, returned from Yuncheng to Jishan. As the car passed through his hometown, an elderly man wearing a large straw hat, carrying a pole with two buckets of water, was crossing the road. He nearly got hit by the speeding car. The driver quickly stopped the car, and Dong Xinmin got out to see that the old man was his own father. He took over the pole and carried the water back home, staying with his father for 10 minutes. After getting back in the car, the driver said, "Director, you should take care of this home more." Dong Xinmin sternly replied, "Speed up!" The car sped off, but tears welled up in his eyes.

Ever since 1985, when he was tasked with establishing the coal washing plant, Dong Xinmin has had to travel to Yuncheng countless times each month, passing through his hometown every time. Yet, he rarely had the chance to go home even once every half year. This time was an exception.

In the three years since the plant was built, Dong Xinmin has not spent a single Spring Festival at home. Out of 365 days in a year, he has not taken a single day off for holidays. An office staff member said, "We don't keep track of overtime for officials, but if we did, Director Dong would be working two shifts a day and still be at a loss!"

His elderly father complained, "The boy has even forgotten what I look like!" His wife lamented, "The children have been in school for years, but he has never looked at their homework notebooks..."

Dong Xinmin certainly missed his father, wife, and children, but he considered the construction of the coal washing plant to be of utmost importance.

Jishan County is located in the Yuncheng region and is a poor county, receiving over 100 million yuan in fiscal subsidies from the state each year. Building a coal washing plant with an annual output of 600,000 tons of washed coal could utilize the resources of neighboring Xining County and benefit the people of Jishan. Dong Xinmin originally worked at the Jixiu Coal Washing Plant and later served as the deputy manager of the Jishan Industrial Supply and Marketing Company. He proposed the idea of building a coal washing plant to the Jishan County Committee. The province approved the project, and the responsibility of establishing the coal washing plant fell on his shoulders.

Everything started from scratch. Securing funds, designing, procuring materials—there were countless tasks that Dong Xinmin had to handle personally. He devoted himself entirely to the construction of the plant.

The project required an investment of over 20 million yuan, but Dong Xinmin was meticulous in every detail, ensuring not a single penny was wasted.

When traveling to Taiyuan on business, he always stayed in rooms shared by three or five people and never ate at expensive restaurants. His car was stocked with instant noodles, and he often ate on the road. Sometimes, when he drove to various departments in Taiyuan to handle business, he would park the car in a nearby alley to avoid the parking fee of one yuan, walking to his destination instead. In his office-cum-bedroom, the most luxurious items were two electroplated chairs. When the plant planned to add a few sofas, he firmly refused. Colleagues who often traveled with him said, "The construction investment is so large, and even when traveling on business, you should be a bit more comfortable. It wouldn't cost much!" But Dong Xinmin said, "The project money is substantial, but it all belongs to the state. Every penny must be used for the construction of the project. I have no right to waste a single cent."

Under Dong Xinmin's leadership, the workers endured hardships to build the modern Jishan Coal Washing Plant, which now stands proudly. It began trial operations just before National Day.

    创业者
    ——记稷山洗煤厂厂长董新民
    秦泓
    一天，山西稷山洗煤厂厂长董新民从运城返回稷山，汽车经过他的家乡。一位老人头戴大草帽，挑着一担水，一步三颤地过马路，差点被急驶的汽车撞着。司机赶忙停车，董新民下车一看，这老人竟是自己的父亲。他接过担子把水挑回家，陪老人在家里呆了10分钟。上车后，司机说：“厂长，这个家你还是该顾着点”。董新民硬梆梆地甩过两个字：“加速！”汽车飞奔起来，他的眼里却涌出了泪花。
    自从1985年授命筹建洗煤厂，董新民每个月不知要跑运城多少次，每次都路过他的家乡，可他半年也难得进一次家门。这次已是破例了。
    建厂3年，董新民3年没有在家过春节。一年365天，董新民没有休息过一个节假日。厂办公室一位考勤员说：“干部不记加班，如果记加班，董厂长每天工作时间记两个工还吃亏哩！”
    老父亲抱怨：娃连俺的模样都忘了！妻子埋怨：孩子上学几年了，他从来没看过孩子的作业本……
    董新民何尝不惦记着父亲、妻子、孩子，只是他把建设洗煤厂看得重于一切。
    稷山县位于运城地区，是个穷县，每年吃国家财政补贴100多万元。建设一座年产60万吨洗精煤的洗煤厂，可利用毗邻的乡宁县的资源，造福稷山百姓。董新民原在介休洗煤厂工作，后任稷山工业供销公司副经理。他向稷山县委提出了建设洗煤厂的建议。省里立了项，筹建洗煤厂的重任也落到了他的身上。
    一切从零开始。筹资金，搞设计，跑材料，多少事需要董新民去奔波，董新民一心扑在了建厂上。
    工程投资2000多万元，董新民却处处精打细算，不乱花一分钱。
    到太原出差，他每次都住三五个人的大房间，吃饭从不去大饭店。他的汽车上有方便面，经常在车上就把饭吃了。有时带车去太原一些部门办事，门口不能停车，放停车场要花一块钱，他就让司机把车开到附近小巷里，他步行去办事。他的办公室兼寝室里，最漂亮的就数两把电镀椅子了。厂里要给添几个沙发，他坚决不肯。常和他出差的同志说，建厂投资这么多，出差也应讲究点，这能花几个钱！可董新民却说：工程钱是不少，可都是国家的，一分一厘都要用在工程建设上，我没有权力乱花一分钱。
    董新民带领职工艰苦创业，现代化的稷山洗煤厂已巍然屹立，国庆前夕投入了试生产。
