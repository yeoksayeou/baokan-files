The Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee and Government promptly analyzed the market situation and, with a focus on the actual interests of the people, increased effective supply and implemented a combination of management and assistance. This has led to a monthly decline in the retail price index from January to the end of October, from a high of 26.9 percentage points at the beginning of the year to 8.3 percentage points at the end of October, a decrease of 24.6% compared to the same period last year. This places Xuzhou among the lowest in Jiangsu's 11 prefecture-level cities.

The Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee and Government have prioritized increasing effective supply as a fundamental measure to stabilize prices. The city has required departments closely related to people's lives, such as commerce, grain, supply and marketing, fisheries, and salt, to ensure ample supply of both scarce and bulk commodities, guaranteeing quality and strictly implementing price policies. The Municipal Vegetable Office, while managing the first-line (suburban) vegetable bases, has also expanded the planting area of the second and third-line vegetable bases, ensuring a variety of vegetables, sufficient quantities, and low prices. This year, the retail price index for vegetables has dropped to 8 percentage points, making it the lowest-priced commodity in the city. The abundant "vegetable basket" has been well-received by the people.

Focusing on the overall goal of price control, the Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee and Government have ensured that each level is responsible for implementing and monitoring the goal. Deputy Mayor Wang Wulong frequently coordinates and understands the city's overall price control situation, identifies problems, and communicates with relevant departments such as the price bureau in a timely manner. Based on this, the city has broken down the province's 42-item price control target into 36 departments and 14 specialized companies, down to the shop and team levels.

The combination of management and assistance has enabled the Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee and Government to effectively control prices.

    增加有效供应　实行管帮结合
    徐州稳定物价见成效
    本报讯　徐州市委、市政府及时分析市场形势，从关心群众实际利益出发，增加有效供给，实行管帮结合，使今年1至10月底的零售物价指数逐月下降，由年初最高的26.9个百分点降到10月底的8.3，比去年同期回落24.6％，在江苏11个省辖市中居最低水平。
    徐州市委、市政府把增加有效供给当作稳定物价的基本措施来抓。市里要求与人民生活密切相关的商业、粮食、供销、水产、食盐等部门，不管是紧俏商品或者大宗商品，都要货源充足，保证供给，供应中做到质量好，严格执行物价政策。市蔬菜办公室在管好一线（郊区）蔬菜基地的同时，又扩大二、三线蔬菜基地的种植面积，使上市的蔬菜品种多、数量足、价格低。今年以来，蔬菜零售物价指数下降到8个百分点，成为全市所有商品中价格最低的商品。丰实的“菜篮子”使人民群众对此津津乐道。
    眼睛盯住物价控制总目标，做到层层分解层层抓，是徐州市委、市政府抓好稳定物价的又一个特色。代市长王武龙经常调度了解全市物价总目标的控制情况，发现问题，及时和物价等有关部门通气打招呼。在此基础上，全市把省下达的物价控制总目标的42个项目分解到36个部门的14个专业公司，直至门点班组。
    管中有帮，帮中有管，管帮结合，使徐州市委、市政府抓稳定物价抓出了成效。　（任愚颖）
