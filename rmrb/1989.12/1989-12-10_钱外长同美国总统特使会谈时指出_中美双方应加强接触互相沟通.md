Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 9th. Reporter Hé Chóngyuán reports: Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with U.S. Presidential Envoy and National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

During the nearly two-hour talks, Scowcroft briefed Qian Qichen on the recent U.S.-Soviet summit held in Malta. Qian Qichen thanked him for the briefing and shared China's views on some international issues with the guest.

The two sides also discussed bilateral relations.

After the talks, Qian Qichen hosted a banquet in honor of Scowcroft and his delegation. Both hosts and guests delivered speeches at the banquet.

Qian Qichen said: "Tonight, we have the opportunity to host a banquet for U.S. Presidential Envoy and National Security Advisor General Brent Scowcroft, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and other American friends. We are very pleased. We extend a warm welcome to the visit of General Scowcroft and his delegation."

Qian Qichen continued: "General Scowcroft is an old friend we are all familiar with. Over the years, at critical moments in the development of Sino-U.S. relations, he has visited China several times, making many contributions to removing obstacles in the two countries' relations and promoting their development. This time, President Bush sent him as a special envoy to China to brief the Chinese leadership on the U.S.-Soviet summit and to exchange views on bilateral relations, which shows President Bush's attention to Sino-U.S. relations. We appreciate this."

When discussing the international situation, Qian Qichen said: "The current international situation is undergoing the most profound changes since the end of World War II. The prospects of these changes and their impact on world peace and human development are of concern to the people of all countries. In this context, I believe that China and the United States should frequently exchange views. A good Sino-U.S. relationship undoubtedly has important significance for world peace and stability."

Qian Qichen finally emphasized: "Despite experiencing many storms, Sino-U.S. relations have continued to develop, fully proving their vitality. Although there are some important differences between us, these differences cannot overshadow our major common interests. As long as both sides make joint efforts, it is completely possible to maintain our respective positions while safeguarding our common interests. To find a way to overcome the current difficulties, we should strengthen contact and communication. We believe that this visit by General Scowcroft will help us increase mutual understanding, help us overcome difficulties, resolve differences, and restore and develop Sino-U.S. relations as soon as possible."

Scowcroft, during his toast, said: "Today, my colleagues and I are here as friends to resume our important dialogue on international issues that are of great concern to both our countries. We believe that this dialogue will promote peace, stability, and prosperity in Asia and the world."

When discussing the U.S.-Soviet summit, Scowcroft said: "Last weekend, in another part of the world, President Bush and Gorbachev held an important meeting. Subsequently, President Bush sent me to China to brief our Chinese hosts on the situation in Malta."

Scowcroft talked about Sino-U.S. relations, saying, "We are also here today to inject new momentum and vitality into our bilateral relations and to seek new areas of consensus—economic, political, and strategic. We are here to reduce the negative impacts in our relations." Scowcroft emphasized: "The President's strong wish is that this meeting with the Chinese side will make progress and lay the foundation for the solutions we seek."

Scowcroft expressed that during this meeting, we will seek to outline the broad areas where we can reach consensus. At the same time, we will also identify areas of disagreement. The sooner we complete this task, the better. In the past, when we worked together, we achieved a lot. We must persist, and now more than ever.

After the banquet, Qian Qichen and Scowcroft held another round of talks on major issues of common concern. The talks were beneficial and constructive.

The talks and banquet were conducted in a friendly and candid atmosphere.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Sidney Eagleburger attended the talks.

    钱外长同美国总统特使会谈时指出
    中美双方应加强接触互相沟通
    本报北京12月9日讯　记者何崇元报道：中国外交部长钱其琛今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆同美国总统特使、总统国家安全事务助理布伦特·斯考克罗夫特举行了会谈。
    在近两个小时的会谈中，斯考克罗夫特向钱其琛通报了不久前在马耳他举行的美苏首脑会晤的情况，钱其琛对他的通报表示感谢，并向客人介绍了中国对一些国际问题的看法。
    双方还谈了双边关系问题。
    会谈结束后，钱其琛设宴欢迎斯考克罗夫特一行，宾主都在宴会上发表了讲话。
    钱其琛说：“今天晚上，我们有机会设宴款待美国总统特使、总统国家安全事务助理斯考克罗夫特将军、伊格尔伯格副国务卿以及其他美国朋友，感到非常高兴。对斯考克罗夫特将军一行的访问，我们表示热烈的欢迎。”
    钱其琛接着说：斯考克罗夫特将军是我们大家都很熟悉的老朋友。多年来，他在中美关系发展中的关键时刻，曾数次访华，为消除两国关系的障碍，推动两国关系的发展，作出了许多贡献。这次布什总统派他作为特使来华，向中国领导人通报美苏首脑会晤情况，并就双边关系问题交换意见，说明了布什总统对中美关系的重视，我们对此表示赞赏。
    在谈到国际形势时，钱其琛说：当前国际形势正在发生着战后最深刻的变化。这种变化的前景和它对世界和平和人类发展的影响，为各国人民所关心。我认为，在这种情况下，中美双方应该经常交换意见。良好的中美关系无疑对于世界的和平与稳定具有重要的意义。
    钱其琛最后强调：中美关系几经风雨，仍能始终向前发展，充分证明它是富于生命力的。尽管我们之间存在着一些重要的分歧，但是，这些分歧不可能抹杀我们之间的重大共同利益。只要双方共同努力，完全可以做到既保持各自的立场而又维护双方的共同利益。为了能够找到克服目前困难的途径，我们应该加强接触，互相沟通。我们相信，这次斯考克罗夫特将军访华，必将有助于我们增进相互了解，有助于克服困难，消除分歧，使中美关系早日得到恢复和发展。
    斯考克罗夫特祝酒时说：“我和我的同事们今天作为朋友来到这里，就我们两国都极为关心的国际问题，来恢复我们之间的重要对话。我们认为，这种对话能促进亚洲和世界的和平、稳定与繁荣。
    在谈到美苏首脑会晤时，斯考克罗夫特说：“上周末，在世界的另一个角落布什总统和戈尔巴乔夫举行了重要会谈。随后布什总统指使我到中国来，向我们的中国主人通报马耳他会谈的情况。”
    斯考克罗夫特谈到了中美关系，他说，“我们今天来，还为我们的双边关系注入了新的推动力和活力，并寻求双方意见一致的新领域——经济、政治和战略。我们是为减少我们关系中的消极影响而来的。”斯考克罗夫特强调说：“总统的强烈愿望是这次同中方的会谈取得进展，并为我们所寻求的解决办法打下基础。”
    斯考克罗夫特表示，在这次会谈中，我们将寻求勾划出我们有可能达成一致意见的广泛领域。同时也找出那些有分歧的领域。我们越早完成这个任务越好。在过去，当我们一起努力时，我们取得了不少成绩。我们双方必须坚持不懈，现在更应如此。
    晚宴后，钱其琛和斯考克罗夫特又就共同关心的重大问题举行了小范围会谈。会谈是有益的和具有建设性的。
    会谈和宴会是在友好、坦诚的气氛中进行的。
    中国副外长刘华秋、美国副国务卿劳伦斯·西德尼·伊格尔伯格等参加了会谈。
