The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory has written a good chapter on strict management, achieving remarkable results.

Some enterprises also emphasize strict management, but they have not truly implemented it. Management is scattered, and labor discipline is lax. The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory has succeeded in being strict, and the reasons for this success can be found in this report.

Firstly, they grasped the key to being strict: leaders lead by example, strictly demanding of themselves and ensuring that they practice what they preach. They are meticulous, and the masses both hear their words and see their actions. In this way, the power of example is fully demonstrated.

Of course, to be strict in a way that workers accept, the foundation must be fairness. Whether actions are for the public good or for personal gain is the standard of right and wrong. Prioritizing national and collective interests helps to unify thoughts; at the same time, treating everyone equally without exception. From leaders to workers, everyone is held to strict standards, forming a culture of strictness that becomes a voluntary action.

Being strict does not mean there are no boundaries. Like the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, being strict in a reasonable and legal manner is the art of strictness. From the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, it can be seen that mastering the art of strictness gives the enterprise's management great hope.

Currently, during the rectification and reorganization, enterprises face many difficulties. To overcome these difficulties, the approach taken by the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory is worth emulating by some enterprise leaders.

### “严”的学问

    “严”的学问
    桂莲
    张家口卷烟厂从严治厂，做了一篇好文章。
    有些企业，也讲从严治厂，但并没有“严”起来，管理分散，劳动纪律松弛。张家口卷烟厂“严”出了效果，原因何在？读了这篇报道，可以找到一些答案。
    首先抓住“严”的关键：领导以身作则，严格要求自己，让别人做到的事情自己先做到，一丝不苟，让群众听其言又观其行。如此，榜样的力量得以充分发挥。
    当然，要“严”得职工服气，基础是出以公心。为公还是为私，这是是非的标准，以国家利益、集体利益为重，思想就比较容易统一；同时，一视同仁，概莫例外。从领导到职工，人人要求“严”，就形成“严”的风气，变为自觉的行动。
    说“严”，并非没有边际，像张家口卷烟厂那样，“严”得合情、合理，“严”得合法，这就是“严”的艺术。从张家口卷烟厂可以看出，“严”的学问做好了，企业的管理就大有希望。
    当前，在治理整顿中，企业面临不少困难。要克服困难，张家口卷烟厂的做法，是很值得一些企业领导借鉴的。
