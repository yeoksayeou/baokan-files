Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 2nd.

Two long-standing naval cultural service teams active along the vast coastline have been praised by leaders of the Central Military Commission. Comrade Yang Baibing inscribed the words: "Sea-borne Cultural Cavalry" for the teams.

These two teams, composed of officers and soldiers from the Qingdao and Experimental Bases of the Navy, have consistently adhered to the principle of "performing for the troops and singing for the troops." In recent years, they have traveled to islands, mountains, and ships, covering a distance of 20,000 kilometers, and performed over 150 shows for frontline officers and soldiers. They have also helped deliver cultural equipment and books, repaired televisions, and trained cultural and sports cadres. Leaders of the Military Commission, including Liu Huaqing and Yang Baibing, have successively watched their performances.
