The Lake Region Five Provinces Blood Prevention Work Conference called for everyone to take action to drive out the "plague" again. Li Tieying demanded that real work be done for the people in the epidemic areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 15th - Reporter Zhao Xiangru reports: The State Council's conference on blood prevention work in the five provinces of the lake region concluded successfully today in Nanchang. Mobilizing the entire population to drive out the "plague" again has become the unanimous resolution of all representatives attending the conference.

Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor, attended today's meeting and delivered an important speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Li Tieying fully affirmed the achievements of blood prevention work, while also pointing out that the current blood prevention tasks are still quite arduous. He hopes that the leaders of the epidemic provinces and cities and the responsible officials in charge of blood prevention work will strive to achieve the following:

1. Raise awareness and unify thinking. It is necessary to seriously overcome the complacency and laxity in the treatment of schistosomiasis.
2. Strengthen leadership and organizational implementation. It is necessary to improve the blood prevention system. In the future, the State Council will hold an annual five-province blood prevention conference, with other provinces and cities with schistosomiasis also participating, to check and implement the blood prevention work policy, summarize work, exchange experiences, and deploy the next phase of work.
3. Formulate plans and implement tasks. Make efforts to implement the spirit of Jiang Zemin's letter to the conference and Li Peng's inscription, aiming to basically control schistosomiasis within five years and consolidate the results in the following five years. It is necessary to focus on mobilizing the masses to launch several annihilation campaigns.
4. Rely on science and technology and rely on the masses. It is necessary to establish a snail eradication blood prevention team.
5. Strengthen legal construction and propaganda and education.
6. On the issue of funds, it is necessary to advocate and carry forward the spirit of communism. The principle of tightening belts and thrift in running enterprises is also the principle for large-scale schistosomiasis prevention and treatment.

More than 130 representatives attending the meeting also conducted on-site inspections of snail eradication and blood prevention work in the schistosomiasis epidemic areas during the conference. They also seriously discussed the comprehensive treatment plan for lake region schistosomiasis, the draft of the "Regulations on the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis in the People's Republic of China," and the State Council's decision on strengthening schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work. At the same time, they also proposed corresponding measures and suggestions for improving blood prevention work in their respective provinces and cities after the conference.

    湖区五省血防工作会议号召
    全民动手　再送“瘟神”
    李铁映要求为疫区人民办实事
    本报南昌12月15日电　记者赵相如报道：国务院召开的湖区五省省长血防工作会议今天在南昌市圆满结束。全民齐动手，再次送“瘟神”，已经成了参加这次会议全体代表的一致决心。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映出席了今天的会议，代表党中央、国务院发表了重要讲话。李铁映充分肯定了血防工作取得的成绩，同时也指出目前血防任务还相当繁重艰巨。他希望疫区各省市领导及主管血防工作的负责人要努力做到：一，提高认识、统一思想。对于治理血吸虫病必须认真克服麻痹松懈的思想。二，加强领导，组织落实。要健全血防体制，今后国务院每年要召开一次五省血防会议，其他省市有血吸虫病的也参加，检查落实血防工作方针，总结工作，交流经验，部署下一阶段工作。三，制订规划，落实任务。努力贯彻江泽民总书记给会议的信及李鹏总理题词的精神，做到5年内基本控制血吸虫病，后5年扫尾巩固，要突出发动群众打几场歼灭战。四，依靠科学技术，依靠人民群众。要建立灭螺的血防队伍。五，加强法制建设，加强宣传教育。六，在经费问题上，要提倡和发扬共产主义的奉献精神。过几年紧日子，勤俭办事业的方针，同样也是大规模防治血吸虫病的原则。
    出席会议的130多名代表在会议期间还到血吸虫疫区实地考察了灭螺及血防工作实况。他们还认真地讨论了综合治理湖区血吸虫的方案，《关于中华人民共和国血吸虫病防治条例》（送审稿）以及国务院关于加强血吸虫病防治工作的决定，同时还就会后改进本省市的血防工作提出了相应的措施和建议。
