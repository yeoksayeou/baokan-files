The upcoming national table tennis training work conference in Taiyuan, Shanxi, is expected to bring together experts from various regions. What new developments will this conference bring to the Chinese table tennis community? Recently, the reporter met with Li Fuhong, Director of the Training Bureau of the State Sports Commission and one of the key decision-makers in Chinese table tennis, to discuss the situation.

Li Fuhong said that this conference is very important. Its significance lies in the fact that through this conference, we aim to boost morale, strengthen confidence, unify our understanding, and prepare to face the challenges and tests of the 1990s. He believes that the main issues that need to be addressed in the current table tennis community are: What were the reasons for the failure of the Chinese men's team at the 40th World Table Tennis Championships? Has our traditional straight-bat fast-attack style become outdated? How can Chinese table tennis innovate in training, management, and tactics?

Li Fuhong initially shared his views on these questions. He said, "From the 39th World Table Tennis Championships, where the Chinese men's team won all the men's titles, to the complete failure at the 40th Championships, and from a 5-0 victory over Sweden to a 0-5 defeat, all happened in just two years. The opposing team's main lineup did not change much, and their ages are similar to ours, but their performance changed so dramatically. This is partly due to their improvement, but the main reason should be found in our own training work."

Regarding the tactics, Li Fuhong believes that our traditional straight-bat fast-attack style has not developed much in recent years. The once-effective tactics have gradually been adapted by European players, making it difficult for us. However, this does not mean that the straight-bat fast-attack style should be completely abandoned. He said, "All table tennis styles have their unique characteristics and are constantly improving through mutual competition. Even the chopping style, which was thought to be obsolete after the introduction of the loop drive, still has its place. Chen Xinhua's use of the chopping and attacking combined style to win the World Cup is a good example."

Li Fuhong pointed out that past experiences have shown that when the entire table tennis community unifies its understanding and works in harmony, the sport thrives and achieves remarkable results. Therefore, we must strive to make this national training work conference a success.

Next, Li Fuhong introduced the current situation of the national table tennis training team. He said, "After the Youth Games, a group of young and energetic players have been added to the national team. These newcomers have a solid foundation and potential for technical development. The hope for innovation mainly lies with them. At the same time, the coaching team has also undergone some adjustments and reinforcements. Xu Shaofa continues to serve as the head coach, overseeing the overall training of the men's and women's teams, improving the management and skills of the coaches, and also managing the training of young players according to his own wishes. Xi Enting has been transferred from the women's team to the men's team as the head coach. He previously coached the men's team and is familiar with the situation of key players like Chen Longcan. The women's team head coach is still Zhang Xianlin, who is 49 years old. Additionally, the men's team has added several young coaches, including Cai Zhenhua, Hui Jun, and Li Xiaodong."

Li Fuhong said, "The failure of the men's team at the 40th World Table Tennis Championships is mainly the responsibility of the leadership. We cannot blame the coaches when problems arise; they are still working hard. Currently, the table tennis team faces important tasks such as the Asian Games, and the challenges are significant. We cannot let this advantageous project fall behind. Now, more than ever, we need to work together, mobilize the enthusiasm of coaches and athletes, and uphold the spirit of dedication to the country, to restore the glory of Chinese table tennis."

He concluded by saying, "Maintaining our advantage in table tennis cannot rely solely on the national team; it is more important to build a solid foundation, strengthen the reserve forces, and improve the grassroots level. Recently, old coaches from the national team, such as Zhuang Jiafu, as well as Xu Shaofa, Zhang Xianlin, and Xi Enting, have all gone to various grassroots levels to provide guidance and lectures, introducing the situation in the world of table tennis. Recently, the Chinese Table Tennis Association also organized a national youth competition and training camp. All these measures show that we are determined to face the challenges with practical actions and create a new chapter for Chinese table tennis."

### 重整旗鼓迎接90年代——访中国乒协副主席李富荣

    重整旗鼓迎接90年代
    ——访中国乒协副主席李富荣
    本报记者　刘小明
    听说即将在山西太原召开一次云集各地乒乓专家的全国乒乓球训练工作会议。这预示中国乒乓球界会有哪些新动向呢？记者日前见到国家体委训练局局长、我国乒坛决策人之一的李富荣，请他介绍一些情况。
    李富荣说，这次会议很重要，其重要意义在于通过这次会我们要达到鼓舞士气，增强信心，统一思想认识，迎接90年代挑战和考验的目的。他认为当前乒乓球界需要统一认识的主要问题是：第40届世乒赛我国男队失利症结在哪里？我国传统直拍快攻打法是否已经落后？中国乒乓球在训练、管理和打法上如何创新？
    对这几个问题李富荣初步谈了个人的一点看法。他说，中国男队从第39届世乒赛囊括男子项目所有冠军到第40届全线失利，从胜瑞典队5∶0到0∶5败北，中间只有短短两年时间，对手的主力阵容也无大变化，年龄和我们差不多，战绩却变化如此之大。这里面有人家水平提高的因素，但更主要的原因应该从我们自己的训练工作上找。
    说到打法问题，李富荣认为，我国传统的直拍快攻打法近年来发展不大，原来制胜的法宝逐渐被欧洲选手适应，日子不好过。但是，不能因此而完全否定直拍快攻打法。他说，乒乓球各种打法都有其各自的特点，都是在彼此互相竞争中不断发展完善的。就连弧圈球问世后被认为要遭淘汰命运的削球打法，现在依然有其立足之地。我国的陈新华采用削攻结合打法夺得世界杯赛冠军便是一例。
    李富荣指出，过去的经验表明，当全国乒乓球界上下统一了认识，步调一致时，乒乓事业就兴旺发达，成绩显赫。因此一定力争开好这次全国训练工作会。
    接着，李富荣向记者介绍了国家乒乓球集训队的近况。他说，青运会后一批朝气勃勃的年轻选手充实到国家队，这批新人基础不错，技术发展有潜力，创新的希望主要在他们身上。同时国家队教练班子也作了一些小调整和充实。许绍发继续担任总教练，负责协调男女队全面训练工作，抓好教练员的管理提高，并根据他自己的意愿还要兼管年轻选手的训练。郗恩庭从女队调到男队任主教练，他以前在男队当过教练，对陈龙灿等几名主力队员情况比较熟悉。女队主教练仍由49岁的张燮林担任。另外男队还充实了蔡振华、惠钧、李晓东等几位青年教练。
    李富荣说，第40届世乒赛男队的失利，我们领导负主要责任，决不能出了问题就怪教练，他们还是努力工作的。当前乒乓球队面临亚运会等重要任务，困难不小，我们这个优势项目不能掉下去。现在尤其需要上下同心协力，调动教练员、运动员的积极性，发扬为祖国奉献精神，重振中国乒乓雄风。
    他最后表示，保持乒乓优势光靠国家队支撑不行，更重要的是打好基础，壮大后备力量，提高基层水平。前不久国家队老教练庄家富，以及许绍发、张燮林、郗恩庭等都先后到各地基层辅导讲课，介绍世界乒坛形势。最近中国乒协还专门组织全国青少年调赛和集训。所有这些措施都表明，我们决心用实际行动迎接挑战，开创中国乒乓球运动的新局面。
