    The Zhangjiakou region of Hebei Province has emphasized "large scale and high efficiency" in its autumn and winter agricultural water conservancy construction this year. The region has drawn on past experiences and lessons to implement a "five firsts, five lasts" approach:

    Planning before construction. Before the autumn harvest, agricultural water conservancy construction command centers were established at the county and district levels. The entire region dispatched 1,440 technical personnel to various townships to plan projects and design engineering works. Each project calculated the input of funds, labor, and output benefits, which were then reported step-by-step. Approval from the county and township was required before construction could begin.

    Repair before new construction. This year, the region has repaired 1,015 old wells and equipped 412 wells with pumps. The East-West Canal of the Shandian River in Guyuan County had not been dredged in 20 years. This year, 6,000 people were organized to dredge the canal, increasing the irrigated area by 3,400 mu.

    Land preparation before water supply. Each county has carefully summarized past lessons of "having water but no land" and "having land but no water." They insist on preparing land first in areas with water sources, ensuring that water can reach the fields. They aim to complete one area at a time, matching water and land to maximize benefits.

    Discussion before fundraising. Following the principle of "who benefits, who invests," the masses first engage in democratic discussions to unify their thoughts before raising funds and starting construction. This year, the region has raised 33.48 million yuan for agricultural water conservancy construction, with 10.08 million yuan coming from the masses.

    Inspection before recording work. After completing each project, a team of cadres and technical personnel conducts an inspection according to standards. If the quality is up to standard, the villagers' work is recorded; if not, the work is redone.

    By adopting the "five firsts, five lasts" approach, the Zhangjiakou region has achieved significant results in water conservancy construction. This year, 7,175 projects have been completed, 1.5 million mu of high-yielding fields have been newly built, and 110,000 mu of irrigated land have been added.

    张家口地区农田水利建设不搞“花架子”
    “五先五后”讲效益
    本报讯　河北省张家口地区在今年秋冬农田水利建设中，总结以往的经验教训，提出了“规模要大，效益要高”的要求，严格实行“五先五后”：
    先规划后施工。秋收前，地、县各级都成立了农田水利建设指挥部，全区抽调1440名技术人员分工到各乡规划项目、设计工程。每项工程都计算出投入的资金、劳力和产出的效益，逐级上报，经县乡批准后再组织施工。
    先恢复后新建。今年全区已修复旧井1015眼，机井配套412眼。沽源县闪电河东西灌渠工程20年来没有清过淤，今年组织6000人清淤，可扩大水浇地3400亩。
    先修田后配水。各县认真总结过去“有水没有地”“有地难浇水”的教训，坚持在有水源的地方，围水先整地，水到能浇田，搞一块成一块，水土配套，发挥效益。
    先讨论后集资。群众集资本着“谁受益谁投资”的原则，先经过群众民主讨论，统一思想后再集资开工。今年全区筹集农田水利建设资金3348万元，其中群众集资1008万元。
    先验收后记工。每项工程完成后，由干部和技术人员组成的验收小组按标准验收，质量合格的给村民记工，达不到标准的坚决返工。
    采用“五先五后”的做法，张家口地区水利建设成效可观。今年已完成7175项工程，新建稳产高产田150万亩，新增水浇地11万亩。（马宝山）
