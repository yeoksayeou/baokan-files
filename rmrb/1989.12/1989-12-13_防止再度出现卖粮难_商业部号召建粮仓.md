The Ministry of Commerce today held a press conference, calling for the acceleration of grain storage facility construction. Vice Minister of Commerce He Jihai said that grain storage is a crucial link in the circulation of grain commodities. To adapt to the development of grain production and the state's grain storage needs, and to prevent the recurrence of difficulties in selling grain for farmers and storing grain for the state, effective measures must be taken to strengthen the construction of grain storage facilities.

The Ministry of Commerce provided information indicating that the country currently has over 82 million square meters of grain storage space. A significant portion of this was built in the 1950s, and some even before the founding of the nation. Currently, over 13 million square meters of these facilities are in need of repair or are awaiting decommissioning. In recent years, even under normal circumstances, over 20 billion kilograms of grain have been stored outdoors. With the development of grain production, the amount of grain to be procured in the coming years will continue to increase. If the storage capacity issue is not addressed, it is inevitable that the serious problems of state grain storage difficulties and farmers' difficulties in selling grain will recur. Additionally, storing large quantities of grain outdoors in piles results in high costs, significant losses, and is highly prone to grain spoilage.

Regarding the problems that have arisen in grain storage construction in recent years, He Jihai suggested the following: Grain storage construction should be considered in the same way as grain production development plans, and should be included in the construction plans. The funds for simple grain storage buildings should continue to be managed and used by the central and local grain management departments to improve the efficiency of fund use. A portion of the revenue from the negotiated sales of grain and oil should be used for building storage facilities. Any unit is strictly prohibited from arbitrarily occupying grain storage facilities.

    防止再度出现卖粮难
    商业部号召建粮仓
    本报北京12月12日讯　记者潘岗报道：商业部今天召开新闻发布会，呼吁加紧粮食仓库建设。商业部副部长何济海说，粮食储存是粮食商品流通的中间环节。为了适应粮食生产的发展和国家储粮的需要，防止再度出现农民卖粮难、国家储粮难的问题，需要采取有效措施，加强粮库建设。
    商业部提供的情况表明，全国现有8200多万平方米粮库面积，其中有相当一部分是50年代建筑的，也有的是建国前的，目前需要修理和待报废的就有1300多万平方米。近几年，正常情况下就有200多亿公斤粮食露天存放。随着粮食生产的发展，今后几年粮食收购量还将增加，如不解决储存能力问题，势必还会重复出现严重的国家储粮难、农民卖粮难问题。另外，大批粮食靠露天囤垛储存，费用大、损耗大，也极易造成坏粮。
    针对近年粮库建设中存在的问题，何济海建议：要像制定粮食生产发展计划一样考虑粮库建造问题，把粮库建设纳入基建计划；粮食简易建筑费仍由中央和地方两级粮食主管部门集中管理使用，提高资金的使用效益；从议价粮油销售额中提取一部分收入用于建仓；严禁任何单位擅自挤占粮库。
