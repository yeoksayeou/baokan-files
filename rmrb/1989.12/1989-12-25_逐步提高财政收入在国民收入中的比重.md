The proportion of fiscal revenue in national income refers to the amount of new value created by society that the state collects through various distribution channels from the national income. This proportion to a large extent reflects the scale of the state's concentration of financial resources and is an important indicator of the state's fiscal position and role. Since the founding of the nation, China's fiscal revenue as a proportion of national income has consistently been above 30%. However, in recent years, this proportion has shown a continuous decline, reaching 22% in 1988, a decrease of nearly 10 percentage points from 31.9% in 1978. Compared to other countries, this proportion is not only lower than that of developed capitalist countries with consumption-oriented and welfare-oriented fiscal systems (generally 30%–60%), but also lower than that of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries (generally over 60%), and even lower than the average level of developing countries. This is highly inconsistent with the responsibilities of the Chinese government and the need for sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development. Due to the gradual decline in the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income, the state's macroeconomic regulatory capabilities have gradually weakened, leading to the accumulation of many problems and difficulties in economic work. The Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to gradually increase the proportion of state fiscal revenue in national income, which is a summary of the experiences of economic reform and development over the years.

The issue of declining fiscal revenue as a proportion of national income is a long-standing problem with complex causes. From the perspective of macro-level decision-making, the primary issue is an irrational economic structure. In terms of industrial structure, agriculture, the foundation, is weak, with insufficient investment and slow improvements in labor productivity, failing to meet the needs of national economic development and people's living standards. The development of processing industries has been too rapid, while the development of basic industries has been seriously lagging, leading to imbalances in industrial development and creating bottlenecks. The supply of raw materials, energy, and transportation is severely insufficient, resulting in the ineffective utilization of a large number of machines and equipment, and seriously constraining the development of the entire social economy. In terms of investment structure, there is a rush to start projects and a focus on large-scale construction, leading to non-production investments far exceeding production investments. Additionally, repeated production and construction result in a waste of resources, further exacerbating the irrationality of the industrial structure and the imbalance between economic development in various industries and regions and the supply of raw materials, energy, and transportation. In terms of enterprise organizational structure, due to repeated production and investment, China has too many enterprises of the same type, making it difficult to achieve economies of scale. This irrational economic structure is the cause of China's economic imbalance and insufficient effective supply. China's fiscal revenue is based on economic development, growing with the economy. However, under conditions of irrational structure, the faster the development, the more problems and contradictions arise, and the more severe the consequences. On one hand, this exacerbates the overall shortage of materials, and on the other hand, the utilization rate of existing equipment is very low, with both macroeconomic and microeconomic benefits being poor, and fiscal revenue not keeping pace with the growth of national income.

Another important factor constraining the growth of fiscal revenue is the low economic efficiency of enterprises. In recent years, the average annual growth of fixed assets and working capital for the entire society has been around 16%, but the growth of gross national product has not reached this level. The inevitable trend of technological progress and increased labor productivity is that national economic growth generally exceeds investment growth. For example, from 1951 to 1980, the annual growth of industrial investment in the United States was 2.7%, while industrial production grew by 3.8%; in Japan, it was 11% and 11.4%, respectively; and in the Soviet Union, it was 8.2% and 8.6%, respectively. Another manifestation of the low efficiency of Chinese enterprises is the excessive consumption of resources and the low input-output ratio. Statistics show that China's annual resource input is equivalent to 4.8 times that of France, 4.6 times that of Japan, 4.3 times that of Brazil, and 1.4 times that of India, but the output is very low, only about one-fourth of Japan's. In 1988, the comparable product cost of state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget increased by 12.3%, and the losses of loss-making enterprises increased by 26.6%.

Thirdly, the distribution of national income is overly skewed towards enterprises and individuals, dispersing the initial distribution of national income. In recent years, under the guidance of the idea of decentralization and tax reduction, the distribution pattern of national income has undergone significant changes, with the state's fiscal revenue decreasing and the income of individuals and enterprise collectives increasing. 1988 was a year of overheated economic growth in China. While the value of production, sales revenue, and enterprise profits increased significantly, the corporate income tax paid by collective enterprises increased by only 3.8% compared to the same period last year, while the state-owned enterprises within the local budget decreased by 9.5% compared to the same period last year. In 1986, the proportion of income tax, retained profits, and loan repayments of state-owned enterprises to realized profits was 45%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. In 1987, it was 38%, 40%, and 22%, respectively. In 1988, it was 29%, 45%, and 26%, respectively. In the first seven months of 1989, it was 19.4%, 56.5%, and 24.1%, respectively. On the other hand, with the decrease in the amount of money handed over to the state and the increase in the amount of money retained by enterprises, there is an abnormal increase in the personal income of workers. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, in 1988, the proportion of the average wage income of the entire city to the total cash income was only 59%, meaning that only half of the income came from wage income, while the other half came from various bonuses and other non-wage incomes, resulting in a significant increase in the consumption fund.

Fourthly, with the severe economic environment and the disorder of the economic order, the tax environment and order have been adversely affected, and the work of tax administration by law has been disrupted. Firstly, the phenomenon of local government departments arbitrarily reducing and exempting taxes is relatively common. Some local governments, starting from the development of the local economy, emphasize special circumstances and arbitrarily make adjustments; some enterprise management departments, in order to develop their own system and industry, emphasize the difficulties of enterprise production and operation, ignore the interests of the state, and regard the practice of local authorities arbitrarily reducing and exempting taxes as an "experience" to be promoted. Secondly, the problem of tax evasion is serious. According to statistics and analysis, the tax evasion rate of enterprises is over 50%, and that of individual households and private enterprises is over 80%. From 1985 to 1988, China has conducted four major inspections, uncovering a total of 44 billion yuan in violations and tax evasion. Particularly serious is that some taxpayers actually resist the tax authorities and tax officials in their lawful tax collection work, and tax resistance cases occur from time to time. Due to the disruption of tax administration by law, part of the fiscal funds are lost and leaked, and the taxes that should be collected are not collected in a timely and full manner.

To increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income, during the rectification and adjustment period, it is necessary to adhere to the state industrial policy formulated by the State Council, vigorously adjust the industrial structure and investment structure, improve the economic efficiency of enterprises, improve the distribution system, and strengthen tax collection and administration by law. For this purpose, I suggest considering the following aspects to adjust tax policies and strengthen tax work.

First, gradually change the construction tax on fixed asset investment in real estate investment to be conducive to the adjustment of industrial structure and investment structure, and increase fiscal revenue. In the design of tax rates, the industrial policy should be reflected, and different differential tax rates should be implemented for different investment directions according to the requirements of the industrial development sequence. In tax collection and administration, the source control method should be implemented, and tax collection should be handled at the same time as the approval of investment projects to avoid tax leakage.

Second, improve the current personal income adjustment tax, gradually change the tax collection based on comprehensive income to tax collection based on itemized income. For relevant non-wage incomes, such as contract subcontracting income, labor service income, patent transfer income, etc., they should be taxed item by item, and a personal income declaration system should be established accordingly, and heavy penalties should be imposed on tax evaders. On the basis of production development and improvement of labor productivity, the current bonus tax and wage adjustment tax should be further improved to adjust and control the excessive distribution of national income towards individuals and the rapid growth of the consumption fund.

Third, determine the substantive status of state-owned resources, gradually expand the scope of resource tax collection, change the current situation of free use of state-owned resources, and increase fiscal revenue. At the same time, the current resource tax collection method should be studied, and the progressive tax collection based on excess rates should be changed to a method of tax collection based on quantity and price outside the price. It is also possible to delegate part of the tax collection power, allowing local governments to levy local resource taxes according to local resource conditions and regulatory needs.

Fourth, rectify the tax environment, regulate the tax order, strengthen tax administration by law, and plug tax leakage. It is necessary to follow the principle of "unified tax law and decentralized tax power" determined by the State Council, seriously clean up the arbitrary reduction and exemption of taxes, strictly prohibit tax evasion, and promote tax collection and administration reform. Change the current practice of one person in charge of tax collection, tax management, and tax inspection, and establish a tax collection model that separates tax collection, tax management, and tax inspection. Grant the tax authorities the necessary tax collection and administration powers, quickly establish tax security agencies, improve tax inspection agencies, set up special tax courts, and establish tax appeal committees.

    逐步提高财政收入在国民收入中的比重
    郑琦
    财政收入在国民收入中的比重，是指国家财政通过各种分配手段，直接筹集来自国民收入所体现的全社会新创造价值的多少。这个比重在很大程度上说明了国家集中财力规模的大小，是反映国家财政地位与作用的重要依据。建国以来，我国财政收入在国民收入中的比重，一直在30％以上，近几年来却出现了持续下降的局面，到1988年，财政收入在国民收入中的比重已从1978年的31.9％下降为22％，10年降低了近10个百分点。与世界上其它国家相比，不仅低于消费型财政和福利型财政的发达资本主义国家（一般为30％—60％），也低于苏联和东欧一些国家（一般为60％以上），甚至低于发展中国家的平均水平。这与我国政府所担负的职责和保持经济持续、稳定、协调地发展是极不适应的。由于财政收入在国民收入中的比重逐步下降，在经济运行中的宏观调控能力逐渐减弱，以至在经济工作中积累下许多问题和困难。党的十三届五中全会确定，要逐步提高国家财政收入在国民收入中的比重，这是多年来经济改革与发展的实践经验总结。
    财政收入在国民收入中的比重下降问题，是多年形成的，原因也是很复杂的。从宏观决策角度看，首先是经济结构不合理。在产业结构方面表现为，农业这个基础很薄弱，投入不足，劳动生产率提高缓慢，跟不上国民经济发展和人民生活的需要；加工工业发展过快，基础工业严重滞后，造成产业的不平衡发展，形成发展的“瓶颈”；原材料、能源、交通运输业供给严重短缺，一方面使大量的机器、设备无法有效利用，另一方面严重制约了整个社会经济的发展。在投资结构方面表现为，争相上项目，大搞基建，造成非生产性投资大大高于生产性投资，同时重复生产、重复建设又造成大量的资源浪费，进一步加剧产业结构的不合理，加剧了各行业、各地区的经济发展与原材料、能源、交通运输业供不应求的矛盾。在企业组织结构方面，由于重复生产、重复投资，我国同类企业过多，难以形成规模效益。这种经济结构的不合理，是造成我国经济比例失调和有效供给不足的原因。我国的财政收入是建立在经济发展基础上，随着经济的发展而增长的，但在结构不合理的情况下，发展速度越快，带来的问题和矛盾也越多，后果也越严重。一方面加剧了物资的总量短缺，另一方面现有的设备利用率很低，经济的宏观效益和微观效益都很差，财政收入不能与国民收入的增长而同步增长。
    其次，制约财政收入增长的另一个重要原因，是企业的经济效益较低。这几年全社会固定资产和流动资金的投入，平均每年增长16％左右，而国民生产总值的增长却没有达到这个水平。科技进步和劳动生产率不断提高所形成的必然趋势，是国家经济增长一般高于投资增长。比如在1951年至1980年间，美国工业投资额年增长2.7％，工业生产增长3.8％，日本为11％与11.4％，苏联为8.2％与8.6％。我国企业效益不高的另一表现，是资源消耗过大，投入与产出的比例较低。据统计，我国每年的资源投入相当于法国的4.8倍、日本的4.6倍、巴西的4.3倍、印度的1.4倍，但产出却很低，只相当于日本的1／4左右。1988年预算内国营工业可比产品成本上升12.3％，亏损企业的亏损额上升26.6％。
    其三，国民收入分配过分向企业和个人倾斜，分散了国民收入的初次分配。近几年在放权让利和减税让利的思想指导下，国民收入分配格局发生了重大变化，国家财政所得减少了，劳动者个人和企业集体所得增加了。1988年是我国经济过热增长的年份，在产值、销售收入和企业实现利润大幅度增长的同时，集体企业上缴国家的所得税仅比上年同期增长3.8％，地方预算内国营企业却比上年同期下降9.5％。1986年国营企业上缴所得税、留利和还贷占实现利润的比例分别为45％、36％、19％，1987年则分别为38％、40％、22％，1988年分别为29％、45％、26％，1989年1—7月分别为19.4％、56.5％、24.1％。在上缴国家财政下降、企业留利增长的另一面，是职工个人收入的不正常增长。据北京市统计局统计，1988年全市人均工资收入占全部现金收入的比重只有59％，就是说收入只有一半来自工资性收入，另一半则来自其它各项工资外的奖金等收入，以致造成消费基金大幅度增长。
    其四，伴随经济环境严峻和经济秩序混乱，对税收环境与秩序产生了不利的影响，以法治税的工作受到干扰。首先是地方政府部门越权减免税收的情况比较普遍。有些地方政府从发展本地经济出发，强调特殊，任意搞变通；有些企业主管部门为了本系统、本行业的发展，片面强调企业生产经营困难，忽视国家的利益，把一些地方越权减免税的做法视为“经验”加以推广。其次是偷漏税问题严重。据统计分析，目前企业的偷漏税面在50％以上，个体户和私营企业的偷漏税面要在80％以上。从1985年到1988年，我国已连续搞了四次大检查，共查出违纪金额和偷税漏税440亿元。尤其严重的是，某些纳税人竟然对抗税务机关和税务干部的依法征税工作，抗税案件时有发生。由于以法治税工作受到干扰，一部分财政资金撒漏和流失，该征的税收未能及时足额征收上来。
    提高财政收入在国民收入中的比重，在治理整顿中要坚持贯彻国务院制定的国家产业政策，大力调整产业结构和投资结构，提高企业的经济效益，完善分配体制，加强税收的征管和以法治税工作。为此，我认为可以考虑在下列几个方面调整税收政策，加强税收工作。
    第一，逐步改变对固定资产投资中的土建投资征收的建筑税，使之有利于产业结构和投资结构的调整，增加财政收入。在税率的设计上要体现产业政策，按照产业发展序列的要求对不同投向的投资，实行不同的差别税率。在税收的征管上要实行源泉控制的办法，在审批投资项目的同时办理纳税，避免税收的跑冒滴漏。
    第二，完善现行个人收入调节税，逐步把按综合收入征税改为按分项收入征税。对有关工资以外的收入，如承包转包收入、劳务报酬收入、专利转让收入等，都按次征收，并相应建立个人收入申报制度，对偷漏税者施以重罚。在生产发展和提高劳动生产率的基础上，进一步改进现行的奖金税和工资调节税，调节和控制国民收入分配过分向个人倾斜和消费基金的过快增长。
    第三，确定国有资源的价值实体地位，逐步扩大资源税的征收范围，改变目前国有资源无偿使用的状况，增加财政收入。同时要研究现行资源税的征税办法，把按超率累进征税改为实行从量定额、价外征收的办法征税。还可考虑下放一部分征税权，允许地方政府根据本地资源条件和调控需要开征地方资源税。
    第四，治理税收环境、整顿税收秩序，强化以法治税，堵塞跑冒滴漏。要按照国务院确定的“税法必须统一、税权不能分散”的原则，认真清理越权减免税，严格制止偷税漏税；推行税收征管改革、改变现行一员到户、征管查一人负责的征管办法，建立税款征收、税务管理和纳税检查相分离的征管模式；赋予税务机关必要的征管权限，尽快建立税务治安机构，健全税务检查机构，试办专门的税务法庭，成立税收复议委员会等。
