On November 11, Xiaoyongwen, a farmer and Communist Party member from Shengli Village, Wudugang Township, Dongfeng County, Jilin, returned from Changchun after seeking medical treatment. The doctor's diagnosis was grim: late-stage lymphoma, untreatable.

On the way back, he encountered his third brother, Xiaoyongquan, who was driving a horse-drawn cart to deliver grain to the county. Xiaoyongwen immediately asked, "Have you delivered my contracted grain?" Xiaoyongquan replied, "I'll make another trip and then deliver yours." Xiaoyongwen was pleased.

That evening, the village party branch secretary, Wang Fulin, visited Xiaoyongwen and advised him to rest and recuperate. Xiaoyongwen repeatedly told Wang, "I am a party member. I will definitely complete my contracted grain quota and will not hold back the entire village." Wang was moved to tears.

Unfortunately, two days of heavy rain and snow followed. Xiaoyongquan was concerned that the grain depot might not be open and that the grain might not fill a cart, so he did not go to deliver the grain. Xiaoyongwen grew anxious and would remind his brother every time he came to visit: "Hurry up and deliver my contracted grain, don't miss the deadline."

On the morning of November 17, at 7 a.m., Xiaoyongquan came to visit his younger brother. At this point, Xiaoyongwen was in a state of delirium, his eyes tightly shut, and he could barely speak. Xiaoyongquan leaned down and softly said, "Today, I will deliver your grain." Xiaoyongwen, with great effort, opened his eyes, and a faint smile appeared on his face as he nodded.

Xiaoyongwen made his final contribution to the party and the state. Four hours after his brother left, Xiaoyongwen peacefully departed from this world at the age of 34.

Xiaoyongquan stated that he would also deliver his younger brother's contracted corn to the state on time and in full. (December 5, Jilin Daily)

Wang Zhongyi Captures Over a Thousand Thieves in 26 Years

Wang Zhongyi, who appears unremarkable and has a frail physique, has relied on his integrity to capture over a thousand pickpockets on public buses in his 26-year career as a criminal investigator. In just the previous year, he personally apprehended 126 criminals, ranking first in the Public Transportation Bureau.

In January of the previous year, a fellow accomplice of a detained criminal approached Wang Zhongyi, offering him 2,000 yuan to release the criminal. Wang Zhongyi, of course, refused. The man immediately glared menacingly: "Watch out for your wife and children!" Wang Zhongyi slammed his fist on the table: "I am not afraid of evil, I am waiting!"

In May of the previous year, at the 20th bus stop, Wang Zhongyi noticed a man holding a child who, as the bus arrived, pushed and shoved with the crowd but did not get on the bus. When this person used the child as a cover and just pulled out an old man's wallet, Wang Zhongyi stepped forward. The thief had no choice but to hang his head in defeat.

Wang Zhongyi was awarded a first-class merit by the Municipal Public Security Bureau last year and was named a municipal labor model this year. However, his photograph cannot be displayed on the honor roll or in the newspapers, because he still has many years ahead of him, and he will continue to deal with criminals!

    农民党员肖永文的最后奉献
    11月11日，吉林东丰县五道岗乡胜利村农民、共产党员肖永文拖着虚弱的身躯从长春看病归来。大夫给他的诊断是：淋巴癌晚期，无法治疗。
    路上，他遇见赶着马车往县城送粮的三哥肖永全，马上问：“我的定购粮送了没有？”三哥答：“我再送一趟，完了就给你送。”他很高兴。
    当晚，村党支部书记王福林去看望肖永文，劝他好好养病。他却一再对王书记说：“我是党员，定购粮任务肯定完成，决不拖全村的后腿。”说得王福林眼泪直往下掉。
    不料，连续两天，雨雪交加。肖永全怕粮库不开囤，加上粮食不够一车，就没去送粮。肖永文急了，每当哥哥来看他，都要催促一番：快把我的定购粮送去，别误了日期。
    11月17日早7时，肖永全又来看望弟弟。此时，肖永文已处于弥留状态。双目紧闭，连话都说不出了。肖永全俯下身去，轻声说：“今天我给你送粮。”肖永文听了，吃力地睁开眼睛，脸上露出一丝笑容，点了点头。
    肖永文向党和国家作出了最后一点奉献。哥哥走后4个小时，肖永文就安详地告别了人世，年仅34岁。
    肖永全表示，他还要把弟弟的定购玉米也如数、按期卖给国家。（12月5日《吉林日报》）王忠义廿六载擒贼千余名
    貌不惊人体格羸弱的王忠义，凭着一身正气，在26年的刑警生涯中，降伏了千余名在公共电汽车上作案的扒手。仅去年他就当场抓获犯罪分子126名，名列公共交通分局第一。
    去年1月，一个在押犯的同伙找到王忠义，开价两千块，要他放了那犯。王忠义当然不干。那家伙立时眼露凶光：“留神你老婆孩子！”王忠义拍案而起：“我就是不信邪，我等着！”
    去年5月，在20路汽车站，王忠义发现一个抱着孩子的男人，车一来就随着涌向车门的人乱挤，却一直不上车。当此人以孩子作掩护，刚摸出一老人的钱包，王忠义一步上前。男贼不得不耷拉下脑袋认“栽”了。
    王忠义去年荣立市公安局一等功，今年被评为市劳模，可他的照片却不能上光荣榜、登报纸，因为往后的岁月还长呢，他还要与贼打交道哩！（12月8日《北京晚报》赵红文）
