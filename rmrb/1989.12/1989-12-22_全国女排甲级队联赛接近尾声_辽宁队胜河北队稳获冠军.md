The National Women's Volleyball League A-Class Tournament is nearing its end. The Liaoning team defeated the Hebei team 3-0 and has secured the championship. Even if they lose their final match tomorrow against the Shanghai team 0-3, it will not affect this powerful team's defense of their title.

In the Jiangmen competition area, the August First team today won 3-1 against the Sichuan team, and the Shanghai team won 3-0 against the Zhejiang team. These two winning teams, along with the Hebei team, are expected to vie for the remaining top four positions.

In the Kaiping competition area, the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team lost 1-3 to the Jiangxi team, confirming their last place among the 20 A-Class teams.

    全国女排甲级队联赛接近尾声
    辽宁队胜河北队稳获冠军
    本报广东江门12月21日电　全国女排甲级队联赛今天在江门和开平两赛区进行了又一轮交锋。辽宁队以3∶0战胜河北队后，已经稳获冠军。即使明天最后一战以0∶3败给上海队，也不影响这支实力雄厚的队伍蝉联冠军。
    江门赛区的八一队今天以3∶1胜四川队，上海队3∶0胜浙江队，这两支胜队与河北队一起，可望排列在前四名的其他座次上。
    开平赛区的沈阳体院队以1∶3负于江西队后，肯定在全部20支甲级队中排名最末。
