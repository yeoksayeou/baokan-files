Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th - (Reporter Chen Yun) The reporter learned from the National Leading Group for Company Rectification and Cleanup that four inspection teams, composed of National People's Congress representatives, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members, and members of various democratic parties, will depart on December 13th to Jiangsu, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Jilin provinces. Their mission is to supervise, inspect, and guide the rectification and cleanup of companies in those provinces.

This is the first batch of inspection teams dispatched by the National Leading Group for Company Rectification and Cleanup to local regions. Previously, the leading group had sent three inspection teams to central state organs. By today, these three teams have inspected 24 central state organs and departments.

It is reported that the first batch of inspection teams sent to local regions will listen to the comprehensive work reports from the provincial leading groups for company rectification and cleanup. They will also widely gather opinions and feedback from various sectors of society regarding the rectification and cleanup work in their respective provinces. Additionally, they will conduct in-depth inspections and thematic research on key units, key companies, and key issues.

This afternoon, Vice Premier and Deputy Head of the National Leading Group for Company Rectification and Cleanup Luogan held a farewell ceremony for the departing inspection team members at the Great Hall of the People. He expressed gratitude on behalf of the State Council and the National Leading Group for Company Rectification and Cleanup to the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and various democratic parties for their support in the company rectification and cleanup work.

Luogan said that the Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Decision on Further Rectification and Cleanup of Companies" nearly four months ago. In this period, progress has been made in dissolving and merging companies, investigating illegal cases, and building legal frameworks. However, there is still a significant gap between the current situation and the requirements set by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Luogan urged the inspection team members to boldly supervise and guide, and to overcome various interferences and obstacles. He stated that if the inspection teams encounter any resistance from central state organs and departments, they should record it accurately and report it to the leading group. The leading group will respond and handle the issue within three days.

    清理整顿公司巡视组
    赴苏鄂陕吉四省工作
    据新华社北京12月12日电　（记者陈芸）记者从全国清理整顿公司领导小组获悉，由全国人大代表、政协委员和各民主党派成员组成的4个清理整顿公司巡视组，13日将分赴江苏、湖北、陕西和吉林省，督促、检查、指导那里的清理整顿公司工作。
    这是以全国清理整顿公司领导小组名义向地方派出的第一批巡视组。在此之前，领导小组曾向中央国家机关派出3个巡视组，到今天为止，这3个巡视组已巡视了24个中央国家机关和部门。
    据介绍，第一批派往地方的巡视组，将听取省清理整顿公司领导小组的全面工作汇报，广泛了解社会各界对本省清理整顿工作的反映和意见，并对重点单位、重点公司、重点问题进行重点检查和专题调研。
    今天下午，国务院秘书长、全国清理整顿公司领导小组副组长罗干在人民大会堂为即将出发的巡视组全体成员送行。他代表国务院和全国清理整顿公司领导小组对全国人大、政协和各民主党派对清理整顿公司工作的支持表示感谢。
    罗干说，中央、国务院作出《关于进一步清理整顿公司的决定》已近四个月了，这一段撤并公司、查处违法案件和法规建设已经取得了初步进展，但与党中央、国务院的要求差距还很大。罗干希望巡视组的同志大胆监督、指导，排除各种干扰和阻力。他表示，如果巡视组发现有来自中央国家机关和部门的阻力，请如实记录在案，上报领导小组，领导小组将在三天之内作出答复和处理。
