Edition: 6

	These one-eyed small coal mines, which are equipped poorly and lack safety facilities, number more than sixty in Yiyang County under our city's jurisdiction. Accidents are frequent in these small mines. In the first ten months of this year, eighteen people died in these one-eyed coal mines in the county. After the relevant departments ordered the closure of these one-eyed coal mines, some mine owners defied the order and reopened the mines, sending workers down the pits again. They are simply putting money above lives!

    危险乎，独眼小煤窑！
    像这样设备简陋而又缺乏安全设施的独眼小煤窑，在我市所辖的宜阳县有六十多家。这些小煤窑事故不断，今年头十个月里，全县就有十八人死在独眼小煤窑里。有关部门勒令封闭独眼小煤窑后，但一些窑主违令启封，又安排人下井作业，简直是要钱不惜命！
