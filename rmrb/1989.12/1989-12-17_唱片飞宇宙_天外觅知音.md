The spacecraft "Voyager 2" recently completed its mission to explore Neptune. The cameras, infrared detectors, and light polarization instruments on the spacecraft have all been turned off. Although it will lose contact with Earth and begin its journey out of the solar system into the vast expanse of the universe, the spacecraft still has one final mission: to introduce Earth's information to any potential extraterrestrial beings it might encounter.

Inside the spacecraft is a gold-plated copper record, along with a diamond stylus. The record and stylus are placed in an aluminum case, with the lid engraved with scientific diagrams explaining how to use them. Scientists hope that the spacecraft, during its endless journey, will be intercepted by intelligent beings in the universe. These extraterrestrials would then be able to learn about Earth from the record and possibly establish contact with humanity.

To craft this first message from Earth to the universe, a team consisting of astronomer Carl Sagan, artist Linda Salzman, musician Valeri Lisitsa, and social activist Ann Druyan was tasked with determining the content of the two-hour record.

The first section, approximately 18 minutes long, begins with greetings from then-President Carter and a message from United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. This is followed by greetings in 60 different languages spoken on Earth, including Mandarin and Chaozhou dialect. If extraterrestrials can understand any of these languages, the effort will not be in vain. The section concludes with the song of the humpback whale, recognized by zoologists as the "songbird" of the animal kingdom.

The second section, lasting 12 minutes, uses sounds to convey the 4.5 billion-year history of Earth. It includes the simulated sounds of Earth orbiting the Sun, the rumbling of tectonic activity, the sound of heavy rain, the gurgling of flowing water, the howling of cold winds, and the rustling of leaves. Finally, it captures the sounds of human activity, such as heartbeats, muscle contractions, hunger pangs, and the "noise" representing human technological achievements, like the hum of machinery, the roar of airplanes, the rush of cars, and the ticking of instruments.

The third section features 27 musical pieces representing the rich and diverse cultures of Earth, taking up 90 minutes. Music is a universal language, and it is believed that extraterrestrials might also understand it. Three works by Bach are included, with the first movement of his "Brandenburg Concerto No. 2" chosen as the opening piece. Its joyful mood is considered suitable for greetings. Despite some objections, the jazz pioneer Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" was selected, and "The House in New Guinea" is considered one of the oldest musical pieces. There is also the serenade "Deep in the Night," played on the guitar without any lyrics.

Among these, there is a solo piece for the ancient Chinese zither called "Flowing Water," recommended as a "meditation on the resonance between human consciousness and the universe," best representing China's ancient and enduring culture. The final piece is the fifth movement of Beethoven's String Quartet No. 13 in B-flat major. The team believes that this beautiful, lyrical piece expresses human pain and hope, with profound and mysterious meanings, making it worthy of extraterrestrial contemplation.

The record has been specially treated to ensure a lifespan of one billion years. Whether the spacecraft will be discovered by intelligent beings in the universe and whether they will be interested in the record, listening attentively, remains to be seen.

    唱片飞宇宙
    天外觅知音
    太空飞船“旅行者二号”最近完成对海王星的考察任务后，飞船上的摄像机、红外探测仪和光偏振仪均已关闭，虽然它将和地球失去联系，开始飞离太阳系，进入无穷无尽的宇宙空间，然而这只飞船还有最后一项任务，将我们地球的信息介绍给可能遇到的“外星人”。
    飞船里有一张铜制镀金的唱片，还配有金钢钻的唱针，唱片和唱针安放在一只铝盒内，盒盖上刻着用科学图形表达的使用说明，科学家希望飞船在茫茫无期的旅途中有幸为宇宙中智能生物所截获，那么这些外星人就能从唱片中了解地球，甚至进一步与人类建立联系。
    为了写好这封人类从地球发出的第一封信，由天文学家卡尔·撒根，艺术家林达·苏尔兹曼，音乐家弗·利斯和社会活动家安·德鲁杨组成的四人小组，负责确定这张可以放送二小时的唱片的内容。
    第一组内容约为18分钟，先是当时任职的卡特总统的问候语和联合国秘书长瓦尔德海姆的致意词，接着就是地球上六十种语言的“问好”，包括我国的普通话和潮州话。要是外星人能听懂其中的一种，就不枉此举了。最后录上了座头鲸的歌唱声，动物学家公认它是动物中的歌星。
    第二组仅用12分钟声音表达了地球45亿年的历史，真是长话短说。模拟地球围绕太阳运行的旋转声，地壳隆起的轰鸣声，滂沱大雨声，汩汩流水声，凛冽寒风呼叫声，风吹树叶沙沙声。最后人类出现，心跳声，肌肉收缩声，饥肠辘辘声，还有代表人类科技水平的“噪声”，像机器运转、飞机轰鸣、汽车疾驰、仪表嘀嗒等。
    第三组选用了能代表地球上丰富多采文化的27首乐曲，足足占了90分钟，音乐是全人类的共同语言，相信外星人也能理解。巴赫一人选中三首作品，他的《布拉登堡第二协奏曲》的第一乐章被作为开始曲，大家认为这个乐章的欢乐情绪极适合问候。尽管有人反对，还是选了爵士音乐始祖丘克·贝利的《约翰B，再见》，而《新几内亚人的房子》被认为是最古老的音乐之一，还有小夜曲《黑沉沉的夜》，是吉它弹奏，从头到尾没有一句歌词。
    其中有一首古琴独奏《流水》，推荐者认为这是“人类意识与宇宙共鸣的冥想曲”，最能代表中国古老悠久的文化。压轴的是贝多芬第十三降B调弦乐四重奏的第五乐章，四人小组相信，这首优美的抒情乐曲表达了人类的痛苦和希望，含义深远，高深莫测，最值得让外星人去冥思苦想。
    这张唱片经过特殊处理，保证有十亿年的“使用期”，飞船能否被宇宙的智能生物所发现，能否对唱片感兴趣，洗耳恭听，只能听“天”由命了。
