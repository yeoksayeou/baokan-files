The Mindset of Celebrities
– A Record of Kobayashi Koichi and Ma Xiaochun

“Without a Mind”—on the folding fan in Kobayashi Koichi’s hand, two bold black characters stand out vividly on the pristine fan surface. These two characters hold deep Zen wisdom, making one ponder.

Kobayashi Koichi himself says, “Like most chess players, I have many fans, but I love this fan the most.” From this, I think of the evaluation people give to Kobayashi’s chess style—no style. Perhaps, no style is the most distinctive style, which makes the opponent uncertain and unable to find a way to counter it. Chen Zude, a 9th Dan player, told me, “For Chinese chess players, Kobayashi’s chess is the hardest to deal with. There are few flaws to find, like a thick wall.” For Ma Xiaochun, from the moment he ascended to the Chinese title of Meijin, the desire to break through this wall was so strong, almost uncontrollable. I remember a month ago, Ma Xiaochun told me that he really wanted to win a game against Kobayashi Koichi. In his ten-year chess career, no other match is as important as the China-Japan Meijin Go match against Kobayashi. Is it because Kobayashi Koichi is the top player among the top Japanese players that Chinese players all want to compete with him as a matter of honor? The usually introverted Ma Xiaochun, when talking about the upcoming battle with Kobayashi Koichi, was so excited. Only at this moment could one glimpse the mindset of a professional chess player.

The day after Kobayashi arrived in Beijing, he insisted on not having anyone accompany him, and went alone to the Temple of Heaven Park, quietly walking for a few hours. Does the man who takes “Without a Mind” as his motto want to gain something from the rustling of the pines? This is a mystery, perhaps no one will ever know? Perhaps it is done with “Without a Mind.”

If you only try to understand Kobayashi Koichi’s chess strategy from the surface, you will surely be disappointed. In reality, he is more cunning than any other professional chess player. His formidable and powerful aspect lies precisely in his unwillingness to give an inch. In his first game against Ma Xiaochun, he fully demonstrated this.

Ma Xiaochun is known for his light and agile chess style. At the beginning of the match, he was not constrained by his opponent, sacrificing six stones in the upper left corner to seize the white stones’ lower right corner and gained the advantage of encircling the upper part of the board. Experts praised Black’s 57th move the most, Ma Xiaochun’s talent was fully displayed here, and some experts even commented that it was “earth-shattering.” Ma Xiaochun indeed put his whole heart into this battle. Even his teammates saw his fully focused expression on the closed-circuit TV screen and said it was rare to see.

After the match, Ma Xiaochun told me that he really couldn’t find an opportunity, and he took it as usual.

Seemingly without a mind but actually mindful in every aspect, this is Kobayashi Koichi’s unique quality in chess. On the surface, it seems carefree, but inside, there is a burning desire to break through the thick wall, this is also Ma Xiaochun’s new enlightenment in seeking the highest level of chess.

For Ma Xiaochun’s second game, people do not want to predict but understand the situation is severe. Ma Xiaochun probably understands this more than anyone else. However, regardless of the result, this will be an unforgettable page in his chess career, and it will definitely be a new one.

### 名人的心态——记小林光一和马晓春

    名人的心态
    ——记小林光一和马晓春
    “无心”——小林光一手中的折扇上，两个墨黑的大字在洁白的扇面上赫然醒目。这两字深藏禅机，颇让人玩味。
    小林光一自称：“像大多数棋手一样，我有许多把扇子，但我最喜爱的是这把扇子。”由此，我想到人们对小林棋风的评价——没有风格。也许，无风格即是最具特色的风格，这才让对手捉摸不定而无从下手吧。陈祖德九段和我讲：“对中国棋手来说，小林的棋最难对付，很少能找到破绽，有如一堵厚厚的墙。”对马晓春来讲，当他一登上中国名人宝座的那天起，撞破这堵墙的欲望是如此强烈，而且几乎到了不可遏制的地步。记得一月前马晓春曾和我说，他是太想胜小林光一一盘棋了。在他十几年的棋艺生涯中，没有其它比赛比他与小林对弈的中日围棋名人战更为重要了。是不是由于小林光一是日本超一流棋手中的顶尖人物而使得中国棋手们都想以与他能搏弈一番而当作幸事呢？一惯感情内向的马晓春谈起即将面临的与小林光一的厮杀时，神情是那样激动，只有在此刻才能窥见到一位职业棋手的心态。
    小林到北京的第二天下午，执意不要任何人陪同，一个人来到天坛公园，静静地散了几小时步。以“无心”为座右铭的小林君是否要从松涛林声中获取什么呢？这是一个谜，也许永远无人知晓？也许本身就是以“无心”去做的。
    如果你仅仅从字面上去捉摸小林光一的棋路，准会大呼上当。他实际上比任何一位职业棋手都要工于心计。他的可畏、强大之处正是在于寸土不让。在他和马晓春的第一盘对弈中，他把这一点发挥得淋漓尽致。
    马晓春一向以轻灵腾挪的棋风见长，在比赛一开始的布局中，他也不为对手所牵制，以弃左上角六子换得了夺取白棋的右下角和谋得了在上方的连扳围地的形势。行家们对黑五十七手最为赞赏，马晓春的才气在此显露无遗，甚至有的行家评论为“石破天惊”。马晓春的确全副身心都投入到这场战斗中，连他的队友们从闭路电视的屏幕上看到他那种全神贯注的神态，都说这是少见的。
    马晓春赛后对我说，确实抓不住机会，他以平常心看待这场比赛。
    似无心实是处处有心，这正是小林光一在棋道上的过人之处，表面上看似漫不经心，胸腔里却包容着一团冲破厚墙的生命之火，这也是马晓春寻求棋道最高境界的新悟性吧。
    对马晓春的第二盘棋，人们不愿去预测但都明白形势严峻，马晓春恐怕比任何人更清楚这一点。然而无论结果怎样，这都将在他的棋艺生涯中写下永远难忘的一页，这必定是新的一页。
