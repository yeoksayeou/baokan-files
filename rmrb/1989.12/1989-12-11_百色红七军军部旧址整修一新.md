The Red Seventh Army Headquarters in Baise City has recently been renovated and will officially open to the public on December 11th, marking the 60th anniversary of the Baise Uprising.

Located in the center of Baise City, the Red Seventh Army Headquarters was originally known as the Guangdong East Hall. The building is divided into a main hall and side rooms, covering an area of 1,500 square meters. Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and other comrades spent their time here leading the Baise Uprising and the revolutionary struggles in the Left and Right River regions. In 1961, the Right River Revolutionary Museum was established within the Red Seventh Army Headquarters, collecting and organizing artifacts and materials from the Baise Uprising period. It introduces the glorious history of the various ethnic groups in the Right River region during the New Democratic Revolution and the brilliant achievements of the Baise Uprising. On August 17, 1977, Deng Xiaoping personally inscribed the words "China Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Seventh Army Headquarters."

The renovated Red Seventh Army Headquarters features a revolutionary relic exhibition hall that has been enriched with numerous artifacts and materials. New exhibition rooms have been added, showcasing the Red Seventh Army's campaigns and notable figures.

    百色红七军军部旧址整修一新
    新华社南宁12月10日电  （记者邓国添）广西百色市红七军军部旧址最近修整一新，将于12月11日百色起义60周年之际，正式对外开放。
    坐落在百色市中心的红七军军部旧址，原称百色粤东会馆，馆内分正厅、厢房两部分，占地面积为1500平方米。邓小平、张云逸等同志曾在这里度过了领导百色起义和左、右江根据地革命斗争的峥嵘岁月。1961年，在红七军军部旧址内建立了右江革命文物馆，收集和整理百色起义时期的文物和资料，介绍右江各族人民在新民主主义革命时期的光荣史实，介绍百色起义的光辉业绩。1977年8月17日，邓小平同志亲笔题写了“中国工农红军第七军军部旧址”。
    修整后的红七军军部旧址，革命文物陈列馆里除充实了许多文物和资料以外，又增加了红七军转战南北、红七军人物等新内容的陈列室。
