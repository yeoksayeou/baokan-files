U.S. Secretary of State James Baker said yesterday in West Berlin that the situation in Eastern Europe is changing, and the Cold War era is coming to an end. He advocates for increased Western cooperation to create a "new structure" for the future of Europe.

Baker gave a keynote speech in West Berlin on U.S. European policy at a press conference. He said that establishing a "new structure" for Europe includes two goals: First, as part of the process to overcome Europe's division, there must be a path to overcoming the division of Germany and Berlin; second, the new structure should reflect that the security of the United States and Europe remains interconnected in political, military, and economic aspects.

Baker said that the new role of NATO and a closer relationship between the United States and the European Community should be the foundation of the new Europe. He said that NATO remains the main bridge between the United States and Western Europe. In the context of increasing significance of non-military aspects of European security, NATO can serve as a forum for East-West agreements and can propose initiatives to strengthen political and economic ties with Eastern Europe. He also advocates for a treaty that would allow the United States to formally participate in all institutions of the European Community to strengthen relations between the United States and the EC.

Baker proposed a five-point plan on the issue of German reunification. He said that the United States insists on achieving German reunification as part of the process of European unification. However, this process must be peaceful and democratic, and it should consider the legitimate demands of all participants in the European house. The *Süddeutsche Zeitung* in West Germany believes that Baker's visit to West Berlin shows an attitude of "neither encouraging nor obstructing German reunification," aiming to send a signal that the United States "does not want to leave this matter solely to the Germans."

    美国务卿贝克访问西柏林
    提出欧洲“新结构”设想
    本报波恩12月13日电　记者江建国报道：美国国务卿詹姆斯·贝克昨天在西柏林说，东欧局势发生变化之后，冷战时代行将结束。他主张西方加强合作，为未来的欧洲创造一种“新结构”。
    贝克在西柏林的记者招待会上就美国的欧洲政策作了基调演说。他说，创立欧洲的“新结构”，包含两个目标：第一、作为克服欧洲分裂的进程的一部分必须有一条通向克服德国和柏林分裂的道路；第二、新结构应当反映出在政治、军事和经济方面美国的安全和欧洲的安全仍然联系在一起。
    贝克说，北约的新作用和美国与欧共体更紧密的关系应该是新的欧洲的基础。他说，北约仍然是美国和西欧的主要桥梁。在欧洲安全的非军事方面现在越来越有意义的情况下，北约可以作为东西方达成协议的论坛，可以在加强与东欧的政治和经济联系上提出倡议。他还主张通过一项能使美国正式参加欧洲共同体所有机构的条约来加强美国与欧共体的关系。
    贝克就德国统一问题提出5点计划。他说，美国坚持在欧洲统一进程中实现德国统一的目标。但这个过程必须是和平的、民主的，而且应该考虑到所有欧洲大厦的参与者的合法要求。西德的《南德意志报》认为，贝克来到西柏林表现出“对德国统一既不鼓励也不阻挠”的态度，目的是要发出信号，表明美国“不想把这件事只交给德国人来干”。
