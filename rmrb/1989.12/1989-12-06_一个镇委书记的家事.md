Recently, the Huangzhuang Township Party Committee of our county held a democratic appraisal of party members, and Party Secretary Zhu Zuguang received the highest score. Zhu Zuguang is sincere and diligent in his work, and has been recognized as an advanced worker, outstanding party member, and national model worker in family planning for many years. But who knows how many family difficulties he has overcome to achieve these results?

Zhu Zuguang's wife suffers from schizophrenia and often has episodes, adding a heavy burden to him. Once, Zhu Zuguang went to Hangzhou on a business trip. After his wife had an episode, she wandered off in a confused state. Two days later, Zhu Zuguang returned home, and his two children cried, saying, "Mom went out and hasn't come back. We haven't eaten for two days." Zhu Zuguang arranged for the children and then went out to look for his wife. He searched all night before finally finding her. However, the next day, Hangzhou called to say that Zhu Zuguang was needed to discuss business. To save an enterprise on the brink of collapse, Zhu Zuguang sent his wife and children back to his hometown and rushed to Hangzhou that same afternoon.

The heavy burdens of work and family have taken a toll on Zhu Zuguang's health. He suffers from liver enlargement and a decrease in white blood cells. But he hid his medical leave slips and continued to work, visiting villages and factories, and conducting investigations.

Zhu Zuguang's family is in financial difficulty. His wife's treatment and his children's education all depend on his single salary. He wanted to help his parents but lacked the means. The elderly couple had no complaints and often comforted him. They just hoped to be with their son during the holidays. Last summer, when his mother turned 60, all the relatives came. But at that time, it was the busy season for harvesting, and Zhu Zuguang couldn't leave his work, so he could only wish his mother well in his heart. This spring festival, his mother prepared the New Year's Eve dinner early, waiting for her son to come home. But by nightfall, there was still no sign of Zhu Zuguang. It turned out that while his mother was waiting by the door, Zhu Zuguang was busy mediating a fight between two villages. By the time the situation was under control, it was already midnight when he returned home.

    一个镇委书记的家事
    最近，我县黄宅镇党委举行党员民主评议，党委书记朱祖光得了最高分。朱祖光待人诚恳，工作兢兢业业，多年被评为县先进工作者、优秀党员、全国计划生育先进工作者。可有谁知道，他是克服了多少家庭困难，才取得这些成绩的。
    朱祖光的妻子患精神分裂症，常常发病，给他增添了沉重的负担。有一回，朱祖光去杭州出差。妻子发病后一个人糊里糊涂地走丢了。两天后，朱祖光回到家，两个孩子哭着说：“妈妈出去一直没回来，我们已两天没吃饭了。”朱祖光安排好孩子，便到处寻找妻子。整整找了一夜，他才将妻子找回家。然而第二天，杭州方面又来电话指定要朱祖光去洽谈业务。为了救活濒临倒闭的企业，朱祖光将妻儿送到老家，当天下午就赶去杭州。
    工作和家庭的重担子压垮了朱祖光的身体。他患肝肿大、白血球减少。但他藏起一张张病假条，一直坚持工作，下村进厂，走访调查。
    朱祖光家的经济很困难，妻子治病，子女上学，全靠他一人的工资，他想接济父母双亲，却没有能力。对此，二老毫无怨言，反而还时常安慰他。只是逢年过节，老人很希望与儿子团聚。去年夏天，老母过60岁生日，亲友们都来了。可那时正是“双抢”季节，工作脱不开身，朱祖光只能在心里默祝母亲安康。今年春节，老母亲早早烧好年夜饭，等着儿子去吃团圆饭。可等到天黑，也没见朱祖光的影子。原来，母亲倚门翘望之时，朱祖光正为平息两个村的群众斗殴而奔波，等到事态平息了，他回到家已是深夜12点了。
