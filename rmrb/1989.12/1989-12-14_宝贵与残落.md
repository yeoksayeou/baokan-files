The rain beads sparkle and splash on the umbrella, as the elderly man walks into the community college. As usual, he arrives half an hour early, but the classroom is empty. He feels a tightness in his chest, as if a stone slab is pressing down on him. He enters the restroom, splashes his face with cold water, and massages his chest. Supporting his uncomfortable body, he unconsciously walks into the television room. The screen is showing "The Last Emperor," where Puyi raises his cup to welcome his father, the "Regent," to Changchun. The palace orchestra plays the music. The old man focuses on the violinist. Years ago, he had played in that position, and once he even picked up the baton, conducting "The Emperor's Waltz" in the new palace...

The people watching the TV are filled with hatred, anger, joy, and sentiment for the emperor. No one knows that the emperor's palace musician is sitting among them.

The old man stands up and walks into the classroom. He picks up the chalk and writes on the blackboard: "Lesson 13, Common Japanese Phrases for Negotiations." Then he sits at the desk, waiting for the students to arrive. The wind blows raindrops onto his face, so he closes the glass window, fearing the students might get wet while listening to the lecture. Suddenly, he feels a chill, like snowflakes falling on his neck.

Snowflakes and leaflets fly together. He is dressed in the uniform of the People's Liberation Army, holding a baton adorned with a red tassel, marching at the front of the military band. His conducted "Cavalry March" makes the entry ceremony even more majestic. His long beard is black and slightly curly, his nose is high and straight, and his eyes are double-lidded. His gaze is like the silver keys of a trumpet shining in the sun. Onlookers exclaim, "What a fine bearded gentleman!" A soldier introduces, "He is our famous 'Big Beard' in the army, promoted to the rank of a battalion upon enlistment, eating at the 'middle table'!"

He feels a tightness in his chest again, splashes his face with cold water, massages his chest, and takes a few deep breaths. The bright tiles on the wall reflect the light, making his eyes dizzy. The tiles are like the ice sheets on the Han River in Korea. He carries a backpack, climbing a steep cliff. Enemy planes are diving, and machine guns are sweeping. Under a giant pine tree, he conducts a small band of three people to accompany "Five Songs for the Cook." The old cook from the anti-Japanese war specially steams an egg custard for him to eat, saying, "Big Beard, I didn't expect you to be on the battlefield too. It seems we are all emperors now!"

The students sit neatly in the classroom, including managers, factory directors, section chiefs, workers, and unemployed youth... The lecture begins. The old man plays the role of a Chinese foreign trade representative, and a student plays the role of a Japanese businessman, negotiating the import of a rolling mill. Japanese phrases are exchanged, arguments are polite, and haggling is done with laughter and joy. Finally, the contract is signed, and everyone is happy. The old man's late wife was a Japanese civilian girl, so his Japanese is fluent. The students applaud for this lively lesson.

The rain beads splash on the umbrella again. The old man walks under the silver streetlights in the alley. The streetlights remind him of the lights in a factory warehouse in Northeast China in 1977. He, as the warehouse keeper, settles the last account. The factory leader comes over, "Old Li, are you really going back to Guangzhou?" "Yes. I worked there for over twenty years." "Stay. I'll make sure your policy is fully implemented." "Thank you. My golden years were spent in Guangzhou. My unit, my troupe, my old comrades, and neighbors are all in Guangzhou. I am a 'Hakka' from Guangzhou!"

The old man folds his umbrella and walks into the brightly lit new hotel. He does not enter the new building with the red carpet but steps into an old, dilapidated building that will soon be demolished. He has not moved into the retirement home; his home is still in the two rooms downstairs. One room is made of wooden boards. The kitchen is in the hallway, and the toilet is shared. His former kindergarten teacher, now a retired old wife, greets him, takes the umbrella, and asks, "Still feeling chest pain?" He smiles and shakes his head.

"Come on! Let's go to the hospital!" The old man laughs heartily, "In Korea, with a bowl of fried noodles and a bowl of snow, I was uncomfortable for a week, but I got through it! I'm fine, nothing." He lights a cigarette and enjoys it leisurely. The old Soviet-made refrigerator next to the old sofa seems to say in Russian, "Comrade, are you going to open another class?" "Yes. I need to open this class: Russian. Because many comrades in the district's political consultative conference and the old cadres' bureau want to learn it." The old man once learned music from a "White Russian" and understands Russian.

"Grandpa!" Five boys and girls come in, chirping like birds. The wet red scarves make the old man feel young and lively, as if he were in Korea for the whole winter without taking a bath, and suddenly it was spring, jumping into a clear river for a swim, splashing water with his comrades. He asks his wife to give each child a glass of orange juice, then takes out the "Children's Japanese Textbook." First, he teaches in Cantonese, even saying some colloquial phrases like "湿湿碎" (a small matter); then in Mandarin; finally, he leads the children to sing the famous Japanese poet Abebe's "Autumn Poem"...

The old man sends the children out of the house, out of the brightly lit hotel courtyard.

"Grandpa Li, don't send us anymore, go back!" "Sending you is like taking a walk!" He holds the hands of two children, walks out of the alley, all the way to the bus stop. The children get on the bus, but the old man still stands by the park gate on the street, waving at the children, not stopping. The rain starts again, and the old man stands in the rain, watching the bus turn the corner and disappear...

"One's own youth, one cherishes it; the past joys, the future remnants, the present is more precious." The old man sings "Autumn Poem" in his heart, walking home in the autumn rain. Yes, "the present is more precious!" In a famous film about overseas patriots, he played the role of the art director (he had once served as the art director of the army's opera troupe) and played various roles in several films; he teaches at several units including the district's political consultative conference, the old cadres' bureau, and the community college. "I still have so many precious things to do!" The rain makes the night sky like a large sheet of music paper. He thinks: Write! Hurry up and compose the symphony of my life, "Precious and the Remnants"...

The old man walks home in the rain, his heart filled with determination and a sense of purpose.

    宝贵与残落
    张永枚
    秋雨在伞上亮珠飞溅，打伞的老人走进业余大学。他像往常一样早到了半小时，但授课的教室空无一人。他感到胸闷，像压着石板。走进洗手间，手捧清水洗把脸，捶捶胸；支撑起不舒服的身体，不觉进了电视室。荧屏正在显影
  《末代皇帝》，溥仪举杯恭迎生父“摄政王”驾临长春，宫庭乐队奏起乐曲。老人注目那位小提琴手，当年，他曾在那位置上演奏，有一回还拿起指挥棍，挥手间，《皇帝圆舞曲》缭绕新宫……看电视的人们为皇帝而恨而怒而乐而感慨，谁也不知道身边就坐着皇帝的宫庭乐师。
    老人起身走进教室，拿起粉笔，在黑板上写：“第十三课，洽谈引进时的常用日语”。然后坐在课桌边，等待学生到来。风把雨珠洒到脸上，他关上落地玻璃窗，怕学生听课时淋雨。忽感到凉意，像雪花落在颈上。
    雪花和传单齐飞。他穿着中国人民解放军军装，持着缀有红缨的指挥杖，大步行进在军乐队的最前面。他指挥的
  《骑兵进行曲》使入城式更加威武雄壮。他蓄的连鬓长须，黑亮微带弯曲，鼻梁高而直，双眼睑，目光像太阳下小号的银键闪亮。观者赞叹：“好一个美髯公！”战士介绍：“他是我们军有名的‘大胡子’，一入伍就是营级待遇，吃‘中灶’哩！”
    他又感到胸闷，用清水洗脸，捶捶胸，做了几次深呼吸。墙上嵌的明洁的瓷砖返光，他有些眼花。瓷砖像朝鲜汉江的冰板，他背着背包，爬上一座峭壁。敌机在俯冲，机关炮在扫射。在一棵巨松下，他指挥三个人的小乐队伴奏
  《五唱炊事员》。抗战兵老炊事班长特地用干蛋粉蒸了一碗蛋羹，送给他吃，说：“大胡子，想不到您也上阵地，敢情我们都是皇帝了！”
    学生们端坐在教室，有经理、厂长、科长、工人、待业青年……授课开始。老人扮演一位我国的外贸人员，由一位学生扮演日本企业家，洽谈引进轧钢机。日语你来我往，争论彬彬有礼，讨价还价在笑语欢声中进行，最后是合同签字，干杯，皆大欢喜。老人早逝的前妻是位日本平民姑娘，所以日语娴熟。学生们为这生动的一课鼓掌。
    雨的亮珠又在伞上飞溅，伞下的老人走在小巷的银色路灯下。路灯使他忆起1977年东北一座工厂仓库的灯，他——仓库保管员，算清了最后一笔账。工厂的领导走来：“老李，你真要回广州？”“对。我在那里工作了二十几年。”
  “留下吧，我负责给您完全落实政策。”“谢谢。我的黄金时代是在广州度过的，我的部队我的剧团我的老战友老邻居都在广州，我是广州的‘客家人’！”
    老人收伞，走进华灯放彩的新建宾馆的大门。他没进那幢铺有红地毯的新楼，而是踏入一座不久要拆除的老式危楼。他没能搬进离休点，家仍在这楼底的两间房，一间是自己用木板搭的。厨房在过道，厕所公用。昔年的幼儿园老师——退休的老伴迎上来，接过雨伞，第一句话：“还胸闷吗？”他微笑，摇摇头。
  “走！去医院！”老人笑声朗朗：“在朝鲜一把炒面一把雪，有一个星期浑身不舒服，还不是过来了！我很好，没事儿。”他抽起一支香烟，悠闲地品着。旧沙发旁边的苏联造电冰箱像用俄语说：“老同志，你再开一门课。”“对。要开这门课：俄语。因为区政协、老干局有好些同志要学。”老人年轻时曾向“白俄”学音乐，懂俄语。
      “爷爷好！”莺歌燕舞般来了五个男孩女孩。雨湿的红领巾使老人感到年轻活泼，恍若在朝鲜整个冬天没有洗澡，忽然春暖花开，跳进清亮亮的小河游泳，和战友们泼水作耍一样。他请老伴给孩子们一人一杯桔子汁，然后拿出《儿童日语课本》。先用广东话讲课，甚至能说一些俗语，如
  “湿湿碎”（小意思）之类；然后再用普通话讲；最后是领着孩子们合唱日本著名诗人阿部武雄的《秋词》……
    老人把孩子们送出家门，送出霓虹灯耀眼的宾馆大院。
  “李爷爷，别送了，回去吧！”“送你们等于散步啊！”他手牵着两个孩子，走出小巷，一直送到公共汽车站。孩子们上了公共汽车，老人还站在街边公园门前，望着孩子们，不住扬手。雨又下起来了，老人在雨中伫立，目送汽车拐弯消失……
      “自己的青春，自己珍惜，别人不得说；过去的欢欣，将来的残落，现在可宝贵得多。”老人在心里唱着《秋词》，踏着秋雨的街路向家走去。是的，“现在可宝贵得多”！在一部著名的描写海外赤子的得奖影片里，他扮演了艺术指导（他本人曾任部队歌剧团的艺术指导），还在几部影片里扮演了多种人物；他在区政协、老干局、业余大学等好几个单位授课。“我还有多少宝贵的事情要做啊！”雨丝，使不夜的天空像一张大的五线谱纸。他想：写！赶紧谱写我毕生构思的交响曲，《宝贵与残落》……
