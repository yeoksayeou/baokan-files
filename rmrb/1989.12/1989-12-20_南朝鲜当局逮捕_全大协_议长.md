South Korean authorities arrested the chairman of the "National University Student Representative Council," Lim Dong-sik, on December 18 in Seoul. The reason for his arrest is that he had sent a representative to Pyongyang to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival, which was deemed a violation of the _National Security Law_.

Since February of this year, Lim Dong-sik has been wanted by the police. In June, Lim Dong-sik presided over a meeting of the "National University Student Representative Council," deciding to send Lim Su-gyeong as the organization's representative to the 13th World Youth Festival held in Pyongyang in July. The police used this as grounds to accuse Lim Dong-sik of violating the _National Security Law_ and dispatched a large number of police to pursue him.

On December 18 at noon, Lim Dong-sik was discovered and apprehended by the police while being interviewed by a reporter from the South Korean Broadcasting System at Kyung Hee University in Seoul. According to South Korea's current laws, Lim Dong-sik will also face trial.
