People's Daily, Nangchang, November 30th. Reporter Zhao Xiangru reports: Jiangxi Province is seizing the opportunity presented by the rectification and adjustment period to create a strong atmosphere of "focusing on agriculture, discussing agriculture, supporting agriculture, and promoting agriculture" throughout the province. This effort aims to push the rural economy into a new stage of development.

The recent Ninth Plenary Session of the Eighth Provincial Party Committee decided:

To further strengthen the leadership of agriculture. The ability to increase the production of grain, cotton, and other major agricultural products, and to truly enhance the momentum of agriculture, will be important criteria for evaluating the performance of local, municipal, and county leadership.

To increase agricultural investment from multiple sources. Government investments at all levels will primarily be used for agricultural water conservancy projects and the development of supporting industries such as fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery. It is crucial to guide farmers to increase their labor accumulation and to educate them to invest more funds and labor into agricultural development. Starting now, each rural labor force will be arranged by the township and village to contribute 30 days of mandatory labor annually for agricultural water conservancy, forestry, and road construction, with at least 20 days dedicated to agricultural water conservancy.

To promote a batch of advanced and practical agricultural science and technology achievements. Currently, the per-unit yield of agriculture in the province is relatively low, and there is significant potential to develop agricultural production through technological progress. Efforts will be made to mobilize and organize agricultural science and technology personnel to go to the countryside and promote the cultivation of superior varieties and techniques for grain, cotton, oil, and sugar, as well as scientific techniques for fertilization, pesticide use, and breeding.

Township and village enterprises have become an important pillar of the rural economy in the province and a significant component of the national economy. Overall, these enterprises rely on local resources and are based on the processing of agricultural and sideline products and mineral products. Efforts will continue to develop these enterprises, using their development as a driving force to transform agricultural and sideline products from low to high efficiency. Enterprises that are inefficient and severely waste resources or pollute the environment will be adjusted, rectified, transformed, and improved in a planned and step-by-step manner.

To further promote the development of state farms, enhancing their radiative effect on surrounding rural areas. The integrated development of agriculture, industry, construction, transportation, and commerce will continue, with a focus on developing commercial bases for agricultural and sideline products.

    江西全力抓农村经济
    本报南昌电　记者赵相如报道：江西省抓住治理整顿的机遇，进一步在全省上下造成一种“思农、议农、支农、促农”的浓厚气氛和实际行动，不失时机地将农村经济推向新的发展阶段。
    最近召开的江西省委八届九次全体会议决定：
    进一步加强对农业的领导。把粮棉和其它主要农产品能否搞上去，农业是否真正增强了后劲，作为考核地、市、县班子政绩的重要标准。
    多方面增加农业投入。各级政府的投入，主要用于进行农田水利建设，发展化肥、农药、农机等支农工业。要十分重视引导农民扩大劳动积累，教育农民把资金和劳力更多地投到发展农业上去。从现在起，每个农村劳动力由乡、村统一安排，用于农田水利、林业、道路建设的义务工每年要达到30个，其中用于农田水利建设的不少于20个。
    抓紧推广一批先进适用的农业科技成果。目前全省农业单产水平较低，依靠科技进步发展农业生产的潜力很大。动员和组织农业科技人员下乡，抓紧推广粮、棉、油、蔗等优良品种和栽培技术、施肥用药技术、饲养技术及其它科学技术。
    乡镇企业已经成为全省农村经济的重要支柱和国民经济的重要组成部分。从总体上看，乡镇企业大都是依托本地资源，立足于农副产品和矿产品加工的，这需要继续努力发展，以发展乡镇企业为动力，促进农副产品由低效益向高效益转换。对少数效益差、严重浪费资源和污染环境的，将有计划有步骤地调整、整顿、改造和提高。
    进一步促进农垦企业的发展，使之对周围农村产生更大的辐射作用。要继续实行农、工、建、运、商综合发展，产供销配套成龙。背靠资源，面向市场，发展农副产品商品基地。
