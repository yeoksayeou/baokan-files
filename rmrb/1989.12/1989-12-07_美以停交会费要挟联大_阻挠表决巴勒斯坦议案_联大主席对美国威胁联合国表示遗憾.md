The United Nations General Assembly President Joseph Garba today issued a statement expressing regret over the United States' threat to withhold dues from the United Nations.

Garba said that the United States recently demanded that the UNGA not vote on a resolution affirming the statehood of Palestine, otherwise, the U.S. would stop paying its dues to the United Nations. This threat has caused some difficulties for the UNGA.

Garba pointed out that the United States' payment of dues to the United Nations should have nothing to do with the matters discussed in the UNGA. The U.S. paying dues is a duty stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and it is a debt owed by the United States to the United Nations, not a loan or a donation. Garba believes that the issue of affirming the statehood of Palestine needs more time to resolve, so he suggested that the UNGA postpone discussing this resolution and urged the Arab co-sponsoring countries not to insist on voting on this resolution.

Arab sources told reporters that the representatives of the 16 Arab countries that jointly proposed this resolution draft will discuss Garba's appeal tomorrow morning. To accommodate various opinions, they may agree to the UNGA's indefinite postponement of the review of this resolution.

The previous UNGA had passed a resolution to replace the Palestine Liberation Organization with "Palestine" as an observer to the United Nations, but it was unclear whether it was a state. Therefore, the 16 Arab countries drafted this resolution for the current UNGA, "deciding to interpret Palestine as the State of Palestine within the United Nations," continuing to enjoy observer status, that is, from an organizational observer to a "non-member state observer." Many member states of the United Nations have already recognized the State of Palestine and will support this resolution. However, the United States strongly opposes it and has taken threatening measures.

The U.S. dues account for 1/4 of the United Nations' budget. Since 1986, the United States has used the tactic of underpaying dues to pressure the United Nations, accumulating a total of about $500 million in arrears.

    美以停交会费要挟联大  阻挠表决巴勒斯坦议案
    联大主席对美国威胁联合国表示遗憾
    本报联合国12月5日电  记者刘开宸报道：本届联合国大会主席约瑟夫·加尔巴今天发表声明，对美国以停交会费威胁联合国表示遗憾。
    加尔巴说，美国最近要求联大不要表决肯定巴勒斯坦国地位的一项决议案，否则美国将停止向联合国交纳会费，这一威胁给联大造成一定困难。
    加尔巴指出，美国向联合国缴纳会费决不能与联大发生的事有任何联系；美国交纳会费是根据《联合国宪章》应尽的义务，是美国欠联合国的债款，并不是给联合国的贷款或施舍。加尔巴认为，关于肯定巴勒斯坦国地位决议案的问题需要更多的时间来解决，因此他建议联大推迟讨论此决议案，并呼吁阿拉伯共同提案国不要坚持表决该决议案的要求。
    阿拉伯人士告记者，共同提出此项决议草案的16个阿拉伯国家的代表将于明天上午就加尔巴的呼吁进行讨论，为照顾各方意见，很可能同意联大无限期推迟对此决议案的审议。
    上届联大曾通过决议，以“巴勒斯坦”代替巴勒斯坦解放组织作为联合国的观察员，但是否是国家不明确，所以16个阿拉伯国家为本届联大草拟这项决议草案，“决定在联合国内将巴勒斯坦作为巴勒斯坦国解释”，仍在联合国内享受观察员权利，即从一个组织观察员，成为“非成员国观察员”。联合国的许多成员国已承认巴勒斯坦国，将支持此决议案，美国却强烈反对，故采取威胁手段。
    美国会费占联合国经费的1／4。从1986年起，美国就以少交会费的办法向联合国施加压力，共拖欠约5亿美元。
