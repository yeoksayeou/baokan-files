The People's Music Publishing House recently published "201 Famous Chinese Songs" (solo songs). This is a representative collection of solo songs published over many years. "201 Famous Chinese Songs" is not just the voices in the concert hall; it presents the souls of composers and serious artistic creation, a serious artistic choice. The effect of this choice is artistic, but also ideological and cultural.

The song collection includes many excellent solo song works from the 1920s to the present, spanning nearly 70 years. After the May Fourth Movement, Chinese composers had a new musical artistic creation. The works included in this collection are a historical display of the development of Chinese music over the past 70 years, showing the path of Chinese music development—a path that connects with national traditions and the people.

The editors of "201 Famous Chinese Songs" have paid attention to various aspects of solo song creation over the past 70 years. For example, when selecting works, they have paid attention to composers with different artistic characteristics. In addition to well-known composers such as Xiao Youmei, Zhao Yuanren, Huang Zi, Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, Zhang Shu, Ren Guang, Lü Ji, He Lvting, Ma Ke, and Zheng Lucheng, the collection also includes newer generations of composers who emerged after liberation, including Shi Guangnan and Zheng Qiufeng. Songs that have almost been forgotten, such as Li Jinhui's "Moonlit Night" and Chen Xiaokong's "Xiang Lei," are also included. The styles of the works are diverse, including Xiao Youmei's "Question," Zhao Yuanren's "Selling Clothes," Huang Zi's "Three Wishes of the Rose," Nie Er's "Song of the Girl Under Iron Hooves" and "Song of the Great Road," Xian Xinghai's "Ode to the Yellow River," Lü Ji's "New Version of the September 18th Tune," He Lvting's "On the Jialing River," and various works by Li Jiefu and Zhu Jian'er since the founding of the nation. Additionally, the collection includes selections from operas such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Red Guards on the Plain," "Liu Huilan," and "Jiang Jie," as well as insert songs from television shows and movies such as "Four Generations Under One Roof" and "Red Sun."

The song collection pays attention to the combination of the ideological and artistic qualities of the selected songs with their popularity among the masses. The proposal to "combine" them is because they might be separated. Zhu Jian'er's "Sing a Mountain Song for the Party to Hear" has a clear ideological and artistic quality and also has broad popularity among the masses. Many modern young people are not very familiar with Nie Er's "Girl in the Borderlands" and Huang Zi's "Song of Filial Piety," which were widely circulated in the 1930s and 1940s. Qing Zhu's "I Live at the Head of the Yangtze River" has a musical tone and emotional depth that commercial so-called love songs cannot match. If one were to demand more from the editors of the song collection, it would be that a few songs that should have been included were not, such as Xian Xinghai's "Midnight Song" and Huang Zi's "Nanxiangzi," while some songs with strong "popularity" but lacking in artistic and ideological qualities were included.

    曲高和众
    ——评介《中国名歌201首》
    李业道
    人民音乐出版社最近出版了《中国名歌201首》（独唱歌曲）。这是多年来出版的一部有代表性的独唱歌曲集。《中国名歌201首》不只是音乐厅中的歌声，所呈现的是作曲家的心灵和严肃的艺术创造，是一种严肃的艺术选择，这种选择的效应既是艺术的，也是思想的、文化的。
    歌曲集选入了20年代以来近70年的许多优秀的独唱歌曲作品。五四运动以后，中国作曲家有了崭新的音乐艺术创造。这本歌曲集所收入的作品正是70年来中国音乐发展的一种历史展现，显示了中国音乐发展的道路——一条联系民族传统、联系人民的道路。
    《中国名歌201首》的编辑的视野注意到了70年来独唱歌曲创作的各个方面。如在编选作品时，就注意到了有不同艺术特点的作曲家，除了大家所熟悉的萧友梅、赵元任、黄自、聂耳、冼星海、张曙、任光、吕骥、贺绿汀、马可、郑律成等老一辈作曲家外；还有解放后包括近十年涌现的施光南、郑秋枫等新一代作曲家。几乎已经被人遗忘的黎锦晖的《月明之夜》、陈啸空的《湘累》也收入了集子。作品的风格是多样的，选入了萧友梅的《问》、赵元任的《卖布谣》、黄自的《玫瑰三愿》、聂耳的《铁蹄下的歌女》、《大路歌》、冼星海的《黄河颂》、吕骥的《新编九一八小调》、贺绿汀的《嘉陵江上》以及建国以来李劫夫、朱践耳等的各种不同题材的作品。此外，集子还编入了《白毛女》、《洪湖赤卫队》、《刘胡兰》、《江姐》等歌剧的选曲和《四世同堂》、《红日》等电视剧、电影的插曲。
    歌集的编选注意了所选歌曲的思想性、艺术性同群众性的结合。提出“结合”，就因为它们可能分离。朱践耳的《唱支山歌给党听》有鲜明的思想性和艺术性，也有广泛的群众性。现代许多青年已经不太熟悉的聂耳的《塞外村女》、黄自的《天伦歌》，在30年代、40年代曾经广泛流传。青主的《我住长江头》，其音乐格调及表现感情的深度是商品化的所谓爱情歌曲所不能比拟的。如果要向歌集的编选者提出更高的要求的话，那就是，有少数似应选入的没有选入，如冼星海的《夜半歌声》、黄自的《南乡子》，而个别“通俗性”强，缺乏艺术性、思想性的歌曲却入选了。
