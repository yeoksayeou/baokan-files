Regarding the Awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama and the Participation of Norwegian Leaders in the Award Ceremony

A senior official from the Department of West European Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Norwegian Ambassador to China, Holvik, today. The official lodged a strong protest with the Norwegian government over the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision on December 10th to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, as well as the participation of Norwegian leaders in the award ceremony.

The official stated that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the Tibet issue is purely an internal affair of China. No foreign government, organization, or individual has the right to interfere. The Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the Dalai Lama the prize has obvious political motives and is a provocation to the Chinese people. The participation of Norwegian leaders in the award ceremony and their meeting with the Dalai Lama is a blatant support for the Dalai Lama's activities aimed at splitting the motherland and a gross interference in China's internal affairs. He said, "I am instructed to lodge a strong protest with the Norwegian government over this."

The official added that the aforementioned actions by the Norwegian government completely contradict its claimed stance of recognizing Tibet as part of Chinese territory and violate the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs in international relations. This will seriously harm the already affected relations between China and Norway.

The official pointed out that the current difficulties in Sino-Norwegian relations are entirely due to the actions of the Norwegian side, for which the Norwegian government bears an inescapable responsibility. He hoped that the Norwegian government, with the long-term interests of Sino-Norwegian relations in mind, would change its current erroneous stance and return to the correct position.

    就授予达赖和平奖及挪威领导人参与授奖活动事
    外交部官员奉命向挪威政府提抗议
    新华社北京12月11日电  外交部西欧司负责人今天约见挪威驻华大使霍尔维克，就挪威诺贝尔委员会12月10日授予达赖喇嘛诺贝尔和平奖以及挪威领导人参与授奖活动事，向挪威提出严正交涉。
    西欧司负责人指出，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏问题纯属中国内政，任何外国政府、组织或个人都无权干涉。挪威诺贝尔委员会授奖达赖喇嘛有着明显的政治目的，是对中国人民的挑衅。挪威领导人竟然参加授奖仪式，并会见达赖，这是对达赖集团分裂祖国活动的公然支持，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。他说，“对此，我奉命向挪威政府提出抗议。”
    西欧司负责人说，挪威政府的上述举动，完全违背了它所宣称的承认西藏是中国领土一部分的立场，也背离了互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政的国际关系准则。这将给已经受到影响的中挪两国关系带来严重损害。
    西欧司负责人指出，中挪关系目前的困难局面完全是由于挪威方面的原因造成的，挪威政府对此负有不可推卸的责任。希望挪威政府以中挪关系长远利益为重，改变目前的错误态度，回到正确的立场上来。
