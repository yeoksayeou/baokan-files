	Poem One
	In the spring of 1985, I visited the former residence of General Zhang Xueliang and had a discussion in the former room of Miss Zhao Meiyu.
	The tale of Zhao Meiyu's room is passed down through the ages, with fame and infamy intertwined.
	Even after facing death a thousand times, the green mountains remain, yet one can only sigh at the hero's white hair.

	Poem Two
	In the spring of 1989, at the request of a friend, I annotated General Zhang Xueliang's handwritten poem "Without a Title" by Li Shangyin, written in September of the year of the rat in Taiwan, and this was composed spontaneously.
	Without a title, yet writing "Without a Title," it is as if one hears the cry of the emperor in the empty mountains.
	Though the poetic heart is hidden, the emotions cannot be concealed; the longing for the homeland is entrusted to Wang Xi.
	*Li Shangyin, styled Yishan, with the pseudonym Yuxi Sheng.

	Poem Three
	In the spring of 1989, I saw a recent photograph of General Zhang Xueliang and Mrs. Zhao Xiyu (Meiyu) published in a Hong Kong newspaper.
	Casually discussing romance and the rise and fall of dynasties, recalling past events stirs deep emotions.
	In life, it is rare to find a heroic partner; even the soil beneath her feet is fragrant.

    诗三首
    徐放
    其一
    一九八五年春，访张学良将军故居，座谈于昔日之赵媞小姐楼。
    佳话人传赵媞楼，千秋功罪自风流。
    万死留得青山在，漫叹英雄已白头。
    其二
    一九八九年春，受友人之托，注释张学良将军庚辰九月于台南所书唐李商隐《无题》诗之“来是空言去绝踪”后，偶成。
    无题不作写《无题》，如听空山望帝啼。
    诗心虽隐情难隐，故国乡思托王谿。＊
    ＊李商隐，字义山，号玉谿生。
    其三
    一九八九年春，得瞻张学良将军与赵绮霞（媞）女士之近照发表于香港报端。
    漫谈风月话兴亡，往事追维久激昂。
    人生难得英雄侣，玉足停留土亦香。
