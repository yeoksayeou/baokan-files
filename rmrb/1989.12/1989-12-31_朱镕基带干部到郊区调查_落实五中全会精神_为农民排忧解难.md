Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 28th - (Correspondent Shī Zhīhóng, Reporter Luó Kāngxióng) The Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor, Zhu Rongji, recently led more than 30 officials to suburban rural areas for a one-month investigation. The purpose was to study how to implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and to help farmers resolve their difficulties, aiming to elevate Shanghai's rural economy to a new level during the rectification and rectification period.

Shanghai is China's largest industrial city. The Municipal Committee and Municipal Government have always attached great importance to agricultural production. They believe that the principle of "no agriculture, no stability" also applies to Shanghai. The work in suburban rural areas is related to the "vegetable basket" and "rice bag" of the entire city's population. By stabilizing suburban rural areas, a foundation can be laid for stabilizing the market and people's lives, and for stabilizing Shanghai.

On December 21st, Zhu Rongji arrived at his first investigation site, Jinshan County. At a meeting with all members of the investigation team, he explained the purpose, tasks, and requirements of this investigation. The goal is to formulate specific measures to strengthen party building and stabilize the development of suburban economies based on understanding the current situation of party work and rural economic development in Shanghai.

In recent days, Zhu Rongji braved the cold and visited townships, towns, villages, and production teams. He had extensive conversations with grassroots cadres, masses, and retired cadres. He also visited specialized households and farmers' families, and inspected vegetable and fruit bases, marketplaces, and township enterprises. During the investigation, he inquired in detail about the party style of leadership teams wherever he went. When he learned that some rural cadres had issues with building, allocating, and renovating houses, as well as delaying payments, he stressed that improving party style is key to doing all rural work well. He emphasized that for issues that the masses strongly reflect on, such as improper practices, they must be corrected quickly. Through strengthening education, improving the legal system, strictly managing the party, and focusing on party style, he aimed to promote clean governance and unite the people.

During the investigation and research process, Zhu Rongji repeatedly emphasized that the party and the state's various economic policies for rural areas remain unchanged. At the same time, he paid great attention to discussing with grassroots cadres and masses how to improve rural policies based on new situations and problems, guiding farmers to increase agricultural investment, and mobilizing their enthusiasm to develop the rural economy. Zhu Rongji also insisted on solving problems while investigating, promptly helping farmers resolve their difficulties. Grassroots cadres reported to him about the current difficulties in selling pigs, the shortage of year-end distribution funds, and the significant increase in overdue receivables for township enterprises, which severely dampened farmers' enthusiasm. He immediately invited relevant department heads from the municipality to Jinshan County to jointly study measures and methods to solve the problems.

Zhu Rongji made three agreements with the investigation team members: to deeply understand the real situation by visiting grassroots levels and letting cadres and masses speak the truth; to maintain honesty and simplicity in life, setting an example; and not to interfere with the normal work order of counties and townships, not affecting their concentration on current rural work.

    朱镕基带干部到郊区调查
    落实五中全会精神  为农民排忧解难
    新华社上海12月28日电　（通讯员施芝鸿、记者罗康雄）中共上海市委书记、市长朱镕基最近带领30多名机关干部，前往郊区农村，进行为期一个月的蹲点调查，研究如何把党的十三届五中全会精神落到实处，使上海农村经济在治理整顿中跃上一个新的台阶。
    上海是我国最大的工业城市，市委、市政府几任领导十分重视农业生产。他们认为“无农不稳”对上海也不例外，郊区农村工作关系到全市人民的“菜篮子”和“米袋子”，把郊区农村稳住了，就能为稳定市场和人民生活、稳定上海打下基础。
    12月21日，朱镕基来到他蹲点调查的第一站金山县。在调查组全体同志会议上，他阐明了这次调查的目的、任务和要求，要在摸清当前上海农村党的工作和农村经济发展现状的基础上，制定加强党的建设和稳定发展郊区经济的具体措施。
    连日来，朱镕基冒着严寒，深入到乡、镇、村、队，与基层干部、群众和离休干部广泛谈心，同时走访专业户、农民家庭，实地察看副食品基地、集市贸易市场和乡镇企业。在调查中，他看到一处，都要详细询问领导班子的党风状况。当他了解到少数农村干部在建房、分房、装修住房和拖欠公款等方面，存在以权谋私、侵占集体和群众利益的现象时，强调指出抓好党风是做好农村各项工作的关键，对群众反映强烈的不正之风，要迅速纠正，并通过加强教育，健全法制，从严治党，狠抓党风，来促进廉政，凝聚人心。
    朱镕基在调查研究过程中，反复强调党和国家对农村的各项经济政策不变，同时他又十分注意与基层干部、群众共同探讨如何根据新情况、新问题，完善农村各项政策，引导农民增加农业投入，调动他们大力发展农村经济的积极性。朱镕基还坚持边调查，边解决问题，及时为农民排忧解难。基层干部向他反映当前农村卖猪难、年终分配资金短缺、乡镇企业被拖欠的应收销货款大幅度上升，严重挫伤了农民积极性。他立即把市有关部门负责人请到金山县，一起研究解决问题的措施和办法。
    朱镕基在调查中与调查组的同志约法三章：深入基层，了解实情，让干部、群众说真话；在生活上保持廉洁、俭朴，以身作则；不干扰县、乡的正常工作秩序，不影响他们集中精力抓好当前农村各项工作。
