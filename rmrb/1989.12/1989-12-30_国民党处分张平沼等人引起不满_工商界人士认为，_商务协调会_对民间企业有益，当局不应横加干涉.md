According to reports from Taiwan newspapers, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee on the 27th approved a proposal from the Central Discipline Inspection Committee to impose a one-year suspension of party rights on Central Committee member and "Legislative Yuan" member Zhang Pingru. The decision cited that Zhang had "failed to report or notify the organization in advance, and unilaterally organized the Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Coordination Council with Communist Party members, violating party policy and seriously breaching party discipline."

Upon learning of the "disciplinary action," Zhang Pingru expressed great dissatisfaction. He stated that when organizing the "Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Arbitration Coordination Council" last August, he had verbally reported to the Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Xiao Changle and later submitted a detailed written report. He emphasized that throughout the planning and organizational process, no one had stopped him, and Chairman Xiao Changle had not said he was breaking the law. Moreover, the "Commerce Coordination Council" is absolutely beneficial to private enterprises. Now, instead of being rewarded, he is being punished. He questioned, "Does the Central Party Committee have any sense of right and wrong? The entire punishment decision is absurd." He indicated that he would request a review.

Taiwan's business community was shocked by this decision, pointing out that the authorities, who are unable to act openly, now have civilian organizations willing to take on the task. Even if they do not encourage it, they should not interfere. Moreover, the business community hopes for the existence of such a coordinating organization that serves the business community.

At the same time, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee also approved a proposal to impose a one-year suspension of party rights on "Legislative Yuan" member Lin Yushang, and a one-year and six-month suspension on Kuomintang Central Committee alternate members Feng Dingguo, Li Jiannan, and Huang Guizao for "statements during the Taiwan year-end elections that violated party policy." This decision sparked strong opposition from the "additional committee members" in the "Legislative Yuan."

    国民党处分张平沼等人引起不满
    工商界人士认为，“商务协调会”对民间企业有益，当局不应横加干涉
    新华社香港12月28日电　据台湾报纸报道，台湾国民党中常会27日通过中央考核纪律委员会提议，对中央委员、“立法委员”张平沼“予以停止党权一年之处分”，认为他“事先未报组织核准或向组织报备，擅自与中共人员筹组海峡两岸经贸商务协调会，有违党的政策，严重违反党纪”。
    张平沼知悉“党纪处分”时，感到十分不满。
    他表示，去年8月筹组“海峡两岸商务仲裁协调会”时，曾以口头向大陆工作会主委萧昌乐报告，回来后更将整个始末作成书面报告。他强调，整个酝酿、筹组过程，没有人阻止他，萧昌乐主委也没说他违法。况且“商务协调会”对民间企业绝对有益处，现在反而要处分。他责问：“中央党部还有是非吗？整个处分决定莫名其妙。”他表示将要求申复。台湾工商界人士对此感到惊愕，指出，当局不便出面做的事，如今有民间组织愿意代劳，即使不鼓励，也不应该横加干预。而且工商界希望有这么一个为工商界服务的协调组织存在。
    同时，国民党中常会通过的提议还对“立委”林钰祥，国民党中央候补委员冯定国、黎建南、黄贵造以“在台湾年底选举中言论违反党的政策”为由分别予以停止党权一年六个月和一年的处分。这项决定，在“立法院”引发“增额主委”们强烈的反弹。
