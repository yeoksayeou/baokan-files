Picasso's masterpiece "The Marriage of Pierette" was sold for 315 million francs yesterday. The buyer is the Japanese company Otani Polis. Including a 5% transaction fee, the total purchase price reached $51.4 million, making it the highest price ever paid for a Picasso work and the highest price ever recorded for an artwork in the Paris art market, second only to the $53.9 million paid for a Van Gogh painting in New York in May this year.

"The Marriage of Pierette" is a work by Picasso from his 24th year (1905) and is considered a masterpiece from his transitional period. For nearly half a century, the whereabouts of this painting were unknown until it resurfaced during a Picasso exhibition in Stockholm last year. The painting depicts a clown sending a kiss to a young woman who is marrying an old man. The painting is 115 cm high and 195 cm wide.

In the auction halls connected by satellite television in Paris and Tokyo, more than 1,400 people from the art and business worlds gathered. The auction began at 6:30 PM with an initial bid of 100 million francs. Bidders competed fiercely, driving the price higher and higher.

The Japanese company Otani Polis plans to display this painting in the cultural facilities that will soon be completed in Oita Prefecture.

    毕加索名画在巴黎拍卖3亿法郎
    据新华社巴黎12月1日电  毕加索的名画《皮埃莱特的婚礼》昨天以3.15亿法郎的高价被拍卖。买主是日本奥特波利斯公司。加上5％交易费，这笔买卖高达5140万美元，这是迄今毕加索作品的最高售价，也是巴黎艺术品市场售价的最高纪录，仅次于今年5月纽约拍卖凡高名画5390万美元的价格。
    《皮埃莱特的婚礼》是毕加索24岁时（1905年）的作品，被称为他艺术过渡时期的杰作。约有半个世纪，这幅画下落不明，直到去年斯德哥尔摩举办毕加索展时才重新问世。这幅画描写的是一个小丑向嫁给老人的少妇送飞吻的情景，画高115厘米、宽195厘米。
    在由卫星电视联结的巴黎、东京两个拍卖会场，聚集了1400多名美术界和实业界人士。拍卖从下午6时半开始。开始出价为1亿法郎，然后购买者相互竞争，致使价格不断提高。
    日本的奥特波利斯公司准备把这幅画陈列在不久将落成揭幕的大分县的文化设施中。
