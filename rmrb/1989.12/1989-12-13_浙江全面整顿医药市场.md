Zhejiang Province has begun a comprehensive rectification of the disorderly conditions and issues that have arisen in the pharmaceutical distribution process. In Zhejiang's pharmaceutical market, some units and individuals have disregarded national regulations and engaged in the blind operation of both Chinese and Western medicines. Some have even illegally operated state-controlled drugs, narcotics, and poisons, hoarding goods to disrupt the circulation order. Some lawless elements have also used various illegal business methods such as producing and selling fake and substandard drugs, passing off inferior goods as superior ones, and evading taxes to make huge profits.

The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to close some pharmaceutical markets where problems are severe and operations are chaotic.

    浙江全面整顿医药市场
    据新华社杭州12月12日电　（实习生陈从容）浙江省对医药流通过程中出现的混乱状况和问题已开始进行全面整顿。浙江省医药市场上，有些单位和个人无视国家法规，盲目经营中西药品；有些甚至违法经营国家统一管理的药材和麻醉品、毒品，并且囤积居奇，扰乱流通秩序；一些不法分子还采取制售假药劣药、以次充好、偷税漏税等种种非法经营手段牟取暴利。浙江省政府为此已决定，关闭一些问题严重、经营混乱的医药市场。
