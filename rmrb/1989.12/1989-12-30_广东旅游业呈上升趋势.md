Guangdong's tourism industry has shown an upward trend in the second half of the year.

According to a report from our reporter Liang Zhaoming in Guangzhou on December 28th, due to the impact of the disturbances that occurred in the spring and summer, Guangdong's tourism industry experienced a sharp decline, reaching its lowest point in June in terms of both tourist numbers and revenue.

To promote the industry externally, they actively worked to open up channels for tourists. They sent 290 people on 290 occasions overseas to explain and promote the situation to clients and invited 83 groups totaling 688 people to visit the province for on-site inspections. At the same time, they accelerated the rectification and management of companies, seriously carrying out the star-rating evaluation work for foreign-related hotels. It is estimated that this year, the province will receive more than 23 million inbound tourists, and tourism earnings will reach 4.9 billion US dollars.

    广东旅游业呈上升趋势
    本报广州12月28日电  记者梁兆明报道：广东省旅游业下半年呈上升趋势。
    今年由于春夏之交发生动乱的影响，广东旅游业一度急剧滑坡，6月份的游客和收入降至最低点。
    为了对外宣传，他们积极疏通客源渠道。先后派出290多人次到海外，向客户做解释宣传工作，并请了83批688人次到省内国内实地考察。同时，他们还加紧清理整顿公司，认真搞好涉外饭店的星级评定工作。预计，今年全省入境游客将超过2300万人次，旅游创汇可达4.9亿美元。
