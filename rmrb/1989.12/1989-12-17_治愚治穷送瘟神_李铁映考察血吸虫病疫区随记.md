Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 17th

In the early winter of Jiangnan, rain and snow are scarce, and the weather is slightly cold. The vast expanse of the lake shore of Poyang Lake is covered with sparse reeds and grass. However, if you part the grass, it is not difficult to find the snails that carry blood fluke eggs.

On the morning of December 14th, Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a State Councilor, stepped onto the land of the blood fluke epidemic area in Xinjian County, Jiangxi Province. He immediately squatted down to observe how local blood fluke prevention workers test for snails.

He asked, "How many times a year do you check?"

The testing personnel introduced, "Once in the spring and once in the autumn. From this, one can understand the breeding patterns of blood flukes and then take measures to eradicate them on a large scale."

"What are the effective treatments for blood fluke disease?"

"Chemotherapy is the main treatment."

"What is the effect?"

"About half of the cases can be cured, but since there are still blood flukes in the water and by the lake, re-infection can occur."

Nanji Town's Wanjiatou Village is located on a small island in Poyang Lake. In the autumn and winter, it can be connected to the shore. The entire village of 65 households relies on fishing for a living, and most people have been infected with blood fluke disease. Li Tieying visited Wan Fada and four other late-stage blood fluke patients and gave them a package of gifts containing milk powder, royal jelly, and oranges. Li Tieying hoped they would take good care of their health and told the villagers who gathered around, "I represent the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to visit the people in the epidemic area, to understand the living and production conditions of the people in the lake area. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have made a decision to control and prevent blood fluke disease. The Party's purpose is to serve the people wholeheartedly. This time we come to understand the situation and will work with the local government to take a series of measures to help you treat the disease. After a year, we will come back to check on the treatment!"

Accompanied by thunderous applause, villager Wan Shaogui shouted, "We are deeply grateful. Only the Communist Party can do this."

As he left Wanjiatou Village, Li Tieying told the local officials, "Can this village develop some handicrafts? We need to find a way of life for the elderly, the weak, and the disabled. Preventing and eradicating blood flukes must be combined with poverty alleviation. We cannot simply view the prevention and eradication of blood flukes as a matter for the medical and health departments. For the comrades in the 12 provinces and cities with blood fluke epidemic areas, overcoming the disease, developing production, and improving the ecological environment are long-term struggles against the plague, and we must not be complacent."

Li Tieying also visited a junior high school. He went to the classroom of Grade 1, Class 1, and asked some male students how blood fluke disease is contracted. The response: "Swimming in the lake in the summer." He then asked the female students, who said they often wash clothes in the ditches. He immediately suggested that all primary school teachers in the epidemic areas should start teaching students about the dangers and prevention of blood flukes from the first grade, popularizing knowledge about the prevention, control, and eradication of blood flukes. Students who understand can become propagandists and can help in searching for snails and spreading medicine to kill them.

Li Tieying repeatedly emphasized to the local officials, "To drive away the plague, we must combine the eradication of blood flukes with the eradication of ignorance and poverty, and none of these can be missing. I hope that the county and township comrades will create some effective experiences in preventing and controlling blood fluke disease for promotion."

He said, "Developing production, increasing income, improving living habits, and sanitation conditions are a powerful guarantee for eradicating blood flukes."

    治愚治穷送瘟神
    ——李铁映考察血吸虫病疫区随记
    本报记者　赵相如
    初冬的江南，雨雪稀少，天气微寒。鄱阳湖畔茫茫一片的湖滩上，只有稀疏的芦苇和草丛。可是，只要拨开草丛，就不难找到寄生血吸虫卵的钉螺。
    12月14日上午，中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映一踏上江西省新建县血吸虫疫区的土地，就蹲下观看当地血防人员如何检测钉螺。
    他问：“一年查几次？”
    检测人员介绍：“春秋各一次。从中可以看出血吸虫繁殖的规律，进而采取大面积杀灭的办法。”
    “得了血吸虫病有什么有效疗法？”
    “以化疗为主。”
    “效果怎么样？”
    “可以治愈一大半，但由于水面、湖畔仍有血吸虫，所以还会重复感染。”
    南矶乡万家头村，坐落在鄱阳湖的一个小岛上。秋冬季节，能与岸上相连。全村65户以渔业为生，多数人感染过血吸虫病。李铁映看望了万发达等4位血吸虫晚期患者，并把装有奶粉、蜂皇浆和桔子的一包慰问品送给他们。李铁映希望他们好好养病，并对围拢过来的村民说：“我代表党中央、国务院来看望疫区人民群众，了解湖区人民生活、生产状况。党中央、国务院下了决心，一定要控制和防治血吸虫病。我们党的宗旨就是全心全意为人民服务。这次我们来了解情况，要和当地政府采取一系列办法帮你们治病。一年以后，我们还要来检查治疗得怎么样！”
    随着一阵雷鸣般的掌声，村民万绍桂扯起嗓子大声说：“我们感激不尽，只有共产党才会这样做。”
    走出万家头村时，李铁映对当地干部说：“这个村能不能搞点手工业？要为老弱病残找到生活出路。防治和消灭血吸虫，必须和治穷结合在一起，不能把防治和消灭血吸虫单纯看成是医药卫生部门的事。对于全国12个省市血吸虫病疫区的同志们来说，战胜疾病，发展生产，改善生态环境，长期与瘟神斗争，一点不能掉以轻心。”
    李铁映还走进了一所初级中学。他来到初一（1）班教室，问一些男同学血吸虫病是怎么得的？回答：夏天去湖里游泳。又问女同学，她们说常在河沟里洗衣服。他当即建议：所有疫区小学教师都要从一年级开始，就给小学生讲血吸虫的危害与防治，普及防治与控制、消灭血吸虫的知识。学生懂了，可以做宣传员，还可以帮助查钉螺、撒药灭螺。
    李铁映一再向当地干部强调说：“送瘟神，即治虫要同治愚和治穷结合在一起，缺一不可。希望县、乡同志创造出一些防治和控制血吸虫病的有效经验，以便推广。”
    他说：“发展生产，收入高了，生活习惯、卫生条件改善了，对于消灭血吸虫病是一个有力的保证。”
