A large map of the People's Republic of China and a large topographical map of the country occupy the two walls of the office. Water Resources Minister Yang Zhenhuai frequently points to the maps to introduce the recent situation of basic agricultural water conservancy construction and his outlook for 1990.

As of December 15, 1989, the country has invested 2.4 billion labor days in water conservancy, completed 3.2 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, increased, restored, and improved the irrigation area by 30 million mu, reduced the waterlogged area by 9 million mu, transformed 15 million mu of low-yield waterlogged and saline-alkali land, and treated approximately 80,000 square kilometers of soil erosion. These figures give a glimpse of the vast scale and good momentum of the mass campaign for agricultural water conservancy construction.

However, winter has already arrived in the north. Minister Yang said that during the cold winter, construction efficiency is low, and it is necessary to rest and prepare for water storage and irrigation in the winter and spring. When spring arrives, construction can be combined with pre-planting preparations to complete the construction of field engineering facilities, providing drought resistance for spring farming and agricultural harvest. In the south, Minister Yang said, a mass campaign for agricultural water conservancy construction is underway. Once the crops are harvested in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Hainan, and other places, the land will be freed up for subsequent construction. Minister Yang emphasized in his introduction of the situation that the emphasis in 1989 was on efficiency and quality in agricultural water conservancy construction. Small-scale projects should be prioritized, practical results should be sought, manpower should be cherished, and efforts should be made according to capacity.

Minister Yang said that the current water conservancy situation in China remains very severe. He pointed out several issues: Firstly, water conservancy facilities are aging and in disrepair, the entire industry is in deficit, and for ten consecutive years, it has been relying on old resources, making it impossible to maintain simple reproduction. Secondly, there is a water resource crisis in the north, including major cities like Beijing and Tianjin, and cities like Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and Yantai are also facing severe water shortages. Thirdly, soil erosion and water pollution treatment cannot keep up with human destruction, endangering the environment and ecology, and leaving problems for future generations. He said that in the new year, the Water Resources Ministry hopes that the 1.2 million water conservancy workers across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, will unite and strive to govern water with laws, overcome difficulties, and do practical things for the people.

In 1990, the Water Resources Ministry plans to focus on the following areas:

First, strengthen flood prevention and control work, maintain and improve the flood control capacity of rivers, ensure the safety of reservoirs, and guarantee the stability of industrial and agricultural production and society.

Minister Yang said that special attention should be paid to the safety of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and other seven major rivers and reservoirs to ensure that the "Four Modernizations" are not disrupted by sudden natural disasters.

At this point, Minister Yang pointed to the map and explained to the reporter in detail: China has 200,000 kilometers of dikes protecting the safety of more than 100 million square kilometers of plains. Here, 500 million people live, with 500 million mu of cultivated land, and densely populated large and medium-sized cities. During the flood season, they are often threatened. Once a major river or key reservoir has a problem, it will cause endless harm. Therefore, efforts must be made to strengthen this aspect of work.

Second, implement the Water Law and govern water with laws. He believes that the formulation and implementation of the Water Law is a historic event in China. In 1990, water conservancy bureaus (offices) at all levels should transform their functions and assume the responsibilities of water conservancy administrative management departments at all levels. Specifically, they should strengthen the unified management and protection of water affairs and water resources. Minister Yang believes that building a legal framework for water management is a long-term task. But it has not yet been recognized by the whole society, and he hopes that the media will do more in this regard.

Third, strengthen water conservancy management and fully utilize the benefits of existing facilities. He said that after 40 years of construction, water conservancy has accumulated fixed assets totaling 110 billion yuan, which is a considerable wealth and the result of the hard work of several generations. It must be managed and operated well. At the same time, comprehensive water conservancy management should be carried out, fully developing and utilizing the water surface and land within the management scope of reservoirs, dikes, and other water conservancy projects, and carrying out comprehensive management of water, agriculture, industry, commerce, and tourism.

At this point, Minister Yang recalled a calculation he had made with Minister He Kang of the Ministry of Agriculture: China currently has 700 million mu of irrigated land. If an additional 80 million mu is added, with each mu producing 500 kilograms, it would amount to 400 billion kilograms. In this way, adding other land that accounts for about 50% of the total cultivated land, the goal of producing 500 billion kilograms of grain by the year 2000 can be achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the quality of existing irrigated land and plan to expand the irrigation area. He said that Comrade He Kang has agreed to the principle of "agriculture following water," concentrating resources in areas with better water conservancy conditions, thus obtaining the bulk of the grain.

Fourth, strengthen river management and comprehensive development and utilization. First, planning should be done well, river basin management should be strengthened, and the construction and management of hydropower stations and rural power grids should be strengthened, focusing on flood control, irrigation, and water supply. Minister Yang especially proposed to strengthen the water conservancy construction in agricultural development zones and do a good job in the water conservancy projects in the Huang-Huai-Hai development zone, truly relying on "science and technology to invigorate water conservancy."

Fifth, push forward reform and opening up. The key is to change people's mindset. Strengthen theoretical and policy learning, strengthen ideological and political work, and strengthen clean governance and supervision and auditing work. On this basis, coordinate the relationships between various departments, regions, and aspects. Minister Yang said that water conservancy work has strong policy, scientific, mass, and social characteristics. He is an expert in civil engineering and believes that water conservancy projects are more difficult and complex than building railways or constructing large buildings.

    保持农田水利建设好势头
    ——访水利部部长杨振怀
    本报记者　何加正
    一张大幅的《中华人民共和国全图》和一张大幅全国地形图分左右占满了办公室的两壁。水利部杨振怀部长就是不时指点着地图向记者介绍近期农田水利基本建设情况和对1990年工作展望的。
    截至1989年12月15日，全国已投入水利劳动积累工24亿工日，完成土石方32亿立米，新增、恢复和改善灌溉面积3000万亩，除涝面积900万亩，改造渍害低产田盐碱地1500万亩，治理水土流失面积约8000平方公里。几个数字一摆，使人看到了群众性的兴修农田水利基本建设的广阔场面和好势头。
    但目前北方已进入寒冬。杨部长说，寒冬季节天寒地冻，施工效率不高，需要休整，搞好冬春储水和灌溉，等入春结合备耕完善田间工程的建筑物配套，防旱抗旱为春耕生产和农业丰收服务。而在南方，杨部长说，一个群众性的农田水利基本建设热潮正在开展。广东、广西、云南、海南等地一旦庄稼收割完毕，腾出地来，将要陆续进行。杨部长在向记者介绍形势时特别指出，1989年冬搞农田水利基本建设十分强调效益，强调质量。要以小型为主，讲求实效，珍惜民力，量力适度。
    杨部长说，我国目前水利形势仍然十分严峻。他向记者举了这样几点：首先水利设施老化失修严重，全行业亏损，连续十年“吃老本”，已经无法维持简单再生产。其次是北方包括京、津等大城市水资源危机，大连、秦皇岛、烟台等城市缺水也十分严重；再次是水土流失和水资源污染治理跟不上人为破坏，危及环境、生态，贻祸子孙。他说，在新的一年，水利部希望全国120万水利职工，在党中央、国务院领导下，团结奋进，齐心协力，以法治水，克服困难，为人民多办实事。
    1990年水利部打算着重抓好这样几方面的工作：
    第一项抓好防风抗洪工作，保持和提高江河防洪能力，确保水库的安全，以保证工农业生产和社会的稳定。
    杨部长说，特别要抓好长江黄河等七大江河和水库的安全，保证“四化”建设不被突发性的自然灾害所打乱。
    说到这里，杨部长指着地图向记者详细解释说：我国有20万公里长的堤防，保护着100多万平方公里平原的安全。这里居住着5亿人口，有5亿亩耕地，大中城市密布，工农业总产值占全国工农业总产值70％，一到汛期，多受威胁。大江大河或重点水库一旦出现问题，就危害无穷。因此，必须全力抓好这方面的工作。
    第二项，贯彻水法，以法治水。他认为水法的制定和实施，在我国是一项有历史意义的事情。1990年，各级水利厅（局）要转变职能，担负起各级行政水利管理部门的职责。具体来说就是要加强水政和水资源的统一管理和保护。杨部长认为，多干一个工程，少干一个工程不要紧。建立以法制水，是长期起作用的事情。但现在还没有为全社会所认识，他希望新闻界多做这方面宣传。
    第三项，加强水利管理，充分发挥现有设施效益。他说，经过40年建设，水利已积累固定资产总值1100亿元，这是一笔相当大的财富，是几代人艰苦奋斗的结果，一定要经营管理好。同时大搞水利综合经营，把水库、堤防等水利工程管护范围内的水面、地面充分开发利用起来，开展水、农、工、商、旅游等综合经营。
    说到这里，杨部长想起了曾和农业部何康部长算过的一笔帐：我国现有灌溉面积7亿亩，如再增加8000万亩，每亩按500来公斤产量计，就可达到4000亿公斤，如此，再加占耕地总面积50％左右的其他地，到2000年总产达到5000亿公斤粮食的目标就能实现。因此，目前必须抓好已有水浇地的质量，并有计划地抓好扩大灌溉面积的工作。他说，何康同志已同意“农随水转”，物资等集中投放水利条件较好的地方，这样就能得到粮食的大头。
    第四项，加强江河治理和综合开发利用。首先是搞好规划，加强流域管理，加强以防洪、灌溉、供水为主的水电站、农村水电网建设和管理加强城乡水资源的建设。杨部长特别提出，要加强农业开发区的水利建设，搞好黄淮海开发区的水利工程，真正依靠“科技兴水”。
    第五项，抓好改革开放。关键是人的思想观念要转变。加强理论学习、政策学习，加强思想政治工作和廉政建设和监察审计工作，在此基础上来协调各部门、各地区、各方面的关系。杨部长说，水利工作政策性、科学性、群众性、社会性很强。他是学土木工程的，他认为搞水利工程比修铁路、盖大楼更难，更复杂。
