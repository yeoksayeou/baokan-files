Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, December 5th.

On December 4, at the tenth NATO summit held here, U.S. President Bush briefed the leaders of the other 15 NATO member countries on the informal meeting between the U.S. and Soviet leaders. The NATO leaders believe that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact are "pillars of stability in Europe," reflecting the Western leaders' strategic intent to avoid rapid changes in the existing East-West structure.

The leaders emphasized the need for the West to coordinate its stance in the face of rapidly changing circumstances and to maintain the status quo of Europe's borders. The meeting also discussed issues related to East-West relations, arms reduction, and the future of Europe.

In addition, this summit showed a trend of policy adjustment among NATO member countries in the following three areas: 1. Adopting a more positive attitude towards Gorbachev's "reform" and "openness." 2. Formally responding to the "destiny of Germany." The meeting agreed that solving this issue must adhere to the following four principles: inviolability of existing borders; insistence on a "peaceful and gradual process"; consideration within the framework of NATO and the European Community; and through self-determination. 3. Emphasizing further strengthening of the internal construction of the European Community, which will promote the establishment of a "new European order."

Before attending the NATO summit, Bush, during his meeting with the President of the European Commission, Delors, confirmed that in the current European situation, a "strong" European Community is a "vital" partner for NATO.

    布什向北约首脑通报美苏首脑会晤情况
    北约首脑认为北约华约均是“稳定欧洲的支柱”
    本报布鲁塞尔12月5日电  记者魏崴报道：12月4日，在此间举行的第十次北约首脑会议上，美国总统布什向其他15个北约成员国的领导人通报了美苏首脑非正式会晤的情况。北约成员国首脑们认为，北约和华约均是“稳定欧洲的支柱”，反映出西方领导人不希望现有的东西方格局变化过快的战略意图。
    成员国首脑们强调西方要在急剧变化的形势下协调立场，维持欧洲的边界现状。会议还讨论了东西方关系、裁减军备和欧洲前途等问题。
    此外，本届首脑会议还在以下三个方面呈现出北约成员国首脑调整政策的趋向：1、对戈尔巴乔夫推行的“改革”和“开放”，采取更加积极的态度。2、就“德国的命运”正式作出反应。会议认为解决这个问题必须坚持以下四个原则：现有边界不可侵犯；坚持“和平的和渐进的过程”；在北约和欧共体范围内考虑；以及通过自决的途径。3、强调欧共体的内部建设进一步加强，将会促进“欧洲新秩序”的建立。
    布什在参加北约首脑会之前，同欧共体委员会主席德洛尔会谈时，曾确认在当前欧洲局势中，一个“强有力的”欧共体，是北约的“生死攸关”的伙伴。
