    Domestic Mini Cassette Recorders Exported
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th

    The Beijing Chaoyang Radio Factory has adopted internationally popular styles in the development of new products to meet the demands of the international market. In 1989, the factory exported 530,000 mini cassette recorders, accounting for 63% of the total production, earning the country $290,000 in foreign exchange.

    In the face of a sluggish domestic electronics market, the factory has focused on continuously improving product quality and design, developing new products, and promoting exports. Their products, shipped to countries such as the United States, the Netherlands, and Singapore, have all passed inspections by foreign customers.

    Recently, the factory has developed three new mini stereo cassette players tailored to the international market, which will be put into mass production next year.
