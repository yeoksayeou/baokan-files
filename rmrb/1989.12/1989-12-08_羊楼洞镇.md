Yangloudong Town, located at the junction of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces at the Songfeng Mountain Pass, is a crucial transit point for several provinces. Over the centuries, it has been quite prosperous and is known as the "Little Wuhan."

The Songfeng Mountain is shrouded in clouds and mist, with groves of bamboo and clusters of pine trees dotting the landscape, creating a lush green world. Yangloudong Town is abundant with springs, winding and connecting to form streams. The streets are adorned with flower beds, and tall buildings line both sides, presenting a bustling scene. The town is famous for its Songfeng Green Tea, which is renowned worldwide. It is also home to the Guanyin Mineral Water, the best of the 48 springs in Pucheng City. Additionally, the town produces high-quality osmanthus honey. With such excellent raw materials, the town's beverage factory produces honey tea soda, which is fragrant and sweet, making it a prized member of the soda family. Over the past decade, Yangloudong Town has established dozens of factories. Products such as tea leaves, bamboo shoots, bamboo crafts, and paper fans are not only sold throughout the country but are also exported to dozens of countries and regions around the world.

After passing a high-rise building, there is a small stone bridge with flowing water and visible pebbles. Crossing the bridge, one enters a typical southern water town, characterized by ancient buildings made of green bricks and gray tiles. It truly embodies the essence of "small bridges, flowing water, and houses." This is the old street of Yangloudong Town, which has been listed as a provincial-level cultural relic protection unit. The old street is narrow, with stone-paved roads that are smooth from years of wear. On both sides of the old street, shops and taverns are densely packed. Walking along, it seems to end, but upon turning, another street appears, giving a sense of endless discovery. Although some of the shops on the old street have been converted into residences and are now quieter, the past prosperity can still be faintly seen. Yangloudong Town was once a hub for tea processing and trading, particularly known for its brick tea. The largest brick tea factory in the country, Zhao Liqiao, was relocated from here after liberation. At that time, tea merchants from England, Russia, France, and Italy often came here to purchase tea. Therefore, on foreign-made maps of China, there is no Pucheng but there is Yangloudong Town, which shows the fame of Yangloudong Town.

    羊楼洞镇
    李郁秀
    湖北省蒲圻市羊楼洞镇，位于鄂、赣、湘交界的松峰山口，是几省往来的要冲，数百年来颇繁华，素有小武汉之称。
    松峰山头，云雾缭绕，时而一坡秀竹，时而一岗苍松，满目青翠，是个绿色世界。羊楼洞镇，泉水处处，蜿蜒相连，汇聚成溪；街道中间，花坛似锦，街道两旁，高楼林立，一派繁荣景象。这里有驰名中外的松峰绿茶，还有居蒲圻市48泉之首的观音矿泉水，更有可称上乘的桂花蜂蜜，原料如此之优，镇饮料厂生产的蜜茶汽水，清香甜润，是汽水家族中的珍品。十几年来，羊楼洞镇办起了几十家工厂，茶叶、竹笋、竹器、纸扇等品，不仅销往全国各地，而且畅销世界几十个国家和地区。
    走过一座高楼，有个小小石桥，溪水潺潺，卵石可见；过桥便是一个典型的江南小镇，全是青砖灰瓦的古朴建筑，真可谓小桥流水人家了。这是羊楼洞镇老街，已被列为省级文物保护单位。老街很窄，石板铺路，磨得溜光；老街两旁，店铺酒肆，鳞次栉比。走着走着，似到尽头，可一转身，又是一条街道，颇有层出不穷之感。现在老街的店铺有的虽已改为民宅，寂静多了，但往日的繁华仍依稀可见。羊楼洞镇过去是个茶叶加工和交易商埠，尤其盛产砖茶，现在全国最大的赵李桥砖茶厂就是解放后从这里迁去的。当时常有英、俄、法、意等国茶商来此购茶。所以，在外国人绘制的中国地图上，没有蒲圻而倒有羊楼洞镇，可见羊楼洞镇的名气了。
