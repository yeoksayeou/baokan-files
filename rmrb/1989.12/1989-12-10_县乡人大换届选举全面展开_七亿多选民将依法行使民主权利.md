The nationwide elections for county and township People's Congresses will be fully launched this winter and next spring. It is estimated that over 700 million voters will participate in this election.

The Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress invited reporters from some news agencies in Beijing to discuss the publicity work for the county and township People's Congress elections today.

Peng Qingyuan, Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, introduced the situation of this round of county and township elections. He said that according to the Constitution, the term of office for the People's Congresses at the county, county-level city, district, township, and town levels is three years. The People's Congresses at the county and township levels elected in the second half of 1986 and 1987 will have their terms expire between the second half of this year and the end of next year. Over 2,800 counties (cities, districts) and more than 60,000 townships and towns across the country will conduct elections in accordance with the law.

He said that except for those who have been deprived of political rights by law, all Chinese citizens who are 18 years old or above will exercise their democratic rights.

Peng Qingyuan pointed out that this round of county and township People's Congress elections is the fourth direct election of county and township People's Congress representatives since 1979. It is of great significance to do a good job in this round of elections. Especially at present, as the whole Party and the people of the whole country are deeply implementing the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the 13th Central Committee of the Party, doing a good job in the election work is of great importance to promoting the stability of the current political and economic situation, further improving the system of the People's Congress, strengthening democratic and legal construction, strengthening the construction of grassroots political power, and promoting the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization.

He hoped that the news agencies would do a good job in the publicity work for this round of county and township elections. Through the positive guidance of public opinion, the county and township elections will be conducted smoothly and healthily.

    县乡人大换届选举全面展开
    七亿多选民将依法行使民主权利
    新华社北京12月9日电  （记者胡清海）全国县乡换届选举工作在今冬明春将全面展开。据测算，全国将有7亿多选民参加这次选举。
    全国人大常委会办公厅今天邀请首都一些新闻单位的记者座谈县乡人大换届选举的宣传工作问题。
    全国人大常委会副秘书长彭清源介绍了这次县乡换届选举的情况。他说，宪法规定，我国的县，不设区的市、市辖区和乡、镇的人大每届任期3年。1986年下半年至1987年选举的县、乡两级人大的任期，将于今年下半年到明年年底先后届满。全国的2800多个县（市、市辖区）和6万多个乡、镇都要依法进行换届选举。
    他说，这次换届选举除依照法律被剥夺政治权利的人以外，凡年满18周岁的我国公民都要行使自己的民主权利。
    彭清源指出，这次县乡人大换届选举，是1979年以来，我国进行的第四次县乡人大代表的直接选举。搞好这次换届选举具有重大意义。特别是当前全党、全国人民深入贯彻党的十三届四中全会和五中全会精神，搞好选举工作对促进当前政治、经济形势的稳定，进一步健全人民代表大会制度，加强民主和法制建设，加强基层政权建设，推进社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设都有重要作用。
    他希望新闻单位做好这次县乡换届选举宣传工作。通过舆论的积极引导，使县乡换届选举工作顺利健康地进行。
