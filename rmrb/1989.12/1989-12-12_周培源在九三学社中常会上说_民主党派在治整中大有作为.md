“The Communist Party is the core of building a new China, and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party is a system that serves the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and is unparalleled by Western party politics.” These words were spoken by Zhou Peiyuan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, at today's Eighth Central Committee Fourth Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

He pointed out that with the leadership of the Communist Party, no difficulties can obstruct the Chinese people from advancing on the road of socialist modernization construction. The idea that democratic parties seem to have difficulty playing a role during the period of rectification and order is obviously wrong, as is the attitude of passive waiting and inaction. In terms of democratizing and scientizing the decision-making of major economic construction projects, consulting and researching local development strategies, as well as supporting frontier development, poverty alleviation, technological services, and intellectual development, various levels of organizations within the China Democratic National Construction Association can do a lot.

Zhou Peiyuan emphasized that as a democratic party that accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and works closely with it, the China Democratic National Construction Association should, through its work and influence, maintain a stable and united political situation, actively participate in political consultation and democratic supervision, and promote the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system. At the same time, it must also give full play to its advantage of concentrating scientific and technological talents, do a few effective things in the fields of scientific and technological agriculture and intellectual development, and make scientific and technological progress better promote economic development and social progress.

    周培源在九三学社中常会上说
    民主党派在治整中大有作为
    本报北京12月11日讯　“共产党是建设新中国的领导核心，共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，是符合我国人民根本利益的一种制度，是西方的政党政治所无法比拟的。”这番话是全国政协副主席、九三学社中央主席周培源在今天召开的九三学社八届四次中常委扩大会议上讲的。
    他指出，有中国共产党的领导，任何困难都不能阻挡我国人民在社会主义现代化建设的道路上前进。那种认为在治理整顿期间民主党派似乎难以发挥作用的想法和消极等待、无所作为的态度显然是不对的。在重大经济建设项目决策的民主化、科学化，地方发展战略的研究咨询，以及支边扶贫、科技服务、智力开发等方面，九三学社的各级组织都可以作很多事情。
    周培源强调说，作为接受共产党领导、与党亲密合作的一个民主党派，九三学社要通过工作和影响，维护安定团结的政治局面，积极参加政治协商和民主监督，促进社会主义民主和法制建设。同时还必须发挥科技人才比较集中的优势，在科技兴农和智力开发方面，做几件有成效的工作，使科学技术更好地促进经济发展和社会进步。　（葛海霞　袁建达）
