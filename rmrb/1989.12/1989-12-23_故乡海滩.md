My hometown, which gave birth to and nurtured me, is very close to the sea. It is difficult to express how deeply I feel for the sea. The vast expanse of the sea is like the milk that nourished me. No matter where I go, the sea is always in my heart.

My hometown stretches across the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, known historically as the "Liaonan Isthmus." From a high vantage point, the closest distance between the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea is only about three kilometers. This place has always been a strategic location for military conflicts. The clash of arms and the sinking of weapons have been smoothed over by the sea. Regardless of its turbulence or tranquility, the sea's depth and breadth are eternal. I remember the gentle waves of the Bohai Bay, as soft and tender as a maiden. The clear sea water mixed with fine sand, and the fishermen who play in the sea understand the sea's temperament. My hometown's beach, Jin Shi Tan, has a strong masculine character. Every rising wave is like an unyielding spine, and the rolling waves are like strong tendons, gathering a firm strength, using its masculine bones to collide with the mainland, carving the hard and majestic rocks on the shore, and shaping the vastness of the north...

Two years ago, in early autumn, I stayed at the home of an old fisherman, Ge Wu Ye, on Jin Shi Tan to experience life. Ge Wu Ye is already 75 years old. His body is like a rock standing in the waves. I have heard many stories about him. During the Japanese puppet regime, a haughty Japanese officer deliberately wanted to wrestle with the robust Ge Wu Ye. No matter how fiercely he threw Ge Wu Ye to the ground, the old man, who was not allowed to retaliate, would always get up from the beach. This went on until the Japanese officer was too exhausted to lift his arms. Sailing out to sea with such an old man, for some reason, I felt like I was standing on solid ground, with a sense of security. That day, the sea was churning with five-level waves. The small boat Ge Wu Ye was steering was only about a zhang long. He steadied the oar and sailed into the sea's embrace. The small boat was sometimes lifted onto the wave crest and sometimes thrown into the trough. When passing "Changjiang Liu," the old man said, "Remember! When I ask you if the boat is moving forward, you must say, 'Yes, it is moving forward!'" "Changjiang Liu" is the most treacherous current in the Jin Shi Tan waters, with countless breaking waves roaring and surging. I tightly gripped the raised dragon bone at the bow of the boat. Ge Wu Ye rowed the oar, and the small boat trembled violently in the current. As we passed the midpoint, he shouted loudly, "Is our boat moving forward?" I also shouted loudly in response, "Yes, it is moving forward!" He asked, and I answered, almost shouting until my voice was hoarse, using all my strength. In the shouting, I and the old man seemed to be invigorated, standing firm in our resolve. I seemed to understand many things.

The ebb and flow of the tides, on the Jin Shi Tan, which is already nine billion years old, I deeply felt the slow and profound pulsations of nature. The ocean of life, my source of creation. Over the past ten years, my works have almost all been written with sea water. Don't think that only scholars and poets can write poems and essays to praise Jin Shi Tan. At a symposium on Jin Shi Tan, I personally heard Professor Zheng Zhe from the Geology Department of Peking University read a paper that was like a poem. Jin Shi Tan is like a poem of life, a picture of life. Here, you can appreciate the nine to three billion-year evolution of the earth, which is the immortal track of life carved on the rocks. The deep red, majestic cliffs in the blue sea stand out, and they are the solidified blood. The red rocks are a true portrayal of the life-creating era, the Sinian Period. Life originated in the Sinian Period, and this era is the fast-paced stage in the evolution of the earth. Red—symbolizing the fast pace, the symbol of life, a picture drawn by the god of nature with blood. The painter Guang Ting Bo once climbed to these magnificent cliffs, stretched out his limbs, and imitated the original rock paintings with his flesh and blood to form a large human figure. As for me, I would rather melt into the deep blue waves...

    故乡海滩
    徐铎
    生我养我的故乡离海很近，难以诉说对海的感情多深。浩瀚的海水就是哺育我的乳汁。无论走到哪里，大海都在我心中。
    我的故乡横跨黄渤两海，属历史上著名的“辽南地峡”。站在高处望去，黄海与渤海的最近相距处不过三公里。这里自古便是兵家争战的咽喉之地。金戈铁马，折戟沉沙，大海抚平了历史。无论它的狂暴肆虐，无论它的静谧安然，它的深沉和广博是永恒的。曾记得渤海湾的微波细浪，像处子一样温柔娴静，清盈的海水溶着细沙，玩海的汉子深谙海的脾性。故乡的海滩金石滩极有男人的个性，每一道隆起的浪涌如同不屈的脊梁，滚动的浪头犹如强壮的肌腱，凝聚着铮铮力度，用那雄性的骨骼，撞击着大陆，雕凿着岸边坚硬伟岸的岩石，塑造了北方的旷远……
    前年的初秋，我住在金石滩老渔民葛五爷家里体验生活。葛五爷已是75岁高龄的老人。他的身子骨好似屹立在海浪中的岩石。我听到过许多关于他的故事。日伪统治时期，一个骄横的日本军官故意要同体魄强健的葛五爷摔跤。无论他怎样凶狠地将葛五爷摔倒，被规定不准还手的葛五爷都能从海滩上爬起来，直到日本军官累的抬不起胳膊。随这样的老人出海钓鱼，不知为什么，我心里好像踩着一块坚实的土地，有着一种安全感。那天，海面上涌荡着五级风浪。葛五爷驾驭的那条小船不过丈把长。他稳稳地掌着橹，驶入了大海的怀抱。小船一会儿被托上浪峰，一会儿又被抛进涛谷。船过“长江流”时，老人说：“记住！过一会儿，我问你‘船是不是向前走’时，你一定要说：‘是向前走！’”“长江流”是金石滩海域最险的一条急流，呼啸奔腾的急流上翻卷着无数道开花浪，我死死地攥着船头那根翘起的龙骨。葛五爷晃着膀子掌橹。小船在急流中剧烈地战栗。船过中流，他大声吆喝：
  “咱们的船向前走么？”我也大声回答：“向前走！”他问一声，我应一声，几乎喊破了嗓子，用尽了全身气力。我和五爷在喊声中好像振奋了精神，树起了信念，我似乎懂了许多。
    潮起潮落，在已有九亿年高龄的金石滩，我深深感受到了大自然那迂缓深沉的搏动。生命的海洋，我的创作源泉。十年来，我的作品几乎都是蘸着海水写成的。不要以为只有文人墨客会写诗作赋赞美金石滩。在金石滩的一次论证会上，我亲耳聆听了北京大学地质系教授郑辙宣读的一篇诗一样的论文。金石滩犹如一首生命的诗，一幅人生的图画。在这里，你可以领略到九至三亿年地球进化的年轮，那是生命铭刻于岩石上的不朽轨迹。碧海间那一处处深红色的雄浑峭岩分外生辉，它就是凝固的血液。红色的岩石是创造生命的纪元震旦纪的真实写照。生命起源于震旦纪，这个纪元是地球进化史上的快节奏阶段。红色——快节奏的标志，生命的象征，一幅自然之神用血液描绘的图画。画家广庭渤先生曾攀到这绚丽的峭岩上，舒展四肢，用血肉之躯模仿那原始的岩画上的造型做出一个大写的人字图型。而我，则多想溶化在那湛蓝湛蓝的海浪里去……
