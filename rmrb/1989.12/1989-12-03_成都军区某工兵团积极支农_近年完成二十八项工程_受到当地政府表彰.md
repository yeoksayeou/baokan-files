    A Certain Engineering Corps of the Chengdu Military Region Actively Supports Agriculture
    Completes 28 Projects in Recent Years, Receives Praise from Local Government

    The People's Daily reports: A certain engineering corps of the Chengdu Military Region stationed in Yunnan has actively contributed to the development of agricultural production. By the end of October, the corps has completed 28 support projects in recent years, significantly improving the agricultural production conditions in the local area, and has received praise from the local government.

    The area where the corps is stationed is mountainous with steep slopes, often lacking rain, and experiencing floods during the rainy season, which brings great difficulties to agricultural production. The "grain basket of central Yunnan" Yuxi Basin suffers from floods every year. A river running through tens of thousands of acres of fertile land has a narrow bend downstream, and when the mountain floods surge during the rainy season, they inundate a large area of fertile land along the banks. Early this year, the corps spent 40 days widening and dredging the river channel, ending the history of floods in this area. The project was valued at over 100,000 yuan, but the corps did not charge a single cent. Near the corps' station, the living conditions in Gaocang Township are difficult, and the production conditions are even worse. In April of this year, the township government raised over 100,000 yuan to build a reservoir, but everywhere they went, engineering teams refused to take on the job because the pay was too low. After learning of this situation, the corps leadership dispatched soldiers and some machinery to work for three months, helping the township build two reservoirs with a capacity of over 400,000 cubic meters. This not only solved the water supply problem but also irrigated over a thousand acres of paddy fields in three villages. The total cost of the project was 120,000 yuan, but the corps only charged 60,000 yuan for machinery maintenance and fuel.

    The corps also supported the construction of hydroelectric stations in impoverished mountainous areas and helped some remote counties and districts build six roads. Just this year, the corps' honor room has added 20 banners sent by local governments and the people.

    成都军区某工兵团积极支农
    近年完成二十八项工程　受到当地政府表彰
    本报讯　成都军区驻滇某工兵团积极为发展农业生产作贡献，截至10月底，近年已完成28项支农工程，大大改善了驻地的农业生产条件，受到当地政府的表彰。
    这个团所在地山高坡陡，平时缺雨水，雨季闹山洪，给农业生产带来很大不利。“滇中粮仓”玉溪坝子年年闹洪灾，横贯几十万亩良田的一条河，由于下游拐弯处河道窄，雨季山洪暴发，淹掉沿岸大片良田。今年初，该团用了40天时间，拓宽疏通河道，结束了这里闹洪灾的历史。这项工程计价10多万元，但团里分文未收。该团驻地附近的高仓乡生活用水困难，生产条件更差，今年4月，乡政府筹资10余万元修水库，到处请工程队，人家嫌钱少而不干。团领导得知这情况后，派出官兵，抽出一些机械，大干了3个月，帮这个乡修建了两个水库，蓄水40多万立方米，不仅解决了吃水问题，还能灌溉3个村寨的上千亩稻田。全部工程结算要12万元，部队只收了机械维修和油料费6万元。
    这个团还支援贫困山区修建水电站，帮助一些偏僻的县区修建了6条公路。仅今年一年，团里荣誉室里就增加了20面地方政府和人民群众送来的锦旗。             （蒋勇　刘德安　汪德华）
