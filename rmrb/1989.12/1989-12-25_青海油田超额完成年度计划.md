Qinghai Oilfield, which has seen crude oil production increase by 25 percent year-on-year for three consecutive years, had produced 704,000 tons of crude oil by December 10, completing the state's annual plan 20 days ahead of schedule.

In recent years, Qinghai Oilfield has led the nation in crude oil production growth. This year, despite numerous challenges, they organized construction teams and oil extraction plants to accelerate ground construction, increased temporary oil storage facilities, and ensured the smooth operation of 40 new wells. Simultaneously, they worked to clear transportation bottlenecks on roads and railways, coordinated loading, transportation, and unloading processes, and modified 300 oil tankers to transport crude oil. This effort ensured that more than 800 tankers, both within and outside the field, operated day and night on the 660-kilometer transportation line spanning Gansu and Qinghai provinces, transporting approximately 1,600 tons of crude oil per day.
