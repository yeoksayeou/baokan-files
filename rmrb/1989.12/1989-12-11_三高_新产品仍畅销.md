According to incomplete statistics from the State Planning Commission on 11 provinces and municipalities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shaanxi, 975 new products that were introduced for trial production and trial sales in 1988 achieved a total output value of 4.32 billion yuan and a profit of 680 million yuan from January to September this year. They also generated and saved 355 million US dollars in foreign exchange, with the amount of foreign exchange generated and saved already exceeding the three-year trial production target.
