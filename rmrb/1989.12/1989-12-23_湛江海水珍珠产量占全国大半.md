Seawater pearl farming has become a distinctive foreign exchange-earning agricultural industry in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province. According to statistics from relevant departments, the city's annual seawater pearl production accounts for two-thirds of the national total, with the majority being exported to earn foreign exchange. This year, the total output value of pearls, pearl processing, and comprehensive utilization in the city has exceeded 50 million yuan, doubling last year's figure.

Zhanjiang has a long coastline with many bays suitable for pearl farming. Currently, five counties and 26 townships in the city are utilizing this advantage to develop over 10,000 mu of tidal flats, cultivating more than 4.7 billion oysters of various sizes. The city produces nearly 2,000 kilograms of seawater pearls annually and has established several comprehensive enterprises for necklace processing and pearl shell powder processing. The rise of this foreign exchange-earning agriculture not only creates a large amount of foreign exchange for the country but also helps many formerly impoverished villages to escape poverty. Now, including comprehensive utilization income, the annual income exceeds 10 million yuan, with a per capita annual net income of over 2,300 yuan. Six hundred and thirty-five farming households have built new houses.

    湛江海水珍珠产量占全国大半
    本报讯　海水养殖珍珠已成为广东省湛江市富有特色的创汇农业。据有关部门统计，全市海水珍珠年产量占全国总产量的三分之二，大部分供出口创汇。今年以来，全市珍珠和珍珠加工、综合利用产值五千多万元，比去年增长一倍。
    湛江市海岸线长，适宜珍珠养殖的港湾多。目前全市已有五个县二十六个乡镇利用这个优势，开发一万多亩海滩，放养大小珠贝四点七亿多只，年产海水珍珠近二千公斤，还相应办起项链加工、珍珠贝壳粉末加工等一批综合企业。这一创汇农业的兴起，不仅为国家创造大量外汇，还使大批昔日的贫困村脱了贫。如今，包括综合利用的收入，一年超过一千万元，人均年纯收入二千三百多元，六百三十五户农家建了新楼房。
