Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 2nd. According to reports from Lebanese newspapers today, Lebanese President Hrawi stated that, at the request of some Arab countries and other nations, he has postponed the attack on the presidential palace occupied by Aoun.

Hrawi expressed his hope that Christian leader Aoun would peacefully withdraw from the presidential palace.

Aoun, who has been dismissed by Hrawi from his positions as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Head of the Provisional Military Government, has consistently refused to allow President Hrawi to enter the presidential palace located in the eastern part of Beirut.

Aoun, who commands 20,000 Christian troops, refuses to recognize Hrawi's legitimacy as president, rejects Hrawi's order to withdraw from the presidential palace, and vows to "resist Syria's occupation to the death."

Currently, Syria has 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 30th. The Arab mediation committee for the Lebanese crisis, consisting of three countries, has called on the opposing factions in Lebanon to exercise restraint, resolve issues through dialogue, and remove obstacles with wisdom and sincerity.

The committee, composed of the heads of state of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Algeria, issued a joint statement today from the capitals of the three countries.

The statement reaffirmed the committee's support for the new Lebanese government and pledged continued support for every action taken by the new government to maintain security and stability. The statement called on all parties to make unremitting efforts to strengthen Lebanese unity.

    新华社贝鲁特12月2日电  据黎巴嫩报纸今天报道，黎巴嫩总统赫拉维说，在一些阿拉伯国家和其他国家的要求下，他已推迟了向奥恩占据的总统府发动的进攻。
    赫拉维说，他希望基督教领导人奥恩能和平地撤离总统府。
    已被赫拉维解除了武装部队总司令和临时军政府领导人职务的奥恩，一直拒绝让赫拉维总统进入位于贝鲁特东区的总统府所在地。
    统率2万名基督教军队的奥恩拒绝承认赫拉维作为总统的合法性，拒绝执行赫拉维要他撤出总统府的命令，并表示要：“誓死反对叙利亚的占领。”
    叙利亚目前在黎巴嫩驻有3.5万军队。
