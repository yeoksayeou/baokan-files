Today at dawn, more than 300 soldiers led by Gregorio Honasan launched another military coup. They are members of the "Reform the Armed Forces Movement" and called for more soldiers to join their coup.

According to Philippine military sources, about 7,800 government troops have defected. Currently, the government's loyal troops have surrounded the two television stations, the 2nd and 4th channels, occupied by the coup leaders, and clashes have broken out. The headquarters of the Philippine Air Force in Villamor Base and the headquarters of the Philippine Army in Bonifacio Camp are still under the control of the coup leaders. They have also launched three attacks on the headquarters of the Philippine Armed Forces in Camp Aguinaldo and the headquarters of the Constabulary in Camp Crame. The residence of the Chief of Staff, De Villa, in Camp Crame was destroyed by an explosion. A group of coup soldiers have approached the presidential palace and controlled a nearby bridge. When the government's loyal troops arrived this afternoon, the fighting intensified.

After the coup, President Corazon Aquino immediately convened a cabinet meeting and, through the private television station Channel 9, announced that Defense Secretary Ramos, Chief of Staff De Villa, and the commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Constabulary all expressed their determination to stand with the government. She called on the people to support her government. Corazon Aquino said this afternoon at the presidential palace to reporters that the government troops have the ability to suppress the coup. She will not leave the presidential palace to move to another safe place.

Ramos also made a broadcast this afternoon, saying that the situation in Manila is "very dangerous," but most of the officers and soldiers in the military still support the government and hope that people will maintain confidence in the government. De Villa also said, "We are mobilizing troops to quell the rebellion by this evening."

According to local radio reports, about 3,000 to 4,000 government troops are advancing towards Manila from the north and south. It is estimated that they will arrive at their destination by this evening.

Meanwhile, at the request of President Corazon Aquino, U.S. President Bush ordered U.S. military forces stationed in the Philippines to dispatch aircraft to support the Philippine government troops. This afternoon, U.S. military aircraft were seen circling over Manila. There are reports that some coup soldiers have surrendered under the government troops' counterattack.

This is the sixth coup since Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986. The previous five coups were all thwarted by the government. The fifth coup in August 1987 was also led by Honasan.

    菲律宾发生军事政变
    科·阿基诺总统认为有能力粉碎政变
    军界首脑均表示坚决和政府站在一起
    新华社马尼拉12月1日电  今天凌晨，由格雷戈里奥·霍纳桑领导的300多名军人再次发动军事政变。他们都是“改革武装部队运动”成员，并呼吁更多军队参加他们的政变。
    据菲律宾军方人士透露，现约有7800名政府军倒戈。目前，忠于政府的军队已包围了被政变者占领的第2和第4频道两个电视台，双方发生火并。菲律宾空军司令部所在地比利亚莫尔基地和陆军司令部所在地博尼法西奥军营仍在政变者控制之下。他们还向菲律宾武装部队司令部阿吉纳尔多军营和保安军司令部克莱梅军营发起三次进攻。武装部队参谋长德贝利亚在克莱梅军营的住所被炸毁。一批政变军人已接近了总统府，并控制了附近的一座桥。当忠于政府的军队今天下午开抵时，双方战斗趋剧。
    政变发生后，科·阿基诺总统立即召开内阁会议，并通过私人电视台第9频道发表讲话说，国防部长拉莫斯、总参谋长德贝利亚以及陆海空三军司令和保安军司令都表示坚决和政府站在一起。她呼吁人民支持她的政府。科·阿基诺今天下午在总统府对记者说，政府军有能力粉碎政变。她决不离开总统府，转移到其他安全地方去。
    拉莫斯下午也发表广播讲话说，马尼拉市区情况“非常危急”，但军队中的大多数官兵仍然支持政府，希望人们对政府保持信心。德贝利亚也说：“我们正在集结部队，争取在晚间平息反叛。”
    据此间电台报道，约3000 至4000名政府军正在从南北两个方向朝马尼拉开进。估计，他们将于晚间抵达目的地。
    与此同时，应科·阿基诺总统的请求，美国总统布什命令美国驻菲律宾军事基地部队出动飞机，支援菲政府军。今天下午，美军飞机已盘旋在马尼拉上空。有消息说，在政府军的反击下，一些政变军人已投降。
    这是自1986年2月科拉松·阿基诺执政以来发生的第6次政变。前5次政变都被政府挫败了。1987年8月的第5次政变也是霍纳桑领导发动的。
