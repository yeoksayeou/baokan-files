National Day 1989. The entire country was in a festive mood. However, an unfortunate piece of news spread in Suining County, Jiangsu Province: Suining County Traffic Police Squad officer Luo Gang, while rescuing state property, heroically sacrificed his life while fighting a fire. The news of his death spread, and within a week, over 1,000 people spontaneously visited Luo Gang's home and workplace to pay their respects and offer condolences.

On the afternoon of September 29, 1989, at 2:30 PM, Luo Gang, a traffic police officer from the Shuangou Traffic Management Office in Suining County, was on duty on the Xuhuai Highway. Suddenly, a speeding truck stopped in front of him, and the driver urgently reported that a kilometer ahead, a cargo truck was on fire. Without hesitation, Luo Gang rushed to the scene.

At the 43K bend on the Xuhuai Highway, a Hino truck belonging to the Datun Coal and Electricity Company was ablaze. The truck was loaded with 300 circular tables with floral patterns, over 200 folding chairs, and a barrel containing 150 liters of diesel fuel. If the fire spread and caused an explosion, the consequences would be dire.

Luo Gang arrived at the scene and immediately began to maintain order and direct traffic, while also organizing the public to extinguish the fire and rescue the vehicle.

A truck arrived, and Luo Gang stopped it, asking to borrow a fire extinguisher. The driver promptly agreed: "Take it, putting out the fire is more important." Luo Gang jumped onto the truck, took the fire extinguisher, and hurried towards the fire scene.

The fire continued to burn fiercely. Luo Gang ran to the area with the most intense flames, and without waiting to steady himself, he picked up the fire extinguisher and pressed the trigger. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the fire extinguisher exploded, sending Luo Gang crashing to the ground in a pool of blood...

Luo Gang had only been working in public security for a little over a year, but in this short time, he had risked his life three times to rescue passengers.

On July 5 of this year, a long-distance bus from Suzhou flipped into a river near Shuangou Town, spilling fuel that caught fire on the water's surface, endangering the lives of over 40 passengers. Luo Gang and his comrades happened to be patrolling the area. He jumped into the waist-deep water, crawled into the bus, and rescued people. All 43 passengers were saved, and Luo Gang collapsed from exhaustion.

On the afternoon of September 5, after a light rain, Luo Gang, who was having lunch at the traffic management office, immediately left his meal to patrol the roads. As soon as he stepped out, he saw a private minibus from Tongshan County flip into a ditch over a meter deep on the east side of the traffic management office, with dozens of passengers crowded together. Luo Gang kicked open the car window and pulled the passengers out one by one through the window.

Luo Gang's Shuangou Traffic Management Office is located on the Xuhuai Highway, with a daily traffic volume of over 10,000 vehicles. The police duty points are not fixed, and there are no guardhouses. In the summer, under the scorching sun, the road surface temperature can reach over 60 degrees; in the winter, the north wind is biting, and water freezes instantly. From the day Luo Gang started his duty until his sacrifice, he was always the first to arrive at the designated location to perform his duties.

Luo Gang used his spare time to write three notebooks of reading notes. He applied the knowledge he learned to his work, achieving civilized and law-based management. In May of this year, a driver from the Fourth Team of the Xuzhou Transportation Company violated traffic regulations by speeding. The next day, Luo Gang found the driver and patiently explained the traffic regulations, handling the matter according to the rules, making the driver accept the penalty willingly. The third day, the driver and his unit leader presented a commemorative banner to the traffic management office, praising Luo Gang as the "guardian of highway traffic management and the confidant of motor vehicle drivers."

After joining the public security force, Luo Gang actively sought progress. On July 9, he solemnly submitted a party membership application to the party branch. In his application, he wrote: "I am loyal to the party, work diligently, and am ready to sacrifice everything for the party and the people at any time." He fulfilled his promise with actions. On November 12 of this year, the Ministry of Public Security issued an order: posthumously awarding Luo Gang the title of National Public Security Second-Level Hero Model.

    年轻生命献人民
    ——记全国公安战线二级英雄模范娄刚
    姜晓明　储一冰
    1989年国庆。举国上下，一片欢腾。
    然而，一个不幸的消息却在江苏省睢宁县传开：睢宁县公安交警大队民警娄刚，为抢救国家财产，在扑救烈火中壮烈牺牲。噩耗传来，在短短一个星期内，便有1000多人自发地到娄刚家中和工作单位凭吊慰问。
    1989年9月29日下午2点30分，睢宁县双沟镇交管所民警娄刚在徐淮公路上执勤。突然，一辆急驶而来的货车在他面前刹车了，司机火急火燎地向他报告：前方一公里处有一辆装货的卡车着火了。娄刚一听，二话没说，直奔现场。
    徐淮公路43K弯道处，大屯煤电公司的一辆日野牌载重货车正在熊熊燃烧，车上满载着300张创花板圆桌及200多张折叠椅和一只盛着150公升柴油的油桶，一旦燃烧爆炸，后果不堪设想。
    娄刚赶到现场，他一面维持秩序，疏导交通，一面组织群众扑火救车。
    一辆卡车开来了，被娄刚拦住，求借灭火机。这位司机很干脆：“拿吧，救火要紧。”娄刚跳上车，取下灭火机，大步流星朝火场奔去。
    火，还在无情地燃烧。娄刚跑到火势最猛的地方，没等站稳，就抱起灭火机，按动了鸭嘴开关。这时，只听“轰”的一声，灭火机突然爆炸，娄刚一头倒在血泊中……
    娄刚参加公安工作仅有一年多，在这短短的时间内，他曾3次冒着生命危险抢救旅客的生命。
    今年7月5日，宿迁市一辆长途客车在双沟镇不远处翻到路边河中，洒出的汽油在河面上燃起大火，车中40多名旅客的生命受到严重威胁。娄刚和战友们正巧巡逻到此。他跳入齐腰深的河水中，钻进车厢救人。43名旅客被救了上来，娄刚累得瘫倒在地。
    今年9月5日中午下了一场小雨。正在交管所吃午饭的娄刚立刻放下饭碗，上路巡查。刚出门，便见铜山县一辆个体大客车，在交管所东侧翻入路旁一米多深的水沟内，几十名旅客挤成一团。娄刚一脚踹碎车窗玻璃，将旅客一个个从窗口拉出。
    娄刚所在的双沟交管所设在徐淮公路上，每天车流量达1万多辆次。交警的值勤点不固定，没有岗亭。盛夏，烈日当空，路面温度高达60多度；隆冬，北风凛冽，滴水成冰。娄刚从上岗那天起，直到牺牲，总是第一个到达指定位置执勤。
    娄刚利用业余时间记了三本读书笔记。他把学到的知识运用到实践中，做到文明管理，依法管理。今年5月，徐州运输公司四队一名驾驶员违章超速行驶。第二天，娄刚找到这个驾驶员，耐心宣传交通法规，并按章处理，使对方心服口服。第三天，这位驾驶员和单位领导给交管所送来一面锦旗，称娄刚是“公路交通管理的卫士，汽车驾驶人员的知心。”
    娄刚参加公安工作后，积极要求进步。7月9日，他郑重地向党支部递交了入党申请书。他在申请书中这样写道：“我对党忠诚，积极工作，随时准备为党和人民牺牲一切。”他用行动履行了自己的诺言。今年11月12日，公安部发布命令：追授娄刚同志为全国公安战线二级英雄模范称号。
