A new type of energy-saving cooling tower fan, jointly developed by the Laizhou Cooling Tower Fan Factory in Shandong Province, the Shandong Academy of Sciences, and the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation, has recently passed national-level appraisal. This is currently the only domestic product of its kind to achieve a first-class quality rating, and it is on par with the most advanced international products of the 1980s.

This cooling tower fan began trial operations in February of this year. Calculating based on 6,000 hours of operation per year, a single fan can save 22,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, resulting in savings of over 100,000 yuan in electricity costs per year.
