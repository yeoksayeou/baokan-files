The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, failed to pay taxes on gifts they received during his term in office.

According to the U.S. government ethics law enacted in 1987, government officials and their spouses must pay taxes on gifts valued over $100 or on loans of property valued over $10,000.

According to reports by Time magazine and The Washington Post, Nancy Reagan frequently "borrowed" the latest designs from famous fashion companies. These companies were willing to lend clothes to the First Lady for free publicity. Some of these clothes were valued at over $20,000. According to tax laws, borrowing items and interest-free loans are similar, and thus should be taxed. While Reagan was in the White House, he had tax advisors who should have been familiar with the tax regulations for government officials. However, Reagan and his wife did not report or pay taxes on the gifts or borrowed clothes over many years.

The tax authorities and journalists discovered through their investigations that the dress Nancy Reagan wore to her husband's inauguration in 1981 was also "borrowed," valued at $25,000. The Galanos fashion company gave the "First Lady" the dress as a gift. It is said that she did not think about paying taxes at the time, but now she has agreed to pay the taxes owed.

In her recently published book titled "My Turn," Nancy Reagan also mentioned the issue of "borrowing" clothes. She said: "Because I needed clothes far beyond my own purchasing power, I borrowed from some of my favorite fashion designers and old friends for special occasions. I made a big mistake, not in borrowing, but in not stating from the beginning that I would return the original items."

    里根夫人“借穿”服装与纳税问题
    陈封
    美国国内税务局正在调查前总统里根夫妇在总统任期内接受礼物而未纳税的问题。
    按照美国1987年实行的公务人员道德法，政府官员及其妻子收受的礼品价值超过100美元或借贷财物超过1万美元，则必须向政府纳税。
    据《时代》周刊和《华盛顿邮报》报道，里根夫人南希经常“借穿”著名服装设计公司的最新样装，服装公司也愿意借总统夫人作活广告。有的服装价值在2万美元以上，按税法规定，借贷实物和无息贷款是类似的，所以应该纳税。里根在白宫时，手下有税法顾问，对公务人员纳税的规章理应相当了解，然而，他和他的夫人却在多年当中未就收受礼物或借穿服装申报纳税。
    税务局和新闻记者通过调查了解到，里根夫人在1981年出席她丈夫的总统就职典礼时所穿的那件衣服，就是“借”的，价值2.5万美元。迦拉诺斯服装公司作为礼物白送了“第一夫人”。据说她当时没有想到要纳税，现在答应补交。
    里根夫人在她最近发表的一本名为《轮到我了》的书中也特别提到“借穿”服装的问题。她说：“由于我需要大大超过我自身购买力的服装，我就为参加特殊集会而从一些我最喜欢的服装设计公司和老朋友那里借穿。这样，我就犯了一个大错误，错误不在于借，而在于一开始我没有申明我会将原物归还。”
