People's Daily Editorial

For some time, there have been rumors circulating in society that "such and such policy is going to change" or "such and such policy has changed," which has hindered the implementation of the policies for rectification and deepening reform. Therefore, it is necessary to give a clear answer to this issue.

Currently, as the work of rectification and comprehensive management deepens, doubts are mainly concentrated on economic policies. For example, will the policies for special economic zones and "three types of enterprises" change? Will the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, which is based on family management, change? Will the state's policies on individual and private economies change? In short, there is a fear of returning to the old path before the reform and opening up. Some people abroad and overseas with ulterior motives also propagate that "the policies of the Communist Party have changed" and "reforms have regressed," to confuse people and create chaos.

Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly emphasized that the general policy of reform and opening up will not change, and that the continuity and stability of the reform and opening up policies must be maintained. In his National Day speech, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "The various policies and measures regarding reform and opening up announced by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, including the basic policies and measures for special economic zones and coastal open areas, should continue to be implemented and gradually improved in practice." The State Council recently reiterated that the household contract responsibility system in rural areas will not change, the contract system for enterprises will not change, the factory director responsibility system will not change, the policy of developing various economic components under the premise of maintaining public ownership will not change, the financial contract system between the central government and local governments will not change, and the policies of introducing advanced technology, utilizing foreign capital, and attracting foreign investment will not change. This is the best answer to the doubts about "fear of policy changes." The rumors about policy changes in some places and units are groundless. The talk of "reforms regressing" is sheer nonsense.

Reform and opening up is the general policy of our Party. Only through reform and opening up can we better give play to the superiority of the socialist system. To adhere to reform and opening up is consistent with adhering to the four cardinal principles. Ten years of reform and opening up have brought significant economic development and notable improvements in people's lives. What reason is there to change the policies of reform and opening up? Of course, when we say "policies will not change," we mainly mean that the basic direction and content of various economic policies will not change, and we are not saying that there should be no supplements and improvements. Supplements and improvements are precisely to better adhere to the policies. Every policy, in the process of implementation, must be adjusted and improved according to the changing situation. For example, the financial contract system between the central government and local governments will not change, but some places have seen significant economic development and increased financial revenue over the past few years. Currently, there are difficulties in national finance and foreign exchange, and these places should contribute more to the state. This is a necessary adjustment made according to the development of the situation, not a change in the basic policy. The "continuity" and "stability" of policies and their "supplements" and "improvements" are not mutually opposed; they are all for the development of policies to a higher level and more conducive to the implementation of the general policy of reform and opening up.

The supplementation and improvement of policies are also the deepening of reform. The Party Central Committee and the State Council require special economic zones to vigorously utilize foreign capital and introduce technology, increasing exports from local production. This is precisely to give play to the advantages of the special economic zones and enhance their vitality and competitiveness. Utilizing domestic and foreign price differences for smuggling is not allowed, and stopping such practices is not a change in policy but a better adherence to the original policy. Cracking down on smuggling and other illegal activities is necessary to maintain the dignity of the law and social order. Regarding the policies on "three types of enterprises," it is well known that we now welcome foreign businessmen, foreign enterprises, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese to invest more than ever before. We are also formulating more perfect regulations and continuously improving the investment environment to enable investors to gain better benefits and create better conditions for the development of "three types of enterprises."

Individual and private economies should be encouraged to continue to develop. The People's Daily's response to readers' questions on December 6 reiterated this policy. As long as individual business owners and private enterprise operators operate within the law and pay taxes according to regulations, they can operate with confidence. During the period of rectification and comprehensive management, state-owned enterprises cannot increase many employees, and it is even more necessary to develop private enterprises and individual operations to invigorate the economy and provide employment. This is a contribution to the country and society. As for checking tax evasion, rectifying private enterprises enjoying tax concessions under collective accounts, and cracking down on fraud under the guise of collective names, this is strictly enforcing state regulations, not changing policies, but implementing policies.

To address the psychological concerns about "fear of policy changes," propaganda and education work is important, but more importantly, we must rely on the actual actions of strictly implementing the policies of the Party and the state. The masses are the most practical. Whether policies change or not, they will see it in practice. In a previous period, some places arbitrarily made regulations that were inconsistent with national policies. For example, the state stipulates that after farmers complete their grain contract purchase tasks, they can sell surplus grain on their own. However, some places stipulate that grain cannot be sold at markets, so it is no wonder that the masses complain that policies have changed. There are also places that say arbitrary levies and fees are central policies, causing strong dissatisfaction among the masses. This is absolutely not allowed and must be investigated and seriously dealt with. Such practices of ignoring the central government's repeated instructions, acting on their own, and arbitrarily changing policies must be firmly stopped, and the seriousness of the Party and state policies must be maintained. The facts show that where policies are not well implemented, there is unrest and work is affected; where policies are well implemented, there is stability and the economy is prosperous. This year, some places have reported a decrease in individual business owners, but Beijing, by continuing to firmly implement the policies on individual economies, has not only not seen a decrease in individual business households but has also seen an increase. By the end of November, there were 1.7 million more than at the end of last year, and business revenue has also increased significantly. It can be seen that to dispel the doubts of the masses and continue to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses to develop a socialist commodity economy with a plan, the most important thing is that all levels of leadership organs and leading cadres must act in accordance with the policies of the Party and the state.

To achieve the goals of rectification and comprehensive management and deepening reform, a stable environment is needed. Stability is paramount. The economy is the foundation, and to maintain social stability, all economic policies must be stable. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stated in the process of rectification and comprehensive management that the various policies that have emerged in recent years to promote the development of productive forces will not change, which is of great significance. It is hoped that the broad cadres will further raise their awareness of strictly implementing policies and work hard to overcome temporary economic difficulties and complete the tasks of rectification and comprehensive management and deepening reform.

### 党和国家的政策不会变

    党和国家的政策不会变
    一个时期以来，社会上不时有“某某政策要变”、“某某政策变了”的传言，妨碍了治理整顿和深化改革方针的贯彻执行。因此，有必要对这个问题做出明确的回答。
    当前，随着治理整顿工作的深入展开，疑虑比较多地集中在经济政策方面。比如，对经济特区和“三资”企业的政策会不会变；农村以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制会不会变；国家关于个体经济、私营经济的政策会不会变，等等。总之，怕回到改革开放以前的老路上去。国外、海外一些别有用心的人，也宣传什么“共产党的政策变了”，“改革倒退了”，来蛊惑人心，制造混乱。
    党的十三届四中全会以来，党中央、国务院再三强调改革开放的总方针不会变，要保持改革开放政策的连续性和稳定性。江泽民总书记在国庆讲话中指出：“党中央和国务院已经宣布的有关改革开放的各项政策、措施，包括经济特区和沿海开放地区的基本政策、措施，要继续贯彻执行并在实践中逐步加以完善。”国务院最近重申，农村实行家庭联产承包责任制不变，企业的承包制不变，厂长负责制不变，在坚持公有制为主体的前提下发展多种经济成份的政策不变，中央对地方实行财政包干的体制不变，继续引进先进技术、利用外资和吸引外商来华投资等对外政策不变，经济特区和沿海开放地区的基本政策措施不变。这就是对“怕政策变”的疑问的最好回答。某些地方和单位流传的政策要变的议论，是没有根据的。“改革倒退了”，更是无稽之谈。
    改革开放是我们党的总方针，只有改革开放，才能更好地发挥社会主义制度的优越性。坚持改革开放，同坚持四项基本原则是一致的。十年的改革开放，经济有了很大发展，人民生活显著提高，有什么理由要改变改革开放的方针、政策呢？当然，我们所说的“政策不变”，主要是指各项经济政策的基本方向、基本内容不变，并不是不要补充和完善。补充和完善正是为了更好地坚持。每一项政策在执行过程中，都要随着形势的变化根据实际情况不断调整改进。比方说，中央对地方的财政包干体制不变，但有的地方几年来经济有较大发展，财政收入有较大增加，目前全国财政、外汇有困难，应当对国家多做些贡献。这是根据情况的发展变化所做的必要调整，而不是基本政策的改变。政策的“连续”、“稳定”与“补充”、“完善”并不是相互对立的，都是为了使政策向更高水平发展，更有利于贯彻改革开放的总方针。
    政策的补充和完善，也是改革的深化。党中央、国务院要求特区大力利用外资，引进技术，从发展本地生产中增加出口。这正是为了发挥特区优势，增强特区生命力和竞争能力。利用境内外差价进行倒进倒出，本来就是不允许的，制止这种现象，不是什么政策变，而是更好地坚持了原有的政策。查禁走私等违法行为，那是维护法律尊严，维护社会秩序所必需的。有关“三资”企业的政策，众所周知，我们现在比以往更加欢迎外商和外国企业以及港澳台同胞、海外侨胞前来投资，并且正在制订更加完善的法规，不断改善投资环境，使投资者获得更好的效益，为“三资”企业的发展创造更好的条件。
    个体经济、私营经济要鼓励继续发展。本报12月6日就这个问题发表的答读者问中重申了这个政策。只要个体户和私营企业的经营者守法经营、照章纳税，就可放心经营。在治理整顿期间，国营企业不可能增加很多人员，更需要发展私营企业和个体经营，搞活经济，安置就业。这对国家、对社会，是一个贡献。至于检查偷税漏税现象，纠正私营企业挂到集体账号上享受税收优待，以及打着集体称号进行诈骗，这是坚决执行国家的规定，不是改变政策，而是落实政策。
    要解决“怕政策变”的思想顾虑，做好宣传教育工作是重要的，更重要的是，要靠严格执行党和国家政策的实际行动。群众是最讲实际的，政策变不变，他们要看实际。前一个时期，有少数地方擅自做出一些与国家政策不一致的规定。例如，粮食收购工作，国家规定农民在完成粮食合同定购任务之后，可以自行销售多余的粮食。但是有的地方规定不准粮食到集市销售，这就难怪群众抱怨政策变了。还有的地方，把乱摊派、乱收费也说成是中央的政策，引起群众的强烈不满。这更是绝对不能允许的，必须查清事实，严肃处理。这种不顾中央三令五申，自行其是、乱改政策的做法，必须坚决刹住，一定要维护党和国家政策的严肃性。事实说明，哪里政策贯彻得不好，哪里就人心浮动，工作就受损失；哪里政策贯彻得好，哪里就人心稳定，经济就繁荣。今年以来，一些地方传来个体户减少的消息，但是北京市由于继续坚定地执行关于个体经济的政策，个体工商户不但没有减少，还增加了，到11月底止，比去年底增加1.7万户，营业额也有较大增加。可见，要解除群众的疑虑，继续调动广大群众发展社会主义有计划商品经济的积极性，最重要的是各级领导机关、领导干部必须切实按党和国家的政策办事。
    实现治理整顿、深化改革的各项目标，需要一个稳定的环境。稳定压倒一切。经济是基础，要社会稳定，各项经济政策必须稳定。党中央、国务院在治理整顿中一再申明近年来在改革中应运而生的各项促进生产力发展的政策不会改变，意义十分重大。希望广大干部进一步提高坚决执行政策的自觉性，为克服经济的暂时困难，为完成治理整顿深化改革的任务努力工作。
