		People's Daily, Beijing, December 1 — Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Mingliang and People's Daily reporter Jiang Shaogao report: Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and State Councilor Li Guixian today met with chairmen, general managers, executive directors, and senior executives from 14 banks in Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong at the Great Hall of the People. Tian Jiyun extended a warm welcome to the foreign banking friends.

	Tian Jiyun told the guests, "I would like to emphasize two points: First, with the opening up of our economy and the development of foreign economic and trade relations, cooperation and exchanges between our financial sectors and those of foreign countries are inevitable. It is unimaginable to have economic and trade cooperation without financial exchanges. As far as I know, the financial institutions established by some countries and regions in China have been successful, with only differences in the scope of their business.

	Second, we are willing to work together with foreign financiers to overcome the temporary difficulties we face. Can we reach a consensus to focus on opening up the future? From the perspective of the Chinese government, we will make every effort to create a better investment and cooperation environment."

	Tian Jiyun expressed his belief that the temporary difficulties we face can be overcome, and our cooperation will develop.

	State Councilor and Governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, briefed the guests on China's current financial situation.

	Attending the meeting were also relevant officials such as Chen Jinhua, General Manager of China Petrochemical Corporation, Gan Ziyu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, and Zhou Daoheng, President of the People's Construction Bank of China.

    田纪云会见外国银行界朋友时说
    把着眼点放在开辟未来上  创造更好投资和合作环境
    本报北京12月1日讯　新华社记者赵明亮、本报记者江绍高报道：国务院副总理田纪云、国务委员李贵鲜今天在人民大会堂会见了来自意大利、法国、荷兰以及香港等国家和地区的14家银行的董事长、总经理、执行董事及高级职员40余人。田纪云对外国银行界朋友的来访表示热烈欢迎。
    田纪云对客人们说，我想着重说明两个问题：第一，随着经济上的开放和同国外经济贸易的发展，我国与国外的金融界的合作与往来是不可避免的，不可设想只有经济贸易的合作而没有金融上的往来。据我所知，现在一些国家和地区在我国所设的金融机构，都是成功的，无非业务范围大小有所不同而已。
    第二，我们愿意同外国的金融家们作出共同的努力，克服我们面临的暂时的困难。我们是不是达成这样一种共识，把着眼点放在开辟未来上。从中国政府来讲，将为创造更好的投资和合作环境作出最大的努力。
    田纪云表示相信，我们面临的暂时的困难是能够克服的，我们的合作是会得到发展的。
    国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜向客人介绍了我国当前的金融形势。
    参加会见的还有中国石化总公司总经理陈锦华、国家计委副主任甘子玉、中国人民建设银行行长周道炯等有关方面负责人。
