Strengthening Management for Them is More Necessary
— An Analysis of the Petition Issues of Mental Patients

	Summary: Our newspaper often receives letters and visits from mental patients. For this reason, the Mass Work Department of our newspaper conducted some correspondence surveys on these letter writers and visitors, and visited relevant departments. From this, it is evident that strengthening the treatment and management of mental patients is an important issue.

	Situation of Mental Patients Visiting
	Reporters: Wáng Yǒngmíng, Wáng Zǐxiá, Wáng Huáxīng

	This year, the number of mental patients visiting the People's Daily has been relatively high. According to incomplete statistics, from January to October, a total of 86 visits by mental patients were received, accounting for 8.6% of the total number of visitors, averaging nearly 9 visits per month, with the highest number of visits reaching more than ten per month. The majority of the visitors are male, totaling 68 visits, while females accounted for 18 visits. Most of them are over 50 years old. They come from 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The province with the highest number of visitors is Beijing, with 14 visits, followed by Shandong with 12 visits, Hubei and Anhui with 6 visits each, Hunan and Sichuan with 5 visits each. Among these mental patients, some start talking nonsense as soon as they enter the reception room, some shout and make a fuss, and some persistently bother others. There are also mental patients who linger at the newspaper's entrance for a long time, blocking pedestrians and vehicles, and looking for opportunities to enter the newspaper office. For example, a mental patient from Anhui, who is not a Communist Party member, claimed to have been the party secretary of a certain unit. He never held the position of a section chief but claimed that others had retaliated against him and removed his position as section chief. A female mental patient from Henan insisted that the public security department was controlling her actions with radio waves. A mental patient from Ningxia demanded to be the director of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Coal Bureau. A mental patient from Guizhou specifically commented on the People's Daily. When he saw the People's Daily report on the great potential of Guizhou, he said, "Chairman Mao said Sichuan has great potential, why do you say Guizhou has great potential? This is going against the current." A female mental patient from Gansu repeatedly blocked pedestrians and vehicles at the newspaper's entrance and tried to enter the newspaper office several times. Due to the large number of mental patients visiting, the normal work order of the newspaper office has been seriously disrupted, and it has also had a negative impact on the social order of the capital. It is hoped that relevant departments in various places will strengthen the management of mental patients in their regions or units to prevent a large number of mental patients from flowing into Beijing.

	Situation of Mental Patients Writing Letters
	Reporter: Lǐ Fèngmíng

	In recent years, the number of letters from mental patients to our newspaper has been increasing. On average, there are about 150 letters per month, with some patients sending a letter every few days, and some even sending one every day. The forms of writing letters are varied, including long theoretical articles, comments on the margins of newspapers, rhymes written on the back of cigarette boxes, and slogans. From the language expression, some letters have relatively normal thinking, fluent language, and neat handwriting, but most of the letters have disordered thinking, incoherent language, and off-topic content. For example, Jiang from Wenling County, Zhejiang, sends a news report on the county committee's focus on agricultural production every two or three days, using language from the Cultural Revolution. From the content of the letters from mental patients, they can be roughly divided into: attack type, this part of the letters, their targets of attack are mainly leading cadres, and some attack certain systems or policies; desire for power type, Sun from Xi'an often writes to a certain central leader, wanting to be his assistant, and some directly name a certain central leader saying that his position should be given to him; delusion type, a cadre from a farm in Fujian wrote that someone wanted to harm him with pesticides and chemicals. Pan from Baotou City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, wrote a letter cursing a certain woman for interfering in her life. Li from Chong'an County, Fujian, always "exposes" that someone in their county has joined a foreign intelligence organization; there is also a type of letter that discusses politics, economy, and current affairs, with long-winded arguments. There are countless examples like this.

	To keep abreast of the letter situation at any time, we sent inquiries to the units where the authors of the attack-type letters are located, and we have received 10 replies so far. The investigation shows that the letter writers are all mental patients. Their onset of illness is mostly related to some kind of stimulus.

	Example 1: Xu, female, 47 years old, university graduate. She originally worked for a certain newspaper in Sichuan. In 1969, she suffered from schizophrenia due to the persecution of her father, which led to the deterioration of her marital relationship. Currently, her condition is in a state of intermittent attacks, with one attack per month. During the attack, she exhibits symptoms of restlessness and hallucinations.

	Example 2: Yang, male, 29 years old, originally a worker at a certain forestry research institute in Fujian. He fell ill in 1983 due to a recruitment issue and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Since 1987, he has been writing and sending various materials everywhere.

	Example 3: Li, male, 52 years old, suffered from schizophrenia during his studies abroad in 1965 due to some kind of stimulus. He has been repeatedly ill for decades.

	These mental patients exhibit symptoms of hallucinations and writing during their illness. They generally do not leave home or harm others. When they are not ill, they behave politely and are no different from ordinary people. Therefore, relevant units and family members should pay close attention to their lives and conditions. Once they fall ill, they should be sent to the hospital for treatment in a timely manner to avoid causing trouble to relevant departments due to their writing and sending of letters, and even causing negative impacts.

	Voices from the Medical Community
	Reporter: Wáng Líng

	Regarding the situation of mental patients writing letters and visiting, the reporter visited relevant hospitals. According to some experts, mental patients writing letters to the newspaper is just one form of their abnormal behavior and does not necessarily have a clear motive or purpose. Their motives do not match the effects, and they are engaged in ineffective labor.

	It is also understood that the number of mental patients in our country is increasing, but the treatment and management of mental patients are still backward. Although the management methods are constantly improving, from the previous closed management (keeping mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and isolating them from the outside world) to open management (living with normal people, through social work and drug and psychological treatment to restore normalcy), due to the lack of psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric medical staff, most mental patients cannot receive the necessary treatment and management. According to statistics, in 1986, there were about 10 million mental patients nationwide, but there were only over 300 psychiatric hospitals and over 60,000 hospital beds. The hospitalization rate is only 0.6%. The Tibet Autonomous Region still does not have a single psychiatric hospital. To date, among the more than 100 medical colleges and universities in the country, none have a psychiatry major, let alone a psychiatry department. From the above situation, it can be seen that the treatment and management of mental patients in our country urgently need to be strengthened.

	Relevant experts call for: First, the state should establish relevant departments to be responsible for the treatment and management of mental patients, breaking the current unreasonable management pattern of the health, public security, and civil affairs departments each doing their own thing; second, improve the conditions of psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric health stations, and other mental health prevention and treatment institutions; third, solve the problem of personnel shortage in mental health prevention and treatment institutions as soon as possible, and improve the professional skills and treatment of existing personnel; fourth, strengthen community prevention and treatment of mental illness. Each administrative region should set up psychiatric health stations and other prevention and treatment points to form a prevention and treatment system that combines society and family, pay attention to the psychological treatment of mental patients, avoid adverse psychological environments, and reduce the incidence and recurrence of mental illness as much as possible.

    对他们更需要加强管理
    ——精神病患者信访问题剖析
    提要：本报经常有精神病患者来信、来访。为此，本报群众工作部对这些来信、来访者作过一些信函调查，并走访了有关部门，从中看出，加强对精神病患者的治疗和管理是一个重要问题。
    精神病人来访情况
    本报记者　王永明　王子霞　王华兴
    今年以来，到人民日报社上访的人中，精神病人比较多。据不完全统计，从1月到10月，共接待来访的精神病人86人次，占来访总人数的8.6％，平均每月近9人次，最多时一个月要接待十几人次。来访的精神病人男性占多数，共68人次，女性18人次，年龄多数都在50岁以上。他们来自20个省、市、自治区。人数最多的是北京市，共14人次，其次是山东12人次，湖北、安徽各6人次，湖南、四川各5人次。在这些精神病人中，有的一到接待室便胡言乱语，有的大吵大嚷，也有的纠缠不休。还有的精神病患者长时间滞留在报社大门口，拦截出入行人和车辆，寻机往报社里闯。例如安徽来的一位精神病人，他不是共产党员，却说他当过某单位的党委书记。他从未当过处长，却说别人对他打击报复，撤了他的处长职务。河南一位女精神病人硬说公安部门用电波操纵和控制着她的行动。宁夏一位精神病人要求当宁夏回族自治区煤炭厅厅长。贵州一位精神病人专门评论人民日报。当他看到人民日报刊登贵州大有希望的报道后说：“毛主席说四川大有希望，你们怎么说贵州大有希望呢？这是唱反调。”来自甘肃的一位女精神病人，多次在报社大门口拦截出入的行人和车辆，还屡次往报社里边闯。由于过多的精神病人来访，严重地干扰了报社的正常工作秩序，对首都的社会秩序也产生不良影响。希望各地有关部门加强对本地区或本单位精神病人的管理，以防止过多的精神病人流入北京。
    精神病人来信情况
    本报记者　李凤鸣
    近年来，精神病患者给本报写信有增无减，平均每月150件，有的患者每隔几天寄来一次，有的甚至每天都寄。写信的形式多种多样，有的是长篇的理论文章，有的在某报纸边角上批语，有的用香烟盒纸反过来写顺口溜，还有的是标语口号。从语言表达看，有些信思维基本正常，文字流畅，笔迹工整，但大部分信思维混乱，语无伦次，话题不着边际。如浙江温岭县的江某，每隔两三天就写来一篇报道该县县委抓农业生产的新闻稿，用的全是“文革”语言。从精神病患者来信的内容看，大致可分为：攻击型，这部分来信，他们攻击的对象，主要是领导干部，也有的攻击某种制度或某种政策；权欲型，西安市的孙某经常给中央某领导同志写信，要当其助手，有的干脆指名道姓说×××中央领导同志的位子应该让给他来当；幻觉型，福建某农场一干部来信说，有人想用农药、化学物品害他。内蒙古自治区包头市的潘某写信骂某女介入了她的生活。福建崇安县的李某，总是“揭发”他们县有人参加了国外某情报组织；还有一类来信专谈政治、经济、时事，好长篇大论。诸如此类，举不胜举。
    为随时掌握来信动态，我们对其中攻击型的来信，向作者所在单位发了函调，现已回函的有10件。调查情况表明，写信人，均属精神病患者。他们的发病大多与受某种刺激有关。
    例1：徐××，女，47岁，大学毕业。原为四川某报工作人员，1969年，她因父亲遭受迫害造成夫妻关系恶化而受刺激，患了精神分裂症。现在她的病情处于间断性发作状态，每月发作一次，发病期间，表现为吵闹不安，多幻觉。
    例2：杨××，男，29岁，原为福建某林业科学研究所职工，他是1983年因招工问题受刺激发病，住进了精神病院，1987年以后就开始乱写一些材料，到处投寄。
    例3：李×，男，52岁，1965年他在国外留学期间，遭受了某种刺激，患了精神分裂症，几十年来反复发病。
    这些精神病患者，发病期间的病态，表现为好幻觉，好写些东西，他们一般不会出走或伤害别人。不发病时，他们举止斯文有礼，跟常人一样。因此，对于他们的生活和病情，有关单位和家属，应密切注意，一旦发病，应及时送医院治疗，尽可能避免由于他们乱写乱寄，给有关部门带来麻烦，甚至造成不良影响。
    医务界人士的呼声
    本报记者　王玲
    就精神病患者来信来访状况，记者走访了有关医院。据一些专家分析，精神病患者给报社写信仅是其病态表现的一种形式，并不一定有明确动机和目的。他们的动机与效果不符，是在进行无效果劳动。
    又据了解，我国目前精神病患者的人数呈递增趋势，而精神病患者的治疗和管理还很落后。虽然管理方法在不断改进，由以前的封闭式管理（将精神病患者关闭在精神病院中，使之与外界隔绝）向开放式管理（与正常人相处，通过社会工作和药物、心理治疗，使之恢复正常）发展，但由于精神病院太少，精神病医护人员严重不足，致使绝大多数精神病人无法接受应有的治疗和管理。据统计，1986年全国约有精神病人1000多万人，却只有精神病院300多所，病房床位6万多张。住院率只占0.6％。西藏自治区迄今尚无一家精神病院。到目前为止，全国100多所医学院校中没有一所设有精神医学专业，更没有精神医学系。从上述情况来看，我国精神病患者的治疗和管理工作亟待加强。
    有关人士呼吁：一、国家应该设立有关部门专门负责对精神病患者的治疗与管理工作。打破目前由卫生部门、公安部门和民政部门各自为政的不合理管理格局；二、应改善精神病院、精神卫生保健站等精神病防治机构的条件；三、应尽快着手解决精神病防治机构人员短缺问题，并提高现有人员的业务素质，改善他们的待遇；四、加强对精神病的社区防治。各行政区域应设精神卫生保健站等防治点，形成一种社会、家庭相配合的防治体系，重视对精神病人的心理治疗，避免不良的心理环境，尽可能减少精神病的发病率和复发率。
