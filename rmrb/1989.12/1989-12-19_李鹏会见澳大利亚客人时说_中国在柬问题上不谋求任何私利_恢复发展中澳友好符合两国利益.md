Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th.

Reporter HÉ CHÓNGYUÁN reports: Premier Li Peng said this afternoon that China seeks no private gain in the Cambodian issue. China hopes that Cambodia can become an independent, neutral, peaceful, and non-aligned country. China welcomes all efforts that align with these goals.

This statement was made by Premier Li Peng during a meeting with Michael Costello, Deputy Secretary of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, at the Great Hall of the People.

Li Peng said that any proposal regarding the resolution of the Cambodian issue should have the unanimous agreement of the four parties in Cambodia. China particularly respects the views of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Only in this way can the aforementioned goals be achieved.

Costello presented the idea proposed by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans regarding the transitional power structure in Cambodia and hoped to understand China's stance. Li Peng expressed appreciation for the Australian government's long-term concern for the Cambodian issue and the efforts made towards its resolution. He said that both China and Australia hope for a fair and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian issue.

Regarding bilateral relations, Li Peng said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the relationship between China and Australia has been good. Despite some current differences, we still hope to quickly resume and develop friendly cooperative relations between the two countries, as this relationship not only serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries but also benefits the stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. We advocate looking forward and hope that both China and Australia will make joint efforts in this regard.

Costello agreed, stating that developing friendly relations between Australia and China serves the long-term interests of the peoples of both countries.

Li Peng also briefed the guests on the domestic situation. He pointed out that China's political situation is stable. China's economy is developing in a positive direction. With the implementation of the rectification and adjustment policies, the temporary difficulties we currently face are completely surmountable. Li Peng expressed that it is hard to imagine any foreign government dealing with a stable government that effectively exercises authority in a country with 1.1 billion people.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu and Australian Ambassador to China Stephen S. Fitzgerald were present at the meeting.

    李鹏会见澳大利亚客人时说
    中国在柬问题上不谋求任何私利
    恢复发展中澳友好符合两国利益
    本报北京12月18日讯　记者何崇元报道：国务院总理李鹏今天下午在这里说，中国在柬埔寨问题上不谋求任何私利，中国希望柬埔寨能成为独立、中立、和平和不结盟的国家，凡是符合上述目标的一切努力中国都是欢迎的。
    这是李鹏总理在人民大会堂会见澳大利亚外交贸易部副秘书长迈克尔·科斯特洛时说的。
    李鹏说，任何有关解决柬埔寨问题的建议都应征得柬埔寨四方的一致同意，中国特别尊重西哈努克亲王的主张，只有这样，上述目标才能实现。
    科斯特洛提出了澳大利亚外长埃文斯前不久提出的关于解决柬埔寨过渡时期的政权机构的设想，希望了解中国的态度。李鹏对澳大利亚政府长期以来关心柬埔寨问题并为此所作的努力表示赞赏。他说，中国和澳大利亚同样希望柬埔寨问题能够得到公正、合理的政治解决。
    在谈到双边关系时，李鹏说，中澳建交以来，两国关系一直是良好的。尽管目前出现了一些分歧，但我们仍然希望尽快恢复和发展两国的友好合作关系，因为这种关系不仅符合两国人民的根本利益，而且有利于亚太地区的稳定与繁荣。我们主张向前看，希望中澳双方为此作出共同努力。
    科斯特洛表示同意，他说，发展澳中友好关系符合澳中人民的长远利益。
    李鹏还向客人介绍了国内情况。他指出，中国的政局是稳定的。中国经济正朝着好的方向发展。随着治理整顿方针的贯彻执行，我们目前面临的暂时困难是完全可以克服的。李鹏表示，很难想象，任何一个外国政府不同一个在拥有11亿人口的国家有效行使职权的稳定政府打交道。
