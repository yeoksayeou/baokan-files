    The 6,000 officials from the districts, counties, and townships of Xingtai region in Hebei province began a one-and-a-half-month period of rural grassroots work on November 27. This initiative is aimed at implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenum and preparing both mentally and materially for a significant leap in agriculture next year, as stated by Li Mingzhu, the secretary of the regional committee.

    Xingtai region is a major cotton and grain-producing area in Hebei province, leading the province in both cotton planting area and production. The region has consistently exceeded the state's grain, cotton, and oil procurement plans. However, there are still some unfavorable factors hindering the advancement of agriculture. The regional committee and the administrative office have instructed the officials to fully trust and rely on the broad base of local officials, leading the farmers in improving agricultural water conservancy infrastructure; implementing the cotton, grain, and oil planting plans for next year at the village, household, and plot levels; popularizing agricultural science and technology, and promoting excellent varieties; and strengthening the construction of rural clean governance.

    "Riding in a small car, looking through the glass, the masses can't see you." This has become a common practice for some officials when they go to the countryside. The regional committee and the administrative office have demanded that officials change this bad habit, restoring and carrying forward the Party's fine traditions from the 1950s and 1960s. They should live in the villages, eat communal meals, participate in labor, conduct investigations and research, start from reality, and do the work quickly, well, and solidly.

    为粮食再上新台阶做准备
    邢台地区六千干部下乡抓落实
    本报讯　记者吴坤胜报道：11月27日，河北省邢台地区6000名地、县、乡干部奔赴各行政村，开始了为期一个半月的农村基层工作。地委书记李明珠说，这是地委、行署为贯彻落实五中全会精神，从思想上和物质上为明年农业大上做好准备而采取的一项措施。
    邢台地区是河北省的主要棉粮产区，棉花种植面积和产量均居全省首位，连年超额完成国家粮棉油收购计划。但农业要上新台阶，仍有一些不利因素。地委、行署要求下去的干部充分相信和依靠基层广大干部，带领农民抓好农田水利基本建设；逐村逐户逐地块落实明年棉粮油种植计划；普及农业科学技术，推广优良品种；同时搞好农村的廉政建设。
    “坐着小车转，隔着玻璃看，群众瞧不见。”这已成了时下一些干部下乡时的惯例。地委、行署要求下乡干部改变这种不良作风，恢复和发扬五六十年代党的优良传统，住到村里，吃派饭，参加劳动，搞好调查研究，从实际出发，把工作做快做好做扎实。
