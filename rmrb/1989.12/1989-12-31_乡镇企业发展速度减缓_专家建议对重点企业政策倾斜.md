Jiang Xia reports: The latest information from the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that the rapid development of township enterprises has been effectively controlled. The enterprise structure has been adjusted, and labor productivity has generally improved.

According to preliminary estimates from 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong, the total output value of township enterprises in 1989 reached 631.5 billion yuan, an increase of 14.8% over the previous year. This is significantly lower than the average annual growth rate of 33.5% during 1985-1988, and a decrease of 22.1 percentage points compared to the growth rate of the previous year. The development speed has notably slowed in regions with rapid township enterprise growth such as Tianjin, Shandong, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Jiangsu.

Various regions have closed, stopped, merged, or transformed a number of enterprises that consume a lot of energy and raw materials, compete with large-scale industries for resources, cause severe pollution, and are poorly managed and operating at a loss. In the aforementioned 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, approximately 520,000 enterprises were reduced this year, a decrease of 3.6% compared to the previous year.

In response to the current difficulties faced by some township enterprises, such as a shortage of funds, increasing debts, sluggish product sales, and increasing losses, relevant experts suggest that for a portion of key enterprises that comply with the state's industrial policies, can increase effective social supply, and have good management, a policy of preferential treatment should be implemented, providing the necessary startup funds.

    乡镇企业发展速度减缓
    专家建议对重点企业政策倾斜
    本报讯　记者江夏报道：国家统计局提供的最新信息表明：乡镇企业过快的发展速度得到了有效控制，企业结构有所调整，劳动生产率普遍有所提高。　　据京、津、冀、浙、苏、粤等19个省、区、市的初步预计，1989年乡镇企业总产值达6315亿元，比上年增长14.8％，大大低于1985—1988年期间年平均增长33.5％的速度，与上年的增长速度比，回落22.1个百分点。乡镇企业发展快的天津、山东、浙江、北京、江苏等地速度回落比较明显。
    各地关、停、并、转了一批消耗能源、原材料高，与大工业争原料，污染严重以及经营管理不善的亏损企业，上述19个省、区、市今年约减少企业52万个，比上年下降3.6％。
    针对目前部分乡镇企业面临资金短缺、负债额上升、产品销售不畅、亏损增加等困难，有关专家建议，对一部分符合国家产业政策、能增加社会有效供给和经营管理好的重点企业，实行倾斜政策，给予必要的启动资金。
