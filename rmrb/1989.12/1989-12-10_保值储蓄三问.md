Value-Preserving Savings: Three Questions

Recently, the rate of price increases has slowed, and the value-preserving subsidy rate has decreased. Starting next year, the value-preserving subsidy rate will change from being announced quarterly to being announced monthly. Some readers have written in to ask whether these changes will affect the interests of savers. Financial sector officials have responded to readers' concerns as follows.

Q: How is the value-preserving return rate calculated?

A: The price level for a certain period is usually represented by an index, indicating whether prices have risen or fallen compared to the previous period. By comparing the price index at the time of deposit maturity with the price index at the time of deposit, the rate of price increase during the deposit period is obtained, which is the value-preserving return rate. For example: A depositor has a 100-yuan five-year term deposit. The price index at the time of deposit was 112.9%, and the price index at the time of maturity was 183.2%. Therefore, the total return rate for this deposit is: 183.2% ÷ 112.9% - 1 = 62.27%; the total return amount is: 100 (yuan) × 62.27% = 62.27 (yuan). The value-preserving subsidy rate is the return rate minus the interest rate portion. For the depositor, in addition to receiving the normal interest at the time of deposit maturity, they will also receive the difference between the price increase and the interest, which is the value-preserving subsidy amount. In the future, banks can announce the value-preserving return rate at the same time as the value-preserving subsidy rate, so depositors will not have to go through the trouble of calculating the subsidy rate.

Q: Recently, the People's Bank of China decided to change the value-preserving subsidy rate from being announced quarterly to being announced monthly starting next January. What is the reason for this change?

A: The change from quarterly to monthly announcements of the value-preserving subsidy rate is mainly to protect the interests of depositors and make the subsidy rate more in line with reality. First, when calculating the subsidy rate quarterly, the price index used is from the previous quarter. This interval of one quarter significantly weakens the accuracy of the price index. If the calculation is changed to monthly, the price index from the previous month can be used, which is only one month apart, making the price index more accurate. Second, the quarterly announced value-preserving subsidy rate means that all deposits maturing within the same quarter use the same subsidy rate, but prices are constantly changing during this period, which cannot accurately reflect the impact of price changes on deposits. After changing to monthly announcements, the difference between subsidy rates will be greatly reduced.

Q: Recently, a three-year value-preserving savings deposit was made. How can the value-preserving subsidy amount at the time of maturity be calculated?

A: It is not possible to calculate the value-preserving subsidy amount for this deposit at present. The subsidy rate is determined by the price index, which means it depends on how much prices have risen during the deposit period.

Currently, some savings institutions, in order to attract deposits, calculate the value-preserving subsidy amount that will be received in a few years using the current value-preserving subsidy rate, which is undoubtedly incorrect. If prices can be effectively controlled in the future, with the annual average price increase rate equal to or lower than the annual interest rate, the value-preserving subsidy rate will naturally disappear. Of course, the bank will still pay interest to the depositor according to the current interest rate standard. For example, if the three-year term interest rate is 15.14%, then the bank will pay interest to the depositor at a rate of 15.14%. If the price increase rate is lower than the interest rate, the bank will not deduct the interest.

    保值储蓄三问
    近来，物价上涨幅度减缓，保值贴补率下降，从明年始保值贴补率又由按季公布改为按月公布。有些读者来信问，这些变化会不会影响储蓄户的利益。金融部门的同志就读者关心的问题作如下回答。
    问：保值收益率是怎样计算出来的？
    答：某一时期的物价水平通常是用指数表示的，表示这一期的物价比上期是上升还是下降了。那么，用存款到期时的物价指数与存款存入时的物价指数相比，就得出存款期间物价上涨幅度，这就是保值收益率。比如：某储户有一笔100元五年期存款，存款时的物价指数是112.9％，存款到期时物价指数是183.2％，那么，该笔存款总收益率是：183.2％÷112.9％－1＝62.27％；总收益额是：100（元）×62.27％＝62.27（元）。保值贴补率是收益率减掉利率部分。对储户来说，存款到期时除了得到正常的利息外，还要得到物价上涨部分与利息的差数即保值贴补额。今后银行可以在公布保值贴补率的同时，也公布保值收益率，这样就不至于让储户在贴补率的计算上绕来绕去了。
    问：最近，人民银行作出决定，从明年1月开始，保值贴补率由按季公布改为按月公布，这是出于什么考虑？
    答：保值贴补率由按季改为按月公布主要是为了保护储户的利益，使保值贴补率更加接近实际。首先，按季计算贴补率时，所使用的物价指数是用隔季的物价指数代替的。间隔一季度，这就使物价指数的真实性大大减弱。如果改为按月计算贴补率，就可以使用隔月的物价指数，只间隔1个月，使物价指数更加接近实际。其次，按季公布的保值贴补率，使得同一季度内到期的存款都使用一个贴补率，但这期间物价是不断变化的，这就不能更灵敏地反映存款受物价变动的影响。保值贴补率由按季改为按月公布后，贴补率之间的差距就大大缩短了。
    问：前不久刚刚存入一笔三年期保值储蓄存款，如何计算存款到期时能得多少保值贴补额？
    答：这笔存款能得到多少保值贴补额，现在无法计算。决定贴补率的是物价指数，也就是说要看存款期间物价上涨了多少。
    目前，一些储蓄所为了吸引存款，用现在的保值贴补率计算出存款在几年以后得到的保值贴补额，这无疑是错误的。如果今后物价能够得到有效控制，年平均物价上涨幅度等于或低于年利率，保值贴补率就会自然消失了。当然，银行要按当时的利率标准付给储户利息。比如当时三年期利率为15.14％，那么，银行要按15.14％的利率付给储户利息。如果物价上涨幅度低于利率，银行不会倒扣利息。
