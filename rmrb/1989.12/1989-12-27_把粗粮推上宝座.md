There is an old saying in China: "Medicinal supplements are not as good as dietary supplements."

Improving the nutritional content of staple and supplementary foods is a crucial topic in food research. However, merely adjusting the food structure to have nutritional value is not enough. Food must also be palatable, appetizing, and convenient to use, adapting to the fast-paced lifestyle.

It is well-known that the nutritional value of coarse grains is far superior to that of refined grains. Take "玉蜀黍" (corn) for example; it contains vitamins E, iron, phosphorus, zinc, calcium, and other essential trace elements that the human body cannot do without, which are several times to several dozen times higher than those found in rice and white flour.

The term "coarse grains" is not a fault of the grains themselves but rather because people have not processed them deeply.

The Beijing Modern Applied Science Research Institute is a privately-run research institution dedicated to researching healthy foods. They have successively introduced products such as "aluminum-free leavening agent" and "sweet treasure," and now they have introduced a new research achievement: "instant congee." The "instant congee" is made from carefully selected corn, without any additives, and is processed through multiple deep processing steps. It not only retains all the beneficial elements in corn but also has a smooth texture, a fragrant aroma, smooth granules, and an appropriate consistency. The "玉蜀黍" (corn), which has been disparaged as a coarse grain for generations, has been elevated to a high position among staple foods. The appearance of "instant congee" has opened a new path for the fine processing of coarse grains. Another feature of "instant congee" is its convenience: it can be prepared with hot water, hot milk, or even cold water and soda. After soaking for 5 minutes, it becomes a bowl of fragrant, appetizing, golden corn congee.

    把粗粮推上宝座
    濮思温
    我国有一句老话：“药补不如食补。”
    改善主副食中营养成份，是食品研究中的重要课题。然而，仅仅把食品结构改得具有营养价值也还不够。食品必须口感好，能诱人食欲，还要使用方便，适应快节奏生活。
    众所周知，粗粮的营养价值远远高于细粮。就以“玉蜀黍”（即老玉米）为例，其所含的维生素E、铁、磷、锌、钙等人体不可缺少的微量元素，比大米、白面高出数倍以至数十倍。
    粗粮被颁之为“粗”，其罪不在于“粗粮”本身，而是由于人们没有对它进行深加工。
    北京现代应用科学研究所是一个民办研究所，致力于研究健康食品。他们先后推出“无铝疏松剂”、“甜宝”，现在又推出一项新的科研成果——“即食粥”。“即食粥”以精选的玉蜀黍为原料，不加入任何添加剂，通过多次的深加工精制而成。它不但保持了玉米中各项有益人体的诸元素，食之口感细腻，清香扑鼻，颗粒润滑，稀稠适度。世世代代贬为粗粮的“玉蜀黍”推上了主食品中的高乘位置。“即食粥”的出现为粗粮精做开了新河。“即食粥”还有一大特点，就是使用方便：用开水、热牛奶，甚至凉水、汽水，渍泡5分钟，就是一碗香喷喷，诱人食欲的黄澄澄高级玉米粥。
