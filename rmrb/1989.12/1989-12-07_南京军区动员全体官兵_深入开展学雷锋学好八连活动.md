The Nanjing Military Region today held a military assembly, mobilizing all soldiers to extensively and deeply carry out activities to learn from Lei Feng and the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," to promote the spiritual civilization construction of the troops.

Lei Feng's former unit political commissar Zhang Huai Xian, and the commander of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," Li Chun Ming, were invited to the meeting. They respectively introduced the deeds of Lei Feng and the Eighth Company. The political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, Fu Kui Qing, spoke at the meeting. He said, Lei Feng is a great communist warrior, and the Eighth Company is an advanced collective that maintains the political character of hard struggle. They are all advanced models of the socialist era, shining examples set by Mao Zedong and the older generation of revolutionaries for the entire country and the entire army. He demanded that the subordinate troops' soldiers learn from Lei Feng's firm political belief of wholeheartedly following the Party, learn from the Eighth Company's virtue of resisting corruption and never being tainted; learn from Lei Feng's spirit of loving and specializing in one's work like a "screw," learn from the Eighth Company's high-mindedness of remaining untainted while living in the bustling city; learn from Lei Feng and the Eighth Company's noble quality of wholeheartedly serving the people, become Lei Feng-style soldiers, and build Eighth Company-style companies.
