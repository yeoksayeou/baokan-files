Mudanjiang Turns Pressure into Motivation to Overcome Difficulties and Contribute More

MUDANJIANG, Dec. 6 (People's Daily) — Facing challenges such as insufficient industrial production funds, tight energy and raw material supplies, transportation bottlenecks, product backlogs, and difficulties in recovering receivables, Mudanjiang City has taken a proactive approach. Instead of waiting for external help, the city has focused on self-reliance and striven for development, ensuring economic stability. In the first 10 months of this year, the city achieved a production value of 373,939 million yuan. State-owned industrial enterprises realized a profit and tax revenue of 33,602 million yuan, and the municipal fiscal revenue was 50,371 million yuan, representing increases of 7.7%, 10.67%, and 15.3% respectively compared to the same period last year.

At the beginning of the year, the city addressed the complaints and grievances of some enterprises by holding discussions on the current situation and tasks. In September, the city promoted over 20 exemplary enterprises, such as Huilin Rubber Factory and Mudanjiang Refinery, which had successfully overcome difficulties through self-reliance. This effort helped enterprises turn pressure into motivation, boosting their spirits and encouraging them to make greater contributions.

To ensure the stable development of industrial production in the city, the municipal Party committee and government leaders took responsibility for 109 profitable enterprises that contribute 71.5% of the city's tax revenue and key technological transformation projects. They provided guidance, offered solutions, and helped resolve difficulties. Simultaneously, the city adjusted the allocation of funds and electricity, directing the majority of new loans and electricity to large and medium-sized enterprises, ensuring that limited resources were channeled to the "national team."

The city also seized the opportunity presented by national adjustments and reductions. On one hand, it guided enterprises to focus inward, strengthen management, and increase revenue through potential development. On the other hand, it accelerated the adjustment of product structures. This year, industrial enterprises in the city increased the production of 56 essential items for daily life, basic industrial products, and export-oriented products. They reduced the production of 28 products with poor sales and developed 147 new products, achieving a production value of 13,000 million yuan. To address the issues of insufficient funds and product backlogs, the city formulated nine incentive policies for enterprises to mobilize and utilize their own funds, stimulating enterprise initiative. In the first nine months, industrial and transportation enterprises activated and utilized 16,968 million yuan through resource mobilization. Additionally, the city rewarded commercial enterprises that actively purchased and promoted local products, expanding sales channels. In October, the city's total industrial output value reached 37,229 million yuan, an increase of 3.1% compared to the previous month.

    变压力为动力闯难关
    牡丹江引导企业学赶先进多做贡献
    本报讯　牡丹江市面对工业生产资金短缺、能源、原材料、运输紧张，产品滞销，货款难回收等困难，不等不靠，自力更生，发奋图强，闯难关，求发展，稳定了经济。今年前10个月，实现产值373939万元，预算内工业企业实现利税33602万元，市级财政收入50371万元，分别比去年同期增长7.7％、10.67％和15.3％。
    年初，这个市针对部分企业产生的怨天尤人情绪，在龋市开展了形势任务讨论。9月份，又认真宣传桦林橡胶厂、牡丹江炼油厂等20多个自力更生渡难关的典型，使企业在困境中把压力变动力，振奋精神，多做贡献。
    为保证全市工业生产的稳定发展，市委、市政府领导成员对上缴利税占全市71.5％的109个盈利大户和重点技术改造项目实行分工包点，帮助出主意、想办法，排忧解难。同时，调整资金和用电结构，将新增贷款、电量的绝大部分用于大中型企业，使有限的资金和电量向“国家队”倾斜。
    这个市还抓住国家调整压缩的机遇，一方面引导企业眼睛向内，强化管理、挖潜增收；另一方面加快产品结构调整。今年市区工业企业增加了56种人民生活必需品、基础工业和出口创汇产品的生产，限产了28种销路不畅的产品，开发出147种新产品，实现产值13000万元。为解决资金短缺和产品滞销两大难题，这个市制订了企业资金挖潜自用的9条鼓励政策，调动了企业的积极性，前9个月，工交企业通过清资挖潜盘活松动资金16968万元。同时，这个市还对积极收购推销地方产品的商业企业实行奖励，扩大销路。10月份全市工业总产值达37229万元，比上月增长3.1％。　（王增伟）
