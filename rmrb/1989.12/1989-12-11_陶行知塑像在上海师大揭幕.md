On the 54th anniversary of the December 9th Movement, a marble statue of the people's educator Tao Xingzhi was unveiled today in Xingzhi Garden at Shanghai Normal University.

Tao Xingzhi spent a significant portion of his life in Shanghai, dedicated to education and revolutionary activities. After the December 9th Movement, he proposed the battle cry, "The life of the nation is the life of education; without national revolution, there is no life for education." In recent years, Tao Xingzhi's educational thoughts and revolutionary spirit have been increasingly embraced by students at Shanghai Normal University. Since last year, every new student entering the school has been required to study Tao Xingzhi's educational thoughts. This year, the school held an essay competition on Tao Xingzhi's educational thoughts, and today, awards were presented to 11 winners.
