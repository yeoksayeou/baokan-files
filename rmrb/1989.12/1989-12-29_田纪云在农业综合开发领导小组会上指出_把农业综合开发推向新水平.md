Tian Jiyun pointed out at the Agricultural Comprehensive Development Leadership Group meeting that agricultural comprehensive development has shown initial results, and it is necessary to further mobilize the enthusiasm of governments at all levels, cadres, and especially farmers, to push agricultural comprehensive development to a new level.

The National Agricultural Comprehensive Development Leadership Group held a full-member meeting in Beijing today to study some urgent problems in agricultural comprehensive development and to deploy work for next year. The meeting preliminarily decided to include some regions in Guizhou, Yunnan, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Fujian, Hebei, Shanxi, and Guangxi, as well as the transformation of oil tea forests in the south, as the first batch of key regions and projects for agricultural comprehensive development next year. This marks that China's agricultural development has expanded to some economically difficult but highly potential regions in the central and western parts.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun emphasized at the meeting that governments at all levels and various sectors should increase investment in agriculture through multiple channels and levels to promote agricultural comprehensive development. He said that the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee must be firmly implemented, and measures to attach importance to agriculture, support agriculture, and develop agriculture must be put into practice. While primarily mobilizing farmers to increase their investment enthusiasm, the state and local governments at all levels must also increase investment and tilt towards agriculture. In addition to the original agricultural funding channels, financial resources must be opened up at multiple levels and from multiple aspects to increase investment.

Tian Jiyun stressed that agricultural comprehensive development is a systematic project and cannot be simply understood as land reclamation. Especially in mountainous areas, the policy of comprehensive treatment of mountains, water, fields, soil, forests, and roads must be implemented, and efforts must be made in in-depth development.

    田纪云在农业综合开发领导小组会上指出
    把农业综合开发推向新水平
    本报北京12月28日讯　新华社记者张建军、本报记者吴长生报道：国务院副总理田纪云今天在国家农业综合开发领导小组会议上指出，农业综合开发已初见成效，要进一步调动各级政府、广大干部、特别是广大农民的积极性，把农业综合开发推向新的水平。
    国家农业综合开发领导小组今天在京召开全体成员会议，研究了农业综合开发一些急待解决的问题，并对明年的工作作了部署。会议初步确定，将贵州、云南、青海、陕西、福建、河北、山西、广西等地一些区域和南方油茶林的改造，列为明年第一批安排的农业综合开发的重点地区和项目。这标志着我国农业开发已扩展到经济比较困难、但很有发展潜力的中西部的一些地区。
    田纪云副总理在会上要求各级政府、各个行业要多渠道、多层次增加对农业的投入，推动农业综合开发。他说，必须坚决贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，把重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的措施落到实处。在首先调动广大农民增加投入积极性的同时，国家和各级地方政府必须增加投入，要向农业倾斜。除了原有的农业资金渠道外，要多层次、多方面地开辟财源，增加投入。
    田纪云强调，农业综合开发是一项系统工程，不能只理解为开荒，特别是在山区，一定要贯彻山、水、田、土、林、路综合治理的方针，在深度开发上下功夫。
