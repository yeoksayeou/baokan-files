The discussion focused on the situation in South Africa and the unity of the South African people.

    曼德拉会见南非工会大会代表团
    表示必须继续进行反种族隔离斗争
    新华社哈博罗内电　据南非《公民报》报道，被监禁的南非非洲人国民大会领导人纳尔逊·曼德拉12月19日在狱中会见南非工会大会代表团时说，南非人民必须继续进行反对种族隔离和争取自由的斗争。
    代表团发言人、工会大会副总书记西德尼·穆法马迪说，会谈在帕尔附近的维克特·沃斯特监狱里进行了6个多小时，集中讨论了南非形势和南非人民的团结问题。
    他说，曼德拉希望获得自由，但他不乞求自由，他也无法预料何时能被释放。
    曼德拉表示，在他被囚禁的情况下，不能与南非政府谈判。
    新华社卢萨卡电　据《赞比亚每日邮报》今天报道，南非非洲人国民大会（非国大）发言人西比纳说，非国大完全支持被监禁的非国大领导人曼德拉与国内一些民主运动领导人所举行的会谈。
    他说，对曼德拉19日与工会领导人的会谈，非国大表示特别赞赏。
    他驳斥了所谓曼德拉没有与在赞比亚的非国大总部商量就举行一系列会谈的指责。他说，包括与南非总统德克勒克会谈在内，曼德拉所进行的会谈，都与非国大进行过协商。
