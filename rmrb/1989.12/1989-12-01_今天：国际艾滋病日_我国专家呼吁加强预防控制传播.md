Today is "World AIDS Day." In response, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and the China AIDS Prevention and Control Research Foundation held an expert seminar in Beijing. Experts called for: strengthening monitoring and prevention to control the spread and prevalence of AIDS in China, which is imperative.

Since the United States first reported AIDS in 1981, the disease has spread to all five continents in just a few years. By October 31 of this year, 152 countries and regions around the world had reported cases of AIDS, with a total of 186,800 cases. Due to the average incubation period of AIDS being about eight to nine years, many HIV-infected individuals are only discovered and diagnosed with AIDS after a considerable period. According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that 500,000 to 1,000,000 people worldwide are currently infected with the AIDS virus, of whom an estimated 100,000 will develop AIDS in the next five years.

Professor Zheng Siwen, Director of the Institute of Epidemiology at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, introduced: The number of AIDS cases in some neighboring countries and regions of China is increasing rapidly, with Japan reporting 108 cases, India 32, the Philippines 26, Thailand 25, and Hong Kong 22.

Zheng Siwen said: "At present, there is no effective drug to treat AIDS. The world has not yet successfully developed an AIDS vaccine. China is currently in the stage of HIV infection prevalence, and the urgent task is to conduct large-scale serological monitoring to detect infected individuals early and prevent the outbreak of a large number of patients, thus entering the stage of AIDS prevalence."

Experts pointed out that strengthening monitoring of high-risk and key populations, such as sexually transmitted disease patients, prostitutes, intravenous drug users, homosexuals, users of imported blood products, returning seafarers, laborers, medical teams, students, hotel service personnel, border residents, overseas Chinese, contacts of AIDS patients, blood and organ donors, and foreigners staying in China for one year, can control the spread and prevalence of AIDS at an early stage with relatively little cost.

    今天：国际艾滋病日
    我国专家呼吁加强预防控制传播
    本报北京十一月三十日讯　记者艾笑报道：明天是“国际艾滋病日”。为此，中国预防医学科学院和中国防治艾滋病研究基金会在京组织了专家研讨会。专家呼吁：加强监测和预防，控制住艾滋病在我国的传播与流行，势在必行。
    自美国一九八一年首次报告艾滋病以来，短短几年艾滋病已蔓延世界五大洲。至今年十月三十一日，全世界已有一百五十二个国家地区报告发现艾滋病，病例数已达十八点六八万多例。由于艾滋病的潜伏期平均长达八九年，许多艾滋病病毒感染者在相当长一段时间后才被发现和确诊为艾滋病。据世界卫生组织估计，目前全世界已有五百至一千万人被艾滋病病毒感染，其中预计将有一百万人在今后五年内发展为艾滋病人。
    中国预防医学科学院流行病研究所所长郑锡文教授介绍：我国周围的一些国家和地区的艾滋病例数正在迅速增加，日本已报告一百零八例、印度三十二例、菲律宾二十六例、泰国二十五例、香港二十二例。
    郑锡文说：“目前还没有发现治疗艾滋病的有效药物。全世界至今也没有研究成功艾滋病疫苗。我国目前仍处在艾滋病病毒感染流行阶段，当务之急是必须进行大量的血清学监测，及早发现感染者，及早预防，以免突发大批病人而进入艾滋病流行阶段。”
    专家们指出，加强对性病患者、暗娼、静脉注射毒品者、同性恋者、使用进口血液制品者、归国的海员、劳工、医疗队员、留学生、宾馆服务人员、国境边缘地区及侨乡居民、艾滋病感染者的接触者、献血及献组织器官者、将在我国驻留一年的外国人等高危及重点人群的监测，就能及早以较少的代价控制艾滋病的传播及流行。
