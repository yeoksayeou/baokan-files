Edition: 6

"The Young Emperor" is the second historical novel by Ling Li, published last year. It has been seven or eight years since the publication of her first work, "Star Grass." "Star Grass" took ten years to complete, while "The Young Emperor" required five years of effort.

"Star Grass" received widespread acclaim. "The Young Emperor" is more mature than her debut work and, more importantly, it opens up a new dimension for Ling Li and contemporary Chinese historical fiction.

China has a long tradition of blending literature and history, and using literature to narrate history. Historical fiction has not only become the main genre of Chinese historical literature but also reflects the fundamental concepts of Chinese historical literature. The core of Chinese historical literature's aesthetic principles can be summarized as: using literature to convey history, and there is no literature outside of history. The function of historical literature is to popularize historical knowledge, to make history accessible through storytelling and imagery. Historical literature is "popular history." Ling Li's pursuit in "Star Grass" was to "recreate and explain historical facts," adhering strictly to historical records.

After completing "Star Grass," Ling Li reflected on her work. In "The Young Emperor," she made new attempts: shifting from "recreating historical facts" to "striving for realism," and beyond organizing, processing, and selecting a large amount of historical materials, she "boldly fictionalized," aiming to "reason and supplement historical possibilities." The emotional core of the entire book, the love story between the Shunzhi Emperor Fulin and the Consort Donggo Bo'erjijin, is not recorded in history and is a product of the author's artistic imagination, reasoning, and supplementing historical possibilities. This reasoning and supplementation of historical gaps are not just minor details; they are crucial to the portrayal of the three main characters—Fulin, Donggo, and the Empress Dowager—and influence the entire book's character relationships and plot development. The author's artistic structure aligns with the historical environment of the early Qing Dynasty, where there was conflict and fusion between the Manchu and Han cultures (marrying a brother's widow did not violate Manchu customs). Therefore, it has historical possibility and rationality. Additionally, events like the coup by the ministers of the Imperial Council and Fulin's impulsive decision to execute the Kang Consort are not recorded in history but are constructed by the author based on Fulin's implementation of new policies and "complete Sinicization," which caused sharp conflicts with the Manchu nobles. The book also contains many details that go beyond historical records. However, all these artistic reasoning and supplementation based on historical possibilities are not fabricated out of thin air.

"The Young Emperor" differs from "Star Grass" in its relatively free artistic handling of historical facts and records. On the other hand, Ling Li in "The Young Emperor" more consciously explores the relationship between writing history and writing about people, and writing history and writing about life. Traditional historical literature often focuses on historical and political events while neglecting personal affairs and emotions, or occasionally writes about personal affairs and emotions within the description of historical and political events, with historical and political events as the main focus. "The Young Emperor" does not follow this model. The protagonist Fulin, with his ambition to be a great ruler, his desire to unify the country, and his ideal of ruling with benevolence, is a new figure among the early Qing Dynasty's Manchu rulers. However, the novel does not follow the historical events and major turning points of the Shunzhi reign but instead focuses on the protagonist's thoughts on governing the country and his personal life. If we are to say it writes history, it is not the political history of a dynasty but the political, cultural, and emotional history of the protagonist. Historical events, personal affairs, political events, and personal emotions, the nature of the ruler and the nature of the people, historical traces, and human traces are all written about, and they are observed from the perspective of personal affairs, emotions, nature, and human traces to convey the ruler's career and historical traces.

From "Star Grass" to "The Young Emperor," Ling Li practices a transformation from writing history to writing about people, from recreating historical facts to recreating historical life. This transformation includes the writer's changing views on the function and value of historical literature, as well as the transformation of historical literature's aesthetic pursuits and creative models. This transformation not only has significance for the development of the writer's individual style but also for the development of contemporary historical literature from the domain and stage of "historical storytelling" to the domain and stage of "historical life."

"The Young Emperor" differs from previous historical literature not only in its approach to "historical life" but also in its exploration of "historical culture." The relationship between historical culture and historical literature is a significant topic in historical literature creation and theory, but it has often been overlooked. China's classical historical literature, such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," is a masterpiece rich in Chinese historical culture, storing and transmitting extensive Chinese cultural information.

Perhaps not from a theoretical understanding but from practical experience, contemporary Chinese historical literature writers have begun to consciously pursue historical culture, at least Ling Li did so when creating "The Young Emperor." The subject matter of this novel itself provides the writer with the possibility to realize this pursuit. The Qing Dynasty was another dynasty in Chinese history where a non-Han ethnic group took control of the central plains. After the Manchus entered the Great Wall, the rulers faced not only the challenge of military conquest but also the deep and intense cultural and psychological conflicts between the two ethnic groups. The military advantage was on the side of the conquering nation, but the cultural advantage was on the side of the conquered nation. The agricultural culture and feudal society culture of the conquered nation had a deterrent and assimilating effect on the conquering nation's nomadic culture and slave society culture. Emperor Hong Taiji, learning from the lesson of "the Jin Dynasty's Xizong who followed Han customs, wore Han clothing, and forgot his native language, causing the business of the ancestors to decline," ordered the Manchus to "not change the ancestral system in the future." His son Fulin, however, was not satisfied with being just a leader of the Manchu tribe but wanted to be the emperor of a great Chinese nation. Therefore, he implemented the policy of "Manchu-Han unity," adopting an open and accepting attitude towards the advanced Han culture, including the feudal political system, and embracing Han people, Han customs, and Han institutions, making some changes to the ancestral laws and old systems. What Fulin did was actually to stabilize the Qing Dynasty's rule and make it last for a long time. However, he faced strong opposition from the conservative Manchu nobles who insisted on old customs and systems. The political affairs of the Shunzhi reign were permeated with the conflict between the emperor and the Manchu nobles, externally manifesting as different political views within the Manchu ruling class, and internally reflecting the collision and confrontation between the two cultures. Corresponding to the dual structure of cultural conflict and fusion in early Qing society, the plot, scenes, and character world of "The Young Emperor" also exhibit the same cultural dual structure.

In terms of characters, Fulin, the Shunzhi Emperor, is a product of the fusion of Manchu and Han cultures: on one hand, he promotes "Manchu-Han unity," and on the other hand, he "first honors the Manchus"; on one hand, he reforms the ancestral laws and adopts Han institutions, and on the other hand, he feels guilty in his heart for violating the ancestral system; on one hand, he is fully immersed in Han culture, becoming a spiritual son of Han culture, and on the other hand, he fails to realize the humanistic ideal of "the weakness of Han people strengthened by the martial spirit of the Manchus, and the barbarism of the Manchus civilized by the refinement of the Han people," ultimately falling into the weak and decadent literary style of the Han people, wasting his ambition in a short life. Did he benefit from Han culture or was he harmed by it? Was his tragedy due to history placing a heavy responsibility on a person who could not bear it, or was it due to history placing a heavy burden on an era that could not bear it?

The characters around Fulin also embody the dual cultural characteristics of the times. Fulin's beloved consort, Bo'erjijin, with a Manchu father and a Han mother, embodies the fusion of the two cultures, symbolizing the humanistic ideal of "Manchu-Han unity." However, she mostly exhibits the characteristics of being assimilated by Han and Confucian cultures, and her life is a tragedy of being caught between the two cultures. The strong and wise Empress Dowager, who once fully supported her son Fulin's career, after her son's death, assessed the situation and drafted a new imperial edict, blaming herself for violating the ancestral system and adopting Han customs, and immediately abolished the new policies. In less than half a month, Fulin's lifelong efforts were in vain. The Empress Dowager, along with Prince Yinzhen and others, had a spiritual world based on Manchu culture but also incorporated Han culture. Princes like Prince Jing and a group of Manchu nobles had a different cultural structure in their hearts. They were filled with the consciousness of defending Manchu culture and hating Han culture. They followed the ancestors' example of "conquering the world with bows and arrows" and also wanted to rule the world from horseback. They often killed their slaves, taught their children to ride and shoot, and in their hearts, they longed to return to the grassland culture. They were not afraid to stage a coup to depose the young emperor who deviated from the ancestral system, with the intention of being loyal to the ancestors' business. The concubines living in the palace, such as the Consort Shuxian, had private grudges against Bo'erjijin and also public enmity—hatred for the "barbarian" culture. The Consort Jinxian, in an extreme form, expressed her strong racial cultural consciousness, personally killing Bo'erjijin's son and the possible heir to the throne, Prince Four, and herself facing death with a calm and tragic attitude, saying, "I have a loyal heart to the heavens." In these Manchu nobles, the conflict between the two cultures reached the point of no reconciliation. While more concubines and princesses, on the one hand, upheld the heritage of the early tribal women's bold and straightforward style, on the other hand, they fully appreciated and imitated the Han people's etiquette and daily life culture, revealing the inevitable trend of cultural fusion from another perspective.

The conflict and fusion of Manchu and Han cultures is a historical landscape that permeates the early Qing society. The writer Ling Li deliberately explores the historical and cultural characteristics of this era and its people, writing about a young emperor, a generation of nobles, and the soul of an era that once existed in the depths of history. This is more profound than the general "historical storytelling" and "historical life" creation. This opens up a new field for historical literature creation and raises the aesthetic pursuit of historical literature to a new level. Following this path, a new type of historical literature that is distinct from "historical storytelling" and "historical life," a historical literature that delves into the deep cultural structure of history, is expected to emerge.

In terms of showcasing Manchu culture, "The Young Emperor" is not as strong as showcasing Han culture. The novel's grasp of the Manchus' racial historical cultural consciousness and cultural psychological traditions is still not deep. This is partly due to the author's scholarly background, but more importantly, it is due to the author's lack of experience. The author has a deeper understanding of Han culture and Chinese ancient literature and history. The writer writes about the Qing Dynasty's life, but her historical research is not limited to Qing history but also includes Ming history and ancient history, giving her a historical grasp of the Qing Dynasty that goes beyond a single dynasty. She has knowledge preparation for the historical culture of the Han nationality, for Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Especially for the thoughts and ways of thinking of the literati, their emotions and ways of life, for the literary style of elegance and refinement and the literary style of meanness and vulgarity, she is familiar and detailed. She is deeply immersed in and influenced by ancient Chinese literature, including novels, poetry, prose, lyrics, songs, calligraphy, painting, and even the eight-legged essay. This makes the chapters in the novel where literati gather and disperse, and the chapters where Fulin interacts with scholars, poets, consorts, and monks, write about people discussing literature, poetry, music, Buddhism, and Zen, vivid and unrestrained. The author's literary and historical background makes this historical novel permeated with a historical cultural flavor. Some plots, details, and scenes are inspired by the essence of certain ideas, scenes, and images from classical works, or transformed and used. As for the elegant language and the classical and scholarly atmosphere that pervades the writing, both in classical Chinese and in vernacular Chinese, this is something that only an author immersed in Chinese historical culture can achieve.

    对历史文化的自觉追求
    ——评长篇小说《少年天子》兼谈历史小说创作
    滕云
    《少年天子》是凌力的第二部长篇历史小说，去年出版，上距她第一部作品《星星草》的发表有七、八年。《星星草》创作费时十载，《少年天子》付出五年之功。
      《星星草》曾受到广泛好评。《少年天子》较之处女作要更成熟，而且难能可贵地拓开了凌力本人以及我国当前历史文学创作一个新生面。
    我国历来葆有文史不分和用文学演述历史的悠远传统。历史演义不仅成为我国历史文学的主干体裁，还体现着我国历史文学的基本观念。我国历史文学审美原则的核心，可归结为：以文运史，史外无文。历史文学的功能就是向读者普及历史知识，就是通过故事化、形象化等文学手段，使历史通俗化，历史文学即“通俗历史”。凌力在《星星草》的创作中作出的也正是“再现史实，解释史实”，“比较严格地遵照史实去写”的美学追求。
    凌力在写完《星星草》后，就进行了反思。她在《少年天子》中作出新尝试：从“再现史实”变而为“力求生活化”，在对大量繁复史料的整理、加工、取舍之外，“进行大胆的虚构”，致力于“对历史可能性的推理和补充”。作为全书情感结构重心的顺治帝福临与董鄂妃乌云珠的爱情生活，就是史无明载，由作者发挥艺术想象，对历史可能性作出的推理和补充。这一对史料所不及或史料空白处的推理和补充，并非局部细节，它关系着全书三个主人公顺治帝、董鄂妃、庄太后形象的塑造，牵动着全书上下左右的人物关系和基本情节的前后发展。作者这种艺术结构，符合清初满汉两大民族冲突交融的历史环境，符合满族历史文化心理（兄娶弟妇并不违反满洲旧俗），所以是具有历史可能性与合理性的。此外，如议政王大臣济度们发动政变，如福临一怒之下封刀斩康妃，都于史无征，乃是作家根据福临推行新政、“全盘汉化”引起同满洲亲贵的尖锐矛盾这一历史现实，而移花接木结构的。书中还有许多细节描写也是超史料的。然而对历史可能性作的这一切艺术推理和艺术补充，并非凭空编造。
    对史实史料相对自由的艺术处理，是《少年天子》不同于《星星草》的一个方面。另一方面，是凌力在《少年天子》中更自觉地探索写史与写人、写史与写生活的关系。传统的历史文学，多密于史事、政事而疏于人事、人情，或在史事描述中间写人事，在政事铺叙中偶写人情，而以史事、政事为主。《少年天子》不循此模式。主人公福临怀抱做一代英主的雄心，统一天下的壮怀，仁德治世的理想，是清初满族统治者中的新派人物，但小说却不按顺治一朝的史事脉络与史事大关节去写，而依人物处理朝政与个人生活的心迹去写。要说写史，它不是写一朝政治演变史，而是写主人公的政治心态史、文化心态史、情感心态史。史事与人事、政事与人情、君性与人性、历史之迹与人生之迹都写到了，而且是从人事、人情、人性、人生之迹以观史事、政事，传达帝王事业与历史之迹。
    从《星星草》到《少年天子》，凌力实践着从写史到写人、从再现历史事实到再现历史生活的转变，其中包含着作家历史文学功能观价值观的嬗变，以及历史文学美学追求与创作模式的嬗变。这种嬗变不仅有创作个性发展的意义，而且有当代历史文学创作从“历史故事化”领域和阶段向“历史生活化”领域和阶段发展的意义。
      《少年天子》不同于以往历史文学之点，除对“历史生活化”的切入之外，还有对“历史文化性”的开掘。历史文化与历史文学的关系，本来是历史文学创作与历史文学理论的大题目，但历来被人们忽略不顾。我国古代历史文学的经典之作《三国演义》，就是一部蕴蓄着绝大的中国历史文化性内涵的典范作品，其中贮存和传递的中华文化信息至深至广至大至微。
    也许不是从理论认识上，而是从实践感知上，我国当代历史文学作家开始了对历史文化性的自觉追求，至少凌力在创作《少年天子》时是这样的。这部小说的题材本身给作家提供了实现这种追求的可能性。清代是中国历史上由非汉族入主中原的又一个朝代。满洲入关后，统治者面临的不仅是以武力实现民族征服，还要解决文化传统和文化心理上既激烈又深刻的民族对抗。武力优势在征服民族一方，文化优势却在被征服民族一方。被征服民族所代表的农业文化、封建制社会文化，对征服民族所代表的游牧文化、奴隶制社会文化，是有威慑力和同化力的。皇太极鉴于“昔金熙宗循汉俗，服汉衣冠，尽忘本国言语，太祖太宗之业遂衰”的教训，谕令满洲“后世无变祖宗之制”。他的儿子福临，则不满足于当区区满洲一部之酋长，而要做泱泱华夏大国之帝皇，所以执行“满汉一体”，对先进的汉家文化包括封建政治制度，持开放和接受的态度，亲汉人、习汉俗、承汉制，对满洲祖宗成法旧制有所更张。福临所做的，其实是稳固清统治基业使之长治久安的事情。然而他受到保守旧俗旧制的满洲上层贵族的激烈反对。顺治一朝政事，贯穿着皇帝与满洲亲贵的矛盾，外面表现为满族上层统治集团内不同政见的折冲较量，里面其实是满汉两种文化的撞击抗衡。对应着清初社会满汉文化（包括政治文化、人文文化、习俗文化等）对抗与融汇的二元结构，《少年天子》的情节、场景、人物世界，也展示着同样的文化二元结构。以人物而言，顺治帝福临，就是满汉文化合孕的产儿：他一方面推行“满汉一体”，另方面又“首崇满洲”；一方面改革祖宗法度承袭汉制，另方面又因自己违背祖制“心灵深处也觉得对祖宗不起而负担很重”；一方面全身心浸淫于汉家文化，实际上从精神上成为汉家文化的养子，另方面他在自己身上毕竟没有实现“汉人的文弱被满蒙的尚武精神所加强，而满蒙的野蛮又被汉人的文明所开化”的人文理想，到底堕入汉人文弱士风而在滥情、萎顿中消磨壮志匆匆走完短暂的人生历程。他是承了汉家文化之惠，还是受了汉家文化之误呢？他的悲剧，是历史将责任放在一个不胜重负的人肩上了呢，还是历史的重负放在一个不能担起的时代了呢？
    福临周围的人物，也无不赋有文化二元性的时代特征。福临无限钟爱的宠妃乌云珠，满洲为父，汉家为母，所谓“塞外风云江南秀色”兼于一身，正是两种文化对立与融合的象征和“满汉一体”人文理想的肉身化，其实她更多表现出受汉文化、儒文化同化的色彩，而她度过的却是满、汉对她两不认，在两种文化夹缝中艰难挣扎的悲剧人生。刚强练达的庄太后，曾全力支持儿子福临的事业，儿子死去，她审时度势，另拟顺治遗诏，以习汉俗违祖制罪己，并立即裁罢新政，不出半个月，顺治生前心血已尽付东流。庄太后，还有安亲王岳乐，精神世界都是基于满文化而兼取汉文化的二元结构。简亲王济度等一班满洲王爷，内心世界的种族文化结构另是一样。他们满怀固守满文化而仇视汉文化的意识。他们追随祖宗“以弧矢威天下”，也想于马上治天下。他们以虐杀家奴为常事，他们教子弟习骑射、吃大锅煮白肉，意识深处是向草原文化的回归。他们不惜发动政变，要废去背离祖制的少年天子，本心是对祖宗事业尽忠。生活在深宫的后妃们如淑惠妃，对乌云珠的嫉恨，既有私怨，也有公仇——对“蛮子”文化的敌视。谨贵人更以极端的形式表现着自己强烈的种族文化意识，她不能容忍“我们满蒙高贵的血里混进蛮子下贱的血”，亲手害死乌云珠所生并可能立为嗣君的皇四子，她本人视死如归，怀着“一片忠心可对上天”的平静和悲壮。在这些满洲亲贵身上，两种文化的对抗到了不共戴天的地步。而更多的后妃们、福晋们，一方面秉持早期部落妇女豪犷粗爽的遗风，一方面尽情赞赏并尽心仿袭汉家礼仪与衣食日用文化，从另一个侧面呈露着文化融汇的必然趋势。
    满汉文化的冲突与融合是弥漫满清初社会现实的历史图景。作家凌力着意发掘这个时代和人的历史文化性，她写出了曾经活在历史深处的一个少年天子、一代权贵、一个时代的心魂。这就比一般的“历史故事化”和“历史生活化”的创作深刻。这就拓开了历史文学创作的一片新垦地，并使历史文学创作的美学追求趋向一个新高度。循此以往，一种既区别于“历史故事化”，也区别于“历史生活化”的历史文学，一种进入历史的深层文化结构的历史文学，可望诞生。
    《少年天子》在展示满文化上，功力不如对汉文化的展示。小说对满人的种族历史文化意识和文化心理传统的把握，还不能说已达到深层。这里有学养上的原因，更主要的是体验上的局限。作者对汉文化，对中国古代文史，造诣要深得多。作家写清代生活而史学研修不限于清史，而及于明史、古史，这使她对清代生活有一种超乎断代的历史把握。她对汉民族的历史文化，对儒家、佛子、道教，都有知识准备。特别是对士大夫的思想与思维方式、情感与生活方式，对风流儒雅与委琐卑俗的士风，她熟察能详。她对中国古代艺文，包括小说、诗、文、词、曲、书、画以至八股制艺，或沉潜习染，或杂取旁收。这使小说中那些文人士子聚散的章节，那些福临与学士、词臣、爱妃、高僧相处的章节，写人物谈文论艺赋诗顾曲学佛参禅，写得笔酣墨饱挥洒自如。作家的文史素养使这部历史小说浸润着一种历史文化韵味。有些情节、细节、场景，得古典作品中某些构思、情景、意象的神髓，或化而用之。至于《少年天子》遣词用语之雅驯，那行文中洋洋乎流溢的古典气息，书卷气息，不仅充盈于文言，也充盈于语体，这也是非浸淫于中国历史文化的作者所不能道的。
