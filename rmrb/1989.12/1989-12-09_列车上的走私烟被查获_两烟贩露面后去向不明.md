After your newspaper published a letter titled "How 'Liangyou' Smuggled Cigarettes Were Brought onto the Train" on the sixth page on September 9, the leadership of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau and our sub-bureau paid great attention to the matter and established an anti-smuggling task force. The investigation revealed the following:

On August 5 this year, after the 298th train departed from Nanning, our sub-bureau's safety work group conducted a check of the carriages and discovered that the ceiling panels of the toilets in carriages 8, 7, and 4 were in an unusual state, having been locked from the inside. Due to a lack of tools, the panels could not be opened. The work group requested the train conductor and the on-board police to keep an eye on the situation and to handle it upon arrival at the terminal station.

On the morning of August 6, after the train arrived at Guiyang Station, the Guiyang Railway Public Security Sub-bureau's patrol team, armed with a tip-off telegram from the public, boarded the train and requested the train staff to assist in checking the ceiling panels of the toilets in carriages 8, 7, and 4. The conductor and the on-board police immediately complied. The patrol officers borrowed a steel spike from a worker passenger and pried open the ceiling panels of the aforementioned carriages, uncovering a total of 702 cartons of various brands of cigarettes. When the train staff and the patrol officers were counting the cigarettes in the dining car, two individuals dressed in railway uniforms approached the patrol officers to plead on behalf of the smugglers, but were refused. After that, the two individuals left the dining car and their whereabouts became unknown. Despite extensive investigations, it was confirmed that the two individuals in railway uniforms were not employees of our sub-bureau.

(The identity of these two individuals, the questions asked by the patrol officers during the plea, and how the smuggled cigarettes were hidden inside the ceiling panels are all issues that require further investigation.—Editor)

    列车上的走私烟被查获  两烟贩露面后去向不明
    你报九月九日第六版刊登《“良友”走私烟是如何带上列车的》来信后，柳州铁路局和我分局领导十分重视，成立了查烟工作组。据查证：
    今年八月五日，二九八次列车从南宁始发后，我分局安全工作组对各车厢进行检查时，就发现八号、七号、四号车厢厕所顶棚盖有异状，顶棚盖从内部锁死。由于缺乏工具无法启开。工作组下车时要求列车长和乘警注意观察，待车到终点站时再作处理。
    八月六日上午，列车到达贵阳站后，贵阳铁路公安分局巡警队持群众举报电报上车，要求列车工作人员配合检查八号、七号、四号车厢厕所顶棚盖。列车长和乘警当即予以协助。巡警人员从车厢一民工旅客借来钢钎，撬开了上述车厢的厕所顶棚盖，从中查获各种香烟七百零二条。当列车工作人员和巡警将这批香烟集中到餐车清点时，有两名身穿铁路制服的烟贩前来找巡警人员说情，遭到巡警人员拒绝后，便离开了餐车，去向不明。经多方查证，那两名身穿铁路制服的烟贩不是我分局职工。　（这两人到底是哪个单位的？他们说情时巡警人员是怎么询问的？那些走私烟又是怎么藏到了车厢顶棚盖内？看来，这些问题还有待进一步查实。——编者）
