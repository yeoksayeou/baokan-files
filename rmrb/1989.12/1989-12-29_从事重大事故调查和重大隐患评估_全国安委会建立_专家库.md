According to the decision of the State Council's executive meeting, the "expert pool" of the National Safety Production Committee was officially established in Beijing today. State Councilor Zhou Jia Hua presented certificates to 98 experts from various industries such as railways, civil aviation, and mining.

Zhou Jia Hua said that this expert group was established to better implement the "safety first, prevention-oriented" policy. Its tasks include conducting investigations into major accidents and assessing major hazards.

The establishment of the expert group signifies that China's safety production work will enter a new scientific track. These experts, selected from various departments, will not only conduct scientific, authoritative, and impartial investigations into major accidents but will also, under the authorization of the State Council, assess major hazards in key departments and enterprises. They will propose corresponding rectification and prevention measures and submit accident prevention legislative reports to the State Council, providing a basis for the country to formulate safety production regulations. At the same time, they will gradually establish and improve assessment standards and procedures, laying the foundation for future assessment work.

    从事重大事故调查和重大隐患评估
    全国安委会建立“专家库”
    本报北京12月28日讯　新华社记者赵明亮、本报记者王彦田报道：根据国务院总理办公会议决定，被称为“专家库”的全国安全生产委员会专家组今天在北京宣布成立。
    国务委员邹家华向来自铁道、民航、矿山等各行业的98位专家颁发了证书。
    邹家华说，这一专家组是为了更好地贯彻“安全第一，预防为主”方针而组建的，其任务是从事重大事故的调查和重大隐患的评估。
    专家组的成立，表明我国安全生产工作将走上新的科学轨道。从各部门精选出来的这批专家除对重大事故进行科学、权威、超脱性的调查外，还将在国务院授权下，对重点部门和企业的重大隐患进行安全评估，提出相应的整改和预防措施，并向国务院提出事故预防的立法报告，为国家制定安全生产法规提供依据。同时逐步建立健全评估标准和评估程序，为以后的评估工作打下基础。
