People's Daily, Dingxi, December 28th - Reporter Zhang Shusheng reports: In late December, the Communist Party of China's Gansu Provincial Committee held a provincial conference on learning from Lei Feng in Dingxi region. The conference decided to promote Dingxi's experience in political education and to launch a campaign to learn from Lei Feng across the province, pushing the construction of socialist spiritual civilization to a new stage.

In the first half of this year, the Dingxi Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to carry out ideological and political education activities centered on learning from Lei Feng in all primary and secondary schools in the region. Subsequently, the learning from Lei Feng activities quickly expanded from schools to society, from urban areas to rural villages. From May to the present, more than 8,000 Lei Feng learning groups have been established in the region, completing over 280,000 good deeds. More importantly, a large number of model individuals and advanced units who are dedicated to helping others, honest, selfless, providing excellent service, and serving the public with integrity have emerged, driving the improvement of social ethics and promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

The development of the learning from Lei Feng activities has made ideological and political education more concrete and vivid. The Dingxi Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward different requirements for various industries: schools should establish good school spirit and cultivate new socialist people; cadres should establish good work styles and serve the people wholeheartedly; workers should establish a sense of responsibility as masters and strive to do their jobs well; the whole society should advocate order, public morality, mutual assistance and love, and establish good customs. This avoids grandstanding and formalism.

Recently, the Gansu Provincial Committee decided to carry out the learning from Lei Feng activities extensively and in-depth across the province, requiring all localities to promote the Dingxi experience.

    甘肃推广定西抓政治教育经验  雷锋精神在黄土高原重放光彩
    本报定西12月28日电　记者张述圣报道：中共甘肃省委12月下旬在定西地区召开全省学雷锋现场会议，决定推广定西抓政治教育经验，在全省开展学雷锋活动，把社会主义精神文明建设推向一个新阶段。
    今年上半年，中共定西地委作出决定：在全区中小学开展以学雷锋为中心内容的思想政治教育活动。随后，学雷锋活动迅速由学校扩展到社会，由城镇延伸到乡村。从5月至今，全区有8000多个学雷锋小组，做好事28万余件。更重要的是涌现了一大批助人为乐、拾金不昧、舍己救人、优质服务、廉洁奉公、无私奉献的模范人物和先进单位，带动了社会风气的好转，促进了社会主义精神文明建设。
    学雷锋活动的开展使思想政治教育变得具体而生动。中共定西地委对各行各业提出了不同的要求：学校要树立好的校风，培养社会主义新人；干部要树立好作风，全心全意为人民服务；职工要树立主人翁责任感，努力做好本职工作；全社会要提倡秩序、公德、互助互爱，树立良好风气。避免了大轰大嗡和形式主义。
    最近，甘肃省委作出在全省广泛深入地开展学雷锋活动的决定，要求各地推广定西经验。
