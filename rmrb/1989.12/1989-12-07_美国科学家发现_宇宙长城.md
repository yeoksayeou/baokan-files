American astronomers recently announced that they have discovered the largest known structure in the universe to date, which they have named the "Great Wall of the Universe."

This galactic structure was discovered by scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge after observing approximately 6,000 galaxies at the Hopkins Observatory in Arizona. It stretches at least 500 million light-years in length, is 200 million light-years wide, and 150 million light-years thick. It is located 200 to 300 million light-years away from Earth and is invisible to the naked eye. On either side of it are vast, dark voids.

Previously, scientists believed that matter in the universe was evenly distributed. However, this discovery, along with several others, has refuted this hypothesis. They confirm that matter in the universe is distributed in a clumpy fashion.

    美国科学家发现“宇宙长城”
    美国天文学家最近宣布，他们发现了迄今宇宙中最大的星系结构，称之为“宇宙长城”。
    该星系结构是由坎布里奇的哈佛—史密森天文中心的科学家在美国亚利桑那州的霍普金斯天文台观察了约6000座星系后发现的。其长度至少有5亿光年，宽2亿光年，厚达1500光年，距地球2亿至3亿光年，肉眼无法看到。它两侧是黑黝黝的空穴。
    过去科学家们认为，宇宙间的物质是均匀分布的。但该发现和其它几项发现都否认了这种猜想。它们证实：宇宙间的物质是呈块状分布的。
