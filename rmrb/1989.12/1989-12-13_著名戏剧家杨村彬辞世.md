The world mourns the loss of a great artist. Today, prominent figures in Shanghai's cultural and artistic circles, along with people from various walks of life, bid farewell to the renowned dramatist Yang Cunbin.

Hundreds of wreaths lined the walls of the memorial hall, sent by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Shanghai Film Bureau, the Shanghai Cultural Bureau, and friends.

Born in 1911 into a poor family in Beijing, Yang Cunbin dedicated his life to the arts. He directed and produced many outstanding plays. Sixteen years ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. In the last ten years of his life, despite his illness, he completed the films "The Two Empress Dowagers," "Behind the Curtain," and "The Burning of the Summer Palace." He also directed numerous Chinese and foreign plays and Kunqu operas, including the renowned Kunqu opera "Pan Jinlian" and the dance drama "The Legend of Yu the Great," all of which he personally guided. Even this year, during his severe illness, he directed the Soviet play "Heart of a Dog" for a youth theater troupe.

Among the mourners were his students. He had taught at the Sichuan Provincial Drama Education Experimental School, the Shanghai Drama School, and the Nanjing Drama Academy. Today, his students are scattered throughout the country.

Among the mourners were also people from the grassroots. He had lived and worked in the Huai River conservation project in Su North and in industrial enterprises, where he made many friends. During his illness, workers from Shanghai frequently visited him, bringing him delicious meals.

Yang Cunbin passed away on the evening of November 24 at his residence in Shanghai, at the age of 78. He had served as a representative of the Third National People's Congress, a member of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, an advisor to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and joined the Communist Party of China in his later years.

Today's memorial service was attended by more than 400 people, including Bai Yang, Zhang Junxiang, Zhang Ruifang, Yuan Xuefen, Qin Yi, Wang Danfeng, Chen Shu, Wu Yiqiu, and Wang Yuanhua.

Wreaths were also sent by Liu Haisu, Xia Yan, Cao Yu, and Xie Xide.
