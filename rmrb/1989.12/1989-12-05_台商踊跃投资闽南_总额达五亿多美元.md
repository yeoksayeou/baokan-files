Taiwanese businesspeople have been actively investing in the Minnan region this year. By the end of October, investments by Taiwanese businesspeople in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou had reached over $500 million.

In recent years, Taiwan's capital has been seeking outlets, and many small and medium-sized enterprises have moved offshore. The Minnan region has done a great deal of work to attract Taiwanese investors. In Xiamen, whether it is government officials, tour guides, relatives of Taiwanese people, entrepreneurs, or taxi drivers, all actively introduce cooperation partners to Taiwanese businesspeople. In Zhangzhou, personnel from the department of foreign economic relations voluntarily handle project approvals, construction, recruitment, training, import and export customs clearance, and other matters for Taiwanese businesspeople. In Quanzhou, reception personnel provide Taiwanese businesspeople with information on suitable investment projects and conditions in advance. Xiamen has set aside large tracts of land for Taiwanese businesspeople to develop and invest in factories; Zhangzhou has opened up its rich mountain and sea resources for Taiwanese businesspeople to operate aquaculture and fruit and vegetable processing; Quanzhou allows Taiwanese businesspeople to cooperate with private enterprises and township enterprises to produce clothing, shoes, umbrellas, plastic products, toys, and other items. According to statistics, the three cities of Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou have approved more than 340 investment projects by Taiwanese compatriots. Currently, half of the approved projects have already started production and operation in Minnan, and the vast majority of enterprises have made profits in the same year they started production.

This year, Taiwanese-funded enterprises in Minnan have collectively increased their investments by tens of millions of dollars to purchase equipment, build factories, and expand production scale.

    台商踊跃投资闽南  总额达五亿多美元
    新华社厦门12月4日电　（记者蔡国烟）今年以来，台商在闽南地区踊跃投资。到10月底，台商在厦门、漳州、泉州的投资已达5亿多美元。
    近年来，台湾游资急于寻找出路，大批中小企业向岛外转移，闽南地区为吸引台商前来投资做了大量工作。在厦门，不管是政府官员还是导游员、台属、企业家、出租汽车司机，都主动为台商介绍合作伙伴。在漳州，对外经济部门人员义务代台商办理项目报批、基建、招工、培训、进出口报关等事务。在泉州，接待人员事先掌握适合投资的项目和条件，供台商参考。厦门划出大片土地，供台商开发和投资设厂；漳州敞开丰富的山海资源，让台商经营水产养殖和果蔬加工；泉州允许台商与私营企业、乡镇企业合作生产服装、鞋、雨伞、塑料制品、玩具等。据统计，厦、泉、漳三市共批准台胞投资项目340多个，目前，已经在闽南投产开业的占批准项目的一半，绝大多数企业当年投产当年赚钱。
    今年以来，闽南的台资企业共增资数千万美元添购设备、建造厂房扩大生产规模。
