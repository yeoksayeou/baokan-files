83-year-old former Burmese Prime Minister and honorary chairman of the Democratic Peace Force, U Nu, along with 13 other members, including the organization's chairman Bo Mya, have been placed under house arrest starting from December 30th. According to a report by the Burmese television news program, these 14 individuals were placed under house arrest under the 1975 Burmese Federal Law for the Prevention of Sabotage. The report stated that these 14 individuals are all members of U Nu's "shadow cabinet." The "shadow cabinet" was established in September 1988 after the State Law and Order Restoration Council took over the government. According to the report, in early November, the Burmese authorities had urged U Nu and his associates to disband their "shadow cabinet."

    缅甸前总理吴努等人被软禁
    八十三岁的缅甸前总理、民主和平组织名誉主席吴努及包括该组织主席波木昂在内的另外十三名成员从三十日开始被软禁。据缅甸电视台新闻节目报道，这十四人是根据一九七五年缅甸联邦防止破坏分子法被软禁的。报道说，这十四人都是吴努的“影子内阁”成员。“影子内阁”是在缅甸国家恢复法律和秩序委员会接管政权后于一九八八年九月成立的。据报道，十一月初，缅甸当局曾敦促吴努及其同伙解散他们的“影子内阁”。
