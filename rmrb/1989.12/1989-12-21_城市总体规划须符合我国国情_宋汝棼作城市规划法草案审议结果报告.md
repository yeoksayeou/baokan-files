Urban Master Plans Must Align with China's National Conditions
Report on the Review Results of the Draft Urban Planning Law

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th - Vice Chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, Song Rumeshi, reported to the 11th session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress today on the review results of the draft Urban Planning Law of the People's Republic of China by the Legal Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress.

Song Rumeshi said that the Legal Affairs Committee believes that to meet the needs of socialist modernization, to rationally formulate urban plans and carry out urban construction, and to ensure the realization of urban economic and social development goals, it is necessary to enact this law. The draft is basically feasible. At the same time, several amendments were proposed.

Song Rumeshi said that the draft stipulates: "The urban master plan must align with China's national conditions, be in line with the level of development of productive forces, and adhere to the principle of frugal construction." Some committee members and local and departmental representatives suggested that urban planning should also consider long-term development, correctly handle the relationship between short-term construction and long-term development, and avoid hindering the future development of the city. Therefore, it is proposed to amend this clause to: "Urban planning must align with China's national conditions, correctly handle the relationship between short-term construction and long-term development, and adhere to the principle of frugal construction."

Song Rumeshi said that the draft stipulates: "Before the municipal people's government submits the urban master plan to the higher-level people's government for approval, it must be reviewed by the same-level people's congress or its standing committee." Based on the opinions of some committee members and local representatives, it is proposed to amend the above provision to: "Before the municipal people's government submits the urban master plan to the higher-level people's government for approval, it must be reviewed and approved by the same-level people's congress or its standing committee."

Song Rumeshi said that the draft stipulates that in the urban planning area, land use for construction must have relevant documents approved by the state for the construction project, and apply to the urban planning administrative department for site selection. The urban planning administrative department shall issue a construction land planning permit, after which it can apply to the land management department for land use. Some committee members and local representatives proposed that this provision is necessary. To ensure the implementation of urban planning and maintain the seriousness of urban planning, corresponding legal responsibilities should also be stipulated. Therefore, it is proposed to add a clause in the chapter on legal responsibilities: "In the urban planning area, if land use approval documents are obtained without obtaining a construction land planning permit, the approval documents are invalid, and the occupied land shall be returned as ordered by the county-level or above people's government. For those responsible for the illegal approval of land use, their units or higher-level authorities can impose administrative sanctions."

    城市总体规划须符合我国国情
    宋汝棼作城市规划法草案审议结果报告
    新华社北京12月20日电　全国人大法律委员会副主任委员宋汝棼向今天召开的七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议作了全国人大法律委员会对中华人民共和国城市规划法草案审议结果的报告。
    宋汝棼说，法律委员会认为，为了适应社会主义现代化建设的需要，合理地制定城市规划和进行城市建设，保障城市的经济和社会发展目标的实现，制定这个法是必要的，草案基本上是可行的。同时，提出了一些修改意见。
    宋汝棼说，草案规定：“城市总体规划必须符合我国国情，与生产力发展水平相适应，贯彻勤俭建国的方针。”有些委员和地方、部门提出，制定城市规划还应当考虑远景的发展，正确处理近期建设和远景发展的关系，避免妨碍城市将来的发展。因此，建议将这一条修改为：“城市规划必须符合我国国情，正确处理近期建设和远景发展的关系，贯彻勤俭建国的方针。”
    宋汝棼说，草案规定：“城市人民政府在向上级人民政府报请审批城市总体规划前，须经同级人民代表大会或其常务委员会审议。”根据有些委员和地方的意见，建议将上述规定修改为：“城市人民政府在向上级人民政府报请审批城市总体规划前，须经同级人民代表大会或其常务委员会审查同意。”
    宋汝棼说，草案规定，在城市规划区内使用土地进行建设，必须持国家批准建设项目的有关文件，向城市规划行政主管部门申请定点，由城市规划行政主管部门核发建设用地规划许可证后，方可向土地管理部门申请用地。有的委员和有些地方提出，这个规定是必要的，为了保障城市规划的实施，维护城市规划的严肃性，还应当规定相应的法律责任。因此，建议在法律责任一章中增加一条：“在城市规划区内，未取得建设用地规划许可证而取得建设用地批准文件、占用土地的，批准文件无效，占用的土地由县级以上人民政府责令退回。对违法批准占用土地的有关责任人员，可以由其所在单位或者上级机关给予行政处分。”
