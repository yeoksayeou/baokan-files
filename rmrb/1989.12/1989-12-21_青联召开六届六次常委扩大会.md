The sixth plenary session of the sixth committee of the All-China Youth Federation was held in Beijing from December 18 to 19. The meeting analyzed the current situation facing the Youth Federation, studied, and planned work for the coming year. Liu Yandong, chairperson of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered a speech titled "Creating the Future Under the Banner of Socialist Patriotism."

Liu Yandong pointed out that every Chinese person, regardless of their ethnicity, occupation, beliefs, or cultural background, should cherish the love for their socialist motherland as a common thought and value. They should adhere to the principle of "one center, two basic points," starting from China's actual conditions, and consciously maintain the overall stability and unity. They should carry forward the spirit of hard work and selfless dedication, contribute to the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of China's national economy, and create a beautiful future for the motherland with their own labor.

The meeting decided to postpone the first plenary session of the seventh committee of the All-China Youth Federation to next year. The meeting commended and awarded 35 advanced collectives and 12 outstanding activities that emerged from the "Contribution Competition for the Seventh Five-Year Plan" held by the All-China Youth Federation.
