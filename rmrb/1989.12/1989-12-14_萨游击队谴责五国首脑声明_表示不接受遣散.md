The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (guerrillas) in El Salvador issued a five-point statement today condemning the joint declaration of the special summit of the five Central American presidents. The statement declared that the guerrillas would not accept any form of disbandment.

The political and diplomatic committee of the front provided the above statement to reporters, pointing out that the special summit of the five presidents was "using the hollow promise of disbanding the Nicaraguan anti-government forces in exchange for support for the Salvadoran government, helping the Salvadoran government to get out of the political, military crisis and international isolation it faces."

The statement expressed "disgust at the unconditional support of the five Central American presidents for the Salvadoran government; because the Salvadoran government has killed and persecuted church personnel, bombed civilians, and is the main human rights violator in the region."

The guerrillas' statement also pointed out that "the joint declaration of the five presidents is of no help in negotiating a solution to the Salvadoran problem. The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front will not disband due to inter-governmental agreements." The statement reiterated that the front "is willing to engage in serious negotiations with the government, including all political and social forces in the country, under the mediation of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar."

    萨游击队谴责五国首脑声明
    表示不接受遣散
    本报墨西哥城12月12日电  记者郭伟成报道：萨尔瓦多法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线（游击队）总部今天发表5点声明，谴责中美洲5国首脑特别会议的联合声明，表示不接受任何形式的遣散。
    该阵线政治外交委员会向记者提供的上述声明指出，5国首脑特别会议是“用遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装的空洞诺言来换取对萨尔瓦多政府的支持，帮助萨尔瓦多政府摆脱面临的政治、军事危机与国际孤立。”
    声明表示“唾弃中美洲5国总统对萨尔瓦多政府的无条件支持；因为萨尔瓦多政府杀害、迫害教会人士，轰炸平民，是中美洲地区主要的人权侵犯者。”
    游击队的声明还指出，“5国总统的联合声明根本无助于谈判解决萨尔瓦多问题。法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线不会由于政府间协议而解散。”声明重申，阵线“愿意在联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔的斡旋下，与政府进行包括全国各政治与社会力量在内的认真谈判。
