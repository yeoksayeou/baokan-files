Gorbachev Meets Genscher

Genscher Emphasizes the Indivisibility of European Borders; Gorbachev Says East Germany is a Guarantee of European Stability

New Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th. Soviet leader Gorbachev met with visiting West German Foreign Minister Genscher on December 5th, and the two sides exchanged views on the situation in Europe, particularly the changes in Eastern Europe.

According to TASS, Genscher assured Gorbachev that the West German government would adhere to the guidelines set by the Helsinki Principles and would abide by the treaties signed between West Germany and the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany. He said, "The inviolability of borders is the foundation of the entire European life."

Gorbachev said, "The Soviet Union regards East Germany as a faithful ally and an important guarantee of European peace and stability, and supports and assists East Germany."

On the same day, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze held talks with Genscher, discussing a series of issues including bilateral relations, the situation in Europe and the world, and disarmament. Notably, the issue of relations between the two Germanys was highlighted.

Shevardnadze criticized the stance of some individuals in West Germany regarding the development of relations with East Germany. He believed that linking the development of relations between the two Germanys with demands for East Germany to act according to the will of West Germany would lead to "extremely dangerous consequences."

    根舍强调欧洲边界不可破坏  戈氏说民德是欧洲稳定的保证
    新华社莫斯科12月5日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫5日会见了来访的联邦德国外长根舍，双方就欧洲形势，特别是东欧形势发生的变化交换了意见。
    据塔斯社报道，根舍向戈尔巴乔夫保证，联邦德国政府将遵循赫尔辛基原则所确定的方针，遵守联邦德国同苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国签署的条约。他说，“边界的不可破坏性是整个欧洲生活的基础”。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，“苏联把民主德国看作为忠实的盟友和欧洲和平与稳定的重要保证，并给予民德以声援和支持。”
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽同一天同根舍举行了会谈，双方讨论了两国关系、欧洲和世界形势、裁军等一系列问题，其中引人注目的则是两个德国的关系问题。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽批评了联邦德国一些人士在发展同民主德国关系上所持的立场。他认为，把发展两德关系同要求民主德国按联邦德国旨意行动联系起来会导致“极其危险的后果”。
