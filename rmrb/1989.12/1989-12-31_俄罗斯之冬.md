Under the azure sky,
Like a luxurious carpet,
Snow is spread out,
Greeting the sun with a radiant glow;
Transparent forests shimmer with a dark luster,
Pines pierce through the frost with green light,
A small river flows beneath the ice.

The Russian winter morning is a wondrous world. Every time I reread Pushkin's poem, it stirs countless thoughts, as if I were back on the vast Russian land, seeing the endless sea of forests and snow, the rows of graceful birch trees, and the dense green barriers...

Russian winter is a beautiful, pristine world. The cold not only displays its majesty to people but also brings them joy. Russian winter comes early; sometimes just after October, the fluffy snowflakes begin to fall from the deep blue sky. The Russian countryside in winter is like a beautiful painting. The rows of wooden houses are painted in various colors, with white snow covering the roofs. The red and white, green and white contrasts are striking, and the windows, adorned with various patterns and designs, are framed with a layer of pristine white lace, making it look like a massive piece of art.

After a heavy snowfall, Moscow is dressed in silver and white. From the highest point of Lenin Hill, the entire city looks like a world of jade and marble. The tree branches on both sides of the streets are adorned with fluffy, sparkling silver tassels. The evergreen pines are laden with fluffy, heavy snowballs. Under the morning sunlight, they cast a rainbow of colors. The pristine, tranquil world and the moist, fresh air truly invigorate the mind and spirit.

Russians are connoisseurs of severe winters. As soon as winter begins, people of all ages flock outdoors. Some strap on their skis and head to the countryside or suburbs to ski in the dappled sunlight of the birch forests. Fishing enthusiasts drill holes in the frozen rivers to fish. Those known as "dolphins" for their winter swimming, swim in the ice of the Moskva River at temperatures as low as -30 degrees Celsius. In the parks, for just a few rubles, one can ride a horse-drawn carriage or sleigh and experience the Russian charm.

The annual "Russian Winter" arts festival, held from the end of December to the beginning of January, is like a garden of flowers in this pristine world, attracting countless domestic and foreign tourists. During the festival, the nation's artistic elite gather, offering a rich and fulfilling artistic experience, from Glinka's classical operas to modern popular music; from Tchaikovsky's crystal-clear classical ballets to folk dances full of Russian rural flavor; from traditional revolutionary-themed plays to satirical political dramas. Evergreen performances like "Swan Lake," "Sleeping Beauty," "La Traviata," "Ivan Susanin," "Eugene Onegin," and "Carmen" are always captivating, making one feel the deep roots and great cohesion of Russian culture.

Perhaps it is because winter has trained people to adapt to nature and resist the cold, giving them vitality and enjoyment on the silent earth, that people have a special affection for it. According to Soviet tradition, on the last day of February, people celebrate the "Farewell to Winter" with various entertainment activities, garden visits, or sports competitions. On the streets, avenues, or squares, Russian samovars emit hot steam. People, after enjoying the festivities, sip a cup of hot tea at the stalls and savor the crispy, golden Russian pancakes, finding endless joy. This warm and steamy atmosphere dispels the cold, making one feel that spring is about to arrive.

    俄罗斯之冬
    张孟仪
    在蔚蓝的苍穹底下，
    像条华丽的地毯，
    白雪在铺陈着，
    迎着太阳闪着光茫；
    透明的森林黑光隐耀，
    枞树透过冰霜射出绿光，
    小河在冰下面流淌。
    俄罗斯冬天的早晨是一个奇妙的世界。每当我重读普希金这诗篇，便引起无数的遐想，仿佛又回到那辽阔的俄罗斯大地，又看到了那一望无际的林海雪原，那一排排婷婷玉立的白桦林，一道道茂密的绿色屏障……
    俄罗斯的冬天是一个奇丽、洁白的世界。严寒不仅向人们施展其威严，也给人们带来欢乐。俄罗斯的冬天来得很早，有时10月刚过，那鹅毛般的雪片就从湛蓝的天空中纷纷扬扬地降落下来。冬天的俄罗斯乡村就像一幅美丽的画卷。一排排木头农舍添上五颜六色，屋顶上盖满了白雪，红白、绿白相间、色彩对比强烈、由各种图案和花纹雕成的窗框也镶上了一层洁白的花边，简直就像一个庞大的工艺品。
    一层大雪之后，莫斯科城银妆素裹。从列宁山的至高点极目远眺，整座城市变成一个粉妆玉砌的世界。街道两旁的树梢上挂满了毛茸茸、亮晶晶的银条，在冬夏常青的松树上栽满了蓬松松、沉甸甸的雪球，在清晨阳光的照射下，幻影出一道道五光十色的彩虹。那洁白宁静的世界，湿润清新的空气，确实令人心旷神怡。
    苏联人是严冬的鉴赏家。冬天开始，男女老少纷纷到户外活动，有的背上滑雪用具到郊外或乡间，在阳光斑驳的白桦林里滑开了。垂钓爱好者们则在已经冰封的河面上凿洞钓鱼。而被人们誉为“海豚”的冬泳爱好者们，则在零下30摄氏度的气温下在莫斯科河浮冰间畅游。在公园里，只需花上几个卢布就可以乘坐一下马车或雪橇，领略一下俄罗斯的风情。
    每年12月底至1月初举行的《俄罗斯之冬》艺术节，就像这个洁白世界中的一个百花园，吸引着无数的国内外游客。艺术节期间全国艺术精英荟萃，从格林卡的古典歌剧到现代的通俗音乐；从柴柯夫斯基水晶般的古典芭蕾舞剧到充满浓郁的俄罗斯乡土气息的民间舞蹈；从传统的革命题材的话剧到针砭时弊的政论性剧目，给人们提供了丰富而充实的艺术享受。像《天鹅湖》、《睡美人》、《茶花女》、《伊万·苏萨宁》、《叶甫根尼·奥涅金》、《卡门》等长盛不衰的剧目更令人百看不厌，使人感到俄罗斯文化的深厚根基和巨大的凝聚力。
    也许是因为冬天锻炼了人们适应自然抗拒严寒的能力，使他们在沉寂的大地上获得生机和享受，因此人们对它有着特殊的厚爱。按苏联的传统，每年2月最后一天举行“送冬节”，人们举行各种娱乐活动，游园或各种体育比赛。街道林荫道或广场上，俄罗斯茶炊喷发着热气，人们欢乐之余在小摊上喝上一杯热茶，品尝那焦黄酥软的俄罗斯煎饼，其乐无穷。这种热气腾腾的气氛驱散了寒气，使人感到春天即将降临。
