Two foreign cargo ships capsized on December 8th while passing through Canada's St. Lawrence Bay due to encountering strong winds and huge waves. All 39 crew members on board are missing.

According to local newspapers, Canadian maritime rescue personnel immediately began rescue operations after the incident. However, so far, no survivors have been found, and the hope of finding them is slim.

The two sunken cargo ships are the "Johanna B," registered in Panama, and the "Capitán Torres," flying the flag of Vanuatu.

    两货轮在加东部海域沉没
    两艘外国货轮八日途经加拿大的圣劳伦斯湾时因遇上狂风巨浪而倾覆。船上三十九名船员全部失踪。
    据当地报纸报道，加拿大海上营救人员在出事后立即投入了营救工作。然而到目前为止，还没有发现任何幸存者，估计找到他们的希望很小。
    这两艘沉没的货轮是在巴拿马注册的“约翰娜B”号和悬挂瓦努阿图国旗的“托雷斯船长”号。
