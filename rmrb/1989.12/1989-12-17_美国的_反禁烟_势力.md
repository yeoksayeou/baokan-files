The United States has launched a nationwide "anti-smoking" campaign with great momentum and deep public support. Nowadays, more and more households hang "no-smoking" signs in their living rooms, and more and more companies and enterprises prohibit employees from smoking in the office... However, at the same time, there are signs that the "anti-anti-smoking" forces in the United States are also on the rise and are determined to "make a last stand."

The most powerful force is the financially robust American tobacco companies. Recently, when the World Health Organization criticized the United States for selling large quantities of American cigarettes without warning labels to third-world countries, the company publicly retaliated by saying that their cigarettes had obtained "sales permits" from the importing countries' governments and were therefore completely "legal products." This move left the World Health Organization both amused and bewildered.

The "National Tobacco Company Association," which has a large membership, defends the "rights" of smokers from a theoretical perspective. The association criticized the "anti-smoking" movement from a "civil rights" angle, pointing out that the anti-smoking laws enacted by the political and business sectors interfered with citizens' "private lives." A "brave" opponent of the "anti-smoking" movement sarcastically asked: Are they going to enact laws specifying what foods are "unhealthy"? Does the Constitution restrict citizens' diet and daily routines?

The newly established "Anti-Antismoking Alliance" has taken on the role of praising cigarettes as a civilian organization. It emphasizes that smoking can relieve fatigue, stabilize emotions, aid thinking, and even help with weight loss and fitness. An alliance trade expert "proved" with "concrete" numbers that the U.S. tobacco industry has helped the government "significantly reduce" the U.S. trade deficit. Another member of the alliance had an even more peculiar association, claiming: If smokers quit, the money they save might be spent on drugs, which would be even more dangerous.

Given the "arrogance" of the "anti-anti-smoking" forces, observers believe that the prediction by the U.S. Secretary of Health that "by the year 2000, the United States will become a 'smoke-free' country" will undoubtedly fail.

    美国的“反禁烟”势力
    唐若水
    美国在全国范围开展的“禁烟运动”声势浩大又深入人心。眼下，越来越多家庭的客厅中挂起了“免烟牌”，越来越多的公司企业不准雇员在办公室吸烟……然而与此同时也有迹象显示：美国的“反禁烟”势力也日渐抬头，并决心“负隅顽抗”。
    力量最大的首推财力充足的美国烟草公司。前不久世界卫生组织批评美国向第三世界国家大量销售烟盒上不加印警告的美国烟时，该公司公开反击说他们的香烟得到进口国政府的“销售执照”，因而完全系“合法产品”。这一招弄得世界卫生组织啼笑皆非。
    人多势壮的“全美烟草公司协会”则在理论上捍卫吸烟者的“权利”。该协会从“民权”角度分析批判了“禁烟运动”，指出政界和商界制订的有关的禁烟法干预了公民的“私生活”。一位反对“禁烟”的“勇士”以讥讽的口吻反问说：难道还准备制订有关法律明文规定什么食物为“不健康食品”？难道宪法将限制公民的饮食起居？
    新近成立的“反禁烟联盟”以民间社团的身份为香烟评功摆好。强调吸烟有解除疲劳、稳定情绪、帮助思考甚至减肥健身之效。该联盟的一位贸易专家以“确凿”的数字证明美国烟业帮助政府“大大减少”了美国的外贸赤字。另一位盟员“联想”得更为奇特，声称：如果吸烟者戒了烟，省下的钱又去买毒品，那岂不是更为危险？
    鉴于“反禁烟”势力如此“嚣张”，观察家们认为美国卫生部部长“公元2000年时美国将成为‘无烟国’”的预言无疑会落空。
