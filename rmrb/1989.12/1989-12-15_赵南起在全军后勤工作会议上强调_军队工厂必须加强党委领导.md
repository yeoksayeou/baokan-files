    Zhao Nanqi emphasized at the army logistics work conference that military factories must strengthen party committee leadership. Our reporter Luo Tongsong reported from Beijing on December 14: “Military factories (enterprises) must adhere to the system of the factory director and party secretary sharing responsibilities under the leadership of the party committee.” This was emphasized by General Zhao Nanqi, member of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, at the army logistics work conference held on December 13.

    During the conference, the reporter asked Zhao Nanqi for his views on this issue. He said that military factories are under the leadership of the military and must first serve military construction. This special characteristic, distinct from local factories and enterprises, determines that they must strengthen party committee leadership.

    Zhao Nanqi recalled that for decades, the factories under our military have consistently adhered to the system of the factory director and party secretary sharing responsibilities under the leadership of the party committee, forming excellent traditions. In recent years, the entire army's factories have adhered to this system, which has played an active role in strengthening ideological and political work, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the worker masses, selecting outstanding talents, strengthening spiritual civilization construction, and developing production. It is precisely because of the effective leadership of the party committee that during the turmoil this year, the workers of all military-owned factories loved the Communist Party, adhered to the socialist road, and remained at their production posts.

    Zhao Nanqi said that the party committee leadership of military factories is consistent with the implementation of the "Enterprise Law." He emphasized that the party committee of military factories must first manage the party well, truly build the party committee and branches into strong fighting fortresses, and ensure that the lines, policies, and guidelines of the Party Central Committee are smoothly implemented in the factories. Specifically, the party committee should manage the organization, ideology (propaganda), cadres, trade unions, and armed forces. The "five managements" are to ensure that the factory director can focus on production.

    赵南起在全军后勤工作会议上强调
    军队工厂必须加强党委领导
    本报北京12月14日讯　记者罗同松报道：“军队工厂（企业）要坚持党委领导下的厂长、书记分工负责制”。这是中央军委委员、中国人民解放军总后勤部部长赵南起上将在13日开幕的全军后勤工作会议上强调的。
    会间，记者就这个问题请赵南起谈谈看法。他说，军队工厂隶属于军队领导，它首先要服务于军队建设。这种有别于地方工厂企业的特殊性，决定了它必须加强党委领导。
    赵南起回顾说，几十年来，我军所属的工厂一直坚持了党委领导下的厂长、书记分工负责制，形成了优良传统。近些年来，全军工厂坚持这一制度，对于加强思想政治工作，调动工人群众积极性，选拔优秀人才，加强精神文明建设，发展生产，起到了积极作用。正是由于党委领导得力，因此，在今年的动乱期间，全军所属工厂的职工热爱共产党，坚持社会主义道路，始终坚持在生产岗位上。
    赵南起说，军队工厂坚持党委领导与执行《企业法》是一致的。他强调，军队工厂的党委首先是要管好党，真正把党委和支部建设成坚强的战斗堡垒，使党中央的路线、方针、政策在工厂得以顺畅地贯彻执行。具体来说，党委要管组织、管思想（宣传）、管干部、管工会、管武装。“五管”正是为了保证厂长抓好生产。
