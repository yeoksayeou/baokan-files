The Gap Still Exists
- A Commentary on the Fourth Lomé Convention

After a lengthy and arduous negotiation, the 12 countries of the European Community and 68 countries from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific signed the fourth Lomé Convention in the capital of Togo on December 15. According to this convention, the European Community will provide the signatory countries of the ACP (Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific) with a total of 12 billion European Currency Units (approximately $13.2 billion) in grants and preferential loans over the next five years. The convention will come into effect on February 1, 1990. This is an important economic and trade agreement signed between the South and the North.

Compared to the atmosphere when the first three conventions were signed, the enthusiasm of the ACP countries has significantly waned. The host country's President Eyadéma strongly urged the European Community not to improve relations with some countries at the expense of old friends. He suggested holding a meeting between the European Community and the ACP countries to discuss and formulate aid and compensation measures for the ACP countries after the "Uruguay Round" of international trade negotiations and the establishment of the European single market in 1992. He said, "As long as a few people control most of the wealth on this planet and keep the majority in a state of long-term poverty and dependence, there can be no true peace in the world." Third World countries "are being suffocated by debt burdens, deteriorating trade conditions, unemployment, and inflation, which is the real danger."

The Lomé Convention is an economic and trade agreement between the European Community countries and the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. Many of these developing countries were formerly colonies of Britain and France. The first convention was signed on February 28, 1975, in the capital of Togo, Lomé, hence the name Lomé Convention. The convention is valid for five years, and it has been renewed twice, in October 1979 and December 1984, due to its expiration. The convention stipulates that the European Community should provide preferential treatment to the ACP countries in promoting industrialization, financial and technological assistance, tariffs, and stabilizing export revenues. The aid amounts for the first three conventions were 3.5 billion, 5.607 billion, and 8.5 billion European Currency Units, respectively. In addition to directly funding development projects in the ACP countries, a significant portion of these funds is specifically used to stabilize the export revenues of the ACP countries' primary products.

Indeed, these measures have played a certain role in helping the ACP countries overcome economic difficulties and mitigate their losses in export revenues. However, due to the insufficient total amount of income stabilization subsidies, they often cannot meet the subsidy application requirements of the exporting countries. For example, in 1988, the ACP countries requested the European Community to subsidize 5.79 billion European Currency Units due to the sharp drop in prices of tropical crops such as coffee and cocoa, but the actual amount approved was only 3.75 billion European Currency Units. For instance, in 1988, Côte d'Ivoire's export revenue loss was 600 billion West African francs, but the subsidy received was only 400 billion West African francs. It is precisely because of the irrational international economic order that from 1980 to 1987, the purchasing power of the ACP countries decreased by 64%, and the gap between the South and the North further widened.

Given that the first three Lomé Conventions did not prevent the impoverishment of the ACP countries and lead them to a healthy and stable development path, these third-world countries had high hopes for the fourth Lomé Convention. They had requested the European Community to increase financial aid, raise the fund for stabilizing export revenues, and hoped to reform the existing export revenue stabilization system, relax the compensation restrictions, etc. Although the aid amount of this convention is significantly higher than the previous three, due to the fact that the aforementioned reasonable requests of the ACP countries have not been seriously discussed and addressed, some of them have even been flatly rejected, resulting in widespread disappointment among the ACP countries.

The Côte d'Ivoire "L'Aube" newspaper pointed out in a signed article, "The cooperation between the European Community and the ACP countries is a combination of mutual interests. Since the signing of the agreement, both parties have benefited from it. The current problem is that the ACP countries have been harmed." The Senegalese Minister of Commerce appealed, "It is clear that the European Community can propose a reform plan to alleviate people's concerns, and it all depends on whether it is truly sincere."

### 差距仍然存在——评述第四个《洛美协定》

    差距仍然存在
    ——评述第四个《洛美协定》
    本报记者　杨汝生
    经过长时间艰苦的谈判，欧共体12国和非洲、加勒比、太平洋地区68国于12月15日在多哥首都签署了第4个《洛美协定》。根据这一协定，欧共体在未来的5年内将向非加太签约国提供总数为120亿欧洲货币单位（约合132亿美元）的赠款和优惠贷款。协定自1990年2月起生效。这是一项南北国家签定的重要的经贸协定。
    与前三个协定签定时的气氛相比，非加太国家的热情已大大减退。东道国总统埃亚德马在致词中强烈要求欧共体不要为了改善同一些国家的关系而损害了老朋友的利益。他建议召开一次欧共体和非加太国家的会议，以便讨论制订一项在“乌拉圭回合”国际贸易谈判和1992年欧洲大市场建立之后对非加太国家的援助和补偿措施。他说：“只要少数人掌握着这个星球上的大部分财富并使大多数人长期陷入贫困和依附的状态，世界上就没有真正的和平”。第三世界国家“被债务负担、贸易条件恶化、失业和通货膨胀压的喘不过气来，这才是真正的危险。”
      《洛美协定》是欧共体国家和非洲、加勒比、太平洋地区发展中国家之间的经贸协定，这些发展中国家过去不少是英法的殖民地。协定第一次签定的时间是1975年2月28日，因在多哥首都洛美签字，故称《洛美协定》。协定有效期为5年，1979年10月和1984年12月因协定到期续签过两次。协定规定，欧共体应该在促进工业化、金融和技术援助、关税和稳定出口收入等方面对非加太国家给予优惠。前三个协定的援助金额分别为35亿、56.07亿和85亿欧洲货币单位。这些款项除一部分直接资助非加太国家的发展项目外，相当一部分专门用于稳定非加太国家初级产品的出口收入。
    诚然，这些措施对帮助非加太国家克服经济困难，减轻它们出口收入的损失起到了一定的作用。但是，由于稳定收入补贴总额不够，经常不能满足出口国申请补贴的要求。以1988年为例，非加太国家因咖啡和可可等热带作物产品价格暴跌，要求欧共体补贴5.79亿欧洲货币单位，但实际批准的只有3.75亿欧洲货币单位。再如，科特迪瓦1988年的出口收入损失为6000亿西非法郎，而得到的补贴只有400亿西非法郎。正是因为不合理的国际经济秩序，1980—1987年间，非加太国家的购买力下降了64％，南北之间的差距进一步扩大。
    鉴于前三个《洛美协定》并未阻止非加太国家的贫穷化，使其走上健康稳定的发展道路，这些第三世界国家对第4个《洛美协定》寄予厚望。他们曾要求欧共体增加财政援助，提高稳定出口收入的基金，希望对现有的稳定出口收入制度进行改革，放宽补偿的限制条件等。尽管此次协定的援助金额明显高于前三次，但是，由于非加太国家的上述合理要求未能得到认真的讨论和对待，有的甚至遭到断然拒绝，致使非加太国家普遍感到失望。
    科特迪瓦《博爱晨报》在一篇署名文章中指出，“欧共体和非加太国家的合作是彼此利益的结合，从签约起至今合作双方都从中得到了好处。现在的问题是非加太国家受到了损害。”塞内加尔商业部长呼吁说：“事情很清楚，欧共体是能够提出一项改革方案，以解除人们的忧虑的，这就要看它是否真正有诚意了。”（本报科特迪瓦12月18日电）
