The United Nations Special Representative to Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said today here that the process of Namibia's independence is "very successful," and that Namibia will declare independence from South African rule next March.

Ahtisaari just returned from Namibia and said that the Constituent Assembly of Namibia, elected last month under UN supervision, has "very successfully begun its work."

He said that the Constituent Assembly, composed of 72 members from 6 parties, is currently drafting a constitution and will soon decide the specific date of independence. He also said that everyone observing this process is optimistic, and he is also optimistic.

However, he added that due to Namibia's unique political conditions, some "conflicts" between the factions supporting independence and those supporting the South African authorities that have occurred in recent weeks may still occur in the future.

Namibia has been under South African occupation since the First World War.

    联合国驻纳米比亚特使说
    纳独立进程非常成功
    新华社联合国12月14日电  （记者雷力利）联合国驻纳米比亚特使阿赫蒂萨里今天在这里说，纳米比亚独立进程“非常成功”，纳将于明年3月宣布从南非统治下获得独立。
    阿赫蒂萨里刚从纳米比亚返回这里，他说，上个月在联合国监督下通过自由选举选出的纳米比亚制宪议会已“非常成功地开始工作”。
    他说，由6个政党的72名议员组成的制宪议会目前正在制订一部宪法，并将在近期内决定独立的具体日期。他还说，每个观察这一进程的人都很乐观，他也很乐观。
    然而他又说，由于纳米比亚特殊的政治条件，最近几周在支持独立和支持南非当局的派别之间发生的一些“冲突”在今后仍有可能发生。
    纳米比亚自第一次世界大战以来一直为南非所占领。
