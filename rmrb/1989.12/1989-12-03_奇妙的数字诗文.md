Numbers are often dry and uninteresting. Repeated readings can make them even more boring. However, if arranged skillfully by a poet and used appropriately, they can add charm and vitality to poetry and prose, transforming the mundane into the extraordinary, creating endless delight.

    One li away, two or three households,
    Four or five houses in the village,
    Six or seven pavilions,
    Eight or nine blooming flowers.

This twenty-character poem has numbers occupying half of it. Yet, it paints a captivating picture of a rural landscape.

In the late Qing Dynasty, a poor scholar from Chenzhou, Henan, was visiting a friend in the city. Passing by the city lake, he was inspired by the falling snowflakes and spontaneously composed a poem, "Snowfall Ode":

    One flake, two flakes, three or four flakes,
    Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten flakes,
    Thousands of flakes, tens of thousands of flakes, countless flakes,
    Flying into the reeds, they disappear without a trace.

In the Yuan Dynasty, Xu Zaishi wrote, "One leaf of the osmanthus, one autumn sound, one banana leaf, one sorrow." The poet used four "ones" in two lines to describe the autumn sounds, evoking a rich imagination and deep emotions, truly a masterpiece.

The most charming example is a four-line poem by a boatman describing a river scene:

    One raincoat, one hat, one boat,
    One bamboo pole, one hook,
    One mountain, one river, one moon,
    One person fishing alone in the autumn river.

Ten "ones" describe the fishing boat and the beautiful scenery on the river, making it lively, easy to remember, and enjoyable for all.

Another unique example is using numbers as riddles. For instance, the famous Song Dynasty poetess Zhu Shuzhen's "Broken Heart Riddle" is astonishing.

Zhu Shuzhen's husband was a greedy man who went away on business and never returned, instead finding a new lover. When the poetess learned of his remarriage, she realized that reunion was impossible, filled with grief and anger, and poured her sorrow into her poetry. Even on her deathbed, she wrote a bitter and resolute "Broken Heart Riddle." The riddle's text is long and sad, with ten sentences, each hinting at a number.

The full text of "Broken Heart Riddle" is:

    Coming down the stairs, money falls;
    Asking the sky, where is he?
    Hating the prince, he went straight away;
    Cursing the enemy, saying he won't return;
    Regretting the past, I made a mistake;
    Having friends above, not below;
    Black and white, why ask?
    Separating without a knife;
    From now on, do not rely on enemies;
    A thousand thoughts of love, all disappear!

The riddle's answer, in order, is "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten." It is written with deep sorrow and bitterness, seamless and flawless, truly a unique masterpiece in history. (October 28, 1989, Weekly Edition of the Farmer's Daily, by Zhang Zuohui)

### 奇妙的数字诗文

    奇妙的数字诗文
    数字往往是枯燥无味的，重读则便会兴味索然。如果经诗人巧妙安排，用得恰当，竟能给诗文增神添采，化平淡为神奇，妙趣横生，其乐无穷。
    一去二三里，烟村四五家，亭台六七座，八九十枝花。
    这首二十字的小诗，数字占了一半。然而勾勒出一幅令人心醉的山村风光画。
    清末，河南陈州有个穷秀才进城访友，路过城湖时，正置雪花飞扬。秀才诗兴大发，信口咏出一首《吟雪诗》：“一片二片三四片，五六七八九十片，千片万片无数片，飞入芦花总不现。”
    元代徐再思的“一声梧叶一声秋，一点芭蕉一点愁。”作者在两句诗里用了四个“一”字，以渲染秋声，烘托秋思，联想丰富，耐人寻味，真可谓独具匠心。
    最富有情趣的莫过于某艄公咏江景的一首四言诗了：“一蓑一笠一条舟，一枝竹竿一条钩，一山一水一明月，一人独钓一江秋”。十个“一”字，写出了鱼船及江中美景，爽朗明快，易记易唱，众皆喜闻乐见。
    别具一格的是，还有以数字作谜底的。如宋代著名才女朱淑真的《断肠谜》，便令人叫绝。
    朱淑真的丈夫是个重利轻别离的市侩，他出外经商，久居异乡而不归，并另求新欢。当才女得知他另娶的消息之后，知团圆无望，悲愤填膺，终日寄忧怨于诗词。直到她临死之前，还流着热泪，写下了一首愤懑决绝的《断肠谜》。其谜面文长意哀，有十个分句，每个分句打一个数字。
    《断肠谜》的谜面全文是：
    下楼来，金钱卜落；问苍天，人在何方？恨王孙，一直去了；詈冤家，言去不回；悔当初，吾错失口；有上交，无下交；皂白何须问；分开不用刀；从今莫把仇人靠；千种相思一撤消！
    《断肠谜》的谜底，依次是“一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九、十”10个数字；写得悲愤凄绝，首尾一气，浑成佳词，真是千古独绝。（10月28日《农民日报》周末版　张作会文）
