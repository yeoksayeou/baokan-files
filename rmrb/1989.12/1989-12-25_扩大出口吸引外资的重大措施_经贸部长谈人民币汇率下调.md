	Major Measures to Expand Exports and Attract Foreign Investment
	Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on the Adjustment of the RMB Exchange Rate

	People's Daily, Beijing, December 24 — Reporters Lù Zhènhuá of People's Daily and Zhāng Yì of Xinhua News Agency report: What impact will the adjustment of the RMB exchange rate have on China's foreign economic and trade activities? Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Zhèng Tuóbiǎn believes that the adjustment of the RMB exchange rate is a major reform measure taken by China to promote stable economic growth and expand foreign trade exports, which will have a positive impact on China's foreign economic and trade cooperation and technological exchanges.

	Zhèng Tuóbiǎn said to reporters yesterday, "The state has decided to significantly adjust the RMB exchange rate, gradually aligning the purchasing power of the RMB with foreign exchange. This will facilitate the further integration of China's economy with the global economy and is a major measure to deepen reforms. This measure enhances the competitiveness of China's export goods in the international market, which is beneficial for expanding exports. At the same time, it strongly promotes the development of domestic export goods production, and will have a positive effect on further expanding opening up and attracting foreign investment. With the increase in export earnings, it provides a strong guarantee for China to repay foreign debts."

	Zhèng Tuóbiǎn urged all levels of foreign trade and economic departments and foreign trade enterprises to correctly use the favorable conditions brought by the exchange rate adjustment to expand exports and prevent the purchase price of export goods from rising with the exchange rate adjustment. The purchase price of export goods should be strictly determined according to the principle of the same price for the same quality and better price for better quality, and should not be arbitrarily increased.

	Zhèng Tuóbiǎn pointed out that for import contracts that have already been signed, as well as foreign debts that need to be repaid, the contracts or repayment agreements must be fulfilled on time.

	It is understood that some overseas economists believe that the adjustment of the RMB exchange rate not only indicates that China's leaders have not abandoned economic reforms, but also means that the Chinese government is confident in controlling inflation.

    扩大出口吸引外资的重大措施
    经贸部长谈人民币汇率下调
    本报北京12月24日讯　本报记者陆振华、新华社记者张毅报道：人民币汇率下调对我国对外经济贸易将产生什么影响？经贸部部长郑拓彬认为，人民币汇率下调是我国为促进国民经济稳定增长和扩大外贸出口所采取的一项重大改革措施，将对我国的对外经济贸易与技术合作产生积极影响。
    郑拓彬昨日对记者说，国家决定较大幅度调整人民币汇率，使人民币与外汇的购买力逐步接近，有利于促进我国经济与世界经济的进一步联系，是深化改革的一项重大措施。这一措施增强了我国出口商品在国际市场上的竞争能力，有利于扩大出口，同时也有力地促进了国内出口商品生产的发展，对进一步扩大对外开放和吸收外商投资也将产生积极的促进作用。随着出口创汇的增加，为我国偿还外债提供了有力的保证。
    郑拓彬要求各级经贸部门和外贸企业，正确运用汇率调整所带来的有利条件，扩大出口，防止出现出口商品收购价格随着汇率调整而上升。出口商品收购价格要严格按照与内销商品同质同价、优质优价的原则确定，不得随意加价。
    郑拓彬指出，对已经签订的进口合同，以及应偿还的外债本息，必须按期履行合同或偿债协议。
    据了解，海外一些经济界人士认为，人民币汇率下调，不仅表明中国领导人并没有放弃经济改革，同时意味着中国政府对控制通货膨胀充满信心。
