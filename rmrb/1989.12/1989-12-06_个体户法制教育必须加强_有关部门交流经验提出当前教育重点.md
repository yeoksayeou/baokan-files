Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 5th.

In the process of rectification and regulation, to ensure the healthy development of China's individual economy, it is essential to strengthen legal education for individual business households and gradually bring individual economy under the rule of law. This was the consensus reached by representatives at the national conference on the experience of individual business households learning and applying the law, jointly organized by the Ministry of Justice and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce in Zhengzhou.

The reporter learned from today's concluding meeting that by the end of June this year, the number of individual businesses in urban and rural areas nationwide had reached over 12.3 million, with nearly 20 million people engaged in this sector. In the first half of the year, the industrial output value of individual businesses nationwide was 29.3 billion yuan, accounting for 4.59% of the national industrial output value. From the experiences shared by various regions at the conference, it is evident that this large contingent of individual business households has undergone significant changes under the collective efforts of all parties, and the overall trend is positive. However, it is also necessary to acknowledge the negative aspects of the individual economy, the most prominent of which is that a small number of individual business households are still engaged in illegal business activities, causing public dissatisfaction.

The conference believed that, given the unique characteristics of the individual economy's industries and workforce, strengthening legal education and regulatory measures is crucial: First, to help them voluntarily comply with the law and become law-abiding citizens and socialist individual laborers who conduct law-abiding business operations; second, to enable them to learn how to use the law as a weapon to combat illegal activities. The current priorities should be: strengthening tax law education; strengthening education on lawful business operations; and strengthening education on lawful "anti-pornography" efforts. Through legal education and learning, lawful business operations, individual business households should be encouraged to establish a good image in areas such as fair trade, genuine products, courteous service, lawful tax payments, and honest labor to achieve prosperity.

The conference also emphasized that all administrative law enforcement departments and their law enforcement personnel must take the lead in learning the law, advocating for the law, and acting in accordance with the law. They must protect the lawful rights and interests of individual business households, strictly prohibit arbitrary levies, fees, seizures, and fines, and genuinely promote their own integrity building.

    个体户法制教育必须加强
    有关部门交流经验提出当前教育重点
    本报郑州12月5日电　记者李而亮报道：在治理整顿中，要使我国个体经济得以健康发展，必须努力加强对个体工商户的法制教育，逐步把个体经济纳入法制轨道。这是司法部、国家工商局联合在郑州召开的全国个体工商户学法用法的经验交流会上，与会代表的共识。
    记者从今天结束的这次会议上获悉，到今年6月底，全国城乡个体工商业已发展到1230万多户，从业人员近2000万人，上半年全国个体工商业工业产值293亿元，占全国工业产值的4.59％。从会议交流的各地经验看，个体工商户这支庞大的队伍在各方齐抓共管下已经起了很大的变化，主流是好的。但也不应回避个体经济存在的消极因素，最明显的是仍有少数个体工商户从事非法经营活动，引起群众的不满。
    会议认为：针对个体经济行业、队伍的特殊性，强化法律教育、制约措施很重要：一要帮助他们自觉守法，做守法公民和守法经营的社会主义个体劳动者；二要使他们学会用法，以法律为武器同违法行为作斗争。当前要抓好的重点是，加强税法教育；加强依法经营教育；加强依法“扫黄”的教育。要通过普法学法，依法经营，促使个体工商户在公平买卖、货真价实、礼貌待客、依法纳税、依法律己、靠诚实劳动致富等方面树立自身良好形象。
    会议同时强调，各行政执法部门及其执法人员，要带头学法、讲法、依法办事、依法管理，依法保护个体户的合法权益，严禁乱摊派、乱收费、乱没收、乱罚款，切实搞好自身的廉政建设。
