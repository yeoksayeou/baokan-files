    Successful Trial Extraction at Yunnan Jinggu Oilfield

    KUNMING, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Recently, the No. 45 well in the Jinggu Dai and Yi Autonomous County oilfield in Yunnan Province successfully extracted oil, with an oil column height of over 10 meters. This marks the first time that oil has been extracted in Yunnan. The region was found to have oil and natural gas reserves in an area of 93 square kilometers in the 1970s. Trial extraction began in May this year, and success was achieved in November. Experimental analysis shows that the well can produce about 40 percent light oil. In addition, the petroleum sector is currently conducting intensive oil exploration in the Chuxiong Basin of Yunnan.

    本报昆明12月14日电　记者钱江报道：最近云南景谷傣族彝族自治县油田浅45号井经试采出油，油柱高10余米，从而填补了云南无石油开采的空白。该地区在70年代就已探明在93平方公里的范围内有石油和天然气储量，今年5月着手试采，终于在11月获得成功。经试验分析，该油井可出轻质油40％左右。此外，石油部门正在云南楚雄盆地进行紧张的石油钻探工作。
