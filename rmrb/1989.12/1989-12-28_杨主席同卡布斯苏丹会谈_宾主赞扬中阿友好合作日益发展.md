Chairman Yang Meets with Sultan Qaboos
Host and Guest Praise the Growing Friendship and Cooperation Between China and Oman

MUSCAT, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) — Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Sultan Qaboos of Oman in a small-scale meeting at the Al-Alam Palace this morning. The meeting was held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere. The two leaders exchanged views on enhancing friendship and cooperation between the two countries and on major international issues, particularly the situation in the Gulf and the Middle East problem, and reached broad consensus.

Chairman Yang said that although China and Oman are far apart, historically, the two peoples have established friendly exchanges through the maritime Silk Road. In 1980, the Omani replica ship "Suhar" sailed along the ancient route to reach Guangzhou, China, writing a new chapter in the friendship between the two peoples.

Chairman Yang emphasized that since the establishment of diplomatic relations, friendship and cooperation between China and Oman have made significant progress. We are willing to work with our Omani friends to further enhance multi-level friendly cooperation between the two countries.

After reaffirming China's stance on the Gulf situation and the Middle East issue, Chairman Yang pointed out that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the increasingly important role played by the Gulf Cooperation Council in international and regional affairs. He congratulated the 10th Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council on its successful conclusion and Sultan Qaboos on his chairmanship of this summit. He said that we have always believed that the affairs of the Gulf region should be decided by the countries in the region. We are genuinely pleased to see the six Gulf countries strengthening their unity, cooperation, and common development.

Sultan Qaboos praised the satisfactory development of relations between Oman and China in recent years. He hopes that the two countries will further strengthen friendly cooperation for the benefit of the two peoples. When discussing the Gulf situation, Sultan Qaboos said that as a permanent member of the Security Council, China has played an important role in promoting the reconciliation between Iran and Iraq, both during the Iran-Iraq War and after the ceasefire. He hopes that China will continue to contribute to the peace and stability of the Gulf region.

Chairman Yang reiterated the invitation for Sultan Qaboos to visit China. Sultan Qaboos happily accepted the invitation and expressed his intention to visit at a convenient time.

In other news, Sultan Qaboos of Oman held a banquet at the Al-Alam Palace on the evening of the 26th to welcome Chairman Yang's official friendly visit to the Sultanate of Oman.
