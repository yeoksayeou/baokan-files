Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Government Establish Systems to Strengthen Ideological and Political Work in Schools

    BEIJING, Nov. 30 -- Reporter Xiao Guan Gen reports: Today, the reporter learned from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Government's meeting on ideological and political work in schools that the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee focuses on stability and emphasizes motivation. It will strengthen the Party's leadership in ideological and political work in schools to ensure the cultivation of successors for socialist undertakings.

    The Municipal Party Committee and Government have decided to establish the following systems:

    First, each member of the Municipal Party Committee and Deputy Mayor will be responsible for two universities, institutionalizing and regularizing the practice of municipal leaders being fixedly connected with schools. Through discussions, investigations, and research, they will understand and guide school work, helping schools solve some practical difficulties.

    Second, the Municipal Party Committee will hold a standing committee meeting at least every half year to specifically analyze and study school work, especially ideological and political work in schools.

    Third, establish a "bimonthly joint meeting" system led by the Municipal Party Committee's secretary in charge, with members of the Municipal Education Leading Group and major responsible persons from the Municipal Propaganda Department, Municipal Education and Health Party Committee, and Municipal Youth League Committee, to coordinate and plan ideological and political work in schools.

    Fourth, establish a system for regularly giving situation and political reports to school party and administrative leaders, political work cadres, and political theory teachers.

    Fifth, the Municipal Party School, district and county party schools, education and health party schools, and other large party schools should undertake or actively support the political training of party cadres and political theory teachers at all levels and types of schools.

    Sixth, the Municipal Party Committee requires that all departmental party organizations should care for and support school ideological and political work and strengthen supervision and inspection. Entrust the Municipal Education and Health Party Committee to lead and guide ideological and political work in all levels and types of schools across the city.

    The Municipal Party Committee emphasizes the need to fully play the political core role of party organizations at all levels and types of schools. Universities generally need to establish student ideological and political work groups or guidance committees under the leadership of the Party Committee. Currently, it is necessary to quickly fill and stabilize the first-line full-time student political work cadres. Select a group of outstanding comrades from teachers and management cadres to strengthen this team. Select cadres with strong party spirit, high Marxism-Leninism theoretical level, and party work experience to strengthen and improve the party leadership teams at the school and department levels. Select politically mature comrades with some ideological and political work experience to serve as party branch or party committee secretaries.

    The theme of the Shanghai Municipal Schools' Ideological and Political Work Conference is to study how to adhere to a firm and correct political direction, strengthen and improve school ideological and political work, and truly make schools a stronghold for cultivating successors for socialist undertakings. To hold this conference well, Municipal Party Committee Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji and other responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee, Government, and Municipal People's Congress visited 36 schools and held dozens of symposiums. More than 600 teachers, staff, and student representatives participated in the symposiums.

    着眼稳定　着力鼓劲　培养社会主义事业接班人
    上海市委市府建立制度  加强学校思想政治工作
    本报上海11月30日电　记者萧关根报道：记者今天从上海市委、市政府召开的上海市学校思想政治工作会议上了解到，上海市委着眼于稳定，着力于鼓劲，切实加强党对学校思想政治工作的领导，以期把培养社会主义事业接班人的大事落到实处。
    市委、市政府决定建立如下工作制度：
    第一，市委党委、副市长每人联系两所大学，把市领导固定联系学校的做法进一步制度化、经常化，通过座谈对话、调查研究，了解、指导学校工作，帮助学校解决一些实际困难。
    第二，市委至少每半年召开一次常委会，专题分析研究学校工作，尤其是学校思想政治工作。
    第三，建立由市委分管书记牵头，并有市教育领导小组成员和市委宣传部、市教卫党委、团市委等部门主要负责人参加的“双月联席会议”制度，协调和规划学校思想政治工作。
    第四，建立定期对学校党政领导、政工干部和政治理论课教师作形势政治报告的制度。
    第五，市委党校、区县委党校、教卫党校以及其他大口党校要切实承担或积极支持对各级各类学校党的干部和政治理论课教师的政治培训任务。
    第六，市委要求各部门的党组织都要关心和支持学校思想政治工作，并加强督促检查。委托市教卫党委加强对全市各级各类学校思想政治工作进行领导和指导。
    市委强调要充分发挥各级各类学校党组织的政治核心作用。高校一般都要成立在党委领导下的学生思想政治工作小组或指导委员会。当前，要尽快配齐和稳定第一线的专职学生政工干部。从教师和管理干部中抽调一批优秀的同志充实这支队伍。选拔党性强、有较高马列主义理论素养和党的工作经验的干部，充实和加强校系两级党的领导班子。挑选政治上比较成熟，又有一定思想政治工作经验的同志担任党总支或支部书记。
    上海市学校思想政治工作会议的主题是研究如何坚持坚定正确的政治方向，切实加强和改进学校思想政治工作，把学校真正办成培养社会主义事业接班人的坚强阵地。为开好这次会议，市委书记、市长朱熔基和市委、市政府、市人大其他负责同志分头深入36所学校，召开了几十个座谈会，有600多名教职工和学生代表参加座谈。
