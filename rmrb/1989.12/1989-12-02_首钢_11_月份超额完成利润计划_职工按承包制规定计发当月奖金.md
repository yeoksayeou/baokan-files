Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 2nd.

Capital Steel Corporation (Shougang) did not meet its self-imposed monthly plan of achieving a 20% increase in profit over the previous year in October, resulting in no bonuses for all employees. However, in November, the enthusiasm of the workers not only did not wane but instead surged. The company realized a profit of 1.73 billion yuan, not only completing the monthly plan but also making up for the over 100 million yuan shortfall from October.

Premier Li Peng paid close attention to Shougang's failure to meet the monthly plan in October and wrote on the company's report: "Comrade Guanwu: I hope that, based on a thorough summary of the experience, you will lead all the employees of the company to continue moving forward." The workers were greatly inspired.

From the production frontlines to the logistics support systems, from the workers to their families, everyone took action. During this period, various factories and mines set 92 new records for output per shift and output per day.

In November, Shougang exceeded the profit plan, and bonuses for the month will be issued according to the contract system.

    职工按承包制规定计发当月奖金
    本报讯　首都钢铁公司10月份由于没有完成自己制定的按实现利润比上年增长20％的月计划，全体职工没有拿到奖金。11月份，广大工作者劳动热情不但没有下降，反而更加高涨，实现利润达到1.73亿元，不仅完成了当月计划，还弥补了10月份比计划亏欠的1000多万元。
    对首钢10月份没有完成月计划，李鹏总理非常重视，在首钢简报上批示：“冠五同志：希望在认真总结经验的基础上，率领全公司职工继续前进。”职工受到很大鼓舞。
    从生产第一线到后勤服务系统，从职工到家属，上上下下都行动起来了。这期间各厂矿共创出班产、日产新纪录92次。
    11月份首钢超额完成了利润计划，将按承包制规定计发当月的奖金。
