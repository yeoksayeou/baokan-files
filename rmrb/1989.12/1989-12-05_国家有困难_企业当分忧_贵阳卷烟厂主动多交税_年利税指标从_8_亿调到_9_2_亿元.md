To achieve this goal, the factory focused on several aspects: adjusting the product structure according to market demand, exploring every possible way to tap into potential, and expanding the production of high-grade filtered cigarettes; strengthening management, improving the economic responsibility system, and implementing the "Comprehensive Target Economic Responsibility System" assessment throughout the factory, breaking down production and operation targets to departments and even individual workers; expanding the market, and focusing on sales. To this end, the factory organized sales personnel to explore external markets, organize shipments, and improve joint ventures. Statistics show that from September to October, the factory achieved sales revenue of 248 million yuan, submitted 214 million yuan to the state treasury, setting a historical high.
