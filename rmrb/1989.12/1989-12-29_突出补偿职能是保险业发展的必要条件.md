The People's Insurance Industry in China has gone through a 40-year journey marked by both twists and turns and glory. During this period, there have been many experiences and lessons that need to be carefully summarized. With the development of socialist construction and reform, we need to conduct more in-depth research on the nature, status, functions, and development direction of our socialist insurance industry, as well as related policy issues. This will make our work more in line with its development laws and more conducive to the needs of the country's economy and people's lives for insurance.

In the past decade, China's People's Insurance Industry has made significant progress, but there are still some problems. Among these, the issue of overly emphasizing the insurance industry's role in accumulating funds is particularly worth studying.

The People's Insurance Industry, with the financial backing of the state, has a certain inevitability in its early development. The nature of the insurance industry requires it to first raise a relatively large amount of capital as start-up funds. Additionally, the unpredictability of risk losses and the limited financial strength of the insurance industry make it necessary for the insurance industry to rely on state financial support to exist and develop. However, this type of insurance, which relies on state financial support, inevitably has a drawback: it inappropriately strengthens the insurance industry's role in accumulating funds, as if the primary function of insurance is to accumulate funds to serve the state finances. Especially after the completion of the socialist transformation of ownership of the means of production, the degree of nationalization of social funds has greatly increased, and the role of insurance in accumulating funds is seen as an unnecessary "reversal of the pocket." This is likely the fundamental reason why the insurance industry was suspended for more than twenty years.

The fundamental function of the insurance industry does not lie in accumulating funds but in dispersing risks and organizing economic compensation. Building the insurance industry on this basis can fully utilize the social functions of insurance and make insurance demonstrate its irreplaceable characteristics. Regarding the necessity of establishing insurance funds in society, Marx has discussions in works such as "Capital." He said:

"In the process of reproduction, from the material aspect, it is always in various accidental and dangerous situations that will destroy part of it.... Therefore, part of the profit, that is, part of the surplus value and surplus product (from the value aspect, only the newly added labor is embodied in it), must function as an insurance fund.... In income, only this part is neither consumed as income nor necessarily used as an accumulation fund.... Even after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, this part must continue to exist." (Capital, Volume 3, Page 995)

It is easy to understand that establishing insurance funds is a means for humanity to fight against various misfortunes and natural disasters, aiming to maintain the continuous and stable progress of social reproduction. Misfortunes and natural disasters will not disappear with the change of social forms, so whether it is a capitalist society or a socialist society, establishing insurance funds is equally necessary. Moreover, this "necessary deduction" should neither be used for consumption nor be regarded as a general accumulation fund to be arbitrarily used for expanded reproduction.

There are various forms of reserve funds used to deal with misfortunes and natural disasters, such as personal and family savings, reserve funds set aside by enterprises, special funds set aside by the state for disaster relief and assistance, and insurance funds managed by insurance companies. Because insurance funds come from the premiums paid by tens of thousands of different policyholders, because the determination of insurance premium rates is based on statistical and computational foundations established on the "law of large numbers," and because insurance economic compensation is strictly carried out according to the insurance contracts signed between the insurer and the insured, therefore, it has more obvious advantages in terms of the diversity of the insured objects, the breadth of the insured scope, the speed of insurance, and the reliability of economic compensation. After 40 years of construction, China's economic strength has greatly increased, and education, science, and culture have made considerable progress. Currently, China is in the primary stage of socialism, with a large population, a weak foundation, and per capita national income still lagging behind in the world. A portion of modern industry coexists with a large number of backward industries, and a portion of economically developed regions coexists with vast underdeveloped and impoverished regions. In the process of economic reform, we have expanded the autonomy of enterprises, implemented various forms of management responsibility systems, and developed various forms of ownership under the premise of a public ownership economy. We have established various economic zones, making the national economy present a complex and diverse situation of "diversified economic forms, diversified economic interests, autonomous enterprise operations, and decentralized micro-decision-making." Faced with this situation, the original method suitable for a product economy and a single ownership system, that is, "the state covers all risks and the state bears all losses," is no longer able to cover and bear in many aspects, revealing the defects of narrow coverage and low coverage levels. However, the insurance industry, which is based on contracts and operates on the principle of "equal rights and obligations," can adapt to changes and be flexible, thus developing rapidly. Taking the insurance industry in Beijing as an example, since its resumption ten years ago, the types of insurance it has underwritten have increased from the initial single "enterprise property insurance" to 156 types. Annual business income has surged from over 20 million yuan to 400 million yuan, and the property and liability risks it has undertaken for society have exceeded 100 billion yuan. It has initially formed an insurance business network that covers both urban and rural areas in Beijing and extends overseas. It demonstrates from one aspect the thriving scene of the People's Insurance Industry and, to a certain extent, explains that the economic compensation method of the insurance industry, as a stabilizer for social reproduction and people's lives, basically meets the requirements of the primary stage of socialism for developing productive forces and planned commodity economy, meets the requirements of enterprises and commodity producers to disperse disaster risks and operational risks in the reform situation, and meets the requirements of the broad masses of people who are gradually becoming prosperous to improve the level of property and personal insurance. This is the decisive factor for the rapid development of the insurance industry.

The insurance industry has a broad market and great potential. However, to develop an insurance system suitable for China's national conditions and fully play the role of a "social stabilizer," we need to adjust the current policies, gradually weaken the role of accumulating funds that has been taken pride in for many years, and truly place the economic compensation function in the first position. As a service-oriented tertiary industry, insurance should first do a good job of serving society, strengthen risk management, and increase the stability of social reproduction and people's lives, thereby also increasing the stability of national fiscal balance. This adjustment requires the state to provide some policy support, that is, to gradually reduce the tax rate on the insurance industry, appropriately increase the accumulation level of the total reserve fund, and truly be able to independently bear various risks. Currently, the state regards the current year's premium surplus of insurance companies as "profit," and the cumulative tax rate is relatively high, which weakens the social function of insurance. At the same time, imposing high taxes on insurance will inevitably reduce the insurance fund and expand the accumulation fund, which will weaken the stability of social production and national finances, and from a long-term perspective, it is not beneficial to the national finances. Therefore, the state gradually reducing the insurance tax rate is not only a necessary condition for insurance companies to enhance their compensation ability but also a necessary condition for the insurance industry to achieve greater development, establish a socialist insurance system, and take on greater responsibilities for the country.

    突出补偿职能是保险业发展的必要条件
    王玉泉
    中国人民保险事业走过了40年曲折而又光荣的历程，在这期间，有很多经验教训需要认真总结。随着社会主义建设与改革的发展，对我国社会主义保险事业的性质、地位、职能、发展方向，以及相关的政策问题，要进行更深入的研究，使我们的工作更符合其发展规律，更有利于国家经济和人民生活对保险的需要。
    近十年来，我国的人民保险事业有了很大发展，但还存在一些问题，其中主要是片面强调保险的聚财作用问题值得研究。
    人民保险事业以财政为后盾，在其发展初期有一定的必然性。因为保险行业的特点决定了它首先需要筹措数额相对巨大的资金作为资本金，加之风险损失难以预料，保险资金力量单薄，使得保险事业必须得到财政支持才能存在和发展。但是，这种以财政为依托的保险也不可避免地存在一个弊病，就是不恰当地强化了保险的聚财作用，似乎保险的主要职能是积聚资金为财政服务。特别是生产资料所有制的社会主义改造完成后，社会资金国有化程度大大提高，保险聚财的作用被视为不必要的“倒口袋”，这恐怕是保险事业被停办二十多年的根本原因。
    保险事业本身的基本职能，不在于聚财，而在于分散风险和组织经济补偿。把保险事业建立在这样一个基点上，才能充分发挥保险的社会功能，也才能使保险显示出其不可替代的特性。关于社会建立保险基金的必要性，马克思在《资本论》等著作中都有论述。他说：
  “在再生产过程中，从物质方面看，总是处在各种会把它的一部分破坏的意外和危险中。……因此，利润的一部分，也就是，剩余价值从而剩余产品（从价值方面看，只有新加的劳动在其中体现）的一部分，必须当作保险基金来发生作用……在收入中，也只有这个部分，既不当作收入被消费，也不一定当作积累基金来发生作用……也只有这个部分，甚至在资本主义生产方式废止之后，也必须继续存在下去。”（《资本论》第3卷，第995页）不难理解，社会建立保险基金是人类同各种不幸事故和自然灾害进行斗争的一种手段，为的是维持社会再生产的持续稳定进行。不幸事故和自然灾害不会因社会形态的改变而消失，因而不论是资本主义社会，还是社会主义社会，建立保险基金都同样是必要的。而且这种“必要的扣除”，既不能用于消费，也不应视同于一般意义上的积累基金而任意用于扩大再生产。
    用来应付不幸事故和自然灾害的后备基金有多种存在形式，如个人和家庭的储蓄，企业提存的后备基金，国家财政用于救灾、救济的专项基金，由保险公司管理的保险基金，等等。由于保险基金来源于成千上万的各种投保人所交纳的保险费，由于保险费率的厘定建立在依据“大数法则”的统计和计算的基础上，由于保险的经济补偿严格按照保险人和被保险人签订的保险合同来进行，因此它在保障对象的多样性、保障范围的广泛性、保障时效的迅速性和经济补偿的可靠性等方面具有更为明显的优势。我国经过40年的建设，经济实力有了巨大增长，教育科学文化事业有了相当发展。当前我国正处在社会主义初级阶段，人口多，底子薄，人均国民生产总值仍居于世界后列，一部分现代化工业同大量落后工业同时存在，一部分经济比较发达地区同广大不发达地区、贫困地区同时存在。在经济改革中，我们扩大了企业的自主权，实行多种形式的经营责任制以及在公有制为主体的前提下发展多种所有制经济，建立了各种经济特区，使国民经济呈现出“经济形式多样化、经济利益多元化、企业经营自主化、微观决策分散化”的复杂纷纭的局面。面对这种形势，原来那种适合产品经济和单一所有制的办法，即“一切风险由国家兜起来，一切损失由国家包下来”的办法，在很多方面已经兜不住、包不了，显露出保障面窄和保障水平低的缺陷。而建立在契约基础上、实行“权利、义务对等”原则的保险事业，却能随高就低，灵活应变，因此得到迅速的发展。以北京的保险事业而言，重新恢复十年来，承保的险种由最初单一的“企业财产险”增加到156种，年业务收入由2000多万元猛增到4亿元，为社会承担的财产及责任风险超过1000亿元，初步形成了遍及北京城乡并扩展到海外的保险业务网络。它从一个侧面展示了人民保险事业欣欣向荣的景象，并在一定程度上说明了以保险业的经济补偿方式作为社会再生产和人民生活的稳定器，基本上适应社会主义初级阶段发展生产力和有计划的商品经济的要求，适应改革形势下企业及商品生产者分散灾害风险和经营风险的要求，适应逐步富裕起来的广大群众对提高家财、人身的保障水平的要求，这是保险事业得以迅速发展的决定因素。
    保险事业市场广阔，潜力很大。但要发展成适合我国国情的保险体系，充分发挥“社会稳定器”的功能，还应当对现行的政策进行调整，逐步弱化若干年来一直引为骄傲的聚财作用，而把经济补偿职能真正摆到首位。保险作为服务性的第三产业，首先应该搞好对社会的服务，加强风险管理，为社会再生产和人民生活增加稳定性，进而也为国家财政平衡增加稳定性。这种调整，需要国家在政策上给予一定的支持，也就是要逐步降低对保险事业征税的幅度，适当提高保险总准备金的积累水平，使之真正能够独立承担各种风险。当前国家把保险公司的当年保费节余视为“利润”，累计征税幅度较高，结果削弱了保险的社会功能。同时，对保险课以高税，必然是缩小保险基金而扩大积累基金，这就会削弱社会生产和国家财政的稳定性，从长远利益上看，对国家财政也是不利的。所以，国家逐步降低保险税率，不仅是保险公司增强偿付能力的必要条件，也是保险事业获得更大发展，建立起社会主义保险体系，为国家承担更大责任的必要条件。
