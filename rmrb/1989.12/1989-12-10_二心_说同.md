Title: On the Unity of the "Two Hearts"

Currently, some enterprise leaders are confused about the so-called "two hearts" theory.

The _Enterprise Law_ stipulates that the factory director is in the "central position" within the enterprise; currently, it is also emphasized that the party organization within the enterprise should play a "political core" role. Some people notice that there are two "heart" characters on the surface, one "center" and one "core," and then they start to scrutinize the words, wondering whether it is the "center" leading the "core" or the "core" leading the "center." Thus, the so-called "two hearts" theory arises.

The author once sought advice from a party secretary of a state-owned cotton mill. He did not directly answer but only told about the actual situation in their factory: In recent years, their ideological and political work, although also subject to some interference, has been consistently carried out and developed. After establishing the central position of the factory director, the director clearly proposed that ideological and political work should not be weakened but strengthened; the party committee also believed that the director's responsibility system did not weaken their responsibility for ideological and political work. The director allocated necessary positions for political workers in the organizational structure, and the party committee insisted on conducting political training for administrative cadres. As a result, "two skins" became one skin, and small political work became big political work.

From this, it can be seen that for a system or a proposition, the primary issue is to truly understand its spirit and essence, rather than to detach from reality and scrutinize the words. Why propose the central position of the factory director? This is mainly aimed at the past situation where the enterprise was "everyone responsible" but actually no one was responsible, and it is also proposed to meet the requirements of modernized production and enterprise management for unified command. Why propose the "political core" role of the party committee? This is to strengthen the leadership role of the party, the role of the grassroots party organization as a fortress, and the role of party members as vanguards and models. These are proposals from two different angles. If understood in essence, we will see that the two are not only not contradictory or canceling each other out, but are complementary and integrated. If the factory director can truly play the central role and function, can he do without the support of the party organization's political core role? The party organization plays the core role precisely to ensure that the factory director leads the enterprise to run smoothly and correctly from the ideological and political aspects. From this perspective, the two hearts are actually one heart.

"But—don't the specific responsibilities of the factory director and the party secretary need to be clearly defined?" The author believes that first, if the essence of "center" and "core" is correctly understood, their responsibility scopes have already been clearly defined in principle. Second, the specific division of labor and relevant regulations for each enterprise need to be based on reality, continuously summarize experience, and continuously improve. It is neither possible nor necessarily beneficial to require the central authorities to regulate every detail.

The author also believes that how to understand and handle the relationship between the "two hearts" is also related to the quality of the enterprise leaders. If the factory director and the party secretary are both considerate of the overall situation, tolerant of each other, and have a high sense of responsibility for the party's cause, they will not quarrel over whose "heart" is bigger, but will become a pair of inseparable "reds" or "good brothers." If one is overly concerned with one's own power and position, then even with the most detailed specific regulations, the relationship between the two will be difficult to handle well. Many examples can prove this point.

The Changling Refinery and Chemical Plant, which won the national outstanding ideological and political work enterprise title, has the following understanding of the relationship between the factory director and the party secretary: "Responsibilities are divided, but thoughts are united; work is divided, but goals are united; systems are divided, but relationships are united." This can serve as a concise summary of this article on the unity of the "two hearts."

    “二心”说同
    辛言
    眼下，有些企业的领导者，对所谓“二心说”感到困惑。
    《企业法》规定，厂长在企业处于“中心地位”；目前又强调党组织在企业应发挥“政治核心”作用。一些人看出字面上有两个“心”字，一个“中心”，一个“核心”，便下劲地抠起字眼儿，究竟是“中心”领导“核心”，还是“核心”领导“中心”？于是引出来一个所谓“二心说”。
    笔者曾就此求教一位国营棉纺厂党委书记。他没有直接回答，只是告诉了他们厂子的实际情况：这几年，他们那里的思想政治工作，虽也受到一些干扰，但一直得到坚持和发展。确立厂长中心地位后，厂长明确提出，思想政治工作不能削弱，只能加强；党委也认为，厂长负责制并没有减弱自己的思想政治工作责任。厂长在编制上给予政工人员必要的位置，党委也坚持对行政干部进行政治培训。结果，“两张皮”变成一张皮，小政工变成了大政工。
    由此看来，对一项制度，一个提法，首要的问题是真正理解它的精神实质，而不能离开现实去死抠字眼儿。为什么提出厂长的中心地位？这主要是针对过去企业“人人负责”实际无人负责的状况提出来的，也是适应现代化生产和企业经营需要统一指挥的要求提出来的。为什么提出党委的“政治核心”作用？这是为加强党的领导作用、基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用以及党员的先锋模范作用提出来的。这是从两个不同角度提出来的说法。如果从实质上加以理解，我们就会看出，这两者不仅不是互相抵触，互相取消，而且是互相补充，互相结合的。厂长如果真能发挥中心地位和作用，离得开党组织政治核心作用的支持吗？党组织发挥核心作用不正是为了从思想政治方面保证厂长顺利而正确地领导企业运行吗？由此看，二心实乃同心。
    “那——厂长、书记的具体职责总得划分清楚啊！”笔者认为，第一，如果从实质上正确理解“中心”和“核心”的话，它们已经从原则上把两者的职责范围划清楚了。第二，每个企业的具体分工和有关规定，则需要从实际出发，不断总结经验，不断加以完善。要求中央把每个细节都规定得详详细细，既不可能，也未见得有益。
    笔者还认为，如何理解和处理“二心”之间的关系，与企业领导者本人的素质也是分不开的。如果厂长、书记都是顾全大局、互谅互让而又对党的事业有高度责任心的人，那他们决不会去争什么是你这个“心”大，还是我这个“心”大，而会成为谁也离不开谁的“一对红”、“哥俩好”。如果是过分计较自己的权力、地位，那么即使有再详细的具体规定，两者的关系也很难处理得好。有许多事例可以证明这个道理。
    获得全国思想政治工作优秀企业称号的长岭炼油化工厂这样认识厂长和书记之间的关系：“职责上分，思想上合；工作上分，目标上合；制度上分，关系上合。”这可以作为此篇“二心”说同的精辟总结。
