	Stopping Land Rights Violations Must Be Enforced
	Li Shusen
	Suizhou City Land Management Bureau, Hubei Province

	In recent years, with the development of urban and rural economic construction and the improvement of villagers' (residents') living conditions, the demand for land has been increasing. At the same time, there have been instances of not adhering to land management regulations and violations of land rights. From the situation in Suizhou City, the main phenomena are as follows:

	Some enterprises and units emphasize production needs and arbitrarily infringe upon collective land ownership; some state-owned units sell state-owned land ownership and usage rights; some state officials arbitrarily occupy state-owned and collective land to build private houses; some village committees infringe upon state-owned land ownership and usage rights; some villagers arbitrarily buy and sell collective land ownership and usage rights.

	The causes of land rights violations are multifaceted, mainly the following two points: First, there is a lack of understanding of the characteristics of land ownership and usage rights separation in China's current stage. In urban areas, some residents mistakenly believe that the current urban land still belongs to private individuals, leading to disputes over land use; in rural areas, with the implementation of the agricultural production responsibility system, land is contracted to households, and some villagers mistakenly believe that collectively owned land belongs to individuals, thinking they can do whatever they want with it. Second, some cadres have weak concepts of land policy, legal awareness, and overall perspective, do not respect the legal rights of state-owned and collective land owners, and often use administrative means, "using power instead of law" and "using emotions instead of law," leading to the occurrence of rights violations.

	To effectively prevent land rights violations, I believe that in addition to strengthening education, the most important work is to strengthen land supervision. Currently, our city's land bureau has established a land supervision department, 35 townships, towns, and sub-district offices have been appointed by the municipal government as "land supervisors," and 1033 villages have been appointed by the township and town people's governments as "land supervisors," forming a three-level land supervision network at the city, township, and village levels.

### 必须制止土地侵权行为

    必须制止土地侵权行为
    湖北省随州市土地管理局　李树森
    近几年，随着城乡经济建设的发展和村（居）民居住条件的改善，对土地的需求量日增。与此同时不按土地管理法规办事、土地侵权的行为也时有发生。从我们随州市的情况看，主要有这样几种现象：
    有的企业、单位强调生产需要，随意侵犯集体土地所有权；有的国家单位变卖国有土地所有权和使用权；有的国家工作人员擅自侵占国有和集体土地建私房；有的村组侵犯国有土地所有权和使用权；有的村民随意买卖集体土地的所有权和使用权。
    土地侵权行为产生的原因是多方面的，其中主要是以下两点：一是对我国现阶段的土地所有权和使用权实行权属分离的特点认识不清。在城镇，有的居民误认为现在城镇的土地仍为私人所有，为土地使用相互闹纠纷；在农村，实行农业生产承包责任制，土地承包到户，有的村民误为集体所有的土地属私人所有，想怎么办就怎么办。二是有的干部土地国策观念、法制观念和全局观念淡薄，不尊重国有土地和集体土地所有者的合法权益，往往习惯用行政的手段，“以权代法”、“以情代法”，导致侵权行为的发生。
    为切实防止土地侵权行为，我认为，除了加强教育外，最重要的工作就是加强土地监察。目前，我市市土地局设置了土地监察科，35个乡、镇、办事处由市政府聘任了“土地监察员”，1033个村由各乡、镇人民政府聘任了“土地监察员”，形成市、乡、村三级土地监察网络。
