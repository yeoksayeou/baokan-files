Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met today in the afternoon with representatives from various countries attending the Fourth Asia-Pacific Regional National Library Directors Conference in the Great Hall of the People.

Wan Li first extended a warm welcome to the representatives from various countries and congratulated the conference on its positive achievements.

He said, "Everyone has had a very good meeting, seriously discussing the exchange and cooperation among national libraries in the Asia-Pacific region. This will play a positive role in strengthening mutual cooperation, enhancing friendship, and promoting the development of library services in various countries. Holding this conference in Beijing will also help the participating countries to better understand China, which is beneficial to promoting the development of China's library services."

Wan Li pointed out that China has a long history and rich culture. Since the founding of New China, the Chinese government has attached great importance to the development of library services. Over the past 40 years, library services have made significant progress, but due to economic constraints, there are still many shortcomings that need to be continuously developed and improved.

Wan Li expressed the hope that the Chinese library community will strengthen exchanges and cooperation with various countries.

The Asia-Pacific Regional National Library Directors Conference is an international regional conference supported and funded by UNESCO, usually held every three years. Its purpose is to promote the sharing of book and information resources and cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific region and internationally.
