Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, December 5th.

An activity titled "Learn from Lei Feng, Practice Selflessness, and Promote New Customs" was launched in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, in May this year and is gradually deepening and expanding.

Shijiazhuang has focused on three main areas of work.

First, it boldly promotes the spirit of Lei Feng through re-education, emphasizing timeliness in content. Under the guidance of the municipal committee, various levels of leaders, mass organizations, news agencies, and industrial enterprises have vigorously carried out discussions and re-evaluations of the spirit of Lei Feng. Some units invited the 16th commander of the Lei Feng Class, Zhu Hua, to give a speech, re-discussing Lei Feng's noble qualities. Many units also held seminars on topics such as "The Spirit of Lei Feng and Reform and Opening Up" and "The Spirit of Lei Feng Today."

Second, it focuses on one's own job, determines industry priorities, and emphasizes the effectiveness of learning from Lei Feng. In law enforcement departments, it combines with the construction of clean government, emphasizing the education of "servant consciousness" and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. Civil servants in municipal offices insist on one day of voluntary labor every month on Saturdays. The education system combines learning from Lei Feng with cultivating "four-haves" new people, using the spirit of Lei Feng to educate and nurture people, and re-establishing Lei Feng's image among students.

Third, it adopts various popular forms to strengthen the mass participation in learning from Lei Feng. One method is to adopt the approach of assigning specific individuals, locations, and times for service, restoring and establishing various Lei Feng learning organizations, and maintaining long-term service. Currently, the city has established 38,000 such organizations, with 130,000 people participating in service activities. Another method is to organize concentrated voluntary services, consultations, visits, and discounted sales according to the characteristics of various festivals, either on the streets or within units. According to incomplete statistics, the city currently has 528,500 people participating in Lei Feng learning activities, with over 8,600 advanced examples emerging.

    突出时代性  注重实效性  强化群众性
    石家庄学雷锋蔚成风气
    全市涌现出先进典型八千六百多个
    本报石家庄电　记者陈国琦报道：一个“学雷锋、讲奉献、树新风”的活动今年5月在河北石家庄市展开后，正逐步向深度和广度发展。
    石家庄市着重抓了三方面的工作。
    理直气壮地进行雷锋精神的再宣传、再教育，在内容上突出时代性。在市委倡导下，全市各级领导、群众团体、新闻单位、工矿企业等大张旗鼓地开展对雷锋精神再认识、再讨论。一些单位请雷锋班第十六任班长朱华作报告，再谈雷锋的高贵品质。不少单位还专题举办“雷锋精神与改革开放”、“雷锋精神在今天”等研讨会。
    立足本职工作，确定行业重点，注重学雷锋活动的实效性。在掌权执法部门，结合廉政建设，着重加强“公仆意识”和全心全意为人民服务宗旨的教育。市直机关干部在学雷锋活动中，坚持每月一次星期六义务劳动。教育系统把学雷锋同培养“四有”新人结合起来，用雷锋精神教人、育人，使雷锋的形象在学生中间重新树立起来。
    采取多种喜闻乐见的形式，强化学雷锋活动的群众性。一是采取定人、定点、定时服务的方法，恢复和建立各种学雷锋组织，坚持常年服务。目前，全市已有组织3.8万多个，13万余人次参加服务活动。二是根据各种节日的不同特点，集中开展在街头或深入到单位义务服务劳动、咨询、慰问及让利销售等活动。据不完全统计，全市目前投入学雷锋活动人数多达52.85万人次，涌现出先进典型8600多个。
