    Villains Use Sweet Talk to Trap Innocent Women
    From the seven cases of abducting and selling women that our county has cracked down on this year, it can be seen that the criminals have seriously infringed upon the personal rights of women and endangered social security.

    In July, Li, a young man from Xifeng City, Gansu Province, impersonated an active-duty military officer and, under the pretext of introducing a job, lured a young woman to Donghai County, Jiangsu Province. He then colluded with two other individuals to sell the young woman to a young man in Dalin Township of our county for 3,800 yuan. When Li and the other two men left Dalin Township with the money, they were apprehended by the joint defense team.

    In August, Chen and Zhu, who came from Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, and had their names engraved in Beijing, falsely claimed that they could help find a job. They abducted a young woman from Laiwu City, Shandong Province, who was working as a nanny in Beijing, to Donghai County. They sold her to a middle-aged man in Dalin Township of our county for 3,000 yuan. The criminals escaped with the money, and the young woman, upon realizing she had been deceived, reported the case to the relevant authorities.

    In May, Wu, a young man from Liu Pan Shui City, Guizhou Province, lured a young woman from Guizhou to Heilin Township in the mountainous area of our county and sold her to a middle-aged man for 3,700 yuan. After nine days, the woman escaped. Wu returned to Guizhou with the money and soon brought another woman to Heilin Township to prepare for another deception and sale, but he was discovered and captured by the locals. A few days later, Chen and Guo, young men from Guizhou, abducted a married woman from Guizhou to Jianshan Township in the mountainous area of our county. They agreed to sell her for 2,000 yuan, but the group was captured after being reported by the locals.

    The problem of abducting and selling women should be given serious attention by party and government organizations at all levels, public security organs, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation. It is hoped that the whole society will pay attention to this issue and make joint efforts to effectively protect the legal rights of women and children.

    坏人花言巧语  良女误入圈套
    从我县今年破获的7起拐卖妇女案情况看。犯罪分子严重侵害了妇女的人身权益，危害了社会治安。
    7月，甘肃省西峰市青年李某冒充现役军官，以介绍工作为名，将一女青年骗至江苏省东海县。又勾结另外两人，以3800元的价格将女青年卖给我县大岭乡一青年。当李某等3人携款离开大岭乡时，被联防队查获。
    8月，江苏省东海县青湖镇在北京刻字的陈某、朱某谎称能帮助找工作，将山东省莱芜市在北京市做保姆的一女青年拐骗至东海县，以3000元的价格卖给我县大岭乡一中年男人。罪犯得款而逃，女青年知受骗后，向有关部门报案。
    5月，贵州省六盘水市青年吴某将一女青年从贵州骗来我县山区黑林乡，以3700元的价格卖给一中年男人。过了9天，该女偷跑出走。吴某得款回贵州后，不久又带一妇女来黑林乡准备骗卖，被群众发现抓获。事隔不几天，贵州青年陈某、郭某，从贵州将一有夫之妇拐骗到我县山区夹山乡，商定以2000元骗卖，经群众举报，这伙人被抓获。
    拐卖妇女这一社会问题，应引起各级党政组织、公安机关、共青团和妇联的重视。希望全社会都来关心这个问题，共同努力，切实保护妇女、儿童的合法权益。
