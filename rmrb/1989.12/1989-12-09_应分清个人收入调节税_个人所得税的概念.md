Edition: 6

Your newspaper's September 2nd, 6th edition published a reader's letter titled "Unveiling the Secrets of Individual Household 'Wealth,'" which mentioned: According to national regulations, for monthly net income exceeding 800 yuan, an additional "personal income tax" must be paid at a certain rate. This statement is likely derived from the personal income tax law promulgated by the National People's Congress in 1980. In September 1986, the State Council issued the "Provisional Regulations on Personal Income Adjustment Tax," stipulating that for Chinese citizens whose monthly comprehensive income exceeds three times the local tax base, a personal income adjustment tax will be levied. After the implementation of the personal income adjustment tax, personal income tax became a tax levied on foreigners in China. After Chinese citizens pay the personal income adjustment tax, they no longer need to pay personal income tax. If it is an individual industrial and commercial household, then according to the "Provisional Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Household Income Tax" issued by the State Council in January 1986, a tax will be levied on their annual net income.

    应分清个人收入调节税  个人所得税的概念
    你报九月二日第六版刊登的《个体户“发财”探秘》的读者来信提到：国家规定，凡月纯收入超过八百元以上的部分，还要按比例交纳“个人所得税”。这种说法估计是从一九八零年全国人民代表大会颁布的个人所得税法得来的。一九八六年九月，国务院发布了个人收入调节税暂行条例，规定对我国公民月综合收入额超过地区计税基数三倍以上的部分，征收个人收入调节税。开征个人收入调节税后，个人所得税成为对在华的外国人征收的一种税，我国公民在缴纳了个人收入调节税后，就不再缴纳个人所得税了。如果是个体工商户，则按国务院一九八六年一月发布的城乡个体工商业户所得税暂行条例，对其年度纯收入征收城乡个体工商业户所得税。
