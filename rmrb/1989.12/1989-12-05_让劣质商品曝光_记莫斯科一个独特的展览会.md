Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd.

A unique exhibition opened on November 28th at the National Economic Achievements Exhibition Hall in Moscow, attracting many locals to view it.

Upon entering the exhibition hall, visitors were greeted by a variety of substandard goods: charcoal-like bread, misaligned shoes, dolls with only one eye open, and bras as thick and heavy as bulletproof vests.

This distinctive exhibition was organized by the All-Union Consumer Association on the eve of its founding conference. Visitors could also see chairs priced at the equivalent of two watches, which fell apart after a short period of use. Six types of cassette tape recorders priced between 140 and 344 rubles, with outdated designs and poor sound quality, were still being produced despite being unsellable in the market. Additionally, there were bags of biscuits containing a piece of old belt and bottles of mineral water with rotten vegetable roots.

This exhibition of inferior goods highlighted the serious quality issues in Soviet consumer products and demonstrated the country's determination to improve product quality.

For many years, the Soviet Union prioritized the development of heavy industry and military industry while neglecting the production of consumer goods, resulting in a long-term shortage of daily necessities and food. Some production units believed that these goods were always in short supply, and even substandard products could be sold. Poor quality was often overlooked. According to exhibition materials, the scrap rate for televisions, radios, clothing, and footwear has long been in double digits, and about 7% of food industry products are unqualified.

All the substandard goods on display were labeled with prices, manufacturer names, and product defects. This served as a stern criticism of enterprises producing defective products. The Consumer Association has urged the state quality inspection team to station personnel in such enterprises, halt the production of substandard products, and improve quality.

Coincidentally, in Moscow, there is a 10-person "Hot Pepper" theater troupe that specializes in satirizing manufacturers of substandard clothing. The performers wear these substandard clothes on stage, sing satirical songs, and announce the names of the manufacturers, making the managers of these enterprises uneasy.

    让劣质商品曝光
    ——记莫斯科一个独特的展览会

    11月28日在莫斯科国民经济成就展览馆内开幕的一个独特的展览会，吸引了众多的莫斯科人前来观看。
    走进展厅后，展现在面前的是各种劣等商品：焦炭似的面包、龇牙咧嘴的皮鞋、只能睁一只眼睛的洋娃娃、像防弹背心般又厚又重的胸罩……
    这个别具一格的展览是由苏联消费者协会全国联合会在成立大会前夕举办的。人们在这里还能看到售价相当于两只手表的椅子，坐不多久便散了架。价值140至344卢布的6种单卡录音机，式样陈旧，音质单薄，在市场上早已无人问津，但厂家还在源源不断地生产。在这里你还能看到混有一截旧皮带的袋装饼干和瓶里有烂菜根的矿泉水等劣质商品。这些劣质商品展览告诉观众，苏联生产的消费品的质量存在着严重的问题，同时也显示了苏联促使厂家提高产品质量的决心。
    多年来，苏联重视重工业和军工业的发展，轻视民用商品生产的发展，使生活消费品和食品工业长期处于落后状态，消费品长期短缺。有些生产单位的经营思想是，这些商品总是短缺，即使劣等次品也卖得出去，粗制滥造也无人过问。据展览会提供的资料，电视机、收音机和服装、鞋靴的废品率长期保持在两位数上，食品工业约7％的产品不合格。
    这次展出的劣等品一律标明价目、厂家名称和产品的毛病。这对生产残次品的企业是一次严厉的批评。消费者协会已敦促国家质量验收组派员进驻这类企业，限期停产劣等产品，改进质量。
    无独有偶，莫斯科有一个10人组成的“辣椒”小剧团，专门讽刺生产劣等服装的厂商。演员们穿着这种劣等服装在舞台上表演，唱讽刺歌，向观众报出厂家名称，使这些企业的经理坐立不安。　（新华社莫斯科12月3日电）
