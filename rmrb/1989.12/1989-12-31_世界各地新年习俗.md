New Year customs vary greatly around the world. In Britain, on New Year's Eve, people carry cakes and wine to visit friends and relatives. They do not knock on the door but enter directly. Before chatting with their friends, they tend to the fire in the fireplace, symbolizing "good luck in the new year." The British also have the tradition of staying up until midnight.

In Canada, snow is considered auspicious. When the New Year arrives, people often pile snow around their homes, building snow walls. They believe this can ward off evil spirits and bring happiness and joy.

In Italy, New Year's Eve is a night of celebration. As night falls, people gather in the streets, setting off firecrackers and fireworks, and dancing until midnight. At this time, family members throw out old items from the windows, believing this will rid them of troubles and bad luck, bringing good fortune. On New Year's Day, every household keeps a fire burning day and night, ensuring a smooth year ahead.

In France, the weather on New Year's Day is seen as an omen for the coming year: a south wind brings a year of good weather and prosperity; a west wind promises a good year for fishing and dairy farming; an east wind indicates a bountiful harvest of fruits.

In Germany, New Year's celebrations include traditional tree-climbing competitions. Additionally, Germans often form bands and parade through the streets, playing music to welcome the New Year.

In Switzerland, during the New Year, people bring in snow from outside, melt it into water, and sprinkle it on the ground to settle the dust, then proceed with cleaning. The Swiss consider snow to be auspicious.

On the Greek island of Tinos, before New Year's Eve, a large round stone covered in moss is moved into the house, symbolizing prosperity and a bountiful harvest. In Crete, Greece, when visiting someone, people bring a large stone into the house and place it on the floor, wishing the owner, "May your home be as rich as this stone."

In Portugal, bullfighting is popular. Around New Year's, for about 10 days, thousands of people, young and old, flock to the bullfighting arenas to watch the exciting performances.

In Spain, on New Year's Eve, families gather together. When the church bells ring at midnight, everyone tries to eat 12 grapes, one for each chime. If they can eat all 12, it is believed that each month of the new year will be fortunate.

In Bulgaria, during the New Year's Eve dinner, the host gives the first lamb, cow, or foal to the first person who sneezes. Bulgarians believe that the person who sneezes will bring happiness to the entire family.

In Hungary, people generally avoid eating poultry and fish on New Year's Eve. It is said that eating these foods will cause happiness to fly away like birds or slip away like fish.

    世界各地新年习俗
    英国人在除夕的深夜，人们带上糕点和酒出去拜访亲友。他们不敲门，就径直走进亲友家中。在同亲友谈话之前，先拨弄壁炉的火，象征“开门大吉”。英国人同样有“守岁”的习惯。
    加拿大人视白雪为祥瑞。在新年来到时，往往把雪堆在住宅周围，筑成一道道雪墙。他们相信这样可以阻止邪魔进犯，同时将带来幸福和欢乐。
    意大利人的除夕是狂欢之夜。当夜幕降临，人们纷纷拥到街头，燃爆竹放焰火，男男女女翩翩起舞，一直跳到午夜时分。这时由家人拾些旧物，从窗口抛出去，认为这样可以去掉烦恼和恶运，以示吉祥。元旦这天，各家各户都燃起一炉火，日夜不熄。这样在一年里一切都会顺利。
    法国人把元旦这一天的天气看做是新一年的年景：刮南风，新的一年风调雨顺，一切顺利；刮西风，有一个捕鱼和挤奶的丰收年；刮东风，水果将高产。
    德国人过新年，有传统的爬树比赛。此外，德国人多在新年那天组成乐队，通街游行演奏，欢庆新一年的到来。
    瑞士人过年时，从屋外取些白雪，化成水，洒在地上压尘，然后进行清扫。瑞士人认为白雪是吉祥的。
    希腊的提诺斯岛上，除夕前要搬进一块长满藓苔的大圆石头，象征财源茂盛，五谷丰登。在希腊的克里特岛上，拜年要带上一块大石头，进屋后把它放在地板上，然后向主人祝愿说：“但愿你家有一块像这石头一样大的金子。”
    葡萄牙的斗牛之风盛行，在每年元旦前后10天，是斗牛的高潮。成千上万的人扶老携幼，潮水般涌向市镇斗牛场，以观看斗牛士的精彩表演。
    西班牙人在除夕之夜，全家团聚在一起，待12点教堂的钟声敲响的时候，大家便争着吃葡萄。如果能按着钟声吃下12颗，便是象征着新年的每个月都一切如意。
    保加利亚人在吃年夜饭的时候，主人要把第一只羊羔、第一头牛或者第一匹马驹，送给第一个打喷嚏的人。他们认为打喷嚏的人会给全家带来幸福。
    匈牙利人一般除夕忌食飞禽和鱼类。据说，吃了这些食物，幸福就会像飞禽那样飞走，像鱼儿那样溜走。
