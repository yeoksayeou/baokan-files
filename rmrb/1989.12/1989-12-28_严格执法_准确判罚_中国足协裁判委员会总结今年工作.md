The Chinese Football Association's Referees Committee recently held a meeting of its standing committee to summarize the year's refereeing work nationwide and to outline the main tasks for the coming year: to boost morale, work hard, strengthen the ideological and organizational work of the refereeing team, enforce the rules strictly, manage strictly, crack down on poor on-field behavior, and genuinely improve the level of refereeing and the accuracy of on-field decisions to ensure that no major incidents occur during matches.

The standing committee, in summarizing this year's refereeing work, pointed out that in the more than 800 refereeing assignments nationwide this year, major incidents were largely avoided. In particular, the matches in the A Group of this year's National Football League were completed well and received praise from all teams. In major international competitions, Chinese referees also completed their tasks quite successfully.

The committee members believe that the lessons learned from the lax refereeing in domestic matches, which led to difficulties in international competitions, should be taken to heart. Referees should dare to make calls, enforce discipline strictly, and instill in coaches and athletes the absolute obedience to referees on the field. At the same time, the construction of the refereeing team itself remains very important.

    严格执法　准确判罚
    中国足协裁判委员会总结今年工作
    本报讯　据《中国体育报》报道：中国足球协会裁判委员会最近召开常委会会议，对今年的全国裁判工作进行总结，并提出了明年工作的主要任务：振奋精神，艰苦奋斗，加强裁判队伍思想工作和组织建设，严格执法，严格管理，狠抓赛场作风，切实提高裁判水平和临场判罚的准确性，确保比赛不发生重大事故。
    常委会在总结今年裁判工作时指出，在今年国内800多人次的裁判工作中，基本上避免了重大事件的发生，尤其是今年的全国足球甲级联赛A组的比赛完成得较好，受到各队的好评。在重大国际比赛中，我国裁判员也比较出色地完成了任务。
    常委们认为，应该吸取由于国内比赛时判罚不严而造成的在国际比赛中大吃苦头的教训，敢于判罚，严明纪律，使广大教练员和运动员牢固树立场上绝对服从裁判的观念。同时，加强裁判员队伍自身的建设也依然十分重要。
