The United Nations is facing severe financial difficulties. The United States owes $430 million in dues.

New York, December 12 (Xinhua) - United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar warned today that if member states do not pay their dues in full and on time, the United Nations will face an even more serious financial crisis in 1990.

The Secretary-General called on all member states to pay their dues in full as early as possible before January next year. The United Nations budget for the 1990-1991 fiscal year is $1.983 billion.

In his report on the United Nations' financial crisis, the Secretary-General said that as of December 8, 1989, only 72 member states had paid their dues in full for the 1988-1989 fiscal year. Among the 87 member states that have not paid their dues, 22 have not paid a single cent.

The Secretary-General said that the United States is the largest debtor to the United Nations, owing $430 million. The United States is responsible for paying 25% of the United Nations budget each year.

    秘书长呼吁所有会员国尽早在明年一月前交纳应承担的全部会费。联合国一九九○至一九九一年度的预算是十九点八三亿美元。
    秘书长在关于联合国财政危机的报告中说，截至一九八九年十二月八日只有七十二个成员国如数交纳了一九八八至一九八九年的会费，在拖欠会费的八十七个成员国中有二十二个成员国分文未交。
    秘书长说，美国是联合国最大的债务国，拖欠的会费已达四点三亿美元。美国每年应承交的会费占联合国预算的百分之二十五。
