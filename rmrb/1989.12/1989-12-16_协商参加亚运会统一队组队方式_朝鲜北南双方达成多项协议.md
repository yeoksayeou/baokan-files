Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 15th.

Workers' representatives from North and South Korea met today in Panmunjom for their third round of talks. The two sides reached multiple agreements on forming a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games, which will be held in Beijing.

According to reports, based on the partial agreements reached in the previous two meetings, the two sides continued to fully discuss the formation of the unified team. Both sides agreed to hold public trials after the joint training period. The head coach for each event will be from the side with more athletes participating in that event. The translators for the unified team will be determined based on the proportion of athletes from each side. The training and competition expenses for the unified team will be jointly borne by both sides in principle, while the travel expenses for athletes and relevant personnel between the North and South will be borne by the inviting side. Both sides also reached a consensus on ensuring the personal safety of athletes and other personnel. The two sides determined the operating methods and functions of the North-South Joint Committee for the Unified Team and the Joint Affairs Bureau, but held different opinions on the location of the Joint Affairs Bureau.

In today's meeting, the South Korean representative again raised the issue of the Chinese translation of the unified team's name. According to the South Korean "Dong-A Ilbo," the South suggested translating the agreed team name "KOREA" into Chinese as "高丽亚" (Gaoliya). However, the North Korean representative insisted that the Chinese translation of the unified team's name should be decided by the host country, China, and that both sides do not need to discuss this issue further. After three meetings, North and South Korea have reached agreements on most of the detailed issues regarding the selection and formation of the unified team. The two sides' sports delegations will hold their sixth formal meeting on December 22nd to discuss the remaining issues that have not yet been agreed upon.

    协商参加亚运会统一队组队方式
    朝鲜北南双方达成多项协议
    新华社平壤12月15日电  （记者张锦芳）朝鲜北方和南方体育代表团工作代表今天在板门店进行了第三次接触。双方就组成统一队参加在北京举行的第十一届亚运会问题达成多项协议。
    据报道，双方在前两次接触达成部分协议的基础上，今天继续对统一队的组队方式进行了充分协商。双方同意，在共同训练后期双方进行公开选拔赛。项目主教练由参加该项目运动员多的一方担任，统一队翻译根据双方运动员的比例确定。统一队训练和参加比赛的费用原则上由双方共同负担，统一队运动员及有关人员在北南之间往来的费用由邀请一方负担。双方还就保障运动员和其他人员的人身安全等问题取得了一致意见。双方确定了统一队北南共同委员会以及共同委员会的办事机构共同事务局的活动方式和职能，但对共同事务局的地点问题持不同意见。
    在今天的接触中，南方代表再次提出统一队名称的中文译法问题。据南朝鲜《东亚日报》报道，南方建议将双方已达成协议的队名“KOREA”译成中文为“高利雅”。但是，北方代表仍然表示，统一队名称的中文译法应由举办国中国方面决定，双方不必再讨论这个问题。朝鲜北南方代表经过3次接触已就统一队的选拔和组队方式的大部分细节问题达成了协议。双方体育代表团将于本月22日举行第六次正式会谈，讨论尚未达成协议的其他问题。
