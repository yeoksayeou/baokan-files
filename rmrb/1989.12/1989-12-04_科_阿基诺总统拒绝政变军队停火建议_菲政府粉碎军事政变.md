According to reports, approximately 1000 coup troops gathered around the Armed Forces of the Philippines headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo surrendered to the government troops at noon today. Defense Secretary Ramos said that this fact indicates that the rebels have been completely defeated.

However, the military coup aimed at overthrowing the Corazon Aquino government, which broke out at 1 a.m. today, has not yet been fully suppressed. Government troops and rebels are still engaged in fierce battles in some parts of Manila.

Reports say that about 500 coup soldiers have moved from the Army headquarters at Fort Bonifacio to some buildings in the nearby Makati business center, where they are putting up a stubborn resistance. This morning, government troops dispatched helicopters and fighter jets to launch a fierce attack on the rebel strongholds.

According to another report, in Cebu, the second-largest city in the Philippines, about 300 coup soldiers have occupied the Mactan Air Base near Cebu International Airport and refused to surrender. However, Ramos said today that the rebels in Cebu have been "isolated" and will receive no reinforcements.

Ramos claimed that the government troops will continue to attack the rebels. He said, "We hope to end the battle today (December 3)."

President Corazon Aquino made a statement on television this morning, rejecting the coup forces' proposal for a ceasefire. She also urged Manila residents not to go out to avoid bloodshed in the military exchanges.

According to reports, at least 52 people have died and 150 have been injured in the fighting between the coup and counter-coup forces. In Manila, schools have been indefinitely suspended, shops have closed, and all domestic and international flights have been canceled.

The Philippine Defense Secretary Ramos said at a press conference today that the government troops have crushed the coup launched by the rebel forces.

Ramos said that although street battles between government troops and coup forces are still ongoing in Makati, Greenhills, and Ayala, the main force of the coup forces has been subdued by the government troops. This afternoon, the government troops began to mop up the remaining coup forces.

The Chief of Staff of the Philippine Armed Forces, Renato de Villa, said, "Most of the coup leaders and their soldiers are now on the run."

According to local radio broadcasts, about 400 coup soldiers have surrendered to the government troops this afternoon.

The radio broadcast today said that government departments will resume work tomorrow. International flights in Manila will also resume tomorrow morning.

    科·阿基诺总统拒绝政变军队停火建议
    菲政府粉碎军事政变
    新华社马尼拉12月3日电  据报道，集结在菲律宾武装部队司令部所在地阿吉纳尔多军营周围的政变部队约1000人今天中午向政府军投降。国防部长拉莫斯说，这一事实表明叛军已经彻底失败。
    然而，1日凌晨爆发的旨在推翻科·阿基诺政府的军事政变至今尚未被全部平息。政府军与叛军今天仍在马尼拉的一些地方进行激战。
    报道说，约500名政变军已从陆军司令部所在地博尼法西奥军营转移到附近的马卡蒂商业中心的一些建筑物中，负隅顽抗。今天上午，政府军出动直升机和战斗机，向叛军据点发起猛攻。
    另据报道，在菲律宾第二大城市宿务，约300多名政变军占领了接近宿务国际机场的马克坦空军基地，拒绝投降。但拉莫斯今天说，宿务的叛军“已被孤立”，他们得不到任何增援。
    拉莫斯声称，政府军将继续向叛军发起进攻。他说，“我们希望能在今天（3日）结束战斗。”
    科·阿基诺总统今天上午在电视台发表声明，拒绝接受政变军队提出的停火建议。她还呼吁马尼拉居民不要出门，以避免在军队交火中流血。
    据报道，在政变与反政变的战斗中，至少有52人死亡，150人受伤。在马尼拉，学校已无限期停课，商店纷纷关门，所有国内国际航班已经停飞。
    新华社马尼拉12月3日电  菲律宾国防部长拉莫斯今天在记者招待会上说，政府军已经粉碎了叛乱部队发起的政变。
    拉莫斯说，尽管在麦加蒂区、格林希尔斯区和阿亚拉区政府军和政变部队之间的巷战还在进行，但政变部队的主力部分已被政府军制服。今天下午，政府军开始对残余的政变军进行扫荡。
    菲武装部参谋长雷纳托·德维利亚说，“大多数政变头目和他们的士兵眼下正在四处逃窜。”
    据此间电台广播，今天下午约有400名政变士兵已向政府军投降。
    电台今天广播说，政府各部门明天将恢复工作。马尼拉的国际航班明天上午也将重开。
