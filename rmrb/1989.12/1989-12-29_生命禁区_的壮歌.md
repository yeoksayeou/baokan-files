The "lifeless zone" of Karakoram Mountain is a place of extreme oxygen deprivation and perpetual frost. Biologists have declared it a "lifeless zone." However, a certain border defense regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region has been stationed here for many years. Medical experts say, "Soldiers guarding the Karakoram Mountain area at an average altitude of over 4500 meters cannot be explained from a physiological or medical perspective. The only explanation is their unwavering love for the motherland!"

Bai Daqing, former regiment commander, has been stationed here for over 10 years, familiar with every strategic pass and high ground within the 60,000-square-kilometer defense area. He understands that a soldier's value lies in selfless devotion to the motherland.

Soldier Chen Jianglian enlisted from Xi'an in 1986. In the winter of 1987, while guarding the Shenshiyan outpost, he received a call from home: "Mother is critically ill, come back quickly!" He cried and shouted, wanting to rush back to see his mother one last time. The company immediately decided to clear the snow and send a car to take him down the mountain. Chen Jianglian refused, saying, "I can't let my comrades' physical condition deteriorate further; there is only one car at the outpost, and if an emergency occurs, it will be difficult to handle; personal matters are small, guarding the outpost is important, and we need manpower here, I'm not leaving!" Two months later, his father sent him a photo of his mother. Chen Jianglian wept, "Mother, forgive me, your son is a soldier..."

The harsh natural environment severely damages the bodies of the border guards. Radio station director Shen Guoping was as strong as an ox when he enlisted. He has been in the border defense for 15 consecutive years, unknowingly suffering from multiple diseases. High-altitude heart disease and stomach ulcers torment him so much that he can barely walk straight, and he has to use a stick to go to the toilet. The regiment has repeatedly urged him to go down the mountain, but he fears that others will have difficulty completing the task, so he has been holding on.

One day, the regiment commander inspected the work and saw his face turning blue and his body as thin as the red willow stick he was leaning on. The commander was so heartbroken that he got angry: "Why didn't you go down when I told you to do so many times?" He immediately ordered the outpost to send a car to take him down the mountain for treatment. After the examination, the doctor said he had leukemia, and his life could only be sustained for a few more months.

The border defense soldiers of Karakoram Mountain have composed a moving border defense ballad with their bodies and patriotic love. Some, due to high-altitude communication difficulties, were misunderstood by their girlfriends and could not find a girlfriend even at the age of 30. Some, due to frostbite, lost their arms and legs, became disabled for life, and even lost their young lives. More soldiers have spent their golden youth in the wind and snow of the border. But no one in the entire regiment has retreated because of fear of hardship. Although everyone's lips are black, hair is falling out, eyes are bloodshot, and fingernails are concave, their willpower is tens of times stronger than that of people in the lowlands.

Lieutenant Li Bingxing is the deputy company commander of the outpost. His facial nerves are paralyzed, which is caused by the high-altitude cold wind.

There is another soldier named Ding Yuechao. When he first came to the outpost, he suffered from severe high-altitude reactions, with elevated hemoglobin, facial swelling, blue lips, frequent nosebleeds, and vomiting. The company was preparing to send him down the mountain for treatment, but he refused to leave.

Regiment Chief of Staff Zhao Lu said, "We have endured this hardship, and the people down the mountain will feel safe. As long as the Party is at ease and the people of the motherland are at ease, this hardship is worth it!"

    “生命禁区”的壮歌
    董建生　安红　杨功成
    极度缺氧，终年封冻，这就是喀喇昆仑山。生物学家宣布这儿是“生命禁区”。然而，新疆军区某边防团却在这里长年驻守。医学专家们说：“战士们在平均海拔4500米以上的喀喇昆仑山区守防，已不能从生理医学的角度给予解释。唯一的解释，只能是对祖国忠贞不渝的爱！”
    柏大庆，边防团原团长。他在这里戍边整整10多年，熟悉防区6万多平方公里中的每一处险要关隘，所有具有战略意义的高地、山口，都留下了他的足迹。因为他明白，军人的价值，就在于对祖国的无私奉献。
    战士陈江联，1986年从西安入伍。1987年冬，他正在神仙湾哨卡守防，接到家中来电：“母病危，速回！”他大哭大喊，要赶回去再看妈妈一眼。连里立即决定，全连挖雪开道，派车送他下山。陈江联拒绝了，他说：“不能让战友们的体质再为我下降；哨卡上只有一台车，如遇到突发情况，难以应付；个人事小，守防事大，哨卡上需要人手，我不走了！”两个月后，父亲给他寄来了母亲的遗像，陈江联泪流满面：“妈妈，原谅我，你儿子是军人……”
    险恶的自然环境，残酷地损害着戍边战士的身躯。电台台长沈国平，入伍时健壮如牛。他在边防连续干了15年，不知不觉中患了多种疾病，高原心脏病和胃溃疡，折磨得他走路连腰都直不起，上趟厕所也得拄根棍子。团里几次催他下山，他怕其他同志完成任务有困难，一直撑着。
    一天，团长检查工作，见他脸色青紫，身板像他拄的红柳棍一样，团长心疼得发火了：“多次让你下去，为什么不下？”当即责令哨卡派车送他下山住院治疗。经检查，医生说他患了白血病，生命顶多只能维持几个月。
    喀喇昆仑山的边防官兵用自己的身躯和赤诚的爱国心，奏出了一曲曲催人泪下的戍边壮歌。有的因高原通信困难，被姑娘误解，30多岁了，还找不到女朋友。有的因伤冻断臂截肢，终身残废，甚至失去年轻的生命。更多的战士在风雪边防送去了黄金般的青春岁月。但全团官兵谁也没有因为怕吃苦就退下去。虽然大伙嘴唇乌黑，头发脱落，眼底充血，指甲凹陷，可意志要比山下的人坚强数十倍。
    中尉军官李兵行，是哨卡副连长。他的面部神经麻痹，那是高原寒风吹的。
    还有一个战士，他叫丁跃超，刚上哨卡时，因高山反应严重，血色素升高，脸面红肿，嘴唇发青，经常流鼻血，呕吐不断，连队准备送他下山治疗，可他怎么也不肯走。
    边防团参谋长赵禄说：“我们吃了这份苦，山下的人们就会感到安全，只要党放心，祖国人民放心，吃这苦，值得！”
