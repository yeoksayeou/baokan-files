Ji Linwang, the director of Bai Ta Credit Union in Shanhua City, Hebei Province, has been working in the financial system for 33 years.

In recent years, he has refused to accept various bribes totaling 744,600 yuan, including 530,000 yuan in cash, 6 18-inch color TVs, 1 refrigerator, 1 high-end electric chair, 2 Huasheng brand electric fans, as well as cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, and meat. At the same time, he has rejected 32 companies' requests to become a silent partner. In September of this year, he was named a National Advanced Worker.

Bai Ta Credit Union has 5 branches, 15 credit stations, and 6 savings agencies, with a total of 25 million yuan in credit funds. It is responsible for the financial transactions of more than 130 rural enterprises and individual economies. At the door of the "financial god" Ji Linwang, people come to "burn incense and make offerings" in an endless stream.

A few years ago, one of Ji Linwang's acquaintances introduced a private businessman from Wu'an County to Bai Ta Credit Union, seeking a loan. The businessman quietly said to him, "You have the power to approve a loan of 10,000 yuan. If you approve it for me, I will give you a thousand yuan as a reward." Ji Linwang immediately replied, "To put it nicely, you don't know my character. To put it badly, you are insulting my dignity. I cannot approve a loan that does not meet the regulations, no matter who introduces it!" Seeing that there was no hope, the acquaintance left in disappointment.

Another time, a purchasing agent from a company stationed in the city came to Ji Linwang and quietly said, "I plan to purchase a batch of steel. If you lend me 50,000 yuan, I can make a profit of 50,000 yuan. We can split it fifty-fifty." Ji Linwang said, "If you want to make money, I advise you to think of more ways on the right path, not to go around in circles on the wrong path." He immediately rejected the request.

One cold winter night, Ji Linwang was on duty at the credit union. The next day, when he returned home for breakfast, he saw a Shanghai-brand 18-inch color TV on the table and was puzzled. He asked his wife about it, and she said, "Last night, a young man came to the house and said he was bringing coal from the mine. He left something for us and didn't even have time to ask his name before he left." Upon hearing this, Ji Linwang immediately realized that this was probably a gift sent intentionally, as his son was getting married at the time. He moved the TV to the credit union and explained the situation to everyone, and then mobilized all the staff to conduct a 5-day investigation of the more than 100 key accounts that had credit relationships with the union in the past year. Finally, they found the person who sent the gift. A few days later, Ji Linwang invited the farmer for a heart-to-heart talk. Ji Linwang talked about the qualities and style that a Party cadre should have, and the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. In the end, the farmer still insisted on not taking back the "gift." Later, Ji Linwang had no choice but to sell the color TV at the market price at that time and sent 1,500 yuan in cash to the farmer through two colleagues.

The location of Bai Ta Credit Union is also Ji Linwang's hometown. The villagers know that he is in charge of the "money" and all want to benefit from it. But Ji Linwang believes: personal feelings cannot be higher than principles, and personal feelings cannot exceed the law. One day, his nephew anxiously said, "I have already arranged to buy a car, and now I just need the money. Can you lend me 50,000 yuan?" After asking him some questions, Ji Linwang firmly said, "I cannot lend you the money. First, you are not a driver and do not know how to drive. Second, there is no guarantee of fuel or cargo volume. Third, and most importantly, you have no personal funds, so according to the regulations, you cannot be lent money." His nephew said, "I can hire a driver if I don't know how to drive; if there is no fuel, I can find a way; as for the third point, you can make an exception as the director." No matter how much he begged, Ji Linwang would not agree. In the end, his nephew got so angry that he said he was "heartless." Ji Linwang said, "I cannot use state money to curry favor."

    三十三年如一日
    ——记全国先进工作者纪林旺
    本报记者　李建兴
    河北省沙河市白塔信用社主任纪林旺，在金融系统已经工作了33个春秋。
    近几年来，他先后拒收各种贿赂总额7.446万元，其中现金5.3万余元，18英寸彩电6台，电冰箱1台，高级电光椅1对，华声牌电扇2台，还有烟、酒、糖、肉类等。同时，还拒绝了32家企业请他入暗股。今年9月，他被评为全国先进工作者。
    白塔信用社下设5个分社，15个信用站，6个储蓄代办所，拥有信贷资金2500万元，担负着130多个乡村企业和个体经济的资金融通工作。在信用社主任老纪这个“财神爷”的门口，前来“烧香、进贡”的人络绎不绝。
    前些年，老纪的一个熟人，介绍武安县一个体经商户，向白塔信用社恳求一笔贷款。这个经商户悄悄对他说：“你手里掌握着批放一万元款的大权，如果批放给我一万元，回扣一千元作为酬金。”老纪不假思索地说：“说得好听些，是你不清楚我的为人。说得难听些，你这是污辱我的人格。不符合规定的贷款，不管谁介绍我也不能办！”这个熟人一看没指望了，只好扫兴而归。
    还有一次，驻市企业一个采购员找到老纪，悄悄地说：“我准备搞一批钢材，你贷给我5万元款，回来能赚5万元，咱俩二一添作五分了。”老纪说：“你要想发财，我劝你还是在正道上多想门路，少在歪道上打圈圈。”当即拒绝了他的请求。
    一个寒冬的夜晚，老纪在信用社值班。第二天回家吃早饭，看见桌子上放着一台上海牌18英寸彩电，心中纳闷。他问老伴是怎么回事，老伴说：“昨晚有一个年轻人来到家里，说去煤矿拉煤，给咱捎来一件东西，还没顾上问姓名，就出门了。”听老伴一讲，老纪马上意识到，眼下正是儿子操办婚事的时候，这很可能是特意送来的礼品。于是，他把彩电搬到信用社，当着大家的面说明情况，并发动全社职工对一年来与本社发生信贷关系的100多个重点户进行了5天时间的明查暗访，终于找到了送礼人。几天后，老纪把这位农民请来推心置腹的长谈。纪林旺从党的干部应具备的品质和作风，讲到全心全意为人民服务的宗旨。最后，那位农民还是执意不肯收回“礼品”。后来，老纪只好按当时市场零售价卖掉彩电，又派两名同志把1500元现金如数交还给这位农民。
    白塔信用社所在地，也是老纪的桑梓之地。乡里乡亲知道他掌管着“钱”的权力，都想沾点光。但老纪认为：人情不能高于原则，人情不能超越“王法”。有一天，他的一个外甥焦急地说：“我已经联系好了买车的事，现在就等钱了。贷给我5万元吧。”老纪询问了他一些情况后斩钉截铁地说：“款，不能贷给你。第一，你不是司机，不懂驾驶技术。第二，汽油、货运量没有保障。第三，最主要的一条，你没有一点自有资金，按照规定不能贷。”他的外甥说：“我不会开车可以雇司机；没有汽油，可以找门路；至于第三条，你当主任就不能通融通融？”任他百般乞求，老纪就是不答应。最后把外甥惹急了，说他“六亲不认”。老纪说：“我不能拿国家的钱送人情。”
