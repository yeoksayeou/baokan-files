The State Council's Decision on Relying on Scientific and Technological Progress to Revitalize Agriculture and Strengthen the Promotion of Agricultural Scientific and Technological Achievements (November 27, 1989)

Agriculture, particularly grain production, is the foundation for the development of the entire national economy. The development of agriculture relies on three factors: policy, science and technology, and investment. Ultimately, problems must be solved through science. Especially in today's world where science and technology are rapidly advancing, to fundamentally solve the agricultural problems that determine the rise and fall of the nation, relying on science and technology to revitalize agriculture is of paramount importance. China has a large population and limited land. To solve the food problem for 1.1 billion people, we must focus on increasing agricultural labor productivity, increasing the yield per unit area of crops, and effectively utilizing resources. Only by relying on scientific and technological progress can we achieve a profound transformation in agricultural technology, and there is hope for the modernization of Chinese agriculture. Therefore, all levels of government must regard relying on scientific and technological progress to revitalize agriculture as a major strategic measure and persistently carry it out. The current primary task is to vigorously promote the application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements. All levels of government should organize the departments of agriculture (including forestry and water conservancy), science and technology, education, industry, planning, finance, commerce, finance, and the broad masses of cadres and the people to work together and achieve results. To this end, the following decisions are made:

1. Vigorously Strengthen the Promotion and Application of Agricultural Scientific and Technological Achievements

In the past decade, China has achieved more than 25,000 major agricultural scientific and technological achievements, but many of them have not been widely applied, and there is great potential. Organizing and planning the promotion and application of a large number of mature and applicable scientific and technological achievements on a large scale and in a wide area is an important way to achieve high output with low input, develop agricultural productivity, and promote agriculture to a new level. In the near future, special attention should be paid to and focus on the promotion and application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements, with the main content being the increase in grain, cotton, and oilseed yields in large fields. The focus should be on organizing the promotion of comprehensive treatment technologies for medium and low-yield fields, excellent new varieties (including hybrid combinations), optimized cultivation systems for crops, high-yield model cultivation, agricultural technology and machinery matching, optimized formula fertilization, dryland farming, water-saving irrigation, comprehensive treatment of salinization, soil and water conservation, sand control and greening, grassland and slope improvement and treatment, comprehensive prevention and control of diseases, pests, weeds, and rodents, optimized formula feeding, prevention and control of livestock and poultry diseases, series production of livestock and poultry, fast-growing and high-yield timber, shelterbelts, economic forests cultivation, and comprehensive utilization of forest resources, intensive cultivation of marine and freshwater products, and fresh and live commodity storage, as well as processing, preservation, storage, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, and new technologies in fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural films, agricultural machinery, feed processing machinery, etc. Each locality should actively promote and apply scientific and technological achievements that have passed appraisal, and formulate and organize the implementation of different levels of promotion plans according to local conditions. In the future, applicable agricultural scientific and technological achievements should be promptly released and promoted, and gradually form a system.

The planning and agricultural and technological departments at all levels should support the preliminary work of regional trials, production experimental demonstration zones, and the construction of seed bases and comprehensive treatment bases for medium and low-yield fields before the transformation of major research achievements into production. State-owned agricultural, pastoral, and forestry farms and seed farms should play a demonstration role in trials and promotion. Each locality should establish breeding and improvement bases for crop, forest, and livestock and poultry varieties, and do a good job in the renewal, replacement, and purification of crop, forest, and livestock and poultry varieties. To encourage the breeding and promotion of excellent varieties (including seedlings and vaccines), research, education, and promotion units are allowed to operate their own bred and approved excellent varieties legally. Research, education, and promotion units that use seed and vaccine research achievements to form joint ventures with production units can collect technology transfer fees according to regulations, or implement profit-sharing, or take a percentage from the product sales revenue. The funds obtained should be mainly used for the development of new varieties.

2. Establish and Improve Various Forms of Agricultural Technology Promotion and Service Organizations

Whether agricultural science and technology can be transformed into real productive forces depends on timely delivery of advanced and applicable technologies to hundreds of millions of farmers. Localities should further strengthen the construction of the agricultural science and technology promotion service system. While consolidating and developing county-level agricultural technology promotion institutions, they should actively support various professional science and technology associations and technical research associations with farmers as the main body and agricultural technicians and technical personnel as the backbone. Gradually, a network of agricultural technology promotion that combines national agricultural technology promotion institutions with mass agricultural science popularization organizations and farmers' professional technical service organizations should be formed to smooth the channels for the flow of science and technology to every household and every production link. In areas with conditions, socialized and specialized services should be provided to steadily promote moderate-scale management.

The reform within agricultural science and technology promotion institutions at all levels should be actively supported. Appropriate paid services and competition mechanisms should be introduced to gradually change the economic method of relying solely on financial allocations and free services. On the basis of implementing the lump-sum funding of administrative expenses, self-operation should be implemented to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in funds. Through the development of various paid technical services and the establishment of technology-agriculture (industry)-commerce integrated technical economic entities, the sources of funds should be expanded, the accumulation of funds should be increased, and the technical service and self-development capabilities should be enhanced, so that they can gradually develop into technical economic service entities. The state should give tax exemptions to this type of entity.

Agricultural technology group contracting is a new form of agricultural technology promotion in the past two years, mainly to promote applicable agricultural technologies on a large scale in field crops, covering the entire process from pre-production, in-production, to post-production, and providing socialized services with material supply and sales as the basis and comprehensive matching. In group contracting, leadership is the guarantee, technology is the core, and materials are the foundation. Leaders at all levels should take personal responsibility and integrate the departments of finance, banking, materials, commerce (including supply and marketing cooperatives), research, education, and technology promotion to form a large-scale force for the promotion of agricultural science and technology. Attention should be paid to relying on the scientific and technological strength of research institutions and universities in central cities, providing necessary conditions for the promotion of technologies, and encouraging them to enter the field of rural science and technology promotion. The "Law of the People's Republic of China on Technology Contracts" should be strictly implemented, and the interests, risks, and contracting benefits of the contracting party and the contracting party should be closely linked.

3. Further Stabilize and Develop the Rural Science and Technology Team

For a long time, the vast number of rural science and technology workers in China have made great contributions to the development of agricultural production and rural economic construction under extremely difficult working and living conditions. The spirit of hard work, unity, and dedication to the people and the cause should continue to be advocated and carried forward, and the existing agricultural science and technology team should be stabilized and consolidated. More science and technology personnel should be mobilized to go to the front line of agricultural production. Attention should be paid to the off-job training and short-term training of existing rural science and technology personnel to continuously update their knowledge. It should be ensured that rural science and technology personnel have more time to engage in their professional work, and they should generally not be assigned to administrative work unrelated to their profession.

All levels of government should organize the departments of personnel, finance, agriculture, and science and technology management to take effective measures to improve the learning, working conditions, and living treatment of science and technology personnel on the front line of rural production as soon as possible. For technical cadres engaged in rural science and technology promotion work in counties and below, the "Notice of the State Council on the Report of the Ministry of Labor and Personnel and Other Four Departments on Strengthening the Science and Technology Team on the Front Line of Agriculture and Forestry" [Guo Fa (1983) No. 74] should be continued to be implemented, and their concerns should be addressed. The staffing of township and town agricultural technology service institutions should be implemented according to national regulations, and the actual problems of college and university graduates in agriculture (forestry, water conservancy) with indicators and funds assigned by the state plan to work in township-level agricultural (forestry, water conservancy) technology promotion service institutions should be solved from 1990 onwards by the state and local governments sharing the burden. Localities can, in combination with local conditions, implement some preferential policies to encourage agricultural science and technology personnel and seriously fulfill them. Outstanding contributors should be commended and rewarded.

The talent policy should be further liberalized, technical services should be paid for, and contributions should be linked to income. To fully play the role of science and technology personnel in county-level party and government organs, they should be supported or dispatched to engage in paid technical and economic contracting and directly engage in rural science and technology promotion work. Attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating various technical talents from rural educated youth and local experts, and gradually replenishing a large number of technical backbones who can be supported and retained in rural areas.

4. Vigorously Strengthen Rural Education and Widely Carry Out Technical Training

The scientific and cultural level of farmers should be improved, and rural literacy, cultural education, and agricultural science and technology work should be strengthened. The education and technical training of rural laborers should be regarded as an important task and efforts should be made to achieve results. Rural youth are the backbone of the agricultural front. Conditions should be actively created to provide practical technical training and vocational education for junior and senior high school graduates who have not been admitted to higher education. For those with outstanding achievements and levels, rewards should be given, and they can be evaluated for corresponding technical titles and appointed by the township government as farmer technical personnel, technicians, etc.

Localities should accelerate the adjustment of the rural education structure, increase the proportion of vocational schools, and increase the teaching content of agricultural technology. Adult technical education in rural areas should be vigorously developed, and agricultural radio (television), correspondence (publication) schools, farmer night schools, and various training bases should be well run. In combination with the implementation of the "Star Fire," "Wildfire," and "Harvest" plans, practical technical training should be carried out. Colleges and universities and research institutions should make more contributions to cultivating and improving the quality of rural teachers. The role of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the Science and Technology Association, and democratic parties should be continued to be played, and social forces should be relied upon to continuously improve the cultural level of rural laborers. Science and technology newspapers published by local governments and relevant departments facing rural areas are important propaganda tools for disseminating and promoting agricultural scientific and technological achievements, and they should be supported and their role should be fully played.

5. Broadly Open Up Funding Sources and Increase Investment in Agricultural Science and Technology

Relying on scientific and technological progress to develop agriculture requires raising funds from all sides and continuously increasing investment. All levels of government should use the agricultural development fund established according to regulations to focus on agricultural science and technology investment, open up stable funding sources for agricultural research, promotion, and training, and while increasing agricultural basic construction and technological transformation funds, continuously increase agricultural science and technology investment. Various channels for technical promotion funds should be opened up, such as extracting technical improvement fees from the operation links of grain and economic crops such as cotton and oilseeds. National-level comprehensive scientific research plans, scientific funds, and key projects and new technology development projects should all increase investment in agricultural science and technology, and ensure that a certain proportion of funds is used for agricultural scientific research and development projects. Financial, banking, and other financial institutions and agricultural management departments should tilt towards agricultural science and technology when increasing agricultural investment. Special loans or low-interest loans can be arranged for agricultural science and technology achievement promotion and application projects. Foreign investment should be actively introduced, and services and technical cooperation should be provided to make up for the shortage of domestic funds and technology. The collective and agricultural development service economic entities and farmers should be actively encouraged and guided to increase their investment in the application of agricultural science and technology. Some preferential policies should be formulated to help various agricultural technology service organizations improve their fund-raising capabilities and increase their investment in agricultural science and technology achievement promotion projects.

The materials needed for agricultural scientific research and technical promotion should be actively arranged by relevant departments. The chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural films, and agricultural diesel needed for the technical promotion services of county-level agricultural technology promotion institutions can be supplied by agricultural materials wholesale units or directly by factories, and the combination of technology and materials should be implemented to carry out paid services and improve the effect of agricultural science and technology promotion and application and the benefit of material input.

6. Pay Attention to and Do a Good Job in Agricultural High Technology and Basic Research

While vigorously strengthening the promotion of agricultural scientific and technological achievements, it is important to arrange agricultural science and technology in depth, which is an important guarantee for the strength of science and technology to revitalize agriculture. The national "Seventh Five-Year" scientific and technological breakthrough plan must be completed on schedule and ahead of schedule. The "Eighth Five-Year" and medium- and long-term scientific and technological breakthrough plans that are currently being compiled should increase the proportion of agricultural topics and concentrate efforts to solve major scientific and technological problems in agricultural production. The high-tech research and development plan should further emphasize key fields such as agricultural biotechnology, and continuously enrich the content of new variety development research for animals and plants in the rolling plan. All relevant parties should work together to strive to produce a number of breakthrough achievements for the long-term development of agriculture by the end of this century. Basic applied research should also be tilted towards agriculture. The National Natural Science Foundation should take research projects that are of great significance to the sustainable development of agriculture as the focus of future funding.

The relevant departments of the State Council should actively organize the transformation of major research achievements to agricultural production. Localities can, according to needs, arrange some agricultural science and technology experimental projects related to the overall situation in a planned manner, and support a number of major agricultural science and technology achievements in production trials. Attention should be paid to arranging some basic applied research projects, which can be organized by research institutions and colleges and universities to participate in, and attention should be paid to doing a good job in the handover. The new trends in global agricultural development should be closely monitored, and international cooperation and exchanges should be actively carried out to introduce new agricultural technologies, new varieties, and advanced management experience.

7. Strengthen the Leadership of Science and Technology to Revitalize Agriculture

Relying on scientific and technological progress to revitalize agriculture is an important strategic task, and all levels of government should designate a leading comrade to personally take charge of this work and strengthen leadership. Some places have achieved good results by appointing vice-mayors for science and technology, and this should be further summarized and improved. Science and technology to revitalize agriculture should be included in the important agenda, and it should be regularly studied and deployed, and it should be firmly grasped. The departments of agriculture, science and technology, education, planning, finance, banking, taxation, materials, commerce, and personnel should be organized to study and formulate policies and measures to promote agricultural scientific and technological progress, and to organically combine scientific and technological breakthroughs, technological development, and achievement promotion. The departments of agriculture and science and technology should regard it as a major task and concentrate their efforts on the tasks they undertake. The departments of agricultural scientific research and agricultural technology promotion should closely cooperate and strengthen cooperation. The departments of machinery, electronics, chemicals, light industry, commerce, environmental protection, and meteorology should also play their roles in the deep processing of agricultural products, the development of alternative resources, comprehensive utilization, the development of new agricultural production materials, environmental and ecological protection, etc. Localities and relevant departments should, in combination with the formulation of the "Eighth Five-Year" plan, conduct thorough investigations and studies, formulate development plans for science and technology to revitalize agriculture in their regions and industries, and organize and implement them seriously.

Relying on science and technology to revitalize agriculture is a glorious historical mission for all levels of government, relevant departments, and the broad masses of science and technology workers. All levels of government should organize relevant departments to grasp the implementation and continuously summarize experience to ensure that this work is carried out in a solid manner. The broad masses of science and technology personnel should strengthen their sense of responsibility, unite and struggle, and pool their wisdom to make new contributions to the modernization of agriculture.

    国务院作出决定
    依靠科技兴农　推广科技成果
    新华社北京12月8日电　国务院关于依靠科技进步振兴农业加强农业科技成果推广工作的决定
    （一九八九年十一月二十七日）
    农业特别是粮食生产的稳定增长，是整个国民经济发展的基础。农业的发展，一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠投入，但最终还是要靠科学解决问题。特别是在世界范围内科学技术迅速发展的今天，要从根本上解决关系到国家兴衰的农业问题，科技兴农尤为重要。我国人多地少，要解决11亿人口的吃饭问题，必须在提高农业劳动生产率、增加农作物单位面积产量和有效利用资源上下功夫。只有紧紧依靠科技进步，才能实现农业技术改造的深刻变革，我国农业现代化才有希望。因此，各级政府必须把依靠科技进步振兴农业作为一项重大战略措施，坚持不懈地抓下去。当前最主要的任务是，要大力抓好农业科学技术的推广应用工作。各级政府要组织农业（包括林业、水利，下同）、科技、教育、工业、计划、财政、商业、金融等部门和广大干部群众共同奋斗，切实抓出成效。为此，特作如下决定：
    一、大力加强农业科技成果的推广应用
    近十年来，我国重大农业科技成果已达25000多项，但许多尚未得到广泛应用，潜力很大。有组织、有计划地把一大批已经成熟的适用科技成果，大范围、大面积地推广应用，是投入少、产出多，发展农业生产力和促进农业上新台阶的重要途径。近期内，要特别重视和抓好以粮棉油大田增产技术为主要内容的农业科技成果的推广应用。要重点组织推广中低产田综合治理技术，优良新品种（含杂交种组合），农作物优化耕作栽培制度、高产模式化栽培、农艺农机配套，优化配方施肥，旱作农业，节水灌溉、综合治理盐碱、水土保持、防沙治沙、草原、草坡改良治理，病虫草鼠害综合防治，优化配方饲养、畜禽疫病防治、家畜家禽系列化生产，速生丰产用材林、防护林、经济林栽培与森林资源综合利用，海水淡水产品精养和鲜活商品储存，农副产品加工、保鲜、贮藏、运输，以及化肥、农药、农用薄膜、农用机械、饲料加工机械等方面的新技术成果。各地都要积极推广应用已经通过鉴定的科技成果，因地制宜地制定和组织实施不同层次的推广计划。今后，对适用农业科技成果要及时发布、推广，并逐步形成制度。
    各级计划及农业、科技部门要支持重大科研成果向生产转移前的区域性试验、生产实验示范区以及良种基地、中低产田综合治理基地建设等前期基础工作。国营农牧林场、良种场要在试验推广中起示范作用。各地都要建立种养业的品种改良繁育基地，搞好农作物、林木和畜禽品种的更新换代、提纯复壮工作。为了鼓励良种（包括种苗、疫苗）的培育、推广，允许科研、教育、推广单位依法经营自己培育并经过审定的优良品种种子。凡利用种子、疫苗等科研成果，与生产单位联营的科研、教育、推广单位，可按规定收取技术转让费，或实行利润分成，或从产品销售额中提成，所获经费大部分应用于新品种的研制。
    二、建立健全各种形式的农业技术推广服务组织
    农业科学技术能否转化为现实的生产力，关键在于及时地把先进的适用技术送到亿万农民手中。各地要进一步加强农业科技推广服务体系建设，在巩固和发展县（含县，下同）以下农业技术推广机构的同时，积极支持以农民为主体，农民技术员、科技人员为骨干的各种专业科技协会和技术研究会，逐步形成国家农业技术推广机构与群众性的农村科普组织及农民专业技术服务组织相结合的农业技术推广网络，以疏通科技流向千家万户和各生产环节的渠道。并在有条件的地方，为稳妥地推进适度规模经营提供社会化、专业化服务。
    要积极支持各级农业科技推广机构深化内部改革。适当引入有偿服务和竞争机制，逐步改变经济上单靠财政拨款、无偿服务的办法，在实行事业费包干的基础上自主经营，逐步做到经费自理。通过发展多种有偿技术服务和兴办技农（工）贸一体化的技术经济实体，扩大经费来源，增加资金积累，增强技术服务和自我发展能力，使之逐步向技术经济服务实体发展。国家对这类实体，要给予减免税照顾。
    农业技术集团承包是近两年推广农业技术的一种新形式，主要是在大田作物上大面积推广农业适用技术，面向产前、产中、产后全过程，提供以物资供销为依托、综合配套的社会化服务。在集团承包中，领导是保证，技术是核心，物资是基础。各级政府领导要亲自负责，把财政、金融、物资、商业（包括供销社）、科研、教育与技术推广部门融为一体，形成一个大规模推广农业科学技术的整体力量。要注意依靠中心城市科研机构、高等院校的科技力量，提供与推广技术相配套的必要条件，鼓励他们进入农村科技推广领域。要严格执行《中华人民共和国技术合同法》，把承包方和发包方的利益、风险与承包效益紧密挂钩。三、进一步稳定和发展农村科技队伍
    长期以来，我国广大农村科技工作者在工作、生活条件十分艰苦的情况下，为我国农业生产发展和农村经济建设做出了很大贡献。要继续提倡和发扬艰苦奋斗、团结协作和为人民、为事业的奉献精神，稳定和巩固现有农业科技队伍，动员更多的科技人员走向农业生产第一线。要重视现有农村科技人员的脱产进修和短期培训，使其不断更新知识。要保证农村科技人员有更多的时间搞本职工作，一般不要抽调他们搞与专业无关的行政工作。
    各级政府要组织人事、财政、农业、科技管理部门共同采取有效措施，尽快改善农村生产第一线科技人员的学习、工作条件和生活待遇。对在县城以下第一线从事农村科技推广工作的技术干部，要继续贯彻落实《国务院批转劳动人事部等四部门关于加强农林第一线科技队伍的报告的通知》〔国发（1983）74号〕，切实帮助他们解决后顾之忧。要按照国家有关规定，尽快落实乡、镇农业技术服务机构的事业编制。从1990年起，由国家和地方共同分担，解决国家计划内的大、中专农业（林业、水利）院校毕业生带指标、带经费到乡级农业（林业、水利）技术推广服务机构工作的实际问题。各地可结合当地情况，对农业科技人员实施一些优惠鼓励政策，并认真兑现。对贡献突出者，应进行表彰和奖励。
    要进一步放活人才政策，推行技术有偿服务，实行贡献与收入挂钩。为了充分发挥县以下党政机关中科技人员的作用，应支持或选派他们到农村生产第一线进行有偿技术经济承包和直接从事农村科技推广工作。要注意从农村知识青年和乡土能人中发现、培养各类技术人才，逐步为农村充实一大批养得起、留得住的技术骨干。
    四、大力加强农村教育，广泛开展技术培训
    要提高农民科学文化水平，切实加强农村扫盲、文化教育和农业科技工作，把对农村劳动者的文化教育和技术培训作为一项重要任务，努力抓出实效。农村的知识青年，是农业战线的生力军。要积极创造条件，对未升学的初、高中毕业生进行实用技术培训和职业教育。对于成绩和水平突出的，要给予奖励，并可评定相应的技术职称，由乡政府聘任为农民技术员、技师等。
    各地要加快农村教育结构的调整，增加职业中学的比重和农用技术的教学内容。要大力发展农村成人技术教育，办好农业广播（电视）、函（刊）授学校、农民夜校和各种培训基地，结合“星火”、“燎原”、“丰收”等计划的实施，开展实用技术培训。大专院校、科研机构要为培养和提高农村师资素质多做贡献。要继续发挥共青团、妇联、科协等群众团体和民主党派的作用，依靠社会力量，不断提高农村劳动者文化水平。各地创办的面向农村的科技报是传播推广农业科技成果的重要宣传工具，各级政府和有关部门应予支持，充分发挥其作用。五、广辟资金来源，增加农业科技投入
    依靠科技进步发展农业，必须多方筹措资金，不断增加投入。各级政府要把按规定建立的农业发展基金，重点用于农业科技投入，为农业科研、推广和培训开辟稳定的资金来源，并在相应增加农业基本建设和技术改造资金的同时，不断增加农业科技投入，要多方面开辟技术推广资金渠道，如从粮食以及棉花、油料等经济作物经营环节中提取技术改进费。国家级综合性科研计划、科学基金以及攻关项目、新技术开发项目，都要增加对农业科技的投入，保证有相当比例的经费用于农业科研、开发项目。各级财政、银行和其他金融机构以及农业主管部门，在增加农业投入时要向农业科技倾斜。对农业科技成果推广应用项目，可安排专项贷款或低息贷款。要积极引进外资，提供服务和技术合作，以弥补国内资金和技术的不足。要积极鼓励引导集体和农业开发服务经济实体及农民增加对农业科技应用的投入。要制定一些优惠政策，帮助各种农业技术服务组织提高资金积累能力，增加对农业科技成果推广项目的投入。
    农业科研试验和技术推广所需物资，有关部门要积极安排。县以下农业技术推广机构开展技术推广服务所需配套的化肥、农药、农膜、农用柴油等生产资料，可由农资批发单位优先供应或由工厂直接供应，实行技物结合，开展有偿服务，提高农业科技推广应用效果和物资投入效益。
    六、重视并做好农业高技术和基础研究工作
    在大力加强农业科技成果推广的同时，搞好农业科学技术的纵深安排，是增强科技兴农后劲的重要保证。国家“七五”科技攻关计划，一定要按期并力争提前完成。目前正在着手编制的“八五”和中长期科技攻关计划，要增加有关农业课题的比重，集中力量解决农业生产中的重大科技问题。高技术研究发展计划，要进一步突出农业生物技术等重点领域，并在计划滚动中不断充实动植物新品种开发研究等内容。各有关方面要共同努力，争取在本世纪内为农业的长远发展拿出一批有突破性的成果。基础性应用研究也要向农业倾斜。国家自然科学基金会要把对农业持续发展具有重大意义的研究项目，作为今后资助的重点。
    国务院有关部门应积极组织重大科研成果向农业生产上转移。各地可根据需要，有计划地安排一些关系全局的农业科技试验项目，扶持一批重大农业科技成果的生产性试验。要注意安排一定的基础性应用研究项目，可组织科研单位和大专院校参加，并注意做好衔接工作。要密切注视世界农业发展的新动向，积极开展国际合作与交流，引进农业新技术、新品种和先进的管理经验。
    七、切实加强对科技兴农工作的领导
    依靠科技进步振兴农业，是一项带有战略性的重要任务，各级政府要确定一位领导同志亲自抓这项工作，切实加强领导。一些地方配备科技副县长的效果比较好，要进一步总结和完善。要把科技兴农工作列入重要议事日程，经常研究部署，抓紧抓好。要组织农业、科技、教育、计划、财政、金融、税收、物资、商业、人事等部门，抓紧研究和制定推动农业科技进步的政策和措施，把科技攻关、技术开发、成果推广有机地结合起来。农业、科技部门应当把它作为一项主要工作，集中精力抓好所承担的任务。农业科研与农技推广部门要紧密配合，加强协作。机械、电子、化工、轻工、商业、环保、气象等有关部门也要利用各自的科技优势，为农产品深度加工、替代资源开发、综合利用、新农用生产资料开发、环境和生态保护等发挥作用。各地和有关部门要结合“八五”计划的制订，认真调查研究，制订出本地区、本行业科技兴农的发展规划，认真组织实施。
    依靠科学技术振兴农业，是各级政府、各有关部门和广大科技工作者的光荣历史使命。各级政府要组织有关部门狠抓落实，并不断总结经验，使这项工作扎扎实实地开展起来。广大科技人员都要增强责任感，团结奋斗，群策群力，为实现农业现代化做出新的贡献。
