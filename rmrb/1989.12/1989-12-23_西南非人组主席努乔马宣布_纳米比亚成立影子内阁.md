    西南非人组主席努乔马宣布
    纳米比亚成立影子内阁
    新华社温得和克12月21日电　西南非洲人民组织（人组）主席努乔马今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上宣布，人组决定成立一个由一名执行总统和一名总理领导的、有16名成员组成的影子内阁。
    努乔马说，这一决定是人组中央委员会和政治局在一次会议上作出的。他说，人组领导机构决定为独立的纳米比亚建立第一个政府。
    但是目前影子内阁中的总理和16名部长中的2名部长的人选还没有定下来。
    在已选定的14名部长中，外交部长由人组负责外交事务的书记西奥本·古里拉布担任，新闻和广播部长由人组新闻书记希迪波·哈穆泰尼亚担任。
    早些时候被选为制宪议会主席的人组竞选委员会主任哈格·根哥布将在纳米比亚明年第一季度宣布独立后，全面负责公共事务。
    此外，纳米比亚全国阵线和联合民主阵线的领导人也被任命为这个影子内阁的副部长。
    在联合国有效地监督下，纳米比亚于11月7日至11日进行了制宪议会大选，人组以41席的多数获胜。
