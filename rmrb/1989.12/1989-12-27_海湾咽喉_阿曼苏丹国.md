Edition: 4

The Sultanate of Oman is located in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. To the northeast, it borders the Gulf of Oman, and to the southeast, it faces the Arabian Sea. Its northern end is separated from Iran by the Strait of Hormuz, which controls the gateway from the Gulf to the Indian Ocean. The shipping route from the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz to Western Europe, Japan, and the United States is known as the "lifeline" of the West. Oman, located on the southern side of this "lifeline" at the Strait of Hormuz, holds a strategically important position.

Oman covers an area of 300,000 square kilometers, with a population of 1.5 million. The majority are Arabs, and they practice Islam. The official language is Arabic, and English is widely spoken. The capital is Muscat.

Most of Oman is a plateau with an elevation of 200 to 500 meters. Except for the mountainous northeastern region, the rest of the country has a hot desert climate. Oman has abundant oil resources, but before 1970, its economy was very backward. After Sultan Qaboos took power in July 1970, he implemented a series of economic development measures. The oil industry developed rapidly, making Oman an important producer and exporter of oil and natural gas in the Gulf region. It also used its oil revenues to vigorously develop transportation, construction, and other basic industries. In 1976, Oman began implementing its first five-year plan. In the current third five-year plan, Oman's basic economic policy is to "diversify" the economy, focusing on developing other national resources, emphasizing the development of agriculture, water conservancy, fisheries, and social services. Oman's main crops include wheat, barley, dates, frankincense, and red and white cotton.

The Sultanate of Oman was established in the mid-18th century and became one of the strongest nations in the Indian Ocean at that time. Although China and Oman are separated by vast oceans, friendly exchanges between the two countries have a long history. In the mid-8th century, the Omani navigator Abu Ubayda sailed to Guangzhou in China. In the 15th century, during the Ming Dynasty's Yongle era, Zheng He visited Oman twice during his seven voyages to the Western Seas. Oman also sent envoys to China during the Yongle and Xuande eras. Since establishing diplomatic relations in May 1978, China and Oman have seen significant developments in their relationship. The two countries have signed trade agreements, news, cultural, and health agreements, and aviation agreements. Government officials from both countries have visited each other multiple times.

    海湾咽喉——阿曼苏丹国
    阿曼苏丹国位于阿拉伯半岛东南部。东北濒阿曼湾，东南临阿拉伯海，其北端隔霍尔木兹海峡与伊朗相望，扼海湾通往印度洋的门户。从海湾经霍尔木兹海峡通往西欧、日本和美国的这条航线被称为西方的“生命线”，位于这条“生命线”的咽喉霍尔木兹海峡南侧的阿曼，战略地位异常重要。
    阿曼的面积为30万平方公里，人口150万，大多数是阿拉伯人，信伊斯兰教，官方语言为阿拉伯语，通用英语。首都马斯喀特。
    阿曼境内大部分是海拔200米至500米的高原。除东北部山地外，均属热带沙漠气候。石油资源比较丰富，但在1970年以前阿曼经济十分落后。1970年7月卡布斯苏丹执政后，采取了一系列发展经济的措施，石油工业发展较快，使阿曼成为海湾地区重要的石油和天然气的生产出口国之一，并利用石油收入，大力发展交通运输、建筑等基础工业。1976年，阿曼开始执行第一个5年计划。在目前的第三个5年计划中，阿曼发展经济的基本方针是使经济“多样化”，注重开发本国其它资源，注重发展农业、水利、渔业和社会服务业等。阿曼的主要农作物有小麦、大麦、椰枣、乳香和红、白两色棉花。
    阿曼苏丹国于18世纪中叶建立王国，成为当时印度洋上最强盛的国家之一。中、阿两国虽远隔重洋，两国间的友好往来却源远流长。8世纪中叶，阿曼航海家阿布·奥贝达曾远航到我国的广州。15世纪，中国明朝永乐年间，郑和七下西洋时，曾两次访问过阿曼，阿曼于永乐及宣德年间也曾遣使中国。中、阿自1978年5月建交以来，两国关系有了很大发展。双方先后签订了贸易协定、新闻文化卫生协定和民航协定，两国政府官员曾多次互访。　·宝兰·
