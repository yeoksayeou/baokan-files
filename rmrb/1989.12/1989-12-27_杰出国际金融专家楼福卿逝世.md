Renowned international financial expert Lou Fuchen passed away.

New China News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: Member of the 6th and 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Standing Director of the Board of China Bank, former manager of the London branch of China Bank, and advisor to China Bank, Comrade Lou Fuchen, passed away in Beijing on December 20, 1989, at the age of 81 due to illness.

Lou Fuchen was born in Shanghai in August 1908. He graduated from the Department of Economics at Tsinghua University in 1929 and joined China Bank in 1931. He served in various positions at China Bank's branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Jakarta, London, and other locations both domestically and internationally.

Lou Fuchen was a loyal patriot. After the founding of New China, he served as the deputy manager of the London branch of China Bank. In response to Premier Zhou Enlai's directive to protect state assets, he organized employees to safeguard the bank and prepare for the uprising when the main leadership hesitated. On January 8, 1950, he organized all employees to send a telegram to the headquarters of China Bank, accepting the leadership of New China. As the main organizer and leader of the London branch's uprising, Lou Fuchen not only protected the state's foreign exchange assets but also had a positive influence on other overseas institutions returning to the motherland. His patriotic actions were praised multiple times by the Party and national leaders.

Lou Fuchen was an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, with a deep commitment to communism. He joined the Party at the age of 70 after longing to do so for many years, but his belief in communism never wavered. Lou Fuchen was a distinguished international financial expert and banker in China. He dedicated nearly 60 years to banking, was well-versed in international financial theory and banking practices, and made significant contributions to making the London branch a settlement center for New China, ensuring the normal development of New China's foreign economic relations. He devoted his entire life to the international financial cause of the motherland.

Lou Fuchen was strict with himself and lived a simple life. After returning to the country in 1964, he repeatedly requested to have his salary reduced to the domestic cadre standard. Premier Zhou personally intervened and set his salary. To support the country's construction, he repeatedly requested and in 1981 donated 150,000 yuan, his savings over many years, to the organization. Before his death, he left a will stating that his funeral should be simple, with no memorial service or funeral ceremony; his organs should be donated to the hospital; and his ashes should be scattered inside and outside the Great Wall. Lou Fuchen selflessly dedicated everything to the motherland and the people. His patriotism will forever be remembered.
