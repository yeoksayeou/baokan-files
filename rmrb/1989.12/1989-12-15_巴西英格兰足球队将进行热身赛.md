Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th: According to foreign reports, the England football team hopes to play against Brazil, which has won the World Cup three times, next spring as a warm-up match before the World Cup finals in Italy next year.

Brazil has proposed to visit London on February 21st next year, but the England team cannot play on that day.

The English Football Association hopes that Brazil can play on March 28th next year, as the original plan for the England team to go to Dublin for a friendly match on that day has been canceled.

In next year's World Cup finals, Brazil will be in Group C with Sweden, Costa Rica, and Scotland. Brazil hopes to learn more about the style of play similar to England's through this warm-up match with England. The England team will play warm-up matches with two other teams that have qualified for the World Cup finals, Czechoslovakia and Uruguay, in April and May next year.
