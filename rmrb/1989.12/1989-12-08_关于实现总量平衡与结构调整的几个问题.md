The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party has proposed the main objectives for further rectification and restructuring. In my understanding, this includes both the requirement to achieve overall balance and the task of structural adjustment. The former mainly refers to gradually reducing the inflation rate, curbing excessive monetary issuance, achieving fiscal balance, and maintaining a moderate economic growth rate. The latter mainly refers to adjusting the irrational state of the industrial structure, striving for gradual growth in major agricultural products, and gradually alleviating the contradictions in energy, raw materials, and transportation capacity.

Achieving overall balance while adjusting the economic structure to make it more rational and optimized has always been a fundamental goal of China's macroeconomic management. To maintain overall balance, it is particularly important to control social total demand, with a focus on controlling social final demand, that is, investment demand and consumption demand. Structural adjustment mainly involves adjusting the economic structure, including ownership, income distribution, consumption demand, industrial composition, investment composition, and regional structure. The core of this is adjusting the industrial structure. Only by effectively controlling investment and consumption demand and improving the industrial structure can we overcome the difficulties in China's economic development and ensure that the national economy moves towards sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

It is necessary to fully recognize the difficulties in controlling the total amount and adjusting the structure.

In China's economic construction, there have been two major adjustments: one in the 1960s and one in the early 1980s. These two economic adjustments, through controlling the total amount and structural adjustment, have achieved significant results and accumulated valuable experience. Starting from this year, it will take three years or more to further implement the policy of rectification and restructuring, and deepening reform as determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress. In essence, this is a new adjustment to be carried out under the new situation of reform and opening up. This adjustment has encountered many new situations, new problems, and difficulties. If the economic adjustment in the early 1980s mainly solved the problem of total imbalance caused by excessive investment demand, then this economic adjustment not only needs to solve the problem of investment demand expansion but also needs to solve the problem of rapid growth in consumption demand. This time, the dual expansion of investment and consumption demand is to a large extent supported by fiscal and credit deficits, which is no longer sustainable. If the economic adjustment in the early 1980s was carried out under the condition of relatively stable prices, then this adjustment was started under the condition of inflation and significant price increases. The huge purchasing power and monetary circulation volume are constantly threatening the balance of supply and demand. Whether for controlling the total amount or for structural adjustment, this is a real problem. If the economic adjustment in the early 1980s mainly involved curbing the rapid growth of heavy industry and promoting agriculture and light industry, then this adjustment involves curbing the expansion of general processing industries and strengthening agriculture and basic industries, especially energy, basic raw materials, and transportation construction. The difficulty is much greater. Since 1985, agricultural growth has been slow, and grain production has stagnated. In the future, to accelerate agricultural development, in addition to taking other measures, it is also necessary to increase investment in agriculture and promote the relatively rapid development of agriculture-supporting industries. Here, the difficulty of capital shortage is encountered. In recent years, the growth rate of China's energy industry and basic raw materials industry is not slow, but due to the rapid expansion of general processing industries driven by the expansion of consumption demand, the contradiction between the two has become more acute than ever. Transportation capacity is also in a state of overall tension. The investment required for basic industries is huge, the construction period is long, and due to price distortions, profits are low and investment risks are high. This is significantly different from the early 1980s when the policy of "six priorities" was adopted to quickly develop light industry with low investment thresholds and short construction periods. It is necessary to solve many problems and difficulties. If the economic adjustment in the early 1980s was still carried out under a relatively closed internal circulation, rural reforms had just begun, urban reforms were in the pilot stage, the scope of opening up to the outside world was limited, and the pattern of economic interest subjects was far less complex than it is today; now the pattern of diversified economic interest subjects has formed, and touching the existing interest pattern will inevitably involve all aspects. It is also necessary to handle the relationship between the benign circulation of the domestic economy and opening up to the outside world, both adhering to self-reliance and effectively participating in international exchange and competition. Only when the majority of cadres and the masses, especially leading cadres at all levels, have a full understanding of the above problems and difficulties, can they unify their thinking, make up their minds, and take targeted and decisive measures to control the total amount, adjust the structure, and complete the arduous task of rectification and restructuring and deepening reform.

Under the premise of effectively controlling the total amount, structural adjustment should be carried out.

In economic life, total imbalance and structural imbalance are often twin sisters. Under the condition of total imbalance, the structure generally appears irrational and even deteriorates; structural irrationality and even deterioration not only make the total balance lose a solid foundation but also will sooner or later rebound to the total amount, making it shift from balance to imbalance. However, from the perspective of their impact on economic life, they are not exactly the same in a certain period. Severe total imbalance will cause economic turbulence in a short period, mainly manifested as inflation and significant price increases. Structural imbalance has a gradual impact on economic life, and only when it accumulates to a certain extent will it cause economic turbulence. This is not to say that structural imbalance can be ignored, but rather that when structural imbalance reaches a sharp level, it will combine with total imbalance to have a very unfavorable impact on economic life. Seriously considering this situation and correctly handling the relationship between controlling the total amount and adjusting the structure is crucial.

First of all, it should be seen that in economic adjustment, it is not easy to simply think that controlling the total amount is a relatively easy task, and the main difficulty lies in adjusting the structure. If social total demand cannot be controlled, the supply-demand gap will continue to expand, and inflation will not be effectively curbed, and the price increase rate will remain high, making the entire economy difficult to stabilize. If the price increase rate falls not by increasing effective supply and compressing demand but by large-scale fiscal subsidies, it is equivalent to transferring the contradiction to the fiscal side, and in the end, it will rebound to the price, making the falling price index rise again. At the same time, from the perspective of compressing investment demand and consumption demand, the difficulty of controlling the total amount is also considerable. Rapid growth in investment demand not only causes capital tension and insufficient supply of investment goods but also, after completion, may cause idle production capacity due to the lack of guarantee of energy, raw materials, etc.; and part of the investment (about 40% in China) will directly or indirectly be converted into consumption demand, which will further promote the expansion of the entire consumption demand. Therefore, it is necessary to compress investment. However, if investment is compressed indiscriminately, it will not guarantee the needs of key construction projects, key products, and key enterprises of the state, directly affecting the momentum of national economic development. As for controlling consumption demand, the difficulty is even greater, and there is no need to elaborate. If domestic and foreign economic exchanges are taken into account, the difficulty of controlling the total amount will be more obvious. Due to the current state of the domestic industrial structure, the elasticity of import compression is not very large, and it is necessary to appropriately compress imports during the economic adjustment period to change the situation in recent years of using a large number of imported production materials to support the super-high-speed growth of industry. It is not easy to achieve this.

Secondly, it is not easy to simply think that controlling the total amount is only aimed at the short-term development of the economy, and adjusting the structure is aimed at the future development of the economy. Indeed, severe total imbalance requires us to take decisive measures to solve it in a not too long period; however, the basic focus of solving total imbalance is to achieve the long-term stable development of the national economy, and the problem of total imbalance is not solved, and structural adjustment will also be difficult to make substantive progress. The long-line products that need to be adjusted continue to exist and even gain considerable development due to the existence of excessive demand; the short-line products that need to be supported and increased production are even more insufficient due to the rapid growth of demand, and the bottleneck constraint is not only not alleviated but is even strengthened. Therefore, from a short-term perspective, controlling the total amount is a prerequisite for structural adjustment, and from a long-term perspective, controlling the total amount and adjusting the structure must be carried out in a complementary manner. The longer the time required for structural adjustment, the more it is necessary to frequently control the total amount. Only in this way can the industrial structure gradually move towards overall rationality and optimization.

Finally, it is not easy to think that controlling the total amount is only to solve the shallow-level contradictions in economic life, and adjusting the structure is to solve the deep-level contradictions in economic life. Indeed, there are contradictions in economic life that people can intuitively perceive, such as the supply and demand status of products and the shortage of funds; similarly, there are deep-level contradictions in economic life, which are fundamental contradictions that affect the overall situation and long-term development of the economy, and can only be grasped through analysis and research. In China's economic life, population and agriculture, agriculture and industry, basic industry and processing industry, introduced industry and domestic existing industry, export industry and foreign exchange for imports, as well as the regional distribution of industries, seem to belong to deep-level contradictions. Deep-level contradictions have both total and structural aspects, and only by combining controlling the total amount with adjusting the structure, coordinating with each other, and working together can these be gradually solved. Now some deep-level contradictions have been exposed, and some are still latent, posing a potential threat to the sustained and stable development of the economy, which must be highly valued. It is not realistic to expect to solve all these deep-level contradictions in this economic adjustment, but it is possible and necessary to make some contradictions obtain partial solutions and other contradictions obtain relief through efforts. In short, through the analysis of the current economic situation, make a realistic assessment, start from the shallow-level contradictions, find the deep-level contradictions, and work from the two aspects of controlling the total amount and adjusting the structure to carry out economic adjustment and achieve the expected goals.

Controlling the total amount and adjusting the structure should be based on improving economic efficiency.

Controlling the total amount should be conducive to structural adjustment, and structural adjustment should help to achieve total balance, rather than neglecting one for the other and conflicting with each other. To achieve this, improving economic efficiency is the key. In the economic adjustment, while the growth rate of industry gradually returns to a normal level, it is necessary to use the improved economic efficiency to solve various contradictions and difficulties, especially to make up for the reduction in fiscal revenue caused by the decline in speed. We should seize this opportunity to promote China's economy from a speed-oriented type to an efficiency-oriented type, truly embedding speed in efficiency, and establishing the growth of China's fiscal revenue on the basis of improving economic efficiency. To implement the principle of economic efficiency, it is necessary to support the production of products with good economic efficiency and those necessary for the long-term development of the national economy in terms of funds, energy, raw materials, etc., and promote their rapid development; for the production of products with poor economic efficiency and those not needed for the long-term development of the national economy, some need to be promoted to convert production through various means, and some need to be eliminated. Otherwise, China's capital shortage, energy, raw materials, and transportation capacity shortage situation will not be fundamentally reversed, and the production and construction of key products, key enterprises, and key projects will not be effectively guaranteed and strengthened.

Implementing the principle of economic efficiency is fundamentally to promote technological progress, and at the same time, it is necessary to greatly improve management and reduce waste. There is great potential in this aspect, and it is especially important to improve and enhance structural efficiency during the economic adjustment period. Structural efficiency is overall efficiency. Improving and enhancing structural efficiency not only depends on whether the proportional relationship between industries is reasonable but more depends on whether the weak links that constrain the development of the national economy are strengthened. From the perspective of China's situation, agriculture, basic industries, and transportation industries are the key links and focus for improving and enhancing structural efficiency. Strengthening the construction of these industries requires measures from multiple aspects, and the most prominent is to solve the difficulties of capital shortage and insufficient investment. To increase investment, first, it is necessary to rely on the increment of funds, that is, to extract the expanded reproduction fund from the newly increased profits. However, some industries have already suffered overall losses, and it is difficult to maintain simple reproduction, let alone discuss the addition of expanded reproduction investment. Second, it is necessary to rely on the adjustment of the stock of funds, making the existing social stock of funds tilt towards these industries, but this is constrained by various interests and cannot be tilted overnight. Third, it is necessary to rely on national fiscal investment, and under the current situation of tight national finances, increasing investment in weak links must reduce investment in other aspects, which also encounters the difficulty of ineffective investment tilting. Currently, it is only possible to find a way out of the difficulties. Comparatively speaking, it is still necessary to decide to adjust the stock, which is the main aspect, and at the same time, tilt the increment (due to the limited quantity, it may not play a major role) to solve the problem of insufficient fund investment in weak links. This will inevitably touch the existing economic interest pattern, and the essence and true difficulty of rectification and restructuring also lie here. Therefore, during the rectification and restructuring, on the one hand, it is necessary to pay attention to the stability and continuity of policies to avoid large vibrations when touching the interest pattern, and on the other hand, it is necessary to adjust the necessary parts that cannot be adjusted, to ensure the implementation of the goals and measures of rectification and restructuring. This requires strengthening centralized management during the rectification and restructuring period on the basis of giving full play to the initiative of local and enterprise units, requiring strengthening planning, appropriately strengthening and improving directive planning, and improving the implementation methods of indicative planning. The plan should strive to have an economic basis, and in the process of implementing the plan, economic measures should be used as much as possible, and administrative measures should be used less or even not used, to create conditions for establishing a macro-control system that comprehensively uses various regulatory means.

    关于实现总量平衡与结构调整的几个问题
    王积业
    党的十三届五中全会提出了进一步治理整顿的主要目标。我理解，这里既有实现总量平衡的要求，又有调整结构的任务。前者主要是指逐步降低通货膨胀率，转扭货币超经济发行，实现财政收支平衡，保持适度经济增长率等；后者主要是指调整产业结构的不合理状况，力争主要农产品逐步增长，能源原材料和运力不足的矛盾逐步缓解。
    实现总量平衡，同时调整好经济结构，使之逐步合理和优化，历来是我国宏观经济管理的基本目标。为了保持总量平衡，特别要控制社会总需求，其中尤以控制社会最终需求，即投资需求和消费需求为重点。调整结构，主要是调整包括所有制、收入分配、消费需求、产业构成和投资构成以及地区结构在内的经济结构，其核心环节是调整产业结构。投资和消费需求得到有效控制，产业结构得到改善，才能克服我国经济前进中的困难，使国民经济走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。
    要充分认识控制总量和调整结构的难度
    我国经济建设中，曾出现过两次大的调整，一次是在六十年代，一次是在八十年代初期。这两次经济调整，通过控制总量和结构调整，都取得了显著的成效，积累了丰富宝贵的经验。从今年起用三年或者更多一些时间进一步贯彻党的十三大确定的治理整顿、深化改革的方针，实质上是要在改革开放的新形势下进行的一次新的调整。这次调整出现了许多新情况，遇到了新的问题和困难。如果说八十年代初期的经济调整，所要解决的总量失衡主要是由投资需求过大引起的，那么这次经济调整不仅要解决投资需求膨胀，同时还要解决消费需求增长过快的问题。这次投资和消费需求双膨胀，在相当大的程度上是靠财政和信贷赤字来支撑的，已经难以为继。如果说八十年代初期的经济调整是在物价基本稳定的情况下进行的，那么这次经济调整是在通货膨胀、物价大幅度上涨的情况下起步的，巨大的结余购买力和货币流通量，时刻都在威胁市场供求平衡，无论对于控制总量还是对于调整结构，它都是一个实实在在的难题。如果说八十年代初期的经济调整，主要是压缩重工业的过快增长，把农业和轻工业搞上去，那么这次经济调整则是要压缩一般加工业的膨胀势头，大力加强农业和基础工业，特别是能源、基础原材料和交通运输的建设，难度要大的多。农业自1985年以后增长缓慢，粮食生产徘徊不前，今后要加快农业发展，除了采取其他措施外，还要求增加对农业的投入，要求支农工业有较快的发展，这里又遇到了资金短缺的困难。近几年我国能源工业和基础原材料工业增长速度并不算慢，但由于受消费需求膨胀牵动的一般加工业的迅猛扩张，使得两者的矛盾比以往任何时期都尖锐了。运力也处于全面紧张的困境中。基础工业投资所需要的资金数量很多，建设周期又长，而且因价格扭曲所带来的利润低，投资风险大。这同八十年代初期，采取“六个优先”的政策，在比较短的时间里就把投资门槛低、建设周期短的轻工搞了上去相比，有明显的不同，需要解决多方面的问题和困难。如果说八十年代初期的经济调整还是在相对封闭的内循环状态下进行的，农村改革刚刚起步，城市改革处于试点阶段，对外开放的范围有限，经济利益主体的格局远不如今天这样复杂；那么现在利益主体多元化的格局已经形成，而触动现存利益格局，势必涉及方方面面。还要处理好国内经济良性循环与对外开放的关系，既坚持自力更生，又能有成效地参加国际交换和国际竞争。只有广大干部群众特别是各级领导干部对上述问题和困难有了充分的估计，才能统一认识，痛下决心，有针对性地采取果敢措施，控制住总量，调整好结构，完成治理整顿、深化改革的艰巨任务。
    在有效控制总量前提下搞好结构调整
    在经济生活中，总量失衡和结构失衡往往是孪生姐妹。在总量失衡的情况下，结构一般呈现不合理甚至趋于恶化；结构不合理乃至恶化，不仅使总量平衡失去牢固的基础，而且或迟或早会反弹到总量上面，使它从平衡转为失衡。然而从两者对经济生活的影响来看，在一定时间内并不完全相同。总量严重失衡在短时期内就会引起经济的巨烈振荡，集中表现为通货膨胀，物价大幅度上涨。结构失衡对经济生活的影响则具有渐近性的特点，只有积累到一定程度，才会引起经济生活的巨烈振荡。这决不是说可以轻视结构失衡，而是说结构失衡达到尖锐的程度时，会同总量失衡结合在一起对经济生活产生极为不利的影响。认真考虑这种情况，正确处理控制总量和调整结构的关系，是至关重要的。
    首先应该看到，经济调整中不能简单地认为控制总量是比较容易办到的事情，主要困难在于调整结构。如果社会总需求控制不住，供求缺口继续扩大，通货膨胀就得不到有效治理，物价上涨幅度势必居高不下，整个经济也就难以稳定下来。如果物价上涨幅度回落不是靠增加有效供给和压缩需求，而是靠财政大量补贴，那无异于把矛盾转嫁到财政上面，到头来还会反弹给物价，使趋于下降的物价指数重新升高。同时，从压缩投资需求和消费需求来看，控制总量的难度也是相当大的。投资需求增长过快，不仅造成资金紧张和投资品供给不足，而且建成后还会因能源、原材料等得不到保证，造成生产能力的闲置；并且投资中有一部分（在我国大约占40％左右）要直接或间接地转化为消费需求，这又会推动整个消费需求的扩张。因此压缩投资势在必行。然而如果无区别地压缩，就保证不了国家重点建设、重点产品、重点企业的需要，直接影响国民经济发展的后劲。至于控制消费需求，难度更大，无需多说。如果把对外经济往来考虑在内，控制总量的难度就更为明显。由于国内产业结构的现状所决定，压缩进口的弹性并不很大，而在经济调整时期又必须适当压缩进口，改变近几年来用进口大量生产资料来支撑工业超高速增长的局面。做到这一点实非容易。
    其次，不能简单地认为控制总量只是着眼于经济的近期发展，调整结构才是着眼于经济发展的未来。诚然，总量严重失衡，要求我们采取坚决措施在不太长的时间加以解决；可是解决总量失衡的基本着眼点，却在于实现国民经济的长期稳定发展，而且总量失衡问题不解决，结构调整也难以取得实质性进展。需要调整的长线产品，由于存在着过旺的需求而得以继续存在，乃至获得相当的发展，需要扶植和大力增产的短线产品，由于需求增长过快而显得更加不足，从而瓶颈约束不仅得不到缓解，反而有所强化。所以说，从短期看，控制总量是调整结构的前提条件，从长期看，控制总量和调整结构总是要相辅相成地进行。调整结构需要的时间越长，越要求经常地控制住总量。只有这样，产业结构才有条件逐步走向全面合理和优化。
    最后，不能认为控制总量只是解决经济生活中的浅层次矛盾，调整结构才是解决经济生活中的深层次矛盾。的确，经济生活中存在人们直观就可以觉察到的矛盾，如产品的供求状况、资金短缺情况等；同样，经济生活中也存在着深层次的矛盾，它是影响经济全局和长远发展的一些根本性矛盾，需要通过分析研究方有可能加以把握。我国经济生活中人口与农业、农业与工业、基础工业与加工工业、引进产业与国内原有产业、出口产业与进口用汇，以及产业的地区分布等，似应属于深层次矛盾。深层次矛盾既有总量方面的也有结构方面的，只有把控制总量与调整结构结合起来，互相配合，共同努力，才能逐步解决。现在有些深层次矛盾陆续暴露出来，有的还在潜伏着，构成对经济持续稳定发展的潜在威胁，必须高度重视。在这次经济调整中设想全部解决这些深层次矛盾是不现实的，但使某些矛盾得到局部解决，使另一些矛盾得到缓解，却是经过努力可以而且应当做到的。总之要通过当前经济形势的分析，做出实事求是的估量，从浅层次矛盾入手，找出深层次矛盾，从控制总量和调整结构两个方面进行，才能搞好经济调整，实现预期目标。
    控制总量调整结构要立足于提高经济效益
    控制总量应当有利于结构调整，结构调整要有助于总量平衡，而不是顾此失彼，互相冲突。为了做到这一点，提高经济效益就是关键所在。在经济调整中，在工业增长速度逐步回落到正常水平的同时，要用得到提高的经济效益来解决诸多矛盾和困难，特别是弥补因速度回落而产生的财政收入的减少。我们应当趁此时机促使我国经济从速度型转向效益型，真正把速度寓于效益之中，使我国财政收入的增长建立在提高经济效益的基础之上。为了实行经济效益原则，要对经济效益好和为国民经济长远发展所必需的产品的生产，从资金、能源、原材料等方面加以大力扶持，促使其加快发展；对效益差和不为国民经济长远发展所需要的产品的生产，有的要运用多种手段促使其转产，有的要加以淘汰。不这样，我国资金紧张、能源、原材料和运力不足的局面就无法根本扭转，重点产品、重点企业、重点项目的生产和建设也得不到切实的保证和加强。
    实行经济效益原则，最根本的是推进技术进步，同时要大力改善经营管理，减少浪费，这方面的潜力很大，而在经济调整时期尤其要注意改善和提高结构效益。结构效益是整体效益，改善和提高结构效益不仅取决于产业间的比例关系是否合理，更取决于制约国民经济发展的薄弱环节是否得到加强。从我国情况来看，农业、基础工业和运输业等正是改善和提高结构效益的关键环节，是重点所在。加强这些产业的建设，需要从多方面采取措施，而突出的是要解决资金短缺、投入不足的困难。要增加投入，一是靠资金增量，即从新增利润中提取扩大再生产基金。然而有些行业已经发生全面亏损，简单再生产尚难维持，追加扩大再生产投资无从谈起。二是靠资金存量调整，使现有社会资金存量向这些产业倾斜，这又受到方方面面利益关系的制约，一下子难以倾斜过来。三是靠国家财政投资，在国家财力紧张的现状下，增加薄弱环节的投资，必须削减其他方面投资，这同样遇到投资难以有效倾斜的困难。当前，只能从困难中找出路。比较起来，还是要下决心搞存量调整，这是主要的，同时搞增量倾斜（由于数量有限可能起不了主要作用），来解决薄弱环节的资金投入不足问题。这势必触及现存经济利益格局，治理整顿、深化改革的实质和真正困难也在于此。所以，在治理整顿中，一方面要注意政策的稳定性和连续性，避免在触动利益格局时发生大的振动，一方面对非调整不可的部分要进行必要的调整，以保证治理整顿目标和措施的落实。这就要求在治理整顿期间，宏观管理在发挥地方、企业积极性的基础上适当加强集中，要求加强计划性，适当强化与改进指令性计划，完善指导性计划的实施办法。计划要力求有经济依据，实施计划的过程中，能用经济办法的尽量少用乃至不用行政办法，为建立综合运用各种调节手段的宏观调控体系创造条件。
