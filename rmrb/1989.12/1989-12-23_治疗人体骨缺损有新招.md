Reporter Meng Xian reports from Xi'an: Treating bone defects no longer requires autologous bone grafting surgery. For the first time domestically and internationally, bone morphogenetic protein has been extracted from bovine bone for the treatment of human bone defects. Additionally, a monoclonal antibody for the active site of bBMP has been successfully developed in Xi'an and recently passed a ministerial-level appraisal.

Bone morphogenetic protein has traditionally been extracted from human bone, but this process is difficult and expensive. The Fourth Military Medical University's School of Stomatology, in collaboration with the Xijing Hospital and the PLA Institute of Digestive Diseases, successfully extracted bone morphogenetic protein from inexpensive bovine bone for the first time. They also used bovine bone ceramics as a bone graft substitute in clinical applications, achieving success.

    治疗人体骨缺损有新招
    本报西安12月21日电　记者孟西安报道：治疗骨缺损可以不做自体骨移植手术了——国内外首次从牛骨中提取骨形成蛋白用于人体骨缺损治疗，并制备出骨形成蛋白活性位点的bBMP单克隆抗体，在西安获得成功，日前通过了部级鉴定。
    骨形成蛋白过去一直是从人骨中提取出来，但这种物质提取困难，价格昂贵。第四军医大学口腔医学院在该校西京医院和全军消化研究中心首次从价格低廉的牛骨中提取骨形成蛋白，并用牛骨陶瓷化骨代替人骨作为骨移植材料，用于临床，获得成功。
