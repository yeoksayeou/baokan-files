Ah, Shanghai Goods – A Side Note on the National Light Industry Excellent New Product Exhibition and Evaluation Fair

People's Daily reporter Liú Guìlián

Shanghai goods, trendy items, fashionable goods. Many people have this impression.

In China's light industrial products, every four watches, one is made in Shanghai; every three tubes of toothpaste, one is from Shanghai; every six bicycles, one is a "Forever" brand... On December 22, the National Light Industry Excellent New Product Exhibition and Evaluation Fair opened at the newly completed China International Trade Center. Shanghai, the largest light industrial base in China, formed a large delegation, bringing nearly a thousand new products to participate in the exhibition and inviting experts and consumers to evaluate them.

Using "a cluster of fine products and abundant results" to describe Shanghai's new products developed through technological progress may not be an exaggeration. At the exhibition stand, there are products that use new technologies and high technologies to enhance export earnings, such as the "Forever" brand road racing bicycle, the "Phoenix" brand sports bicycle, fully transparent and hollow mechanical men's and women's watches, high-speed flat-seam machines; there are high-value-added, high-technology combinations such as computer drawing devices, multi-head embroidery machines, large-screen news bulletin systems; and more are daily new products targeting market gaps and consumer hotspots, such as car-engraved crystal glassware, eagle-beak pressure-insulated thermos bottles, all-plastic coffee pots, high-end cosmetics sets, art watches, dual-calendar electronic watches, arch-shaped watches, couple watches... At the small hardware counter, staff introduced that the Shanghai-made flameless lighters, which are on par with imports, sell for over 60 yuan in the Shanghai market, while imported ones sell for over 100 yuan; dual-head electric shavers, imported ones sell for 269 yuan, while Shanghai-made ones sell for 48 yuan.

High craftsmanship, exquisite product design, reliable quality, and reasonable prices—this has been the evaluation of Shanghai goods in the past. Those familiar with Shanghai products can list a series of old brand-name products, which are still popular today. In recent years, Shanghai's new light industrial products that are well-known nationwide seem to be fewer. The advantages of Shanghai goods seem to be declining.

Shanghai's light industry has now taken a new step in fierce competition.

Compared to some regions, Shanghai's light industrial enterprises bear heavier burdens, have less investment, and face greater difficulties in changing their appearance. But Shanghai also has its own advantages. As an old light industrial base, it has strong technological strength, high enterprise management levels, and strong capabilities in developing new products and coordinated cooperation. They have taken the path of mainly relying on introducing and digesting foreign technologies and developing their own products based on their advantages. Take the quartz electronic watches developed in recent years as an example. On the basis of absorbing foreign technologies and introducing some key equipment, they have successfully developed their own products from the movement, case, dial, to the hands and straps, making the styles and colors change from only 20 kinds per year to 200 kinds per year, not only changing quickly but also at a lower price. The technological strength and scale of Shanghai's household chemical industry are the best in the country. The cosmetics series they developed, such as Lu Mei, Mei Jia Jing, Ai Luo Li, and Bo Long, have their own characteristics compared to foreign cosmetics and are deeply loved by Shanghai consumers.

Zhèng Guópéi, deputy director of the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau, who came to participate in the excellent new product evaluation activity, confidently said that in the next few years, Shanghai's light industrial products will make significant strides in increasing styles and varieties, upgrading, and increasing added value. Shanghai's light industry will have a batch of products entering the world level in the competition.

    啊，上海货
    ——全国轻工业优秀新产品展评展销会侧记
    本报记者　刘桂莲
    上海货，俏货，时髦货。许多人都有这样的印象。
    在我国轻工产品中，每4块表就有1块是上海产的；每3支牙膏，就有一支是上海的；每6辆自行车中，就有一辆是永久牌的……
    12月22日，全国轻工业优秀新产品展评展销会在新近落成的中国国际贸易中心开幕。上海，这个我国最大的轻工业基地，组成了庞大的代表团，带来了近千个新产品来参加展览，并请专家和消费者来指点评价。
    用“精品簇拥、硕果累累”来形容上海靠科技进步开发的新产品，也许并不夸张。展览台前，有采用新技术和高技术增强出口创汇能力的“永久”牌公路赛车，“凤凰”牌运动车，全透明镂空机械男女表，高速平缝机；有高附加值高技术结合的电脑绘图仪，电脑多头绣花机，大屏幕新闻快讯发布系统；更多的则是瞄准市场缺门和消费热点的日用新产品，有仿车刻铅晶质玻璃器皿，鹰嘴气压保温瓶，全塑配套咖啡壶，高级成套化妆品、工艺表、双历电子表、拱形表、情侣表……在小五金柜前，工作人员介绍，与进口同等水平的上海产无焰打火机，上海市场卖60多元，进口货则100多元；双头电动剃须刀，进口货269元，上海产的则是48元。
    工艺水平高、产品设计精、质量可靠、价格合理，这是过去人们对上海货的评价。熟悉上海产品的人，能举出一系列老牌名牌产品，这些产品至今仍受人们欢迎。近些年来，上海轻工新产品在全国叫得响的似乎不那么多了。上海货的优势仿佛在下降。
    上海的轻工业在激烈的竞争中，如今跨上了一个新的台阶。
    比起一些地区，上海轻工企业负担重，投资少，改变面貌的难度大。但上海也有自己的优势，作为老的轻工业基地，这里科技力量雄厚，企业管理水平高，开发新产品能力和协作配套能力强。他们根据自己的优势，走主要靠引进消化国外技术，自己开发的道路。拿近年开发的石英电子表说，在吸收国外技术、引进部分关键设备的基础上，从机芯、壳、面到针、带，开发成功自己的产品，使款式花色由每年只能生产20种发展到每年可生产200种，不但变化快，而且价格便宜。上海家用化学工业的技术力量和规模，是全国之最，他们开发的露美、美加净、爱萝莉、伯龙系列化妆品，比起外国化妆品，有自己的特色，深受上海消费者欢迎。
    前来参加优秀新产品展评活动的上海轻工局副局长郑国培充满自信地说，今后几年，是上海轻工产品朝着增加款式品种、上档次、增加附加值大步前进的新时期。上海的轻工在竞争中将有一大批产品进入世界水平。
