Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh today suggested to Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lalith Athulathmudali, who is visiting India, that India and Sri Lanka should jointly seek ways to resolve issues such as the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka.

During a 45-minute meeting, Singh and Athulathmudali discussed bilateral relations. Singh said his new government would be committed to improving relations with neighboring countries, and that issues between India and Sri Lanka would be given priority.

Singh did not provide details of any specific solutions he proposed to the Sri Lankan side.

Athulathmudali arrived in New Delhi on the evening of the 6th to find out whether the Indian government could guarantee the withdrawal of all Indian troops from Sri Lanka by the end of this year.

New Delhi, December 7 (Xinhua) - Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lalith Athulathmudali announced here today that the fifth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will be held in Colombo from March 8 to 10 next year.

Athulathmudali said the exact dates would still need to be confirmed by the heads of state of the SAARC member countries.

Athulathmudali arrived here on the 6th to meet with Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral. In a joint statement issued after the meeting, both sides reaffirmed their governments' commitment to strengthening regional cooperation and maintaining the SAARC organization.

The SAARC summit, originally scheduled to be held in Colombo this month, was postponed due to Sri Lanka's protest against the presence of Indian troops in the country.

    维·普·辛格和兰扬·维杰拉特内在长达45分钟的会谈中讨论了双边关系问题。辛格说，他的新政府将致力于改善和邻国的关系，印、斯之间的问题将得到优先考虑。
    辛格没有提供他向斯里兰卡方面提出某种解决办法的细节。
    维杰拉特内6日晚到达新德里，意在了解印度新政府是否能保证在今年年底前完成从斯全部撤军。

    南盟首脑会议原定于本月在科伦坡举行，后因斯里兰卡抗议印度军队滞留该国而被迫推迟。
