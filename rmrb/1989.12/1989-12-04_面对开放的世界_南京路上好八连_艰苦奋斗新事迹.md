At the suggestion of General Yang Baibing, in August of this year, the Good Eighth Company returned to Nanjing Road. This is the eighth company's fourth time on Nanjing Road.

Forty years ago, the eighth company, following the thunderous cannons of the liberation of Shanghai, marched into Nanjing Road. There, they wore straw shoes, slept on the streets, lived frugally, and remained clean. Chairman Mao Zedong wrote a poem, "Ode to the Eighth Company," praising them for their decades of hard work for the people.

The history of the Republic has entered a new era of reform and opening up. Today, as the eighth company takes up position on Nanjing Road, compared to their previous three entries in 1949, 1956, and 1972, Nanjing Road has become even more prosperous. The neon lights are dazzling, the goods are abundant, and people of different colors and styles of clothing bustle about. Facing the new life brought by reform and opening up, the soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" still maintain their spirit of hard work.

Some people say that in an open society, one must pay attention to food and clothing, and blend into the open tide with a "modern" lifestyle. However, the soldiers of the eighth company still sleep on double beds issued in the 1950s. When the soldiers are on duty on Nanjing Road, they still wear the old cotton socks issued by the army, paired with yellow plastic sandals and large-sized military boots, looking as "rustic" as can be. This contrasts sharply with the styles of clothing worn by the people on Nanjing Road. But the soldiers of the eighth company say, "We are happy to see people dressed well. We are revolutionary soldiers, and we wear what the army issues us, which does not affect our duty of standing guard and keeping watch here."

In recent years, the eighth company, like the people of the whole country, has gone from poverty to prosperity. But the eighth company believes that facing today's new life, we should neither demand that soldiers live like ascetics again, nor be extravagant. The meeting room of the company has always been quite simple. The nearby sofa factory offered to sell them some sofas at a discount, and the decoration company also came to the company to "beautify" the meeting room. However, the party branch of the company believes that spending money on decorating the meeting room does not fit the company's tradition. Until now, the meeting room still has the long wooden benches from the 1950s. The eighth company has a good rule: visitors from higher-level organizations do not incur any expenses. In the past two years, from the chief of the general staff to the office staff, when they come to the company for meals, they eat whatever the company is having, without adding any extra dishes.

On one day in October, the reporter followed General Yang Baibing to inspect the surroundings of this company. There were no leftover rice or steamed buns in the washing basin, nor were there any lights left on or running water... The company's cadres introduced that the "five ones" (saving one fen of money, one grain of rice, one drop of water, one degree of electricity, one inch of cloth) advocated by the company in the 1950s and 1960s are still being consciously practiced today.

In recent years, the eighth company's insistence on hard work has not been smooth sailing. The trend of high consumption has also blown into the barracks. The eighth company also had a few new soldiers who spent money recklessly. In their eyes, spending their parents' money and their own money was only natural.

Thus, a discussion on "how much do parents' nurturing merits know," and "is it honorable or dishonorable to squander parents' sweat money" was launched in the eighth company. This discussion, like a gentle spring rain, seeped into the hearts of the soldiers. He Jinbin, a young man from the prosperous Suzhou area, had been a private transporter for over three years at home, saving over 10,000 yuan. When he first enlisted, he brought 3,000 yuan, thinking it was not enough to spend, and still asked his family to send money every month. But now he not only does not ask his family to send money, but also deposits all the money he brought into the company's "small bank."

It is precisely because the officers and soldiers of the eighth company inherit and carry forward this traditional virtue that when criminals attempt to bribe their way through, the soldiers on duty are unmoved; when someone chases after the soldiers to sell yellow music tapes, they turn a blind eye...

All of this is the eighth company's response to an open society.

### 面对开放的世界——“南京路上好八连”艰苦奋斗新事迹

    面对开放的世界
    ——“南京路上好八连”艰苦奋斗新事迹
    新华社记者　揭衍珍
    经杨白冰上将提议，今年8月，好八连回到了南京路。这是八连四进南京路。
    40年前，八连随着解放上海的隆隆炮声，开进了南京路。在这里，他们脚穿草鞋，露宿街头，艰苦朴素，一尘不染，毛泽东同志曾为此作诗《八连颂》，赞扬他们为人民艰苦奋斗几十年。
    共和国的历史已进入改革开放的新时期。今天好八连进驻南京路，与1949年、1956年、1972年三进南京路时相比，南京路更加繁华。五光十色的霓虹灯，丰富多采的商品，不同肤色的穿着形形色色服装的红男绿女，熙熙攘攘。面对改革开放带来的新生活，“南京路上好八连”的战士，仍保持着艰苦奋斗的本色。
    有人说，开放的社会就得讲究吃和穿，以“现代”生活方式汇入开放的潮流。而八连战士睡的仍是50年代配发的双人床。战士们在南京路上执勤，脚上穿的，仍是部队发的那人称“解放袜”的老纱袜，配上那双黄色的塑料凉鞋和大头解放鞋要多“土”有多“土”。这和南京路上游人着装款式形成强烈的反差。可是八连的士兵说，人们穿得好，我们高兴。我们是革命战士，部队发什么，我们穿什么，并不影响在这里站岗放哨。
    这些年来，八连和全国人民一样，由穷变富。但八连认为，面对今天的新生活，既不能要求战士重过苦行僧式的日子，也不能奢侈。连队的会议室一直比较简陋，驻地附近的沙发厂主动提出以优惠价卖给他们一些沙发，装璜公司也上门要为连队把会议室“打扮”一下。但连队党支部认为，把钱用在装修会议室上，不符合连队的传统。直到现在，会议室里摆的仍是50年代用的长条木凳。八连有个好规矩，上级机关来人一律不破费。这两年，上至总部首长，下至机关干部，在连队就餐，都是遇上连队吃啥就吃啥，从不另加菜。
    10月的一天，记者跟随杨白冰上将在这个连队的周围察看，看不到刷碗池里有剩饭、馒头，也看不到长明灯、“常流水”……连队干部介绍说，五六十年代连队倡导的“五个一”（节约一分钱、一粒米、一滴水、一度电、一寸布）至今仍在自觉坚持。
    这些年来，八连坚持艰苦奋斗也不是一帆风顺的。高消费风也曾刮进军营。八连也有少数新战士花钱大手大脚。在他们眼里，花父母的钱，花自己的钱，顺理成章。
    于是，一场“父母养育之恩知多少”，“挥霍父母的血汗钱光彩不光彩”的讨论在八连展开了。这场讨论如霏霏春雨沁入战士们的心田。从富庶苏南入伍的青年何金斌，在家当过三年多的运输个体户，自己积攒了10000余元，刚入伍时带了3000元觉得不够花，每月还叫家里汇钱。但现在他不仅不叫家里寄钱，还把带来的钱全部存入连队“小银行”。
    八连官兵正是继承和发扬这种传统美德，所以当不法分子企图闯“关”，用大把大把的钱行贿时，执勤的战士不为所动；当有人拿着黄色歌片追着战士叫卖时，他们不屑一顾……
    所有这一切，正是八连面对开放社会的回答。
