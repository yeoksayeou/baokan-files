The seventh Asian Cup Women's Football Championship features a tough match tonight as China faces North Korea.

The North Korean team, participating in the seventh Asian Cup Women's Football Championship, arrived in Hong Kong by plane this afternoon due to visa issues. With their arrival, all eight teams participating in this tournament have now assembled.

The North Korean team conducted their pre-match training at the Hei Wan Tin Stadium this afternoon. The team's coach, when interviewed by reporters, stated that the North Korean women's football team was established in 1986 and has rarely participated in international competitions. Last year, they visited Northeast China for a match, achieving a record of 1 win and 3 losses. In August this year, they traveled to Czechoslovakia, with a record of 1 win, 1 draw, and 4 losses. The average age of the North Korean team is 19 years, and their average height is 1.65 meters. The coach expressed that the primary goal of this participation is to gain experience and understand their standing in Asian women's football.

It is reported that the originally scheduled match between North Korea and Thailand on the evening of the 19th has been rescheduled to 5 PM on the 24th. Tonight, North Korea will face China. On the evening of the 19th, the Japanese team in Group B defeated the Indonesian team with a score of 11:0.

    亚洲杯女子足球赛又一场硬仗
    中国队今晚迎战朝鲜队
    本报香港12月20日电　参加第七届亚洲杯女子足球锦标赛的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国队，由于入境签证的关系，于今天中午才乘飞机抵达香港。至此，参加本届比赛的8支球队已经全部到齐。
    朝鲜队当天下午即到何文田球场作赛前训练。该队教练在接受记者采访时说，朝鲜女足是在1986年组建，一直很少参加国际比赛。去年曾赴我国东北访问比赛，成绩1胜3负。今年8月曾远征捷克斯洛伐克，战绩是1胜1和4负。朝鲜队平均年龄19岁，平均身高1.65米。该教练表示这次参赛主要是见世面，了解自己在亚洲女足的实力地位。
    据悉，原定19日晚上朝鲜队与泰国队的比赛改在24日下午5时进行。21日晚，朝鲜队将同中国队交锋。19日晚，B组的日本队以11∶0大胜印尼队。　（吴沛彝）
