The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "In the ten years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have focused on economic construction, adhered to the four cardinal principles, and adhered to reform and opening up. The national economy has sustained development, the country's economic strength has significantly increased, the living standards of urban and rural residents have significantly improved, and all undertakings have achieved tremendous successes. The overall appearance of the country has undergone profound historical changes."

In the new historical period of adhering to economic construction as the center, it is an important issue that we must solve in theory and practice to correctly understand the unity of adhering to the four cardinal principles and adhering to reform and opening up. The practice of ten years of reform and the lessons of two months of turmoil have made us further realize: comprehensively and accurately grasping the dialectical relationship of the "two basic points" is of great significance for better implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, maintaining their continuity and stability, and smoothly building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The establishment of the "two basic points" is determined by the national conditions of China's socialist primary stage.

The formation and proposal of the two basic points are the products of the Party's exploration of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee has used the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, starting from considering and studying China's national conditions, gradually forming and proposing the basic line with economic construction as the center and adhering to the two basic points as the main content.

"The country is in the primary stage of socialism," this scientific judgment is the theoretical basis for the Party to propose the two basic points of the basic line. On the one hand, it clearly states that China's society is already a socialist society, so we must adhere to socialism and not deviate from it, which provides an objective basis for adhering to the four cardinal principles. Pursuing bourgeois liberalization and retreating to capitalism is absolutely not allowed. On the other hand, it clearly distinguishes the primary stage of socialism from the advanced stage, providing a realistic basis for the general policy of reform and opening up. The important economic characteristic of the primary stage of socialism is that the productive forces are relatively backward, and developing the productive forces is the fundamental task of socialism. To develop the productive forces, we must implement the general policy of reform and opening up; reform and opening up are important driving forces and necessary conditions for the continuous development of the primary stage of socialist society.

The two basic points were first proposed and repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. He combined the adherence to the socialist road, the adherence to the people's democratic dictatorship, the adherence to the leadership of the Communist Party, and the adherence to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and summarized them as the adherence to the four cardinal principles. This was first proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in his speech at the Party's theoretical work meeting in 1979, and he also gave it new connotations under new historical conditions. He pointed out that these four cardinal principles are "what our Party has consistently adhered to," and to achieve the four modernizations, "the Central Committee believes that today we must repeatedly emphasize the adherence to these four cardinal principles because some people (even if it is only a very small number of people) attempt to shake these basic principles. This is absolutely not allowed. Every Communist Party member, not to mention every Party theorist, must not waver in this fundamental stance. If any of the four cardinal principles are shaken, the entire socialist cause and the entire modernization construction will be shaken." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp. 151, 159). The adherence to the general policy of reform and opening up is a new content and new contribution since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. In the preparatory meeting of the Third Plenary Session, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Only when our minds are liberated can we correctly use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to solve the problems left over from the past and the new series of problems that have emerged, correctly reform the production relations and superstructure that are not in line with the rapid development of productive forces, and determine the specific road, principles, methods, and measures for the realization of the four modernizations according to China's actual situation." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 131). Subsequently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made many profound discussions in a series of articles and speeches on the importance, necessity, and great significance of adhering to the four cardinal principles, economic system reform, political system reform, and opening up to the outside world, as well as the relevant policies. In the article "Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" in June 1984, he deeply argued the relationship between adhering to the four cardinal principles and adhering to reform and opening up while proposing that the most fundamental task of the primary stage of socialism is to develop the productive forces, and summarized the two as the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. On July 4, 1987, he more clearly pointed out: "To build socialist modernization, we must implement the reform and opening-up policy; second, we must adhere to the four cardinal principles, mainly the leadership of the Party, the socialist road, opposing bourgeois liberalization, and opposing the capitalist road. These two basic points are interdependent." (Important Speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, pp. 40-41). The Thirteenth National Congress of the Party formally included "adhering to the two basic points" in the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism, and clearly pointed out that the view that the adherence to the four cardinal principles and the adherence to the general policy of reform and opening up are two basic points that are interdependent and indispensable is one of the contents that constitute the outline of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is a development of scientific socialism.

Adhering to the two basic points not only has historical necessity but also has practical necessity. The practice since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee has proven that adhering to the two basic points is completely correct. Before the Third Plenary Session, we also talked about the four cardinal principles, but without reform and opening up, we were operating in a rigid system and spinning in a closed-door policy, resulting in little development, and the superiority of the socialist system was not fully demonstrated; in the ten years after the Third Plenary Session, we focused on economic construction, adhering to both the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up. Although the time was short, we achieved a threefold increase in national income, state financial revenue, and urban and rural residents' income, and achieved world-renowned achievements. This factual comparison most forcefully illustrates that we must firmly adhere to the two basic points.

"The two basic points" are interpenetrating, interdependent, and unified in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The report of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party pointed out: "The adherence to the four cardinal principles and the adherence to reform and opening up, these two basic points, are interpenetrating, interdependent, and unified in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." This is a highly summarized statement of the dialectical relationship between the two basic points. It shows that the two basic points are the two interdependent aspects within the specific entity of "building socialism with Chinese characteristics," not two isolated things separated from this specific content, fully embodying the principle of universal connection of things in dialectical materialism.

First, "the two basic points" have interdependence in their connotations. The "interdependence" relationship between the two basic points refers to the fact that the two are complementary in content and exist as conditions for each other. The four cardinal principles stipulate that our country is a country that practices people's democratic dictatorship, must take the socialist road, must be led by the Communist Party, and must be guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. These four cardinal principles are the political foundation of our country, so we repeatedly emphasize that the four cardinal principles are the "foundation of the state." The general policy of reform and opening up stipulates that our socialist country must carry out reforms to change the rigid economic system and highly centralized political system that restrict the development of productive forces; it stipulates that our socialist country must also face the world and fully absorb the capital, science and technology, and management methods from abroad that are beneficial to the development of socialism. If we do not reform, we will stagnate; if we do not open up, we will be isolated. Our socialist construction will not be able to develop rapidly. Therefore, we say that reform and opening up is the "road to national strength." One is the "foundation of the state," and the other is the "road to national strength." The two complement each other, and neither can do without the other. The four cardinal principles point out the direction and the path to follow for reform and opening up, so that the general policy of reform and opening up can be correctly implemented. Reform and opening up, on the other hand, open up a realistic path for the development of socialist productive forces, giving the four cardinal principles rich and fresh content. If we only talk about reform and opening up without talking about the four cardinal principles, then it is not socialist reform and opening up, and it will inevitably slide into bourgeois liberalization. Similarly, if we talk about the four cardinal principles in isolation from reform and opening up, we will go back to the old path before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and the productive forces will not develop rapidly, the material and cultural life of the people will not improve, the superiority of socialism will not be fully demonstrated, and adhering to the four cardinal principles will become an empty slogan. The result will only provide a breeding and spreading ground for bourgeois liberalization.

Second, "the two basic points" have interpenetration in their movement mechanism. The "interpenetration" relationship between the two basic points refers to the fact that their existence and movement are not isolated from each other, but are interpenetrating, interrelated, interdependent, and mutually promoting. In the new historical conditions, adhering to the four cardinal principles must continuously give the four cardinal principles new connotations in the practice of reform and opening up. Marxism, the socialist system, the leadership of the Party, and people's democratic dictatorship themselves need to be continuously enriched, improved, and developed in the practice of reform and opening up. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the superiority of the socialist system was not fully demonstrated, an important reason being that some conclusions of Marxism and some characteristics of the socialist system were understood in a rigid and dogmatic way. In the ten years of reform and opening up in China, an important reason for achieving internationally recognized achievements is that the content of the four cardinal principles has been enriched and developed in the process of reform and opening up. In essence, the four cardinal principles themselves have the attributes of practice, reform, opening up, and development, and are absolutely not subjective, rigid, closed, and stagnant dogmas. It is precisely because of this that the "four adherences" have vitality, persuasiveness, and infectiousness. This is one aspect. On the other hand, reform and opening up are carried out under the guidance of the four cardinal principles. Our reform is itself the self-improvement and self-development of the socialist system and people's democratic dictatorship under the guidance of Marxism and the leadership of the Communist Party; our opening up is itself the use of Marxism and the leadership of the Communist Party to face the world, take the essence and discard the dross, and use it for socialism. Without the "four adherences," reform and opening up will deviate from the socialist track and take the capitalist path. Any use of reform and opening up to promote bourgeois liberalization is something we firmly oppose.

Third, "the two basic points" have unity in practice. The "organic unity" relationship between the two basic points refers to the fact that their starting point and foothold are consistent and are unified in practice in the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Whether it is the "four adherences" or reform and opening up, their goal is the basic line of the Party clearly proposed: "to build our country into a prosperous, strong, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country." Specifically, adhering to the four cardinal principles is to ensure that our modernization construction has a clear direction, a stable social environment, and the unity of will, unity of steps, and high social cohesion of 1.1 billion people; adhering to reform and opening up is to liberate people's minds and productive forces, absorb everything beneficial to us from the world, enhance the vitality and strength of socialism, and accelerate the pace of revitalizing China. It can be seen that the goals of the "two basic points" are completely consistent. Next, both basic points serve and serve the center of economic construction. The relationship between the two basic points, in essence, reflects the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, economic base and superstructure. In the period of socialist construction, under China's specific conditions, the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, economic base and superstructure is manifested as the contradiction between productive forces and political and economic systems. To solve this contradiction, we must adhere to the four cardinal principles and adhere to reform and opening up to consolidate, improve, and develop our socialist system. These two aspects, concentrated in one point, are the issue of liberating and developing social productive forces. Only when the productive forces are developed can the socialist system be fundamentally consolidated, and the superiority of the socialist system can be demonstrated.

Adhering to the "two basic points" must oppose the erroneous tendencies of liberalization and rigidity.

The interdependent and interpenetrating relationship between the two basic points requires that in practice, both hands must be grasped, and neither should be neglected. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly proposed to grasp both hands, one hand to grasp reform and opening up, and the other hand to severely crack down on economic crimes, grasp spiritual civilization construction, grasp legal system construction, and grasp ideological and political work, and to firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization and various decadent things. However, in actual work, it has not been well implemented, mainly because the adherence to the four cardinal principles is not consistent, and it has not been used as a basic ideology to educate the people, educate young people and students, and educate all cadres and Communist Party members. One hand is relatively hard, and the other hand is relatively soft, and the hard and soft are not in proportion. Especially some Party leaders passively deal with the policy of adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, causing the bourgeois liberalization trend to spread seriously, which is one of the important reasons for the political turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the spring and summer of this year. This harsh fact has awakened us: "the two basic points" must be implemented simultaneously, and any deviation or light and heavy, soft and hard are very harmful.

Practice has proven that there is a struggle in the understanding of the two basic points themselves. On the issue of the four cardinal principles, there is a question of whether to view the four cardinal principles from a Marxist perspective or a rigid perspective. On the issue of reform and opening up, there is a question of whether to view reform and opening up from a Marxist perspective or a liberal perspective. Therefore, adhering to the basic line of the Party's two basic points, we must oppose both "left" and "right" tendencies. In view of the lessons of the relatively long period of not resolutely and thoroughly adhering to the four cardinal principles in the past, we must now clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization.

Bourgeois liberalization is an erroneous ideology that denies the socialist system and advocates the capitalist system. The sharp confrontation between the four cardinal principles and bourgeois liberalization today can be said to be largely reflected in the question of whether reform and opening up should adhere to the socialist direction. Some people who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization also seem to be very enthusiastic about "reform and opening up." Their so-called "economic system reform" is to abolish public ownership and establish private ownership; their "political system reform" is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and establish a multi-party system; their so-called "reform in the field of ideology and culture" is to cancel the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and establish the dominance of bourgeois ideology in the ideological field. The essence of this so-called "reform and opening up" is capitalistization, which is to bring China into the Western capitalist system.

The facts since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have shown that those who are enthusiastic about promoting bourgeois liberalization and insist on changing China's socialist system and canceling the leadership of the Communist Party are only a very small number. Most comrades, due to their inability to accurately grasp the unity of the "two basic points," due to the constant changes in objective circumstances, the constant emergence of new situations and new problems, and due to differences in understanding and different practical conditions and environments, it is inevitable that there will be various deviations and mistakes. For deviations and one-sidedness in understanding, we cannot adopt simplistic methods. The only correct attitude is to adhere to the Marxist line of thought that starts from reality, seeks truth from facts, and practice is the criterion for testing truth, and to follow the principle of combining theory with practice, gradually correct thoughts, and unify understanding. Only in this way can we encourage a large number of theoretical workers and practical workers to carry forward the spirit of liberating the mind, daring to explore and innovate, and better organically unify the adherence to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, and make contributions to the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

专栏：学习十三届五中全会公报笔谈

    正确认识和把握“两个基本点”的辩证关系
    魏汉鑫  李卫星
    党的十三届五中全会指出：“党的十一届三中全会以来的十年中，我们以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，国民经济持续发展，国家经济实力显著增强，城乡居民生活明显改善，各项事业都取得了巨大成就，整个国家的面貌发生了深刻的历史性变化。”
    在坚持以经济建设为中心的新的历史时期，正确理解坚持四项基本原则与坚持改革开放相统一，是我们在理论和实践上所要解决的重要问题。十年改革的实践，两个月动乱的教训，使我们进一步认识到：全面地准确地把握“两个基本点”的辩证关系，对于更好地贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线方针政策，保持其连续性和稳定性，顺利地建设有中国特色的社会主义，具有十分重大的意义。
    “两个基本点”的确立是由我国社会主义初级阶段的国情决定的
    两个基本点的形成和提出，是我们党探索有中国特色的社会主义道路的产物。党的十一届三中全会以来，党中央运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，从考虑和研究中国的国情入手，逐步形成和提出了以经济建设为中心、坚持两个基本点为主要内容的基本路线。
      “我国正处在社会主义的初级阶段”，这个科学论断是党提出基本路线的两个基本点的理论依据。一方面，它明确了我国社会已经是社会主义社会，所以我们必须坚持而不能离开社会主义，这就为坚持四项基本原则提供了客观基础。搞资产阶级自由化，走回头路，倒退到资本主义是绝对不行的。另一方面，它明确了社会主义初级阶段与高级阶段的区别，为改革开放的总方针总政策提供了现实依据。社会主义初级阶段的重要经济特征是生产力比较落后，发展生产力是社会主义的根本任务。为了发展生产力，必须实行改革开放的总方针；改革开放是初级阶段的社会主义社会不断发展的重要动力和必要条件。
    两个基本点是邓小平同志最早提出并一再坚持的。把坚持社会主义道路、坚持人民民主专政、坚持共产党的领导、坚持马列主义毛泽东思想，放在一起，并概括为坚持四项基本原则，这是邓小平同志在1979年党的理论工作务虚会上的讲话中首先提出的，并且在新的历史条件下赋予它新的时代囊容。他指出，这四项基本原则“是我们党长期以来所一贯坚持的”，为了实现四个现代化，“中央认为，今天必须反复强调坚持这四项基本原则，因为某些人（哪怕只是极少数人）企图动摇这些基本原则。这是决不许可的。每个共产党员，更不必说每个党的思想理论工作者，决不允许在这个根本立场上有丝毫动摇。如果动摇了这四项基本原则中的任何一项，那就动摇了整个社会主义事业，整个现代化建设事业。”（《邓小平文选》第151、159页）。坚持改革开放的总方针，则是党的十一届三中全会以来的新内容、新贡献。就在三中全会的预备会上，邓小平同志指出：“只有思想解放了，我们才能正确地以马列主义、毛泽东思想为指导，解决过去遗留的问题，解决新出现的一系列问题，正确地改革同生产力迅速发展不相适应的生产关系和上层建筑，根据我国的实际情况，确定实现四个现代化的具体道路、方针、方法和措施。”（《邓小平文选》第131页）此后，邓小平同志在一系列文章和讲话中，就坚持四项基本原则、经济体制改革、政治体制改革和对外开放的重要性、必要性、重大意义以及有关的方针政策，作了许多精辟的论述。1984年6月在《建设有中国特色的社会主义》一文中，他在提出社会主义初级阶段的最根本任务就是发展生产力的同时，深刻论证了坚持四项基本原则与坚持改革开放的关系，并把两者归结为建设有中国特色的社会主义道路。1987年7月4日，他更明确地指出：“搞社会主义现代化建设是基本路线。要搞现代化建设使中国兴旺发达起来，第一，必须实行改革、开放政策；第二，必须坚持四项基本原则，主要是坚持党的领导，坚持社会主义道路，反对资产阶级自由化，反对走资本主义道路。这两个基本点是相互依存的。”（《邓小平同志的重要讲话》第40——41页）党的十三大，正式把“坚持两个基本点”纳入党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，而且明确指出：坚持四项基本原则同坚持改革开放的总方针这两个基本点相互结合、缺一不可的观点，是构成建设有中国特色的社会主义理论轮廓的内容之一。这是对科学社会主义的发展。
    坚持两个基本点不仅有历史的必然性，而且有现实的必要性。十一届三中全会以来的实践证明，坚持两个基本点是完全正确的。三中全会以前的几十年，我们也讲四项基本原则，但是没有改革开放，是在僵化的体制中运行，是在闭关锁国中打转的，结果是发展不大，社会主义制度的优越性没有能充分发挥出来；三中全会以后的十年，我们以经济建设为中心，既坚持四项基本原则，又坚持改革开放，时间虽不长，但我们达到了国民生产总值、国家财政收入和城乡居民收入的三个翻一番，取得了举世瞩目的成就。这个事实对比，最有力地说明我们必须毫不动摇地坚持两个基本点。
    “两个基本点”相互贯通，相互依存，统一于建设有中国特色的社会主义的实践
    党的十三大报告指出：“坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放这两个基本点，相互贯通，相互依存，统一于建设有中国特色的社会主义的实践。”这是对两个基本点辩证关系的高度概括。它表明，两个基本点是“建设有中国特色的社会主义”这一特定事物内在统一的两个方面，而不是离开这一特定内容的两件孤立的事情，充分体现了唯物辩证法关于事物是普遍联系的原理。
    首先，“两个基本点”在内涵上具有依存性。两个基本点“相互依存”的关系是指两者在内容上相辅相成，互为存在的条件。四项基本原则规定了我们这个国家是实行人民民主专政的国家，必须走社会主义道路，必须由共产党领导，必须用马列主义、毛泽东思想来指导。这四项基本原则是我们国家的政治基础，因此，我们一再强调，四项基本原则是“立国之本”。改革开放的总方针规定了我们这个社会主义国家必须进行改革，以便改变束缚生产力发展的僵化的经济体制和高度集中的政治体制；规定了我们这个社会主义国家还必须面向世界，充分吸取国外、海外一切有利于社会主义发展的资金、科学技术和管理方法。固步自封，不进行改革，闭关自守，不实行对外开放，我们的社会主义建设就不能迅速发展。因此，我们说改革开放是“强国之路”。一个是“立国之本”，一个是“强国之路”，两者相辅相成，谁也离不开谁。四项基本原则为改革开放指明了方向和遵循的道路，使改革开放的总方针得以正确贯彻执行。改革开放则为发展社会生产力开辟了现实道路，赋予四项基本原则充实的新鲜的内容。如果只讲改革开放，不讲四项基本原则，那就不是社会主义的改革开放，就必然会滑入资产阶级自由化。同样，如果撇开改革开放孤立地讲四项基本原则，就会回到十一届三中会全以前的老路上去，生产力得不到迅速发展，人民的物质文化生活得不到改善，社会主义的优越性不能充分发挥，坚持四项基本原则也就成了一句空话，其结果只能为资产阶级自由化提供孳生和传播的温床。
    第二，“两个基本点”在运动机制上具有贯通性。两个基本点“相互贯通”的关系，是指两者的存在和运动都不是相互隔绝、相互孤立的，而是相互渗透、相互结合、相互制约、相互促进的。在新的历史条件下坚持四项基本原则，必须在改革开放的实践中不断赋予四项基本原则以新的时代内容。马克思主义、社会主义制度、党的领导和人民民主专政，本身就需要在改革开放的实践中不断丰富、完善和发展。十一届三中全会以前，社会主义制度的优越性之所以未能充分发挥出来，一个重要的原因，就是对马克思主义的某些结论和社会主义制度的某些规定性作了僵化、教条的理解。我国改革开放十年，之所以能取得举世公认的成就，一个重要原因，是在改革开放中充实和发展了四项基本原则的内容。实质上，四项基本原则，本身就具有实践的、改革的、开放的、发展的属性，而绝不是主观的、僵化的、封闭的、停滞的教条。也唯其如此，“四个坚持”才具有生命力、说服力和感染力。这是一方面。另一方面，改革开放是在四项基本原则指导下进行的。我们的改革，本身就是在马克思主义指导下和共产党领导下的社会主义制度和人民民主专政的自我完善、自我发展；我们的开放，本身就是在马克思主义指导和共产党领导下通过面向世界，取其精华，去其糟粕，为社会主义所用。离开了“四个坚持”，改革开放就会离开社会主义轨道，走向资本主义歧途。任何以改革开放之名，搞资产阶级自由化，都是我们坚决反对的。
    第三，“两个基本点”在实践上具有统一性。两个基本点“有机统一”关系是指两者的出发点和落脚点是一致的，并在实践中统一于建设有中国特色的社会主义。无论是“四个坚持”，还是改革开放，其目标都是党的基本路线中明确提出的：“为把我国建成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家”。具体说来，坚持四项基本原则，是为了使我们的现代化建设有明确的方向，有稳定的社会环境，有十一亿人民的统一意志、统一步调和高度的社会凝聚力；坚持改革开放，是为了解放人们的思想和社会生产力，吸取世界上一切对我们有益的东西，增强社会主义的活力和实力，加速振兴中华的步伐。可见，“两个基本点”的目标是完全一致的。其次，两个基本点都服从和服务于经济建设这个中心。两个基本点的关系，其实质是反映了生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑的矛盾。在社会主义建设时期，在中国的具体条件下，生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑的矛盾表现为生产力和政治体制、经济体制之间的矛盾。要解决这一矛盾，必须坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放来巩固、完善、发展我们的社会主义制度。这两个方面，集中到一点就是解放社会生产力，发展社会生产力的问题。只有生产力发展了，才可能从根本上巩固社会主义制度，社会主义制度的优越性才能显示出来。
    坚持“两个基本点”必须反对自由化和僵化两种错误倾向
    两个基本点相互依存、相互贯通的关系，要求在实践中坚持两手抓，不可偏废。邓小平同志多次提出要两手抓，一手抓改革开放，一手抓严厉打击经济犯罪，抓精神文明建设，抓法制建设，抓思想政治工作，旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化及形形色色的腐朽的东西。然而，在实际工作中没有得到很好的贯彻，主要是坚持四项基本原则不够一贯，没有把它作为基本思想来教育人民，教育青年和学生，教育全体干部和共产党员，一手比较硬，一手比较软，一硬一软不相称。特别是党的个别领导人消极对待坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，造成资产阶级自由化思潮严重泛滥，这是导致今年春夏之交发生政治动乱和反革命暴乱的重要原因之一。这个严酷的事实警醒了我们：“两个基本点”必须同时并举，任何偏离或此轻彼重、此软彼硬都是十分有害的。
    实践证明，在对两个基本点本身的认识上，是存在着斗争的。在四项基本原则问题上，存在着用马克思主义的观点还是用僵化的观点来看待四项基本原则的问题。在改革开放的问题上，存在着用马克思主义的观点还是用自由化的观点看待改革开放的问题。因此，坚持党的基本路线的两个基本点，既要反对“左”的倾向，又要反对右的倾向。鉴于过去较长时期坚持四项基本原则不坚决、不彻底的教训，当前尤其要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。
    资产阶级自由化思想是一种否定社会主义制度、主张资本主义制度的错误思想。当前四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，可以说在很大程度上表现在改革开放要不要坚持社会主义方向这个问题上。一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人，也似乎十分热衷于“改革开放”。他们的所谓的“经济体制改革”，就是废除公有制，确立私有制；他们的“政治体制改革”，就是推翻共产党的领导，搞什么多党制；他们的所谓“思想文化领域里的改革”，就是取消马列主义、毛泽东思想的指导，建立资产阶级思想在意识形态领域的统治。这种所谓“改革开放”的实质，就是资本主义化，就是把中国纳入西方资本主义体系。
    十一届三中全会以来的事实表明，热衷于搞资产阶级自由化，执意要改变中国的社会主义制度，取消共产党的领导的人只是极少数。多数同志由于未能准确地把握“两个基本点”相统一的关系，由于客观情况的不断变化，新情况和新问题的不断出现，由于认识上的差别和实践条件、环境的不同，出现这样那样的偏差和失误，都是在所难免的。对于认识上的偏差和片面性，不能采取简单化的办法。唯一正确的态度，是坚持党的从实际出发、实事求是、实践是检验真理的标准的马克思主义思想路线，遵循理论联系实际的原则，逐步端正思想，统一认识。只有这样，才能有利于鼓励广大理论工作者和实际工作者发扬解放思想、勇于探索和创新的精神，更好地把坚持四项基本原则和改革开放有机地统一起来，为建设有中国特色的社会主义做出贡献。
