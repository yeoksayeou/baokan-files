	On December 10, one million people from the Chilean opposition held an unprecedented large political rally in O'Higgins Park in the capital Santiago, announcing the end of their election campaign.

	Patricio Aylwin, the presidential candidate of the opposition parties, said in his speech at the rally that if he is elected president, he will strive to unite all Chileans. He said that the Chilean people are abandoning dictatorship and restoring the dignity of a free people. He announced plans to fight poverty and implement health, education, and housing programs "for all."

	The current military government in Chile came to power in a 1973 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende. After the public vote last October rejected Pinochet's request to continue serving as president for another eight years, it was decided to hold elections on December 14 this year.

	During the election campaign, the opposition unanimously nominated the Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin as their presidential candidate. Forces close to the government nominated former Finance Minister Hernán Büchi and businessman Francisco Errázuriz as their presidential candidates. So far, all opinion polls have favored Aylwin.

    智利反对派举行集会
    智利反对派一百万人十日在首都圣地亚哥的奥希金斯公园举行史无前例的盛大政治集会，宣布结束竞选活动。
    反对党总统候选人帕特里西奥·艾尔文在集会上发表讲话说，如果他当选总统，他将谋求把全体智利人团结起来。他说智利人正在抛弃独裁，恢复作为自由人民的尊严。他宣布要同贫困作斗争，推行“为大家”的卫生、教育和住房计划。
    智利现军人政府是一九七三年经过政变推翻民选的阿连德政府上台的。在去年十月举行的公民投票否决皮诺切特继续连任八年总统的要求之后，决定今年十二月十四日举行大选。
    在竞选过程中，反对派一致推举基督教民主党人艾尔文为总统候选人。接近政府的力量分别推举前财政部长埃尔南·布奇和企业家弗朗西斯科·埃拉苏里斯为总统候选人。至今的历次民意测验一直有利于艾尔文。
