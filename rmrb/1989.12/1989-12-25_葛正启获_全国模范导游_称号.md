Ge Zhengqi Receives "National Model Guide" Title

KUNMING, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- The National Tourism Administration recently held a naming and commendation meeting here, awarding Ge Zhengqi, a German-speaking guide from the Kunming branch of China International Travel Service, the title of "National Model Guide."

On March 2 of this year, Ge Zhengqi accompanied a West German tour group to Tibet. Unfortunately, he fell ill during the trip. Despite his illness, he persevered and continued his work until he collapsed at his post, at the age of 34.

Ge Zhengqi was an advanced worker during his lifetime. He was diligent and dedicated in his work, often declining tips offered by clients.
