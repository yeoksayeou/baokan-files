    Guo Laohan, the head chef of the Liu Fan Township cotton collection station in Yanshan County, Hebei Province, picked up over 200 kilograms of cotton in two months and turned it all over to the state's cotton collection station.

    During this year's peak cotton selling season, Liu Fan Township's cotton station was bustling with activity. Farmers were lined up to sell their cotton, and the ground was littered with scattered cotton. While others didn't pay much attention, Guo Laohan took it to heart. Before and after meals, he could often be seen in corners, nooks, and by the weeds, picking up cotton. Some admired Guo Laohan's money-making scheme and asked him how much he earned. He just smiled. The staff at the cotton collection station knew the truth: Old Guo turned in the cotton without taking a single penny.

    郭老汉拾落棉
    新华社石家庄十二月十一日电　河北省盐山县刘范乡收棉站伙房的大师傅郭玉亭，两个月拾棉花二百多公斤，都交给了国家的收棉站。
    今年售棉旺季，刘范乡棉站门外车水马龙，交棉的庄稼人挤挤擦擦，地上散落了许多雪白的棉花。别人没留意，郭老汉却疼在心里，每逢饭前饭后，墙角下、旮旯里、荒草旁，常出现郭老汉的身影。有人佩服郭老汉的发财之道，问他赚了多少钱，他只是一笑。收棉站里的工作人员心里清楚：老汉交棉分文未取。
