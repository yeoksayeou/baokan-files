Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th.

The reporter learned from the Ministry of Public Security that, with the close cooperation of relevant departments, the Guangdong Public Security Bureau conducted a meticulous investigation and arrested criminals Luo Haixing, Li Peicheng, Xie Zhenrong, and Chen Zewei, who entered the mainland from Hong Kong and Macau and attempted to plan the escape of wanted fugitives.

Criminal Luo Haixing (also known as Luo Haixian) conspired with the head of the so-called "Hong Kong Citizens' Support Association for Patriotic Democratic Movement" (referred to as "Hong Kong Support Association"), Chen Jianxun, to plot the escape of counter-revolutionary rioters wanted by the public security authorities through an alleged "underground channel." In July, Luo and Chen Jianxun arranged for a person who had been working in Beijing to be smuggled to Hong Kong and then transferred to France. In September and October, Luo and Chen Jianxun conspired to arrange for key figures in the Beijing counter-revolutionary riots, Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao, to be smuggled to Hong Kong. On September 7th and October 8th, Luo himself entered Guangzhou twice to make arrangements for the smuggling. The "Hong Kong Support Association," based on the information provided by Luo, sent people into the mainland to attempt to assist Chen, Wang, and others in escaping. On October 14th, Luo Haixing was captured by the border defense department of the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau.

Criminal Li Peicheng was dispatched on October 12th to Zhanjiang, where he attempted to take the wanted fugitive Chen Ziming, who was hiding in Zhanjiang City, out of the city and implement the plan to smuggle them out of the country. He was captured by the Zhanjiang Public Security Bureau the next day.

Hong Kong criminal Li Longqing, who was simultaneously dispatched to be responsible for transporting Chen Ziming and others out of Zhanjiang, was also captured in Shenzhen on December 5th.

Before the arrests of Luo, Li, and Li, the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau also arrested criminals Xie Zhenrong and Chen Zewei, who entered the mainland from Macau and attempted to assist the wanted fugitive Zheng Xuguang in escaping.

A relevant official from the Ministry of Public Security pointed out that these criminals, who entered the mainland from Hong Kong and Macau and attempted to plan and assist the escape of wanted fugitives, were captured and arrested by the Guangdong Public Security Bureau. This has effectively struck a blow to the attempts by foreign reactionary forces to use Hong Kong and Macau as sanctuaries for mainland wanted criminals. The Chinese public security and judicial authorities will severely punish, in accordance with the law, any criminals who dare to plan and assist wanted fugitives in escaping the country.

    从港澳入境策划通缉要犯外逃
    案犯罗海星等被依法逮捕
    公安部负责人指出对此类犯罪分子必须严惩
    本报北京12月25日讯　记者从公安部获悉，广东省公安机关在有关部门的密切配合下，经过缜密侦查，依法逮捕了从港澳入境、企图策划通缉要犯偷渡外逃的案犯罗海星、黎沛成、谢振荣、陈泽伟等人。
    案犯罗海星（又名罗海鲜），于今年7、8月以来，与旨在推翻中央人民政府和煽动内地动乱的所谓“香港市民支援爱国民主运动联合会”（简称“港支联”）领头人岑建勋等勾结，密谋通过所谓“地下通道”，将被我公安机关通缉的反革命暴乱分子偷渡出境。7月间，经罗与岑建勋的策划安排，先将原在北京工作的一个人以偷渡的方法送到香港并转移到法国。9、10月间，罗又与岑建勋密谋安排将煽动、组织、指挥北京反革命暴乱的重要案犯陈子明、王军涛等人偷渡到香港。9月7日和10月8日，罗本人两次入境广州，为组织偷渡进行联系安排。“港支联”根据罗提供的情况，派人入境，企图接应陈、王等犯外逃。10月14日，罗海星被我深圳公安机关边防部门抓获。
    案犯黎沛成，于今年10月12日受指派专程到湛江，次日按“港支联”给的地址、名字和联络暗号，企图将藏匿在湛江市的通缉要犯陈子明等人带离湛江实施偷渡外逃时，被湛江市公安机关抓获。
    与黎沛成同时接受指派负责接运陈子明等逃离湛江的香港案犯李龙庆，也于今年12月5日在深圳市落网。
    在罗、黎、李三犯被捕获之前，我广州市公安机关还依法逮捕了从澳门入境企图接应通缉要犯郑旭光偷渡外逃的案犯谢振荣、陈泽伟。
    公安部有关方面负责人指出，这几名从港澳入境企图策划和接应通缉要犯偷渡外逃的犯罪分子被我广东公安机关缉获并依法逮捕，有力地打击了境外反动势力把港澳作为内地通缉犯的庇护所的企图。中国公安、司法机关对任何胆敢策划和接应被通缉在案的刑事罪犯偷渡外逃的犯罪分子必依法严惩。
