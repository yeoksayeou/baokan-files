The special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the issue of apartheid, after three days of heated debate, adopted the "Declaration on Apartheid and Its Destructive Impact in Southern Africa" and concluded successfully this evening. The declaration comprehensively proposed the objectives, conditions, and methods for a political solution to the South African problem, expressing the international community's close attention to resolving the South African issue. This is an important achievement of the joint efforts of the participating countries, laying a new foundation for the international community to reach a consensus and take joint action to solve the South African problem in the future.

The root of the South African problem lies in the South African government's implementation of the apartheid policy. Long-term brutal racial oppression has sparked the unyielding resistance of the South African people and has also been repeatedly condemned by the international community. Under such internal and external pressures, the South African authorities have expressed a willingness to "reform" apartheid. The new President de Klerk released the former General Secretary of the African National Congress of South Africa, Sisulu, who had been imprisoned for many years, along with eight others, in October of this year. Yesterday, he also met with the imprisoned black leader Mandela to discuss the issue of "ending domestic racial conflicts." These actions indicate that the South African authorities have made some changes in their domestic and foreign policies. However, on the fundamental issue of abolishing the apartheid system, they have not yet taken any substantial policies or measures.

The "Special Committee Against Apartheid" report to the special session of the General Assembly states that the "reforms" carried out by the South African government are cosmetic. The already published "Five-Year Plan for Political Reform" is a replica of white rule, using the rhetoric of "group rights" and "shared rights" to disguise the fact that they actually want to maintain apartheid and preserve the veto power of the white "group." The South African authorities' constitutional plan is to draft a "new constitution," stipulating that at the national level, blacks will gain limited political participation, but they will not have any power that threatens the foundation of apartheid. Moreover, while the South African authorities are pushing for deceptive reforms, they continue to brutally suppress the majority of blacks: maintaining the "Group Areas Act," continuing to force blacks to move from white areas to so-called "independent homelands"; and organizing vigilante groups and assassination squads to attack anti-apartheid activists in black communities, claiming that these are "mutual conflicts" among blacks, and so on.

The apartheid system is incompatible with the progress, civilization, morality, and legal principles of humanity today. It is not a matter of partial change; it must be completely abolished. On the eve of the special session of the General Assembly, South African Foreign Minister Botha sent a letter to UN Secretary-General de Cuellar, expressing a stance of resistance to the "Declaration," indicating that the South African authorities are unwilling to completely eliminate the apartheid system. Botha claimed in his letter that they are willing to resolve the South African issue through negotiations, but they oppose the "Declaration" setting the goal of abolishing the apartheid system and the corresponding principles proposed for negotiations, stating that this "rigid framework" makes negotiations lack flexibility. This reveals their true intentions.

At present, the South African authorities have no intention of abolishing the apartheid system through negotiations. The representatives of the various countries at the special session of the General Assembly also saw this, and therefore they passed the "Declaration" to convey another strong message to the South African authorities: if the South African authorities continue to deny the equal rights of the vast majority of South Africans and insist on the apartheid system, they will face greater punishment, that is, the international community will take more effective measures.

The South African authorities will not easily agree to eradicate the apartheid system, and moreover, there are some countries that openly or secretly tolerate or even support it. Therefore, the task of abolishing apartheid and achieving lasting peace and stability in Southern Africa remains very arduous. However, a new situation of unity among the various peoples of South Africa and their joint struggle against apartheid is taking shape. With the close cooperation and strong support of the international community, they will surely be able to abolish the evil system of apartheid and establish a united, democratic, free, and racially equal society in the end.

    寻求共识　采取行动
    ——评关于种族隔离特别联大
    本报记者　刘开宸
    关于种族隔离问题联大特别会议，经过3天的热烈辩论，通过了《关于种族隔离及其在南部非洲破坏性影响的宣言》后，于今晚顺利闭幕。《宣言》全面提出了政治解决南非问题的目标、条件和方式，表达了国际社会对解决南非问题的密切关注。这是与会各国共同努力取得的重要成果，为今后国际社会解决南非问题达成共识和采取共同行动打下了新的基础。
    南非问题的根源是南非政府推行种族隔离政策。长期残酷的种族压迫，激起了南非人民不屈不挠的反抗，也不断受到了国际社会的谴责。在这种内外压力下，南非当局表示要对种族隔离进行“改革”。新总统德克勒克今年10月释放了关押多年的南非非洲人国民大会前总书记西苏鲁等8人，昨天又会见了仍在狱中的黑人领袖曼德拉，商谈“结束国内种族冲突问题”。这些表明南非当局的内外政策有了某些变化，但是，在废除种族隔离制度这个根本问题上迄未采取实质性的政策和措施。
      “反对种族隔离特别委员会”给特别联大的报告说，南非政府进行的“改革”是装饰性的。已公布的“政治改革5年计划”是白人统治的翻版，用“集团权利”和“分享权利”的词藻加以粉饰，实际上要保持种族隔离并维护白人“集团”的否决权。南非当局的宪政计划，是要拟订“新宪法”，规定在国家一级让黑人获得有限度的参与政治权，但不让他们有威胁到种族隔离基础的任何权力。而且，南非当局在推行骗人的改革的同时，仍在残酷地镇压广大黑人：保持“集团住区法”，继续强迫黑人从白人地区迁移到所谓“独立本土”；并组织自警团和暗杀队在黑人社区袭击反对种族隔离者，并编造说这是黑人“相互倾轧的冲突”，等等。
    种族隔离制度，与当今人类的进步、文明、道德和法理都是格格不入的，不是部分改变的问题，必须彻底废除。在特别联大开幕前夕，南非外长博塔致函联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔，对《宣言》采取抵制态度，表明南非当局不愿彻底消除种族隔离制度。博塔在信中声称他们愿意通过谈判解决南非问题，但反对《宣言》为谈判确定了废除种族隔离制度的目标和提出的一些相应的原则，说这个“僵硬的框架”，使谈判不能有灵活性。这样就一语泄露了他们的“天机”。
    从目前的情况来看，南非当局尚无意通过谈判来废除种族隔离制度。特别联大的各国代表也看到了这一点，因之他们通过《宣言》向南非当局还转达了另一个强有力的信息，即南非当局如继续否定绝大多数南非人的平等权、坚持种族隔离制度，会受到更大的惩罚，即国际社会将会采取更加有效的措施。
    南非当局不会轻易同意根除种族隔离制度，何况还有一些国家明里暗里对它表示容忍甚至支持，因此，废除种族隔离、实现南部非洲持久和平与稳定的任务仍是十分艰巨的。但是，南非各族人民加强团结、共同反对种族隔离斗争的新局面正在形成，他们在国际社会的密切配合和大力支援下，最后一定能够废除种族隔离的罪恶制度，建立一个统一、民主、自由和种族平等的社会。
