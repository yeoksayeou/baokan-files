A large-scale television documentary, "Guilin Cultural City" (four episodes), which recreates the historical and cultural landscape of Guilin during the War of Resistance, has been completed after more than ten months of hard work. It was recently broadcast on Guangxi Television and Guilin Television, and received enthusiastic congratulations and affirmations from famous figures who were active in Guilin Cultural City during that time, such as those from Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. This has made us, as the scriptwriters and producers of the documentary, deeply moved.

Guilin Cultural City refers to the historical period from 1938, when Wuhan fell, to 1944, before the great retreat from Guilin. The picturesque Guilin became one of the famous cultural centers in the rear of the War of Resistance in China. Due to the firm implementation of the party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front led by Zhou Enlai, due to the use of contradictions between the Guangxi clique and Chiang Kai-shek, and between the local and central government of the Kuomintang, and due to the impact and promotion of the anti-Japanese salvation movement, the cultural industry in Guilin developed rapidly. It once presented an unprecedented prosperous scene, which had a wide influence both domestically and internationally. Those who fought in Guilin Cultural City included more than 1,000 famous writers, artists, natural scientists, social scientists, and patriotic democrats such as Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Liu Yazi, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Ou Yang Yuqian, Xu Beihong, He Xiangning, Zhou Tiaofen, Li Siguang, Gao Sizhi, Hu Yuzhi, Tao Xingzhi, Yang Dongcun, and Xue Muxiang. At the critical moment of national crisis, under the banner of the party's anti-Japanese national united front, they, as the backbone of Guilin Cultural City, widely united progressive figures from various parties and strata, overseas Chinese, and international anti-Japanese forces to carry out a magnificent anti-Japanese salvation cultural movement. The history of Guilin Cultural City occupies a glorious page in the history of modern Chinese revolution, modern Chinese thought and culture, and modern Chinese literature. However, during the ten years of turmoil, right and wrong were confused, and black and white were mixed. Many comrades who engaged in anti-Japanese cultural activities in Guilin at that time were therefore slandered and persecuted. We made this film to restore the true face of history.

Guilin Cultural City is no longer just a geographical name; it has become a symbol of a nation's struggle and unity in times of hardship and danger. At that time, under the leadership of the party, the whole nation united to build a new Great Wall with the spirit of "united as one to fight for the survival of the nation." This high-spirited patriotism is even more worthy of promotion today. People need to have some spirit. A nation needs a national spirit. In recent years, there has been too much emphasis on enjoyment, consumption, and material things, and too little on spiritual things. Many people who grew up after the War of Resistance do not understand this history. However, the spirit of hard work, unity, selflessness, and readiness to die for the country that emerged in the history of Guilin Cultural City has strong practical significance today, when we are opening up to the outside world and revitalizing China. This is also one of the purposes of making and producing this film.

Making this film is a big project. The subject matter is vast, the scope is wide, and the events and characters involved are numerous, making it very difficult to complete. Thanks to the strong support from all sides, including old comrades who fought in Guilin Cultural City during that time and are now scattered all over the country, especially Xia Yan, who fought personally in Guilin at that time, despite being 90 years old this year, he kindly agreed to be the consultant of the film. From the preparation of the shooting, the collection of materials, the shooting outline, the artistic style to the writing of the narration, he carefully provided specific opinions. Xia Yan specially instructed that to make the young generation familiar with the history of the War of Resistance, the narration needs to be written in a way that is easy to understand and clear. The production team also worked hard under the influence of the spirit of the War of Resistance in the Cultural City. From March, when the preparation for shooting began, to the completion of production in November, everyone worked continuously, almost without taking a weekend off. They also collected materials from that time from various sources, achieving the goal of objectively and passionately recreating this historical period. Among them, there are some very precious scenes, such as the documentary of Ye Jianying teaching strategy and tactics at that time, which also includes Ye Jianying's voice from that time. The New An Traveling Troupe singing "March of the Volunteers" also includes the original sound. In addition, the ruins of Guilin that were bombed at that time, as well as the chaotic scenes of the Great Retreat from Hunan and Guangxi, are also shocking to the viewers because of their authenticity.

    弘扬爱国主义精神
    ——摄制《桂林文化城》电视文献片感言
    邓生才　陈敦德
    一部再现抗战烽火中桂林历史文化风貌的大型电视文献艺术片《桂林文化城》（四集）经过十个多月的辛勤努力，终于最近分别在广西电视台、桂林电视台播出，并得到来自北京、上海、广州等地当年曾活跃于桂林文化城的著名人士的热情祝贺与肯定，这使我们作为该片的编剧和制片人心情十分激动。
    桂林文化城，指的是1938年武汉沦陷后到1944年桂林大撤退以前这段历史时期，山奇水秀的桂林成了抗战中国大后方著名的文化中心之一。由于周恩来领导的中央南方局坚决执行党的抗日民族统一战线的政策，由于我党利用桂系与蒋介石之间、国民党地方与中央之间的矛盾，由于抗日救亡运动洪流的冲击和推动，使得桂林的文化事业迅速发展，曾经出现过一派前所未有的繁荣景象，在国内外都产生了广泛的影响。在桂林文化城战斗过的，有郭沫若、茅盾、巴金、柳亚子、夏衍、田汉、欧阳予倩、徐悲鸿、何香凝、邹韬奋、李四光、高士其、胡愈之、陶行知、杨东莼、薛暮桥等1000多位知名的作家、艺术家、自然科学家、社会科学家与爱国民主人士。他们在民族危亡的历史关头，在党的抗日民族统一战线的旗帜下，作为桂林文化城的中坚，广泛团结各党派、各阶层的进步人士和海外华侨及国际抗日力量，开展了轰轰烈烈的抗日救亡文化运动。桂林文化城的历史，在中国现代革命史、中国现代思想文化史、中国现代文学史上，占有光辉的一页。但是，十年动乱，却是非颠倒，黑白混淆，当年在桂林从事抗战文化活动的许多同志，因此遭到诬陷迫害。我们拍这部片子，就是要还历史以本来的面目。
    桂林文化城，已经不是一个地域性的名称，它已经成为一个民族在苦难危亡中呐喊拚搏、团结战斗的象征。当时在党的领导下，全民族团结起来为生死存亡而“万众一心去建设新的长城”的高亢的爱国主义精神，在今天更是值得我们广为弘扬的。人，是要有一点精神的。一个民族更需要有一种民族精神。近些年来，讲享受、讲消费、讲物质的东西多了一点，讲精神的东西少了一点。抗战后长大的不少人，不懂得这段历史；而在桂林文化城这段历史中，焕发出来的艰苦奋斗的精神、团结一致的精神、不为名不为利的精神、视死如归共赴国难的精神等，在对外开放、振兴中华的今天，具有十分强烈的现实意义。这也是我们拍摄与制作这部片子的目的之一。
    摄制这部片子是个大工程，题材大、涉及面广，涉及的事件与人物也多，搞起来十分不易。由于得到各方面包括分布在全国各地的当年在桂林文化城战斗过的老同志们大力支持，特别是当年亲身在桂林战斗过的夏衍同志，尽管今年年届90高龄，欣然应邀担任该片顾问，从筹备拍摄、资料线索、拍摄大纲、艺术风格到解说词的写法，都悉心提出具体意见。夏公特别嘱咐为了让广大青年熟悉抗战历史，解说词特别需要注意写得通俗、易懂、明白。摄制组也在文化城的抗战精神熏陶下艰苦奋斗，从3月筹备开拍到11月中制作完成，大家连续工作，几乎都没有度过星期天。还多方搜集当年资料镜头，达到了客观真实而又充满激情地再现这段历史的目的。其中不乏十分珍贵的镜头，如叶剑英当年讲授战略战术的纪录片，并配有叶剑英当年的声音，当年新安旅行团合唱《大刀进行曲》亦配有原声。另外，桂林当年被炸的废址，以及兵荒马乱的湘桂大撤退等镜头，也因其真实而使观者惊心动魄。
