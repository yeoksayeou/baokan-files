	Utilizing Agricultural By-products to Produce Artificial Panels
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27 (Reporter Pu Xiaojiang) – Agricultural by-products such as hemp stalks, wheat stalks, and cotton stalks, which have long been overlooked, now have a new use.

	Recent research by the Chinese Academy of Forestry's Wood Industry Research Institute shows that if one-tenth of the annual agricultural by-products in the country are used to manufacture artificial panels, it can save 120 million cubic meters of timber and yield a net profit of 8 to 10 billion yuan. Preliminary estimates indicate that China currently produces 400 million tons of agricultural by-products annually. According to wood industry experts, the various types of artificial panels produced from agricultural by-products have performance characteristics comparable to those made from timber. So far, 19 factories nationwide have either started production or are in the process of setting up production lines using this technology, and some have already achieved significant benefits.

    利用农业剩余物生产人造板
    新华社北京12月27日电　（记者浦晓江）一向不受人青睐的麻秆、麦秆、棉秆等农业剩余物，如今有了“用武之地”。
    中国林业科学院木材工业研究所最近的一项研究成果表明，把全国每年1／10的农业剩余物用于制造人造板，可节约木材1.2亿立方米，获纯利80—100亿元。据粗略统计，目前我国农业剩余物，每年达4亿吨。据木材工业专家鉴定，用农业剩余物生产的各种人造板，各种性能与用木材生产的人造板相当。到目前为止，全国已有19家工厂投产或正在投产这种技术的生产线，有的已获得很大效益。
