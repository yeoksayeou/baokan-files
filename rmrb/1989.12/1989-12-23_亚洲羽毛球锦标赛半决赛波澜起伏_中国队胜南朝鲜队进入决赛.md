The Asian Badminton Championships semi-finals saw dramatic turns today as the Chinese team narrowly defeated the South Korean team to secure a spot in the finals. Tomorrow afternoon, they will face the world powerhouse, the Indonesian team. The Malaysian team and the South Korean team tied for third place.

Tonight's match between China and South Korea was particularly intense, especially in the two doubles matches. When the South Korean team submitted their lineup, recent rumors on the court became a reality. South Korea split their world-class men's doubles pair Park Joo-bong and Kim Moon-soo. Park Joo-bong paired with the 21-year-old newcomer Son Jin-hwan, while Kim Moon-soo paired with the 26-year-old veteran singles player Sung Han-kuk. When Xiong Guobao and Zhao Jianhua easily defeated South Korea's first and second singles players, Choi Sang-bum and the second singles player, respectively, China's top doubles pair Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi unexpectedly lost 0-2 to Park Joo-bong and Son Jin-hwan. It is said that Tian Bingyi's waist injury had not fully recovered, and his training was not normal. The South Korean pair, who had not been together for long, had strong net kills and excellent net play, often scoring with rapid, successive kills.

China's second doubles pair consisted of two young players, Zheng Yu-min and Huang Zhenzhong, who had only been training together for a year. In the first set, the Chinese youngsters were too passive, unable to play freely, and lost the first set 7-15. In the second set, the experienced South Korean players used powerful smashes to cause frequent errors from the Chinese players. When Zheng and Huang were down 1-8, Zheng Yu-min consecutively executed seven jump smashes, finally scoring a point. Afterwards, the cheers from the audience never stopped, and the Chinese players caught up to 9-9. In the end, the Chinese team won the set 15-9. In the third set, the fierce flat shots from the two young Chinese players caused their opponents to return the ball too high. Amidst the cheers from the entire stadium, the Chinese team won the final victory with a score of 15-11.

Tonight, the Indonesian team defeated the Malaysian team 5-0.

    亚洲羽毛球锦标赛半决赛波澜起伏
    中国队胜南朝鲜队进入决赛
    本报上海12月22日电　中国羽毛球队今天晚上险胜南朝鲜队，夺得了亚洲羽毛球锦标赛的决赛权，明天下午决赛的对手是世界劲旅印度尼西亚队。马来西亚队与南朝鲜队并列第三。
    今晚的中国南朝鲜交锋，最为惊心动魄的是两场双打。当南朝鲜队交上比赛名单时，近日来在赛场的传闻变成了现实。南朝鲜将世界级的男双朴柱奉、金文秀拆对，朴柱奉与21岁的新秀孙振焕配对。而金文秀则与26岁的单打老将成汉国配对。当熊国宝和赵剑华分别轻松地胜了南朝鲜第一单打崔相范和第二单打后，中国的头号双打配对李永波、田秉毅意外地以0∶2败于朴柱奉和孙振焕。据说田秉毅腰伤未愈，训练不够正常，而南朝鲜这对配合不久的双打选手网前扑杀能力强，抢点出色，常以连珠炮似的扣杀得分。
    中国队的第二双打是两员小将，郑昱闽和黄展忠配对训练也仅1年。第一局，中国小将过于消极，放不开手，以7∶15先失一局。第二局，经验丰富的南朝鲜选手又以有力的劈杀使中国队员频频失误。当郑、黄以1∶8落后时，郑昱闽连续7次跳起扣杀，终于获得1分，其后，观众呼喊声浪不绝，中国选手追成9∶9平。最后，中国队终以15∶9扳回一局。第三局郑、黄两员小将凶狠的平球造成对方回球过高。在全场呐喊声中，中国队以15∶11赢得最后的胜利。
    今晚印尼队以5∶0战胜马来西亚队。　　（胡廷楣）
