	Obese Women Less Likely to Develop Breast Cancer

	BEIJING (Xinhua) -- According to a report from Harvard University, obesity does not increase the risk of breast cancer in women as commonly believed. Instead, it may even protect them from the disease.

	Researchers at Harvard University conducted a study on over 115,000 women aged 30 to 55. The results showed that the likelihood of developing breast cancer before menopause decreases as weight increases. Obese women have a 40% lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to slender women. However, after menopause, the risk of developing breast cancer is similar for both obese and slender women.

	The researchers are still unsure why obesity might inhibit the development of breast cancer. It is speculated that hormonal changes in obese individuals may be beneficial.

	However, the researchers emphasize that maintaining a healthy weight is more beneficial for overall health.

    肥胖妇女不易得乳腺癌
    新华社北京12月1日电  据外电援引哈佛大学的一项研究报告说，肥胖并不像人们普遍认为的那样会增加妇女患乳腺癌的危险，相反，还会因此而免于乳腺癌的折磨。
    哈佛大学的研究人员对11.5万多名30—55岁的妇女进行跟踪研究的结果表明，妇女在绝经前患乳腺癌的机率随体重增加呈下降趋势，肥胖妇女患乳腺癌的机率比瘦削妇女低40％，而在绝经后胖者与瘦者之间患乳腺癌的机率并无太大差别。
    研究人员还不能确定为何肥胖能抑制乳腺癌的产生。据推测，肥胖者体内的激素可能发生有益的变化。
    不过研究人员强调说，妇女保持苗条更有益于健康。
