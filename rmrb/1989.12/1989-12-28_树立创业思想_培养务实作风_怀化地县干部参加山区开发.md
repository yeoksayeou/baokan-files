The Huaihua Municipal Water and Electricity Bureau, which was once a frequent target of audits, has now become a model unit for mountain development. The bureau had nearly 200,000 yuan in surplus funds each year, which were previously used to buy cars and other items, leading to significant public dissatisfaction. Since 1987, they have directly invested these surplus funds into mountain development, establishing 268 acres of orange groves. This not only pleased the employees but also greened the mountains, creating wealth for society.

Located at the junction of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, the Huaihua region faces numerous challenges in mountain development. The Huaihua Regional Party Committee and People's Government have focused on activating "internal forces" to break free from poverty and backwardness. The regional committee and government have successively formulated systems and policies to encourage leading cadres and party and government agencies to directly participate in mountain development. All county-level (city-level) principal leaders in the region have established mountain development contact points. In Lupu County, 34 county-level leaders have signed responsibility statements at their respective contact points, making it an important part of their performance evaluation. According to incomplete statistics, leaders at the regional and county levels have jointly developed 48 pilot projects covering 99,000 acres.

Various administrative departments and enterprises have also actively participated in mountain development. The Regional Party Committee Office, Policy Research Office, and United Front Work Department have raised 150,000 yuan to develop a 400-acre citrus base in Yangcun, Huaihua City. The Regional Youth League Committee has jointly developed 1,000 acres of afforestation with Zhongfang Town, Huaihua City, establishing a youth forest farm.

Since 1986, 17 units in Huaihua Region and City have participated in land development. These government organizations have developed 14 mountain farms covering 4,129 acres and planted 400,000 trees.

Several years of practice have shown that party and government agencies directly engaging in development and production have two main advantages. First, they can play a leading and demonstrative role. The development by party and government agencies is highly specialized and has clear advantages over ordinary farmers, providing information, technology, seeds, and sales services to farmers. Second, it has initially alleviated the financial difficulties of administrative units and improved the welfare of cadres and staff. According to calculations, the economic income from mountain development by Huaihua party and government agencies has reached 1.26 million yuan.

    树立创业思想  培养务实作风
    怀化地县干部参加山区开发
    本报长沙电　记者杜若原报道：湖南怀化市水电局前几年经常成为审计部门注意的重点，如今却成了开发山区的先进单位。这个局每年有近20万元的富余财力，以前用来买车、购物，群众意见很大；从1987年起，他们将富余资金直接投入山地开发，建造桔园268亩，不仅职工满意，也绿化了山地，为社会创造了财富。
    位于湘、桂、黔三省交界处的怀化地区，山区建设困难多。怀化地委、行署将摆脱贫困落后的着眼点放在启动“内力”上。地委、行署相继制订制度和政策，鼓励领导干部、党政机关直接投入山区开发，全地区县（市）一级的主要领导都建立了山区开发联系点。溆浦县34名县级领导分别在自己的联系点上签订责任状，作为考核政绩的重要内容。据不完全统计，全地区地县两级领导共办开发试点48个，面积9.9万亩。
    各行政机关和企事业单位，也纷纷参与山区开发。地委办公室、政研室和统战部等部门筹资15万元，在怀化市杨村开发柑桔基地400亩。团地委与怀化市中方镇联营造林1000亩，建起了青年林场。
    自1986年以来，怀化地、市共有17家单位参加土地开发，这些机关团体开发山地建场14个，面积4129亩，栽树40万株。
    几年的实践证明，党政机关直接从事开发生产，一是可发挥带头示范作用。党政机关的开发专业化程度高，比一般农户具有明显优势，可为农户提供信息、技术、良种、销售等服务。二是初步摆脱了行政单位财政拮据窘境，改善了干部职工福利。据测算，怀化党政机关开发山地获经济收入达126万元。
