	In recent years, the Sichuan Provincial Social Sciences Association has organized hundreds of social science researchers from dozens of academic societies to conduct research in various cities and counties, focusing on the development of local economies. This direct service to the grassroots has been widely recognized and welcomed by society.

	The Sichuan Provincial Social Sciences Association has over a hundred affiliated academic societies and research institutes, covering all disciplines in literature, history, philosophy, and economics, with a wealth of talent. In 1986, they organized nearly ten academic societies and research institutes, with dozens of experts and scholars, to go deep into the economically underdeveloped Yingjing County. They lived and worked with the local farmers and officials, conducting research on the county's economic development. After more than a year of effort, they completed the research project "Strategic Study on the Development of Commodity Economy in Yingjing County." By implementing these research findings, the county shifted its focus from emphasizing development speed to improving the "quality of economic development." As a result, economic efficiency significantly improved, with county fiscal revenue increasing by approximately 20% annually compared to 1986, and per capita income for farmers reaching nearly 600 yuan.

	The following year, the provincial association organized over 60 social science researchers to explore the economic development of Guangyuan, a new industrial city in Sichuan. This research was included as a key project in the province's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for philosophy and social sciences. The researchers, through investigations and studies, produced nearly 20 research reports, which were highly valued by the city of Guangyuan. Last year, at the request of Chengdu's Xicheng District, a group of scholars and experts led by economist Lin Ling conducted research on the district's urban functions. Their proposed strategy of "establishing a high-level production structure and a coordinated economic structure with the third industry, real estate, and high-tech, deep-processing industries as the mainstay" has become the district's work goal.

	In serving the grassroots, the Sichuan Provincial Social Sciences Association does not merely collect data and write a few papers. Instead, they act as both designers and construction workers, providing various types of information to local officials, facilitating connections, and promoting horizontal cooperation. This approach not only contributes to the development of local economies but also deepens their research topics.

    研究课题  提供信息  横向联合
    四川社科联为基层经济发展服务
    成果显著受到社会的肯定和欢迎
    新华社成都12月24日电　（记者史春东、通讯员黄兵）四川省社科联近年来组织几十个学会的上百名社会科学工作者，深入一些市县，以发展地乡经济为目标开展课题研究，直接为基层服务，受到社会的肯定和欢迎。
    四川省社科联下属学会、研究会一百余个，文、史、哲、经专业齐全、人才荟萃。1986年他们组织近十个学会、研究会的几十位专家学者深入到经济贫困的荥经县与农民和基层干部同吃同住，围绕这个县的经济发展组织课题研究，经过一年多努力，完成了《荥经县商品经济发展战略研究》的课题。这个县在实践这些研究成果的过程中，工作重点由注重发展速度转到注重“经济发展质量”上来，结果经济效益大大提高，县财政收入与1986年相比，每年递增20％左右，农民人均收入接近600元。
    第二年省社科联组织60多位社会科学工作者对四川新兴工业城市广元的经济发展进行了探讨，并将这一研究列入省哲学社会科学“七五”规划重点项目。研究人员通过调查研究，搞出近20项课题报告，受到广元市的高度重视。去年受成都市西城区的委托，以经济学家林凌为首的一批学者专家又对这一地区的城市功能进行了研究。他们提出的“建立以第三产业、房地产业和高技术、深加工工业为主体的高层次生产结构和协调的经济结构”的战略规划，已成为这个区的工作目标。
    四川省社科联在为基层服务中不是只取一些数据，完成几篇论文而了事，而是既当设计师，又做施工员，给基层工作同志提供各类信息，进行牵线搭桥，开展横向联合。这样做，既为发展当地经济做出了贡献，又深化了他们的课题研究。
