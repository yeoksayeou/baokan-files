Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 21st — The national conference on raising funds for education and improving school conditions in Shandong was held today in Jinan. Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor, proposed at the conference that the shift from relying solely on the state to the broad masses of the people jointly managing education is a significant change in ideology and educational guidance. Practice has proven that "the people manage education, and education serves the people" is a path of educational development that suits China's national conditions.

The conference, jointly organized by the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance, began on December 17th. Leaders and responsible officials from the education and finance departments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government visited various places in Shandong Province to learn about the province's efforts in raising funds to improve school conditions. Starting today, more than 200 representatives will gather to exchange and discuss experiences and methods of raising funds for education from multiple channels nationwide.

At the meeting, Li Tieying, on behalf of Premier Li Peng, presented a banner to the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Government on behalf of the State Council. The State Planning Commission, State Education Commission, and Ministry of Finance jointly awarded a banner to the Shandong Provincial Government with the inscription "Rely on the people to manage education, manage education for the people." Li Tieying said that this banner embodies respect for the people of Shandong and is an award to the 80 million people of Shandong Province.

Li Tieying said in his speech that education is both a national cause and a people's cause. It concerns the future and destiny of the nation and the growth of children and grandchildren in every family. Therefore, developing education is not only the responsibility of the state but also an irresponsible responsibility of families and society. He emphasized that currently, we are a poor country managing a large-scale education system. To resolve this contradiction, we must have new ideas and methods. The practice in various places has proven that adhering to the policy of "walking on two legs," giving full play to the initiative of both the central and local governments, mobilizing the strength of the whole society, opening up multiple channels, and raising funds from various sources are successful experiences in improving school conditions and developing the education cause.

Li Tieying required that each locality should combine with its own actual situation, learn from the experience of Shandong and other places in raising funds from multiple channels and improving school conditions, mobilize and rely on the masses to manage education well. At the same time, adhere to the socialist direction of running schools, put moral education in the first place, comprehensively improve the quality of education, and cultivate generation after generation of socialist builders and successors, so as not to disappoint the expectations of the Party and the people for education.

    李铁映代表国务院向山东赠旗
    依靠人民办教育  办好教育为人民
    全国筹资办学山东现场会在济南举行
    据新华社济南12月21日电　（记者刘关权、赵卫）全国筹措教育经费改善办学条件山东现场会今天在济南举行大会。中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映在会上提出，教育从单纯由国家统包下来到广大人民群众共同兴办，是观念上和教育指导思想上的重大转变。事实证明，人民办教育，教育为人民，是符合我国国情的教育发展道路。
    由国家教委和财政部共同举办的这次现场会于本月17日开始，来自全国各省、自治区、直辖市的领导和教育、财政部门的负责人分六路考察了山东省多方筹资改善办学条件的情况，从今天起，200多名代表集中交流和讨论全国多渠道筹资办学的经验和方法。
    会上，李铁映受李鹏总理委托代表国务院表彰了山东省委、省政府。国家计委、国家教委、财政部联合奖给山东省政府一面上书“依靠人民办教育，办好教育为人民”的锦旗。李铁映说，这凝聚着对山东人民的敬意，也是对山东省8000万人民的奖励。
    李铁映在讲话中说，教育既是国家的事业，也是人民的事业，既关系到国家的前途命运，也关系到千家万户子孙后代的成长。因此，发展教育不但国家负有责任，家庭、社会同样负有不可推卸的责任。他强调，目前我们是穷国办大教育，要解决这个矛盾，必须有新的思路和办法。各地的实践证明，坚持两条腿走路的方针，发挥中央和地方两个积极性，动员全社会力量，广开渠道，多方集资，是改善办学条件、发展教育事业的成功经验。
    李铁映要求各地要结合本地实际，学习山东等地在多渠道筹资、改善办学条件方面的经验，发动和依靠群众办好教育。同时要坚持社会主义办学方向，把德育放在首位，全面提高教育质量，培养出一代又一代社会主义建设者和接班人，以不辜负党和人民对教育所寄予的期望。
