The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly today adopted three resolutions on the Middle East situation by a majority or overwhelming majority. The resolutions call for an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations to seek a comprehensive and just solution to the Middle East problem.

The first resolution demands that Israel completely withdraw from all Arab territories it has occupied since 1967 and reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to establish an independent state in Palestine.

The Assembly believes that the strategic cooperation agreement signed between the United States and Israel in 1981, as well as the continued supply of modern weapons and equipment to Israel and the substantial economic aid provided, have emboldened Israel's aggression and expansionism. This has had an adverse effect on efforts to establish a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East and has endangered the security of the region.

The second resolution declares that Israel's continued occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights and other Arab territories violates international law. It calls on all member states to immediately cease all dealings with Israel to isolate it.

The third resolution states that Israel's imposition of its judicial and administrative authority over the city of Jerusalem is illegal. It calls on countries that have diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw their missions.

    本届联大通过三项中东局势决议
    要求以色列撤出阿拉伯领土  呼吁召开中东和平国际会议
    本报联合国12月4日电  记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天以多数或压倒多数通过了关于中东局势的三项决议，要求在联合国主持下召开中东问题国际和平会议，寻求全面、公正地解决中东问题。
    第一项决议要求以色列完全撤出1967年以来所占领的阿拉伯领土，并重申巴勒斯坦人民在巴勒斯坦解放组织领导下在巴勒斯坦建立一个独立国家的权利。
    大会认为美国和以色列在1981年签订的战略合作协定以及继续向以色列供应现代武器和装备，并用大量经济援助予以支持，助长了以色列的侵略和扩张气焰，对在中东建立全面、公正、持久和平的努力产生不利影响，并危及该地区的安全。
    第二项决议宣布以色列继续占领叙利亚戈兰高地和其它阿拉伯领土违反了国际法，并呼吁所有会员国立即停止同以色列的一切来往，以孤立以色列。
    第三项决议确定以色列将其司法权和行政权强加于耶路撒冷城的决定是非法的，并呼吁在该城派驻外交使团的国家撤出其使团。
