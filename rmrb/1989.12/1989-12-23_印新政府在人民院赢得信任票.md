The new government led by Prime Minister V.P. Singh won a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) on December 21.

The motion of confidence proposed by Singh was passed by a voice vote. Except for the opposition Congress Party (I) and its allies abstaining, there were no objections.

Singh was invited by President Venkataraman to form the government on December 1. However, the National Front led by Singh did not secure a majority in the Lok Sabha in the elections held at the end of November. The president required Singh to win a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha within a month of forming the government.

    印新政府在人民院赢得信任票
    维·普·辛格总理领导的新政府二十一日在人民院（议会下院）赢得了信任票。
    辛格提出的这项信任票动议由口头表决通过。除反对党国大党（英）及其联盟弃权外，没有人表示反对。
    辛格十二月一日应总统文卡塔拉曼的邀请出任总理并组建政府。但他领导的全国阵线在十一月底的选举中未能获得人民院中过半数的议席，总统要求辛格在组成政府后一个月内在人民院赢得信任票。
