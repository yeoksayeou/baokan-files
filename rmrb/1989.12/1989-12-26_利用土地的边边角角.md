How to Cherish Every Inch of Land?

Making Use of Every Inch of Land

Zhejiang Province, Zhoushan City, Ding Boming

In the past, the private plots of land in China were often far from the villages, scattered and uneven, and not as fertile as the collective fields. However, under the social conditions of that time, through the diligent cultivation of the broad masses of farmers, these "scraps" of land, whether in growth or yield, were often better than the collective fields. Walking on the rural paths, looking at the edges of the fields, ditches, and slopes, everywhere you could see vegetables, fruits, and crops, making the scenery beautiful and abundant.

However, in recent years, the feelings of many farmers towards their private plots have changed. Since they have been assigned responsibility fields, they have abandoned the private plots they used to cultivate carefully. Now, the "golden boards" are overgrown with weeds everywhere. Some farmer brothers, however, pay no attention to this, saying, "Those few patches of land on the slopes don't amount to much." Indeed, for a single household, a few cents or fractions of an acre of private plot may not seem like much, but for our country, which has a large population and a severe shortage of arable land, this is a significant waste.

    利用土地的边边角角
    浙江省舟山市　丁伯明
    我国农家过去的自留地大都远离村庄，零零碎碎，不如集体的大田那么平整肥沃，但在当时的社会环境下，经过广大农民的精耕细作，却出现了一个非常奇特的现象：这些作为土地的“边角余料”，无论在长势和收成上都要好于当时集体的大田。走在乡间的小路上，环顾田头地脑，渠埂坎坡，到处是瓜果菜蔬，葵菽桑麻，美不胜收。
    然而，最近几年，不少农民对自留地的感情发生了变化。他们自从有了责任田后，便把过去精心经营的自留地给丢弃了。“刮金板”如今到处杂草丛生。对此，一些农民兄弟却不屑一顾，还说什么：“那点坎坎坡坡地也算不了什么。”确实，对于一家一户来说，几厘几分自留地也算不了什么，但是对于我们这样一个人口众多、可耕地十分紧缺的国家来说，这就是一种很大的浪费了。
