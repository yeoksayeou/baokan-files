The first batch of 211 senior technicians are all outstanding craftsmen, technical experts, and innovators in their respective fields. The oldest is Guo Wancang, a chef at Shanghai Hengshan Hotel, who is 62 years old. His French cuisine has been praised by foreign heads of state and senior leaders of the Party Central Committee. The youngest is Liu Zhongrong, a worker at Shanghai Jade Carving Factory, who is only 31 years old but has been in the jade carving industry for 14 years. With his skillful hands, he has created hundreds of millions of yuan in production value and nearly one hundred million yuan in foreign exchange earnings for the country in recent years.

The wisdom and talent of the broad masses of technician workers have been respected by the Party and the state. Ni Zhifu and Ma Wenrui attended the certificate awarding ceremony.

    本报讯　记者莫新元报道：全国首批高级技师颁发证书大会于15日上午在北京人民大会堂隆重举行。会前，国务院总理李鹏以及倪志福、宋健、马文瑞等领导同志在中南海亲切会见了211位获得高级技师职务的技术工人。李鹏代表党中央、国务院，向他们表示热烈的祝贺。他说，祖国的社会主义现代化事业，要全心全意依靠工人阶级，改革开放和治理整顿，也要全心全意依靠工人阶级。工人是企业的主体，要把企业搞好，就要提倡工人不仅要有高度的政治觉悟，还要热爱本职工作，要有精湛的技艺。
    自1987年国务院批准《关于实行技师聘任制的暂行规定》以来，考评技师的试点工作已经在全国各地区、各部门普遍展开。今年5月以来，劳动部又会同机械电子工业部、航空航天工业部、轻工业部、国家旅游局、中国人民银行的主管部门，在39家企业进行试点，经严格考核，评出了211名高级技师。被聘任的高级技师，享受高级技师职务津贴，还享受高级专业技术人员相应待遇。
    首批211名高级技师，都是各行业的能工巧匠、技术尖子、革新能手。最年长的是上海衡山宾馆的厨师郭万棠，今年62岁，他烹饪的法式西菜多次受到外国元首及老一辈中央领导同志赞誉。最年轻的是上海玉石雕刻厂的工人刘忠荣，年仅31岁，已从事玉雕行业14个年头。他用那巧夺天工的手，近几年来为国家创造了几百万元产值和近百万元外汇收入。
    广大技师工人的智慧和才干，受到了党和国家的尊重。倪志福、马文瑞等出席了发证大会。
