The 1989 National Invention Awards were announced today in Beijing, with 150 major scientific research achievements receiving awards. Among them, there were 14 second-prize winners, 66 third-prize winners, and 70 fourth-prize winners.

A notable feature of these award-winning projects is their outstanding novelty, high degree of innovation, ingenious design, and high comprehensive technical level. Some of the achievements are international firsts, reaching the leading edge of international technology. The "Two-Phase Flow Design Theory and Method for Centrifugal Pumps" by Cai Baoyuan of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics won a second prize. This invention effectively solves the problems of low efficiency and severe corrosion in various types of pumps containing solid impurities. If the centrifugal pumps designed by him replace various types of pumps, significant benefits in water conservation, energy conservation, and equipment savings can be achieved. This invention solves a scientific problem that has not been addressed internationally and is known as the "Cai Theory" by domestic and foreign scholars.

Another feature of this batch of award-winning projects is their focus on national economic construction and solving practical production problems, with significant economic benefits. For example, the "Reduced-Pressure Nitrogen-Filled Direct-Pull Silicon Single Crystal Technology," which won a second prize, was the first in the world to use the more economical nitrogen gas to replace argon gas as a protective gas for silicon single crystal production. This overcame the technical bias that nitrogen reacts with silicon and cannot be used as a protective gas. A complete set of technologies for controlling direct-pull silicon single crystals under nitrogen protection was developed. Using this technology can reduce harmful impurities in silicon to below the detection sensitivity of infrared detection, reaching an advanced international level in the technology of preparing low-carbon silicon single crystals. This breakthrough not only will have an important impact on promoting the development of silicon materials science but has already created economic benefits of nearly 40 million yuan. According to preliminary statistics of this batch of award-winning projects, a total economic benefit of approximately 26.4 billion yuan has been created.

It is reported that among the award winners this year, there is a welcome phenomenon: the proportion of young inventors has significantly increased. There are 62 inventors under the age of 40, accounting for 12.6% of the total number of award winners; the youngest inventor is only 25 years old.

The complete list of these award-winning projects will be published in the December 19th issue of the *Science and Technology Daily*.

    1989年度国家发明奖揭晓
    150项科研成果获奖
    本报北京12月17日讯　记者何黄彪报道：1989年度国家发明奖今天在京揭晓，150项重大科研成果获奖。其中二等奖14项，三等奖66项，四等奖70项。
    这些获奖项目的一个显著特点，是新颖性突出，创新程度大，构思巧妙，综合技术水平高，有的成果属于国际首创，达到国际领先水平。机电部蔡保元获得二等奖的“离心泵的‘二相流’设计理论和方法”，很好地解决了各种杂质泵在含固体的情况下效率低、腐蚀严重的问题，如果用他设计的离心泵取代各种杂质泵，将取得节水、节电、节省设备的显著效益。这项发明解决了国际上尚未解决的科学难题，被国内外学者称为“蔡氏理论”。
    这批获奖项目的另一个特点，是立足于国民经济建设，解决生产中的实际问题，其经济效益显著。如获得二等奖的“减压充氮直拉硅单晶技术”，在世界上首次采用了更为廉价的氮气代替氩气，作为生产硅单晶的保护气，克服了国际上认为氮与硅起化学反应不可作为保护气的技术偏见，发展了一整套氮保护下控制直拉硅单晶的技术。采用这项技术可使硅中有害杂质碳降低到红外检测灵敏度之下，在制备低碳含量硅单晶技术领域达到了国际先进水平。这项突破性进展不仅对推动硅材料科学发展将产生重要作用，而且已创造了近4000万元的经济效益。根据这批获奖项目的初步统计，共创造经济效益264亿元左右。
    据介绍，在今年的获奖人员的队伍中，出现了一个可喜的现象，青年发明人的比例明显增加。40岁以下的发明人共有62位，占整个获奖人数的12.6％；最年轻的发明人只有25岁。
    这批获奖项目全部目录将刊在19日的《科技日报》。
