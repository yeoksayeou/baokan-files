A nutrient that can be directly sprayed on vegetables to achieve significant yield increases has recently been successfully developed and approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry.

Experts believe that this nutrient has reached advanced international levels in several key indicators. Its successful development provides a possible solution for large-scale vegetable production in China.

This biochemical nutrient can timely adjust the coordination between the plant and its environment, extend the harvesting period, and increase yield by more than 20 percent.
