Upon first arriving in Denmark, I was surprised by the sheer number of bicycles here.

I have had the fortune to visit many European countries, but everywhere I went, cars were the dominant sight, with bicycles being quite rare. Denmark, however, is different. Here, you can see bicycles everywhere you go. In the heart of the capital, Copenhagen, bicycles are parked along the streets and in parking lots in abundance. It is not an exaggeration to say that bicycles share the stage with cars as modern means of transportation, making it a unique feature of Denmark's streets.

However, during the time when small cars became common among ordinary people, bicycles in Denmark were once neglected and seemed to be on the verge of disappearing from history. The oil crisis of the 1970s brought bicycles back to the streets of Denmark. At that time, oil prices soared, and the Western economy was in crisis. Many Danes, out of necessity, had to ride bicycles again. However, people soon discovered that bicycles were economical, convenient, and with the addition of a speed-up gear, they could match the speed of cars in the city. Moreover, cycling is a good form of physical exercise. Thus, the trend of cycling grew and has not waned since.

Today, for many Danes, cycling is no longer a temporary measure but an indispensable companion in life. They ride to work, to school, and to the shops, whether in the pleasant summer weather or the bitter winter cold. Some even ride to attend receptions and dinners.

The government, considering the need to ease traffic congestion and reduce pollution, also encourages people to cycle. For this purpose, funds have been allocated to build bicycle lanes on all major streets in the cities, one on each side, about a meter wide, between the car lanes and the sidewalks. Even in the suburbs, many roads have bicycle lanes, winding and endless, as long as the roads themselves.

In addition, the number of traffic lights has been increased, and bicycle parking lots have been opened in cities. Denmark's traffic lights generally have two more devices than in other countries: one for buses and one for bicycles. According to traffic rules, at intersections, buses and bicycles have the right of way, and other vehicles must yield, otherwise, it is a violation of traffic rules.

There is no exact statistics on the number of bicycles in Denmark, but one estimate puts it between two and three million, roughly equal to the number of private cars. Denmark has a population of five million, meaning there is one bicycle for every two people. Due to the large number of cyclists, Denmark's cycling culture is quite widespread. In last year's Seoul Olympics, Denmark won two gold medals, one in its traditional stronghold of sailing and the other in cycling.

    自行车在丹麦
    士平
    初到丹麦，我惊讶于这里的自行车多。
    我曾有幸到过欧洲的不少国家，但触目皆是汽车，自行车极难见到。丹麦的情形就不同了。在这里，你只要出门，随处都可以看到自行车。在首都哥本哈根市中心，停放在街边、停车场内的自行车更是比比皆是。可以毫不夸张地说，自行车与汽车同领现代代步工具之风骚，是丹麦有别于其他西方国家的特色街景之一。
    不过，在小汽车进入寻常百姓家那阵，自行车在丹麦也一度备受冷落，大有完成历史使命从此销声匿迹之势。七十年代初的那场石油危机使自行车重返丹麦街头。当时，石油价格飞涨，西方经济呈现危机，不少丹麦人出于无奈，不得不重新跨上自行车。然而，人们很快发现，骑自行车经济，轻便，安上加快轴在市区行车，其速度也不在汽车之下。除此而外，骑车还是一种良好的身体锻炼。于是，骑车风日盛，并且至今不衰。
    今日，对于许多丹麦人而言，骑车早已不再是权宜之计，而是把它当作生活中不可缺少的伴侣。他们骑车上班、上学、上街，在气候宜人的夏天是如此，在寒风凛冽的冬天也是如此。甚至骑车参加招待会，出席晚宴也不乏其人其事。
    政府从缓解交通和减少污染的角度考虑也鼓励人们骑车，为此还拨出款项在城市的所有主要街道都修建了自行车专道，街左街右各一道，宽约一米，夹在汽车道和人行道之间。甚至郊外的不少公路也修筑了自行车道，曲曲弯弯，绵延无尽，公路有多长，自行车道就有多长。
    此外，增加红绿灯设施和在城市开辟自行车停车场所。丹麦的交通信号灯一般要比其他国家多两个装置，一是专管公共汽车的横竖道信号灯；二是专管自行车的小型红绿灯。按照交通规则，在路口，公共汽车和自行车享有先行权，其他车辆必须礼让，否则就是违反交通规则。
    丹麦一共有多少辆自行车没有确切的统计，一份材料估计在二百万至三百万辆之间，与私人汽车数量差不多。丹麦全国人口为五百万，也就是说，每二人中就有一辆自行车。由于骑自行车的人多，丹麦的自行车运动比较普及。在去年的汉城奥运会上，丹麦一共获得两枚金牌，一枚是传统强项航海，另一枚就是自行车了。
