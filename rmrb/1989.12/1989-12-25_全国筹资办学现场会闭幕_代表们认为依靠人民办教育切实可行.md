The seven-day national conference on fundraising for education and improving school conditions in Shandong Province concluded today.

Representatives from all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and planned cities across the nation agreed that Shandong's experience in fundraising for education is excellent. The success lies in its proposal of a fundamental guiding ideology and approach that suits China's national conditions; the top leadership's focus on education has improved school conditions; the approach of relying on the people to run schools has been proven effective through practice; starting from the poorest areas and rural regions has yielded results. Many representatives from ethnic minority regions drew inspiration from Shandong's experience and expressed their intention to follow the path of mobilizing the masses to raise funds for education.

In his summary, Vice Minister of the State Education Commission He Dongchang said that the conference was well-timed and productive. Through this conference, several points have been clarified: in the reform and development of education, we must adhere to the Party's mass line because the masses indeed harbor great enthusiasm for running schools, and the development of education aligns with the fundamental interests of the masses; further improve and reform the educational management system, establish and improve reasonable systems and regulations, and implement a tiered approach to running and managing schools; to truly improve the quality of education, we must focus on improving school conditions, carry out rectification and reform, and guide the education sector into a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

    全国筹资办学现场会闭幕
    代表们认为依靠人民办教育切实可行
    据新华社济南12月24日电（记者赵卫、刘关权）历时七天的全国筹措教育经费、改善办学条件山东现场会今天闭幕。
    来自全国各省、自治区、直辖市、计划单列市的负责人以及与会代表一致认为，山东省提供的筹资办学经验很好，好就好在提出了符合我国国情的基本指导思想和路子；第一把手抓教育，改善了办学条件；依靠人民办教育这条路子经过实践证明是切实可行的；从最贫困的地方抓起，从农村抓起，抓出了成效。很多民族地区代表从山东经验中得到启示，表示也要走依靠群众多方集资办教育的路子。
    国家教委副主任何东昌在总结中说，这个会开得很好很适时。通过这次会议大家明确了几点：教育在改革和发展中要坚持党的群众路线，因为群众中确实蕴藏着巨大的办学积极性，教育的发展是符合群众的根本利益的；进一步完善和改革教育管理体制，建立健全合理的制度和法规，分级办学，分级管理；真正提高教育质量就要狠抓办学条件的改善，搞好治理整顿，使教育事业转入持续、稳定协调发展的轨道。
