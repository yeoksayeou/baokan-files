    The Unyielding Dai Yuzhen

    In recent years, many coal depots have been established along the public road in the Yousuo Fortress area of Huai'an County in our region. Some of these depots have been falsifying accounts and evading taxes since their inception, making them a difficult area for Huai'an County to collect taxes. Last winter, Dai Yuzhen took on the role of tax collection supervisor for this area. Several of Dai Yuzhen's relatives also operate coal depots here. People watched to see how Dai Yuzhen would collect taxes from her relatives. Dai Yuzhen's cousin, Zhang Ruicheng, partnered with someone else to open a coal depot. On August 7 of this year, Dai Yuzhen collected business tax from Zhang Ruicheng. As soon as they met, Zhang Ruicheng said, "Brother, business has been slow this month. Can you collect less?" Saying this, Zhang Ruicheng took out 200 yuan. Dai Yuzhen did not listen to him and continued to calculate item by item. In the end, Zhang Ruicheng owed 600 yuan in business tax. Zhang Ruicheng became angry, pointing at Dai Yuzhen and saying, "You're too ruthless! Just wait and see!" Three days later, Zhang Ruicheng ran into Dai Yuzhen's courtyard, shouting that he wanted to fight her to the death, and also damaged some of Dai Yuzhen's property. Afterward, the county tax bureau investigated the situation and severely punished Zhang Ruicheng.

    After this incident spread, the broad masses of taxpayers were shaken. Those who originally evaded taxes now voluntarily paid them; those who evaded and owed taxes now voluntarily made up the taxes and fines. From January to September this year, Dai Yuzhen collected 44,476 yuan in taxes for the state in this difficult area for the entire county, an increase of 88% over the same period last year.

    “六亲不认”的代玉珍
    近年来，我地区怀安县右所堡沿公路一带建起了许多煤栈，其中一些煤栈从成立起即搞假帐，偷税漏税，成了怀安县征收税款的难点。去年冬天，代玉珍担任了这一片的税收专管员。代玉珍的几家亲戚也在这里开办煤栈。人们看着代玉珍如何向亲戚征税。代玉珍的表弟张瑞成和别人合办了一个煤栈。今年8月7日，代玉珍向张瑞成征收营业税。一见面，张瑞成就说：“哥，这个月煤栈生意不景气，你就少收点吧！”说着，张瑞成拿出了200元。代玉珍没有听他的，仍一笔一笔地进行核算，结果张瑞成应交纳营业税600元。张瑞成火了，指着代玉珍说：“你做事太绝啦！你等着瞧吧！”事隔3天，张瑞成跑到代玉珍家的院子里，叫嚷着要跟代玉珍拚命，还砸坏代玉珍家的东西。事后，县税务局查明情况，严肃处理了张瑞成。
    这件事传开后，广大纳税户受到震动，原来逃税的，现在主动缴税；偷税欠税的，主动补缴了税款和罚金。今年1至9月，代玉珍在这个全县收税的难点，为国家征收税款44476元，比去年同期增长了88％。
