A new method for quickly reading sheet music has recently emerged in Beijing. This method, known as the "Simple Solfege Method," was invented by Liu Jianping, the principal of Beijing Yi Hua Music School and a violin teacher, and has been granted a national patent.

Experts believe that this new method of reading sheet music solves some long-standing issues in the popularization of sheet music education, filling a gap in sheet music methods.

The 10-episode television series "Dragon Soars Over Wumeng," co-produced by the Xi'an Film Studio and the Guizhou Provincial Government, began filming in Guiyang on December 19th.

This television series is set against the backdrop of the revolutionary wars of the 1930s and sings the praises of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's 26th Army Corps, led by veteran proletarian revolutionaries such as He Long, Ren Bishi, Xiao Ke, and Wang Zhen. It depicts their arduous and unyielding struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries during their Long March through Guizhou, their establishment of the Northwest Guizhou Soviet area and the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou revolutionary base, and showcases the heroic spirit of the Red Army soldiers and the people of various ethnic groups in Guizhou.

Vice President Wang Zhen reviewed the script for "Dragon Soars Over Wumeng," and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong inscribed the title. Member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Xiao Ke wrote the preface.
