The first domestic instant coffee production plant in China, the Haikou Instant Coffee Factory in Hainan Special Economic Zone, has seen its Lishen series of instant coffee products gain popularity both domestically and internationally. This product has consecutively won the Silver Medal at the First China Food Expo and the title of a Major New Product at the National Level in 1989. The factory generates over 6 million yuan in profits and taxes for the state annually, and by increasing production, it can also save the state over 7 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

The establishment and operation of the Haikou Instant Coffee Factory, along with the introduction of the Lishen series of instant coffee products, have broken the monopoly of foreign instant coffee in the Chinese market and have begun to pave the way for Chinese coffee products to enter the global market.
