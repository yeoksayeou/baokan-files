Unattended Destructive Behavior

On December 3 at 11:30 AM, when the reporter was on the 242nd train that stopped at the Weijia Shop station (in the Xiaogan area of Hubei), it was observed that along the 500-meter-long railway tracks, about 50 people were using shovels, picks, and spades to dig up the stones on both sides of the railway sleepers and underneath them. They then used sieves to sift out the coal dust trapped between the stones (this coal dust is from coal trains that spill coal into the stone gaps). It is said that one person can sift out over 100 kilograms a day, and 50 kilograms can be sold for tens of yuan. Most of these stone-digging people are farmers from nearby villages, as well as railway workers and their family members. This random digging and spading within the railway base creates a hidden danger for train derailments. Many passengers saw this scene and were very angry. Strangely, no one in the station stopped this lawless destructive behavior. Reporter Zhang Ya Xin wrote and photographed this article.

    无人过问的破坏行为
    12月3日11时30分，当记者乘坐的242次列车停在京广线卫家店车站（湖北孝感地区）时，发现在该站500米长的铁轨两侧，约有50多人用锹、镐、刨、挖铁轨枕木两侧和枕木下的石块，然后用筛子筛下夹在石块间缝隙里的煤粉（这些煤粉是运煤列车洒落在石缝里的）。据讲一个人一天可筛得上百公斤，每50公斤可卖几十元钱。这些挖石块的人多是来自附近各村的农民，也有铁路职工及其家属。这种在路基内乱挖，乱刨，给列车的颠覆造成隐患。许多旅客见此情景都非常气愤。令人奇怪的是，站内竟无人阻止这种无法无天的破坏行为。本报记者　张雅心撰文摄影
