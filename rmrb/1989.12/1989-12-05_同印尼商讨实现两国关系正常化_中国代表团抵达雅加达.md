A Chinese delegation arrived in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, this evening to discuss the normalization of relations between China and Indonesia. The delegation was welcomed at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport by the Indonesian delegation led by Rohana Kopo, Director General of the Political Affairs Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other officials.

The Chinese delegation, consisting of 10 members, was led by Xu Dunxin, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Asian Affairs Department. The delegation was welcomed by Rohana Kopo and other officials.

This is the first time in 22 years, since the interruption of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia on October 30, 1967, that a Chinese delegation has come to Jakarta to discuss the normalization of relations with the Indonesian side.

At a press conference held at the airport, Xu Dunxin, head of the Chinese delegation, said: In February of this year, Indonesian President Suharto and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks in Tokyo, where major and principled issues regarding the normalization of relations between China and Indonesia were resolved, and the process of normalization has begun. Therefore, the main purpose of this round of talks is to address technical issues. He believes that with the joint efforts of both countries, these issues will not be difficult to resolve.

Rohana Kopo, head of the Indonesian delegation, told reporters that the issues to be discussed are not difficult to resolve and that they aim to settle these issues in one go, without taking too much time.

He expressed confidence in the prospects of this round of talks.
