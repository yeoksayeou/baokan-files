The Selfless Liu Factory Director
For the development of the enterprise, he sacrifices his family for the greater good, boldly reforms, and is praised by the people

In 1981, Liu Hongming took over as the director of Yinan Shoe Factory, which had been shut down for half a year. He decided to use the existing equipment to produce a new product: adhesive sole canvas shoes. To ensure the new product could be launched as soon as possible, he and the research team lived and worked at the research site. At this critical moment, his eldest daughter was diagnosed with leukemia and hospitalized in Qingdao, while his son was diagnosed with infantile paralysis. Faced with the difficulties at home and at the factory, Liu Hongming continued to work at the research site, designing blueprints and organizing the modification and debugging of equipment. With the efforts of all the workers day and night, the transformation was completed in just one month, and the first batch of new products was produced. The factory was saved, but his 8-year-old daughter passed away without being able to see her father one last time, and his son was left with sequelae due to delayed medical treatment.

In the spring of 1984, to develop the second-generation injection-molded shoes, he and several deputy directors and technicians conducted investigations in 13 provinces and cities and drafted a plan for the research and development of imitation leather sandals. Due to overwork, his original throat condition worsened, and he eventually lost his ability to speak. After surgery and one week of hospitalization, he returned to the research site. Unable to speak, he used a pen to direct the work. In this way, he led the cadres and workers to devote all their energy to the work, ensuring the successful trial production and timely launch of imitation leather sandals. After the product was launched, it generated more than 300,000 yuan in taxes and profits that year and won the regional scientific and technological progress achievement award.

In 1988, the factory achieved its best economic performance, but it was also a year of great hardship and heavy burdens for Liu's family. His sister was diagnosed with stomach cancer and hospitalized, and his mother suffered a stroke and was also hospitalized. Two family members were in the hospital at the same time, but he gritted his teeth and did not let it affect his work. The medical expenses for the two family members amounted to more than 4,000 yuan, and he personally bore 2,500 yuan. To pay for their treatment, he sold his three-room house in his hometown. In 1988, Liu Hongming fulfilled all the contracts he signed with deputy directors and various contracted units by the end of the year. Some received bonuses of more than 4,000 yuan, but Liu Hongming only received 1,200 yuan, which was below the factory average. Due to the outstanding economic performance of the enterprise, the county committee and county government awarded Liu Hongming a bonus of 290,000 yuan according to the contract. When outsiders privately discussed how he would use the bonus, he voluntarily paid 13,478 yuan in personal income adjustment tax to the state, and the rest was used for enterprise production.

Liu Hongming cares for the people. He helped 23 unmarried young people find partners and start families; he arranged for 65 children of workers to go to school. Every year during the busy farming season, he organized work teams to help workers from rural areas with their farmwork. In 1981, the per capita income of the entire factory was only 360 yuan, but by 1988, it had increased to 2,370 yuan. Which worker was not happy? Which worker was not grateful to Director Liu? At the award ceremony in 1988, several old workers suddenly carried a plaque with the words "For the factory's takeoff, enduring hardships, with a mother's heart for the workers" onto the stage and presented it to Liu Hongming. The entire audience erupted in applause, and the workers' eyes welled up with tears.

Liu Hongming, with his selfless dedication, led the entire factory's cadre team to build a strong work ethic, generating an inner force of sincere respect, making the enterprise full of vitality. The economic benefits increased for seven consecutive years, accumulating 10.55 million yuan in taxes and profits, equivalent to earning back 42 shoe factories before 1981; the number of workers increased from 41 to more than 1,500, making it one of the largest canvas shoe and tourist shoe production factories in the country. In 1988, the absolute economic benefit ranked first in the country, and it was the first in the industry to be promoted to a national second-level enterprise.

In 1985, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions awarded Liu Hongming the title of "National Reformer" and presented him with the "May 1st Labor Medal" and certificate; in 1986, he was named a Labor Model of Shandong Province; in 1988, he was awarded the title of "National Light Industry Labor Model" by the Ministry of Light Industry; this year, he was awarded the title of "National Labor Model" by the State Council.

    公而忘私的刘厂长
    为企业发展，舍小家，顾大家，大胆改革，受到人们称赞
    刘洪明1981年担任沂南制鞋总厂厂长时，鞋厂已停产半年。他决定利用原有设备改产粘胶底布鞋新产品。为使新产品尽快问世，他与攻关小组一起吃住在科研现场。正当此刻，他的大女儿因患白血病住进了青岛医院，他的男孩又患了婴儿瘫。在家难与厂难面前，刘洪明照常投入科研现场，一面设计图纸，一面组织改装调试。经全体职工昼夜奋战，仅用1个月的时间就完成了转产工作，生产出第一代新产品。工厂得救了，可他年仅8岁的大女儿却带着没能够最后看上父亲一眼的遗憾，被病魔夺去了生命，儿子也因送医院过晚，留下了后遗症。
    1984年春，为开发第二代注塑鞋，他与几位副厂长和技术人员先后到13个省市进行考察，主持制定了研制仿革注塑凉鞋计划。由于过分劳累，导致喉部原有的病症更加严重，最后说不出话来。手术后住院治疗才1周，他便回到科研现场。不能说话，便用笔指挥。就这样，率领干部职工将全部身心投入工作之中，保证了仿皮凉鞋试制成功并按期投入生产。产品投产后，当年创利税30多万元，获地区科技进步成果奖。
    1988年是鞋厂经济效益最好的一年，可也是他家庭多难、负担繁重的一年，他姐姐不幸患胃癌住院，母亲也因患脑血栓偏瘫住院，一家医院同时住着两个亲人，他硬咬着牙没影响工作。两个亲人住院费4000多元，他一人就承担了2500元。为给亲人治病，他卖掉老家的三间房子。1988年，刘洪明与副厂长和各承包单位签订的合同年底全部兑现，多者获年奖4000多元，可刘洪明仅拿了1200元奖金，低于全厂平均数。由于企业经济效益突出，县委、县政府按承包合同兑现给刘洪明奖金2.9万元。当外界私下议论他所得奖金如何安排用场时，他主动向国家交纳个人收入调节税13478元，其余全部用于企业生产。
    刘洪明关心群众。他为23名大龄青年牵线搭桥建立了家庭；他安排了65名职工子女上学。每年农忙季节，他都成立帮工队，为家在农村的职工收种责任田。1981年全厂人均收入只有360元，1988年增加到2370元。哪一个工人不高兴！哪一个工人不感激刘厂长！1988年发奖大会上，几个老工人突然抬着一块绣有“为鞋厂腾飞历尽艰辛，待职工一片慈母之心”的横匾上台送给刘厂长，全场爆发出“哗、哗”的掌声，工人们的眼眶湿润了。
    刘洪明凭着无私奉献的精神，带动全厂干部队伍进行思想作风建设，产生了心悦诚服的内在感召力，使企业充满活力，经济效益连续7年增加，累计创利税1055万元，等于赚回1981年前的42个鞋厂；职工由41人发展到1500多人，在全国列于大型布鞋、旅游鞋生产厂家。1988年经济效益绝对数列全国同行业第一名，在全国同行业率先升为国家二级企业。
    1985年，中华全国总工会授予刘洪明“全国致力改革者”称号，并颁发了“五一”劳动奖章和证书；1986年他被评为山东省劳动模范；1988年被轻工部授予“全国轻工业劳动模范”称号；今年又被国务院授予“全国劳动模范”称号。
