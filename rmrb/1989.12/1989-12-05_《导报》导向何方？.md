**The World Economic Herald has long been advocating for bourgeois liberalization.**

**The Herald has been vigorously promoting privatization in the economy. It uses the introduction of the "privatization wave" in Western countries and the "success of the Asian Four Little Dragons" to glorify private ownership, denigrate and negate public ownership, and cite the views of so-called "elites" that China's way out lies in private ownership, providing theoretical support for privatization.**

**Advocating for political pluralism is another important direction of the Herald. For a period, the newspaper has been filled with articles that reject the Party's leadership, and under the banner of "freedom of speech," it attempts to shake off the Party's leadership.**

**After the Party and the government proposed the task of rectification and austerity, some individuals who insist on bourgeois liberalization used the Herald's platform to stir up a cold wind against rectification and austerity. They separate reform and opening up from rectification and austerity, opposing them, and claim that rectification and austerity hinder reform, revealing their view of reforming China with a capitalist approach.**

**During the political turmoil in the spring and summer of this year, the World Economic Herald stirred up trouble and became a source of turmoil from the perspective of public opinion. People cannot help but ask: How did the World Economic Herald get so deeply involved in this turmoil? Ice does not freeze in a day. The direction of the Herald has long been advocating for bourgeois liberalization, unremittingly.**

**Promoting Economic Privatization to Change the Socialist Nature**

**The Herald vigorously promotes privatization in the economy. Flipping through its pages, there are prominent headlines such as "Public Ownership is Reaching its End in the World," "The Privatization Wave Sweeps the Globe," "Where is Public Ownership Heading?," "Personalization of State-Owned Assets: The Trend and Choice of China's Economic Reform," etc. From these headlines, we can see its obvious bias.**

**The Herald creates public opinion for private ownership using a method of starting from afar. Its reports state: "The privatization wave began in the 1980s and now sweeps the globe." "Britain is the pioneer of global privatization," "Japan's privatization amount is the highest," France, Italy, Spain are all selling state-owned company assets and shares. This propaganda aims to make people believe that state-owned companies have no future, and privatization is the current global trend.**

**The Herald also uses the words of foreigners to say that the most important factor in the success of the "Asian Four Little Dragons" is "providing residents with considerable personal economic freedom and strictly implementing private property rights." "The biggest problem with socialism is not knowing what socialism is, not knowing how to define socialism, and the superiority of public ownership is not clear." By comparison, the direction of the Herald is clear. However, this hides a basic fact, that is, capitalist countries are just a joint management committee of the bourgeoisie, and their "public" to private, is just a form of monopoly capital transforming into another form.**

**Our country is a socialist country, and public ownership is the most basic characteristic of the socialist economic system. According to the national conditions of China's primary stage of socialism, private economy plays an important role in developing social production, facilitating people's lives, and expanding employment, and should be encouraged to develop actively within the scope allowed by the state. But we must also consider the blind and selfish aspects of the private economy and limit its negative effects on the development of socialist economy. However, the articles published in the Herald believe that "the extremely important historical role of the private economy can be summarized as motive force, vitality, main force, self-interest, national interest, and public interest." Immediately, it is proposed that the private economy should "not be restricted by the proportion, scope, and scale of development." It praises private ownership as if it were a fairy, a panacea.**

**Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "The proportion and scope of the non-public economy in China's national economy should be determined according to China's actual level of productive forces and objective needs, and cannot simply be used as a measure of reform achievements." In the eyes of some people, it seems that the unlimited development of the private economy is a great progress in reform, which is a one-sided and extremely wrong view. Some people on the Herald also propose: "If the household contract responsibility system is the first step of rural reform, then the development of the private economy should be the second urgent reform for China." "In China's vast rural areas, the private economy should become the main force for the development of productive forces." In fact, it is to let public ownership give way to the vast rural areas, and let the private economy dominate everything. If it really comes to that, the planned arrangement of grain and economic crops will be completely broken, and the state will not be able to effectively guarantee the necessary raw materials. Once grain, cotton, oil, aquatic products, silk, medicine, tea, tobacco leaves, and other important materials are controlled by individuals, there will be a situation of price gouging, monopoly, and price slashing of agricultural products, and the interests of the state and farmers will be seriously damaged. Rural and urban areas are inseparable, and once the private economy dominates the rural areas, the urban public economy will inevitably be constrained. Then, the fundamental position of public ownership will be shaken.**

**Not only that, the Herald also published articles openly advocating privatization. They claim: "Various plans have been tried, but they dare not try the most effective and simplest plan proven by the history of more than a hundred countries and thousands of years in the world—private ownership." There was also a so-called "Research Seminar on the Crisis of Public Ownership," which actually proposed that "public ownership has reached the stage of being denied." "The way out in the future is privatization." For the above-mentioned proposals that openly deny the socialist economic system, the Herald even calls them "insightful views" and "refreshing."**

**The Herald also promotes private ownership through foreign scholars. For example, a foreign scholar suggested that the assets held by the government be turned into capital for various levels of government, foundations, associations, and individuals, who can freely transfer among themselves. In other words, turn the state's assets into the ownership of local governments, small groups, and individuals, which is a strategy to disintegrate public ownership. The Herald opens up space to introduce and promote it.**

**Obviously, the beautification of private ownership is aimed at negating public ownership. In the Herald, Xian Jiya wrote: "The biggest problem at present is to reform the ownership system and actively develop private ownership. Corruption is related to public ownership." The Herald's reporter Zhang Weiguo also criticized public ownership, believing that "public ownership has corrupted the entire nation, society, and the cadre team." They depict public ownership as a disaster. According to the logic of Xian Jiya and others, public ownership must be changed to private ownership for China to have a way out and a future, which is not to regress to the old China?**

**Since the founding of the country, socialist construction in China has been thriving and has achieved remarkable achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. Public ownership has shown its vitality. Of course, our work has also had mistakes, but the problem is not with public ownership itself, but with the specific management system (including macro and micro operating mechanisms) that still has some defects, hindering the further development of the superiority of socialist public ownership. Under the current conditions, in addition to exploring how to develop individual and private economies under socialism, it is important to study how to make public ownership full of vitality, especially how to further develop the vitality of state-owned enterprises, how to adjust the industrial structure, how to improve enterprise management, how to truly reflect the principle of distribution according to work in socialism, overcome income inequality, and how to mobilize the production enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of all employees, etc. It is in this sense that we carry out reform. And our reform is to perfect public ownership, not to weaken or negate public ownership.**

**In recent years, there have been extremely disgusting phenomena of corruption in society. Some stubborn individuals who insist on the position of bourgeois liberalization think they have found a handle to slander public ownership, and the theory that public ownership produces corruption has emerged. However, in the several decades since the founding of the country, there was no phenomenon of "official profiteering" and corruption for a relatively long period, which shows that public ownership is not necessarily related to corruption. The emergence of corruption in recent years has complex causes, one of which is the rampant bourgeois liberalization ideology, the view that "everything is for money" is considered normal, selfishness prevails, and some people use power for personal gain, turning power into wealth. We criticize bourgeois liberalization, reject all forms of individualism for money, which is an important way to prevent corruption. Xian Jiya and Zhang Weiguo blame public ownership for corruption, hiding the fact that bourgeois liberalization ideology is the ideological root cause of corruption, which is a reversal of cause and effect.**

**While promoting privatization, the Herald calls for China to have a "middle class," claiming that it "is active at the micro level and does not need any imposition. In pursuing its own interests, it itself represents long-term interests." Some people envision "realizing the personalization of state-owned assets, turning the assets originally belonging to the people from the form of state ownership to the form of direct personal ownership." In fact, the theory of the so-called "middle class" is a Western saying about social strata, a theory that blurs class relations. Bringing this theory to China is only to replace Marxist class analysis, negate the working class and the alliance between workers and peasants, and provide a class basis for their privatization. The result can only be to summon a group of people who can turn public into private, using cunning and robbery to devour state public assets and become a new bourgeoisie. That is, to use the blood and sweat of the working people to re-cultivate and fatten a bourgeoisie, attempting to make the people of all ethnic groups in China become slaves of both foreign capital and domestic exploiters again. From this, it can be seen that the so-called "insisting on reform" repeatedly advocated by some leaders of the Herald is actually insisting on that kind of reform that deviates from the socialist direction.**

**Advocating for Political Pluralism to Shake Off the Party's Leadership**

**Political "pluralism" is a euphemism used by those who stubbornly insist on the position of bourgeois liberalization to reject and abolish the leadership of the Communist Party of China and attempt to establish an opposition party. They dare not say it directly, so they use the word "pluralism" to cover it up. The Herald uses the reporting of foreign news to inject its own soul, such as "Pluralistic Politics: The Road to Successful Reform," "The Thought of Multi-party System Brings New Vitality to... Society," "Socialism Should Protect the Position of the Opposition," using titles to write articles, which is a typical example of using foreign news to express one's own views. "Using other people's wine cups to vent one's heartache."**

**For a period of time, the Herald has been filled with articles rejecting the Party's leadership, such as proposing that "political system reform should take power pluralism as the principle"; "The success or failure of reform is fundamentally marked by whether a certain balance and pluralistic political situation have emerged." "Economic pluralism is the basis of political pluralism and the basis of modern political parties." The implication is that since there is a private economy, there should also be political factions or even parties representing their interests, creating public opinion for the establishment of an opposition party.**

**In the "Initial Thoughts on China's Reform in the Next Ten Years" published in the Herald, Wen Yuanke and others maliciously proposed: "The Party manages the Party's affairs, the Party raises Party funds, the Party rectifies the Party's style, the Party contains the Party and factions." This means that the Communist Party of China should manage its own affairs, collect its own funds, and rectify its own style. You should allow other parties to exist! Here, the leadership position of the Communist Party of China is completely erased. "The Party contains the Party and factions," this sentence seems confusing. China is not without various democratic parties? "The Party contains the Party and factions" is not a waste of words? Obviously, Wen Yuanke's intention is implied, that is, to allow the existence of an opposition party.**

**An article in the Herald says, "Political parties are just a social organization within the scope of the state, and are covered by the concept of the state. It is just a small circle within a big circle." Creating such public opinion aims to reduce the leadership position of the Communist Party of China, which has been established in the long-term practice of the Chinese revolution, to just an ordinary social organization, and does not allow it to lead other organizations. Some articles even propose: "To change the simple leadership and being led relationship between the Party and social organizations, and to make various social organizations truly become relatively independent political forces." In other words, to reject the Party's leadership over the trade unions, the Communist Youth League, etc. Let each social organization "independently" come out and fight for independence from the Party, actually attempting to make it evolve into an opposition party. It is known to all that in the international arena, which ruling party does not play an important role in the major policies and reforms of the state? The ruling party is not an ordinary organization. In our country, the leadership position of the Communist Party of China is formed by history, and its merits in promoting historical progress, systematic and profound theoretical basis, and accumulated experience are unparalleled by other political forces. Therefore, hundreds of millions of people have expressed that "without the Communist Party, there would be no new China," reflecting the people's trust in our Party. The Party has also made mistakes, but this is not only unavoidable in the exploration of creating a new society for mankind, but also the Party has mainly relied on its own strength to correct the mistakes and rectify the course. Such as the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, which rectified the wrongs, returned to the correct path, and brought vigorous vitality and vitality to our socialist motherland. The reform and opening up in the past ten years have been seen by all. However, the leaders of the Herald, who stubbornly insist on the position of bourgeois liberalization, have ulterior motives for the Party, and strive to create public opinion to shake off the Party's leadership. The editor-in-chief of the Herald, Qin Benli, proposed in an interview with a foreign newspaper to "fade out the Party's leadership" and "must change the idea that the Party leads everything." In the Herald, there are also such arguments: "It is necessary to allow the existence and speech of political opposition parties." When Qin Benli's wrong remarks were criticized, he still insisted on his own views and said: "The Party cannot lead everything, I still think so. Can the Party lead the sun?" The indignation is evident. A party member for many years, an old journalist who has been the editor-in-chief of a newspaper for many years, how can he be like this? In addition to showing that he can no longer suppress his long-cherished desire to shake off the Party's leadership and his wanton ridicule of the Party, what else can it show?**

**Under the banner of "freedom of speech," attempting to shake off the Party's leadership is an important move of the Herald. It is said that "speech is as free as thought." "What is freedom of speech? The affirmative aspect is that people can say whatever they want, and the negative aspect is that people's speech should not be subject to others, that is, people should not be punished for their speech." "When people solemnly set rules and frameworks for freedom of speech, they may not realize that this has already violated the constitution." This "freedom" is really a fairy tale, a freedom that has never existed in the world, even in the so-called "free world" of capitalism. The laws of the bourgeoisie stipulate that freedom is based on not harming the interests of others. Montesquieu said it clearly, "Freedom is the right to do everything that the law allows." In our country, "freedom of speech" is freedom under the premise of the entire constitution, it must conform to the four cardinal principles, and it must be beneficial to socialist modernization construction. Without this general premise, it does not conform to the constitution; it is not to say whatever you want. Engaging in counter-revolutionary incitement, spreading rumors and slanders, has it ever been "speech"? The law clearly stipulates that such acts should be punished. The legal provisions of many countries in the world also list speech aimed at subverting the state and slandering others as crimes. Therefore, "freedom of speech" is not absolute and unconditional.**

**Some people in the Herald are not unaware of these basic common sense, but they have other intentions. In mid-April this year, when the student movement broke out, the Herald invited some people to discuss amending the constitution, and someone proposed to delete the sentence "with Comrade Mao Zedong as the leader" in the constitution. Someone also wrote an article proposing that "citizens representing different interest groups and different ideological views lobby parliamentarians outside the parliament to influence the government with their own propositions." The purpose of the Herald's advocacy for "freedom of speech" is not clear?**

**Propagating the "Rectification and Austerity Retreat Theory" to Pressure the Party and the Government**

**In recent years, China's economy has shown signs of overheating. The Party and the government, in light of the situation, have proposed the task of rectification and austerity. This has touched the nerves of those who want to transform China with a bourgeois face and insist on the position of bourgeois liberalization, and they have stirred up a cold wind against rectification and austerity. The Herald is their platform for public opinion. They first separate reform and opening up from rectification and austerity, opposing them, and believe that rectification and austerity hinder reform. An article wrote: "The negative effects of tightening on the national economy have exceeded the limit that the national economy can bear." It is implied that rectification and austerity will not be successful.**

**A letter in the Herald wrote: "We often need to correct operational mistakes at the moment when we negate the target direction together." Another report said: "The current situation prompts more people to think: Is it to put all the accounts on the reform, and through the method of rectification and austerity to make it die a natural death?" "The rectification and austerity strengthen the role of the old system and will bring many negative effects that hinder the further deepening of the reform." Some stubborn individuals who insist on the position of bourgeois liberalization equate rectification and austerity with "stagnation," and "the loss of stagnation is more serious than failure." They shout: Rectification and austerity have the danger of making the achievements of ten years of reform go to waste. Such scare tactics and bullying are intended to put pressure on the Party and the government. In fact, rectification and austerity have not changed the direction of reform, but aim to overcome economic overheating, strive to use 3 years or more time to fundamentally ease the contradiction between social total demand exceeding total supply, suppress the expansion of consumption demand, ease the contradiction of unfair social distribution, control and gradually eliminate inflation, and make the national economy develop as steadily, stably, and coordinately as possible. Rectification and austerity not only create conditions for deepening reform and ensuring the healthy development of reform but also need the cooperation of reform. Separating rectification and austerity from reform and opposing them is groundless and completely wrong.**

**In fact, the so-called "reform" advocated by those who stubbornly insist on the position of bourgeois liberalization is completely different from our insistence on reform with the four cardinal principles. When China's economic rectification and austerity are steadily advancing and achieving initial results, they finally reveal their knives and shout: "We (again) cannot hesitate to move forward, retreat is more tragic than failure." The Herald published Yan Jiaqi and Wen Yuanke's "Dialogue on the Situation" and Wen Yuanke and others' "Initial Thoughts on China's Reform in the Next Ten Years," throwing out a systematic program of multi-party political system and privatized economy of the bourgeois republic, making theoretical preparations for this turmoil. This "89 Charter," which was enthusiastically praised by the "elites" of the turmoil as the "89 Charter," proudly presented itself as a gesture to rectify the situation, revealing a reform view that is completely opposite to ours, using a capitalist approach to transform China. It claims that "the crises facing and latent in Chinese society have structural, universal, and overall characteristics. The will and direct interests of any individual, party, class, and group cannot, and have no right to, replace the choice and participation of hundreds of millions of people." "Any excuse for the special national conditions or the distortion of modernization will inevitably be punished by history. Using the modern civilization criteria recognized by the world to examine and regulate China's reform ideas and measures is the only way to overcome the historical and regional limitations of China, and truly steadily and sustainably walk on the path of modernization." Those with discerning eyes can easily see the hidden subtext behind these words: First, the so-called structural, universal, and overall crises mean that the entire social system is no longer viable; second, "any party" refers to the Communist Party of China and other democratic parties "cannot" and "have no right" to represent the people; third, "any excuse for special national conditions" is aimed at our construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics; fourth, the so-called "distortion of modernization" is precisely the socialist modernization that we insist on; fifth, the so-called "modern civilization criteria recognized by the world" is a replica and extension of Fang Lizhi's "complete Westernization."**

**When China's economic situation faces temporary difficulties, the Herald does not propagate how to unite and overcome difficulties, but takes the opportunity to use foreign words to slander the socialist system. For example, it says: "The problem of the socialist construction road has not been solved in the world," "it is time to re-recognize history and open up a new path for socialism, otherwise it will fall into a deeper crisis." It praises capitalism for being "too fat to worry" and socialism for being "too thin to suffer." The Herald praises capitalism so much and ridicules socialism so much. This strong tendency is the direction of the Herald.**

**The Herald was founded in 1980. At the beginning of its establishment, it propagated reform and opening up according to the purpose of running the newspaper, published some good articles and reports, and provided some beneficial opinions for the Party and the government, thus gaining good evaluations in society. Unfortunately, good times do not last. Under the influence of the international climate and domestic climate, the leaders of the newspaper developed from resonance to accommodation, from accommodation to advocacy, and finally fell deeper and deeper. When the bourgeois liberalization tendency of the Herald became more and more obvious, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China had repeatedly conducted serious criticism and assistance, but the leaders of the newspaper did not listen and only made superficial apologies while not being convinced in their hearts. People know that the Herald was favored and protected by Comrade Zhao Ziyang. When the key moment of rectifying the Herald in 1987 came, Comrade Zhao Ziyang's secretary went to visit, and the leaders of the Herald understood and were fearless. They not only did not return to the right path in the process of liberalization but also became more and more rampant. They gradually turned the newspaper's pages into a forum for advocating liberalization. It leads to political pluralism, cultural Westernization, and economic privatization in politics, culture, and economy. The "peaceful evolution" process of the Herald is a typical event worth serious reflection. From this, we can draw lessons, which not only has practical significance for the news industry but also has some enlightenment for other superstructure departments.**

    《导报》导向何方？
    冯兆
    ●《世界经济导报》在宣扬资产阶级自由化方面由来已久。
    ●《导报》在经济上竭力鼓吹私有化。它借介绍西方国家“私有化浪潮”和“亚洲四小龙的成功”，美化私有制，贬低和否定公有制，并引用所谓“精英”提出的中国出路在于私有制的见解，为私有化提供理论依据。
    ●鼓吹政治上的多元化，是《导报》的又一个重要导向。一个时期来，该报上发表排斥党的领导的言论连篇累牍，并打着“言论自由”的旗号，企图摆脱党的领导。
    ●党和政府提出治理整顿任务以后，一些坚持资产阶级自由化的人物，利用《导报》的阵地刮起一股反对治理整顿的冷风，他们将改革开放与治理整顿割裂开来，对立起来，胡说治理整顿妨碍改革，亮出了他们用资本主义一套来改造中国的“改革”观。
    在今年春夏之交发生的政治风波中，《世界经济导报》兴风作浪，成为从舆论入手制造动乱的一个策源地。人们不禁要问：《世界经济导报》怎么会在这次动乱中陷得那么深？冰冻三尺，非一日之寒。《导报》导向何方？只要翻阅一下近年来《导报》发表的一系列文章和访问记、对话录，以及《导报》领导人介绍经验的一些记载，不难发现《导报》在宣扬资产阶级自由化方面由来已久，不遗余力。
    鼓吹经济私有化意欲改变社会主义性质
    《导报》在经济上竭力鼓吹私有化。翻阅它的版面，赫然在目的标题是《国有制在世界范围走到了尽头》、《私有化浪潮席卷全球》、《国有制往何处去？》、《国有财产个人化：中国经济改革的趋势与选择》等等。从这些标题我们可以看出它明显的倾向性。
    《导报》为私有制大造舆论，采用了由远及近的手法。它的报道中称：“私有化浪潮自80年开始，如今席卷全球”。“英国是全球私有化的先锋”，“日本私有化金额居首位”，法国、意大利、西班牙纷纷拍卖国有公司财产和出售公司股票。这种宣传力图要人们相信：国有公司没有出路，私营化是当今世界之潮流。
    《导报》又借外国人之口，说“亚洲四小龙”成功的最重要因素，是“向居民提供相当大的个人经济自由，严格实行私有产权制度”。“社会主义最大的问题不知道社会主义是什么，不知道如何给社会主义下定义，公有制优越性不清楚。”两相对比，《导报》的导向也就再清楚不过了。不过，这里掩盖了一个基本事实，即资本主义国家是资产阶级共同管理委员会罢了，它的“国有”转私营，是垄断资本的一种形式向另一种形式的转换而已。
    我国是社会主义国家，公有制经济占主体地位，是社会主义经济制度的最基本特征。根据我国社会主义初级阶段的国情，私营经济对于发展社会生产、方便人民生活、扩大劳动就业，具有重要的不可或缺的补充作用，因而应鼓励它们在国家允许范围内积极发展。但也要估计到私营经济的盲目性和自私性的一面，应限制它不利于社会主义经济发展的消极作用。而《导报》发表的文章则认为“私人经济在当前极其重要的历史作用，可以概括为动力、活力、主力、利己、利国、利民。”随即提出对私人经济应“不受发展比例、范围和规模的限制”。把私有制吹嘘得天花乱坠，似乎是天仙美女，救世良方。
    江泽民同志指出：“非公有制经济在我国国民经济中所占比重和发展领域，要根据我国现实生产力水平和客观需要来确定，不能简单地把它所占比重的大小作为衡量改革成绩的标志。”在一些人看来，似乎私营经济不受限制地大发展，才是改革的巨大进展，这是片面的和极端错误的看法。又有一些人在《导报》上提出：“如果说包产到户是农村第一步改革，那么发展私人经济则应作为中国当务之急的第二步改革”。“在中国广大农村，私人经济应成为生产力发展的主力军”。实际上要公有制经济让出广大农村这一地盘，由私营经济来主宰一切。如果真是那样的话，粮食和经济作物的计划安排将全被冲破，国家所必需的原料得不到有效保证，粮食、棉花、油料、水产、蚕丝、药材、茶叶、烟叶等等重要物资一旦控制在私人手里，将出现哄抬物价、奇货可居和对农产品大肆杀价的局面，国家利益和农民利益都将受到严重损害。农村和城市密不可分，私营经济一旦在农村占支配地位，城市公有经济也势必受其掣肘。那就必将从根本上动摇公有制的主体地位了。
    不仅如此，《导报》还发表公然鼓吹压根儿地主张实行私营化的文章。他们宣称：“试了各种方案，就是不敢试被全世界上百个国家数千年历史所证明最有效最简单的一个方案——私有制。”还有一个所谓“国有制危机理论研讨会”，居然提出“国有制已到了最后被否认阶段”。“今后的出路是民营化、私营化”。对上述公然否定社会主义经济制度的主张，《导报》竟称之谓“真知灼见”，“令人耳目一新”。
    《导报》又借外国学者之口，推崇私有制。比如有一个外国学者建议，把政府掌握的财产，变成各级政府、基金会、社团和个人的资本，他们之间可以自由转让。换句话说，即把国家的财产化为地方和小团体及其个人所有，这是瓦解公有制之策，《导报》辟出版面，予以介绍兜售。
    显然，美化私有制，旨在否定公有制。严家其就在《导报》撰文提出：“目前最大的问题是改革所有制，要积极发展私有制。腐败与公有制有关。”《导报》记者张伟国也对公有制大加非议，他认为“公有制腐蚀了整个民族、整个社会、整个干部队伍”。把公有制简直描绘成一种祸害。按严家其等人的逻辑，公有制都得改变为私有制，中国才有出路才有前途，那不是要倒退到旧中国去了吗？
    建国以来，我国社会主义建设蓬勃发展，取得了举世瞩目的巨大成就，公有制经济显示了它的生机活力。当然，我们的工作也有失误，但毛病不出在公有制本身，而是具体管理制度上（包括宏观的与微观的运行机制）还存在一些弊端，妨碍着社会主义公有制优越性的进一步发挥。当今的条件下，除了探索社会主义条件下私人经济、个体经济如何健康发展以外，重要的是要研究怎么使公有制经济充满生机活力，尤其是探索如何进一步发挥全民所有制企业的活力问题，怎样调整产业结构，怎样完善企业管理，怎样能够真正体现按劳分配的社会主义原则，克服收入分配不公，怎样调动全体职工的生产积极性，发挥主动性和创造性等等，正是在这个意义上，我们要进行改革。而我们的改革的目的是为了完善公有制，而决不是要去削弱或否定公有制。
    近年来社会上出现了极其令人厌恶的腐败现象，一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人物以为这抓到了可以用来中伤公有制的把柄，一时公有制产生腐败的论调泛起。然而，建国几十年来，先前较长时期中，并没有出现“官倒”等腐败现象，可见公有制与腐败并无必然联系。近年来出现腐败现象，有复杂的原因，其中重要原因之一正是由于资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，“一切向钱看”的歪道被视为正经，利己主义盛行，一些人以权谋私，把权力转化财富。我们批判资产阶级自由化，摒弃一切为了个人的拜金主义，乃是防止腐败的重要途径。严家其、张伟国责难公有制出腐败，隐匿资产阶级自由化思潮是造成腐败的思想根源，可谓因果颠倒。
    《导报》在鼓吹私营化的同时，呼唤中国应有一个“中产阶级”，据云它“活跃在微观层次，无须任何强加，在他追求自身利益的时候，本身就代表了长远利益”。有人构想“实现国有财产个人化，……把本来属于人民的财产从国家占有的形式转变为个人直接占有形式。”实际上，所谓“中产阶级”的理论是西方对社会阶层的一种说法，是模糊阶级关系的一种理论。将这种理论搬到中国来，无非是为了替换马克思主义的阶级分析法，否定工人阶级和工农联盟，为他们的私有化提供阶级基础的理论依据，其后果，只能是召唤一批化公为私的能手，用巧取豪夺的办法吞噬国家公有财产，成为新的资产阶级。亦即企图用劳动人民的血汗去重新培植和养肥一个资产阶级，妄图让中国各族人民再度沦为外国资本和本国剥削阶级的双重奴隶。由此看来，《导报》某些负责人所一再标榜的“坚持改革”，实质上是坚持那种背离社会主义方向的“改革”。
    鼓吹政治多元化旨在摆脱党的领导
    政治上的“多元化”，是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人排斥和取消中国共产党的领导、企图在中国建立反对党的代名词，他们不便明说，便用“多元”这个词作遮掩。《导报》借报道国外消息，注入自己的灵魂，诸如《多元的政治：改革成功的道路》、《多党制思想给……社会带来新的活力》、《社会主义要保护反对派的地位》，用标题作文章，可谓典型的借题发挥，人称春秋笔法。“借他人之酒杯，消胸中之垒块”。
    一个时期来，在《导报》上发表排斥党的领导的言论连篇累牍，如提出“政治体制改革以权力多元化为原则”；“改革之成功与否的基本标志在于是否出现了某种制衡的格局和多元的政治”。“经济多元化，是政治多元化的基础，是现代政党的基础”。弦外之音是，既然存在私有经济也就有代表他们利益的政治派别甚至政党，为建立反对党制造舆论。
    发表在《导报》上的温元凯等人的《未来十年中国改革的初步设想》中居心险恶地提出：“党理党务，党筹党费，党正党风、党容党派”。这就是说，中国共产党自己去管管党务、收收党费、整整自己的党风吧，你要容纳别的党派呀！这里，根本抹去了中国共产党的执政党的领导地位。“党容党派”，这话似乎令人费解，中国不是存在各民主党派吗？“党容党派”岂非无的放矢？显然，温元凯意在言外，即要允许反对党的存在。
    《导报》有文章说“政党只是国家范围的一个社团而已，且被国家概念所涵盖，它只是大圈内的一个圈子”。制造这种舆论，意欲把长期来中国革命实践中所确立的中国共产党的领导地位，降低到只是一个普普通通的社会团体，而且不许对其他社团进行领导。有的文章就提出：“要改变党和社会团体之间简单的领导和被领导关系，使各种社会团体真正成为相对独立的政治力量”。换句话说，要排斥党对工会、共青团等等的领导作用。让一个个社会团体“独立”出来，向党闹独立性，实际上妄图使之演变为反对党。尽人皆知，国际上哪一个执政党不是对国家的大计方针的兴革起重要作用，执政党决不是一般的社团。在我国，中国共产党的领导地位是历史上形成的，在推动历史前进中的功绩、系统而深刻的理论基础以及积累的经验为其他政治力量所不可比拟的，所以亿万人民发出“没有共产党就没有新中国”的心声，反映了人民对我们党的信赖。党也曾有过这样那样的失误，这不仅为创建人类崭新的社会的探索中难以避免，并且党总是主要靠自身的力量起来纠正了错误，拨正了航向。如党的十一届三中全会，拨乱反正，正本清源，给我们社会主义祖国带来了蓬勃的生机和活力，改革开放十年来的成就是有目共睹的。然而顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的《导报》领导人，对党别具二心，竭力为摆脱党的领导而制造舆论，该报总编辑钦本立对境外报纸发表谈话时就提出“淡化党的领导”，“必须改变党领导一切”的主张。在《导报》上还出现这样的论调：“必须允许政治反对派的存在并且发言”。钦本立的错误言论受到批评时，他仍固执己见地说：“对党不能领导一切，我仍这样看。党难道能领导太阳吗？”激愤之情昭然可见。一个入党多年的老党员，一个多年担任报纸总编辑的老报人，何以若此？除了说明他实在按捺不住久蓄心头力图摆脱党的领导的急切心情和肆意对党进行嘲讽外，还能说明什么呢？
    打着“言论自由”的旗号，企图摆脱党的领导是《导报》的重要一招。据称“言论同思维一样，其自由是无条件的。”“什么叫言论自由？肯定方面就是人想说什么就说什么，否定方面就是人说什么不能听命于他人，即人不应该因言获罪”。“当人们郑重其事地为言论自由定规矩划框框时不知是否意识到，这已经违背宪法了”。这个“自由”真是天方夜谭，是世界上从来也没有过的，连标榜“自由世界”的资本主义国家也是否定的，资产阶级的法律规定，自由是以不损害他人利益为前提。孟德斯鸠说得很清楚，“自由是做法律所许可的一切事情的权利。”在我国，“言论自由”是在整部宪法总纲前提下的自由，要符合四项基本原则，要有利于社会主义现代化建设，离开这总的前提就不符合宪法；不是想说什么就说什么。进行反革命煽动，造谣、诽谤，何尝不是“言论”？法律明确规定对上述行径要治罪，世界各国的许多法律条文都对旨在颠覆国家和诽谤他人的言论列为罪行。所以“言论自由”决不是绝对的和无条件的。
    《导报》的某些人并非不知道这些起码的常识，而是另有所图。今年4月中旬，学潮爆发之际，《导报》邀集一些人研讨修改宪法，有人就提议宪法中要删掉“以毛泽东主席为领袖”的语句。有人还撰文提出“代表不同利益阶层和不同思想观点的公民，在议会外对议员进行游说，以自己的主张去影响政府”。《导报》鼓吹“言论自由”目的何在，不是一目了然了吗？
    宣扬“整顿倒退论”，对党和政府施加压力
    近年来，我国经济出现了过热现象，党和政府审时度势，提出了治理整顿的任务。这一下触痛了想用资产阶级面貌来改造我国、坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人物的神经，他们刮起了一股反对治理整顿的冷风。《导报》正是他们的一个舆论阵地。他们首先把改革开放与治理整顿割裂开来，对立起来，认为治理整顿妨碍改革。有的文章写道：“紧缩对国民经济起的副作用，超出了国民经济可以承受的限度。”讽喻治理整顿也不可能成功。
    《导报》的一篇书简中写道：“我们往往需要纠正操作失误的时刻，连同目标方向一起否定了”。另一则报道中称：“现状促使更多人在深思：是把各种帐都算到改革份上，通过治理整顿办法使其寿终正寝”。“整治正强化旧体制的作用，将带来很多妨碍进一步深化改革的负效应。”一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人物把治理整顿与“停滞”划等号，而“停滞的损失比失败更严重”。他们叫嚷：整顿有使十年改革成果付诸东流的危险。如此等等，这既是危言耸听，也咄咄逼人，意在向党和政府施加压力。事实上，治理整顿根本没有改变改革方向，而是旨在克服经济过热，力争用3年或者更多一些时间，从根本上缓解社会总需求超过总供给，抑制消费需求膨胀，缓解社会分配不公的矛盾，控制以致逐步消除通货膨胀，使国民经济尽可能得到持续、稳定、协调的发展。治理整顿不仅为深化改革和保证改革健康发展创造条件，而且它本身也需要改革的配合。把治理整顿同改革割裂开来、对立起来是毫无根据的，也是完全错误的。
    其实，那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人物所说的“改革”，和我们主张坚持四项基本原则的改革是截然不同的。当中国经济的治理整顿正在稳步前进并取得初步成效时，他们终于图穷而匕首见，情急意乱地叫喊：“我们（再）也不能犹豫不前，退却比失败更可悲”。《导报》发表严家其与温元凯《关于时局的对话》和温元凯等人《未来十年中国改革的初步设想》，抛出了系统的多党制政治、私有化经济的资产阶级共和国的纲领，为这次动乱作了理论上的准备。这个受到动乱“精英”狂热吹捧为“89宪章”的《未来十年中国改革的初步设想》俨然以收拾时局的姿态，亮出了与我们截然相反的用资本主义一套来改造中国羚会的改革观，它宣称“我国社会面临和潜在的危机，已具结构性、普遍性和总体性。任何个人、政党、阶层和集团的意志和直接的利益需求，都不能、也无权取代亿万人民的选择、参与”。“一切借口国情特殊、或排斥曲解现代化的作法，都必将受到历史的惩罚。以世界公认的现代文明准则来审查和规范我国改革的思路和举措，是克服我国历史、地域局限性，真正稳步、持久走在现代历程的唯一正道”。明眼人不难看出这些话后面隐含的一大堆潜台词：一、所谓结构性、普遍性、总体性危机，即是说整个社会制度不行了；二、“任何政党”，意指中国共产党及各民主党派“不能”“也无权”代表人民；三、“一切借口国情特殊”，针对我们建设有中国特色的社会主义；四、所谓“曲解现代化”正是我们坚持的社会主义现代化；五、所谓“世界公认的现代文明准则”则是方励之的“全盘西化”的翻版和延伸。
    在我国经济状况面临暂时困难时，《导报》不是去宣传如何同心同德克服困难，还借机用外国人的话来诋毁社会主义制度。如说：“社会主义建设道路问题全世界没有解决”，“现在已到重新认识历史和为社会主义另辟蹊径的时候，不然将陷入更加深重的危机”。称资本主义“为过于肥胖而发愁”，而社会主义为“过于消瘦而痛苦”。《导报》对资本主义如此溢美，对社会主义则肆意挖苦。这种强烈的倾向，正是《导报》的导向。
    《导报》创办于1980年，创办之初曾按照办报宗旨宣传改革开放，发表过一些好的文章和报道，为党和政府提供过一些有益的见解，因而在社会上获得好评。可惜好景不常，该报领导人在国际大气候和国内小气候的影响下，对资产阶级自由化思潮由共鸣而发展到迎合，由迎合而至倡导，以致越陷越深。当《导报》的资产阶级自由化倾向日益明显时，中共上海市委曾一再进行严肃的批评帮助，该报领导人听不进去，表面敷衍其事地作检讨，内心又不服。人们知道，《导报》受到赵紫阳同志的青睐和庇护，当1987年整顿《导报》的关键时刻，赵紫阳同志的秘书前往慰问，该报领导人心领神会，有恃无恐，在自由化的途中不但不迷途知返，而且变本加厉。将报纸的版面逐步演变成鼓吹自由化的论坛。它在政治上导向多元化，文化上导向西方化，经济上导向私有化。《导报》的“和平演变”过程，是一个值得认真思索的典型事件。从中总结教训，这不但对新闻界有现实意义，而且对其他上层建筑部门也不无教益。
