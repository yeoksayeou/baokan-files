In the hills and ravines at the foot of Longshan Mountain south of the city of Penglai County, Shandong Province, there is a small, unassuming village. In this village, there is an elderly man with a weathered face, graying temples, and wearing cloth shoes—a man named Wang Yanying, who is a notable inventor in China's plastics industry and the director of the Penglai County Micro-Porous Plastics Research Institute.

How did this former farmer, who once tilled the soil, enter the realm of scientific invention? This puzzling event needs to be explained from the beginning.

Wang Yanying was originally the party branch secretary of Chuanwang Village. He is stubborn, straightforward, and tenacious, not good at socializing, and always deep in thought. He has a knack for delving into the root of any problem. In the spring of 1974, by chance, he saw a factory in Beijing using metal powder to make car filters. At that time, he thought, "If metal powder can be used to make filters, why can't plastic powder?" He never imagined that this technique was a blank in China and was advanced even on a global scale.

For a long time, the filtration systems for locomotives, automobiles, tractors, machine tools, and general machinery in China have used ceramic filter cores, copper powder metallurgy, and copper mesh filter cores from the 1930s, which have obvious defects and urgently need to be replaced with new filtration materials.

Wang Yanying only had a primary school education and couldn't even write molecular formulas, but he firmly believed that there is nothing in the world that cannot be learned. He and a fellow villager, Wang Wenhua, found a polymer textbook and copied it down in a few days. They began to read it page by page, word by word, until the cover was faded and the text was blurred. Following the textbook knowledge, they finally managed to produce a few plastic filter cores.

Then, he eagerly went to Beijing, where experts guided him through repeated experiments, finally developing a prototype of the micro-porous plastic filter. It was immediately recommended by the Ministry of Mechanical Industry to the Second Automobile Works and the Beijing Jeep Factory for trials. After the Dongfeng heavy-duty truck underwent filtration tests over tens of thousands of kilometers on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the filters produced by Wang Yanying's team never showed signs of vaporizer blockage or oil starvation, demonstrating excellent filtration performance. This hard micro-porous plastic filter can meet the filtration requirements of various automobiles, tractors, and machine tools.

In an astonishing turn of events, the key equipment for China's automobile industry—the filter—was developed by two farmers.

The successful development of the micro-porous plastic filter for automobiles made an engineer from the Luoyang Tractor Research Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical Industry excitedly predict: "Old Wang's research in micro-porous plastics will bring a revolution to China's filtration materials."

Soon, the famous water conservancy project, the Gezhouba Dam, was preparing to install a type of ultra-high voltage, large-scale transformer. Two professors from Tsinghua University and Xi'an Jiaotong University determined that the plastic filter core developed by Wang Yanying had a significantly higher rigidity than the filter core imported from abroad for the transformer oil filter. Thus, the hard micro-porous plastic filter core developed by Wang Yanying was installed on the four 600,000-volt ultra-high voltage transformers of the Gezhouba water conservancy hub and has been in use ever since.

Next, Wang Yanying developed a hard micro-porous plastic sound-absorbing board, which was used to equip a large electronic computer at Tsinghua University with a sound-absorbing device. The high-frequency sound absorption rate reached 99.7%, and it was praised by the school's noise physics experts as a world-class sound-absorbing material.

He also solved the key component problem for the Beijing Washing Machine Factory—the spray tube. The spray tubes he developed and produced cost only 1/10th of the imported price, and some technical indicators even surpassed the imported standards. In 1987, this achievement won the first-class science and technology progress award of Shandong Province.

It is hard to imagine that a farmer-turned-engineer could achieve such remarkable results, but who knows how much sweat he has poured into this over the past decade? Wang Yanying has an extraordinary intuition for science, which cannot be explained by ordinary logic. Over the years, he and his longtime partner, Wang Wenhua, have accumulated a wealth of experience. Many formulas and experimental data are almost memorized.

He is 56 years old, and due to years of hard work, his health has been very weak at times. However, even under the pillow while receiving intravenous drips in the hospital, there are still his carefully designed drawings. He still wants to apply micro-porous plastics to aircraft lubrication oil filtration, urban sewage treatment, aerospace, radar, and other broad fields. He also has a long-held wish to develop and open up the field of soft micro-porous plastic engineering during his lifetime.

This elderly farmer, known as one of the "New Eight Immortals of Penglai," still dresses like a farmer and smokes "rolled cigarettes."

As a Japanese expert once said, "Penglai is a place where gods are born, and any miracle can happen here." In the inventor Wang Yanying, who was born with muddy legs, isn't the wisdom and intelligence of Chinese farmers embodied?

    农民发明家王衍嬴
    杨皓
    在山东省蓬莱县城南龙山脚下的丘陵沟壑之间，有一座很不起眼的偏僻山村。村子里有一位脸膛黝黑两鬓斑白脚穿布鞋的憔悴老人，他就是我国塑料行业引人注目的发明家、蓬莱县微孔塑料研究所所长王衍嬴。
    这位昔日与土坷垃打交道的农民，是怎样闯入科技发明的殿堂的？这件令人大惑不解的事，还得从头说起。
    王衍嬴原是川王村的党支部书记。他脾气倔犟，朴实、刚毅，不善交际，耽于沉思，对什么事情都有一种追根究底的钻劲。1974年初春，一个偶然的机会，他在北京的一家工厂里看到用金属粉末制造汽车滤清器。当时，他就想，既然金属粉末能做滤清器，那塑料粉末为什么就不能呢？他做梦也没有想到，这种工艺在我国尚属空白，在世界上也具有先进水平。
    我国的机车、汽车、拖拉机、机床和通用机械的滤清，长期以来沿用30年代的陶瓷滤芯、铜质粉末冶金和铜网滤芯，存在明显缺陷，亟待用新的滤清材料来代替上述产品。
    王衍嬴只有初小文化程度，连分子式都不会写，但他坚信世上没有学不到手的东西。他和同村的王文化找来一本高分子教材，用了几天时间，照葫芦画瓢抄了下来。他们开始一页一页地通读，一个字一个字咀嚼，直翻得封页都斑驳不清，字迹一片模糊。按照书本知识，他俩终于烧出了几个塑料滤芯。
    于是，他又兴冲冲地赶到北京，在有关专家指点下，经过反复实验，终于研制出了微孔塑料滤清器的定型样品，立即被机械工业部推荐到二汽和北京吉普车厂试用。经过东风载重车推荐在青藏高原上数万公里的滤油试验，他们所生产的滤清器从未出现过汽化器阻塞、不来油等现象，滤清性能相当好。这种硬质微孔塑料滤清器能满足各种汽车、拖拉机、机床的过滤要求。
    我国汽车行业的关键设备——滤清器的换代产品，就这样不可思议地在两位农民手中诞生了。
    汽车微孔塑料滤清器的研制成功，使机械工业部洛阳拖拉机研究所的一位工程师激动地预言：“老王在微孔塑料方面的研究，将给我国过滤材质带来一场革命。”
    不久，我国举世闻名的水利工程葛洲坝上准备安装一种超高压特大型变压器，经清华大学和西安交大的两位教授测定，王衍嬴所研制的塑料滤芯在刚性强度上明显优于从国外进口的变压器滤油器上的滤芯。于是，他所研制的这种硬质微孔塑料滤芯被安装在葛洲坝水利枢纽的4台60万伏超高压变压器上，一直使用至今。
    接着，王衍嬴又研制出硬质微孔塑料吸音板，为清华大学引进大型电子计算机装配了吸音装置，高频吸音率达到99.7％，被该校噪音物理专家誉为世界第一流的吸音材料。
    他还为北京洗衣机总厂解决了洗衣机的关键部件——喷淋管的研制难题。他所研制并生产的喷淋管，成本只有进口价格的1／10，而某些技术指标甚至超过国外进口的水平。1987年，这项成果荣获山东省科技进步一等奖。
    人们很难想象，一位农民出身的工程师居然取得如此显赫的成果，可是，又有谁知道，10多年来，他曾为此而付出过多少汗水？王衍嬴对科学有一种了不起的悟性，这种悟性是不能用一般的思维逻辑去解答的。多年来，他和他的老搭档王文化一道积累了丰富的经验，许多配方和实验数据，几乎可以闭目成诵。
    他56岁了，由于长年的劳累，身体一度极其虚弱，然而，就在医院输液的枕头底下还压着他精心设计的图纸。他还想把微孔塑料应用到飞机润滑油过滤、城市污水处理、航天、雷达等广阔的领域，他还有一个埋在心底的夙愿，这就是在他的有生之年，研制并开发软质微孔塑料工程。
    这位被誉为蓬莱“新八仙”的老农民，依然是一副农民的装束，抽烟依旧是“卷大炮”。
    正像一位日本专家所说的：“蓬莱是出神仙的地方，什么样的奇迹都有可能在这里发生。”在泥腿子出身的发明家王衍嬴身上，不正体现了中国农民的聪明、智慧么！
