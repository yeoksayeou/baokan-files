The tenth second plenary session of the China Democratic League, which has 44,107 members, opened here today. Lu Jiaxi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said in his work report that the China Democratic League should carry forward the fine tradition of long-term cooperation and sharing weal and woe with the Communist Party of China. No matter what storms and twists and turns we encounter on the road ahead, we must stand firm and clearly accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and adhere to the socialist road.

Zhou Gucheng sent a congratulatory message from Shanghai: For the country to be stable and united, and for the people to live and work in peace, I call on all comrades of the China Democratic League to work hard and be serious, and not just talk.

Lu Jiaxi, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, said in his work report that the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party is a characteristic and advantage of China's political system. In China, we must not adopt the Western-style multi-party system.

When talking about the key tasks for the China Democratic League next year, Lu Jiaxi said: First, we must seriously study the speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin on National Day and the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and contribute wisdom and strength to further rectification and deepening of reform; second, we must unite as one, with one heart and one mind, and resolutely safeguard the political situation of stability and unity; third, we must adhere to, improve and develop the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and better play the role of the party in participating in the political life of the state and exercising democratic supervision; fourth, we must continue to give full play to our advantages and carry out work facing society; fifth, we must strengthen overseas liaison work; sixth, we must strengthen our own construction.

    旗帜鲜明地接受共产党领导
    本报北京12月13日讯　记者袁建达报道：拥有44107名党员的中国农工民主党十届二中全会今天在这里开幕。全国政协副主席、农工党中央主席卢嘉锡在工作报告中说，农工民主党要发扬与中共长期合作、风雨同舟的优良传统，在前进的道路上不论遇到什么风波和曲折，都要立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地接受中共的领导，坚持中国共产党领导的多党合作制，坚持走社会主义道路。
    周谷城从上海发来贺辞说：国家要安定团结，人民要安居乐业，请号召农工民主党全体同志努力工作，人人认真，不要空说。
    卢嘉锡代表中央常委会作的工作报告认为，共产党领导的多党合作制度是我国政治制度中的一个特点和优点。在我国决不能搞西方式的多党制。
