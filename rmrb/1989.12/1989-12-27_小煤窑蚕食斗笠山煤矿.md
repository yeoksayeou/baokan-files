Small Coal Mines Eroding the Safety of the Doulimountain Coal Mine

In recent years, our mine has been surrounded by nearly a hundred small coal mines illegally operated by farmers from the towns of Ganxi, Fengping, Qingyan, Yangjiatan, and Doulimountain in Lianyuan City. They have violated the Mineral Resources Law, forcibly entering our mine's operational area and recklessly mining safety coal pillars beneath workers' dormitories, schools, railways, roads, bridges, and flood control facilities. This has caused severe disruption to our mine's ventilation system, creating major hazards of spontaneous combustion and gas explosions, seriously endangering the safety of our mine workers and the mine area. According to statistics, these illegal small coal mines have caused our mine to suffer economic losses amounting to over 100 million yuan.

Over the past few years, our mine has repeatedly reported the issue of illegal mining by small coal mines to relevant departments. The Lianyuan City Government has ordered the closure of some small coal mines that seriously affect our mine's safe production. However, some mine owners have ignored the city government's closure orders and continued to illegally mine our safety coal pillars. To ensure the survival and development of our mine, we appeal to relevant departments to take measures to close these small coal mines that harm the state and the people.

    小煤窑蚕食斗笠山煤矿
      近年来，我矿已经被涟源市甘溪、枫坪、青烟、杨家滩、斗笠山等乡镇农民非法开采的近百家小煤窑团团包围。他们违反矿产资源法，强行进入我矿作业区，在职工宿舍、学校、铁路、公路、桥梁、防水防洪设施下面乱采滥挖保安煤柱，造成我矿矿井通风严重紊乱，埋下自然发火和瓦斯爆炸的重大隐患，严重危及我矿工人和矿区的安全。据统计，这些非法开采的小煤窑已给我矿造成上亿元的经济损失。
    几年来，我矿数十次向有关部门反映小煤窑乱采滥挖的问题，涟源市政府曾下令封闭一些严重影响我矿安全生产的小煤窑，但有的窑主无视市政府的封闭令，继续乱采我矿的保安煤柱。为确保我矿的生存发展，呼吁有关部门采取措施，封闭这些贻害国家和人民的小煤窑。
