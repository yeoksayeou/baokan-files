In the past, in my hometown of Lijiang, Yunnan, men who drove horse teams across the country were considered real men. At that time, there were no roads in the mountains, and everything from clothing to daily necessities had to be transported in by horse. There were many horse drivers back then, but their lives were tough. With more than ten mules, they had to feed, saddle, and load them, starting early and ending late each day.

I had a cousin who was strong and sturdy. At 18, he became the only horse driver in the village. Throughout the year, my cousin was almost always on the road, driving his horse team to transport goods. Whenever he returned home with his horse team, we kids would gather around him to listen to stories about the outside world—things like the sea, electricity, and cars. He told these stories with such wonder and fascination. Later, my friends finished primary school and middle school, one by one they all went out to the world. Some became workers, some became officials, and some went to college. Only my cousin stayed behind, continuing to drive his team of old horses in the mountains. I heard that his family's life was quite difficult.

Over the years, I often thought of him, especially in recent years when the countryside has been changing rapidly. The winds of reform have brought new life to our country, and the world has entered the mountains. I wondered, how is my cousin living now? In March, I had the chance to return to my hometown after many years. On the evening of my arrival, I went straight to my cousin's house. He was overjoyed to see me. Before I could even sit down by the fire, a large plate of fruit was placed in front of me, along with a bowl of fragrant Suolima wine: "Try some, it's newly brewed. These days, we don't have to worry about having wine to drink."

"Is cousin still driving horses?" "No, not anymore. A few years ago, when the household responsibility system was implemented, the village's mules were sold to private owners. I bought two, and usually, I use them to transport things. During the off-season, I ride them to the outside to do some business and make some money." At that moment, I noticed a cassette player on the wall. "I had someone buy this from outside. When I have free time, I listen to some folk songs."

What surprised me even more was that my cousin, who had little education, had learned excellent carpentry skills over the past few years. He had participated in the construction of several government buildings. Now that the mountains have roads connecting to the outside world, there's no need for horse teams anymore. My cousin has made some money and bought a small truck, which has brought a lot of convenience to the villagers.

My hometown is both familiar and strange to me now. As I sat in my cousin's truck, I thought, what will my cousin's fate be when I return next time? What will my hometown look like?

    赶马哥的命运
    殷海涛
    过去在我的故乡云南丽江，赶马帮走南闯北的男人才算是有本事的男子汉。当时山里没有公路，穿的用的都从山外用马驮进来。那时，赶马帮的人很多，但赶马生活很苦，10多匹骡子一出门就得喂养、备鞍、驮卸，起早摸黑。
    我有个表哥，长得身强力壮，18岁就成了村里唯一的赶马人。一年四季，表哥几乎全在外赶马驮运货物。每当他赶着马帮回到家中时，我们这些小伙伴便围着他听那些山外的新鲜事，什么海呀，电灯呀，汽车呀，讲得神奇迷人。后来呢，伙伴们读完了小学、初中，一个个都到山外去了，有的当了工人，有的当了干部，有的上了大学，唯有表哥没有出去，一直在山里赶着那十几匹老马。听说他家的日子过得挺艰难。
    时过多年，在外面的我一直在想念着他，特别是这几年，农村日新月异，改革的春风吹绿了祖国大地，世界已经走进大山。如今，我那位表哥过着怎样的生活呢？阳春三月，我有幸回到了阔别多年的故乡。到家的当晚，我就踏进了表哥家的门。表哥见到我喜出望外。我还没在火塘边坐稳，一大盘食果便摆在我面前，还端来一碗香喷喷的酥理玛酒：“尝尝，新酿的。如今这年景，吃酒不用愁哩。”
      “表哥还在赶马吧？”“早没哩，前几年搞包产到户，村里的骡子都卖给了私人，我买下了两匹，平常时驮点东西，农闲时骑着去山外做点生意，找点钱花。”这时，我才发现堂屋上方摆有一台收录机。“这是托人从外面买来的，没事时听听古哩（民歌）。”原来，表哥录了一盘自己唱的民歌，逢年过节放给乡亲们欣赏，也添几分节日的乐趣。
    更令人惊奇的是，没有文化的表哥这几年靠勤劳的双手和自己的聪明的智慧掌握了一手好木工技术，已先后参加修建了几幢机关大楼。如今山里与外界有公路相通，不需要跑马帮了，表哥有了钱又买了一台小型汽车，给村民带来了许多方便。
    故乡的一切是那样亲切，又是那样陌生。我坐在表哥的汽车上想，我再回来时，表哥的命运会怎样，故乡的面貌又会如何呢？
