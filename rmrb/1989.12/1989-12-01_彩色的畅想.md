A beautifully bound album lay before me, featuring photos taken by Li Ning and others during the 10th Asian Games in Seoul. The photos were vibrant and clear, perfectly capturing the grace of Chinese athletes dominating the Seoul Games.

"Do you know what kind of film was used to take these photos?" a friend asked with a smile.

"Kodak or Fuji, right?" I replied without hesitation.

"No, no, it was China's Lucky."

Could we really produce such high-quality color film? I was skeptical. I remembered reading in a magazine about the global trend in photographic materials: Kodak, the pioneer of the world's photographic materials, had a market presence in every corner of the world. Our neighboring island nation had recently emerged as a formidable competitor, successfully displacing Kodak from the top spot in the Asian market and advancing towards Kodak's traditional markets in Europe and America. The competition in the global photographic materials market was intensifying. Even in the vast Chinese market, it had become a battleground for foreign color films, with yellow and green flags flying high, making it difficult to distinguish between the two... Whenever I thought about this vivid description, my heart was filled with sadness.

But soon, I came to believe that my friend had not been joking with me. It was during a photography exhibition at the Beijing Art Museum, where all the color photos on display were marked with "Lucky." Famous photographers such as Wu Yinxian, Chairman of the Chinese Photographers Association Shi Shaohua, and Vice-Chairmen Chen Changqian, Huang Xiang, and Xu Xiaobing all came to view the exhibition. I saw tears of pride in the eyes of the elderly Wu Yinxian.

Oh, Chinese people, Chinese people. I silently called out in my heart.

Two months later, I had the opportunity to visit the birthplace of "Lucky"—the First Film Factory of the Ministry of Chemical Industry—and witnessed the historical transformation of this modern "film city"...

Who would have thought that in the 1980s, the Chinese photographic materials industry would experience such unforgettable times? If it weren't for the unstoppable wave of color photography sweeping into mainland China; if it weren't for "Kodak" and "Fuji" occupying the shelves of every large and small store in the country, would the Chinese photographic materials industry have been so restless? However, the ancient Eastern country was not without its brave men. They wanted to rise up and reclaim the lost territory. But some people doubted the "self-development theory," calling it a "beautiful mistake" and advocating for spending a large amount of money to import foreign production equipment, believing that only in this way could they catch up with the world's advanced level and change the situation where foreign color photographic materials dominated the Chinese market. In 1983, this view was surprisingly approved by relevant departments. After that, a large amount of foreign exchange was spent to "fully import" from the United States and Japan.

What should "Yi Jiao" do? Should they insist on self-reliance and develop national industries, or should they also ask the central government for a large amount of money to fully import? The sudden rise in color photography and the threat of large-scale imports forced "Yi Jiao" to seek survival in a narrow gap!

Where is the way out for the enterprise?

History once again illuminated the hearts of "Yi Jiao" people:

...The warm sunlight bathed the cornfield, and the autumn sun still scorched the skin. In 1958, the ancient Chinese city of Baoding gathered elite soldiers from the north and south in this cornfield, cutting down the crops and boldly starting a new venture. However, soon, Soviet experts withdrew, and the "natural disaster" arrived, making the film factory "stillborn." The blueprint on paper was realized on the ground with only one factory building. At night, the desolate factory in the wilderness looked like a monster. Under extremely harsh conditions, the "Yi Jiao" people managed to give birth to a "premature" child. Years later, this ruined "factory" grew into a genuine modern "film city." It was here that they independently developed China's first generation of military infrared film; the first generation of black-and-white and color motion picture film; the first generation of aerospace remote sensing film; the first generation of... Here, how many firsts were born, filling in the blanks of China's photographic materials! The "Yi Jiao" people will never forget the scene when they were received by Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People. The premier raised his thick eyebrows and waved his hand, saying, "You must strive for the glory of the Chinese nation and the pride of the Chinese people!"

Reflecting on the history of the development of China's photographic materials, the conclusion can only be this: Insist on self-reliance and hard work, and "Yi Jiao" will have hope! China's photographic materials industry will have hope!

Color photographic materials are high-tech products, and only a few of the most developed countries in the world can produce them. Can we develop them without purchasing foreign technology and relying on our own strength? In the factory's research institute, the director of the color film research room, Shi Zhonghao, recounted the arduous and bumpy road they had traveled over the past few years.

In October 1983, the research institute received an order from the factory director to launch a breakthrough battle. More than 200 days and nights passed, and after thousands of failures, in June 1984, they finally produced the first sample of China's first-generation "Lucky" color film. At that time, it was impossible to describe the excitement and joy of the researchers. However, the emulsion layer of color multilayer film contains dozens of complex and functionally diverse organic compounds. Choosing the optimal formula in one go is not easy. Indeed, feedback from users came back. Users reported that the color film had high water absorption and coarse grains. The second obstacle stood in front of them. The attack was difficult. In September 1984, Minister Qin Zhongda of the Ministry of Chemical Industry led experts from the Second Film Factory and the Shenyang Chemical Research Institute to the factory for on-site consultation, in-depth analysis, and technical cooperation, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses. "Lucky" finally had a new turning point and appeared on the Chinese market with a new look of true color restoration, rich layers, and the ability to adapt to high-temperature fast-processing technology.

The lively sunlight shone through the clear glass window onto the face of Director Shi Zhonghao, whose southern accent was high and moving. After recalling that unforgettable period, he said, "We must fight for the pride of the Chinese people! Seeing 'Kodak' and 'Fuji' occupying the shelves of large and small photo studios in our country, we are heartbroken! We are not convinced by those who say that without importing foreign technology, colorization of film cannot be achieved in China. What is even more unbearable is that in those years, advocating self-reliance was seen as protecting backwardness. They did not know the hearts of Chinese intellectuals! During the development of Lucky color film and paper, my colleagues in the room hardly rested on any holiday. On the first day of the New Year, we went to the workshop for trial production! Everyone had only one belief: to let our Chinese-made color film and color paper shine on the market as soon as possible!"

Yes, all this was for that colorful dream. More than 30 years ago, a group of young people studying in the Soviet Union almost all had this colorful dream. It was one Russian summer night after another, quiet and enchanting. Awake, unable to sleep, they simply picked up their books to review the day's lessons until the rosy dawn quietly climbed the church spire. Later, they all became the backbone of China's photographic materials industry. The leader of the color film research team, Senior Engineer Zhou Jing, was one of them.

Oh, Engineer Zhou, what are you thinking now? When you returned from studying in the Soviet Union, you could have been assigned to work in a state organ, but you heard that we were building our own film factory, so you gave up the city life and came here. You arrived just in time for the three years of "natural disasters," sleeping in damp and dark warehouses, eating a bowl of thin sweet potato porridge, and thus began your persistent pursuit of your career. Later, you had a child, who was born in Shanghai and soon had to leave your little baby to return to Baoding. You missed your child, you are also a mother! Do you remember that year? Like all intellectuals, you were also criticized, wearing the hat of a "special suspect," being searched and paraded, but none of this extinguished your patriotism. With the arrival of that colorful scientific spring, you rushed to accept the task of developing color film, working day and night...

There was also a small incident. Engineer Xu Mingzhong of the color film room, in order to quickly come up with a color paper formula, suffered from appendicitis, pressing his stomach with one hand while continuing to work. Everyone carried him out of the research room, and the doctor told him to go to the hospital for surgery immediately, otherwise, there would be a risk of stomach perforation. He refused to go. There was no choice but to let his wife, who worked in medical care, inject him with penicillin when he stopped working to eat...

This is the spirit of "Yi Jiao" people. This is the style of contemporary Chinese intellectuals!

"Lucky" finally shone brightly under the careful cultivation of "Yi Jiao" people. In 1987, the sales volume reached 8 million rolls, and in Beijing, "Lucky" sales exceeded "Kodak."

The monopoly of "Kodak" and "Fuji" in the Chinese market has been broken, so shouldn't those pessimistic views that do not believe in their own strength be thrown into the Pacific Ocean?

When domestically produced "Lucky" color film occupied nearly 1/3 of the Chinese color photographic materials market, the fully imported equipment that cost billions of dollars from abroad had not yet been put into production. This cannot but make one think deeply.

In the grand scheme of the world economy, it is impossible for the Chinese people to develop themselves by closing the door. China opens its doors to the world, eagerly seeking the "takeoff" momentum. However, in our country, which is still not very rich, how to combine the introduction of technology with our existing scientific and industrial foundation, and how to combine introduction with independent development? This is a question that must be solved. The deputy chief engineer in charge of technology, Xie Yifeng, told me: "Lucky" also needs a good environment for post-natal growth. "Yi Jiao" took a path of introducing some key equipment on the basis of independent development, resulting in only a fraction of the foreign exchange needed for full introduction, and independently designed, installed, and configured auxiliary equipment to build a color film coating production line with world-class standards. It was put into operation on September 13, 1988, and "Lucky" finally had a strong backing to go global.

I was deeply moved by the spirit of struggle of the "Yi Jiao" people. The practice of "Yi Jiao" people shows: Insist on self-reliance and hard work, and national industries have great hope! The key here is to rely on our own wisdom and strength to build a spiritual edifice of self-confidence. The "Yi Jiao" people's understanding of the secrets of the color kingdom and their mastery of the technical know-how of production processes enable them to have unique insights and speaking rights in absorbing and utilizing foreign technology. In the development of their own new product series and the matching of domestic raw materials, they have unique advantages. These advantages are not something that can be bought with a large amount of foreign exchange!

Lucky color film won the National Science and Technology Progress First Prize in 1988. It has begun to be sold to Southeast Asia and Arab countries and has even entered the market of the so-called "film kingdom" of the United States. But the "Yi Jiao" people are not satisfied. Their goal is to climb the highest peak of international photographic materials, which is even more colorful and enchanting. If you are lucky enough to be in this modern "film city" in northern China, you will feel that the aspirations of the "Yi Jiao" people are not empty. Their dream of making Chinese people proud will definitely be realized. The new generation of BR-100 type color film can now stand shoulder to shoulder with those world-famous brands without shame. Lucky color paper quality has reached international standards. In the vocational education center of "Yi Jiao," in the research institute, in the newly built color film coating production line, in the office building, and in the faces of the workers full of confidence, you will feel the power of "Yi Jiao" to turn things around!

This trip to "Yi Jiao" did not allow me to meet Chen Zaoqi, the factory director, and hear the difficulties and burdens felt by this pioneer of China's national photographic materials industry. However, a sentence he once said is deeply engraved in my mind: "Walk our own path and open up a new future for our national photographic materials industry!"

Yes, from the eyes of the "Yi Jiao" people full of conviction and strength, we have already seen the dawn of this future!

    彩色的畅想
    朱建华
    一本装璜精美的影集摆在我面前，是李宁等人在汉城第十届亚运会期间拍摄的。这些照片色彩柔和艳丽，影像清晰，完美地再现了中国体育健儿称雄汉城的风姿。
    “知道用什么胶卷拍摄的吗？”朋友微笑着问我。
    “不是柯达就是富士呗！”我不假思索地回答。
    “错了，错了，是中国的乐凯。”
    我们自己真能制造这样高水平的彩色胶卷？我半信半疑。记得曾在报刊上看到过一段揭示国际感光材料发展大趋势的文字：号称世界感光材料鼻祖的美国柯达公司的传统市场遍布世界的每一个角落，我们的东邻岛国，近年也崛起了堪与“胶片王国”抗衡的力量，它的胶片在亚洲市场成功地把柯达挤下第一把交椅，又在乘胜向欧美柯达传统市场挺进。在世界感光材料的市场上，竞争日趋激烈。偌大中国市场，也成为了外国彩色胶片角逐的沙场，一片黄旗绿旗，杀得难分伯仲……一想起这段绘声绘色的描写，我的心中便油然而生许多悲哀。
    可是没过多久，我终于相信了我的那位朋友并没有戏弄我。那是在北京美术馆举办的一次摄影作品展上，参展的所有彩色照片上都注有“乐凯”的标记，著名摄影家吴印咸、中国摄影家协会主席石少华、副主席陈昌谦、黄翔、徐肖冰都来观展了。我看到吴印咸老人的眼里含着自豪的泪水。
    哦，中国人。中国人。我在心里默默地呼唤。
    两个月之后，我有幸来到“乐凯”的诞生地——化工部第一胶片厂，耳闻目睹了中国这座现代“胶片城”的历史性的变迁……
    谁也不会想到，当历史推进到20世纪80年代，中国感光材料界竟经历了一段最令人难忘的岁月。若不是世界彩色摄影浪潮不可阻挡地涌进中国大陆；若不是“柯达”“富士”占据了国内大小商店的柜台，中国感光材料界能如此骚动不安？然而，东方古国毕竟不乏有血性的男儿，他们要奋起抗争，把失去的阵地夺回来。可是也有人对“自己研制说”产生了怀疑，说那是一个“美丽的谬误”，主张花大价钱全套购买国外生产装置，认为只有这样才有可能赶上世界先进水平，改变外国彩色照像材料充斥中国市场的局面。1983年，这种观点居然被有关部门认可。此后，便是以数亿美元巨资从美、日“全套引进”。
    “一胶”怎么办？是坚持自力更生发展民族工业，还是也向中央伸手花大价钱成套引进？彩照热骤然升温，大引进带来的威胁，逼得“一胶”只能在狭缝里求生存！
    企业的出路在哪里？
    历史的启示又一次照亮了“一胶”人的心：
    ……暖融融的阳光照着那片玉米地，初秋的太阳仍旧晒得人身上发烫。1958年，中国古城保定集结起从南北方调来的精兵强将，在这片玉米地砍倒庄稼，豪迈地开拓一个崭新的事业。然而不久，苏联专家撤走，“自然灾害”到来，胶片厂“难产”，纸上蓝图落实到地面上仅仅是一间厂房。一到夜晚，荒郊野地，寒风凛冽，狼藉的工厂像个怪兽。在极端恶劣的条件下，“一胶”人硬是把个“先天不足”的“胎儿”生了出来。若干年后，这废墟似的“工厂”竟出息成一座名副其实的现代“胶片城”。正是在这里，他们自力更生研制出了我国第一代军用红外胶片；第一代黑白、彩色电影胶片；第一代航天遥感胶片；第一代……这里诞生过多少第一，填补了中国感光材料的多少个空白！“一胶”人永远记得那一年在人民大会堂受到周恩来总理接见时的情景。总理高扬着浓重的双眉，摆着手说：“你们就是要为中华民族争光，为中国人争气！”
    反思我国感光材料发展的历史，结论只能是这样：坚持自力更生、艰苦奋斗，“一胶”就有希望！中国的感光材料工业就有希望！
    彩色照像材料属于高科技产品，世界上只有少数几个最发达国家能够生产。不购买洋人技术依靠自己力量能搞出来吗？在厂研究所，彩色片研究室石钟豪主任讲述了几年来走过的艰难而坎坷的道路。
    1983年10月，研究所接到厂长指令，拉开攻坚战序幕。200多个日日夜夜过去了，经历了上千次的失败，直到1984年6月，终于搞出了我国第一代“乐凯”彩卷的样品。当时，真无法用语言形容科研人员激动喜悦的心情。可是，彩色多层胶片的乳剂层，包含着结构复杂、功能各异的数十种有机物，一次选择到最佳配方，决非易事。果然，试用后的消息反馈回来了。用户反映彩卷的吸水胀量大、颗粒粗。这第二道难关又立在面前。再攻，举步维艰。1984年9月，化工部秦仲达部长带领二胶、沈阳化工研究院的专家拿着自己的样品，来到厂里现场会诊，深入剖析，开展技术协作，取长补短，“乐凯”才有了新的转机，终于以彩色还原真实、层次丰富、能适应高温快速加工工艺的崭新面貌出现在中国市场上。
    活泼的阳光透过明净的玻璃窗照在石钟豪主任的脸上，他的南方口音高亢而动人。回忆了那段令人难忘的岁月之后，他说：“我们就是要为中国人争回这口气！眼看着‘柯达’‘富士’摆满我们国家大小照像馆的柜台，我们痛心！对有人说的‘不引进国外全套技术就不能在中国实现胶片的彩色化’，我们就是不服气！更让人难以忍受的是，那些年，一提倡自力更生便被说成是保护落后。他们不知道中国知识分子的心哪！在研制乐凯彩卷、相纸的那些日子，我们室的同志几乎没休过一个节假日，大年初一我们还去车间放量试验哩！大家只有一个信念，一定要早日让我们中国人自己制造的彩色胶卷和彩色相纸在市场上亮亮相！”
    是啊，所有这一切，不都是为了那个彩色的梦吗？30多年前，一群热血青年留学苏联时也几乎都做过这个多彩的梦。那是俄罗斯的一个又一个寂静而迷人的夏夜，醒了，再也睡不着，干脆捧起课本继续温习白天的功课，直至玫瑰色的晨曦悄悄爬上教堂的尖顶。后来，他们都成为了中国感光材料工业的中坚。彩色胶卷攻关组组长、高级工程师邹竞便是他们中的一个。
    哦，邹工，你此刻想到了什么？当年你从苏联留学回国，本来能分配到国家机关工作，可你听说要建设我们中国人自己的胶片厂，就舍弃了大都市生活到这里来了。你一来就赶上了三年
  “自然灾害”，睡在潮湿阴暗的库房里，喝一碗稀的地瓜粥，就这样开始了你执著追求的事业。后来，你有了孩子，在上海娘家分娩不久，就忍痛离别了小宝贝赶回保定。你想孩子，你也是一位母亲呀！你还记得那一年么？同所有知识分子一样，你也受到了非难，“特嫌”的帽子，抄家、游斗的“待遇”，都没能泯灭你的爱国之心。伴随着那个色彩纷呈的科学的春天的到来，你抢着接受了彩卷研制任务，不分昼夜地忙碌……
    还有一个小插曲。彩色片室的许明忠工程师，为了尽快拿出彩色相纸配方，身患阑尾炎，一边用手顶着肚子，一边坚持工作。大家把他架出研究室，医生让他马上住院做手术，不然就会有胃穿孔的危险。他说啥也不肯。没办法，只好让他做医务工作的妻子在他停下工作吃饭时为他注射青霉素……
    这就是“一胶”人。这就是中国当代知识分子的风采呵！
    “乐凯”在“一胶”人的精心培育下终于大放光彩。1987年销量达800万卷，在北京，“乐凯”销量超过“柯达”。
    “柯达”、“富士”独霸中国市场的局面已被打破，难道，那些不相信自己力量的悲观论调不应该扔进太平洋吗？
    当国产“乐凯”彩卷已占领了近1／3的中国彩色照像材料市场的时候，从国外花数亿美元巨资引进的全套装置还未投产。这不能不令人深思。
    在世界经济的大格局中，中国人要关起门来发展自己是不可能的。中国向世界敞开大门急切焦渴地寻求“起飞”的助力。然而在我们这个“家底”还欠丰厚的国家，如何在引进中结合自己现有的科技和工业基础，把引进与自主开发相结合？却是一个必须解决的课题。主管技术工作的副总工程师谢宜凤告诉我：“乐凯”也需要后天生长的良好环境，“一胶”走的是一条在自主开发基础上引进部分关键设备的路子，结果只花了全套引进所需外汇的十几分之一的资金，便自行设计、自行安装、辅助设备自行配套建成了一条具有世界水平的彩色胶片涂布生产线，并于1988年9月13日剪彩投产，“乐凯”终于有了走向世界的强大后盾。
    我被“一胶”人的奋斗精神深深地感动了。“一胶”人的实践表明：坚持自力更生、艰苦奋斗，民族工业大有希望！这里重要的是要依靠自己的智慧和力量，建立起自信的精神大厦。“一胶”人对彩色王国奥秘的认识和生产工艺技术诀窍的掌握，使他们在吸收和利用外来技术上有着独到的眼光和发言权，在自己新产品系列的开发和国产原材料配套上更有独到的优势。这些优势，决不是靠大量外汇能买来的！
    乐凯彩卷1988年已荣膺国家科技进步一等奖，它已开始销往东南亚和阿拉伯国家，还打进了号称“胶片王国”的美国的市场。但“一胶”人并没有满足，他们的目标是要攀登国际感光材料那色彩更为绚丽迷人的最高峰。
    如果你有幸置身于我国北方这座现代化“胶片城”，你就会感到“一胶”人的志向不是浮夸。他们的令中国人扬眉吐气的彩色梦想一定能付诸实施，新一代BR—100型彩卷已经可以毫无愧怍地与那些世界名牌比肩，乐凯彩色相纸质量已达到国际水平。在“一胶”的职教中心，在研究所，在新建成的彩色胶片涂布生产线，在办公大楼，在职工们那一张张充满自信的脸上，你会感到“一胶”蕴含着的那股回天之力！
    这次“一胶”之行没能见到陈兆初厂长，没能听这位我国民族感光材料工业的开拓者倾吐他所感受到的艰难与沉重，然而他曾经说过的一句话却牢牢印在我的脑际：“走自己的路，去开拓我们民族感光材料工业全新的未来！”
    是的，从“一胶”人的充满信念和力量的瞳仁里，我们已经看到了这个未来的曙光！
