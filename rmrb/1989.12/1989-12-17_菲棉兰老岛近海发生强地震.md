A strong earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale struck the coastal waters east of Mindanao Island in the southern Philippines at 2:44 a.m. local time on the 16th. The quake resulted in at least one death and the collapse of several buildings. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology confirmed that this was the strongest earthquake to hit the area in nearly thirteen years.

Initial reports following the earthquake indicated that a boy in the coastal city of Bislig, Surigao del Sur province, was killed when a building collapsed. No other casualties have been reported. The earthquake observation station in Bislig was also damaged, and the city's power supply was disrupted.

According to the Institute, the epicenter of the earthquake was located at 8.4 degrees north latitude and 126.8 degrees east longitude, approximately 840 kilometers from the capital, Manila.
