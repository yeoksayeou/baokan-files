The image depicts a scene on Arbat Street in Moscow, where artists paint portraits for tourists or passersby. Arbat Street is not very long but is rich in historical relics. Both sides of the street have various gift shops and stalls selling handicrafts and artworks. The street is closed to vehicular traffic. This street was once paved with asphalt and allowed cars to pass. However, Moscow residents fondly remember this old street. Therefore, the government repaved it with cobblestones, banned vehicles, and restored its historical appearance.

    图为莫斯科阿尔巴特步行街上画家为旅游者或过路人画像的情景。阿尔巴特街是一条并不太长，但有不少历史遗迹的马路。街道两边有各种出售工艺品和各种艺术作品的礼品店或路摊，车辆不准通行。这条马路曾一度被铺上沥青，并让汽车通行。但莫斯科人怀念这条古老的小街。于是政府又铺上石块，禁止车辆通行，恢复了它的历史原貌。　张允文摄
