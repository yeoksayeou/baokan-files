Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd

Editor's Note: As the year comes to an end, the international situation, which has been turbulent throughout the year, is undergoing significant changes. In early December, the China International Studies Center invited scholars and experts on international issues from Beijing and other regions to discuss the international situation in 1989 and the outlook for 1990. The experts and scholars present expressed their views, offering diverse opinions. The following is a compilation of their views for readers to refer to when understanding international issues.

The Evolution of the World Order and Situation

In analyzing the developments in the international situation this year, many scholars have a common view: the overall world order has not changed, and the two trends of moving from tension to détente and from confrontation to dialogue are still developing. However, under this trend of détente, new complex and turbulent factors have emerged in the international situation, leading to drastic changes in certain aspects. In the future, it is possible that local tensions and turmoil will occur.

Some experts believe that the current level of military confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the level of confrontation between the two major military blocs, is showing signs of further decline. The two countries may reach an agreement to reduce strategic nuclear weapons by 50%, and negotiations on chemical weapons and conventional arms are also expected to make progress. Regional conflict hotspots continue to cool down. Apart from the political resolution of the situation in Southern Africa, other issues such as Cambodia, Central America, and the Middle East have also, to varying degrees, strengthened the trend towards political resolution. However, at the same time, it is impossible to ignore that in the East-West relationship, as military confrontation eases, political dialogue develops, and economic exchanges increase, political, economic, and ideological struggles have become sharp and complex, and even quite intense under certain conditions and within certain scopes. This situation has led to a series of changes in the balance of power within countries, in some regions, and in international relations, while a new balance of power is yet to be formed, adding uncertainty to the world situation. At the same time, the changes in the world have accelerated the trend towards multipolarity. In the interplay between the bipolar system and multipolar development, and in the competition and mutual restraint among various forces, the international balance of power and its composition will continue to change.

Currently, there is a view internationally that with the détente in the international situation and the emergence of a multipolar world, especially the rapid developments in the European situation, the post-war Cold War situation has ended, and the Yalta system is disintegrating. On this, the scholars present had different views. Some believe that in terms of world wars, there has been no major conflict since 1945, and the Cold War is a cold peace; or it is a coexistence characterized by the Cold War. Currently, it cannot be said that the Cold War has ended because the arms race between the two superpowers has not stopped, the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union has not ceased, and the military blocs that are products of the Cold War still exist. However, others believe that the concept of "Cold War" has its specific meaning. Due to the changes in the European situation, the traditional East-West Cold War has ended or is about to end, and the stage of the Cold War, which is mainly characterized by military means, may be replaced by different forms of intense struggle. The comprehensive national power competition among countries, including political, economic, military, and cultural aspects, will become even more intense. Some pointed out that from a historical perspective, the international strategic landscape changes approximately every 30-50 years. From the Treaty of Versailles to the Yalta Agreement was a major change, and from the Yalta Agreement to the recent U.S.-Soviet Malta "understanding," can we say that we have reached a turning point in the post-war situation? There is a view that the rise of Japan and Western Europe, the drastic changes in the situation in Eastern Europe, the relative decline of the U.S.-Soviet bipolarity, and the rapid development of the trend towards multipolarity have all formed a strong impact on the Yalta system. The Yalta system is currently in the process of disintegration.

Everyone agreed that despite the significant changes in the international situation, peace and development remain the themes of the current era and the urgent demands of the people of all countries. Although the world has shifted from tension to détente, it will not be completely peaceful, and the danger of war still exists. Even if the United States and the Soviet Union reach an agreement to reduce strategic nuclear weapons by 50%, they still possess strategic weapons with the capability to destroy the world multiple times and continue to engage in high-tech arms races. The comprehensive national power competition, with a focus on economics and technology, will enter an important stage. The world's regional "hotspots" are still difficult to eliminate, and new hotspots may emerge due to the appearance of new turmoil. Some Western notables have predicted that in the future, "it will be a period of both historic opportunities and great dangers."

The Current State of East-West Relations and the European Situation

The development of East-West relations and the changes in the European situation have attracted the attention of the scholars and experts present. Some pointed out: if in the past, the U.S.-Soviet struggle was more focused on the periphery of Europe, now, with the changes in the European situation, this struggle has entered the interior of this key region. Europe is undergoing profound changes since the war. This trend will undoubtedly have a great and far-reaching impact on the European situation and will affect the global situation.

In the current East-West relations, how to assess the situation of the United States and the Soviet Union? The scholars present had differing views. One view is that the détente that began in the mid-1980s is that the U.S.-Soviet struggle has shifted from the Soviet offensive and U.S. defense of the 1970s to U.S. offensive and Soviet defense. Another view is that current international relations are more complex, and it can be said that "competition and cooperation coexist, struggle and coordination coexist," and it is not appropriate to observe with a black-and-white mindset. Some believe that in the current East-West relations represented by the United States and the Soviet Union, there is new complexity, with both competitive and convergent aspects. However, some disagree with this view, believing that fundamentally and in the long term, the fundamental contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union will deepen. The fundamental strategic goal of the United States is not only to gain an advantage over the Soviet Union but also to attempt to change the socialist system in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, while the fundamental strategic goal of the Soviet Union is to maintain parity with the United States. The United States and the Soviet Union will continue to compete and struggle on many issues.

A notable event in the current East-West relations is the drastic changes in the situation in Eastern Europe. Scholars believe that the causes of the changes in Eastern Europe, when viewed externally, include influences from both the West and the East; internally, there are economic, political, social, and historical factors. When discussing external influences, scholars mentioned the issue of Western countries strengthening the "peaceful evolution" of socialist countries. Some scholars pointed out that in observing East-West relations in the past, although the "peaceful evolution" strategy of the West was noticed, it was not fully recognized. After several months of observing the situation, there is a clearer understanding of the offensive of the West's "peaceful evolution." The United States and other Western countries are focusing on using political, economic, and ideological means to actively attack socialist countries, coordinating their steps and implementing a policy of differentiated treatment.

Scholars emphasized the analysis of the U.S. strategy of "beyond containment" towards the Soviet Union, believing that first, this strategy is not an abandonment but an inheritance of the containment strategy that has been followed for decades. However, it is not a simple inheritance but a development based on inheritance. The "beyond containment" strategy is no longer the strategy of "containing" and "pushing back" communist influence of the past, but rather a strategy of using the difficulties faced by the Soviet Union and Eastern countries to wage a "war without gunpowder" in the form of détente and ultimately eliminate communism. Therefore, in essence, this is not a strategy of East-West cooperation; it is more aggressive, only changing from hard confrontation to soft confrontation with economic incentives, using the "carrot and stick" policy, emphasizing political, economic, and ideological struggles, and elevating "peaceful evolution" to the dominant position in policy.

Facing the turbulent situation in Eastern Europe, scholars generally believe that it is necessary to observe calmly because various internal and external factors are at play, and it is difficult to determine the direction of the situation in the short term. People pointed out that although the situation is severe and potential crises are lurking, the ultimate decisive factor is still the people. Currently, it can be seen that while there is turmoil, some counteracting forces are also emerging. Those who insist on the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist path are actively working, seeking the correct path of reform, and striving to ensure that the development of the situation will not completely follow the tracks planned by some people. From the historical perspective, the current changes are just one round in the historical competition between the two systems. Capitalism, in its development process, has also experienced setbacks and has gone through several hundred years of history to consolidate and develop, constantly facing crises. The socialist system, which has only been in existence for a few decades, will also undergo a long and tortuous process to perfect, consolidate, and develop, and to fully demonstrate its superiority.

What impact will the changes in the European situation have on East-West relations? On this, scholars made various estimates: on the one hand, it breaks through the bipolar structure, shakes the Yalta system, and weakens the basis for the existence of the two military blocs, further reducing the control of the two superpowers over their respective allies; on the other hand, it may promote the process of European disarmament, but it may also, due to some uncertain factors, lead to a reversal of East-West relations. A current important development is the prominence of the issue of German reunification. Scholars generally believe that the prospect of the unification of the two Germanys and ultimately the reunification of Germany will give rise to a new power in Europe, which will inevitably break the current balance of power in Europe and bring about major changes in European unity and East-West relations. This is not something that the four major powers and other European countries would like to see, so it is not something that can be achieved in the near future. However, the trend of German unification is also difficult to suppress, and Europe's search for new combinations and balances seems inevitable. However, the scholars present also believe that to prevent the European situation from spiraling out of control, the United States and the Soviet Union may also reach a tacit agreement and cooperate, continuing to use their bipolar system to restrain their respective European allies. Recently, the summit meeting between the U.S. and Soviet leaders in Malta has shown this intention.

Beyond the Bipolar World: Areas That Cannot Be Ignored

Scholars pointed out that in observing the international situation, one should not only focus on the changes in East-West relations and the world strategic landscape but also pay attention to the issues of South-North relations, the Third World, and relations within the West. Important changes are also taking place in these areas.

When discussing South-North relations and the issues of the Third World, scholars pointed out that the economic gap between the South and the North is further widening. The unreasonable international economic order benefits Western countries in using their financial and technological advantages to expand this gap. The low prices of raw materials, the heavy debt burden of $1320 billion, and the protectionist tendencies of developed countries all make Third World countries face a severe international economic environment. Western developed countries are using the economic difficulties of the Third World to strengthen economic exploitation and pressure, and they are also trying to impose a set of Western political, economic, and ideological systems on the South, making the contradictions between the South and the North more prominent. The difficulties faced by the South in development make the international situation breed various tensions and instabilities.

It is worth noting that while Europe is in turmoil, the Asia-Pacific region is relatively stable, and its economic development is outstanding. Its status in the world is further improving. China, the Asian Four Little Dragons, and ASEAN countries, as well as South Asian countries, have made significant economic progress in the past decade. Although some countries have faced the problem of economic structural adjustment in recent years, they still maintain a strong momentum of development. The United States and Japan, while seeking to establish a "global partnership," are also further competing for the Asia-Pacific region. The economic rise of the Asia-Pacific region will have a significant impact on the world economic landscape, and the trend of economic regionalization and bloc formation in this region is attracting close attention.

In the relations among Western countries, the contradictions among developed countries are also showing signs of further intensification. These contradictions sometimes reach a very intense level. Although they coordinate at meetings such as the Seven-Power Summit to dominate international affairs for their common interests, with the political and economic multipolarization, the European Community, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan are becoming strong rivals of the United States. This contradiction is not only developing into multi-bloc competition in the economy but also increasingly developing into a struggle for leadership in Europe and Asia between the United States and Western Europe, and between the United States and Japan. Currently, the contradictions between the United States and Japan are particularly prominent. The economic contradictions between them are structural contradictions, belonging to the irreconcilable conflicts of interest in the system. In the Asia-Pacific region, the United States will face increasing challenges from the rise of Japanese power to maintain its advantage. Within the European Community, the power of the Federal Republic of Germany will continue to grow. Its contradictions with the United States, France, and other Western European countries will further develop. In the issue of German reunification, there have been signs of some Western European countries and the Soviet Union jointly restraining West Germany. The contradictions between the United States and Europe and within the European Community may affect the process of European unity.

Outlook and Reflection

The 1980s are coming to an end, and as we look ahead to the new year of the 1990s, the scholars present believe that due to the emergence of various unstable factors, the outlook is still unclear, and international relations may undergo various structural changes. The old post-war system is shaking, and the new order has not yet been fully established. Various political forces will re-divide and recombine, and the world may be in the process of a major transition between the old and the new, requiring the establishment of a new international political and economic order. The détente between the East and the West will continue, but the turmoil in Europe will also continue. The trend of independence and autonomy in European countries is strengthening, and the hegemony of the two superpowers is declining. Détente will be a tortuous process full of contradictions and struggles, oppositions and conflicts, compromises, and cooperation. At the same time, the gap between the South and the North will further widen, and the economic situation in the South may worsen, leading to political instability and social turmoil. The intention of the South to unite to strengthen negotiations with the North will increase. The economy of the Asia-Pacific region will have significant development, and its status is rising. All sides will make new efforts to seek the establishment of a new political and economic order. In summary, the development of the situation is full of dangers and challenges, but it also has hope and opportunities.

Some experts pointed out that last year, when scholars from various countries estimated the situation in 1989, no one expected such a rapid and sudden situation to emerge, which requires us, who engage in international studies, to seriously consider various complex factors and not to look at problems from a single perspective. We should observe and analyze the international situation with an objective, calm, and long-term perspective, using dialectical methods, conducting more investigations and research, understanding the actual situation, and making judgments that conform to reality.

Scholars proposed that in this turbulent and rapidly changing international situation, China, after the suppression of the riots, has proven to be able to quickly stabilize and stand firmly in the East. This is mainly because we have adopted the correct policies and guidelines. Although the current international situation has both favorable and unfavorable factors for us, as long as we firmly adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, adhere to the policy of independence and self-reliance, and focus on governance and rectification, and develop our economy, we will be able to turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones and stand unshakable. The stability of China's situation will have a positive impact on the peace and stability of the world situation.

    缓和  动荡  激变  分化
    ——学者、专家们对国际形势的回顾与展望
    本报记者　席林生　丹林　黄晴
    编者按：时届岁末，历经一年动荡的国际形势正在发生巨大的变化。12月上旬，中国国际问题研究中心邀集了北京和外地的国际问题学者和专家，座谈讨论1989年国际形势和1990年的展望。与会的专家和学者各抒己见，发表了各家之言。现将他们的看法整理刊出，供读者了解国际问题时参考。世界格局与形势的演变
    在分析今年国际形势的演变中，许多学者的一个普遍观点是：世界总的格局没有变化，两个转向，即从紧张走向缓和，从对抗走向对话的趋势仍在发展。但在这种缓和的趋势下，国际形势出现了新的复杂、动荡的因素，造成了某些方面急剧的变化。今后不排除发生局部紧张和动荡的可能。
    一些专家认为，当前美苏军事对抗水平，两大军事集团的对抗水平有进一步下降之势，苏美之间有可能达成削减50％战略核武器的协议，在化学武器和常规军备方面的谈判也有望取得进展；地区冲突热点继续降温，除南部非洲已接近完成政治解决外，其他如柬埔寨问题，中美洲问题，中东问题，也都或多或少加强了政治解决的趋向。但是，与此同时，人们不能不看到，东西方关系中，在军事对抗缓和、政治对话以及经济交往发展之中，政治、经济、意识形态等方面的斗争变得尖锐复杂起来，在一定条件和范围内甚至相当激烈。这种局面致使一连串国家内部、一些地区和国际关系中旧的力量均衡被打破，而新的力量均衡还有待形成，世界形势因此增加了不确定的因素。同时，世界的变动也加快了多极化趋势的发展。在两极体系和多极化发展相互抗衡中，在各种力量相互竞争和制约中，国际力量对比和组合将不断发生新的变化。
    现在国际上有一种看法：随着国际形势的缓和和多极化世界的出现，特别当前欧洲局势的迅速发展，战后以来的冷战局面已经结束，雅尔塔体制走向瓦解。对此，与会学者有不同的看法。有人认为，就世界性的大战而言，1945年后一直没打起来，冷战就是冷和平；或者说是以冷战为特征的共处局面。目前还不能说冷战已经结束，因为两个超级大国的军备竞赛还没有停止，美苏的争夺还没有罢手，作为冷战的产物的两个军事集团还存在。但也有人认为，“冷战”这一概念有它特定的含义。由于欧洲形势的变化，传统意义上的东西方冷战已经或行将结束，以军事手段为主的冷战阶段可能会被不同形式的激烈斗争所取代，各国包括政治、经济、军事、文化内容在内的综合国力竞争，还会更加激烈。有人指出，从世界历史的角度看，国际战略格局大约30—50年有一大变，从凡尔赛和约到雅尔塔协议是一大变，从雅尔塔协议到最近美苏马耳他“谅解”，可否说又到了战后形势的一个转折点。有一种观点认为，日本、西欧的崛起，东欧局势的急剧变化，苏美两极的相对衰落和多极化趋势的迅速发展，这些均对雅尔塔体制形成强大冲击。雅尔塔体制目前正处于瓦解的过程中。
    大家认为，尽管国际形势发生了很大的变化，和平与发展仍然是当前时代的主题，是各国人民迫切的要求。世界虽然从紧张转向了缓和，但也不会太平无事，战争的危险仍然存在。美苏即使达成了削减50％的战略核武器的协议，它们仍然掌握着可以毁灭世界多次的超杀伤能力的战略武器，而且还在继续进行高技术军备竞赛。以经济和科技为重点的综合国力竞赛将进入重要阶段。世界的地区“热点”还难以消除，由于新的动荡的出现，还可能出现新的热点。有些西方知名人士预言，未来，“既是历史性的机会，又是有巨大危险的时期”。
    东西方关系的现状与欧洲的形势
    东西方关系的发展以及欧洲形势的变化引起了与会学者和专家们的极大注意。有人指出：如果说过去美苏的争夺还侧重于欧洲的外围的话，现在，随着欧洲形势的变化，这种争夺已进入欧洲这一重点地区的内部。欧洲正在发生战后以来深刻的变化。这一态势无疑对欧洲的形势将发生巨大而深远的影响，并将牵动世界的全局。
    在当前东西方关系中，如何估计美苏双方的态势？与会的学者们看法不尽相同。一种见解认为，80年代中期开始的缓和在于美苏间的争夺已从70年代的苏攻美守变为美攻苏守。另一种见解认为，当今国际关系更为复杂，可以说“竞争与合作同在，争夺与协调并存”，不宜再用非此即彼的思维方式去观察。也有人认为，当前以美苏为代表的东西方关系中出现了新的复杂性，既有相互争夺的一面，又有利益吻合的一面。但有人不同意这种看法，认为从根本上看，从长远看，美苏之间的实质矛盾将进一步加深。美国的根本战略目标不仅是要取得对苏优势，而是企图改变苏联、东欧的社会主义制度，而苏联的根本战略目标则是要保持同美国的均势。苏美在许多问题上都仍将继续进行较量和争夺。
    当前东西方关系中一个引人注目的事件是东欧局势的急剧变化。学者们认为，东欧局势的变化，究其原因，从外部看，既有西方也有东方的影响；从内部看，有经济、政治、社会、历史等多方面的原因。学者们在探讨其外部影响时，谈到了西方国家对社会主义各国加强
  “和平演变”的问题。有的学者提出，过去在观察东西方关系时，对西方的“和平演变”策略，虽然也看到它们一直在搞，但缺乏足够的认识，经过这几个月的形势观察，对西方“和平演变”的攻势有了清醒的认识。美国和西方其他国家正在着重使用政治、经济、意识形态等手段，向社会主义国家积极进攻，它们协调了步骤，实行区别对待的政策。
    学者们着重分析了美国制定的对苏“超越遏制战略”，认为，首先，这一战略不是放弃而是对奉行数十年的遏制战略的继承；但它不是简单的继承，而是在继承基础上的发展。“超越遏制战略”已不再是过去那种“遏制”、“推回”共产主义影响的战略，而是利用苏联和东方国家处境困难之机，在缓和的形式下打一场“没有硝烟的战争”并最终消灭共产主义的战略。因此，就其本质而言，这不是东西方合作的战略，它具有更大的进攻性，只是在手法中由硬对抗转变为以经济为诱饵，运用“大棒加胡萝卜”的软对抗政策，突出了政治、经济与意识形态的斗争，把“和平演变”上升到政策的主导地位。
    面对东欧的动荡形势，学者们较多的认为应该冷静观察，因为各种内外因素都在发挥作用，局势往哪个方向发展一时还难断定。人们指出，尽管局势是严峻的，潜伏着种种危机，但最终起决定作用的还是人民。目前，可以看到，在动荡的同时，一些相反的制约的力量也在出现。坚持共产党的领导和社会主义道路的人也在积极展开工作，寻找正确的改革道路，正努力使事态的发展不会完全沿着某些人规划的轨道前进。从历史的长河看，当前的变动只是两种制度历史性竞赛中的一个回合。资本主义制度在其发展过程中也曾经出现过反复，经过了几百年的历程才巩固和发展起来，而且不断遭到危机。刚刚诞生才几十年的社会主义制度要完善、巩固和发展起来，要充分显示其优越性，同样要经历一个长期、曲折的过程。“一个很久没有打开的水龙头一旦打开时，首先流出的是混水，然后才是清水”，有的学者在发言中用这样的形象语言描绘了这种历史发展的趋势。
    欧洲局势的变化对东西方关系带来何种影响？对此，学者们作了种种的估计：它一方面突破了两极格局，动摇了雅尔塔体制，瓦解两个军事集团存在的基础，进一步削弱两个超级大国对各自盟国的控制能力；另方面它既可能推动欧洲裁军的进程，也可能由于某些不确定因素引起东西方关系的逆转。当前一个重要的事态是使两德统一问题突出了出来。学者们比较一致的看法是：两德联合以致最后重新统一的前景将使欧洲崛起一个新的强国，它必将打破欧洲现有的力量对比，使欧洲的联合和东西方的关系发生重大变化。这不是四大国和其他欧洲国家所乐于见到的，因此不是近期内能够实现的。但是，两德联合的趋势也难以抑制，欧洲寻求新的组合与平衡看来不可避免。但是，与会学者也认为，为了防止欧洲局势发展失控，美苏也可能共同达成默契，进行合作，继续利用它们的两极体系来制约各自的欧洲盟国。最近，美苏首脑马耳他会晤，就显示了这方面的意向。
    两极之外：不可忽视的领域
    学者们指出，在观察国际形势时，不能只重视东西方关系和世界战略格局的变化而忽视了南北关系问题，第三世界的问题，西方内部关系问题。在这些领域中同样发生着重要的变化。
    在谈到南北关系和第三世界的问题时，学者们指出，南北之间的经济差距仍在进一步拉大，不合理的国际经济秩序有利于西方国家运用其金融、技术优势以扩大这一差距，原材料价格偏低、高达13200亿美元的沉重债务负担，发达国家的保护主义倾向，均使第三世界国家面临严峻的国际经济环境。西方发达国家利用第三世界经济困难，正加强对南方的经济剥削和压力，而且企图把一套西方的政治经济制度和意识形态等强加于南方，使南北之间的矛盾更加突出。南方国家在发展上遇到的困难使国际局势孕育着种种紧张和不稳定的因素。
    值得注意的，在欧洲发生动荡的情况下，亚太地区相对比较平稳，经济发展也一枝独秀，它在世界上的地位正在进一步提高。中国，亚洲四小和东盟各国以及南亚国家在过去十年中经济有长足发展，近年一些国家虽面对经济结构调整问题，但仍保持相当强劲的发展势头。美国和日本之间在谋求建立“全球性伙伴关系”的同时，也在进一步开展争夺亚太地区。亚太地区经济上的崛起将对世界经济格局产生重大影响，这一地区的经济区域化，集团化趋势正引起人们的密切关注。
    在西方国家关系问题上，发达国家之间的矛盾，也在呈现进一步加剧的趋势。这种矛盾有时达到十分激烈的程度。尽管它们为了共同的利益，也在七国首脑等会议上不时进行协调，以主宰国际事务，但随着政治上、经济上的多极化，欧洲共同体、联邦德国和日本正在成为美国的强劲的对手。这种矛盾不仅在经济上发展为多集团的竞争，而且在政治上日益发展成美国同西欧、美国同日本之间分别争夺在欧洲和亚洲地区的主导地位的斗争。当前，美日的矛盾十分突出，它们之间经济上的矛盾是结构性的矛盾，属于体制上的不可调和的利害冲突。而在亚太地区，美国要继续保持它的优势，将越来越受到日本力量崛起的挑战。在欧洲共同体内部，联邦德国力量将日益增强。它同美、法等西欧其它国家的矛盾将会进一步发展。在德国统一问题上出现了一些西欧国家同苏联共同制约西德的动向。美欧和欧共体内的这种矛盾有可能影响西欧联合的进程。
    展望与思考
    80年代即将过去，展望90年代新的一年，与会学者们认为由于诸多不稳定因素的出现，前景还不明朗，国际关系可能会发生多种结构性变化。战后旧的体制动摇了，新的秩序尚未完全建立，各种政治力量将重新分化和组合，世界很可能处在新旧交替的大变动的过程中，要求建立国际政治和经济新秩序的呼声将会增强。东西方的缓和将继续下去，但欧洲的动荡必将继续下去，欧洲各国的独立自主倾向在加强，两超霸权地位在下降，缓和将是一个充满矛盾和斗争、对立和冲突、妥协和合作的曲折过程。与此同时，南北之间的差距将会进一步拉大，南方经济形势还可能恶化，从而导致政局不稳、社会动荡。南方国家谋求联合以增强同北方谈判的意向会增长。而亚太地区经济将有大的发展，地位正在上升。各方将为寻求建立新的政治和经济秩序作出新的努力。总之，形势的发展既充满危险和挑战，也具有希望和机会。
    一些专家提出，去年各国学者估计1989年的形势时，谁都没有预料到会出现这样迅猛而突发性的局面，这就需要我们从事国际问题研究的人认真思考各种复杂的因素，不能简单地从一个方面看问题。要以客观、冷静、长远的眼光，用辩证的方法来观察和分析国际形势，多作调查研究，了解实际情况，作出符合实际的判断。
    学者们提出，在这动荡、剧烈变化的国际形势下，我国经过平暴，证明能够迅速稳定，屹立在东方，这主要是因为我们采取了正确的方针和政策。尽管目前国际形势对我们既有有利的因素，也有不利的因素，但只要坚定不移地坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放、坚持独立自主、自力更生为主的方针，把治理整顿搞好，把我国的经济搞上去，我们就能化不利因素为有利因素，而立于不败之地。中国局势的稳定将对世界局势的和平与稳定产生积极的影响。
