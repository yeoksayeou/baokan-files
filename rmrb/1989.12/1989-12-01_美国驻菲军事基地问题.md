In August, the Singaporean government expressed its willingness to provide military base facilities to the United States, in case negotiations over U.S. bases in the Philippines break down and the U.S. withdraws from the Philippines, so that the U.S. can maintain its military presence in Southeast Asia. This move has once again drawn the attention of relevant countries and public opinion to the issue of U.S. military bases in the Philippines.

The history of U.S. military bases in the Philippines can be traced back to the late 19th to early 20th century. In 1898, the Spanish-American War ended with Spain's defeat, and the U.S. and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, stipulating that the Philippines would be transferred from Spanish to U.S. rule. From then on, the U.S. began its occupation of the Philippines. At the same time, the U.S. began to take over and gradually operate its military bases in the Philippines. In July 1946, the Philippines declared independence. The following year, in March, the U.S. and the Philippine governments signed the U.S.-Philippine Military Base Agreement, stipulating that the U.S. would use the bases in the Philippines for a period of 99 years. In 1966, the two sides changed the lease period of the bases to 25 years, which would expire on September 16, 1991.

The main U.S. bases in the Philippines are two: one is the Clark Air Base in Pampanga Province, and the other is the Subic Naval Base, located 80 kilometers west of Manila. The two bases together house more than 17,000 military personnel. These are the largest U.S. military bases overseas. They control the maritime routes from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, supporting U.S. military deployments in East Asia and the Indian Ocean-Persian Gulf region. The naval and air facilities here are not only the main logistics and ship repair sites for the U.S. Seventh Fleet but also the transportation hubs for supporting U.S. military activities and operations in the Indian Ocean.

However, the existence of these two military bases has become one of the most troublesome issues for the United States. Since the end of World War II, and especially since the 1960s, reclaiming bases and safeguarding national sovereignty have become major goals in the political struggles of many countries. In early 1986, after the change of government in the Philippines, due to domestic political reasons and as the base lease period approached, the issue of U.S. bases in the Philippines became even more prominent. Although the U.S. and the Philippines had signed a military base agreement amendment in October 1979, allowing the Philippines to symbolically own the bases, actual control remained in the hands of the United States. The large U.S. military bases remained "a state within a state" in the Philippines, seriously damaging the Philippines' sovereignty and national interests. Therefore, the Filipino people believe that the existence of U.S. military bases undermines the image of the Philippines as a truly independent democratic country. They demand that the U.S. military withdraw after the lease period expires, and this call is growing stronger. In addition, in recent years, the U.S. government's fiscal revenue has been declining, and budget balancing and spending cuts have limited U.S. economic and military aid to the Philippines and other countries, which has undoubtedly sparked stronger dissatisfaction within the Philippines.

To ensure continued use of the bases after the lease period expires, the U.S. has been negotiating with the Philippines on the future of the bases since the later period of the Reagan administration. On October 17 of last year, the two countries reached an agreement, with the U.S. government agreeing to increase the annual base rent from the current $180 million to $480 million and continue negotiations on the future of the bases. The new base rent, although increased, is still far from the Philippines' demand of $1.2 billion per year. Therefore, the Philippines has not made any commitments on the base renewal issue.

Recently, the United States and the Philippines agreed to hold talks in December this year on the issue of whether to retain the U.S. military bases in the Philippines. It is generally believed that the U.S. will strive to maintain its right to continue using the bases in the Philippines. On November 9, Bush said during a welcome ceremony for Mrs. Aquino's visit to the U.S., "We have confidence in reaching a new long-term agreement that benefits both sides to retain the military bases," which is a proof of this. It is estimated that the U.S. will adopt a combination of soft and hard tactics in future negotiations and will use the wishes of ASEAN, Japan, and other countries that do not want the U.S. military to withdraw from the Philippines, as well as the unstable factors in the domestic situation of the Philippines, to force the Philippines to comply. At the same time, the U.S. is also actively seeking alternative bases in the Western Pacific region. However, reports indicate that the U.S. is unlikely to build such bases in other Southeast Asian countries. There is news that after multiple inspections of Singapore, the U.S. believes that Singapore's base facilities are difficult to replace the Clark and Subic bases. A more likely scenario is that the U.S. will use more military facilities in Singapore in the future. On the other hand, the Philippines will, on the premise of safeguarding its national sovereignty and national interests, aim to ensure the security of the Southeast Asian region and consider the serious economic difficulties facing the country, to seek a proper solution. It is believed that the Philippines may use the importance of the two bases to U.S. global strategic interests to force the U.S. to make concessions on issues such as rent and aid, to gain as much benefit as possible for itself. However, the possibility of a breakdown in U.S.-Philippine negotiations, or due to strong anti-U.S. sentiment within the Philippines, leading to the Philippines reclaiming the two U.S. bases on schedule, still exists. The future of the U.S. military bases in the Philippines remains to be seen.

    美国驻菲军事基地问题
    许晓松
    今年8月，新加坡政府表示愿向美国提供军事基地设施，以便一旦美菲基地谈判破裂，美从菲律宾撤出后，能保留美在东南亚的军事存在。此举再次引起有关国家及舆论对美在菲军事基地问题的关注。
    美国在菲律宾基地的历史可追溯到上个世纪末至本世纪初。1898年，美西战争以西班牙战败告终，美西签订《巴黎协定》，规定菲律宾由西班牙转让给美国统治。从此，开始了美国对菲律宾的占领历史。与此同时，美国开始接管并逐步经营其在菲军事基地。1946年7月，菲律宾宣布独立。次年3月，美国和菲律宾政府签订《美菲军事基地协定》，规定美国对菲律宾基地的使用期限为99年。1966年，双方将基地的租期改为25年，即到1991年9月16日，美国对菲律宾基地的租期届满。
    美国在菲律宾的基地主要有两处：一个是位于邦板牙省的克拉克空军基地，另一个是位于马尼拉以西80公里处的苏比克海军基地。两个基地共驻有1.7万余名军事人员。这是美国在海外规模最大的两个军事基地。它们扼太平洋通往印度洋的交通要道，支持着美国部署在东亚和印度洋——波斯湾地区的军事力量。这里的海、空军设施既是美第7舰队的主要后勤补给和舰船维修地，又是支援美军在印度洋的军事活动和作战的运输枢纽。
    然而，这两处军事基地的存在目前已成为美国最棘手的一个问题。第二次世界大战后，特别是60年代以来，收回基地、维护国家主权已成为许多国家人民政治斗争的一个主要目标。1986年初，菲律宾政权更迭后，由于菲国内政治原因，并随着基地租约期满日益临近，美国在菲律宾基地问题更形突出。虽然美菲在此之前于1979年10月签订过军事基地协定修正案，菲律宾得以象征性地拥有对基地的主权，但实际控制权仍掌握在美国手中。庞大的美军基地仍是菲律宾境内的“国中之国”，严重损害了菲律宾的主权和民族利益。因此，菲律宾人民认为，美军基地的存在有损于菲律宾作为一个真正独立的民主国家的形象。他们从维护国家主权和民族利益出发，要求美军在租约期满后撤出的呼声日益强烈。此外，近年来美国政府的财政收入每况愈下，平衡预算削减开支限制了美国对菲律宾等国的经济和军事援助，这无疑也引起菲律宾国内更强烈的不满。
    美国方面为了在租约期满后能继续使用这些基地，从里根政府后期起，就同菲方开始就基地前途等问题进行谈判。去年10月17日，美菲两国达成协议，美国政府允诺把每年给菲的基地租金由目前的1.8亿美元增至4.8亿美元，并继续谈判基地的前途。新的基地租金虽增加了许多，但与菲律宾提出的每年12亿美元的要求还相差甚远，因此，菲律宾方面在基地续约问题上始终未做承诺。
    不久前，美国和菲律宾一致同意在今年12月就美驻菲军事基地的去留问题举行会谈。一般认为，美将力保对菲基地的继续使用权。11月9日，布什在欢迎阿基诺夫人访美时说，美国有信心“达成这项新的并且使双方受益的保留军事基地的长期协议”，就是一个证明。估计美国在未来的谈判中将采取软硬兼施的手段，并会利用东盟、日本等国不愿美军从菲律宾撤出的愿望，以及菲律宾国内局势尚存不稳因素等情况，逼菲就范。与此同时，美国也在西太平洋地区积极寻求替代基地。但据报道，美国不大可能在其它东南亚国家另建此类基地。有消息说，美国经过对新加坡多次考察后认为，新加坡的基地设施很难代替克拉克和苏比克这两个基地。较有可能出现的情况是，美在今后会更多地使用在新加坡的军事设施。另一方面，菲律宾也将在维护本国主权和民族利益的前提下，从确保东南亚地区安全的愿望出发，并考虑到本国面临严重的经济困难这一情况，力图寻求一个妥善解决的办法。据认为，菲律宾可能利用两基地对美国全球战略利益的重要性，迫使美国在租金及援助数额等问题上做出让步，为自己争取尽可能多的利益。但是，美菲谈判破裂，或者由于菲国内强烈的反美情绪，导致菲律宾按期收回美军这两个基地的可能性依然存在。关于美国驻菲军事基地问题的前途，还要待以时日才能见分晓。
