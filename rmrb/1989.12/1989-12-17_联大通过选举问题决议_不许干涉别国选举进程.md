People's Daily, United Nations, December 15th.

The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly today passed by an overwhelming majority a resolution titled "Respect for National Sovereignty and Non-Interference in the Electoral Processes of Other Countries."

The draft resolution, jointly proposed by China and 13 other countries, states that any direct or indirect interference in the electoral processes of other countries, especially developing countries, or attempts to alter the results of such elections, violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.

The Assembly called on all countries not to provide financial support or other forms of open or covert assistance to political parties or groups in other countries.

The Assembly also condemned the use of force or threats of force against the peoples, elected governments, or legitimate leaders of other countries.

Today's session also passed another resolution on election issues, emphasizing that "every member of the international community has the obligation to respect the decisions made by other countries in freely choosing and developing their electoral systems."

The draft resolution was finalized after a struggle in the Third Committee of the General Assembly in late November. During the meeting, the United States and 24 other countries initially proposed a draft that attempted to impose the Western electoral model on other countries. China and 10 other countries proposed an amendment emphasizing that each country has the right to choose its own electoral system. This amendment was accepted by the representatives of the countries present.

    联大通过选举问题决议
    不许干涉别国选举进程
    本报联合国12月15日电　记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天以压倒多数通过了一项题为《尊重国家主权和不干涉别国选举进程》的决议。
    包括中国在内的14个国家共同提出的这项决议草案指出，任何直接或间接地干涉别国、特别是发展中国家人民自由发展其国家选举程序或企图篡改这些选举结果的行动都违反《联合国宪章》和国际法准则。
    大会呼吁各国不要直接或间接地为别国的政治党派或团体提供资金或提供其他形式的公开或秘密的支持。
    大会还谴责对其它国家人民、当选政府或其合法领导人使用武力或进行武力威胁的行为。
    今天的大会还通过了另一项关于选举问题的决议，强调“国际社会每一个成员都有义务尊重其它国家在自由选择和发展其选举制度方面所做的决定”。
    这项决议草案是11月下旬在联大三委会议上经过一番斗争后才定稿的。会上美国等24国首先提出一项草案，企图把西方的选举模式强加于其它国家，中国等10国提出了一项修正案，强调各国有权选择自己的选举制度，此修正意见为与会各国代表所接受。
