The first chill of winter in December has brought a fragrant gift from Yichang, Hubei Province, to Shanghai: navel oranges, tangerines, and seedless mandarins. These citrus fruits have added a delightful aroma to Shanghai's already abundant fruit market.

With the help of Premier Li Peng, the first batch of 69,000 kilograms of citrus fruits from Yichang arrived in Shanghai on the evening of December 2. By midnight, all the fruits had been distributed to 12 wholesale markets across six districts in the city. By the morning of December 6, all the fruits had been sold.

This year, Yichang produced a bumper crop of citrus fruits, totaling 135 million kilograms. However, due to difficulties in external sales channels, the fruits faced challenges in reaching the market. Premier Li Peng took notice of this situation and showed great concern.

Shanghai, sharing the same Yangtze River, extended a warm hand. Despite the market already being saturated with citrus fruits, various departments in Shanghai worked diligently to secure sales channels and decided to waive market service fees.

According to the Hubei Provincial Office in Shanghai, Shanghai is the first domestic region to help Yichang solve the problem of citrus fruit sales.

It is also known that the three varieties of citrus fruits brought to Shanghai this time are of high quality and have been well-received by Shanghai consumers. The second batch of citrus fruits is expected to arrive in Shanghai before the New Year.

    总理的关注有了结果
    宜昌柑桔在沪受欢迎
    新华社上海12月9日电　（记者厉正宏）朔风初起的12月，来自湖北宜昌的脐橙、锦橙和无核桔，又为上海丰足的果品市场增飘几许柑馨桔香。
    经李鹏总理牵线搭桥，湖北省宜昌地区首批销往上海的6.9万公斤柑桔，12月2日晚到达上海。当晚，上海有关部门立即安排接货、调度，至3日凌晨2点，所有柑桔分运到全市6个区12个水果批发交易市场，6日上午已批发销售完毕。
    今年宜昌地区柑桔特大丰收，总产量达1.35亿公斤，但由于外销渠道不畅，销售出现困难。李鹏总理知情后十分关注。
    共饮一江之水的上海市伸出了热情的双手，在上海市场柑桔货源已趋饱和的情况下，市各有关部门积极工作，多方联系和安排落实销售渠道，并决定免收市场服务费。
    据湖北省驻上海办事处介绍，上海市是国内第一个帮助湖北宜昌突击解决柑桔销售困难的地区。
    另据了解，这次来沪的3个柑桔品种质量优良，受到上海消费者欢迎。第二批柑桔将于新年前后顺江而下，陆续来上海。
