Title: A Good Life Comes from Struggle, Not Fate

Recently, I noticed that the majority of buyers of astrology books at bookstalls are young people. Similarly, most of those who seek fortune-telling services in city streets and alleys are also young people. Some people refer to this phenomenon as "youth astrology fever." I have observed the questions young people ask fortune-tellers and have conversed with some of them at fortune-telling stalls. I found that these young people have various psychological states.

The psychological state of intertwined hope and despair. Since the reform and opening up, with the implementation of various reform policies, the living and behavioral space for young people has become much broader compared to the past. Hope has increased, and the allure of hope has strengthened, but the possibility and potential for hope to be shattered always coexist with hope itself. Therefore, while young people pursue a hope, they also bear the psychological burden of disappointment. Whether what awaits them is the realization of hope or the shattering of hope, many people are uncertain and feel lost. Thus, they turn to fortune-tellers for guidance. A recent university graduate, dissatisfied with his job assignment, wanted to go to Hainan to seek his fortune. But what awaits him in Hainan? He did not seek advice from the organization, leaders, or relatives, but instead, he rashly handed over the decision-making power to a fortune-teller.

The psychological state of intertwined opportunity and uncertainty. In Ankang, Shaanxi, near the train station, a young villager was asking a fortune-teller if he could make money by raising mink. He said: he had raised long-haired rabbits in the past. Initially, the rabbit fur was very expensive, but by the time he had raised them, the fur was no longer exported, and the price had dropped, causing him to lose several thousand yuan. His words convey the information that with the development of the socialist market economy, opportunities for young people have increased; but due to the laws of the market economy, the uncertainty in social life has also increased. In the initial stage of the development of the socialist market economy, especially in relatively remote rural areas, there is a lack of information, guidance, and consultation, making this uncertainty even more severe. Those who go out to make money or work seek fortune-telling, essentially hoping that the fortune-teller can reduce their psychological uncertainty in seeking opportunities.

The psychological state of intertwined subjective confidence and objective uncertainty. Among those who seek fortune-telling, there are many young cadres. They mostly ask about their "future." A cadre in his early thirties, who is shrewd and capable, said: "If promotions for cadres were based solely on ability and performance, then I would just focus on my work. But now the relationships are complex, and who knows what will happen in the future. Actually, I don't believe in fate, but I see that some people have such good luck, so I come to try it out."

The psychological state of intertwined desire for success and hope for luck. Of course, there are also some young people who, seeing others seize opportunities and achieve success, are inspired with a desire for success. But they either lack the basic qualities of successful people or the courage of successful people. Knowing that they lack certain conditions for success, but unwilling to admit defeat, and also not prepared to make efforts to strive for success, they come to the fortune-telling stall, hoping that the fortune-teller will point out a shortcut.

From my observations, among the young people who seek fortune-telling, few truly believe in it. They just want to use the fortune-teller's words to strengthen a certain hope in their hearts. This reflects that the development of the socialist market economy has brought psychological restlessness and anxiety to people, especially young people. If there is a lack of patient and detailed ideological and political work, and a lack of serious education, they will turn to fatalism. Superstitions such as astrology and fortune-telling are taking advantage of this social psychological climate to resurge. Therefore, to eliminate this astrology fever, it is first necessary to confiscate astrology books and ban fortune-telling stalls. But this is not enough. Currently, on the one hand, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the construction of clean government and improve party discipline to eliminate some of the objective causes that young people cannot understand and can only attribute to fate. On the other hand, while strengthening Marxist education for young people and establishing a materialist worldview, schools, organizations, enterprises, and rural party and youth league organizations should work together to enthusiastically help them solve difficulties and problems in their lives, studies, work, and career development. They should do a good job of their ideological and political work and, through strong and effective ideological and political work, fundamentally improve the political and ideological level and psychological quality of young people.

    美好的人生靠奋斗  不靠生相
    ——对一些青年人热心算命的透视
    前一段时间我发现，书摊上“星相”书刊的买者大都是年轻人；在城市街头巷尾听人算命的也仍然是青年人居多。有人把这种现象称为“青年星相热”。我曾注意过青年人向算命先生询问的内容，也同一些算命摊前的青年进行过交谈，我发现算命青年有以下各种心理。
    希望和担心希望破灭交织的心理。改革开放以来，随着各种改革政策的施行，青年人的生存空间和行为空间较前广阔。希望增加，希望的诱惑加强，而希望破灭的可能性和潜在性总是同希望本身同生共存。因此，青年人在追求一份希望的同时也就在心理上承担了一份失望的负载。等待他们的是希望的实现还是希望的破灭，许多人无法确定，感到茫然，于是他们便去请教算命先生。一位刚毕业的大学生，因对毕业分配不满意，想出走海南闯天下。但海南会有什么等待着他？他没有找组织、没有找领导和亲友，却把抉择权轻率地给了算命先生。
    机会和不确定感交织的心理。在陕西安康市的火车站旁，一位农村青年正请一位算命先生算算他养貂能否赚钱。他说：他前些年养长毛兔，开始时，兔毛很贵，待他养成，兔毛不出口了，价钱跌下来，一下亏了好几千元。他的话透出的信息是：随着社会主义商品经济的发展，对年轻人来说，机会多了；但由于商品经济规律的作用，社会生活的不确定感也增加了。而在社会主义商品经济刚刚发展的初始阶段，对于较为偏僻地区的农村，缺少信息、缺少指导和咨询，这种不确定感更为严重。那些出外挣钱、做工的人去算命，实际上也是需要通过算命先生在心理上来减少他们寻求机会的盲目性。
    主观自信和客观无法把握交织的心理。算命者中有不少年轻干部。他们算的大都是“前程”。一位30岁出头，精明强干的干部说：“如果用干部都凭本事、凭实绩，那我只管干就是了。可现在关系复杂，以后怎样可说不来。其实我也不信命，只是看到有的人命运太好，于是我也来算算玩儿。”
    成功欲望和希图侥幸交织的心理。当然，也有一些年轻人，看到别人抓住机会取得了成功，也激起了成功的欲望。但他们或者缺少成功者的基本素质，或者缺少成功者的胆识。明知自己缺少某种成功的条件，又不甘心自认，但也不准备去做争取成功的努力，于是来到算命摊前，希图算命先生指出一条捷径。
    据我观察，去算命的年轻人中，真信的恐怕并不多。他们不过是想通过算命先生的口来强化某种心里的希望而已。这反映出社会主义商品经济的发展，已带给人们特别是给青年人带来心理上的躁动与不安。如果对他们缺乏耐心细致的思想政治工作，缺乏认真的教育，他们就会求教于宿命论。诸如星相、算命等封建迷信正是借助这种社会心理的气候而死灰复燃。因此，要消除这种星相热，首先要收缴星相书刊，取缔算命摊。但仅此是不够的。当前，一方面要继续加强廉政建设，搞好党风，消除一些青年人无法归结，便只好归结为命运的客观原因；另一方面，在对青年加强马克思主义教育，树立唯物主义世界观的同时，学校、机关、企业和农村党团组织要一起动手，热情帮助他们解决在生活、学习、工作和事业发展等方面遇到的困难和问题，做好他们的思想政治工作，并通过坚强有力的思想政治工作，从根本上提高青年人的政治思想水平和心理素质。
