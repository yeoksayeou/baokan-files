	Strive for Excellence Through Rigorous Training
	– Chronicle of the "Model Company for Grassroots Construction" in the Jinan Military Region

	On the battlefield of Laoshan, there was a fierce battle that swept through like a storm: The artillery's continuous fire, the assault troops trampling through the red soil churned up by the cannons, covering each other, advancing beyond the attack, and in an instant, they captured the enemy's fortified frontline hill and main position, annihilating the invading enemy.

	The unit that undertook the assault mission was the "Double Meritorious Seventh Company," which was recently named the "Model Company for Grassroots Construction" by the Jinan Military Region.

	I
	When new recruits are assigned to the Seventh Company, the company always conducts three months of special intensive training. The purpose is to train the body and willpower. To strengthen the soldiers' abdominal muscles, the Seventh Company removes the footrests from the double-decker beds, and the soldiers must use both hands to grasp the bed frame to practice a few beautiful swan dives when getting on and off the bed; to ensure that kneeling shooting is more stable, for a period of time, the officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company all eat with one leg kneeling on the ground; to endure the armed cross-country run, the new recruits of the Seventh Company all carry a backpack strap when they go out for training, and if they really can't run, they tie it around their waist and let others pull them along; as for climbing mountains and going downhill, the soldiers of the Seventh Company always use the backpack strap to tie their legs together, "frog-jumping" up the mountain and rolling down the hill; there are also unique training methods such as punching sandbags and chopping trees with one palm.

	Vice Chief of the General Staff Han Huizhi, who is famous for his strict training, once watched the Seventh Company's tactical training and repeatedly praised it as "good," saying they are "all little tigers." As for drill training, the new recruits of the Seventh Company must go through "three months and a half year" until they can withstand the wind without tears and sand without being blinded, walk like a tiger, and stand like a pine tree, before they are considered to have passed the "entry-level test." Not long ago, a military outstanding drill instructor who created the only "Cao's Step" in China was invited to the Seventh Company for assessment. After watching a platoon's formation transformation, he exclaimed, "This company's drill training has skills."

	II
	When it comes to discipline and training, the Seventh Company has many stories of "only one person" or "only moving once."

	Last summer, a large factory in the garrison area invited the unit where the Seventh Company is located to participate in a celebration. The heat was like fire, and the venue was like a steamer. The officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company, as usual, stood with their chests out, backs straight, and eyes forward. The workers watched their uniforms slowly become soaked with sweat, and then salt crystals appeared.

	With a command, Company Commander Sun Zhaogun led the entire company directly to the training ground and sat upright in the sun for four hours. The factory director and secretary rushed over to apologize to Commander Sun, saying, "The meeting has already ended, and moreover, only one soldier ate an ice cream given by a worker..." Commander Sun said, "The meeting is over, but the Seventh Company's duty officer has not given the order. At this time, if one person moves even a little, the Seventh Company's unity and discipline will be lost."

	The company did not criticize that soldier, but this four-hour sun "retraining" made another batch of new recruits in the Seventh Company realize that the Seventh Company's discipline and style are indeed as tough as steel.

	The Seventh Company's discipline and style are truly based on self-awareness. Once, after a full-regiment meeting, the deputy regiment commander commented, "The Seventh Company's formation is the best, but unfortunately, only one person moved." Back in the camp, after the dispersal order was given, no one from the platoon leader to the new recruits left. They asked each other, "Who moved today?" At this time, Company Commander Xuan Yuhe walked over with his head down and said, "Don't check anymore, it was me." Saying this, he untied his belt, revealing a hemorrhoid the size of a tea cup on his buttocks, with pus and blood sticking his shorts together. The new recruits were speechless, and the old soldiers also fell silent.

	III
	The officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company have a slogan, "Competition is the Seventh Company's show." At the end of last year, the army corps where the Seventh Company is located decided to hold a competition. When the news came out, the officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company voluntarily stopped their leave and intensified their training.

	The first event was a written test, and the Seventh Company easily took first place among many strong competitors. Next was the grenade throwing competition. Company Commander Sun Zhaogun, who had seven shrapnel fragments in his body, threw 58 meters. A platoon leader was a college graduate, thin and gentle, and had thrown the farthest 45 meters in the company. As soon as he stepped onto the platform, he threw 49.8 meters. The morale of the Seventh Company's officers and soldiers soared, and even the new recruits, with a total evaluation of 49.5 meters, took first place again. A night of wind and snow, the obstacles on the field, such as the single log bridge and the high wall, were frozen and covered with snow, slipperier than if they had been oiled. When the Seventh Company tried to jump, five or six people went up and were all thrown down. The officers and soldiers were anxious, "The first place is definitely the Seventh Company today!" Platoon Leader Xu Changfu had a sprained ankle, swollen like an eggplant, and fell off the single log bridge three times, but he got up and rushed, and the last section of the road he simply crawled towards the finish line. Seeing all this, the army corps commander shouted, "The first place is not given to such a company!" Indeed, the Seventh Company won the army corps' banner with the first place in total points, deservedly.

	And since 1976, the Seventh Company has won such first places 365 times.

	New soldier Ding Sibaobao was assigned to the Seventh Company for only a few days when the public security bureau from his hometown chased him to the company. He had made a homemade gun and fought in a brawl, punching in someone's nose.

	But Company Commander Zhang Fengyang intervened and "saved" him. "Since you've come to my Seventh Company, even a stubborn stone will be polished into iron."

	However, this act of saving did not move Ding Sibaobao. On the third day at noon, he punched the cook in the face. The company commander did not criticize him but immediately called all the platoon and squad leaders, "If you can defeat any one of them, the Seventh Company will be considered defeated by you." The company commander said. Ding Sibaobao punched straight at the squad leader Xuan Kuihua, whom he thought was the weakest. Unexpectedly, the other did not retaliate, but the one who fell was the 1.81-meter-tall Ding Sibaobao. Ding Sibaobao was convinced, and with ideological education, he became a squad leader the second year. At the end of the year, he was recommended to participate in the whole military physical fitness standard competition. In a few years, he led more than ten soldiers to become backbone members, and he was awarded two second-class meritorious service medals and was named a "National New Long March Pioneer" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    刻苦训练　勇夺第一
    ——济南军区“基层建设模范连”纪事
    新华社通讯员　靳士考　新华社记者　谭道博
    在老山战场，曾有这么一次风卷残云般的战斗：追逐火炮的延伸射击，突击队员们趟开炮火犁翻的红土，相互掩护，超越攻击前进，转眼间，就攻下敌坚固设防的前沿高地和敌主阵地，全歼入侵之敌。
    担任突击任务的，就是最近被济南军区命名为“基层建设模范连”的“双大功七连”。
    一
    新兵分到七连，连队总是先有3个月独特的强化训练。目的是练身体和意志。为了增强战士的腹肌，七连拆掉双层床上的踏脚架，战士上床下床都必须双手反握床架，练几遍漂亮的鸽子翻身；为了保证跪姿射击更稳固，一段时间内七连官兵吃饭时都单腿跪地支着身躯；为了苦练武装越野，七连新兵出操都带上背包绳，实在跑不动就往腰部一系，让别人拉着跑；至于爬山下坡，七连的兵从来都是用背包带把双腿一捆，往山顶“蛙跳”，往山下滚翻；还有拳击沙袋、单掌劈树等独特的训练。
    以练兵严格而著名的副总参谋长韩怀智，一次看过七连的战术训练，连声赞“好”，夸他们“个个都是小老虎”。而队列训练，七连的新兵都是要经过“仨月半年”直到风吹不流泪，沙打不迷眼，行如虎步，立如山松，才算是过了“入门关”。不久前，一位创造了中国唯一“曹氏步伐”的全军优秀队列教员，应“邀”来七连考核。看完一个班的队型转换，惊叹“这个连的队列训练有功夫”。
    二
    说起作风纪律训练，七连可是有许多“只一个人”或“只动了一下”的故事。
    前年夏天驻地一家大工厂邀请七连所在部队去参加庆祝会。天热得像下火一般，会场里犹如蒸笼。七连官兵像往常一样，一个个挺胸直腰圆目前视，职工们看着他们的军衣，一片片慢慢湿透，又一块块泛起盐花。
    一声令下，连长孙兆群把全连径直带到操场上，又在烈日下整整端坐了四个小时。厂长、书记赶来为此向孙连长致歉，说：“已经散会了，而且就一个战士吃了一支职工送给的冰糕……”孙连长说：“会是散了，可七连值班员没有口令。这时候一个人哪怕只动了一下，也就没有七连的整齐统一”。
    连队丝毫没有批评那个战士，但这次四小时的烈日“补训”，却使七连又一茬新兵意识到，七连的作风纪律真是如钢似铁。
    七连的纪律作风又真正是以自觉为基础的。一次全团集会结束，副团长讲评说：“七连的方队最好，遗憾的是只有一个人动了一下。”回到营区，解散口令下过，从排长到新兵谁也不离开。他们互相问：今天是谁动了这一下？这时，连长冉玉和低着头走来，说：“别查了，是我。”说着解开裤带，露出屁股上一个茶碗大的痔疮，脓血已把短裤粘成一片。新兵无语，老兵也不再吱声了。
    三
    七连官兵们有一句“比武就是七连的节目”的口号。去年底，七连所在的集团军决定进行一次比武，消息传出，七连官兵就自行停止休假并加紧训练。
    第一场比“文”，七连在众多强手中先轻取第一。接着比赛投弹，连长孙兆群身藏7块弹片，上来58米。一排长是个大学毕业生，瘦弱文静，在连里最多投过45米，一上擂台，出手49.8米。七连官兵的士气一下子高不可遏，连新兵在内总评49.5米，又夺第一。一夜风雪，障碍场上的独木桥、高板墙冰封雪裹，比抹了油还滑。试跳时七连上去五六个人，都被摔了下来。官兵一急：“第一七连今天拿定了！”班长许长福脚踝扭伤，肿得像紫茄子，先后从独木桥上摔下来3次，爬起来还是冲，最后一段路干脆就爬着冲向终点线。看着这一切，集团军参谋长高声叫道：“第一不给这样的连队给谁？”果然，七连以总分第一的战绩，当之无愧地扛回了集团军的锦旗。
    而从1976年来，七连仅这样的第一，就夺来365次。
    新战士丁四宝刚分到七连没几天，家乡公安局的人就追到连队。他曾自制火枪打群架，一拳打塌了对方的鼻子。
    但七连长张风洋却出面把他“保”了下来。“既然进了我七连的门，是块顽石也会让他去渣成铁的。”
    可这保救之恩没有感化丁四宝，第三天中午，他又一拳打在炊事班长的脸上。连长没有批评他，当即找来所有的班、排长，“你如果随便赢得哪一个，七连就算让你打服了。”连长说。丁四宝挥拳直取自认为最弱的排长展奎华。不料对方未还手，倒下的却是一米八一的丁四宝。丁四宝折服了，加上思想教育，第二年他当上了班长。年底被推荐参加全军军体达标赛。几年里他带的兵有十几人成了骨干，他也两次荣立二等功，被团中央命名为“全国新长征突击手”。
