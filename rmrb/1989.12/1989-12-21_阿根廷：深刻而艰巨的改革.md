In July, the Argentine government led by President Menem took office, marking the first time in 13 years that the Justicialist Party returned to the Pink House (the presidential palace). This is also the government with the least Peronist traditions within the Justicialist Party. Amid significant changes in domestic and international situations, President Menem introduced a comprehensive set of new policies, undertaking sweeping reforms that have drawn global attention.

The Menem government took over the reins of power five months earlier than scheduled from the Radical Party, which had lost control of the situation. At that time, the monthly inflation rate was nearly 200%, production and commercial activities were disrupted, the central bank's foreign exchange reserves were almost depleted, and interest on foreign debt had been overdue for a year. Panic spread across the nation. The immediate task was to quickly curb the runaway inflation, stabilize the market, and calm public sentiment. After taking office, the new government decisively implemented a series of stringent adjustment measures, significantly raising and then freezing public utility fees, the dollar exchange rate, and wages, while reaching an agreement with the business sector to freeze prices for three months. The Menem government aims to fundamentally reform the national economic structure. Recently, the government submitted two bills to Congress: the National Reform Law and the Economic Emergency Law. The core of the National Reform Law is the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Except for a few key sectors like water and electricity supply, the state will withdraw from all direct production and service sectors, minimizing government intervention in economic life and allowing the market to play a regulatory role. The main content of the Economic Emergency Law is the abolition of all state subsidies for production and consumption. After these two bills are passed, the government will submit the Tax Reform Law and a draft of the new Labor Law. Tax reform mainly involves simplifying tax categories, lowering tax rates, and expanding the tax base to plug tax evasion loopholes. The new Labor Law includes unemployment insurance and shortens the statutory labor contract period. The government has also issued a series of decrees to ease import restrictions, remove restrictions on foreign investment, and activate the stock market, among other measures. The speed at which these major policies have been introduced and the government's determination to implement them are unprecedented.

When forming the government, Menem appointed a few close party members and recruited a large number of outsiders, many of whom held liberal economic views that were previously opposed to the Justicialist Party. President Menem also issued an amnesty order, pardoning military personnel convicted or under trial for human rights violations and those involved in several coups, while also pardoning fugitive former guerrilla leaders, hoping to achieve national reconciliation and focus on reform. The new Argentine government has also adjusted its foreign policy. Menem proposed that Argentine diplomacy should not be restricted by any ideological borders. Most notably, Argentina took the initiative to improve relations with Britain, clearing obstacles to cooperation with the European Community.

The Menem government has been in office for over four months and has achieved significant results in stabilizing the economy. Hyperinflation has been curbed, with the inflation rate dropping to 5.6% in October, the central bank's foreign exchange reserves increasing to over $10 billion, and the national budget showing a slight surplus. Economic order has been largely restored, but promoting comprehensive economic reform still faces strong resistance.

The Justicialist Party has always advocated for social welfare and fair distribution as its banner. However, this term's Justicialist Party government is implementing economic policies with a strong neoliberal flavor. President Menem proposed to establish a mass market economy. Therefore, while receiving praise from liberals, the government's policies have made many within the Justicialist Party unhappy, with some openly criticizing Menem for deviating from Peronist traditions. In particular, unions are dissatisfied with the government's restrictions on wage increases, and the General Confederation of Labor is uncooperative with the government's economic plan. The private business sector generally approves of the government's economic policies. However, privatization, the abolition of subsidies, increased taxation, and eased import restrictions also infringe on the interests of certain privileged classes and groups; they exert pressure on the government by manipulating the black market dollar exchange rate. Four months into the new government's term, due to intensified labor-management conflicts and rising dollar exchange rates, signs of social unrest have reemerged. The government's economic plan faces a severe test.

President Menem emphasized at the outset of his term that the government's economic plan is a long-term policy. In the face of various opposing views and pressures, the government has shown its determination to stick to the established course. For Argentines, 1989 was a year of despair and hope intertwined. Whether the 1990s can become a turning point depends on the success or failure of the economic plan.

    阿根廷：深刻而艰巨的改革
    本报记者　李志明
    今年7月，阿根廷以梅内姆总统为首的政府宣誓就职，这是时隔13年之后正义党第一次重返玫瑰宫（总统府），同时这也是庇隆主义传统色彩最少的一届正义党政府。在国内形势、国际环境发生巨大变化的情况下，梅内姆总统推出了一整套新政，大刀阔斧地进行改革，举世瞩目。
    梅内姆政府比法定时间提前5个月从无力控制局势的激进党手中接过政权。当时，通货膨胀月率将近200％，生产和商业活动无法正常进行，中央银行外汇存底几乎为零，外债利息已拖欠一年之久，恐慌情绪笼罩全国。当务之急是迅速遏制恶性通货膨胀，稳定市场，安定人心。新政府上任后果断地采取了一系列严厉的调整措施，将公用事业收费、美元汇率和工资大幅度调高后冻结，并与企业界达成了冻结物价3个月的协议。梅内姆政府的目标是对国家经济结构进行根本性的改革。前不久，政府向议会提交了国家改革法和经济紧急状态法两个法案。国家改革法的核心是国营企业私有化，除了少数关键部门如水电供应外，国家退出所有直接生产和服务领域，尽可能减少国家对经济生活的干预，让市场发挥调节作用。经济紧急状态法主要内容是取消国家对生产和消费的一切补贴。这两个法案通过后，政府接着提交了税制改革法和新的劳工法草案。税利改革主要是简化税目，降低税率，同时扩大课税面，堵塞逃税。新的劳工法规定了失业保险，缩短法定劳动合同期限。政府还颁布了一系列法令，放宽进口限制，取消对外资的限制，活跃股票市场等等。这一连串的重大政策出台之快，政府实施的决心之大，都是前所未有的。
    在组成政府班子时，梅内姆除了任命少数党内亲密合作者外，任用了大批党外人士，其中很多是过去与正义党政见相反的持自由派经济观点的人。梅内姆总统还颁布赦免令，赦免了因侵犯人权罪被判刑或受审的军人和参与几次兵变的军人，同时赦免了被通缉的前游击队领导人，希望以此实现全国和解，集中力量进行改革。阿根廷新政府对外交政策也作了调整。梅内姆提出阿根廷外交不受任何意识形态边疆的限制。最突出的是阿根廷采取主动，改善了与英国的关系，扫清了同欧共体合作的障碍。
    梅内姆政府就任4个多月，在稳定经济方面取得了显著的成绩。恶性通货膨胀被制止，10月份通膨率已下降到5.6％，中央银行外汇储备增加到10多亿美元，国家财政收支略有盈余，经济秩序基本恢复，但推动全面经济改革仍遇到强大阻力。
    正义党历来以注重社会福利，主张公平分配为旗帜。而本届正义党政府推行的经济政策带有鲜明的新自由主义色彩，梅内姆总统提出要建立大众的市场经济。因此，在得到自由派赞许的同时，政府的路线方针使正义党内部不少人感到不快，有的人公开批评梅内姆背离了庇隆主义的传统学说。特别是工会对限制工资增长幅度不满，总工会对政府的经济计划抱不合作态度。私人企业界一般对政府的经济政策是满意的。但是私有化和取消补贴、增税、放宽进口等也侵犯了某些既得利益阶层和集团的利益；他们通过操纵黑市美元汇率上升对政府施加压力。新政府执政4个月后，由于劳资冲突加剧、美元汇率上扬，社会上又出现了情绪不安的苗头。政府的经济计划面临严峻考验。
    梅内姆总统就职之初就强调，政府经济计划是一项长远政策，鉴于现实的重重困难，面对各种反对意见和压力，政府表明了坚决实行既定方针的决心。对阿根廷人来说，1989年是绝望与希望交织的一年。即将开始的90年代能否成为转折的起点，经济计划的成败是关键。
