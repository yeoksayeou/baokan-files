To prevent the defeated rebel forces from regrouping and attempting another coup, the Philippine Department of National Defense has ordered the military in Manila to be on high alert.

The chief of staff of the Capital Region Defense Command, Jesus Lanho, said today that during the Christmas period, 85% of the military in the Manila area will be on high alert, while 15% will be allowed to take leave.

Lanho pointed out that although the rebel forces, which are currently in hiding, have lost the ability to launch large-scale attacks, they still have the capability to carry out terrorist activities, such as selectively assassinating government and military leaders and blowing up certain facilities. Therefore, they must be dealt with seriously.

Currently, all military camps in Manila, especially the headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines located at Camp Aguinaldo, have heightened security.

Meanwhile, the Chief of Staff of the Philippine Armed Forces, De Villa, said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency that he believes the coup leaders, including Honasan, are currently hiding in the northern part of Luzon Island in the Philippines.

    防止被挫败叛军再次兵变
    菲律宾首都驻军进入一级战备状态
    新华社马尼拉12月20日电  由于被挫败的反政府军事政变的叛军可能再次集结力量试图发动一次新的兵变，菲律宾国防部已命令马尼拉的军队处于一级战备状态。
    菲律宾首都地区防卫司令部参谋长赫苏斯·兰霍今天在此间说，在圣诞节期间，马尼拉地区除15％的军队允许度假外，85％的军队将处于一级战备状态。
    兰霍指出，现在正四处躲藏的政变军虽然已经失去大规模攻击的能力，但是还有能力进行恐怖活动，比如有选择地暗杀一些政府和军方领导人，炸毁某些设施等，因此还必须认真对付。
    目前，马尼拉所有军营，特别是武装部队司令部所在地阿吉纳尔多军营都加强了警戒。
    与此同时，菲律宾武装部队总参谋长德贝利亚在接受菲律宾通讯社的采访时说，他相信政变领导人霍纳桑等人目前正躲藏在菲律宾北部的吕宋岛。
