Local officials must have a sense of national responsibility
— Observations from Jiayu County, Hubei Province

The prosperity of farmers in Jiayu County is renowned in Hubei Province. While the officials here are relatively clean, outsiders rarely know about it.

We discovered in Jiayu that the local people always link economic development with clean governance. They dislike both poverty with clean officials and wealth with corrupt officials. They prefer wealth with clean officials. This "clean" not only means being honest but also having a clear mind and far-sighted vision.

The cadres in Jiayu adhere to this standard of "clean officials" set by the people. They say, "The less personal gain we seek, the more authority we have to speak."

To understand how determined Jiayu County's party and government organs are to promote clean governance, we need to start with a significant family planning case that shook the entire county.

The population of Jiayu County was 139,000 in 1949 and 273,000 in 1978, nearly doubling. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Jiayu County Committee believed that controlling the population depended on whether cadres and party members could take the lead. Indeed, with cadres leading and effective measures in place, the long-standing trend of high population growth rates was reversed, dropping to 6.58 per thousand in 1984. However, in 1985, a young and capable deputy county magistrate had a second child beyond the plan, causing a stir throughout the county. The county committee and the county disciplinary committee were fully aware that many who wanted a second child were watching closely how the county would handle this matter. If they showed even a hint of leniency, the county committee's long-standing reputation in family planning would be ruined. The county committee decided to remove the deputy county magistrate from his party position and, with the approval of the county people's congress, also removed him from his deputy county magistrate position, recommending he be transferred to the city suburb town as a deputy town magistrate.

This "tearful execution of justice" had a significant impact on Jiayu's anti-corruption efforts. Since 1986, there have been no cases of over-quota births, illegal construction of private homes, or illegal conversion from rural to urban residency among the current county-level leading cadres. Over the past decade, farmers in the entire county have updated their homes twice, while the main departments of the county committee's offices still work in the old flat-roofed buildings from the 1950s and 1960s, content to be servants of the people.

"Five children not entering the imperial examination, but doing everything efficiently," is the private praise for those officials with integrity. The current county committee secretary, Liu Yanhua, says: The people's expectations of us are to lead them to achieve their goals. Over the years, our county committees have been striving towards this goal.

Liu Yanhua's words can be seen in Jiayu's afforestation efforts.

Afforestation is a long-term project for "planting trees for future generations." The ruling officials of Jiayu saw that afforestation was a fundamental decision to enrich the people of Jiayu, so since 1981, four county committee secretaries and county magistrates have persistently promoted afforestation, increasing the forest coverage rate from 8.4% to 26.38% in eight years, earning the title of "Advanced County in Plain Afforestation" from the Forestry Department.

At the end of the 1970s, this county did not know about the fast-growing and high-yielding Italian poplar suitable for plains. Now, the vast plains here are almost dominated by "Italian poplar." The first county committee secretary of the 1980s, Bai Dengkun, was the person who introduced the Italian poplar. After investigation and verification and signing a contract with the Forestry Department, he decided to create 80,000 mu of Italian poplar within ten years. He led forestry officials to plant the first 450 mu of Italian poplar in the county and soon passed the afforestation baton to the second county committee secretary, Xu Kecheng. Xu Kecheng implemented the blueprint set by Bai Dengkun and the people of Jiayu item by item. When his term ended after three years, the first phase of 40,000 mu of Italian poplar was successfully completed. The third county committee secretary, Zhou Shiji, took over and began the second phase of the Italian poplar project, considering how to turn the soon-to-be-mature Italian poplar into a real money tree for the people of Jiayu, proposing the idea of building the first Italian poplar artificial board factory in the country. Later, he passed the baton to the current fourth county committee secretary, Liu Yanhua.

Jiayu's afforestation is like a relay race. Now, Jiayu has planted 67,000 mu of continuous fast-growing and high-yielding Italian poplar, including field forest networks and around houses, totaling over 100,000 mu of Italian poplar. Currently, Liu Yanhua and County Magistrate Chen Yansheng are overseeing the construction of a 30 million yuan artificial board factory, which is expected to be operational by the end of next year.

People have done the math: just from Italian poplar, Jiayu farmers can stably earn over 100 yuan per person per year.

Currently, there is a type of local official who enriches their own area but has a poor reputation elsewhere. The officials of Jiayu County believe that such local officials, who only care about local interests, even if they have no illegal money in their pockets, are not truly clean public servants. Their character is particularly evident in leading the people of Jiayu to produce more grain and sell more grain for the country.

From Jiayu to Wuhan, it is less than 90 kilometers. In the eyes of some, places close to big markets are usually commercially prosperous, agriculturally declining, and grain supply unstable. But what the reporter saw in Jiayu was a different scene. Ten years ago, Jiayu's total grain production was only 250 million jin, but by last year, it had steadily increased to 372 million jin, with an annual net increase of 100 million jin. This year's situation is even better, with grain piles everywhere, early rice harvested and stored, and late rice harvest in sight. According to experts' estimates, this year's total production of 385 million jin is stable, and the commercial grain provided to society will exceed last year's level of 700 jin per capita in rural areas. In other words, the 210,000 farmers in Jiayu provide enough commercial grain for 300,000 urban residents for a year. Thinking of the country when planting grain is just a common example of Jiayu's local officials having a sense of the bigger picture. They say, local officials bear the responsibility of two benefits: one for the country and one for the locality. Only focusing on one benefit will ultimately result in losing both. Now, the sense of the bigger picture and national responsibility has become an important part of this county's anti-corruption efforts from top to bottom.

### “地方官”要有国家观念——湖北省嘉鱼县见闻

    “地方官”要有国家观念
    ——湖北省嘉鱼县见闻
    新华社记者　周东爱　徐士杰
    嘉鱼县农民的富，在湖北省农村是出了名的。而这里的官比较清廉，县外人却鲜为人知。
    我们在嘉鱼发现，这里的老百姓总是把经济发展和为政清廉联系起来看，民穷官清，他们不喜欢；民富而官不清，他们也说三道四；他们喜欢的是民富官清，这个“清”，不光是两袖清风，还包括头脑清醒，目光远大。
    嘉鱼的干部，就是按老百姓这个“官清”的要求来约束自己的。他们说：“少谋一分私利，就多一分发言权”。
    要说嘉鱼县的党政机关兴廉的决心有多大，这得从一场轰动全县的计划生育案说起。
    嘉鱼县人口1949年是13.9万人，1978年是27.3万人，接近翻了一番。党的十一届三中全会以后，中共嘉鱼县委认为，要控制人口，关键要看干部、党员能不能带头。说来也真灵，干部带头加措施对头，硬是把多年来人口年增长率居高不下的势头扭转过来，1984年还降到了千分之六点五八。然而在1985年，一位年轻有为的副县长超计划生了第二胎，为此闹得满城风雨。县委和县纪委都深知，许多想生第二胎的人都在睁大眼睛看着县里对这件事情的裁决，只要稍徇一分私，县委在计划生育工作上多年形成的威望就会损失殆尽。县委决定给予这位副县长撤销党内职务的处分外，并报请县人大批准撤销其副县长职务，建议调任县城关镇作副镇长。
    这场“挥泪斩马?”的戏对嘉鱼廉政建设的效应是巨大的。现职的县级主要领导干部从1986年以来没有“超生”的，没有违纪建私房的，也没有违纪“农转非”的。全县农民十多年来住房已普遍更新了两代，而县委机关主要部门今天仍甘居陋室，坚持在50年代、60年代盖的老平房办公，甘当人民的公仆。
    “五子不登科，干啥啥利索”，这是私下人们对那些一身正气的公仆们的赞语。现任的县委书记刘彦其说：人民对我们的期望是能带领人民实现奋斗目标，这些年，我们的几届县委都是朝着这个目标努力的。
    刘彦其的话可以在嘉鱼造林上得到印证。
    造林是“前人栽树、后人乘凉”的事业。嘉鱼的当政者看准了造林是为嘉鱼人扎富根的一项基本决策，于是，从1981年起，四届书记、县长锲而不舍抓造林，使全县森林覆盖率8年间由8.4％上升到26.38％，被林业部评为“平原绿化先进县”。
    70年代末，这个县还不知适宜于平原的速生丰产的意大利杨树——为何物，如今这里广阔的平原几乎成了“意杨”天下。80年代的第一任县委书记白登坤是“意杨”的引进人，是他经过考察验证和林业部签定合同，决心10年内营造意杨8万亩。他带领林业干部栽下全县第一片450亩意杨林不久，就把造林的担子交给了第二任书记许克胜。许克胜把白登坤和嘉鱼人定下的蓝图一项项付诸实施。3年任满时，4万亩意杨的第一期工程胜利实现。第三任县委书记周世极接手又着手意杨的第二期工程，并在植树同时开始考虑如何把即将成材的意杨变成嘉鱼人民真正的摇钱树，提出了兴建全国第一家意杨人造板厂的设想。随后，他又把手里的“接力棒”交给了现任的第四任书记刘彦其。
    嘉鱼县造林真有点像接力赛，如今嘉鱼已栽意杨连片速生丰产林6.7万亩，包括田间林网、房前屋后共有意杨10余万亩。目前，刘彦其和县长陈彦生主持兴建的投资3000万元的人造板厂正紧张施工，预计明年底可以投产。
    人们算了笔帐，仅意杨这一项嘉鱼农民人均每年就可稳拿100元以上。
    时下，有一种地方官治肥了本地，但在外地声望不佳。嘉鱼县的干部们认为那种胳膊肘只会朝地方利益上拐的地方官，那怕自己腰包里没有一分不义之财，也算不得真正清廉的公仆。他们的这种品格，在带领嘉鱼人民为国家多产粮、多卖粮上体现得尤为突出。
    从嘉鱼到武汉，不到90公里。在一些人看来，离大市场近的地方，多半是工商兴、农业衰、粮难稳。但记者在嘉鱼见闻所及却是另一番景象。十年前嘉鱼粮食总产仅有2.5亿斤，到去年就稳步上升到3.72亿斤，一年净增1000万斤。今年形势更好，一路上，村村谷草堆成山，早稻丰收归仓，晚稻丰收在望。据行家测算，今年3.85亿斤的总产稳拿，向社会提供的商品粮将超过去年全县农村人均700斤的水平。也就是说，嘉鱼21万农民一年提供的商品粮，足够城里30万人吃一年。种粮想国家，只是嘉鱼县的地方官们心中有大局的一个普通的例子。他们说，地方官挑的是两头利：一头是国家，一头是地方，只顾一头利，到头来会两头都失利。现在，大局观念、国家观念，已经列为这个县上上下下廉政建设的重要内容。
