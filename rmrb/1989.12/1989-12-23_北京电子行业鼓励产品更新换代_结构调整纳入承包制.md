Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22nd.

Product structure adjustment plans, which were previously considered "soft indicators" for enterprise evaluations, have recently been incorporated as "hard indicators" into the contract management responsibility system for enterprises in Beijing's electronics industry.

The Beijing Electronics Industry Office recently conducted a survey of over 100 enterprises under its jurisdiction and found that enterprises that prioritized product structure adjustments in the past few years are now in a better position, while those with single-product lines and no new product reserves are facing operational difficulties. To encourage enterprises to adjust their product structures, they have identified 31 key products, including flat-panel orthogonal remote-control color TVs, high-end series computers, voltage-regulating integrated circuits, slow-scan visual telephone sets, and car seat adjusters, as priority adjustment projects. These projects are included in the enterprise contract management responsibility system, with each item being evaluated and linked to the rewards and punishments of enterprise managers.

It is understood that once these 31 key projects achieve economies of scale, they can generate an additional output value of 1.5 billion yuan and earn 15 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Currently, 23 enterprises, including the Beijing Television Factory, Dongfeng Television Factory, and Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, have signed product structure adjustment task agreements with their superiors.

    北京电子行业鼓励产品更新换代
    结构调整纳入承包制
    新华社北京十二月二十二日电　（通讯员李俊歧、记者刘浦泉）一向是“软指标”考核的企业产品结构调整计划，新近在北京电子行业已被作为“硬指标”纳入企业的承包经营责任制。
    北京电子工业办公室最近在对所属一百多家企业调查时发现，前几年重视产品结构调整的企业，现在的日子就比较好过；而产品单一、又没有新产品储备的企业，则生产经营容易陷入困境。为了促使企业调整产品结构，他们把平面直角遥控彩电、高档系列计算机、稳压集成电路、慢扫描可视电话机、汽车座椅调节器等三十一个产品列为重点产品调整项目，分别纳入企业承包经营责任制，逐项进行考核，并与企业经营者的奖惩挂钩。
    据了解，这三十一个重点项目一旦形成规模经济后，将可新增产值十五亿元，创汇一千五百万美元。目前，北京电视机厂、东风电视机厂、北京广播器材厂等二十三个企业的领导已同上级签订了产品结构调整任务书。
