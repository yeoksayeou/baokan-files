Qingxu County's Qingyuan Town in Taiyuan City holds two traditional temple fairs each year. The one held on November 4 was particularly lively, with over 60 "big covered wagons" participating in the event.

The "big covered wagons" are composed of 46 grassroots units from the Taiyuan City Commercial Bureau system. They set up long rows of stalls along both sides of the road, stretching over a kilometer. The goods for sale include color televisions, washing machines, bicycles, shirts, cotton socks, matches, and more, with over 2,500 different items. Signs advertising "price cuts" and "guaranteed returns and exchanges" were everywhere, delighting many farmers.

At the hardware stall, shovel heads were in high demand. A middle-aged farmer bought two, chuckling as he walked away and said to his companion, "These things just have a bit of rust on the surface, three yuan fifty for one, what a bargain. Now we're building farmland water conservancy projects, and these are just what we need. Before, I had to spend six or seven yuan for one."

A farm woman stopped in front of the discounted checkered shirts. The salesperson smiled and explained, "City people these days prefer new styles, so these shirts don't sell well in the city. But at seven yuan fifty each, they're such a bargain. They're perfect for farm work." The woman nodded in agreement and took out her wallet.

Many high-end consumer goods were sold at wholesale prices, attracting numerous customers. Televisions, washing machines, and brand-name bicycles were particularly popular. The abundance of goods and enthusiastic service truly opened the eyes of many farmers who rarely leave their villages. An elderly man in his sixties walked around the stalls, praising the "goods delivered to the countryside" without end: "In the past, we rural people were afraid of the 'cold faces' in the shops. Now, the salespeople from the provincial capital are so enthusiastic, even offering returns and exchanges for discounted items. It's really not common to see."

The goods delivery to the countryside lasted for three days. Over 300 employees from the Taiyuan City Commercial Bureau system braved the cold, working from early morning to late evening, and sold goods worth 389,000 yuan in total.

Deputy Director of the Taiyuan City Commercial Bureau, Zhu Moguang, who accompanied the team to the countryside, told the reporter: "In response to this year's market conditions, companies under the Commercial Bureau system have all changed from 'stationary merchants' to 'mobile merchants.' So far, just the apparel wholesale, textile wholesale, and small commodity wholesale companies have sold industrial products worth over 7 million yuan in the countryside, leaving their footprints from the Taihang Mountains to the Lvliang Mountains, from the Yanmen Pass to the banks of the Yellow River."

    乡下来了大篷车
    汪振望
    太原市清徐县清源镇每年要举办两次传统庙会。11月4日举办的这次庙会，由于有60多辆送货下乡的“大篷车队”参加，显得格外热闹。
    “大篷车队”是由太原市一商局系统46个基层单位组成的。他们在马路两旁摆上长长的摊位，足有一公里。出售的商品有彩电、洗衣机、自行车、衬衫、棉袜、火柴等，品种达2500多种。“削价处理”、“保退保换”的广告牌一个接一个，使许多农民喜出望外。
    在五金摊位上，铁锹头成了抢手货。一位中年农民买了两把，边走边乐呵呵地对同伴说：“这玩艺儿，只是表面有一层锈，三块五一把，真便宜。现在搞农田水利建设，正用得着，以前我买的可要花六七块。”
    一位农妇驻足在削价处理的花格衬衣前，售货人员微笑着向她解释：“现在城里人穿戴讲究新款式，这些衬衣式样一般，在城里卖不动。可是降到七块五一件，多便宜，农村干活时穿，很合适。”农妇点头称是，掏出了自己的钱包。
    有不少高档消费品是按批发价出售，电视机、洗衣机、名牌自行车吸引了不少顾客。丰富的商品，热情的服务，着实让一些不出远门的农民大开眼界。一位60多岁的老大爷在摊位前转来转去，对“送货下乡”赞不绝口：“过去我们乡下人害怕店里的‘冷面孔’，现在省城来的售货员这么热情，连削价处理商品都管退管换，真是不多见。”
    送货下乡持续了3天，太原市一商局系统的300多名职工冒着寒风，早出晚归，一共推销了价值38.9万元的商品。
    随队下乡的太原市一商局副局长朱慕光告诉记者：“针对今年市场状况，一商局系统所属公司纷纷变‘坐商’为‘行商’。到目前为止，光服装批发、纺织品批发、小商品批发三个公司就下乡推销工业品700多万元，从太行山到吕梁山，从雁门关到黄河岸边都留下了他们的足迹。”
