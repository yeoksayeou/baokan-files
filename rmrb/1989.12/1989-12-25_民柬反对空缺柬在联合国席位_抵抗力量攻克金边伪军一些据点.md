Democratic Kampuchea Radio broadcasted a commentary yesterday stating that the Cambodian people and the Cambodian patriotic resistance forces firmly oppose the plot to leave Cambodia's seat in the United Nations vacant.

The commentary said, in seeking peace in Cambodia, should we strip the Cambodian people of their legitimate rights in the United Nations, or should we find measures to end the Vietnamese invasion and illegal occupation of Cambodia? Vietnam has occupied Cambodia for 11 years, and it unreasonably rejects the resolutions on the Cambodian issue passed by successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, while continuously sending more troops to Cambodia. This November, Vietnam sent an additional 15,000 troops to Cambodia. Currently, there are 130,000 Vietnamese troops in various forms in Cambodia, as well as tens of thousands of Vietnamese armed settlers and several thousand Vietnamese officers mixed into the Cambodian puppet government at various levels.

The commentary believes that under these circumstances, if the legitimate representatives of the Cambodian people, the Democratic Kampuchea United Government, are stripped of their seat in the United Nations, it would be encouraging Vietnamese aggression and punishing the suffering Cambodian people. This is extremely unjust. It not only threatens the survival of the Cambodian nation but also endangers world peace, stability, and order.

According to a report from the office of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing, on December 18, the Sihanouk National Army in the northern Cambodian province of Oddar Meanchey, from the Three-Long Market to the village of Pong, along the 68th National Highway, captured 8 enemy positions and cut off the 68th National Highway leading to the Three-Long Market.

According to a military source from the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea today, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea launched a fierce attack on the Vietnamese-Khmer Rouge forces garrisoned in the town of Anlong Veng in Oddar Meanchey Province on December 19 and 20, and controlled the town of Anlong Veng.

According to a report from the Democratic Kampuchea resistance forces, the resistance forces recently attacked the Doren position and its surrounding defenses on the 10th National Highway in Battambang Province, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers.

### 民柬反对空缺柬在联合国席位  抵抗力量攻克金边伪军一些据点

    民柬反对空缺柬在联合国席位
    抵抗力量攻克金边伪军一些据点
    新华社北京12月22日电　民主柬埔寨电台昨天广播的一篇评论说，柬埔寨人民和柬埔寨爱国抵抗力量坚决反对把柬埔寨在联合国的席位空缺的阴谋。
    评论说，在谋求柬埔寨和平时，到底是应当剥夺柬埔寨人民在联合国的合法权力，还是应当寻找结束越南侵略和非法占领柬埔寨的措施？越南侵占柬埔寨已有11年了，越南无理拒绝联合国历届大会通过的有关柬埔寨问题决议，并不断向柬埔寨增派军队。今年11月，越南就向柬增兵1.5万人，目前驻柬各种形式越军已达13万人，还有数万名越南武装移民和混入柬伪各级政权任职的数万名越南军官。
    评论认为，在这种情况下，如果剥夺柬埔寨人民合法代表民柬联合政府在联合国的席位，就是鼓励越南侵略，就是惩罚受害的柬埔寨人民。这是极不公正的行为。它不仅将危及柬埔寨民族的存亡，而且还危及世界和平、稳定与秩序。
    据新华社北京12月22日电　据民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王驻北京办公室提供的战绩公报说，西哈努克民族军18日在柬埔寨北部的奥多棉吉省境内从三隆市到蓬村的68号公路沿线，攻克敌军8个据点，切断了通往三隆市的68号公路。
    新华社曼谷12月23日电　据民柬国民军军方人士今天说，民柬国民军12月19日和20日向越南—金边军队驻守的奥多棉吉省安龙文县城发动猛烈进攻，并控制了安龙文县城。
    据新华社北京12月20日电　民主柬埔寨抵抗力量最近袭击马德望省10号公路上的德楞据点及其周围防线，共消灭敌军百余人。
