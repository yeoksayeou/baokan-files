The Fourth Lomé Convention was officially signed today. The convention will come into effect in February 1990.

The European Economic Community (EEC) 12 countries and 68 countries from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific region signed the agreement.

The new convention stipulates that the EEC will provide financial aid totaling 12 billion European Currency Units (approximately $13.2 billion) to the ACP (African, Caribbean, and Pacific) countries over the next five years, of which 10.8 billion will be grants and 1.2 billion will be concessional loans. The total amount is 40% higher than the previous Lomé Convention.

The main new content of the convention includes: the EEC will financially support some ACP countries' recent economic structural adjustment plans, allowing these countries to no longer repay the compensation funds provided for stabilizing export revenues due to the decline in raw material prices and mineral product output; further expanding the import of agricultural and industrial products to these countries.

Togo President Gnassingbé Eyadéma said in his speech at the signing ceremony that the imbalance between poor and rich countries is becoming increasingly severe. It is in this worrying economic environment that the EEC and ACP countries have decided to come closer together, engage in dialogue, and jointly seek mechanisms to correct the imbalances and inequalities in trade.

He also said that the debt problem of developing countries can only be truly solved by setting fair and reasonable prices for raw materials.

The President of the Council of Ministers of the EEC, French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the ACP, Lesotho Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs Michael Sefali, also spoke at the ceremony.

The Lomé Convention is an important form of dialogue and cooperation between the EEC and some African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries over the years, and it is also the most important South-North cooperation agreement to date. The first Lomé Convention was signed in 1975. This is the signing of the fourth Lomé Convention, with a term of 10 years, which is double the length of previous conventions and will last until the year 2000.

    第4个《洛美协定》正式签署
    80个国家签字　明年2月生效
    新华社洛美12月15日电  （记者潘永明、季晓峰）第4个《洛美协定》今天在这里正式签署。该协定将于1990年2月起生效。
    欧洲经济共同体12国和非洲、加勒比和太平洋地区68国在协定文本上签了字。
    这项新协定规定，欧共体在未来5年内将向非加太地区国家提供财政援助120亿欧洲货币单位（合132亿美元），其中108亿为赠款，12亿为优惠贷款。总金额比上一个《洛美协定》增加40％。
    协定的主要新内容是：欧共体在财政上支持一些非加太地区国家近年来所进行的经济结构调整计划，允许这些国家不再偿还为稳定因原料价格下跌和矿产品产量下降后的出口收入所提供的补偿金；进一步向这些国家扩大农产品和工业品的进口等。
    多哥总统埃亚德马在签字仪式上发表讲话说，穷国和富国之间的不平衡日益加剧，正是在这种令人担忧的经济环境中，欧共体和非加太地区国家决定相互靠拢，进行对话，共同寻求使它们得以纠正贸易中不平衡和不平等的机制。
    他还说，发展中国家的外债问题只有通过规定公正和合理的原料价格才能得到真正的解决。
    欧共体部长理事会主席、法国总理米歇尔·罗卡尔和非加太部长理事会主席、莱索托计划和经济事务大臣迈克尔·塞法利等也在仪式上讲了话。
    《洛美协定》是欧共体与一些非洲、加勒比和太平洋国家多年来进行对话和合作的重要形式，也是迄今最重要的南北合作协定。第一个《洛美协定》签订于1975年。这次是签署第4个《洛美协定》，有效期为10年，比以往的协定要长1倍，正好到2000年。
