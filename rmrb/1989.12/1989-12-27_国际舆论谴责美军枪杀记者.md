In recent days, several international news associations have issued statements strongly condemning the U.S. military for killing Spanish journalist Rodrigo Rodriguez during its invasion of Panama.

Rodriguez was shot and killed by U.S. troops on December 21 at the entrance of the Marriott Hotel in Panama City. Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez recently expressed his condolences to the leadership of the *El País* newspaper over Rodriguez's death.

The Spanish Photojournalists Association issued a statement on December 23 saying, "The U.S. military shooting a journalist is akin to shooting at the entire society."

European Federation of Journalists President Alvaro Alvarez stated on December 21 that the death of the Spanish journalist "reflects the brutality of the U.S. military during its invasion of Panama."

The Latin American Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York, demanded on December 21 that U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney order U.S. troops "not to infringe upon the rights of journalists."
