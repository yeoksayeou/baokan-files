Christmas, an annual festivity in Western countries, is a time of joy and celebration. Devout Christians praise Jesus, people prepare for the New Year, and children are overjoyed. However, in different countries, children's festivities have unique characteristics, presenting a vibrant array of traditions.

Singing Welcome Songs and Enjoying Delicacies

In countries like Britain, the United States, and other English-speaking regions, people still preserve the authentic traditions of Christmas. Adults start preparing various foods and gifts for children as early as November. By December, children eagerly venture out every evening, gathering in groups to "roam" the streets and alleys, singing songs to welcome Christmas. As long as they knock on doors, any household will warmly invite the children in and offer them delicious treats. On Christmas Eve, every family "distributes" turkey meat, Christmas pudding, biscuits, and drinks to the children, who enjoy eating and playing all night long. Besides sending out New Year's cards in advance, the children gather together to exchange gifts and have a wild celebration.

Christmas Dumplings with Fragrant Aroma

On the eve of Christmas, the streets and alleys of Venezuelan towns are filled with a fragrant aroma. Every family is busy wrapping and cooking dumplings. Eating dumplings is a major delight of the festival, especially for children. Even shops that usually sell various pastries temporarily transform into "Christmas dumpling stores."

Children take the initiative to wrap dumplings, showcasing their skill and creativity, which earns them admiration from others. The variety of dumplings is extensive, including those made with corn, rice, flour, ham, bacon, and dried grapes or other fruits. The wrappers are made from fresh banana leaves, and the dumplings are usually shaped like rectangles, with some weighing about half a kilogram. The cooking method is unique: the banana leaves are dried over a low flame, and the dumplings are cooked. Once the banana leaves are peeled off, the aroma is irresistible, and children eagerly eat to their heart's content, satisfying their year-long cravings.

Loving White Attire and Enjoying Christmas Parcels

The people of East Africa's Ethiopia regard white as a symbol of purity and celebration. When Christmas arrives, children dress in brand-new white attire to greet adults and wish them a happy holiday. Adults, in turn, reward the children with "Christmas parcels."

"Christmas parcels" are made from high-quality barley, wrapped with various fillings, and baked. The skin is very tender, with a golden hue, and topped with jam, making them memorable to eat and enjoy.

"No Feast Without Chicken"

Filipinos have a tradition of the whole family preparing a "Christmas feast" for the children. During the Christmas season, children are busy preparing the main dish for the "Christmas feast"—chicken. When adults cook the chicken, they also let the children taste it first.

Filipinos believe that chicken is not only the best dish but also a symbol of good fortune and tranquility. A family with more chicken in their "Christmas feast" is considered prosperous, with at least one or two chickens. There is a saying, "No feast without chicken," so how can the "Christmas feast" be without chicken?

Fasting Before Feasting on "Three Kings' Day" Gifts

On Christmas Eve, Italians fast all day, and children are no exception. Only after midnight mass can they feast, and children can freely choose their favorite foods.

The country has a custom of giving children gifts on "Three Kings' Day." On this day, gifts are brought to the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem. The way gifts are given is also particular: timid or naughty children do not receive gifts from Santa Claus, only brave and good children can. Therefore, when Christmas comes, Italian children behave exceptionally well.

Waiting for the First Star

Polish children are most attentive in the evening of Christmas. They stare at the sky, eagerly awaiting the appearance of the first star. Once they see it, people can "start the feast" and enjoy a hearty meal.

During the feast, people pass around a "Christmas bread" carved with images of Mary and Jesus. Whoever receives it cuts off a small piece to eat. Children can cut a large piece to eat alone, showing their devotion.

Decorating the Christmas Tree

Finnish children are the busiest and bravest on Christmas Eve. Before the snowflakes fill the sky and the ground is covered with ice, they gather and head into the forest to find a Christmas tree. They drag the cut Christmas tree home on a sled and place it in the room prepared for the celebration.

Afterward, the children decorate the Christmas tree using methods they have learned from adults. Generally, they carefully attach grains to the Christmas tree to symbolize happiness, joy, and good fortune.

    圣诞节日孩子乐
    柯谱　宝成
    一年一度的圣诞节是西方各国喜气洋洋的佳节。教徒们虔颂耶稣，人们备迎新年，孩子们乐不可支。但在不同的国家，孩子们的玩乐也各有特色，异彩纷呈。
    高唱欢迎歌　喜食美味品
    在英国、美国和一些讲英语的国家和地区，人们至今保存着圣诞节的正宗传统。成人们从11月起就忙着准备各种食品和送给孩子们的礼物。12月份开始，孩子们就每晚奔出家门，成群结队到大街小巷去“遨游”，一边高唱迎接圣诞的歌曲。他们只要肯敲家门，不论哪家都会把孩子们盛情邀至家中，分送美味食品。圣诞节前夜，家家户户给孩子们“发放”火鸡肉、圣诞布丁、酥饼和饮料，孩子们边吃边玩，通宵达旦。小朋友们除事先寄出贺年卡外，大伙欢聚一处，交换礼物，狂欢尽情。
    节日粽子　清香四溢
    圣诞节前夕，委内瑞拉城镇街巷，到处飘逸着一股扑鼻清香。这是每家都在包粽子、煮粽子。吃棕子是节日的一大乐处，尤其是孩子们吃棕子特别高兴。这时就连平日卖各种点心的铺店也临时改为清一色的“圣诞粽子店”了。
    孩子们自己动手包粽子，手巧心灵，很受人们赞叹。这里粽子品种繁多，有玉米的，大米的，面粉的，火腿的，腊肉的，还有葡萄干等果脯的。粽叶是用新鲜蕉叶，包成的形状多为长方的，有的一个粽子重约半公斤。做法也与众不同，是放在文火上焙干蕉叶，粽子就熟了。剥开蕉叶，香气袭人，孩子愿吃饱吃足，以解一年之馋。
    爱穿白盛装　喜食圣诞包
    东非的伊索皮亚人以白色为圣洁，为喜庆的象征。圣诞来临，孩子们都穿上崭新的白色盛装，向成人拜年贺节。家长和成人在接受孩子们祝福时，要赠赏他们“圣诞包”。
    “圣诞包”是用上好大麦，包了多种馅子烤制而成的。皮子十分细嫩，色泽金黄，涂上果酱，食之品之，令人难忘。
    “无鸡不成宴”
    菲律宾人有全家齐动手，为孩子们做“圣诞饭”的传统风习。圣诞佳节，孩子们为准备“圣诞饭”主菜——鸡而忙碌。家长做鸡时，也要先让孩子们尝一尝。
    菲律宾人认为，鸡不仅是菜肴中最好的，而且是吉祥、安宁的象征。谁家“圣诞饭”鸡多，就是丰盛，至少也得有一两只。在这里有句俗话“无鸡不成宴”，“圣诞饭”岂能成“无鸡之谈”？！
    先斋后荤“三王节”礼
    意大利人在圣诞节前夜，要整天吃斋，嘴馋的孩子也不例外。直到午夜做完弥撒后才大吃大喝，孩子们任意挑选心爱的食物。
    该国有“三王节”后给孩子们礼物的习俗。因为“三王节”这天要带礼物到耶稣诞生的圣地伯利恒去。礼物的赠给方式也很讲究，胆小的、不好的孩子，得不到圣诞老人的礼物，只有勇敢的好孩子才能得到。所以，圣诞节来临之际，意大利的孩子表现得特别出色。
    等待第一颗星
    波兰的孩子们，在圣诞节傍晚最为专注。他们睁大双眼盯着苍天，急切地盼着天幕上出现第一颗星。因为见到它，人们就可以“开席”饱餐了。
    人们在席间要传递一块雕有玛利亚和耶稣像的“圣诞饼”。传到谁，就切一小块吃。孩子们则可以切大块独吃，以示虔诚。
    装扮圣诞树
    芬兰的孩子们在圣诞节前夜是最忙碌，也是最勇敢。他们在雪花满天、冰盖大地之前，相约而出，到森林中去寻找圣诞树。他们把砍下的圣诞树用雪橇拉回家去，亲手安放在准备庆祝佳节的房间里。
    之后，孩子们用从成人那里学来的美化圣诞树的办法装扮起来，一般是把带有谷粒的禾细心地扎到圣诞树上，以示幸福、欢乐与吉祥。
