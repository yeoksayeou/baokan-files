The Soviet Cultural Foundation was established in 1987. In just over two years, this new all-Soviet mass social organization has done a great deal to promote the traditional cultures of the Soviet Union's various nationalities and has become an important force in the cultural life of the Soviet people.

Collecting scattered works of art is the foundation's first task. In the foundation's exhibition halls, people can appreciate rare cultural treasures, from ancient folk handicrafts to precious oil paintings by famous masters. In addition to collecting within the country, the foundation has a long-term plan to repatriate those national treasures that have, for various reasons, been lost abroad and are in danger of being destroyed or appearing on the auction market.

While collecting works of art, the foundation places even greater emphasis on integrating these valuable spiritual assets into the mainstream of Soviet cultural life, so that they can play the greatest possible social role. The foundation uses a considerable number of artworks to hold traveling exhibitions throughout the Soviet Union; it is particularly concerned with the cultural life of remote regions. Many small museums have also benefited from the foundation's donations.

The foundation's goal is to ensure that residents of remote areas enjoy the same cultural rights as those in large cities.

In addition, the foundation actively helps private collectors hold personal exhibitions and has established the All-Soviet Club of Collectors of Fine Arts and Applied Decorative Arts under its auspices. "True works of art belong to all humanity," says Academician Likhachev, the foundation's chairman. "The legal ownership of artworks should certainly not be violated, but owners have an obligation to allow people to see, hear, read, or study these artworks."

The foundation believes that cultural heritage should be approached with an attitude of "protection, assimilation, and development." Attention to cultural phenomena of the past should not be isolated but should be combined with solving contemporary cultural problems; the study of traditional culture aims to inherit excellent traditions. Based on this idea, the foundation has formulated several long-term plans, which have already begun to be implemented.

"Cultural Heritage and Modern Life." Inheriting and developing folk art creation, and giving folk and folk art forms a modern life rhythm, is an important part of the foundation's plans.

"The Eternal Pushkin" is another long-term plan of the foundation. Modern Russian language, Russian literature, and Russian modern democratic consciousness are all linked to this great name. Commemorating this poet has always been an important means for the Soviet people to promote patriotism. The foundation's plans include establishing the "Pushkin Society" and holding an "All-Soviet Pushkin Festival" every year on the poet's birthday.

As part of the "Youth and Culture" program, the foundation has established a youth art work consultation agency and will establish a youth art society – the "Classical Works Research Society." The purpose of this long-term plan is to enhance young people's interest in and appreciation of classical literature, music, fine arts, and other works, and to cultivate a group of young connoisseurs of classical art.

The Soviet Cultural Foundation places such importance on cultural heritage not just for the sake of preservation, but for the sake of people. Academician Likhachev's words are profound: "Any culture has a humanistic essence because it originates from people and serves people. No matter what profession a person engages in, their professional cultivation first depends on their humanistic cultivation. Moreover, humanistic cultivation is the foundation of ethics, morality, and sentiment."

### 文化遗产：“保护、消化、发展”——苏维埃文化基金会

    文化遗产：“保护、消化、发展”
    ——苏维埃文化基金会
    胡锡进
    苏维埃文化基金会成立于1987年。在短短的两年多时间里，这个新生的全苏群众性社会组织为弘扬苏联各民族的传统文化做了大量工作，已经成为苏联人民文化生活中的一支重要力量。
    收集散失的艺术品是基金会的第一项工作。在基金会的展厅里，人们可以欣赏到鲜为人知的文化珍品，从古朴的民间手工艺品到出自名家手笔的珍贵油画。除了在国内收集外，基金会的一个长远计划是将那些由于种种原因流失到国外，并且有可能遭到破坏或是出现在拍卖市场的国宝购回国内。
    在收集艺术品的同时，基金会更注重将这些宝贵的精神财富汇入苏联人民文化生活的主流，使它们发挥最大的社会效益。基金会用相当一部分艺术品在全苏境内举办巡回展览；尤其关心偏远地区的文化生活。许多小博物馆还受益于基金会的捐赠。
    基金会的目标是，让偏远地区的居民与大城市的居民享受同样的文化生活权利。
    此外，基金会还积极帮助私人收藏家举办个人展览，并在基金会下设立了全苏造型艺术和实用装饰艺术品收藏家俱乐部。“真正的艺术珍品属于全人类”。基金会主席利哈切夫院士说，“艺术品的法律所有权固然不应破坏，但是，所有者有让人们看到、听到、读到或者研究这些艺术品的义务。”
    对文化遗产应采取“保护、消化、发展”的态度。基金会认为，对历史上文化现象的注意不应是孤立的，应当与解决现实的文化问题结合起来；对传统文化的研究旨在继承优秀的传统。基于这种思想，基金会制定了几项长远计划，并已开始实施。
    “文化遗产与现代生活”。继承、发展民间艺术创作，给民俗、民间艺术形式配上现代生活节奏是基金会计划的重要内容。
    “普希金在历代人心中”是基金会的另一项长远计划。现代俄语、俄国文学、俄国近代民主意识无不与这个伟大的名字联在一起。纪念这位诗人历来是苏联人民弘扬爱国主义精神的重要手段。基金会的计划包括成立“普希金学会”，每年在诗人生日那天举办“全苏普希金节”。
    作为“青年和文化”计划的一部分，基金会设立了青年艺术工作咨询机构，还将成立一个青年艺术学会——“古典作品研究会”。这项长远计划的目的在于提高青年人对古典文学、音乐、美术等作品的兴趣和欣赏能力，培养一批古典艺术品的青年鉴赏家。
    苏维埃文化基金会如此重视文化遗产不是为保护而保护，而是为了人。利哈切夫院士一番话意味深长：“任何文化都具有人文的本质，因为它发之于人并服务于人。一个人无论干哪种行业，他的职业修养首先取决于他的人文修养。此外，人文修养还是一个伦理道德、情操的基础。”
