Vice Foreign Minister Qi Huaiyuan recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters that Chairman Yang Shangkun's upcoming visit to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman is of great and far-reaching significance. This will be the first overseas trip by a Chinese president since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing in early June.

Vice Minister Qi Huaiyuan will accompany Chairman Yang on this visit. He said that Yang's visit not only shows that the situation in China is stable but also reflects that China has not changed its foreign policy. Strengthening solidarity and cooperation with Third World countries remains a fundamental point of China's foreign policy.

According to earlier announcements, Chairman Yang Shangkun will begin his official friendly visits to the four countries on December 18.

Qi said that China has always had friendly relations with Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman, and these relations have developed smoothly. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between them, and all parties are satisfied with the friendly cooperative relationship that has been established. Politically, China's relations with the four countries are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, with mutual sincerity, respect, and equality. On issues such as the just, comprehensive, and peaceful resolution of the Middle East problem and the realization of stability and peace in the Gulf region, as well as other major international and regional issues, China and the four countries support and coordinate each other's positions, setting an example for relations between countries. Over the years, there have been frequent mutual visits between the leaders of China and the four countries. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has visited China several times, and Chairman Li Xiannian has visited Egypt. Other Chinese leaders have also visited the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman. These bilateral exchanges have deepened mutual understanding and trust.

He added that economically, China and the four countries have their own advantages and have established various forms of cooperative relationships, with mutual benefit, complementarity, and common development. In recent years, the governments of China and the four countries have actively developed economic, trade, contracting, labor service, and technological cooperation, achieving significant progress and successes. Cultural and sports exchanges have also been expanding.

Qi said that the Chinese government and people highly value their friendship with these four countries. Continuously consolidating and developing this friendship is China's established policy.

He revealed that during Chairman Yang Shangkun's official friendly visit to the four countries, he will exchange views with the leaders of the four countries on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern and will introduce each other's domestic situations and foreign policies. He expressed his belief that Chairman Yang Shangkun's visit to these four Arab countries will achieve the goals of increasing understanding, strengthening friendship, promoting cooperation, and common development.

    杨主席出访亚非四国意义重大
    表明中国局势稳定将加强与第三世界合作
    新华社北京12月14日电  （记者周慈朴）中国外交部副部长齐怀远最近在接受新华社记者采访时说，杨尚昆主席即将出访埃及、阿联酋、科威特、阿曼等亚非四国，是中国国家主席在平息6月初发生在北京的反革命暴乱后的首次出访，“具有十分重大和深远的意义。”
    齐怀远副外长这次将陪同杨尚昆主席出访。他说，杨主席这次出访不仅表明中国国内局势稳定，同时也反映出中国没有改变外交政策，加强与第三世界国家的团结与合作仍是中国对外政策的基本点。
    根据早些时候的宣布，杨尚昆主席将于12月18日开始对上述四国进行正式友好访问。
    齐怀远说，中国同埃及、阿联酋、科威特和阿曼四国关系一直友好，发展顺利，彼此无根本利害冲突，都对业已建立起来的友好合作关系表示满意。在政治上，中国同四国的关系建立在和平共处五项原则基础之上，彼此真诚相待，互相尊重，完全平等。在公正、全面、合理解决中东问题和实现海湾地区稳定与和平以及其它重大国际和地区问题上，中国同四国相互支持、协调立场，成为国与国之间关系的典范。多年来，中国同四国领导人互访频繁，穆巴拉克总统曾经多次访华，李先念主席访问过埃及，中国其他领导人也曾访问过阿联酋、科威特和阿曼三国。这种双边往来加深了相互了解和信任。
    他接着说，在经济上中国同四国有着各自的优势，建立了多种形式的合作关系，平等互利，取长补短，共同发展。近年来，中国和四国政府积极发展经济、贸易、承包、劳务和科技合作，并取得了长足的进展和可喜的成就，文化体育方面的交流也不断扩大。
    齐怀远说，中国政府和人民十分珍视同这四个国家的友谊。不断巩固和发展这一友谊是中国的既定政策。
    他透露，杨尚昆主席这次对四国进行正式友好访问时，将同四国领导人就双边关系和共同关心的国际问题交换意见，并相互介绍各自国内的情况和对外政策。他表示相信，杨尚昆主席对这四个阿拉伯国家的访问将达到增进了解、加强友谊、促进合作和共同发展的目的。
