The recent national commercial planning conference held in Guangxi emphasized that the commercial sector should prioritize market stability as its central task and properly arrange the urban and rural markets for next year.

Delegates at the conference noted that after more than a year of rectification and regulation, the market situation is improving. However, new contradictions have emerged in addressing long-standing issues, such as sluggish sales and certain products becoming unsellable. Notably, while some products are not selling well, the overall market demand still exceeds supply, particularly for essential goods related to national and people's livelihoods. The commercial sector must fully recognize the challenges facing next year's market while also acknowledging the favorable conditions for overcoming these difficulties, and strive to arrange the market effectively.

In his concluding remarks, Zhang Shiyao, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Commerce, emphasized several principles for next year's market arrangement. First, prioritize the overall situation, with local interests consciously subordinating to the overall interests. Second, implement differentiated guidance based on different products and regions. For products, focus on ensuring the supply of essential goods for people's livelihoods, particularly grains, vegetables, and daily necessities. Third, correctly guide production and consumption. On one hand, actively collaborate with agricultural and industrial production departments to adjust product structures and increase marketable products; on the other hand, correctly guide consumption, controlling what needs to be controlled and actively promoting reasonable consumption. Fourth, both rectify the circulation order and expand the market to improve it.

Zhang Shiyao outlined several key measures the commercial sector will take to arrange next year's market: vigorously support agricultural production and strive to do a good job in various support measures for agriculture, currently focusing on the peak season procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and actively organizing supplies to meet the needs of agricultural water conservancy construction this winter and next spring; spare no effort to support industrial production and collaborate with industrial departments to adjust production structures; and strive to expand the market and increase sales, ensuring good supply for the New Year and Spring Festival markets.

    全国商业计划会议强调
    千方百计安排好明年市场
    新华社南宁12月24日电（记者衡志诚）最近在广西召开的全国商业计划会议强调，商业部门要把稳定市场作为中心任务，妥善安排好明年城乡市场。
    与会代表认为，通过一年多的治理整顿，市场形势正朝着好的方向发展。但是，在解决多年积累的问题时，又出现了市场销售不畅、某些商品滞销等新的矛盾。值得注意的是，当前一方面市场上部分商品销售不畅，另一方面市场总需求与总供给仍有较大缺口，特别是有些关系国计民生的商品仍然不足。商业部门既要充分认识明年市场面临的困难，又要充分认识克服困难的有利条件，千方百计把明年市场安排好。
    商业部副部长张世尧在总结发言中强调了明年市场安排的几项原则。首先，提倡顾全大局，局部利益必须自觉地服从全局利益。其次，要根据不同商品、不同地区的情况实行分类指导。从商品来说，要重点安排好人民生活必需品的供应，特别要抓好“米袋子”、“菜篮子”和生活必需的日用工业品的供应。第三，要正确引导生产，指导消费。一方面积极配合工农业生产部门调整产品结构，增产市场适销对路的产品；另一方面又要正确引导消费，该控制的要控制，该引导的合理消费也要积极引导。第四，既要整顿流通秩序，又要开拓市场，搞好市场。
    张世尧提出商业部门安排好明年市场将采取的几项主要措施是：大力支持农业生产，努力做好各项支农工作，当前要抓好旺季农副产品收购，还要积极组织货源，保证今冬明春农田水利基本建设的需要；千方百计支持工业生产，配合工业部门大力调整生产结构；努力开拓市场，扩大销售，要搞好元旦、春节两大节日市场供应。
