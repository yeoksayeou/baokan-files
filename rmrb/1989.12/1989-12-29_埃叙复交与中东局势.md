As the year-end approaches, both Cairo and Damascus have released good news: after twelve years of severed ties, Egypt and Syria have restored formal diplomatic relations. The two major Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa have mended their fences and joined hands once again.

The restoration of diplomatic relations between Syria and Egypt is not just a significant event for the two countries but also a major development for the Arab world. The reconciliation of the two brotherly nations and the resumption of full diplomatic relations not only serve the common interests of both countries but also play a positive role in strengthening the unity of Arab countries and jointly safeguarding the interests of Arab nations. The normalization of relations between Egypt and Syria will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the overall situation in the Middle East.

Towards the end of the 1980s, the global landscape underwent dramatic changes. The two superpowers moved from confrontation to détente, most hotspots had cooled down, international politics were trending towards multipolarity, and economic development was moving towards regionalization and integration. The development of the European Single Market, the North American Free Trade Area, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Area all posed serious challenges to the Arab world. Arab countries have already taken action, establishing two new regional economic organizations this year alone: the "Maghreb Union" and the "Arab Cooperation Council." Thus, the Arab world now has three regional blocs in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Gulf. This new situation has created favorable conditions for the easing of relations and the full restoration of diplomatic ties between Syria and Egypt.

Middle Eastern history has shown that the bonds between Arab brotherly nations, forged by religion, blood ties, and language, cannot be severed. In 1977, former Egyptian President Sadat's visit to Israel led to a deterioration in relations between Egypt and Syria, eventually resulting in a break in ties. The Arab world subsequently experienced serious divisions. However, as the leaders of Egypt and Syria have said, the brotherly affection between the two countries has never ceased, and their fundamental stance in defending national interests and supporting the just cause of the Palestinian people has been consistent. Since the 1987 Amman Summit of the Arab League, almost all Arab countries have successively resumed diplomatic relations with Egypt. In May of this year, the Casablanca Summit of the Arab League restored Egypt's membership in the Arab League. Following the comprehensive improvement of relations between Libya and Egypt, Syria decisively mended fences with Egypt, finally ending the history of division within the Arab camp in the 1980s and pushing the brotherly relations between the two countries to a new stage.

It is noteworthy that the normalization of relations between Egypt and Syria comes at a crucial moment when the Middle East issue is moving towards a political solution. Arab countries have formed a united front, reaching a consensus on solving the Palestinian issue through political means, and strongly demanding the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The Palestine Liberation Organization, while insisting on its representative rights and the right to self-determination, has agreed to hold direct talks with Israel. Egypt has frequently acted as a mediator between the PLO and the United States and Israel to promote the realization of Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. As a preparatory step for the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, a trilateral foreign ministers' meeting between Egypt, the United States, and Israel may be held in Washington next January. The dialogue trend that has emerged after forty years of Middle East disputes, the restoration of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Syria, and the significant improvement of bilateral relations between Jordan and the PLO, Syria and the PLO, will undoubtedly increase the weight of the Arab dialogue as a whole and put new pressure on Israel. The situation where the Israeli authorities have long benefited from the divided state of the Arabs will come to an end.

The restoration of relations between Egypt and Syria has been warmly welcomed by the Arab world and has won the approval of the international community. An important reason for this is that the development of the Middle East peace process not only requires external promotion but also relies on the joint efforts of all Arab countries. Syria is a key player in the confrontation with Israel. In the process of promoting a political solution to the Middle East issue, the coordination of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon is crucial. The Arab countries speaking with "one voice" will undoubtedly gain the initiative in political negotiations.

The Arab nation must fully rely on the hard-won unity to jointly face the opportunities and challenges of the end of this century and the beginning of the next, in order to achieve new progress in stabilizing the situation in the region and building the national economy. No matter what complex environment the future may bring, the unity of the Arab nation will always be the most reliable foundation for seeking peace and development.

### 埃叙复交与中东局势

    埃叙复交与中东局势
    本报记者　林皎明　吴文斌
    临近年关，开罗和大马士革同时传出令人欣喜的好消息：断交十二年之久的埃及叙利亚两国恢复正式外交关系。西亚北非两个阿拉伯大国重修旧好，携起手来。
    叙埃复交不仅是两国的大事，也是阿拉伯世界的一件大事。两个兄弟国家重新和好，全面恢复外交关系，不仅符合两国的共同利益，也对巩固和加强阿拉伯国家的团结，共同维护阿拉伯国家的利益有着积极作用。埃叙两国关系正常化，必将对整个中东局势产生积极影响。
    八十年代末期，整个世界格局发生了急剧的变化。两个超级大国从对抗走向缓和，大多数热点地区已降温，国际政治趋向多极化，经济发展趋向区域化和一体化。欧洲统一大市场、北美自由贸易区和亚太经济区的发展趋向都对阿拉伯世界构成了严峻的挑战。阿拉伯国家已经纷纷行动起来，仅今年一年内就建立了两个新的地区性经济组织——“马格里布联盟”和“阿拉伯合作委员会”。这样，阿拉伯世界分别在北非、西亚和海湾出现了三个区域性联合体。这一新局面的出现为叙埃关系的缓和以及全面复交创造了有利条件。
    中东历史证明，由宗教、血缘、文字维系着的阿拉伯兄弟国家关系是不可能隔断的。一九七七年，埃及前总统萨达特出访以色列，埃叙两国关系恶化，进而中断。阿拉伯世界随之出现严重分裂。但是，正像埃叙两国领导人所说，两国的兄弟情谊从未间断，两国捍卫民族利益、支持巴勒斯坦人民正义事业的根本立场是一致的。从一九八七年阿盟安曼首脑会议至今的两年中，几乎所有的阿拉伯国家先后恢复了与埃及的外交关系。今年五月，阿盟卡萨布兰卡首脑会议恢复了埃及的阿盟成员国资格。叙利亚继利比亚埃及关系全面改善后，果断地与埃及破镜重圆，最终结束了阿拉伯阵营八十年代分裂的历史，把两国的兄弟关系推向新阶段。
    人们注意到，埃叙关系正常化正值中东问题走向政治解决的关键时刻。阿拉伯国家形成团结局面，就政治途径解决巴勒斯坦问题达成一致立场，强烈要求召开联合国主持下的中东和平国际会议。巴勒斯坦解放组织在坚持自己的代表权、坚持民族自决权的前题下同意举行巴以直接对话。埃及为促进实现巴以对话，频繁在巴解组织与美以之间斡旋。作为巴以对话的筹备阶段，埃美以三国外长会议可能明年一月在华盛顿召开。历时四十年的中东争端终于出现的对话趋势，埃及和叙利亚复交，约旦与巴解、叙利亚与巴解的双边关系明显改善，无疑将加重阿拉伯作为整体的对话分量，对以色列形成新的压力。以色列当局长期得利于阿拉伯分裂状态的局面将从此结束。
    埃及叙利亚恢复关系，受到阿拉伯世界的热烈欢迎，赢得国际社会的赞许。重要原因还在于，中东和平进程的发展，不仅需要外界的推动，而且有赖于所有阿拉伯国家的共同努力。叙利亚是与以色列对阵的重要一方。在阿拉伯国家促进中东问题政治解决的过程中，埃及、叙利亚、约旦、巴勒斯坦和黎巴嫩五国加强磋商，协调立场，是至关重要的。阿拉伯国家“用同一个声音说话”，必将赢得政治谈判斗争中的主动地位。
    阿拉伯民族只有充分依靠得来不易的团结局面，共同迎接本世纪末和下世纪初的机会和挑战，才能在实现本地区形势稳定和本国经济建设中取得新的进展。无论未来将面临何种复杂的环境，阿拉伯民族的团结将始终是它们争取和平、寻求发展最可靠的基石。（本报开罗、大马士革十二月二十八日电）
