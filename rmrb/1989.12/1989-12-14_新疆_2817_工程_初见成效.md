The "2817 Project" in the Altay Region of Xinjiang, assisted by the World Food Programme, has shown initial success after two years of implementation. So far, over 220,000 mu of desert wasteland has been developed. More than 240 households of Kazakh herdsmen have bid farewell to their traditional nomadic lifestyle and settled in this project area. This project, coded as 2817, includes the construction of 460,000 mu of forage grassland, 68,000 mu of forest belts, as well as supporting facilities such as roads, canals, and settlements. The plan is to complete the project in phases over five years, accommodating 8,600 households of herdsmen by then.
