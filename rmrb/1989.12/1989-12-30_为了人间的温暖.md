For the Warmth of Humanity

In our country, coal is one of the most abundant resources. The proven coal reserves are 860 billion tons, with potential reserves reaching tens of trillions of tons.

Currently, coal accounts for more than 70% of China's total energy consumption. Experts estimate that this proportion will continue for another 20 to 30 years.

To awaken the long-dormant treasure, to promote the development of the national economy, a 7 million-strong coal army has been fighting in the rugged mountains of our motherland for years. Under difficult and harsh conditions, they wage war against the earth day and night. Like coal, they burn themselves silently, illuminating the way for others.

At the request of readers, reporters from the Mass Work Department's Letter and Visit Office of this newspaper recently visited the Beijing Jinxixi Coal Mine for an investigation. Readers can learn about the image of coal miners, feel the atmosphere of mine life, and experience the hardships of mining work from this report. Their entrepreneurial spirit is truly moving. If people from all walks of life strive to carry forward the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and dedication to the country, our national economy will surely develop further; the difficulties we encounter will definitely be overcome.

Learning from the Spirit of Selflessness of Coal Mine Workers

Dear Editor,

The 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic is also a period of great development for the coal industry. The workers fighting on the mines across the country play a crucial role in the prosperity of our country's economy.

The battlefields of the workers are at depths of thousands or even tens of thousands of meters underground. The working face is illuminated only by small headlamps, and all around is pitch-black coal. Their hands hold coal, their faces rub against coal. After a shift, their faces are so black that even fathers and sons passing each other might not recognize one another. When working, the workers move from one coal pit to another, carrying iron and wooden pillars weighing hundreds of pounds on their shoulders, and climbing slopes with large iron shovels. They work for 8 hours or even the whole day without seeing the sun. Water, fire, gas, coal dust, and roof falls are natural disasters that threaten their safety.

The bodies of coal miners are black, but their hearts are red. They deserve to be praised. I hope you can report on the spirit of selflessness of coal mine workers and also reflect their troubles at work, so that they can gain the understanding and support of society.

Ningxia Shitanjing San Mine
Yang Shusen

After reading Yang Shusen's letter, our editors and reporters were deeply moved.

To reflect the image of coal mine workers as soon as possible, the reporter focused on interviewing the Beijing Mining Bureau.

The dangers of coal mining work seem to be well-known, but when we arrived at the front line, we truly felt that it was beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

Waging War on the Earth

The two gifts from nature—fresh air and warm sunlight—are hard for miners to enjoy. There are very few open-pit coal mines in China, and the battlefield of miners is mainly in the cold, damp, and dark underground. Working underground has several characteristics: dirty. As miners jokingly put it, after a day's work, the coal dust in their nostrils can be rolled into a coal ball, and coal miners never have a "white face." Tiring. According to statistics, for every 10,000 tons of coal mined, 60 cubic meters of wood, 20 tons of steel, and 50 tons of cement are needed. Due to the complex coal seams in the Jinxixi Coal Mine, most of which are medium-thin, the mechanization rate of coal mining in the Beijing Mining Bureau is only 12%. The commonly used tools of miners are electric drills, electric winches, iron shovels, and pickaxes. Because the mining area is large and the mine extends far, for every 10,000 tons of coal mined, 50 to 60 meters of rock tunnels need to be dug. The narrow tunnels make it difficult for people to work. Wooden supports that are 2 meters long and 18 centimeters in diameter can only be carried in and out with difficulty, and 400 pairs of supports are needed for a 300-meter tunnel. Hard. From the mine mouth to the working face, the shortest distance is hundreds of meters, and the longest takes an hour or two to walk. Miners wear heavy rain boots and often have to climb slopes of several dozen degrees, crossing mountains and valleys underground. Arriving at the working face, they have already expended a lot of physical strength, and then they have to work hard for 8 hours. Over time, back and leg pain and stomach problems often bother underground workers. Dangerous. They are always threatened by natural disasters such as water, fire, gas, and impact pressure, as well as the harm of coal dust. How do miners view all this? Several people asked the same question: "This job is hard and tiring, but someone has to do it."

To bring light and happiness to society, they leave the darkness to themselves. Facing the harsh environment, miners are so optimistic and open-minded. Wang Qing'an, the section chief of the third section of the coal mining team in Wangping Village, who has been working underground for more than 30 years, confidently told the reporter, "As long as we strictly follow the operating procedures, safety is guaranteed." A 20-year-old peasant contract worker from Sichuan Province cleverly and wittily asked the reporter in return, "Is it safe above ground? I haven't had an accident while working underground, but I injured my hand riding a bicycle on the street a few days ago."

Difficulties and hardships have not made them retreat. Chen Dezhu from the Erdaohuzi Coal Mine in Jixi City, Heilongjiang Province, wrote to our newspaper saying that in their mine, the tunneling worker Liang Chunhe lost three fingers on his right hand in a blasting accident. After recovering, in order to return to the front line of the mine, he worked hard to practice using two fingers to work. After several years of perseverance, he returned to the mine. The leadership arranged for him to do light work above ground, but he insisted on returning to the front line as a tunneling worker. He did not calculate the remuneration and continued to drill, blast, and push the car with his injured hand...

It is with this fearless spirit that miners bravely wage war on the earth, continuously mining the "black gold" that has undergone billions of years of evolution. In this bitterly cold winter, have those who are warming themselves by the stove ever thought of those laborers who are toiling in the cold and damp tunnels hundreds of meters deep?

Burning Themselves, Illuminating Others

Working in coal mines requires giving up the colorful city life and setting up camp in the rolling mountains; it requires sacrificing family affection and being unable to fully care for parents, assist wives, and educate children. In the mining community, many people were unable to see their parents for the last time when they passed away, were unable to be by their wives' side when they gave birth, and were unable to attend their children's parent-teacher conferences when they were about to graduate. To produce more coal, they silently endure all this. Deputy Director of Production for the Beijing Mining Bureau, Liang Mingzhong, lives just a few minutes from his workplace, but for 365 days a year, he is almost always in the office, keeping an eye on the production and safety of the eight mines in the entire bureau; Director Liu Shaokun and Party Secretary Zhang Shaofeng always have instant noodles in their cabinets because they often don't have time to eat when they are busy with work; Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang Kesheng rarely spends holidays with his family; Mine Director Liu Tiancai of Wangping Village Mine spends his Sundays underground... This is common among mining leaders. They work without regard to day or night. Workers are the same, and after adding the time for changing clothes and bathing, they often work more than 10 hours a day. Therefore, the wives of miners, in addition to managing the household, taking care of the elderly, and raising children after work, also do not forget to prepare a delicious meal for their husbands who have worked hard all day.

In the mines, one can also feel the greatness of the miners' mothers. A young miner once died in an accident underground. His mother, at his funeral, said firmly, "He did it for society, for the country..." They buried their son's ashes on the mine where he gave his life. Later, the mother also passed away. Before her death, she requested that her ashes be buried with her son. Thus, on the high mountain, this great mother and her unknown son rest in peace together. During the Qingming Festival, whenever the father of this young miner comes to sweep the graves of his wife and son, the mining comrades who once fought side by side with his son will also go together, accompanying the hero's father.

In the Beijing Mining Bureau, one can see people who have left their homes and families and are striving forward without stopping. Some of them have not received their retirement certificates before entering Babaoshan. When they burn themselves out, trains loaded with "black gold" are driving from the mines to Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, to Shougang, Anshan Steel, and Benxi Steel...

They Need Understanding and Support

Coal mine workers have made great contributions to society, but they also have their difficulties. Due to the lack of understanding from many people, mining young men have to come up with a code name for the factory when they fall in love; many people have housing difficulties; the discrepancy between the price and value of coal causes the enterprise to be in long-term deficit, resulting in insufficient production momentum.

Labor is one of the most abundant resources in our country, but the coal industry has many problems in this regard. First, there is a lack of management and technical personnel. In the Beijing Mining Bureau, more than 20 administrative directors, except for 3 people, are all over 55 years old; the entire bureau has more than 9,000 cadres, and more than 300 people are transferred out every year, of which 60% have a junior college education or above; many professional technical positions underground have no successors for the team, squad, and section leaders. Second, it is difficult to recruit miners. Currently, about 60% of the miners on the mining front line are peasant rotation workers or contract workers, and peasant workers have become the mainstay of mine construction. However, with the improvement of living standards in rural areas, it is becoming increasingly difficult for coal mines to recruit workers. Peasant workers mainly rely on eating negotiated grain to live, and the enterprise cannot provide much subsidies, resulting in a large number of peasant workers in some coal mines leaving their jobs, causing a serious shortage of workers on the mining front line.

The spirit of selflessness of coal workers is worth promoting. Their difficulties at work need to be understood and supported by society, and need to be paid attention to by the leadership.

    为了人间的温暖
    本报群众工作部信访组
    在我国，煤是最丰富的资源之一。现已探明的煤炭储量有8600亿吨，远景储量达几万亿吨。
    目前，我国能源消耗总量中，煤炭占70％以上。据专家估计，这个比例要持续二三十年。
    为唤醒那沉睡多年的宝藏，为促进国民经济的发展，全国有一支700万煤炭大军长年奋战在祖国的崇山峻岭之中。他们在艰难困苦的条件下，日夜不停地向地球开战。他们就像煤炭一样，默默地燃烧自己，照亮别人。
    根据读者来信的要求，本报群众工作部信访组的记者最近赴北京京西煤矿进行了采访。读者可以从这篇报道中，了解到煤矿工人的风貌，感受到矿山生活的气息，同时也可以体验到采掘工作的艰辛。他们的创业精神十分感人。如果我们各行各业的人们都努力发扬艰苦奋斗、顽强进取、为国分忧的精神，我们的国民经济就一定会有新的发展；我们所遇到的困难，一定会得到克服。

    学习煤矿职工的奉献精神
    编辑同志：
    共和国成立40年，也是煤炭事业大发展的40年。战斗在全国各地矿山的职工，对祖国经济的繁荣，起着举足轻重的作用。
    千米、万米深井下是他们战斗的地方，工作面仅有头顶上的小矿灯照明，四周漆黑一片都是煤，手抓的是煤，脸蹭的是煤，下班升井，脸黑得就是父亲与儿子走对面有时也互不相识。工作起来，工人们从这煤洞转入那煤洞，肩背百斤重的铁柱、木柱，手拿大板铁锹爬斜坡，8小时甚至整日不见太阳。水、火、瓦斯、煤尘与塌顶等自然灾害，威胁着他们的安全。
    煤矿工人的身躯是黑的，可献出的是火红的心，应该大力歌颂。望你们采访和报道煤矿职工的奉献精神；同时也反映他们工作中的苦恼，以便得到社会的理解和支持。
            宁夏石炭井三矿　杨树森
    读了杨树森同志的来信，我们的编辑、记者深受感动。
    为了能尽快反映出煤矿职工的风貌，记者重点采访了北京矿务局。
    采煤工作的艰险性似乎已众所周知，当我们亲临一线时，才确确实实感受到那是常人难以想象的。
    向地球开战
    大自然赐给人类的两份厚礼——新鲜的空气和温暖的阳光，采掘工人难以享受。我国露天开采的煤矿很少，采掘工人的战场主要是在阴冷、潮湿、黑暗的地下。在井下干活，有几个特点：脏。用工人略带夸张的话说，一天下来鼻子眼儿里的煤尘能攥个煤球，采煤工没有“唱白脸”的。累。据统计，每采1万吨煤，需要60立方米木材，20吨钢材，50吨水泥。由于京西煤矿煤层复杂，多属中薄型，北京矿务局的机械化采煤率只有12％，采掘工人常用的工具是电钻、电溜子、铁锨、手镐。因开采范围大，矿井延伸多，每采1万吨煤要打五六十米的岩洞。狭窄的巷道，使人干起活来难于施展。2米长、18厘米粗的木支柱只能连挟带扛地往里运，300米的巷道要做400对支柱。苦。从井口到工作面，近的数百米，远的要走个把小时。矿工穿着笨重的雨靴，经常要爬几十度的斜坡，在井下翻山越岭。走到工作面，体力消耗已很大，还要实打实地干上8小时。天长日久，腰腿疼、胃病时常袭扰着井下工人。险。随时受着水、火、瓦斯、冲击地压等自然灾害的威胁和煤尘的侵害。采掘工人是怎样看待这一切的呢？问了好几个人都是一句话：“这活是苦，是累，可总得有人干。”
    为了给社会带来光明和幸福，他们把黑暗留给了自己。面对险恶的环境，矿工们却显得那样乐观、豁达。已在井下干了30多年的王平村矿采煤三段段长王清安，用自信的口吻对记者说：“只要严格按操作规程干，安全上是有把握的。”一位来自四川的20岁的农民协议工则机智而又俏皮地反问记者：“难道井上就安全？我在井下干活没出过事，前几天骑自行车上街却把手给撞伤了。”
    艰难困苦并没有使他们畏缩不前。黑龙江省鸡西市二道河子煤矿陈德柱给本报来信说，他们矿的掘进工梁春和，在一次放炮事故中，失去了右手的三个手指。伤愈后，为了重返井下第一线，他努力锻炼用两个手指干活，几年坚持不懈。回矿后，领导上给他安排井上轻松工作他不干，硬是软磨硬泡，重新当上了掘进工。他不计报酬，用伤残的手，继续打眼、放炮、推车……
    矿工们正是以这种大无畏的精神，顽强地向地球开战，把那经过上亿年演变而成的“乌金”源源不断挖掘出来。在这寒风凛冽的冬季，不知坐在炉旁取暖的人们，可曾想到过那些在几百米深的阴冷潮湿的巷道里历尽艰辛的劳动者？
    燃烧自己　照亮别人
    在煤矿工作需要放弃多彩的城市生活，在延绵起伏的群山中安营扎寨；需要割舍儿女情长，不可能尽力去孝敬父母，辅助妻子，教育子女。矿山职工中有许多人父母去世时却看不上最后一眼，妻子生育却未能在身边守护，孩子快毕业了却没去开过家长会。为了多出煤，他们默默承受着这一切。北京矿务局抓生产的副局长梁明忠，家离单位不过几分钟的路程，可一年365天，几乎天天盯在办公室，为的是随时了解全局8个矿的生产、安全情况；局长刘少昆、党委书记张绍峰柜子里总放着方便面，因工作忙起来常吃不上饭；副总工程师张可生，逢年过节没几次与家人团聚；王平村矿矿长刘天才，星期天都在井下度过……在矿区领导中这已司空见惯。他们工作起来从没有白天黑夜。工人们也同样，加上换衣服、洗澡等辅助劳动时间，每天工作往往在10小时左右。因此，矿工的妻子工作之余，除了操持家务、侍奉老人、抚育儿女之外，还忘不了给劳累一天的丈夫做顿可口的饭菜。
    在矿山，人们还会感受到矿工母亲的博大襟怀。一位年轻采掘工一次在井下工作时不幸牺牲了，母亲在参加儿子的葬礼时，坚强地说：“他是为了社会，为了国家……”他们把儿子的骨灰埋在其为之献身的矿山上。后来，那位母亲也去世了。临终前，她要求把自己的骨灰与儿子葬在一起。于是，在那高高的山岭上，这位伟大的母亲和她那默默无闻的儿子长眠在一起。清明时节，每当这位青年矿工的父亲来为妻儿扫墓时，曾与他儿子并肩战斗的矿山伙伴们便相约而去，陪伴着英雄的父亲。
    在北京矿务局，到处可以看到抛家舍业、马不停蹄的奋进者。他们当中有些人没有领到退休证就进了八宝山。当他们燃尽自己之时，一列列满载“乌金”的列车正从矿山驶向北京、天津、河北、山东，驶向首钢、鞍钢、本钢……
    他们需要理解和支持
    煤矿职工为社会作出了巨大贡献，但他们也有苦衷。由于不少人对他们缺乏理解，以致矿山小伙子谈恋爱时只好拟定个代号厂；许多人住房困难；煤炭价格与价值的背离，使企业长年亏损，造成生产后劲不足。
    劳动力本是我国最丰富的资源之一，但煤炭行业却在这方面存在着许多问题。首先是管理和技术人员的缺乏。北京矿务局机关20多个行政处长，除3人以外，年龄都在55岁以上；全局9000多名干部，每年调出300多人，其中中专以上学历的占60％；井下许多专业技术工种，班、队、段长无人接替。其次是采掘工人招工难。目前，煤矿采掘一线约60％是农民轮换工或协议工，农民工已成为矿山建设的生力军。但随着农村生活水平的提高，煤矿招工日益困难。农民工主要靠吃议价粮生活，企业所能给予的补贴又不可能很多，致使一些煤矿的农民工大量离职出走，采掘一线严重缺员。
    煤炭职工的奉献精神值得提倡。他们工作中的苦衷需要社会上理解和支持，需要领导机关予以重视。
