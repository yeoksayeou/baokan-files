A new car surface painting technology that reduces production costs by 80 percent and increases efficiency by more than two times has been unveiled in Beijing today. This technology has passed a ministerial-level appraisal.

Developed jointly by the Chinese Printing Science and Technology Research Institute and the Beijing Travel Car Co., Ltd., this innovation is a domestic first. It uses a direct screen printing method, overcoming the long-standing issues of high labor intensity, severe pollution, and material waste associated with traditional masking and spraying techniques. The new technology offers unique designs, vibrant coatings, resistance to high and low temperatures and high humidity, and material savings.

Experts believe that this new process has wide applications, stable quality, low investment, short cycle times, easy operation, and is readily promotable, making it highly practical.

    汽车涂装新技术问世
    本报北京十二月二十八日讯　一种工艺成本降低百分之八十、工效提高两倍以上的汽车表面涂装分色新技术，今日在京通过部级鉴定。
    这项新技术由中国印刷科学技术研究所和北京旅行车股份有限公司联合研制成功，属国内首创。它采用直接丝印方式，克服了遮挡喷涂等旧工艺长期存在的劳动强度大、污染严重、原料浪费等弊病，具有形式新颖、涂层鲜艳、耐高温低温和高湿度、节约原料等优点。
    有关专家认为，这种新工艺用途广泛，质量稳定，投资少，周期短，操作方便，易于推广，具有很高的实用价值。（舒瑜）
