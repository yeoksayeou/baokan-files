Recently, scientists at the University of New South Wales in Australia have made new breakthroughs in the use of animal living tissues.

They extracted tendons from between the joints of a kangaroo's tail, processed and reshaped them, and then transplanted them between the bones of a human leg. This allowed patients with torn tendons to stand and walk again, with excellent results.

According to reports, the tail of one kangaroo can be used to transplant tendons for fifteen patients. The kangaroo, after having its tail removed, remains unharmed but loses balance and is more likely to fall while running.

Additionally, scientists from the same university successfully used ducts from cow kidneys to replace the blood vessels of coronary heart disease patients. They also used these ducts as bypass vessels in heart surgery when the patient's blood vessels were blocked, achieving better results than traditional methods.

    袋鼠尾巴奇用
    最近，澳大利亚新威尔士大学的科学家们，在利用动物活组织方面取得了新的突破。
    他们抽出袋鼠尾巴中骨节之间的腱，经加工改形后接入人腿腿骨之间，使肌腱断裂的病人重新站立、行走如初，效果特好。
    据报道，他们利用一个袋鼠的尾巴，即可为十五名病人“移植肌腱”。被截去尾巴的袋鼠也安然无恙，只是因失去了尾巴而影响了平衡，奔跑时易摔跟斗。
    另据报道，该大学的科学家还成功地以牛肾中的导管来取代冠心病患者的心血管，并在患者心血管被堵塞时代替合成纤维管作旁路心血管手术，效果也比传统办法好。
