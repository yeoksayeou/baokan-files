	It is essential to eliminate cultural garbage—obscene and vulgar books and yellow audio-visual products—for the physical and mental health of the next generation. However, the author believes that it is inappropriate to conduct "yellow" sweeps among primary school students.

	In a certain primary school, students were asked to hand in any obscene and vulgar books they had to the school, and those who did so actively would be praised. Since the teachers did not explain what "yellow books" were, the innocent and obedient students were even more confused. The next day, one little friend handed over a pile of books to the teacher. Upon opening them, the teacher found they were all children's magazines and picture books, and could not help but laugh.

	One student once seriously asked the teacher, "What is a yellow book?" "Things with naked pictures are yellow!" "What is a naked picture?" "It's when someone is not wearing clothes, just bare belly!" This caused several children to hand over their own baby photos to the teacher, leaving the teacher speechless.

	In a certain school, a girl heard the teacher talk about the significance of the "yellow" sweep and did not understand, so she asked her mother at home, "What is a yellow book?" The mother found it amusing and casually said, "Books with yellow covers are yellow books." As a result, another joke was created.

	Recently, a certain place launched a large-scale "yellow" sweep propaganda campaign, organizing primary and secondary school students to go out on the streets on weekends to expose the harm of "yellow" to young people, in order to awaken the public. But these children did not know what "yellow" sweep was, how to conduct it, or where the "yellow" source was. It is said that in a certain school, after hearing that they would go out to "sweep yellow" the next day, they thought they were going to clean the streets!

	The "yellow" sweep should not be conducted in an unrealistic manner, going through the motions, and blocking the true "yellow" sources is the key.

### 不宜在小学生中“扫黄”

    不宜在小学生中“扫黄”
    为了下一代的身心健康，清除文化垃圾——淫秽下流书刊和黄色音像制品势在必行，但笔者认为，不应在小学生中开展
  “扫黄”活动。
    某小学曾要求学生如有黄色淫秽书刊要上交学校，并谈到表现积极者将受到表扬。由于老师没有讲出“黄书”的含义，天真听话的学生心中当然更模糊，有位小朋友第二天就交给老师一大叠书刊，老师翻开一看，全是《娃娃画报》、连环画之类的图书，不禁哑然失笑。
    某学生曾十分认真地问老师：“什么是黄书？”“有裸体像的东西都是黄色的！”“啥叫裸体像？”
  “就是不穿衣服，光肚子！”这下可好，有好几位孩子先后把自己的娃娃照交给了老师，老师哭笑不得。
    某校一位女孩子听老师讲了“扫黄”的意义，左右不明白，就回家问妈妈：“啥叫黄色书籍？”当妈妈的觉得可笑，就信口道：“书皮是黄颜色的就是黄书”。结果又闹出了笑话。
    最近，某地开展了大规模“扫黄”宣传，组织中小学生星期天走上街头，揭露“黄祸”对青少年的危害，以引起世人清醒。但这些孩子压根儿就不知道什么叫“扫黄”、怎么“扫黄”、“黄源”在哪里。据说，某校听说明天要上街“扫黄”，还以为要上街打扫“卫生”呢？
    “扫黄”不能不切实际地搞形式，走过场，堵住真正的“黄源”才是关键中的关键。
