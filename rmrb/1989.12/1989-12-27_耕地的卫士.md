To protect farmland, Wuxiang County in our province organized an inspection team consisting of departments such as public security, finance, and land. To date, they have investigated 1,777 cases of illegal land occupation, including 162 officials at various levels; reclaimed 49,000 square meters of land, and fined 136,000 yuan.

First, investigate officials. The main resistance to investigating illegal land occupation comes from some leading officials who abuse their power for personal gain. Whenever the inspection team arrives at a place, they first investigate the officials who have illegally occupied land. The director of a state-owned factory in Chengguan Village built a house and illegally occupied one mu of land, and should be fined 186 yuan, but he completely ignored the notice from the inspection team. The inspection team went to his door to do work, making him change his attitude and voluntarily paid the fine. The 24 cases of illegal land occupation in the entire village were quickly resolved. The inspection team in Hongshui Town punished seven officials who illegally occupied and exceeded the land for building houses according to regulations.

Remove the "nail households." Known as the "tyrant" of Hongshui Street, Hu's five rooms facing the street are illegal constructions that affect the street planning. Last winter, the inspection team took measures to forcibly demolish his illegal constructions, removing the "nail household" on this street.

Iron-faced and impartial. The comrades of the inspection team are strict with themselves, iron-faced and impartial, treating relatives and friends equally, using one ruler to measure and one standard to punish. Inspection team member Wei Aiguo built a house and illegally occupied 20 square meters of land, and he voluntarily paid the fine and returned the land. Team member Li Aijun did not show favoritism to his two sisters and one uncle, and collected fines according to regulations. Everywhere the inspection team goes, they refuse to accept meals and gifts. According to statistics, the inspection team members have refused gifts more than 50 times.

    耕地的卫士
    我省武乡县为保护耕地，组织了由政法、财政、土地等部门参加的清查队，至今，他们已查处了违法占地者1777户，其中有各级干部162人；收回土地4.9万平方米，罚款13.6万多元。
    先查干部。查处违法占地的阻力主要来自一些以权谋私的领导干部。清查队员每到一处，便先查违法占地的干部。有个国营厂的厂长，在城关村建房超占地一分，应罚款186元，但他对清查组的通知根本不理睬。清查人员就上门做工作，使他改变了态度，主动交了罚款。全村24户违法占地案件很快得到处理。洪水镇清查组对7名乱占超占土地建房的干部，全部按规定作了处罚。
    拔“钉子户”。号称洪水街上“一霸”的胡某，临街的5间房属违法建筑，影响街道规划。去年冬天，清查组采取措施，强行拆除其违法建筑，拔掉了这条街上的“钉子户”。
    铁面无私。清查组的同志严于律己，铁面无私，亲戚朋友一视同仁，一把尺子丈量，一个标准处罚。清查队员魏爱国建房超占20平方米，他主动交款退地。队员李爱军对两个姐姐、一个舅舅的查处不留情面，按规定收了罚款。清查队员每到一处，都拒请吃送礼，据统计，清查队员先后拒礼50多人次。
