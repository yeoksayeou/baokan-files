Panama Continues to Be in a State of Chaos

Until tonight, more than 90 hours after the barbaric invasion of Panama by U.S. forces, the country remains in a state of chaos and anarchy. People's lives and property are not protected, and there is no recourse for those who have been robbed or stolen from.

Panama City is in ruins, with shattered glass and destroyed iron doors littering the streets. It is estimated that more than 70% of the city's shops have been looted since the U.S. invasion, including some well-known supermarkets. The looters are mostly unemployed vagabonds and hoodlums.

Additionally, the invading U.S. forces are still hunting for Panama's military commander, Manuel Noriega, and there are occasional small-scale skirmishes between troops and militias loyal to Noriega and the invading U.S. forces.

However, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command claimed today that the U.S. military has completely controlled the situation in Panama, and their current mission is to capture Noriega.

Since the U.S. military invaded Panama in the early hours of December 20th, Panama City has been in a state of severe chaos, with looting rampant, even at the presidential palace.

After the U.S. military occupied Panama City, the presidential palace has been deserted, with no one working there. Some locals looted this office building on December 21st and 22nd. According to eyewitnesses, one looter even carried off the president's chair.

It is reported that the Supreme Court of Panama, the Cultural Association, and the French Embassy, all located near the presidential palace, have also been looted.

    巴拿马继续处于混乱状态
    新华社巴拿马城12月23日电　直至今晚，即美军野蛮入侵巴拿马之后90多个小时，巴拿马仍处于混乱和无政府状态之中。人们的生命财产得不到保护，遭受抢劫、偷盗也无处申诉。
    巴拿马城满目疮痍，大街上到处都是碎玻璃和被捣毁的铁门。据估计，美军入侵之后，该城70％以上的商店遭到抢劫，其中包括一些有名的超级市场。抢劫者都是一些无业游民和地痞流氓。
    此外，入侵美军还在继续搜捕巴拿马国防军司令诺列加，有时还发生忠于诺列加的部队和民兵同入侵美军之间的小规模冲突。
    然而，美军南方司令部发言人今天宣称，美军已完全控制了巴拿马的局势，现在的任务是抓获诺列加。
    新华社巴拿马城12月23日电　自美军20日凌晨入侵巴拿马之后，巴拿马城处于严重混乱状态，抢劫成风，连总统府也遭洗劫。
    美军占领巴拿马城之后，总统府一直没有人办公，一些当地人21日和22日连续两天洗劫这座办公大楼。据目击者说，一名抢劫者把总统坐椅也扛走了。
    据悉，邻近总统府的巴最高法院、文化协会和法国大使馆也被抢劫。
