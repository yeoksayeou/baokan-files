In recent years, economic friction between the United States and Japan has been frequent, sometimes even reaching a state of high tension. However, apart from the 100% punitive tariffs imposed by the U.S. on certain Japanese electronic products in 1987 and the sanctions against Toshiba, other disputes have generally been resolved through mutual compromise and concessions. This is undoubtedly related to the mutual economic dependence and shared strategic interests of the two countries. On the other hand, Japan's extensive lobbying activities in the United States have also played a significant role.

In the United States, lobbying activities primarily refer to various interest groups hiring influential lobbyists to persuade members of Congress and government officials to consider their interests during legislation and decision-making. There are tens of thousands of specialized lobbying groups in the U.S., and the number of professional lobbyists is countless.

It is said that over 250 Japanese companies, industrial associations, and government agencies employ lobbyists in the United States, with annual lobbying expenses ranging from $60 million to $100 million. In addition to direct lobbying activities, *Business Week* estimates that Japan's public relations expenses, funding for research institutions, and other similar expenditures in the United States amount to over $200 million. *The New York Times* also revealed that 80% of the research projects related to U.S.-Japan relations at various American universities and research institutions receive varying degrees of funding from Japanese companies, foundations, or the government. Apart from being generous with money, the lobbyists hired by the Japanese in the United States are mostly former members of Congress and former high-ranking government officials, as these individuals have networks in the legislative and enforcement departments and their words carry weight. These lobbyists also act as the "eyes and ears" of the Japanese, so Japan is relatively well-informed about matters related to it within the U.S. government. A mid-level official from the Department of Commerce complained that often, before a decision reaches his level, the lobbyists hired by Japan already know about it.

Japan's lobbying activities have sparked dissatisfaction among many Americans. The American lobbyists who are hired have also faced criticism, but they defend themselves by saying that what they do is to facilitate bilateral positions, increase understanding, reduce conflicts, and it is beneficial to American consumers.

    日本在美国的院外活动
    本报记者　张亮
    近年来美日之间的经济摩擦此伏彼起；有时甚至闹到剑拔弩张的地步。但是，除1987年美国对日本部分电子产品实施100％的惩罚性关税和制裁东芝公司外，其它纠纷往往以相互妥协让步而了结。这诚然与两国经济相互依赖及共同的战略利益有关，另一方面日本在美国大力开展院外活动也起了不小的作用。
    在美国，院外活动主要是指各利益集团雇佣有影响力的说客，对国会议员和政府官员游说，促使他们在立法和决策时能照顾其利益。美国有成千上万个专门从事这种游说活动的院外集团，而职业说客更是不计其数。
    据说，250多个日本公司、工业协会和政府机构在美国雇佣说客，每年的院外活动费为6000万至1亿美元。除直接进行院外活动外，《商业周刊》估计日本在美国的公共关系费用、向研究机构的资助及其它类似开支达2亿多美元。《纽约时报》还透露，美国各大学和研究机构有关美日关系的研究项目中，80％都程度不同地接受日本公司、基金会或政府的资助。除舍得花大钱外，日本人在美国雇佣的说客大多是前国会议员和前政府高级官员，因为这些人在立法和执法部门有关系网，说话有影响力。这批说客还充当日本人的“耳目”，因而日本对美国政府内部与日本有关的事务比较知情。商务部一位中级官员就抱怨说，常常当一项决策还未传达到他那一级时，日本雇佣的说客就知道了。
    日本人的院外活动已引起了许多美国人的不满。受雇的美国说客也遭到批评，但他们辩护说，他们所做的只是疏通双边立场，以增进了解，缩小冲突，对美国消费者也是有利的。
