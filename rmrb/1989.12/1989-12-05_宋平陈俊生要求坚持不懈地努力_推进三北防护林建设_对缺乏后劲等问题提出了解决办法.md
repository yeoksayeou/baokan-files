    Song Ping and Chen Junsheng today praised the builders of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Project for their silent dedication. He said that creating forests and greening in extremely harsh conditions, especially in sparsely populated desert areas, is a great cause for improving the ecological environment and benefiting future generations. He suggested erecting monuments, writing biographies, and sculpting statues for those with outstanding merits, using their selfless dedication to educate and inspire the masses.

    Song Ping said at the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction Work Conference held today that the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Project has achieved remarkable results after more than ten years of construction and is undoubtedly the "world's largest ecological engineering project." He urged all levels of leadership to attach great importance to this project, which is related to the prosperity of the country, the flourishing of the nation, and human survival, to establish a long-term construction mindset, overcome difficulties, and persist in completing the glorious mission entrusted by the Party and the people.

    The main purpose of this Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction Work Conference is to study some urgent problems that have arisen in the new situation of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction, so as to push this project, which is related to the ecological environment of half of China's territory, to a new stage of sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

    The Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Project, which spans the northwest, north, and northeast of China, includes 13 provinces and 551 counties, with a total area of 4.069 million square kilometers, accounting for 42.4% of the national territory. Over the past 12 years, 137 million mu of artificial forestation has been completed, and the forest coverage rate has increased from 5.05% to 7.09%, achieving significant ecological benefits. In some places, the phenomena of wind erosion, desertification, and salinization have been initially improved.

    Song Ping, who once served as the head of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction Leading Group, emphasized that the later stages of the project will be even more challenging, and it is even more necessary for all levels of leadership to pay high attention and further mobilize the masses. He made clear requirements on the economic policies, funding input, and technological development of this project.

    The main problems facing the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction at present are: in recent years, the area of seedling cultivation and afforestation has shown a downward trend and has not fully met the planned requirements; forest pests and rodent damage are severe, with an affected area of about 10 million mu; young and middle-aged forests have not been timely managed and nurtured, and the forest quality is not high.

    Regarding the lack of momentum in the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction, State Councilor Chen Junsheng pointed out at today's meeting that it should be seriously solved with a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people. He said that to adapt to the great systematic project of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction, a set of policies and supporting measures are needed. The Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction is a project with ecological benefits as the main focus and also with economic benefits. Relying on policies becomes more prominent and important. In the future, those that reflect social and ecological benefits should gradually implement corresponding compensation measures. Chen Junsheng urged that this project should be funded through multiple levels and channels, with the state, local governments, collectives, individuals, and relevant industries all increasing their investment in the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction. The financial input of the provincial, municipal, and county governments should not be lower than the level of 1984, and it should rely on science and technology to promote forestation.

    Chen Junsheng pointed out that agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry should be given equal importance, and leadership should be strengthened to emphasize practical work. One government should do its work for the next government to see, and one generation should continue the work of the previous generation. Short-term behavior should be overcome, and a "relay race" should be implemented, rather than "one general, one order," with tight and loose, stop-and-go work.

    Minister of Forestry Gao Dezhan presided over the meeting and introduced the progress of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction. The deputy governors and forestry bureau directors of the 13 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the Three-North region, as well as the responsible persons of relevant central departments, attended today's meeting.

    宋平陈俊生要求坚持不懈地努力
    推进三北防护林建设
    对缺乏后劲等问题提出了解决办法
    本报北京12月4日讯　新华社记者张建军、杜笑岩、本报记者高保生报道：中共中央政治局常委宋平今天高度赞扬为三北防护林工程默默奉献的建设者们。他说，在非常艰苦的条件下，特别是在人烟稀少的荒漠地区造林绿化，是一项治理生态环境、造福子孙后代的伟大事业。他建议为功勋卓著者树碑、立传、塑像，用他们的无私奉献精神教育和激励广大群众。
    宋平在今天召开的三北防护林建设工作会议上说，三北防护林工程经过十多年建设，已取得了举世瞩目的成就，作为“世界生态工程之最”是当之无愧的。他要求各级领导高度重视这项关系到国家富强、民族昌盛和人类生存的重要工程，树立长期建设的思想，克服困难，坚持不懈地完成党和人民交给我们的光荣任务。
    这次三北防护林建设工作会议，主要研究三北防护林建设在新形势下出现的一些亟待解决的问题，以把这项关系到我国半壁河山生态环境的工程推向持续、稳定、协调发展的新阶段。
    横跨我国西北、华北、东北的三北防护林工程，包括13个省的551个县，总面积406.9万平方公里，占国土面积的42.4％。12年来已完成人工造林1.37亿亩，森林覆盖率由5.05％提高到7.09％，取得明显生态效益，一些地方风化、沙化、盐碱化现象得到初步改观。
    曾担任三北防护林建设领导小组组长的宋平同志强调指出，工程越到后期，条件就越艰苦，越需要引起各级领导的高度重视，并进一步深入发动群众。他就此项工程的经济政策、资金投入和科技兴林等方面提出了明确的要求。
    三北防护林建设目前面临的主要问题是：近年来育苗和造林面积出现滑坡趋势，没有完全达到规划要求；林木病虫鼠害严重，受害面积约1000万亩；中幼林没能及时进行抚育管理，林分质量不高。
    对于三北防护林建设缺乏后劲问题，国务委员陈俊生在今天的会议上指出，要以对党和人民事业高度负责的精神认真加以解决。他说，适应三北防护林建设这一伟大系统工程，要有一整套政策和配套措施。三北防护林建设是以生态效益为主、也有经济效益的工程，依靠政策显得更加突出，更加重要。今后，凡体现社会效益和生态效益的，应逐步实行相应的补偿措施。陈俊生要求对这项工程实行多层次、多渠道资金投入，国家、地方、集体、个人和有关的各行各业都要增加对三北防护林建设的投入，省、地、县三级财政的投入要不低于1984年的水平，并要依靠科技兴林。
    陈俊生指出，要把农林牧放在同等地位，切实加强领导，讲究真抓实干。一届政府做给一届政府看，一代接着一代干。要克服短期行为，实行“接力赛”，不要“一个将军一道令”，时紧时松，干干停停。
    林业部部长高德占主持会议，并介绍了三北防护林建设的进展情况。三北地区13个省、市、自治区的主管副省长及林业厅局长，中央有关部门的负责人参加了今天的会议。
