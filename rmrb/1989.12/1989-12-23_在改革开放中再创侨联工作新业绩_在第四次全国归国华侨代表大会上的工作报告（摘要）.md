Edition: 3

The Third Session of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (hereinafter referred to as "southern committee") began its work when the rectification of wrongs in the overseas Chinese affairs sector was basically completed, and the country's reform and opening-up were gradually developing. Over the past five years, it has been a period of rapid development and gradual improvement of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations, a period of extensive service to returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese, a period of active participation of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in the modernization construction of the motherland, and a period of promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and us.

1. Overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have been developed and strengthened

At present, in coastal key overseas Chinese hometowns, from cities to towns, various organizations have initially formed a network. Overseas Chinese affairs organizations in inland and border minority areas have been established and developed one after another. In departments, schools, factories, farms, and other places where there are many returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese affairs organizations have been established one after another. The number of overseas Chinese affairs organizations at the county level and above in the country has increased from more than 400 in 1984 to more than 2,700. There are more than 8,000 overseas Chinese affairs organizations and their affiliated associations at all levels in the country.

While the grassroots organizations are developing rapidly, many local overseas Chinese affairs organizations also pay attention to strengthening their own construction. Many local overseas Chinese affairs organizations support the development of various associations organized by returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, and through them, further strengthen the contact with returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, and strengthen the contact with overseas Chinese and their associations. The establishment and development of overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels, and the replenishment and strengthening of the overseas Chinese affairs cadres team have enhanced the cohesion and vitality of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations, creating the necessary conditions for the development of various works.

2. The liaison work of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations has made new progress

The overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have extensively carried out mass liaison activities at home and abroad and achieved new progress, mainly in three aspects:

First, many overseas Chinese affairs organizations have taken various forms to actively carry out liaison activities, expanding the social influence of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations. At the same time, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and local overseas Chinese affairs organizations have gone deep into the grassroots, conducted investigations and research, listened to the voices of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, cared for their sufferings, reflected and promoted the solution of their difficulties, and strengthened the relationship between the overseas Chinese affairs organizations and the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese.

Second, on the basis of doing a good job in domestic liaison work, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have actively carried out foreign liaison work. The overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels pay attention to "focusing on the domestic and facing the overseas," and through the "thousands of households" of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese at home, contact and unite the "thousands of households" of relatives overseas, further promoting the development of foreign liaison activities.

Third, many overseas Chinese affairs organizations have begun to pay attention to carrying out liaison work with cultural and economic exchanges and cooperation as the actual content. The Chinese Overseas History Society has developed significantly in the past few years. So far, 27 Chinese Overseas History Societies have been established in various parts of the country.

3. The work of safeguarding the rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese has achieved results

Over the past five years, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have gone deep into the grassroots and the masses, conducted investigations and research, and actively and actively reflected the opinions and demands of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese to the relevant departments, assisted the relevant parties to implement the overseas Chinese affairs policies, and helped a large number of overseas Chinese houses that were wrongly seized, reformed, and occupied to be returned; a number of historical cases of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese before the Cultural Revolution have been reviewed and corrected; many returned overseas Chinese cadres, intellectuals, and returned overseas Chinese youth who were wrongly demoted and sent down to the countryside have been reinstated or returned to the city for employment, and their families have been properly arranged.

With the continuous improvement of the country's legal system, the use of legal means to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese in the country has been increasingly valued by the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels. After the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Organization, Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Hangzhou, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Shantou, Meizhou, Kaiping, Shenzhen, and other places have also established legal institutions one after another, providing warm legal consultations and services for returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots. In the past five years, the legal service institutions of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations have received and handled more than 240,000 visits and letters, provided legal consultations for more than 2,000 people, handled more than 2,000 lawsuits, recovered economic losses of more than 700 million yuan, and were appointed as legal advisors for more than 70 enterprises and institutions for the year.

The overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels care for the sufferings of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese and have done a lot of practical and good things for them.

4. Played an active role in the socialist construction of the motherland

In recent years, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have striven to carry out liaison work and promote the vast number of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese to play an active role in the modernization construction of the motherland.

In serving economic construction, we have made full use of the advantage of having many overseas relationships, actively assisted the relevant parties to introduce funds, technology, equipment, and talents, and striven to promote economic exchanges and cooperation between the mainland of China and overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots. Since the reform and opening-up, the foreign capital directly or indirectly introduced by local overseas Chinese affairs organizations has reached more than 30 billion US dollars, of which the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have directly introduced more than 2 billion US dollars of foreign capital to establish and support enterprises. More than 80% of the foreign capital projects introduced in the coastal cities and towns of Guangdong and Fujian are overseas Chinese capital or foreign capital introduced through overseas Chinese, and more than 80% of them have overseas Chinese affairs organizations participating in or coordinating the "needlework" work.

Overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese have enthusiastically supported the construction of their hometowns. In the past five years, they have donated money and materials totaling more than 4.6 billion yuan. The overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have assisted the relevant departments in doing a large amount of specific work to implement the donation projects, promoting the construction of overseas Chinese hometowns.

Supporting returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to establish overseas Chinese enterprises and doing a good job in the enterprises affiliated to the overseas Chinese affairs organizations is an important channel for the overseas Chinese affairs organizations to serve economic construction.

In recent years, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels and the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese have cared for national affairs, participated in politics, and actively participated in the construction of socialist democracy and legal system. At present, there are more than 20,000 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese representatives and members in the people's congresses and political consultative conferences at all levels in the country. They have seriously expressed their opinions on national affairs and have been valued by the party and the government.

Spiritual civilization construction is an important part of China's modernization construction. In recent years, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels have actively cooperated with the relevant departments to carry out various forms of current affairs education, professional ethics education, legal education, and "five lectures, four beauties, three loves" activities, promoting the activities of changing customs in overseas Chinese hometowns, and have made active contributions in eliminating feudal superstitions, thrifty weddings and funerals, mediating disputes, and activating rural cultural life, improving sanitation conditions, and changing social customs.

Future Work Prospects

In the future, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations will shoulder a glorious mission and also face many difficulties. Below, we propose a few ideas for the future work of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations:

Safeguarding the rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese in accordance with the law

Serving returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese wholeheartedly and safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests in the country is the starting point and foothold of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations. Although the work of implementing overseas Chinese affairs policies has been basically completed, the handling of the remaining problems still requires tremendous efforts. We must continue to assist the relevant departments to complete this work from beginning to end.

With the continuous improvement of China's socialist legal system, legal means will become the main weapon for us to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese in the country. At present, less than 1/4 of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at the provincial level and above have established legal consultation institutions. In the future, the overseas Chinese affairs organizations in all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans should, according to their needs and conditions, establish their own legal consultation institutions, and pay attention to studying the new situations and problems that may arise in the new situation of infringing upon the rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese in the country.

The overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels should actively participate in politics, participate in the political consultation and democratic supervision of national affairs, fully express the opinions and demands of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese, and assist the party and the government in eliminating corruption and promoting clean governance.

Making full use of the advantages of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations to better serve economic construction

The work of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations to serve economic construction mainly has the following three aspects:

First, vigorously assist the relevant departments to introduce funds, technology, equipment, management talents, etc., assist in the development of "three types of enterprises" and "three-in-one and one-compensated enterprises," and open up the international market. This is an important aspect of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations serving economic construction. The overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels should actively publicize to overseas Chinese that China's policies of reform and opening-up will not change, help them eliminate doubts, and strengthen their confidence. We should pay attention to implementing the principle of equality and mutual benefit and actively reflect to the relevant parties the problems existing in the production and operation of overseas Chinese and foreign-invested enterprises, as well as their reasonable opinions and demands, and assist the relevant parties in creating a good investment environment.

Second, actively support and guide returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to establish enterprises. This is a big deal related to the vital interests of thousands of households of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese.

Third, seriously implement the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on further cleaning up and rectifying companies, and according to the characteristics of the overseas Chinese affairs organizations, do a good job in the enterprises affiliated to the overseas Chinese affairs organizations at all levels, and pay attention to guiding the development of production-type, technological development-type, outward-looking, and consulting service-type enterprises.

Strengthening liaison work and further promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and overseas

Strengthening liaison work, first of all, we should focus on the domestic. We should strengthen contact with 30 million returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese through various means, give them more care and help in terms of ideology, work, and life, and unite them more closely to strive for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and create conditions for better carrying out overseas liaison activities.

Local overseas Chinese affairs organizations should do a good job in reception work, warmly serve overseas Chinese who come back to visit relatives, travel, seek roots, study, seek medical treatment, and cooperate and exchange, so that they can feel the warmth of their relatives in the motherland.

The great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland has always been of concern to returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have close contact with Taiwan. We should, through them and their relatives on the mainland, further communicate between the mainland and Taiwan, increase mutual understanding between the people on both sides of the strait, and contribute to the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    在改革开放中再创侨联工作新业绩
    ——在第四次全国归国华侨代表大会上的工作报告（摘要）
    张国基
    五年工作的回顾
    全国侨联第三届委员会是在侨务战线拨乱反正工作基本完成，国家的改革、开放逐步发展的形势下开始工作的。过去的5年，是侨联组织日益发展、逐步健全的5年，是各级侨联广泛开展为归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞服务的5年，是侨联团结广大归侨、侨眷积极参加祖国社会主义现代化建设的5年，也是侨联努力促进海外侨胞、港澳台同胞与我们进行经济、文化交流与合作的5年。
    一、各级侨联组织得到了发展和加强
    目前，沿海的重点侨乡，从城市到乡、镇，各级组织已初步形成网络。内地和边疆少数民族地区的侨联组织相继建立和发展。在归侨、侨眷较多的机关、院校、厂矿、农场等也纷纷成立了侨联组织。全国县级以上侨联机构已由1984年时的400多个发展到2700多个，全国各级侨联组织及其所属社团已达8000多个。
    在基层组织迅速发展的同时，许多地方的侨联也重视加强自身建设。不少地方侨联支持归侨、侨眷组织的各种社团的发展，通过它们进一步密切同归侨、侨眷的联系，并加强同海外侨胞及其社团的联系。各级侨联组织的建立和发展，侨联干部队伍的充实和加强，增强了侨联的凝聚力和活力，为各项工作的开展创造了必要的条件。
    二、侨联的联络工作有了新的进展
    各级侨联广泛开展国内外的群众性联谊活动并取得了新的进展，主要表现在三个方面：
    一是许多侨联组织采取各种方式，积极开展联谊活动，扩大了侨联的社会影响。同时全国侨联和地方侨联深入基层，调查研究，倾听广大归侨、侨眷的呼声，关心他们的疾苦，反映并推动解决他们的困难，密切了侨联与广大归侨、侨眷的关系。
    二是各级侨联在做好国内联络工作的基础上，积极开展对外联络工作。各级侨联注意“立足国内、面向海外”，通过国内“千家万户”的归侨、侨眷联系和团结海外“千家万户”的亲人，进一步推动了外联活动的开展。
    三是许多侨联开始注意以文化经济的交流与合作为实际内容开展联络工作。华侨历史学会几年来有了较大的发展，到目前为止，全国各地已成立华侨历史学会27个。
    三、维护归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞权益的工作取得成效
    5年来，各级侨联深入基层、深入群众，调查研究，认真做好信访工作，积极主动地向有关部门反映归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞的意见、要求，协助有关方面落实侨务政策，使大批被错误没收、改造、挤占的侨房得以清退；一批归侨、侨眷“文革”前的历史旧案得以复查纠正；许多被错误精简下放的归侨干部、知识分子、下乡归侨知识青年得以复职或回城就业，他们的家属也得到妥善安置。
    随着国家法制的不断健全，运用法律手段维护归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞在国内的合法权益已日益受到各级侨联的重视。继全国侨联和广东省侨联之后，北京、上海、湖北、辽宁、黑龙江、福建及杭州、宁波、广州、汕头、梅州、开平、深圳等地侨联也先后设立了法律机构，热情为归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞、港澳台同胞提供法律咨询与服务。5年来侨联的法律服务机构共接待来访和处理来信24万多人次，提供法律咨询2000多人次，办理诉讼2000多件，追回经济损失7000多万元，并受聘担任70多家企业、事业单位的当年法律顾问。
    各级侨联关心广大归侨、侨眷的疾苦，为他们办了大量实事、好事。
    四、在祖国社会主义建设中发挥了积极作用
    几年来，各级侨联努力开展联络工作，促进广大归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞在祖国的现代化建设中发挥积极作用。
    在为经济建设服务方面，我们发挥海外关系众多的优势，积极协助各有关方面引进资金、技术、设备和人才，努力推动中国大陆与海外侨胞、港澳台同胞的经济交流与合作。改革开放以来，各地侨联直接或间接引进的外资已达30多亿美元，其中各级侨联兴办、扶持的企业直接引进外资2亿多美元。广东、福建沿海城乡引进的外资项目中，80％以上是侨资或通过侨胞引进的外资，而其中80％以上都有侨联参与或配合做“穿针引线”工作。
    海外华侨、华人及港澳台同胞热情支援家乡建设，5年来，捐赠钱物折合人民币46亿多元。各级侨联协助有关部门对捐赠项目做了大量具体的落实工作，促进了侨乡建设。
    扶持归侨、侨眷兴办侨属企业和办好侨联所属企业，是侨联为经济建设服务的重要渠道。
    几年来，各级侨联和广大归侨、侨眷关心国家大事，参政议政，积极参加社会主义民主与法制建设。目前，全国各级人大、政协中的归侨、侨眷代表和委员共计2万多人，他们对国家大事认真发表意见，受到党和政府的重视。
    精神文明建设是我国现代化建设的重要组成部分。几年来，各级侨联积极配合有关部门开展多种形式的时事教育、职业道德教育、法制教育和“五讲四美三热爱”活动，推动侨乡移风易俗活动的开展，在破除封建迷信、勤俭办婚丧喜庆、调解纠纷和活跃乡村文化生活、改善卫生条件、改变社会风气等方面做出了积极的贡献。
          今后工作的设想
    今后，侨联肩负着光荣的使命，也面临着许多困难。下面，我们对今后侨联的工作提出几点设想：
    依法维护归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞的权益
    热情为归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞服务，切实维护他们在国内的合法权益是侨联工作的出发点和落脚点。目前落实侨务政策的工作虽已基本完成，但遗留问题的处理仍要付出艰巨的努力，要继续协助有关部门善始善终地完成这一工作。
    随着我国社会主义法制的日益健全，法律手段将成为我们维护归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞在国内合法权益的主要武器。目前，省级以上侨联设立法律咨询机构的尚不足1／4。今后，各省、自治区、直辖市侨联和计划单列市侨联都应根据需要和条件，设立自己的法律咨询机构，并注意研究在新形势下可能出现的侵犯归侨、侨眷权益和海外侨胞在国内合法权益的新情况、新问题。
    各级侨联要积极参政议政，参与国家事务的政治协商、民主监督，充分表达归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞的意见与要求，协助党和政府清除腐败，搞好廉政建设。
    发挥侨联的优势，更好地为经济建设服务
    侨联为经济建设服务的工作，主要有以下三个方面：
    一是大力协助有关部门引进资金、技术、设备、管理人才等，协助发展“三资”企业和“三来一补”企业，开拓国际市场，这是侨联为经济建设服务的重要方面。各级侨联要积极向海外侨胞宣传我国改革、开放的方针政策不变，帮助他们消除疑虑，增强信心。要注意贯彻平等互利的原则，并积极向有关方面反映侨、外商投资企业在生产、经营方面存在的问题以及他们的合理意见和要求，协助有关方面创造良好的投资环境。
    二是积极扶持和指导归侨、侨眷兴办企业。这是关系到千家万户归侨、侨眷切身利益的大事情。
    三是认真贯彻中共中央、国务院关于进一步清理整顿公司的精神，根据侨联的特点办好各级侨联所属的企业，并注意引导发展生产型、科技开发型、外向型、咨询服务型的企业。
    大力加强联络工作，进一步促进海内外经济、文化的交流与合作
    加强联络工作，首先要立足国内。要通过各种方式加强同3000万归侨、侨眷的联系，从思想上、工作上、生活上给予他们更多的关心和帮助，更紧密地团结他们为建设有中国特色的社会主义而共同奋斗，为更好地开展海外联络活动创造条件。
    各地侨联要搞好接待工作，热情为回来探亲、旅游、寻根问祖、求学就医、合作交流的侨胞服务，使他们感受到祖国亲人的温暖。
    祖国和平统一大业历来为归侨、侨眷和海外侨胞所关注，不少海外侨胞和港澳同胞与台湾有着密切的往来，我们要通过他们及其在大陆的亲属进一步沟通大陆与台湾的联系、增进海峡两岸人民的相互了解，为促进祖国和平统一大业作出贡献。
