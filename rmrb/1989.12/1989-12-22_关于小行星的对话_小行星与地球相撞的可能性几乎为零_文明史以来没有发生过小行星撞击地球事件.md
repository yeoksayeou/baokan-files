On December 14, many newspapers published the shocking news that "an asteroid might collide with Earth," causing widespread concern among readers. It was not until the evening of the 14th to the 15th that Central Television and some newspapers issued corrections, which finally put everyone's minds at ease. "Asteroids" have become a hot topic in recent days. How many asteroids are there in the solar system? Have asteroids ever collided with Earth? Do we have ways to avoid such "celestial disasters"? With great interest, reporters visited the Beijing Astronomical Observatory to hear the astronomers' many enlightening views.

	Reporter: We would like to know the history and current state of human understanding of asteroids.
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: On New Year's Day in 1801, the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, based on the Titius-Bode law, discovered the asteroid Ceres between Mars and Jupiter. This was the first asteroid discovered by humans. Since then, other asteroids have been discovered. So far, nearly 6,000 asteroids have been observed. Among these, the orbits of approximately 3,000 have been calculated. In fact, the history of human understanding of asteroids is nearly 200 years old.

	Reporter: What is the likelihood of an asteroid colliding with Earth?
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: The probability of an asteroid colliding with Earth is almost zero. We believe there are four reasons to support this view. 1. Asteroids and the nine major planets of the solar system all orbit the Sun in their respective elliptical orbits, and their orbits do not intersect in space. 2. Most asteroids are located in space 300 million to 400 million kilometers away from Earth. 3. Even if we concede that there might be intersection points between the orbits of some asteroids (this possibility is also extremely rare), these asteroids would not have the possibility of passing through the intersection point at the same time. Therefore, this possibility is almost non-existent. 4. According to statistical laws, the probability of an asteroid approaching or colliding with Earth is only 2 to 3 times every 100,000 years, but this does not mean it will definitely collide with Earth.

	Reporter: Has there ever been an asteroid collision with Earth in history?
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: At least we can say that since the dawn of civilization, such an event has not occurred. Moreover, to date, no asteroid has been found to have entered the Moon-Earth orbit.

	Reporter: Then, the meteorites that fall to Earth are originally meteoroids in the universe?
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: Yes. In addition to planets, asteroids, satellites, and comets, the solar system also contains a vast number of small solid bodies and dust particles, collectively known as meteoroids. Meteoroids range in size from micrometers to meters, and they all orbit the Sun. When Earth orbits the Sun, it often encounters meteoroids. The meteors we see are meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at altitudes between 120 kilometers and 78 kilometers, where they collide with atmospheric molecules, generating heat and emitting light. If the meteoroid's trajectory forms a large angle with the ground, it will fall to the surface and become a meteorite.

	Meteoroids are numerous and countless, whereas asteroids are different. Asteroids generally have diameters of 1 kilometer to several tens of kilometers. Asteroids with diameters greater than 100 kilometers have only been discovered 10 times, and the possibility of these asteroids colliding with Earth is almost zero.

	Reporter: If an asteroid were to collide with Earth, what kind of damage would it cause? With current scientific and technological capabilities, can humans take measures to avoid such a collision?
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: We have reason to say that the probability of an asteroid colliding with Earth is almost zero. As for how humans can avoid asteroid collisions with Earth and the extent of the damage, these are issues of concern to geophysicists.

	Reporter: Have there been any asteroids discovered recently that are relatively close to Earth? What research value do they have?
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: In March 1989, an asteroid relatively close to Earth was discovered and named "1989FC." On March 23, this asteroid flew past Earth at a distance of 750,000 kilometers. It is now 200 million kilometers away from us and will not pose a threat to Earth. The study of such near-Earth asteroids is currently a frontier topic in international astronomy. Monitoring their movements and orbital laws, especially their physical properties, is of great importance. Scientists believe that if an asteroid is metallic, it would mean it is a high-grade ore deposit, with some reaching tens of billions of tons, making it a precious cosmic resource. If one day humans truly want to harness asteroids, facing such wealth, they would surely sigh that asteroids are too far away from us.

	Reporter: What kind of cooperation and information exchange does the international astronomical community have in the study of asteroids?
	Beijing Astronomical Observatory: Internationally, there is a recognized asteroid research center, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the United States. This is the most authoritative institution in the world for the collection of asteroid data, orbital calculations, and information dissemination. The Planetary Research Room at the Purple Mountain Observatory is China's authoritative institution for asteroid research, maintaining business exchanges and information communication with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

    关于小行星的对话
    小行星与地球相撞的可能性几乎为零
　  文明史以来没有发生过小行星撞击地球事件
    王直华　刘慧辰
    12月14日，许多报纸刊出了“一颗小行星可能撞击地球”的惊人新闻，引起了广大读者的不安，直到14日晚至15日中央电视台和一些报纸发出消息予以更正，才使大家松了一口气。“小行星”已成为近日的热门话题。太阳系共有多少颗小行星？小行星撞上过地球吗？我们有办法避免这种“天祸”吗？记者怀着极大的兴趣来到北京天文台，听到天文学家们许多富于启发性的见解。
    记者：很想了解人类关于小行星研究认识的历史和现状是怎样的？
    天文台：1801年元旦意大利天文学家根据提出斯波德定则测算，找到了位于火星和木星之间的小行星——谷神星，这是人类发现的第一颗小行星。此后又陆续找到了其它小行星。到目前为止，观测到的小行星已近6000颗。其中已测算出运行轨道的大约有3000颗左右。算起来，人类对小行星认识的历史已有近200年了。
    记者：小行星与地球相撞的可能性如何？
    天文台：小行星与地球相撞的可能性几乎为零。我们认为有四点理由可证明这一观点。1、小行星与太阳系九大行星都在各自的椭圆轨道上运行，其轨道在空间几乎不相交。2、大部分小行星都位于远离地球3亿至4亿公里以外的空间。3、即使我们退一步说，如果个别行星轨道之间有相交点的话（这一可能性也是微乎其微的），那么这些行星也不具备在同一时刻经过交点的可能。因此这种可能也几乎是没有的。4、根据统计规律计算，大约每100万年小行星接近地球或碰撞地球的可能性只有2至3次，但这也不表明一定会与地球相碰。
    记者：历史上曾经发生过小行星撞击地球的事件吗？
    天文台：至少可以说，自有文明史以来没有发生过这种事件。而且，迄今为止还没有发现任何一颗小行星进入月—地轨道。
    记者：那么，落到地球上的陨石本来都是宇宙中的流星体了？
    天文台：对。太阳系里除了行星、小行星、卫星、彗星以外，还存在着大量的无以计数的小固体块和尘粒，总称为流星体。流星体小到微米量级，大到以米量度，它们都绕太阳公转。地球绕太阳公转时常会和流星体相遇。我们看到的流星就是流星体飞入地球大气后，在120公里至7.80公里高度之间，由于同大气分子碰撞生热而发出的亮光。如果流星体飞行方向和地面组成较大的角度，它就将落到地面上成为陨石。
    流星体数量巨大、无以计数，而小行星则不同。小行星直径一般为1公里至几十公里，直径大于100公里的小行星迄今只发现10颗，这些小行星同地球相撞的可能性几乎为零。
    记者：如果小行星同地球相撞，会产生哪些危害呢？利用现有科学技术，人类能设法避免它们相撞吗？
    天文台：我们有理由说明小行星与地球相撞的可能性几乎等于零。至于人类如何避免小行星与地球相撞以及危害的程度那是地球物理学家们关心的问题。
    记者：近期发现过距地球较近的小行星吗？具有哪些研究价值？
    天文台：1989年3月曾发现一颗距地球较近的小行星，命名为“1989FC”，3月23日该星在距地球75万公里处飞过，现在已远离我们2亿公里，不会对地球造成危害。对这种近地小行星的研究，是目前国际天文学的前沿课题，研究监视它们的动向和运动规律，特别是其物理性质。科学家认为，如果小行星是金属型的，那就意味着它是一个高品位的富矿，有的可达数十亿吨，是珍贵的宇宙资源。假如有一天人类真的想要驾驭小行星的话，面对如此富有的财富，一定又会叹息小行星离我们太远了。
    记者：国际天文学界在小行星的研究方面有哪些合作与信息交流？
    天文台：国际上有一个公认的小行星研究中心，这就是美国天体物理中心史密逊天文台，这是世界上小行星研究方面的资料汇总、轨道运算和信息发布的最权威机构。紫金山天文台行星室是我国研究小行星的权威机构，始终与史密逊天文台保持业务往来与信息的通报交流。（转载《科技日报》）
