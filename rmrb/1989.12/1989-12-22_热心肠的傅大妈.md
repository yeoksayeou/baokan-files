For the past 30 years, the hundreds of households of railway workers living in small courtyard houses on Heitu Lane in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, have all praised their neighborhood committee leader, Auntie Fu, for her dedication to helping others.

Auntie Fu, whose real name is Song Fudeng, is 65 years old. Since 1985, she has been the leader of the second neighborhood committee on Heitu Lane in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province. Although this position is not a high-ranking "official" and does not bring in any income, it involves a lot of responsibilities: collecting rent and electricity bills from each household, distributing study materials and registration forms, helping with weddings and funerals, and mediating neighborhood disputes and marital arguments. In short, any matters that the workplace and schools do not handle, she takes care of, and she does so with great enthusiasm.

Twenty-nine years ago, across the street from Auntie Fu's house, an elderly couple moved into a row house. The husband, Fan Lin, unfortunately had a brain disease, spoke incoherently, and was incontinent, often soiling his clothes. His wife was also plagued by numerous illnesses, and their home was in disarray. Some people, when visiting their home, would cover their noses and leave after a few words. However, Auntie Fu quickly became a frequent visitor to their home, helping with chores, cleaning the house, and taking home piles of soiled clothes to wash, dry, and fold neatly before returning them. From that time until 1982, when the two elderly people in their nineties moved away, she never stopped. Someone calculated that over the 20 years, she washed more clothes for these two elderly people than for any member of her own family.

As the saying goes, "It's hard for an impartial judge to settle family disputes." However, Auntie Fu is not afraid of trouble and mediates any disputes among neighbors. Once, a newlywed couple had an argument, and the husband, in a fit of anger, smashed a brand-new set of furniture with a hammer, leaving it full of holes. Auntie Fu rushed over, calming the couple down with words of advice. She then called her husband, who is skilled in carpentry, to repair each hole and paint the furniture. Auntie Fu not only busied herself but also made her husband a busy person as well. Someone half-jokingly, half-seriously said to her, "Auntie, you run around all day, talking and mediating, but you don't even earn a penny for shoe repairs. What do you gain from all this?" Auntie Fu patted her hands on her apron and laughed, "We live together like one family. Since I am healthy, running errands and doing things for everyone is a good thing."

Indeed, helping others seems to be Auntie Fu's nature. She changes light bulbs in public toilets, handles grain tickets and coupons for the 20 or so dual-income households every quarter; when neighbor Wang Xiuchun fell seriously ill and her husband was not at home, Auntie Fu called a few family members to make a stretcher and carried her to the railway hospital 5 kilometers away. In front of and behind Auntie Fu's house, there are a few workers who work night shifts. During the day, when they are resting at home, Auntie Fu makes several "do not disturb" signs and hangs them on the doors, reminding adults and children not to make noise near the windows.

Auntie Fu often takes care of outside matters during the day and does her own chores at night. Now, Auntie Fu has white hair and grandchildren, but she is still as energetic as she was in her youth, busy helping others.

    热心肠的傅大妈
    吕秀英　孙研真
    整整30个年头了，住在山西省太原市黑土巷小平房里的几百户铁路职工，都称赞他们的居民小组长傅大妈，说她为大伙办事最热心。
    傅大妈名宋富登，今年65岁。她从1985年起就担任了山西省太原市黑土巷二居委的居民小组长。别看这个小组长算不上什么“官”，又分文不挣，可它管的事真不少：房租、电费要一家家收，各种学习宣传材料、登记表格要一户户送；谁家婚丧嫁娶要去忙前忙后；哪里邻里不和夫妻吵架要去规劝调解。总之，凡是职工单位和孩子学校里管不着的事，她都要去管，而且管得很热心。
    29年前，和傅大妈家隔街相望的排房里，搬来了一对老年夫妻，丈夫范林不幸得了脑病，说话不清，大小便失禁，屎尿常常把裤子弄得脏脏的，老伴也是百病缠身，家里乱糟糟的。有的人到他家办事，说不上几句话就捂着鼻子出来了。可傅大妈很快就成了这家的常客，帮他们干杂活、收拾家务，把两位老人替换下来的一堆堆脏衣服抱回自己家里，洗净、晾干，然后叠得整整齐齐再送去。打那时起，直到1982年这两位年近9旬的老人搬走，从未间断过。有人细算了一下，20多年来，她给这两位老人洗的衣服比给自己家里任何一位亲人都洗得多。
    常言道，清官难断家务事。傅大妈却不怕麻烦，谁家有了磕磕碰碰的事她都去劝解。有一次，一对刚结婚不久的小夫妻吵起来了，小伙子一气之下，抡起榔头把崭新的组合家具砸得满是窟窿眼。傅大妈赶忙跑去，连说带劝，先给小两口消了气，又叫上会木工活的老伴一个窟窿一个窟窿把家具补好，刷上油漆。傅大妈不但自己忙乎，连老伴跟着她也成了大忙人。有人半开玩笑半正经地说：他大妈，你每天跑腿磨嘴，连鞋底钱都挣不上一分，你可图了个啥呀？傅大妈把两手在衣襟上拍拍，笑呵呵地说：“咱们住在一起就是一家人，我没病没灾的，为大伙跑跑腿、办点事有啥不好呢？”
    的确，为别人办事好像成了傅大妈的天性。公共厕所的灯泡坏一个换一个，每季度20几户双职工家里取粮票、领证券的事她也全包了下来；邻居王秀春得了重病，丈夫不在家，傅大妈叫来几名家属扎了个担架，一口气抬到5公里之外的铁路医院。在傅大妈家的前后屋里，有几个常年上夜班的职工，白天在家休息时，傅大妈就张罗着做了几个“休息牌”挂在门上，告诉大人小孩不要在窗前吵嚷。
    傅大妈常常是白天忙外面的事，晚上才干自家的活。如今，傅大妈满头白发，儿孙绕膝，可她还是像年青时那样劲头十足地为大伙忙乎着。
