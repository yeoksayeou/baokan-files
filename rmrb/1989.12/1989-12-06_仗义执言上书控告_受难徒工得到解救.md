The People's Daily published an article on October 31st on the fourth page titled "Illegally Recruiting Child Laborers, Exploiting and Beating Apprentices: Individual Business Owner Zhou Jian is Arrested," which sparked a strong response among the public. Many people asked, who wrote to the leaders of the State Council to report Zhou Jian? It was learned that the writer is Yang Qǐkē, a village teacher from Dongfang Jing Village, Lidu Town, Nanchong County, the hometown of the suffering apprentices. The process of Yang Qǐkē speaking out justly and reporting to higher authorities is as follows:

In mid-February of this year, individual business owner Zhou Jian, who was operating the Self-Reliance Leather Factory in Yongfeng Township, Jinniu District, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, illegally recruited a batch of apprentices from Lidu Town, Nanchong County, including 11 child laborers. After working for more than a month, He Yìbīng and others from Dongfang Jing Village successively wrote letters home, describing how they were deceived: Zhou Jian's Self-Reliance Leather Factory had poor conditions, with damp, leaky, and crowded housing, about one square meter per person; the food was also very poor, with each person getting a small bowl of porridge in the morning, a small steamed bun with porridge at noon, and never enough to eat, with very low wages, not even enough to buy toothpaste or get a haircut. If the workers had any dissatisfaction, they would be lightly punished by being made to kneel or have their food withheld, and severely beaten by Zhou Jian and his hired thugs.

This unfortunate news made the parents of the apprentices restless, and seven parents wrote letters to inquire, all of which were intercepted by the factory. In mid-June, villagers Li Tòngquán and others went to Chengdu to retrieve their children, but were blocked by a guard dog at the factory gate. Li Tòngquán gave the dog handler 70 yuan, and on the night of June 17, he quietly took out the eight apprentices from Dongfang Jing Village who had been deceived.

After listening to the complaints of the escaped apprentices, Yang Qǐkē, a village teacher from Dongfang Jing Village, Lidu Town, was particularly outraged to hear that a young girl's hair had been cut, her clothes torn, and her money taken away, and she was beaten until she vomited blood. He was so angry that he couldn't sleep all night. Therefore, he sat down and wrote two letters to Zhou Jian, the factory director of Self-Reliance Leather Factory, and Jiang Xiānzé, the deputy director, condemning their illegal acts of beating child laborers and cruelly exploiting workers, demanding that they immediately stop and return the 300 yuan deposit and 105 yuan living expenses that the apprentices had paid in advance.

After a few days, Yang Qǐkē received a reply from Zhou Jian: "You don't spread rumors. The people who ran away want their deposit and living expenses, which is a pipe dream. I have friends in the public security and judicial departments, wide connections, and strong backing. You can report to the central government, and I am not afraid." "If you dare to report, just wait and see, you will not have a good ending!"

Yang Qǐkē became even more angry. He thought, with the Communist Party and the people's government, why should we be afraid of Zhou Jian's tyranny? Therefore, he decided to expose Zhou Jian's crimes of deceiving and recruiting child laborers and exploiting and beating workers. He found people who had escaped from the Self-Reliance Leather Factory to understand the situation in detail, repeatedly verifying each detail, and wrote a letter exposing Zhou Jian's crimes, which was sent to the leaders of the State Council on July 22nd.

In early August, Premier Li Peng, upon receiving Yang Qǐkē's letter of accusation, immediately instructed Sichuan Province to handle the matter. In early September, the leaders of Sichuan Province designated relevant departments to form an investigation team, who went from Chengdu to Lidu Town, Nanchong County, to investigate the matter.

On October 21st, Zhou Jian, who deceived and recruited child laborers and arbitrarily exploited and beat workers, was arrested by law. On November 15th, Zhou Jian was sentenced to two years and six months in prison.

Everyone praised Yang Qǐkē's selfless and fearless courage in upholding justice.

    仗义执言上书控告  受难徒工得到解救
    人民日报10月31日第四版刊登了《非法招收童工　盘剥毒打学徒
　个体业主周坚被逮捕》的消息后，在群众中引起强烈反响。人们纷纷打问，是谁向国务院领导同志写信，控告了周坚？经了解，写信人叫杨启科，他是受难徒工家乡——南充县李渡镇东方井村民办教师。他仗义执言上书控告的经过是：
    今年2月中旬，个体业主周坚非法经营的四川成都市金牛区永丰乡自力皮革厂，以欺骗的手段从南充县李渡镇招收了一批徒工，其中有11名童工。这些学徒上班一个多月后，东方井村何义兵等人先后给家里写信，叙说他们上当受骗的情形：周坚办的这个自力皮革厂条件恶劣，住房潮湿、破漏、拥挤，人均约一平方米；吃的也很差，早上每人一两稀饭，中午一个小馒头加稀饭，顿顿吃不饱，工资非常低，连买牙膏、理发的钱都没有。工人稍有不满，轻者罚跪、扣饭，重者便遭受周坚和他雇的打手毒打。
    这不幸的消息使徒工的父母坐卧不安，有7名家长写信询问，均因厂里检查被扣留下来。6月中旬，村民李通全等人专程去成都领孩子，被周坚喂的一条守门狗挡在门外。李通全给看狗人70元钱，才在6月17日深夜从厂里悄悄接出东方井村被骗的8名徒工。
    李渡镇东方井村的民办教师杨启科听了逃出的徒工的控诉后，特别听到一少女的头发被周坚剪了，衣服被撕烂了，家中带去的钱也被搜走了，还被打得口吐鲜血的遭遇后，气愤得通宵睡不着觉。于是，他伏案疾书，接连给自力皮革厂厂长周坚、副厂长蒋先泽去了两封信，谴责他们毒打童工、残酷压榨工人的违法行为，要他们立即悬崖勒马，并如数退回徒工进厂时预交的300元抵押金和105元生活费。
    过了几天，杨老师收到周坚的回信：“你不要造谣，逃跑人想要押金、生活费是白日作梦；我在公安司法部门有朋友，关系广，靠山硬，你告到中央我也不怕”，“如果你敢告，走着瞧，你绝没有好下场！”
    杨老师更加愤怒了。他想，有共产党、人民政府，还怕你周坚横行？于是决定揭露周坚骗招童工、盘剥毒打工人的罪行。他找从自力皮革厂跑回来的人详细了解情况，反复核实每个情节，写了一封揭露周坚罪行的控告信，于7月22日寄给了国务院领导同志。
    8月上旬，国务院总理李鹏在收到杨启科控告信的当天，即批示四川省查处。9月初，四川省领导同志指定由有关部门组成调查组，专程从成都赴南充县李渡镇调查。
    10月21日，骗招童工、肆意盘剥毒打工人的周坚被依法逮捕。11月15日，周坚被判处有期徒刑2年零6个月。
    人们都在赞扬杨老师无私无畏，敢于伸张正义的高尚品德。
