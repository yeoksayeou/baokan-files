It has been 23 years since the former Deputy Director (in reality, the acting Deputy Director) of the Central Organization Department, Comrade Zhao Han, passed away. He was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution.

As surviving comrades and subordinates, we express our deep remembrance of him through this article.

Comrade Zhao Han, originally named Wang Zhaohan, was from Ding County, Hebei. When he entered high school, it was right after the July 7th Incident. A 19-year-old youth filled with patriotic fervor and a strong sense of justice, under the influence of the Party's education, began his anti-Japanese activities. In early 1938, he joined the guerrilla forces and became a member of the Communist Party. He served as the secretary of the district committee, the head of the organizational department of the county committee, the head of the organizational department of the regional committee, the secretary of the regional committee, the secretary of the Datong municipal committee, the director of the office, the secretary, and the deputy director of the Central Organization Department, among other positions.

In September 1943, Zhao Han was selected as a representative of the Party's Seventh Congress due to his ability to grasp principles, consider the overall situation, work independently, and his decisive and efficient style. He studied at the Central Party School in Yan'an and participated in the Seventh Congress. In October 1945, with the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, Comrade An Zifeng, considering the overall situation, recommended Zhao Han back to the Central Bureau of Jin-Cha-Ji and wrote a letter to Comrade Zhao Zhensheng (Li Bo Hua), recommending him for the position of secretary of the regional committee.

In 1951, the Party Central Committee urgently needed to strengthen its institutions and replenish its cadres, and Zhao Han was transferred back to the Central Organization Department. He worked there for 17 years.

I

Comrade Zhao Han always emphasized investigation and research, and insisted on seeking truth from facts.

The Central Organization Department is the Party's organizational work office and the Party's assistant and think tank in organizational work. As the secretary of the Central Organization Department, Comrade Zhao Han, entrusted by the department leadership, was responsible for refining and unifying the department's documents, whether they were about organizational work, cadre work, or internal construction. As a deputy director, the office and research room he was in charge of were business units that assisted the director in overall management and macro research. Comrade Zhao Han himself was a well-known writer in the Central Organization Department. Under his unified arrangement and specific organization, many documents issued and received by the Central Organization Department were specifically revised and finalized by him.

In 1953, Comrade Zhao Han (then director of the office) and Comrade Wang Fu (then director of the Party member management office) went to Shandong and discovered serious bureaucratism and commandism in the party and government organizations. They felt that the personnel in the leading organs at the level of prefectures and above did not understand or care about the sufferings of the people, and did not understand or care about the situation of the grassroots organizations, which caused serious problems. As a result, some county, district, and township-level cadres had not changed their old ways and exhibited lawlessness. However, their investigation work was obstructed by the local party organization, and even the main responsible person of the Shandong Bureau of the Central Committee at that time did not support them. To protect the interests of the Party and the people, they reported to Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai through Comrade An Zifeng. In the first half of 1959, after the departmental meeting of the Central Organization Department made a decision, Comrade Zhao Han specifically organized six work teams, drafted the investigation outline, and led department-level cadres to go to Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guizhou, and Gansu provinces to visit some communes and understand the situation of the Party's organizational leadership. After the work teams returned to Beijing, he organized the on-site investigation personnel to report at the departmental meeting and, according to Comrade An Zifeng's opinion, organized personnel to compile many county committees and commune party committees' leadership methods and the bad habits of cadres that had deviated from the masses and their manifestations into brief reports. They reported to the Central Committee in a truthful manner. Looking back now, the "leftist" things reflected in the brief reports at that time were still quite real.

In July 1962, under the leadership of Comrade Zhao Han, the "July Comprehensive Report of the Central Organization Department" was drafted, reporting to Chairman Mao and the Standing Committee of the Politburo the situation and problems in the cadre team. The report listed examples of some high-level cadres seeking special treatment, exaggerating minor illnesses, and traveling everywhere, and proposed that various bad phenomena such as cadres seeking special treatment and waning revolutionary will should be educated from a positive perspective to help them correct their mistakes. For those who had made serious mistakes and refused to change, disciplinary action should be taken, but "do not abuse organizational measures, and do not repeat the mistakes of chaotic struggles and chaotic criticism." In August 1962, after Comrade Mao Zedong wrongly criticized the Central Organization Department as having become an "independent kingdom," they reported to the Chairman and the Politburo on the "Report on the Situation of Implementing Democratic Centralism in Various Places," reflecting on issues related to party democracy, party struggle, party committee system, and maintaining centralization and unity. The report also pointed out that some cadres had a demand for great democracy. After analyzing the ideological trends within the party, they proposed to the Central Committee to strengthen the democratic centralism of the party: continue to organize party members and cadres to study the relevant instructions of the Central Committee in depth; hold party representative conferences, party committee meetings, standing committee meetings, and organizational life meetings of leading cadres on time; to strengthen the leadership of the party, the party committee must get rid of administrative affairs and take a series of measures to give play to the role of the government and various departments; strengthen the inspection of the implementation of democratic centralism. In March 1963, Comrade Zhao Han also published an article in the People's Daily titled "Doing a Good Job in the Regular Work of the Party's Grassroots Organizations," pointing out that "all the work of our party must be rooted in the party's grassroots organizations. The party's grassroots organizations are the link between the party and the masses and the party's fortress in the masses." He required the party's grassroots organizations to regularly organize party members to conduct organizational life, regularly guide party members to work with non-party masses, lead the work of non-party organizations, and help them improve their regular work. To improve the quality of party members and cadres and enhance the party's fighting capacity, the party member textbook personally reviewed and issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in 1962 was also co-edited by Comrade Zhao Han on behalf of the Central Organization Department and Comrade Xu Ligeng of the Central Propaganda Department. This textbook was the basic teaching material for party member education at that time.

The writing team led by Comrade Zhao Han drafted the "Several Experiences and Lessons in Party Organizational Work" (also known as the "Summary of 13 Years of Organizational Work") in 1962, which included the viewpoints on "opposing the tendency to carry out party building in isolation from the party's political tasks and opposing the tendency to focus only on economic affairs while neglecting party building"; the viewpoints on "the party should achieve strong leadership, but it should not manage everything," "it should not set aside the organizational power seized through long-term revolutionary struggles," and "it should not neglect the work of building the party itself"; the viewpoints on "the party constitution should be implemented in all party life"; and the viewpoints on "the central issue in cadre work is to improve the quality of cadres," etc., which still provide inspiration today.

In 1958, Comrade Zhao Han led 49 cadres of the Central Organization Department to go to Wufu County, Anhui for grassroots work and labor training. Due to the truthful reporting of the problems of falsifying grain production and serious commandism by local leading cadres, he was criticized by the main leaders of the provincial committee. After the "anti-rightist struggle" began, the leaders of the provincial committee forced the relevant leaders of the Central Organization Department to make a self-criticism. Comrade Zhao Han insisted on seeking truth from facts in any situation, took the initiative to bear the pressure, and protected the comrades below him. With the support of Comrade An Zifeng, he never made a self-criticism against his conscience. In 1959, during the nationwide "anti-rightist struggle," a comrade who was transferred to the theoretical class of the Central Party School was criticized for speaking some truths about the national situation. Comrade Zhao Han believed that this comrade had made no mistakes and resolutely transferred him back to the Central Organization Department to continue his work. In August 1966, on the eve of the "uncovering of the lid" in the Central Organization Department, a comrade who was transferred to Beijing to participate in the "Four Clean-ups" movement secretly returned to the Central Organization Department and reported to Comrade Zhao Han about the misunderstanding of the good people who were being persecited in the early days of the Cultural Revolution. Although he had a premonition of impending disaster, he comforted her, saying that the truth would be clarified, good people are good people! He told her to persist and not to be afraid. Because his own days were not good, he also warned her not to come to the Central Organization Department again to avoid being implicated.

II

Comrade Zhao Han was full of vitality and energy. During the period of peaceful construction after the founding of the nation, he had many innovations in his work. The most outstanding example was his proposal to cultivate and select new forces. In the first half of 1963, Comrade Zhao Han went to Fujian for an investigation and discovered that a prominent problem in the cadre team was that the leading cadres at the prefecture and county levels were either relatively old or the proportion of local cadres was very small. This reflected the lack of cultivation of cadres who had grown up after the founding of the nation, which was essentially a problem of cultivating new forces. Therefore, it was necessary to consciously strengthen the training, cultivation, and promotion of new forces; and it was believed that this was a universal problem that had to be proposed and solved. Comrade An Zifeng fully agreed with this opinion. When the report was submitted to the Central Secretariat, Comrade Deng Xiaoping attached great importance to it and made instructions. Afterwards, the Central Organization Department further organized cadres to investigate the situation of the leading core at all levels above the prefecture level and, under the leadership of Comrade Zhao Han, wrote a report to the Central Committee on adjusting the leading core and cultivating and promoting new forces. At that time, the leading core at all levels above the county level generally lacked new blood. The leading cadres of the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees and the central departments were mostly in their fifties or even sixties; the leading cadres at the department, bureau, and division levels of the provinces, municipalities, and central departments were generally around 47 years old; the county committee secretaries were generally in their forties. This age structure of cadres at different levels, due to the "Cultural Revolution" delaying the growth of several generations, has not yet been completely realized even after more than 20 years today. But at that time, Comrade Zhao Han was able to recognize that "new and old replacement is a natural law, and if new ones are not cultivated in advance, there will be a danger of having no successors in the future." This is indeed rare and precious. In May 1964, Comrade Zhao Han published an article in the People's Daily titled "Actively Cultivating and Boldly Promoting New Forces," proposing that cultivating new forces is a strategic task of the party, breaking through the ideological obstacles to cultivating and promoting new forces, cultivating and promoting new forces is the sacred duty of old cadres, making new forces continuously revolutionary, etc. He required new forces to gradually understand and master the objective laws of the development of socialist society, learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and us, learn to lead production, manage the economy and cultural undertakings, learn to master modern science and technology, etc. Comrade Zhao Han also practiced what he preached. In 1965, after the department leadership studied and approved, he promoted a cadre in his thirties and at the administrative level 16 to be the deputy director of the office. This was a very enlightened measure at that time, a major breakthrough in the personnel system in the party committee organization department that paid more attention to seniority, and set an example in the organizational departments across the country.

III

Comrade Zhao Han's democratic style was renowned in the Central Organization Department before the Cultural Revolution. His democratic style, on the one hand, was reflected in his work. He always discussed matters with everyone, listened to different opinions, treated people equally, and united with comrades. At meetings, he generally let everyone speak first and encouraged everyone to speak freely and thoroughly, and only then put forward his own opinions. Because he humbly absorbed the reasonable factors from all sides, his conclusions were substantial, targeted, and convincing. When he organized everyone to draft documents and write important articles, he first reasonably divided the work according to the business knowledge and proficiency of different people, determined the main writer, and then let the writing cadres collect materials, draft the writing outline, including the main viewpoints and necessary typical materials, and handed them over to the writing team for full discussion. Generally, the research room personnel and the relevant business unit cadres participated. Then, he clarified the quality, time, and even the number of words required, and the main writer concentrated his efforts and time to ensure the submission of the draft. After repeated in-depth discussions, Comrade Zhao Han personally presided over the revision, and finally revised it word by word, sentence by sentence, and punctuation mark by punctuation mark and submitted it to the department leadership. At that time, the research room of the Central Organization Department was the most active unit in the entire department in terms of thought, with a strong academic atmosphere. Many major theoretical and practical issues could be freely discussed, and everyone could express their opinions. A few comrades with insight and a spirit of exploration often argued fiercely, and Comrade Zhao Han often silently listened to everyone's eager speeches, never interrupting anyone's train of thought, and never imposing his views on others. He only occasionally made a few remarks on key issues, inspiring everyone to delve deeper into their research. Comrades all felt that they benefited greatly. He also dared to reflect on and summarize historical experience as things developed. That "Summary of 13 Years of Organizational Work" was written through fully advocating democracy, listening to opinions from all sides, and refining and processing in the midst of differing opinions. Comrade Zhao Han was hardworking, thrifty, honest, and public-spirited, closely connected with the masses, and paid attention to setting an example. He supported his parents for a long time, but even comrades who had worked with him for many years did not know how much his family had sacrificed for his participation in the revolution and how much his relatives had contributed to the party. He lived simply, did not pursue material enjoyment, and had a rich and fulfilling spiritual life. Whenever he rested, he often picked up his paddle and played a few games of table tennis with everyone. Under his influence, everyone in the research room had a table tennis racket. During the period when he led cadres to go to Wufu County, Anhui for work, he was very dissatisfied with the arrogance, lack of policy, false reporting of production, and disregard for the sufferings of the people by the local leading cadres, and often expressed that the Kuomintang style was incompatible with the style of communists. He also fought unremittingly in his actual work. Later, that cadre was finally removed from his position. Comrade Zhao Han upheld his principles and protected the interests of the people, restoring the party's influence in the local area. Under the leadership of the department, including Comrade Zhao Han, the democratic atmosphere in the Central Organization Department was relatively strong, the principles of the cadres were relatively strong, and the grasp of policies was relatively stable. Although there were mistakes in the anti-rightist and "anti-rightist" movements, and some good people were injured, they were quickly corrected. Many cadres who were transferred out of the Central Organization Department missed that lively and lively political life.

    坚持原则  实事求是
    ——怀念原中组部副部长赵汉
    王雨亭　陆沅
    原中组部副部长（实际上是常务副部长）赵汉同志不幸逝世已经23个年头了。他是在“文革”中被迫害致死的。
    作为幸存者的战友和部下，我们谨以这篇文章表达对他的深切怀念。
    赵汉同志原名王兆汉，是河北定县人。当他考入高中时，正值七·七事变之后。一个满腔热血、富于爱国心和正义感的19岁青年，在党的教育影响下，开始了抗日活动。1938年初他参加了游击队，并加入了共产党。他历任区委书记，县委组织部长，地委组织部长，地委书记，大同市委书记，中央组织部办公厅主任、秘书长、副部长等职务。
    1943年9月，赵汉以他能掌握原则，顾全全局，有独立工作能力和雷厉风行的作风等长处，被选为党的七大代表，在延安中央党校学习并参加了七大。1945年10月，革命形势迅猛发展，安子文同志从全局出发，把赵汉同志介绍回晋察冀中央局，并给赵振声（即李葆华）同志写了信，推荐他担任地委正副书记一类职务。
    1951年，党中央各部亟需健全机构、充实干部，赵汉同志调回中央组织部。他在中组部先后工作了17年。
    一
    赵汉同志一贯注重调查研究，坚持实事求是。
    中央组织部是中央在党的组织工作方面的办事机关，是中央在组织工作方面的助手和参谋部。作为中央组织部的秘书长，赵汉同志受部领导的委托，对中央组织部出手的文件，无论是组织工作方面的、干部工作方面的、内部建设方面的，他都负有取精用宏、统一把关的职责；作为副部长，他分工管理的办公厅和研究室则是协助部长进行全面管理和宏观研究的业务单位；赵汉同志本身又是中央组织部有名的笔杆子。在他的统一安排和具体组织下，中央组织部许多上报下达的文件都由他具体修改定稿。
    1953年，赵汉同志（当时任办公室主任）会同王甫同志（当时任党员管理处处长）到山东了解到党政组织中存在着严重的官僚主义现象和命令主义作风，深感专区以上领导机关工作人员中存在不了解和不关心人民群众疾苦，不了解不关心基层组织情况造成的严重问题，使得一些县、区、乡三级干部还没有改变旧作风，存在着违法乱纪现象。但他们的调查工作却受到当地党组织的阻挠，甚至连当时中共中央山东分局的主要负责人也不支持他们。为了维护党和人民的利益，他们经由安子文同志向刘少奇和周恩来同志作了反映。1959年上半年，在中央组织部部务会议作出决定后，赵汉同志具体组织了6个工作组，审定了调查提纲，由部级领导干部带队分别到河北、山西、浙江、湖南、贵州、甘肃等省，深入到一些公社，了解党的组织领导的情况。各地工作组返京后，他又组织实地调查人员在部务会议上作了汇报，并按照安子文同志的意见，组织人力把不少县委和公社党委的领导方法和干部中存在的脱离群众的不良作风及其表现综合整理成简报，实事求是地向中央作了报告。现在看来，在当时那种形势下，简报中反映的那些“左”的东西还是相当真实的。
    1962年7月，在赵汉同志主持下，起草了《中央组织部7月份综合报告》，向毛主席、政治局常委反映了干部队伍中的一些情况和问题。报告列举了一些高级干部闹特殊化、小病大养、到处游山玩水等例子后，提出对于干部闹特殊化、革命意志衰退等各种不良现象，要从正面进行教育，帮助他们改正。对于错误严重、屡教不改的，还应当绳之以纪律，但是“不要滥用组织手段，不要重复乱斗争、乱批判的错误”。1962年8月，在毛泽东同志错误地批评中央组织部“成了一个独立王国”之后，他们又向主席、政治局作了《关于各地执行民主集中制情况的报告》，对党内民主、党内斗争、党委制和维护中央集中统一等方面的问题做了反映，批评了前几年各地较普遍存在的压制民主、个人专断和分散主义的错误倾向。报告也指出有一些干部，有一种要求大民主的情绪。在分析了党内的思想动向之后，向中央提出加强党的民主集中制的建议：继续组织党员干部深入学习中央有关指示；按期召开党的代表大会、党委会、常委会以及领导干部的组织生活会；为了切实加强党的领导，必须使党委摆脱行政事务，采取一系列措施发挥政府和各部门的作用；加强对民主集中制贯彻执行情况的检查。1963年3月，赵汉同志又在《人民日报》上发表《做好党的基层组织的经常工作》一文，指出“我们党的一切工作，都要扎根于党的基层组织。党的基层组织，是党联系群众的纽带，是党在群众中的战斗堡垒”。他要求党的基层组织要经常组织党员过组织生活，要经常指导党员向非党群众做工作，要领导好非党组织的工作，帮助他们把各自的经常工作健全起来。为了提高党员、干部的素质，提高党的战斗力，1962年由邓小平同志亲自审阅印发的党员课本，也是由赵汉同志代表中央组织部与中共中央宣传部许立群等同志合作编写的。这个课本当时是在全国进行党员教育的基本教材。
    以赵汉同志为首的写作班子，在1962年研究起草了《关于党的组织工作的若干经验教训》（又名《13年组织工作基本总结》），其中关于“既要反对离开党的政治任务，孤立地进行党的建设，又要反对只重视经济事务，而忽视党的建设的倾向”的观点；关于“党应该实现坚强的领导，但是不能包办一切”，“决不应该把经过长期革命斗争夺取到的政权组织撇在一边。决不应该对我们党的自身建设工作置之不顾”的观点；“必须把党章贯彻到党的全部生活中去”的观点；关于“干部工作中的中心问题，是提高干部的质量”的观点等等，至今仍给人以启示。
    1958年，赵汉同志带领中央组织部49名干部下放安徽无为县进行基层工作和劳动锻炼，由于如实反映了当地领导干部在上报粮食产量时弄虚作假和强迫命令作风严重等问题，受到省委主要领导人的指责。“反右倾斗争”开始后，省委领导人强迫中组部有关领导做检查，赵汉同志硬着头皮顶住，始终强调任何情况下都要实事求是，并主动承担压力，保护下面的同志，在安子文同志的支持下，始终未作违心的检查。1959年全国开展“反右倾斗争”时，中央组织部一位调到中央党校理论班学习的同志，因对全国的形势讲了一些真话，受到了错误的批判。赵汉同志认为这位同志并没有什么错误，毅然决然把他调回中央组织部继续工作。1966年8月，中央组织部“揭盖子”前夕，一位被抽调到北京市参加“四清”运动的同志暗中回中央组织部，向赵汉同志反映对“文化大革命”初期挨整的净是好人不理解时，他虽已预感到大祸行将临头，却安慰她说，事情总归会弄清楚，好人就是好人！要她坚持下去，不要怕。由于他自己的日子很不好过，又打招呼说，以后不要再来中央组织部了，以免受牵连。
    二
    赵汉同志生气勃勃，充满活力。在建国后的和平建设时期，他在工作中有许多创新，最突出的事例，就是他首先提出了培养选拔新生力量的问题和建议。1963年上半年，赵汉同志到福建进行调查，发现干部队伍方面一个突出的问题，就是在地、县的领导干部中，一是年龄较大，一是本地干部所占比例很小，这反映了对建国后生长起来的干部培养不够，实质上是个培养新生力量的问题。因此，需要有意识的加强锻炼、培养和提拔新生力量的工作；并且认为这是一个带普遍性的问题，已经到了提出和解决问题的时候了。安子文同志非常赞成这个意见。报告上送到中央书记处时，邓小平同志高度重视，作了批示。此后，中央组织部又进一步组织干部对地委以上各级领导核心的情况作了调查，并由赵汉同志主持，向中央写了关于调整领导核心和培养提拔新生力量的报告。当时县以上各级领导核心，普遍缺乏新的血液。省、市、自治区党委和中央各部的领导干部，多数是五十几岁，甚至六十几岁；省的部、厅、局，地、市委和中央各部的司局一级领导干部，一般是47岁左右；县委书记一般是40来岁。这种不同层次干部年龄结构，由于“文化大革命”耽误了几代人的成长，直到20多年以后的今天，也还没有完全实现。但那时赵汉同志即能认识到“新陈代谢是自然规律，如果不及早培养新的，将来就有后继无人的危险。”这确实是难能可贵的。1964年5月，赵汉同志在《人民日报》发表了《积极地培养和大胆地提拔新生力量》的文章，提出培养新生力量是党的一项战略任务，要打破培养提拔新生力量的思想障碍，培养提拔新生力量是老干部的神圣职责，要使新生力量不断革命化等一系列重要观点。他要求新生力量逐步认识和掌握社会主义社会发展的客观规律，学会正确处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾，学会领导生产、管理经济和科学文化事业，学会掌握现代科学文化事业，学会掌握现代科学技术等各项本领。赵汉同志还身体力行，1965年，经过部领导研究批准，在他分工领导的办公厅提拔了一名30多岁、行政16级的干部担任了办公厅副主任。这在当时是很开明的措施，在比较注重资历的党委组织部门，这是一次用人制度方面的重要突破，在全国组织部门中做出了榜样。
    三
    赵汉同志的民主作风，在“文化大革命”前的中央组织部是有口皆碑的。他的民主作风，一方面表现在工作上，遇事总是同大家商量，倾听不同意见，平等待人，团结同志。开会时一般让大家先讲话，动员大家要知无不言，言无不尽，最后才拿出自己的意见。由于他虚心吸取了各方面的合理因素，因此结论言之有物，有针对性，令人信服。在他组织大家起草文件、撰写重要文章时，首先是根据不同人员的业务知识和熟练程度合理分工，确定主要执笔人，然后放手让执笔的干部去收集材料，拟出写作提纲，包括主要观点和必要的典型材料，交付参加写作的班子充分讨论，一般是研究室人员会同有关业务单位的干部参加。然后明确质量、时间直至字数的要求，由主要执笔人集中力量和时间保证拿出初稿。稿子经过反复深入讨论后，再由赵汉同志亲自主持修改，最后由他自己动手逐字逐句逐个标点修订上报部领导。那时，中央组织部研究室是整个部思想最活跃的单位，学术空气浓厚，许多重大理论及现实问题都可以畅所欲言，各抒己见，有几个比较有见地、勇于探索的同志，经常争论得不可开交，赵汉同志往往默默地听着大家争先恐后的发言，从不打断大家的思路，更不强加于人，只是偶尔在关键问题上点一两句，启发大家深入钻研，同志们都感到受益匪浅。他还勇于随着事物的发展，不断进行反思，总结历史经验。那本《13年组织工作基本总结》就是在充分发扬民主、全面听取意见，在不同意见的争论中提炼加工写成的。赵汉同志艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公，密切联系群众，注意以身作则。他长期奉养父母，但即使同他共事多年的同志也不知道为了他参加革命，家庭付出了多大牺牲，他的亲属对党有多大贡献。他生活简单，不追求物质享受，精神生活内容丰富充实，每到休息时，往往挥拍上阵，同大家打几场乒乓球。在他的影响下，研究室每人都备有一副乒乓球拍。在他带领干部下放安徽无为县工作期间，对当地主要领导干部的专横跋扈、不讲政策、虚报产量、放假卫星，不关心群众疾苦，不顾群众死活的做法极为不满，多次表示这种国民党作风同共产党人的作风水火不相容，并在实际工作中进行了不懈的斗争。后来那个干部终于被撤职，赵汉同志以自己的原则性维护了人民利益，挽回了党在当地的影响。在部领导，包括赵汉同志的影响下，中央组织部的民主空气比较浓厚，干部原则性比较强，掌握政策比较稳当。尽管在反右派、“反右倾运动”中也有失误，伤了个别好人，但很快就得到纠正。许多调出中央组织部的干部，对那一段生动活泼的政治生活，都很留恋。
    23年之后，在党经过又一次严峻考验胜利的日子里，追忆赵汉同志在加强党的建设方面的奉献，确实具有特殊的意义。
