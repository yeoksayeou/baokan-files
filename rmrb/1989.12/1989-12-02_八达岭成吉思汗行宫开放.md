The Genghis Khan Palace at Badaling Opens to the Public

BEIJING, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) — The Genghis Khan Palace, located at the foot of the Great Wall in Badaling, Beijing, opened to the public today.

According to historical records, in 1213 and 1215, Genghis Khan led his troops to attack Beijing and camped here twice. The newly constructed Genghis Khan Palace, built on the original site, covers an area of 1,000 square meters and features strong Mongolian architectural characteristics. The main structure of the palace is a 13-meter-high golden-topped grand tent, inside which a replica of Genghis Khan's throne is placed. Above the throne hangs a portrait of Genghis Khan. On either side of the grand tent are smaller tents.
