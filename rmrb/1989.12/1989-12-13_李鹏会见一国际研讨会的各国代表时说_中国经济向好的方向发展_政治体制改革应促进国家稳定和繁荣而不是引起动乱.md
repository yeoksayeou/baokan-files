Li Peng Meets with Representatives of an International Symposium, Says China's Economy is Developing in a Positive Direction, Political System Reform Should Promote National Stability and Prosperity, Not Cause Turmoil

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th – (Reporter Yang Guojun) Premier Li Peng met with representatives from various countries attending the "Persisting in Reform and Opening Up, Expanding Foreign Economic Cooperation" international symposium this afternoon at the Zhongnanhai's Ziguang Pavilion.

The host and guests engaged in a friendly conversation that lasted over two hours.

At the request of foreign guests, Li Peng first introduced the domestic situation and the policy of reform and opening up. When introducing the domestic situation, Li Peng said, "After more than a year of effort, the work of rectification and adjustment has made significant progress, and the overall economy is developing in a positive direction. Of course, there are still some temporary difficulties in the economy, which are both long-standing issues and newly emerging contradictions. However, we have many favorable conditions to overcome these difficulties."

Li Peng said that the guiding ideology of current economic work is to actively push forward rectification and adjustment and deepen reforms while maintaining social stability. He said, "We are full of confidence in this regard."

Li Peng emphasized the need to maintain the continuity and stability of the reform and opening-up policy, that is, the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, the contract system and the manager responsibility system in enterprises, the fiscal contract system between the central and local governments, the policy on individual and private economies, as well as the policies on special economic zones, coastal opening, and preferential treatment for attracting foreign investment. Of course, these policies need to be supplemented and improved in practice.

Li Peng emphasized that China's development of the national economy is through the combination of planned economy and market regulation. In this process, we must not use the proportion of market economy to measure whether the reform is progressing or regressing. He said, "The view that a smaller proportion of market economy means reform regression is incorrect."

When discussing political system reform, Li Peng said that the view that China only focuses on economic system reform and not on political system reform is incorrect. Political system reform and economic system reform are proceeding simultaneously. Like economic system reform, political system reform must also start from China's actual situation, aiming to mobilize the enthusiasm of the people to the greatest extent, so that everyone is full of confidence and works wholeheartedly to achieve the four modernizations. Li Peng pointed out that political system reform should promote national stability and prosperity, rather than cause social turmoil.

When discussing opening up to the outside world, Li Peng said that China will adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit to carry out economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries. He welcomed people from all walks of life in foreign countries to visit China to increase their understanding of China. "Seeing is believing." To understand the actual situation, it is best to come to China and see for yourself.

Li Peng also answered some questions raised by the guests regarding the current international situation. In his speech, Li Peng positively evaluated the ongoing international symposium and thanked the participants from various countries for their constructive suggestions on China's economic work.

The foreign guests present expressed their satisfaction with seeing that China's reform and opening-up policy remains unchanged and said they are willing to further explore ways and channels for cooperation with a positive attitude. An economist present said that China's rectification and adjustment policy is successful, and he hopes these policies will continue to be implemented. During the meeting, Ma Hong, Director-General of the Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center of the State Council, was present.

The "Persisting in Reform and Opening Up, Expanding Foreign Economic Cooperation" international symposium opened yesterday. Notable figures from the financial and business sectors of countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, the United States, Japan, and the Hong Kong region attended the conference.

    李鹏会见一国际研讨会的各国代表时说
    中国经济向好的方向发展
    政治体制改革应促进国家稳定和繁荣而不是引起动乱
    新华社北京12月12日电　（记者杨国钧）国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了出席正在这里举行的“坚持改革开放、扩大对外经济合作”国际研讨会的各国代表。
    宾主进行了长达两个多小时的友好交谈。
    应外国客人的要求，李鹏首先介绍了中国国内的情况和改革开放政策。在介绍国内情况时，李鹏说，“经过一年多的努力，治理整顿工作已取得明显进展，整个经济正向好的方向发展。当然，目前在经济上也面临一些暂时困难，这既有多年积累的问题，也有新出现的矛盾。但是，我们具备许多克服困难的有利条件。”
    李鹏说，当前经济工作的总指导思想是，在保持社会稳定的前提下，积极推进治理整顿和深化改革。他说，“对此，我们充满信心。”
    李鹏强调要保持改革开放政策的连续性和稳定性，即农村家庭联产承包责任制、企业的承包制和厂长负责制、中央和地方财政包干政策、个体和私营经济政策以及经济特区、沿海开放和优惠吸引外资的政策都不变，当然，要在实践中对这些政策不断补充和完善。
    李鹏强调，中国发展国民经济是通过计划经济与市场调节相结合。在这一过程中，决不能用市场经济所占比重多少去衡量改革是前进或是倒退。他说，“认为市场经济成分少一点就是改革倒退的观点是不正确的。”
    在谈到政治体制改革时，李鹏说，那种认为中国只搞经济体制改革不搞政治体制改革的看法是不正确的。政治体制与经济体制改革是同步进行的。同经济体制改革一样，政治体制改革也要从中国的实际情况出发，其目的是最大限度地调动人民群众的积极性，使大家充满信心，一心一意地为实现四化而奋斗。李鹏指出，政治体制改革应促进国家的稳定和繁荣，而不是引起社会动乱。
    在谈到对外开放时，李鹏说，中国将坚持在平等互利的基础上，同外国进行经济、技术合作。他欢迎外国各界人士来中国参观访问，以增进对中国的了解。“百闻不如一见”。要了解实际情况，最好还是来中国看看。
    李鹏还回答了客人们就当前国际形势所提出的一些问题。李鹏在谈话中积极评价了正在进行的这次国际研讨会，并感谢与会各国朋友对中国经济工作所提出的建设性建议。
    与会外国朋友们表示，看到中国改革开放政策不变感到十分欣慰，并表示愿意以积极态度进一步探讨进行合作的途径和渠道。一位与会经济学家说，中国的治理整顿政策是成功的，他希望这些政策能继续贯彻执行。会见时，国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心总干事马洪在座。
      “坚持改革开放、扩大对外经济合作”国际研讨会是昨天开幕的。来自英国、加拿大、联邦德国、美国和日本等国以及香港地区的金融界、企业界著名人士出席了会议。
