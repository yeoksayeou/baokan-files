There is a well-known "old commander" in a unit of the Shenyang Military Region. In fact, he never served as a commander. To be precise, he is a retired deputy regimental-level officer named Xu Dezheng.

To address the issue of insufficient heating fuel for the troops, two years ago, Xu Dezheng led a team of eight people with two tents to settle in a desolate area of the Black Treasure Mountain coal mine in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province.

With the approval of local authorities, they adopted a method of building roads, raising funds, and mining coal simultaneously to establish a coal mine. Over the past two years, with the support of the Black Treasure Mountain coal mine, the coal mine under Xu Dezheng's management has initially formed a medium-sized coal mine with relatively complete technical personnel and equipment, and fixed assets of 280,000 yuan. In the first half of this year, it produced 19,000 tons of coal, generating a profit of 350,000 yuan.

The Black Treasure Mountain mining area, which was developed just five years ago, lacks water, and the water is deficient in calcium. There are no green vegetables throughout the year. During the two years of hard work, Xu Dezheng and the soldiers often ate fried soybeans and pickled vegetables. Sometimes, by the pot of soup with only a few vegetable leaves, Xu Dezheng jokingly called himself the "salvage team leader."

Black Treasure Mountain is located deep in the dense forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains. In winter, the biting cold wind blows, and in summer, mosquitoes swarm everywhere. From the construction of the road and mine to the present, Xu Dezheng has always lived in a tent.

One summer, Nenjiang experienced heavy rain, and at night, the water in the tent rose to half a meter deep. Xu Dezheng's bed collapsed, and he jumped into the water to dig a ditch to drain it.

The mine leadership, upon hearing the news, advised him, "Old Xu, stay at our guesthouse. It won't cost you anything." He insisted on living with the soldiers.

Although Xu Dezheng holds the financial power of the coal mine, he never spends a single penny recklessly. Once, a young soldier named Wang accompanied "Old Commander" on a business trip, thinking that traveling with "Old Commander" would be trouble-free.

However, every time they went out on business, they either walked or took the bus. "Old Commander" humorously told Wang, "This way, we exercise and save money."

"Two sleeves clean" is Xu Dezheng's motto.

One day, a local official specially came from another place to the coal mine and gave Xu Dezheng 500 yuan as a bribe.

Xu Dezheng took the money and said sternly, "You and I both hold some power. Today you give me 500 yuan, and tomorrow I might ask you for 1,000 yuan. This would turn into a monetary relationship. I never engage in monetary transactions."

    廉洁自律的“老团长”
    ——记沈阳军区某部退休军官徐德证
    秦彦宁　张彬生
    沈阳军区某部有位响当当的
  “老团长”，其实，他没当过团长。
    确切地说是一名退了休的副团职军官，他叫徐德证。
    为解决部队取暖燃料不足等问题，两年前徐德证带着两顶帐篷8个人，成为黑龙江省嫩江县黑宝山煤矿一处荒僻的草垫子中的落户人。
    经当地有关部门同意，他们采取边修路、边集资、边开采的办法，建点挖煤。
    两年来，在黑宝山煤矿的支援下，徐德证所负责的煤矿初步形成一座技术人员和设备较齐全、有固定资产28万元的次中型煤矿。今年上半年出煤1.9万吨，创利35万元。
    5年前才开发的黑宝山矿区，人缺水，水缺钙，一年四季无青菜。艰苦创业这两年，徐德证和官兵一样，常常是煎黄豆、啃咸菜，有时在仅有几片菜叶的汤锅旁，徐德证开玩笑自封为
  “打捞队队长”。
    黑宝山位于大兴安岭深山密林之中，冬天寒风刺骨吹，夏天小咬到处飞。从修路建矿至今，徐德征一直住帐篷。
    一年夏天，嫩江连降暴雨，夜晚帐篷中进水半尺多深，徐德证的床塌了，他跳到水里，挖沟排水。
    煤矿领导闻讯劝他：“老徐，住我们招待所吧，不收费。”他仍然坚持与士兵住在一起。
    徐德证虽然手握煤矿财政大权，却从不乱花一分钱。一次通信员小王因公随“老团长”出差，心想，跟“老团长”出去肯定没错。
    可每次出门办事，他们不是两腿走，就是挤公共汽车。“老团长”风趣地对小王说：“这样既健身又省钱。”
      “两袖清风”是徐德证的“座右铭”。
    一天，地方一位干部专程从外地赶到煤矿，送给徐德证500元好处费。
    徐德证拿起钱严肃地说：
  “你我都掌握一部分权力，今天你找我时给500，明天我去求你时给1000。这不成了金钱关系？金钱交易的事我从来不干。”
