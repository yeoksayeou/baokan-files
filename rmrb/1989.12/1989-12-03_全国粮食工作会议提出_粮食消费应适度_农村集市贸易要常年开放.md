The national grain work conference, which concluded today in Beijing, noted that the grain and oil production and procurement situation this year is better than originally anticipated. However, the problems that exist in the latter part of the year remain severe. While seizing the opportunity to actively procure, all regions must also thoroughly and comprehensively carry out the "double increase and double save" campaign.

Minister of Commerce Hu Ping and Deputy Minister He Jihai stated that to promote grain savings, it is necessary to advocate for moderate consumption, guide civilized consumption, restrict high consumption, and oppose waste. Rural market trade should be open year-round and not closed.

Hu Ping said that in recent years, under the influence of high consumption in society, grain consumption has rapidly expanded, and the growth of feed and brewing grain has been too fast and too strong. In 1988, China's per capita consumption of meat, eggs, dairy, and aquatic products reached 29.3 kilograms, an increase of 6 kilograms compared to 1984; the per capita consumption of various types of alcohol was 11.5 kilograms, an increase of 5 kilograms compared to 1984. These two items combined result in an average increase of 19.3 kilograms of grain consumption per person, equivalent to more than a month's worth of rations. This level is not high compared to developed countries, but China's current grain situation is only at the subsistence level and cannot afford to eat too well or drink too much. Therefore, consumption must be moderate. In organizing grain supply work, there must be both supply and control, and it is not possible to meet all demands.

Hu Ping said that the phenomenon of wasting grain on the dining table is also heartbreaking. While making great efforts to promote grain production, we must also make great efforts to promote the spiritual civilization of grain consumption, popularizing knowledge of civilized and scientific grain consumption.

He Jihai said that rural market trade should be open year-round, and management should be strengthened. Except for rice, which continues to be procured by the grain department, other contracted varieties should complete the contracted tasks at the county level and then allow for multi-channel operations.

### 全国粮食工作会议提出  粮食消费应适度  农村集市贸易要常年开放

    全国粮食工作会议提出
    粮食消费应适度
    农村集市贸易要常年开放
    本报北京12月2日讯　记者潘岗报道：今天在此间结束的全国粮食工作会议指出，今年粮油生产收购形势比原来预料的好，但后一段存在的问题仍很严峻。各地要在抓住有利时机积极收购的同时，扎扎实实地全面深入开展“双增双节”运动。
    商业部部长胡平、副部长何济海说，开展节约用粮，要提倡适度消费，引导文明消费，限制高消费，反对浪费。农村集市贸易要常年开放，不要关闭。
    胡平说，近几年来，在社会上高消费的影响下，粮食消费急剧膨胀，饲料和酿酒用粮增长过快过猛。1988年，我国人均肉、蛋、奶、水产品的消费量达29.3公斤，比1984年增加6公斤；各类酒的消费量人均11.5公斤，比1984年增加5公斤。这两项合计，平均每人增加粮食消费19.3公斤，合一个多月的口粮。这个水平与发达国家相比不算高，但是我国粮食的现状只是温饱水平，不能吃得太好，喝得太多。因此，只能适度消费。在组织粮食供应工作中，要有保有压，不能有求必应。
    胡平说，餐桌上浪费粮食的现象也令人痛心。在下大力气抓粮食生产的同时，也要下大力气抓粮食消费上的精神文明建设，进行粮食文明消费、科学消费的知识普及。
    何济海说，农村集市贸易要常年开放，同时要加强管理。除大米继续执行由粮食部门统一收购的规定外，其它定购品种，坚持以县为单位完成定购任务后，允许多渠道经营。
