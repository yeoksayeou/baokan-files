On the eve of the 1990s, the situation in the Middle East remains a prominent issue in global regional conflicts, characterized by its sharp, complex, and volatile nature. Compared to previous years, the situation in the region has shown signs of easing, but the core issue of the Palestinian problem remains in a stalemate.

This intertwined state of easing and stalemate indicates that there is hope for a political resolution to the Middle East conflicts, but it also suggests that breaking the stalemate will require a prolonged and arduous effort.

Over the past year, the driving forces behind the easing of the Middle East situation have come from three main directions:

Firstly, Arab countries have gradually moved towards national unity, adopting a moderate, realistic, and continuously coordinated stance in handling internal and external affairs as the world's easing trend progresses. In May, the Arab League's special summit in Casablanca restored Egypt's membership. Relations between many deeply estranged Arab countries, particularly between Libya and Egypt, and Egypt and Syria, have shown clear signs of improvement. This marks the end of a decade-long serious split within the Arab world. Arab countries have collectively established a realistic stance of resolving the Palestinian issue through political means. The Arab League has for the first time included UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 in its official documents, thereby advancing the unified Arab position from the Fez Resolution. On key issues such as actively supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people, accepting the reality of Israel's existence, strongly demanding the convening of an international peace conference for the Middle East, and the just resolution of the Middle East issue, the Arab countries' steps are largely in unison.

Secondly, as a key party in the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has continued its efforts towards a political solution since announcing the establishment of a Palestinian state neighboring Israel at the end of last year. Chairman Arafat publicly announced in May in France that the 1964 Palestinian Charter "is outdated." The dominant faction of the PLO, Fatah, at its 5th Congress, affirmed the peace strategy. The PLO, on one hand, continues to organize and support the uprising in the occupied territories, striking at Israeli aggression; on the other hand, it uses the uprising as a basis to adopt flexible strategies, accepting suggestions for elections in the occupied territories and direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. However, it engages in a head-to-head political struggle with Israel and the United States on key issues such as the PLO's representative rights and the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.

Thirdly, with the general cooling of regional conflicts worldwide, the prolonged stalemate over the Palestinian issue has become more pronounced, and international efforts to promote peace have intensified. The Chinese government proposed five points in October to advance the Middle East peace process, supporting the convening of an international peace conference for the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and relevant parties. It also supports holding direct Palestinian-Israeli talks to achieve this goal. The "Troika" of Western European foreign ministers made two rounds of visits to the Middle East this year, exploring the possibilities and ways for the Arab and Israeli positions to converge. Their stance has clearly distanced itself from Israel. Especially after Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's visit to Europe, Western European countries have raised their criticism of Israel's rigid stance. In various international conferences and United Nations meetings, support for the Palestinian people's struggle has strengthened, while Israel has become increasingly isolated. Although the easing trend in the Middle East has been driven by various international efforts, an important turning point was also seen last year, the peace process has not yet achieved a breakthrough. The crux of the matter lies in the Israeli government's rigid stance, unwilling to make genuine compromises and concessions, while the United States also tends to maintain the status quo, unwilling to exert necessary pressure on Israel to achieve a fundamental resolution of the Palestinian issue.

In the first half of this year, the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and Israel visited the United States in succession, and Israeli Prime Minister Shamir proposed an election plan for the occupied territories, marking the beginning of a new round of political maneuvering in the Middle East. The core content of the Shamir plan did not go beyond its insistence on the concept of Palestinian autonomy, naturally facing rejection from the PLO and the Arab League. Egypt, based on the Shamir plan, proposed a 10-point peace plan, advocating direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. The United States also put forward the related Baker Five Points. Thus, the Middle East peace process shifted from calling for the convening of an international conference to the theme of preparing for direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.

In the second half of the year, the Middle East political stage revolved around the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, with repeated behind-the-scenes negotiations. Israeli Defense Minister Rabin visited Cairo, agreeing to Egypt's convening of the dialogue. The Israeli cabinet then split seriously. However, the two factions within the cabinet are united in their fundamental stance on dialogue, interlocutors, and the content of the dialogue, that is, firmly rejecting the PLO and limiting the dialogue to only discussing the election issue. The PLO insists that dialogue and elections are only part of the comprehensive solution, ultimately requiring the convening of an international conference. The PLO has the right to form a delegation, and there are no preconditions for the dialogue. The Egyptian government, as the first to advocate dialogue, frequently conveyed messages between the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel, seeking to open the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue channel after the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue, urging the United States to pressure Israel to accept; while the United States, in turn, wants Egypt to pressure the PLO to make further concessions on the issue of representation, clearly aiming to bring the dialogue back to its old path of separate resolution.

So far, although the door to direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue has not been completely closed, various mediation activities are still ongoing, but the gap between the Palestinian and Israeli positions seems to be considerable, and a new stalemate has emerged. Although the four parties (Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and the United States) have repeatedly discussed the relevant content of the dialogue, the general view is that if Israel does not relax its stance, the current stalemate is difficult to break through in the short term.

The strategic importance of the Middle East determines its sensitive connection with the global situation. The Bush administration's "small steps" Middle East policy serves its overall strategic considerations, with the current diplomatic focus still on Europe, advocating the maintenance of the status quo in the Middle East, that is, maintaining the momentum of Middle East peace talks, allowing the Middle East peace talks to move forward at a slow pace under conditions favorable to its control. This is the essence of the Baker Five Points. The four principles proposed by the United States at the beginning of this year for solving the Middle East problem, although somewhat changed from the past and seemingly more "neutral," still have not deviated from the old track of favoring Israel.

In contrast, the Soviet Union's influence in the Middle East has weakened and is shrinking. Arab public opinion analyzes that, constrained by the situation in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union has little room for new moves in the Middle East. The Soviet Union no longer uses the progress of the Middle East peace process as a condition to constrain its relations with Israel, rapidly developing its ties with Israel, which has caused concern for the PLO.

Looking ahead to the situation in the Middle East, the general view is that only by achieving mutual recognition between the State of Palestine and the State of Israel, and by the Arab and Jewish peoples living in peace, can the situation in the Middle East truly stabilize.

    缓和与僵持交织
    ——中东和平进程一年回顾
    本报记者　林皎明
    跨入90年代前夕，中东地区形势仍以尖锐、复杂、动荡的特点在世界地区争端中占据着重要地位。与前些年相比，今年该地区局势有趋向缓和的势头，但以巴勒斯坦问题为核心的地区主要矛盾，依然处于僵持阶段。
    这种缓和与僵持交织的状态，既表明中东争端有接近政治解决的希望，也预示僵局的突破还需要一段时间的艰难努力。
    过去的一年中，中东形势向缓和方向发展的动力主要来自3个方面：
    其一，阿拉伯各国随着世界的缓和激流逐步走向民族团结，用温和、现实和不断协调的立场处理阿拉伯内外事务。5月份在卡萨布兰卡召开的阿拉伯特别首脑会议恢复了埃及的阿盟成员国资格。诸多积怨甚深的阿拉伯国家关系，特别是利比亚与埃及、埃及与叙利亚的双边关系，明显地趋向缓解。这标志着阿拉伯世界结束了长达10年之久的严重分裂状态。阿拉伯国家共同确立了通过政治途径解决巴勒斯坦问题的现实立场。阿盟将联合国安理会242、338号决议首次写进正式文件，从而使阿拉伯国家的统一立场从非斯决议又向前迈出一步。在积极支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争，事实上接受以色列国存在的现实，强烈要求召开中东和平国际会议和公正解决中东问题等关键问题上，阿拉伯国家的步调基本上是一致的。
    其二，作为阿以争端的重要一方，巴勒斯坦解放组织继去年底宣布建立与以色列为邻的巴勒斯坦国之后，继续沿着政治解决的方向努力。阿拉法特主席5月在法国公开宣布，1964年制定的巴勒斯坦宪章“已经过时”。巴解主流派法塔赫第5次代表大会肯定了和平战略。巴解组织一方面继续组织和声援被占领土起义，打击以色列的侵略势力；另一方面，又以起义为依托，采取灵活策略，接过被占领土选举和巴以直接对话的建议，但在坚持巴解组织的代表权，坚持巴勒斯坦民族自决权等要害问题上与以色列、美国展开针锋相对的政治斗争。
    其三，随着全球地区争端热点普遍降温，巴勒斯坦问题久拖不决的状况相对突出，国际社会的促和努力不断加强。中国政府10月间提出推动中东和平进程的5点主张，支持召开联合国主持下有5个常任理事国和有关各方参加的中东和平国际会议，支持为实现此目标而举行的巴以直接对话。西欧外长的“三驾马车”今年两次巡回中东，探寻阿以立场接近的可能性及途径。其立场明显与以色列拉开距离。特别是在以色列总理顺访欧洲后，西欧国家批评以色列僵硬立场的调子提高。在各种的国际会议和联合国会议上，对巴勒斯坦人民斗争的支持在加强，而以色列则日益陷于孤立。尽管中东的缓和趋势有国际社会的各方推动，去年也出现过重要转折，但和平进程至今没有取得突破。症结在于以色列政府立场僵硬，不肯做出真正的妥协和让步，而美国也倾向于维持现状，不肯对以色列施加必要的压力，促使巴勒斯坦问题获得根本解决。
    今年上半年，埃及、约旦、以色列3国领导人先后出访美国，以色列总理提出被占领土选举计划，开始了今年中东政治较量的新回合。沙米尔计划的核心内容，没有超出它固守的巴勒斯坦自治概念，自然遭到巴解组织和阿盟的拒绝。埃及在沙米尔计划的基础上提出10点和平计划，主张巴以直接对话。美国也提出有关的贝克5点建议。由此，中东和平进程由呼吁召开国际会议转向筹备巴以直接对话的主题。
    下半年，中东政治舞台围绕巴以对话展开幕前幕后的反复讨价还价。以色列国防部长拉宾出访开罗，同意由埃及召集对话。以色列内阁随之严重分裂。但是，以内阁两派在对话、对象和对话内容的根本立场上一致，即坚决排斥巴解、限定对话只谈选举问题。巴解组织则坚持，对话和选举只是全面解决的一部分，最终要召开国际会议。巴解有权组团，对话无先决条件。埃及政府首倡对话，频繁在巴与美、以之间传递信息，争取在美巴对话之后打开以巴对话渠道，要美国促以接受；而美国又反过来要埃及压巴解在代表权上再做让步，明显是想把对话纳入它的单独解决的老路。
    到目前为止，巴以直接对话的大门虽然没有关死，各方的斡旋活动仍在进行，但巴以立场看来还有相当距离，处于新态势下的僵持局面。尽管巴、以、埃、美4方在对话的有关建议内容上反复探讨，但一般看法是，以色列如不松动立场，目前僵局很难短期突破。
    中东的重要战略地位决定了它与世界全局的敏感联系。美国布什政府“小步走”的中东政策，服从于它的全盘战略考虑，目前的外交重点仍在欧洲，对于欧洲侧翼的中东则主张维持现状，即保持中东的和谈势头，让中东和谈车轮在有利于它把握主导权的情势下不紧不慢地转动。这是贝克5点建议的实质含义。美国今年年初提出的解决中东问题的4项原则，虽然比以往有所变化，似乎表现得“中立”一些，却仍然没有脱离偏袒以色列的旧轨道。
    对比之下，苏联在中东地区的影响力减弱，趋于收缩。阿拉伯舆论分析，受东欧态势的牵制，苏联在中东难有新的动作。苏联不再提以中东和平进程的积极变化为条件制约苏以关系，大步发展与以色列的联系，引起巴解组织的忧虑。
    展望中东地区形势，人们普遍的看法是，只有实现巴勒斯坦国和以色列国相互承认，阿拉伯民族和犹太民族和平共处，才能使中东局势真正稳定下来。
