The Site of the Mediterranean Summit Between U.S. and Soviet Leaders – Two Missile Cruisers

The U.S. "Belknap" missile cruiser is the flagship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. The ship is 166 meters long and has a displacement of 7,900 tons. It is equipped with four 85,000-horsepower steam engines, has a cruising speed of about 62 kilometers per hour, and has advanced equipment and sophisticated weapons.

The "Belknap" began service in 1964 and has been in service for 25 years. To participate in this U.S.-Soviet summit, the ship underwent 500,000 man-hours of maintenance by French technicians and workers at the Toulon naval anchorage in France, and its hull was repainted.

The Soviet "Slava" missile cruiser is 187 meters long, 21 meters wide, and has a displacement of 11,000 tons. The entire crew consists of over 500 personnel.

The "Slava" entered service on January 30, 1983, and has been in service for just over six years. On November 24, it departed from the Sevastopol naval base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, escorted by the "Prosvetleniye" frigate, heading for the Mediterranean.

On the morning of December 2, due to high winds and rough seas in the Mediterranean, the first round of talks scheduled to be held on the "Slava" missile cruiser were changed to be held on the Soviet "Gorky" passenger ship.

    美苏首脑地中海会晤的场所
    ——两艘导弹巡洋舰
    美国的“贝尔纳普”号导弹巡洋舰是美国在地中海的海军第6舰队的旗舰，船身长166米，吨位为7900吨，船上装有4台85000马力的蒸气机，航行时速约62公里，船上设备先进，武器精良。
    “贝尔纳普”号于1964年开始服役，军龄已达25年。为参加这次美苏首脑会晤，该舰在法国的土伦海军锚地由法国技术人员和工人用了50万个工时进行了检修，并将船身油漆一新。
    苏联的“光荣”号导弹巡洋舰船身长187米，宽21米，排水量为1.1万吨，全舰官兵500多名。
    “光荣”号于1983年1月30日编队服役，军龄刚6年多。11月24日，它由“求知”号护卫舰护航离开苏联黑海舰队基地的塞瓦斯托波尔军港驶往地中海。
    12月2日上午，由于地中海上风大浪高，原定在“光荣”号导弹巡洋舰上举行的第一轮会谈改在苏联的“高尔基”号客轮上举行。
