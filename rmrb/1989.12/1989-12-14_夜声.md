In the morning, my wife stands in front of the mirror, carefully plucking a strand of white hair.

I didn't disturb her; I stepped back a few paces and stood silently in the kitchen. It seemed as if I could hear that faint, crisp sound.

Time doesn't arrive with a thunderous roar; it peels away bit by bit. And people, it's only in the early morning that they notice the frost on their hair, and then they are startled by the cruelty of the days.

My wife is so calm that it makes me restless.

The gas stove is polished to the point where it reflects facial hair. The window glass is so clean that it adds a double layer of transparency to the spring colors. My wife often has back pain, but she laughs and scolds me for only being able to write the word "clean," while she climbs onto a bamboo stool, leaning against the cabinet, breathing on the glass, and wiping it with old face mask gauze.

Every time I return home to the fifth-floor apartment, I gently tap my shoes, and the dust on my heart naturally falls off.

Two small dishes of vegetables, steaming with heat, one spicy and one meaty, catering to the tastes of father and son. The factory's lunch break is short, so my wife buys six steamed buns on the way, and mixes them with a full bowl of soup, making a hearty lunch. My son excitedly talks about interesting things that happened at school, and my mother corrects those unnecessary actions during meals. I, on the other hand, immerse myself in the music from my pocket-sized tape player, mostly repeating Nikolaos Anagnostopoulos' guitar piece "People's Dreams," never tiring of it. Sometimes, I also pretend, pretending that the lies mixed in with my literary thoughts. Without putting on those orange earphones, I lose the shield of lying. Literature purifies people, but it also corrupts them. I can't guarantee that in my unrestrained dreams, I won't sing out some truths that will hurt my wife's pure heart, which is sleepless. But every dawn, what I get is her defenseless, serene smile.

During the Spring Festival of the Year of the Snake, we returned to Tianjin to visit relatives. The three of us went to send my wife's co-worker's sister some things. Perhaps the sister has poor eyesight and is unfamiliar, but as soon as she saw us, she repeatedly praised: "Sister Zheng, although you are thin, your two sons are so handsome!"

My wife smiled awkwardly and explained, but my heart was filled with tears. Women, after all, consume more than men.

At night, the television announced that there would be a Taiwanese show, "Stars Know My Heart," which my wife loves to watch every episode. But tonight, she voluntarily changed the channel: "You watch the soccer match." I was puzzled, and my wife's eyes looked away, saying softly: "Fifi's mother is going to die tonight..."

My wife sits on the chair, with a sponge pillow behind her back, knitting a dark green sweater, for the son of a comrade-in-arms who introduced us. He lost his wife in his prime, and it was while watching "Among the People" that he had a heart attack. She was a model employee at a state-run store, and when sorting out her belongings, she found a notice from the municipal hospital recommending hospitalization.

After her death, there was not a single memorial article.

The bamboo needles click rhythmically against the bookshelf beside her, tap... tap... This sound clearly drowned out the clamor and excitement on the screen.

The dark green color is growing inch by inch, almost reaching the collar. My wife said that the pattern of this sweater is a net stitch.

    夜声
    赵中森
    晨，妻在穿衣镜前，细心地在捉那根白发。
    我没打扰她，退了几步，在厨房默立，耳畔仿佛有那一缕清脆的响。
    岁月，不是訇然而至，它丝丝缕缕地剥落着自己。而人，又总在一日清早发觉了发梢的霜霰，才暗惊日子的残酷。
    妻，平静得让我不平静呵。
    煤气炉擦得能显示须眉的真。窗玻璃让春天的色泽多了双层的透明。妻总腰疼，却一面笑着嗔怨我日子中仅字儿能写洁净，一面扶着橱柜登上竹椅，朝玻璃哈气，用拆散的旧口罩纱布一扇扇地揩。
    每每登临五层楼的家门，总轻轻跺下鞋子，心扉上的灰尘自然也抖落了许多。
    两碟儿青菜，蒸发着热气，一辣一荤，各对父子的口味。工厂午饭时间短，妻途中买回六只馒头，再用汤料冲了满满一碗，构成了丰盛的午餐。儿子兴奋地说起校园的趣事，母亲在关键时分纠正那些饭时多余的动作。我，则埋入袖珍录放机的音乐中，多是反复地听尼古拉·安捷罗斯的吉他曲《人们的梦》，总也听不腻。有时，也为掩饰，掩饰那羼杂入文学构思的谎话。不戴上那桔红耳机，便失去了扯谎的盾。文学，净化人，也污染人。我不能保证，无羁的梦呓中不会吟出些真，刺伤失眠的妻那颗纯净的心。而每一黎明所得到的，又偏偏是那毫无设防的恬笑。
    己巳春节回津探亲，三口人去送妻同车间老乡给姐家带的东西。许是那姐姐视力不佳，又生疏，一见面，连声地夸：郑姐，你虽瘦弱，你这俩儿子养得多漂亮哇！
    妻尴尬地笑着解释，我心间却有了泪，女人呵，总比男人太多的消耗。
    入夜，电视预告有台湾的《星星知我心》，妻每集皆爱看，今却主动换了频道，你看足球赛吧。我不解，妻的眼睛躲开，很轻一句：秀秀妈，今晚要死了……
    妻坐在椅上，背上塞一只海棉枕，正织一件墨绿色毛衣，是给为我们牵了红丝线的战友之子织的。他中年丧妻，是看《人世间》心脏病发作。她是国营店的模范营业员，整理遗物时，发现市职工医院开的建议住院的单子。
    她死后，没有任何纪念的文字。
    竹针有规律地击着一旁的书架，啪嗒……啪嗒……这声音分明压过了屏幕上的喧嚣与骚动。
    那墨绿色正一分一分地增长着，已近领口了，妻说过，这毛衣的图案是网眼。
