It has been ten years since Comrade Yuanqing passed away, but the memories he left me are as vivid as if they happened yesterday.

I first met Yuanqing in Yan'an. He was in the Music Department, and I was in the Drama Department, so we didn't have much interaction. At that time, my impression of him was that of a diligent and serious cellist. We had more contact after moving to Beijing. I was at the Chinese Opera Research Institute, and he was at the Music Research Institute of the Central Conservatory of Music. Our work had some similarities, so we had some exchanges and mutual learning. His institute was quite distinctive, with meticulous work on materials; another point was the use of instruments for research. These characteristics were areas where I felt we were far behind, and I really wanted to learn from them, but I always felt like I couldn't catch up. I visited their exhibition hall and materials room several times and always felt that the colleagues in this department managed everything in an orderly and scientific manner. It turned out that Yuanqing's personal research style was like this, and he played a leading role in this aspect. Yuanqing's articles and administrative work were all practical and down-to-earth. He worked silently and diligently, so the institute accomplished much more than they publicized. It could also be said that they did almost no publicity, so many people, especially those outside the music industry, knew very little about them. After I became familiar with these internal affairs, I developed a deep respect for Yuanqing.

Yuanqing studied Western music and specialized in instrumental music. Later, due to work needs, he was assigned to the position of researching national music. In general, it seemed like he was not using his strengths; in the old days, those who studied Western music often looked down on national music, but Yuanqing threw himself into this position with great enthusiasm and opened up a new situation, uniting a group of music researchers and achieving many results. In this regard, he himself took the lead. Recently, I read his posthumous works, such as the article "Research on the Guanzi," and deeply felt that he was very serious about delving into folk research. If he did not highly value the cultural heritage of national music, such research enthusiasm would not have been possible.

Yuanqing was a party member and had been tempered by the spirit of the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. He not only threw himself into the revolution at a time of national crisis but also concretized his ideal of loving the country and building a socialist new China in his music career, taking the research, promotion, and innovation of national music as his mission, and opening up a new situation, setting an example for future generations. In this regard, it is always worth learning from.

    忆李元庆
    张庚
    元庆同志去世已经十年了，但他留给我的记忆却历历如在目前。
    我和元庆认识是在延安。他在音乐系，我在戏剧系，接触不多。那时我对他的印象，是一个勤奋认真的大提琴家。接触较多是到了北京之后，我在中国戏曲研究院，他在中央音乐学院音乐研究所。我们的工作性质有相近之处，因此有些来往，互相学习，交换意见。他的研究所办得很有特色，资料工作做得细致考究；还有一点就是使用仪器进行研究。以上的特点，是我感到我们远远不及他们的地方，很想努力向他们学习，但总觉追不上。我几次去参观他们的展览室和资料室，都感到做这部门工作的同志管理得井井有条、十分科学，原来元庆本人的研究工作作风就是这样，在这方面起了带头作用。元庆的文章，他的行政工作，都是不尚空谈、实事求是的。他埋头默默地干，所以这个研究所干的事比他们对外面的宣传多得多；也可以说，几乎不做什么宣传，因此外面的人，特别是音乐界以外的人知道的很少。我熟悉了这些内情以后，对元庆油然生出了一种敬佩心。
    元庆是学西洋音乐的，而且专攻器乐，后来由于工作需要分配在研究民族音乐的岗位上，在一般人看来，似乎用非所长；在旧时代，学西洋音乐的人，很少看得起民族音乐，而元庆在这个岗位上却热情洋溢地一头扎进去，开创了一个新局面，团结了一批音乐研究家，做出了不少的成绩。在这方面，他自己是带头做的。最近我翻读他的遗作，像《管子研究》这样的文章，深感到他是十分认真地深入到民间去研究的。如果不是非常重视民族音乐文化遗产，这样的研究热情是不会有的。
    元庆是党员，又经过延安文艺座谈会精神的淘洗，他不仅能在国家危亡的紧急关头投身革命，还能把爱国家，建设社会主义新中国的理想具体化在他的音乐业务上，以研究、发扬、革新民族音乐为己任，而且开创了局面，给后来者做出了榜样。在这方面，是永远值得我们学习的。
