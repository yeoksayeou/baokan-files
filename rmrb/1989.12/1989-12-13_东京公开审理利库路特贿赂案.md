Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 11th.

The Tokyo District Court today publicly tried the Recruit bribery case, focusing on the bribery of officials from the Ministry of Education and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT).

The court convened at 10 AM. The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office read out the indictment against former Vice-Minister of Education Takashi Koseki, former NTT President Toshihiko Tanaka, and former NTT Director Shigeo Shibakawa.

The indictment stated that Koseki and Tanaka purchased 10,000 shares each of Recruit Cosmos Inc. stock at a low price, while Shibakawa purchased 5,000 shares. They allegedly used their positions to provide favors to Recruit Cosmos, constituting a bribery offense. The prosecution confirmed that the bribery amount for each share was 2270 yen, totaling 22.7 million yen for Koseki and Tanaka, and 11.35 million yen for Shibakawa.

The eight defendants admitted in court to purchasing unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos but denied the allegations of bribery and providing favors to the company. They all pleaded not guilty.

The Recruit bribery case is one of the largest scandals in post-war Japan. The main actor, Recruit Company, colluded with political and bureaucratic circles, engaging in bribery and mutual benefit. The case involves numerous political figures, including former Prime Ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and Sosuke Uno. During the investigation, 14 people were arrested, and one person committed suicide.

The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation on May 29th and filed charges with the court. On November 24th, the Tokyo District Court publicly tried the bribery case involving Recruit Company and the Ministry of Labor. Former Vice-Minister of Labor Kazuo Kato denied the bribery allegations.

Today's court session also involved the trial of a manager from a subsidiary of Recruit Company, Hiroshi Kobayashi, who provided funds for the purchase of the shares.

Local observers believe that the Recruit bribery case is extensive and complex, and its trial will be protracted.

    东京公开审理利库路特贿赂案
    新华社东京12月11日电  （记者蒋豫浙）日本东京地方法院今天公开审理利库路特贿赂案中文部省和日本电信电话公司负责人的受贿问题。
    法院今天上午10时开庭。东京地方检察厅宣读了对原文部省次官高石邦男、原日本电信电话公司董事长谷川寿彦和式场英的起诉书。
    起诉书说，高石和长谷川被告低价分别购进利库路特宇宙公司股票1万股，式场被告购进5000股，并利用职权为利库路特公司提供了方便，构成受贿罪。检察当局确认，购进每一股股票的受贿金额为2270 日元，高石和长谷川被告的受贿额是2270万日元，式场被告的受贿额是1135万日元。
    8名被告在法庭承认，曾购买利库路特宇宙公司的未公开股票，并认为接受这种股票有负国民的信赖，但对股票的贿赂性和曾为利库路特公司提供方便的检察当局的起诉进行了全面的否认。被告均申辩自己无罪。
    利库路特贿赂案是日本战后较大的丑闻之一。此案的主角利库路特公司与政界、官界相互勾结，行贿受贿，彼此受益。这一案件涉及众多政界要人，包括前首相中曾根康弘和竹下登等。在该案的调查过程中，有14人被逮捕，1人自杀。
    东京地方检察厅于今年5月29日结束调查工作，向法院提出起诉。东京地方法院11月24日公开审理了利库路特案中的利库路特公司和劳动省之间的行贿受贿问题。原劳动省次官加藤孝对受贿一事进行了否认。
    今天法院公审的还有为购买股票提供资金的利库路特公司的一家子公司负责人小林宏。
    此间人士认为，利库路特贿赂案涉及面广，案情复杂，该案的审理将是旷日持久的。
