	Suggestions on Selecting and Reading Mao Zedong's Philosophical Works
	Editor Comrades:

	Recently, the *People's Daily* and other newspapers have reprinted Mao Zedong's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," which is excellent. The annotations used are from the text of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*. I believe that using the revised annotation text from the newly compiled *Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong* (two-volume edition, 1986) would be more appropriate. For example, the annotation introducing Norman Bethune's life has added his birth and death years (1890–1939), which allows readers to understand that the statement in the text that Bethune was "over 50 years old" is not entirely accurate (at that time, there was no way to verify this, and now there is no need to modify the original text; an explanation in the annotation is sufficient). The new annotation also corrects several inaccuracies in the old annotation regarding time, place, and historical facts, which, although not crucial, are better when more accurate.

	The newly compiled edition of *Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong* is intended to provide the broad masses of cadres and youth with Mao Zedong's most important and fundamental scientific works. The selected articles range from 1921 to 1965; the prefaces and annotations are based on the original text of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, with many revisions and additions. When we study Mao Zedong's works now, we should, of course, use the annotations from the newly compiled edition of the selected readings as much as possible. Unfortunately, many of our comrades are not yet familiar with this newly compiled edition and have not noticed that its annotations have been carefully revised and supplemented, making scientific progress over the previous edition.

	Recently, the Central Committee has called for the study of Marxist philosophy and requires that Mao Zedong's philosophical works be included in the key study list. Where can we find these works? Of course, it is good to find them in the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, because the collection has been widely circulated and is relatively easy to find, and it contains most of the major works. However, there are some works that were not included, such as the important work "Oppose Book Worship" (1930), "Freedom is the Recognition of Necessity and the Transformation of the World" (1941), and several philosophical short articles written in the 1960s ("Where Do Correct Ideas for the Masses Come From?" and a set of five texts on the epistemology and dialectics of learning Marxism). The newly compiled edition of *Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong* pays attention to selecting the philosophical works already included in the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* and military works that fully embody philosophical brilliance (such as the full text of "On Protracted War"), and also includes the aforementioned philosophical works that were not included in the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*. Therefore, I suggest informing comrades who want to study philosophy and find Mao Zedong's related works: the newly compiled edition of *Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong* provides them with a more complete collection; its annotations, in addition to being more accurate, also provide new information, such as a new annotation for "On Practice," explaining that Mao Zedong intended to revise an inappropriate phrase in the original text.

	I also suggest that our publishing and distribution agencies print a large number of copies of the newly compiled edition of *Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong*, making it a must-read and essential book for the broad masses of cadres. This way, we can also avoid the waste of printing caused by separately printing large quantities of different aspects or themes.

	I take this opportunity to convey this suggestion to the broad readership and publishing and distribution departments through your newspaper.

	Yours sincerely,
	Gōng Yùzhī

### 关于选读毛泽东哲学著作的一点建议

    关于选读毛泽东哲学著作的一点建议
    编辑同志：
    前些天《人民日报》及其他报纸重新发表毛泽东《纪念白求恩》一文，很好。所用注释，是《毛泽东选集》的文本，我认为，以选用《毛泽东著作选读》（1986年新编的两卷本）而经过修订的注释文本，更为得宜。即以介绍白求恩生平的这条注释为例：新注释增写了白求恩的生卒年（1890—1939），这就可以使读者了解正文中白求恩“50多岁了”的说法不是很准确的（当时没有条件去核实，现在没有必要去修改正文，注释中作出交代就行了）。新注释还纠正了旧注释中几处关于时间、地点、史实的不够准确的叙述，虽都无关宏旨，准确一些总是更好。
    《毛泽东著作选读》新编本，是为现在广大干部和青年提供毛泽东的最重要、最基本的科学著作而编选出版的。其篇目，起自1921年，迄于1965年；其题解和注释，以《毛泽东选集》原来的文本为基础，作了不少修订和增补。我们现在学习毛泽东著作，在选用注释的时候，当然应该尽可能用选读新编本的注释。可惜我们许多同志还不大熟悉这个新编本，没有注意到它的注释作了过细的修订增补，在科学性上较前又有了进步。
    最近中央号召学习马克思主义哲学，并要求把毛泽东哲学著作列入重点学习的书目。到哪里去找这些著作？到《毛泽东选集》里去找当然好，因为选集过去发行量很大，较易找到，而且那里面主要的著作都有。但也有未能收入的，如《反对本本主义》（1930年）这篇重要著作，《自由是必然的认识和世界的改造》（1941年），60年代写的几篇哲学短文（《人的正确思想是从哪里来的？》以及有关学习马克思主义的认识论和辩证法的一组五段文字）。《毛泽东著作选读》新编本，注意选收了已收入《毛泽东选集》的那几篇哲学著作和充分体现哲学光辉的军事著作（如《论持久战》即全文选入），还收入了上述那几篇未能收入《毛泽东选集》的哲学著作。所以我建议，告诉现在想学哲学、要找毛泽东有关著作的同志们：《毛泽东著作选读》新编本提供给他们的，较为完备；它的注释除了修订得更准确外，还提供了新的东西，如《实践论》的一条新注，说明了毛泽东准备修改文中原来的一处不妥提法。
    我还建议，我们的出版、发行机构大量印行《毛泽东著作选读》新编本，使之成为广大干部的必读书和必备书。这样，也可以避免按不同方面或专题分别大量编印会造成印刷上的重复浪费。
    特借贵报一角，把这个建议转达给广大读者和出版、发行部门。
      敬礼！
