    The White Cloud Mountain Pharmaceutical Factory in Guangzhou is facing difficulties in self-digestion but has ensured stable and continuous production and development. In the first 10 months of this year, the factory's achievements are close to the total industrial output value of 540 million yuan and tax revenue of 60 million yuan for the entire year of 1988.

    The White Cloud Mountain Pharmaceutical Factory in Guangzhou is a diversified enterprise group with a focus on pharmaceuticals. This year, they have come up with new strategies to tackle the difficulties of self-digestion:

    First, they focus on market changes, seize opportunities to adjust product structures, and launch a series of new products. To this end, they have given new functions to more than 2,800 sales outlets across the country to capture market information. The decision-makers of the enterprise have become more informed: on the one hand, they further improve the quality of marketable products to ensure reputation; on the other hand, they strive to develop new products. This year alone, they have developed more than 10 new pharmaceutical products, as well as a batch of new products for solving the problem of car waxing in the north during winter, and for labor protection and traffic safety.

    Second, they aim at the international market and seize the opportunity to expand overseas, reducing the proportion of products competing in the domestic market. This year, they have established 5 joint ventures, reached agreements with foreign businesses to export large quantities of coffee pots, lamps, car stereos, and health food, and obtained approval from higher authorities to establish 3 overseas enterprises. They are also collaborating with foreign businesses to build the White Cloud Mountain Industrial Village. Currently, the factory exports more than 70 types of products, including nearly 50 types of pharmaceutical raw materials and products, which are popular in more than 20 countries and regions. In the first half of this year, they earned 3.62 million US dollars in foreign exchange, an increase of 33.65% compared to the same period last year.

    These two strategies not only helped the factory digest various difficulties encountered this year but also enhanced the enterprise's development potential. A pharmaceutical raw material production base with an annual output value of 100 million yuan and an export earning capacity of 5 million US dollars was completed and put into production in October this year, all funded by the factory itself. When the country faces difficulties, they take the initiative to make contributions. From January to October this year, the labor productivity per employee and the tax revenue per employee were both over 70,000 yuan and 8,000 yuan, respectively, both ranking first in the nation's pharmaceutical industry.

    白云山制药总厂自我消化困难
    开发产品拓宽市场
    头十个月实现产值利税接近去年全年水平
    本报讯　记者梁兆明报道：广州白云山制药总厂自我消化困难，确保生产持续稳定发展。今年头10个月取得的成绩接近去年全年工业总产值5.4亿元、利税6000万元的水平。
    广州白云山制药总厂是个以医药为主多种经营的企业集团。今年以来，他们自我消化困难再出新招：
    一是盯着市场变化特点，把握时机调整产品结构，接连推出一系列新产品。为此，他们对遍及全国各地的2800多个销售网点，赋予捕捉市场信息的新的机能。企业决策者的信息更加灵通了：一方面进一步提高适销对路产品的质量，确保声誉；一方面奋力开发新产品。今年以来，仅开发的医药新产品就达10多个，还推出解决北方在冬季打蜡难的汽车喷蜡，以及劳保、交通安全等方面的一批新产品。
    二是瞄准国际市场，不失时机地向海外开拓，以缩小在国内争市场的产品比重。今年，他们办起合资企业5个，与外商达成大批量出口咖啡壶、灯饰、汽车收放机和保健食品等协议，获上级批准开办境外企业3个，还与外商合作筹建白云山工业村。目前，出口产品已达70多种，其中医药原料和产品近50种，畅销20多个国家和地区。今年上半年创汇362万美元，比去年同期增长33.65％。
    这两招，不仅将今年以来遇到的各种困难基本自我消化，而且增强了企业的发展后劲。一个年产值1亿元、出口创汇能力500万美元的医药原料生产基地，他们硬是靠自筹资金，在今年10月间按期建成投产。国家有困难，他们争着做贡献。今年1至10月，全员劳动生产率和人均创利税，分别超过7万元和8000元，均居全国同行业之首。
