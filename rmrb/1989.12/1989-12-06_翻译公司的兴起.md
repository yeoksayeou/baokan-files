The rise of translation companies

With the development of international economic and cultural activities, translation work in various languages has become a vast industry. Although some countries have already seen the emergence of relatively large translation companies, the vast majority of translation products are completed by millions of individual translators.

According to a report by The New York Times on November 21, the total annual revenue from translation services worldwide is estimated to be between $10 billion and $25 billion. The combined revenue of the world's top 10 translation companies is only about $1 billion. Berlitz, an American company, has established 260 language schools in 25 countries to train translators and operates 12 translation centers. Another company, Apex, has 22 branches around the world. The largest translation organization in Europe is the Language Exchange Company in the United Kingdom.

The clients that translation companies aim to attract are financially robust multinational corporations. According to a survey, 40 multinational corporations collectively pay approximately $600 million in translation fees annually. To obtain the latest foreign business information, technological data, and relevant documents to promote their own business development, many large companies increasingly rely on translation companies to provide timely translations in their native languages.

Although computer translation machines are highly efficient, capable of translating one page of text per second on average, the variations in word combinations can produce vastly different meanings. Therefore, the translations are often inaccurate and require modifications or even retranslation by human translators, whose average speed is about 10 pages per day. Scientists are currently working to improve the software systems of computer translation machines.

    翻译公司的兴起
    随着国际经济和文化活动的发展，各种文字的翻译工作已成为一门庞大的行业。虽然有些国家已出现相当规模的翻译公司，但绝大多数翻译成品是由千千万万个翻译者完成的。
    据《纽约时报》11月21日报道，全世界每年的翻译劳务报酬总金额约在100亿至250亿美元之间，而全球最大的10家翻译公司的总营业收入仅约为1亿美元。美国的柏利兹公司在25个国家开办了260所语言学校培养翻译人才，并拥有12个翻译中心。另一家名叫阿普奈的翻译公司在世界各地有22个分公司。欧洲最大的翻译组织是英国的语言交流公司。
    翻译公司所要争取的客户是财力雄厚的跨国公司。据一份调查报告说，40家跨国公司每年共约支付翻译费6亿美元。为获得外国最新工商业信息、科技资料和有关文件以促进本身的业务发展，许多大公司已逐渐依靠翻译公司及时提供本国文字的译稿。
    虽然电脑翻译机的效率极高，平均每秒钟可译出1页文字，但文字组合的变化可产生千差万别的意义，因此译文极不准确，往往需要由翻译者修改，甚至重译，人工翻译的速度平均为每天10页。现在科学家正在设法改进电脑翻译机的软件系统。　（陈封）
