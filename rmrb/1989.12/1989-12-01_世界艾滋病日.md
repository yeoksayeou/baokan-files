World AIDS Day

December 1 is World AIDS Day, which was established by the World Health Organization in January 1988. The purpose of World AIDS Day is to raise public awareness of the dangers of AIDS. On this day, the World Health Organization and health agencies in various countries will carry out various activities to promote AIDS prevention and control education globally, aiming to curb the spread and proliferation of AIDS.

AIDS is known as the "plague of the 20th century," spreading at a rate of one new case per minute around the world. Since the first AIDS case was diagnosed in the United States in 1981, 152 countries have reported AIDS cases, with over 186,000 officially reported cases. According to the World Health Organization, the actual number of AIDS patients is estimated to be around 600,000, with approximately 6 million people carrying the AIDS virus. The United States has the highest number of AIDS patients, with 107,308 cases reported. Brazil, Uganda, and France follow.

AIDS poses a serious threat to human society. The virus is a lifelong infectious agent that destroys the human immune system, leading to various incurable diseases and ultimately death. To date, there has been no reported case of an AIDS patient surviving more than five years.

AIDS is a disease caused by lifestyle choices, with its primary transmission routes being homosexuality, multiple sexual partners, prostitution, intravenous drug use, and mother-to-child transmission (mothers carrying the AIDS virus infecting their newborns). To this day, there is no vaccine to prevent AIDS, nor are there any effective treatments or cures. Therefore, the only way to combat AIDS is through prevention. Prevention efforts primarily involve educating the public about AIDS, promoting good sexual morality, and maintaining a clean and healthy lifestyle.

### 世界艾滋病日

    世界艾滋病日
    12月1日是世界艾滋病日，这是世界卫生组织于1988年1月确定的。设立世界艾滋病日的目的是提高公众对艾滋病危害性的认识。在这一天，世界卫生组织和各国卫生机构都要开展各种形式的活动，在全球范围内进行防治艾滋病的宣传教育，以遏制艾滋病的传播和蔓延。
    艾滋病被称作“20世纪瘟疫”，以每分钟增加一名患者的速度在世界各地蔓延。自1981年美国诊断出首例艾滋病以来，世界上已有152个国家发现艾滋病，正式报告的艾滋病例已超过18.6万。据世界卫生组织估计，艾滋病患者实际人数已达60万，艾滋病毒携带者约有600万。美国是世界上患艾滋病人数最多的国家，目前已达107308例。其次是巴西、乌干达和法国。
    艾滋病对人类社会已构成严重威胁，其病毒是一种终身传染病毒，破坏人体免疫系统，导致各种不治之症，最终只有死亡。迄今世界上还无一例艾滋病患者存活5年以上。
    艾滋病是由于生活方式而引起的疾病，其传播的主要渠道是同性恋、多个性伴侣、卖淫、静脉注射毒品和母婴感染（携带艾滋病毒的母亲传染其所生的孩子）。至今世界上尚无预防艾滋病的疫苗，也没有治愈的药物和方法。因此，抵御艾滋病唯一的途径只能是预防。预防工作主要是做好关于艾滋病的宣传教育，树立良好性道德，保持洁身自好的生活行为。
