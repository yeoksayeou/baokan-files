In the eastern part of Hubei Province, in Huanggang County's Chen Cilou Village, the birthplace of Chen Tanqiu, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, the village party branch has recently been named an "Advanced Party Branch" by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The party branch secretary, Chen Yankui, has been honored as a national labor model.

In the early winter, reporters from Xinhua News Agency met Chen Yankui in Chen Cilou Village. This 43-year-old man had just returned from working in the fields. He was tall and robust, with a deep, resonant voice. His dark face bore the ruggedness of a farmer.

Chen Yankui spoke frankly, "No matter how many books there are, serving the people is the foundation. No matter how many tasks there are, party members must lead in everything." In 1922, Chen Tanqiu established the earliest rural grassroots party organization in Hubei Province in Chen Cilou Village—the Juxing Party Branch. During the war years, nearly a hundred people from Chen Cilou Village joined the revolution. The village was twice burned by the enemy, and 28 people sacrificed their lives for the revolution, contributing dozens of party leaders to the Chinese revolution. Chen Yankui said, "The revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their precious lives for the party and the country without hesitation. As a party member, I should now do my best to contribute to socialism. Chen Tanqiu vowed to save China at the age of 20. In our generation, can't we contribute more to socialism?"

Chen Yankui is the fourth party branch secretary of Chen Cilou Village since Chen Tanqiu. In his 17 years in office, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he has led the branch to tackle the root causes of poverty, making progress every year: dredging the harbor, building irrigation canals, constructing water gates and pump stations, building fish ponds, planting orchards, establishing a shipping fleet, and setting up a textile mill. The village's total industrial and agricultural output value this year reached over 9 million yuan, an increase of 106 times compared to 1980. The per capita net income of the villagers exceeds 1,000 yuan. Zhang Huancui, the head of the county's organization department, added that over the past 10 years, Chen Cilou Village has had no criminal cases, thefts, fights, unauthorized births, or superstitious activities, and is known as a "small special economic zone" for the construction of both material and spiritual civilization by the surrounding people.

"Whatever the masses need to do, cadres and party members should take the lead; whatever the masses do not need to do, party members and cadres should not do it first." This is how Chen Yankui demands of all the cadres and party members in the village.

When the village first implemented the household contract responsibility system, no one dared to take over the fish ponds of the various production teams. Chen Yankui took the lead in accepting the challenge. In the first year, he lost 500 yuan, but by the third year, he achieved a bumper harvest. After seeing the benefits, he immediately transferred the fish ponds to other villagers for contract management.

Under his leadership, the village's losses are borne by the party members, and the successes are shared with all the villagers. Party member Xiong Shunsheng's daughter, who had married out, was pregnant with her second child. Chen Yankui and Old Xiong discussed it, and Xiong Shunsheng immediately sent a message to his daughter to take contraceptive measures. The former deputy branch secretary, Chen Guojun, lost his wife suddenly due to illness. His wife's family, including an elderly person in their 60s and their children, knelt before him, begging for a coffin burial. Chen Guojun, with tears in his eyes, said, "I am a party member and cannot violate the rules of the party branch. Please help me." The cadres and masses present were all moved to tears.

Two years ago, the "Juxing" textile mill jointly operated by Chen Cilou Village and Wangjiadian Township incurred a loss of 507,000 yuan. The township handed over the mill to Chen Yankui, who got up at dawn and slept at midnight, traveling to Wuhan and Huangshi to raise 600,000 yuan. Last year, the mill achieved an output value of 2.5 million yuan and a net profit of 450,000 yuan. According to the contract, Chen Yankui could have received a full bonus of 150,000 yuan. However, he took not a single cent and turned over the entire bonus to the village collective. The township's welfare home has 31 elderly people. Chen Yankui personally contributed money to visit them. In recent years, while running business for the village, he spent all of his personal savings of over 3,000 yuan. His wife has always complained that Chen Yankui is "stupid" beyond measure.

    服务是根本
    ——访黄冈县陈策楼村党支书、全国劳模陈焱清
    新华社记者　方政军　通讯员　陈锦林
    鄂东黄冈县陈策楼村，是中国共产党的创始人陈潭秋的故乡。如今，这个村党支部新近被中共湖北省委命名为“先进党支部”，党支部书记陈焱清被评为全国劳模。
    初冬时节，记者在陈策楼村见到陈焱清时，这位43岁的汉子刚从田里劳动归来，他身材魁梧，声若洪钟，黝黑的脸膛上透出一股庄稼人特有的豪放气质。
    陈焱清快人快语，他说：“千本万本，为人民服务是根本，千头万头，党员要事事带头。”1922年，陈潭秋在陈策楼村成立了湖北省最早的农村基层党组织——聚星党支部。在战争年代中，陈策楼村有近百人参加革命，两次惨遭敌人的火烧，全村28人为革命献身，为中国革命输送了几十名党的领导干部。陈焱清说，“革命先烈为党为国家献出宝贵生命在所不惜。我作为一名党员，现在就更应该干出一番事业。陈潭秋二十立志救中国，到了我们这一代，难道就不能为社会主义多作点贡献？”
    从陈潭秋算起，陈焱清已是陈策楼村第4任党支书了。他上任17年，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，带领支部一班人从“穷根”上开刀，一年一个新进程：开大港、修水渠、建提水闸和泵站、修养鱼池、开果园、建船队、办布厂，集体经济红红火火。今年，全村工农业总产值达900多万元，比1980年增加了106倍，全村人均纯收入过千元。县委组织部长张焕卿补充说，10年来陈策楼村无刑事案件、无人盗窃、无人打架斗殴、无计划外生育、无迷信活动，被周围群众称为两个文明建设的“小特区”。
      “要群众干的事，干部和党员要带头干；不要群众干的事，首先我们党员和干部不要干”。陈焱清这样要求全村的干部、党员。
    村里刚承包时，各村民小组的鱼塘没有人敢接手，陈焱清带头揭榜，头一年赔本500元，第三年获得大丰收。村民们看到了甜头后，他立即把鱼塘转让给其他村民承包。
    在他的带领下，村里吃亏的事党员顶着，成功了让利给全体村民。党员熊顺生的出嫁女儿怀了第二胎。陈焱清和老熊一商量，熊顺生当即带信叫女儿采取节育措施；原任支部副书记陈国钧，爱人因病突然去世，爱人娘家60多岁的老人和儿女们跪在他面前求情要求棺葬。陈国钧含着泪说，我是党员，不能坏了党支部的规矩，请你们给我帮个忙。在场的干部群众都感动得流下了眼泪。
    两年前，陈策楼村和王家店乡合办的一家“聚星”纱厂亏本50.7万元，乡里把纱厂交给陈焱清，他五更起半夜睡，上武汉、下黄石，集资60万元。去年纱厂实现产值250万元，纯利45万元。按合同规定，陈焱清可得全奖15万元。但他分文不取把奖金全部上交给村集体。乡里福利院有31位孤寡老人，陈焱清私人掏了一笔钱，特地赶去看望。这几年为了村里跑业务，他竟然把私人的存款3000多元贴个精光。对此，他妻子一直埋怨陈焱清“傻”得出奇。
