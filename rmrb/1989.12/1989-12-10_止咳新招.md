Coughing repeatedly in a concert hall can greatly disturb an audience that is deeply engrossed in the music. Those who frequently attend concerts are well aware of this issue. Among the many audience members, there are always a few who have caught a cold and may not be able to suppress a cough.

Two years ago, a theater in Vienna took an interesting measure to eliminate this problem: during the winter season, the theater management provided each audience member with a free cough suppressant candy at the entrance. When a coughing fit occurs, placing the candy in the mouth can immediately stop the cough.

From early October to the end of May the following year, the theater needs to distribute 800 kilograms of these free medications.

    两年前，维也纳一家剧场管理处为消除这一不良现象，采取了一项有趣的措施：冬季期间，在剧场大厅的入口处免费发给每一位听众一种止咳甜药片，当咳嗽发作时放入口中，立即能够止咳。
    该剧场从10月初至第二年5月底需免费发放的药品达800公斤。　（秀丽）
