Genuine Friends

By Cheng Yuansheng, Xinhua News Agency

The sun was warm and the weather pleasant in Kuwait in December, making it one of the best times of the year. The visit of Chairman Yang Shangkun added a festive touch to this beautiful season. Emir Jaber of Kuwait personally welcomed Yang at the airport and accompanied him to the Peace Palace, where he would be staying. The warm and touching scenes of welcome fully demonstrated the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Kuwait. Today, all major newspapers in Kuwait prominently featured the news of Yang's visit on their front pages, noting that the friendship between Kuwait and China has a long history and that Yang's visit would further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.

Around noon, accompanied by the head of the Kuwaiti escort team and Minister of Oil Ali Harif Sabah, Chairman Yang enthusiastically visited the famous Kuwait Towers. When Yang climbed to the top of the tower, the escort team leader introduced that the Kuwait Towers stand at 187 meters tall, consisting of two spheres. The lower half of the larger sphere can store 1.33 million gallons of water, while the upper half houses a restaurant that can accommodate 200 people. The smaller sphere features a rotating observation deck where over 100 people can enjoy the scenery simultaneously. Originally, the Kuwaiti side had planned for Yang to only ascend to the upper half of the larger sphere. However, after reaching the restaurant in the larger sphere, Yang's enthusiasm was ignited, and he continued to climb to the rotating observation deck in the smaller sphere, gazing far and wide. The beautiful scenery of Kuwait was all before his eyes. Yang said, "The scenery here is truly beautiful. If one comes to Kuwait and does not visit the Kuwait Towers, it would be as if they had never been to Kuwait."

The Kuwait Towers are a symbol of modern Kuwait, representing the Kuwaiti people's economic development and conquest of nature.

Indeed, the Kuwaiti people have achieved remarkable success in developing their national economy. Twenty years ago, the 17,800 square kilometers of Kuwait's land were almost entirely barren desert, with no flowing rivers or tranquil lakes. However, beneath this vast desert lies an "ocean of oil." Kuwait's oil reserves amount to 14.5 billion tons, ranking third in the world after the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia, with an annual production of over 40 million tons and revenues reaching $9 billion. The enormous oil income has transformed this once-desolate and impoverished land into one of the richest countries in the world in less than 20 years, with a per capita income exceeding $10,000. Kuwait places great importance on utilizing its oil income to develop its national industries. Refineries, natural gas liquefaction plants, chemical plants, and seawater desalination plants have sprung up, rapidly propelling the country onto the path of modernization.

In his speech at the airport, Chairman Yang highly praised the great achievements Kuwait has made in developing its national industries.

Kuwait was one of the first Gulf countries to establish diplomatic relations with China. Since then, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have continued to develop, particularly in economic and trade cooperation, which has achieved significant success. In 1988, the bilateral trade volume between China and Kuwait exceeded $200 million. Chinese textiles, food, hardware, and light industrial products are popular among the Kuwaiti people. Over the past year, new Chinese electronic industry products such as washing machines, tape recorders, and electric irons have begun to enter the Kuwaiti market. China has also engaged in labor cooperation with Kuwait, with nearly 10,000 Chinese workers in Kuwait, primarily in the construction industry. Chinese companies such as "China Construction" and "China Harbor" have established offices in Kuwait.

Kuwait is the only Third World country that has provided loans to China. The Kuwaiti official institution, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, has provided China with a $300 million long-term low-interest loan to build 13 projects. Among them, the Xiamen International Airport, Tianjin Dafa Automobile Factory, and Beijing Silk Factory have been completed and are in operation, with good economic benefits.

Mr. Bader Humaydi, the General Manager of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, is very friendly towards China. In September of this year, he visited Beijing. He said, "In recent years, my multiple visits to China have left deep impressions. Since the implementation of reform and opening up, China has developed rapidly. Through my on-site observations, I am convinced that China is continuing its reform and opening up, the people's lives are normal, and the situation in Beijing is stable and safe." His words express the sentiments of many Kuwaiti business people. A Kuwaiti businessman said, "China and Kuwait have great potential for economic cooperation, where we can complement each other's strengths and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation."

Tonight, the Bayan Palace is brightly lit, and Emir Jaber of Kuwait is hosting a banquet to warmly welcome Chairman Yang. Yang's visit will surely elevate the friendship between the peoples of China and Kuwait to a new level. (Reported by Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, December 25th)

    真诚的朋友
    本报记者　成元生
    12月的科威特阳光和煦，气候宜人，是一年中最好的季节。杨尚昆主席的来访更为这美好的季节增添了喜庆的色彩。科威特埃米尔贾比尔亲自到机场迎接并陪同杨主席到下榻的和平宫，一幕幕盛情的欢迎场面亲切感人，充分体现了中科两国人民的深厚情谊。今天早晨科威特各大报都在头版显著地位刊登了杨主席访问的消息，指出科中友谊有着悠久的历史，杨主席的来访必将进一步加强两国的友好关系。
    时近正午，杨主席在科威特陪同团团长、石油大臣阿里·哈里发·萨巴赫的陪同下兴致勃勃地前往参观著名的科威特大塔。当杨主席登上大塔时，陪同团长介绍说，科威特大塔高187米，由大小两个球体组成，大球体下半部可储水133万加仑，上半部设有可容纳200人的餐厅。小球体上设有旋转眺望台，100多人可以同时观赏景色。科方原来安排杨主席只登到大球体上半部。杨主席登上大球体餐厅后，兴致正浓，又继续登上了小球体的旋转眺望台极目远眺，美丽的科威特景色尽收眼底。杨主席说，这里景色真漂亮，来到科威特不登科威特大塔就不算到过科威特。
    科威特大塔是现代科威特的标志，是科威特人民发展经济、征服自然的象征。
    的确，科威特人民在发展民族经济中取得了惊人的成就。20年前，科威特17800平方公里的土地几乎都是光秃秃的沙漠，既没有涓涓河流，也没有碧波荡漾的湖泊。但是就在这无垠的大漠下面却有一个“石油海”。科威特石油储量达145亿吨，仅次于苏联和沙特阿拉伯居世界第三位，年产量可达4000多万吨，收入达90亿美元。巨额的石油收入使这个昔日荒漠中的穷乡僻壤在不到20年的时间里一跃成为世界最富有的国家之一，人均收入达1万多美元。科威特十分重视利用石油收入发展自己的民族工业，一座座炼油厂、天然气液化厂，化工厂、海水淡化厂拔地而起，国家迅速地走上了现代化的道路。
    杨主席在机场的书面讲话中对科威特在发展民族工业中取得的巨大成就给予了高度的评价。
    科威特是最早同我国建交的海湾国家。建交以来，两国友好合作关系不断发展，特别是经贸合作关系取得很大成就。1988年中科两国双边贸易额突破两亿美元。我国的纺织品、食品、五金、轻工产品受到科威特人民的欢迎。去年以来我国的新兴电子工业产品洗衣机、收录机、电熨斗等开始进入科威特市场。我国还同科威特开展劳务合作，我国在科威特的劳工有将近一万人，主要从事建筑业，我国“中建”、“中港”等10大公司在科威特设立了办事处。
    科威特是第三世界国家中唯一向我提供贷款的国家。科威特官方机构阿拉伯经济发展基金会向我国提供了3亿美元的长期低息贷款，兴建13个项目。其中厦门国际机场、天津大发汽车厂、北京丝绸厂已经竣工投产，经济效益良好。
    阿拉伯经济发展基金会总经理巴德尔·胡迈迪先生对中国非常友好。今年9月份他曾到北京访问。他说，近几年来的多次访华都给他留下了深刻的印象。自实行改革开放以来，中国发展很快。我通过实地观察，确信中国在继续改革开放，人民生活正常，北京的局势是稳定和安全的。他的这番话表达了广大科威特工商界人士的心声。一位科威特工商界人士说，中国和科威特经济合作潜力很大，可以取长补短，互利合作。
    今晚，白杨宫灯火辉煌，科威特埃米尔举行宴会，热烈欢迎杨主席，杨主席的访问必将使中科两国人民的友谊提高到一个新的阶段。（本报科威特12月25日电）
