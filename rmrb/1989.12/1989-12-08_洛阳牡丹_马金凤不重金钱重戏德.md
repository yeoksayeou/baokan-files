At the end of November, the cold winds of winter swept through the northern part of Henan Province. In Bo'ai County, renowned Yu Opera performer Ma Jinfen was performing with her troupe in two dilapidated rooms. She laughed and said, "Living together with everyone makes me feel at ease!"

Ma Jinfen, known as the "Luoyang Peony," has refused high-paying offers from more than ten organizations in recent years. She does not perform solo or take on side gigs, and she continues to live and work in the relatively poor conditions of the Luoyang Yu Opera Troupe. Over the past five years, she has traveled to nearly a hundred villages, factories, and military bases in the western mountains of Henan, performing her signature pieces such as "Mu Guiying Takes Command," "Flower Drum at Dawn," and "The Story of the Flower Spear" a total of 1250 times. Sometimes, despite her age and frailty, she performs three shows in a day. No matter where she goes on tour, she never asks for special treatment. She does not stay in luxury accommodations, does not eat separately, and lives a collective life with the troupe members. Moreover, during her arduous performances in remote areas, she has also guided more than 30 young Yu Opera performers.

    “洛阳牡丹”马金凤不重金钱重戏德
    新华社郑州12月7日电  （通讯员宋秀杰）11月底，豫北农村寒气逼人，在博爱县演出的著名豫剧表演艺术家马金凤，仍然和普通演职员一起住在两间陈旧的房子的大通铺上。她笑着说：“和大家住在一起心里踏实！”
    素有“洛阳牡丹”之誉的马金凤，近几年先后拒绝十几个单位的高薪聘请，她不跑单帮、不走穴，一直生活、工作在条件较差的洛阳市豫剧团。她在近5年间先后辗转豫西山区近百个村庄和工厂、部队，演出《穆桂英挂帅》、《花打朝》、《花枪缘》等拿手戏1250场，有时不顾年老体弱，一天演出3场。无论在任何一个地方巡回演出，她从不要任何照顾，一不住高级房间，二不吃小灶，和剧团的演职员一起过着集体生活。而且她在艰苦的外地演出过程中，还为各地的30多名豫剧新苗进行了辅导。
