Currently, Lebanon is in a tense standoff between two major sectarian armed forces, with a crisis situation of swords drawn. On December 5, the Lebanese Christian forces loyal to General Aoun clashed with the Syrian-backed Muslim militias in Beirut, marking the most intense armed conflict in half a year. Meanwhile, Lebanese President Hrawi gave Aoun two weeks to withdraw from the Baabda Presidential Palace, otherwise he would take action. Aoun, who had been dismissed by President Hrawi, once again stated that he would rather die in battle than withdraw from the Baabda Presidential Palace, and insisted on not recognizing the legitimacy of Hrawi's new government.

The situation in Lebanon had previously shown signs of easing. Under the mediation of the Arab League's three-party committee, the conflicting parties in Lebanon achieved a ceasefire on September 23. Following this, Lebanese deputies convened in Taif, Saudi Arabia, to discuss and adopt the "Lebanese National Reconciliation Document." According to the document's provisions, the Lebanese Parliament formally approved the "Lebanese National Reconciliation Document" on November 5 and elected Muawad as the Lebanese President, thus ending the vacancy of the presidential seat for over a year. Unfortunately, Muawad was assassinated in a bombing just 17 days after taking office, plunging Lebanon back into crisis. The Lebanese Parliament, within 48 hours of Muawad's assassination, hastily convened in the Shatoura market in the Bekaa region under Syrian military control, electing Hrawi as the new Lebanese President. A few hours later, the Lebanese government led by Hus was announced.

The newly elected President Hrawi repeatedly stated that he would eliminate all obstacles on the path to reconciliation and would not allow two governments to coexist on Lebanese soil. If Aoun insists on holding onto power, he would resort to force. On November 28, Hrawi presided over a cabinet meeting and appointed General Lahoud as the commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces, thereby stripping Aoun of his legal status.

Aoun, commanding 20,000 Christian troops, refused to recognize Hrawi's legitimacy as President, refused to comply with Hrawi's order to withdraw from the presidential palace in East Beirut, and vowed to "die resisting the Syrian occupation." Previously, he had consistently opposed the Taif Conference and its document. He criticized the document for not specifying a timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and accused the Lebanese deputies of conducting the presidential election under Syrian "occupation," thereby harming Lebanon's independence and sovereignty. The hardline stances of the opposing sides in Lebanon once again plunged the country into crisis.

To break this stalemate, relevant parties are actively working. The Arab League's three-party committee issued a statement on November 30, calling on the opposing sides in Lebanon to exercise self-restraint and resolve issues through wise and sincere dialogue. Under the mediation of some countries, Lebanese President Hrawi announced on December 2 the postponement of the attack on the presidential palace. He stated that he would wait for the results of the mediation by relevant parties. He also said that once the "abnormal situation" in East Beirut is resolved, he and the Lebanese government would demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. French President Mitterrand recently called on Syria not to resolve the Lebanese crisis by force. However, it is reported that Syria has rejected France's new proposal for Syrian troops to withdraw from Lebanon in exchange for Aoun recognizing Syria's security interests. In recent days, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister and the Algerian Foreign Minister have successively visited Syria, Iraq, France, and the Vatican, which are related to the Lebanese crisis, to save the Taif Agreement and prevent the resolution of the Lebanese issue through war. People hope that the opposing sides in Lebanon will prioritize the greater good, avoid another armed conflict, and achieve national reconciliation and national unity through peaceful means.

    剑拔弩张的黎巴嫩局势
    本报记者　吕志星
    目前，黎巴嫩正处在两大教派武装力量紧张对峙、剑拔弩张的危机局势中。十二月五日，忠于奥恩将军的黎巴嫩基督教军队与叙利亚支持的穆斯林民兵在贝鲁特发生半年以来最激烈的武装冲突。与此同时，黎巴嫩总统赫拉维限期奥恩两周内撤出巴卜达总统府，否则他将采取行动。已被赫拉维总统解职的奥恩将军则再次表示，不惜战死，也不撤出巴卜达总统府，并坚持不承认赫拉维新政府的立场。
    黎巴嫩局势曾经出现过缓和势头。在阿盟三方委员会的调解下，黎巴嫩冲突各方九月二十三日实现了停火。接着，黎巴嫩议员在沙特阿拉伯的塔伊夫讨论并通过了“黎巴嫩全国和解文件”。依照文件规定的步骤，黎巴嫩议会十一月五日正式批准“黎巴嫩全国和解文件”，并选举穆瓦德为黎巴嫩总统，从而结束了一年多来总统席位空缺的状态。不料，穆瓦德总统上任只十七天，就在一次爆炸事件中遇难，黎巴嫩局势再度陷入危机。黎巴嫩议会在穆瓦德遇害四十八小时后，迅速在叙利亚军队控制的贝卡地区什陶拉市召开会议，选举赫拉维为黎巴嫩新总统，几小时后以胡斯为首的黎巴嫩政府宣告成立。
    新当选的赫拉维总统上任后一再表示，他将摧毁和解道路上的一切障碍，不允许在黎巴嫩领土上出现两个政府并存的局面。如果奥恩执意把持政权，他将诉诸武力。十一月二十八日赫拉维主持内阁会议，任命拉胡德将军为黎巴嫩武装部队总司令，从而使奥恩丧失了合法地位。
    统率二万名基督教军队的奥恩拒绝承认赫拉维作为总统的合法性，拒绝执行赫拉维要他撤出贝鲁特东区总统府的命令，并表示要“誓死反对叙利亚的占领”。在此之前，他一直反对塔伊夫会议及其文件。他批评文件条款中没有规定叙利亚军队撤
  出黎巴嫩的时间表，指责黎巴嫩议员在叙军“占领”下进行总统选举损害了黎巴嫩的独立和主权。黎巴嫩对立双方态度强硬，再一次使黎巴嫩局势陷于危机。
    为打破这种僵持局面，有关各方正在紧张活动。阿盟三方委员会十一月三十日发表声明，呼吁黎对立各方保持自我克制，用智慧和真诚的对话来解决问题。在一些国家的调解下，黎巴嫩总统赫拉维十二月二日宣布推迟攻打总统府。他表示将等待有关方面的调停结果。他还表示，当贝鲁特东区的“非正常状态”解决后，他和黎政府将要求叙利亚从黎巴嫩撤军。法国总统密特朗最近呼吁叙利亚不要用武力解决黎巴嫩危机。但据报道，叙利亚已拒绝了法国提出的关于叙利亚从黎撤军以换取奥恩承认叙利亚安全利益的新建议。近日来，沙特阿拉伯外交大臣和阿尔及利亚外长正先后访问与黎巴嫩危机有关的叙利亚、伊拉克、法国和梵蒂冈，以挽救塔伊夫协议，避免用战争解决黎巴嫩问题。人们希望，黎巴嫩对立双方应以大局为重，避免再次兵戎相见，通过和平途径实现民族和解与国家统一。
