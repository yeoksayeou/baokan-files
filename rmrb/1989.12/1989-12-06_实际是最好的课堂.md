Moral education has become a focal point of attention more than ever before. Since 1981, Beijing No. 55 Middle School has undergone nearly a decade of moral education practice and deeply understands that moral education must "start from reality." The school has summarized the practical aspects of middle school moral education into two fundamental areas: social reality (the national conditions and political and ideological factors, as well as their influence on middle school students) and the students' personal reality (psychological needs, actual moral conditions, and different levels of expression).

Party Courses and Systematic Standardized Education

In recent years, when criticizing Marxism has become a social trend, No. 55 Middle School has insisted on holding two sessions of part-time party schools and four sessions of party course summer camps. Considering the age, knowledge level, and other conditions of middle school students, it is unrealistic to require them to read the entire collection of Marxist and Leninist classics. Teachers chose a method of reading one original work, discussing one topic, conducting one lecture, and organizing one social survey. They read relevant chapters of "The Communist Manifesto," lectured on "The Footprints of Explorers," discussed "Why Communism is Inevitable in History," and observed the development and changes in rural areas in recent years. They read "The Direction of the Youth Movement," lectured on "The Origin and Development of Human Self-Awareness and Its Destiny," discussed "The Direction of Youth in the 1980s," and observed the growth paths of advanced model figures. They studied "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," lectured on "Thirty Years of Storms and Struggles," discussed "Why Modernization Construction Must Insist on the Leadership of the Party," and observed the great development of socialist construction since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. In guiding students to draw correct conclusions through presenting facts and reasoning, No. 55 Middle School has taken a gratifying step.

Another experience of No. 55 Middle School is to transform sporadic, random education into systematic standardized education. The school has always insisted on the institution of raising the national flag and the principal's speech every Monday morning assembly. It has also carried out the "Double Hundred" competition to implement the "Middle School Student Behavior Norms" based on classes. According to the characteristics of students of different ages, the school has stipulated the focus of teaching for each grade. At the same time, the school has formulated regular education systems such as initial grade field trips, second-grade one-day camp, first-year high school military training, second-year high school learning commerce, and learning industry. It has also opened lectures on legal knowledge for junior high school students and a series of lectures on "Democracy and Legal System" for senior high school students, etc. These educational activities and measures have strengthened students' organizational discipline, enhanced the spirit of collectivism, cultivated good habits, established the concept of loving labor, formed the atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving the school, and helped students initially cultivate civilized habits.

Stepping Out of the School to See the World

The school insists on taking students out every semester and during every winter and summer vacation to visit factories, go to the countryside, go to shops, and go to the military. These activities have a greater effect than classroom teaching. In 1985, students went to Yanqing countryside to conduct a social survey and were shocked to see 24 primary school students from five grades crammed into a dilapidated classroom. They said, "It was here that we realized the arduousness of the Four Modernizations and felt that we also bear the responsibility of history." In Huairou and Fangshan, students witnessed the transformation of former poor villages into new, civilized, and prosperous villages with rows of houses. They personally felt the correctness of the line and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Teachers have realized in their moral education practice that most students are patriotic, but they have seen some dark sides of society and heard some people's exaggeration and advocacy of the rapid development of capitalism, which has had a negative impact on their patriotism. Therefore, patriotic education should first help students overcome this negative psychology and arouse their patriotism, so as to produce patriotic behavior. The patriotic education for middle school students is mainly emotional education. Therefore, it is not enough to just talk about ancient civilization, the Four Great Inventions, long history, and glorious achievements to students. Exhibitions, rallies, speeches, lectures on history and the future are far from enough. Students must be allowed to contact society and reality, understand and identify with the real society, so that middle school students can change their negative emotions, produce a strong sense of social responsibility, and arouse patriotism. They took students to the countryside in Zhangjiakou and the countryside in the Luliang Mountains of Shanxi to conduct social surveys. In the countryside, they saw some families with only one quilt, and the students were deeply moved. They said, "We never thought there would be such a backward place. Looking at the high-rise buildings in Beijing, we thought the Four Modernizations were not difficult, but coming here we feel the importance of reform and feel that revitalizing China needs the hard work of several generations." Saying this, some of them took off their coats, and some of them drafted poverty alleviation plans overnight. Although these actions are still childish, their hearts have begun to burn. Stepping out of the school, students also stepped out of the misconceptions of their thoughts, and their understanding of the most basic national conditions made students re-recognize society and themselves.

    实际是最好的课堂
    本报记者　王娜梅
    思想品德教育，比以往任何时候更成为人们所注目的焦点。北京55中从1981年起经过近10年的德育实践，深刻地体会德育教育要“从实际出发”，并将中学德育面临的实际概括为社会实际（国情及政治的和意识形态多方面的因素及其对中学生的影响）和中学生的人生实际（心理需求、思想品德的实际状况和不同的表现层次）两个最基本的方面。
    党课与系统规范化教育
    在批评马克思主义几乎成为一种社会时髦的近几年，55中坚持举办了两期业余党校和四期党课夏令营。考虑到中学生的年龄、知识水平等各方面条件，要求他们通盘阅读马列经典著作，显然是不现实的，老师们选择了读一本原著、讨论一个专题、做一次辅导、搞一次社会调查的方法，读《共产党宣言》的有关章节，讲《探索者的足迹》，讨论“为什么说共产主义是历史的必然”，看农村近年来的发展变化；读《青年运动的方向》，讲《人类自我意识的由来和发展、归宿》，讨论“八十年代青年的方向”，看先进模范人物的成长道路；学习  《社会主义历史时期党的若干历史问题决议》，讲“风风雨雨三十年”，讨论“四化建设为什么必须坚持党的领导”，看十一届三中全会以来社会主义建设事业的伟大发展等。在通过摆事实、讲道理，引导学生自己得出正确结论的教育方面，55中迈出了可喜的一步。
    变零散的随机的教育为原则规范化教育，也是55中的经验之一。55中始终坚持周一全校集会升国旗、校长讲话制度。并开展了以班级为单位的贯彻《中学生行为规范》双百分竞赛活动，并针对不同年龄学生的特点，规定了各年级教学的侧重点。同时学校又制定了初一远足、初二一日营、高一军训、高二学商、学工的常规教育制度。开设了初中法纪常识讲座，高中“民主与法制”系列讲话等等。这些教育活动和措施，加强了学生的组织纪律性，强化了集体主义精神，培养了良好的作风，树立了爱劳动的观念，形成了尊师爱校的风气，使学生初步养成了文明习惯。
    走出校门看世界
    学校坚持每个学期、每个寒暑假都带学生走出去，到工厂、下农村、去商店、下部队，开展社会调查和社会服务活动。这种活动的作用胜于教室中的教学。1985年学生到延庆农村搞社会调查，亲眼看到一间简陋的教室里，竟坐着属于5个年级的24个小学生时引起震动，他们说：在这里我们才想到四化的艰辛，想到自己身上也肩负着历史的重任。在怀柔、房山，同学们目睹昔日的穷山沟变成了小楼林立、文明富裕的新山村时，亲身感受到党的十一届三中全会路线、方针的正确。
    教师们在德育工作实践中体会到广大学生是爱国的，只是由于他们看到了一些社会阴暗面，听到一些人对资本主义迅速发展的渲染和鼓吹，对他们的爱国心理产生了消极影响。因此爱国主义教育首先要帮助学生克服这种消极心理，激发他们的爱国热忱，才能使其产生爱国行为。对中学生的爱国主义教育主要是情感教育。所以对学生进行爱国主义教育只讲文明古国、四大发明、历史悠久，辉煌历程学生是不满足的，也不易激发他们的爱国热忱，办展览、集会讲演，讲历史、讲未来的教育远远不够，必须让学生接触社会、接触实际，通过对现实社会的理解和认同，使中学生转变消极情绪，产生强烈的社会责任感，激发爱国热忱。他们带学生到张家口地区农村，到山西吕梁山区的农村搞社会调查。在农村看到有的家只有一床棉被，同学们感触颇深，他们说：“真没想到还有这样落后的地方，在北京看着那些高楼大厦，以为四化建设并不困难，到这里看一看才感到改革的重要，感到振兴中华需要几代人的艰苦奋斗。”说着，他们有的脱下了自己的外衣，有的连夜草拟出扶贫方案，尽管这些举动还未脱离稚气，但他们的一颗颗心却开始变得火热。走出校门，使同学们也走出了思想观念的误区，对中国最基本国情的了解，使同学们重新认识了社会，认识了自己。
