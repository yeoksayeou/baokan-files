The Tianjin Youth Peking Opera Troupe, known for its well-rounded cast, complete range of roles, diverse repertoire, various schools of performance, and youthful vigor, began a series of performances in Beijing on November 24. Over 10 shows featuring nearly 20 classic plays were staged at Zhongnanhai's Huairen Hall, Beijing Workers' Club, and Jixiang Theater. Leaders such as Yao Yilin, Li Ronghuan, Song Renqiong, Liu Lantao, Wang Ping, and Huang Hua attended the performances.

This young troupe, with an average age of 26, has been under the care and support of Tianjin's leaders, especially former Mayor Li Ronghuan, since its establishment in 1984. Li not only secured funding for the troupe but also outlined a clear path for revitalizing Peking Opera: "First, inherit the tradition, then develop it further. Focus on nurturing young talent, support mid-career artists, and fully utilize the mentoring role of senior artists." Over the years, the troupe has invited renowned masters from across the country to teach and guide the young performers, enhancing their artistic creativity through intensive training. In just a few years, the troupe has cultivated a group of outstanding talents, transforming from an unknown "baby troupe" into a formidable force in the Peking Opera world with both domestic and international influence. Their performances in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Hong Kong have all been successful. Hong Kong newspapers have praised, "From this troupe, one can see the hope for national opera."

This time, their performance in Beijing was even more warmly received, with the audience frequently erupting in thunderous applause.

    小青年干出振兴京剧大事业
    天津青年京剧团来京演出成功
    本报讯　素以阵容整齐、行当齐全、剧目繁多、流派纷呈、演出中洋溢着青春气息而闻名的天津市青年京剧团，于11月24日起，先后在中南海怀仁堂、北京市工人俱乐部和吉祥戏院演出了10台近20出（折）精采的传统剧目。姚依林、李瑞环、宋任穷、刘澜涛、王平、黄华等同志观看了他们的演出。
    这个平均年龄26岁的年轻剧团，自1984年建团之日起便备受天津市各级领导，尤其是原市长李瑞环的关怀与爱护，他不仅想方设法为剧团提供了资金，而且为剧团明确提出了“先继承，后发展”，“抓青年、促中年，充分发挥老一辈艺术家传帮带作用”的振兴京剧之道。几年来，剧团从全国范围内延请各路名家来团课徒授艺，通过集中培训等办法，强化艺术创造能力。在短短几年当中，培养了一批能挑大梁的尖子人才，从不见经传的“娃娃团”一跃而为具有国内外影响的京剧劲旅。他们在北京、上海、沈阳及香港的演出，均获得成功。港报称道：“从这个团，看到了国剧之希望”。
    这次来京演出，较前两次更受欢迎，剧场中不时爆发出雷鸣般的喝采。      （陈绍武）
