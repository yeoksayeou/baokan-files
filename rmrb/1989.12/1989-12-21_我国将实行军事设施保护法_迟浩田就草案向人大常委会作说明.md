The State Council and the Central Military Commission submitted a proposal to the 11th session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee, held today, to review the draft of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Military Facilities.

The proposal states that in order to protect the safety of military facilities, ensure the effectiveness of military facilities and the normal conduct of military activities, the General Staff Department has drafted the Law on the Protection of Military Facilities. This draft has been discussed and approved by the State Council's Executive Meeting and the Central Military Commission's Executive Meeting.

At today's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Central Military Commission member and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Xie Haotian, explained the draft law. He said that since the founding of the nation, our socialist construction has been carried out under the threat of hostile forces abroad. China is a defensive country that actively defends itself. To safeguard national security interests and resist foreign aggression, the state has built military facilities on the front lines of coastal and border defenses as well as in the hinterland. After decades of development, a complete defensive system has been formed. These facilities have laid the material foundation for safeguarding national security interests, maintaining national territorial sovereignty and integrity, and have created the necessary conditions for the army to complete combat, war preparedness, training, duty, scientific research, and other tasks. However, due to various reasons, in recent years, military facilities have been deliberately damaged and occupied, affecting their effectiveness and endangering their safety and secrecy. This has seriously damaged the defensive effectiveness of military facilities and affected the completion of military preparedness tasks and the normal conduct of military activities. It is necessary to take effective measures to stop such behavior, improve the protection of military facilities, and enhance the defensive capabilities of the socialist state and strengthen military-civilian unity.

He said that due to the large number and wide distribution of military facilities in China, as well as the requirements for safety and secrecy, there are some conflicts between the protection of military facilities in some regions and economic construction and tourism development. On the one hand, due to the weak national defense awareness of some cadres and the masses, the emphasis is more on production and living needs, and less on the requirements for the safety and secrecy of military facilities, resulting in frequent incidents of occupying military facilities. It is difficult to stop such incidents with administrative, economic, and educational measures alone. On the other hand, in the new situation of national reform and opening up and economic development, the work of protecting military facilities must focus on key areas and continuously improve. These conflicts must be adjusted and resolved through legislation.

Regarding the guiding ideology of protecting military facilities, Xie Haotian said that the draft stipulates that "all levels of people's governments and military organs should protect military facilities and safeguard national defense interests from the perspective of national security's long-term interests. It is prohibited for any organization or individual to damage, occupy military facilities, endanger the safety and secrecy of military facilities, and hinder the effectiveness of military facilities." This is the core of this law. The reason for this provision is: first, the protection of military facilities is related to the long-term interests of national security. Only from this fundamental understanding can the importance of protecting military facilities be fully understood, and the relationship between this work and other work can be appropriately determined, thereby helping to change the past situation of insufficient attention to this work; second, the protection of military facilities involves a wide range, and the joint efforts of all levels of people's governments and military organs are needed to do a good job. It is helpful to clarify this in the guiding ideology to avoid possible disputes and evasions in the implementation of this law in the future due to unclear responsibilities; third, considering that the current phenomena of damaging, occupying military facilities, endangering their safety and secrecy, and hindering their effectiveness are quite common, there are both individual behaviors and organizational behaviors, and clearly prohibiting such behaviors is an important aspect of protecting military facilities, so it must be stipulated in this law as a general guiding ideology.

Regarding the delimitation and classification of military facilities, Xie Haotian said that in order to avoid defining the scope of military facilities too broadly and to ensure that the defined military facilities are effectively protected, and to minimize conflicts with economic construction and the production and living of the people, we have determined to implement the policy of "classified protection and ensuring key points" for the protection of military facilities. And according to the nature, function, safety and secrecy requirements, and effectiveness of military facilities, they are divided into three different types, and different measures are taken to protect them.

Xie Haotian said that the draft also made a general provision on how to properly handle the possible conflicts between the protection of existing military facilities and the implementation of national economic construction and social development plans.

    我国将实行军事设施保护法
    迟浩田就草案向人大常委会作说明
    新华社北京12月20日电　国务院、中央军事委员会向今天召开的七届全国人大常委会第11次会议提交了关于提请审议中华人民共和国军事设施保护法草案的议案。
    议案说，为了保护军事设施的安全，保障军事设施的使用效能和军事活动的正常进行，总参谋部草拟了军事设施保护法草案。这个草案已经国务院常务会议、中央军事委员会常务会议讨论通过。
    今天的人大常委会上，中央军委委员、人民解放军总参谋长迟浩田就这个法律草案作了说明。他说，建国以来，我们的社会主义建设是在国外敌对势力威胁下进行的，我国是积极防御的设防国家。为了捍卫国家安全利益，抵御外来侵略，国家在海防、边防前线及纵深地区修建了军事设施。经过几十年的经营，已形成一个完整的防御体系。这些设施，为保卫国家安全利益、维护国家领土主权和完整奠定了物质基础，也为部队完成作战、战备、训练、执勤、科研等任务创造了必要的条件。但是，由于种种原因，近年来，军事设施被人为毁坏、侵占，其使用效能受到妨碍并危及安全保密的现象越来越严重。已严重损害了军事设施的国防效能，影响到军队战备任务的完成和军事活动的正常进行。尽快采取有力措施制止这种行为，改进军事设施保护工作，对提高社会主义国家的防卫能力，加强军政、军民团结是非常必要的。
    他说，由于我国军事设施数量多，分布广，又有安全保密要求，使一些地区的军事设施保护与经济建设和开放旅游也存在一些矛盾。一方面，由于一些干部和群众国防观念淡薄，强调生产、生活的需要较多，顾及军事设施安全保密的要求不够，致使侵占军事设施的事件屡有发生，仅靠行政的、经济的和教育的手段难以制止。另一方面，在国家改革开放，经济建设日益发展的新形势下，军事设施保护工作必须突出重点，不断改进。这些矛盾必须通过立法加以调整解决。
    关于保护军事设施工作的指导思想，迟浩田说，草案规定的“各级人民政府和军事机关应当从国家安全的长远利益出发，共同保护军事设施，维护国防利益。禁止任何组织或者个人破坏、侵占军事设施，危害军事设施的安全保密，妨害军事设施的使用效益。”是本法的核心。所以这样规定，一是对军事设施的保护关系到国家安全的长远利益，必须从这一根本认识出发，才能充分理解保护军事设施工作的重要性，恰当地确定这一工作与其他各项工作的关系，从而有助于改变过去对这项工作重视不够的状况；二是保护军事设施工作涉及面相当广泛，需要各级人民政府和军事机关的共同努力才能搞好，在指导思想上明确这一点，有助于避免今后在实施本法过程中因职责不清而可能出现的扯皮、推诿现象；三是考虑到当前破坏、侵占军事设施，危害其安全保密和妨害其使用效能的现象比较普遍，其中既有个人的行为，也有组织的行为，而明确禁止此类行为是保护军事设施的一个重要方面，因此必须在本法中作为总的指导思想加以规定。
    关于军事设施的限定及保护类型的划分，迟浩田说，为了避免把军事设施范围划得过宽，又使划定的军事设施得到有效的保护，尽量减少与经济建设、人民群众生产生活的矛盾，我们确定对军事设施保护工作实行“分类保护，确保重点”的方针。并且根据军事设施的性质、作用、安全保密的需要和使用效能等要求，对其划分为三种不同的类型，分别采取不同的措施加以保护。
    迟浩田说，草案对如何妥善处理好现有军事设施的保护与执行国家经济建设和社会发展计划时可能出现的矛盾，也作了原则规定。
