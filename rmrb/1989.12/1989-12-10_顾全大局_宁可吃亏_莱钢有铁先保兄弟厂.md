Lai Steel Corporation in Laiwu, Shandong Province, has demonstrated a spirit of communism by ensuring the normal production of its sister plant, Qingdao Steel Corporation, despite facing extreme difficulties and economic losses.

Lai Steel, located in the central Shandong province's Yimeng Mountain area, is a crucial steel base for the province. Historically, Lai Steel has had an abundance of iron but a shortage of steel, while Qingdao Steel has had an abundance of steel but a shortage of iron. To ensure Qingdao Steel's normal production, Lai Steel annually supplies over 100,000 tons of pig iron to Qingdao Steel.

In recent years, Lai Steel's production and construction have developed rapidly. Previously, it could only produce a few tens of thousands of tons of special steel. Now, it can produce 500,000 tons of various ordinary steels. As the steel output increased, the supply of pig iron became severely insufficient. Lai Steel had to ensure the iron supply for its two 25-ton oxygen top-blown converters while also providing a large amount of pig iron to Qingdao Steel, making it difficult to balance both needs. Under these circumstances, Lai Steel prioritized the overall situation and, while striving to complete the production of 600,000 tons of iron and 500,000 tons of steel this year, made every effort to ensure the supply of pig iron to Qingdao Steel. It has already supplied 87,000 tons of self-produced pig iron to Qingdao Steel and purchased an additional 80,000 tons from the market to support Qingdao Steel, resulting in a loss of over 20 million yuan for Lai Steel.

    顾全大局　宁可吃亏
    莱钢有铁先保兄弟厂
    本报济南12月9日电　山东莱芜钢铁总厂在十分困难的条件下，发扬共产主义风格，宁可自己承受经济损失，也要保证兄弟钢厂——青岛钢厂的正常生产。
    莱钢位于鲁中沂蒙山区，是山东省的重要钢铁基地。这个钢厂与青岛钢厂紧密相关，由于历史的原因，莱钢有铁缺钢，青钢有钢无铁，为保证青钢的正常生产，莱钢每年要向青钢提供10多万吨生铁。
    近几年来，莱钢的生产、建设发展很快，过去只能单一生产几万吨特种钢，现在又能生产50万吨多种普通钢。钢的产量上去了，生铁生产供应严重不足，莱钢既要保证本厂两座25吨氧气顶吹转炉的用铁，又要向青钢提供大量生铁，两者难以兼顾。在这种情况下，他们顾全大局，今年在努力完成60万吨铁，50万吨钢的同时，千方百计保证青钢的生铁供应，已向青钢供应自产生铁8.7万吨，还从市场购进生铁8万吨支援青钢，一进一出，莱钢贴了2000余万元。
