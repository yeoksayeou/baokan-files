Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd.

The Soviet Union today announced the Supreme Soviet's decision on emergency measures for ecological protection. The decision stipulates that by 1995, the total area of nature reserves in the Soviet Union should reach 2% of the national territory, and by 2000, it should reach 3%.

The decision states that the ecological situation in the Soviet Union is worrying, with some areas on the brink of ecological crisis. Although measures have been taken in the past, the results have been minimal.

The decision sets clear targets for ecological protection in severely polluted areas such as the Aral Sea, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident-affected regions, and the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.

The decision emphasizes that from now on, new enterprises must undergo environmental impact assessments before they can start production. Environmental impact assessments for existing enterprises will be completed in the next two years, and environmental protection will be legally guaranteed. Economic measures will be used to reward units that protect the environment and punish those that damage it. Logging of cedars will be banned starting next year, and from January 1, 1991, logging will be prohibited in forest areas that have undergone resource surveys.

    苏联制订紧急措施保护生态
    据新华社莫斯科12月3日电　苏联今天公布了最高苏维埃关于生态保护紧急措施的决定。决定要求1995年前使苏联的自然保护区总面积达到全国领土的2％，2000年前将达到3％。
    决定说，苏联的生态状况令人担忧，有的地方的生态已濒临危机。尽管以前采取了措施，但收效甚微。
    决定对生态污染严重的咸海、切尔诺贝利核电站事故受害地区及塞米巴拉金斯克核试验场的生态保护提出了明确目标。
    决定强调，今后新建企业必须通过生态鉴定才能投产，明后年完成对现有企业的生态鉴定，并将从法律上保障生态保护，用经济手段奖励生态保护单位，惩治破坏生态的人与单位。从明年起禁伐雪松，1991年1月1日起对作过资源调查的林区禁止过量采伐。
