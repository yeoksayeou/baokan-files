    Wu'er Kaixi: The Man
    Fan Minyou
    _The Outlook_ Weekly Editor's Note: According to the Los Angeles _World Journal_, Wu'er Kaixi has become a "guest student" at the prestigious Harvard University in the United States. This "student" has set up a Wu'er Kaixi office near his residence, with a monthly rent of 1,100 yuan, and hired a full-time female secretary. He travels to various places to give speeches and attend meetings, staying in four-star hotels that cost between 80 and 250 yuan per day.

    Who exactly is Wu'er Kaixi? This article recounts his teachers and classmates' accounts of his studies and actions at the Central Institute for Nationalities Preparatory Department and Beijing Normal University. This will help people further understand the true face of this "turmoil elite," and also serve as a supplement to the resume of this "guest student" at Harvard University.

    Facing the Crisis of Being Expelled

    Li Lianjiang, Deputy Director of the Student Affairs Office at Beijing Normal University, said that before the turmoil, Wu'er Kaixi was on the brink of being expelled.

    He introduced that Wu'er Kaixi was a student of the preparatory department at Beijing Normal University, recruited in Urumqi, Xinjiang, in 1987. The state, considering that some minority areas have lower cultural levels than major cities, provided preferential conditions for minority students in college entrance examinations and admissions to cultivate minority cadres and develop cultural and educational undertakings in minority areas. Wu'er Kaixi's college entrance examination score was only 340, which was 120 points lower than the minimum admission score for Beijing Normal University. Therefore, he was first admitted to the preparatory department of the Central Institute for Nationalities for one year of study.

    Shen Changrong, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Preparatory Department at the Central Institute for Nationalities, said that most students here knew they did not meet the conditions to enter key universities for undergraduate studies, so they came to the preparatory department to make up for their deficiencies. After enrollment, they all studied hard. Wu'er Kaixi was an exception, often skipping classes.

    A classmate of Wu'er Kaixi at the Central Institute for Nationalities said that Wu'er Kaixi did not cherish the country's preferential treatment for him at all. He never studied seriously but often drank late into the night and slept until 10 a.m. the next morning. He occasionally went to class but often left halfway through. During exams, he copied others' answer sheets. But because he skipped so many classes, he didn't know some subjects at all, so even copying didn't work. For example, he didn't do well in mathematics and English, and his scores were failing.

    Deputy Director Yang Wu showed the student's scorebook to the reporter and said that Wu'er Kaixi's other subjects also only scored 60 or 70. In the mid-term and final exams, his mathematics score was 30, and his English score was 53, both failing. According to the school's regulations, Wu'er Kaixi should have been expelled from the preparatory department and sent back to Urumqi.

    In 1988, Wu'er Kaixi entered Beijing Normal University. A Uighur friend of his said that Wu'er Kaixi had told him that after entering Beijing Normal University, he only attended four classes in the first semester.

    Gao Changcheng, one of Wu'er Kaixi's teachers, said that Wu'er Kaixi's final scores for the first semester were: mathematics 47, English 57, biology 40. Looking back now, these scores were also inflated. He said that during the winter, he often saw Wu'er Kaixi wearing a cotton-padded jacket and basking in the sun at the dormitory entrance during morning class time. Until the turmoil began, many teachers still did not recognize him.

    Classmate Xiao Qiang said that Wu'er Kaixi did not study himself and looked down on those who studied seriously. He once openly said in the dormitory: "What's the use of studying? I don't study, but after graduation, I can find a better job than you through connections." Classmate Tan Ling said that Wu'er Kaixi, who hated studying, proclaimed himself as the "chairman of the Student Self-Governance Association" on April 21 and issued his first notice to incite a class boycott across the school. He urged everyone to post supportive slogans on their dormitory doors. The six students in our dormitory did not listen to him and insisted on attending classes as usual. Wu'er Kaixi, helpless, took money from the donations and tried to bribe us to post a supportive slogan. He flattered us, saying, "We are classmates and dorm mates, we should set an example." We returned the money to him and resolutely resisted his wrongdoings. Classmate Zhao Guohong said that once Wu'er Kaixi boasted to me, "I don't study hard, and now I am a student leader; you study hard, but you are still a 'loser.'" It really made me angry.

    Classmate Tan Ling said that Wu'er Kaixi was ignorant but liked to show off, often making himself look ridiculous in the dormitory. Once, we said that Yangzhou dialect is hard to understand. He said, "How can Yangzhou dialect be hard to understand? In my opinion, Shandong dialect is very easy to understand." It turned out that Wu'er Kaixi had moved the famous city of Yangzhou from Jiangsu Province to Shandong Province. Tan Ling said that to be honest, it was in our daily lives that the six of us saw that Wu'er Kaixi was not a good student, so during the student unrest and turmoil, we made up our minds: whatever Wu'er Kaixi did, we would resolutely resist. We insisted on attending classes and did not participate in parades, sit-ins, or hunger strikes.

    Teacher Gao Changcheng said that facing the crisis of failing three subjects and possibly being expelled, Wu'er Kaixi was anxious and restless. I asked him what he wanted to do, and he said one moment, "If I can't study, I'll drop out"; another moment, "Hold on, I can't go back like this"; and another moment, "I want to go abroad." When he and his accomplices stirred up the turmoil and it became more and more intense, he ascended to the "throne" of the "high-level student federation" leader, and he told his friends, "If this goes well, it will be good, even if I go back, it will be glorious, and I won't be said to have been expelled because of failing three subjects."

    A Busy "Peddler" and Petty Thief

    As a university student, Wu'er Kaixi rarely attended classes and did not study. How did he spend his days? Students who knew him and his former friends said that Wu'er Kaixi was busy! He had a strong desire for money. Because he had to socialize with illegal "peddlers" at night, drinking until late, he often slept late in the morning. He had to understand the situation in Xinjiang and find partners in Beijing. He was the intermediary between the "peddlers" in the two places, buying and selling furs and knives for profit.

    Classmates Tan Ling and Xiao Qiang said that Wu'er Kaixi did not consider his tax-evading business activities shameful but rather took pride in them. He often invited some "peddlers" to the dormitory, discussing business and drinking late into the night, making it impossible for the six of us to study in the dormitory at night. We had to go to the classroom or the opposite dormitory to "seek refuge." The students in the opposite dormitory would joke, "You've been driven out by Wu'er Kaixi and the peddlers again."

    Classmate Xiao Qiang said that Wu'er Kaixi had no regard for school rules and openly sold knives bought from Xinjiang in the philosophy department, trying to pass off inferior goods as good ones to cheat classmates out of money. He was exposed on the spot, and in his anger, he fought and even threatened classmates with a knife. Later, he heard that the school leadership knew about the incident and felt uneasy, so he tried to turn the tables and boasted in the dormitory, "If the leadership criticizes me for fighting, I'll say the philosophy department students insulted us."

    Classmates Tan Ling and others said that Wu'er Kaixi also had dishonorable behaviors of stealing bicycles and robbing peddlers' goods. They said that Wu'er Kaixi's bicycle was often changed, and they originally thought he was just swapping with his friends for fun. After Wu'er Kaixi fled abroad, five smashed bicycle locks were found under his bed. Teacher Gao Changcheng said that a bicycle theft case in Dongcheng District, Beijing, was solved by a police station, and the thief confessed that Wu'er Kaixi was his accomplice. Classmates who bought bicycles from Wu'er Kaixi also confirmed that Wu'er Kaixi's bicycles were very cheap, only 40 yuan for one.

    Wu'er Kaixi's classmates confirmed that he robbed peddlers in the campus. Passing by a fried egg stand, he would ask the peddler to fry an egg for him to eat; passing by a fruit stand, he would demand fruit; he even robbed peddlers' socks. If a peddler did not give in, he would threaten to take them to the school security office. Wu'er Kaixi would bring the robbed items to the dormitory and show them off, shamelessly saying, "These are the peddlers' tribute to me."

    Wu'er Kaixi's friend said that he started robbing peddlers even when he was in the preparatory department of the Central Institute for Nationalities. Once, a peddler came to the dormitory to sell things, and the classmates did not buy anything and told the peddler to leave. Wu'er Kaixi, however, called the peddler into the room, forcibly took the peddler's cigarettes and scarves, and only then let the peddler leave. At that time, we all disapproved, thinking he had brought shame to Uighur students. Because Wu'er Kaixi often bullied peddlers, before the turmoil, he was beaten by peddlers and "peddlers" outside the school, and his body was bruised and limped back to the dormitory.

    Xiao Qiang also said that Wu'er Kaixi shamelessly visited prostitutes and even boasted about it. Once, he returned to the dormitory, happily telling us, "I am the happiest person in the world. Last night, the pimp treated me, and I played with the prostitute for free."

    He was in debt for 7,000 yuan from his peddling activities and was anxious and restless. During the turmoil, when he received the first batch of donations, he embezzled the donations to pay off this debt.

    Teacher Gao Changcheng said that during the turmoil, a large amount of donations greatly satisfied Wu'er Kaixi's desire for money and pleasure. Classmates Xiao Qiang, Tan Ling, and others said that after Wu'er Kaixi had a large amount of donations in his hands, he bought imported suits and fashionable clothes, high-quality wool sweaters, beautiful shirts, and ties. He also hired a female secretary and bodyguards with the donations, surrounded by a crowd, and often went in and out of high-end hotels.

    Obsessed with the Power to Rule Others

    Many teachers and students at the Central Institute for Nationalities and Beijing Normal University said that although Wu'er Kaixi's professional knowledge, historical knowledge, and theoretical level were poor, his desire for power and to rule others was extremely strong.

    A Uighur student who entered the Central Institute for Nationalities with Wu'er Kaixi recalled that most of the minority students in the preparatory department were coming to the capital for the first time from remote areas and felt everything was strange. Wu'er Kaixi was a "returning visitor," spoke good Mandarin, and often took classmates out to the streets and parks. He openly expressed his desire to be the chairman of the preparatory department student union in front of many classmates, and we elected him. Unexpectedly, after he became the chairman of the student union, he became arrogant. He thought he was superior to others, never cleaned the dormitory, never fetched water, and always skipped his turn. He slept late in the morning and let classmates buy breakfast for him.

    Shen Changrong, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Preparatory Department at the Central Institute for Nationalities, said that Wu'er Kaixi had a set of methods to pursue power. As soon as he entered the school, he was active among the students and asked teachers who did student work to recommend him as the chairman of the student union. The preparatory department only lasted for one year, and if Wu'er Kaixi could do a good job in student work, it would be a good thing and a kind of training for him. But the fact was not the case. Once he had power, he became arrogant and did as he pleased.

    Teacher Shen Changrong said that the school regulations stated that students were not allowed to drink in the dormitory. However, Wu'er Kaixi, as the chairman of the student union, inspected the student dormitories and not only did not persuade classmates not to drink but also drank with everyone, breaking the school's regulation that drinking was prohibited in the dormitory. Wu'er Kaixi's behavior of violating school rules and not obeying school discipline aroused the dissatisfaction of teachers and most students. Coupled with the fact that he failed two subjects and had poor academic performance, his term as chairman of the student union was revoked before it ended.

    Deputy Director Yang Wu said that in mid-June 1988, the school announced that on June 24, the Central Institute for Nationalities would transfer students to Tsinghua University, Beijing Medical University, Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Beijing Normal University, and both sides would issue graduation certificates and admission notices to the students. However, on June 24, Wu'er Kaixi secretly led some classmates to buy train tickets and left the school without listening to the teachers' repeated advice. Wu'er Kaixi was like this, disregarding school discipline. Under these circumstances, I and the relevant teachers had to truthfully report Wu'er Kaixi's thoughts and behaviors to the Student Affairs Office of Beijing Normal University and suggested that such a student should not be a student cadre.

    Yan Bofei, Director of the Student Department of Beijing Normal University, introduced to the reporter the situation where Wu'er Kaixi, after entering the Education Department of Beijing Normal University, tried twice to become a department and school student union cadre but failed. He said that in March this year, the school student union was re-elected. According to the student union charter, the candidates for school student union cadres must be produced from the student representatives elected in each class. Wu'er Kaixi's class had 28 students, and only two classmates voted for him. He was not elected. So, Wu'er Kaixi was like an ant on a hot pan, actively seeking among the five elected student representatives to have them give him their student representative registration form. The elected student representative Liao Liang said that Wu'er Kaixi asked me, "Do you have the confidence to participate in the school student union election?" I said, "I don't have the confidence." Wu'er Kaixi immediately said, "I have the confidence to become a school student union cadre." He wanted me to give him the student representative registration form, so I gave it to him.

    Yan Bofei said that during the candidate qualification review process, it was found that Wu'er Kaixi was not a student representative elected by his class, and it was also found that he had failed three subjects. His candidate qualification was naturally canceled by the candidate qualification review committee. Because school student union cadres must be students who are excellent in both moral character and academic performance, while Wu'er Kaixi was poor in both moral character and academic performance and cheated in the election, Wu'er Kaixi argued with the department leaders and asked the teachers, "Why can't I be a student union cadre?" He also drank and got drunk in the dormitory, smashing more than 40 bottles, making the corridor full of glass shards. The students from the opposite dormitory came out to clean up, and he threatened them, saying, "Who dares to clean, I'll beat them up."

    A teacher added that Wu'er Kaixi was like this, ruling over his classmates, and sometimes showing off his knife in front of people. Students younger than him were afraid of him and dared not speak out.

    Yan Bofei said that it was this kind of person who shouted the slogan of "democracy" during the turmoil. In fact, Wu'er Kaixi did not understand what democracy was at all. He was good at being arbitrary. In front of Western journalists, he said, "Democracy is that the majority can act according to their own choices"; but on May 18, during the dialogue between the capital's students and Premier Li Peng, he said, "The students fasting in Tiananmen Square are not 0.1% obeying 99.9%, but 99.9% obeying 0.1%."

    Yan Bofei said that the things Wu'er Kaixi had been crazy about but had not obtained in his university life seemed to have been obtained in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion they stirred up. Wu'er Kaixi saw a group of Western journalists following and interviewing him, and he raised both arms, made a "V" shape with two fingers, and posed for the foreign journalists to take his picture. He also forgot himself and said to the student cadres, "Have you ever had such a scene?"

    吾尔开希其人
    范民友
    《瞭望》周刊编者按：据美国洛杉矶《世界日报》报道，吾尔开希成了美国有声望的哈佛大学的“客座学生”。这位“学生”“在住宅附近设立了一个吾尔开希办公室，每月租金1100元，并请了一名全职女秘书”，他“去各地演讲开会，每日住宿花费自80元至250元的四星旅馆都有”。
    吾尔开希究竟是怎样一个人？本文记述了他的教师和同学们介绍的他在中央民族学院预科部与北京师范大学的所学所作所为。这将有助于人们进一步认识这位“动乱精英”的真面目，对于哈佛大学这位“客座学生”的履历，也算作一点增补。
    面临被勒令退学的困境
    北京师范大学学生处副处长李连江说，在动乱前夕，吾尔开希正处在被勒令退学的危机之中。
    他介绍说，吾尔开希是 1987年北师大在新疆乌鲁木齐市招收的预科部学生。国家考虑到一些少数民族地区文化程度不如大城市，为了培养少数民族干部，发展少数民族地区文化教育事业，在高考招生录取时给予少数民族考生以优惠条件，适当加以照顾。吾尔开希高考成绩只有340分，比北师大录取最低分数线还低120分，因此先让他进入中央民族学院预科部学习一年。
    中央民族学院预科部党总支书记沈昌荣讲师说，这里的多数学生知道自己文化程度不具备进入重点大学本科学习的条件，来预科是补课的，入学以后都抓紧时间学习。唯有吾尔开希例外，经常旷课。
    吾尔开希在中央民族学院的一位同班同学说，吾尔开希一点也不珍惜国家对他的优待，从不认真学习，而是经常晚上喝酒到深夜，早上睡懒觉到10点才起床。他偶尔也到课堂听课，但也往往听半节课，下半节课就溜了。到了考试的时候，就抄人家的考卷。但因为他缺课太多，有的课一点也不会，照抄也会抄错，如数学和英语就没抄好，成绩不及格。
    杨武副主任拿出学生成绩册对笔者说，吾尔开希的其它课程，也只有60分、70分。期中、期末考试时，他的数学是30分，英语是53分，两门不及格。按学校的规定，吾尔开希应该从预科部退回乌鲁木齐。
    1988年，吾尔开希进入北京师范大学学习。他的一位维吾尔族朋友说，吾尔开希曾告诉他，进入北师大后的第一学期，他只上过四节课。
    吾尔开希的任课教师高长城说，吾尔开希第一学期期末的成绩是：数学47分，英语57分，生物40分。现在看来，这些分数的水分也很大。他说，冬季，我经常看到他在上午上课时间，披着棉袄在宿舍门口晒太阳。直到动乱开始以后，许多老师还不认识他。
    萧强同学说，吾尔开希自己不学习，也看不起我们认真学习的人。他曾公开在宿舍里说：“你们读书有什么用？我不读书，毕业以后，凭关系也能找到比你们更好的工作。”覃岭同学说，厌学的吾尔开希4月21日自封为校“学生自治会主席”以后发布的第一号通告，就是在全校煽动罢课。他号召大家把支持罢课的标语贴在宿舍门上。我们宿舍的6位同学不听他的，坚持照常上课。吾尔开希无奈，又从捐款中拿出钱塞给我们，想收买我们贴一张支持罢课的标语。他讨好我们说：“咱们是同班同学，又是同宿舍，应该做个榜样。”我们把钱退给了他，坚决抵制他的错误行动。赵国宏同学说，有一次吾尔开希耀武扬威地对我说：“我不用功读书，现在是学生领袖；你用功读书，却仍然是个‘瘪三’。”真是把我气坏了。
    覃岭同学说，吾尔开希知识贫乏，却爱自以为是，常在宿舍里表现自己，因此闹出许多笑话来。有一次，我们说，扬州话真难懂。他说，扬州话怎么难懂呢？依我看，这山东话很好懂嘛。原来吾尔开希把名城扬州从江苏省搬到山东省去了。覃岭说，说实在的，我们6个同学正是在日常生活中看清了吾尔开希不是个好学生，才在学潮和动乱中下定决心：凡是吾尔开希干的事，我们就坚决抵制。我们始终坚持上课，没有参加游行，没去静坐、绝食。
    高长城老师说，面对三门功课不及格，可能被勒令退学的危机，吾尔开希惶恐不安。我问他想怎么办，他一会儿说“学不下去就退学”；一会儿说“挺一下，不能这么回去”；一会儿又说“想出国”。当他与他的同伙挑起动乱、越闹越凶，他登上“高自联”头头的“宝座”以后，他对他的朋友说：“这次干好了，就好办了，就是回去也荣耀，免得说我是因为三门功课不及格而被勒令退学的了。”
    买空卖空、非法经商的“小倒爷”连偷带抢、嫖娼宿妓的小流氓
    身为大学生的吾尔开希，很少上课，又不学习，他是怎样打发日子的呢？知情的学生和他原来相熟的朋友们都说，吾尔开希忙着呢！他对金钱有强烈的欲望。因为他晚上要同非法经商的“小倒”们应酬，喝酒到深夜，所以早晨常常睡懒觉。他要了解新疆的行情，又要在北京找合伙人，他是两地“倒爷”的中间人物，倒买倒卖毛皮、刀子，从中渔利。
    覃岭、萧强等同学说，吾尔开希对他的逃税经营活动不以为耻，反以为荣，常把一些“倒爷”找到宿舍来，边谈生意，边喝酒到深夜，搞得我们六个同学晚上没法在宿舍自习，只好到教室或对面宿舍去“避难”。对面宿舍里的同学一看到我们去，就打趣说：“又被吾尔开希和小贩赶出来了。”
    萧强同学说，吾尔开希目无校规，公开在哲学系倒卖从新疆买来的刀子，把次品吹嘘成好货，企图骗同学的钱，当场被揭穿了，他恼羞成怒，大打出手，并亮出刀子威胁同学。后来他听说学校领导知道了此事，感到不妙，就想倒打一耙，在宿舍里扬言：“要是领导批评我打人，我就说哲学系同学污辱了我们。”
    覃岭等同学说，吾尔开希还有偷自行车和抢小贩东西的不轨行为。他们说，吾尔开希骑的自行车经常更换，原来还以为是他图新鲜，同他的朋友们换着骑呢。吾尔开希出逃国外后，在他的床底下发现了五把被砸烂的自行车锁。高长城老师说，北京市东城区一个派出所破获的一起自行车盗窃案，偷车者招供出吾尔开希是他的同伙。买过吾尔开希的自行车的同学也证实说，吾尔开希卖的自行车很便宜，只要40元钱就能买到一辆。
    吾尔开希的同学证实，他在校园内抢小贩的东西。走过煎饼摊，让小贩给他煎鸡蛋吃；路过水果摊，要人家的水果；甚至还抢小贩的袜子，哪个小贩如若不给，他就威胁说，要拉人家到学校保卫处。吾尔开希把抢到的东西拿到宿舍来，叫大家看，一点也不知羞耻地说：“这是小贩向我进的贡”。
    吾尔开希的朋友说，他抢小贩的东西，在中央民族学院预科部时就开始了。有一次，小贩到宿舍叫卖东西，同学们不买，让小贩走开。吾尔开希却把小贩叫进屋，强把人家的香烟、围巾等留下，才放人家走。当时我们都看不惯，认为他给维吾尔族同学丢了脸。因为吾尔开希经常欺压小贩，在动乱前夕，他在校外还挨过小贩和“倒爷”们的打，身上被打得青一块紫一块，歪歪倒倒地回到宿舍。
    萧强还说，吾尔开希还不知廉耻地嫖娼，而且当众加以宣扬。有一次他回宿舍，美滋滋地对我们说：“我是世界上最幸福的人，昨天晚上‘拉皮条’的请我客，免费让我玩了婊子。”
    他倒来倒去，拉下了七千元的债，惶惶不可终日。动乱期间，当他拿到第一批捐款，他就挪用捐款还了这笔债。
    高长城老师说，动乱期间，大批捐款极大地满足了吾尔开希对金钱和享乐的欲望。萧强、覃岭等同学说，自从吾尔开希手中有了大批大批的捐款，他就买了进口的西装和时装，高级羊毛衫，漂亮的衬衣和领带等。他还用捐款雇用了女秘书和保镖，前呼后拥，经常出入大饭店。
    狂热追求统治他人的权力
    中央民族学院和北京师范大学的许多师生说，吾尔开希尽管专业知识、历史知识和理论水平很差，但他的权力欲望和统治他人的欲望，却极其强烈。
    同吾尔开希一起进入中央民族学院的一位维吾尔族学生回忆说，我们预科部少数民族学生大多是第一次从边远地区来到首都，一切都感到陌生。吾尔开希是“旧地重游”，普通话也说得好，常带着同学们上街逛公园。他在许多同学面前公开表示，他想当预科部学生会主席，我们就选了他。没想到他当了学生会主席以后，就狂起来了。他自以为高人一等，从来不打扫宿舍，从来不打开水，一到他值日就溜了。早晨睡懒觉，让同学们给他买早饭。
    中央民族学院预科部党总支书记沈昌荣讲师说，吾尔开希对权力的追求有一套手法。一进校门，他又是在学生当中活动，又是恳求做学生工作的教师推荐他当学生会主席。预科只有一年，吾尔开希当学生会主席，如能把学生工作做好，当然是件好事，对他也是一种锻炼。但事实并非如此，权力一经到手，他就目空一切，为所欲为。
    沈昌荣老师说，学校规定，学生不许在宿舍里喝酒。而吾尔开希以学生会主席身份检查学生宿舍，不仅不劝说同学不要喝酒，还跟着大家一起喝，破坏学校关于宿舍禁止喝酒的规定。吾尔开希违反校规，不遵守学校纪律的行为，激起了老师和大多数同学的不满，加上他两门功课不及格，学习成绩低劣，因此，他的学生会主席职务任期未满，就被罢免了。
    杨武副主任说，1988年6月中旬，学校规定并向全体学生宣布，6月24日，中央民族学院分别向清华大学、北京医科大学、北京中医学院和北京师范大学交接学生，由双方分别发给学生结业证书和入学通知书。但是，就在6月24日这一天，吾尔开希私下领着一部分同学买了火车票，不听老师一再劝阻，离校了。吾尔开希就是这样目无学校纪律。在这种情况下，我同有关教师不能不把吾尔开希的思想、行为如实向北京师范大学学生处作了介绍，并建议这样的学生不能当学生干部。
    北师大学生部部长严驳非向笔者介绍了吾尔开希进入北京师范大学教育系以后，两次争当系和校学生会干部，最后都未当成的情况。他说，今年3月，校学生会改选。按学生会章程规定，校学生会干部候选人必须在各班选出的学生代表中产生。吾尔开希所在的班共有28名学生，只有两名同学投他的票。他落选了。于是，吾尔开希像热锅上的蚂蚁似的到五名当选的学生代表中活动，要人家把学生代表登记表让给他。当选的学生代表廖亮说，吾尔开希问我：“你有把握到校学生会参加选举吗？”我说：“没把握。”吾尔开希立刻说：“我有把握当上校学生会干部。”他要我把学生代表登记表让给他，我就给他了。
    严驳非说，在审查候选人资格过程中，发现吾尔开希不是本班学生选举的学生代表，还发现他有三门功课不及格，他的候选人资格理所当然地被候选人资格审查委员会取消了。因为校学生会干部必须是品学兼优的学生；而吾尔开希是品学兼劣，在选举中弄虚作假的坏学生。为此，吾尔开希找系领导大吵大闹，质问老师：“我为什么不能当学生会干部？”并在宿舍里酗酒，耍酒疯，把40多个酒瓶子摔碎，弄得楼道里有许多玻璃碴子。对门宿舍的学生出来打扫，他还气势汹汹地说：“谁敢扫，我就打谁。”
    一位老师补充说，吾尔开希就是这样在同学中称王称霸，还时不时在人们面前亮刀子。比他年纪小的学生都惧他三分，敢怒而不敢言。
    严驳非说，就是这样一个人，居然在动乱中高呼“民主”的口号。实际上吾尔开希根本不懂什么是民主，他倒是擅长独断专行。他在西方记者面前称“民主是大多数人能按自己的选择行动”；可是在5月18日首都学生与李鹏总理对话时，他又说：“天安门广场绝食的学生，不是0.1％服从99.9％，而是99.9％服从0.1％。”
    严驳非说，吾尔开希在他的大学生活中疯狂追求而没能得到的东西，在他们挑起的动乱和反革命暴乱中似乎得到了。吾尔开希看到身后有一群西方记者追踪采访，他高举双臂，伸出两个手指头做“V”形，作出一个姿势，让外国记者为他照像。他还得意忘形地对学生干部们说：“你们有过这样的场面吗？”
