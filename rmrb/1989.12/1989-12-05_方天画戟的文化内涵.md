The halberd, by the Tang Dynasty, had become a ceremonial weapon, but it did not completely disappear from the battlefield. Tang general Xue RenGui was a renowned warrior who wielded the halberd. The art of halberd fighting, as a martial arts weapon dance routine, has been rarely seen for many years. In recent years, while excavating traditional routines, a set of NanYang halberd techniques was rediscovered. The halberd manual repeatedly emphasizes the halberd's resemblance to a dragon, stating: "This halberd is like a dragon, fangs bared and claws dancing as it moves forward. The halberd technique is like a dragon's claw, always returning to the chest. The green dragon lowers its head to support the halberd stance, gripping the opponent without letting go..." Dragon halberds, snake spears, tiger swords, and crane swords... the anthropomorphic techniques on weapons reflect the most universal and important characteristic of Eastern body culture: anthropomorphism.

Whether in traditional martial arts, folk dances, or theatrical performances, anthropomorphism is ubiquitous. "Anthropomorphism" refers to using human movements to mimic the shapes of objective things, most commonly birds, beasts, flowers, trees, fish, and insects, as well as natural phenomena like clouds, thunder, lakes, seas, mountains, rivers, gold, and stones. Even imaginary gods, spirits, or specific human forms and situations, such as drunkenness in drunkard's fist or drunkard's sword, are included. Sichuan's cripple's fist mimics the martial arts stance of a disabled person, and the traditional opera "The Battle of the Melon Garden" features Tao Hong's performance in this style.

"Taking meaning" refers to the significance contained within anthropomorphic movements. Martial arts and dances that mimic dragons take on the spiritual meaning of ascension and transformation. The famous mantis boxing, for instance, takes its techniques from the brave insect's dual-sword fighting stance. In world body culture, anthropomorphism is common, but those that both anthropomorphize and take meaning are rare. However, Chinese dance, martial arts, and theatrical traditions all have a long history and rich heritage of anthropomorphism and meaning-taking. This is one of the reasons why Eastern body culture can stand out and form its own system. Some say that without anthropomorphism and meaning-taking, there would be no Chinese martial arts. This statement is not an exaggeration. Qi Gong, which focuses on cultivating qi for health, is the same. The "Bear's Essence, Bird's Stretch" from the pre-Qin era, and Hua Tuo's creation of the Five Animal Frolics in the Eastern Han Dynasty, need not be mentioned. Even some modern Qi Gong practices, such as the "Crane Stance" and "Wild Goose Stance," and the recently popular health and weight loss Qi Gong therapy from Tsinghua University, "Jade Toad Absorbs Essence" and "Jade Toad Rides the Waves," all take their inspiration from the image of the hibernating toad.

In the body culture of ethnic minorities, the cultural deposits of anthropomorphism and meaning-taking are even deeper. The Dai people's peacock dance and peacock boxing; the Zhuang people's series of ant dances and ant martial arts series—ant boxing, ant sword, ant staff, etc., have formed an ancient and deeply influential unique cultural phenomenon.

In martial arts, snake boxing, tiger boxing, and golden lion boxing are all anthropomorphic boxing styles, with anthropomorphism and meaning-taking being self-evident. Even in boxing styles that are not entirely created based on anthropomorphic objects, there are many anthropomorphic movements. For example, in "Eight Trigrams Palm," there are movements like "Green Dragon Returns Its Head," "Swallow Dives to the Sky," "White Snake Lies in the Grass," "Swallow Skims the Water," "Phoenix Spreads Its Wings," and "Tiger Pounces on Prey." The "Wild Horse Parting Its Mane" and "White Crane Spreads Its Wings" in Tai Chi are also well-known examples.

Many contemporary dance creations also often use the method of anthropomorphism and meaning-taking, such as Jia Zuoguang's famous "Wild Geese Dance" and "Sea Waves."

The theatrical performance routines summarized in opera, such as the forms of dragon, tiger, leopard, elephant, bear, ox, wolf, goose, and chicken, and the Five Poisons Opera, are all combined with the character's role and personality traits, using the forms of animals to seek the spirit, becoming an important feature of Chinese opera performance art.

The formation of anthropomorphism and meaning-taking has ancient origins, being both a remnant of totem worship and the bud of biomimicry. Totem worship is a cultural period that all nations have experienced. Why did China alone form such a rich anthropomorphic and meaning-taking body culture? This is related to the Eastern classical philosophy of the unity of heaven and man, the aesthetics of learning from nature and creation, and more importantly, the influence of a unique animal culture view.

    方天画戟的文化内涵
    峻骧
    戟在唐代已成为门戟队仪，但并不是完全从战场上消失，唐将薛仁贵就是使戟的名将。戟术作为武术器械舞练的套路，却多年少见，近几年发掘传统套路时，又发掘出了一套南阳戟术，戟谱中反复提示戟取龙形之意，谱曰：“此戟本是一条龙，张牙舞爪向前行，戟法好比龙探爪，回去总是奔前胸，青龙低头托戟势，叼住对手不放松……”龙戟、蛇矛、虎刀、鹤剑……兵器上的象形招式，正反映了东方人体文化本体特征中最普遍、最重要的本体特性：象形取意性。
    不管是传统武术、民间舞蹈，还是戏曲表演，都普遍存在着象形取意性。“象形”就是以人体动作，摹拟客观事物的形象，最多的是飞禽走兽、花木鱼虫，也有云雷湖海、山河金石等自然物象，甚至客观现实中并不存在的想象中的神佛灵物，抑或是人的特定形态处境，如醉拳、醉剑是像醉酒之态。四川的跛子拳，则是像残疾人之武态，京剧传统剧目《打瓜园》中陶洪的表演亦是此类。
    “取意”则是指象形动作中含蕴的意义，象龙形的武术和舞蹈是取其升腾变化的精神意义，有名的螳螂拳法，则是取勇敢的昆虫螳螂双刀交选进击的攻防技术之招法。世界人体文化中，象形者甚多，而既能象形而又取意者则甚微。而中国的舞蹈、武术和戏曲传统技巧中却都有象形取意的悠久传统和丰富遗珍。这也是东方人体文化能卓然而立、自成体系的原因之一。有人说没有象形取意，就没有中国武术，这说法并非夸张；以练气养生为主的气功，同样如此，先秦时代的“熊经鸟伸”、东汉华陀创造的五禽戏，自不待言，就是现代人创造的一些功法，如“鹤翔桩”、“大雁桩”和刚刚兴起的清华大学推广的健美减肥气功疗法的主要功法“玉蟾吸真功”和“玉蟾翻浪功”也都是对有冬眠功能的青蛙的形象取意。
    少数民族的人体文化中，体现象形取意的文化积淀更为深厚，傣族的孔雀舞、孔雀拳术；壮族蚂?舞蹈系列和蚂?武术系列——蚂?拳、蚂?刀、蚂?棍等等，更形成了一个渊源古老、影响至深的独特文化现象。
    武术中的蛇拳、虎拳、金狮拳等象形拳法，象形取意自不待言。一些并没有完全以象形物编创的拳术中，亦有许多象形动作，如“八卦掌”中有“青龙返首”、“鹞子钻天”、“白蛇伏草”、“燕子抄水”、“凤凰展翅”、“猛虎扑食”等象形动作；太极拳的“野马分鬃”、“白鹤亮翅”更是大家熟悉的。
    当代许多舞蹈创作，也常用象形取意之法，如贾作光脍炙人口的“雁舞”、“海浪”等。
    戏曲套型表演所总结的龙、虎、豹、象、熊、牛、狼、鹅、鸡形和五毒戏，都是结合人物行当、性格特色，以动物之形，取意求神而成，成为中国戏曲表演艺术的重要特色。
    象形取意的形成，渊源古老，既是图腾崇拜的遗存，又是仿生学的萌芽。图腾崇拜是世界各民族都经历过的原始文化时期，为什么单单在中国形成了如此丰富的象形取意之人体文化呢？这既与东方古典哲学中的天人合一、美学的师法自然、师法造化有关，更主要的是独特的动物文化观的影响。
