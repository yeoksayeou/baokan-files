    Hainan Province places great importance on its telecommunications industry, considering it a crucial aspect of improving the investment environment. The province has initially established a telecommunications network with microwave as the backbone, landlines as the primary circuits, and shortwave wireless as backup circuits. Over the past few years, Hainan has significantly alleviated the long-standing issue of difficulty in making long-distance calls. Haikou and Sanya have now opened direct-dial long-distance services to all major cities in the country, except Taiwan. Currently, 17 out of the province's 19 cities and counties have installed programmable and other automatic telephones. According to statistics, the total number of automatic telephones in the province's towns has reached over 33,000.
