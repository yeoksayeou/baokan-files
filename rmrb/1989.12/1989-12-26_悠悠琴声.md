I remember, it was during the tumultuous decade of the Cultural Revolution, after a particularly severe storm in the evening, I returned to the village of Ba'er Zhuang in the Lvliang Mountains where I was stationed. The desolate wind and bitter rain pounded against our dilapidated "sent-down youth" shack, leaving us, the outsiders, feeling desolate and bewildered. At that time, how could we pass the time? Suddenly, one day, a deep and resonant piano melody from our neighbor's house abruptly began, awakening and stirring our hearts. The piano keys, amidst the thunder and lightning, lifted the curtain of challenge, and the struggle and cries of fate echoed through the vast and desolate sky. All this was the doing of the exiled pianist and his sole possession, the "Star Sea" piano.

Beijing. Huangmuqiao. No. 6. Several years later, I had the fortune to visit the cradle of the "Star Sea."

"We are one of the oldest factories," said the factory director, Zhai Kangle, a graduate of the Beijing Institute of Civil Engineering, who was passionate about dedicating himself to the cultural enterprise. Beijing Piano Factory is one of the earliest manufacturers of pianos in the country, with products sold in more than 60 countries and regions around the world. To weave this golden cradle, many ordinary and extraordinary people have poured in countless wisdom and heartblood.

The cradle of the cradle is the final assembly workshop. An elderly piano maker with wrinkles etched on his face squatted, skillfully using various testing tools: "'Star Sea' is like my child. As parents, we should be especially concerned, right?" Another young piano maker with beads of sweat on his forehead was meticulously tuning the piano with an electronic device that emits audio flashes, "Accurate pitch and stable tone are the soul of 'Star Sea.' There can be no negligence or carelessness." This voice, flowing from the heart, is so beautiful and moving.

In the midst of the intense labor competition atmosphere, I also met a group of "product quality excellence experts." These key figures, distributed in the main workshops such as stringing, hammering, painting, and assembly, are diligent, hardworking, and have a strong sense of competition. They pay meticulous attention to even the smallest details, striving for perfection. They have contributed arduous labor and made great sacrifices for the rise of "Star Sea." When the Chinese pianist Zhou Guangren successfully performed Chopin and Mozart's works with "Star Sea" and received thunderous applause, she would certainly think of the pioneers in this "Star Sea" cradle.

When Professor Joseph Banovitz of the University of Texas at Austin traveled thousands of miles to visit the factory, he gave a thumbs up and said that "Star Sea" was indeed famous, and he was willing to hold a personal performance with "Star Sea." Overseas compatriots were even more emotional: "When 'McCarthyism' was rampant, after much difficulty, we finally bought a 'Star Sea.' In the long years, it brought us emotions and words that cannot be expressed..."

I also met the "foreign director," who was hired to help design new models. The "foreign director" was moved by the spirit of the pioneers and was determined to enter the world market with his Chinese counterparts.

On this day, it was the factory's sales day, and customers who specifically requested "Star Sea" came in a steady stream. The sales department was bustling with activity, struggling to keep up with the demand. Watching this scene, I recalled the early 1980s, when a farmer buying a "Star Sea" became a sensation. In the blink of an eye, today, the piano is no longer a "salon toy." When the customers who bought the piano left like a tide, what remained in the cradle was the ceaseless melody of a new life.

A green breeze blew, as if carrying the majestic and stirring melody of the "Yellow River Cantata." Oh, the piano named after the composer of this immortal work, how could it not often give people the faith of the Yellow River, the grandeur of the Yellow River, the pursuit of the Yellow River, and the pioneering spirit of the Yellow River!

    悠悠琴声
    王晋军
    记得，那是10年动乱中一个特大暴风雨后的黄昏，我插队所在的吕梁山区豹儿庄，收工回村，凄风苦雨敲打着破败的“知青棚”，我们几个外来户，面对孤寂的山庄一片怅惘、一片茫然。其时，如何打发这难熬的时光？突然，有一天就在我们的近邻一曲浑厚、沉重的叩击声骤然响起，惊醒和震撼着我们的心灵。琴键在雷与电的撞击中掀开挑战的帷幕，命运的抗争与呐喊滚荡在寥廓苍茫的天地之间。这一切，均系被放逐来“脱胎换骨”的钢琴家及他唯一的家当“星海”钢琴所为。
    北京。黄木场。6号。十几年之后，我有幸踏访“星海”的摇篮。
      “我们厂算得上老字号了，历史可追溯到延安‘鲁艺’乐器修理室。1949年6月1日建厂时，取名人民艺术服务社。”厂长翟康乐毕业于建筑工程学院，却热衷献身于文化企业。北京钢琴厂是全国最早生产钢琴的厂家，产品畅销世界60多个国家和地区。为编织这个金色摇篮，许多平凡的、不平凡的人们，倾注了大量的智慧和心血。
    摇篮的摇篮是总装车间。一位脸上结满皱纹的老琴师蹲伏着，稔熟地换用着各种检测工具：“‘星海’，就好像是我的孩子，做‘父母’的应该格外操心才对呀！”另一位充满稚气的小琴师额头上挂满汗珠，正用音频闪光的电子仪为钢琴精心调音，“音律准确，音准稳定是‘星海’的灵魂，来不得丝毫疏忽和大意”。这从心田流出的声音，是那样的美妙动听。
    在火热地劳动竞赛氛围中，我还认识了一批“产品质量创优能手”。这些分布在张弦、击弦机、油漆、装配等主要车间的骨干们，勤奋好学，任劳任怨，具有强烈的“争雄”意识，对哪怕是任何些微的事情都做到了一丝不苟，精益求精。他们为“星海”的崛起付出了艰巨劳动，捐奉了巨大代价。当中国钢琴家周广仁用“星海”成功地演奏肖邦、莫扎特的作品赢得暴风骤雨般掌声时，她当然会想到这“星海”摇篮里的创业者。
    当美国得克萨斯州音乐学院教授约瑟夫·巴诺维兹不远万里，慕名来厂参观时，他竖起了拇指，称“星海”名非虚传，欣然同意用“星海”举办个人作品演奏会。那些侨居海外的同胞情更浓：“当‘麦卡锡主义’还猖獗之时，几经辗转买到一架‘星海’，在漫长岁月里，它带给我们的难以用感情和语言来表达……”
    我还见到了这里的“洋厂长”，他是被聘请来帮助设计新型号的。“洋厂长”为创业者的精神所感动，有决心和中国同行一起进军世界市场。
    这天是厂销日，指名来要“星海”的用户络绎不绝，销售科门庭若市，应接不暇。望着这情景，我忆起80年代之初，一位农民买“星海”成为轰动一时的新闻。弹指一挥，如今，钢琴不再是“沙龙玩偶”。当买上钢琴的顾客像潮水般退去的时候，留在摇篮里的，是奔腾不息的新生活的鸣奏。
    一阵绿风拂过，仿佛传来《黄河大合唱》磅礴激越的旋律。哦，以这不朽之作的曲作者命名的钢琴，怎能不时常给人以黄河的信念，黄河的气魄，黄河的追求，黄河的开拓！
