Currently, Shanghai receives 800,000 letters from Taiwan every month. This information was disclosed by a Shanghai Postal Administration official during a recent report to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

It is understood that the speed of mail exchange between Shanghai and Taiwan has significantly increased. Now, letters sent from Taipei to Shanghai can be delivered to the recipient within 5 to 7 days if the parcel is successfully dispatched. From April 1988 to April 1989, tens of thousands of letters sent from Taiwan via the Red Cross, which had incomplete addresses and were difficult to deliver, were successfully tracked down and delivered by Shanghai postal workers, achieving a delivery rate of 99.9%.

CPPCC members hope that Shanghai telecommunications workers and their counterparts in Taiwan will further strengthen business ties. They also call on the Taiwanese authorities to remove artificial obstacles and implement full, two-way postal services across the Taiwan Strait.

    上海每月收台湾邮件八十万
    政协委员呼吁实现两岸双向全面通邮
    新华社上海12月26日电　目前，上海每月收到从台湾寄来的邮件已达80万件。这是上海邮电管理局负责人日前向上海市政协视察团汇报工作时透露的。
    据了解，沪台间邮件往返的速度已大大加快。如今，台北发来上海的平信在封包挂发顺利的情况下，5至7天可送达上海收信人手里。从1988年4月至1989年4月，由台湾红十字会转送的数万件地名不详、难以投递的邮件，经上海邮电职工千方百计查寻，妥投率已达99.9％。
    政协委员们希望上海电信职工和台湾的同行进一步加强业务联系，同时呼吁台湾当局进一步消除人为障碍，实行海峡两岸双向、全面的通邮。
