No one has ever seen a blue rose, but in two years, they will appear in the flower market. A plant scientist from a biotechnology research institute in Melbourne, Australia, has successfully cultivated several varieties of blue flowers using the most advanced genetic engineering techniques, including roses. The director of this research institute, Dr. Michael Darling, said that the first batch of seedlings has already grown this year, but it will take two more years before they can be mass-produced. It is estimated that at that time, the price of each blue rose in the market will reach 50 pounds. The global annual flower trade is worth 10 billion pounds. With rarity comes value, and in two years, despite the high price of blue roses, people will still rush to buy them.

    蓝色玫瑰花
    任何人都没有见过蓝色的玫瑰花，但两年后就可以在鲜花市场上出现了。澳大利亚墨尔本市1个生物技术研究机构的植物学家运用最先进的遗传工程手段已初步培育出若干种蓝色花卉，其中包括玫瑰。这个研究机构的负责人迈可·达林博士说第一批幼苗今年已生长出来，但要到两年后才能够成批培植。估计，那时市场上每朵蓝玫瑰的售价可达50英镑。全世界每年的鲜花交易金额为100亿英镑。物以稀为贵，两年后，尽管蓝色玫瑰花价格昂贵，但人们将依然会争着购买。
