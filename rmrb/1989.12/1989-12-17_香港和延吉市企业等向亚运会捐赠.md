Hong Kong and Yanji City Enterprises Donate to the Asian Games

The People's Daily, Beijing, December 16th - The Organizing Committee of the 11th Asian Games today received a donation of 20,000 bottles of Ibene Human Placenta Beauty Cream from Hong Kong's Hengfeng Trading Company and Jiejin Development Company, valued at 400,000 Hong Kong dollars. Liu Yuling, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian Games Organizing Committee, said: Recently, more and more people have shown concern and support for the Asian Games, indicating that the Asian Games have a strong unifying force. The two companies from Hong Kong specially came to Beijing to make the donation, which is a manifestation of the love for the motherland by the Chinese people and a far-sighted act.

Previously, the Changbai Chemical Factory in Yanji City, Jilin Province, donated products worth 26,000 yuan to the Asian Games Fund. The Asian Games Engineering Command has decided to use the factory's waterproof glue and other products in the Student Gymnasium project. Comrades from Changbai Chemical Factory said, "The money for this batch of products is not much, but it represents the heartfelt support of the Yanbian Korean people for the motherland."

    本报北京12月16日讯　第十一届亚运会基金会今天接受了香港恒丰贸易公司和捷进发展公司捐赠的两万瓶伊贝恩人体胎盘美容霜，总价值为40万港币。亚运会组委会常委副秘书长刘玉令说：近来，关心和支持亚运会的人越来越多，说明亚运会有很大的凝聚力。香港这两家公司专程来京捐赠，是炎黄子孙热爱祖国的表现，也是有远见的作为。
    在这之前，吉林省延吉市长白化工厂向基金会捐赠了价值人民币26000元产品。亚运会工程总指挥部已决定将该厂防水胶等产品用于大学生馆工程。长白化工厂同志说，这批产品钱不多，表示我们延边朝鲜族儿女对祖国一片心。　（成丽香）
