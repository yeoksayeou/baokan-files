Title: A Complete Historical Panorama – A Review of "Shanghai History"

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, nearly ten historians from the Shanghai History Research Institute, including Tang Zhenchang and Shen Hengchun, presented a gift of over 800,000 words to the motherland – "Shanghai History." They modestly described it as "a rough sketch of Shanghai's history." After reading it, I believe it is a complete historical panorama of Shanghai. The book has the following characteristics:

First, it is comprehensive. It is well known that since the opening of the port, Shanghai, with its unique advantages, has gradually developed into a world-renowned metropolis in the East, even being regarded as the "key to modern China." Over the decades, foreign scholars have written several books introducing Shanghai's history, but they inevitably contain political biases and are often academically superficial, lacking depth, or obscure, making it difficult to call them substantial works on Shanghai's history. A few years ago, Liu Huiwu edited "Shanghai Modern History," which became the first Shanghai history monograph in the country. Although it has its unique features, it is ultimately a history of Shanghai over the past hundred years. Tang Zhenchang and his colleagues, with the belief that "without tracing Shanghai's ancient history, it is impossible to understand modern Shanghai," spent over a decade writing this comprehensive history of Shanghai from ancient times to the present. This book provides us with a key to historically understanding Shanghai and more accurately continuing its legacy. This book, in addition to systematically explaining Shanghai's history from its formation to the liberation, consistently treats Shanghai as a whole for research, thus reflecting its comprehensiveness. Moreover, in terms of horizontal cross-sections, it strives to provide a comprehensive explanation of Shanghai's history in certain periods, covering political, economic, cultural, social, and population aspects, aiming to reveal its historical panorama and leaving readers with a sense of historical integrity. Additionally, the appendices at the end, such as the chronology of major events in Shanghai's history, the table of administrative divisions in the Shanghai region, the list of Shanghai's magistrates, the list of Shanghai's daotais, the list of Shanghai's administrative officials during the Republic of China, and the table of old and new street names in Shanghai with Chinese and foreign language comparisons, play a practical role in filling in gaps.

Second, it is scientific. The value of a scholarly work depends on its scientific nature. The scientific nature of historical works is mainly reflected in their ability to truthfully reflect the true face of history. "Shanghai History" indeed puts a lot of effort into being "truthful." First, it is reflected in the authors' insistence on constructing the overall framework of the book based on Shanghai's historical reality, aiming to reflect the characteristics or unique aspects of Shanghai's history, rather than blindly following the existing model of modern Chinese history and filling it in. For example, regarding the development stages of Shanghai's modern history, the authors insist on dividing it into three historical periods: "From the Battle of Wusong in June 1842 to the success of the Shanghai Xinhai Revolution in November 1911," "From November 1911 to July 1927, the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality," and "From July 1927 to the liberation of Shanghai in 1949." This avoids the commonly used academic standard of dividing the modern period into two stages based on the May Fourth Movement in 1919, thus better reflecting the actual development of Shanghai's history. Secondly, it is reflected in the insistence on the two-point approach, dialectically analyzing the issues in Shanghai's history, and striving to avoid blind and one-sided views. For example, the concession issue is a hotly debated topic in academia and a topic that cannot be avoided in writing Shanghai's history. "Shanghai History" has conducted a relatively cautious and in-depth study on this issue. They did not satisfy themselves with the original conclusions of viewing concessions as "adventurers' paradise" or "bridgeheads for invading China," but rather, from political, economic, cultural, and even urban construction aspects, they analyzed the complex influence of concessions on Shanghai's urban development and changes. They sharply pointed out the negative effects of concessions, their evil nature of oppressing and plundering the Chinese people, and also affirmed the objective impact of concessions on the development of modern Chinese society, thus enabling readers to have a more dialectical understanding of this historical phenomenon.

Of course, as a comprehensive history of Shanghai, this book has its shortcomings, especially in the analysis of the social psychology and ideas of the main social actors in Shanghai's cities, which is relatively weak; it pays less attention to the social organizations and activities of Shanghai's lower-class citizens; although it has paid attention to Shanghai's foreign exchanges, it has not paid enough attention to Shanghai's internal radiation. Additionally, the lack of a contemporary history section in Shanghai's history is also a regrettable matter.

    一幅完整的历史画卷
    ——《上海史》评介
    丁凤麟
    在建国四十周年的大喜日子里，上海历史研究所唐振常、沈恒春等近十位史学工作者，向祖国奉献出一份80多万字的厚礼——《上海史》。他们自谦地说，这仅仅是“一幅上海史的素描”。笔者捧读之余，却认为这是一幅完整的上海史画卷。纵观该书具有如下特色：
    一是完整性。众所周知，开埠以来的上海，以其独特优势，逐步发展成世界瞩目的东方大都会，甚至视之为“现代中国的钥匙”。数十年来，外国学者虽写过几本介绍上海历史的著作，但它们难免夹杂政治偏见，学术上也往往流于一鳞半爪，一知半解，抑或雾里看花，很难称之为像样的上海史著。数年前刘惠吾主编了《上海近代史》，成为国内第一部上海史专著，虽不乏特色，然而毕竟是近百年的上海史。唐振常等同志正是本着“不上溯古代上海，亦不足以了解近代上海的初衷，穷十余年之精力，写就了这部由古及今的上海通史，为我们历史地了解上海，更准确地继往开来，提供了一把钥匙”。这部《上海史》，除了在纵断面上系统阐述了上海从成陆开始直到解放为止的数千年变迁史，自始至终把上海城市作为一个整体予以研究，从而体现了它的完整性；此外，在横断面上也努力对上海某一阶段历史进行完整性的阐述，它涉及政治、经济、文化、社会、人口等各个侧面，力求窥其历史全貌，留给人们一种历史的整体感。此外，文末所附录的上海史大事记、上海地区建置沿革表、上海历任知县表、道台表、民国时期上海行政长官表、上海市区旧新路名中外文对照表等，起到了拾遗补缺的实际效用。
    二是科学性。一部学术论著的价值取决于它的科学性。历史论著的科学性，主要表现在它能否实事求是地反映历史的本来面目。《上海史》确实在“实事求是”上下了颇为扎实的功夫。首先，表现在作者坚持从上海的历史实际构思全书框架，力图反映上海历史本身的个性或特点，而不是盲目按照整个中国近代史的现有模式作填充式的图解。比如关于上海近代历史的发展阶段，作者坚持划分为“1842年6月中英吴淞之战至1911年11月上海辛亥起义成功”、“1911年11月至1927年7月上海特别市成立”、“1927年7月至1949年上海市解放”等三个历史阶段，避免了套用史学界通用的以1919年五四运动为界标划分近代前后两阶段的标准，从而更能符合上海历史发展的实际。其次，还表现在坚持两点论，对上海史中的问题予以辩证分析，力求避免盲目和片面。比如租界问题，是学术界论争颇为岐异的热点，也是撰写上海史不能回避的论题。《上海史》对此进行了较为审慎且又深入的研究。他们并未满足于把租界视为“冒险家的乐园”或“侵略中国的桥头堡”等的原有结论，而是从政治、经济、文化、乃至市政建设等各个方面，剖视租界对上海城市发展变化的复杂影响，既尖锐指出租界所产生的消极作用，及其对中国人民进行压迫和掠夺的罪恶本质，又肯定租界在中国近代社会发展进程中所产生的客观影响，从而使读者对租界这一历史现象有了更为辩证的认识。
    当然，就一部完整的上海通史而言，此书有其不足之处，尤其对上海城市的社会活动主体，即对人们的社会心理及其观念的分析较为薄弱；对上海低层次市民的社会组织及其活动特点较少述及；虽然注意了上海的对外交往，但上海的对内辐射力却注意不够。另外，上海通史也缺少当代史部分，总是件憾事。
