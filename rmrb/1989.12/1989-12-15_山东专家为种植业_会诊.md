A strong sense of responsibility drove over 400 experts, scholars, and professors into the fields to diagnose the problems in Shandong Province's planting industry. After more than seven months of hard work, they recently submitted over 100 specialized reports and papers to the Shandong Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government, offering advice and prescriptions to break the stagnant situation in the province's planting industry.

To break through the stagnant situation in the planting industry, in April of this year, Shandong Provincial Committee Standing Committee Member and Vice Governor Gao Changli proposed inviting experts to help come up with ideas and solutions. The Shandong Provincial Association for Science and Technology then issued calls to more than 40 academic societies and the science and technology associations of 15 cities and prefectures.

The experts frankly pointed out the problems in Shandong Province's planting industry and, with a sense of responsibility, proposed 31 strategies in seven aspects to break the stagnant situation.

    山东专家为种植业“会诊”
    据新华社济南12月14日电　（记者张百新）强烈的责任感使400多名专家、学者、教授走向田野，为山东省的种植业“会诊”找“病因”。经过7个多月的辛勤劳动，他们最近向山东省委、省政府提交了100多篇专题报告和论文，为打破山东省种植业徘徊局面献计献策，开出了一个个好的“药方”。
    为了突破种植业的徘徊局面，今年4月，山东省委常委、副省长高昌礼提议，请专家们帮助出主意想办法。山东省科协便向40多个学会，15个地市科协分别发出了号召。
    专家们直言不讳地指出了山东省在种植业方面存在的问题，又以负责的态度提出了打破种植业徘徊局面的7个方面31条对策。
