The People's Bank of China today issued a notice regarding the compensation rate for long-term savings deposits in January 1990.

The notice states that based on the comprehensive price index for retail goods and services provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, the compensation rate for three-year and above fixed-term savings deposits for January 1990 is 0.90% annually. All three-year, five-year, and eight-year fixed-term savings deposits maturing in that month will be compensated at the above rate.

The People's Bank of China's spokesperson today explained the bank's announcement of the annual compensation rate for savings in January 1990, which is 0.90%.

The spokesperson said that the value-preserving savings scheme is linked to prices, so when prices fall, the compensation rate must also decrease. Stable market prices are what the broad masses of the people yearn for. According to the price index provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, since the implementation of the value-preserving savings scheme, price changes can be divided into three stages: the first stage was the third and fourth quarters of 1988 and the first quarter of this year, when prices rose sharply, and the compensation rate, calculated based on the price index at that time, was very high, with an annual compensation rate of over 12% to 13%; the second stage was from April to June 1989, when prices were relatively stable and the compensation rate decreased; the third stage was from July to November 1989, when prices continued to decline, so the compensation rate decreased significantly. Thus, if calculated by the high and low averages of the three stages, the price increase during the savings deposit period is still slightly higher than the annual interest rate for three-year deposits, and a little more compensation is given.

The spokesperson said that if the price index continues to decline, future value-preserving savings deposits will only pay interest and will no longer have compensation. Conversely, if prices rise in the future and exceed the bank's regulated annual interest rate for three-year deposits, the bank will still provide compensation.

### 治理整顿见效　物价持续下降  明年1月保值储蓄贴补率0.9％

    治理整顿见效　物价持续下降
    明年1月保值储蓄贴补率0.9％
    新华社北京12月12日电　中国人民银行今天发布了关于1990年1月份人民币长期保值储蓄存款贴补率的公告。
    公告说，根据国家统计局统计的社会商品零售和服务项目价格总指数计算，1990年1月份三年期以上定期储蓄存款的保值贴补率为年率0.90％。凡在该月份内到期的三年、五年、八年的定期储蓄存款，均按上述贴补率给予贴补。
    新华社北京12月12日电中国人民银行新闻发言人今天就银行公布的明年1月份保值储蓄年贴补率为0.90％一事作了说明。
    这位发言人说，保值储蓄是与物价挂钩的，物价下降了，贴补率就要下降。市场物价稳定是广大人民群众所渴望的。根据国家统计局提供的物价指数，自开展保值储蓄以来，物价变动可分为三个阶段：第一阶段是1988年三、四季度和今年第一季度，物价上升很猛，参照当时的物价指数计算的贴补率都很高，年贴补率均在12％至13％以上；第二阶段是1989年4月至6月，物价比较稳定，贴补率有所下降；第三阶段是1989年7月至11月，物价持续下降，所以贴补率明显下降。这样，按三阶段高低平均计算，在保值储蓄存款期内物价上升幅度还是略高于三年期存款年利率，再稍给点补贴。
    这位发言人说，如果物价指数再继续下降，以后保值储蓄存款就只付给利息，不再有贴补了。相反，今后物价上涨超过银行规定的三年期存款年利率以上，银行仍给予贴补。
