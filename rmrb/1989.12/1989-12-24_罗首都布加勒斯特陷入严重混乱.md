Romania's capital, Bucharest, has been plunged into severe chaos since December 22, with intense gun battles raging throughout the city.

On December 22, armed forces loyal to and opposed to the government clashed violently. The Central Committee building, radio station, and television station were all seized by anti-government forces. The State Council building caught fire and was burning. According to local reports, Ceaușescu has left the presidential palace, and his whereabouts are unknown.

On December 16, mass demonstrations erupted in the western Romanian city of Timișoara. On December 21, Ceaușescu, who had just returned from an overseas visit, addressed a mass rally in the capital, calling for national stability and unity. However, the situation did not improve, and tensions escalated further.

Similar demonstrations and conflicts have also occurred in other Romanian cities, and the situation is still developing.

From last night, Bucharest has been filled with the sound of gunfire, which by this morning (Beijing time, today noon) had escalated into intense gun battles, with occasional cannon fire audible as well.

On the evening of December 22, the Romanian television station broadcast a statement announcing the formation of the "Romanian National Salvation Front Committee." The committee declared the dissolution of all power structures under Ceaușescu. Following this, security forces loyal to Ceaușescu clashed with opposing forces in the city center, with the most intense fighting occurring in the Republic Square, the radio station, and the military club "Central House of the Army." The Chinese Embassy and Xinhua News Agency office, located 6 kilometers from the city center, had their windows rattling from the gunfire, with some windows shattered by bullets.

Reports indicate that intense battles have also broken out in Romania's second-largest city, Brașov, the central city of Sibiu, and other locations.

According to foreign reports, anti-government forces are organizing a provisional government.
