The national advanced unit in preschool education, Dalian City Jinzhou District, has adopted a strategic vision of starting from childhood and improving the quality of the rural population. The district has made efforts to improve the management level and educational quality of childcare and preschool institutions. The number of preschool institutions in the district has grown to 401, with 90% of children aged 3 to 6 enrolled, basically achieving universal three-year preschool education.

After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, some cadres believed that the situation had changed and it would be difficult to consolidate and develop childcare services. To address this, the district government launched a large-scale discussion across the district on topics such as "The relationship between developing childcare services and economic development" and "The relationship between universal three-year preschool education and future population quality." This was done to guide cadres to update their concepts and start from childhood. At the same time, the district issued regulations: holding a township-level childcare work conference every half year; including preschool education in the series of general education, vocational education, and adult education, and arranging it comprehensively; holding an annual childcare work commendation conference.

The district finance allocated 150 million yuan to build preschool institutions and helped township-level childcare institutions solve investment difficulties. Under this influence, various townships invested more than 100 million yuan to build, renovate, and expand 55 childcare institutions; and raised 190 million yuan to establish 19 township-level central preschool institutions.

The quality of education depends on the quality of teachers. The district government requires that when townships recruit preschool teachers, they should open recruitment to the public, conduct open examinations, and select the best candidates. Many townships and villages hire the best candidates from among 10 to 20 applicants. Jinzhou District has established a two-level preschool teacher training network at the district and township levels. The district education commission is responsible for training township-level preschool education cadres and key teachers from central preschool institutions; the district teacher training school is responsible for cultural and professional training and teaching guidance; township-level preschool education cadres and key teachers from central preschool institutions are responsible for training village-level preschool teachers. To continuously deepen preschool education reform, the district education commission has assigned the educational science research institute to designate personnel to conduct preschool education research, focusing on topics such as "smooth transition from preschool to primary school," conducting experiments, and summarizing experiences.

    从娃娃抓起
    苏成咸
    全国幼教先进单位——大连市金州区以从娃娃抓起、提高农村人口素质的战略眼光，努力提高托幼园所的管理水平和保教质量。全区幼儿园所已发展到四百零一处，三—六周岁的儿童入托（园）数达百分之九十以上，基本上普及了三年学前教育。
    农村出现联产承包责任制后，有的干部认为，现在情况变了，巩固发展托幼事业有难度。为此，区政府在全区范围内广泛开展以“兴办托幼事业与发展经济的关系”、“普及学前三年教育与未来人口素质的关系”等为题的大讨论，引导广大干部更新观念，从娃娃抓起。同时，区里做出规定：每半年召开一次乡镇长托幼专题工作会议；把幼儿教育纳入普通教育、职业教育、成人教育系列中去，统筹安排；每年召开一次托幼工作表彰会。
    区财政拿出一百五十万元修建幼儿园，还分别帮助乡镇托幼园所解决投资困难。在此感召下，各乡镇又投资了一百多万元，新建、改建和扩建托幼园所五十五处；还集资了一百九十多万元，建立起十九个乡镇中心幼儿园所。
    保教质量如何，关键在幼师质量。区政府要求各乡镇招聘幼儿教师时，面向社会，公开招考，择优录用。不少乡镇村屯都是在一二十个报名者中聘用那些素质较好的。金州区建立起区、乡（镇）两级幼师培训网。区教委负责乡镇幼教干部和中心幼儿园骨干教师的培训；区教师进修学校负责文化业务培训和教学工作指导；乡镇幼教干部和中心幼儿园骨干教师负责村级幼儿园教师的培训。为了不断深化幼教改革，区教委还责成教科所指定专人，从事幼教科研，以“幼小衔接”等项为专题，进行实验，总结经验。
