Editor's Note: Some individuals who persist in advocating bourgeois liberalization not only hold reactionary political stances but also lack academic integrity. The compilers of "River Elegy," including Su Xiaokang, are such individuals. They extensively quote and reference, praise and criticize, and present themselves as erudite scholars, deceiving some into applauding them. However, many of their so-called profound insights are merely baseless claims and random speculations, with common knowledge errors abounding. Starting from August 9, 1989, the "Beijing Evening News" launched a column titled "101 Errors in 'River Elegy,'" publishing one article per day, totaling 101 articles, all aimed at exposing the shallowness and distortions of the authors of "River Elegy." These articles not only clarify right and wrong but also educate readers. Now, our newspaper selects some of these articles to introduce to our readers.

Not Just Ancient Greek Civilization That Flourished

Guo Xuedi

The first episode of "River Elegy" alarmingly states: "British historian Arnold Toynbee calculated that human history has seen 21 civilizations, of which 14 have vanished, six are declining, and only ancient Greek civilization has transformed into industrial civilization, sweeping the world." Is this true?

Indeed, Arnold Toynbee mentioned 21 civilizations: Western civilization, Orthodox Byzantine civilization, Orthodox Russian civilization, Persian civilization, Islamic civilization, Indian civilization, Far Eastern civilization, ancient Greek-Roman civilization, Syrian civilization, Indian civilization, Chinese civilization, Japanese-Korean civilization, Cretan civilization, Sumerian civilization, Hittite civilization, Babylonian civilization, Egyptian civilization, Andean civilization, Mexican civilization, Yucatan civilization, and Mayan civilization.

These 21 civilizations were not all calculated by Toynbee at once. They are discussed in his work "A Study of History" and were categorized differently in various contexts. Some are categorized by region, such as Far Eastern civilization; some by religion, such as Islamic civilization; and some by country, such as Russian, Chinese, and Japanese civilizations. These 21 civilizations are not all on the same level; some are inclusive.

If "River Elegy" is correct, then except for ancient Greek civilization, the other 20 civilizations have all vanished or are declining. But what about the "Western civilization" that "River Elegy" praises so highly? How do we explain the existence of the highly developed economies and cultures of the Soviet Union and Japan?

What Does "Heaven and Earth" Mean?

Shi Shi

"River Elegy" contains a strange passage: "The Yellow Emperor is the yellow land, which is the 'Earth' that Chinese people often talk about, meaning the 'Earth Mother.'" This explanation is laughable.

Chinese people refer to themselves as "descendants of Yan and Huang." Yan refers to Yan Emperor, also known as Chi Di, the "God of Fire," who ruled the "Southern Fire Deity," hence the name Yan Emperor. Huang refers to the Yellow Emperor, also known as Xuan Yuan, who had the "Earth Deity's auspicious signs," hence the name Yellow Emperor.

The character "Hou" in "Heaven and Earth" does not mean "empress." Before the Zhou Dynasty, "Hou" was synonymous with "Di," and "Di" was synonymous with "Hou." The "Shuowen Jiezi" states that the character "Hou" "resembles a human figure, issuing commands to the four directions." Examples include Hou Ji and Hou Yi. Hou Yi is also known as Di Yi. The empress of an emperor is called "Hou," which is a practice that began after the Zhou Dynasty.

"Heaven and Earth" should be understood as "Heaven and Earth," or "Heavenly God and Earth God." The Earth is considered the "Hou" because it is the ruler of all things, hence the term "Hou." When "Hou" refers to the Earth God, it is also known as "She," as mentioned in the "Spring and Autumn Annals," which states, "Gonggong's son, Qulong, became the Earth God." The "Huainanzi" also states, "Yu labored for the people and died, becoming the Earth God." Regardless of the interpretation, "Hou" has no gender connotations.

Could Alexander Have Seen the Great Wall?

Zhang Shumu

In the second episode of "River Elegy," titled "Destiny," there is a passage: "Although the vast Pamir Plateau and the Himalayas blocked the iron hooves of Macedon, the once-in-a-millennium emperor Alexander could not have imagined that if he had crossed these natural barriers, the once-in-a-millennium emperor of the East still had a Great Wall waiting for him."

There are two obvious errors in this passage:

First, the timing is incorrect. Alexander died in 323 BC, while the Great Wall was built by Qin Shi Huang after he unified China in 221 BC, starting in 214 BC. The Great Wall appeared 100 years after Alexander's death.

Second, the geographical location is incorrect. The Great Wall is located in the northern part of China. After Qin Shi Huang unified China, to defend against the invasions of northern nomadic tribes, he repaired and connected the northern borders of Qin, Zhao, and Yan into one continuous wall, stretching from Linyao (present-day Min County, Gansu) to Liaodong. The Pamir Plateau and the Himalayas, however, are far to the west in Xinjiang and Tibet. If the descendants of the Macedonian king Alexander had crossed these two natural barriers and come from the west to the east, the Great Wall in the north would not have stopped them.

Qin Shi Huang and Alexander

Xu Hongnian

"River Elegy" states that Qin Shi Huang, "this once-in-a-millennium emperor, did not wander around like Alexander but, according to the unique thinking and imagination of Eastern emperors, built the Great Wall that Alexander could not have imagined."

In fact, Greece had built a long wall from Athens to the port of Piraeus as early as the 6th century BC. Did the authors of "River Elegy" intentionally avoid mentioning this foreign long wall to belittle China's Great Wall, or did they simply not know about the long wall mentioned in middle school textbooks?

Macedonia is a region of only 20,000 to 30,000 square kilometers, and including Greece, it is only about 140,000 to 150,000 square kilometers. Alexander conquered Egypt, the Middle East, Persia, and other regions, with a total area of only about 3 million square kilometers. Qin Shi Huang, after unifying the Six States, had a territory of 4 to 5 million square kilometers. He built roads, traveled through counties, and his footsteps covered the south, north, west, and east of his ruled regions. He died on his travels. How can it be said that Qin Shi Huang "did not wander around like Alexander"?

Was Zhu Yuanzhang's Settlement of Refugees a Crime?

Guo Xuedi

The second episode of "River Elegy" states: "In history, there has probably never been an emperor like the Ming Dynasty's founding emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, who wanted to bind the people firmly to the land." He "hated those who left the land and exiled them to distant places." It questions, "Land and autocracy have bound the Chinese people for centuries. How can the Chinese people still understand freedom and trade?"

This is an unreasonable accusation against Zhu Yuanzhang.

In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang established the Ming Dynasty. At that time, China's social economy had been severely damaged and destroyed. To restore production and develop the economy, he attracted refugees and planned to resettle them in especially desolate areas such as Shandong, Huainan, and the banks of the Yellow River to cultivate and develop the land. Through the hard work of the farmers, by 1393, the cultivated land area in the country reached over 8.5 million hectares, and a large amount of barren land was turned into cultivated land; the population increased to over 60 million, an increase of 70 million compared to the peak of the Yuan Dynasty. This played an important role in consolidating the new regime, stabilizing social order, and promoting economic development.

To say that attracting refugees and resettling farmers to cultivate land is a punishment for "those who left the land" and exiling them to distant places is a great injustice to Zhu Yuanzhang!

The Emperor's Plowing Ceremony

Fan Niao

"River Elegy" discusses the ancient emperor's "plowing ceremony." After showing the "weathered altar base" of the Temple of Agriculture in Beijing, the narration is as follows: "The emperor and his ministers come here every year to perform the 'plowing ceremony.' The emperor, with his right hand holding a lacquered dragon plow, his left hand holding a whip, and assisted by two elderly men, walks three times on this altar symbolizing the land, thus completing the 'plowing ceremony'..."

The authors of "River Elegy" obviously did not understand the "plowing ceremony" and spoke without knowing.

The emperor's plowing ceremony was not performed on the "altar" but in the "plowed field." The "Qinding Riju Jiuwen Kao," compiled during the reign of the Qing Emperor Qianlong, records: "The Temple of Agriculture is located south of the Altar of Land and Grain, next to the Altar of the Earth. It was built during the Yongle reign." The book has many records of "plowing the plowed field," all indicating that the emperor did not plow on the "altar."

The ceremony of plowing the plowed field is also different from what is written in "River Elegy." The "Riju Jiuwen Kao" records the plowing ceremony of the 15th year of Chongzhen: "The emperor again personally sacrificed at the Temple of Agriculture and performed the plowing ceremony. The Minister of Revenue, Fu Shuxun, presented the plow and hoe, and the Magistrate of Shuntian, Zhang Junjing, presented the whip. The emperor held the plow with his left hand and the whip with his right hand, pushing the plow three times through the field and stopping at the end of the furrow. During the plowing, the musicians of the Imperial Music Bureau sang the song of the harvest on both sides, and two old men led the oxen, and two men assisted the plowing..."

Did the Apollo Astronauts Come from Europa?

Huang Shaoming

The third episode of "River Elegy" states: "Those astronauts who first landed on the moon are probably the most proud individuals of this era. However, they are almost all from Europa." Europa refers to Europeans. However, the fact is that all the astronauts who landed on the moon were Americans.

Of course, the white population of the United States is mostly of European descent. However, since the United States became an independent country 200 years ago, it is no longer part of Europe. Now, the authors of "River Elegy" refer to the astronauts who landed on the moon as almost all being from Europa, which is a case of mistaken identity.

Errors in "River Elegy's" Use of Yellow River Historical Data

Wang Faxing

The television series "River Elegy" uses many incorrect historical data about the Yellow River. Here are a few examples:

1. "River Elegy" states: "The current Yellow River dikes were built during the early years of the Guangxu reign." In fact, the current dikes are not from the late Qing Dynasty. The dikes in the Zhengzhou area were formed later and were built during the Kangxi reign. Kangxi and Guangxu are separated by about 200 years.

2. "River Elegy" states: After the early years of the Guangxu reign (1875 AD), "in just a few decades, the Yellow River became a river above ground." It seems that before this, the Yellow River was an underground river. In fact, the suspended river had already formed. The dikes in the Zhengzhou area, such as the breach at Yangqiao in Zhongmou during the 26th year of Qianlong (1761 AD), and the breach near Huayuankou in Zhengzhou during the 7th year of Tongzhi (1868 AD).

3. "River Elegy" states: "The Yellow River dikes are being quietly hollowed out by ants and moles." It is not surprising that there are ants and moles on the Yellow River dikes, and the local people are always catching them. In the suburbs of Zhengzhou, from 1951 to 1983, 34,386 harmful animals were caught, including 42 badgers. To investigate the various causes of cracks in the dikes, from 1951 to 1983, 1.9 million holes were drilled in the 32-kilometer dikes in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. All the hidden dangers found in the dikes were promptly repaired by digging, rebuilding, sand filling, grouting, and pressure grouting. The authors of "River Elegy" ignore these facts and falsely claim that "the Yellow River dikes are being quietly hollowed out by ants and moles," which is sheer nonsense!

4. "River Elegy" states that the Yellow River "has some sections that rise an average of 22 centimeters per year." According to this calculation, since the founding of the People's Republic, this section of the river has risen 8.8 meters, which is unacceptable! The author did not specify which section of the river. Taking the typical section of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, Huayuankou, as an example, from June 1954 to May 1979, over 25 years, the riverbed rose by 1.91 meters. Even excluding the four years of clear water release from Sanmenxia, the average over 21 years is only about 9 centimeters. The authors of "River Elegy" greatly exaggerate the amount of silt deposition, and their intentions are unclear!

Was the 18th and 19th Centuries a Time of Sorrow for China?

Ren Ke

The third episode of "River Elegy" states: "The 16th and 17th centuries were indeed a time of great sorrow for the Chinese people." Regarding the second wave of foreign cultural impact, "China no longer had the broad-mindedness and grandeur of the Han and Tang dynasties." The authors believe that as early as the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasties, Chinese civilization was far inferior to the West.

I happen to have a set of books by the famous Japanese historian Professor Nobusuke Shinobu. This book is quite authoritative in the Japanese academic community. Here is a brief introduction:

"At that time, in the 17th and early 18th centuries, China was under the rule of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. China was not only advanced compared to Japan but also to Europe. It was more about exporting culture than absorbing foreign culture. Kangxi Emperor respected Western European science, especially French science and culture, and particularly liked using Paris-made crafts. He valued Western astronomy, calendars, and mathematical knowledge and established institutions in the palace to study them..."

"American scholar John Fairbank once pointed out: Until about a century and a half ago, China's influence on Western life was much greater than the influence of the West on Chinese life. British Orientalist Hudson, when discussing the mutual influence between China and Europe from ancient times to the end of the 18th century, even believed that China's influence on Europe was much greater than what it received from Europe. He said: China left an indelible mark on European culture in the 18th century and was able to outshine its future conquerors and make them dizzy."

"Even in military terms, China at that time was not inferior to Europe. In the late 17th century, Russia, advancing eastward into Siberia, and southward to compete with the Qing Dynasty for territorial rights in the Heilongjiang River basin, failed..."

Professor Shinobu also said: "From the 17th to the early 18th century, in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western powers, in terms of trade, China was obviously in a superior position compared to Europe and Japan. In terms of culture, it was also not disadvantageous to China."

If we objectively analyze and interpret historical data, we can see: until the 18th century, China's handicraft industry was superior to Europe in many technological and artistic aspects. At that time, although Europe had some unique products, such as clocks, the production methods and technological levels had not fundamentally surpassed China's handicraft industry. The Palace Museum's collection of Qing Dynasty craftsmen's Western-style clock replicas shows that China could almost completely reach the entire technological level of the West at that time. It was only in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that China's handicraft industry gradually fell behind the new type of industry that emerged after the Industrial Revolution in Europe in terms of technological level and industrial scale.

Lin Zexu: The First Person in the Qing Dynasty to Look at the World

Bao Chun

"River Elegy" portrays Lin Zexu, the hero of the Opium War, as very ignorant and backward, saying that he "had regressed to the level of knowledge before the arrival of the Jesuit Matteo Ricci." (Note: According to "River Elegy," Matteo Ricci came to China in 1582 and first told the Chinese that they were not in the center of the world but in a certain place in the Northern Hemisphere.)

This is a slander against Lin Zexu.

Lin Zexu was born in 1785 and died in 1850. In 1839, he went to Guangzhou to implement the ban on opium, not only as a representative of the resistance against foreign aggression at that time but also as the first person in the Qing Dynasty to look at the world. As the anti-opium movement and the struggle against Britain developed, to know the enemy and oneself, to understand the situation of Western countries, and to serve the needs of the struggle, he organized some people in his office to translate foreign books and newspapers. He also organized the translation of the book "A General Survey of the World" by the British Murray, compiling it into "Zhou Hai Zhi." The book records the geography and history of more than 30 countries in the five continents, the first relatively systematic world geography in China. Later, his friend Wei Yuan expanded it into "Hai Guo Tu Zhi." Then, he compiled and translated the book "Hua Yi Yi Yuan," to understand the views and opinions of foreigners on Chinese affairs, which was beneficial for taking corresponding measures in a timely manner. Lin Zexu also attached part of the content to his memorial to the Daoguang Emperor, which was very difficult at that time. In addition, he purchased a 1,080-ton British-built ship, the "Ganmi Li Zhi," and converted it into a warship. He also bought 200 cannons from abroad to equip the Tiger Gate Fort.

It was precisely because of Lin Zexu's actions that he aroused strong dissatisfaction among the conservative elements in the ruling class. Qishan once accused Lin Zexu of "as a high official of the Celestial Empire, spending all day spying on foreign affairs." From this, it can be seen that Lin Zexu was not a person lacking in world knowledge but precisely a pioneer in modern history who looked at the world.

The Advantages of Unification for Economic and Cultural Development

Liao Weizhang

The fifth episode of "River Elegy" states: "The ghost of unification seems to still be wandering on the land of China," calling it an "ancient social disease." This is unreasonable.

"Unification" means unifying the entire territory. China is a multi-ethnic country with a vast territory. Unification, peace under heaven, prosperity, and flourishing culture are the common wishes of all ethnic groups. The formation of unification has strongly promoted economic development, created a brilliant civilization, and formed excellent national traditions.

Looking at Chinese history, periods of national unification are always times of economic prosperity and cultural flourishing. On the contrary, when the country is divided, warlords are in power, foreign invaders enter, and there are continuous wars, the people suffer, and society is severely damaged. The Three Kingdoms, Western Jin, the Sixteen Kingdoms, the Five Dynasties, and the Ten Kingdoms are examples. In the long history of Chinese feudal society, outstanding politicians such as Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, and Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty all made outstanding contributions to maintaining national unity and territorial integrity and are praised, while those who sell out the country and seek glory and those who split the country are despised by the Chinese people. This is not without reason.

Are All People Around the Mediterranean Europeans?

Xiao Liu

To praise the advanced and open nature of Europe and America and satirize the backwardness and conservatism of China, "River Elegy" states in its second episode: "The Chinese people do not live around the Mediterranean like European nations, nor do they live between two oceans like Americans." This statement has a fatal error, as it refers to all people around the Mediterranean as "European nations."

Anyone with basic geographical knowledge knows that "European nations" live on the northern shore of the Mediterranean. The southern shore of the Mediterranean includes Asian countries such as Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon, and African countries such as Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.

Has anyone ever said that "the Chinese people live around the Pacific"?

Did Plato and King Xuan of Qi Exist Simultaneously?

Huang Shaoming

The third episode of "River Elegy" contains the following passage: "When King Xuan of Qi established the Jixia Academy and gathered scholars of various schools, Plato also established an academy in Athens by the Mediterranean, and Aristotle studied there." This is a random alteration of history.

Plato established his academy in 387 BC, 68 years before King Xuan of Qi ascended the throne (319 BC). When King Xuan of Qi ascended the throne, Plato was no longer alive (he died in 347 BC), and even his student Aristotle had been dead for 3 years (322 BC). To say that the Jixia Academy and Plato's academy were established at the same time is absurd!

Where Does Zhuge Liang Rest?

Gong Hua

To illustrate that traditional Chinese culture despises knowledge and scholars, "River Elegy" uses Nanyang as an example. It states that Nanyang is the resting place of three outstanding figures in history. Their posthumous treatment, however, is so different that it seems to reveal the secrets of history to us. The three outstanding figures mentioned by "River Elegy" are the great scientist Zhang Heng, the medical sage Zhang Zhongjing, and the prime minister of Shu Han, Zhuge Liang.

This is sheer nonsense.

Anyone who has read the history of the Three Kingdoms knows that in the 12th year of Jianxing (234 AD), Zhuge Liang led a large army to Qishan and Xiegu, facing off against Sima Yi at Wuzhang Plains. After 100 days, he fell ill and died in the army. According to his will, his body was buried in Dingjun Mountain, now in the southeast of Mian County, Shaanxi Province. How could Zhuge Liang be resting in Nanyang?

After Zhuge Liang's death, the people of Shu Han held wild memorial ceremonies. With the permission of Liu Shan, a temple was built in Yunyang to commemorate him.

Zhuge Liang was a great politician and also a great scholar. His "Outgoing Memorial" still moves people's hearts today. It is said that he invented the "wooden ox and flowing horse"—the chicken cart, which is still used as a means of transportation in the countryside of Sichuan today. Zhuge Liang is the embodiment of wisdom, and he has been revered by the people throughout history, which is a manifestation of respect for knowledge and scholars.

Were Ancestor Chongzhi and Song Yingxing Commoners?

Zhang Shumu

"River Elegy" states: "Has anyone seen the tombs of the lifelong commoners, the great scientists Ancestor Chongzhi and Song Yingxing?" This claim that Ancestor Chongzhi and Song Yingxing were lifelong commoners is sheer nonsense.

The "Book of the Southern Dynasties," Volume 72, contains the biography of Ancestor Chongzhi. It states: "Ancestor Chongzhi, styled Wen Yuan, was from Rangyang. His great-grandfather Tai Zhi was a minister of the Jin Dynasty. His grandfather Chang was the Minister of Works of the Song Dynasty. His father Shu Zhi was a court official." From this, it can be seen that Ancestor Chongzhi was born into an official family. "Chongzhi studied ancient texts and had a keen mind. The Emperor Xiaowu of the Liu Song Dynasty appointed him to the Directorate of Education and granted him a residence, carriage, and clothing." From this, it can be seen that the Emperor Xiaowu of the Liu Song Dynasty valued Ancestor Chongzhi. The biography of Ancestor Chongzhi continues, stating that he began his official career as the Magistrate of Nankang County and later served as the Minister of Ceremonies. At this time, he created the lost south-pointing chariot. The Prince Wenhui saw his calendar and submitted it to the Emperor Wu for implementation, but it was not implemented due to the death of the Prince Wenhui. Later, Ancestor Chongzhi was appointed as the Commander of the Water Defense Corps and continued in his position. "During the reign of Emperor Ming, the emperor wanted Ancestor Chongzhi to travel around the country, promoting great undertakings that would benefit the people. However, due to continuous military affairs, the plan was not implemented."

Song Yingxing was a famous scientist in the late Ming Dynasty. The "Book of Ancient Chinese Scientists" states: "Song Yingxing, styled Changeng, was born in the northern town of Fencheng County, Jiangxi Province, in the late Wanli period (around 1597 AD) into an official landlord family. In 1615 AD, during the 43rd year of Wanli, Song Yingxing and his brother Song Yingsheng participated in the provincial examination in Nanchang and both passed. Song Yingxing ranked third, and his brother ranked sixth... In 1643 AD, during the 7th year of Chongzhen, Song Yingxing was appointed as the educational supervisor of Fenyi County, Jiangxi. In 1637 AD, during the 10th year, he published 'Tian Gong Kai Wu,' and in 1638 AD, during the 11th year, he was appointed as the magistrate of Tingzhou Prefecture, Fujian. In 1641 AD, during the 14th year, he was transferred to the magistrate of Bozhou, Anhui, and returned to his hometown in Jiangxi at the end of the Chongzhen reign (1644 AD), dying during the early years of the Qing Shunzhi reign."

From this, it can be seen that Ancestor Chongzhi and Song Yingxing were not "lifelong commoners."

Why Did the Translation of "Elements" Stop?

Huang Shaopeng

"River Elegy" states: "Matteo Ricci brought the 15-volume 'Elements' from the West, and together with Xu Guangqi, they translated the first six volumes. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the translation stopped for nearly 200 years... The new elements of Chinese civilization were thus repeatedly strangled in periodic great turmoil." This is contrary to historical facts.

The Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci came to China in 1582 and began translating the 15-volume "Elements" with Xu Guangqi in 1606. In 1607, they completed the translation of the first six volumes. At this time, Matteo Ricci requested to stop the translation, suggesting that "first, let the comrades see and practice it. If it is useful, then we can plan the rest." Soon after, Matteo Ricci fell ill and died. More than twenty years later, in 1633, Xu Guangqi also passed away. Both translators were no longer in the world, and the translation of "Elements" naturally stopped.

The Ming Dynasty fell in 1644, 34 years after Matteo Ricci's death and 11 years after Xu Guangqi's death. What does the fall of the Ming Dynasty have to do with the interruption of the translation of "Elements"?

The late Qing Dynasty mathematician Li Shanlan and the British William Woolly translated the remaining nine volumes of "Elements," which were published in 1857, 250 years after the first six volumes, not the "nearly 200 years" mentioned in "River Elegy."

Was Zheng He's Voyage to the Western Seas a Political Parade?

Bao Chun

The authors of "River Elegy" state that Zheng He's voyage to the Western Seas was "a nearly pure political parade" and that he was a "gentleman who rectified righteousness without seeking profit."

The facts are not so. According to the "History of the Ming Dynasty," it is recorded: "The Chengzu Emperor suspected that the Huizong Emperor had fled to the sea and wanted to track him down, and also wanted to show off his military might abroad, demonstrating China's strength." Here, there are clearly two purposes: one is to track down the fleeing Huizong Emperor, and the other is to show off military might abroad.

During Zheng He's voyage to the Western Seas, in Aden on the Arabian Peninsula, he conducted precious goods trading. In Jiuzhen, because the chief Chen Zuyi wanted to attack the fleet, he was captured and brought back to the capital to be executed. In Sri Lanka, the king Alagakkonara lured Zheng He into the country, demanding gold coins, and sent soldiers to plunder the fleet, but Zheng He saw through the trick, leading more than 2,000 people to attack and capture the city, capturing Alagakkonara and his wife and officials. In Sumatra, the former king's son Su Ganla also sent soldiers to attack the fleet, but Zheng He fought back and defeated the enemy, pursuing them to Nanhai, capturing Su.

Zheng He's voyage to the Western Seas not only showed off military might abroad but also implemented the open policy of the Chengzu Emperor, strengthening economic and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and African and Asian peoples. The results were twofold: on the one hand, it stimulated the growth of commodity production at home, such as the silk and porcelain industries; on the other hand, it also brought medicinal materials, spices, and Western fabrics from various regions of Asia and Africa to China.

Those who accompanied Zheng He on his missions, such as Ma Huan, Fei Xin, and Gong Zhen, wrote books such as "Yingya Shenglan," "Xingcha Shenglan," and "Xiyang Fan Guo Zhi" based on their personal experiences and observations, providing extremely valuable materials for later generations to study the history and geography of these regions.

Therefore, Zheng He's voyage to the Western Seas was not a "nearly pure political parade" and was not a "gentleman who did not seek profit."

Strange Comparisons

Sun Can

To prove that "the 16th and 17th centuries were indeed a time of great sorrow for the Chinese people," the authors of "River Elegy" made two unique comparisons: first, "When Wang Yangming was meditating and trying to understand bamboo, Leonardo da Vinci was dissecting corpses while painting the Mona Lisa, Magellan completed his earliest circumnavigation, and Copernicus was preparing to publish 'On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'"; second, "When Gu Yanwu was devoted to correcting ancient characters, Galileo invented the telescope, Harvey published his treatise on the circulation of blood, and Newton established calculus." The conclusion is: "Westerners studied stars, the human body, levers, and chemical substances, while the Chinese studied books, characters, and piles of old documents."

The first oddity is that incomparable people and events are forcibly compared. Wang Yangming was a philosopher, and Gu Yanwu was a thinker. Their main work belonged to what is now called the social sciences. How can one force them to compare with Western natural scientists, physicians, and navigators? In fact, at that time, Li Shizhen was completing his 1.9 million-word masterpiece "Compendium of Materia Medica," Xu Guangqi was translating "Elements" and compiling "Agricultural Policy," Song Yingxing was writing the ancient scientific and technological masterpiece "Tian Gong Kai Wu," and Xu Xiake was conducting scientific expeditions... Shouldn't the achievements of these people be mentioned?

The second oddity is to attack one point and ignore the rest. Taking Gu Yanwu as an example, he participated in the anti-eunuch power struggle in his youth. When the Qing troops invaded, he joined the anti-Qing uprising in his hometown. His learning was extensive, and his achievements were abundant, making him famous at the time. In the fields of national institutions, local history, astronomy, instruments, military affairs, agriculture, and classics, he had profound research and unique contributions. How can one, because Gu Yanwu once corrected ancient characters, pull him out to share the blame for China's scientific and technological backwardness in modern times?

Can Movie Scenes Be Taken as Historical Facts?

Gong Hua

A movie based on historical events is not the same as the historical events themselves. However, when "River Elegy" discusses the history of the Sino-Japanese War, it uses scenes from a movie rather than historical facts. See for yourself: "The direct cause of the defeat in the Battle of the Yellow Sea was that a corrupt contractor filled many of the shells with sand. The Chinese fleet, which was deployed in a semicircle, still did not know who to obey when the battle began..."

On the morning of September 17, 1894, the Battle of the Yellow Sea was commanded by Admiral Ding Ruchang. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at the beginning and had to be commanded by Liu Buca. Liu commanded the Dingyuan, ramming and destroying an enemy ship, and then hitting the Japanese naval command ship carrying the naval commander. The captain of the Jingyuan, Ye Zuxiu, saw that the mast of the Dingyuan was broken, so he took the initiative to raise the flag and command. Therefore, this battle was not "still did not know who to obey when the battle began."

Questioning "Maritime Power Leads to Democratic Revolution"

Huang Shaoming

The sixth episode of "River Elegy" states: "Maritime power led to democratic revolution," and "the social premise of modern Western bourgeois revolutions was also the opening of European overseas routes."

If these arguments can be established, then democratic revolutions should have started first in the countries with the most developed maritime industry in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain. However, as everyone knows, the facts are the opposite. These two countries' bourgeois democratic revolutions were relatively late in Europe.

Did Yan Fu and Ito Hirobumi Study Together?

Guo Xuedi

The sixth episode of "River Elegy" states that the great enlightenment thinker of modern China, Yan Fu, "finally retreated to the embrace of Confucianism," and "his classmate at the British Naval Academy, Ito Hirobumi, however, served as the Prime Minister of Japan several times, leading this island nation to quickly enter the ranks of world powers."

This passage contains two errors.

According to historical records, Ito Hirobumi studied naval technology in Britain in 1863 for only half a year. At that time, Yan Fu was only 9 years old. After the Meiji Restoration in Japan in 1868, Ito served as the governor of Hyogo Prefecture. In 1877, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun for his role in suppressing the Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigo Takamori and was appointed Minister of the Interior in 1878. Yan Fu, however, studied at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Britain, from 1877 to 1879. How could they have been classmates?

In the 1870s, the person who studied naval construction at the British Naval Academy was Heihachiro Togo. This person later served as the captain of the Japanese "Naniwa" and was very active in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. He later rose to the rank of Admiral and Marshal of the Japanese Navy. If one says that Yan Fu and Togo were "classmates," it might be somewhat related (Togo went to Britain in 1871, six years before Yan Fu).

After Yan Fu returned from Britain in 1879, he taught at the Tianjin North China Naval Academy for nearly 20 years, consistently advocating for reform. After the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform, Yan Fu devoted himself to systematically introducing and spreading Western capitalist culture for more than a decade. His "final retreat to the embrace of Confucianism" was after the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. However, as early as 1906, Ito Hirobumi had been assassinated by a Korean patriot at the Harbin train station in northeastern China.

    谬误百出的《河殇》
    编者按　一些坚持资产阶级自由化的人，不仅政治立场反动，在治学方面也不老实。《河殇》编撰者苏晓康等人就是这样。他们广征博引，评古论今，褒贬扬抑，俨然学贯中西的饱学之士，骗得一些人喝采。然而，他们的许多高论实属信口开河、东拉西扯，常识性的谬误俯拾即是。《北京晚报》自今年8月9日起开辟《河殇百谬》专栏，日载一文，共登出101篇，专揭《河殇》作者的浅薄无知和对史实史料的歪曲篡改。这些文章不仅能澄清是非，还使人增长知识。现在，本报选摘其中部分文章，介绍给读者。
    并非古希腊文明一枝独放
    郭学棣
    《河殇》第一集就危言耸听地说：“英国历史学家汤因比计算过，人类历史上一共出现过21种文明，其中14个已经绝迹，六个正在衰朽，只有古希腊文明转化成了工业文明，浪潮席卷全世界。”果真如此吗？
    不错，阿诺德·汤因比曾提到过21种文明，它们是：西方文明，正统拜占庭文明，正统俄罗斯文明，波斯文明，伊斯兰文明，印度文明，远东文明，古希腊罗马文明，叙利亚文明，印第安文明，中国文明，日本——朝鲜文明，克里特文明，苏末尔文明，赫梯文明，巴比伦文明，埃及文明，安第斯文明，墨西哥文明，尤卡坦文明，马雅文明。
    这21种文明并不是汤因比一次“计算”出来的。而是在他的《历史研究》这部著作中分别谈到的，并在不同场合，用了不同的标准来划分。有的按地区划分，如远东文明；有的按宗教划分，如伊斯兰文明；有的按国家划分，如俄罗斯、中国、日本文明。这21种文明之间，不是并列关系，有的则是包含关系。
    如果真像《河殇》所言，除古希腊文明外，其他20种文明均已绝迹或衰朽，那么，为《河殇》极力推崇的“西方文明”又安在？经济、文化高度发达的苏联、日本的现实存在，又当如何解释？
    何谓“皇天后土”
    矢石
    《河殇》中有段奇文：“黄帝就是黄色的土地，也就是中国人常爱谈的那个‘皇天后土’的‘后土’，意思是地母。”读了这种解释，令人发笑。
    中国人自称是“炎黄子孙”。炎指炎帝，也称赤帝，即神农氏，因“其神祝融”，为“南方火德之帝”，故称炎帝。黄指黄帝，即轩辕氏，“有土德之瑞”，因而称黄帝。
    “皇天后土”的“后”字，并非是“后妃”之“后”。在商以前，后即帝，帝即后。《说文》中说，后字“象人之形，施令以告四方”。如后稷，后羿。后羿，也称为帝羿。帝王的正妻称后，是周以后的事。
    皇天后土，应理解为“天与地”，也可解释成“天神与土地神”。以土为后，即同以天为皇。“因土为群物之主，故称后也”。后土指土神时，即“社”，《春秋传》中说，“共工之子句龙为社神”。而《淮南子》中说，“禹劳天下而死为社”。不论哪种解释，“后土”都没有性别色彩。
    亚历山大能见到秦长城吗？
    张树桐
    《河殇》第二集“命运”有这么一段话：“虽然，巨大的帕米尔高原和喜马拉雅山挡住了马其顿的铁蹄，但千古一帝的亚历山大做梦也想不到，他即使越过了巨大的自然屏障，东方那个千古一帝还有一道万里长城在等着他。”
    这当中，有两处明显的错误：
    其一是时间不对。亚历山大病死于公元前323年，而万里长城是秦始皇赢政公元前221年统一中国后，于公元前214年开始修建的。万里长城出现时，亚历山大已经死了100多年。
    其二是地理位置不对。长城位于中国大地的北部。秦始皇统一中国后，为了抵御北方游牧民族的南侵，将秦、赵、燕三国的北边长城予以修缮，连贯为一，西起临洮（今甘肃岷县），东至辽东。而帕米尔高原和喜马拉雅山则在远离长城一线的西部——新疆和西藏。如果马其顿国王亚历山大的后人越过了这两大自然屏障，由西向东而来，北部的万里长城是挡不着他的。
    秦始皇与亚历山大
    徐红年
    《河殇》说，秦始皇“这位千古一帝，决不像亚历山大那样四处游荡，而是按照东方帝王特有的思维习惯和想象力，修筑了亚历山大做梦也想不到的万里长城。”
    其实，希腊早在公元前六世纪就修起了从雅典到比雷埃夫斯港的长城。《河殇》作者是为了贬低中国的长城而有意回避这道洋长城呢，还是根本就不知道中学课本上就曾讲到的这一条长城？
    马其顿是一片仅有二三万平方公里土地的地区，加上希腊也不过十四五万平方公里。亚历山大征服了埃及、西亚、波斯等地，总计面积也不过300万平方公里。秦始皇统一六国后，其版图面积达四五百万平方公里，他修驰道，巡行郡县，足迹遍及他统治地区的南北西东，最后死在巡行的路上。怎能说秦始皇“不像亚历山大那样四处游荡”呢？
    朱元璋安置流民何罪之有？
    郭学棣
    《河殇》第二集说：“历史上大约还不曾有过像明太祖朱元璋这样一位要把百姓牢牢绑在土地上的皇帝。”“他对离开土地的人深恶痛绝，一律‘迁之远方’”。诘问“土地和专制把中国人捆死了，几百年下来，中国人怎么还能懂得自由和贸易呢？”这是对朱元璋的无理指责。
    1368年，朱元璋建立明王朝。当时中国社会经济已遭到严重的摧残与破坏，为了恢复生产，发展经济，他招诱流亡，有计划地移民到山东、淮南、黄河两岸等特别荒芜的地区开荒屯田。经过广大农民的辛勤耕作，到1393年，全国垦田面积达850多万顷，大量荒田垦为熟地；人口增到6000多万，比元朝极盛时期还增加700万。这对巩固新政权、稳定社会秩序、促进经济发展，都起到重要作用。
    把招诱流民和迁徙农民去垦荒，说成是“对离开土地的人”予以“迁之远方”的惩罚，岂不是对朱元璋的莫大冤枉！
    天子亲耕在耤田
    凡鸟
    《河殇》讲到古代皇帝的“亲耕”。在画面上出现北京先农坛“斑驳陈旧的坛基”后，解说词是这样说的：“天子和大臣们，每年都要来这里举行‘亲耕’。皇帝右手扶着漆金的雕龙犁，左手执鞭，在两名老者的搀扶下，在这象征土地的祭坛上步行三次，就算完成了‘亲耕’……”
    《河殇》作者显然没有闹清“亲耕”，就信口开河。
    天子亲耕，并不是在“祭坛上”，而是在“耤田”中。清乾隆皇帝时修的《钦定日下旧闻考》记载：“先农坛在山川坛内太岁坛旁之西南，永乐中建。”“台南为耤田。”该书有不少“耕耤田”的记载，都说明皇帝不是在“祭坛上”耕。
    耕耤田的仪式，与《河殇》中写的也不同。《日下旧闻考》记载明崇祯十五年的一次耕耤礼：“上（皇帝）复亲祭先农坛，行耕耤礼。户部尚书傅淑训进耒耜，顺天府尹张宸极进鞭，上左手秉耒，右手执鞭，三推步行犁土中，尽垅而止。耕时，教坊司引红旗两旁唱禾词，老人牵牛二人，扶耕二人……”
    登上月球的是欧罗巴人吗？
    黄少明
    《河殇》第三集说：“那一批批先登上月球的宇航员们，大约也是这个时代最得意的佼佼者。可是，他们几乎都是欧罗巴人。”欧罗巴人即欧洲人。然而事实是，登上月球的全都是美国人。
    当然，美国的白种人基本上都是欧洲人的后裔。但是自从200年前美国作为一个独立国家出现之后，美国就不再属于欧洲了。现在《河殇》的作者将登上月球的宇航员说成几乎都是欧罗巴人，岂不是张冠李戴了吗？
    《河殇》引用黄河史料的谬误
    王法星
    《河殇》这部电视片使用的许多有关黄河资料是不正确的。现略举数例——
    一、《河殇》说：“今天的黄河大堤，修筑于光绪初年。”其实现今堤防不是清末才修筑的。郑州地区现今的堤防形成较晚，也是康熙年间修筑的。康熙与光绪，前后相差200来年。
    二、《河殇》说：清光绪初年（公元1875年）以后，“仅仅20几年，（黄河）就又变成了地上河”。似乎在此以前黄河是地下河似的。其实悬河之势早已形成。郑州地区中牟的杨桥决口于乾隆二十六年（公元1761年），郑州花园口附近的一次决口于同治七年（公元1868年）。
    三、《河殇》说：“黄河大堤正在被蝼蚁和田鼠悄悄蛀空。”黄河大堤上有一些蝼蚁和田鼠并不奇怪，沿河人民随时都在捕杀。仅郑州郊区，从1951年到1983年就捕杀了害堤动物34386只，其中獾狐42只。为了调查各种给大堤内部造成隙缝的原因，从1951年到1983年在郑州郊区32公里的大堤上已经锥了190多万眼，对发现的堤身隐患都及时地进行了挖填、翻筑、灌沙、灌浆乃至压力灌浆。《河殇》作者视而不见，妄言“黄河大堤正在被蝼蚁和田鼠蛀空”，岂不是白日说梦！
    四、《河殇》说，黄河“有的河段平均每年要抬高22厘米”。按此计算，建国以来这段河就抬高了8.8米，那还了得！作者没有说这是哪段河道。拿黄河下游的典型河段花园口来说吧，从1954年6月到1979年5月，25年间，河道淤高了1.91米，即使排除三门峡下泄清水的4年，以21年平均的话，每年也不过9厘米。《河殇》作者大幅度地夸大泥沙淤积量，不知用意何在！
    那是中国人伤心的二百年吗？
    任可
    《河殇》第三集说：“16、17这两个世纪，的确是令中国人十分心酸的200年。”对第二次外来文化的冲击，“中国已经没有往日汉唐那样的胸襟和气魄了”。作者认为，早在明清交会之际，中国文明就已经远远不如西方了。
    我手头恰好有一套日本著名历史学家信夫清三郎教授的书。这本书在日本史学界是比较有权威的。兹简略介绍如下——
    “当时，即17世纪至18世纪前半期，中国值康熙皇帝统治的清朝，中国不仅对于日本，就是对于欧洲来说，毋宁也是个先进国家。它与其说是吸收外来文化，不如说是向外输出文化。”“康熙皇帝尊重西欧科学，特别是法国的科学文化，尤其喜爱使用巴黎制造的工艺品。他重视西方的天文历法和数学知识，在宫中设立机构进行研究……”
    “美国研究东方学的学者费正清曾经指出：直至一个半世纪前，中国在西方的生活中所起的作用，要比西方在中国的生活中所起的作用大得多。英国的东方学者赫德森在论及从古代至18世纪末中国与欧洲之间的相互影响时，他甚至认为中国给予欧洲的影响要比它接受欧洲的影响大得多。他说：中国在18世纪欧洲文化的传统中留下了难以消除的痕迹，并能比它未来的征服者高出一筹而使之神魂颠倒。”
    “甚至在军事上，当时的中国也决不比欧洲逊色。17世纪末，东进西伯利亚的俄国，南下与清朝争夺黑龙江流域的领土权失败……”
    信夫教授还说：“从17世纪至18世纪前半期，在东西方力量相互影响的对比中，就贸易方面看，中国与欧洲、日本相比，显然占据优势地位。从文化方面看，也决非对中国不利。”
    如果客观地分析和解释史料，就会看出：直到18世纪以前，中国手工业尚在许多技术、工艺方面优于欧洲。当时欧洲的手工业虽有一些独家产品，如钟表，但生产方式和技术水平，并未根本性地超过中国当时的手工业。故宫现藏清朝工匠的西洋钟表仿制品表明，西方当时的全部技术水平，中国几乎完全能够达到。只是在18世纪末、19世纪初叶，中国手工业在技术水平与产业规模上，才逐渐与欧洲工业革命后出现的新型工业拉开明显差距。
    林则徐是清朝“放眼看世界的第一人”
    包纯
    《河殇》把“虎门销烟”的民族英雄林则徐说成是很愚昧无知的，说他“对这个世界的常识，已经倒退到利玛窦神父来华之前的水平了”。（注：据《河殇》里说，利玛窦在1582年来中国，他第一次告知中国人，你们不在世界的中央，而是在北半球的某个地方。）
    这纯属对林则徐的诬蔑。
    林则徐生于1785年，卒于1850年。他在1839年赴广州实行禁烟，不仅是当时反抗外国侵略的杰出代表，同时又是清朝“放眼看世界的第一人”。随着禁烟运动和抗英斗争的不断发展，为了知己知彼，了解西方国家的情况，以利斗争的需要，他组织一些人在自己的衙门内翻译外文书报。他还组织翻译了英国人慕瑞写的《世界地理大全》，把它编成《四洲志》。书中记述了世界五大洲30多国的地理和历史，是中国第一部较系统的世界地理志。后来，他的友人魏源在这本书的基础上，扩编成为《海国图志》。接着又译辑了《华事夷言》一书，以了解外国人对中国事情的看法和意见，有利于及时采取相应的措施。林则徐还把其中一部分内容附在奏章中给道光皇帝看，这在当时是很不容易的。此外，他还从美商购进英制1080吨的甘米力治号船，改作兵船。从海外买进200门大炮，装备虎门要塞。
    正因为林则徐有上述作为，引起统治集团中顽固分子的强烈不满。琦善就曾指责林则徐“以天朝大吏，终日刺探外洋情事”。由此可见，林则徐绝对不是缺乏世界常识的愚昧之人，而恰恰是近代史上放眼看世界的先驱。
    大一统有利于经济文化的发展
    廖伟章
    《河殇》第五集说：“大一统的幽灵似乎还在中国的大地上游荡”，称这是“古老的社会顽症”。这是毫无道理的。
    “大一统”，意思是统一全境。中国是多民族的国家，版图辽阔。大一统，天下太平，繁荣昌盛，是各族人民的共同愿望。大一统的形成，有力地促进了经济发展，创造了灿烂的文明，形成了优良的民族传统。
    纵观中国历史，全国统一时期，总是经济发达、文化昌明时期。反之，国家分裂，军阀割据，外族入侵，连年混战，都使生民涂炭，给社会造成极大的破坏。三国、西晋十六国、五代十国就是。在中国漫长的封建社会中，杰出政治家如汉武帝、唐太宗、清康熙等，在维护国家统一、领土完整方面都做出了杰出贡献，受到赞扬，而卖国求荣的人和搞分裂的人，都为中国人民所不齿。这不是没有道理的。
    地中海周围都是欧洲人吗？
    晓流
    《河殇》为了鼓吹欧美的先进开放，讽喻中国的落后保守，在其第二集中说道：“中国人既不像欧洲民族那样生活在地中海周围，也不像美国人那样住在两个大洋之间。”这段话有致命的错误，它把地中海周围的人都说成是“欧洲民族”。
    稍有地理常识的人都会知道：“欧洲民族”生活在地中海北岸。地中海南岸有土耳其、叙利亚、黎巴嫩等亚洲国家，有埃及、利比亚、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥等非洲国家。
    中国位于太平洋西岸，有谁说过“中国人生活在太平洋周围”这样的话呢？
    柏拉图与齐宣王何曾同时
    黄少明
    《河殇》第三集中有这样一段话：“当齐宣王创办稷下书院，汇集各派学者的同时，柏拉图也在地中海的雅典办了一个学院，亚里士多德就在那里学习。”这是对历史随意涂改。
    柏拉图创办学院在公元前387年，比齐宣王登位的时间（公元前319年）早68年。齐宣王继位时，柏拉图早已不在人间（其卒年为公元前347年），就是他的学生亚里士多德，也已去世（公元前322年）3年。硬说稷下书院和柏拉图学院创办于同一时间，岂不谬哉？
    诸葛亮长眠何处？
    巩华
    为了说明中国的传统文化轻视知识和知识分子，《河殇》以南阳为例。说南阳这块土地上“长眠着三位彪炳史册的杰出人物。他们身后的待遇却是那样悬殊，在中国历史给予这三个人的尊崇和冷漠之间，仿佛就把历史的奥秘展示给我们了。”《河殇》指的三位杰出人物是大科学家张衡，医圣张仲景，蜀汉丞相诸葛亮。
    这是信口雌黄。
    读过三国历史的人都知道，建兴十二年（公元234年），诸葛亮率大军出祁山斜谷，陈兵五丈原与司马懿对峙，百日后身患重病死在军中。按其遗命，遗体葬在定军山，即今陕西省汉中附近的勉县东南。诸葛亮何曾“长眠”在南阳？
    诸葛亮死后，蜀地百姓纷纷野祭。经刘禅同意，在沔阳修了一座祠堂，供百姓凭吊。
    诸葛亮是大政治家，也是大知识分子。他写的《出师表》，至今读来还感人肺腑。相传是他发明的“木牛流马”——鸡公车，至今还是四川乡间小路上的运输工具。诸葛亮是智慧的化身，历代人民崇敬他，正是尊重知识和知识分子的表现。
    祖冲之和宋应星并非布衣平民
    张树桐　老媪
    《河殇》有这么一句话：“有谁见过一生布衣的大科学家祖冲之和宋应星的墓冢吗？”把祖冲之和宋应星说成是一辈子没有作过官的布衣平民，纯属信口开河。
    《南史》卷七十二中，有祖冲之传。其中写道：“祖冲之字文远，范阳遒人。曾祖台之，晋侍中。祖昌，宋大匠卿。父朔之，奉朝请”。由此可知，祖冲之是生在一个官宦之家。“冲之稽古，有机思，宋孝武使直华林学省，赐宅宇车服。”由此可知，刘宋的孝武帝对祖冲之是很器重的。《祖冲之传》接着说，祖冲之开始作官，是“南徐州从事，公府参军”。以后“历位为娄县令，谒者仆射”。这时，他作出了失传的指南车。文惠太子看到他的历法，启奏武帝施行，后因文惠太子薨而未施行。后来，祖冲之又“转长水校尉，领本职”。“建武中，明帝欲使冲之巡行四方，兴造大业，可以利百姓者。会连有军事，事竟不行。”
    宋应星是我国明末著名科学家。《中国古代科学家》一书中记载说：“宋应星字长庚，江西省奉新县北乡人，万历中叶（大约公元1597年）出生于一个官僚地主家庭。万历43年（公元1615年）宋应星和其兄宋应升参加省城南昌乡试，同时中了举人。宋应星名列第三，其兄名列第六……宋应星在崇祯7年（公元1643年）任江西分宜县教谕，10年（公元1637年）刊行《天工开物》，11年（公元1638年）任福建汀州府推官，14年（公元1641年）改任安徽亳州知州，直到崇祯末年（公元1644年）才又回江西故乡，大约卒于清顺治年间。”
    由此可见，祖冲之和宋应星都不是“一生布衣”。
    《几何原本》翻译何以中断
    黄少朋
    《河殇》中说：“利玛窦从西方带来十五卷本《几何原本》同徐光启合译了前六卷，明朝一亡，翻译中断了整整二百年……中国文明的新因素幼苗，就这样不断地在周期性大动乱中夭折。”这是违反历史事实的。
    意大利天主教传教士利玛窦，1582年来到中国，1606年开始和徐光启合作翻译十五卷本的《几何原本》，1607年译完该书的前六卷。此时，利玛窦要求停止翻译，建议“先传此使同志看习之，果以用也，而后徐计其余”。不久，利玛窦病逝。二十余年后，即1633年，徐光启也跟着去世。两位翻译者都不在人世间了，《几何原本》的翻译也就自然中断。
    明朝亡于1644年，和利玛窦病逝相距34年，和徐光启去世也相距11年。《几何原本》的翻译中断，与明朝灭亡有什么大关系呢？
    清末数学家李善兰和英国人伟烈亚力合译的《几何原本》的后九卷，出版时间是1857年，与前六卷相隔二百五十年，不是《河殇》所说的“整整二百年”。
    郑和下西洋是“政治游行”吗？
    包纯
    《河殇》作者说，郑和下西洋“是一次几乎纯而又纯的政治游行”，“竟是所谓‘正其谊而不谋其利’的谦谦君子”。
    事实并非如此。据《明史》载：“成祖疑惠帝亡海外，欲踪迹之，且欲耀兵异域，示中国富强。”这里明明有两个目的：一是追踪逃亡的惠帝，二是耀兵异域。
    郑和下西洋途中，在阿拉伯半岛的阿丹（今亚丁），进行过珍宝交易。在旧港因其酋长陈祖义想进犯船队，被生擒带回朝“戮于都市”。在锡兰，国王亚烈苦奈儿诱郑和至国中，索金币，发兵劫船队，被郑和识破诡计，率两千余人攻破其城，生擒亚烈苦奈儿及其妻子官属。在苏门答剌，其前伪王子苏干剌也发兵袭击船队，郑和力战败敌，追至喃渤利，将苏擒获。
    郑和下西洋不仅“耀兵异域”，同时也是执行明成祖时的对外开放政策，加强了中国与亚非各国人民的经济文化交流。其结果：一方面刺激了当时国内商品生产的增长，如丝织业、陶瓷业等；另一方面也使亚非各地的药材、香料、西洋布等传到中国。
    跟随郑和一同出使的马欢、费信、巩珍等人，根据亲身经历和所见所闻分别撰写了《瀛涯胜览》、《星槎胜览》、《西洋蕃国志》等书，为后人研究这些地区的历史、地理，提供了极其珍贵的资料。
    所以说，郑和下西洋并不是“纯而又纯的政治游行”，也不是充当什么“不谋其利”的“谦谦君子”。
    奇怪的类比
    孙参
    为了证明“16、17这两个世纪的确是令中国人十分心酸的二百年”，《河殇》的作者们搞了两项别出心裁的类比：第一，“当王阳明在那里静坐格竹子的时候，达·芬奇一面解剖尸体一面画着蒙娜丽莎，麦哲伦完成了他最早的环球航行，哥白尼也在准备发表《天体运行论》”；第二，“当顾炎武醉心于订正古字音的时候，伽俐略发明了望远镜，哈维出版了论血液循环的巨著，而牛顿创立了微积分”。结论是：“西方人研究星辰、人体、杠杆和化学物质，中国人则研究书本、文字和故纸堆。”
    离奇之一，是硬把不可类比的人和事拉到了一起。王阳明是哲学家，顾炎武是思想家，他们的本职工作，属于当今所谓社会科学的范畴，怎么能强人所难，将其与西方的自然科学家、医学家、航海家相比呢？事实上，就在当时，李时珍正完成他190万字的巨著《本草纲目》，徐光启正翻译《几何原本》，编著《农政全书》，宋应星正撰写古代科学技术名著《天工开物》，徐霞客正在进行科学考察……这些人的成就不应该避而不提吧？
    离奇之二，是攻其一点，不及其余。以顾炎武为例，少年时即参加反宦官权贵斗争；清兵南下，又投身家乡人民抗清起义。他学问之博，成果之丰，可谓名噪一时，在国家典制、郡邑掌故、天文仪象、兵农以及经史百家、音韵训诂等方面，都有精深的研究和独到的贡献。试问，对于这样一位出类拔萃的学者，怎么能够以他曾经做过“订正古字音”的事，就拉出来为中国近代科技落后的罪责陪绑呢？
    岂能把电影情节当作历史事实
    巩华
    根据历史事件创作的电影并不等于历史事件本身。可是《河殇》在谈到甲午战争这段历史时，引用的却是电影中的情节而不是史实。请看：“甲午海战失败的最直接的原因，竟是由于一个腐败的承包商在许多炮弹里灌了泥沙。成半月形展开的中国舰队，临战了还不知到底应该听从谁的指挥……”
    1894年9月17日上午黄海海面一战，是海军提督丁汝昌指挥的。不幸他一开始便身受重伤，只得由管带刘步蟾指挥。刘指挥定远号猛冲，击毁一艘敌舰，又击中日本海军军令部长乘坐的军舰。靖远舰管带叶祖珪见定远舰桅楼折断，便主动代旗舰升旗指挥。因此，这次海战不是“临战了还不知到底应该听从谁的指挥”。
    “海权导致民主革命”质疑
    黄少明
    《河殇》第六集说：“海权导致了民主革命”，“近代西方资产阶级革命的社会前提，也正是欧洲海外航线的开辟。”
    如果这些论断能够成立，民主革命就应该首先从15、16世纪航海业最发达的国家葡萄牙和西班牙开始。然而正如大家所知道的，事实却恰恰相反，这两个国家的资产阶级民主革命，在欧洲是比较晚的。
    严复何曾与伊藤博文同学郭学棣
    《河殇》第六集说，中国近代的伟大启蒙者严复“最终退到孔孟之道的怀抱里的时候，他在英国海军大学的同学伊藤博文，却连任日本首相，率领这个岛国迅速跨进世界强国之林”。
    这段话有两大错。
    据史料载，伊藤博文1863年曾到英国学习过海军技术，历时仅半年。当时严复只有9岁。1868年日本明治维新后，伊藤出任兵库县知事，1877年因在平息西乡隆盛发动的鹿儿岛叛乱中立功，被授予旭日大绶章，1878年被委任为内务卿。而严复是1877年至1879年在英国格林尼次海军大学学习的。怎么可能与伊藤博文同学？
    19世纪70年代在英国海军大学学习过海军建设的是东乡平八郎。此人后来担任日本“浪速”号舰长，在中日甲午战争中很卖力气，以后一直升任到日本海军大将、元帅。若说严复与东乡是“同学”，可能多少还沾点边儿（东乡是1871年赴英国的，比严复早6年）。
    严复1879年从英国学习海军回来后，执教于天津北洋水师学堂近20年，一直鼓吹维新思想。戊戌变法失败后的10多年间，严复致力于系统介绍和传播西方资本主义文化。其“最终退到孔孟之道的怀抱”，是在1911年辛亥革命之后。而早在1906年，伊藤博文已在我国东北哈尔滨车站被朝鲜爱国志士刺杀。
