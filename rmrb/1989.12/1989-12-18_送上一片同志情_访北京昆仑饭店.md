In the northeastern suburbs of Beijing, along the Liangma River, stands a four-star luxury hotel designed and built by China itself—the Kunlun Hotel, a Sino-foreign joint venture. The hotel is managed by employees of the Shanghai Jinjiang (Group) Joint Venture Company.

Every corner of the hotel echoes with warm greetings, and everywhere you receive courteous service. The place is filled with the warmth of Eastern hospitality.

On the morning of November 25, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Kunlun Hotel's opening, a reporter from this newspaper visited the hotel. Unexpectedly, the managers of various departments were all absent. To welcome the anniversary, they were all working in the staff cafeteria, serving the waitstaff.

After lunch, waitstaff Liu Lanfu from the accommodation department described to the reporter, “As soon as you enter the dining hall, the general manager is waiting at the door and says, ‘Hello! You’ve worked hard this year!’ Then the other managers bring in hot dishes, hot rice, and hot soup, making one feel warm and sweet inside.” Waitstaff Niu Guozeng from the general affairs department said, “Today’s lunch, though not a grand feast, was the best we’ve had. Celebrating the anniversary this way is very meaningful. It makes us feel the comradely love and realize that the general manager and the waitstaff are all masters of the Kunlun Hotel.”

After working continuously for three hours, the young general manager and Communist Party member Yang Yuanping told me: Managing business and ideological work should be like our chefs kneading dough with water—well mixed, so that the dough and water blend together, making the dough soft and just right, and the resulting food tasty. The guests are the top priority; without guests, there would be no Kunlun Hotel. However, the service staff working on the front lines are also very important. Without them, there would be no us, no front line, and no backstage support for the Kunlun Hotel. Therefore, we demand that the front-line staff serve the guests with high quality, while we demand that the leaders at all levels work hard to serve the front line. When they return to the backstage, we offer them a slice of comradely love.

In the basement of the Kunlun Hotel, there is a small staff barbershop. The five barbers know every job and hairstyle preference of the staff. As soon as they see someone coming in for a haircut, they first offer a cup of hot tea, then a fragrant towel, and finally give a neat and tidy haircut. The staff bathhouse, in addition to having a good environment, the bathhouse staff also proactively polish the shoes of the front-line staff.

Comradely love permeates the air here. People are all made of flesh and blood, and we should treat others as we would like to be treated. When they return to the front line to work, how can they not serve the guests wholeheartedly?

Once, a foreign guest suddenly fell ill, and waitstaff Yang Jingshan helped him find a doctor. Since the medical equipment lacked a stand, little Yang simply picked up the equipment and let the doctor examine and treat the patient. After 20 minutes, little Yang was covered in sweat, but in his mind, he was still serving the guests.

Another time, lobby cleaner Li Sumin saw a Japanese female guest enter the restroom and not come out for 20 minutes. She immediately went in and found the guest had fainted. Li Sumin called for help, had the guest moved to a safe place, washed the dirty clothes, and sent them to the guest room, making the Japanese guest very moved. Upon leaving, she wrote to the general manager, praising, “Your enthusiastic and thoughtful service is not only top-notch in China but also in the world.”

Among taxi drivers, there is a widely circulated saying: “To eat a cheap and delicious hot lunch, hurry up and drive to Kunlun.” It turns out that the Kunlun Hotel not only cares about the lives of its own staff but also thinks that taxi drivers are hardworking. Although they are not “Kunlun” people, they should also be offered a slice of comradely love. Thus, every day at noon, hot meals are prepared for the drivers, each meal costing only 2 yuan, and the service staff also wipe the cars and empty the ashtrays for free. These small acts of kindness are remembered by the drivers, who naturally often bring scattered tourists to stay at the Kunlun Hotel and happily say: Although we are not Kunlun people, we are also willing to do our part for Kunlun.

The leaders genuinely serve the staff, bringing vitality to the hotel. This year, from January to May, the business revenue increased by 36% compared to the same period last year. Although June was affected by the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, starting from July, the room occupancy rate quickly rebounded. In September, it reached 80%, and in October, it peaked at over 95%, with some days having to send guests who couldn’t be accommodated to other hotels.

    送上一片同志情
    ——访北京昆仑饭店
    本报记者　徐建中
    在北京东北郊亮马河畔，有一座我国自行设计、自己建造的四星级中外合资豪华饭店——昆仑饭店。管理这座饭店的是上海锦江（集团）联营公司的员工。
    在饭店的每个角落都能听到热情的“问好”声，处处受到彬彬有礼的接待，这里充满了东方人情味。
    11月25日上午，正值昆仑饭店开业一周年之际，记者来到昆仑饭店采访，不料，各部门的管理干部都不在。为了迎接店庆，他们都在职工食堂参加劳动，为服务员服务。
    午餐后，客房部的服务员刘兰甫对记者描述说：“一进餐厅，总经理在门口恭候，他说：‘您好！一年中辛苦了！’接着其他经理端来热菜热饭热汤，使人心里顿时感到热乎乎、甜滋滋的。”综合部的服务员牛国增说：“今天的午餐，虽没有大摆宴席，却享受得最好。这样庆祝店庆，很有意义，它使我们享受到同志情谊，认识到总经理和服务员都是昆仑饭店的主人。”
    连续劳动三个小时之后，年轻的总经理、共产党员杨原平告诉我：抓业务建设和抓思想工作要像我们的厨师们和面加水一样，要很好地揉在一起，使面水相融，这样才能拌得均匀，软硬得当，做出来的面食才能适口。顾客是第一位的，没有顾客就没有昆仑饭店的存在。但是，工作在第一线的服务人员也非常重要，没有他们也就没有我们，没有前台就没有后台，就没有昆仑饭店的一切。所以我们一方面要求前台人员优质为宾客服务，同时我们要求各级领导努力为前台服务。当他们回到后台，送上一片同志情。
    昆仑饭店地下室有一个小小职工理发室，五名理发师对全店员工从事的工作和发型爱好都了如指掌。他们一见来理发的先端上一杯热茶，再送上一块香巾，然后理得漂漂亮亮的。职工浴室除有比较好的环境外，澡堂员工还主动为前台员工擦拭皮鞋。
    这里洋溢着同志情谊。人心都是肉长的，将心比心，当他返回第一线去工作时还有什么理由不专心一意地为宾客服务呢？
    一位外国客人因突发病，服务员杨京山帮他找医生，因医疗设备没有支架，小杨干脆就抱起医疗设备让医生检查治疗，20分钟下来，小杨已汗流满面，但是他心目中所想的是我仍然在为宾客服务。
    还有一次，大堂清洁员李素敏看到一位日本女宾客走进厕所后，20分钟没有出来，她立即进去，发现客人已经昏倒在地。李素敏找来伙伴把客人安置好，又将脏衣服洗干净送到客房，使这位日本客人非常感动，离别时她给总经理写信称赞说：“你们这种热忱周到的服务，不仅仅是在中国，在世界上也是一流的。”
    在出租汽车的司机中广为流传着这么一句话：“要吃价廉物美的热午餐，赶快开车去昆仑。”原来，昆仑饭店不仅仅只是关心本店员工的生活，在他们看来，出租车的司机也够辛苦的，他们虽不是“昆仑”人，同样也应送上一片同志情。于是，每天中午都为司机准备了热菜热饭，每份只收二元钱，服务人员还免费为出租车擦车、倒烟灰缸。这些区区小事，司机们却铭记在心中了，他们很自然地经常把一些零散旅游客人拉到昆仑饭店来住宿，并高兴地说：我们虽然不是昆仑人，也愿为昆仑出把力。
    领导真心实意地为职工服务，给饭店带来了活力。今年1至5月的营业额与去年同期相比增加36％，6月份虽受到动乱和反革命暴乱的影响，但从7月份开始，客房出租率回升很快，回头客很多，9月份达到80％，10月份高峰时竟达到95％以上，有几天不得不把住不下的客人送到其他饭店去。（附图片）
