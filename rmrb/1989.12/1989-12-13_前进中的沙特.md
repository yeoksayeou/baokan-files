Over the past half-century, Saudi Arabia has made rapid progress in the fields of economy and culture, transforming its 2.25 million square kilometers of land into a vibrant and dynamic region, shedding its former image of poverty and backwardness.

It has been confirmed that Saudi Arabia's oil reserves account for one-quarter of the world's total. This abundant oil resource has provided the country, with a population of only 12 million, with favorable conditions for economic development.

The days of trading by camel and donkey have long passed. Today, Saudi Arabia boasts a network of highways, secondary roads, and rural roads totaling over 100,000 kilometers, with air and sea transportation also well-developed. In the past, Saudi Arabia suffered from a lack of medical facilities and the spread of diseases. Today, the country has built numerous hospitals and clinics, with a total of 26,000 beds and over 6,000 doctors.

Previously, the Saudi people relied on fishing, shrimp harvesting, and pearl diving for a living, leading to a life of poverty and hardship. Now, the country has established over 2,000 factories producing a variety of products. The largest industry is seawater desalination, producing 503 million gallons of fresh water daily, earning Saudi Arabia the title of the world's leading seawater desalination country.

With economic development, various sectors such as culture, sports, education, and science have also flourished. Seven years ago, Saudi Arabia had virtually no agriculture, with almost all grain imported. Today, it is not only the "Kingdom of Oil" but also the "Kingdom of Wheat," exporting wheat to 45 countries and ranking sixth in the world in both production and export. Seven years ago, Saudi Arabia's wheat cultivation was still in the experimental stage, with an annual production of less than 300,000 tons. However, in 1988, Saudi Arabia's wheat cultivation area reached 2.3 million hectares, with production soaring to 3.4 million tons, not only meeting the country's demand for wheat and wheat products but also exporting to Gulf countries, other Arab nations, and European countries.

As is well known, the first-largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia, is covered with deserts, with the Rub' al Khali being the most prominent. There, winters are short and summers are long, with intense heat and little rain. Vegetation is scarce, except for the date palm trees, known as the "princess of the fields," which stand tall against the sandstorms. However, if you visit Saudi Arabia today, you will find that even the latest maps of the country need to be updated. Because, on millions of hectares of land, you will no longer see the scenes of rolling sands and flying dust. Instead, you will see the waves of wheat fields swaying in the wind across more than 8,500 farms.

Developing agriculture in Saudi Arabia is no easy task. Water is the lifeblood of agriculture, yet water is extremely precious in Saudi Arabia. Currently, Saudi agriculture mainly relies on two sources: capturing seasonal mountain floods and desalinating seawater. In 1975, Saudi Arabia had 16 small reservoirs, but now it has built 200 large, medium, and small reservoirs, 12.4 times more than before, providing a large amount of water for agricultural development. However, the Saudi people deeply understand the importance of water conservation and have adopted axial irrigation methods and other water-saving technologies.

In addition to wheat, Saudi Arabia has also vigorously promoted the cultivation of barley, corn, fava beans, dates, fruits, vegetables, and alfalfa for feed, as well as the raising of broiler chickens, laying hens, and dairy cows. According to incomplete statistics, Saudi Arabia currently has nearly 100 poultry farms, producing 120,000 tons of broiler chickens and 110,000 tons of fresh eggs annually. There are also 267 fishing boats producing 37,000 tons of fresh fish annually. Additionally, 500,000 tons of dates, 72 million liters of fresh milk, and 18,263 boxes of honey and other fruits are produced annually. Currently, broiler chickens, fresh eggs, and dates are all self-sufficient and exported to neighboring countries. Therefore, "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has turned its land into the breadbasket of the Gulf countries."

The significant development of Saudi Arabia's agriculture and sideline industries is inseparable from the government's policies of encouraging and supporting agriculture. Saudi Arabia's agricultural policies are divided into several specific policies, such as land and water resource policies, talent development policies, and diversified operation policies.

On the other hand, the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank has 70 branches covering the entire country, providing interest-free loans or assistance to farmers.

Now, they use advanced and scientific field management methods, establishing a one-stop production system from cultivation, field management, transportation, storage, processing, and forage production.

Government support is also evident in the government purchasing wheat from farms at a price five times higher than the world market price and spending billions of dollars annually to purchase agricultural tools, irrigation equipment, and build grain silos. It is because of this that Saudi Arabia has been able to catch up with the world's rapidly developing agricultural countries and turn vast deserts into green fields.

    前进中的沙特
    李光斌
    半个多世纪以来，沙特阿拉伯在经济、文化等方面发展迅速，使得225万平方公里的土地上呈现活力和生机，改变了昔日贫困落后的面貌。
    现已查明，沙特的石油储量占全世界石油储量的1／4。得天独厚的石油资源给这个只有1200万人口的国家提供了发展经济的有利条件。
    乘驼骑驴经商的年代已经一去不复返了。现在沙特全国有高速公路、二级公路和乡间公路共10万多公里，空中、海上交通也四通八达。昔日，沙特缺医少药，疾病流行。而今，全国建成了大批医院和医务站，共有床位2.6万张，医生6000多名。
    从前，沙特人民靠打渔捞虾摸珍珠过日子，生活贫困，衣食无着。现在全国建成2000多家工厂，制造各种产品。最大的工业是海水淡化工业，日产5.03亿加仑淡水，被誉为世界第一海水淡化工业国。
    随着经济的发展，文化、体育、教育、科学等各项事业也日益发达。7年前，沙特无农业可谈，粮食几乎全靠进口。如今，它不仅是“石油王国”，而且是向45个国家出口小麦的“小麦王国”，其产量与出口量已经一跃而居世界第六位。7年前，沙特的小麦种植还处在试验阶段，年产量不足30万吨。但是，1988年沙特的小麦种植面积已达230万公顷，产量猛增至340万吨，不仅满足了本国对小麦和小麦产品的需要，而且向海湾各国、其他阿拉伯国家以及欧洲国家出口。
    众所周知，西亚半岛的第一大国沙特境内到处是沙漠，尤以鲁卜哈利为最。在那里冬短夏长，炎热少雨。植被系数很小，只有被誉为“田间公主”的枣椰树不畏沙暴岿然挺立在大地上。然而今日如果你到沙特一游，你将发现连最新出版的沙特地图也需要修改。因为，在几百万公顷的土地上再也看不到黄沙滚滚、飞沙走石的情景。展现在你面前的是8500多个农场的麦浪随风摇曳。
    在沙特发展农业谈何容易。水是农业的命脉，然而，水在沙特却是极宝贵的。目前，沙特农业还主要靠截储雨季山洪和淡化海水两条腿走路。1975年，沙特有小型水库16座，现在已修成大中小型水库200座，是原来的12.4倍，为农业发展提供了大量用水。但是，沙特人民深深懂得节约用水的意义，他们采用了轴式灌溉方式和其他节约用水的新技术。
    除种植小麦外，沙特还大力种植大麦、玉米、蚕豆、椰枣、水果、蔬菜、饲料用的苜蓿，饲养肉鸡、蛋鸡、种奶牛等。据不完全统计，沙特现有近百个养鸡场，年产肉鸡12万吨，鲜蛋11万吨，267艘渔船，年产鲜鱼3.7万吨，此外还年产50万吨椰枣、7200万升鲜奶以及18263箱蜂蜜和其他水果。目前，肉鸡、鲜蛋和椰枣均已自给有余并向邻国出口。因此，“沙特阿拉伯王国已使它的土地成为海湾各国的面包篮”。
    沙特阿拉伯农副业得到长足的发展是与政府鼓励与支持农业的政策分不开的。沙特的农业政策分成若干具体的政策，如土地与水源政策，人才开发政策，多种经营政策等。
    另一方面，沙特阿拉伯农业银行有70个分行，遍布沙特全境，向农场主提供无息贷款或援助。
    现在，他们采用先进的、科学的田间管理方法，建立起从耕种、田间管理、运输、储藏、加工、牧草生产一条龙的生产制度。
    国家的支持还表现在政府以高于世界市场小麦价格5倍的价钱收购农场的小麦，并每年支付数亿美元购买农具、灌溉设备和修建粮仓，正因为如此，沙特才能追上世界高速发展农业的国家，并使大片沙漠披上绿装。
