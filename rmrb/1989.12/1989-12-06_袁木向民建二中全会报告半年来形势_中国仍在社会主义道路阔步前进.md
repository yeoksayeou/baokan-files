Clam Wood Reports on the Situation Over the Past Half-Year to the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association
China Continues to Advance on the Socialist Path

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th - Today, Clam Wood, Director of the State Council Research Office, reported at the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth National Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association that in the six months since the suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, China, led by the Communist Party of China with a population of 1.1 billion, continues to stand tall in the East, advancing on the socialist path. China also presents a vibrant image of reform and opening up to the world.

Clam Wood said in his report on correctly understanding the situation and deeply grasping the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Our party, leading the people of the entire country, has properly handled this heart-wrenching and serious political struggle of turmoil and rebellion. Just a few months later, the situation has developed in a way that has greatly exceeded many people's expectations, with national order quickly returning to normal, policies stabilizing, the political situation stabilizing, public sentiment stabilizing, and the economy continuing to develop during the rectification and adjustment."

Why has the situation developed in such a relatively satisfactory way over the past six months? Clam Wood believes there are several reasons:

	— The leadership of the Party and the socialist path have taken deep root in the vast land of China, which is an irresistible historical trend. Anyone who tries to obstruct this trend is doomed to fail.
	— Socialist China has been forged through decades of revolutionary war, during which a military force with a glorious revolutionary tradition and loyalty to the Party and the people has been tempered. This is the fundamental guarantee of the socialist system.
	— Our Party is strong and united, and has stood the test of time. After this turmoil, it has become even more mature. In the face of various adverse currents, our Party has not lost its principles and has taken a serious Marxist attitude towards the occurrence and development of the turmoil and rebellion.
	— The new central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, established by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, has been working hard to shape its image among the people through its actions and has gained increasing support and trust from the people.

Clam Wood said that to ensure the long-term stability and prosperity of the country, to ensure the smooth implementation of the rectification and adjustment, reform and opening up, to maintain a stable and united political situation, and to achieve stable economic development, we must fully and resolutely implement the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points" in all future work. We must insist on reform and opening up under the premise of adhering to the socialist direction. We must genuinely solve various practical problems that the people urgently hope to address. We must do everything possible to ensure the stability and continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies.

Clam Wood emphasized that the practice of the past few months has proven that under the leadership of the new central leadership of the Party, since we have the ability and means to suppress the turmoil and rebellion and overcome the enormous difficulties brought about by the turmoil and rebellion, we will definitely have the ability and means to achieve further victories in rectification and adjustment and deepening reform.

Chairman Sun Qimeng of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chairman Sun Xiaocun of the Consultative Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the vice-chairmen of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association attended the report meeting.

    袁木向民建二中全会报告半年来形势
    中国仍在社会主义道路阔步前进
    新华社北京12月5日电　国务院研究室主任袁木今天上午在中国民主建国会五届二中全会上说，制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱后的6个月来，中国共产党领导的拥有11亿人口的中国，仍然以在社会主义道路上阔步前进的面貌屹立在世界的东方，仍然以改革开放、蓬勃向上的形象展现在世界人民的面前。
    袁木在关于正确认识形势、深刻领会中共十三届五中全会精神的报告中说，我们党领导全国人民妥善地处理了动乱、暴乱这场惊心动魄的严重政治斗争，仅仅过了几个月就出现了全国秩序迅速恢复正常，政策稳定、政局稳定、人心稳定、经济也在治理整顿中继续发展的局面。形势的发展大大出乎许多人的预料。
    6个月来形势的发展为什么会出现目前这样比较令人满意的状况？袁木认为有以下几条：
    ——党的领导、社会主义道路在中国辽阔的大地上深入人心，这是不可阻挡的历史潮流，谁想阻挡这个潮流是注定要失败的。
    ——社会主义中国是经过几十年革命战争打出来的，在战争中锻炼出了一支有着光荣革命传统，忠于党、忠于人民的军队，这是社会主义制度的根本保证。
    ——我们党是坚强的、团结的，是经得起考验的，经过这次风波比过去更加成熟；在形形色色的逆流面前，我们党没有丧失原则，并且对动乱、暴乱的发生、发展采取了深刻反思的郑重的马克思主义态度。
    ——党的十三届四中全会确立的以江泽民同志为核心的新的中央领导集体努力以自己的行动，在人民中塑造自己的形象，越来越多地得到人民的支持和信任。
    袁木说，要保证国家的长治久安，保证治理整顿、改革开放的顺利进行，继续保持安定团结的政治局面和实现经济的稳定发展，在今后的各项工作中，我们必须全面地、坚决地贯彻党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线；要在坚持社会主义方向的前提下，坚持改革开放；要切实解决人民群众迫切希望解决的各种实际问题；要千方百计保证党的路线、方针、政策的稳定性和连续性。
    袁木强调说，过去几个月的实践证明，在党中央新的领导集体带领下，我们既然有能力有办法平息动乱和暴乱，克服由于动乱和暴乱给我们带来的巨大困难，我们也就一定有能力有办法取得进一步治理整顿和深化改革的胜利。
    民建中央主席孙起孟、民建中央咨议委员会主任孙晓村和民建中央的各位副主席，出席了报告会。
