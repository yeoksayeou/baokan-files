A working group of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) held meetings yesterday and today here to continue discussing the restoration of China's contracting party status in GATT.

The Chinese delegation, led by Vice Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Shen Jueren, reiterated at the meeting that China hopes to rejoin GATT as soon as possible and fully participate in the multilateral trading system.

In his speech, Shen Jueren pointed out that the early restoration of China's contracting party status will contribute to consolidating the multilateral trading system, promoting the development of world economic and trade, and will also be beneficial to furthering China's reform and opening up and expanding economic and trade exchanges with other countries.

This meeting is the 8th held by the GATT China Working Group since its establishment in 1987.

The next meeting of the GATT China Working Group will be held next spring.
