Philippine Defense Minister Ramos said today that government forces are continuing to firmly control the situation in Manila. The government army and police are intensifying efforts to eliminate the remnants of the December 1 coup.

The statement said that troops from the north and south of Manila have rushed to reinforce other units to crush the rebels.

In the commercial district of Makati, the situation remains tense. Some roads are blocked, and gunshots can occasionally be heard. Government forces are clearing out the remaining pockets of resistance.

However, life in Manila is gradually returning to normal. It is reported that government employees have started going to work, banks, shops, and some basic services have resumed operations, and thousands of displaced residents are gradually returning home.

Currently, commercial flights at Manila Airport have not yet resumed. Two Philippine Airlines flights from the United States to Manila remain stranded in Cebu, the second-largest city in the Philippines.

    政府军牢牢控制局势
    新华社马尼拉12月4日电  菲律宾国防部长拉莫斯今天在此间发表的声明说，政府军正在继续牢牢地控制着马尼拉的局势。政府军与警察加紧肃清12月1日政变的残余分子。
    声明说，在马尼拉北面和南面的部队已赶来增援，配合其它部队粉碎叛军。
    在马尼拉商业区马卡蒂，局势仍然紧张。一些道路被封锁，时而听到枪声，政府军正在肃清零星残敌。
    但是，马尼拉市的生活已慢慢恢复正常。据报道，政府工作人员开始上班，银行、商店和一些基本服务设施恢复营业，数以千计的逃难市民陆续回到家中。
    目前，马尼拉机场的商业飞行还没有恢复，从美国飞往马尼拉的两家菲律宾航空公司的飞机仍滞留在菲律宾第二大城市宿务。
