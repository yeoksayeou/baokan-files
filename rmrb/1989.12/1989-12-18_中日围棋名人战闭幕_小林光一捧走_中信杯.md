The second Middle East Cup Chinese-Japanese Go Championship concluded tonight at the Beijing Hotel. Attendees included Zhang Jinfu, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and advisor to the Chinese Go Association, Gao Di, president of the People's Daily, Bi Jichang, chief supervisor of the CITIC Group, Sanbara Katsunori, director of the Cultural Department of the Asahi Shimbun, and other prominent figures from the Chinese and Japanese Go communities.

The high-level match between the current Go champions of China and Japan was decided in just two games. Despite thorough preparation and his best efforts during the match, 25-year-old Ma Xiaochun was unable to prevent Kobayashi Koichi, who is at the peak of his career, from defending his title and winning the Middle East Cup. At the closing ceremony, Chen Zude, president of the Chinese Go Association, announced the results of the match. Subsequently, the organizers presented awards and souvenirs to Kobayashi Koichi and Ma Xiaochun.

Gao Di and Sanbara spoke on behalf of the Chinese and Japanese organizers, expressing their gratitude to all parties for their support of the event. They also announced that both sides had agreed to continue holding this high-level competition and decided that the third Middle East Cup Chinese-Japanese Go Championship would be held in Tokyo in December 1990.
