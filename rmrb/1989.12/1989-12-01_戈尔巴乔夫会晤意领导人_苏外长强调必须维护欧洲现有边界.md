Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 29th. Soviet leader Gorbachev, who has just arrived, held his first talks with Italian Prime Minister Andreotti this afternoon.

After the talks, Italian Foreign Minister De Michelis told reporters that both Italy and the Soviet Union have expressed a desire to discuss all issues of mutual concern, including the current situation in the two Germanys. He believes that today's talks have "set the general direction for future cooperation between Italy and the Soviet Union." During Gorbachev's private meeting with Andreotti, the two foreign ministers also held talks.

At tonight's press briefing, Soviet spokesman Grishin said that during the talks between the two foreign ministers, Shevardnadze expressed concern about German revanchism and emphasized the need to maintain existing European borders. He said that the process of European construction is "difficult and slow, and cannot skip stages. Three fundamental realities must be considered: Europe is divided into two blocs; existing borders are confirmed by the Helsinki Final Act; and there are two Germanys."

The two foreign ministers also discussed the transformations in Eastern European countries, the situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and bilateral relations.

    新华社罗马11月29日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天上午抵达罗马，开始对意大利进行首次国事访问。
    今天下午，将在总统府举行欢迎仪式，随后，戈尔巴乔夫将同总统科西加举行会谈。
    新华社罗马11月29日电　刚刚来访的苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天下午同意大利总理安德烈奥蒂举行了首次会谈。
    会谈后，意大利外长德米凯利斯对记者说，意苏双方都有愿望讨论共同关心的包括两个德国当前局势在内的所有问题。他认为，今天的会谈为意苏两国今后的合作“制定了总路线”。在戈尔巴乔夫与安德烈奥蒂举行单独会谈时，两国外长举行了会谈。
    在今晚的记者吹风会上，苏联发言人格拉西莫夫说，在两国外长举行的会谈中，谢瓦尔德纳泽表示了对德国复仇主义的担心，并强调必须维护欧洲现有边界，因为欧洲建设的“进程是困难而缓慢的，不能超越阶段。必须考虑三个基本现实：欧洲分裂为两个集团；现有边界是经赫尔辛基欧安会最后文件确认的；存在着两个德国”。
