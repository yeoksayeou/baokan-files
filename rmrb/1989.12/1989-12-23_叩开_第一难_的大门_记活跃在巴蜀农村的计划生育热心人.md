Despite not receiving any payment or holding any official position in the family planning department, the enthusiasts active in the Sichuan countryside have made the family planning work, known as the "most difficult in the world," successful and orderly.

"Adopted sons are better than biological sons"

On the farm roads of Xin Guang Village in Yan Jia Town, Zhong District, Deyang City, Sichuan Province, a 36-year-old man often rides a motorcycle from village to village. He is the famous "Orange King," Liu Zhiyi.

Liu Zhiyi's village has barren land and many people, and many villagers place their hopes for prosperity on having children.

Liu Zhiyi decided to change this. He spent his own money to invite villagers to his orchard to learn techniques. He tirelessly spread his theory: "Adopting an 'orange son' is better than having a biological son." In the countryside, farmers want more children, and one of the main reasons is to have someone to rely on in old age. Liu Zhiyi told them, "According to my cultivation techniques, each orange tree can earn over 100 yuan a year. Planting dozens of trees means you won't have to worry about the future as long as you take care of the orchard. 'Orange sons' will be more filial than your biological sons!"

Over the years, Liu Zhiyi bought more than 3,300 yuan worth of saplings for the villagers. He visited each household at least 10 times to explain the techniques. Now, Xin Guang Village, with a population of over 1,500, has an average of 35.5 orange trees per person, and the village is green all around. For the past three years, the village has had no unauthorized births or out-of-wedlock births. The per capita income has increased from 200 yuan in 1985 to 640 yuan now, and the per capita grain production has increased from 370 kilograms to over 400 kilograms.

"The Honorable Village" truly became honorable

Guangrong Village is the most populous village in Yongqing Township, Jiajiang County, located in a remote area, and the villagers have strong traditional views on childbearing.

Six years ago, Peng Shufang retired and returned to the village to become the village women's director, taking the initiative to manage family planning. She worked tirelessly, traveling through mountains and rivers, and registering all married women of childbearing age in the village, creating six ledgers, and focusing on door-to-door work.

There was a woman in the village named Wang Fuzhi who did not take contraceptive measures after giving birth. Village and township cadres had tried many times to persuade her, but to no avail. Peng Shufang visited her several times and was rebuffed. But Peng did not give up; she found ways to approach her, accompanying her to the market, and eventually, they became good friends who shared everything. It turned out that Wang did not want to have an IUD because she had cervical erosion and was ashamed to talk about it. Peng Shufang helped her seek medical treatment. Now, Wang Fuzhi not only cured her disease but also voluntarily implemented contraceptive measures.

Everyone in the village knows that Peng Shufang's heart is only for family planning work, except for herself. Once, she endured the pain of arthritis and braved heavy rain to help a villager, Ma Guifang, send her critically ill only child to the county hospital 20 li away. When the county hospital was not enough, she sent her to the Leshan City Hospital. After several days of hard work, she also fell ill.

Now, the once-troublesome Guangrong Village has had no unauthorized births for six consecutive years, and 100% of married women of childbearing age have implemented contraceptive measures. Guangrong Village has become an advanced family planning village and is truly honorable.

How Liu Yuan handles the hard task

Liu Yuan is the principal of the Central School in Tiecun Township, Nanchuan County. Since May 1985, he has used his family's five rooms, about 100 square meters, in his hometown of Nongxing Village, Third Group, as a cultural activity venue, and invests a certain amount of money each year to open a reading room, a knowledge supplement room, a TV room, a game room, a ping-pong room, and a basketball court. He also subscribes to more than 10 newspapers, magazines, and books, providing cultural and entertainment venues for the villagers free of charge. Under Liu Yuan's influence, such cultural households in the rural areas of Nanchuan County have developed to more than 340, forming a new pattern of rural culture in the county.

In Liu Yuan's home, there are four service items for couples of childbearing age: first, organizing and contacting couples of childbearing age to learn about family planning policies, laws and regulations, cultural and scientific knowledge, and knowledge of birth control and family planning. Second, mobilizing the women of childbearing age in the households he contacts to have no unauthorized pregnancies, no late-term abortions, no unauthorized births, and no cohabitation outside of marriage. Third, assisting the village and group in conducting bimonthly pregnancy checks for married women of childbearing age, monthly five-visits and five-questions, and rotating household heads for duty. Fourth, leading couples of childbearing age in scientific farming and taking the path of hard work to prosperity. Over the years, Liu Yuan's wife, Li Keying, has contacted 13 households of married couples of childbearing age, all of whom have implemented these four measures.

Liu Yuan believes that the "hard task" of family planning should be "soft-landed." Only by gradually changing the cultural atmosphere of the mountainous rural areas can farmers broaden their horizons and break away from the old childbearing cycle. Liu Yuan's hometown has maintained seven consecutive years of no unauthorized births since 1982.

    叩开“第一难”的大门
    ——记活跃在巴蜀农村的计划生育热心人
    新华社记者　徐波
    既没在计划生育部门拿一分钱报酬，又没在计划生育部门获得一官半职，但活跃在巴蜀大地上的计划生育热心人，却把号称“天下第一难”的计划生育工作做得有声有色，有板有眼……
    亲儿子不如“柑儿子”
    在四川省德阳市中区鄢家镇新光村的机耕道上，一位36岁的男子时常骑着摩托车走村串户。他就是远近驰名的“柑桔大王”刘志义。
    刘志义所在的村，土地贫瘠，人多地少，很多乡亲把致富希望寄托在生儿育女上。
    刘志义决心要改变这一切，自己掏钱把乡亲们请到他的果园里来学技术。还不厌其烦地给乡亲们传播自己“带个亲儿子不如带个‘柑儿子’”的“理论”。在农村，农民想多要孩子，一个很大的原因就是为了“老有所靠”。刘志义就给大家讲：“按我的栽培技术，每株柑桔树一年收入100多元，栽几十株，今后只要看好果园就不用犯愁了，‘柑儿子’孝顺你们的心才铁啊！”
  几年来，刘志义买了3300多元的树苗给乡亲们，村里每户人家他至少上门讲解技术10次。而今，新光村1500多人，人均柑桔树35.5株，村前村后变绿了。如今这个村已三年无计划外生育和无非婚生育。人均收入从1985年的200元增加到现在的640元，人均粮食从370公斤增加到400多公斤。
    “光荣村”真正光荣了
    光荣村是夹江县永青乡人口最多的村，地处偏僻，农民旧的生育观极浓厚。
    6年前，彭淑芳退休回到村上，担任了村妇女主任，主动管起了计划生育的事情。她不辞辛劳，跋山涉水，把全村已婚育龄妇女逐一登记造册，建立了6本账，从中分出重点，挨门挨户做工作。
    村里有个汪福枝，生孩后长期不采取避孕措施，乡、村干部多次做工作都无效。彭淑芳上门几次，也碰了钉子。但老彭不灰心，想方设法接近她，上门拉家常：赶场有意识结伴同行，终于她俩成了无话不谈的好朋友。原来汪不愿安环是因为患了子宫颈糜烂羞于启齿，彭淑芳热心为她求医治病。现在，汪福枝不仅治好了病，还自觉落实了避孕措施。
    全村人都知道，彭淑芳心里只装着计划生育工作，唯独没有她自己。一次她忍着关节炎的剧痛，冒着大雨，帮村民马桂芳送病危的独生女到20里外的县医院，县医院不行又送乐山市医院，几天奔波劳累后她也大病一场。
    现在，曾是老大难的光荣村，已连续6年无计划外生育，已婚育龄妇女应落实节育措施的100％的落实了。光荣村成了计划生育先进村，真正光荣了。
    刘元怎样对待硬任务
    刘元，是南川县铁村乡中心校校长，他从1985年5月以来，在家乡农兴村三组，用自己家的五间房子约100平方米做文化活动场，并每年投入一定经费，先后开辟了图书阅览室、知识补习室、电视室、游艺室、乒乓室和篮球场，还订了《家庭与生活》、《中国人口报》等10多种报刊杂志和多种书籍，无偿地为本村农民提供文化娱乐场所。在刘元的影响下，南川县农村这样的文化户已经发展到340多家，形成了该县农村文化的新格局。
    在刘元家里就为育龄夫妇订了四条服务项目，一是组织联系户的育龄夫妇学习计划生育方针政策、法律法规，文化科学技术、优生优育避孕节育知识。二是动员所联系户的育龄妇女做到无计划外怀孕，无大月份引产，无计划外生育，无非婚同居。三是协助村、组做好已婚育龄妇女的双月孕情普查，单月的五访五问和户长轮流值班。四是带领育龄夫妇科学种田，走勤劳致富的道路。几年来，刘元爱人李科英联系的13户已婚育龄夫妇全部做到了这四条。
    刘元认为计划生育的“硬任务”，应该“软着陆”。只有逐步改变山区农村的文化氛围，才能使农民打开眼界，走出旧有的生育圈子。刘元的家乡，从1982年以来，已连续保持7年无计划外生育。
