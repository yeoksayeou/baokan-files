	Vietnam Sent 14,000 More Troops to Cambodia Last Month

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7: According to the Democratic Kampuchea Radio broadcast, the General Headquarters of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea issued a news bulletin on December 4, exposing that Vietnam sent another 14,000 troops to Cambodia in November. This move aims to strengthen the forces of the Vietnamese and Phnom Penh puppet army in Cambodia to resist the offensive of the patriotic forces of Cambodia.

	The news bulletin said that these new troops, transferred from Vietnam to the Cambodian battlefield, are all dressed in the uniforms of the Phnom Penh puppet army. In addition to sending more troops to Cambodia, the Vietnamese authorities have also been continuously transporting tanks, artillery, ammunition, and other military equipment to Cambodia to intensify the war of aggression against Cambodia. This once again proves that Vietnam's so-called "complete withdrawal" announced in September this year is merely a plot to deceive international public opinion. In reality, Vietnamese troops are still fighting alongside the Phnom Penh puppet army on various battlefields in Cambodia, especially in the western front.

	The news bulletin pointed out that these newly increased Vietnamese troops have three main tasks: first, to serve as the backbone of the Phnom Penh puppet army to fight against the anti-Vietnamese forces in Cambodia; second, to act as the core leadership of various levels of the Cambodian puppet regime; third, to control and direct the Vietnamese spy network in Cambodia, strengthening subversive and sabotage activities.

    越南上月向柬增兵1.4万
  　新华社北京12月7日电  据民主柬埔寨电台广播，民柬国民军总司令部12月4日发表新闻公报，揭露越南在11月中又向柬埔寨增兵1.4万人，加强在柬越军和金边伪军的力量，以抵挡柬埔寨爱国力量的攻势。
    新闻公报说，这批新从越境内运到柬战场的越军全穿金边伪军军装。越南当局除向柬增兵外，还陆续向柬运来坦克、大炮、弹药和其他军事装备，以强化侵柬战争。从而再次证明，越南今年9月宣布的所谓“全部撤军”仅是欺骗国际舆论的阴谋。而实际上越军仍与金边伪军一道在柬各战场，特别是西部战场作战。
    新闻公报指出，这些新增越军有3种任务，一是充当金边伪军的骨干力量、对柬埔寨抗越力量作战；二是充当柬伪各级政权的领导核心；三是控制和指挥越在柬的特务网，加强颠覆、破坏活动。
