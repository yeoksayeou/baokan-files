According to a report by the *New York Times* on November 25, the problem of public urination in New York City has become increasingly severe, posing a significant challenge for city authorities. The report indicates that in this, America's largest city, people are seen urinating in plain sight in various public places, such as street corners, around bridges, near subway entrances, in open spaces, parks, and even at the entrances of apartment buildings, leaving unsightly stains.

Surprisingly, those who engage in this behavior are not just young, ignorant children or taxi drivers, but also well-dressed lawyers and even law enforcement officers. Because public urination has become so common in New York, some visitors to the city have adopted this bad habit as well. The New York City government has stipulated that individuals caught urinating in public places will be fined between $25 and $50. Last year, the city's police, health, and park management departments issued a total of 6,112 tickets for "discharging harmful liquids," with 90% of these tickets issued to individuals caught urinating in public. This number is nearly four times higher than the figure from 1983.

    纽约“怪景”  随地小便
    据《纽约时报》11月25日报道，纽约市公共场所随地小便的现象日趋严重，目前已成了市政当局颇为挠头的社会问题之一。据该报介绍，这个美国第一大城市的一些街头巷尾、大桥周围、地铁出入口、空旷处、公园里、甚至公寓门口，有人毫无顾忌地在那里随地小便，留下斑斑浊迹。
    令人惊奇的是，在这类不讲公德的人当中，不仅有年幼无知的孩童，出租汽车司机，也有西装革履的律师，甚至执法的警察。由于随地小便在纽约成了司空见惯的事情，一些外地人到纽约后也“入乡随俗”，染上了这种不良的习惯。纽约市政当局规定对在公共场所随地小便者处以25至50美元的罚金。去年该市的警察、卫生和公园管理部门共开出“排泄有毒液体”的罚单6112张，其中90％是对付随地小便者的，这个数字同1983年的数字相比，几乎增长了4倍。　（据新华社）
