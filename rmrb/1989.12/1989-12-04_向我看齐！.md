Title: "Look to Me for an Example!"

The newspaper reported that Huang Jiaxi, the county committee secretary of Yueyang County, Hunan Province, said at a county-wide cadre meeting: "In terms of rectifying the party's style, not using power for personal gain, and doing practical work for the people, the leaders of each district, township, and unit should set an example. All levels of party organizations in the county should look to the county committee's standing committee for an example, and the standing committee members should look to me for an example!" (October 20, People's Daily)

The words are few, but they are powerful and precious. If one is not a person who is selfless, pure, upright, and responsible, with a high sense of political responsibility, one would not dare to say such words in public.

Setting an example for others is not easy. It is even harder to be strict with oneself and dare to be strict with others. Those who can be strict with themselves can be good party members and soldiers; those who can be strict with themselves and others can become good leaders and commanders. "Lead by example, and the soldiers will be brave." The saying "a lazy commander makes a lazy army" is rude but vividly and succinctly reveals a truth: the quality and strength of a group depend on the leader.

During the war, a foreign journalist who came to China for a report said he discovered an "interesting phenomenon" in China: the commanders of the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek would shout, "Brothers, charge forward for me!" when leading soldiers into battle. The Red Army commanders would shout, "Comrades, follow me!" in similar situations. One says, "Charge for me!" and the other says, "Follow me!" These few words reveal the essence of the two armies. Thus, the rich content contained in these two short phrases determines the future and fate of these two armies.

We should say that the journalist's observation is very keen. He can capture the most essential characteristics from daily details and vivid language that people often overlook.

We often say that we should leverage our political advantages. What exactly are our political advantages? Party leadership? Of course. Political and ideological work? Also. Theory linked to practice, criticism and self-criticism, and close ties with the masses? All of these. However, no matter how many items we list, serious objective practice tells us that the exemplary role of party members and party leaders is the most important. Without this, everything else—whether it's theory linked to practice, carrying out criticism, or strengthening political and ideological work—will be difficult to implement. Moreover, if words and deeds do not match, the more one speaks, the more likely it is to cause resentment. Using the kind of "tricks" that the masses often mock, such as "big eaters giving speeches and non-eaters listening to speeches," to stop the "feasting wind" is like squatting in a trench with one's buttocks sticking out, shouting, "Brothers, charge forward for me!" Even if you say "brothers," it is of no use, and it is impossible not to lose the battle.

If, in the war years, we could rely on the exemplary role of cadres like "follow me" to defeat the eight hundred thousand Kuomintang troops and win the victory of the new democratic revolution, then in peacetime, in the period of socialist construction, if our cadres can all be like the county committee secretary of Yueyang, Huang Jiaxi, even if we face many and great difficulties, we will definitely have the pioneering force to overcome them.

The day when "look to me for an example" becomes as widespread as "follow me" in the past will be the day when our party's style and social style greatly improve!

    “向我看齐！”
    官伟勋
    报载，湖南省岳阳县县委书记黄甲喜在全县干部会上说：“在端正党风，不以权谋私和为人民办实事这几点上，各区各乡各单位的负责人要当表率，全县各级党组织向县委常委看齐，常委同志向我看齐！”（10月20日《人民日报》）
    话不多，却是字字掷地有声的金玉之言。如果不是一个大公无私、一尘不染、处处行得正做得端，而又当仁不让、以天下为己任、富有高度政治责任感的人，是不会也不敢当众说这样话的。
    以身作则不容易。既能严以律己而又敢严以律人则更难。能严以律己的人，可以是个好党员好战士；既能严以律己又能严以律人的人才会成为一个好领导好将领。“先之以身，后之以人，则士无不勇矣”。所谓“兵熊熊一个，将熊熊一窝”这句话，虽然粗鲁，却十分生动形象而又扼要地道出一个真谛：一个群体的优劣强弱，关键在领导。
    战争年代有位来中国采访的外国记者，说他在中国发现了一个“有趣的现象”：国民党蒋委员长的指挥官们在指挥士兵冲锋时喊的是：“弟兄们给我往上冲呀！”红军的指挥官们在同样的情况下喊的是：“同志们跟我上！”一个“给我冲！”一个“跟我上！”，短短几个字，却把两支军队的本质显露无遗了。从而，这两个短句中所蕴含的丰富内容也决定了这两支军队的前途与命运。
    应该说，这位记者的观察力是十分敏锐的，他能通过日常一些人们熟视无睹习以为常的细节和传神语言抓住其中最本质的特征。
    我们常说要发挥我们的政治优势，究竟什么是我们的政治优势？党的领导？当然是。政治思想工作？当然也是。理论联系实际、批评与自我批评、密切联系群众是不是？都是。然而，不管开列多少条，严峻的客观实践告诉我们，党员与党员领导干部的表率作用是最最重要的一条。没有这一条，其他一切一切，无论理论联系实际也好，开展批评也好，加强思想政治工作也好，都难以落实，而且如果言行不一，讲得越多越容易使人们反感。用群众经常嘲弄的所谓“大吃大喝的做报告，不吃不喝的听报告”一类的“嘴把戏”来制止“吃喝风”，就像自己撅着腚趴在壕沟里，大喊“弟兄们给我往上冲”一样，尽管你叫“弟兄们”，也是无济于事，而且不可能不打败仗。
    如果说，在战争年代我们能够靠“跟我上”这样的干部以身作则的表率作用打垮了八百万国民党军队，赢得了新民主主义革命胜利的话；那么，在和平年代，在社会主义建设时期，我们的干部如果都能像岳阳县县委书记黄甲喜那样，即使我们面前有再多再大的困难，也一定能够具备足以克服它的先锋力量。
    “向我看齐”像当年的“跟我上”那样普及之日，也就是我们的党风社会风大大好转之时！
