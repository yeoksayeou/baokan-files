Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics recently held a discussion on strengthening labor education for students.

A student named "Yi Sheng" wrote a letter to the school leadership, calling for "college students to pick up brooms and mops again," to "clean their own classrooms, corridors, and dormitories, and eliminate laziness."

The school's Higher Education Research Institute, Fu Xionglie, wrote an article stating that "loving labor is an important part of education." Currently, strengthening labor education for college students is an urgent matter. Some middle-aged and elderly teachers also seriously reviewed the scenes of school labor education in the 1950s and 1960s, believing that they "benefited for life."

Accompanying the discussion, some students' labor awareness has been enhanced. The student helpers in the kitchen, who had not been seen for a long time, reappeared. During their free time, students voluntarily clean the school's environment, and the phenomenon of wasting food has also decreased.

    北航开展劳动观念教育讨论
    大学生重新拿起扫帚拖把
    本报讯　北京航空航天大学不久前开展了一次对学生加强劳动观念教育的讨论。
    一名署名“易生”的学生给校领导写信，呼吁“大学生应重新拿起扫帚和拖把”，“自己清理教室楼道、宿舍，去掉懒惰”。
    校高教研究所傅雄烈撰文，认为“热爱劳动是教育的重要内容”。当前，对大学生加强劳动观念教育，是一件刻不容缓的大事。还有一些中、老年教师也认真回顾了50年代、60年代学校劳动教育的情景，认为“终生受益不浅”。
    伴随着讨论，一些学生的劳动观念有所增强，好长时间不见了的学生帮厨又出现了，课余，学生自觉打扫学校的环境卫生，浪费粮食的现象也有所减少。（湘仁）
