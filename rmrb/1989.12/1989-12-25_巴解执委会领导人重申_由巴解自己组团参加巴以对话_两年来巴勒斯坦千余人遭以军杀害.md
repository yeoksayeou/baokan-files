    PLO Executive Committee Leaders Reiterate: PLO to Form Its Own Delegation for Palestinian-Israeli Dialogue

    Over 1,000 Palestinians Killed by Israeli Forces in Two Years

    Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 23

    According to a report by the Jordan Times today, PLO Executive Committee member Khalil al-Hakim recently reiterated that the PLO will insist on forming the Palestinian delegation to participate in Palestinian-Israeli dialogue by itself.

    In response to reports that the PLO should first submit the list of Palestinian delegates to Cairo and then forward it to Washington, al-Hakim said that the PLO will not hand over the list of Palestinian delegates to a third country or to Egypt. He said that allowing any party other than the PLO to appoint members of the Palestinian delegation is dangerous.

    Al-Hakim emphasized that no organization or individual can replace the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat. He reiterated the three principles of the PLO's dialogue with Israel: 1, the PLO, as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has the right to organize and announce the Palestinian delegation; 2, the issue of the self-determination of the Palestinian people should be included in the agenda of the Palestinian-Israeli talks; 3, the Palestinian-Israeli talks should be conducted under international supervision.

    Al-Hakim said that the PLO will play various roles throughout the process of Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.

    Statistical data released by the Palestinian News Office in Cairo today shows that in the past two years of uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 1,003 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces.

    According to the Middle East News Agency, during this period, 53,626 Palestinians were injured by Israeli forces. The Israeli authorities also arrested 58,762 Palestinians, of whom 60 were expelled from the occupied Palestinian territories.

    In addition, the Israeli occupying forces demolished 1,634 Palestinian houses in these two years.

    Facing the repression of the Israeli authorities, the Palestinian people have strengthened their struggle against the Israeli occupation, dealing heavy blows to the Israeli occupying forces, resulting in the deaths of 71 Israeli soldiers and 31 Israeli settlers, and injuring 4,174 Israeli soldiers and 739 Israeli settlers. They also destroyed thousands of Israeli military and civilian vehicles. Israel's economic losses in these two years amounted to $17.32 billion.

    巴解执委会领导人重申

    两年来巴勒斯坦千余人遭以军杀害
    新华社安曼12月23日电  据《约旦时报》今天报道，巴解组织执委会成员胡拉尼日前重申，巴解组织将坚持它自己组织巴勒斯坦代表团参加巴以对话。
    胡拉尼针对有人要求巴解组织将巴勒斯坦代表团名单先交给开罗，然后再转送到华盛顿的报道说，巴解组织不会把巴勒斯坦代表团的名单交给第三国，也不会交给埃及。他说，除巴解组织外，允许任何一方任命巴勒斯坦代表团成员都是危险的。
    胡拉尼强调，绝不允许有任何组织和个人替代巴解组织和它的领导人阿拉法特。他重申巴解组织同以色列对话的三项原则：1，巴解组织作为巴勒斯坦人民的唯一合法代表，有权组织和宣布巴勒斯坦代表团；2，巴勒斯坦人民的自决权问题应列入巴以会谈的议事日程；3，巴以会谈应在国际监督下进行。
    胡拉尼说，在巴以对话问题上巴解组织将自始至终地发挥各种作用。
    新华社开罗12月20日电  巴勒斯坦驻开罗新闻处今天公布的统计资料表明，约旦河西岸和加沙地带在过去两年的起义斗争中，有1003名巴勒斯坦人被以色列军队打死。
    据埃及中东通讯社报道，在此期间，有53626名巴勒斯坦人被以军打伤。以色列当局还逮捕了58762名巴勒斯坦人，其中60人被驱逐出被占领的巴勒斯坦领土。
    此外，以色列占领军在这两年里还强行拆毁了1634座巴勒斯坦人的房屋。
    面对以色列当局的镇压，巴勒斯坦人民加强了反抗以色列占领的斗争，给以色列占领军以沉重打击，造成71名以士兵和31名以移民死亡，4174名以兵和739名以移民受伤。他们还捣毁了几千辆以军车和小轿车。以色列在两年中的经济损失达173.2亿美元。
