Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 7th.

Czechoslovak Federal Government Prime Minister Adamec resigned from his post on December 7th.

According to the CTK news agency, the Czechoslovak National Front Central Committee agreed to Adamec's resignation request. President Husak accepted his resignation and appointed Federal Government First Deputy Prime Minister Chalfourek to temporarily take over government work.

However, according to the spokesman for the "Civic Forum," Dinterstebel, at a press conference held that evening, Chalfourek is not trusted or supported by the "Civic Forum." However, given that the President has appointed him to form a cabinet, the "Civic Forum" is willing to cooperate with him on the condition that he appoints Charnogursky as the First Deputy Prime Minister. The "Civic Forum" also proposed a list of six new government members, including two deputy prime ministers, as well as the ministers of foreign affairs, finance, labor and social affairs, and nationalities.

It is also learned that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held a meeting on December 7th and decided to expel the former General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Jakes, and the former member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and First Secretary of the Prague Municipal Committee, Stepanek, from the party.

    捷总理阿达麦茨辞职
    恰尔发暂时主持政府工作
    新华社布拉格12月7日电  捷联邦政府总理阿达麦茨7日辞去了总理职务。
    据捷通社报道，捷民族阵线中央主席团同意了阿达麦茨的辞职请求，共和国总统胡萨克接受了他的辞呈，并委任捷联邦政府第一副总理恰尔发暂时主持政府工作。
    但据“公民论坛”新闻发言人丁斯特贝尔在当晚举行的记者招待会上说，恰尔发并不为“公民论坛”所信任和支持。但是鉴于总统已委任他组阁，“公民论坛”愿与他合作，条件是他必须任命恰尔诺古尔斯基为第一副总理。“公民论坛”还提出6名新政府成员名单，其中有2名副总理以及外长、财政部长、劳动和社会事务部长和民族问题部长。
    另悉，捷共中央主席团7日开会，决定将原捷共中央总书记雅克什和原捷共中央主席团委员、布拉格市委第一书记什捷潘开除出党。
