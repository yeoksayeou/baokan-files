China will conduct its fourth national population census on July 1, 1990. The State Council has issued the "Regulations for the Fourth National Population Census." At the recently concluded population census work conference, Premier Li Peng issued a mobilization order to the nation. From now on, preparations for the population census will be fully underway across the country. It is a heavy and urgent task for governments at all levels to complete this large-scale social survey involving every person in the country according to the unified standards, steps, and timeline set by the state.

To complete this task, the first step is to have a sense of urgency and ensure that all preparations are in place. The various preparations for the population census must be carried out according to the nationwide unified deployment, one item at a time, one task at a time. The current focus is on ensuring that organizations, personnel, funds, and tasks are in place. For example, regarding the establishment of organizations, although population census organizations have been generally established at the county level and above, some regions still lack personnel, the workforce is not yet robust, and office conditions are not yet in place, which do not match the tasks at hand. Some places have adopted the approach of having the main leaders take the lead, along with the heads of relevant departments, to conduct on-site inspections and office work in various regions, checking and implementing one region at a time. For issues that have not been resolved, decisions are made on the spot, which is a good way to promptly address problems.

An important aspect of the preparations is to promptly carry out propaganda and mobilization work. The population census involves a wide range, and it is necessary for the masses to fully understand the purpose, significance, and requirements of the census in order to actively participate and cooperate closely to ensure the completion of this task. Therefore, propaganda and mobilization work for the population census must start early and be carried out promptly, so that the propaganda and mobilization work for the population census can gradually reach every corner of the country and enter the hearts of every person. Currently, it is especially important to do a good job of ideological work for census workers at all levels, so that they are familiar with the census business, love this work, and strive to do a good job. They should also, through their efforts, do a good job of propaganda and mobilization for the masses.

To expedite the preparations for the population census, all work must revolve around obtaining accurate population data. To this end, work at each stage and link must be completed at a high level, and each locality must establish and implement a post responsibility system and a quality inspection system. All preparatory work must use the ability to ensure the quality of census data as the acceptance standard. This requires that census organizations at all levels not only meticulously arrange the census tasks but also inspect and implement them. Relevant departments must closely cooperate, firmly control the quality, and the masses must actively support the census work to obtain accurate population data. People of all ethnic groups across the country must contribute their strength to the successful completion of the census work.

    人口普查的各项准备工作必须抓紧进行
    本报评论员
    我国将于明年7月1日进行第四次全国人口普查。国务院已经颁布了《第四次全国人口普查办法》，在刚刚结束的人口普查工作会议上，李鹏总理向全国发出了动员令，从现在起人口普查的各项准备工作将在全国各地全面展开。要按照国家规定的统一的标准，统一的步骤，统一的时间，高质量地完成这项涉及全国每一个人的大规模的社会调查工作，是摆在各级政府面前的一项繁重而紧迫的任务。
    为了完成这项任务，首先要有紧迫感，抓紧做好落实工作。人口普查的各项准备工作要按照全国统一的部署，一件一件、一项一项落实。当前，重点是抓好机构、人员、经费、任务的落实工作。比如机构建立问题，目前县以上虽然普遍建立了人口普查机构，但有些地区人员尚未到位，力量还不充实，办公条件也不具备，与其承担的任务还不相适应。有的地方采取主要领导同志带领各有关部门的负责同志，深入各地现场办公，一个地区一个地区地检查落实，对于尚未解决的问题，当场拍板定案，就是一种抓紧解决问题的好办法。
    各项准备工作中，很重要的一项就是要抓紧做好宣传动员工作。人口普查涉及面广，必须使广大人民群众充分认识人口普查的目的、意义和要求，才能积极参加，密切配合，保证这项任务的完成。为此，人口普查的宣传动员工作必须及早下手，抓紧进行，使人口普查的宣传动员工作逐步做到全国各地的每一个角落，深入到每一个人的心上。当前，特别要做好各级普查工作人员的思想工作，使他们熟悉人口普查业务，热爱这项工作，努力做好这项工作，并通过他们做好对广大人民群众的宣传动员工作。
    抓紧人口普查的各项准备工作，要始终围绕取得准确的人口数据这个中心环节。为此，各阶段、各环节上的工作都要高质量地完成，各地都要建立和实行岗位责任制和质量检查制度。各项准备工作都要以能否保证普查数据的质量作为验收标准。这就要求各级普查机构对人口普查的工作任务，不仅要周密布置，而且要有检查有落实，各有关部门要密切配合，牢牢把好质量关，广大人民群众要为了取得准确的人口数据，积极支持人口普查工作。全国各族人民都要为人口普查工作的胜利完成贡献自己的力量。
