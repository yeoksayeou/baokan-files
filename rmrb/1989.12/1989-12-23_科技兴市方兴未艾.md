As a strategy to promote the coordinated development of science, education, economy, and society, the strategy of science and technology for urban development is being implemented in a large number of cities from south to north in China. In early November, the "National Conference on the Strategy of Science and Technology for Medium and Small Cities" was held in Yichang, Hubei. Originally planned for 100 participants, the conference attracted 370 representatives from 140 cities, with many city leaders traveling long distances to attend. It is reported that more than 120 cities in the country have begun to implement the strategy of science and technology for urban development.

Practice has proven that the implementation of this strategy can effectively change the urban landscape, enhance the momentum of urban development, and enable the economy and society to develop in a virtuous cycle.

Huangshi, one of the earliest cities to implement the strategy of science and technology for urban development, was a city with high energy consumption, low economic efficiency, and an irrational industrial structure in the early 1980s. At that time, the per capita energy consumption was 11.3 times the national average. The city has now become a "star" city in Hubei Province. The reason lies in the fact that several years ago, the city realized the importance of science and technology for urban development. After years of effort, it gradually achieved the simultaneous growth of industrial output value, economic efficiency, and development momentum. For four consecutive years, it was rated as an advanced city in economic efficiency in Hubei Province.

Zibo, which began implementing the strategy of science and technology for urban development in 1987, achieved an industrial output value of 9.84 billion yuan in the first nine months of this year, a 27% increase over the same period last year. Tax revenue and fiscal income increased by 16% and 17%, respectively, making the city relatively better off compared to others experiencing economic downturns.

Liuzhou has strengthened the technical absorption and development capabilities of enterprises as a major measure to implement the strategy of science and technology for urban development. In its policies, it stipulates that state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises must establish stable and effective technical development departments separate from those serving normal production. It also clearly stipulates that the effectiveness of promoting enterprise technological development is an important assessment indicator for the tenure of factory directors (managers). Over the past three years, the speed of new product development has significantly accelerated, the development cycle has been shortened, and major industries have successively launched more than 340 new products that are suitable for the market. There have also emerged enterprises that rely on new products to achieve good results. Liuzhou Machinery Factory's development of a type of engine created a production value and tax revenue equivalent to 65% and 34% of the factory's total production value and tax revenue in 1987, respectively. Liuzhou Sock Factory, by tracking market information and updating products annually, has become the leader in production, sales volume, labor productivity, and per capita tax revenue in the same industry nationwide.

To guide enterprises to quickly embark on a path of healthy development relying on scientific and technological progress, many cities have formulated relevant preferential policies and assessment indicators. The Science and Technology Commission and the Economic Commission of Wuxi, after extensive investigations and calculations, established 29 quantitative assessment indicators reflecting enterprise technological progress. They also formed an assessment committee consisting of more than ten relevant departments, which has already selected the first batch of "Top Ten Advanced Enterprises in Scientific and Technological Progress" such as Wuxi Microelectronics United Company, "Top Ten Excellent Scientific Research Institutions" such as the Chinese Shipbuilding Science and Research Center, and "100 Excellent Scientific and Technological Workers." This activity has further promoted the good practices of "respecting knowledge and respecting talents" and "learning science and using science" in Wuxi.

    科技兴市方兴未艾
    本报记者　王友恭
    作为促进科教、经济、社会协调发展的实施战略——科技兴市，正在我国从南到北的一大批城市中推进。11月上旬在湖北宜昌召开的“全国中小城市科技兴市战略研讨会”，原计划100多人参加，结果140多个城市的370多位代表到会，许多市主要领导也千里迢迢赶来听会。据悉目前全国已有120多个城市开始实施科技兴市战略。
  实践证明，这一战略的实施能有效地改变城市面貌，增强城市发展后劲，使城市经济、社会发展走上良性循环。
    较早实施科技建市的黄石市，八十年代初还是一个能耗很高，经济效益低、产业结构很不合理的重工业城市。当时人均能耗是全国人均值的11.3倍，该市现在一跃成为湖北省的“明星”城市，其原因在于早在几年之前就意识到科技兴市的重要性，经过几年努力，逐步实现了全市工业产值增长速度与经济效益、发展后劲同步增长，连续4年被评为湖北省经济效益先进城市。
    1987年开始实施科技兴市战略的淄博市，在其它城市出现经济滑坡的情况下今年1—9月完成工业产值98.4亿元，比去年同期增长27％，税利增长16％，财政收入增长17％，日子相对好过。
    柳州市把强化企业的技术吸收与开发能力作为实施科技兴市的主要措施。在制定的政策中规定国营大中型企业必须建立稳定的、有效的、与为正常生产服务的技术部门分开的技术开发机构，并明确规定能否有成效地推进企业技术开发作为厂长（经理）任期目标的重要考核指标。3年来，新产品开发速度明显加快，开发周期缩短，各主要行业相继推出适销对路新产品340多种，还出现了一批依靠新产品获得好效益的企业。柳州机械厂开发的一种发动机所创产值和税利分别为1987年该厂总产值和税利的65％和34％。柳州市袜厂，跟踪市场信息，年年翻新品种。一跃成为全国同行业产销量、劳动生产率、人均税利之首。
    为了引导企业尽快走上依靠科技进步健康发展的轨道，不少城市都制定了有关这方面的倾斜政策和考核指标。无锡市科委和经委经过大量的调查和测算后建立了29项反映企业技术进步的定量考核指标，并组成了由十几个有关部门参加的考评委员会，已评出无锡微电子联合公司等第一批“十佳科技进步先进企业”、中国船舶科学研究中心等“十佳优秀科研单位”和“百名优秀科技工作者”。这一活动进一步促进了无锡市“尊重知识、尊重人才”和“学科学、用科学”的良好风尚。
