In the early winter, the vegetables in Fuzhou's agricultural markets are fresh and green, while the fish and shrimp are lively. Residents carrying baskets stroll through the long rows of stalls, selecting their preferred fresh produce.

Many of these residents may not realize that to satisfy them, tens of thousands of people working on the "vegetable basket project" have devoted countless efforts. Ensuring Market Stability with the Main Force and Main Channels

After the liberalization of vegetable management, the vegetable market has become a multi-component, multi-channel, and multi-operational landscape. Fuzhou's leaders understand the importance of market stability. They opened the city gates to invite self-producing and self-selling farmers, who have occupied half of the agricultural market. They also introduced state-owned vegetable stores into the urban agricultural markets to stabilize prices and ensure market stability.

Take the basket of vegetables on a farmer's shoulder, for example. How difficult it is for them to enter the city and become the main force in the agricultural market? Departments such as industry and commerce, taxation, urban management, and traffic police are all shaking their heads. Fuzhou has opened the green light for bamboo shoulder poles to enter the city smoothly: establishing large and small vegetable streets and series of stalls; implementing preferential policies on taxes and fees; departments such as industry and commerce serve as the guiding principle...

Farmers entering the city have shifted residents' consumption centers for sideline products to agricultural markets. State-owned stores, however, have shrunk due to being neglected. But farmers, driven by the law of value, often experience price fluctuations. Therefore, Fuzhou decided to allow state-owned stalls to fully enter the urban agricultural markets, operate with clear pricing, and play a role in stabilizing the market and controlling vegetable prices.

Ensuring Balanced Supply through Macroeconomic Control

"The problem of 'shortage and waste' is a major issue in vegetable supply. How can we ensure a balanced supply during the off-season and avoid waste during the peak season? Fuzhou's approach is to control the production scale, layout, support policies, and technological services from four aspects.

Based on residents' demand and consumption structure, Fuzhou has established production bases for vegetables, meat, eggs, fish, poultry, milk, and fruits by determining production based on sales. They have also used incentive mechanisms to motivate producers, providing preferential prices for some fertilizers, films, and pesticides, and implementing grain, fertilizer, and vegetable linkage for secondary and tertiary seasonal vegetable fields to increase investment in vegetable fields. The city, district, township, and village have formed a four-level vegetable production technology service network. They promote vegetable production and development through providing technological information, consulting services, training classes, and cultivating and promoting new varieties.

Using Price Levers to Benefit "Three Parties"

Only by benefiting producers, operators, and consumers can the "vegetable basket project" be successfully implemented. Fuzhou's approach is to use price levers to adjust the relationship between the "three parties," ensuring that producers make a profit, operators maintain a small profit, and consumers can afford it.

Last October, the price of compound feed per hundred kilograms was raised by 5 yuan, affecting pork prices. To protect consumers' interests, the municipal government, after coordinating with various parties, regulated that the feed price per hundred kilograms could only be raised by 2.6 yuan, with the remaining 2.4 yuan to be absorbed by the enterprises. The purchase price of live pigs per hundred kilograms was raised from 380 yuan to 390 yuan, with 10 yuan to be absorbed by the food company. This basically maintained the retail price of meat unchanged.

Since 1985, Fuzhou has had only 4.2 million yuan in vegetable production and sales fiscal subsidies, with an average of only 3 yuan per person per year, making it the only provincial capital city that has decreased from the 1984 base number. Fuzhou has cleverly used this money to concentrate on subsidizing major vegetables during the off-season, disasters, or overproduction. This has ensured that market prices remain basically stable and protected the interests of producers.

    用菜园子保菜篮子
    ——福州市“菜篮子工程”一瞥
    本报记者　张铭清
    初冬时节，福州市农贸市场的蔬菜碧绿鲜嫩，鱼虾活蹦乱跳。提篮选购的市民徜徉在琳琅满目的摊点长河中，挑拣着各自中意的鲜货。
    他们当中相当一些人未必知道，为了使他们满意，成千上万为“菜篮子工程”辛勤劳作的人们，不知耗费了多少心血。靠主力军和主渠道稳定市场
    蔬菜放开经营后，蔬菜市场形成了多经济成分、多流通渠道、多经营方式的局面。福州市领导深知稳定市场的重要。他们打开城门，请自产自销的菜农这支主力军占领了农贸市场的“半壁江山”；又把国营菜店这一主渠道引进市区农贸市场，以平抑菜价，稳定市场。
    就说菜农肩上那一挑菜，要进城门当农贸市场的主力谈何容易？工商、税务、城管、交警……一大串部门在向进城的菜农摇头摆手呢。福州市为竹扁担顺利进城大开了绿灯：开辟大大小小的蔬菜街和系列摊点；在税、费上实行优惠政策；工商等部门则以服务为宗旨……
    菜农进城，居民将副食品消费中心转到了农贸市场。国营店却因受冷遇出现萎缩。但菜农受价值规律支配，菜价经常出现波动。为此，福州市决定让国营摊点全面进入市区农贸市场，挂牌经营，明码标价，发挥了主渠道稳定市场、平抑菜价的作用。
    靠宏观调控保证均衡供应
    “少了喊，多了烂”，是蔬菜供应的一大难题。如何做到淡季不淡、旺季不烂、保证均衡供应？福州的办法是从生产规模、生产布局、扶持政策、科技服务四个方面进行宏观调控。
    根据居民的需求量和消费结构，福州市以销定产，建立起菜、肉、蛋、鱼、禽、奶、果生产基地。他们还通过奖励机制调动生产者的积极性，对部分化肥、薄膜、农药实行优惠价供应，对二三线季节菜地实行粮、肥、菜挂钩，增加菜地投入，实行以工补菜。市、区、乡、村形成四级蔬菜生产科技服务网。他们通过提供科技信息、咨询服务、办培训班和培育推广新品种促进蔬菜生产发展。
  靠价格杠杆使“三者”受益
    只有使生产者、经营者、消费者三者受益，“菜篮子工程”才能顺利实施。福州的做法是用价格杠杆调整“三者”关系，使生产者有利可图，经营者保本微利，消费者承受得起。
    去年10月，每百公斤配合饲料提价5元，牵动猪肉提价。为照顾消费者利益，市府经过多方协调，规定饲料每百公斤只准提2.6元，其余2.4元由企业自行消化。毛猪收购价每百公斤由380元提到390元，10元由食品公司自行消化。这样，基本保持零售肉价不变。
    从1985年以来，福州市只有420万元蔬菜产销财政补贴，人均每年只3元钱，是全国唯一比1984年基数减少的省会城市。福州市巧用这笔钱，集中对淡季、受灾或生产过旺时的大路菜补贴。既保证了市价基本稳定，也保护了生产者利益。
