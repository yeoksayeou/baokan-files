    Shaanxi Coalfield Geological Team Unveils Secrets After Nine Years: Abundant Underground Water in Weibei

    Four hundred meters below the surface lies 110 billion cubic meters of Ordovician limestone water

    Our reporter Jing Xianfeng reports: Who would have thought that the Weibei dry region, which has been called the "dry belt" by the people of Shaanxi for thousands of years, hides abundant water resources beneath its surface? This unique geological structure and phenomenon of "dry above and wet below" in northern China was revealed after nine years of hard work by the 131st exploration team of the Shaanxi Coalfield Geology Bureau.

    The Weibei dry region, which stretches across the central part of Shaanxi, is a large coalfield known as the "black belt" of Shaanxi. As coal mining progresses, water inrush accidents frequently occur. It is estimated that about half of the proven coal reserves in the mining area cannot be exploited due to water hazards.

    In stark contrast, the severely water-scarce Weibei dry region has nearly 15 million mu of farmland that are basically rain-fed.

    According to experts, the abundant water resources 400 meters below the surface of the Weibei dry region are stored in the Middle-Lower Ordovician limestone layer, which is about 500 million years old, and are thus called Ordovician limestone water. To unravel the mystery of the "dry above and wet below" in Weibei, the 131st exploration team, which has dedicated several decades to the coalfield geological front, has since 1981 conducted a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogeology of this region. Currently, the origin, location, boundaries, controlling factors, quality, and reserves of the underground water have been basically clarified. The results show that the Ordovician limestone water, with a total reserve of 110 billion cubic meters, can maintain the current balance of underground water in Weibei for a long time if the allowable extraction rate is 36,000 cubic meters per hour.

    陕西煤田地质队历时九年揭开奥秘
    渭北地下水蕴藏丰富
    四百多米深处有一百一十亿立方米奥灰水
    本报讯　记者景险峰报道：谁能想到，千百年来被陕西老乡称作“旱腰带”的渭北旱原，在其地下竟蕴藏着丰富的水资源。这一“上旱下涝”的北国奇观和地质构造奥秘，是由该省煤田地质131勘探队费时9载，历尽艰辛，于日前揭示出来的。
    横跨三秦大地中部的渭北旱原，地下是个大煤田，素有陕西“黑腰带”之称。随着煤矿采掘，“突水”事故时有发生。据测算，矿区已探明的煤炭储量，约有一半因水害威胁不能开采。
    与此形成鲜明对照的是，严重缺水的渭北旱原，近1500万亩耕地基本是旱田。
    据专家考证，渭北旱原400多米深处以下丰富的水资源，蕴藏在距今约5亿年的中下奥陶纪石灰岩层中，故被称之为奥灰水。为揭开渭北“上旱下涝”之谜，在煤田地质战线奉献了几十个春秋的131勘探队，1981年以来对这个地区的水文地质作了综合分析。目前，对地下水的来龙去脉、含水层位、边界条件、控水因素、水质和储量等均基本探清。成果表明，总储量达110亿立方米的奥灰水，在允许开采量为每小时36000立方米的情况下，可长期保持渭北地下水处于目前的平衡状态。
