    Adequate, Scientific, and Rational

    Ministry of Land and Resources, Planning Department

    How can we prevent the worsening of the severe land crisis currently facing our country? I believe that we must start now, earnestly strengthen the planned management of land use, stand firm on the present while considering the long term, and strictly ensure that land is used adequately, scientifically, and rationally.

    Land use must strictly follow the plan. Since 1987, the nation has been issuing annual construction land use plans, setting mandatory control targets for state construction, collective construction, and farmers' housing land use. All regions must use land according to the plan, allowing only for savings, not exceeding the limits. In the past two years, non-agricultural construction land use has been strictly managed, but now it is clear that agricultural construction land use must also be strictly controlled.

    Land use for agricultural structural adjustments must be controlled. In recent years, planting fruit trees and digging fish ponds have accounted for more than 50% of the reduction in arable land. While structural adjustments must consider economic benefits, they must also, based on national conditions, consider social and ecological benefits. In the future, planting fruit trees and digging fish ponds must not occupy good arable land.

    Each region should plan to open up a portion of wasteland annually. Our country still has some reserve arable land resources, and most regions have some scattered, idle, and abandoned land. In addition to the state's organized comprehensive development of key areas, collective and individual development of scattered, idle land should be encouraged. Regions and units approved for construction land use must undertake the responsibility of developing equivalent arable land.

    Reclaiming damaged land. The cumulative land damaged by industry, energy, transportation, and other production and construction activities has reached over 30 million mu. Enterprises and individuals that damage land must reclaim it as it is damaged and cannot leave it unreclaimed. For the over 30 million mu of already damaged land, the principle of "who reclaims benefits" should be adopted, and it should be reclaimed year by year.

    充分  科学  合理
    国家土地管理局规划司　刘广金
    如何避免我国目前面临的严重土地危机进一步加剧？我认为，必须从现在开始，切切实实加强对土地利用的计划管理，立足当前，考虑长远，严格做到充分、科学、合理地利用土地。
    严格按照计划用地。全国已从1987年开始，每年下达建设占用耕地计划，对国家建设，集体建设和农民建房占用耕地都下达了指令性控制指标。各地都应当按照计划用地，只准节约，不准超过。前两年对非农建设占用耕地管理较严，现在看来，对农业建设占用耕地也要严格控制。
    农业内部结构调整占用耕地要控制。前几年，种果树、挖鱼塘等占地约占同期耕地面积减少数的50％以上。调整结构当然要顾及经济效益，但从国情出发，还必须考虑社会和生态效益。今后种果树、挖鱼塘等，不能再占用好耕地。
    各地每年都要有计划地开垦一部分荒地。我国尚有一部分后备耕地资源，大部分地区都有一些零星闲散废弃地。除国家有重点地组织综合开发外，应鼓励集体和个人合理开发零星闲散土地。建设批准占用耕地的地区和单位，应当承担开发等质等量的耕地义务。
    复垦被破坏的土地。工矿、能源、交通等生产和建设累计被破坏土地已达3000多万亩。破坏土地的企业单位和个人对新破坏的土地应当做到随破坏随复垦，不能欠帐。对于已破坏的3000多万亩土地采取谁复垦谁受益的原则，逐年复垦完。
