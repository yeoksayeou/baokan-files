The soldiers of a certain military group stationed in Henan treat the people as their parents and the station as their home. They work together with the local people to build a socialist spiritual civilization, promoting military-civilian unity and social stability in the area. During an inspection, Yang Baibing, Secretary of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department, praised the activity for benefiting both military and social stability. He called for the two slogans to be shouted louder.

The party committee of this military group, while analyzing and solving some military-civilian disputes, found that these disputes, although having complex social causes, were also due to the weak sense of the masses among some officers and soldiers. Therefore, they clearly proposed these two sentences and carried out in-depth education on the purpose of the army within the troops, enhancing the feelings of the officers and soldiers towards the people as their parents. They used the opportunities of new recruits enlisting, old soldiers retiring, the August 1st Army Day, and the New Year and Spring Festival to repeatedly organize the officers and soldiers to study the fundamental nature and purpose of the army, and to concretize the education of loving the people.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of this military group help the local area to develop the economy as if they were building their own hometown. Over the past two years, they have given up many labor contracts, mobilized a large number of manpower and more than 5,000 times of large machinery, participated in more than 170 major social public welfare projects, and made significant contributions to the construction of important projects such as the Huanghe Road Bridge in Kaifeng, the large highway on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the Yuzhou Power Plant, the Gongxian Railway Station, and the Tianmu Mountain Road. Troops stationed in rural areas pull water to combat drought during dry seasons and drain water to ensure a bumper harvest during floods. Various units have rushed out more than 80 times, rescued 112 people in danger, and rushed to transport 250,000 tons of materials, further harmonizing military-civilian relations.

The actions of this military group have been warmly praised by the Henan Provincial Government and the local people where the troops are stationed. The relevant departments of the Henan Provincial Government also took the slogan "treating the stationed troops as family" to organize the masses to enthusiastically carry out activities to support the military and take care of the families of the soldiers.

    视人民为父母　把驻地当故乡
    驻豫某集团军与当地群众共建精神文明
    据新华社郑州12月28日电　（记者谭道博、通讯员张向持）“视人民为父母，像尊重父母那样尊重人民；把驻地当故乡，像热爱故乡那样热爱驻地。”驻豫某集团军指战员按照这个宗旨与驻地群众共建社会主义精神文明，促进了军民团结和驻地社会稳定。中央军委秘书长、总政治部主任杨白冰上将在这里视察时，称赞这一活动有利于军队和社会两个稳定，要求把这两句口号叫得更响。
    这个集团军党委在分析、解决一些军民纠纷时感到，这些纠纷的出现固然有复杂的社会原因，但少数官兵群众观念淡薄是个不可忽视的因素。于是，他们鲜明地提出这两句话，在部队深入开展我军宗旨的教育，增强指战员视人民为父母的感情。他们利用新兵入伍、老兵退役、“八一”建军节和新年、春节等时机，反复组织官兵学习我军的根本性质和宗旨，并把爱人民的教育具体化。
    这个集团军广大指战员像建设故乡那样帮助驻地搞好经济建设。两年来，他们辞掉不少劳务承包，抽出大批人力和5000多台次大型机械，参加170多项较大的社会公益工程建设，为开封黄河公路大桥、京广大型公路、禹州电厂、巩县火车站和天目山公路等重要建设作出了贡献。驻农村的部队旱时为群众拉水抗旱，涝时为群众排涝保丰收。各部队先后出动80多次，抢救遇险群众112人，抢运物资2.5万多吨，使军民关系进一步融洽。
    这个集团军的行动得到河南省政府和部队驻地群众的热情赞扬。河南省政府有关部门也以“把驻军当亲人”为口号，组织群众热烈开展拥军优属活动。
