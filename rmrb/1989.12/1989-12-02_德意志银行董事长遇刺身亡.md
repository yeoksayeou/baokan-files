The chairman of Deutsche Bank, one of West Germany's three major banks, Alfred Herrhausen, was killed by a bomb on the morning of November 30. The political and economic circles in West Germany were in an uproar.

At around 8:30 AM on November 30, just as Herrhausen was about to leave Bad Homburg by car to go to Frankfurt, a bomb exploded, killing Herrhausen on the spot. His driver was also seriously injured and died shortly afterward.

Federal Prosecutor General Alexander von Stahl has taken over the investigation of this case.

Herrhausen was 59 years old and had been the chairman of Deutsche Bank since 1985.
