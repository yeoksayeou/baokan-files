	The People's Daily reports: On November 16, the second page of this newspaper published the news titled "Telegraph System to Use Wubi Input Technology," which stated that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had decided to gradually replace the outdated four-digit telegraph code with the Wubi input method for computer Chinese character input. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Publicity Department recently sent a letter to this newspaper pointing out that this report was inaccurate. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has no intention of replacing the standard telegraph code with any other code.

	The letter stated that recently, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had issued the "Temporary Regulations on Requirements for Chinese Character User Telegraph Terminal Equipment to Connect to the Network" and recommended four Chinese character input code schemes to users: simplified Hanyu Pinyin, Wubi, phonetic sound, and standard telegraph code. These schemes were recommended from those that have been in use for a relatively long time, have a wide range of applications, and have a large user base. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' recommended schemes are neither ranked nor do they involve "replacing one with another."

	The letter pointed out: "The standard telegraph code has been in use in our country for over a hundred years and is familiar to a wide range of telegraph operators and professionals. It is also used in Taiwan and Hong Kong and Macau regions. This telegraph code has the characteristics of uniqueness and no duplicate codes and will continue to be used in the future."

    邮电部宣传处来函告知
    标准电报码仍将继续使用
    本报讯　11月16日，本报第二版刊登了《电报系统将用五笔字型技术》的消息，其中说，邮电部决定将用五笔字型电脑汉字输入技术“逐步取代落后的四位数字电报码”。邮电部宣传处日前致函本报，指出这一报道失实。邮电部没有用其它码取代标准电报码的打算。
    来信说，不久前，邮电部颁布了“汉字用户电报终端设备进网要求（暂行规定）”，并向用户推荐了四种汉字输入码方案，即普及型汉语拼音、五笔字型、声韵声声和标准电报码。这是从目前使用时间较长、应用面较广、使用量较大的汉字输入方案中推荐出来的。邮电部推荐的上述方案既未排名次也不存在“谁代替谁”的问题。
    来信指出：“标准电报码已在我国沿用了一百多年，并为广大报务员和专业人员所熟悉。在台湾和港澳地区也通用。这种电报码具有唯一性、无重码等特点，今后仍将继续使用。”
