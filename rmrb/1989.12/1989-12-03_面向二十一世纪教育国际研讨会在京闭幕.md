The six-day International Symposium on Education for the 21st Century concluded today in Beijing. Vice Minister of the State Education Commission, He Dongchang, delivered a speech at the closing ceremony. Mr. Paul, the representative of the Director-General of UNESCO and the Assistant Director-General for Education, also spoke.

During the symposium, experts and scholars from various countries freely exchanged views, shared experiences, and engaged in extensive discussions on the challenges facing 21st-century education. They also studied strategies, offering many valuable suggestions, plans, and proposals.

A total of 46 papers were presented at the symposium, with 25 of them from China.

In his speech, He Dongchang emphasized that recognizing the significant role of education in social, economic, and technological development has become a global trend. China is fully committed to its socialist modernization. Over the past decade, China has elevated the importance of education. Deng Xiaoping proposed that education should be oriented towards modernization, the world, and the future. As an ancient educational nation, we have been adapting to modernization needs for nearly a century by absorbing modern educational experiences from various countries. In the past decade, the scale of exchanges and learning from the strengths of other nations has reached an unprecedented level. He stressed that the best experiences must be combined with China's actual situation. Therefore, we also emphasize the characteristics of socialist education in China. This education should be loved and served by the Chinese people.

Paul stated that through this symposium, we have deepened our mutual understanding and strengthened our friendship. Moreover, the symposium provided two reports to UNESCO on how to develop education for the 21st century. In the future, UNESCO is willing to continue strengthening cooperation with China, discussing solutions to the challenges facing 21st-century education, and hopes to hold such conferences in China or other countries.

    面向二十一世纪教育国际研讨会在京闭幕
    本报北京12月2日讯　记者魏玉凤报道：历时6天的面向21世纪教育国际研讨会今天在北京圆满结束。国家教委副主任何东昌在闭幕式上致词。联合国教科文组织总干事代表、教育助理总干事波尔先生讲了话。
    会议期间，各国专家、学者畅所欲言，交流了情况和经验，对21世纪教育面临的挑战进行了广泛充分的讨论，并研究了对策，提出了许多有益的意见、建议、计划和方案。
    这次会议各国专家、学者提供论文共46篇，其中，中国有25篇。
    何东昌在致词中说，重视教育在社会、经济、科技发展中的巨大作用，已经成为世界性的潮流。中国正在全力以赴地推进自己的社会主义现代化建设。最近10年来，中国把发展教育提到新的高度。邓小平同志提出教育要面向现代化、面向世界、面向未来。作为一个教育的古国，要适应现代化的需要，近100多年来，我们就开始吸收各国的现代教育经验。近10年来，吸收各国之长的交流活动，达到了空前的规模。他强调，从我们的历史经验看来，最好的经验也必须与我们中国的实际结合。因此，我们又强调了中国特色的社会主义教育。这个教育要为中国人民所喜爱，并为他们服务。
    波尔说，通过这次会议，我们大家之间增进了互相了解，加强了友谊，而且就如何发展21世纪教育，会议向联合国教科文组织提供了两个报告。今后，教科文组织愿意继续同中国加强合作，讨论解决21世纪教育面临的问题，并希望能在中国或其他国家举办这样的会议。
