The merit book records the outstanding achievements of cadres and workers in production, safety, quality, economy, study, and helping others, inspiring the advanced and encouraging the laggards. It is an effective method for strengthening ideological and political work.

Aiyouqin, a national labor model and "Iron Man" of the mining industry, is renowned throughout the coal industry. However, how this national labor model was selected is little known. In 1981, a responsible person from the former Ministry of Coal went to Hebei to understand the situation of selecting labor models. After visiting some cities and hearing the stories of some people, he still felt uneasy. When he arrived at the Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan, the mine leaders took out the three large merit books of the Coal Mining Area 3, which recorded Aiyouqin's deeds one by one. This responsible person was deeply moved.

In mid-October of this year, the author came to Tangjiazhuang Mine for an interview and saw the four large merit books of the Coal Mining Area 3, which have been filled with records over the past 13 years. Starting from August this year, the fifth book has begun to be recorded. The merit book shows dozens of different handwritings, recording the outstanding deeds of all cadres and workers in the area over the past 13 years in production, safety, quality, economy, study, and helping others, totaling about 5,000 items. The party, government, and trade union cadres of the Coal Mining Area 3 call recording the merit book "hard work," but this down-to-earth "hard work" has recorded the growth process of a group of advanced models and exemplary figures.

The merit book of the Coal Mining Area 3 was established on August 30, 1976. After the Tangshan earthquake, the workers endured the pain of losing their loved ones and began the restoration and reconstruction. The trade union cadres of the Coal Mining Area 3 were moved by the workers' tenacious struggle and spontaneously recorded their deeds one by one. The initial records were as follows:

On August 30, Dong Xiangzhong and seven others worked for a day and then ran more than ten miles to help the seriously injured Guo Huixi's family demolish their house, working until late at night.

The Communist Youth League member Li Xiuchi had a high fever of 39°C, but she worked in the rain with everyone else.

The water in the mine was bone-chilling. At a critical moment in draining the water, the water pipe was blocked. Dong Yinyou took off his clothes and went into the water to remove the obstruction....

In this way, in eight months, the workers' deeds of draining water, restoring the mine, and rebuilding the mine were recorded in a large book. In April 1977, Tangjiazhuang Mine resumed coal production, and they began to record the deeds of the coal war. In the Coal Mining Area 3, recording the merit book is not just the responsibility of the trade union chairman and party and government leaders; technical cadres and workers also eagerly record the shining deeds they see on the merit book. Over the past 13 years, the Coal Mining Area 3 has had five trade union chairmen, and the workers have changed in batches, but the recording of the merit book has continued without interruption.

The person with the most deeds recorded in the merit book is Aiyouqin. Opening the second merit book, the first page has a small statistic: in 1978, from January to September, Aiyouqin worked 47 consecutive shifts, did 53 extra shifts, and drilled 2,305 pillars, including 1,305 extra pillars. It was from the accumulation of quantity that people saw Aiyouqin's model deeds.

Working underground to mine coal is hard, tiring, and dangerous, and some people regard it as a dreadful place. Someone said, "If you put 200 yuan on the 'working face,' I wouldn't go even if you gave it to me for free." Miners fight year-round underground, which is very great. The party and government leaders of the Coal Mining Area 3 realized from practice that recording the merit book is sometimes just a few simple words, sometimes a statistical list. As long as there is a record of him in the merit book, he feels that the leaders see him, and his heart is comforted. Once a worker saw his deed recorded in the merit book and excitedly recalled, "This is recorded by Da Shen (Shen Yaoliang, the technical staff of the mining area, now the chief engineer of the mine)." His words fully expressed that sense of pride and the intimate feelings between the leaders and the workers. Recording the merit book is indeed hard work, but it is an effective method of ideological and political work.

The merit book not only records the growth process of heroes and models but also gives strength to the laggards and encourages them to strive forward. The miner Liu Baoying once had many absences and sometimes participated in gambling, causing family discord. On January 25, 1987, the Spring Festival, some peasant workers went home to celebrate the festival, and the class was short of hands, so he also joined the extra shift. After coming out of the mine, the trade union cadres recorded his deed in the merit book. This seemingly ordinary matter deeply moved Liu Baoying. In the past, he felt that his life was over and that no one would believe him if he wanted to do good. He didn't expect that by working with everyone on the festival and recording it in the merit book, he would be encouraged. He told his comrades: "I have to work hard now." Since then, he has had more attendance and his family has been harmonious. Now he has become the leader of the material transportation team.

The Coal Mining Area 3 once had a few "troublemakers." In early 1986, when the area implemented the labor combination, they were left out by various teams. These few people formed their own team under the leadership of team leader Kong Jingui and decided to prove themselves. They proposed to compete with Aiyouqin's team. Most people thought they were just joking. However, the trade union cadres paid great attention to their actions and recorded any good deed in the merit book, making them more enthusiastic. After three years of hard work, by 1988, they drilled 1,000 more pillars than Aiyouqin's team.

"With iron arms, the coal sea turns; with iron fists, the rock layers are broken. In the vast coal sea, the dragon and tiger leap forward with increased vigor." From the words written on the cover page of the merit book, one seems to hear the sound of labor competition drums. In 13 years, the Coal Mining Area 3 of Tangjiazhuang Mine has fought in more than 40 coal mining faces. These coal mining faces are all "edge, corner, and residual" areas with broken roofs, heavy water seepage, thin coal seams, and poor geological conditions. Every time they encounter difficult environments, they carry forward the spirit embodied in the merit book, overcome difficulties, and achieve high production. From May 1977 to August this year, they have produced 3.65 million tons of coal for the state, not only making up for the losses caused by the earthquake but also exceeding the target by 1.74 million tons.

Now, the Coal Mining Area 3 places the merit book in the trade union office. Old workers can recall beautiful memories by looking at it, and young workers can gain the strength to move forward. The secretary and team leaders of the mining area use it as teaching material for ideological and political work. Before and after class meetings, they use it to praise the advanced, the mine's broadcasting station writes scripts based on it, reporters find clues from it, and at the end of the year, the merit book is the basis for evaluating the advanced. The merit book is a spiritual pillar for the workers, and everyone strives to be on the "merit book."

    唐家庄煤矿的“功劳簿”
    功劳簿，记载着干部、工人在生产、安全、质量、节约、学习、助人为乐等方面的先进事迹，给先进者以鼓舞，促后进者奋进，是加强思想政治工作的有效方法之一

    全国劳模、矿山“铁人”艾有勤，名震煤炭行业。然而艾有勤这个全国劳模是怎样选出来的却鲜为人知。1981年，原煤炭部一位负责人到河北了解评选劳模的情况，走了一些城市，听了一些人的事迹，总觉得心里不踏实。当他来到开滦唐家庄矿时，矿领导搬出采煤三区的三大本功劳簿，上面一宗一件地记载着艾有勤的事迹，这位负责人被深深感动了。
    今年10月中旬，笔者来到唐家庄矿采访，见到了采煤三区工会13年来记得满满的4大本功劳簿。今年8月份起已开始记第5本。功劳簿上可以看出几十种不同笔体，记载着全区干部、工人13年中在生产、安全、质量、节约、学习、助人为乐等方面的先进事迹，约5000多件。采煤三区的党政工干部称记功劳簿是“笨功夫”，但这种扎扎实实的“笨功夫”却记录下了一批先进典型和模范人物成长的历程。
    采煤三区功劳簿始建于1976年8月30日。唐山大地震后，工人们忍受着失去亲人的悲痛，开始了恢复建设。采煤三区工会干部被工人们顽强拚搏的工作精神所感动，情不自禁地把一件件事迹记录了下来。开始几件是这样写的：
    8月30日，董祥仲等7人奋战了一天，下班后，又跑了十几里帮助受重伤的郭会喜家拆房子，一直干到晚上9点多。
    共青团员李秀岐高烧39℃，也同大家一样冒雨奋战。
    矿井里水凉彻骨。在排水关键时刻，水笼头被卡住了。董印友脱了衣服就下水排障碍。……
    就这样，8个月时间，工人们排水复矿，重建矿山的事迹记了满满一大本。1977年4月，唐家庄矿恢复出煤，他们又开始了煤海战功的记载。在采煤三区，记功劳簿不单是工会主席、党政领导的事，技术干部、工人们都争相把自己见到的闪光事迹记上功劳簿。13年来，采煤三区换了5任工会主席，职工也一茬茬更新，但记功劳簿一直坚持未断。
    在功劳簿上记载事迹最多的是艾有勤。翻开第二本功劳簿，第一页有个小统计，1978年1—9月，艾有勤共连班47次，多做工53个，打柱2305棵，其中多打1305棵。人们正是从量的积累中看到了艾有勤同志的模范事迹。
    井下挖煤苦、累、险，被一些人视为畏途。有人说，“掌子面”上放200元钱，让我白拿我都不去。矿工们常年战斗在井下，这就很伟大。采煤三区的党政领导从实践中认识到，记功劳簿有时是简单几句话，有时是一个统计名单。只要功劳簿上有他，他就觉得领导眼里有他，心里就熨贴。有一次一位工人看到功劳簿上记着他的事迹，兴奋地回忆说，这是大沈（沈耀良，采区技术员、现任矿总工程师）给我记上的。话语中充分表达了那种自豪感和干群之间的亲切情感。记功劳簿虽然是笨工夫，但确是思想政治工作的一种有效方法。
    功劳簿不但记录下英雄模范们成长的足迹，也给后进者以力量，促其奋进。矿工刘宝营一度脱班较多，有时还参加赌博，闹得家庭不和。1987年1月25日过年这天，一部分农民轮换工回家过年去了，班上人手少，他也跟着加班。上井后工会干部把他记上了功劳簿。这看似平常的事，使刘宝营深受感动。过去他觉得这辈子完了，想好也没人相信，没想到跟着大伙节日加班还上了功劳簿。他对同志们说：我得好好干了。此后他出勤多了，家庭也和睦了。现在他成了运料小队长。
    采煤三区过去有几个“嘎小子”，1986年初三区实行劳动组合时，被各小队甩了出来，这哥几个自己组成一个队，在队长孔金贵带领下决心争口气。他们提出要和艾有勤小队争个高下。多数人都当他们是说着玩的。可是工会干部对他们的行动非常注意，发现一点好事就记功劳簿，使他们越干劲越足。经过三年苦战，到1988年他们比艾有勤小队多超1000棵柱。
      “铁臂扭动煤海转，铁拳砸裂岩石层。茫茫煤海摆擂台，龙腾虎跃干劲增。”从写在功劳簿扉页的话中，似乎听到了劳动竞赛的战鼓声。13年，唐家庄矿采煤三区转战了40多个采煤面。这些采煤面都是顶板破碎、淋水如雨、煤层薄、地质条件差的“边、角、残”地段。每遇艰险环境，他们都发扬功劳簿所体现的精神，闯难关，夺高产。从1977年5月到今年8月，他们共为国家产煤365万吨，不但补回了地震损失，还超产174万吨。
    如今，采煤三区把功劳簿摆在工会办公室里，老工人看了能引起美好的回忆，青年工人看了能获得前进的力量。采区的书记、队长把它做为思想政治工作的教材，在班前，班后会上表扬先进靠它，矿广播站写稿靠它，来了记者从这里边找线索，年终评先进功劳簿是依据。功劳簿是工人们的一个精神支柱，人人争上“功劳簿”。
