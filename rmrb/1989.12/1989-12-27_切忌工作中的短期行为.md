Short-term behavior is a kind of behavior that only considers the present without thinking about the future. It manifests to varying degrees in various departments and industries. I will list a few examples:

Exhausting the resources. Some enterprises make short-term operational decisions, focusing only on economic benefits within the contracting period or even the current year. They overuse equipment, funds, and manpower, paying little attention to the enterprise's long-term goals and development direction. Management behavior is also short-term, pursuing production value and profits one-sidedly, revolving around the contracting indicators, and neglecting the ideological and political work of the staff. They also relax the construction of the staff's quality and institutional building. Distribution behavior is short-term, with blind bonuses and material incentives, causing the growth of staff bonuses to far exceed the growth of labor productivity and enterprise economic benefits.

Exploitative management. Currently, some places have seen farmers' emotional attachment to land weaken, adopting an exploitative management approach of "minimal investment, maximum output, or even output without investment." They farm the land without nurturing it, leading to a decline in soil fertility.

One-sided pursuit of admission rates. Many administrative leaders and educational department leaders regard admission rates as the "sole standard" for evaluating school work and teaching quality. Schools violate educational laws, endlessly increasing students' extracurricular burdens, leading to students studying to meet teachers' expectations and teachers teaching to meet exam requirements. This way, admission rates rise in the short term, but often result in "high scores but low abilities," or cause students with middle to low scores to drop out.

Prioritizing economy over environmental protection. Many people have weak ecological and environmental awareness, rarely considering what to leave for future generations. Objectively speaking, the evaluation of leaders' achievements is "economy looks at production value, appearance looks at urban construction, and environmental protection is not considered." This results in many enterprises only caring about making money, not about environmental protection, and even less about treatment. Some enterprises' contracting agreements do not even include environmental protection as a condition.

### 切忌工作中的短期行为

    切忌工作中的短期行为
    短期行为是一种只顾眼前不顾长远的行为，它在各个部门、行业都有程度不同的表现。我列举几种：
    竭泽而渔。有的企业经营决策行为短期化，只重视承包期内甚至当年的经济效益，拼设备、资金、人力，对企业的后劲、长远目标和发展方向考虑甚少；管理行为短期化，片面追求产值、利润，围绕承包指标“转”，忽视职工的思想政治工作，放松职工队伍素质建设和制度建设；分配行为短期化，盲目的奖金刺激、物质刺激，造成职工的奖金增长远远高于劳动生产率和企业经济效益的增长。
    掠夺经营。目前，有些地方的农民对土地的感情淡化，采取“少投入多产出，不投入也产出”的掠夺经营方式，种地不养地，造成地力下降。
    片面追求升学率。不少行政领导和教育部门的领导，把升学率作为衡量学校工作和教学质量的“唯一标准”。学校教学违背教育规律，无限增加学生的课外负担，造成学生为应付教师而学，教师为应付考试而教。这样，短期内升学率上去了，却往往是“高分低能”，或导致成绩中低等的学生流失。
    重经济轻环保。许多人生态意识、环境意识淡薄，很少考虑为后人留下什么。从客观上讲，考核领导干部的政绩是
  “经济看产值，面貌看城建，环保不挂号”，造成不少企业只管挣钱，不管环保，更不管治理，有些企业的承包合同上根本没有环保这一条。
