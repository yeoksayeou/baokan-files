Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th — The State Council recently held the National Planning Conference and the National Financial Work Conference. In accordance with the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party, and adhering to the principle of earnestly implementing further rectification and deepening reform, the conference specifically deployed the economic work for 1990. The conference required all levels of leadership, the broad masses of cadres, and workers to boost their spirits, enhance their confidence, and work hard to ensure that the national economy maintains stable development in the coming year.

During the conference, Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin listened to reports from some provincial, municipal, and autonomous region leaders and gave important speeches. State Council leaders Wu Xueqian, Li Tieying, Qin Jiwei, Wang Bingqian, Zhu Rongji, Chen Xitong, and Luo Gan attended the conference.

The conference analyzed China's current economic situation. The conference believed that after a year of hard work, the rectification and deepening of reform have made significant progress nationwide, and the overall economic situation is improving. This is evident in the following ways: the continuous overheating of the economy over the past few years has cooled down; the high industrial growth rates of previous years have, on a national and annual basis, dropped to a more reasonable level; agricultural production has yielded good results; the momentum of investment and consumption demand expansion has slowed; bank loans and currency issuance have been effectively controlled, and urban and rural residents' savings have increased significantly; the monthly increase in retail prices has decreased, and the prices of some commodities have even stabilized or fallen, alleviating the public's anxiety about price increases. These facts prove that the series of rectification measures focused on controlling demand and adjusting the structure, adopted by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, have already, are, and will continue to play an active role. The national economy is moving towards a virtuous cycle. Both underestimating and overestimating the initial achievements of rectification are inappropriate. It must be recognized that the fundamental factors causing inflation have not been eliminated, and the deep-seated problems affecting economic stability have not been fundamentally resolved.

The conference believed that next year is a crucial year for rectification and deepening reform. Whether China's economy can truly achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development in the future depends on whether, under the premise of controlling total demand, the economic structure can be significantly improved and economic efficiency significantly enhanced. Adjusting the structure and improving efficiency are much more difficult than controlling demand and reducing speed. In this sense, next year marks the tough stage of China's rectification. How to face the difficulties in rectification is a severe test for leaders at all levels. The attendees believed that the key is to have a good mental state. One must be determined to push forward with rectification, while also studying new situations, overcoming new difficulties, and solving new problems, thereby advancing economic work. This is the correct attitude we should adopt. The attendees firmly believed that although China's economy faces many difficulties, there are also many favorable conditions for overcoming them. After a period of hard work, the unstable factors in the economy will gradually be eliminated, and the economy will emerge from the difficulties and move towards healthy development.

After discussion, the conference clarified the guiding ideology for next year's economic work. The tasks for next year's economic work are complex and arduous. The overall guiding ideology is to actively promote rectification and deepen reform while maintaining social stability. Social stability and rectification are complementary. Without social stability, rectification cannot proceed smoothly. Without effective rectification, overall stability is difficult to achieve. Next year's economic work must establish the idea of advancing towards the goals of rectification and deepening reform; the idea that all aspects must truly tighten their belts; the idea of considering comprehensive coordination and looking ahead; the idea of maintaining overall stability during rectification; and the idea of closely linking rectification with reform and opening up, ensuring the stability and continuity of reform and opening-up policies. All regions, departments, and industries must focus their thoughts and work on rectification and deepening reform.

The conference required all regions, departments, and industries to focus on the following tasks next year:

1. **Strengthen Agriculture**: Strive for a good harvest of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. Both central and local governments should increase investment in agriculture; continue the specialized management of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films, and improve it according to actual conditions; promote "Science and Technology for Agriculture," actively popularize practical agricultural science and technology achievements that require less investment and yield significant results; further stabilize and improve the rural household contract responsibility system, develop various forms of agricultural service systems, and gradually establish a sound dual-management system; guide farmers to increase investment in agriculture, organize farmers to build water conservancy projects and improve farmland, and increase labor accumulation; actively guide township enterprises to develop healthily according to the principles of adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement.

2. **Ensure Industrial Production**: Maintain moderate growth in industrial production. Focus on adjusting product structures and improving economic efficiency; take effective measures to ensure the production of large and medium-sized enterprises that are crucial to the national economy and have good economic benefits; strive to activate circulation and ensure smooth commodity flow; strengthen the management of important production materials to meet the needs of key national production and construction; and improve the organization and coordination of industrial production.

3. **Diversify Production and Services**: Actively explore new avenues for production, diversified operations, and services to arrange for the unemployed; strictly strengthen market price management, control the increase in prices next year, stabilize the market, and arrange for people's livelihoods; adhere to the policy of tightening, continue to reduce the scale of fixed asset investment, adjust the investment structure, strictly control the scale of loans and currency issuance, reasonably adjust the credit structure, increase revenue and reduce expenditures, oppose waste, and practice thrift; strive to increase exports and reduce imports to maintain a balance in foreign exchange; pay attention to the development of science and education, and strictly control population growth.

The conference emphasized that rectification and deepening reform are complementary and should not be separated or opposed to each other. Rectification should create conditions for the deepening and healthy development of reform, and reform should serve the goals of rectification. The conference reiterated that the household contract responsibility system in rural areas will not change, the enterprise contract responsibility system will not change, the factory director responsibility system will not change, the policy of developing various economic components under the premise of maintaining public ownership will not change, the financial contract system between the central and local governments will not change, and the policy of introducing advanced technology, utilizing foreign capital, and attracting foreign investment will not change. The basic policies and measures for economic special zones and coastal open areas will not change. In summary, during the period of rectification, various reform and opening-up measures should be enriched and improved on the basis of maintaining policy stability and continuity, in accordance with the principle of eliminating evils and promoting benefits, so that rectification and reform and opening up can complement each other to ensure and promote the stable development of China's economy.

The conference stressed that the economy is the foundation, and politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. Doing a good job in next year's economic work is crucial for stabilizing the economic situation, maintaining political stability, and ensuring social stability. China is a unified country, and China's economy is a unified economy. The matters decided by the Party Central Committee and the State Council must be earnestly implemented by all localities and departments, without any discounting or arbitrary actions. The conference required all regions, departments, and industries to strengthen the overall concept, consciously maintain the overall and national interests, improve work styles, and ensure that all economic work tasks are implemented.

    国务院计划财政工作会议分析形势部署明年工作
    我国经济正向好的方向发展
    明年经济工作总的指导思想是：在保持社会稳定的前提下，积极推进治理整顿和深化改革
    李鹏姚依林听取汇报并作重要讲话
    新华社北京12月17日电　（记者徐耀中）国务院新近召开了全国计划会议和全国财政工作会议，根据党的十三届五中全会的精神，本着认真贯彻进一步治理整顿和深化改革的方针，具体部署了1990年的经济工作。会议要求各级领导、广大干部和职工，振奋精神，增强信心，扎扎实实地做好明年的经济工作，使国民经济保持平稳发展。
    会议期间，国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林听取一些省、市、自治区负责人的汇报并作了重要讲话。吴学谦、李铁映、秦基伟、王丙乾、邹家华、陈希同、罗干等国务院领导同志出席了会议。
    会议分析了我国目前的经济形势。会议认为，经过一年来的努力工作，在全国范围内治理整顿和深化改革取得了比较明显的进展，整个经济情况正在向好的方向发展。突出表现在连续几年的经济过热已经降温；前些年持续过高的工业增长速度，就全国和全年来看，已经降到比较合理的水平；农业生产获得较好收成；投资需求和消费需求膨胀的势头有所减缓；银行贷款规模和货币投放得到有效控制，城乡居民储蓄有了较大的增长；零售物价上涨幅度逐月降低，一些商品的价格甚至稳中有降，广大群众对涨价的紧张心理已基本消除。这些事实证明，党中央、国务院采取的以控制需求、调整结构为重点的一系列治理整顿措施，已经、正在、并将继续发挥积极作用，国民经济正朝着良性循环的方向发展。对治理整顿所取得的初步成效，既不能估计不足，也不能估计过高。必须看到，导致通货膨胀的一些基本因素尚未消除，影响经济稳定的一些深层次问题还没有从根本上得到解决。
    会议认为，明年是治理整顿和深化改革的关键性一年。我国的经济今后能否真正实现持续、稳定、协调发展，根本的问题是能否在坚持压缩总需求的前提下，使经济结构有明显改善，经济效益有明显提高。调整结构和提高效益要比压缩需求、降低速度困难得多。从这个意义上讲，明年我国的治理整顿进入了攻坚的阶段。如何对待治理整顿面临的困难，对各级领导干部是一次严峻考验。到会同志认为，关键是要有一个好的精神状态。要知难而进，坚定不移地推进治理整顿，同时注意研究新的情况、克服新的困难、解决新的问题，从而把经济工作推向前进，这是我们应该采取的正确态度。出席会议的同志们深信，尽管我国经济确实遇到不少困难，但是也有许多克服困难的有利条件，在经过一段艰苦的工作以后，经济中的不稳定因素一定会逐步消除，整个经济会从困难中走出来，走上健康发展的坦途。
    会议经过讨论，明确了明年经济工作的指导思想。明年经济工作的任务是复杂的和艰巨的。总的指导思想是，在保持社会稳定的前提下，积极推进治理整顿和深化改革。社会稳定和治理整顿是相辅相成的。社会不稳定，治理整顿难以顺利进行。不搞好治理整顿，大局也难以稳定。明年的经济工作，必须树立向治理整顿深化改革目标前进一步的思想；树立各方面都要真正过紧日子的思想；树立注意统筹兼顾、瞻前顾后的思想；树立在治理整顿中注意稳定大局的思想；树立把治理整顿和改革开放紧密结合起来的思想，保持改革开放政策的稳定性与连续性。各地区、各部门、各行各业都要把思想和工作切实转到治理整顿和深化改革上来。
    会议要求各地区、各部门、各行各业明年要着重抓好下列几项工作：
    切实加强农业，力争粮食棉花等主要农产品有一个好收成。明年从中央到地方都要增加对农业的投入；坚持化肥、农药、农膜等农业生产资料的专营工作，并结合实际情况加以改进；做好“科技兴农”，积极推广那些花钱较少、增产显著的实用农业科技成果；进一步稳定和完善农村家庭联产承包责任制，发展各种形式的农业服务体系，逐步建立健全双层经营体制；积极引导农民增加对农业的投入，组织农民兴修水利和整治农田，增加劳动积累；认真按照调整、整顿、改造、提高的方针，积极引导乡镇企业健康发展。全国上下、各行各业都要动员起来，大力支援农业，齐心合力办好农业，力争明年农业比今年有一个更好的收成，结束农业连续几年的徘徊局面。
    从各个方面采取积极措施，努力保持工业生产的适度增长。搞好明年的工业生产，一要切实把工业生产的重点放到调整产品结构和提高经济效益上来。二要采取多种有效措施，把关系国计民生的经济效益好的大中型企业的生产保上去。三要千方百计搞活流通，使货畅其流。四要加强对重要生产资料的经营管理，以保证国家重点生产建设的需要。五要搞好对工业生产的组织领导和调度。
    此外还要积极开拓生产、多种经营和服务门路，努力安排待业人员；严格加强市场物价管理，控制明年物价上涨幅度，稳定市场，安排好人民生活；坚持紧缩方针，继续压缩固定资产投资规模、调整投资结构，继续严格控制信贷规模和货币发行、合理调整信贷结构，大力增收节支，反对浪费、厉行节约；努力增加出口、压缩进口，保持外汇收支平衡；重视科学和教育事业的发展，严格控制人口增长。
    会议着重指出，治理整顿和深化改革是相辅相成的，不应该把它们割裂开来，更不应该对立起来，而应该把它们很好地结合起来。治理整顿要为改革的深入和健康发展创造条件，改革要为实现治理整顿的目标服务。会议重申，农村实行家庭联产承包责任制不变，企业承包责任制不变，厂长负责制不变，在坚持公有制为主体的前提下发展多种经济成份的政策不变，中央对地方实行财政包干的体制不变，继续引进先进技术、利用外资和吸引外商来华投资等对外开放政策不变，经济特区和沿海开放地区的基本政策措施不变。总之，在治理整顿期间，要在保持政策稳定性和连续性的基础上，本着兴利除弊的原则，对各项改革开放措施进行充实和完善，使治理整顿和改革开放相互配合，以保证和促进我国经济的稳定发展。
    会议强调指出：经济是基础，政治是经济的集中表现。做好明年的经济工作，对于稳定经济全局，保持政治稳定和社会安定，都有至关重要的意义。中国是统一的国家，中国的经济是统一的经济。党中央、国务院定下来的事，各地方、各部门一定要尽力做好，不能打折扣，不能各行其是。会议要求，各地区、各部门、各行各业加强全局观念，自觉地维护全局利益、全国利益，认真改进工作作风，把各项经济工作任务落到实处。
