In 1848, Marx and Engels published "The Communist Manifesto." In this first programmatic document of scientific socialism, the leaders of the proletarian revolution summarized the theory of communists in one sentence: the abolition of private ownership. Over the past century and a half, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the proletariat of various countries has waged a great struggle to abolish private ownership and establish public ownership, which has become an irreversible historical trend.

The Chinese Communist Party, guided by Marxism, has led the Chinese people on the inevitable path of historical development. After completing the tasks of the new democratic revolution, they achieved the socialist transformation of the means of production, abolished the system of exploitation and the exploiting class, and established a socialist system with public ownership as the mainstay. In 40 years of socialist practice in China, the Chinese people have deeply understood that socialist public ownership is the foundation of the socialist system. In the current stage, adhering to socialism fundamentally means adhering to the dominant position of socialist public ownership. Otherwise, the direction of China's socialist construction and reform will change, and the achievements of the people will be in jeopardy.

For this reason, since the day "The Communist Manifesto" was published, all exploiting classes and their spokesmen have attacked the communists' theory of abolishing private ownership. After the appearance of socialist public ownership on the horizon, the hostile forces of socialism have always attempted to shake the foundation of public ownership, the basis of the socialist system.

In recent years, international reactionary forces have intensified their strategy of "peaceful evolution" against socialist countries. In China, a few stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization have also stirred up a clamor for "privatization," attempting to change the direction of Chinese socialism by changing public ownership to private ownership. Under this international and domestic climate, "China's Hope—The Declaration of Private Ownership" (hereinafter referred to as "The Declaration") emerged at the beginning of the turmoil in April this year. The authors of "The Declaration" fabricated ten major crimes of public ownership, claiming that China's public ownership "violated the laws of historical development," "constrained the development of productive forces in the economy," "led to tremendous waste," "suppressed the efficiency of labor," "restricted the development of individual potential," and caused "short-term behavior and immediate gains." In politics, it became "the soil for bureaucratism," "the breeding ground for corruption," and "the cradle of authoritarianism," slandering that "there is no true democracy and freedom under public ownership." Finally, the authors of "The Declaration" revealed their true intentions, declaring that "without removing this root of evil, China will not have true democracy and freedom, nor will it become prosperous and strong," openly inciting people to "ring the death knell of public ownership as soon as possible."

At this point, "The Declaration" openly advocates the capitalist road, exposing its true face. It is a necessary product of the recent surge in privatization ideology, reflecting the views and strategies of a small number of stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization in China, and revealing the political and economic programs of the instigators of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the spring and summer. Criticizing this anti-Marxist, anti-historical declaration and eliminating the harmful effects of the privatization tide is an important task on the current ideological and theoretical front.

Why China was able to replace private ownership with socialist public ownership

The first accusation made by the authors of "The Declaration" against public ownership is that "public ownership violated the laws of historical development." This forces us to answer: why was China able to replace private ownership with socialist public ownership? Was the establishment of public ownership in China a violation of the laws of historical development, or was it a necessary result of historical development?

According to Marxism's theory of social development, the five social forms of primitive society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society, and communist society generally succeed each other in order. However, semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, why did it skip the stage of fully developed capitalism and directly transition from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution? Was this, as the authors of "The Declaration" claim, a violation of the laws of historical development? Anyone with basic knowledge of Marxism and modern Chinese history knows that making such a judgment, if not confused, is certainly malicious.

After the Opium War, due to the invasion of imperialism, feudal China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, poor, and backward country. Imperialist powers, in order to plunder raw materials, dump commodities, and obtain cheap labor, competed to build ports, railways, factories, and businesses in China, thereby objectively stimulating the development of Chinese national capitalism to a certain extent, creating the Chinese bourgeoisie and proletariat, and giving birth to new productive forces. The old productive relations became a serious obstacle to the development of new productive forces, and the sharp contradictions between nations and classes made social revolution an inevitable trend that could not be changed by anyone's will. Who is the representative of the new productive forces and the leader of the social revolution? History has proven that the Chinese big bourgeoisie is not, as it can only survive by relying on international capitalist forces. The Chinese national bourgeoisie, due to the fragility of its economic position and the weakness of its political attitude, could not carry out a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution to build China into a developed capitalist country. The task of the new democratic social revolution fell historically on the shoulders of the Chinese working class, the social force representing the development of new productive forces. This is the most important basis and condition for the spread and development of Marxism-Leninism in China, the growth of the Communist Party of China, and the ultimate victory of the proletarian revolution. The victory of the people's revolution in China is ultimately the result of the inevitable development of the contradiction between productive forces and productive relations, and the result of the development of Chinese society.

After the victory of the Chinese revolution, the People's Republic was established on the ruins of old China, with a very low level of productive forces. However, does this mean that, as the authors of "The Declaration" claim, China's choice of socialist public ownership at the beginning of its establishment was a violation of the laws of historical development?

From a theoretical point of view, such a claim is untenable. From a practical point of view, China was able to choose socialist public ownership at the beginning of its establishment and did not take the capitalist road, which was determined by the domestic and international environment at that time. At that time, bureaucratic comprador capital accounted for 66% of the country's industrial capital and 80% of the fixed assets of the country's mines, transportation, and communications. If we allowed the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie to continue to control the economic lifeline of the country, we would not be able to smash the power of imperialism in China and fundamentally change the fate of a colonial and semi-colonial country. Except for turning all bureaucratic capital into socialist public ownership, we had no other choice. The state-owned economy of New China was socialist from the beginning. Relying on the support of a powerful state-owned economy, we were able to implement the unification of national finance and economy, concentrate the forces that could be concentrated, overcome the serious difficulties faced, maintain the hard-won unity and security of the country, and begin to restore and develop the national economy in an orderly and step-by-step manner. At that time, national capitalist industry and commerce had their positive role, but if we had not implemented the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming it at the beginning of the establishment of the country, class oppression and class exploitation would not have been eliminated, and the socialist system would not have been established and consolidated. Similarly, if we had not implemented the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, the backward and scattered small-scale production would not have been able to meet the needs of socialized large-scale production, liberate the productive forces, and there would be no way to talk about national economic construction, especially industrialization. Although there were various shortcomings and deficiencies in specific work, overall, it was precisely because our party adopted the correct guiding ideology and basic policies that we were able to basically complete the socialist transformation of the means of production in just seven years, establish the socialist public ownership system, and successfully lead China onto the path of socialist development.

The authors of "The Declaration" claim that due to the high level of people's ideological awareness being "a false assumption," even today public ownership is still "based on a wrong premise." This statement is not only a distortion and falsification of Marxism-Leninism but also a slander against the people who have devoted themselves to the construction of material and spiritual civilization. Marxists have never relied on empty imagination to depict future society but have "discovered the new world in the criticism of the old world." Their ideas about the "new world" are strictly based on the objective laws of the development of productive forces. As Engels said, "The ultimate cause of all social changes and political revolutions is not to be sought in men's minds, in men's increasing knowledge of eternal truth and justice, but in the changes in the modes of production and exchange." This clearly shows that the socialist public ownership proposed by Marxism is based on the objective economic laws, not on the level of people's ideological awareness. The authors of "The Declaration" avoid talking about the economic base and only talk about ideological awareness, and falsely claim that the improvement of people's ideological awareness is a fabricated assumption, which is nothing but a despicable trick used to deny socialist public ownership.

China's leap from the new democratic society to the socialist society is also an example of the leapfrog development of history predicted by Marxism. World history shows that the historical development of various countries is extremely complex. Due to different specific conditions, leapfrog development in history is not uncommon. For example, after the dissolution of the primitive commune, Greece, Rome, and other countries established developed slave societies according to the general laws of human social development, while the Germanic people entering the countries along the Danube River did not establish a slave society but directly established the feudal serf system. Again, for example, most European countries experienced the medieval feudal society, while the United States skipped the feudal society and directly established a capitalist society.

China's leap over the capitalist historical stage after its establishment and the establishment of the socialist system is the inevitable result of historical development, not the subjective imagination of anyone. The authors of "The Declaration" advocate the "theory of leapfrogging" only to provide a theoretical basis for their attempt to "ring the death knell of public ownership as soon as possible."

Is public ownership a restraint on the development of productive forces, or has it greatly liberated the productive forces?

Another accusation made by the authors of "The Declaration" against public ownership is that "public ownership restrains the development of productive forces." They say that because "everyone is the master of the state under public ownership," it "suppresses the efficiency of labor," "restricts the development of individual potential," and after 40 years of building the country, "the people are still suffering."

Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. Let us use the 40 years of socialist practice to test whether public ownership has greatly liberated the productive forces or "restrained the development of productive forces."

After the founding of New China, in just 40 years, due to the establishment of a socialist system with public ownership of the means of production as its foundation, industrial and agricultural production has developed comprehensively, and comprehensive national strength has been greatly enhanced. In 1988, the national gross product was 12 times that at the beginning of the establishment of the country, the original value of industrial fixed assets increased by about 50 times compared to 1949, and the proportion of industrial output value in the total social output value increased from 25% at the beginning of the establishment of the country to 61%. We have basically solved the problem of subsistence for 1.1 billion people with our own strength. With the development of the economy, the material and cultural living standards of urban and rural people have been significantly improved.

Practice has proven that there is a vast difference between old and new China in terms of social and economic development levels. Socialist public ownership has greatly liberated the productive forces. Of course, if we could have avoided the "Great Leap Forward" in 1958 and the major mistakes of neglecting or even destroying the development of productive forces during the "Cultural Revolution," our achievements would have been even greater, and the superiority of the socialist system would have been more fully demonstrated.

Why has socialist public ownership been able to promote the development of social productive forces in China?

First, socialist public ownership ensures the strong internal driving force for the development of socialist production. Capitalist private ownership determines that the motive and purpose of capitalist production are for the capitalist to seize the maximum profit. This system places the laborer in a position of being oppressed and exploited, so the driving force of labor production is inevitably limited. Socialist public ownership abolishes the system of exploitation, and the social status of laborers has undergone a fundamental change. The socialist system not only pays attention to the interests of the state and the collective but also pays attention to individual interests, with both political and economic driving forces, so the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of laborers must be fully brought into play. The authors of "The Declaration" claim that under public ownership, laborers "want others to work more and themselves to earn more money," "grab what they can when they can," etc., which only exposes the authors' extremely selfish and ugly mentality and slanders the billions of laborers.

Second, public ownership of the means of production enables the state, representing the people, to arrange production through overall planning, develop production in a planned and proportional manner, and, under limited national strength, relatively concentrate funds to carry out key construction, promoting the continuous, stable, and coordinated development of social production.

It is well known that New China began large-scale economic construction with the First Five-Year Plan after only a three-year period of national economic recovery. Under the extremely weak economic foundation at that time, only public ownership could relatively concentrate the country's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to ensure the completion of approximately 10,000 projects (including 694 large projects) within five years, laying the initial foundation for China's socialist industrialization. It is also because we have always adhered to the dominant position of socialist public ownership and the leading position of the state-owned economy that we have been able to establish an independent and relatively complete modern industrial system in just 40 years, achieving the initial prosperity and strength of the socialist motherland. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, starting from the actual situation that China is still in the primary stage of socialism, we have consciously adjusted and improved the ownership structure and economic operation mechanism through reform, adopting a socialist ownership structure with public ownership as the mainstay and the coexistence of various economic components. In the public ownership economy, we have also adopted various operating methods. In the entire national economy, we have implemented an economic operation and adjustment mechanism that combines planning and market regulation. In this way, we can avoid blind development of the national economy and avoid over-concentration of the economy. In the 10 years since the reform, the national economy has developed rapidly, per capita national income has doubled, and the superiority of socialist public ownership has been more fully demonstrated. This self-adjusting and self-improving ability is something that capitalist private ownership can never possess.

Under capitalist private ownership, social production is in a state of anarchy, and the contradiction between the blind expansion of production and the relative reduction of the demand of the broad laboring masses with purchasing power will inevitably lead to economic stagnation and regression, and even the outbreak of economic crises of overproduction. The disastrous burden of economic crises is ultimately shifted to the laboring people, and the seeds of the outbreak of economic crises are sown again. When economic crises occur, the capitalist system, though forced to make certain adjustments, will never touch the root of all evil, private ownership itself. This contradiction can only be solved by replacing private ownership with public ownership.

The authors of "The Declaration" close their eyes to the great economic development and comprehensive social progress brought about by our adherence to and improvement of socialist public ownership over the past 40 years, and do not mention a word about the obstacles of capitalist private ownership to the development of productive forces. This only shows that they are devout worshippers of capitalist private ownership and stubborn opponents of socialist public ownership. Their vision is short-sighted, and they are not even as good as bourgeois economists. The American economist Joseph Schumpeter said: "Can capitalism survive? No, I do not think so... The success of this system itself will destroy the social institutions that protect it and will inevitably create conditions under which this system cannot survive, and socialism may take its place." In Schumpeter's eyes, capitalist private ownership is not as beautiful and pleasant as described by those who stubbornly advocate bourgeois liberalization.

Third, socialist public ownership abolishes the exploitative relations under private ownership, making it possible to gradually realize the principle of distribution according to labor and more labor, more pay. According to the principle of distribution according to labor, labor is both a measure of the laborer's contribution to society and a measure of the distribution of personal consumption goods, which greatly promotes the initiative of laborers. Public ownership and distribution according to labor eliminate the soil for the polarization of the rich and the poor under private ownership, enabling all the people to walk the road of common prosperity, and the living standards improve with the development of production. We do not deny that in the current social and economic life, there are still many places where the phenomenon of "eating from the same pot" exists, and certain departments and units have low production efficiency, engage in short-term behavior, waste severely, and the personal potential of laborers is not fully brought into play. However, the appearance of these problems has no necessary connection with socialist public ownership, but it also reflects that our socialist public ownership economy is not perfect, and some practices in real life are not in line with public ownership, and socialist and communist ideological education has not been carried out for the staff. We carry out socialist reform to perfect the realization form of socialist public ownership, eliminate those problems that should not appear and are not inherent in socialism. In the economic system reform, we have achieved and will continue to achieve results, and socialist public ownership will be further perfected. The authors of "The Declaration" attack public ownership, which is completely futile.

Is the true guarantee of democracy and freedom public ownership or private ownership?

The authors of "The Declaration" curse public ownership as "the cradle of authoritarianism," "the breeding ground for corruption," and "the soil for bureaucratism," slandering that under the public ownership system, "there is no freedom to organize and develop according to one's own will," and "there is no basic right to choose," therefore, "without removing this root of evil, China will not have true democracy and freedom."

According to the logic of the authors of "The Declaration," since socialist public ownership suppresses their democracy and freedom, they can only seek capitalist private ownership to protect their democracy and freedom. Are capitalist countries really such "paradises"? Absolutely not. The resource-based gold money rule of the bourgeoisie, based on private ownership, is necessarily the breeding ground for corruption and bureaucratism, so various bribery, corruption, and political scandals, as well as mutual backstabbing, sabotage, and delayed operation of state agencies, are naturally common. More importantly, the bourgeois dictatorship maintained by capitalist private ownership is essentially the dictatorship of a few rich people over the majority of the poor. In capitalist countries, democracy and freedom are indeed real for the rich, but they are false for the laboring people. Democracy, as a political system, is produced on a certain economic base and serves the economic base. Under the capitalist private ownership system, no matter how the bourgeois democratic system develops, it ultimately serves to guarantee the ruling position and ruling order of the bourgeoisie. The exploited and oppressed wage laborers, where is their "freedom to organize and develop according to their own will," and where is their "right to choose"? The parties and organizations declared illegal or banned by capitalist countries are not a few, and the so-called right to choose is only the privilege of the capitalists. Those who stubbornly advocate bourgeois liberalization, who are fond of talking about the election system of bourgeois countries, seem to think that this is the true democracy and freedom. In fact, under the condition that the monopoly bourgeoisie owns the vast majority of the means of production and social wealth, the so-called universal suffrage is only to ensure that the monopoly bourgeoisie can select their own political representatives to replace themselves to manage the country. Every few years of elections are genuine money elections, and every administration is only for the service of maintaining the rule of the monopoly oligarchs. The bourgeois democratic and freedom system is ultimately a fig leaf to cover the bourgeois dictatorship. This fact shows that only under the condition of public ownership of the means of production, the people can enjoy extensive and real democratic and freedom rights.

In China, replacing private ownership with socialist public ownership is a profound revolution. The establishment and development of public ownership of the means of production, the abolition of the exploiting class and the system of exploitation, have made all the people the masters of the new country and the new society, truly masters of the house, enjoying the extensive power to manage the country's economy, culture, and social affairs by law. This is fundamentally different from bourgeois democracy and all democracies based on private ownership. Therefore, the process of China's people replacing the social form based on private ownership with socialist public ownership is necessarily a process of continuously strengthening and developing socialist democracy.

In the 40 years since the founding of the country, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the socialist democratic political system has been gradually strengthened, and the system of people's congresses and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party have been continuously improved. The people exercise the power to manage the country through the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at various levels elected by themselves. Various basic democratic systems and democratic supervision systems in society are becoming more and more perfect. Through this series of basic political systems and democratic systems, the broad masses of the people actively participate in the management of the country and political life. With the development of socialist democracy and the improvement of socialist legal system, China's socialist democratic politics are gradually moving towards institutionalization and legalization, and the various rights enjoyed by the people are effectively protected by law. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China clearly states that "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people," which is being realized in various fields of society. The authors of "The Declaration" ignore this reality, which only shows that they stand on the anti-socialist and anti-people position.

It must be admitted that there are indeed negative phenomena such as corruption and bureaucratism in our society. The reason for the existence of these negative phenomena is, first, because our society is born from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and the old traces have not been completely eliminated. Second, China is now in the primary stage of socialism, and the socialist productive relations are not perfect in some aspects, and there are still some defects in specific management systems, organizational forms, and working methods. Corruption, bureaucratism, and other phenomena are precisely what we must resolutely correct, and adhering to socialist public ownership is an important guarantee for us to correct these evils. In countries with private ownership, the phenomenon of official corruption is more widespread and serious. This fact also proves that corruption has no necessary connection with public ownership.

Where is China's true hope?

The authors of "The Declaration" put "China's Hope" before the title of their declaration to deceive people and sell their tricks. However, the Chinese people, who have suffered the humiliation and exploitation of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, deeply understand that private ownership is the root of all evil. When the means of production are owned by the exploiting class, Chinese society can only be in a state of economic decline, social chaos, and cultural backwardness for a long time, and the laboring people can only be like cattle and horses, subject to the manipulation and slaughter of others. If we do not adhere to the dominant position of socialist public ownership, but return to the capitalist road as advocated by the authors of "The Declaration," it will inevitably lead to the polarization of the rich and the poor. While using the blood and sweat of the laboring people to cultivate and fatten a "middle class" again, the majority of social members will once again become the slaves of both foreign capital and the domestic exploiting class. This is something that the Chinese people will never accept. Private ownership is not the hope of China, as concluded by Chinese history.

China's true hope lies in adhering to socialist public ownership and making socialist public ownership more perfect through deepening reform. Only in this way can the prosperity of the economy and the progress of society be guaranteed, and the position of the people as masters of the house can be consolidated. It must be admitted that the socialist public ownership in the current stage is not perfect. However, it must also be seen that any new type of ownership form, from its initial establishment to its final perfection, must go through a historical process. Capitalist private ownership has been around for hundreds of years, although the essence of private ownership of the means of production has not changed, but its specific implementation forms have undergone several changes and adjustments. Socialist public ownership has been established in China for less than 40 years, expecting it to be perfect immediately is unrealistic. It should also be seen that the operation mechanism of public ownership is different from that of private ownership. Private ownership mainly relies on the inherent economic laws to spontaneously drive social production, while public ownership is guided by scientific foresight to drive social production, subject to various factors, and it is difficult to make the foresight scientific and accurate. Some mistakes are inevitable. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, there was indeed a relatively long period when we had deviations in our understanding and mistakes in our work regarding the ownership issue, subjectively adding many principles that are not the essential attributes of socialist public ownership. For example, we emphasized the "one big, two publics" of the ownership structure one-sidedly, making the change of productive relations transcend the level of development of China's productive forces. Again, for example, we regarded the highly centralized administrative management of the economy and the state's direct management of enterprises as the only model for the realization of socialist public ownership, excluding the market mechanism and denying the production and operation autonomy of enterprises. These deviations and mistakes, to a certain extent, weakened the internal vitality of the public ownership economy and failed to fully demonstrate the superiority of socialist public ownership.

Seriously summing up historical experience will help us deepen our understanding of socialist public ownership. Understanding the long-term and arduous nature of the development and perfection of socialist public ownership will strengthen our belief in adhering to public ownership and avoid the deviation of seeking quick results and constant changes in the reform. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Committee, starting from the basic national conditions that China is in the primary stage of socialism, has made many important reforms and active explorations regarding the ownership structure in the current stage of socialism and the realization form of socialist public ownership. On the one hand, under the premise that the public ownership economy occupies the dominant position, it allows the development of individual and private economies in sectors and industries with a low degree of socialization of production, and allows the establishment of joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises as a necessary supplement to the socialist public ownership economy. On the other hand, it is committed to reforming the overly centralized economic management system, achieving the appropriate separation of ownership and management rights, and making the public ownership economy adapt to the requirements of the development of socialist planned commodity economy. These have promoted the great development of production.

The practice of 10 years of reform has proven that the ownership structure with public ownership as the mainstay and the coexistence of various economic components is suitable for China's national conditions and the level of development of productive forces. The practice of reform has also proven that socialist public ownership has very rich connotations and various realization forms, and public ownership and commodity economy are completely compatible. As long as we adopt scientific and reasonable realization forms of public ownership, public ownership enterprises can be more efficient, more full of vitality and vitality.

All descendants of the Yellow Emperor who are eager for the prosperity and strength of the motherland know that adhering to and improving socialist public ownership is the true hope of China. However, the authors of "The Declaration" say that the "children of the motherland" do not want to be masters at home and everyone wants to go abroad, and some are even willing to be "third-class citizens" of others. This is a complete lie. Because the vast majority of the Chinese people currently studying and working abroad are patriotic and eager to devote themselves to the cause of national construction. All those who are determined to revive China should have the great ambition to build the motherland with their own hands, making the motherland stand tall and proud in the forest of nations forever.

In summary, the economic system reform we are carrying out is to perfect and develop public ownership on the premise of adhering to socialist public ownership, and it is absolutely not to negate or weaken socialist public ownership. It is absolutely not allowed to privatize. If, like the authors of "The Declaration," we regard socialist public ownership as a "source of evil" and regard capitalist private ownership as the ultimate goal, and dismantle the state-owned economy, which has a high degree of socialization, maintains the livelihood of the people, and is related to the security of the country, for private ownership, the result will inevitably destroy the foundation of socialized large-scale production, cause great chaos in the national economy and social polarization, and ultimately lead to the great destruction of productive forces and social turmoil. Sacrificing the fundamental interests of the broad laboring people and returning to the capitalist road is precisely the crux of the authors of "The Declaration" and their advocates shouting to "ring the death knell of public ownership as soon as possible." The Chinese Communist Party, which takes seeking the greatest interests of the people as its struggle goal, and the socialist society, which takes the laboring people as the masters of the state, can allow such a historical tragedy to be repeated? Absolutely not. The Chinese people, who have been tempered by blood and fire, will continue to march forward unshakably on the socialist road they have chosen.

    评《私有制宣言》
    金建
     一个鼓吹资本主义道路的宣言
    1848年，马克思、恩格斯发表了《共产党宣言》。在这份科学社会主义的第一个纲领性文献中，无产阶级革命导师把共产党人的理论概括为一句话：消灭私有制。一个半世纪以来，在共产党的领导下，各国无产者为消灭私有制、建立公有制的伟大斗争，已经成为不可逆转的历史潮流。
    以马克思主义为指导思想的中国共产党人，领导中国人民走历史发展的必由之路。在完成新民主主义革命的任务后，实现了生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，消灭了剥削制度和剥削阶级，建立了以生产资料公有制为主体的社会主义制度。在中国社会主义四十年的实践中，中国人民深深懂得，社会主义公有制是社会主义制度的基础。在现阶段，坚持社会主义，从根本上说，就是要坚持社会主义公有制的主体地位。否则我国社会主义建设和改革的方向就要改变，人民取得的成果就有付诸东流的危险。
    正因为如此，从《共产党宣言》发表的那一天起，一切剥削阶级及其代言人莫不攻击共产党人的消灭私有制的理论；当社会主义公有制在地平线上出现以后，社会主义的敌对势力又总是图谋撼动公有制这个社会主义制度的基础。
    近年来，国际反动势力加紧对社会主义国家推行“和平演变”的战略，我国国内顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人也掀起了一股“私有化”的喧嚣，企图把改变公有制为私有制作为改变中国社会主义方向的突破口。在这种国际大气候和国内小气候下，《中国的希望——私有制宣言》（下称《宣言》）在今年四月动乱之初出笼了。《宣言》炮制者罗织了公有制的十大罪状，胡说我国的公有制“超前了历史发展的规律”，在经济上“约束着生产力的发展”，“导致惊人的浪费”，“抑制了效率的发挥”，“限制了个人潜能的发挥”，造成“短期行为、急功近利”，在政治上则成为“产生官僚主义的土壤”，“贪污腐化的温床”，“集权专制的摇篮”，诬蔑“在公有制下，不会有真正的民主、自由”。最后，《宣言》的炮制者图穷匕首见，声称“不清除公有制这一祸根，中国就不可能有真正的民主和自由，就不可能富强”，公然煽惑人们去“早日敲响公有制的丧钟”。
    至此，《宣言》鼓吹走资本主义道路的嘴脸暴露无遗，它是近年来私有化思潮泛滥的必然产物，集中反映了国内极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人的主张和策略，道出了今年春夏之交动乱和反革命暴乱制造者们的政治纲领和经济纲领的要害。对这个反马克思主义、逆历史潮流而动的《宣言》进行批驳，肃清私有化思潮的流毒，是当前思想理论战线的一项重要任务。
    我国为什么能够用社会主义公有制取代私有制
    《宣言》炮制者列举的公有制的第一条罪状，就是“公有制超前了历史发展的规律”。这就迫使我们必须回答，我国为什么能够用社会主义公有制取代私有制，公有制在中国的建立，是“超前了历史发展的规律”，还是历史发展的必然结果？
    按照马克思主义关于社会发展的学说，原始社会、奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会、共产主义社会五种社会形态一般是依次更替的。但是，半殖民地、半封建的中国，为什么跳跃了资本主义充分发展的阶段，直接由新民主主义革命转变为社会主义革命？这样是否如《宣言》炮制者所说的那样，是“超前了历史发展的规律”呢？只要具有马克思主义基本常识和中国近代历史知识的人都知道，作出这种判断，如果不是思想糊涂，便是别有用心。
    从鸦片战争以后，由于帝国主义的入侵，封建的中国逐渐沦为半殖民地半封建的、贫穷落后的国家。帝国主义列强为了掠夺原料，倾销商品，获得廉价劳动力，竞相在我国修港口、建铁路、开工厂、办商业，从而在客观上刺激了中国民族资本主义有了一定的发展，造就了中国的资产阶级和无产阶级，使中国萌发了新的生产力。旧的生产关系越来越成为新的生产力发展的严重阻碍，尖锐的民族矛盾和阶级矛盾使得社会革命成为不以任何人的意志为转移的必然趋势。那么，谁是新生产力的代表、社会革命的领导力量呢？历史证明，中国的大资产阶级不是，它除了依附于国际资本势力，便无法生存下去。中国的民族资产阶级由于其经济地位的脆弱性和政治态度的软弱性，也不可能进行彻底的反帝反封建的革命，把中国建成发达的资本主义国家。新民主主义社会革命的重任，历史地落在了中国工人阶级这支代表新生产力发展的社会力量肩上。这是马克思列宁主义能够在中国传播发展，中国共产党能够产生壮大，无产阶级革命能够最终取得胜利的最重要的根据和条件。人民革命在中国的胜利，归根到底是生产力与生产关系矛盾运动发展的必然结果，是中国社会发展的必然结果。
    中国革命胜利后，人民共和国是在旧中国的烂摊子上建立起来的，生产力水平十分低下。然而，是否根据这一点，就可以像《宣言》炮制者断言的那样，我国建国之初选择了社会主义公有制是超前了历史发展的规律呢？
    从前述理论上说，这样的论断是站不住脚的。从实践上说，建国初期中国能够选择社会主义公有制，而没有走资本主义道路，这是由当时国内、国际环境所决定的。当时，官僚买办资本占有全国工业资本的66％，全国工矿、交通运输固定资产的80％。如果允许官僚买办资产阶级继续把持国家经济命脉，我们就不可能摧垮帝国主义在中国的势力，彻底改变殖民地半殖民地的命运。除了将全部官僚资本改变为社会主义公有制经济外，我们别无选择。新中国的国营经济一开始就是社会主义经济。凭借着强大的国营经济的支持，我们才能实行全国财政经济的统一，把能够集中使用的力量集中起来，战胜面临的严重困难，维护国家得来不易的统一安全，并且着手有计划有步骤地恢复和发展国民经济。当时的民族资本主义工商业有其积极作用，但如果我们在建国初期不对它实行利用、限制和改造的政策，阶级压迫和阶级剥削就不可能根除，社会主义制度也就不可能确立和巩固。同样，如果我们不对农业、手工业实行社会主义改造，落后、分散的小生产就无法适应社会化大生产的需要，解放生产力，国家经济建设特别是工业化建设也无从谈起。尽管在具体工作中有这样那样的缺点和不足，但整个说来，正是由于我们党采取了正确的指导思想和基本政策，才能够在短短七年间基本上完成对生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，确立了社会主义公有制度，从而成功地把中国引上了社会主义的发展道路。
    《宣言》炮制者振振有词地说，由于现实中人们的“思想觉悟高度提高”只是“一种虚伪的假设”，即使至今公有制仍然是“建立在错误前提下的”。这种说法不仅是对马列主义的篡改和歪曲，也是对投身于物质文明和精神文明建设的人民群众的诋毁。马克思主义者从来都不是靠凭空设想描绘未来社会，而是“在批判旧世界中发现新世界”。他们对于“新世界”的若干原则设想，是严格地依据生产力发展的客观规律提出的。正如恩格斯所说，“一切社会变迁和政治变革的终极原因，不应当在人们的头脑中，在人们对永恒的真理和正义的日益增进的认识中去寻找，而应当在生产方式和交换方式的变更中去寻找”。这就清楚地表明，马克思主义提出的社会主义公有制是建立在客观经济规律的基础上的，而不是离开客观规律，单纯建立在人们的思想觉悟的基础上的。《宣言》炮制者避口不谈经济基础，只讲思想觉悟，并且谎称人们思想觉悟的提高是一种虚构的假设，不过是为其否定社会主义公有制而采用的十分卑劣的手法。
    我国跳跃了资本主义充分发展阶段，直接由新民主主义社会转变为社会主义社会，也是马克思主义所预见到的历史的跳跃性地发展的一个例证。世界历史表明，各国的历史演进极其复杂，由于具体条件不同，历史的跳跃式发展并不罕见。例如，在原始公社解体以后，希腊、罗马等国都按照人类社会发展的一般规律，建立起发达的奴隶制国家，而日耳曼人进入多瑙河流域诸国却没有建立奴隶制国家，直接确立了封建农奴制。又例如，欧洲大多数国家都经历过中世纪的封建社会，而美国却跳越封建社会这个历史阶段，直接建立了资本主义社会。
    我国在建国后超越资本主义历史阶段，建立起社会主义制度，是历史发展的必然，决不是什么人的主观臆想。《宣言》炮制者宣扬“超前论”，只不过是为他们“早日敲响公有制的丧钟”，图谋为建立资本主义私有制制造理论根据而已。
    社会主义公有制是束缚了生产力发展，还是大大解放了生产力？
    《宣言》炮制者加给公有制的另一条罪状是，“公有制约束着生产力的发展”。他们说，由于“在公有制下，人人都是国家的主人”，因而“抑制了效率的发挥”，“限制了个人潜能的发挥”，建国40年了，“还民不聊生”。
    实践是检验真理的唯一正确的标准。让我们用社会主义四十年的实践来检验，公有制到底是大大解放了生产力，还是“约束着生产力的发展”。
    新中国成立后的短短40年中，由于建立了以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义制度，工农业生产全面发展，综合国力大大加强。1988年，国民生产总值相当于建国初期的12倍，工业固定资产原值比1949年增长50倍左右，工业产值占社会总产值的比重已由建国初期的25％上升到61％。我们依靠自己的力量基本上解决了11亿人口的温饱问题。随着经济的发展，城乡人民的物质文化生活水平显著提高。
    实践证明，新旧中国在社会经济发展水平上已有天壤之别，社会主义公有制大大地解放了生产力。当然，如果我们能够避免1958年那样急于求成的“大跃进”，能够避免“文化大革命”期间那种忽视甚至破坏发展生产力的重大失误，我们取得的成就将会更大，社会主义制度的优越性将会得到更充分的发挥。
    社会主义公有制为什么能够促进我国社会生产力的发展呢？
    第一，社会主义公有制保证了社会主义生产发展的强大内在动力。资本主义私有制决定了资本主义生产的动机和目的是资本家攫取最大限度的利润。这种制度使劳动者处于被压迫被剥削的地位，因而劳动生产的动力注定是很有限的。社会主义公有制消灭了剥削制度，劳动者的社会地位发生了根本的变化。社会主义制度既注重国家和集体的利益，又注重个人利益，既有政治动力，又有经济动力，劳动者的积极性、主动性和首创精神必定能够得到充分发挥。《宣言》炮制者胡说，在公有制下劳动者“都想让别人多干活，自己多拿钱”，“能捞先捞，不捞白不捞”等等，这只能说是炮制者极端利己主义丑恶的心态，对亿万劳动人民的诽谤。
    第二，生产资料公有制使代表人民的国家能够通过统筹安排，有计划按比例地发展生产，在国力有限的情况下，相对集中资金，进行有重点的建设，促进社会生产持续稳定协调发展。
    众所周知，新中国只经过三年国民经济恢复时期就开始了第一个五年计划的大规模经济建设。在当时经济基础非常薄弱的条件下，只有公有制才能相对集中国家的人力、物力和财力，保证在五年期间顺利建成了约一万个项目（其中大型项目达694个），为我国的社会主义工业化打下了初步的基础。也是由于我们始终坚持社会主义公有制的主体地位和国营经济的主导地位，才得以在40年不长的期间，建立起独立的、门类比较齐全的现代化工业体系，实现了社会主义祖国的初步繁荣昌盛。党的十一届三中全会以后，从我国尚处在社会主义初级阶段的实际出发，我们通过改革自觉地对所有制结构和经济运行机制逐步加以调节完善，采取了以社会主义公有制为主体、多种经济成分并存的所有制结构，在公有制经济中也采取了多种经营方式，在整个国民经济实行计划经济与市场调节相结合的经济运行和调节机制。这样，既可以避免国民经济盲目发展，又可以避免把经济统得过死。在实行改革以来的10年中，国民经济获得迅速发展，人均国民收入翻了一番，社会主义公有制的优越性得到更充分的发挥。这种自我调节、自我完善的能力，是资本主义私有制根本不可能具备的。
    在资本主义私有制下，社会生产处于无政府状态，生产的盲目扩张和广大劳动群众有支付能力的需求相对缩小的矛盾，必然导致经济的停滞和倒退，甚至爆发生产过剩的经济危机。经济危机的灾难性负担最终转嫁到劳动人民身上，又埋下经济危机再爆发的祸根。在经济危机发生的时候，资本主义制度虽能被迫作出某些调节，但决不会触动万恶之源的私有制本身。这个矛盾，只有通过公有制代替私有制才能得到解决。
    《宣言》炮制者闭眼不看40年来我们坚持和完善社会主义公有制所带来的经济巨大发展和社会全面进步，只字不提资本主义私有制对生产力发展的阻碍作用，这只能说明他们是资本主义私有制的虔诚崇拜者，是社会主义公有制的顽固反对者。他们目光短浅，连资产阶级经济学家都不如。美国经济学家熊彼得还说：“资本主义能生存下去吗？不，我认为不能……这个制度成功的本身，将破坏那些保护它的社会机构，并势必会造成这样一些条件，使这个制度不能生存下去，而社会主义很可能取而代之。”在熊彼得的眼里，资本主义私有制也并不像顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人所描绘的那么美妙动听。
    第三，社会主义公有制消灭了私有制下的剥削关系，使社会产品的分配得以逐步实现按劳分配、多劳多得的原则。根据按劳分配原则，劳动既是衡量劳动者对社会贡献的尺度，又是分配个人消费品的尺度，这就大大促进了劳动者的积极性。公有制和按劳分配，铲除了私有制下富者愈富、贫者愈贫的两极分化的土壤，使全体人民走共同富裕的道路，生活水平随着生产的发展不断提高。我们并不否认，在当前社会经济生活中，很多地方还存在吃“大锅饭”的现象，某些部门和单位确有生产效率不高、搞短期行为、浪费严重、劳动者个人潜能未能充分发挥等弊病。但是，这些问题的出现与社会主义公有制没有必然联系，但也反映出我们的社会主义公有制下的经济体制还不够完善，以及现实生活中的某些做法还同公有制不相适应，没有坚持对职工进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育。我们进行社会主义改革，就是要完善社会主义公有制的实现形式，清除那些不该出现也并非社会主义所固有的弊病。在经济体制改革中，我们已经取得并将继续取得成效，社会主义公有制必将进一步完善。《宣言》炮制者对公有制的肆意攻击，完全是徒劳的。
    民主自由的真正保障是公有制还是私有制？
    《宣言》的炮制者诅咒公有制是“集权专制的摇篮”，是“贪污腐败的温床”，是“产生官僚主义的土壤”，诬蔑在公有制度下，“没有按自己意愿组织和发展的自由”，没有“基本的选择权力”，因此，“不清除公有制这一祸根，中国就不可能有真正的民主和自由”。
    按照《宣言》炮制者的逻辑，既然社会主义公有制扼制了他们的民主和自由，那么只能寻求资本主义私有制来庇护他们的民主和自由了。资本主义国家果真是这样的“伊甸园”吗？绝对不是。建立在私有制经济基础上的资产阶级金钱统治，必然是滋生贪污腐败、官僚主义的温床，因此各种行贿受贿、腐化堕落的政治丑闻，以及尔虞我诈、彼此拆台、国家机关运作迟滞的事情自然屡见不鲜。更重要的是，资本主义私有制所维护的资产阶级专政，其本质是少数富人对大多数穷人的专政。在资本主义国家，民主、自由对于富人来说确实是真实的，而对劳动人民来说则是虚伪的。民主作为一种政治制度，是在一定的经济基础上产生并为经济基础服务的。在资本主义私有制度下，资产阶级民主制度无论怎样发展，归根到底都是为着保障资产阶级的统治地位和统治秩序。被剥削被压迫的雇佣劳动者哪里有什么“按照自己意愿组织和发展的自由”，哪里有什么“选择权力”。被资本主义国家取缔或宣布为非法组织的党派团体何止少数，所谓选择权力也只是资本家的专利。顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，津津乐道资产阶级国家的选举制度，似乎那才是真正的民主和自由。其实，在垄断资产阶级拥有绝大部分生产资料和社会财富的条件下，所谓普选制，不过是保证垄断资产阶级可以挑选自己中意的政治代表来代替自己管理国家。每隔几年一次的竞选，都是地地道道的金钱的竞选，每一届掌权者又无不是为维护垄断寡头的统治效劳的。资产阶级民主自由制度终究是掩饰资产阶级专政的遮羞布。这个事实说明，只有在生产资料公有制的条件下，人民大众才有可能享有广泛而真实的民主、自由权利。
    在中国，以社会主义公有制取代私有制，是一场深刻的革命。生产资料公有制的建立和发展，剥削阶级和剥削制度的消灭，使全体人民成为新国家、新社会的主人，真正当家做主，享有依法管理国家经济、文化和社会事务的广泛权力。这同资产阶级民主以及一切以私有制为基础的剥削阶级的民主，有着本质的区别。因此，中国人民以社会主义公有制取代以私有制为基础的社会形态的过程，必然是不断加强和发展社会主义民主的过程。
    建国40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，社会主义民主政治制度逐步得到加强，人民代表大会制度、共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度不断完善。人民通过由自己选举产生的全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会行使管理国家的权力。社会各种基层民主制度和民主监督制度日趋健全。通过这一系列基本政治制度和民主制度，广大人民群众积极参与国家管理和政治生活。随着社会主义民主的发展和社会主义法制的健全，我国社会主义民主政治逐步走向制度化、法律化，人民享有的各种权利受到法律的切实保护。我国宪法载明的“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民”，正在社会各个领域实现。《宣言》的炮制者无视这一现实，只能说明他们站在反社会主义、反人民的立场上。
    应当承认，在我们的社会中，确实存在贪污腐败、官僚主义等消极现象。之所以存在这些消极现象，一是因为我们的社会是从半殖民地半封建社会脱胎而出，旧的痕迹还没有完全清除。二是我国现在处在社会主义初级阶段，社会主义生产关系在某些环节上不够完善，一些具体的管理制度、组织形式和工作方式还存在缺陷。贪污腐败、官僚主义等现象，正是我们要坚决加以纠正的，坚持社会主义公有制则是我们纠正这些弊端的重要保障。在私有制的国家里，官员的腐败现象更为普遍、更为严重。这个事实也证明，腐败与公有制没有必然的联系。
    中国的真正希望在哪里？
    《宣言》的炮制者在其宣言名称之前赫然冠之以“中国的希望”，借此蛊惑人心，以售其奸。然而，饱尝过半殖民地半封建社会被欺凌、被剥削之苦的中国人民深深懂得，私有制是万恶之源。当生产资料被剥削阶级占有的时候，中国社会只能长期处在经济凋敝、社会混乱、文化落后的境地，劳动人民只能当牛做马，任人摆布和宰割。如果我们不坚持社会主义公有制占主体，而是像《宣言》炮制者主张的那样退回去走资本主义道路，势必重新出现贫富两极分化。在用劳动人民的血汗去重新培植和养肥一个“中产阶级”的同时，大多数社会成员必将再度沦为外国资本和本国剥削阶级的双重奴隶。这是中国人民绝对不能答应的。私有制决不是中国的希望所在，这是中国历史作出的结论。
    中国的真正希望在于坚持社会主义公有制，在于通过深化改革使社会主义公有制更臻完善。只有这样，经济的繁荣和社会的进步才有保障，人民当家做主的地位才能巩固。应当承认，现阶段我国的社会主义公有制还不完善。但是，也必须看到，任何一种新型的所有制形式从初步确立到最终完善，都要经历一个历史过程。资本主义私有制搞了几百年，尽管生产资料私人占有的本质始终没有改变，但其具体的实现形式已几经变化和调整。社会主义公有制在我国建立还不到40年，指望它一下子就完美无缺，是不切实际的。还要看到，公有制与私有制的运行机制不同，私有制主要是依赖固有经济规律自发牵引社会生产，而公有制则是以科学预见性指导社会生产，受着多种因素的制约，要做到预见的科学、准确，难度很大，有些失误是难免的。党的十一届三中全会以前的一个较长时期，我们在所有制问题上的确存在过认识上的偏差和工作上的失误，主观地给社会主义公有制附加了许多并非其本质属性的原则。比如，片面强调所有制结构的“一大二公”、纯而又纯，使生产关系的变革超越了我国的生产力发展水平。又比如，把对经济实行高度集中的行政管理和国家直接经营管理企业当作社会主义公有制实现的唯一模式，排斥市场机制，否认企业的生产经营自主权。这些偏差和失误在一定程度上削弱了公有制经济的内在活力，使社会主义公有制的优越性未能得到充分发挥。
    认真总结历史经验，有助于我们深化对社会主义公有制的认识。理解社会主义公有制发展完善的长期性和艰巨性，将会增强我们坚持公有制的信念，避免改革中急于求成、来回折腾的偏差。十一届三中全会以后，党中央从我国处在社会主义初级阶段的基本国情出发，对现阶段社会主义的所有制结构和社会主义公有制的实现形式进行了许多重要改革和积极探索。一方面在公有制经济占主体地位的前提下，允许在生产社会化程度不高的部门和行业发展个体经济和私营经济，允许兴办中外合资企业和外商独资企业，作为社会主义公有制经济的必要补充；另一方面又致力于改革过分集中的经济管理体制，实现所有权与经营权的适度分离，使公有制经济适应社会主义有计划商品经济发展的要求。这些都促进了生产的大大发展。
    10年改革的实践证明，以公有制为主体、多种经济成分并存的所有制结构，适合我国的国情和生产力发展水平。改革的实践还证明，社会主义公有制有着十分丰富的内涵和多种实现形式，公有制与商品经济是完全相容的。只要我们采用科学的、合理的公有制实现形式，公有制企业完全可以更加富有效率，更加充满生机和活力。
    所有热切期盼祖国繁荣富强的炎黄子孙都知道，坚持和完善社会主义公有制是中国的真正希望。但是，《宣言》的炮制者却说“祖国的儿女”不愿在国内当主人，大家都愿意到海外去，有的甚至愿意做人家的“三等公民”。这是彻头彻尾的造谣。因为绝大多数目前在海外学习和工作的中华儿女都是热爱祖国，渴望献身于祖国的建设大业的。一切有志于振兴中华的爱国者，应当有用自己的双手把祖国建设得更加富强，使祖国永远岿然屹立于世界民族之林的宏伟抱负付诸实现。
    总之，我们进行的经济体制改革，是在坚持社会主义公有制的前提下对公有制的完善和发展，绝不是要否定或削弱社会主义公有制，绝不允许搞资本主义私有化。如果像《宣言》炮制者那样，视社会主义公有制为“祸源”，视资本主义私有制为终极目标，把那些社会化程度很高、维系国计民生、关系国家安危的国营经济肢解给私人占有，其结果必然摧毁社会化大生产的基础，造成国民经济的巨大混乱和社会的两极分化，最终导致生产力的极大破坏和社会动荡。牺牲广大劳动人民的根本利益，回头走资本主义道路，这正是《宣言》的炮制者和鼓吹者们叫嚷要“早日敲响公有制的丧钟”的要害所在。以谋求最广大人民的利益作为奋斗宗旨的中国共产党人，以劳动人民作为国家主人的社会主义社会，难道能允许这样的历史悲剧重演吗？决不允许。经过血与火洗礼的中国人民，将沿着自己选定的社会主义道路坚定不移地走下去。
