Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th.

The nationwide meeting of directors of bureaus of civil affairs, which concluded today in Beijing, proposed that further enhancing the role of social stability mechanisms is the current central task of civil affairs work.

In his speech at the meeting, Minister of Civil Affairs Cui Naifu pointed out that stability at the grassroots level should be promoted through strengthening the construction of self-governing organizations such as village committees and residents' committees. In rural areas, the focus should be on resolving the issue of some village-level organizations being paralyzed or semi-paralyzed; in cities, the cohesion of grassroots organizations should be enhanced to address social issues at the grassroots level.

He said that social stability should be promoted through effective disaster relief and assistance work. In regions frequently affected by disasters and poverty, disaster relief and assistance work should be prioritized in civil affairs work. Those who embezzle or misappropriate disaster relief funds should be dealt with seriously.

In discussing the work of preferential treatment and resettlement, Cui Naifu proposed that the overall situation should be considered, and the resettlement of demobilized soldiers should be done well. The relevant policies of the State Council should be firmly implemented, and ideological and political work should be done well for the objects of preferential treatment, demobilized soldiers, and retired and demobilized military cadres.

Regarding the current situation where social welfare enterprises, which primarily aim to place disabled people in jobs, face many new difficulties, Cui Naifu pointed out that the various support and protection policies for social welfare enterprises should maintain relative stability and continuity and should not be easily changed. Social welfare enterprises should be consolidated, and the policy of stable employment for the disabled should be maintained.

Cui Naifu pointed out that the management of social organizations should be strengthened, reversing the situation of the past few years where the development of associations was out of control, with multiple approvals and multiple management bodies. The work of associations should be brought under the track of legal registration and management.
