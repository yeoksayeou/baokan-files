The Jinan Military Region's First Communication Headquarters' 10th Battalion has a "couple" maintenance post. Two years ago, the wife, following her husband Qu Junchang, resolutely moved to a communication maintenance post that is located in a remote and harsh area. Over the past two years, the more than 20 kilometers of defense communication lines they maintain have never experienced any faults.
