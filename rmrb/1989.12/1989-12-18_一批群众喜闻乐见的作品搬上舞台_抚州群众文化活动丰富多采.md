A batch of works popular among the masses take to the stage
Fuzhou's mass cultural activities are rich and varied

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, NANCHANG — Reporter Zhaoxiangru reports: While focusing on the "crackdown on pornography and illegal publications," Jiangxi Province's Fuzhou Region has also paid attention to enriching mass culture. All 12 counties in the region have nurtured and supported a batch of works popular among the masses to take to the stage. A group of cultural elites rooted among the masses have shown their talents. The flourishing of the cultural market has also promoted the deepening of the "crackdown on pornography and illegal publications."

Fuzhou Region has specially organized 1,000 people to conduct multiple large-scale inspections of the region's book, magazine, and audio-visual markets. While cleaning up and rectifying the book, magazine, and audio-visual markets, the regional cultural department, together with other departments, has tailored measures to local conditions to vigorously promote social cultural work. Nanfeng County has a tradition of enjoying and practicing the Nuo (pronounced "luo") dance. Under the careful organization and guidance of the cultural department, the entire county has established 116 Nuo dance teams, which sing and dance healthily and vigorously, and have also participated in the national arts festival performances.

Fuzhou is the hometown of the great dramatist of the Ming Dynasty, Tang Xianzu. Currently, the entire region has 20 folk art performance troupes, 207 urban and rural amateur drama troupes, and more than 40 drama creators. They work hard during the day and perform during the slack farming season or at night.

In enriching cultural undertakings, Fuzhou Region has discovered and selected a batch of active members and established more than 1,600 village cultural rooms, more than 200 township cultural stations, and 13 district and county cultural palaces and cultural centers.

Leaders at all levels in Fuzhou Region have realized that without enriching cultural activities, the "crackdown on pornography and illegal publications" will be difficult to thoroughly implement. Therefore, they have paid attention to solving the housing needs for cultural activities; leaders at all levels have taken on the leadership of cultural stations, clarifying their roles; cultural rooms have been staffed with the right personnel; sufficient funds have been allocated to solve the financial issues; and cultural activity enthusiasts have been cultivated.

    一批群众喜闻乐见的作品搬上舞台
    抚州群众文化活动丰富多采
    本报南昌电　记者赵相如报道：江西省抚州地区在抓“扫黄”的同时，注意繁荣群众文化，全地区12个县均扶植和支持了一批群众喜闻乐见的作品搬上舞台，一批扎根于群众之中的文艺骨干大显身手。文化市场的繁荣又促进了“扫黄”向纵深发展。
    抚州地区曾专门抽调1000多人，对全地区书报、杂志和音像市场进行了多次大规模的检查，在清理整顿书报杂志及音像市场的同时，地区文化部门会同其它部门一起，因地制宜大抓繁荣社会文化工作。南丰县群众有跳傩（音罗）舞的爱好和习俗，在文化部门的精心组织和引导下，全县群众成立了116个傩舞队，边唱边跳、健康活泼，还参加了全国艺术节的表演。
    抚州是明朝大戏剧家汤显祖的家乡。如今全地区有民间文艺表演团体20个，城乡业余剧团207个，还有40多名戏剧创作人员。他们白天辛勤劳动，农闲或夜晚搞演出活动。
    抚州地区在繁荣文化事业中，发现和挑选出一批积极分子，并建立村文化室1600多个，乡镇文化站200多个，地、县群艺馆、文化馆13个。
    抚州地区各级领导认识到，如不抓“繁荣”，“扫黄”就很难彻底，因此他们注意解决文化活动所需的房子；由各级领导兼任文化站领导，摆正位子；给文化室配好班子；给足经费，解决票子问题；培养文艺活动积极分子。
