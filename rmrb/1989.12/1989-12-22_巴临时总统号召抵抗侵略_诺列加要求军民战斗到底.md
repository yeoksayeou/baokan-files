Panama's interim president, Rodriguez, called on the nation to rise up and resist the invading U.S. forces at a press conference held in a certain location in Panama City on the morning of December 20.

Panama's national radio station broadcast Rodriguez's speech live. Rodriguez said that the U.S. invasion was a barbaric act committed by the U.S. military stationed in the Panama Canal Zone against the Panamanian people.

According to reports from the U.S.-occupied Panama TV Channel 2, Panama's opposition leader, Guillermo Endara, swore in as president in the early hours of December 20 in the Congress building surrounded by U.S. forces.

The TV station also announced that the U.S. government had recognized the government led by Endara.

Our reporter in Mexico City, Guo Weicheng, reported: Panama's leader and head of the National Defense Forces, Noriega, called on the National Defense Forces and the people to continue fighting against the U.S. invasion. The U.S. has offered a $1 million bounty for Noriega's capture. Latin American countries have strongly condemned the U.S. invasion.

Mexican television stations broadcast a recorded speech by General Noriega from a secret location today. Noriega congratulated the National Defense Forces and the Panamanian people on their brave resistance. He said, "It's either victory or death; not a step back." He urged the Panamanian military and people to resist to the end and called on all countries to provide material assistance.

According to reports from Panama City, after the daytime of December 20, the organized resistance by the National Defense Forces and the militia "Dignity Battalion" in Panama City had collapsed. U.S. fighter jets and helicopters circled over Panama City all day. The Panamanian government has gone into a state of secrecy.

    新华社巴拿马城12月20日电　（记者胡泰然）巴拿马临时总统罗德里格斯20日上午在首都巴拿马城某地举行的记者招待会上，号召全国人民奋起抵抗美国侵略军。
    巴拿马国家电台实况广播了罗德里格斯的讲话。
    罗德里格斯说，美国的入侵是通过它驻扎在巴拿马运河区的军队“对巴拿马人民犯下的野蛮罪行”。
    另据美军占领的巴拿马电视2台报道，巴拿马反对派领导人吉列尔莫·恩达拉20日凌晨在美军包围着的议会大厦宣誓就任总统。
    这家电视台还宣布，美国政府已经承认了以恩达拉为首的政府。
    本报墨西哥城12月20日电  记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马政府首脑、国防军司令诺列加要求国防军与人民继续作战抵抗美国侵略。美国悬赏100万美元捉拿诺列加。拉美国家纷纷谴责美国的侵略行为。
    墨西哥各电视台播出了诺列加将军今天在一个秘密地方的讲话录音。诺列加祝贺国防军与巴拿马人民的英勇抵抗。他说，“不是胜利就是死亡；一步也不能后退”。他要求巴拿马军队与人民抵抗到底，并呼吁世界各国给予物质援助。
    据来自巴拿马城的消息，今天白天以后，巴拿马城内国防军及民兵“尊严营”有组织的抵抗已经瓦解。美军的战斗机、直升机整天在巴拿马城上空盘旋。巴拿马政府进入秘密状态。
