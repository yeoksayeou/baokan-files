What Do the Red Line and Red Hook Mean on Court Notices?

Editor,

We often see that in the notices issued by the people's courts for the legal execution of criminals, a red line is drawn under the names of those who are to be executed by shooting, and a red hook is drawn in the blank space at the end of the notice. What do these mean?

Program Haifang,

In the feudal society of our country, there was a procedure in the execution of the death penalty called "hook decision." This meant that after the Ministry of Punishments reviewed and upheld the original judgment of death, the emperor would make a decision to hook out the name of the condemned to execute the death penalty.

Now, the people's courts, after legally executing the death penalty on criminals who have been sentenced to death and whose executions are to be carried out immediately, will publish a notice of execution. Some of these notices have a "red bar" drawn under the name of the condemned, while others have a large "red hook" drawn at the "this notice" section. Some have both. This practice is not stipulated by law, but it is followed as a customary practice from the past. It means that the condemned, whose names have been hooked out, have been "verified as the correct person" by the judicial personnel and there is no mistake in the execution.

### 法院布告上的红线红勾是啥意思？

    法院布告上的红线红勾是啥意思？
    编辑同志：
    我们经常看到，在人民法院依法判处犯罪分子的布告上，被枪毙的犯罪分子名字下边划一条红线，在布告结尾空白处划一个红勾。这是什么意思？
    河南安阳县吕村乡　程海方程海方同志：
    我国封建社会在执行死刑的程序中，有一种程序谓“勾决”，即经刑部复审维持死刑的原审判决，呈送皇帝作出勾去死囚姓名方可执行死刑的裁决。
    现在，人民法院对判处死刑立即执行的罪犯，依法执行死刑后，在公布执行死刑的布告上，有的在死刑罪犯的姓名上划一“红杠”，有的则在“此布”处划一大“红勾”，有的二者兼有。此举法律并无规定，但都如此效行，沿用过去的习惯作法，意思是勾决出的死刑罪犯，已经审判人员“验明正身”并无错杀之误。
