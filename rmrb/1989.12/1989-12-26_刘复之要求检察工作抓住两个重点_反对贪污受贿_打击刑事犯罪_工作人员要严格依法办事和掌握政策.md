Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 25th.

Procuratorial Chief Liu Fuzhi yesterday, when meeting with representatives of the Guangdong Provincial Procuratorial Work Conference, pointed out that the two key points of combating corruption and bribery and severely cracking down on criminal activities must not be relaxed and must be continued. This is the direction for building a clean government and maintaining social stability and unity, and it must be adhered to. No matter who commits a crime, once caught, they must be strictly dealt with according to law. However, evidence is needed, and the facts must be verified. Do not rely on arresting people to solve problems. Do not use arrest as a substitute for investigation. Investigations and research must be conducted, and evidence must be relied upon. Do not arrest people lightly.

Liu Fuzhi said that to carry out the fight against economic and criminal activities in depth, it is necessary to consciously accept the leadership of the Party, the support of the government, and the supervision of the People's Congress. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has improved and strengthened its leadership, and the phenomenon of not being familiar with laws and legal work has become less and less. Many party committees have done a good job. For major issues and major cases in the procuratorial organs, if there is no grasp, they must be reported to the party committee, and they must actively and consciously seek the leadership and support of the party committee. Accepting the supervision of the People's Congress is also very important. Work reports must be actively submitted to the People's Congress and not just go through the motions. It is also necessary to respect the government and obtain its support. Only by actively seeking the leadership of the party committee, the supervision of the People's Congress, and the support of the government can the procuratorial organs do a good job and avoid major mistakes.

Liu Fuzhi said that last year, the procuratorial work nationwide achieved certain results, and the tasks for next year are heavy. He hopes that the broad procuratorial personnel will definitely strictly follow the law and policies, be modest and prudent, avoid arrogance and impetuosity, rectify their work style, and work diligently.

    刘复之要求检察工作抓住两个重点
    反对贪污受贿　打击刑事犯罪
    工作人员要严格依法办事和掌握政策
    新华社广州12月25日电（记者张才龙、通讯员李坤）最高人民检察院检察长刘复之昨天在接见广东省检察工作会议代表时指出，反贪污受贿和严厉打击刑事犯罪两个重点不能放松，一直要抓下去，这是廉政建设和维护社会安定团结的大方向。
    刘复之说，1989年全国检察工作做了两件事，一是反贪污贿赂斗争；二是严厉打击刑事犯罪活动。今后，这两个重点不能放松，一直要抓下去。这是廉政建设和维护社会安定团结的大方向，一定要坚持下去。不管谁犯罪，抓到就要严格依法办事。但是要靠证据，要搞准，不要靠捕人解决问题。不要以捕代侦。要搞调查研究，重证据，不要轻易抓人。
    刘复之说，要把打击经济犯罪和刑事犯罪活动深入地进行下去，必须自觉地接受党的领导、政府的支持和人大的监督。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党改善和加强了领导，不大熟悉法律和政法工作的现象越来越少了。很多党委的工作都做得很好。检察机关的一些重大的问题和重大的案件，没有把握的，一定要请示报告党委，要主动自觉地争取党委的领导和支持。接受人大监督也十分重要，要主动向人大汇报工作，不能搞走过场。还有就是一定要尊重政府，要取得政府的支持。检察机关只有积极主动地争取党委的领导，人大的监督和政府的支持，才能把工作做好，不会发生大的错误。
    刘复之说，去年全国检察工作取得一定的成绩，明年的工作任务很重。希望广大检察机关的工作人员，一定要严格依法办事和掌握政策，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，端正作风，兢兢业业地工作。
