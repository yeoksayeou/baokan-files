The city of Baise is once again bathed in the slanting rays of the winter sun. The Baise Uprising, led by Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and the outstanding son of the Guangxi Zhuang people, Wei Bagu, has been 60 years since it began.

On this meaningful day, we visited this heroic land. Reflecting on that glorious page of history, we asked many people in Baise the same question: What influence does history leave on the present? What echoes does the present give to history?

		Pragmatism

In Baise, from history to the present, two words are written: pragmatism.

On December 11, 1929, the communists Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and the outstanding son of the Guangxi Zhuang people, Wei Bagu, objectively analyzed the actual situation in Guangxi at the time. They boldly abandoned the central cities of Nanning and Liuzhou, determining that the location for the revolutionary uprising and the establishment of the Soviet government should be in the Baise mountain area, where the enemy's forces were weak, the party had a good mass base, and there was ample room for maneuver. This was undoubtedly a prominent manifestation of the combination of pragmatic spirit and revolutionary daring.

Half a century later, this pragmatic spirit shone brightly again on the land of Baise.

1984 was a year of turning points and pioneering significance for Baise. It was in this year that the stone and soil mountains, which accounted for more than 90% of the total area, were finally associated with words like "hope," "way out," "advantage," "potential," and "enrichment" in the eyes of the 3.4 million people of Baise.

Baise's mountainous region had been too closely and too long associated with "poverty." From the liberation until 1984, the annual per capita net income of farmers in the Baise region was only about 150 yuan. Among the 23 "national-level" poverty-stricken counties in Guangxi, 9 were in the Baise region.

In 1984, after a thorough, calm, objective review, investigation, discussion, and verification, the Baise Municipal Party Committee and the Administrative Committee concluded: the region's per capita 17 acres of mountainous land was the source of hope and the way out; for decades, focusing only on the less than one acre of arable land per capita, resulting in opposition to the mountains, resentment towards the mountains, and the destruction of the mountains for single-crop farming, was the fatal cause of poverty.

A 24-character development policy suitable for Baise was proposed, with the focus on the word "mountain": rely on the mountains to develop the mountains.

The following year, based on this policy, the Municipal Party Committee and the Administrative Committee proposed a development strategy that inspired people to strive: leverage Baise's mountainous terrain and subtropical climate to build, within 5 years or more, ten major commodity bases in the Baise mountainous region, with a focus on planting trees and fruits. By the time of completion, each person would have 1.5 to 2 acres. This would bring long-term significant social, economic, and ecological comprehensive benefits.

This strategic decision, rich in pragmatic spirit, had a strong resonance in reality. Soon, about 70% of the approximately 400,000 households in the entire region were involved in the development of the mountainous area. The people of Baise likened this to another "Baise Revolution" in the new era, a declaration of war on poverty.

The pragmatic spirit and scientific attitude made the Baise Municipal Party Committee and the Administrative Committee understand the importance of adapting to local conditions when implementing this concept: the right bank of the Youjiang River, with its unique climate, was widely planted with the fruit delicacies mango and sugarcane; the northwestern soil mountains were planted with star anise, tung oil, medlar, pine, fir, and tea; the southern stone mountains were planted with bamboo, which can be used for weaving and papermaking, in the cracks between the stones...

The pragmatic people of Baise, when building the ten major commodity bases, also did not forget to "use the short to support the long, use the short to promote the long": plant fruit trees between the trees, and plant grain under the fruit trees. The monotonous mountains were added with more colors. The new folk saying, "three years of grain, five years of tung, eight or nine years of star anise red," was another interpretation of the pragmatic spirit of the people of Baise.

When talking about the pragmatic vision of the people of Baise, one should not overlook the extremely important historical background: the people of Baise shifted all their enthusiasm and energy to the development of the mountainous area at the time when a few people were taking advantage of the business and company craze to enrich themselves!

The people of Baise were not intoxicated by this. The original Municipal Party Committee Secretary Huang Baoyao, who presided over the decision to develop the mountainous area, said: "Without the Party Central Committee's atmosphere of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, we would not have had such vision and courage."

		Struggle

From ideal to reality, the process is filled with sweat and hardship, unremitting struggle.

Hard work has never stopped in Baise: in the 1950s, they worked day and night to build reservoirs; in the 1960s, they saved money to build electric irrigation stations; in the 1970s, they opened winding mountain roads through thorny bushes.

In the 1980s, it was the people of Baise's turn to develop the mountainous area, to work hard and achieve results.

These are no longer news: in recent years, it is not until the fourth day of the Lunar New Year that the main leaders of the Municipal Party Committee and the Administrative Committee go to various types of mountain villages and hamlets.

The wife of the Municipal Party Committee Secretary Zeng Jiru has long been used to her husband's unusual behavior—Zeng Jiru, who was hospitalized for half a month due to a broken leg, hid the hospital's request for him to rest for 20 days the day after he was discharged and rushed to the vast sugarcane sea and orchards of the Youjiang River Valley.

The 30 households in Sanxiangtun, Baise City, which borders Yunnan, often boast to outsiders about this novel event: in the early summer and mid-autumn of this year, the then-Municipal Party Committee Secretary Huang Baoyao and the party and government leaders of various counties and cities successively crossed mountains and valleys to this remote small mountain village, which is famous for its prosperity from growing star anise. They became the highest-ranking overnight guests in the history of the mountain village. For this, they had to travel back and forth on the rugged mountain road for 8 hours!

Of course, hard work and enterprise are not limited to the main decision-makers. Since the implementation of the mountainous area development strategy, Baise has had more than 2,000 cadres working year-round in various mountainous area development contact points from the region to the counties and cities. As a responsible person from the Administrative Committee said, now the old revolutionary base area cadres of Baise have all found a stage to display their talents in their careers.

On the vast wilderness and hills, a new banner of struggle and enterprise in the new era is also being raised, inspiring the old revolutionary base area farmers to become a generation of mountain area builders who declare war on poverty, ignorance, and laziness.

Who would have thought of this before? Liu Shaolou, a poor farmer in Dashizhou Gorge, Leye County, dared to lead his family to set up camp on the mountain, cross villages and hamlets to contract barren mountains for afforestation, and has planted more than 1,000 acres of trees so far. Under the trees, he plants drought-resistant grains. The forest is lush, and the grains are plentiful. His family not only became the first to achieve a household income of 10,000 yuan but also sold 25,000 kilograms of grain to the state in the past three years! Naturally, he became a famous mountain area news figure and was elected as a national labor model.

How can outsiders believe this? The 96 households in Nantian Village, Pingguo County, which is full of stones, planted more than 40,000 bamboo shoots in the cracks between the 26 bare mountain tops. The bamboo greens, provides firewood, provides money, and retains water. Last year, the entire village earned more than 100 yuan per capita from bamboo weaving and processing alone.

A mountainous area development strategy that follows the will of the people and is practical has thus mobilized and inspired the thousands of households in the mountainous area. Statistics show that 800,000 laborers in the Baise region have invested in the construction of the ten major commodity bases, accounting for 60% of the total labor force in the region!

For the old revolutionary base area of Baise, which has a poor foundation and a thin base, it is far from the time to shout for wealth and victory. But the new records created by the new era's mountainous area builders can show their results and value of joint struggle:

		—The entire region has planted various fruit trees and star anise, tea, tung oil, fir, and pseudobulbus, totaling 3.5 million acres, with an average of more than one acre per agricultural population; there are also 240,000 acres of sugarcane and 850,000 cattle;
		—In the past four years, 160,000 households and 930,000 people in the entire region have escaped poverty; 1,233 households have achieved an annual income of 10,000 yuan; another 10,000 households have laid the foundation for becoming 10,000 yuan households;
		—The scale management that breaks through the boundaries of townships, villages, and hamlets is rapidly breaking free from the constraints of small-scale farming. There are already 61 large mango orchards of more than 100 acres in the entire region.

The struggling people of Baise are not only transforming nature but also transforming themselves!

		Selflessness

Taking is not appropriate in Baise. Here, another worldview is welcomed and forged.

Female judge Ma Canfang has this worldview. This overseas Chinese from Thailand, 30 years ago, with her long braid, left Wuhan, where she was studying, and came to a grassroots court in a border town in the Baise mountainous area from the Central South Institute of Political Science and Law.

30 years later, the foreign student has been completely "localized." The Baise mountainous area has gained a national labor model and an advanced worker in the court system.

Among the many people from outside Baise who have dedicated their youth and life to the construction of the old revolutionary base area, Ma Canfang is just an ordinary one.

Yu Ying, the director of the Baise Regional Science and Technology Commission, is from Shenyang. He is sturdy and has a full head of silver hair, a real "Northeast Tiger." But after graduating from Peking University's Biology Department, he spent 25 precious years in the most remote county of the Baise region, Longlin Various Nationalities Autonomous County.

Even today, Yu Ying has no regrets. In Baise, he found a support point for his career development: the mango preservation technology he presided over for the development of the Youjiang River Valley mangoes passed the autonomous region-level appraisal and is in the leading position in the country.

Take a look at Tianqiao. This ordinary village, located in the deep mountains at the junction of Guizhou and Guangxi, is not on ordinary maps. It is famous for the construction of a large hydropower station here, which ranks in the top of the country in terms of power generation.

But how many people know the price that the people of Baise paid for it? To build this large hydropower station, which is related to the interests of three provinces, the Baise region donated 6 townships and 101 natural villages, 27,000 acres of arable land. For this, 5 township governments and 3,113 households of farmers moved to other places without complaint.

The people of Baise say, we have difficulties, and the country also has difficulties. Local needs should first serve the national needs. Our ancestors shed blood and died for the revolution without complaint, so what is a small sacrifice for us?

It is with this spirit that another national key construction project in Baise—the development of the Pingguo Aluminum Base—also had a "green light" throughout the construction.

The construction project used 6,000 acres of land, and the land was acquired in 70 days; the power station used 130 acres of land, and the relevant procedures were completed in 7 days; the railway line to the mine used 1,000 acres of land; it only took one month to acquire the land... Moreover, the average land acquisition fee per acre was still less than 2,000 yuan!

Each of these key projects contains the affection and support of the people of Baise! "First the country, then the family" has become the criterion for the people of Baise to handle the relationship between national and local interests.

Take a look at Dongyantun. This small mountain village with only 67 households and 354 people has long been plagued by poverty. After solving the problem of food and clothing, the people first thought of the country, and the first thing they did was to fulfill the obligations they could not afford in the past.

Without the need for cadres to mobilize, without seeking material rewards, the people of Dongyantun infused deep love for the country into their silent actions. This year, the entire village sold 243,800 kilograms of grain to the state, with an average of 688.7 kilograms per person, of which 38 households contributed more than 5,000 kilograms of grain to the state.

In contrast to the still backward economy, the Baise region has basically completed the state's grain storage tasks ahead of schedule and in excess of the quota in recent years!

Not afraid of losing out, willing to lose out—that is the respectable and lovable old revolutionary base area of Baise!

What about the leadership organs and cadres here—the Municipal Party Committee and the Administrative Committee?

The Baise Municipal Party Committee and the Administrative Committee do not have a good car that can climb steep slopes, let alone a high-level imported sedan; there is no decent guesthouse, let alone a "modern" reception room... Such a large Municipal Party Committee and Administrative Committee spend only more than 10,000 yuan a year on reception fees.

There are too many things they do not have. But they have the Communist Party members' integrity and public service, the revolutionary tradition of hard work, and the lofty spiritual realm of serving the people wholeheartedly... Therefore, the party committees and governments of the Baise region and counties have not had any leading cadres in "official trading" companies; for more than six years, the case files of the regional intermediate court have not had any records of economic crimes by cadres at the deputy section chief level and above...

The leaders of the Baise region and counties rarely talk to reporters about the above-mentioned have and have not. What they are deeply concerned about is the various have nots and have in the people. All this makes one think of the Song Dynasty politician Fan Zhongyan and Fan Zhongyan's famous saying, which he practiced all his life: "Worry about the world before others do, and be happy after others do."

    百色精神
    ——写在百色起义60周年之际
    本报记者　郑盛丰　蒋耀强
    百色山城，又一次沐浴在冬日的斜阳里。邓小平、张云逸等领导的百色起义，已经整整60度春秋。
    在这深有意义的时日，我们踏访这片英雄的土地。联想那光荣的一页，我们向许多百色人提出了一个相同的问题：历史留给现实什么影响？现实报以历史哪些回声？
          求　实
    在百色，从历史到现实，都书写着两个字：求实。
    1929年12月11日，共产党人邓小平、张云逸，与广西壮族人民的优秀儿子韦拔群等，客观地分析广西当时的实际情况后，果敢地放弃中心城市南宁和柳州，把举行革命起义、建立苏维埃政权的地点，确定在敌对力量薄弱，我们党群众基础较好，回旋余地很大的百色山区。这无疑是求实精神与革命胆略相结合的突出表现。
    时间跨越半个多世纪，这种求实精神，又熠熠生辉于百色大地。
    1984年，是百色有着转折和开拓意义的年头。正是这一年，占总面积90％以上的石山土山，在340万百色人的眼中，才与“希望”、“出路”、“优势”、“潜力”、“致富”等词汇连在一起。
    百色山区与“贫困”连结得太紧和太久了。从解放直到1984年，百色地区农民人均年纯收入仍不过150元左右，在广西23个“国家级”扶贫县中，百色地区就占有9个。
    1984年，百色地委、行署经过深入冷静的客观回顾、调查、研讨、论证，认定：全地区人均17亩的山地，正是希望与出路所在；而多少年来眼睛只盯着人均不到一亩的耕地，以至与山作对，怨山、毁山搞单一经营，才是造成贫困的致命症结。
    适合百色地方特点的24字发展方针提出来了，重点落在一个“山”字：靠山养山。
    次年，根据这个方针，地委、行署提出一个催人奋发的发展战略：发挥百色山多又具有亚热带气候的优势，用5年或更长的时间，建设以植树种果为主体的百色山区十大商品基地；建成之日，人均占有1.5至2亩。由此将带来长期显著的社会、经济、生态综合效益。
    这个富于求实精神的战略性决策，在现实中引起了强烈反响。很快，全地区便有70％约40万农户投身山区开发。百色人把此喻为新时期向贫穷宣战的又一次“百色革命”。
    求实精神和科学态度，使百色地委和行署在实施这个构想时，懂得了因地制宜：气候条件得天独厚的右江河谷，广种果中珍品芒果和糖蔗；西北部土山，遍植八角、油桐、刺梨和松、杉、茶；南部石山，在石头缝中插栽可用于编织和造纸的山竹……
    注重实际的百色人，在建设十大商品基地时，也忘不了“以短养长、以短促长”：林间种果，果下种粮。单调的山头，添了不少色彩。“三年粮，五年桐，八年九年八角红”的新民谚，便是百色人求实精神的另一种注解。
    说到百色人的求实眼光，不应忽视极为重要的时代背景：百色人把全部热情和精力转移到山区开发之日，正是少部分人借经商热和公司热肥私利己之时！
    百色人并不因此陶醉。主持作出山区开发决策的原地委书记黄保尧说：“没有党中央解放思想实事求是的大气候，我们也不可能有这样的目光和胆略。”
          奋　斗
    从理想到现实，中间是浸透汗水充满艰辛的不懈奋斗。
    艰苦奋斗，在百色从来没有间断过：50年代，披星戴月修水库；60年代，节衣缩食建电灌站；70年代，荆棘丛中，开出一条条弯弯曲曲的盘山公路。
    80年代，又是百色人开发山区艰苦奋斗建功立业时。
    这些已不再是新闻：近几年，都是不出大年初四，地委和行署主要负责人，就分赴各种不同类型的山乡村寨。
    地委书记曾基瑞的爱人，早已习惯了丈夫这种有违常情的举动——曾基瑞因腿骨板扭伤住院治疗半月，出院第二天，他就藏起医院要他全休20天的证明书，直奔右江河谷，扎进那茫茫蔗海和大片果园中。
    与云南交界的百色市三相屯的30户农家，常在外人面前炫耀着这桩新鲜事：今年初夏和仲秋，年届六旬的原地委书记黄保尧和各县市党政领导，先后翻山越岭来到这个靠种八角致富闻名的偏僻小山村，成为山村有史以来职位最高的夜宿人。为此，他们得在无法通车的崎岖山道上来回跋涉8小时！
    当然，艰苦深入，志在创业，并不限于主要决策者们。自山区开发战略实施以来，百色从地区到各县市，共有二千多名干部长年奋斗在各自的开发山区联系点上。用行署一位负责人的话说，如今百色老区的干部，个个都找到了在事业上显示身手的大舞台。
    在广阔的荒野和坡岭上，也高扬起前所未有的新时期奋斗与创业旗帜，被激励而昂奋起来的老区农民，正成为向贫穷、愚昧和惰性宣战的一代山区建设者。
    过去何曾有过这种事？乐业县大石山沟中的贫困农民刘绍禄，竟敢率家人上山安营扎寨，跨乡过屯承包荒山植树造林，至今造林超千亩，林下间种旱谷，林茂粮丰，他家不但率先成为万元户，近三年还卖给国家粮食2.5万公斤！理所当然，他成了著名的山区新闻人物，当选为全国劳动模范。
    怎为外人所相信？满山石头的平果县内任屯，96户人家硬是在光秃秃的26座山头的石缝里种下4万余丛竹子。竹子献绿，献柴，献钱，蓄水。去年，光竹子编织加工一项，全屯就人均增收100多元。
    一个顺应民心切合实际的山区开发战略，就这样动员和激励起山区的千家万户。统计数字表明，百色地区投入10大商品基地建设的有80万劳力，占全地区总劳力的60％！
    对于基础太差、底子太薄的百色老区来说，现在远不是欢呼富裕与胜利的时候。但新时期山区创业者们所创造的一串新纪录，是可以显示出他们协力奋斗的成果和价值的：
    ——全地区已种有各种果树和八角、茶叶、油桐、杉木、田七等共350万亩，按农业人口平均人均超过一亩；另有甘蔗24万亩，养牛85万头；
    ——4年来，全地区已有16万户93万人脱贫；有1233户实现年收入达万元；另有1万多农户打下了万元户基础；
    ——打破乡、村、屯界的规模经营，正迅速突破小农经济束缚。仅连片100亩以上的芒果园，全地区就有61个。
    奋斗着的百色人，既在改造着自然，也在改造着自身！
            奉　献
    索取，在百色不合时宜。这里欢迎和锻铸另一种人生观。
    女法官马灿芳，就具有这种人生观。这位泰国归侨，30年前甩着长长的辫子，离开求学的武汉，从中南政法学院来到百色山区边境镇上的一个基层法庭工作。
    30年后，洋大学生完全“土化”了。百色山区多了个全国法院系统劳模、国家先进工作者。
    在众多为百色老区建设献青春、献终身的外地人中，马灿芳只是普通的一个。
    百色地区科委主任于英，老家沈阳。他身板结实，满头银丝，活脱脱一个“东北虎”。但他从北京大学生物系毕业后，却在百色地区最边远的隆林各族自治县，消耗了他25个宝贵年华。
    直至今日，于英也没有丝毫后悔。他在百色，找到了拓展事业的支撑点：他为发展右江河谷芒果主持研究的芒果保鲜技术，通过了自治区级鉴定，在国内居于领先地位。
    看一下天生桥吧。这个在普通地图上找不到，位于黔桂交界处的深山村寨，因发电量排在全国前列的大型电站在这里建设而声名远播。
    但有多少人知道百色人为它付出的代价？为了尽快兴建这个关系到三省区的大电站，百色地区献出了6个乡镇101个自然村屯，2.7万亩耕地，为此，5个乡镇政府，3113户农民毫无怨言地迁移他乡。
    百色人说，我们有困难，国家也有困难，地方需要应该首先服从国家需要。父辈们为革命抛头颅、洒热血死而无怨，我们做出点小牺牲算得了什么？
    正是得助于这种精神，同在百色的另一个国家重点建设工程——平果铝业基地的开发，建设中也一路“绿灯”。
    建设工程用地6000余亩，70天征地完毕；工程输电站用地130亩，7天办完有关手续，通往矿区的铁路线用地1000亩；只花一个月时间征地……而且，每亩征地费用平均还不到2000元！
    这一个个重点工程中，包含着百色人民的多少情意，多少支持！“先顾国家，后顾自家”，成了百色人民处理国家与地方利益关系的准则。
    不妨看看东演屯。这个只有67户354人的小山村，长期被贫困所困扰。解决温饱问题后，群众首先想到的是国家，第一件事是履行以往无力承担的义务。
    无需干部动员，不求物质奖励，东演屯群众以默默的行动注入了对国家深沉的爱。今年，全屯向国家交售粮食24.38万公斤，人均688.7公斤，其中有38户农民向国家贡献粮食超5000公斤。
    与尚属落后的经济成反比，百色地区近几年基本上年年都提前超额完成了国家下达的粮食入库任务！
    不怕吃亏，乐于吃亏——这就是可敬可爱的老区百色人！
    这里的领导机关和干部——地委和行署的情况又怎么样呢？
    百色地委和行署，没有一辆能爬陡坡的好汽车，更没有高级进口小卧车；没有一家像样的招待所，更没有一间“现代”的接待室……偌大的地委、行署，招待费一年只开支万余元。
    没有的东西太多了。但他们有共产党员的廉洁奉公，有艰苦奋斗的革命传统，有全心全意为人民服务的崇高思想境界……所以百色地区地、县两级党委、政府，没有领导干部在
  “官倒”公司里兼职、挂职；六年多来，地区中级法院的案卷里，尚未有过副处级以上干部经济犯罪的记录……
    百色地区的地县领导人，很少对记者谈论上述的有与无。他们所深切关注的，是人民群众中的种种无与有。这一切，不由得使人想起了宋朝政治家范仲淹，想起范仲淹终生实践的名言：先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐！
