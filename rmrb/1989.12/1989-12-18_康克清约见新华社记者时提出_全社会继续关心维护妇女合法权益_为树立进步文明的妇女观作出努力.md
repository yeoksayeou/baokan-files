Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Honorary Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, recently met with reporters from the Xinhua News Agency and proposed that the entire society continue to care for and protect women's legal rights, enforce relevant laws and regulations, and strive to eliminate discrimination against women and establish a progressive and civilized view of women.

December 18 is the 10th anniversary of the United Nations' adoption of the "Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women." In July 1980, Kang Keqing, as the head of the Chinese delegation, signed the convention on behalf of the Chinese government at the United Nations Midterm Review Conference on the Decade for Women held in Copenhagen. In September of the same year, the 16th session of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress formally approved the convention. Currently, 98 countries have approved and joined the convention.

Kang Keqing pointed out that the adoption of the convention is a major achievement of the United Nations Decade for Women and an important progress made by women around the world in their struggle for liberation and gender equality. The Chinese government believes that the basic principles of the convention are consistent with the wishes and demands of the Chinese people and women, and have practical significance for further achieving gender equality in China.

In her residence, Kang Keqing told reporters that the Chinese Communist Party and the government have always attached great importance to and protected the legal rights of women and children. Since the convention came into effect 10 years ago, the Chinese government has successively amended and promulgated a series of laws and regulations aimed at ensuring that women are not discriminated against by society and traditional forces and enjoy equal rights with men. For example, in 1980, the Third Session of the Fifth National People's Congress adopted a new Marriage Law, emphasizing marriage freedom and gender equality, and specifically pointing out the principles of freedom to marry and freedom to divorce; in 1982, the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress adopted a new Constitution, which made full provisions for the rights of women, marriage, family, mothers, and children, and specifically emphasized the protection of women's rights and interests, the implementation of equal pay for equal work, and the training and selection of female cadres; in 1985, the Third Session of the Sixth National People's Congress promulgated the Inheritance Law, which clearly stated that inheritance rights are equal for men and women, and women have the right to own, manage, and sell property; in 1988, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Protection of Female Workers, which stated that units suitable for women should not refuse to hire female workers, and male and female workers should enjoy equal treatment; recently, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has included the drafting of the Women's Protection Law in the five-year legislative plan and entrusted the All-China Women's Federation with the drafting work. She said that the enactment and implementation of these laws have ensured that women enjoy equal rights with men in politics, employment, education, health, economy, and social life, and have promoted the overall improvement of women's status.

Kang Keqing said that the 10 years since the adoption of the convention have been a period of reform and opening up and steady economic development in China. Women have actively participated in the reform, creating wealth for society while struggling for their own liberation and obtaining the rights and status they deserve, demonstrating their strength.

Kang Keqing also pointed out that due to the fact that China is currently in the primary stage of socialism, constrained by economic, cultural, and other conditions, there is still a significant gap between legal gender equality and actual equality. Women still face some problems, such as the persistence of feudal ideas of male superiority and the existence of phenomena that belittle or discriminate against women. The proportion of female illiterates is still high. In particular, the resurgence of the "six evils" such as prostitution and solicitation in recent years has seriously harmed women's physical and mental health. Therefore, the ongoing campaign to eliminate the "six evils" is necessary and deeply welcomed by the people, and it must be carried through to the end. At the same time, since women bear the dual responsibilities of social production and human reproduction, they must make extra efforts to overcome the new challenges encountered in their progress.

Kang Keqing said that the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made a decision to further rectify and deepen the reform, and achieving this goal requires a stable and harmonious social environment. The entire Party, the people of the whole country, including half of the population who are women, should unite as one, correctly understand the current economic situation, and strengthen their confidence in overcoming difficulties. Only with social stability and economic development can women's status and conditions be further improved and guaranteed, and women's rights can be more effectively protected. She hopes that women across the country will continue to consolidate and develop the political situation of stability and unity, and make new contributions to socialist modernization and reform and opening up. At the same time, she hopes that the whole society will continue to care for and protect women's legal rights, enforce relevant laws and regulations, and strive together to eliminate discrimination against women from the root.

    康克清约见新华社记者时提出
    全社会继续关心维护妇女合法权益
    为树立进步文明的妇女观作出努力
    新华社北京12月17日电  全国政协副主席、全国妇联名誉主席康克清日前约见本社记者时提出，希望全社会继续关心和维护妇女的合法权益，执行有关的法律和法规，为消除对妇女的歧视，树立进步、文明的妇女观而努力。
    今年12月18日是联合国通过《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》10周年。康克清于1980年7月在哥本哈根召开的联合国妇女10年中期审评大会上，作为中国代表团团长，代表我国政府签署了这个《公约》。同年9月，五届全国人大常委会第16次会议正式批准了《公约》。目前，世界已有98个国家批准和加入《公约》。
    康克清指出，《公约》的通过，是联合国妇女10年的重大成果，也是各国妇女为争取自身的解放，为实现男女平等而取得的重要进展。我国政府认为，《公约》的基本原则是与我国人民和广大妇女的愿望和要求相一致的，对我国进一步实现男女平等有着现实意义。
    康克清在她的寓所里对记者说，我国党和政府历来十分重视和维护妇女、儿童的合法权益。自《公约》生效10年来，我国政府相继修改和颁布了一系列旨在保证妇女不受社会歧视和传统势力阻碍，同男子一样享有平等权利的法律和法规。如，1980年五届全国人大三次会议通过新的《婚姻法》，强调婚姻自由，男女平等，特别指出了结婚自由、离婚自由两项原则；1982年五届全国人大五次会议通过的新《宪法》，对妇女、婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童的权益作了充分的规定，特别强调了保护妇女的权利和利益，实行男女同工同酬，培养和选拔妇女干部；1985年六届全国人大三次会议颁布的《继承法》，明确阐明继承权男女平等，妇女享有拥有财产、管理财产和出售财产的权利；1988年国务院颁布了《女职工劳动保护规定》，阐明凡适合妇女从事的单位不得拒绝招收女职工，男女职工享有同等的待遇；最近，全国人大常委会又把《妇女保护法》的制定列入了5年立法规划，并委托全国妇联负责起草工作。她说，这些法律的制定与实施保证了妇女在政治、就业、教育、保健、经济和社会生活等各个领域与男子享有平等的权利，推动了妇女地位的全面提高。
    康克清说，《公约》通过的10年，正是我国实行改革开放、经济稳步发展的10年。广大妇女积极投身改革，在为社会创造财富的同时，也在争取自身进一步解放，获得应有权利和地位的奋斗中，显示出了力量。
    康克清同时指出，由于我国目前尚处于社会主义初级阶段，受经济、文化等条件的制约，法律上的男女平等与事实上的平等还有很大差距，妇女仍面临着一些问题，如男尊女卑的封建意识还没有完全消除，轻视甚至歧视妇女的现象仍然存在，女文盲还占很大的比例等。特别是近年来卖淫嫖娼等“六害”丑恶现象的死灰复燃，严重危害了妇女的身心健康。因此，正在开展的扫“六害”斗争非常必要，深得人心，一定要一抓到底。同时，由于妇女承担着社会生产和人类自身再生产的双重任务，不付出加倍的努力，就很难克服前进中遇到的新的挑战。
    康克清说，最近党的十三届五中全会作出了进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定，实现这一目标需要有一个稳定、和谐的社会环境。全党全国人民，包括占人口半数的妇女，应同心同德，正确认识当前的经济形势，增强克服困难的信心。只有社会的安定，经济的发展，妇女的地位和状况才能得到进一步的提高和改善，妇女的权益才能得到更实际的保障。她希望全国妇女继续为巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，为社会主义现代化建设和改革开放作出新贡献。同时希望全社会继续关心和维护妇女的合法权益，执行有关的法律和法规。为从根本上消除对妇女的歧视而共同奋斗。
