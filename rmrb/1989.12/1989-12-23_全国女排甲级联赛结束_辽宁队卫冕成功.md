The 1989 National Women's Volleyball League A Division, which lasted 12 days, concluded today after 100 intense matches. The Liaoning team emerged as the champion with a perfect record of 10 wins. The Shaanxi and Shenyang Institute of Physical Education teams were relegated, while the top two teams from the B Division, Nankai University and Shanxi, will compete in the A Division C Group next year.

The teams that secured the second to sixth places are, in order: PLA, Shanghai, Hebei, Sichuan, and Zhejiang.

From this competition, it is evident that the top four teams—Liaoning, PLA, Shanghai, and Hebei—have maintained their strong positions, with Liaoning standing out as the strongest. Notably, Sichuan and Zhejiang teams showed significant improvement, securing the fifth and sixth places, respectively. In contrast, last year's top eight teams, including Hubei, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian, failed to make it into the top eight this year, with Tianjin even dropping to the 16th place.

    全国女排甲级联赛结束
    辽宁队卫冕成功
    本报广东江门12月22日电  历时12天的1989年全国女排甲级联赛经过百场激烈争夺，今天决出全部名次。辽宁队以10战全胜的佳绩卫冕联赛冠军。陕西、沈阳体院队遭降级厄运，今年乙级赛前两名南开大学和山西队则升入甲级C组比赛。
    获得二至六名的队依次是：八一、上海、河北、四川和浙江队。
    从这次比赛看，辽宁、八一、上海和河北队四强的地位仍然未被动摇，尤其是辽宁队，其实力更是胜人一筹。引人注目的是，四川队和浙江队在本次比赛中异军突起，跻身第5、6名，而去年八强的湖北、广东、天津和福建却被摒出前八名，更有甚者天津队降至第16名。
