Both military and civilian units should publicize advanced experiences and model deeds of supporting the military and caring for veterans and their families, learning from and promoting each other, and fostering a good atmosphere of honoring support for the military and loving the people, further strengthening military-civilian unity.

3. **Learn from Lei Feng and Promote New Customs**: Actively do good deeds for veterans and the people. During the holiday season, local governments should mobilize grassroots organizations to serve local troops and veterans, organizing various forms of service activities. Military units should also organize various convenience services, assisting local areas in holiday services, and striving to help the people solve problems.

4. **Inspect the Implementation of Preferential Policies and Discipline**: Local governments should organize teams to visit and comfort veterans and their families, checking the implementation and fulfillment of preferential treatment, subsidies, and allowances, and promptly solving any problems.

    本报北京12月4日讯  民政部、总政治部今天联合发出通知，要求全国全军在1990年新年春节期间，认真做好拥军优属、拥政爱民工作。
    通知要求各地军民要扎扎实实抓好以下几项工作：
    一、认真学习党的十三届四中全会、五中全会精神，以实际行动支持国家治理整顿和深化改革，促进安定团结。各级政府和部队政治机关要通过组织学习，使干部群众和指战员正确认识当前的经济形势，坚定克服困难的信心。要对广大优抚对象和部队指战员进行爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的思想教育以及革命传统教育，树立顾全大局、为国分忧的思想。各部队要主动与地方政府联系，统筹安排，拟定部队全年义务参加国家经济建设的规划。
    二、深入进行爱国拥军教育，广泛开展军民之间相互学习的活动。各地要采取多种形式进行生动形象的国防教育，大力宣传人民解放军在保卫祖国和建设祖国中的英雄业绩，在全社会形成支持爱护军队的良好风气。军队各级政治机关要组织部队认真搞好人民军队性质、宗旨和优良传统教育，增强尊重政府、热爱人民的自觉性。军队和地方都要大力宣扬拥军优属、拥政爱民的先进经验和模范事迹，互相学习，互相促进，树立和发扬拥军光荣、爱民高尚的好风气，进一步加强军民之间的团结。
    三、学雷锋、树新风，积极为优抚对象和人民群众做好事。节日期间，各地政府要广泛发动基层群众性拥军优属服务组织，为当地驻军和优抚对象开展各种形式的服务活动。各部队也要组织各种便民服务，协助驻地做好春节服务工作，努力为群众排忧解难。
    四、认真检查执行优抚政策和遵守群众纪律的情况。地方要组织力量深入基层，走访慰问烈、军属，对优待、抚恤和定补的落实和兑现情况进行一次检查，发现问题，及时解决。要对部队认真进行一次政策纪律教育，使军队在全国人民面前保持和发扬威武之师、文明之师的良好形象。
    五、有计划有组织地安排好军民联欢和慰问活动。要组织好对戒严部队的慰问活动。有关省、市、自治区可组织精干的慰问团到边防、海防前线进行慰问，积极为部队解决实际困难。军地双方都要组织好对革命伤残军人、伤病员和军队离退休老干部的慰问活动。各项活动都要注重实效，厉行节约，不得铺张浪费。
