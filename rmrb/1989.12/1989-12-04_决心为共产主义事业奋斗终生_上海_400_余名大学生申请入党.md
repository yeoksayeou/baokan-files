This semester, since the start of the school term, over 400 university students in Shanghai's colleges and universities have submitted applications to join the Party, vowing to dedicate their lives to the cause of communism.

Among these students applying to join the Party, 79 are from Fudan University, 46 from Jiaotong University, 31 from Tongji University, and 38 from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Some of these students, through their involvement in social practices, have come to understand China's bright future. Others, through reflecting on the turmoil and unrest, have further recognized the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Communist Party of China. They say, "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and there would be none of the progress we see today."

Many students have shared their journey of understanding the Party in their applications. They acknowledge that there are indeed instances of corruption within the Party, but these are isolated cases. The vast majority of Party members are good, and the Party's cadres are honest and upright. They truly represent the Party's overall interests and are dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly. One student wrote: "Our Party is not only great in history but remains great today. This is because the Party bears the great historical mission of revitalizing the nation and the people. In China, no other force can replace the Communist Party of China in leading and fulfilling this historical mission."

    决心为共产主义事业奋斗终生
    上海400余名大学生申请入党
    本报上海电　本学期开学以来，上海高等学校中已有400余名大学生向党组织递交了入党申请报告，决心为共产主义事业奋斗终生。
    这些申请入党的大学生中，复旦大学79名，交通大学46名，同济大学31名，上海财经大学38名。他们中有的在社会实践中认清了中国发展的光辉前景，有的通过对学潮和动乱的反思，进一步认识了中国共产党的光荣、伟大、正确。他们说，没有共产党就没有新中国，就没有今天一切。
    许多学生在入党申请报告中谈了自己对党的认识过程。他们说，党内确实存在腐败现象，然而这毕竟是极少数，绝大多数党员是好的，党的干部是清正廉洁的。他们真正代表了党的整体利益，是全心全意为人民服务的。一个学生写道：“我们党不仅在历史上是伟大的，现在仍然是伟大的。因为这个党肩负着振兴国家和民族的伟大历史重任。在中国，没有第二支力量能够代替中国共产党在完成这项历史使命中的领导地位和作用。”
