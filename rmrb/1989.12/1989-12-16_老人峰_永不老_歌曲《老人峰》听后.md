A young military singer stands on a brightly lit stage, solemnly singing about "Old Man Peak." This is a new song brought to the Beijing stage by the Guangzhou-based War Troops Song and Dance Troupe for the autumn season.

	Obviously, this is not a song of rolling yellow earth from the northwest, nor is it a typical scenic song, nor is it a song influenced by Western "blues" music that softly sings about nature. It is a work that the song's creators call a "major theme." Listening to it, savoring it, one feels a sense of solemnity like a mountain peak.

	Old Man Peak is a mountain with an indomitable spirit. Its shoulders are covered with frost, snow, and rain, and its heart is burdened with the weight of time. Its white hair of ice and snow, and wrinkles of ravines, have experienced everything, understood everything, and seen through everything, yet it "stands silently in the clouds." It is said that in the initial draft, the author wrote that Old Man Peak "stands silently hidden in the clouds." Later, the word "hidden" was changed to "stands." This single word gives Old Man Peak a spirit.

	Lyricist Qú Qú did not seek out novel metaphors here, nor did he use language that is difficult to understand. He simply poured out his emotions and feelings. Unique ideas, apt symbolism, and concise expression all work together to highlight the charm and power of Old Man Peak. He said: "From a historical perspective, the people, or a nation, despite suffering many disasters, will never be destroyed." Isn't Old Man Peak the symbol of the Chinese nation? Bearing the weight of five thousand years of history, facing a vast world, it can calmly and rationally grasp the present and the future. This is precisely the symbol of our hopeful ancient nation.

	The mountain is the people, and the people are the mountain. Maxim Gorky once said: "Man should be capitalized." The lyricist and composer Xiǎo Xīng turned the abstract capital letter into a towering mountain, using it to sing the praises of the people's greatness and dignity, the people's will and strength.

	Composer Tú Guāng has a keen sense of perception and expression. He uses the ancient and rustic tunes of northwestern folk songs as his material, infusing the melody with the colors of the times, his own thoughts, and feelings. It is deeply emotional yet not lacking in strength, beautiful yet not lacking in grandeur, vividly conveying the meaning of the lyrics, and adding to the vitality of the everlasting Old Man Peak.

    老人峰  永不老
    ——歌曲《老人峰》听后
    虞文琴
    一位年轻的军人歌手，站在华灯灿烂的舞台上，神情庄严地唱着一座《老人峰》。这是来自南国广州的战士歌舞团为金秋时节的北京舞台带来的一支新歌。
    显然，这不是一首黄土滚滚的西北风，也不是普通的风光歌曲，更不是受欧美“蓝调”音乐影响而对大自然低吟浅唱的歌。它是一首被歌曲创作者们称之为大题材的作品。倾听它，回味它，心中升起的是山峰般的凝重之情。
    老人峰，是有着不屈灵魂的山峰。它的双肩落满了风霜雨雪，它的心头积压着沉沉岁月。冰雪的白发、沟壑的皱纹，经历了一切懂得一切洞察一切，却“默默地站在云雾中。”据说，初稿时，作者写的是老人峰“默默地藏在云雾中，”后来将“藏”字改为“站”字。这一字使老人峰有了精神。
    词作家瞿琮没有在这里寻求新奇的比喻，也没有使用令人费解的语言，只是倾吐着心中的情绪和感觉。别致的构思、贴切的象征、简练的铺陈，着力表现老人峰的神韵和伟力。他说：“从历史角度来看，人民，或者一个民族，尽管遭受许多灾难，却永不会被摧毁。”老人峰，不就是中华民族的象征吗？背负五千年历史，面对广阔世界，能够冷静理智地把握现实，把握未来，这正是我们充满希望的古老民族的象征。
    山峰即是人民，人民即是山峰。高尔基曾说：“人是要大写的。”词曲作家索兴把抽象的大写化作立地顶天的山峰，借以歌颂人民的伟大与尊严、人民的意志和力量。
    作曲家涂光极有着很好的感受力和表现力。他运用古朴的西北民歌音调为素材，在旋律中注入时代的色彩，注入自己的思想和感受。深情而不失苍劲，优美而不乏雄浑，传神地传达了歌词的内涵，为生机蓬勃的老人峰增添了风采。
