Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati said on the 24th in a speech to students at Tehran University that Iran will not unilaterally release Iraqi prisoners of war if Iraq does not take any measures. Velayati demanded that the International Committee of the Red Cross register all Iranian prisoners of war in Iraq.

It is estimated that Iran and Iraq are holding a total of 100,000 prisoners of war from each other. However, since the two countries ceased fire in August 1988, only fewer than 2,500 injured and disabled personnel have been repatriated.

    伊朗拒绝单方面释放战俘
    伊朗外长韦拉亚提二十四日在对德黑兰大学学生发表讲话时说，在交换战俘问题上如果伊拉克方面不采取任何措施，伊朗是不会单方面释放伊拉克战俘的。
    韦拉亚提外长要求红十字国际委员会登记在伊拉克的所有伊朗战俘。
    据估计，伊朗和伊拉克关押的双方战俘共计十万人。但自两伊一九八八年八月停火以来，其中只有不到二千五百名伤残人员得以遣返回国。
