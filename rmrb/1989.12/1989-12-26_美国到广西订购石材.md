The stone trade between China and the United States, which had once been sluggish, has recently shown signs of recovery. The Guangxi Southern Stone Products Co., Ltd. has begun to accept large orders from American companies.

This year, during the Canton Fair, American customers placed orders with this stone company totaling over $1.4 million. However, due to economic sanctions imposed by the United States on China, the contracts had to be suspended. Recently, several American customers have come to inspect or place orders.

    美国到广西订购石材
    新华社南宁12月25日电（通讯员杨俊义）今年曾一度萧条的中美石材交易，最近出现复苏趋势。广西南方石材制品有限公司开始接受美国公司大量订货。
    今年广州春交会上，美国客户曾向这家石材公司订货达140多万美元。后来因美国对中国实行经济制裁订购合同被迫中止。近来，好几家美国客户陆续前来考察或看样订货。
