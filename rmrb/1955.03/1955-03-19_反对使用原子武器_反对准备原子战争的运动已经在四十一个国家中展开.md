Against the Use of Atomic Weapons
    A Movement Against Preparing for Atomic Warfare Has Unfolded in Forty-One Countries
    Pan Gu Liayev, Secretary of the World Peace Council, wrote in "Pravda" on the 13th that the movement against preparing for atomic warfare has unfolded in forty-one countries. Everywhere, conferences are being held, and peace activists are going door-to-door to collect signatures for the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world.

    The signature campaign in the Soviet Union will begin on April 1st. In democratic camp countries such as the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, the movement is developing smoothly.

    The struggle of the people in capitalist countries against the threat of atomic war is also unfolding.

    The author concludes by writing that the world peace movement is embarking on this new international campaign based on six years of solid experience in striving for peace. The increasing organization of peace movements in various countries and their expanding influence are guarantees that will enable this movement to proceed smoothly. The people of all countries will certainly be able to stop the threat of atomic war. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    世界和平理事会书记潘·古利亚耶夫十三日在“真理报”上撰文指出，反对准备原子战争的运动已经在四十一个国家中展开了。到处都在举行大会，和平战士挨家挨户去为世界和平理事会告全世界人民书征集签名。
    苏联的签名运动将在四月一日开始。在中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国等民主阵营的国家，运动正在顺利地发展中。
    资本主义国家人民反对原子战争威胁的斗争也在展开。
    作者最后写道，世界和平运动是在六年来坚强的争取和平的斗争的经验的基础上，着手进行这个新的国际运动的。各国和平运动日益加强的组织性和它们日益扩大的影响是使这一运动能够顺利地进行的保证。各国人民一定能够制止原子战争的威胁。　（据新华社讯）
