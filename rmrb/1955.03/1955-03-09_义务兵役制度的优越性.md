The draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, after being discussed and revised by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has been issued by the State Council to people's committees at all levels for discussion and to solicit opinions from the people. After being discussed and approved by the next meeting of the National People's Congress, it will become a formal law, and our country will gradually implement a compulsory military service system in accordance with the law.

Since its establishment, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has implemented a voluntary military service system for more than 20 years. Why are we implementing a compulsory military service system today?

As everyone knows, in the stage of the new democratic revolution, the Chinese people carried out a long period of armed struggle. Chairman Mao said that armed struggle is one of the three magic weapons of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Stalin said: "In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. This is one of the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution." In order to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, and seize power, the Chinese people must rapidly expand their armed forces and ensure that their troops have a constant supply of soldiers to ensure the victory of the revolutionary war. However, how can we expand the troops and ensure the supply of soldiers? The conscription system is actually a mercenary system, which we cannot adopt because it is incompatible with the class nature and goals of our people's revolutionary army, and it cannot meet the requirements of the people's revolutionary war. Adopting a conscription system, that is, a compulsory military service system, is a good way, but the conditions at the time did not allow us to do so. At that time, we did not have a unified national government, the revolutionary base areas were divided by the enemy, and battles were frequent. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for us to implement a conscription system, that is, a compulsory military service system, and we could only adopt a voluntary military service system to ensure the replenishment and expansion of the troops. The voluntary military service system we implemented was based on the conscious and voluntary participation of the broad masses of people. It relied on political slogans such as "everything for the front line, everything for the victory of the revolutionary war," "striving for liberation," and "defending the fruits of victory" to mobilize the masses, relying on the leadership of party and league members and activists to mobilize young people to join the army; or by developing militia into district squadrons and county battalions, and reorganizing district squadrons and county battalions into local corps, and then upgrading local corps into main corps to expand the troops; or by mobilizing prisoners of war who were originally working people to join our army. This voluntary military service system reflects the class nature of our revolutionary army. It is the inevitable product of the people's revolutionary war. For their own liberation and to defend their fruits of victory, the broad masses of people, regardless of ethnicity or gender, participated in our army in large numbers. They were willing to shed blood and sacrifice themselves, and were not afraid of difficulties and hardships, dedicating themselves to the revolutionary cause and carrying out a long and heroic struggle. More than 20 years of armed struggle history prove that it was correct for us to implement a voluntary military service system at that time. First, it guaranteed the replenishment of soldiers and the expansion of the troops, and enabled our army to train a large number of outstanding commanders and political workers at all levels from actual struggles. Because the commanders and fighters of our army all came from the people and were for the people, they developed the fine tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the army and the people. Second, the voluntary military service system cultivated the fine tradition of the broad masses of people consciously joining the army. In the mobilization campaigns to join the army over the years, many model examples emerged of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers competing to join the army. This conscious action of joining the army educated the broad masses of people, changed the old concept of "good sons do not become soldiers, and good iron is not used to make nails" among the broad masses of people, and established a new concept of joining the army being glorious. Third, in the past revolutionary wars, our adoption of a voluntary military service system to mobilize people to join the army, in contrast to the Kuomintang reactionaries' methods of grabbing soldiers and drafting men to force people to join the army, served as a clear contrast, which also played a role in disintegrating the enemy politically. Therefore, in the stage of the new democratic revolution, when the country was not unified and was in a state of tense war, it was necessary and correct to implement a voluntary military service system.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese revolution has entered the stage of socialist revolution from the stage of new democratic revolution. In this new historical period, on the one hand, the people of the whole country demanded that our country be built into a great socialist country through peaceful means. Gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization has become the central task of the people of the whole country. In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, a large amount of funds is required, and appropriately reducing the number of active troops and saving manpower and financial resources will greatly contribute to increasing funds for the country's socialist industrial construction. On the other hand, the imperialist encirclement situation still exists, and they are constantly carrying out war provocations against our country, threatening our national security; the resolute counter-revolutionary elements among the classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated domestically will inevitably collude with imperialism to carry out various sabotage activities, attempting to undermine our country's socialist construction. In order to defend the security of the motherland and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, we must strengthen our national defense forces, and we must build the Chinese People's Liberation Army into the best modern revolutionary army and provide our army with a strong reserve force that has been trained. This new situation requires our army to be built into the best modern revolutionary army and to have a strong reserve force, and it also requires our army construction to be adapted to the construction of socialist industry, appropriately reducing the number of active troops. This is a new problem, what should we do? The past voluntary military service system can only solve the problem of replenishing soldiers and expanding the troops, but it cannot accumulate a strong reserve force for the troops. Therefore, a compulsory military service system must be used to replace the voluntary military service system.

Today, the whole country has been unified. After a series of social reforms in the past few years, the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. In particular, the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the promulgation of the constitution, and the propaganda of the general line have greatly improved the political consciousness of the people of the whole country. Under such circumstances, the implementation of a compulsory military service system is not only necessary but also possible.

So, what are the advantages of the compulsory military service system? I think the main ones are as follows:

(1) Implementing a compulsory military service system can accumulate a strong reserve force for the country, so that the country can maintain fewer troops in peacetime and deploy more troops in wartime.

In the past revolutionary war period, our army needed to be constantly expanded. The more troops there were, the larger the liberated area would be, and the more consolidated the revolutionary regime would be. In order to meet the needs of the war, troops could be developed and expanded in a decentralized manner in various places. Now that our country is in a period of peaceful construction, the construction of the troops must be adapted to the country's economic construction. The number of active troops is not to be expanded but to be appropriately reduced. Without a strong reserve force, even if the number of troops is not reduced in peacetime, it still cannot meet the needs of future national defense construction. Therefore, what we require today is: to maintain fewer troops in peacetime in order to save military expenditures and adapt to the country's peaceful construction situation; and to deploy more troops when imperialism invades in order to meet the needs of wartime and ensure the victory of the anti-aggression war. To achieve such requirements, we can only implement a compulsory military service system. By implementing a compulsory military service system, a new batch of soldiers will enlist every year, and at the same time, a batch of veteran soldiers will retire and transfer to the reserve, so that after several years, a large number of reserve soldiers can be accumulated for the country. In order to defend against imperialist aggression, we must be fully prepared in peacetime. Defeating the enemy requires strength. It is impossible to do without sufficient strength. Whoever has strong strength can achieve victory. Strength includes both people and weapons. In addition to modern weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and artillery, it is even more necessary to have people who can use these weapons. Whether the people who master the weapons have a high degree of political awareness, whether they have military skills, and whether they are proficient in using weapons are the decisive factors in the success or failure of the war. Now we are implementing a compulsory military service system, training the reserve soldiers well, accumulating them, and preparing them, which is called accumulating reserve strength. Only by implementing a compulsory military service system can we accumulate such a large number of trained reserve forces, can our country maintain fewer troops in peacetime and deploy more troops in wartime, and can we be more confident in defending against imperialist aggression and defending the security of the motherland.

(2) Implementing a compulsory military service system, with a fixed term of service, can enable the broad masses of people to reasonably share the military service obligation, and can also solve unreasonable problems in the troops.

In the past, the voluntary military service system was correct and appropriate, but because it had neither a fixed term of service nor a unified conscription system, some unreasonable phenomena were formed. For example, some areas sent more soldiers, while others sent fewer; some people served as soldiers for a lifetime, while others wanted to be soldiers but could not be soldiers for a lifetime. This phenomenon is unreasonable. In the past long-term revolutionary war, in order to defeat the enemy and overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary faction, it was possible to do so. Because at that time, the reactionary rule of the enemies at home and abroad was very cruel, the masses in the liberated areas, in order to defend their hometowns and strive for liberation, were determined to fight the enemy desperately, and automatically joined the Liberation Army; the people in the non-liberated areas, under the cruel oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary rule, were also "forced to go to Liangshan," and automatically joined the guerrillas of the Liberation Army. In such a situation of struggle, it was impossible for us to stipulate the term of service, let alone have a unified conscription system. Today, the whole country is unified, and the past phenomenon of uneven distribution of military service burden must and can be changed. By implementing a compulsory military service system, with a term of service of three, four, or five years, all eligible citizens across the country must perform military service in accordance with the law. This will not only enable young people to take turns serving the motherland and reasonably share the military service obligation, but also enable the volunteer soldiers in the troops to be demobilized in batches, so that their long-standing unresolved problems such as marriage and employment can be reasonably resolved.

(3) Implementing a compulsory military service system, since it can enable the country to maintain fewer troops in peacetime and deploy more troops in wartime, it can also save military expenditures, which is conducive to national construction.

To realize socialist industrialization, we must invest a large amount of construction funds, and we must save expenditures and accumulate funds from all aspects. By implementing a compulsory military service system, with more reservists, the number of active troops can be reduced, which can reduce the country's military expenditures, and can also reduce a large amount of demobilization expenses. Because in the future they will all be compulsory soldiers, the demobilization fee will not need to be so much. Therefore, implementing a compulsory military service system can enable the country to spend less money and accumulate more reserve soldiers, which is conducive to the country's industrial construction. National industrialization can also fully guarantee the modernization of our army's weapons and equipment and material supply.

(4) Implementing a compulsory military service system can not only accumulate reserve soldiers for the country, but also accumulate reserve officers for the country.

In order to meet the needs of modern national defense construction, it is necessary not only to have a large number of high-quality reserve soldiers, but also to have a large number of reserve officers with modern military command skills. Relying only on the training in active troops and military schools is not enough to train officers. By implementing a compulsory military service system, university students and cadres in state organs and enterprises who are suitable for military work can be trained as reserve officers. In this way, the implementation of a compulsory military service system not only enables many cadres to have a certain ability in social occupations, but also to have the military skills to defend the motherland. Once imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, they can go to the front line in large numbers to attack the enemy.

(5) Implementing a compulsory military service system can also accelerate the regularization of the troops and enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops.

In order to build our army into the best modern revolutionary army, we must first regularize it, that is, implement various regular systems, such as the salary system, the military rank system, and the regular military training system. Implementing a compulsory military service system is to establish a regular and complete system of soldier replenishment, and only by implementing a compulsory military service system can other regular military systems be easily implemented, accelerating the regularization of the troops. Implementing a compulsory military service system can carry out regular conscription, regular discharge, and a fixed term of active service, and can be discharged after the term of service expires. In this way, on the one hand, the soldiers of the troops are always young, strong, and full of vigor; on the other hand, the soldiers' marriage and employment problems are not affected, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of soldiers can be further brought into play, further enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops.

(6) Implementing a compulsory military service system can reduce the burden of farming on behalf of military families and relief from the people and the government.

In the past, when we implemented the voluntary military service system, it was impossible to clearly stipulate who could be a soldier and who could be postponed. Therefore, many people who were the sole breadwinners of their families also joined the army and served in the army for a long time, and their family production and life had to rely on the people's farming on their behalf and the government's relief, especially the masses in the old liberated areas, who had a heavier burden of farming on behalf of military families. By implementing a compulsory military service system, it is stipulated that the sole breadwinner or only child who maintains family life may be exempted from active service in peacetime after being examined and approved by the military service committee of the directly-administered municipality, county, autonomous county, or city. This is not only a care for the production and life of the families of conscripted citizens, but also reduces the burden of farming on behalf of military families and relief from the people and the government.

(7) Implementing a compulsory military service system can not only enable the broad masses of young people to fulfill their glorious obligation of military service in the People's Liberation Army, but also improve their political awareness, military skills, and scientific and cultural knowledge.

The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting team, and also a socialist university. Many outstanding young people who serve in this army for three or five years not only enrich their military knowledge, but also improve their political awareness and cultural level, and their organizational and disciplinary skills will also be greatly enhanced. It is not too late to study or find employment after retirement, and they can play an active role in socialist construction. Because they have received military education and have been tempered by army life, they are highly vigilant, and can play a great role in suppressing bandits and special agents, protecting local security, protecting production and construction, and consolidating local political power.

(8) Implementing a compulsory military service system can further develop and consolidate the fine tradition of unity between the army and the people of the People's Liberation Army.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's army led and educated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and has the fine tradition of unity between the army and the people. Our army comes from the people and serves the people, is the sons and daughters of the people, and is the defender of the people's interests and happy life, so it can cherish the masses, closely contact the masses, and win the support of the broad masses of people. After the implementation of the compulsory military service system, a batch of young people enlist every year, and a batch of people who have served their term of active service retire, and after retirement they are both the masses and the reserve soldiers, so the connection between our army and the people will be closer and broader, and the glorious tradition of unity between the army and the people will be further developed and consolidated.

(9) Implementing a compulsory military service system can universally strengthen the national defense education and the education of people's heroism among the people, and enhance the people's will to defend the motherland.

Liberating Taiwan, defending against imperialist aggression, and defending the security of the motherland are not just matters for the army, but matters for the whole people, requiring the broad masses of people to have a high degree of political awareness and a strong will to fight. Some people think that fighting is a matter for the Liberation Army, which is wrong. If imperialism launches a war of aggression against our country, we must mobilize the whole people and contribute all our strength to win the victory of the war and defend the security of the motherland. To this end, it is necessary to conduct regular, universal, and in-depth patriotic education among the broad masses of people during the period of peaceful construction. Because in peaceful life, the masses may develop a sense of peace and complacency, which requires strengthening national defense education from all aspects. By implementing a compulsory military service system, we conduct regular conscription, regular discharge, and people serving in the reserve must also participate in collective training for a certain period of time. Students in senior high schools and above must also receive military training in schools. Through this series of regular and practical education, the patriotic consciousness of the broad masses of people will be further enhanced, and the people's heroism and the will to defend the motherland will be further strengthened.

In general, the compulsory military service system is advanced and superior. Its superiority is determined by the nature of our country, and by the essence of our armed forces belonging to the people and defending the interests of the people. In our country, the interests of the people are completely consistent with the interests of the country, and defending the motherland is defending the highest interests of the people, and military service is the glorious obligation of citizens. However, in capitalist countries, due to the reactionary nature of the capitalist system, the state power serves the interests of a few capitalists, and the army of capitalist countries is a tool for oppressing the people internally and carrying out aggression externally. The working people are forced to become soldiers, which has nothing to do with their own interests, and therefore cannot but be opposed by the broad masses of working people. Therefore, the compulsory military service system that we are going to implement is essentially different from the conscription system of capitalist countries. Our 600 million people have stood up and will never tolerate the aggressive policies and war provocations of U.S. imperialism. As Chairman Mao said: "As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!" In order to liberate Taiwan, in order to defend the security of the motherland, in order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, and in order to defend peace in Asia and the world, it is necessary to further strengthen the modernization of national defense forces, and the implementation of a compulsory military service system is an important measure to strengthen national defense forces. The people of the whole country should consciously fulfill their glorious obligation of military service and strive to strengthen the national defense forces to defend socialist construction.

    义务兵役制度的优越性
    傅秋涛
    中华人民共和国兵役法草案经全国人民代表大会常务委员会讨论并修正已由国务院发给各级人民委员会讨论和征求人民意见，经全国人民代表大会下一次会议讨论通过后，就成为正式的法律，我们国家就要依照法律规定，逐步实行义务兵役制了。
    中国人民解放军自建军以来，二十多年都是实行志愿兵制，为什么今天要实行义务兵役制呢？
    大家知道，在新民主主义革命阶段，我国人民曾经进行了长期的武装斗争，毛主席说过，武装斗争是中国革命三大法宝之一。斯大林同志说：“在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。这是中国革命的特点之一和优点之一。”我国人民，为了推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，夺取政权，就必须迅速扩大自己的武装部队，并保证自己的部队有源源不断的兵员补充，才能保证革命战争的胜利。但是，如何来扩大部队并保证部队的兵员补充呢？募兵制实际上是雇佣兵制，我们不能采用，因为它是与我们人民革命军队的阶级本质、奋斗目标不相符的，也不能适应人民革命战争的要求。采用征兵制即义务兵役制，这是个好办法，但当时的条件不许可我们这样做。当时我们没有全国统一的政权，革命根据地被敌人分割，战斗频繁，在这样的情况下，我们不可能实行征兵制即义务兵役制度，而只能采取志愿兵制度来保证部队的补充和扩大。我们所实行的志愿兵制，是建立在广大人民自觉自愿的基础之上的，是以“一切为了前线，一切为了革命战争的胜利”，“争取翻身解放”、“保卫胜利果实”等政治口号鼓动群众，依靠党、团员和积极分子的带头，动员广大青年参军；或者是由民兵发展为区中队、县大队，由区中队、县大队整编为地方兵团，由地方兵团再升级为主力兵团的办法扩大部队；或者是动员原是劳动人民的战俘参加我军。这种志愿兵制，反映了我们革命军队的阶级本质，它是人民革命战争的必然产物，广大人民为了自己的解放，为了保卫自己的胜利果实，不分民族、不分男女，都风起云涌地参加我军，他们不惜流血牺牲，不畏艰难困苦，献身于革命事业，进行长期的英勇斗争。二十多年的武装斗争历史证明，我们当时实行志愿兵制是正确的，首先，它保证了我军的兵员补充和部队的扩大，并使我军能从实际斗争中培养和锻炼出大批的优秀的各级指挥人员和政治工作人员；由于我军的指挥员和战斗员都是来自人民、为了人民，因而养成了官兵一致、军民一致的优良传统；其次，志愿兵制养成了广大人民自觉参军的优良传统。在历年的动员参军运动中，都出现了许多父母送子、妻送夫、兄弟相争参军的模范事例，这种自觉参军的行动，教育了广大人民，在广大人民群众中改变了“好儿不当兵，好铁不打钉”的旧观念，树立了参军光荣的新观念。再次，在过去革命战争中，我们采用志愿兵制来动员参军，同国民党反动派用抓兵、抽丁的办法来强逼人民当兵，成为一个显明的对照，这在政治上也起了瓦解敌人的作用。所以，在新民主主义革命阶段，全国未统一而又处在紧张的战争的情况下，实行志愿兵制是必要的和正确的。
    中华人民共和国成立后，中国革命已由新民主主义革命阶段进入社会主义革命阶段。在这个新的历史时期，一方面，全国人民要求通过和平的道路来把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。逐步实现国家社会主义工业化成为当前全国人民的中心任务。为了实现国家社会主义工业化就必须有大量的资金，而适当减少现役部队兵员，节省人力财力，对于为国家增加社会主义工业建设的资金是作用很大的。另一方面，帝国主义的包围形势依然存在，并不断地向我国进行战争挑衅，威胁着我们国家的安全；国内已被消灭的和将要被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，必然和帝国主义相互勾结进行各种破坏活动，企图破坏我国的社会主义建设。为了保卫祖国的安全，保卫社会主义建设的顺利进行，我们就必须加强我们的国防力量，必须把我国人民解放军建设成为一支最优良的现代化的革命军队，并使我们的军队有着强大的经过训练的预备兵员。这个新的形势，既要求我们的军队建设成为一支最优良的现代化的革命军队，并有着强大的预备兵员，又要求我们的军队建设要同社会主义工业的建设相适应，适当的减少现役部队员额。这是新问题，我们应该怎么办呢？过去的志愿兵制，它只能为部队解决兵员的补充和部队的扩大问题，但不能为部队积蓄强大的预备力量。因此就必须以义务兵役制来代替志愿兵制。
    今天，全国已经统一了，经过几年来一系列的社会改革，人民民主专政更加巩固了，特别是抗美援朝的胜利，宪法的公布，总路线的宣传，大大提高了全国人民的政治觉悟。在这样的情况下，实行义务兵役制不仅是必需，而且是可能了。
    那么，义务兵役制究竟有什么优越性呢？我认为主要的有以下几点：
    （一）实行义务兵役制，能为国家积蓄强大的预备兵员，使国家在平时养兵少，在战时出兵多。
    在过去革命战争时期，我们的军队需要不断地扩大，队伍愈多，解放区的地区就愈大，革命政权也就愈巩固。为了适应战争的需要，各地可以分散进行发展和扩大部队。现在我们国家处在和平建设时期，部队的建设必须同国家经济建设相适应，现役部队不是要扩大而是要适当减少。没有强大的预备兵员，即使在平时不减少军队数量，也还不能适应今后国防建设的需要。因此，我们今天的要求是：在平时要养兵少，以节省军费开支，适应国家和平建设的情况；在帝国主义侵略时就要出兵多，以满足战时的需要，保证反侵略战争的胜利。要达到这样的要求，就只有实行义务兵役制度。实行了义务兵役制度，每年都有一批新兵入伍，同时又有一批老兵退伍转入预备役，这样若干年之后，就能为国家积蓄大量的预备兵员。为了防御帝国主义的侵略，平时就必须有充分的准备。战胜敌人是需要力量的，没有足够的力量是不行的，谁的力量雄厚，谁就能取得胜利。力量包含人和武器两个方面，除了有飞机、坦克、大炮等新式武器以外，更需要有能使用这些武器的人。掌握武器的人，有没有高度的政治觉悟，有没有军事素养，使用武器是否熟练等，就是战争胜败的决定因素。现在我们实行义务兵役制，把预备兵员训练好，积蓄起来，准备好，这就叫做积蓄预备力量。也只有实行义务兵役制，才能积蓄这样大批经过训练的预备力量。才能使我们国家在平时养兵少，在战时出兵多。才能够更有把握地防御帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国的安全。
    （二）实行义务兵役制，服役有一定的年限，能使广大人民群众合理分担兵役义务，也能解决部队中不合理的问题。
    在过去，志愿兵制是正确的、适宜的，但由于它既没有一定的服役年限，又没有统一的征集制度，因而形成某些不合理的现象。如有的地区出兵多，有的地区出兵少；有的人当了一辈子兵，有的人愿意当兵而一辈子当不到兵，这种现象是不合理的。在过去长期革命战争中，为了战胜敌人，打倒蒋介石反动派，这样做是可以的。因为当时国内外敌人的反动统治非常残酷，解放区的群众，为了保卫自己的家乡，为了争取解放，决心要和敌人作拚命的斗争，都自动参加解放军；非解放区的人民群众，在蒋介石反动统治的残酷压迫下，也被“逼上梁山”，自动参加解放军的游击队。这样的斗争形势，我们是不可能规定服役年限，更不可能有统一的征集制度。今天全国统一了，过去兵役负担上的畸轻畸重现象，必须而且可以改变了，实行义务兵役制，服役年限为三、四、五年，全国适龄公民都要依法服兵役，这样不但能使广大青年轮流为祖国服务，合理分担兵役义务，而且部队中的志愿兵也就可以分批复员回去，他们长期未能解决的婚姻、就业等等问题就可以合理地解决了。
    （三）实行义务兵役制，既然能使国家在平时养兵少，战时出兵多，也就可以节省养兵经费的开支，有利于国家建设。
    我们要实现社会主义工业化，就必须投入大量的建设资金，就必须从各方面节省经费开支，积累资金，实行义务兵役制度，预备役多了，现役部队就可以减少，这样就可以减少国家养兵经费的开支，同时也可以减少大笔的复员经费。因为今后都是义务兵，复员费就不用那么多了。所以实行义务兵役制，可以使国家花的钱少，积蓄的预备兵多，有利于国家工业建设。国家工业化，又能使我军现代化武器装备和物资供应获得充分的保证。
    （四）实行义务兵役制度，不但能为国家积蓄预备兵员，而且能为国家积蓄预备军官。
    为了适应现代化国防建设的需要，不但要有数量多质量好的预备兵员，而且要有大量的具备现代化军事指挥艺术的预备役军官。对于军官的培养，只依靠现役部队和军事学校中培养是不够的。而实行义务兵役制就可以把大学的学生及国家机关、企业中适合于军事工作的干部培养为预备役军官。这样，义务兵役制的实行，不仅是使许多干部具有一定的社会职业的本领，而且还具有保卫祖国的军事本领，一旦帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，他们就可以大批上前线打击敌人。
    （五）实行义务兵役制度，还能加速部队正规化的建设，增强部队战斗力。
    为了把我军建设成为最优良的现代化的革命军队，就必须首先正规化，就是要实行各种正规制度，如薪金制、军衔制、正规的军事训练制度等等。实行义务兵役制，就是为了建立正规的完备的兵员补充制度，同时也只有实行义务兵役制，才便于实行其它正规的军事制度，加速部队的正规化建设。实行义务兵役制，就能进行定期的征集，定期办理退伍，服现役有了一定期限，服役期满就可以退伍。这样，一方面使部队的兵员永远是年青力壮、朝气蓬勃的；另一方面士兵的婚姻问题、就业问题都不受影响，更能发挥广大士兵的积极性，进一步增强部队的战斗力。
    （六）实行义务兵役制可以减轻人民群众和政府对军属的代耕和救济负担。
    过去我们实行志愿兵制的时候，那些人可以当兵，那些人可以暂缓，是不可能有明确规定的。所以许多是家庭中唯一劳动力的人，也参加军队，长期在军队中服务，他们的家庭生产和生活就不能不依靠人民群众的代耕和政府的救济，特别是老解放区的群众，为军属代耕的负担更重一些。实行义务兵役制，规定了维持家庭生活的唯一劳动力或者独子，经直辖市、县、自治县、市兵役委员会审查批准，在平时可以免服现役，这样，不仅是对应征公民家庭生产和生活上的照顾，而且也可以减轻人民群众和政府对军属代耕和救济的负担。
    （七）实行义务兵役制，不但可以使广大青年在人民解放军中履行服兵役的光荣义务，而且可以提高他们的政治觉悟、军事技术和科学文化知识。
    人民解放军永远是一个战斗队，同时也是社会主义的大学校。许多优秀青年在这个军队服役三、五年，不但军事知识丰富了，而且政治觉悟和文化水平也提高了、组织性、纪律性也会大大增强。退伍之后，就学、就业都不晚，而且在社会主义建设中能发挥积极作用。由于他们受过军事教育，经过军队生活的锻炼，警惕性高，对于镇压土匪特务，保卫地方治安，保护生产建设，巩固地方政权，都是能起到很大作用的。
    （八）实行义务兵役制，能够更进一步发展和巩固人民解放军军民团结的优良传统。
    中国人民解放军，是在中国共产党和毛主席领导和教养下的人民军队，有军民一致的优良传统。我们的军队是来自人民而又为人民服务的，是人民的子弟兵，是人民利益和幸福生活的保卫者，因而它就能够爱护群众，密切联系群众，获得广大人民群众的拥护和支持。实行义务兵役制之后，每年有一批青年入伍，又有一批服现役期满的人退伍，退伍之后又是群众，又是预备役军人，这样我军和人民群众的联系就更加密切和广泛，军民一致的光荣传统就会进一步地发展和巩固。
    （九）实行义务兵役制，能普遍地加强人民群众的国防教育和人民英雄主义的教育，增强人民保卫祖国的斗争意志。
    解放台湾，防御帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国的安全，不光是军队的事情，而是全民的事情，需要广大人民有很高的政治觉悟和坚强的斗争意志。有人认为打仗是解放军的事情，这是不对的。如果帝国主义向我国发动侵略战争，我们就要全民动员起来，贡献一切力量，才能争取战争的胜利，才能保卫祖国的安全。为此，就必须要在和平建设时期，对广大人民进行经常普遍深入的爱国主义教育。因为在和平生活中，群众是可能会滋长和平麻痹思想的，这就须要从各方面加强国防教育。我们实行义务兵役制，每年进行定期的征集，定期的退伍，服预备役的人在一定时间内也要参加集训，高级中学以上学校的学生，也要在学校内受军事训练，通过这一系列的经常的实际教育，广大人民的爱国主义觉悟将进一步地提高，人民英雄主义和保卫祖国的斗争意志将更进一步地增强。
    总的来说，义务兵役制是先进的优越的。它的优越性是由我们国家的性质决定的，是由我国的武装力量属于人民、保卫人民利益这一本质决定的。在我们国家里，人民利益与国家利益是完全一致的，保卫祖国就是保卫人民的最高利益，服兵役是公民的光荣义务。而资本主义国家，由于资本主义制度的反动本质，国家政权是为少数资本家利益服务的，资本主义国家的军队是对内压迫人民对外实行侵略的工具，劳动人民被迫当兵是与自己的利益毫不相干的，因而就不能不遭到广大劳动人民的反对。所以说，我们所要实行的义务兵役制，是与资本主义国家的征兵制有本质区别的。我国六万万人民已经站起来了，绝不能容忍美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争挑衅。正如毛主席所说：“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”为了解放台湾，为了保卫祖国的安全，为了保卫社会主义建设的顺利进行，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，就必须进一步加强现代化国防力量，而实行义务兵役制就是加强国防力量的重要措施。全国人民应自觉地履行服兵役的光荣义务，为加强保卫社会主义建设的国防力量而努力。
