The will of the German people to oppose the Paris Agreements cannot be changed
Gao Ji
    After four days of fierce debate, the West German Federal Parliament, manipulated by the reactionary majority of the Adenauer group, approved the Paris Agreements on the third reading on February 27th. This shows that the Adenauer group in West Germany, encouraged by the American and British aggressive blocs, has recklessly embarked on the path of long-term division of Germany and the restoration of West Germany as a hotbed of new wars in Europe. This approach by the Adenauer group not only violates the national interests of Germany, but also the common interests of the people of all European countries in safeguarding European security and world peace.
    The Paris Agreements, which rearm West Germany, are war treaties imposed on the German people by the American and British aggressive blocs and West German revanchists, and are completely incompatible with the will of the German people. The German people are firmly opposed to any attempt to remilitarize Germany. The people's votes held in East and West Germany in May and June 1954 clearly demonstrated the will of all German people to reject the "European Defense Community" treaty and the Bonn Treaty. As a substitute for the bankrupt "European Defense Community" treaty and the Bonn Treaty, the Paris Agreements have met with even more resolute opposition from all German people. The "Struggle Week" against the Paris Agreements, initiated by the German Communist Party on January 10th, was widely launched in various parts of West Germany. The "German Declaration" adopted by the mass meeting in Frankfurt am Main on January 29th, which opposed the Paris Agreements and strived for the restoration of German unification, was widely supported and endorsed by West German Communists, Social Democrats, workers, youth, and women. Under the call of the Presidium of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, the East German people designated February 24th as the National Struggle Day and launched a struggle against the Paris Agreements. Before the West German Parliament debated the Paris Agreements, the people of East and West Germany sent millions of letters, resolutions, and telegrams to the parliamentary groups and members of the West German Federal Parliament, demanding that they reject the Paris Agreements. This massive movement of the German people against the Paris Agreements frightened the Adenauer group, and they only dared to conduct the debate on the Paris Agreements in parliament under the "vigilance" of thousands of armed police. However, police terror could not stop the West German people from holding demonstrations against the Paris Agreements in Bonn during the days of the parliamentary debate.
    Therefore, it is very clear that although the reactionary majority of the Adenauer group in the parliament approved the Paris Agreements, this cannot change the German people's firm will to oppose the Paris Agreements. The German people will never approve the Paris Agreements.
    Having suffered from the disasters of two world wars launched by German militarism, the German people deeply understand that once the Paris Agreements, which aim to maintain the division of Germany and use West Germany as a base for launching new wars, are approved and implemented, and the revanchist forces in West Germany are rearmed, Germany will lose the possibility of restoring unification, and the German nation will once again be in danger of being pushed into the abyss of war. In order to restore Germany's unification on a peaceful and democratic basis, in order to make Germany a great power again and establish normal relations with all European countries, the German people demand that the peaceful resolution of the German question be sought through negotiations between the four major powers that bear special responsibility for the German question and direct contact between the German people themselves. The national aspirations of the German people have been greatly encouraged by the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to peacefully resolve the German question.
    The possibility of restoring German unification on a peaceful and democratic basis, thereby eliminating the danger of a new war in Europe, has always existed. However, the constant efforts made by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to achieve this as soon as possible have always been obstructed by the United States, Britain, France and other Western countries and the West German Adenauer group. They refused to accept or even evaded discussing the various concrete and reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. On January 15 this year, the Soviet government once again suggested in its statement that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union hold negotiations on the issue of restoring German unification, so that Germany could hold free all-German elections in 1955. The Soviet government also stated that it was possible to negotiate on the establishment of appropriate international supervision of free all-German elections, which the Western countries had always insisted on. The government of the German Democratic Republic supported the Soviet proposal, and Prime Minister Grotewohl also suggested on February 19 that in order to facilitate the convening of the four-power conference, the two parts of Germany should reach an agreement on holding free all-German elections in 1955. These new efforts by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have once again opened the road to restoring German unification. Broad sections of people in Europe and West Germany believe that the proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic should be taken seriously, and they demand that a four-power conference on the German question be held instead of approving the Paris Agreements. However, the Western countries and the Adenauer group once again stubbornly rejected these proposals. With the connivance of the Western countries, Adenauer hurriedly arranged for the Federal Parliament to approve the unpopular Paris Agreements in order to finally block the road to restoring German unification.
    In order to conceal the serious consequences that accepting the Paris Agreements would have for Germany, Adenauer did not hesitate to distort the facts in parliament and intimidate and deceive the members. He insisted that West Germany's fate "depends on our military alliance with the West." He also hypocritically said that as long as the Paris Agreements were approved, he would "do his best to promote universal disarmament." Everyone can see that this is a blatant lie. The Adenauer group is determined to act as a shock force for the Western countries' "crusade against Bolshevism," which will only bring new war disasters to West Germany. By allying itself militarily with the Western countries, the Adenauer group is forming an aggressive war alliance with West Germany, the United States, Britain, and others, with the spearhead pointing at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe. Since the Paris Agreements are treaties of war alliance, approving them will only intensify the arms race and will not be conducive to universal disarmament. This is clear to everyone.
    Adenauer openly stated in parliament that after the West German army joined the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, it would enable the bloc to adopt a so-called "forward strategy" of "defending Germany in the far east" by "using atomic bombs." In other words, the West German revanchists want to collude with the American and British blocs to invade the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies, including the German Democratic Republic. This once again proves that behind the Paris Agreements lies a huge war conspiracy against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe, as the Soviet Union has repeatedly pointed out. Once the West German "Defense Force" obtains the opportunity to rearm, the danger of a new war using atomic weapons breaking out in Europe will greatly increase.
    However, the aggressive fantasies of the American and British blocs and the West German revanchists will not catch the peace-loving people of all countries off guard. The Moscow Eight-Nation Conference has announced that once the Paris Agreements are approved, these countries will take all necessary measures to safeguard their own security and peace in Europe. The Chinese people firmly support the declaration of the Eight-Nation Conference and all the measures taken by these countries to safeguard their own security. Peace-loving countries have a huge force of unity, and if the American and British blocs and the West German revanchists dare to launch a war, they will inevitably be met with a devastating counterattack.
    Now, although the Paris Agreements have been approved by the West German Federal Parliament, the German people's struggle against the Paris Agreements has not ended but is further developing. The Paris Agreements still have to go through discussions and approval by the Senate, and in the Senate, Adenauer does not have a solid majority. The German people's continued struggle against the Paris Agreements is an important force in preventing the final approval and implementation of the plan to revive the West German Defense Force. It is the will of the people, not the aggressive fantasies of the American and British blocs and the West German revanchists, that determines the direction of historical development. The German people's just struggle against the revival of the West German Defense Force will continue to receive the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

    德国人民反对巴黎协定的意志是改变不了的
    高集
    西德联邦议院在阿登纳集团反动多数的操纵下，经过四天的激烈辩论后，已于二月二十七日三读批准了巴黎协定。这表明，西德的阿登纳集团在美英侵略集团的鼓励下，已不顾一切地走上了长期分裂德国和把西德恢复为欧洲新战争的温床的道路。阿登纳集团的这种做法，不但违反了德国的民族利益，而且也违反了欧洲各国人民保障欧洲安全和世界和平的共同利益。
    重新武装西德的巴黎协定是美英侵略集团和西德复仇主义者强加在德国人民头上的战争条约，它和德国人民的意志是毫不相容的。德国人民坚决反对使德国重新军国主义化的任何企图。一九五四年五、六月间在东西德举行的人民投票，清楚地表明了全体德国人民拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约和波恩条约的意志。作为破了产的“欧洲防务集团”条约和波恩条约的代替品的巴黎协定，遭到了全体德国人民更加坚决的反对。德国共产党发起的在一月十日开始的反对巴黎协定的“斗争周”，曾在西德各地广泛展开。一月二十九日美因河畔法兰克福群众大会所通过的反对巴黎协定、争取恢复德国统一的“德国宣言”，得到了西德的共产党人、社会民主党人、工人、青年和妇女的普遍支持和拥护。东德人民在民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团的号召下，把二月二十四日作为民族斗争日，展开了反对巴黎协定的斗争。在西德议会辩论巴黎协定前，东西德人民把上百万件信件、决议书和电报寄给西德联邦议院的议会党团和议员们，要求他们否决巴黎协定。德国人民反对巴黎协定的这种声势浩大的运动，使阿登纳集团感到惊恐，他们只有在成千的武装警察的“警戒”下，才敢在议会中进行关于巴黎协定的辩论。但是，警察的恐怖并没有能够阻止住西德人民在议会辩论的日子里在波恩举行的反对巴黎协定的示威。
    因此，事情很清楚，尽管阿登纳集团在议会中的反动多数批准了巴黎协定，但这并不能改变德国人民反对巴黎协定的坚决意志。德国人民是永远不会批准巴黎协定的。
    身受过德国军国主义两次发动世界大战的灾难的德国人民深深地懂得，目的在保持德国分裂、利用西德作为发动新战争的基地的巴黎协定一旦批准并付诸实施，西德的复仇主义势力重新武装起来，德国就会失去恢复统一的可能，并且德国民族将又一次有被推入战争深渊的危险。为了使德国在和平民主的基础上恢复统一，为了使德国重新成为一个大国，并和一切欧洲国家建立正常的关系，德国人民要求通过对德国问题负有特别责任的四大国的谈判和德国人民自己之间的直接接触，来谋求德国问题的和平解决。德国人民的这种民族愿望，由于苏联和德意志民主共和国为和平解决德国问题所作的不懈努力，而得到了巨大的鼓舞。
    在和平民主的基础上恢复德国统一，从而消弭欧洲方面发生新战争的危险，这种可能性是一直存在着的。但是，苏联和德意志民主共和国方面为了尽速实现这一点而进行的不断的努力，始终遭到美、英、法等西方国家和西德阿登纳集团的多方阻挠。它们拒不接受甚至规避讨论苏联和德意志民主共和国提出来的各种具体合理的建议。今年一月十五日，苏联政府在它的声明中又一次建议美、英、法、苏就恢复德国统一问题举行谈判，以使德国能够在一九五五年举行全德自由选举。苏联政府并表示，就西方国家所一直坚持的对全德自由选举建立适当的国际监督进行谈判是可能的。德意志民主共和国政府支持苏联的建议，格罗提渥总理在二月十九日并建议为了便利四国会议的召开，德国两部分应当就在一九五五年举行全德自由选举达成协议。苏联和德意志民主共和国的这些新的努力，再一次为恢复德国统一打开了道路。欧洲和西德的广泛阶层人士都认为应该认真地对待苏联和德意志民主共和国的建议，要求举行关于德国问题的四国会议而不要批准巴黎协定。但是，西方国家和阿登纳集团再一次顽固地拒绝了这些建议。在西方国家的共谋之下，阿登纳匆忙布置联邦议院批准不得人心的巴黎协定，以便最后堵死恢复德国统一的道路。
    为了掩饰接受巴黎协定对于德国所将产生的严重后果，阿登纳不惜在议会中歪曲事实，对议员们施行恐吓和欺骗。他硬说，西德的命运“有赖于我们在军事上和西方结盟”。他又伪善地说，只要批准巴黎协定，他就将“尽力来促进普遍裁军”。谁都看得出来这是弥天大谎。阿登纳集团决心充当西方国家“反对布尔什维克的十字军”的突击力量，这除了使西德招致新的战争灾祸之外，不会有其他的结果。阿登纳集团使自己和西方国家在军事上结盟，就是使西德和美、英等结成矛头指向苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平国家的侵略战争同盟。巴黎协定既然是战争同盟的条约，批准它就只会加剧军备竞赛，而不会有利于普遍裁军。这是任何人都可以看得清楚的。
    阿登纳在议会中就露骨地表示过，西德军队在加入了北大西洋侵略集团之后，就会使这个集团采取一种“用原子弹”来在“尽东的地方保卫德国”的所谓“前进的战略”。换句话说，就是西德的复仇主义者要在和美英集团结盟下来侵犯苏联和包括德意志民主共和国在内的欧洲人民民主国家。这就再一次证明了苏联所一再指出的，在巴黎协定的背后，隐伏着的是一个反对苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平国家的巨大战争阴谋。西德“国防军”一旦获得重新武装机会，就会使得在欧洲爆发一次新的使用原子武器的战争的危险大大增加起来。
    但是，美英集团和西德复仇主义者的侵略妄想，是不会使爱好和平的各国人民措手不及的。莫斯科八国会议已经宣布，一旦巴黎协定获得批准，这些国家将采取一切必要的措施，来保障自己的安全和欧洲的和平。中国人民坚决支持八国会议宣言和这些国家为保障自己的安全所采取的一切措施。爱好和平国家有着团结一致的巨大力量，美英集团和西德复仇主义者如果敢于发动战争，就一定会遭到毁灭性的反击。
    现在，巴黎协定虽然已经西德联邦议院批准，但是德国人民反对巴黎协定的斗争并没有结束而是在进一步开展中。巴黎协定还要经过参议院的讨论和批准，而在参议院中，阿登纳并没有巩固的多数。德国人民再接再厉的反对巴黎协定的斗争，是阻止最后批准和实施复活西德国防军计划的重要力量。决定历史发展方向的是人民的意志，而不是美英集团和西德复仇主义者的侵略妄想。德国人民反对复活西德国防军的正义斗争，将继续得到全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。
