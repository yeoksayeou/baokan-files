Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 29th: The 11th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East opened in Tokyo on the 28th. 160 delegates from 21 countries participated in the meeting. Observers included the representative from Czechoslovakia and Li Jiebo, representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting will discuss the economic situation in Asia, trade and transportation conditions, technical cooperation among countries in the Asian and Far East Economic Commission region, and economic cooperation between countries in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

The convening of this meeting has aroused great interest in Japanese business circles, because expanding Japan's foreign trade and abolishing existing restrictions are very necessary for Japan.

The Secretary-General of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, Lokanathan, pointed out in his opening speech that cooperation among countries in the Asian and Far East Economic Commission region is of great significance and possibility.

At the meeting on the afternoon of the 28th, the Soviet representative, Menshikov, spoke and suggested inviting representatives from the People's Republic of China to attend this session. He pointed out the role of the People's Republic of China in solving international problems and its important position in Asia. He said that the Soviet delegation believes that the People's Republic of China can make a significant contribution to the further development of the economies of Asian and Far Eastern countries. The Soviet delegation believes it must be stated that the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are illegally occupying China's seat and have no right to represent the Chinese people. At the same time, the Soviet delegation also suggested inviting representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in this session, because the South Vietnamese representatives currently attending this session cannot actually represent the entire country. The Soviet delegation also believes that the representatives of Syngman Rhee are illegally participating in this session because he cannot represent the entire Korea.

The Soviet representative's proposal to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China to participate in this session was supported by the delegations from India, Indonesia, and Burma. The Indonesian representative said that if this Asian country with a population of 600 million does not participate in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East meeting, this session cannot promote the interests of Asian and Far Eastern countries.

The American representative spoke against the Soviet proposal. The acting chairman of the meeting unreasonably ruled not to discuss the Soviet proposal.

    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议在东京开幕
    苏联代表建议邀请我国、越南代表参加
   【新华社二十九日讯】东京消息：联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会第十一届会议二十八日在东京开幕。参加会议的有来自二十一个国家的一百六十名代表。参加会议的观察员有捷克斯洛伐克代表和世界工会联合会代表李颉伯。会议要讨论亚洲的经济状况，贸易和交通状况，亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家的技术合作，亚洲、欧洲、拉丁美洲各国之间的经济合作等问题。
    这次会议的召开，引起了日本商界很大的兴趣，因为扩大日本的对外贸易和废除现在存在的限制，对日本来说非常必要。
    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会秘书长洛卡纳坦在开幕词中指出，亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家进行合作有很大的意义，也有很大的可能性。
    在二十八日下午的会议上，苏联代表曼希科夫发言建议邀请中华人民共和国代表出席这届会议。他指出中华人民共和国在解决国际问题方面所起的作用以及它在亚洲所处的重要地位。他说，苏联代表团认为，中华人民共和国能够对亚洲及远东国家经济的进一步发展作出重大的贡献。苏联代表团认为必须声明，蒋介石集团的代表占据中国的席位是非法的，他无权代表中国人民。同时，苏联代表团还建议邀请越南民主共和国的代表参加这届会议。因为目前出席这届会议的南越代表实际上并不能代表整个国家。苏联代表团也认为李承晚的代表参加这届会议是非法的，因为他不能代表整个朝鲜。
    苏联代表所提出的关于邀请中华人民共和国代表参加这届会议的建议，得到印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸代表团的支持。印度尼西亚代表说，如果这个拥有六亿人口的亚洲国家不参加亚洲及远东经济委员会会议，这届会议就不能促进亚洲及远东国家的利益。
    美国代表发言反对苏联建议。会议临时主席无理裁决不讨论苏联建议。
