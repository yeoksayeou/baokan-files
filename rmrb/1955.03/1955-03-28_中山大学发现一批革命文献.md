    Zhongshan University Discovers a Batch of Revolutionary Documents
    Guangzhou—When Zhongshan University Library was recently sorting through old books, it discovered a collection of valuable revolutionary documents. Among them are the Shanghai Marxist Society's publication "Communist," published in May 1921, "The Chinese Peasant" which first published Mao Zedong's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Record of the Massacre of Citizens by the Counter-Revolutionary Merchant Corps in Guangzhou" published by the Farmer-Worker Bi-weekly, as well as books and periodicals such as "New Construction," "New Youth," "The Road of Guangdong Workers" and "Plow." Most of these books and periodicals were published in Guangzhou during the First Revolutionary Civil War. After preliminary sorting, they have now been stored in a separate room.
