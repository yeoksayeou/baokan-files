    TASS Authorized to Refute Rumors
    No Negotiations Between the Soviet Union and the United States on the Issue of Publishing the Yalta Conference Documents
   [Xinhua News Agency, March 24th] TASS Moscow, March 23rd: TASS is authorized to refute the following rumors:
    Regarding the so-called "documents" published by the U.S. State Department concerning the Crimean Conference held in February 1945 by the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the United Press International correspondent in Washington, citing a State Department spokesperson, insisted that the Soviet government "agreed to publish these materials from the Yalta secret document archives." The UPI reporter also said: "When the Soviet Union's opinion was sought through diplomatic channels last year, the Soviet Union gladly agreed to publish these documents."
    TASS is authorized to declare that this UPI report citing the State Department spokesperson's remarks is inconsistent with the facts. It is already known that no negotiations have taken place between the Soviet Union and the United States on the issue of publishing the Yalta Conference documents, nor has the U.S. government raised the issue of publishing these documents with the Soviet government.

    塔斯社受权辟谣
    苏联和美国之间并未就公布雅尔塔会议文件问题作过任何谈判
   【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电：塔斯社辟谣如下：
    关于美国国务院公布一九四五年二月间苏联、美国和英国三国政府首脑举行的克里米亚会议的所谓“文件”一事，合众社驻华盛顿记者援引国务院发言人的话，硬说苏联政府“同意公布雅尔塔秘密文件档案里的这些材料”。合众社记者还说：“去年经由外交途径询问苏联的意见时，苏联欣然同意公布这些文件。”
    塔斯社受权声明，合众社这条援引国务院发言人的谈话的消息不符事实。已经知道，苏联和美国之间并没有就公布雅尔塔会议文件问题举行过任何谈判，同时美国政府也未曾向苏联政府提出关于公布这些文件的问题。
