Armored vehicles patrol the city. "L'Humanité" said that despite American support, Ngo Dinh Diem's power now effectively extends no further than his official residence. Conflicts between Bao Dai's troops and the armed forces of various sects have not ceased.

    南越局势仍然很紧张
    吴庭艳军队继续和教派武装冲突
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社巴黎十九日讯：“人道报”报道，南越政局依然很紧张。西贡政府所在地由大批军队守卫。装甲车在市内来往巡逻。“人道报”说，尽管美国给以支持，但是吴庭艳的权力现在事实上超不出他的官邸。保大军队和各教派的武装力量之间的冲突仍然没有停止。
    由于南越实施严格的新闻检查，最近几个月有二十家报纸和杂志被查封。
