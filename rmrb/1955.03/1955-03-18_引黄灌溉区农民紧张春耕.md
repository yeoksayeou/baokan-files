Farmers in the Yellow River irrigated areas of Xinxiang, Huojia, and other counties in Henan Province are busily engaged in spring production activities. Groups of young women are now diligently weeding wheat fields with newly made close-planting hoes to promote the greening and jointing of wheat. Cotton farmers are preparing to expand cotton fields. The wheat in the fourth district of Huojia County is about to be weeded for the second time. Tractor drivers at the Xinxiang Agricultural Machinery Station, located in the central part of the Yellow River irrigation area, are driving tractors with tine harrows and five-share plows to harrow the land for Qiliying Township and then plow the land for the Hezhuang Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative. Cooperatives that have not used tractors for plowing have plowed some land twice with double-wheeled double-share plows. Some elderly farmers are using the quick composting method in the villages, placing sorghum, corn stalks, and cotton leaves in pits to compost in order to supplement the shortage of manure this spring.

    引黄灌溉区农民紧张春耕
    河南省新乡、获嘉等县引黄灌溉区的春季生产活动已繁忙起来。现在小麦地里一群一群的青年妇女们正用新打的密植锄，精细地锄麦，促进小麦返青拔节。种棉农民都在为扩大棉田作准备。获嘉县四区的小麦，快要锄完第二遍了。位于引黄灌溉区中部的新乡农业机器站的拖拉机手们，开着拖拉机带着丁齿耙、五铧犁，给七里营乡耙完地以后，又给贺庄红旗农业生产合作社犁地去了。没有用拖拉机犁地的社，有的地也已用双轮双铧犁翻耕过二遍。一些年老的农民正在村子里用快速沤粪法，把高粱、玉米的秸秆和棉叶等放在坑里沤粪，以补今春粪土的不足。（据新华社讯）
