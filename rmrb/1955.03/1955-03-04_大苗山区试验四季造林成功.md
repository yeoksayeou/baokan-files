    Successful Four-Season Afforestation Experiment in the Great Miao Mountain Area
    The leadership in the Great Miao Mountain area of Guangxi Province, acting on the advice of Soviet experts, conducted a four-season afforestation experiment last year, which has now been successful. The Dong'an Township Forestry Cooperative planted 120 Chinese fir seedlings in late September last year, all of which survived and are growing well. In August last year, the Huang Guangxi mutual aid team mobilized its members to plant 225 Chinese fir trees, of which 206 survived. After the successful autumn afforestation experiment, winter afforestation was carried out on December 1st. The entire team planted 98 trees on a trial basis, all of which survived. After visiting the successful trial planting of the Huang Guangxi mutual aid team, Wei Laofu of Gui Shuang Village in Yao Liang Township returned home and also planted 220 Chinese fir trees on a trial basis, resulting in 210 surviving. Huang Guangjin, a forester who had no past experience with summer afforestation, planted 66 Chinese fir trees in late June last year, of which 60 survived; in August, the Huang Guangjin mutual aid team planted another 413 Chinese fir seedlings, of which 323 survived.
    Now, the forest farmers in this area are carrying out spring afforestation and cultivating ten mu of seedlings (with 1.5 million Chinese fir seedlings) to prepare seedlings for four-season afforestation in the coming years.

    大苗山区试验四季造林成功
    广西省大苗山地区领导上接受苏联专家的建议，在去年进行了四季造林的试验，现已成功。侗安乡林业社，去年九月下旬试种杉木苗一百二十株，全部活着，生长良好。去年八月黄光昔互助组发动本组组员试种二百二十五株杉木，活了二百零六株。秋季造林试验成功后，十二月一日又进行了冬季造林。全组试种九十八株，全部种活。尧良乡规双屯韦老福参观了黄光昔互助组试种成功后，回家也试种了杉木二百二十株，结果活了二百一十株。过去没有夏季造林习惯的林农黄光金，在去年六月下旬试种杉木六十六株，活了六十株；八月间，黄光金互助组又试种了四百一十三株杉木苗，活了三百二十三株。
    现在这个地方的林农正在进行春季造林，并育苗十亩（有一百五十万株杉苗），为明年后年四季造林作好苗木准备工作。
