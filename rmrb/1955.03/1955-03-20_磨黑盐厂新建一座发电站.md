A new power station built at the Mohei Salt Factory in Yunnan Province officially went into production on February 10th. In the past, the factory's production was very irregular and could not meet the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas. After the power station officially went into production, the factory has been able to use machines to supply brine entirely. Other operations, such as lighting in the salt wells, pneumatic drilling, hoisting, and crushing salt rocks, also utilize the electricity from the new power station, thereby making the factory's production increasingly normal.

This power station also supplies electricity for lighting to government offices and some residents.

In the construction of this power station, the workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. Before the road to the power station was completed, the workers carried machines weighing more than ten tons to the site on their shoulders.

    磨黑盐厂新建一座发电站
    云南省磨黑盐厂新建的发电站，已于二月十日正式投入生产。过去，这个工厂的生产很不正常，不能满足边疆各族人民的需要。发电站正式投入生产后，这个工厂已能全部用机器供应卤水。其他如硔硐照明和风钻打硔、卷扬、碎硔等操作也都利用新建发电站的电力，从而使全厂的生产日趋正常。
    这个发电站还供应机关和部分居民的照明用电。
    在建设这个发电站中，工人们发挥了很高的劳动热情。在通往发电站的道路未修通以前，工人们用肩头把十几吨重的机器抬到现场。
