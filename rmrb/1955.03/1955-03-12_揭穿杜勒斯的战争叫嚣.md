　　Exposing Dulles's War Mongering

　　Dulles's speech in Washington on the 8th shows that the purpose of his activities in Bangkok, Indochina, Taiwan, and other places is to enslave the Asian people and push them into the war pit planned by the United States.

　　Dulles's speech began by regarding Asia as the "front line" for the United States to carry out its war of aggression. Here, the spearhead of American aggression is first aimed at the 600 million Chinese people. Dulles clamored for a "total war" against China from the "south, middle, and north" surrounding China, that is, from Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Korea. He regarded these three fronts "as a whole," attempting to intimidate the Chinese people with America's so-called "deterrent force."

　　Dulles reiterated the United States' determination to invade and occupy Taiwan, Penghu, and China's coastal islands. He also mentioned the consultations between the US Chief of Naval Operations Carney and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. It is well known that, according to these consultations, a joint command will be established between the United States and Chiang. The United States will strengthen its aid to Chiang. Chiang is also strengthening his military power on the coastal islands with the assistance of the United States. Dulles also stated that he intends to create so-called "ceasefires" or use the United Nations for "ceasefire" tricks to divide Chinese territory, expand aggression, and prepare for new wars. Dulles is well aware that his war cries and war intimidation will arouse the anger of the Chinese people and the vast majority of people in Asian countries. Therefore, he ordered the United States Information Service to lie, saying that his war cries were a "call to reconcile the explosive situation."

　　It must be told to Dulles that no matter how the United States clamors or deceives, the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands will never change. War maniacs can never intimidate the Chinese people.

　　It should be pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Eden, regardless of the fact that the United States is strengthening its military power in Taiwan to prepare for war, attempted to prove that the United States "hopes to ease tensions and reduce the danger of war." It is clear that China supports the Soviet Union's proposal for a ten-nation conference to discuss the Taiwan situation, but Eden said that based on the information he obtained regarding the Chinese government's attitude, he believes that the necessary conditions for holding an international discussion on the Taiwan issue do not yet exist. This shows that he wants to discuss the so-called "status issue" of Taiwan at an international conference, thereby interfering in China's internal affairs, and he is once again attempting to put the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on an equal footing. Eden's attitude is to cover up the United States' war conspiracy and fuel American aggression.

　　Judging from Dulles's speech, it seems that because the "vast Pacific Ocean" prevents the United States from quickly realizing this dream of invading China, he expressed his intention to use "various joint security treaties" to form military blocs to control Asia, so as to turn Asia into another Latin America under American control and use Asian manpower and resources for wars of aggression.

　　The Southeast Asia Treaty is such a tool.

　　Dulles unreservedly stated that the so-called "economic mission" of the Southeast Asia Treaty is primarily "how to raise funds for more elite security forces," which is to raise funds to train Asian troops to fight for the United States. He also stated that the United States "will use the method of providing certain military equipment and financial support" to realize "Asians fighting Asians."

　　Dulles clamored for the use of American naval and air forces to carry out war provocations in Asia. He threatened that the US naval and air forces would use so-called "new and powerful elite weapons." Washington officials, in explaining this sentence, said that Dulles's so-called new weapons are atomic weapons.

　　According to Dulles's calculations, the Asian people will bear the brunt of the American war of aggression, and Asia will become the battlefield for the American war of aggression. But Dulles has forgotten that most parts of Asia are no longer the rear of imperialism, and the Asian public opinion's angry condemnation of "Asians fighting Asians" shows that Dulles's calculation is unfounded.

　　Today, when the strength of the Chinese people is growing stronger and stronger, and when China, the Soviet Union, and all the people's democratic countries are united as one, Dulles still attempts to scare people with so-called "new weapons" and "total war," which shows the extent of his war madness.

　　In preparation for war, the United States is now particularly focused on Indochina, trying to undermine the Geneva Accords. Dulles clearly exposed this conspiracy when talking about his trip to Indochina.

　　Dulles reiterated that Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam are all regions "within the scope" of the Southeast Asia Treaty, and tried their best to pull them all into this military alliance. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly in Laos are areas where the Lao fighting forces are concentrated. Dulles openly demanded that the Lao government "restore" its "control" over these two provinces. According to the Geneva Accords, the Lao fighting forces should gather in the aforementioned two provinces and participate in the upcoming national general election. However, Dulles falsely accused them of being "disloyal elements" and demanded that the Lao government "suppress" them, which is to attack the Lao fighting forces. He also openly used the Southeast Asia Treaty to counter the Geneva Accords, declaring that the Lao government could receive the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty when doing so. This shows that Dulles completely disregards the Geneva Accords and attempts to tear them up and turn Laos into a US military base.

　　Similarly, when talking about Vietnam, Dulles exposed his attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct the national reunification of Vietnam. When talking about the general election scheduled to be held in Vietnam in 1956, he insisted that "it would be difficult to create conditions in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that would allow people to have a genuinely free choice." He attempted to create excuses for refusing to hold general elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords in this way. From his comparison of the situation in Vietnam with that of Korea and Germany, it can be seen that the United States' purpose is to undermine the general election and create a divided Vietnam situation, so that the United States can turn South Vietnam into an American base of aggression.

　　Dulles is hostile to the national independence movements of the Asian people. In his speech, he tried his best to make the Asian people lose confidence in their own future, making them feel that they have no way out except to rely on the United States and serve as cannon fodder for American wars of aggression. The Asian people believe that countries should have economic exchanges without hindering their independence and autonomy in the slightest. However, Dulles said that the Southeast Asian region "can never" be economically "independent and self-sufficient," in other words, it must always be an appendage of "strong countries" like the United States. Dulles's words only prove that the United States is attempting to continue to enslave the Asian people indefinitely.

　　In order to obstruct and undermine the national independence of Asian countries, the Bangkok Conference discussed the so-called "subversive activities" issue. Dulles tried his best to emphasize this point. He declared that so-called "expert conferences" would be held later to "exchange views on these subversion issues." Obviously, the United States will try its best to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries under the pretext of suppressing so-called "subversive activities," forcing Asian countries to comply with the will of the United States and offering their people to the United States as cannon fodder. The United States cannot tolerate Asian countries taking the path of independence and autonomy one after another.

　　The United States' war conspiracy is aimed at the Chinese people, and at the same time, it threatens the independence and security of the people of all Asian countries. This is the root cause of the increasingly tense situation in the Far East and Asia today. Even US Senator Morse believes that Dulles's speech will only cause greater tension in Asia. He accused Dulles of "carrying out the threats he made in his speech."

　　Dulles and various American civil and military officials have constantly made various war cries countless times. The American aggression group clearly realizes that its war conspiracy is unpopular and is opposed by peace-loving people around the world, including the American people. Therefore, it attempts to maintain war hysteria through continuous war threats and cries, and create a sense of war inevitability among the people, so that it can suddenly impose war on the people.

　　Peace-loving people all over the world will never allow the wishes of these war merchants to be fulfilled. The people will maintain a clear mind and a high degree of vigilance regarding the development of the situation. They must firmly grasp the cause of opposing war and defending peace in their own hands.

### 揭穿杜勒斯的战争叫嚣

    揭穿杜勒斯的战争叫嚣
    杜勒斯八日在华盛顿发表的演说，表明他在曼谷、印度支那、台湾等地的活动的目的，就是为了奴役亚洲人民和把亚洲人民推到美国所策划的战争火坑中去。
    杜勒斯的演说一开始就把亚洲看作是美国进行侵略战争的“前沿阵地”。在这里，美国的侵略矛头首先就是针对着六万万中国人民。杜勒斯叫嚣从环绕中国的“南部、中部和北部”、也就是从东南亚、台湾和朝鲜对中国进行“全面战争”。他把这三条战线“看作一个整体”，企图用美国的所谓“威慑力量”来吓倒中国人民。
    杜勒斯重申美国决心侵占台湾、澎湖和我国沿海岛屿。他还谈到了美国海军作战部长卡涅等和蒋介石卖国集团之间的会商。人所共知，根据这些会商，美蒋之间将建立联合司令部。美国将加强对蒋贼的援助。蒋贼并在美国协助下加强了在沿海岛屿上的军事力量。杜勒斯还表示他企图制造所谓“停火”或利用联合国进行“停火”的诡计来割裂中国领土，扩大侵略，准备新战争。杜勒斯深知他的战争叫嚣和战争恐吓会激起中国人民和亚洲各国绝大多数人民的愤怒，因此，他又令美国新闻处出来撒谎，说他的战争叫嚣是什么要“调和爆炸性局势的呼吁”。
    必须告诉杜勒斯，无论美国怎样叫嚣，怎样欺骗，中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿的决心是永远也不会改变的。战争狂人们永不能吓倒中国人民。
    应该指出，英国外交大臣艾登不顾美国正在台湾加强军事力量准备战争的事实，企图证明美国“希望缓和紧张局势并减少战争危险”。明明中国支持苏联建议的十国会议来讨论台湾局势问题，艾登却说由于他所得的关于中国政府的态度的情报，他认为举行关于台湾问题的国际讨论的必要条件还不存在。这表明他要在国际会议上讨论所谓台湾的“地位问题”，借此来干涉中国内政，他并且再次企图将中国人民和蒋介石卖国集团处于对等的地位。艾登的这种态度，就是替美国的战争阴谋作掩护，助长美国侵略。
    从杜勒斯的演说看，似乎由于“广阔的太平洋”妨碍美国迅速实现这个侵略中国的梦想，因此他表示要用“各项共同安全条约”组成军事集团来控制亚洲，以便把亚洲变成另一个美国控制下的拉丁美洲，利用亚洲的人力和资源进行侵略战争。
    东南亚条约就是这样的一个工具。
    杜勒斯毫不掩饰地表示，东南亚条约的所谓
  “经济任务”，首先就是“如何筹措更精锐的保安部队的费用”，也就是筹措训练替美国打仗的亚洲部队的费用。他还表示，美国“将用提供某些军事装备和财政支持的办法”来实现“亚洲人打亚洲人”。
    杜勒斯叫嚣要用美国的海空军来在亚洲进行战争挑衅。他恫吓说，美国海空军将使用所谓“新式和强有力的精锐的武器”。华盛顿人士在解释这句话的时候说，杜勒斯的所谓新式武器，就是原子武器。
    按照杜勒斯这个算盘，亚洲人民将替美国的侵略战争打头阵，亚洲将成为美国的侵略战争的战场。但是杜勒斯忘记了亚洲大部分地区已经不再是帝国主义的后方，亚洲舆论对于“亚洲人打亚洲人”的愤怒谴责，就说明杜勒斯的算盘并没有根据。
    在中国人民的力量越来越强大了的今天，在中国和苏联、各人民民主国家团结得像一个人一样的今天，杜勒斯还企图用所谓“新式武器”和“全面战争”来吓人，这说明他的战争狂到了什么地步。
    为了准备战争，美国现在特别着眼于印度支那，力图破坏日内瓦协议。杜勒斯在谈到他的印度支那之行的时候，清楚地暴露了这个阴谋。
    杜勒斯重申老挝、柬埔寨和南越都是在东南亚条约“范围以内”的地区，竭力要把它们都拉进这个军事联盟。按照日内瓦协议的规定，老挝的桑怒和丰沙里两省是寮国战斗部队集结的地区。杜勒斯却公开要求老挝政府“恢复”对这两省的“控制”。按照日内瓦协议，寮国战斗部队应该集结在上述两省并参加不久要举行的全国普选。而杜勒斯却诬称他们为“不忠诚分子”，要求老挝政府“镇压”他们，也就是进攻寮国战斗部队。他并公然用东南亚条约来对抗日内瓦协议，宣称老挝政府在这样做的时候可以受到东南亚条约的“保护”。这就表明杜勒斯完全不把日内瓦协议放在眼里，企图把它撕毁，把老挝变成美国的军事基地。
    同样，在谈到越南的时候，杜勒斯暴露了他企图破坏日内瓦协议、阻挠越南全国统一。他在谈到预定在一九五六年在越南举行的普选时，硬说要在越南民主共和国“创造可以让人们有真正选择的自由的条件会是困难的”。他企图这样来为拒绝按照日内瓦协议举行普选制造借口。从他拿越南和朝鲜、德国的情况相比拟可以看出，美国的目的是要破坏普选，制造分裂越南的局面，以便美国把南越变成美国的侵略基地。
    杜勒斯仇视亚洲人民的民族独立运动。他在演说中竭力企图使亚洲人民丧失对于自己前途的信心，使他们觉得除了依靠美国、替美国充当侵略战争的炮灰以外，别无出路。亚洲人民相信各国应该有经济交流而丝毫不妨碍各国的独立自主。但是，杜勒斯却说，东南亚地区“永远不可能”在经济上“独立自足”，换句话说，就是必须永远做美国这样的“强国”的附庸。杜勒斯的话只是证明了美国企图继续无限期地奴役亚洲人民。
    为了阻挠和破坏亚洲国家的民族独立，曼谷会议讨论了所谓“颠覆活动”问题。杜勒斯竭力强调这一点。他宣称以后要举行所谓“专家会议”来“交换关于这些颠覆问题的意见”。显然美国将在所谓镇压“颠覆活动”的借口下竭力干涉亚洲各国的内政，迫使亚洲国家顺从美国的意志，将它们的人民奉送给美国充当炮灰。美国是不能容忍亚洲国家一个又一个地走上独立自主的道路的。
  美国的战争阴谋针对着中国人民，同时它也威胁着各亚洲国家人民的独立和安全。这也就是今天远东和亚洲紧张局势日益加剧的根源所在。就是美国参议员莫尔斯也认为杜勒斯的演说只会引起亚洲更大的紧张局势。他指责杜勒斯“进行他演说中所提出的威胁”。
    杜勒斯和美国的各色文武官员经常不断地进行各种战争叫嚣，已经不知多少次了。美国侵略集团显然认识到，它的战争阴谋不得人心，受到了世界爱好和平人民，包括美国人民在内的反对，因此，它企图用不断的战争威胁和叫嚣来保持战争歇斯底里，并在人民中制造战争不可避免的心理，以便于它突然将战争强加在人民头上。
    全世界爱好和平的人民决不会容许这些战争贩子的愿望得到满足。人民将对局势的发展保持着清醒的头脑和高度的警惕。他们一定要把反对战争、保卫和平的事业坚决地掌握在自己手里。
