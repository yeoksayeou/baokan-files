    Xinjiang Province to Increase Irrigated Farmland Area
    This year, the state's investment in small-scale water conservancy construction for the masses in Xinjiang Province will increase by 236% compared to last year. This funding will be used to maintain existing canals and karez wells, assist the masses in building their own small-scale water conservancy projects, and to carry out construction projects for small reservoirs, canals, and flood control in Urumqi, Shache, Ili, and Aksu prefectures. These projects will increase the irrigated area by approximately 320,000 mu.
    In the past, when farmers in various parts of Xinjiang irrigated their fields, they often dug a hole in the ridges to let the water flow violently, allowing the water to flow from one field to another. This resulted in a great waste of water, with the higher ground not being irrigated well and the lower ground being flooded. To gradually change this situation, this year, in addition to establishing and improving water usage systems, various regions will promote centralized rotational irrigation and small furrow irrigation based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and will focus on piloting ditch irrigation.

    新疆省将增加农田灌溉面积
    今年，国家在新疆省用于群众小型水利建设的投资，比去年增加百分之二百三十六。这笔费用将用于做好已有渠道和坎儿井的岁修工作，扶助群众自办小型水利工程，并要在乌鲁木齐、莎车、伊犁和阿克苏等专区，分别举办一些小型水库、渠道和防洪的建设工程。这些工程共可增加灌溉面积约三十二万多亩。
    过去新疆各地农民在放水灌溉的时候，多在田埂上刨开一个口子，让水猛流，并让水从这一块田里流到另一块田里，结果使水浪费很大，田地的高处灌不好，低处反而被淹。为了逐步改变这种情况，今年各地除建立和健全用水制度外，还以互助合作组织为基础，推行集中轮灌和小畦灌溉，并重点试办沟灌。　（新华社）
