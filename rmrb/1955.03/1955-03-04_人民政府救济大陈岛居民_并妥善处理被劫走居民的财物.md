Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Frontline, March 3rd: The working team dispatched by the Wenling County People's Committee of Zhejiang Province to Dachen Island has swiftly resettled and provided relief to Dachen Island residents rescued from nearby desolate islands. They have also properly handled the houses, fields, furniture, and materials left behind by the residents who were abducted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.

The staff stationed on Dachen Island to carry out the takeover work posted proclamations of the "Eight-Point Agreement" issued by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee and the Zhejiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They comforted the rescued residents and distributed relief supplies such as rice, oil, salt, sauce, and vegetables. The Haimen District branch of the People's Bank of China, Zhejiang Province, specially sent personnel to the island to exchange currency for the residents. China Department Store, Xinhua Bookstore, and the Haimen District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Zhejiang Province also established branches and sub-branches on the island, enabling residents to freely purchase what they needed.

The staff of the People's Government also properly handled the private property of the residents who were abducted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. With the assistance of the rescued island residents, they cleared the civilian houses damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops and the scattered materials, house by house, mountain by mountain. They washed and dried the damp and moldy items, registered all the items in detail by household, and then nailed wooden boards on the broken glass windows and doors. They posted seals with the signature of the People's Government and the words "Protect Private Property," waiting for their owners to return and return them.

The rescued island residents are extremely grateful for the People's Government's proper resettlement, relief, and protection of people's property. Resident Hong Chen said:
　“I have never seen such a good government that serves the people.”

    人民政府救济大陈岛居民
    并妥善处理被劫走居民的财物
    【新华社浙江前线三日电】浙江省温岭县人民委员会派驻大陈岛的工作队已迅速安置和救济了从附近荒岛上获救的大陈岛居民，并妥善地处理了被蒋贼军劫走的居民所遗留下的房田、家具和物资。
    派驻大陈岛进行接管工作的工作人员，在岛上张贴了浙江省人民委员会和中国人民解放军浙江军区“约法八章”的布告，慰问了获救的居民，并给他们发放了大米、油、盐、酱、菜等救济品。中国人民银行浙江省海门区支行特地派员携带人民币到岛上为居民兑换了货币。中国百货公司、新华书店和浙江省海门区供销合作社也在岛上设立了分、支机构，使岛上居民能够随意购买自己所需要的东西。
    人民政府的工作人员还妥善地处理了被蒋贼军劫走的居民的私人财产。他们在获救的岛上居民的协助下，挨山逐户地清理了被蒋贼军破坏的民房和弃散的物资，把潮湿和发霉的物品进行了洗晒，并把所有的物品按户进行了详细登记，然后在破碎的玻璃窗上和门上钉上了木板，贴上了人民政府署名的并写有“保护私人财产”字样的封条，等待它们的主人回来后发还给他们。
    获救的岛上居民对人民政府妥善的安置、救济和保护人民财产的行动，都感激万分。居民洪琛说：
  “我从来没见过这样好的为人民服务的政府。”
