	Cannot "Hope for Reader's Understanding"
	Gao Xi
	Many factory and mine newspaper editorial departments believe that it doesn't matter if errors occur in factory and mine tabloids, their reasoning being, "Our tabloid's circulation is not wide, the impact of newspaper errors is small." This statement is extremely wrong and harmful. One of the important tasks of factory and mine newspapers is to convey the Party's policies and instructions to the worker masses, and to have the worker masses act in accordance with these policies and instructions. In this context, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of impact each newspaper error will have.
	This view towards errors weakens the newspaper editorial department's struggle against errors in the newspaper, it erodes the political responsibility of the newspaper staff, thus causing some major political errors, mixed with general technical errors, to appear in large numbers in some newspapers. In this regard, the organ newspaper of the Communist Party of China Jiaohe Mining Bureau Working Committee – Jiaohe Miner's News is a more prominent example.
	Jiaohe Miner's News often has typos appearing on its pages, some of which are major political errors. For example, in an article in the 69th issue of the newspaper, when quoting the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," the word "征" (zhēng, solicit) in the sentence "即令并未征求或并未征得被批评者的同意" (jí lìng bìng wèi zhēngqiú huò bìng wèi zhēngdé bèi pīpíng zhě de tóngyì, even if the consent of the criticized party has not been sought or obtained) was mistakenly written as "曾" (céng, once), which made it completely impossible to understand what the sentence meant. This certainly cannot be said to be "unimportant." However, instead of seriously examining and actively finding ways to correct this error, the newspaper emphasized objective difficulties to indulge it, and even openly published a notice in the 90th issue of the newspaper stating: "Due to... individual lead characters are not available for purchase... this newspaper sometimes has to replace individual words and phrases with similar-sounding characters, we hope for the reader's understanding." This is actually evading their own responsibility and prevaricating the reader's supervision. Facts have proved that after this notice was published, the errors in the newspaper did not occur "sometimes" but frequently, and not "individually" but in large numbers. In the 140th issue alone, there were ten errors.
	At that time, Jiaohe Miner's News did lack "individual lead characters," but this difficulty could not only be solved by engraving characters, but also the workers who typeset the newspaper used the method of piecing together characters to solve some missing characters in the labor competition. The editorial department did not study how to improve the problem of missing characters, but used the method of "hoping for the reader's understanding" to shirk responsibility, which was certainly wrong.
	However, the seriousness of the editorial department's mistakes does not lie here, but in the fact that many of the important political errors in the newspaper were not due to the lack of "individual lead characters." Take the errors that occurred in the 140th issue of the newspaper: when the newspaper published the Xinhua News Agency's news and original text of the "Order of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Implementing the Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth," "Order on Implementing the Planned Purchase of Cotton," and "Order on the Conscription of Supplementary Soldiers," it actually mistook "认售" (rèn shòu, to subscribe and sell) for "任售" (rèn shòu, to allow to sell), "评产评售" (píng chǎn píng shòu, to assess production and sales) for "平产平售" (píng chǎn píng shòu, to equalize production and sales), mistook the army service period of "three years" for "two years," and mistook "state capitalism" for "国家资本圭义" (guójiā zīběn guī yì, a nonsensical phrase, literally "state capital gui ism"). When quoting the original text of the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People's Masses Throughout the Party," it mistook "irreconcilable struggle" for "不调合的斗争" (bù tiáo hé de dòuzhēng, unharmonious struggle). These certainly cannot be said to be "unimportant" either. And the characters "三" (sān, three), "和" (hé, and), "主" (zhǔ, master), and "认" (rèn, recognize) could all be found on the same newspaper where the errors occurred; the character "评" (píng, assess) had also appeared on this newspaper many times before. This proves that these errors have nothing to do with the lack of lead characters.
	Facts have proved that the main reason for the above-mentioned political errors in Jiaohe Miner's News is that the work of the newspaper's editorial department is very sloppy; especially because they have a very serious misunderstanding and laissez-faire attitude towards errors in the newspaper. It is understood that in addition to publishing the above notice, the editorial department has not made a public review of the errors, nor has it conducted a deep internal examination, and has not yet stipulated a method to prevent errors, and even the editorial department does not even look at the proof before the newspaper is printed. Such a wrong attitude towards errors, readers can never and should not give "understanding," on the contrary, readers have the right to demand that the Jiaohe Miner's News editorial department make a deep examination and set out practical and effective methods to prevent and eliminate such errors.
	Among factory and mine newspapers, Jiaohe Miner's News is not the only one that frequently has errors in the newspaper, but it is relatively common. It is understood that although all newspapers generally have some objective difficulties, the editorial department's insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the errors in the newspaper is the main reason for their occurrence. Therefore, all factory and mine newspapers should further strictly demand themselves with the principles of the Party's newspapers, and any unserious and sloppy attitude is unacceptable. In particular, the newspaper editorial department should not have any emotions of "hoping for the reader's understanding," but should try to attract the masses to help eliminate errors in the newspaper. This is the correct attitude to be responsible to the people and to the Party.

### 不能“望读者鉴谅”

    不能“望读者鉴谅”
    高西
    好些厂矿报纸编辑部都存在着厂矿小报发生些错误不要紧的看法，他们的理由是“我们的小报发行范围不广，报纸错误的影响不大”。这种说法是极端错误和有害的。厂矿报纸的重大任务之一，就是向工人群众传达党的政策和指示，并要工人群众按照这些政策和指示来行动。在这种情况下报纸的每一个错误将会发生什么样的影响，是不难想像到的。
    这种对待错误的看法，削弱了报纸编辑部对于报纸上错误的斗争，它瓦解着报纸工作人员的政治责任心，因而使一些重大的政治性的错误，夹杂于一般技术性错误之中，大量出现在某些报纸上。在这方面中共蛟河矿务局工作委员会的机关报——蛟河矿工报就是一个比较突出的例子。
    蛟河矿工报经常在报面上出现错字，其中有些是政治性的重大错误。例如该报六十九期的一篇文章里，引用“中国共产党中央委员会关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”时，就将“即令并未征求或并未征得被批评者的同意”一句话中的“征”字错成了“曾”字，这就使人完全不能理解这句话是什么意思了。这当然不能说是“不要紧”的。但是该报并不是认真地检讨和积极设法来纠正这种错误，而是强调客观困难来放任它，甚至在九十期报纸上公开刊登启事说：“兹因……个别铅字购买不到……本报有时个别字句，不得不以类音字代替，望读者鉴谅。”这实际上是规避自己的责任并搪塞读者的监督。事实证明在这个启事刊登以后，报纸上的错误并不是“有时”而是经常，并不是“个别”而是大量地发生。仅一四○期一张报纸上就出现了十处错误。
    当时，蛟河矿工报虽然确实缺少“个别铅字”，但这个困难，不只是可以用刻字的方法来解决，而且排印报纸的工人在劳动竞赛中，就用拼字方法也解决了一些缺字。编辑部不去研究如何改进缺字的问题，而用“望读者鉴谅”的方法来推卸责任，当然是不对的。
    但是，该报编辑部错误的严重性还不在此，而是在于该报很多重要的政治性的错误的发生，并非由于缺少“个别铅字”。就拿一四○期报纸上发生的那些错误来看吧：报纸在刊登新华社播发的“中央人民政府政务院举行政务会议，通过‘关于实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令’、‘关于实行棉花计划收购的命令’和‘关于征集补充兵员的命令’”的消息和命令原文时，竟把“认售”错为“任售”，“评产评售”错为“平产平售”，把陆军服役期“三年”错为“二年”，把“国家资本主义”错为“国家资本圭义”。在引用党中央的“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”原文时，把“不调和的斗争”错为“不调合的斗争”。这些当然也不能说是“不要紧”的。而“三”、“和”，“主”、“认”等字，在那张发生错误的报纸上就都可找到；“评”字也曾先后在这个报纸上出现过多次。这就证明这些错误根本和缺乏铅字无关了。
    事实证明，蛟河矿工报产生上述政治性错误的主要原因，是报纸编辑部的工作十分草率；特别是由于他们对报纸上的错误持有十分严重的错误认识和放任态度。据了解，该报编辑部除了刊登以上启事以外，对错误并未作过公开检讨，也未在内部进行深刻的检查，直到如今尚未规定防止错误的办法，甚至在报纸付印前，编辑部连大样都不看。像这样一种对待错误的错误态度，读者是决不能也不应该给予“鉴谅”的，相反的读者有权利要求蛟河矿工报编辑部作深刻的检查，并定出切实有效的办法来防止和消灭这种错误。
    在厂矿报纸中，经常在报上发生错误的并不只是蛟河矿工报一个，而是比较普遍的。据了解，各报虽都一般地存在着一些客观困难，但编辑部对于报纸上错误的严重性认识不足，是其发生错误的最主要的原因。因此，所有厂矿报纸，就应当更进一步以党的报纸的原则来严格要求自己，任何不严肃和草率从事的态度都是要不得的。特别是报纸编辑部不应抱有任何“望读者鉴谅”的情绪，而应多方设法吸引群众来帮助消灭报纸上的错误。这才是对人民对党负责的正确态度。
