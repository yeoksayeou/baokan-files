Xinhua News Agency, 21st — According to the Associated Press, the United States is exerting pressure on its accomplice countries in the Korean War, urging them to "jointly notify the abolition of the provisions in the Korean Armistice Agreement that prohibit either side from reinforcing or re-equipping its troops in Korea." The U.S. State Department believes that doing so will "legally clear the way" for the United States to take measures to strengthen the position of its troops.

According to an article published in the British "Sunday Times" by its Tokyo correspondent Hughes, the United States is plotting to sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement in order to freely carry out aggressive activities in the Taiwan area. The U.S. Supreme Command in Tokyo has requested the abandonment of the basic provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The reporter said that it is understood that these suggestions are fully approved by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The reporter said that the U.S. plan stipulates: "1. Remove all restrictions on supplying new military equipment (including atomic weapons) to U.S. troops in Korea, and increase the supply of heavy weapons and aircraft to the South Korean Command. 2. Abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission."

    美国策划破坏朝鲜停战协定
    【新华社二十一日讯】据美联社透露，美国正在向它的侵朝帮凶国家行使压力，要它们“联合通知废除朝鲜停战协定中规定禁止双方的任何一方增援或重新装备它在朝鲜的部队的条款”。美国国务院认为，这样做将会“在法律上扫清道路”，使美国能够采取措施来加强它的部队的地位。
    据英国“星期日泰晤士报”刊载它的驻东京记者休斯写的一篇报道美国正在策划破坏朝鲜停战协定的文章说，为了能放手在台湾地区进行侵略活动，东京的美国最高司令部要求废弃朝鲜停战协定基本条款。这个记者说，据悉，这些建议是得到美国参谋长联席会议充分赞成的。
    记者说，美国的计划规定：“一、取消关于供应新军事装备（包括原子武器）给在朝鲜的美国军队的一切限制，并增加对南朝鲜司令部的重武器和飞机的供应。二、撤销中立国监察委员会”。
