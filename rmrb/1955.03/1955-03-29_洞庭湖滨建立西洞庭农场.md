	West Dongting Farm, a state-owned farm, has recently been established on the Dongting Lake plain in Hunan Province. The farm has a total area of approximately 140,000 mu (including inland lakes and swampy areas), with about 80,000 mu of arable land. After the completion of the massive Dongting Lake levee repair project, the area along the lake has gained more than 176,000 mu of cultivated land. The state-owned West Dongting Farm is established on this newly reclaimed land.

	Currently, the farm's site planning is underway, and more than 150 head of draft cattle and a large number of farm implements have been delivered. Eight tractors and over a hundred more head of cattle will soon arrive. More than a thousand farm workers from various regions have been organized into production teams and have begun spring plowing. The farm plans to sow 50,000 mu of rice, cotton, jute, sorghum, and other crops in 1955.

    洞庭湖滨建立西洞庭农场
    湖南省洞庭湖滨平原上最近建成一所国营西洞庭农场。这个农场总面积约十四万亩（包括内湖、沼泽地段），可耕地约有八万亩左右。工程浩大的洞庭湖堤垸整修工程完工后，滨湖地区增加了耕地面积十七万六千多亩。国营西洞庭农场便是建立在这部分耕地上。
    现在农场场地的规划工作正在进行，并已运到一百五十多头耕牛和大批农具。还有八部拖拉机和一百多头耕牛，不日就可运到。从各地来的一千多名农场工人已编成生产队投入春耕。这个农场计划一九五五年播种水稻、棉花、黄麻、高粱等作物五万亩。（新华社）
