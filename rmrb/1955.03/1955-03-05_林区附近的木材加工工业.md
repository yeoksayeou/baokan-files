Timber processing industry near forest areas
In the forest areas such as the Lesser Khingan Mountains in Heilongjiang Province and in cities near the forest areas, there are already 69 state-owned and local state-owned timber mills. Among them is the most modern comprehensive timber processing plant in China, the Harbin Comprehensive Timber Processing Plant. Many of its machines and equipment are manufactured in the Soviet Union and Poland, and it has phenolic board, furniture, lumber, and drying workshops. The production and transportation systems are automated.

These factories process logs into various squares and boards suitable for construction, supplying them to all parts of the country. Currently, 15 provinces and cities across the country and 17 central ministries' basic construction units are obtaining the timber they need from here. Much of the timber for Anshan Iron and Steel, the First Automobile Factory, the Jiji Railway, and the Lanxin Railway has been transported from here.

In the past, the timber industry in Heilongjiang Province was scattered and attached to the forest harvesting departments. Both production and management were backward. It was not until 1953 that independent timber mills were built in a unified manner. In the past few years, the production of state-owned timber mills has increased about fivefold. Due to centralized and unified management, the economic accounting system is also easier to implement. Therefore, in 1954, the profit plan turned over to the state was overfulfilled by more than two times, changing the past situation of serious losses.

Now, based on centralized and unified management, the timber industry in Heilongjiang Province is studying the overall plan and technological transformation of the timber industry. At present, attention has begun to be paid to the problem of waste material utilization. A large amount of red pine and white pine bark is being supplied to paper mills such as Shixian as raw material for pulp. Many bark pieces are processed into canned food boxes, soap boxes, and wine boxes. Many wood chips are made into furniture and toys. Furthermore, many particleboards are being manufactured, and sawdust bricks have been successfully trial-produced. They can be used by basic construction units as walls, ceilings, and roof panels, which are not only cheap and save wood, but also have the advantages of insulation, heat preservation, moisture resistance, and fire prevention.

    林区附近的木材加工工业
    黑龙江省小兴安岭等林区附近和靠近林区的城市中，已有六十九个国营和地方国营制材工厂，其中有我国最现代化的哈尔滨综合木材加工厂，许多机器设备都是苏联和波兰制造的，有胶木板、家具、制材、干燥等车间，生产运输系统都已自动化。
    这些工厂把原木加工成适合建筑用的各种木方和木板，供应全国各地。目前，全国有十五个省市和中央十七个部所属基本建设单位都在这里取得所需的木材，鞍钢和第一汽车厂、集二铁路、兰新铁路的许多木材都是由这里运去的。
    黑龙江省的制材工业过去都是附属在森林采伐部门分散进行的，无论生产和管理工作都较落后，一九五三年后才统一起来建成了独立的制材工厂。几年来国营制材工厂的生产已提高了五倍左右。由于集中统一管理，经济核算制也便于贯彻，因此一九五四年超额二倍多完成了上缴利润计划，改变了过去严重亏蚀的情况。
    现在黑龙江省制材工业在集中统一管理基础上，正在研究制材工业的整体规划和技术改造。目前已开始注意废材利用问题，大量红松和白松的板皮正供应石涀等造纸厂作纸浆原料，许多板皮加工成罐头箱、肥皂箱和酒箱，许多碎木作成了家具和玩具，并正在制造许多刨花板和试制成功了锯末砖，它可供基本建设单位作墙壁、天花板、屋面板用，不仅价格便宜，节约了木材，并具有隔离、保温、防潮、防火等优点。（本报记者哈尔滨讯）
