New and Old Members Closely United
-- The Experience of Four Cooperatives in Shahe Township, Licheng County, in Uniting New and Old Members During Cooperative Expansion
Zheng Song

Shahe Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, has eleven agricultural production cooperatives. Among them, the four best-run cooperatives expanded from 131 households to 284 households before last autumn.

In the work of expanding the cooperatives, the first problem encountered was the ideological concerns and confused ideas of the masses both inside and outside the cooperatives regarding the expansion. Within the cooperatives, although the general cooperative cadres and members initially recognized that running cooperatives was taking the road of agricultural collectivization and had the need for expanded reproduction, they still had many ideological contradictions and concerns. Some were afraid that they would not be able to lead after the cooperative expanded and that the original cooperative would be thrown into chaos. They said: "Expanding the cooperative is good, but how will it be led after it expands?" "The existing ones are enough to lead; if more come in, the cooperative will be thrown into chaos, and even the distribution of farm work will be impossible!" Some were afraid of trouble. An accountant in one cooperative said: "Expanding the cooperative requires setting up separate accounts and reorganizing the teams, which is really troublesome. It would be better to let them organize a new cooperative." Some cooperative members said: "We just finished organizing the teams, and we are all familiar with the work. Now we have to expand, and once we expand, it will be troublesome again." Some were afraid that new cooperative members would take advantage of the old cooperative members. They said: "We have been working for a year and have done so much, and now we are going to let them come in and 'take it easy'?" In addition, some cooperative members took a laissez-faire attitude towards expanding the cooperative, saying: "We don't care whether the cooperative expands or not; the cooperative cadres can expand it if they want to."

Outside the cooperatives, most of those who wanted to join the cooperatives recognized the benefits of cooperatives and consciously wanted to join; however, many also wanted to join for "glory" and to "follow the crowd." They said: "Let's join; everyone else is joining. What will we do if we are the only ones left out?" "Joining early earns glory, joining late lags behind, so why not join early?" Some who had suffered from being "squeezed" during the unified purchase of grain in the spring of 1953 wanted to join the cooperative to avoid being "squeezed." They said: "During the unified purchase and sale, people in the cooperative could weigh the grain and leave some for themselves to eat and then sell it. Outside the cooperative, there were discussions and debates, but in the end, it was always unpleasant. If we join the cooperative, we won't have to suffer those torments!" Some wanted to join the cooperative because they disliked the trouble of running mutual aid teams and wanted to "take it easy" in the cooperative, saying: "Mutual aid teams record work points today and calculate accounts tomorrow, which is a lot of fuss. Joining the cooperative will be easier, and we won't have to worry about it." Some wanted to join the cooperative to get more loans and more material supplies. They said: "The government supports cooperatives. If we join the cooperative, we won't have to worry about loans and supplies."

In order to correct everyone's ideological understanding of expanding the cooperative, on the one hand, we held meetings of cooperative cadres and cooperative members to conduct education on the significance and policies of expanding the cooperative, explaining that the existing cooperatives must lead all farmers to advance together, which is a glorious responsibility, and only in this way can we gradually achieve agricultural collectivization; expanding the cooperative can increase the conditions for expanded reproduction, increase land, labor, livestock, and investment, and further improve production; we also explained that new and old cooperative members should handle the means of production in a spirit of mutual benefit, and no one can infringe on anyone's legitimate interests. On the other hand, we held meetings of mutual aid team leaders and mass meetings who wanted to join the cooperative, conducted education on the benefits of joining the cooperative and the nature and policies of the cooperative, specifically introduced the advantages of the cooperative in various aspects and the various systems of the cooperative; and explained that joining the cooperative must comply with the cooperative's charter and implement the policy of mutual benefit. Then, we conducted full discussions in mutual aid teams and families.

On the basis of ideological education conducted separately inside and outside the cooperative, we held a joint conference of cooperative members and farmers who wanted to join the cooperative, where new and old cooperative members introduced each other's situations, and organized those who wanted to join the cooperative to conduct visits, so that old cooperative members further understood the ideas of those who wanted to join the cooperative, and those who wanted to join the cooperative further understood the nature and various policies and systems of the cooperative. After doing this, the ideological awareness of the masses both inside and outside the cooperative was further improved. Cooperative cadres and members more clearly understood the significance of expanding the cooperative and established a correct attitude towards absorbing new cooperative members; the masses outside the cooperative also clearly understood the purpose of running the cooperative and corrected incorrect motives. Cooperative cadre Jia Mingxun said: "To realize agricultural collectivization and further expand reproduction, is it okay not to expand the cooperative? We can't get to socialist society by ourselves! Our cooperative has already used tractors to cultivate the land, but there is a lot of land in the middle that is separated by the land of non-cooperative members, which is not a complete piece, so it can't be cultivated; if the cooperative expands, the land will be larger, and the tractor can play a greater role." Cooperative member Lu Hongyi used to be afraid that new cooperative members would take advantage of him and did not want to absorb new cooperative members and wanted to not retain public accumulation funds. After education, he said: "I used to think wrong! If I did it according to my idea, the cooperative could not be expanded, how could we get to socialism? How can we increase production more?" Wu Zhenlian, who wanted to join the cooperative, said: "Now I understand: joining the cooperative is more work, more reward, and implementing the policy of mutual benefit, 'taking it easy' is wrong. I guarantee to act in accordance with the cooperative's charter and actively participate in labor after joining the cooperative."

×××

Cooperative cadres and members agreed to absorb new cooperative members. However, many people still did not have a clear understanding of who to absorb into the cooperative. Therefore, there were three deviations: First, they only wanted to absorb middle peasants with good land quality, livestock, farm tools, and labor into the cooperative, and did not want to absorb poor peasants without livestock and farm tools into the cooperative. They said: "We need to be careful not to let those who have no livestock come to our cooperative." Second, they only wanted to absorb activists into the cooperative and did not want to absorb the masses with lower awareness into the cooperative. They said: "Don't let those 'dead backward ghosts' join the cooperative. Let them live outside the cooperative for two or three years and learn a lesson." Third, they did not have a clear understanding of hostile elements and wanted to absorb them into the cooperative simply because they did not see any problems on the surface. Some even wanted to absorb them because they thought these people were "capable" and "good at talking," or were afraid of "offending" them if they did not absorb them into the cooperative.

Outside the cooperative, among those who wanted to join the cooperative, there were also some problems: Some mutual aid teams had some people who agreed to join the cooperative, while others did not agree to join the cooperative; in this way, joining the cooperative would disrupt or dismantle the mutual aid team. A small number of landlords, rich peasants, and politically impure elements took the opportunity to demand to join the cooperative, wanting to infiltrate the cooperative and carry out sabotage, or to use this to raise their political status. According to preliminary understanding, there was one landlord who had escaped the net, one hidden rich peasant (an old rich peasant who was wrongly classified as a middle peasant during the land reform), ten puppet heads of baojia system, fourteen soldiers of fortune, four heads of Taoist sects, and five counter-revolutionary elements under control.

From these situations, the most fundamental problem was that the Party's class policy in the countryside was not well implemented. Therefore, first, class policy education was conducted within the cooperative, explaining that poor and middle peasants must unite closely, and the cooperative should help farmers with economic difficulties to develop production and advance together; the working farmers with low awareness should not be discriminated against, but should be well united and educated; on the other hand, it was emphasized that the cooperative only allows working farmers to participate, and it is necessary to draw a clear line with rich peasants and strictly prevent rich peasants and reactionaries from joining the cooperative to carry out exploitation and sabotage activities. In this way, the ideological awareness of the peasant masses inside and outside the cooperative was improved another step.

After drawing a clear line, the cooperative management committee conducted a serious review and study based on the situation of the mutual aid teams and the situation of each household of farmers who wanted to join the cooperative, and submitted it to the cooperative members' meeting for approval, absorbing the working farmers who wanted to join the cooperative into the cooperative on the basis of mutual aid teams.

In order to fully unite the new and old cooperative members, after absorbing the new cooperative members, a joint celebration meeting of new and old cooperative members was held, further educating on the direction of agricultural collectivization and the policies of the cooperative, as well as the unity of new and old cooperative members, calling on new and old cooperative members to unite and run the cooperative well. New and old cooperative members exchanged ideas and introduced situations, achieving mutual understanding and unity, and laying a good foundation for further solving the specific problems of the means of production of new and old cooperative members.

×××

Although the new and old cooperative members knew that the means of production must be handled in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit, they did not have a clear understanding of what standards to handle the various means of production, and the ideological struggle was still very intense. The old cooperative members were afraid that the new cooperative members would take advantage of them in terms of public livestock and farm tools, while the new cooperative members were afraid that the old cooperative members would make them suffer losses. According to this situation, after once again conducting education on the nature and policies of the cooperative, three principles of handling were passed through democratic discussion: First, it is necessary to proceed from the semi-socialist nature of the cooperative, so that the handling of various means of production is in line with this nature and conducive to the consolidation and development of the cooperative. For example, the land of cooperative members must be largely incorporated into the cooperative for unified cultivation, and various livestock and large farm tools must be returned to the cooperative for unified use. Cooperative members must participate in the labor of the cooperative; dividends must be mainly based on labor, but land must also be appropriately compensated; the cooperative must accumulate public accumulation funds and public welfare funds from less to more, and so on. Second, it is necessary to implement the principle of mutual benefit, which is conducive to the unity of poor and middle peasants. For example, appropriate compensation must be given for livestock and farm tools, and they cannot be returned to the public free of charge; poor and needy peasants must be taken care of and helped, helping them to solve their living difficulties and improve their economic status, and avoid class differentiation. Third, it is necessary to conduct full democratic consultation according to the different situations of each cooperative, so that every cooperative member has no objections in the end. According to this principle, each cooperative first proposed a preliminary plan for the handling of various means of production by the cooperative management committee, and then passed it after full discussion by the cooperative members' meeting.

They decided: The land of the old cooperative members that has already been incorporated into the cooperative will remain unchanged. Among them, some land requires a lot of labor for basic construction and has very little income this year, so some labor work will be moved to the future dividend, so as not to affect the income of the old cooperative members this year. The land of the new cooperative members, except for a small number of vegetable gardens and threshing grounds, will all be incorporated into the cooperative for unified cultivation. The original cooperative members will pay seeds, fertilizers, and set aside a certain amount of funds for sideline production on their own land, and set aside a certain amount of funds for the cooperative's office expenses. They cannot reduce investment and the funds that should be set aside for public needs just because the cooperative has expanded. The new cooperative members must bring their own seeds according to the amount of their land, sell their fertilizers to the cooperative for unified use at a price, and invest in the cooperative's sideline industry or expanded reproduction according to their ability, and bear the cooperative's office expenses after joining the cooperative. In short, we must strive for reasonable burden-sharing between new and old cooperative members, which is conducive to the cooperative's production. In addition, for many specific issues, such as the distance, fertility, whether the land has wells or trees, the price of fertilizer, the valuation of public farm tools, the amount of compensation for private farm tools, the price of livestock, the interest on investment in the cooperative, etc., the new cooperative members all agreed to the provisions of the original cooperative members' charter and were willing to comply with them without any changes.

×××

The expansion of the cooperative made the shortage of leadership backbone a major difficulty in the cooperative. This problem can be completely solved. Each cooperative has a considerable number of activists. As long as they are carefully trained, their work ability and ideological level will be quickly improved. However, the original cooperative cadres have many incorrect ideas about promoting new backbone members, which affects the large-scale and correct selection of new backbone members. They generally have ideas that require too high and too strict conditions for backbone members. They cannot find "perfect" backbone members, and they feel that "ordinary" backbone members are not good. For example, in the "Lifeng" Cooperative, there were four activists among the original cooperative members and three activists among the newly joined cooperative members. However, the cooperative management committee believed that none of them were suitable when studying and selecting cooperative cadres, and they could not find a suitable person after discussing it all night. Xie Cheng, the mutual aid team leader and poor peasant activist who newly joined the Wang Zhaoyou Cooperative, has a high level of awareness, is active in handling affairs, and has a certain leadership ability; just because he is not good at speaking, the original cooperative cadres said that he cannot be a cooperative cadre. They rarely considered the selection of cooperative cadres from the aspects of class background, ideological awareness, practical ability to handle affairs, and work attitude, but only focused on "good at speaking" and "good at writing," and some even simply thought that whoever "can speak" should be made a cooperative cadre; some poor peasant activists are fair and active in handling affairs, but just because they are not good at speaking in front of many people, they are considered not to be able to be cooperative cadres.

According to this situation, each cooperative educated the cadres and members, explaining that the cooperative can only be run well if a large number of backbone members are promoted to enrich the leadership, that the principle of "fair and capable" must be adhered to when promoting cooperative cadres, and that everyone should be guided to accept the experience of selecting cooperative cadres in the past. In this way, everyone's understanding was improved and conservative ideas were broken. Wang Zhaoyou said: "The cooperative has expanded, and the cooperative cannot be run well without promoting more new backbone members. Don't be afraid that they are not good now. As long as they have good ideas and a certain ability, it is okay to promote them and train them. Didn't our cooperative's vice-chairman Ma Maolin and female vice-chairman Jia Mingfen not even dare to speak when they first became chairmen? Jia Mingfen even cried several times! However, they have a high level of awareness, are fair and active in handling affairs, and are willing to learn themselves. Now, not only has their leadership ability improved, but they can also speak and say things. They have also made reports at conferences in the district, county, and province!" After democratic discussion, this cooperative newly elected five production team leaders, seven deputy leaders, and ten production group leaders, and fully enriched the backbone members who were missing after the cooperative expanded.

The selection of new cadres was carried out entirely according to actual needs and the conditions of "fairness and competence," and democracy was fully developed in the selection of cadres, and the new and old cooperative members had no objections.

    新老社员亲密地团结起来了
    ——历城县沙河乡四个社在扩社过程中团结新老社员的经过
    郑松
    山东省历城县沙河乡有十一个农业生产合作社。其中办得最好的四个社在去年秋前由一百三十一户扩大到了二百八十四户。
    在扩社工作中，首先遇到的问题是社内外群众对扩大社有许多思想顾虑和糊涂观念。在社内，一般社干部和社员虽然初步认识了办合作社是走农业集体化的道路，有着扩大再生产的要求，要求把现有社加以扩大，但是思想上也还有不少矛盾，还有不少顾虑。有人怕扩大社后领导不起来和把原有社搞乱了，他们说：“扩大社是好，但扩大了怎么领导？”“现有的这些就够领导的了，如果再进来些，到时候非把社搞乱不行，连分配农活也没有办法啦！”有些人怕麻烦，有一个社的会计说：“扩大社就得另结账、重编队，真麻烦，还不如叫他们组织新社好。”有的社员说：“刚才把队编好了，干活也都熟悉了，现在又要扩大，一扩大又一次麻烦。”有些人怕新社员入社沾了老社员的便宜。他们说：“咱搞了一年，费了这么些事，刚打下个底，就叫他们进来吃‘清闲’吗？”此外，还有些社员对扩大社抱着不管不问的态度，说：“扩大社不扩大社咱不管，社干部说扩大就扩大。”
    在社外，大多数要求入社的人是认识了合作社的好处，自觉要求入社的；也有不少要求入社的人是“图光荣”“随大流”。他们说：“入社就入吧，人家都入，光剩咱不入怎么办？”“早参加赚个光荣，晚参加落个落后，为什么不早参加呢？”有些在一九五三年春粮食统购中受了“挤”的，想入社不受“挤”，他们说：“统购统销时，社里的人过过秤留下吃的卖了就行了，在社外是这样讨论，那样讨论，最后还是个不痛快。入了社，可不受那些罪了！”有的要入社是嫌搞互助组麻烦，入社“图清闲”，说：“互助组今天记工，明天算账，罗罗嗦嗦，入了社清闲清闲，可不用操心了。”也有想入社多得贷款，多得物资供应的，他们说：“政府扶持合作社，入合作社贷款供应什么也不愁了。”
                    ×××
    为了端正大家对扩大社的思想认识，一方面开了社干部会和社员大会，进行了扩大社的意义和政策教育，说明了：现有合作社必须带动全体农民共同前进，这是个光荣责任，只有这样才能逐步做到农业集体化；扩大社能够增加扩大再生产的条件，增加土地、劳力、牲畜、投资，进一步提高生产；也说明了：新老社员是以互利精神处理生产资料，谁也不能侵犯谁的合法利益。另方面召开了要求入社的互助组长会、群众会，进行了入社的好处以及社的性质、政策的教育，具体介绍了合作社在各方面表现出来的优越性和合作社的各项制度；说明了入社必须遵守社章，执行互利政策。然后，又以互助组、家庭为单位充分地进行了讨论。
    在社内外分别进行了思想教育的基础上，又召开了社员和要求入社的农民的联合大会，由新老社员互相介绍了情况，并组织要求入社的人进行参观、访问，使老社员进一步了解了要求入社的人的思想，要求入社的人也进一步了解了合作社的性质和各项政策、制度。这样做了以后，社内外群众的思想觉悟进一步提高了。社干部和社员更明确地认识了扩大社的意义，树立了吸收新社员的正确态度；社外群众也明确认识了办社的目的，纠正了不正确的动机。社干部贾明训说：“要实现农业集体化，要进一步扩大再生产，不扩大社还行吗？光咱自己也不能走到社会主义社会啊！咱社已经用拖拉机耕地了，但是有很多土地中间隔着非社员的土地，不成片，就没法耕；社扩大了，土地片大了，拖拉机才能发挥更大作用。”社员路洪义原来怕新社员沾便宜，不愿吸收新社员，想不留公积金，经过教育以后说：“我以前想的不对啦！按我那个想法做，社扩大不了，怎么能到社会主义？怎么能更多增加生产？”要求入社的吴振连说：“这会儿我明白了：入社是多劳多得，执行互利政策，‘图清闲’是不对的。我入社后保证按社章办事，积极参加劳动。”
                  ×××
    社干部和社员们同意吸收新社员了。但是，很多人对于吸收什么人入社仍然没有明确的认识。因此，发生了三种偏向：一是只愿吸收土地质量好，有牲畜、农具、劳力的中农入社，不愿吸收无牲畜、农具的贫农入社。说：“要长一点眼色，别叫那些没有牲畜的到咱社里来。”二是只愿吸收积极分子入社，不愿吸收觉悟较低的群众入社。说：“那些‘死落后鬼’，可别让他们入社，叫他在社外住上二三年，知道一下滋味再说。”三是对敌对分子认识不清，只从表面看他们没问题，就想吸收他们入社，有的甚至看这些人“有本事”“会说”，就想吸收他们，或者怕不吸收他们入社会“得罪”他们。
    在社外，要求入社的人中间，也还有一些问题：有的互助组一部分人入社，而另一部分人则不同意入社；这样，就会因入社拉乱或者拆散互助组。有少数地主富农和政治不纯分子乘机要求入社，想混入社内进行破坏，或借此提高政治地位。据初步了解，其中就有漏网地主一户，隐蔽的富农（土地改革时错划为中农的老富农）一户，伪保长十个，兵痞十四个，道会门头子四个，被管制的反革命分子五个。
    从这些情况来看，最根本的问题是没有很好地贯彻党在农村的阶级政策。于是，首先在社内进行了阶级政策教育，说明贫农中农必须紧密团结，合作社应该帮助经济上有困难的农民发展生产，共同前进；对觉悟低的劳动农民也不应歧视，而应很好地团结教育；另方面则强调说明合作社只允许劳动农民参加，必须和富农划清界限，严防富农和反动分子入社进行剥削和破坏活动。这样，把社内外农民群众的思想觉悟又提高了一步。
    在划清界限以后，社务委员会便根据互助组的情况和要求入社的各户农民的情况，进行了认真的审查研究，提交社员大会通过，以互助组为基础吸收了要求入社的劳动农民入社。
    为了使新老社员充分团结，在吸收新社员之后，便召开了新老社员联欢大会，进一步进行了农业集体化方向和合作社政策以及新老社员团结的教育，号召新老社员团结一致，办好合作社。新老社员互相交谈了思想，介绍了情况，达到了互相了解，团结一致，为进一步解决新老社员的生产资料等项具体问题打好了基础。
                  ×××
    虽说新老社员都知道了必须按互利原则处理生产资料，但是对于各项生产资料到底按什么标准处理没有确切的了解，思想斗争仍很激烈。老社员怕在公有牲畜、农具等方面新社员沾便宜，新社员则怕老社员叫自己吃亏。根据这种情况，在再一次进行了社的性质和政策的教育以后，经过民主讨论通过了三项处理原则：第一、必须从合作社的半社会主义性质出发，使各种生产资料的处理符合这一性质，有利于社的巩固发展。例如，社员的土地必须大部入社统一耕种，各种牲畜大农具必须归社统一使用。社员必须参加社的劳动；分红必须以劳动为主，但土地也要得到适当的报酬；社内必须由少到多积累公积金、公益金，等等。第二、必须贯彻互利原则，有利于贫农中农的团结。例如，对牲畜农具等必须给予适当的报酬，不能无偿归公；对穷困贫农必须予以照顾和帮助，帮助他们解决生活困难，提高经济地位，避免阶级分化。第三、必须根据各个社的不同情况，进行充分的民主协商，使得每个社员最后都没有反对意见。根据这个原则，各个社首先由社务委员会将各项生产资料的处理提出初步方案，交社员大会充分讨论以后通过。
    他们决定：老社员的土地已入社的不变，其中个别土地由于进行基本建设用工很多本年收入又很少的，将一部分劳动工挪到以后分红，不使影响老社员这一年的收入。新社员的土地除留下少数菜园、场园外，全部入社统一耕种。原有社员在自己的土地上付出种子、肥料和在副业生产上留出一定数量的资金，留出一定数量的社内办公费用，不能因为社扩大了就减少投资和公共需要应留的款。新社员必须按照自己土地的多少自带种子，把自己的肥料按价卖给社内统一使用，并根据能力向社内副业或扩大再生产方面投资，负担入社后社内的办公费用。总之，要力求新社员老社员合理负担，有利于社的生产。此外，许多具体问题，例如，土地远近、肥瘦、土地带井带树、肥料价格、公有农具的作价、私有农具的报酬量、牲畜价格、向社投资的利息等等，新社员都同意了原老社员所订社章的规定并愿照办，不予变动。
                ×××
    社扩大了，领导骨干不足的问题成了社里的一个主要困难。这个问题是完全可以解决的，各个社都有相当数量的积极分子，只要认真加以培养，是会很快地提高工作能力和思想水平的。但是，原有的社干部对于提拔新的骨干分子有许多不正确的思想，影响着大量地正确地选拔新的骨干。他们普遍地有对骨干条件要求过高过严的思想。“十全十美”的骨干找不着，“一般”的骨干又觉得不好。例如
  “利丰”社，原社员中有积极分子四人，新入社的社员中也有积极分子三人。但社务委员在研究选拔社干部时，却认为一个也不行，讨论了一夜没找着个合适的人。王朝佑社新入社的互助组长、贫农积极分子谢成，觉悟较高，办事积极，并有一定领导能力；只因为他不好说话，原有社干部就说他不能当社干部。他们对于选拔社干部很少从阶级成份、思想觉悟、实际办事能力和工作态度去考虑，只偏重于“会说”“会写”等方面，有的甚至单纯认为谁“会说”就叫谁当社干部；有些贫农积极分子办事公道积极，只因为还不善于在人多的场合下说话，就被认为不能当社干部。
     根据这种情况，各个社对干部和社员进行了教育，说明只有提拔大量骨干充实领导才会把社办好，提拔社干部必须坚持“公道能干”的原则，并且引导大家接受过去选拔社干部的经验。这样，便提高了大家的认识，打破了保守思想。王朝佑说：“社扩大了，不多提拔新骨干社就办不好。不要怕他们现在不行，只要思想好，有一定能力，提拔起来锻炼一下就行了。咱社副社长马茂林和女副社长贾明芬，才当社长时不也是连话也不敢说吗？贾明芬还吓哭了好几场呢！但是，他们觉悟高，办事公道积极，自己又肯学习，现在不但领导能力提高了，而且也能说能道了，还到区、县、省的大会上作过报告哩！”这个社经过民主讨论后，便新选举了生产队长五人、副队长七人、生产组长十人，把社扩大后缺少的骨干全部充实起来了。
    新干部的选拔完全是按实际需要和“公道、能干”的条件进行的，在选拔干部中间充分发扬了民主，新老社员都没有意见。
