    Don't Let Grain Spill From Railcars
    To the Editor:
    When transporting large quantities of grain, various localities use covered wagons and open wagons to load grain in bulk. Some places do not pay attention to checking the condition of the vehicles before loading, and the car doors are not tightly closed after loading. During railway operation, due to the ups and downs and vibrations of the vehicles, grain flows out from the gaps between the car doors and the car body.
    The Taolaizhao Station on the Changbin Line in Northeast China does not load grain, but the staff can often pick up soybeans to eat at the station. For example, when a certain worker wants to roast soybeans to eat during his spare time from work, he can pick up a pocketful outside. If this were the case on tens of thousands of kilometers of railways across the country, the loss of grain would be incalculable.
    It is suggested that grain departments in various localities should quickly correct the phenomenon of grain loss during transportation when loading and transporting bulk grain.

    To the Editor:
    Walking along the railway line near Changtu, you can see soybeans, sorghum, corn and other food grains scattered all over the ground, like farmers sowing seeds. On December 14, 1954, when I passed through the Changtu Station crossing, I saw sorghum flowing out of a train. I walked another half kilometer north and saw soybeans, sorghum, and corn scattered all over the ground. If this were the case from Jiamusi to Dalian, I don't know how much grain would be lost. At a time when farmers across the country are actively responding to the call of the state and enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state, it is intolerable whether the grain department causes leaky vehicles when dispatching them, or whether grain leakage occurs during transportation. It is recommended that comrades in charge of consignment in the grain departments and transportation personnel in charge of transportation do a good job of checking the car body and plugging the gaps before loading to prevent and eliminate grain leakage.

### 不要让车皮撒漏粮食

    不要让车皮撒漏粮食编辑同志：
    在调运大批粮食时，各地都利用盖车、敞车散装粮食。有的地方在装车前对车辆状况不注意进行检查，装车后车门关的不严密，在铁路上运行时由于车辆的起伏和振动，粮食就从车门同车身之间的缝隙里流出去。
    东北长滨线陶赖昭车站并不装粮食，但是职工们经常可以到站上拾到大豆吃，如某工友在工作闲暇时想烤大豆吃，到外面捡起来就是一兜。如全国各地数万公里的铁道上，都像这样的话，粮食的损失是无法计算的。
    建议各地粮食部门在装运散装粮食时，应速纠正运转中粮食散失的现象。东北长滨线陶赖昭车站
                  王充满编辑同志：
    行走在昌图附近的铁路沿线，就可以看见像农民播种似地散失了满地的大豆、高粱、玉茭等食粮。我在一九五四年十二月十四日由昌图车站道口经过，看到一辆列车上流出高粱，我又往北走了一华里，看到大豆、高粱、玉茭洒了满地，如果从佳木斯到大连都是这样，那就不知道要漏多少粮食。当全国各地农民都积极响应国家的号召，把余粮踊跃卖给国家的时候，不管粮食部门发车时造成漏车现象，或运输部门中途发生漏粮情况都是令人不能容忍的。建议各地粮食部门负责托运的同志和运输负责人员，在装车前要做好车体检查和堵塞缝隙的工作，防止和杜绝漏粮现象发生。
