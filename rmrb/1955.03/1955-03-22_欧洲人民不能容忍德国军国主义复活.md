The movement to strive for a nationwide referendum is further unfolding in Germany
After the majority of reactionary members of the West German Bundestag and Bundesrat approved the Paris Agreements, the movement to strive for a nationwide referendum is unfolding more vigorously in Germany.
According to a report by the German News Agency, trade union members, Christian Democratic Union workers, non-partisan workers, members of the German Social Democratic Party and the German Communist Party held a meeting in Bochum on the 18th. The "Committee for a United Germany" was established at the meeting. The purpose of the committee is to hold a national referendum. Among the members of the committee are two representatives of the German Democratic Republic.
The meeting issued a communique stating: After the majority of reactionary members of the Bundestag and Bundesrat approved the Paris Agreements, the people of West Germany are in a dangerous situation. The people do not recognize this undemocratic decision. They will use various methods and extra-parliamentary struggles to prevent the implementation of the Paris Agreements and to achieve the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany.

German Youth Congress Calls on German Youth to Fight Against the Paris Agreements
The German Youth Congress held in Berlin closed on the 20th. Approximately two thousand five hundred German youth representatives participated in the closing meeting held at the Friedrichstadt-Palast, of which more than one thousand seven hundred representatives were youths from West Germany.
During the discussion on the question of German youth participating in the struggle against the remilitarization of Germany, many representatives of youth organizations from East and West Germany spoke.
Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic spoke at the congress. Grotewohl condemned the Bonn Bundestag for violating the true will of the German people by voting in favor of approving the Paris military agreements. He said that we hope to eliminate all obstacles that exist in negotiations to reach a peaceful and unified Germany. No one can deprive us of the right to a unified country. We welcome and support the Soviet Union's proposals for achieving a peaceful and unified Germany. Grotewohl pointed out: The future of Germany should be a peaceful future, but it can only obtain a peaceful future if Germany cooperates peacefully with all countries in Europe. Therefore, we support the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system.
Grotewohl called on the youth to actively fight for the peaceful reunification of Germany. He believed that this congress would help strengthen mutual understanding among all German youth and strengthen the common struggle against the revival of German militarist policies.
At the end of the speech, the participants of the congress passed the German Youth Declaration. The declaration called on West German youth to do everything in their power to fight against the Paris military agreements and strive for a nationwide referendum. The declaration emphasized that in order to oppose the policy of reviving German militarism, strive for German unification, and the happy future of the German people, all German youth must conduct the struggle together.

Paris Women Hold a Rally Demanding That the French Senate Reject the Paris Agreements
Under the auspices of the French Women's Union, a rally was held in Paris on the 19th. The central content of the rally was: to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany, to strive for disarmament, and to strive for peace. Republic Senator Yvonne Dumont, progressive journalist André Marty, Vice-Chairman of the French Women's Union Jeanne Monchous, and a representative of West German working women spoke at the meeting. They emphasized that arming Bonn revanchists would pose a serious threat to the peace of Europe and the entire world.
At the end of the rally, Eugénie Cotton, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, called on French women to unite in the struggle for peace and disarmament, and for a peaceful solution to the German question.
The rally sent a delegation to visit Monnerville, Speaker of the Republic Senate, to represent the women of Paris in demanding that the Republic Senate reject the Paris Agreements in the upcoming debate. (Xinhua News Agency)

    欧洲人民不能容忍德国军国主义复活
    争取举行全德人民投票的运动在德国进一步展开
    在西德联邦议院和参议院的多数反动议员批准巴黎协定以后，争取举行全德人民投票的运动在德国更加有力地开展起来了。
    据德意志通讯社报道，西德工会会员、基督教民主联盟工人、无党派工人、德国社会民主党和德国共产党党员十八日在波鸿举行会议。会上成立了“统一的德国”委员会。委员会的目的是举行全民投票。在委员会的成员中有两位德意志民主共和国的代表。
    会议发表公报说：在联邦议院和参议院的多数反动议员批准巴黎协定以后，西德人民处于危险的境况。人民是不承认这一不民主的决定的。他们将用各种方法和通过议会以外的斗争来阻止巴黎协定的实现，并且使德国获得和平民主的统一。德国青年大会号召全德青年为反对巴黎协定而斗争
    在柏林举行的德国青年大会二十日闭幕。约有两千五百德国青年代表参加了在腓特烈宫剧院举行的闭幕会议，其中有一千七百多代表是西德的青年。
    在讨论关于德国青年参加反对德国重新军国主义化的斗争的问题时，发言的有东西德青年组织的许多代表。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在大会上讲了话。格罗提渥谴责波恩联邦议院违背德国人民真正的意志，投票赞成批准巴黎军事协定。他说，我们希望消除在达成和平统一德国的谈判方面所存在的一切障碍。任何人也不能剥夺我们统一国家的权利。我们欢迎并且支持苏联为了达成和平统一德国所提出的建议。格罗提渥指出：德国的前途应该是和平的前途，但是只有在德国同欧洲所有国家和平合作的情况下，它才有可能获得和平的前途。因此，我们拥护苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。
    格罗提渥号召青年们积极为和平统一德国而斗争。他相信这个大会将有助于加强全体德国青年之间的互相谅解，加强反对复活德国军国主义政策的共同斗争。
    在讲话结束时，大会的参加者通过了德国青年宣言。宣言号召西德青年们竭尽一切力量，为反对巴黎军事协定和争取举行全德人民投票而斗争。宣言着重指出，为了反对复活德国军国主义的政策、争取德国统一和德国人民幸福的前途，全体德国青年必须共同进行斗争。巴黎妇女举行集会要求法国参议院拒绝巴黎协定
    在法兰西妇女联盟主持下，巴黎在十九日举行了一次集会。集会的中心内容是：反对西德重新军国主义化，争取裁减军备，争取和平。共和国参议院议员伊冯娜·杜蒙、进步记者安德烈·马尔蒂·加普格拉、法兰西妇女联盟副主席让娜·蒙绍斯以及西德劳动妇女的一个代表，都在会上讲了话。她们着重指出：武装波恩复仇主义者会对欧洲和整个世界的和平造成严重的威胁。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席欧仁妮·戈登在集会结束时号召法国妇女在争取和平和裁减军备、争取和平解决德国问题的斗争中团结起来。
    集会选派一个代表团去访问共和国参议院议长蒙纳维，代表巴黎妇女要求共和国参议院在快要举行的辩论中拒绝巴黎协定。（据新华社讯）
