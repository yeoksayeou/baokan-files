    Agricultural Machine Station Being Built on the Loess Plateau in Eastern Gansu
    On the boundless Dongzhi tableland in eastern Gansu, an agricultural machine station is beginning construction.
    The preparatory committee and office leading the station's construction were established on March 11th. Soon, they will begin to improve the internal organization, build temporary work sheds, determine a permanent site, survey and measure the area for mechanized farming, and sign mechanized farming contracts. Currently, some tractor drivers and repair personnel have arrived, and tractors and other equipment are already en route. This agricultural machine station is expected to be officially completed in late May, and after test runs, tractors can participate in summer plowing on the plateau in June.
    This agricultural machine station will have four tractors, three seed drills, three cultivators, two five-bottom plows, and two two-bottom plows this year. These machines can cultivate 8,000 mu of land. From next year, the number of tractors and other machinery will continue to increase, and the cultivated area will continue to expand.

    陇东高原上筹建农业机器站
    在甘肃东部一望无际的董志塬上，一个农业机器站正在开始筹建。
    领导建站工作的筹备委员会和办公室，已经于三月十一日成立。很快就要开始健全内部机构，修建临时工棚，确定永久场址，勘查和测量代耕区域，签订代耕合同。现在，部分拖拉机手及修理人员已经到达，拖拉机和其他装备也已在启运途中。这个农业机器站预计在五月下旬正式建成，经过试车以后，六月间，拖拉机就可以参加高原上的夏季伏耕。
    这一农业机器站，今年将拥有四台拖拉机和三部播种机、三部中耕机、两部五铧犁和两部两铧犁等，这些机器能够代耕八千亩土地；从明年起，拖拉机和其他机械装备将会不断增加，代耕面积也将随着不断扩大。
