    Guangdong Silkworm Raising Season Has Arrived

    In Guangdong, mulberry trees have sprouted tender buds everywhere, and the silkworm raising season has arrived.

    Due to Guangdong's warm climate, silkworms can be raised seven or eight times a year. The first brood in 1955 mainly involves promoting white cocoon silkworm breeds. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture specially ordered 34,000 sheets of white cocoon silkworm eggs from East China. The first batch of 25,000 sheets of white cocoon silkworm eggs have already been distributed to silkworm farmers for raising. By mid-April, the first batch of white silkworm cocoons this year will be available on the market.

    In 1955, the total output of silkworm cocoons in Guangdong is required to increase by 25,000 dan compared to 1954, the unit area yield of mulberry fields is required to increase by 15.7 percent, and the mulberry field area is to be expanded by 10,000 mu. In order to achieve this requirement, mulberry farmers in the main silkworm-producing counties, such as Shunde, Nanhai, and Zhongshan, have been seizing the winter period to loosen the soil and apply mud to the mulberry fields. In Shunde County, an average of more than 1,000 dan of mud was applied per mu of more than 70,000 mu of mulberry fields, and seedling inspection and replanting were carried out. In the 14 agricultural production cooperatives in the seventh district alone, 1.73 million mulberry seedlings were replanted in 908 mu of mulberry fields.

    广东育蚕季节已经来临
    广东各地桑树都抽出了嫩芽，育蚕的季节已经来临。
    广东省由于气候温暖，一年可以养蚕七、八造。一九五五年第一造主要是推广白茧蚕种。广东省农业厅特地从华东定购白茧蚕种三万四千张，现在第一批白茧蚕种二万五千张已发给蚕农养育。到四月中旬，今年第一批白蚕茧便可上市。
    一九五五年广东蚕茧的总产量要求比一九五四年增加二万五千担，桑地的单位面积产量要求增产百分之十五点七，并扩大桑地面积一万亩。为了达到这个要求，蚕桑生产的主要县份如顺德、南海、中山等县的桑农都抓紧了冬期桑地松土上泥工作。顺德县七万多亩桑地平均每亩上泥一千担以上，并进行了查苗补苗工作，单七区十四个农业生产合作社的九百零八亩桑地，就补植桑苗一百七十三万株。
