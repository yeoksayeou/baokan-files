State-run farms in southern Xinjiang province have begun plowing and sowing around March 15th; state-run farms in the north are currently intensifying preparations for sowing. This year, Xinjiang province has a total of thirty-three state-run farms, an increase of ten compared to 1954. The spring plowing preparations for each farm have been relatively thorough. Seventeen farms in Turpan, Yili, Kashgar, Korla, and other places had accumulated more than 14 million jin of manure fertilizer by the end of February, with an average of more than 1,420 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu on more than 15,100 mu of land. In addition, each farm has prepared a large amount of niter soil, animal bone fertilizer, oilseed residue and other fertilizers, and added new farm implements such as zigzag harrows, row planters, cultivators and double-wheeled single-furrow plows. The larger Tacheng mechanized farm has also prepared sufficient fuel for tractors. The seeds of each farm have generally been screened and selected, and some have also been treated with "Ceresan".

The planned yield per unit area of grain and cotton for each original farm in 1955 is to be increased by 7 to 10 percent or more compared to 1954. Each farm will also vigorously assist local agricultural production cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams of farmers of all ethnic groups in carrying out technical reforms.

    新疆省南部各地方国营农场开始播种
    新疆南部各地方国营农场，已在三月十五日前后开犁播种；北部各农场现正加紧进行播种前的准备工作。今年，新疆全省已有三十三个地方国营农场，比一九五四年增加了十个。各农场的春耕准备工作都比较充分。吐鲁番、伊犁、喀什、库尔勒等地十七个农场，二月底以前就积粪肥一千四百多万斤，在一万五千一百多亩土地上，平均每亩可施基肥一千四百二十多斤。此外，各农场还准备了大量的硝土、动物骨肥、油渣等肥料，增置了之字耙、条播机、中耕器和双轮单铧犁等新式农具。规模较大的塔城机耕农场并给拖拉机准备了足够的油料。各农场的籽种一般都经过了筛选和粒选，有的还用“赛力散”拌了种。
    各原有农场一九五五年的粮食和棉花的单位面积产量，计划比一九五四年提高百分之七到百分之十以上。各农场还要大力帮助当地农业生产合作社、常年互助组的各族农民进行技术改革。
