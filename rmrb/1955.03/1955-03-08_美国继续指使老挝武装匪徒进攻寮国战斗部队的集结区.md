Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 7th: It was previously reported that armed bandits, instigated by U.S. imperialists and equipped by them with mortars and machine guns, attacked the Lao fighting forces stationed in Muong Boun (formerly translated as Muang Bang) southwest of Sam Neua City, throughout the day and night of March 1st. It is reported that these armed bandits have already occupied Muong Boun and launched an attack on Sala, a few kilometers away from Muong Boun, on March 3rd.

This is a serious act of undermining the Lao ceasefire agreement. At a time when the Lao political conference is at a standstill and Dulles is attempting to drag Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization bloc, the aforementioned attack on Muong Boun in the assembly area of the Lao fighting forces further complicates the situation in Laos. This irrefutably proves that this act is part of the overall plan of U.S. imperialists and their followers to turn Laos into a U.S. war base and gradually encroach upon the two assembly provinces of the Lao fighting forces.

    美国继续指使老挝武装匪徒进攻寮国战斗部队的集结区
   【新华社七日讯】据越南通讯社河内六日讯：前已报道，受美帝国主义者指使并且由它用迫击炮和机关枪装备起来的武装匪徒，在三月一日整日整夜地进攻驻扎在桑怒城西南芒奔（前译芒磅）地方的寮国战斗部队。据悉，这些武装匪徒已经占领了芒奔，在三月三日又向离芒奔几公里的萨拉发动进攻。
    这是严重破坏老挝停战协定的行为。在老挝政治会议陷于停顿而杜勒斯正在企图把老挝拉入侵略性的东南亚条约组织集团的时候，上述的对寮国战斗部队集结区内的芒奔的进攻使老挝的局势更加复杂化。这无可争辩地证明，这一行为是美帝国主义者和它的追随者企图把老挝变为美国战争基地而逐渐侵吞寮国战斗部队的两个集结省份这一总计划中的一部分。
