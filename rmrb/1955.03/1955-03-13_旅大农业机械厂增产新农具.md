Lüda Agricultural Machinery Factory Increases Production of New Farm Implements

Over the past year, the Lüda Agricultural Machinery Factory has produced a large number of new-style animal-drawn farm implements such as medium-sized cultivator-harrowers and double-wheeled double-furrow plows to support agricultural production.

At the end of January this year, the factory overfulfilled its production target of more than 6,700 medium-sized cultivator-harrowers for Inner Mongolia, Xi'an, Anshan, and Shenyang by fifty days ahead of schedule; and strived to deliver the farm implements to farmers before the spring plowing season. These new-style farm implements are not only of good quality and low price, but also light, durable, and have a working efficiency one to two times higher than that of old-fashioned farm implements.

Over the past year, the factory's employees have developed 73 sets of dies and fixtures, gradually improving the quality of various new-style farm implements. Now the parts of the farm implements are interchangeable, and the phenomena of "three-point lines" being misaligned and screws loosening have been basically eliminated. The employees have also put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals, which have greatly shortened the production time of each farm implement and significantly reduced product costs. For example, the ex-factory price of a medium-sized cultivator-harrower in 1953 was 71.4 yuan (new currency), which was reduced to 64.2 yuan in 1954, and the plan for this year is to strive to reduce it to 55.2 yuan.

This year, the factory's production plan has been greatly increased compared to 1954, and the total production of new-style farm implements will exceed 20,000 units. These farm implements will be supplied to farmers in Liaoning and Inner Mongolia and other places.

    旅大农业机械厂增产新农具
    旅大农业机械厂一年来造出大量中型铲趟机、双轮双铧犁等新式畜力农具，支援了农业生产。
    今年一月底，这个工厂提前五十天超额完成了为内蒙、西安、鞍山、沈阳等地制造的六千七百多台中型铲趟机的生产任务；并争取在春耕前把农具送到农民手里。这些新式农具不仅质量好、价格低，而且轻便耐用，工作效率比旧式农具高一倍到两倍。
    全厂职工近一年来，研究出七十三件胎具，使各种新式农具的质量逐渐提高，现在农具部件已经可以互换，基本上消灭了“三点线”不正和螺丝松扣等现象。职工们还提出一百多件合理化建议，使每台农具的生产时间大大缩短，产品成本也显著降低。如中型铲趟机一九五三年的出厂价是七十一元四角（新币），一九五四年降低为六十四元二角，今年计划争取降低到五十五元二角。
    今年，这个厂的生产计划比一九五四年大大提高，新式农具的生产总量要超过两万台。这些农具制成后将陆续供给辽宁和内蒙等地农民使用。
