The Zoological Research Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences dispatched animal scientists to the Changbai Mountain area of Northeast China on March 7th and 15th respectively, to conduct mammal survey and research work.

In order to understand the types of mammals in Northeast China, their living habits and distribution, so as to further protect beneficial mammals and prevent and eliminate harmful mammals, the Zoological Research Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had successively sent working groups to the Greater Khingan and Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeast China in 1953 and 1954 to conduct field surveys and research. They collected a large number of mammal specimens and helped local hunters summarize their folk hunting experience. This year, the plan is to mainly work in the Changbai Mountain area. In addition to observing and collecting specimens in various forest areas, a systematic survey and research on the mammals in this area will be carried out. At the same time, research will be conducted on the prevention and control of rodent damage to *Pinus koraiensis*, the most important tree species in the Changbai Mountain area and Lesser Khingan Mountains, during direct seeding. The systematic survey and research on Northeast mammals conducted by the Zoological Research Laboratory is a work that Chinese scientists have never carried out before. In the past, only some foreign scientists conducted mammal surveys and research in Northeast China, and their work was only fragmented or sporadic.

    中国科学院派出科学工作者进行兽类调查研究工作
    中国科学院动物研究室，在三月七日和十五日分别派出了动物科学工作者，到东北长白山区进行兽类调查研究工作。
    为了了解我国东北地区兽类的种类，它们的生活习惯和分布情况，以便进一步对有益的兽类加以保护，对有害的兽类予以防除，中国科学院动物研究室在一九五三年和一九五四年已先后派工作组到东北大兴安岭和小兴安岭一带进行了野外调查研究工作。他们搜集了不少的兽类标本，并帮助当地猎户总结了民间狩猎的经验。今年计划主要是在长白山区进行工作，除到各森林地区观察、搜集标本外，将对这个地区的兽类作系统的调查研究工作。同时对为害长白山区和小兴安岭最重要的树种红松在直播中的鼠害问题，进行防除研究工作。动物研究室所进行的这一项东北兽类的系统调查研究工作，是过去我国科学工作者从未进行过的工作，过去只有一些外国科学工作者，在我国东北进行过兽类调查研究工作，而且他们的工作也只是片段的或零星的。
