Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: News from Vientiane further exposes that US Secretary of State Dulles’ recent conspiracy activities in Laos aim to undermine the Geneva Accords and sabotage the peaceful unification of Laos.

Following the meeting between Lao Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith and Dulles, it was announced on February 28th that the United States and Laos had decided to begin negotiations on a treaty for the United States to provide military and economic assistance to Laos. This announcement provoked unfavorable reactions from public opinion. On March 2nd, Katay Don Sasorith again issued a statement regarding his meeting with Dulles, saying that Laos did not intend to conclude a military and economic assistance treaty with the United States. Nevertheless, Katay Don Sasorith admitted that Laos was "seeking to ascertain the conditions for the US aid plan to Laos." He openly stated that the Lao government wanted to reach an agreement with the US government on the amount of the planned assistance and acknowledged that, up to now, the monthly increasing US "aid" has been used to maintain the Lao army and purchase military equipment.

As previously reported, the United States not only attempts to control Laos through this military "aid" but has also agreed with Laos to transport Lao troops to Thailand for training, in order to turn them into tools for the United States to sabotage the peaceful unification of Laos. On March 1st, just forty-eight hours after Dulles left Vientiane, Lao Defense Minister Souvannarath Phouma issued a communique stating that Lao officers would soon go to Thailand to receive extensive training based on American military methods. He said that it had been agreed with Thailand that Lao officers would enter Thai training camps to learn modern warfare techniques. The training camps in Thailand have always been controlled and directed by American officers.

Even the French cannot deny that this American behavior completely violates the Geneva Accords. According to Agence France-Presse reports, the French in Saigon believe that the "consequences will be far-reaching" of the United States sending Lao troops to Thailand for training, and that Laos "will be incorporated into" the Manila Treaty military bloc, which "is difficult to reconcile with the Geneva Accords."

    美国进一步破坏老挝和平
    【新华社河内三日电】万象消息进一步暴露了美国国务卿杜勒斯最近访问老挝时所进行的阴谋活动是要破坏日内瓦协定和破坏老挝和平统一。
    老挝首相克特和杜勒斯会谈后在二月二十八日就已经宣布，美国和老挝决定开始谈判缔结美国向老挝提供军事和经济援助的条约。这个谈话引起了舆论的不利的反应。三月二日，克特又就他和杜勒斯的会谈发表谈话说：老挝并没有打算同美国订立一个军事和经济援助条约。虽然如此，克特还是承认，老挝“正在设法探悉美国援助老挝计划的条件”。他公开表示：老挝政府想同美国政府就计划中的援助数目问题达成协议，并且承认，到现在为止，月月增加的美国“援助”都是用来维持老挝军队和购买军事装备的。
    前已报道，美国不仅企图通过这种军事“援助”来控制老挝，并且已经同老挝商定要把老挝军队运送到泰国去训练，以便把它变为美国破坏老挝和平统一的工具。三月一日，即杜勒斯离开万象不过四十八小时以后，老挝国防大臣梭发那·富马发表公报说，老挝军官不久将到泰国去接受根据美国军事方法进行的广泛的训练。他说，已和泰国商定，老挝军官将入泰国的训练营学习现代化战争技术。而泰国的训练营向来是由美国军官控制和主持的。
    美国的这种行为完全违背日内瓦协定的事实，连法国人都无法否认。据法国新闻社报道，西贡的法国人认为，美国把老挝军队送到泰国去加以训练的“后果将是深远的”，老挝“将会被并入”马尼拉条约军事集团，而“这是同日内瓦协定很难协调的”。
