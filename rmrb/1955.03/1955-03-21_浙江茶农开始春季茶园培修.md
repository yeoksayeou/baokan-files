    Zhejiang Tea Farmers Begin Spring Tea Garden Cultivation
    Tea-producing areas in seventy-three counties in Zhejiang Province have mostly begun spring production. Zhejiang Province is a major tea-producing area in China, producing six types of tea: the famous Longjing, Hongqing, Dafang, Black Tea, Chang Tea, and Yuan Tea. Its annual output accounts for about a quarter of the total national output. In 1955, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee allocated 30 million *shi* of chemical fertilizer to improve tea production, which was transported to tea areas in eight counties, including Shaoxing, Yuyao, Zhuji, Yuhang, and Yongjia, for spring fertilization. Tea farmers in various counties are now actively engaged in fertilization, soil cultivation, and pruning of dead branches. In the northern mountainous area of Sheng County, 89 tea mutual aid teams and 2 tea production cooperatives in Jukeng Township have all formulated spring plowing production plans and have generally carried out topdressing. On March 6, the Ma Youjin, Xu Cailin, and Ma Zaiqing mutual aid teams in Maxi Village of the township applied more than 18,300 *jin* of fertilizer in one day. On International Women's Day, women in Maxi and Hengshan villages, in commemoration of their holiday, completed pest control, weeding, and pruning of dead branches in the tea fields of the two villages in one day. The newly established tea production cooperative in Liangxi Township, Shaoxing County, had 39 female members who caught tea pests three times in 40 *mu* of tea fields. The entire cooperative guaranteed a 20% increase in production in 1955 and formulated a plan to continuously catch tea pests, weed, loosen soil, and fertilize to ensure increased production.

    浙江茶农开始春季茶园培修
    浙江省七十三个县的产茶区，大部分开始春季生产。浙江省是我国主要产茶区，出产著名的龙井、烘青、大方、红茶、长茶、元茶等六种茶，年产量约占全国总产量四分之一。一九五五年浙江省人民委员会为提高茶叶产量，已拨出三千万石化学肥料，运往绍兴、余姚、诸暨、余杭、永嘉等八县茶区进行春季施肥。各县茶农现在正积极投入施肥、培土、修剪枯枝等工作。嵊县北山区举坑乡八十九个茶叶互助组、两个茶叶生产合作社都订了春耕生产计划，普遍进行了追肥。三月六日，该乡马溪村马又金、徐财林、马再请三个互助组一天追施肥料一万八千三百多斤，“三八”妇女节那天，马溪、横山两村妇女为了纪念自己的节日，一天内完成两村茶地除虫、拔草、修剪枯枝工作。绍兴县两溪乡新建茶叶生产合作社三十九个女社员，在四十亩茶地里捉了三次茶虫，全社保证一九五五年增产二成，并订出不断捉茶虫、锄草、松土、施肥的计划，以保证增产。　（本报驻杭州记者）
