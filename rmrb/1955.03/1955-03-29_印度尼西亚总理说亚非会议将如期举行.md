    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 28th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo told reporters on the 27th that rumors about the postponement of the Asian-African Conference were unfounded and that the conference would be held as originally scheduled.
    According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Minister of Information, Dubin, told reporters upon his arrival in Medan on the 26th that from a technical standpoint, 80 to 90 percent of the preparations for the Asian-African Conference had been completed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 27th: The Indonesian "Alert Newspaper" commented on the upcoming Asian-African Conference, saying, "At the Bandung Conference, colored people will, for the first time in history, decide their fate without the participation of Western countries. The Asian-African Conference will show all colonial peoples that they are no longer milch cows and that they can become masters in their own homes." The commentary pointed out that Western countries should firmly remember this aspiration of the Asian and African people.
    The "Indonesian Observer" published an editorial on the 26th, stating, "In Asia and North Africa, colonialism has not been buried. West Irian, Goa, Malaya, Tunisia, and Morocco are examples where colonial forces are still haunting today. The continued maintenance of colonial rule in these regions is a blatant violation of the right to self-determination and human rights." The editorial said, "It is a tragic irony that until now, millions of people still suffer from the enslavement of colonial countries, and the only fundamentally untenable reason is for Western countries to fulfill their so-called sacred mission of educating colored people." The editorial pointed out that if colonialism is eliminated in the Asian and African regions, the current world tension can be largely eliminated.

    印度尼西亚总理说亚非会议将如期举行
    【新华社雅加达二十八日电】印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约二十七日对记者们说，关于亚非会议延期的谣言是没有根据的，会议将按原定日期举行。
    据安塔拉通讯社消息，印度尼西亚情报部长杜斌二十六日到达棉兰时对记者们说，从技术上讲，亚非会议的准备工作完成了百分之八十到九十。
    【新华社雅加达二十七日电】印度尼西亚“警惕报”评论即将举行的亚非会议说，“在万隆会议上，有色人民将在历史上第一次在没有西方国家参与的情况下决定他们的命运。亚非国家会议将对一切殖民地人民表明，他们不再是乳牛，他们能够成为他们自己家里的主人。”评论指出，西方国家应该牢牢记住亚非人民的这种愿望。
    “印度尼西亚观察家报”二十六日发表社论说，“在亚洲和北非，殖民主义并没有被埋葬。西伊里安、果阿、马来亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥便是例子，在那里，殖民势力今日仍然在作祟。在这些地区内继续保持殖民统治，是对自决权和人权的悍然侵犯。”社论说，“这真是一个悲惨的讽刺：直到目前为止，千百万人民仍然遭受着殖民国家的奴役，而唯一的根本站不住脚的理由是为了西方国家希望完成它们的所谓教育有色人种的神圣使命。”社论指出，如果消除亚洲和非洲地区内的殖民主义，就可以在很大程度上消除目前世界的紧张局势。
