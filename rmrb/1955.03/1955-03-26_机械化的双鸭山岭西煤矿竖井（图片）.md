    Mechanized Shuangyashan Lingshi Coal Mine Vertical Shaft
    The newly built Lingshi Coal Mine vertical shaft of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau in Heilongjiang Province has been put into production.
    These vertical shafts were designed and constructed by our country's workers under the guidance of Soviet experts. The entire production process of the vertical shafts, from coal cutting to coal transportation, is basically mechanized. There are also safety facilities such as health stations, explosion-proof power distribution devices, safety fire prevention, waterproof doors, and fire prevention trains installed underground.
    The Shuangyashan Lingshi vertical shaft will produce a large amount of high-quality coking coal to support the steel industry.

    Explosion-proof power distribution boxes and fire prevention, waterproof safety doors and other equipment installed underground ensure the safety of miners' production. Here, workers are studying the power supply situation in the underground substation.
    Miners excitedly discuss the high-quality coking coal mined by combined coal mining machines.
    Medical staff at the Lingshi vertical shaft clinic are preparing to provide electrotherapy to the miners.
    In order to further expand the mining area, surveyors continue to measure permanent points in the first track underground.
    Trains loaded with high-quality coking coal are steadily departing from Lingshi.

    机械化的双鸭山岭西煤矿竖井
    我国新建的黑龙江省双鸭山矿务局岭西煤矿竖井，已投入生产。
    这对竖井是我国职工在苏联专家指导下自己设计和施工的。竖井的全部生产过程，从割煤到运煤基本上都是机械化的。在井下还设有保健站、防爆配电装置、安全防火、防水门和防火列车等安全设备。
    双鸭山岭西竖井将生产大量的优质炼焦煤，支援钢铁工业。

    井下设置的防爆配电箱和防火、防水安全门等设备，保证了矿工们生产的安全。这是工人们正在井下变电所研究电力的供应情况。
    矿工们兴奋地谈论着用联合采煤机开采的质地优良的炼焦煤。
    岭西竖井卫生所的医务人员正准备给矿工们进行电疗。
    为了进一步扩大采煤区，测量员继续在井下测量第一轨道中的永久点。
    满载优质炼焦煤的火车，正从岭西源源开出。
