Anshan Iron and Steel's Garbage Still Contains Large Quantities of Metal Materials

    On December 19, 1954, the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily published a criticism from readers Ding Zhilin and others regarding the Anshan Iron and Steel Company treating large quantities of metal materials as garbage. On January 4 this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company submitted a self-criticism to the People's Daily through the Ministry of Heavy Industry. They admitted that the reader's "criticism is correct" and that it "greatly helps to improve the enterprise's management"; and they adopted five measures to correct the shortcomings and errors: (1) Strengthen education for employees on cherishing national property. The company has instructed each factory and mine director to make a self-criticism, which will be announced to all employees along with the reader's letter published in the People's Daily, and to organize discussions. (2) Instruct each factory to establish a dedicated person to supervise garbage loading to prevent useful materials from being mixed in. (3) Scattered waste steel and small parts in various factories are to be collected by a scavenging team organized by the scrap iron plant. (4) Designate the transportation department to do a good job of supervision. If useful items are found during the transportation of waste, transportation should be immediately stopped and reported to the company for handling. (5) Instruct the administrative office to conduct regular inspections. If similar problems are found again, different punishments will be given according to the severity of the circumstances.

    It is certainly good that Anshan Iron and Steel Company can accept criticism, conduct timely self-criticism, and express its intention to correct its mistakes. However, regrettably, the actual situation is not like this: After the People's Daily criticized Anshan Iron and Steel Company for discarding metal materials, the company's leading cadres did not immediately conduct research and take effective measures as stated in the "self-criticism." Even on the day the company wrote the self-criticism to the People's Daily (January 4), the two directors of the slag treatment plant, who were specifically responsible for managing waste metal matters, had not even seen the criticism in the People's Daily! The letters sent by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the newspaper to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company for inspection were held by Deputy Manager Song Yanchang for many days. It was not until January 13 that the company sent an instruction to various factories and mines and workshops on strengthening the recycling and management of waste steel. On January 30, the company instructed the administrative office to establish an inspection team. After that, a meeting was held to instruct each factory and workshop to establish a dedicated person to be responsible for this work. As for "The company has instructed each factory and mine director to make a self-criticism, which will be announced to all employees along with the reader's letter published in the People's Daily, and to organize discussions," etc., it was not implemented at all.

    Because there are many discrepancies between the company leadership's actual "measures" and what was said in the "self-criticism," the actual implementation of the company's instructions by various factories and workshops is even more discounted. Among the company's forty-three units, only nine units actually started to establish dedicated management, while the other thirty-four units basically remained the same. These units can be roughly divided into three categories:

    (1) After receiving the company's instructions, the factory-level leaders only made general arrangements, but lacked inspection and supervision, so they did not actually take action. The Metal Products Factory, the First Rolling Mill Workshop, and the Steelmaking Plant are all like this. Although the Steelmaking Plant also assigned a welfare assistant to be responsible, in reality no one was involved. Therefore, it is estimated that there are at least 600 tons of scrap steel in the garbage dump that have not been recycled.

    (2) After receiving the company's instructions, the factory directors and workshop directors only wrote "Comply" on the documents, and the documents were not passed down in a timely manner. Such as the Ironmaking Plant, the Ore Dressing Plant, the Second Thin Plate Plant, etc. When the Metallurgical Furnace Repair Plant received the company's instructions, it thought, "We are repairing furnaces, where do we get waste steel?" They didn't take it seriously, but in fact, the discarded waste refractory bricks contained a large amount of waste steel.

    (3) After receiving the company's instructions, they held the documents in their hands and did not make any arrangements. After the director of the Steel Casting Workshop received the instructions, he wrote "File" on them and that was it. The Large Rolling Mill, the First and Fourth Machine Repair Workshops, etc. all have similar situations.

    It is precisely because the company's leading cadres are only satisfied with writing "self-criticisms" and issuing "instructions" that the serious waste phenomenon of large quantities of metal materials being discarded as garbage continues. On February 9, the Anshan Workers' Life Daily published many reader's letters expressing dissatisfaction with this situation.

    People's dissatisfaction is completely justified. Please look at the following heartbreaking figures: In 1954 alone, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company purchased 600,040 tons of scrap steel in the suburbs of Anshan and other places, paying a total of 51.9 billion old yuan. Among them, from August to December 1954, the scrap steel automatically picked up by employees in their spare time alone reached 5,394 tons. The bonus expenditure alone reached 403 million old yuan. Eighty family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and impoverished households organized by the Anshan Civil Affairs Bureau picked up 453 tons of scrap steel in forty days. These scraps of steel were purchased by the company, and the average price was 600,000 old yuan per ton, reaching more than 270 million old yuan. These people can earn at least 50,000 old yuan per day, which greatly exceeds the basic salary of senior workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

    It is time to close this loophole! Otherwise, a beautiful "self-criticism" will become an excuse for criticism. Yang Hui

### 鞍钢的垃圾裹仍有大批金属材料

    鞍钢的垃圾裹仍有大批金属材料
    一九五四年十二月十九日，人民日报“读者来信专页”上刊登了读者丁祉林等对于鞍山钢铁公司把大批金属材料当作垃圾的批评。今年一月四日，鞍山钢铁公司经由重工业部交给人民日报一篇检讨。他们承认读者“批评是正确的”，“对改进企业的经营管理有着很大的帮助”；并且采取了五项措施来改正缺点和错误：（一）对职工加强爱护国家资财的教育。公司已责成各厂、矿长作出检讨，连同人民日报上发表的读者来信向全体职工公布，并组织讨论。（二）责成各厂设立专人，负责监督垃圾装车，不使有用物资混入。（三）散在各厂的废钢铁和小零件，责成碎铁厂组织收集队搜集。（四）指定运输部门作好监督工作，如在运输废物时发现有用的东西，立即停止运输并报公司处理。（五）责成行政处作好定期检查，如再发现类似问题，根据情节轻重，给予不同处分。
    鞍山钢铁公司能够接受批评，及时检讨，表示要改正错误，这当然是好的。但是，遗憾的是实际情况却不是这样：人民日报批评了鞍山钢铁公司丢弃金属材料以后，公司的领导干部并没有像“检讨”中说的那样，立刻进行研究和采取有效措施。甚至当公司向人民日报写检讨的那天（一月四日），具体负责管理废金属事项的矿渣处理场的两位主任还没有见到人民日报的批评哩！重工业部和报社寄来让鞍山钢铁公司检查的信件，在宋彦昌副经理手里压了好些日子。直到一月十三日，公司才给各厂矿、车间发去一份关于加强废钢铁回收和管理的指示。一月三十日公司才责成行政处等成立检查组。之后，才开会责成各厂、车间设立专人负责这一工作。至于“公司已责成各厂、矿长作出检讨，连同人民日报上发表的读者来信向全体职工公布，并组织讨论”等，根本没有实行。
    由于公司领导方面的实际“措施”和“检讨”书上所说的有很多出入，所以各厂、车间贯彻公司指示的实际情况，就更打折扣了。公司所属的四十三个单位，真正着手设立专人管理的只有九个单位，其他三十四个单位基本上还是原来的模样。这些单位大体上可以分成三类：
      （一）接到公司指示以后，厂级领导只是一般地布置，但缺乏检查督促，实际上没有动起来。金属制品厂、第一轧辊车间和炼钢厂都是这个样子。炼钢厂虽然也指定福利助理员负责，但实际上仍然是无人沾手，因此，垃圾堆里估计最少还有六百多吨废钢没有回收。
    （二）接到公司指示以后，厂长、车间主任只在文件上批“照办”，而文件没有及时传达下去。如炼铁厂、选矿厂、第二薄板厂等。冶金炉修理厂当接到公司指示后，认为“我们是修理炉子的，哪来废钢铁？”不以为意，而实际上他们扔掉的废耐火砖里，便夹有大量的废钢铁。
    （三）接到公司指示后，把文件压在手里，不作任何布置。铸钢车间主任接到指示以后，在上面批“存卷”两字就完事。大型轧钢厂、第一、四机修车间等都有类似情形。
    正因为公司的领导干部只满足于写“检讨”和发“指示”，大批金属材料被当作垃圾扔掉的严重浪费现象仍然在继续着。二月九日，鞍山工人生活报上便刊登许多读者来信，对这种情形表示不满。
    人们的不满是完全有理由的，请看下面这几个令人痛心的数字：鞍山钢铁公司在一九五四年一年中，在鞍山市郊和其他地方收购的废钢铁即达六十万零四十吨，支付金额达旧币五百一十九亿元。其中从一九五四年八月到十二月，仅职工在业余时间自动拣回的废钢铁达五千三百九十四吨。只奖金支出一项达旧币四亿零三百万元。鞍山市民政局组织的八十名烈属、军属和贫困户在四十天中拣了废钢铁达四百五十三吨。这些废钢铁由公司收购，平均价格每吨以旧币六十万元计算，达旧币二亿七千多万元。这些人每天最少可收入旧币五万元，大大超过了鞍山钢铁公司高级工人的基本工资。
    是堵塞这个漏洞的时候了！否则，漂亮的“检讨”便会变成对批评的搪塞。　杨慧
