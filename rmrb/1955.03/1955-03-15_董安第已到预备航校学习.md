    【新华社十三日讯】爱国青年董安第已在中国人民解放军空军预备航空学校开始学习第一课：
  “人民空军战士的任务、品质和作风”。他已向学校递交了一份学习保证书，保证自己虚心地向老战士学习，学好各项课程。老战士们都热情地教导他军事基本操法和其他学习课程。休息时，有的老战士还讲过去的战斗故事给他听。
    这几天，董安第特别兴奋。当他来到空军预备航空学校报到时，许多老战士都跑出来欢迎他。老战士们替他背行李，带他到营房去安置床位。董安第所在的中队还举行了一个欢迎会，部队首长在会上赞扬他的爱国主义精神，老战士的代表也表示要尽力帮助他迅速掌握各种技术。
    董安第对记者说：“我深深感到：在我们可爱的祖国里，只要你有宏大的志愿，就一定能够实现！为了解放台湾，为了保卫我们可爱的祖国，我一定努力学习，把自己的一切力量献给国家！”
