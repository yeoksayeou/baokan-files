In the vast grasslands and rural areas of Qinghai Province, every county people's government seat will be able to communicate with other places by telephone or telegram. In agricultural areas, many districts and townships have already installed telephones. In the Xunhua Salar Autonomous Region, thirty-one of the thirty-seven agricultural production cooperatives can now communicate with the county by telephone, promptly reporting work and receiving instructions. This year, the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration will begin wireless telegraph services in Zeku County of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region, Huashixia of the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Region, and Qilian and Ebo of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Region; install wireless telephones between Xining and the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Region; and erect wired telephones between Xining and Tongren County of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region. In order to adapt to the development of resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin, the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration will also establish a post and telecommunications bureau in Golmud recently, and will send fifteen mobile service teams to go deep into various construction sites to carry out postal services and distribute books, newspapers, and magazines. Before liberation, the people in pastoral areas had never seen newspapers. Now, except for a few counties, the people in the county people's government seats of pastoral areas, districts along the highway, and many districts and townships in agricultural areas can directly subscribe to new books, newspapers, and magazines at the local post and telecommunications bureau.

    青海草原农村增加邮电设备
    在青海省辽阔的草原和农村，每个县人民政府所在地都将能够和外地通电话或电报了。在农业地区，不少区、乡已经装上了电话。循化县撒拉族自治区三十七个农业生产合作社，已有三十一个可以和县里通电话，及时汇报工作并得到指示。省邮电管理局今年将在黄南藏族自治区泽库县，果洛藏族自治区花石峡，海北藏族自治区祁连、俄博等地开始无线电报营业；在西宁到果洛藏族自治区之间装设无线电话；在西宁到黄南藏族自治区同仁县之间架设有线电话。为了适应柴达木盆地资源勘察工作的发展，省邮电管理局最近还要在格尔穆设立邮电局，并将派出十五个流动服务小组，深入各个工地，开办邮政业务和发行书报、杂志工作。解放前，牧业区人民从来没有看到过报纸，现在除了个别县份外，牧区各县人民政府所在地、沿公路线的区和农业区许多区、乡人民，都能在当地的邮电局直接订购新的书报、杂志了。　（新华社）
