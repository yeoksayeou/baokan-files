    The Southwest Region is Helping Ethnic Minorities Transform Mountain Production
    Li Zonghai, Wan Tao
    The Southwest Region has approximately eight million ethnic minorities living in or interspersed throughout mountainous areas, accounting for about 50% of the total ethnic minority population in the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang. This includes the Miao, Yi, Buyi, Tibetan, Yao, Lisu, Hani, Jingpo, Lahu, and Kawa ethnic groups, distributed across the entire province of Guizhou, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, the Yunnan border region, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan.
    Mountainous areas share several common characteristics: (1) They are generally located on the border edges of provinces and counties, with high mountains and long distances, poor transportation, scattered villages, and sparse populations; (2) Natural disasters are frequent, production is backward, iron farm tools are lacking, and "slash-and-burn," "extensive planting with meager harvests," and "shifting cultivation" are the main farming methods; (3) There is great land potential and abundant local and special products; (4) Farmers have a certain habit of mutual aid in labor; (5) Work progresses slower than in the plains, and the foundation for work is weak. Overall, agricultural production generally remains in a self-sufficient natural economic stage.
    In order to change the production techniques and natural environment of these areas, develop various cash crops suitable for mountain production to meet national needs, and promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement, thereby fundamentally changing the backward state of ethnic minorities in mountainous areas, it is necessary to steadily and systematically implement transformation in the mountains.
    The Southwest Region's mountain transformation work began with addressing the shortage of iron farm tools. In the mountainous areas of the Southwest, "slash-and-burn," "extensive planting with meager harvests," and "shifting cultivation" are the main farming methods. Farmers generally use backward production tools such as bamboo and wooden implements, and iron tools are severely lacking. The exertion of farmers' productivity and the potential of the land are greatly limited. In order to develop production and change this backward state, the Southwest Regional Committee of Finance and Economy of the former Southwest Military and Administrative Committee decided at the Southwest Regional Ethnic Minority Economic Work Conference in late 1952 to help people of all ethnic groups in the mountains solve the problem of lacking iron farm tools through state investment, so that they could fundamentally change the state of "slash-and-burn" within two to three years. In 1953, 40.8 billion old currency was invested to produce and distribute more than 1.3 million pieces of various iron farm tools. In Guizhou Province alone, 170,000 farmers received free farm tools. In 1954, another 38 billion old currency was allocated for free farm tools.
    In areas where land reform has been implemented, the distribution of free farm tools has triggered a series of changes in mountain production, significantly improving the labor efficiency and production enthusiasm of mountain farmers. The situation of slash-and-burn, extensive planting with meager harvests, and fallow abandonment has changed, and arable land has begun to become fixed. On this basis, farmers have begun to accept relatively advanced farming techniques. For example, farmers of Miao, Dong, and Buyi ethnic groups in Leishan, Liping, and Ceheng areas of Guizhou Province used to "cultivate one season and plant one season," and "abandoned reclaimed wasteland for cultivated wasteland." After receiving farm tools, they increased their confidence in management, and some dug drainage ditches, built fences, and built retaining walls around their land to fix the land. After learning to use iron farm tools, some farmers in Yunnan took the initiative to abandon the "extensive planting with meager harvests" management method. In the past, Weining's Ninth District in Guizhou had only one iron-toothed rake in the entire district, and most farmers used wooden harrows. In 1953, the county distributed more than 20,000 pieces of various free farm tools. After iron harrows replaced wooden harrows, labor efficiency was significantly improved. In the past, each person could only plow half a load of land per day. In 1953, using oxen to pull iron plows increased efficiency by about tenfold, and land that had been abandoned due to lack of farm tools was also cultivated.
    Although the supply of iron farm tools cannot be completely resolved at present, the situation has greatly changed. While distributing free farm tools, the masses are also guided to gradually shift from "slash-and-burn" and "intermittent rotation" farming methods to fixed arable land and land improvement. The specific approach is generally to make the masses realize that fixing arable land and improving land can increase production through detailed accounting, and they will voluntarily stop or reduce slash-and-burn and fully use their labor force for land improvement to increase yield per unit area. In the past, Lianfu Township, Changning County, Yunnan, had 230 mu of "slash-and-burn" land. After Li Sheng, a farmer in the township, fixed his arable land, his output increased from four baskets to eleven baskets. The local area educated the farmers in the township to implement fixed arable land through this example. In 1953, the area of "slash-and-burn" land in the township decreased by 80%, and the saved labor force was used for the processing of rice fields and other crops, so the township increased production by 80%. However, to guide farmers to fix arable land and improve land, it is necessary to first eliminate farmers' ideological concerns and proceed on a voluntary basis. Some areas did not proceed from the farmers' level of awareness and forcibly prohibited burning mountains, and did not guide farmers to fix arable land, resulting in reduced production. For example, some townships in Tengchong County, Yunnan, were eager to achieve success and forced farmers to fix arable land and stop planting buckwheat and upland rice, but did not tell farmers to change to other crops, resulting in a reduction of about four to five million catties in the county. Therefore, when implementing fixed arable land in mountainous areas, it is necessary to proceed from the farmers' level of awareness and the current production situation in various places, proceed steadily on the basis of the farmers' conscious voluntariness through specific accounting methods, and at the same time help farmers solve various difficulties after fixing arable land, so that the farmers' production enthusiasm is combined with the improvement of production technology. After fixing arable land, it is also necessary to guide farmers to improve farming techniques, do a good job of land improvement, promote plowing with cattle, replace human power with cattle power, build small-scale water conservancy projects, strive to turn sloping land into dry land and dry land into paddy fields, educate farmers to accumulate fertilizer and apply fertilizer, gradually eliminate white paddy fields, and ensure increased yield per unit area.
    Mountain farmers have many difficulties, heavy disasters, and scattered cultivation. Therefore, in the long process of production, they have formed the habit of exchanging labor and helping each other. They have combined into many different forms of mutual assistance in various productions. This historical habit and form of exchanging labor and helping each other is one of the favorable conditions for carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in mountainous areas. In the key transformation townships in mountainous areas of the Southwest Region where land reform has been carried out, mutual aid and cooperative organizations have been developed to varying degrees. In Yunnan Province, the general development has reached 80% of the households that should be organized, and in Guizhou Province, it is also about 50%. Although the mutual aid and cooperation movement has not developed healthily enough, the majority of farmers have initially realized the superiority of being organized. Carrying out mutual aid and cooperation is an important guarantee for mountain transformation. It is necessary to combine the experiences of various places on the basis of the original forms of mutual aid, and gradually organize the masses according to the different characteristics of mountain production types, seasonal differences, and production methods. The specific methods are generally: (1) Rely on ethnic minority cadres, party members, league members, and activists to help them learn policies, start by solving current production difficulties, closely combine with production, and gradually deepen the mutual aid and cooperation policy into the hearts of the people on the basis of the original exchange of labor and mutual assistance; (2) Seize the busy farming season, vigorously call for exchange of labor and mutual assistance, and promptly help summarize the benefits of exchanging labor and mutual assistance. Educate the masses with living examples, and improve the original forms of exchanging labor and mutual assistance to fix them into mutual aid teams under the principle of doing a good job in production; (3) Expand the scope and content of exchanging labor and mutual assistance. Exchanging labor and mutual assistance can be vigorously promoted in fighting against various natural disasters, building water conservancy projects, hunting, catching pests, and planting trees, protecting forests, cultivating forests, and logging in areas with mountains and forests, so as to consolidate and develop the organizations of exchanging labor and mutual assistance; (4) On the basis of consolidating and improving existing work, actively and steadily develop various types of and comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives, and gradually make mutual aid and cooperative organizations the main form of production in mountainous areas. However, in areas where villages are too scattered, the conditions for establishing cooperatives are not sufficient, and there are more difficulties, it is generally not appropriate to establish cooperatives at present, and mutual aid teams should be developed in large numbers.
    Mountainous areas in the Southwest are very rich in local and special products and sideline production, generally accounting for 30% of farmers' total income, and in some areas as high as 80%. Forestry and animal husbandry also account for a large proportion of production in some mountainous areas. For example, forestry in eastern Guizhou and animal husbandry in western Guizhou are the main sources of livelihood for local people. Therefore, while doing a good job in agricultural production, developing mountain forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and handicrafts is an important way to adapt to the characteristics of mountainous areas and solve the difficulties of farmers in mountainous areas in terms of living and production materials. In addition, cold-resistant, early-maturing, and high-yielding crops suitable for the characteristics of mountainous areas, such as red rice, sweet potatoes, and potatoes, should be promoted and popularized to increase farmers' grain income and solve the difficulties of disasters or insufficient food rations.
    In order to support the mountain transformation work, it is also necessary to strengthen the economic work in the mountains. Therefore, various loans and grain loans must be made in a timely and conscientious manner to help mountain farmers solve production difficulties. The supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trade work in mountainous areas must be closely combined with the production seasons in mountainous areas and the needs of people of all ethnic groups for living and production, and organize supplies in coordination with various loans. According to the characteristics of scattered villages and vast areas in mountainous areas, more mobile trade teams should be organized to go to the countryside to combine supply with the purchase of local and special products and sideline products. Establish primary markets in a focused manner and strengthen the exchange of materials. Give full play to the strength of supply and marketing cooperatives, and make supply and marketing cooperation the basic form of supplying farmers in mountainous areas with production materials and living materials and purchasing local and special products. Natural disasters are particularly frequent in mountainous areas. In 1954, there were 49 counties in mountainous areas of the Southwest that suffered serious production reductions due to animal damage. At the same time, due to climate and backward farming techniques, pests and diseases, as well as drought, floods, wind, hail, and other disasters also occur constantly, and some mountainous areas have become historical disaster areas. Therefore, fighting against natural disasters, especially preventing and eliminating animal damage, is an important issue in mountain production. In order to ensure mountain production, the CCP committees and people's governments in these areas have conscientiously implemented the central government's policy of prevention over treatment, educated cadres to recognize the severity of natural disasters in mountainous areas, established the idea of fighting against natural disasters for a long time, and formulated appropriate reward measures to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses.
    In the mountainous areas of the Southwest, especially in the high mountain areas, villages are scattered, transportation is very difficult, there are still estrangements between ethnic groups, the problems left over from land reform have not been well resolved, the difficulties in farmers' production are greater than in the plains, and the foundation of the work of the Party and the government is still very weak. To this end, party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over mountain production, continuously conduct ideological education for mountain cadres, make them realize that mountain transformation is a part of the country's socialist transformation cause, and that helping ethnic minorities in mountainous areas develop production is a glorious and arduous task, and establish the idea of serving ethnic minorities for a long time. It is also necessary to attach importance to cultivating ethnic minority cadres and activists, develop party members and league members through various tasks of mountain transformation, establish party and league organizations, and establish the political core for leading mountain production work. In the work, it is necessary to implement ethnic policies everywhere, consolidate the rural front on the basis of ethnic unity, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The customs and habits of local ethnic groups that are not conducive to production should be gradually changed under the principle of patient persuasion and education and with the consent of the ethnic minority people and their leaders. It is also possible to organize mutual visits and exchanges of experience between farmers in mountainous areas and farmers in plains in a planned manner.
    Over the past year or so, the Southwest has made great achievements in carrying out mountain transformation work, laying a solid foundation for future mountain transformation work. For example, in 1953, a total of 2,340 mountain townships in the inland mountainous areas of Yunnan Province were transformed, including 503 key townships and 1,837 general townships. In addition to providing assistance and relief through bank loans to farmers of all ethnic groups in these townships, the state invested 10 million old currency in each key transformation township and 4.5 million old currency in each general township, with a total investment of 16.2 billion old currency in the province to help farmers of all ethnic groups develop production. According to incomplete statistics, 465 of the 483 key townships increased production, accounting for 96.3%, with the highest increase being 150%, the average increase being 50%, and the lowest increase being 5%. Of the 758 general townships, 726 townships increased production, accounting for 95.6%, with the highest increase being 200%, the average increase being 30%, and the lowest increase being 5%.

    西南地区是怎样帮助少数民族改造山区生产的
    李宗海　宛涛
    西南地区约有八百万人口的少数民族聚居或杂居在山区，约占云、贵、川、康等省少数民族总人口的百分之五十左右，包括苗、彝、布依、藏、瑶、傈僳、哈尼、景颇、拉祜、佧瓦等民族，分布在贵州全省、西康藏族自治区、凉山彝族自治区、云南边疆和四川藏族自治区。
    山区有着一些共同的特点：（一）一般都处于省和省、县和县交接的边沿地带，山高路远，交通闭塞，村寨分散，地广人稀；（二）自然灾害多，生产落后，铁制农具缺乏，“刀耕火种”“广种薄收”“游垦轮歇”的耕作方法在生产中占主要地位；（三）土地潜力大，土产特产丰富；（四）农民在过去就有一定的劳动互助习惯；（五）工作开展比坝区较慢，工作基础薄弱。总的看来，农业生产，一般还停滞在自给自足的自然经济阶段。
    为了改变这些地区的生产技术和自然环境，发展为国家需要的、适合山区生产的多种经济作物，发展互助合作运动，以从根本上改变山区少数民族在生产上的落后状态，就必须稳步地、有计划地对山区实行改造。
    西南地区进行山区改造工作是从解决铁质农具入手的。西南山区“刀耕火种”“广种薄收”“游垦轮歇”的耕作方法在生产中占主要地位，农民普遍使用竹器，木器等落后的生产工具，铁器十分缺乏。农民生产力和土地潜在力的发挥都受到极大的限制。为了发展生产，改变这种落后状态，一九五二年底原西南军政委员会财政经济委员会召开的西南区少数民族经济工作会议上决定以国家投资方式，帮助山区各族人民解决缺乏铁质农具问题，使他们能在两三年内基本上改变“刀耕火种”的状态。一九五三年投资旧币四○八亿元，制发各种铁质农具一百三十多万件，仅贵州一省就有十七万户农民得到了无偿农具。一九五四年又继续发放了旧币三百八十亿元的无偿农具款。
    在已实行土地改革的地区，无偿农具的发放，引起了山区生产上一系列的变化，显著地提高了山区农民的劳动效率和生产积极性。刀耕火种，广种薄收，轮歇丢荒的情况有了改变，耕地开始固定。在这个基础上，农民已开始接受比较先进的耕作技术。如贵州雷山、黎平、册亨一带的苗、侗、布依等族农民，过去是“开一季种一季”，“开了生荒丢熟荒”，领到农具后，提高了经营的信心，有的在自己的土地周围挖排水沟、扎篱笆、砌堡坎，把土地固定起来了。云南有些山区农民学会使用铁质农具后，主动放弃了“广种薄收”的经营方法。贵州威宁九区过去全区只有一架铁齿耙，绝大部分农民使用木?木耙，一九五三年该县发放各种无偿农具两万多件，铁质农具代替了木?木耙后，劳动效率有了显著提高。过去每人每天只能翻半挑地，一九五三年用牛拉铁?，效率提高约十倍，原来由于农具缺乏丢荒了的土地也耕种起来了。
    目前铁质农具的供应问题虽然还不能完全解决，但是情况已经有了很大的改变。在发放无偿农具的同时又引导群众从“刀耕火种”、“间歇轮耕”的耕作方法逐渐地转变到固定耕地实行土地加工方面来。其具体做法一般是通过算细账的办法，使群众体会到固定耕地土地加工可以增加生产，自愿地停止或减少刀耕火种，把劳动力充分使用到土地加工上来，提高单位面积产量。云南昌宁县联福乡过去“刀耕火种”的地有二百三十亩，这个乡的农民李升固定耕地后，产量从四箩增至十一箩。当地就通过这一事例教育全乡农民实行固定耕地，一九五三年全乡“刀耕火种”面积就减少百分之八十，省出的劳动力用于稻田和其他作物的加工，因而全乡增产百分之八十。但引导农民固定耕地，实行土地加工必须首先解除农民思想顾虑，在自愿的基础上进行。有些地区没有从农民的觉悟水平出发，硬禁止放火烧山，又没有引导农民固定耕地，因而造成减产。如云南腾冲县有些乡急于求成，强迫农民固定耕地，停止种苦荞、旱谷，而又不告诉农民改种其他作物，结果全县减产约四百万到五百万斤。因此在山区实行固定耕地时必须从农民觉悟程度和各地生产现状出发，通过具体算账的办法，在农民自觉自愿的基础上稳步进行，同时要帮助农民解决固定耕地后的各种困难，使农民生产积极性与生产技术的改进结合起来。固定耕地以后还必须指导农民改进耕作技术搞好土地加工，提倡牛耕田，以牛力代替人力，兴修小型水利，争取变坡地为旱田，变旱田为水田，教育农民积肥、施肥、逐步消灭白水田，保证提高单位面积产量。
    山区农民困难多，灾害重，耕作分散，因而在长期的生产过程中形成了换工互助的习惯，在多种多样的生产中已结合成很多不同的互助形式。这种历史上的换工互助习惯和形式，是开展山区互助合作运动的有利条件之一。在西南地区已进行土地改革的山区重点改造乡，互助合作组织有了不同程度的发展。云南省一般发展到应组织起来农户的百分之八十，贵州省也在百分之五十左右。虽然互助合作运动发展得还不够健康，但广大农民已初步认识到组织起来的优越性。开展互助合作是山区改造的重要保证，必须根据山区的生产种类、季节差别和生产方法等不同特点，在原有互助形式的基础上，结合各地经验，把群众逐步组织起来。具体作法一般是：（一）依靠少数民族干部、党员、团员、积极分子，帮助他们学会政策，从解决当前生产困难入手，紧紧结合生产，在原有换工互助的基础上，使互助合作政策逐步深入人心；（二）抓住农忙季节，大力号召换工互助，及时帮助总结换工互助的好处，以活人活事教育群众，在搞好生产的原则下，提高原有换工互助的形式，固定成为互助组；（三）扩大换工互助的范围和内容。在同各种自然灾害进行斗争、兴修水利、狩猎、捕捉害虫，以及在有山林地区的植树、护林、育林、伐木等方面，都可以大力提倡换工互助，借以巩固和发展换工互助的组织；（四）在巩固和提高现有工作的基础上，积极稳步地发展各种类型的和综合性的农、林、牧业生产合作社，逐步使互助合作组织成为山区生产中的主要形式。但在村寨过于分散，办社条件不够，且困难更多的地区，目前一般不宜办社，应大量发展互助组。
    西南山区土产特产和副业生产非常丰富，一般占农民总收入的百分之三十，个别地区达百分之八十左右，林业、牧业在某些山区生产上也占很大的比重，如黔东林业、黔西牧业都是当地群众的主要生活来源。因此，在做好农业生产的同时，发展山区林业、牧业、副业、手工业等生产，是适应山区特点，解决山区农民生活和生产资料困难的重要途径。此外还应提倡和推广适应山区特点的耐寒、早熟和多产作物，如红米、红苕、马铃薯等，增加农民的粮食收入，解决灾荒或口粮不足的困难。
    为了支持山区改造工作，还必须加强山区的经济工作。因此要及时认真作好各项贷款、贷粮工作，帮助山区农民解决生产上的困难。山区供销合作社和国营贸易工作，要密切结合山区的生产季节与各族人民生活、生产的需要，配合各项贷款组织供应。根据山区村寨分散，地区辽阔的特点，宜多组织流动贸易组下乡，使供应同收购土产特产及副业产品相结合。有重点地建立初级市场，加强物资交流。充分发挥供销合作社的力量，使供销合作成为供应山区农民生产资料、生活资料和收购土特产品的基本形式。山区自然灾害特别多，一九五四年西南各地山区因兽害而严重减产的就有四十九个县，同时由于气候及耕作技术落后等原因，病虫害及旱、涝、风、雹等灾害也不断发生，有些山区已成为历史性的灾区。因此同自然灾害作斗争，特别是防除兽害是山区生产中的重要问题。为保证山区生产，这些地区的中共党委和人民政府都认真贯彻中央防重于治的方针，教育干部认识山区自然灾害的严重性，树立长期同自然灾害作斗争的思想，并制定了适当的奖励办法，以鼓励群众的积极性。
    西南山区，特别是高山地带，村寨分散，交通非常困难，民族之间还有隔阂，土地改革后遗留的问题还没有很好解决，农民生产中的困难比坝区多，党和政府的工作基础还很薄弱。为此，各级党委必须加强对山区生产的领导，不断地对山区干部进行思想教育，使他们认识山区改造是国家社会主义改造事业的一部分，帮助山区少数民族发展生产是光荣艰巨的任务，树立长期为少数民族服务的思想。并要重视培养少数民族干部和积极分子，通过山区改造的各项工作，发展党员、团员，建立党、团组织，建立领导山区生产工作的政治核心。在工作中必须处处贯彻民族政策，在民族团结的基础上，巩固农村阵地，发挥群众生产的积极性。对于当地民族中不利于生产的风俗习惯，在耐心说服教育和少数民族人民及其领袖人物同意的原则下，逐步加以改变。并可有计划地组织山区农民同坝区农民的互相访问，交流经验。
    一年多来，西南在进行山区改造工作中，取得了很大的成绩，给今后山区改造工作打下了坚实的基础。如云南省内地山区一九五三年已进行改造的山区乡共二千三百四十个，其中重点乡五百零三个，一般乡一千八百三十七个。对这些乡的各族农民除银行贷款予以扶助救济外，国家对每一重点改造乡投资旧币一千万元，对一般乡投资旧币四百五十万元，全省共投资旧币一百六十二亿元，帮助各族农民发展生产。据不完全统计，在四百八十三个重点乡中增产的有四百六十五个，占百分之九六点三，其中最高的增产百分之一百五十，平均增产百分之五十，最低增产百分之五。在七百五十八个一般乡中，增产的有七百二十六个乡，占百分之九五点六，其中最高的增产百分之二百，平均增产百分之三十，最低增产百分之五。
