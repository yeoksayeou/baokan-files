Sichuan Encourages Farmers to Increase Livestock Production

The Sichuan Provincial People's Committee has decided to encourage the development of oxen and hog production. From now on, for each cow, horse, or mule born to a farmer, the government will award 30 jin of fine grains (deducted from the agricultural tax due in the autumn of that year) and allow the farmer to prioritize purchasing 50 jin of grain from the state grain market as feed. For farmers who have difficulties raising livestock, the government will not only provide timely loans to help them, but also allocate 100 million jin of grain to be sold by supply and marketing cooperatives to farmers as pig feed. In order to rationally allocate oxen, the province has uniformly divided oxen procurement areas to prevent blind buying. Supply and marketing cooperatives will also supply 40,000 oxen.

    四川鼓励农民增产牲畜
    四川省人民委员会为鼓励发展耕牛毛猪生产，决定从现在起农民每生一头牛、马、骡，由政府奖给细粮三十斤（在当年农业税秋征中扣除），并允许优先在国家粮食市场购粮五十斤作为饲料。对饲养牲畜有困难的农民，政府除及时贷款帮助外，还调拨一亿斤粮食由供销合作社售给农民作为养猪饲料。为合理调剂耕牛，全省统一划分耕牛采购区，防止盲目抢购，供销合作社并供应耕牛四万只。
