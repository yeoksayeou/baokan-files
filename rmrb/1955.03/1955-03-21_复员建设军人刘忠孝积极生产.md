"Winning merits on the front lines, excelling in production after demobilization!" This is how the members of the Yahu Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, praise Liu Zhongxiao, a demobilized soldier, for his active participation in production. Recently, the cooperative members elected Liu Zhongxiao as the vice-chairman of the agricultural production cooperative and the leader of the Fifth Production Team.

Liu Zhongxiao previously received a Third-Class Merit award while serving in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He was demobilized in the spring of 1952. At that time, the unit leader encouraged him, "Demobilized soldiers returning home should actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and take the lead in improving agricultural production." He kept these words firmly in his mind. Shortly after returning home, he discussed with his wife how to improve agricultural production. He used the demobilization pay issued by the army to buy a donkey and also bought feed to raise two pigs. Then he joined a mutual aid team. He took the lead in working actively in the team and was soon elected as the deputy team leader. In the winter of 1953, when the state's general task for the transition period was being promoted in rural areas, Liu Zhongxiao, based on the demands of the masses, led the mutual aid team to merge with two other teams to establish the Yahu Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. He was elected as a member of the cooperative's management committee.

In the winter of 1954, the Yahu Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative expanded from twenty-two households to seventy-five households. During the winter production campaign, the cooperative jointly formulated a plan to dig five wells in conjunction with four mutual aid teams. The water from the wells could irrigate more than seventy mu of land belonging to the cooperative and the teams. Coupled with the application of more fertilizer, this could increase grain production by at least 20,000 jin per year. In early December, sixty to seventy cooperative members and team members participated in well digging every day. In just over twenty days, four wells were completed. When digging the fifth well, the weather was very cold and the ground was frozen solid. Some people thought it was impossible to continue digging. Liu Zhongxiao, fearing that the winter digging would not be completed in time for spring plowing, patiently persuaded these people by citing the fact that last year, irrigated land in Yahu Village produced two to three hundred jin more grain per mu than dry land. At the same time, he led the cooperative members to use firewood to roast and pickaxes to break open the frozen ground. The cooperative members took turns working, digging more than two zhang deep in two days. Springs gushed from the bottom of the well, and everyone was very happy. But a new difficulty arose. It was necessary for someone to go into the water in the cold weather to build the well with stones. Liu Zhongxiao was the first to go into the water to build the well. Yang Dabing, a recently demobilized soldier who had returned home, saw this and jumped into the water as well. Then many cooperative members took turns going into the water to build the well. In one day, the well was completed. This matter quickly spread throughout Yahu Village. Some elderly farmers said with emotion: In the past, soldiers (referring to the old army) did not work when they returned home and were wastrels; now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, demobilized soldiers participate in agricultural production, and everyone is capable!

In February, when the Yahu Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative was formulating this year's production plan, the opinions of the cooperative members were inconsistent. According to the state plan, the cooperative should expand the area planted with peanuts. Most cooperative members were willing to plant more peanuts, but they were afraid of reducing the grain harvest. In addition, some cooperative members planned to plant more millet and taro, which would be convenient for their own consumption. Liu Zhongxiao believed that the agricultural production cooperative should formulate a production plan that takes into account the needs of the cooperative members while adhering to the state plan. He advocated expanding the peanut planting area and reducing the millet and taro planting area. At the same time, he suggested increasing grain income by planting high-yield crops such as potatoes. The cooperative's management committee agreed with his opinion. Together with the leading cadres of the cooperative and with the help of comrades sent by higher authorities to work in the village, he persuaded some of the cooperative members who initially disagreed with this approach. In the end, it was decided that the entire cooperative would plant eighty-three mu more peanuts this year than last year, and everyone was very satisfied.

    复员建设军人刘忠孝积极生产
    新华社记者　门宏　刘健生
    “前线打仗立功劳，复员生产是好汉！”这是山东省莱阳县崖后村农业生产合作社的社员们，称赞复员建设军人刘忠孝积极生产的话。最近，社员们选举刘忠孝担任了农业生产合作社的副社长兼第五生产队长。
    刘忠孝过去在中国人民解放军某部队立过三等功，一九五二年春天，复员回家。当时部队首长勉励他说：“复员建设军人回乡，要积极参加互助合作组织，带头搞好农业生产。”他把这句话牢牢地记在心里。回家不久，他就和妻子商量怎样搞好农业生产。他用部队发给的复员费买了一头驴，还买了饲料喂养两只猪。接着他参加了互助组。在组里他积极带头干活，不久就被选为副组长。一九五三年冬天，农村里宣传了国家在过渡时期的总任务，刘忠孝就根据群众的要求，带领互助组和其他两个组合并，成立了崖后村农业生产合作社。他被选为社管理委员会的委员。
    一九五四年冬季，崖后村农业生产合作社由二十二户扩大到七十五户。在开展冬季生产中，这个社联合四个互助组共同制订了打五眼井的计划。井里的水可以浇社和组的七十多亩地，加上多施肥料，每年至少能增产两万斤粮食。十二月初旬，每天都有六七十个社员和组员参加打井，打了二十多天，就打好了四眼井。打第五眼井的时候，天气很冷，地冻得很硬，有些人认为不能继续打井了。刘忠孝怕冬天打井打不完，会耽误春耕生产，就以崖后村去年水浇地比旱地每亩增产二三百斤粮食的事实耐心地说服了这些人。同时他还带领社员用柴火烤、用镐头刨来凿开冻地。社员们轮流着干，两天凿了两丈多深，井底泉涌，大家非常欢喜。可是新的困难又来了，当时需要人在寒冷的天气下水用石头砌井。刘忠孝首先下水砌井。回来不久的复员建设军人杨大宾看了，也跟着跳下水去。接着又有许多社员轮流着下水砌井。一天的时间就把井砌好了。这件事很快地传遍了崖后村，有些老年农民感动地说：过去当兵（指旧军队）回家不干活、摆浪子；现在共产党领导下，复员的军人参加农业生产，个个都能干！
    二月份，崖后村农业生产合作社在制订今年的生产计划时，社员们的意见不一致。按照国家计划，社里应当扩大花生种植面积。大多数社员愿意多种花生，但怕减少了粮食的收获量。另外有些社员打算多种谷子和芋头，自己吃用方便。刘忠孝认为农业生产合作社应当根据国家的计划同时照顾到社员的需要来制订生产计划，他主张扩大花生种植面积，减少谷子和芋头的种植面积。同时用种高产作物如种马铃薯等办法，来增加粮食的收入。社管理委员会同意他的意见。他和社的领导干部一道在上级派到村里工作的同志的帮助下，说服了起初不同意这样做的一些社员，最后确定全社今年比去年增种八十三亩花生，大家都很满意。
