The question of banning atomic weapons and the peaceful use of atomic energy has become one of the most pressing issues for people around the world. Whether atomic energy serves peace or war is not only related to the lives and safety of people in all countries, but also to the happiness and future of mankind.

The discovery of atomic energy is a great achievement of human wisdom and a sign of the high development of social productivity. From the creation of the atomic theory by the Greek philosopher Democritus in 400 BC to the recent mastery of the enormous energy contained in the atomic nucleus, which is only one billionth of a millimeter in size, mankind has traveled a long road and paid a huge price. However, this great achievement was unfortunately stolen by imperialism from the very beginning to serve its own base purposes; the first atomic bomb was dropped on the peaceful residents of Japan under the orders of Washington. Using such enormous atomic energy in this way, when the victorious situation of the anti-fascist war was already completely certain, could only have been intended to intimidate the people of all countries.

Since the atomic bombs exploded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people around the world have continuously demanded that these inhumane weapons be removed from the arsenals. In order to prevent atomic energy from being used again for mass destruction of life, people in various countries have waged persistent struggles over the years. The call for the prohibition of atomic weapons has resounded throughout the world, from south to north, from Europe to Asia.

However, the American ruling clique ignores the demands and aspirations of the people of the world, and they are going further and further down the opposite path. They openly use this weapon as the basis of their aggressive policies. In Congress, on the radio, and in all kinds of gatherings, American ministers, generals, diplomats, and congressmen incessantly and repeatedly clamor about atomic bombs and atomic warfare. When they draw their "defense line" into the territory of other countries, they flaunt the power of atomic bombs; when they extort more dollars from the American people, they incite the terror of atomic war.

The "monopoly of atomic weapons" has long ceased to exist, and the so-called "hydrogen bomb superiority" has now gone bankrupt, but the American rulers still place their bets on these ineffective magic weapons. They even collude with their North Atlantic partners to make plans for preparing for atomic war, and constantly spread so-called inevitable atomic war intimidation to this end. Does this not show that the atomic maniacs in Washington and their followers are afraid to admit that they have failed in the atomic race, and still hope to use illusions to prop up their power?

However, the atomic "policy of strength" is still being pursued after all. The United States' atomic weapons appropriations are increasing year by year, and atomic weapons tests are expanding one after another. In order to develop the production of atomic weapons, the American government has taken tens of billions of dollars from the pockets of ordinary people over the years. And what has this brought to the people? In today's America, people are living in a state of anxiety in the hysteria of atomic war. Children in New Jersey have to have their fingerprints taken, supposedly to facilitate the identification of corpses in the event of an atomic bomb attack! The Superintendent of Education in New York State has added new lessons for students: to conduct atomic bomb drills "as habitually as brushing their teeth every day." The crazy clamor and artificial intimidation about atomic weapons that fill all kinds of large and small newspapers and radio and television broadcasts have already made the residents of New York and Chicago apprehensive and dizzy. And things don't stop there. In order to expand the factories that manufacture hydrogen bombs, many towns in the United States have been razed to the ground, and thousands of farmers have been forced to abandon their homes. The residents of South Carolina asked: "It is difficult to understand why our towns have to be destroyed in order to make a bomb that destroys other people's towns?..."

Of course, it is by no means just the American people who are suffering. In Japan, the scars of the survivors of Hiroshima are still there, and the tears of mothers have not dried, but today many people have become victims of American hydrogen bomb tests. The angry cries of more than 20 million Japanese people demanding the prohibition of hydrogen bombs and other weapons of mass destruction are not without reason.

For Western European countries, the situation is also becoming more and more dangerous. People like Churchill embrace the United States as their patron and are willing to turn the British Isles into an American atomic aircraft carrier, allowing the United States to involve Britain in the slaughterhouse of atomic war. After the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting last December, the whole of Western Europe is in the forefront in any future war. And the ministers of Western European countries are still deceiving the people with all kinds of flowery words, telling them to believe in the safety of their situation.

The activities of the atomic maniacs have seriously threatened the safety of the people of all countries. People are asking: Why does it have to be this way? Can't atomic energy be used, and only be used, to benefit mankind?

Of course not. Everyone who cares about the fate of the world can get such an answer from the Soviet Union's just propositions and firm actions. From the very beginning, the Soviet Union has believed that atomic energy must serve peaceful purposes, not war purposes. The Soviet Union's attitude has been consistent. When it did not yet possess atomic weapons, it was like this; when it possessed atomic weapons and had a definite advantage, it was still like this. When American atomic scientists put on military uniforms and devoted themselves to developing weapons of mass destruction in military laboratories, Soviet scientists were working hard in their laboratories to ensure that atomic energy would benefit mankind as soon as possible. When the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission asserted that "we do not see that within twenty years, under the most favorable conditions, nuclear fuel will provide much of the world's electricity supply," the first atomic power station began generating electricity in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union proceeds from the interests of the people of the whole world. It not only cares about the safety and welfare of its own people, but also cares about the safety and welfare of the people of other countries; it not only cares about the present of mankind, but also cares about the future of mankind. In the Soviet Union's view: the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and the Louvre in Paris should be protected equally; the rebuilt Warsaw should not be destroyed again, but should be built more magnificent and comfortable on the basis of modern scientific discoveries, just as the residents of Coventry have no reason to make innocent sacrifices in a new war and have the right to demand that atomic energy be used for their benefit. Therefore, the Soviet Union not only does not believe that achievements in atomic energy science should be monopolized by a few countries, but is also very willing to make its research results public for the benefit of all mankind. The Soviet government has announced its decision to provide some countries with technical and scientific assistance in the peaceful use of atomic energy, which is concrete proof.

Today, a very broad prospect for the peaceful use of atomic energy is presented to the people of the world. If the Soviet Union's proposition is realized and atomic energy is used entirely to serve mankind, then the benefits to mankind will be immeasurable. The steam engine invented by the British mechanic James Watt in 1769 brought about a revolution in production, and the widespread application of atomic energy will transform the face of human life and open a new chapter in human history. Mankind will be able to use the forces of nature on a much wider scale and extend its activities into the entire space of the universe.

Soviet scientists have long pointed out that with atomic energy, people will be more able to transform nature and obtain electricity and heat anywhere far from water sources or coalfields. Barren land can be turned into fertile farmland, and remote mountains and wilderness can be built into prosperous cities. With atomic energy, people will be able to manage the weather, conquer mountains and seas, and greatly shorten spatial distances. Atomic energy can also cure intractable diseases and prolong human life; applied to all sciences, it will open up new horizons for mankind. Today people are only talking about fantasies of going to Mars, and at some time in the future, people may listen to the scientists who returned from Mars for the first time report their impressions of their journey with surprise and excitement, just like listening to Columbus's report on the discovery of the New World in 1492.

Since the advent of the steam engine, human society has progressed more in more than 100 years than in the previous thousands of years. The advent of the atomic age makes it possible for the economies of backward countries to rapidly advance to a modern level of development in a much shorter period of time.

All these beautiful prospects require the prohibition of atomic weapons and the complete use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The reason is very simple: large-scale peaceful use of atomic energy and large-scale development of atomic weapons are incompatible. This is also where Eisenhower's hypocritical so-called "Atoms for Peace" plan falls short. Why does the United States disagree with the immediate destruction of all atomic weapons stockpiles, but still massively manufactures and desperately advocates weapons of mass destruction? As long as atomic weapons are still in the hands of the enemies of peace, the prospect of world peace cannot but continue to be threatened, and the possibility of beautiful construction being destroyed remains. Between the victims in Hiroshima and the workers in the Soviet factories supplied with atomic power, between disaster and happiness, people know what to choose. No rhetoric can deceive them, and no intimidation can scare them. What the people demand is that all atomic energy—whether in the laboratory or in the factory, whether already developed or not yet developed—be used for the benefit of mankind.

The people's wishes will surely be realized. The Wall Street financial tycoons' attempt to use atomic bombs to save the increasingly corrupt capitalist system is as futile as trying to make the sun rise from the west. No matter how tortuous and difficult the road of scientific development may be, in the final analysis, it must serve its creators—mankind. This is the objective law of natural and social development, which cannot be stopped by any force or any obstacle. The power of hundreds of millions of people will surely subdue those who hold on to atomic bombs and refuse to let go, and the day when atomic energy fully serves the happiness of mankind will surely come.

    一定要和平利用原子能
    陈卓
    禁止原子武器与和平利用原子能的问题，已成为当前世界人民最关心的问题之一。原子能为和平还是为战争服务，这不仅关系到各国人民的生命和安全，而且也关系到人类的幸福和将来。
    原子能的发现，是人类智慧的伟大成果，是社会生产力高度发展的一个标志。从公元前四百年希腊哲学家德谟克利图斯创立原子学说，直到近年来掌握蕴藏在亿万分之一毫米大小的原子核里的巨大能量为止，人类是经过了漫长的路程和付出了巨大的代价的。但这个伟大的成果不幸一开始就被帝国主义窃取来为自己的卑劣目的服务；第一颗原子弹是按照华盛顿的命令，落在日本和平居民头上的。在当时反法西斯战争的胜利形势已经完全确定的情况下，这样来使用巨大的原子能，只能是为了达到恫吓各国人民的目的。
    自从原子弹在广岛和长崎爆炸以来，世界人民曾经不断地要求把这种不人道的武器从军火库里清除出去。为了不让原子能再被用于大规模毁灭生命，各国人民这些年来进行了坚持不移的斗争。禁止原子武器的呼声，从南到北，从欧洲到亚洲，已响遍了整个世界。
    但美国统治集团不顾世界人民的这种要求和热望，他们在相反的道路上走得愈来愈远了。他们公然用这种武器来作为自己侵略政策的基础。在国会里，在广播中间，在各种各样的集会上，美国的部长、将军、外交官员和议员先生们都喋喋不休地、翻来覆去地叫嚣着原子弹和原子战争。当他们把自己的“国防线”划入别国领土的时候，他们炫耀着原子弹的威力；当他们向美国人民搜刮更多美元的时候，他们煽起原子战争的恐怖。
    “原子武器的垄断”早已经不存在了，所谓“氢弹优势”现在也已经破产，而美国的统治者们却还是把自己的赌注压在这些已经失灵的法宝上。他们甚至纠合自己的北大西洋伙伴作出了准备原子战争的计划，并为此而不断地散布着所谓原子战争不可避免的恫吓论调。这难道不是说明，华盛顿的原子狂人和他们的跟班害怕承认他们在原子竞赛中已经失败，而仍旧希望用幻觉来支撑他们的威势么？
    但是，原子“实力政策”毕竟仍在推行。美国的原子武器拨款一年比一年增加，原子武器试验一次比一次扩大。为了发展原子武器的生产，这些年来美国政府已从老百姓的腰包里捞走了成百亿的美元。而带给人民的又是什么呢？在今天的美国，人们正在关于原子战争的歇斯底里中过着心神不宁的日子。新泽西州的孩子要捺下自己的指纹，说是为了便于在一旦遭到原子弹轰炸后辨明尸体！纽约州的教育局长给学生们增加了新的功课：要“像每天刷牙的习惯一样”进行防原子弹的演习。充斥在各种大报小报和广播、电视中的有关原子武器的疯狂叫嚣和人为恫吓，已经使纽约和芝加哥的居民们够提心吊胆和头昏脑胀的了。而事情还不止如此。为了扩建制造氢弹的工厂，美国的许多乡镇已被夷为平地，几千户农民被迫离弃了自己的家园。南卡罗来纳州的居民们这样问道：“很难理解，我们的乡镇为什么为了制造一枚摧毁别人的乡镇的炸弹而要被摧毁呢？……”
    遭殃的当然绝不只是美国的人民。在日本，广岛生还者的伤痕犹在，母亲们的眼泪未干，而今天不少人又成了美国试验氢弹的牺牲品。两千万以上的日本人民同声发出要求禁绝氢弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器的愤怒呼声，决不是没有原由的。
    对于西欧各国来说，情况也变得愈来愈危险了。邱吉尔之流抱住美国大腿当靠山，不惜把英伦三岛变成美国的原子航空母舰，容许美国可以把英国卷入原子战争的杀场。去年十二月北大西洋集团理事会会议以后，整个西欧在未来的战争中已处于首当其冲的地位。而西欧各国的部长先生却还在以各种各样的花言巧语来欺骗人民，要他们相信自己处境的安全。
    原子狂人们的活动已经严重威胁到了各国人民的安全。人们都发问：为什么非得如此呢？难道原子能不可以用于而且仅仅是用于为人类造福吗？
    当然不是的。每一个关心世界命运的人都能从苏联的正义主张和坚定行动中得到这样的答复。苏联从一开始就认为原子能必须为和平的目的服务，而不是为战争的目的服务。苏联的态度是始终如一的。当它还没有掌握原子武器的时候，它是这样；当它掌握了原子武器并且拥有肯定的优势时，它还是这样。当美国的原子科学家穿上了军装，在军事实验室里一心发展大规模杀人武器的时候，苏联的科学家们却在自己的实验室里为争取原子能早日造福人类而埋头工作着。当美国原子能委员会断言“我们看不出在二十年内，在最有利的条件下由原子核燃料为目前世界电力提供多大供应量”的时候，第一个原子电力站却在苏联开始发电了。苏联是从全世界人民的利益出发的。它不仅关怀着本国人民的安全和福利，同时也关怀着别国人民的安全和福利；不仅关怀着人类的今天，也关怀着人类的明天。在苏联看来：莫斯科的特列恰科夫陈列馆和巴黎的罗浮尔宫是同样应该加以保护的；重建的华沙不应该遭到另一次毁坏而应该在现代科学新发现的基础上建设得更为壮丽舒适，正如考文垂的居民没有理由在新的战争中再作无辜的牺牲而有权利要求把原子能用来为他们的福利服务一样。因此苏联不仅不认为原子能科学方面的成就应该为少数国家所垄断，而且十分愿意为了全人类的利益把它自己的研究成果公开出来。苏联政府已经宣布它决定给若干国家在和平利用原子能方面以技术科学上的帮助，就是具体的明证。
    今天在全世界人民的面前正呈现着和平利用原子能的非常广阔的远景。如果实现苏联的主张，把原子能完全用来为人类服务，那么人类得到的好处将是无可限量的。一七六九年英国机械师詹姆士·瓦特发明的蒸汽机，带来了生产的革命，而原子能的广泛应用，将使人类生活的面貌为之一新，开辟人类历史新的一章。人类将有可能在宽广得多的范围内运用自然的力量，并把自己的活动扩展到整个宇宙的空间中去。
    苏联的科学家早就指出：有了原子能，人们就能够更有条件去改造自然，能够在远离水源或煤田的任何地方得到电和热。不毛之地可以变作肥沃的良田，荒山僻野也能建成繁华的街市。有了原子能，人们将能够管理天气，征服高山和大海，使空间的距离大大缩短。原子能还可以疗治痼疾，延长人的生命；应用于各门科学，为人类打开新的境界。今天人们还只是谈论着到火星去的幻想，而将来的某一个时候，人们也许就会像一四九二年听取哥伦布发现新大陆的报告那样，怀着惊奇和激动的心情来听取第一批从火星上回来的科学家们报告他们旅行的观感了。
    自从有了蒸汽机以后，人类社会在一百多年内的进程超过了以往的几千年。原子能时代的到来，使落后国家的经济有可能在短得多的时期里迅速地推进到现代的发展水平。
    这一切美好的远景要求禁绝原子武器，把原子能完全用于和平的目的。道理很简单：大规模地和平利用原子能和大规模地发展原子武器是水火不能相容的。艾森豪威尔的虚伪的所谓“原子共储计划”之所以站不住脚也正在这里。为什么美国不同意立即销毁所有原子武器储藏，还在大量制造并且拚命鼓吹大规模毁灭性武器呢？只要原子武器还掌握在和平敌人的手里，世界和平的前景就不能不继续受到威胁，美好的建设仍有遭到破坏的可能。在广岛的受害者和得到原子电力供应的苏联工厂的工人之间，在灾难和幸福之间，人们是懂得选择什么的。任何花言巧语也欺骗不了他们，任何恫吓威胁也唬不了他们。人民要求的是：把全部原子能——无论是在实验室里还是在工厂里，无论是已经开发出来的还是尚未开发出来的——都拿来为人类造福。
    人民的愿望是一定会实现的。华尔街财阀想用原子弹来挽救日益腐败的资本主义制度，就像要使太阳从西边出来那样的枉费心机。科学发展的道路无论是多么的曲折艰难，归根到底它总是要为自己的创造者——人类服务的。这是自然和社会发展的客观规律，这是任何力量任何阻碍所不可阻挡的。亿万人民的力量一定能够制伏抱着原子弹不肯放的人，原子能完全为人类的幸福服务的一天是一定会到来的。
