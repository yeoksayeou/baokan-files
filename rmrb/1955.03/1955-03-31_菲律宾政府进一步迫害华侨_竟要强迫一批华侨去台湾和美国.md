Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Philippine President Magsaysay ordered at a cabinet meeting on February 23rd the forced repatriation of 2,400 so-called "overstaying Chinese travelers" to Taiwan. Furthermore, according to a Manila dispatch on March 2nd: Philippine Immigration Bureau Deputy Director Lira Larosa declared earlier that these so-called "overstaying Chinese travelers" would be sent to the United States as foreign refugees.

These 2,400 Overseas Chinese all went to the Philippines with legal procedures, but the Philippine government has treated them with extremely unreasonable methods. In addition to demanding a security deposit of 10,000 Philippine pesos per person, a monthly extension fee of 10 pesos, and 50 pesos per certificate, they often fabricate charges, conduct secret trials, and arbitrarily carry out threats and extortions. Now, the Philippine government is attempting to forcibly send them to Taiwan and the United States, subjecting them to the enslavement and persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and American imperialism. This is a further conspiracy and crime by the Philippine government to persecute Overseas Chinese, after being instigated by American imperialism to issue the so-called "Retail Nationalization Act" to persecute Overseas Chinese. The Chinese people are paying serious attention to this.

    菲律宾政府进一步迫害华侨
    竟要强迫一批华侨去台湾和美国
    新华社讯　菲律宾总统麦格赛赛于二月二十三日在内阁会议上命令把二千四百名所谓“逾期华侨旅客”强迫遣送台湾。又据马尼拉三月二日消息：菲律宾移民局副局长黎拉罗沙早些时候宣称要把所谓“逾期华侨旅客”作为外侨难民遣送往美国。
    这二千四百名华侨都是以合法的手续去菲律宾的，可是菲律宾政府竟采取极不合理的手段对待他们，除向他们索取担保金每人菲币一万元，常月展期费十元和证书每张五十元外，还经常捏造罪名，将他们秘密审讯，并肆意进行威胁、勒索。现在菲律宾政府竟又要强迫遣送他们去台湾和美国，使他们受蒋介石卖国集团及美帝国主义的奴役、迫害，这是菲律宾政府在它受美帝国主义嗾使颁行所谓“零售商菲化法案”以迫害华侨之后，更进一步迫害华侨的阴谋罪行。对此，中国人民正予以严重注意。
