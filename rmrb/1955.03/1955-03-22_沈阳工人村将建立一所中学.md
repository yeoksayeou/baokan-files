According to the development of the Workers' Village in the city, the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee Education Bureau has decided to build a middle school in the Workers' Village this year, following the construction of a Workers' Village primary school in 1954.

The site for the Workers' Village Middle School has been selected, only 300 meters away from the Workers' Village tram line. The Shenyang No. 3 Engineering Company, which is undertaking the construction, is actively working with the construction units to prepare for various construction tasks. It is expected to officially start construction around April 20th and be completed in mid-August, so that it can be used when school starts in the fall.

The Workers' Village Middle School is designed as a 24-class urban standard middle school, a three-story building with an area of more than 4,500 square meters. This building will have 24 ordinary classrooms, as well as four larger specialized classrooms. The chemistry, physics, and biology classrooms will have corresponding advanced teaching equipment, and will be equipped with instrument preparation rooms. In addition to this, there will be spacious library reading rooms, etc. Calculated on the basis of two-part teaching, this middle school can accommodate about 2,000 students.

    沈阳工人村将建立一所中学
    沈阳市人民委员会教育局根据市内工人村发展的情况，决定继一九五四年新建一所工人村小学之后，今年在工人村再新建一所中学。
    这所工人村中学的地址已选定，距工人村电车路仅三百多公尺。承修的沈阳市第三工程公司正积极会同建筑单位进行各项施工准备工作，预计在今年四月二十日左右正式开工，八月中旬完工，秋季开学时即可使用。
    工人村中学是采用二十四班的城市标准中学设计，为三层大楼，面积为四千五百多平方公尺。这一建筑将有二十四个普通教室，还有四个较大的专用教室，在化学、物理和生物教室中，都有相应的先进教学设备，并附有仪器准备室。这以外还有宽敞的图书阅览室等。按照二部教学计算，这所中学共可容纳学生两千名左右。
