Farmers in the vast areas of Hunan Province, including the Dongting Lake area, southern Hunan, and western Hunan, are actively engaged in spring activities such as accumulating fertilizer, changing seeds, plowing fields, adjusting draft cattle, and preparing rice seedling fields. At present, the countryside is bustling with activity everywhere.

The large-scale seven-thousand-li levee repair project in the Dongting Lake area is nearing completion. Counties in the lake area successively shifted to spring plowing production from late February to early March. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in counties such as Li County and Hanshou County generally reaches about 50 dan per mu. The farmers, seeing the newly repaired dikes, have further increased their production enthusiasm and confidence in striving for a bumper harvest. Some farmers are using loans and money earned from fishing to purchase additional draft cattle and repair or make new farm tools, in order to make various preparations for the rapid resumption of production. At the same time, more than 300,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in hilly and mountainous areas that were destroyed by mountain floods have been largely repaired, and the work of restoring disaster-stricken fields has begun.

In order to help farmers smoothly complete this year's production tasks, 61 million yuan of agricultural loans throughout the province have been distributed to counties and townships in a timely manner. The Provincial Finance Committee has also established a draft cattle adjustment office and is purchasing draft cattle for disaster areas from both inside and outside the province. More than 5,000 heads of draft cattle purchased within the province are being shipped out.

    湖南各地农民积极准备春耕
    湖南省洞庭湖滨和湘南、湘西广大地区的农民正积极进行春季积肥、换种、翻田、调剂耕牛、整理秧田等工作。目前，农村到处呈现了一片繁忙景象。
    洞庭湖区规模巨大的七千里堤线的整修工程接近全面完工，湖区各县在二月底到三月初已先后转入春耕生产工作，澧县、汉寿等县所积的肥料一般每亩已达五十担左右。农民们看到了新修的堤垸，更加提高了生产积极性和争取丰收的信心。有的农民正在用贷款和捕鱼所得的钱添购耕牛，修整、添制农具，为迅速恢复生产作好各种准备。同时，丘陵区和山区三十多万处被山洪冲毁的小型农田水利工程，也大体整修完竣，转入灾田恢复工作。
    为了帮助农民顺利完成今年生产任务，全省六千一百万元农贷早已及时分配到县、乡。省财委会还设立了耕牛调剂办公室，并向省内、外为灾区采购耕牛。在省内购买的五千多头耕牛正源源起运。
