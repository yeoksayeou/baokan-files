    U.S. Intensifies Plan for Economic Aggression Against Asia
    Stassen Conducts Activities in Southeast Asia
    [New China News Agency, March 7th] U.S. Foreign Operations Administration Director Harold Stassen concluded his activities in Southeast Asian countries on the 7th and traveled from Manila to Seoul, South Korea, to conduct activities.
    After attending the Manila Treaty Organization meeting in Bangkok, Stassen visited India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and the Philippines to discuss the so-called new "aid" plan formulated by the United States for Asian countries with the leaders of these countries. Sources revealed that the purpose of Stassen's visit was to gauge the views of these countries' governments on the United States' so-called new plan.
    According to Agence France-Presse, citing sources in London, Stassen is trying his best to include two components in this plan. One component is to establish a permanent secretariat in Southeast Asian countries to be "responsible for allocating foreign aid." This means that the United States is attempting to directly control the use of U.S. aid through such an agency, strengthening its interference in the internal affairs of recipient countries. The news stated that Stassen openly interfered in Ceylon's internal affairs at a press conference in Colombo by relying on U.S. "aid." Stassen said that Ceylon's trade relations with China, based on equality and mutual benefit, were something the United States "disliked" and that the U.S. government "had to study."
    Another component of Stassen's plan is to "further integrate Japan into the Southeast Asian economic system." The United States is attempting to use Japanese economic power through this plan to seize Southeast Asian markets and squeeze out the traditional economic influence of Britain and France.
    The U.S. plan to intensify economic aggression against Asia has caused unease in Britain. Agence France-Presse reporter Béarmi reported from London that "Britain is very lukewarm to Stassen's plan because it may conflict with the Colombo Plan." The reporter pointed out that the U.S. attempt to establish a permanent institution in Southeast Asia and to allow Japanese economic forces to infiltrate Southeast Asia are both "inconsistent with British policy." The reporter said that London "is worried that the establishment of a permanent secretariat controlled by the United States will change the sympathy of some Southeast Asian countries towards Britain, which will be a threat to the Colombo Plan." At the same time, London is also afraid that the "infiltration of Japanese technology will increase Japan's power in Southeast Asia and damage British interests."

### 美国加强对亚洲的经济侵略计划  史塔生在东南亚进行活动

     美国加强对亚洲的经济侵略计划
     史塔生在东南亚进行活动
    【新华社七日讯】美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在七日结束了在东南亚国家的活动，并从马尼拉去到南朝鲜的汉城进行活动。
    史塔生在参加马尼拉条约国家曼谷会议以后，曾去印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、菲律宾各国，同这些国家的领袖讨论了美国拟订的对亚洲国家的所谓新的“援助”计划。消息透露：史塔生这次访问的目的，是要试探这些国家的政府对美国的这个所谓新计划的看法。
    据法新社援引伦敦人士的话说，史塔生竭力设法在这个计划中包括两个内容。一个内容是在东南亚国家建立一个常设秘书处，以“负责分配对外援助”。这就是说，美国企图通过这样一个机构，来直接控制美国援助的使用，加强对受援国家内政的干涉。消息说，史塔生在科伦坡举行的记者招待会上就曾凭借美国“援助”公然干涉锡兰的内政。史塔生说，锡兰和中国之间的以平等、互利为基础的贸易关系是美国所“不喜欢”的，而且是美国政府所“不得不研究的问题”。
    史塔生计划中的另一个内容是要“使日本更进一步参加东南亚的经济体系”。美国企图通过这个计划利用日本经济势力来夺取东南亚市场，排挤英法的传统经济势力。
    美国这个加强对亚洲经济侵略的计划，引起了英国的不安。法新社记者贝阿密发自伦敦的消息说，“英国对史塔生的计划很冷淡，因为它可能同科伦坡计划发生冲突。”这个记者指出，美国企图在东南亚设立常设机构，并且使日本经济势力渗入东南亚都是“不符合英国的政策的”。这个记者说，伦敦方面“担心成立一个为美国所控制的常设秘书处会改变某些东南亚国家对英国的同情，这对科伦坡计划将是一个威胁”。同时，伦敦方面又害怕日本“技术的渗入将增加日本在东南亚的势力而损害英国的利益”。
