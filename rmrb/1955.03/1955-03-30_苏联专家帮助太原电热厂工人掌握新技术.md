Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 29th: At the newly built Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant, equipped with advanced Soviet technology, Soviet experts are guiding Chinese workers every day to master new technologies. The Soviet experts, who are guiding the installation of new equipment, also constantly provide valuable suggestions to the power plant's operating personnel. Since March, Soviet experts have provided more than 140 suggestions related to operation in the turbine, boiler, electrical, and chemical divisions alone.

In September 1954, when this heating and power plant completed the first phase of its construction project with the help of Soviet experts and installed part of the equipment, Soviet experts who would guide the operation of the power plant arrived one after another. They explained the performance and operating principles of the equipment to the workers, personally demonstrated the operation, and also helped the heating and power plant formulate operating procedures and management systems. As a result, the workers' operating skills improved rapidly. At the beginning of operation, the workers in the boiler division often experienced accidents such as "flameouts" and "gunshots" because they could not master the air supply and coal feed. Later, with the help of Soviet experts, the workers learned how to operate the equipment, and by March, this phenomenon had been basically eliminated. In more than five months, Soviet expert Mikhailov gave more than 260 suggestions to the chemical division, teaching the workers every detail, from operating principles and methods to the style of laboratory tables and interior layout. Workers who had no experience in treating chemical water have now basically mastered these technologies.

In order to better learn operating techniques from Soviet experts, the workers of the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant recently reviewed the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions and formulated various systems for the registration, implementation, and inspection of Soviet experts' suggestions.

    苏联专家帮助太原电热厂工人掌握新技术
    【新华社太原二十九日电】在新建的用苏联先进技术装备起来的太原电热厂里，苏联专家每天都在亲切地指导我国工人掌握新的技术。正在指导安装新设备的苏联专家，也不时地给电厂运行人员提出各种宝贵的建议。从三月份以来，仅汽机、锅炉、电气和化学四个分场，苏联专家提出的有关运行的建议就有一百四十多条。
    一九五四年九月，当这个电热厂在苏联专家帮助下完成第一期建筑工程并安装起一部分设备时，指导电厂运行的苏联专家就陆续地来了。他们向工人讲解设备的性能和运行原理，亲自操作给工人看，还帮助电热厂制订运行规程和管理制度。因此工人的运行技术提高很快。锅炉分场的工人们在开始操作时因为掌握不了送风量和给煤量，常常发生“灭火”“打枪”等事故，后来工人们在苏联专家帮助下学会了操作，到三月份这种现象就基本上消灭了。苏联专家米哈依诺夫在五个多月中曾给化学分场提出过二百六十多条建议，从操作原理和方法到试验室桌子的样式和室内布置等，都一点一滴地教给工人们。从来没有处理化学水经验的工人现在也基本上掌握了这些技术。
    太原电热厂的工人为了更好地向苏联专家学习运行技术，最近曾检查了贯彻苏联专家建议的情况，并订出各种关于苏联专家建议的登记、执行和检查的制度。
