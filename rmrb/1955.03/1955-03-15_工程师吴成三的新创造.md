    Engineer Wu Chengshan, an engineer working on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, has made new innovations in railway bridge construction engineering by studying advanced Soviet technology. Wu Chengshan once suggested that bridges could be built on sandy gravel foundations without piling. This time, he suggested using soil replacement to increase the soil bearing capacity when building bridges on soft soil, humus soil, backfill soil, and other soils with insufficient bearing capacity. This would also eliminate the need for piling. After testing, it was proven that replacing the soil with low bearing capacity under the bridge foundation with permeable soil with high bearing capacity could achieve a bearing capacity of 45 to 60 tons per square meter, which is more than twice the bearing capacity of wood piles.
    More than 20 reinforced concrete bridges, stone arch bridges, and large bridge abutments on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have adopted his new suggestion. Among them, simply by changing the southern abutment of the Jialing River No. 1 Bridge to the soil replacement method, the state saved 30,000 yuan worth of reinforced concrete piles and shortened the construction period by one month.
    In early March of this year, Wu Chengshan was rated as an A-level labor model for the second time because of this. Wu Chengshan's suggestion has aroused widespread interest in China's engineering community. From last year to this year, Wu Chengshan has frequently received letters from all over the country and has introduced his experience in construction and transportation departments in Chengdu, Beijing, Harbin, and other places.

    工程师吴成三的新创造
    宝成铁路南段工程师吴成三学习苏联先进技术，在铁路桥梁建筑工程方面又有新创造。吴成三曾经建议在沙夹卵石的基础上修桥可以不打桩。这次他又建议在软质土壤、腐植土、回填土等承载力不够的土壤基础上修桥时，采用更换土壤的办法来增强土壤承载力。这样仍然可以不打桩。这个办法经过试验，证明将桥基底下的承载力小的土壤更换为承载力大的渗水土壤，每平方公尺的承载力可以达到四十五吨到六十吨，比打木桩的承载力高一倍以上。
    宝成铁路南段已有二十多座钢筋混凝土桥梁、石拱桥和大桥桥台采用了他的新建议，其中仅嘉陵江一号大桥南桥台改用更换土壤的办法后，就为国家节省了价值三万元的钢筋混凝土桩，并且提前工期一个月。
    今年三月初，吴成三因此第二次被评为甲等劳动模范。吴成三的建议已引起我国工程界广泛的兴趣。从去年到今年，吴成三经常收到祖国各地的来信，并先后在成都、北京、哈尔滨等地的建筑交通部门介绍经验。
