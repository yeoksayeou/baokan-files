   Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: According to TASS on the 25th, the Beirut newspaper "Today" quoted well-informed sources as saying that a Turkish patrol crossed the Syrian border and fired on Syrian border posts. After being repelled, the patrol retreated back into Turkish territory.
    The report said that the strength of Turkish troops in the Gaziantep area had quadrupled in the past month. The "Al-Ahram" correspondent in Damascus pointed out that the concentration of Turkish troops on the Syrian border is directly related to the Turkish government's attempt to force Syria to join the Turkish-Iraqi pact, which is pursuing American policy, and this practice is the first step in threatening the territorial integrity and national independence of the Syrian Republic.
    Foreign newspapers have pointed out more than once that the Turkish and Iraqi governments agreed to divide Syria when signing the Turkish-Iraqi pact. Turkey intends to annex the Aleppo region, while the rest of Syria is planned to be incorporated into the planned "Syrian-Iraqi Federation."
    According to well-informed sources in Cairo, these plans of aggression were formulated as a result of collusion between the United States and Britain. The United States promised not to obstruct Iraq's annexation of most of Syria's territory in exchange for British support for the Turkish-Iraqi pact.
    It is reported that recently, the United States and Britain have rejected the Syrian government's request for a guarantee of the inviolability of Syrian territory within its current borders. Disregarding the declaration jointly issued by them and France in May 1950 on maintaining the status quo in the Near East, the United States and Britain refused to provide such guarantees.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus: The Syrian government intends to raise the issue of Turkey's unprecedented policy of threats and pressure against Syria to the United Nations Security Council. Syrian Foreign Minister Azem met with the heads of foreign diplomatic missions in Syria on the 23rd and 24th to discuss the issue of Turkish-Syrian relations.
    According to Agence France-Presse, the Iraqi government has decided to act as a "mediator" between Turkey and Syria, although Syria has not requested such "mediation." Reports say that Iraq's insistence on "mediating" is an attempt to put pressure on the Syrian government, particularly to force it to reconsider its attitude towards the Turkish-Iraqi pact.
    An Egyptian government spokesman said on March 24: "Egypt will support Syria to the end, and any aggression against Syria's territory and integrity will be considered an aggression against Egypt and the Egyptian people."
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The provocative policies adopted by the Turkish government towards Syria have aroused opposition from the public and public opinion in Lebanon and Egypt.
    It is reported that Lebanese Prime Minister Saeb Salam told the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires in Lebanon on March 23 that the Lebanese government did not approve of Turkey's threats against Syria. He also said that if Turkish politicians and newspapers do not stop issuing threats to Syria, Lebanese President Camille Chamoun may postpone his visit to Turkey.
    The Lebanese "Daily Star" said, "Menderes would never dare to carry out the actions he is now taking against Syria without the support of the United States and Britain."
    The Egyptian "Al-Gomhuria" published an editorial stating that the threats and intimidation carried out by imperialist countries and Turkey "will not stop the people of Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries from resisting the Turkish-Iraqi pact or any other military treaty."

    土耳其在土叙边境集结军队并一度侵入叙利亚领土
    埃及等国公众一致斥责土耳其的威胁政策
   【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社二十五日讯：贝鲁特报纸“今天报”援引消息灵通人士的消息说，一个土耳其的巡逻队越过了叙利亚边境，并向叙利亚的边防岗哨开枪。在遭到了回击后，这个巡逻队已撤退到土耳其境内。
    消息说，在过去的一个月中，在加西恩塔普地区的土耳其军队实力增加了四倍。埃及“金字塔报”驻大马士革记者指出，土耳其军队向叙利亚边境集结是和奉行美国政策的土耳其政府想强迫叙利亚参加土耳其—伊拉克条约的企图直接有关的，而这种做法是威胁叙利亚共和国领土完整和国家独立的第一步。
    外国报纸不止一次地指出，土耳其和伊拉克政府在签订土耳其—伊拉克条约时曾约定要分割叙利亚。土耳其打算吞并阿勒颇区，而叙利亚的其余领土则打算划入计划中的“叙利亚—伊拉克联邦”。
    据开罗消息灵通人士说，这些侵略计划是由于美、英的串通而制定的。美国答应不阻挠伊拉克吞并叙利亚的大部分领土以换得英国对土耳其—伊拉克条约的支持。
    据悉，不久前，美国和英国已拒绝叙利亚政府关于保障叙利亚现在版图以内领土的不可侵犯性的要求。美国和英国不顾一九五零年五月它们和法国所共同发表的关于维护近东现状的宣言，拒绝提供这种保障。
    据新华社讯：大马士革消息说，叙利亚政府打算向联合国安全理事会提出土耳其对叙利亚执行的史无前例的威胁和压力政策的问题。叙利亚外交部长阿泽姆在二十三日和二十四日曾经和驻叙利亚的各国外交代表会面，同他们讨论了土耳其和叙利亚的关系问题。
    据法新社报道，伊拉克政府已决定充当土耳其和叙利亚之间的“调停人”，虽然叙利亚并没有要求进行这样的“调停”。有消息说，伊拉克硬要出来“调停”，是企图对叙利亚政府施加压力，特别是迫使它重新考虑它对土耳其—伊拉克条约的态度。
    埃及政府发言人三月二十四日说：“埃及将支持叙利亚到底，对叙利亚的领土与完整进行的任何侵略，势将被认为是对埃及和埃及人民进行的侵略。”
    据新华社讯：土耳其政府采取的对叙利亚的挑衅性政策引起黎巴嫩和埃及公众和舆论的反对。
    据悉，黎巴嫩总理索勒哈在三月二十三日接见土耳其驻黎巴嫩临时代办时对他说，黎巴嫩政府不赞成土耳其对叙利亚的威胁。他又说，如果土耳其的政界人物和报纸不停止对叙利亚发出威胁的话，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙可能暂不访问土耳其。
    黎巴嫩“日报”说，“没有美国和英国的支持，曼德列斯绝不敢进行他现在对叙利亚所采取的行动。”
    埃及“共和国报”发表社论说，帝国主义国家和土耳其所进行的威胁和恫吓，“是不会使埃及、叙利亚以及其他阿拉伯国家的人民对土耳其—伊拉克条约或任何其他军事条约停止抵抗的”。
