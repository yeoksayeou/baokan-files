Editor's Note: Construction preparation work is an important issue that all construction units, construction enterprises, and local Party committees should pay attention to. This article is excerpted from the construction preparation work summary of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction by the construction engineering department directly subordinate engineering company. The experiences and lessons discussed here can be used as a reference for various engineering units and relevant departments.
    
    Insufficient Construction Preparation Inevitably Leads to Chaos and Waste
    The construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was organized under the circumstances of simultaneous design and preparation, and construction started as soon as the drawings arrived. When we started construction preparation in the first quarter of 1953, our strength was relatively weak and we lacked experience. We didn't even know what construction organization design and construction general layout plan were. We only saw from the "conditional design" drafted by the Soviet Design Institute that several processing plants and construction machinery were needed during the construction of the plant. Then we began to design the processing plant buildings, formulate the list of required machinery and equipment, and arrange on-site measurement and temporary facilities. However, due to lack of experience and necessary data for planning and design, the so-called design was just blind estimation and hasty arrangements, drawing some rough sketches of buildings. In March and April, we started building processing plants, workers' dormitories and other temporary facilities based on these sketches. On July 1, the foundation engineering of the carpentry workshop started. At that time, the Soviet experts who helped us with the construction had not yet arrived, and we did not understand the content of the factory building structure. Although the formal factory building had started construction, the auxiliary enterprises had not yet been organized, and processed products were made and used as needed. On the site, on one hand, work was stopped waiting for materials, and on the other hand, overtime work was done to rush the work. Everyone was busy dealing with on-site affairs, and could not take care of planning and design and the next step of preparation work, or improving business management and efficiency.
    
    Due to the rush in preparation time, it only took a few months from gathering construction forces to starting the construction of the factory building. The preparation work was stuck in asking for people, machines, and setting up stalls. The organizational construction and ideological construction of the construction team could not be taken care of, and scientific planning and design of the project was out of the question. Although we made up for the lesson at the beginning of 1954 and compiled the construction organization design and construction general layout plan, the planning and design still had many shortcomings and errors, and we fell into busy and passive after the start of construction.
    
    By the second and third quarters of 1954, we strengthened the planning management work, which reversed the chaotic situation. However, due to the arrival of drawings and lack of sufficient research and preparation, the situation of uneven construction and rushing work could not be fundamentally changed.
    
    Although the construction plans for the past two years have been overfulfilled, and we have accumulated certain experiences and formed a strong construction force, the waste caused by insufficient construction preparation and passively coping with rushing work is incalculable.
    
    First of all, due to the lack of reliable data and plans, blind preparation caused material backlog and idleness. At the end of 1953, the stagnant materials were worth a total of 3.39 million yuan in new currency, including more than 2,000 tons of steel and 110 ventilators. The total idleness for the year reached 350,000 workdays, including more than 500 crane workers, who were idle for more than half a year. Although there was an improvement in 1954, there were still stagnant materials worth more than 2 million yuan in new currency at the end of the year, and 390,000 workdays of idleness in various work areas and processing plants.
    
    Secondly, due to rushing work, drawings arrived and construction started, construction was extremely uneven, resulting in a large number of personnel, huge miscellaneous expenses, low production efficiency, and low equipment utilization. During the rush work, each work area shouted that there was a shortage of labor (up to 30,000 workers at most), and a large amount of idleness occurred in winter. The metal structure factory had an output of more than 1,000 tons in September, and there were no tasks after December. The same is true for the utilization rate of machinery. The whole company had 31 cranes of various sizes. The third quarter was not enough, and the daily utilization rate in the second quarter was only 35.3%. There was even more idleness in the first and fourth quarters. From the perspective of the work area, imbalance is an even more serious problem. When rushing the foundation engineering of the motorcycle factory in April and May, in addition to normal attendance, there were an additional 775 workdays of overtime. However, in June and July, due to the non-arrival of drawings, all work had to be stopped. Moreover, due to rushing work, frequent changes in labor organization, and disconnection of supply work, the implementation of assembly line operations was hindered, labor efficiency was very low, and tools and materials could not be used in rotation.
    
    Third, due to the lack of correct and detailed planning and design, waste of temporary facilities was caused, and the layout of auxiliary enterprise sites, transportation, roads, water and electricity lines, etc. was not good, affecting construction. The cost of temporary facilities accounted for 17% of the total cost. The factories, warehouses, water and electricity, roads, etc. required for construction were all built separately. Moreover, due to the errors in planning and design, these temporary facilities also caused great losses. The area of the processing plant was expanded from more than 8,000 square meters to more than 30,000 square meters, and the process layout was naturally unreasonable. Some temporary facilities were placed in improper positions, and were often forced to be demolished and relocated during the peak construction period, delaying construction. The first mixing station was moved twice during the construction period. The high-voltage line was moved back and forth 28 times. The main water pipe was moved 14 times.
    
    Fourth, due to being busy and chaotic, and due to the lack of in-depth organizational work, technical level and enterprise management level could not be improved, resulting in more accidents and higher costs. In 1953, the formal project was still all time-based wages, and the efficiency was far behind the state-stipulated quotas. The advanced systems of "research and review of drawings," "sectional engineering construction organization design," and "construction budget," which have been repeatedly advocated in the past two years, have not been well implemented. These tasks often lag behind the construction due to hasty commencement, and cannot play a guiding and controlling role.
    
    Recalling and analyzing the situation at that time, the most important reason for the above-mentioned serious chaos and waste is that we underestimated the complexity and arduousness of such a large-scale industrial construction project, and underestimated the importance of construction preparation work. Although we saw the difficulties and generally emphasized doing a good job in construction preparation, the guiding ideology was adventurous, eager to complete the task, and demanding it to be as fast as possible. Although many of the technical personnel had more construction experience, they also lacked understanding of large-scale industrial construction, thinking that the difference from past projects was only in quantity, and that Soviet design and mechanized construction were only certain technical innovations; they believed that there was not much to do in construction preparation work and planning and design, so they ignored the collection of data and the learning and research of planning and design, and hastily decided based on old experiences. Later, due to the eagerness to start construction, construction measurement, water, electricity, transportation, site layout, etc. all accommodated the reality and dealt with the present, which in turn caused difficulties in the future.
    
    Checking from the planning work, the main reason for the chaotic and wasteful phenomenon in construction is the lack of a correct and comprehensive master schedule. The plans that have been formulated are often not based on the actual conditions of design data, materials, equipment, and construction forces, but are formulated solely based on subjective wishes, and have to be repeatedly modified during execution. The annual plan for 1953 was changed four times. The plan indicators formulated at the beginning of the year were very adventurous, preparing to complete the shell of the first phase of five factory buildings. Construction started in April, and hoisting began in June, hurriedly recruiting crane workers and panicking. The annual plan for 1954 was also changed four times. The first time it was required to complete 61.9% of the entire plant construction plan, and the second time it was reduced to 33% of the original plan. Due to the adventurous and changeable plans, unnecessary tension and unnecessary rush work were caused, and thus blind procurement and backlog were also caused.
    
    Insufficient contact with the design department and not understanding the design content and the delivery of drawings in advance, so that the work could not be deployed early with a clear understanding, is also a cause of chaos and waste. We rarely carefully considered how to require the design department to put forward drawings in combination with construction needs. In the spring of 1953, we not only did not know the specific design progress, but also did not know that the construction drawings were delivered in batches; we did not know anything about the structural style content, quality requirements, prefabricated components, the types and specifications of main materials, and other new technical issues, so there was a lack of basis in processing plant design, material preparation, and schedule arrangement.
    
    In addition, failing to seriously study the existing Soviet design data and the construction experience of fraternal units is also an important reason for construction chaos and waste. At the beginning of 1953, we had preliminary designs, conditional designs, and technical designs for five factory buildings. Although there were many discrepancies between these data and the actual construction drawings later, we could still get a general concept of the main forms and contents of the building structure, pipeline layout, and main process requirements. Many items and planning opinions put forward in the conditional design are still very enlightening to us today. The construction sites of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant also have many experiences that can help us improve our work. However, in the past, we were only busy starting construction and relaxed the collection and research of these important data and the study of existing experiences; and these researches and studies are precisely the necessary steps for correctly carrying out construction preparation.
    
    Based on the experience and lessons of the past two years, we have deeply realized that industrial construction is a complex and scientific work, and construction preparation work must be valued. The quality of construction engineering preparation determines the quality of construction engineering: good, fast, economical, and safe. Doing a good job in preparation work is equivalent to doing more than half of the project. Without sufficient preparation work, starting construction hastily will only cause waste and will not speed up the progress. The main links of preparation work are to correctly formulate a schedule plan, and seriously carry out construction organization design and general layout plan.

### 施工准备不足必然造成混乱和浪费

专栏：

    编者按：施工准备工作是各个建设单位、建筑企业及各地党委都应注意的一个重要问题。这篇文章是从建筑工程部直属工程公司建设第一汽车制造厂施工准备工作总结中摘编的，这里面所谈的一些经验教训，可供各工程单位及有关部门的参考。
    施工准备不足必然造成混乱和浪费
    第一汽车制造厂的建设工程，是在边设计边准备，图纸随到随开工的情况下组织施工的。一九五三年第一季度开始施工准备时，我们的力量比较薄弱，经验很缺乏，还不懂得什么叫施工组织设计和施工总平面图。我们只从苏联设计院拟订的“条件设计”中看到建厂时需有若干加工厂和施工机具，就开始设计加工厂厂房，拟订需要的机器设备的清单，布置现场测量及暂设工程，但由于缺乏经验，又缺乏规划设计的必要资料，所谓设计，只是盲目估计，草率安排，画一些建筑物的草图而已。三、四月间，就根据这些草图建设加工厂，工人宿舍及其他暂设工程。七月一日，木工工场基础工程就开工了。当时帮助我们施工的苏联专家尚未到达，我们对厂房结构的内容还不了解，正式厂房虽已开工，附属企业还没有组织就绪，加工品随做随用。现场上一面是停工待料，一面是加班加点，突击赶工。大家忙乱于应付现场的事务，对于规划设计和下一步的准备工作，对于改善经营管理和提高效率都无法顾及了。
    由于准备时间仓促，从集结施工力量到厂房开工，只有几个月。准备工作陷在要人、要机器和安摊子里，施工队伍的组织建设和思想建设无法顾及，工程上科学的规划设计更谈不上。一九五四年初虽然补了课，编制了施工组织设计及施工总平面图，但规划设计仍有许多缺点和错误，开工后就陷入忙乱被动。
    到了一九五四年的二、三季度，我们加强了计划管理工作，才扭转了混乱现象，但由于图纸随到随开工和缺乏足够的研究准备，施工不均衡，赶工突击的情况仍不能根本改变。
    两年来的建设计划虽然都超额完成了，并且积累了一定的经验，组成了强大的施工力量，但由于施工准备不足，被动应付突击赶工所造成的浪费也是不可计算的。
    首先，由于缺乏可靠的资料和计划，盲目准备，造成了材料积压和窝工现象。一九五三年年底的呆滞材料共值新币三百三十九万元，其中钢材就有二千多吨，通风机有一百一十台，全年窝工达三十五万工日，其中有起重机工五百余人，整整窝工半年以上。一九五四年虽有好转，但到年底仍有呆滞材料值新币二百多万元，各工区，各加工厂窝工三十九万工日。
    其次，由于突击赶工，图纸随到随开工，施工极不均衡，造成人员众多，杂费浩大，生产效率低，设备利用率低。在赶工时，各工区天天嚷劳动力不足（最多时有三万工人），到冬季就大量窝工。金属结构厂九月份产量一千余吨，十二月后就没有任务。机械使用率也是如此，全公司大小吊车三十一台，第三季度不够用，第二季度台日利用率仅百分之三十五点三，一、四季度更大量窝工。从工区来看，不均衡更是一个严重的问题。摩托工场四、五月间突击基础工程时，除正常出勤外，另外加班加点七百七十五个工日，而六、七月份，由于图纸未到，不得不全部停工。而且由于突击赶工，劳动组织多变，供应工作脱节，障碍了实行流水作业，劳动效率很低，工具材料无法周转使用。
    第三，由于没有正确细致的规划设计，造成暂设工程的浪费，附属企业场地位置、交通、道路、水电线路等的布置不善，影响施工。暂设工程费用占总造价的百分之十七，施工中所需要的厂房、仓库、水电、道路等全部都是另外建造的，而且由于规划设计的错误，这些暂设工程也造成很大的损失。加工厂的面积从八千多平方公尺扩充到三万多平方公尺，工艺布置自然不能合理。有的暂设工程放的位置不妥当，往往在施工紧张期间被逼拆迁，耽误施工。第一搅拌台在施工期内搬了两次。高压线前后改移二十八次。上水干管改移十四次。
    第四、由于忙和乱，由于缺乏深入的组织工作，技术水平和企业管理水平不能提高，以致事故多，成本高。一九五三年正式工程上还全部是计时工资，效率远远落后于国家规定的定额。两年来一再提倡的“研究和会审图纸”、“分部工程施工组织设计”、“施工预算”等先进制度，都没有很好贯彻。这些工作往往因仓促开工，落在施工后面，起不了指导和控制的作用。
    回忆和分析当时的情况，所以造成上述严重的混乱和浪费，其最主要原因，在于我们对这样一个规模巨大的工业建设工程的复杂性、艰巨性估计不足，对施工准备工作的重要性认识不足。我们虽然看到困难，也一般地强调作好施工准备，但主导思想是冒进的，急于完成任务，要求越快越好。技术人员中虽有不少人有较多的施工经验，但对大规模的工业建设也缺乏认识，以为跟过去的工程只是数量上的差异，苏联设计和机械化施工也只是技术上的某些革新；认为施工准备工作和规划设计并没有很多可做的事情，因而忽视资料的搜集和规划设计的学习研究，只根据老经验草率确定。其后又因急于开工，施工测量，水、电、交通、场地布置等都迁就现实，应付目前，反造成以后的困难。
    从计划工作来检查，造成施工中的混乱和浪费现象的主要原因，是缺乏正确的全面的总进度计划。已制定的计划往往也不是根据设计资料、材料、设备、施工力量的实际条件，而是单凭主观愿望制定的，执行中不得不屡次修改。一九五三年年度计划变更四次，年初制定的计划指标非常冒进，准备完成第一期五个厂房工程的外壳，四月份开工，六月份就开始装吊，急忙招请起重工，慌乱不堪。一九五四年的年度计划也曾变更四次，第一次要求完成全部建厂计划的百分之六十一点九，第二次削减至原计划的百分之三十三。由于计划冒进多变，因而造成不必要的紧张，不必要的突击抢工，也因而造成盲目的采购和积压。
    同设计部门联系不够，事先不了解设计内容及图纸交付情况，因此不能心中有数地及早部署工作，也是造成混乱和浪费的原因。我们很少周密地考虑如何要求设计部门结合施工需要提出图纸。一九五三年春天，我们不但不知道具体的设计进度，而且也不知道施工图纸是分批交付的；对于结构型式内容，质量要求，预制构件，主要材料的种类规格，以及其他新的技术问题更不了解，因此在加工厂设计，材料准备，进度安排方面都缺乏依据。
    此外，没有认真地学习已有的苏联设计资料和兄弟单位的施工经验，也是造成施工混乱和浪费的重要原因。一九五三年初，我们已有了初步设计，条件设计及五个厂房的技术设计，虽然这些资料和以后的实际施工图有不少出入，但对于建筑结构的主要形式内容，管线布置以及工艺上的主要要求，是可以得出一个总的概念的。条件设计中提出的许多项目和规划意见，到今天对我们仍有很大的启示。鞍山钢铁公司和哈尔滨量具刃具厂等建筑工地，也有许多经验是可以帮助我们改进工作的。但过去我们只忙于开工，放松了对这些重要资料的搜集研究和已有经验的学习；而这些研究和学习，正是正确地进行施工准备所必需的步骤。
    根据两年来的经验教训，我们深深地体会到工业建设是一项复杂的，科学的工作，必须重视施工准备工作。建筑工程的好、快、省、安全取决于准备工作的质量。做好了准备工作，也就等于做好了工程的一大半。没有足够的准备工作，仓促开工，只会造成浪费，并不能加快速度。而准备工作的主要环节则是正确地制订进度计划，认真进行施工组织设计和总平面图规划。
