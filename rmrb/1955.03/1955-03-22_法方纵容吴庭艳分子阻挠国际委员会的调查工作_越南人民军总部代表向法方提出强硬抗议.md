    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a Vietnam News Agency report from the 20th, General Văn Tiến Dũng, chief representative of the delegation from the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, handed a letter to the French representative of the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission in Vietnam on March 15th, lodging a strong protest against the French Federal Forces for conniving with Ngo Dinh Diem elements to obstruct the investigative work of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission.

    Văn Tiến Dũng listed facts, mentioning that in the No. 5 and No. 11 "refugee camps," Ngo Dinh Diem's special agents threw stones at the vehicles and meeting rooms of the international inspection teams. They shouted slogans like "Down with the International Commission" and "Down with India." The letter stated that Ngo Dinh Diem's special agents also attacked and insulted the Vietnam People's Army liaison officers accompanying the international inspection teams. The most serious incident occurred on March 1st, when Ngo Dinh Diem's special agents from Camp No. 11, armed with spears and knives, stormed into the meeting room of the international inspection team, attempting to harm the Vietnam People's Army liaison officers.

    The People's Army's letter pointed out that the purpose of these atrocities was to create difficulties for the International Commission, thereby preventing the latter from investigating or intervening in the Ngo Dinh Diem government's forced abduction of North Vietnamese residents.

    Văn Tiến Dũng finally demanded that the French side cease its atrocities obstructing the International Commission's investigations, punish the principal offenders, and guarantee the safety of the international inspection teams and Vietnamese liaison officers, providing them with all conveniences for their work.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Hanoi, March 19th via Vietnam News Agency: At the request of the Vietnam People's Army, the mobile inspection team of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission went to Chai Nghi, Kien An province in the Haiphong area on March 13th to investigate a forced relocation incident that had occurred there. According to preliminary reports, the county police chief admitted to the inspection team that acts of terror had occurred in the area and confessed that he himself had been among the masses in plain clothes, directing his special agents. However, in an attempt to cover up his crimes, he lied, saying that the incident was caused by economic reasons. His lies were immediately exposed by the local people, who came upon hearing of the inspection team's arrival. Eleven injured individuals have been brought to the scene to testify.

    On March 15th, the inspection team received several petitions from the local people, requesting that the inspection team urge the French Federal Forces to immediately end such acts of terror and provide compensation to the injured.

    法方纵容吴庭艳分子阻挠国际委员会的调查工作
    越南人民军总部代表向法方提出强硬抗议
    据新华社讯：据越南通讯社二十日报道：越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军三月十五日将一封信交给越南中央联合停战委员会的法方代表，强硬抗议法兰西联邦部队纵容吴庭艳分子阻挠越南国际监督和监察委员会的调查工作。
    文进勇列举事实，谈到在第五号、第十一号“难民营”，吴庭艳特务曾向国际视察小组的车辆和会议室丢石头。他们喊口号说“打倒国际委员会”，“打倒印度”。信件谈到吴庭艳特务还攻击和侮辱伴随国际视察小组的越南人民军联络官。最严重的一次发生在三月一日，第十一号营的吴庭艳特务，拿着长矛和小刀，冲进了国际视察小组的会议室，企图伤害越南人民军的联络官。
    人民军的信件指出，这些暴行的目的在于给国际委员会制造困难，从而阻止后者对吴庭艳政府的强迫劫运北越居民的活动进行调查或进行干涉。
    文进勇最后要求法方停止阻挠国际委员会调查的暴行；惩办主犯；保证国际视察小组和越方联络官的安全，给他们提供工作上的一切便利。
    据新华社讯：越南通讯社河内十九日讯：越南国际监督和监察委员会机动视察小组应越南人民军方面的要求，在三月十三日到海防地区建安省柴仪地方调查曾在那里发生的强迫迁移事件。据初步消息说，县警察局长向视察小组承认在这个地方曾发生恐怖行动，承认他自己曾身穿便服混在群众中指挥他的特务们行动。但是为了掩饰罪行，他撒谎说这次事件是由于经济原因引起的。他的谎话立即就被当地人民戳穿了，他们是在听到视察小组到来而赶来的。十一个受伤的人已经被带到现场作证。
    三月十五日，视察小组接到当地人民的一些请愿书，要求视察小组促使法兰西联邦部队方面立即结束这种恐怖行为并对受伤的人给予赔偿。
