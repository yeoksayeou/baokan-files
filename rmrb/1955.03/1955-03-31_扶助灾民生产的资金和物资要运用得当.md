It is understood that the work in some disaster areas is not being done well. Loans or materials are being issued blindly, which wastes state resources and fails to help disaster victims overcome the disaster. In the case of calico processing in the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province, due to a lack of specific organization, only 48,006 bolts of cloth were recovered by mid-February out of the 569,250 bolts of raw materials issued, accounting for just over 8 percent of the raw materials issued. Because so few finished products were recovered, disaster victims received little in the way of processing fees. Thus, although large quantities of cotton and cotton yarn were distributed, they did not play their proper role in supporting production. As a result of this blind distribution of raw materials for processing, some non-disaster-affected households took the cotton and put it away without weaving or spinning, saying, "I don't have time for this stuff." Some received too much, and calculated that they wouldn't be able to spin and weave it all before the wheat harvest. In some areas (such as Wuyang), most of the calico being processed does not meet the required specifications or quality. Some households also burned the cotton due to improper storage. Some households also sold and ate the cotton. Some households, seeing that no one was managing or asking about the cotton after they received it, planned to make the processed cloth into single-layer clothing to wear.

In Ye County and Yancheng, Henan Province, etc., those households that should have received sideline production loans did not receive them, while those that should not have received them did, with the result that the loans did not support disaster victims' efforts to help themselves through production, but instead resulted in waste and fostered the idea among disaster victims that they should simply rely on government relief. In Ye County, some non-disaster-affected people went to restaurants after receiving disaster relief loans. In Wulibao Township, Yiqu, Shangshui, more than 30 disaster-affected households relied solely on eating relief grain and money, and went to the cadres as soon as they had finished.

In some areas, the work of organizing disaster victims to transport grain was also very chaotic. Whenever there was a transport task, the loudspeaker would shout loudly: "Everyone, come and transport grain!" As a result, disaster victims and non-disaster victims all flocked there. Doing so cost the state a lot of effort, but did not do much to solve the disaster problem.

The weather is gradually warming, and agricultural work is increasing. On the one hand, we must continue to help disaster victims solve the current problem of food; on the other hand, we must actively help disaster victims overcome the difficulties in agricultural production such as lack of livestock, seeds, feed, and fertilizer. The leading departments in disaster areas, especially the economic departments, should quickly overcome the past tendency of "emphasizing input but not paying attention to results" and earnestly do a good job in economic work in disaster areas.

In practical work, we should go deep into the masses, verify the disaster situation, and truly grasp the principles of support and relief. Otherwise, the phenomenon of failing to provide relief to those who should be relieved and failing to support those who should be supported will occur. Li Fuxi, a poor peasant in Zhuanqiao Town, Jiuyu District, Yancheng, sold things off indiscriminately to survive the famine because the cadres did not give him a loan to engage in sideline production. Cadres and peasants in disaster areas must understand that it is not easy for the state to allocate large sums of money and materials to support production and provide disaster relief while carrying out industrial construction. Every cadre should cherish the state's investment in disaster areas, use them properly, and truly play the role of supporting farmers' production and self-reliance; every farmer in disaster areas should also use the state's support funds and materials correctly and actively engage in production. Only in this way can production in disaster areas be restored and developed.

    扶助灾民生产的资金和物资要运用得当
    赵静一
    据了解，有些灾区的工作做得很不好，盲目地向下发放贷款或物资，既浪费了国家资财，又不能帮助灾民战胜灾荒。河南省许昌专区的土布加工，由于缺乏具体组织工作，致使发放下去的五十六万九千二百五十匹布的原料，到二月中旬只收回四万八千零六匹布，占发放原料的百分之八点多。由于成品收回少，灾民得到工缴费也少，这样虽然发出了大批棉花、棉纱，但是没有起到应有的扶植生产的作用。由于这样盲目向下投放加工原料，有些非灾户把棉花领回放起来不织不纺，并说：“那有时间弄这东西。”有些领的太多，计算到麦熟也纺织不完。有些地区（如舞阳）加工的土布规格、质量多数不合要求。还有些户因保管不慎，棉花被烧掉了。也有些户把棉花卖吃了。有的户看到领回棉花后没人管没人问，就打算把加工的布做成单衣穿。
    河南省叶县、郾城等地在发放副业贷款中应发的户未发，不应发的反而发了，致使贷款起不到支持灾民生产自救的作用，反而形成浪费和养成灾民单纯依赖政府救济的思想。叶县有的非灾民领到救灾贷款后下馆子。商水一区五里堡乡有三十多户灾民单纯依靠吃救济粮款，吃完就找干部。
    有的地区在组织灾民运输运粮时，工作做的也很混乱，在一有运输任务时就用广播筒大声喊叫：“都快来运粮啊！”于是灾民、非灾民都一齐涌来了。这样做国家费力不少，但解决灾荒问题不大。
    目前天气渐暖，农活日多，工作任务更加繁重，一方面要继续扶助灾民解决当前的吃粮问题；一方面还要积极帮助灾民克服缺乏牲畜、种籽、饲料、肥料等农业生产上的困难。灾区领导部门特别是各经济部门，应该迅速克服以往“重投放，不注意效果”的偏向，切实把灾区经济工作做好。
    在实际工作中，应深入群众，查实灾情，和切实掌握扶持、救济的原则。不然，就会产生该救济的不救济，该扶植的不扶植的现象。郾城九区砖桥镇贫农李福喜就是因为干部没有贷给他款搞副业，就乱卖东西度荒。灾区的干部和农民都必须懂得国家在进行工业建设的时候，抽出大批钱和物资来扶持生产救灾是很不容易的事。每个干部都应该珍惜国家投入灾区的资金、物资，把它们用的得当，真正起到扶植农民生产自救的作用；每个灾区的农民也应该正确地使用国家扶助的资金和物资积极地进行生产。只有这样，灾区的生产才能得到恢复发展。
