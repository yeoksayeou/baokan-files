From what we understand, in recent years, there have been many unreasonable phenomena in the allocation and use of university graduates. It is very necessary to reflect these phenomena (some of which have been corrected) to promote the attention of relevant parties.

Some employing departments have not thoroughly studied the professional use of graduates and the actual needs of the work, and blindly assigned the work of graduates, resulting in unnecessary career changes. The allocation of graduates from the Building Equipment Department majoring in heating and ventilation by the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the summer of 1954 is one of the more typical examples. As everyone knows, there is a great shortage of heating and ventilation talent at present. However, in 1954, the Ministry of Heavy Industry assigned a group of graduates from the Building Equipment Department of Tongji University as if they had studied equipment materials. As a result, the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration (hereinafter referred to as the Nonferrous Bureau) Piping Engineering Company, which urgently needed heating and ventilation talent, did not get a single one assigned. They had to have graduates from certain majors in the Mechanical Engineering Department change their careers to do heating and ventilation work. On the other hand, units that did not need this kind of talent, such as the Nonferrous Bureau Metal Structure Engineering Company, were assigned three graduates from the Building Equipment Department. Among them, Wu Jingyu changed to do material inspection work, Li Tianbao changed to do work such as investigating the names, quantities, performance, and effectiveness of machinery, and Wu Zhenglun changed to do material supply work. Later, because of the inappropriate assignment, Wu Zhenglun insisted on doing his original work. The Metal Structure Engineering Company was forced to negotiate with the neighboring Nonferrous Bureau Piping Engineering Company and exchanged him for the aforementioned mechanical engineering graduates who had changed to do piping work. The Ministry of Heavy Industry also had serious problems in the allocation of graduates majoring in metal cutting and processing. According to Huang Liren and Zhao Bingzhao, who were assigned to the Metal Structure Engineering Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, one of them was engaged in budget quota work, and the other was doing monthly work plans, etc., which had nothing to do with what they had originally learned. In the summer of 1954, the Ministry of Heavy Industry emphasized the urgent need for talent to do railway construction and transportation work, but instead assigned Hou Fengming and Zhao Shibin, who studied railway construction, to the Nonferrous Bureau Metal Structure Engineering Company, which was completely unrelated to railway construction, and placed them in the crane section to do administrative work.

Such problems do not only occur in one department. The Ministry of Fuel Industry wanted some graduates majoring in metallographic heat treatment, but instead assigned Zheng Qicheng to the Beijing Design Branch of the Design Administration of the Electricity Management Bureau to design coal conveying machinery. In order to meet the needs of urban construction and large factory construction for highway construction, the Ministry of Construction Engineering requested many graduates majoring in highway construction, but they assigned Pan Jiahua and Zhao Deyuan, who studied road and bridge highway majors, to do factory building construction projects. In addition, in some employing departments, some let graduates majoring in metal cutting and processing be Russian language tutors; those majoring in forging and casting do labor management work; those majoring in engineering surveying do construction workers in the inspection section; those majoring in architectural design do labor insurance registration in the supervision office; those majoring in the manufacture of antibiotics such as penicillin and streptomycin do bread fermentation work; those majoring in fine arts do trade union personnel work; and those majoring in Russian do physical education teachers, and so on.

The phenomenon of some employing departments hoarding and wasting talent is also very serious. For example, some graduates assigned to the No. 4 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, because there was little work to do, spent the whole day reading newspapers, novels, and chatting, and were very uneasy. According to a letter from Ma Yongkai, a graduate of Shandong Medical College, in June 1954, when he worked at the Zaozhuang Coal Mine Clinic in Shandong, the mine had only more than 300 employees, but there were 24 medical staff; later, he was transferred to work at the Tiantun Coal Mine Clinic, which had only more than 70 people, including temporary workers, and already had three medical staff. He was idle there every day. In the summer of 1954, Chen Mengzhao, Wang Hangong, Zhao Shushan, and Yu Jiandong, surgical graduates assigned to the Fushun Municipal Health Bureau, were temporarily assigned to other places for internships (there was not much work either) because the Health Bureau could not assign work. Some industrial departments even requested medical graduates before the hospitals were established.

Some units assigned graduates with certain professional knowledge to do general work. Many graduates reflected that they only did copying, stencil printing, document receipt and distribution, stationery budgeting and storage, and other work. Some even let graduates majoring in law be salespersons in the sales department of a trading company or do reception, answering phones, visitor registration, ringing the bell for work and off-duty, and delivering newspapers in the switchboard room.

After the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena occurred, some departments adopted the correct attitude, so some problems have been solved; but some departments have various wrong attitudes towards this.

Some departments only emphasize the needs of their own departments and units, and even exaggerate the needs of their own units as the needs of the entire country, and regard "work needs" as a "shield", and do not correct those obviously unreasonable phenomena. Regardless of whether graduates studied mechanics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, or chemical engineering, they all require them to obey the so-called "work needs" of their own units; even, for their "work needs", they openly called on graduates to establish a "career change ideology". If higher-level departments want to transfer these graduates, they either say "a suitable person must be replaced", or threaten with "inability to complete the task, no one is responsible".

Some departments clearly know that the work assignment for some graduates is unreasonable, but they still do not humbly listen to the opinions of graduates, seriously study the professional use of graduates, understand the actual needs of the work, and realistically and reasonably adjust; but only generally believe that "university students learn basic knowledge, there is nothing specialized or not", and even pretend to understand, and say to graduates who request to adjust their work: "Mechanics and electricity are not separated." "It is also appropriate for those who study power generation to engage in mechanics."

In addition, there are also attitudes of delaying and ignoring the reasonable requests of graduates. They emphasize that they are busy with work and have no time to manage; they adopt a wrong attitude of forgiving the unreasonable use of graduates by subordinate units.

More seriously, some units, when dragging and ignoring cannot solve the problem or so-called "persuasion" is ineffective, then take suppressive measures against the opinions of graduates. They put a lot of individualistic "hats" such as "making ideological problems", "not being at ease with work", and "not obeying assignments" on the heads of graduates who request to adjust their work without specific analysis, trying to make graduates dare not express their opinions, so as to "preserve" cadres. One engineering graduate reflected that because he felt that it was not suitable for him to do labor and wage work, he requested to adjust his work. The comrades in the personnel section said to him: "Others also studied engineering, and they have no objection to being assigned to the education section and the security section. This is the country assigning you here. You should check whether you have the idea of fame and fortune of wanting to go elsewhere to be a technician or engineer." A medical graduate reflected that because his work was really too little, sometimes he had no patients all day, he applied to the leaders for transfer, but the leaders replied: "Do you still hope that people get sick?" Some departments even believe that graduates directly applying to the assigning unit for work transfer is "reporting to a higher level", is "an unorganized and undisciplined behavior", and therefore conduct inappropriate criticism of graduates, and even hold meetings to ask them to examine their thoughts, so that some graduates dare not express their opinions, so that the problem cannot be solved for a long time.

Of course, some university graduates have adopted an incorrect attitude towards organizational assignments. For example, some people have repeatedly refused to obey organizational assignments for personal purposes. This is also wrong.

In order to give full play to the role of university graduates in the cause of national construction and reduce the contradiction between supply and demand of graduates, it is hoped that all relevant departments will attach great importance to the issue of reasonable allocation and use of university graduates, and resolutely and quickly correct the phenomenon of wasting talent.

    决不能这样分配和使用高等学校毕业生
    陶公直
    据我们了解，几年来，在高等学校毕业生的分配和使用方面，存在着不少不合理的现象。把这些现象（有的已经纠正）反映出来，以促使有关方面的重视，是十分必要的。
    有的用人部门没有很好地研究毕业生专业用途和工作的实际需要，便盲目地分配毕业生的工作，以致造成了不应有的改行现象。重工业部一九五四年暑假对学暖气通风的建筑设备科毕业生的分配，就是比较典型的例子之一。大家知道，目前暖气通风的人材是十分缺乏的。但一九五四年重工业部却将同济大学建筑设备科的一批毕业生当做学设备材料的分配了。结果，急需暖气通风人材的有色金属工业管理局（以下简称有色局）管道工程公司连一个也没有分配去，他们只好让机械系某些专业的毕业生改做暖气通风工作；而另一方面，不需要这种人材的单位，如有色局金属结构工程公司却分配去三名建筑设备科毕业生，其中吴景瑜改做材料检验工作，李天保改做调查机械名称、数量、性能、效力等工作，吴正伦改做材料供应工作。后来吴正伦因分配不当，坚持要做本行工作，金属结构工程公司迫不得已，才和邻近的有色局管道工程公司协商，把他和前述改行做管道工作的机械系毕业生对调。重工业部在对金属切削加工专修科毕业生的分配上，也存在着严重的问题。据分配在武汉钢铁公司金属结构工程公司的黄力人、赵炳昭反映，他们一人搞预算定额工作，一人做每月作业计划等工作，原来所学的根本用不上。一九五四年暑假，重工业部曾强调迫切需要做铁道修建和运输工作的人材，但却把学铁路建筑的侯凤鸣、赵式彬分配到和修筑铁道完全无关的有色局金属结构工程公司，将他们安置在起重工段做行政事务工作。
    像这样的问题，不只发生在一个部门。燃料工业部曾要去一些学金相热处理的毕业生，但是却把其中的郑圻柽分配到电业管理总局设计管理局北京设计分局做给煤运输机械设计。建筑工程部为了满足城市建设和大的工厂建设中公路建设的需要，要去了不少学公路建筑专业的毕业生，但他们却将学道路和桥梁公路专业的毕业生潘家骅、赵德元分配做厂房建筑工程。此外，在某些用人部门当中，还有的让学金属切削加工的毕业生做俄文辅导员；学锻工、铸工的做劳动管理工作；学工程测量的在检查科做施工员；学建筑设计的在监察室搞劳动保险登记；学青霉素、链霉素等抗生素制造的做面包发酵工作；学美术的做工会人事工作；学俄文的做体育教员，等等。
    有的用人部门积压浪费人材的现象也很严重。如分配去重工业部有色局第四工程公司的部分毕业生，因为工作少，没事干，有的竟整天看报，看小说，聊闲天，情绪非常不安。又据山东医学院本科毕业生马永凯一九五四年六月来信反映，他在山东枣庄煤矿医务所工作时，该矿仅三百多职工，却有二十四个医务人员；后来他被调去田屯煤矿医务所工作，该矿连临时工在内只有七十多人，并已有三个医务人员，他每天都闲在那里。一九五四年暑假，分配去抚顺市卫生局的外科毕业生陈孟昭、王汉巩、赵树珊和俞建东，因卫生局无法分配工作，竟被暂时派到别处实习（工作也不多）。还有的工业部门的医院尚未建立，就要去了医科毕业生。
    有的单位，把具有一定专业知识的毕业生分配去做一般的工作。不少毕业生反映，他们只是干些抄写、刻蜡板、文件收发、文具预算和保管等工作。还有让学政法的毕业生做贸易公司门市部的售货员或在传达室做收发、接电话、来访登记、打上下班铃、送报纸等工作的。
    类似上述不合理的现象发生以后，有的部门采取了正确的态度，因而有些问题已得到解决；但也有些部门，对此抱着种种错误的态度。
    有的部门，只强调本部门、本单位的需要，甚至把本单位的需要，夸大为整个国家的需要，把
  “工作需要”当做一种“挡箭牌”，对那些显然是不合理的现象也不纠正。他们不管毕业生学的是机械、电机、土木、化工，都一概要他们服从他们本单位的所谓“工作需要”；甚至，为了他们的“工作需要”，竟公开号召毕业生要树立“改行思想”。如果上级部门要来调动这些毕业生，则他们不是说
  “必须换一个合适的人来代替”，便以“完不成任务，没人负责”相要挟。
    有的部门分明知道对某些毕业生的工作分配是不合理的，但他们仍不虚心听取毕业生的意见，认真研究毕业生所学专业的用途，了解工作的实际需要情况，实事求是地予以合理调整；而只是笼统地认为，“大学生所学的是基本知识，没有什么专不专”，乃至不懂装懂，对要求调整工作的毕业生说：“机、电不分家。”“学发电的搞机械也算合适。”
    除此，也有对毕业生提出的合理要求采取拖延不理的态度的。他们强调工作忙，没时间管；对下属单位不合理使用毕业生的现象，采取错误的原谅态度。
    更严重的是，有的单位在拖拉不理不能解决问题时或所谓“说服”无效时，就进而对毕业生的意见采取压制的办法。他们将“闹思想问题”，“不安心工作”，“不服从分配”等一大堆个人主义的“帽子”，不加具体分析地扣到要求调整工作的毕业生头上，企图使毕业生不敢再提意见，借以“保存”干部。一位工科毕业生反映，他由于感到自己作劳动工资工作不合适，要求调整工作，人事科的同志对他说：“人家也是念工的，分配到教育科和保卫科都没有意见。这是国家分配你来的，你要检查一下，是否有想到别处去当技术员、工程师的名利思想。”一位学医的毕业生反映，因为自己工作实在太少，有时整天没有病人，便向领导方面申请调动，领导方面却回答说：“你还希望人们生病吗？”有些部门竟然认为毕业生直接向分配单位申请调动工作是“越级告状”，是“无组织无纪律的行为”，因而对毕业生进行不恰当的批评，甚至开会要他们检查思想，使得有些毕业生有意见也不敢提，以致问题长期不能解决。
    当然，也有些高等学校毕业生对组织分配采取了不正确的态度。例如有人为了个人目的，一再拒绝服从组织分配。这也是不对的。
    为了充分发挥高等学校毕业生在国家建设事业中的作用，减少毕业生供不应求的矛盾，希望各有关部门对于合理分配和使用高等学校毕业生这一问题给予高度的重视，坚决地、迅速地纠正浪费人材的现象。
