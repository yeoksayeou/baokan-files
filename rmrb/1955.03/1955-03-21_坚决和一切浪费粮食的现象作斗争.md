    Resolutely Fight Against All Phenomena of Wasting Food
    An Gang
    In contact with some comrades responsible for administrative management in government offices, I asked them if they had ever noticed any waste of food. The answer was almost always the same: "With the implementation of planned supply, there is no surplus food, so there can't be any waste." The reasons these comrades generally gave were these: First, we have a firm count of how many people there are, and we receive exactly that amount of grain. Second, our rice, flour, and oil coupon system is very strict, so nothing can go wrong. Third, the Three-Anti Campaign eliminated waste long ago, so waste won't happen.
    What is the reality? It can be stated with certainty that the phenomenon of wasting food has not disappeared spontaneously due to planned supply. On the contrary, it is still quite common. As long as we soberly examine the situation in this regard, we will find many problems. We can see the seriousness of this issue from the following incident.
      On December 8, 1954, a comrade named Lian Haishan wrote a letter exposing various facts of the former Northeast Fourth Company, affiliated with the Northeast Engineering Bureau of the Central Construction Engineering Ministry, violating national grain and oil supply policies. After investigation by relevant parties, the facts have now been initially clarified. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee is dealing with this serious incident of policy violation.
    The preliminary results of the investigation are:
    The company consistently falsely reported the number of people entitled to food, fraudulently claiming and obtaining large amounts of oil and grain. In the ten months from March to December 1954, the number of people listed for oil and grain applications falsely included 34 cadres at the department level or above, 18 engineers, 22 assistant engineers, 32 junior engineers, and 8 regular physicians, totaling 114 people falsely reported. In March to June of the same year, they hoarded more than 10,000 catties of fine grains. The welfare section of the administrative department falsely reported and fraudulently obtained two "grain purchase certificates," falsely reporting 270 people. At the same time, they used this method to fraudulently obtain cooking oil for a long time, fraudulently obtaining more than 1,380 catties of cooking oil from June to December alone. There were many ways to fraudulently obtain these goods. Some were re-reported after already being claimed, while others deliberately did not return the excess oil coupons of employees to the government. What were the fraudulently obtained grains and cooking oil used for? In short, it was to disrupt planned supply and cause a large amount of waste. Within two months, they over-distributed 740 catties of cooking oil to the employee canteen and the nutrition canteen, with the nutrition canteen receiving an average of 1.6 catties more per person per month. In September, the employee canteen received 450 catties more cooking oil in one instance, exceeding its due amount by about 150%. A small group of people took advantage of the chaotic situation of waste to enrich themselves. Some management personnel collectively privately purchased grain and non-staple foods and secretly distributed them among themselves. Last July, when Welfare Section Chief Yu Junbo and four others purchased grain for the canteen, they privately bought back 270 catties of grain in one go. Yu himself also secretly exchanged good sorghum rice from the canteen for inferior sorghum rice. Yang Ming, the head of the administrative welfare section, asked the canteen to set aside more grain for him and arbitrarily purchased a bag of good white flour, 50 catties of rice, and 4 catties of cooking oil from the canteen. The reason why the heads of the administrative section and the welfare section dared to blatantly violate policies was because they were good at "taking care of the leaders." Those who were "taken care of" included the company's deputy managers Zhang Chao and Yuan Shengli, and Party Committee member Xu Chuanchen. Their mouths were stopped, so they had to let the management staff violate policies and waste grain.
    It is understood that in the process of handling this incident, the leadership of these units did not truly recognize the seriousness of the problem in principle, and some people even showed a certain degree of resistance. The Supervision Office of the Bureau and the Discipline Inspection Committee and Supervision Office of the Company did a lot of work. They put forward opinions on punishing relevant derelict personnel, which are all necessary. But we should not regard this matter merely as an ordinary individual incident, but should recognize that this is a serious act that endangers national interests. Grain is the material foundation for our country's socialist construction. All acts of stealing and damaging grain endanger the fundamental interests of building socialism. We must make everyone understand this issue from the perspective of the general line and general task. Some comrades regard wasting grain as a "minor matter." They do not understand that wasting grain is undermining the Party's policies.
    To correctly implement the planned grain supply policy, we must strengthen mass supervision. Violations of grain policies and acts of wasting grain cannot escape the eyes of the masses. We must encourage the masses to learn from Comrade Lian Haishan's spirit of safeguarding national interests and resolutely fight against all phenomena of undermining policies and wasting grain.

    坚决和一切浪费粮食的现象作斗争
    安岗
    在和一些担负机关行政管理工作的同志接触当中，我曾问过他们有没有发现过浪费粮食的现象。回答几乎都是同样的一句话：“实行了计划供应，没有了多余的粮食，那里会有浪费。”这些同志所列举的理由一般有这样几个：第一，我们有多少人，就领多少粮，计算得实打实。第二，我们的米、面、油票制度很严，出不了鬼。第三，三反运动早把浪费给反掉了，浪费不会发生。
    事实如何呢？可以肯定地说：浪费粮食的现象并没有因为计划供应就自流地消失，相反地，它还是相当普遍地存在着的；只要我们清醒地检查一下这方面的情况，就会发现很多问题。我们从下面这件事就可以看到这个问题的严重性。
      一九五四年十二月八日，一位名叫连海山的同志写信揭发了中央建筑工程部东北工程管理局所属原东北第四公司，违犯国家粮油供应政策的各种事实。经过有关方面调查，现已把事实初步弄清。中共沈阳市委纪律检查委员会正在处理这一违反政策的严重事件。
    初步检查的结果是：
    公司常年虚报名额，冒领和骗取大量油、粮。一九五四年三月至十二月十个月内，请领油、粮名额中，虚报处级以上干部三十四名，工程师十八名，副工程师二十二名，助理工程师三十二名，正式医师八名，总共虚报一百一十四名。同年三至六月份囤存细粮达一万多斤。行政科福利组虚报冒领两本“购粮证”，虚报名额二百七十名。同时利用这种办法长年骗领食油，仅六月至十二月份就骗领食油一千三百八十多斤。骗领的办法很多，有的是已经领过又重报骗领，有的把多领了的职工油票故意不退回给政府。虚报冒领来的粮食和食油作什么用呢？一句话，就是破坏了计划供应，造成了大量的浪费。他们在两个月内就多发给职工食堂及营养食堂七百四十斤食油，其中营养食堂每人每月平均多领一点六斤。九月份职工食堂一次即多领食油四百五十斤，超过其应领额的一倍半左右。一小群混水摸鱼的人，利用浪费混乱情况乘机自肥。有些管理人员集体私购粮食和副食品暗中分用。福利组长于俊波等五人去年七月在食堂购粮的时候，一次就私自多买回粮食二百七十斤，于本人还用次秫米窃换食堂的好秫米。行政福利科长杨明和要食堂给他多留粮食，擅自从食堂购出好白面一袋，大米五十斤，食油四斤。从行政科长到福利组长所以敢于放肆地破坏政策，这是因为他们很会“照顾领导”。被“照顾”的有该公司副经理张超、袁生理和党委委员徐传琛。这些人都从管理人员手里多买了数目不等的粮食和豆油。他们的嘴被堵住了，只得放纵管理工作人员去破坏政策，浪费粮食。
    据了解，在处理这个事件的过程中，这些单位的领导方面，并没有从原则上真正认识这个问题的严重性，有些人还有某种程度的抵抗。管理局监察室和公司纪律检查委员会、监察室等作了不少的工作。他们对有关失职人员提出了处分的意见，这都是必要的。但我们不应当把这件事仅只看作是一个普普通通的个别的事件，应该认识到这是一种严重危害国家利益的行为。粮食是我们国家进行社会主义建设的物质基础。一切盗窃和损坏粮食的行为，都危害了建设社会主义的根本利益。我们一定要使每一个人从总路线总任务的角度上去认识这个问题。有些同志把浪费粮食看成是件“小事”，他们不了解，糟踏粮食就是破坏党的政策。
    要正确地执行粮食计划供应政策，必须加强群众性的监督。违反粮食政策和浪费粮食的行为，都瞒不过群众的眼睛。要鼓励群众学习连海山同志那样的维护国家利益的精神，坚决和一切破坏政策和浪费粮食现象进行斗争。
