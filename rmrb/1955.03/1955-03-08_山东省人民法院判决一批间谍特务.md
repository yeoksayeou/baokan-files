The Shandong Provincial People's Court publicly sentenced on February 17th a batch of spies and secret agents, whose crimes had been verified by public security organs and prosecuted by the Provincial People's Procuratorate. These included the American paratrooper spy Zhu Fengqi, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents Guo Jiuqian, Su Yucai, Li Hongqi, and criminals Zhao Yanhua and Gao Lingfang, to death and imprisonment.

Zhu Fengqi (also known as Zhu Kecheng, Zhu Zuo), spy code name 324, served as a Japanese puppet and Chiang Kai-shek officer for many years. In December 1950, he fled to Hong Kong and joined the "Free China Movement," a special agent organization affiliated with the American intelligence agency "Central Intelligence Agency." He was sent to the "Free China Movement Military and Political Cadre School" (also known as the Asian Resistance School), an American spy training institution on Saipan Island, where he received training in espionage techniques such as demolition, "psychological warfare," "underground warfare," and secret communication. In 1952, he was dispatched to the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" resident in Atsugi, Japan, to receive espionage missions: to establish "safe houses" and "sea landing points" in the Shandong Peninsula and along the Jiaoji Railway to cover American espionage activities. On September 7th of the same year, Zhu Fengqi was escorted by American planes by American spy John Thomas Downey and others to Seoul, Korea, and on the night of the 9th, he parachuted into Phoenix Ridge in Zhangqiu County, Shandong. Zhu first sneaked into Jinan City and hid in the home of his mistress, Zhao Yanhua. Then, disguised, he sneaked to Shenyang, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and along the Jiaoji Railway to carry out espionage activities. During the investigation of Zhu, our public security organs successively seized parachutes, revolvers, bullets, codebooks, compasses, forged documents, activity funds, and shovels for burying evidence.

Guo Jiuqian (alias Guo Xuanqing), served as a Japanese puppet and Chiang Kai-shek officer for many years, and had been captured and released by us several times. However, the criminal showed no repentance. In 1950, he fled to Hong Kong again and joined Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization. In January 1954, he was appointed as the head of the "Jinan Work Station," and in February, he sneaked back to Jinan to carry out espionage activities. In Jinan, Guo actively established an "underground" Kuomintang secret service organization, collected our military, political, and economic intelligence, and secretly reported it to Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization in Hong Kong many times. He also received special activity funds remitted by the Hong Kong special service organization and attempted to set up a store in the Jinan People's Commercial Building as a long-term activity cover.

Su Yucai was a secret agent of Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Committee." In the spring of 1954, after sneaking back to his native village of Danmiao Village, Eighth District, Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province, he secretly and actively collected our military, political, and economic intelligence and secretly reported it to Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization in Hong Kong several times. In August of the same year, Su Yucai lured Li Hongqi from the same village to join the secret service organization and engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

Zhao Yanhua (female) and Gao Lingfang (female) had known Zhu Fengqi before liberation. In 1950, when Zhu fled from the Northeast to Hong Kong, Zhao Yanhua hid Zhu for three days and subsidized his travel expenses. This time, after Zhu parachuted into Jinan, Zhao hid Zhu again, changed his plain clothes, hid and burned his documents, and sent Zhu to Gao Lingfang's home, instigating Gao to sew Zhu's codebook into a quilt, and then secretly sending Zhu away.

The Shandong Provincial People's Court sentenced Zhu Fengqi and Guo Jiuqian to death in accordance with the law, to be executed immediately; sentenced Zhao Yanhua to life imprisonment; sentenced Gao Lingfang to two years of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve; Su Yucai should have been severely punished, but because he showed remorse during the trial, he was treated leniently and sentenced to life imprisonment; Li Hongqi joined the special service organization after liberation and should have been severely punished, but because he had not committed any serious sabotage and showed repentance after his arrest, he was given a lighter sentence of five years of imprisonment.

    山东省人民法院判决一批间谍特务
    山东省人民法院于二月十七日公开判处了经公安机关侦察属实、由省人民检察院公诉的美国空降间谍祝凤琦、蒋贼特务郭玖谦、苏玉才、李鸿企和罪犯赵延华、高凌芳等死刑和徒刑。
    祝犯凤琦（又名竺可成、祝祚），间谍代号三二四，历充日伪、蒋贼军官多年。一九五零年十二月潜逃香港，参加了美国间谍机关“中央情报局”所属的特务组织“自由中国运动”，被送往塞班岛美国间谍训练机构“自由中国运动军政干部学校”（又名亚洲抵抗学校），受爆破、“心理战”、“地下战”、秘密通讯等间谍技术训练。一九五二年又被派往美国“中央情报局”驻日本厚木间谍机关接受间谍任务：在山东半岛和胶济铁路沿线建立掩护美国间谍特务活动的“安全处所”和“海运登陆点”。同年九月七日，祝犯凤琦乘美国飞机由美国美籍间谍约翰·托马斯·唐奈等护送至朝鲜汉城，九日夜晚空降到山东章邱县凤凰岭上。祝犯先潜入济南市其姘妇赵延华家中藏匿，接着便化装潜赴沈阳、天津、广州及胶济铁路沿线等地进行特务活动。我公安机关在侦缉祝犯中，先后搜获了降落伞、左轮手枪、子弹、明密电码本、指北针和伪造的各种证件、活动经费以及掩埋罪证的铁锹等罪证。
    郭犯玖谦（化名郭选卿），历充日伪、蒋贼军官多年，曾迭次被我俘获释放。但该犯毫不悔改，一九五零年复潜逃香港，参加了蒋贼特务组织；一九五四年一月被委任为“济南工作站”站长，二月即潜回济南进行特务活动。郭犯在济南曾积极建立
  “地下”国民党特务组织，搜集我军事、政治和经济等情报，多次密报给香港的蒋贼特务机关，并接到由香港特务组织汇来的特务活动费，企图在济南市人民商场设立商店，作为其长期活动掩护点。
    苏犯玉才，系蒋贼“中委会”特务分子。一九五四年春潜回原籍山东嘉祥县八区单庙村后，便暗中积极搜集我军事、政治、经济等情报，向香港的蒋贼特务机关密报数次。同年八月，苏犯又诱惑本村李鸿企加入特务组织，进行反革命活动。
    赵犯延华（女）、高犯凌芳（女），在解放前就同祝犯凤琦相识。一九五零年祝犯由东北逃往香港时，赵犯延华曾窝藏祝犯三天，并资助其路费。这次祝犯空降来济南后，赵犯又窝藏祝犯，为其更换便衣、埋藏和焚毁证件等；还将祝犯送至高凌芳家中，主使高将祝犯明密电码本缝入棉被，随后并将祝犯秘密送走。
    山东省人民法院依法判处祝犯凤琦、郭犯玖谦死刑，立即执行；判处赵犯延华无期徒刑；判处高犯凌芳有期徒刑二年、缓刑二年；对苏犯玉才，本应严惩，因其在审讯中有悔悟表现，故从宽处理，判处无期徒刑；李犯鸿企，解放后参加特务组织，本应严惩，但因其尚无严重破坏行为，就捕后又有悔改之意，故从轻处理，判处其有期徒刑五年。（本报济南记者）
