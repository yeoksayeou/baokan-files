Hunan is Massively Producing Lime Fertilizer
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province have organized more than 5,000 lime kilns to produce lime fertilizer for farmers. These lime kilns plan to produce 1 billion jin of lime this year, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year, which can provide fertilizer for more than 12 million mu of paddy fields.
    Most areas of Hunan Province have acidic red soil, which is suitable for using lime as fertilizer. This year, in addition to the more than 200 million jin of lime produced by local state-owned and joint state-private lime factories to supply farmers' needs, the main supply comes from local supply and marketing cooperatives organizing the large-scale production of local lime kilns. As early as January, a large amount of lime had been successively supplied to farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives of Shaodong, Xupu, and Ningxiang counties have supplied farmers with more than 40 million jin of lime. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南大量烧制石灰肥料
    湖南省各地供销合作社已组织五千多座石灰窑为农民烧制石灰肥料。这些石灰窑，今年准备烧制石灰十亿斤，比去年增加一倍半，可供一千二百多万亩稻田施肥用。
    湖南省大部分地区是酸性较重的红土壤，适用石灰做肥料。今年除由地方国营和公私合营的石灰工厂生产二亿多斤石灰供应农民需要外，主要由各地供销合作社组织当地石灰窑大量生产。早在一月份，各石灰窑已将大批石灰陆续供应到农民手中。邵东、溆浦、宁乡三县供销合作社供应给农民的石灰已有四千多万斤。（新华社）
