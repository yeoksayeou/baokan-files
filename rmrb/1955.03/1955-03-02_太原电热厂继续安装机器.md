    Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant Continues Installing Machinery
    Installation workers at the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant construction site are continuing with the installation of steam turbines and boilers.
    The construction of this modern power plant is divided into two phases. The civil engineering work of the first phase was completed last year, and partial power generation began in December of last year. After the newly installed machinery is put into production successively this year, the power generated by the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant will increase three times compared to the current power generation. At that time, the power supplied by the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant will be equal to 153% of the original power capacity of Taiyuan City.
    In order to complete the new installation tasks, the installation workers, with the help and guidance of Soviet experts, have absorbed the construction experience of last year and are doing better and faster. For example, the installation project of a certain boiler has been identified as having better quality than the boiler installed last year. During the pressure test, the steam pressure reached the statutory indicators, and there were no leaks or seepage in any of the welded joints or expanded joints. In the installation of a certain steam turbine, they summarized the experience of last year and improved the operation methods during the installation, which enabled the task of secondary grouting of the fixed foundation to be completed nine days ahead of schedule.

    太原电热厂继续安装机器
    太原电热厂工地的安装工人正继续进行汽轮机和锅炉的安装工程。
    这座现代化发电厂的建厂工程共分两期完成，去年已完成了第一期工程的土木建筑任务，并在去年十二月开始局部发电。今年内新安装的机器陆续投入生产后，太原电热厂所发的电力就要比现在的发电量增加三倍，那时太原电热厂供应的电力就可等于太原市原有电量的百分之一百五十三。
    为完成新的安装任务，安装工人们在苏联专家的帮助与指导下，吸取去年的施工经验，做到了更好更快。如某号锅炉的安装工程，根据鉴定比去年安装的锅炉的质量更加良好，升压试验时，汽压达到法定指标，所有的焊口与涨口，无一处漏水和渗水。安装某号汽轮机中由于他们总结了去年的经验，安装当中又改进了操作方法，使固定基础二次浇灌水泥的任务，比计划提前九天完成了。
