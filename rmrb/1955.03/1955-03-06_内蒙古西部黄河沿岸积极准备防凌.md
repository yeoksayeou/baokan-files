Western Inner Mongolia Yellow River coastal areas, including Baotou City, Sarachi County, Tokto County, and Urad Front Banner, established ice prevention organizations in late February. They are now actively mobilizing the masses to prepare tools and firewood for ice breaking work. The Baotou Municipal People's Government began conducting key drilling and comprehensive pacing surveys of the entire Yellow River section within its borders on January 15th. By the 5th, the engineering corps and civilian workers participating in ice prevention had completed blasting; artillery and air force personnel are surveying positions, preparing to join the ice prevention effort in the coming days. The Yellow River ice flood is a major threat to the western Inner Mongolia region every March. The People's Government began constructing over 1,000 li of Yellow River flood control dikes in 1950, which not only ensured the safe passage of annual autumn floods but also acted as a barrier during ice floods. During the annual ice flood season, the People's Government also dispatches cannons and aircraft to bomb ice bridges and ice dams, further ensuring the safety of the flood season.

    内蒙古西部黄河沿岸积极准备防凌
    内蒙古西部黄河沿岸的包头市、萨拉齐县、托克托县、乌拉特前旗等地人民政府在二月下旬分别成立防凌组织，现正积极发动群众准备工具柴草，进行破冰工作。包头市人民政府在一月十五日就开始对境内黄河全段冰层进行了重点钻探和全面步测。到五日，参加防凌的工兵和民工已爆破完毕；炮兵和空军们正在勘察阵地，准备不日投入防凌斗争。每年三月，黄河凌汛是内蒙古西部地区的极大威胁，人民政府在一九五零年就开始兴修黄河防洪堤一千多里，不但使连年秋汛安全渡过，同时在凌汛中也起了屏障作用。每年凌汛期间，人民政府还派大炮、飞机轰炸冰桥、冰坝，进一步保证汛期安全。（本报记者包头讯）
