The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has organized this "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" lecture to help literary and art workers systematically study Marxism-Leninism. We are greatly encouraged by the strong support from the Marxist-Leninist Academy and the enthusiastic participation of all comrades.

Making an effort to study ideology and arming ourselves with Marxism-Leninism is of paramount importance for us intellectuals, especially literary and art workers, today.

Our study should begin with the basics. Dialectical materialism and historical materialism are the foundation of Marxism-Leninism. They provide us with the key to understanding natural and social phenomena. When we understand this key, we can uncover the laws of development of the objective world and promote its development according to these laws, which means transforming the objective world—including the transformation of ourselves.

Today, our general task is to transform agricultural China into a socialist industrialized country. If we are not proficient in dialectical and historical materialism, it is inconceivable that we can achieve such a great task.

Literary and artistic work is an important link in the cause of socialist construction. Literary and art workers must embody socialist realism and produce more works with high ideological and artistic quality to serve the people, to inspire the people, to unite the people, to educate the people, to increase the people's production enthusiasm, to strengthen the people's construction efforts, to promote the realization of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and thus to correspondingly improve and develop literature and art itself. If we are not proficient in dialectical and historical materialism, it is inconceivable that we can shoulder such a glorious task.

Marxism-Leninism is a universally applicable truth. The continuous and great historical facts since the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution have proven to us that as long as we can grasp Marxism-Leninism, as long as we can make Marxism-Leninism grasp the masses and transform it into a material force, then we are invincible.

Our enemies also clearly know this. Therefore, they are painstakingly trying to disarm us ideologically, trying to replace dialectical and historical materialism with subjective idealism.

The evidence need not be too far away. Just look at the facts before our eyes.

Currently, we are criticizing the top war criminal Hu Shi. Hasn't he been shouting at us since the "May Fourth" era: "Talk less about isms," "Don't be led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin"?

Another person is Hu Feng, who has been selling subjective idealism under the guise of Marxism-Leninism for more than twenty years. Hasn't he also been desperately shouting at our literary and art workers: Don't have the standpoint of the working class, don't have a communist worldview, don't accept ideological remolding, don't recognize the leadership of the proletariat?

Hu Shi and Hu Feng are different in appearance. One openly sells American goods, and the other smuggles Japanese goods, but the goods are the same. Their commonality in essence is that they want to seize leadership with bourgeois subjective idealism. They want to disarm us of our Marxist-Leninist ideology, to make us lose our ideological position, lose our work direction, and surrender to imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie.

We must relentlessly counterattack these ideological enemies. We must not only criticize their ideas in writing, but also resist the toxins they spread in our life practice.

Hu Shi wants us to "talk less about isms." Our positive answer is: "Nonsense! We are going to talk more about isms!"

Hu Feng wants us not to have an ideological position and reject ideological remolding. Our positive answer is: "Nonsense! We are going to firmly strive for the working-class standpoint and the communist worldview, and undergo ideological remolding without reservation."

We must have a firm ideological position and be proficient in methods to be able to distinguish between friends and enemies, so as not to be infected by enemy ideology; to be able to judge the right and wrong, good and evil of works, and selectively accept or abandon the essence and dross of cultural heritage; to be able to distinguish typical characters in typical environments, and then reflect them creatively.

Don't think we have learned too much! No, on the contrary, our learning is really not enough. We were once deceived by "The Life of Wu Xun" and then deceived by "Studies of the Dream of the Red Chamber." We were once played by Hu Shi and then deceived by Hu Feng. This proves that our ideological foundation is really very weak.

It is a fact that we have not produced a large number of works with high ideological and artistic quality in the past five years. But the reason is definitely not, as Hu Feng said, that ideological remolding has "suffocated" writers, but that many writers have long been suffocated by toxic ideas and have not fully recovered.

Today should be the time for us to intensify our studies and catch up quickly. The people of all China are expecting us, and the people all over the world who want to learn from China's revolutionary victory are also expecting us. We must not let China's new literature and art always lag behind the great reality. The organization of this ideological lecture is also intended to more solidly lay our ideological foundation and promote our literary and artistic production to meet the needs of the people. The enthusiastic support of the comrades shows that we have a common desire.

Such collective learning makes it easier for us to appreciate the spirit of collectivism. Comrades, let us always maintain this enthusiasm and persevere in our studies! Let us apply this enthusiasm for learning to our work posts and creative practices as well!

We must strive to master the theory of Marxism-Leninism and transform it into a material force. First of all, we must arm all five million intellectuals in our country with communist ideas and methods to complete our great task of building a socialist society.

    学习辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义
    ——“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”讲座开幕词中国文学艺术界联合会主席　郭沫若
    中国文联这一次组织了“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”讲座，用以帮助文学艺术工作者有系统地进行马克思列宁主义的学习，得到马克思列宁学院的大力支持和各位同志的踊跃参加，使我们感受到很大的鼓舞。
    努力进行思想学习，用马克思列宁主义来武装自己，在今天对于我们知识分子，特别是文艺工作者，是有头等的重要性的。
    我们的学习应该从基本学起。辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是马克思列宁主义的基础。这给予我们以了解自然现象和社会现象的窍门。我们懂得这个窍门，便能够揭发客观世界的发展规律，并按照这种规律去促进客观世界的发展，也就是改造客观世界——包含我们自己的改造在内。
    在今天，我们的总任务是要把农业的中国改造成为社会主义工业化的国家。如果我们不精通辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，要想实现这样伟大的任务，是不能设想的。
    文学艺术工作是社会主义建设事业的一个重要环节。文艺工作者要体现社会主义现实主义，要多多产生有高度思想性和艺术性的作品来为人民服务，来鼓舞人民，团结人民，教育人民，来提高人民的生产热情，加强人民的建设努力，促进社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的实现，并因而使文学艺术本身得到相应的提高和发展。如果我们不精通辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，要想担负得起这样光荣的任务，也是不能设想的。
    马克思列宁主义是放诸四海而皆准的普遍真理。伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以来的不断的伟大的历史事实替我们证明：只要我们能够掌握马克思列宁主义，只要我们能够使马克思列宁主义掌握群众而转化成为物质的力量，那我们是不可战胜的。
    我们的敌人也明白地知道这一点。因此，他们正费尽苦心地想解除我们的思想上的武装，想把主观唯心论来代替辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。
    证据不必举得太远，就请举出我们眼前的事实吧。
    目前我们正在批判着头等战犯胡适。他不是自“五四”时代以来就一直在向着我们喊话：“少谈些主义”，“不要被马克思、列宁、斯大林牵着鼻子走”吗？
    另外一位是披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，二十多年来一直贩卖着主观唯心论的胡风。他不是也一直力竭声嘶地在向着我们文艺工作者叫喊：不要有工人阶级的立场，不要有共产主义的世界观，不要接受思想改造，不要承认无产阶级的领导吗？
    胡适和胡风在外表上是有所不同，他们一个公开地贩卖着美国货，一个走私地贩卖着日本货，然而货色是一样的。他们在本质上的一个共同点：便是想用资产阶级的主观唯心论来夺取领导地位。他们想解除我们的马克思列宁主义的思想武装，叫我们失掉思想立场，失掉工作方向，向帝国主义和买办资产阶级缴械投降。
    这些思想上的敌人，我们要毫不容情地加以反击。我们不仅要在文字上来批判他们的思想，我们还要在生活实践上来抗拒他们所散播的毒素。
    胡适要我们“少谈些主义”，我们的正面回答就是：“胡说！我们正要多谈些主义！”
    胡风要我们不要思想立场，拒绝思想改造，我们的正面回答就是：“胡说！我们正要坚决地争取工人阶级立场和共产主义世界观，毫无保留地进行思想改造。”
    我们要有坚定的思想立场，并精通方法，才能够分清敌友，不致为敌性思想所感染；才能够判断作品的是非善恶，分别接受或扬弃文化遗产的精华和糟粕；才能够辩别典型环境中的典型性格，从而加以创造性的反映。
    不要认为我们已经学习得太多了！不，相反，我们的学习实在很不够。我们曾经被“武训传”蒙蔽过，而又被“红楼梦研究”蒙蔽了。我们曾经被胡适玩弄过，而又被胡风欺骗了。这就证明：我们的思想根底实在是薄弱得很。
    五年来我们还没有多量地产生出有高度思想性和艺术性的作品，这是事实。但这原因决不是如像胡风所说，由于思想改造“闷杀”了作家，而是由于不少的作家们早被有毒素的思想闷杀，还没有十分转得过气来。
    在今天应该是我们加紧学习，急起直追的时候。全中国的人民都在期待着我们，全世界想从中国的革命胜利学习经验的人民也都期待着我们。我们不要让中国的新文艺老是落在伟大现实的后边。这一次的思想讲座的组织，也就是想更坚实地打好我们的思想基础，来促进我们的文艺生产以满足人民的要求。同志们的热烈支持表示着我们具有共同的愿望。
    这样的集体学习使得我们更加容易体会到集体主义的精神。同志们，请让我们始终保持着这种热情，坚持学习吧！请让我们把这种学习热情同样用到工作岗位上和创作实践上去吧！
    我们要努力掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，并使它转化为物质的力量，首先要让我们全国五百万的知识分子能够全部用共产主义的思想和方法武装起来，来完成我们的建设社会主义社会的伟大任务。
