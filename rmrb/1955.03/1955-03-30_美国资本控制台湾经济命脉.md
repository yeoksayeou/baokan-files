    US Capital Controls Taiwan's Economic Lifeline

    American economic forces, through "US aid" and private investment, have infiltrated Taiwan and controlled its economic lifeline.

    According to Taiwanese newspapers, American capital in Taiwan is becoming increasingly powerful. Reports indicate that from 1951 to 1954, the United States, under the guise of "industrial construction aid," injected a total of US$200 million into Taiwan's industrial sector. The so-called "industrial construction program" investment in 1954 increased by 61% compared to 1951. The use and allocation of these "US aid" funds are carried out under the direction of the US government and the supervision of American officials. Over the past four years, 27% of these "industrial construction aid" funds have been invested in Taiwan's electric power industry, 20% in the fertilizer industry, 16% in transportation, and the remaining 37% in Taiwan's sugar, chemical, metal, timber, textile, fishing, telecommunications, cement, and other industrial sectors. As a result, American monopoly capital controls Taiwan's major industrial sectors. Newspaper reports state that the American White Engineering Corporation controls Taiwan's transportation and construction industries, the American Westinghouse Electric Corporation controls Taiwan's electric power industry, the American Reynolds Metals Company controls Taiwan's largest heavy industry – the aluminum industry, the American Dorr-Oliver Company controls Taiwan's chemical fertilizer industry, Mobil Oil and Gulf Oil control Taiwan's petroleum industry, and General American Transportation Corporation controls Taiwan's shipbuilding industry. In the sugar and salt industries, American capital accounts for 60% of each. Taiwan's underground resources are also an important target of American monopoly capital's plunder. Many American engineers and experts are carrying out plans such as "exploring new mining areas," "developing gold and copper mines," "developing oilfields," and "developing basic resources" throughout Taiwan. Newspaper reports say, "American capital's control over Taiwan has reached an unshakable position."

    In order to maximize profits, American monopoly capital employs various barbaric means to exploit the Taiwanese people. The "electricity price increase case" in Taiwan in September 1954 is one example. The Taiwan Power Company, controlled by American capital, has repeatedly raised electricity prices over the years to exploit the Taiwanese people. The electricity price in January 1953 had already increased to 18 times that of May 1949. In 1954, the Taiwan Power Company once again proposed a plan to increase electricity prices, which was opposed by people of all strata in Taiwan. Brent, the director of the US Foreign Operations Administration's Taiwan branch, openly threatened Chiang Kai-shek, saying that only by increasing electricity prices could "increase the interest of foreign investors"; and before the electricity price was "fully adjusted," the United States could not but "temporarily postpone US aid." Disregarding the life and death of the people, Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan hurriedly passed the so-called "electricity price increase case," raising electricity prices by 36%. This electricity price increase added more than 70 million New Taiwan dollars to the burden of the Taiwanese people each year, and the electricity price increase further increased the rate of soaring prices in Taiwan. The imperialist crime of the US imperialism exploiting the Taiwanese people and plundering our country's rich resources in Taiwan has aroused strong hatred among the broad masses of the Taiwanese people.

### 美国资本控制台湾经济命脉

    美国资本控制台湾经济命脉
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国经济势力经由“美援”和私人投资的途径，侵入台湾，控制了台湾的经济命脉。
    据台湾报纸透露，美国在台湾的资本势力日益雄厚。消息说，从一九五一年到一九五四年，美国以“工建援助”名义向台湾工业部门侵入的资金共达两亿美元。其中所谓“工建计划”的投资，一九五四年比一九五一年增加了百分之六十一。这些“美援”资金的运用、支配，是在美国政府指定和美国官员监督下进行的。四年来，这些所谓“工建援助”的“美援”资金投入台湾电力工业的占了百分之二十七，投入肥料工业的占百分之二十，投入交通运输业的占百分之十六，其余百分之三十七投入台湾制糖、化学、金属、木材、纺织、渔业、电信、水泥等工业部门。美国垄断资本因此控制了台湾各主要工业部门。据报纸消息，美国怀特工程公司控制了台湾交通和建筑业，美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司控制了台湾电力工业，美国雷诺金属公司控制了台湾最大的重工业——铝工业，美国达道瑞安公司控制了台湾化学肥料工业，美孚石油公司和海湾石油公司控制了台湾石油业，通用美国运输公司控制了台湾造船业，在砂糖和制盐业中，美国资本各占了百分之六十。台湾的地下资源更是美国垄断资本掠夺的重要对象，许多美国工程人员和专家，正在台湾各地执行“探勘新矿区”“发展金铜矿”“开发石油矿”“基本资源开发”等计划。报纸消息说，“美国资本对台湾的统治已达牢不可拔的地位。”
    美国垄断资本为了追求最大限度的利润，采用各种野蛮手段剥削台湾人民。一九五四年九月间台湾的“电力加价案”，便是一例。美国资本控制的台湾电力公司，几年来一再提高电价剥削台湾人民。一九五三年一月的电价已增为一九四九年五月的十八倍。一九五四年，台湾电力公司又提出电力加价的计划，遭受到台湾各阶层人民的反对。美国援外事务管理署台湾分署署长布伦特竟公开要挟蒋贼说，唯有电力加价，才能“增高外人投资的兴趣”；而在电价没有“充分调整”以前，美国不能不把“美援暂时延搁”。蒋贼行政院便不顾人民死活，急忙通过了所谓“电力加价案”，把电费提高百分之三十六。这次电力加价，使台湾人民每年又要增加七千多万元伪台币的负担，并且电力加价以后加大了台湾物价暴涨的幅度。美帝国主义剥削台湾人民，掠夺我国台湾丰富的资源的侵略罪行，业已引起台湾广大人民强烈的仇恨。
