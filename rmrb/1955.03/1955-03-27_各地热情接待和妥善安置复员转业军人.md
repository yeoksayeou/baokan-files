Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: Governments and people in various locations warmly welcome demobilized and transferred military personnel, and have made proper arrangements for their housing and employment.

    When schools, organizations, and factories in Wuhan learned that some demobilized and transferred military personnel would be passing through the area, they immediately cleaned up housing and prepared tea. Many units, such as the Municipal Fourth Hospital, voluntarily vacated a large number of dormitories for the demobilized and transferred military personnel. Students from the Wuhan Geological School even organized special film, song, and dance evenings to welcome the demobilized and transferred military personnel. Party and government leading organs in Wuhan City gave the demobilized and transferred military personnel enthusiastic care and assistance, organizing special institutions to help them solve problems such as food, lodging, and transportation. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture specially dispatched a film projection team to screen films for the demobilized and transferred military personnel passing through. The city's water and land transportation departments also allocated dedicated vehicles and ships for the demobilized and transferred military personnel passing through.
    The vast majority of demobilized and transferred military personnel who have recently returned to Jiangsu Province have already found employment. Local people's governments have introduced them to the local production and work situation, encouraging them to play an active role in various positions. Eight counties, including Dafeng, have prepared more than 3,000 houses and 40,000 mu of land specifically to resettle homeless demobilized and transferred military personnel. The Third District of Xuzhou helped demobilized and transferred military personnel use the state-issued production subsidies to organize an iron factory, and dozens of people have now joined the production. In addition to introducing a group of demobilized and transferred military personnel to work in industrial and mining enterprises, organizations, and schools, Xin Hailian City also organized a variety of production teams to absorb them into production.
    Demobilized and transferred military personnel who returned to Fujian Province this year have also been properly resettled. After more than 20 homeless demobilized soldiers returned to counties such as Luoyuan and Minhou, the local governments and people immediately helped them settle down, and distributed land, farm tools, and furniture to them. Demobilized and transferred military personnel stated that they would respond to the government and people's care and assistance with active participation in production and construction.

    各地热情接待和妥善安置复员转业军人
    【新华社二十五日讯】各地政府和人民热情欢迎复员、转业军人，并对他们的居住、就业等问题做了妥善安置。
    武汉市很多学校、机关、工厂得到有些复员、转业军人要从当地路过的消息后，立刻为他们打扫了住房，准备了茶水。市立第四医院等很多单位自动给复员、转业军人们让出了大批宿舍。武汉地质学校学生还专门组织了电影及歌舞晚会欢迎复员、转业军人。武汉市党、政领导机关更给复员、转业军人以热忱关怀和帮助，组织了专门机构帮助复员、转业军人解决食宿、车船等问题。武汉市文化事业管理局专门派了一个电影放映队为过境的复员、转业军人放映电影。市的水陆运输部门也为过境的复员、转业军人们拨出了专用的车船。
    最近回到江苏省的复员、转业军人绝大部分已经就业。各地人民政府向他们介绍了当地的生产和工作情况，勉励他们在各个岗位上发挥积极作用。大丰等八个县共准备了三千多间房屋、四万多亩土地，专门安置无家的复员、转业军人。徐州市三区帮助复员、转业军人用国家发给他们的生产资助金组织了一个铁工厂，现在已有几十人参加了生产。新海连市除了介绍一批复员、转业军人到工矿企业、机关、学校工作外，还组织多种多样的生产小组吸收他们参加生产。
    今年回到福建省的复员、转业军人也已得到了妥善安置。罗源、闽侯等县二十多个无家的复员军人回来后，当地政府和人民立刻帮助他们安了家，并分配给他们土地、农具和家具。复员和转业的军人们表示，要以参加生产建设的积极行动来回答政府和人民对他们的关怀和帮助。
