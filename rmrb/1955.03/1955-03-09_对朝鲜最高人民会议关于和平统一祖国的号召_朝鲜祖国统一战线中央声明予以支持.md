Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. According to the Korean Central News Agency: The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea held a meeting on the 7th and adopted a statement supporting the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea's call for peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

The statement said: All Korean people who love their country and are concerned about its destiny unanimously demand the realization of this just call; the progressive public throughout the world also gives full support to this call, considering it an appropriate measure, the realization of which will help to ease the tension in the Far East and prevent the outbreak of another Korean war.

The statement pointed out: The US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique do not allow any consultation or reconciliation between North and South Korea to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, and have recently been carrying out their heinous war preparations even more frantically. The statement emphasized: The Syngman Rhee's sinister conspiracy to drive the Korean people into the abyss of war and destruction will never be allowed to succeed.

The statement went on to say: The rejection of the call of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by the US imperialists and the South Korean government authorities does not mean that the door to negotiations between North and South Korea is closed indefinitely. The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea will faithfully make efforts for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland; it declares that it has made all preparations, and if the South Korean National Assembly, political parties, social groups or people from all walks of life express their desire for negotiations between North and South Korea, it will respond at any time.
