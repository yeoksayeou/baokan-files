Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The "Freie Volkspresse" published in Düsseldorf, West Germany, published an article by Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, on the 7th, calling on the West German people, all political parties, trade unions and social organizations to support the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to hold a nationwide referendum in all of Germany. Reimann said that the Communist Party of Germany is ready to fight with anyone who opposes the Paris Accords and strives for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Reimann pointed out that the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic is in line with the will of people of all strata. The people welcome this proposal because they see in it the road to the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Reimann talked about the necessity of unified action by the working class. He said that the Communist Party of Germany once participated with the Social Democratic Party and the trade unions in the signature campaign for the "German Manifesto" in West Germany, and now should also jointly conduct the referendum to be held throughout Germany. Reimann said: There are enough examples in the history of the German workers' movement to show that if the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party act in unison, the reactionaries will be defeated. If the central committee of the Social Democratic Party and the leading organs of the trade unions avoid taking the road of extra-parliamentary struggle, it will bring great danger to the struggle against the Paris Accords.

In the article, Reimann pointed out to Erich Ollenhauer, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, that to continue to make anti-communist remarks in the current situation is a great danger to our people. We Communists are absolutely unwilling to see Social Democrats and Communists only recognize the necessity of joint struggle after experiencing concentration camps and exile. It is most urgent now that Social Democrats, Communists, Christians, and non-party workers unite.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Bonn dispatch: The President of the West German Bundestag, Gerstenmaier, issued a statement on the 6th rejecting the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to hold a nationwide referendum on the Paris Accords and the restoration of German unity.

Erich Ollenhauer, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, also rejected the proposal, although he recently said at a meeting of a leading body of the Social Democratic Party that the reunification of Germany into a free and peaceful country should still be resolved before rearmament and West Germany's accession to the Western military alliance; the Social Democratic Party will continue to hold protest rallies to oppose the implementation of the Paris Accords.

However, the West German people strongly oppose the Paris Accords and welcome the proposal to hold a nationwide referendum.

About 750 West German workers and trade union workers attended the All-German Workers' Conference held in Leipzig on March 5th. This conference was held under the slogan "The most urgent task is to hold a nationwide referendum." The participants, totaling about one thousand people, unanimously condemned the Bundestag's ratification of the Paris Accords and called on workers throughout Germany to take unified action to support the People's Chamber's proposal to hold a nationwide referendum.

Many members and organizations of the Social Democratic Party also welcome the proposal to hold a referendum. For example, a leader of the Social Democratic Party in Forst, Baden-Baden, North Baden, named Grisch, said: Every effort must be made to ensure that this proposal, which is conducive to easing international tensions, is accepted. Grisch believes that the result of the referendum will make rearmament impossible, because the German people will choose reunification.

Avalanches of letters from all corners and strata of residents are being sent to Ollenhauer, urging him to take active action against the Paris Accords.

    西德人民坚决要求在全德国举行人民投票
    【新华社柏林九日电】西德杜塞尔多夫出版的“自由人民报”七日发表德国共产党中央委员会第一书记马克斯·雷曼的文章，号召西德人民、各政党、工会和社会团体支持德意志民主共和国人民议院关于在全德国境内举行人民投票的建议。雷曼说，德国共产党准备同任何反对巴黎协定、争取德国和平统一的人一起斗争。
    雷曼指出，德意志民主共和国人民议院的建议是符合各阶层人民的意志的，人民欢迎这个建议，因为他们从这个建议中看到了德国和平统一的道路。
    雷曼谈到工人阶级统一行动的必要性，他说，德国共产党曾经同社会民主党和工会共同参加在西德进行过的“德国宣言”的签名运动，现在也应该共同进行在全德国举行的人民投票。雷曼说：在德国工人运动的历史上，有足够的例子说明，如果共产党和社会民主党一致行动，那么反动派就遭到失败。如果社会民主党中央和工会领导机关避免走上议会外斗争的道路，那将给反对巴黎协定的斗争带来很大的危险。
    雷曼在文章中向西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔指出，在现在的情势下还要说反共的话，这就是我国人民的巨大危险。我们共产党人决不愿意看到社会民主党员和共产党员要经过集中营和流亡才来认识到共同斗争的必要，社会民主党、共产党、基督教和无党派工人团结起来，是当前最紧要的事。
    【新华社八日讯】波恩消息：西德联邦议院主席格斯登美尔六日发表声明，拒绝接受德意志民主共和国人民议院提出的、就巴黎协定和恢复德国统一问题举行全德人民投票的建议。
    西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔也拒绝接受这个建议，虽然他最近在社会民主党的一次领导机构会议上说，把德国重新统一成为自由而和平的国家这一件事，仍然应该在重新武装和使西德加入西方军事联盟之前予以解决；社会民主党将继续举行抗议集会来反对实施巴黎协定。
    但是，西德人民强烈反对巴黎协定，欢迎在全德举行人民投票的建议。
    约七百五十名西德工人和工会工作者出席了三月五日在来比锡举行的全德工人会议，这个会议是在“最紧急的任务是举行全德人民投票”的口号下举行的。参加会议者约共一千人，他们一致谴责联邦议院批准巴黎协定，呼吁全德工人采取统一行动，支持人民议院关于举行全德人民投票的建议。
    社会民主党的许多党员和机构也欢迎举行人民投票的建议。例如，北巴登—巴登州弗斯特地方的社会民主党的一个领导人格里希说：必须尽一切努力使得这个有利于缓和国际紧张局势的建议被接受。格里希认为人民投票的结果会使重新武装成为不可能，因为德国人民将选择重新统一。
    雪片似的信件从各个角落和各阶层居民那里投寄给奥伦豪尔，催促他采取积极行动，反对巴黎协定。
