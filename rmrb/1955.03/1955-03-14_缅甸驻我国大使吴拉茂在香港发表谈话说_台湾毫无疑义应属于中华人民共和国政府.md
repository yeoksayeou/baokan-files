Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 11th: According to reports in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the 10th, U Hla Maung, the Ambassador of the Union of Burma to the People's Republic of China, arrived in Hong Kong from Burma on the 7th, en route back to Beijing. On the 9th, he gave a statement to reporters from the "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the situation in the Taiwan area and other issues.

    U Hla Maung said: "Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, which has been repeatedly affirmed by international agreements. Taiwan should of course belong to the government of the People's Republic of China, and there is absolutely no doubt about this."

    U Hla Maung said: "Burma's position on this matter has long been very clear. In the view of the Government of the Union of Burma, there is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. The Chiang Kai-shek 'government' in Taiwan does not exist."

    U Hla Maung also condemned the Manila Treaty Organization. He said: "Burma is opposed to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. We will never participate in any international organization whose purpose is to deal with a certain country or certain countries, especially organizations like the 'Southeast Asia Treaty Organization' that specifically include military treaties. This is completely unhelpful to peace and will not help solve problems. I see no benefit in it."

    U Hla Maung also talked about hydrogen weapons and atomic weapons. He said: "It should be clearly stated: we do not want atomic weapons, and we advocate that atomic energy should be developed to improve people's lives."

    缅甸驻我国大使吴拉茂在香港发表谈话说
    台湾毫无疑义应属于中华人民共和国政府
    【新华社广州十一日电】据香港“大公报”、“文汇报”十日报道：缅甸联邦驻中华人民共和国大使吴拉茂七日自缅甸抵达香港，转程回北京，九日曾就台湾地区局势等问题对“大公报”、“文汇报”记者发表了谈话。
    吴拉茂说：“台湾是中国领土的一部分，这是早经国际协定一再确认过的。台湾当然应该属于中华人民共和国政府，这是完全没有疑义的”。
    吴拉茂说：“缅甸对这件事的立场，早就很明确了。在缅甸联邦政府看来，中国只有一个，就是中华人民共和国，台湾的蒋介石‘政府’是不存在的。”
    吴拉茂又谴责了马尼拉条约集团。他说：“缅甸是反对东南亚条约组织的。我们决不愿参加任何目的在于对付某一个国家或某些国家的国际组织，尤其是像‘东南亚条约组织’这种特别包括有军事条约的组织。这是完全无助于和平的，也不会对解决问题有所帮助，我看不出它有任何好处。”
    吴拉茂还谈到氢武器和原子武器问题。他说：“应该明白的声明：我们不要原子武器，我们主张原子能应该向改进人民生活方面发展”。
