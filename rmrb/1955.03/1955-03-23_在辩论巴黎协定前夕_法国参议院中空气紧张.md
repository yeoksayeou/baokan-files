Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 20th: The date for the French Senate to debate the ratification of the Paris Agreements is approaching, and the atmosphere in the Senate is becoming increasingly tense.

Although the Senate's three committees, under pressure from the government and Washington and London, have expressed their support for ratifying the Paris Agreements without any modifications, serious differences of opinion on the Paris Agreements still exist.

The Social Republican parliamentary group is dissatisfied with the attitude of Michel Debre, the rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the Social Republican Party. Debre originally intended to propose an amendment to the ratification bill, but later he voted in favor of unconditional ratification. According to "Le Figaro," this parliamentary group discussed Debre's attitude at a meeting.

In a further attempt to ensure that the Senate passes the Paris Agreements without amendments, Foreign Minister Pinay told attendees at the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on the 18th that Adenauer had written to him, "guaranteeing to adhere to the provisions and spirit of the Saar Agreement." Pinay wanted to use this "guarantee" from Adenauer to make the parliamentarians feel as if there were no contradictions between France and West Germany on the Saar issue. This is despite the fact that just recently, Adenauer was clamoring to change the status of the Saar as stipulated in the Saar Agreement in the future.

Unease about the Saar Agreement is still quite prevalent among the parliamentarians. In the National Assembly, there is a force that wants the National Assembly to immediately re-discuss the Saar issue. Supporters of the Paris Agreements have not been able to reject the suggestion of re-discussing the Saar issue, but they firmly oppose holding it immediately, because they fear that doing so "might harm" the Senate's ratification. Faure proposed that the National Assembly discuss the Saar issue on March 30, that is, after the Senate votes on the Paris Agreements. This proposal was adopted by the General Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, but was rejected in the National Assembly by 299 votes to 268. The General Affairs Committee again tried to get the National Assembly to vote on a proposal with exactly the same content, namely to discuss the Saar issue on March 30. This second proposal passed in the National Assembly on the 18th with 287 votes against 282. The majority in this vote was only a slim five votes.

### 在辩论巴黎协定前夕  法国参议院中空气紧张

    在辩论巴黎协定前夕
    法国参议院中空气紧张
    【新华社二十日讯】巴黎消息：法国共和国参议院辩论关于批准巴黎协定的日期迫近，参议院中的气氛越来越紧张。
    虽然参议院的三个委员会在政府和华盛顿和伦敦的压力下表示赞成毫不加修改地批准巴黎协定，可是，对巴黎协定的分歧意见是严重存在着的。
    社会共和党党团不满意外交委员会的报告员、社会共和党党员密歇尔·德勃尔的态度。德勃尔本来打算对关于批准的法案提出一项修正案，可是后来他却投票赞成无条件批准。据“费加罗报”报道说，这个党团曾经在一次会议上讨论了德勃尔的态度问题。
    为了进一步设法使参议院不加修正地通过巴黎协定，外交部长比内在十八日的参议院外交委员会会议上向与会者说：阿登纳已经写信给他，“保证恪守萨尔协定的条文和精神”。比内想用阿登纳的这一个“保证”来使议员们觉得好像在萨尔问题上，法国同西德已经没有矛盾似的。虽然刚在不久以前，阿登纳还大嚷着要在将来改变萨尔协定中规定的萨尔的地位。
    议员中还是相当普遍地存在着对萨尔协定的不安情绪。在国民议会中，有一种力量想使国民议会立即重新讨论萨尔问题。巴黎协定的支持者没有能拒绝重新讨论萨尔问题的建议，但是却坚决反对马上举行，因为他们害怕这样做“可能损害”参议院的批准。富尔提出三月三十日，就是说在参议院表决了巴黎协定之后，再在国民议会中讨论萨尔问题。这个建议为国民议会总务委员会所采纳，但却在国民议会中以二百九十九票对二百六十八票被否决。总务委员会再度设法使国民议会表决一个内容完全相同的建议即在三月三十日讨论萨尔问题，这第二个建议在十八日国民议会表决时，以二百八十七票对二百八十二票获得通过。这次表决的多数只有微弱的五票。
