Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 15th: People from all walks of life in Lhasa warmly support the decisions and replies of the State Council's Seventh Plenary Session regarding various issues in Tibet. On the evenings of the 12th and 13th, many citizens and lamas from various places who came to participate in the Monlam Festival stood in front of loudspeakers or climbed onto rooftops to listen to the Tibetan broadcast of the State Council's decisions and two replies regarding the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. In some homes, people gathered around radios to listen. Some officials and Khenpos from monasteries visited each other after listening to the broadcast. The good news quickly spread throughout the streets and alleys of Lhasa. Dorje Phuntsog Rabgye, a Kalon of the Tibetan local government, recorded the content of the State Council's decision. He issued a written statement to reporters saying: "The State Council's decision once again proves that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people have obtained full national equality rights, and the motherland's big family is helping the Tibetan people gradually realize regional autonomy. From now on, the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Tibetan people will develop more rapidly and healthily. We must unite better and work hard to build the motherland and build a new Tibet." Wangde, the representative of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee's Lhasa Office, said: "I am particularly happy to hear the State Council's decision. These decisions will promote the development of Tibet's political and other undertakings, strengthen the connection and friendship between Tibet and the brotherly nationalities of the motherland, and promote internal unity and progress in Tibet."

The Living Buddha Phabala, Deputy Director of the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee, who came to Lhasa to participate in the Monlam Festival, said: "I fully support the State Council's decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, including the Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee, and the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee, so that we can further strengthen internal Tibetan unity and better carry out various constructions."

Tuden Tseren, Khenpo of Drepung Monastery, said: "The lamas who participated in the Monlam Festival listened excitedly to the State Council's decision. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a concrete implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy and a manifestation of the motherland's care for the monks and laypeople of Tibet. Further unity between the Dalai and Panchen sides is entirely in line with the wishes of the Tibetan people." Sangpo’s wife Yuzhen Zhuga, Vice Chairman of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, Sokang Kampus Ke Lang Wangjue, Vice Chairman of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Federation, and Tsedan Dorje, Mayor of Lhasa, said when talking about the "State Council's decision to help the Tibetan local government with construction matters": Millions of women, young people, and the broad masses of people in Tibet will be encouraged by this news. We must study hard, strengthen unity, and actively participate in the various constructions stipulated in the decision to build the motherland and Tibet even better. Tibetan workers at the Tibet Military Region's leather factory were particularly excited about the State Council's decision to establish a leather factory in Tibet. Female worker Zhaxi Lhamo said: With more well-equipped power plants and factories, the happiness of the Tibetan people will increase day by day. After hearing the good news, the family of Zhuma Yangzong, a citizen, talked excitedly until midnight.
