    This Time Our Cooperative Charter Is Solidly Established
    Wang Bao, Vice Chairman of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Suburbs of Kunming

    Our cooperative has drafted its charter three times. The first time was in 1953, when we simply translated a charter from another area into our own, read it to the members, and asked, "Does the first clause work for us?" Everyone said, "It works! It works!" We read through each clause, and that was considered the charter. The second time, we asked a working cadre to write it, without any discussion by the members. After it was written, it was posted on the wall, but later it was lost, and no one paid any attention to it. In 1954, our cooperative had expanded to ninety-three households. We encountered many issues, but we had no regulations to rely on, and it was very difficult to manage. We realized that the charter was an important tool for leading the cooperative well. In December, the Party members, Youth League members, and cadres in our cooperative first studied the draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives. During the study, some said, "Why bother with so much trouble? Just write something and read it!" In response to this idea, we explained the importance and purpose of drafting a charter to everyone. After studying, everyone gained some understanding of the importance of drafting a charter, but some understandings were not correct, and some had misunderstandings. Some members asked, "If we draft a charter, won't we lose freedom to work? What if we get stuck?" Cadres and activists said: "If we draft a good charter, it will be easier to manage the members, and we won't have to urge them to work one by one anymore. If they don't work on time, we can say, 'You drafted the charter yourselves, how can you not follow it?'" Later, we further publicized the content of the charter and the specific methods for drafting it. After discussion, 70% to 80% of the members requested a charter. Some said, "If we don't draft a charter, even the grass in front of the ox's mouth will be taken away and burned, and no one will take care of the broken waterwheels and manure buckets. We need to include clauses about protecting public property and observing labor discipline!" The content of the charter proposed by everyone was much more specific and practical than the first two drafts.

    During the charter drafting process, when policy issues were discussed, there were more ideological problems. Middle peasant Wang Youcai had an ox, a horse, and a waterwheel and manure bucket. After they were valued and contributed to the cooperative, he was afraid that the cooperative would not be able to repay the price. During the discussion, some members suggested using the public accumulation fund for repayment. However, our cooperative only had 15.2 million yuan (old currency) in public accumulation fund. In 1954, the cooperative had already used 14 million yuan (old currency) for basic construction. Some people said, "If we use the public accumulation fund for repayment, the cooperative will not be able to carry out basic construction, and it will be impossible to increase production!" We convened a Party group meeting to study the members' thoughts. At that time, those with more draught animals and farm tools were ideologically wavering. Because we had previously said that we would repay with the public accumulation fund, but we had not repaid it in two years, we had broken our word. After the Party group discussed it, it was decided that the draught animals and farm tools would be valued, and the cooperative would repay them in four years, with a portion counted as the member's personal share fund. Then, we convened a meeting of cooperative cadres and activists and told them the opinions discussed by the Party group, and they said it would work. We further explained it to the members and also explained it to the members with more draught animals and farm tools, and everyone agreed. The content of the charter was thus determined one by one.

    Handling specific issues involved a relatively intense ideological struggle. After the specific issues were discussed, everyone put forward twenty or thirty suggestions. We convened the cooperative cadres to sort out these suggestions. During the sorting process, we studied the policies and researched the content proposed by everyone. After six days, we drafted a charter consisting of twenty-seven articles. The main content included four items: first, a description of the nature of the cooperative; second, methods for handling some specific issues; third, operation and management; and fourth, inspection and implementation. After sorting it out, we studied it several times and then let everyone discuss it fully. Everyone said: This time the charter is solidly established, and we can act according to the rules!

    After the charter was drafted, the members all expressed that they would abide by it and not be like in the past, where it was "said in the mouth, posted on the wall." By drafting the charter, the members' concerns were dispelled. One member who originally did not want to contribute his waterwheel to the cooperative is now willing to do so. Everyone is also more protective of public property than before. The drafting of the charter has promoted production, and the members are actively planting spring crops. In order to complete the production increase task, everyone also borrowed two boats from outside, along with the four from the cooperative, to actively transport fertilizer. Everyone is also much better at following labor discipline than before. The production team leaders all said: In the past, we sometimes had to call at the members' homes twice to get them to work; after the charter was drafted, everyone automatically and actively participated in production. Before, when we asked the members, "What's good about joining the cooperative?" the members said, "It's good not to worry about anything!" Everyone didn't care about the cooperative. We had an old horse in our cooperative that gave birth to three foals. Because no one cared for them, both the foals and the old horse died. After the charter was drafted, the members said: It's not right to be like this anymore! Running the cooperative is not just the chairman's business, nor is it just the business of the management committee; it is the business of all the members. Everyone must cherish and care about the cooperative in order to run it well.

    Even after the charter is drafted, we cannot assume that there are no more problems with its implementation. The members are still very unaccustomed to complying with the charter. We will continue to organize everyone to study and improve it regularly, so that the charter can truly guide and promote the work of the entire cooperative.

### 我们的社章这回订扎实了

    我们的社章这回订扎实了
    昆明市郊区先锋农业生产合作社副社长　王保
    我们合作社订了三次社章。一九五三年订过一次，那一次是把外地的社章翻成我们的，念给社员听听，说：“第一条该合了？”大家说：“合了！合了！”逐条念过，就算订成了。第二次是请工作干部写的，没经过大家讨论；写出来以后贴在墙上，后来又失掉了，大家都对它不重视。一九五四年我们合作社已扩大到九十三户，碰到许多事情，没个章程做根据，很不好办，才认识到社章是领导办好社的一个重要东西。十二月间，我们社里的党员、团员、干部首先学习了农业生产合作社示范章程草案。在学习中，有的说：“何消这么麻烦？写写念念就行啦！”针对这种想法，我们向大家讲解了订社章的重要性，和订社章的目的。经过学习，大家对订社章的重要性有了一点认识，但有的认识还不够正确，有的还有误解。有的社员问：“订了社章出工就不自由啦，卡死掉怎么办？”干部和积极分子说：订好社章，就好管社员了，再出工也不要一家一家去催了；他们不按时出工，就说“社章是你们自己订的，怎个不照社章办事？”后来，我们又进一步宣传了社章的内容和订社章的具体办法。经过讨论，有百分之七十到百分之八十的社员要求订社章了。有的说：“再不订社章，牛嘴跟前的草也要被人拿去烧掉，水车、粪桶用坏也没有人管。要订上爱护公共财产，要订上遵守劳动纪律！”大家提出的社章内容比第一、二两次订的社章具体切实得多了。
    在订社章中讨论到政策问题时，思想问题又多了。中农王有才有一条牛、一匹马，还有水车、粪桶；折价入社后，怕社里还不起价款。讨论时，有的社员主张用公积金还。但我们社里只有旧币一千五百二十多万元的公积金，一九五四年社里基本建设已用了旧币一千四百多万元，有人说：“用公积金还，合作社就不能进行基本建设，再也无法增产了！”我们召开了党小组会，研究社员思想。当时耕畜、农具多的人思想动摇不定。因为以前我们说过用公积金还，但我们两年内没有还，说了白话。党小组商量以后，决定耕牛农具作价，由社四年还清，其中一部分算作社员个人的股份基金。接着召开了社干部和积极分子会议，把党小组商量的意见告诉他们，他们说行得通。我们进一步向社员作了交代，又对耕畜、农具多的社员作了解释，大家都同意了。社章内容就这样一条一条确定下来了。
    处理具体问题，思想斗争是比较激烈的。具体问题讨论后，大家提了 二、三十条意见。我们召集社干部整理这些意见。整理时，一面学习政策，一面研究大家提的内容。经过六天的时间，订出了包括二十七条的一个社章。主要内容有四项：第一是说明社的性质；第二是一些具体问题的处理办法；第三是经营管理；第四是检查执行。整理出来，又研究了几次，然后让大家充分讨论。大家说：这回订扎实了，可以照章办事啦！
    社章订好后，社员都表示要遵守，不能像过去那样“说在嘴上，贴在墙上”了。通过订社章，打消了社员的顾虑。有个社员原来有张水车不愿入社，现在也愿意入了。大家对公共财产也比以前更加爱护了。订社章推动了生产，社员们积极润小春。大家为了完成增产任务，还在外面借了两只船，连社里的共四只，积极运肥料。大家执行劳动纪律也比以前好得多了。生产小组长都说：以前上工有时候要到社员家叫两次；订了社章，大家都自动积极参加生产了。以前问社员：“入社哪点好？”社员说：“不消操心好！”大家都不关心社。我们社里原来有一匹老马，养了三个小马，大家不爱护，小马老马都死掉。订了社章以后，社员们说：再像这样就不对了！办社不光是社长的事，也不光是社务管理委员的事，是全体社员的事，大家要爱护社、关心社才能把社办好。
    订好了社章，不能就认为执行社章已经没有什么问题了。社员对于遵守社章还很不习惯，我们以后还要组织大家经常学习它、改进它，使社章真正起指导和推动全社工作的作用。
