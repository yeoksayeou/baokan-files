Pingxiang Coal Mine Sets Advanced Plan for This Year

Pingxiang Coal Mine, the largest coal mine in Jiangnan, has set a production plan for this year that exceeds its highest historical level. The mine began production in 1898 and has been operating for more than fifty years. After liberation, although it resumed and developed production, due to decades of severe damage, both Anyuan and Longhu mines successively ceased production, leading to a serious situation of small coalfields and limited reserves. Since the second half of 1953, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, the mine's employees have found more than a dozen large and small coalfields, which, based on this year's planned production level, can be mined for over 200 years.

This year, in formulating this year's plan, all the mine's employees criticized various conservative ideas and formulated an advanced plan, with the production plan exceeding the highest annual output in history.

Currently, the Anyuan Coal Mine is undergoing restoration and construction.

    萍乡煤矿今年订了先进计划
    江南最大的煤矿——萍乡煤矿今年的生产计划超过历史上最高水平。该矿在一八九八年即开始生产了，到现在已五十余年。解放后，它虽恢复和发展了生产，但由于几十年来严重的摧残，以致安源和龙虎两矿先后停止了生产，并且发生了煤田小和藏量不多的严重局面。一九五三年下半年以来该矿职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，已找到了大小煤田十余块，如按今年计划产量水平计算，可开采二百余年。
    今年，该矿全体职工在制订今年计划中，批判了各种保守思想，制订了先进计划，产量计划超过了历史最高年产量。
    目前，安源煤矿正在进行恢复建设。
