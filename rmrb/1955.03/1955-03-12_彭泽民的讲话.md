Chairman, respected colleagues, esteemed comrades:

The great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, has been gone from us for thirty years. Thirty years ago today, Mr. Sun passed away in Beijing. When I received this news at the time, I was extremely grief-stricken.

I knew Mr. Sun very early on and followed him in participating in the revolution. I knew that he was a great revolutionary, holding the aspiration to save the country and its people throughout his life. Although Mr. Sun suffered many setbacks and failures for the sake of national liberation and the people's interests, he always fought unyieldingly and never lost heart. In January 1924, when Mr. Sun was hosting a banquet for the representatives of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, he said: When abroad, "whenever I go to a place, I always meet many acquaintances. Those people always come and ask me, 'We see that you, sir, have failed countless times, why are you still not discouraged and always so enthusiastic? What is the reason for this?' Every time, I don't have any good answer, I only answer them like this: 'I don't care how many times the revolution has failed, but I always hope that the Chinese revolution will succeed, so I cannot help but continue to fight like this.'" Mr. Sun's spirit of persevering in revolutionary struggle is truly moving. Today, as we gather to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Mr. Sun's death, remembering this pioneer of the Chinese revolution, I think it is still very meaningful to reiterate this passage from Mr. Sun. His spirit of unremitting struggle for the country and the people is forever worthy of our good learning.

As a great democratic revolutionary, Mr. Sun diligently struggled throughout his life. In 1905, in order to change the fate of his country, he and other revolutionary comrades organized the Revolutionary Alliance, conducting a struggle against the Manchu Qing government. In October 1911, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction headed by Mr. Sun, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty and declaring the end of China's more than two thousand years of feudal imperial rule. After the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, he continued the struggle against the Northern Warlords. In 1924, with the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Sun reorganized the Kuomintang and put forward the slogans of opposing imperialism and opposing feudalism, formulating the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. Until his death, he continued to issue the call of "Peace, Struggle, Save China!"

Anyone who has been close to Mr. Sun knows that Mr. Sun was a humble, diligent, and constantly pursuing progressive revolutionary spirit. Mr. Sun's greatest advantage, in my experience, is that he can continuously progress with the changes of the times and objective things. It is precisely because Mr. Sun possessed this spirit of constantly pursuing progress that in his later years he was able to recognize from his years of struggle experience that the success of the revolution "must awaken the masses and unite with nations of the world that treat us equally, to fight together"; to develop the old Three People's Principles into the new Three People's Principles of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers; and to reorganize the Kuomintang and establish an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal alliance with the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Sun's contribution to the Chinese revolution in modern Chinese history and his spirit of continuous pursuit of progress will never be forgotten.

On the day before his death, Mr. Sun still kept the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers in mind. Here, I would like to cite a moving example: On the morning of March 11, Comrade He Xiangning went to see Mr. Sun. When Mr. Sun was signing his will, his hand was trembling, and after signing, he called out "Mrs. Liao Zhongkai" three times in a row, with tears streaming down his face. Comrade He Xiangning immediately realized that only the revolutionary spirit of Mr. Liao Zhongkai and Mr. Sun Yat-sen coincided, that is to say, the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers must be implemented. Therefore, Comrade He Xiangning could not help but burst into tears and said, "Sir, rest assured, we must implement the three major policies, even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, we will not forget, I am willing to fight to the end for the three major policies!" At that time, Mr. Sun, upon hearing these words, tightly held Comrade He Xiangning's hand and said, "I thank you." From this, it can be seen how much Mr. Sun cared about the implementation of the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers.

However, only two years after Mr. Sun's death, in 1927, when the Northern Expeditionary Revolutionary War jointly carried out by the Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party was moving towards victory, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries betrayed Mr. Sun's three major policies, colluded with imperialism, and embarked on the road of counter-revolution. In order to oppose this revolutionary betrayal by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, in order to expose the reactionary face of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, some of us formed an organization called the "Provisional Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang"—this organization later developed into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and fought against the Chiang bandit. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary clique scolded us as traitors to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and later, they conspired to murder Mr. Deng Yanda and many other comrades. History is the best witness, and the facts are already very clear: it is not others who have become traitors to Mr. Sun, but precisely the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary clique. Mr. Sun wanted to ally with the Soviet Union, but he wanted to oppose the Soviet Union and take refuge in American imperialism. Mr. Sun wanted to ally with the Communist Party, but he wanted to oppose the Communist Party and the people to the end. Mr. Sun wanted to assist the peasants and workers, but he wanted to trample the peasants and workers underfoot, oppressing and slaughtering the working people. If Mr. Sun knew in the afterlife, I think he would definitely not forgive this traitor. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor to the Chinese revolution, a traitor to Mr. Sun, and also the mortal enemy of our Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. We have an irreconcilable hatred with him. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen here, we guarantee that we will definitely, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang bandit, and we will never give up until we achieve our goal.

At the same time, we know that Mr. Sun, in his life, suffered many losses at the hands of imperialism. He hated imperialism. Therefore, in his later years, he came to a conclusion, believing that imperialism and warlords "these two things can never coexist with the welfare of our people." Regarding American imperialism, he said: "They have already suppressed the majority of people in this continent and country with a minority, and they are spreading that kind of poison to Asia to suppress our 900 million people, wanting the majority of our 900 million people to be slaves to their minority. This is truly very cruel, truly extremely hateful!" Now, American imperialism is arbitrarily and unreasonably interfering in our country's internal affairs, openly occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, attempting to expand its aggression in Asia, dreaming of making our 600 million Chinese people slaves to their minority. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun here, we can tell Mr. Sun with comfort that, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the era in which American imperialism attempted to make our 600 million Chinese people slaves to their minority has gone forever! We can say with full confidence that the dreams of American imperialism will never be realized. At the same time, we guarantee that we must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, unite more closely, further consolidate and strengthen our unbreakable friendship with our great ally, the Soviet Union, wage the most resolute struggle against the aggression of American imperialism, undertake the cause of defending peace, and carry it through to the end!

Comrades, it has been exactly thirty years since Mr. Sun's death. When Mr. Sun passed away, those of us were still in middle age. We remember very clearly what a dark society China was at that time. Now, thirty years have passed quickly. Today, as we stand in front of Mr. Sun's portrait, recalling the Chinese society during his lifetime, and looking at all the new emerging phenomena around us now, and the infinitely bright and happy prospects of our motherland, we old people cannot help but shed tears, and we cannot help but thank our leader—Chairman Mao—and our leading party—the Chinese Communist Party—from the bottom of our hearts. In order to commemorate Mr. Sun, I only have one sentence in the end: Forever follow Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and march towards socialism!

### 彭泽民的讲话

专栏：

    彭泽民的讲话主席、各位先生、各位同志：
    伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生，离开我们已经三十周年了。三十年前的今天，孙先生在北京逝世，当时我得到这个消息的时候，是异常悲痛的。
    我在很早的时候就认识孙先生，追随他参加革命，知道他是一个伟大的革命者，终生怀抱着救国救民的志愿。孙先生为了民族的解放和人民的利益，虽然遭受过不少的挫折和失败，但他总是不屈不挠的战斗，从不灰心。一九二四年一月，孙先生在欢宴中国国民党第一次全国代表大会代表的时候，曾说过这样的话：在国外“每到一个地方，总是遇到许多熟人，那些人总是来问我说：‘我们看到你这位先生，不知道失败过多少次了，为什么还不丧气，总是这么热心呢？这是什么理由呢？’我每次都没有什么好话可以答复，只有这样答复他们说：‘我不管革命失败了有多少次，但是我总要希望中国的革命成功，所以便不能不总是这样奋斗。’”孙先生的坚持革命斗争的精神，真是使人非常感动的。今天我们来开会纪念孙先生逝世三十周年，追怀这位中国革命的先行者，我想，重提孙先生的这一段话还是很有意义的。他的这种为国为民的奋斗不息的意志，永远值得我们好好地学习。
    作为一个伟大的民主主义革命家，孙先生辛勤地奋斗了一生。一九○五年，为了改变自己国家的命运，他和其他的一些革命同志组织了革命同盟会，进行了反对满清政府的斗争。一九一一年十月，在以孙先生为首的革命派的领导下爆发了辛亥革命，推翻了清朝的统治，宣告了中国两千多年来的封建帝制的结束。辛亥革命失败后，他又进行着反对北洋军阀的斗争。一九二四年，在苏联和中国共产党的帮助下，孙先生又改组国民党，提出了反对帝国主义和反对封建主义的口号，制定了联苏、联共、扶助工农三大政策。直到临终的时候，还不断发出了“和平，奋斗，救中国！”的呼声。
    凡是接近过孙先生的人，都知道孙先生是一个态度谦虚、勤于学习和具有不断追求进步的革命精神的人。孙先生最大的一个优点，我的体会是他能随着时代和客观事物的变化而不断进步。正是由于孙先生具备了这种不断追求进步的精神，所以在他的晚年才能从多年奋斗的经验中认识到革命的成功，“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”；才能把旧三民主义加以发展，成为联苏、联共、扶助工农三大政策的新三民主义；才能改组国民党并与中国共产党建立了反帝反封建的联盟。孙先生在中国近代史上对中国革命的贡献和他的不断追求进步的精神，是我们永远不会忘记的。
    在他逝世的前一天，孙先生还念念不忘联苏、联共、扶助工农的三大政策。在这里我愿意举出一个动人的例子：三月十一日上午，何香凝同志去看孙先生，当孙先生在遗嘱上签字时手已发颤，签完字后连续叫了三次“廖仲凯先生的夫人”，泪流满面。何香凝同志马上体会到唯有廖仲凯先生和孙中山先生的革命精神相吻合，就是说，必须实行联苏、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，所以，何香凝同志不禁痛哭失声地说：“先生放心，我们必须实行三大政策，海枯石烂，不会忘记，我愿为三大政策奋斗到底！”当时，孙先生听了这话就紧紧地握着何香凝同志的手说：“我谢谢你。”由此可见，孙先生是如何地关心着联苏、联共、扶助工农三大政策的实行。
    但是，孙先生逝世还不过两年，当一九二七年，中国国民党和中国共产党联合进行的北伐革命战争，正在走向胜利的时候，蒋介石反动派就背叛了孙先生的三大政策，和帝国主义勾结起来，走上反革命的道路。为了反对蒋介石反动派这种背叛革命的行为，为了揭露蒋介石卖国贼的反动面目，我们一部分人另外成立了一个“中国国民党临时行动委员会”的组织——这个组织后来发展成为中国农工民主党，和蒋贼进行斗争。当时，蒋介石反革命集团骂我们这些人是孙中山先生的叛徒，后来，并阴谋杀害了邓演达先生和其他的许多同志。历史是最好的证人，事实已经很清楚，做了孙先生叛徒的不是别人，正是蒋介石反革命集团。孙先生要联苏，他却要反苏，并投靠美帝国主义，孙先生要联共，他却要反共反人民到底，孙先生要扶助工农，他却要把工农踩在脚下，压迫和屠杀劳动人民。孙先生地下有知，我想，是一定不会饶恕这个卖国贼的。蒋介石卖国贼是中国革命的叛徒，是孙先生的叛徒，也是我们中国农工民主党的死敌，我们和他有不共戴天的仇恨。今天，我们在这里纪念孙中山先生，我们保证，一定要在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，坚决解放台湾，消灭蒋贼，不达目的，决不罢休。
    同时，我们知道，孙先生在他的一生中，是吃过很多次帝国主义的亏的。他痛恨帝国主义，因此，在他晚年的时候，就作出了一个结论，认为帝国主义和军阀“这两个东西和我们人民的福利是永远不能并立的。”对于美帝国主义，他说过这样的话：“他们用少数人既已压制了本洲和本国的多数人，更把那种流毒推广到亚洲，来压制我们九万万民族，要我们九万万的大多数，做他们少数人的奴隶。这真是非常残酷，真是可恶已极！”现在，美帝国主义正在横蛮无理地干涉我国的内政，公开地霸占我国的领土台湾，企图扩大它在亚洲的侵略，梦想着要我们六亿中国人民做他们少数人的奴隶。今天我们在这里纪念孙先生，我们可以告慰孙先生的是：由于有了毛主席和中国共产党的领导，美帝国主义企图要我们六亿中国人民做他们少数人的奴隶的时代，已经永远一去不复返了！我们可以信心百倍地这样说：美帝国主义的梦想是永远不会实现的。同时，我们保证，我们一定要在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，更紧密地团结起来，进一步巩固和加强我们和伟大盟邦苏联之间的牢不可破的友谊，对美帝国主义的侵略进行最坚决的斗争，把保卫和平的事业担当起来，并进行到底！
    各位同志，从孙先生逝世到今天，已经整整三十周年了。孙先生逝世的时候，我们这一辈的人还正在中年，当时的中国是一个怎样黑暗的社会，我们这些人是记得很清楚的。现在，三十年已经很快地过去了，今天我们站在孙先生的遗像的面前回忆一下他在世时的中国的社会，再看一看现在周围的一切新生的气象，和我们祖国无限光明幸福的前景，我们这些老年人真不禁热泪盈眶，我们不得不从心坎里感谢我们的领袖——毛主席和我们的领导党——中国共产党。为了纪念孙先生，最后我只有一句话：永远跟着毛主席和中国共产党走，走向社会主义！
