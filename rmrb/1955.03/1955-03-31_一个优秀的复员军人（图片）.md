An Excellent Demobilized Soldier
Liao Jinsheng, a demobilized soldier from Shipan Township, Meixian County, Guangdong Province, is a glorious Communist Party member who has been recognized for his meritorious service in combat and is also a model in demobilized production.

Liao Jinsheng had been awarded four minor merits in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was awarded a third-class merit for his participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. After returning to his hometown in September 1953, he has always maintained the fine traditions of hardship and simplicity of a revolutionary soldier. Under the leadership and assistance of the local Party branch, he actively carried out the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the work of unified purchase and sale. Due to his outstanding achievements, he was awarded one first-class merit and one third-class merit and was awarded the title of Model Demobilized Soldier. Now, Liao Jinsheng has been elected as the deputy secretary of the Shipan Township Party branch, the head of the mutual aid joint group, a member of the township government, a representative of the township and district people, and the chairman of the township armed forces committee.

Liao Jinsheng's exemplary actions have not only educated the broad masses of local farmers but have also inspired his comrades-in-arms in the army. In February of this year, Liao Jinsheng was invited by the army to report to his long-separated comrades-in-arms on the situation of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, enabling the soldiers to more vividly and specifically understand the great significance of the state's implementation of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    一个优秀的复员军人
    广东省梅县石盘乡复员军人廖金盛，是一个在战斗中立过功劳，在复员生产中又是模范的一位光荣的共产党员。
    廖金盛曾在中国人民解放军某部立过四次小功，在参加抗美援朝的斗争中又立了一次三等功。一九五三年九月复员回乡后，他一直保持着革命军人艰苦、朴实的优良传统，在当地党支部的领导和帮助下，积极开展互助合作运动和统购统销的工作，由于成绩优异，又立了一个一等功和一个三等功，并获得了模范复员军人的称号。现在，廖金盛已当选为石盘乡党的支部副书记、互助联组组长、乡政府委员、乡和区的人民代表、乡武装委员会主席。
    廖金盛的模范行动不仅教育了当地广大农民群众，而且也鼓舞了部队的战友们。今年二月，廖金盛应部队的邀请，向久别的战友们报告了农村互助合作运动的情况，使战士们更生动而具体地认识到国家对农业实行社会主义改造的重要意义。　杜海振　任宝正　摄影
