　　Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th: According to TASS, since the electrical workers and machine workers in London's newspaper printing plants began their strike on the 25th, ten of London's most influential morning newspapers, three evening newspapers, and eleven Sunday newspapers have been unable to publish. Reuters said that this is the largest strike in the British printing industry since 1926.
　　The strike is due to the newspaper owners' refusal to agree to the workers' demands for wage increases. According to Reuters, negotiations between the strike committee, newspaper owners, and representatives of the Labor Ministry's arbitration committee have yielded no results. A spokesman for the striking workers said on the 27th that they do not accept the conditions proposed by the newspaper owners and will continue the struggle until all their demands are met.

    伦敦各报印厂工人坚持罢工
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：从二十五日伦敦各报纸印刷厂的电气工人和机器工人开始罢工以后，伦敦十家最有影响的晨报，三家晚报和十一家星期日报纸一直没有能出版。路透社说，这是一九二六年以来英国印刷业工人最大的一次罢工。
    罢工是由于报馆老板拒绝答应工人增加工资的要求。路透社的消息说，罢工委员会、报馆老板以及劳工部仲裁委员会的代表们之间的谈判毫无结果。罢工工人们的发言人二十七日说，他们不接受报馆老板提出的条件，他们将继续斗争到所有的要求获得满足为止。
