    Sun Yat-sen – A Great Chinese Democratic Revolutionary Activist
    Miao Chuhuang
    Today marks the thirtieth anniversary of the death of Sun Yat-sen, a great democratic revolutionary activist in modern China. In the past thirty years, China has undergone earth-shaking changes. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong pursuits, which he did not realize, have now been fully realized and greatly advanced. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have not only achieved a great victory in the people's democratic revolution but are also carrying out large-scale economic construction and socialist transformation, struggling to build a socialist society without exploitation and poverty. Today, as the Chinese people are engaged in the great cause of socialist construction, they cannot help but sincerely cherish the memory of all revolutionary patriots of the past hundred years, especially Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese democratic revolution.
    Sun Yat-sen was born on November 12, 1866, in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County, Guangdong Province (now Zhongshan County). At that time, it was just after the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, and the reactionary and corrupt Manchu Qing government, unable to resist the invasion of foreign capitalism, was causing China to sink step by step into the abyss of a semi-colony. As early as his childhood, Sun Yat-sen longed for the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, which had shaken the whole country, because he was dissatisfied with the tyranny and corruption of the Manchu Qing officials. Later, he went to foreign schools in Honolulu, Hong Kong, and other places, where he came into contact with bourgeois democratic ideas, which deepened his dissatisfaction with the Manchu Qing rule. In 1892, Sun Yat-sen graduated from Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, and practiced medicine in Macau and Guangzhou. At this time, he began his political activities. Before 1894, his political activities were basically within the scope of reformism. In 1894, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he went from China to Honolulu again and established the first political group he led – the Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society). Later, the Manchu Qing government was defeated and forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan in 1895, which, in addition to ceding territory and paying reparations, also allowed Japanese merchants to open factories in China. The degree of China's colonization deepened. As the national crisis became increasingly serious and the Manchu Qing government stubbornly refused to reform, the Xingzhonghui, led by Sun Yat-sen, put forward the revolutionary slogan of "Expelling the Tartars, restoring China, and establishing a united government," and decided to expand its organization to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places, and unite with the folk secret societies of the time – the Triads – to prepare for the first armed uprising in Guangzhou. This uprising failed under the suppression of the Manchu Qing government, and Sun Yat-sen was forced to flee to Japan and the United States, and then to Britain. From this time until 1898, Sun Yat-sen was in extremely difficult circumstances. The Manchu Qing government tried every means to capture and kill him, and once lured him into the Chinese embassy in London and imprisoned him. At that time, the general public, who had not yet awakened, also regarded him as a "rebellious subject, a heinous traitor," and dared not approach him. But he was not discouraged, and continued to carry out activities to contact revolutionary comrades everywhere, and to investigate the political customs of European countries, trying to find the truth to save China. There, he came into contact with the European socialist movement, which strengthened his democratic beliefs, and he also included social reformist elements in his revolutionary thought. This period of investigation had a great influence on the development of Sun Yat-sen's thought.
    In 1900, the armies of eight imperialist countries – Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, Russia, France, Italy, and Austria – occupied the ruling center of the Manchu Qing government – Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. The Manchu Qing government's army not only did not resolutely resist, but colluded with the invaders to suppress the Boxers who spontaneously rose up to resist the invasion. This created an increasingly serious situation. People knew that it was impossible to expect the Manchu Qing government to reform automatically or to resist foreign invaders. Thus, anti-Manchu Qing revolutionary groups were organized in various places, and patriotic ideas against the Manchu Qing rule and democratic ideas against the autocratic system gradually became popular. Many petty-bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals went abroad to study in order to find the truth to save the country. They came into contact with the revolutionary organizations led by Sun Yat-sen abroad. Later, many of them actively supported Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary propositions. However, the reformists, led by Kang Youwei, who had fled abroad at that time, still advocated a constitutional monarchy and carried out anti-revolutionary activities among overseas Chinese and students studying abroad. The revolutionary faction under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen launched a resolute ideological struggle against them. This struggle drew a clear line between the revolutionary faction and the reformist faction, enabling the revolutionary faction to develop further.
    In 1905, the first people's revolution of the era of imperialism broke out in Russia. The Russian Revolution gave important encouragement to many revolutionaries in China. The movement against the Manchu Qing government in various parts of China developed, and local revolutionary groups became increasingly active. This situation raised a task that urgently needed to be solved, that is, to unify the activities of revolutionary groups and revolutionary elements in various places in order to strengthen the revolutionary forces. In August of the same year, Sun Yat-sen united revolutionary elements from seventeen provinces of China and established a national revolutionary organization – the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) – in Tokyo, Japan. Sun Yat-sen was elected as the Premier of the Tongmenghui. His revolutionary democratic program – "Expelling the Tartars, restoring China, establishing a republic, and equalizing land ownership" – became the program of the Tongmenghui. This was also the essence of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood) at that time.
    After the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the Chinese bourgeois revolutionary movement developed widely. A large number of members of the Tongmenghui returned to China and went deep into the Triads and the Manchu Qing government's New Army to carry out activities. In less than a year, branches of the Tongmenghui were generally established throughout the country, with more than 10,000 participants. They launched many armed uprisings in various places. Although these uprisings failed, the revolutionary influence expanded. On October 10, 1911, under the influence of the revolutionary faction in Hubei, soldiers inclined to revolution finally victoriously launched an uprising in Wuchang. Then, the provinces responded one after another, and the revolutionary torrent quickly swept across the country. This was the Xinhai Revolution. The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the rule of the Manchu Qing government, ended the feudal autocratic system that had lasted for more than two thousand years in China, created the Republic of China, formulated a provisional constitution with the nature of a bourgeois republic, and elected a parliament based on this constitution. Sun Yat-sen was elected as the Provisional President.
    The Tongmenghui and other revolutionary groups led by Sun Yat-sen relied on the strength of the Triads and the New Army to achieve the victory of the Xinhai Revolution. However, in the process of revolutionary victory and development, the Tongmenghui did not widely develop and organize the strength of the people's masses, especially the peasant masses, on which it could rely. Therefore, they did not dare to put forward a thorough program against imperialism, but repeatedly declared that they would retain the vested interests and privileges of imperialism in China, and even fantasized that imperialism would assist the Chinese revolution. Similarly, they did not dare to put forward a thorough program against feudalism, and did not dare to link the slogan of "equalizing land ownership" with the peasants' land demands, but maintained the feudal order in various places, and even allowed feudal forces to manipulate the revolutionary regimes established in various places after the Wuchang Uprising. Furthermore, although the revolutionary faction had fought against the reformist faction for a long time, it did not completely distinguish between the constitutional monarchists and the democratic revolutionaries, so that many constitutional monarchists squeezed into the revolutionary ranks, which was also a major weakness of the Xinhai Revolution. Because of this, the Tongmenghui, headed by Sun Yat-sen, not only did not receive the support of the broad masses of the people, but became isolated in the process of revolutionary development. As a result, in 1912, Sun Yat-sen had to give up the position of Provisional President to Yuan Shikai, who, with the support of imperialism and feudal forces, rose up to steal the fruits of the revolution. The Xinhai Revolution had actually failed by this point. Soon, the revolutionary Tongmenghui was also mixed with many bureaucratic politicians and renamed the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party).
    Following Yuan Shikai's counter-revolutionary conspiracy in 1913, the emerging warlord forces continued to trample on all democratic facilities, the Provisional Constitution continued to be discarded, and the parliament elected under the Constitution continued to be dissolved. "Republic of China" had become an empty signboard without substance. China's situation was getting worse and worse. The imperialist countries supported various factions of warlords in China to engage in civil wars year after year, plunging China into a state of extreme chaos. Under such circumstances, the revolutionary faction led by Sun Yat-sen again carried out struggles against Yuan Shikai and the succeeding warlord forces. Although they made many efforts, they all failed.
      One failure after another forced Sun Yat-sen to doubt the bourgeois democratic system and to reconsider the methods of revolution and who were the friends and enemies of the revolution.
    It was in such a period that great revolutionary changes took place in China and the world. In 1917, the great October Socialist Revolution broke out in Russia, creating the first socialist country in the world. The victory of the October Socialist Revolution aroused a wave of enthusiasm among the Chinese people for learning Marxism-Leninism. In 1919, the "May Fourth" Movement, in which the broad masses of the people participated, took place in China, and the Chinese working class began to become an independent political force. In 1921, the political party of the Chinese working class armed with Marxism-Leninism – the Chinese Communist Party – was established. The Chinese Communist Party put forward a program of thorough opposition to imperialism and feudalism, launched a high tide of the national workers' movement, and proposed to Sun Yat-sen the establishment of a revolutionary united front. Thus, Sun Yat-sen, who was trapped in extremely difficult circumstances, received new hope. He warmly welcomed the October Revolution, believing that: "Our party's future revolution, if not taking Russia as a teacher, will have no success." He warmly agreed with the program put forward by the Communists against imperialism and feudalism and the proposal to establish a revolutionary united front. In 1923, with the help of the Communists, the Chinese Kuomintang began to reorganize into a revolutionary alliance including the working class, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie. The First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, which was held in Guangzhou in 1924 with the participation of Communists, realized this reorganization and determined the policies of allying with the Soviet Union, allying with the Communist Party, and supporting the worker-peasant movement. In the declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, Sun Yat-sen reinterpreted his Three Principles of the People. Sun Yat-sen's reinterpreted Three Principles of the People, namely the New Three Principles of the People, was the political basis for the cooperation between the Communists and the Kuomintang. After the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang, Sun Yat-sen got rid of the state of being isolated and helpless in the anti-warlord struggle after the Xinhai Revolution. With the help of the Soviet Union and the Communists, and with the support of the workers and peasants, he founded the Huangpu Military Academy, suppressed the rebellion of the armed merchant corps of the comprador class in Guangzhou, which was instigated by imperialism, prepared for the Northern Expedition, and finally went to Beijing in the winter of 1924 to promote the convening of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties. By this point, the revolutionary influence had spread from South China to North China.
    On March 12, 1925, the great democratic revolutionary activist Sun Yat-sen passed away in Beijing. On his deathbed, he still warmly called for uniting with the Soviet Union and mobilizing the masses. The Chinese people will always remember the immortal conclusion he wrote in his will based on forty years of revolutionary experience: To achieve the victory of the revolution, "we must awaken the masses and unite with those nations in the world that treat us as equals to fight together." When Comrade Mao Zedong mentioned this point in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in 1949, he said: "Sun Yat-sen and we have different worldviews and observe and deal with problems from different class standpoints, but in the 1920s, on the issue of how to fight against imperialism, we reached such a fundamentally consistent conclusion."
    Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to the unyielding struggle for the independence, democracy, and prosperity of his motherland. But after Sun Yat-sen's death, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, who called themselves "disciples of Sun Yat-sen," completely betrayed Sun Yat-sen's teachings, frantically opposed the Soviet Union, opposed communism, and opposed the people. As a result, they dragged China into an abyss of suffering and also dragged themselves to a dead end. Finally, their reactionary rule was overthrown by the Chinese people. Today, the remnant gang of Chiang Kai-shek, who are still entrenched in Taiwan, continue to do evil, selling the sacred territory of Taiwan to American imperialism, and resolutely opposing the liberated Chinese people and their leader, the Chinese Communist Party. This small handful of traitors will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the struggle of the people of the motherland to liberate Taiwan. Therefore, we believe that all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democrats must learn a lesson from this: If they are truly passionate about revolution, they must resolutely stand on the side of the democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, sincerely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, stand on the same front with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and unequivocally draw a line with imperialism, otherwise, they will go to a dead end. We also want to solemnly warn all those who have lost themselves in Taiwan and blindly follow the Chiang Kai-shek traitors who betrayed Sun Yat-sen's teachings: you should open your eyes and see today's China and the world, rein in at the precipice, abandon the darkness and turn to the light, and stop lingering on the dead end.

    孙中山——中国伟大的民主主义革命活动家
    缪楚黄
    今天是近代中国伟大的民主主义革命活动家孙中山逝世三十周年。三十年来，中国发生了一个翻天覆地的变化。孙中山毕生追求而没有实现的理想，现在已经完全实现了，并且把它大大地向前推进了。中国人民在中国共产党领导下，不仅取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利，而且正在进行大规模的经济建设和社会主义改造，为建立没有剥削和贫困的社会主义社会而斗争。中国人民在从事伟大社会主义建设事业的今天，不能不衷心地追怀一百多年来的一切革命志士，尤其是中国民主主义革命的先驱者孙中山。
    孙中山于一八六六年十一月十二日生于广东省香山县（今中山县）翠亨村。那时，正当太平天国革命失败之后，反动和腐朽的满清政府，抵不住外国资本主义的侵略，使中国一步步地陷进半殖民地的深渊。孙中山早在他的童年时期，就因为不满满清官吏的横暴和腐败而向往着曾经震撼全国的太平天国革命。后来，他到檀香山、香港等地的外国学校读书，接触到资产阶级民主主义的思想，更加深了对满清统治的不满。一八九二年，孙中山毕业于香港雅丽医学院，并先后在澳门和广州行医。这时，他开始了政治活动。在一八九四年前，他的政治活动基本上属于改良主义的范围。一八九四年中日战争爆发时，他又由国内到了檀香山，并在那里建立了他所领导的第一个政治团体——兴中会。后来，满清政府战败，于一八九五年被迫与日本签订了“马关条约”，除了割地赔款以外，还允许日商在中国开设工厂。中国的殖民地化的程度更加深了。在民族危机日益严重和满清政府顽固地拒绝改革的情况下，孙中山所领导的兴中会提出了“驱逐鞑虏，恢复中华，创立合众政府”的革命主张，决定把组织扩展到香港、广州等地，并联合当时的民间秘密结社——会党，准备在广州举行第一次武装起义。这次起义在满清政府的镇压下失败了，孙中山被迫先后逃亡日本和美国，继又转赴英国。从这时起，一直到一八九八年，孙中山处在极端困苦的境地中。满清政府用尽各种手段企图捕杀他，并一度把他诱进驻伦敦的中国公使馆幽禁起来。当时一般尚未觉醒的人们，也把他看做“乱臣贼子，大逆不道”，不敢和他接近。但他没有灰心，仍然到处进行联络革命同志的活动，并考察欧洲各国的政治风俗，企图寻找救中国的真理。在那里，他接触到的欧洲社会主义运动，坚定了他的民主信念，他并且把社会改良主义成分也包含到他的革命思想中。这段考察对孙中山思想的发展，曾经起了很大的影响。
    一九○○年，英、美、德、日、俄、法、意、奥等八个帝国主义国家的军队侵占了满清政府的统治中心——天津、北京以及其他地方。满清政府的军队不但不坚决地予以抵抗，反而勾结侵略者镇压自发地起来反抗侵略的义和团。这就造成了一个越来越严重的局势。人们知道，指望满清政府自动地改良，指望它抵抗外国侵略者是不可能的了。于是反对满清政府的革命小团体在各地纷纷组织起来，反抗满清统治的爱国思想和反对专制制度的民主思想渐渐普及起来。许多小资产阶级和资产阶级的知识分子，为了寻找救国的真理，纷纷到国外去留学。他们在国外接触到了孙中山领导的革命组织。后来有许多人都积极拥护了孙中山的革命主张。但是，当时逃亡国外的以康有为为首的改良派，仍然主张君主立宪，并在华侨和留学生中进行反对革命的活动。孙中山领导下的革命派对他们展开了坚决的思想斗争。这一斗争使革命派同改良派划清了界限，使革命派获得进一步的发展。
    一九○五年，俄国爆发了帝国主义时代第一次人民革命。俄国革命给予中国的许多革命者以重要的鼓舞。中国各地反抗满清政府的运动日益发展，地方性的革命小团体日益活跃。这种情况提出了一个迫切要求解决的任务，就是要统一各地革命小团体和革命分子的活动，以加强革命的力量。同年八月，孙中山联合中国十七个省的革命分子，在日本东京成立了一个全国性的革命团体——中国同盟会。孙中山被选为中国同盟会的总理。他的革命民主主义纲领——“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”，成为中国同盟会的纲领。这也就是当时孙中山的三民主义（民族主义、民权主义、民生主义）学说的要点。
    中国同盟会成立后，中国资产阶级革命运动有了广泛发展。中国同盟会的大批会员回国，深入到会党和满清政府的新军中去活动。不到一年，中国同盟会的支部在全国普遍建立，参加者达一万多人。他们先后在各地发动了多次武装起义。这些起义虽然都失败了，但革命影响日益扩大。到一九一一年十月十日，在湖北革命派影响下，倾向革命的士兵终于胜利地在武昌发动了起义。接着，各省纷纷响应，革命的洪流，迅速地涌向全国。这就是辛亥革命。辛亥革命推翻了满清政府的统治，结束了中国两千多年的封建君主的专制制度，产生了中华民国，制定了具有资产阶级共和国宪法性质的临时约法，并根据这个约法选出了国会。孙中山被选为临时大总统。
    孙中山所领导的中国同盟会以及其他革命团体，依靠会党和新军这些群众的力量，取得了辛亥革命的胜利。但是在革命胜利发展的过程中，中国同盟会却没有广泛地发展和组织可以依靠的人民大众的力量，特别是农民群众的力量。因此，他们就不敢提出彻底的反对帝国主义的纲领，反而一再地声明保留帝国主义在华的既得利益和特权，甚至幻想帝国主义会援助中国革命。同样，他们也不敢提出彻底的反对封建主义的纲领，不敢把“平均地权”的口号与农民的土地要求联系起来，反而维持各地的封建秩序，甚至让封建势力操纵武昌起义以后在各地建立起来的革命政权。再者，革命派虽长期同改良派进行了斗争，可是没有彻底区别开君主立宪派和民主革命派，以致有许多君主立宪派挤进革命队伍来，这也是辛亥革命的一大弱点。正因为这样，以孙中山为首的中国同盟会不但没有得到广大群众的支持，反而在革命发展过程中孤立起来了。结果，在一九一二年，孙中山不得不把临时大总统的职位让给在帝国主义和封建势力支持下起来盗窃革命果实的袁世凯。辛亥革命至此实际上已经失败了。不久，革命的中国同盟会也混进许多官僚政客，改名为国民党。
    继一九一三年袁世凯策动的反革命阴谋之后，后起的军阀势力继续蹂躏一切民主设施，临时约法继续被毁弃，根据约法选举出来的国会继续被解散，“中华民国”已成为名不副实的空招牌。中国的情况越来越坏，帝国主义国家支持中国的各派军阀连年不断地进行内战，使中国陷入极端混乱的状态。在这样的情况下，孙中山所领导的革命派，又进行了反对袁世凯及继起的军阀势力的斗争。虽然他们经过许多努力，但都失败了。
      一次又一次的失败，迫使孙中山不能不怀疑资产阶级的民主制度，不能不重新考虑革命的方法和谁是革命的朋友，谁是革命的敌人。
    正是在这样的时期，中国和世界发生了革命的大变化。一九一七年俄国爆发了伟大的十月社会主义革命，创立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。十月社会主义革命的胜利，引起了中国人学习马克思列宁主义的热潮。一九一九年在中国发生了有广大群众参加的“五四”运动，中国工人阶级开始成为一个独立的政治力量。一九二一年，以马克思列宁主义武装起来的中国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党成立。中国共产党提出了彻底反对帝国主义和封建主义的纲领，发动了全国工人运动的高潮，并向孙中山提出了建立革命统一战线的建议。于是陷在极端困难的境地里的孙中山得到了新希望。他热烈地欢迎十月革命，认为：“我党今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就”。他热烈地赞同共产党人提出的反对帝国主义、封建主义的纲领和建立革命统一战线的建议。一九二三年，在共产党人的帮助下，中国国民党开始改组为包括工人阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的革命联盟。一九二四年在广州召开的有共产党人参加的中国国民党第一次全国代表大会实现了这一改组，并确定了联合苏联、联合共产党和发展工农运动的政策。孙中山在中国国民党第一次全国代表大会的宣言中重新解释了他的三民主义。孙中山的这种重新解释过的三民主义即新三民主义是共产党人和国民党合作的政治基础。中国国民党改组以后，孙中山摆脱了辛亥革命以后在反军阀斗争当中孤立无援的状态。他在苏联、共产党人的帮助和工农群众的支援下，创办了黄埔军官学校，镇压了帝国主义策动的广州买办阶级的武装商团的叛乱，准备了北伐战争，最后并在一九二四年冬天，亲赴北京，宣传召开国民会议和废除不平等条约的主张。至此，革命的影响从华南扩展到了华北。
    一九二五年三月十二日，伟大的民主主义革命活动家孙中山在北京逝世了。在临终时，他仍然热烈地号召联合苏联和发动群众。中国人民将永远地记得他根据四十年的革命经验，最后在遗嘱上所写下的不朽的结论：要取得革命的胜利，“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”。一九四九年毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”一文中提到这一点时，曾说过：“孙中山和我们具有各不相同的宇宙观，从不同的阶级立场出发去观察和处理问题，但在二十世纪二十年代，在怎样和帝国主义作斗争的问题上，却和我们达到了这样一个基本上一致的结论。”
    孙中山献出了他的一生，为追求祖国的独立、民主和富强作了百折不挠的斗争。但在孙中山逝世以后，自称为“孙中山信徒”的蒋介石匪帮，却完全背叛了孙中山的遗教，疯狂地反苏反共反人民，结果，把中国拖向了苦痛的深渊，同时也把他们自己拖向了绝路，最后，他们的反动统治，终于被中国人民推翻了。今天，还盘踞在台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮继续作恶，把祖国的神圣领土台湾出卖给美帝国主义，坚决地与获得了解放的中国人民及其领导者中国共产党为敌。这一小撮卖国贼在祖国人民解放台湾的斗争中必然会遭到可耻的失败。因此，我们认为一切资产阶级和小资产阶级的民主主义者必须从这里得到教训：如果真正怀有革命的热诚，就必须坚决地站在以苏联为首的民主与社会主义阵营的一边，诚心地接受中国共产党的领导，和广大的工农群众站在一条战线上，毫不含糊地和帝国主义划清界限，否则，就会走向绝路。我们还要正告一切失身在台湾，盲目跟着背叛孙中山遗教的蒋介石卖国贼走的人们：你们应当睁开眼睛来看看今天的中国和世界，悬崖勒马，弃暗投明，不要再在绝路上停留了。（附图片）
