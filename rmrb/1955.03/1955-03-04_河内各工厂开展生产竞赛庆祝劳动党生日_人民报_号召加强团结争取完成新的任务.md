    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd:  To commemorate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party on March 3rd, factories and government offices in Hanoi have launched a large-scale competition in production and work.  According to the plan, this competition will end in early May.
    To promote this competition, all factories in Hanoi held meetings on the 3rd.  The Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party also sent representatives to meet with workers from the railway, water company, and power plant on the 3rd.  The representatives reported on the achievements made by the people of Hanoi last year.
    According to the "People's Daily," Hanoi workers had already launched short-term competitions before the 3rd to welcome the Party's birthday. The Gia Lam Train Repair Factory fully completed the competition plan before the opening of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway. Workers at the Hubin Substation saved more than 3,500 work hours and raw materials worth 5.18 million Vietnamese dong from January 1st to February 28th.  Workers in the water company and power plant also actively improved production efficiency.
    The competition that started on the 3rd will further advance the movement to increase production and practice economy in Hanoi factories.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: March 3rd marks the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party.  The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "Unify Thought, Strengthen Internal Unity, and Resolutely Struggle to Complete New Tasks."
    The editorial said: "March 3rd is a day of great historical significance.  It marks a great victory for the Vietnamese working class and working people, as well as all Vietnamese people, on the revolutionary struggle path to achieve national independence, realize people's democracy, and move towards socialism."
    The Vietnam Workers' Party was founded in the fifth year of the Patriotic War. It applied Marxism-Leninism to the practice of the Vietnamese revolution and led the Vietnamese people's armed struggle to victory.
    The editorial pointed out: "Today, peace has been restored, and this is the first time we commemorate the founding of the Party in peace. In the new situation and environment, our Party has analyzed the situation based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism and timely put forward tasks such as political struggle, economic recovery, and consolidation of national defense during peacetime."
    As pointed out in the resolution of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee in September 1954, the Party's tasks in the coming period are: to unite and lead the people to implement the armistice agreement, be vigilant and thwart all conspiracies to sabotage the agreement, accelerate the completion of land reform, restore and improve production, and strengthen the construction of the People's Army, so as to consolidate peace, achieve reunification, and complete national independence and democracy.
    We have achieved great victories in implementing the Party's new tasks and new policies, especially in taking over vast areas including most of the Northern Vietnamese plains, including the capital Hanoi.  We have also made fairly good achievements in other aspects.
    The editorial then pointed out: "However, now the US imperialists and the French colonialists and their lackeys who oppose the armistice agreement are stepping up their efforts to sabotage the armistice agreement, sabotage peace, and undermine Vietnam's unity and independence."
    In the past, the US imperialists' conspiracy to prolong and expand the war has been defeated. Today, they are conspiring to drag South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, blatantly interfere in the internal affairs of the Indochinese countries, and attempt to directly control the military, turning South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into US military bases and colonies in order to prepare for a new war in the Far East. Under this situation, the task of the entire Party, army, and the people is to be vigilant at all times and be prepared to smash all the enemy's vicious conspiracies.
    After emphasizing the importance of ideological unity and close unity within the Party under the new situation, the editorial pointed out: "Commemorating the Party's birthday, all our comrades must work hard to study and grasp the Party's policies, organize and lead the broad masses to implement the Party's policies. Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the political struggle and economic recovery cause of the people throughout the country to consolidate peace, achieve reunification, and complete national independence and democracy, although long and arduous, will surely be victorious."

    河内各工厂开展生产竞赛庆祝劳动党生日
    “人民报”号召加强团结争取完成新的任务
    【新华社河内三日电】在三月三日—越南劳动党诞生四周年纪念日，河内各工厂、机关开始了一个大规模的生产和工作中的竞赛运动。按照计划，这个竞赛运动将在五月上旬结束。
    为了开展这个竞赛运动，河内各工厂三日都举行了大会。越南劳动党河内市委员会并且派出代表在三日和铁路工人、自来水公司和发电厂的工人见面。代表们在会上报告了河内人民在去年所取得的成绩。
    据“人民报”报道说，河内工人在三日以前已经开展了短期竞赛运动来迎接党的生日。嘉林火车修理厂全部完成了河内—睦南关铁路通车前的竞赛计划，湖滨变电所工人自一月一日到二月二十八日止，共节约了三千五百多工时和价值五百一十八万元（越币）的原材料；自来水公司、发电厂的工人也都积极提高了生产效率。
    在三日开始的竞赛运动将把河内各工厂的增产节约运动更向前推进一步。
    【新华社河内三日电】三月三日在越南劳动党成立四周年纪念日。越南“人民报”为此发表了社论，题目是“统一思想，团结内部，为完成新的任务而坚决奋斗。”
    社论说：三月三日这一天是有着重大历史意义的，它标志着越南工人阶级和劳动人民以及全体越南人民为了争取民族独立、实现人民民主和走向社会主义的革命斗争道路上的一个伟大的胜利。
    越南劳动党是在爱国战争进入第五年时宣布成立的，它把马克思—列宁主义应用到越南革命的实践中去，并且领导越南人民的武装斗争走向胜利。
    社论指出：今天，和平已经恢复了，这是第一次在和平中纪念党的成立。在新的形势和新的环境下，我们党根据马克思—列宁主义的理论分析了形势，适时地提出了在和平时期的政治斗争、恢复经济和巩固国防等任务。
    正如一九五四年九月党中央政治局的决议所指出的，党在今后一个时期中的任务是：团结和领导人民为实现停战协定，警惕和粉碎一切破坏协定的阴谋，加紧完成土地改革，恢复和提高生产，加强建设人民军，以巩固和平、实现统一，完成全国独立和民主而斗争。
    我们实现党的新任务和新政策已经取得了巨大的胜利，特别是接管了包括大部分北越平原其中有首都河内在内的广大地区。在其它方面也取得了相当好的成绩。
    社论接着指出：但是，现在美帝国主义和反对停战协定的法国殖民分子及其走狗，仍正在加紧破坏停战协定、破坏和平、破坏越南的统一和独立。
    过去，美帝国主义企图延长和扩大战争的阴谋已经遭到失败。今天他们正在阴谋把南越、柬埔寨和老挝拖入东南亚侵略集团，露骨地干涉印度支那各国的内政，企图直接掌握军队，把南越、柬埔寨和老挝变成美国的军事基地和殖民地，以便准备远东的新战争。在这个形势下，全党、全军和全国人民的任务是随时警惕和准备粉碎敌人的一切恶毒阴谋。
    社论在强调党内的思想统一和紧密团结新的形势下的重要意义后指出：纪念党的生日，我们全体同志必须努力学习和掌握党的政策，组织和领导广大群众执行党的政策。在马克思—列宁主义的旗帜下，在党和胡志明主席的领导下，全国人民为巩固和平、实现统一和完成全国的独立和民主而进行的政治斗争和经济恢复事业，虽然长期和艰苦，但是一定能取得胜利。
