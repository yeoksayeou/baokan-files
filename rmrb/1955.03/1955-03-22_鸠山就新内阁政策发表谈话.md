Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, after forming his second cabinet, gave a statement to reporters on the 19th regarding the new cabinet's policies.

Hatoyama Ichiro stated that he would strive to fulfill the promises he made during the election one by one, and would make the "utmost effort" to restore Japan's trade and diplomatic relations with peaceful and democratic countries. However, he said that this would be carried out without harming the "friendship" between Japan and the United States. He also stated that he would dispatch a private envoy to Washington to explain his policy of improving relations with China and the Soviet Union to the United States. On the same day, Hatoyama's Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu stated that the "basic spirit" of the new cabinet's foreign policy was to "maintain coordination" with the United States and other capitalist countries, and "on this basis, seek the normalization of Japanese-Soviet relations."

In his statement, Hatoyama Ichiro emphasized that his cabinet was a "minority independent cabinet," and therefore he would strive for the "cooperation" of opposition parties in the Diet in the future.

According to Tokyo sources: Well-informed sources pointed out that Hatoyama's inaugural statement was made after the strength of the opposition parties was strongly demonstrated, and this strength was already threatening the stability of his new government.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: According to TASS from Karachi: Japanese diplomatic representatives stationed in twenty-two countries in the Asian and Pacific region held a three-day meeting here, which closed on the 18th. Well-informed sources pointed out that Japanese diplomats intend to adopt a "new approach" to foreign policy, the purpose of which is to establish closer relations with Asian countries, especially in economic terms.

Senior officials from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a special trip from Tokyo to explain this "new approach" to the participants.

    鸠山就新内阁政策发表谈话
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎在组成第二次内阁后，十九日就新内阁的政策向记者发表谈话。
    鸠山一郎表示要努力逐一实现他在竞选时所作的诺言，要尽“最大努力”来恢复日本同和平民主国家的贸易和外交关系，但是他说这要在不损害日美“友谊”的情况下进行，他还表示将派遣一个私人特使到华盛顿去，向美国解释他的同中国、苏联改善关系的政策。同日，鸠山内阁外相重光葵表示新内阁的外交方针“基本精神”是同美国及各资本主义国家“保持协调”，并“在这个基础上求得日苏关系的正常化。”
    鸠山一郎在谈话中强调他的内阁是一个“少数单独内阁”，因此今后要在国会中争取在野党派的“合作”。
    据东京消息：灵通人士指出鸠山的就任谈话是在反对党派的力量强烈表现出来之后发表的，这种力量已在威胁着他的新政府的稳定。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩讯：驻在二十二个亚洲和太平洋地区国家的日本外交代表在这里举行了历时三天的会议，会议已在十八日闭幕。消息灵通人士指出，日本外交官打算采取外交政策的“新方针”，这个“新方针”的目的是要同亚洲国家建立较密切的关系，特别是在经济方面的关系。
      日本外务省的高级官员特地从东京赶来，向参加会议的人解释了这个“新方针”。
