    Da Dianzi Village Has Not Had a Forest Fire for Five Years
    Da Dianzi Village in the Sixth District of Huanren County, Liaoning Province, is surrounded by dense natural hardwood forests. Because the people of Da Dianzi Village value forest protection and fire prevention work, there has not been a single forest fire in the past five years.
    The fact that they have not had a single forest fire in five years is inseparable from the village leadership's emphasis on fire prevention work. Wang Wenkui, the secretary of the village's Communist Party branch, and Jin Xian'en, the village head, not only publicize the importance of forest protection and fire prevention at various mass meetings, but also hold village forest protection and fire prevention work meetings every spring and autumn fire prevention period to discuss how to carry out forest protection and fire prevention work, and make fire prevention work plans. Village cadres often go deep into various fire prevention groups or use loudspeakers and blackboards to publicize to the masses the benefits of protecting forests for national industrial construction and for the masses themselves, thereby increasing the masses' enthusiasm for forest protection and fire prevention. Therefore, the masses in the village consciously refrain from smoking or making fires in the wild, using fire to illuminate frogs, or using smoke to fumigate wild animals. When the masses go into the mountains to engage in sideline production, village cadres are also responsible for organizing and leading them. For example, before entering the mountains, they must organize a sideline production team, select a team leader, and propose a guarantee that they will not make fire or damage the forest in the mountains. Then, the village government will issue a certificate to enter the mountains before they can enter the mountains.
    The village also took the initiative to demarcate fire prevention boundaries with several surrounding villages, and signed a "mutual prevention and mutual rescue" fire prevention covenant, which promoted the masses in other villages to also pay attention to forest protection and fire prevention.

    大甸子村五年没有发生山火
    辽宁省桓仁县第六区大甸子村的周围生长着稠密的天然杂木林，由于大甸子村群众重视护林防火工作，五年来没有发生过一次山林火灾。
    他们五年未发生一次山火，是和村的领导重视防火工作分不开的。中共村支部书记王文奎和村长金显恩，除平时在各种群众会上宣传护林防火的重要意义外，每到春秋两季防火戒严期，还召开村的护林防火工作会议，讨论如何开展护林防火工作，并作出防火工作计划。村干部经常深入各防火小组或通过广播筒、黑板报，向群众宣传保护森林对国家工业建设和对群众本身的好处，提高群众护林防火的积极性。因此，该村群众都自觉地不在野外吸烟、烤火，不用火照蛤蟆，不用烟熏野兽。群众进山搞副业生产时，村干部也负责组织领导，如在入山前一定组织好副业生产小组，选出小组长，并提出保证不在山上弄火和破坏山林，然后由村政府发给入山证明才能入山。
    这个村还主动与周围几个村子划清了防火界限，订立了“互防、互救”的防火公约，推动了其他村的群众也注意护林防火。
