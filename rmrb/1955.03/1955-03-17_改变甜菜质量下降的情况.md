    Changing the Situation of Declining Sugar Beet Quality
    By Our Reporter Jin Yukun
    In 1954, Heilongjiang Province generally achieved a bumper harvest of sugar beets, but half of the sugar factories in the province failed to complete the state's production plan, and most sugar factories also failed to meet their financial cost plans. Sugar factories' failure to complete the state plan is certainly due to some management shortcomings, but the main factor is the poor quality of the sugar beets.
    The quality of sugar beets and the level of sugar content directly affect the production of sugar factories. If the sugar content of sugar beets in Heilongjiang Province were increased by just one percent, it could increase the country's wealth by 55.1 billion yuan in old currency. In 1954, the sugar content of sugar beets in Heilongjiang Province not only did not increase, but generally decreased by one to two percent compared to 1953. According to preliminary estimates, this resulted in a reduction of more than 11,000 tons of sugar produced by sugar factories throughout the province, reducing the state's income by more than 100 billion yuan in old currency (more than the total annual profit submitted). Due to the decrease in output, the cost of sugar factories relatively increased. At the same time, due to the low sugar content of sugar beets, the amount of raw materials processed had to be increased, which caused an imbalance in production between various sections of the factory. Although the work plans for processing raw materials in sugar factories throughout the province were largely completed and overfulfilled, the overall sugar production plan was not completed.
    Sugar beets have been grown in Heilongjiang Province for thirty to forty years. After liberation, the state actively mobilized farmers to plant sugar beets in large quantities, appropriately opened up new planting areas, and the county and district governments in the planting areas gradually strengthened their leadership over sugar beet planting, thus ensuring a sufficient supply of raw materials needed for the province's sugar industry. However, because sugar beets are a relatively complex economic crop with technical requirements, and in the past few years, their planting has mainly been carried out by scattered farmers on small plots of land, it has been difficult to implement the necessary technical measures. For example, the methods of deep plowing and close planting have not been implemented in most areas, fertilization cannot meet the needs of the land, crop rotation systems cannot be seriously implemented (farmers, because of the high income from planting sugar beets, often plant them every two years instead of the required four-year rotation), and diseases and insect pests are becoming increasingly serious. All of these have led to a downward trend in the quality of sugar beets. Before liberation, the highest sugar content of sugar beets was 18 percent, and generally it could reach 16 to 17 percent, but in recent years the general sugar content of sugar beets is only about 15 percent, and in some planting areas the sugar content of sugar beets is only 10 to 13 percent. The sugar content of sugar beets in these areas has been decreasing by almost one percent every year.
    The backward small-scale peasant economy is certainly an objective reason that hinders the rapid change of the backwardness of sugar beet production, but this cannot deny the serious shortcomings that exist in the leadership of sugar beet planting work. For a long time, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture only had two cadres in the special products section responsible for managing sugar beet production work, and the technical guidance for sugar beet planting mainly relied on the individual sugar factories. Obviously, this is far from enough. In 1954, although sugar beet technology extension stations were established in various counties, they played a very small role due to the weak allocation of cadres.
    The decline in sugar beet quality is also related to the purchasing price policy. Heilongjiang Province's purchase of sugar beets is priced by weight, which has created a phenomenon among farmers of simply pursuing quantity. For example, some farmers only pay attention to using nitrogen fertilizer to increase the weight of sugar beets, resulting in an increase in sugar beet yield, but a decrease in quality.
    The potential for sugar beet production in Heilongjiang Province is very large. This can be seen from the comparison between the advanced and backward areas of sugar beet production in the province. For example, the sugar content of sugar beets in the Nehe area is as high as 18 percent, while in backward areas it is only about 13 percent. The high-yield households in the Nehe area can achieve a sugar beet yield of 36 tons per hectare, and the experimental farm of the state-owned Hongguang Sugar Factory can also achieve a sugar beet yield of 23 tons per hectare with slightly more careful cultivation, but the current general yield is only about 12 tons. Party committees and agricultural departments at all levels in Heilongjiang Province should learn from the serious lessons of the failure of sugar factory plans due to the decline in sugar beet quality in 1954, and while paying attention to leading the increase in grain production, they should also gradually improve the quality and yield of sugar beets, and put the improvement of sugar beet production work in its proper important position.

    改变甜菜质量下降的情况
    本报记者　金雨困
    一九五四年黑龙江省甜菜普遍获得了丰收，但全省半数制糖厂却没有完成国家的产量计划，大部分糖厂的财务成本计划也落了空。糖厂不能完成国家计划，管理上固然存在着一些缺点，但主要的因素却是甜菜质量的低劣。
    甜菜质量的优劣，含糖率的高低，都直接影响到制糖厂的生产。只要黑龙江省全省的甜菜含糖率提高百分之一，就可以为国家增加财富旧币五百五十一亿元。一九五四年黑龙江省的甜菜，不仅没有提高含糖率，而且较一九五三年普遍下降了百分之一到二。据初步估计，全省糖厂因此而减产的糖要达一万一千多吨，减少国家的收入合旧币一千余亿元（比全年上缴的利润数字还大）。由于产量减少，糖厂的成本就相对地提高了。同时由于甜菜含糖率低，原料的处理量就不得不增加，这样就造成了厂内各个工段之间的生产不均衡现象，全省糖厂的原料的加工量的作业计划虽已大部完成和超额完成了，但总的产糖计划却没有完成。
    黑龙江省种植甜菜已有三四十年的历史。解放后，国家曾积极发动农民大量种植甜菜，适当地开辟了新的种植区，种植区的县、区政府也逐步加强了对甜菜种植的领导，因而保证了本省制糖工业所需原料的充分供应。但由于甜菜是技术要求比较复杂的经济作物，过去几年，它的种植又主要是由分散的农户在小块的土地上进行的，必需的技术措施很难贯彻。例如，大部地区对深耕密植的方法没有贯彻，施肥不能适应土地的需要，轮耕制不能认真执行（农民因种甜菜收益大，本来应四年轮种的，往往隔两年就种上了），病虫害日益严重。这些都使得甜菜质量发生了下降的趋势。解放前，甜菜含糖率最高达百分之十八，一般也可达到百分之十六到十七，但近年来甜菜一般的含糖率只有百分之十五左右，有的种植区甜菜含糖率只有百分之十到十三，这些地区的甜菜含糖率差不多每年都要下降百分之一。
    落后的小农经济固是妨碍迅速改变甜菜生产落后的客观原因，但并不能因此就否认在甜菜种植工作领导方面存在的严重缺点。长久以来，黑龙江省农业厅仅有特产科的两个干部，负责管理甜菜生产工作，甜菜种植的技术指导主要依赖各糖厂分别进行，显然，这样是很不够的。一九五四年虽在各县建立了甜菜技术推广站，但由于干部配备过弱，发挥作用很小。
    甜菜质量的降低和收购价格政策也是有关的。黑龙江省收购甜菜是以重量计价，这样就在农民中造成了单纯追求数量的现象，如有的农民只注意多用增加甜菜重量的氮肥，结果甜菜产量是增加了，而质量却下降了。
    黑龙江省甜菜生产的潜力是很大的。这从省内甜菜生产的先进区和落后区的比较上就可以看出来。如讷河地区的甜菜含糖率高达百分之十八，而落后地区仅达百分之十三左右。讷河地区的丰产户每公顷地甜菜产量可达三十六吨，国营红光糖厂的试验场在耕作上稍为细致一点，甜菜产量也达到每公顷二十三吨，但目前一般的产量仅能达到十二吨左右。黑龙江省各级党委和农业部门应该吸取一九五四年因甜菜质量下降而使糖厂计划落空的严重教训，在注意领导粮食增产的同时，也应该逐步提高甜菜的质量和产量，把改善甜菜生产工作放到应有的重要地位上来。
