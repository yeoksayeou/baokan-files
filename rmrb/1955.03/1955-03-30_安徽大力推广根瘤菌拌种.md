Anhui Province has decided to promote rhizobium inoculation on ten million mu of soybeans this year, including three million mu using "soybean rhizobium inoculum" and seven million mu using "root products" made from spring soybeans cultivated by farmers. It will also promote peanut rhizobium inoculation on 200,000 mu. The soybean inoculant is now being cultivated by the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, and the peanut inoculant powder has also been entrusted to the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute for cultivation. Both can be distributed to farmers in the near future. Experience in cultivating rhizobium in the past has proven that cultivating rhizobium is a good way to spend less money, achieve greater results, and increase soil fertility. Generally, in soybean stubble fields that have been cultivated with rhizobium, not only can less fertilizer be applied when sowing bean crops to obtain high yields, but also other crops can grow well when sown.

    安徽大力推广根瘤菌拌种
    安徽省今年决定推广大豆根瘤菌拌种一千万亩，其中用“大豆根瘤接种剂”拌种的三百万亩，用农民栽培的春大豆制“根制品”接种的七百万亩。并推广花生根瘤菌接种二十万亩。现在大豆的拌种剂已由省农业试验总站进行培制，拌种花生的菌粉也已委托华北农业科学研究所代为培制，短期内都可分配到农民手里。根据过去培养根瘤菌的经验证明，培养根瘤菌是花钱少、收效大、增加土地肥力的好办法。一般培养过根瘤菌的豆茬地里，不仅播种豆类作物可以少上肥料，得到高产，就是播种其他作物也能生长良好。
