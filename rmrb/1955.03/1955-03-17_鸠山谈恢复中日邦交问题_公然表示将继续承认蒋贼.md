Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama held a press conference in Tokyo on the 14th, discussing issues such as the relationship between Japan and China.

Hatoyama told reporters that he was willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union and China on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations, and stated that he "hoped to maintain friendly relations with all neighboring countries on a regular basis." However, Hatoyama also stated that his government would still "continue to recognize" the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group in Taiwan, and insisted that "in fact, there are two Chinas." In this way, Hatoyama made it clear that he would continue to support the US policy of occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and his so-called talks about restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations were nothing more than a tactic to perfunctorily address the strong desire of the Japanese people to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Hatoyama emphasized that in terms of restoring normal relations between Japan and China, he focused on trade relations. But he also said: "For the time being, I do not expect a large amount of trade with Communist China." Then, he immediately reassured the American ruling group, which was trying its best to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade, that the United States "need not feel uneasy about this issue."

Hatoyama used many words to express that his foreign policy was a "peaceful" policy, but he also said that it was "unavoidable" for the United States to store atomic bombs in Japan, and even openly stated that the US military "can use bases in Japan" when conducting wars.

Regarding the issue of Japanese rearmament, Hatoyama mentioned that the Japanese people hate war and that Japan's economic strength cannot afford the expansion of military expenditures. But he emphasized: "I have not given up hope of revising the constitution. I intend to revise the constitution when I obtain more than two-thirds of the seats in the (House of Representatives) in the future" in order to "strengthen Japan's national power as the United States hopes."

    鸠山谈恢复中日邦交问题
    公然表示将继续承认蒋贼
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎十四日在东京举行记者招待会，谈到日本和中国的关系等问题。
    鸠山向记者表示愿意同苏联和中国谈判恢复邦交的问题，并且表示“希望同各邻邦经常保持友好关系”，但是鸠山同时又表示他的政府仍然要“继续承认”台湾蒋贼集团，并且硬说什么“事实上是存在着两个中国”。这样，鸠山就表明了他将继续支持美国侵占中国领土台湾的政策，而他所谓关于恢复中日邦交的谈话不过是用来敷衍日本人民要求恢复中日邦交的强烈愿望的一种手法而已。
    鸠山强调：在日本和中国恢复正常关系方面，他着重的是贸易关系。但是他又说：“暂时，我不期望同共产党中国有大量的贸易。”接着，他又马上宽慰竭力阻挠中日贸易正常化的美国统治集团说，美国“大可不必为这个问题而感到不安”。
    鸠山用了许多话来表白他的外交政策是“和平”政策，但是他又说美国在日本贮存原子弹是“不可避免的”，甚至公然表示美国军队在进行战争时“可以使用在日本的基地”。
    关于日本重新武装问题，鸠山提到日本人民痛恨战争，而且日本的经济力量担负不起军事费用的膨胀。但是他强调说：“我并没有放弃要修改宪法的希望。我打算在将来获得（众议院）三分之二以上的议席时，一定要修改宪法，”以便“像美国所希望的那样，增强日本的国家力量。”
