In order to cultivate worker-peasant intellectuals needed for the country's large-scale construction, national worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools have seen significant development in the past five years.

At present, there are 87 worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools nationwide, with 51,000 students, more than ten times the number of students in 1950. Worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools have already had two graduating classes, the vast majority of whom have been admitted to universities and colleges. Of the 1,680 graduates in 1953, 1,622 were admitted to universities and colleges; of the 4,187 graduates in 1954, 3,297 were admitted to universities and colleges. Most of these students admitted to universities and colleges can keep up with the classes. According to statistics from 88 universities and colleges, of the 1,186 graduates of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools admitted to these schools in 1953, 962 were promoted to the next grade after one year of study, accounting for more than 81% of the total. The completion of enrollment plans for worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools has also improved year by year. For example, in 1953, the plan was to enroll more than 11,000 students, and 96% was completed; in 1954, the plan was to enroll more than 30,000 students, and more than 97% was completed. The proportion of industrial workers among the students has increased year by year: 14% in 1952, 33% in 1953, and 40% in 1954. The educational level of the students has also improved year by year. Taking the worker-peasant accelerated secondary school attached to the Renmin University of China as an example, the proportion of students with a cultural level of higher primary school graduation or above was 20% in 1950, 40% in 1951, 85% in 1952, 93% in 1953, and 96% in 1954. The situation in most schools across the country is similar.

    全国工农速成中学有了显著发展
    为了培养国家大规模建设所需要的工农知识分子，五年以来，全国工农速成中学有了显著发展。
    目前全国共有工农速成中学八十七校，在校学生五万一千人，较一九五○年学生数增加了十倍多。工农速成中学已经有两届毕业生，绝大多数都升入了高等学校。一九五三年毕业生一千六百八十人，升入高等学校的一千六百二十二人；一九五四年毕业生四千一百八十七人，升入高等学校的三千二百九十七人。这些升入高等学校的学生多数都能跟班学习，根据八十八个高等学校的统计，一九五三年工农速成中学毕业生升入各该校的共一千一百八十六人，学习一年后升级的九百六十二人，占总人数的百分之八十一以上。工农速成中学完成招生计划的情况也逐年进步。如一九五三年计划招生一万一千多人，完成百分之九十六；一九五四年计划招生三万多人，完成百分之九十七多。学生中产业工人比例逐年增加了：一九五二年为百分之十四，一九五三年为百分之三十三，一九五四年为百分之四十。学生的文化程度也逐年提高。以中国人民大学附设工农速成中学为例，所收学生够高小毕业以上程度的，一九五○年为百分之二十，一九五一年为百分之四十，一九五二年为百分之八十五，一九五三年为百分之九十三，一九五四年为百分之九十六。全国大多数学校情况也是这样的。
