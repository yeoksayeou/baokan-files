    Lhasa Holds the Great Prayer Festival
    The Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa officially began on February 26th. Monks from the three major monasteries of Lhasa have all arrived in the city, and lamas, farmers, and herdsmen from various regions have also come to participate one after another. In the early morning, the Jokhang Temple in the city center was crowded inside and out with lamas gathering for prayers and people making pilgrimages.
    On the afternoon of the 25th, tens of thousands of monks and laypeople listened to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's speech at the New Year's banquet on the Tibetan calendar, as well as the speeches of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni on the radio. The joint office composed of representatives from the three major monasteries, the Tibetan local government, and the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Tibet Regional People's Committee for Opposing the Use of Atomic Weapons, decided to hold radio broadcasts and photo exhibitions on opposing the use of atomic weapons, liberating Taiwan, and Sino-Soviet friendship during the Great Prayer Festival, and to distribute propaganda materials such as the Dalai Lama's and the Panchen Erdeni's speeches at the First National People's Congress, and the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World." The responsible Khenpos of the various monasteries presiding over the Great Prayer Festival have decided to launch a publicity campaign to collect signatures against the use of atomic weapons during the Great Prayer Festival and to chant peace sutras. The Lhasa People's Hospital has prepared a large quantity of smallpox vaccine and has begun vaccinating the monks and laypeople participating in the Great Prayer Festival.
    Before the start of the Great Prayer Festival, the floating population of Lhasa increased, but thanks to the continuous transport of goods from the interior of the motherland via the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, the prices of daily necessities such as grain, tea, and cloth on the Lhasa market remained very stable.

    拉萨举行传召大会
    拉萨的传召大会在二月二十六日正式开始。拉萨三大喇嘛寺的僧众都来到了市区，各地的喇嘛、农民和牧民也陆续赶来参加。清晨，市中心大昭寺内外挤满了集会祈祷的喇嘛和朝佛的人群。
    二十五日下午，成千上万的僧俗群众都听取了有线广播电台播送的毛主席在庆贺藏历新年宴会上的讲话，和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的讲话。由三大寺、西藏地方政府、中国人民解放军西藏军区代表组成的联合办事处，和西藏地区人民反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会，决定在传召大会期间举办有关反对使用原子武器和解放台湾、中苏友好等的有线广播和图片展览，散发达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼在第一届全国人民代表大会会议上的讲话，和世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”等宣传材料。主持传召大会的各寺庙的负责堪布们，已决定在传召大会上展开反对使用原子武器签名的宣传，并诵和平经。拉萨市人民医院准备好了大量痘苗，开始给参加传召大会的僧俗群众施种牛痘。
    传召大会开始前，拉萨市流动人口增加，但由于祖国内地货物不断从康藏、青藏公路运来，拉萨市场上的粮食、茶叶、布匹等生活必需品和日用品价格非常平稳。                     （新华社）
