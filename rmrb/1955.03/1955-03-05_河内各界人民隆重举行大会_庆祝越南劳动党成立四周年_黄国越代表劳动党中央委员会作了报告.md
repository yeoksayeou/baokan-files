Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 4th:

    A grand meeting was held by people from all walks of life in Hanoi on the evening of March 3rd to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

    Pham Van Dong, Hoang Quoc Viet, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Luong Bang, Le Van Luong, Ton Duc Thang, and other members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party attended the meeting.

    Also attending the meeting were representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the People's Army of Vietnam, combat heroes, and model workers in industry and agriculture.

    Diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries were invited to attend the meeting.

    The meeting was presided over by Ton Duc Thang, a member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

    Hoang Quoc Viet delivered a report at the meeting on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party. Hoang Quoc Viet said: Four years ago, the Indochinese Communist Party convened its Second National Congress and decided to establish the Vietnam Workers' Party. On March 3, 1951, the Labor Party met with the people of the whole country.

    Hoang Quoc Viet pointed out that the Vietnam Workers' Party inherited the heroic fighting tradition of the Indochinese Communist Party. In the past four years, thousands upon thousands of cadres and members of the Vietnam Workers' Party have always stood at the forefront of arduous and glorious struggles.

    Hoang Quoc Viet said that since the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, our country has experienced many major changes, from a colony to a democratic republic. Our people have organized a strong army from scratch, established a people's government and a national united front, and the revolutionary struggle has achieved many major victories. This is because the correct revolutionary line pointed out by the Party to lead the Vietnamese revolution to victory has guided the continuous and victorious development of our national liberation struggle; also because the Party has maintained close ties with the masses since the day it was founded, and has won the support of people from all walks of life, as well as the sympathy and support of fraternal countries and the people of the world, and the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the brilliant leader of the Vietnamese revolution, the Party, and the people. Historical facts have proven that the Vietnam Workers' Party is the leader and organizer of all victories of the Vietnamese people, the inheritor of the glorious tradition of the Vietnamese nation, and the representative of the highest interests of the Vietnamese nation.

    Hoang Quoc Viet said: This year, we are commemorating the Party's birthday in an atmosphere of excitement that the War of Resistance has been won and peace has just been restored. However, our victory is only the beginning, and the road of revolution is still long. The future of our people is infinitely bright and splendid, but there are still many difficulties. Today, American imperialism is stepping up its activities in Western Europe to create wars, and is openly undermining the Geneva Accords, and is stepping up its efforts to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc. Our people feel infinitely excited about the victories they have achieved and infinitely trust their own strength, but they are also very vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies. Our entire Party, the people of the whole country, and the people of Cambodia and Laos must resolutely hold back the challenging claws of American imperialism and its running dogs, resolutely defend the fruits of victory won through many years of sacrifice and struggle, safeguard peace in our country and the world, and at the same time prepare to defeat all adventurous actions of imperialist aggression and challenges.

    Hoang Quoc Viet continued, the main tasks of our entire Party and all the people at present are to fight for the respect and thorough implementation of the armistice agreement, and to strive for the realization of a general election as scheduled and the unification of the country; to demand the guarantee of the democratic and free rights of the people in the South, to restore normal relations between the North and the South, and to oppose forcing and deceiving the people of the North to move south; to step up the healing of war wounds, promote production, and restore the economy; to continue to promote the mobilization of the masses to realize rent reduction and land reform; to consolidate national defense and strengthen the people's armed forces.

    In order to complete the above tasks, our Labor Party members must constantly heighten their vigilance, unite sincerely with people outside the Party, and play an exemplary role in all work. The Party believes that patriotic people from all walks of life from south to north will unite more closely around the Party, the government, and President Ho Chi Minh, and advance to win new victories.

    Representatives of the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party, model workers in industry and agriculture, and representatives of intellectuals also spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the correct leadership of the Labor Party.

    After the meeting, a literary and artistic performance was held.

    河内各界人民隆重举行大会
    庆祝越南劳动党成立四周年
    黄国越代表劳动党中央委员会作了报告
    【新华社河内四日电】　三月三日晚上，河内各界人民隆重举行大会，纪念越南劳动党诞生四周年。
    越南劳动党中央委员会委员范文同、黄国越、武元甲、阮良朋、黎文良、孙德胜和中央委员会的其他委员和候补委员出席了大会。
    出席大会的还有：越南各民主党派、人民团体和人民军的代表，战斗英雄和工农业劳动模范等。
    苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的外交使节和使馆人员应邀出席了大会。
    大会由越南劳动党中央委员会委员孙德胜主持。
    黄国越代表越南劳动党中央委员会在会上作了报告。黄国越说：四年以前，印度支那共产党召开了第二次全国代表大会，决定成立越南劳动党。在一九五一年三月三日，劳动党就和全国人民见面了。
    黄国越指出，越南劳动党承继了印度支那共产党英勇斗争的传统。在过去的四年中，越南劳动党成千成万的干部、党员时时刻刻站在艰苦和光辉的斗争的最前列。
    黄国越说，从一九三零年印度支那共产党成立的那一天起，我国已经经历了许多重大的变化，从一个殖民地变成一个民主共和国，我国人民从赤手空拳的条件下组织了一支强大的军队、建立了人民政权和民族统一战线，革命斗争已经取得了许多重大的胜利。这是由于党所指出的为领导越南革命走向胜利的正确革命路线引导我们民族解放斗争不断地胜利发展着；也由于党从成立的那一天起不断地和群众保持密切的联系，得到了各阶层人民的拥护和支持，也得到了各兄弟国家和世界人民的同情和支持，以及有越南革命的导师、党和人民的英明领袖胡志明主席的领导。历史的事实已经证明了越南劳动党是越南人民一切胜利的领导者和组织者，是越南民族光荣传统的继承者和越南民族最高利益的代表者。
    黄国越说：今年我们在抗战获得胜利和和平刚得恢复的兴奋气氛中纪念党的生日。然而我们的胜利仅仅是开始，革命的道路还是很长。我国人民的前途是无限光辉灿烂的，但是困难仍然很多。今天，美帝国主义加紧在西欧进行制造战争的活动，并且明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协定，加紧进行将南越、老挝和柬埔寨拖入东南亚军事侵略集团的活动，我国人民对于已取得的胜利感到无限兴奋，无限信任自己的力量，但是对敌人的阴谋也非常警惕。我们全党和全国人民以及柬埔寨和老挝两国人民要坚决扼住美帝国主义及其走狗的挑战魔爪，坚决保卫多年来牺牲奋斗的胜利果实，维护我国和世界的和平，同时准备击败帝国主义的一切侵略和挑战的冒险行动。
    黄国越继续说，我们全党和全体人民当前的主要任务是，要为停战协定获得尊重和彻底实现而斗争，为实现如期进行普选、统一全国而斗争；要求保证南部人民的民主自由权利，恢复南北间的正常关系，反对强迫欺骗北部人民南迁；加紧医治战争创伤，推进生产，恢复经济；继续推进发动群众实现减租和土地改革；巩固国防，巩固人民的武装力量。
    为了完成以上任务，我们劳动党党员们要不断提高警惕，和党外人士真诚团结，在各项工作中起模范作用。党相信从南到北的各个爱国人民阶层，将更加紧密地团结在党、政府和胡志明主席的周围，为争取新的胜利而前进。
    在会上讲话的还有社会党和民主党的代表、工农业劳动模范、知识分子的代表等，他们一致表示衷心感谢劳动党的正确领导。
    会后举行了文艺演出。
