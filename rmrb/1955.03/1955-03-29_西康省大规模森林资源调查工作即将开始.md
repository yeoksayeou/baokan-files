Large-Scale Forest Resource Survey Work in Xikang Province to Begin Soon

    The forest resource survey work in Xikang Province this year is about to begin. A large number of forest surveyors are studying professional skills and ethnic policies. In April, three forest survey teams will depart one after another.

    This year, the forest resource survey task in Xikang Province has increased significantly compared to last year. In addition to surveying the area, reserves, tree species, and river transport conditions of the vast forest areas in southeastern Xikang Province, the task also includes completing the zoning of 400,000 hectares of afforestation land and the survey and design of 50,000 hectares of afforestation land in the Anning River basin. At the same time, a general survey of the forest resources in parts of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture will be conducted.

    Xikang Province is one of China's rich forest areas. In recent years, surveys of some forest areas distributed in the Qingyi River, Dadu River, Yalong River, and other river basins have proven that Xikang Province's forests not only have substantial reserves but are also of excellent quality. The trees are generally two to three hundred years old, with diameters generally over sixty centimeters, and some exceeding one meter. Most of them are spruce, fir, and hemlock, which are unique to the Southwest region and are excellent building materials with good compressive and tensile strength. In addition, there are many kinds of precious special-purpose timber. As most of the forest areas are distributed along rivers leading to the Yangtze River, a large amount of timber, after being harvested, can be transported to the Southwest, Northwest, and other places through inexpensive water transport to support basic construction projects.

    西康省大规模森林资源调查工作即将开始
    西康省今年的森林资源调查工作即将开始。大批森林调查人员正在学习业务和民族政策。四月份内，三个森林调查队即将陆续出发。
    今年西康省的森林资源调查任务比去年增加很多。除了要调查西康省东南部广大森林地带的面积、蓄积、材种和河道运输情况外，还要完成安宁河流域四十万公顷育林地面积的区划工作和五万公顷育林地面积的勘测设计工作。同时，要对藏族自治州部分森林资源进行概况踏查。
    西康省是我国丰富林区之一。几年来，经过对分布于青衣江、大渡河、雅砻江等流域的部分林区进行调查，已经证明西康省森林不仅蓄积量相当庞大，而且质量优良。一般树龄都有二三百年，直径一般都在六十公分以上，有的还超过一公尺。其中又多是西南区特有的云杉、冷杉、铁杉等柱力好、抗压力强的建筑用材。另外还有许多种珍贵的特殊用材。由于大部林区分布于通向长江的河流两岸，大量木材经开采以后，可以凭借廉价的水上运输运往西南、西北等地，支援基本建设工程。（张学愚）
