How We Organize Local Supply Sources
Northwest Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative Office

In the Northwest region, over 50 percent (and in some areas up to 70 percent) of the production and living materials needed by the vast number of farmers come from local sources. Of the total value of local products, 43.5 percent are agricultural production materials. These products include indispensable tools for plowing, sowing, fertilizing, harvesting, and transporting, as well as low-value, easily consumed items widely needed by the masses, such as pitchforks, brooms, and ox muzzles. 38.8 percent are necessities for the people’s livelihood, especially 17.6 percent are non-staple foods needed in cities and industrial and mining areas. 11 percent are minor medicinal herbs and other new varieties with export value or domestic sales needs, as well as miscellaneous hides, etc., and construction materials such as reed mats. Therefore, organizing local supply sources is a major task for supply and marketing cooperatives to serve agricultural production and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

In the past year, the work of the Northwest Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative in organizing local supply sources has exceeded the original plan. In terms of methods for organizing local supply sources, various regions have adopted diverse approaches, the most common of which are: for minor native and special products, mainly adopting the method of purchasing in free markets; for handicrafts and sideline agricultural products, mainly adopting methods such as processing, ordering, exclusive sales, or employing workers for production. In terms of material circulation, methods such as purchasing from outside the region, allocation from higher-level cooperatives, and internal material exchange within the enterprise system are generally adopted. The main shortcomings in our work of organizing local supply sources are that we have not truly started from organizing and supporting production, and there is a great deal of blindness, which is manifested in: first, not clarifying the production and sales situation, doing whatever comes up, doing whatever is convenient, such as focusing on organizing urban handicrafts, which have relatively concentrated production but small quantities, while paying little attention to the decentralized but huge quantities of sideline agricultural products; second, organizing when needed, and abandoning them when not needed, such as generally starting to organize before the summer harvest and stopping mostly after the summer harvest; third, there are few supply and marketing cooperatives that organize production, and many that reach out for goods. At exchange meetings, everyone reaches out to buy goods, but few sell, making the exchange meetings a mere formality; fourth, only placing orders with producers, without seriously helping producers solve production difficulties, often leading to the failure of contracts. In response to the above situation, and considering the scattered and decentralized characteristics of local supply sources, and in coordination with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, we believe that work methods must be changed. Therefore, starting in October last year, we began pilot projects in Lantian County, holding supply, production, and sales combination meetings with the participation of various production representatives, starting from supporting and developing production; strengthening planning, fully relying on producers, resolutely implementing the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and specifically studying and resolving issues such as output, specifications, prices, raw materials, tools, etc., and signing supply-sales combination contracts. On this basis, an internal material exchange meeting was held, ordering products worth 5,037,800,000 yuan (old currency) from producers and supplying producers with necessary raw materials, tools, and other materials worth 1,009,368,000 yuan (old currency). This kind of supply, production, and sales meeting not only resulted in large transaction volumes, but more importantly, it aligned the understanding and unified the steps of producers and supply and marketing cooperatives, thereby transforming the mutual suspicion, arguments over quantity, and disputes between buyers and sellers in the past into sincere discussions and close cooperation between each other, which greatly improved the work of organizing local supply sources. This method was promoted in more than 20 counties including Nanzheng in Shaanxi and more than 10 counties including Wushan in Gansu, and the results were very good. For example, through the supply, production, and sales combination meeting, Nanzheng County ordered goods worth 13.4 billion yuan (old currency) from producers, and Wushan County ordered goods worth 13.5 billion yuan (old currency) from producers.

From one year of organizing local supply sources, we have gained the following experiences:

1.  Due to the scattered and decentralized nature of local supply sources, and the fact that these producers are gradually moving towards collectivization, organizing local supply sources must be closely integrated with the agricultural and handicraft mutual aid and cooperation movement. The specific method is: according to the production season, under the leadership of the local party and government, hold regular supply, production, and sales combination meetings, and implement production and sales linkage on a democratic and voluntary basis to solve problems in production and material circulation and guide production. Experience has shown that this linkage is not only needed by the supply and marketing cooperatives, but also by agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams, so that they can engage in production without reservation. The main advantage of adopting county-wide supply, production, and sales combination meetings is that it can adapt to the characteristics of local supply sources, so that many difficult-to-solve problems such as raw material supply and price control can be resolved through the meeting by pooling the wisdom of the masses; and it can understand the overall situation of the county and unify production plans.

2.  Organizing local supply sources must establish a strong viewpoint of supporting production and oppose the simple idea of taking goods. Through organizing local supply sources, we must open up an "inexhaustible" source of goods for society to benefit national construction and meet the growing urban and rural demands. Therefore, in organizing the work, we must conscientiously and responsibly help producers solve production difficulties, especially the difficulties of raw materials and tools. While helping producers solve difficulties, we must also pay attention to educating producers to improve production techniques and specifications and quality, and guide production through contracts and price control.

3.  Organizing local supply sources must ascertain production and sales situations and have a clear understanding. In the previous period, because many supply and marketing cooperatives did not understand the production and sales situation of local supply sources, they believed that the few handicrafts distributed in market towns were the entire local supply source, and that they could be quickly organized without much effort by holding forums for handicraft workers, which resulted in two thoughts: one thought that local supply sources were "nothing more than that"; the other thought that local supply sources were "easy to organize" and "all organized." This seriously fostered blind complacency, and the work could not be carried out in depth. It was not until the pilot supply, production, and sales combination meetings were held, the situation was first clarified, and a large number of supply sources were discovered, that these erroneous ideas began to be reversed.

4.  On the basis of organizing production, a rational distribution of materials must be implemented. This is a very important task in the situation of supply falling short of demand. Through rational distribution of materials, conservative tendencies and the tendency to seek greater profits through simple external sales are overcome, and the blindness in internal exchanges in the past is reversed. In the entire distribution of materials, the principle of democratic centralism of higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives and lower-level cooperatives obeying the leadership of higher-level cooperatives is emphasized, and the method of county cooperatives being responsible for contracting with grassroots cooperatives and provincial cooperatives being responsible for contracting with county cooperatives is adopted to give play to the enthusiasm of lower-level cooperatives and strengthen the integrity of the supply and marketing cooperative system. After the production and sales linkage is normalized, this distribution can be gradually transformed into planned allocation.

In general, the work of organizing local supply sources in the past year has achieved great results. Although the organized quantity is still very small, it has created favorable conditions for further organizing supply sources in the future in terms of ideological understanding and working methods.

However, because the work has just begun, there are still several issues that need to be resolved in the future:

1.  The issue of utilizing rural private merchants. Local supply sources are distributed in the vast countryside, and the more remote the area, the more undiscovered new commodities there are. Therefore, according to the current strength of the supply and marketing cooperatives, it is not possible to discover the vast rural local supply sources and revitalize urban and rural material exchanges by relying solely on the supply and marketing cooperatives. In Lantian County, ordering goods from the masses in the pilot supply, production, and sales combination meetings only accounted for 36.8 percent of the total value of the preliminary survey, and in Nanzheng County, it was only 37.1 percent. This proves that under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, how to utilize, restrict, and transform rural private merchants is a very important and necessary task. The private merchants who operate local (rural) supply sources have a basic characteristic: most of them are shoulder-pole peddlers. Although they also make some commercial profits, they mainly obtain legitimate transportation income. Therefore, in terms of utilization and transformation, they should be regarded as laborers. The main method is for the supply and marketing cooperatives to establish agency purchase relationships with the shoulder-pole peddlers. They can be absorbed to participate in the supply, production, and sales combination meetings and assigned a certain purchase quota; as for retailers who operate local supply sources, after the supply and marketing cooperatives control the local supply sources, they can establish agency sales or distribution relationships with them.

2.  How to ensure the realization of the supply, production, and sales combination contract. The supply, production, and sales combination is only a relatively good way to obtain local supply sources, and the signing of the combination contract is only the beginning of the work. How to turn a piece of paper into usable materials depends on the specific organization and supervision and inspection of production by the supply and marketing cooperatives. This requires: first, strengthening the acquisition agencies of the supply and marketing cooperatives: each grassroots cooperative must set up acquisition stations, and the county federation of cooperatives should set up professional management departments to closely link up with the grassroots cooperatives and private acquisition merchants. Second, the local supply source acquisition agencies of the cooperatives at all levels should often select a certain number of cadres to go deep into the villages to understand the production situation, understand the difficulties and problems in production, and at the same time continuously investigate and study, discover new commodities, and expand the organization of supply sources. Third, due to the great seasonality of local supply source production and supply, it is necessary to make early reserves in the off-season, so it is necessary to simultaneously strengthen the storage and transportation capacity of county and grassroots cooperatives. The county cooperative should have warehouses at various distribution centers in the county. While organizing production, the grassroots cooperatives should also pay attention to organizing the transportation capacity of the masses. In order to closely coordinate production and transportation, representatives of the transportation industry should be invited to participate in the county-wide supply, production, and sales combination meeting to solve transportation difficulties at the same time.

    我们怎样组织地方货源
    西北区供销合作社办事处
    西北地区广大农民的生产和生活资料，百分之五十（个别地区达到百分之七十）以上货源来自地方。在地方货源产值中，有百分之四十三点五是农业生产资料。这些产品中，有农业生产上耕田、播种、施肥、收获、运输等不可缺少的工具，还有低值、易耗但为群众普遍大量需要的杈把、扫帚、牛笼嘴等。有百分之三十八点八是群众生活必需品，特别有百分之十七点六是城市和工矿区必需的副食品。有百分之十一是有出口价值或内销需要的小宗药材等新品种，还有杂皮等，另有基本建设需要的芦席等材料。因此，组织地方货源，是供销合作社为农业生产服务、加强城乡物资交流的一项重大工作。
    一年以来，西北区供销合作社组织地方货源的工作超过了原计划。在组织地方货源的方法上，各地采取了多种多样的办法，最普遍的是：对小宗土特产品，主要采取在自由市场收购方式；对手工业和农家副业产品，主要采取加工、订货、包销或雇工生产等方式。在物资流通上，一般地采取了区外采购、上级社调拨及本企业系统内部物资交流等方式。我们在组织地方货源工作上的主要缺点是没有真正从组织和扶助生产出发，并且盲目性很大，这表现在：一、没有摸清产销情况，碰到啥作啥，啥顺手干啥，如以主要力量组织生产比较集中、但数量很少的城镇手工业，而对生产分散、但数量庞大的农家副业，就很少注意组织；二、用着时组织，用不着时放开不管。如在夏收前普遍动手组织，夏收后大部停顿起来；三、组织生产的供销合作社少，伸手要货的供销合作社多。交流会上家家伸手买货，但卖货的少，使交流会流于形式；四、只向生产者订货，不认真帮助生产者解决生产上的困难，往往造成合同落空。针对上述情况，根据地方货源零星分散的特点，配合农村互助合作运动的发展，我们认为必须改变工作方法。因此，从去年十月起，我们就在蓝田县试办有各种生产代表参加的供、产、销结合会议，从扶植和发展生产出发；并加强计划性，充分依靠生产者，坚决贯彻自愿互利原则，具体研究解决产量、规格、价格、原料、工具等问题，签订供销结合合同。在这个基础上，又举行内部物资交流会向生产者订购产品总值旧币五十亿三千七百八十万元，并供应生产者必需的原料、工具等物资总值旧币十亿零九千三百六十八万元，这种供、产、销会议，不仅成交数量大，特别重要的是使生产者与供销合作社认识一致，步调统一，从而把已往买卖之间的互相猜疑，争多论少，变成彼此间的诚恳讨论和密切结合，这就使组织地方货源工作大大地提高了一步。这个方法在陕西南郑等二十余县、甘肃武山等十余县推广，效果都很好。如南郑县通过供、产、销结合会，向生产者订货总值旧币一百三十四亿元，武山县向生产者订货总值旧币一百三十五亿元。
    从一年组织地方货源工作中，我们取得了以下几点经验：
    一、由于地方货源的零星分散，同时这些生产者逐步走向合作化，因之组织地方货源，必须和农业、手工业互助合作运动密切结合起来。具体办法是：按生产季节，在当地党政领导下，定期召开供、产、销结合会议，在民主自愿的基础上，实行产销挂钩，以便解决生产和物资流通中的问题，指导生产。经验证明，这种挂钩，不只是供销合作社所需要，农业生产合作社或互助组也需要，以便放手生产。采取以县为范围的供、产、销结合会议的主要优点，是能适应地方货源的特点，使许多原料供应、价格掌握等难以解决的问题，都可通过会议，集中群众智慧加以解决；而且可以了解全县总的情况，统一计划生产。
    二、组织地方货源必须树立坚强的扶植生产的观点，反对单纯取货思想。要通过组织地方货源工作，为社会开辟“取之不尽，用之不竭”的货源，以利国家建设，适应日益增长的城乡要求。因此，在组织工作中，必须认真负责地扶助生产者解决生产上的困难，特别是要解决原料、工具等困难问题。在帮助生产者解决困难的同时，还要注意教育生产者改进生产技术和规格质量，并通过合同和掌握价格来指导生产。
    三、组织地方货源，必须摸清产销情况、做到心中有数。前一个时期，由于很多供销合作社没有摸清地方货源的产销情况，认为分布在集镇上的少数手工业就是全部地方货源，通过召开手工业者座谈会的形式，就可以不费力气地迅速组织起来，结果产生两种思想：一种认为地方货源“不过如此”；
  一种认为地方货源“容易组织”、“都组织了”。这样就严重地滋长着盲目自满情绪，工作不能深入。等到试办供、产、销结合会议，首先摸清情况，发现大量货源后，才开始扭转了这些错误思想。
    四、在组织生产的基础上，必须实行合理的物资分配。这在物资供不应求的情况下，是一项十分重要的工作，通过合理的分配物资，克服了保守和单纯外销牟取较大利润等偏向，扭转了已往内部交流中的盲目性。在整个物资分配中，并强调上级社为下级社服务，下级社服从上级社领导的民主集中原则，采取县社对基层社负责包干，省社对县社负责包干，以发挥下级社的积极性和加强供销合作社系统的整体性。这样的分配，在产销挂钩正常化以后，就可逐步转为计划调拨。
    总的说来，一年来的组织地方货源工作，获得了较大的成绩，虽然组织数量还很小，但在思想认识上、工作方法上，确为今后进一步组织货源创造了有利条件。
    但由于工作刚在开始，还有以下几个问题须待今后解决：
    一、利用农村私商的问题。地方货源分布在广大农村中，愈偏僻的地方没有发现的新商品愈多。因此，根据目前供销合作社力量，要发掘广大农村地方货源，活跃城乡物资交流，单凭供销合作社是不行的。蓝田县在试办供、产、销结合中，向群众订货只占初步摸底总值的百分之三十六点八，南郑县也不过占百分之三十七点一。这证明在供销合作社的领导下，如何利用、限制、改造农村私商是非常值得重视和必须做好的工作。经营地方（农村）货源的私商，有一个基本特点，就是肩挑小贩居多，他们虽也牟取了一点商业利润，但主要还是取得正当的运输收入。因此在利用改造上，应把他们当作劳动者看待。主要办法是供销合作社和收购肩贩建立代购关系。在召开供、产、销结合会议时，可吸收他们参加，分配一定的收购数字；至于经营地方货源的零售商，在供销合作社掌握地方货源后，可同他们建立代销或经销关系。
    二、如何保证供、产、销结合合同的实现问题。供、产、销结合只是取得地方货源的一个比较良好的办法，结合合同的签订也只是工作的开端，如何使一纸合同变成可以使用的物资，关键在于供销合作社对生产的具体组织和督导检查。这就必须：一、加强供销合作社的收购机构：各基层社必须设立收购站，县联社应当设置专业经理部，和基层社及私营收购商密切地挂起钩来。二、各级社地方货源收购机构应经常抽出一定数量的干部，深入乡村向群众了解生产情况，了解生产中的困难问题，同时不断调查研究，发现新商品，扩大货源的组织工作。三、由于地方货源生产和供应的季节性很大，需要淡季早作储备，因此必须同时加强县、基层社的储运力量。县社应在县内各集散地点设有仓库。基层社在组织生产的同时，还要注意组织群众运输力量。为了使生产与运输密切配合起来，在召开全县供、产、销结合会议时，应邀请运输业代表参加，以便同时解决运输困难。
