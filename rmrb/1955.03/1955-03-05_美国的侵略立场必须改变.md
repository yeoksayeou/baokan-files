The U.S. Aggressive Stance Must Change
Jiang Yuanchun

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Taiwan on the 3rd and held talks with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit, and issued a statement filled with war cries after the talks. In the statement, Dulles once again played his old trick that had long failed: attempting to use the threat of war to force the Chinese people to tolerate the U.S. occupation of Taiwan.

Dulles once again used the authority arbitrarily granted to Eisenhower by the U.S. Congress to attack China to intimidate the Chinese people. He said that if the Chinese people's "military actions, preparations and concentration in the Taiwan area" "in fact constitute the first stage of an attack on Taiwan," then the U.S.'s so-called "defense" of Taiwan "will not be static and limited to Taiwan itself." In other words, the U.S. is attempting to attack the Chinese mainland.

Dulles also openly announced the expansion of U.S. aggression to Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu) Islands. He said that because these two islands have a "real relationship" to the U.S. "ensuring" Taiwan and Penghu (the Pescadores), the U.S. "may consider protecting them...appropriate." But it is easy for anyone to see that the reason the U.S. wants to occupy Jinmen and Mazu Islands is not only to "ensure" the occupation of Taiwan, but also to facilitate their use as stepping stones to realize the U.S. dream of conquering the Chinese mainland. In order to realize this conspiracy, a large number of U.S. generals, including U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Carney, Pacific Fleet Commander Stump, and Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, are holding military conferences with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan to discuss the so-called "coastal islands issue" and strengthen military assistance to the Chiang bandit.

However, the intimidation of aggressive war cannot scare the Chinese people who have a glorious tradition of anti-aggression. Dulles should think about how many people in the past century have妄想 tried to invade China, and where are they now?

Dulles, regardless of his own limitations, relies on the so-called military strength of the U.S. to persist in occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and妄想 attempts to expand U.S. aggression to the whole of China. But he desperately wants people to believe that it is not the U.S. invading China, but China carrying out so-called "aggression."

Who is China "aggressing" against? Taiwan is China's territory. The Chinese people liberating Taiwan cannot be "aggressing" against the U.S., which is more than 10,000 kilometers away. Then, can there be such a thing as China "aggressing" against China?

In order to exaggerate China's so-called "aggressive conspiracy," Dulles also repeated those bankrupt slanders of China "aggressing" against Korea and Indochina. However, when Dulles himself openly promoted the shameless conspiracy of launching a three-pronged war against China from Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina at the Bangkok Conference, the world understood more clearly: why Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy Taiwan and expand interference in the Indochina War at the same time as he announced armed intervention in Korea in June 1950. It is obvious that the U.S.'s aggressive actions in Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina are all to expand aggression against China and prepare for a new war.

However, Dulles is trying to push the responsibility for war onto the Chinese people. In his statement, he continued to tout the possibility of a so-called "ceasefire" by the United Nations, while stating that the U.S. refuses to participate in "any negotiations" without the participation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This proves that the U.S. has no intention of easing the tension in the Taiwan area. This also thoroughly exposes the peace rhetoric spread by Dulles in order to cover up his own aggressive ugly face with a veil of "peace."

Dulles should be warned: it is a dream to think that the Chinese people will use their own territory to beg for "peace"! The U.S. occupation of Taiwan and preparations for war constitute a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. In order to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in order to defend peace, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. This is the firm and unshakeable position of the Chinese people. The U.S. aggressive stance must change, otherwise it will absolutely not be able to escape the responsibility for all the consequences caused by its aggressive actions.

    美国的侵略立场必须改变
    蒋元椿
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在三日抵达台湾和蒋贼介石举行会谈，并在会谈以后发表了一项充满战争叫嚣的声明。杜勒斯在声明中再次玩弄他那套早已失灵的把戏：妄想用战争威胁来迫使中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾。
    杜勒斯再次用美国国会授予艾森豪威尔的任意进攻中国的权力来恫吓中国人民。他说，如果中国人民“在台湾地区的军事行动、准备和集中”“在事实上构成对台湾进攻的第一阶段”，就不能认为美国对台湾的所谓“防御”“将是静止的并限于台湾本身”。换句话说，美国企图进攻中国大陆。
    杜勒斯还公然宣布要把美国的侵略扩大到金门岛和马祖岛。他说，由于这两个岛屿对于美国“确保”台湾和澎湖“有着真正的关系”，因此美国“可能认为保护它们……是适宜的”。但是任何人都不难看出，美国所以要侵占金门岛和马祖岛，不但是为了“确保”侵占台湾，而且是为了便于以它们作为踏脚石，实现美国征服中国大陆的迷梦。为了实现这个阴谋，大批美国将军，包括美国海军作战部长卡涅、太平洋舰队司令斯图普，第七舰队司令普赖德，正在台湾和蒋介石卖国集团举行军事会议，讨论所谓“沿海岛屿问题”和加强对蒋贼的军事援助问题。
    但是，侵略战争的恫吓威胁是吓不倒有着反侵略的光荣传统的中国人民的。杜勒斯应当想一想，在过去一个世纪中有过多少人妄想侵略中国，他们现在都哪里去了？
    杜勒斯不知天高地厚，凭着美国的所谓军事实力坚持侵占中国的领土台湾，并且妄想把美国的侵略扩大到全中国来。但是他却拚命要使人相信并不是美国在侵略中国，而是中国在进行所谓“侵略”。
    中国在“侵略”谁呢？台湾是中国的领土，中国人民解放台湾，不可能是“侵略”远在一万多公里以外的美国，那末，难道天下会有中国“侵略”中国的事情吗？
      杜勒斯为了渲染中国的所谓“侵略阴谋”，还重复了那些早已破产了的诬蔑中国“侵略”朝鲜和印度支那的滥调。但是，当杜勒斯自己在曼谷会议上公然宣传从朝鲜、台湾、印度支那对中国展开三面作战的无耻阴谋的时候，全世界就更清楚地懂得了：为什么杜鲁门在一九五○年六月宣布武装干涉朝鲜的同时，要命令第七舰队侵占台湾，并且扩大对印度支那战争的干涉。十分明显，美国在朝鲜、台湾、印度支那的侵略行动，都是为了扩大对中国的侵略，准备新战争。
    然而杜勒斯却企图把战争的责任推在中国人民身上。他在声明中继续吹嘘由联合国进行所谓“停火”的可能性，同时表示美国拒绝参加没有蒋介石卖国集团参加的“任何谈判”。这证明美国完全不想缓和台湾地区的紧张局势。这也就彻底揭穿了杜勒斯为了给自己的侵略丑脸遮上“和平”的面纱而散布的和平论调。
    应当正告杜勒斯：要想中国人民用自己的领土来乞求“和平”，这是在做梦！美国侵占台湾，准备战争，构成了对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。中国人民为了保障自己的主权和领土完整，为了保卫和平，必须解放台湾。这是中国人民坚定不移的立场。美国的侵略立场必须改变，否则它就绝对逃避不了它的侵略行为所引起的一切后果的责任。
