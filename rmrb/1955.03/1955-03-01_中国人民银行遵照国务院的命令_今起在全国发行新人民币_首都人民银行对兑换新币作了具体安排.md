Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: Starting March 1st, the People's Bank of China will begin issuing new Renminbi throughout the country, while simultaneously withdrawing the old Renminbi. The People's Bank of China has now transported the new Renminbi to its branches throughout the vast urban and rural areas of the country.

In addition to the existing 19,000+ units, local People's Banks have entrusted a portion of supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and state-owned enterprises to handle the exchange of the new currency in urban and rural areas.

In remote rural areas without banks or exchange agencies, the banks will send out mobile exchange teams. Most of the personnel handling the exchange work have undergone short-term training and are familiar with the exchange procedures.

In the past few days, local People's Banks, in accordance with the provisions of the State Council's order on issuing the new Renminbi and withdrawing the current Renminbi, have converted the old currency amounts of all deposits, savings, and loans into new currency at the statutory exchange rate of 1:10,000. They have also issued reconciliation statements to all public and private enterprises, state organs, organizations, or deposit account holders in cities who use checks, based on the new-to-old currency ratio. The work of changing accounts in local private enterprises is also proceeding intensively.

From March 1st, the new Renminbi will become the sole unit of calculation for all monetary receipts and payments, transaction pricing, contracts, agreements, documents, vouchers, accounting records, and international settlements in our society.

Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: Today, the People's Bank of the capital has transported a large quantity of new Renminbi to more than 500 exchange institutions in the urban and suburban areas. The staff in the treasury of the Dongdan District Office of the Municipal People's Bank opened the last wooden box this afternoon, took out the last bundle of new currency, and sent the new currency to the twenty-three exchange offices under the jurisdiction of the office. The staff of the Caishikou Office of the Municipal People's Bank have made specific plans for exchanging the new currency. They have arranged the exchange times for larger factories and government offices. Activists from the residents' committees in the Xuanwu District have held meetings and are actively preparing to assist the People's Bank in issuing the new currency.

The new currency prices for more than 30,000 kinds of commodities in the state-owned Municipal Department Store have been reviewed and approved. As soon as the twenty-five shopping malls stopped evening business, the salespersons put hundreds of thousands of new price tags, which had been reviewed three or four times, on the commodities one by one, replacing the old price tags. The advanced sock team in the First Department Store displayed more than 200 kinds of socks a few days ago and replenished new goods. In the bustling Dong'an Market, more than 500 seated merchants and stallholders also made preparations tonight. At six or seven o'clock in the evening, new currency prices appeared in some stores. Many theaters have already marked the new currency ticket prices for tomorrow's performances on today's posters.

Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: Five work groups organized by the Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee have gone to the offices of the People's Bank in various districts to supervise and inspect the issuance of the new Renminbi and the withdrawal of the old Renminbi. Three days ago, the Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the supervisory offices of various municipal departments to deploy the supervisory offices of various departments to mobilize the people's supervisory correspondents under their jurisdiction to actively cooperate in this work. The supervisory office of the Municipal Finance Bureau has formulated a work plan for conducting supervision and inspection.

    中国人民银行遵照国务院的命令
    今起在全国发行新人民币
    首都人民银行对兑换新币作了具体安排
    【新华社二十八日讯】从三月一日起，中国人民银行在全国各地开始发行新人民币，同时收回旧人民币。现在，中国人民银行已把新人民币运送到遍及全国广大城乡的分支机构。
    各地人民银行在广大城乡负责发行新币的机构，除原有的一万九千多个单位外，还委托一部分供销合作社、信用合作社和国营企业办理兑换。
    没有银行和代兑机构的偏僻农村，银行将派出流动兑换小组。办理兑换工作的人员多数已经过短期训练，熟悉了兑换手续。
    这几天内，各地人民银行遵照国务院关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令的规定，已按照新旧币一比一万的法定比价，把所有存款、储蓄、放款等账册的旧币数目折成了新币，并向各公私企业、国家机关、团体或城市内使用支票的存款户，按新旧币比率折算开出了对账单。各地私营企业的改账工作，也都在紧张进行。
    从三月一日起，新人民币就成为我国社会上一切货币收付、交易计价、契约、合同、单据、凭证、账簿记载及国际间的清算等的唯一计算单位。
    【新华社二十八日讯】今天，首都的人民银行已把大批新人民币先后运到市区和郊区五百多个兑换机构。市人民银行东单区办事处金库里的工作人员，在今天下午打开了最后一个木箱，取出了最后一捆新币，他们把新币送到了办事处所属的二十三个兑换所。市人民银行菜市口办事处的工作人员，对兑换新币已经作出具体计划。他们已安排了较大的工厂和机关的兑换时间。宣武区各街道居民委员会的积极分子都召开了会议，积极准备协助人民银行发行新币。
    国营市百货公司三万多种商品的新币标价已审订妥当。二十五个商场刚刚停止晚间营业，售货员们就把几十万张经过三、四次审核的新标价签逐一地放在商品上，把旧标价签换掉。第一门市部先进的袜子小组几天前就把二百多种袜子陈列好，又补充了新货。在热闹的东安市场，五百多家座商、摊商在今晚也作好了准备，晚六、七时，有些商店已出现了新币的标价。许多剧场今天海报上已标出了明日上演节目的新币票价。
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京市人民监察委员会组织的五个工作组，已分别到各区人民银行办事处进行发行新人民币和收回旧人民币的监督和检查工作。三天前，北京市人民监察委员会曾召集市属各部门的监察室负责干部开会，布置各部门监察室发动所属人民监察通讯员积极配合这一工作。市财政局监察室已订出了进行监督和检查的工作计划。
