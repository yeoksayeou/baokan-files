Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch: The British Labour Party Parliamentary Group held a secret meeting on the 16th, and the meeting decided by a slight majority to expel Bevan, the leader of the Labour Party's left wing, from the Parliamentary Group. Observers believe that this decision has triggered the biggest crisis in the Labour Party since World War II.

The proposal to expel Bevan was put forward by the leaders of the Labour Party's right wing, on the pretext that Bevan refused to support the Labour Party's right-wing leaders' proposal in the House of Commons to support the government's atomic arms race, saying that he despised the leadership of the Labour Party leaders and undermined the regulations of the Labour Party Parliamentary Group.

The Labour Party leaders are attempting to use Bevan's expulsion to intimidate all party members who dare to criticize their following of the Conservative government's war policies, so as to keep the party "free from division."

The Labour Party Parliamentary Group's meeting on the 16th began in an atmosphere of tension. Attlee read out the proposal to expel Bevan at the meeting and condemned Bevan for "lack of discipline," for example, he had taken action to protest the policy of the party's right-wing leaders in favor of the Manila Treaty, etc. Member of Parliament Frederick Lee proposed an amendment to Attlee's proposal, suggesting that Bevan be given a warning, but not expelled from the Parliamentary Group. At this time, the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party immediately stated that if this amendment was passed, it would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in them. As a result, this amendment was rejected by a narrow majority of fourteen votes.

Later, the meeting voted on the proposal of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders. The proposal passed by a vote of 141 to 112. The Labour Party has a total of 293 members in the House of Commons, so the number of members of parliament who voted in favor of expelling Bevan was less than half of the members of the Parliamentary Group.

The Associated Press said that some members of parliament believed that the situation of these two votes showed "a spiritual failure of Attlee and his right-wing followers." It shows that "the split in the Labour Party is very close to half and half."

After the Labour Party Parliamentary Group decided to expel Bevan, the miners of South Wales and the Labour Party members in Bevan's hometown immediately telegraphed Bevan, saying: "We all support your struggle."

### 英国工党议会党团开除比万  引起战后以来工党最大的危机

    英国工党议会党团开除比万
    引起战后以来工党最大的危机
    【新华社十七日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党议会党团在十六日举行秘密会议，会议以微弱多数决定把工党左翼领袖比万开除出议会党团。观察家认为，这个决定引起了第二次世界大战以来工党最大的一次危机。
    开除比万的建议是工党右翼领袖提出的，借口比万在下院拒绝支持工党右翼领袖的赞成政府进行原子军备竞赛的提案，说他蔑视了工党领袖的领导，破坏了工党议会党团的规章。
    工党的领袖们企图借开除比万来恐吓所有敢于批评他们追随保守党政府的战争政策的党员，而使党“免于分裂”。
    工党议会党团十六日的会议是在紧张的气氛中开始的。艾德礼在会上宣读了关于开除比万的提案，并且谴责比万“缺乏纪律性”，例如，他曾经以行动抗议党的右翼领袖赞成马尼拉战争条约的政策等。议员弗雷德里克·李对艾德礼的提案提出了一个修正案，建议给比万以警告处分，但是不把他开除出议会党团。这时工党的右翼领袖马上表示：如果通过这个修正案，就等于对他们表示不信任。结果，这个修正案以相差十四票的微弱多数被否决了。
    后来，会议就工党右翼领袖的提案进行表决。这个提案以一百四十一票对一百一十二票通过。工党在下院中一共有二百九十三个议员，所以，投票赞成开除比万的议员还不到议会党团议员的一半。
    合众社说，某些议员认为，这两次表决情况表明“艾德礼和他的右翼追随者的一种精神上的失败”。它显示“工党的分裂非常接近一半对一半”。
    工党议会党团决定它开除比万后，南威尔士的矿工和比万的家乡的工党党员马上打电报给比万说：“我们都支持你的斗争。”
