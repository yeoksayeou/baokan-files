Problems Can Only Be Seen Through Inspection
Zhang Youming
Recently, the work group of the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry went to Lingbao County to inspect the cotton planting preparations and found that the leading cadres there had a blindly optimistic attitude towards this year's cotton planting work. They said, "When planting wheat last year, farmers were already called upon to reserve the area for cotton fields," and "At the county's expanded cadre meeting, the county's spring production plan was arranged to various townships in conjunction with the conscription work."

Following the opinions of the county and district leaders, the work group selected the two key townships of Shuiquancheng and Changjiawan in the Fourth District for inspection. It is said that the work of these two townships is considered to be relatively good in the county. The work group did see some mass production activities in these two townships, but these activities were spontaneous.

Cotton fields in Shuiquancheng and Changjiawan townships account for more than 40% of the cultivated land area. Due to the high cotton yield and good price, the masses are accustomed to planting cotton. In addition, the grain supply is also timely. In theory, expanding cotton fields here this year should not be a big problem. According to the plan, Shuiquancheng Township's cotton planting task this year should be expanded by 11.3% compared to last year. However, the work group's investigation of two agricultural production cooperatives, twelve mutual aid teams, and ten individual farmers showed that the planned cotton planting area of these cooperatives, teams, and farmers this year only increased by 10.54% compared to last year, and it was very uneven. Although these cooperatives, teams, and farmers have enough land to expand cotton fields, they do not necessarily intend to plant cotton according to the state plan. Among them, two mutual aid teams and four farmers even plan to reduce the cotton planting area. The reason for these problems is that most farmers are afraid that there will be problems with the grain supply in the future, and a few are afraid that they will not be able to take care of the labor if they plant too much cotton.

Shuiquancheng and Changjiawan townships are the key cotton-producing townships in Lingbao County, and farmers are accustomed to keeping cotton seeds. However, according to the work group's investigation of two agricultural production cooperatives, seven mutual aid teams, and twenty-eight individual farmers, the average amount of cotton seeds kept per mu is only nine jin (according to the prescribed standard, it is generally necessary to keep fifteen jin per mu), and it is not balanced. Among them, three mutual aid teams and seven farmers have a surplus of cotton seeds according to the prescribed standard, while two cooperatives, three teams, and eleven farmers do not have enough cotton seeds for sowing. In addition, the purity of the cotton seeds does not meet the standard.

The shortage of fertilizer in these two townships is even more serious. The existing fertilizer is about one-quarter less than the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the same period in previous years. These two townships have fertilizer sources, but farmers are unwilling to look for them. For example, there are no pigsties in these two townships for raising pigs, but farmers are unwilling to enclose pigs to accumulate fertilizer. The idea of relying on the government to supply fertilizer is very serious. This makes it difficult to guarantee the realization of the county's plan to increase cotton production by nine jin per mu compared to last year.

The farmers in these two townships believe that it is still early and that the land has moisture, so there is no need to rush. Therefore, plowing and sending manure are later than in previous years. There are still many cotton fields that have not been plowed; those that have been plowed have not been harrowed to preserve moisture.

From the situation in these two key townships, it can be seen that the county's leading cadres' statement that there is no problem in completing the cotton planting plan is unfounded. From this, we should draw a lesson: if we do not go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and discover problems, but only sit in the office to arrange production and lead production, we cannot solve problems, nor can we lead production well.

    通过检查才能看出问题
    张幼鸣
    最近，河南省农林厅的工作组到灵宝县检查植棉准备工作，发现那里的领导干部对今年的植棉工作有着盲目乐观情绪，他们说，“去年种麦的时候已经号召农民留下了棉田的面积”，“在县扩大干部会上，已经结合征集兵员工作把县的春季生产计划向各乡作了布置”。
    工作组依照县、区领导上的意见，选择了四区水泉城和常家湾两个重点乡进行检查。据说这两个乡的工作在这个县说来是做得比较好的。工作组在这两个乡的确也看到了一些群众的生产活动，可是这些活动是自流的。
    水泉城和常家湾两个乡棉田都占耕地面积百分之四十以上。由于棉花产量高，价格好，群众对种棉有习惯，加上粮食供应也还及时，按理今年这里扩大棉田的问题不大。按照计划，水泉城乡今年的植棉任务要比去年扩大百分之十一点三。但工作组在两个农业生产合作社、十二个互助组和十个单干农户调查的结果，这些社、组和农户今年植棉计划面积比去年只扩大百分之十点五四，并且很不平衡。这些社、组和农户虽然有足够的土地来扩大棉田，但是他们并不一定都打算按照国家计划来种棉花，其中有两个互助组和四家农户甚至还计划要减少棉田播种面积。发生这些问题的原因，大多数农民是害怕今后粮食供应有问题，少数是害怕种棉多了劳力顾不过来。
    水泉城和常家湾两个乡是灵宝县的产棉重点乡，农民对留棉种是有习惯的。但是根据工作组在两个农业生产合作社、七个互助组和二十八个单干农户调查的结果看，一般留的棉种平均每亩只合九斤（按规定标准一般每亩需留种十五斤），而且不平衡，其中有三个互助组和七个农户留的棉种按规定标准有剩余，有两个社、三个组和十一家农户留的棉种不够播种。另外棉种的纯度还不符合标准。
    这两个乡的缺肥的情况更严重。现有的肥料，比往年同期积肥量约少四分之一。这两个乡有肥源，但农民却不愿意去寻找。例如这两个乡养猪都没有猪圈，农民却不愿意把猪圈起来积肥。倚赖政府供给肥料的思想很严重。这对实现县里提出的每亩棉花比去年增产九斤的计划，也就难以保证。
    这两个乡的农民认为时间还早，地里有墒，用不着忙，因此犁地、送粪都比往年动手晚。现在还有很多棉田没有翻耕；翻耕了的也没有耙地保墒。
    从这两个重点乡的情况可以看出，这个县的领导干部认为完成种棉计划没有问题的说法，是没有根据的。从这里我们应该得出教训，不深入下层去摸清情况，发现问题，只是坐在机关里布置生产，领导生产，是不能解决问题的，也是领导不好生产的。
