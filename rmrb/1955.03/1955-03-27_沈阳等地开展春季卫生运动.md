    Spring Hygiene Campaign Launched in Shenyang and Other Places
    Recently, industrial cities such as Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Lushun-Dalian have successively held patriotic hygiene movement meetings, mobilizing the masses to extensively and deeply carry out the spring patriotic hygiene movement. The Shenyang Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committee has decided to continue to implement the principle of "combining hygiene work with mass movements," strengthen hygiene supervision and inspection, and at the same time, hold various forms of short-term training courses to train propaganda cadres. Many factories, schools, cooperatives, and other units have expressed their willingness to earnestly ensure that the patriotic hygiene movement becomes regular. The Anshan Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committee requires all factories and mines to pay attention to safety, improve the working environment, and reduce occupational and common diseases in the implementation of "civilized production." Fushun's spring patriotic hygiene movement plan this year focuses on factories, mines, and construction sites, requiring the city to basically eradicate disease-carrying insects, improve the underground working environment in various coal mines, strengthen safety facilities, and remove silt, etc. Lushun-Dalian has decided to do a good job in major cleaning and maggot removal, thoroughly removing garbage and sewage, and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, etc. (Our correspondent in Shenyang)
