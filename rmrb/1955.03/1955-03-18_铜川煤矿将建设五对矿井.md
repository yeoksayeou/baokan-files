The Northwest Tongchuan Coal Mine will newly build, renovate, and continue construction on five pairs of mine shafts this year, excavating over 9,000 meters of coal and rock roadways, and installing more than 150 pieces of various machinery. Two railway branch lines will also be laid and over 30 kilometers of high-voltage power lines erected within the mining area.

Preparations for various capital construction projects in the mining area are underway. Large quantities of steel, cement, machinery, and steel rails and sleepers for railway construction have been continuously transported in. The preliminary survey and route selection for the railway branch line from Zhiyigucun to Wangshi'ao in the mining area have been completed, and surveyors are conducting route measurement and alignment. Workers at the repair shop have also begun to overhaul equipment such as winches and boilers for construction. Hundreds of apprentices with a certain level of education recruited by the Tongchuan Coal Mine are undergoing various technical training programs. Flat roadway tunneling teams and power line installation teams have also been established successively. Recently, the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute submitted partial detailed construction drawings for some projects scheduled to commence in the second quarter and all the technical design drawings for the Sanlidong vertical shaft, creating conditions for smooth construction.

    铜川煤矿将建设五对矿井
    西北铜川煤矿今年将新建、改建和续建五对矿井，开辟煤巷和石巷九千多公尺，安装各种机械一百五十多台。矿区内并将铺筑两条铁路支线和架设三十多公里长的高压输电线路。
    矿区今年各项基本建设的准备工作正在紧张进行。大批钢材、水泥、机器和修筑铁路用的钢轨、枕木等都已陆续运到；矿区内自宜古村通往王石凹的一条铁路支线的初测、选线工作已告结束，测量人员正在进行路线的测量和定线工作。修配厂的职工也已开始检修施工用的绞车、锅炉等设备。铜川煤矿招收的几百个具有一定文化水平的学徒，正在进行各种技术训练。平巷掘进队和输电线路安装队也已先后成立。最近西安煤矿设计院提出了铜川煤矿第二季度计划开工的一些工程的部分施工详图和三里洞坚井的全部技术设计图纸，为顺利施工创造了条件。（新华社）
