    Topsoil is a Good Fertilizer
    Ji Zhiben, He Jinsheng

    Topsoil, also called house yard soil or house foundation soil, and in some places called "thousand-foot print ash," is a good fertilizer that is fast-acting, potent, and available everywhere. The folk sayings "Exchange home soil for wild soil, one mu equals two mu," "Home soil, tiger in the field," and "A thousand-year threshing ground can't compare to a house yard of the current year" show that some people have a certain understanding of the effectiveness of topsoil.

    In 1953, when we analyzed the effectiveness of old wall soil, we found that the closer it was to the ground, the greater the fertilizer effect. We also heard about Chu Meisheng of Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County, using topsoil to increase production. These facts inspired us to conduct research on topsoil. According to preliminary analysis, it was proved that topsoil does have fertilizer value. To further confirm the effectiveness of topsoil, we re-analyzed the topsoil dug by the masses and also found more than ten plots of land where topsoil and other fertilizers were applied to observe and study, so as to verify the analysis results from the growth of crops.

    We collected topsoil from a total of thirteen households. According to the analysis results, each hundred dan (one dan equals one hundred jin) of topsoil contains an average of 13.9 jin of available nitrogen, equivalent to 27.8 dan of human manure, or 69.5 jin of ammonium sulfate, which is 60.4 times higher than general soil; contains 25.2 jin of available potassium, equivalent to 630 jin of plant ash, which is 24.5 times higher than general soil; and contains 1.7 jin of available phosphorus, which is 7.4 times higher than general soil.

    On a field of barley belonging to Zhang Chuandao, a labor model from Songzi County, half of the field was fertilized with topsoil as a base fertilizer, amounting to about 30 dan per mu, while the other half was fertilized with old wall soil, using more than the topsoil. The part of the field fertilized with topsoil yielded 91 jin more barley per mu, an increase of 47 percent.

    Topsoil is a fertilizer containing all three essential elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These fertilizers can all dissolve in water and quickly exert their fertilizer effect, so they are suitable for use as topdressing. If crushed before application, the fertilizer effect will be even faster. When used as a base fertilizer, it is best to mix it with pig and cattle manure, compost, pond mud, and other fertilizers, so that the fertilizer effect is both fast and long-lasting. Whether used as a base fertilizer or topdressing, the amount should not be too much. Generally, 15 to 30 dan per mu is appropriate. If used in paddy fields, it is better to reduce the amount. Do not drain the water immediately after application to avoid loss.

    The depth of digging topsoil should be appropriate. For topsoil with more soil content, it is advisable to dig a little more than one cun deep, and for topsoil with more sand content, it can be dug to a little more than two cun deep. For topsoil that has been around for a long time, the digging depth can be appropriately increased. Topsoil from pig and cattle pens and toilets is relatively more fertile, and can be dug a little deeper. Some people in some areas have superstitious ideas and are unwilling to move the soil in their own homes, so attention should be paid to helping them eliminate such concerns.

    地皮土是一种好肥料
    季之本　何金生
    地皮土，也叫屋场土或屋基土，有的地方叫千脚板灰，是一种肥效快、劲头大、到处都有的好肥料。从“家土换野土，一亩顶两亩”，“家里土，地里虎”和“千年稻场，赶不上当年屋场”等农谚中，可见有些群众对地皮土的肥效是有一定认识的。
    一九五三年我们分析陈墙土的肥效时，发觉愈接近地面肥效愈大，又听到孝感县朋兴乡楚梅生施用地皮土增产的情况，这些事实启发了我们进行地皮土的研究；根据初步分析结果，证明地皮土确有肥料价值。为了进一步证实地皮土的肥效，我们把群众所挖的地皮土重新分析，还找到十多块施用地皮土和施用其他肥料的田地来观察研究，以便从庄稼的生长情况来印证分析结果。
    我们共取了十三户的地皮土，根据分析结果，每百担（每担一百斤）地皮土中，平均含有效氮十三点九斤，相当人粪尿二十七点八担，或硫酸铵六十九斤半，比一般土壤高六十点四倍；含有效钾二十五点二斤，相当草木灰六百三十斤，比一般土壤高二十四倍半；含有效磷一点七斤，比一般土壤高七点四倍。
    松滋县劳动模范张传道的一块大麦田，一半施地皮土作基肥，约合每亩三十担，另一半施的是陈墙土，用量比地皮土还多，施地皮土的每亩多收大麦九十一斤，增产百分之四十七。
    地皮土是一种氮磷钾三要素齐全的肥料。这些肥分都能溶解水中，很快地发挥肥效，因此适宜用作追肥，如果压碎后施用，肥效更快。用作基肥时，最好和猪牛栏粪、堆肥、塘泥等肥料混合施用，肥效既来得快，又可持久。无论作基肥或追肥用量都不要过多，每亩一般宜在十五担到三十担之间；如果用在水田，更宜减少，施后不要立即排水，以免流失。
    挖地皮土的深浅要合适。含土多的地皮土以挖一寸多深为宜，含砂多的可挖到两寸多深；年代久的地皮土，挖的深度可以适当增加；猪牛舍、厕所的地皮土比较肥些，可以挖得更深一点。有些地区群众有迷信思想，不愿意在自己家里动土，应注意帮助群众解除这种思想顾虑。
