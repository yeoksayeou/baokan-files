The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Issues Notice to Subordinates on Doing a Good Job in Conserving Grain
[This newspaper] The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued a notice on conserving grain within the supply and marketing cooperative system. The notice first pointed out the importance of the supply and marketing cooperative system in carrying out grain conservation work. The notice stated that because the supply and marketing cooperatives directly manage a large portion of the country's grain, they bear an important responsibility in all aspects, from purchasing, storage, and processing to sales. Therefore, cherishing grain should become a sacred duty of all cooperative staff.

The notice then required supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to do the following work:
	(1) All supply and marketing cooperatives that handle grain should conduct a comprehensive inspection of grain storage work. Grain warehouses should be thoroughly inspected, and warehouse management systems should be improved. In the process of transportation, packaging should be tight, and loading and unloading should be careful to prevent rain damage or loss. (2) In the process of grain sales, we must fight against all phenomena of discarding grain. The planned sales of grain should strive to prevent over-selling and supplying when it should not be supplied, on the premise of effectively guaranteeing the supply of grain to grain-deficient households. (3) In the work of purchasing grain, we must prevent grain from being scattered or spoiled due to mold in the process of weighing, storage, and transportation. (4) Rice and flour processing enterprises of supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should improve the rice and flour yield and reduce losses during processing, while meeting the national standards for grain processing accuracy and purity.

The notice finally requested that supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, in carrying out grain conservation work, should be personally led by responsible comrades to formulate methods and systems for conserving grain and preventing grain waste. In their work, they should pay attention to commending personnel with achievements in grain conservation, promote advanced experiences in grain conservation, and resolutely struggle against ideas that do not value grain conservation and against the phenomenon of grain waste.

    供销合作总社通知所属做好节约粮食工作
      【本报讯】中华全国供销合作总社发出关于在供销合作社系统节约粮食的通知。通知首先指出供销合作社系统开展节约粮食工作的重要意义。通知说，因为供销合作社直接掌管着国家的很大一部分粮食，无论在收购、保管、加工以至销售各个环节上，都担负着重要的责任。因此，爱护粮食应当成为合作社全体工作人员的神圣职责。
   通知接着要求各级供销合作社做好下列工作：
   （一）凡是经营粮食的供销合作社要普遍检查一下粮食的保管工作。对粮食仓库应普遍进行检查；并健全仓库保管制度。在调运过程中，包装要严密，上下车要仔细，不使雨淋、失落。（二）在粮食的销售过程中，要同一切抛撒粮食的现象作斗争。计划销售的粮食，要在切实保证供应缺粮户的前提下，力求防止超销和不应供应而供应的现象。（三）在收购粮食工作中，在过秤、保管、运输过程中要防止粮食抛撒霉烂等损失。（四）各地供销合作社的米面加工企业，在加工米面时，要在符合国家规定的粮食加工精度和纯度要求下，提高出米和出粉率，降低加工过程中的损耗。
    通知最后要求各地供销合作社在开展节约粮食的工作中，要由负责同志亲自领导，订出节约粮食和防止浪费粮食的办法、制度，并在工作中注意表扬节约粮食有成绩的人员，推广节约粮食的先进经验，向不重视节约粮食的思想和浪费粮食现象进行坚决的斗争。
