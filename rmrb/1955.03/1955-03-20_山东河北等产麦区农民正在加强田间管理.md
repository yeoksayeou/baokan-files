Farmers in major winter wheat producing areas such as Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Anhui in our country, are strengthening wheat field management to strive for a bumper harvest as wheat seedlings have generally turned green.

　　In Shandong Province, after the land thawed, farmers began trampling, pressing, hoeing, harrowing, topdressing, and watering in the wheat fields. In the Huimin and Changwei regions, wheat fields have been generally trampled once. Some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have begun hoeing wheat. According to statistics from more than 120 agricultural production cooperatives in Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Rizhao, Jimo, and Jidong counties, more than 4,400 mu of wheat have been watered and more than 600 mu have been topdressed. Farmers in Laiyang and Tai'an regions are hoeing wheat and applying topdressing.

　　In Hebei Province, according to incomplete statistics from Tongxian, Cangxian, and Tianjin regions, more than 3.5 million mu of wheat fields had been harrowed and pressed by the end of February. In Wen'an, Yongqing, and Anci counties in the Tianjin region, in addition to a general pressing, more than 120,000 mu have been topdressed. In Dingxing and other counties in the Baoding region, which were less affected by flooding in 1954, most of the wheat fields have been harrowed, and many have been topdressed. Farmers in Neiqiu, Shahe and other counties in the Xingtai region are also harrowing wheat and applying topdressing.

　　Farmers in the Wei River basin and the Yellow River irrigation area in northern Henan Province are repairing and increasing canal structures and small channels to expand the area of spring irrigation for wheat fields. Farmers in Luoyang, Luoning, Yanshi and other places have applied half of their existing fertilizer to the wheat fields. Farmers in the Huai River basin in the south have generally dug drainage ditches in waterlogged wheat fields to allow wheat seedlings to grow normally.

　　In southern Shanxi, wheat seedlings have begun to develop and turn green, and are generally growing vigorously. Farmers attach great importance to the processing and management of wheat fields. In Jiexian County, more than 460,000 mu of wheat had been harrowed once in February. The harrowing and processing of wheat fields in Linyi, Anyi, Wenxi, Yongji, Xiangfen, Hongzhao and other counties also started earlier than in previous years. Topdressing work for wheat fields is being widely carried out.

　　In Anhui Province, there was more rain and snow in winter, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges was very serious in some areas due to flooding and freezing. After the beginning of spring, farmers in various places began to check seedlings, replant seedlings, transplant seedlings, apply topdressing, and weed. According to incomplete statistics from the Liuan and Wuhu regions in early March, winter crops have been weeded on more than 2 million mu and topdressed on nearly 2 million mu.

    山东河北等产麦区农民正在加强田间管理
    我国冬小麦主要产区山东、河北、河南、山西、安徽等地，麦苗已普遍返青，农民正在加强麦田管理，争取丰收。
    山东省在土地解冻后，农民便在麦田间开始踩、压、锄、耙、追肥、浇水等工作。惠民昌潍两专区的麦田已普遍踏压一遍，有些农业生产合作社和互助组已开始锄麦。胶县、高密、日照、即墨、即东等县据一百二十多个农业生产合作社的统计，已浇小麦四千四百多亩，追肥六百多亩。莱阳、泰安等专区农民都在锄麦和施追肥。
    河北省据通县、沧县、天津三个专区的不完全统计，到二月底已耙、压麦田三百五十多万亩。天津专区的文安、永清、安次三县的五十多万亩麦田，除普压一遍外，已有十二万多亩施了追肥。保定专区一九五四年受涝较轻的定兴等县，大部麦田已耙完，许多都上了追肥。邢台专区的内邱、沙河等县农民也在耙麦追肥。
    河南省北部卫河流域、引黄灌溉区的农民，正在修增斗、毛渠工程，扩大麦田春浇面积。洛阳、洛宁、偃师等地农民已把现存肥料的一半追施到麦田里。南部淮河流域的农民普遍在积水的麦田里挖了排水沟，使麦苗得以正常生长。
    山西南部麦苗已开始发育返青，普遍生长茁壮。农民对麦田的加工管理都很重视。解虞县四十六万多亩小麦在二月间就耙?了一遍，临猗、安邑、闻喜、永济、襄汾、洪赵等县麦田的耙?加工，也都比往年动手较早。麦田追肥工作，正在广大地区普遍展开。
    安徽省各地冬季雨雪较多，部分地区由于受涝、受冻，缺苗断垄的现象很严重。入春后，各地农民就开始查苗、补苗、移栽、追肥、锄草。到三月初的不完全统计，六安、芜湖两专区冬季作物已锄草二百多万亩，追肥近二百万亩。
