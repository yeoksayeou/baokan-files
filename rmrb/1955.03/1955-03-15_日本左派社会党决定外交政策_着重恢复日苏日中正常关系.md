Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: According to a Kyodo News report, the Japanese Left-Wing Socialist Party decided on its foreign policy program at a Central Executive Committee meeting held on the 11th. This program focuses on restoring normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China, and indicates that it will vigorously supervise the Democratic Party to ensure that it faithfully fulfills its election promises regarding the restoration of relations with the Soviet Union. The program states that the Left-Wing Socialist Party will resolutely counter any attempts by the United States to exert pressure on Japan in establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union and China.

The program advocates finding ways to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," and the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," to cancel the negotiations for purchasing surplus U.S. agricultural products, and to strive to reduce Japan's burden of disguised occupation costs, etc.

The program also states: The Left-Wing Socialist Party will send representatives to the United States to "explain Japan's true intentions to U.S. officials and seek their opinions."

    日本左派社会党决定外交政策
    着重恢复日苏日中正常关系
    【新华社十四日讯】据共同社报道，日本左派社会党在十一日举行的中央执行委员会会议上决定了它的外交政策纲领。这个纲领着重于恢复日本同苏联、中国的正常关系，并且表示将对民主党进行有力的监督，使它忠实地履行关于和苏联恢复关系的选举诺言。纲领中说，左派社会党将坚决对付美国在日本同苏、中两国建立正常关系方面施加压力的任何企图。
    这个纲领主张设法废除美日“安全条约”、美日“行政协定”和美日“共同防御援助协定”，取消购买美国剩余农产品的谈判，争取减少日本所负担的变相占领费等。
    纲领同时又说：左派社会党将派代表到美国去“向美国官员们说明日本的真正意图，并征求他们的意见”。
