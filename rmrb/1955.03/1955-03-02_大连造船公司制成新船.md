    Dalian Shipbuilding Company Completes New Ships
    The two new ships built by the state-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company—a 1,200-horsepower ocean-going tugboat and a coastal passenger boat—have been proven to be of good quality through sea trials and were officially handed over to the customer in late February. These are the first batch of new ships produced by the shipyard after its transformation from a Sino-Soviet joint venture to a state-owned enterprise.
    The state-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company has inherited all the management and technical experience from the Sino-Soviet joint venture period and continues to consult with Soviet experts who are still working at the company, ensuring steady progress in production. In the past, ship delivery tests were directly led by Soviet experts, but now they are completely controlled by our own cadres and technicians, with Soviet experts only providing guidance when necessary. This work has been carried out very well. The delivery time for these two new ships was shorter than in the past. The surveyors and the customer were very satisfied with the quality of the two new ships. After the coastal passenger boat's sea trial, the customer said, "This ship is not only satisfactory in terms of engine operation, but also in other aspects." Liu Xianhuan, the deputy section chief of shipbuilding in the production department, who is a worker by origin, said, "This is the result of the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts over the past few years."

    大连造船公司制成新船
    国营大连造船公司新造的两只船——一千二百马力远洋拖船和近海小客艇，经航海试验证明质量良好，并在二月下旬正式移交订货主。这是造船公司由中苏合营改成国营后出产的第一批新船。
    国营大连造船公司继承了中苏合营期间的一切管理上和技术上的经验，并不断地请教目前仍留在公司工作的苏联专家，使生产稳步前进。过去交船试验工作都由苏联专家直接领导进行，现在完全由我国干部和技工掌握，苏联专家只是在必要时给以指导。这一工作进行得很好。这次两只新船的交船时间比过去都缩短了。验船师和订货主对这两只新船的质量都很满意。在近海小客艇试航后，订货主说：“这条船不但机器运转使人满意，就是在其他方面也使人满意。”工人出身的生产科造船副科长刘宪宦说：“这是几年来苏联专家热心帮助的结果。”
