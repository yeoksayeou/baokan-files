    【新华社六日讯】赫尔辛基消息：从美、英通讯社的报道中可以看出，美国政府正在对芬兰施压力，企图使芬兰放弃它同中华人民共和国的贸易联系。
    合众社从华盛顿发出来的消息说：美国政府在四日对芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”载运燃料到中国去这件事表示“十分不安”，并且已经责成美国驻芬兰大使麦克弗尔向芬兰政府表示，美国政府对这件事感到“遗憾”。“赫尔辛基新闻”说：麦克弗尔在早些时候已经就这个问题非正式地向芬兰当局交涉过。
    同时，路透社从伦敦发出来的消息说，英国外交部发言人五日宣布，英国决定不让“阿鲁巴号”油船在新加坡或者香港增添燃料。这个发言人还说，美国和英国曾就“阿鲁巴号”油船问题进行过外交接触，并且取得一般协议。
