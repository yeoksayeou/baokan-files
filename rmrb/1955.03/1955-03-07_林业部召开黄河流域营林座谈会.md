    The Ministry of Forestry recently held a symposium on afforestation in the Yellow River Basin in order to prepare for the Yellow River harnessing project in all aspects. According to the requirements of harnessing the Yellow River, the meeting focused on carrying out afforestation in the areas with severe soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The meeting proposed that 173,280 hectares of forest should be planted and 472,000 hectares of hillsides should be closed for afforestation in the Loess Plateau area in the next three years. The meeting believes that carrying out comprehensive soil and water conservation work in forestry, water conservancy, agriculture, and animal husbandry is very important for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River and developing the economy of the Loess region. Because there are very few forests in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu and other provinces, the loose loess encounters the heavy rains common in the Northwest, resulting in severe soil erosion. According to surveys, an average of 3,700 tons of sediment is lost per square kilometer every year in the 370,000 square kilometer area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The loss of these sediments is the root cause of frequent droughts in the middle reaches and floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Since liberation, the people of Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other six provinces (autonomous regions) in the Yellow River Basin have made many efforts in soil and water conservation, afforesting 150,000 hectares and closing hillsides for afforestation of more than 1 million hectares. In some areas of Qinghai Province where drinking water was scarce, there is now water not only for people to drink, but also for the land, thanks to closing hillsides for afforestation and planting trees. Farmers in Tianshui and other places in Gansu Province have planted trees such as black locust on slopes, and now there are no more incidents of mountain torrents damaging sloping farmland. The shortage of feed, fertilizer, and fuel in some areas in the past has also been initially improved, and agricultural and animal husbandry production has developed. In order to carry out soil and water conservation work on a planned and large scale in the Loess region, with a view to changing the historical appearance of the Yellow River and improving the people's production and living standards, the meeting believes that it is necessary to focus on afforestation and closing hillsides for afforestation in areas with serious soil erosion. To this end, Shaanxi Province must further build sand-control forests in northern Shaanxi, create water source forests in the upper reaches of the Luo River and other rivers, and immediately prepare for the construction of these forests. Gansu Province must immediately prepare for the construction of water source forests in the upper reaches of the Jing River, Wei River, and Zuli River. Shanxi Province must immediately prepare for the construction of water source forests in the upper reaches of the Fen River and the rivers in western Shanxi. Henan Province must immediately prepare for the construction of water source forests for the Yi River and Luo River and afforestation on the north bank of the Yellow River. Qinghai Province must immediately prepare for the construction of water source forests for the Huangshui River. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region must also prepare for the construction of shelterbelts in the west and water source forests in the upper reaches of the Wula Mountain and the Dahei River. The above-mentioned key afforestation areas should, in accordance with the requirements of development and harnessing the Yellow River and in conjunction with the mountain production plan, first complete a general survey in order to rationally divide agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production areas and arrange soil and water conservation work. The meeting requested that in carrying out afforestation and closing hillsides for afforestation, it is necessary to rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations and promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Whether it is carrying out soil and water conservation or afforestation and closing hillsides for afforestation, collective action and joint management are required. In addition, the meeting also requested that all localities establish forestry professional institutions, protect existing forests, prepare seedlings and seeds, and strengthen experimental research work to meet the needs of large-scale afforestation and closing hillsides for afforestation in the Yellow River Basin.

    林业部召开黄河流域营林座谈会
    为了给黄河根治工程做好各方面的准备工作，最近中华人民共和国林业部召开了黄河流域营林座谈会。会议根据治理黄河的要求，着重研究了在黄河中游水土流失严重的地区开展植树造林工作。会议提出：黄土高原区今后三年内要造林十七万三千二百八十公顷，封山育林四十七万二千公顷。会议认为，开展林业、水利、农业、畜牧业综合性的水土保持工作，对根治黄河和发展黄土区域的经济都十分重要。由于陕西、山西、甘肃等省森林很少，疏松的黄土遇到西北常见的暴雨，便形成严重的水土流失现象。据调查，在黄河中游三十七万平方公里地区内，平均每年每平方公里要流失三千七百吨泥沙。这些泥沙的流失，便是黄河中游旱灾和下游水灾频起的根本原因。解放以后，黄河流域的青海、甘肃、陕西、山西等六个省（自治区）人民已在水土保持方面作了不少努力，先后造林十五万公顷，封山育林一百多万公顷。青海省某些饮水稀少的地区由于封山育林和造林，现在不但人有水喝，地里也有水用了。甘肃省天水等地农民在坡地上栽种了洋槐等树木，现在没有山水冲坏坡田的事发生了。过去有些地区饲料、肥料、燃料缺乏的情况也得到初步改善，农、牧业生产都有发展。为了有计划地大规模地在黄土区域开展水土保持工作，以求改变黄河的历史面貌和提高人民生产和生活水平，会议认为，必须在水土流失严重的地区有重点地展开造林和封山育林工作。为此，陕西省须在陕北进一步营造防沙林，在洛河等河流上游营造水源林，并立即为营造这些森林作好准备工作。甘肃省须立即为泾河、渭河、祖厉河等河流上游营造水源林作好准备工作。山西省须立即为汾河和晋西各河上游营造水源林作好准备工作。河南省须立即为伊河、洛河的水源林和黄河北岸造林作好准备工作。青海省须立即为湟水营造水源林作好准备工作。内蒙古自治区也须为在西部营造防护林、在乌拉山和大黑河上游营造水源林作好准备工作。上述重点造林地区应根据开发和治理黄河的要求，结合山区生产规划，首先完成概况调查，以便合理地划分农、林、牧生产区域，安排水土保持工作。会议要求：开展造林和封山育林工作中，必须依靠互助合作组织，并促进互助合作运动的发展。无论是开展水土保持或是造林、封山育林，都要求集体行动、共同经营。此外，会议还要求各地建立林业专业机构，保护现有森林，准备苗木和种子，加强试验研究工作，以适应黄河流域大规模造林和封山育林的需要。　（新华社）
