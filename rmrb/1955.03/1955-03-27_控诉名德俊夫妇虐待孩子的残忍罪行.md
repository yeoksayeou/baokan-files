Title: Accusation of the Cruel Crimes of Abuse Against Children by the Ming Dejun Couple

To the Editors:

    With extreme indignation, we are reporting to the Party newspaper the cruel abuse of their four-year-old daughter, Yuping, by Ming Dejun and his wife, Yang Shulan, who are cadres working in state organs.

    Ming Dejun and his wife, Yang Shulan, have three children in total. The eldest daughter, Yuping, had been living with her maternal grandmother. It was only in the late seventh lunar month of 1954 that the grandmother personally brought her to Beijing. According to general reasoning, parents should show extra care for their flesh and blood after being separated for several years. However, the mother, Yang Shulan, was different. From the first day Yuping arrived in Beijing, the child's tender skin was constantly tortured by Yang Shulan. Until they were transferred to Fengtai to work in mid-January of this year, Yuping's body, cheeks, and buttocks were covered with bruises.

    Initially, Ming Dejun was relatively good to Yuping, but Yang Shulan would pout and get angry because of this. Once, because Ming Dejun refused to hit Yuping, Yang Shulan refused to feed the youngest child breast milk for a whole day. Later, Ming Dejun, who lacked principles, gradually became like Yang Shulan and abused Yuping.

    The shameful behavior of Ming Dejun and his wife in abusing Yuping is extremely infuriating. Usually, when they were unhappy, they would take it out on Yuping. They would often strip her of her clothes, shoes, and socks and force her to kneel on the cold cement floor. They wouldn't let her sleep even at midnight. In winter, Yang Shulan often made Yuping warm her ice-cold feet. If she wasn't pleased, Yang Shulan would kick the child off the bed with her leg, making her sleep on the cement floor.

    When the couple beat Yuping, they wouldn't allow her to cry. If she opened her mouth to cry, Ming Dejun would spit phlegm and blow his nose into her mouth. Even more barbaric was that one night during a heavy snowfall, they stripped the child of her clothes and chased her into the courtyard, which was so cold that water dripped and froze. A resident of the same courtyard saw something moving in the yard while going to the toilet. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be poor Yuping. She was shivering all over, completely frozen. On the evening of December 24th, Yang Shulan stuffed the child's mouth, and Ming Dejun used a red-hot iron bar to burn Yuping's thigh, leaving a scar more than two inches long.

    When Yuping first arrived last year, she was a very clever and intelligent child. Now, she has been tortured into a dull-witted state, unwilling to go to places where there are people, and only looking for cold, empty rooms to hide in. When she couldn't bear the abuse anymore, she said sadly: "It's better to go outside and be run over by a car, I can't live anymore!"

    We live in the same courtyard as Ming Dejun and Yang Shulan. Since Yuping came, we have often heard her miserable cries and often seen their nanny crying for this unfortunate child. We have suggested to Yang Shulan that she stop, but she not only didn't listen but also adopted a hostile attitude towards others, shamelessly saying, "The child is mine, I can beat my child, it's none of anyone else's business." Ming Dejun also said, "Is it a big deal to 'tease' a child? Don't parents have the freedom to 'tease' their children?"

    Children are the flowers of humanity, the second generation of the country, and the reserve force for building a socialist and communist society. Our country stipulated in the Marriage Law promulgated in April 1950 that "Parents have the obligation to raise and educate their children; children have the obligation to support and assist their parents; neither party shall abuse or abandon the other." Our Constitution also stipulates that "Marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state." The abuse of children by Ming Dejun and his wife is clearly an illegal act. It is said that Ming Dejun participated in revolutionary work as early as 1938. He is a Communist Party member and has always been engaged in political work; Yang Shulan has also participated in revolutionary work for several years. As cadres, they are so cold and ruthless to their own children, who can believe that they have any feelings for the masses and the revolutionary cause? But strangely, the relevant leadership only gave a very light punishment to Ming Dejun, who has lost his communist morality, and no punishment at all to Yang Shulan, who encouraged her husband to abuse the child. We are very dissatisfied with this handling. In order to educate Ming Dejun and Yang Shulan to effectively correct their mistakes and protect the next generation of the country, we hope that the relevant authorities can handle this issue more seriously.

### 控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的残忍罪行

    控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的残忍罪行编辑同志：
    我们以万分愤激的心情，向党报检举国家机关工作干部名德俊夫妇残忍虐待自己四岁多的小女孩——玉平的事情。
    名德俊和他的爱人杨淑兰一共有三个孩子。大女儿玉平一直在姥姥家里生活。一九五四年阴历七月下旬，姥姥才亲自送她到北京来。照一般情理来说，父母对于离别几年的亲骨肉，总会倍加爱护的。可是，杨淑兰这个母亲却与众不同，从玉平来到北京的第一天起，这个孩子身上的嫩皮肉就不断遭到杨淑兰的折磨，一直到今年一月中旬他们调到丰台去工作时，玉平身上、腮帮子上和屁股上到处有着青一块、紫一块的伤痕。
    开始，名德俊对玉平还是比较好的，但杨淑兰却因此噘着嘴生气。有一次因为名德俊不肯打玉平，杨淑兰就一天不给最小的孩子吃奶。以后，没有原则的名德俊，就渐渐变得像杨淑兰一样，虐待玉平了。
    名德俊夫妇虐待玉平的可耻行为，是十分令人痛愤的。平时，他们一不高兴，就拿玉平出气，动不动就把她的衣服鞋袜脱光了，罚她跪在冰冷的水泥地上。深夜十二点钟了，还不让她睡觉。冬天睡觉时，杨淑兰经常把冰凉的脚要玉平给暖。一不顺意，杨淑兰腿一伸就把孩子踢下床去，让孩子睡在水泥地上。
    他们夫妇在打玉平的时候，还不准她哭；如果她张口一哭，名德俊就向她嘴里吐痰擤鼻涕。更野蛮的是有一次在大雪天的夜里，他们竟剥光了孩子的衣服，把她撵到滴水成冰的院子里去挨冻。同院住的一个人在上厕所的时候，看见院里有一个东西在动；走近去一看，原来是可怜的玉平。她已经被冻得浑身冰冷，直打哆嗦。十二月二十四日晚上，杨淑兰把孩子的嘴堵上，名德俊用烧红的铁条烫玉平的大腿，留下了过两寸长的伤痕。
    玉平去年刚来的时候，本来是一个很灵巧、很聪明的孩子。现在这个孩子被他们折磨得呆头呆脑，不愿意到有人的地方去，专找没人的冷屋子钻了。在她被虐待得受不了时，曾伤心地说：还不如到外面去让汽车把我压死，我活不下去了！
    我们和名德俊、杨淑兰住在一个院子里，从玉平来后，常常听到她凄惨的哭声，也常常看见他家的保姆为这个遭难的孩子而流泪。我们曾经向杨淑兰提过意见，她不但不听，反而对别人采取仇视的态度，竟厚颜无耻地说：“孩子是我生的，我打我的孩子，别人管不着。”名德俊也说：“逗逗”孩子有什么了不起，难道父母“逗”孩子也没有自由了吗？
    儿童是人类的花朵，是国家的第二代，是建设社会主义、共产主义社会的后备军。我们的国家早在一九五○年四月公布的婚姻法中，就规定了“父母对于子女有抚养教育的义务；子女对于父母有赡养扶助的义务；双方均不得虐待或遗弃。”我们的宪法中也规定了“婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。”名德俊夫妇对于孩子的虐待，显然是一种违法行为。据说名德俊在一九三八年就参加革命工作了，他是一个共产党员，而且又一直是做政治工作的；杨淑兰也曾参加革命工作好几年。作为一个干部，他们对于自己亲生的孩子竟然这样冷酷无情，谁能相信他们对待群众和革命事业能有什么感情呢？但是令人奇怪的是有关领导方面对于一个丧失共产主义道德的名德俊只给了一个很轻微的处分，对于怂恿丈夫虐待孩子的杨淑兰却根本没有处分，我们十分不满意这种处理。为了教育名德俊和杨淑兰切实改正错误，保障国家的后一代，希望有关机关能更加严肃的处理这个问题。
