Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 19th. In early February, the people of Zhejiang Province formed a delegation to visit and express their regards to the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Zhejiang. This慰问 activity has recently concluded successfully. This慰问 further encouraged the soldiers on the coastal defense front in their determination to liberate Taiwan.

The representatives of the delegation, along with the accompanying theatrical troupes, ballad singing, and film projection teams, spent more than a month深入 on the coastal defense front, warmly慰问 the land, sea, and air forces who liberated Yijiangshan Island and Dachen Island and sank the Chiang bandit gang's "Taiping" and "Dongting" warships. They慰问 the commanders and fighters guarding the coastal defense front, as well as the sick and wounded who were gloriously injured or suffered from overwork in the battles to liberate the coastal islands. The delegation held hundreds of慰问 meetings in various places, expressing the deep concern of the more than 20 million people of the province for them, and presenting and conveying a large number of慰问 letters and慰问 items from the whole province and across the country. The representatives went deep into the companies and wards, shaking hands warmly with the commanders and fighters. The representatives visited with great respect a company that planted the red flag on Yijiangshan Island only twenty minutes after landing. All the soldiers in this company were subsequently awarded first-class merit, and also received a prize banner from the higher leading organs.

The front-line troops have guarded the coastal defense day and night for several years, regardless of wind and rain and freezing cold, which deeply moved the representatives. The representatives are determined to convey the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army to the people of the whole province, so that the broad masses of people can better learn from the People's Liberation Army. The enthusiastic慰问 of the delegation greatly encouraged the will and determination of all the officers and soldiers to defend the motherland and liberate Taiwan. The soldiers said: The慰问团 has brought us infinite strength. We must practice our skills well so that the sacred territory of our motherland, Taiwan, can be liberated as soon as possible. Many soldiers also gave many meaningful gifts to the慰问团.
