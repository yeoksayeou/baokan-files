Mountain Fires are the Enemy of the Forest
Lin Ying
    The dry grass and windy spring season has arrived. A fierce enemy is increasingly threatening the country's precious forest resources, and that is mountain fires.
    Recent news from Guangdong Province illustrates the severity of the damage caused by mountain fires. In Yunan County, Guangdong Province, three districts experienced two major mountain fires around January 20th due to farmers burning mountains for land reclamation and neglecting fire prevention. According to estimates of the damage in only four townships in the Fourth District, the mountain fires destroyed 100,000 large pine trees, 10 million small pine trees, 10,000 large and small fir trees, and 13,000 Masson pine trees; about 20,000 chestnut trees were burned down in the Bianmin Township of the Second District. According to a report from the Guangdong Yuezhong Forest Fire Prevention Command: In the first two weeks of January this year, a total of 584 mountain fires occurred in more than 110 townships in ten counties including Huaiji and Guangning; the area of mountain forest burned by the fires reached approximately 100,890 mu, equivalent to one-fifth of the planned afforestation area in the Yuezhong area this year; millions of pine, fir, bamboo, tea and other trees were burned to death!
    This is truly heartbreaking!
    Timber is one of the most important resources for realizing national industrialization, and it also plays a significant role in resisting natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and sand, and in promoting bumper harvests of agricultural crops. The proportion of forest area in our country's total land area is very small, and forest resources are increasingly unable to keep up with the needs of national construction and the people. Therefore, on the one hand, we must vigorously carry out afforestation; on the other hand, we must do everything possible to protect existing forest resources. This is a simple truth, but unfortunately, not everyone has understood it. In specific work, there are still some incorrect ideas that hinder forestry work from achieving its due effect.
    The leading organs in some areas put forestry work in opposition to agricultural production; instead of taking both into consideration, they attend to one thing and lose sight of the other. Some people even believe that organizing forestry protection will affect production, so they adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards forestry work. As a result, in these areas, mountain fires are unavoidable; not only do they cause losses to the country's forest resources, but also hinder agricultural production because putting out fires consumes a lot of manpower. That is to say, in areas with forests, forestry work should be closely integrated with agricultural production, so as not to affect production due to fires. From a long-term perspective, if forests are damaged, natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and sand will become serious, threatening and hindering agricultural harvests. It can be seen that doing a good job in forestry protection is beneficial to ensuring the development of agricultural production.
    In some areas, especially in the South, there is a phenomenon of "emphasizing afforestation and neglecting forestry protection." Cadres and the masses in these areas often relax the deployment and inspection of forestry protection work in order to carry out afforestation. As a result, on the one hand, they are busy with afforestation, and on the other hand, the original forests are being destroyed in large quantities. In 1954, the area of ​​forests burned down in some areas due to this reason was several times the area of ​​afforestation that year! The purpose of afforestation was originally to increase forest cover and expand the protective effect of forests; if these areas continue to do this, then before the newly planted trees grow, the original trees will be destroyed! Obviously, this erroneous practice must not continue.
    There is also a strange phenomenon in some areas: people only pay attention to protecting the original forests and do not pay attention to protecting newly planted trees; they only pay attention to protecting timber with higher utilization value and do not pay attention to protecting timber with lower utilization value. Obviously, this practice is wrong. It must be pointed out that any type of forest is worth cherishing for our country, which has too little forest area. Although some timber has lower utilization value, and some cannot even directly supply construction needs, any timber has a certain role in maintaining soil and water, resisting wind, sand, flood and drought disasters, ensuring agricultural production, and solving the problem of civilian timber use, so it must be protected.
    Party and government organs in mountain forest areas should earnestly implement the original Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Mobilizing the Masses to Carry Out Afforestation, Forest Cultivation, and Forest Protection," and effectively carry out forestry work. At present, this work should be listed as one of the important seasonal tasks, with unified planning and arrangements, so that forestry protection work can be organically coordinated with various productions. In order to make forestry fire prevention work a mass movement in mountain forest areas, it is necessary to strengthen publicity and education, resolutely implement the principle of "universal forestry protection and mountain protection" and "prevention is better than cure," establish effective forestry protection organizations and responsibility systems, and regularly organize inspections to plug all loopholes that may cause fires and damage forests.

    山火是森林的敌人
    林营
    草干风大的春季到来了。一个凶恶的敌人越来越厉害地威胁着国家宝贵的森林资源，这就是山火。
    最近来自广东地区的消息，说明了山火为害的严重情况。广东省郁南县的三个区，由于农民烧山垦荒，忽视防火，在一月二十日前后连续发生了两次大山火。仅据第四区四个乡受害情况估计，山火烧毁大松十万棵，小松一千万棵，大小杉树一万棵，大头松一万三千棵；第二区便民乡烧毁的栗子树约有二万棵。据广东粤中护林防火指挥部的报告：在今年一月的头两旬中，怀集、广宁等十个县、一百一十多个乡共发生山火五百八十四起；山火烧毁的山林面积约达十万零八千九百多亩，等于粤中区今年计划造林面积的五分之一；烧死的松、杉、竹、茶等树有数百万棵！
    这是多么令人痛心的事！
    林木是实现国家工业化最重要的资源之一，对于抗御水、旱、风、砂等自然灾害，促成农作物丰收也有重大作用。我们国家的森林面积在全国土地面积中所占的比例非常的小，森林资源已经越来越赶不上国家建设和人民的需要。因此，我们一方面必须大力造林；一方面还必须尽一切力量，把现有的森林资源保护好。这是一个平凡的道理，可惜并不是所有的人都已懂得了这个道理。在具体工作中，还有一些不正确的思想，阻碍着护林工作达到应有的效果。
    有些地区的领导机关，把护林工作跟农业生产对立起来；不是统筹兼顾，而是顾此失彼。有些人甚至认为组织护林就会影响生产，就对护林工作采取放任自流的态度。结果，在这些地区，山火就难免发生；不仅使国家森林资源遭受损失，而且由于扑救火灾耗费很多人力，也就妨碍了农业生产。这就是说，在有森林的地区，应该把护林工作和农业生产密切结合起来，才不致因发生火灾而影响生产。从长远利益来看，如果森林遭受破坏，水、旱、风、砂等自然灾害就会严重起来，威胁和妨害农业的收成。可见做好护林工作，对保证农业生产的发展是有好处的。
    有些地区，特别是南方，存在着“重视造林，轻视护林”的现象。这些地区的干部和群众为了造林，经常放松护林工作的布置和检查，结果一面是忙于造林，一面是原有的森林被大量破坏。一九五四年，有些地区由于这种原因被烧毁的森林面积，竟相当当年造林面积的好几倍！造林的目的本来是为了增加森林覆被率，扩大森林的防护作用；照这些地区的这种样子做下去，那么，不等新造的林木长成，原有的林木就被毁光了！很明显，这种错误的做法，决不能再继续下去。
    部分地区还有这样一种奇怪现象：人们只重视保护原有的森林，不注意保护新植的树木；只重视保护利用价值较高的林木，不注意保护利用价值较低的林木。显然，这种做法是不对的。必须指出，任何树种的森林，对于森林面积太小的我国来说，都是值得珍视的。虽然有的林木利用价值较低，有的甚至不能直接供应建筑需要，但是，任何林木在保持水土、抵抗风砂水旱灾害、保障农业生产和解决民间用材方面，都有一定的作用，因此都是必须予以保护的。
    山林地区的党和政府机关应当认真执行原政务院“关于发动群众开展造林、育林、护林工作的指示”，把护林工作有效地开展起来。在目前，更要把这一工作列为季节性的重要工作之一，统一计划，统一安排，使护林工作和各项生产有机地配合起来。为了使护林防火工作成为山林地区的群众性的运动，必须加强宣传教育，坚决贯彻“普遍护林护山”和“防胜于救”的方针，建立起有效的护林组织和责任制度，经常组织检查，堵塞一切可能引起火灾和破坏森林的漏洞。
