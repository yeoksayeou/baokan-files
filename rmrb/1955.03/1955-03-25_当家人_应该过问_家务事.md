"Heads of Household" Should Intervene in "Household Affairs"
		Bo Wei

    Recently, when many regions inspected the phenomenon of wasting food, they discovered a fairly common problem: in many government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools, the purchase and use of grain have long been in a chaotic state of no one being responsible and no one supervising.

    The canteen of the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance submitted a grain purchase plan to the grain department for 100 people in January of this year. In reality, only 71 people ate in this canteen. In February, even fewer people ate in the canteen, but the grain purchase plan still stated 100 people! What's going on? Take a look at how the grain purchase plan for this agency is compiled, and you'll understand.

    It turns out that the grain purchase plan of the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance has no responsible cadre in charge at all. An administrative secretary is authorized to review the grain purchase plan. However, this secretary did not take responsibility; he handed his seal to the mess hall administrator. The mess hall administrator "reviewed and approved" the grain purchase plan drafted by himself every month, then stamped it with the secretary's seal, and the whole procedure was completed.

    Such a situation of falsely reporting the number of people and receiving more grain is by no means limited to the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance. For example, the Xinjiang Textile Factory in Shanxi Province uses the method of impersonation to purchase 200 people's worth of grain every month. Some people not only are not ashamed of this behavior of obtaining grain from the state, but they also say it is "improving the lives of employees."

    People will ask, haven't the heads of these units seen these bad phenomena?

    The problem lies here. Many unit leaders, especially leading cadres responsible for administrative work, regard the implementation of the grain supply system and the use of grain as "trivial matters of life" that are not worth intervening in, thinking that these "household affairs" can be left to the administrative staff who manage the food.

    Of course, buying grain and eating is indeed a matter of life. However, this kind of life problem can lead to violations of the state's grain policy and the waste of grain because the leading cadres do not intervene, creating a bad influence among the masses. Can we simply say that it is a matter of life or a "small matter"? Can we not intervene in advance?

    "Heads of household" should intervene in such "household affairs" as the purchase and use of grain in their own units. This, of course, does not mean that the head of a unit must be like a housekeeper, directly handling grain, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, etc. every day, but rather that he should provide necessary leadership, inspection, and supervision for the purchase and use of grain in his own unit, and should conduct education on abiding by the state's grain policy and saving grain among his staff. This is entirely the duty of the leaders.

    “当家人”应该过问“家务事”
    泊微
    最近，许多地区在检查浪费粮食现象的时候，发现了一个带有相当普遍性的问题，这就是：许多机关、团体、企业和学校，粮食的购买和使用，长期处于无人负责、无人监督的混乱状态。
    甘肃省财政厅的食堂在今年一月份向粮食部门提出了供应一百人的购粮计划，实际上，在这个食堂吃饭的只有七十一个人。二月份，在食堂吃饭的人更少了，但购粮计划上还是写着一百人！这是怎末一回事呢？看看这个机关编制购粮计划的经过就知道了。
    原来，甘肃省财政厅食堂的购粮计划，根本没有一定的负责干部加以掌握。一个事务秘书受权审查购粮计划。但这位秘书并没有负起责任，他把自己的印章交给了伙食管理员。伙食管理员每月自己“审查批准”自己起草的购粮计划，然后盖上那位秘书的印章，全部程序就算完成了。
    像这样虚报人数，多领粮食的情况，决不限于甘肃省财政厅一个单位。如山西省新绛纺织厂每月都用冒名顶替的方法，多购二百个人的粮食。有些人对于这种向国家套购粮食的行为，不但不以为耻，反而说是“改善职工生活”。
    人们会问，难道这些单位的负责人没有看见这种不良现象吗？
    问题就在这里。不少单位的负责人，特别是负责行政工作的领导干部，把执行粮食供应制度和使用粮食的事情，看做不屑过问的“生活琐事”，认为这类“家务事”交给管理伙食的事务工作人员就行了。
    当然，买粮、吃饭，确是生活问题。但是，这种生活问题会因领导干部不过问而引起违反国家粮食政策和浪费粮食的现象，在群众中造成恶劣的影响。我们能单纯说它是生活问题或“小事”吗？我们能不事先加以过问吗？
    “当家人”应该过问本单位购粮用粮这样的“家务事”。这当然不是说一个单位的负责人必须像管家婆那样，天天去直接操办粮草油盐酱醋等等事情，而是说，他应该对于本单位购买和使用粮食的事情，加以必要的领导、检查和监督，应该向所属工作人员进行关于遵守国家粮食政策和节约粮食的教育。这完全是领导人员分内的事。
