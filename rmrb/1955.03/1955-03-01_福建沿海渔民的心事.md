The Worries of Fishermen Along the Fujian Coast
　　Zeng Yuqiu

Every day, fishermen returning from the streams and the sea in Baishi Town, Xiaqi Township, Fuan, Fujian, bring fresh fish to the town, and then carry bags or buckets full of white rice back to their boats to cook fragrant white rice. Fishermen walking on the street, the men wear Western-style shirts, and the women wear brightly colored clothes with floral patterns. The fishermen on the boats often sing and laugh loudly. This prosperous scene has aroused many feelings in the fisherman Chen Qingdi. He said that when he was squeezed into the crowd to buy rice, he couldn't help but think: "How many fishermen couldn't afford rice in the past? Now so many people are buying rice!"

The fishermen of Xiaqi Township all remember: the heartbreaking "Year Thirty-Two of the Republic of China," that unforgettable year of famine. The year before was a drought, and the following year there was a shortage of grain. Fishermen floating on the water were even worse off in famine years, it was truly "fish as cheap as sand." Taking more than ten catties of fish to the street could not even buy a catty of rice. Chen Qingdi was only fifteen years old at the time. In his "home," a boat housed a large group of people, including parents, uncles, and brothers and sisters, a total of eighteen people. If they couldn't exchange fish for rice, the family had to eat sweet potato leaves and wild vegetables. He was young and ignorant and cried out in hunger, "Why can't we buy rice?" The elders said, "Go and see for yourself!" He went to Baishi Street and saw that the street was empty, with no rice to be found! Those black-hearted grain merchants, seeing the rice shortage, had long since turned their "rice bins upside down."

In the famine year, there was no place to buy rice. Hunger made families cry and weep. Looking at the river, there were boats full of grain, being transported elsewhere by the pseudo-county magistrate Gao Tingxue and the big rice merchants to do business and make big money. Qingdi's family ate wild vegetables for eleven days straight. Eating them for too long was not sustainable, and members of the family fell ill one after another. Watching those landlords and unscrupulous merchants who hoarded grain and refused to sell it eating high-quality white rice, even their dogs were well-fed, they held onto the grain and refused to sell it. In thirty-one days, half starving and half sick, his father, mother, and grandmother died one after another, a total of eleven people, leaving only a large group of small children.

It wasn't just Qingdi's family that starved to death! Almost every boat had people who starved to death. Lin Liushou's family had six people. During the famine, suffering from hunger and with no way out, he jumped into the stream and committed suicide. The family didn't even have money for a proper burial, so they just wrapped him in a straw mat. In just one township, dozens of people died like this!

In 1953, there was a drought for seventy days, and everyone on the fishing boats started whispering, "Grain prices are probably going to rise again!" "If the sun bakes this year, grain prices will be strange next year!" They thought of the "old rules" of not being able to buy grain during previous famines and couldn't help but worry.

But it was truly "strange"! A month, two months passed, and grain prices did not move. It turned out that the state had secured enough grain. The fishermen said, "In the past, even if you had money, there was nowhere to buy rice!" Some said, "In the past, it would have risen to who knows what price!" An old man with a white beard on the fishing boat sighed, "I've never seen anything like this before!"

After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, stable grain prices brought unprecedented good times to the fishermen. In 1953, one dan of rice cost 102,000 yuan in old currency, and now it's basically the same. Almost every household has fragrant and soft white rice to eat. Catching fish and selling it for money means you can buy rice to bring back. That kind of blood-sucking grain usury will never happen again. Chen Qingdi said, "In the past, ten catties of fish could only be exchanged for three or four catties of millet; now ten catties of fish can be exchanged for fifteen catties of rice. In the past, it took eleven or twelve catties of fish to exchange for one chi of serge, now five or six catties of fish can exchange for one chi. In the past, we ate millet, now we have white rice to eat." The whole township was supplied with millet and white rice, and the state not only didn't make money from the people but also lost money. The state has put all its effort into ensuring the people's lives. As the saying goes, "Someone will do a business that can lead to execution, but no one will do a business at a loss." Only private merchants were like that!

The fishermen's enthusiasm for production is even higher. This year's production has increased by 30% compared to previous years. In the past, they would go out and come back quickly, now they go out early and return late, and some people even fish at night! There are rows of fishing boats on the streams and rivers; Xiaqi Township has built forty-two new boats; and the fishing gear has also increased a lot. In the past, there were no fishing nets, now there are already thirty fishing nets.

The lives of the fishermen on the southeast coast are improving every day. Their worry is no longer the question of "can we buy rice or not." They now must always remember the important responsibility of liberating Taiwan. Chen Qingdi said, "We must also save food. The kind of hard days we had in the past when we had nothing to eat will never come again, but we must think of our brothers and sisters in Taiwan who are still living those hard days!"

    福建沿海渔民的心事
    曾毓秋
    每天，福建福安下歧乡白石镇上都有从溪里、海里回来的渔民，把活鲜鲜的鱼送到镇上去，然后又提着满袋或者满桶的白米回到船上，煮香喷喷的白米饭吃。在街上走着的渔民，男人穿的是洋布衫，妇女们还穿上鲜花朵朵的衣裳。船上的渔民不时地唱着歌，大声欢笑。这种兴旺景象，引起了渔民陈清弟好多感触。他说，当他挤在人群里买米的时候，禁不住想：“过去多少渔民买不起米啊，现在有这么多人买米了！”
    下歧乡的渔民们都记得：叫人伤心的“民国三十二年”，那个难忘的饥荒年，前年是旱，第二年缺粮。在水上漂的渔民碰到荒年就更糟了，真是“鱼贱如沙”。拿了十几斤鱼到街上去，还换不来一斤米。陈清弟当时才十五岁多。在他的“家”里，一只船上住着一大群人，上有父母叔伯，下有兄弟姐妹，总共十八口人。打来了鱼换不来米，一家人只好吃薯叶，吃野菜。他年纪小，不懂事，饿得难挨就哭喊：“为什么买不回米来？”老人说：“你自己去看看吧！”他到白石街一看，满街空荡荡的，哪里有米！那些黑心的粮商们看到米缺，早都是“米箩朝天”了。
    荒年，到哪里也买不到米。饿得东家哭，西家啼。站在河边上看，河里却是一条一条装满了粮食的船，那是伪县长高廷学和大米商们运到别处做生意、赚大钱去的。清弟家单是吃野菜当饭吃就吃了十一天。吃久了到底不行，家里的人一个接一个都病了。眼看着那些囤粮不卖的地主、奸商们吃的是上等白米饭，连家里的狗都吃得饱饱的，他们却捏住粮食不肯卖。三十一天里，一半饿，一半病，父亲、母亲、奶奶一个接一个地死去，总共死了十一个人，只剩下了一大堆小娃娃。
    饿死人的可不止清弟一家啊！每条船上差不多都饿死了人。林六寿家里有六口人，在荒年，饿得难受，没有路走，他就跳到溪里自杀了，家里连收埋的钱都没有，只用草席包了包就算了。只是一个乡就这样死了好几十个人！
    一九五三年大旱了七十天，每条渔船上都在叽咕起来了：“粮价怕又要往上涨了！”“今年太阳晒，明年粮价怪！”他们想到以前荒年买不到粮食的“老规矩”，不由得耽着心事。
    可是，真“怪”！一个月、两个月过去了，粮价不动。原来是国家掌握住了足够的粮食。渔民们说：“要是在过去呀，又是有钱没处买米了！”有的说：“要是在过去，早又不知涨成什么价了！”渔船上有个七十岁的白胡子的老人家感叹地说：“过去哪里见过这种事！”
    实行粮食统购统销以后，粮价平稳，给渔民带来了前所未有的好时光。一九五三年一担米旧币十万零二千元，现在基本上一样。差不多家家户户都有又香又软的白米饭吃。打上鱼，卖了钱，就可以买米回来。那种吃人血的粮食高利贷也不会再有了。陈清弟说：“过去十斤鱼，换三、四斤黍米；现在十斤鱼可以换十五斤米了。过去要十一、二斤鱼才换一尺哔叽，现在五、六斤鱼就能换一尺。过去吃黍米，现在有白米吃了。”全乡供应了黍米和白米，国家不但不赚人民的钱，并且还赔了钱。国家为了保障人民生活真是什么心力都使到了。常言道：“杀头生意有人作，亏本生意没人作。”只有私商才是那样的啊！
    渔民的生产情绪更高了。今年的生产比往年提高了百分之三十，过去快去快回，现在早去晚归，晚上还有人打鱼哩！溪河上有一排排的渔船；下歧乡新造的船就有四十二条；渔具也增加了很多，过去没有渔袋，现在已经有了三十条渔袋。
    在东南沿海的渔民生活都是天天向上的。他们的心事，不再是“买到米买不到米”的问题了。他们现在不能不时时刻刻记着解放台湾的重大责任。陈清弟说：“我们还要节约粮食。我们过去那种没有吃的苦日子是不会再来了，可是，不能不想到，台湾的弟兄们还在过着那苦日子啊！”
