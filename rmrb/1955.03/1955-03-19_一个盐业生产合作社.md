    A Salt Production Cooperative
    Lin Jianzheng
    On the right bank of Tieshan Port in Guangxi Province, there is a stone embankment like a city wall, shielding the 40,000 mu of salt fields within from the roaring waves of Tokyo Bay. This is the common property of the more than 270 members of the Lanzi Gen Salt Production Cooperative in Hepu County.
    In the past, this place was a mudflat overgrown with mangroves. Salt farmers toiled for generations, building the salt fields stone by stone, load of soil by load of soil. However, the salt fields belonged to the landlords. The landlords said, "Salt means rent; if it's damaged, we don't care!" The salt farmers had to fight barehanded against the frequent typhoons and giant tides. For many years, the salt fields here were always broken and repaired, repaired and broken, with clusters of mangroves constantly growing out of the dilapidated salt fields. Therefore, people called it "Lanzi Gen" (Mangrove Root) Salt Field.
    At that time, salt farmers had to pay eighty jin of rent for every hundred jin of salt they produced. Many salt farmers lived in damp, broken warehouses in winter and in open grass in summer, living a poor life of insufficient food and inadequate clothing. In those years, everyone wanted to produce more salt, but unexpected typhoons and giant tides became disasters that the salt farmers could not resist. For decades, every time after a typhoon, the sixty-year-old salt farmer Zhou Huasheng would stand by the sea and sigh at the rolling waves, "When can we build a large embankment here?" But year after year, what remained were those increasingly broken, intermittent mud foundations.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the salt farmers victoriously carried out the anti-feudal struggle and organized themselves to collectively repair the foundations and restore production. The state also announced that the salt fields would be handed over to the salt farmers to use. In the second half of 1952, the salt farmers responded to the government's call and organized six mutual aid teams, which were later gradually improved and transformed into the current production cooperative.
    During the preparation for the establishment of the cooperative, a seventy-year-old salt farmer named Zhou Dingfang, who had no children, always sighed, worried that the cooperative would not want him. The cadres in charge of building the cooperative went to him, and he asked in disbelief, "The cooperative pays according to labor. What can I do at my age?" The cadres said to him, "You have decades of experience in salt production, watching the weather, managing the water, and thinking of ways are also labor!" After Zhou Dingfang was admitted to the cooperative, he was very excited. On the day the production cooperative was established, he danced home with the young people.
    The cooperative director, Li Huixiang, had been drying salt in this area for twenty years. At that time, salt was worthless. At its cheapest, one hundred jin of salt could only be exchanged for one jin of rice. Sometimes, his family of seven had to pick mangrove fruits or dig up insect shells in the mudflats to fill their stomachs, and the whole family suffered from edema. Li Huixiang often said fiercely, "One day I will leave this terrible 'mud' land." After liberation, he realized that it was not the terrible "mud" land that made him poor, but the cruel feudal system. Therefore, when the anti-feudal democratic movement was launched in the salt area, he actively participated in the struggle; when the mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched, he took the lead. Now he loves this "mud" land more and more. Whether it is day or night, he is often seen running around in the dozens of miles of salt fields, enthusiastically discussing production problems with the members.
    In late August 1954, there was a severe storm, but thanks to the timely forecast by the weather-watching team in the cooperative, everyone was able to overcome the disaster with full preparation. After the storm, the members lit gas lamps and repaired the foundations and watered overnight, striving to start drying three days after the storm, without delaying production.
    At noon on October 23, 1954, a force four wind blew across the field, and the loudspeaker could not be heard. A member ran back to the production team breathlessly from the field, saying that the pond was about to collapse—if the inner base of the pond collapsed due to water erosion, the seawater filled in the pond would flow down the terrain to the lower evaporation ponds and crystallization ponds, and all the salt in the ponds would quickly dissolve. Li Huixiang quickly took a few people and ran towards the pond, and the members working in the field also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. It is true that with many people working together, there is great strength, and the pond base was quickly blocked.
    Through these many facts, the members realized the truth that man can conquer nature, increased their confidence in overcoming difficulties, and at the same time broke with conservative ideas, eliminated "bittern" (the residual water left after seawater crystallizes into salt, which in the past salt farmers mixed with fresh brine, affecting the quality of the salt), and improved the quality of the salt. In addition, more than ten advanced experiences such as "anti-large dregs" (extending the crystallization time from one or two days to three or five days) were promoted, so that the salt production increased year by year. In the eighteen days of October 1954, the salt production was seven thousand dan more than in the same period of 1953, while the sunshine hours were eight hours less than in 1953.
    In the past, this salt field had an annual output of less than 40,000 dan, but now it can produce 350,000 dan. Now, the cooperative has a clinic and a cultural school, and more than 30 newspapers are subscribed. The 18-kilometer-long stone embankment that the salt farmers had been yearning for for years has also been built. This year, the cooperative plans to invest 80,000 yuan to expand production equipment.
    The lives of the members are also improving day by day with the development of production. In 1952, the average monthly income per person in the whole cooperative was 28 yuan in new currency, which increased to 48 yuan in 1953; in 1954, it increased to 86 yuan. Li Zuqin, who had lived in a broken warehouse all his life, built five tile houses last year. Li Dingliang's family of five bought ten zhang of cloth and one hundred and ten jin of pork last year. When the state issued economic construction bonds last year, the whole cooperative subscribed for more than 3,000 yuan.

    一个盐业生产合作社
    林建征
    广西省铁山港的右岸，有一道好像城墙一样的石堤，挡着东京湾咆哮的海浪，护卫着堤内四万公亩盐田。这是合浦县榄子根盐业生产合作社二百七十多个社员的共同财产。
    过去，这地方是一片长满海榄树的泥滩，盐民们辛辛苦苦过了几个世代，才一块石、一挑土的修成了盐田。但是，盐田却归?主所有。?主说：“有盐就有租，破了咱不管！”盐民只好光着手跟不时袭来的台风和巨潮搏斗。多少年来，这里的盐田总是破了又补，补了又破，丛丛的海榄树不断地从破烂的盐田中生长起来，因此人们都叫它“榄子根”盐场。
    那时候，盐民生产一百斤盐要交八十斤租，不少盐民冬天住在阴湿的破仓里，夏天住在露天的草丛中，过着食不果腹、衣不遮体的穷日子。在那样的年头，谁都想着多产一斤盐，但是，意外的台风巨潮成了盐民无法抵挡的灾害。六十多岁的盐民周华生几十年来每当台风过后，总要站在海边上望着滚滚的波涛长叹着：“什么时候能在这里筑上一道大堤呢？”但是，年年躺在那里的仍是那些愈来愈破、断断续续的泥基。
    解放后，在党和政府的领导下，盐民们胜利地进行了反封建斗争，并且组织起来集体修基，恢复了生产。国家又宣布将盐田交给盐民使用。一九五二年下半年，盐民们响应政府号召，组织了六个互助组，后来逐步提高，改成了现在的生产合作社。
    在酝酿建立合作社的时候，有一位七十岁没儿没女的盐民周定芳，总叹气，担心合作社不要他。负责建社的干部去找他，他不相信地问：“合作社按劳取酬，我这么大年纪了能干什么？”干部对他说：“你有几十年的盐业生产经验，看天、掌水，想办法也是劳动呀！”周定芳被吸收入社后，情绪非常高，当庆祝生产合作社成立那天，他和青年人一块跳着舞回家。
    社主任李晖祥，二十年前就在这块地方晒盐。那时盐不值钱，最贱时，一百斤盐才换回一斤米。有时，他们全家七口人只得到泥滩摘海榄果或挖虫贝来充饥，吃得全家都得了水肿病。李晖祥经常发狠地说：“总要有一天我会离开这可怕的‘泥巴’地。”解放后，他才知道，让他穷困的不是这可怕的
  “泥巴”地，而是残酷的封建制度。于是盐区开展反封建的民主运动时，他积极参加斗争；开展互助合作运动时，他又起了带头作用。现在他愈来愈爱这块“泥巴”地，不论白天晚上，经常见他在几十里宽阔的盐田中跑来跑去，和社员们热烈地研究着生产中的问题。
    一九五四年八月下旬，发生过一次激烈的风暴，但是，由于社内看天小组及时预报，使大家能够在有充分准备的情况下战胜了这次灾害。风暴过后，社员们又点着汽灯连夜修基和上水，争取风后三天就开晒，没有耽误生产。
    在一九五四年十月二十三日中午，场地上又吹起了四级风，广播筒喊话都听不见了。一个社员气喘喘地从场地跑回生产组，说水塘快要崩基了——如果水塘的内基被水冲崩，水塘中蓄满的海水就会顺着地势向低处的蒸发池、结晶池流去，池里所有的盐就会很快溶解掉。李晖祥赶紧带了几个人朝水塘跑去，正在场地工作的社员也闻声赶到。真是人多心齐力量大，塘基很快就被堵住了。
    社员们通过这样许多事实，认识到人能胜天的道理，增加了克服困难的信心，同时又打破了保守思想，排除“苦卤”（海水结过盐后剩下的残水，过去盐民都把苦卤和鲜卤混在一起，影响盐的质量），提高了盐的质量。另外又推广了“抗大碴”（将结晶时间由一、二天延长到三、五天）等十多项先进经验，使盐的产量逐年提高。一九五四年十月份的十八天中比一九五三年同期多产盐七千担，而日晒时数反比一九五三年少八小时。
    过去这块盐场年产量不到四万担，现在能产三十五万担。现在，社内有了医务所，有了文化学校，光订阅的报纸就有三十多份。过去盐民们年年向往的伸延十八公里的石堤也修起来了。今年，社里又计划投资八万元来扩充生产设备。
    社员们的生活也随着生产的发展日益提高。一九五二年全社每人每月的平均收入合新币二十八元，一九五三年就增加到四十八元；一九五四年又增到八十六元。住了一辈子破仓的李祖勤，去年一连盖了五间瓦房。李定良一家五口人，去年一年内买了十丈布和一百一十斤猪肉。去年国家发行经济建设公债时，全社认购了三千多元。
