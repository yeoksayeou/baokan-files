Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once again threatened at a press conference on the 15th that the United States would use armed forces to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, and "related areas."

When asked by a reporter whether he agreed with the British Foreign Secretary Eden's proposal to "renounce the use of force" and achieve a "ceasefire" in the Taiwan area, Dulles confirmed that the United States "welcomed" such a proposal because it was a tactic to facilitate further American aggression against China. Dulles said that Eden's proposal "would meet the immediate needs of the situation." As for the long term, Dulles continued, even if this proposal were realized, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique would not need to abandon its "legitimate claims" and legitimate "rights." In reality, it means that the United States will not abandon its right to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to re-occupy the whole of China.

Dulles threatened again that the United States was prepared to expand its aggression to the islands along the Chinese mainland coast. He said that when signing the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," the United States had, after "repeated deliberation," "excluded Jinmen and Mazu Islands from the treaty area," but he had recently "consulted" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taipei, and had estimated that "the President might determine… the need to defend Jinmen and Mazu Islands."

Dulles also indicated that the United States intends to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the Syngman Rhee clique in its conspiracy to expand its aggression against China from three fronts: Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Dulles also defended the recent repeated calls by the U.S. side for action to intercept the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba," which was sailing to China, claiming that according to the United Nations embargo resolution (an illegal resolution passed under U.S. manipulation), the interception action "cannot be regarded as an act of war."

Dulles vociferated about atomic warfare at this press conference to intimidate the people of all countries. He said that the U.S. "strategic forces with high air and sea attack capabilities" stationed in the Far East and Southeast Asia regions have been equipped with atomic weapons. At the same time, when talking about the European region, he said that certain types of atomic weapons are becoming "conventional weapons" for the U.S. armed forces.

    杜勒斯再次叫嚣侵略我国
    【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯十五日在记者招待会上又一次恫吓说，美国要用武装部队来阻挠中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和
  “有关地区”。
    在被记者问到他是否同意英国外交大臣艾登所提的在台湾地区“放弃使用武力”，实现“停火”的主张时，杜勒斯证实美国“欢迎”这样的主张，因为它是便利美国进一步侵略中国的一种手法。杜勒斯说艾登的主张“将满足局势的眼前需要”。至于就长远说来，杜勒斯接着说，即使这个主张实现，蒋介石卖国集团也没有必要放弃“合法要求”和合法“权利”。实际上，就是说美国将不放弃利用蒋介石卖国集团重新侵占整个中国的权利。
    杜勒斯再次威胁，美国准备把它的侵略扩大到中国大陆沿岸的岛屿。他说，在签订美蒋“共同防御条约”时，美国曾经经过“再三的思索考虑”，
  “把金门和马祖岛排除在条约区域之外”，但是他最近在台北同蒋介石卖国集团“进行磋商”时，又曾估计到，“（美国）总统可能断定……需要保卫金门和马祖岛。”
    杜勒斯还表示，在美国准备从台湾、南朝鲜和东南亚三条战线扩大对中国的侵略的阴谋中，要利用蒋介石卖国集团和李承晚集团。
    杜勒斯还为美国方面最近一再发出的要求采取行动来截扣正在驶往中国的芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”的叫嚣辩护，说什么根据联合国的禁运决议（这是在美国操纵下通过的非法决议），截扣的行动“不能算是战争行为”。
    杜勒斯在这次记者招待会上叫嚣原子战争来恫吓各国人民。他说，在远东和东南亚地区驻扎的美国“具有高度海空攻击力量的战略部队”已配备有原子武器。同时，他在谈到欧洲地区时说，某些种类的原子武器正在变成美国武装部队的“常规武器”。
