    Re-examining the "Special Nature" of Key Projects
    Wang Pu
    Recently, two comrades working on key projects wrote to say that they have encountered many people with a strong sense of being "special" in their daily lives. For example, when shopping at cooperatives or department stores, when there are too many customers and the staff are too busy to cope, these "special" key project builders will sternly reprimand them: "Do you have a concept of serving key projects?" If there is occasionally a meal with a bit of corn in the cafeteria, some people will get angry and slam their chopsticks on the table: "How can we build if we eat this kind of food?" When these people accept work assigned by the organization, they feel that since they are here to support key construction, their positions should be higher and their salaries should be higher. Once this is not the case, they are very frustrated: "Participating in key construction is not as good as my original place!" Or they say: "I came from afar with great enthusiasm to participate in key construction, and the country doesn't take care of me more!" In more serious cases, they even simply want to pack up and go home.
    These people are wrong because they misunderstood the special nature of key projects from the beginning. The characteristic of key projects is not, as they imagine, "being superior to others everywhere," but being more difficult and arduous than general work. Just imagine: starting from scratch, the factory buildings have not yet been built, and the machines have not yet been installed. Of course, it is impossible to build many department stores and cinemas first. When thousands of people suddenly increase in one area, suburban farmers will naturally not have prepared enough fresh vegetables in advance. The construction team is organized in a very short period of time, and personnel come from all directions, so it is difficult to arrange work and wages all at once reasonably. Building modern large-scale projects, without experience, is bound to go wrong; and when something goes wrong, it must be checked and criticized, so as to avoid causing further losses to the country. Key projects concentrate outstanding talents from various regions and fields. Those who used to lead others may now have to be led by others. The work is unfamiliar and complex, and almost everything must be learned from scratch. Those who were skilled and "stood out" in the past may now have to work hard and still not achieve results.
    Those who participate in the construction of key projects should be people who do not care about personal fame or gain, are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, are not arrogant in victory, are not discouraged in defeat, and are not intimidated by difficulties. Only such soldiers are worthy of being the main force on the industrial construction front. If one only focuses on personal fame, gain, and life, hoping that everything is prepared comfortably, completely, and satisfactorily, then one can only wait until everyone has completed the construction, industrialization has been achieved, and then go and enjoy the ready-made "blessings." To find such a key project to participate in "construction," I am afraid that even if you travel all over the country, you will "wear out your iron shoes and find nothing."
    Of course, the kind of people mentioned above are only a minority in our team. However, allowing this kind of thinking and emotion to spread freely will demoralize the army and affect morale. Therefore, the Party organizations of various key projects should pay attention to this issue and actively educate these people; advanced producers and advanced workers should lead the broad masses of workers to create public opinion and use righteousness to squeeze out these evil winds. And most importantly: the leading cadres of these key projects must set an example and first overcome the "special" thinking in their own minds.

### 再谈重点工程的“特殊性”

    再谈重点工程的“特殊性”
    王朴
    最近有两个在重点工程工作的同志来信说，他们在日常生活中间，碰到过不少“特殊感”很浓厚的人。例如，到合作社、百货公司买东西的时候，顾客太多，营业员忙不过来，这种“特殊”的重点工程建设者就声色俱厉地指责对方：“你们有没有为重点工程服务的观点？”食堂里偶尔有一顿饭夹了点玉米，就有人发起火来，把筷子往桌上一放：“吃这样的饭，怎么能建设？”这种人在接受组织分配工作的时候，觉得自己既然是来支援重点建设的，职位就应该高些，薪水就应该多些。而一旦不如愿，便十分懊恼：“参加重点建设，还不如原来那地方好呢！”或者说：“我满腔热忱，离乡背井来参加重点建设，国家也 不多照顾一下！”严重一点的，甚至干脆想卷铺盖回家了。
    这些人错在一开始就误解了重点工程的特殊性。重点工程的特点并不是像他们所想像的“处处高人一等”，而是比一般的工作要困难、艰苦。试想：平地起家，厂房还没有盖，机器还没有安，当然不可能先修很多百货公司、电影院。在一块地方突然增加成千上万的人，郊区农民自然不会预先就给准备好充足的新鲜菜蔬。建设者的队伍在很短的时间里组织起来，人员来自四面八方，工作的安排和工资待遇也难于一下子全都搞得很合理。建设现代化的大工程，没有经验，难免要出毛病；而出了毛病，就要检查、批评，以免再给国家造成损失。重点工程集中了各地区、各方面的优秀人材，原来领导别人的，现在就可能要受别人领导。工作生疏、复杂，几乎每样都要从头学起，过去工作熟练“出人头地”的，现在就可能费很大劲还做不出成绩来。
    参加重点工程建设的，应该是不计个人名利，不怕吃苦受累，胜不骄、败不馁，困难吓不倒的人，这样的战士才不愧为工业建设战线上的主力。如果只从个人名利和生活着眼，希望一切都准备得舒舒服服，齐齐全全，称心如意，那只有等大家建设好了，工业化实现了，去享现成的“福”。要想找这样一个重点工程去参加“建设”，恐怕是走遍全国也会是“踏破铁鞋无觅处”的。
    当然，前面所说的那种人，在我们的队伍中只是少数。但是，任凭这种思想情绪自由地蔓延发展，就会涣散军心，影响士气。所以，各个重点工程的党组织应该重视这个问题，积极地向这些人进行教育；先进生产者和先进的工作人员应该带动广大职工，造成舆论，用正气挤掉这些邪风。而最重要的是：这些重点工程的领导干部要以身作则首先克服自己脑子里的“特殊”思想。
