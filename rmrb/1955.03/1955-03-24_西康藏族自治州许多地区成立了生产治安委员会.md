    Production and Public Security Committees Established in Many Areas of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
    In seventy-two areas equivalent to townships in Kangding, Danba, and nine other counties of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Production and Public Security Committees have been established. The Production and Public Security Committee is a transitional grassroots political power organization established in accordance with the political and social conditions of the autonomous region as resolved by the Third Session of the First Representative Conference of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region in 1952. Before the official establishment of township governments, it implements the policies and decrees of the Autonomous Prefecture Representative Conference and people's committees at all levels.
    When the Production and Public Security Committees were established, representative meetings equivalent to the township level were generally convened to discuss and approve the candidates for the committee. Currently, more than 700 farmers and herdsmen activists are working in the Production and Public Security Committees.
    After the establishment of the Production and Public Security Committees, national unity and local public security have been further strengthened, wasteland reclamation and production have been promoted, and the connection between the government and the masses has been closely linked. The eight Production and Public Security Committees in Daofu County have assisted the People's Government in solving the land use rights for wasteland reclamation for 882 households of landless and land-deficient farmers, providing them with 7,500 dou of seeds over the past few years. The Production and Public Security Committees in many counties have also handled general civil cases for the masses.

    西康藏族自治州许多地区成立了生产治安委员会
    西康省藏族自治州康定、丹巴等十一县的七十二个相当于乡的地区，已经建立了生产治安委员会。生产治安委员会是一九五二年西康省藏族自治区第一届代表会议第三次会议按照自治区的政治、社会条件决议成立的一种过渡性的基层政权组织。在乡政权正式成立前，它贯彻执行自治州代表会议和各级人民委员会的政策法令。
    生产治安委员会成立时，普遍召开了相当于乡的代表会议，协商通过委员会人选。现在有七百多名农、牧民积极分子在生产治安委员会工作。
    生产治安委员会成立后，进一步加强了民族团结和地方治安，促进了开荒生产，密切了政府和群众的联系。道孚县八个生产治安委员会，几年来协助人民政府给八百八十二户无地缺地农民解决了七千五百多斗种籽的开荒土地使用权。不少县的生产治安委员会还处理了一般群众的民事案件。
