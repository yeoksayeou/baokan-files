    Subsidiary Projects of the Foziling Reservoir Actively Underway

    The subsidiary and beautification projects of the Foziling Reservoir are actively underway.

    From the completion ceremony last November to early February this year, the expansion project of the spillway has completed 9,000 *shi* of earthwork, and 10,700 cubic meters of backfilling in front of the arch. The housing project has completed more than 4,400 square meters. The memorial gate and pavilion designed by Tongji University have also been basically completed. The seismograph designed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been completed. Starting in March, a magnificent "Jingxing Pavilion" will be built on Dongshan Mountain. Workers at the reservoir have also found vivid ancient carvings at the "Great King Temple" in Longjingchong, upstream of the Shi River, below the flood storage level. They will transport these carvings to the construction site, repair and paint them, and place them in the "Jingxing Pavilion".

    Regarding the reservoir's beautification project, more than 800 herbaceous flowers and 5,000 trees and shrubs have been collected. Beautification workers have also found rare flowers and trees such as "pumice," "Rhododendron simsii," "thousand-year dwarf," and "water-absorbing stone" in the Dabie Mountains. A fountain pool has also been completed in the center of the large garden.

    In terms of the water conveyance project, the 19th pier's empty injection gate is expected to be completed by the end of May. Workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard are rushing to manufacture the switch equipment for the 17th, 18th, and 19th piers. Workers at the reservoir construction site have also recently repaired a 50-horsepower roller gate opening and closing boat.

    Recently, the reservoir construction site will adopt the Soviet Union's advanced "T-shaped" large-scale blasting method to accelerate the progress of the spillway expansion project. This advanced blasting method can blast 600 to 700 cubic meters of rock at a time, to ensure that concrete is poured in the spillway in August, and three sets of 9-meter-high, 30-ton arc gates are installed in September.

    佛子岭水库附属工程积极进行
    佛子岭水库附属工程和美化工程正积极进行。
    从去年十一月竣工大会到今年二月上旬，溢洪道扩大工程已完成九千石方，拱前还土一万零七百公方。房屋工程已完成四千四百多平方公尺。同济大学代为设计的纪念门和纪念亭也基本完成。中国科学院设计的地震台已经完成。三月起将在东山修筑一座富丽的“景行馆”。水库的工作者，并已从史河上游龙井冲在蓄洪水位以下的“大王庙”，找到了生动活泼的古代雕刻，他们将把这些雕刻运来工地，加以修补油漆后放在“景行馆”内。
    水库的美化工程方面，现已收集八百多株草本花和五千棵花木。美化工作者还在大别山区找到了“浮石”、“映山白”、“千年矮”、“上水石”等稀有的花木。并已在大花园的中心修好了喷水池。
    在输水道工程方面，十九号垛空注闸门五月底将可完成，十七、十八、十九三个垛的开关设备，江南造船厂的工人们正在赶制。水库工地的工人们，最近还修好了一只五十匹马力的滚轮闸门启闭船。
    最近，水库工地将采用苏联先进的“丁字形”大爆破法，加速溢洪道扩大工程的进展。这种先进的爆破法，一次可炸岩石六、七百公方。以保证溢洪道在八月份内浇筑混凝土，九月安装三套九公尺高、三十吨重的弧行闸门。
