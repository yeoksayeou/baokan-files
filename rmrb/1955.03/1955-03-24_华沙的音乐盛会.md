The Fifth International Chopin Piano Competition concluded in Warsaw on March 20th. The outstanding performance of the young Chinese pianist, Fu Cong, at this competition left a deep impression on the audience.

This competition lasted for nearly a month. On February 22nd, the 145th anniversary of the birth of the world-renowned Polish composer Chopin, seventy-four young pianists from twenty-four countries began their grand performances in the newly built and magnificent Warsaw People's Music Hall. Excellent musicians from various countries gathered together to engage in friendly competition, learn from each other, and exchange ideas, making it a major event in the cultural life of Poland and Europe. In February, Warsaw was still experiencing snowfall, but people braved the cold, and dense queues lined up at the ticket offices for the competition, with some spending their entire day off waiting in line to buy a ticket. Many music lovers from other European countries also traveled long distances to Warsaw.

Chopin's homeland, Poland, is a country with a long musical tradition. The International Chopin Piano Competition was initiated in 1927 by the famous Polish musician Jerzy Żurawlew and is held in Poland every five years. A total of three sessions were held until 1937. Later, Poland was occupied by Hitler's bandits, and the competition was interrupted. In 1949, the Polish People's Government sponsored the fourth competition. The participants in the first three sessions were young people aged sixteen to twenty-eight, and from the fourth session onwards, the age range was set at sixteen to thirty-two.

The Fifth Competition was held in three rounds, with eliminations after the first and second rounds, and the results determined in the third round. To ensure the fairness of the judging, the competition's judging committee was composed of more than forty famous musicians, composers, and pianists from many countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Britain, and Belgium. In the first two rounds of the competition, the judges could only give scores based on the performers' assigned numbers behind a curtain, without knowing who the performers were. In the third round, the judges assessed and scored the performers face to face. Young pianists from Poland and the Soviet Union ranked among the top in the competition.

Chinese pianists participated in the International Chopin Piano Competition for the first time. Fu Cong, a 21-year-old Chinese pianist, maintained excellent performance throughout the competition, advancing from the first round to the third round, and ultimately won third place. On March 15th, Fu Cong performed in the third round, and after Fu Cong finished playing with the accompaniment of the symphony orchestra, and the melodious piano sound gradually faded away, thunderous applause and cheers rang out, and Fu Cong came out to thank the audience three times. The French pianist, Vlado Perlemuter, also performed on the same day. His skillful technique surpassed Fu Cong's, but he did not express the rich emotions of Chopin's music as well as Fu Cong. Perlemuter ultimately won fourth place. On the 16th, the Polish "People's Tribune" published evaluations from musicians, journalists, and audience members, stating that the French pianist demonstrated skillful technique, while the Chinese pianist poetically and perfectly expressed the rich emotions in Chopin's music with a lyrical approach.

    华沙的音乐盛会
    新华社驻华沙记者　谢文清
    第五届国际萧邦钢琴比赛大会在三月二十日闭幕了。中国年青钢琴家傅聪在这次比赛中的卓越演奏，给参加大会的听众们留下了深刻的印象。
    这次比赛进行了近一个月。在世界著名的波兰作曲家萧邦一百四十五周年生日——二月二十二日，来自二十四个国家的七十四名年青钢琴家在新落成的宏伟的华沙人民音乐厅开始了他们的大会演。各国优秀的音乐家共聚一堂，进行友好的竞赛，互相观摩，交流心得，这成为波兰和欧洲文化生活中的一件大事。二月的华沙仍旧飞着雪花，但是人们不顾寒冷，大会的购票处密密层层地排着购票的队伍，有些人花了整个的休息天去排队买一张票。欧洲其他国家也有许多音乐爱好者远道赶来华沙。
    萧邦的祖国波兰是有着悠久的音乐传统的国家。国际萧邦钢琴比赛大会是由波兰著名的音乐家叶·儒拉夫列夫在一九二七年发起举办的，每五年在波兰举行一次。至一九三七年共举行了三届。后来，波兰为希特勒匪徒所侵占，比赛大会中断。到一九四九年，由波兰人民政府主办，举行了第四届比赛。前三届的参加者都是十六岁到二十八岁的青年，从第四届起规定为十六岁到三十二岁。
    第五届比赛大会是分三轮举行的，一、二两轮逐轮淘汰，到第三轮时决定比赛结果。为了保证评判的公正，大会的评判委员会是由苏联、中国、波兰、英国和比利时等许多国家的四十多位著名的音乐家、作曲家和钢琴家组成的。在前两轮比赛中，评判委员们只能隔着帷幕按演奏者的抽签编号给分，他们不知道演奏者是谁。到第三轮，评判委员们才当面看着演奏者给分。波兰和苏联的年青钢琴家在比赛中名列前茅。
    中国钢琴家是第一次参加国际萧邦钢琴比赛大会。我国二十一岁的青年钢琴家傅聪在比赛中保持着优良的成绩，从第一轮一直升到第三轮，最后获得了第三名。三月十五日，傅聪作第三轮演奏，当傅聪在交响乐队的伴奏下演奏完毕，悠扬的琴声渐渐消逝后，一阵雷般的掌声和喝采声响了起来，傅聪三次出台致谢。法国钢琴家仑金生也在同一天演奏，他的熟练的技巧超过傅聪，但在表达萧邦乐曲的丰富情感上不如傅聪。仑金生最后获得第四名。十六日，波兰“人民论坛报”上发表音乐家、记者和听众的评价说，法国钢琴家表现了纯熟的技巧，而中国钢琴家则以抒情的手法诗意地完满地表达了萧邦乐曲中的丰富情感。
