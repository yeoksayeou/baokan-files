Yunnan farmers in various regions are widely carrying out farmland water conservancy construction. The province has constructed a total of fifteen medium-sized water conservancy projects, of which those already completed can irrigate 138,550 mu of farmland; ten pumping projects can irrigate more than 33,800 mu of farmland. According to incomplete statistics from 59 counties including Chuxiong, nearly 20,000 various small-scale water conservancy projects have been built and repaired, with water storage capacity increasing compared to 1954. For example, the current water storage capacity in counties such as Mouding and Xiangyun can support transplanting 40,000 mu more rice seedlings than last year. Ethnic minority areas in border regions have also built many water conservancy projects. For example, in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, the Dai farmers in Yingjiang County alone built a canal that can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land. The fraternal ethnic groups in the Greater Snow Mountain area have also built and repaired 29 canals. (Lin Jianzhong)

    云南农民普遍兴修水利
      云南各地普遍进行农田水利兴修工作。全省共兴修中型水利工程十五处，已完成的即可灌田十三万八千五百五十亩；抽水工程十处，可灌田三万三千八百多亩。另据楚雄等五十九县不完全统计，已兴修和整修各种小型水利工程近二万处，蓄水量都比一九五四年有所增加，如牟定、祥云等县目前的蓄水量都可比去年多栽秧四万亩。边疆民族地区也兴修了许多水利工程，如德宏傣族景颇族自治区仅盈江县傣族农民修的一条水沟即可灌溉二千多亩田。大雪山区的兄弟民族也兴修与整修了二十九条水沟。（林建中）
