Developing Highway and Shipping Industries in Sichuan
　　Shu Ting

The transportation industry in Sichuan Province has greatly developed over the past five years, playing a significant role in helping various minority areas develop their economy and culture, invigorating the urban and rural economy, improving people's lives, and supporting national industrial construction.

The province of Sichuan currently has over 7,960 kilometers of highways, an increase of 950 kilometers compared to pre-liberation times. The mileage open to traffic has increased by 1,632 kilometers. At the time of liberation, more than 2,000 kilometers of the original highways were impassable due to large-scale destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. After several years of active repair, more than 1,600 kilometers that had been severely damaged and 14 highways, totaling 706 kilometers, that had never been open to traffic due to poor engineering quality have been restored. In addition, 3,900 kilometers of major trunk lines have been repaired, maintaining smooth road surfaces passable in both sunny and rainy weather. As a result, the efficiency of highway use has been improved, and the driving speed has increased from 10 kilometers per hour to an average of 25 kilometers per hour.

In recent years, the province has also systematically constructed new lines. The state's investment in highway construction has been increasing year by year. Taking 1950 as 100, it was 698.59 in 1951, 1619.29 in 1952, and 11.1 times that of 1950 in 1953 while the country was carrying out key construction projects. The planned investment for 1954 was 15 times that of 1950. In the past four years, fifteen highways, including the Cheng-A (Chengdu to Aba), Mu-Shi (Muchuan to Shijiaoying), Yi-Tang (Yibin to Tangba), Ba-Nan (Bazhong to Nanjiang), and Yu-Nan (Chongqing to Nanchong) highways, have been newly built, with 933 kilometers completed and opened to traffic. This is much more than the highways built during the ten years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang.

These highways all lead to minority areas and old revolutionary base areas. After the highways were built, they played a significant role in enlivening the economic and cultural life of minority areas. For example, after the Cheng-A highway was opened to Tibetan-populated areas in the province, local products such as medicinal materials and furs could be quickly transported to Chengdu, and the salt, oil, cloth, and grain needed by the Tibetan people could also be supplied cheaply and in a timely manner. Shua Jing Si, originally a desolate small shop, has now built楼房, and has appeared the organs, trade companies, banks, post offices, bookstores, etc., and has become a lively town. After the opening of Xuecheng Town in Li County, the price of rice per dou (a unit of dry measure) dropped from 60,000 or 70,000 yuan (old currency) to 30,000 yuan (old currency), the price of local cloth per bolt dropped from 80,000 yuan (old currency) to 60,000 yuan (old currency), and the price of pork per jin (a unit of weight) dropped from 10,000 yuan (old currency) to 4,500 yuan (old currency); in the past, one jin of peppercorns could be exchanged for four or five jin of salt, but now it can be exchanged for twelve jin. The construction of the Yu-Nan and Ba-Nan highways enables the local products of the vast areas of northern Sichuan to be quickly transported to Chongqing along the highways, and the people of Nanjiang and Bazhong can also eat cheaper salt. After the Yi-Tang highway opened to traffic, it only took one day for a car to travel the 98 kilometers between Yibin and Junlian, whereas in the past it would take several days for human or animal transport; the freight cost per ton of goods has also been reduced by 73% compared to the past human and animal power, greatly facilitating the exchange of materials between Sichuan and Yunnan. Due to improvements in transportation management, automobile transportation costs have also been greatly reduced. In the past five years, automobile freight rates have been reduced twelve times. People who could not afford to take cars in the past can now afford to do so. Grain, jute, and other materials that were rarely transported by car in the past can now be transported by car.

In terms of inland river shipping, Sichuan has 89 navigable rivers, including the Yangtze River and Jialing River, with 1,822 kilometers navigable by ships and 12,109 kilometers navigable by wooden boats, connecting more than 90 counties and cities in the province. However, before liberation, these rivers were never repaired, so most of them were not smooth. In the five years since liberation, 23 rivers have been repaired, more than 6,000 navigation marks have been set up, and 49 important dangerous shoals and reefs have been blasted, maintaining smooth navigation. After the Jialing River was renovated, the water level has been raised from 0.6 meters to 0.9 meters, and ships that could only carry 22 tons can now carry 30 tons. The Wujiang River, known as a natural barrier, used to take 30 days for a round trip of 305 kilometers from Fuling to Gongtan, but after renovation, it only takes 12 days, an efficiency increase of 60%. This has played a significant role in promoting the exchange of materials between Sichuan and Guizhou.

In the past, only the Yangtze River had ships sailing, and the hundreds of large and small rivers were navigated by ancient wooden sailing boats. In the five years since liberation, while maintaining and restoring the original waterways, two new ship routes have been opened: Chongqing to Nanchong on the Jialing River and Fuling to Gongtan on the Wujiang River, initially establishing a ship transportation industry. In addition, eight new small river transportation lines have been opened in Lueyang, Tongjiang, and Baitiao, with a total length of 683 kilometers, which can transport more than 140,000 tons of materials annually. After the opening of the Lueyang River transport, the monthly freight volume reached 70,000 tons, which played a huge role in supporting the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. In the past, the freight cost of transporting grain from Tongjiang to Pingchang was 72,000 yuan (old currency) per hundred jin, while the actual selling price of grain was only 50,000 yuan (old currency) per hundred jin, so the grain could not be transported out; and the salt urgently needed by the local people could only be exchanged for one jin with twelve jin of rice, and could not be bought. Since the Tongjiang River was renovated and opened to traffic, the freight cost per ton of rice is only 171,300 yuan (old currency), which is only one-eighth of the original cost. The people's urgent need for salt can be exchanged for four jin with twelve jin of rice, which is only one-third of the original. The rapid development of water transport has caused significant changes in people's lives.

With the increase in navigable mileage and the prosperity of the transportation industry, the lives of the vast number of boatmen and boat people have also been improving and improving. In the past, boatmen and boat people were not well-fed, not well-clothed, and lived in poverty, and had no political status. Now they have their own organization - the Boatmen's Association, and the feudal foreman system has been abolished. Many outstanding boatmen and boat people have also been elected as people's representatives. Wages have also increased from an average of 70,000 yuan (old currency) per month in 1951 to 300,000 yuan (old currency). In addition, the People's Government has also built six new boatmen's dormitory buildings in Chongqing, Luzhou, Hechuan, Fuling, and other places. Boatmen's clinics and schools for boatmen's children and literacy classes have also been set up in Hechuan and other places. At present, more than 75% of the wooden boats in the province have been organized into groups or teams and are moving towards the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. (Attached picture)

    发展中的四川公路和航运事业
    蜀亭
    四川省的交通运输事业，五年来有了很大发展，对帮助各少数民族地区发展经济和文化、活跃城乡经济、改善人民生活、支援国家工业建设都起了很大作用。
    四川全省公路现有七千九百六十余公里，较解放前增加了九百五十公里。通车里程增加了一千六百三十二公里。原有公路在解放时，因被蒋匪大肆破坏，有二千多公里不能通车。经过几年来的积极整修，已恢复了被严重破坏的一千六百多公里和原来因工程质量低劣一直没有通车的公路十四条，计七百零六公里，另外又整修了三千九百公里的主要干线，保持了路面平整，晴雨都能通车，因而提高了公路使用效能，行车速度由每小时十公里提高到每小时平均二十五公里。
    几年来，全省还有计划地建设了新线。国家用于公路建设的投资逐年增多，如以一九五○年为一百：则一九五一年为六百九十八点五十九，一九五二年为一千六百一十九点二十九；一九五三年在国家进行重点建设的同时，仍为一九五○年的十一点一倍；一九五四年计划投资数又为一九五○年的十五倍。四年来，新筑了成阿（成都到阿坝）、沐石（沐川到石角营）、宜塘（宜宾至塘坝）、巴南
  （巴中到南江）、渝南（重庆到南充）等十五条公路，已完工通车的有九百三十三公里。比国民党反动统治时期十年所修的公路多得多。
    这些公路都是通往各少数民族地区和老根据地的，公路建成后，对活跃少数民族地区的经济、文化生活起了显著的作用。如成阿公路通到省内藏族聚居的地区以后，那里出产的药材、皮毛等土产就可以很快地运到成都，藏族人民所需的盐、油、布、粮食等也可廉价及时地供应。刷经寺原是个荒凉的小店子，现已盖起了楼房，出现了机关、贸易公司、银行、邮局、书店等，变成了热闹的城镇。理县薛城镇通车后，大米每斗售价由六、七万元（旧币）降至三万元（旧币），土布每匹由八万元（旧币）降至六万元（旧币），猪肉每斤由一万元（旧币）降至四千五百元（旧币）；过去一斤花椒换四、五斤盐，现可换到十二斤。渝南、巴南公路的修筑，使川北广大地区的土产，可沿公路迅速运至重庆，南江、巴中的人民也可吃到便宜的盐巴。宜塘公路通车后，宜宾至筠连九十八公里汽车往返只需一天，要是过去人力、骡马运输一次就需要好几天；每吨货物运费也较过去人兽力降低百分之七十三，大大沟通了川滇物资的交流。由于运输经营管理的改进，汽车运输成本也降低了很多，五年来汽车运价共降低了十二次，过去坐不起汽车的人，现在也可以坐了；过去很少用汽车运的粮食、黄麻等，现在也可用汽车运了。
    在内河航运方面，四川有长江、嘉陵江等大小通航河流八十九条，轮船通航一千八百二十二公里，木船通航一万二千一百零九公里，可把全省九十余县、市联结在一起。但解放前，这些河流从来没有整修过，因此大多不能畅通。解放五年来，共整修了二十三条河流，设置航标六千多个，炸除重要险滩、暗礁四十九处，保持了航运畅通。嘉陵江整修后，水位已由零点六公尺，提高到零点九公尺，原来只能通航二十二吨的船，现可通航三十吨的。号称天险的乌江，过去涪陵至龚滩三百零五公里，往返一次需三十天，整修后只需十二天，效率提高百分之六十。这对促进川黔边物资交流，起了很大作用。
    过去全省除长江干线有轮船航行外，在成百条的大小河流中航行的都是古老的木帆船。解放五年来，在维持恢复原有航道的同时，又开辟了嘉陵江重庆至南充和乌江涪陵至龚滩两条新的轮船航线，初步建立起轮船运输事业。此外又新开辟了略阳、通江、柏条等八条小河全长六百八十三公里的运输线，每年可多运十四万吨以上的物资。略阳河运开辟后，每月货运达七万吨，对支援宝成铁路修筑，起了巨大作用。过去通江所产的粮食运到平昌，每百斤运费是七万二千元（旧币），而粮食的实际售价每百斤才五万元（旧币），因此粮食运不出去；而当地人民急需的盐巴，十二斤大米才能换
  一斤，而且买不到。自通江河整修通航后，大米每吨运费仅十七万一千三百元（旧币），仅为原来的八分之一。人民急需的盐巴，十二斤米可以换到四斤，仅为原来的三分之一。水运的迅速发展，已引起人民生活的重大变化。
    随着通航里程的增加，运输事业的繁荣，广大船工船民的生活，也日益改善和提高。过去船工船民吃不饱，穿不暖，过着困苦的生活，政治上没有地位，现在已有了船工船民自己的组织——船民协会，废除了封建把头制度。很多优秀的船工船民，也被选为人民代表。工资也由一九五一年平均每月七万元（旧币），提高到三十万元（旧币）。此外，人民政府并在重庆、泸州、合川、涪陵等地新盖了六幢船工宿舍大楼。合川等地还设立了船工诊疗所和船民子弟学校及识字班。目前，全省有百分之七十五以上的木船都已组织起来，编成组或队，正向着互助合作的道路前进。（附图片）
