Xinhua News Agency, London: British Labour Party right-wing leaders, because Bevan opposes their policy of supporting the government, intend to expel him from the Labour Party parliamentary group. It is said that the Labour Party Parliamentary Group Executive Committee has decided to expel Bevan from the parliamentary group and has decided to convene a Labour Party parliamentary group meeting on the 16th to discuss this issue.

London political figures believe that the committee's decision is an attempt to suppress the growing dissatisfaction among ordinary Labour Party members with the party's leadership's support for the British government's current policy of rearming West Germany and the atomic arms race. However, the committee's preliminary decision has aroused opposition from many Labour Party local organizations, Labour Party members, and public opinion.

As of the 12th, seven Labour Party local organizations had condemned the attempt by Labour Party right-wing leaders to expel Bevan.

Labour MP Crossman, in the "Sunday Pictorial," discussing the tricks of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders, emphasized that Bevan's attitude "embodies the wishes of grassroots party members."

The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," which takes an extremely hostile attitude towards Bevan, also acknowledged that Bevan's views reflect the sentiments of many Labour Party members. It said: "If Bevan is expelled, his opinions will not be without a spokesman."

    英工党右翼领袖打算把比万开除出议会党团
    英国工党地方组织和舆论表示抗议
    据新华社讯：伦敦消息：英国工党右翼领袖因为比万反对他们的支持政府的政策，而打算把他开除出工党议会党团。据说，工党议会党团执行委员会已经决定要把比万开除出议会党团，并且决定在十六日召开工党议会党团会议来讨论这个问题。
    伦敦政界人士认为，委员会作出这个决定，是企图压制工党普通党员对党的领导方面支持英国政府目前所采取的重新武装西德和原子军备竞争政策的日益不满。但是，委员会的这个初步决定却激起了许多工党地方组织、工党党员和舆论的反对。
    到十二日为止，已经有七个工党地方组织谴责工党右翼领袖要开除比万的企图。
    工党议员克罗斯曼在“星期日画报”谈到工党右翼领袖们的诡计时强调指出，比万的态度“体现了基层党员的愿望”。
    对比万采取极端敌视态度的“每日电讯与晨邮报”也承认比万的意见反映了工党许多党员的情绪。它说：“如果比万被开除了，他的意见也不会没有发言人的。”
