Seeds are being transferred from various places to support disaster areas in Hubei.

Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces, as well as non-disaster areas in Hubei Province, are transferring large quantities of seeds to support farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Huanggang, Xiaogan and Jingzhou prefectures in Hubei Province to resume production.

More than 35 million jin of rice seeds supported by Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces have been partially transported to various disaster-stricken counties. In Xiaogan Prefecture, 3.31 million jin of early rice seeds supported by Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces, and 13.7 million jin of grain seeds transferred from non-disaster areas within the prefecture have been transported to disaster-stricken counties such as Hanchuan, Hanyang, Jiayu, Yunmeng, Wuchang and Xianning respectively. After these seeds arrived, all localities paid attention to storage and management, and relevant departments conducted inspections. At present, farmers in various disaster areas are making full preparations for spring plowing, striving to restore production.
