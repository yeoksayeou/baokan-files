Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 18th: Since the end of February, approximately three thousand North Vietnamese residents who were deceived or forced to move to South Vietnam have returned to North Vietnam. On March 15th alone, a train from Haiphong carried over three hundred residents returning from South Vietnam to Hanoi.

Those who returned to the North expressed their gratitude for the care of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. With the government's help, they have been resettled or sent back to their hometowns. Some have continued their studies, and those engaged in business have received many conveniences from the government.

People moving to the North or traveling for business are subjected to various obstructions and even persecution by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. They cannot obtain permits even after repeated applications, or the issuance of permits is repeatedly delayed, causing them to exhaust their travel expenses and be unable to return to the North. Some are even forced to write guarantees to return to their original locations. Some who were kidnapped to the South have been detained or killed for requesting to be sent back to the North. However, despite unreasonable obstruction and threats, many people have still come to the North. They excitedly said: "Returning here is like escaping from Ngo Dinh Diem's prison."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 19th: The French Union forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are rampantly forcing people to go to South Vietnam in the Haiphong area.

To this end, the French Union forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have exhausted all kinds of means of threat and enticement, such as setting fire to some houses in villages near Haiphong, forcing those homeless farmers to board ships going to South Vietnam; distributing some military uniforms in warehouses to poor young people to wear, and then arresting these young people wearing military uniforms as "deserters." According to people from Haiphong, in the last week of February, more than 500 people were arrested in Haiphong city, and another 14 truckloads of people were taken away. The number of people coerced into "immigrant concentration camps" is even greater. A few days ago, the French Union forces surrounded the Haiphong power plant and two other places, arrested about 100 workers and citizens, and押and押them to the "immigrant concentration camp."

Under the instructions of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is ferociously searching for young people in Haiphong to go to South Vietnam to serve as soldiers. Ngo Dinh Diem clique's secret agents, police, and troops often go to public places and residences to capture young people. They also often wait at intersections to drag young people off bicycles, tear up their ID cards, and then load them onto trucks and send them away. On February 27th alone, Ngo Dinh Diem clique members seized about 250 young and middle-aged pedicab workers on the streets of Haiphong.

A atmosphere of terror is over Haiphong city. On March 6th, a sharp alarm suddenly sounded in Haiphong city. The French Union forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique forced residents to gather at designated locations immediately after hearing the "alarm." They took advantage of the people's concentration to dismantle and transport public property to avoid people's opposition. It is said that the French side and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are also preparing to use this concentration method to suddenly and massively plunder the people. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also launched a "competition campaign" among its police and special agents to force people to move south, giving rewards according to the number of people they forced to move south.

The French Union forces are also conniving with Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to force overseas Chinese to move south. On March 3rd, Ngo Dinh Diem's police searched an overseas Chinese school on Tokyo Street and arrested a group of students. Many overseas Chinese students were押to American or French ships sailing to Saigon, and even their families were not allowed to be notified. In the Hong Gai mining area, many overseas Chinese were forced to concentrate at Haikou under the threat of Chiang Kai-shek secret agents and Ngo Dinh Diem elements holding weapons.

    三千被迫南迁的北越居民突破阻挠回北越
    法方和吴庭艳集团在海防地区猖狂地劫运居民
    【新华社河内十八日电】从二月底以来，约有三千个被骗或被迫迁往南越的北越居民已经回到北越。仅在三月十五日，从海防开来的一列火车就把三百多个从南越回来的居民载到了河内。
    返抵北部的人都对越南民主共和国政府的关怀表示感激。他们在政府的帮助下，得到了安置或者被送返故乡，有的已经继续学业，经商的人也得到政府给予许多的方便。
    迁居北来或来往经商的人都受到吴庭艳集团多方阻拦甚至遭到迫害。他们经多次申请也领不到通行证，或者因被一再推延发下通行证致使他们耗尽旅费而无法北返，有的人更被强迫写下返回原地的保证书，有些被劫运到南部的人因为要求送回北部以致被扣押或被杀害。但是尽管受到无理的阻挠和威胁，许多人仍然来到了北部，他们兴奋地说：我们回到这里，就是逃出了吴庭艳的监牢。
   【新华社河内十九日电】法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团猖狂地在海防地区强迫人民到南越去。
    为了这个目的，法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团用尽了各种威胁利诱的手段，如放火烧掉海防附近乡村里的一些房屋，逼迫那些无家可归的农民登上到南越去的轮船；把仓库里的一些军装散发给贫苦的青年穿，然后把这些穿了军衣的青年作为“逃兵”抓去。据海防来人说，在二月的最后一个星期内，在海防市区内就有五百多人被捕去，另外还有十四卡车人被抓走，被胁迫到“移民集中营”去的人数目更多。前几天，法兰西联邦部队包围了海防发电厂和其它两个地方，逮捕了一百个左右的工人和市民，并且把他们押到“移民集中营”去。
    根据美国的指示，吴庭艳集团在海防穷凶极恶地搜捕青年到南越去当兵。吴庭艳集团的密探、警察和军队常到公共场所和住宅去捕捉青年，也常守候在十字路口把青年从自行车上拖下来，撕掉他们的身份证，然后把他们装上卡车送走。在二月二十七日一天内，吴庭艳集团分子就在海防各街道上抓走了二百五十个左右青壮年的三轮车工人。
    海防市区笼罩着恐怖的气氛。三月六日，海防市区忽然发出凄厉的警报声，法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团强迫居民在听到“警报”后立即到指定地点集中。他们就乘着人民集中时拆运公共财产，以躲避人民的反对。据说，法国方面和吴庭艳集团还准备用这种集中办法来猝不及防地大批地掳掠人民。吴庭艳集团还在它的警察和特务中展开了一个强迫人民南迁的“竞赛运动”，按照他们强迫南迁人民的数额给予奖赏。
    法兰西联邦部队也正在纵容蒋匪分子和吴庭艳集团强迫华侨南迁。三月三日，吴庭艳的警察搜查了在东京街上的一所华侨学校，抓走了一批学生。许多华侨学生被押上驶往西贡的美国船或法国船上去，连家属也不准通知。在鸿基矿区，有许多华侨在手持武器的蒋匪特务和吴庭艳分子的威胁下被迫到海口集中。
