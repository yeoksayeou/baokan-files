Fushun Mining Bureau overfulfilled the February production target. Fushun Coal Mine, the largest producer in the country, overfulfilled the state plan quota for February more than a day ahead of schedule, increasing coal production by nearly 30,000 tons for the country. Compared with the same period last year, the average daily output increased by 9.5 percent. Open-pit and underground mines have also overfulfilled their planned tasks.

In order to ensure the overfulfillment of the first quarter production tasks, the Fushun Mining Bureau took many important measures in February. For example, it held a safety production experience exchange meeting, strengthened material supply and spare parts ordering, further strengthened contact with the railway department, and determined a new transportation plan. On the other hand, several electric picks were added to the open-pit mine, new working faces were added to the Laohutai mine, and the advanced experience of Fuxin Ping'an Mine's one-pit one-meter layer regular cycle operation was actively promoted in the Longfeng mine, and some working faces have become regular.

In order to combine the continued implementation of comprehensive production reform, the bureau also held a workers' representative conference to improve technical measures. Due to the close combination of leadership and the masses, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. The Longfeng Mine alone has put forward more than 3,000 rationalization proposals, the most prominent of which is to increase the coal washing recovery rate. Only a small amount of equipment needs to be added to increase the recovery rate by 5 percent, which can save the country 1.5 million yuan a year and more fully guarantee the supply needed for iron and steel smelting.

    抚顺矿务局超额完成上月计划
    抚顺矿务局超额完成了二月份生产任务。全国产量最大的抚顺煤矿二月份提前一天多超额完成了国家计划产量任务，为国家增产了将近三万吨原煤。同去年同期比较，平均日产量增加了百分之九·五。露天、井工各矿，也全部超额完成了计划任务。
    抚顺矿务局为了确保第一季生产任务的超额完成，在二月份采取了不少重要措施。如召开了安全生产经验交流会，加强了材料供应及配件定货工作，进一步加强同铁道部门的联系，确定了新的运输方案。另一方面，在露天矿增加了几台电镐，在老虎台矿增加了新的工作面，在龙凤矿积极推行了阜新平安矿一坑一公尺层正规循环作业的先进经验，有的工作面业已走向正规。
    该局为了结合全面生产改革的继续贯彻，还召开了改进技术措施的职工代表大会。由于领导同群众密切结合，群众的积极性很高，仅龙凤矿就提出了三千多条合理化建议，其中突出的是对于提高洗煤回收率方面，只须增加很少的设备，就可提高回收率百分之五，不仅一年可为国家节省一百五十万元，还可更加充分地保证钢铁冶炼需要的供应。
