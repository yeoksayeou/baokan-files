Sok Condemns Western Countries for Preparing Atomic War

    Sahib Singh Sokhey, a member of the Indian Parliament, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, and author and scientist, condemned Western countries for preparing atomic war at a press reception in New Delhi on the 5th, and called on the Indian people to actively participate in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.
    Sokhey said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council has decided to use atomic weapons in large-scale wars. Recently, Dulles also said at the Bangkok Conference that the United States' Far East strategy is based on using atomic bombs as conventional "defensive" weapons. Sokhey added that although Western countries "used the word 'defensive', it is quite obvious to everyone with a smart mind that nuclear weapons can only be offensive weapons; they cannot be used for defense." He said that "this act of waving atomic weapons" by Western countries shows "the Westerners' desire to affirm their claim to colonize Asia."
    Sokhey emphasized that the Indian government and people have always firmly opposed the testing and use of atomic weapons and demanded a complete ban on such weapons. Now it is up to us to respond to this call by signing the appeal calling for a halt to the preparation for atomic war. (Xinhua News Agency)

    索克强调说，印度政府和人民一直是坚决反对试验和使用原子武器的，并且要求完全禁止这种武器。现在要由我们在要求制止准备原子战争的呼吁书上签名来响应这个号召了。　（据新华社讯）
