The planners on both sides of the Atlantic who are reviving West German militarism are doing everything they can to ensure that the Paris Accords quickly complete the final ratification procedures in order to openly rearm West Germany. To deceive public opinion and ease the opposition of people in various countries to this sinister plan, Western countries and the Adenauer group are propagating that "old-fashioned militarism" is dead in West Germany. They are also trying to disguise the fact that the future West German army will be a resurrection of Hitler's Wehrmacht under the guise of "defensive purposes" and "peaceful nature."

However, the facts cannot be concealed after all. A recently published "German Military Yearbook 1955" in West Germany makes a very frank confession about the nature and ambitions of the future West German "Defense Force." This book is a sharp mockery of those liars who try to make people believe that rearming West Germany is for the peace and security of Europe.

The "German Military Yearbook" is a handbook issued by the "German Soldiers' Association" to Nazi soldiers in West Germany to guide their thoughts and actions. This "German Soldiers' Association" is an organization of German militarists who gathered former Nazi officers in Germany after the war. According to the introduction of this "Yearbook," the association has 110,000 members and 2,500 local branches. According to the plan of the German militarists, after the West German "Defense Force" is rebuilt, the leading body of the association may become the General Staff Headquarters of the new "Defense Force," and its entire organization will form the backbone of the new "Defense Force." Therefore, the "Yearbook" it publishes is of sufficient explanatory significance.

The "German Military Yearbook 1955" confirms the fact that after the surrender of Nazi Germany, the Hitler Wehrmacht hiding in West Germany was not actually disbanded. These remnants were almost entirely organized into various disguised groups. The "Military Yearbook" lists an incomplete list of Nazi military organizations in West Germany, with their exact addresses attached. There are no less than 749 such organizations, including the Former Stormtroopers Mutual Aid Association, the Former Waffen-SS Mountain Division Association, and the Waffen-SS Third Armored Parachute Force Association. In addition, it also includes reactionary military organizations that have fled from the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe, former Nazi military groups in Austria and Saar, and so on. Obviously, these Nazi officers and soldiers, assembled according to the original Hitler Wehrmacht organization, are just waiting to put on new American-made uniforms to rebuild various Stormtroopers and Waffen-SS units.

People know that immediately after the London Nine-Power Conference passed the London Agreement to revive West German militarism last year, the so-called "Blank Department" (actually the West German "Ministry of Defense") eagerly announced that the ratification of this agreement would allow Western Europe to have a strong army with "veterans of World War II as reserves." Moreover, the senior commanders of the future West German "Defense Force" constantly revealed by West German newspapers are without exception senior officers and war criminals of Hitler's army during World War II. These include Kesselring, who served as Commander-in-Chief of Hitler's Africa Corps, Heusinger, who served as Chief of the Operations Department of Hitler's Supreme Command, Schwerin, who served as the head of the "Foreign Legion" under Hitler's "Greater General Staff," and Speidel, who served as Chief of Staff of Hitler's Ninth Army, and other important figures in Hitler's "Wehrmacht." These leaders of the future West German "Defense Force," whose hands were stained with the blood of the people of European countries during World War II, have either already entered the Adenauer government to hold important military positions, or are waiting for opportunities in Nazi military groups in West Germany. Most of them have close ties with the "German Soldiers' Association."

Now let's take a look at what kind of spirit this future "Defense Force" should have in the minds of West German militarists.

The "German Military Yearbook" uses many pages to promote the past "glory" of the Nazi Wehrmacht, and asks the future "Defense Force" soldiers not to forget the "great achievements" of their predecessors. Nazi General Field Marshal Rieb declared publicly to his younger generations in the preface of the "Yearbook": "We veterans only hope that the new army will... always be prepared for the spirit of sacrifice, just like those soldiers who took up arms and dedicated their strength in the previous two world wars."

German militarists do not just teach the younger generation to maintain the Nazi spirit in such an abstract way. They also openly announced their goals of aggression in the "Yearbook." They arrogantly said that seizing East Prussia, which is now part of the territory of Poland and the Soviet Union, is "the undeniable foundation of Germany's entire Eastern policy," "The Baltic region... will be the region where the future Federal Republic's Defense Force needs to develop its strategy..." These revanchist fantasies even developed to the point of openly clamoring to "liberate" Czechoslovakia and incorporate the Czech people into the West German "Defense Force" to carry out aggressive war tasks against the East.

This "eastward expedition" enthusiasm of the West German militarists is undoubtedly palatable to those anti-Soviet maniacs in London, Washington, and Paris who are bent on rebuilding the West German "Defense Force" as the vanguard against the Soviet Union. However, these Western anti-Soviet maniacs have forgotten a historical lesson: once German militarists have restored their military power, they will not obey anyone's command. The likes of Churchill are now trying to make the people of Western European countries forget the indescribable pain and disaster they suffered under the iron hooves of Hitler's Wehrmacht, but the West German militarists are reliving their old dream of sweeping across Western Europe. The "German Military Yearbook" takes June 13, the day when "the first missile was launched on the British Isles," as a memorial day, and also publishes photos of the Hitler Wehrmacht capturing British troops on Crete, records the scene of Waffen-SS soldiers celebrating Christmas in Belgium in 1944, and so on... At the same time, some ministers and members of the Adenauer group are also openly talking about plans to annex Alsace and Lorraine in France. Doesn't all this sufficiently illustrate that West German revanchists are eager to conquer Western Europe once again? The "German Military Yearbook" talks a lot about the task that history has given "Germany to save the Western world." It is not difficult for people to understand what the "saving" that West German militarists are talking about means.

The "German Military Yearbook 1955" makes people more clearly aware of the aggressive ambitions of West German revanchists and the real danger of the revival of German militarism. The peace-loving people of all countries must never tolerate the plan of the US-British aggressive bloc and the Adenauer group to revive the forces of West German militarism. The peace-loving people of European countries, including the people of West Germany, are stepping up their efforts to fight to prevent the final ratification and implementation of the Paris Accords. European peace-loving countries have also long declared that in the event that the Paris Accords are ratified, they will take all necessary measures to safeguard their own security and European peace. The forces of peace will never be helpless in the face of war planners. Those who are bent on reviving the forces of German militarism to attack the democratic and socialist camp will once again shoot themselves in the foot.

    这就是德国军国主义者的供状
    黄炳辉
    大西洋两岸的复活西德军国主义的策划者们正在用尽力气要使巴黎协定迅速完成最后批准手续，以便公开重新武装西德。为了欺骗舆论并缓和各国人民对这个罪恶计划的反对情绪，西方国家和阿登纳集团宣传说“老式的军国主义”在西德已经死亡了。他们并且用什么“防御目的”、“和平性质”的幌子来力图掩饰这个事实：未来的西德军队将是希特勒国防军的复活。
    但是，事实毕竟是掩盖不了的。西德最近出版的一本“一九五五年德国军人历书”，对未来的西德“国防军”的性质和它的野心作了十分坦白的自供。这本书对于那些力图使人相信重新武装西德是为了欧洲的和平和安全的骗子们，实在是尖锐的嘲弄。
    “德国军人历书”是“德国军人联合会”为西德的纳粹军人发行的一本指导他们思想和行动的手册。这个“德国军人联合会”是战后德国军国主义者聚集德国前纳粹军官的组织。根据这本“历书”的介绍，这个联合会拥有十一万会员，二千五百个地方分会。按照德国军国主义者的计划，在西德“国防军”重建起来之后，这个联合会的领导机构可能就将变成为新“国防军”的参谋总部，而它的整个组织就将构成新“国防军”的骨架。因此它所出版的“历书”，是有着足够的说明意义的。
    “一九五五年德国军人历书”证实了这样的事实：纳粹德国投降以后，藏身在西德的希特勒国防军实际上并没有解散，这些残兵败将几乎是原班地被组织在各种伪装的团体里面了。“军人历书”开列了一张西德纳粹军人组织的不完全的名单，还附有它们的确实地址，这种组织不下七百四十九个之多，其中包括像前冲锋队互助协会、前党卫军山岳师团协会、党卫军第三装甲伞兵部队协会。此外，它还包括了从东欧各人民民主国家逃亡出来的反动军人组织，在奥地利和萨尔的前纳粹军人团体等等。很显然，按照原来希特勒国防军编制结集在一起的这些纳粹官兵，只是等待着穿上美制的新军服，来把各种各样的冲锋队、党卫军的部队重建起来。
    人们知道，就在伦敦九国会议在去年通过复活西德军国主义的伦敦协议之后，西德的所谓“布兰克部”（实即西德“国防部”）就曾迫不及待地宣布，这个协定的批准将使西欧拥有一支由“二次世界大战的退伍军人作为后备”的强大的陆军。而且，西德报纸所不断透露的未来的西德“国防军”的高级指挥官，毫无例外地都是第二次世界大战中希特勒军队的高级军官和战争罪犯。其中包括曾担任希特勒的非洲兵团总司令的克律维尔、曾任希特勒最高统帅部作战部部长的许辛格、曾任希特勒的“大参谋本部”所属“外籍军团”首脑的施威林，以及曾任希特勒第九军团参谋长的斯派达尔和其他希特勒“国防军”中的重要人物。这些在二次大战中双手沾满了欧洲各国人民血迹的、未来西德“国防军”的领导者，或者早已进入阿登纳政府中担任军事要职，或者是在西德的纳粹军事团体中等待时机。他们大部分都和“德国军人联合会”有着密切的联系。
    现在再来看看，在西德军国主义者的心目中，这支未来的“国防军”要具备一种什么样的精神。
  “德国军人历书”用了许多的篇幅来宣扬纳粹国防军过去的“光荣”，要未来的“国防军”军人不要忘记他们的先辈的“丰功伟绩”。纳粹将领黎伯元帅在“历书”的序言中公开向他的后辈们说：“我们老兵只有希望新的军队将……时刻准备好牺牲的精神，正如那些在上两次大战中拿起武器和献出了他们的力量的士兵一样。”
    德国的军国主义者并不只是这样抽象地教导年青的一代保持纳粹精神，他们在“历书”中还公开宣布他们的侵略目标。他们狂妄地说：夺取现在属于波兰和苏联领土一部分的东普鲁士，乃是“德国的整个东方政策的不容否认的基础”，“波罗的海地区……将是未来的联邦共和国国防军需要发展韬略的地区……”这些复仇主义者的狂想甚至发展到这样的程度，公然喧嚷要“解放”捷克斯洛伐克，把捷克人民编进西德的“国防军”，来执行对东方的侵略战争任务。
    西德军国主义者这种“东征”的热诚，无疑对于在伦敦、华盛顿和巴黎的那些一心想要重建西德“国防军”作为反对苏联的先锋队的反苏狂者，是对胃口的。但是，这些西方的反苏狂者忘记了
  一个历史的教训：当德国军国主义者一旦恢复了他们的军事力量，他们是不会听从别人的指挥的。邱吉尔之流现在力图使西欧各国人民忘记他们在希特勒国防军铁蹄下遭受过的难以形容的痛苦和灾难，但是西德的军国主义者却在重温着他们往日横扫西欧的旧梦。“德国军人历书”就把“第一颗飞弹投在英伦”的六月十三日作为纪念日，并且还登载着希特勒国防军在克里特岛上俘掳英国军队的照片，记载了党卫军士兵一九四四年在比利时欢度圣诞节的情景等等……。同时，阿登纳集团的一些部长和议员也在公开谈论着吞并法国的亚尔萨斯和洛林的计划。这一切难道不就足以说明西德复仇主义者是渴望着再一次征服西欧吗？“德国军人历书”大谈历史赋予“德国拯救西方世界”的任务，人们不难明白，西德军国主义者所说的“拯救”是意味着什么。
    “一九五五年德国军人历书”使人们更清楚地认识到西德复仇主义者的侵略野心，和复活德国军国主义的真正危险。各国爱好和平的人民是绝不能容忍美英侵略集团和阿登纳集团所策划的复活西德军国主义势力的计划的。欧洲各国爱好和平的人民，包括西德人民在内，正在再接再厉地为阻止最后批准和实施巴黎协定而斗争。欧洲爱好和平的国家也早已宣布，在巴黎协定一旦批准的情况下，它们将采取保障自己的安全和欧洲和平的一切必要措施。和平力量在战争策划者面前绝不会束手无策。那些一心想复活德国军国主义势力来进攻民主和社会主义阵营的人将会是再一次搬石头打自己的脚。
