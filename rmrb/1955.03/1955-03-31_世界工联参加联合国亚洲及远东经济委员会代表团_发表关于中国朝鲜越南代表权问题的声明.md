Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th: The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) to the 11th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) issued a statement on the issue of representation for China, Korea, and Vietnam. This statement has been distributed by the conference secretariat. The statement is as follows:

The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing the broad masses of workers and trade union organizations worldwide, fully supports the statement of the Soviet delegation on the issue of representation for China, Korea, and Vietnam. It believes that this Commission should seriously consider this statement, which reflects the legitimate demands of the people of these countries.

The People's Republic of China is a major Asian nation with a population of 600 million. Its efforts in maintaining world peace and its achievements in economic construction have greatly enhanced its international prestige. It has developed trade and economic ties with many countries in the region. Facts have proven that such ties have played a positive role in the friendly cooperation and normal economic development of countries in the ECAFE region. As China's national economy has been rapidly and continuously developing in recent years, these ties will further expand and play an even greater role.

It is well known that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the Chinese people. However, its legitimate status in this Commission has been consistently denied, which is abnormal and unreasonable. In order to smoothly carry out the work of this Commission and accomplish its assigned tasks, and to satisfy the common aspirations of peace-loving countries in Asia, it is imperative to immediately end this situation, admit the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China, which enjoys the unanimous support of the entire Chinese people, to participate in the work of this Commission, and expel the so-called "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who have long been spurned by the Chinese people, from this Commission. This will greatly help to ease international tensions and expand economic cooperation among countries in the region.

This Commission should also admit representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in the work of this Commission.

    世界工联参加联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会代表团
    发表关于中国朝鲜越南代表权问题的声明
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：参加联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会第十一届会议的世界工会联合会代表团发表关于中国、朝鲜和越南代表权问题的声明，这一声明已经由会议秘书处散发。声明如下：
    世界工会联合会代表团代表全世界广大工人群众和工会组织，完全支持苏联代表团关于中国、朝鲜和越南代表权问题的声明，并认为本委员会应认真考虑这一反映这些国家人民的合法要求的声明。
    中华人民共和国是拥有六亿人口的亚洲大国。它在维护世界和平方面的努力和经济建设方面的成就，已经大大提高了它的国际威望。它同本地区许多国家都发展了贸易和经济上的联系，事实证明，这种联系对于联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家的友好合作和正常经济发展已经起了良好的作用。由于中国的国民经济几年来一直在迅速地、不断地发展，这种联系还会更加扩大，还会发生更大的作用。
    众所周知，中华人民共和国政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府。但是它在本委员会中的合法地位却一直被剥夺，这种情况是不正常、不合理的。为了顺利进行本委员会的工作，完成它所担负的任务，为了满足亚洲爱好和平国家的共同愿望，必须立即结束这种情况，接纳获得全中国人民一致拥护的中华人民共和国政府的代表参加本委员会的工作，并且把早已为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团的所谓“代表”从本委员会驱逐出去。这对于缓和国际紧张局势和扩大本地区国家的经济合作都将有极大的帮助。
    本委员会还应当接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的代表参加本委员会的工作。
