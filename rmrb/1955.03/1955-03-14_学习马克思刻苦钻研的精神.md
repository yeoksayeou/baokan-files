    Learning from Marx's Spirit of Diligent Study
    Li Zhiyuan
    Today is the 72nd anniversary of the death of the great Karl Marx, the mentor of the world's proletarian revolution. Marx not only created the theory of scientific communism through lifelong unremitting struggle, illuminating the path to human liberation, but also set a noble example for all communists and revolutionaries in his scientific research and practice methods.
    Marx's learning was both broad and profound. He not only had amazing achievements in social sciences such as economics, philosophy, history, and law, but also had great accomplishments in natural sciences, mathematics, literature, and linguistics. According to Lafargue's recollection, Marx could give satisfactory and detailed answers to any imaginable topic, and his answers always contained general philosophical insights. Marx was able to achieve this because of his scientific attitude and methods in study and research.
    Marx's most basic learning method was to link theory with practice. His greatest achievement was his ability to combine the qualities of a great thinker and a revolutionary practitioner.
    The bookwormish habit of blindly clinging to books and the empiricist style of ignoring the significance of scientific theory are both incompatible with Marx's scientific attitude. Marx advocated that when engaging in scientific research, one should delve deeply into science itself. Knowledgeable people who do not want to lag behind must constantly participate in social undertakings and should not be satisfied with confining themselves to their studies or laboratories.
    Marx mercilessly criticized the philosophers of the time who mechanically applied other people's formulas. This can be clearly seen in his "The Poverty of Philosophy" and "Collected Letters." When studying problems, he always started from reality, not from books and formulas. Engels said that he always obtained the most desired practical evidence from the latest historical events to prove his theories. Marx also said that those engaged in scientific research should first use their knowledge to serve humanity.
    Because Marx held such a correct attitude towards scientific theory, he devoted the rich knowledge he gained from his difficult scientific research to the cause of human liberation. Marx's life was a life of struggle and a life of learning.
    Marx maintained a modest, honest, and pragmatic attitude in his studies. For example, when he was the editor of the "Rheinische Zeitung" from 1842 to 1843, he encountered some unfamiliar economic issues, such as land ownership, peasant issues, free trade, and protective tariffs. He frankly admitted that his knowledge of these issues was limited. At that time, the "Rheinische Zeitung" and the Augsburg "Allgemeine Zeitung" were also arguing about French socialist ideas, which Marx was not very familiar with either. He said, "I frankly admit that my knowledge at the time did not allow me to dare to make any judgment on the content of the French school itself." So, after leaving the "Rheinische Zeitung" in 1843, he quickly began to study political economy, French socialist thought, and French history. The result of this research led him to turn to socialism. It was because Marx did not pretend to know what he did not know, and actively strived to turn "ignorance" into "knowledge," that he was able to attain true knowledge and become the greatest thinker and revolutionary.
    Marx was never complacent and always maintained a serious and meticulous attitude in his studies. For example, when studying, he always took careful reading notes and critical summaries. He did not simply finish reading and writing the books and notes he had already read and written, but constantly reviewed them in order to become familiar with and apply them. He had a strong memory, but never relied solely on memory. When citing materials, he always cited verifiable evidence and never used any untested materials, nor did he cite indirect sources; he always found the original source. Even for minor data, he had to find the basis, for which he even spared no effort to go to the British Museum Library to search. In order to be able to read original works, he learned the languages of all major European countries and was able to write correctly in German, French, and English. He also learned Russian at the age of fifty, which greatly facilitated his scientific research.
    Marx's spirit of diligent study is most prominently manifested in his writing of "Das Kapital." He spent forty years writing this book, and the intensity of his effort was truly consistent throughout those forty years. In order to write this book, he had studied over one thousand five hundred books and made summaries of them. He did not let go of any subject related to this issue. The section on the British Factory Act in "Das Kapital" only occupies more than twenty pages, but in order to write about this issue, he consulted all the reports of special investigation teams made by factory inspectors from various places in the British Museum.
    Marx always repeatedly reviewed and revised his works, thinking deeply and striving for perfection. For example, the first draft of his "Das Kapital" was completed from 1861 to 1863, but its first volume was not published until 1867, and the second volume was still being revised by Marx until his death in 1883. The front part of the original manuscript of the second volume alone has eight versions that have been preserved. During the long years of writing "Das Kapital," some friends advised him to write and publish a part of it first, so that he could get some royalties to solve his financial difficulties; but Marx resolutely refused to accept this suggestion. As Lafargue said, Marx would never publish a work until he had repeatedly revised it to achieve satisfaction in form. Marx's attitude came from a high sense of responsibility to the people. Marx believed that if what we contribute to the workers is not perfect, it would be a sin.
    Marx always implemented the spirit of analysis, criticism, and creation when engaging in scientific research, and he never equivocated. In his theoretical research, he would certainly collect a large amount of material, but it was certainly not for the purpose of simply listing materials, let alone to boast of his erudition with abundant materials, but rather to analyze and criticize them from a proletarian standpoint and with a materialist viewpoint and method. He said: "Research must gather rich material, analyze its different forms of development, and explore the internal connections of these various forms. Without first completing this work, one cannot have an appropriate explanation of the real movement." ("Das Kapital," Volume I, "Postface to the Second Edition") Because of this, Marx was able to create scientific proletarian philosophy—dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, and socialism—in his study of classical philosophy, classical economics, and utopian socialist doctrines. His reading notes and his main works are all imbued with criticality and combativeness. For example, he criticized the "Critical Philosophy" of the Bauer brothers in "The Holy Family," criticized various German philosophical ideas in "The German Ideology," criticized Proudhon's ideas in "The Poverty of Philosophy," and criticized bourgeois economics in "Critique of Political Economy" and "Das Kapital." This is exactly as Lenin said, he examined everything that human society has created with a critical attitude and did not neglect anything.
    Marx never let go of criticism of the shortcomings of other people's works, but he also never glossed over the achievements of others. For example, in "Das Kapital," he quoted many original texts from unknown writers. He believed that no matter how unknown a writer was, as long as he was the first to express an opinion or had expressed a more correct opinion than anyone else, he should not be despised or glossed over. Marx's critical spirit in learning was not criticism for the sake of criticism, but in order to find the truth and adhere to the truth. He treated the works of others in this way, and he also treated his own works in this way. He often engaged in strict self-criticism. No matter how much effort he had put into his own works, once he discovered defects and errors, he would not hesitate to delete them. He treated the criticisms of others towards him in the same way. He welcomed the opinions of both "big figures" and "small figures"; he never worshipped authority but never yielded to those baseless malicious slanders. He said: "Every judgment based on scientific criticism is welcome to me. As for prejudices based on so-called public opinion, which I never yield to, the Florentine poet's maxim is still as applicable to me as before: 'Go your way, and let people talk.'" ("Das Kapital," Volume I, "Preface to the First Edition")
    Marx's learning method was built on a solid foundation of diligent study and fearlessness of difficulty. Marx had a famous saying: "There is no easy road in science, and only those who do not fear hard work in climbing the rugged path can hope to reach the brilliant summit." ("Das Kapital," Volume I, "Preface and Postface to the French Translation")
    Marx's learning and research were so extensive and in-depth that he had to re-explore all the achievements of human thought before him, accept them critically, and test them one by one based on the practice of the workers' movement. On this basis, he created the great Marxist doctrine.
    In his scientific research, Marx not only encountered the difficulties of scientific research itself, but also encountered various economic difficulties. Being "penniless" was common for him. In October 1851, in order to write "Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne," he even pawned his clothes to buy manuscript paper. When Marx's "Critique of Political Economy" was completed in 1859, he did not even have the money to buy stamps to send it to Berlin for publication. In economic terms, if it were not for the generous help of his closest comrade-in-arms, Engels, he would have had even more difficulties. But Marx never bowed to these difficulties and continued to persist in scientific research and revolutionary work as usual.
    Marx had to engage in scientific research and theoretical writing on the one hand, and personally guide the revolutionary movement of the international proletariat on the other, so the heaviness of the work and the urgency of time can be imagined. But no difficulty could stop Marx from persisting in work and study. He would even forget to eat and sleep when he worked. According to Lafargue's recollection, although Marx never slept late, he always got up between eight and nine in the morning, drank a cup of black coffee, looked at the newspaper, and then went into his studio. There he worked until two or three in the morning the next day. He had developed the habit of working all night since he was a teenager. Work had become an addiction for Marx, and such a fascinating addiction that it often made him forget to eat. At mealtime, he often had to be urged repeatedly before he came to the dining room; he had not even swallowed the last bite of food before he went back to his study. Liebknecht also recalled Marx saying that Marx even carried a notebook with him when he went for a walk, and would take it out and look at it at any time.
    In today's vigorous development of socialist construction in the motherland, many of our comrades are studying Marxist theory and striving to do every job in socialist construction well. But from the current situation, there are still many people who have not established a correct attitude towards learning and lack a spirit of diligent study. For example, some people use the excuse of "being too busy" and "not having time" to not actively study theory. Some people put the study of theory in opposition to business, saying that "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst," ignoring the guiding significance of theory for practical work. Some people are afraid of hardship in learning and want to take shortcuts. Although they have a certain ability for self-study, they are unwilling to study hard and want to solve problems by listening to reports. Some people also "do not seek thorough understanding" when reading, do not like to put in hard work, and try to find ready-made answers, otherwise they feel unable to delve deeper. There are also many people who do not pay attention to linking theory with practice in their studies, and specialize in memorizing formulas and "blindly clinging to books," resulting in very poor learning results. If these comrades do not properly correct their learning attitudes and improve their learning methods, they will never be able to learn theory well. Therefore, we must follow the great example of Marx and learn Marxism-Leninism with a correct attitude and method.

    学习马克思刻苦钻研的精神
    李致远
    今天是全世界无产阶级革命的导师——伟大的卡尔·马克思逝世七十二周年的日子。马克思不但以终生不懈的斗争，创造了科学共产主义学说，照亮了人类解放的道路；同时，他在科学研究和实践的方法上，也为一切共产党员和革命者树立了崇高的榜样。
    马克思的学习是既广博而又精深的。他不但在经济学、哲学、历史、法律等社会科学上有惊人的成就，而且在自然科学、数学、文学和语言学方面也都很有修养。据拉法格的回忆，对于任何可以想像出来的题目，马克思都能给予满意的详尽的回答，而且在回答时总是有概括性的哲学的见解。马克思之所以能够做到这样，是跟他在学习钻研中的科学态度和方法分不开的。
    马克思最基本的学习方法，就是理论联系实际。他的最伟大的地方，就是他能够把伟大思想家和革命实践家这两种性质结合在一起。
    死啃书本的书呆子习气以及忽视科学理论意义的经验主义作风，都是同马克思的科学态度格格不入的。马克思主张从事科学研究的时候要深入钻研科学本身。有学问的人如果不愿落后，就必须不断地参加社会事业，不要把自己关在书斋或实验室里就心满意足。
    马克思对于当时那些死套别人公式的哲学家作了无情的批判。这从他的“哲学底贫困”和“书信集”中可以清楚地看出来。他自己在研究问题时，总是从实际出发，而不是从书本和公式出发。恩格斯说过，他总是由最新的历史上的事情，……取得他最希望的现实的证据，来证明他的理论。马克思还说过，从事科学研究的人们，应该首先拿他们的学识为人类服务。
    正因为马克思对于科学理论抱着这样正确的态度，所以他在从事各种科学的艰深的研究中，把研究所得到的丰富知识贡献给人类的解放事业。马克思的一生，是战斗的一生，也是学习的一生。
    马克思在学习中，是抱着虚心老实的实事求是的态度。譬如在一八四二年至一八四三年，他担任
  “莱茵报”编辑时，碰到了一些经济学上的生疏的问题，如土地所有权问题、农民问题、自由贸易和保护关税等问题，他就坦率地承认自己对这些问题的知识有限。当时“莱茵报”和奥格斯堡“普通日报”又在争论法国的社会主义思想问题，这在马克思也不是很熟悉的。他说：“坦白承认，我当时的知识不容许我对于法国流派的内容本身敢加任何判断。”于是在一八四三年脱离“莱茵报”后，他就赶快研究起政治经济学、法国社会主义思想和法国历史来了。这种研究的结果，使他转向社会主义。正因为马克思不强不知以为知，并积极努力由“不知”变成“知”，所以他才能得到真知，才能成为最伟大的思想家和革命家。
    马克思从来没有自满过，总是抱着认真钻研的态度，丝毫也不马虎。如他在学习时，总是细心地作读书笔记，作批判的摘要。对于已经读过的书和写过的笔记，他也不是光读过写过就算完事，而是不断地翻阅，以便熟悉和运用。他的记忆力很强，但决不单凭记忆办事。他在引用材料时，一定要引用证据确凿的，从不利用任何未经检验过的材料，决不引用间接的根据，总要找到它原来的出处。那怕次要的资料，他也要查出根据，为此，他甚至不惜精力，专门到英国博物院图书馆去查找。为了能读原著，他学会了欧洲一切主要国家的语言，并且能正确地用德、法、英三国文字写作。他在五十岁时，还学会了俄文。这就大大地便利了他从事科学的研究。
    马克思认真钻研的精神，最突出地表现在他对
  “资本论”的写作上。他写这部书，整整用了四十年的工夫，其紧张的程度，真是四十年如一日。为了写这部书，他曾经钻研过一千五百种书，而且都作了提要。凡是和这一问题有关的科目，他都没有放松过。“资本论”中关于英国工厂法问题仅仅占了二十多页，可是他为了写这个问题竟把英国博物院里各地工厂视察员所作的特殊调查团的报告都参考遍了。
    马克思对于自己的作品，总是反复审阅，反复修改，深思熟虑，精益求精。比如，他的“资本论”初稿是一八六一年到一八六三年完成的，但它的第一卷直到一八六七年才出版，第二卷直到一八八三年马克思临终以前，还仍在整理修改中。仅第二卷前面的一部分原稿，现在保存下来的就有八种之多。在“资本论”的长年写作中，有些朋友劝他先写一部分出版，也好得些稿费解决生活困难；但马克思坚决不接受这个意见。正如拉法格所说的，在马克思未把一种作品一再修改得在形式上也获得满意以前，他决不愿拿它去出版。马克思的这种态度是来自对人民的高度责任感。马克思认为，如果我们贡献给劳动者的东西有一点不够尽善尽美的话，那就要算是一种罪恶。
    马克思在从事科学研究时总是贯彻分析、批判和创造的精神，决不含糊。他在研究理论中，一定要搜集大量的材料，但决不是为了单纯罗列材料，更不是以材料丰富来夸耀自己知识渊博，而是为了要以无产阶级立场和唯物主义观点、方法加以分析批判。他说：“研究必须搜集丰富的材料，分析它的不同的发展形态，并探寻出这各种形态的内部联系。不先完成这种工作，便不能对于现实的运动，有适当的说明。”（“资本论”第一卷“第二版跋”）正因为这样，马克思才能在古典哲学、古典经济学和空想社会主义学说的研究中，创造出科学的无产阶级的哲学——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、政治经济学和社会主义。他的读书笔记，他的主要著作，无不带有批判性和战斗性。如在“神圣的家族”中批判了鲍尔兄弟底“批判哲学”，在“德意志意识形态”中批判了德国各种哲学思想，在“哲学底贫困”中批判了普鲁东的思想，在“政治经济学批判”和“资本论”中批判了资产阶级的经济学。这诚如列宁所说的，凡人类社会所创造出的一切，他都用批判态度来审查过，任何事物也没有忽略过去。
    马克思对别人的著作的缺点决不放过批评，但对于别人的功绩也决不抹煞。如在“资本论”中他引证了很多的无名作家的原文。他认为无论是怎样一个无名的作家，只要是他第一个发表了一种意见，或是曾经发表过比任何人更正确的意见，就不应轻视或抹煞。马克思在学习中的批判精神，不是为批判而批判，而是为了找出真理和坚持真理。他对别人的著作如此，对自己的著作也是如此。他经常作严格的自我批评。他自己的作品，不论花了多大心血，一旦发现了缺陷和错误，就毫不犹豫地把它删掉。他对别人对他的批评也是如此。不论“大人物”“小人物”的意见，他都不胜欢迎；他决不崇拜权威，而对那些无根据的恶意诽谤也绝不让步。他说：“每一种以科学批判为根据的判断，都是我欢迎的。关于以所谓舆论为根据而我从来不对它让步的偏见，佛洛伦大诗人的格言，现在还和以前一样对于我是适用的。‘走你的路，让人家去说话。’”
  （“资本论”第一卷“初版序”）
    马克思的学习方法是建筑在刻苦钻研和不怕困难的牢固基础上的。马克思有一句名言：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”
  （“资本论”第一卷“法文译本之序与跋”）
    马克思的学习和研究是那样的广泛和深入，凡在他以前人类思想所建树的一切成果，他都要重新探讨，批判地接受，并根据工人运动的实践来一一加以检验，在这样的基础上，创造出伟大的马克思主义学说。
    马克思在科学研究中，不仅遇到了科学研究本身的困难，而且也遇到了经济上的种种困难。穷到
  “一文不名”，是他常有的事。一八五一年十月他为了写作“科仑共产党人诉讼真相记”，竟拿上衣服当了买稿纸。一八五九年马克思的“政治经济学批判”完成时，竟没有钱买邮票把它寄往柏林出版。在经济方面若不是有他最亲密的战友恩格斯的慷慨帮助，那他就会更加困难。但是马克思决不向这些困难低头，照常地坚持科学研究和革命工作。
    马克思一面要从事科学研究和理论著作，一面还要亲自指导国际无产阶级的革命运动，因此，工作的繁重，时间的紧迫，是可想而知的。但无论什么困难也没有阻挡住马克思坚持工作和学习。他工作起来甚至会废寝忘食。据拉法格回忆说，马克思虽然从来睡得很晚，但他总在早晨八九点钟之间起床，喝完一杯黑咖啡，看一下报纸，便走进他的工作室。在那儿他一直工作到第二天早晨两三点钟。他从少年时代就养成彻夜工作的习惯。工作对于马克思已成为一种嗜好，而且是如此迷人的嗜好，时常使他因工作而忘食。吃饭时，时常要人一再催请，他才到餐室中来；他还没有咽下最后一口饭，便又走向他的书室去了。李卜克内西回忆马克思时也说，马克思甚至在散步时，也带着笔记本子，随时拿起来翻看。
    在祖国社会主义建设蓬勃进展的今天，我们许多同志都在学习马克思主义理论，努力做好社会主义建设中的每一项工作。但从当前的情况来看，还有不少人没有树立起正确的学习态度，缺乏钻研精神。比如有人借口“工作太忙”“没有时间”，就不积极学习理论。有人把学习理论跟业务对立起来，说什么“远水不解近渴”，忽视理论对实际工作的指导意义。有人在学习中怕艰苦，想走捷径，虽具备一定的自修能力，也不肯用心读书，想靠听报告解决问题。也有人读书“不求甚解”，不爱下苦工夫，企图找现成的答案，不然就觉得钻不下去。也还有不少的人在学习中不注意联系实际，专门熟记公式，“死啃书本”，因而学习效果很差。这些同志如不好好端正学习态度和改进学习方法，绝不能学好理论。因此，我们必须遵照马克思的伟大榜样，以正确的态度和方法来学习马克思列宁主义。
