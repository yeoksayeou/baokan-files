　　In recent years, with the growing need for timber for national economic construction, timber transportation construction in my country's forestry infrastructure has seen tremendous development.

　　At present, more than thirty forest railways have been built, stretching over two thousand four hundred kilometers. These railways extend across mountains and dense forests, transporting timber from mountain log yards to final storage yards. In addition, one thousand kilometers of highways and forest roads, and more than one hundred kilometers of dedicated railway lines have been built, allowing large quantities of timber and logs to be transported smoothly to factories, mines, and various infrastructure construction sites.

　　Dozens of rivers have been dredged, enabling timber production to fully utilize natural conditions for water transportation and water-based timber collection. Among them, the famous Guangxi Wupai River and Hunan Santan Shierlang projects were dredged and blasted. Before the blasting of reefs in Santan Shierlang, where the water was rapid and there were many shoals, it took eight workers to transport every 20 cubic meters of rafts along the 15-li waterway, costing 140,000 old yuan. After the waterway was cleared, each raft only required four people, costing 40,000 old yuan. If the annual water transport volume is 5 million cubic meters, the country will save 25 billion old yuan and one million raft workers annually.

　　In addition, a flatcar line of one thousand kilometers long has been laid, densely distributed between the forest area, the storage yard and the timber processing plant, to ensure the transportation of coarse wood from the mountain edge, out of the river, to the storage yard and to the timber processing plant.

    年来森林铁路和林区河运建设有显著发展
    随着国民经济建设对木材日益增长的需要，几年来我国林业基本建设中的木材运输建设有了巨大的发展。
    目前共已修建了三十余条森林铁路，长达二千四百余公里。这些铁路纵横延伸在群山密林中，将木材从山上楞场源源运集在最终贮木场。另外，还修建了一千公里的公路，林道，一百余公里的铁路专用线，使大批成材、原木畅通无阻地运到了工厂、矿山和各个基本建设工地。
    疏浚了数十条河流，使得木材生产可以充分利用自然条件，进行水上运材，水上集材。其中疏炸了著名的广西五排河和湖南三滩十二浪工程。原三滩十二浪滩多水急，在炸礁前仅十五里水程，每运二十立方公尺的木排就需工人八名，运费旧币十四万元，炸礁后水道畅通每排只需四人，运费旧币四万元，假如水上运材年运量以五百万立方公尺的话，一年将为国家节约旧币二百五十亿资金，一百万名排工。
    此外，还铺设了长达一千公里的平车线路，密布在林区与贮木场和制材加工厂之间，保证了粗大的木材从山楞、出河、归楞、装车到贮木场与制材加工厂之间的运送。               （梅凤祥）
