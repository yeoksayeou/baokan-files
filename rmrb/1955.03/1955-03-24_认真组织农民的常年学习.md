    Seriously Organize Farmers' Regular Study

    Currently, as winter studies in various regions are gradually transitioning into regular study, Party committees and governments at all levels should seize the opportunity, strengthen guidance on this work, to ensure the healthy progress of regular study for the broad masses of farmers.

    The task of farmers' spare-time cultural education is arduous. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, we must strive to basically eliminate illiteracy among township-level cadres nationwide; in areas with earlier development and a solid foundation for agricultural production cooperatives, eliminate illiteracy among the majority of existing agricultural cooperative members and activists, and a small number of young and middle-aged illiterates who are not cooperative members; and in other areas, strive to enroll a portion of agricultural cooperative members, mutual aid team members, activists, and other young and middle-aged illiterates, and eliminate illiteracy among a portion of them. The realization of this task will play a positive role in promoting the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas. In order to accomplish this task, we must not only strive to run winter schools well, but also continue to organize farmers for regular study, so-called year-round learning, after the end of winter schools.

    The experience of the past few years has proven that in places where farmers are organized for regular study, the learning results of winter schools can be consolidated and improved; conversely, the phenomenon of "attending winter school every year, starting from scratch every year" will occur. This not only wastes manpower and resources but also seriously affects the task of systematically eliminating illiteracy among farmers and improving their political and cultural levels. Therefore, organizing farmers' regular study after the end of winter schools has become the main task in farmers' spare-time cultural education.

    Winter school learning is the foundation for farmers' regular study. It is necessary to carefully examine and summarize the winter school work of 1954, clarify the situation, identify problems, and obtain experience and lessons, as the basis for organizing this year's regular study. First of all, it is necessary to focus on checking the implementation of the policy on farmers' spare-time cultural education. The winter schools of 1954 basically implemented the policy on farmers' spare-time cultural education; however, there were also many problems, the main one being that many places did not understand and implement the policy sufficiently. For example, some people simply understood the policy stipulated by the First National Farmers' Spare-time Cultural Education Conference as only running schools in agricultural cooperatives. Some places did not pay enough attention to organizing village cadres and activists to study. Some places even adopted a passive attitude toward this work because they did not understand the relationship between improving the cultural level of farmers and realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. These shortcomings should be corrected in the work of organizing regular study. Secondly, it is necessary to systematically summarize the experience in running schools in agricultural cooperatives, organizing village cadres and activists to study, and the organizational leadership of winter schools, to guide future work. In addition, an achievement assessment should be conducted for winter school students, and graduation exams should be held for students who have reached the graduation level of eliminating illiteracy, so that they know their actual achievements, to enhance their learning confidence and encourage them to continue participating in regular study.

    Years of practice in farmers' spare-time cultural education have proven a law, which is: farmers' learning must be adapted to local conditions, and their learning progress and study load should be adapted to the degree of busy and idle farming seasons. Adjust the teaching progress and increase or decrease the study load according to the degree of busy and idle farming seasons. Regular study is carried out during the production season. The key to whether it can be sustained lies in whether the contradiction between study and production can be resolved. In the past, there were two biases in some places in dealing with this issue: one was that they did not see the favorable conditions for regular study, opposed production and study, and adopted a laissez-faire attitude; the other was that they did not study the characteristics of the agricultural production season and the living conditions of the masses, overemphasized formalized class teaching, so that study and production conflicted, and many farmers were unable to participate in study, and those who had enrolled could not persevere. Both of these biases should be overcome in this year's work.

    It should be affirmed that in general, farmers can study between spring plowing and autumn harvest. In particular, farmers who have already been organized are more likely to persist in regular study because their production time is more consistent. The experience of the past few years has proven that to solve the contradiction between study and production, we must first be good at determining the learning progress according to the degree of busy and idle farming seasons. When farming is not too busy, a certain progress can be maintained, and some new lessons can be taught; when farming is busy, the teaching progress should be slowed down, and the amount of teaching should be reduced; when farming is the most tense, there should be a holiday, and classes should be resumed in time after the busy period. Secondly, due to the different situations of the students, the learning organization and progress can also vary from person to person. Those who can study in a concentrated manner should study in a concentrated manner, and those who cannot study in a concentrated manner should study in a decentralized manner. For example, agricultural cooperative members and young people with less production activity and lighter living burdens are more likely to study in a concentrated manner, and their learning organization can be more concentrated; in addition, some people cannot study in a concentrated manner, and their learning organization can be more dispersed. For those who have more study time, the teaching progress can be appropriately faster; conversely, it should be slower. In order to ensure the study of the masses, especially village cadres and activists, it is necessary to rationally arrange the time for various rural meetings and the scoring and work calculation time of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and leave them some study time. This is not only necessary but also possible. In order to better solve the contradiction between study and production, it is also necessary to give full play to the learning enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. As long as their enthusiasm is brought into play, they will take feasible measures according to their own situations, overcome all difficulties, squeeze out time, and ensure the normal progress of regular study.

    The requirements for farmers' regular study should also vary depending on the object. In addition to requiring them to actively consolidate the learning results of winter schools, those with better learning conditions and foundation can also study new lessons appropriately; those with poorer conditions can be required to do less, but also take all feasible and effective measures to enable them to learn something, at least to give them time to review old lessons and avoid relapse. For students who have already emerged from illiteracy, special attention should be paid to consolidating and improving their cultural level, and high school classes (groups) should be opened for them according to possible conditions. Village cadres and activists should also be required to actively participate in study to improve their political and cultural level and drive the general farmers to study. In regular study, in addition to cultural study, political study should still be conducted in conjunction with the central tasks of rural areas in various periods. At present, it is necessary to focus on conducting current affairs and policy education for farmers on liberating Taiwan, opposing the use of atomic weapons, and promoting compulsory military service, as well as propaganda and education on "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales."

    Organizing regular study is a complex and meticulous task, and regular leadership must be strengthened. This first requires the Party committees and governments at all levels to pay attention to it, and urge the education departments and mobilize relevant parties to do this work well, rather than just making general appeals without specific leadership. The education departments of governments at all levels should have special personnel to manage this work regularly. Some counties and districts have transferred too many full-time cadres of farmers' spare-time education to participate in other work, making them stay away from their own business for a long time, which is inappropriate and should be changed. Since farmers' spare-time cultural education is carried out in the vast countryside, strengthening the leadership of education work at the grassroots level (villages and agricultural production cooperatives) is of great significance. In the past, the reason why farmers' spare-time education was not well done in some places was mostly because the grassroots leadership was weak. This situation should be changed. The village branch and village government should regard farmers' spare-time education as one of the regular tasks, and actively lead, support, and supervise it, and solve problems related to farmers' spare-time education work in a timely manner.

### 认真组织农民的常年学习

    认真组织农民的常年学习
    目前正是各地冬学学习陆续转入常年学习的时候，各地党委和政府应当抓紧时机，加强对这一工作的指导，以保证广大农民的常年学习能够健康地进行。
    农民业余文化教育工作的任务是繁重的。我们要在第一个五年计划期间，争取在全国范围内基本上扫除乡级干部中的文盲；在农业生产合作社发展较早较有基础的地区，扫除大部分现有农业社社员和积极分子中的青壮年文盲和小部分非社员中的青壮年文盲；在其他地区争取一部分农业社社员、互助组组员、积极分子和其他青壮年文盲入学，并扫除一部分文盲。这一任务的实现，对于促进农村以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，将起一定的积极作用。为了完成这一任务，我们不仅必须努力办好冬学，并且必须在冬学结束之后继续组织农民进行经常性的学习，即所谓常年学习。
    过去几年的经验证明，凡是组织农民进行常年学习的地方，冬学的学习成绩就能得到巩固和提高；反之，就会产生“年年上冬学，年年从头学”的回生现象，这就不仅浪费了人力物力，而且严重地影响了有计划地扫除农民中的文盲和提高农民政治水平和文化水平的任务。因此在冬学结束之后，组织农民的常年学习，就成为农民业余文化教育工作中的主要任务。
    冬学学习是农民常年学习的基础。必须认真地检查和总结一九五四年的冬学工作，弄清情况，发现问题，取得经验和教训，作为组织今年常年学习的依据。首先要着重检查农民业余文化教育方针贯彻执行的情况。一九五四年的冬学是基本上贯彻了农民业余文化教育的方针的；但也存在不少的问题，主要的是有不少地方对方针的了解和贯彻还不够。比如有的人把第一次全国农民业余文化教育会议所规定的方针简单地理解为只在农业社办学。有的地方对组织乡村干部和积极分子学习重视不够。甚至有的地方因不了解提高农民的文化水平同实现农业的社会主义改造的关系，对这一工作采取了消极态度。这些缺点都应当在组织常年学习的工作中加以纠正。其次，要系统地总结农业社办学、组织乡村干部积极分子学习以及冬学的组织领导方面的经验，以指导今后的工作。此外，还要对冬学学员作一次成绩考核，对已达扫除文盲毕业程度的学员，举行毕业考试，使他们知道自己的实际成绩，以提高他们的学习信心，鼓励他们继续参加常年学习。
    多年来的农民业余文化教育实践证明了一条规律，这就是：农民的学习必须因时制宜，他们的学习进度和学习分量要同农事忙闲的程度相适应，根据农事忙闲的程度调整教学进度，增减学习分量。常年学习是在生产季节中进行的。它能不能坚持下去的关键，在于能不能解决学习同生产的矛盾。过去有些地方对这一问题的处理，存在着两种偏向：一种是看不到常年学习的有利条件，把生产同学习对立起来，采取了放任自流的态度；另一种是不研究农业生产季节的特点和群众生活条件，过分强调正规化的班级教学，以致学习同生产发生矛盾，许多农民无法参加学习，已入学的也不能坚持下去。这两种偏向都应当在今年的工作中加以克服。
    应该肯定：在春耕到秋收之间，一般农民是可以进行学习的。特别是已经组织起来的农民，由于生产时间比较一致，更加便于坚持常年学习。几年来的经验证明：要解决学习同生产的矛盾，首先要善于根据农事忙闲程度，确定学习进度。在农事不太忙的时候，可以保持一定的进度，教学一些新课；到农事较忙的时候，就要放慢教学进度，减少教课分量；到农事最紧张的时候，就要放假，忙过之后及时复课。其次，由于学员的情况不同，学习组织和进度也可以因人而不同。能集中学习的就集中学习，不能集中的就分散学习。如农业社社员和生产活动较少、生活负担较轻的青年，比较便于集中学习，他们的学习组织就可以比较集中一些；另外有些人不能集中学习，他们的学习组织就可以分散一些。对学习时间较多的人，教学进度可以适当地快一些；反之，就要慢一些。为了保证群众特别是乡村干部和积极分子的学习，必须合理地安排农村的各种会议时间和农业社、互助组的评分计工时间，给他们留出一部分学习时间。这样做，不仅是必要的，也是可能的。为要更好地解决学习同生产的矛盾，还必须充分发挥干部和群众的学习积极性。只要他们的积极性发挥了，他们就会根据自己的情况，采取可行的办法，克服一切困难，挤出时间，保证常年学习的正常进行。
    对农民常年学习的要求，也要因对象的不同而不同。对学习条件和学习基础较好的人，除了应该要求他们积极巩固冬学的学习成绩以外，还可以适当地学习新课；对于条件较差的人可以要求得低些，但是也要采取一切可行而有效的办法，使他们能够学习一些东西，至少也要使他们有时间温习旧课，避免回生现象。对于已经脱离文盲状态的学员，要特别注意巩固和提高他们的文化水平，要根据可能条件，为他们开办高小班（组）。对乡村干部和积极分子，也应该要求他们积极参加学习，以提高他们的政治和文化水平，并带动一般农民群众进行学习。在常年学习中，除文化学习以外，仍然应当结合农村各时期的中心任务进行政治学习。当前要着重向农民进行解放台湾、反对使用原子武器和推行义务兵役制等时事政策教育和“定产、定购、定销”的宣传教育。
    组织常年学习是一个复杂的、细致的工作，必须加强经常性的领导。这首先要依靠各级党委和政府对它的重视，并督促教育部门和动员有关方面做好这一工作，而不要只作一般号召，不进行具体领导。各级政府教育部门应当有专人经常管理这一工作。有些县区过多地抽调农民业余教育的专职干部参加其他工作，使他们长期脱离本身业务，这是不妥当的，应予改变。由于农民业余文化教育工作是在广大乡村进行的，加强基层（乡村和农业生产合作社）的教育工作领导有着重要的意义。过去有些地方的农民业余教育之所以办不好，多半因为基层领导薄弱。这种情况应当改变。乡支部、乡政府应当把农民业余教育当作经常工作之一，积极地予以领导、支持和监督，及时解决有关农民业余教育工作的问题。
