    The "Three Fixes" Policy Encourages Farmers in Yuexiaoqiao Village
    By Our Correspondent Liu Fan
    On March 14th, the news of implementing the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain reached Yuexiaoqiao Village in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province. The entire village's farmers immediately rejoiced, spreading the news: "The Communist Party has introduced another good policy!" Middle peasant Wang Miaoxing was in the field loosening wheat soil. After hearing this news, some of his previous concerns about the unified grain purchase and sales policy disappeared. He couldn't help but put down his tool and excitedly ran back from the field, laughing and saying, "I knew this was a good plan made by the Communist Party; they truly understand what we farmers are thinking!"

    That evening, the village's agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers held separate discussion meetings to discuss the grain "Three Fixes" policy. Everyone was in high spirits, and the meetings were very lively. Middle peasant Wang Fukang said, "The 'Three Fixes' method is very good. I plan to increase the area under small-plant, dense-planting by two mu this year and apply ten boatloads of mud fertilizer to the fields, striving to produce more grain." Wu Zhaokeng, the head of the Shushan Agricultural Production Cooperative, said, "With this method, our cooperative will be able to switch to double-cropping rice more smoothly this year." At the meeting, people spoke one after another, listing eight or nine benefits of implementing the "Three Fixes" policy.

    After the discussion meetings, the farmers' enthusiasm greatly increased. Members of the Shushan Agricultural Production Cooperative removed the three field ridges that were in the way, connecting the cooperative's fields into one. They said, "We don't want to withdraw from the cooperative anymore!" Within three days, thirty members went to Xiaoshan Street to collect three large boatloads, over ten thousand catties, of garbage, increasing the amount of fertilizer available for spring plowing. The amount of investment from members to the cooperative also increased. Member Tan Chunxing was previously unwilling to invest in the cooperative. After discussing the "Three Fixes" policy, he withdrew ninety yuan from the bank and invested it in the cooperative. After discussion by all members, the increased production plan was revised: to switch to double-cropping rice, implement small-plant, dense-planting, and strive to increase production by 15% this year; to develop pig farming, accumulate more fertilizer, and strive to raise three hundred pigs by the end of the year. There was a mutual aid team of eleven households in the village. After discussing the "Three Fixes" policy, they rented a boat and worked through the night to dredge river mud, and they planned to completely convert 107 mu of fields to small-plant, dense-planting, and increase double-cropping rice by 20%. Wang Miaoxing, a middle peasant, had two mu and two fen of low-lying fields that had not been fertilized with river mud in 1954. Now he has already dredged four boatloads of river mud and applied it to the fields, and he also plans to plant one more mu of double-cropping rice.

    “三定”政策鼓舞了岳小桥村的农民
    本报记者　刘凡
    三月十四日，实行粮食“定产、定购、定销”的消息传到了浙江省萧山县岳小桥村。全村的农民立即欢腾起来，大家奔走相告：“共产党又兴了个好政策！”中农汪妙兴正在田里撬麦泥，听到这个消息以后，原来对粮食统购统销政策的一些顾虑打消了，忍不住放下撬子，兴冲冲地从田里跑回来，又笑又说：“我知道这是共产党兴的好章程，他真摸到了我们庄稼人的心思！”
    这天晚上，村里的农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民都分别开座谈会，讨论粮食“三定”政策。大家情绪都很高，会议开得很热烈。中农汪福康说：“实行‘三定’的办法很好，我准备在今年增加二亩小株密植，在田里施十船泥肥，争取多打粮食。”蜀山农业生产合作社社长吴昭坑说：“有了这办法，今年我们社里就能更顺利地改种连作稻了。”会场上，你一句，他一句，关于实行“三定”政策的好处一共提出了八九条。
    开过座谈会，农民们的积极性大大提高。蜀山农业生产合作社的社员们把横在田里的三条田岸都锄掉，使社里的田连成了一片。他们说：“我们再也不想退社了！”三天内，有三十个社员上萧山街上打扫垃圾三大船、一万多斤，增加了春耕生产期间用的肥料。社员们向社里投资的数量也增加了。社员谭春兴过去不大愿意向社里投资，座谈了“三定”政策以后，他从银行里取出九十元投入社里。经过全体社员讨论，修订了增产计划：改种连作稻，进行小株密植，争取今年增产一成五；发展养猪事业，多积肥料，争取到年底养猪三百头。村里有一个十一户人家的互助组，他们座谈了“三定”政策以后，租了一只船，星夜赶捻河泥，并计划把一百零七亩田完全改为小株密植，增加十分之二的双季稻。中农汪妙兴的二亩二分低田，一九五四年没有施河泥，现在他已经捻了四船河泥，都施到田里，另外还准备多种一亩双季稻。
