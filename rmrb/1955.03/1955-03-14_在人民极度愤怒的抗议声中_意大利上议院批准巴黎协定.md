Xinhua News Agency, Rome: The Italian Senate conducted debates from February 24th to March 11th regarding the ratification of the Paris Agreements. On March 11th, manipulated by a reactionary majority, it passed the bill approving the Paris Agreements by a vote of 139 to 82.

During the debates, which lasted more than half a month, many senators spoke out to condemn the policies implemented by the Italian ruling clique. These policies promoted the revival of German militarism, caused Italy to lose its national independence, and subordinated the interests of the Italian nation to the war interests of the United States.

Communist and Socialist senators expressed the will of the Italian people striving for peace in the debates. They severely criticized the plan to arm West Germany.

Communist senators exposed that the reason why Western countries are arming West Germany and fabricating lies about a Soviet "threat" is because they fear peace and fear peaceful competition between the capitalist and socialist systems; the Paris Agreements can only harm Italy's national sovereignty and bring the burden of war to the people.

The Italian Senate's debate on ratifying the Paris Agreements began and ended amidst protests of extreme popular anger. Approximately two thousand delegations visited the Senate, demanding that the Paris Agreements not be ratified. The people also expressed their will by writing letters to the Senate, striking, and holding demonstrations.

Foreign news agencies revealed that Prime Minister Scelba hopes to carry the ratification document of the Paris Agreements in his pocket when he leaves for the United States at the end of March for a visit; U.S. Secretary of State Dulles expressed "great pleasure" upon learning of the Italian Senate's approval. However, the struggle is not over. Socialist Senator Lussu stated that the Socialist Party will continue to fight against Italy joining any aggressive military bloc. Communist Senator Scoccimarro said: The final decision will be made by the masses of the people.

    在人民极度愤怒的抗议声中
    意大利上议院批准巴黎协定
    据新华社讯：罗马消息：意大利上议院在二月二十四日到三月十一日进行了关于批准巴黎协定的辩论，并且在三月十一日由反动多数操纵，以一百三十九票对八十二票通过了批准巴黎协定的法案。
    在长达半个多月的辩论中，许多上议员发言谴责意大利统治集团实行的政策，这个政策促进复活德国军国主义，使意大利丧失民族独立，把意大利国家的利益服从于美国的战争利益。
    共产党上议员和社会党上议员在辩论中表达了争取和平的意大利人民的意志，他们严厉批评了武装西德的计划。
    共产党上议员揭露西方国家所以要武装西德，制造关于苏联“威胁”的谎言，是因为它们害怕和平，害怕进行资本主义制度同社会主义制度之间的和平竞赛；巴黎协定只能损害意大利的国家主权和给人民带来战争重担。
    意大利上议院关于批准巴黎协定的辩论是在人民极度愤怒的抗议声中开始和结束的。约有两千个代表团访问过上议院，要求不批准巴黎协定。人民还用给上议院写信、罢工、举行示威等办法表示他们的意志。
    外国通讯社透露，谢尔巴总理巴望他在三月底动身到美国访问时，衣袋里带着巴黎协定的批准书；美国国务卿杜勒斯在获悉意大利上议院批准的消息后表示“很高兴”。但是，斗争还没有结束，意大利社会党上议员卢素说过：社会党将继续为反对意大利加入任何侵略性军事集团而斗争。共产党上议员谢嘉说：最后的决定是要由人民群众做出来的。
