　  Tibetan women are participating in every new construction project and new production sector on the Kangzang Plateau. They have become active builders of the Kangzang Plateau.

　　In the arduous Kangzang Highway construction project, approximately six thousand Tibetan women participated in the construction, completing about 700,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work. Regardless of the biting wind and snow on the mountains or the continuous rain in the valleys, they, like the male workers, dug mud, transported materials, and chiseled rocks. For more than two years, they have erected tents in the barren mountains and forests, fighting against nature. During the road construction, more than six hundred female workers were commended for their contributions. On one section of the construction site, when road-building soldiers spoke of the Tibetan female worker Renze Lamu, they all praised her, saying, "Renze Lamu carries earth as fast as the wind, and one person's work is equal to two." In one earthwork operation, she alone loaded soil for four people to transport, and within a distance of seven meters, she transported 1,200 baskets of soil in a day. After work, she often led her male and female partners in dancing.

　　In various construction projects in Lhasa, Xigaze, Qamdo, and other places, thousands of Tibetan women worked shoulder to shoulder with male workers. From 1952 to the present, more than 3,000 female workers have participated in various construction projects in Lhasa alone. Together with Han and Tibetan male workers, they built hundreds of rooms for the Lhasa Veterinary Serum Manufacturing Plant, cadre school dormitories, and other buildings. Hundreds of female workers have received awards from the construction department, and some have been selected as "Xieben" (foremen) and team leaders. At the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station, there are eleven permanent female workers, and they have now become capable producers for the farm.

　　Many of these Tibetan female workers who participated in various construction projects have become permanent workers in various production and construction departments or have gone to schools to participate in learning. In the spring, various construction projects on the Kangzang Plateau have begun again. On the high mountains through which the highway passes, on the construction sites in the towns, and in the fields, Tibetan women are continuing to work bravely to build a new life.

    藏族妇女积极建设康藏高原
    康藏高原每项新的建筑工程和新的生产部门，都有藏族妇女参加。她们已成为康藏高原的积极建设者。
    在艰巨的康藏公路建筑工程中，约有六千名藏族妇女参加施工，她们完成的土、石方工程约七十万公方。不管山岭上凛冽的风雪，河谷里阴雨连绵，她们和男工一样挖泥、运料，开凿岩石。两年多来，她们在荒山森林里搭下帐篷，向大自然进行搏斗。在修路中，前后有六百多女工立了功。在某段工地上，筑路战士们一谈起藏族女工仁泽拉姆，都称赞说：仁泽拉姆背起土来快如风，干活一个当两个。在一次土方作业中，她一人装土供四个人运，在七公尺的距离内，她一天运土一千二百筐，下工后还常常带领男女伙伴们跳舞。
    在拉萨、日喀则、昌都等地的各种建设中，也有几千名藏族妇女和男工并肩作工。从一九五二年到现在，光是参加拉萨各项建筑的女工就有三千多人。她们和汉族、藏族的男工一起，修建了拉萨兽疫防治血清制造厂、干部学校校舍等房舍共几百间。成百名女工得到了建筑部门的奖励，有的被评选为“协本”（泥水工头）和组长。在拉萨农业试验场里，有十一个固定女工，她们现在已经成了农场得力的生产者。
    这些参加各项建设的藏族女工，已有许多人转为各生产建设部门的固定工人，或者到学校参加学习。春天，康藏高原的各项建设工程又开始了，在公路线通过的高山上，在城镇的建筑工地上，在田野里，藏族妇女们正继续为建设新生活而勇敢地劳动着。
