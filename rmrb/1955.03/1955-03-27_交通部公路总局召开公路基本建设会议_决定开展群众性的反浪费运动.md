    Ministry of Communications Highway Bureau Holds Basic Highway Construction Conference
    Decides to Launch Mass Anti-Waste Campaign

    [This newspaper dispatch] The Ministry of Communications Highway Bureau held a basic highway construction conference from February 21st to March 15th, deciding to launch a deep-going mass anti-waste campaign.

    The conference summarized the implementation of the 1954 basic highway construction plan, believing that highway basic construction work had made considerable progress over the past year. The investment amount completed 101.6% of the state plan, the construction and installation workload completed 101.6% of the state plan, and the completed mileage of newly built and rebuilt highways, in terms of central investment alone, reached 3,015 kilometers. The Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways, which have significant political and economic significance, were opened to traffic ahead of schedule. Highways in South China and East China and other regions were also completed on the dates stipulated in the state plan. The quality of the projects has improved to a certain extent compared with the past. The overall work efficiency throughout the year increased by 8% compared with the annual plan target, and the actual cost also decreased. Because more attention was paid to construction preparation work, the situation of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end was basically changed. In terms of survey and design, in addition to completing a large number of reconnaissance surveys and technical measurements, it also completed 1,765 kilometers of preliminary design and 1,669 kilometers of technical design. Hydrological and engineering geological investigation work has also improved.

    The conference, in accordance with the requirements of the state's general task during the transition period, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and focused on exposing the past work's large waste, high cost, low quality, and chaotic management. It was also believed that the root cause was the blind and rash advance sentiment in the planning guiding ideology. For example, the South China highway engineering plan was huge, the investment was excessively large, the standards were too high, the organization was bloated, and a large amount of materials were purchased before the construction plan was determined, resulting in capital accumulation. While the route was being surveyed, the construction team entered the construction site, resulting in a large amount of idleness and waste. The route was built and modified as it was surveyed, resulting in chaotic construction. The quality of the design documents of some lines was poor, failing to keep up with the needs of construction. For example, the Huangyu section of the Qing-Kang Road, 336 kilometers long, was surveyed three times in three years. After construction started, it was found that the design documents were still not applicable, so it had to be surveyed and built at the same time. In addition, neglecting construction preparation work and lacking planned overall deployment also caused confusion and waste in construction management.

    After analyzing the above situation, the conference decided to launch a deep-going, mass anti-waste campaign to thoroughly examine various problems and shortcomings in basic construction, and establish and improve the responsibility system on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses.

    The conference decided that in the future, highway construction should follow the policy of overall planning and focused construction, build important roads, continue to overcome the sentiment of blind and rash advance, and, according to the country's economic situation, adapt to local conditions and make the best use of money to build more roads, and implement the principles of economy and applicability. The conference decided to launch a study movement in the surveying and mapping departments to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and establish correct design ideas. Surveying and design work should be rationally arranged; existing technical forces should be used correctly, economic investigation work should be carried out systematically, surveying and design quotas should be formulated, and standard drawings that are urgently needed at present should continue to be designed. In terms of construction management, it is necessary to establish the view of comprehensively completing the state plan, oppose the one-sided thinking of only focusing on progress and neglecting cost and quality, as well as formalism in plan management, conscientiously compile construction organization design and technical organization measures plans, strengthen financial management, focus on promoting the economic accounting system, conduct economic activity analysis on a trial basis, and establish a specialized engineering supervision agency to strictly implement the engineering supervision system.

    The conference finally emphasized that in order to better complete the current highway construction tasks and prepare for the future development of highway construction, it is necessary to further consolidate and improve the existing construction team, strengthen political and ideological work, formulate long-term cadre training plans, and rectify and train the existing basic highway construction forces according to the plan.

    交通部公路总局召开公路基本建设会议
    决定开展群众性的反浪费运动
    【本报讯】交通部公路总局在二月二十一日到三月十五日举行了公路基本建设会议，决定深入开展群众性的反浪费运动。
    会议总结了一九五四年公路基本建设计划的执行情况，认为一年来公路基本建设工作有了不少进步，投资额完成国家计划的百分之一○一·六，建筑安装工作量完成国家计划的百分之一○一·六，新建和改建公路的竣工里程仅中央投资部分即达三千零十五公里，具有重大政治经济意义的康藏、青藏两大公路已提前通车。华南、华东等地区的公路也都按国家计划规定的日期竣工。工程质量较过去有了一定的提高，全年综合工效比年度计划指标提高了百分之八，实际成本也降低。由于比较注意了施工准备工作，基本上改变了前松后紧的情况。勘察设计方面除完成了大量的踏勘测量及技术测量外，还完成了一千七百六十五公里的初步设计及一千六百六十九公里的技术设计。水文地质和工程地质调查工作也有了改进。
    会议根据国家过渡时期总任务的要求，开展了批评和自我批评，集中揭发了过去工作中浪费大、成本高、质量低、管理混乱的情况。并认为根本原因在于计划指导思想上的盲目冒进情绪。如华南公路工程计划庞大，投资贪多，标准偏高，机构臃肿，修建方案未定便购置大量材料，造成资金积压。路线正在勘测，施工队伍便进入工地，造成大量窝工浪费。路线随测随修，随修随改，施工紊乱。有些线路的设计文件质量低劣，赶不上施工需要。如青康路黄玉段长三百三十六公里，三年测了三次，开工后发现设计文件仍不能应用，只好边测边修。此外，忽视施工准备工作，缺乏有计划的全盘部署，也造成施工管理上的混乱和浪费。
    会议分析了上述情况，决定开展一个深入的、群众性的反浪费运动，彻底检查基本建设中的各种问题和缺点，并在充分发动群众的基础上，建立与健全责任制度。
    会议决定，今后修建公路应按照统筹安排、重点建设的方针，修建重要的道路，继续克服盲目冒进情绪，根据国家的经济情况，因地制宜，做到少花钱，多修路，贯彻经济、适用的原则。会议决定要在测设部门中开展一次学习苏联先进经验和树立正确的设计思想的学习运动。测量和设计工作应该合理安排计划；正确地使用现有技术力量，系统地开展经济调查工作，制定测量、设计定额，并继续设计当前急需的标准图。在施工管理方面必须树立全面完成国家计划的观点，反对只重进度、忽视成本和质量的片面思想及计划管理中的形式主义，认真编好施工组织设计与技术组织措施计划，加强财务管理，重点推行经济核算制，试行经济活动分析，并建立专责的工程监理机构，严格执行工程监理制度。
    会议最后强调指出：为了更好的完成当前公路修建任务和为今后公路建设发展的需要作好准备，必须进一步巩固和提高现有的施工队伍，加强政治思想工作，制定长远的培养干部计划，按计划整顿和培养现有的公路基本建设力量。
