Farmers in Wenzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, are vigorously promoting double-season continuous rice cropping. In 1954, Wenzhou Prefecture planted 100,000 mu of double-season continuous rice; now it plans to expand this by another 620,000 mu. It is estimated that this will increase rice production by more than 74 million jin, accounting for over 32 percent of the prefecture's total planned increase this year. To accomplish this production increase task, relevant departments in various regions have prepared more than 1 million jin of superior rice seeds for farmers, most of which have already been delivered to them. Pingyang and other counties also plan to establish twenty-one district-level agricultural technology promotion stations to strengthen the cultivation technology work in promoting continuous rice cropping. At the same time, more than 20,000 technical backbone personnel have been trained in various regions, preparing to gradually establish township-level agricultural technology promotion networks. Currently, training work in most areas has been completed, and technical backbone personnel have returned to their hometowns to carry out their work. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have also formulated plans for planting continuous rice. In Pingyang County alone, more than 700 agricultural production cooperatives plan to convert more than 300,000 mu of intercropping rice fields into continuous rice fields. (Lin Xueli)

    温州专区农民扩种连作稻
    浙江省温州专区农民大力推广双季连作稻。一九五四年温州专区种植双季连作稻十万亩，现在准备再扩种六十二万亩，估计可增产水稻七千四百多万斤，占全专区今年总增产计划的百分之三十二强。为了完成这个增产任务，各地有关部门共为农民准备了一百多万斤优良稻种，现已大部运到农民手里。平阳等县还计划建立二十一个区农业技术推广站，加强推广连作稻中的耕作技术工作。同时各地还训练了二万多名技术骨干分子，准备逐步建立乡农业技术推广网。目前大部地区的训练工作都已结束，技术骨干分子已回乡开展工作。各地农业生产合作社也都订出了种植连作稻的计划，仅平阳县七百多农业生产合作社就计划把三十多万亩间作稻田改为连作稻田。（林学理）
