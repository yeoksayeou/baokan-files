Regarding "Lectures on Lu Xun's Novels"
Chen Mingshu

Mr. Xu Jie's "Lectures on Lu Xun's Novels" has not only been listed as a reference book for lecturing on Lu Xun's novels in some middle school and university Chinese language teaching, but also, during the 18th anniversary of Lu Xun's death in 1954, Shanghai's Xinmin Daily recommended it as one of the important reference books for studying Lu Xun's works. As a young man who loves literature, I would like to express some opinions on this book.

In "Lectures on Lu Xun's Novels," while emphasizing the study of "artistic expression forms," the author devalues the political value of Lu Xun's novels. The author says that because "the times are somewhat different," Lu Xun's "high artistic skill," compared to the ideological content of the works, "is more beneficial," so "what should be emphasized in learning" "is his artistic expression form" (p. 7). This is clearly a formalist point of view. If we start from this point of view, we cannot possibly recognize the value of Lu Xun's novels. The author describes Lu Xun's outstanding anti-feudal work "Diary of a Madman" as "just a psychological warfare propaganda book to persuade surrender" (p. 148), and considers the masterpiece "My Old Home," which depicts the blood and tears of peasants in old China, as "subjective lyricism" "based on sentimental feelings" (pp. 95, 89). This is not surprising at all.

The great value of Lu Xun's novels clearly lies first and foremost in its content, in its deep and broad popular nature, and in its thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideology. To depart from the revolutionary content of Lu Xun's novels and emphasize his superb artistic techniques is not only impossible to recognize the significance of Lu Xun's works, but also impossible to recognize the value of Lu Xun's "techniques." Mr. Xu Jie said: "Life and content cannot be learned, but viewpoints and artistic expression techniques can be learned from famous writers and successful works." (p. 173 – italics added by the author, same below) Just think: how can so-called "viewpoints" and "techniques" be expressed apart from "content"? How can "viewpoints" and "techniques" be learned separately without "content"?

On the issue of the relationship between theme and subject matter, Mr. Xu Jie's view is anti-realist. He sees the acquisition of the two as two unrelated things, so there are two methods: one, "first have the subject matter," and then "find a suitable theme to match it." This means that the theme does not appear in the life the author feels or in the subject matter selected, but can be forcibly added later. Two, "first have the theme," and then "find appropriate subject matter in real life" or even "in the world of imagination to show it." (p. 18) This merely believes that creation can be deduced by concepts and does not require reliance on life experiences. According to this point of view, analyzing the creative process of Lu Xun's novels can only lead to erroneous conclusions.

When dealing with the specific artistic features of a work, the author often uses formalist analysis methods to replace realist analysis. For example, the author imposes the writing method of "introduction, development, turn, and conclusion" on "Kong Yiji," and then praises it, saying, "How rigorous" the "backbone of the writing" is, it can be said to be "done in one breath" and "seamless" (pp. 169, 170). This is probably the artistic value of "Kong Yiji." At the end of "Diary of a Madman," the author even experiences "a distant reverie" because it "ends lightly and has a unique lingering charm" (p. 134). And "Medicine" and "My Old Home," and other articles, have also been added with similar praises. What kind of aesthetic point of view is this?

The principle error of Mr. Xu Jie in analyzing the content of Lu Xun's novels lies in his obliteration of the class contradictions truly reflected in them. For example, in the analysis of "My Old Home," he ignores the class contradictions reflected in the work, and describes it as Lu Xun expressing "the sorrow of the disillusionment of ideals" as "personal subjective lyricism," calling on readers to merely listen to "the low whisper of the author's pure soul."

He distorted Lu Xun's thoughts during the writing of "My Old Home," believing that Lu Xun was hesitant between "feudal manor life" and "modern social life," not knowing what to choose, and that this "contradiction" was the theme of "My Old Home" and "a true reflection of modern literary trends and even cultural thought" (p. 93). In the analysis of "My Old Home," the author even equates Lu Xun with the "all romantic subjective lyrical writers" of the bourgeoisie at that time, which cannot but be said to be a crude distortion of Lu Xun himself and his novel "My Old Home." As for saying that Lu Xun expressed the feelings of the declining landlord class in "My Old Home" (p. 100), and saying that the "ideal" expressed by Lu Xun in "My Old Home" is much more backward compared with Tolstoy (p. 107), etc., are equally absurd.

The immortal value of "My Old Home" lies in its realistic depiction of the typical environment of the countryside in old China at that time, and vividly shaping the typical image of a simple laboring peasant in old China like Runtu, who suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary rulers. Just like "The True Story of Ah Q" and other works by the author that describe the countryside at that time, the inevitable conclusion for readers is that the painful life of the vast number of peasants must be changed quickly; the semi-feudal and semi-colonial social environment must be changed; and the reactionary rulers who cruelly exploit the people must be overthrown. As for the revolutionary philosophical warning at the end of the novel, which directly calls on people to take action, is even more familiar to everyone. It can be seen that "My Old Home" is by no means just a piece of "personal subjective lyricism" as Mr. Xu Jie said, let alone a dirge for a declining feudal society.

Mr. Xu Jie believes that "Diary of a Madman" "is also just a psychological warfare propaganda book to persuade surrender" because Lu Xun's opposition to cannibalism is only "to persuade the cannibals to repent." (p. 148) The image of the "madman" leaps off the page, as Feng Xuefeng said: "It fiercely attacked the entire feudal system like never before, thus promoting the revolutionary movement at that time." Not starting from the entire spirit of the work, but making arbitrary judgments based on the formalist understanding of fragments of text, will inevitably devalue the work, reconcile and dilute the social contradictions reflected in it, and thus eliminate its positive educational significance.

Under the premise that Xia Yu is a "shadow figure," Mr. Xu Jie asserts that "Medicine" is a "novel without a protagonist" "centered on events," treating literary works merely as a pile of events and techniques, which is just repeating the old tune of formalism. Denying the image of Xia Yu also completely obliterates the great educational significance of this work.

Mr. Xu Jie examines the issue of literary creation from the anti-realist idealist standpoint, and as a result, falls into the quagmire of agnosticism. As a result, "Lectures on Lu Xun's Novels" is filled with self-contradictory and incomprehensible arguments. In the end, he even believes that the so-called novel works that "restore the real image of life through abstract written symbols" are subject to "different subjective conditions... and there is no certain standard" for researchers (p. 59), which is the same as what Yu Pingbo said: "The vision for criticizing literature is easily biased, so A is right and B is wrong with no standard." This eliminates the objective standard of literary criticism. Since there is no objective standard of truth, Mr. Xu Jie really felt more and more confused as he studied. He tells us: "Understanding or appreciating, or even studying a novel work, is sometimes just like blind men touching an elephant." (p. 62) This is a true portrayal of his research on Lu Xun's novels.

### 关于“鲁迅小说讲话”

    关于“鲁迅小说讲话”
    陈鸣树
    许杰先生的“鲁迅小说讲话”不但在一些大中学语文教学中被列为讲授鲁迅小说的参考书，而且在一九五四年鲁迅逝世十八周年时，上海新民报还把它推荐为研究鲁迅著作的重要参考书目之一。作为一个爱好文学的青年，我愿就这本书发表一点意见。
    “鲁迅小说讲话”的作者在强调学习“艺术表现形式”的同时，贬低了鲁迅小说的政治价值。作者说因为“时代有些不同”，鲁迅“高度的艺术手腕”，比起作品的思想内容来，“是更有补益的”，所以“应该强调学习的”，“倒是他的艺术表现形式这一部分”（页七）。这显然是形式主义的观点。如果从这种观点出发，我们就不可能认识鲁迅小说的价值。作者把鲁迅的杰出的反封建作品“狂人日记”说成“只是一篇劝降的心理战的宣传书”（页一四八），把描写旧中国农民血泪生活图景的杰作“故乡”看做“以感伤的心情为基调”的“主观的抒情的东西”（页九五、八九），那就毫不足奇了。
    鲁迅小说的伟大价值显然首先在于它的内容，在于它深广的人民性，在于彻底的不妥协的反帝反封建思想。离开鲁迅小说的革命内容，而强调他高明的艺术手法，这就非但无法认识鲁迅作品的意义，也无法认识鲁迅的“手法”的价值。许杰先生说：“生活与内容，是无从学习的，但观点与艺术的表现手法，却可以向成名的作家和成功的作品学习。”（页一七三——旁点引者所加，下同）试想：所谓“观点”和“手法”离开“内容”如何表现出来？脱离了“内容”，如何单独学习“观点”和“手法”？
    在主题和题材的关系问题上，许杰先生的观点是反现实主义的。他将两者的获得看作互不相干的两回事，因而就有两种方法：一，“先有了题材”，然后“再找一个适当的主题来配合他”。这就是说，主题不在作者所感受的生活中、所选取的题材中呈现出来，却可以另外硬加上去。二，“先有了主题”，“再在现实生活中”，甚至“想像世界中，找取适当的题材，加以显现”。（页一八）这无非认为创作可以用概念来演绎，毋须凭借生活感受。根据这种观点来分析鲁迅小说的创作过程，当然只能得出错误的论断。
    在涉及作品具体艺术特征时，作者常常以形式主义的分析方法来代替现实主义的分析。例如，作者给“孔乙己”套了“起承转合”的文章作法，然后赞赏道：“行文的骨干”“何等严密”，可以说“一气呵成”“天衣无缝”（页一六九、一七○）。这大概就是“孔乙己”的艺术价值了。在“狂人日记”结尾，作者竟体味到了“一个邈远的遐想”，因为它“轻轻一结，别有余韵”（页一三四）。而“药”和“故乡”等篇，也被他加上了类似的称赞。这是什么美学观点呢？
    许杰先生分析鲁迅小说的内容时的原则性的错误在于他抹煞其中所真实反映的阶级矛盾。例如在
  “故乡”分析中，他忽视了作品所反映的阶级矛盾，把它说成鲁迅抒发“理想的幻灭的悲哀”的“个人主观的抒情的东西”，叫读者仅仅去听“作者的纯洁的灵魂的低诉”。
    他对鲁迅在写作“故乡”期间的思想作了曲解，认为鲁迅徬徨于“封建农庄生活”和“近代社会生活”之间，莫知抉择，而这个“矛盾”正是“故乡”的主题，“也是近代文艺思潮甚至文化思想的真实的反映”（页九三）。在对“故乡”的分析中，作者竟把鲁迅和当时资产阶级“一切浪漫主义的主观的抒情文学的作家”等同起来，这不能不说对鲁迅本人及其小说“故乡”作了粗暴的歪曲。至于说鲁迅在“故乡”中表现了没落的地主阶级的感情（页一○○），说鲁迅在“故乡”中所表现的
  “理想”，同托尔斯泰比较起来，还要落后得多（页一○七）等等，同样是极荒唐的。
      “故乡”的不朽价值，在于真实地描写了当时旧中国农村的典型环境，并且生动地塑造了闰土这样一个饱受反动统治者的剥削和压迫的旧中国淳朴劳动农民的典型。正如“阿Q正传”以及作者其他描写当时农村的作品一样，它使读者必然得出的结论是：必须迅速改变广大农民的痛苦生活；必须改变半封建半殖民地的社会环境；必须打倒残酷压榨人民的反动统治者。至于小说结尾这段直接号召人们行动起来的含有革命哲理的警语，更为大家所熟知的。可见“故乡”绝不如许杰先生所说，仅仅是一篇“个人主观的抒情的东西”，更不是一首凭吊没落的封建社会的挽歌。
    许杰先生认为“狂人日记”“也只是一篇劝降的心理战的宣传书”，理由是鲁迅反对吃人的方法，仅是“要劝转吃人的人，要他们悔改。”（页一四八）跃然纸上的“狂人”的形象，正如冯雪峰所说：“空前猛烈地攻击了整个封建制度体系，因而促进了当时的革命运动。”那种不从作品整个精神出发，却根据片段文字的形式主义了解妄下判断，这样也就必然会贬低作品的价值，调和冲淡其中所反映的社会矛盾，从而取消它积极的教育意义。
    在夏瑜是“影子的人物”的前提下，许杰先生断定“药”是一篇“以事件为中心”的“没有主人翁的小说”，把文学作品仅仅作为事件和技巧的堆砌，不过再一次重复了形式主义的调头。否定夏瑜的形象，当然也同样整个抹煞了这一作品的巨大教育意义。
    许杰先生站在反现实主义的唯心论立场上考察文艺创作问题，结果就陷于不可知论的泥坑。也就使“鲁迅小说讲话”里不得不充满了自相矛盾、莫知究竟的论点。最后他竟认为，所谓“借抽象的文字符号所还原的人生实象”的小说作品，要受研究者的“主观条件……的不同而不同，没有一个一定的标准的。”（页五九），这正如俞平伯的说法一样：“批评文学的眼光是很容易有偏好的，所以甲是乙非了无标准”。这就取消了文艺批评的客观标准。既然没有了客观真理标准，许杰先生真是越研究越觉得糊涂了。他告诉我们：“理解或者欣赏甚至研究一篇小说作品，有些时候，正有如盲人扪象。”（页六二）这正是他研究鲁迅小说的真实写照。
