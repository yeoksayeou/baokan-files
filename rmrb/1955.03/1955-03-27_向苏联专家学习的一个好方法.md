A Good Way to Learn from Soviet Experts
    Gao Xuting
    In 1954, the design system of the First Ministry of Machine Building (hereinafter referred to as: Design General Bureau) held a series of professional design experience exchange meetings. Facts have proved that this is a good method to cultivate cadres and learn from Soviet experts.
    In the past two years, the design system of the Design General Bureau has concentrated thousands of engineers and technicians to engage in design work. Among these designers, some came from factories and originally engaged in production work; others came from schools and were completely unfamiliar with factory design. The factory designs they are currently undertaking are all carried out with the help and guidance of Soviet experts. When encountering design principles and key issues, it is difficult to solve them without experts. In the past two years, experts have made thousands of suggestions for factory design, ensuring the quality and progress of the design. However, due to the large number of designers and the small number of experts, and the lack of a system for exchanging expert suggestions, it is difficult for all designers to know the experts' suggestions. For example, the suggestions made by experts in the Third Design Sub-bureau are not known to the Fourth Design Sub-bureau, and even within a sub-bureau, the suggestions made by experts to a professional section are only known to those who design Factory A, but not to those who design Factory B. This makes it difficult for designers to systematically learn from Soviet advanced experience. Some people who are in frequent contact with experts regard experts as technical "living dictionaries." When encountering technical problems, they do not first study them or check whether the expert has spoken about them, and instead always consult the expert. Therefore, experts sometimes refute them, saying: "I have talked about this issue three or four times, why are you asking me again?"
    Based on the above situation, the Design General Bureau decided to comprehensively summarize expert suggestions and systematically learn from Soviet advanced experience through professional experience exchange meetings in order to achieve the purpose of cultivating cadres and improving design standards. According to this policy, a series of professional experience exchange meetings on metalworking assembly design, casting, forging and heat design, sanitary technology design, power supply design, general layout and transportation design, and economic budgeting have been held over the past year under the guidance of experts, with approximately 700 people directly participating in the meetings. Each meeting first systematically sorted out expert suggestions. The metalworking assembly, general layout and transportation, casting, and power design exchange meetings all gave a comprehensive and systematic summary of the fragmented, partial, and one-issue-at-a-time suggestions made by experts in various design units in their daily work. For example, the general layout design experience exchange meeting summarized the suggestions made by expert Mao Gujin on general layout design in the past two years, which were divided into three major categories: general layout planning, warehouse, and transportation design. The summary also concretized the suggestions for each project, such as dividing transportation design into in-plant transportation, off-plant transportation, rail transportation, and trackless transportation, as well as how to select transportation equipment and how to calculate transportation volume... The summary also explained the circumstances and conditions under which the experts' suggestions were made, and how the designers understood them in their actual work. This systematic summary and exchange of expert suggestions made the designers feel that "the problems we need to solve now have already been raised by experts," and on the other hand, the experts who guided the design also felt satisfied. After hearing the "Comprehensive Report on Expert Suggestions" at the meeting, expert Mao Gujin said: "They (referring to the designers) have basically understood my suggestions."
    The second content of the experience exchange meeting was to collectively summarize the experience in design work, that is, the experience of learning and implementing Soviet advanced design technology and implementing expert suggestions. For example, the casting design experience exchange meeting, through the discussion of the layout of casting workshops in four factories, collectively summarized more than 30 different design experiences: some workshop designs adopted П-shaped factory buildings, which had good lighting, good ventilation, and good working conditions; other workshops designed good production lines, making processes such as ore feeding, sand return, molding, melting, and casting very convenient and reasonable. Therefore, everyone believed that these experiences could be selected under different conditions.
    The third content of the experience exchange meeting was to compile design guidance materials under the guidance of experts. Metalworking assembly, tool machine repair, power supply, casting, and other design specialties have respectively compiled standard formats for preliminary design or technical design (this format includes design depth, content, and method). The economic budgeting experience exchange meeting stipulated economic budgeting regulations. The sanitary technology design experience exchange meeting put forward unified implementation opinions on the Soviet "Fire Protection Standards" and "Sanitary Standards." The general layout design experience exchange meeting unified the legend of the general layout. In order to improve the level of leading cadres, an experience exchange meeting for chief design engineers is being prepared under the guidance of experts. At the suggestion of experts, some experience exchange meetings also exhibited design materials from abroad and at home, allowing designers to observe and compare each other on the one hand, and indirectly learn a lot of Soviet advanced design experience on the other hand. All of these have laid the foundation for future formal design.
    Many experience exchange meetings were personally guided by Soviet experts, who answered questions and provided new design materials. In addition, experts from different specialties, based on the existing level of the designers and the needs of current technical design, made special reports at relevant experience exchange meetings, giving designers a lot of basis for future design work. For example, expert Soloviev made a report on "Design of Metalworking Assembly Workshops in the Technical Design Stage" at the metalworking professional design experience exchange meeting, specifically explaining the specific practices of technical design of metalworking assembly workshops, and explaining how to organize flow production under different production conditions, especially focusing on the organization of batch production lines in response to the needs of the current design tasks. The designers believed that the expert's report was an important issue that urgently needed to be resolved in our current design work. Another example is that expert Mao Gujin made a systematic summary report on the basic principles of general layout design, which more clearly pointed out the direction of design. Other experience exchange meetings also had experts make special reports or question and answer reports.
    The more concise and focused the content of the exchange meeting, the greater the harvest of the meeting. For example, the power supply design exchange meeting, in addition to systematically summarizing expert suggestions, only discussed two projects: compensating power supply factor and compiling standard formats. Because the issues exchanged were more concentrated, the study was deeper and more thorough. After the meeting, many designers said: "Although the time for this meeting was very short, we returned with a full load." On the contrary, some experience exchange meetings attempted to solve all the problems at one meeting, resulting in exchanges that were neither deep nor thorough.
    Through these experience exchange meetings, the ideological level of designers has been greatly improved. First, ideological understanding was unified through criticism and self-criticism. At the metalworking design experience exchange meeting, there were initially two different debates on the standardization of labor quotas: one was to mechanically transplant Soviet advanced experience, and to generally multiply the Soviet quota indicators by adjustment coefficients; the other was the opposite, relying entirely on one's own narrow experience, and generally compressing on-site data. The meeting criticized these two erroneous ideas, and jointly believed that the standardization of labor quotas should be based on Soviet advanced data on the one hand, and closely combined with on-site conditions on the other hand, and a realistic attitude should be taken to make specific analysis of specific problems. Only in this way can the standardization of labor quotas be neither conservative nor冒进 (maojin, recklessly advance). At the same time, experience exchange further promoted designers' demand to learn from experts. At the general layout design experience exchange meeting, through experience exchange, the designers unanimously believed that due to the earnest implementation of expert suggestions, the Fourth Design Sub-bureau summarized better experience in pipeline layout, and the Taiyuan Design Office summarized better experience in elevation layout. On the contrary, some designers did not pay enough attention to learning from experts on weekdays, and did not pay attention to summarizing their own work experience, so they could not come up with mature experience to exchange at the meeting. Therefore, they said: "If it doesn't work this year, we'll see you next year. We must honestly learn from experts in the future."
    In short, through experience exchange meetings, the design system of the Design General Bureau has initially unified some design practices, and began to communicate design materials between expert suggestions and design sub-bureaus. And through the compilation of design materials, many design regulations and systems have been established. Many designers believe that this kind of meeting can learn from each other and improve together. Therefore, they requested that this kind of experience exchange meeting should be held frequently, because this is a good method to cultivate cadres and learn from Soviet experts.

    向苏联专家学习的一个好方法
    高煦亭
    一九五四年，第一机械工业部设计总局（以下简称：设计总局）系统召开了一系列的专业设计经验交流会，事实证明：这是培养干部，向苏联专家学习的一个良好方法。
    最近两年来，设计总局系统集中了数以千计的工程技术人员从事设计工作。在这些设计人员中，有的来自工厂，原来搞生产工作；有的来自学校，对工厂设计，完全是陌生的。他们目前所负担的工厂设计，都是在苏联专家帮助和指导下进行的。遇到设计上的原则问题和关键性的问题，几乎离了专家就很难解决。两年来专家对工厂设计提了成千成万条的建议，保证了设计的质量和进度。但是，因设计人员多，专家少，而且又没有交流专家建议的制度，所以就很难使所有的设计人员都知道专家的建议。例如：专家在第三设计分局的建议，第四设计分局就不知道，甚至专家在一个分局内对一个专业科的建议，只有设计甲厂的人知道，设计乙厂的人不知道。这就使设计人员不能系统地学习苏联先进经验。而有的经常接触专家的人，则把专家当成技术上的“活字典”，遇到技术问题，自己不先研究，也不查查专家是否讲过，就一律请教专家。因而专家有时反驳他们说：“这个问题我已讲过三、四遍了，怎么又来问我？”
    根据以上情况，设计总局决定：通过专业的经验交流会议，全面地总结专家建议，系统地学习苏联先进经验，以达到培养干部，提高设计水平的目的。根据这一方针，一年来在专家指导下，召开了金工装配设计、铸造、锻热设计、卫生技术设计、电力供应设计、总图运输设计、经济预算等一系列的专业经验交流会议，直接参加会议的有七百人左右。每次会议首先系统地整理了专家建议。金工装配、总图运输、铸造、电力等设计交流会议，都把专家在各设计单位日常所提的片断的、局部的、一个问题一个问题的建议，给以全面地系统地总结。如总图设计经验交流会议，总结了毛古金专家两年来对总图设计所提的建议，其中分总平面布置、仓库和运输设计三大项目。总结又把每一项目的建议都具体化了，如把运输设计分为厂内运输、厂外运输，有轨运输和无轨运输，以及怎样选用运输设备和怎样计算运输量……。在总结中还说明专家的建议是在什么情况、什么条件下提出的，设计人员在实际工作中是怎样体会的。对专家建议这样系统地总结和交流，一方面使设计人员感到：“我们当前需要解决的问题，专家早已提出了”；另一方面指导设计的专家也感到满意。毛古金专家在会上听到“专家建议的综合报告”后，说：“他们（指设计人员）对我的建议基本上体会了。”
    经验交流会议的第二个内容是：集体总结设计工作中的经验，也就是学习贯彻苏联先进设计技术和贯彻专家建议的经验。例如铸工设计经验交流会，通过四个厂的铸工车间平面布置的讨论，集体总结了三十多条大小不同的设计经验：有的车间设计，采用П型的厂房，采光好，通风好，劳动条件好；有的车间则设计的生产路线好，使送矿、回砂、造型、熔化、浇铸等工序都很方便和合理。因此，大家认为：这些经验，都可以在不同的条件下加以选用。
    经验交流会的第三个内容是：在专家指导下，整编设计的指导资料。金工装配、工具机修、电力供应、铸造等设计专业都分别编制了初步设计或技术设计的标准格式（这种格式，包括设计深度、内容和方法）。经济预算经验交流会规定了经济预算条例。卫生技术经验交流会对苏联“防火标准”和“卫生标准”提出了统一执行的意见。总图设计经验交流会，统一了总平面的图例。为了提高领导干部水平，已在专家指导下，准备召开设计主任工程师经验交流会。有的经验交流会，在专家提议下，还展览了国外设计和国内设计的资料，使设计人员一方面得以互相观摩比较，另一方面间接地学习了不少苏联的先进的设计经验。所有这些，都为今后正规设计打下了基础。
    有许多经验交流会议，都有苏联专家亲自指导，解答问题，并供给新的设计资料。另外，不同专业的专家，根据设计人员现有水平，及当前技术设计的需要，分别在有关经验交流会上做了专题报告，给予设计人员在今后设计工作中以很多依据。如索洛威依专家在金工专业设计经验交流会上，做了“技术设计阶段金工装配车间设计”的报告，具体说明了金工装配车间技术设计的具体做法，并说明在生产性质不同的条件下，如何组织流水生产，特别是针对目前设计任务的需要，对于组织成批生产的流水线着重地进行了分析。设计人员认为：专家的报告，是我们当前设计工作中急待解决的重要问题。又如毛古金专家对总平面设计的基本原则做了系统的总结性报告，更明确地指出了设计的方向。其他经验交流会也都有专家做专题报告或问题解答报告。
    交流会的内容越是扼要、集中，会议的收获也越大。例如电力供应设计交流会议，除了系统地总结了专家建议外，只讨论了补偿供电因数和编制标准格式两个项目。由于交流的问题比较集中，钻研的较深也较透。会后，不少设计人员说：“这次会议时间虽然很短，但我们却满载而归。”相反的，有些经验交流会，企图把所有的问题都在一次会议上解决，结果，交流的不深也不透。
    通过这些经验交流会议，设计人员的思想水平大大提高了。首先通过批评与自我批评，统一了思想认识。在金工设计经验交流会议上，对于标定工时定额，开始有着两种不同的争论：一种是机械地搬运苏联的先进经验，按照苏联的定额指标，笼统地乘以调整系数；另一种则相反，完全凭自己的狭隘的经验，将现场资料一般地加以压缩。会议中批判了这两种错误的思想，共同认为：对于劳动定额的标定，一方面要以苏联的先进资料做根据；另一方面要密切结合现场情况，以实事求是的态度，对具体问题，作具体的分析。只有这样，工时定额的标定，才能既不保守，又不冒进。同时，通过经验交流，进一步促进了设计人员向专家学习的要求。在总平图设计经验交流会上，通过经验交流，设计人员一致认为：由于认真贯彻了专家建议，第四设计分局对管道布置，太原设计处对立面布置，都总结出来了比较好的经验。相反的有些设计人员由于平日向专家学习不够，没有注意总结自己工作中的经验，因而也就拿不出成熟的经验来在会议上交流。因此，他们表示：“今年不行来年见，今后一定要老老实实地向专家学习。”
    总之，设计总局系统通过经验交流会议，对某些设计的做法，初步统一起来了，对专家建议和设计分局之间的设计资料，开始沟通起来了。并且通过整编设计资料，建立了不少设计的章程和制度。许多设计人员认为：这种会议，能够互相学习，共同提高。因此，他们要求，这种经验交流会议，要经常召开，因为这是培养干部，向苏联专家学习的一个良好方法。
