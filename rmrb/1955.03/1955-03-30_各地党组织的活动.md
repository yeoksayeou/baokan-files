Helping the Masses Solve Difficulties in Spring Plowing

    In Sanduo Village, Jinning County, Yunnan Province, some farmers were not very enthusiastic about spring plowing due to financial difficulties. A farmer named Feng Biao, for example, had no money to buy grain, so his wife had to take their children back to her parents' home, and his production morale was very low. The Party小组 (Party cell) in the village felt that this was a serious problem and reported it to the township branch. The branch immediately pointed out to the Party小组 that helping the masses solve their difficulties must be regarded as an important task, and demanded that the Party小组 conduct an in-depth investigation into the difficulties of the masses, and help them solve their difficulties according to their different situations, such as those with and without labor power, those with current difficulties and those who will soon have difficulties. After an in-depth investigation, the Party小组 found that twenty-nine peasant families in the village had no food to eat, so they tried to help them solve the problem. Some were organized to transport grain for the grain bureau, some were organized to make straw sandals, or engage in other handicrafts. For general households in difficulty in agricultural cooperatives, the Party小组 educated them to work hard and mobilized the cooperative to advance some money to them; some farmers had difficulties in production, and the Party小组 helped them apply for loans from the credit cooperatives. Now the credit cooperatives have lent 81 yuan to households in difficulty, solving the difficulties of twenty-nine families. In order to prevent famine among the masses in May and June, the Party小组 is actively mobilizing the masses to plant early-maturing crops such as taro. Two agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have planted more than 2.8 dou of taro seeds in three days. (Xiong Debao)

Ensuring the Formulation of Advanced Plans

    The chemical plant's coal washing workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company has increased its production plan for this year by 40.6% compared with last year. When the plan was first discussed, many people shouted that it was difficult. The director and deputy director of the workshop and many employees believed that the equipment in the coal washing workshop was too old and there were too many accidents. Without adding new equipment, it would be impossible to complete this year's production tasks. Therefore, some people demanded that the No. 6 belt conveyor be repaired. Repairing the No. 6 belt conveyor was not an easy task, requiring a state investment of 450,000 yuan. The Party general branch of the workshop disagreed with this approach. At this time, Zhu Baoyuan, Li Wanjiang, and others in the coal storage section were planning to study how to improve operating methods to increase coal delivery, and the general branch actively supported this approach. The general branch also convened workers, technicians, and advanced producers for discussions, listened to their opinions on improving production, and asked technicians to calibrate the transport capacity of the existing belt conveyors. The calibration results showed that the existing belt conveyors only发挥 (exerted) 80% of their actual transport capacity. The general branch committee held a special discussion on this issue, and a fierce debate unfolded at the meeting. The director and deputy director of the workshop repeatedly emphasized that it was impossible to complete the task without adding equipment. The general branch secretary and others cited facts to illustrate that the transport capacity of the existing belt conveyors had not been fully utilized. After discussion, the workshop director and others also realized that they had almost caused huge waste to the country in order to save themselves trouble and "sleep soundly." Finally, it was decided to remove the repair of the No. 6 belt conveyor from the technical measures plan. After the meeting, the Party general branch and the Communist Youth League specifically helped the workers in the coal storage section improve operating methods, shorten the coal changing time, implement continuous coal changing, and reduce the phenomenon of the belt conveyors running empty. At present, the efficiency of coal delivery has been significantly improved, and coal is now being delivered to the newly commissioned No. 3 coking workshop. (Shi Yongwei)

Correcting 社员 (Cooperative Member) Thoughts of Emphasizing Sideline Occupations and Neglecting Agriculture

    When Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, was formulating this year's agricultural production plan, the idea that production had reached its peak and there was little potential for growth was relatively common within the cooperative. The 社员 (Cooperative Members) believed that to develop production and increase income, they could only find ways through sideline occupations. Some 社员 (Cooperative Members) said: "Finding a large area in agriculture is not worth a little bit in sideline occupations." 社员 (Cooperative Members) were not active in formulating agricultural production increase plans. After the Party branch of this cooperative understood the above-mentioned thoughts of the 社员 (Cooperative Members), it immediately held a meeting to study and decided to use the examples of how the cooperative had increased income by developing production in accordance with the state's plans over the past few years to educate the 社员 (Cooperative Members) on the management policy of focusing on the development of agricultural production. After the meeting, Party members and activists in the cooperative went into each production team to educate the 社员 (Cooperative Members) through accounting and comparison, using the facts that the government had supplied chemical fertilizers and helped improve agricultural tools over the past few years, thus enabling the entire cooperative to increase production year after year. Through this education, the 社员 (Cooperative Members) realized that only by carrying out agricultural production in accordance with the state's plans and supporting the country's industrialization can agricultural production be further developed and the lives of the peasants gradually improved. In this way, five agricultural production teams in the cooperative successively summarized the experience of improving farming techniques and improving management and administration in 1954, studied the production increase potential of each piece of land, and formulated plans to increase production by 10% to 20% compared with 1954.

Training Ethnic Minority Party Member Cadres

    The Party School of the CPC Xikang Provincial Committee has opened a training class for ethnic minority cadres to train ethnic minority Party member cadres in Xikang Province. The students participating in the first phase of study have successively arrived at the school for registration. Ninety-four Party member cadres of Tibetan, Yi, Hui, Lisu, Miao and other ethnic groups have registered. The training class officially started in late March.
    The duration of this study period is set at one and a half years. It is planned to spend one year studying language and then half a year studying theory and policy. It is required that through study, the students' ideological awareness be further improved so that they can become leading cadres with culture, understanding of policies, and certain professional skills, so as to create favorable conditions for further开展 (carrying out) work in ethnic minority areas in the future.

Holding a Political Economy Training Class

    In the second half of 1955, some cadres in Beijing will study political economy. In order to train the backbone for studying political economy, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, in coordination with the Municipal Party School, has transferred some theoretical education cadres, instructors and tutors of intermediate theory study groups, and students of intermediate theory study groups from municipal agencies to hold a political economy training class.
    This training class plans to use the soon-to-be-published Soviet "Textbook of Political Economy" as teaching material, and appropriately supplement some Marxist-Leninist classics. The focus of the students' study is on the third part of the "Textbook of Political Economy" - the socialist mode of production, so that the students can understand various economic laws of socialism and improve their theoretical knowledge about socialist construction.
    This training class has invited comrades from the Political Economy Teaching and Research Section of the Renmin University of China to serve as teachers, and has determined the principle of combining theory with practice, especially with the practice of China's socialist economic construction, as the teaching policy. The learning method is mainly lecturing and self-study, with focused discussions, and appropriate collective or individual tutoring and answering questions. (Jiang Xue)

Paying Attention to Party Education for New Party Members

    Under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the Party committees of various factories and mines in Lüda City have used their spare time to train and educate new Party members in the form of part-time training classes, self-study classes, and regular Party lectures. The content of education is generally based on the "Eight Questions on the Standards of Communist Party Members" and "Basic Knowledge of the Party" designated by the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee, and at the same time, attention is paid to combining it with the main ideological conditions of the Party members of each branch and the outstanding problems existing in the production of each factory and mine. In 1954, more than 7,000 new Party members received such training. The political awareness and ideological level of the new Party members who have been trained have been greatly improved. Comrade Sun Yongge, a Party member of the No. 2 Branch of the Hardware Factory, only cared about doing his own work well before studying; after studying, he clarified the truth that he must rely on the masses and lead the masses to do a good job in production. Therefore, when the factory encountered difficulties in processing lamp holders for other factories, he actively discussed it with the workers in the group. They adopted the method of multiple knives and multiple blades, which increased the output by one and a half times, the quality was 100% qualified, and ensured that the processing tasks were completed on schedule.

    各地党组织的活动
    帮助群众解决春耕中的困难
    云南省晋宁县三多村有些农民由于生活困难，春耕生产的积极性不高。有个名叫冯彪的农民，就因为家中没钱买粮食，老婆只好带着孩子回娘家去了，他的生产情绪很不好。村里的党小组觉得这个问题很严重，就向乡支部作了汇报。支部立即向这个党小组指出，必须把帮助群众解决困难当作一件重要工作，并要求党小组深入调查群众的困难情况，要根据有劳动力的和没劳动力的、现在有困难的和不久要有困难的等不同情况，分别帮助他们解决困难。党小组深入调查后，发现全村有二十九家农民没有口粮吃，就想办法帮助他们解决，有的组织起来给粮食局运粮食、有的组织起来打草鞋，或搞其他的手工业。对农业社中的一般困难户，党小组就教育他们好好劳动，并动员社内预支一部分钱给他们；有些农民在生产中有困难，党小组就帮助他们向信用合作社申请贷款。现在信用合作社已贷给困难户八十一元，解决了二十九家的困难。为了防止群众在五六月间再发生饥荒，党小组正积极动员群众种芋头等早熟作物，有两个农业生产合作社和互助组已在三天内种下了两石八斗多芋头的种子。（熊德宝）
    保证制订先进计划
    鞍山钢铁公司化工总厂洗煤车间，今年的产量计划比去年提高了百分之四十点六。在开始讨论计划时，很多人都喊叫困难。车间主任、副主任和许多职工都认为洗煤车间的设备太旧，事故多，不增加新设备，没法完成今年的生产任务。于是有人要求修复六号皮带机。修复六号皮带机并不是一件轻而易举的事情，需要国家投资四十五万元。车间党总支不同意这个办法。这时，贮煤工段朱宝元、李万江等正打算研究改进操作方法增加送煤量，总支便积极支持这种作法。总支又召集工人、技术人员和先进生产者们座谈，听取他们提高生产的意见，并请技术员标定了现有皮带机的运输量，标定结果证明现有皮带机的运输能力实际只发挥了百分之八十。总支委员会对这个问题作了专门讨论，会上展开了激烈的争论。车间主任、副主任再三强调不增加设备不可能完成任务。总支书记等便举出事实来说明现有皮带机运输能力还没有充分发挥。经过讨论，车间主任等也认识到为了自己省事“睡宽心觉”而几乎给国家造成巨大浪费。最后决定把修复六号皮带机从技术措施方案中勾销了。会后，党总支和青年团具体帮助贮煤工段的工人改进了操作方法，缩短了换煤时间，实行连续换煤，减少了皮带机的跑空现象。目前，送煤的效率已显著提高，并且开始给新投入生产的第三炼焦车间送煤。（石永伟）
    纠正社员重副业轻农业的思想
    湖北省浠水县望城乡饶兴礼农业生产合作社，在制订今年的农业生产计划时，社内比较普遍地存在着生产到顶、潜力不大的思想。社员们认为要发展生产，增加收入，只有从副业上找门路。有的社员说：“农业上找一大片，抵不到副业上的一点点。”社员们对于制订农业增产计划都不积极。这个社的党支部了解了社员上述的思想情况以后，当即开会作了研究，决定用几年来这个社按照国家的计划发展生产，因而增加了收入的实例，向社员进行以发展农业生产为主的经营方针的教育。会后，党员和社内积极分子一起深入每个生产队，用几年来由于政府供应化学肥料和帮助改良农具等，因而使全社连年增产的事实向社员进行了算账、对比的教育。社员通过这些教育，认识到了只有按照国家的计划进行农业生产，支援国家工业化建设，农业生产才能得到进一步的发展，农民的生活也才能逐步地改善。这样，全社有五个农业生产队先后总结了一九五四年改进耕作技术和改善经营管理工作的经验，研究了每一块田的增产潜力，订出了比一九五四年增产一成到两成的计划。　（据新华社讯）
    训练少数民族党员干部
    中共西康省委党校开办民族干部训练班，训练西康省少数民族党员干部。参加第一期学习的学员已陆续到校报到。报到的学员已有藏、彝、回、傈僳、苗等民族的党员干部九十四人。训练班于三月下旬正式开课。
    这期的学习时间订为一年半，计划用一年时间学习语文，再用半年时间学习理论政策。要求通过学习，进一步提高学员的思想觉悟，使成为有文化、懂政策，并具有一定业务能力的领导骨干，为今后进一步开展少数民族地区工作创造有利条件。
                                      （康）
    举办政治经济学训练班
    一九五五年下半年北京市将有部分干部学习政治经济学。为了培养学习政治经济学的骨干，中共北京市委宣传部已协同市委党校，从市属各机关抽调了部分理论教育工作干部、理论学习中级组的传授员、辅导员和理论学习中级组的学员，举办了一个政治经济学训练班。
    这个训练班计划以即将出版的苏联“政治经济学教科书”为教材，并适当地补选一些马克思列宁主义的经典著作。学员们的学习重点放在“政治经济学教科书”的第三篇——社会主义的生产方式部分，以便使学员们能够了解社会主义的各种经济规律，提高他们关于社会主义建设的理论知识。
    这个训练班已经请到中国人民大学政治经济学教研室的同志担任教员，并且已经确定了以理论联系实际、特别是联系我国社会主义经济建设的实际的原则为教学方针。学习方法是以讲课、自学为主，有重点地进行讨论，适当地进行集体或个别辅导和解答问题。　（江雪）
    注意对新党员进行党的教育
    旅大市各厂矿党委在市委的领导下，利用业余时间，采用业余训练班、自学班、定期上党课等形式，对新党员进行了训练和教育。教育内容，一般都按市委宣传部所指定的“共产党员标准八项问题”以及“党的基础知识”等材料为基础，同时注意结合各支部党员当前的主要思想状况和各厂矿生产上存在的突出问题。一九五四年，受过这种训练的新党员就有七千多名。经过训练的新党员的政治觉悟和思想水平都大大提高。五金二分厂党员孙永革同志，在学习以前，只顾干好个人的活；学习后，明确了必须依靠群众，并带领群众搞好生产的道理。因此，当该厂给别的厂加工电灯坐子，遇到困难时，他就积极地同全组工人研究。他们采用多刀多刃方法，使产量提高一倍半，质量百分之百的合乎规格，并保证了加工任务如期完成。　（管）
