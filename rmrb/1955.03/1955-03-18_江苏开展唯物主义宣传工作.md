In order to promote materialist thought among cadres and intellectuals throughout the province and criticize bourgeois idealist thought, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to first carry out propaganda work in provincial-level organs and Nanjing, and then gradually expand to Wuxi, Suzhou, Xuzhou, Changzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou, as well as the entire province. A general lecture group has been formed, consisting of fifteen people including Yu Minghuang, Xu Jin, Liu Zijian, and Nie Qikun. The general lecture group plans to deliver sixteen lectures on specific topics within this year, systematically carrying out propaganda and education on the Marxist-Leninist materialist worldview. The first lecture, entitled "Why it is Necessary to Criticize Bourgeois Idealism and Study and Propagate the Materialist Worldview," began on March 16th and was given by Liu Shunyuan.
