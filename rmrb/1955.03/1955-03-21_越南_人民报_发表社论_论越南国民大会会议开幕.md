Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on March 20th, commenting on the opening of the fourth session of the Vietnam National Assembly. The title of the editorial is: "This National Assembly Will Lay the Foundation for New Victories of Our Nation."

The editorial said that the Vietnam National Assembly has made great contributions to the revolutionary cause of the nation, and it is deservedly the state organ with the highest power.

The editorial continued: This session of the National Assembly is being held after the long-term resistance war has achieved victory, peace has been restored but not yet consolidated, and the independence and unification of our country have not yet been completed. We strictly fulfill the Geneva Accords, but the U.S. imperialism, the French colonialists who are undermining the agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are plotting to divide our country for a long time. Imperialist warmongers are plotting to turn South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into their military bases in order to prepare to re-ignite the war in Indochina. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are stepping up preparations for a new war; but at the same time, the world's forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are unprecedentedly strong.

The editorial emphasized: Under such complex circumstances, the holding of the fourth session of the National Assembly is of extremely important significance. The National Assembly will discuss and adopt measures to continue to implement the Geneva Accords, so as to consolidate peace, realize unification, and complete independence and democracy. The National Assembly will also discuss and adopt necessary policies and measures to consolidate the victory of the revolution and advance this victory. The National Assembly will discuss and adopt important measures such as completing land reform, restoring the economy, and consolidating national defense forces, so as to consolidate the northern half and improve the people's lives. At present, the struggle to thoroughly implement the armistice agreement and consolidate the northern half is the most important task, and land reform is the most important task in consolidating the northern half. The consolidation of the northern half lays a solid foundation for consolidating peace, realizing unification, and completing independence and democracy.

The editorial pointed out that this session of the National Assembly will demonstrate the great strength of the Vietnamese people against all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, the French colonialists who are undermining the agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and will strengthen the unbreakable unity of the more than 20 million Vietnamese people in resolutely safeguarding and developing the victories they have achieved, building a peaceful and happy life, and completing the unfinished tasks of the people's democratic revolution. A heroic nation that has waged a resolute and tenacious struggle against enemies at home and abroad is bound to achieve independence and unification. This session of the National Assembly will once again show the steel-like will of the Vietnamese nation.

The editorial concluded: Our people across the country resolutely support the National Assembly and believe that the fourth session of the National Assembly will be a complete success.

    越南“人民报”发表社论
    论越南国民大会会议开幕
    【新华社河内二十日电】越南“人民报”二十日发表社论，评论越南国民大会第四次会议开幕。社论的题目是：“这一次国民大会将为我们民族的新胜利打下基础”。
    社论说，越南国民大会对民族的革命事业有巨大的功勋，它当之无愧地是具有最高权力的国家机关。
    社论接着说：国民大会这一次会议是在长期抗战已经取得胜利之后、和平已经恢复但还没有巩固、我国的独立统一还没有完成的情况下举行的。我们严格地履行日内瓦协定，但是美帝国主义、破坏协定的法国殖民者和吴庭艳集团却阴谋长期分割我国。帝国主义好战分子正在阴谋把南越、柬埔寨和老挝变成他们的军事基地，以准备重新挑起印度支那的战争。美帝国主义和它的仆从正在加紧准备新的战争；但同时世界和平民主和社会主义力量正是空前强大的时候。
    社论着重指出：在这样复杂的情况下国民大会举行第四次会议是具有极为重要的意义的。国民大会将讨论并通过继续履行日内瓦协定的措施，借以巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主。国民大会又将讨论和通过必要的政策和措施，以巩固革命的胜利和推进这一胜利。国民大会将讨论和通过完成土地改革、恢复经济、巩固国防力量等重要措施，以巩固北半部和改善人民的生活。目前，彻底执行停战协定和巩固北半部的斗争是头等重要的工作，而土地改革又是巩固北半部的头等重要工作。北半部得到巩固，就是为巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主打下了稳固的基础。
    社论指出，国民大会这一次会议将显示越南全国人民反对美帝国主义、破坏协定的法国殖民者和吴庭艳集团的一切阴谋的伟大力量，并且将加强越南两千多万人民坚决维护和发展已经取得的胜利、建设和平幸福生活、完成人民民主革命还没有完成的任务的不可摧毁的团结一致。曾经同国内外敌人进行坚决顽强斗争的一个英勇民族，是一定要获得独立和统一的。国民大会这一次会议将再一次表明越南民族的这种钢铁般的意志。
    社论最后说：我们全国人民坚决拥护国民大会，并且相信国民大会第四次会议一定完全成功。
