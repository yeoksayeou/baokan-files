    The American aggressor bloc has forced the French Senate to approve the Paris Agreements on March 27. Following the decision of the French Senate, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and other countries have stated that they will also complete the ratification process for the Paris Agreements in the near future. The ratification of these agreements is a signal for the rearmament of West Germany and the revival of German militarism. The German Wehrmacht, which twice launched world wars, slaughtered millions of people in Europe, and destroyed countless families, properties, cities, and villages, is now, according to the will of the United States, about to reappear in Europe. It is conceivable how the peace and security of the people of Europe and the world are facing an increasingly serious threat.
    The French Senate's approval of the Paris Agreements is a complete violation of the will of the French people. The firm will of the French people against the Paris Agreements has been expressed in the rising national patriotic movement. Across France, 4.5 million people have signed petitions opposing the rearmament of West Germany. Thanks to the unity and efforts of French patriotic forces, the movement against the Paris Agreements is constantly expanding, with more and more political figures, including more than 20,000 city councilors, more than 3,000 mayors, and more than 400 provincial councilors, joining the movement. During the Senate debates, hundreds of delegations from various regions regularly went to the Luxembourg Palace to demand the rejection of the Paris Agreements; workers in some enterprises even went on strike to protest the attempt to force France to accept the Paris Agreements. Every patriotic Frenchman believes that handing weapons to the historical enemy of France—German militarists—is a serious crime that endangers the interests of the French nation.
    The American aggressor bloc and its followers believed that the French Senate's debate was the last hurdle in their march towards implementing the arming of West Germany, and therefore they used every means to put pressure on the French Senate. U.S. President Eisenhower reiterated the notorious seven "guarantees," spread the smokescreen of a "great power conference" to confuse public opinion; British Prime Minister Churchill threatened that if France did not ratify the Paris Agreements, it would face "international isolation"; and West Germany's Adenauer did not hesitate to make cheap promises to deceive people, such as "adhering to the provisions and spirit of the Saar Agreement." Particularly shameless was that Washington and London actually used military orders as a means of enticing and threatening France. They said: If the Paris Agreements are approved, military orders to France will be increased; otherwise, these orders will be stopped, and the supply of non-ferrous metals and oil will be canceled, and import restrictions on French goods will be strengthened. This insulting approach by the U.S.-British bloc towards France is unprecedented in the history of international relations. French Senator Romani angrily denounced that the U.S.-British bloc "has priced France's position too cheaply."
    In order to act in accordance with the will of the United States, the French government used all means to force the French Senate to approve the Paris Agreements. French Foreign Minister Pinay actually said in the Senate that rejecting the Paris Agreements would lead France to a fate of "either hopeless enslavement or liberation in ruins"; French Prime Minister Faure tried his best to conceal the danger of the revival of German militarism, saying that compared with the "guaranteed" Paris Agreements, "France gave Hitler much more." This cannot help but remind people of the example of how the criminals of French history, such as Bonnet, Flandin, and Laval, dragged France step by step under the iron heel of Hitler's Wehrmacht before World War II.
    The approval and implementation of the Paris Agreements will inevitably further deteriorate the situation in Europe and greatly increase the danger of war. The American aggressor bloc has already announced that it will rapidly equip West Germany's aggressive forces with all kinds of new weapons, including atomic weapons. At the same time, the establishment of a Western European military alliance with a revived militaristic West Germany at its core will deepen the division of Europe and lead to an arms race among the countries. It is particularly noteworthy that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will increase its aggressiveness due to the participation of West Germany. In fact, this group has long made no secret of building its war preparation plans on the basis of using atomic weapons and using West Germany's Wehrmacht to implement a "forward strategy." In this way, Europe will be shrouded in the threat of atomic war.
    However, if the American bloc believes that the approval and implementation of the Paris Agreements can strengthen their "position of strength" against peaceful and democratic countries, it is completely wishful thinking. The situation in Germany and Europe today is completely different from that before World War II. Now, in Eastern Germany, the German Democratic Republic has been established, standing firmly with the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe. Furthermore, the American aggressor bloc thinks that it can arbitrarily drive the people of Western European countries, especially the French people, to fight alongside their former enemy—German militarists—in a war against the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries in Europe. They are counting their chickens before they hatch. French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez recently reiterated the determination of the French people never to allow themselves to be drawn into an anti-Soviet war. The U.S. plan to instigate a new war in Europe will surely be met with even more resolute opposition from the peace-loving people of all European countries.
    What is particularly important is that the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe will not allow themselves to be caught off guard in the face of the threat of war. The eight governments participating in the Moscow Conference have reached complete agreement on measures to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation and to organize a joint command of the contracting states. Once the Paris Agreements are finally approved and implemented, the united defense force of the Soviet Union and the peace-loving countries of Europe, as solid as a wall of bronze and iron, will be established. This force is powerful and invincible, and it will also receive the full support of 600 million Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world. If the imperialist aggressor bloc dares to launch a war, it will inevitably suffer a devastating blow.
    The French people and the people of other Western European countries will not accept the fait accompli of the revival of German militarism. The approval of the Paris Agreements does not mean the end of the French people's and the European people's struggle to defend peace; on the contrary, it will only prompt them to more resolutely and diligently grasp the cause of defending peace in their own hands. This just struggle of theirs will continue to receive the full support of the peace-loving people of the world.

    斗争一定会继续下去
    谭文瑞
    美国侵略集团已经迫使法国参议院于三月二十七日批准了巴黎协定。在法国参议院做出这个决定之后，比利时、荷兰、卢森堡等国的政府当局都表示，它们也将在短期内完成批准巴黎协定的手续。这个协定的批准就是重新武装西德、复活德国军国主义的信号。两次发动世界大战，在欧洲屠杀了千百万人民，毁灭了数不清的家庭、财产、城市和乡村的德国国防军，现在要按照美国意旨，重新在欧洲出现了。可想而知，欧洲和世界人民的和平和安全遭受着怎样日益严重的威胁。
    法国参议院批准巴黎协定，是完全违反法国人民的意志的。法国人民反对巴黎协定的坚决意志，已在日益高涨的全国性爱国运动中表示出来。在法国各地已有四百五十万人在反对重新武装西德的请愿书上签了名。由于法国爱国力量的团结和努力，反对巴黎协定的运动在不断地扩大，越来越多的政界人士，包括两万多名市议员，三千多名市长和四百多名省议员都参加了这个运动。在参议院进行辩论的期间，经常有数以百计的各地人民的代表团到卢森堡宫要求否决巴黎协定；一些企业的工人并举行了罢工来抗议强迫法国接受巴黎协定的企图。每一个爱国的法国人都认为，把武器交给法国的世仇——德国军国主义者的手中是一桩危害法国民族利益的严重罪行。
    美国侵略集团及其追随者认为法国参议院的辩论是它们走向实施武装西德的最后一个难关，因而它们曾使尽了一切手段来对法国参议院施加压力。美国总统艾森豪威尔重申臭名昭著的七项“保证”，散布“大国会议”的烟幕来迷惑舆论；英国首相邱吉尔则以法国不批准巴黎协定就要遭到“国际上的孤立”实行恫吓；西德的阿登纳也不惜作出“恪守萨尔协定的条文和精神”的廉价诺言来骗人。特别无耻的是，华盛顿和伦敦竟以军事订货作为对法国施行诱骗和威胁的手段。它们说：如果巴黎协定被批准，就将增加对法国的军事订货；否则就要停止这些订货，并且取消有色金属和石油的供应以及加强对法国货物的入口限制。美英集团对法国的这种侮辱性的做法，在国际关系史上是空前的。法国参议员罗马尼就愤慨地斥责说，美英集团“把法国的地位定价定得太贱了”。
    为了按照美国的意志办事，法国政府用一切手段来逼使法国参议院批准巴黎协定。法国外长比内在参议院中居然说，拒绝巴黎协定就会使法国的命运“不是无望的奴役就是在废墟中得到解放”；法国总理富尔更极力掩饰复活德国军国主义的危险，他说和有“保证”的巴黎协定比较起来，“法国给希特勒的要多得多”。这不能不使人想到，庞纳、佛兰亭、赖伐尔这些法国历史的罪人在第二次世界大战以前，怎样一步一步地把法国拖到希特勒国防军的铁蹄下面的前例。
    巴黎协定的批准和实施，必然要使欧洲局势进一步恶化，并且使战争的危险大大增加起来。美国侵略集团早已宣布将以包括原子武器在内的各种新式武器迅速装备西德的侵略部队。同时，以复活了军国主义的西德为核心的西欧军事联盟的建立，将加深欧洲的分裂，导致各国的军备竞赛。特别值得注意的是，北大西洋集团将由于西德的参加而增加它的侵略性。事实上这个集团早就毫不隐讳要把准备战争的计划建立在使用原子武器的基础之上，并且要利用西德的国防军来执行“前进战略”。这样，欧洲就要被笼罩在原子战争的威胁之中。
    但是，如果美国集团认为巴黎协定的批准和实施，就可以加强它们对和平民主国家的“实力”地位，那完全是妄想。今天德国的情况和欧洲的情况和第二次世界大战以前完全不同了。现在，在东部德国已建立起一个同苏联以及欧洲其他爱好和平国家坚定地站在一起的德意志民主共和国。并且，美国侵略集团认为可以随意驱使西欧各国人民，首先是法国的人民同他们昔日的仇人——德国军国主义者在反对苏联和欧洲爱好和平国家的战争中作战，它的算盘也是打得太容易了。法国共产党总书记多列士最近就重申了法国人民绝不会让自己卷入一场反苏战争的决心。美国在欧洲策动新战争的计划，一定要受到欧洲各国爱好和平人民更加坚决的反对。
    尤其重要的是，苏联和其他欧洲爱好和平的国家决不会让自己在战争威胁面前措手不及。参加莫斯科会议的八国政府已就缔结友好合作条约和组织缔约国家联合司令部的措施，取得了完全一致的意见。一旦巴黎协定最后批准并付诸实施，坚如铜墙铁壁的苏联和欧洲爱好和平国家的联合防御力量就将建立起来。这种力量是强大无敌的，并且它还将得到六万万中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的全力支持。帝国主义侵略集团如果敢于发动战争，就必然要遭受到毁灭性的打击。
    法国人民和其他西欧各国人民是不会接受复活德国军国主义的既成事实的。批准巴黎协定绝不意味着法国人民和欧洲人民保卫和平的斗争的终止；相反地，它只会促使他们更加坚决、更加努力地把保卫和平的事业紧紧掌握在自己手中。他们的这一正义斗争，将继续获得全世界爱好和平人民的全力支持。
