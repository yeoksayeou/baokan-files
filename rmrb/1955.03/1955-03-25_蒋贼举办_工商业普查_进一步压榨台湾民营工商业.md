Xinhua News Agency, March 24th:

    Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, in order to further squeeze and plunder private industry and commerce in Taiwan, has launched a large-scale so-called "industrial and commercial census" since March 1st, dispatching a large number of police and officials.
    Taiwan newspapers report that since March 1st, the Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan Provincial Government has sent more than 2,000 so-called "investigators" and "supervisors," with the cooperation of tens of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's police, divided into many "investigation teams," barging into private factories, mines, and shops in Taiwan's urban and rural areas to conduct a so-called "census" from house to house. Chiang Kai-shek also announced the "Standards for Industrial and Commercial Operators Refusing Investigation and Making False Declarations," which stipulated that if Taiwan's private industrial and commercial operators do not fill out the forms according to the figures designated by Chiang Kai-shek's investigators and police personnel regarding production quantity and value, capital and assets, business income, etc., they will be subject to "severe punishment." Chiang Kai-shek's investigators and police are taking this opportunity to extort and blackmail private industrial and commercial operators during the investigation.
    Yan Jiagan, Chairman of Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan Province, once openly admitted the criminal purpose of holding the "industrial and commercial census." In his so-called "Letter to Industrial and Commercial Circles of the Entire Province" published on February 2nd, he admitted: "Speaking of the industrial and commercial census, it can be said to be a basic national situation survey." This proves that Chiang Kai-shek's "industrial and commercial census" is inheriting the mantle of the "national situation survey" conducted by the Japanese occupiers in Taiwan in 1939. At that time, after completing the "national situation survey," the Japanese occupiers forced a large number of private industrial and commercial operators in Taiwan to shut down, and strengthened material control, using the pretext of "cooperating with the wartime economy" to begin a large-scale plunder of Taiwan's industrial and commercial households.
    In recent years, Taiwan's private industry and commerce have suffered tremendous damage under the heavy tax squeeze and bureaucratic capital exclusion of Chiang Kai-shek's clique. In 1954 alone, one-third of the private weaving mills closed down, and those that did not close were mostly in a state of semi-shutdown. In just one month, from mid-November to mid-December 1954, one thousand shops closed down in Taiwan. Even Taiwan newspapers openly admitted that the current situation of Taiwan's private industry and commerce is that "small and medium-sized factories mostly have reduced production, suspended work, and closed down, while shops are bleak."
    The "industrial and commercial census" held by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and resistance from Taiwan's private industrial and commercial operators. Taiwan newspapers revealed that many industrial and commercial households have delayed or deliberately destroyed the survey forms sent by Chiang Kai-shek's investigation teams, and tried their best to evade the investigation by Chiang Kai-shek's personnel, adding many difficulties to Chiang Kai-shek's "census" work. Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan Provincial Government recently threatened Taiwan's private industrial and commercial operators again: if industrial and commercial operators cause the "census" work to be "obstructed," they will be "dealt with according to the law without mercy." Some private industrial and commercial operators have been designated as "obstructing the census offenders" and imprisoned.

### 蒋贼举办“工商业普查”  进一步压榨台湾民营工商业

    蒋贼举办“工商业普查”
    进一步压榨台湾民营工商业
   【新华社二十四日讯】蒋介石卖国集团为了进一步压榨和掠夺台湾民营工商业，自三月一日开始，出动大批警察、官吏进行规模浩大的所谓“工商业普查”。
    台湾报纸报道，蒋贼台湾省政府自三月一日开始派出了两千多名所谓“调查员”和“监查员”，在数以万计的蒋贼警察配合下，分成许多“调查小组”，闯入台湾城乡各民营工厂、矿场和商店挨家逐户地进行所谓“普查”。蒋贼并公布了“工商业者拒绝调查及虚伪申报之标准”，其中规定，凡是有关生产数量和价值、资本和资产、营业收入等项，台湾民营工商业者如果不依照蒋贼调查人员和警察人员指定的数字填写表格，就要受到“严厉惩处”。蒋贼调查人员和警察正借此在调查中向民营工商业者大肆敲诈勒索。
    蒋贼台湾省主席严家淦曾公开承认举办“工商业普查”的罪恶目的。他在二月二日发表所谓“告全省工商界人士书”中承认：“谈到工商业普查，可以说是一种基本的国势调查。”这就是证明了蒋贼的“工商业普查”是继承一九三九年日本占领者在台湾举行的“国势调查”的衣钵。当时，日本占领者在完成“国势调查”后，曾迫令台湾大批民营工商业者停业，并加强物资统制，借“配合战时经济”为名，开始对台湾工商业户的大掠夺。
    几年来，台湾民营工商业在蒋贼重税压榨和官僚资本排挤下，已经遭受到极大摧残。在一九五四年内，民营织布厂倒闭了三分之一，未倒闭的也大都陷于半停工状态。单只在一九五四年十一月中旬到十二月中旬的一个月内，台湾倒闭的商店就有一千家。连台湾报纸也公开承认，目前台湾民营工商业的情况是“中小的工厂多有减产、停工、倒闭，商店则萧条不堪”。
    蒋介石卖国集团所举行的“工商业普查”，已经引起台湾民营工商业者越来越多的不满和抗拒。台湾报纸透露，许多工商业户对蒋贼调查小组发来的调查表格，拖延不理或故意毁失，并尽量设法逃避蒋贼人员的调查，给蒋贼的“普查”工作增加许多困难。蒋贼台湾省政府最近又向台湾民营工商业者恫吓：如工商业者使“普查”工作“遭受阻碍”，将“毫不容情的依法处理”。有些民营工商业者，已被指为“阻碍普查犯”，关进监狱。
