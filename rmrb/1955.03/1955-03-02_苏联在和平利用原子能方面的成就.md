Soviet Achievements in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
Wang Ganchang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Humanity has long dreamed of understanding and changing atoms, but realizing this dream has been possible only through the continuous efforts of many scientists over a long period of time. With Lomonosov, the atom first became the basis of science; with Mendeleev, the periodic law of the elements constituting all matter was discovered. However, understanding the interior of the atom and the depths of the atomic nucleus is a relatively recent development in the last half-century. Sixteen years ago, scientists obtained the scientific principles for utilizing atomic energy, and people were hoping to use these principles to release the enormous energy stored in atomic nuclei to benefit humanity. However, American imperialists are carrying out atomic blackmail throughout the world, attempting to provoke another world war and plotting to push humanity into disaster and death. In such times, the Soviet government and people have set a brilliant example by using every scientific achievement to benefit humanity, especially in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, opening a new era in human history.

As early as 1929, Academician Skobeltsyn of the Soviet Academy of Sciences first used an instrument to make the orbits of high-speed electrons circular, thereby accurately measuring their momentum. This method, commonly known as the Skobeltsyn method, is now a widely used and effective method in nuclear physics and cosmic ray research. Relying on this method, many people have obtained very important results. The discovery of the positron is one example.

In early 1932, shortly after the discovery of the neutron, Soviet physicist Ivanenko believed that the neutron, a particle with no charge and a mass close to that of the proton, existed within the atomic nucleus; he also believed that the components of the atomic nucleus were protons and neutrons. Thanks to Ivanenko's suggestion, physicists gained a correct understanding of the internal structure of the atomic nucleus, and on this basis, they could accurately analyze the results of various atomic nucleus experiments, thereby enabling this discipline to advance rapidly to its current stage of development.

In 1934, under the guidance of the late Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Cherenkov, through continuous research, proved that secondary rays can cause liquids to emit light when passing through them. Soviet theoretical physicists Frank and Tamm further clarified this phenomenon theoretically, proposing the necessary conditions for luminescence and deducing various properties of this light. This phenomenon is called the Cherenkov effect. Currently, the instrument that uses the Cherenkov effect to detect high-speed charged particles, the Cherenkov counter tube, has become an almost indispensable tool in high-energy nuclear physics research.

In 1944, Soviet physicist Veksler invented the synchrophasotron and synchrocyclotron, solving the problem of the continuous increase in the kinetic energy of charged particles. Currently, these instruments can increase the kinetic energy of protons to billions of electron volts. Using such high-energy protons to bombard matter can produce mesons and hyperons, and can also be used for other experiments, playing a very important role in studying the most fundamental physical problems of the present day, namely the problem of elementary particles. It can be predicted that Veksler's invention will play an even greater role in future research on the most fundamental physical problems than it does now.

In the study of uranium fission, Soviet scholars Petrzhak and Flerov accurately measured the half-life of spontaneous fission of uranium nuclei. Frenkel made creative contributions to the theory of uranium fission mechanisms.

In the study of cosmic rays (a discipline closely related to nuclear physics), Academician Skobeltsyn observed electron cascade showers in cosmic rays as early as 1929 to 1931, while the Englishman Blackett and others did not observe these showers until 1933. Soviet theoretical physicists Landau, Tamm, and Belenky have done much valuable work on the theory of electron showers.

Soviet scholars have made many contributions to nuclear physics; the above are just a few examples. We know that under the current circumstances, the development of nuclear physics research is inseparable from mastering the methods and techniques of applying atomic energy, and the two are mutually reinforcing. Today, the Soviet Union has successfully completed the generation of electricity from atomic energy, which shows that the Soviet Union has reached a higher level in both the theoretical research and technology of nuclear physics.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy are unprecedented. Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: "From theoretical exploration and experimental research, the possibility in principle of utilizing atomic energy was proven when the Patriotic War had just begun." At that time, many industrial areas of the Soviet Union fell into enemy hands, and Soviet scientists and engineers were engaged in the study of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy under difficult conditions. Shortly after the end of the Patriotic War, in 1947, they mastered the secrets of atomic energy. In August 1953, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Malenkov, announced that the United States was no longer a monopolist in the production of hydrogen bombs. On July 1, 1954, the Soviet Union announced that an atomic power plant with a capacity of 5,000 kilowatts had begun transmitting electricity. The United States, on the other hand, has not even begun to build a power plant of this scale. People understand that using atomic energy to generate electricity is technically much more difficult than an atomic pile that only produces neutrons, radioactive isotopes, or fissile materials (raw materials for making atomic bombs). To enable the generator to achieve higher efficiency, the atomic pile must operate at high temperatures of 500, 600, or even 700 degrees Celsius. Therefore, heat-resistant alloys have become a serious difficult problem. The erosion of neutrons and other radiation is also a very difficult problem to solve. We also know that various chemical reactions are particularly strong at high temperatures, and general materials are difficult to withstand the impact of a large number of neutrons and radiation in the atomic pile, and they are also not easily immune to the erosion of chemical reactions at high temperatures. Selecting liquids or gases that conduct heat well but do not absorb neutrons is also a difficult problem. Ordinary materials are difficult to meet these requirements. However, Soviet scientists have overcome these many difficulties and successfully completed all the work of the atomic power plant. And they are in the process of building an atomic power plant with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. Although American imperialism uses hydrogen bombs to intimidate the people of the world, according to Foreign Minister Molotov's recent report, the Soviet Union has such achievements in this regard that it is no longer the Soviet Union but the United States of America that is lagging behind. These facts fully demonstrate that the science and technology of the Soviet Union in the application of atomic energy are progressing very rapidly, and the current level far exceeds that of the United States.

Another important component of the peaceful use of atomic energy is the application of isotopes. In atomic piles, nuclear reactions result in the production of many isotopes, and neutrons produced in atomic piles can also be used to create various isotopes. These isotopes are very useful because isotopes of the same element have the same chemical properties, but their nuclear properties, such as radioactivity and mass, are different. Because of these differences, we can use modern physical methods to distinguish atoms of this element, or use simpler methods to track the movement of these atoms. For example, if we want to know how table salt circulates in our body, we only need to eat table salt made of radioactive sodium, and then use a counter to observe from outside the body, we can know how it circulates and how it is excreted from the kidneys. This is the research method commonly referred to as "labeled atoms" or "tracers." The advantage of this new method is not only its simplicity, but it can also enable us to solve problems that were previously difficult or impossible to solve experimentally, and it sometimes allows us to obtain unexpected results.

Now science has developed to the point where mankind has been able to grasp the laws inside the atomic nucleus, and we must consider and utilize these laws in our handling of various sciences, technologies, and even production problems (all of which are based on elements, that is, atoms). Therefore, the application of isotopes is actually an aspect of the progress of other sciences and technologies driven by the achievements of nuclear physics.

The Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the application of isotopes. They promote this method in various ways. They now widely use this method in research in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and medicine, as well as in production departments or technical departments, and have achieved many important results. For example, they use radioactive cobalt to inspect damage to machine parts; measure the level of molten iron in blast furnaces and the damage to blast furnaces. For example, they use the radioactivity of isotopes to create effective methods for automatic control and management technology, and create many special instruments used in the metallurgical, paper, and rubber industries. Soviet scholars have used radioactive phosphorus to study the physiological processes of plants, discovered the laws of plant roots and leaves absorbing and transporting nutrients, thereby enabling us to know how to properly fertilize and control other conditions to increase crop yields. In 1952, Uzbekistan, the main cotton-producing area of the Soviet Union, used this method to increase cotton production by 12 percent.

Photosynthesis is a very important but also very complex problem. Scientists have long known that plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and use sunlight and chlorophyll to synthesize organic matter such as carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. This is a basic process that countless farmers expect from crops throughout the year, and it is also a basic process that we expect from forests. In other words, this is the fundamental manufacturing process of all our food, all our agricultural products, timber, etc. How significant it would be if we could understand it! Soviet scholars have used radioactive carbon to discover the initial products of carbon dioxide fixation in plant leaves, and understood some of the reaction essentials of plant roots absorbing carbon dioxide... Although this problem has not been completely solved, the use of isotopes has greatly advanced the study of photosynthesis. Success in this area (even if only partial achievement) will surely bring happiness to mankind.

Soviet geologists use isotopes to determine the absolute age of rocks and minerals, determine that the Earth did not have a solid crust 5 billion years ago, and determine the timing of more recent events.... Chemists use isotopes to study dynamics and reaction performance.... Physiologists use isotopes to study Pavlovian theory....

We should also mention the application of neutrons. Neutrons can also be regarded as the No. 0 element. In addition to reacting with fissionable materials to produce atomic energy and interacting with general elements to create isotopes, Soviet scholars also widely use it to study molecular structure; use it for chemical analysis; use it for mineral exploration, etc. The utilization of neutrons is also a very meaningful topic for scientists.

Although the Soviet Union has made many significant achievements in the application of isotopes, they believe that this is just the beginning. Soviet scholars' research in isotopes forms a strong contrast with capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, the use of isotopes depends only on the interests of a few scientists, and the supply of isotopes is also greatly restricted. This clearly shows who is truly for the high development of science and culture and for the prosperity and progress of mankind.

Using atomic explosions to excavate canals, using atomic energy to develop power, using isotopes to reform production, promote the further development of various sciences and technologies, and create more wealth for the people - this is the Soviet path, and it is the path of human progress. However, a small handful of atomic maniacs in American imperialism are clamoring to use atomic bombs to slaughter mankind.

The Soviet Union's friendly assistance to our country and other people's democratic countries in the development of atomic energy is a great encouragement to us. We believe that with the direct help of the Soviet Union, we will surely be able to master atomic energy quickly.

    苏联在和平利用原子能方面的成就
    中国科学院物理研究所副所长  王淦昌
    人类很早就有了解原子和改变原子的梦想，但是实现这个梦想是经过很多科学家的不断努力，经过漫长的年代才逐步成为可能的。到罗蒙诺索夫，原子第一次成为科学的基础；至门捷列也夫，发现了构成一切物质的元素的周期律；而对原子内部和原子核深处的了解还是最近半个世纪的事。十六年前科学家们已经得到了关于利用原子能的科学原理，人们正希望根据这些原理来释放原子核中蕴藏着的巨大的能来造福人类，但是美帝国主义者却在全世界进行原子讹诈，企图挑起另一次世界大战，妄想把人类推向灾难和死亡的深渊。在这样的时代里，苏联政府和人民把科学的每一个成就都用来造福人类，特别是在原子能的和平利用上创造了光辉的榜样，在人类历史上开辟了一个崭新的纪元。
    早在一九二九年，苏联科学院斯科贝尔琴院士首先用一种仪器使高速电子的轨道成为圆形，从而很准确地测出它的冲量。这个方法，通常被称为斯科贝尔琴法，现在它是原子核物理和宇宙线研究中一个广泛应用着的有效方法。依靠了这个方法，许多人得出了很重要的结果。正电子的发现，就是一个例子。
    一九三二年初，中子发现后不久，苏联物理学家伊凡宁科就认为中子这个不带电而质量很近于质子的粒子，是存在于原子核内的；他并且认为，原子核的组成部分是质子和中子。由于伊凡宁科的这个提示，使物理学家对于原子核的内部构造有了正确的认识，并且在此基础上，可以很准确地分析各种原子核实验的结果，从而使这门学科很迅速地向前进展，达到了今日的发展阶段。
    一九三四年，切仑科夫在已故苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫的指点下，经不断钻研，证明第二射线通过液体时能使液体发光。苏联理论物理学家弗伦克和塔姆，更从理论上把这个现象加以阐明，提出发光的必要条件和推论出这种光的各种性质。人们管这种现象叫作切仑科夫效应。目前利用切仑科夫效应来探测高速带电粒子的仪器，即切仑科夫计数管，已经成为高能原子核物理研究中几乎不可缺少的工具了。
    一九四四年苏联物理学家维克斯勒发明了同步加速器和同步回旋加速器，解决了带电粒子的动能继续不断增加的问题。目前这些仪器已能使质子的动能增加到几十亿电子伏特。用这样高能的质子撞击物质，可以产生介子和重介子等，还可以作其他实验，对于研究当前最基本的物理问题，即基本粒子问题，起着十分重要的作用。可以预料，维克斯勒的发明对于将来研究最基本的物理问题，会起比现在更为重大的作用。
    在铀原子核分裂的研究方面，苏联学者彼得沙克和弗利洛夫准确地测定了铀原子核天然分裂的半蜕期。弗伦克尔则在铀分裂机构的理论方面有创造性的贡献。
    在宇宙射线（同原子核物理有很密切关系的一门学科）的研究方面。斯科贝尔琴院士早在一九二九年到一九三一年内就观察到宇宙射线中的电子级联簇射，而英国人勃勒克等直到一九三三年才观察到这种簇射。关于电子簇射的理论，苏联理论物理学家朗道、塔姆和贝伦基曾做了不少很有贡献的工作。
    苏联学者在原子核物理上的贡献是很多的，上面所说的只是几个例子而已。我们知道，在目前情况之下，原子核物理研究工作的开展，是和掌握应用原子能的方法、技术分不开的，二者是相辅并进的。今天，苏联已经胜利地完成了原子能的发电，这说明苏联在原子核物理的学理研究上或技术上都已达到了更高的水平。
    正如大家所知道的，苏联在和平利用原子能方面的成就是史无前例的。苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫说过：“从理论的探索与实验的研究，在卫国战争才开始时就证明了利用原子能的原则上的可能性。”在那时，苏联很多工业地区沦于敌手，苏联科学家们和工程师们在困难的条件下从事原子能和平利用问题的研究。卫国战争胜利结束后不久，于一九四七年内，就掌握了原子能的秘密，一九五三年八月，前苏联部长会议主席马林科夫宣布，美国在氢弹生产方面已不是垄断者了。一九五四年七月一日，苏联又宣布一个五千瓩的原子能电力站已经开始输送电力。而美国呢，连建立这样规模的发电站都还没有开始。人们懂得，使用原子能发电，比较一个只产生中子、放射性同位素或可分裂物质（可以做原子弹的原料）的原子堆，在技术上要困难得多。要使发电机能够得到较高的效率，就必须使原子堆在摄氏五百度以至六百度、七百度的高温下进行工作，因此，耐高温的合金就成为一个严重的困难问题。中子和其他放射线的侵蚀也是一个十分难于解决的问题。我们又知道，在高温下各种化学作用特别强，一般材料很难经得起原子堆中大量中子和放射线的打击，也不容易在高温下不受化学作用的侵蚀。选择善于导热又不善于吸收中子的液体或气体也是一个困难的问题。通常的材料是很难满足这些要求的。可是苏联的科学家已经克服了这许多困难，胜利完成了原子能电力站的全部工作。并且正在着手建立一个十万瓩电力的原子能电力站。美国帝国主义虽以氢弹来恫吓全世界人民，但苏联在这方面，根据莫洛托夫外长最近的报告，他们已有如此的成就，以致落后的已经不是苏联而是美利坚合众国了。这些事实充分说明，苏联在原子能应用方面的科学技术是进展非常迅速的，目前的水平已远超出于美国了。
    原子能和平利用的另一个重要组成部分就是同位素的应用。在原子堆中，核反应的结果产生了很多同位素，而且利用原子堆中所产生的中子又可以制造各种同位素。这些同位素都是很有用处的，因为同一元素的同位素，它们的化学性质是相同的，但是它们的原子核性质，如放射性、质量等是有差别的，由于有了这些差别，我们就可以利用近代物理的方法来区别这个元素的原子，或用比较简便的方法来追踪这些原子的运动。例如，如果我们要知道食盐在我们身体内是怎样循环的，只须食用放射性钠做成的食盐，再用一个计数器从身体外部来观测，就可以知道它怎样循环和怎样从肾脏排泄出去。这就是平常所谓“标记原子”或“示踪物”的研究方法。这个新方法的好处，不仅只是简便，它还可以使我们解决以前在实验上难于解决或不可能解决的问题，而且它有时使我们得到意想不到的结果。
    现在科学已经发展到这样的程度，就是人类已经能够掌握原子核内部的规律，我们对各门科学、各种技术以至于生产问题的处理（这些问题全是以元素，即原子为基础的），就必须考虑和利用这些规律。所以，同位素的应用实际上就是由于原子核物理的成就带动其他科学和技术向前发展的一个方面。
    苏联对于同位素的应用，一直是非常重视的。他们用各种方式来推广这个方法。他们在物理、化学、生物、地质、医学等研究中，在生产部门或技术部门中现在都广泛地采用这个方法，并且取得了许多重要的成果。例如他们利用放射性钴来检查机件的损伤；测量化铁炉中铁水水平和高炉的损坏情况。例如他们利用同位素的放射性创造了自动控制和管理技术的有效办法，创造了许多冶金、造纸、橡胶工业所使用的特别仪器。苏联学者利用放射性磷研究了植物的生理过程，发现了植物的根和叶部吸收养分和输送养分的规律，因而使我们知道怎样适当施肥和控制其他条件来提高农作物的产量。一九五二年苏联主要产棉区乌兹别克用这种方法提高棉产量百分之十二。
    光合作用是一个很重要，但又是很复杂的问题。科学家们很早就知道植物吸收空中的二氧化碳，利用太阳光和叶绿素，将二氧化碳及水合成碳水化合物等有机物。这是我们无数农民终年辛苦劳动所企待于农作物的一个基本过程，也是我们所企待于森林的一个基本过程，换句话说，这是我们一切食物，一切农产品、木材等的根本制造过程，如果我们能了解它，该有多大的意义呀！苏联学者利用放射性碳发现了植物叶中固定二氧化碳的最初产物，了解了植物根部吸收二氧化碳的一些反应本质……虽然这个问题还没有彻底解决，但利用同位素已经使光合作用的研究大大推进一步。这方面的成功（那怕是部分的成就），一定又将给人类带来幸福。
    苏联地质学家利用同位素来决定岩石和矿物的绝对年龄，确定了五十亿年前地球还没有固体的外壳，确定较近事件的时间……。化学家利用同位素来研究动力学和反应性能……。生理学家利用同位素来研究巴甫洛夫学说……。
    我们还应当提一下中子的应用。中子也可以视作第某号元素。中子除和分裂性物质反应产生原子能，和一般元素作用制造同位素外，苏联学者还广泛地利用它来研究分子结构；用它来做化学分析；用它来探矿等。中子的利用也是科学家面前很有意义的课题。
    苏联在同位素的应用上虽然取得了许多重大的成就，但他们认为这还不过是一个开始。苏联学者在同位素方面的研究，同资本主义国家成了强烈的对照。在资本主义国家里，使用同位素只凭少数科学家的兴趣，而且在同位素的供应上，也受到了很大的限制。这就很明显地说明：谁是真正为了科学文化的高度发展和为了人类的繁荣和进步。
    把原子爆炸用于开凿运河，把原子能用来发展动力，把同位素用来改革生产，促进各门科学和技术的进一步发展，为人民创造更多的财富，这就是苏联的道路，也就是人类进步的道路。而美帝国主义一小撮的原子狂者，却叫嚣着要用原子弹来屠杀人类。
    苏联对我国及其他人民民主国家在发展原子能上的友谊帮助，对我们是一个极大的鼓舞。我们相信，我们在苏联的直接帮助下，一定能迅速地掌握原子能。
