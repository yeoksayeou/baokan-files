Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 6th: According to a Deutsche Press Agency dispatch from Bonn on the 5th, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on the 4th regarding the letter to the German People from the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic.

The statement said: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party welcomes the proposal made by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to hold a referendum throughout Germany based on the "German Declaration." The statement pointed out that the representatives of the people of the German Democratic Republic made this proposal on behalf of all the German people. Due to the decision of the Federal Parliament on February 27th, our people are facing a national emergency.

The statement said: The referendum will show the world what path the Germans are willing to take—the path of peaceful reunification or the path of the Paris Agreements.

The statement deeply regrets the rejection by West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer of the proposal from the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. But it went on to point out that we believe that all Social Democrats, trade union workers, workers, farmers, and intellectuals will fully agree with this proposal.

The statement said: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party believes it is necessary to distribute the People's Chamber's letter to the German people and the statement by Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic to all families, factories, associations, and Germans, and to discuss them.

The statement concluded: Let us do everything we can so that the German people have the opportunity, by accepting the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, to decide the fate of the German nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: TASS reported from Berlin on the 5th: Deutsche Press Agency reported that the delegation from the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to Bonn visited the Bonn Federal Parliament on the 4th. The delegation consisted of Mayer (Socialist Unity Party of Germany), the president of Karl Marx University in Leipzig and a representative of the People's Chamber, and Wiesemüller (Christian Democratic Union), a representative of the People's Chamber.

On the instructions of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, they handed over the letter to the German People, unanimously adopted by the People's Chamber at its meeting on March 2nd, to the Presidium of the Federal Parliament.

Along with this appeal, a letter signed by the Chairman of the People's Chamber, Dieckmann, was also sent. This letter requested the Federal Parliament to inform the Presidium of the People's Chamber of its views on the People's Chamber's proposal for an immediate all-German referendum as soon as possible. On the same day, the two representatives handed many copies of the appeal directly to the secretariats of the parliamentary groups in the Federal Parliament.
