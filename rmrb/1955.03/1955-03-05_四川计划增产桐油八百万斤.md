    Sichuan Plans to Increase Tung Oil Production by 8 Million Jin
    Oil industry workers in Sichuan Province plan to increase tung oil production for the country by 8 million jin this year.
    Sichuan Province is a key tung seed producing area in the country. However, the oil extraction rate is very low, with a maximum of only 32 jin of oil produced per 100 jin of tung seeds, and as low as 19 jin, leaving a lot of oil in the pressed cake. To improve the oil extraction rate, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry, the Oils and Fats Company, and other units jointly held a provincial tung seed processing experience exchange meeting in mid-January to promote the Li Chuanjiang oil pressing method. Everyone decided to further increase the oil extraction rate by two to three jin on the current basis of 27 to 28 jin of oil per 100 jin of tung seeds. The province can then increase tung oil production by 8 million jin. After improving operations, the oil workshop of the second district supply and marketing cooperative in Yunyang County has increased the oil yield from the original 27 jin to 32 jin and 12 liang.

    四川计划增产桐油八百万斤
    四川省油脂工业职工今年计划为国家增产桐油八百万斤。
    四川省是全国桐籽的重点产区。但是，产油率却很低，每百斤桐籽最高才产油三十二斤，低的产油十九斤，许多油残留在已榨过的枯饼里。为提高产油率，四川省工业厅、油脂公司等单位曾于一月中旬联合召开了全省桐籽加工经验交流会，推广李川江榨油操作法，大家决定在现在每百斤桐籽产油二十七、八斤的基础上，再提高产油率两斤到三斤，全省便可增产桐油八百万斤。云阳县第二区供销合作社油房改进操作后，已由原来的二十七斤提高到三十二斤十二两。
