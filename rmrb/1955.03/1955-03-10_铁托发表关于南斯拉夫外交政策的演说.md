Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, March 8th: According to a report from the Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade: Yugoslav President Tito delivered a report on Yugoslav foreign policy at a joint session of the two houses of the National Assembly on the 7th.

    In his report, Tito first emphasized the threat of nuclear weapons to humanity. He advocated the destruction of all existing nuclear weapons and also advocated
  "using nuclear energy for peaceful industrial purposes to raise living standards and eradicate poverty and backwardness."

    Tito reiterated that Yugoslavia's foreign policy is one of "active coexistence." He said: "Peace is indivisible. The policy of active coexistence is to cooperate with all countries, regardless of their social structure and political system." He said that Yugoslavia opposes dividing the world into blocs and also opposes the arms race because experience has shown that "the arms race usually leads to war."

    Tito described Yugoslavia's diplomatic activities in 1954, saying that "great progress was made in normalizing relations" between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries in 1954. Tito said: This is a contribution to stabilizing peace in Europe and "helps to ease the general tension in the world."

    Tito said that Yugoslavia has also established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The two countries will soon exchange diplomatic representatives.

    In his report, Tito also mentioned Yugoslavia's relations with Western countries. He said that Yugoslavia must continue to pursue "a policy of friendship and cooperation with Western countries."

    铁托发表关于南斯拉夫外交政策的演说
    【新华社八日讯】据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托七日在国民议会两院联席会议上就南斯拉夫外交政策作了报告。
    铁托在报告中首先强调指出核子武器对人类的威胁。他主张销毁现有的一切核子武器，并且主张
  “把核子能用于和平工业用途，以提高生活水平和铲除贫困和落后现象。”
    铁托再度强调南斯拉夫的外交政策是“积极共处”的政策。他说：“和平是不可分割的。积极共处的政策就是同一切国家进行合作，不管其社会结构和政治制度的不同。”他说，南斯拉夫反对把世界分裂成集团，也反对军备竞赛，因为经验证明，“军备竞赛通常总导向战争”。
    铁托叙述了一九五四年南斯拉夫的外交活动，他说一九五四年在使南斯拉夫同苏联和其他东欧国家的“关系正常化方面取得了巨大进展”。铁托说：这是对稳定欧洲和平的一个贡献，也“有助于缓和世界普遍的紧张局势”。
    铁托说，南斯拉夫也同中华人民共和国建立了外交关系。两国不久即将互派外交代表。
    铁托在报告中同时说到南斯拉夫同西方国家的关系。他说南斯拉夫必须继续执行“同西方国家友好和合作的政策”。
