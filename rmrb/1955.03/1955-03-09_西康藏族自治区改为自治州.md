    Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region Changed to Autonomous Prefecture
    The First Session of the Second People's Representative Conference of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province was held in Kangding from March 2nd to 6th. Seventy-eight representatives from Tibetan, Han, Yi, and Hui ethnic groups attended the meeting.
    According to the provisions of the Constitution, the meeting decided to change the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province to the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Xikang Province and exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress on its behalf. Sangji Yexi (Tibetan) was elected as the Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, and Xia Ke Daodeng (Tibetan), Awang Jiacuo (Tibetan), Sana (Tibetan), Luo Ming (Han), Jiangyang Bomu (Tibetan), and Suo Renke Zeng (Tibetan) were elected as the six Deputy Governors. Tuden Queyin (Tibetan), Kongsa Yiduo (Tibetan), Fan Zhizhong (Han), Luo Hong Zela (Yi), and twenty others were elected as members of the People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture, and Ma Lin (Han) was elected as the President of the Intermediate People's Court of the Autonomous Prefecture.
    The meeting pointed out that the unity of nationalities has been further consolidated in the autonomous region over the past year. Through land reclamation and production in key areas such as Kangding and Qianning counties, the land problems of landless and land-deficient farmers have been basically solved, 521 households have been resettled, and the practice of slash-and-burn cultivation has been eliminated. In the pastoral areas of the eastern and northern parts of the autonomous region, as a result of treating epidemic diseases and preventive injections for more than 330,000 cattle, the mortality rate of livestock has been greatly reduced. Over the past year, the people's living standards in the autonomous region have improved. The income of farmers and herdsmen from selling local and special products in 1954 increased by more than double compared to 1953. In addition, new developments have been made in cultural, educational, health, and cadre training work.
    The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, resolutely opposing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," and liberating Taiwan.

    西康藏族自治区改为自治州
    西康省藏族自治区第二届人民代表会议第一次会议于三月二日到六日在康定举行。参加会议的有藏、汉、彝、回等民族代表七十八人。
    会议根据宪法规定，决定将西康省藏族自治区改为西康省藏族自治州，并代行人民代表大会职权，选出桑吉悦希（藏族）为自治州州长，夏克刀登（藏族）、阿旺嘉错（藏族）、萨纳（藏族）、罗铭（汉族）、降央伯姆（藏族）、所仁克增（藏族）等六人为副州长，土登却隐（藏族）、孔萨益多（藏族）、樊执中（汉族）、罗洪则拉（彝族）等二十人为自治州人民委员会委员，马林（汉族）为自治州中级人民法院院长。
    会议指出：自治区一年来进一步巩固了民族团结；经过开荒生产，在康定、乾宁等六县重点地区，基本上解决了无地缺地农民的土地问题，安置了五百二十一户居民，并消灭了刀耕火种现象；在自治区东部北部畜牧地区，为三十三万多头牛治疗疫病和预防注射的结果，大大减少了牲畜的死亡。一年来，自治区人民生活有了提高，一九五四年农牧民出售土产、特产的收入比一九五三年增加了一倍多。此外，文教卫生、培养干部工作也都有了新的发展。
    会议还一致通过了拥护周外长声明、坚决反对美蒋“共同防御条约”、解放台湾的决议。
