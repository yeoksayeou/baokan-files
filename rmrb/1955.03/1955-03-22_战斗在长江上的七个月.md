Seven Months of Fighting on the Yangtze River
Political Commissar of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Geological Team Wang Yongquan

    The geological drilling work for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been completed. From the start of work to the complete fulfillment of the exploration task, a total of more than eight months have passed. We have successfully completed the geological drilling of the river channel and the approach bridges on both banks of the bridge crossing line, completed a key step in the preparatory work for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and provided relatively complete and reliable technical design data for the future construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
    For more than eight months, we spent almost seven months on the turbulent and fast-flowing Yangtze River. On the Yangtze River, with unskilled technology, we explored the complex geological layers in the river channel, fought against the floods that had never appeared in Wuhan's hydrological records, and overcame the difficulties brought to our work by wind, waves, and ice and snow, and completed the arduous river channel drilling work ahead of schedule.
    According to past data and the results of current drilling, it is proven that the geological distribution and organization near the river channel of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crossing line are quite complex. There are many types of rocks here, and perhaps in the distant past, there was a great earthquake, so the current river channel was originally a collapsed area. Due to the pressure generated by the earthquake collapse, not only the continuity of the rock strata was destroyed, forming a complex geological layer with interlocking teeth; moreover, many rocks became very fragmented due to being subjected to high pressure. This complex geological situation caused us to encounter many unexpected difficulties in drilling technology, and this fragmented rock hindered us from obtaining the core that served as the basis for technical design.
    The water level of the Yangtze River is very deep, and the flow rate is very rapid. When the water level of the Yangtze River rises to its peak, the deepest part of the river channel is more than forty meters, and the flow rate reaches 3.5 meters per second. This means that we must drill through deep water with a very rapid flow rate. Our management cadres, geologists, and experienced old workers are very unfamiliar with large-scale drilling in such deep water; no one has experienced such work. What's more, in our work, we often have to endure the threat of constantly rising floods and the impact of sudden climate changes on us!
    All these difficulties have affected our work, but we have not been intimidated by these difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party, with the selfless help and guidance of Soviet experts, and thanks to the efforts of all comrades, one difficulty after another was overcome by us.
    In the days and nights on the Yangtze River, in those arduous and difficult battles, first of all, we cannot forget the enthusiastic help of Soviet geological expert Comrade Mashukov. In the early stage of preparing for construction, due to the lack of experience in large-scale deep-water drilling, we did not know where to start with many of the tasks before us. At this time, Comrade Mashukov came to our construction site, went deep into the site, investigated and understood the geological conditions on both banks, studied past geological data, and helped our geologists make a comprehensive survey and design, so that our work had a plan and a goal. Comrade Mashukov also put forward comprehensive opinions on the issue of drilling equipment, suggesting that we use large iron barges and large drilling rigs to ensure that geological data could be obtained completely and accurately under the fastest and safest conditions to meet the needs of engineering design. Comrade Mashukov also often went deep into the construction site to help us solve many complex technical problems and help us install machinery and become familiar with the operation of new machinery.
    In those most difficult days, workers and geologists also demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. Most of the workers came from the north, and had worked on land for a long time. They were not only unfamiliar with water operations technically, but also unaccustomed to it in their lives. When Wuhan was surrounded by floods, the drilling boat could not be positioned on the turbulent river, and the rapids repeatedly washed away the drilling boat, and repeatedly bent the casing that had been lowered into more than 40 meters of deep water; in countless windy and rainy days and nights, people insisted on rescuing drilling tools and equipment while feeling dizzy and vomiting. Waves more than one zhang [~3.3 meters] high knocked people down, but they immediately climbed up and continued to work. Due to the strong wind and waves, water transportation was sometimes completely cut off, and the comrades working on the drilling boat could not eat or change shifts all day long, but everyone did not stop working because of this. Just as the Yangtze River water level was rising, a large amount of floating objects and weeds on the river surface constantly hit the drilling boat, adhering to the drilling boat's steel cables and anchor chains, making the drilling work impossible to proceed smoothly. Many poisonous snakes mixed in the weeds also often climbed onto the drilling boat, drilled into people's tool boxes, helmets, and climbed on the drilling rig and drill, biting our comrades. In such an arduous battle, people cleared the weeds that hindered drilling on the one hand, and fought poisonous snakes on the other. Every day, people killed hundreds of poisonous snakes on the drilling boat.
    Because the water level of the Yangtze River continued to rise, the material reserves originally planned for the 16-meter water level construction could no longer meet the needs of objective changes, and difficulties arose in the supply of materials. The equipment needed for drilling came from all directions. For example, casings came from Guangzhou in the south, and drill bits came from Zhangjiakou in the north, and many other equipment came from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and other places. Therefore, sometimes a materialman had to travel a long way for a piece of equipment. Especially during the flood prevention struggle in Wuhan, this difficulty often affected work. Take a kind of yellow mud with very little sand content and extremely high viscosity as an example, which is very necessary in drilling. Originally, this kind of yellow mud was nothing in normal times, but difficulties arose in the flood prevention struggle. The young geologist Lu Genbao, in order to find this kind of yellow mud and prevent the geological drilling of the Yangtze River Bridge from being affected, ventured into the torrential rain in a vast flood, exploring the road with a bamboo pole, and sometimes had to wade through chest-deep water. After walking for a day and a night, he couldn't eat or sleep, and in such a difficult environment, he found people who cared about the construction of the motherland. With their help, he finally found this kind of yellow mud, so that the drilling work in the river channel did not stop because of this.
    The drilling work of the Yangtze River channel was carried out under such arduous and complex conditions. We not only overcame the technical difficulties brought about by the complex geological conditions and natural disasters, but also workers and geologists learned new technologies in such struggles. When the river channel drilling started, it took three or four days to lower the casing to the bedrock in water levels of more than ten meters, but later it only took six and a half hours to lower the casing in water several times deeper than that water level; at the beginning, it took more than 40 days to drill a pier, but later it only took seven days to complete the drilling task of one pier.
    Now, the geological exploration task of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been completed. Looking forward to the future prospects of the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, although the construction is still arduous and complex, with these brave, tenacious, and enthusiastic builders, under the leadership of the Party, with the care and support of the people of the whole country, and with the help of Soviet experts, we will surely overcome difficulties and complete the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and more engineering construction tasks entrusted to us by the motherland.

    战斗在长江上的七个月
    武汉长江大桥工程地质队政治委员　王永泉
    武汉长江大桥的地质钻探工作已全部结束了。从开工到全部完成勘探任务，一共经历了八个多月的时间。我们胜利地完成了桥渡线的河槽和两岸引桥的地质钻探，完成了武汉长江大桥建设准备工作中的一个关键步骤，为未来武汉长江大桥的建设提供了较完整而可靠的技术设计资料。
    八个多月来，我们差不多有七个月的时间是在波涛汹涌、水深流急的长江上度过的。在长江上，我们在不熟练的技术条件下，探索着河槽中的复杂的地质层，与武汉市有水文纪录以来从未出现过的洪水作过斗争，战胜了风浪和冰雪给我们在工作中带来的困难，按计划提前完成了艰巨的河槽钻探工作。
    根据过去的资料和现在钻探的结果，证明武汉长江大桥桥渡线河槽附近的地质分布情况和组织情况是相当复杂的。在这里，岩石的种类很多，也许在遥远的过去曾发生过极大的震动，因而现在的河槽原是一个陷落地带。由于震动陷落所产生的压力，不仅破坏了岩层连续性的脉向，形成犬牙交错的复杂的地质层；而且，许多岩石因为经受高压而变得十分破碎。这种复杂的地质情况，使我们在钻探技术上遭遇到许多意想不到的困难，这种破碎的岩石障碍我们取得作为技术设计依据的岩心。
    长江的水位很深，流速也很急。在长江水位上涨到高峰的时候，河槽最深的地方就有四十多公尺，流速每秒钟达三公尺五。这就是说，我们必须透过流速很急的深水进行钻探。在这样的深水中进行大规模的钻探，我们的管理干部、地质人员和有经验的老工人，都是非常陌生的，谁也没经历过这样的工作。何况，我们在工作中，还要经常经受不断上涨的洪水的威胁和突变的气候对我们的影响呢！
    所有这些困难都曾影响过我们的工作，但我们却没有被这些困难所吓倒。我们在党的领导下，在苏联专家无私的帮助和指导下，由于全体同志们的努力，一个又一个的困难都被我们克服了，战胜了。
    在长江上的日日夜夜，在那些艰苦困难的战斗中，首先，我们不能忘记苏联地质专家马舒柯夫同志的热情帮助。在筹备开工的初期，由于对大规模深水钻探缺乏经验，摆在我们面前的许多工作、都不知道从何着手。这时候，马舒柯夫同志来到我们工地，深入现场，调查了解两岸的地质情况，研究过去的地质资料，帮助我们的地质人员作出了全面的勘测设计，使我们的工作有了计划，有了目标。马舒柯夫同志对于钻探设备问题也提出了全面性的意见，建议我们采用大型铁驳和大型钻机，保证在最快最安全的条件下，完整而准确地取得地质资料，以适应工程设计的需要。马舒柯夫同志还经常深入工地帮助我们解决许多复杂的技术问题，帮助我们安装机具和熟悉新机具的操纵。
    在那些最困难的日子里，工人和地质人员，也发挥了高度的积极性。工人们大部分来自北方，长时期在陆地工作，对水上作业，不仅技术上很生疏，而且生活上也不习惯。当武汉市被洪水包围的时候，钻船在波涛汹涌的江面上无法定位，激流一次再一次地把钻船冲走，一次再一次地把下到四十多公尺深水中的套管冲弯；在无数狂风暴雨的白昼和黑夜，人们在晕眩呕吐中坚持抢救钻具和器材，一丈多高的浪头把人们打倒了，但他们马上爬起来继续工作。由于风浪大，水上交通有时候完全断绝，钻船上工作的同志成天吃不上饭，换不了班，但是，大家并不因此停止工作。正当长江水位高涨的时候，江面上大量的飘浮物和杂草，时刻撞击着钻船，黏附在钻船的钢缆和锚链上，使钻探工作不能顺利进行。夹杂在杂草中的许多毒蛇，也时常爬上钻船，钻进人们的工具箱里，安全帽里，攀缘在钻机和钻上，咬伤我们的同志。在这样艰苦的战斗中，人们一方面清除阻碍钻探进行的杂草，一方面还要和毒蛇搏斗，每天，人们把成百条的毒蛇打死在钻船上。
    由于长江水位不断上涨，原来预计十六公尺水位施工的材料储备已经不能适应客观情况变化的需要，材料供应问题便发生困难了。钻探所需用的器材，都是来自四面八方。譬如套管就是来自南方的广州，钻头又是来自北方的张家口，还有许多器材来自北京、天津、上海、重庆等地。因此，有时为了一件器材零件，材料员不得不跑很远的路。特别是武汉市防汛斗争中，这种困难时常影响工作。就拿一种含砂量极少、粘性极大的一种黄泥说吧，这是钻探中很需要的。本来，这种黄泥在平时不算什么，但是在防汛斗争中就发生困难了。年轻的地质人员陆根宝，为了找到这种黄泥，不让长江大桥的地质钻探受到影响，在一片汪洋的洪水中，冒着倾盆大雨，用竹篙探索着路，有时还要淌过齐胸的深水，走了一天一夜，饭吃不上，觉没处睡，就在这样艰苦的环境中，找到了关心祖国建设的人，经过他们的帮助，终于找到了这种黄泥，使河槽的钻探工作没有因此停顿下来。
    长江河槽的钻探工作，就是在这样艰巨复杂的情况下进行的。我们不仅战胜了复杂的地质情况带来的技术上的困难，战胜了自然灾害，而且工人和地质人员就在这样的斗争中学会了新的技术。河槽钻探开始的时候，在十几公尺深的水位中把套管下到岩盘，费时三、四天，但是，以后在比那个水位还要深几倍的深水中下套管，就只要六小时半了；开初钻一个桥墩得四十多天，以后只七天便能完成一个桥墩的钻探任务。
    现在，武汉长江大桥地质勘探任务已全部结束，展望未来长江大桥建设的远景，虽然建设仍然是艰巨的、复杂的，但是，我们有了这些勇敢、顽强、热情的建设者，在党的领导下，在全国人民的关怀支援下，在苏联专家帮助下，我们一定可以战胜困难，完成武汉长江大桥及祖国委托给我们的更多的工程建设任务。
