Why is the Dance World Silent?
    Sun Jingchen

The literary and art circles are gradually carrying out the struggle against bourgeois literary and artistic thought, theoretically criticizing bourgeois idealist aesthetics, and then conducting inspections in connection with the work of their respective departments. However, as one of the art departments, the dance world still shows no sign of action. As a dance worker, I feel that some leading comrades in the dance world have not given due attention to this struggle. They rarely discuss and study this aspect, and the various dance groups have not well launched studies related to this struggle. Some units have not even started studying to this day; the Beijing Dance School is one example. Why is a dance school, whose mission is to cultivate "well-rounded" dancers, indifferent to such an ideological struggle?

Doesn't bourgeois literary and artistic thought have any impact on our cause? Let us recall: how have we viewed our national heritage for a long time? Some comrades advocated, "Only study ballet," and the argument that "life is dance" was once rampant. It should be said that it is appropriate to learn excellent techniques from foreign dances, and it is right to demand the expression of life. The problem is that some of our comrades abandoned their own traditions, ignored the national character and popular nature of art forms, and showed discrimination and rejection towards folk dance. How much difference is there fundamentally between this and Hu Feng's bourgeois nihilistic view of the national heritage?

In terms of the attitude towards ideological remolding and the viewpoint of serving politics, haven't dance workers also exposed many problems? The ideological emotions of many works are very unhealthy. We clearly remember how programs such as "Peace Dove" and "Endless Flower" failed at the time.

Some people will say that these are old problems, and we have already made self-criticisms. But the question is, have these erroneous viewpoints ceased to exist? Of course, on the surface, the argument against national forms can no longer be heard. Everyone says that they want to respect and inherit national traditions, but is this actually how they act? Are they sincerely going deep into the folk to learn? Is there sufficient understanding of the classical heritage? The fact is not so. Many of us rarely go to the folk, and the study and research of classical heritage is very insufficient, and some people simply do not want to learn it or master it.

Someone said: "I believe in communism, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers also follow the Communist Party. Our ideological emotions are common." They thought that with such logic, they could equate their own petty-bourgeois ideological emotions with the ideological emotions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thus eliminating self-remolding and leading to the conclusion that "adapting folk dance does not necessarily require going to the folk." Some people advocate: "You go collect, and I will adapt." Some people advocate: "Our surroundings are life!" At the same time, some of us believe that the existing organizational method of "national art troupes" restricts creation and attempt to "develop individually." Aren't these all problems? Can we say the problems are not serious?

The dance world has consistently paid insufficient attention to political study and literary and artistic thought study, and rarely participates in mass struggles. This is a problem worthy of deep examination. Yes, the people cherish the dance cause, saying that this cause is still young and cannot be subject to general requirements. But precisely because it is young, it is even more necessary to be vigilant against the erosion of all non-working-class ideologies on the new China's dance cause, because we do not yet have enough "antitoxins." Neglecting this aspect will seriously endanger our cause. And when we have already encountered problems, we cannot excuse ourselves with "youth."

    舞蹈界为什么没有动静
    孙景琛
    文艺界正在逐步开展反对资产阶级文艺思想的斗争，从理论上批判资产阶级唯心主义的美学思想，进而联系本部门的工作进行了检查。但是，作为艺术部门之一的舞蹈界，却还看不到一点动静。我是一个舞蹈工作者，我觉得舞蹈界的某些领导同志对这一斗争还没有予以应有的重视。他们在这方面很少商谈和研究，而各个舞蹈团体也没有很好地展开有关这一斗争的学习，甚至有的单位至今还没有进行学习，北京舞蹈学校就是一个例子。以培养“全面发展”的舞蹈演员为自己任务的舞蹈学校，为什么对这样的思想斗争漠不关心？
    难道资产阶级文艺思想对我们事业并没有什么影响吗？让我们来回忆一下吧：我们长时期以来是怎样看待我们的民族遗产的？有的同志主张
  “只学巴蕾”，“生活就是舞蹈”的论调也曾嚣张一时。应该说，学习外国舞蹈中的优秀技术是应当的，要求表现生活也是对的，问题是我们有的同志抛弃了自己的传统，忽视了艺术形式的民族性和人民性，对民间舞表示了歧视和排斥——这和胡风的对待民族遗产的资产阶级虚无主义的观点在基本上又有多大差别？
    在对待思想改造的态度和为政治服务的观点上，舞蹈工作者不是也暴露过很多问题吗？许多作品的思想感情是很不健康的。我们还清楚记得当时的“和平鸽”“无穷花”等节目是怎样遭到失败的。
    有人会说，这些都是老问题了，我们已经做过检讨。但问题是这些错误的观点是否已经不存在了？固然，现在在表面上已听不到不要民族形式的论调了，大家都说要尊重和继承民族传统，但是实际上是不是这样行动了呢？是不是真心诚意地深入民间去学习了呢？对古典遗产是不是有足够的理解了呢？事实并不是这样。我们有很多人很少到民间去，对古典遗产的学习和钻研也非常不够，甚至有些人根本不想学习它、掌握它。
    有人说：“我相信共产主义，工农兵也是跟着共产党走，我们之间的思想情感是共同的。”他们以为用这样的逻辑，就可以在自己的小资产阶级思想情感和工农兵的思想情感之间画上了等号，而取消了自我改造，并进而得出了结论说：
  “改编民间舞不一定到民间去。”有人主张：“你们去收集，我来改编。”有人主张：“我们的周围就是生活！”同时，我们也正有人认为现有的
  “国家艺术团体”的组织方式限制了创作而企图
  “个人发展”。这些，不都是问题吗？能说问题不严重吗？
    舞蹈界对政治学习、文艺思想学习一贯是注意得不够的，很少参加群众性的斗争活动。这是一个值得深刻检查的问题。是的，人民爱护舞蹈事业，说这事业还年轻，不能作一般的要求。但正因为年轻，就更需要警惕一切非工人阶级思想意识对新中国舞蹈事业的侵蚀，因为我们还没有足够的“抗毒素”，在这方面的忽略就将使我们的事业遭到严重的危害。而当我们已经发生了问题的时候，那就更不能以“年轻”来原谅自己了。
