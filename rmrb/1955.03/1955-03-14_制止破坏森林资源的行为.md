Our nation's forest resources are severely insufficient, and the contradiction between timber supply and national construction needs is extremely acute. One of the significant reasons for this insufficiency is that successive reactionary rulers only destroyed forests without building them, only devastated them without protecting them, leading to a gradual decrease in forest resources. After liberation, we learned from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and began to change the historical situation of destroying forest resources. We treated forests as important national wealth, protecting and nurturing them. In the Lesser Khingan Mountains and other old logging areas, we carried out much nurturing and regeneration work, transforming many barren hills and bald ridges back into green mountains and forests. This work has achieved considerable success. The state is now comprehensively planning a larger-scale and more comprehensive nurturing and regeneration program to actively expand forest resources.

However, some forest harvesting departments have not implemented the policy of nurturing forests and still adhere to the destructive logging methods of the pre-liberation era. According to recent information, in the Lesser Khingan Mountains and Wanda Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, approximately 600,000 hectares of newly logged areas have had their conditions for nurturing and regeneration destroyed due to indiscriminate logging. The majority of these areas have become residual forest zones, with an estimated 20% becoming barren hills and bald ridges, making natural regeneration impossible. The state has stipulated that the felling rate in these forest areas should not exceed 60%, and that a certain number of mother trees and saplings must be left behind so that the logged areas can naturally regenerate and grow into mature forests after several years. However, in recent years, the forest harvesting departments in these areas have not earnestly implemented the state's rational harvesting plan. In some places, the felling rate has reached 80% or even 100%. Some places simply used the old "shaving head" method of logging used by the Japanese puppet regime, leaving not a single mother tree. For example, the Nancha Forestry Bureau had a large logging task last year, and the leaders were afraid of failing to complete the "task." As a result, most of the five logging yards under its jurisdiction "shaved their heads" during logging, leaving even few old and crooked trees. The situation at the Youhao Forestry Bureau was similar. Workers said: "It's like threshing in a field, all you see is a chaotic pile of fallen trees." Some forest farms nominally left mother trees and saplings, but in reality, it was the same as not leaving any. For example, the mother trees left by some forest farms under the Shangganling Forestry Bureau were mostly diseased, rotten, old, damaged, or solitary trees, which soon withered and died after being left behind. The saplings that were left behind also withered and died because of the sudden change to a completely open area, increased ground temperature, and dry soil. Some cadres emphasized, "It's going to die anyway," and simply didn't leave a single mother tree. Although mother trees and saplings were left in forest areas such as Shuangzihe, most of the mother trees and saplings were knocked down and crushed during tractor logging. This situation is even more serious in areas with a high degree of mechanization. For example, the Dailing Electrified Logging Yard not only did not leave a single precious Korean pine, but also could not even protect a small shrub and turf. The forest farm was cleared completely, and the workers said with regret: "The forest has been completely ruined." Some forestry bureaus also carried out logging in the upper reaches of water sources and in the mountains (these areas are all restricted areas), which seriously affected soil and water conservation. For example, the banks of the upper reaches of the Tangwang River and Haoliang River were once covered with forests, but in recent years, most of the trees have been cut down. Soil erosion is very serious, and large rocks often fall from the mountains and roll onto the railway tracks. Places where mountain floods never occurred in the past also experienced them last year.

Even worse, some forestry bureaus, simply to make up the "task" numbers (because the nearby forest farms did not have enough trees to harvest), did not hesitate to adopt a destructive "kill the chicken to get the egg" type of "return operation" logging, and attempted to reduce "costs" by using existing equipment and transportation conditions. For example, the southeast mountain of Langxiang had already been logged after liberation, and the mother trees and saplings that were left behind were in good condition, so the growth situation was good. However, the bureau carried out a second logging in the area to make up the task, sweeping away all the remaining 30% or so of the mother trees and young small-diameter trees, turning the southeast mountain into a bare barren mountain. Similar situations exist in other bureaus. The Provincial Forestry Department cultivated a mother tree forest entirely composed of beautiful and excellent Korean pines in Shihuan Town, preparing it for supplying seeds for afforestation throughout the province. The Forestry Department's operating station spent more than 300 million yuan (old currency) just to clear the forest farm. The Shihuan Town Forestry Bureau took advantage of the fact that the staff of the operating station were busy moving seedlings and secretly entered the forest area to carry out illegal logging. By the time the operating station discovered it, the mother tree forest had been completely leveled. Some cadres, in order to complete the "task," even condoned workers to go to any length to "overfulfill" the task. Some individual workers could earn more money by "overfulfilling" the task. Although it was stipulated that superior trees should be left and inferior trees removed, the result was that inferior trees were left and superior trees removed. The good trees were cut down, and all the mother trees that should have been left were cut down. In Shangganling and Nancha, "advanced producers" who indiscriminately logged and overfulfilled production tasks were discovered, and they were even rewarded.

The Lesser Khingan Mountains and other forest areas in Heilongjiang Province are known for producing world-renowned precious tree species such as Korean pine. Its timber production accounts for nearly one-half of the total national output and is currently our country's main timber supply base. Therefore, if this situation continues, it will affect our country's construction, climate, and soil and water conservation. At the same time, protecting forest resources is a long-term plan that takes a hundred years. If mistakes are made in logging, it will take eighty to one hundred years to correct them. At present, the harvesting departments only care about tasks and not about regeneration, only care about logging and not about clearing (the state stipulates that harvesting departments must clear the forest farms after logging to create good conditions for nurturing and regeneration), only care about the present and not about the future, and take an indifferent attitude towards national forest resources. This is essentially a concrete reflection of bourgeois management thinking in the forest industry. Its higher-level leading organs have rarely criticized this bourgeois management thinking for a long time. Such a bad behavior as illegal logging of mother tree forests has not yet been dealt with, which makes the phenomenon of some harvesting departments destroying forest resources continue to be unchecked for a long time. This phenomenon is also related to the backwardness of our forest management work. Now, this phenomenon of destroying forest resources must not be allowed to continue. We demand that the Ministry of Forestry conduct a comprehensive and thorough inspection of this situation, effectively stop it, and strengthen strict supervision of the harvesting departments.

    制止破坏森林资源的行为
    郝重运　金雨困
    我国森林资源非常不足，木材供应和国家建设需要之间的矛盾是十分尖锐的。造成我国森林资源不足的重要原因之一，就是历代反动统治者对森林只有破坏没有建设，只有摧残没有保护，使森林资源日渐减少。解放后，我们学习了苏联先进经验，开始改变了破坏森林资源的历史情况，把森林当作国家重要的财富加以保护抚育，在小兴安岭等旧采伐迹地上曾进行了许多抚育更新工作，使许多荒山秃岭重新又变为青山绿林。这一工作已有很多成效。现在国家正在通盘规划更大规模的全面的抚育更新工作，以积极扩大森林资源。
    但是，有些森林采伐部门，没有执行抚育森林的方针，依然承袭了解放前那种破坏森林资源的开采方法，据最近了解，在黑龙江省境内的小兴安岭和完达山脉约六十万公顷的新采伐迹地上，由于滥采滥伐，破坏了抚育更新的条件，使绝大部分的迹地已成为残林区，估计约有百分之二十左右已成为荒山秃岭，已无法进行天然更新了。国家曾规定这些林区采伐率不得超过百分之六十，必须留下一定数量的母树和幼树，使采伐过的迹地能够进行天然的更新，若干年后又能长成为成熟林。但是近几年来这些地区的森林采伐部门，不认真贯彻国家合理采伐的方案。有的地方采伐率竟达到了百分之八十，甚至到了百分之百，有的地方索性就沿用着日伪的“剃光头”式的老办法进行采伐，一棵母树也不留。如南岔森林工业局去年采伐任务较大，领导上怕完不成“任务”，结果所属五个伐木场在采伐时大部“剃了光头”，连东倒西歪的老龄树也不多了。友好森林工业局的情况也差不多，工人们说：“就像庄稼地里打场一样，只见一片一片乱倒木”。有的林场虽形式上留了母树和幼树，但实际上等于未留。如上甘岭森林工业局有的林场留的母树大部是病腐木、老龄木、损伤木或单株木，留后不久就枯死，留的幼树亦因骤然变成全光区，地温增高，土壤干燥，也纷纷枯死。有的干部强调“反正留也死”，索性连一棵母树也不留了。双子河等林区虽留了母树和幼树，但经拖拉机集材，大部母树和幼树都压倒和砸伤了。这种情况越在机械化程度高的地方更严重，如带岭电器化伐木场，不仅连一棵珍贵的红松未留，连一点小灌木和草皮也保不住，林场推得光光的，工人痛惜的说：“把林子都糟塌完了”。有的森林工业局在水源的上游和山岭间也进行采伐（这些地区都是封禁地区），严重地影响了水土保持。如汤旺河和浩良河上游两岸都是森林，近年来树木大部分都采光了，水土冲刷很厉害，山上经常掉下大石块，滚到铁轨上，过去从不发生山洪的地方去年也发生了。
    更恶劣的是：有的森林工业局单纯为了凑足“任务”数字（因附近林场可采量不足），竟不惜采取“杀鸡取蛋”式的毁灭性的“回头作业”采伐，并企图借此降低“成本”（因可利用原有的设备和交通条件）。如郎乡东南山解放后已进行过采伐，留的母树和幼树都较好，因此生长的情况良好，但该局为了凑任务，又在该地进行第二次采伐，将留下百分之三十左右的母树和年青的小径树木全部扫光，使东南山变成光秃的荒山。在其它局也有类似的情况。省林业厅在世环镇培育了一个全为美丽优良的红松母树林，准备作为供应全省造林采种用的。林业厅经营所化了三亿多元（旧币）刚把林场清理好，世环镇森林工业局乘着经营所人员忙于移苗时，便偷偷进入林区进行盗伐，待经营所发觉时，母树林已全部伐为平地。有的干部为了完成“任务”，竟然纵容工人不择手段地去“超额”完成任务，个别工人因“超额”能多赚钱，虽然规定应该留优去劣，结果是留劣去优，那棵树好就砍那棵，把应留的母树全都砍了。在上甘岭和南岔，均发现有这样滥采滥伐超额完成生产任务的“先进生产者”，而他们还受到奖励。
    黑龙江省小兴安岭等林区是以盛产举世闻名的红松等珍贵树种而著称的，它的木材产量约占全国总产量近二分之一，是我国当前主要的木材供应基地。因此这种情况若任其长此下去，势将影响我们国家的建设、气候和水土的保持。同时保护森林资源是个百年大计的问题，如果采伐上造成了错误，这就需要八十年到一百年才能纠正过来，目前采伐部门只顾任务不顾更新，只顾采伐不顾清理（国家规定采伐部门于采伐后要进行林场的清理，以为抚育更新创造良好条件），只顾目前不顾将来，对国家森林资源采取漠不关心的态度，实质上就是资产阶级经营思想在森林工业中的具体反映。而它的上级领导机关长时期对这种资产阶级经营思想很少展开批评，像盗伐母树林这样恶劣的行为至今也尚未处理，这就使一些采伐部门破坏森林资源的现象长期得不到制止。这种现象还与我们的森林经营管理工作落后有关。现在这种破坏森林资源的现象决不能容其继续存在，我们要求林业部对这一情况进行全面彻底的检查，予以有效的制止，并加强对采伐部门的严格监督。（附图片）
