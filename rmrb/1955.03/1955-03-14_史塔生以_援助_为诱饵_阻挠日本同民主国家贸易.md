    Stassen Uses "Aid" as Bait
    to Obstruct Japanese Trade with Democratic Countries
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th] Stassen, the Director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, left Tokyo for the United States on the 11th after more than three days of activities in Japan.

    During his stay in Japan, Stassen held a series of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and other government leaders and economic figures, exchanging views on the so-called U.S. "Southeast Asia Aid Plan." According to Kyodo News, Stassen "did not seem to clarify the full picture of the so-called Stassen Plan for developing Southeast Asia" during the talks. Furthermore, he also "did not explicitly answer whether to adopt the plan expected by the Japanese government in its memorandum, that is, to set up an international fund organization aimed at developing Southeast Asia." However, Stassen used this ambiguous "aid" for enticement and pressure, repeatedly warning Japan not to trade with peaceful and democratic countries. According to United Press, he even threatened Japan, saying that Japan's expansion of trade with peaceful and democratic countries "will increase the danger of a third world war." In response to this issue, Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi told Stassen that although Japan hopes to develop markets in Southeast Asia, the purchasing power of these countries is weak. In order to obtain foreign exchange, Japan's trade with peaceful and democratic countries is unavoidable.

    In the talks, Stassen gave evasive answers to some of the requests made by the Japanese government. These requests included lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports, reducing Japan's burden of disguised occupation fees, reducing the interest on Japan's various debts to the United States, and relaxing the dollar terms for U.S. "aid" surplus agricultural products. On the other hand, Stassen actively urged Japan to rearm. He criticized Japan for being "too dependent" on other countries for "defense" and advocated that Japan increase its military spending.

### 史塔生以“援助”为诱饵  阻挠日本同民主国家贸易

    史塔生以“援助”为诱饵
    阻挠日本同民主国家贸易
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在日本进行了三天多的活动后，十一日离开东京回美国。
    史塔生在日本期间，曾和日本首相鸠山一郎等政府首脑及经济界人士举行了一连串的会谈，就所谓美国的“东南亚援助计划”问题交换了意见。据共同社报道，史塔生在会谈中“似乎并没有阐明关于开发东南亚的所谓史塔生计划的全貌”。并且，他也“没有明确答复是否采纳日本政府在它的备忘录里所期待的计划，即设置一个旨在开发东南亚的国际基金组织”。但是，史塔生却用这种含糊的
  “援助”进行利诱和压力，再三警告日本不要同和平民主国家进行贸易。据合众社透露，他甚至向日本恫吓说：日本扩大同和平民主国家的贸易，“将会增加第三次世界大战的危险”。对于这个问题，日本通商产业相石桥湛山曾向史塔生表示，日本虽然希望发展在东南亚的市场，但是这些国家的购买力低弱。为了获取外汇，日本同和平民主国家进行贸易是免不了的。
    在会谈中，史塔生对日本政府提出的一些要求，作了搪塞的答复。这些要求包括降低美国对日本进口货的关税，削减日本负担的变相占领费，减低日本对美国各种债务的利息和放宽美“援”剩余农产品的美元条款等。另一方面，史塔生积极督促日本重新武装。他责备日本在“防务”上“过于依赖”其他国家，主张日本增加军费。
