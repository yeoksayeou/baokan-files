Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th - The Ngo Dinh Diem clique is engaged in conspiratorial activities, attempting to tear up the Geneva Accords. Reports from Saigon say that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has launched a signature campaign against the Geneva Accords. A "protest" purportedly signed by "two thousand intellectuals" has appeared in Saigon. This "protest" considers the Geneva Accords "completely invalid," even accusing the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam of being "incompetent," demanding its "automatic dissolution," and also requesting the French government to withdraw the Saint-Denis delegation, which is conducting economic and cultural negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    This conspiratorial activity is also taking place in Haiphong. Members of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique went to the Phung Hung School to threaten teachers into signing against the Geneva Accords and the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam.
    At the same time, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is making every effort to conduct war propaganda about "marching north" within its army. Radio Haiphong broadcast that the "Political Security Military Headquarters" of South Vietnam had organized a preparatory committee to launch a propaganda "campaign" of "arming the spirit and strengthening the will" in the Bao Dai army. The broadcast admitted that the purpose of this propaganda "campaign" was to incite the "will" of the Bao Dai army to "march north" and invade the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique members in central and southern Vietnam are also spreading rumors that, with the help of the United States, they are organizing a "crusade" of Catholics from among the North Vietnamese Catholics who are being forcibly relocated to South Vietnam, in order to use it to "liberate" the "Catholic holy land" in North Vietnam in the future.

    吴庭艳集团阴谋撕毁日内瓦协定
    【新华社河内二十六日电】吴庭艳集团正在进行阴谋活动，企图撕毁日内瓦协定。西贡来的消息说，吴庭艳集团已经展开了一个反对日内瓦协定的签名运动，一份据说有“两千个知识分子”签名的“抗议书”已经在西贡出现。这份“抗议书”认为日内瓦协定“根本无效”，甚至指责越南国际监督和监察委员会“无能”，要求它“自动解散”，还要求法国政府撤回正在和越南民主共和国进行经济文化谈判的圣德尼代表团。
    这个阴谋活动也在海防进行。吴庭艳集团分子曾到冯兴学校去威胁教员签名反对日内瓦协定和越南国际监督和监察委员会。
    同时，吴庭艳集团正竭力在它的军队中进行“北进”的战争宣传。海防电台广播说，南越的“保政军司令部”已经组织了一个筹备委员会，将在保大军队中展开一个“武装精神，健全意志”的宣传“战役”。广播承认，这个宣传“战役”的目的，在于鼓动保大军队“北进”侵犯越南民主共和国的“意志”。
    吴庭艳集团分子还在中越南部和南越扬言，他们在美国的帮助下正在被迫迁到南越去的北越天主教徒中组织一支天主教徒的“十字军”，以便将来用来“解放”在北越的“天主教圣地”。
