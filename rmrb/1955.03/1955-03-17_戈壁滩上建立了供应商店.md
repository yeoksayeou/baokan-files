Supplier Stores Established on the Gobi Desert

    Eleven supplier stores have been established on the construction sites of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the Gobi Desert and grasslands. The slogan put forward by the salespersons of the supplier stores is: "Wherever the railway is built, we will supply to that location." The commodities they supply to the railway construction workers include general merchandise, non-staple foods, and recreational supplies. The grassland area is a bitter water region, and the supplier stores have managed to transport tea and white sugar. They used sacks to transport fresh vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, and radishes from hundreds of kilometers away to the construction site, and also transported fresh fish and prawns from Qingdao, and oranges from Guangdong. The mobile supply teams organized by the supplier stores often brave the strong winds to travel back and forth on the Gobi Desert construction sites.

    戈壁滩上建立了供应商店
    在戈壁滩和草滩修筑兰新铁路的筑路工地上，已有十一个供应商店。供应商店的售货员们提出的口号是：“铁路修到那里，我们就供应到那里。”他们供应给筑路工人的商品包括日用百货、副食品和文娱用品。草滩一带是苦水地区，供应商店设法运来了茶叶和白糖。他们用麻袋把白菜、菠菜、萝卜等新鲜蔬菜，从数百公里外运到工地，还从青岛运来了鲜鱼和对虾，从广东运来了橘子。供应商店组织的流动供应组，经常冒着狂风往来在戈壁滩工地上。　（新华社）
