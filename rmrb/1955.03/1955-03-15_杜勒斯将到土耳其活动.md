Xinhua News Agency, Istanbul, March 13th (TASS): "The Dawn" newspaper reports that, according to well-informed sources, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will visit Turkey in May to negotiate the establishment of a Middle East "defense system" with Turkish Prime Minister Menderes and Foreign Minister Koprulu.

"The Dawn" wrote regarding this news: "The United States sympathizes with the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, and will therefore do its utmost to have other Arab countries join this treaty."

What has attracted the attention of the press is that the news that Eden will go to Ankara on March 16 to discuss the UK joining the Turkish-Iraqi treaty was immediately followed by the news that Dulles would visit Turkey.

    杜勒斯将到土耳其活动
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社伊斯坦布尔十三日讯：“黎明报”报道，据消息灵通人士透露，美国国务卿杜勒斯将在五月间到土耳其，同土耳其总理曼德列斯和外交部长柯普路鲁谈判建立中东“防务体系”的问题。
    “黎明报”就这个消息写道：“美国对土耳其—伊拉克条约怀着同情，所以将尽力要使其他阿拉伯国家加入这个条约。”
    引起新闻界注意的是，艾登将在三月十六日到安卡拉商谈英国加入土耳其—伊拉克条约这个消息刚一宣布，立刻就传来了杜勒斯要访问土耳其的消息。
