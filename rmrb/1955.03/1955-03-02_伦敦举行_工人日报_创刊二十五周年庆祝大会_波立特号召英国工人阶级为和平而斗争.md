Xinhua News Agency, London, 1st Dispatch from TASS: A mass rally celebrating the 25th anniversary of the "Daily Worker" was held in London on February 27th, attended by 5,000 people. The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, and the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Harry Pollitt, spoke at the meeting.

    Dr. Johnson said that he welcomed the Soviet government's proposals on banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and reducing armaments. He said that pursuing a policy of peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union was in Britain's interests. His words were met with applause.

    Pollitt said: The power of the working class is greater than the power of the hydrogen bomb. If the power of the working class is used, it can be guaranteed that hydrogen bombs will never be used. The greatest task at present is to fight for peace.

    Pollitt criticized the British government's entire military and political strategy as being based on developing hydrogen bombs to counter the Soviet Union, and pointed out that socialist countries uphold peace first and foremost because they care about the future of working people all over the world. Therefore, today the Soviet Union is always the first to put forward constructive peace proposals on all important international issues.

    Pollitt attacked the policy of rearming West Germany. He pointed out that the working classes of West Germany, France, Britain, and other countries are now capable of stopping the implementation of this policy and preventing the outbreak of a third world war. However, in order to achieve this goal, the forces of peace must be strengthened. The entire working-class movement should fight for a peace policy based on the following points:

    1. Germany must not be rearmed, but instead, four-power negotiations should be held to achieve Germany's peaceful reunification, and to achieve the establishment of an all-European collective security system to prevent any aggression in Europe.

    2. Destroy all existing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, ban the manufacture of such weapons, and reach an agreement on the reduction of all armaments.

    3. Stop American aggression in the Far East, return Taiwan to China, and admit People's China to the United Nations.

    4. Stop the colonial wars against the people of Kenya and Malaya, and allow all colonial peoples to obtain freedom and democratic rights.

    5. Britain should abolish its military alliance with the United States, and withdraw all American troops and bases from Britain, so that the British government can pursue an independent peaceful foreign policy.

    伦敦举行“工人日报”创刊二十五周年庆祝大会
    波立特号召英国工人阶级为和平而斗争
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：二月二十七日，在伦敦举行了庆祝“工人日报”创刊二十五周年的群众大会，参加大会的有五千人。坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊博士和英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特在会上讲了话。
    约翰逊博士说，他欢迎苏联政府关于禁止原子武器、氢武器和裁减军备的建议。他说：奉行同苏联和平合作的政策是符合英国的利益的。他的话赢得了一片掌声。
    波立特说：工人阶级的力量比氢弹的力量大。如果运用工人阶级的力量，就能够保证氢弹永远不会被人使用。目前最伟大的任务是为和平而斗争。
    波立特批评英国政府的整个军事和政治战略都是以发展氢弹来对付苏联为基础，并且指出：社会主义国家维护的首先是和平，因为它们关心全世界劳动人民的前途。因此，今天苏联在一切重要的国际问题上总是率先提出建设性的和平建议。
    波立特抨击了重新武装西德的政策。他指出：西德、法国、英国和其他国家的工人阶级现在是有能力制止这种政策的执行和阻止第三次世界大战的爆发的。但是，要实现这个目的，就必须加强和平力量。整个工人阶级的运动应该为以下列各点为基础的和平政策而斗争：
    一、德国不得重新武装，而代之以四国谈判，以达成德国的和平重新统一，达成防止在欧洲的任何侵略的全欧集体安全体系的建立。
    二、销毁一切现有的原子武器和氢武器，禁止制造这种武器，就裁减一切军备达成协议。
    三、制止美国在远东的侵略，把台湾交还中国，并且接纳人民中国参加联合国。
    四、制止针对怯尼亚和马来亚人民的殖民战争，使一切殖民地人民都得到自由和民主权利。
    五、英国废除它同美国的军事联盟，使一切美国军队和基地撤出英国，以便使英国政府可以奉行独立的和平外交政策。
