    Correctly Publicize the Specific Policies of Agricultural Cooperativization to the Broad Masses of Farmers

    The work of developing agricultural production cooperatives this spring has been completed in most areas. Nearly 600,000 agricultural production cooperatives, including 15 million farm households, have begun or are preparing for spring plowing. The broad masses of farmers support the Party's general policy of agricultural cooperativization. However, many cooperative members currently want to understand: How exactly will the cooperative treat their privately owned means of production? Many farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative also want to know: If they work harder on the land now and add better livestock and farm tools, will they suffer when they join the cooperative in the future? These questions should be answered clearly.

    The "Resolution on Spring Plowing Production" passed recently by the Sixth Plenary Session of the State Council has made unified and clear provisions for the specific policies of current agricultural production and the cooperative movement. The implementation of this resolution will further enhance the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in the cooperative and develop production.

    Agricultural cooperativization is a gradual change in rural relations of production, gradually transforming farmers' individual ownership into collective ownership. This transformation is not carried out by means of expropriation, but by means of voluntary association; by means of rationally handling farmers' main means of production and striving to develop the public economy. Therefore, properly treating the economic interests of farmers, that is, properly treating the past labor achievements and future labor achievements of farmers, is of decisive significance for attracting farmers to participate in the cooperative movement and improving farmers' production enthusiasm.

    Currently, in the agricultural cooperativization movement, properly treating the economic interests of farmers is mainly manifested in correctly stipulating and implementing specific policies for the handling of means of production, income distribution, and production investment. Public ownership of the main means of production and the implementation of a complete system of distribution according to labor are one of the ultimate goals of agricultural cooperativization. However, this should be gradually achieved on the basis of improving the production level of agricultural production cooperatives and raising the awareness of cooperative members. If the cooperative has just been established and is eager to implement the system of not distributing dividends on land, on the one hand, it will increase the burden on the majority of members, and on the other hand, it will make members with more means of production have doubts, which is not conducive to both poor peasants and middle peasants. In general, agricultural production cooperatives should not be eager to implement the system of not distributing dividends on land when they are first established; land remuneration should be slightly lower than labor remuneration, but it should not be too low; the actual amount of land remuneration that has been stipulated should not be reduced within a few years unless there is a disaster. Draft animals and large farm tools should be used uniformly by the cooperative; however, it is not necessary to adopt the method of depreciating and turning them over to the public, but it is appropriate for the cooperative to rent them at a reasonable price. If all members agree to depreciate and turn them over to the public, the reasonable price and method (mainly the proportion of shares drawn and the repayment period of the remaining part after the shares have been spread) should also be democratically discussed by all members. Small farm tools should be brought and used by the members themselves in principle, and there is no need to unify them into the cooperative. Livestock and trees that were originally operated by individuals do not need to be managed uniformly by the cooperative for the time being (of course, production cooperatives that are mainly engaged in animal husbandry and forestry can be managed uniformly). In the first year of running the cooperative, members must apportion a portion of the production funds as the "bottom cushion" of the whole cooperative; generally speaking, a reasonable method is to apportion according to land yield, and the method of apportioning equally according to labor is unreasonable. In some cooperatives where the land share is very small, it is also possible to apportion according to a certain proportion of land and labor. After the apportionment according to regulations, the part invested more by some members should be stipulated to be returned after the harvest in the same year for production in the same year, and the cooperative should pay reasonable interest. Appropriate remuneration should be given for the fertilizer accumulated by the members and the labor of land preparation before joining the cooperative.

    Correct provisions must be made for these specific policies that are directly related to the vital economic interests of the masses, and they must be correctly implemented in specific work; at the same time, they must be correctly publicized to the broad masses inside and outside the cooperative. Only in this way can the cooperative movement develop healthily and play the role of improving productivity.

    From the autumn of 1954 to the present, the agricultural cooperativization movement has progressed relatively quickly. As pointed out in the resolution of the State Council, the development of the movement is basically healthy and normal. This reflects the warm support of the broad masses of farmers for cooperativization. However, also because the progress has been rapid, many cadres' policy thinking and work experience are not sufficient, and at the same time, they are busy with many other intense tasks in the countryside, so the policy education and organizational work on cooperativization carried out among the peasant masses are not meticulous enough. Many comrades only understand the general policy of agricultural cooperativization, only pay attention to publicizing the general policy to the masses; but they do not fully understand the specific policies of agricultural cooperativization, so naturally they do not pay much attention to publicizing these specific policies to the masses. Although some places have publicized and explained the specific policies, the publicity and explanations are incomplete and inappropriate.

    My country has a vast territory and complex conditions. The widespread unfolding of the agricultural cooperativization movement is still short, and the experience in implementing the specific policies of agricultural cooperativization is still very insufficient. This increases the difficulty of correctly grasping the specific policies in grassroots practical work. Some comrades have the enthusiasm to build socialism as soon as possible, but they lack the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Therefore, they have made inappropriate provisions for the issue of cooperatives handling the means of production, and have not taken good care of the actual economic interests of some members, which should be corrected quickly.

    The general policy of national industrialization and agricultural cooperativization stipulated by our Party is completely correct. To ensure the correct implementation of this general policy, it is also necessary to correctly stipulate various specific policies. Only specific policies, only understanding specific policies, without a general policy or not understanding the general policy, cannot guarantee that the revolutionary movement will advance in the correct direction; but only the general policy, only understanding the general policy, without stipulating specific policies or not understanding specific policies, cannot guarantee the healthy development of the revolutionary movement and the smooth realization of the revolutionary goal.

    Our agricultural production task is very arduous. In order to guarantee the victory of the Party's general line, in order to guarantee the successful realization of the first five-year plan of our country, we must break through many difficulties and complete the agricultural production plan. In order to improve productivity, we must steadily implement socialist transformation; and any measures for socialist transformation must strive to be conducive to improving the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses and strive to avoid hindering the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses. The key to improving the production enthusiasm of farmers at present, in addition to improving the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, is mainly to strictly rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives in accordance with the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. To conscientiously implement the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, it is necessary to make clear provisions on some specific policy issues in the agricultural cooperativization movement and disseminate them to the broad masses.

    The people's governments of Wenjiang and other counties in Sichuan Province issued announcements one after another in January, announcing to the broad masses the specific policies of agricultural production cooperatives on the handling of issues such as cattle, farm tools, trees, pig feed, and production investment. This is in line with the spirit of the State Council's resolution on agricultural cooperativization. This practice has achieved good results. The various policies announced in the announcements of the counties in Sichuan are specific, concise, and clear; it concentrates on the several issues that the local masses are most concerned about and urgently need to solve, and makes clear provisions. With certain criteria, the difficulties and chaotic phenomena in grassroots practical work that are not easy to grasp the policies can be overcome. The formal announcement by the government in the form of a proclamation is easier to gain the trust of the people, eliminate the unnecessary concerns of some farmers, and unite more working farmers; on the one hand, it can more forcefully strike at the enemy and crush the conspiracies of class dissidents and hidden counter-revolutionaries to spread rumors and sabotage.

    The contents of the announcements in the counties of Sichuan are not necessarily applicable to other regions; issuing announcements is not the only way to announce specific policies to the broad masses of farmers; however, the matter of publicizing and explaining the specific policies of agricultural cooperativization to the broad masses of farmers is something that all regions should do. It should be noted that the content of the publicity should be suitable for the ideological situation of the cooperative movement and the peasant masses inside and outside the cooperative in various places, and should be solved in response to the outstanding problems currently existing in the local area. Generally speaking, what urgently needs to be solved in the countryside at present is the issue of the distribution ratio of labor and land, the issue of rental prices or depreciation and turning over to the public of draft animals, and the issue of production investment; different regions also have other issues that the local masses are particularly concerned about. These provisions must be based on the basic spirit of the Party Central Committee's resolution on the development of agricultural production cooperatives, the fundamental line of socialist transformation in the countryside stipulated by the Party Central Committee, the State Council's resolution on spring plowing production, and the principles of other relevant documents issued by the State Council and the Party Central Committee. The provincial party committees and provincial people's committees of various provinces must give unified leadership to this work carried out by the counties and give specific assistance. It should also be noted that it is not enough to just announce a few policies, but it is necessary to organize and lead a widespread and direct explanation and publicity to the broad masses of farmers (not only to the members, but also to pay attention to the masses outside the cooperative), and to solve the existing specific problems specifically in practical work.

    Our purpose is to convey the several specific policies in the agricultural cooperativization movement that the masses are most concerned about to the broad masses correctly, quickly, widely, and directly. This, like publicizing the policies of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, is an extremely important political task at present and an important guarantee for smoothly carrying out the spring plowing production movement and developing agricultural production. All provinces and counties should do this work well without exception.

### 向广大农民正确宣传农业合作化的具体政策

    向广大农民正确宣传农业合作化的具体政策社论
    今年春季发展农业生产合作社的工作在大部地区已经完成。包括了一千五百万农户的近六十万个农业生产合作社，已经开始或正在准备进行春耕生产。广大农民群众是拥护党的农业合作化的总政策的。但是，许多合作社社员目前希望了解：合作社究竟要怎样对待他们的私有生产资料？许多还没有入社的农民也希望知道：现在在土地上再多加工，再添置好的牲畜、农具，将来入社的时候会不会吃亏？这些问题是应该得到明确的回答的。
    最近国务院第六次全体会议通过的关于春耕生产的决议，对于当前农业生产和合作化运动的各项具体政策，做了统一的明确的规定。按照这个决议实行的结果，必将进一步提高农民参加合作社和发展生产的积极性。
    农业合作化就是逐步地改变农村的生产关系，把农民个体所有制逐步地改造为集体所有制。这种改造，不是采取剥夺的办法，而是采取自愿联合的办法；采取合理地处理农民的主要生产资料，并努力发展公共经济的办法。因此，妥善地对待农民的经济利益，也就是妥善地对待农民过去的劳动成果和今后的劳动成果，对于吸引农民参加合作化运动和提高农民的生产积极性，就有决定性的意义。
    当前在农业合作化运动中，妥善地对待农民的经济利益，主要表现在正确地规定和执行处理生产资料、收益分配和生产投资的具体政策。主要生产资料公有和实行完全的按劳分配制度，是农业合作化的最终目的之一。但是，这是要在提高农业生产合作社的生产水平和提高社员的觉悟程度的基础上逐步做到的。如果合作社刚刚成立，就急于实行生产资料公有，一方面会加重多数社员的负担，一方面会使生产资料较多的社员发生疑虑，既不利于贫农又不利于中农。一般的农业生产合作社初创办时，不可急于实行土地不分红的制度；土地报酬应稍低于劳动报酬，但也不宜低得太多；规定好的土地报酬的实际数量，除非遇到灾荒，几年之内不应降低。耕畜、大农具是应当由合作社统一使用的；但是不必急于采用折价归公的办法，而由合作社以合理的代价租用为妥。如果社员都同意折价归公，也应当由全体社员民主商定合理的价格和办法（主要是抽作股份金的比例和摊了股份金以后剩余的部分的归还期限）。小农具以社员自带自用为原则，也不必统一归社。原为个人经营的牲畜、林木，暂时不必由合作社统一经营（以畜牧业、林业为主的生产合作社当然可以统一经营）。在办社的第一年，必须由社员分摊一部分生产资金作为全社的
  “底垫”；一般地说，合理的办法是按土地产量分摊，按劳力平均分摊的办法是不合理的。有些合作社的土地分益很少，也可以按土地和劳力各占一定比例分摊。按照规定分摊之后，部分社员多投的部分，用于本年生产的应当规定在本年收获后归还，并且应由合作社出合理的利息。对社员所积肥料和入社前整地的劳动，都应给以适当的报酬。
    对于这些直接关系到群众切身经济利益的具体政策，必须作出正确的规定，并在具体工作当中正确地执行；同时，还要向社内外广大群众正确地宣传。只有这样，合作化运动才能健康地发展，才能发挥提高生产力的作用。
    从一九五四年秋天到现在，农业合作化运动进展得比较快，如同国务院的决议中所指出的，运动的发展基本上是健康的正常的。这反映了广大农民对于合作化的热烈拥护。但是也因为进展得快了，许多干部的政策思想和工作经验的准备都不充足，同时又忙于农村中许多其他紧张的工作，所以在农民群众中间进行的关于合作化的政策教育和组织工作不够细致。许多同志只了解农业合作化的总政策，只注意了向群众宣传总政策；却不十分了解农业合作化的各项具体政策，自然也就不很注意向群众宣传这些具体政策。有些地方对具体政策虽然作了宣传解释，但宣传解释得不完整、不恰当。
    我国地区辽阔、情况复杂，农业合作化运动的普遍展开为时尚短，农业合作化的各项具体政策实施的经验还很不够。这就增加了下层实际工作中正确地掌握各项具体政策的困难。有些同志有早日建成社会主义的热情，但却缺乏实事求是的精神，因之对于合作社处理生产资料的问题作了不适当的规定，对于某些社员的实际经济利益照顾不周，这是应该迅速改正的。
    我们党所规定的国家工业化、农业合作化的总政策是完全正确的。要保证正确地执行这个总政策，就还必须正确地规定各项具体政策。只有具体政策，只了解具体政策，而没有总政策或者不了解总政策，是不能保证革命运动循着正确的方向前进的；但是只有总政策，只了解总政策，而不规定具体政策或者不了解具体政策，也不能保证革命运动健康地发展、革命目的顺利地实现。
    我们的农业生产任务十分艰巨。为了保证党的总路线的胜利，为了保证我们国家第一个五年计划的圆满实现，必须突破重重困难，完成农业生产计划。为了提高生产力，必须稳步实行社会主义改造；而社会主义改造的任何措施，却必须力求有利于提高农民群众的生产积极性，力求避免妨害农民群众的生产积极性。当前提高农民生产积极性的关键，除了改善粮食统购统销工作以外，最主要的就是严格地按照自愿互利的原则整顿巩固农业生产合作社。要切实地贯彻自愿互利原则，就必须对农业合作化运动中的一些具体政策问题作出明确的规定，并且传布到广大群众中去。
    四川省温江等县人民政府在一月间先后发出布告，向广大群众宣布农业生产合作社处理耕牛、农具、树木、猪的饲料、生产投资等项问题的具体政策。这同国务院决议中关于农业合作化方面的精神是相符合的。这种做法已经取得了良好的效果。四川各县的布告中宣布的各项政策是具体的、简要的、明确的；它把当地群众最关心的、迫切要求解决的几个问题集中起来，作出了明确的规定。有了一定的准则，在下层实际工作中不易掌握政策的困难和紊乱现象就可以克服了。用政府布告的形式郑重宣布，一方面更易于取信于民，消除某些农民的不必要的顾虑，把更多劳动农民团结起来；一方面可以更有力地打击敌人，粉碎阶级异己分子和隐蔽的反革命分子造谣破坏的阴谋。
    四川各县的布告的内容，不一定都适用于其他地区；出布告也不是向广大农民宣布具体政策的唯一方式；但是，向广大农民宣传和解释农业合作化的具体政策这件事是各地都应当做的。应当注意的是：宣传的内容应当适合各地合作化运动和社内外农民群众的思想情况，要针对当地当前存在的突出问题加以解决。一般地说，当前农村中急待解决的是劳力和土地的分红比例问题，耕畜租价或折价归公问题，生产投资问题；不同地区还有当地群众特别关心的其他问题。这些规定必须以党中央关于发展在农业生产合作社的决议的基本精神、党中央规定的农村中实行社会主义改造的根本路线、国务院关于春耕生产的决议，以及国务院和党中央发出的其他有关文件的原则为依据。各省省委和省人民委员会对各县所进行的这个工作必须加以统一的领导，给以具体的帮助。还要注意：不可只是宣布了几条政策就算完事，而要有组织地有领导地普遍地直接地向广大农民（不仅是对社员，而且要切实注意到社外群众）进行讲解和宣传，并在实际工作中把存在的具体问题加以具体解决。
    我们的目的是要把群众最关心的农业合作化运动中的几项具体政策，正确地、迅速地、广泛地、直接地传达到广大群众中去。这和宣传粮食的定产、定购、定销的政策一样，是当前极其重要的一项政治工作，是顺利开展春耕生产运动、发展农业生产的重要保证。各省各县应当无例外地把这个工作做好。
