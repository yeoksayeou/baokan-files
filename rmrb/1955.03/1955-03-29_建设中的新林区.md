The Tangwang River in the southern part of the Lesser Khingan Mountains has two tributaries – the Wuying River and the Fenglin River. Along these two rivers lies an endless expanse of dense forest. Here, there are thick, straight Korean pines, larches, and fish-scale spruces. These excellent trees account for more than 80% of the entire forest's tree species and represent one of the country's most important bases for future timber production. To fully utilize these abundant forests, surveying teams are currently engaged in intense work here. Soon, fully electrified machinery and equipment will be used here for timber production, collection, transportation, and forest tending.

The surveying work in this forestry area began last spring. The more than 70 members participating in this surveying work are mostly production personnel who do not understand surveying business, which further increases their difficulties in the surveying work. However, in order to produce timber and support national construction as soon as possible, the team members overcame all these difficulties. In July, the team where Guan Zuobin and Gao Dejin were located was tasked with completing the surveying work in the Tenth Logging Area within ten days. Because of the tight schedule and poor terrain conditions, they could not move their tents at any time. They persisted in surveying for six consecutive days and nights without returning to the camp to rest. As a result, they completed the survey task four days ahead of schedule. After more than five months of hard work, all the team members successfully completed the survey of more than 90,000 hectares of forest, as well as the surveying of dozens of kilometers of forest railway lines, tractor lines, etc. In the work, more than 30 surveying models emerged, and all the team members became skilled surveying personnel.

The Fenglin Forestry Industry Bureau currently has more than 200 employees. By the end of January, it had basically completed important production design work such as the storage yard, electrical operations, and logging area division, and made preliminary designs for the bureau's construction direction and production methods. Now, the bureau is organizing employees to learn new technologies, preparing to survey the rivers and streams in the forest, so as to use natural rivers to transport timber in the future.

    建设中的新林区
    赫重运
    小兴安岭南部的汤旺河，有两条支流——五营河和丰林河。沿着这两条河流是一望无际的茂密森林。这里有粗大笔直的红松、落叶松、鱼鳞松，这些优良树木占整个森林树种的百分之八十以上，是祖国今后生产木材的重要基地之一。为了充分的利用这些丰富的森林，现在，勘测队员们正在这里进行着紧张的劳动。不久以后，这里将使用全部电气化的机械设备，进行木材生产，集运和森林的抚育工作。
    这个林区的勘测工作，是去年春天开始的。参加这次勘测工作的七十多名队员，大都是些生产人员，不懂勘测业务，这就更增加他们在勘测工作中的困难。但是，队员们为了早日生产木材，支援国家建设，克服了所有这些困难。七月里，队上要关作宾、高德金所在的那个小队，在十天内完成第十伐木区的勘测任务，因为时间紧迫，地势条件不好，不能随时移动帐篷，他们就一连六昼夜未回宿营地休息，坚持勘测，结果提前四天完成了调查任务。全体队员们前后共经过五个多月的艰苦努力，胜利完成了九万多垧森林调查，数十公里的森林铁路线、拖拉机线等的勘测任务。在工作中涌现出了三十多名勘测模范，并且使队员们都成为熟练的勘测人员。
    丰林森林工业局现已有二百多名职工，到一月底，已基本完成了贮木场、电气作业，伐木区划分等重要生产设计工作，并作出初步的建局方向和生产方式的设计。现在，该局正在组织职工学习新技术，准备勘测森林中的河川情况，以便今后利用自然河流运输木材。
