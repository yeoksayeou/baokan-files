Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th - Roger F. Heost, a Belgian soldier who crossed the military demarcation line on August 25, 1954, and entered the military control area of the Korean-Chinese side, has obtained employment in China with the help of the Chinese Red Cross Society.

During questioning at the meeting of secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission in Panmunjom on February 11, 1955, Heost stated that he resolutely refused to return to the American side. Subsequently, he applied through the Chinese Red Cross Society for permission to come to China and arrived in Andong on February 28th. According to his wishes, the Chinese Red Cross Society introduced him to work at the Shandong Paper Mill in Jinan on March 5th. Heost expressed his gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross Society for the help it gave him and to the factory for its welcome, saying, "I now have the opportunity to start living a peaceful new life—a life of working and studying for the happiness of the majority and myself."

    一名比籍士兵不愿再回美方去
    经我红十字会介绍获得职业
    【新华社济南十七日电】一九五四年八月二十五日越过军事分界线进入朝中方面军事控制地区的比利时籍士兵罗歇·弗·贺斯特已经在中国红十字会的帮助下在中国获得了职业。
    贺斯特在一九五五年二月十一日在板门店军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上被讯问时，曾表示坚决不愿再回美方去。此后，他通过中国红十字会申请获准前来中国，并在二月二十八日到达安东。中国红十字会根据他的愿望，已在三月五日介绍他到济南山东造纸厂工作。贺斯特对中国红十字会给予他的帮助和工厂方面对他的欢迎表示感激，他说：“我现在才有可能开始过着和平的新的生活——为大多数人和自己的幸福而工作、学习的生活”。
