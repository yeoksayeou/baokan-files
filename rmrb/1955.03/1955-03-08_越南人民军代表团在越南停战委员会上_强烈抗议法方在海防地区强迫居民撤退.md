Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on Hanoi, March 5th: At the meeting of the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission in Vietnam on March 1st, the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army strongly protested the measures taken by the French Federal side to force the evacuation of residents in the Haiphong area.

The Vietnamese delegation cited General Cogniet, commander of the French Federal forces in the Haiphong area, Order No. 422 - F.T.N.V. - promulgated on December 9, 1954, as specific evidence. This order explains General Ély, High Commissioner of France in Indochina and Commander-in-Chief of the French Federal Forces, Order No. 5082 - S.P.D. - issued on November 24, 1954. This order instructed the commander of the French Federal forces in the Haiphong area to notify residents that, starting from February 1, 1955, he would no longer be responsible for the safety of the latter, and that he would designate the dates for the enforced evacuation of those who did not comply with this order. The order also pointed out that the so-called enforced evacuation meant that, in the event of serious incidents, the French military authorities would have the right to assemble and evacuate residents without prior notice, and residents would no longer enjoy the various evacuation conveniences provided before February 1.

The Vietnamese delegation cited another document, an order issued by General Cogniet on December 24, 1954, and signed by Colonel Danneff, Chief of Staff of the French Federal forces in the Haiphong area. This order stated that owners of factories and enterprises, merchants, and other citizens who voluntarily remained in Haiphong after the withdrawal of the French Federal forces should bear all the consequences of future contingencies such as confusion, conflicts, and the resurgence of hostilities. This order emphasized that the French side would not be responsible for any possible accidents.

The French Federal Forces Command also issued orders and announcements regarding evacuations in the event of heightened tension or alerts.

The Vietnamese delegation mentioned that Article 8 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Article 14(d) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam stipulate that everyone is free to decide the area in which he wishes to reside, and that Article 14(a) of the same agreement stipulates that the administration of each assembly zone shall be the responsibility of the party whose forces are to be assembled in that zone.

Therefore, the Vietnamese delegation pointed out that the French Federal side, before handing over the Haiphong area to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, could not shirk its responsibility to protect the lives and property of the residents of this area.

The Vietnamese delegation further stated that the French authorities, in violation of the above provisions, had taken every possible measure to exert mental threats on the residents of the Haiphong area. The French authorities also stated that they would forcibly evacuate those who did not comply with their orders. The above facts prove that the French authorities have seriously violated the relevant provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and the Vietnam Armistice Agreement.

After recounting several forced evacuation incidents in the Haiphong area, the Vietnamese delegation demanded that the other party ensure that everyone in the Haiphong area is free to decide the area in which he wishes to reside and to end all forced evacuation activities.

    越南人民军代表团在越南停战委员会上
    强烈抗议法方在海防地区强迫居民撤退
    【新华社六日讯】　据越南通讯社河内五日讯：越南人民军总司令部代表团在越南中央联合停战委员会三月一日的会议上，对法兰西联邦方面在海防地区所采取的强迫居民撤退的措施提出了强烈的抗议。
    越方代表团举出了海防地区的法兰西联邦部队司令戈涅将军一九五四年十二月九日公布的第四二二号命令——F·T·N·V·——作为具体的证据，这个命令说明法国驻印度支那高级专员兼法兰西联邦部队总司令埃利将军一九五四年十一月二十四日发表的第五○八二号命令——S·P·D·——，这项命令指示海防地区的法兰西联邦部队司令通告居民：从一九五五年二月一日起，他将对后者的安全不负任何责任，并且他将指定那些不遵从这个命令的人实行迫不得已的撤退的日期。这项命令还指出，所谓迫不得已的撤退是说，万一发生严重的事件，法国军事当局将有权不予事先通知即把居民集合起来撤走，而居民将不再享受二月一日以前所提供的种种撤退便利。
    越方代表团举出了另一个文件，这是戈涅将军在一九五四年十二月二十四日发布的而由海防地区法兰西联邦部队参谋长旦奈夫上校签署的一项命令。这项命令说：工厂和企业的所有人、商人及其他自愿在法兰西联邦部队撤离后仍留在海防的公民，应该担负如混乱、冲突和敌对行动的再起之类的未来的不测事件所造成的一切后果。这项命令强调说：法方将不对可能发生的意外事件负责。
    法兰西联邦部队司令部并且还发布了关于万一局势紧张或发生警戒情况时实行撤退的命令和公告。
    越方代表团提到，日内瓦会议最后宣言中的第八条和越南停止敌对行动协定中的第十四条丁款规定，每一个人都可以自由地决定他所愿意居住的地区，并且提到同一协定的第十四条甲款规定，各集结区内的行政由应集结部队于该区的一方负责管辖。
    因此，越方代表团指出，法兰西联邦方面在把海防地区移交给越南民主共和国政府以前，不能推卸保卫这个地区居民的生命和财产安全的责任。
    越方代表团又说，但是法方当局却违反上述的规定，采取了一切可能的方法来对海防地区的居民施以精神上的威胁。法方当局还说，它将强迫那些不遵守它的命令的人撤退。上述事实证明，法方当局已严重地违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言和越南停战协定中的有关的规定。
    越方代表团在追述了海防地区的若干强迫撤退事件以后，要求对方确保海防地区的每一个人都能自由地决定他所愿意居住的地区，并且终止一切强迫撤退的行为。
