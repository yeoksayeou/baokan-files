Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 21st: In Liaoning Province, demobilized construction soldiers who returned to cities and industrial and mining areas have mostly been assigned to work in factories, mines, and state organs. Those who returned to the countryside have actively engaged in agricultural production, playing a backbone role in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. According to statistics, among the demobilized construction soldiers who returned to the eleven cities and counties of Lüda, Fushun, Zhangwu, and Xinmin, over three hundred have already been elected as leaders of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and over two hundred have been elected as representatives to the People's Congresses of villages, counties (cities), and the province.

In 1954, more than three thousand demobilized construction soldiers throughout the province were selected as models in their respective positions. Demobilized construction soldier Li Chunrong, after starting work at the Longfeng Mine in Fushun in 1952, was promoted to head of the tunneling team due to his implementation of assembly line methods, which improved production efficiency. In 1954, he further improved coal transport tools, increasing work efficiency threefold. As a result, he was named a special-class labor model in Fushun City. Starting in 1952, Zhang Delong and five other demobilized construction soldiers, all members of the Chinese Communist Party, who returned to Jianwobao Village, Sixth District, Xinmin County, worked diligently, actively leading farmers on the path of mutual aid and cooperation. Zhang Delong and the other five received the honorary title of "Collective Model of Demobilized Construction Soldiers."

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 21st: Many demobilized construction soldiers in rural Yunnan Province have been elected as models in agricultural production and mutual cooperation.

Most of the demobilized construction soldiers who have returned to rural Yunnan Province since 1952 to participate in agricultural production have joined mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. In addition to their own active labor, they have united and led the masses, becoming the backbone of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places. According to statistics from twenty-seven counties, including Mengzi, Yunlong, and Zhanyi, more than two hundred and eighty demobilized construction soldiers have been named work and production models; many of them have served as township chiefs and chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives. Jiang Guiming, a first-class model demobilized construction soldier in Anle Township, Xichou County, was elected township chief shortly after his demobilization. He actively promoted the benefits of taking the path of mutual aid and cooperation, while organizing the masses to build water conservancy projects, turning many dry fields into paddy fields, inspiring farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Shan Ziwu, the Communist Party branch secretary and demobilized construction soldier of Zhendui Township, Rongfeng County, has also been honored with two special-class model titles and three first-class model titles for actively leading the people in establishing supply and marketing cooperatives and promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 22nd: The state-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company, which has been selected as a model for preferential treatment in Lüda City for three consecutive years, has once again been selected as a model for preferential treatment in Liaoning Province this year.

The state-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company regards the recruitment of revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in work as a glorious political task, and has specially established a preferential treatment committee, equipped with full-time cadres to manage preferential treatment work. Over the past few years, the company has recruited more than six hundred and thirty revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in work, and has successively assigned more than three hundred and ninety of them to the main production workshops.

The shipbuilding company assigns special personnel to adopt the "package teaching and guarantee learning" method to conduct technical theory and practical operation education for the revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers participating in work. Many skilled workers even conscientiously explain technical theories and operating procedures to them during their rest time until they have completely learned them. Xu Yuanmao, a workshop director at the shipyard, took in ten demobilized construction soldiers as apprentices in 1954. In addition to serving as their teacher himself, he also organized other skilled workers to help explain. Once, Xu Yuanmao fell ill, and he still taught while sick during his convalescence. As a result of such conscientious teaching, the ten demobilized construction soldiers became qualified skilled workers four months ahead of schedule. The company also takes great care of the lives of revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers, frequently issuing relief funds and recruiting their family members to participate in work.

The revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers who have received warm care have a high level of enthusiasm for production. In 1954, they jointly proposed eighty-three rationalization proposals, and one hundred and fifteen people received material rewards for overfulfilling production tasks, forty people were named labor models of the company, thirty people were named labor models of Zhongshan District in Lüda City, and eight people were named labor models of Lüda City.

    辽宁云南复员军人在工作中发挥模范作用
    大连造船公司把安置复员军人当作一项光荣的政治任务
    据新华社沈阳二十一日电：辽宁省的复员建设军人，凡是回到城市和工矿地区的大都被分配到工厂、矿山和国家机关中去工作；回到农村的都积极投入了农业生产，在互助合作组织中发挥了骨干作用。据统计，回到旅大、抚顺、彰武、新金等十一个市、县的复员建设军人中，现在已有三百多人被选为农业生产合作社和互助组的领导人，有二百多人被选为村、县（市）和省的人民代表大会代表。
    一九五四年全省有三千多名复员建设军人在各个岗位上被选为模范。复员建设军人李春荣一九五二年到抚顺龙凤矿工作后，由于他推行了流水作业法，提高了生产效率，一九五二年被提拔为掘进组长；一九五四年他又改进了运煤工具，提高工作效率三倍；因此，他被评为抚顺市特等劳动模范。从一九五二年开始，先后回到新民县第六区碱窝堡村的张德隆等六名复员建设军人，都是中国共产党党员，他们勤劳生产，积极带领农民走互助合作的道路。张德隆等六人获得了“复员建设军人集体模范”的光荣称号。
    据新华社昆明二十一日电：云南省农村中的许多复员建设军人当选为农业生产和互助合作方面的模范。
    从一九五二年以来陆续返回云南省农村参加农业生产的复员建设军人，大部分都参加了互助组或农业生产合作社。他们除自己积极劳动外，并团结带领群众，成了各地农业生产合作社、互助组中的骨干。据蒙自、云龙、沾益等二十七个县的统计，被评为工作、生产模范的复员建设军人就有二百八十多名；其中有许多人担任了乡长、农业生产合作社社长。西畴县安乐乡一等模范复员建设军人蒋贵明复员后不久就被群众选为乡长，他一面积极宣传走互助合作道路的好处，一面组织群众兴修水利，使许多干田变成了水田，启发了农民参加互助合作组织的积极性。榕峰县镇碓乡的共产党支部书记、复员建设军人单子文，也由于积极领导人民建立供销合作社，推动互助合作运动，而连续获得了两次特等模范、三次一等模范的光荣称号。
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】曾经连续三年被选为旅大市优抚模范的国营大连造船公司，今年又被选为辽宁省的优抚模范。
    国营大连造船公司把吸收革命残废军人、复员建设军人参加工作当作一项光荣的政治任务，专门成立了一个优抚委员会，配备专职干部管理优抚工作。几年来，这个公司共吸收了六百三十多名革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加工作，并先后把他们中的三百九十多人分配到主要的生产车间去。
    造船公司指定专人采用“包教保学”的办法，对参加工作的革命残废军人和复员建设军人进行技术理论和实际操作的教育。许多技术工人甚至在休息时间也认真向他们讲解技术理论和操作规程，直到他们完全学会为止。造船厂工段长徐元茂一九五四年接收了十名复员建设军人作徒工，他除了自己担任老师外，还组织其他技术工人帮助讲解。有一次徐元茂生了病，在休养期间还带病讲课。由于这样认真教学的结果，使十名复员建设军人提前四个月成为合乎标准等级的技术工人。公司对革命残废军人和复员建设军人的生活也极为关怀，经常发放救济费和吸收他们的家属参加工作。
    受到热诚关怀的革命残废军人和复员建设军人，生产的积极性都很高。一九五四年，他们共提出八十三件合理化建议，并有一百一十五人超额完成生产任务得到物质奖励，四十人被评为公司的劳动模范，三十人被评为旅大市中山区的劳动模范，八人被评为旅大市的劳动模范。
