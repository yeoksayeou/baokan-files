Opinions on Implementing the Policy of Streamlining and Economy in Institutions of Higher Education
Zhang Jian

In the past year, many institutions of higher education have begun to pay attention to implementing the policy of "spending less money, doing more work, and doing things well," and have achieved certain results. However, upon careful inspection, the problems are still quite serious.

First, there are the following irrational phenomena in the use of human resources: First, most schools have excessively large staffing levels, and redundant personnel have not yet been properly handled. According to the statistical report for the 1954-1955 academic year, the average staffing ratio of faculty and staff to students in national institutions of higher education is 2.82 (students) to 1 (faculty and staff). Although this is an increase of 0.25 compared to the 2.57 to 1 ratio in the 1949-1950 academic year, it has not yet met the original requirements. Admittedly, some smaller institutions (such as art, sports, agriculture, and forestry) or institutions with smaller enrollment tasks (such as finance, economics, and law) do face genuine difficulties in resolving this issue; units with overly dispersed campuses also require more personnel. However, some engineering colleges with large enrollment tasks, which could originally achieve a ratio of 3 to 1 or 3.5 to 1, have not tightened their original staffing levels, and have even increased the staffing ratio. Second, there are too many employees engaged in administrative work and too few teaching staff. Currently, among the total number of faculty and staff nationwide, employees account for approximately 57.89 percent, while teaching staff account for only 42.11 percent. While it is currently difficult to increase the number of teaching staff, the number of administrative staff can be relatively reduced.

The irrational phenomena in the use of material resources are mainly manifested as: in terms of capital construction, many schools pursue luxury and large roofs with glazed tiles, etc. Many schools want to build all the school buildings needed for the next few years within one year. They think it is too troublesome to engage in capital construction every year, and it is easier to complete it in one year, without considering how much area the state can provide, nor considering the state's funding. Some schools have spread out too much, such as the Northeast Institute of Technology and the Central China Institute of Technology, which not only use too much land, affecting agricultural production, but also cause huge waste in terms of water, electricity, heating, and sanitation engineering. Many schools are unwilling to use the original old school buildings and request to relocate to other places and rebuild all the buildings.

In terms of teaching equipment, wasteful phenomena such as blind procurement, low utilization rates, and high damage rates are also very serious. Schools still have the phenomenon of overestimating expenses when budgeting, so some schools have about 10 percent or more of their funds unspent at the end of the year.

Due to the serious accumulation, waste, and irrational phenomena in the use of human, material, and financial resources, the smooth development of higher education is affected. For example, the teaching equipment in institutions of higher education is still rudimentary (such as the fact that the professional laboratories of many institutions have not yet been equipped, and the equipment in the laboratories of ordinary basic courses is also incomplete), and the dormitories for teachers and students are relatively crowded. However, due to the improper use of funds, the problem is difficult to solve quickly and effectively.

The reasons for the above-mentioned irrational phenomena are, of course, due to the fact that the work of the schools has not yet fully gotten on track, many cadres lack management experience, and there are no clear standards for various tasks, but the main reason is that the importance of streamlining and economy is not sufficiently recognized. Some comrades tend to unilaterally emphasize the local difficulties of the school, reaching out to higher authorities for more people, more money, more area, and more equipment, without paying attention to fully exploring the school's potential to overcome difficulties. At the same time, the leadership lacks investigation and research, does not understand the situation at the lower levels, and gives more people, money, area, and equipment to the schools that complain the loudest; they lack in-depth inspection of whether the use of human, material, and financial resources in the schools is reasonable. This has fostered the departmentalism that only considers the needs of one's own school and disregards the overall interests of the state.

How should the policy of streamlining and economy be implemented in the future? I think we should start from the following aspects:

First, promote a simple and economical atmosphere. If all schools can do this, they can save a large amount of funds for the state every year. For example, in capital construction, the Northeast People's University has implemented the policy of "suitability, economy, and appropriately paying attention to aesthetics under permitted conditions," thereby ensuring teaching needs and saving a large amount of funds. Also, institutions such as Shanghai Jiao Tong University have paid attention to streamlining personnel in the use of human resources, making staffing levels more rational (the ratio of faculty and staff to students at Shanghai Jiao Tong University is 3.84 to 1, Fudan University is 3.27 to 1, and Shanghai Second Medical College is 3.44 to 1). Sichuan Medical College has established strict systems for the management and use of materials and school property; it has stipulated specific methods for the consumption of water and electricity, and conducts inspections and supervision; it has come up with various good methods to improve students' meals. Therefore, the school's expenses for teaching administration and other expenses are lower than those of other schools in Chengdu. Furthermore, Dalian Institute of Technology has fully utilized existing materials to manufacture instruments needed for the physics laboratory, saving the state a lot of teaching equipment costs.

Second, in accordance with the different nature of various types of schools, the setting of majors, the size of the school, and the environment in which they are located (urban or suburban, dispersed or concentrated), as well as the quality of the original foundation, gradually formulate budget standards for various expenses, area quotas for various types of buildings, teaching equipment standards, staffing ratios for various types of schools, and specific methods for implementing these regulations.

Third, before uniform quota standards are formulated, all schools should pay attention to fully exploring potential forces. For example, regarding the use of classrooms and laboratories, we can consider trying to divide students into two groups and implement afternoon and morning classes to improve the utilization rate of teaching buildings. For example, the dining hall can implement a method of eating in two batches, which can allow a cafeteria that accommodates 1,000 people to serve 2,000 people. For old school buildings, all those that can be used with slight repairs should be fully utilized. At the same time, all schools can consider using existing school buildings to run night universities. As long as all schools think of more ways, they will definitely be able to save a batch of funds for the country. Regarding teaching equipment, it is necessary to carry out necessary and rational adjustments between various departments within the school or between schools to fully utilize the existing instruments and equipment. Secondly, necessary inspections should also be carried out on the existing staffing levels of the schools, and three people should not be placed where two people can do the job. At the same time, in order to give full play to the strength of the teaching staff, all schools can consider trying to run correspondence departments to help working cadres improve their scientific and technological level and business capabilities. Schools should find ways to deal with redundant personnel that can be handled. Redundant personnel that are temporarily difficult to handle can be listed outside the staffing level, and suggestions for proper handling in the future should be submitted to higher authorities. For financial management, it is necessary to continue to implement the instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education, and the president should strengthen unified leadership over the school's financial work. At the same time, efforts should be made to change the practice of overestimating expenses when budgeting and decentralized management, ensure that the state's original budget targets are not broken, and leave a certain amount of reserve funds as much as possible to prepare for emergencies.

Fourth, the Ministry of Higher Education and relevant central business departments should regard urging their affiliated institutions of higher education to vigorously implement the policy of streamlining and economy as one of the important tasks this year. They should conduct planned key inspections of their affiliated schools. If any accumulation or waste is found, necessary measures should be taken to correct it. For example, after the People's Daily exposed the phenomenon that the construction project budget of Harbin Institute of Technology exceeded the actual budget by 39 percent on February 6, the First Ministry of Machine Building should conduct the necessary inspection to promote the school leadership's attention. Those schools that vigorously implement the policy of streamlining and economy and have achieved results should be promptly commended, and their experiences should be introduced to provide learning for various schools.

    对高等学校执行精简节约方针的意见
    张健
    近一年来，许多高等学校已经开始注意执行“少花钱、多办事、把事办好”的精简节约方针，并已获得一定的成绩。但是，认真检查起来，问题还是比较严重的。
    首先，在人力使用上存在着下列不合理现象：第一，多数学校人员编制过大，冗员至今尚未妥善地加以处理。根据一九五四——一九五五年学年度报表统计，全国高等学校现有教职员工和学生的编制比例平均是二·八二（学生）比一（教职员工），这虽然较之一九四九——一九五○年学年度的二·五七比一已经提高了零点二五；但是，还没有达到原定要求。诚然，有些规模小的院校（如艺术、体育、农林等）或招生任务较小的院校（如财经、政法），在解决这一问题时确实也有困难；校舍过于分散的单位用人也要多些；不过有些招生任务很大的工科院校，原本可以达到三比一或三·五比一的，却没有紧缩原有的编制，甚至提高了编制比例。第二，从事行政工作的职工过多，教学人员过少。现在全国教职员工总人数中，职工约占百分之五十七·八九，教学人员仅占百分之四十二·一一。教学人员目前固然难于增加，但行政人员是可以相对地减少的。
    在物力使用上的不合理现象，主要表现是：在基本建设方面不少学校追求豪华以及琉璃瓦的大屋顶等等。许多学校想在一年内就修建好今后数年内所需的全部校舍，他们认为年年都搞基本建设太麻烦，不如一年完工省事，没有考虑到国家能给多少面积，也没有考虑到国家的经费。有的学校摊子铺得很大，例如东北工学院和华中工学院，不但用地太多，影响农业生产，而且在水、电、暖汽、卫生工程方面造成了巨大耗费。许多学校不愿利用原有的旧校舍，要求迁校到别的地方，重新建筑全部用房。
    在教学设备方面，盲目采购、利用率低、损坏率大等浪费现象也很严重。学校对于经费仍有宽打窄用的现象，因而有些学校到年终约有百分之十以上的经费用不完。
    由于在人力、物力和财力使用上，存在着严重的积压浪费和不合理的现象，使高等教育事业的顺利发展受到影响。例如，目前高等学校的教学设备还是简陋的（如许多院校的专业试验室尚未装备起来，普通基础课的试验室的设备也不齐全），师生的宿舍较为拥挤。但由于经费用之不当，使问题难于迅速有效地解决。
    造成上述种种不合理的现象的原因，固然是由于学校的工作尚未完全走上轨道，许多干部缺乏管理经验，各项工作还没有明确的标准，但主要还是由于对精简节约的重要性认识不足。有些同志往往只片面地强调学校的局部困难，伸手向上级多要人、多要钱、多要面积和设备，而未注意充分发掘学校潜力来克服困难。同时，在领导方面则缺乏调查研究，不了解下情，那个学校叫得厉害些，就多给些人、钱、面积和设备；对于学校人力、物力和财力的使用是否合理，则缺乏深入的检查。这样就助长了只顾本校需要不顾国家整体利益的本位主义思想。
    今后怎样贯彻精简节约的方针呢？我以为应当从下列几方面着手：
    第一，提倡简朴、节省的风气。假如各校都能这样做的话，每年可以为国家节省大批经费。例如，东北人民大学在基本建设中，贯彻了“适用、经济、在条件许可下适当地讲究美观”的方针，从而既保证了教学需要，又节省了大量的经费。又如上海交通大学等院校，在人力使用上注意精简人员，使编制趋于合理（上海交通大学教职员工和学生的比例是三·八四比一，复旦大学是三·二七比一，上海第二医学院是三·四四比一）。四川医学院对物资、校产的管理、使用，建立了严格的制度；对于水电的消耗，规定了具体办法，并进行检查和监督；在改善学生的伙食方面想了各种较好的办法。因此，这个学校的教学行政费及其他费用的开支，比成都其他各校都要节省。又如大连工学院充分利用原有的材料来制造物理试验室所需的仪器，为国家节省了不少教学设备费。
    第二，要根据各类不同性质的学校和专业设置情况、学校规模的大小和所处环境（市区或郊区、分散或集中）以及原有基础的好坏，逐步地拟定各项经费预算标准、各类用房的面积定额、教学设备标准，各类学校人员编制比例等项规定以及执行这些规定的具体办法。
    第三，在统一的定额标准未拟好之前，各校应当注意充分发掘潜在力量。例如，关于教室和试验室的使用，可以考虑试行把学生分成二部，实行上下午排课的办法，以提高教学用房的利用率。又如饭厅可以实行分两批轮流吃饭的办法，这就可以使容纳一千人的食堂供两千人使用。对于旧的校舍，凡是能稍加修缮即可使用的都要充分利用。同时，各校还可以考虑利用现有校舍办理夜大学。只要各校多想些办法，一定能够为国家节省一批经费。关于教学设备，要在校内各系或校际间进行必要的合理调整，以充分发挥现有仪器设备的作用。其次，对于学校现有的人员编制，也要进行必要的检查，凡是两个人能做的事就不要放上三个人。同时为充分发挥师资力量，各校可以考虑试办函授部，帮助在职干部提高科学技术水平和业务能力。对于能够处理的冗员，学校就设法处理。暂时不易处理的冗员，可以列在编制以外，并向上级提出今后妥善处理的意见。对于财务管理，要继续贯彻高等教育部的指示，校长应加强对于学校财务工作的统一领导。同时要努力改变宽打窄用和分散管理的办法，保证不突破国家原定的预算指标，尽可能留出一定的预备费，以备偶发事件之需。
    第四，高等教育部和中央有关业务部门，应把督促所属高等学校大力贯彻精简节约方针当作今年的重要工作之一。要对所属学校有计划地进行重点检查，如发现有积压浪费现象，应采取必要的措施加以纠正。例如，人民日报在二月六日揭发了哈尔滨工业大学建筑工程概算超过实际预算百分之三十九的现象，第一机械工业部就应该进行必要的检查，以促使学校领导方面的注意。对于那些大力贯彻精简节约的方针而有成绩的学校，应当及时加以表扬，介绍它们的经验，提供各校学习。
