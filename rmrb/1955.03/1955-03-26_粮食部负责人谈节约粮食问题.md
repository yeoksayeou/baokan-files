The person in charge of the Ministry of Food discussed the issue of saving food.
[This newspaper dispatch] On March 23, this reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Ministry of Food on the issue of saving food in the grain system. He gave the following opinions to the reporter:

Since the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, it has been supported by the people of the whole country and has achieved great results. The system of unified purchase and sale is being gradually improved, and the phenomenon of wasting grain has been greatly reduced compared with the past, which should be affirmed. However, the national grain system still generally has varying degrees of waste of grain in business links such as supply, allocation, storage, and processing due to lax control of the system and poor management.

In the grain supply work, grain waste is manifested in the following aspects: First, because the grain consumption plans of institutions and organizations have not been well reviewed, some units falsely report the number of people and purchase more than they should. For example, from October to mid-November last year, the No. 8 Engineering Company of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, falsely reported more than 1,500 employees and purchased more than 36,000 jin of flour. Second, the review of residents' grain purchase certificates is not strict enough, and the supervision and inspection of private grain-using industries are insufficient, resulting in some unscrupulous merchants and backward elements arbitrarily buying grain. For example, in December 1954, 14 cases of altering and borrowing grain purchase certificates were found in Xinfu District, Fushun City, Liaoning Province. A preliminary inspection in the Fifth District of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, showed that 5 out of 10 soy sauce and vinegar manufacturers had hoarding behavior. Third, private consignment stores and cooperative consignment stores are not well supervised and inspected, resulting in large losses. For example, in Lyujiadian and other nine distribution points in Nanyuan District, Beijing, more than 4,400 jin of grain were inedible due to mold, rat bites, and insect damage.

In the process of allocation and transportation, the phenomenon of discarding grain is also serious. In January of this year, a batch of wheat was transported from Luoyang to Beijing. Because the carriages were not cleaned, the discarded grain was mixed with coal ash, totaling more than 800 jin.

In storage work, grain losses are also caused by poor quality of incoming grain, high moisture content, many impurities, poor storage, and lax storage systems. For example, from January to October last year, a total of 97 mold incidents occurred in Heilongjiang Province, with 5.47 million jin of moldy or deteriorated grain, of which 20,000 jin were absolute losses.

In processing and production, some processing plants do not pay attention to the rate of finished products, and the cleaning of by-products is not done well, and the phenomenon of "bran containing flour" in flour processing and "husk containing grain" and "fine bran containing rice" in rice and miscellaneous grain processing often occurs, resulting in waste of grain. When the Tangshan City Grain Bureau's directly affiliated processing plant milled millet in June last year, the bran contained 2.4% rice, the fine bran contained 10% rice, and the last bran contained as much as 66% rice. In addition, some processing plants do not pay attention to storage, the broken rice rate is too high, and grain is arbitrarily discarded during loading and unloading, which also wastes a lot of grain.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Food emphasized: The grain department manages the country's precious wealth - grain, and should cherish grain and resolutely oppose wasting grain. He put forward the following suggestions on how to save grain in the links of supply, allocation, storage and processing:

In terms of supply: For the supply of urban residents, relevant departments should be coordinated to further verify the population, understand and grasp the grain consumption of residents, strengthen the planning of supply work, and prevent arbitrary purchases. For institutions and organizations, grain purchase plans should be carefully reviewed and key inspections should be carried out to prevent false reporting. The grain consumption of various industries should be controlled in coordination with industry, commerce and taxation departments, based on the normal needs of urban economic life. At the same time, substitutes can be gradually promoted for the raw materials required by the brewing and non-staple food industries. Strengthen strict supervision and inspection of consignment stores.

In terms of allocation and transportation: Improve the method of sewing the mouths of sacks, promote the method of sewing bags with live knots, and strictly prohibit sewing the mouths with sackcloth and straw ropes. In the loading and unloading links, loading, unloading, and warehousing should be done quickly to avoid losses caused by grain being stored on vehicles, ships, or at stations and docks for too long in the past. Educate grain-transporting masses to cherish grain and improve their sense of responsibility. Do a good job in cleaning and sanitation of transportation equipment and clean up spilled grain on vehicles and ships.

In terms of storage: Vigorously carry out prevention and control of insects, mold, rats, and birds, and establish and improve various systems. Especially now that the rainy season is approaching, grain depots at all levels should step up inspections and deal with dangerous grain in a timely manner to reduce losses. Do a good job in warehouse safety and security, and do a good job in preventing special incidents, fire prevention, and theft prevention. Do a good job in the management of receiving, drying, and handling. Before warehousing, mobilize farmers to dry and clean the grain and sell good grain, and strive to ensure that the quality of the grain entering the warehouse meets the standards.

In terms of processing: Vigorously promote advanced experience, continue to implement the "separate grinding and screening" method for wheat processing and the "separate grain processing, rapid light grinding" method for rice processing, and strengthen the cleaning of by-products. Improve technology and increase the rate of finished products while ensuring the quality of finished products. Strengthen the inspection and testing of machinery and equipment, and strengthen the inspection and testing of raw grain and processed grain. In areas where there is a habit of processing steamed rice, steamed rice can continue to be processed and supplied.

Finally, the person in charge of the Ministry of Food also called on all employees of the national grain system to better assume the responsibility of protecting grain, strictly implement various systems, resolutely fight against irresponsible and wasteful phenomena, and hoped that party committees, organs, schools, and organizations in various places would mobilize widely and deeply to make all employees and the broad masses of people strive to save grain and support the country's socialist industrialization.

    粮食部负责人谈节约粮食问题
    【本报讯】本报记者在三月二十三日就粮食系统节约粮食问题，访问粮食部负责人，他对记者发表意见如下：
    国家实行粮食统购统销政策以来，获得全国人民的拥护，已取得巨大的成绩；统购统销制度正在逐步改进，浪费粮食的现象较前大为减少，这是应该肯定的。但是，全国粮食系统在供应、调运、保管、加工等业务环节上，由于掌握制度不严，经营管理不善，还普遍有不同程度的浪费粮食现象。
    在粮食供应工作中，粮食浪费表现在这几方面：一、因为没有很好地审查机关团体的用粮计划，因而有的单位虚报人数，多购冒领。如山西太原市第八工程公司去年十月到十一月中，就虚报职工一千五百多人，多购面粉三万六千多斤；二、对居民购粮证审查不严，对私营用粮行业监督检查不够，因而发生某些奸商与落后分子任意套购现象。如辽宁抚顺市新抚区一九五四年十二月份就发现涂改和借用购粮证套购事件十四起，河北唐山市第五区初步检查，在十户酱醋制造业中就有五户有囤积行为；三、对私营代销店、合作社代销店没有很好实行监督检查，因此损耗很大。如北京南苑区吕家店等九个分销处就有四千四百多斤粮食，因为霉坏、鼠咬、虫蚀而不能食用。
    在调运过程中，抛撒粮食的现象也是严重的。今年一月由洛阳运来北京一批小麦，因车厢没有清扫，抛撒的粮食和煤渣混在一起，约有八百多斤。
    在保管工作中，由于入库粮食质量差、水分高、杂质多，保管不善和仓储制度不严，也造成粮食的损失。如黑龙江省去年一至十月共发生霉变事故九十七次，霉坏或变质粮食五百四十七万斤，其中绝对损失者就有二万斤。
    在加工生产中，有些加工厂不重视出品率，对副产品清理工作做得不够，经常发生面粉加工中“麸皮含粉”和大米、杂粮加工中“糠壳含谷”“细糠含米”等浪费粮食的现象。河北唐山市粮食局直属加工厂去年六月碾制糜子米时，皮糠内含米百分之二点四，细糠内含米百分之十，最后一道糠含米竟有百分之六十六。此外某些加工厂不重视保管，碎米率过高，上机和包装起卸中随意抛撒，也浪费很多的粮食。
    粮食部负责人强调指出：粮食部门经营着国家的宝贵财富——粮食，应该十分珍惜粮食，坚决反对浪费粮食。他对供应、调运、保管、加工等环节上节约粮食的办法，提出以下意见：
    在供应方面：对城市居民的供应，应配合有关部门进一步核实人口，了解掌握居民粮食消费情况，加强供应工作的计划性，防止任意套购；对机关团体应认真审核购粮计划，进行重点检查，防止浮报冒领；对用粮行业应配合工商、税务部门，根据城市经济生活的正常需要，加以控制；同时，对酿造和副食品行业所需原料，可逐步推广代用品；加强对代销店的严格监督检查。
    在调运方面：改进麻袋缝口方法，推行活扣缝包法，严禁用麻皮、草索缝口；在装卸环节上，要快装、快卸、快入仓，避免过去常因粮食在车船上或车站、码头上停放过久，造成损失；教育运粮群众，爱惜粮食，提高责任心；要做好运输工具的清洁卫生工作，清扫车辆、船只上漏下的粮食。
    在保管方面：大力开展对虫、霉、鼠、雀的防治工作，建立和健全各项制度。特别是目前已到霉雨季节，各级粮仓应加紧检查，及时处理危粮，以减少损失；做好仓库安全保卫工作，做好防特、防火、防盗工作；做好接收、整晒、搬运的管理工作；入库前动员农民晒干扬净，交售好粮，力求入仓粮质合乎标准。
    在加工方面：大力推广先进经验，继续贯彻小麦加工“分磨分筛”和大米加工“分粒加工、快速轻碾”方法，并加强副产品的清理工作；在保证成品质量的前提下，改进技术，提高出品率；加强机器设备的检查测定工作，和加强对原粮和加工粮的检验化验工作；在有加工蒸谷米习惯的地区，可以继续加工供应蒸谷米。
    粮食部负责人最后还号召全国粮食系统全体职工，更好地负起保护粮食的责任，严格地执行各项制度，坚决地向不负责任和浪费粮食的现象作不懈的斗争，并希望各地党委、机关、学校及团体广泛而深入地动员，使全体职工及广大群众努力节约粮食，支援国家社会主义工业化。
