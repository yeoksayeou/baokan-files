Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: The House of Representatives of the Diet held a plenary session on the 24th, and opposition party members questioned the Hatoyama government on foreign policy issues.

    Labor-Farmer Party member Hisao Ishino charged in his questioning that the United States had "threatened to freeze assets in the United States and exert other pressures" in order to prevent Japanese companies from cooperating with China in the upcoming trade negotiations. Ishino demanded that the Hatoyama government fulfill its promises made during the election campaign to develop trade with China and protect Japanese industry. Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said in response to the questioning that promoting trade between Japan and China was the Hatoyama government's established policy, and in this sense, he welcomed the visit of the Chinese trade delegation to Japan. However, he also stated that Japan was only prepared to trade with China within the scope of "embargo" restrictions.

    Shigemitsu said that negotiations for the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would be conducted under the principle of Japan's peaceful foreign policy. He said that the Soviet Union's proposal to hold negotiations with Japan for the normalization of relations between the two countries was sincere. He believed that as long as the Japanese side was sincere, the upcoming normalization negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union would achieve good results. He also said that the Japanese government would "fully consider" Japan's relations with the United States in improving relations with China and the Soviet Union. He stated that Japan's negotiations with the Soviet Union would begin after close contact with Washington.

    Opposition party members raised fierce questions about Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama's recent remarks about not opposing the United States storing atomic weapons in Japan, and demanded that he assure the people that foreign countries would not be allowed to store atomic weapons in Japan. Ichiro Hatoyama avoided clarifying his attitude on this issue directly. In answering other questions, Ichiro Hatoyama explained that his government intends to request the United States to return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands at an early date.

    This questioning was the first time the House of Representatives, newly elected in the recent general election, questioned the government's policies. A Kyodo News Agency report on the 22nd pointed out that the attitude of the Hatoyama cabinet towards China, the Soviet Union, and the United States is attracting attention from all sides, as this "will show the government's true intentions regarding the so-called 'two-sided diplomacy'."

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese opposition party members criticized the Hatoyama government's attempt to amend the constitution and support for the US atomic war policy at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 26th.

    Right-wing Socialist Party member Tetsu Katayama pointed out in his questioning that "the people believe that the Democratic Party cabinet is more active and more reactionary than the Yoshida cabinet in terms of rearmament and constitutional revision." He demanded that Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama state his attitude towards the peace clause of the constitution. Hatoyama replied that he wanted to amend the current constitution when the "opportunity arises," and first to amend Article 9, which stipulates the renunciation of war.

    Katayama severely criticized Ichiro Hatoyama's intention to amend the constitution. He also opposed Ichiro Hatoyama's support for the US atomic war policy. He pointed out that "storing atomic and hydrogen bombs in Japan is a violation of the constitution."

    Japanese Communist Party member Kanichi Kawakami demanded in his questioning that Ichiro Hatoyama absolutely refuse to provide Japan to the United States as an atomic base.

    Right-wing Socialist Party member Ryoichi Oka demanded that Hatoyama retract his recent remarks about not opposing the United States storing atomic weapons in Japan.

    日本在野党议员就外交政策质询鸠山政府
    抨击鸠山企图修改宪法和支持美国原子战争政策
   【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：国会众议院在二十四日举行全体会议，在野党议员就外交政策问题对鸠山政府提出了质询。
    劳农党议员石野久男在质询中指责说，美国为了阻止日本公司在即将举行的贸易谈判中与中国合作，已“威胁要冻结在美国的资产并且施加其他压力”。石野久男要求鸠山政府实现它在选举运动中所作出的诺言，发展与中国的贸易和保护日本工业。外务相重光葵在回答质询时说：促进日本同中国的贸易是鸠山政府的既定政策，在这种意义上，他欢迎中国贸易代表团访问日本。但是他同时又表示日本只准备在“禁运”限制的范围内同中国进行贸易。
    重光葵说：日本和苏联关系正常化的谈判将在日本的和平外交政策的原则下进行。他说：苏联建议同日本举行两国关系正常化谈判是真诚的。他认为：只要日本方面是真诚的，日苏两国将要举行的关系正常化谈判就会取得良好的结果。他又说：日本政府在改善和中、苏的关系方面将“充分考虑”日本和美国的关系。他表示日本和苏联的谈判要在和华盛顿进行了密切的联系之后开始。
    在野党议员对首相鸠山一郎最近关于不反对美国在日本储存原子武器的谈话提出了激烈的质问，并且要他向人民保证不允许外国在日本储存原子武器。鸠山一郎避不正面澄清他对这个问题的态度。在回答其他一些问题时，鸠山一郎说明他的政府打算要求美国早日归还冲绳和小笠原群岛。
    这次质询是最近大选产生的众议院第一次对政府的政策提出质询。鸠山内阁已面临着舆论提出的履行它在大选时作的诺言的要求。共同社二十二日的消息指出：鸠山内阁在对中、苏两国和对美国的关系方面究竟将采取什么态度，正受到各方面的注意，因为这“将表明政府对所谓‘两面外交’的真实意图”。
   【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本反对党议员二十六日在众议院预算委员会抨击鸠山政府企图修改宪法和支持美国原子战争政策。
    右派社会党议员片山哲在质询中指出，“国民认为民主党内阁对于重整军备和修改宪法比吉田内阁更为积极，更为反动。”他要求首相鸠山一郎表明对宪法的和平条款的态度。鸠山答复说，他要在“机会到来时”修改现行宪法，并且首先要修改规定弃绝战争的第九条。
    片山哲严厉指责鸠山一郎的这种修改宪法的意图。他并且反对鸠山一郎支持美国的原子战争政策。他指出，“在日本储存原子弹和氢弹是违反宪法的”。
    日本共产党议员川上贯一在质询中要求鸠山一郎绝对拒绝把日本提供给美国作为原子基地。
    右派社会党议员冈良一要求鸠山撤销他不久以前的关于不反对美国在日本储存原子武器的谈话。
