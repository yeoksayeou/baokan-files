Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 24th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke at a public gathering for the cornerstone laying ceremony at the Allahabad train station on the evening of March 22nd, stating that the upcoming Asian-African Conference will be an event of historical significance because, for the first time, free Asian and African countries will gather to discuss issues of mutual concern.

He said that Western countries might not like it, because they have been deciding our fate for a long time. He also said that whether they like it or not, this event is inevitable.

Nehru said that he could not say now what will happen at the conference, but it will certainly provide the participants with the opportunity to understand each other. The conference will represent the awakening of Asia and Africa after two hundred years of rule and exploitation by Western countries.
