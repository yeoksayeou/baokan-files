    Let the Motherland's Forests Stay Young Forever
    By Our Reporter Jin Yukun
    From the Greater Khingan Mountains in western Heilongjiang Province to the foothills of Changbai Mountain in the southeast, there are three vast forest regions: the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the Wanda Mountains. In this boundless sea of trees, there are beautiful red pines that have grown for hundreds of years, as well as ash and cork trees used to make machinery, maple used to make musical instruments, and rosewood with beautiful patterns suitable for architectural decoration. These are all precious wood species.
    This is a treasure trove of resources for the motherland. However, the barbarous plunder and destruction by reactionary rulers of the past have left countless wounds on this treasure trove. According to statistics, in the forests of Heilongjiang Province, 8.5 million hectares have been destroyed and become barren mountains, bald ridges, and scattered forests.
    Since 1950, the forestry departments of Heilongjiang Province have been carrying out arduous nurturing and regeneration work on these logged mountains. For the first time in history, forests have been regarded as an important national asset to be protected, its wounds healed, so that barren mountains and bald ridges can gradually be transformed into dense and verdant forests. Following the suggestions of Soviet forestry experts, the forestry departments have established fifteen forest management organizations – forest management stations – in the Lesser Khingan Mountains and Wanda Mountains forest areas for forest nurturing and regeneration.
    Groups of young foresters, carrying their bags, have rushed into the depths of the forests, using a few thatched cottages as offices and dormitories. They climb mountains and cross ridges, tirelessly searching for superior tree species, clearing away burnt, dead, and wind-blown tree trunks and branches, and then establishing forest nurseries to carry out sowing, seedling cultivation, and seedling planting. Now the scale of operations of the management stations is growing day by day. The Shenshu Management Station now has more than 200 people, including many trained forest cultivation technicians, and has established meteorological and soil research institutions, beginning to carry out scientific guidance for nurturing and regeneration work. The result of these forest builders' hard work over the past few years is that 76,000 hectares of forest land have been nurtured and regenerated into forests, and the area of forest land under management has reached 450,000 hectares.
    In the mountainous areas on the edges of the vast forests where the state does not yet have the strength to carry out nurturing and regeneration, the vast number of farmers have been relied upon to close off mountains for forest cultivation over the past few years. The effect of this work is also very significant. Forty-four counties across the province have closed off 550,000 hectares of mountain land for cultivation, and most areas have now grown into young forests, with the smallest trees taller than a person. In the Qing'an, Tongbei, and Suihua areas in western Heilongjiang Province, spanning hundreds of miles, trees have now rapidly grown into dense forests several people high. In the summer, on the road from Harbin to Mudanjiang, one can see dense small poplar trees growing on the barren mountains, presenting a pleasant green scene. Once young forests grow, they need to be nurtured like infants. Since last year, Heilongjiang Province has been systematically carrying out mass nurturing and management work through agricultural and forestry cooperative organizations. The Kaidao Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative in Shangzhi County has nurtured more than 50 hectares of forest land, afforested more than 7 hectares, and cultivated more than 30,000 seedlings; the nurturing process has also cleared out some timber, increasing the cooperative's income by one-fold.
    However, the forest nurturing and regeneration work of the past few years is only a beginning, and the tasks ahead are even more arduous.
    The state is now carrying out a comprehensive plan for the forests of Heilongjiang Province, which is a huge plan for comprehensive forest management. Many forest survey teams are conducting detailed surveys in the vast forests on timber reserves, soil, climate, tree growth, and other conditions, and then will carry out overall design. This design will divide the forests into forest compartments, establish hundreds of forest management stations, and establish a comprehensive transportation network, telephone communication network, watchtowers, forest fire prevention teams, etc. With this, forestry new villages will soon be built in the forests, and shops and schools will be opened. Forest management stations will fully undertake the responsibilities of nurturing and regeneration, forest fire prevention, and supervision of logging (previously only responsible for nurturing and regeneration).
    This year, Heilongjiang Province will establish thirteen management stations in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area in order to gradually bring nurturing and regeneration work in line with logging work. In the undeveloped Greater Khingan Mountains (Heilongjiang Province section) forest area, six to ten forest management stations will be established. The efforts of forest nurturers will keep the motherland's forests young forever; will continuously expand forest resources. Fifteen years later, in the forests nurtured and regenerated in Heilongjiang Province, the area available for industrial logging will reach 2 million hectares, and the area of forests that can conserve water and soil and improve the climate after nurturing and regeneration will reach 1 million hectares. The proportion of the province's forest area to the province's land area will increase from the current 24 percent to 32 percent.

    让祖国森林青春常在
    本报记者　金雨困
    从黑龙江省西部的大兴安岭到东南部的长白山麓，有着大、小兴安岭和完达山脉三个广阔的林区。在这茫茫无际的树海中，有着生长数百年的美丽的红松，还有制造器械用的水曲柳和黄菠萝、制造乐器用的色木、花纹美丽适于建筑装饰用的紫檀。这些都是珍贵的木种。
    这是祖国的一个资源宝库。可是历代反动统治者野蛮的掠夺和破坏，给这个宝库留下了无数的创伤。据统计，在黑龙江省的森林中，遭受破坏而成荒山秃岭和散生林的，已有八百五十万公顷。
    黑龙江省林业部门自一九五○年开始，就在这些采伐过的山地上进行艰巨的抚育更新工作。历史上第一次把森林当作国家的重要财富来加以保护，医治它的创伤，以便使荒山秃岭逐渐变成稠密苍翠的大森林。按照苏联林业专家的建议，林业部门已在小兴安岭和完达山脉两个林区，建立了十五个森林抚育更新的机构——森林经营所。
    一群群年青的育林工作者背着行囊跑进了森林深处，几间草房做了办公室兼宿舍。他们爬山越岭、不辞劳苦地去寻找优良的树种，将火烧的、枯死的、风吹倒的树干和枝桠清理干净，然后建立起林间苗圃，进行播苗、育苗、栽苗的工作。现在经营所的工作规模一天一天大起来了。神树经营所现已有二百多人，其中已培养了许多育林技术人才，建立了气象和土壤的研究机构，开始进行抚育更新的科学指导工作。这些森林建设者几年来辛勤工作的结果是：有七万六千顷的林地已抚育更新成林，着手经营的林地面积已达四十五万公顷。
    在国家还没有力量来进行抚育更新的大森林的山缘地方，几年来就依靠广大农民进行封山育林。这个工作的效果也是很显著的。全省四十四个县共封边育林五十五万公顷，现在大部地区已长成幼林，最小的树木也比人高了。在黑龙江省的西部的庆安、通北、绥化等数百里的地区，现在树木都已迅速地成长为几人高的稠密的森林了。夏天，在哈尔滨往牡丹江去的路上，可以看到荒山上已长起密密的小杨树，呈现一片令人愉快的绿色。幼林长起来了，就需要像对幼儿一样地加以抚育。从去年开始，黑龙江省已通过农林合作组织有计划地开展了群众性的抚育经营工作。尚志县开道村农林牧生产合作社已抚育林地五十多公顷、造林七公顷多、育苗三万多株；在抚育中还清理出了一些木材，使合作社的收入也增加了一倍。
    但是，过去几年的森林抚育更新工作仅仅是一个开端，今后的任务是更加艰巨了。
    现在国家正在对黑龙江省的森林进行通盘规划，这是一个规模巨大的全面经营森林的计划。许多森林调查队正在大森林中详细地调查木材蓄积量、土壤、气候、树木生长等情况，然后将进行总体设计。这个设计将把森林划为一块一块的林班区，设立数百个森林经营所，建立四通八达的交通网，电话通讯网、瞭望台、护林防火队等。随着，森林中即将兴建起林业新村，开设商店和学校。森林经营所将全面地担负起抚育更新、护林防火和监督采伐工作（过去只管抚育更新）的责任。
    今年黑龙江省将在小兴安岭林区建立十三个经营所，以便使抚育更新工作逐步跟上采伐工作。在尚未开发的大兴安岭（黑龙江省部分）林区，将设六至十个森林经营所。森林抚育工作者的努力，将使祖国的森林青春常在；将使森林资源不断扩大。十五年后，在黑龙江省抚育更新的森林中，可供工业采伐的面积将达二百万公顷，经过抚育更新后可以保持水土和改善气候的森林面积将达一百万公顷，全省的森林面积占全省土地面积的比例将由现在的百分之二十四增加到百分之三十二。
