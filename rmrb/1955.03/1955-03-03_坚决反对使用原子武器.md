Currently, there exist two distinct camps in the world: the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the completely opposing aggressive camp headed by American imperialism. These two different camps pursue two different paths in all matters. The peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union aims to create an infinitely better life for humanity through its own hard work; while the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism aims to plunder the fruits of others' labor to maintain the huge profits of a few rich people.

For this reason, there are also two different approaches to the use of atomic energy. One approach is to use the great invention of human hard work—atomic energy—for peaceful purposes to create a better life for humanity, a goal proven by the indisputable fact of the atomic power plant established not long ago by the Soviet Union, the pioneer of world civilization. The other approach is to use the fruits of human hard work to harm the vast working people themselves, in order to maintain the aggressive goals of a few billionaires who plunder the fruits of others' labor.

The kind and hardworking people of the world, based on their own experiences, always yearn for a peaceful and happy life, resolutely oppose aggressive wars, and especially oppose the use of atomic weapons that massively destroy humanity with great anger. The appeal issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on January 19 to launch a large-scale signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons worldwide fully represents this good wish of the people of the world. The vigorous signature campaign that has now been launched in every corner of the world is the best example. The people of the world are fully determined to bring the plotters of atomic war to failure.

Like all kind people in the world, the Chinese people have consistently pursued a policy of opposing aggression and defending peace, and they understand that only by opposing aggression can they defend peace. Therefore, they will never allow American imperialists to invade their peaceful construction and occupy their territory. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and defend the peaceful construction of the motherland. This is their unshakeable determination. The atomic blackmail policy implemented by the American imperialists has aroused the unparalleled anger of the Chinese people. The resolution made at the joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace on February 12, 1955, on launching a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons is the just voice of the more than 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese people will, as they have done in history, prove with practical actions that this just voice of theirs is by no means empty talk.

The Tibetan people, like the people of all fraternal nationalities in the country, love their happy life. At the same time, they deeply understand that this happy life is bestowed by the united and friendly motherland family and brought about by world peace. Any infringement on world peace and the motherland family is also an infringement on the Tibetan people. Therefore, the Tibetan people are always watching the maintenance of world peace and waiting for every call from the motherland. Liberating Taiwan is also the determination of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people also firmly believe in Buddhism, and the essence of Buddhism is to oppose killing. Even the tiniest life must be protected. How can we allow American imperialists to play with atomic weapons that massively destroy humanity? Recently, Tibet established a signature campaign committee against the use of atomic weapons. This means that all the monks and lay people of Tibet have joined the huge torrent of the worldwide signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons together with the people of all nationalities in the country.

In the face of such a powerful world torrent, we have reason to believe that those who plot to use atomic weapons will surely fail.

    坚决反对使用原子武器
    达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措
    现今世界上存在着两个不同的阵营，即以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，及与其完全相反的以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营。这两个不同的阵营，在各种事务上奉行着两种不同的路线。以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，是以自己的辛勤劳动，创造人类无限美好生活为目的；而以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营则是以掠夺他人的劳动成果，以维持少数富翁的巨额利润为目的。
    由于这种原故，在原子能的使用问题上，也存在着两种不同的路线。一种路线是要把人类辛勤劳动的重大发明——原子能，使用于创造人类美好生活的和平目的，并且由世界文明的先驱者苏联，以不久以前所建立的原子能电力站这样无可置辩的事实证明了这种目的；而另一种路线，则是要把人类辛勤劳动的成果，使用于残害广大劳动者本身，以维持少数亿万富翁掠夺他人劳动成果的侵略目的。
    全世界善良的劳动人民，由于自己的亲身经历，时刻向往着和平的幸福生活，坚决反对侵略战争，尤其以极大的愤怒反对使用大规模毁灭人类的原子武器。世界和平理事会常务委员会在一月十九日所发出的在全世界发动大规模的反对使用原子武器的签名运动的号召，完全代表了全世界人民的这种善良愿望。现在在全世界各个角落所已发起的声势浩大的签名运动，就是最好的例证，世界人民完全有决心，使原子战争的策划者归于失败。
    与全世界一切善良的人民一样，中国人民一贯奉行着反对侵略保卫和平的政策，并且他们懂得只有反对侵略才能保卫和平，因而决不允许美帝国主义者前来侵犯他们的和平建设，和霸占他们的领土。中国人民一定要解放台湾，保卫祖国和平建设，这是他们不可动摇的决心。而美帝国主义者所实行的原子讹诈政策更激起了中国人民的无比愤怒。一九五五年二月十二日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员联席会议上所做出的关于发动反对使用原子武器签名运动的决议，就是中国六亿多人民的正义呼声。中国人民将如同他们在历史上所曾做过的一样，将以实际行动证明他们的这种正义呼声决不是空言。
    西藏人民也和全国各兄弟民族人民一样，热爱着自己的幸福生活，同时他深刻地懂得这种幸福生活是团结、友爱的祖国大家庭中所赋予的，是世界和平所带来的，任何对世界和平和对祖国大家庭的侵犯也就是对西藏人民的侵犯。因而西藏人民时刻注视着世界和平的维系，等待着祖国的每一个号召，一定要解放台湾，这同样是西藏人民的决心。西藏人民同时还是笃信佛教的，佛教的真谛是反对杀生，即是一个极细小的生命也须予以保护，又怎能容许美帝国主义者玩弄大规模毁灭人类的原子武器。最近西藏成立了反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会，这就是西藏全体僧俗人民已经和全国各族人民一道，积极加入了全世界反对使用原子武器签名运动的巨大洪流。
    在这样声势浩大的世界洪流面前，我们有理由相信，那些使用原子武器的策划者一定要归于失败。
