    In the villages of Hubei Province that suffered from floods last year, groups of three or five workers can now be seen busily repairing plows, harrows, and other farm tools for the farmers. These are workers from local state-owned farm tool factories and handicraft production cooperatives in Hubei Province. These workers have formed mobile processing groups (teams) to support farmers in spring plowing. In Huanggang Prefecture alone, there are currently more than 800 workers traveling around the countryside. The four mobile teams formed by workers from the Qianjin Ironware Production Cooperative in Huangzhou Town, Huanggang County, repaired more than 600 pieces of old farm tools for farmers and supplied more than 70 pieces of new farm tools to farmers in 23 days. Workers from local state-owned farm tool factories and handicraft production cooperatives in Mianyang, Huangmei, Echeng, Jianli, and Jiayu counties in Hubei Province have also led the vast number of individual handicraft workers and artisans around them to launch a production increase movement to support farmers in spring plowing. Workers from the Shashi local state-owned farm tool factory and handicraft production cooperatives are currently busy rushing to produce a large number of plows, harrows, hoes, baskets, and carrying poles for farmers in dozens of surrounding counties.

    湖北大批工人下乡修理农具
    在湖北省去年遭受水灾的乡村里，现在可以看到三五成群的工人在忙着为农民修理犁、耙等农具。他们就是湖北省各地方国营农具厂和手工业生产合作社的工人。这些工人组成了支援农民春耕生产的流动加工组（队），单是黄冈一个专区，目前就有八百多个工人巡回流动在四乡。由黄冈县黄州镇前进铁器生产合作社的工人组成的四个流动小组，在二十三天内就帮农民修补好了六百多件破旧农具，并供应了农民七十多件新农具。湖北省沔阳、黄梅、鄂城、监利和嘉鱼等县的地方国营农具厂和手工业生产合作社的工人，还带动周围广大的个体手工业工人和手工业者展开了支援农民春耕的增产运动。沙市的地方国营农具厂和手工业生产合作社的工人，目前正忙着给它周围几十个县的农民赶制大批犁、耙、锄头、箩筐和扁担。（新华社）
