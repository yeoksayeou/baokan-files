Farmers in Chenkou County, located in the mountainous northeastern part of Sichuan Province, have converted wasteland into paddy fields. The area is crisscrossed by river valleys, offering much wasteland that could be developed into paddy fields. Along a 120-li stretch of a small river alone, it is estimated that paddy fields capable of producing 10,000 shi of rice annually could be cultivated. Since the winter of 1954, farmers across the county have already dug 4,651 mu of paddy fields. In addition, many weirs and ponds have been built, which can be used to irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land.

When reclaiming the paddy fields, the farmers encountered the most severe cold in over thirty years. The soil was frozen more than a foot deep, with mud and stones frozen together. Members of the Guihua Agricultural Production Cooperative broke more than a dozen corner-head hoes in a single day. But they were not afraid of difficulties. Before dawn, men and women farmers would pick up their hoes and walk to the snowy river valley, working until dark. Youth League members Qiao Anxing and others even secretly worked overtime under the moonlight to reclaim wasteland. They said, "Reclaiming more paddy fields and producing more grain will benefit both the country and ourselves."

Now, farmers throughout the county have begun spring plowing on the newly reclaimed paddy fields. (Our correspondent in Chongqing)

### 城口县农民把荒地开成水田

    城口县农民把荒地开成水田
    四川省东北部山区里的城口县，境内河谷纵横，有许多可以开成水田的荒地。仅在一条一百二十里长的小河两岸，估计就能开出年产一万石大米的水田。从一九五四年冬季以来，全县农民已经挖好了四千六百五十一亩水田。另外，还修好了许多堰塘，可以用来灌溉四千多亩田。
    开水田的时候，农民们碰上了三十多年没有过的严寒。土地冻了一尺多厚，泥沙和石头冻在一块。桂花农业生产合作社的社员们一天就挖坏了十几把羊角锄。但是他们不怕困难。天朦朦亮，男女农民就拿起锄头，走到积雪的河谷里，一直干到天黑。青年团员乔安兴等还趁着月光，悄悄地加班开荒。他们说：“多开些水田，多打些粮食，对国家对自己都有好处。”
    现在，全县农民已在新开出的水田上纷纷开始了春耕。　（本报驻重庆记者）
