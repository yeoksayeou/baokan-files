    Many Important Documents Have Been Translated into Tibetan
    The Translation and Compilation Committee of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has translated many important documents into Tibetan. During the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, the committee translated the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World" into Tibetan and promptly introduced to the Tibetan people the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons launched by the people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland. Now they are rushing to translate the State Council's decision on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.
    In 1954, the committee compiled and translated more than 90 issues of Tibetan news briefs, totaling more than 200,000 words. The Tibetan news briefs have become popular reading material for people of all classes and lamas in monasteries in Tibet. The committee has also translated more than 300 documents on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and related ethnic policies, and translated more than 100 important news items for the Lhasa wired broadcasting station. The committee has also compiled more than ten textbooks on arithmetic and Tibetan language for students in Lhasa elementary schools, compiled "Tibetan Business Conversation" for the Lhasa People's Hospital and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, and translated 150 famous Tibetan folk songs and the famous Tibetan opera "Princess Wencheng" into Chinese.

    许多重要文件已译成藏文
    中国人民解放军西藏军区编译委员会把许多重要文件译成藏文。在反对使用原子武器的签名运动中，委员会把世界和平理事会常务委员会告全世界人民书翻译成藏文，并及时向西藏人民介绍了祖国各兄弟民族人民开展反对使用原子武器签名运动的情况。现在他们又正在赶译国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定。
    在一九五四年内，委员会共编译藏文新闻简讯九十多期、二十多万字，藏文新闻简讯已经成为藏族各阶层人士和寺院喇嘛喜爱的读物。委员会还先后翻译了中华人民共和国宪法和有关民族政策等方面的文件三百多件，为拉萨有线广播电台翻译了一百多条重要新闻。委员会还为拉萨小学的学生编译了算术、藏文等课本十多种，为拉萨市人民医院、邮电局编译了“藏语业务会话”，并把一百五十首著名的藏族民歌和西藏名剧“文成公主”译成汉文。
