Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The National Bureau of Statistics recently held the Fourth National Statistical Work Conference. Based on the analysis of the work situation in 1954 and the characteristics of the increasingly tense and arduous national construction in 1955, which places stricter requirements on statistical work, the central task of national statistical work in 1955 was determined as "Strengthening organizational leadership and vigorously improving the quality of statistical data." At the same time, appropriately increase statistical indicators, expand the scope of reporting, and focus on gradually achieving comprehensiveness in the nation's statistical work.

The conference focused on discussing how to improve the quality of statistical data in the future. It was believed that the following main measures must be taken to improve the quality of statistical data:

First, based on the principles of need and possibility, use methods such as key surveys and sample surveys to overcome the idea of striving for comprehensiveness in the scope of investigation. Second, establish a unified management system for statistical figures. Third, regularly organize a certain amount of manpower to help grass-roots enterprises establish a system of responsibility for statistical work of "unified management, division of labor and cooperation"; gradually improve the original calculation methods and establish a unified accounting system for statistics, accounting, and business. Unify the issuance of statistical reports for counties, districts, and townships, strengthen the leadership of statistical work in counties, districts, and townships, and gradually establish standardized statistical work in rural villages. Fourth, statistical departments above the level of municipalities directly under the province should effectively utilize statistical data to improve statistical analysis and research work. Not only should they regularly submit analysis reports reflecting the implementation of the national economic plan, but they should also, in particular, study the balance of supply, production, and sales, quality issues, and the conservation of manpower, materials, and financial resources, based on the specific circumstances of each department. Fifth, strengthen the political and ideological education of statistical cadres, and establish a pragmatic working attitude and style.

The conference emphasized: This year's statistical work tasks are arduous, and there is a certain gap between the statistical strength and the work tasks. To this end, on the one hand, it is necessary to earnestly review work plans, reduce some less necessary tasks, or complete them with simple and easy methods, and in particular, combat the chaotic phenomena of indiscriminate issuance of statistical reports and hasty deployment of investigation tasks; on the other hand, it is necessary to improve organizational leadership methods, implement agency operation plans, improve work efficiency, and avoid repetitive rework and waste in work. Statistical cadres at all levels should go deeper into the lower levels, "go to enterprises, go to the countryside"; actively propose rationalization proposals for improving work; and should strengthen learning, earnestly study major issues in economic construction, and cultivate themselves into specialized talents in the statistical field.

    第四届全国统计工作会议确定今年中心任务
    加强组织领导大力提高统计资料的质量
    【新华社十六日讯】国家统计局最近召开第四届全国统计工作会议，根据对一九五四年工作情况的分析和一九五五年国家建设更加紧张、艰巨，从而对统计工作的要求更加严格的特点，确定了一九五五年全国统计工作的中心任务是“加强组织领导，大力提高统计资料的质量”。同时适当地增加统计指标，扩大填报范围，有重点、有步骤地使全国的统计工作逐步达到全面化。
    会议着重对今后如何提高统计资料的质量进行了讨论。认为要提高统计资料的质量，必须采取的几个主要措施是：
    第一，根据需要和可能的原则，运用重点调查和抽样调查等方式，克服在调查范围上强求全面的思想。第二，建立统计数字的统一管理制度。第三，经常组织一定力量，帮助基层企业建立统计工作
  “统一管理，分工合作”的责任制度；逐步改进原始计算方法和建立统计、会计、业务的统一核算制度。统一颁发县、区、乡的统计报表，加强对县、区、乡统计工作的领导和逐步建立正规化的乡村统计工作。第四，省辖市以上的统计部门应切实利用统计资料，改进统计分析研究工作。不仅要定期提出反映国民经济计划执行情况的分析报告，特别应针对各部门的具体情况，研究供、产、销的平衡问题，质量问题，以及人力、物力、财力的节约等问题。第五，加强对统计干部的政治思想教育，树立实事求是的工作态度和工作作风。
    会议强调指出：今年统计工作任务艰巨，统计力量和工作任务有着一定距离。为此，一方面必须切实审查工作计划，削减一些不十分必要的任务，或以简单易行的方法来完成它，特别要和滥发统计报表和草率布置调查任务的混乱现象进行斗争；另一方面，必须改进组织领导方法，试行机关作业计划，提高工作效率，避免工作中的重复返工浪费现象。各级统计干部更应深入下层，“到企业去，到农村去”；积极提出改进工作的合理化建议；并应加强学习，认真研究经济建设中的重大问题，将自己培养成为统计事业的专门人材。
