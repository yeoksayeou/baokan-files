Some comrades like to participate in the work of establishing new cooperatives, but are unwilling to work on consolidating newly established and old cooperatives.

Some of these comrades participated in the work of establishing cooperatives in the past. They are satisfied with their existing "capital" and believe that establishing cooperatives is just that same old routine. Moreover, developing a certain number of cooperatives at once provides figures and makes it easy to see results. Consolidating cooperatives, on the other hand, is laborious and doesn't easily show results. Other comrades lack practical work experience. They think that establishing agricultural production cooperatives is beneficial to farmers, and the policies and reasoning are very clear. As long as you "explain" it, the farmers will be "convinced," which is relatively "easy to do." However, helping the already established old cooperatives do a good job in management and ensure increased production involves many problems and is "not easy." Still other comrades believe that establishing cooperatives is advancing the socialist front, which is energizing, while consolidating cooperatives is "staying put," which is not very exciting.

Agricultural cooperation is an overall, systematic task, and it is wrong to divide it into "easy" and "difficult" parts. Facts have proven that only by conscientiously and meticulously doing all the work in the cooperative establishment stage can we lay the foundation for consolidating the cooperatives. And only by doing a good job in consolidating the cooperatives can we more effectively attract farmers and open up a broader path for the future agricultural cooperation movement. Relaxing either the former or the latter will have an adverse impact on the agricultural cooperation movement. In doing any revolutionary work, we should first consider how to adapt to the needs of the revolution and meet the needs of the masses, and not put whether it is "easy to do," easy to "see results," or "in line with one's own interests" in the forefront.

In fact, it is difficult to say which is "easier" and which is "harder," establishing new cooperatives or running new and old cooperatives well.

Consolidating agricultural cooperatives is indeed not easy. However, we must not regard establishing cooperatives as easy. The process of establishing cooperatives is a process of intense struggle between the new and old ideas of the farmers joining the cooperatives. The farmers' ideological activities are diverse. Due to different economic conditions, different levels of socialist consciousness, and different understandings of the various policies of agricultural production cooperatives, the ideological problems among various classes, households, and even family members are also different. Some people understand one problem but have doubts on another; or they are willing today but unwilling tomorrow; or they are willing themselves, but others in the family have different opinions. It is not easy to resolve all kinds of thoughts and achieve "personal willingness and family happiness." Handling the means of production privately owned by the farmers joining the cooperatives is even more complicated work, and it is impossible to apply a "one-size-fits-all" approach everywhere. Doing this work well is also not easy. Cultivating backbone members cannot be effective in just a few days.

However, why do some comrades feel that establishing cooperatives is "very easy"? They subjectively believe: "The general trend is set. Detailed and arduous mass work is no longer timely; that is a 'handicraft method.' Now we can strike while the iron is hot and work vigorously!" When encountering situations that are not as smooth as they thought, they take "shortcuts," using methods such as "lining up," "labeling with big hats," "round-robin talks," or asking farmers to state "reasons for not wanting to join the cooperative" to deal with farmers. When dealing with various specific problems, they use the method of "minority subordinates to the majority," and "passing a resolution" is considered complete; even a few cooperative cadres formulate a set of methods and let the masses follow them. The backbone members of the cooperative are also designated by the cooperative cadres, or they are formalistically "passed" at the members' meeting after being designated. It is said that doing so is indeed "very easy," and a cooperative or even several cooperatives can be "established" in one or two days.

The facts are ruthless. It is precisely in the places where these comrades work that some farmers sell their livestock first when joining the cooperative; some people want to withdraw from the cooperative as soon as it is "established"; in individual areas, the majority of farmers joining the cooperative are ideologically unstable; and some cooperatives are in a state of stagnation in production after being established. Although many new cooperatives have been "established," where are the achievements?

In the process of leading the establishment and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, it is not surprising to encounter some specific difficulties. We must not retreat in the face of difficulties, nor avoid difficulties and seek ease, let alone "turn difficulties into ease" in a unique way and engage in simplicity. Trying to take "shortcuts" here will inevitably bring more difficulties to future work.

On the other hand, we must not regard running old cooperatives well as something so "mysterious." Didn't many people also feel that establishing cooperatives was very "mysterious" in the past? By studying the Party's policies well and going deep into the masses to learn, many people have generally learned how to establish cooperatives. As long as we put down our airs, continue to study policies, and continue to learn from the masses (especially from the well-run old cooperatives), the difficulties in our work can be overcome.

### 建立和巩固哪个“容易”哪个“难”

    建立和巩固哪个“容易”哪个“难”
    李若彬
    有这样一些同志：喜欢参加建立新社的工作，而不愿意作巩固已经建立起来的新社和老社的工作。
    有这种想法的同志，一部分是过去参加过建社工作的，他们满足于已有的“本钱”，认为建社就是那么一套，而且一下子发展多少社，有数字，又容易看出成绩来；巩固社，又费力，又不容易看出成绩。另有一些同志是缺乏实际工作经验的，他们认为建立农业生产合作社既是对农民有利的事情，政策、道理也很清楚，只要一“说”，农民就会“服”，比较“容易办”；而要帮助已经建立起来的老社做好经营管理工作，保证增加生产，里边问题很多，就“不容易”了。还有些同志认为，建社是推进社会主义阵地，干起来有劲；巩固社是“守着不动”，很不带劲。
    农业合作化本是一项整体的、系统的任务，很不该把它分为“容易”和“难”的两部分。事实证明：只有认真、细致地作好建社阶段的各项工作，才能打下巩固社的基础；也只有作好巩固社的工作，才能更有力地吸引农民，给以后的农业合作化运动开辟更为广阔的道路。放松了前者或后者，都会对农业合作化运动发生不利的影响。做任何革命工作，首先应该考虑的是如何适应革命的需要，和满足群众的需要，而不应该把是不是“容易做”是不是容易“看出成绩”是不是“合乎自己的兴趣”放在最前边。
    事实上，建立新社和办好新社老社，也很难说哪个“容易”哪个“难”。
    巩固农业社确实是不容易的。但是，也决不能把建社看成轻而易举。建社过程是入社农民的新旧思想进行激烈斗争的过程，农民的思想活动是多种多样的，各阶层、各户、甚至各个家庭成员之间，由于经济条件不同，社会主义觉悟的程度不同，对农业生产合作社的各项政策的理解不同，因而思想问题也不尽相同。有的人在这个问题上想通了，在另一个问题上又发生疑虑；或者今天愿意了，明天又不愿意；本人愿意了，家里别的人又发生了不同意见。要打通各种思想，达到“本人愿意，全家高兴”，并不是轻而易举的。处理入社农民私有的生产资料，更是复杂的工作，不可能拿“一套”办法到处套用。要做好这项工作，也不是易事。培养骨干，更不是短短几天可以见效的。
    但是，为什么有些同志会觉得建社“很容易”呢？他们主观地认为：“大势已定。细致的、艰苦的群众工作已不适时了，那是‘手工业的方式’。现在可以趁热打铁，大闹大干！”碰到并不像他们想得那么顺利的情况，他们就走“捷路”，用“排队”“扣大帽子”“轮流谈话”，或要农民讲“不愿入社的理由”等办法对待农民。处理各种具体问题，用“少数服从多数”的办法，“通过决议”就算完事；甚至由少数办社干部制定了一套办法，就让群众照办。社里的骨干，也是由办社干部指定的，或者在指定以后在社员大会上形式主义地“通过”一下。据说，这样做，的确“很容易”，在一两天之内就能“建成”一个甚或好多个社。
    事实是无情的。正是在这些同志工作的地方，有些农民在入社时先把牲口卖了；有的社刚刚“建成”，就有人要退社；个别地区入社农民中多数人思想动荡不定；有些社在建社以后生产处于停顿状态。虽然新社“建立”起来不少；可是，成绩究竟在哪里呢？
    在领导建立和巩固农业合作社的过程中，会碰到一些具体困难，这是没有什么奇怪的。我们不能遇难而退，也不能避难就易，更不能独出心裁地“化难为易”，简单从事。想在这里走“捷路”，必然会给以后的工作带来更多的困难。
    另一方面，也不可把办好老社看成多么“神秘”的事。过去很多人不是也觉得建社很“神秘”吗？好好学习党的政策，又深入到群众中去学习，很多人已经大体上学会建社了。只要放下架子，继续学习政策，继续向群众学习（特别是向办好的老社学习），工作中的困难是能够克服的。
