    Wuhan rewards outstanding people's police
    The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee Public Security Bureau held a meeting of model heroes from the 24th to the 26th to reward a group of staff members who had made excellent achievements in serving the people on the public security front.
    From the launch of the merit-making and model-creation campaign in 1953 to 1954, more than 720 model heroes emerged in the Wuhan Public Security Bureau, and 290 of them attended the meeting. There are many moving stories among them.
    During the flood prevention in 1954, many people's policemen in the suburbs of Wuhan, regardless of day or night and regardless of wind or rain, drove small boats to help the suburban farmers solve their difficulties. Luo Yigang, a first-class hero in flood prevention, braved the wind and rain and jumped into the turbulent floodwaters to block the breach, regardless of his life. At that time, many people participated in the flood prevention struggle under his influence. The nearby masses gratefully said: Only the people's police can be so good to us.
    In fire protection work, firefighters used cartoons, blackboards, and various forms of meetings to conduct in-depth fire protection propaganda to residents. In March 1954, a fire broke out in a resident's house on Zhongshan Avenue. Firefighter Mo Guirong braved the thick smoke and fire to run to the burning building and carry an old lady down. At that time, the old lady's son was moved to tears. In the same year, a house of the Zhongnan Hydroelectric Power Engineering Bureau caught fire. Several public security personnel were burned in order to save the hydroelectric power design drawings of the Engineering Bureau. Later, the agency wrote a letter thanking the people's police, saying: "Thanks to your heroism, the main design data of our bureau was not lost, which guaranteed the most valuable property of the country."
    There are also many model deeds in social security work. Special-class model, people's policeman Yuan Zhiming, due to his hard work in studying his profession and mastering the laws of the activities of saboteurs, cracked more than 30 major and minor theft cases in 1953. Model A Wang Caimao was resourceful and calm, and he was very familiar with the activities of thieves. Once, after in-depth investigation, he cracked a case involving Zhang Keming, an extremely cunning big thief nicknamed "Little Beijing" who had traveled to 25 cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hong Kong to steal for 15 years, eliminating a major scourge for the people.

    武汉奖励优秀的人民警察
    武汉市人民委员会公安局在二十四日到二十六日举行功臣模范代表会议，奖励了一批在公安战线上为人民服务有优良成绩的工作人员。
    武汉市公安局从一九五三年开展立功创模工作到一九五四年止，涌现了七百二十多个功臣模范，出席这次会议的功臣模范有二百九十人。他们中间有许多动人的事迹。
    在一九五四年防汛中，武汉郊区许多人民警察不分昼夜、不避风雨地驾着小船，帮助郊区农民解决困难。防汛一等功臣罗毅刚在防汛中，曾冒着狂风暴雨不顾生命危险跳入波涛汹涌的洪水中进行堵口，当时许多人在他的影响下纷纷参加了防汛斗争。附近群众感激地说：只有人民的警察才能对我们这样好。
    在消防工作上，消防人员利用漫画、黑板报及各种会议形式深入对居民进行消防宣传。一九五四年三月中山大道有一家居民失火，消防队员莫桂荣冒着浓烟烈火，跑到失火的楼上将一老太太背下来，当时老太太的儿子感动得流下了眼泪。同年中南水力发电工程局一栋房子起火，消防勇士们为救出工程局水力发电设计图纸，曾有好几个公安人员被火烧伤。后来这个机关写信感谢人民警察说：“由于你们的英勇，使我局主要设计资料没有受到损失，保障了国家最宝贵的财产。”
    在社会治安工作方面也有很多模范事迹。特等模范、人民警察袁志明由于刻苦钻研业务，掌握了破坏分子活动的规律，在一九五三年内共破获大小盗窃案件三十多起。甲等模范王才茂机智沉着，他很熟悉盗窃犯的活动情况。有一次，他经过深入侦察，曾经破获了一个跑遍北京、天津、上海、香港等二十五个城市行窃十五年、绰号“小北京”的极端狡猾的大盗窃犯张克明，为人民除了一大害。
