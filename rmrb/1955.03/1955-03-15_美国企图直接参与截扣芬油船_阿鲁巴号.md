Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The American ruling clique, realizing that using diplomatic pressure on Finland has not prevented the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba" from continuing to China, has now instructed the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to take armed action to intercept the "Aruba," and is preparing to directly involve American armed forces in this piratical act.

Currently, the Chiang bandit gang is constantly clamoring to send its naval and air forces to "intercept" or even "bomb and sink" the "Aruba." The Chiang bandit gang makes no secret of its reliance on the "active assistance" of the United States. On March 12th, the Republican leader of the US Senate, Knowland, publicly stated when answering reporters' questions that if the Chiang bandit gang's interception fails, then the United States should send the Seventh Fleet to carry out the interception.

    美国企图直接参与截扣芬油船“阿鲁巴号”
    【新华社十四日讯】美国统治集团鉴于对芬兰使用外交压力并没有能阻止芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”继续前来中国，现在已指使台湾蒋贼集团准备采取武装行动来截扣“阿鲁巴号”，并且准备以美国武装力量直接参与这一海盗行为。
    目前，蒋贼集团已在不断叫嚣要出动海空军来“拦截”甚至“炸沉”“阿鲁巴号”。蒋贼集团毫不掩饰它依恃的是美国的“积极援助”。三月十二日，美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰在回答记者的问题时公然表示，如果蒋贼集团拦截失败，那么，美国就应该出动第七舰队去进行拦截。
