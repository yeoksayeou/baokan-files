    "Frames" and "Facts"
    Fan Kang
    In the article "Before Summarizing" on the second page of the February 28th People's Daily, some cadres were criticized for writing summaries in their offices without understanding the actual situation. Naturally, such summaries cannot guide work. However, there are also some cadres who cannot be said to be completely ignorant of the actual situation. They often put some individual facts into the "frames" of their summaries to prove that they understand the actual situation, but such summaries also cannot guide the work.
    The manager of a construction engineering company in Wuhan City, when doing a monthly summary, asked the head of the planning section and heard that the construction and installation plan for the previous month had not been completed. He then began to summarize the lessons learned, which were nothing more than "Checking the reasons why we did not complete the plan, first, the plan management is not on track. For example, some construction site section chiefs put the plan in the drawer to sleep. Second, the technical guidance is not timely, resulting in quality accidents." At this moment, the head of the planning section ran over and said that the numbers were miscalculated and the plan was actually overfulfilled! The manager then revised the summary. The kind of regret that was overflowing on the paper a few minutes ago has now been replaced by a joyful tone. Thus, there was the experience of "Studying the reasons why we overfulfilled the plan, first, we strengthened plan management, for example, the ten-day and daily operation plan has been widely implemented," and so on.
    The examples cited by this manager in the two summaries are indeed not fictional. It is a fact that plans are thrown around, and it is also a fact that the ten-day and daily operation plan has been widely implemented. However, these two facts, on the same issue, lead to two diametrically opposed conclusions: one proves that plan management is not on track, and the other overturns this argument, proving that plan management has been strengthened. What is the reason for this?
    It turns out that some of our cadres are doing summaries in this way: they do not draw conclusions based on facts, but first have conclusions and then list facts. Their pockets are filled with all kinds of "facts." These "facts" have not been checked and selected. They can freely take them out to fill the "frames" of the summary. Such summaries, although based on facts, how can they reflect the true situation of the work?
    Lenin said in the article "Party Information is an Important Method of Improving Leadership": "In social phenomena, there is no method more common and unreliable than extracting individual facts and playing with examples. In general, collecting examples is not very difficult, but it is meaningless, or rather it is very bad, because everything exists in the historically specific environment of individual occasions. Some facts, if viewed from their entirety, from their interconnections, are not only 'stubborn' but unconditionally certain. Some facts, if not viewed from their entirety, not from their interconnections, if they are fragmented and arbitrarily fabricated, they are nothing more than toys, or something worse than toys."
    Before summarizing, it is necessary to think carefully about Lenin's words, so as to select the most essential facts from reality, rather than fragmented facts. This can truly see the interconnected whole from these facts, and help us scientifically analyze the current situation and clearly identify the direction.

    “框子”和“事实”
    范康
    二月二十八日，人民日报二版的“总结之前”一文里，批评了有些干部不了解实际情况，关在屋子里写总结。这样自然写不出能够指导工作的总结来。不过，另外也有一些干部，不能说他们完全不了解实际情况，他们常常把一些个别的事实放进自己总结的“框子”，来证明他们是了解实际情况的，但这样的总结同样不能指导工作。
    武汉市一个建筑工程公司的经理，某次做月终总结时，问了问计划科长，听说上月的建筑安装计划没有完成，便总结起教训来，不外是“检查我们没有完成计划的原因，第一是计划管理没有上轨道。譬如有些工地工段负责人把计划放在抽屉里睡大觉。第二是技术指导不及时，发生质量事故。”等等。正在这时，计划科长跑来说数字核算错了，实际上计划是超额完成的！经理便重新改做总结。几分钟前洋溢在纸面上的那种懊恼情绪，现在已被喜气洋洋的腔调代替了。于是有了“研究我们所以超额完成计划的原因，第一是加强了计划管理，例如逐旬分日作业计划已在普遍贯彻”等等经验。
    这位经理在两次总结里所举的例子确实不是虚拟出来的。把计划乱丢乱塞是事实，逐旬分日作业计划已在普遍贯彻也是事实。但是，这两个事实在同一个问题上却引伸出两个针锋相对的结论，一个证明计划管理没有上轨道，另一个推翻了这个论断，证明计划管理已经加强。这是什么道理？
    原来，我们有些干部是这样做总结的：他们不是根据事实来下结论，而是先有结论后列事实。在他们的口袋里装满了各式各样的“事实”。这些“事实”，并非是经过检查和挑选过的。他们可以随便把它们拿来填充到总结的“框子”中去。这样的总结，虽然都有事实作根据，怎能反映工作的真实情况呢？
    列宁在“党内通报是改善领导的重要方法”一文中说道：“在社会现象方面没有比抽取个别事实、玩弄事例是更常用和更不可靠的方法了。一般说来，搜集事例并不多大困难，但这是毫无意义的，或者说这是很坏的，因为一切事情都是存在于个别场合的历史具体环境中。一些事实，如果是从其整体中，从其相互联系中来看，则它们不仅是‘顽强的’，而且无条件是确凿的东西。一些事实，如果不是从其整体中，不是从其相互联系中来看，如果它们是支离破碎和任意造作的东西，则它们无非是一种玩物，或者是比玩物更坏的东西。”
    在总结之前，有必要好好地想想列宁的这段话，以便从实际出发选择最本质的事实，而并非是支离破碎的事实。这才能真正从这些事实中看到互相联系的整体，才能帮助我们科学地分析现状，明辨方向。
