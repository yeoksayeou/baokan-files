Xinhua News Agency, March 11th:

The person in charge of the Office of the Chinese People's Committee for the Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons announced at a press conference on the 11th that from February 14th to March 10th, a total of 25 days, the number of people who participated in the signature campaign nationwide has reached 194,879,988. This shows how much the Chinese people hate and oppose the use of atomic weapons.

The person in charge of the office then talked about the development of the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons across the country. He said: Just as the American aggressive bloc is pursuing a war policy in Asia, Europe, and other regions, frantically clamoring to prepare for an atomic war, the appeal issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council against the use of atomic weapons not only conforms to the interests of world peace, but also to the vital interests of the Chinese people. Therefore, this call has received a wide and enthusiastic response and support from the Chinese people. Since the national signature campaign began on February 14th, the number of people signing in all large and medium-sized cities across the country has reached about 80% of the total population of each city. The campaign is developing on a magnificent scale to the vast rural areas of the country. The signature campaign in Beijing successfully concluded in eight days, collecting more than 2.75 million signatures from February 14th to 21st. More than 5.4 million people signed in Shanghai, and more than 2.4 million people signed in Tianjin. The signatures in various provinces across the country have also achieved good results. For example, more than 22 million people have signed in Shandong Province, more than 21 million people have signed in Sichuan Province, and the number of people participating in the signature in Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces has reached more than half of the total population of each province. In the remote border area of ​​our country—Tibet, 75,189 people also participated in the signature.

The person in charge said: The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons is still continuing to develop across the country. While the signature campaign was being carried out in our country, Chinese scientists widely gave lectures on the peaceful use of atomic energy and against the use of atomic weapons. In just a few days, 160,000 people in Beijing alone listened to their reports. People in various places also made full use of movies, dramas, songs, pictures, blackboard newspapers, propaganda teams, and rooftop broadcasts to carry out propaganda, so that the significance of the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and became known to every household. In addition, a large number of activists participated in the work of propaganda and collecting signatures. In Beijing alone, about 70,000 people participated in these tasks, and in Heilongjiang Province, there were more than 155,000 people. Factories, institutions, troops, schools, streets, and rural areas across the country held signature rallies. Many activists also went deep into families to conduct visits and collect signatures. In order to facilitate the participation of the floating population in the signature, signature stations were also set up on trains and ships, and in stations and hotels, so the signature campaign was very widespread and in-depth.

The person in charge said: People of all ethnic groups and circles with different occupations and religious beliefs who participated in the signature were very excited when signing, expressing great anger at the US imperialists' behavior of occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and their sinister conspiracy to launch an atomic war. They expressed the Chinese people's firm will to resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons but never be afraid of atomic weapons, and expressed their determination to liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan and never stop until the goal is achieved. While signing against the use of atomic weapons, the Chinese people expressed their warm support for the Soviet Union's just proposition of unconditionally banning atomic weapons and applying atomic energy to peaceful undertakings, and expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union for its assistance to our country in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The person in charge introduced many vivid examples produced in the signature campaign. Lan, a 136-year-old Yao ethnic old lady, and her four generations of descendants, and Qi Baishi, a 95-year-old painter, all signed their names. Zhu Bojin, a worker at a steel plant in Xinjiang and a model worker of Grade A, said when signing: "We must use the practical action of making good steel to fight back against the war cries of American imperialism!" An old lady named Song in the countryside of Tianjin said when signing: "Kill tens of thousands of people? How can that be allowed? I will oppose even killing one innocent person."

The person in charge finally said: The firm will and solid unity of the Chinese people expressed in the signature campaign are the source of our strength to resolutely oppose American aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons. The combined forces of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world will surely be able to shatter all the war plans of the warmongers. The atomic maniacs originally wanted to use atomic weapons to scare the Chinese people and the people of the world, but the Chinese people will never be scared, and the people of the world will never be scared. It is only the atomic maniacs themselves who will be scared!

    反对使用原子武器签名运动迅速发展
    全国签名人数已近二亿
    【新华社十一日讯】中国人民反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会办公室负责人十一日在记者招待会上宣布：从二月十四日到三月十日止的二十五天中，全国人民参加签名的已经有一亿九千四百八十七万九千九百八十八人之多，这说明了中国人民是如何憎恨与反对使用原子武器。
    办公室负责人接着谈到反对使用原子武器签名运动在全国开展的情况，他说：正当美国侵略集团在亚洲、欧洲和其他地区推行战争政策、疯狂叫嚣准备发动原子战争的时候，世界和平理事会常务委员会发出的反对使用原子武器的号召，不仅符合世界和平的利益，也符合于中国人民切身的利益。因此，这一号召得到中国人民广泛热烈的响应与拥护。从二月十四日全国签名运动展开以来，现在全国所有大中城市签名的人数都达到各该城市总人口的百分之八十左右，运动正以波澜壮阔的规模向全国广大农村发展中。北京市的签名运动在八天内即胜利结束，从二月十四日到二十一日共征集了二百七十五万多人的签名。上海市有五百四十多万人签名，天津市有二百四十多万人签名。全国各省的签名也有很好的成绩。例如山东省已有二千二百多万人签名，四川省已有二千一百多万人签名，黑龙江、陕西、山西等省参加签名的人数都已达到各该省总人口的半数以上。在我国遥远的边疆——西藏，也有七万五千一百八十九人参加签名。
    负责人说：反对使用原子武器签名运动还正在全国继续发展。在我国签名运动开展的同时，我国科学家广泛地作了关于原子能和平利用和反对使用原子武器的讲演。在短短的几天中，仅在北京市就有十六万人听了他们的报告。各地人民还充分利用了电影，戏剧，歌唱，图画，黑板报，宣传队和屋顶广播等方式进行宣传，使反对使用原子武器签名运动的意义深入人心，家喻户晓。此外还有大批积极分子参加宣传和征集签名的工作。参加这些工作的，仅在北京市即达七万人左右，在黑龙江省有十五万五千多人。各地工厂、机关、部队、学校、街道和农村都举行了签名集会，不少积极分子还深入家庭去进行访问和征集签名。为了便利流动人口参加签名，在火车和轮船上，在车站和旅店内也都设有签名站，所以签名运动非常普遍、深入。
    负责人说：参加签名的不同职业、不同宗教信仰的各族各界人民，在签名时情绪都很激昂，对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的行为和企图发动原子战争的罪恶阴谋表示极大的愤怒。他们表达了中国人民坚决反对使用原子武器但是绝不害怕原子武器的坚强意志，表达了一定要解放祖国的领土台湾不达目的决不休止的决心。在签名反对使用原子武器的同时，中国人民表示热烈支持苏联无条件禁止原子武器并把原子能应用于和平事业的正义主张，并衷心感谢苏联在和平利用原子能方面对我国的帮助。
    负责人介绍了在签名运动中产生的许多生动的事例。一百三十六岁的瑶族蓝老太太和她的四代子孙，九十五岁的老画家齐白石都签了名。新疆某钢铁厂工人、甲等劳动模范朱伯金在签名时说：“我们要用炼好钢的实际行动来回击美帝国主义的战争叫嚣！”天津郊区乡间一位宋老太太在签名时说：
  “杀死成千上万的人吗？那怎能答应，就是杀死一个无辜的人我也要反对。”
    负责人最后说：在签名运动中所表达出来的中国人民的坚定的意志与巩固的团结，就是我们坚决反对美国侵略、坚决要解放台湾、坚决反对使用原子武器的力量的泉源。中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民联合起来的力量一定能够粉碎一切战争贩子的战争计划。原子狂人们原想利用原子武器吓倒中国人民，吓倒全世界人民，然而中国人民是永远吓不倒的，全世界人民也是永远吓不倒的，被吓倒的将只是原子狂人们自己！
