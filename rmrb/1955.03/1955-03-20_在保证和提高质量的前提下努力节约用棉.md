    Strive to Save Cotton While Ensuring and Improving Quality
    Ge Xian
    Generally speaking, cotton textile enterprises across the country attach importance to saving cotton and have achieved certain results. In 1954, the average cotton consumption per yarn piece in national state-owned and central state-private joint ventures was reduced by 1.42 jin compared to 1953, saving 2,395 tons of cotton throughout the year. Spinning and weaving these cottons into cloth could provide more than 3.2 million people with a set of clothing each. However, at the same time, there was a general tendency to neglect product quality. Although this tendency has begun to be corrected (the first-class rate of cotton cloth in February has slightly increased), it is still developing in some units.
    According to the historical situation of textile enterprises, the quality of yarn and cloth generally improves compared to the third quarter after the new cotton enters the market in the fourth quarter of each year due to the improvement in the quality of raw cotton. However, the situation in the fourth quarter of 1954 was the opposite. The strength of cotton yarn generally decreased by 3 to 8 pounds, impurities increased by 15% to 20%, and the amount of superior and first-class yarn decreased. Cotton cloth also had a large increase in small defects on the cloth surface due to uneven yarn thickness, coarse yarn, and more impurities, resulting in a decline in the first-class rate. In January of this year, the first-class rate of cotton cloth in various factories was still 0.3% lower than in December of last year. The poor quality of cotton cloth grey fabrics also caused the quality of printed and dyed fabrics to decline. In January, nine of the fourteen printing and dyeing enterprises (excluding the Southwest region) failed to complete their quality plans. In January, the standard product rate of cotton yarn in the Hebei region was only 43.14%.
    The decline in the quality of yarn and cloth is mainly the result of many enterprises unilaterally pursuing cotton savings. Instead of mobilizing the masses of employees, improving the technology of the cleaning and carding, steel wire and other departments, and rationally handling cotton waste, they simply considered expanding the scope of raw cotton recycling, re-using parts of the broken seeds and waste (two kinds of waste cotton) that should not have been re-used. They even regarded re-using broken seeds and waste as the main means of saving cotton, believing that "cotton consumption cannot be reduced if broken seeds and waste are not re-used," which seriously caused uneven cotton laps and poor yarn quality. In order to simply pursue the decline in cotton consumption figures, some enterprises took some improper technical measures, such as pasting paper on the bottom of the carding machine to reduce the cotton waste under the machine, and covering the cleaning dust cage with gauze to reduce the floor cotton waste, regardless of the amount of impurities contained in the raw cotton, and only pursuing the "reduction" of the cotton waste rate, so that many dust and short fibers could not fall and were spun into yarn.
    Even more serious is that individual enterprises have even adopted a method of reducing the weight of cotton yarn. The No. 1 State-owned Northwest Cotton Textile Factory did just this. The spinning workshop of this factory once won the honorary title of national model workshop, but the leaders of this factory did not actively improve their work, but wanted to be "model" in saving raw cotton, so they adopted the means of cutting corners. As a result, cotton consumption was reduced, but the weight and firmness of the yarn were also reduced.
    Saving cotton and improving quality are inseparable and unified requirements of the textile industry. Some cotton textile factories save cotton on the premise of ensuring and improving quality, achieving the goal of both ensuring quality and saving raw cotton. The No. 3 State-owned Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory, on the one hand, makes full use of effective fibers and rationally increases the production rate, and on the other hand, improves the impurity removal efficiency and recycles effective fibers. By improving production management and technical leadership, rectifying the receipt and payment management system for raw cotton, semi-finished products, recycled cotton, and waste, they also organized a raw cotton quota management team and a yarn saving team to specifically study the issues of saving cotton, saving yarn, and improving quality. In 1953, the average cotton consumption of 23-count yarn in this factory was as high as 405 jin. After improvement, it was reduced to 385 jin in the fourth quarter of 1954. In January and February of this year, the average cotton consumption per yarn piece was further reduced. While the amount of cotton used is gradually reduced, the quality of yarn and cloth is gradually improved. The No. 16 State-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory has always been a factory with good cotton saving in Shanghai textile enterprises. In December of last year, they created a new record for the lowest cotton consumption in Shanghai cotton textile factories, and the quality of various products met the requirements of the national plan. Zhu Xingfu, an old worker in the cleaning and carding workshop of this factory, made many technical improvements to the cleaning and carding machine, which played a great role in saving raw cotton. From January to April last year, the cotton saving work of the Nantong State-Private Joint Venture Dasheng No. 1 Textile Factory was carried out on the basis of improving quality. The average cotton consumption per yarn piece in April was reduced by five jin compared to the first quarter, creating a new record for cotton saving in Jiangsu Province, and the quality was improved instead, which was praised by the superiors. However, since May, the leadership of this factory has been satisfied with past achievements and seriously neglected quality, no longer strengthened technical measures, and did not further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of employees. Therefore, from May to August, although the amount of cotton used decreased somewhat, the quality of 20-count yarn and 21-count weft yarn both dropped from grade B to grade C, and the quality of other counts of yarn also decreased month by month. In September of last year, the working group jointly organized by the Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China inspected this factory and corrected the tendency to neglect quality. After that, 20-count yarn and 21-count yarn were raised from grade C to grade B. These all show that saving cotton can be achieved while ensuring and improving quality.
    The supply of cotton cloth is closely related to the lives of the broad masses of the people, and it is also related to the connection between the Party and the state and the masses of the people. Satisfying the growing needs of urban and rural people as much as possible and as well as possible is the basic task of the textile industry. Saving a little more cotton can spin a little more yarn, and saving a little more waste silk can weave a little more cloth. This year, because the supply of raw cotton cannot keep up with the needs of the textile industry, saving raw cotton is an urgent political task for the textile industry. At present, although the phenomenon of neglecting product quality has changed somewhat, because the quality standards of yarn and cloth have been improved this year, and the quality of some raw cotton is not good enough, the task of textile industry workers is very arduous. We must overcome the erroneous idea that "it is inevitable to drop rice grains when eating, and there can be no waste in production," and oppose the view that saving cotton and ensuring quality are contradictory. We must rationally increase the production rate and make full use of spinnable fibers under the condition of ensuring quality, and strive to spin more and better yarn and weave more and better cloth for the country and the people.

    在保证和提高质量的前提下努力节约用棉
    葛娴
    全国各棉纺织企业对节约用棉，一般说来是重视的，也取得了一定成绩。一九五四年全国国营和中央公私合营企业，平均每件纱的用棉量，比一九五三年降低了一点四二市斤，全年节约用棉二千三百九十五吨，用这些棉花纺纱织成布，可以供三百二十多万人每人做一套衣服。但是，同时又普遍产生忽视产品质量的偏向，目前，这种偏向虽已开始纠正（二月份的棉布正品率稍有提高），但在某些单位还有发展。
    根据纺织企业历年的情况，每年第四季度新棉上市后，由于原棉的质量提高了，纱布的质量也比第三季度有相应的提高。可是，一九五四年第四季度的情况却相反，棉纱强力一般下降了三磅到八磅，杂质增加了百分之十五到二十，上等纱和一等纱减少了。棉布也因棉纱的条干不匀、粗节纱多、杂质多而使布面上的小疵点大大增多，正品率下降。今年一月份各厂棉布的正品率还比去年十二月份降低了百分之零点三。棉布的坯布质量差，印染布的质量也跟着下降，一月份在十四个印染企业中
  （不包括西南地区），就有九个企业完不成质量计划。一月份河北地区棉纱的标准品率仅达百分之四三点一四。
    纱布质量的下降，主要是许多企业片面追求节约用棉的结果。他们没有从发动职工群众，改进清花、钢丝等部门的技术和合理处理落棉着手，而是单纯地从扩大原棉的回用范围来考虑问题，把破籽、下脚（两种废花）中不该回用的部分也回用了，甚至把回用破籽、下脚作为节约用棉的主要手段，认为“破籽下脚不回用，用棉量就没法降低”，因而严重地造成了棉卷不匀和成纱质量的低劣现象。有些企业为了单纯追求用棉数字的下降，采取了一些不正当的技术措施，如为了减少梳棉车肚花，将漏底用纸糊起来，为了减少地弄花，将清花尘笼用纱窗包起来，不管原棉含杂多少，只一味追求落棉率的
  “减少”，因此，使许多尘杂和短绒无法落下，都纺成了纱。
    更严重的是，个别企业竟采取了一种减轻棉纱重量的办法。国营西北第一棉纺织厂就是这样做的。这个厂的纺纱工场曾经获得全国模范工场的光荣称号，可是这个厂的领导人员，不积极改进工作，但又想在节约原棉方面也“模范”，就采用了偷工减料的手段，结果用棉量是降低了，但纱的重量和坚牢度也降低了。
    节约用棉和提高质量是纺织业不可分割的统一要求。有些棉纺织厂就是在保证和提高质量的前提下来节约用棉，达到了既保证质量，又节约原棉的目的。国营青岛第三棉纺织厂一方面充分利用有效纤维，合理地提高制成率，另一方面提高除杂效率，回用有效纤维。他们通过改善生产管理工作和技术领导工作，整顿原棉、半制品、回花、下脚等收付管理制度，同时组织了一个原棉定额管理小组和一个节约用纱小组，专门研究节约用棉、用纱和提高质量问题。这个厂在一九五三年，二十三支纱平均用棉量高达四百零五市斤，经过改进，到一九五四年第四季度，就降低到三百八十五市斤，今年一、二月份，平均每件纱的用棉量又有降低。在用棉量逐步降低的同时，纱布质量逐步提高。国营上海第十六棉纺织厂是上海纺织企业中节约用棉一向较好的一个工厂。去年十二月份，他们创造了上海各棉纺织厂用棉量最低的新纪录，而各种产品质量，都符合国家计划的要求。这个厂清梳车间老工人朱杏福，在清梳机上做了许多件技术改进，对节约原棉起很大作用。南通市公私合营大生第一纺织厂去年一月到四月，节约用棉工作是在提高质量的基础上进行的，四月份平均每件纱用棉量比第一季度降低了五斤，创造了江苏省节约用棉的新纪录，而质量反而有了提高，受到了上级的表扬。可是，从五月份起，由于这个厂的领导上满足于过去的成绩，严重地忽视了质量，不再加强技术措施，没有进一步发挥职工群众的积极性。因此，五月到八月，用棉量虽下降了一些，但是，二十支纱和二十一支纬纱的质量都从乙级降到丙级，其他各支纱的质量也都逐月下降。去年九月，纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会等机关联合组织的工作组到这个厂检查并纠正忽视质量等偏向后，二十支纱和二十一支纱又从丙级提高到乙级。这些都说明了节约用棉跟保证和提高质量是完全可以做到的。
    棉布的供应和广大人民的生活息息相关，也就关系着党和国家同人民群众的联系。尽可能又多、又好地满足城乡人民日益增长的需要，是纺织工业的基本任务。多节约一点棉花，就能多纺一点纱，多节约一些回丝，就能多织一些布。今年，由于原棉的供应赶不上纺织业的需要，节约原棉更是纺织工业当前迫切的政治任务。目前，忽视产品质量的现象虽有所改变，但因为今年纱、布的质量标准提高了，而部分原棉质量又不够好，所以，纺织工业的职工的任务是非常艰巨的。必须克服那种“吃饭免不了掉米粒、生产那能没有浪费”的错误思想，反对把节约用棉和保证质量对立起来的看法。必须在保证质量的条件下，合理地提高制成率，充分利用可纺纤维，努力为国家和人民纺出更多更好的纱，织出更多更好的布来。
