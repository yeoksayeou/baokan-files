Li Guangchang Has Not Had a Driving Accident in Nine Years

    Li Guangchang, the locomotive driver chief of the Sanke Shu locomotive section of the Harbin Railway Bureau, has not had any locomotive damage or driving accidents in the past nine years and has won the title of Advanced Worker of the Harbin Railway Administration.
    For the past nine years, Li Guangchang has been using various types of locomotives, and he has been able to meticulously maintain each locomotive he has used. Before each trip, he always gets enough rest, concentrates on his work, and acts in unison with each station's shunting staff. Li Guangchang also humbly studies and implements the Lu Ning locomotive maintenance method, which not only prevents locomotive damage but also saves a lot of locomotive washing and inspection costs. He also promoted the importance of maintenance among other drivers through his own actions of paying attention to locomotive maintenance. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    哈尔滨铁路分局三棵树机务段机车司机长李广昌，九年来未发生过机车破损和行车事故，已荣获哈尔滨铁路管理局先进工作者的称号。
    李广昌九年来一直是使用杂型机车，他对使用过的每台机车都能做到精心细致的保养。在出乘前，他总是充分的休息，在工作中集中精神，并和每个车站调车员行动一致。李广昌还虚心地学习和执行鲁宁机车保养法，不仅防止了机车破损，还节省大量机车洗检费用。他并以自己注意保养机车的行动，推动了其他司机重视保养工作。（据新华社讯）
