Shanxi, Hebei, and Fujian Thoroughly Convey the "Three Fixes" Policy for Grain
Cadres and Farmers Actively Tap Potential to Strive for Increased Production

[Report from this newspaper] Since mid-March, counties in Shanxi Province have successively convened expanded cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels to deploy spring plowing production and implement the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain.

Through reports at the general meetings and discussions in groups, the cadres attending the meetings unanimously expressed their warm support for the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" method for grain. At the expanded cadre meetings, counties not only formulated plans for increased production, sales, and supply of grain for the year on a township basis, but also, through the implementation of the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain, greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels to lead farmers in tapping potential for exceeding production targets. After revising their plans, the forty-six townships in Jieyu County can plant a total of more than 252,580 mu of cotton this year, an increase of more than 33,400 mu compared to 1954; the planned unit area yield of cotton is also increased from 63 jin (lint) last year to 65 jin.

After studying the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain, the cadres attending the meeting further understood the national grain purchase and sales policy and greatly improved their ideological awareness. Cadres in many areas verified the grain supply plan based on the actual needs of their locality. For example, before the expanded cadre meeting was held in Xin County, the total amount of grain requested for supply by all townships in the county was 5 million jin. After practical calculation and research by cadres in each township at the expanded cadre meeting, the planned supply of grain was reduced to 2.3 million jin.

Currently, all townships in the province are convening meetings of township people's representatives to discuss and adopt the township's "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" plan for grain, to further promote spring plowing production.

Xinhua News Agency reported: Man City, Zunhua and other ten counties and other counties nearly a hundred key townships, has the grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" measures transmitted to the township. This measure greatly encouraged the patriotic enthusiasm of farmers to increase production.

After understanding the production, purchase, and sales targets for grain in their townships for 1955, farmers in each township in Mancheng County successively planned their annual production based on these targets, saying that they had a "number" in mind. The sixty-four townships in the county challenged each other and launched a patriotic production increase competition. Farmers in Yong'anzhuang Township in the county expressed their intention to work hard to complete the fixed production target, and planned to use small empty spaces along roadsides and field edges to plant 20,000 hemp plants. After setting their production increase plans, the nine agricultural production cooperatives in the township immediately added two heads of livestock and thirteen pigs, and took the lead in launching a patriotic production increase competition, quickly accumulating more than 80,000 loads of fertilizer. At the same time, they also harrowed more than 2,900 mu of land two or three times, and plowed 250 mu of land that had not been autumn-tilled last year. Now, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various counties are looking for fertilizer sources and accumulating more fertilizer to create conditions for this year's production increase.

Xinhua News Agency reported: After the announcement of the policy of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, the enthusiasm of farmers in Fujian Province for production has increased even more.

The agricultural season in Fujian is relatively early, and many mutual aid and cooperation organizations had already set their production increase plans for this year in January and February, but recently, after they discussed the "Three Fixes" policy for grain, they successively found many new methods for increasing production and revised their original production increase plans. Members of the Zhongli Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangkou Town, Jianyang County, said: The state's grain policy is really thoughtful. The state takes care of us farmers, and we must produce more grain to support the state. Therefore, in addition to guaranteeing to increase production by 40,000 jin of grain as originally planned, and selling 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, they decided to further utilize mountain land and wasteland to plant high-yield crops, increasing production by 30,000 jin of sweet potatoes, 1,000 jin of taro, and 70,000 jin of pumpkins. Farmers in Houtian Township, Longyan County, launched a red flag competition for ten days of intensive fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, and seedling cultivation in order to strive for more production, more sales of surplus grain, and more grain retention for themselves.

    山西河北福建深入传达粮食“三定”政策
    干部和农民积极挖潜力争取增产
   【本报讯】三月中旬以来，山西省各县先后召开县、区、乡三级扩大干部会议，布置春耕生产和贯彻粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策的工作。
    各地经过大会报告和小组讨论，到会干部对粮食“定产、定购、定销”办法一致表示热烈拥护。各县在三级扩大干部会议上不仅以乡为单位制订出本年的增产计划和售粮计划、供应计划，而且通过贯彻粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策还大大激发了各级干部领导农民挖掘潜力超额增产的积极性。解虞县四十六个乡经过修订计划，今年全县的棉花共可种到二十五万二千五百八十多亩，比一九五四年扩大三万三千四百多亩；棉花的单位面积产量也计划由去年的六十三斤（皮棉）提高为六十五斤。
    经过学习粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策，到会干部进一步对国家粮食购销政策摸了底，思想觉悟大大提高。许多地区的干部根据当地实际需要，核实了粮食供应计划。如忻县在举行扩大干部会议以前，全县各乡要求供应粮食的总量是五百万斤，经过在扩大干部会议上各乡干部切实计算研究，粮食计划供应数量已降为二百三十万斤。
    现在，全省各乡正在召开乡人民代表大会会议，以讨论通过全乡粮食“定产、定购、定销”计划，进一步推动春耕生产工作。
    据新华社讯：河北省满城、遵化等十个县和其他各县的近百个重点乡，已把粮食“定产、定购、定销”措施传达到乡。这一措施大大地鼓舞了农民的爱国增产热情。
    满城县各乡农民了解本乡一九五五年粮食的产、购、销指标后，纷纷按这些指标打算了全年的生产，都说心里有了“数”。全县六十四个乡互相挑战，展开了爱国增产竞赛运动。这个县永安庄乡的农民表示要努力完成定产的指标，并计划利用路边、地头小块空地种两万棵大麻子。全乡九个农业生产合作社在订了增产计划后，立即添买了两头牲口和十三口猪，并带头展开爱国增产竞赛，很快积出了八万多驮肥料。同时还把两千九百多亩地普耙了两、三遍，二百五十亩去年没秋耕的地也翻耕了。现在，各县农业生产合作社和互助组都在找肥源多积肥，给今年的增产创造条件。
    据新华社讯：粮食定产、定购、定销政策公布后，福建省农民生产热情更加高涨。
    福建农事季节较早，许多互助合作组织在一、二月间就订好了今年增产计划，但最近当他们讨论了粮食“三定”政策后，纷纷找出许多新的增产办法，修订了原来的增产计划。建阳县将口镇众力农业社社员们说：国家的粮食政策真周到，国家照顾我们农民，我们要生产更多的粮食支援国家。因此他们除保证按原计划增产四万斤粮食，和卖给国家余粮十万斤外，决定再利用山地、荒地种植高产作物，增产三万斤甘薯、一千斤芋头和七万斤南瓜。龙岩县后田乡农民为了争取多增产、多卖余粮、自己多留粮，开展了十天突击积肥、修水利、育秧的红旗竞赛。
