Mobile Trade Groups Active in Yumen Oilfield

    The mobile trade groups active in the construction sites, employee dormitories, and entertainment venues of the Yumen Oilfield in Gansu Province are enthusiastically serving the employees and their families. Construction sites such as Baiyanghe and Qingcaowan are about 20 kilometers away from the mining area, and it used to be very inconvenient for employees to buy things. The state-owned trading company in the Yumen Oilfield sent mobile trade groups here, which made the employees very happy. They vacated rooms for the mobile trade groups to operate, used cars to help the mobile trade groups transport goods, and some even brought boiling water to the trade groups and helped light the stove. The salespersons of the mobile trade groups actively supplied various goods according to the needs of the employees. Until 1:00 a.m., workers on the night shift could still buy pastries.
    Employee dormitories and cultural entertainment venues are also places that mobile trade groups frequently visit. Salespersons from the vegetable departments of the Zhongping District and Nanping District Trading Companies load melons, fruits, and frozen chickens onto carts and sell them at the skating rink and theater entrances. The Donggang Trading Company's retail department also delivers sweets to entertainment venues such as cinemas.

Supply Points on Basic Construction Sites

    The Wuhan Municipal Company of the China General Merchandise Company has set up eleven fixed supply points and two mobile supply groups on basic construction sites. They started with only over a hundred kinds of goods, but now they have over two hundred kinds. Items like toothbrushes, soap, towels, enamel basins, rubber shoes, work gloves, and diaries can all be bought nearby at the construction site supply stations.
    The salespersons' service slogan is: "Wherever the workers go, we will supply them there." The Xiannüshan quarry construction site in Hanyang is more than 30 miles away from the city. Employees from the Hanyang retail department of the General Merchandise Company carry goods every day to supply the workers. The General Merchandise Company has also set up a supply point at another construction site more than 30 miles away from the city. The workers can buy their favorite rubber shoes, sneakers, and other items nearby.

Supporting Farmers in Disaster Areas to Plant Early-Maturing Crops

    In order to support the disaster-stricken farmers in Hebei Province in 1954 to overcome the spring famine, the supply and marketing cooperatives actively supplied a large number of early-maturing crop seeds to the farmers. As of March 10, according to incomplete statistics from only five special districts, including Tianjin, Baoding, Tongxian, Cangxian, and Shijiazhuang, more than 9.3 million jin of early-maturing crop seeds such as spring wheat, barley, and peas have been supplied to the farmers. In Qingyuan County, which was severely affected by the disaster, the supply and marketing cooperatives also purchased more than 3,000 jin of early-maturing vegetable seeds such as cowpeas, North China pumpkins, and fennel from other places, according to the local farmers' planting habits.
    In order to help farmers eliminate pests and ensure full seedling emergence, many supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas paid attention to supplying pesticides for seed dressing while supplying seeds. The Anxin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative promptly transported more than 2,500 jin of Ceresan to the grassroots supply units for farmers to use for seed dressing, which was welcomed by the farmers. The Baodi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also set up nine medicine seed dressing stations to help farmers dress seeds. (Wang Yingmin)

Inviting Farmers to Evaluate Means of Production

    The Yangquanzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Third District of Yixian County, Liaoning Province, recently held an exhibition for the appraisal of means of production. The exhibition was attended by the directors of 37 agricultural production cooperatives in the vicinity, representatives of various weaving, ironworking, and leather handicraft production cooperatives in the county, and cadres of the county supply and marketing cooperative. The exhibition displayed more than 300 kinds of handicraft products such as flower carts, chaff cutters, iron shovels, iron picks, plows, leather, and ropes. Cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative gave detailed explanations of the specifications, prices, and other aspects of various products to the audience. After the visit, a discussion was held. During the discussion, the directors of the agricultural production cooperatives put forward 39 suggestions for improvement on products such as shovel machines and carrying baskets. In addition, they also criticized the shortcomings of the supply and marketing cooperative in organizing procurement and storing materials. At the meeting, 31 agricultural production cooperatives signed contracts and agreements with the supply and marketing cooperative regarding the supply of means of production. Finally, the supply and marketing cooperative revised the original spring plowing material supply plan according to the actual needs of the agricultural production cooperatives and the farmers, and signed order contracts with the handicraft production cooperatives.

Strengthening Grain Supply Work

    The Dongting Lake levee renovation project is nearing completion. In order to support the farmers in the lake area to smoothly resume production, the Changde Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hunan Province has allocated a batch of grain to these disaster-stricken areas in addition to the original grain supply quota, based on the consumption situation of the production season. Grain departments in various places are actively improving the supply work to deliver grain to the farmers in a timely manner. In order to prevent farmers from delaying production time, many grain supply points have implemented a "continuous work system." From 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. every day, the masses can buy grain at any time. Six districts in Yiyang County have added mobile grain supply points, and increased staff at several supply points with larger supply volumes. Hanshou County uses transportation conditions such as lakes and ports to transport grain to supply villages and areas in a planned way by boat. (Wang Yingjin)

Salespersons Delivering Goods to the Countryside

    In order to support spring plowing production, the Tawan Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Third District of Suixian County, Hubei Province, in addition to organizing small vendors to carry oil to the countryside and doing a good job in market supply, has recently adopted the method of "delivering goods on non-market days" to deliver means of production and means of livelihood to the farmers. At present, 14 salespersons are participating in the work of delivering goods to the countryside, divided into seven groups. According to statistics from February 19 to 25, these seven groups went to the countryside 28 times, each time supplying more than 1 million yuan (old currency, same below) of goods, and purchasing local products worth a total of 1.09 billion yuan. These delivery groups are very popular among the farmers. The goods they deliver to the countryside originally included several types such as cloth and groceries, but now they have increased to include small general merchandise, salt, and plowshares according to the needs of the masses.

Actively Organizing Local Miscellaneous Fertilizers

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas of Sichuan Province are actively organizing local miscellaneous fertilizers. In coordination with spring plowing, the province will supply farmers with more than 1 million dan of various miscellaneous fertilizers.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places vigorously stored miscellaneous fertilizers in the winter of 1954. The First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengjie County had stored and supplied more than 1 million jin of various miscellaneous fertilizers by the end of February. In addition to preparing a large amount of hair, manure, and plant ash, the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengdu County also plans to collect about 90,000 jin of pickled mustard tuber peel for farmers to compost. The fertilizer station of the Luzhou Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative can organize and supply 17.35 million jin of human manure alone in the first quarter of this year. At present, various places are vigorously supplying miscellaneous fertilizers to farmers. (Tian Qiyu)

Large Quantities of Summer Fabrics Arrive in Xinjiang

    In order to timely supply the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province with the woolen fabrics needed for spring and summer, the Xinjiang Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company signed supply contracts with production units in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places in the fourth quarter of 1954, and advanced the import of hundreds of kinds of commodities from the mainland from December. The volume of best-selling commodities imported this year has generally increased by more than double compared with the same period in 1954. For example, the import volume of corduroy has increased by five times compared with the same period in 1954, and dacron gauze has increased by three times compared with the same period in 1954. New varieties have also been added this year, including mesh fabric, labor cloth, and skirt fabrics favored by ethnic minority women. These goods generally arrived in Urumqi City around the end of January. The Xinjiang Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company has promptly allocated these goods to grassroots supply units according to the allocation supply contracts signed with various places.

Beautiful Spring Clothing Meets Consumers

    A large number of beautiful spring clothes have recently been displayed in the cloth and woolen fabric store of the Shenyang Municipal Company of the China General Merchandise Company. Labor cloth dual-purpose youth suits, woolen vests, Peace woolen suits, various colored corduroy children's clothing, and smocks have attracted the eyes of countless consumers.
    A young couple walked into the store and wanted to buy fabric to make a pair of women's slacks. The salesperson of the store took out gabardine women's slacks and introduced them to them: "The spring clothes we make this year are not only made of good materials and beautiful styles, but also made of sturdy workmanship. Even the insertion points of the trouser pockets are carefully locked with needles. It is faster, better, and saves money than buying fabric and making it yourself." These two customers were moved by the salesperson's words and decided to buy a pair of gabardine women's slacks. An employee of a factory in Tiexi District bought a labor cloth dual-purpose top here. A neighbor of his praised it very much, thinking that it was great to wear labor cloth when going to work and blue cloth when getting off work, so he also went to buy one. (Yang Qingzhang)

    更好地为生产和消费者服务
    活跃在玉门油矿的流动贸易组
      活跃在甘肃省玉门油矿区工地、职工宿舍和娱乐场所的流动贸易组，热心地为职工和家属们服务。白杨河、青草湾等工地都离矿区二十公里左右，过去职工们买东西很不方便。玉门油矿区的国营贸易公司派流动贸易组到这里来，职工们非常高兴，他们为流动贸易组腾出营业的房间，用汽车帮助流动贸易组运货，有的还给贸易组送开水，帮着生火炉。流动贸易组的营业员们积极根据职工们的需要，供应各种货物。直到夜间一点钟，上夜班的工人还能买到糕点。
    职工宿舍和文化娱乐场所，也是流动贸易组经常去的地方。中坪区、南坪区贸易公司菜蔬部的营业员把瓜果、冻鸡等装到小车上，拉到滑冰场和戏院门口去卖。东岗贸易公司门市部也把糖果送到电影院等娱乐场所去供应。
    基本建设工地上的供应点
    中国百货公司武汉市公司在基本建设工地设立了十一个固定供应点、两个流动供应组。它们供应的商品开始时只有一百多种，现在已经有二百多种了。像牙刷、肥皂、毛巾、搪瓷脸盆、胶鞋、工作手套、日记本等，在工地供应站都可以就近买到。
    营业员们的服务口号是：“工人到那里，我们就供应到那里”。汉阳仙女山采石工地，离市区有三十多里路，百货公司汉阳门市部的职工每天背了货去供应给工人。在另一个离市区三十多里的工地，百货公司也设立了供应点。工人们就近买到了自己喜欢的胶鞋、球鞋等物品。
    支持灾区农民种植早熟作物
    河北省一九五四年受灾地区的供销合作社为了支持灾民战胜春荒，积极把大批早熟作物种籽供应给农民。到三月十日止，仅据天津、保定、通县、沧县、石家庄等五个专区的不完全统计，供应到农民手中的春麦、大麦、豌豆等早熟作物种籽，已经有九百三十多万斤。受灾较重的清苑县，供销合作社还根据当地农民的种植习惯，从外地购买了三千多斤豆角、北瓜、茴香等早熟菜种。
    许多灾区供销合作社为了帮助农民除治虫害，保证作物全苗，在供应种籽的同时，注意供应了拌种用的农药。安新县供销合作社及时把二千五百多斤赛力散运到基层供应单位，供应农民拌种使用，受到农民的欢迎。宝坻县供销合作社还设立了九个药剂拌种站，帮助农民拌种。　（王英民）
    请农民鉴定生产资料
    辽宁省义县第三区羊圈子村供销合作社，在最近举办了一个生产资料鉴定展览会。参加展览会的有附近三十七个农业生产合作社的主任，县内各编织、铁工、皮革手工业生产合作社的代表和县供销合作社的干部。展览会上陈列着花轮车、铡刀、铁锨、铁镐、铧子、皮革和绳套等三百多种手工业产品。供销合作社干部将各种产品的规格、价格等向观众做了详细的说明。参观以后，举行了座谈会。座谈时，各农业生产合作社主任对铲?机、抬筐等产品提出了三十九条改进意见。另外，对供销合作社在组织进货和保管物资等工作方面的缺点也提出了批评。会上，有三十一个农业生产合作社同供销合作社订立了关于供应生产资料的合同和协议。最后，供销合作社根据各农业生产合作社和农民们的实际需要，修订了原来的春耕物资供应计划，并同手工业生产合作社签订了定货合同。　（赵麟）
    加强粮食供应工作
    洞庭湖堤垸整修工程即将全部竣工了。为了支援滨湖地区的农民顺利地恢复生产，湖南省常德专署根据生产季节的消费情况，对这些受灾地区，在原定粮食供应指标以外，加拨了一批粮食。各地粮食部门正在积极改进供应工作，把粮食及时供应到农民手中。为了使农民不耽误生产时间，许多粮食供应点实行了“连带上班制”。从每天清早六点多钟起，直到晚间八、九点钟，群众随时都能买到粮食。益阳县六个区已经增设了粮食流动供应点，并在几个供应量较大的供应点增加了工作人员。汉寿县利用湖泊、港?等交通条件，用船只有计划地分乡、分村、分片运粮供应。　（王英锦）
    营业员送货下乡
    湖北省随县第三区塔湾镇供销合作社为了支持春耕生产，除组织小商贩挑油下乡和作好集日的门市供应工作外，最近又采用“冷集送货”的办法，把生产资料和生活资料送到农民手里。现在，参加送货下乡工作的有十四个营业员，分成七个小组。据二月十九日到二十五日的统计，这七个组共下乡二十八次，每次都供应一百多万元（旧币，下同）的货物，收购的土产共值一百零九亿元。这些送货小组很受农民欢迎。他们下乡送的货原来有布匹、杂货等几种，现在已经根据群众需要，增加了小百货、食盐和犁铧等多种。　（许大坚）
    积极组织地方杂肥
      四川省许多地区的供销合作社积极组织地方杂肥。配合春耕，全省将供应农民各种杂肥一百多万担。
    各地供销合作社在一九五四年冬天便大力储备杂肥。奉节县第一区供销合作社到二月底止，已经储备和供应各种杂肥一百多万斤。酆都县第一区供销合作社除准备了大量毛发、大粪和草木灰以外，还准备收集大约九万斤榨菜皮子，供农民沤肥。泸州市供销合作社肥料站在今年第一季度仅人粪尿一项，就可以组织供应一千七百三十五万斤。目前，各地正大力将杂肥供应给农民。　（田祈雨）
    大批夏季布匹运到新疆
    中国花纱布公司新疆省公司为了及时供应新疆省各族人民春夏季需要的呢绒布匹，在一九五四年第四季度就同上海、天津、广州等地的生产单位签订了供应合同，并从十二月份起，提前由内地调进数百种商品。今年调进的畅销商品一般都比一九五四年同时期增加一倍以上，如灯芯绒调进量比一九五四年同时期增加了五倍，达克纱布比一九五四年同时期增加了三倍。今年还增加了新品种，有网眼布、劳动布和少数民族妇女喜爱的裙子布等。这些货物一般都在一月底前后运到了乌鲁木齐市。中国花纱布公司新疆省公司已经根据同各地签订的调拨供应合同，及时把这些货物调拨给基层供应单位。
    美观的春装和消费者见面
    中国百货公司沈阳市公司布匹呢绒商店里最近摆出了大批美观的春装。劳动布两用青年装、色呢坤马甲、和平呢西装、各色灯芯绒童装和罩衣等，吸引住了无数消费者的眼光。
      一对青年夫妇走进商店来，想买料子做件女西装裤。商店的售货员拿出华达呢女西装裤向他们介绍道：“今年我们做的春装不仅材料好，样式漂亮，而且活也做得结实，连裤兜的插口上下都是用针仔细锁的。比您买料子自己做，又快、又好、又省钱。”这两位顾客被售货员的一番话说得心动了，决定买了一条华达呢女西装裤。铁西区某工厂的一位职工从这里买了一件劳动布两用上衣。他的一个邻居见了很赞赏，认为上班时穿劳动布的，下班时可以穿蓝布的，挺不错，于是也去买了一件。　（杨庆章）
