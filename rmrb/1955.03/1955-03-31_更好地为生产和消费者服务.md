Mobile Trade Groups Active in Yumen Oilfield

    The mobile trade groups active in the construction sites, employee dormitories, and entertainment venues of the Yumen Oilfield in Gansu Province are enthusiastically serving the employees and their families. Construction sites such as Baiyanghe and Qingcaowan are about 20 kilometers away from the mining area, and it used to be very inconvenient for employees to buy things. The state-owned trading company in the Yumen Oilfield sent mobile trade groups here, which made the employees very happy. They vacated rooms for the mobile trade groups to operate, used cars to help the mobile trade groups transport goods, and some even brought boiling water to the trade groups and helped light the stove. The salespersons of the mobile trade groups actively supplied various goods according to the needs of the employees. Until 1:00 a.m., workers on the night shift could still buy pastries.
    Employee dormitories and cultural entertainment venues are also places that mobile trade groups frequently visit. Salespersons from the vegetable departments of the Zhongping District and Nanping District Trading Companies load melons, fruits, and frozen chickens onto carts and sell them at the skating rink and theater entrances. The Donggang Trading Company's retail department also delivers sweets to entertainment venues such as cinemas.

Supply Points on Basic Construction Sites

    The Wuhan Municipal Company of the China General Merchandise Company has set up eleven fixed supply points and two mobile supply groups on basic construction sites. They started with only over a hundred kinds of goods, but now they have over two hundred kinds. Items like toothbrushes, soap, towels, enamel basins, rubber shoes, work gloves, and diaries can all be bought nearby at the construction site supply stations.
    The salespersons' service slogan is: "Wherever the workers go, we will supply them there." The Xiann√ºshan quarry construction site in Hanyang is more than 30 miles away from the city. Employees from the Hanyang retail department of the General Merchandise Company carry goods every day to supply the workers. The General Merchandise Company has also set up a supply point at another construction site more than 30 miles away from the city. The workers can buy their favorite rubber shoes, sneakers, and other items nearby.

Supporting Farmers in Disaster Areas to Plant Early-Maturing Crops

    In order to support the disaster-stricken farmers in Hebei Province in 1954 to overcome the spring famine, the supply and marketing cooperatives actively supplied a large number of early-maturing crop seeds to the farmers. As of March 10, according to incomplete statistics from only five special districts, including Tianjin, Baoding, Tongxian, Cangxian, and Shijiazhuang, more than 9.3 million jin of early-maturing crop seeds such as spring wheat, barley, and peas have been supplied to the farmers. In Qingyuan County, which was severely affected by the disaster, the supply and marketing cooperatives also purchased more than 3,000 jin of early-maturing vegetable seeds such as cowpeas, North China pumpkins, and fennel from other places, according to the local farmers' planting habits.
    In order to help farmers eliminate pests and ensure full seedling emergence, many supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas paid attention to supplying pesticides for seed dressing while supplying seeds. The Anxin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative promptly transported more than 2,500 jin of Ceresan to the grassroots supply units for farmers to use for seed dressing, which was welcomed by the farmers. The Baodi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also set up nine medicine seed dressing stations to help farmers dress seeds. (Wang Yingmin)

Inviting Farmers to Evaluate Means of Production

    The Yangquanzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Third District of Yixian County, Liaoning Province, recently held an exhibition for the appraisal of means of production. The exhibition was attended by the directors of 37 agricultural production cooperatives in the vicinity, representatives of various weaving, ironworking, and leather handicraft production cooperatives in the county, and cadres of the county supply and marketing cooperative. The exhibition displayed more than 300 kinds of handicraft products such as flower carts, chaff cutters, iron shovels, iron picks, plows, leather, and ropes. Cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative gave detailed explanations of the specifications, prices, and other aspects of various products to the audience. After the visit, a discussion was held. During the discussion, the directors of the agricultural production cooperatives put forward 39 suggestions for improvement on products such as shovel machines and carrying baskets. In addition, they also criticized the shortcomings of the supply and marketing cooperative in organizing procurement and storing materials. At the meeting, 31 agricultural production cooperatives signed contracts and agreements with the supply and marketing cooperative regarding the supply of means of production. Finally, the supply and marketing cooperative revised the original spring plowing material supply plan according to the actual needs of the agricultural production cooperatives and the farmers, and signed order contracts with the handicraft production cooperatives.

Strengthening Grain Supply Work

    The Dongting Lake levee renovation project is nearing completion. In order to support the farmers in the lake area to smoothly resume production, the Changde Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hunan Province has allocated a batch of grain to these disaster-stricken areas in addition to the original grain supply quota, based on the consumption situation of the production season. Grain departments in various places are actively improving the supply work to deliver grain to the farmers in a timely manner. In order to prevent farmers from delaying production time, many grain supply points have implemented a "continuous work system." From 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. every day, the masses can buy grain at any time. Six districts in Yiyang County have added mobile grain supply points, and increased staff at several supply points with larger supply volumes. Hanshou County uses transportation conditions such as lakes and ports to transport grain to supply villages and areas in a planned way by boat. (Wang Yingjin)

Salespersons Delivering Goods to the Countryside

    In order to support spring plowing production, the Tawan Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Third District of Suixian County, Hubei Province, in addition to organizing small vendors to carry oil to the countryside and doing a good job in market supply, has recently adopted the method of "delivering goods on non-market days" to deliver means of production and means of livelihood to the farmers. At present, 14 salespersons are participating in the work of delivering goods to the countryside, divided into seven groups. According to statistics from February 19 to 25, these seven groups went to the countryside 28 times, each time supplying more than 1 million yuan (old currency, same below) of goods, and purchasing local products worth a total of 1.09 billion yuan. These delivery groups are very popular among the farmers. The goods they deliver to the countryside originally included several types such as cloth and groceries, but now they have increased to include small general merchandise, salt, and plowshares according to the needs of the masses.

Actively Organizing Local Miscellaneous Fertilizers

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas of Sichuan Province are actively organizing local miscellaneous fertilizers. In coordination with spring plowing, the province will supply farmers with more than 1 million dan of various miscellaneous fertilizers.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places vigorously stored miscellaneous fertilizers in the winter of 1954. The First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengjie County had stored and supplied more than 1 million jin of various miscellaneous fertilizers by the end of February. In addition to preparing a large amount of hair, manure, and plant ash, the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengdu County also plans to collect about 90,000 jin of pickled mustard tuber peel for farmers to compost. The fertilizer station of the Luzhou Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative can organize and supply 17.35 million jin of human manure alone in the first quarter of this year. At present, various places are vigorously supplying miscellaneous fertilizers to farmers. (Tian Qiyu)

Large Quantities of Summer Fabrics Arrive in Xinjiang

    In order to timely supply the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province with the woolen fabrics needed for spring and summer, the Xinjiang Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company signed supply contracts with production units in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places in the fourth quarter of 1954, and advanced the import of hundreds of kinds of commodities from the mainland from December. The volume of best-selling commodities imported this year has generally increased by more than double compared with the same period in 1954. For example, the import volume of corduroy has increased by five times compared with the same period in 1954, and dacron gauze has increased by three times compared with the same period in 1954. New varieties have also been added this year, including mesh fabric, labor cloth, and skirt fabrics favored by ethnic minority women. These goods generally arrived in Urumqi City around the end of January. The Xinjiang Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company has promptly allocated these goods to grassroots supply units according to the allocation supply contracts signed with various places.

Beautiful Spring Clothing Meets Consumers

    A large number of beautiful spring clothes have recently been displayed in the cloth and woolen fabric store of the Shenyang Municipal Company of the China General Merchandise Company. Labor cloth dual-purpose youth suits, woolen vests, Peace woolen suits, various colored corduroy children's clothing, and smocks have attracted the eyes of countless consumers.
    A young couple walked into the store and wanted to buy fabric to make a pair of women's slacks. The salesperson of the store took out gabardine women's slacks and introduced them to them: "The spring clothes we make this year are not only made of good materials and beautiful styles, but also made of sturdy workmanship. Even the insertion points of the trouser pockets are carefully locked with needles. It is faster, better, and saves money than buying fabric and making it yourself." These two customers were moved by the salesperson's words and decided to buy a pair of gabardine women's slacks. An employee of a factory in Tiexi District bought a labor cloth dual-purpose top here. A neighbor of his praised it very much, thinking that it was great to wear labor cloth when going to work and blue cloth when getting off work, so he also went to buy one. (Yang Qingzhang)
