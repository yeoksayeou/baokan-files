　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held a meeting on the 29th to discuss the economic situation in Asia.

　　Soviet representative, Mr. Menshikov, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that many countries within the region of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, particularly India, Indonesia, and Burma, are striving to develop peaceful and independent national economies, and are working to overcome the consequences of long-term colonial rule by imperialism. The Soviet Union is very sympathetic to these countries' desire to develop their national economies, especially to develop their industries in order to consolidate their independence.

　　Menshikov pointed out that most countries in this region are still suffering from serious economic difficulties, which are largely due to the policies of the United States. Menshikov pointed out that the economies of some countries in this region are being militarized, and their economies are subordinate to the interests of American monopoly capital. He further emphasized that the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9 and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma aim to guarantee peace throughout the world and to expand peaceful cooperation among all countries.

　　Menshikov concluded by saying: The Soviet delegation is authorized to declare here that the relevant departments of the Soviet Union can, at the request of countries in the Asia and Far East Economic Commission region, properly consider the specific requirements put forward by these countries for providing them with technical assistance in all aspects of economic development, believing that assistance can be provided to these countries by sending Soviet experts to these countries, by providing technical design drawings and samples of Soviet equipment, and by sending experts from these countries to the Soviet Union to improve their technical level. The funds needed for these aspects can be paid from the funds allocated by the Soviet Union to the United Nations Technical Assistance Fund for underdeveloped countries.

    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议讨论亚洲经济状况
    苏联代表声明愿给予本地区国家技术援助
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社东京讯：联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会二十九日举行会议，讨论亚洲经济状况。
    苏联代表曼希科夫在会上发言。他指出，联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会地区内许多国家，特别是印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸，正在努力发展和平和独立的国民经济，努力克服帝国主义长期殖民统治所造成的后果。苏联对于这些国家的发展国民经济、首先是发展工业以巩固自己独立的这种愿望，是非常同情的。
    曼希科夫指出这个区域里大多数国家依旧遭到严重的经济困难，这些困难在很大程度上是由于美国的政策造成的。曼希科夫指出，这个地区内某些国家的经济正在军事化，它们的经济服从美国垄断资本的利益。他进一步着重地说，苏联最高苏维埃二月九日的宣言和由中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸三国总理倡导的和平共处的五项原则，目的是保障全世界的和平，扩大所有国家的和平合作。
    曼希科夫最后说：苏联代表团受权在这里声明，苏联的有关部门，可以根据亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家的请求，妥善考虑这些国家提出来的在发展经济的各方面向它们提供技术援助的具体要求，认为可以用派遣苏联专家到这些国家去的办法，用提供技术设计图和苏联设备样品的办法，以及用由这些国家派遣专家到苏联提高他们的技术水平的办法，来援助这些国家。这些方面需要的款项，可以从联合国技术援助落后国家基金中苏联拨交的款项下支付。
