To ensure the health of resource exploration personnel in the Qaidam Basin, the Qinghai Provincial Health Department plans to expand the Chahanwusu health center into a people's hospital and the Golmud health clinic into a health center this year. The two hospitals plan to construct more than 1,000 square meters of housing this year, and add beds, surgical medical equipment, and laboratory equipment. In addition, the Qinghai Provincial Health Department is also preparing to organize a medical work team in May to go deep into the construction sites to conduct mobile medical services and help the medical staff of various exploration teams solve difficult problems. Recently, the Qinghai Provincial Health Department has allocated more than 200 pieces of surgical medical equipment. (Xinhua News Agency)

    青海扩大柴达木盆地医疗机构
    为保障柴达木盆地资源勘察人员的身体健康，青海省卫生厅今年计划把察汗乌苏的卫生院扩大为人民医院，把格尔穆的卫生所改为卫生院。这两个医院今年计划修建一千多平方公尺的房屋，并增设病床、外科医疗器械和化验设备。另外，青海省卫生厅还准备在五月间组织一个医疗工作队，深入工地进行巡回医疗，帮助各勘察工作队的医务人员解决疑难问题。最近青海省卫生厅已拨下外科医疗器械二百多件。  （新华社）
