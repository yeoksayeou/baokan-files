Ganyu County, Jiangsu Province, is located east of the Yellow Sea, and saline-alkali land is distributed throughout the county. This soil is neither drought-resistant nor waterlogging-resistant. Even in years of good harvest without disasters, planting wheat, sorghum and other crops yields at most about 100 jin per mu. Peanuts and sweet potatoes simply do not grow, and some alkaline land is barren year-round.

For many years, farmers have known that pressing sand is a good way to improve saline-alkali soil, but with individual household production, everyone felt unable to do enough. In the past two years, the newly established Patriotic Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Second District Central Agricultural Production Cooperative, etc., began to press sand on small plots of saline-alkali land, and the yield per mu increased by about double compared to land without sand. This year, more farmers throughout the county have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and they not only have the strength to improve the soil themselves, but also motivated the surrounding farmers, setting off a surge of piling river sand to press alkaline land. Four hundred and thirty-seven cooperatives plan to improve more than 7,700 mu of soil this spring. According to statistics from 219 agricultural production cooperatives in six districts, more than 4,900 mu of soil have been improved, and more than 199,000 cartloads of sand have been pressed.

    赣榆农民压河沙改良碱地
    江苏省赣榆县东临黄海，盐碱土地分布全县。这种土质既不耐旱，又不耐涝，就是在无灾丰收的年景，种上小麦、高粱等作物，产量至多不过一百斤左右，花生、山芋等根本不长，有些碱土地终年荒芜。
    许多年来，农民们都知道压沙是改良盐碱土的好办法，但是一家一户生产，大家心有余力不足。前两年，新成立的爱国农业生产合作社和二区中心农业生产合作社等，开始在小块盐碱地上压沙，每亩地都比不压沙的增产一倍左右。今年，全县农民参加农业生产合作社的增多了，他们不仅自己有力量改良土壤，而且带动了周围农民，掀起堆河沙压碱地的热潮。四百三十七个社计划今春改良土壤七千七百多亩。现在据六个区二百十九个农业生产合作社统计，已完成改良土壤四千九百多亩，压沙十九万九千多车。
