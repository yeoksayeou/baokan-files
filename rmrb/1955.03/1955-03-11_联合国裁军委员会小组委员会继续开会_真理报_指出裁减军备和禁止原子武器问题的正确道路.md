Xinhua News Agency, London, March 9th: TASS reports: According to an official communique, the Subcommittee of the UN Disarmament Commission held a meeting on March 8th, chaired by Gromyko. The Subcommittee is continuing its work. The next meeting is scheduled for March 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 9th: TASS reports: "Pravda" published an observer's article discussing the necessity of establishing effective international supervision to oversee the work of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The article points out that, given that freeing the people of all countries from the threat of atomic war is the basic task of the United Nations, since the founding of the UN, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated for general arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, the United States, Britain, and France have obstructed the reaching of corresponding international agreements on this issue. At the same time, the rulers of these three countries, fearing that their obstructive actions would arouse public indignation, have distorted the truth and attempted to prove that it is the Soviet Union, not them, that is obstructing the reaching of an agreement. When Churchill recently delivered a speech in the British House of Commons, in order to defend the arms race policy pursued by the Conservative government, he even went so far as to say that the Soviet Union opposes any practical and feasible international supervision system. However, in fact, it is not the Soviet Union, but precisely the United States and other Western countries that oppose genuine international supervision over the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and arms reduction.

In fact, since the presentation of the notorious Baruch Plan in 1946, the United States' attitude on this issue has not changed. The Baruch Plan stipulates the establishment of an "international control agency" that not only occupies all countries' various atomic raw materials, atomic plants, and other enterprises related to the production of atomic energy, but also has the right to interfere in these countries' internal affairs. This plan makes no provision whatsoever for prohibiting the use of atomic energy for military purposes.

As for the Soviet Union, it starts from the premise that the international supervisory agency should not become a supranational organization, an occupier of all countries' atomic raw materials and atomic plants, as the United States hopes.

The Soviet Union's proposals stipulate that the international supervisory agency be granted the powers necessary to ensure strict supervision of all institutions engaged in the extraction of atomic raw materials and the production of atomic materials and atomic energy, and that the international supervisory agency has the right to require any country to provide materials and explanations regarding the extraction of atomic raw materials and the production of atomic materials and atomic energy (these materials and explanations are necessary for the supervision of the use of atomic energy). The Soviet proposals also stipulate that the international supervisory agency should also have the right to submit recommendations to the United Nations Security Council regarding the adoption of warnings and sanctions against countries that violate the agreement. The decisions of the international supervisory agency will be adopted by a majority vote, without the use of the veto power. Finally, the Soviet proposals advocate that the implementation of measures to prohibit atomic weapons should be simultaneous with the establishment of supervision over such measures.

The article concludes by writing that one cannot fail to see that the Soviet Union's attitude is realistic. The Soviet Union's proposals guarantee the implementation of the necessary strict international supervision without infringing on the sovereignty of any country. These proposals open the only correct and feasible path to solving the problem of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会继续开会
    “真理报”指出裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的正确道路
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社伦敦九日讯：据正式公报，三月八日，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在葛罗米柯担任主席下举行了会议。小组委员会在继续工作。下次会议定三月九日举行。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：“真理报”刊载观察家的一篇文章，论述建立有效的国际监督来监督裁减军备和禁止原子武器的工作的必要性。
    文章指出，鉴于使各国人民免于原子战争威胁是联合国的基本任务，自从联合国成立以来，苏联就坚持不渝地主张普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器。但是，美国、英国和法国阻挠在这个问题上达成相应的国际协议。同时，这三国的统治者担心他们的阻挠行动引起群情愤慨，于是颠倒黑白，企图证明阻挠达成协议的是苏联而不是他们。邱吉尔最近在英国下院发表演说时，为了替保守党政府奉行的军备竞赛政策辩解，竟然说什么苏联反对任何实际可行的国际监督制度。然而事实上，反对对禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备的工作实行真正的国际监督的，不是苏联而正是美国和其他西方国家。
    事实上，自从一九四六年提出臭名远扬的巴鲁克计划以来，美国在这个问题上的态度就一直没有改变。巴鲁克计划规定建立一个“国际管制机构”，这个机构不但要占有所有国家的各种原子原料、原子工厂以及其他同生产原子能有关的企业，而且还有权干涉这些国家的内政。这个计划丝毫没有规定禁止把原子能用于军事目的。
    至于苏联，它是从这样一个前提出发的：国际监督机构不应该像美国所希望的那样成为一个超国家的机构，一个所有国家的原子原料和原子工厂的占有者。
    苏联的建议规定，赋予国际监督机构以保证对一切从事原子原料的开采和原子物质和原子能的生产的机构进行严格的监督所必需的权力，规定国际监督机构有权要求任何国家提供关于原子原料的开采和原子物质、原子能的生产的材料和说明（这些材料和说明对于监督原子能的利用是必需的）。苏联的建议还规定，国际监督机构同时应该有权向联合国安全理事会提出关于对违反协议的国家采取警告和制裁措施的建议。国际监督机构的决定将以多数票通过，不得使用否决权。最后，苏联的建议主张禁止原子武器的措施的实施同建立对这种措施的监督应该是同时的。
    文章最后写道，人们不能不看到，苏联的态度是现实的。苏联的建议保证实行必要的严格的国际监督而不侵犯任何国家的主权。这些建议打开了解决裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的唯一正确可行的道路。
