Xinhua News Agency:

    Sichuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Chongqing Supply Station discovered that slag discarded by steel factories contains a large amount of phosphorus. As long as the slag is crushed into fine powder, it can be used as phosphate fertilizer. According to analysis, the average phosphorus content of general slag is 5% to 10%. The Southwest Agricultural College, Southwest Agricultural Science Research Institute and other units have conducted preliminary pot and field tests with this fertilizer, and the results are good. Wheat fertilized with this slag by the Southwest Agricultural Science Research Institute grew almost as well as wheat fertilized with phosphate rock.
    The amount of slag is relatively large, and it used to be discarded as waste. Now, using it to produce fertilizer has low costs and simple production equipment, opening up an important source of fertilizer for agricultural production. Recently, the Sichuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Chongqing Supply Station has begun to use road rollers to make fertilizer from slag, and has entrusted some joint state-private factories to start small-scale production. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives in Shanghai, Xi'an, North China and other places have also sent cadres to understand the production situation and learn from the experience.

### 四川试用炉渣代替磷肥

    四川试用炉渣代替磷肥
    四川省供销合作社重庆供销站发现钢铁厂废弃的炉渣含有大量磷质，只要把炉渣压成细粉末，就可当磷肥施用。据分析，一般炉渣平均含磷的成分有百分之五到百分之十。西南农学院、西南农业科学研究所等单位曾用这种肥料初步作了盆植和田间试验，效果良好。西南农业科学研究所用这种肥料施过的小麦，生长情况和施磷矿肥的效果差不多。
    炉渣数量较大，过去都作为废物弃置。现在用作生产肥料，成本低，生产设备也很简单，为农业生产开辟了重要的肥源。最近四川省供销合作社重庆供销站已开始用压路机把炉渣自制肥料，并委托一部分公私合营工厂开始小量的生产。中华全国供销合作总社、上海、西安、华北等地的供销合作社也已派了干部前来了解生产情况和学习经验。
