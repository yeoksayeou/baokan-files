    At the Sixth Session of the Polish People's Republic Sejm
    Cyrankiewicz Delivers Government Foreign Policy Report

    Polish Minister of Council Chairman Cyrankiewicz delivered a report on the foreign policy of the Polish People's Republic government at the sixth session of the Sejm on March 16th.

    Cyrankiewicz said that the great concern shown by our people for the development of the international situation and the great enthusiasm they have displayed in the struggle for peace are the most convincing proof that our people inextricably link their efforts to promote the all-round development of their country with the common cause of the entire international democratic and socialist camp – the struggle for peace.

    Cyrankiewicz said that People's Poland, whose foreign policy reflects the vital interests and deepest sentiments of all the people, has in the past and is now contributing to the strengthening of world peace and the promotion of friendly relations between the peoples of all countries in all aspects of international cooperation. Cooperating with other countries, striving to ease international tensions, and actively participating in eliminating the hotbeds of war danger – these are the guiding principles of the Polish government's foreign policy.

    We have ended our state of war with Germany. We are developing friendly relations with our neighboring countries, the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia. We are ready to normalize our relations with West Germany. We are maintaining and expanding cooperation with our Baltic neighbors – the Scandinavian countries – with whom we have been trading almost from the first day of our independence. Poland has also taken an important step towards normalizing its relations with Yugoslavia.

    Far from Europe – in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, we are working for peace and freedom. We advocate normalizing our relations with Japan. We have consistently supported the proposition of expanding international commercial exchanges. We are actively working for the common cause of peace and our own interests in the United Nations and in many other international organizations in which we participate.

    We are active supporters of the idea of coexistence, and we are implementing the principle of cooperation in all fields with all countries, regardless of their political and economic systems.

    Last year, the peace camp and the forces of peace around the world achieved some important victories. The slogan of easing international tensions put forward by the peace camp has aroused a wide response in world opinion. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for those governments that are adjusting their foreign policies according to the tune of the conductors in Washington, or, to put it more precisely, for those governments that are accepting Washington's orders. However, thanks to the firm, wise, and tenacious efforts of the diplomatic front of our camp, first and foremost the Soviet Union and People's China, the international situation has achieved a certain degree of relaxation.

    The Geneva Accords and the earlier armistice in Korea, achieved a year earlier, have made it possible to end two wars – the Korean War and the Indochina War. Peaceful coexistence has a real prospect.

    But the imperialist bloc, primarily the imperialist blocs of the United States, Britain, and France, and naturally the imperialists of West Germany, have reached completely different conclusions. The success of the method of consultation, the easing of international tensions, and the increasing pressure of public opinion demanding disarmament and, above all, the prohibition of cruel thermonuclear weapons, have aroused alarm and anger in the imperialist bloc. They have begun to intensify the movement aimed at exacerbating international tensions. The imperialist blocs of the United States and Britain have begun to redouble their efforts to revive West German imperialism. Indeed, they suffered a very serious blow on this path, which was the final burial of the so-called European Army and the European Defense Community; but they immediately used all their pressure in order to crush the resistance of the French people. The process of repeated votes in the French Parliament on the ratification of the Paris Accords shows the intensity and barbarity of this pressure.

    The countries of the peace camp certainly cannot passively sit by and watch this attempt to revive a deadly threat to peace in the heart of Europe in the form of a rebuilt German Wehrmacht. The Soviet government has repeatedly issued warnings and put forward concrete and constructive proposals aimed at resolving the German question through negotiation, restoring Germany's unity, and concluding a peace treaty with that country.

    Cyrankiewicz then said that the Polish government has never for a moment relaxed its efforts aimed at opposing the revival of German militarism and the division of Germany.

    In declarations to the major powers and to Germany's neighbors, the Polish government has repeatedly warned of the dangers that the revival of German militarism would bring to peace in Europe and the world.

    The Polish government has particularly warmly supported the Soviet initiative to convene a conference of European countries to consider the issue of ensuring peace and security in Europe. The Polish government delegation actively participated in that meeting held in Moscow last November and December. The great significance of that meeting and its results cannot but affect the development of events in Europe.

    Cyrankiewicz said that the overwhelming majority of the French people firmly oppose the practice of rearming France's mortal enemy. The majority of the German people also reject the militarism that American imperialism has imposed on Germany. Moreover, serious dissatisfaction and unease are growing in British public opinion.

    Cyrankiewicz continued: Our clear peace attitude, our willingness to negotiate on the German question – of course, on the condition of abandoning the practice of remilitarization – is being abused by many Western politicians as an argument to insist that their claims about "negotiating from a position of strength" or "achieving peace through strength" are correct. There is nothing more hypocritical than this assertion. These politicians are deceiving themselves, and they are indeed deceiving public opinion in their own countries.

    Cyrankiewicz continued that the responsible politicians of our camp have very firmly declared that our response to the remilitarization of West Germany will be to take steps to safeguard our country, to prevent any and every attempt to violate our security or borders. On this issue, one must not deceive oneself, nor must one be complacent. The relations between us and the German Democratic Republic, based on the principles of cooperation and friendship, and on the inviolability of our Oder-Neisse border, have shown that we are able to establish good-neighborly, friendly, and peaceful relations with the German people. The Polish government will persevere in its efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the German question in accordance with the interests of Poland's peace and security, and in accordance with the interests of the peoples of all European countries.

    Cyrankiewicz said: The contradictions within the Atlantic bloc are becoming increasingly apparent due to the situation in the Far East.

    The adventurous warmongering clique in the United States has never for a moment abandoned their attempts. The failures they suffered at the Geneva Conference made them restrain themselves for a short period.

    But we are now seeing them attempting to launch irresponsible actions of aggression in the Far East. The American warmongering clique, using their Chiang Kai-shek puppet, are carrying out an unpredictable and dangerous policy of provocation against People's China.

    People's China's right to Taiwan is indisputable. They have both the basis of binding international agreements and the basis of the principles of reason and justice.

    Because everyone knows very well that if it were not for the intervention of the American army, that American puppet Chiang Kai-shek, whose hands are stained with blood, would not be able to stay in Taiwan for even an hour. Of course, the dream of restoring the previous colonial situation in Asia is just a pipe dream, but this dream carries the danger of provoking new armed conflicts in the Far East.

    But the situation in the Far East is not developing entirely according to the plans of those who are bent on launching aggression.

    The opposition of those countries that do not want imperialists to interfere in their politics is becoming increasingly strong.

    In this regard, the attitudes of the governments of India, Burma, and Indonesia are particularly representative. They have accepted the principles of peaceful coexistence as the basis of their foreign policy.

    In speaking of the efforts of the Southeast Asian people, one cannot but emphasize the role played by India, which has recently made important contributions to the peaceful settlement of Asian issues. It must be pointed out that relations between Poland and India have recently strengthened, as manifested in the mutual exchange of ambassadors between the two countries and the continuous expansion of cultural exchanges and commercial ties.

    Our harmonious relations with Asian countries are manifested in the development of our economic relations with countries in the Far East, the Middle East, and the Near East.

    But our concern for the Far Eastern issues is not limited to the regions mentioned above. Despite difficult conditions and the discrimination and provocations of the Syngman Rhee authorities, the Polish representatives have been solemnly and selflessly carrying out, for more than a year and a half, the task we have undertaken together with other countries, which is to supervise the implementation of the Korean armistice terms.

    The Polish government believes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can play an important and positive role in the task of maintaining peace in Korea, and therefore opposes any attempt to dissolve this commission, considering it a violation of the armistice agreement.

    Polish representatives are participating in the work of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commissions in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, helping to implement the Geneva Accords and stabilize peace in that region of Asia. This is the active role we are playing in resolving international disputes.

    It is enough to compare these events with the ridiculous Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting recently held in Bangkok, Thailand. This so-called Asian treaty does not have the support of any important Asian country.

    The same is true in the Near East, where Mr. Dulles's attempt to establish an aggressive organization in that region has been resolutely opposed by Asian countries.

    The theory of colonialism – no matter what form it takes – is definitely a thing of the past. Those who do not understand this are likely to suffer great losses.

    The American aggressive clique playing with fire in Taiwan and the coastal islands of mainland China has recently become particularly arrogant. They are threatening with nuclear weapons. But, as everyone knows, Soviet science and technology has made great achievements in this regard, and therefore any clamor about American superiority is nothing more than an empty fantasy.

    Obviously, the Soviet Union is ready at any time to hold talks to conclude an international agreement on the prohibition and destruction of all stockpiles of nuclear weapons, which it has repeatedly announced publicly. But in the United States, and recently in Britain, the practice of threatening with hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs has become very frequent again.

    It is surprising that the British Prime Minister recently participated in this dangerous game. Was it not Sir Winston Churchill who once said that he was not made Prime Minister of Britain to liquidate the Empire? Could he be planning to carry out – as British newspapers are currently often saying – an act of "national suicide"?

    It is becoming increasingly clear that our people will not be intimidated by the threat of atomic or hydrogen bombs. Their struggle is clearly manifested in the mass peace movement and in the reaction aroused by the recent appeals of the World Peace Council.

    Cyrankiewicz said that, however, the most important factor in defeating the policy of intimidation with weapons of mass destruction is the unwavering peace policy of the socialist camp, especially the Soviet Union.

    At the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, we heard the words full of strength and confidence in people and humanity from the leaders of the party and government, and this session was a powerful proof of the Soviet Union's peace policy.

    The Polish people, through the Presidium of the Sejm and the Council of State, have particularly warmly supported the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on establishing close ties between the parliaments of all countries.

    According to the international situation, we can clearly say that Poland's international status has been further strengthened. Poland's international status has become more important, primarily due to our alliance with the Soviet Union, due to Poland's friendly relations with People's China (which were further strengthened last year by Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Warsaw and the visit of the Polish government delegation headed by Comrade Bolesław Bierut to Beijing), and due to friendly relations with the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These relations are characterized by common goals, mutual respect for sovereignty, and fraternal mutual assistance.

    People's Poland is a strong link in the chain of peace forces. The alliance with the Soviet Union has enabled newborn Poland to gain its due position on the world stage. Due to the economic and political changes caused by the victory of the Polish people over reactionary forces and the historic victory of the Soviet Union over fascism, it has become possible for Poland to adopt an independent and truly national policy.

    Cyrankiewicz continued, saying that today, our borders and the fruits of our peaceful labor are not only protected by our own army, but also by the entire powerful peace camp, in which Poland's freedom and independence and the inviolability of Poland's borders are a matter of common concern.

    Cyrankiewicz then said, looking forward to the tenth anniversary of the treaty signed between us and the Soviet Union, I would like to say to the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union now here that we consider their visit to Poland to be evidence of the continued strengthening of the friendship between our peoples and a manifestation of our two countries' joint efforts to strengthen world peace. We declare that Polish public opinion considers this treaty to be permanent, to guarantee our independence and territorial integrity, and considers this treaty to be the cornerstone of our entire policy.

    Cyrankiewicz then talked about the economic and cultural development of People's Democratic Poland.

    在波兰人民共和国议会第六次会议上
    西伦凯维兹作政府外交政策报告
    波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹三月十六日在议会第六次会议上作了关于波兰人民共和国政府外交政策的报告。
    西伦凯维兹说，我国人民对国际形势的发展所表现的极大关怀和他们在争取和平的斗争中所表现的极大的积极性，是一个最令人信服的证据，证明我国人民把促进他们国家的全面发展的努力，同整个国际民主和社会主义阵营的共同事业——争取和平的斗争不可分地联系在一起。
    西伦凯维兹说，在外交政策上反映了全体人民的切身利益和最深刻的感情的人民波兰，过去和现在都在国际合作的各个方面对加强世界和平和促进各国人民之间的友好关系作出贡献。和其他国家合作、努力缓和国际紧张局势和积极参加消灭战争危险的温床——这就是波兰政府外交政策的指导方针。
    我们已经结束了我们对德国的战争状态。我们正在发展和我们接壤的邻国苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的友好关系。我们准备使我们和西德的关系正常化。我们正在保持和扩大同我们的波罗的海各邻国——斯堪的纳维亚国家——的合作，几乎从我们获得独立的第一天起，我们就一直在同这些国家进行贸易。波兰也采取了一个重要步骤来使它和南斯拉夫的关系正常化。
    在远离欧洲的地方——在朝鲜、越南、柬埔寨和老挝，我们正在为和平和自由而工作。我们主张使我们和日本的关系正常化。我们一贯支持扩大国际商业往来的主张。我们为共同的和平事业和我们自己在联合国以及许多其他我们参加了的国际组织中的利益而积极工作。
    我们是共处思想的积极支持者，我们正在实行同一切国家，不论它们的政治和经济制度如何，在各个方面进行合作的原则。
    去年，和平阵营和全世界的和平力量获得了一些重要的胜利。和平阵营所提出的缓和国际紧张局势的口号在世界舆论中引起了广泛的响应。不幸的是，对于那些正按照华盛顿指挥者的调音义来调整它们的外交政策的政府，或者说得更确切一些，对于那些接受华盛顿的命令的政府，就不能这样说了。然而，由于我们阵营的外交方面，首先是苏联和人民中国的外交方面的坚定、英明和顽强的努力，国际局势获得了某种程度的缓和。
    日内瓦协定和更早一年达成的朝鲜停战，已经使得两个战争——朝鲜战争和印度支那战争——得以结束。和平共处已有了真正的远景。
    但是，帝国主义集团，首先是美国、还有英国和法国的帝国主义集团，自然还有西德的帝国主义者们却得出完全不同的结论。协商方法的成功，国际紧张局势的缓和，公众要求裁减军备和首先是要求禁止残忍的热核子武器的越来越大的压力，这一切都引起了帝国主义集团的惊慌和愤怒。它们开始变本加厉地进行目的在于加剧国际紧张局势的运动。美国和英国的帝国主义集团开始加倍努力来复活西德帝国主义。的确，他们在这条道路上遭到了一个极严重的打击，这就是所谓欧洲军和欧洲防务集团的被最后埋葬；但是他们马上动用了一切压力，以便粉碎法兰西人民的抵抗。法国议会关于批准巴黎协定的一次接着一次的投票过程，表明了这种压力的强烈和蛮横。
    和平阵营国家当然不能消极地坐视这种在欧洲的心脏、以重建的德国国防军的形式来复活对和平的致命威胁的企图。苏联政府已屡次提出警告并且提出了目的在于用协商的办法解决德国问题、恢复德国的统一和同这个国家缔结和约的具体的建设性的建议。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，波兰政府从没有一刻松懈它的旨在反对德国军国主义的复活和德国分裂的努力。
    波兰政府在向各大国、向德国的各邻国发表的声明中一再提出警告，说明德国军国主义复活将为欧洲和全世界的和平带来的危险。
    波兰政府特别热烈地支持苏联关于召开欧洲国家的考虑保障欧洲和平和安全问题的会议的倡议。波兰政府代表团积极地参加了去年十一月到十二月在莫斯科举行的那次会议。那次会议的重大意义和它的结果不能不影响欧洲的事态发展。
    西伦凯维兹说，绝大多数的法国人民坚决地反对重新武装法国的死敌的做法。大多数德国人民也拒绝美帝国主义强加在德国身上的军国主义。而且，在英国舆论中严重的不满和不安情绪也在日益加强。
    西伦凯维兹接着说：我们的明确的和平态度、我们准备就德国问题进行谈判的态度——当然要以放弃重新军国主义化的做法为条件——，被西方的许多政客们滥用来作为这样一种论据：硬说他们关于“从实力出发进行谈判”，或是“通过实力实现和平”的主张是正确的。这种说法是再虚伪没有了。这些政客们是在欺骗他们自己，他们的确也是在欺骗他们国内的舆论。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，我们阵营的负责政治家们已非常坚决地宣布，我们对西德重新军国主义化的答复将是采取步骤来保障我们的国家，防止侵犯我们的安全或边境的一切企图和每一个企图。在这个问题上，决不能欺骗自己，也决不能庸人自扰。我们同德意志民主共和国之间的以合作和友好的原则、以及以我们的奥得—尼斯分界线的不可侵犯性为基础的关系，已表明我们能够同德国人民建立睦邻的、友好的和和平的关系。波兰政府将坚持不懈地努力，来争取根据波兰的和平和安全的利益、根据欧洲一切国家人民的利益，和平解决德国问题。
    西伦凯维兹说：大西洋集团内部的矛盾正由于远东的局势而变得日益明显。
    美国的冒险的战争贩子集团一时一刻也没有放弃过他们的企图。他们在日内瓦会议上遭受的失败使他们收敛了一个短时期。
    但是，我们现在又看到它们企图在远东发动侵略的不负责任的行动了。美国的战争贩子集团利用着他们的蒋介石傀儡，正在执行着一种向人民中国挑衅的无法预测的、危险的政策。
    人民中国对台湾的权利是无容争辩的。他们既有具有约束性的国际协定的根据，又有公理和正义的原则的根据。
    因为每一个人都知道得很清楚，要不是美国军队的干涉，那个双手沾满鲜血的美国傀儡蒋介石连一小时都不能留在台湾。当然，想在亚洲恢复以前的殖民地状况的迷梦只不过是空想，但是这种迷梦却带有可能在远东挑起新的武装冲突的危险。
    但是，远东的局势完全不是按照那些一心要发动侵略的人们的计划发展的。
    那些不愿让帝国主义者干涉它们的政治的国家的反对情绪正在变得日益强烈。
    在这方面，印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚政府的态度是特别具有代表性的。它们已经接受和平共处的原则作为它们外交政策的基础。
    在讲到东南亚人民的努力时，不能不着重指出印度所起的作用，印度最近时期对和平解决亚洲问题作了重要的贡献。必须指出，波兰和印度之间的关系最近已经加强，这表现在两国互派大使和不断地扩大文化交流和商务往来方面。
    我们和亚洲国家的和睦关系表现在我们同远东、中东和近东国家的经济关系的发展上。
    但是，我们对远东问题的关怀还不限于上面所讲到的这些地区。尽管条件困难和李承晚当局的歧视和挑衅，但波兰代表在一年半以上的时间以来一直在庄严地、无私地执行我们同其他国家一道承担的任务，这就是监督朝鲜停战条款的执行。
    波兰政府认为中立国监察委员会在维持朝鲜和平的任务中能起重要和积极的作用，因此，将反对任何解散这个委员会的企图，认为它是违反停战协定的。
    波兰代表参加了越南、老挝和柬埔寨的国际监督和监察委员会的工作，正在帮助执行日内瓦协定和稳定亚洲的那一地区的和平。这是我们在解决国际争端中所起的积极作用。
    只要把这些事件同最近在泰国曼谷举行的可笑的东南亚条约组织会议比较一下就够了。这个所谓的亚洲条约得不到任何重要的亚洲国家的支持。
    在近东也是一样，杜勒斯先生企图在那个地区成立一个侵略机构的做法遭到了亚洲国家的坚决反对。
    殖民主义的理论——不论是采取什么形式——肯定地是过去的事了。没有了解这一点的那些人是可能吃大亏的。
    在台湾和中国大陆沿海岛屿玩火的美国侵略集团最近特别嚣张。他们正在用核子武器来威胁。但是，大家知道，苏联的科学和技术已在这方面取得了巨大的成就，因此，关于美国优势的任何叫嚣都只不过是空洞的幻想而已。
    显然，苏联准备随时举行会谈来缔结关于禁止和销毁核子武器的一切储存的国际协定，关于这一点，它已屡次公开宣布了。但是，在美国和最近在英国，用氢弹和原子弹来进行威胁的作法又变得非常经常了。
    令人惊奇的是英国首相最近参加了这个危险的把戏。难道曾经说过他做英国首相不是为了使帝国消灭的不是邱吉尔爵士吗？难道他可能打算作出——如英国报纸目前所常常说的——“民族自杀”的行动吗？
    可以越来越明显地看出，我们的人民是不会被原子弹或氢弹的威胁所吓倒的。他们的斗争在大规模的和平运动中、在世界和平理事会最近的呼吁所引起的反应中明显地表现了出来。
    西伦凯维兹说，但是，击败用大规模毁灭性武器进行恫吓的政策的最重要的因素，却是社会主义阵营各国的，首先是苏联的坚持不渝的和平政策。
    在苏联最高苏维埃最近一次会议上，我们听到了党和政府的领导者的充满了力量的、以及对人和人类的信心的话，这次会议是苏联和平政策的有力的证明。
    波兰人民通过议会主席团和国务委员会特别热烈地支持苏联最高苏维埃关于建立各国议会间的密切联系的宣言。
    根据国际形势来看，我们能够明确地说，波兰的国际地位已经进一步加强了。波兰在国际的地位已经更加重要了，这首先是由于我们同苏联结成了联盟，由于波兰同人民中国的友好关系（这种关系去年已因周恩来总理访问华沙和以波·贝鲁特同志为首的波兰政府代表团访问北京而进一步加强），以及同德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国的友好关系。这些关系的特点是目标的共同性、互相尊重主权和兄弟般的互助。
    人民波兰是和平力量链条中的坚强的一环。同苏联结成的联盟已经使新生的波兰能够在世界舞台上取得应有的地位。由于波兰人民对反动势力取得的胜利和苏联对法西斯主义的历史性胜利而引起经济和政治的变化，波兰采取一种独立的和真正民族的政策便成为可能了。
    西伦凯维兹继续说，今天，我们的边疆和我们的和平劳动的果实不仅受到我们自己的军队的保护，而且也受到整个强大的和平阵营的保护，在这个阵营里，波兰的自由和独立以及波兰的疆界的不可侵犯性是一件大家共同关心的事情。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，瞻望着我们和苏联签订的条约的十周年，我愿意向现在在这里的苏联最高苏维埃代表团说，我们认为他们来波兰的访问是我们人民之间的友谊继续加强的证据和我们两国的加强世界和平的共同努力的表现。我们宣布：波兰舆论认为这个条约是永久性的，是保证我们的独立和领土完整的，并认为这个条约是我们全部政策的基石。
    西伦凯维兹接着谈到人民民主波兰的经济和文化发展。　　　　（新华社据波兰通讯社讯）
