New Achievements in Steel Industry Production

The situation of enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in completing the national production plan for five major products in February is as follows: iron ore 104.26, metallurgical coke 101.7, pig iron 101.79, steel 106.27, and steel products 95.37.

In February, many enterprises achieved new accomplishments in production. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant overcame difficulties in equipment and technology, successfully trial-smelting ferro-manganese, which is essential for steelmaking, in small blast furnaces, and is now producing it in large quantities. The Tianjin Steel Plant successfully trial-produced large flat steel, which is now in formal production and can supply the needs of railway construction. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant successfully trial-smelted two new steel grades, further providing new raw materials for industrial construction. Some units continued to promote the Soviet advanced experience of "thick-layer burning and patching furnace bottoms," and the hot repair time has been reduced. The Tianjin Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and Plants 101 and 104 shortened the hot repair time of open hearth furnaces by about 100 hours, which can increase steel production by about 500 tons. In addition, many units have also seen some new records in production. The Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 strengthened its scheduling for converters and shortened the auxiliary time, setting a new record of 143 heats blown per day on February 8, which is 7 heats higher than the previous record. The average daily output of pig iron of Benxi Iron and Steel Company increased by 4.67% compared with January, and a certain blast furnace set a new record of a utilization coefficient of 0.65 on the 19th.

During this month, blast furnaces in units such as the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant experienced nodule formation accidents, and the rolling mill of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 had a shaft fracture accident, which had a great impact on production.

    钢铁工业生产中的新成就
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业二月份五种主要产品完成国家生产计划的情况是：铁矿石一○四·二六，冶金焦一○一·七，生铁一○一·七九，钢一○六·二七，钢材九五·三七。
    二月份，许多企业在生产上取得了新的成就。石景山钢铁厂克服设备上和技术上的困难，在小高炉中试炼炼钢生产必需的锰铁，获得成功，现已大量生产。天津钢厂试制大型扁钢成功，已正式生产，可供应铁路建设的需要。太原钢铁厂试炼成功了两种新钢种，进一步为工业建设提供了新的原料。有些单位继续推行“厚层烧补炉底”的苏联先进经验，热修时间都有降低。天津钢厂、太原钢铁厂一○一和一○四厂平炉热修时间共缩短了一百小时左右，约可增产钢五百吨。此外，不少单位在生产上还出现了一些新纪录。上海钢铁一厂转炉加强了调度，缩短了辅助时间，在二月八日创日吹一百四十三炉新纪录，比过去纪录又提高了七炉；本溪钢铁公司生铁平均日产量比一月提高了百分之四·六七，某高炉在十九日创利用系数○·六五的新纪录。
    在这个月份里，太原钢铁厂等单位的高炉曾发生结瘤事故，上海钢铁三厂轧钢机发生断轴事故，对生产都有很大的影响。
