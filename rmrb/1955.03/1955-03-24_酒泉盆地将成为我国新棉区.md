The Jiuquan Basin in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province can be developed into one of China's new cotton regions. In 1954, the Central Northwest Land Reclamation and Cotton Planting Investigation Group and the Gansu Provincial State-owned Farm Survey Team conducted a preliminary survey in this basin. It is estimated that the area of arable wasteland suitable for cultivation in this basin is 2.5 million mu to 3 million mu. Most of it can be planted with cotton after reclamation. Relevant authorities in Gansu Province have put forward suggestions for land reclamation and cotton planting in this basin in the future based on the survey results.

The Jiuquan Basin is a flat wasteland centered on Jiuquan and extending to Dunhuang, with rivers such as the Heihe River, Shule River, and Danghe River flowing through it. The basin has abundant sunshine throughout the year, and the temperature and soil are suitable for cotton planting. Local farmers have a tradition of sporadically planting cotton over the years. Last year, the average yield of ginned cotton planted by farmers was 40 jin per mu without widespread improvement in varieties and cultivation techniques, with Dunhuang County averaging nearly 60 jin per mu. In the future, after large reservoirs and irrigation canals are built upstream of the Heihe River and other rivers to solve the problem of water use for cotton planting, large areas of wasteland can become high-yield cotton fields.

    酒泉盆地将成为我国新棉区
    甘肃省河西走廊酒泉盆地可以发展成为我国新的棉区之一。一九五四年，中央西北垦荒植棉调查组和甘肃省国营农场勘测队在这块盆地进行了初步调查，据估计，这块盆地宜于耕种的荒地面积有二百五十万亩到三百万亩。将来开垦后大部分可以种植棉花。甘肃省有关机关已根据调查结果提出了将来在这块盆地垦荒植棉的意见。
    酒泉盆地是以酒泉为中心，一直到敦煌的一片平坦的荒地，有黑河、疏勒河和党河等河流注其间。盆地全年的日光充足，气温、土壤等都宜于植棉。当地农民历年来就有零星种植棉花的习惯，去年农民种植的棉花，在品种和栽培技术没有经过普遍改良的情况下，每亩平均产皮棉四十斤，其中敦煌县每亩平均产皮棉近六十斤。将来黑河等各河流上游兴修大型水库和灌溉渠道，解决植棉用水问题以后，大片的荒地都可以成为产量很高的棉田。
