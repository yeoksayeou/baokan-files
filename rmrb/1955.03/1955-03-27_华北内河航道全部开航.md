North China Inland Waterways Fully Open to Navigation

Xinhua News Agency

    The over 3,000-kilometer-long waterways of North China's inland rivers are now fully open to navigation. Over four thousand sailboats and motor vessels shuttle between Tianjin and Linqing, Xinxiang, Handan, Baoding, Jixian, Tanggu, and other places. Navigation on various rivers is busy, with over 1,000 tons of goods shipped out of Tianjin daily.
    At several inland river docks in Tianjin, such as the Xihe Bridge and Jiefang Bridge, hundreds of ships load and unload cargo every day. Boatmen transport wheat, beans, cottonseed, reeds, and other grains and various industrial raw materials for the consumption of the city's residents. Over 3,000 tons of mats, which Tianjin needs in large quantities, have been transported from the Baiyangdian area. After unloading these goods, several thousand dockworkers are busy loading coal, salt, bean cake, fertilizer, agricultural implements, and daily necessities into the cargo holds, and then transporting them to the vast rural areas of North China via the Ziya River, Daqing River, South Grand Canal, and Ji Canal.

    华北内河航道全部开航
    华北内河三千多公里长的航道现已全部开航。四千多艘帆船和机轮，穿梭往来于天津和临清、新乡、邯郸、保定、蓟县、塘沽等地之间。各河航运繁忙，每日从天津运出的货物就有一千多吨。
    在天津的西河桥、解放桥等几个内河码头，每天都有数百只船在这里装卸货物。船工们从各地运来了小麦、豆子、棉籽、芦苇等供城市人民食用的粮食和各种工业原料。天津大量需要的席子，已从白洋淀地区运到三千多吨。几千名搬运装卸工人把这些货物卸下以后，又紧张地把煤炭、食盐、豆饼、肥料、农具和日用百货等装上货舱，然后通过子牙河、大清河、南运河、蓟运河等河流运往华北的广大农村。
