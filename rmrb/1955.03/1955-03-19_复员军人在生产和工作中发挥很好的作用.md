Xinhua News Agency reports: Demobilized construction soldiers who have returned to Rehe Province have been properly resettled by the People's Government and have played a very good role in work and production. Over the past few years, more than 600 demobilized construction soldiers in Rehe Province have been selected as models in various positions. More than 3,300 people in the province have been elected as representatives to the people's congresses at the village, county, and provincial levels. Demobilized construction soldiers are actively engaged in work and production. Chen Wenru, a demobilized construction soldier, came to the Coal Industry Building Materials Company of Chaoyang County in 1953 and worked as a measurer. Because of his active research and improvement of the oil unloading method, he saved manpower and reduced losses, saving the country more than 17 million yuan (old currency) in three months. Among the demobilized construction soldiers who returned to Rehe Province in 1954, more than 60% participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. At present, more than 1,000 demobilized construction soldiers in the province serve as directors of agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 2,500 serve as leaders of mutual aid groups.

[Our newspaper reports] The People's Governments at all levels in the Longxi Special District of Fujian actively resettle demobilized soldiers. The vast majority of soldiers demobilized from the People's Liberation Army from October 1954 to February of this year have settled down and are engaged in production or work.

As soon as the demobilized soldiers arrived in their hometowns, local staff introduced them to the local situation and earnestly helped them settle down. After returning to their hometowns, these demobilized soldiers carried forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers, actively participated in production and local work, and were supported and respected by the masses. After the demobilized soldiers of Gaonan Township, Pinghe County, returned, they immediately joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations, used the production subsidies issued by the People's Government to purchase耕牛(oxen for ploughing), and actively engaged in production. Of the 72 demobilized soldiers in Nan靖(Jing) County, except for 4 who participated in government work, the rest participated in agricultural production. Among them, 20 have joined agricultural production cooperatives and 40 have joined mutual aid groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 18th: Demobilized construction soldiers in Hangchou Township, Yiwu County, Zhejiang, have played a backbone role in rural production and various tasks, and have been praised by the local people.

Demobilized construction soldiers have all participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and play an active role in these organizations. After the demobilized construction soldier Ye Zhihai returned to his hometown, he reorganized the collapsed mutual aid group and was elected as the group leader. This mutual aid group has been continuously expanded and has recently been built into an agricultural production cooperative, and he has been elected as the deputy director. After the demobilized construction soldier Chen Jingren returned, he participated in pottery production. He actively mobilized everyone to organize a pottery production cooperative and was elected as the director. He used the tenacious spirit of overcoming difficulties in the army to overcome difficulties in production. He worked hard from morning till night to study and quickly mastered the skills of managing production. Now everyone says he is a good director.

Demobilized construction soldiers have performed well in water conservancy construction, flood prevention, and drought resistance. Once, a flood occurred in Hangchou Township, and demobilized construction soldiers took the lead in going to the embankment to rescue in the rain in the middle of the night. In the drought resistance, they also helped others with waterwheels. Demobilized construction soldier Ye Yingbao also ran around day and night to mediate the historical water conservancy disputes between villages. Many farmers reflected: People who come back from the army are really selfless, not afraid of hardship, and always think of everyone's interests. Demobilized construction soldiers also introduced their experiences in the army at various meetings, which promoted the conscription and replenishment of soldiers in the township.

    复员军人在生产和工作中发挥很好的作用
    据新华社讯：回到热河省的复员建设军人得到了人民政府的妥善安置，在工作和生产中发挥了很好的作用。几年以来，热河省有六百多名复员建设军人在各个岗位上被选为模范。全省有三千三百多人被选为村、县和省的人民代表大会代表。复员建设军人们都积极进行工作和生产。复员建设军人陈文儒，一九五三年到朝阳县的煤业建筑器材公司担任计量员工作，因为积极钻研，改进了卸油法，节省了人力，减少了损失，三个月给国家节省一千七百多万元（旧币）。一九五四年回到热河省的复员建设军人中，百分之六十以上参加了互助合作组织。现在全省有一千多名复员建设军人担任农业生产合作社主任，两千五百多名担任互助组组长。
    【本报讯】　福建龙溪专区各级人民政府积极安置复员军人，从一九五四年十月到今年二月从人民解放军复员回来的一批军人，绝大部分都已安家和从事生产或参加工作。
    复员军人一到故乡，地方工作人员就向他们介绍了当地的情况，并认真帮助他们安家。这些复员军人回乡后都发扬了革命军人的光荣传统，积极参加生产和地方工作，受到群众的拥护和尊敬。平和县高南乡复员军人回来后，马上参加互助合作组织，把人民政府发给的生产补助金拿去购买耕牛，积极投入生产。南靖县七十二名复员军人除四人参加政府工作外，其余都参加了农业生产，其中已有二十人参加农业生产合作社，四十人参加互助组。
    据新华社杭州十八日电：浙江义乌县杭畴乡的复员建设军人在农村的生产和各项工作中发挥了骨干作用，受到当地人民的赞扬。
    复员建设军人们都参加了互助合作组织，并在这些组织中起积极作用。复员建设军人叶志海回乡后就把已垮台的互助组重新组织起来，自己被选为互助组长。这个互助组不断扩大，最近已建成为农业生产合作社，他又被选为副社长。复员建设军人陈镜仁回来后参加陶器生产，他积极动员大家组织陶器生产合作社，并被选为社长。他用在部队里克服困难的顽强精神来克服生产中的困难。他起早带晚地努力学习，很快就掌握了管理生产的本领，现在大家都说他是个好社长。
    复员建设军人在兴修水利、防洪、抗旱等斗争中，都表现得很好。有一次杭畴乡发生洪水，复员建设军人就在半夜里冒雨带头上堤抢险。在抗旱中他们又帮助别人车水。复员建设军人叶英保还日夜奔走，调解了村和村之间的历史性水利纠纷。很多农民反映：部队回来的人真是大公无私，不怕辛苦，处处都为大家的利益着想。复员建设军人们还在各种会议上介绍他们在部队里的情形，推动了乡里的征集补充兵员工作。
