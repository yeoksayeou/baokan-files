    Today's Dragon Beard Ditch
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Dingfang
    As the sun just rises above the horizon, the working people of Dragon Beard Ditch in Beijing are already busily working. On Jin Yu Chi (Goldfish Pond) Street, children wearing red scarves are heading to school with their schoolbags. A constant stream of bicycles travels along the street, heading towards factories and production cooperatives. Housewives, carrying their shopping baskets and oil bottles, are heading towards retail stores and cooperative distribution points.

    Almost all the people living in Dragon Beard Ditch have stable jobs, and more than 80% of the small handicraft workers have joined handicraft production cooperatives. Liu Liansui works in the Beijing No. 1 Black and White Iron Supply and Sales Production Cooperative, making 1,000 iron dustpans each month, with a wage income of nearly 700,000 yuan (old currency). Her eldest son is already in elementary school. She is planning to buy several yards of fabric to make some spring clothes for herself and her two sons. Li Yufeng, a railway loader living on Jin Yu Chi Street, used to receive wages in the past that could buy forty catties of mixed flour in the evening, but by the next morning, it would only buy twenty-five catties. He often went to work on an empty stomach, often vomiting clear water from hunger during loading and unloading. Now, his family has added two more children, and they are living well. This Spring Festival, his wife made floral cotton-padded coats and lined jackets. They also have more than 500,000 yuan (old currency) in savings at the bank. He is studying in the sixth grade at the railway spare-time school. At railway workers' entertainment evenings, he can often be seen performing cross-talk and clapper talk with great enthusiasm.

    In the past five years, the more than 2,000 working-class households in Dragon Beard Ditch have acquired many new shirts, cotton-padded clothes, and bedding. They often eat white flour and meat, and many houses have been newly whitewashed. More than 1,000 school-age children are already attending the three elementary schools nearby. More than 500 households have savings in the People's Bank, with total deposits reaching more than 400 million yuan (old currency).

    今日的龙须沟
    新华社记者　周定舫
    太阳刚从地平线升起，北京龙须沟劳动人民已在紧张地忙碌着。金鱼池大街上，系着红领巾的孩子们背着书包，走向学校。自行车络绎不断地驶过大街，奔向工厂和生产合作社。家庭主妇们携着菜篮、油瓶走向零售商店和合作社分销处。
    住在龙须沟的人们差不多都有了固定的工作，百分之八十以上的小手工业者都已经参加了手工业生产合作社。刘连绥在北京市第一黑白铁供销生产合作社里工作，每月能做一千个铁簸箕，工资收入将近旧币七十万元。她的大儿子已经在小学念书。她正在计划买几丈布料，给自己和两个儿子做几件春装。住在金鱼池大街的铁路装卸工李玉峰，在解放前，晚上领到的工资能买四十斤混合面，到第二天清晨只能买二十五斤。他往往空着肚子去上班，在装卸时常常饿得吐清水。现在，他家里已经添了两个孩子，生活还过得很好。今年春节，他的妻子做了花的棉袄和夹袄。他们在银行还有了五十多万元（旧币）存款。他自己在铁路业余学校六年级读书。在铁路工人的文娱晚会上，时常可以看到他兴高采烈地表演相声和快板。
    龙须沟两千多户劳动人民五年来添置了不少新的单衣、棉衣和被褥，他们经常吃到白面和肉食，很多房屋都已粉刷一新。一千多个学龄儿童已经在附近的三所小学里上学。在人民银行储蓄的已有五百多户，存款数字达旧币四亿多元。
