    Be Aware of "Black Shops" with Red Signboards
    --Guard Against Rich Peasants and Counter-Revolutionary Elements Manipulating Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Yang Ye
    The leadership of agricultural production cooperatives must be firmly in the hands of the Communist Party and the advanced elements in the countryside. Only in this way can agricultural production cooperatives become a socialist revolutionary force. If an agricultural production cooperative is seized by rich peasants or counter-revolutionary elements, it will become a capitalist or counter-revolutionary force.
    According to a letter from Comrade Wang Zhixiang, who previously worked in the Jinan Military District of Shanxi, he recently discovered such an "agricultural production cooperative" in Beiyongan Village, Linfen County: the "Director," Wang Hongen, used to be the "Village Self-Defense Regiment Leader" for Yan Xishan's troops, was a leader of the reactionary sect "Da Fu Dao," and had close ties with spy organizations in Linfen City during the Japanese occupation. In 1947, he assassinated Liu Suozi, a demobilized revolutionary soldier. He felt he could not escape the law after the liberation of Linfen City and surrendered himself. After being detained for more than a year, he was released. "Committee Member" Li Guozheng, used to be a plainclothes agent for Yan Xishan's troops before liberation, is the adopted son of a counter-revolutionary who was suppressed, and is also a rogue. "Committee Member" An Jiuhai is also a reactionary sect leader. "Committee Member" Diao Chengxin is a rogue who was removed from his position as militia captain for engaging in illicit relationships. Among the eighteen existing cooperative members, there are nine counter-revolutionary elements and rogues. After they seized the leadership of the cooperative, they did their best to exclude and attack the more upright cooperative members, deliberately lowering the price of their cattle, assigning them
  “voluntary labor,” depriving them of their labor remuneration, and monopolizing the grain supplied to the cooperative members. Li Guozheng also boasted to the masses: "Agricultural production cooperatives are advanced organizations in the countryside; since we lead the agricultural cooperative, we can also lead the village cadres and all the work in the village!" Cooperative members are only allowed to follow the intentions of these bad elements; whoever violates their intentions will be subject to their oppression and attacks. Their occupation of the leadership position of this cooperative has seriously undermined the local agricultural cooperation movement; seeing that the cooperative is controlled by this gang of bad people, no one who has not joined the cooperative wants to join, and the masses have many misunderstandings and illusions about the agricultural cooperation movement.
    Why did such an "agricultural production cooperative" emerge? It turns out that in the autumn of 1954, the Linfen County Committee issued a large number of instructions to develop agricultural production cooperatives; the village branch secretary, Gao Facheng, wanted to achieve "every village has a cooperative" all at once, but the mutual aid foundation in Beiyongan Village was very poor, and there were no party members. What to do? He first summoned the village cadres, scolded them, and asked them to "fill out forms" to join the cooperative; then he convened a meeting of people who had joined secret societies, threatening them to join the cooperative; then he convened a mass meeting, saying: "If you want your livestock to have feed, you must join the cooperative; if you don't join the cooperative, you won't be able to buy grain for people to eat." That gang of bad elements saw an opportunity and sneaked into the cooperative. This cooperative was thus reluctantly "established" in September 1954; and the County Committee actually approved it. Because many bad elements joined the cooperative, some of those who had reluctantly signed up to join now firmly wanted to withdraw; some village cadres demanded the cleansing of bad elements. Gao Facheng said: "You are good, you don't want to join the cooperative, and when you join you want to withdraw! Others are not good, they have done bad things, but now they are more active than you!" The withdrawal of village cadres and honest farmers angered Gao Facheng. He felt that Wang Hongen, Li Guozheng and others were "capable," and that only by relying on them could the cooperative in this village be established and could "every village have a cooperative." Wang Hongen, Li Guozheng and others saw Gao Facheng's attitude and felt that there was an opportunity to exploit, so they pretended to be "active" and "supported" Gao Facheng, often running to Gao Facheng's home to "suck up" to him. In this way, Gao Facheng felt that Wang Hongen and others were even more "reliable"; he even allowed Li Guozheng to be trained in the county and serve as an accountant. He said: "Although Li Guozheng's family background and personal history are not good, he is the most educated and capable of doing this in the village." He also believed that Wang Hongen was a new middle peasant, and Li Guozheng and others were old middle peasants, not landlords or rich peasants; although there were problems in their history, it was good that they were now active in running the cooperative. He simply looked at the class composition of these people, and even ignored their past counter-revolutionary crimes.
    Is such an "agricultural production cooperative" a socialist fortress or a counter-revolutionary den? Isn't it clear!
    According to a letter from Comrade Gao Heng of the Rehe "Masses Daily" newspaper, he recently conducted an investigation in Yuanmaolong Village, Chifeng County, and found that there was an agricultural production cooperative in this village that was manipulated by rich peasants. This village is a key village directly led by the Chifeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the number of peasant households participating in the cooperative is nearly 70% of the total number of peasant households. However, judging from the situation in Yuanmaolong Natural Village, the main village of this administrative village, it cannot be said that socialism has taken the upper hand. The "Hongguang" agricultural production cooperative in this village is controlled by rich peasants. Among the thirteen management committee members of this cooperative, there are three new rich peasants, one old rich peasant, two old middle peasants, three new middle peasants, and four poor peasants. The director of the cooperative, Li Yu, and the deputy director, Yu Wenlong, are both poor peasants, and they are also upright and honest; however, they are just placed in the position of "director" as a formality. The real power in the cooperative is in the hands of a few new rich peasants headed by another deputy director, Zhang Fu. Zhang Fu and others never participate in the main labor in the cooperative, only "command" people, and occasionally doing odd jobs is also recorded as work points. When assessing land yields, Zhang Fu's land yield was actually more than 14,000 catties, but under the manipulation of their gang, it was assessed as more than 20,000 catties. When the autumn harvest in the cooperative was in full swing, Zhang Fu pulled more than 30 people from the cooperative to build a house for him. This gang of people also often spread rumors that "not much dividends will be distributed in the cooperative" to dampen the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members. Zhang Fu also pulled an old rich peasant into the cooperative as an accountant; this "accountant" did not keep accounts for a long time. The cooperative suffered from disaster and reduced production, and the working group of the county committee suggested that they lower some land rent so that those with more labor would not suffer too much. They said: "We are implementing a fixed rent system, and we said so in advance!" They rejected this reasonable suggestion. The result of the distribution: the investment interest of carts, horses and farm implements accounted for 5.5%; land dividends accounted for 30%; labor dividends only accounted for 22.8%. This clearly violated the principle that labor remuneration should be higher than the remuneration of means of production.
    From the perspective of the personal income of the cooperative members of this cooperative, they can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is the rich middle peasants with more land and large investments and the new rich peasants who have mixed into the cooperative. Although the yield in 1954 was only 70% of the normal year, their income still exceeded that in 1953. Zhang Bingyuan's net income in 1953 was 20,700 catties of grain, while his net income in the cooperative in 1954 was 23,614 catties; of which labor income accounted for only 20%, land income accounted for 52%, and investment interest accounted for 28%. The second category is the general middle peasants and new middle peasants, most of whom have income equal to or close to that in 1953. The third category is the poor peasants with less land and less investment, most of whom have reduced income. Wu Jingye has a family of six and no land. In 1954, he worked 206 labor days in the cooperative and earned 2,221 catties of raw grain. In 1953, when the cooperative was not established, he earned 3,400 catties of grain by farming for others, and 1,200 catties by raising cattle in winter. His income in the cooperative was 2,379 catties less than before joining. Zuo Zhifeng, with two laborers, worked 328 labor days and earned 4,050 catties of grain, which was 1,265 catties less than his annual income when he did not join the cooperative. They reflected: "This year, we worked hard for a year, and it is not as much as earning money by carrying goods!" "This year, we are working long hours for households with a lot of land!" In this way, although the cooperative was established, it was still "the poor get poorer."
    Why did such an "agricultural production cooperative" emerge? From the perspective of the village branch, the branch committee believed that these rich peasant households were "strong and well-managed" and regarded them as the "backbone force" for running the cooperative, believing that "it would be difficult to run without them." The comrades sent by the county committee also "rectified" this cooperative in the spring of 1954. However, they only thought that the labor organization and labor calculation were unreasonable, so they just helped to adjust the labor organization and corrected the tendency of a few people not working and earning points and earning more points for less work, but they did not analyze the problems of this cooperative from a class perspective.
    Is such a cooperative a socialist position or a capitalist paradise? Anyone can see it clearly.
    In old novels, we can see terrible stories about "black shops": some hotels with the sign "accommodating merchants" are actually engaged in murder and robbery. The signboard is one thing, but what they do is another. Can we allow such "black shops" to exist in our new society?
    "Collective farms and Soviets are only organizational forms, which are of course socialist organizational forms, but after all, they are organizational forms. Everything depends on what content is contained in this form." "The organizational form of collective farms, like the Soviets, is a weapon, and only a weapon. Under certain conditions, this weapon can be used to oppose the revolution. It can serve the workers and peasants. Under certain conditions, it can serve the enemies of the workers and peasants. The whole question is who holds this weapon and who is this weapon being used against." These are the words Stalin said twenty-two years ago. How useful these words are to us even today!

    留心挂红招牌的“黑店”
    ——谨防富农和反革命分子操纵农业生产合作社
    杨叶
    农业生产合作社的领导权必须掌握在共产党和农村中的先进分子的手里，因为只有这样，农业生产合作社才能成为社会主义的革命的力量；如果一个农业生产合作社被富农或反革命分子夺取了领导权，它也会成为资本主义或反革命的力量。
    据原在山西晋南军分区工作的王致祥同志来信说，他不久以前在临汾县北永安村发现了这样一个“农业生产合作社”：“主任”王洪恩，过去当过阎匪的“村自卫团长”，是反动道门“大福道”的一个头子，在日寇占领期间和临汾城里的特务组织有密切的联系，一九四七年曾暗杀了退伍革命军人刘锁子。他是在临汾城解放后感到难逃法网而自己投案，被扣押了一年多以后放回来的。“委员”李国正，在解放前当过阎匪便衣队员，是被镇压的反革命分子的过继儿子，并且是个流氓。“委员”安九海也是反动道首。“委员”刁成新是因为乱搞男女关系被解除民兵队长职务的流氓。现有的十八户社员当中，反革命分子和流氓分子就有九户。他们掌握了社的领导权以后，就竭力排斥和打击社内比较正派的社员，故意压低他们的牛价，派他们出
  “义务工”，剥夺他们的劳动报酬，垄断供应给社员的粮食。李国正还向群众吹嘘说：“农业生产合作社是农村的先进组织；我们领导了农业社，还能领导村干部和村里的一切工作哩！”社员们只许顺着这些坏分子的意图走；谁违背他们的意图，谁就要受到他们的压迫和打击。他们霸占了这个社的领导地位，就严重地破坏了当地的农业合作化运动；看到合作社被这帮子坏人掌握着，没入社的人谁也不愿入社了，群众对于农业合作化运动发生了很多误解和错觉。
    为什么会出现这么一个“农业生产合作社”呢？原来是这样的：临汾县委在一九五四年秋天发出了大量发展农业生产合作社的指示；乡支部书记高法成想一下子做到“村村有社”，可是北永安村的互助基础很不好，也没有党员。怎么办呢？他先召集村干部，训斥了他们一通，要他们“填表”入社；然后召集入过会道门的人开会，威胁他们入社；然后又召开群众大会，说：“你们想要让牲口吃到料，就要入社；如果不入社，人吃的粮食也买不到。”那一帮坏分子看到有机可乘，就钻到社里了。这个社就这样在一九五四年九月间勉强“建立”了起来；而县委也居然批准了它。因为不少坏分子入了社，原来勉强报名入社的人就有一些坚决要退出；有的村干部要求清洗坏分子。高法成却说：“你们好，不愿入社，入社又要退！人家不好，做过坏事，可是现在比你们还积极哩！”村干部和老实农民的退社，触怒了高法成。他觉得：还是王洪恩、李国正这帮子人“能干”，只有依靠他们才能把这个村的社办起来，才能“村村有社”。王洪恩、李国正等一帮子人看到高法成的态度，更觉得有空子可钻了，就越发装出一付“积极”样子，给高法成“捧场”，有事没事常跑到高法成家里去“巴结”。这样一来，高法成更觉得王洪恩等人“可靠”了；还让李国正去县里受训，担任会计职务。他说：“李国正虽然家庭出身和本人历史不好，可是村里数他有文化、能干这个事了。”他还认为：王洪恩是新中农，李国正等是老中农，都不是地主富农；历史上虽然有问题，可是现在对办社积极就好。他单纯看这些人的阶级成份，竟然连他们过去的反革命罪恶也不顾了。
    这样的“农业生产合作社”，是社会主义的堡垒呢，还是反革命的巢穴，还不清楚吗！
    又据热河“群众日报”社高恒同志来信说，他不久以前到赤峰县元茂隆村作了一次调查，发现这个村有一个农业生产合作社，是富农操纵着的。这个村是中共赤峰县委直接领导的一个重点村，参加合作社的农户将近农户总数的百分之七十。但是，从这个行政村的主要村庄元茂隆自然村的情形看，却不能说社会主义已经占了优势。这个村的“红光”农业生产合作社，被富农把持着领导权。这个社的十三个管理委员，其中有新富农三人，旧富农一人，老中农二人，新中农三人，贫农四人。社主任李玉和副主任于文龙都是贫农，为人也正派老实；但是，他们不过是被放在“主任”的位置上做样子的。社里的大权，掌握在另一个副主任张福为首的几户新富农手里。张福等人在社里从来不参加主要劳动，只管“指挥”人，偶然干点零活也记分。在评定土地产量时，张福的土地产量实际上是一万四千多斤，在他们一伙操纵下却评成了两万多斤。社里秋收正紧张的时候，张福却从社里拉去三十多个人给他盖房子。他们这伙子人还时常散布“社里分不上多少红”的流言，打击社员们的劳动情绪。张福还把一个旧富农拉进社里当会计；这个“会计”却很长时间不记账。这个社受灾减产了，县委工作组建议他们降低一些土地租额，以免劳力多的人吃亏太多。他们却说：“我们实行的是死租制，有言在先！”拒绝了这个合理的建议。分配的结果：车马农具的投资利息占百分之五点五；土地分红占百分之三十；劳动力分红只占百分之二十二点八。这显然违背了劳动报酬应当高于生产资料报酬的原则。
    从这个社的社员个人收入来看，大体可分三类：第一类是土地多、投资大的富裕中农和混进社内的新富农，虽然在一九五四年仅七成年景的情况下，他们的收入，仍然都超过了一九五三年。张秉元一九五三年纯收入折粮二万零七百斤，而一九五四年在社里的纯收入是二万三千六百一十四斤；其中劳动收入仅占百分之二十，土地收入则占百分之五十二，投资利息占百分之二十八。第二类是一般的中农和新中农，大部分和一九五三年收入相等或接近于一九五三年。第三类是土地少、投资少的贫农，大多数减少了收入。吴景业六口人，没有地，一九五四年在社里做了二百零六个劳动日，收入原粮二千二百二十一斤。一九五三年，没有成立社时，他给别人种地收入三千四百斤，又放了一冬牛收入一千二百斤，入社比没入社前还少收入二千三百七十九斤。左志风，两个劳动力，做了三百二十八个劳动日，收入四千零五十斤粮食，比没有入社时一年的收入少一千二百六十五斤。他们反映：“今年苦干一年，还不如扛活挣的多呢！”“今年算给地多户扛长活啦！”就这样，虽然办了合作社，仍然是“穷的越穷”。
    为什么会出现这么一个“农业生产合作社”呢？从村支部来说，支委认为这些富农户“人强马壮，经营有方”，把他们看成了办社的“中坚力量”，认为“离了他们就不好办”。县委派来的同志在一九五四年春天也“整顿”过这个社。可是，他们只是认为劳动组织和劳动计算不合理，也就只是帮助调整了一下劳动组织，纠正了少数人不劳得分和少劳多得分的偏向，却没有按照阶级观点分析这个社的问题。
    这样的社，是社会主义的阵地呢，还是资本主义的乐园？也是谁都能看得清楚的。
    在旧小说里，我们可以看到关于“黑店”的可怕的故事：有些挂着“安寓客商”的招牌的旅店，却干着杀人劫货的勾当。招牌是一回事，干什么勾当却是另一回事。我们能让这样的“黑店”在我们的新社会里存在吗？
    “集体农庄和苏维埃不过是个组织形式，固然是社会主义的组织形式，但终究是个组织形式。一切都依这个形式包含有什么内容为转移。”“集体农庄这个组织形式，也如苏维埃一样，乃是一个武器，而且仅仅是一个武器。在某种条件下，这个武器是可以用来反对革命的。它能服务于工农。在某种条件下，它能服务于工农敌人。全部问题是在于这个武器究竟握在谁手中，这个武器究竟是被利用去反对谁。”这些是斯大林在二十二年前说的话。这些话，到今天对我们还是多么有用啊！
