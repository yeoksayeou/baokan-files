    The Nanwan Reservoir project has begun full-scale construction. The builders of the reservoir are confidently striving to ensure that the reservoir project can contain the floods of the Shi River, a tributary of the Huai River, during this year's flood season.
    The Nanwan Reservoir's dam is a large earthen dam, 33.5 meters high and 721 meters long, built of earth, sand, and stone. To build this dam well, nearly one million cubic meters of clay are needed. The moisture content of this clay needs to be controlled to about 17.5 percent. If the moisture content is too high, the clay in the dam may crack and subside after consolidation, affecting the safety of the dam. The moisture content of the soil in the rice paddies near Nanwan is 27 to 30 percent, and the builders of the reservoir first encountered the difficulty of obtaining soil. They used the advanced Soviet air-drying method to reduce the moisture content of the soil. Like drying grain, the soil was dug out and exposed to wind and sun, and then made into huge soil stockpiles for storage, to be used for filling the dam. In this way, through the hard work of tens of thousands of migrant workers, eighty hill-like soil stockpiles were accumulated on the construction site. However, the more than 400,000 cubic meters of soil stored in all the stockpiles are only enough to fill the dam's foundation. The construction of the dam body requires more than 10,000 cubic meters of soil to be delivered to the dam every day. In order to solve the difficulty of soil supply, in addition to continuing to dry the locally sourced soil, the technicians went to the surrounding hills and valleys of the reservoir to find clay suitable for the project. They brought back various soil samples for repeated tests, and opened up new soil areas in accordance with engineering standards. The sand and stone materials needed for the dam construction project are also located five kilometers or even eighteen kilometers away. In order to strictly control engineering standards, the people building the reservoir built roads or laid light railways to transport materials.
    Building a dam is an arduous, meticulous, and complex project. To ensure that the dam can contain floods safely, it is also necessary to accurately control the compactness of the clay filled in the dam body. The soil layer rolled by the sheepsfoot roller makes each soil particle closely combined, eventually turning into an iron wall-like earth dam. The thickness, dryness, and compactness of each layer of soil are related to the safety of the entire dam body. During the construction process, the Nanwan Reservoir Headquarters required all employees to strictly control engineering standards. On the construction site, inspectors constantly took out compaction samples to carefully check the compaction standards. Youth League member Song Zhibin drove a "Stalin 80" tractor, and before each compaction, he would first grab a handful of soil to test the moisture content and estimate the number of compaction passes required. He mastered the rule that the soil along the edge of the dam was generally laid thicker, and pressed it two more times each time, avoiding re-compaction or missed compaction.
    The Nanwan area is a rainy region. According to the records of the Xinyang Hydrological Station from 1922 to 1948, there are more than twenty sunny days in March and October each year, while the remaining months have about fifteen rainy days, which greatly limits the construction time of the Nanwan Reservoir project. In rainy weather, the drying of soil and the dam filling project have to be suspended. In order to ensure that the reservoir project can contain floods during this year's flood season, the builders of the reservoir are trying to shorten the downtime due to rain as much as possible. When the weather is sunny, they use more dried soil; when the weather is cloudy or rainy, they use more sand instead of soil. Technician Yang Jiaying, in order to solve the problem of construction in rainy weather, after many studies, finally created a movable covering shed for rain protection, which is being trialled and adopted on the construction site together with other rain protection measures.

### 成长中的南湾水库

    成长中的南湾水库
    新华社记者　李人怡
    南湾水库工程开始全面施工了。水库的建设者们正满怀信心地争取水库工程在今年汛期内，能够拦蓄淮河支流溮河的洪水。
    南湾水库的拦河坝，是用土、沙和石料筑成的一座高三十三点五公尺、长七百二十一公尺的大土坝。要筑好这座拦河坝，共需粘土近一百万公方。这种粘土的含水量要求控制到百分之十七点五左右。如果含水量太大，拦河坝的粘土固结后可能裂缝和沉陷，影响坝身的安全。南湾附近稻田中土壤的含水量达百分之二十七到三十，水库的建设者首先碰到了取土的困难。他们采用苏联先进的空气干燥法来减少土料的含水量。像翻晒粮食一样，把土料挖出经过风吹日晒，然后作成巨大的土库封存起来，供给填筑拦河坝应用。就这样，经过数以万计的民工的辛勤劳动，工地上储备了八十个像丘陵一样的土库。但是所有土库储存的四十多万公方土料，只够填筑拦河坝的坝基。拦河坝坝身的施工，每天上坝的土料就需要一万多公方。为了解决土料供应的困难，民工们除了继续翻晒当地取来的土料以外，技术人员们便到水库周围的山岗上和山谷中去找寻适合工程需用的粘土。他们带回各种土样进行反复试验，在合乎工程标准的原则下去开辟新的土区。拦河坝建筑工程中所需的沙和石料也都在五公里甚至十八公里以外。为了严格掌握工程标准，建筑水库的人们修建起公路或铺设起轻便铁道来运料。
    建造拦河坝是一件艰巨而又细致、复杂的工程。要使拦河坝能拦蓄洪水又很安全，还要精确地掌握坝身所填粘土的紧密度。经过羊足滚碾压的土层，使每一颗土粒都紧密结合起来，最后变成一座铜墙铁壁似的土坝。每层土的厚薄、干湿和紧密度都关联到整个坝身的安全。施工过程中，南湾水库指挥部要求全体员工严格掌握工程标准。工地上，检验人员不断地取出碾压样品，仔细检验碾压标准。青年团员宋之彬驾驶着一部
  “斯大林八十号”拖拉机，每次碾压之前都先抓一把土料试看含水量多少，估算需要碾压的遍数。他掌握了土坝边沿一般铺土较厚的规律，每次都在这里多压两遍，避免了补压或漏压。
    南湾附近是个多雨地区。据信阳水文站一九二二年到一九四八年的记载，每年除了三月份和十月份有二十天以上的晴天外，其余各月都有十五天左右的雨天，这就使南湾水库工程的施工时间受到很大限制。遇到雨天，翻晒土料和土坝填筑工程都要被迫停工。水库的建筑者们为了使水库工程在今年汛期能拦蓄洪水，想办法尽量缩短因雨停工的时间。遇到晴天，他们就多用翻晒的土料；碰到阴雨天，他们就不上土而多上沙。技术员杨家英为了解决雨天施工的问题，经过多次研究，终于创造出一种用以防雨的活动覆盖棚架，这种棚架正和其他的防雨措施一齐在工地试行采用。
