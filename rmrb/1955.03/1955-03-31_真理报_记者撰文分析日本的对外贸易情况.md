Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: The "Pravda" newspaper published an article by its Tokyo correspondent, I. Prushevsky, analyzing Japan's foreign trade situation.

Prushevsky wrote: Not long ago, Japanese newspapers reported that Japan's foreign trade deficit in 1954 reached 769 million US dollars. The trade deficit with the United States was particularly large. In 1954, Japan's exports to the United States accounted for 17 percent of Japan's total exports, while imports from the United States reached 37 percent of Japan's total imports.

These facts explain why Japanese entrepreneurs, the Japanese public, and newspapers, who are more or less independent in their relations with the United States, insist that the government take measures to drastically reduce imports from the United States, or greatly increase exports to the United States and the general dollar area. However, years of experience have shown that the second path is almost closed to Japanese trade. Even attempts to expand exports to the sterling area are fraught with obstacles, such as tariff barriers.

The most practical way to put the Japanese economy on a sound footing, especially to increase exports, is to establish stable trade relations with new regions. As for these regions, there is no disagreement in Japan: it is necessary to establish business relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

Prushevsky went on to talk about how the decline in domestic purchasing power in Japan has made Japan even more dependent on foreign trade. He cited an example: We visited a tobacco factory in Japan employing 1,500 workers. The management told us that the average monthly salary of female workers was 8,000 yen, which was 50 percent lower than the official average salary. The wages in textile factories were similar. Even workers in heavy industry, such as a diesel engine factory we visited, did not receive more than 20,000 yen.

What is the purchasing power of this amount of salary? For example, a driver who earns 15,000 to 20,000 yen per month estimates his monthly expenses as follows: 9,000 yen for his own food, and the remaining approximately 10,000 yen to support his family of four. This amount is not enough to pay for the family's food and rent.

Therefore, at the current wage level, plans based on a large-scale expansion of domestic trade, even in consumer goods, are unrealistic, and Japanese capitalists openly admit this.

But that's not the whole story. Japan cannot obtain raw materials from domestic resources to supply its industry. Therefore, the price and freight of imported raw materials are extremely important. Japan imports many raw materials from regions that are so far away that the cost is three times as high. In addition, Japan pays for imported raw materials in US dollars instead of yen, which inevitably increases Japan's dependence on the United States.

All this once again proves that Japan urgently needs to trade with new regions, first and foremost with its closest neighbors.

### “真理报”记者撰文分析日本的对外贸易情况

    “真理报”记者撰文分析日本的对外贸易情况
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：“真理报”刊载了它在东京的记者伊·普利歇夫斯基的一篇文章，分析日本的对外贸易情况。
    普利歇夫斯基写道：不几天以前，日本报纸报道，日本在一九五四年的对外贸易赤字达七亿六千九百万美元。对美国的贸易逆差特别大。在一九五四年，日本对美国的出口占日本全部出口额的百分之十七，而从美国的进口却达到日本全部进口额的百分之三十七。
    这些事实说明，为什么在对美国的关系上或多或少有些独立的日本企业家、日本公众和报纸都坚持要求政府采取措施，以便能够急剧地削减从美国的进口，或大大增加对美国和一般美元区的出口。但是，多年的经验表明，第二条道路对日本贸易几乎是关死了的。甚至扩大对英镑区出口的尝试也是障碍重重，例如关税壁垒等等。
    把日本经济置于健全的基础上，特别是增加出口的最切实可行的办法，是同新的地区建立稳定的贸易关系。至于这些地区，在日本是没有意见分歧的：必须同中华人民共和国和苏联建立商务关系。
    普利歇夫斯基接着谈到日本国内购买力的低落使日本对对外贸易的依赖程度更加增加。他举例说：我们曾参观日本的一个雇有一千五百名职工的烟草工厂。资方对我们说，女工们每月的平均工资是八千日元，要比官方统计的平均工资低百分之五十。纺织厂内的工资也不相上下。即使重工业方面的工人，例如我们所参观的一个柴油发动机工厂，也得不到二万日元以上的工资。
    这个工资数目的购买力有多大呢？譬如说，一个司机每月拿一万五千到二万日元，他的每月开支估计如下：九千日元作为他本人的伙食，余下约一万日元供养他的家中四口。这个数目还不够付家中的伙食和房租。
    因此，在目前的工资水平下，以大量扩充国内贸易为基础的打算，即使在消费品方面扩充，也是不现实的，日本的资本家也公开承认这一点。
    但是，这还不是全部情况。日本不能从国内资源中取得原料供应它的工业。因此，进口原料的价格和运费便是极其重要的。日本有许多原料都是从远到使成本高达三倍的地区输入的。此外，日本用美元而不用日元支付进口原料，因而不可避免地增加日本对美国的依赖。
    这一切又一次证实：日本极其需要和新的地区、首先和它最近的邻国进行贸易。
