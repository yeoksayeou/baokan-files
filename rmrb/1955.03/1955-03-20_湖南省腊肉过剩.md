To the Editor:
	Currently, Hunan Province has a large backlog of preserved pork that cannot be disposed of.
	Not long ago, preserved pork was a popular item in Hunan, and was even sometimes out of stock. Around the Spring Festival, the situation suddenly changed: large quantities of preserved pork were shipped to Changsha. By February 14th, the city food company's inventory of preserved pork had exceeded 1.6 million jin (800,000 kg), enough to sell for more than three years based on Changsha's then current sales volume. However, despite the large stockpiles of preserved pork, the Provincial Food Company and the Provincial Native Produce Company continued to ship preserved pork in. When purchasing preserved pork, the Provincial Native Produce Company not only failed to contact the Food Company, but also refused to disclose the true figures. It is estimated that the total amount of preserved pork stockpiled in the province, including the inventory in Changsha and other areas within the province, is approximately 4.6 million jin (2,300,000 kg), worth nearly 3 million yuan. As the staff of the Food Company say, the current situation is one of "preserved pork surplus."
	After a commodity sells well, commercial departments blindly purchase large quantities, and even several units rush to purchase it, resulting in stockpiles. This situation has occurred more than once in the Hunan Province market. For example, last autumn, there was a shortage of lard in Changsha City, and the Food Company and the Native Produce Company competed to purchase it. By September and October, there were large stockpiles, and they had to be sold at reduced prices. Looking further back, similar problems occurred in the supply of bananas, persimmon cakes, and chestnuts in Changsha City in 1953. This "preserved pork surplus" is a more prominent event.
	The surplus of preserved pork has brought serious consequences. In terms of the loss of state property: if the preserved pork stored by the Food Company is sold quickly at the February price, it will already lose 40,000 yuan. With the addition of storage and sorting costs and losses during the promotion period, the loss figure will be even greater.
	The Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce should educate the Food Company to learn from this lesson and improve the supply of food.

### 湖南省腊肉过剩

    湖南省腊肉过剩编辑同志
    目前，湖南省积压了大量腊肉，没法处理。
    不久以前，腊肉在湖南还是一种俏货，有些时候甚至要脱销。春节前后，情况突然变了：大批腊肉运到了长沙，到二月十四日，市食品公司库存腊肉已经在一百六十万斤以上，按长沙当时全市销售量计算可以卖三年多。但是，尽管腊肉积压很多，省食品公司和省土产公司仍然把腊肉源源运来，省土产公司在采购腊肉时不但不和食品公司联系，而且不愿吐露真实数字。现在全省积压的腊肉，包括长沙库存和省内其它地区的存货，估计在四百六十万斤左右，价值近三百万元。用流传在食品公司工作人员中的话来说，目前的情况是：“腊肉过剩”了。
    在一种商品畅销以后，商业部门就盲目地大量进货，甚至几个单位抢着采购，结果造成积压。这种情况，在湖南省市场上出现已经不止一次了。例如，去年秋季长沙市猪油曾经脱销，食品公司和土产公司竞相进货，到九、十月间就大量积压，以后只得降价出售。再往远看，一九五三年在长沙市香蕉、柿饼、栗子的供应工作中也有过这样的问题。这次“腊肉过剩”更是一个比较突出的事件。
    腊肉的过剩带来了严重的恶果。拿国家财产所受损失来说：如果食品公司所存腊肉按二月份价格很快全部卖出，已经要亏本四万元，再加上推销期间的保管整理费用和损耗，损失数字就更大。
    湖南省商业厅应该教育食品公司接受这次教训，改进食品的供应。　童厚
