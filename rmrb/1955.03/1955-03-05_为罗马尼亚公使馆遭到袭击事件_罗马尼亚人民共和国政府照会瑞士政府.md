Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 3rd: The government of the Romanian People's Republic sent a note to the Swiss government on the 1st regarding the attack on the Romanian legation in Bern by bandits. This note is a response to the Swiss note of February 18th of this year.

In the note, the Romanian government expressed its surprise that the Swiss government disregarded the norms of international law and evaded its responsibility to ensure the diplomatic inviolability of the Romanian legation and its personnel. The note stated that the Swiss authorities did not take protective measures that could have prevented the attack on the Romanian legation.

The note pointed out that the Romanian government firmly insists that effective measures must be taken to prohibit individuals, terrorist bandits, and various organizations from engaging in activities against the Romanian People's Republic on Swiss territory.

The note stated that since the Swiss government claims that it cannot satisfy the Romanian government's request for the extradition of the criminals, the Romanian government reserves the right to raise this issue again in the future.

The Romanian government noted the Swiss government's statement that it would bring the attackers to court for trial and firmly insists that necessary measures should be taken to fully investigate this incident, identify all the masterminds, and expose all clues related to the organizers of the terrorist attack.

The note requests that the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Romanian People's Republic in Bern be allowed to represent the Romanian state as the injured party to appear in court during the trial of the defendants and during the testimony of witnesses, and requests that the Swiss government notify the Romanian government of the trial proceedings and investigation progress.

At the same time, the Romanian government demands that the Swiss government compensate the Romanian state for the losses suffered and provide compensation to the family of Secretary Aurila Setu.

    【新华社三日讯】　塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国政府一日就罗马尼亚驻伯尔尼公使馆遭到匪徒袭击一事照会瑞士政府。这个照会是对今年二月十八日的瑞士照会的答复。
    罗马尼亚政府在照会中表示对瑞士政府不顾国际公法的准则，回避它所应担负的保障罗马尼亚公使馆和它的人员外交上的不可侵犯的责任表示惊讶。照会说，瑞士当局没有采取能够阻止对罗马尼亚公使馆进行袭击的防护措施。
    照会指出，罗马尼亚政府坚决主张：必须采取有效措施，禁止个人、恐怖匪徒和各种组织在瑞士的领土上进行反对罗马尼亚人民共和国的活动。
    照会说，既然瑞士政府声称它不能满足罗马尼亚政府关于交出罪犯的要求，罗马尼亚政府保留以后再提出这个问题的权利。
    罗马尼亚政府注意到瑞士政府声称它将把袭击者交付法院审讯这一表示，并且坚决主张应采取必要措施，全面调查这个事件，查明所有的祸首和揭露同恐怖袭击组织者有关的一切线索。
    照会要求让罗马尼亚人民共和国驻伯尔尼临时代办代表罗马尼亚国家作为受害的一方在审讯被告时和在证人作供词时出庭，并且要求瑞士政府把审讯情形和调查情形通知罗马尼亚政府。
    同时，罗马尼亚政府要求瑞士政府赔偿罗马尼亚国家所遭到的损失，并且对秘书奥里拉·塞图的家庭给予赔偿。
