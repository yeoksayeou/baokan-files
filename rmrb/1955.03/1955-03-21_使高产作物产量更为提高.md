    Make High-Yield Crop Yields Even Higher
    The Southern Daily, on March 2nd, published the decision of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial People's Government on promoting moonflower grafting of sweet potatoes. Sweet potato is a major coarse grain in Guangdong and a high-yield crop. This year, the planting area in Guangdong province is approximately 13 million mu. Using the moonflower grafting method for large-scale production can increase the average yield of sweet potatoes by four to five times per mu, reaching around 5,000 jin, which is very beneficial for increasing grain production. The decision of the South China Sub-Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial People's Government requires that universal trials be conducted throughout the province this year, and that it be vigorously promoted in the future. To this end, the Southern Daily published an editorial on the same day, explaining the significance of promoting the moonflower grafting method from various aspects, and requiring Party committees and people's governments at all levels to conscientiously lead the work of promoting the moonflower grafting method. The Southern Daily also published an introductory article on "How to Graft Moonflowers and Sweet Potatoes" and a popular science article entitled "Why Can Hybridization Produce Good Seeds?"
    Striving to increase grain production by all means, planting high-yield crops, and further increasing the yield of high-yield crops are extremely important tasks for us at present. The Southern Daily has attached importance to the publicity of the moonflower grafting method, and it is very meaningful to use the newspaper to publicize and promote this yield-increasing technology for high-yield crops.

    使高产作物产量更为提高
    三月二日的南方日报，登出了中共中央华南分局和广东省人民委员会关于推广月光花嫁接番薯的决定。番薯是广东的主要杂粮，是一种高产作物。今年广东全省种植面积约有一千三百多万亩。采用月光花嫁接法进行较大面积的生产，可使每亩番薯平均产量增加四、五倍，达到五千斤左右，这对粮食增产有很大的好处。华南分局和广东省人民委员会的决定中要求，今年在全省范围内普遍试种，并在今后大力推行。为此，南方日报在当天发表的社论中，从各方面说明了推广月光花嫁接法的意义，要求各级党委和人民政府认真地领导推广月光花嫁接法的工作。南方日报还发表了“怎样进行月光花和番薯的嫁接”的介绍文章和“为什么杂交能长出好种？”的通俗科学专文。
    用一切方法争取粮食增产，播种高产作物，使高产作物产量更为提高，是我们当前的一个极为重要的任务。南方日报重视了月光花嫁接法的宣传，通过报纸来宣传和推广这种高产量作物的增产技术，这是十分有意义的。　（刘　林）
