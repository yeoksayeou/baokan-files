    Canteen, Ballroom, Cinema

    In June 1954, the Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau, due to an increase in personnel, found its original staff canteen to be crowded. The Shenyang Municipal Real Estate Administration decided to allocate 150 million yuan (old currency) and have its affiliated engineering company build them a simple canteen. After the design and budget were drawn up, the leading cadres of the Health Bureau suddenly suggested – “If the Real Estate Administration does the construction, it will cost an extra 30 million yuan (old currency) in management fees. Why don't we build it ourselves!" Who could refuse such a request to save state funds!

    After the Health Bureau received the construction funds, they discarded the original drawings and designed according to their own "hygiene principles." First, they expanded the kitchen: adding dormitory rooms for cooks, showers, changing rooms, and underground warehouses for storing frozen goods; strictly differentiating between washing pools for meat, fish, vegetables, rice; and separate cutting boards for noodles, vegetables, raw meat, and cooked meat; even the sliding doors for the serving room were automated. In this way, the canteen's area increased by more than 200 square meters compared to the original design.

    So far, the canteen's sanitary facilities were beyond reproach. The regret was that the bureau did not yet have a club. Taking this opportunity to carefully beautify the dining hall, making it suitable for eating, dancing, and showing movies, wouldn't that be killing several birds with one stone! In this way, they redesigned the dining hall.

    Now this "simple canteen" has become a magnificent club. Lofty steps support the solemn entrance. Pushing open the door, one's attention is immediately drawn to the newly painted sky-blue ceiling, from which hang various sparkling and dazzling chandeliers. The floor is smooth terrazzo. At the back of the hall is a balcony for projecting movies. Other doors, windows, folding chairs, and electrical broadcasting equipment are also exquisitely designed.

    Perhaps some people may wonder, how can 150 million yuan (old currency) do so much? Of course, it's not enough. For this, the leaders of the Health Bureau once mobilized employees to use their office hours for "voluntary labor," and repeatedly added to the budget. In reality, it has already used several "150 million yuan." Where did the money come from? They came up with it – extracting it from the surplus of the "Peace Bathhouse."

    The "Peace Bathhouse" is a public health enterprise affiliated with the Health Bureau. Public health funds should be used for public health facilities or turned over to the national treasury. Why did the leaders of the Health Bureau dare to spend it on a few employees of the Health Bureau (including the bureau chief himself)? Shakewei

    食堂、舞厅、电影院
    一九五四年六月间，沈阳市卫生局由于人员增加，原来的职工食堂显得拥挤，沈阳市房地产管理局决定拨款旧币一亿五千万元，由所属工程公司给他们盖一个简易食堂。当设计和预算做出来以后，卫生局的领导干部忽而提出建议——“由房地产管理局施工，得多花旧币三千万元管理费，不如让我们自己盖吧！”谁能拒绝这种节省国家资金的要求呢！
    卫生局拿到这批建筑款以后，就扔掉了原来的图样，按照自己的“卫生原则”来设计，首先是把厨房扩充一番：增设了炊事员宿舍、淋浴池、更衣室和储藏冷冻物品的地下仓库；严格区分了洗肉池、洗鱼池、洗菜池、洗米池、面案、切菜案、切生肉案、切熟肉案；连配膳室等的拉门也是自动化。这样，食堂的面积比原来设计增加了二百多平方公尺。
    至此，食堂的卫生设备是无可非议了。遗憾的是：局里还没有俱乐部，乘此机会把饭厅精心美化一番，使之吃饭、跳舞、映电影皆相宜，岂不一举数得！这样，他们又重新设计了饭厅。
    现在这座“简易食堂”已经变成华丽的俱乐部了。高高的台阶上烘托着庄严的大门。推门进去，引人注目的是油漆一新的天蓝色天花板，下悬各式晶莹耀眼的大吊灯。地面是光滑的水磨石。大厅后面有个映电影的吊楼。其他的门、窗、折叠式椅子和电气广播设备也都精工设计。
    也许有人会纳闷，怎么旧币一亿五千万元能办这许多事呢？当然不够。为了这，卫生局的领导人曾经动员职工占用办公时间来“义务劳动”，一次又一次地追加预算。实际上已用好几个“一亿五千万元”了。钱从哪里来呢？亏他们想得出——在“和平浴池”的结余中提取。
    “和平浴池”是卫生局所属的公共卫生事业。公共卫生事业费是应该用于公共卫生事业设施或上缴国库的，为什么卫生局的领导人竟敢把它花到卫生局几个职工（包括局长自己）的身上呢？　沙克伟
