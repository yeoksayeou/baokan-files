Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 16th. Wang Bingnan, the newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the People's Republic of Poland, accompanied by Attachés Yu Zhan, Wang Runsheng, Liu Ruoming, and Military Attaché Lin Fang, presented his credentials to Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State, on the afternoon of the 15th. Present at the ceremony were Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Skrzeszewski, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Naszkowski, Secretary of the Council of State Rybicki, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bartol, Acting Director of the Fifth Department Suchanski, and Deputy Director of the Office of the Council of State Suchentszewski.

    When Ambassador Wang Bingnan presented his credentials, he delivered a eulogy to Chairman Zawadzki, and Chairman Zawadzki delivered a response.

    Ambassador Wang Bingnan said in his eulogy: Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Bierut, and the government of the People's Republic of Poland, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Polish people have achieved brilliant successes in all aspects of socialist construction. Now, People's Poland has become a socialist industrial country with tremendous economic potential. The Polish people have made outstanding contributions to the struggle against the arming of West Germany, for the peaceful resolution of the German question, for the realization of European collective security, for the maintenance of peace in Korea and Indochina, for the easing of international tensions, and for the defense of world peace.

    The close cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples in political, economic, and cultural fields has increasingly consolidated and developed the friendship between our two peoples. The successive visits to Poland by our Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier Chen Yi, and the visit to our country by the Polish government delegation headed by Comrade Bierut, have further deepened the fraternal friendship between our two peoples. In the face of the current new international tensions, the Chinese and Polish peoples will surely unite more closely and further strengthen the world's forces of peace and democracy, led by the Soviet Union, in making greater contributions to the common struggle against war, for the defense of peace, and for the establishment of collective security.

    In his reply, Chairman Zawadzki said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the government of the People's Republic of China, and with the fraternal assistance of our common friend, the Soviet Union, the hard-working and selfless Chinese people have achieved truly admirable achievements in socialist construction, in developing the strength of the motherland, and in raising the living standards of the people.

    The People's Republic of China is a great and powerful people's democratic country, and an important factor influencing the development of the situation in Asia and the world. The growth of the People's Republic of China's strength and international prestige is a powerful pillar in the Asian people's struggle for freedom and independence, in the world peace camp's smashing of the imperialist aggressive bloc's war plans, in the struggle for the security of all nations, for the prohibition and destruction of weapons of mass destruction, and for the peaceful cooperation of all nations.

    The Polish people wholeheartedly congratulate the Chinese people on achieving further and greatest successes in developing the economy and culture of their beautiful and powerful country, and in the great and just task of fully liberating Taiwan and unifying the entire Chinese territory. I believe that the deepening of the sincere friendship and political, economic, and cultural cooperation between our peoples will make further valuable contributions to the development of the strength of our two countries and to the struggle for the world peace.
