    Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Baise Special District, the autonomous organs in the mountainous areas have gradually become nationalized. At present, a considerable number of outstanding members of minority nationalities and public leaders who have connections with the people of their own nationalities are participating in the work of people's governments at all levels, mass organizations, and financial and trade organs. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 6,000 cadres of Zhuang, Yao, Miao, and other minority nationalities in the eleven counties and one county-level autonomous region in the entire special district, including many county-level cadres. When performing their duties, the ethnic autonomous organs in the mountainous areas mostly use ethnic languages and try their best to take into account the characteristics and customs of the local ethnic groups. When the Joint Autonomous Region of All Ethnic Groups in Longlin County holds meetings, ethnic cadres use Miao and Zhuang languages to convey the policies of the Party and the government, and widely adopt mountain songs that are popular among the ethnic minorities when publicizing to the masses. In the past, the People's Government of this county did not have local minority ethnic judicial cadres, and the people would go to their own ethnic county magistrate to solve their problems. Since the judicial section transferred minority ethnic cadres and used multiple languages ​​such as Miao and Zhuang to carry out their work, the people also seek the judicial section to resolve their issues.

    桂西僮族自治区百色专区各自治机关逐步民族化
    广西桂西僮族自治区百色专区山区各自治机关已逐步民族化。现在，各级人民政府，各群众团体和财经、贸易机关都有相当数量的少数民族的优秀分子以及和本民族人民有联系的公众领袖参加工作。据不完全统计：全专区十一个县和一个县级自治区共有僮、瑶、苗等少数民族干部六千多人，其中有不少县级干部。山区各民族自治机关在执行职务时，大都使用民族语言并尽量照顾当地民族的特点及风俗习惯。隆林县各族联合自治区开会时，民族干部都用苗、僮族语言传达党和政府的政策，向群众宣传时，并广泛采用少数民族喜闻乐见的山歌形式。这个县的人民政府从前没有本地少数民族司法干部，人民有事情都去找他们本民族的县长解决，自从司法科调来了少数民族干部，又改用苗、僮等族多种语言进行工作后，人民有事情也找司法科来解决了。　（据新华社讯）
