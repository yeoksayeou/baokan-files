    Hurry and Rescue Grain from the Mouths of Insects
    An Gang
    After entering March, the insects in the granaries will soon lay eggs, pupate into moths, and then there will be several times or dozens of times more insects than before to eat the grain. If they are not treated and controlled early, irreparable serious losses will occur.
    It is estimated that in the entire Liaoning Province, the amount of stored wheat known to be infested with insects exceeds 70,000 tons. When the wheat was received in August 1954, insects were already found in the wheat. After receiving the wheat, comrades in the wheat-producing areas generally reported to the province: "The wheat has insects, which is very serious"; "The wheat is heating up, and some have grown green hair"; "The wheat already has a taste." However, these calls failed to alarm the people in the Provincial Grain Bureau responsible for storing and testing the grain. When the Haicheng County Grain Depot received the wheat, people grabbed a handful of wheat and rubbed it with their hands, and their hands were covered in water. Everyone was afraid to receive it. Later, the County Grain Bureau decided to receive it at a discounted price. By late October, the wheat stacks began to heat up, and the staff managing the granary repeatedly requested the Provincial Grain Bureau to help solve the problem, but no results were obtained. Later, they had to wait until winter to use the climate of minus 15 degrees to freeze the insects to death. Now there are still 20 to 100 insects per kilogram of wheat.
    In February of this year, someone wrote a letter to the editorial department of the Liaoning Daily to expose this situation. The editorial department of the Liaoning Daily forwarded the letter to the Provincial Grain Bureau for handling. But it has been a month and a half now, and no results have been seen. People have also reported this situation to the People's Daily correspondent stationed in Liaoning Province.
    According to the reporter's understanding, the insect infestation of wheat in Haicheng County Grain Depot is not the most serious compared to other counties. However, the wheat that has been infested by insects has been eaten to the point where only a shell remains. The color of these wheat grains is green, and they crumble into wheat bran when rubbed. Now the insects are about to reproduce, and if we do not take urgent action to vigorously rescue the wheat, there is a risk that all the wheat will be eaten. The grain in Haicheng Grain Depot has been frozen, and 80% of the insects have been frozen to death, but the situation is still so serious; now there are 69,000 tons of grain in the province that have not been frozen, and the wheat moths and larvae in the wheat have not been treated even once, and the severity of the insect infestation can be imagined.
    The Liaoning Provincial Grain Bureau knew about the insects in the granary a long time ago, so why didn't they take action to treat them in time?
    From August of last year to before the Liaoning Daily reader's exposure in February of this year, the main work done by the Grain Bureau was to issue a few instructions. They never sent a dedicated person to the Haicheng Grain Depot, which is only more than 100 kilometers away from Shenyang, to check the actual situation and let the insect infestation develop. Now, of the 5,722 tons of wheat in stock, 5,467 tons have been eaten by insects, of which 55,000 jin of wheat have been eaten by insects (including part of the loss before receipt). The Haicheng Grain Depot is responsible for this major accident. But they still tried to find ways to control the insect infestation. In addition to using freezing methods to eliminate insect pests, they wrote reports to the Grain Bureau, made many long-distance phone calls, and sent people directly to ask for instructions, but were perfunctorily dismissed by some bureaucrats. For example, the director of the grain depot once called the director of the storage department of the Grain Bureau to request assistance, and the reply was, "We will study it," and then there was no further news. When calling to inquire for the second time, a comrade from the storage section of the storage department answered the phone and replied: "Wait for me to discuss it with the director before telling you." You are also "studying," and he is also "studying," but there is no department or person who is really responsible for solving the problem. After the masses exposed the situation, the Supervision Office of the Grain Bureau sent people down to inspect on February 4th. They found that the Grain Bureau was responsible, so they returned to the Bureau to report. At this time, the Grain Bureau should have concentrated its efforts to rescue the wheat, but everyone shirked their responsibility. The comrades in the storage department said: "We have already issued instructions," and the comrades in the laboratory also said: "We have already issued notices" and "We have already formulated methods," as if everyone had fulfilled their responsibilities, and only those hateful insects were causing trouble. The Supervision Office sent people for a second inspection on February 23rd (note: this was already 20 days later!). They spent eight days to re-verify that the Grain Bureau should be responsible. The inspectors returned to sort out the materials, and because the matter involved the Grain Bureau, it was not until March 10th (note: another eight days!) that the first draft was sorted out.
    Let us draw a conclusion from this incident:
    Last year, the wheat in the granaries of Liaoning Province was infested with insects, and the Grain Bureau should have actively fought against the insect infestation and kept the wheat well. If the Grain Bureau had taken measures to control the wheat moth larvae in the wheat in actual action rather than in words or in writing since August of last year, and earnestly checked the eradication situation, it would have been possible to rescue a large amount of grain from the mouths of the insects. The Grain Bureau did not do this. Now, the grain has suffered a great loss. It should be said that the cause of the great loss of grain is not the insects, but serious bureaucracy. The structure of the Grain Bureau is very large. It has five divisions, three offices, and twenty-one sections, with a total of more than 300 staff members, but it cannot spare a person to go to Haicheng to see the actual situation and supervise the eradication of insect pests. The bureaucratic style has bound their hands and feet. They did not eliminate the insects in the wheat, but let the insects eat all the wheat. Now they have to use a net grain machine to blow away these eaten wheat. We demand that the Grain Bureau take emergency measures to quickly rescue the wheat that has not been eaten by insects. The most important thing at present is to buy time and eliminate the insects before they pupate into moths. Leading comrades should take the initiative to personally supervise the progress of the work, and not let the bureaucratic style of mutual evasion damage the entire work.
    Grain departments in various localities should learn from the lessons of the Liaoning Provincial Grain Bureau, conduct in-depth education on cherishing state and people's property and protecting grain for all personnel who store grain, and eliminate the attitude of indifference towards the phenomenon of grain damage. Grain workers should regard damaging a single grain of the country as their greatest shame, and fight against all waste and damage to grain.

    赶快从虫子嘴里抢救粮食
    安岗
    进入三月以后，粮仓内的虫子很快就要产卵、化蛾，接着就会出现比原来多几倍几十倍的虫子来吃粮食。如果不及早除治，就会发生不可挽救的严重损失。
    据估计全辽宁省保管的小麦已知道有虫子的就超过七万吨。当一九五四年八月接收麦子时，已经发现麦内有虫。产麦区的同志收到麦子后，曾经普遍向省反映：“小麦有虫，很严重”；“小麦发热，有的长了绿毛”；“小麦已经有味了”。可是这些呼声并没有能够惊动省粮食厅负责保管和化验粮食的人们。海城县粮库接收麦子时，人们抓起一把麦子，用手一搓就是一手水，大家不敢接收。后来由县粮食局决定折价接收才收下来。到了十月下旬，小麦囤开始发热，管理粮库的工作人员屡次请求省粮食厅帮助解决，没有得到任何结果。后来他们只好等到冬天，利用零下十五度的气候来冻死虫子。现在每公斤小麦还有二十到一百头虫子。
    今年二月有人写信给辽宁日报编辑部揭发了这个情况。辽宁日报编辑部把这封信转给省粮食厅处理。可是到现在已有一个半月了，还没有看到处理结果。人们又向人民日报驻辽宁省的记者反映了这个情况。
    根据记者了解，海城县粮库的小麦虫害比起别的县份来并不是最严重的。可是现在受到虫害的小麦，已经被吃得只剩一个外壳。这些麦子的颜色是青的，一搓就碎成麦麸子。现在虫子马上就要繁殖后代，如果再不紧急动手，大力抢救，全部麦子就有被吃光的危险。海城粮库的粮食曾经经过冷冻，虫子被冻死了百分之八十，情况尚且这样严重；现在全省还有六万九千吨粮食没有经过冷冻，小麦内的麦蛾、幼虫根本没有除治过一次，虫害严重程度可想而知。
    辽宁省粮食厅早就知道粮库内有虫子，为什么不及时动手除治呢？
    从去年八月到今年二月辽宁日报读者揭发以前，粮食厅作的工作主要是发了几个指示，他们从来没有派专人，到离沈阳只有一百多公里远的海城粮库去检查一下实际情况，一任虫害发展。现在库存五千七百二十二吨小麦中，已有五千四百六十七吨被虫蚀，其中有五万五千斤小麦已被虫子吃掉（包括在接收前损失的一部分）。海城粮库对这个重大事故，是要负责任的。但他们还是想了办法来除治虫害。他们除了采用冷冻的办法消灭虫害外，曾向粮食厅写了报告，打过多次长途电话，并直接派人去请示，但却被一些官僚主义者支吾搪塞过去。譬如，一次粮库主任曾给粮食厅仓储处处长打电话请求援助，得到的答复是，“我们研究研究”，以后就无下文。第二次打电话催问时，是仓储处所属保管科的一位同志接的电话，回答是：“等跟处长研究研究再告诉你”。你也是“研究”，他也是“研究”，就是没有一个部门，也没有一个人来真正负责解决这个问题。群众揭发后，粮食厅监察室二月四日派人下去检查，他们发现粮食厅是有责任的，于是就回厅作了汇报。这时，粮食厅首先应该集中力量抢救麦子了吧，可是大家反而推脱起责任来，仓储处同志说：“我们早已下了指示”，化验室同志也说：“我们早已下了通知”，“早已订出办法”，似乎大家都尽到了责任，只是那些可恶的虫子在作怪。监察室在二月二十三日（注意：这时已经过了二十天！）又派人作了第二次检查，他们花了八天时间，再次查明：粮食厅应当负责任。检查人员回来整理材料，由于事情牵涉到粮食厅，到了三月十日
  （注意：又过了八天！）才整理好初稿。
    让我们从这件事中，得出一条结论：
    去年辽宁省粮库内麦子生了虫，粮食厅就应当积极同虫害进行斗争，把麦子保管好。如果能够从去年八月起粮食厅不是在口头或文字上而是在实际行动中采取措施，设法除治麦子内麦蛾幼虫，并认真地检查根除情况，那就一定能够从虫子嘴里抢救出大批粮食。粮食厅没有这样作。现在，粮食受了很大的损失，应该说，造成粮食很大损失的原因不是虫子，而是严重的官僚主义。粮食厅的机构是很大的，它拥有五个处、三个室，二十一个科共三百多名工作人员，可是却不能分出一个人去海城看一看实际情况，并监督根除虫害工作。官僚主义的作风束缚了他们的手脚。他们没有把麦子中的虫子消灭，而是让虫子吃光了麦子，现在只好用净粮机把这些吃掉的小麦吹走。我们要求粮食厅采取紧急措施赶快抢救还没有被虫子吃掉的麦子。当前最重要的是要争取时间，把虫子在化蛾前消灭掉。领导同志应该亲自动手，直接督促工作的进行，而不要让文牍主义互相推诿的作风来损害整个工作。
    各地粮食部门要接受辽宁省粮食厅的教训，要对所有保管粮食的人员深入进行爱惜国家人民财产，保护粮食的教育，要消除对损坏粮食现象采取漠不关心的态度。粮食工作人员应当把损害国家一粒粮都看作是自己的最大的耻辱，要同一切浪费、损害粮食现象进行斗争。
