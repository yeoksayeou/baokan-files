    The Role of National Economic Planning in Socialist Construction
    Li Yuheng

    National economic planning, in its essence, is a method of managing the national economy. This method stems from the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Through this method, the various sectors and regions of the national economy, as well as the various components of the social expanded reproduction process—production, distribution, circulation, and consumption, accumulation—can develop harmoniously and proportionally. The method of national economic planning is not only necessary for managing the national economy in a socialist society, but also very necessary during the period of our country's transition from new democracy to socialism. The general task of our country during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. To gradually realize the country's general task, it is impossible to do without a plan.

    The development of industry cannot be carried out in isolation; it requires the cooperation and support of other sectors of the national economy. The socialist industrialization of the country first requires the support of the agricultural sector. The expanded reproduction of industry also requires agriculture to develop on the basis of expanded reproduction. To expand industry, it is first necessary to create certain market, raw material, and food preconditions for industry. Because to develop industry, it is necessary to increase the number of workers. With the rapid growth of the industrial population and the urban population, the agricultural sector is required to provide more food. At the same time, the rapid development of industry also requires the agricultural sector to provide sufficient raw materials—cotton, sugarcane, tobacco leaves, and oil crops, etc. For example, if we want to build a cotton textile factory with 100,000 spindles and 2,500 looms, it will need 400,000 dan of cotton a year, calculated on a three-shift production basis. To build a sugar factory with an annual output of 28,000 tons, the agricultural sector needs to produce more than 200,000 tons of sugarcane. If our agriculture cannot cooperate with the development of industry according to the requirements of the national plan and cannot provide or provide enough raw materials required by the growth of these industries, then the above-mentioned production plans of the textile industry and the sugar industry cannot be completed. In addition, under the specific conditions of our country at present, the agricultural sector is also required to provide a certain amount of export goods—native and special products—in exchange for the machinery and equipment necessary for socialist industrialization.

    The development of industry also requires the support of the transportation sector. Because if we want to implement socialist industrialization, we must carry out many industrial infrastructure constructions, which requires the transportation of a large number of machinery and equipment, building materials, and workers' living materials. At the same time, the raw materials consumed and the finished products produced in the industrial production process also need certain means of transportation to transport them. Therefore, if there is no corresponding transportation network between the various industrial bases, it is completely impossible to carry out industrial construction.

    The country's socialist industrialization also requires the support of the commercial sector. Because with the expansion of industrial production and the increase in the people's consumption needs, if there is no corresponding development of social commodity circulation, then there will be a phenomenon of industrial product backlog on the one hand and the people's needs not being met on the other hand. At the same time, under the current conditions in our country where multiple ownership systems coexist, the exchange of products between state-owned industry and private industry, between industry and other economic sectors, and between urban and rural areas is mainly through the form of commodity trade. And in this turnover process, the commercial sector is playing a role in promoting production. Commerce not only promotes the development of industry through the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, but also provides huge amounts of funds for the country's socialist industrialization through the form of commercial profit submission.

    Since the implementation of the country's socialist industrialization requires the corresponding development and coordination of other sectors of the national economy, it is necessary to stipulate certain proportional relationships between them through the national economic plan, to organize the balance between industry and agriculture, the balance between production and construction and national economic transportation, and the balance between production process and commodity circulation process. If these balances are not organized in planning work and correct proportional relationships are not stipulated between the various sectors of the national economy, it will inevitably reduce the speed of industrial development, thereby hindering the development of the country's socialist industrialization.

    From the perspective of the internal structure of industry, there are also interconnections and mutual constraints between the iron and steel industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, the fuel industry, the building materials industry, the chemical industry, and various light industries, and they affect each other with certain proportional relationships. This objective situation requires us to correctly stipulate the development ratio between various industrial sectors through the national economic plan, first of all, to correctly stipulate the development ratio between Category A industries (industries that produce means of production) and Category B industries (industries that produce consumer goods), because the nature of this development ratio determines the nature and speed of the entire industrialization.

    The central link in realizing the country's socialist industrialization is the development of heavy industry. Only by establishing heavy industry can the entire industry, transportation industry, and agriculture obtain the necessary material basis. Although the construction of heavy industry requires huge amounts of funds, a long period of time, and relatively complex technology, we must never abandon this policy and choose another policy. This is because: the development of social productive forces starts with the development of production tools, and heavy industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry, is the basic sector for manufacturing modern production tools. Only by first concentrating the main forces on the development of heavy industry can we guarantee our country's economic independence, guarantee the consolidation of national defense and national security, and guarantee the thorough improvement of the lives of all the people. On the contrary, if we place the focus of construction on other aspects, we will never be able to become an industrial country, and there will be no source of machinery and equipment needed by our light industry and agriculture. As a result, we will have neither heavy industry nor light industry; neither industry nor large-scale development of agriculture; neither the development of industry and agriculture nor the real improvement of the lives of workers and peasants. In that case, our country and people will be in a state of poverty for a long time, not to mention modern national defense. Of course, while we concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry, we must also develop light industry accordingly. Because with the development of heavy industry and infrastructure construction in other sectors of the national economy, as well as the development of agricultural production, the incomes of workers and peasants have increased, and their demand for light industrial products has also increased accordingly. Therefore, on the premise of ensuring that the growth rate of heavy industry is greater than the growth rate of light industry, the development speed of heavy industry should be adapted to the speed of the entire social expanded reproduction, and the development speed of light industry should be adapted to the speed of the increase in people's purchasing power. Without these two adaptations, the first and second categories in the entire social expanded reproduction process will be imbalanced.

    From the perspective of a specific industrial sector, the production of various enterprises must also be interconnected and balanced, and their production capacities should be proportionally coordinated. For example, within the iron and steel industry, the production capacity of iron smelting plants should be balanced with the production capacity of steel smelting plants, and the production capacity of steel smelting plants should be balanced with the production capacity of steel rolling plants. In the machinery manufacturing sector, reasonable cooperation between enterprises will greatly improve the utilization rate of production equipment and give full play to the potential capabilities of various enterprises. The balance and coordination of the production capacities of relevant enterprises in various departments can only be correctly resolved through the rational organization of the planning department.

    One of the basic problems in industrial construction is the issue of the regional allocation of productive forces. We should determine which regions should focus on developing which industries based on the economic conditions of each region. Stalin once pointed out: "First of all, it is about the correct distribution of industries throughout the Soviet Union. No matter how we develop the national economy, it is necessary to solve the problem of the correct distribution of industry, the leading sector of the national economy." The basic principles of rational allocation of socialist productive forces are: First, try to make the production site close to the source of raw materials and the place of consumption; Second, plan to distribute industries throughout the country to ensure the establishment of new industrial centers in the formerly backward agricultural areas and to bring industry and agriculture closer together; Third, according to the characteristics of the natural conditions of each region, implement a planned division of labor in each economic zone while comprehensively developing the economy within these regions, making it possible to utilize local raw materials as much as possible to meet the needs of the region for fuel, building materials, and daily-use light industrial products; Fourth, rapidly improve the economy of brotherly ethnic minority areas, which is the material basis for strengthening the friendly cooperation of all ethnic groups; Fifth, under the basic situation that capitalist encirclement still exists, the regional allocation of industrial productive forces should take into account the needs of national defense. It can be seen from this that the so-called problem of rational allocation of industrial productive forces is the problem of correctly stipulating regional proportional relationships, that is, the problem of regional investment allocation in the basic construction plan. Rationally solving this problem can save the accumulation of the national economy, expand the investment effect of basic construction, reduce the country's transportation expenditures, and fully utilize natural resources, thereby accelerating the process of socialist industrialization. The planning practice of the Soviet Union proves that the regional allocation plan of productive forces is one of the most important components of the national economic plan; without this plan, the country's industrial construction would be abstract.

    Large-scale industrial construction requires a sufficient number of human resources, material resources, and financial resources. The speed of socialist industrialization basically depends on the growth rate of these three. However, in the meantime, certain proportional relationships must be observed. If one aspect does not grow proportionally, the potential of the other two aspects cannot be fully utilized, and the speed of industrialization will be reduced. Conversely, if the three can grow proportionally, then the most reasonable and effective utilization can be obtained. The rational utilization of human resources, material resources, and financial resources is one of the main requirements of the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Therefore, we must, according to this requirement of the law of planned and proportionate development, correctly stipulate the growth ratio of the three through the compilation of the material balance sheet, labor balance sheet, and financial balance sheet in the national economic plan. On the basis of the most rational and effective utilization of human resources, material resources, and financial resources, we can ensure that our socialist industrialization is carried out at the highest speed.

    In summary, it can be seen that without the planning work of the national economy, the huge and complex cause of the country's socialist industrialization cannot be carried out smoothly.

    Not only must the country's socialist industrialization be carried out in a planned manner, but also the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce needs to be carried out in a planned manner. In this process, certain proportional relationships must also be grasped. Being too left or too right is not conducive to the development of production. The nature of this proportional relationship depends on the needs of the national economy and the degree of benefit or harm of various private economies to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Taking the current capitalist economy in our country as an example, it has both beneficial and positive effects and unfavorable and negative effects on the national economy and the people's livelihood. From a negative point of view, the relations of production of private capitalism have begun to hinder the development of productive forces, which is manifested in the low utilization rate and labor productivity of private enterprises, high costs, and low quality. Secondly, with the increasing development of the national economy, the contradictions between capitalist ownership and socialist ownership, the contradictions between the anarchy of capitalist production and the country's planned economic construction, and the contradictions between workers and capitalists in capitalist enterprises are also gradually developing. If this situation is not changed, this broad part of the social productive forces cannot be fully and rationally utilized to meet the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. But on the other hand, because our country's current economic situation is still very backward, and socialist industry and commerce cannot quickly replace all existing capitalist industry and commerce, it is necessary to make use of their enthusiasm as much as possible for a considerable period of time after the victory of the revolution in order to increase the supply of industrial products, increase the accumulation of the country's socialist industrialization funds, expand commodity circulation, maintain the employment of workers, and train technical workers and management personnel, so as to benefit the overall development of the national economy. Therefore, under the conditions of these two aspects of the role, our task is to separately stipulate a correct proportional relationship between socialist components and capitalist components according to the specific conditions of various sectors of the national economy (this proportional relationship changes in each period with the growth of the strength of the state-owned economy). This proportional relationship must be stipulated appropriately and must conform to the objective requirements of social and economic development. The socialist transformation of the individual economy (small peasant economy and individual handicrafts) must also be planned and guided. The speed of increase in agricultural products and handicraft products largely depends on the degree of transformation of their relations of production. We should make the two mutually adapted through the national economic plan. For example, recently, various places have put forward plans to increase the production of food and technical crops. The completion of these production increase plans must be guaranteed by a certain plan for the development of agricultural production cooperation. Therefore, in each planning year, we should start from analyzing the actual situation and determine a rough transformation progress according to the maturity of various conditions, and formulate a practical and feasible plan for the cooperation of the individual economy. Using this plan to guide the socialist transformation of the individual economy can prevent spontaneous conservative tendencies and rash advance tendencies. Conservative tendencies or rash advance tendencies in the process of socialist transformation of the individual economy will cause losses to production. To scientifically and correctly stipulate the progress of the socialist transformation of the individual economy, it is necessary to conduct economic activity analysis through planning work.

    It can be seen from this that it is unimaginable to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation without the method of national economic planning. Therefore, it is clearly stipulated in our country's constitution: "The state uses economic plans to guide the development and transformation of the national economy, so that productive forces are continuously improved, so as to improve the people's material life and cultural life, and consolidate the country's independence and security."

    According to Lenin, the national economic plan is the second party program. The party's policies and guidelines are specifically reflected in the national economic plan. The basic task of our country's first five-year plan is the concretization of the country's general task during the transition period. At present, the entire working people of our country are specifically fighting to build a socialist society through the first five-year construction plan.

    国民经济计划在社会主义建设中的作用
    李聿恒
    国民经济计划，按其本质来说，是管理国民经济的一种方法，这种方法是从国民经济有计划的按比例的发展法则中产生出来的。通过这种方法，可以使国民经济各部门、各地区以及社会扩大再生产过程各部分——生产、分配、流通、消费、积累——按比例地和谐地发展。国民经济计划这一种方法，不但在社会主义社会是管理国民经济所必需，就是在我国从新民主主义过渡到社会主义的时期也是十分需要的。我国在过渡时期的总任务，是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步完成国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。而要逐步实现国家的总任务，没有计划是不行的。
    发展工业是不可能孤立地进行的，它需要国民经济其他部门的配合与支援。国家的社会主义工业化首先需要农业部门的支援。工业的扩大再生产也要求农业在扩大再生产的基础上发展起来。扩展工业，首先必须给工业创造某些市场的、原料的和粮食的前提。因为要发展工业，就要增加工人。随着工业人口和城市人口的迅速增长，就要求农业部门提供更多的粮食。同时工业的迅速发展，还要求农业部门提供足够的原料——棉花、甘蔗、烟叶和油料作物等等。例如，我们要建立一个十万锭子和二千五百台布机的棉纺织厂；以每天三班生产计算，一年就需要四十万担棉花；建立一个年产两万八千吨的制糖厂，就需要农业部门多生产甘蔗二十几万吨。如果我们的农业不能根据国家计划的要求配合着工业的发展来发展，拿不出或拿不够这些工业增长所要求的原料来，那么上述纺织工业、制糖工业的生产计划就不可能完成。此外，在目前我国的具体条件下，还要求农业部门提供一定数量的出口物资——土、特产品，以换回进行社会主义工业化所必需的机器设备。
    发展工业同样需要运输部门的支援。因为我们要实行社会主义工业化，必须进行许多工业基本建设，这就有大量的机器设备、建筑材料和工人的生活资料需要运输。同时，在工业生产过程中所消耗的原材料和制出的成品，也需要一定的运输工具来运送。因此，如果在各工业基地之间，没有相应的交通运输网，要进行工业建设是完全不可能的。
    国家的社会主义工业化也需要商业部门的支援。因为工业生产的扩大，人民消费需要的提高，如果没有社会商品流转的相应发展，那末就会发生一方面工业产品积压，一方面人民需要得不到满足的现象。同时，在目前我国多种所有制并存的条件下，国营工业与私营工业、工业与其他经济部门、城市与乡村之间的产品交换，主要还是通过商品贸易的形式。而在这个周转过程中，商业部门正起着促进生产的作用。商业不仅仅是通过城乡物资交流来促进工业的发展，而且通过商业利润上缴的形式，还为国家的社会主义工业化提供巨额的资金。
    既然实行国家的社会主义工业化需要国民经济其他部门相应的发展与配合，就必须通过国民经济计划在它们之间规定一定的比例关系，组织工业与农业之间的平衡、生产建设与国民经济运输之间的平衡以及生产过程与商品流通过程之间的平衡。如果不在计划工作中组织这些平衡，不在国民经济各部门之间规定正确的比例关系，那末必然会降低工业发展的速度，从而使国家的社会主义工业化事业的发展受到阻碍。
    从工业内部来看，在钢铁工业、机器制造业、燃料工业、建筑器材工业、化学工业以及各种轻工业之间，亦是相互联系相互制约的，它们以一定的比例关系相互影响着。这种客观情况，要求我们通过国民经济计划正确地规定各工业部门之间的发展比例，首先是正确规定甲类工业（生产生产资料的工业）与乙类工业（生产消费资料的工业）之间的发展比例，因为这一发展比例的性质决定着整个工业化的性质与速度。
    实现国家的社会主义工业化的中心环节是发展重工业。只有建立了重工业，才能使全部工业、运输业以及农业获得所必需的物质基础。虽然建设重工业需要巨量资金、较长的时间和比较复杂的技术，但我们决不能舍弃这一个方针而选择另外的方针。这是因为：社会生产力的发展，首先是从生产工具的发展开始的，而重工业特别是其中的机器制造业，就是制造现代化生产工具的基本部门。只有首先集中主要力量发展重工业，才能保证我国在经济上的独立，才能保证国防的巩固和国家的安全，才能保证彻底地改善全体人民的生活。与此相反，如果将建设重点放在其它方面，我们就会始终不能成为一个工业国家，而我们的轻工业和农业所需要的机器装备也就没有来源，结果我们将既没有重工业，也没有轻工业；既没有工业，也就没有大规模发展的农业；既没有工农业的发展，也没有工人农民生活的真正改善。那样，我们的国家和人民都将长期陷于贫困的境地，更不用说现代化的国防了。当然，在我们集中主要力量发展重工业的同时，还要相应地发展轻工业。因为随着重工业和国民经济其他部门基本建设的开展以及农业生产的发展，工人和农民的收入都增加了，他们对轻工业品的需求也就随着增长起来。因此，在保证重工业增长速度大于轻工业增长速度的条件下，同时应使重工业的发展速度与整个社会扩大再生产的速度相适应，轻工业的发展速度与人民购买力的提高速度相适应。没有这二种适应，整个社会扩大再生产过程中的第一部类与第二部类就会发生不平衡现象。
    从一个具体的工业部门来看，各个企业的生产也必须相互衔接和平衡，它们的生产能力应该按比例地配合。例如在钢铁工业内部，炼铁厂的生产能力应与炼钢厂的生产能力相平衡，炼钢厂的生产能力又应与轧钢厂的生产能力相平衡。在机器制造部门，各企业的合理协作，将大大提高生产设备的利用率，发挥各企业的潜在能力。而各部门有关企业生产能力的平衡与协作，只有通过计划部门的合理组织，才能获得正确的解决。
    工业建设中基本问题之一是生产力的地区配置问题。我们应当根据各地区的经济条件，来确定哪些地区重点发展哪些工业。斯大林曾指出：“首先是关于苏联全国各处工业的正确分布问题。无论我们怎样发展国民经济，都是必须要把工业这一国民经济主导部门的正确分布问题解决才行。”社会主义生产力合理配置的基本原则是：第一、尽力使生产地接近原料产地和消费地；第二、有计划地把工业分布在全国各地，以保证在从前落后的农业地区建立起新的工业中心，使工业和农业接近起来；第三、根据各地区自然条件的特点，在各个经济区实行有计划的分工的同时，使这些地区内部的经济得到全面的发展，尽可能地利用本地原料，满足本地区对燃料、建筑材料和日用轻工业品的需要；第四、迅速提高兄弟民族地区的经济，这是加强各族人民友好合作的物质基础；第五、在资本主义包围的基本形势仍然存在的条件下，工业生产力的地区配置应考虑到国防上的需要。由此可见，所谓工业生产力合理配置的问题，就是正确规定地区比例关系的问题，也就是基本建设计划中地区投资分配的问题。合理地解决这一问题，就可以节约国民经济的积累，扩大基本建设的投资效果，减少国家的运输支出，充分地利用自然资源，从而加速社会主义工业化的进程。苏联的计划实践证明：生产力的地区配置计划乃是国民经济计划中最重要的组成部分之一；没有这个计划，国家的工业建设就会是抽象的。
    大规模的工业建设，要求具备足够数量的人力、物力、财力。而社会主义工业化的速度，基本上就取决于这三者的增长速度。但是，在这中间，必须遵守一定的比例关系，其中如有一方面不是按比例地增长，就会使其他两方面的潜力不能充分发挥，使工业化的速度降低。反过来说，如果三者能按比例地增长，那末就能得到最合理和最有效的利用。而人力、物力、财力的合理利用，是国民经济有计划按比例发展法则的主要要求之一。因此，我们必须根据有计划按比例发展法则的这一要求，通过国民经济计划中的物资平衡表、劳动平衡表和财政平衡表的编制，正确规定三者的增长比例。在最合理和最有效地利用人力、物力、财力的基础上，保证我们的社会主义工业化以最高速度来进行。
    综上所述，可见如果没有国民经济的计划工作，那末规模巨大、联系复杂的国家的社会主义工业化事业，是无法顺利进行的。
    不仅国家的社会主义工业化，必须有计划地进行，就是实现对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也需要有计划地进行。在这一过程中，也必须掌握一定的比例关系，过左或过右，对于发展生产都是不利的。这一比例关系的性质取决于国民经济的需要和各种私人经济对于国计民生的利害程度。以目前我国的资本主义经济而言，它对国计民生有着有利的积极作用与不利的消极作用两个方面。从消极方面来看，私人资本主义的生产关系已经开始阻碍着生产力的发展，这表现为私营企业设备利用率和劳动生产率的低下、成本高、质量低等等方面。其次，随着国民经济的日益发展，资本主义所有制和社会主义所有制之间的矛盾，资本主义生产的无政府状态和国家有计划的经济建设之间的矛盾，资本主义企业内的工人和资本家之间的矛盾，亦逐渐发展。如果不改变这种情况，这个广大部分的社会生产力就不可能获得充分的合理的利用，以适应国计民生的需要。但是在另一方面，由于我国目前经济状况还很落后，社会主义工商业还不能很快地代替现有的全部资本主义工商业，在革命胜利以后一个相当长的时期内还需要尽可能地利用它们的积极性，借以增加工业产品的供应，增加国家的社会主义工业化资金的积累，扩大商品流转，维持劳动者的就业，训练技术工人和管理人员，以利于国民经济的总体发展。因此，在这样两方面作用的条件下，我们的任务，就在于根据国民经济各部门的具体情况，分别规定社会主义成分与资本主义成分之间的一个正确比例关系（这一比例关系是随着国营经济实力的增长而每一时期不同的）。这一比例关系必须规定得适当，要合乎社会经济发展的客观要求。对于个体经济（小农经济和个体手工业）的社会主义改造，亦必须加以计划指导。农产品和手工业产品的增加速度，在很大程度上取决于它们生产关系的改造程度，我们应通过国民经济计划，使两方面相互适应。例如，最近各地都提出了粮食和技术作物的增产计划，这些增产计划的完成，都必须有一定的农业生产合作化发展计划为之保证。因此，在每一个计划年度，我们都应该从分析现实的情况出发，根据各方面条件的成熟程度，来确定一个大致的改造进度，制订出切实可行的个体经济合作化的计划。以这种计划来指导个体经济的社会主义改造，可以防止自发的保守倾向和冒进倾向。个体经济社会主义改造过程中的保守倾向或冒进倾向，都会使生产受到损失。而要科学地正确地规定个体经济社会主义改造的进度，又必须通过计划工作中的经济活动分析。
    由此可见，不通过国民经济计划这一种方法，而要进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，是不可想像的。因此，在我国宪法中已明确规定：“国家用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，使生产力不断提高，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全。”
    按照列宁的说法，国民经济计划乃是第二个党纲。党的政策方针具体表现在国民经济计划上。我国第一个五年计划的基本任务乃是国家在过渡时期总任务的具体化。目前，我国的全体劳动人民，正具体地通过第一个五年建设计划，为建设社会主义社会而斗争。
