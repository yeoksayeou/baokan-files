    Yunnan Builds and Renovates a Batch of Factories
    From 1954 to January of this year, seventeen newly built and renovated factories in various parts of Yunnan Province have been put into production. Among these factories are the Simao Farm Implement Processing Plant, Lijiang Farm Implement Processing Plant, Wenshan Farm Implement Factory, Mengzi Farm Implement Iron Factory, which produce agricultural implements, as well as coal mines, iron smelting plants, and sugar refineries.
    After the completion and commissioning of the farm implement factories in Lijiang, Simao, Wenshan, Mengzi, and other places, the supply of agricultural implements needed by nearby farmers has been basically guaranteed. In addition to producing a large number of hoes and other old-fashioned agricultural implements every month, the Lijiang Farm Implement Factory can also imitate new-style walking plows, rice threshers, corn threshers, and other new-style agricultural implements. The Simao Farm Implement Factory produced hundreds of agricultural implements in January of this year alone. After the newly built hot-blast furnace of the Mouding Iron Smelting Plant was put into production, the daily output of local iron in January of this year increased by six and a half times compared to the past. In the past, the Chengong Xiehe Coal Mine was restricted by transportation conditions, and about 45% of the coal could not be transported out. Since the newly built highway connected with the Kunming-Kaiyuan Railway, the coal produced by this coal mine has been able to be transported to Kunming and other places in a timely manner.

    云南新建和改建一批工厂
    从一九五四年到今年一月份，云南省各地已有十七个新建和改建的工厂投入生产。在这些工厂中，有生产农具的思茅农具加工厂、丽江农具加工厂、文山农具厂、蒙自农具铁工厂，和煤矿、炼铁厂、糖厂等。
    丽江、思茅、文山、蒙自等地的农具厂建成并投入生产以后，对附近农民所需要的农具已基本上保证了供应。丽江农具厂除每月可生产大量条锄及其它旧式农具外，并能仿制新式步犁、打稻机、包谷脱粒器等新式农具。思茅农具厂在今年一月份就生产了数百件农具。牟定炼铁厂新建的热风炼铁炉投入生产以后，今年一月份土铁的日产量，比过去提高了六倍半。呈贡协和煤矿过去因受运输条件限制，百分之四十五左右的煤都运不出来；自从新修的公路和昆明到开远的铁路相接后，这个煤矿所产的煤已能够及时运销昆明等地了。
