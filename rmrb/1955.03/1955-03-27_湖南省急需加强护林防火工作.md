To the Editor:

    Recently, I went to Hunan for some business and found that forest fires there were frequent, reaching an alarming level. From the thaw to the beginning of February, a total of 439 forest fires of varying sizes occurred throughout the province, burning down more than 370,000 mu of mountain forests (more than 5.48 million trees), which is equivalent to more than 18 percent of the province's planned afforestation area this year (2.08 million mu), and 8.2 percent more than the actual afforestation area at that time. From the winter of last year to the beginning of February this year, Yongshun County had a total of 479 forest fires, burning down more than 140,000 mu of mountain forests, more than 100 times larger than the local actual afforestation area this spring. In Linwu County, 21 forest fires occurred in the three days from February 27th to March 1st, burning down more than 10,000 mu of mountain forests. According to my understanding in the Third District of Chen County, this district alone had 66 forest fires from November last year to the end of February this year (57 in February), burning down more than 20,000 mu of mountain forests (more than 720,000 trees), which is approximately seven times the local afforestation area this spring. More than 70,000 mu of mountain forests were burned down in the Chen County Special District, resulting in losses of more than 3 million yuan. The losses caused by forest fires throughout the province will be even more staggering.

    This phenomenon of "planting little, burning much; planting small, burning large" not only greatly affects the development of the motherland's forest resources, but also seriously undermines the enthusiasm of farmers for planting trees and making forests.

    Why are forest fires in Hunan Province burning so fiercely? Most forest fires are caused by farmers carelessly burning wasteland and collecting fertilizer, and some are set by bad elements. The broad masses of farmers are extremely dissatisfied with the frequent forest fires, especially those farmers who own mountain forests and feel even more distressed by the fires. So, where exactly is the problem? The problem lies in the lack of due attention and effective leadership from leading organs at all levels regarding forest fire prevention work.

    At present, although each county in Hunan has a forest fire prevention headquarters, and most villages also have mass forest protection organizations, some headquarters exist only in name, and many village forest protection organizations are also reduced to mere formalities. The Forest Protection Committee and village forest protection groups in Tiezhashi Township, Chen County, have not held meetings for more than a year. Such organizations, of course, cannot effectively play a role in forest protection.

    Many district and township cadres do not have a deep understanding of the principle of "fire prevention is better than firefighting." After a fire occurs, they can generally mobilize the masses to rescue it, but they rarely pay attention to publicity and education work on forest fire prevention on weekdays, and after the fire is extinguished, they rarely check the causes, learn lessons, and take measures to prevent it. There are also many cadres who are accustomed to forest fires, and even do not go to rescue them when they see a fire. For example, in Pingtou Township, Sixth District of Zixing, a mountain fire burned for three days and three nights, but the district chief believed that the meeting was important and did not allow forestry cadres to rescue it; on January 17th, a mountain fire occurred in the Fourth District of Chaling, and the district cadres still did not go to rescue it after three urgent telephone notifications from the County Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy; Wanxianling in Huaishuxia Township, Third District of Chen County, burned continuously for four days, and the district committee member working in the township ignored it. This kind of disregard for the state's forest wealth is truly intolerable.

    It is now the season of spring plowing, and rural activities of burning wasteland and collecting fertilizer are increasing. In addition, the Qingming Festival for visiting graves is approaching. It is hoped that the Hunan Provincial People's Committee will promptly urge all localities to do a good job in forest protection, prevent the occurrence of forest fires, and ensure the normal progress of spring plowing and production.

    湖南省急需加强护林防火工作编辑同志：
    最近，我因事到湖南一次，发现当地山林火灾频繁，达到了惊人的程度。自从解冻到二月初，全省共发生大小山火四百三十九次，烧毁山林三十七万多亩（林木五百四十八万多株），等于今年全省计划造林面积（二百零八万亩）的百分之十八以上，比当时实际造林面积还多百分之八点二。永顺县从去年冬季到今年二月初共发生山火四百七十九次，烧毁山林十四万多亩，大于当地今春实际造林面积一百多倍。临武县从二月二十七日到三月一日的三天中就发生山火二十一次，烧毁山林一万多亩。据我在郴县三区了解，光这个区从去年十一月到今年二月底就发生山火六十六次（其中二月份五十七次），烧毁山林二万多亩（林木七十二万多株），约等于当地今春造林面积的七倍。郴县专区烧毁的山林有七万多亩，损失达三百万元以上，全省烧林所造成的损失将更加惊人。
    这种“种得少、烧得多，种了小的、烧了大的”的现象，不但大大影响祖国森林资源的发展，而且还严重地打击了农民植树造林的积极性。
    为什么湖南省的山火会烧得这样凶呢？山火的起因，大部分是农民烧垦荒地和积肥的时候不小心所引起的，也有一部分是坏分子放的火。广大农民对于山林失火频繁的情况是极度不满的，特别是自有山林的农民遭了火灾感到更加痛心。那么，究竟问题在那里呢？问题在于各级领导机关对护林防火工作缺乏应有的重视和切实的领导。
    目前湖南各县虽然都有护林防火指挥部，大多数乡村也有群众性护林组织，但有些指挥部只是虚有其名，很多乡村护林组织也多流于形式。郴县铁渣市乡护林委员会和村护林小组已经一年多不开会了，这样的组织，当然不能有效地发挥护林的作用。
    很多区乡干部对“防火胜于救火”的方针没有深刻的认识。他们在火灾发生后，一般都能带动群众去抢救，但平日对护林防火的宣传教育工作就很少注意，救完了火也很少检查原因，接受教训，来加以防止。也有不少干部对山火习以为常，甚至看到火灾也不去抢救。像资兴六区坪头乡山火烧了三天三夜，区长认为开会重要，不让林业干部去抢救；茶陵四区在一月十七日发生山火，区干部连接县农林水利局三次电话紧急通知，仍然不去抢救；郴县三区槐树下乡万仙岭连烧了四天，在该乡工作的区委委员置之不理。这种漠视国家森林财富的现象，实在不能容忍。
    目前已到春耕季节，农村烧垦荒地和积肥活动正多，加以清明上坟季节将到，希望湖南省人民委员会迅速督促各地做好护林工作，制止山火发生，保障春耕生产的正常进行。            鹿　林
