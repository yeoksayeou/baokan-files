Agricultural machinery and tractor stations in thirteen counties and cities in Heilongjiang Province, including Huachuan, Gucheng, Fujin, Suihua, and Hailun, are currently assisting collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives served by each station to prepare for spring plowing.

The Gucheng Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Station in Keshan sent personnel to the Heping (Peace), Gongchanzhuyi Dengta (Communism Lighthouse) collective farms and various agricultural production cooperatives to help formulate production plans and signed contracts for substitute plowing with a farm and some agricultural production cooperatives in Gucheng Township. The Baoshan Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Station in Suihua organized seventy-four employees to go deep into sixteen villages and sixty-seven agricultural production cooperatives to mobilize for spring plowing. They also helped many societies and teams of farmers study methods for increasing production, greatly promoting the spring plowing work within the station's service area. The area of fertilization originally accounted for 50% of the total area, but has now increased to 70%. The Guoxing Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Station in Hailun sent two working groups to Shuangquan, Minzhong and other villages to help conduct seed germination tests. The Nehe and other agricultural machinery and tractor stations also sent people to re-examine the quality of cultivated land in the agricultural production cooperatives. After discovering that there was little snow and the land was dry, they immediately invited experienced farmers to study and come up with the drought-resistant method of "collecting snow to loosen the land and compacting it while moist."

    农业机器站帮助农民备耕
    黑龙江省桦川、古城、富锦、绥化、海伦等十三个农业机器拖拉机站，目前正帮助各站所服务的集体农庄、农业生产合作社准备春耕。
    克山古城农业机器拖拉机站派人到和平、共产主义灯塔集体农庄和各农业生产合作社，帮助制订生产计划，并和古城镇的一个农庄和部分农业生产合作社签订了代耕合同。绥化宝山农业机器拖拉机站组织了七十四名职工深入十六个村六十七个农业生产合作社动员备耕，并帮助许多社、组农民研究了增产方法，大大地推动了该站服务范围内的备耕工作，施肥面积原来占总面积的百分之五十，现在提高到百分之七十。海伦国兴农业机器拖拉机站派出两个工作组到双泉、民众等村帮助做了种子发芽试验。讷河等农业机器拖拉机站还派人复查农业生产合作社耕地质量，在发现雪少地干的情况后，立即邀请老农研究出“带雪捞地、趁浆镇压”的抗旱办法。
