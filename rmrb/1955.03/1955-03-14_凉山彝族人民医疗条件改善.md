Under the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the medical conditions of the Yi people in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region in Xikang Province are improving day by day.

In the past three years, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region has established seven health centers, one health clinic, and four health stations, as well as an epidemic prevention team. At the beginning, there were only four health workers, but now there are 172, including 23 Yi people. In the past three years, these hospitals and epidemic prevention teams have treated a total of 422,090 illnesses for people of all ethnic groups; provided modern midwifery services for 437 people; vaccinated 1,800 people against typhoid fever; and vaccinated 50,990 people against smallpox. Last year, only one case of smallpox was discovered in the entire region.

The Yi people are very grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government. Mo Shi'a Nian, a leader from Jiaojihe, Butuo County, said: "In the past, when measles spread here, three or four people died every day. Now that we have hospitals, no one has died from measles." An Dengjun, a leader from Migu District, Jinyang County, said: "Once I got sick and killed dozens of cattle and sheep to drive away ghosts and pray to gods, but I didn't get better. Later, it was the doctor from the People's Government who cured me." In Zhaojue County, Yi woman Pi Te'a Jia had lost four children at birth. When she gave birth to her fifth child, she asked a midwife to use modern midwifery, and the child survived. When Yi woman Wa'er from Sujiaduo Village, Butuo County, was giving birth, the placenta would not come out. In a critical moment, the health center sent someone to remove the placenta for her. Wa'er's mother was so grateful that she shed tears. She said: "You saved my daughter-in-law and my child." (Xikang Province Xichang Mass Newspaper Correspondent Group)

    凉山彝族人民医疗条件改善
    在共产党和人民政府的关怀下，西康省凉山彝族自治区的医疗条件日益改善。
    三年来，凉山彝族自治区共建立了七个卫生院、一个卫生所、四个保健站，还建立了一个防疫队。卫生工作人员开头时只有四个人，现在已经有一百七十二个人，里面还有二十三个人是彝族。三年来，这些医院和防疫队，一共替各族人民医治了四十二万二千零九十次病；给四百三十七人用新法接生；给一千八百人打了伤寒防疫针；给五万零九百九十人种了牛痘。去年全区只发现一个人得天花。
    彝族人民非常感谢共产党和人民政府。布拖县交际河头人么什阿念说：“过去我们这里有麻疹流行，一天要死三四个人。现在有了医院，出了麻疹没有死一个人。”金阳县咪姑区头人安登俊说：“我有一次害了病，杀了几十条牛羊赶鬼求神，病也没好，后来还是人民政府的医生给我医好了。”昭觉县彝族匹特阿呷过去生了四个孩子都死了，生第五个孩子时，请助产士用新法接生，孩子养活了。布拖县苏呷斯多村彝族瓦尔生小孩时，胎盘下不来，正在危急时，卫生院派人替她取下胎盘。瓦尔的母亲感激得流下了眼泪。她说：“你们救活了我的媳妇，又救活了我的孩子。”（西康省西昌群众报通讯组）
