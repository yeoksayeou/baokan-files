Major Coal Mines Will Adopt Prefabricated Reinforced Concrete Supports

    In order to save timber, reduce coal mining costs, and save railway transportation capacity, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has decided to vigorously promote prefabricated reinforced concrete roadway supports in major coal mines across the country. It has also decided to establish six manufacturing plants in the Fushun, Fuxin, Kailuan, Fengfeng, Huainan, and Jiaozuo mining areas to mass-produce prefabricated reinforced concrete supports.

    Reinforced concrete roadway supports are one of the substitutes for wooden sheds successfully trial-produced by the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in 1952. After more than two years of field use, it has been proven that they can not only replace wooden sheds and metal sheds, but also replace bluestone or concrete linings. Its compressive strength is more than five times that of wooden sheds, and it can be used for fifteen to twenty years, while wooden sheds can only be used for an average of one and a half years. It is even better than wooden sheds, especially when used in roadways with uneven ground pressure, lateral pressure, or concentrated pressure. In terms of durability, one reinforced concrete support used in a coal mine roadway can replace ten wooden sheds. In terms of cost, the cost of reinforced concrete supports is only about 40% more expensive than wooden sheds. If used to replace bluestone or concrete linings, the efficiency can be improved more than five times due to convenient construction. Therefore, it is very cost-effective to use this type of reinforced concrete support for any roadway that needs to be maintained for more than three years. In addition, this reinforced concrete support is made of fire-resistant materials, which is very beneficial for fire prevention underground. Its compressive strength is also high, which can greatly reduce roof fall accidents. The above-mentioned six reinforced concrete support manufacturing plants will officially start production in July this year. It is estimated that 150,000 reinforced concrete supports will be produced this year. Replacing the consumption of ten wooden sheds with one reinforced concrete support is equivalent to saving 525,000 cubic meters of timber, worth more than 36 million yuan. Moreover, most of China's timber is produced in remote areas, generally more than 1,500 kilometers away from coal mines, requiring long-distance transportation. About three-quarters of the raw materials for reinforced concrete supports, such as sand and gravel, can be obtained locally, and they are manufactured in six manufacturing plants and supplied to nearby coal mines, which can save a lot of transportation capacity.

    The Ministry of Fuel Industry has now established an organization to promote prefabricated reinforced concrete supports. The Coal Mine Management Bureau has notified major units such as Fushun and Kailuan to designate engineering personnel and technical workers to go to the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau for internships, so that they can formulate practical plans for use after returning to their units.

    各大煤矿将采用装配式钢筋混凝土支架
    燃料工业部为了节省木材，降低采煤成本，节省铁路运输力量，决定在全国各大矿大力推广装配式钢筋混凝土坑道支架；并决定在抚顺、阜新、开滦、峰峰、淮南、焦作等矿区建立六个制造厂，大量制造装配式钢筋混凝土支架。
    钢筋混凝土坑道支架，是一九五二年焦作矿务局试制成功的木棚代用品之一，经二年多实地使用的结果，证明不仅可以代替木棚、金属棚，还可代替青石或混凝土砌?。它的抗压能力超过木棚五倍以上，能使用十五年到二十年，而木棚平均只能使用一年半。特别是使用于地压不均衡、侧压或集中压力较大的坑道，它更较木棚优越。在持久方面，在煤矿坑道中使用一架钢筋混凝土支架，可以代替十架木棚。在成本方面，钢筋混凝土支架的造价仅较木棚贵约百分之四十。如果用以代替青石或混凝土砌?，由于施工方便，效率更可提高五倍以上。所以凡坑道需要维持三年以上的，用这种钢筋混凝土支架，都非常合算。此外，这种钢筋混凝土支架，是用耐火材料构成的，对井下防火非常有利；它的耐压强度又大，更可以大大减少冒顶事故。上述六个钢筋混凝土支架制造厂将在今年七月正式生产，预计今年将生产钢筋混凝土支架十五万架，以一架钢筋混凝土支架代替十架木棚的消耗，就等于节省了五十二万五千立方公尺的木材，折价三千六百多万元。而且我国木材多产于边远地区，一般距离煤矿约在一千五百公里以上，需要长途运输。钢筋混凝土支架约有四分之三以上的原料如砂和碎石等都可就地取材，而且分在六个制造厂制造，供应附近煤矿使用，可以节省大量运输力。
    现在燃料工业部已成立了推广装配式钢筋混凝土支架的组织，煤矿管理总局已通知抚顺、开滦等各大单位，指定工程人员和技术工人前往焦作矿务局实习，以便回至本单位后制订实际使用计划。
