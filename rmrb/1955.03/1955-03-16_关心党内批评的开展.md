    Concern for the Development of Intra-Party Criticism
    The Qingdao Daily published several reports in February reflecting the development of criticism and self-criticism by the Party organization of the Qingdao No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory. These reports exposed the serious situation and its adverse consequences whereby the Party committee and its affiliated branches of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory were previously unable to carry out criticism and self-criticism. For example, the responsible cadres of the weaving workshop branch of the factory became complacent and detached from the masses because they did not engage in criticism and self-criticism for a long time, only seeing achievements and not shortcomings, even to the point of suppressing democracy and engaging in falsehoods. These reports also used concrete facts to illustrate that after the Party organization of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory reviewed its work in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and recently adopted practical measures to carry out criticism and self-criticism, a new look began to appear in the life of the Party: the collective leadership role of the Party committee was brought into play, Party unity was strengthened, the enthusiasm of Party members and the masses was enhanced, and the Party's supervisory and guarantee role in enterprise production was strengthened.
    After publishing reports on the activities of the Party organization of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, the Qingdao Daily also published an editorial pointing out that insufficient development of criticism and self-criticism was not an isolated phenomenon within the Qingdao municipal Party organization, and that Party organizations at all levels should pay attention to strengthening criticism and self-criticism. Based on the experience of the Party organizations of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and other units, the editorial also put forward some concrete suggestions on how to strengthen criticism and self-criticism. This not only aroused widespread attention among Party organizations at all levels to the issue of carrying out criticism, but also provided them with practical help in solving this problem.
    Fully developing intra-Party criticism and self-criticism is the central link in expanding intra-Party democracy and an important guarantee for implementing the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. Party newspapers have the responsibility to regularly report on the development of criticism and self-criticism by Party organizations, introduce experiences, point out shortcomings, and help Party organizations eliminate obstacles to carrying out criticism. This should become an important part of the Party life reports of the Party committees' newspapers at all levels. (Shixin)

    关心党内批评的开展
    青岛日报在二月份先后发表了反映国营青岛第三棉纺织厂党组织开展批评和自我批评情况的几篇报道，揭露了第三棉纺织厂党委会及其所属支部过去不能开展批评和自我批评的严重情况及其恶果。例如该厂织布车间支部的负责干部就因为长期不开展批评和自我批评，只看成绩不看缺点，而骄傲自满，脱离群众，甚至发展到压制民主和弄虚作假的危险地步。这些报道同时也用具体事实说明了，当第三棉纺织厂党组织根据党的七届四中全会决议精神检查了工作，并在最近采取实际措施开展了批评和自我批评后，党的生活就开始出现了新的面貌：党委会的集体领导作用发挥了，党内团结增强了，党员和群众的积极性提高了，党对企业生产的监督保证作用加强了。
    青岛日报在发表了关于第三棉纺织厂党组织活动的报道之后，还发表社论指出批评和自我批评开展得不充分，在青岛市党组织内并不是个别的现象，各级党组织都应当注意加强批评和自我批评。社论并根据第三棉纺织厂等单位党组织的经验，对如何加强批评和自我批评提出了一些具体意见。这就不仅引起了各级党组织对开展批评问题的广泛注意，而且在解决这个问题上给了它们切实的帮助。
    充分发展党内的批评和自我批评，是扩大党内民主的中心环节，也是贯彻党的七届四中全会决议的重要保证。党的报纸有责任经常反映党组织开展批评和自我批评的情况，介绍经验，指出缺点，帮助党组织消除开展批评方面的障碍。这应当成为各级党委机关报党的生活报道的一项重要内容。　（湜辛）
