    Localities Will Expand Experiments with Mixed Fertilization Methods
    Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture, based on the suggestion of Soviet expert Bunyak, arranged for agricultural science research institutes and farms in various localities to conduct experiments on mixed fertilization methods. According to the experimental results from various localities, it has been proven that if well-rotted manure or compost is used with mixed fertilization methods, only 300 to 400 jin need to be applied, which yields higher production than applying 4,000 jin of manure alone. Last year, the late corn at the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute in Beijing, which used mixed fertilizer (400 jin of manure, plus 66 jin of limestone powder and 40 jin of phosphate rock powder per mu), yielded 158 jin per mu, an increase of more than 5 jin per mu compared to the yield of manure applied alone. Moreover, the quality of the corn also improved. The rice at the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, which used mixed fertilizer (226 jin of compost, plus 26.6 jin of phosphate rock powder and 40 jin of lime per mu), yielded 27 jin per mu more than the rice with compost applied alone. Farms in Leshan, Emei and other counties have also achieved increased production by using mixed fertilizer. In order to further study the effectiveness of mixed fertilization methods, the Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice to various localities, instructing them to continue conducting experiments based on last year's results, and to appropriately expand the scope of experiments and the types of experimental crops, according to specific conditions. It also requires agricultural departments in various localities to strengthen their leadership over the experimental work, earnestly carry out the experimental work, and create conditions for improving fertilization methods in our country in the future.

    各地将扩大试验混合施肥法
    农业部去年根据苏联专家布尼亚克的建议，曾布置各地农业科学研究所及农场进行混合施肥法的试验。根据各地试验结果证明：腐熟的厩肥或堆肥，若用混合施肥法，只需施用三、四百斤，比单施四千斤所得的产量还要高。北京华北农业科学研究所去年施用混合肥料（每亩四百斤厩肥，加石灰石粉六十六斤和磷矿石粉四十斤）的晚玉米，每亩产一百五十八斤，比单施厩肥的每亩产量增加五斤多。而且玉米的品质也提高了。四川省农业科学研究所施用混合肥料（每亩用二百二十六斤堆肥，加磷矿石粉二十六点六斤和石灰四十斤）的水稻，每亩的产量比单施堆肥的增加二十七斤。乐山、峨嵋等县农场施用混合肥料也都获得增产的效果。为了更深入研究混合施肥法的效用，农业部最近又向各地发出通知，指示各地根据具体条件，在去年的基础上继续进行试验，并适当扩大试验范围及试验作物种类。还要求各地农业部门加强对试验工作的领导，切实做好试验工作，为我国今后改进施肥方法创造条件。
