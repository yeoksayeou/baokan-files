Report on the Basic Situation of Agricultural Production in 1954 and Current Measures for Increasing Agricultural Production
(Approved by the Sixth Plenary Session of the State Council on March 3, 1955)
Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan

The Ministry of Agriculture originally planned to hold a National Agricultural Work Conference in January 1955. Later, because the directors of the agricultural departments (bureaus) of each province (city) participated in the Second National Provincial (Municipal) Planning Conference convened by the State Planning Commission, the National Agricultural Work Conference was merged with the agricultural group of the National Provincial (Municipal) Planning Conference. Now, based on the results of the conference discussions, the basic situation of agricultural production in 1954 and current measures to increase agricultural production are reported as follows:

(1) The agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in 1954 was successful, but there were also shortcomings and problems.

First, driven by the victorious advance of the overall socialist construction and socialist transformation, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement was relatively rapid. Before the spring plowing in 1954, there were 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives. After the summer harvest, 120,000 new cooperatives were established, and there was a great development before and after the autumn harvest. By early February 1955, the total number of new and old cooperatives was nearly 600,000, and the number of peasant households participating in the cooperatives accounted for 13 percent of the total number of peasant households, of which more than 30 percent were in the old liberated areas such as North China and Northeast China. The development of the movement was rapid and, generally speaking, healthy and normal. Mutual aid teams have also developed to a certain extent. Most of the 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives that existed before the spring plowing in 1954 had varying degrees of increased production, which widely demonstrated the superiority of the socialist economy among the masses.

Second, under the attack of floods rarely seen in a century (local areas also suffered from drought and frost), due to the vigorous development of drainage, seedling rescue, rush planting, replanting in disaster areas, and over-production movement in non-disaster areas, the total grain output in 1954 still increased by about 3 percent compared with 1953, and oil crops and other cash crops (except cotton) also had varying degrees of increased production. The aquatic product plan is expected to be completed. Except for buffalo and sheep, the development plans for other large livestock and pigs have also been completed.

Third, various tasks of the agricultural sector have also been improved. Among technical cadres and scientific research institutions, the idea of "serving the promotion of cooperation and the improvement of agricultural production" has been clarified, and the style of going deep into the countryside, going deep into the masses, and combining science and technology with mass production practice has been promoted. The development and rectification of technical extension stations, the promotion of new agricultural tools, the promotion of improved varieties, the improvement of cultivation techniques, and the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests and other production-increasing measures have become mass practical actions in some areas. A large number of accountants, technicians, and farm implement operators were trained for agricultural production cooperatives, and the cooperatives were helped to improve their management, which played a certain role in promoting the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The supply of new agricultural tools, pesticides and machinery, and fertilizers was improved in coordination with industrial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives. Farmland water conservancy was developed in coordination with water conservancy departments. Provincial, prefectural, and county farms were rectified, tractor stations were established on a trial basis, and their demonstration role was strengthened. Livestock breeding and veterinary disease prevention and control work were carried out. The operation and management of state-owned mechanized farms, pastures, and aquatic product enterprises have been improved. The state of low output and high cost of state-owned farms has been basically changed, and aquatic product enterprises have overfulfilled the profit delivery plan.

The agricultural production in 1954 achieved certain results under extremely unfavorable natural conditions. This was achieved due to the high enthusiasm of the broad masses (including farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, and employees of state-owned agricultural, animal husbandry, and fishery enterprises), the improvement of socialist consciousness, and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and due to the close leadership of party and government at all levels and the efforts of cadres in agricultural departments at all levels.

Fourth, on the other hand, the shortcomings and problems in agricultural work also exist. The most serious problem at present is that the grain and cotton production increase plans have not been completed for two consecutive years (the first two years of the first five-year plan), which has deepened the tension in the supply of grain and cotton, further showing that the development of agricultural production cannot keep up with the national industrialization and the needs of the people for agricultural products, and has also increased the agricultural production increase tasks for the next three years. Not only grain and cotton, but also economic crops such as oil crops, silk, tea, tobacco, and hemp, as well as animal husbandry and aquatic products, are generally in short supply.

Serious natural disasters are indeed an important reason for this situation, but insufficient subjective efforts and shortcomings in work must be reviewed. The main manifestations of the shortcomings are: The idea of relying on mutual aid and cooperation to develop agricultural production is generally clear, but the actual work of agricultural tool promotion, technical guidance, cadre training, and other economic assistance is still lagging behind the development of the cooperation movement. The understanding and research of the development and changes of the entire national economy and the agricultural resources of various places are still insufficient, and there is a lack of overall planning for the development of agricultural economy, and the accuracy of the plan is poor. Some cadres in the Ministry of Agriculture and agricultural departments at all levels still have problems with their ideology and work style, their understanding of the current objective reality is not deep and comprehensive, and in specific work, they sometimes unilaterally emphasize needs and deviate from reality; they do not deeply understand that agricultural work is specific and detailed economic work, and they are often accustomed to treating this specific economic work with mobilization methods and general appeals; they also have insufficient understanding that the object of agricultural work is mostly scattered small-scale farmers, and they are not good at using the working method of the mass line when implementing various production increase measures, either forcing orders or letting things go. These shortcomings must be improved in future work.

(2) The agricultural production increase tasks for the last three years of the first five-year plan are arduous, and there are many difficulties, but the tasks must be completed and can also be completed.

Since my country entered planned economic construction, the question of how the development of agricultural production can generally adapt to the development of national industrialization and people's needs has been put on the agenda. First of all, the needs of farmers' living consumption are very different from those before the land reform and before liberation. At that time, farmers could not eat enough or wear warm clothes. Now the grain that farmers harvest is their own, so they not only want to eat enough, but also want to eat finer. Calculated with a population of 500 million in rural areas across the country, eating one tael of grain more per person per day will increase grain consumption by 11 billion catties a year. Eating two taels of oil more per person per month will increase edible oil consumption by 750 million catties a year. Farmers sell grain, put tickets in their pockets, and want to buy more cloth. If farmers across the country wear one chi more cloth per year, the consumption will increase by 5 million bolts of cloth a year. At the same time, industry has developed, and the population of cities and industrial and mining areas has increased, and the supply of commercial grain has also increased accordingly. The light industry that manufactures daily necessities such as textiles has developed, and the amount of industrial raw material crops such as cotton needed has also expanded. In order to exchange for the necessary industrial equipment, a certain amount of agricultural products must be exported. Therefore, if agricultural production cannot keep up, it will disrupt the country's economic construction plan, affect the speed of national industrialization and the continued improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people, and affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

In recent years, agricultural production has been developing year by year, but the speed of development is still not keeping up with the growth of objective requirements, so grain, cotton, oil crops, and some agricultural products have shown some phenomena of supply falling short of demand. The fundamental solution is to work hard to produce, and the production increase tasks of various agricultural products in the last three years of the first five-year plan are very large. Judging only from the production increase targets of grain and cotton in 1955, the total grain output must increase by 20 billion catties compared with 1954, and the total cotton output must increase by about 4.5 million dan compared with 1954. The task of increasing agricultural production is arduous.

Is it difficult to complete the task of increasing production? There are many difficulties.

First, although nearly 600,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, and the number of peasant households participating in the cooperatives has accounted for 13 percent of the total number of peasant households, more than 85 percent of the peasant households are still scattered small-scale production, and although mutual aid teams work collectively, the management is still scattered. The scattered small-scale agricultural economy is not compatible with the requirements for a large increase in agricultural production.

Second, we are currently in the process of implementing socialist transformation for small-scale farmers, and it is difficult to completely avoid some adverse effects on production. The unified purchase and sale of grain and agricultural cooperation are indispensable measures for socialist transformation, and they are fundamentally beneficial to the development of agricultural production and fully conform to the interests of the broad masses of farmers. This is beyond doubt. However, it is contradictory to the spontaneous capitalist sentiments and habits of small-scale peasant producers. Some farmers with more surplus grain resist the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain; in addition, the unified purchase and sale of grain does not yet have a complete set of methods, the distribution of tasks in some places is not very appropriate, and there are shortcomings in the implementation, the assessment of output is too high, and the retention of rations and feed is tight, which has created tension in rural areas. There are also individual places and some peasant households where the assessed output is too low and the supply standard is too high, and this unfair and unreasonable situation has also aroused dissatisfaction among farmers. A large number of new cooperatives were developed before and after the autumn harvest in 1954, and then they were busy with the unified purchase and sale of grain, while relaxing the rectification and consolidation of the cooperatives. In addition, some landlords, rich peasants, and hidden counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, which caused some farmers (mainly middle peasants) to have unstable production emotions and low enthusiasm for adding vehicles and buying horses, purchasing agricultural tools, and organizing land to expand reproduction. In a few areas, there have also been phenomena such as a sharp drop in livestock prices and indiscriminate slaughter of plowing animals. These are all unfavorable to the development of agricultural production.

Third, the production and supply of agricultural means of production cannot keep up, and science and technology cannot keep up. To develop production, fertilizer is needed everywhere, and the shortage of commercial fertilizer is a problem that is difficult to completely solve in the long term. The 1955 plan calls for the promotion of 400,000 new-style animal-powered agricultural tools, and some provinces have also requested an increase. At present, my country cannot produce agricultural machinery itself, nor can it import agricultural machinery in large quantities. The improvement of cultivation techniques cannot keep up, and there are not enough technical cadres.

Fourth, the country's financial resources are limited. In order to concentrate efforts on developing heavy industry, the state's investment in agriculture in the first five-year plan is not very large. Without a lot of investment and without a lot of machinery, it is impossible to reclaim wasteland on a large scale. According to the standards of the existing state-owned mechanized farms, it costs at least 40 to 50 yuan to reclaim one mu of wasteland, and it costs 4 to 5 billion yuan to reclaim 100 million mu of wasteland, which is impossible for the current financial resources.

Fifth, every year, some areas reduce production due to disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and insects. The disaster situation in 1954 was particularly serious, with an estimated reduction in grain production of more than 25 billion catties, and the reduction in grain production due to disasters in 1953 was more than 10 billion catties. This problem cannot be completely solved in a short period of several years.

In short, there are many difficulties, but there are also favorable conditions for completing the task.

The first favorable condition is relying on the development of mutual aid and cooperation. Facts have proved that the output of mutual aid teams is higher than that of individual farmers, and the output of agricultural production cooperatives is higher than that of mutual aid teams. Because agricultural production cooperatives implement unified management, they can rationally use land, plowing animals, and agricultural tools, rationally organize labor, and better promote various production increase measures, and increase agricultural production more. Agricultural production cooperatives have an average increase in production of 15 to 20 percent, and some are even higher. This is something that can be relied upon. Rely on cooperation, rely on the labor enthusiasm and socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers to realize the requirements for increasing agricultural production.

Second, the potential for increasing agricultural production is still very large. The amount of grain harvested from one mu of paddy field is very different from the amount of grain harvested from one mu of dry land. Using improved varieties can greatly increase output. The same one mu of dry land can also increase output a lot by planting high-yield crops such as corn. The unit area yield of ordinary farmers is also very different from the high-yield records of labor heroes. The output is also very different in the same village with the same land. In a village, the harvest volume of middle peasants' land is often higher, because they have complete livestock and agricultural tools, timely management, and more fertilization; the harvest of poor peasants is worse, which is a very common phenomenon. This proves that there is potential for increasing production, and there is a lot to be done. In addition, strengthening the fight against natural disasters and reducing disaster losses is also an aspect of tapping the potential for increasing production.

Third, rationally use limited financial and material resources, and achieve spending less money and doing more things, using one yuan as two yuan. As long as limited financial and material resources are used rationally, some things can still be done. In this regard, we must oppose the kind of situation where there is no idea when setting the plan, "dominate the budget" and "dominate the establishment," and in fact there are not so many cadres, and the money cannot be spent, and the result is either spending indiscriminately or handing over the year-end surplus; random spending is of course a waste of state property, and handing over the year-end surplus delays the development of the country's construction because the country's limited funds are held up for a year.

The fourth and most important favorable condition is the leadership of the Party. Recently, the CPC Central Committee instructed the provincial party committees to make agricultural production the central task, which is a strong guarantee for increasing agricultural production. Agricultural departments at all levels must, under the leadership of the party committee and the government, earnestly do their specific business work, rely on the leadership of the Party, mobilize all farmers, and launch a universal and enthusiastic agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

If all these favorable conditions are used well, the arduous task of increasing production can be completed and must be completed.

(3) How to complete the task of increasing agricultural production

First, implement the Party's class policy in rural areas, rely on mutual aid and cooperation, and develop agricultural production. To implement the class policy in the development of mutual aid and cooperation, it is necessary to rely on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) and consolidate the unity of the middle peasants. We must adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, oppose disguised rich peasant exploitation in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and prevent poor peasants from suffering losses; we must also overcome phenomena such as the premature and over-hasty implementation of valuing livestock as collective property of the cooperative, but the valuation is too low, the repayment period is too long, and the remuneration for privately owned and publicly used plowing animals is too low, and prevent infringing on the interests of the middle peasants. Land remuneration should be slightly lower than labor remuneration, but it should not be too low. When apportioning the production funds required by the cooperative, poor peasants who are unable to pay should be taken care of on the basis of the conscious and voluntary basis of new and old middle peasants, but the burden on new and old middle peasants should not be too heavy. In the leading components of the cooperative, it is necessary to establish the advantage of poor peasants and new middle peasants, but also to allow old middle peasants to account for three-tenths. In short, the relationship between poor peasants and middle peasants must be straightened out in order for the agricultural cooperation movement to develop healthily and to minimize the adverse effects on production that are inevitable in the socialist transformation process.

Production is not an isolated matter, and we must also act according to the class policy. We are developing agricultural production under the general premise and environment of socialist transformation, and first of all, we cannot develop the rich peasant economy, otherwise it will not be compatible with the general premise and will violate the Party's general line during the transition period. In the specific work of production, we must also implement the class policy, and we must rely on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) and consolidate the unity of the middle peasants.

Many production increase technologies must be promoted through mutual aid and cooperation. The reason why cooperatives can increase production is because they have adopted these measures. When cooperatives are organized, labor, land, plowing animals, etc. are used rationally, and labor enthusiasm is improved, if new animal-powered agricultural tools and small-scale water conservancy cannot keep up, and seed improvement and technical improvement cannot keep up, the efficiency of increasing production will be difficult to give full play. Various production increase measures are promoted by cooperatives, and in turn, these measures help the consolidation and development of cooperatives. In the cooperation movement, cooperatives lead the great development of mutual aid teams. In production work, cooperatives should also lead mutual aid teams and the broad masses of farmers to improve agricultural technology, promote production increase measures, increase unit area yield, and increase agricultural production. This is the main way to increase agricultural production in the current period, before my country can mass-produce agricultural machinery.

Second, ensure the specific measures for increasing agricultural production

(A) Rationally, fully, and effectively use land. This requires each province and county to conduct a survey and study of the local natural conditions such as soil, climate, rainfall, and water conditions, as well as the cultivation habits of the masses, and then, according to the local characteristics, propose a current feasible plan for increasing production measures in light of local conditions. It doesn't matter if this plan is rough at the beginning, and it can be gradually refined in the process of practice. The "Three Changes" plan proposed by Anhui Province based on the characteristics of the Huaibei area, changing (increasing) the proportion of summer-harvested crops in the entire crop, changing to planting high-yield crops and water-resistant crops, and changing the extensive cultivation habits, is a good example. The specific content of the "Three Changes" may not be promoted everywhere, but the working method of Anhui Province can be imitated everywhere.

My country has better climatic conditions. Except for some areas where only one crop can be planted a year, most areas can increase the multiple cropping index on the premise of improving water conservancy and opening up sources of fertilizer. In some places, the unit area yield of grain crops is too low. In addition to making efforts to improve from all aspects, we should also make up our minds in terms of crop varieties. We should, on the premise of maintaining the basic balance of the variety needs of commercial grain, plant more high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes according to local natural conditions and the eating habits of the masses. This is a quick and effective way to increase unit yield, and it should be actively promoted. There are still many scattered or small pieces of reclaimable wasteland in various places. In some places, the masses can be widely mobilized to reclaim and utilize them under the premise of maintaining soil and water. For example, Heilongjiang Province's method of collectively reclaiming wasteland by cooperatives setting up branches is a good method. For example, the requirements for developing tropical crops put forward by Guangdong and other provinces based on their unique climatic conditions are very good, and specific plans should be formulated and actively promoted.

There are still many mountainous areas that have not been developed. In 1954, many provinces put forward preliminary plans for mountain production, but there are not many who have seriously taken the mountain plans deep into the masses, discussed them with the masses, and then formulated a mountain development plan for one county and one township. The examples of Kaihua County in Zhejiang, Pingyi County in Shandong, and Pingshun County in Shanxi are very good examples to follow. At the recent forestry conference held by the Ministry of Forestry, it was required that all counties with mountainous areas that have not yet been developed across the country basically formulate an overall plan for mountain development by 1957, and agricultural departments should do their best to cooperate.

(B) In terms of improving cultivation techniques, it is required that cadres in various places, especially counties, go deep into the countryside, farmland, and farmers, find a high-yield household in a township or county, summarize his experience in achieving high yield, and then find surrounding farmers to conduct on-site visits and promote this advanced experience. This is easy for the masses to accept. This is the working method of the mass line. To lead the production increase movement of the broad masses of farmers, we must adopt the working method of the mass line. Cadres of technical extension stations must learn this working method. Of course, advanced cultivation techniques from outside that have been systematically summarized by scientific methods must also be actively absorbed and promoted to the masses after successful preliminary trials in local farms. Some advanced experiences (such as appropriate close planting) have proven to be able to increase production in many places and should be actively promoted. The principle that agricultural scientific research workers should go deep into the countryside and combine with the production experience of the farmers is correct, but we cannot ignore the experimental research work of agricultural scientific research institutions and experimental field stations.

The policy of rewarding labor models and the competition and evaluation movement are also better ways to promote advanced production experience among the masses and should be widely carried out within the scope of one township and one county.

(C) Various places universally require the construction of water conservancy, but the focus of the requirements is different, some focusing on flood control, some focusing on drainage, and some focusing on drought prevention and irrigation, and some have two or more requirements.

Water conservancy is an important measure to increase agricultural production with significant results. However, large-scale irrigation projects can only be built within our capabilities, and it is impossible to do more under the current conditions; and relying on a few large-scale water conservancy projects cannot solve the universal water conservancy requirements and cannot achieve large-scale production increases. Therefore, we must vigorously develop small-scale farmland water conservancy. As long as we are good at using the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the masses, we can do more small-scale water conservancy, do it universally, and the people can do it with government assistance, and the state spends little money and reaps great benefits. Agricultural departments should cooperate with water conservancy departments to do this work well.

(D) The improvement of agricultural tools is also an important production increase measure for a considerable period of time. During the first and second five-year plan periods, the number of agricultural machines is limited, and we must vigorously promote improved animal-powered agricultural tools. In the plain dryland areas (mainly the north), promoting new-style animal-powered agricultural tools such as double-wheel double-share plows is a very important task . The State Council has already approved the agreement signed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the First Ministry of Machine Industry, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. This year, 400,000 new-style animal-powered agricultural tools will be promoted, and a total of 1.5 million to 1.8 million will be promoted by 1957. The promotion plan will be proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the First Ministry of Machine Industry will be responsible for manufacturing, and the supply and marketing cooperatives will be responsible for the supply. In order to do a good job in the promotion of new-style agricultural tools, a large number of farm implement operators have been trained among farmers in various places to teach them how to use them; and blacksmith shops, bicycle shops, and iron factories have been organized to help farmers solve problems such as repairing and adding spare parts. In addition, the improved paddy field plows in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi have been proven to be effective after trial use and should be studied and promoted in rice-growing areas. There are also some ethnic minority areas that still use slash-and-burn cultivation, and the agricultural tools and cultivation techniques are very backward. We should help them solve the problem of agricultural tools and improve their cultivation techniques.

(E) The requirements for breeding plowing animals and improving the quality of plowing animals are becoming increasingly urgent with the promotion of new-style agricultural tools. For a considerable period of time, we must still rely mainly on livestock and animal-powered agricultural tools. Any view that belittles plowing animals and animal-powered agricultural tools is unrealistic and unfavorable to the development of agricultural production, and therefore is wrong. We must vigorously breed plowing animals, improve livestock breeds, and prevent and control animal diseases. In addition to running state-owned pastures, state-owned breeding stations, and veterinary undertakings, we must unite, educate, and use private veterinarians and livestock breeding households, and organize them to serve livestock breeding. It is also recommended that commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments carry out the business of transporting and selling plowing animals, organize private livestock dealers, and do a good job in the adjustment of plowing animals; this is an urgent task to help disaster areas restore production.

The breeding of pigs and sheep is closely related to fertilizers, non-staple foods, and exports. The task of breeding large and small livestock in the first five-year plan is very large. In addition to properly retaining the necessary feed in the unified purchase and sale of grain, we must also organize farmers to use the gaps in the fields, ridges, and houses to plant feed crops on idle land and abandoned land, which is an important guarantee for completing the task of livestock breeding.

(F) Promoting improved varieties is also a universally feasible and effective production increase measure. Promoting improved varieties does not necessarily require importing the most famous improved varieties from other places. According to the statistics of the seed conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture in December 1954, there are more than 1,000 kinds of folk improved varieties that are already known in various places, which can be widely promoted locally. The most important and universally effective way to promote improved varieties is to organize the masses to select and retain high-quality seeds themselves and to conduct organized exchanges of improved varieties among the masses. The promotion of foreign improved varieties is also something that should be strived for, but it must go through a certain trial planting and can only be promoted after success, which is slower to develop and not easy to popularize. In the past, in the work of promoting improved varieties by agricultural departments, some places did have phenomena of adventurism and forced orders, and some places let things go. Forced orders and letting things go are both wrong and must be corrected. We should actively educate the masses, inspire the masses' voluntariness, and carry out the work of promoting improved varieties.

Every year, some areas are affected by disasters, which is difficult to completely avoid in a few years. The seed adjustment work in disaster areas and the reserve of disaster relief seeds must be done well.

In addition, according to the reflection of many places, since the Ministry of Agriculture transferred the cotton improved variety ginning factory to the supply and marketing cooperatives for management in 1952, there has been a serious phenomenon of mixing and degradation of high-quality cotton seeds. It is requested that this batch of improved variety ginning factories be taken back and managed by the agricultural departments.

(G) Fertilizer and fertilization issues. Chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers are indeed insufficient, which is a long-term problem. We must actively strive to expand fertilizer sources. Some provinces have proposed methods to increase mineral fertilizers, which is good. More importantly, we must make full use of manure and natural fertilizers, and mobilize farmers to accumulate fertilizer, compost, and plant green manure.

Fertilization is unreasonable in some places, fertilization techniques must be improved, the method of scattering fertilizer must be changed, and fertilizer must be used sparingly and effectively.

Human and animal manure is the largest source of fertilizer and must be fully utilized. Some places still have the habit of people without toilets, pigs without pens, and planting land without fertilization. In this place, we must advocate fertilization and make increasing the fertilization area a planned indicator.

(H) For the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, we must adopt a policy of combining key prevention and control with universal prevention and control, combining mass general prevention and control, biological prevention and control, and medicine and machinery prevention and control, and we cannot only pay attention to key prevention and control and medicine and machinery prevention and control.

At present, we only pay attention to the prevention and control of a few serious plant diseases and insect pests such as rice borers and cotton bollworms, which is far from enough. In the second half of 1954, the Soviet plant protection expert delegation inspected China for half a year, went to many places, discovered many problems, and put forward many valuable suggestions; in a word, China's plant protection work is done too poorly. The agricultural department is determined to carry out this work conscientiously in 1955. There are not a few plant protection technical cadres and experts in China, and 60 percent of them teach in agricultural colleges and universities. Agricultural departments must be good at obtaining their help, combining their teaching work with local plant disease and insect pest control work, giving full play to their strength, so that they can make more contributions to agricultural production while teaching.

Not only in plant protection work should it be like this, but also in seed, fertilizer, cultivation technology, and various agricultural and animal husbandry production technologies, we must strengthen scientific experiment and research work, give full play to the strength of the technical cadres of agricultural departments, and maintain close contact with agricultural colleges and universities, and try our best to win the help of technical personnel teaching in colleges and universities, so that all technical cadres that can be used can be used to ensure the realization of the arduous task of increasing agricultural production from the perspective of science and technology.

(I) Vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work. From a long-term perspective, this is an extremely important task for agricultural production. Soil erosion is not only a serious problem in the Loess Plateau region of Northwest China, but also in Northeast China, due to the large-scale deforestation and the failure to keep up with the renewal of the logged areas, soil erosion is becoming increasingly serious; in many private forest areas in the south, there has also been a large-scale deforestation in recent years, with more cutting and less planting, and there are some concerns about private tree planting, and the situation is also serious. The experience created by Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces in soil and water conservation work is applicable to three different practices in three different regions (loess hilly area - building dams to silt up beaches, protecting slopes and consolidating ditches; plateau gully area - protecting the original and consolidating ditches; stone mountainous area - afforestation and grass planting, increasing coverage, storing water and intercepting sand, and slowing down runoff), which is very worthy of introduction and promotion. The Tianshui Prefecture in Gansu Province expects to achieve "fields with ridges, ridges connected, forests on slopes, and dams in ditches" during the first five-year plan period; if all localities can do the mass soil and water conservation projects that need to be done in their prefectures within a few years, it will be a major achievement.

Third, improve agricultural institutions below the county level

The county is the central link in leading agricultural production, and the agricultural institutions in the county are generally unsound. In the past, the Government Administration Council stipulated that all counties should set up agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy sections. Some provinces implemented this, while others merged the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy sections into the construction section to be managed by it concurrently. This organizational form is not commensurate with the task requirements. Therefore, it is requested that the State Council once again instruct all counties to set up agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy sections (or bureaus), and the number of personnel should be slightly increased. The number of personnel required for the increase should be uniformly adjusted and resolved by the provinces from the original number of personnel.

The agricultural technology extension stations in the districts are the organizational force to ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned production increase technology measures. Various places must gradually establish them within the controlled numbers of agricultural funds approved by the state, adhering to the principle of simplification, and it is required that there be stations in basically every district by 1957.

The staffing of cadres in the county agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy bureaus or sections and technical extension stations must pay attention to quality and must not be filled with incompetent people.

    关于一九五四年农业生产基本情况和当前农业增产措施的报告
    （一九五五年三月三日国务院全体会议第六次会议批准）
    农业部长  廖鲁言
    农业部原定在一九五五年一月召开全国农业工作会议，后因各省（市）农业厅（局）长都参加国家计划委员会召开的第二次全国省（市）计划会议，所以全国农业工作会议就与全国省（市）计划会议的农业组合并举行。兹根据会议讨论的结果，把一九五四年的农业生产基本情况和当前增加农业生产的措施报告如下：
    （一）一九五四年一年内，以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动是有成绩的，但也存在着缺点和问题
    第一，在全面的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业胜利前进的推动下，互助合作运动的发展是比较迅速的。一九五四年春耕以前有十万个农业生产合作社，夏收以后建立的新社有十二万个，秋收前后又有很大的发展。到一九五五年二月初，新老社合计已近六十万个，入社农户已占农户总数的百分之十三，其中华北、东北等老解放区已达百分之三十以上。运动的发展是迅速的，一般说来也是健康的，正常的。互助组也有一定的发展。一九五四年春耕前已有的十万个农业生产合作社，大多数都有不同程度的增产，这就在群众中广泛地显示了社会主义经济的优越性。
    第二，在百年少有的洪水袭击下（局部地区还有旱灾和霜灾），由于大力开展了灾区的排涝、救苗、抢种、补种和非灾区的超额增产运动，一九五四年的粮食总产量较一九五三年仍增加了约百分之三，油料和其他经济作物（除棉花外）也都有不同程度的增产。水产计划预计可以完成。除水牛和羊以外，其他大牲畜和猪的发展计划也完成了。
    第三，农业部门的各项工作也有所改进。在技术干部和科学研究机关中明确了“为促进合作化和提高农业生产服务”的思想，发扬了深入农村、深入群众、科学技术与群众生产实践相结合的作风。发展和整顿了技术推广站，推广新式农具、推广良种、改良耕作技术和防治病虫害等增产措施，在部分地区已成为群众性的实际行动。为农业生产合作社训练了大批的会计员、技术员和农具手，帮助合作社改善经营管理，对于互助合作组织的巩固和发展起了一定的促进作用。协同工业部门和供销合作部门改善了新式农具、农药械和肥料等供应工作。协同水利部门发展了农田水利。整顿了省专县农场，试办了拖拉机站，加强了它们的示范作用。开展了牲畜配种和兽疫防治工作。国营机耕农场、牧场和水产企业的经营管理都有提高，国营农场产量低、成本高的状态已经有了基本的改变，水产企业超额完成了利润上缴计划。
      一九五四年的农业生产，在自然条件十分不利的情况下，取得了一定的成绩；这是由于广大群众（包括农民、牧民、渔民和国营农牧渔企业的职工）劳动热情的高涨，社会主义觉悟的提高和互助合作运动的发展，由于各级党政的抓紧领导和各级农业部门干部的努力而获得的。
    第四，另一方面，农业工作中的缺点和问题也是存在的。当前最严重的问题是：连续两年（第一个五年计划的头两年）都没有完成粮棉增产计划，这就加深了粮棉供应的紧张程度，更加显示出农业生产的发展赶不上国家工业化和人民对于农产品的需要，也加重了后三年的农业增产任务。不仅粮棉如此，油料、丝、茶、烟、麻等经济作物和畜牧、水产等，一般也都是供不应求的。
    客观上的严重自然灾害固然是造成这种情况的重要原因，但是主观上的努力不够和工作中的缺点则必须检讨。缺点的主要表现是：依靠互助合作来发展农业生产的思想一般是明确了，但是农具推广、技术指导、干部训练和其他经济援助等实际工作还落后于合作化运动的发展。对于整个国民经济的发展变化和各地农业资源的了解研究还很不够，对于发展农业经济缺乏全盘规划，计划的准确性差。农业部和各级农业部门中有些干部的思想方法和工作作风还有毛病，对于当前的客观实际认识不深刻，不全面，在具体工作中有时片面强调需要，而脱离实际；对于农业工作是具体细致的经济工作这一点体会不深，往往习惯于用动员方式和一般号召来对待这种具体经济工作；对于农业工作的对象多数还是分散的小生产的农民这一点也认识不足，在推行各种增产措施时还不善于运用群众路线的工作方法，或则强迫命令，或则放任自流。这些缺点都是今后工作中必须改进的。
    （二）第一个五年计划后三年的农业增产任务是艰巨的，困难也很多，但任务必须完成，也可以完成
    自从我国进入计划经济建设，农业生产的发展怎样才能跟国家工业化和人民需要的发展大体相适应的问题，就提到议事日程上来了。首先，农民生活消费的需要，跟土地改革以前、解放以前大不相同了，那时候农民吃不饱、穿不暖，现在农民打下来的粮食是自己的，就不仅要吃饱，而且要求吃细一点。全国农村以五亿人口计算，每人每天多吃一两粮食，一年就要增加一百一十亿斤粮食。每人每月多吃二两油，一年就要增加七亿五千万斤食油。农民卖了粮食，口袋里装了票子，就想多买点布，全国农民每人每年多穿一尺布，一年就要增加五百万匹布。同时，工业发展了，城市和工矿区的人口增加了，商品粮食的供应量也随着增加。纺织等制造人民生活日用品的轻工业发展了，它所需要的棉花等工业原料作物的数量也随着扩大。为了换进必要的工业设备，就不能不出口一定数量的农产品。所以，如果农业生产跟不上去，就会打乱国家的经济建设计划，影响国家工业化的速度和城乡人民生活的继续改善，影响工农联盟的巩固。
    几年以来，农业生产是逐年发展的，但是发展的速度还跟不上客观要求的增长，因而粮食、棉花、油料和若干农产品就呈现出某些供不应求的现象。根本解决的办法只有努力生产，第一个五年计划的后三年各项农产品的增产任务都很大。单就一九五五年粮食和棉花的增产指标看：粮食总产量要比一九五四年增加二百亿斤，棉花总产量要比一九五四年增加约四百五十万担。农业增产任务是艰巨的。
    完成增产任务是不是有困难呢？困难是很多的。
    第一，现在虽然已经建立起近六十万个农业生产合作社，参加社的农户已占农户总数的百分之十三，但是百分之八十五以上的农户仍然是分散的小生产，互助组虽然集体劳动，经营还是分散的。分散的小农经济跟大量增加农业生产的要求是不相适应的。
    第二，目前正处在对小生产的农民实行社会主义改造的过程中，暂时发生某些对生产不利的影响是很难完全避免的。粮食统购统销和农业合作化，都是社会主义改造不可缺少的措施，根本讲来对于发展农业生产都是有利的，也完全符合于广大农民的利益，这都是毫无疑问的。但是它跟农民小生产者的自发资本主义情绪和习惯势力是有矛盾的。一部分余粮较多的农民对于粮食统购统销政策就有抵触；再加上粮食统购统销还没有完整的一套办法，有些地方任务分派不很恰当，执行中又有缺点，评定产量偏高，口粮和饲料留的紧，这就在农村中造成了紧张现象。也有个别地方和部分农户评定产量偏低，供应标准偏高，这种不公平不合理的情况也引起农民不满。在农业合作化方面，由于发展较快而经验不足、准备不够，工作较粗，合作社的各项具体政策还缺乏统一详明的规定，在下层实际工作中就难免有些地方未能切实贯彻自愿互利原则，或者在处理有关社员实际问题时照顾不周；也由于有的地方对合作化的政策和步骤宣传解释不够或不很恰当，部分农民对合作化还有若干怀疑和误解。一九五四年秋收前后发展了一大批新社，紧接着就忙于粮食的统购统销，而放松了合作社的整顿巩固工作。再加上一部分地主、富农分子和潜伏的反革命分子乘机造谣破坏，从而引起一部分农民（主要是中农）的生产情绪不够稳定，对于添车买马、购置农具和整理土地以扩大再生产的积极性不高。少数地区还出现了畜价大跌，滥宰耕畜等现象。这对于农业生产的发展都是不利的。
    第三，农业生产资料的生产和供应跟不上、科学技术也跟不上。要发展生产，到处要肥料，而商品肥料不足是长时期内难以完全解决的问题。一九五五年计划推广四十万架新式畜力农具，有些省份还要求增加。现在我国还不能自己生产农业机器，也不能大量进口农业机器。耕作技术的改进也跟不上，技术干部也不够。
    第四，国家的财力有限，为了集中力量发展重工业，第一个五年计划中的国家在农业上的投资是不很多的。既没有很多投资，又没有很多机器，就不可能大规模地开荒。按现有国营机耕农场的标准，开垦一亩荒地，至少要投资四、五十元，开垦一亿亩荒地，就要四、五十亿元，这是目前的财力所不可能办到的。
    第五，每年都有若干地区因水旱风虫等灾害而减产。一九五四年灾情特别严重，减产粮食估计达二百五十亿斤以上，一九五三年也因灾减产粮食一百多亿斤。这个问题不是短短几年之内所能完全解决的。
    总之，困难是很多的，但是完成任务的有利条件也还是有的。
    第一个有利条件就是靠互助合作的发展。事实证明：互助组的产量高于个体农民，农业生产合作社的产量又高于互助组。农业生产合作社由于实行了统一经营，就能够合理使用土地、耕畜和农具，合理组织劳动力，就能够更好地推行各种增产措施，较多地增加农业生产。农业生产合作社平均增产百分之十五至二十，个别还有更高的。这是可以依靠的。靠合作化，靠广大农民群众的劳动积极性和社会主义觉悟的提高，来实现增加农业生产的要求。
    第二，农业的增产潜力还是很大的。一亩水田打的粮食和一亩旱地打的粮食相差就很多。引用良种就可以大大提高产量。同样的一亩旱地，改种玉米等高产作物，产量也可以提高很多。一般农民的单位面积产量跟劳动英雄的丰产记录相差也很多。同一个乡村同一样的土地，产量也很不一样。在一个乡村中，往往是中农土地的收获量高些，因为他牲口农具齐全，经营及时，施肥也多；贫农的收成就差些，这是很普遍的现象。这证明增产是有潜力的，很有文章可作的。此外，加强对自然灾害的斗争，减少灾害的损失，也是挖掘增产潜力的一个方面。
    第三，合理使用有限的财力和物资，要做到花钱少、办事多，一个钱当两个钱用。只要把有限的财力和物资合理地使用，还是能办些事的。在这方面，要反对那种在定计划时心中无数，“霸预算”、
  “霸编制”，实际上没有那么多干部，钱也花不出去，结果不是胡乱开支，就是年终结余上交；乱花固然是浪费国家财产，年终结余上交，就使国家有限的资金积压了一年，也同样耽误了国家建设事业的发展。
    第四个也是最重要的一个有利条件，就是党的领导。最近中共中央指示各省委要以农业生产做为中心工作，这就是增加农业生产的有力保证。各级农业部门必须在党委和政府的领导之下，认真做好自己的各项具体业务工作，依靠党的领导力量，把所有的农民发动起来，掀起一个普遍热烈的以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动。
    所有这些有利条件运用得好，艰巨的增产任务是可以完成的，也必须完成。
    （三）怎样完成农业增产任务
    第一，贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策，依靠互助合作，发展农业生产。在发展互助合作中要贯彻阶级政策，要依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），又要巩固地团结中农。必须坚持自愿互利的原则，既要反对互助合作组织中的变相富农剥削，不能让贫农吃亏；也要克服过早过急地实行牲畜折价归社公有，而折价过低，归还期限过长，以及私有公用的耕畜报酬过低等现象，防止侵犯中农利益。土地报酬应略低于劳动报酬，但也不宜过低。在分摊合作社所需要的生产资金时，对无力交付的贫苦农民应该在新老中农自觉自愿的基础上给以照顾，但也不能要新老中农负担过重。在合作社的领导成分中，要树立贫农和新中农的优势，但也要让老中农占十分之三。总之，贫农和中农的关系必须摆正，农业合作化运动才能健康地向前发展，才能使社会主义改造过程中难免发生的某些对生产不利的影响缩小到最小限度。
    生产不是一件孤立的事情，也要根据阶级政策办事。我们是在社会主义改造的大前提大环境下发展农业生产，首先就不能发展富农经济，否则就跟大前提不相适应，就违反了国家在过渡时期的总路线。在生产的具体工作中也要贯彻阶级政策，同样要依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农。
    许多增产技术措施要靠互助合作来推广，合作社所以能增产就是因为采取了这些措施。合作社组织起来，劳力、土地和耕畜等使用合理了，劳动积极性提高了，如果新式畜力农具、小型水利跟不上去，种子改良、技术改进也跟不上去，增产效率就难以很好发挥。各项增产措施靠合作社来推行，反过来这些措施又帮助合作社的巩固和发展。在合作化运动中是合作社带动互助组大发展。在生产工作中也应该是合作社带动互助组和广大农民，改进农业技术，推行增产措施，提高单位面积产量，增加农业生产。这就是在目前时期，在我国还不能大量制造农业机器以前，增加农业生产的主要途径。
    第二，保证农业增产的各项具体措施
      （甲）合理地、充分有效地利用土地。这就要求各省各县对当地的土壤、气候、雨量、水情等自然条件和群众的耕作习惯做一番调查研究，然后根据当地的特点，因地制宜地提出当前切实可行的增产措施方案。这个方案开始粗糙一些也不要紧，可以在实践过程中逐步具体化。安徽省根据淮北地区的特点所提出的“三改”计划，改变（增加）夏季收获的作物在整个农作物中所占的比重，改种高产作物和耐水作物，改变粗放的耕作习惯，这就是一个好的例子。“三改”的具体内容并不一定各地都可推行，但安徽省的这种工作方法是各地可以仿效的。
    我国气候条件较好，除部分地区一年只能种一季以外，多数地区在改善了水利和开辟了肥源的前提下，可以增加复种指数。有些地方粮食作物的单位面积产量过低，除从各方面努力提高外，还应从作物品种方面打主意，应该在保持商品粮食的品种需要大体平衡的前提下，根据当地的自然条件和群众食用的情况，多种玉米和薯类等高产作物。这是提高单位产量的迅速有效的办法，应积极加以提倡。各地都还有不少零星的或小片的可垦荒地，有的地方可以较广泛地发动群众在保持水土的前提下垦殖利用起来，例如黑龙江省用合作社办分社的办法集体开荒，就是一种好的办法。又如广东等省根据当地特有的气候条件，所提出的发展热带作物的要求很好，应该订出具体计划，积极推行。
    还有很多山区没有开发，一九五四年内已有不少省份提出了山区生产的初步规划，但认真把山区规划深入到群众中去，经过群众讨论然后定出一县一乡的山区开发计划，这样做的还不多。浙江开化县、山东平邑县和山西平顺县等例子是很可效法的。最近林业部召开的林业会议上要求全国凡有山区尚未开发的各县在一九五七年内基本上都定出山区开发的总体规划，农业部门应该尽力配合进行。
    （乙）在改进耕作技术上，要求各地特别是县的干部深入到农村、农田和农民中去，在当地找出一乡一县的丰产户，把他所以能够丰产的经验总结起来，然后找来周围的农民进行实地参观，把这种先进经验加以推广。这是群众所易于接受的。这就是群众路线的工作方法。领导广大农民的增产运动，就必须采用群众路线的工作方法。技术推广站的干部，必须学会这种工作方法。当然外来的经过科学方法系统总结了的先进耕作技术也必须积极吸取，经过当地农场先行试验成功后再推广到群众中去。有些先进经验（例如适当密植）在许多地方已证明是可以增产的，应该积极推广。农业科学试验研究工作者应该深入农村，跟农民群众生产经验相结合的方针是正确的，但不能因而忽视农业科学研究机关和试验场站的试验研究工作。
    奖励劳模的政策和竞赛评比运动，也是推广群众中的先进生产经验的较好的办法，应该在一乡一县的范围之内广泛进行。
    （丙）各地普遍要求兴修水利，但要求的重点不一，有的着重于防洪，有的着重于排涝，还有的着重于防旱灌溉，也有的兼有两项以上的要求。
    水利是一项效果显著的增加农业生产的重要措施。但大型灌溉工程只能量力兴修，在目前的条件下不可能多办；而且靠少数几个大型水利工程，并不能解决普遍的水利要求，不能达到大范围的增产。因此，必须大力发展小型农田水利。只要善于
  运用群众的人力、物力、财力，小型水利就可以多办，普遍办，民办公助，国家花钱不多，收益很大。农业部门应该协同水利部门做好这一工作。
      （丁）农具改良也是相当时期内的一项重要的增产措施。在第一和第二个五年计划时期内农业机器数量有限，必须大力推广改良的畜力农具。在平原旱作地区（主要是北方），推广双轮双铧犁等新式畜力农具是很重要的一项工作。国务院已经批准农业部、第一机械工业部和供销合作总社所签订的协议，今年推广新式畜力农具四十万部，到一九五七年共推广一百五十万到一百八十万部，推广计划由农业部负责提出，第一机械工业部负责制造，供销社负责供应。为做好新式农具的推广工作，各地已在农民中间训练了大批农具手，教会他们使用；并组织了铁匠炉、自行车铺和铁工厂帮助农民解决修理和添配零件等问题。此外，广东、广西和江西改良的水田犁，经过试用，已有成效，应该在水稻地区研究推广。还有些少数民族地区现在还是刀耕火种，农具和耕作技术都很落后，应该帮助他们解决农具和提高耕作技术。
    （戊）繁殖耕畜和提高耕畜质量的要求，随着新式农具的推广而日益迫切。在相当长的时期内，主要还是靠牲畜和畜力农具，任何轻视耕畜和畜力农具的观点都是不实际的，都是不利于发展农业生产的，因而都是错误的。必须大力繁殖耕畜，改良畜种，防治兽疫，除办好国营牧场、国营配种站和兽医事业外，必须团结教育和使用民间兽医和喂养种畜户，组织他们为繁殖牲畜服务。并建议商业和供销合作部门开展贩运耕畜的业务，组织民间畜贩，做好耕畜的调剂工作；这是当前帮助灾区恢复生产的一项紧急任务。
    猪和羊的繁殖，跟肥料、副食品和出口的关系都很大。第一个五年计划中，大小牲畜的繁殖任务很大，除在粮食统购统销中适当留出必要的饲料外，还须组织农民利用田边地垄屋前屋后的隙地、休闲地和废弃土地种植饲料作物，这是完成牲畜繁殖任务的重要保证。
    （己）推广良种也是普遍可行的一种有效的增产措施。推广良种并不是非要从外地引进最有名的良种不可。据一九五四年十二月农业部召开的种子会议上的统计，各地已经知道的民间良种有一千多种，这是很可以在当地普遍推广的。推广良种最主要最普遍有效的办法就是组织群众自选自留优良种子，并在群众中有组织地进行串换良种。外来良种的推广也是应该努力的，但是必须经过一定的试种，成功后才能推广，开展起来较慢，也不容易普遍。过去农业部门在推广良种的工作中，有的地方确实有冒进和强迫命令现象，也有的地方放任自流。强迫命令和放任自流都是不对的，都要改正。应该积极教育群众，启发群众的自愿，开展良种推广的工作。
    每年都有部分地区受灾，这在若干年内是难以完全避免的。灾区种子调剂工作和救灾种子的储备工作必须做好。
    此外据许多地方反映，自一九五二年农业部把棉花良种轧花厂拨归供销合作社代管后，优良棉种发生混杂退化的严重现象，要求把这批良种轧花厂收回，归农业部门管理。
    （庚）肥料和施肥问题。化学肥料、饼肥确实不足，这是一个长期问题。必须积极努力扩大肥源。有的省已经提出增加矿肥的办法，这是好的。更重要的是充分利用厩肥和自然肥料，发动农家积肥、沤肥和种植绿肥。
    有的地方施肥不合理，施肥技术要改良，漫撒肥的办法要改变，肥料要节约有效的使用。
    人畜粪尿是最大的一项肥料来源，必须充分加以利用。有的地方还有人无厕、猪无圈，种地不施肥的习惯。这种地方就要提倡施肥，把增加施肥面积做为一项计划指标。
    （辛）防治病虫害，要采取重点防治和普遍防治相结合，群众性的一般防治、生物防治和药械防治相结合的方针，不能只注意重点防治和药械防治。
    现在还只注意到稻螟虫、棉铃虫等少数几种为害严重的病虫害的防治工作，这是非常不够的。一九五四年下半年苏联植物保护专家考察团在中国考察了半年，去了许多地方，发现了不少问题，提出了许多宝贵的意见；归总一句话，就是我国的植物保护工作做的太差了。农业部门决心在一九五五年内把这一工作认真开展起来。中国的植物保护技术干部和专家并不少，百分之六十在农学院校教书，农业部门必须善于取得他们的帮助，使他们的教学工作和当地的病虫防治工作结合起来，发挥他们的力量，使他们一面教学，一面直接为农业增产做出更多的贡献。
    不仅在植物保护工作方面应该如此，在种子、肥料、耕作技术以及农牧业各项生产技术方面，都必须加强科学试验研究工作，充分发挥农业部门技术干部的力量，并与农业院校密切联系，尽量争取在院校教学的技术人员的帮助，使一切可能运用的技术干部力量都运用起来，从科学技术方面来保证艰巨的农业增产任务的实现。
      （壬）大力开展水土保持工作。从长期着眼，这是对农业生产一项极关重要的工作。水土流失，不仅在西北黄土高原地区是当前的严重问题；在东北由于森林的大量砍伐，迹地更新跟不上去，水土流失日趋严重；在南方许多私有林地区，近数年来也是大量砍伐，砍的多，栽的少，私人栽树有所顾虑，情况也是严重的。甘肃、陕西、山西等省在水土保持工作方面所创造的经验，适用于三种不同地区的三种做法（黄土丘陵区——打坝淤滩、护坡固沟；高原沟壑区——保原固沟；石山区——造林植草、增加覆被、蓄水拦沙、减缓迳流），是很值得介绍推广的。甘肃天水专区预计在第一个五年计划期内做到：“田田有埂，埂埂相连，坡上有林，沟内有坝”；如果各地都能在几年之内把本专区内需要做的群众性的水土保持工程都做起来，那就是一项重大的成就。
    第三，健全县以下的农业机构
    县是领导农业生产的中心环节，而县的农业机构一般是不健全的，过去政务院曾经规定县一律设农林水利科，有的省份执行了，有的省份将农林水利科合并到建设科由它兼管农业生产。这种组织形式跟任务要求是不相称的。因此，请求国务院再一次指示各地县设农林水利科（或局），编制人数需略予增加，增加编制所需的名额，由省在原有编制人数中统一调剂解决。
    区的农业技术推广站，是保证贯彻上述各项增产技术措施的组织力量，各地必须在国家核定的农业经费控制数字之内，本精简的原则，逐步建立起来，要求在一九五七年内基本上做到区区有站。
    县农林水利局或科和技术推广站的干部配备必须注意质量，不得滥竽充数。
