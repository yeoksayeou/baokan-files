Enterprise Party Organizations Should Care About the Thoughts and Lives of the Workers

By Our Reporter An Gang

I. Political Work Should Be Combined with the Actual Thoughts of the Masses

In many factories, there is an abnormal phenomenon in the political work of the Party organizations. On the one hand, there are many political activities, mainly manifested in big and small meetings. The workers' spare time is almost entirely occupied by various kinds of meetings. Some factory Party committee secretaries say: "Even so, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League are all competing for time, complaining that it is not enough!" On the other hand, the places where political work is truly needed have become "blank spots." For example, the factory held mobilization meetings, both big and small, for competitions, but in the shifts or groups where completing tasks was most urgent and difficult, no one was there to specifically organize the competition, and no one was there to carry out mobilization. Also, Party organizations, administration, trade unions, and the Youth League are all vying for the workers' spare time from 4:30 PM to 7:00 PM, but no one goes to the workers' dormitories to organize political and cultural activities that can attract workers during their evening hours. No wonder workers often think: this kind of political work only talks about grand principles, and does not solve specific problems. Should political work talk about grand principles? Absolutely. When we talk about the grand principle of the Party's general line, don't the workers raise their socialist consciousness a step further? Grand principles should not only be talked about but should be talked about more. Without explaining the grand principles clearly, the small principles cannot be explained. The problem with our political work is not because we talk too much about grand principles. The problem is that we talk too little about scientific principles, and when talking about grand principles, we do not combine them with the specific problems in the workers' production and lives, and do not solve some of their immediate problems according to the spirit of the grand principles.

Why does this phenomenon occur?

This is because some comrades in the factory Party organizations still do not know how to do political work by combining it with reality. They think that political work is just reading from the book. I once saw a branch secretary talking to workers about the socialist transformation of agriculture, and he was reading from the book. The workers stared blankly and did not understand, but he couldn't do anything about it. In fact, this topic is very interesting, and the workers are very willing to know more about the affairs of the peasants. Unfortunately, the branch secretary forgot the preparation work he should have done before the speech. For example, he could ask the workers who came from the countryside about the actual living conditions in the countryside, and understand what the workers thought about agricultural collectivization. Then he should combine the Party's policies with these actual situations and specific problems to talk about it. In this way, the workers would feel close to it. More importantly, the branch secretary forgot that the target of his speech was the workers, and he should talk more about the relationship between the development of heavy industry (including the products of the factory) and agricultural collectivization, and talk about the responsibility of the working class to the peasant brothers. This would enable the workers to quickly accept the Party's policies and improve their production enthusiasm.

It can be seen that the strength of the Party's political work lies in combining the Party's principles and policies with the actual situation.

What is reality? Some people have a narrow view of this issue. They think that only production is reality, so they regard political work combined with reality only as mobilizing production. There is no doubt that combining political work with production is completely correct. The ultimate goal of all political work in the factory is to improve labor productivity, and the improvement of labor productivity is the decisive condition for us to build a socialist society. However, we should recognize that it is people who are engaged in production, and people play a decisive role in the process of improving labor productivity. People have all kinds of thoughts in the production process, and not only that, people must live and learn, and in the process of living and learning, there are also all kinds of thoughts, which are all the objects of the Party's political and ideological work. The Party's political and ideological work must solve the ideological problems of people in the production process, and also solve the ideological problems of people in the process of living and learning. Only in this way can the Party's political and ideological work be multifaceted, rich, and attractive; only in this way can the Party's political and ideological work be truly closely combined with reality.

II. From One Incident, We See the Serious Significance of Caring About the Lives of the Masses

The workers' thoughts and the workers' lives are closely related. Therefore, if the Party organization does not understand, study, and solve the workers' living problems, it is equivalent to abandoning political and ideological work.

I will give an example to illustrate the seriousness of this issue.

One Sunday, I went to the North Market in Shenyang, which is a place for mass activities. Some factories or construction sites had holidays on Sundays, and many workers came here to play. In a bustling alley, I saw a dozen fortune-telling stalls. Some set up a separate "photography studio," some put tables on the street, and some set up stalls on the ground. What caught my attention was that people were constantly telling fortunes and listening to fortunes at each stall. Many of them were workers, some of whom looked like workers from basic construction units, and some even wore factory badges.

These workers have their own different immediate problems, including marriage problems, family disputes, and job choices. These problems seem to be some personal trivial matters, but these trivial matters accumulate into a side of the workers' lives. If the Party organization cannot correctly and carefully help the workers solve these problems, they will have to spend money to consult the "fortune-telling physiognomists."

The fortune-teller listens to the "secrets" told by the workers, and focuses on everyone's weaknesses to attack them ideologically. His weapon is the reactionary fatalistic view covered by a mysterious coat. This fatalistic view is precisely conducive to the attack of the exploiting class ideology. It seizes the weaknesses in the workers' thoughts and the difficulties in their lives to attack. As a result, it can make workers with low awareness not believe in their own strength, not believe that the working class can control their own destiny, and even doubt the policies of the Party and the government. This kind of physiognomist who spreads fatalistic views, combined with entertainment venues that sing praises of feudalism and promote pornography, small book stalls that rent and read yellow books and pictorials, and "free markets" (some workers sleep during the day and go to the station to do small business at night), etc., is the source of the exploiting class's ideology that many of us do not pay attention to, but is eroding us at all times. This kind of reactionary and backward ideological influence is brought into the ranks of the working class and into the production posts through workers with low awareness and weak will. This is one of the ideological roots of workers' violation of labor discipline and illegal and undisciplined behavior. Therefore, if we do not start from caring about and solving the workers' immediate ideological and living problems, even if we individually deal with some illegal and undisciplined events and violations of labor discipline, the result will still not fundamentally purify the ranks of the working class.

Of course, this does not mean that once our Party organization strengthens its political and ideological work and cares about the workers' immediate problems, the above-mentioned backward phenomena will immediately disappear, nor does it mean that the above-mentioned backward phenomena prove that our Party organization has not carried out political and ideological work at all. Because the improvement of the working class's awareness is the result of our Party's long-term political and ideological education. However, only caring about the workers' production and not caring about the workers' ideological and living problems is a common and serious weakness in the current work of enterprise Party organizations. It is certain that this weakness has created a larger market for physiognomists to spread fatalism. The phenomenon of workers looking for physiognomists to tell fortunes that I mentioned above is related to this weakness, and it is undeniable.

III. How Can We Strengthen Political Work and Combine It with the Workers' Immediate Problems?

The most basic thing is that the Party organization must care about the workers' lives and their ideological trends. On the basis of the continuous improvement of the workers' ideological awareness, political work should be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Every ordinary worker, including the backward part of the workers, should be able to feel the Party's care intimately from their daily lives, and be able to confide in the Party what they think and feel, not only about production, but also about personal ideological and living problems, difficulties, and hopes, and ask the Party for guidance, help, and solutions. The Party organization should care about each worker's production achievements, and also care about their immediate problems.

Combining political work with the workers' immediate problems will definitely be effective. I can give a specific fact to illustrate the correctness of this experience. In a certain factory in Lushun, a worker in a foundry workshop suddenly produced two defective products in a row. The workshop cadres all said: "This person should be punished for producing defective products." The branch secretary said: "Don't punish him first, I will criticize him." When the Soviet expert heard this, he quickly asked the branch secretary:

"Do you know why he produced defective products in a row?"

"Because he was careless and negligent in his work," the branch secretary replied.

"Have you ever figured out why he was negligent?"

The branch secretary could not answer. The Soviet expert said: "The staff of the Party organization cannot criticize people based on superficial impressions. You should actually understand the reasons for his carelessness. If he has specific difficulties, you should help him solve them. If the defective products are entirely due to his lax labor discipline, it is not too late to criticize him."

The branch secretary went to the worker's home to investigate. He saw that the worker's wife was sick in bed and the children were not taken care of. Because he was uneasy, he produced defective products. The branch secretary proposed to the factory director to send his wife to the hospital for treatment and to settle the children. At the same time, he told him to concentrate on production. The worker was cared for and educated by the Party, and deeply realized the mistakes he had made in the past. From then on, he not only stopped producing defective products, but also greatly improved his labor productivity.

The Party organization should care about the immediate problems of every worker. While solving the workers' immediate problems, it should carry out vivid political work for the workers. The solution of each specific problem can greatly push the workers' thinking forward. As a result, the vast majority of workers will inevitably care more about and cherish the cause of the Party and the country, and improve their enthusiasm and creativity in production. In order to achieve this, we must pay attention to solving the following problems:

First, we must establish the idea of caring about the lives of the workers. We should correct the erroneous view that is popular among some comrades, that is, caring about the lives of the workers will politically make the workers' tails, and will foster the workers' selfish and self-interested thoughts of only caring about their own lives and welfare. Under the control of this wrong idea, these comrades only ask the workers to complete tasks every day, and do not pay attention to the workers' technical and political learning, clothing, food, housing, and transportation, wages and rewards, disease and health problems, etc. In fact, they do not understand the unity of individual interests and public interests under the socialist system. We should not only educate the workers to understand the truth that individual interests must be subordinate to public interests, but also see that the workers care about their labor achievements and the improvement of labor productivity from the unity of public interests and individual interests, which is precisely the force that promotes the workers' love of labor and the improvement of production. Canceling this point will erase the possibility and necessity of socialist competition, erase the combination of individual interests and public interests, and stifle the continuous growth of the workers' labor enthusiasm, which will inevitably hinder the development of production. The factory Party organization must not regard the workers' immediate problems as trivial matters. Perhaps these things themselves are insignificant, but it should be recognized that since these trivial matters are brought to the Party organization, they become principled problems, and they must be solved in accordance with the Party's policies, principles, viewpoints, and methods. Some responsible cadres of Party organizations cannot do this because their ideological level is low. However, how can it work if we don't do this? Today, it is very necessary for the comrades in charge of Party and administration in the factory to review Chairman Mao's instructions in the article "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work": "All practical problems in the masses' everyday life should claim our attention. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them and satisfy the needs of the masses, we shall really become organizers of the life of the masses, and they will really rally around us and warmly support us." Enterprise Party organizations should treat the workers in this way. If we learn this method of mass work, we will improve the ideological level of the Party organization, closely link with the workers, and gradually break the administrative working methods that we have been accustomed to for a long time.

Second, we should create conditions so that the broad masses can establish close ties with the Party organization. To this end, we must break the current style of turning grassroots organizations into organs and isolating them from the masses. There are two ways to do this. One is that all Party members in the factory should do mass work and care about the lives of the masses. Caring about solving the immediate problems of the masses should be one of the contents of the mass work of every Party member. Once, in a Sino-Soviet joint venture factory, the Soviet factory director proposed to the Party committee secretary: "The first thing the Party organization cares about in production is not machines and operating procedures, but the people engaged in production. You must maintain regular conversations with each worker, understand what they are thinking in their minds and what difficulties they have." The Party committee secretary said: "This method is very good, but the superior has not sent me so many cadres who are separated from production." The Soviet comrade replied well, he said: "According to my understanding, the Party is not composed of a few staff members who are separated from production, but is composed of all Party members. Therefore, Party work should not only be entrusted to a few staff members, but more importantly, it should be entrusted to all Party members. In this way, you will suddenly increase hundreds of cadres." This is reasonable. Only by turning caring about the lives of the masses and raising the ideological awareness of the masses into the Party's regular work can the Party closely link with the masses. The second method is that the Party organization should closely link with the non-Party masses. The place where the Party committee or branch secretary works should be the center of political leadership in the minds of the masses. If the masses have doubts and problems, they should find Party members to solve them. If they cannot be solved, they should find the responsible comrades of the Party organization to solve them. The branch secretary and the Party committee secretary should personally talk to the workers and solve the problems. One of the working methods of the Soviet enterprise Party workers I know is to answer and solve problems for the masses. In the office of the Party committee secretary, there are often many people waiting to talk to the secretary. One person comes in and asks him: "What books should I refer to when studying the Shilov drilling method?"; another asks: "When talking about 'the moral character of young people', what classic statements should I quote from Lenin and Stalin?"; some come to complain that the factory director's criticism of him is not in line with the facts, and after venting a burst of complaints, he figured it out and walked away; some come to talk about personal life, etc. This Party worker received the workers one by one, patiently educated them, and actually helped them solve their problems. In this way, as long as the workers have problems that cannot be solved, they will say: "Go to the Party organization." Many of our factory Party organizations and workers' organizations have not yet established this kind of relationship. As a Party worker said: "Now just arranging work and holding meetings fill up the time. Such work cannot be put on the work plan." Most of the responsible comrades of our factory Party organizations have not established a system of regularly meeting with workers to this day. Workers can only express their opinions at group meetings, and the content of many group meetings is limited to the scope prescribed. This is not enough. We should give workers an opportunity to tell the Party what is in their hearts. Through these works, the Party organization can correctly understand the thoughts and emotions of the workers.

Third, we should pay more attention to working with a part of the more backward workers. The Party and the trade union should understand the reasons for the backwardness of some workers and systematically eliminate the roots of backward ideas. Some Party organizations simply pay attention to cultivating and supporting labor models, and look for labor models to do everything, isolating labor models from the entire working class. This practice is wrong. The Party's political work should rely on and improve the entire working class, and correctly apply the collectivist principle of advanced driving backward to carry out the work. It is wrong to regard backward people as unchangeable "dead backward" and not care about them. It is even more wrong to use satire and attack to deal with backward workers. If the Party organization does not change the backward state, it is actually pushing them to the fortune-telling physiognomists. The more powerful the Party's work is, the fewer backward people there will be. All backward phenomena should be seen as the result of weak political work. Eliminating backwardness is an urgent task of the Party organization. The Party organization should more carefully care about the workers' work and study, thoughts and lives, and gradually improve their level of awareness.

    企业党组织要关心工人群众的思想和生活
    本报记者　安岗
    一、政治工作应当结合群众思想实际
    不少工厂党组织的政治工作存在着一种反常的现象，一方面是政治活动多，它的集中表现就是大会和小会，工人的业余时间差不多都被各式各样的会议所占去，有的工厂党委书记说：“就这样，行政、工会、青年团大家还争时间，嫌不够呢？”另一方面是真正需要政治工作的地方，反倒成了“空白点”。譬如工厂开了动员竞赛的大会和小会，可是在完成任务最紧张最困难的班或组中，却没有人在那里具体地组织竞赛，也没有人进行鼓动；又如，党组织、行政、工会、青年团都在抢那个从下午四点半到七点钟的工人业余时间，可是却没有人到工人宿舍利用工人晚上时间组织能够吸引职工参加的政治文化活动。难怪职工们常认为：这种政治工作就是只讲大道理，不解决具体问题。政治工作应该不应该讲大道理呢？完全应该。我们讲了党的总路线的大道理，工人不就是把社会主义觉悟提高一步了吗？大道理不但要讲而且还要多讲，不讲清大道理就说不明小道理。我们政治工作的毛病不是因为多讲了大道理。问题在于我们讲的科学道理太少了，而且讲大道理时没有同工人生产和生活中的具体问题相结合，没有按照大道理的精神去解决他们的一些切身问题。
  　为什么会产生这种现象呢？
    这是因为工厂党组织中有些同志还不会结合实际去作政治工作。他们以为政治工作就是照本说教。我曾经看到一位支部书记给工人讲农业社会主义改造，他是看着书本讲的。工人们瞪着眼听不懂，但他也没有办法。其实，这个讲题是很有意思的，工人们很愿意多知道一些有关农民的事，可惜的是这位支部书记忘记了他在讲演前应当作的准备工作。譬如他可以向家在农村的工人了解一些农村实际生活情况，了解工人对农业合作化有些什么看法，然后把党的政策同这些实际情况和具体问题结合起来去讲，这样工人听了就会觉得亲切了。更重要的是支部书记忘记了他讲话的对象是工人，应当多讲一些发展重工业（包括本厂的产品）对农业合作化的关系，讲到工人阶级对农民兄弟的责任等，这会使工人很快地接受党的政策并提高生产情绪。
    由此可见，党的政治工作的力量就在于把党的方针、政策和实际情况相结合。
    什么是实际？有些人对这个问题有个狭隘的看法，他们以为，只有生产才是实际，因而把政治工作结合实际仅仅看作是动员生产。毫无疑问，政治工作同生产结合是完全正确的。工厂一切政治工作的最终目的都是为了提高劳动生产率，劳动生产率的提高是我们建设社会主义社会的决定条件。可是，我们应该认识，进行生产的却是人，人在提高劳动生产率的过程中起着决定作用。人在生产过程中有各式各样的思想，还不仅仅如此，人必须生活、学习，而在生活、学习过程中，又有各式各样的思想，这都是党的政治思想工作的对象。党的政治思想工作既要解决人在生产过程中的思想问题，又要解决人在生活、学习过程中的思想问题。只有这样，党的政治思想工作才是多方面、丰富和具有吸引力的；只有这样，党的政治思想工作才是真正紧密地结合了实际。
    二、从一件事看关心群众生活问题的严重意义
    工人的思想和工人的生活又是密切联系着的。因此如果党的组织不去了解、研究和解决工人的生活问题，也就等于放弃了政治思想工作。
    我举一个例子来说明这个问题的严重性。
    在一个星期天，我曾到沈阳市的北市场，这是一个群众活动的场所。星期日有些工厂或工地放假了，很多工人到这里来游玩。在一条热闹的小巷里，我看到了十几个算卦的摊子，有的是单设一间“相馆”，有的是在街道上放上桌子，有的摆了地摊。引起我注意的是，每个摊上都不断有人算卦和听卦。其中有不少是工人，有些人看得出是基本建设单位的工人，有些还戴着工厂的证章。
    这些工人有着各自不同的切身问题，其中有婚姻问题，家庭纠纷，工作岗位选择等等。这些问题看起来都是一些个人的小事，可是这一些小事积成了工人生活的一面，如果党组织不能正确而细心地帮助工人解决这方面的问题，他们也就只好花钱向“算命的相士”去请教。
    算命的听着工人向他讲的“心事”，瞅住了每个人的弱点，从思想上来进行攻击。他的武器就是用神秘外衣遮盖起来的反动的宿命观点。这种宿命观点正是有利于剥削阶级思想的进攻的。它抓住工人思想上的弱点和生活上的困难进攻的结果，可以使觉悟不高的工人不相信自己的力量，不相信工人阶级能够掌握自己的命运，甚至怀疑起党和政府的政策来。这种散布宿命观点的相士，同歌颂封建宣扬色情的娱乐场所，同租阅黄色书刊画报的小书摊，同“自由市场”（有的工人白天上班睡觉，夜间到车站作小买卖）等等结合起来，就是我们好多人不加警惕的、但每时每刻都在向我们侵蚀的剥削阶级的思想意识的来源。这种反动的落后的思想影响通过觉悟不高和意志薄弱的工人就带到了工人阶级队伍中来，带到生产岗位上来，这就是工人违犯劳动纪律，违法乱纪等等的思想根源之一。因此，如果我们不从关心和解决工人群众切身的思想和生活问题入手，我们即使个别地处理了一些违法乱纪和违犯劳动纪律的事件，其结果，还是不能从根本上纯洁工人阶级队伍的。
    当然，这并不是说，我们党组织一旦加强自己的政治思想工作，一旦关心工人的切身问题，像上述落后现象就会马上消除，也不是说上述落后现象证明我们党组织就根本没有进行政治思想工作。因为工人阶级觉悟的提高是我们党进行长期的政治思想教育的结果。但是，只关心工人的生产，不关心工人的思想和生活问题是目前企业党组织工作中的带普遍性的严重弱点，这种弱点给相士们散布宿命论造成了更大的市场是肯定的，我在上面所说的工人寻找相士算命的现象和这种弱点有联系，也是无可否认的。
    三、怎样才能加强政治工作并同工人切身问题结合呢？
    最基本的是党的组织要关心工人生活，关心他们的思想动向。要在工人思想觉悟不断提高的基础上使政治工作深入人心。要使每一个普通工人包括工人中的落后部分在内都能从日常生活中亲切地感到党的关怀，都能把自己所想到和所感到的事情，不仅是生产上的，包括个人思想上生活上的问题、困难、希望向党倾诉，要党给他指导、帮助和解决。党组织要关心每个工人的生产成绩，同时还要关怀他的切身问题。
    把政治工作同工人切身问题结合就一定能够收效。我可以举一个具体事实来说明这条经验的正确性。旅顺某工厂一个翻砂车间工人忽然连出两次废品，车间干部都说：“这个人连出废品应该处罚”，支部书记说：“先不要处罚，我去批评他”。苏联专家听到了连忙就问支部书记：
    “你知道他为什么接连出废品？”
    “因为他工作不小心，麻痹大意。”支部书记回答。
    “你可曾弄清楚，他为什么麻痹大意？”
    支部书记回答不出来，苏联专家说：“党组织的工作人员不能根据表面的印象就批评人，你应当去实际了解他工作粗心大意的原因，如果他有具体困难就要帮助他解决困难，如果出废品完全是由于他劳动纪律松懈，再批评他也不晚。”
    这个支部书记就到工人家庭去作调查，一看原来这个工人的妻子病倒在床上，小孩子没有人照管，因为他心中不安就出了废品。支部书记向厂长提出把他妻子送到医院去治病，把孩子也安顿了，同时要他安心生产。这个工人受到党的关怀和教育，深刻地认识到过去出废品的错误。从此，他不但不再出废品而且大大提高了劳动生产率。
    党组织要关怀着每一个工人的切身问题，在解决工人切身问题的同时，向工人进行生动的政治工作。每一个具体问题的解决，都可以把工人思想大大向前推进一步，结果也就必然会使广大工人更加关心和爱护党和国家的事业，提高生产的积极性和创造性。为要作到这一点，必须注意解决以下几个问题：
    第一、要树立关心工人群众生活的思想。应当纠正部分同志中流行的一种错误看法，即认为关心工人群众生活就会在政治上作工人群众的尾巴，就会助长工人只关心自己生活福利的自私自利的思想。在这种错误思想支配下，这些同志天天只是要工人完成任务，而不去注意工人的技术、政治学习问题，衣食住行的问题，工资和奖励问题，疾病卫生问题等。其实他们不了解，社会主义制度下个人利益和公共利益的统一性，我们不只是应该教育工人群众懂得个人利益必须服从公共利益的道理，而且也应该看到工人群众从公共利益和个人利益的统一上来关心自己的劳动成果和劳动生产率的提高，正是推动工人群众热爱劳动和改进生产的力量，取消了这一点，就抹杀了社会主义竞赛的可能性和必要性，就抹杀了个人利益和公共利益的结合，就窒息了工人群众劳动热情的不断的增长，因而也就必然阻碍了生产的发展。而工厂党组织绝不能把工人群众的切身问题当作是一些繁琐的小事。也许这些事情本身确是微不足道的，但应当认识到，这些小事既然提到党组织面前，它就成了原则性的问题，就必须按照党的政策原则，观点、方法来解决。有些党组织的负责干部由于思想水平较低还不能这样作。可是，不这样作又怎么能行呢。工厂党和行政方面的工作同志今天很有必要重新温习毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文所作的指示：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”企业党组织应当用这种态度来对待工人群众，我们学会了这种群众工作方法，就会提高党组织的思想水平，密切同工人群众的联系，逐渐打破那种我们久已习惯了的行政工作方法。
    第二、应当创造条件，使广大群众能够同党组织建立亲密联系。为此，必须打破目前基层组织机关化，同群众隔绝的作风。办法有两个，一个是工厂全体党员都应作群众工作，关心群众生活。关心解决群众切身问题应当是每个党员群众工作的内容之一。曾经有一次，在一个中苏合营的工厂里，苏联厂长曾向党委书记提出：“党组织关心生产的第一件事不是机器和操作规程，而是从事生产的人，你们要保持同每个工人经常谈话，了解他们的脑子在想什么和有什么困难。”党委书记说：“这个办法很好，可是，上级没有给我派这么多的脱离生产的干部呀。”苏联同志回答的好，他说：“按照我的了解，党并不是由少数脱离生产的工作人员构成的，而是由全体党员组成的，因此党的工作不但要委托少数工作人员去作，更重要的是委托全体党员来作，这样，你就会一下子增加了几百个干部。”这是有道理的，只有把关心群众生活提高群众思想觉悟，变成全党经常性的工作，才能使党密切同群众的联系。第二个办法是党的组织要密切同非党群众联系，党委或支部书记工作的地方应当是群众心目中的政治领导中心。群众有了疑难和问题就找党员去解决，解决不了就找党组织的负责同志去解决，支部书记和党委书记应当亲自同工人谈话，解决问题。我了解的苏联企业党工作人员的工作方法之一就是给群众解答和解决问题，在党委书记办公室常常有不少人等着同书记谈话，一会儿进来一个人问他：“研究希洛夫钻眼法要参考什么书”；又一个问：“讲‘青年的道德品质’要引列宁斯大林的那些经典语句”；有的来申诉厂长对他的责备不合乎事实，发了一顿牢骚，最后想开了大踏步走去；有的来谈个人生活等。这位党的工作人员一一接待了工人，耐心地教育并实际地帮助他们解决问题。这样，工人只要有了解决不了的问题就说：“找党组织去”，我们许多工厂党组织和工人群众组织还没有建立这种关系。正如一位党的工作者所说：“现在光布置工作、开会就把时间挤满了，这样的工作提不到工作计划上。”我们大部分工厂党组织负责同志到今天没有建立经常接见工人的制度，工人只能在小组会上发表意见，而且很多小组会的讨论内容只限于规定的范围。这是不够的。应当给工人一个机会去向党说出他的心里话。党组织通过这些工作可以正确了解工人群众的思想、情绪。
    第三、更多地注意对一部分比较落后的工人进行工作。党和工会要了解某些工人落后的原因，有步骤地消除落后思想的根源。有些党组织只是单纯注意培养和扶植劳动模范，干什么都是找劳动模范，把劳动模范从整个工人队伍中孤立起来，这种作法是错误的。党的政治工作应当是依靠和提高整个工人阶级，正确运用先进带动落后的集体主义原则来进行工作。那种把落后的人看作是一成不变的“死落后”，因而不去管他们的作法是错误的。对落后的工人采取讽刺和打击的办法更是不应该的。党组织不去改变落后的状态，实际上就是把他们推给算命的相士。党的工作越有力量，落后的人就越少。一切落后现象都应看作是政治工作薄弱的结果。消除落后是党组织的迫切任务。党组织要更细心地关怀工人群众的工作和学习，思想和生活，逐步提高他们的觉悟程度。
