Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: As of the 25th, the number of people nationwide participating in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has reached 355,567,5907. This figure exceeds the 340 million signatures gathered in 1951 for the appeal to the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. Currently, the signature campaign is continuing to deepen in the vast rural areas across the country.

From the 22nd to the 25th, the number of participants in the signature campaign in rural areas of Hebei, Shaanxi, Anhui, Shandong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Fujian, Rehe, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Henan, Jiangsu and other provinces accounted for more than 60% to 70% of the total agricultural population of each province. In the Guanzhong Plain area of Shaanxi Province, known for its abundant grain and cotton production over the years, the Dabie Mountain area, an old revolutionary base in Anhui Province, the heartland of the Yellow River flooded area in Henan Province, and some areas in Yunnan, Hunan, Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces, the number of participants in the signature campaign has accounted for about 80% of the total local agricultural population.

Members of collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives across the country participated most widely in the signature campaign. All the members of more than ten collective farms in Heilongjiang Province have signed. After signing, the members of Tuanshanzi Collective Farm in Ning'an County also stated: This year, the entire farm will strive to increase grain production by 400,000 catties compared to last year and reclaim 80 hectares of wasteland. When carrying out the signature campaign, Yinma River Collective Farm in Jiutai County, Jilin Province, held eight discussion meetings and symposiums on the opposition to the use of atomic weapons, denounced the heinous conspiracy of US imperialism, and formulated a production increase plan for the farm. Ronghe Township in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, a township known for its agricultural cooperation, held a week-long signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in late February. The fourteen agricultural cooperatives in the township mobilized the surrounding farmers to hold symposiums, women's meetings, and field meetings in the evenings and during production gaps to carry out propaganda and collect signatures. More than 2,500 people signed in one week. After signing, the members of the nine agricultural cooperatives in Yuzhangzi Village, Chengde County, Rehe Province, have formulated plans to develop diverse mountain production this year based on the characteristics of their village, which has many mountains and forests.

The people in the old revolutionary base areas enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign. More than 3.58 million people in the Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong Province have signed. All of the more than 120 military families and martyrs' families in Chengkou County, an old revolutionary base area on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, have signed. In Beituo Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, where 800 people were massacred by Japanese invaders in one instance during the War of Resistance Against Japan, 946 people have signed. The people of Zhoujiazhuang Village in Jin County, which has a glorious history of the anti-Japanese struggle, are now fully cooperativized and use tractors and other agricultural machinery supplied by the state for production, achieving bumper harvests year after year. All members of the agricultural production cooperatives in this village have signed.

The signature campaign in Xinjiang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang, Gansu, Hunan and other provinces has deepened into the agricultural areas of various ethnic minorities, remote mountain villages and vast grasslands. In the Tex grassland within the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Province, 75% of the herdsmen of various ethnic groups have signed. Tian, a 106-year-old Miao woman from the Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County, Guizhou Province, brought her entire family of more than 20 people, spanning four generations, to the signature station to sign. Many farmers of Miao, Yao, Dong and other ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of western and southern Hunan Province signed their names and then crossed mountains and ridges to collect signatures from relatives and friends living in remote mountain valleys.

Fishermen in the coastal fishing areas and islands of Zhejiang Province have also actively participated in the signature campaign. The number of signatures in Shenjiamen and Mayi Island in the Zhoushan Islands accounted for more than 75% of the population. The people of Shenjiamen also held a demonstration march with more than 8,000 people participating against the use of atomic weapons.
