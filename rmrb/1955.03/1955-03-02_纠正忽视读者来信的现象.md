Correcting the Phenomenon of Neglecting Readers' Letters
Xu Dui

In recent years, many newspaper editorial departments have paid more attention to the work of readers' letters. Due to the emphasis and strengthening of readers' letters work, the editorial departments have received more and more letters, and the connection between the broad masses and the Party's and people's newspapers has become closer. Miner Xia Yunsheng said in a letter to the People's Daily editorial department:

When I feel an uncontrollable joy in my heart, when I suffer unreasonable treatment, or when I have problems that cannot be solved, or difficulties that I don’t know how to overcome, I think of the Party newspaper, and I want to write to the Party newspaper. Because I believe that the Party newspaper cares about the people, and I need the guidance and support of the Party newspaper.

This letter expresses the trust and demands of the broad masses of people, especially the working people, towards our Party.

However, the masses' trust and demands towards the Party newspaper have not yet aroused the universal attention of all Party newspaper staff today. Therefore, their attitudes towards the work of the masses' letters also differ. In December 1954, the People's Daily editorial department received a letter from reader Zhang Bingshen, who, based on his personal experience, put forward pertinent opinions and sharp criticisms on the different attitudes of some newspaper editorial departments in handling letters from readers. His letter reads as follows:

Currently, many newspaper editorial departments handle readers' letters and contributions in three ways:

First, they are enthusiastic about readers' letters and therefore handle them conscientiously and responsibly.

Second, their attitude towards readers' letters and contributions is relatively cold, and their handling methods mostly adopt a formalistic and perfunctory approach. If you often write letters and contributions to the newspaper, you will often receive such replies: "The contribution is too disorganized and will not be used. We are returning your great work." Or "The contribution has been received, and after research, it cannot be published and will be kept for reference by this newspaper." ... Some newspaper editorial departments have come up with even more ingenious methods. They summarize the handling methods into 1, 2, 3, 4 ... and print them on paper, and when replying to readers, they only mark a "×" on a certain item. How much effort this saves!

Third, and more seriously, they adopt an attitude of ignoring readers' letters. No matter how many letters you send, if they are not published, they will all be "no reply and no return." Some editors of the Shanxi Daily treat readers in this way. I have written to the Shanxi Daily five or six times, and I have received the same treatment: "No reply and no return." I sent a letter to inquire once, but the editorial department of the newspaper still ignored it.

What are the readers' reactions to the above-mentioned practices of the editorial department in handling letters? Please continue reading Zhang Bingshen's letter:

Without a doubt, the first method is the most popular among readers. But today, only a small number of editorial departments and a small number of editors are able to handle letters and contributions conscientiously and responsibly.

The second method is the most common at present, but it is unpopular among readers and even makes readers feel a headache when they see it. Readers have such opinions: "Are you (the editorial department) really so busy that you can't even write a relatively detailed letter? Does the Party and the people lack manpower to such an extent to run a newspaper?" Strangely, this practice, which is unpopular among the broad masses of readers, is precisely the one that most newspaper editorial departments are willing to adopt. It should be pointed out that this phenomenon is by no means solely due to the shortage of staff in the newspaper editorial department, but more importantly, it is due to the fact that these editors do not pay attention to the work of readers' letters. They believe that readers' letters are not worth studying carefully. They look at them in a cursory manner and naturally cannot put forward pertinent opinions, and as a result, they can only write a simple reply like a "receipt."

Readers have the biggest opinions on the third method. Many readers have great enthusiasm and hope when contacting the editorial department, but the newspaper editor does not even reply with a single word. Although this phenomenon is not universal, it is not isolated either. I believe that the practice of "no return and no reply" to readers' letters is an aristocratic attitude, and it should not be adopted by our people's newspaper. If we continue to do so, whether you are conscious or unconscious, it will inevitably lead to the danger of the Party newspaper becoming increasingly detached from the masses.

This opinion is correct, as can be proved by the letters from readers criticizing the improper handling of letters by various newspapers, which are frequently published in the internal publications of many newspaper editorial departments. Of course, there are also difficulties in practical work. This is mainly because many newspaper editorial departments currently lack manpower and the quality of cadres is not high. In addition, there is a lack of systematic and mature experience in handling readers' letters, the content of readers' letters is both broad and complex, and the number of letters increases from time to time. In the case of heavy tasks and weak cadres, some shortcomings and errors in the work are unavoidable. However, in order to rapidly improve the quality of readers' letters work and improve the professional level of cadres, we must face up to the current shortcomings in our work and strive to overcome them. Judging from the readers' opinions published in the internal publications of various newspapers, the common shortcomings of some newspaper editorial departments in handling letters work are two:

One is that some letters that should be published have not been published, and the editorial department's utilization rate of readers' letters is still very low; the other is that, as reader Zhang Bingshen pointed out, there is still a fairly common phenomenon of bureaucracy and formalism in the individual handling of letters. Bureaucracy is manifested in: procrastination, backlog, no handling results, no explanation, and even when the masses repeatedly urge, the editorial department still ignores it; formalism is manifested in: simply forwarding and replying, not solving problems, and a large number of letters failing to play a practical role under the guise of "kept for reference" or "transferred to relevant authorities for handling." Although the severity of these shortcomings varies in the editorial departments of various newspapers, the existence and development of these shortcomings will inevitably affect the connection between the Party newspaper and the people.

Why can't readers' letters be fully utilized and published in the newspaper?

As everyone knows, Lenin once taught us: "Only when there are five hundred or even five thousand non-writer staff members for every five leading and regularly writing writers, will the newspaper be lively and vigorous." ("Collection of Articles from Bolshevik Newspapers") However, some Party newspaper staff members have not truly understood this principle. They often one-sidedly emphasize the importance of active writers and neglect the role of the broad masses' letters. Some comrades are even only accustomed to relying on Party and government leading organs to understand the situation, and are not accustomed to studying and using the vivid materials from the broad masses. Of course, it is a very important aspect for the editorial department to rely on Party and government leading organs to understand the situation, but it cannot replace the special role of people's letters. Because people's letters raise questions from the perspective of the masses, and the content of the information they reflect is also relatively broad and diverse. In order to comprehensively grasp the situation, the editorial department must combine top-down understanding with bottom-up reflection. Any phenomenon that neglects either side is detrimental to the work. As for active writers, they are only a small number of backbone members in the editorial department's mass team; any team that only has backbone members but no masses cannot play a huge combat role. In order to maintain its high level of ideology and science, the Party newspaper must absorb staff members, scholars, and experts of the Party and the state with rich experience in struggle to participate in the work of the Party newspaper. However, the practice of only paying attention to the connection with five active writers and neglecting the connection with five hundred or even five thousand ordinary people should be opposed.

Another reason why few letters are published in the newspaper is that some newspaper editorial departments have not established the principle that the entire editorial department handles letters. The experience of the Soviet "Pravda" proves that in order to publish more readers' letters, each group of the editorial department must use the materials of the letters in various forms. The issues of universal significance and principle raised in readers' letters often become the themes of "Pravda" editorials; the specific materials reflected in the letters become the most convincing arguments in editorials or special articles. As for using the materials of the letters to draw cartoons and write essays, there are even more. In 1953, 125 essays were published in "Pravda," of which more than 90 were written using the materials of the letters or the issues raised in the letters. In addition, "Pravda" also has many frequently appearing and vivid columns, which are also set up to publish more letters. Taking the column "Letters to the Editor" as an example, each department of the "Pravda" editorial department strives to publish more letters here.

Many of our newspapers are now working according to the principle that the entire editorial department handles letters. However, some newspapers are not like that. In the editorial departments of these newspapers, letters are handled by the readers' letters group, and contributions are handled by other groups of the editorial department. It should be pointed out that it is very unscientific to mechanically distinguish letters and contributions from the writing form and handle them separately by different groups. In this way, many useful opinions and materials will be dispersed as a result, losing their value for publication; sometimes, different groups are working on the same issue, which wastes manpower; at the same time, there is also a tendency for the phenomenon of repeated reports in the "Readers' Letters" column and other pages to appear on the newspaper. According to the experience of Soviet newspapers and the results of several years of exploration by some of our newspapers, letters and contributions must be handled uniformly according to the same principle, and handling these letters and contributions should be stipulated as the common task of all staff members of the editorial department. This is a necessary measure from the organizational point of view to ensure that letters are handled better and more letters are published.

The third reason why readers' letters cannot be published more is that some editorial staff members lack investigation and research and a serious and responsible working style when handling letters. In some newspaper editorial departments, there are indeed some staff members who are satisfied with revising manuscripts on the basis of manuscripts, and are unwilling to patiently conduct necessary investigations, supplements, and verifications on the basis of letters, and are unwilling to carefully conduct some analysis and research work, and raise issues of political significance and social significance from the daily life problems of the masses. Some editorial staff members even only focus on writing skills to measure the value of readers' letters. Some letters with content are often marked with the word "unnecessary" on the grounds that "the writing is not concise" or "the letter is not clear," and stored in archives or returned to readers. In this case, the possibility of readers' letters being published naturally becomes smaller and smaller.

Striving to publish more letters is only one aspect of the work of readers' letters. In fact, more than 90% of the letters need to be answered and solved by the editorial department separately. Therefore, how to do a good job in this area is also a very important issue.

However, this aspect of work is often more neglected. Some newspaper staff members believe that "the main task of the editorial department in handling readers' letters is to serve the newspaper, not to serve individual readers."

Obviously, this is a one-sided view. The editorial department's emphasis on the work of readers' letters is not only to obtain materials that can be published, but more importantly, to listen to the opinions of the masses and give play to the masses' supervisory role over the work of the Party and the state. Lenin once regarded workers' letters as a barometer of political climate. Many of our comrades who work in newspapers also have such practical experience. Looking at the letters received by the People's Daily every day, letters of criticism, suggestions, complaints, and accusations account for about one-third of the total number of letters. Although the issues raised in these letters are often closely related to the readers' own interests, they expose deviations or problems in the implementation of the Party and government's policies by individual regions and individual cadres. It is not possible or necessary to publish all of these letters in the newspaper, but the editorial department's conscientious handling of these issues will give play to the supervisory role of the people—the masters of the country—over the work, and will improve the masses' political enthusiasm and enthusiasm. For the newspaper editorial department, we conscientiously serve the readers and handle the readers' problems. The readers will use their own experiences to expand the political prestige of the Party newspaper among the masses by word of mouth, attracting more masses to connect with the Party newspaper and participate in the work of the Party newspaper. Isn't this natural?

Some Party newspaper staff members also believe that the issues reflected in readers' letters are "small matters" and are not worth paying attention to. It is true that the content of some readers' letters is indeed small matters that are not closely related to the work of the Party and the state. In dealing with this part of the letters, the editorial department should, on the one hand, have an attitude of not rejecting small matters; on the other hand, it should educate readers on how to deal with these small matters. However, some small matters may either develop into big matters, or have social significance in themselves, and are not as "small" as some comrades think. The People's Daily receives several letters every day suggesting the recycling of waste products: some suggest recycling empty toothpaste tubes, some suggest recycling scrap steel, and some suggest recycling waste paper and rags. They say that in the early stage of national industrialization, we should make full use of all available materials. Can we say that these letters are "small matters" that are not worth paying attention to? No. Why did these things, which no one would pay attention to before liberation, attract people's general attention today? This is because the people's socialist consciousness has been raised, and it is a concrete manifestation of the people's concern for the country's socialist construction. The responsibility of the Party newspaper staff is to encourage the masses' enthusiasm for socialist construction and raise the masses' socialist consciousness. If we regard these letters as "small matters" and do not pay attention to them, or even put them in archives and ignore them, it will dampen the masses' enthusiasm for caring about the country's construction cause, which will be a serious political loss. The People's Daily also received a letter from a student. The student said in the letter that a farmer asked him what the purpose of his life was, and he could not answer correctly, and asked the editorial department to help him solve it. Can we say that this is a "small matter"? No. Solving this problem for this student will not only help him establish a correct outlook on life, but will also help more people establish a correct outlook on life through him. The above are just a few examples. From this, it can be seen that if the editorial staff can identify problems with the correct stand and viewpoint, they can strengthen the political and ideological content of the letters work.

In some newspaper editorial departments, there are also people who believe that the issues required to be resolved in the letters should be handled by other organs, so they push the readers' letters out of the way. Originally, the content of readers' letters is both broad and complex. In order to solve readers' problems more effectively and in a timely manner, it is necessary for the editorial department to transfer some letters to Party and government organs at all levels for handling. At the same time, in order to strengthen the connection between Party and government organs at all levels and the people, the editorial department can not only entrust various departments to assist in handling letters, but also has the responsibility to educate the masses, and raise some issues that should be resolved locally directly to the local competent departments, and let them be responsible for solving them, without necessarily having to raise the issues to the editorial department, because currently Party and government organs at all levels have departments or cadres to handle people's letters, and they generally pay attention to the work of people's letters. However, some newspaper editorial departments have shortcomings in this area: one shortcoming is that some comrades, under the control of the wrong idea of ​​being afraid of trouble and irresponsible, transfer some letters that should not be transferred to various organs, which reduces the Party newspaper editorial department to a letter-forwarding station. Another shortcoming is that some organs do not do enough seriously, responsibly and timely when handling the readers' letters transferred by the newspaper, and some newspaper editorial departments lack the necessary inspection and supervision system, and even lack the courage to fight against bureaucracy, resulting in the failure of some letters to fully play the practical role of promoting work.

In order to make more use of readers' letters in the newspaper, and at the same time improve the individual handling of letters, various thoughts of newspaper staff that neglect readers' letters and incorrect attitudes towards letters should obviously be corrected. But it must be emphasized that the key to improving the work of readers' letters lies in strengthening the leadership of the editorial department over the work of letters. The editor-in-chief and the editorial board of the newspaper should regard the work of letters as one of the most important tasks of the editorial department, and should stipulate that handling letters is an important task of all staff members of the editorial department; they should pay attention to improving the ideological level and policy level of the editorial staff, so that they have a style of close contact with the masses and the ability to handle letters correctly, and at the same time, they should be good at using readers' letters to promote work in all aspects. Only in this way can we further do a good job in the work of readers' letters, so as to further consolidate the connection between the newspaper and the masses, enrich the content of the newspaper, and improve the ideological and combat effectiveness of the newspaper.

    纠正忽视读者来信的现象
    徐兑
    近几年来，许多报纸编辑部都更加重视读者来信工作了。由于重视和加强了读者来信工作，编辑部收到的来信就越来越多，广大群众同党和人民的报纸的联系也就更加密切。矿工夏芸生在给人民日报编辑部的一封信中说：
    当我内心产生了不可压制的喜悦的时候，当我遭受了不合理的待遇的时候，或者是当我有了问题不能解决，有了困难不知道怎样克服的时候，我就想起了党报，我要给党报写信。因为我相信党报是关心人民的，而我正需要党报的指导和支持。
    这封信表达了广大人民，特别是劳动人民对我们党的信赖和要求。
    但是，群众对党报的信赖和要求，在今天还没有引起全体党报工作人员的普遍重视，因此，他们在对待群众来信工作的态度上也有所不同。一九五四年十二月，人民日报编辑部收到读者张丙申的来信，他从亲身的体验中，对目前一些报纸编辑部处理来信工作的不同态度提出了中肯的意见和尖锐的批评。他的信是这样写的：
    目前许多报纸编辑部对读者来信来稿的处理，有三种情况：
    一、对读者来信是热情的，因而在处理上是认真负责的。
    二、对读者来信来稿的态度比较冷淡，在处理方法上多采取形式主义的应付的办法。如果你常给报社写信写稿，你就会经常收到这样的回信：“来稿太杂乱，不用。兹将大作退回。”或者是“来稿收到，经研究无法刊用，留作本报参考。”……有的报纸编辑部想的办法更巧妙，它们把处理办法归纳成一、二、三、四……条印在纸上，给读者复信时，只在某条上划上一个“×”号。这多省劲啊！
    三、更严重的是对读者来信采取不理睬的态度，不管你来多少信，如不刊用，一律是“不覆不退”。山西日报有些编辑人员对待读者就是这样的。我曾给山西日报写了五、六次信、稿，所受到的是同一的待遇：“不覆不退”。我去信催问了一次，该报编辑部仍然是置之不理。
    读者对以上编辑部处理来信工作的几种作法有些什么反应呢？请继续看张丙申的来信：
    毫无疑问，第一种作法是最受读者欢迎的。但是在今天，能够认真负责处理来信来稿工作的还仅仅是少数编辑部和少数编辑工作人员。
    第二种，是目前最普遍的、但却是不受读者欢迎的，甚至使读者看到就头疼的一种作法。读者都有这样的意见：“你们（编辑部）当真忙得连一封比较详细的信都不可能写吗？党和人民要办一个报纸，难道人力竟缺乏到这种程度？”奇怪的是，这种不受广大读者所欢迎的作法，却偏偏是目前大部分报纸编辑部所乐意采用的。应该指出，这种现象绝不仅仅是因为报纸编辑部人手太少，更主要的，还是由于这些编辑同志不重视读者来信工作。他们认为读者来信不值得仔细研究，走马看花地看一遍，自然提不出中肯的意见，结果就只能写个简单的像“收条”一样的复信了。
    读者对第三种作法的意见最大。许多读者在和编辑部联系时，都是抱着很大的热情和希望，而报纸编辑却连只字都不回。这种现象虽然不是普遍的，但也不是个别的。我认为对读者来信“不退不覆”的作法，是一种贵族老爷式的态度，它不应该是我们人民的报纸所应采取的。如果继续这样作下去，不管你是自觉的或不自觉的，势必使党报发生日益脱离群众的危险。
    这个意见是正确的，这从许多报纸编辑部内部刊物上经常刊载的读者批评各报处理来信不当的信件中可以得到证明。当然，实际工作中也是有困难的。这主要是目前不少报纸编辑部人力不足，且干部质量不高；再加上处理读者来信工作还缺乏系统的、成熟的经验，读者来信的内容既广泛复杂，而数量又时有增加。在任务重、干部弱的情况下，工作中的某些缺点和错误也是难免的。但为了迅速提高读者来信工作的质量，提高干部的业务水平，我们必须正视当前工作中的缺点，并努力克服它。从各报内部刊物上所刊载的读者意见看，一些报纸编辑部在处理来信工作中的共同缺点有两个：
  一个是，有些应该发表的来信没有发表，编辑部对读者来信的利用率还很低；另一个是，在个别处理信件中，正如读者张丙申所指出的，还存在着相当普遍的官僚主义和形式主义的现象。官僚主义的表现是：拖延、积压，没有处理结果、没有交代，甚至当群众一再催问时，编辑部还是置之不理；形式主义的表现是：照转、照复、不解决问题，以及大量来信在“留作参考”或“转有关机关处理”的名义下未能发挥实际作用。这些缺点在各报编辑部存在的严重程度虽有不同，但这些缺点的存在和发展，必然要影响到党报和人民群众的联系。
    为什么读者来信不能被充分利用到报纸上发表呢？
    大家知道，列宁曾经教导我们：“只有在每有五个领导的和经常写作的作家，就同时有五百个甚至五千个非作家工作人员的时候，机关报才会是活泼而有生命力的。”（“布尔什维克报刊文集”）但是有些党报工作人员并没有真正领会这个道理。他们往往片面地强调作者积极分子的重要性，而忽视广大群众来信的作用。有些同志甚至只是习惯于依靠党政领导机关了解情况，而不习惯于研究和运用来自广大群众的生动材料。当然，编辑部依靠党政领导机关了解情况，是一个十分重要的方面，但它不能代替人民来信的特殊作用。因为人民来信是从群众的角度提出问题，反映情况的内容也比较广泛和多样。为了全面地掌握情况，编辑部必须把自上而下的了解和自下而上的反映相结合，任何偏废一面的现象都是对工作不利的。至于作者积极分子，毕竟只是编辑部群众队伍中的少数骨干分子；任何队伍如果只有骨干，而没有群众，是不可能发挥巨大战斗作用的。党报为了保持它的高度思想性和科学性，必须吸收党和国家有丰富斗争经验的工作人员、学者和专家来参加党报工作。但是只重视同五个作者积极分子的联系，而忽视同五百个甚至五千个普通群众联系的做法，却是应该反对的。
    报纸上发表来信不多的另一个原因，是有些报纸编辑部没有确立全编辑部处理来信的原则。苏联
  “真理报”的经验证明，要想发表更多的读者来信，必须由编辑部各组通过各种形式利用来信的材料。读者来信中提出的带有普遍意义的、原则性的问题，往往成为“真理报”社论的主题；来信中所反映的具体材料，就成为社论或专文中最有说服力的论据。至于利用来信的材料画漫画、写小品文，这就更多了。一九五三年，“真理报”上发表了一百二十五篇小品文，其中有九十篇以上是利用来信材料或来信提出的问题写成的。此外，“真理报”还有很多经常出现的、生动的栏目，也都是为了发表更多的来信而设立的。就以“给编辑部的信”这一栏来说，“真理报”编辑部各部都争取在这里发表更多的来信。
    我们有不少报纸现在也是按照全编辑部处理来信的原则进行工作的。但是有些报纸却不是那样，在这些报纸编辑部来信由读者来信组处理，来稿则由编辑部其它组处理。应当指出，从写作形式上把来信来稿加以机械的区分，并由不同的组分别处理，这是很不科学的。这样，许多有益的意见和材料就会因此而分散，失去了发表的价值；有的时候，不同的组为了同一个问题都在进行工作，这就浪费了人力；同时，在报面上也容易出现“读者来信”栏和其他版面报道重复的现象。根据苏联报纸的经验和我们有些报纸几年来摸索的结果，来信来稿必须按照同一原则作统一处理，处理这些来信来稿应当规定为编辑部全体工作人员的共同任务。这是从组织上保证更好地处理来信、更多地发表来信的必要措施。
    读者来信不能更多发表的第三个原因，是某些编辑工作人员在处理来信时，缺乏调查研究和严肃负责的工作作风。在某些报纸编辑部里，的确有一些工作人员满足于就稿改稿，而不愿意耐心地在来信的基础上作些必要的调查、补充和对证工作，不愿意细心地作一些分析研究工作，从群众的日常生活问题中，提出有政治意义、社会意义的问题。有些编辑工作人员甚至只从写作技术着眼，来衡量读者来信的价值，一些有内容的来信，往往因为“文字不精练”、“来信交代不清楚”等理由被批上“不用”字样，存进档案柜子或退还读者了。在这种情况下，读者来信发表的可能性自然越来越小了。
    争取更多的来信发表，这只是读者来信工作的一个方面。其实，还有百分之九十以上的来信，是需要编辑部分别解答和解决问题的。因此，如何做好这一方面的工作，同样是十分重要的问题。
    但是这方面的工作往往更加被忽视。有些报纸工作人员认为：“编辑部处理读者来信的主要任务是为报纸服务，而不是为读者个人服务。”
    显然，这是一种片面的看法。编辑部重视读者来信工作，不仅是为了获得可以发表的材料，更重要的还在于倾听群众的意见，发挥群众对党和国家工作的监督作用。列宁曾把劳动者来信看作一种政治气候的晴雨表。我们许多做报纸工作的同志也有这样的实际体会。以人民日报每天收到的来信看，批评、建议、控诉和揭发性的信件约占来信总数的三分之一左右。虽然这些来信所提出的问题往往同读者有切身的利害关系，但它却暴露了个别地区、个别干部在执行党和政府的政策中有了偏差或问题。在报纸上不可能也不必要全部发表这些来信，但是编辑部认真地处理了这些问题，就会发挥人民群众——国家的主人对工作的监督作用，就会提高群众的政治积极性和热情。对报纸编辑部来说，我们认真地为读者服务，处理了读者的问题，读者就会以自身的体验，一传十、十传百地在群众中扩大党报的政治威信，吸引更多的群众同党报联系，参加党报工作，这不是很自然的吗？
    也有一些党报工作人员认为读者来信中反映的都是“小事情”，不值得重视。不错，有一部分读者来信的内容确实是同党和国家工作没有多大关系的小事情。对待这一部分来信，编辑部一方面要有不拒绝小事情的态度；另一方面要教育读者怎样处理这些小事情。但是有些小事情或者可能发展为大事情，或者本身就具有社会意义，并不如某些同志所看的那样“小”。人民日报每天都会收到几封建议废品回收的来信：有的建议回收牙膏空管，有的建议回收废钢铁，有的建议回收废纸和破布条。他们说，在国家工业化的初期，应该充分利用一切能够利用的物资。我们能够说这些来信都是不值得重视的“小事情”吗？不能。为什么这些在解放以前不会有人注意的事情，在今天引起了人们普遍的注意呢？这是人民的社会主义觉悟提高了，是人民关心国家社会主义建设的一种具体表现。党报工作人员的责任，就是要鼓舞群众对社会主义建设的热情，提高群众的社会主义觉悟。如果我们把这些来信都看作“小事”而不加重视，甚至把它放在档案柜子里而置之不理，就会打击群众关心国家建设事业的积极性，这将是严重的政治损失。人民日报还曾收到一个学生的来信。这个学生在信中说，有一个农民问他人生的目的究竟是什么，他不能正确地回答，要求编辑部帮助他解决。我们能够说这是“小事情”吗？不能。替这个学生解决了这个问题，不仅会帮助他自己树立正确的人生观，而且会通过他来帮助更多的人树立正确的人生观。以上只是几个例子，从这里可以看出：编辑工作人员如果能以正确的立场和观点来识别问题，就可以加强来信工作的政治思想内容。
    在某些报纸编辑部里，也还有这样一种人，认为来信所要求解决的问题应该由其他机关处理，于是就把读者来信推出去了事。本来，读者来信的内容既广泛又复杂，为了更有效而及时地解决读者的问题，编辑部将一部分来信转请各级党政机关处理是必要的。同时为了加强各级党政机关同人民群众的联系，编辑部不仅可以委托各部门协助处理来信，而且也有责任教育群众，把一些应该在当地解决的问题，直接向当地主管部门提出，由他们负责解决，不一定非把问题提到编辑部来，因为目前各级党政机关都设有处理人民来信的部门或干部，对人民来信工作一般也是重视的。但目前有些报纸编辑部在这方面的工作是有缺点的：一个缺点是，有些同志在怕麻烦、不负责的错误思想支配下，把一些不应该转请各机关处理的来信也转出去了，这就把党报编辑部降低到一个转信站。另一个缺点是，有些机关在处理报社转去的读者来信时，还做得不够认真负责和及时，而某些报纸编辑部又缺乏必要的检查和督促制度，更缺乏向官僚主义作斗争的勇气，结果就使得一部分来信未能充分发挥推进工作的实际作用。
    为了在报纸上更多地利用读者来信，同时改进个别处理来信的工作，报纸工作人员中各种忽视读者来信的思想和对待来信的不正确态度，显然是应该加以纠正的。但是必须强调指出，提高读者来信工作的关键，还在于编辑部对来信工作加强领导。报纸的总编辑和编辑委员会应该把来信工作看作是编辑部的最重要工作之一，应该规定处理来信是编辑部全体工作人员的一项重要任务；应该注意提高编辑部工作人员的思想水平和政策水平，使得他们具有密切联系群众的作风和正确处理来信的能力，同时要善于运用读者来信来推动各方面的工作。只有这样，才可能进一步把读者来信工作做好，从而更加巩固报纸同群众的联系，丰富报纸的内容，提高报纸的思想性和战斗力。
