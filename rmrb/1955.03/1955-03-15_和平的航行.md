    A Peaceful Voyage
    By our reporter Jin Feng
    On the morning of February 24th, a cargo ship loaded with rice seeds and salted fish slowly raised its anchor at Haimen Port on the east coast of Zhejiang.

    Young sailor Lin Yunyi was cheerfully busy at the bow of the ship. He helped the master seaman raise the anchor and reel in the steel cables. Sweat streamed down his young face. He opened his coat, revealing a blue and white striped undershirt.

    At this time, a round, bright red sun had just emerged from the sea. The cargo ship sailed towards the sun. The engine vibrated evenly and rhythmically, as if singing a lighthearted song. White seagulls glided lightly over the golden sea, and fleets of fishing boats set sail.

    Suddenly, a stream of joyful sound poured out of the ship's loudspeaker:
      "Forward, forward, forward, our ranks face the sun"...

    Lin Yunyi stood at the bow of the ship and sang aloud along with the song. He sang "Our ×× (cargo ship name) faces the sun"...

    In the wheelhouse, the stern face of the helmsman, the forty-year-old Zhuo Yongjie, also broke into a smile.

    The Party representative walked out of the wheelhouse, took a deep breath of the air, and looked at the ocean with such happy, even somewhat surprised eyes, as if he had come to the sea for the first time.

    "The weather is really good, the sun is really good!" he couldn't help but praise.

    "The first truly carefree voyage in two years!" He turned around and explained to me:

    "If you listen to the history of our ship's voyages, you won't be surprised why we are so happy to be sailing today."

    "Yijiangshan, Yijiangshan has arrived!" The people at the bow stood up.

    The ship had already left Taizhou Bay. A continuous chain of islands could be seen to the due east.

    "Those are the Dongji Islands, liberated last year," the Party representative explained.

    South of the Dongji Islands, in the southeast direction of the ship, a gray-blue mountain ridge lay on the sea. That was Yijiangshan!

    Looking further south, on the gray-green edge of the ocean, some shadows were faintly visible. "Those are the Dachen Islands!"

    The Party representative pointed and explained one by one:

    "In the past, when we passed this line, we always sailed at night. These islands were all silent and still at that time. They looked like rabid dogs were hiding on them, and you didn't know when they would jump up and bite you!

    "Now, look at them, they are all smiling and lying in the embrace of the motherland."

    The Party representative's joyful eyes were even more powerful than his words. He sighed and waved his hand in the air:

      "From Yushan in the north to Pishan in the south, our voyage can proceed unimpeded!"

    Then, he, along with the young mechanic Zhang Junjie and the middle-aged cook Zhang Liang'an, told me about the ship's three experiences.

    "June 1950," Zhang Junjie said quickly, sometimes pausing, and Zhang Liang'an would interject with a few words.

      "At that time, the ship was still a foreign merchant ship. The ship sailed from Tianjin to Shantou, loaded with a full ship of goods, including peanut oil, soybeans, soybean cake, medicine, ginseng, cloth, cigarettes, dried vegetables, vermicelli... more than a hundred kinds of goods, and the bills were more than a dozen pages long." Zhang Junjie was a tallyman at the time and remembered it very carefully.

    When the ship sailed about 30 nautical miles away from the Dachen Islands, it was chased by a gunboat of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Pistols, rifles, and carbines were all stretched out, ordering the ship to stop. More than a dozen people jumped onto the ship, first dismantled the radio, and aimed machine guns at the bridge, and robbed the cargo ship to Dachen. The bandits forced more than two hundred barrels (more than 70,000 catties) of peanut oil to be unloaded onto the gunboat, and also ordered the item of peanut oil to be crossed out on the bill.

      A year later, in July 1951, the ship sailed from Shanghai to Fuzhou, preparing to load wood. The ship was not loaded with goods, and when it sailed near the Yushan Islands, a motorized sailboat of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits came. The robbers had no goods to rob, and finally took all the crew's clothes, leather shoes, cigarettes, radios, sheets, towels, soap... all away.

    Another year later, in June 1952, the ship carried a ship of flour from Shanghai to Fuzhou, and was robbed again by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits at Baiquan Island outside Fuzhou Port.

    "They are really pirates! Complete pirates!" Zhang Liang'an spat on the ground.

      "Since 1953, this merchant ship has been transferred to the hands of the Chinese people," the Party representative continued in his special, hearty way.

    From that time on, this cargo ship began a completely different destiny, and launched a tense and unyielding struggle on the same route.

    The cargo ship mainly travels between Shanghai - Haimen, Shanghai - Wenzhou. From Shanghai, it transports fertilizer, scrap iron (for agricultural tools), sacks, kerosene... to the hands of Zhejiang farmers, and from Zhejiang it transports wood, rice, Huangyan tangerines, salted fish, alum, casings, eggs, ham, lard, charcoal and other local products to Shanghai and foreign markets in exchange for machinery and steel. At that time, the voyage was really difficult. Taking advantage of the darkness, without beacons, avoiding enemy planes and warships, sailing on the dark sea. Machine guns and artillery were erected on the ship. The peaceful cargo ship had to arm itself to fight against the harassing pirates.

    "In October 1953, we sailed south from Shipu, right in this area," the Party representative pointed to the two small islands in the distance, which were on the Maotouyang sea, at the mouth of the Baidai River, called Nanze and Beize: "We saw two gunboats flying outwards, and three motorized sailboats brushed past us closely. We knew something was wrong, and just as we were about to be on guard, the enemy opened fire. The first shot landed behind the ship, and the second hit the chimney. The ship tilted, and shards of glass shattered into the engine room. The mechanic Miao Fengzhu was wounded in the abdomen. Shrapnel also hit the foot of sailor Li Dazhi on the deck. Our artillery fired, and the enemy fled in a hurry."

    After this, merchant ships often traveled through artillery fire.

    After the liberation of Yijiangshan, Chiang Kai-shek's planes still secretly attacked them.

    On the evening of January 31, outside Qingtangzui, a Chiang Kai-shek plane secretly flew in from behind the ship, and with a "whoosh," dropped two bombs, which landed more than a hundred meters behind the ship, damaging three meters and three light bulbs. Immediately, the searchlights of the air defense units on the liberated Dongji Islands lit up, weaving a net of light to capture enemy aircraft in the sky, and strings of red and green shells pierced the sky.

    "Now, it no longer has the right to speak on the ocean here," a soldier who had been listening on the side interjected.

    It was almost noon, and the sun was high in the sky.

    We went to the deck, and I pointed to those bags of seeds and asked:

    "Where are these being transported to?"

    "They are being transported to Anhui Province for the people in the flood-stricken areas last year," the Party representative's face was very serious, and he calculated the days with his fingers: "Now, there are still more than two months before Qingming, and the people will have time to send these seeds to the fields."

    "There will definitely be enough time!" The sailor Lin Yunyi, who walked past, emphasized again.

    和平的航行
    本报记者　金凤
    二月二十四日的早晨，在浙江东海岸的海门港口，一艘装满了稻谷种籽和咸鱼的货轮，缓缓地起锚了。
    青年水手林运宜在船头上愉快地忙碌着。他帮着老师傅拉起了锚，收起了钢缆。汗水顺着他年轻的脸淌下来。他敞开外衣，露出了蓝底白条的汗衫。
    这时候，一轮红艳艳的太阳刚刚从海面上涌出来。货轮迎着太阳航行。马达均匀地、有节奏地震动着，仿佛在轻快地歌唱。白色的海鸥在金色的海面上轻盈地掠过，成队的渔船出航了。
    船上扩音器的喇叭里，突然涌出一股欢乐的音流：
      “向前，向前，向前，我们的队伍向太阳”……
    林运宜站在船头上，和着歌声大声地唱起来。他唱的是“我们的××（货轮名）向太阳”……
    驾驶室里，四十多岁的舵工卓永杰的严峻的脸上，也漾开了笑意。
    党代表走出驾驶室，用力地深深呼吸着空气，带着那样快乐的，甚至有点惊奇的眼睛看着海洋，仿佛他是第一次来到海面上。
    “天气真好，太阳真好！”他情不自禁地称赞着。
    “两年来，头一次痛痛快快地航行！”他又转过身来和我解释着：
    “你听一听我们这条船航行的历史，你就不会奇怪为什么我们今天航行，会有这么高兴的心情了。”
    “一江山，一江山到了！”船头上的人都站了起来。
    船已经出了台州湾。可以看到正东面有一片连绵的岛屿。
    “那是东矶列岛，去年解放的。”党代表解说着。
    在东矶列岛南面，船的东南方向，有一座青灰色的山岗伏在海面上。那就是一江山！
    再往南看，在海洋的灰绿色的边际线上，隐隐约约还有一些黑影。“那就是大陈岛了！”
    党代表一个个指点着，解说着：
    “过去，我们经过这一线，总是在夜里航行，这些岛屿，那时候一个个都沉默不响，看起来，就像上面躲着一只只疯狗，不知道它什么时候会跳起来咬你一口！
    “现在，你看它们，一个个眉开眼笑，躺到祖国的怀抱里来了。”
    党代表的欢欣的眼神，甚至比他的言语更有力量。他吁了一口气，手在空中一挥：
      “北起渔山，南到披山，我们的航行可以畅行无阻了！”
    接着，他和年轻机匠张俊杰、中年的厨工张良安一道，同我谈了这条船三次的经历。
    “一九五○年六月”，张俊杰说得很快，有时停顿下来，张良安就插上说几句。
      “那时这条船还是外国商船，船从天津开到汕头，装了满满一船货，有花生油、大豆、豆饼、药材、人参、布疋、香烟、干菜、粉丝……一百多种货物，帐单都开了十几张。”张俊杰那时是理货员，记得特别仔细。
    船开到离大陈岛三十多浬的时候，被蒋贼军的一条炮艇追上了，手枪、步枪、卡宾枪一齐伸过来，喝令停船，十几个人跳到船上，首先拆掉了电台，机关炮对着驾驶台，把货轮抢到大陈。匪徒们逼着把两百多桶（七万多斤）花生油一起卸到炮艇上，又叫把帐单上花生油一项抹去。
      一年以后，一九五一年的七月，船从上海开到福州，准备装运木材。船上没有装货，开到渔山列岛附近，来了蒋贼军的机帆船。强盗们无货可抢，最后把所有船员的衣服、皮鞋、香烟、收音机、床单、毛巾、肥皂……都拿光了。
    又是一年以后，一九五二年的六月，从上海载运一船面粉到福州，在福州港外的白犬岛又被蒋贼军强劫了去。
    “真是海盗！十足的海盗！”张良安往地下吐了口唾沫。
      “一九五三年起，这条商船就转到中国人民手里了。”党代表以他特有的爽朗接着讲下去。
    从那时起，这条货轮就开始了完全不同的命运，在同一条航线上展开了紧张的不屈的斗争。
    货轮主要来往于上海——海门、上海——温州之间。从上海运送肥田粉、废铁（作农具用）、麻袋、火油……到浙江农民的手里，从浙江运出木材、大米、黄岩蜜橘、咸鱼、明矾、肠衣、鸡蛋、火腿、猪油、木炭这些土特产到上海和国外市场，换取机器和钢铁。那时候，航行真是艰难的。趁着黑夜，没有灯标，回避着敌机和敌舰，在黑黝黝的海面上航行。船上架起机枪，架起大炮，和平的货轮不得不武装自己，来和骚扰的海盗作斗争。
    “一九五三年的十月，我们从石浦往南开，就在这一带。”党代表指着远处那两个小岛，那是在猫头洋海面，白带河口，名叫南泽、北泽的地方：“我们看到两个炮艇飞快地往外开去，三条机帆船紧挨着我们擦过来。我们知道不对，正要警戒，敌人开炮了。第一下落在船后，第二下打在烟囱上。船身一歪，玻璃片崩进机器舱，机匠苗峰竹的腹部受伤了。弹片又打到舱面水手李大智的脚上。我们的大炮发射了，敌人才连忙逃走。”
    在这以后，商船常常在炮火中穿行。
    一江山解放以后，蒋贼军的飞机还偷偷地袭击他们。
    一月三十一日的晚上，在青塘嘴外，一架蒋贼军的飞机偷偷地从船后飞来，“呼噜”一下，扔了两个炸弹，落在船后方一百多公尺的水里，震坏了三个电表，三个电灯泡。马上，解放了的东矶列岛上防空部队的探照灯亮了，在天空织成了捕捉敌机的光网，一串串红色、绿色的炮弹穿向天空。
    “现在，这里的海洋上是再也没有它的发言权啦”，一直在旁边听着的一位战士插进来说。
    快近中午了，太阳高高地升起在天空。
    我们走到甲板上，我指着那一袋袋的种籽问：
    “这是运到那里去的？”
    “运到安徽省给去年水灾区的老百姓的，”党代表的脸色很严肃，他用手指计算着日子：“现在，离清明还有一个多月，老百姓会来得及把这些种籽送到地里去的。”
    “一定会来得及的！”旁边走过的水手林运宜又着重地说了一句。
