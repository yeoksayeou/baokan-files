    In our country's construction plan, the agricultural production increase plan is an extremely important part. In order to complete the agricultural production increase plan, over the years, our Party and the People's Government have led the people to fight natural disasters with great force and have achieved brilliant achievements. The great flood that occurred in 1954, thanks to the Party and the People's Government leading the people in vigorously preventing floods and carrying out emergency rescues, greatly reduced the damage caused by the flood and achieved a great victory. After the flood, the production and disaster relief work carried out by the Party and the People's Government to lead the farmers in the disaster areas, and the resettlement work carried out by the state for the disaster victims, helped the disaster victims gradually restore their production capacity, and their lives were initially guaranteed. However, due to the severity of last year's flood, which was rare in a century, although we overcame the flood, the damage caused to farmers was still not small. The farmers' draught animals and agricultural implements suffered considerable losses during the flood period. In addition, the cold wave and heavy snow in November and December last year caused the dike restoration and plugging projects and sideline production activities in the disaster areas to be suspended for a time, which added new difficulties to the spring plowing and sowing in the disaster areas. These situations warn us that we must pay close attention to this year's spring famine issue, further mobilize, and do a series of work from all aspects to complete the spring plowing and sowing tasks in the disaster areas, and to continue to work hard to overcome the spring famine and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.
    Experience in fighting famine over the years has proved that doing a good job in agricultural production is the fundamental way to lead disaster victims through famine. In the past, most disaster areas were able to ensure a bumper harvest of winter crops and wheat crops and fundamentally overcome the spring famine because they mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out winter plowing and sowing in the winter, strengthened field management, grasped the topdressing, watering, and weeding of winter crops in the spring, and planted more minor spring crops. However, some disaster areas focused on sideline occupations and relaxed agriculture, and some disaster victims even abandoned their land and specialized in sideline occupations, resulting in the failure to complete the sowing plan for winter crops, and failing to pay attention to field management of the sown wheat, resulting in reduced wheat harvest, the spring famine was not curbed, and the summer famine continued, causing great difficulties for the disaster victims. Accepting this lesson, if we want to fundamentally overcome the spring famine now, we must first focus on agricultural production. Therefore, we must closely integrate the work of leading disaster relief in the disaster areas with the work of leading agricultural production, and they cannot be separated.
    At present, spring agricultural production will enter a tense stage, and we must use all means to ensure that spring agricultural production is carried out well. This requires us to quickly seize the opportunity and work hard to solve the many difficulties faced by farmers in the disaster areas in spring plowing and production. The lack of draught animals is a major difficulty in this year's spring plowing. All localities should quickly implement the plans for purchasing and transferring cattle that have already been determined, and strive not to delay spring plowing. If there are few cattle and they are weak, and the burden of cultivation is heavy, diseases and deaths may occur in the spring. All localities should strive to strengthen the education of farmers on animal protection, specifically help the masses solve difficulties such as cattle sheds and feed, and make preparations for epidemic prevention and medical treatment. For the problem of lack of agricultural implements, local handicraft cooperatives should be organized as much as possible to manufacture and repair them, so that they can be solved locally. Seeds of spring crops that are lacking in the disaster areas should be allocated in a timely manner. In some areas, it is necessary to carry out dike restoration and drainage work, and more serious organization, leadership and assistance should be given. Various crops in the flood-stricken areas are cultivated roughly and have suffered from freezing damage. This spring, we must also pay special attention to strengthening field management, and timely organize weeding, topdressing, watering, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests; at the same time, we must use idle land gaps to plant more early-maturing crops and vegetables to compensate for the losses of various crops.
    But this does not mean that sideline production in the disaster areas is insignificant. On the contrary, under the premise of not affecting agricultural production, vigorously organizing the labor force in the disaster areas, especially organizing semi-labor force and women to engage in various sideline productions with raw materials and sales channels, is not only of practical significance to solving the current difficulties of the disaster victims, but also enables the disaster victims to accumulate strength to support and expand agricultural reproduction. Since last winter, the sideline income of disaster victims in Hebei Province has reached more than 920 billion yuan (old currency), which can solve 64% of the grain shortage of disaster victims in the province. In Henan Province, 30% to 40% of the disaster-stricken households have completely overcome the difficulty of grain shortage through sideline production. These are obvious examples. Some places only have general calls for sideline production, without carrying out detailed organizational work, so that the difficulties of the disaster victims cannot be solved, and the idea of simply relying on government relief has been generated, which is wrong. These places should overcome this phenomenon and earnestly strengthen specific leadership over sideline production.
    Correctly implementing the policy of organizing to help oneself through production is an important link in overcoming the spring famine. Experience in various places has proved that organizing can carry out appropriate allocation of labor force, more effectively ensure that dike restoration projects and agriculture and sideline occupations can be taken care of at the same time, make up for the shortage of labor force in agricultural production, and overcome the difficulties of lack of funds and technology in sideline production. For example, the Longhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baima Township, Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, allocated 30 laborers to specialize in sideline occupations and 55 laborers to specialize in agriculture, which not only solved the difficulties of all members of the cooperative, but also made the cooperative's wheat field management, manure accumulation, and rapeseed planting in winter very good. The whole cooperative also bought 76 new piglets for raising and accumulating fertilizer. According to existing experience, various temporary mutual aid and cooperation can also play a certain role, so they should be vigorously promoted. In order to enable the disaster victims to rely on collective strength to overcome the spring famine, all localities should seize all opportunities, use various specific examples to carry out socialist and collectivist education to the members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and the general masses, so that they can fully use the power of organization to realize the plan of helping themselves through production, and at the same time, through helping themselves through production, the mutual aid and cooperation organizations can be further consolidated and developed, which is not only beneficial to the current disaster relief work, but also of great significance to future agricultural production. Therefore, all disaster areas should pay full attention to this issue.
    Since the spring, the number of grain-deficient households has increased, and now is the critical moment of production throughout the year, so we should vigorously do a good job in relief work before the summer harvest. The state has now allocated huge amounts of relief funds, and all localities should "line up" at all levels and distribute them in a timely manner, so that these relief funds can play the greatest role in supporting production.
    Due to the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sales, it is unlikely that unscrupulous merchants will hoard and speculate on the opportunity of disaster and exploit the disaster victims. This is an extremely favorable condition for production and disaster relief work, but it also increases the responsibility of state-owned economic departments. Commercial departments and cooperatives should attach great importance to the supply of means of production and means of livelihood for disaster victims, especially the supply of draught animals, feed, agricultural implements, seeds, and fertilizers, which must be solved quickly. At the same time, attention should be paid to supplying raw materials for sideline production to disaster victims, vigorously purchasing sideline products, and providing specific guidance to sideline production through methods such as signing contracts, so that it meets the needs of the state and the market. In the unified grain sales work, we must ensure the supply of necessary rations to disaster victims. Banks should issue loans in a timely manner. Health departments should organize medical personnel to go to the disaster areas according to different situations to protect the health of disaster victims.
    At present, there are many tasks in the disaster areas, and spring plowing production is becoming increasingly tense. Party committees and governments at all levels should carefully arrange the various tasks in the disaster areas so that they revolve around production and disaster relief work. The production and disaster relief work in some counties is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and sometimes squeezed out by other tasks, which is not allowed and should be checked and corrected immediately. In lightly affected areas and poor mountainous areas, attention should also be paid to solving the various difficulties of poor households, and preventing the aggravation and prolongation of the spring famine due to complacency.
    The leading organs and the people in many regions of our country have rich experience in overcoming disasters. Now we should fully use this experience, according to the local specific conditions and the various basic policies and policies, pool our wisdom and efforts, make persistent efforts, and strive to overcome the spring famine and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

    努力战胜春荒，争取农业丰收
    在我们国家的建设计划中，农业增产计划是一个极为重要的部分。为了完成农业的增产计划，历年来，我们的党和人民政府曾领导人民用很大的力量向自然灾害进行斗争，取得了辉煌的成就。一九五四年发生的大水灾，由于党和人民政府领导人民大力防汛抢险的结果，大大减轻了洪水的灾害，取得了伟大的胜利。大水过后，党和人民政府领导灾区农民所进行的生产救灾工作，国家对灾民所进行的安置工作，帮助灾民逐渐恢复了生产能力，生活得到初步保障。但是，由于去年洪水之大为百年来所少有，虽然我们战胜了洪水，而洪水给农民造成的灾害仍然是不小的，农民的耕畜、农具在洪水期间都受到相当损失，加以去年十一、十二月间寒潮大雪的侵袭，使灾区复堤堵口工程和副业生产活动一度停顿，这就给灾区的春耕春种增加了新的困难。这些情况警告我们：必须密切注意今年的春荒问题，进一步动员起来，从各方面作好一系列的工作，为完成灾区的春耕春种任务，为战胜春荒、争取今年的农业丰收而继续努力。
    多年来同灾荒作斗争的经验证明，搞好农业生产是领导灾民渡过灾荒的根本办法。过去大部灾区就是由于在冬季发动群众大力进行冬耕冬种，加强田间管理，在春季抓紧冬种作物的追肥、浇水、锄草，并多种小春作物，因而能够保证冬种作物和小麦作物的丰收，从根本上战胜春荒。而有的灾区因为偏重副业、放松农业，甚至有的灾民荒芜土地、专搞副业，以致冬种作物播种计划没有完成，对已播种的小麦又不注意田间管理，结果麦收减产，春荒没有被遏止，夏荒连续而来，给灾民造成很大困难。接受这种教训，现在要想从根本上战胜春荒，就必须首先从农业生产上着眼。因此我们必须把在灾区领导救灾工作，同领导农业生产紧密地结合在一起，不可分割。
    目前春季农业生产将进入紧张阶段，我们必须用一切办法保证作好春季农业生产工作。这就要求我们迅速抓紧时机，努力解决灾区农民在春耕生产上的许多困难问题。缺乏耕畜是今年春耕中一个很大的困难，各地应该把已经定出的购买和调剂耕牛计划迅速付诸实施，力争不误春耕。牛少体弱，耕作负担又重，春季可能发生疾病死亡现象，各地应该努力加强对农民的保畜教育，具体帮助群众解决牛栏、饲料等困难，并预作防疫医疗准备。对于缺乏农具的问题，应当尽可能组织当地手工业合作社制造和修补，作到就地解决。对于灾区缺乏的春种作物种籽，应该及时调拨。有些地区需要进行复堤和排水的工作，更应该给予认真的组织领导和协助。水灾区的各种作物耕作粗糙，又遭冻害，今春还必须特别注意加强田间管理，及时组织锄草、追肥、浇水、防治病虫害；同时要利用闲田地隙，多种早熟作物和蔬菜，以弥补各种作物的损失。
    但这并不是说灾区的副业生产无足轻重，相反的，在不影响农业生产的前提下，大力组织灾区的劳动力，特别是组织半劳动力和妇女从事多种多样的有原料有销路的副业生产，这不仅对解决灾民当前的困难有现实意义，而且也可以使灾民积蓄力量，支持和扩大农业再生产。河北省去年冬季以来，灾民的副业收入即达九千二百多亿元（旧币），可解决全省灾民缺粮的百分之六十四。河南省有百分之三十到四十的受灾户，已经通过副业生产全部克服了缺粮困难。这都是明显的例子。有的地方对副业生产只有一般的号召，没有进行细密的组织工作，致使灾民的困难无法解决，产生了单纯依赖政府救济的思想，这是不对的。这些地方应该克服这种现象，认真加强对副业生产的具体领导。
    正确地贯彻组织起来生产自救的方针，是克服春荒的重要环节。各地经验证明，组织起来能够进行劳动力的适当调配，更有效地使复堤工程和农业、副业能够同时兼顾，在农业生产中弥补劳动力的不足，在副业生产中克服缺乏资金和技术的困难。例如江苏省江浦县白马乡龙华农业生产合作社分配了三十个劳动力专搞副业，五十五个劳动力专搞农业，不但解决了全体社员的困难问题，而且使社里的麦田管理、积肥、种油菜等冬季生产都搞得很好，全社还新买了七十六头小猪饲养积肥。根据已有的经验，各种临时性的互助合作，也都能发挥一定的作用，因此应该大力提倡。为了使灾民能够依靠集体力量战胜春荒，各地应该抓紧一切机会，用各种具体事例，向互助合作组织中的成员和一般群众，进行社会主义和集体主义的教育，使他们能够充分运用组织起来的力量，实现生产自救的计划，同时通过生产自救使互助合作组织得到进一步的巩固和发展，这不仅对当前救灾工作有利，而且对今后的农业生产也有重要的意义。因此各个灾区应该充分注意这个问题。
    春季以来，缺粮户有所增加，而目前正是全年生产的紧要关头，因此我们应该大力做好夏收以前的救济工作。国家现在已经拨下巨额救济款，各地应当层层“排队”，及时发放，使这些救济款在支持生产中发挥最大的效用。
    由于统购统销政策的实施，奸商借灾荒机会囤积居奇、盘剥灾民的事情已经很少可能了，这对生产救灾工作是一个极为有利的条件，但同时也加重了国营经济部门的责任。商业部门和合作社等应该高度重视灾民生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，目前特别是耕畜、饲料、农具、种籽、肥料的供应问题，必须迅速解决。同时要注意供应灾民副业生产的原料，大力收购副业产品，并通过订立合同等办法，对副业生产加以具体指导，使它符合国家和市场的需要。在粮食统销工作中要切实保证供应灾民以必要的口粮。银行应当适时地发放贷款。卫生部门应当根据不同情况，组织医务人员到灾区去，保护灾民的健康。
    目前灾区工作任务繁多，春耕生产日趋紧张，各级党委和政府应当对灾区的各项工作仔细加以安排，使它们围绕生产救灾工作进行。有一些县的生产救灾工作时紧时松，有时被其他任务挤掉，这是不能容许的，应该立即检查纠正。在轻灾区和贫瘠山区，也应该注意解决贫苦户的各种困难，防止因麻痹大意而加重和延长春荒。
    我国许多地区的领导机关和人民群众都有战胜灾荒的丰富经验，现在应该充分运用这些经验，根据当地具体情况和各项基本的方针政策，群策群力，再接再厉，为战胜春荒、争取今年农业丰收而奋斗。
