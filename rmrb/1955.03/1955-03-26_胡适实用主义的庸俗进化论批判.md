    Critique of Hu Shi's Pragmatist Vulgar Evolutionism
    Ai Siqi
  I. Pragmatism: "Selling Dog Meat Under a Sheep's Head"
    Hu Shi claimed that pragmatism was a product of the scientific theory of evolution and an application of its achievements in philosophy. This was one of his disguises to deceive people. Pragmatism masquerades as a subjective idealist philosophy that is consistent with the scientific viewpoint of evolutionary theory, and promotes the idea of using the principles of evolution to explain human society, thought, and life. Therefore, when we criticize pragmatism and point out its absurd essence of subjective idealism, we must also expose the mask it created by borrowing the name of biological evolution.
    We know that although humans are also a kind of organism, and the emergence of humans is the result of animal evolution, the development process of human society and human life cannot be simply explained by the laws of biological evolution. From the very beginning, humans have had essential differences from general organisms. Humans can manufacture tools and engage in production. In the production process, certain production relations suitable for the development of productive forces are formed between people. The unity of productive forces and production relations, that is, the mode of production, is the condition of social material life that determines the face and nature of society. With the forward development of productive forces, production relations will also change accordingly. With the change of production relations, all social relations, the social superstructure, and social consciousness will also change accordingly. All these laws of development and change do not exist in the lives of animals or any other organisms, but only in human social life. Therefore, although humans evolved from animals, they are essentially different from animals or any other organisms. Human social life has its own special essence and special laws, and cannot be simply reduced to the laws of biological evolution. Pragmatists are subjective idealists. They fundamentally deny the objective laws of the development of things, and of course also obliterate the laws of development of human social life, but pretend that they can use the theory of biological evolution to explain human thought and life. In fact, when pragmatists do this, they distort both human social life and the theory of biological evolution. They hang the sheep's head of "biological evolution," but actually steal and sell the dog meat of "vulgar evolutionism." The main content of this "vulgar evolutionism" is: distorting human life into a blind "coping behavior," distorting the development of things into "bit by bit evolution" and a combination of a bunch of accidental events, simply viewing society as a continuation and accumulation of individual life, and deriving from these fallacies a disguised religious superstitious viewpoint.
  II. Pragmatism Distorts Both Evolution and Human Social Life
    Pragmatists call human life and experience "coping behaviors," and regard knowledge, thought, and truth as merely "tools for coping with the environment," insisting that this is the application of the scientific principles of adaptation to the environment in the biological world. It is easy to see how pragmatists arbitrarily distort human knowledge and human life here. We know that human understanding is a reflection of objective reality, scientific knowledge reflects the internal laws of the development of objective things, and humans who master correct theoretical knowledge and scientific truth can foresee the future of the development of surrounding events, can make their practical actions purposeful and conscious, and can make their practical struggles—production activities, revolutionary struggles, etc.—invincible. This purposeful and conscious action of mankind is fundamentally different from the life of animals. Marx, in "Capital," used the difference between the construction of nests by bees and the construction of houses by architects as an example to illustrate this essential difference between animal life and human action. He pointed out that no matter how exquisitely the bee's nest is built, "what makes the worst architect superior to the most skilled bee is that the architect has already constructed it in his mind before building the beehive with beeswax" ("Capital," Volume 1, Part 3, Chapter 5). Of course, this purposeful and conscious activity of people cannot be completely subjective and arbitrary. First, there are the objective laws of nature and society, and second, people must understand these laws before they can use this knowledge of laws to make correct, purposeful, and conscious actions. If a person's actions violate this principle, and they do not recognize the objective laws of nature or society, but act arbitrarily based on subjective interests, desires, or various fictional ideas, they will make mistakes, and they will run into snags, which is called subjectivism and blindness of action. Hu Shi and his ilk of pragmatists—subjective idealists deny the existence of objective things and their laws, and deny that human understanding is a reflection of objective things and their laws, and regard human knowledge as "tools for coping with the environment," which is to lead people to the wrong path of blind action based on subjective delusion. It is also untenable for pragmatists to insist that this absurd view is an application of the theory of biological adaptation to the environment. This absurd statement only reflects the decadence and reactionary nature of pragmatists' own thoughts and lives, and can only serve as a satire on the thoughts and behaviors of themselves and the reactionaries they support! The laws of historical development dictate that all reactionaries will perish. They dare not recognize it positively, so they dare not admit the objective laws of surrounding events. All they can do is blind, dying struggles. Therefore, they need to seek any "tools for coping with the environment" that can help them prolong their lives, and pragmatists calculate for them, saying that "experience," "knowledge," etc. can be used as such tools, so they fabricated a set of subjective idealist fallacies that deny objective laws of knowledge under such a purpose. But if their set of thoughts and behaviors are compared with animals, then perhaps even animals will be wronged. The survival movement of animals adapting to the environment is to change the nature of their organisms to adapt to certain objective conditions in nature, that is, to spontaneously follow certain objective laws of development. The activity of biological adaptation to the environment will never contain the subjective idealist delusions of pragmatists, and will never have the attempt to regard "reality" as a "very obedient girl" that can be arbitrarily "painted" and "dressed up." But when pragmatists talk about "coping with the environment," they hold extreme arrogant subjective idealist illusions. Pragmatists steal the concept of "adaptation to the environment" from the theory of biological evolution as their signboard, and want to use this to "dress up" their various adventurous activities and fabricated lies as "scientific" things. In reality, the laws of biological evolution adapting to the environment and the subjective fantasies of pragmatists "coping with the environment" are fundamentally irrelevant.
  III. Not "Bit by Bit Evolution," But From Gradual Evolution to Fundamental Change
    In class antagonistic societies, the fundamental transformation of social systems, the process of the elimination of old production relations and the generation of new production relations, must go through class struggle, and the revolutionary eruption movement of the revolutionary class overthrowing the reactionary ruling class from below because the reactionary class uses the power of political rule and various superstructure forces to consolidate the old production relations and hinder the fundamental transformation of the social system. Therefore, the development process of human society completely conforms to the laws of dialectics. The development of productive forces leads to the transformation of production relations, the gradual changes within a social system lead to the fundamental change of the social system, and the daily evolutionary movement leads to the outbreak of revolution. All these changes and development processes are realized through the movement of contradictions, through the struggle between old and new things, and through class struggle. The victory of the Chinese revolution eloquently proves this truth.
    Pragmatists distort human life into the accumulation of random behaviors of individual "coping with the environment," and then obliterate the objective laws of the above-mentioned social development, obliterate the dialectical process of social systems entering fundamental qualitative changes from gradual changes, of evolutionary movements moving towards the outbreak of revolution, and obliterate the contradictory movement of class struggle and the struggle between old and new things. Based on such an anti-scientific ideological foundation, Hu Shi spread his so-called reformist fallacies of "bit by bit evolution," "bit by bit transformation," and "not admitting fundamental solutions," and insisted on pretending that these fallacies were scientific evolutionary ideas, and used them as a signboard to oppose Marxist dialectical materialism. Of course, Marxism does not oppose reform under any circumstances. Certain reform measures under revolutionary policies, such as measures to improve people's lives under the premise of the War of Resistance Against Japan, are also considered necessary by Marxists. However, Hu Shi's reformism of "bit by bit transformation" is completely reactionary. People know that Hu Shi's notorious fallacy was spread shortly after the May Fourth Movement, when the Chinese people began to accept Marxist-Leninist thought, and when the movement of the Chinese people against imperialism and the feudal rule of the Northern Warlords was rising. And the spearhead of his fallacies has always been directed against Marxism and the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements of the people in politics. In 1919, his "Study More Problems and Talk Less About -isms" was directly based on this vulgar evolutionary viewpoint to oppose Marxism and the revolutionary movement of the masses of the people in politics. History has long proved that in the extremely brutal and corrupt rule of the reactionaries in old China, it was impossible to advance history without carrying out revolutionary struggles. Under such circumstances, verbally talking about bit-by-bit evolution and opposing fundamental solutions actually meant not wanting any real solutions at all, and actually meant not wanting any progress at all. All of Hu Shi's own actions are enough to prove the reactionary and hypocritical nature of this vulgar evolutionary thought. The reformist political propositions put forward by Hu Shi on these vulgar evolutionary viewpoints were nothing more than calling on the people not to engage in class struggle, not to touch the reactionary rule, but only to beg the reactionary rulers for "bit by bit" reforms, and the result was to hand over their own destiny to the reactionary rulers to be slaughtered, which was to abolish and oppose the people's revolutionary struggle.
    The development of the people's revolutionary movement in old China did not in fact advance according to Hu Shi's formula, but according to Marxist dialectical materialism. Therefore, the main form of the actual movement was not "bit by bit transformation," but vigorous worker movements and mass struggles, which soon developed into the people's revolutionary armed struggle. In the face of the revolutionary momentum of the people, Hu Shi was afraid that relying solely on slogans such as "bit by bit transformation" would easily lead to bankruptcy, so he sometimes pretended to use the word "revolution" in some articles. In the "Introduction" to his "History of Vernacular Literature" and in "Which Road Do We Take" written in 1930, he even talked about that there can be two ways to solve problems, namely revolutionary and "evolutionary." And even pretended that he also agreed with the "revolutionary" road. However, what is Hu Shi's so-called "revolution"? Before promoting that he also agreed with "revolution," Hu Shi first played a set of sophistry on the word "revolution," obliterating the essential difference between "revolution" and "evolution." Hu Shi said: "Revolution and evolution only have a difference in degree," "Revolution and evolution are inherently relative," "Revolution often contains a little more conscious effort, while historical evolution is often an unconscious natural change." In this way, the objective and essential difference between "evolution" and "revolution," that is, the former is a gradual change, while the latter is a fundamental change, the former belongs to the category of quantitative change, while the latter belongs to the category of qualitative change, such an essential difference is obliterated by pragmatists. In Hu Shi's writing, the difference between the two is seen as merely a subjective thing: "Revolution" is nothing more than "containing a little more conscious effort." Such a "revolution" is still only "bit by bit evolution" in essence. What is terrible about talking about "revolution" in this way? It is just "containing a little more conscious effort." It does not contain the meaning of "fundamental solution"! Hu Shi played such a set of sophistry, explaining the term "revolution" into a word that no longer had any danger to pragmatists and reactionaries. Then, he had the courage to call himself a promoter of "conscious revolution," and opposed "violent revolution" in the name of "conscious revolution," that is, opposed the real revolution of the broad masses of the people led by the working class.
    The process of change and development of human society can never be unilaterally attributed to the process of "bit by bit evolution" and "bit by bit transformation" that does not include "fundamental solutions." To say that "bit by bit evolution" and "bit by bit transformation" are the application of the scientific theory of evolution, and are applied to human society, is even more ridiculous. Human social history contains the movement of class struggle, while the evolutionary process of the biological world does not have this form of movement, so to explain the development and change of human society with the laws of biological evolution, one first makes a fundamental mistake. At the same time, biological evolution is not only bit by bit. The change of biological species is essentially still a qualitative leap, still a fundamental change. Although this leap in the biological world mainly takes the form of gradual transition, the form of gradual elimination of old qualities and gradual accumulation of new qualities, it also undergoes the process of quantitative change to qualitative change. Therefore, the pragmatist's view of "bit by bit evolution" distorts both social life and the laws of biological evolution. It is not a truly scientific evolutionary viewpoint, but only a fallacy of vulgar evolutionism.
  IV. Not Randomness Dominates Everything, But Necessary Laws Run Through the Process of Development of Things
    The vulgar evolutionary viewpoint spread by Hu Shi has another fundamentally different characteristic from the truly scientific theory of evolution. This is that the scientific theory of evolution proves that the movement and development of the biological world has certain necessary objective laws, while the pragmatist's view of "bit by bit evolution" sees development as a random combination of a large pile of events without any order. The absurdity of this accidental theory of pragmatism is particularly evident when Hu Shi talks about the role of individuals. Hu Shi has extremely exaggerated the role of individual accidental behavior, wanting to use this to cancel the necessary laws of historical development. He said: A person "spitting a mouthful of phlegm on the ground may destroy a village or a clan. He has an idea, which may cause decades of bloody battles. He may 'with one word make a country prosper, or with one word make a country perish.' Good is also immortal, and evil is also immortal; it is immortal to make great contributions to the world, and it is also immortal to plant a load of grain, and it is also immortal to drink a glass of wine and spit a mouthful of phlegm" (see "Introducing My Own Thoughts"). From this passage of Hu Shi, it can be clearly seen that the pragmatist's viewpoint of "bit by bit evolution" not only obliterates the law of quantitative change to qualitative change, from gradual evolution to fundamental change in the development process, but also denies any necessary laws running through the development process of objective things, and sees randomness as the thing that dominates everything. The reactionary political viewpoint of "only recognizing the progress made bit by bit" and "not admitting fundamental solutions" is closely related to this nonsense of accidental worship theory. Since we cannot find any necessary laws running through the development process of objective things in our lives, but only a vast sea of accidental events gathered together, then we cannot have any scientific knowledge about the objective laws of the development of surrounding events, and it is impossible to try to make any predictions about the development trends of surrounding events, that is, it is impossible to rely on any knowledge of the laws of development of things to prescribe clear guidelines for our actions. In this way, what other way can we have besides engaging in blind speculative adventurous activities based on the "bit by bit" of current events? If this is the case, then the fundamental solution of social problems is of course out of the question. And all "isms" and "theories" that advocate fundamentally solving social problems can only become abstract nouns without content. Pragmatists rely on vulgar evolutionism to fabricate reasons to oppose people's revolution in this way. It is easy to understand that this anti-scientific viewpoint of accidental worship is also a manifestation of a kind of subjective idealism—agnosticism. Subjective idealism denies the objective reality of the material world and its laws of development, so it cannot but regard all things and their changes as accidental. At the same time, when all things and their changes in the world are regarded as the accumulation of randomness, it can in turn defend agnosticism—subjective idealism, since all things and phenomena are accidental, then any hope for people's scientific research on the laws of objective things will be in vain. Science becomes superfluous! People only have the road to speculate and take risks relying on purely subjective will and wishes, and to blindly "cope with the environment"! In this way, pragmatists rely on vulgar evolutionism to try to lure people to the anti-scientific road. This kind of idealist arrogant nonsense cannot withstand serious refutation. Both scientific research and revolutionary practice can fully prove that although countless accidental factors exist in the development process of objective things, and constantly give various influences to the development process, the influence of accidental factors cannot play a decisive role in the direction of the development process. The thing that dominates the development process is ultimately the necessary law. Randomness is only a supplement to necessity in the development process, as a form of expression of necessity. It either gives some obstacles to the necessary law, or gives some impetus, but necessity always opens its own path through countless accidental things. For example, the development of human social history has certain necessary laws. The people must win and the reactionaries must fail is one of the laws that play a dominant role in the current development process of human society. In front of such a historical necessary law, as far as the pragmatists and reactionaries are concerned, not to mention that spitting a mouthful of phlegm and drinking a glass of wine will not have any "immortal" effect, even Hu Shi, who has used his lifelong strength to help the reactionaries deceive the people and oppose the revolution, will still be crushed by the revolutionary people because it violates the necessary laws of the development of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution. Even some ideological toxic effects that are still left behind will eventually be completely cleared by the people. The pragmatist's accidental worship theory is only reflecting the desperate psychology of the reactionaries who are approaching extinction and hoping to rely on some accidental miracle to survive.
  V. "Social Immortality"—Individualist Religion, A Disguised Idea of the Immortality of the Soul
    Here, it is also necessary to further analyze the reactionary nature of Hu Shi's accidental worship theory. What reason does Hu Shi use to exaggerate the accidental role of individuals? This exaggeration is not based on any scientific theory of evolution, but on the foundation of subjective idealist distortion of human social life. The main point of this distortion is to deny that society is a social economic structure based on certain material living conditions, and to see society as merely an expansion of the individual, as merely an expansion of "me." Individuals are called "small self" by Hu Shi, while the entire human society is called "big self" by Hu Shi. The "big self" is the simple continuity and accumulation of the activities of countless "small selves." "All kinds of past 'small selves,' and all kinds of present 'small selves,' and all kinds of future endless 'small selves,' are passed down from generation to generation, adding a little to a drop, passing on from line to line, continuously; one water flows, endlessly:—this is a 'big self.'" Why does Hu Shi say that any accidental behavior of an individual is "immortal"? It is because he sees society as a simple continuity and accumulation of individual lives. Hu Shi said: "'Small self' is mortal, but 'big self' is immortal forever. Although 'small self' will die, everything that every 'small self' does, all merits and demerits, all words and deeds, whether large or small, whether right or wrong, whether good or bad, will all be forever left in that 'big self.'" Hu Shi calls this set of nonsense "social immortality."
    This so-called "social immortality" includes the following meanings:
    First, saying that society, the "big self," is a simple continuity and accumulation of individuals, the "small self," which is to regard the individual, the "small self," as the foundation of human society, and to regard individual actions as the determining force of historical development, which is to distort social life with the subjective formula of bourgeois individualism. This is a common and already old-fashioned viewpoint of all bourgeois social and historical theories. Hu Shi—the pragmatist is vainly attempting to spread this old-fashioned bourgeois viewpoint under the signboard of the concept of "social immortality," to oppose the scientific socialist thought of Marxism-Leninism. The actual significance of "social immortality," which is based on such an old-fashioned viewpoint, lies in seeing society as being forever composed according to the principles of individualism, in regarding individualism as a matter of course, and in wanting to make people believe that all people are the same "me." Since they are all the same "me," the working class does not need to draw a line with the bourgeoisie, the working people do not need to draw a line with the exploiting class, and there is no need for class struggle and the struggle between new and old ideas that reflect class struggle. Whether it is a society ruled by the bourgeoisie or any reactionary party, it is just a "big self," which is forever "immortal." The fundamental transformation of society or the elimination of the capitalist system is unthinkable. Therefore, "social immortality" is actually the immortal concept of capitalism and the class exploitation system. Marxism has long thoroughly refuted this bourgeois historical view, pointing out that human society is not a simple collection of individuals. The material foundation of society, the conditions of social material life that determine the nature and face of society, are production and the mode of production. There is nothing "immortal" or permanently unchanged. Human social history is constantly changing, and the productive forces of human society are constantly developing forward. It is an inevitable law that social systems develop from lower stages to higher stages. The demise of the capitalist social system and the victory of the socialist social system are also inevitable laws. All old systems and ideas that hinder development and hinder progress must decay and be eliminated in the class struggle and the struggle between new and old ideas that reflect the class struggle. The determining force that promotes the forward development of social history, the determining force that promotes the emergence of new productive forces and production relations and makes the entire social system leap from a lower stage to a higher stage, is the production struggle of the broad masses of the working people and the class struggle against social corrupt forces. The strength of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class is the determining force that overcomes all resistance from the exploiting classes and guarantees the victory of socialist construction. Only the production struggle of the working people and the activities of people participating in the progressive revolutionary movement can leave indelible achievements of varying sizes in the constantly developing historical process. The accidental behavior of individuals that is not related to the production struggle of the masses and the forward movement of history will not have any important role in the development of social history. Any reactionary behavior of individuals who oppose the people and oppose the historical progressive movement must also be crushed by the power of the people. Marxists do not deny a certain role of individuals. The production struggle and class struggle of every working people have a certain important significance for social progress, and outstanding figures have a major role in history that cannot be ignored. However, the reason why the actions of each working people have important significance is because they are closely related to and completely consistent with the collective struggle of the masses. The role of outstanding figures is determined by whether their actions and thoughts are in line with the laws of historical development, whether they have promoted the improvement of social productive forces and the change of social systems, and whether they can contribute to the liberation of the working people. The size of the role of outstanding figures is measured by the degree of perfection of these conditions. People who go completely against the forward movement of history in thought and action will never become truly outstanding figures in history, but will only become shameful clowns. Such people may occasionally become famous due to circumstances under the rule of the reactionaries, but will soon perish along with the failure of the social corrupt forces. The pragmatist Hu Shi himself is an example of such a clown. Therefore, Hu Shi's "social immortality" and the "concept" of "immortality" of individual accidental behavior are subjective idealist fictions that are completely irrelevant to the objective facts of human social history, and are lies fabricated to promote reactionary bourgeois individualism.
    Second, Hu Shi's "social immortality" is not only a reactionary bourgeois individualist lie, but also a lie that cunningly paves the way for religious superstition. We say that it is the most cunning because although Hu Shi actually promotes beliefism and religious thought, and even openly declares that the concept of "social immortality" is "my religion," on the surface he pretends to oppose superstition and the concept of "immortality of the soul," and even opposes the concept of the existence of God and advocates the attitude of "atheism." Hu Shi claimed that he was deeply influenced by the thought of Fan Zhen, an outstanding atheist of the Chinese Six Dynasties in his early years, and therefore denied the concept of the immortality of the soul in old religious superstition. These cunning remarks of Hu Shi have confused many naive intellectuals, thinking that he is a thorough "atheist" and supporter of the scientific worldview, and even mistakenly regarded him as a materialist. However, the superficial phenomenon of things is not necessarily directly equal to its essence. If we take Hu Shi's "social immortality" for a careful analysis, we can see that Hu Shi only used the name of the materialist Fan Zhen on the surface, pretending to oppose the concept of "immortality of the soul" and the existence of God in words, but secretly created a disguised concept of the immortality of the soul and the existence of God. The difference between it and the "old" concept of the immortality of the soul and the viewpoint of the existence of God is only that it has abandoned the old form of the feudal era and put on the new clothes of capitalism. What is "social immortality"? "Social immortality" is the immortality of the "big self." And the meaning of the so-called "immortality" of the "big self," we have analyzed in the previous section, is that the individualist bourgeois system and the class exploitation system are immortal. We know that everything in religion about the concept of the existence of God, the concept of the immortality of gods or the immortality of heaven, is nothing else but the deification and idealization of the existing social system. In the feudal society era, the system of heaven was conceived with the realistic feudal system as a model, and the images of God and gods of the feudal era were shaped according to the faces of the rulers of the feudal society. The feudal era's concepts of the existence of God, the immortality of gods, and the immortality of heaven are the deification and idealization of the feudal system and the feudal ruling class, and are a kind of "social immortality" concept of the feudal ruling class. Hu Shi denied God, gods, and heaven in words, but when he preached about the "immortality" of the "big self" and the "immortality of society," he was in fact secretly sanctifying individualists, the bourgeoisie, and the capitalist exploitation system, and secretly "dressing up" all of this as a disguised God, gods, and heaven. Hu Shi opposes the concept of the immortality of the soul in words, advocating that "small self is mortal." But when he said that all the trivial accidental behaviors of the small self—spitting a mouthful of phlegm and drinking a mouthful of wine—are "immortal," when he said that all the actions of the "small self"... whether right or wrong, whether good or bad, will all be forever left in that "big self," he was secretly spreading a disguised concept of the immortality of the soul. This is not a new method. Idealism has always created this kind of disguised soul immortality fiction: the human body is illusory, so it will die, but although the individual's body dies, his spirit will be combined with universal rationality, "absolute spirit" (that is, the disguised upper layer of idealism), etc. Hu Shi said that any "small self" will leave all his words and deeds forever in the "big self" after death, which is a reiteration of this kind of idealist fiction. Idealism wants to obliterate an objective fact with this disguised theory of the soul: that the behavior of individuals that is not related to the production struggle, class struggle, and all social progressive movements of the working people will never have any important role in the development of history, and the reactionary behavior of all people who oppose the progressive movement will be completely submerged by the torrent of the people and history. Not only that, but the old-fashioned religious superstition has this concept of "cause and effect," that if a certain ancestor accidentally did something wrong, the descendants will be punished for it. The so-called "original sin" of Christianity is also this kind of thinking. Because the ancestors of mankind accidentally stole an apple in "Paradise," all the descendants of mankind are punished by God for generations. This superstitious thought of "ancestors committing sins" is also reproduced in a disguised way on the basis of Hu Shi's concept of "social immortality." For the various disasters suffered by old China, Hu Shi used this disguised viewpoint of "cause and effect" to view them: "The suffering and shame we suffer today are all the evil consequences planted by various evil causes in the past" (see "The First Anniversary of Independent Review"). After the September 18th Incident, when the Japanese imperialists forcibly occupied our Northeast, Hu Shi, in his article "Painful Memories and Reflections" written a year later, did not seriously accuse the Japanese imperialist invasion, but turned the spearhead of condemnation against his own ancestors: "Our old ancestors committed too many sins, and the misfortune has spread to us today." Hu Shi shamelessly denied the fact that imperialism invaded China in politics, and insisted that the Chinese themselves were not competitive. This national inferiority complex of comprador is originally based on his disguised superstitious concept of "social immortality."
    Naturally, Hu Shi opposes the concept of "cause and effect" of religious superstition in words—opposing so-called "fatalism" or "determinism." In his autobiographical article "My Beliefs," he declared that he was "using accidental theory to oppose determinism." Here, Hu Shi openly admitted his anti-scientific subjective idealist viewpoint of accidental worship. However, we must now study whether "using accidental theory to oppose determinism" is really opposed to religious superstitious concepts. First of all, it should be answered that it is not the case at all. The concepts of "accidental theory" and "determinism" seem to be two extremes, but in fact they are both based on the same anti-scientific idealist foundation, that is, denying the objective law of the development process of things and the development process of human society, and denying that human beings can recognize and use the objective law of the knowledge of the development of things to transform the world and seek welfare for society. "Determinism" wants people to believe that the world is ruled by God and gods (do not forget that in the society ruled by the exploiting class, God and gods are the sanctified images shaped according to the faces of the rulers. ), people are completely ignorant and incompetent in front of God and gods, so they should willingly hand over their own destiny to them to be dominated, and in fact they are to succumb to the will of the exploiters and rulers. "Accidental theory" wants people to believe that the world is a vast sea of randomness. Here, there are no inevitable laws in the changes of all things, and people cannot find a definite direction for any things and any behaviors in this vast sea. Therefore, they can only sigh at their own ignorance and incompetence, and helplessly hand over their own destiny to the control of mysterious accidental forces, and in fact they are to be left to the control of the reactionary rulers such as the bourgeoisie and imperialists. Whether it is "determinism" or "accidental theory," it is an attack on human knowledge ability, an attack on people's fighting will and creative confidence, and it is a reactionary thought that leads to religious superstition and self-willingness to surrender. Only dialectical materialism, only recognizing that the development of things has objective and necessary laws, and recognizing that people can recognize and use these laws, is the true scientific worldview, is the infinitely sharp spiritual weapon of the working class and the broad masses of the working people in carrying out the revolutionary practice of transforming nature and transforming society, and is the philosophical ideological weapon that can truly crush all religious superstition and guide the working people to fully grasp their own destiny and future in their own hands with full confidence.

    胡适实用主义的庸俗进化论批判
    艾思奇
  一、“挂羊头卖狗肉”的实用主义
    胡适声称实用主义是科学的进化论出现以后的产物，是进化论的成果在哲学上的应用，这是他用来迷惑人们的假面具之一。实用主义把反科学的主观唯心论装扮成好像是符合于进化论学说的科学观点，标榜着用进化论的原理来解释人类社会和人类的思想和生活。所以，在我们批判实用主义，指出它的主观唯心论的荒谬本质的时候，同时还必须揭破它假借生物进化学说的名义所制成的假面具。
    我们知道，人类虽然也是一种生物，人类的出现，虽然也是动物进化的结果。但人类社会和人类生活的发展过程，决不能简单地用生物进化的规律来解释。人类从一开始就与一般生物有着本质上的区别。人类能制造工具，进行生产，在生产过程中，人和人之间形成一定的与生产力发展情况相适合的生产关系，生产力和生产关系的统一，即生产方式，是决定社会面貌和社会性质的社会物质生活条件。随着生产力的向前发展，生产关系就会跟着发生变更。随着生产关系的变更，全部的社会关系，社会的政治上层建筑和社会意识，都相应地发生变化。这一切发展变化的规律，都是动物以及任何其他生物的生活中所没有的，而仅仅存在于人类社会生活中。所以，人类虽然是由动物进化而来，但已在本质上不同于动物或其他任何的生物。人类社会生活有自己特殊的本质和特殊的规律，决不能简单地归结到生物的进化规律之内。实用主义者是主观唯心论者，他们根本否认事物发展的客观规律性，当然也抹煞了人类社会生活发展的规律性，但却又假装说可以用生物进化的学说来解释人类的思想和生活。实际上实用主义者这样做的时候，是既曲解了人类社会生活，也曲解了生物进化学说。他们挂着“生物进化论”的羊头，实际上是在偷卖“庸俗进化论”的狗肉。这种“庸俗进化论”的主要内容是：把人的生活曲解为盲目的“应付行为”，把事物的发展曲解为“一点一滴的进化”和一大堆偶然事件的凑合，把社会简单看做个人生活的连续和堆积，并从这些谬论中引导出一种变相的宗教迷信观点。
  二、实用主义既曲解了进化论，又曲解了人类社会生活
    实用主义者把人的生活、经验、叫做“应付的行为”，把知识、思想和真理等等看做仅仅是“应付环境的工具”，硬说这就是应用了生物界适应环境的科学原理。我们很容易看出实用主义者在这里是如何横蛮地曲解了人类的知识和人类的生活。我们知道，人类的认识是客观现实的反映，科学知识反映着客观事物发展的内部规律性，人类掌握了正确的理论知识，掌握了科学的真理，就能预见周围事变发展的前途，就能使自己的实践行动成为有目的有意识的自觉的行动，就能使自己的实践斗争——生产活动，革命斗争等等——战无不胜。人类这种有目的有意识的自觉行动，和动物的生活是有根本的区别的。马克思在“资本论”里，曾用蜜蜂筑巢和建筑师建筑房屋的不同作为例子，来说明动物生活和人类行动的这种本质的区别。他指出蜜蜂的巢无论筑得如何精巧，“但使最劣的建筑师都比最巧妙的蜜蜂更优越的，是建筑师以蜂蜡建筑蜂房以前，已经在他脑筋中把它构成了”（“资本论”第一卷第三篇第五章）。当然，人的这种有目的有意识的自觉活动，又不能是完全主观随意性质的。首先有自然界和社会的客观规律，其次人们要认识这些规律，然后才能够利用这些规律知识来做出正确的有目的有意识的自觉活动。如果人的行动违背了这样的原则，不去认识自然界或社会的客观规律，只凭主观的兴趣、愿望或各种虚构的想法随意行动，那就要犯错误，就要碰钉子，那就叫做主观主义和行动的盲目性。胡适一流的实用主义者——主观唯心论者否认客观事物及其规律性的存在，否认人的认识是客观事物及其规律性的反映，把人的知识看做“应付环境的工具”，这就是要把人引导到依靠主观妄想从事的盲目行动的错误道路上去。实用主义者把这种荒谬的看法硬说是生物适应环境的学说的应用，也是不通的。这种荒谬说法仅只是反映了实用主义者自己本身的思想和生活的腐朽性和反动性，只能作为对他们自己以及他们所拥护的反动派的思想和行为的一种讽刺！历史发展规律注定了一切反动派要走向灭亡，他们不敢正面认识，因此也就不敢承认周围事变的客观规律，他们所能做的事情就是盲目的垂死的挣扎。因此他们需要寻求任何可以帮助他们苟延残喘的“应付环境的工具”，而实用主义者就替他们谋算起来，说可以把“经验”、“知识”等等当成这样的工具，于是他们就在这样的目的之下捏造了一套否认客观规律知识的主观唯心论的谬论。但如果把他们的这一套思想行为拿来和动物比拟，那也许连动物也要受了委屈。动物适应环境的生存运动，是要改变自己的有机体的性质来适应自然界的一定的客观条件的变化，也就是自发地依循着一定的客观发展规律的。生物的适应环境的活动，决不会包含着实用主义者的那种主观唯心论的妄想，决不会有那种想要把“实在”当做可以任意“涂抹”和“装扮”的“很服从的女孩子”的企图。但实用主义者谈到“应付环境”的时候，却是抱着极端狂妄的主观唯心论幻想的。实用主义者把生物进化论里“适应环境”的概念偷来作为自己的招牌，想借此把自己的各种冒险活动和捏造的谎言“装扮”成
  “科学”的东西，实际上生物适应环境的进化规律和实用主义者“应付环境”的主观幻想，是根本不相干的。
  三、不是“一点一滴的进化”，而是由逐渐的进化到根本的变革
    在阶级敌对的社会里，由于反动阶级利用政治统治的力量以及各种上层建筑的力量来巩固旧的生产关系，来阻碍社会制度的根本变革，因此，社会制度的根本变革过程，旧的生产关系的消灭和新的生产关系的产生过程，必须经过阶级斗争，必须经过革命阶级由下而上地推翻反动统治阶级的革命爆发的运动。所以，人类社会的发展过程，完全是符合辩证法的规律的。由生产力的发展进到生产关系的变革，由一种社会制度内的逐渐变化进到社会制度的根本的改变，由日常的进化运动走向革命的爆发，而这一切变化发展过程，是通过矛盾运动，通过新旧事物的斗争和阶级斗争来实现的。中国革命胜利的过程，雄辩地证明了这一条真理。
    实用主义者把人类的生活曲解为一件件个人“应付环境”的随意行为的堆积，于是就抹煞了上述社会发展的客观规律，抹煞社会制度由逐渐变化进入根本的质变，由进化运动走向革命爆发的辩证过程，抹煞阶级斗争和新旧事物斗争的矛盾运动。就在这样一种反科学的思想基础上，胡适散布了他所谓的“一点一滴的进化”“一点一滴的改造”和“不承认根本的解决”的改良主义谬论，并且硬把这些谬论也假装作科学进化论思想，以此做为招牌来反对马克思主义的唯物辩证法。当然，马克思主义并不是在任何情形之下都反对改良，在革命政策之下的一定的改良措施，如在抗日战争的前提下改善人民生活的措施，马克思主义者认为也有必要的。但胡适的“一点一滴的改造”的改良主义，却是完全反动的。人们知道，胡适的这种臭名昭著的谬论，是在五四运动以后不久，中国人民开始接受了马克思列宁主义思想，中国人民反对帝国主义和北洋军阀封建统治的运动高涨起来的时候散布出来的。而他所散布的这些谬论，在政治上始终是把反对的锋芒针对着马克思主义和人民的反帝反封建运动。在一九一九年他所写的“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”，就是直接依据这种庸俗进化论观点来在政治上反对马克思主义，反对当时的人民群众的革命运动。历史早已证明，在旧中国那种极端残暴腐朽的反动派统治下面，不进行革命斗争，就不可能使历史前进，在那样的情形下面，口头上讲一点一滴的进化，反对根本的解决，就是在实际上不要任何真正的解决，就是实际上根本不要进步。胡适自己的全部行动，都足以证明这种庸俗进化论思想的反动性和虚伪性。胡适在这些庸俗进化论的观点上所提出的改良主义的政治主张，无非是叫人民不要进行阶级斗争，不要去触动反动统治，而只能向反动统治者去乞求“一点一滴”的改良，结局就是把自己的命运交给反动统治者去宰割，就是要取消和反对人民的革命斗争。
    旧中国的人民的革命运动的发展在事实上并没有依照胡适的公式前进，而是依照马克思主义的唯物辩证法前进的，所以，实际运动的主要形式不是
  “一点一滴的改造”，而是蓬蓬勃勃的工人运动和群众斗争，并且随即又发展成为人民的革命武装斗争。在人民的革命声势前面，胡适害怕单只用“一点一滴的改造”这些口号容易遭到破产，所以有时也在一些文章中假装使用一下“革命”的字眼，在他的“白话文学史”的“引子”里和一九三○年写的“我们走那条路”里，居然也谈到解决问题可以有两条道路，即革命的和“演进的”。并且甚至于假装自己也是赞成“革命”道路的。然而，什么是胡适的所谓的“革命”呢？胡适在标榜自己也赞成“革命”之前，先在“革命”这个字眼上玩弄了一套诡辩的手法，把“革命”和“演进”之间的本质的区别抹煞了。胡适说：“革命和演进只有一个程度上的差异”，“革命和演进本是相对的”，“革命往往多含一点自觉的努力，而历史演进往往多是不知不觉的自然变化”。这样一来，“演进”和“革命”的客观上的本质的区别，即前者是逐渐的变化，而后者是根本的变革，前者是属于量变的范畴，而后者是属于质变的范畴这样一个本质的区别，就被实用主义者一笔抹煞了。在胡适的笔下，两者的不同就被看成仅仅是主观的东西：“革命”不过是“多含一点自觉的努力”而已。这样的“革命”，在实质上仍然只是“一点一滴的进化”，这样来谈“革命”，有什么可怕呢？不过是“多含一点自觉的努力”而已，这里面并没有包含着“根本的解决”的意思！胡适就是玩弄了这样一套诡辩手法，把“革命”这个名词解释成对于实用主义者和反动派不再有任何危险的字眼，于是就有了胆量来把自己称为“自觉的革命”的提倡者，并在“自觉的革命”的名义下来反对“暴力革命”，即反对工人阶级领导的广大人民的真正的革命。
    人类社会的变化发展过程决不能片面地归结为不包含“根本的解决”的“一点一滴的进化”，“一点一滴的改造”的过程。说“一点一滴的进化”和“一点一滴的改造”就是科学进化论学说的应用，并且是对于人类社会的应用，这更是荒谬可笑。人类社会的历史包含着阶级斗争的运动，生物界的进化过程里则不存在这个运动形式，所以要用生物进化的规律来解释人类社会的发展变化，首先就犯了一个根本的错误。同时，生物界的进化也并不仅仅是一点一滴的，生物的种类变化在实质上仍是一种质的飞跃，仍然是一种根本的变化，虽然生物界的这种飞跃主要是采取逐步过渡的形式，采取旧质逐渐消灭和新质逐渐积累的形式，但究竟也经历着由量变到质变的过程，所以，实用主义者的“一点一滴的进化”观是既曲解了社会生活，也曲解了生物进化规律，它并不是真正科学的进化论观点，而只是庸俗进化论的谬论。
  四、不是偶然性支配一切，而是必然的规律贯串着事物发展的过程
    胡适所散布的这种庸俗进化论观点，与真正科学的进化论学说还有一个根本不同的特点。这就是科学的进化论证明了生物界的运动发展有着一定的必然的客观规律，而实用主义者的“一点一滴的进化”观，则把发展看成一大堆没有任何秩序的事件的偶然凑合。实用主义的这种偶然论的观点的荒谬性，在胡适论到个人的作用的时候，表现得特别明显。胡适曾把个人的偶然行为的作用加以极端的夸大，想借此来取消历史发展的必然规律。他说：一个人“吐一口痰在地上，也许可以毁灭一村一族。他起一个念头，也许可以引起几十年的血战。他也许‘一言可以兴邦，一言可以丧邦。’善亦不朽，恶也不朽；功盖万世固然不朽，种一担谷子也可以不朽，喝一杯酒，吐一口痰也可以不朽。”（见“介绍我自己的思想”）。从胡适的这一段话里，就很清楚地可以看到，实用主义者的“一点一滴的进化”的观点，不但抹煞了发展过程中由量变到质变，由逐渐的进化到根本的变革的规律，并且否认了任何贯串在客观事物发展过程中的必然规律，而把偶然性看做支配一切的东西。“只承认那一点一滴做到的进步”，“不承认根本解决”的反动政治观点，是和这种偶然崇拜论的胡说密切联系着的。既然我们生活中找不到任何贯串客观事物发展过程的必然规律，而只有一个偶然事件凑集起来的茫茫大海，那么，我们就不可能有任何有关周围事变的客观发展规律的科学知识，也就不可能设想要对周围事变发展的趋势作出任何的预见，也就是不可能依靠任何事物发展规律知识来给我们的行动规定明确的方针。这样一来，我们除了就“一点一滴”的眼前事件来作盲目的投机冒险活动之外，又有什么别的法子呢？如果情形真是这样，那么，社会问题的根本的解决当然就谈不上了。而一切主张根本解决社会问题的“主义”“学说”，都只能成为没有内容的抽象名词了。实用主义者就是这样依靠着庸俗进化论捏造出反对人民革命的理由。很容易明白，这种偶然性崇拜的反科学的观点，也是主观唯心论——不可知论的一种表现形式。主观唯心论否认了物质世界及其发展规律的客观实在性，就不能不把一切事物及其变化过程都看做偶然的东西。同时，把世界一切事物及其变化过程全看做偶然性的堆积时，就反过来又可以为不可知论——主观唯心论作辩护，既然一切事物现象都是偶然的，那么人们对于客观事物规律的科学研究的任何希望都要落空了。科学就成为多余的东西了！人们就仅仅只有依靠纯主观的意志和愿望来投机冒险，来盲目的“应付环境”这一条道路了！这样实用主义者又依靠着庸俗进化论想把人引诱到反科学的道路上去。这种唯心论的狂妄胡说是经不起认真的驳斥的。不论科学的研究或革命的实践都可以充分证明，在客观事物发展过程中虽然存在着无数的偶然因素，并且对发展过程不断地给与种种的影响，但偶然因素的影响，对于过程的发展方向并不能起决定作用，支配发展过程的东西究竟是必然的规律，偶然性在发展过程中只是作为必然性的补充，作为必然性的表现形式；它或者对必然规律给与若干阻碍，或者给与若干推动，但必然性总是通过了无数的偶然性而开辟着自己的道路。例如，人类社会历史的发展就有一定的必然规律，人民一定要胜利和反动派一定要失败，就是目前人类社会发展过程中起支配作用的规律之一。在这样的历史的必然规律前面，就实用主义者和反动派的情形来说，不要说他们吐一口痰喝一杯酒不会有任何“不朽”的作用，就是像胡适那样以个人毕生的力量来帮助反动派欺骗人民反对革命的活动，因为违反了中国社会和中国革命发展的必然规律，结果还是要被革命人民所粉碎，就是现在还遗留的一些思想上的有毒影响，也终归要被人民清除得一干二净的。实用主义的这种偶然崇拜论又不过是反映着接近灭亡的反动派希图依赖什么偶然奇迹来侥幸得救的那种盲目挣扎的绝望心理罢了。
  五、“社会的不朽论”——个人主义的宗教，变相的灵魂不灭思想
    在这里，还需要对于胡适的这种偶然崇拜论的反动性作一些进一步的分析。胡适用什么理由来夸大个人的偶然作用呢？这种夸大并不是建立在什么科学的进化论学说上面，而是建立在对人类社会生活的主观唯心论的曲解的基础之上的。这种曲解的主要点就在于，否认社会是在一定物质生活条件基础之上的社会经济结构，把社会看做仅仅是个人的扩大，看做仅仅是“我”的扩大。个人被胡适叫做“小我”，而全人类社会则被胡适称做“大我”。“大我”就是无数“小我”的活动的简单的连续和堆积。“种种过去的‘小我’，和种种现在的‘小我’，和种种将来无穷的‘小我’，一代传一代，一点加一滴，一线相传，连绵不断；一水奔流，滔滔不绝：——这便是一个‘大我’。”为什么胡适要说个人的任何偶然行为都是“不朽”的呢？就因为他把社会看做个人生活的简单的连续和堆积的缘故。胡适说：“‘小我’是有死的，‘大我’是永远不死，永远不朽的。‘小我’虽然会死，但每一个‘小我’的一切作为，一切功德罪过，一切语言行事，无论大小，无论是非，无论善恶，一一都永远留存在那个‘大我’之中。”胡适把这一套胡说叫做“社会的不朽论”。
    这种所谓“社会的不朽论”，包括着以下的意义：
    第一，说社会、“大我”是个人、“小我”的简单的连续和堆积，这就是把个人，“小我”当做人类社会的基础，把个人的行动当做历史发展的决定力量，就是用资产阶级的个人主义的主观公式来曲解社会生活。这是一切资产阶级的社会历史学说所共同的早已陈旧了的观点。胡适——实用主义者正是妄想在“社会的不朽”观念的招牌下面来散布这种陈旧的资产阶级观点，来反对马克思列宁主义的科学的社会主义思想的。根据这样的一种陈旧观点为基础的“社会的不朽论”，它的实际意义就是在于把社会看做永远按照个人主义的原则所组成，就是在于把个人主义看做天经地义，就是要想使人相信：一切人都是同样的“我”，既然同样是“我”，工人阶级就用不着和资产阶级划分界线，劳动人民就用不着和剥削阶级划分界线，就用不着阶级斗争和反映阶级斗争的新旧思想斗争了。不管是资产阶级统治的或任何反动派统治的社会都只是一个“大我”，都是永垂“不朽”的，社会的根本变革或资本主义制度的消灭，都是不能设想的。所以“社会的不朽论”，实际上就是资本主义，阶级剥削制度的不朽观念。马克思主义老早已彻底驳倒了这种资产阶级的历史观，指出人类社会不是简单的个人的集合。社会的物质基础，决定社会的性质和面貌的社会物质生活条件是生产、生产方式。没有“不朽”或永久不变的东西，人类社会历史不断变化，人类社会的生产力不断向前发展，社会制度由较低的阶段向较高的阶段发展，这是必然的规律，资本主义社会制度的灭亡和社会主义社会制度的胜利，这也是必然的规律。一切阻碍发展，阻碍前进的陈旧的制度和思想，是一定要朽败，一定要在阶级斗争和反映阶级斗争的新旧思想斗争中被消灭的。推动社会历史向前发展的决定力量，推动新的生产力和生产关系的产生和使整个社会制度由低级阶段向高级阶段飞跃的决定力量，是广大劳动人民的生产斗争和反对社会腐朽势力的阶级斗争，以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟的力量，就是克服一切剥削阶级的反抗，保证社会主义建设获得胜利的决定力量。只有劳动人民的生产斗争和参加在进步革命运动中的人们的活动，才能在不断发展的历史过程中留下或大或小的不可磨灭的功绩，与人民群众的生产斗争和历史的前进运动没有联系的个人的偶然的行为，对于社会历史的发展是不会发生任何重要作用的。反对人民和反对历史进步运动的任何个人的反动行为，也必然要被人民的力量所粉碎。马克思主义者不否认个人的一定的作用，每一个劳动人民的生产斗争和阶级斗争，对于社会的进步都有一定的重要意义，而杰出人物在历史上具有着不容忽视的重大作用。但是，每一个劳动人民个人行动之所以有重要意义，是因为它和群众的集体斗争密切联系和完全一致的缘故。杰出人物的作用，是决定于他们的行动和思想对于历史发展的规律是否符合一致，对于社会生产力的提高和社会制度的改变是否有所推进，对于劳动人民的解放是否能有所贡献，杰出人物的作用的大小，是以这些条件的圆满程度来衡量的。在思想上和行动上完全与历史的前进运动背道而驰的人，决不会成为历史上的真正杰出人物，而只能成为可耻的小丑，这样的人也许在反动派的统治下面由于因缘时会偶尔也会声名喧赫起来，但很快就会跟着社会腐朽势力的失败而一同归于破灭。实用主义者胡适自己就是这类小丑的一个例子。所以，胡适的“社会的不朽”和个人的偶然行为“不朽”的“观念”，是与人类社会历史的客观事实完全不相干的主观唯心论的虚构，是为着宣传反动的资产阶级个人主义而捏造出来的谎言。
    第二，胡适的“社会的不朽论”，不仅仅是反动的资产阶级个人主义的谎言，而且是用狡猾的方法为宗教迷信开辟道路的谎言。我们说它是最狡猾的，是因为虽然胡适在实际上宣传着信仰主义和宗教思想，甚至于公开地宣告“社会不朽”观念是“我的宗教”，然而在表面上却又装出一套好像在反对迷信，反对“灵魂不灭”的观念，甚至于反对上帝存在的观念和主张“无神论”的姿态。胡适自称早年曾受过中国六朝时代杰出的无神论者范缜的思想的深刻影响，因此否定了旧的宗教迷信里的灵魂不灭的观念。胡适的这一类狡猾的言论，迷惑了很多天真的知识分子，以为它真的是彻底的“无神论”者和科学世界观的拥护者，甚至于把他误认为唯物论者。然而，事情的表面现象，不一定就直接等于它的实质，如果我们把胡适的“社会的不朽论”拿来作一番仔细的分析，就能够看出胡适只是在表面上利用了唯物论者范缜的名义，在口头上装做反对“灵魂不灭”和上帝存在的观念的样子，而在暗中却偷偷地制造了一种变相的灵魂不灭观念和上帝存在的观念。它与“旧”的灵魂不灭观念和上帝存在观点的不同，仅不过是抛弃了封建时代的旧形式，穿上了资本主义的新服装吧了。什么叫做“社会的不朽”？“社会的不朽”就是“大我”的不朽。而所谓
  “大我”的不朽的意义，在前节我们已经分析过，那就是说个人主义的资产阶级制度的不朽，阶级剥削制度的不朽。我们知道，一切宗教里的关于上帝存在的观念，关于神仙不死或天堂不朽的观念，都不是别的东西，而只是现存社会制度的神化和理想化的表现。在封建社会时代，天堂的制度，就是以现实的封建制度作为模型设想出来的，封建时代的上帝、神仙之流的形象，都是按照封建社会的统治者的面貌塑造出来的。封建时代的上帝存在、神仙不死、天堂不朽的观念，就是封建制度和封建统治阶级的神化和理想化的表现，就是封建统治阶级的一种“社会的不朽”观念。胡适在口头上否认了上帝、神仙和天国，但当他进行关于“大我”的“不朽”和“社会的不朽”的说教的时候，却是在事实上把个人主义者，把资产阶级和资本主义的剥削制度偷偷地加以神圣化，偷偷地把这一切“装扮”成一种变相的上帝，神仙和天国。胡适在口头上反对灵魂不灭的观念，主张“小我是有死的”。但当他说到小我的一切细小的偶然行为——吐一口痰，喝一口酒——都“不朽”的时候，当他说“小我”的一切作为……无论是非，无论善恶，一一都永远留存在那个“大我”之中的时候，他又偷偷地在散布了一种变相的灵魂不灭的观念。这并不是什么新的手法，从来的唯心论都制造过这一类变相的灵魂不灭的虚构：人的肉体是虚幻的，所以才会死的，但个人的肉体虽然死了，他的精神却会和普遍的理性、“绝对的精神”（即唯心论的变相的上层）等合一起来，胡适说任何一个“小我”死了都会把自己的一切言行永远留在“大我”中，正是这一种唯心论虚构的改头换面的再现。唯心论用这种变相的灵魂论要想来抹煞一个客观事实：即与劳动人民的生产斗争、阶级斗争以及一切社会进步运动没有联系的个人的行为对于历史发展决不会发生任何重要作用，一切反对进步运动的人们的反动行为都要被人民和历史的洪流彻底湮没。不仅如此，旧式宗教迷信有这样一种“因果报应”的观念，某个祖宗偶然做了一件错事，就要后代子孙代受惩罚。基督教的所谓“原罪”，也就是这一类的思想，由于人类的始祖偶然偷吃了“乐园”里的一个苹果，就使全人类子孙世世遭受上帝的惩罚。这种“祖宗造孽”的迷信思想，在胡适的“社会的不朽”观念的基础上也改头换面地再现出来。对于旧中国所受的各种灾难，胡适就是用这种变相的“因果报应”的观点来看的：“我们今日所受的苦痛和耻辱，都只是过去种种恶因种下的恶果”（见“独立评论一周年”）。九一八事变之后，日本帝国主义者强占了我们的东北，胡适在一周年后所写的“惨痛的回忆与反省”一文中，不是认真地控诉日本帝国主义的侵略，却把谴责的锋芒对着自己的祖宗：“我们的老祖宗造孽太深了，祸延到我们今日”。胡适在政治上无耻地否认帝国主义侵略中国的事实，一口咬定中国人自己不争气，这种洋奴买办的民族自卑思想，原来是在他的“社会的不朽”的变相迷信观念里有着思想根据的。
    自然，胡适在口头上是反对宗教迷信的“因果报应”观念——反对所谓“宿命论”或“定命论”的。在他的自传性质的“我的信仰”一文中，他宣称自己是“以偶然论来对定命论”。在这里，胡适公开承认了他的反科学的主观唯心论的偶然崇拜的观点。但是，我们现在就要研究一下，“以偶然论来对定命论”，是不是就真的和宗教迷信观念对立起来了呢？首先应该答复说：完全不是这样一回事。“偶然论”和“定命论”这两种观念看起来好像是两个极端，实际上都建立在同一个反科学的唯心论的基础之上，这就是，否认事物发展过程和人类社会发展过程中的客观规律性，否认人类能够认识和利用事物发展的客观规律知识来改造世界和为社会谋福利这一种创造的能力。“定命论”要人们相信世界是由上帝和神灵所统治（不要忘记在剥削阶级统治的社会里，上帝和神灵，就是按照统治者的面目塑造出来的神圣化的形象。），人在上帝和神灵的前面是完全无知和无能的，因此就应该心甘情愿地把自己的命运交给他们去宰制，而实际上就是要屈从于剥削者统治者的意志。“偶然论”要人们相信世界是偶然性的茫茫大海，在这里面一切事物的变化都没有任何必然的规律，人在这茫茫大海中对于任何事物和任何行为都找不到一个确定的方向，因此也只好自叹无知无能，而无可奈何地把自己的命运交给神秘的偶然力量去支配，而实际上也就是要听凭资产阶级、帝国主义者等反动统治者去支配。不论“定命论”或“偶然论”，都是对人类的知识能力的进攻，都是对人民的战斗意志和创造信心的进攻，都是导向宗教迷信、自甘屈辱的反动思想。只有辩证唯物论，只有承认事物的发展具有着客观的必然规律，承认人们能认识和利用这些规律的辩证唯物论，才是真正的科学的世界观，才是工人阶级和广大劳动人民在进行改造自然和改造社会的革命实践斗争中的无比锐利的精神武器，才是真正能粉碎一切宗教迷信并指导劳动人民以满怀信心把自己的命运和前途完全掌握在自己手里的哲学思想武器。
