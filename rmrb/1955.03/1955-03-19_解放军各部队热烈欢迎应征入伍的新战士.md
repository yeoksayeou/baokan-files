Xinhua News Agency, March 18th—People's Liberation Army units are warmly welcoming newly enlisted soldiers.

　　Many companies in the Central and Southern Military Region have decorated their barracks as if for a festival, with welcoming slogans posted everywhere. When the new soldiers arrived at the unit's station, unit leaders and veteran soldiers rushed to the barracks to greet them; some companies' veteran soldiers even pinned a large red flower on the chest of each new comrade. Many companies held welcome evening parties, where cadres and veteran soldiers introduced the glorious history of their units and the deeds of heroes and models, encouraging the new comrades to add new glory to the unit. Recently, a unit of the East China Sea Defense Forces also welcomed a group of newly enlisted soldiers. As the ship carrying the new soldiers approached the coast of a certain place, the sound of firecrackers, gongs and drums, applause, and the cheers of "Welcome new comrades to the sea defense front, strengthen national defense!" resounded across the shore. The dance team in the welcoming line danced, and the song team sang "The Song of the Sea Defense Soldiers." The new soldiers stood excitedly on the ship, waving and applauding the veteran comrades with smiling faces, shouting "Learn from the old comrades!" After the new soldiers landed, the veteran soldiers helped them carry their backpacks and walked hand in hand into the barracks.

　　After arriving at the People's Liberation Army units, the newly enlisted soldiers excitedly wrote letters to their relatives reporting their happy mood and determination after joining the army. The new soldier Shuai Housheng wrote to his mother after arriving at the Seventh Company of a certain unit, saying: "The superiors and old comrades take such good care of us, just like brothers. Mom, please rest assured. I will definitely learn from the old comrades, work hard to improve my skills, and strive to be an excellent national defense soldier."

    解放军各部队热烈欢迎应征入伍的新战士
    【新华社十八日讯】　中国人民解放军各部队热烈欢迎应征入伍的新战士。
    中南军区的很多连队把营房打扮得像过节一样，到处张贴着欢迎新战士的标语。当新战士们到达部队驻地时，部队首长和老战士们都赶到营房外面来迎接；有些连队的老战士还给每个新战友胸前戴上一朵大红花。许多连队都举行了欢迎新战士的晚会，干部和老战士们向新战士介绍了自己连队的光荣历史和功臣、模范们的事迹，鼓励新战友为连队增加新的光荣。华东海防部队某部最近也欢迎了一批应征入伍的新战士。当载着新战士的船只靠近某地海岸时，岸上的爆竹声、锣鼓声、鼓掌声和“欢迎新战友来到海防前线，增强国防力量！”的欢呼声响成一片，欢迎行列中的舞蹈队跳着舞，歌咏队唱起了“海防战士之歌”。新战士们都兴奋地站在船上，满面笑容地向老战友们招手、鼓掌，高呼“向老同志学习！”新战士们登岸后，老战士们帮助他们背着背包，手拉手地走进了营房。
    应征服兵役的新战士到达人民解放军各部队后，兴奋地写信向亲人报告自己入伍后的愉快心情和决心。新战士帅厚生到达某部第七连后写给母亲的信上说：“上级和老同志对我们照顾得太好了，都像亲兄弟一样。妈妈，请您放心吧。我一定好好地向老同志们学习，努力提高本领，争取作一个优秀的国防战士。”
