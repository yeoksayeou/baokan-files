Emphasize Saving Hemp
Zou Zaisheng

Hemp is an important fiber crop second only to cotton. It is not only an indispensable raw material for the domestic textile industry, paper industry, and fishery production, but also an important export commodity for the country. The main hemp crops produced in China are ramie, flax, hemp, jute, kenaf, and ambary hemp.

With the development of national economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for hemp crops has grown far faster than the growth of production. For example, if the production of ramie in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 114.57 in 1951, 133.7 in 1952, 169.83 in 1953, and 168.06 in 1954. The growth of demand, taking 1950 as 100, increased to 123.52 in 1951, 177.58 in 1952, 250.03 in 1953, and reached 291.01 in 1954. The production and demand growth of other types of hemp are roughly similar.

Chinese hemp has always held a strong position in the international market. To rapidly achieve national socialist industrialization, it is necessary to appropriately increase the export volume of hemp in the future. At the same time, the construction tasks of China's first five-year plan stipulate that light industry should be developed accordingly. As one of the main raw materials for light industry production, hemp crops must also meet the needs of light industry development. However, since there is a contradiction between the arable land for general hemp crops and the land occupied by increased production of staple food, cotton, and oil crops, production will still lag behind the development of demand for a certain period. In this situation, in order to ensure the completion of the country's necessary exports and to meet the hemp material needs of the correspondingly developing domestic light industry, in addition to appropriately expanding the sown area and increasing the yield per unit area under the principle of not affecting the increase in staple food production, the main thing is to start with saving hemp.

Saving hemp can be approached from two aspects: on the one hand, improving the efficiency of the use of hemp products; on the other hand, actively utilizing substitutes. For example, in the production of cigarette paper, the hemp pulp ratio in the use of raw materials was originally 70 percent. Now, with the help of the local Finance Committee, Zhejiang Minfeng Huafeng Paper Mill has changed it to 50 percent, and it can still maintain the original product quality. This not only reduces production costs but also saves raw materials for the country. If the hemp pulp ratio of all paper production in the country is reduced to 50 percent, more than 2,000 tons of hemp can be saved annually. For example, the Hemp Rope Cooperative in Botou City, Hebei Province, uses recycled old hemp rope and waste hemp ends as raw materials, mixed with 30 percent of good hemp, and the ropes produced can completely replace new hemp ropes. The output value of waste material production by the cooperative reached 240 million yuan (old currency) by last December. Shandong State-owned Paper Mill also actively purchases old fishing nets and mixes them with good hemp to make paper, saving a lot of raw materials for the country.

There is also great potential for the adoption of hemp substitutes in China. For example, a wild hemp grows in the desert grasslands of Xinjiang and Gansu provinces. According to experiments by the East China Textile Administration, after degumming and refining, it has a bright color and its spinning performance is four times higher than that of wool cotton. When blended with cotton and wool, it can be woven into high-grade textiles such as venetian and serge. For example, the sesame produced in North China has a large output. After farmers squeeze the sesame seeds for oil, they throw away the sesame stalks or use them as firewood. If these sesame stalks are retted and peeled, the hemp fiber can be mixed with other hemp to make ropes or hemp bags. The cotton stalk skin developed in the East China region has been tested by the state-owned Zhejiang Hemp Textile Factory and can be used to make ropes and packaging cloth. When mixed half and half with jute, it can be used to weave sacks. At least four sacks can be woven from the cotton stalk skin produced per mu of cotton field. Secondly, ropes used for scaffolding in construction can be replaced with wire or straw ropes, which have the same effect as hemp ropes. In addition, kudzu vine, rush, Imperata cylindrica, and rock tripe grass can all be used to replace hemp bark for bundling small packages. Some of these substitutes have already been utilized, while others have not been valued and utilized. For example, some shops still use hemp rope for small package bundling, and many construction units are unwilling to use substitutes. Even in some areas, due to the shortage of kenaf, hemp and ramie, which have higher use and export value, are used instead, resulting in huge waste.

In addition to strengthening publicity work and implementing the spirit of saving hemp, state-owned commercial enterprises should actively organize and discover new sources of goods that can replace hemp, do a good job in purchasing, and use practical trial results to persuade hemp-using units to gradually change their past habits and save more hemp for the country.

    重视节约用麻
    邹再生
    麻是次于棉花的重要纤维作物。它不仅是国内纺织工业、造纸工业、渔业生产等不可缺少的原料，也是国家的重要出口物资。我国生产的主要麻类作物有苎麻、亚麻、大麻、黄麻、?（青）麻和洋麻等六种。
    随着国家经济建设的发展和人民生活水平的提高，对麻类作物的需要量的增长，远远超过生产增长的速度。如以一九五○年苎麻的生产量为一百，则一九五一年为一百一十四点五七，一九五二年为一百三十三点七，一九五三年为一百六十九点八三，一九五四年为一百六十八点零六。其需要的增长情况以一九五○年为一百，一九五一年则增长为一百二十三点五二，一九五二年为一百七十七点五八，一九五三年为二百五十点零三，一九五四年则达到二百九十一点零一。其他几种麻的生产和需要增长情况大约也是如此。
    我国的麻在国际市场上一向很有地位，为迅速实现国家社会主义工业化，今后必须适当增加麻的出口量；同时，我国第一个五年计划的建设任务中规定——相应地发展轻工业，作为轻工业生产主要原料之一的麻作物，也必须满足轻工业发展的需要。但因为一般麻类作物的耕地和主粮、棉花、油料等增产所占用的土地存在着矛盾，所以在一定时期内生产仍将赶不上需要的发展。在这种情况下，为了保证完成国家必要的出口，和满足国内轻工业相应地发展着的麻料需要，除在不影响主粮增产的原则下，仍应适当扩大播种面积，提高单位面积产量外，主要的是从节约用麻这方面着手。
    节约用麻又可从两方面着手：一方面是提高麻制品的使用效率；一方面是积极利用代用品。像卷烟纸的生产，在原料使用上的麻浆配比原为百分之七十，现在浙江民丰华丰造纸厂在当地财委帮助下，已改为百分之五十，并且仍能保持原产品质量。这样既降低了生产成本，又为国家节约了原料。如果全国盘纸生产都降低到百分之五十的麻浆配比，则全年可节省大麻二千多吨。又如河北省泊头市麻绳合作社，用回收旧麻绳、废麻绳头作原料，再掺上百分之三十的好麻，生产出来的绳子，完全能顶新麻绳使用。该社利用废料生产的产值至去年十二月即达旧币二亿四千多万元。山东国营造纸厂也积极收购破旧渔网掺在好麻里造纸，为国家节省不少原料。
    在我国麻的代用品的采用上，潜力也是很大的。如新疆、甘肃等省的沙漠草原地带生长一种野麻，据华东纺织管理局试验，经脱胶精炼后，色泽光亮，纺织性能比毛棉高四倍，和棉毛混纺可织成凡立丁哔叽等高级纺织品。又如华北所产的胡麻，产量很大，农民用胡麻籽榨完油以后，把麻秆却扔掉或作柴烧火用了，如果把这种胡麻秆经过沤泡剥制，其麻纤维可和其他麻混合制绳或制麻袋用。华东区所发掘的棉梗皮，经国营浙江麻纺织厂试验，可用来制成绳索和打包布，如同黄麻各半混合可以织制麻袋。每亩棉田所产的棉梗皮至少可织制四只麻袋。其次像建筑用的绑手脚架的绳子，可用铁丝或草绳代替，其效果和麻绳相同。另外像葛藤、纽草、龙须草、岩青草等都可代替麻皮捆扎小型包装。这些代用品，有的已经被利用起来了，有的还没有被重视和利用。如在很多商店的小包捆扎还有用麻绳的，许多建筑单位还不愿使用代用品。甚至有些地区，因?（青）麻不足而竟以使用和出口价值都较高的大麻、苎麻代替，造成巨大的浪费。
    提倡节约用麻和使用麻的代用品，除必须加强宣传工作，贯彻节约用麻的精神外，国营商业应积极组织和发掘能够代替麻类使用的新货源，作好收购工作，并用实际的试用效果来说服用麻单位，逐渐改变过去的习惯，为国家节省更多的麻。
