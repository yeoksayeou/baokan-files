    Strive to Develop Tea Production
    The tea-picking season is now just over a month away. Many issues concerning tea production, sales, and the supply of materials to tea-producing areas urgently need to be resolved.
    Tea is one of China's main economic crops. It is the most common beverage in the daily lives of people across the country, a necessity for the fraternal ethnic groups in the border regions, and an important export commodity. China has tea production in fifteen provinces and over five hundred counties, most of which are mountainous and hilly areas. For farmers in key tea-producing areas, income from tea cultivation accounts for approximately 40 to 70 percent of their total annual income. Developing tea production is of great significance for supporting the country's socialist industrial construction, meeting the needs of the domestic people's lives, and developing production in mountainous areas.
    Since liberation, China's tea production has developed year by year. Tea production in 1954 increased by more than 30 percent compared to 1950, unit area yield and tea quality have improved, abandoned tea gardens have been gradually restored, and some new tea gardens have been opened up. However, at present, China's tea production is still below the level before the Anti-Japanese War. The output in 1954 was only 54 percent of the pre-war normal output. This is very disproportionate compared to the rapid development of national industrial construction, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and the expanding domestic and foreign markets.
    The reason for the slow growth of tea production is that China's tea gardens have been subjected to long-term destruction by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and many tea trees have been cut down. Since liberation, the tea production and sales leadership departments, for a period, underestimated the trend of continuous expansion of domestic and foreign markets and the increasing demand for tea, lacked long-term plans for the development of tea production, and sometimes developed black tea and sometimes green tea; even once adopted the wrong policy, restricting purchases and compressing tea production, which aggravated the difficulties of restoring and developing tea production, and aggravated the laissez-faire attitude of some local cadres towards tea production. When implementing the purchase price policy, there was also a lack of an active spirit of supporting production. Some standard tea samples were set too high, deviating from the current actual production level, and inaccurate tea grading and cumbersome procedures continued to occur during the purchase process. In some concentrated tea-producing areas, leadership was not properly arranged, and professional cadres were often transferred to other jobs, relaxing the leadership of tea production. In some areas, the supply of grain, agricultural tools, and other means of production and livelihood to tea farmers was not timely enough, affecting the production enthusiasm of tea farmers. Although these phenomena have been continuously corrected in recent years, the current problems have not yet been completely resolved, and therefore must be resolved.
    The Party and government leading organs in tea-producing areas must now strengthen the leadership of tea production, correctly implement the price policy, improve the methods of purchase, break the ideological concerns of tea farmers, and give play to their production enthusiasm. All relevant departments should strengthen contacts and do a good job in all aspects of tea production, sales, and material supply.
    The first step in developing tea production is to rely on existing tea gardens. The main problems with existing tea gardens are the aging of tea trees, insufficient number of plants, and very extensive management, resulting in very low yield per unit area. In the winter of 1954 and the spring of this year, most tea areas had excessive snowfall and a long period of freezing, and tea trees were generally damaged by frost, which seriously affected this year's tea production. In response to these situations, tea farmers must be actively mobilized to carry out soil cultivation, weeding, soil consolidation, frost protection, fertilization, replanting, and replacement of aging tea trees, striving to not only compensate for the losses from frost damage this year, but also to appropriately increase tea production. Reclaiming abandoned tea gardens requires less investment and yields quick results; all localities should organize forces as soon as possible and strive to quickly reclaim all reclaimable abandoned tea gardens.
    However, simply increasing the yield of existing tea gardens cannot meet the growing needs of the country and the people, and new tea gardens must be developed in large numbers. New tea gardens should generally be developed in key areas of the original main tea-producing areas and should not be too scattered. All tea-producing areas should combine with mountain area development plans, conduct specific planning, and promptly solve the problem of insufficient seeds and seedlings. We must strive to ensure that tea production exceeds the level before the Anti-Japanese War by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan – 1962.
    In order to improve tea quality, we must quickly prepare for picking and primary processing. We must thoroughly implement various advanced primary processing technologies, and promote new tools such as tea rolling machines; major tea-producing areas can try to set up primary processing demonstration stations and mechanical primary processing plants to impart advanced experience to tea farmers.
    In order to develop tea production, we must correctly implement the price policy of paying according to quality and strictly prohibit suppressing grades and prices. Although the methods of tea evaluation, pricing, and grading this year have been greatly improved compared to previous years, all localities should promptly announce tea prices and standard tea samples so that tea farmers can make preliminary arrangements for production according to national requirements. Purchasing departments should guarantee the purchase of all tea produced by tea farmers, simplify the methods of grading and pricing, appropriately increase the number of purchasing stations, and facilitate tea farmers to sell tea. The personnel responsible for grading and re-inspecting should be given the necessary training to improve their political and professional level to ensure the correct implementation of the price policy. In order to plan to open up new tea areas in mountainous and hilly areas and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for production, farmers are allowed to apply to use public barren mountains and wastelands to plant tea trees. New and reclaimed tea gardens can be exempt from agricultural tax before the tea trees have any income, and agricultural tax can be appropriately reduced for a certain period when the income is not high. In order to help tea farmers solve the problems of insufficient funds when opening up new and reclaiming tea gardens and purchasing tea-making tools, local People's Banks and credit cooperatives should provide necessary loans and economic support according to specific circumstances. Supply and marketing cooperatives should do a good job in supplying the means of production and livelihood needed by tea area farmers, especially during the tea picking and making season, ensuring the grain supply for tea pickers and tea makers.
    Developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations in tea areas is one of the urgent tasks. Tea production is highly technical and seasonal, requiring a lot of labor. Only by organizing can we better divide labor and specialize, rationally use labor, and solve the contradictions between agriculture and tea production; only by organizing can we facilitate the implementation of various advanced technologies, rapidly increase production, and improve quality. Tea trees are perennial crops with varying ages and vastly different yields. In the process of developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations for tea production, we must pay attention to studying issues such as scoring and recording work, sharing dividends based on shares, and timely summarizing and promoting experience in this regard.
    The Party and government leading organs and relevant departments in tea areas should attach importance to tea production and purchase work, formulate plans for developing tea production based on local specific conditions, study specific policies and various technical measures for realizing the tea production policy, and establish and strengthen specialized tea industry institutions. In major tea areas, we can focus on piloting comprehensive tea area work stations to uniformly control production, purchase, supply, and other work. The leading departments in tea-producing areas should immediately organize and allocate tea pickers and primary processing workers to solve the problem of labor shortage. In 1954, the lack of early resolution of the food problem for tea pickers in Sheng County, Zhejiang, seriously affected the tea picking work. This year, we must make various preparations in advance and strive to pick and make tea in a timely manner. Experience has proven that as long as Party and government organs at all levels strengthen leadership and fully mobilize and rely on the enthusiasm of farmers, it is entirely possible to complete the task of developing tea production.

### 努力发展茶叶生产

    努力发展茶叶生产
    现在距离采茶的季节只有一个多月了。有关茶叶的生产、销售以及对于产茶区的物资供应等许多问题亟应加以解决。
    茶叶是我国的主要经济作物之一。它是全国人民日常生活中最普遍的饮料，是边疆地区兄弟民族的生活必需品，也是重要的出口物资。我国有十五省五百多县产茶，其中多数为山区和丘陵地区。重点茶区农民种植茶叶的收入，约占全年总收入的百分之四十到七十。发展茶叶生产，对于支援国家社会主义工业建设、满足国内人民生活需要、发展山区生产，都有很大的意义。
    解放以后，我国的茶叶生产逐年发展。一九五四年茶叶产量比一九五○年提高百分之三十以上，单位面积产量和茶叶品质都有提高，荒芜茶园逐步恢复，并开辟了部分新茶园。但是，目前我国茶叶生产还低于抗日战争以前的水平。一九五四年的产量，还仅及战前常年产量的百分之五十四。这和国家工业建设的迅速发展，人民生活水平的不断提高，国内外市场的日益扩大的情况相比较是很不相称的。
    茶叶增产缓慢的原因是由于我国的茶园遭受了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派长期破坏，许多茶树被砍伐了。解放以来，茶叶产、销领导部门有一个时期对国内外市场不断扩大、茶叶需要日益增长的趋势估计不足，对茶叶生产的发展缺乏长远计划，时而发展红茶，时而发展绿茶；甚至一度采取了错误的方针，限制收购，压缩茶叶生产，这就加重了恢复和发展茶叶生产的困难，加重了某些地方干部对茶叶生产的放任自流的思想。在执行收购价格政策的时候，也缺乏积极扶持生产的精神，有些标准茶样规定偏高，脱离目前实际生产水平，并且在收购过程中，对茶叶评级不准确，手续繁琐的现象也不断发生。某些茶叶集中的产区，没有适当安排领导力量，往往抽调专业干部担任其他工作，放松了对茶叶生产的领导。有些地区对茶农的粮食、农具等生产和生活资料供应不够及时，影响了茶农的生产情绪。这些现象年来虽已不断纠正，但目前的问题仍然没有完满地得到解决，因此还必须加以解决。
    茶叶产区的党政领导机关，现在必须加强对茶叶生产的领导，正确贯彻价格政策，改善收购的办法，打破茶农的思想顾虑，发挥他们的生产积极性。各有关部门要加强联系，做好茶叶的生产、销售和物资供应等各方面的工作。
    发展茶叶生产首先要依靠现有的茶园。现有茶园的主要问题是茶树衰老，株数不够，管理也很粗放，因此，单位面积产量很低。一九五四年冬天和今年春天，多数茶区降雪过多，冰冻时期较久，茶树普遍遭受冻害，严重影响了今年的茶叶生产。针对这些情况，必须积极发动茶农，进行中耕除草、培土、防春寒、施肥、补种的工作和更换衰老茶树的工作，力争今年茶叶生产不但能补偿冻害的损失，而且能够适当增产。垦复荒芜茶园，投资较小，收效很快；各地应该及早组织力量，争取迅速垦复一切能够垦复的荒芜茶园。
    但是，仅是现有茶园的增产还不能满足国家和人民日益增长的需要，必须大量开拓新茶园。新的茶园一般应在原有主要茶区重点发展，不宜过于分散。所有茶叶产区都应该结合山区发展计划，进行具体规划，及时解决种子、苗木不足的问题。我们必须努力争取茶叶生产在第二个五年计划末期——一九六二年超过抗日战争前的水平。
    为了提高茶叶品质，就要迅速作好采摘和初制的准备工作。要深入贯彻各项先进初制技术，推广揉茶机等新式工具；主要茶叶产区可试办初制示范站和机械初制厂，向茶农传授先进经验。
    为了发展茶叶生产，必须正确贯彻按质论价的价格政策，严禁压级压价。今年评茶计价、划分茶叶级别的方法，虽然已经比往年大有改进，但是各地还应该及时公布茶价和标准茶样，使茶农能按照国家要求，对生产预作安排。收购部门应该保证全部收购茶农生产的茶叶，简化评级计价的方法，适当增设收购站，便利茶农售茶。对于评级和复验的人员，应进行必要的训练，提高他们的政治和业务水平，以保证价格政策的正确执行。为了有计划地在山区丘陵地带开辟新茶区，鼓励群众生产积极性，允许农民申请使用公有荒山荒地栽种茶树。新辟和垦复的茶园在茶树还没有收益以前可以免征农业税，在收益不多的一定时期可以酌减农业税。为了帮助茶农解决新辟、垦复茶园和购置制茶工具时资金不足等问题，各地人民银行、信用合作社应该根据具体情况，给予必要的贷款和经济扶持。供销合作社应作好茶区农民所需要的生产、生活资料的供应工作，特别是在茶叶采制季节，应保证采茶工人和制茶工人的粮食供应。
    发展茶区互助合作组织是迫切的任务之一。茶叶生产带有很大的技术性和季节性，所需劳力较多，只有组织起来，才能更好地分工分业，合理地使用劳动力，解决农业和茶叶生产之间的矛盾；只有组织起来，才便于贯彻各项先进技术，迅速增加产量，提高品质。茶树是多年生的作物，树龄大小不一，产量高低悬殊，在发展茶叶生产互助合作组织过程中，必须注意研究有关评分记工、入股分红等问题，并及时总结推广这方面的经验。
    茶区的党政领导机关和有关部门应该重视茶叶生产和收购工作，根据当地具体情况，拟定发展茶叶生产的计划，研究实现茶叶生产方针的具体政策和各项技术措施，建立和充实茶业的专业机构。在主要茶区，可以重点试办综合性的茶区工作站，统一掌握生产、收购、供应等工作。茶叶产区的领导部门，目前应即进行采茶工人和初制工人的组织调配工作，以解决劳力缺乏的问题。一九五四年浙江嵊县因为采茶工的口粮问题没有及早解决，严重地影响了采茶工作。今年要预先作好各种准备工作，争取及时采茶制茶。经验证明，只要各级党政机关加强领导，充分发动和依靠农民的积极性，完成发展茶叶生产的任务是完全可能的。
