Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 23rd: The Fourth Session of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic opened in Prague on March 21st. The President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Zápotocký, the Prime Minister, Široký, and others attended the meeting.

At the meeting, the Chairman of the National Assembly, Zdeněk Fierlinger, delivered a speech. He expressed his full support for the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the various peace initiatives recently put forward by the Soviet Union, and condemned the "strength" policy of the American ruling clique, which used atomic warfare as a threat. Fierlinger emphasized that we do not beg for peace, nor are we intimidated by others threatening us. We must strengthen our defense forces and mercilessly crush all the enemy's conspiracies.

Subsequently, the Chairman of the Czechoslovak State Planning Commission, Simunek, gave a report on the draft national economic development plan for 1955.

Simunek pointed out that the main tasks of the 1955 national economic development plan are to ensure the improvement of the living standards of the working people and the strengthening of the country's defense capabilities on the basis of increasing production, improving labor productivity, comprehensively strengthening the economy, and rapidly developing agriculture.

Simunek said: The 1955 plan stipulates increasing coal production by 5 percent, increasing power generation by nearly 10 percent, and expanding the mining base. The plan particularly emphasizes geological exploration for coal and mineral production. Simunek said that the emphasis in the 1955 plan on heavy industry and concentrating efforts on developing fuel, power, and mining bases indicates that we are continuing to follow the path that we have been firmly adhering to since the beginning of the Five-Year Plan. Simunek also talked about the importance of developing key industrial sectors - the machine-building industry.

Simunek pointed out that in terms of agricultural production, the cultivated area in 1955 will be expanded by 120,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu), and the yield per unit area of ​​major grains will be increased by one-fifth; at the same time, emphasis will be placed on increasing the output of feed crops.

Simunek talked about the need to ensure an increase in the variety and quality of consumer goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 23rd: The National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic continued its session on the 22nd. The meeting heard and discussed the report on the 1955 national budget made by the Republic's Minister of Finance, Ďuriš.

Ďuriš said in his report: The 1955 national budget serves the needs of the people and peace. It provides a guarantee of financial strength for the further development of industry, especially heavy industry, the accelerated development of agriculture, the further expansion of consumer goods production, the continuous improvement of material and cultural levels, and the further strengthening of national defense.

The total revenue for 1955 is 86.209 billion crowns (Czech currency), and the total expenditure is 86.039 billion crowns, with a surplus of 170 million crowns. Fifty-one percent of the budget expenditure will be used for the development of the national economy, 32.9 percent for the development of culture, health, and social welfare facilities, and 4 percent for state administration.

The appropriation for the further development of industry in 1955 will reach 14.112 billion crowns, while it was 13.555 billion crowns in 1954. The majority of industrial appropriations will be used for the development of coal mining, mining, and electricity production, as well as for increasing and improving the production of metallurgy, machinery, and the chemical industry. The appropriation for agriculture is 7.952 billion crowns, an increase of 20.4 percent compared to 1954. The total expenditure on agricultural mechanization will increase by 91 percent compared to 1954.

Ďuriš said: 12.1 percent of the budget expenditure will be used for national defense, while it was 8.9 percent in 1954. Ďuriš said that in our peaceful development, we must never forget that the reactionary forces in the West hope to launch a new war, and they hope to destroy our peaceful life. Therefore, our responsibility is to ensure that the people's army has everything necessary to defend the fruits of the people's labor and defend the republic from the invasion of the resurrected German Wehrmacht.

Ďuriš pointed out that the main part of the budget revenue in 1955, namely 84.8 percent, will come from the profits of socialist enterprises, while the income from people paying taxes will only account for 11.9 percent.

After hearing Ďuriš's report, the meeting began discussions.
