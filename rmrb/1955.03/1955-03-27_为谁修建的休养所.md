    For Whom Was the Sanatorium Built?
    To the Editor:
    On the west bank of the Xiang River, beside Mount Yuelu, stands a conspicuous sanatorium – the Hunan Provincial People's Bank Sanatorium. This sanatorium covers an area of more than 160 mu, with a building area of more than 5,300 square meters in 17 buildings of various sizes; the construction cost, equipment cost, and environmental construction cost totaled more than 300,000 yuan. The four two-story ward buildings have 200 beds, and the office building has medical equipment such as X-ray machines, sunlamps, and electrotherapy machines. There are a total of 49 staff members, with monthly expenses exceeding 4,000 yuan. This sanatorium is considered one of the largest and best-equipped in Changsha.
    Strangely, there have always been very few people living in the sanatorium (currently there are more than 70 people). According to statistics from February of this year, the bed occupancy rate is less than one-third. The X-ray machine has only been used for 21 hours from the beginning of its use in mid-November of last year to mid-March; the sunlamps are also often left unused.
    At a time when state-established sanatoriums have not yet been extensively developed, it is necessary for various industrial and mining enterprises and organizations to establish small and simple sanatoriums (rooms) for staff members who cannot continue working and whose conditions are not very serious. However, the scale of the Hunan Provincial People's Bank Sanatorium is not in line with the nature of an organizational sanatorium; because the equipment of this institution not only exceeds the level of general organizational sanatoriums, but also cannot solve the problem of sanatorium care for patients in all the Hunan Provincial People's Bank's subordinate organizations. Some branches located in remote mountainous areas have to set up small sanatoriums (rooms) due to inconvenient transportation. Central branches such as Xiangnan and Chen County also have their own sanatoriums (rooms). The Hunan Provincial People's Bank's blindly building such a large-scale sanatorium is obviously a waste of useful state funds and violates the principle of key construction.
    Why does a provincial people's bank need to run such a large sanatorium, allowing its buildings and equipment to be in a semi-dormant state for a long time? Do the responsible comrades of the Provincial People's Bank not understand that wasting and idling useful state funds is a crime? Yao Yongchu

### 为谁修建的休养所

    为谁修建的休养所编辑同志：
    在湘江西岸，岳麓山旁，有一座引人注意的休养所——湖南省人民银行的休养所。这座休养所占地一百六十多亩，大小十七幢房子的建筑面积共五千三百多平方公尺；建筑费、设备费和环境修建费共花去三十多万元。四幢二层楼的病房里有两百个床位，办公楼里有爱克斯光机、太阳灯和电疗机等医疗设备。工作人员共有四十九人，每月开支在四千元以上。这个休养所在长沙市算是规模最大、设备较好的一个。
    奇怪的是住所休养的人一直很少（现在有七十多人）。据今年二月份的统计，病床利用率不到三分之一。爱克斯光机从去年十一月中旬开始使用起，到三月中旬为止，只利用了二十一小时；太阳灯也是经常放着不用。
    在目前国家设立的休养机构还没有大量发展的时候，各工矿企业和机关团体设立小型的简单的休养所（室），供本单位不能坚持工作而病情不很严重的工作人员休养，这是必要的。但是，湖南省人民银行休养所的规模和机关休养机构的性质是不相符合的；因为这种机构设备不仅超越了一般机关休养所的水平，而且也不能解决全省人民银行所属机关的病员休养问题。有些处于边远山区的支行，因为交通不便，还得成立小型休养室，像湘南、郴县等中心支行都设有自己的休养室。湖南省人民银行盲目修建这样大规模的休养所显然是浪费国家有用的资金，违反重点建设的原则的。
    为什么一个省的人民银行要办这样大的一个休养所，让它的房屋、设备长期处于半休养状态呢？难道省人民银行的负责同志还不懂得浪费和闲置国家有用的资金是一种罪过吗？         姚永初
