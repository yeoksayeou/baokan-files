    Sani People's Poem "Ashima" Published
    A long narrative poem, "Ashima," which has been circulating among the Sani people of Yunnan for a long time, has been published as a separate book. The Foreign Languages ​​Press has also translated it into English and plans to publish it in the English-language magazine "Chinese Literature."
    In this poem, the typical images of two working young people, Ashima and Ahei, are created, praising their labor, bravery, honesty and love, and expressing their strong will and optimistic spirit to resist oppression and pursue happiness. Sani girls are still proud to say: We are all Ashima.
    This long narrative poem was collected and compiled by the Guishan Working Group of the Yunnan Provincial People's Literary and Art Troupe after they went deep into the Sani people's settlements. In the process of sorting it out, they received enthusiastic help from the Sani people. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    撒尼人诗歌“阿诗玛”出版
    一部长期流传在云南撒尼人民中的长篇叙事诗歌“阿诗玛”，已出版了单行本。外文出版社并译成英文，准备在英文刊物“中国文学”上发表。
    人们在这部诗歌中，创造了阿诗玛和阿黑两个劳动青年的典型形象，歌颂他们的劳动、勇敢、正直和爱情，并表现了他们反抗压迫、追求幸福的坚强意志和乐观精神。撒尼姑娘们至今还骄傲地说：我们个个都是阿诗玛。
    这部长篇叙事诗是云南省人民文艺工作团圭山工作组深入撒尼人聚居地区搜集、整理的。在整理过程中，他们得到撒尼人民的热情帮助。（据新华社讯）
