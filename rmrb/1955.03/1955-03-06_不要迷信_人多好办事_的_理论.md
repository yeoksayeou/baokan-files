Don't Believe in the "Theory" that "More People Makes Things Easier"
Kong Sang

In economic agencies and enterprises, some people are very superstitious about the "theory" that "more people makes things easier" and overly worship the power of official documents and reports. In their view, the more people there are, the better the production and work can be done, and the larger the organization, the more impressive it seems. And if there are not too many official documents and reports, it seems impossible to carry out work or production. As a result, some already-large establishments are expanded again and again; there are so many official documents and reports that they cannot be read. The result is that the organization is large and bloated, there are more staff than needed, work efficiency is not high, and many specific problems in production are often delayed by excessive paperwork and report exchanges.

Some leading comrades of economic agencies and enterprises, although deeply aware of the suffering caused by bloated organizations and excessive official documents and reports, dare not move them even slightly and still allow unreasonable phenomena to continue to develop. However, those agencies and enterprises that have seriously streamlined their organizations and reduced official documents and reports have achieved good results in production and work. The recent case of the Fushun Mining Bureau is an example.

In the past, the Fushun Mining Bureau had a large and bloated organization with numerous official documents and reports. Adjustments were made over the years, but the problem was never completely resolved. Recently, following the instructions of higher authorities, they resolutely abolished overlapping organizations in the overall production reform and reduced various reports by nearly half. As a result, not only were more than 1,200 cadres transferred to the mines to participate in coal mining or to participate in various technical studies, but also the staff of the departments were able to free up more time to study and solve the key problems existing in mine production. According to statistics from the units that have undergone reform, although the number of staff members has been reduced by half, work efficiency has doubled.

Due to the strengthening of work in the coal mining areas, the improvement of efficiency in the departments, and the deepening of work, new atmospheres immediately appeared in the production of the coal mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau. For example, the staff members in charge of auxiliary production carefully checked the ventilation, equipment maintenance, and other conditions affecting production, and promoted the start of more than 20 projects that no one had managed in the past; the technical personnel of the open-pit coal mine cooperated with the workers to improve a number of equipment and operating methods. Now that the mine's plan to improve old equipment and increase the degree of mechanization has just achieved more than 20 items, the employees are full of confidence and proposed: This year, we will produce more than 500,000 tons more of raw coal than last year, and strip more than 4 million cubic meters more of oil shale.

Facts have proved that streamlining organizations and reducing unnecessary official documents and reports is very beneficial to improving work efficiency and improving production. Therefore, believing in the "theory" that "more people makes things easier" is wrong, and worshiping the power of official documents and reports is also incorrect. We should resolutely and systematically streamline organizations and reduce official documents and reports in order to improve work efficiency and develop production.

    不要迷信“人多好办事”的“理论”
    孔桑
    在经济机关和企业里，有些人很迷信“人多好办事”的“理论”，也过份崇拜公文表报的威力。在他们看来，人越多似乎越能把生产和工作搞好，机构越庞大似乎越威风；而公文表报不太多，好像就无法进行工作或生产似的。于是，若干已经很不小的编制还是一再扩充；各种公文表报多得看不过来。结果是机构庞大臃肿，人浮于事，工作效率不高，生产中的许多具体问题，往往被过多的公文旅行和表报往来给耽误了。
    有些经济机关和企业的领导同志，虽然深深感到机构臃肿、公文表报过多的苦处，但却不敢稍许动它们一动，仍然听任不合理的现象继续发展。然而，那些认真精简了机构和减少了公文表报的机关和企业，在生产和工作上却取得了良好的效果。抚顺矿务局最近的事实就是一个例子。
    抚顺矿务局过去机构庞大臃肿，公文表报繁多，历年进行调整，问题总是没有彻底解决。最近，他们遵照上级指示，在全面的生产改革中坚决取消了重叠的机构，并将各种表报减少了将近一半。结果不仅抽出了一千二百多个干部到矿井参加采煤区的工作或参加各种技术学习，而且使科室工作人员可以腾出更多的时间，研究和解决矿山生产中存在的关键问题。据已进行改革的单位的统计，工作人员的数量虽然减少了一半，工作效率却成倍地提高了。
    由于采煤区工作的加强，科室工作的效率提高和工作开始深入，抚顺矿务局所属煤矿在生产中立即出现了新气象，例如：担任辅助生产的工作人员们详细检查了影响生产的通风、设备检修等情形，就促使过去没有人管的二十多项工程开工了；露天煤矿的技术人员同工人合作，改进了若干设备和操作方法，现在，这个矿改进旧设备、提高机械化程度的计划刚刚实现了二十多项，职工们就信心百倍地提出：今年要比去年多生产五十多万吨原煤，多剥离油母页岩四百多万立方公尺。
    事实证明：精简机构和减少不必要的公文表报，对于提高工作效率、改进生产是大有好处的。因此，迷信“人多好办事”的“理论”是错误的，崇拜公文表报的威力也是不对的。我们应该坚决地有计划地精简机构，减少公文表报，以提高工作效率，发展生产。
