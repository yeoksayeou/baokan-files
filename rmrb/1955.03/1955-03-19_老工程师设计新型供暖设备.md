    Old Engineer Designs New Heating Equipment
    In the Xizhimen area of the capital, a newly completed six-story building with an area of 9,300 square meters is equipped with a new type of heating system. It replaces the steam heating system with a cast iron boiler single-pipe sequential forced circulation hot water heating method, which not only reduces the cost of the equipment itself by 40%, but also saves 120 tons of coal per year.
    The installation workers of this heating equipment believe that the installation method of this single-pipe heating equipment is not only labor-saving but also convenient. The efficiency is more than doubled compared with the installation of double-pipe heating equipment. At the same time, because the steam in the radiator is changed to hot water, the air in the room does not feel dry at all. The method of using a cast iron boiler instead of a high-pressure boiler is also very simple. As long as a safety tank is installed on the hot water main pipe, there will be no water leakage or rupture.
    The new heating equipment was created by Zhang Molin, an old engineer in his seventies at the Urban Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, after studying advanced Soviet experience. For every 10,000 square meters of houses using this equipment, six tons of steel can be saved. Up to now, Zhang Molin has designed heating equipment for 400,000 square meters of buildings in Beijing, Tianjin, Baotou, Baoding and other cities, saving the country more than 3 million yuan.

    老工程师设计新型供暖设备
    在首都西直门内，一座新落成的面积九千三百平方公尺的六层大楼里面，装置着一套新型的供暖设备。它用铸铁锅炉单管顺序强制循环热水供暖法代替了蒸气供暖设备，不仅设备本身的造价降低了百分之四十，而且每年可节省煤一百二十吨。
    这套供暖设备的安装工人认为：这种单管供暖设备的安装方法既省工，又方便，比安装双管供暖设备的效率平均要提高一倍多。同时，因为把暖汽片里盛的蒸汽改为热水，使室内的空气一点也不感到干燥。用铸铁锅炉代替高压锅炉的办法也很简单，只要在送热水主管上安装一个保险罐，就不会发生漏水和破裂情况。
    新型的供暖设备是建筑工程部城市设计院七十多岁的老工程师张墨林，学习了苏联先进经验后创造的。每一万平方公尺房屋采用这种设备，可节省六吨钢材。到现在为止，张墨林已为北京、天津、包头、保定等城市，设计了四十万平方公尺建筑物的供暖设备，为国家节省了三百多万元。  （新华社）
