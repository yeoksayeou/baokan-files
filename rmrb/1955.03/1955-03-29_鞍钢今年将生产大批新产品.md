    Anshan Iron and Steel Company will produce a new product for the country on average every five days this year. Among these products are a batch of steel materials trial-rolled for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, including thin steel plates for manufacturing automobile carriages and bodies, medium steel plates for manufacturing frames, and other types of steel; as well as new types of angle steel and unequal angle steel rolled for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project. The large rolling mill recently rolled China's first giant I-beam, and this year it will also roll fifty-kilogram heavy rails and Z-shaped steel for locomotive use. New products also include silicon steel sheets for manufacturing generators. Workers at the steel rope factory will produce a triangular steel rope this year, which can reduce wear on giant winders used in iron-smelting furnaces and coal mines, and is more durable than ordinary steel ropes.

    Anshan Refractory Materials Plant, which specializes in supplying refractory materials to the whole country, in addition to successfully trial-producing spalling-resistant open-hearth chrome-magnesia bricks, will also trial-produce a high-quality silica brick this year. Furnace roofs made of this brick will be more durable than those made of ordinary silica bricks.

    Preparations for the trial production of new products are underway in various departments of Anshan Iron and Steel. Engineers in the Technology Department are preparing trial rolling procedures for new products to be trial-produced in the second quarter. In the die design office of the chief rolling engineer, the die shapes for eleven new products are being designed simultaneously.

    鞍钢今年将生产大批新产品
    鞍山钢铁公司今年平均每隔五天就要为国家生产一种新的产品。在这些产品中有一批是为第一汽车制造厂试轧的钢材，包括制造汽车车箱和车身用的薄钢板，制造车架用的中型钢板和其他类型的钢材；还有为武汉长江大桥工程轧制的新型角钢和不等边角钢。大型轧钢厂在不久以前轧制了我国第一根巨型的工字钢，今年还要轧制五十公斤的重轨和做火车机车用的乙字钢。新产品中还有制造发电机用的矽钢片。钢绳厂的工人们今年将要生产一种三角形的钢绳，这种钢绳用在炼铁炉和煤矿的巨型卷扬机上时，可以减少卷扬机的磨损，并且比普通钢绳耐用。
    专以耐火材料供应全国各地的鞍钢耐火材料厂，除已试制成功耐崩裂性平炉铬镁砖外，今年还将试制一种高质矽砖，用这种砖做成的炼钢炉炉顶，要比普通矽砖做的炉顶耐用。
    新产品试制的准备工作，正在鞍钢各部门进行。技术处的工程师们正在为第二季度就要试制的新产品作试轧规程。在总轧钢师孔型设计室里，有十一种新产品的孔型正在同时设计。　（新华社）
