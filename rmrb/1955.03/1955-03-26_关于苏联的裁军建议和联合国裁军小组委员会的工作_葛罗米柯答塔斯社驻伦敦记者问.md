Xinhua News Agency, London, March 25th: The Soviet representative to the current meeting in London of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko, gave a statement to a TASS correspondent in London on the 24th. The questions asked by the reporter and Gromyko’s answers are as follows:

Question: Some political figures in Western countries, as well as some newspapers in those countries, say that the difficulties encountered by the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee are caused by the Soviet Union's position. What is your assessment of this argument?

Answer: The purpose of such remarks by some political figures in Western countries, as well as news from some newspapers in these countries, is nothing more than to mislead international public opinion, attempting to obscure who is responsible for the current situation in the negotiations on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons in London.

Such a conspiracy is nothing new. Whenever the Soviet government, which consistently pursues a policy of consolidating international peace, puts forward proposals aimed at stopping the arms race, reducing armaments, especially the armaments of the five major powers, and prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, such conspiracies are carried out.

The purpose of this conspiracy is obviously to prevent the reaching of international agreements on these issues and to continue the arms race, increase the number of armed forces, and produce atomic and hydrogen weapons on a larger scale.

Question: In view of the emergence of some news in Western newspapers that attempts to cast doubt on the policy adopted by the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, could you explain the substance of the Soviet government's proposals currently under discussion by the Subcommittee?

Answer: On March 18th, the Soviet government submitted to a Subcommittee meeting for discussion a proposal on concluding an international convention on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet government suggested that the well-known proposals put forward by France and the United Kingdom on June 11, 1954, be used as the basis for this convention, because the main clauses of the British and French proposals were not different from the position taken by the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

In view of this, according to the Soviet government's proposal, the main provisions of the above-mentioned convention should be stipulated as follows:

One, all countries should reduce armaments, armed forces, and appropriations for military purposes in national budgets by 50 percent of an agreed amount within six months or one year. The reduction of armaments and armed forces should be based on their level on January 1, 1955, and the reduction of appropriations should be based on the level of appropriations for military needs in 1955.

Countries undertake the following obligations as the first step towards reducing armaments and armed forces: No country shall increase its armaments and the number of its armed forces beyond the level of January 1, 1955, nor increase its appropriations for military needs beyond the level of appropriations for military needs in 1955.

It is stipulated that the five major powers—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the Soviet Union—must substantially reduce their armaments and armed forces.

In order to implement further measures on universal disarmament, it is stipulated that a world conference on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, with the participation of member and non-member states of the United Nations, be held in 1955.

When stipulating the quota for disarmament, it is necessary to base it on simple standards agreed upon by all, including factors such as population, geography, economy, and politics, with the aim of strengthening universal peace and international security and reducing the threat of aggression.

The Soviet proposal pays special attention to the important issue of international supervision over the implementation by countries of the obligations stipulated in the convention. It also stipulates that a corresponding supervisory agency should be established from the time when measures related to disarmament begin to be implemented. For this purpose, a temporary international supervisory committee should be established under the United Nations Security Council. This committee has the right to request countries to report on the necessary information regarding the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and armed forces. The temporary international supervisory committee should take necessary measures to supervise the fulfillment by countries of their obligations in reducing armaments, armed forces, and appropriations for military needs. At the same time, the committee's scope of functions should also include necessary supervision over the implementation by countries of their obligations in restricting armaments, armed forces, and appropriations for military needs. Countries are obliged to report regularly to the committee within a specified period on the implementation of the measures stipulated in the convention.

The above measures should be implemented simultaneously.

Two, the Soviet Union suggests that after the above measures have been completed, further measures to reduce armaments should be implemented, and measures to prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction should be implemented simultaneously.

According to the Soviet proposal, all countries should, within six months (or one year), reduce their armaments, armed forces, and appropriations for military needs by another agreed-upon amount of the remaining 50 percent. The reduction of armaments and armed forces should be based on the level of armaments and armed forces on January 1, 1955, and the reduction of appropriations should be based on the level of appropriations for military needs in 1955. Within the above-mentioned period, atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction should be completely prohibited, and the production of such weapons should be stopped. Such weapons should be completely removed from the armaments of various countries, so that atomic materials are only used for peaceful purposes.

In view of the exceptional importance of the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet proposal stipulates that the complete realization of the above-mentioned measures regarding such weapons and other weapons of mass destruction must not be delayed beyond the completion of measures to reduce the other half of armaments and armed forces in accordance with agreed-upon quotas. When armaments, armed forces, and appropriations for military needs begin to be reduced again by the remaining 50 percent of the agreed-upon quotas, the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons should be stopped immediately. In order to conduct necessary international supervision over the compliance by countries with the above-mentioned convention, it is stipulated that a permanent international supervisory agency should be established, and this agency should begin to perform its responsibilities at the same time as the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons stipulated in this stage begins.

The Soviet government’s proposal directly points out that the supervision implemented by such international agencies, including inspections on a permanent basis, should reach the extent necessary to ensure that all countries fulfill the obligations they have undertaken under the convention.

In addition, the Soviet government's proposal points out that the international supervisory agency will have inspectors permanently stationed in all contracting countries, who, within the scope of their supervisory functions, can inspect all objects of supervision at any time without obstruction.

The suggestion stipulates that personnel selected according to international principles will be absorbed to participate in the inspection work, which will also help the agency effectively fulfill its functions.

Three, the Soviet Union proceeds from the point that after the above-mentioned measures stipulated in the convention are completed, it is important that countries continue to devote themselves to further disarmament. Based on this, the proposed convention directly points out that it is appropriate for countries to further reduce their armaments and armed forces to a level that is absolutely necessary for maintaining domestic security and fulfilling the obligations entrusted to them by the United Nations Charter.

It can be seen from this that the Soviet proposals contain the basic principles of an international convention on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and point out the order in which corresponding measures should be implemented, starting with the restriction of armaments, armed forces, and appropriations for military needs, as the first step towards reducing the armaments and armed forces of various countries.

It must be emphasized that the Soviet proposal of March 18th and the aforementioned Franco-British proposal of June 11, 1954, stipulate that these measures initially only involve conventional armaments, until the armaments and armed forces of various countries have been reduced by half of the quota agreed upon in the negotiations.

As always, the Soviet Union believes that in order to consolidate international peace and eliminate the threat of atomic war, atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons must be immediately and unconditionally prohibited, and these weapons must be removed from armaments. However, as everyone knows, it has not been possible to reach an agreement on this issue due to the position taken by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The governments of these three countries oppose this proposal under various pretexts, even though this proposal is in line with the increasingly strong demands of the people of all countries to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, thereby eliminating the threat of destructive atomic war. The above-mentioned Western governments also disagreed during the disarmament subcommittee negotiations with the Soviet government’s proposal, put forward at the beginning of the London talks, to destroy the atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons currently stored in various countries and to use atomic materials only for peaceful purposes, even though reaching an agreement on this issue would promote the reaching of agreements on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and other issues related to the reduction of armaments.

The Soviet government's proposal of March 18th stipulates that only measures to reduce conventional armaments should be taken initially, which facilitates reaching the necessary understanding, as is also stipulated in the Franco-British proposal.

The significance of the Soviet proposal on the substantial reduction of armaments by the five major powers is inestimable.

The necessity and urgency of this proposal are self-evident, because the reduction of armaments and armed forces by these major powers is of decisive significance, as long as the phrase "substantial reduction" is not understood as a mere declaration, as the Western countries are trying to do, while in reality evading making such a reduction in armaments.

The same should be said about the Soviet proposal on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This proposal stipulates: first, the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons should be stopped immediately when the reduction of the remaining 50 percent of armaments in agreed-upon quotas begins; second, the complete prohibition of such weapons should not be postponed indefinitely, but should not be delayed beyond the completion of measures to reduce conventional armaments within agreed-upon quotas. It is not difficult to see that reaching an agreement on this point is of great significance for consolidating peace.

As pointed out earlier, the Soviet proposal emphasizes the importance of international supervision over the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, and especially emphasizes the role of inspection in this work. This should put an end to all speculation about the so-called Soviet unwillingness to establish international supervision to supervise the implementation by countries of the obligations of international conventions.

At the same time, it must also be emphasized that the Soviet proposal on convening a world conference on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons in 1955 in order to implement further measures to reduce armaments is of great significance. Convening this conference with the broad participation of all countries to discuss issues of deep concern to the people of all countries will be of great significance for consolidating international security. Convening such a conference will make it possible for all countries, whether large or small, to actively participate in discussing issues that are closely related to the people of all countries.

Therefore, the Soviet proposals provide a good basis for reaching consensus between the Soviet Union and Western countries. If adopted, these proposals can ensure the proper resolution of the issue of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, thereby properly resolving the issue of eliminating the threat of a new world war.

All of the above shows that the Soviet government's proposal of March 18th is another important contribution by the Soviet Union to disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Question: Can you talk about the attitude taken by the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada when the Subcommittee discussed the Soviet proposals, and what are your views on their attitudes? This question is also of interest because some newspapers in Western countries have also made clearly one-sided reports on the Subcommittee's situation in this regard.

Answer: First of all, it must be pointed out that when the Soviet Union submitted to the Subcommittee on February 25th the proposal to destroy the atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons currently stored in various countries and to restrict the armaments, armed forces, and military appropriations of various countries as the first step in reducing armaments and armed forces, the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France opposed these Soviet proposals and at the same time demanded a rapid transition to discussing the Soviet government's proposal on concluding a convention on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union also submitted the main principles of this convention to the most recent session of the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. Later, when the Subcommittee began to discuss the Soviet government's proposal of March 18th on concluding the above-mentioned convention, the representatives of Western countries again began to look for various excuses to oppose these proposals.

Right from the start of the discussion of the Soviet proposals, it could be seen that the representatives of Western countries were trying to avoid discussing the issue of measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, and only wanted to discuss the issue of international supervision. The Soviet representative had reminded them that the Soviet proposal stipulates that effective international supervision must be established, and therefore, our task is to reach an agreement on the measures themselves to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons, but the representatives of Western countries always hinted that the discussion of these issues should be classified as secondary matters.

It can be clearly seen from this that, in general, they are also trying to find ways to undermine the reaching of agreements on international supervision. Regarding this point, it can first be seen from a demand they made, that they demanded that when establishing supervision, the nature of the measures taken in reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons should not be taken into consideration. They wanted to stipulate in the convention the establishment of a permanent international supervisory agency, which, among other powers, would have the right of inspection in the first stage, that is, before measures to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons have been implemented. This desire is not difficult to see through, because hidden behind this desire is an intention to establish a one-sided supervision that does not involve atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, the most dangerous weapons. This is certainly unacceptable.

We asked: Do Western countries agree that a permanent supervisory agency should begin work at the same time as the implementation of measures to reduce conventional armaments and prohibit atomic weapons begins? The representatives of Western countries flatly said that they did not agree to do so, thus once again demonstrating that the reason they put the issue of supervision in the first place was to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on the issue of supervision and on the issue of the measures that should be implemented under supervision. This gives us reason to conclude that they are actually unwilling to seriously discuss the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces and prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons.

At the same time, we should also talk about the attitude taken by Western countries on the issue of substantial reductions in armaments and armed forces by the five major powers and on the issue of quotas for disarmament. Verbally, their representatives expressed their agreement to substantial reductions in armaments by the five major powers. However, when the issue was discussed concretely, it could be seen that they had no intention of making substantial reductions in armaments at all. The best proof of this is that they tried to replace the issue of an agreed quota for reducing armaments and armed forces with the issue of the level of armaments and armed forces, which, according to their own admission, would justify raising the issue of increasing armed forces and armaments in certain circumstances. In this regard, their attitude toward the proposal to reduce the armaments, armed forces, and budgetary appropriations of the five major powers by one-third, and to use this number as an agreed quota, is very noteworthy. The representatives of Western countries flatly stated their opposition to this proposal.

The representatives of Western countries tried their best to avoid clearly stipulating a time limit for the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons.

For example, the British representative tried to prove that it seemed completely unnecessary to include clauses on the time limit for the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons in the convention. For example, while the representatives of Western countries talked a lot about the time limit for reducing the strength of armed forces, they actually advocated leaving the resolution of the time limit issue to the supervisory agency, which, to put it bluntly, meant they wanted to avoid talking about the time limit issue.

Needless to say, this convention would not be of much value if it did not specify the time limit within which measures to reduce conventional armaments should be completed, nor the time limit within which measures to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons should be realized.

Until now, the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada have, despite the insistence of the Soviet Union, not expressed their willingness to carefully discuss the Soviet government's proposal on measures to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons. On this issue, they have so far limited themselves to expressing general opinions, that is, making the fate of all measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons dependent on whether their views on the issue of supervision are accepted.

Even based on the above-mentioned attitudes of Western countries toward the Soviet proposals, it is sufficient to conclude who is really creating difficulties for the work of the disarmament subcommittee.

In addition, it is noteworthy that just when the disarmament subcommittee began its work, politicians in Western countries clamored, and newspapers in those countries stepped up their propaganda, to greatly expand their armaments, especially atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and to oppose the prohibition of these weapons. This fact also shows that while the Soviet Union is striving to promote the reaching of necessary agreements on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, thereby promoting the easing of international tensions and eliminating the threat of a new war, Western countries are continuing to pursue a policy of stepping up the expansion of armaments, which is contrary to the decision of the United Nations General Assembly to entrust the subcommittee to seek possibilities in order to reach necessary agreements on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

As for the Soviet Union, its representatives on the subcommittee will continue to promote the reaching of necessary agreements on this important issue in the future.

    关于苏联的裁军建议和联合国裁军小组委员会的工作
    葛罗米柯答塔斯社驻伦敦记者问
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日电：苏联出席目前在伦敦举行的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议的代表、苏联外交部第一副部长安·安·葛罗米柯二十四日向塔斯社驻伦敦记者发表谈话。记者提出的问题和葛罗米柯的回答如下：
    问：西方国家某些政界人士以及这些国家的某些报纸的消息说，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会所遭到的困难是由于苏联的立场而造成的，你对这种论调作什么评价？
    答：西方国家某些政界人士的这种言论以及这些国家某些报纸的消息的目的无非是要迷惑国际舆论，企图使人看不清到底是谁应当对目前在伦敦举行的关于各国裁减军备和禁止原子武器的谈判所出现的局面负责。
    这种阴谋并不是什么新东西。每当坚持不渝地奉行巩固国际和平的政策的苏联政府提出目的在于停止军备竞赛、裁减军备、首先是裁减五大国的军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器的建议的时候，就有人进行这种阴谋。
    这种阴谋的目的，显然是要阻止在这些问题上达成国际协议，并且继续进行军备竞赛、增加武装部队的人数，更大规模地生产原子武器和氢武器。
    问：鉴于西方国家的报纸上出现了一些企图对苏联在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题上所采取的政策散布怀疑的消息，你是否可以就小组委员会现在正在讨论的苏联政府的建议的实质解释一下？
    答：苏联政府在三月十八日已经把关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约的建议，提交小组委员会讨论。苏联政府建议，将法国和英国在一九五四年六月十一日提出的大家都知道的建议作为这一公约的基础，因为英法这一建议的主要条款同苏联在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题上所采取的立场没有差别。
    鉴于这种情况，根据苏联政府的建议，上述的公约的主要条款应当作如下的规定：
    一、各国应在六个月或者一年内把军备、武装部队和国家预算中用在军事目的上的拨款加以削减，削减的数量为一致同意的定额的百分之五十。军备及武装部队的裁减应以它们在一九五五年一月一日的水平为起算点，拨款的削减应以一九五五年的军事需要拨款的水平为起算点。
    各国承担下列义务作为导向裁减军备和武装部队的第一个步骤：各国不得把自己的军备和武装部队的数量增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，也不得把军事需要拨款增加到超过一九五五年军事需要拨款的水平。
    规定五大国——美国、英国、法国、中国和苏联——必须大量裁减军备和武装部队。
    为了实行关于普遍裁减军备的进一步的措施，规定在一九五五年内召开有联合国会员国和非会员国参加的、关于普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器的世界会议。
    在规定裁减军备的定额的时候，必须根据一致同意的简单的标准，包括人口、地理、经济和政治等因素，其目的要加强普遍和平和国际安全，并减少侵略的威胁。
    苏联的建议特别重视对各国执行公约所规定的义务的情况进行国际监督这一个重要的问题。并且规定，从开始实行有关裁减军备的措施的时候起，就应该建立一个相应的监督机构。为了这一目的，应规定在联合国安全理事会之下建立一个临时国际监督委员会，这个委员会有权要求各国报告关于实行裁减军备和武装部队的措施的必要情况。临时国际监督委员会应当采取必要措施，监督各国履行它们在削减军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款方面所承担的义务。同时，委员会的职权范围还应当包括对各国履行在限制军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款方面的义务的情况进行必要的监督。各国有义务在规定期限内定期向委员会报告公约所规定的措施的履行情况。
    上述措施应当同时实施。
    二、苏联建议规定，在上述措施完成之后，就应当执行裁减军备的进一步措施，并且同时执行禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的措施。
    根据苏联建议，各国还应当在六个月内（或是一年内）把军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款再削减一致同意的定额的余下的百分之五十，军备和武装部队的裁减以一九五五年一月一日军备和武装部队的水平为起算点，拨款的削减以一九五五年军事需要拨款的水平为起算点。在上述时期内，应该做到完全禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，以及停止生产这种武器，从各国的军备中完全取消这种武器，使原子物质只用于和平目的。
    鉴于完全禁止原子武器和氢武器具有异常重要的意义，苏联的建议规定，上述关于这种武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器的措施的彻底实现，不得迟于按照一致同意的定额裁减另一半军备和武装部队的措施的完成。在军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款开始再削减一致同意的定额的余下的百分之五十时，就应该立即停止原子武器和氢武器的生产。为了对各国遵守上述公约的情况进行必要的国际监督，规定建立永久性的国际监督机构，这一机构应该在开始实施规定在这一阶段实施的裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施的同时，开始执行自己的责任。
    苏联政府的建议直接指出，这种国际机构所实行的监督，包括在永久性基础上实行视察在内，应当达到为保证一切国家履行它们根据公约所承担的义务所必需的程度。
    此外，苏联政府的建议指出，国际监督机构将在所有公约缔约国内经常驻有视察员，他们在他们的监督职权范围内，可以随时毫不受阻挠地视察一切监督的对象。
    建议规定，将吸收根据国际原则挑选出来的人员参加视察工作，这也将有助于这一机构有效地履行自己的职权。
    三、苏联的出发点是，在公约所规定的上述措施完成以后，重要的是各国应继续致力于进一步裁减军备。根据这一点，建议公约直接指出，各国将自己的军备和武装部队进一步裁减到为维护国内安全和履行联合国宪章加予它们的义务所绝对必需的水平是适宜的。
    由此可见，苏联的建议包含关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器问题的国际公约的基本原则，并且指出实施相应措施的顺序，从限制军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款开始，作为走向裁减各国军备和武装部队的第一个步骤。
    必须着重指出，苏联三月十八日的建议以及上述一九五四年六月十一日的法英建议规定，这些措施最初只涉及常规军备，直到各国的军备和武装部队缩减了在谈判中一致协议的定额的一半时为止。
      苏联和以往一样，认为为了巩固国际和平和消除原子战争威胁，必须立刻无条件地禁止原子武器和氢武器以及从军备中取消这种武器。但是，大家知道，由于美国、英国和法国三国政府采取的立场，还没有能就这个问题达成协议；这三个国家的政府在种种借口下反对这个建议，虽然这个建议是符合各国人民日益强烈的关于禁止原子武器和氢武器从而消除毁灭性的原子战争威胁的要求的。上述西方国家的政府在裁军小组委员会谈判过程中也不同意苏联政府在伦敦会谈开始时所提出的关于销毁各国现在储存的原子武器和氢武器、使原子物质仅用于和平目的的建议，虽然就这个问题达成协议就能促进就完全禁止原子武器以及有关裁减军备的其他问题达成协议。
    苏联政府三月十八日的建议规定开始只采取裁减常规军备的措施，这就便于达成必要的谅解，因为在法英建议中也是这样规定的。
    苏联提出的关于大量裁减五大国军备的建议的意义是难以估计的。
    这一建议的必要性和迫切性是显而易见的，因为这些大国裁减军备和武装部队是有决定性的意义的，只要不把“大量裁减”理解为像西方国家所企图做的那样，即只把它当作是宣言，而在实际上规避把军备作这样的裁减。
    对苏联提出的关于禁止原子武器和氢武器的建议，也应说同样的话。这一建议规定：第一、在开始裁减一致同意的定额的余下的百分之五十的军备的时候，就应该立刻停止制造原子武器和氢武器；第二、完全禁止这种武器不应该无限期拖延，而是不得迟于在一致同意的定额范围内裁减常规军备措施完成的时候。不难看出，在这一点上达成协议对巩固和平是有重大意义的。
    前面已经指出，苏联的建议强调对于执行裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器的各项措施进行国际监督的重要性，特别强调对这一工作进行视察的作用。这应该可以使所谓苏联不愿意建立国际监督来监督各国对国际公约的义务的执行情况的种种臆测停止了。
    同时还必须着重指出苏联关于在一九五五年召开关于普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的世界会议、以便实施裁减军备的进一步措施的建议的重要意义。召开有各国广泛参加的、讨论各国人民所深切关怀的问题的这个会议，对于巩固国际安全会有重大的意义。召开这样的会议就使所有的国家，无论是大国还是小国，都有可能积极参加讨论世界各国人民所切身相关的问题。
    因此，苏联的建议为苏联和西方国家之间取得一致的意见提供了良好的基础。这些建议，如果被采纳，就能保证恰当地解决裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器问题，从而也就能恰当地解决消除新的世界大战的威胁问题。
    所有这一切说明，三月十八日苏联政府的建议是苏联对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的又一个重要的贡献。
    问：你能不能谈谈美国、英国、法国和加拿大代表在小组委员会讨论苏联建议的时候采取了什么样的态度，以及你对他们的态度有什么看法？这个问题之所以引起兴趣，还因为西方国家某些报纸对小组委员会在这方面的情况同样做了显然是片面的报道。
    答：首先必须指出，当苏联二月二十五日向小组委员会提出的主张销毁各国现在储存的原子武器和氢武器以及限制各国的军备、武装部队和军事拨款以作为裁减军备和武装部队的第一个步骤的建议提交讨论时，美国、英国和法国的代表反对苏联这些建议，并且同时要求迅速转入讨论苏联政府关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器的公约的建议。大家知道，苏联也曾经把这个公约的主要原则提交给联合国大会最近一届会议讨论过。后来，当小组委员会开始讨论苏联政府三月十八日提出的关于缔结上述公约的建议时，西方国家的代表又开始寻找各种借口来反对这些建议。
    刚一开始讨论苏联的建议时就可以看出，西方国家的代表竭力企图回避讨论关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器的措施的问题，而只是想讨论国际监督的问题。苏联代表曾经提醒他们注意，苏联的建议规定必须建立有效的国际监督，因此，大家的任务就是要就裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施本身达成协议，而西方国家的代表却总是暗示讨论这些问题应当列为次要的事。
    这就可以明显地看出，总的说来他们也是企图设法破坏在国际监督方面达成协议的。关于这一点，首先可以从他们提出的一个要求中看出来，他们要求在建立监督时，不要考虑在裁减军备和禁止原子武器方面所采取的措施的性质，他们想在公约中规定建立一个永久性的国际监督机构，这个机构除其他权力外，在第一阶段，即尚未实施禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施的时候，就拥有视察权。这种愿望是不难识破的，因为在这种愿望的后面隐藏着一种打算，就是要建立一种片面的、不涉及原子武器和氢武器这种最危险的武器的监督。这当然是无法同意的。
    我们曾经问：西方国家是否同意在开始实施裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器的措施的同时永久性的监督机构开始工作；西方国家代表断然说，他们不同意这样做，因而他们又一次表明了，他们之所以把监督问题提到首要地位，是为了阻挠在监督问题上以及在应该在监督下实施的措施的问题上达成协议。这就使我们有理由作出一个结论：他们实际上是不愿意认真地讨论关于裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题。
    同时还应当谈一谈西方国家在五大国大量裁减军备和武装部队以及裁减军备的定额问题上所采取的态度。在口头上，它们的代表表示同意五大国大量裁减军备。但是，到具体讨论这个问题的时候就可以看出来，他们完全没有打算要大量裁减军备。这一点的最好证明就是，他们企图用关于军备和武装部队的水平的问题来代替关于裁减军备和武装部队的一致同意的定额的问题，据他们自己承认，这样一来，在某种情况下甚至可以有理由提出关于增加武装部队和军备的问题。在这方面，他们对关于五大国削减军备、武装部队和预算拨款的三分之一、并且把这个数目作为一致同意的定额的建议所采取的态度，是十分值得注意的。西方国家的代表断然地表示反对这个建议。
    西方国家的代表竭力避免对裁减军备和禁止原子武器措施的实施明确规定期限。
    例如，英国代表力图证明，似乎完全没有必要把关于执行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的期限的条款列入公约。例如，西方国家代表一面大谈关于裁减武装部队力量的期限，同时他们实际上又主张把期限问题的解决留给监督机构处理，明白地说，也就是他们想避而不谈期限问题。
    不待说，这个公约如果既不指明在什么期限内应当完成裁减常规军备的措施，也不指明在什么期限内应当实现禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施，那末它是不会有多大价值的。
    直到现在，美国、英国、法国和加拿大的代表还是不顾苏联的坚持主张，没有表示愿意仔细地讨论苏联政府关于禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施的建议。在这个问题上，他们直到现在仅限于发表一般性的意见，就是说，把关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的一切措施的命运都取决于是否接受他们的关于监督问题的观点。
    即使根据上面关于西方国家对苏联建议所抱的态度所讲的这些，也就足以作出结论，是谁真正在为裁军小组委员会的工作制造困难。
    此外，引人注意的还有这样一个事实：恰巧就在裁军小组委员会开始工作的时候，西方国家的政治家大叫大嚷，这些国家的报纸也加紧宣传，要大力扩充军备，特别是扩充原子武器和氢武器军备，并且反对禁止这些武器。这个事实也说明，当苏联竭力促进就裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器问题达成必要的协议，从而促进和缓国际紧张局势和消除新战争威胁的时候，西方国家却继续奉行加紧扩充军备的政策，这是同联合国大会关于责成小组委员会寻求可能、以便就裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器问题达成必要的协议的决定相违背的。
    至于苏联，它在小组委员会的代表今后仍将促进就这个重要问题达成必要的协议。
