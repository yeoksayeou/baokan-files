Healthy and Simple Music and Dance
—Introducing the Workers' Performances in the Mass Amateur Music Performance and Exhibition
Zhu Shulan

The mass amateur music and dance performance and exhibition for workers was held in the capital from February 23rd to March 3rd. This performance and exhibition took place after the joint issuance of the "Instructions on Strengthening Cultural and Artistic Work in Factories, Mines, Construction Sites, and Enterprises" by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in June 1954, which led to the further development of extensive amateur artistic activities among workers. According to incomplete statistics from cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dalian, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and the China Railway Trade Union system, there are currently 2,867 amateur art organizations involving drama, music, and dance, with over 75,000 workers regularly participating in performances. The 207 worker-performers who participated in this performance and exhibition are all active members of these activities. Their 107 programs were also selected from over 16,700 worker-performers performing over 1,790 programs recommended by grassroots organizations or from performance and exhibitions in various regions and units. As a result of the performance and exhibition evaluation, 43 programs received excellent awards, 35 programs received awards, and another 18 programs received verbal commendations. These performances demonstrated the artistic talents of the broad masses of workers.

The content of the programs performed by the worker masses was quite rich: some praised the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the soldiers defending the motherland; some praised labor; some sang about peace; some expressed the joyful emotions of the people's happy life. The artistic forms of the performances were also diverse. In terms of vocal music, there were solo, duet, ensemble, and small chorus; instrumental solos included erhu, transverse flute, pipa, and guzheng, as well as accordion and piano, and folk music ensembles. The dances included not only Chinese ethnic and folk dances and Soviet folk dances, but also dances created and performed by the workers themselves that reflected real life. For example, the "Loading and Unloading Dance" collectively created by the railway workers' art group of the Dalian East Station Loading and Unloading Supply Station was full of genuine emotion and healthy dance movements, combined with the vigorous loading and unloading work chants, showing the working class's spirit of courageous advancement. The "Textile Workers' Dance" performed by female textile workers in Shanghai made the audience deeply feel that labor is a pleasant thing, and labor itself is a beautiful dance. The "Celebration Dance" created and performed by female workers of the Guangzhou No. 2 Textile Factory also simply expressed their precious feelings of love and respect for labor models. Among the folk dances, the "Lion Dance" performed by the Shenyang team showed the lion's brave character and majestic spirit, symbolizing the great strength of the people. The Yunnan Flower Lantern "Ten Sisters" performed by the Chongqing team is a form of singing and dancing loved by the broad masses. It delicately portrayed the pure hearts of ten tea-picking girls, their mutual care, and their beautiful aspirations for future life. The "Butterfly Catching Dance" performed by the railway team was lively and humorous, vividly depicting the innocent psychology of children and full of strong local flavor. From all the dance programs performed, we can see that various ethnic dances have been widely spread among the workers, and have been mastered by many amateur worker-dancers. For example, the Uyghur dance "Cotton Picking Dance" performed by Qi Lan, the Korean dance "Chailang and Village Girl" performed by Dong Minzhi and Cai Xiuming, the Kazakh dance performed by Li Zhimei, the "Tibetan Herdsman Dance" performed by Li Pingmin and others, and the Mongolian "Herdsman Dance" performed by Liu Yongze and others all had a certain level of dance technique and expressed the styles of various ethnic groups. The Korean folk dance "Laundry Dance" performed by Jin Mingzi and others of the Korean ethnic group, and the classical dance "Ne Zha Conquers the Dragon King" performed by Shanghai workers, all gave the audience a good impression.

The music part of the performance and exhibition showed the vocal and instrumental talents of the worker masses. Their performances were full of genuine emotion. They selected lively and concise performance forms, such as the duet "Ding Ding Dang" performed by Ma Xiliang and Chen Jingxue of Shenyang, which was extremely infectious; the "Heroic Automobile Driver" performed by Wang Yuanzhen and others of Shanghai, whose singing was full of emotion, expressing the heroic driver's fearless optimism; the female chorus "By the Spring" by the Dalian team and the "Twelve Sickles" duet by the railway team both had strong local characteristics. Solo singing, solo instrumental performance, and instrumental ensemble performances also had a certain level of skill.

The reason why these amateur worker-performers achieved such results is, on the one hand, due to their own diligent study. For example, Guo Chunying, a female worker at the Tianjin Hengyuan Textile Factory, had a low level of education and had not studied the basic knowledge of vocal music. Because she loved music, she often learned by following the radio's singing instructions and records, gradually improving her singing ability. Her performance of "Grandma Wang Wants Peace" won an excellent award. On the other hand, it is also related to the guidance and assistance of professional art groups and artists. The song and dance "Ten Sisters", the folk dance "Butterfly Catching Dance", and the classical dance "Ne Zha Conquers the Dragon King" could reach such a performance level thanks to the guidance of professional artists. At the same time, most of them participated in amateur art schools and short-term training courses held by local cultural bureaus and other relevant departments, or were members of local worker amateur art groups.

During the performance and exhibition, activities such as seminars for worker amateur art work cadres, seminars for performers, and interviews with performers were also held, reflecting the problems existing in the current worker amateur art activities, such as the lack of attention from grassroots leading organs, the emergence of certain undesirable tendencies in mass art activities, and the lack of singing materials, etc. These problems should be paid attention to by relevant leading departments.

    健康朴素的音乐舞蹈
    ——介绍群众业余音乐观摩演出会职工部分的演出
    朱树兰
    群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出职工部分，二月二十三日到三月三日在首都举行。这次观摩演出是在一九五四年六月中央人民政府文化部，中华全国总工会联合发布的“关于加强厂矿、工地、企业中文化艺术工作的指示”后，广大的职工业余艺术活动有了进一步开展的基础上进行的。根据广州、上海、旅大、沈阳、天津、武汉等市和中国铁路工会系统的不完全统计，目前已有戏剧、音乐、舞蹈等业余艺术组织二千八百六十七个，经常参加演出的职工有七万五千多人。参加这次观摩演出的二百○七个职工演员，都是这些活动的积极分子，他们演出的一百○七个节目，也是经过基层的推荐或从各地区、单位观摩演出的一万六千七百多个职工演员演出的一千七百九十多个节目中挑选出来的。观摩演出会评选的结果，有四十三个节目获得优秀奖，三十五个节目获得奖励，另有十八个节目得到口头表扬。这些表演，显示了广大职工群众的艺术才能。
    职工群众观摩演出节目的内容是相当丰富的：有的歌颂了共产党、毛主席和保卫祖国的战士；有的颂扬了劳动；有的歌唱了和平；有的表现了人民幸福生活的愉快情绪。演出的艺术形式也是多种多样的。声乐方面有：独唱、对唱、重唱、小合唱；器乐的独奏有二胡、横笛、琵琶、古筝外，还有手风琴和钢琴，以及民间音乐合奏。舞蹈不仅有我国各族、民间舞蹈和苏联民间舞，更有工人们自己创作和演出的反映现实生活的舞蹈。如大连东站装卸供应站铁路工人文艺小组集体创作的“装卸舞”，充满了真实感情和健康的舞蹈动作，结合着雄浑的装卸号子，显示了工人阶级勇往直前的精神。上海纺织女工演出的“纺织工人舞”，使观众深深地感到劳动是愉快的事情，劳动本身就是美丽的舞蹈。广州纺织二厂女工创作和演出的“庆功舞”，也朴素地表达了她们爱戴劳动模范的珍贵感情。民间舞蹈中，像沈阳代表队演出的“狮子舞”，表现了狮子的勇猛的性格和雄伟的气魄，象征着人民的伟大力量。重庆代表队演出的云南花灯“十大姐”，是广大群众爱好的载歌载舞的形式，它细致地刻划了十个采茶姑娘的纯洁心情、她们的互相关切和对未来生活的美好想望。铁路代表队表演的“捕蝶舞”，生动活泼，诙谐地描绘了儿童的天真心理和富有浓厚的乡土风味。从演出的全部舞蹈节目里，我们可以看到多种民族舞蹈已在职工群众中普遍流传，并为不少职工业余舞蹈演员所掌握。如齐兰表演的维吾尔族舞蹈“采棉舞”，董敏芝、蔡秀茗表演的朝鲜舞蹈“柴郎与村女”，李志梅表演的哈萨克族舞蹈，李平敏等表演的“藏族牧人舞”，和刘涌泽等表演的蒙古“牧人舞”等，都具有一定水平的舞蹈技巧，表现了各民族的风格。朝鲜族金明子等表演的本族民间舞“洗衣舞”，上海工人演出的古典舞“哪吒闹海”，都给观众良好的印象。
    观摩演出的音乐部分，显示了职工群众中声乐和器乐的才能。他们的表演充满着真实的感情。他们选取了活泼、精悍的演唱形式，如沈阳马希良、陈景学的对唱“叮叮噹”，极富有感染力；上海王元贞等表演的“英雄的汽车司机员”，演唱的情绪饱满、表现了英雄司机员那种奋不顾身的乐观主义精神；旅大代表队的女声重唱“放风筝”、铁路代表队的“十二把镰刀”对唱，都有着较浓的地方色彩。独唱、独奏和器乐合奏等表演，也都有一定的技巧水平。
    这些职工群众业余演员的表演所以得到这样的成绩，一方面是由于他们自己的刻苦钻研，例如天津恒源纺织厂的女工郭春英，文化水平不高，没有学过声乐的基本知识，因为喜爱音乐，经常跟着电台的教唱和唱片学习，逐渐提高了演唱能力。她演唱的“王大妈要和平”获得了优秀奖。另一方面，也和专业文艺团体和文艺工作者的辅导和帮助有关。歌舞“十大姐”、民间舞“捕蝶舞”、古典舞“哪吒闹海”等能达到这样的表演水平，是跟专业文艺工作者的辅导分不开的。同时，他们大多参加过当地文化局等有关部门举办的业余艺术学校、短期训练班，或者是当地工人业余文艺活动团体的成员。
    观摩演出期间，还进行了职工业余文艺工作干部座谈会、演员座谈会、演员访问等活动，反映了目前职工业余文艺活动中存在的问题，如基层领导机关对此不够重视、群众文艺活动中出现了某些不良倾向、演唱材料太少等等。这些问题，应该引起有关领导部门的重视。（附图片）
