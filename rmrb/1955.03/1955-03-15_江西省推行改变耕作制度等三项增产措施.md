Jiangxi Province is promoting measures such as changing cropping systems and expanding multiple cropping areas to strive to exceed the province's grain production plan for this year. The leading organs of Jiangxi Province have summarized local production experience and believe that changing single-season rice to double-season rice, changing intermediate rice to early rice, and changing dry land to paddy fields are important ways to greatly increase grain production in Jiangxi Province in the future. The province's temperature and rainfall are suitable, and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has provided favorable conditions for this change. According to statistics, this year the province has about 1.4 million mu of single-season rice that can be converted to double-season rice, more than 200,000 mu of intermediate rice that can be converted to early rice, and more than 90,000 mu of dry land that can be converted to paddy fields. These three measures alone can increase grain production by more than 420 million jin in the province this year. At present, farmers are carrying out tasks such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation to create material conditions for this change. Ji'an, Shangrao, Fuzhou and other special districts have completed more than 31,000 small-scale water conservancy projects, which can irrigate more than 1.2 million mu of farmland. Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places have taken the lead in promoting these three reform measures. More than 3,200 agricultural production cooperatives in the Gannan District have all established change plans. Twelve agricultural production cooperatives in Nanxi Township, Seventh District of Nanchang County, used more than 1,000 workers to repair 35 large and small water conservancy projects, which not only guaranteed the water source for changing single-season rice to double-season rice, but also enhanced the drought resistance capacity of 1,200 mu of paddy fields.

    江西省推行改变耕作制度等三项增产措施
    江西省农民积极采取改变耕作制度和扩大复种面积等措施，争取超额完成今年全省粮食增产计划。江西省领导机关总结了当地生产经验，认为：变一季稻为双季稻；变中稻为早稻；变旱地为水田是江西省今后大量增产粮食的重要途径。省内气温和雨量适宜，特别是互助合作运动的发展都给这种改变提供了有利条件。据统计，今年全省约有一百四十多万亩一季稻可变为双季稻，二十多万亩中稻变为早稻，九万多亩旱地变为水田。仅这三项措施，全省今年即可增产四亿二千多万斤粮食。目前，农民正在进行兴修水利、积肥等工作，为这种改变创造物质条件。吉安、上饶、抚州等专区已完成小型水利工程三万一千多座，能灌田一百二十多万亩。各地互助合作组织更带头推行了这三项改革措施。赣南区三千二百多个农业生产合作社都订立了改变计划。南昌县七区南溪乡十二个农业生产合作社，用了一千多个人工，修整大小水利工程三十五处，除保证单季稻变双季稻的水源外，并使一千二百亩水田增强了抗旱能力。
