Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 5th: Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops presented a disgusting and embarrassing scene when they retreated from the Nanji Islands. Dashao Ao was the departure point for the Chiang bandit troops' retreat from the island. When retreating, the Chiang bandit troops burned this village of more than thirty households into a scorched black ruin. On the square west of Dashao Ao, various military supplies that the Chiang bandit troops did not have time to take away were piled up, including thousands of bags of cement and hundreds of bundles of lead wire, as well as barbed wire used to build auxiliary defensive fortifications. The south side of the square was piled full of wooden and iron stakes for pulling wire fences, and the southwest corner was full of gasoline drums and galvanized iron sheets marked with American symbols, as well as roof frames, glass, screws, and two to three hundred boxes of materials for building prefabricated houses. There were also hundreds of boxes of dry food with the words "Carry Rations" printed on them, which the enemy had prepared to eat on the road. On the large beach three to four hundred meters east of the square, white crushed biscuits, paper-wrapped noodles soaked into a paste by the sea water, military cotton-padded clothes, quilts, iron shovels, picks, and various canned goods, oil bottles, and wine bottles were scattered. Chiang bandit troops' military caps were also floating on the sea water.

On the road leading to the pier, various shells, bullets, and grenades abandoned by the Chiang bandit troops were scattered in a mess. Straw mats for sleeping, fire extinguishers, radios, transceivers, and life jackets, as well as artillery aiming poles and observation telescopes, were also thrown around on the pier. They dared not wait for the tide to rise to sail away from a stranded landing craft, but hurriedly blew it up with explosives. Nearby were also the remains of several anti-aircraft guns and four anti-aircraft guns. On one anti-aircraft gun whose barrel had been blown off, explosives and detonators prepared to destroy other parts were placed, but the fuse had not been lit.

In their panic-stricken escape, the Chiang bandit troops also hastily destroyed many supplies. Some of the gasoline that the Chiang bandit troops did not have time to take away had their oil drums blown up, while others had holes drilled in the oil drums, causing the gasoline to leak out. The Chiang bandit troops also dumped a large amount of soybean oil into a large pit with an area of about thirty square meters west of Dashao Ao.

The People of Jinmen Island are Living in Deep Water
According to Xinhua News Agency: The people of Jinmen Island on the Fujian coast are trapped in a difficult situation where they have no houses to live in and no food to eat under the exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The 50,000 people on Jinmen Island mostly live on agriculture, fishing, and remittances from overseas Chinese. The Chiang bandit troops not only requisitioned many farmlands to build fortifications and barracks, but also seized a large amount of civilian land. Some companies of Chiang bandit troops occupied as many as twenty acres of civilian land. Many young and middle-aged fishermen and farmers were captured by the Chiang bandit troops to serve as cannon fodder. The lives of fishermen on the island are also extremely difficult under the exploitation and oppression of the Chiang bandit troops. Half of the fish and shrimp caught by the fishermen are forcibly purchased by the Chiang bandit troops, and the price paid is only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the market price. Taiwan newspapers admitted that the residents of Jinmen Island often "have no grain to last overnight." Most residents live on sweet potato residue all year round, and only eat sweet potato flour during the New Year and festivals. As for rice, it is rarely eaten. According to Taiwan newspapers, in 1954, the people of the entire island were short of 3.7 million catties of grain.

About 6,000 people on Jinmen Island work abroad, and the families of these overseas Chinese are the targets of exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The money remitted by overseas Chinese to their families is exchanged for counterfeit Taiwan dollars by the branches of Chiang bandit banks at the so-called "official price," causing great losses to the families of overseas Chinese. The Chiang bandits also make endless extortions from the families of overseas Chinese in the name of "donations for the military," "donations for building memorial towers," and "donations for building pavilions and terraces."

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique monopolizes the commercial trade of Jinmen Island and runs so-called "welfare societies" and other institutions for distributing supplies, exploiting the residents of the island. Everything on Jinmen Island is more expensive than in Taiwan. Pork prices are twice as expensive as the market price in Taiwan, and cigarettes are two to three times more expensive. Medicines are especially expensive, with a common dysentery pill costing the equivalent of five catties of rice.

    蒋贼军从南麂山列岛撤逃时的狼狈相
    【新华社浙江前线五日电】蒋贼军从南麂山列岛撤逃时现出一幅可憎的狼狈相。大沙岙是岛上蒋贼军撤逃时的起航点。蒋贼军在撤逃时把这个有三十多户居民的村庄烧成一片焦黑色的灰烬。在大沙岙西面的广场上堆积着蒋贼军来不及带走的各种军用物资，几千袋水泥和几百捆铅丝及修筑附防御工事用的铁蒺藜等。广场南面堆满了拉铁丝网用的木桩和铁桩，西南角上全部是标有美国标志的汽油桶和白铁皮、屋架、玻璃、螺丝钉等，以及建筑活动房子用的二、三百箱子材料。还有敌人准备在路上吃的印有“携带口粮”字样的好几百箱干粮。在广场东面三、四百公尺方圆的大沙滩上，散弃着白色的碎饼干、被海水泡成了浆糊的纸筒装的挂面和军用棉衣、棉被、铁锹、洋镐以及各种罐头、油瓶、酒瓶等。海水上还漂浮着蒋贼军的军帽。
    在通向码头的公路上，狼藉着蒋贼军遗弃的各种炮弹、子弹、手榴弹。码头上还乱扔着睡觉用的草席和灭火机、收音机、收发报机、救生衣，以及炮兵瞄准用的标杆、观察用的炮对镜等。一艘搁浅了的登陆艇，他们也不敢等到涨潮时开走，而急忙用炸药把它炸毁了。在这附近还有好几门机关炮的残骸和四门高射炮，在一门炮身已经炸断的高射炮上，放着准备炸毁其他部分的炸药和雷管还没有拉火。
    蒋贼军在狼狈逃命时还怱促地破坏了许多物资。蒋贼军来不及带走的汽油，有的把油桶炸毁了，有的把油桶凿了洞，使汽油漏光了。蒋贼军还把大量的豆油，全部倾倒在大沙岙西面面积约有三十平方公尺一个大坑里。
    金门岛人民在水深火热中
    据新华社讯：福建沿海金门岛人民在蒋介石卖国集团的压榨下，陷于居无屋、食无粮的困苦境地。
    金门岛上五万人民，大部分靠农业、渔业和华侨汇款为生。蒋贼军在岛上不但征用了许多耕地来构筑工事、修建营房，并且霸占了大量民田。蒋贼军中有的一个连霸占的民田就多达二十多亩。许多青、壮年渔民和农民被蒋贼军抓去充当炮灰。岛上渔民在蒋贼军剥削压迫下生活也困苦不堪。渔民们捕获的鱼虾，其中一半被蒋贼军强迫收购，所付的价钱只等于市价的十分之一、二。台湾报纸承认，金门岛上居民们常常是“粮无隔宿”。大多数居民终年以番薯渣糊口，只有过年过节才吃番薯粉，至于大米更是很少吃到。据台湾报纸报道，在一九五四年，全岛人民共缺粮三百七十万市斤。
    金门岛上约有六千人在国外谋生，这些华侨的眷属都是蒋介石卖国集团敲榨盘剥的对象。华侨汇给眷属的款项，由蒋贼银行的分支机构按照所谓“官价”兑给伪台币，使华侨眷属受到很大损失。蒋贼还以“捐献劳军”、“捐建纪念塔”、“捐建亭台”等等名目，对华侨眷属作层出不穷的勒索。
    蒋介石卖国集团垄断了金门岛的商业贸易，开办所谓“福利社”等配销物资的机构，盘剥岛上居民。金门岛百物都比台湾昂贵，猪肉价格比台湾市价贵一倍，香烟贵两三倍。药品尤其贵得惊人，一颗普通的痢疾药丸，价值五斤大米。
