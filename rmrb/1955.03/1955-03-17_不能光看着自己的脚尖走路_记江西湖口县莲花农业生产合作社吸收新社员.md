"You Can't Just Look at Your Toes When Walking"
    ——On the Lotus Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hukou County, Jiangxi Province, Absorbing New Members
    Sun Zunian, Zhang Zizhong

    Poor peasant Liu Longjiao had submitted his application to join the cooperative to Director Zhou Yuegui two days prior. Fearing the director was too busy and might forget, one deep winter night, he ran to the director's house and said, "When my application to join the cooperative is discussed at the members' meeting, please say a few good words for me!"

    Faced with such soaring enthusiasm from the masses outside the cooperative wanting to join, the director felt even happier than if someone had praised him ten times over. He greeted the members with a beaming smile: "Comrades! Another fourteen households are single-mindedly determined to join the cooperative! The cooperative will hold a meeting in a few days to discuss welcoming them in."

    However, the members' reactions were lukewarm, and many disagreed with absorbing new members.

    One day, member Zhou Zihe came to talk to the director on behalf of some members.

    "Is the cooperative really going to expand?"

    "Of course, it's going to expand. We now have the conditions to expand..."

    At this point, Zhou Zihe's face showed displeasure, and he blurted out:

    "That won't do! We've worked ourselves to the bone for a year, and now they see the cooperative has over 5 million yuan (old currency) in public accumulation funds and has reclaimed more than 80 mu of wasteland, so they want to come?"

    "No, their request to join now shows their socialist consciousness has increased."

    "What 'increased socialist consciousness,' isn't it just envy!"

    The director sensed his tone was wrong and wanted to patiently persuade him; but before he could speak, Zihe said angrily, "No matter how you say it, we who joined the cooperative first have suffered a loss, and they (the farmers applying to join) have benefited." After saying this, he turned and left without even looking back.

    The cooperative affairs committee held a meeting to discuss this issue. At the meeting, Zhou Yuegui said, "In the past, the transition from mutual aid teams to cooperatives was very smooth, but now we're encountering such difficulties in expanding the cooperative. If we act according to Zihe's and others' feelings, many farmers who want to join will be shut out. If we don't do well this time, it will not only be bad for our cooperative but also have a negative impact on the future expansion of surrounding cooperatives. We must overcome this difficulty and fight against this conservative and selfish individualism." The committee members agreed with the director's opinion and decided to persuade and educate the members whose thinking was not clear.

    Whether to absorb or not absorb new members, the debate in the cooperative became increasingly sharp. Before this, the cadres of the cooperative had not adequately estimated the emotions of the members and were not sufficiently ideologically prepared. When faced with these practical problems, they only talked about grand principles like "the general line" and "socialism," and did not know how to educate the members with practical and concrete examples. Therefore, the ideological problems of old members such as Zihe, Weirao, Zixi, and Yunkang, who disagreed with absorbing new members, could not be resolved.

    At this time, Weirao came up with a new idea: "It's okay to join the cooperative, but the 5 million yuan in public accumulation funds and the more than 80 mu of reclaimed wasteland in the cooperative must be divided among the old members as our public accumulation funds, and then the new members must also bring the same amount of public accumulation funds to join the cooperative." Zihe and Zixi also said that this was "fair and reasonable."

    The problem became more and more complicated. The director and several committee members studied the issue: since the members were all discussing this matter, it would be better to simply hold a members' meeting and let everyone seriously discuss it once.

    At the members' meeting, the director again spoke about the significance of absorbing new members; before he had finished half of his speech, member Zhou Zixi shook his head with impatience and said, "It won't work! Isn't this hitting your head against a wall? Director, don't you know that the members don't agree!" Zihe sneered and added, "'We must take the road of cooperativization,' 'We must lead the farmers to join agricultural cooperatives,' I can also say that! I ask you, why didn't they join when we went to their doors again and again in February 1953 when the mutual aid team was transformed into a cooperative; now, humph! Isn't it obvious that they are coming to enjoy the fruits of our labor? We cannot agree."

    The meeting ended on an unhappy note.

    At this time, the room was quiet, without a sound. Deputy Director Zhou Shixin and Production Committee Member Zhou Cheng'an squatted by the table with their heads propped on their hands, frowning. Director Zhou Yuegui stood by the window, staring blankly at the dark sky. He was thinking of what County Party Secretary Li had said: "Don't be impatient; the farmers' selfishness and individualism are the result of thousands of years of the old society; patiently tell the members that happy days must be created by everyone. In our work, we must rely on the poor peasants, closely unite the middle peasants, and jointly take the road of cooperativization. This is the glorious task of rural Communist Party members..."

    Thinking of this, his mind seemed to open, and he suddenly turned around and said loudly to the committee members present, "Don't be discouraged, comrades! It's not something that can be said in a few words to defeat the individualistic thinking of only caring about personal life and not caring about the lives of the majority of farmers; it requires hard work. Now we must change our approach and patiently persuade everyone with concrete facts."

    They went to the members' homes separately, focusing on doing individual work.

    One day, just after dinner, Zihe was sitting in the room smoking when suddenly the director and deputy director arrived. He casually grabbed a stool and asked with a smile, "What's the matter? Director." Yuegui and Shixin sat down close to Zihe and said cordially, "It's nothing else, we still want to chat with you about the expansion of the cooperative."

    "I don't think you should waste your efforts!" Zihe said with a wry smile.

    "Zihe, I don't think your thinking is right. You can't just care about your own good life after joining the cooperative and not see the difficulties of the majority of farmers outside the cooperative. All the farmers in the world are one family!"

    "Then you tell me, is it wrong for the new members to bring public accumulation funds?"

    "Zihe, think about it, some mutual aid teams and individual farmers suffered from floods and pests in 1954, their income was reduced, and their lives are still very difficult. How can they afford to bring a lot of money to supplement the public accumulation funds? Isn't it obvious that you don't want others to join the cooperative? To build socialism, do we rely on the majority of working people or the minority? If they can't join the cooperative and don't have the conditions to organize other cooperatives, their lives will not only continue to be impoverished, but it will also be detrimental to the country's industrialization."

    Zihe knew very well the income situation of the cooperative, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers in 1954. After listening to the director's words, he felt it made a lot of sense. He thought that the agricultural cooperative sold two or three times more cotton and grain to the state in 1954 than the farmers outside the cooperative. If all the farmers in the village joined the cooperative, production would continue to increase, socialism would come faster, and the income of the old members would also increase more. Zihe also praised the director's heartfelt words: "That's right!"

    However, he still couldn't forget the existing public accumulation funds in the cooperative.

    "If they can't afford it, we'll just divide the public accumulation funds and reorganize, wouldn't that work?"

    "What if people want to join the cooperative every year in the future? Can we divide the public accumulation funds every year? The agricultural cooperative is to expand step by step on the original basis and move forward step by step. How can the agricultural cooperative develop like you said! The output of the agricultural cooperative must be higher year by year, what do we rely on? Buying plows and cattle, farm tools, buying fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects all depend on everyone's labor and accumulating public accumulation funds!"

    "They refused to participate at all when the cooperative was built in the past; now they see that we have more reclaimed wasteland, so they want to come. What kind of thinking is this?"

    "Farmers are people who believe what they see. In the past, some people didn't believe it when there were no agricultural cooperatives established in the township; now that they see that agricultural cooperatives have really increased their income, they want to join, and we should welcome them. Zihe, we are members of the agricultural cooperative! Don't just look at your toes when walking!"

    "Then what about our reclaimed wasteland?" Zihe asked anxiously.

    "We will grow wheat in those fields, and sell it to the state after harvest. If the income from the fields exceeds the production investment, the new and old members will share it together; if it is insufficient, we will also share the burden together. When the cooperative expands and there is more labor, we can cultivate these fields better."

    Zihe agreed to absorbing poor peasants into the cooperative; however, he still didn't understand the idea of absorbing middle peasants into the cooperative, especially disapproving of middle peasant Zhou Yuanmo joining the cooperative. He said, "When the cooperative was built the year before last, he relied on his good land, complete farm tools, strong cattle, and strong labor force. He was afraid that the poor peasants would take advantage of him if he joined the cooperative. I don't want this kind of person to join the cooperative now."

    "Yuanmo has already reviewed this shortcoming in his application. If he has changed, we should welcome him. It is right to rely on the poor peasants, but it is also important to unite the middle peasants. Only when the poor and middle peasants are united can the agricultural cooperative be run well."

    Zihe also figured this out.

    Since adopting the working method of solving the members' ideological problems individually, it has had a great effect. The old members who previously disagreed with absorbing new members now all agreed. At another members' meeting, Zihe said to all the members in pain, "I was wrong, I forgot that before liberation, my whole family held empty stomachs every day, squatted in that broken house, ate pot-washing water, and my whole body was frozen like a red radish in winter. Now that I have joined the cooperative, my life is better, and I sleep at night covered with an eight-pound cotton quilt, I am satisfied. Seeing that there are some public accumulation funds in the cooperative, I was afraid that the new members would take advantage of it, and I didn't think about the principle of common prosperity and the good days of socialism. I was really looking at my toes when walking."

    At the end of 1954, the Lotus Agricultural Production Cooperative officially held a meeting to accept new members into the cooperative. On this day, the old members were as happy as if they were celebrating a happy event. As soon as middle peasant Zhou Yuanmo entered the room, Zihe enthusiastically shouted, "Yuanmo, come and sit here!" and immediately gave his seat to him. Yuanmo was very moved and said to Zihe cordially, "I used to be afraid that joining the cooperative would not increase production and that I would suffer losses. Now the more I think about it, the more I feel that I am backward. Zihe, you have joined the cooperative more than a year earlier! In the future, you must guide me in many things!" After saying this, Zihe also smiled and said:

    "In the future, we will all be members of the agricultural production cooperative, and we must help each other, learn from each other, and strive to run the cooperative well! This is a big deal."

    Nineteen poor and middle peasants have joined the Lotus Agricultural Production Cooperative, and the new and old members are jointly discussing the 1955 production plan and are actively carrying out various preparations to welcome the arrival of spring plowing production.

    “不能光看着自己的脚尖走路”
    ——记江西湖口县莲花农业生产合作社吸收新社员
    孙祖年　张自忠
    贫农刘龙姣把入社申请书交给社长周月桂已经两天了。他怕社长事多忘记，在一个深冬的夜晚，又跑到社长家里对社长说：“我申请入社的事，到社员大会上讨论时，你要帮我多说两句啊！”
    社长面对着社外群众要求入社这种高涨的情绪，心里比别人称赞自己十句还要高兴。他见着社员就笑呵呵地打招呼：“同志们！已经又有十四户农民一心要进社啦！几天社里就要开会讨论，欢迎他们进来。”
    可是，社员们的反映却很冷淡，许多人不同意吸收新社员。
    有一天，社员周子和代表一部分社员的意见来找社长谈话。
    “合作社真的要扩大吗？”
    “当然要扩大。现在我们社有了扩大的条件……”
    这时，周子和的脸上现出不高兴的样子，开口就说：
      “那怎么行啦！我们累死累活地干了一年，现在他们看到社里有了五百多万元（旧币，下同）公积金，开了八十多亩荒地，就想来？”
    “不，他们现在要求入社，是表现社会主义觉悟提高了。”
    “什么‘社会主义觉悟’提高了，还不是眼红！”
    社长听他的口气不对，想进行耐心说服；但话还未脱口，子和又气愤地说：“说破天，也是我们先入社的吃了亏，他们（申请入社的农民）占了便宜。”说完转身就走，连头也不回。
    社务委员会开会讨论了这个问题。在会上，周月桂说：“过去由互助组转社时还很顺利，现在扩大社倒碰到这样的困难。如果按照子和他们的情绪办事，许多要入社的农民就要被关在社外了。如果我们这次做不好，不但对我们这个社不好，对周围的合作社今后扩大也会有不好的影响。我们一定要克服这个困难，和这种保守自私的个人主义思想进行斗争。”委员们都同意社长的意见，决定对思想不通的社员进行说服教育。
    吸收还是不吸收新社员，社里的争论越来越尖锐了。在这以前，社里的干部们对社员中的这种情绪估计不够，思想准备不充分。碰到这些现实问题时，他们光讲些“总路线呀”“社会主义呀”等大道理，不会用实际具体事例教育社员。因此，子和、维饶、子溪、云康等老社员不同意吸收新社员的思想问题老是解决不了。
    这时，维饶又出了一个新主意：“进社也可以，那得把社里的五百万元公积金和八十多亩开荒地分给老社员每人一份，做为我们的公积金，然后新社员也带同样的公积金入社。”子和、子溪也说：这样做才“公平合理”。
    问题越来越复杂了。社长和几个委员研究：既然社员们都议论这件事，不如干脆开个社员大会，让大家认真地讨论一次。
    在社员大会上，社长又讲起吸收新社员的意义来了；还没有说完一半，社员周子溪就带着不耐烦的样子摇着头说：“不行啦！这不是拿着脑袋硬往墙上碰吗？社长，你还不知道社员们不同意么！”子和也冷笑了一声接着说：“‘要走合作化的道路’，‘要领导农民加入农业社’，我也会讲啊！我问你，为什么一九五三年二月互助组转社的时候，三番五次地上门动员，他们不入社；现在，哼！这不是明摆着来享受我们的劳动果实吗？我们是不能同意的。”
    这个会落了个不欢而散。
    这时，屋子里静静的一点声音都没有。副社长周时新，生产委员周成安双手撑着脑袋，皱着眉头蹲在桌边。社长周月桂站在窗前，呆呆地望着那漆黑的天，他在想县委李书记的话：“不要性急，农民的私有心和个人主义思想，是几千年的旧社会造成的；要耐心地告诉社员：幸福的日子要大家创造。在工作中，要依靠贫农，把中农团结紧，共同走合作化的道路。这是农村共产党员的光荣任务……”
    想到这里，思想像开了窍似的，他突然转过身来，对在座的社委们大声说：“不要泄气，同志们！要把只顾个人生活好、不顾大多数农民生活好的个人主义思想打退，不是一两句话就能说成的，要靠艰苦的工作。现在我们要转变方式，用具体事实耐心地去说服大家。”
    他们分头有重点地到社员家里去做个别工作了。
    有一天正吃罢晚饭，子和正坐在屋里抽烟，忽然社长和副社长来了。他随手拿了一张板凳，笑嘻嘻地问着：“有事吗？社长。”月桂和时新紧靠着子和坐下以后，亲切地说：“没别的事，还是想跟你扯一扯扩社的事。”
    “我看不要再白费心思啦！”子和苦笑着说了这一句。
    “子和，我看你这样想法不对头。不能光顾自己入了社生活好了，看不到多数社外农民的困难。天下农民是一家啊！”
    “那么你们说一说，让新社员拿公积金不对吗？”
    “子和，你想一想，一九五四年有的互助组和单干农民遭了水灾、虫灾，减了收入，生活还很困难，怎能带得起许多钱补公积金呢？这不是明摆着不让别人进社吗？建设社会主义要靠多数劳动人民，还是靠少数？他们不能入社，又没有条件另外组织合作社，这样不仅生活会贫困下去，就是对国家工业化也是不利的。”
    一九五四年社里、互助组、单干农民的收入情况，子和是一清二楚的。听了社长这一番话，觉得很有道理。他想到农业社一九五四年卖给国家的棉花、粮食，比社外农民多两三倍。若是全村农民都入了社，生产会不断增加，社会主义来得就快，老社员的收入也能更多地增加。社长那些合心坎的话，子和也赞了一声：“是啊！”
    可是，他还是念念不忘社里已有的公积金。
      “他们拿不起，我们就把公积金分掉，就算重新组织，不行吗？”
    “以后年年有人要求入社怎么办？能每年都把公积金分掉？农业社是要在原有基础上，一步步扩大，一步步前进的。像你说的那样，农业社怎么发展呢！农业社的产量要一年比一年高，靠什么呢？买耕牛、农具，买肥料，兴修水利，都得靠大家劳动，靠积累公积金啊！”
    “过去建社时，他们死活不参加；现在看到我们开荒地多了，就要来。这是什么思想？”
      “农民就是眼见为实的人。以往乡里没建立农业社，有些人还不相信；现在看到农业社真的增加了收入，要求进社，我们就该欢迎。子和，我们是农业社的社员呀！走路可不要光看脚尖哩！”
      “那我们的开荒地到底怎么办？”子和焦急地追问。
      “要在那些地里种麦子，收割以后卖给国家。如果地里的收入超过生产投资，新老社员共同分配；如果不足，也来共同负担。社扩大了，劳动力多了，才能把这些地种得更好。”
    子和对于吸收贫农入社表示同意了；但是，对于吸收中农入社思想还是不通，特别是对中农周元模入社不赞成。他说：“前年建社时，他仗着自己土地好，农具全，耕牛强，劳动力壮，入了社怕贫农沾了他的光，这种人现在也要入社，我不愿意。”
      “元模在申请书上已经检讨了这个缺点。他转变了，就该欢迎。要依靠贫农是对的，团结中农也是重要的。只有贫农中农团结，农业社才能办好。”
    子和对这一点也想开了。
    自从采取个别解决社员思想问题的工作方法后，收到了很大效果。原先不同意吸收新社员的老社员，现在都同意了。在又一次社员大会上，子和沉痛地对全体社员说：“我错了，我忘了解放前全家天天抱着空肚子，蹲在那间破屋里，吃刷锅水，冬天浑身冻得像个红萝卜似的。现在参加了社，生活好了，夜里睡觉盖着八斤重的棉被，我就满足了。看见社里有些公积金，就怕新社员占便宜，没有想到大家共同富裕的道理和社会主义的好日子。我真是看着脚尖在走路。”
    一九五四年年底，莲花农业生产合作社正式开了一个接受新社员入社大会。这一天，老社员就像办喜事似的那样高兴。中农周元模刚一进屋，子和就热情地喊着：“元模，来这里坐！”马上让位子给他。元模很受感动，亲切地对子和说：“我过去怕进社不能增产，怕吃亏，现在越想越感到自己落后。子和，你已先进社一年多啦！往后，好些事，你要指点我呢！”说完，子和也笑了一笑说：
  “往后我们都是农业生产合作社的社员了，要互相帮助，互相学习，努力把社办好啊！这是大事。”
    十九户贫、中农都加入了莲花农业生产合作社，新老社员们共同讨论了一九五五年生产计划，并在积极地进行各项准备工作，迎接春耕生产的到来。
