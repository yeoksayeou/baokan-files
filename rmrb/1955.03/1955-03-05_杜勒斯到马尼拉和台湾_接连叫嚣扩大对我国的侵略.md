Dulles Arrives in Manila and Taiwan
Repeatedly Clamoring to Expand Aggression Against Our Country

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Manila dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who arrived in Manila on the 1st, concluded his activities there on the 3rd and has gone to Taiwan to carry out conspiratorial activities.

Dulles attended the conference of U.S. diplomatic envoys to the Far East and Southwest Pacific region, which opened in Manila on the 2nd. The conference was attended by U.S. ambassadors and other senior diplomatic officials from various locations in the Far East and Southwest Pacific region.

News revealed that Dulles' speech at the meeting focused on the U.S. aggressive deployment in Asia, and the conspiracy to prepare for a new war against the Chinese people. He clamored that the United States should use Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina as "springboards" to expand the war threat and aggressive actions against China from "three fronts." He also clamored that the United States should persist in its policy of occupying China's territory of Taiwan and using it as a base for aggression.

Dulles also explained to the U.S. diplomatic officials "the importance of maximizing the local forces that the United States is prepared to support and strengthen in all aspects." This means that they should intensify their interference in the internal affairs of various countries, support reactionary forces, and suppress the forces striving for independence, freedom, and democracy in various countries.

Dulles also discussed the U.S. policy of strengthening economic aggression against Southeast Asia at the meeting. Dulles also stated that the United States is prepared to use Japan to strengthen its control over the Southeast Asian market and squeeze out the traditional economic forces of Britain and France. According to the United States Information Service, Dulles stated that in Southeast Asia, "there is a ready market for Japanese goods." He also said in a threatening tone, "It is almost inevitable that Japan will become a strong competitor to Western goods in this region." He also stated that in Indochina, France's preferential market "cannot continue indefinitely." From Dulles's words, it can be seen that one of the important reasons why the United States is trying its best to allow Japanese economic forces to enter the Southeast Asian region is to make Japan give up the idea of establishing and restoring trade exchanges with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

While in Manila, Dulles also held talks with Philippine President Magsaysay. The Associated Press said that they discussed "the Philippines' anti-communist mission in Asia," which is the role that the United States wants the Philippines to play in its intensified aggression against Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: After attending the Bangkok Conference and the conference of U.S. diplomatic envoys to the Far East, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles went to Taiwan on March 3rd and held a military conference with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to plan further obstruction of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Carney, Pacific Fleet Commander Stump, Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, and some other U.S. naval and air force generals stationed in the Far East also rushed to Taiwan to participate in this war planning.

After the meeting, Dulles issued a statement slandering and intimidating the Chinese people. He stated that this meeting was held to implement the U.S.-Chiang treaty. He also stated that the United States would "stand firm" on its position of obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands. Dulles threatened that "it cannot be assumed that (America's) defense will be static and limited to Taiwan itself." News said that before Dulles arrived in Taiwan, Chase, the head of the U.S. military assistance advisory group in Taiwan, had been active in the Chinese coastal islands occupied by the Chiang bandit troops, collecting intelligence for this meeting.

Before the meeting, Dulles attended the ceremony for the exchange of ratification documents of the U.S.-Chiang treaty. The U.S.-Chiang treaty has since "taken effect." However, the Chinese people have long declared that this war-like and aggressive treaty is illegal and invalid.

After the meeting, Dulles left Taiwan and returned to the United States. Carney and other U.S. military generals remained in Taiwan to continue holding military conferences with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. News said that Carney has an "urgent mission" to accelerate U.S. military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    杜勒斯到马尼拉和台湾
    接连叫嚣扩大对我国的侵略
      【新华社三日讯】　马尼拉消息：在一日到达马尼拉的美国国务卿杜勒斯已在三日结束了他在那里的活动，又到台湾去进行阴谋活动了。
    杜勒斯曾在马尼拉参加了在二日开幕的美国驻远东和西南太平洋地区外交使节会议。出席这次会议的有美国驻远东和西南太平洋地区各地的大使和其他高级外交官员。
    消息透露，杜勒斯在会上的发言着重谈到了美国在亚洲进行侵略部署，准备反对中国人民的新战争的阴谋。他叫嚣说，美国要利用台湾、朝鲜和印度支那作为“跳板”，从“三条战线”来扩大对中国的战争威胁和侵略行动。他还叫嚷美国要坚持侵占中国的领土台湾并且把它作为侵略基地的政策。
    杜勒斯还向美国外交官员们说明了“尽量发动美国准备从各方面予以支持和加强的地方力量的重要性”。这就是说，要他们加紧干涉各国内政，扶植反动势力，来镇压各国争取独立、自由、民主的力量。
    杜勒斯在会上还谈到了美国加强对东南亚经济侵略的政策。杜勒斯还表示美国准备利用日本来加强它对东南亚市场的控制，排挤英法传统经济势力。据美国新闻处透露，杜勒斯表示，在东南亚，“对日本货来说，是一个现成的市场”。他还以威胁的口吻说，“日本将成为这个地区的西方货物的有力竞争者，这差不多是不可避免的。”他并且表示，在印度支那，法国有优先权的市场“不能无限期地继续下去”。从杜勒斯的话里可以看得出，美国竭力要使日本经济势力打入东南亚地区的重要原因之一，就是要使日本放弃同中华人民共和国和苏联建立和恢复贸易交流的想法。
    杜勒斯在马尼拉还同菲律宾总统麦格赛赛举行了会谈，美联社说，他们讨论了“菲律宾在亚洲的反共任务”，也就是美国在加紧侵略亚洲的阴谋中要菲律宾担任的角色。
      【新华社四日讯】　美国国务卿杜勒斯在参加了曼谷会议和美国驻远东外交使节会议之后，在三月三日曾到台湾和蒋介石卖国集团举行军事会议，部署进一步阻挠中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的计划。美国海军作战部长卡涅、太平洋舰队司令斯图普、第七舰队司令普赖德和其他一些美国驻远东海空军将领，也同时赶到台湾参加这种战争策划。
      会后，杜勒斯发表了对中国人民肆行诬蔑和恫吓的声明。他表明，这次会议是为实施美蒋条约而举行的。并且声明美国要“坚守”阻挠中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的立场。杜勒斯恫吓说，“不能认为（美国的）防御将是静止的并且仅限于台湾本身”。有消息说，在杜勒斯到达台湾以前，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯曾到蒋贼军盘踞的中国沿海岛屿活动，为这次会议搜集情报。
    会前，杜勒斯参加了美蒋互换美蒋条约批准书的仪式。美蒋条约从此“生效”。然而中国人民早已声明过：这个战争性和侵略性的条约是非法的和无效的。
    会后，杜勒斯离开台湾返回美国。卡涅等美军将领留在台湾，继续和蒋介石卖国集团举行军事会议。有消息说，卡涅负有加速美国对蒋介石卖国集团的军事援助的“紧急任务”。
