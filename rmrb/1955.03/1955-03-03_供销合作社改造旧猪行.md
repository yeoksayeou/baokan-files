    Supply and Marketing Cooperative Transforms Old Pig Brokerage
    The Baisha District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, transformed an old pig brokerage into a live pig transaction service center, which is very satisfying to the surrounding masses. The Baisha Town originally had an old pig brokerage composed of eleven people. This pig brokerage had serious malpractices and some illegal activities in the past: buyers and sellers could not meet, and the pig brokerage often used methods such as suppressing and raising prices, raising and lowering scales, deducting weight, and using sick pigs as good pigs to exploit farmers; the pig brokerage also often colluded with rural mobile pig dealers to steal and evade state taxes; the pig brokerage retained the malpractice of "father dies, son inherits, dry shares for dividends," and a few non-laboring brokers could also sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. This not only aroused dissatisfaction among the surrounding masses and caused losses to the interests of the state, but also caused the brokers themselves to have low incomes and high expenses due to the large number of idlers in the pig brokerage, with an average monthly income of only 110,000 old currency per person.
    In order to promote hog production and carry out the socialist transformation of the old pig brokerage, the Baisha District Supply and Marketing Cooperative began to transform this pig brokerage into a live pig transaction service center in December last year. This live pig transaction service center abolished the past malpractices and formulated new management systems. At present, when farmers come to this exchange to buy and sell live pigs, they negotiate prices face-to-face based on the specific conditions of the live pigs' coat color, fatness, etc., with reference to the listed prices; the exchange assists both parties to achieve fair and reasonable transactions. In the past, the price of live pigs in Baisha Town sometimes rose to 2,900 old currency per catty, and sometimes fell to 700 old currency per catty. Now the price of live pigs has stabilized around the state listed price. The handling fee has also been reduced from 3 percent to 2.5 percent. The number of farmers buying and selling live pigs here has increased compared to the past. Within the exchange, accounting, meeting and other systems have been established. Brokers who used to sit and take dry shares have all been mobilized to change careers, and the remaining brokers have become staff members of the exchange. Their monthly income has increased by 50 percent compared to before. In addition, in the past, some farmers in the local area were affected by the old pig brokerage and also participated in transporting piglets and evading taxes to seek windfall profits. Now they have fully devoted themselves to agricultural production and no longer engage in speculative business. (Reported from Wuhan by our reporter)

    供销合作社改造旧猪行
    湖北省孝感县白沙区供销合作社改造旧猪行为生猪交易服务所，周围群众都很满意。白沙镇原有一所由十一个人组成的旧猪行，这个猪行过去有严重的陋规恶习及一些非法活动：买卖双方不能见面，猪行经常用压价抬价、抬秤压秤、克扣斤两、以病猪充好猪等办法剥削农民；猪行还常同农村流动猪贩勾结起来，偷漏国家税收；猪行中保存着“父死子继，乾股分红”的陋规，少数不劳动的经纪人也可坐享其成。这样它不但引起了周围群众的不满，使国家利益受到损失，经纪人本身也因猪行中闲人多，收入少，开支大，每月每人平均只能收入旧币十一万元。
    白沙区供销合作社为了促进毛猪生产和对旧猪行进行社会主义改造，在去年十二月份，就着手将这个猪行改造成为生猪交易服务所。这个生猪交易服务所废除了过去的陋规，制定了新的经营管理制度。目前，农民到这个交易所买卖生猪，都根据生猪的毛色、肥胖等具体情况，参照牌价，由双方当面议定价格；交易所协助双方使交易达到公平合理。过去，白沙镇的生猪价格有时涨到旧币二千九百元一斤，有时跌落到旧币七百元一斤，现在生猪价格已经稳定在国家牌价上下。手续费也由过去的百分之三降低到百分之二点五。到这里买卖生猪的农民比过去增加。交易所内部，建立了会计、会议等制度。过去坐拿乾股的经纪人，都已被动员转业，留下的经纪人成了交易所的工作人员。他们每月的收入比以前增加百分之五十。另外，当地过去有一部分农民受旧猪行的影响，也参加贩运小猪、偷漏税收来谋取暴利，现在他们已经全力投入农业生产，不再做投机生意。　（本报记者武汉讯）
