Gansu Province is preparing to expand the planting area of sweet clover and alfalfa by 400,000 mu to solve the problem of livestock feed shortage in rural areas.

Currently, the province has allocated 85,000 jin of sweet clover seeds to the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, Dingxi, and Linxia Special Districts, and 5,000 jin of sweet clover seeds to Yongdeng, Jingtai, Gaolan, Lanzhou City, and Yinchuan City. These seeds have been transported to various locations and can expand the planting area by 25,000 mu to 30,000 mu. In addition, the sweet clover seeds retained by Tianshui Special District can expand the planting area by about 30,000 mu.

The alfalfa planting area is planned to be expanded by 360,000 mu this year.

To make it convenient for farmers in various regions to plant and not bear transportation costs, all sweet clover seeds and alfalfa seeds in arid areas allocated this year will be invested by the government and lent to farmers for planting by means of lending physical objects and collecting physical objects. In general areas, the local supply and marketing cooperatives will supply them to the masses. At present, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has also sent people to the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region and Dingxi and other places to guide forage grass planting.

    甘肃将扩种牧草四十万亩
    甘肃省准备扩大草木樨和苜蓿种植面积四十万亩，解决农村中缺乏牲畜饲草的困难。
    目前已由省里拨给西海固回族自治区、定西和临夏专区草木樨种籽八万五千斤，分配给永登、景泰、皋兰、兰州市、银川市草木樨种籽五千斤，这些种籽已分别运到各地，共可扩大播种面积两万五千亩到三万亩。另外，天水专区自留的草木樨种籽，还可扩大播种面积三万亩左右。
    苜蓿种植面积，今年准备扩大三十六万亩。
    为使各地农民种植方便，并不负担运输等费用，今年拨出的全部草木樨种籽和干旱地区的苜蓿种籽，都由政府投资，采取贷实物收实物的办法借给农民播种，一般地区则拨由当地供销合作社给群众供应。现在，农林厅并已派人到西海固回族自治区和定西等地指导牧草播种工作。
