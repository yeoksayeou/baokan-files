The Chinese Communist Party Yili District Committee Established

    With the approval of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party Yili District Committee has been formally established. In addition to leading the work of the CCP Yili, Tacheng, and Altay Local Committees within the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Province, it is also entrusted by the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee to lead the work of the CCP Bortala Local Committee.

    The establishment of the Yili District Committee will further strengthen the unity between the Kazakhs and other ethnic groups within the Autonomous Prefecture and within the Kazakhs themselves, which is of extremely important significance for the further development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of all ethnic groups.
