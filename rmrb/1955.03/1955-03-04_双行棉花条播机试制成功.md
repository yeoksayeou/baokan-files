    Successful Trial Production of Double-Row Cotton Strip Seeder
    The Northwest Agricultural Implement Factory has basically succeeded in the trial production of a "double-row cotton strip seeder."
    In the past, farmers used old agricultural implements to plant cotton. The furrows were of varying depths, the seeds were sown unevenly, and the sowing efficiency was low, wasting seeds and animal power, thereby increasing production costs and affecting cotton yield. The staff of the Northwest Agricultural Implement Factory began researching new cotton planters in 1950. After several improvements and experiments, forty "double-row cotton strip seeders" were trial-produced in the spring of 1954. The results of these new product trials proved that the double-row cotton strip seeder sows seeds evenly, saving seeds; has high work efficiency, generally requiring only one relatively strong animal (ox, horse, mule) to pull it, and can sow forty mu per day working ten hours; can sow two rows at a time, with row spacing adjustable between one foot five inches and two feet; sowing depth is one inch to two and a half inches; the maximum sowing rate is fourteen jin per mu, and the minimum is seven jin per mu, with soil covering and compaction completed in one operation; the average seed breakage rate is only 0.9 percent; it can be used generally except in areas with particularly heavy and sticky soil.
    Currently, the staff of the Northwest Agricultural Implement Factory has trial-produced more than two hundred double-row cotton strip seeders and has added marker devices and compaction wheels based on mass feedback. They are preparing to conduct further trials and improvements. (Li Yunhu)

    双行棉花条播机试制成功
    西北农具厂试制“双行棉花条播机”已基本成功。
    过去农民用旧农具植棉，耩的沟有深有浅，下籽不均匀，播种效率不高，浪费种子和畜力，因而使生产成本增大，并影响着棉花的产量。西北农具厂职工从一九五零年开始研究新式棉花播种机，经过数次改进和试验，在一九五四年春季试制出“双行棉花条播机”四十部。这些新产品试验结果证明：双行棉花条播机下籽均匀，节省种籽；工作效能高，一般用一头比较强壮的牲口（牛、马、骡）即可拉动，每天工作十小时，可播种四十亩；一次可播两行，行距由一尺五寸到二尺之间，可随意调节，播种深度一寸至二寸半；播种量最大每亩可播种十四斤，最小可播七斤，覆土镇压一次完成，破籽率平均仅百分之零点九；除土质特殊粘重的地区外，一般都能使用。
    目前西北农具厂职工又试制出二百多部双行棉花条播机，并接受群众意见，增添了示迹器和镇压轮。他们准备再作试验和改进。　（李运笏）
