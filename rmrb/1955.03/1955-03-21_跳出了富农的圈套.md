"Old Li! I almost forgot to tell you, even Li Degen has transformed! He came to me three times in a row, determined to join the cooperative!" Li Huazhi, the director of the "Five Star" agricultural production cooperative in Liangshui Village, Wenjiang County, Sichuan, was chatting with me about the recent situation in the cooperative when she suddenly interjected with this.

I remembered the scene when we lived in Liangshui Village last June. At that time, people said: "Li Degen's ideological disease is deeply rooted! It's been more than four years since liberation, and he's still tangled with the landlords and rich peasants like 'a Taoist priest's hair'!"

Now that Director Li said he "transformed," I thought: Peasants are laborers after all, and under the education of the Party, they will transform sooner or later. But I also thought: How could someone like him transform so quickly? I eagerly asked Li Huazhi to invite Li Degen to talk. The next day at noon, he came.

As Li Degen talked to me, he became more and more excited, his words pouring out like water released from a sluice gate.

　　Forgot the Pain Once the Wound Healed

　　"Before liberation, one year, I rented 25 mu of land from the landlord Peng Jingru. My family worked hard, trying to carve out a path to 'get rich' from the land. But at that time, which peasant could afford to 'hang up a sign of idleness'! The second year, we were flooded. The landlord didn't care about the poor harvest and took all the rent. We had no grain at home, and the puppet township government, under the guise of 'following the soil to find grain,' wanted us to pay several years of back rent for the landlord, and arrested my father twice, imprisoning him for twelve days. The third year, the landlord used the trick of 're-renting and then cultivating,' forcing my brother to put his fingerprint on the lease termination agreement, with both threats and deception. The deposit of fifteen shih of rice was swindled away, and my family was driven out, empty-handed, to Liangshui Village. In those years, we couldn't even afford to raise a pig comfortably!

　　"Liberation came! The local tyrant landlord Peng Jingru was brought to justice, and we benefited from rent reduction. Although I was grateful to the Communist Party at that time, I didn't understand the Party's policies. I regarded the landlord class as individual people. I thought the local tyrant landlord Peng Jingru was vicious and should be suppressed; but the landlord Luo Ruiting was my distant cousin-in-law, and although he had increased rents and demanded deposits before liberation, he was still a relative. When the deposit refund movement started, Luo Ruiting secretly transferred several boxes of clothing and valuables to my house. Our hearts softened, and we accepted them. The village cadres and masses educated me many times, but I always refused to hand them over. My wife, Sun Yufang, repeatedly advised me not to be so muddleheaded, but I wouldn't listen and even divorced her. In the end, the assets secretly transferred by the landlord were uncovered by the masses. As a result, I gradually became estranged from the villagers."

　　Fell for the Rich Peasant's Scheme

　　These lessons did not make Li Degen realize the wickedness of the exploiting classes, the shamefulness of the exploiting life, he still thought about "getting rich alone." He said, "I felt that after liberation, I was no longer bullied and oppressed and could develop freely. Guo Fuhua, a rich peasant in our village, instigated me, saying that tree seedlings were very valuable, sometimes a single nanmu or cypress seedling could be worth more than a sheng of rice. After discussing it with my family, we immediately started the tree seedling business. After the land reform, my family of nine was allocated seventeen mu of land and houses, and our life got better and better. Then, the village launched the mutual aid and cooperation movement. I thought the mutual aid group would restrict my free development and refused to join. At this time, Huang Zihua, a rich peasant in neighboring Jiucun, also saw an opportunity and pulled me in! Huang Zihua enticed me, saying: 'The fat pig business is much more profitable than the tree seedling business! I used to buy large-framed pigs cheaply in Guanxian, Chongqing, and other places, and fatten them up with soaked dried sweet potatoes mixed with hemp dregs and rice bran. After ten or twenty days, I would transport the pigs to Chengdu and weigh them together with their excrement and urine. The excrement, urine, and feed alone would add at least fifty catties. One fat pig can earn at least two hundred thousand yuan (old currency)!’ When I heard this, it suited my heart, and I immediately stopped the tree seedling business and ran with him. After that, I followed Huang Zihua to Guanxian Shiyangchang, Liujiezi, Chongqing Yangma Township, and other places. The cunning Huang Zihua took advantage of the fact that local farmers were ‘out of touch with the market if they didn't go to the fair for three days’ and tricked farmers into selling their pigs to him at low prices, then transported them to Wenjiang and Chengdu to sell at high prices. Then, Guo Fuhua, a rich peasant in our village, also joined in and colluded with Huang Zihua. Deceived by these two rich peasants, seven farmers in the village, including Zhang Hongyuan, Kang Yuming, and Li Xuezhong, also started running the pig business.

　　"In the spring of 1953, during the planting season, I returned home from Liujiezi, Guanxian, and came across the village promoting the advanced experience of 'less seedlings and dense planting.' My heart stirred, and I wanted to plant like the masses. But the rich peasant Guo Fuhua said to me behind my back: 'Sparse planting yields one shih, dense planting is barely enough for seed.' Dense planting is useless! As a result, I planted the seedlings with 'four large open spaces' of more than a foot wide. When the autumn harvest came, I harvested more than a dou less grain per mu than others. At the end of the year, the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sales. The villagers were overjoyed to sell surplus grain. My family, including the rented public land, had about nineteen mu, but only sold 1,100 catties of surplus grain. I thought that planting grain was troublesome, so it was better to grow more cash crops to make money; I stored rapeseed at home and deliberately didn't sell it to the state. I quietly boiled three dou and two sheng of it and sowed it in four mu of hemp land. As a result, all five sheng of hemp seeds were burned to death, losing more than five dou of rice. When I replanted the seeds the second time, they all became 'bent-necked hemp' because of improper fertilization! Four mu of land yielded eight hundred catties less branches, losing more than five hundred thousand yuan.

　　"Seeing the losses in production again and again, my heart ached a little. At this time, the rich peasant Guo Fuhua came to me again and said: 'If the east is not bright, go west. Besides the stars, there is also the moon! As long as you run a few more businesses, you can earn back any money. What's the big deal about a little loss in production!' The rich peasant's 'ghost fire' grabbed my heart like iron claws. I hardened my heart and followed the rich peasant again. At first, I occasionally did a fat pig business, but later I slowly followed the rich peasants to grab and resell sweet potatoes, potatoes, and vegetables. During these days, I followed the rich peasants to Shuangliu and Chengdu many times, and even took the train to Shibantan, Huayang."

　　Started to Transform

　　It was at the time of unified purchase and sales of grain that the class enemies' conspiracy to create rumors, incite, and sabotage was exposed. The masses angrily exposed the crimes of the rich peasant Guo Fuhua in sabotaging unified purchase and sales and sabotaging mutual aid and cooperation. The government lawfully detained him and sentenced him to imprisonment. This incident gave Li Degen a great shock. He said, "On the night I returned from the public trial in Wenjiang, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. I thought about a lot of things that night! I thought: When I followed the rich peasant, had he ever treated me sincerely? Once, I personally bought a smooth and fat pig, but Guo Fuhua snatched it away, making two hundred thousand yuan with a single turn. Another time, Guo Fuhua took the lead in delivering wood, swallowing all the wages of three hundred thousand yuan owed to ten farmers in the village, including me! I also thought about how, in 1953, at the beginning of the unified purchase, Guo Fuhua provoked me, saying: 'The Communist Party's unified purchase and sales will eventually leave everyone with nothing to eat!' This made me resist unified purchase and sales and not sell rapeseed to the state. From my own deception and suffering, I further thought about the destructive things the rich peasant had done in the village. I personally saw him sneak into the mutual aid groups of Su Guanghan, Yang Dafa, and Du Guomin three times, and he dragged down these three mutual aid groups three times. Every single thing pierced my heart! The more I thought about it, the angrier I became, and I didn't close my eyes all night. Early the next morning, we held a family meeting and decided to break with the exploiting classes once and for all!

　　"Then, the village was going to build a cooperative. My heart was warm, and I wanted to join the cooperative, but I was afraid of suffering losses. Sometimes I thought that my big bull would drag down the cart after joining the cooperative, and sometimes I worried that it wouldn't be worth it to join the cooperative because there would be too much feed. After discussing it with my family, we braved the heavy rain and sold all three hundred catties of sweet potato bran at a cheap price of six hundred yuan per catty. When it came time to build the cooperative, the masses said: Although his family has severed ties with the rich peasants and has transformed, his selfishness is still heavy, and he cannot be absorbed into the cooperative for the time being. Because I did not join the cooperative when it was time to feed the pigs, I had to buy back the sweet potato bran at the market price of one thousand one hundred yuan per catty."

　　"Business is a flower before your eyes, farming the land yields crops."

　　"Autumn harvest came. Because I listened to the rich peasant's nonsense in the first half of the year and didn't buy fertilizer for the fields, I harvested nearly a dou less grain per mu than others. Especially the fields on both sides of the road, I harvested one and a half dou less! At that time, I felt like a 'cat scratching' my heart again! Looking back, I saw the 'Five Star' agricultural production cooperative newly built by Li Huazhi and the others, with 87 households. The cooperative members were all increasing production, handing over public grain, selling surplus grain, and joining the credit cooperative, all enthusiastically marching forward. What surprised me the most was that Zhou Songshi, who lived in the same courtyard, had a family of three with no labor force. In the past, she was always struggling to make ends meet, couldn't even pay the public grain, and her clothes were patched upon patches. In 1954, she paid off the public grain, sold surplus grain, and even put on a brand-new 'worker-peasant' blue shirt. One evening, I couldn't help but sneakily ran to ask her: What clever method does the cooperative have? Why can everyone increase production after joining the cooperative? She smiled and replied: How can we not increase production? You calculate it carefully! The cooperative has more people and greater strength, removing field ridges, merging ditches, and opening up wasteland, how much should that increase production? Small fields become large fields, plowing, harrowing, and sowing can all use new agricultural tools, plowing deeper, harrowing finer, and sowing more evenly, how much more should that increase production? The cooperative can plant crops according to soil properties, fertilize according to the crops, and can divide labor according to labor and technical specialties. The old, weak, disabled, and sick can all have suitable jobs, and everyone can do their best. How much more should that increase production?… A word made me convinced from the bottom of my heart. After thinking about it again and again, I finally came to these old sayings: 'Business is a flower before your eyes, farming the land yields crops!' 'Pick up a plank outside, lose a door at home!' Hard work and production are the foundation for farmers, and loving the country is loving oneself!"

　　Determined to Join the Cooperative

　　"After that, my family's enthusiasm for production became greater and greater! Not long ago, when my brother Li Dezhong and I were working on the hemp field, we accidentally looked up and saw two cooperative members from the 'Five Star' Cooperative walking over with two fat bulls. We brothers were so fond and envious that we were stunned. I thought: Where did the cooperative get these two 'strong bulls'? When we asked, we learned that the cooperative had sold an old bull a few days ago and immediately collectively bought back two strong bulls for three million five hundred thousand yuan. I said: 'If our bull gets old in the future, we will be weak and have no strength to replace it with a strong bull immediately.' My brother said: 'Yes! If we hadn't been fooled by the rich peasant, we would have joined the cooperative long ago! Now we should turn back as soon as possible and take the bright road of socialism!' While we were chatting enthusiastically, suddenly there was a sound of '哗哗哗'. When we turned around, we saw that the ditch water was flowing through the eel hole that had been pierced, into the hemp field that the cooperative had just sown on the other side of the ditch! My brother and I immediately jumped over the ditch, digging mud and filling the hole, and we plugged it in no time. At that time, we were thinking: What will happen if the hemp field is flooded! We are going to be members of the cooperative sooner or later! Can we not cherish the crops of the cooperative!'"

This January, Li Degen warmly invited Li Huazhi to his house three times to sit, smoke, and talk. Every time, the first thing he would ask was:

"Director, when exactly are you going to expand the cooperative?" Every time he finally saw the director off, he would repeatedly tell her: "This time when you expand the cooperative, you must not forget me!"

    跳出了富农的圈套
    李同福
    “老李！差点儿忘记了告诉你，连李德根都转变啦！接连找我三次，坚决要入社呢！”四川温江县凉水村“五星”农业生产合作社社长李华芝，正和我摆谈着社里最近的情况，突然插了这么一句。
    我想起了去年六月间，我们住在凉水村的情景。那时候，人们都说：“李德根的思想病害得深！解放都四年多了，他还和地主富农像‘道士的头发’一样——挽在一起！”
    眼前李社长说他“转变了”，我心想：农民究竟是劳动者，在党的教育下，迟早都要转变的。可是我又想：像他这样的人，怎么会转变得这么快呢？我殷切地托李华芝约李德根来谈谈。第二天晌午，他来了。
    李德根同我谈着，越谈越激动，话像埝口上刚抽开闸板的水一样，一股赶一股地涌了出来。
      好了疮疤忘了痛
      “解放前，有一年，我佃了地主彭敬如二十五亩田，一家人勤扒苦做，一心想从土地上理出个
  ‘发财’的路子来。可是，那时候，哪个农民的门上挂得住‘无事牌’！第二年就遭水淹。地主不管庄稼歉收，把租子全部收走，家里颗粒精光，伪乡公所还借名‘跟土寻粮’，要我们替地主交几年的欠粮，把我父亲抓去两次，关了十二天。第三年，又被地主用‘转佃再耕’的鬼花样，连吓带哄地强迫我哥哥在退佃纸约上按了手印。十五石米的押金被诈光，一家人被撵了出来，赤手空拳来到了凉水村。在那些年月里，连猪都没有伸伸展展喂过一只！
      “解放了！恶霸地主彭敬如伏了法，我们又得了减租的好处，日子好起来了。我那时虽然感激共产党，可是我对党的政策并不了解。我把地主阶级当成单个单个的人来看。我认为恶霸地主彭敬如凶恶，该镇压；可是地主罗瑞廷是我远房的二姑爷，虽然解放前也曾升租加押剥削过我，可是到底是亲戚。退押运动展开了，罗瑞廷疏散了几口箱子的衣饰财物到我家里来。我们心头一软，就收下了。村里干部群众多次教育我，我总不承认交出。我妻子孙玉芳一再劝我不要这样糊涂，我也不听，还和她闹得离了婚。地主疏散的财物，最后还是被群众清查了出来。这一来，我慢慢和村里群众疏远了。”
      上了富农的当
    这些教训，并没能使李德根认清剥削阶级的恶毒，剥削生活的可耻，他还老想着要“独发财”。他说：“我觉得解放后，再不受人欺凌压迫，可以自由自在地发展了。本村富农郭富华挑弄我，说树秧子很值价，有时一株楠木或柏树秧，就要值一升多米。我和家里人一商量，马上就动手做起树秧子生意来。土地改革以后，我们一家九口人分了十七亩田地，又分了房子，光景越来越好。随后，村里开展了互助合作运动。我认为互助组会限制我的自由发展，不肯加入。就在这个时候，邻近九村的富农黄子华也瞅着空子拉我来了！黄子华勾引我说：‘树秧子生意哪有肥猪生意利大！我往回在灌县、崇庆等地相因（便宜）买回大架子猪，用干苕子发水和着麻枯、米糠一催胀，一二十天后就把猪运到成都，连屎带尿一齐称，单是屎尿和草料就要多称他五十斤。一只肥猪至少要赚二十来万元（旧币，下同）！’我一听正合心意，心头一热，马上就收了树秧子生意，跟他跑起来。这以后，我就跟上黄子华经常在灌县石羊场、柳街子，崇庆羊马乡等地方来来去去。刁猾的黄子华，欺负当地农民‘三天不赶场，买卖不归行’（不清楚市价），跑到农民家里，低价骗购农民猪只，运到温江、成都高价出卖。接着，本村富农郭富华也加进来，和黄子华勾结一气了。受了这两个富农的诱骗，村里张洪元、康玉明、李学中等七户农民也跟上跑起猪生意来。
    “一九五三年春天栽种时节，我由灌县柳街子回到了家里，碰上村里正在推广‘少秧密栽’的先进经验。我心头一动，想跟着群众一样栽法。可是富农郭富华背后对我说：‘稀稀散，振一石；密密耸，将够种。’栽密了对个屁！结果，我又把秧子栽成了一尺多宽的‘四大亮’。秋收下来，每亩比别人少收谷子一斗多。年底，国家实行统购统销政策，村里农民都欢天喜地卖余粮，我家里连佃耕的公田共约十九亩，却只卖了余粮一千一百斤。我认为粮食种好了麻烦多，不如多种经济作物好赚钱；家里存下菜籽，故意不卖给国家，悄悄地煮了三斗二升，撒到四亩麻地里。结果，五升麻籽全部烧死，损失了五斗多米。第二回补点下去，又因为施肥不得当，尽成了‘弯脑壳麻’！四亩田少收枝子八百斤，损失五十多万元。
      “眼看着生产上一次又一次的损失，我心头有些痛起来了。这时，富农郭富华又来向我说：‘东方不亮走西方，除了星星还有月亮！只要多跑几转生意，啥子钱也赚回来了，生产上点把点损失有啥了不起！’富农的‘鬼吹火’，像铁爪子一般牢牢地抓住了我的心。我心头一横，就又跟上富农跑起来。先还是间或做一转肥猪生意，后来又慢慢跟着富农抢购倒贩起红苕、马铃薯和菜蔬来。这些日子，我跟在富农屁股后多次跑过双流和成都，还坐火车去过华阳石扳滩。”
      开始转变了
    就在粮食统购统销的时候阶级敌人造谣煽动破坏的阴谋被揭发出来了。群众愤怒地检举了富农郭富华破坏统购统销、破坏互助合作的罪行，政府依法把他扣押起来，判处了徒刑。这件事给了李德根很大的震动。他说：“在温江参加了公审大会回来的那天晚上，我翻天覆去，怎么也睡不着。这一夜我想的事情可多了！我想起：以往跟上富农跑，富农何尝拏真心对待过我？有一次我亲手买好一只油光水滑的大肥猪，却被郭富华横撇撇硬卡了过去，一转手就赚了二十万元。又一次，郭富华承头送木料，把村里连我在内十户农民应得的工资三十万元全部吞了！又想到一九五三年统购一开始，郭富华挑弄我说：‘共产党统购统销，到头来要弄得大家没吃的！’害得我抵触统购统销，有菜籽不卖给国家。我由自己的上当、吃亏，又进一步想到富农在这个村子里的破坏事情。我亲眼看到他先后三次混进苏光汉、杨大发、杜国民三个互助组，就三次拖垮了这三个互助组。一桩一桩事刺得我的心疼！我越想越气愤，一夜没有合眼。第二天一早，我们开了一个家庭会，决心从此和剥削阶级一刀两断！
      “接着，村上要建社了。我心头热呼呼地，又想入社，又怕吃亏。一阵想到自己那条大牯牛入社后会拖垮架，一阵又耽心饲料多了入社划不着。我们，一家人一商量，就冒着大雨，连挑带背，拿六百元一斤的相因（便宜）价钱；把家里的三百斤苕糠全部卖光。到建社时，群众说：他家里虽然和富农割断了联系，有了转变，但私心还重，暂时不能吸收入社。社没有入成，到需要喂猪的时候，我不得不又花一千一百元一斤的市价把苕糠买回来。”
   “生意买卖眼前花，锄头落地出庄稼”
      “秋收了。我因为上半年听了富农的冤枉话，有钱不买肥料下到田里，每亩田比别人少收将近一斗谷子。特别是大路两边那几块田，少收一斗五有多！那时我心头又一次感到了像‘猫抓’一样的难受！我回过头来，看到李华芝他们新建起来八十七户人的‘五星’农业生产合作社，社员们个个增产，交公粮，卖余粮，入信用社，都热火朝天地走在前头。最使我奇怪的是：同院子住的周宋氏，一家三口，全无劳力，往年扯前盖后，连公粮都交不清，一身衣服补钉补疤，一九五四年她交清了公粮，还卖了余粮，新崭崭的‘工农’蓝衫子也穿上了身。一个晚上，我硬是不服气地悄悄跑去问她：合作社到底有啥子巧办法，为啥子个个人入了社都能增产呢？她笑眯眯地回答我：咋个不增产喃？你细算一算！合作社人多力量大，捣了田坎，并了水沟，开了荒地，该增产多少？小田变成了大田，耖田挂田、抛粮下种，都能用新式农具，耖得深、挂得细、播得匀，又该增产多少？社里可以按土性种庄稼、下肥料，可以按劳力技术特长分工，老、弱、残、废都能有合适的活路做，大家都尽力干，这又该增产多少？……一席话把我说得从心窝子里信服了起来。我前想后想，终于归落到这几句老话上：
  ‘生意买卖眼前花，锄头落地出庄稼！’‘外边捡块板，家头掉扇门！’庄稼人努力劳动生产才是根本，爱国家也就是爱自己！”
      下定决心入社
    “这以后，我们一家人搞生产的劲头越来越大了！前不多天，我和哥哥李德忠正在整麻地的时候，偶然一抬头，远远望见‘五星’社两个社员牵着两条肥肥的大牯牛走了过来，我们两弟兄又喜爱又羡慕，高兴得看都看呆了。我心想：社里头哪来的这两条‘壮口子牛’呀？走拢一问，才知道前几天社里卖了一条老牛，马上就集体拿三百五十万元买回两条壮牛来。我说：‘像我们那条牛，将来老了，一家一户，人单力薄，哪有力量马上就换回壮牛来？’哥哥说：‘是呀！不是上富农的当，我们也早入社啦！现在应该趁早回头来走社会主义的光明大路了！’正摆得热闹，突然‘哗哗哗’一阵水响，一掉头，原来沟水正通过浸穿了的黄鳝洞，向沟那边社头才播了种的那块麻田里流着！我们两弟兄连忙跳过沟去，挖的挖泥，填的填洞，两下就给塞住了。那时，我们心头想的是：麻田淹了水咋得了喃！我们迟早是社里的人啦！对社头的庄稼还能不痛惜吗！……”
    今年一月，李德根先后三次热情地把李华芝拉到他家里坐着吃烟谈话，每次劈头一句总是先问：
  “社长，你们究竟好久扩社呀？”每次当他最后送社长出门的时候，也总是再三叮咛：“这回扩社，可千万不能忘掉我啊！”
