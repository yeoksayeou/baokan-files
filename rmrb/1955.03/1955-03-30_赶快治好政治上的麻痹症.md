    Quickly Cure Political Paralysis
    Ying Lin
    Recently, Tianjin captured a counter-revolutionary element who had been hiding in the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau. During the interrogation, it was discovered that this counter-revolutionary had, during his time hiding in the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau, repeatedly stolen secrets of our Party and the state and had already disseminated the secrets he obtained.
    The occurrence of this serious leak of secrets was due to the serious political paralysis suffered by Li Qinghai, the former director of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau, and Huang Jinghua, the current director. Not only did they fail to discover in time that a counter-revolutionary element had infiltrated the vital departments of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau, but they also failed to strictly safeguard confidential materials and documents of the Party and the state in accordance with the regulations of the Party and the state. The drawers in which they stored confidential documents could be left unlocked, or even if they were locked, the keys were placed in another unlocked drawer. The notebooks in which they recorded confidential materials could be placed together with public books and magazines. They did not tidy up unfinished documents when they left work, but left them casually on the table. Since these two responsible cadres were so negligent and so careless, it naturally gave the hidden enemy a rare opportunity. Therefore, within a period of more than two months, this counter-revolutionary element was able to take advantage of his night shift to read through various work reports and summaries of Li Qinghai and Huang Jinghua, read through their notebooks, and finally open the drawers of their desks to peek at confidential Party documents. This counter-revolutionary element so easily stole many major secrets within the Party and the state-owned enterprise.
    In our Party, state organs, enterprise departments, schools, and mass organizations, there are many people like Li Qinghai and Huang Jinghua. In addition to the serious leaks and disclosures caused by failing to pay attention to the preservation of confidential Party and non-Party documents as mentioned above, they are also very poor at restraining their tongues. In order to boast that they know more than others, they can casually talk about confidential events within the Party and state organs to their relatives and friends; even in public places, such as streetcars, buses, and cinemas and theaters, they talk about these matters; or they read internal publications containing important confidential materials on streetcars and other public places. If someone interferes with these comrades, some of them even think that this has hurt their "face" and interfered with their "freedom."
    This kind of negligent, careless, and boastful ideological style is extremely harmful to a Communist Party member and revolutionary worker. If this political paralysis is not cured quickly, serious incidents of leaks and disclosures like those at the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau will inevitably occur, causing irreparable losses to the cause of the Party and the people.

    赶快治好政治上的麻痹症
    应麟
    最近，天津市捕获了一个潜藏在天津电业局的反革命分子。在侦讯过程中查明：这个反革命犯潜伏在天津电业局的期间，曾经多次地窃取过我们党和国家的机密，并且已经把他获得的机密向外作了传播。
    这个严重失密的事件的发生，是因为天津电业局前任局长李清海和现任局长黄靖华都患了严重的政治麻痹症。他们不但没有及时发现反革命分子已经钻进了天津电业局的要害部门，而且没有按照党和国家的规定，严密保管党和国家的机密材料和文件。他们存放机密文件的抽屉可以不锁，或者虽然锁了，却把钥匙放在另一个没有锁的抽屉里，他们记有机密材料的笔记本可以同公开的书籍杂志放在一起。他们下班时不把没有办完的文件收拾好，随便摆在桌子上。既然这两个负责干部是这样的麻痹大意，这样的漫不经心，自然给了暗藏的敌人以难得的机会。因此，在两个多月的时间以内，这个反革命分子就能够利用他值夜班的机会，翻阅李清海、黄靖华两人的各种工作报告、总结，翻阅他们两人的笔记本，最后打开他们办公桌的抽屉偷看了党内的机密文件。这个反革命分子就这样容易地窃取了党和国家企业内部的许多重大机密。
    在我们党内、国家机关、企业部门和学校及群众团体中，像李清海和黄靖华这样的人是不少的。他们除了上面所说的由于不注意保存党内外机密文件因而造成严重的失密泄密现象外，还很不会约束自己的舌头。他们为了夸耀自己知道的东西比别人多，可以对自己的亲戚、朋友随便谈论党内和国家机关的机密事件；甚至在公共场所，例如电车、公共汽车上和影院、戏院内，也这样谈论着；或者在电车上及其他公共场所阅读载有重大机密材料的内部刊物。如果有人对这些同志加以干涉时，他们中有人还认为这是伤害了自己的“面子”，妨害了他们的“自由”。
    这种麻痹大意、漫不经心和夸夸其谈的思想作风，对于一个共产党员和革命工作人员来说是极其有害的。如果不赶快治好这种政治麻痹症，那就必然会发生像天津电业局一样的严重失密和泄密事件，使党和人民的事业遭受难以挽回的损失。
