    Aggressors Must Not Be Tolerated

    Recently, while the United States has been trying to equip the Manila Treaty with "teeth" by various means, it has also been busy "implementing" the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and has been carrying out intense activities in the Taiwan area.
    Following the Bangkok Conference, from March 3rd to 5th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and a large group of senior U.S. Navy and Air Force generals gathered in Taiwan and held "the largest war conference" (according to the Associated Press) with the Chiang gang, discussing a series of military steps after the US-Chiang treaty "came into effect." According to various sources, these steps are: First, the United States is stepping up the deployment of its armed forces in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands. Second, the United States is further expanding its naval and air force bases in Taiwan to strengthen its occupation of Taiwan. Third, the United States is accelerating and increasing the shipment of warships, landing craft, aircraft, and military supplies to strengthen the military power of the Chiang gang. Fourth, the United States is expanding its huge "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Taiwan and establishing a US-Chiang "Joint Military Command" to allow the United States to more directly direct and participate in the military activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group. According to the Associated Press, one item on the agenda of the US-Chiang military conference was: discussing "possible targets on the mainland." At the same time, the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the Chiang gang's navy held large-scale "joint exercises" in Taiwan. They openly regarded the Chinese people as the hypothetical enemy in their exercises.
    All of this prominently shows that the United States is stepping up armed aggression and war preparations in the Taiwan area.
    Not only that, but the U.S. responsible authorities have repeatedly issued blatant war threats against the Chinese people. Dulles specifically issued a statement on the day the US-Chiang treaty "came into effect," saying that as long as the United States believes that certain actions by the Chinese people "constitute the first stage of an attack on Taiwan," then the U.S. military action will "not be limited to Taiwan itself." On March 8th, he also clamored in Washington that the U.S.'s actions to "defend" Taiwan "have flexibility and are not necessarily limited to static defense." This means that the United States intends to go to war with the Chinese people and is preparing to attack the Chinese mainland.
    The U.S. aggressive clique and its followers once lied that the US-Chiang treaty was "purely defensive in nature," a "step towards establishing a more peaceful situation," and to "seek to reduce the danger in the Far East situation." But these cheap lies have been completely exposed by today's facts. Everyone sees that the United States is using the "implementation" of the US-Chiang treaty to strengthen its armed occupation of Taiwan, accelerate the steps of war preparation, and aggravate the tense situation in the Far East.
    Moreover, the United States is also combining its activities in the Taiwan area with its conspiracies to undermine peace in Korea and Indochina. Dulles has repeatedly stated that the United States regards the situations in Indochina, Korea, and Taiwan as "a whole" and intends to attack the Chinese people from these "three fronts." This is by no means accidental. It shows that today's U.S. aggressive clique is not only unwilling to accept its failure in China, but also unwilling to accept the victories won by Asian peace forces in Korea and Indochina. Precisely because of this, the United States is stepping up armed aggression against Taiwan, creating and aggravating tensions there, in order to find opportunities and excuses to undermine peace in the Far East and prepare to launch a new war of aggression in Asia. This war of aggression is mainly directed against the Chinese people, but also against the people of other countries in Asia. It is obvious that this arrogant ambition and active preparation of the United States has greatly deepened the war crisis in Asia.
    In the face of such obvious facts, some people are still trying to make futile cover-ups for the United States. On the same day that Dulles threatened that the United States did not intend to merely "statically defend" Taiwan, Eden said in the British House of Commons: "The United States government has provided affirmative evidence that they hope to ease tensions and reduce the danger of war." What exactly is this evidence? Naturally, there is no such evidence. What people are seeing now is precisely the opposite "evidence," that is, insisting on forcibly occupying other countries' territories, interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and frantically engaging in war threats and preparations for aggressive war. All of this is of course incompatible with the "hope" of "easing tensions and reducing the danger of war."
    Any honest person will conclude that only by stopping the U.S.'s aggressive acts in Taiwan and demanding that the U.S. withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait can the tension in the Taiwan area be eliminated, thereby helping to ensure peace in Asia and the security of the people of all countries. On the contrary, if the truth about the Taiwan situation is distorted, or if an attempt is made to disregard the fact that the United States is occupying Taiwan, it will only be to condone the U.S.'s aggressive behavior, and it will not be possible to ease the tension in the Taiwan area, and it will inevitably fuel the U.S.'s aggressive ambitions in Asia, making the situation even worse, seriously threatening the peace of the entire Asia and the security of the people of all countries.
    The justness of the Chinese people's cause of liberating Taiwan determines that the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan is unshakable, and any deception and intimidation are of no use. Those who are truly concerned about Asian peace and the security of the people of all countries should not try to adopt a policy of appeasement towards the aggressors, but should expose the aggressors and unite to stop the act of aggression.

    侵略者纵容不得

    最近，美国在多方设法给马尼拉条约装上“牙齿”的同时，又忙于“实施”美蒋“共同防御条约”，在台湾地区进行了紧张的活动。
    曼谷会议以后，从三月三日到五日，美国国务卿杜勒斯和一大群美国海、空军高级将领，齐集台湾，和蒋贼举行了“一次最大的战争会议”（合众社语），讨论了美蒋条约“生效”以后的一系列军事步骤。据各方透露，这些步骤是：第一，美国加紧部署它在台湾和台湾海峡的武装力量，以阻止中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿。第二，美国进一步扩充它在台湾的海军和空军基地，以加强它对台湾的占领。第三，美国加速和增加运送军舰、登陆艇、飞机和军用物资，来加强蒋贼的军事力量。第四，美国扩大它在台湾的庞大的“军事援助顾问团”，并建立美蒋“联合军事司令部”，以便由美国更直接地指挥和参与蒋介石卖国集团的军事活动。据美联社透露，在美蒋军事会议的议程中有一个项目是：讨论“大陆上的可能的目标”。与此同时，美国第七舰队和蒋贼海军在台湾举行了大规模的“联合演习”。他们公然把中国人民作为他们演习中假设的敌人。
    所有的这一切都突出地表明，美国正在台湾地区加紧武装侵略和战争准备。
    不仅这样，美国负责当局并一再对中国人民发出露骨的战争威胁。杜勒斯特地在美蒋条约“生效”的那一天发表声明说，只要美国认为中国人民的某些行动“构成了对台湾进攻的第一阶段”，那末美国的军事行动就将“不限于台湾本身”。三月八日，他又在华盛顿叫嚷，美国“保卫”台湾的行动
  “具有灵活性而且不一定限于静止地保卫”。这就是说，美国是打算着和中国人民开战，准备进攻中国大陆的。
    美国侵略集团及其追随者曾经谎说，美蒋条约是“纯粹防御性质的”，是“建立比较和平状况的步骤”，是为了“设法减少远东局势的危险性”。但是这些廉价的谎言已被今天的事实所完全揭穿了。所有的人都看到，美国正是利用美蒋条约的“实施”，加强了对台湾的武装占领，加紧了战争准备的步骤，加重了远东的紧张局势。
    而且，美国还正把它在台湾地区的活动同它在朝鲜和印度支那破坏和平的阴谋结合起来。杜勒斯一再表示，美国把印度支那、朝鲜和台湾的局势
  “看作是一个整体”，打算从这“三条战线”对中国人民进攻。这绝不是偶然的。它表明，今天的美国侵略集团不仅对它在中国的失败是不甘心的，同时对亚洲和平力量在朝鲜和印度支那所赢得的胜利，也是不甘心的。就是因为这样，美国正加紧武装侵略台湾，在那里制造和加剧紧张局势，以便寻找机会和借口来破坏远东的和平，准备在亚洲发动一场新的侵略战争。这一侵略战争主要是对着中国人民的，但同时也对着亚洲其他国家的人民。显而易见，美国这种狂妄的野心和积极的准备已经大大加深了亚洲的战争危机。
    在这样明显的事实面前，有人却仍竭力要替美国进行徒劳的掩饰。就在杜勒斯威胁说美国并不打算仅只“静止地保卫”台湾的同一天，艾登在英国下院说：“美国政府已经提供了肯定的证据，证明他们希望缓和紧张局势并减少战争危险”。究竟是什么证据呢？这种证据自然是没有的。人们现在看到的恰恰是相反的“证据”，这就是坚持强占别国领土，干涉别国内政，疯狂地进行战争威胁和侵略战争的准备。这一切当然是和“缓和紧张局势并减少战争危险”的“希望”水火不相容的。
    任何一个正直的人都会得出结论：只有制止美国在台湾的侵略行为，要求美国把它的一切武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤走，那末才会消除台湾地区的紧张局势，从而有助于保障亚洲的和平和各国人民的安全。反之，如果歪曲台湾局势的真相，或者是企图撇开美国侵占台湾的事实，那就只会是纵容美国的侵略行为，就不可能缓和台湾地区的紧张局势，而且必然会助长美国对亚洲的侵略野心，使局势更加恶化，严重威胁到整个亚洲和平和各国人民的安全。
    中国人民解放台湾事业的正义性决定了中国人民解放台湾的决心是无可动摇的，任何欺骗和恫吓都一概没有用处。真正关心亚洲和平和各国人民安全的人应当不是试图对侵略者采取绥靖政策，而应当是把侵略者揭发出来，大家一致来制止侵略的行为。
