Hu Feng: A "Practitioner" of Marxism or an Opponent of Marxism?
    Yang Er
    In his speech criticizing the "Literary Gazette," Hu Feng said, "There are two attitudes towards Marxism: one is the attitude of the academy, and the other is the attitude of the practitioner." Needless to say, Hu Feng considers himself to treat Marxism with the so-called "attitude of the practitioner," while many of his opponents, according to him, are so-called academics and dogmatists.
    What is the "attitude of the practitioner" that Hu Feng boasts about? Roughly speaking, it is that writers should learn in life through "artistic practice," "advance step by step, ascend, and reach the height of world view" (see "Hu Feng's Opinions on Literary Issues" - hereinafter referred to as "Opinions," page 36), or "elevate" Marxism, without having to seriously study Marxism.
    Hu Feng said that only this "artistic practice" path is the most correct way for writers to reach Marxism, and it is the road that truly "protects" art and the "basic laws of art."

    I. The "Artistic Practice" Hu Feng Speaks of is Idealistic "Artistic Practice"

    Everyone knows that Marxism has always advocated the unity of theory and practice, and insisted that one cannot learn Marxism without practice. Therefore, Hu Feng's method of expressing his extreme emphasis on "practice" makes some people think that he is indeed a Marxist, or that there are at least some Marxist elements in his propositions.
    However, people who have this idea will inevitably be fooled, because "practice" is not a term unique to Marxism. There is a materialist understanding of practice, and there is also an idealist understanding, and Hu Feng does not understand practice from a materialist point of view but from an idealist point of view.
    Now, let us look at the "practice" of this self-proclaimed Marxist "practitioner" from two aspects.
    The first aspect is that Hu Feng regards people's inner activities as the source of artistic creation.
    The "practice" Hu Feng speaks of often refers to "artistic practice," "creative practice," or "the practice of the unified process of life practice and creative practice."
    It must be pointed out here that "artistic practice" or "creative practice" can also be understood from a materialist point of view or from an idealist point of view. Materialist artistic practice starts from the point of view that real life is the only source of artistic creation, and believes that there is no other source besides this one. The "artistic practice" mentioned by idealism, no matter how deformed and disguised, ultimately regards people's inner activities as the source of artistic creation.
    Hu Feng said in his opinions on literary issues:
        "For a writer who is loyal to reality, a realist writer, the
    experience materials (subject matter) he gets from life, his understanding
    (thoughts) and emotional attitude towards it, must undergo a life-and-death
    struggle of mutual generation and mutual restraint in the creative process. In this
    struggle, the experience material shows its latent
    internal logic through the writer's flesh-and-blood pursuit, and the writer's understanding and emotional attitude (subjective world) are brought by that internal
    logic to new content or changes. Only then can the unity of the subjective and the objective be achieved, and a work be produced. ...
        "For the process of embodying or overcoming the object, on the side of the writer as the subject, it is also a process of constant self-expansion, a process of constant self-struggle. ...
    ... After such self-struggle, the writer can obtain
    self-expansion on the authenticity of historical requirements, this source of artistic creation." ("Opinions" pages 58-59)
    Hu Feng said that only through such a profound "practical struggle" did Balzac overcome the limitations of his reactionary world view, and Lu Xun further realized the cruel logic of class struggle, and so on. It can be seen that Hu Feng regards the writer's self-struggle, that is, the contradiction that occurs in the ideological and inner world, as the "practical struggle" of the "source of artistic creation."
    The "practice" mentioned by Marxism-Leninism mainly refers to people's material social production activities. "Marxists believe that human productive activity is the most basic practical activity" ("On Practice"). In addition to the struggle for production, people's social practice also includes class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic activities. But it always belongs to the activity of changing a certain natural process or changing a certain social process, that is, it always belongs to the activity of changing the material world. Materialist practice should be the practice of the unity of "knowledge" and "action", and it is believed that
  "knowledge" should serve "action", and "action" is the basis of "knowledge". However, it is not considered that "knowledge" is "action". However, Hu Feng even regards the contradiction movement in the thought process as the "practice" of the source of art. Then, in essence, it is admitting that as long as you "face the wall for ten years," that is, participate in the "practical struggle," you can also write great works of art. This is really not in common with Marxism-Leninism.
    Marxism-Leninism regards practice as the basis of the cognitive process and as the criterion for the truthfulness of cognition, precisely starting from the basic viewpoint of materialism, that is, matter is the primary phenomenon and consciousness is the secondary phenomenon. That is to say, only by participating in the struggle to change the material world (practice) can cognition be developed; and in order to check whether the cognition is in line with objective laws, it is necessary to rely on the results of changing the world (practice) to determine. Therefore, writers must go deep into life to participate in the struggle to change the world in order to deeply understand real life, and whether the writer's understanding is correct must be tested by the objective effect of his works. However, Hu Feng believes that the writer's conception process is the
  "source of artistic creation." Isn't this opposing existence determining consciousness, and advocating that consciousness and spirit themselves can create everything? Isn't this idealism?
    Secondly, let us further examine the artistic practice that Hu Feng speaks of, which is promoted by "subjective spirit."
    Marxism-Leninism believes that practice must be carried out under the guidance of correct theory and world view, while Hu Feng believes that "artistic practice" does not require the guidance of correct theory, as long as he emphasizes the so-called "subjective spirit" or "subjective fighting spirit."
    Hu Feng has made many different explanations for the so-called "subjective fighting spirit", but they are always nothing more than things like "wish," "enthusiasm," "request," or "emotional attitude." Hu Feng believes that the "subjective spirit" he speaks of is what the writer
  "draws" from the suffering and demands of the people. Hu Feng neither admits that it is the position or world view of any class, nor does he admit that it should be governed by any position and world view.
    However, what exactly are the "wishes," "enthusiasm," "requests," or "emotional attitudes" of the writer? In fact, aren't they determined by people's understanding of the objective world? Aren't they related to people's positions and world views?
    It can be seen from this that the "subjective spirit" that Hu Feng speaks of is actually still dominated by the writer's position and world view. However, the position and world view that dominate the "subjective spirit" are not the Marxist position and world view formed through conscious efforts, but the writer's spontaneously formed position and world view.
    The spontaneously formed position and world view of modern intellectual writers who grew up in a class society can never be the proletariat, but can only belong to the ideological system of the bourgeoisie. Even after many writers politically tend to the working class, but because they have not seriously studied Marxism-Leninism and transformed themselves, their world view is still the bourgeois ideological system, and their understanding of real life is actually chaotic and blind. Hu Feng uses "subjective spirit" to oppose the Marxist world view, and his purpose is to allow writers to understand and reflect life according to their blind and chaotic understanding of real life. And Hu Feng believes that this can enable writers to correctly understand and reflect life. Isn't this deceiving people? For example, a hero who sacrifices for the liberation of the working class can be endowed with an immortal artistic image, but can also be written by a writer who is "sincere" and "enthusiastic" about the petty-bourgeois mood as an object that can only arouse people's sadness, and can also be written by a writer who is "sincere" and "enthusiastic" about the bourgeois world view as a fool or a thug. Isn't Lu Ling such a writer the most "subjective fighting spirit" writer Hu Feng speaks of? Why did writing the psychology of workers as the psychology of morbid intellectuals not make "realism" win?
    It can be seen from this that the "practice" under the promotion of "subjective spirit" that Hu Feng speaks of is blind "practice." This is the first point.
    Hu Feng calls on writers to use "subjective spirit" to "grasp" and "conquer" the object, and "fight" with the object, saying that this is a "life-and-death practical struggle," saying that this is the process of "unity of the subjective and the objective." What exactly is going on here?
    In fact, this is to allow writers to conduct self-righteous and blind selection and explanation of the materials observed from life with a self-righteous and blind enthusiasm. Since their understanding of the laws of social development and the internal laws of real life is still often full of contradictions and chaos, this kind of selection and explanation must also be full of contradictions and chaos. In this way, how can the writer's subjective and objective
  "unify"?
    However, Hu Feng believes that it can be "unified", and this is to go through "fighting" and "mutual generation and mutual restraint", which is actually to allow the writer to distort the objective according to his own subjectivity. If we look again at how Hu Feng praised Shu Wu's "On Subjectivity," this point can be made clearer. In "On Subjectivity," Shu Wu promoted that "subjective action" can be "unobstructed", and promoted that the "great universe" has a "nature", that is, the so-called "heart of heaven." Hu Feng praised this extremely crude and exposed propaganda of idealism as "a problem that will affect the struggle for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation." Since Hu Feng agrees to emphasize the role of subjectivity to have the ability of "unobstructed", then isn't this idealism?
    It can be seen from this that the "practice" under the promotion of "subjective spirit" that Hu Feng speaks of is to allow writers to arbitrarily distort real life according to their own subjectivity. This is the second point.
    Since Hu Feng agrees that the role of subjectivity can be "unobstructed," and that inner struggle is considered "practice," here we also find the philosophical basis for his "where there is life, there is struggle." Because, as long as the "subjective spirit" is raised and "burned" up, all problems in artistic creation can be easily solved, then why emphasize going deep into life? Similarly, if a writer wants to use artistic weapons to serve the class struggle waged by the proletariat, he does not need to participate in the practice of class struggle, because Hu Feng has not said,
  "As long as there are things that have not become extinct on the earth (life or subject matter), it must contain the corresponding ideological class struggle significance"? ("Opinions" page 108).
    It can be seen from this that the "practice" under the promotion of "subjective spirit" that Hu Feng speaks of is the idealistic "practice" that cancels social practice. This is the third point.
    As long as there is blind enthusiasm, life can be reflected correctly; as long as one thinks it is correct, one can arbitrarily distort reality; without participating in class struggle, one can write artistic works with "the significance of class struggle"; in short, as long as there is inner activity, there is a "source of artistic creation"! This is the wonderful use of "subjective spirit." But it is obviously also the wonderful use of idealism. Because, spirit, objective existence, in the view of idealism, is originally the same thing, that is, the so-called "my heart is the universe, and the universe is my heart."
    Since we oppose Hu Feng's "subjective spirit," are we, as Hu Feng's faction said, "mechanists" who deny the active role of cognition and the active role of subjectivity? Regarding the active role of cognition and the active role of subjectivity, we not only fully admit it, but also advocate actively developing it. However, the so-called active role of cognition is incomprehensible if it is separated from social practice. Because in the final analysis, cognition must be based on empirical materials. Even religious figures, the various gods they created are actually modeled on humans or things in the objective world. Although they twisted them, they finally couldn't get rid of them fundamentally. If this kind of cognitive activity is used in practice, it is nothing more than using the objective laws that have been recognized to seek welfare for people. This subjective creative role will only achieve the expected effect when it correctly reflects the laws of objective things. Studying gas mechanics and trying to manufacture airplanes, this kind of activity can be realized; trying hard to turn people into birds, this kind of activity cannot be realized. Therefore, the active role of subjectivity, in terms of its source and the scope of its role, is a product of material movement, and cannot transcend the laws of the objective world. However, the "subjective role" that Hu Feng speaks of both denies its material basis, that is, it believes that it can be produced independently of practice, and believes that it is "unobstructed", which in essence means it can be "as one pleases." What common ground can this idealistic "subjective role" have with the Marxist subjective role?

    II. Hu Feng Advocates "Learning Marxism in Life," which is Actually Inducing Writers to Grope in the Dark

    Since Hu Feng's "artistic practice" is idealistic "practice," if writers follow the direction he points out to "practice," it is clear that not only will they not move towards Marxism, but they will only move further and further away from Marxism.
    However, Hu Feng also proves his so-called "learning from life" argument from another aspect. He said that writers can "elevate" Marxism "due to the lessons of facts." He said that if this is denied, "there will be no historical materialism in the world" ("On the Road of Realism," page 80).
    In fact, what Hu Feng repeatedly emphasized is that writers do not need to study Marxism-Leninism, but should blindly grope in life, and thereby "reach the Marxist world view."
    Do Marxists not advocate learning in life and in practice? On the contrary, Marxists have always believed that it is necessary to learn in connection with practice, and that cognition separated from practice is impossible. However, what we advocate is the close connection between theory and practice, and one-sidedly emphasizing learning in practice and completely denying the extremely important role of theory is anti-Marxist.
    Some intellectuals and writers who are closer to the working people, because they are less affected by the prejudices of the exploiting classes and retain more of the qualities of the working people, have participated in social struggles, immersed themselves in the fiery struggles of the people in the creative process, and objectively observed various phenomena of social life, and learned lessons from the facts, it is possible to gradually approach the Marxist position. Because Marxism is an understanding of the original appearance of the objective world, some Marxist viewpoints can be realized from their own social practice by working people and their intellectuals who do not have prejudices. Moreover, in Chinese society since the "May Fourth" Movement, Marxist propagandists with the Chinese Communist Party as the core are active everywhere, and various Marxist propaganda materials and publications are scattered everywhere. It is actually impossible for writers to "grope on their own" without being influenced by these propagandists and publications.
    However, there is a limit to learning Marxism from life based on one's own observations. Because Marxism is the complete world view of the working class, Lenin pointed out in "What is to be Done?" that this modern socialist consciousness can only be produced based on profound scientific knowledge, and it was achieved through the great research work of the working class's great thinkers. This world view must break most thoroughly with the various concepts inherited from the past. Any modern writer who grows up in a class society, if he does not go through serious study and the training of practical struggle, even if he declares that he already has a Marxist world view, he often does not really have this world view.
    Why can't writers in class society spontaneously form a Marxist world view even if they are willing? Lenin's words when analyzing that the spontaneous movement of workers always tends to be dominated by the bourgeois ideological system are also applicable here to a certain extent. He said: "The bourgeois ideological system has a much longer history than the socialist ideological system, has been refined more carefully, and has far more means of communication." (Lenin: "What is to be Done?") Naturally, intellectuals and the working class are different. The oppressed working class does not have the time and means to study science because of the heavy labor, so they cannot create scientific socialism. Therefore, intellectuals have a foundation of more scientific knowledge. However, the working class spontaneously tends towards socialism, and the workers' movement is still affected by the bourgeois ideological system, so intellectuals generally receive more influence from bourgeois thought. Is it easier for intellectuals to acquire a Marxist world view than for the working class?
    Hu Feng often cites Lu Xun as an example, saying that he became a Marxist by groping in life. In fact, Lu Xun not only had close contacts with communists, but as long as you see how seriously Lu Xun translated Marxist art theory books, you can see his attitude towards learning Marxist theory. Hu Feng forcibly used Lu Xun as an example, but it was a distortion of the facts. This kind of distortion proves that Hu Feng's advocacy of this path of groping in the dark is by no means merely ignorance, but is to stubbornly insist on spreading his own idealistic literary and artistic theory to replace the guidance of Marxism on the revolutionary literary and artistic movement.

    III. The Task of Hu Feng's "Theory" is to Oppose the Leadership of Marxism-Leninism over the Literary and Artistic Movement and the Chinese Revolution

    Why, in today's world where the Marxist world view has been fully proven to be the most powerful weapon to help writers improve their artistic careers, does Hu Feng try so hard to advocate that writers abandon the study of Marxism and take the path of groping in the dark? Why does Hu Feng still advocate taking the Balzac-style path today?
    The essence of Hu Feng's proposition, in addition to the reason for trying to reduce the position of Marxist thought and trying to expand the position of bourgeois thought, is difficult to have other appropriate explanations.
    Our advocacy of writers seriously studying Marxism-Leninism and mastering the world view of the proletariat is neither because we believe that writers only need to have Marxist-Leninist book knowledge, and do not need to go deep into life to improve their artistic accomplishment to be able to write good works, nor because we believe that a writer who is willing to serve the people cannot write well without learning Marxism-Leninism. Our advocacy of writers striving to master the Marxist world view is not to require every writer to become a social scientist proficient in Marxism at the same time.
    We are only saying that mastering the Marxist world view and studying Marxism-Leninism will produce extremely beneficial results for writers' labor. And not understanding Marxism-Leninism will inevitably limit the development of his talent, and may make his talent develop in the wrong direction.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "What we feel, we cannot understand it immediately, and only what we understand can we feel it more deeply." This sentence can be used to explain the significance of studying Marxism-Leninism for writers' labor, and it can also be used to explain the significance of logical thinking for image thinking. The Marxist-Leninist world view can help writers correctly and deeply understand real life, so Gorky called it the "intellectual peak" that helps writers "stand high and see far." And writers who mainly rely on image thinking to carry out labor, if they do not understand the object they want to feel, the things they can feel will become impoverished in terms of content and form, and even errors will occur.
    For example, writers who lack Marxist-Leninist knowledge, some will fantasize or describe peasants as natural collectivists, while others, after seeing the private-owner side of peasants, mistakenly believe that peasants cannot be transformed into socialist laborers. However, if he studies Lenin's theoretical works on the duality of peasants, he will not make the above-mentioned two kinds of mistakes, and it will be easier for him to penetrate into the inner world of peasants when observing peasant life. The experience of the Soviet writer, Nikolai Yeva, the author of "Harvest," is a powerful proof. She has received powerful help from the works of Lenin and Stalin on the peasant question.
    Marxism-Leninism, in helping writers understand major historical themes, can help them expand their horizons and deepen their understanding, and can help them most effectively select and process those most essential facts without being overwhelmed by the sea of materials or being confused by superficial appearances. In the work of shaping typical images, Marxism-Leninism not only helps him generate proper and enthusiastic love and hatred for them, but also helps him have the most keen sense for those concrete and most infectious details that should be concentrated.
    However, Hu Feng would say that Balzac had not studied Marxism-Leninism, but it did not prevent him from becoming a great realist writer.
    Naturally, due to historical limitations, Balzac did not know Marxism. However, Balzac was by no means a blind writer who wrote solely on "subjective spirit" as Hu Feng imagined. As Engels pointed out, Balzac's profound understanding of real social relations is the reason why he became a great realist.
    Here, we want to ask Hu Feng two questions: First, how can the level of human understanding in Balzac's era be compared with that after the emergence of Marxism? Marxism is a leap in human understanding of the objective world. Why does Hu Feng insist on pulling us back to Balzac's era today and abandoning the sharp weapon of Marxism? Second, what a leap is today's people's attitude towards literary works compared to Balzac's era? Today's people call writers "engineers of the soul" and regard works as textbooks for their lives. Why does Hu Feng have writers with such important tasks grope in the dark, making them unable to most quickly improve their works to the level required by the people?
    Hu Feng's "theory" of advocating writers to "rise" to Marxism by groping in the dark, in a certain sense, can be compared with the opportunist theory of economism that Lenin had relentlessly exposed. They are completely the same in denying the ideological leadership of the Party and denying the importance of theory, in worshiping spontaneity and advocating groping forward; they are even more consistent in expanding the influence of bourgeois thought and reducing the position of Marxism. Naturally, they are also different. The theory of economism is a bourgeois theory in the entire workers' movement, while Hu Feng's "spontaneity theory" is a bourgeois theory in the workers' class literary and artistic movement.
    Hu Feng is not only trying to make the revolutionary literary and artistic movement break away from the leadership of Marxism-Leninism, but also to make the entire people's revolutionary movement break away from the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. This is the essence of Hu Feng's "spontaneity theory."
    Hu Feng said in "Requiem" ("Time Begins" Fourth Movement):
    "Our struggle and labor can only have one starting point
    That is the working people's
    Humble love or desire
    Humble hatred or pain
    Our future road
    Can only be elevated from there and gathered together
    It must not be separated from those integrated
    Cold truths added to them from outside"
    These verses tell us: First, Hu Feng opposes the people's desire to the theory that can correctly reflect the development of social material life needs. He does not understand that correct theory is precisely the scientific expression of the people's desire, so he believes that the only basis for leading the revolutionary struggle is the people's desire, and cannot be the laws of social development; second, since Marxism is not a scientific theory produced in the struggle of the working people, but the "cold truths" that Hu Feng speaks of, according to Hu Feng's theory, it naturally cannot be regarded as the "starting point of struggle and labor."
    What kind of thought is this promoting? Isn't this opposing the leadership of Marxism-Leninism over the Chinese revolution? Advocating the spontaneity and blindness of mass struggle, opposing the led and organized mass revolutionary struggle, and opposing the Communist Party and Marxist-Leninist thought's leadership over the Chinese revolution, this is the main goal for which Hu Feng has striven in theory.
    For some people who have been deceived by Hu Feng, we want to tell them: Hu Feng's thought is extremely cunning and dangerous. Wearing the cloak of Marxism and peddling bourgeois reactionary thoughts, if we do not carefully distinguish, we will be confused by some of his words and individual views containing correct elements, and fall into the quagmire without being aware of it.
    Since the task of Hu Feng's thought and theory is such, then, he is not a practitioner of Marxism, but an opponent of Marxism. Is there any doubt about that?

### 胡风是马克思主义的“实践者”呢，还是马克思主义的反对者？

    胡风是马克思主义的“实践者”呢，还是马克思主义的反对者？
    杨耳
    胡风在批评“文艺报”的发言中，说“对于马克思主义，有两种态度”，“一个是学院派的态度，另一个是实践者的态度”。不言而喻，胡风是自命为用所谓“实践者的态度”来对待马克思主义的，而他的许多反对者，照他说来，就是所谓学院派和教条主义者。
    什么是胡风所吹嘘的“实践者的态度”呢？大致说来，就是认为作家应该通过“艺术实践”，在生活里学习，“一步一步前进，上升，一直达到世界观的高度”（见“胡风对文艺问题的意见”——以下简称“意见”第三六页），或“提升”出马克思主义来，而不必去认真地学习马克思主义。
    胡风说只有这一条“艺术实践”的路才是作家达到马克思主义最正确的道路，并且是真正“保护”艺术和“艺术的基本规律”的道路。
    一、胡风所说的“艺术实践”是唯心主义的“艺术实践”
    谁都知道，马克思主义从来主张理论和实践的统一，并且主张不能离开实践去学习马克思主义。因此，胡风这种表示自己极端重视“实践”的手法，就使有些人以为他确实是马克思主义者，或者，他的主张中至少是有着一些马克思主义的因素的。
    但是，有这样想法的人不免上当了，因为“实践”并不是马克思主义独有的术语，对于实践有唯物主义的了解，也有唯心主义的了解，而胡风恰恰不是从唯物主义的观点而是从唯心主义的观点来了解实践的。
    现在，就让我们从两个方面来看看这位自命为马克思主义“实践者”的“实践”吧。
    第一个方面，胡风是把人们的内心活动当作艺术创造的源泉的。
    胡风所说的“实践”经常是指着“艺术实践”、
  “创作实践”，或“生活实践和创作实践统一过程的实践”。
    这里必须指出：“艺术实践”或“创作实践”，也是既可以从唯物主义的观点来了解，又可以从唯心主义的观点来了解的。唯物主义的艺术实践，是从这样的观点出发的，即把现实生活看作艺术创造的唯一的源泉，并认为除了这一源泉就别无其它的源泉。唯心主义所说的“艺术实践”，不管如何变形和掩饰，归根结底，是把人们的内心活动当做艺术创造的源泉。
    胡风在对文艺问题的意见中说：
        “对于一个忠实于现实的作家，现实主义的作家，他的从生
    活得来的经验材料（素材），他的对于它的理解（思想）和感情
    态度，要在创作过程中进行一场相生相克的决死的斗争。在这个
    斗争过程中间，经验材料通过作家底血肉追求而显示出了它的潜
    伏的内在逻辑，作家底理解和感情态度（主观世界）又被那内在
    逻辑带来了新的内容或变化，这才达到了主观和客观的统一，产
    生了作品。……
        “对于对象的体现过程或克服过程，在作为主体的作家这一
    面，同时也就是不断的自我扩张过程，不断的自我斗争过程。…
    …经过了这样的自我斗争，作家才能够在历史要求底真实性上得
    到自我扩张，这艺术创造底源泉。”（“意见”第五八—五九页）
    胡风说，只有通过这样深刻的“实践斗争”，巴尔扎克才克服了自己反动世界观的限制，鲁迅就进一步认识到了阶级斗争的残酷的逻辑等等。可见胡风是把作家的自我斗争，即发生在思想、内心世界里的矛盾，当作是“艺术创造底源泉”的“实践斗争”的。
    马克思列宁主义所说的“实践”，主要就是指着人们物质的社会生产活动。“马克思主义者认为人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动”（“实践论”）。人的社会实践，除了生产斗争，还包含了阶级斗争、政治生活、科学和艺术活动。但它总是属于变革某一自然过程或变革某一社会过程的活动，即总是属于变革物质世界的活动。唯物主义的实践应是“知”和“行”统一的实践，而且认为
  “知”应该为“行”服务，“行”是“知”的基础。但是，也不是认为“知”即是“行”。而胡风竟然把发生在思想过程中的矛盾运动当做艺术源泉的“实践”。那么，实质上就是承认只要“面壁十年”，也就是参加了“实践斗争”，也可以写出伟大的艺术作品来了。这实在是和马克思列宁主义没有共同之点的。
    马克思列宁主义把实践当做认识过程的基础，当做认识的真理性的标准，正是从唯物论的基本观点，即物质是第一性的现象、意识是第二性的现象出发的。这就是说，只有参加变革物质世界的斗争
  （实践），才能使认识得到发展；而为了检查认识的是否符合客观规律性，只有靠变革世界（实践）的结果来判明。因此，作家必须深入到生活中去参加变革世界的斗争，才能深入地认识现实生活，而作家的认识是否正确，必须依靠他的作品的客观效果来检验。可是，胡风认为作家的构思过程就是
  “艺术创造底源泉”。这不就是反对存在决定意识，而主张意识、精神自身就能创造一切吗？这不就是唯心主义吗？
    第二个方面，我们再进而考察一下胡风所说的用“主观精神”来推动的艺术实践。
    马克思列宁主义认为实践必须在正确的理论和世界观的指导下去进行，而胡风认为“艺术实践”并不要正确理论的指导，只要强调所谓“主观精神”或“主观战斗精神”。
    胡风对于所谓“主观战斗精神”，作了很多种不同的解释，但总不外说它是“愿望”、“热情”、
  “要求”、“感情态度”之类的东西。胡风认为他所说的“主观精神”是作家从人民的痛苦和要求中
  “汲取”出来的。胡风既不承认它是什么阶级的立场或世界观，也不承认它应该受什么立场和世界观的支配。
    可是，作家这种“愿望”、“热情”、“要求”、或“感情态度”之类的东西，究竟是什么东西呢？实际上，难道它们不是由于人们对客观世界的认识所决定的吗？难道不是和人们的立场、世界观联系着的吗？
    由此可见，胡风所说的“主观精神”实际上还是受着作家立场和世界观的支配。不过支配“主观精神”的立场和世界观，不是经过自觉的努力而形成的马克思主义的立场和世界观，而是作家自发形成的立场和世界观而已。
    在阶级社会里生长的现代知识分子作家，其自发形成的立场世界观，总不可能是无产阶级的，而只能是属于资产阶级思想体系的。甚至许多作家在政治上倾向工人阶级之后，但由于没有认真学习马克思列宁主义并改造自己，他的世界观仍然是资产阶级思想体系的，他们对现实生活的理解实际上是混乱的、盲目的。胡风用“主观精神”来和马克思主义世界观对立，其目的就是要作家按照自己对现实生活盲目的、混乱的理解，来认识和反映生活。而胡风认为这样就能使作家正确地认识和反映生活了。这难道不是骗人吗？举个例子吧，一个为工人阶级解放而牺牲的英雄，可以被赋予永垂不朽的艺术形象，但也可以被对小资产阶级心情“真诚”和“热情”的作家写成一个只能引起人们伤感的对象，也可以被对于资产阶级世界观“真诚”、“热情”的作家写成一个傻子或暴徒。难道路翎这样的作家不是胡风所说的最具有“主观战斗精神”的作家吗？为什么把工人心理写成了病态知识分子的心理而并没有使“现实主义”获得胜利呢？
    由此可见，胡风所说的“主观精神”推动下的“实践”，就是盲目的“实践”。这是第一点。
    胡风号召作家用“主观精神”去“把握”和“征服”对象，和对象“搏斗”，说这是一场“你死我活的实践斗争”，说这是“主观和客观统一”的过程。这究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    实际上，这就是让作家本着自以为是的、盲目的热情，对于从生活中观察得来的材料，进行自以为是地、盲目地选择和解释。他们对于社会发展的规律和现实生活的内在法则的理解既然还常常是充满矛盾和混乱的，因而这种选择和解释也必然是充满矛盾和混乱的。这样，作家的主观和客观怎样能够
  “统一”呢？
    但是，胡风认为是可以“统一”的，这就是要经过“搏斗”，经过“相生相克”，其实就是让作家来按照自己的主观来歪曲客观而已。如果我们再看胡风怎样称赞舒芜的“论主观”，这一点就更可以明白了。舒芜在“论主观”里宣传“主观作用”可以“所向无阻”，宣传“大宇宙”有个“本性”即所谓“天心”。胡风对于这种极端粗暴露骨的唯心主义宣传，却称赞为“一个使中华民族求新生的斗争会受影响的问题”。胡风既然赞成把主观作用强调到有“所向无阻”的能力，那么，这不是唯心主义是什么？
    由此可见，胡风所说的“主观精神”推动下的
  “实践”，就是容许作家凭着自己的主观去任意歪曲现实生活。这是第二点。
    胡风既然赞成主观作用可以“所向无阻”，而且内心斗争就算是“实践”，这里我们也就找到他的“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”的哲学根据了。因为，只要“主观精神”高扬起来，“燃烧”起来，艺术创造中的一切问题都可以迎刃而解了，那么，又何必去强调深入生活呢？同样，如果作家要用艺术的武器去为无产阶级进行的阶级斗争服务，也无须参加阶级斗争的实践的，因为，胡风不是说过，
  “只要是在地球上还没有绝迹的东西（生活或题材），就一定包含有相应的思想上的阶级斗争底意义”吗？（“意见”第一○八页）。
    由此可见：胡风所说的“主观精神”推动下的
  “实践”，就是取消社会实践的唯心主义的“实践”。这是第三点。
    只要盲目的热情，就能正确地反映生活；只要自以为正确，就可以随意歪曲现实；不参加阶级斗争，却能写出有“阶级斗争的意义”的艺术作品；总之，只要有内心活动，就有“艺术创造的源泉”！这就是“主观精神”的妙用。但显然也是唯心主义的妙用。因为，精神，客观存在，照唯心主义看来，本来就是一个东西，即所谓“吾心便是宇宙，宇宙便是吾心”。
    我们既然反对胡风这种“主观精神”，是否我们就像胡风派所说的那样，都是否认认识的能动作用、主观的能动作用的“机械论”者呢？对于认识的能动作用和主观能动作用，我们不仅完全承认，而且主张积极地加以发挥。但是，所谓认识的能动作用，如果离开了社会的实践，就是不可理解的。因为归根到底，认识终究必须以经验材料为依据。即令是宗教家吧，他们所创造的各式各样的神，实际还是用人或客观世界中的事物作范本的。尽管他们扭曲了它们，但终于无法根本脱离它们。如果把这种认识能动性用之于实践，也无非是利用已被认识的客观法则来为人们谋福利罢了。这种主观的创造作用，只有当它正确反映客观事物的规律性的时候，才会收到预期的效果。研究气体力学，设法来制造飞机，这种能动性是可以实现的；努力想把人变成鸟，这种能动性是不能实现的。所以，主观能动作用，就其来源和起作用的范围来说，都是物质运动的产物，都不能超越客观世界的规律性之外。而胡风所说的“主观作用”既否认它的物质的基础，即认为它是可以脱离实践而产生的，又认为它是“所向无阻”的，实质上也即可以“随心所欲”的。这种唯心主义的“主观作用”和马克思主义的主观作用，能有什么共同之点呢？
    二、胡风提倡“在生活中学习马克思主义”，实际上是劝诱作家在暗中摸索
    胡风的“艺术实践”既然是唯心主义的“实践”，如果作家按照他指出的方向去“实践”，显然不仅不能走向马克思主义，而且只会愈来愈离开马克思主义。
    但是，胡风又从另一个方面，来证明他的所谓“从生活中学习”马克思主义的论点。他说作家可以“由于事实的教训”而提升出马克思主义来的。他说，如果否认这一点，“世界上就不会有什么历史唯物论”（“论现实主义的路”第八○页）了。
    实际上，胡风再三强调的，就是认为作家不必学习马克思列宁主义，而应该到生活中去盲目摸索，并由此而“达到马克思主义的世界观”。
    难道马克思列宁主义者不主张在生活中、在实际中学习么；相反，马克思主义者从来认为必须联系着实际去学习，而且认为离开了实践的认识是不可能的。但是，我们主张的是理论和实际的密切联系，片面强调在实践中学习，根本否认理论的极端重要的作用，就是反马克思主义的。
    某些比较接近劳动人民的知识分子和作家，由于所受剥削阶级的偏见的影响较少，劳动人民的品质保留得较多，他们参加了社会斗争，在创作过程中，投身于人民火热的斗争里，又客观地观察了社会生活的各种现象，并从中得到事实的教训，是有可能逐步接近马克思主义的立场的。因为马克思主义是对于客观世界本来面目的了解，所以，马克思主义的某一些观点，对于不存偏见的劳动人民和他们的知识分子，是能够从自己所经历的社会实践中体会出来的。何况，在“五四”以来的中国社会里，到处活动着以中国共产党为核心的马克思主义的宣传者，到处散布着各种马克思主义的宣传品和出版物，作家们即使想要“自己摸索”而不受这些宣传者和出版物的影响，实际上是不可能的。
    但是，从生活中凭着自己的观察来学习马克思主义，是有着限度的。因为，马克思主义是工人阶级完整的世界观，列宁在“做什么？”中就指出这种现代社会主义的意识，只有根据深刻的科学知识才能产生出来，它是经过工人阶级伟大的思想家的巨大的研究工作才达到的。这一世界观要同过去遗传下来的种种观念实行最彻底的决裂。任何一个在阶级社会中生长的现代作家，如果不经过认真的学习和实践斗争的锻炼，尽管自己宣布已经具有马克思主义的世界观，其实常常是并没有真正具有这种世界观的。
    为什么阶级社会中的作家尽管自己愿意，也不能自发地形成马克思主义的世界观呢？列宁在分析工人的自发运动总是倾向受资产阶级思想体系支配时所说的话，在一定意义上在这里也是适用的。他说：“资产阶级的思想体系，其渊源要比社会主义的思想体系久远得多，其所受过的制炼也较为周到，其所拥有的传播工具也更多得无比。”（列宁：“做什么？”）自然，知识分子和工人阶级是不同的，被压迫的工人阶级因为沉重的劳动使得他们没有时间和手段来研究科学，因而不能创造出科学的社会主义，那么，知识分子是有着较多的科学知识的基础的。可是，工人阶级是自发地倾向于社会主义的，而工人运动仍要受到资产阶级思想体系的影响，那么，知识分子接受资产阶级思想的影响，一般就更要多得多了。知识分子获得马克思主义世界观难道会比工人阶级更容易一些么？
    胡风常常举出鲁迅为例，说他是在生活中摸索而变成马克思主义者的。其实，鲁迅不仅和共产党人有密切地交往，而且只要看到鲁迅如何认真地翻译马克思主义的艺术理论书籍，就可以看到他对于学习马克思主义理论的态度了。胡风强以鲁迅为例，不过是歪曲事实而已。这种歪曲，就证明了胡风提倡这条暗中摸索的道路决不仅仅是无知，而是要顽强地坚持散布自己唯心主义的文艺理论，来代替马克思主义对革命文学艺术运动的指导。
    三、胡风的“理论”的任务，就是反对马克思列宁主义对文艺运动和中国革命运动的领导
    为什么在马克思主义世界观已经完全被证明是能够帮助作家提高他们艺术事业最有力的武器的今天，胡风却竭力提倡作家抛弃对马克思主义的学习而走暗中摸索的道路呢？为什么直到今天胡风还提倡走巴尔扎克式的道路呢？
    胡风这种主张的实质，除去为了竭力缩小马克思主义思想的阵地，和竭力扩大资产阶级思想阵地这一理由，是很难有其它恰当的解释的。
    我们主张作家认真学习马克思列宁主义，掌握无产阶级的世界观，既不是认为作家只要有马克思列宁主义的书本知识，不需要深入生活，提高自己的艺术修养，就能够写出好的作品，也不是认为一个愿意为人民服务的作家，不学好马克思列宁主义就不能写作。我们主张作家努力掌握马克思主义世界观，更不是要求每一个作家同时成为一个精通马克思主义的社会科学家。
    我们只是说，掌握马克思主义世界观，学习马克思列宁主义，对于作家的劳动，就会产生极有益的结果。而不懂马克思列宁主义，就必然会限制他的才能的发展，并有可能使他的才能发展到错误的方向去。
    毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说：“感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。”这句话可以用来说明学习马克思列宁主义对于作家劳动的意义，也可以用来说明逻辑思维对于形象思维的意义。马克思列宁主义世界观可以帮助作家正确而深刻地认识现实生活，所以高尔基称它为帮助作家“站得高、看得远”的“理智高峰”。而主要依靠形象思维进行劳动的作家，如果对于他要感觉的对象不理解，他能感觉到的东西，就会从内容到形式都变得贫乏起来，甚至会发生谬误。
    举个例子说，缺少马克思列宁主义知识的作家，有的会把农民幻想或描写成为天生的集体主义者，有的却又在看到农民私有者的一面之后，错误地认为农民是不能改造成为社会主义的劳动者的。但是，如果他研究了列宁关于农民两重性的理论著作，就不会犯上述两方面的错误，并便于他在观察农民生活的时候深入他们的内心世界。苏联的作家，“收获”的作者尼古拉也娃的经验，就是有力的证明，她曾得到列宁斯大林关于农民问题著作的有力的帮助。
    马克思列宁主义，在帮助作家理解重大的历史题材时，可以帮助他们扩张自己的眼界和加深理解的程度，并能帮助他们最有效果地选择、处理那些最具有本质意义的事实，而不被材料的海洋淹没，或被表面的假象所迷惑。在塑造典型形象的工作上，马克思列宁主义不仅帮助他对它们产生正当的热烈的爱憎，而且帮助他对于那些应该集中起来的、具体的、最有感染力的细节，具有最锐敏的感觉。
    可是，胡风会说，巴尔扎克没有学过马克思列宁主义，但并没有阻止他成为伟大的现实主义作家。
    自然，由于历史的限制，巴尔扎克还不知道马克思主义。但是，巴尔扎克也决不是像胡风所想像的那样单凭“主观精神”写作的盲目的作家。正如恩格斯所指出的，巴尔扎克对现实社会关系具有深刻的理解，这才是他之所以成为伟大的现实主义者的理由。
    这里，我们要问胡风两个问题：第一，巴尔扎克的时代，人类的认识水平怎能和马克思主义出现以后相比呢？马克思主义是人类对客观世界认识上的飞跃，胡风为什么在今天偏要把我们拉回到巴尔扎克的时代，抛弃马克思主义这个锐利武器不用呢？第二，今天人民对于文学作品的态度，比起巴尔扎克时代，又是怎样的一个飞跃？今天的人民，把作家称作“灵魂的工程师”，把作品当作自己生活的教科书，胡风为什么偏要负有如此重大任务的作家去暗中摸索，使他们不能最快捷地把自己的作品提高到人民要求的水平呢？
    胡风提倡作家凭着自己在暗中摸索而“上升”到马克思主义的这种“理论”，在一定意义上，是可以和列宁曾无情揭穿的经济主义的机会主义的理论相比的。它们在否认党的思想领导和否认理论的重要性方面，在崇拜自发性、主张摸索前进这一方面，是完全一样的；在扩大资产阶级思想影响、缩小马克思主义阵地这一点上，更是完全一致的。自然，它们又是有差别的，经济主义的理论是整个工人运动中的资产阶级理论，而胡风的“自发论”则是工人阶级文学艺术运动中的资产阶级的理论。
    胡风不仅是要使革命的文艺运动脱离马克思列宁主义的领导，而且要使整个人民革命运动也摆脱马克思列宁主义的领导，这正是胡风“自发论”思想的根本。
    胡风在“安魂曲”（“时间开始了”第四乐篇）中说：
    “我们的斗争和劳动只能够有一个起点
    那就是劳动人民底
    卑微的爱情或愿望
    卑微的仇恨或痛苦
    我们的未来的道路
    只能够从那里提升起来汇集起来
    决不能是不和那些结成一体的
    从身外加给他们的冷情的道理”
    这些诗句告诉我们：第一，胡风把人民的愿望和能够正确反映社会物质生活发展的需要的理论对立起来。他不理解正确的理论正是人民愿望的科学的表现，因而他认为领导革命斗争唯一的依据只是人民的愿望，而不能是社会发展的规律；第二，马克思主义既然不是劳动人民斗争中产生的科学理论，而是胡风所说的“冷情的道理”，照胡风的理论看来，自然决不能当做“斗争和劳动的起点”了。
    这是宣传什么思想呢？这不就是反对马克思列宁主义对中国革命的领导吗？鼓吹群众斗争的自发性，盲目性，反对有领导、有组织的群众革命斗争，反对共产党和马克思列宁主义思想对中国革命的领导，这就是胡风在理论上所为之奋斗的主要目标。
    对于一些被胡风欺骗了的人，我们要告诉他们：胡风的思想是极端狡猾危险的。披着马克思主义的外衣，贩卖资产阶级的反动思想，如果我们不细加辨别，就会被他某些词句和包含有正确因素的个别观点所迷惑，陷入泥坑而不自觉的。
    胡风的思想和理论的任务既是如此，那么，他并不是马克思主义的实践者，而是马克思主义的反对者，难道还有疑义么？
