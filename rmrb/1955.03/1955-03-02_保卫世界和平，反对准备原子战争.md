Soviet young men and women, like millions of other young people in other countries, are doing their utmost to defend peace and the security of all nations. They are willing to live peacefully, to study and work for their own happiness and the happiness of their people. Soviet youth will work even harder and more enthusiastically in the future to strengthen the power of our great motherland, and to create more labor achievements in the peaceful construction of industry, agriculture, and all departments of our country.
