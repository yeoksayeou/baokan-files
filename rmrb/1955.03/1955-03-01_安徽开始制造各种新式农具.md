Anhui Province's locally state-owned agricultural machinery and implement factories plan to manufacture many new types of farm implements for farmers this year. These include 27,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 1,000 double-wheeled single-shared plows, 1,126 disc harrows, more than 3,000 sweet potato slicers, more than 4,000 waterwheels, 70 weeding machines, as well as cotton gins and cotton rollers.

The double-wheeled double-shared plows this year are manufactured according to the centrally unified standard drawings. The materials and structure have been strengthened, and the parts on the plows can even be used interchangeably. In order to manufacture a batch of double-wheeled double-shared plows in the first quarter and supply them to farmers for spring plowing, the factories completed the sample trial production work at the end of last year. After appraisal by various departments, it was considered that the specifications and quality of the trial-produced double-wheeled double-shared plows basically met the prescribed standards. At present, the factories have begun to produce double-wheeled double-shared plows in large quantities. The Hefei Mining Machinery Factory plans to manufacture 2,000 units before the end of February. The double-wheeled double-shared plows manufactured in the province this year will also be supplied to farmers in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces.

    安徽开始制造各种新式农具
    安徽省地方国营机械农具工厂今年计划为农民制造许多新式农具。其中有双轮双铧?两万七千部，双轮单铧?一千部，圆盘耙一千一百二十六部，山芋切片机三千多部，水车四千多部，锄草机七十台，还有弹花机和轧花机等。
    今年的双轮双铧?是按照中央统一标定的图纸制造的，材料结构加强了，?上的零件还能够达到互换使用。各厂为了能够在第一季度制造出一批双轮双铧?，供应农民春耕生产，去年年底便结束了样品试制工作，经各部门进行鉴定后，认为试制的双轮双铧?的规格质量，基本上达到了规定标准。目前各厂已开始大批地生产双轮双铧?，合肥矿山机器厂计划在二月底前制造出两千部。省内今年制造的双轮双铧?还将供应湖北、江西两省的农民使用。
