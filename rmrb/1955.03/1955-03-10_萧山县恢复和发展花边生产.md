Xiaoshan County in Zhejiang Province produces lace that sold well abroad before the Anti-Japanese War, with a maximum annual output of six million yards. Later, affected by the war and soaring prices, lace production came to a standstill. After liberation, the People's Government supported the restoration of production and assisted in opening up sales channels, so that lace production gradually recovered.

In January and February of this year, the Industry Department of the Xiaoshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the County Women's Federation, and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative jointly held two women's representative meetings to study the restoration and development of lace production. The meeting decided that, with mutual assistance and cooperation as the center, and on the premise of doing a good job in agricultural production, efforts should be made to produce six million yards of lace.

After the meeting, lace production cooperatives were established in various places. In Nanyang Township alone, more than 1,500 people have joined the lace production cooperative. An old woman of seventy-six specially bought glasses, preparing to resume embroidery and pass on her skills to the younger generation. Xiao Fengxian, a woman from Yipeng District, and others, realizing that arranging lace production and other sideline production would not affect agricultural production, are actively mobilizing and organizing other women to participate in lace production.

    萧山县恢复和发展花边生产
    浙江省萧山县出产的花边，抗战以前曾经畅销国外，最高年产量达六百万码。后来，受战争和物价猛涨等的影响，花边生产陷于停顿。解放以后，人民政府一面扶持恢复生产，一面协助打开销路，花边生产才又逐渐恢复起来。
    今年一、二月间，中共萧山县委手工业部、县妇女联合会、县供销合作社等单位，共同召开了二次妇女代表会议，研究恢复和发展花边生产。会上讨论决定，要以互助合作为中心，在搞好农业生产的前提下，争取生产六百万码花边。
    会后，各地纷纷成立花边生产合作社，仅南阳乡就已经有一千五百多人加入花边生产合作社。一位七十六岁的老婆婆，特地买了眼镜，准备恢复挑花和把手艺传授给年青的一代。义蓬区妇女萧凤仙等认识到把花边生产和其他副业生产安排好，不会影响农业生产以后，正积极动员和组织其他妇女参加花边生产。
