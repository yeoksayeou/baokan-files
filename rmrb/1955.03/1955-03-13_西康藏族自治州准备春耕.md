The land in various counties of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Xikang Province has gradually thawed, and preparations for spring plowing have begun. In order to further improve farming techniques in the autonomous prefecture and increase agricultural production, more than 1,900 pieces of new-style animal-powered farm implements, such as walking plows, seeders, and spike-tooth harrows, have been transported to various counties. In Daofu County alone, 170 pieces of various new-style farm implements will be put into spring plowing production. The area sown with improved wheat varieties will also be expanded compared to 1954, and Kangding, Yajiang and other counties have prepared more than 50,000 jin of improved varieties. At the same time, the thousands of mu of land newly reclaimed by landless and land-poor Tibetan people in 1954 will be sown for the first time in spring plowing. To ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing, many counties have successively held enlarged cadre meetings to arrange spring plowing work. Agricultural technical guidance personnel or spring plowing work groups in some counties have also gone down to districts and townships. (Our Ya'an Reporter)

    西康藏族自治州准备春耕
    西康省藏族自治州各县土地已陆续解冻，春耕准备工作已经展开。为着进一步改良自治州的耕作技术，提高农业生产，一千九百多件步犁、播种机、钉齿耙等各种新式畜力农具已运到各县。仅道孚县即将有一百七十多件各种新式农具投入春耕生产。小麦良种播种面积也将比一九五四年扩大，康定、雅江等县亦已准备了良种五万余斤。同时，无地缺地的藏民在一九五四年新开垦的数千亩地，也将在春耕中第一次播下种籽。为保证春耕的顺利进行，许多县已先后召开了扩大干部会议，布置春耕工作。有些县的农业技术指导工作人员或领导春耕的工作组也下到了区、乡。  （本报雅安记者）
