Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 18th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 18th that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party held an enlarged meeting last week.

    The Central Committee analyzed the international and domestic situation, reviewed the implementation of tasks since the armistice day, and stipulated the tasks for the Party and the people in 1955.

    The communique issued by the Central Committee pointed out that after the Geneva Conference, due to the war-provoking policies implemented by the U.S. imperialists, the international situation has become tense again, and world peace is facing serious threats. However, the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are stronger and more united than in the past, and possess enormous potential in safeguarding peace.

    Regarding the domestic situation, the communique pointed out that the U.S. imperialists have been interfering in Indochina more and more directly. They are colluding with the French colonialist group that is undermining the armistice agreement, and are instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem group to sabotage the implementation of the armistice agreement and undermine peace and national unification.

    The communique pointed out that the specific enemies of the Vietnamese people at present are the U.S. imperialists, the French colonialist group that is undermining the armistice agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem group; the U.S. imperialists are the primary and most dangerous enemy.

    Based on the above views, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party stipulated five major tasks for the entire Party and the people, the primary task of which is to continue to struggle for the correct implementation of the armistice agreement, the consolidation of peace, and the realization of national unification.

    越南劳动党中央委员会举行扩大会议
    规定全党和人民的五项主要任务
    【新华社河内十八日电】　据越南通讯社十八日讯：越南劳动党中央委员会在上星期举行了扩大会议。
    中央委员会分析了国际和国内局势，审查了从停战日以来执行任务的情况，并且规定了党和人民在一九五五年的任务。
    中央委员会发表的公报指出：日内瓦会议以后，由于美帝国主义者实行的战争挑衅政策，国际局势又紧张起来，世界和平正受到严重威胁。然而，和平、民主和社会主义的力量已经比过去更加强大、更加团结，并且在维护和平上拥有巨大的潜力。
    关于国内局势，公报指出：美帝国主义者一直在越来越直接地干涉印度支那。他们正在同破坏停战协定的法国殖民主义分子集团狼狈为奸，并且正在煽动吴庭艳集团破坏停战协定的履行，破坏和平和国家的统一。
    公报指出，越南人民当前的具体敌人就是美帝国主义者、破坏停战协定的法国殖民主义分子集团和吴庭艳集团；美帝国主义者是首要的、最危险的敌人。
    根据上述观点，越南劳动党中央委员会为全党和人民规定了五项主要任务，其中首要的任务就是继续为正确履行停战协定、巩固和平、和实现全国统一而斗争。
