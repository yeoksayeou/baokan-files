Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 17th: According to Hong Kong newspapers, Egyptian jurists Adel Amin and Mahmoud Atallah, who attended the Asian Lawyers' Conference, have left Hong Kong on the 13th to return to their country after being invited to visit China.

Amin told reporters in Hong Kong: "The common aspiration of the Chinese people is to defend world peace. The Chinese people believe that peace cannot be guaranteed without liberating Taiwan. They are right; peace cannot be consolidated while imperialists still occupy and use this place to carry out threats." He said: "The Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan is very firm. They are not afraid of any intimidation and will not be deterred by threats of atomic weapons."

Amin said that the eleven American pilots imprisoned in China were guilty of espionage and had received a fair trial. He said: "If these eleven pilots engaged in the same activities in our country, Egypt would also convict them."

Amin also said: "After visiting New China ourselves, we are even more convinced that the Egyptian government needs to establish normal diplomatic relations with New China as soon as possible, which is also in Egypt's own interests."

Regarding the upcoming Asian-African Conference, Amin said, "This is another step towards unity and cooperation among the people of Asia and Africa." He said that the attendance of representatives from the People's Republic of China at this conference is of great significance.

    埃及法学家阿明在香港谈访问我国的观感
    【新华社广州十七日电】据香港报纸报道，出席亚洲法律工作者会议的埃及法学家阿德尔·阿明和马茂德·阿特拉两人，在应邀访问中国以后，已经在十三日离香港回国。
    阿明在香港时曾经对记者发表谈话说：“中国人民的共同意愿是保卫世界和平，中国人民认为如果不解放台湾，和平就难获保证。他们是对的，当帝国主义者还占据和利用这块地方来进行威胁时，和平是无法巩固的。”他说：“中国人民解放台湾的意志很坚决，他们决不怕任何威吓，也不会被原子武器的恫吓所阻止。”
    阿明说，被囚禁在中国的十一名美国飞行员都犯有间谍罪行，他们受到了公正的审讯。他说：“如果这十一个飞行员对我们国家进行同样活动的话，埃及也是会判他们罪的。”
    阿明又说：“我们亲自访问了新中国之后，更加认为埃及政府有迅速同新中国建立正常外交关系的必要，这也是为了埃及本身的利益”。
    阿明在谈到即将举行的亚非会议时说，“这是亚洲和非洲人民走向团结合作的又一步”。他说，中华人民共和国的代表出席这个会议是有重要意义的。
