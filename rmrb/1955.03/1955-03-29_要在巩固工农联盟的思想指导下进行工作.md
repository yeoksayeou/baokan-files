What role do new-style animal-powered farm implements play in improving agricultural production? According to materials from several counties in Liaoning Province, new farm implements can increase production by an average of 20 to 30 percent compared to old farm implements. The Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changtu County, using new farm implements to cultivate soybeans, increased soybean yields by 34 percent compared to using old farm implements; sorghum yields increased by 86.4 percent. Farmers praised the crops cultivated with new farm implements, saying, "Crops cultivated with new-style farm implements on the same land are truly a notch above, a head taller than those cultivated with old farm implements." From this, we can more clearly recognize that, in order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, the working class should use sturdy, practical, and economical products created by their labor to support our farmer brothers, and improve agricultural productivity. Every new-style farm implement put into production means strengthening the forces of agricultural collectivization, producing more grain, thereby more closely consolidating the unity of workers and peasants, and accelerating the cause of socialist construction. However, some factories responsible for manufacturing new-style farm implements have not recognized this point, and in producing new farm implements, they simply pursue output, resulting in the production of a large number of substandard new-style farm implements and a large number of rejects. The Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory is one such factory. Before February, the farm implements they delivered to the state were not sturdy and practical products, but a large number of rejects. The plowshare alone had 50,000 rejects. The farm implement parts they sent to various places were not sturdy, affecting the installation work of the farm implement factories. These parts not only failed to reach the countryside in a timely manner according to the production season requirements, but were piled up in large quantities in the factory courtyard, and subscribers wrote letters to question them. The situation began to turn around in March, but it has already affected spring plowing in some areas and caused dissatisfaction among our farmer brothers.

Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that the leading cadres of this factory did not regard the manufacture of new farm implements as a major political task; they did not combine the production of new-style farm implements with the task of implementing the Party's general line. Therefore, in practical work, they ignored the practical significance of manufacturing new-style farm implements for the socialist transformation of agriculture; they did not consider that sending some farm implements that could not withstand use or farm implement parts that were not interchangeable to the farmers would waste the farmers' production funds and affect their expanded reproduction. Therefore, they treated this major task with an indifferent attitude, even thinking: "Making farm implements and plow bottoms (i.e., plowshares) is nothing." They did not humbly learn from the experience of other factories. The leading cadres responsible for administrative technology did not study the technical standards of the new product plowshare and other relevant product technical materials, nor did they organize employees to study. The factory has been producing plowshares for two months, and the workers and technicians directly engaged in production have not yet seen the drawings of the new product. Of the twenty people who inspected product quality, only five could preliminarily read the drawings, and some metal models had errors that were not detected. After rejects were produced, the administrative leading cadres did not take emergency measures to investigate responsibility and strengthen technical supervision. Instead, they asked the technical inspection personnel to relax the inspection and allow a large number of unqualified products to leave the factory.

The Party organization of the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory is responsible for its failure to produce new farm implements under the guidance of the idea of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Although the Party organization mobilized the workers when producing new farm implements and talked about the principles of the worker-peasant alliance, they only talked about the principles in general. Comrade Pan Jiu, the general branch secretary, said: We have talked about the principles and considered these two issues: first, to support farmers' production and accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture; second, the factory does not have many production tasks, and we want to use it to complete more tasks and improve our technical level at the same time. These ideas are good, but the Party organization did not use concrete work to adhere to these principles. Therefore, the part about supporting farmers became a general slogan. This is a lesson. Party workers cannot be satisfied with general calls, and must also do a lot of specific work to transform general calls into practical actions of the masses. This requires the Party organization to pay attention to various ideological problems of people in the production process and resolve them in a timely manner; this requires the Party organization to raise every specific problem raised in the production process to political principles, encourage the enthusiasm of the masses, and organize the strength of the masses to solve them. The biggest problem encountered by the factory in producing new-style farm implement parts is that the tolerance does not meet national requirements. However, the Party organization, like the administrative staff, simply regarded the tolerance problem as a technical problem. The fact is not entirely so. The tolerance problem is a technical problem, but it is also a political problem: first, if the tolerance problem is not solved, rejects will be produced, causing losses to the state; second, if the tolerance of product parts does not meet the regulations, it will affect the assembly work of the assembly factory, they will have to reprocess it, wasting man-hours and delaying the time of farm implement delivery; third, it is easy for farmers to break products that do not meet specifications. The most important thing is that they cannot be used universally, which increases the economic burden on farmers and may cause farmers' dissatisfaction, which is not conducive to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. If the Party organization can clearly understand the tolerance problem from these three aspects, then they will not take a laissez-faire attitude towards the technical work in this production, and will treat the tolerance problem as a political problem, and raise it to the general branch committee, the party member conference, and the worker masses conference, mobilizing everyone to solve this problem. The Party organization will also strictly supervise the technical leadership of the administrative department and promptly correct various careless thoughts. In this case, the tolerance problem may be solved. The factory Party organization began to accept this lesson in March, and the situation has changed initially. This is the best proof.

The workers of the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory were very enthusiastic in manufacturing farm implements this time. This caused the Party organization to have a misconception, thinking that "the workers are in high spirits and the completion of production is guaranteed," thus ignoring the other side, that is, in order to keep the workers' production enthusiasm rising and become the material force to ensure the production of excellent products, the Party organization's political work must keep up, walk in front of the workers, mobilize people to use their brains, tap potential, overcome difficulties, and solve key problems in production. The Heating Equipment Factory Party organization did not do this this time. As a comrade from the general branch said: "It was a vigorous start, but became at a loss as soon as problems arose," which inevitably poured cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses. The Party organization should never be satisfied with the enthusiasm of the masses, but after the masses are mobilized, it should deeply discover and study the specific problems in people's thoughts and production, and solve them in a timely manner to consolidate the enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, it is necessary to be good at organizing the strength of the masses to overcome the difficulties in production and carry out labor competitions.

The Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory has now inspected this problem, and the production of new farm implements has been improved. However, all factories that directly or indirectly serve rural production should learn from this lesson. The Party organization should constantly conduct education on the leading role of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance in production, so that the workers and masses can recognize the political significance of each product produced for the countryside, strictly check product quality, oppose all ideas that lower standards and are careless, and ensure that truly high-quality, durable, and inexpensive products are produced for our farmer brothers.

    要在巩固工农联盟的思想指导下进行工作
    安岗
    新式畜力农具对提高农业生产起些什么作用呢？根据辽宁省几个县的材料，新农具比旧农具平均能提高生产百分之二十到三十左右。昌图县胜利农业生产合作社，使用新农具耕种的大豆，比用旧农具耕种的大豆产量提高百分之三十四；高粱产量提高百分之八十六点四。农民称赞用新农具耕种的庄稼说：“同样的土地新式农具比旧农具耕种的庄稼，真是差一道，高一头。”从这里我们可以更清楚地认识到，为了巩固工农联盟，工人阶级应该用自己劳动创造出来的坚固、适用、经济的产品来支援农民弟兄，提高农业生产力。每一个新式农具投入生产，都意味着增强农业集体化的力量，多打粮食，从而更亲密地巩固工农的团结，加速社会主义建设事业。可是，有些担负新式农具制造任务的工厂却没有认识到这一点，而在生产新农具时，单纯追求产量，以致生产了大量不合规格的新式农具和大量废品。沈阳暖气器材厂就是这样的一个工厂。他们承担制造的一部分农具，在二月以前交给国家的不是坚固适用的产品而是大量的废品。仅犁镜一项就出了五万片废品。他们发到各地的农具零件不坚固，影响了农具工厂的安装工作。这些零件不但没有能按照生产季节要求及时送到农村，反而大批堆积在工厂院内，订户纷纷来信质问。三月份情况开始扭转，但已影响了部分地区的春耕，引起了农民弟兄的不满。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？主要是这个工厂的领导干部没有把制造新农具当做一个重大的政治任务；没有把新式农具的生产同贯彻执行党的总路线的任务结合起来，因而在实际工作中忽视了制造新式农具对农业社会主义改造的实际意义；没有考虑到把一些经不起使唤的农具或是不能通用互换的农具零件送到农民手里，这就要浪费农民的生产资金，影响他们扩大再生产。因而他们用满不在乎的情绪来对待这个重大任务，甚至认为：“搞农具、犁碗子（即犁镜）没有个啥。”他们不去虚心学习别的工厂的经验，负责行政技术工作的领导干部不学习新产品犁镜的技术标准和其他有关产品的技术材料，也没有组织职工去学习。工厂生产犁镜已有两个月了，直接从事生产的工人和技术员，还没有看到新产品的图纸。二十名检查产品质量的人员只有五个人能初步看图纸，有的金属模型有错误，也没有被检查出来。出了废品后，行政领导干部没有采取紧急措施，追究责任并加强技术监督，反而要技术检查人员放松检查，允许大量不合格的产品出厂。
    沈阳暖气器材厂不能在巩固工农联盟的思想指导下来生产新农具，工厂党组织是要负责的。党组织在生产新农具时，虽然向工人作了动员，讲了工农联盟的道理。但是，他们却只是一般地讲讲道理。总支书记潘九同志说：我们道理是讲了，也考虑到这样两个问题：一是支援农民生产，加快对农业的社会主义改造；二是工厂生产任务不多，想拿它来多完成些任务，同时提高我们的技术水平。这些想法都是好的，但是，党组织没有用具体工作来坚持这些原则，因而，关于支援农民的一部分就成了一般的口号。这是一个教训。党的工作者不能只满足于一般的号召，还要作许多具体工作才能把一般号召变成为群众的实际行动。这就要党组织注意人们在生产过程中的各种思想问题，及时给以解决；这就要党组织把生产过程中所提出的每一个具体问题，都提到政治原则上去，鼓舞群众的积极性并组织群众的力量来解决。工厂在生产新式农具部件中所碰到的最大的问题是：公差达不到国家要求。党组织却和行政人员一样把公差问题单纯看作是技术问题。事实不完全是这样。公差问题是一个技术问题，但也是一个政治问题：第一，公差问题不解决，就会产生废品，给国家带来损失；第二，产品部件公差不符合规定就要影响装配工厂的装配工作，他们就要重新加工，浪费工时，拖延农具出厂时间；第三，农民拿到公差不合规定的产品，很容易坏，最重要的是不能通用互换，增加农民经济负担，也会引起农民的不满，有碍工农联盟的巩固。如果党组织能够清醒地从这三个方面去认识公差问题，那么，他们对这次生产中的技术工作就不会采取自流态度，就会把公差问题当作一个政治问题，同时提到总支委员会、党员大会和职工群众大会上，动员大家来解决这个问题。党组织也就会严格监督行政部门的技术领导工作，及时纠正各种疏忽大意的思想。在这种情况下，公差问题就可能得到解决。三月份工厂党组织开始接受了这一教训，情况就初步有了改变，这是一个最好的证明。
    沈阳暖气器材厂工人们在这次制造农具时热情是十分高的，这就使党组织发生了一个错觉，以为“工人情绪很高，完成生产有保证”，从而忽视了另外一面，这就是，要使工人的生产情绪不断高涨并成为保证生产优良产品的物质力量，党组织的政治工作就必须跟上来，走在工人前面，动员人们动脑力，挖潜力，克服困难，解决生产中的关键问题。暖气器材厂党组织这次没有这样作，结果就像总支一位同志说的：“开始时轰轰烈烈，一出问题变成手足失措”，这样也就必然给群众的热情泼了冷水。党组织永远不要满足于群众的热情，要在群众发动起来后，深入地发现、研究人们思想中和生产中的具体问题，及时地给予解决，以巩固群众的热情。同时，要善于组织群众的力量去克服生产中的困难，开展劳动竞赛。
    沈阳暖气器材厂现在已经对这个问题进行了检查，新农具的生产情况已经有所改进。但是，一切直接或间接为农村生产服务的工厂都应该从这里吸取教训，党组织应当在生产中经常不断地进行工人阶级领导作用和工农联盟的教育，使职工群众认识为农村生产的每一个产品的政治意义，要严格检查产品质量，反对一切降低标准马虎大意的思想，要保证给农民兄弟生产真正优良耐用，物美价廉的产品。
