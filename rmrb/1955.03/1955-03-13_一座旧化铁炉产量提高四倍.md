	Old Cupola Furnace Output Quadrupled

	The Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has a cupola furnace that, before liberation, could only smelt ten tons of iron at a time. Now, the smelting capacity per cycle has increased to fifty-four tons. This is the result of the hard work and research of the cupola furnace team workers.
	This cupola furnace was originally a two-ton furnace, capable of melting two tons of molten iron per hour. Before liberation, this furnace was very old, and it had to be shut down or repaired every four or five hours of operation. It was only fired every other day, with a maximum smelting capacity of only ten tons. After liberation, the cupola furnace team workers suggested enlarging the furnace shell and converting it into a three-ton cupola furnace, firing it every day, smelting about twelve to fourteen tons of iron. In 1953, this furnace could run for seven to eight hours each time, melting twenty-one to twenty-four tons of iron daily, with a maximum of twenty-six tons. Some people thought that this furnace could not be improved any further. In 1954, the workers of the cupola furnace team researched and developed two methods to extend the continuous furnace operation time: one was to use quartz sand mixture instead of firebricks to repair the furnace, and the other was to enlarge the furnace shell by fifty millimeters in the melting zone, where the temperature is highest, in order to thicken the furnace wall. As a result of adopting these two methods, it could be continuously operated for about seventeen hours, and the smelting capacity also increased to about fifty tons per day, and at the highest, it had continuously operated for eighteen hours, smelting fifty-four tons of iron.
	In recent years, the workers of the cupola furnace team have brought their collective wisdom into play, increasing the smelting capacity of the old cupola furnace, whose equipment and size have not changed, by more than four times. This team has now won the glorious title of factory-level advanced team. (Our Nanjing reporter)

    一座旧化铁炉产量提高四倍
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂有一座解放前每次只能熔炼十吨铁的化铁炉，现在每次熔炼量已提高到五十四吨。这是化铁炉小组的工人们苦心钻研的成果。
    这座化铁炉，原是每小时炼二吨铁水的二吨炉。解放前，这座炉子已很陈旧，每次运转四、五小时就要停炉或检修，隔一天开一次炉，熔炼量最高不过十吨。解放后，化铁炉小组工人建议将炉壳放大，改装为三吨化铁炉，每天开炉，化铁达十二吨至十四吨左右。一九五三年，这座炉子每次可运行七至八小时，每天化铁达二十一至二十四吨，最高到二十六吨。有些人认为，这座炉子再也没法改进了。化铁炉小组的工人在一九五四年又研究出延长连续开炉时间的两个办法：一个是用石英砂混合料代替火砖修炉，一个是将温度最高的熔化带部分炉壳放大五十公厘，以加厚炉壁。采用这两个办法的结果，可连续开炉十七小时左右，熔炼量也随着提高到每天五十吨左右，最高时曾连续开炉十八小时，化铁五十四吨。
    几年来，化铁炉小组的工人们发挥了集体智慧，使装置、大小都没有变动的旧化铁炉的熔炼量提高了四倍多。这个小组现在已经获得厂级先进小组的光荣称号。           （本报南京记者）
