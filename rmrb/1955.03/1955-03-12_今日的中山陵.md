Today's Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum
	Xie Zuyin Gao Yu

Spring has arrived, and the tree-lined avenue outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing is becoming increasingly crowded. People are coming in groups, filled with reverence for Mr. Sun Yat-sen, to the magnificent and scenic Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

To ensure that millions of people forever commemorate this great democratic revolutionary activist of modern China, the Communist Party and the People's Government have repeatedly renovated the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum over the past five years. On the very day that the People's Liberation Army crossed the river and liberated Nanjing, the PLA troops entering the city dispatched representatives to join the remaining management personnel in protecting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's tomb. In recent years, the uneven tomb passage has been repaired and leveled, the partially collapsed platforms have been restored, the stone top of the mausoleum has been repaired, and the stone walls of the small houses in the four corners of the memorial hall have been painted apple green. Famous historical sites such as the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Xingjian Pavilion, and Meihua Mountain Cloister have all been renovated. Erdaogou, located more than a hundred meters southeast of Sun Yat-sen's tomb, is a place of exceptional scenic beauty. Before liberation, the water-retaining dam had many loopholes in its base due to years of disrepair. At that time, the bureaucratic Kuomintang reactionaries, under the pretext of repairing the Erdaogou dam, engaged in corruption and embezzlement, leading to the collapse of the dam, the drying up of the water, and the dilapidation of the waterside pavilion, causing the scenery to deteriorate. However, the bandit Chiang built a grand villa in the mausoleum park for his own enjoyment. Today, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum has returned to the hands of the people, and the face of Erdaogou has also changed. In 1953, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government repaired the dam, and in 1954, it renovated the waterside pavilion, covering it with newly made beige cement tiles, and painting the pillars and railings with yellow and dark green paint. This has become the best resting place for visitors and tourists.

Since liberation, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government has established the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Administration Office to protect and manage the mausoleum. We visited Fan Liang, who guards the mausoleum, and is now over fifty years old. He told us that since Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away and Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, the lives of the guards became more difficult day by day. Before liberation, he was constantly worried about his livelihood. Only after liberation did his life improve. Now he serves as the head of the guarding team at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The experiences of the past few years have made him younger, and he is working hard to learn new things. Six of his children are either applying to join the Communist Youth League or are already Young Pioneers. Even his wife has become a sanitation representative for the residents. After thirty years of personal experience, he feels that it is the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people who truly respect Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

The horticultural workers, who are familiar with every plant and tree in the mausoleum, are diligently cultivating every tree and plant. To make the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum even more beautiful, they have contributed all their skills, making the various flowers and trees grow more exquisitely and become more lovely.

The farmers living near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, under the leadership of the Nanjing Mausoleum District People's Government, have organized a forest protection committee. Every family's patriotic pledge includes: protecting the trees in the mausoleum and not violating the mausoleum rules. During festivals or in the dead of winter, the forest protection team patrols day and night. In recent years, there have been no more forest fires.

Over the past five years, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum has become a place that the working people will never forget. Every day, especially on holidays and festivals, from dawn to dusk, rows of people often line up on the platform in front of the memorial hall to pay their respects. In the memorial hall, we randomly opened a book of mausoleum records. On the page for February 27th of this year, it was recorded: "Today's visitors: 4,990 workers and office staff; 1,946 soldiers; 720 farmers; 1,840 students;..." The management also told us that the number of visitors is increasing year by year: it was over 300,000 in 1950, and reached over 1 million in 1954. While we were talking, among the rows of people passing by us, there were industrial workers from Shanghai and other places, kiln workers from the suburbs of Nanjing, and residents of various ages and wearing different clothes, many of whom were mothers and young women with children.

Leaders of the Communist Party and the People's Government have come to pay their respects. After visiting the mausoleum, they always instruct the mausoleum staff to take good care of Sun Yat-sen's tomb. General Liu Bocheng also sent thirty catties of Yunnan pine seeds, which have now been sown in the nursery, and the seedlings have grown to three or four inches high.

International friends from more than thirty countries have also come to pay their respects. They come from Europe, Southeast Asia, the Americas, and Australia, from all corners of the world. Among them are government delegations, as well as cultural and artistic workers and peace fighters. Last year, the Soviet government delegation, led by Khrushchev, China's closest friend, came to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to lay wreaths. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu have also visited here. Writers and poets have also used their beautiful poems to praise this great patriot.

In the near future, with the development of national construction, the people of New China will use their labor to build a cultural and scenic area centered around Sun Yat-sen's tomb, to forever commemorate this great revolutionary activist. (Attached picture)

    今日的中山陵
    谢祖荫　高羽
    春天，南京中山门外的林荫大道上，行人愈来愈多了。人们成群结队地怀着对孙中山先生的崇敬的心情，来到气魄雄伟、景色动人的中山陵。
    为了让千百万人民永远纪念着这位近代中国的伟大民主主义革命活动家，五年多来，共产党和人民政府历次地修缮着中山陵。在解放军渡江解放南京的第一天，入城的解放军部队就派出了代表，会同留守的管理人员保护着孙中山先生的陵墓。这几年来，坑洼不平的陵墓甬道被修补平坦了，部分坍塌的平台也恢复了，灵寝石顶修补了，灵堂四角的小屋的石壁也漆成了苹果绿色。明孝陵、行健亭、梅花山回廊等名胜古迹都已经过修缮。在中山陵墓东南一百多公尺的二道沟，是一个风景绝佳的地方。解放前，拦水的堤坝因为年久失修，堤底漏洞很多，当时，国民党反动派的官僚们借口修理二道沟水坝，徇私舞弊，贪污中饱，以致堤坝坍塌，水干了，水榭也残破了，景物日益凋零。可是，蒋贼却在陵园里筑起了高大的别墅，尽情享乐。今天，中山陵已回到人民的手中了，二道沟的面貌也随着改观了。一九五三年，南京市人民政府修复了水坝，一九五四年又整修了水榭，盖上新制的米色水泥瓦片，柱子栏杆涂上了黄色和深绿色的油漆。这里成了谒陵者和游人最好的憩息场所。
    解放以后，南京市人民政府在陵园设立了中山陵园管理处，看护和管理陵园。我们曾经访问过拱卫陵墓的范良，他今年已经五十多岁了。他告诉我们，自从孙中山先生逝世蒋介石叛变了革命以后，他们拱卫人员的日子是一天比一天难过。在解放前，他就天天愁着自己的生活。只在解放以后，生活才获得改善。现在他担任中山陵的拱卫组长。这几年来的生活使他变得年青了，他努力学习新的东西。他的六个孩子，有的在要求参加青年团，有的已是少先队员。就连他的妻子，也做了居民的卫生代表。三十年来的亲身体验，他感到真正尊敬孙中山先生的是共产党、人民政府和人民。
    熟悉陵园一花一木的园艺工人们，辛勤地培植着陵园的每一棵林木。他们为了使中山陵更加美丽，贡献出了自己所有的手艺，使得各色各样的花木越长越精巧，越来越可爱了。
    住在中山陵附近的农民，已经在南京陵园区人民政府领导下，组织了护林委员会，每一家的爱国公约上都订着：保护陵园树木，不违反陵园规则。每当节日或腊月隆冬，护林小组日夜都在巡逻。近几年来，再没有发生过山火。
    五年来，中山陵已成为劳动人民念念不忘的地方，每天，特别是假日和节日，从清晨到黄昏，灵堂前的平台上，常常一行行地排着前往谒陵的人们。在灵堂里，我们随手打开了一本陵园纪事册，在今年二月二十七日的一页上，纪载着：“今天来谒陵的人：工人和机关工作人员四千九百九十人；部队一千九百四十六人；农民七百二十人；学生一千八百四十人；……”管理人员还告诉我们，谒陵的人逐年增加：一九五○年是三十多万，一九五四年就达一百多万人了。在我们谈话时，从我们身旁走过的行列中，就有从上海等地来的产业工人，从南京郊区来的烧窑工人，还有穿着各种不同服装，不同年纪的居民，其中，很多是带着孩子的母亲和青年妇女。
    到此地来谒陵的，有共产党和人民政府的领导人员。他们在谒陵后，总是嘱咐陵园员工们要好好地保护孙中山的陵墓。刘伯承将军还特地派人送来了三十斤云南松种子，现在这批种子已撒下苗圃，幼苗长得有三、四寸高了。
    到此地来谒陵的，还有三十多个国家的国际友人。他们从欧洲，从东南亚，从美洲和澳大利亚，从世界的四面八方来到这里。其中有政府代表团，也有文化艺术工作者和和平战士们。去年，中国人民最亲密的朋友、以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联政府代表团，到中山陵灵堂来献了花圈。印度总理尼赫鲁、缅甸总理吴努也来过这里。作家们、诗人们也以他们美丽的诗篇，歌颂了这位伟大的爱国主义者。
    在不久的将来，随着国家建设的发展，新中国的人民，将以自己的劳动，在这里建筑起一个以中山陵墓为中心的文化区和名胜区，永远来纪念这位伟大的革命活动家。（附图片）
