Liaoning Distillery Uses Substitutes to Brew Liquor

To save national grain and solve the problem of insufficient raw materials for shochu, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry and the Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau conducted pilot work on using substitutes for brewing liquor at the Xinmin County Distillery. Eight substitutes have been successfully tested, including acorns, red dates, sweet potatoes, cornstarch residue, apples, white pears, An pears, and hawthorns. Among them, acorns and red dates have the highest alcohol yield, with an average yield of over 30%. Acorns, An pears, apples, sweet potatoes, and cornstarch residue have produced raw liquor with an alcohol content of over 60 proof. The alcohol yield and alcohol content of these substitutes have reached the standard for brewing liquor with grain. Using these substitutes to brew liquor can not only save a large amount of grain for the country and meet the needs of the people's lives, but also supply alcohol needed for industrial production and the medical sector. For example, using acorns to brew liquor has an alcohol yield of 31.4%, and the alcohol content reaches over 96 proof, which can completely replace alcohol for industrial use. Its cost is only about 0.21 yuan per jin, which is more than three-quarters cheaper than the market price of alcohol. In the first quarter of this year, 21 distilleries in the province have used various substitutes for brewing liquor.

    辽宁制酒厂利用代用品酿酒
    为了节约国家粮食和解决烧酒原料不足问题，辽宁省工业厅和烟酒专卖局，在新民县制酒厂进行了利用代用品酿酒的试点工作，已试验成功的有橡子、红枣、地瓜、苞米淀粉渣子、苹果、白梨、安梨、山楂等八种代用品。其中以橡子、红枣出酒率为最高，出酒率平均都达到百分之三十以上，原酒度数达到六十度以上的有橡子、安梨、苹果、地瓜、苞米淀粉渣子等五种，这些代用品的出酒率和原酒度数都达到了用粮食酿酒的标准。利用这些代用品酿酒，不仅能为国家节约大批粮食，满足人民生活上的需要，而且可以供应工业生产和医药部门所需用的酒精。如利用橡子酿酒，出酒率为百分之三十一点四，原酒度数达到九十六度以上，完全可以代替酒精使用。而它的成本每市斤仅二角一分左右，比市场的酒精卖价便宜四分之三以上。在今年第一季度内，全省已有二十一个制酒厂利用各种代用品进行酿酒。
