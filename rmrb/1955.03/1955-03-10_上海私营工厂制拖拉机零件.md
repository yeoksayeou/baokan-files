Shanghai private factories are manufacturing 160,000 tractor and farm implement parts for state-owned farms and tractor stations across the country, supporting agricultural production.

These tractor parts are all manufactured according to Soviet specifications. Despite the relatively poor equipment conditions in private factories, workers have shown a high degree of initiative and overcome many difficulties. For example, after receiving an order, Minyi Private Machinery Factory formed a work group to modify tools and molds, and at the same time, helped foundries improve technology and reduce defective castings. When workers at the Dongxingchang Private Machinery Factory were making the "flower pad shims" for five-bottom plows, they didn't have milling machines. Veteran worker Qian Helin used his ingenuity to modify a set of tools and used a lathe instead.

Currently, the first batch of processing orders has been delivered ahead of schedule by 17 factories including Jiuchang, Minyi, and Baile private factories. More than 30,000 parts urgently needed for spring plowing this year, such as five-bottom plows, three-bottom plows, and seeders, have been completed and sent to the Northeast State Farm Supply Station in Harbin and the Shuangqiao Supply Station in Beijing, among other units.

    上海私营工厂制拖拉机零件
    上海市一百多家私营机器厂，正为各地国营农场和拖拉机站制造十六万件拖拉机农具零件，支援农业生产。
    这批拖拉机零件，全部按照苏联规格制造，在私营厂设备条件较差的情况下，工人们发挥了高度的积极性，克服了许多困难，如私营民一机器厂接到订货后，成立工作组，改工具、改模子，同时，帮助翻砂厂提高技术减少翻砂退工。私营东兴昌机器厂工人在做五铧犁上的零件“花垫稍子”时，没有铣床，老工人钱和林开动脑筋改了一副工具，利用车床代替。
    现在，第一批加工订货任务已有私营久昌、民一、百乐等十七个厂提前交货。今年春耕期间所急需的五铧犁、三铧犁和播种机等的零件，已完成三万多件，并已送往哈尔滨的东北国营农场供应站和北京双桥供应站等单位。
