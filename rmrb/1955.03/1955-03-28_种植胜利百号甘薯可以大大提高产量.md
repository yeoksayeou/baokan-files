Planting the Victory No. 100 Sweet Potato Can Greatly Increase Yield
	Sun Shuhan

	Victory No. 100 is an excellent sweet potato variety. Its main advantage is its high yield. Over the past few years, whether in farm trials or farmer cultivation, its yield has been more than 50% higher than local varieties. According to trial plantings in farms in Shandong, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces, Victory No. 100 increased production by an average of 74% compared to local varieties, with some increasing production by 150%. In Xinye County, Henan Province, local sweet potato varieties yielded an average of 1,000 to 2,000 jin per mu, while Victory No. 100 could yield 2,000 to 4,000 jin, with some high-yielding plots reaching 10,000 jin per mu.

	The Victory No. 100 sweet potato has strong adaptability to natural environments and is suitable for planting from south to north, in both mountainous and plain areas. It is relatively drought-resistant, has a short growth period, forms tubers early, and has a high and stable yield. Summer-planted sweet potatoes are generally transplanted after harvesting wheat during the "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear) season and can be harvested when frost arrives. When using sweet potatoes as a late-autumn replanting crop in the event of summer and autumn disasters, the advantages of the Victory No. 100 sweet potato become even more prominent. In 1953, Anhui Province experienced a drought in the autumn. In September, ordinary sweet potatoes were only as thick as fingers, while Victory No. 100 was already the size of eggs. The farmers happily said, "Little Red Cap (the local farmers' nickname for the Victory No. 100 sweet potato) is really good." In 1954, the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaobian Village, Bulun Township, Sixian County, Anhui, replanted Victory No. 100 after a flood and harvested an average of 700 jin per mu. At the same time, local sweet potato varieties replanted yielded a total of only 700 jin from five mu. According to experiments conducted by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute in 1954, Victory No. 100, transplanted as late as August 20th, yielded 850 jin per mu after only 76 days of growth.

	Another advantage is that its vines are short and thick, some are upright, and the nodes rarely take root or form small tubers, saving a lot of vine-turning labor compared to ordinary long-vine varieties. At the same time, because its vines are short and the tubers are concentrated, the plants occupy a smaller area, which can appropriately increase the number of plants per mu and increase yield.

	The only disadvantage of Victory No. 100 is its relatively poor quality and low sugar content.

	In recent years, due to the government's promotion and the public's welcome, the planting area of Victory No. 100 has gradually expanded in some areas. More than 95% of the sweet potatoes cultivated in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, are Victory No. 100. It is also basically popularized in areas north of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces are actively promoting it. However, on a national scale, the area planted with Victory No. 100 is still limited. If we can switch to planting Victory No. 100 on one-third of the sweet potato area nationwide, and calculate an increase in production of 30% per mu, we can increase grain production for the country by more than 2 billion jin (four jin of sweet potatoes equals one jin of grain). Therefore, vigorously promoting the Victory No. 100 sweet potato is an important way to increase grain production at present.

    种植胜利百号甘薯可以大大提高产量
  　孙淑涵
    胜利百号是甘薯的一个优良品种。它的主要优点是产量高。几年来不论是农场试验或农民种植，它的产量都比本地种高百分之五十以上。山东、福建、安徽、江苏等省各农场试种的结果，胜利百号比当地种平均增产百分之七十四，有的增产一倍半。河南省新野县本地种甘薯每亩平均产一、二千斤，胜利百号能收二千至四千斤，个别产量高的每亩达到一万斤。
    胜利百号甘薯对自然环境的适应性较强，由南到北，山区平川，都适宜种植。它比较能耐旱，生长期短，结薯早，产量高而稳定。夏种的甘薯一般都在“芒种”收麦以后才扦插，下霜时即可收获。在夏秋遇灾的情况下，用甘薯做为晚秋补种作物时，胜利百号甘薯的优点就表现得更为突出。一九五三年安徽省秋旱，九月份一般甘薯还只有指头粗，胜利百号却已有鸡蛋大了。农民高兴地说：“小红帽
  （当地农民对胜利百号甘薯的称呼）可真好。”一九五四年安徽泗县步伦乡小卞村胜利农业生产合作社水灾后补种的胜利百号每亩平均收七百斤；同时补种的本地种甘薯，五亩地总共才收七百斤。据华东农业科学研究所一九五四年试验，晚至八月二十日扦插的胜利百号，只经过七十六天的生长期，就收到了每亩八百五十斤的产量。
    它的另一优点是蔓子短粗，有些直立，节间很少扎根或结成小薯，比一般长蔓种节省大量翻蔓劳力。同时由于它的蔓子短，结薯集中，植株所占面积较小，能适当增加每亩种植株数，提高产量。
    胜利百号的唯一缺点是品质较差，含糖分少。
    几年来由于人民政府提倡，群众欢迎，胜利百号的种植面积在某些地区已逐渐扩大。山东省莱阳专区所栽培甘薯有百分之九十五以上是胜利百号；河北省石家庄以北各地也基本普及。安徽、江苏等省正在积极推广。但就全国范围来说，种植胜利百号的面积还是有限的。如果我们能在全国三分之一的甘薯面积上改种胜利百号，按每亩增产三成计算，就可以为国家增产粮食二十多亿斤（四斤甘薯合一斤粮）。因此大力推广胜利百号甘薯，是目前增产粮食的一种重要办法。
