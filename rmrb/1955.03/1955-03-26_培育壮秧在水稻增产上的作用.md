The role of strong seedlings in increasing rice production has long been correctly evaluated by farmers in various regions based on their long-term labor practice experience. Their saying is: "Good seedlings make half a year's rice," and "Ninety percent of the harvest depends on the seedlings." In recent years, experimental demonstrations by agricultural research institutions in various regions have also proved that strong seedlings have a significant effect on increasing production. According to experiments by the Sichuan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, strong seedlings increased production by 10.4% compared to ordinary weak seedlings. The Nanzheng County Farm in Shaanxi Province planted 133 mu of rice entirely with strong seedlings, resulting in an average yield of 670 jin of rice per mu, an increase of more than 100 jin compared to local farmers planting weak seedlings (thin, hairy seedlings). Furthermore, according to a comparative demonstration in Qiaotang Township, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, strong seedlings increased production by 18.1% compared to thin, hairy seedlings. In 1954, the area where strong seedlings were cultivated in Sichuan, Zhejiang, and other provinces reached about 80% of the total area of seedling fields.

Why can strong seedlings increase production? The cultivation of seedlings during the seedling stage is part of the entire growth and development process of rice. Cultivating strong seedlings during the seedling stage lays a good foundation for the growth and development of rice in the paddy fields. Strong seedlings grow vigorously, regreen quickly after transplanting into the paddy fields, tiller early, and grow and develop quickly, which can ensure increased yield. At the same time, because strong seedlings have strong vitality and strong resistance to adverse environments, the yield is also more stable.

The central link in cultivating strong seedlings is sparse and even sowing. Around this central link, doing a good job in preparing the seedling fields before sowing, applying fertilizer, selecting seeds with salt water or muddy water, and after sowing, draining and irrigating the seedling fields, topdressing fertilizer at the appropriate time, and removing insects and weeds can cultivate strong seedlings.

Based on past experience and this year's situation, the following issues should be noted when cultivating strong seedlings:

First, implementing sparse and even sowing should appropriately expand the area of seedling fields. In 1954, some areas in Liling County, Hunan Province, promoted sparse and even sowing in seedling fields and appropriate close planting without paying attention to expanding the area of seedling fields. As a result, a serious shortage of seedlings occurred during the late rice transplanting of double-cropping rice. After some areas of Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, adopted the sparse and even sowing technology, the amount of seeds sown per mu of seedling field was greatly reduced, but the area of seedling fields was not increased, which also caused a shortage of seedlings. Therefore, when promoting sparse and even sowing, all regions must first accurately calculate the amount of seeds used per mu of paddy field, and then determine the required area of seedling fields based on the amount of seeds used.

Second, implementing cooperative seedling cultivation should pay attention to improving seedling cultivation techniques. In 1954, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in some areas implemented cooperative seedling cultivation, but did not study seedling cultivation techniques well beforehand. As a result, the seedling fields were excessively concentrated, resulting in problems such as unsuitable locations for seedling fields, uneven land preparation, inconsistent irrigation depths, and rotten seedlings. This year, mutual aid cooperative organizations in various regions should pay attention to solving these problems when implementing cooperative seedling cultivation.

Third, sufficient fertilization of seedling fields is an important link in cultivating strong seedlings and an effective way to use fertilizer economically. According to experiments by the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, applying 40 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu of seedling field resulted in an increase of 12 jin per mu in paddy fields compared to applying 20 jin per mu. Applying 60 jin increased production by 28 jin per mu compared to applying 20 jin. Based on the seedlings per mu of seedling field, calculated by transplanting 20 mu of paddy fields, increasing the application of ammonium sulfate by 20 to 40 jin per mu of seedling field can increase production by 240 to 560 jin. If 20 to 40 jin of ammonium sulfate is applied in the paddy fields, it can generally only increase production by 80 to 160 jin. In this way, applying one portion of fertilizer in the seedling field is equivalent to applying three or four portions of fertilizer in the paddy fields.

In addition, doing a good job in making suitable seedling fields and paying attention to sowing at the appropriate time are all issues that should be paid attention to when cultivating seedlings.

    培育壮秧在水稻增产上的作用
    莫定森
    壮秧在水稻增产上的作用，各地农民根据长期劳动实践的体验，很早就做出了正确的评价。他们的说法是：“秧好半年稻”，“十成收量，九成靠秧”。几年来各地农业研究机关试验示范也证明壮秧增产效果显著。据四川省农业科学研究所的试验，壮秧比一般瘦秧增产百分之十点四；陕西省南郑县农场一百三十三亩水稻全部栽植壮秧，结果每亩平均产稻谷六百七十斤，比当地农民插植瘦秧（丝毛秧）的增产一百多斤。又据浙江省金华县桥塘乡的对比示范证明：壮秧比丝毛秧增产达百分之十八点一。四川、浙江等省一九五四年培育壮秧的面积，达到了秧田总面积的百分之八十左右。
    壮秧为什么能够增产呢？秧苗在秧田期的培育，是水稻全部生长发育过程中的一部分；在秧田期育成了健壮的秧苗，就为本田期的禾苗生长发育打好了基础。壮秧生长旺盛，移栽本田后返青快，分蘖早，生长发育快，能够保证提高产量。同时由于壮秧生活力强，抵抗不良环境的能力也很强，产量也比较稳定。
    培育壮秧的中心环节是稀播匀播。围绕这一中心环节，做好播种前的秧田整地，施肥、盐水或泥水选种，和播种后的秧田排水灌水，适期追肥、除虫、除草等工作，就可以培育出健壮的秧苗。
    根据过去的经验和今年的情况，培育壮秧应该注意以下几个问题：
    第一、实行稀播匀播要适当地扩大秧田面积。一九五四年湖南省醴陵县的部分地区，由于推行秧田稀播匀播和适当密植，没有注意扩大秧田面积，结果在双季稻晚造本田插秧时，发生了严重的缺秧现象。陕西省南郑县的部分地区采用稀播匀播技术后，每亩秧田播种量减少很多，而秧田面积没有增加，也同样造成了缺秧。因此各地在推行稀播匀播时，首先要精确计算每亩本田的用种量，然后根据用种量确定所需要的秧田面积。
    第二、实行合作育秧要注意改进育秧技术。一九五四年部分地区的农业生产合作社和互助组，实行合作育秧，事前没有很好研究育秧技术，将秧田过份集中，结果发生了秧田位置不适宜，整地不够平整、灌水深浅不一致和烂秧等毛病。今年各地互助合作组织在实行合作育秧时要注意解决这些问题。
    第三、秧田施肥充足，是培育壮秧的重要环节，也是经济用肥的有效办法。根据华东农业科学研究所试验证明：每亩秧田施用硫酸铵四十斤，比每亩施用二十斤所培育出的秧苗在每亩本田内增产十二斤。施用六十斤的比施用二十斤的每亩增产二十八斤。按每亩秧田的秧苗，以插植二十亩本田计算，而每亩秧田增施硫酸铵二十到四十斤，可增产二百四十到五百六十斤；如在本田内施入二十到四十斤硫酸铵，一般只能增产八十到一百六十斤。这样秧田施用一份肥，就等于本田施用三、四份肥。
    此外，做好合式秧田，注意适期播种，都是在培育秧苗时应该注意到的问题。
