Xinhua News Agency report:

    Qinghai Province has begun its spring plowing and sowing. This year's spring plowing and sowing in Qinghai Province is different from previous years. In the vast fields, organized labor with many people working together has emerged. Male farmers in agricultural production cooperatives hold new-style walking plows, urging on the plowing horses or oxen, while female farmers closely follow behind, breaking up the clods of earth. Production teams are competing with each other, and individuals are also competing. The Sujiahewan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Xining plans to increase the average yield per mu of irrigated land this year by 30 jin compared to the 430 jin in 1954. Some agricultural production cooperatives have begun to use horse-drawn twelve-row seed drills for sowing. This year, farmers in Qinghai Province have come up with many methods to increase fertilizer. For example, dismantling old walls, old kang (heated brick beds), and old cooking stoves, sweeping road surface soil, going up the mountains to find pigeon droppings, sweeping livestock pen manure, building pigsties to accumulate fertilizer, and so on. The average amount of fertilizer applied to irrigated land in the entire Xunhua Salar Autonomous County has increased by approximately 10 percent compared to 1954.

    青海农民开始春耕播种
    青海省春耕播种开始。今年青海省春耕播种和往年不同。在广阔的田野里，出现了许多人在一起的有组织的劳动。农业生产合作社的男农民掌着新式步犁，鞭打着耕马或耕牛前进，女农民紧跟在后面打坷垃（土块）。生产队和生产队在竞赛，个人和个人也在竞赛。西宁市郊区苏家河湾农业生产合作社计划今年水地每亩平均产量比一九五四年的四百三十斤增产三十斤。有些农业生产合作社开始使用马拉十二行条播机播种。今年青海省农民想出很多方法增加肥料。例如：拆换旧墙、旧炕、旧锅头，打扫路面土，上山找鸽子粪和扫牲畜圈肥，修猪圈积肥等等。循化县撒拉族自治区全县水地施肥量平均比一九五四年约增加百分之十。              （据新华社讯）
