Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: On the eve of the issuance of the new Renminbi, a Xinhua News Agency reporter asked Cao Juru, Governor of the People's Bank of China, to answer several questions regarding the exchange of new and old currency. The following are the questions posed by the reporter and the answers from Governor Cao Juru:

	Question: What changes have occurred in the market since the announcement of the order to issue new currency?

	Answer: Since the announcement of the State Council's order to issue new currency, the people of the entire country have unanimously and enthusiastically supported it. The people believe that this is a sign of the further stabilization and consolidation of the Renminbi and a manifestation of the increasing economic strength of our country. They believe that the new currency is attractive, easy to recognize, easy to calculate, easy to remember, and easy to use, and that the government has done a good thing for the people. The people believe that the government's advance announcement of the order to issue new currency proves that the government's issuance of the new Renminbi is entirely in the interests of the people. This is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang reactionary government's sudden announcement of so-called currency reforms, which left the people unable to avoid the losses of "paper money turning to water." Since the announcement of the order to issue new currency, the market situation has been completely normal and active, and prices have been stable. The people's trust and support for the Renminbi is expressed in the people's excitement and joy, redoubled efforts in production and work, and patriotic and law-abiding guarantees from private industrialists and businessmen. More specifically, the number of savings accounts and the amount of savings in the People's Banks in various regions have increased rapidly. In the seven cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, people's savings increased by approximately 100 billion old Renminbi from February 21st to 24th. Similar situations have occurred in other small and medium-sized cities. Farmers' savings in Suining and Shehong counties, Sichuan Province, have increased rapidly, with long terms, some for a fixed term of one year, and large deposits, with deposits of 10 million to 30 million old currency not uncommon. This fully demonstrates the trust of the people of our country in the government and the people's confidence in the further consolidation of the Renminbi in the future.

	Question: The State Council's order stipulates that the main currency to be issued includes a ten-yuan note, but the new currency sample announcements in newspapers on February 21st did not include a description of the ten-yuan note and stated that it would not be issued for the time being. What is the reason for this?

	Answer: We should explain that it is entirely necessary to issue currency with larger denominations, such as the ten-yuan note of the new currency, to adapt to the development of social production and the expansion of commodity circulation. This is completely different from increasing the money supply. We have received letters from the people stating that the face value of the current currency (referring to the old currency) is actually relatively low, and there should be some currency with larger denominations to facilitate large-scale commodity transactions. Based on the experience of 1954, we issued a 50,000-yuan note, which reduced the need to issue five 10,000-yuan notes. This not only saved the state a portion of the cost of printing money, but more importantly, it saved the people time in counting money, which is necessary and convenient for circulation. Because our fiscal revenue and expenditure are now balanced, and the increase or decrease in the total amount of currency in circulation in the market is entirely based on the needs of the amount of commodity circulation in the market, prices are stable and will never change due to the size of the currency denomination.
	We believe that this ten-yuan note should be issued, but in order to accommodate current circulation habits, it will not be issued for the time being.

	Question: The new Renminbi notes are printed with the year "1953" at the bottom. What is the reason for this? Why was it chosen to be issued in March of this year?

	Answer: The preparation work for issuing the new Renminbi began after the currency was stabilized in 1950. Therefore, the preparation was very thorough. The excellent printing technology of the new Renminbi is also a manifestation of thorough preparation.
	The timing of issuing the new Renminbi is now very mature, which is reflected in the fact that all kinds of favorable conditions are now fully available. When the current Renminbi was issued in December 1948, although the victorious situation of the people's revolutionary war had been determined, most parts of the country had not yet been liberated, and the speculation in grain, yarn, gold, silver, and foreign currency left over from the Kuomintang reactionary rule's long-term inflation increased our difficulties. Therefore, when we issued the current Renminbi at that time, we could only solve the problem of unifying the national currency, and it was not possible to solve the problem of national currency stability. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, because the people's revolutionary war had achieved nationwide victory, it was possible to strive for a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, material allocation, and cash revenue and expenditure in order to achieve currency stability, to eliminate the inflation exploitation suffered by the people for more than ten years before liberation, and to stabilize the people's lives. Therefore, within less than half a year after the founding of the country, the government quickly unified financial and economic work and achieved national currency stability. After the government stabilized the currency, it believed that it was entirely necessary to thoroughly eliminate the shortcomings of the current Renminbi, such as the large face value, to make the Renminbi more consolidated and sound, and to facilitate pricing and circulation. This is a necessary condition for carrying out economic construction and stabilizing and improving the people's lives. This measure should have been carried out in 1953, but due to technical reasons, it required a long preparation time, so it was postponed until this year. Now, the national fiscal revenue and expenditure have not only achieved a balance for three consecutive years, but also have a surplus. The state has sufficient power to lead the national market. The people have a deep impression of the long-term price stability in the past five years. The timing of issuing the new Renminbi is very mature.

	The new Renminbi could have been issued on January 1st of this year to facilitate accounting, but because it was the peak season for urban and rural material exchanges at that time, in order to avoid delaying the production and material exchanges of the vast number of farmers, it was chosen to be carried out on March 1st, which is in the off-season.

	Question: What are the specific procedures for exchanging the new Renminbi?

	Answer: Since the issuance of the new Renminbi is for the convenience of the people, the procedures in the exchange work are extremely simple, and the principle should be to facilitate the people as much as possible.
	People who have current Renminbi in hand can exchange it or continue to use it during the period from March 1st to March 31st, as the new and old currencies are in general circulation. State-owned stores will recover the old currency when selling goods. From April 1st, the remaining 50,000-yuan and 10,000-yuan current Renminbi will need to be exchanged, and 5,000-yuan and below can continue to be used. According to the plan of the People's Bank of China, the vast majority of the old currency can be recovered by issuing new currency through various units issuing wages and through state-owned enterprises and cooperatives selling goods.
	The procedures for people who hold old currency to exchange for new currency are extremely simple. They can exchange it themselves at the bank, or various units can collect it and exchange it collectively. When exchanging, only the old currency is handed over and the new currency is received. There is absolutely no need to fill in one's name, address, or occupation. The purpose of handling collective exchanges in various places is to facilitate employees and facilitate exchanges. It should also be explained that the people have the full right to go to exchange independently. Not only that, even when taking money to the bank for savings, you can write your name, or you can not write your name, and you do not need to fill in your address and occupation. If the savings deposit slips originally printed by the People's Banks in various places still have items such as address and occupation printed on them, the savings depositors do not need to fill them in. It is a legitimate thing to exchange or save money in the bank. Article 11 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that the state protects the legitimate income and savings of citizens, which is a clear proof.

	Governor Cao Juru believes that with the unanimous support of the people, the strengthened leadership of Party and government organizations in various regions, and the close cooperation of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and the People's Bank of China, the issuance of the new currency will definitely be successfully completed.

    中国人民银行行长曹菊如
    就新旧币兑换几个问题发表谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】在新的人民币开始发行的前夕，新华社记者就新旧币兑换工作中的几个问题，提请中国人民银行行长曹菊如答复。下面是记者提出的问题和曹菊如行长的答复：
    问：发行新币命令公布以来，市场情况有什么变化？
    答：国务院发行新币的命令公布以后，全国人民是一致热烈拥护的。人民群众一致认为这是人民币进一步稳定和巩固的表现，是我国经济力量日益强大的表现，认为新币好看、好认、好算、好记、好使，政府为人民办了一件好事。人民群众认为，从政府提前公布发行新币的命令，就证明了政府发行新的人民币是完全符合于人民的利益的，这与过去国民党反动政府突然公布所谓币制改革，使人民无法躲避“票子化水”的损失，是根本不相同的。发行新币命令公布以来，市场情况是完全正常的，活跃的，物价是平稳的。人民对于人民币的信任和拥护，表现为人民感到兴奋和愉快，加倍地努力生产和努力工作，私营工商业者也提出爱国守法的保证。更加具体的表现则是各地人民银行储蓄的户数和金额都迅速增加，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安七个城市自二月二十一日至二十四日，人民储蓄就增加了约一千亿元旧人民币。其他中小城市也有类似的情况。四川省遂宁、射洪两县农民储蓄迅速增加，期限很长，有定期一年的，存款额大，存一千万元至三千万元旧币的不在少数。这种情况充分说明了我国人民对于政府的信任，人民对于人民币今后更加巩固的信心。
    问：国务院命令规定应发行的主币中，有十元券一种，但二月二十一日各地报纸上公告的新币票样说明中，没有十元券的说明，而且注明暂不发行，这是什么缘故？
    答：我们应该说明，适应于社会生产的发展，商品流通的扩大，发行票面额较大的货币，例如十元券的新币，是完全有必要的，这与增发货币截然是两回事情。我们曾经接到人民来信，认为目前现有货币（指旧币）的票面额实际上是较低的，应该有一些票面额较大的货币，以便利大宗的商品交易。根据一九五四年的经验，我们发行了一张五万元的票子，就可以少发五张一万元的票子，不仅节省了国家一部分印钞费用，更重要的是节省了人民点票计算的时间，这对于流通是必要的、而且是方便的。由于我们现在财政收支已经平衡，市场上货币流通总量的增减完全根据于市场上商品流通量的需要，所以物价是平稳的，绝不会因货币票面额的大小而起变化。
    这种十元券我们认为是应该发行的，但是为了照顾当前流通的习惯，暂时还不发行。
    问：新的人民币票券下端印有一九五三年的字样，是什么缘故？为什么又选择在今年三月来发行？
    答：发行新的人民币的准备工作，是一九五零年货币稳定以后就开始进行的，因此，准备是很充分的。新人民币的印制技术精良，也是准备充分的一种表现。
    目前发行新的人民币的时机是十分成熟的，这表现在目前已经完全具备了各种有利的条件。一九四八年十二月发行现行人民币时，当时人民革命战争的胜利局面虽然已经确定，但是全国大部分地区还没有解放，而国民党反动统治长时期通货膨胀所遗留下来的粮食、纱布、金、银、外币投机也增加了我们的困难，因此当时我们发行现行的人民币，只能解决统一全国货币的问题，还没有可能来解决全国货币稳定的问题。中央人民政府成立以后，由于人民革命战争已经获得全国规模的胜利，已有可能争取财政收支、物资调拨、现金收支的平衡，以实现通货的稳定，解除人民在解放以前十多年来所忍受的通货膨胀剥削，使人民生活得到稳定，因此在建国以后不到半年的时间之内，政府迅即统一财政经济工作，实现了全国通货的稳定。政府于通货稳定以后，即认为彻底扫除现行人民币的票面额较大等缺点，使人民币更加巩固和健全，以便于计价流通，是完全必要的，这是进行经济建设及稳定和提高人民生活的必要条件。这一措施在一九五三年原即应该进行，但是由于技术原因，需要较长的准备时间，所以推迟到今年才进行。现在，全国财政收支接连三年不仅达到了收支平衡，而且拥有结余，国家已拥有充分的力量领导全国的市场，人民对五年来物价的长时期平稳已经有了深刻的印象，发行新的人民币的时机已经十分成熟。
    发行新的人民币，本来可以在今年一月一日来进行，以便利账务处理，但由于当时正在城乡物资交流的旺季，为避免耽误广大农民的生产和物资交流，因此选择处在淡季的三月一日来进行。
    问：兑换新的人民币的具体手续怎样？
    答：新的人民币的发行既然是为了便利人民，因此在兑换工作中手续极其简单，应以尽量便利人民为原则。
    手头存有现行人民币的人，在三月一日至三月三十一日期间，由于新币和旧币通用，可以兑换，也可以继续使用，由国营商店在卖货时收回。四月一日起，剩下来的五万元和一万元现行人民币，才需要兑换，五千元和五千元以下的还可继续使用。按照人民银行的计划，通过各单位发工资等方式发出新币，通过国营企业、合作社售货的方式收回旧币，就可以把绝大部分的旧币收回。
    持有旧币的人，如果要兑换新币，手续极其简单。可以由自己到银行兑换，也可以由各单位凑齐去集体兑换。兑换时只是交旧币，领新币，完全不需要填报自己的姓名、住址、职业。各地办理集体兑换，其目的原是为了方便职工，便利兑换，应同时说明人民群众完全有自己单独前往兑换的权利。不仅这样，即是拿钱到银行去储蓄时，也可以写自己的姓名，也可以不写自己的姓名，更不必填写住址和职业。各地人民银行原来印的储蓄存款单据上如果还印有住址、职业等项目，储蓄户可以不填。有钱在银行兑换或储蓄，这是一件正当的事情，中华人民共和国宪法第十一条中规定国家保护公民的合法收入和储蓄，就是一个明证。
    曹菊如行长认为在人民一致拥护，各地党政加强领导以及国营企业、合作社和人民银行的密切配合之下，新币发行工作是一定能够顺利完成的。
