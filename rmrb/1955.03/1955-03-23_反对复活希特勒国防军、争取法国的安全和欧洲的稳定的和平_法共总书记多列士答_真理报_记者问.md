Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 21st: "Pravda" published Maurice Thorez's answers to questions posed by "Pravda" reporters under the title "Oppose the Revival of Hitler's Wehrmacht, Strive for France's Security and Europe's Stable Peace."

"Pravda" wrote that Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, received "Pravda" reporters Zhukov and Rasakin and answered questions related to a number of urgent and pressing political issues in France. The questions from the "Pravda" reporters and Maurice Thorez's answers are as follows:

Question: Now, on the eve of the debates in the French Republic Senate, the supporters of the Paris Agreements insist that it is necessary to ratify these agreements because of the need to maintain "Atlantic solidarity," and that ratifying these agreements will help strengthen European security, especially French security. What is your opinion on this?

Answer: The very fact that political leaders view the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements solely from the perspective of maintaining "Atlantic solidarity" shows that they are putting foreign interests above national interests.

The Paris Agreements give the Bonn revanchists an opportunity to build an army, which poses a direct threat to France and other German neighbors who are our country's natural allies. They undermine France's security, whereas if the French government accepted the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an all-European conference to establish a collective security system, it would be able to help strengthen France's security.

France has long been one of the main victims of German imperialism, which has been obsessed with conquest. In a century, their armed forces have occupied and ravaged our territory three times.

In this regard, the French cannot forget that after June 1940 (when Hitler's army invaded France), the American leaders acted as if our country simply did not exist. The United States and Britain then pursued their traditional imperialist policies: their aim was to seize France's inheritance.

In the current period, the infamous "Atlantic solidarity" is merely a front for the interests of American monopoly capitalists. The ruling French bourgeois groups, fearing the democratic forces of our people after 1947, sold France's national independence to American monopoly capitalists.

The result of implementing this policy, in terms of economy and industry, as well as in science and culture, is that we have abandoned the possibility of our country's progress and free development.

On the international stage, "Atlantic solidarity" subordinates France to the United States. Our country is no longer able to determine its own policies.

The American plot to place Morocco under its control is well known to everyone. Everyone is also aware of the fact that the United States shamelessly interferes in southern Indochina.

Recently, American politicians even promoted the conclusion of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty without consulting France, even though France is one of the signatories of the tripartite declaration on these regions.

At the same time, the governments of Washington and London are using all sorts of tricks to make the Saar issue a source of conflict between France and Germany.

The result of abandoning an independent national policy is that our country has been reduced to a second-rate power, sacrificing its interests as a great power.

The rulers of France are already reaping the bitter fruit of their actions. They have heard Labor leader Attlee say that France can no longer be considered a fully qualified partner and suggest that a tripartite conference be held without its participation. The British Prime Minister has reduced our country's status to that of a "medium" power – if not a "small" one – and praised the strong Germanic race to the cheers of the Conservative Party. Churchill is already talking about giving the "French empty seat" to another country.

Once our country agrees to the establishment of twelve divisions by the Bonn government as a starting point, as it has requested, the rulers in London and Washington will no longer consider it necessary to take Paris into account. Does not the fact that Franco, under their protection, dared to advocate a few days ago that French democracy, caught between fascist Spain and reactionary West Germany, should be "restrained" illustrate the problem?

"Atlantic solidarity" is synonymous with France's shame and weakness.

Question: Supporters of the Paris Agreements believe that ratifying these agreements will promote Franco-German "reconciliation." What is your opinion on this?

Answer: One must not confuse the warmongering conspiracies of arms dealers with reconciliation between the peoples of France and Germany.

The Paris Agreements are an obstacle to Franco-German friendship, in the sense that their purpose, as already mentioned, is to help reactionary Germany against the Germany seeking liberation.

In West Germany, these agreements create favorable conditions for militarist and imperialist forces. These agreements are directed against the forces of the people, which we hailed as early as 1946 as the only guarantee for Germany's democratic and peaceful development, even though those forces were still weak at the time.

Since then, the forces of the people have grown stronger. The German Democratic Republic, which is building a new life, has become an important factor for peace in Europe.

In West Germany, the main organizations of the working class – parties and trade unions – have expressed the sentiments of the majority of the people and are resolutely fighting against the Paris Agreements. The attitude of the Social Democratic Party reflects the deep feelings of the masses, who fully recognize that the revival of militarism will mean putting Hitlerites in leadership positions. By supporting the Paris Agreements, the leaders of the French Socialist Party are siding with Adenauer against the Social Democratic workers of Germany. They are simultaneously betraying the cause of proletarian internationalism and the interests of France.

For the first time in many years, German youth are strongly refusing to be cannon fodder for the imperialists.

This is the force that exists in Germany that makes reconciliation and friendship with the French people possible. German militarism, on the contrary, is a constant threat to France's peace and security and is an instrument for suppressing the aspirations of our people who are fighting for democracy and national independence.

Question: French political leaders say that after the Paris Agreements are ratified, it will be possible to immediately begin four-power negotiations on the German question, especially the reunification of Germany.

They also say that it will then be possible to avoid implementing the Paris Agreements. What is your opinion on this way of framing the issue?

Answer: This way of framing the issue is a deliberate lie. One cannot seriously say that the revival of West German militarism will lead to a peaceful solution to the German question. How can the peoples of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies agree to negotiate on the basis of agreements that are openly directed against their own security? If there is a sincere desire to normalize international relations, one cannot start by poisoning the atmosphere of those relations.

What we are actually seeing is a manifestation of the American "position of strength" policy. Anyone with a clear head knows that this is a policy of illusion, because the Soviet Union and the people's democracies possess immense power – they cannot be intimidated.

The German people themselves also understand that the advocates of building a new Wehrmacht want to make it impossible for them to unite in an independent, democratic, and peace-loving country, and that, on the contrary, these people are preparing a war of fratricide among Germans.

By wanting to keep Germany divided, rearming the western part of the country and incorporating it into the aggressive Atlantic bloc, the supporters of the Paris Agreements are depriving the issues they claim to want to discuss of any substance and making negotiations meaningless. These people talk about peace and unity, but they have chosen the path of division, violence, and war.

Question: It is known that if the Paris Agreements are approved, the result will be the abolition of the Franco-Soviet Treaty, and in the eyes of the Soviet people, France's participation in the plan to revive German militarism is incompatible with this treaty.

In this situation, how do you assess the possibility of maintaining and strengthening the traditional cooperation between the French and Soviet peoples in the struggle for peace in Europe?

Answer: When the Soviet people say that the treaty of alliance and mutual assistance between our two countries is incompatible with France's participation in the plan to revive German militarism, they are expressing an opinion that every honest and insightful Frenchman can understand. The reconstruction of the aggressive German Wehrmacht cannot but violate the content of this treaty, which stipulates that both parties must jointly take "all necessary measures to eliminate the new threat from the German side." Integrating West Germany into the Atlantic system cannot but violate this obligation undertaken by the contracting parties – "The contracting parties undertake never to conclude any alliance against the other contracting party, nor to participate in any group directed against the other contracting party."

The French rulers who fully understand the essence of this issue, if they promote the ratification of the Paris Agreements, will make the annulment of the Franco-Soviet Treaty inevitable. It is known that in order for West Germany to participate in the Brussels Treaty of March 17, 1948, the contracting parties to this treaty had to make significant amendments to the text of this treaty: the protocol of October 23, 1954, deleted the provision: "To take steps that may be deemed necessary in the event that Germany resumes a policy of aggression."

Nothing could be clearer than this recognition of the incompatibility and fundamental contradiction between the Franco-Soviet Treaty, which places the struggle against the possible resurgence of the German threat in the most important position, and the Paris Agreements, which directly lead to such a resurgence.

But experience shows that for us French, the Franco-Soviet alliance is an indispensable factor for security and peace; it is the primary condition for our country's freedom of action, our exercise of effective sovereignty, and the survival of France, which borders expansionist Germany. History has proven that the Soviet Union needs France less than France needs the Soviet Union.

The revival of German militarism is a threat to our people, which was already evident in the period between the two world wars. Only the short-sighted policies of the French bourgeois ruling groups, who both hated and feared the working class and the democratic movement, forced them to conceal the fact that the German militarist aggression plan was primarily directed against France. It was this policy, which buried the Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1935 in Munich, that prepared Hitler's aggression and caused our country to suffer defeat and occupation in 1940.

Those who guide French policy, ignoring the terrible lessons of the past, are once again promoting the restoration of German military power and are once again restoring the absurd and sinful anti-Soviet policy. But the government and the people are not the same thing.

The French people will never allow themselves to be drawn into a war against the Soviet Union, which has no interests that contradict the interests of our country, which has never taken aggressive actions against us, and which, on the contrary, has made such great efforts to save us from Hitler's barbarous rule.

The balance of internal forces in our country is very different from what it was in the Munich era.

If the French government ratifies the Paris Agreements, thus turning the Franco-Soviet Treaty into a scrap of paper, this will inspire the working class and democrats to redouble their efforts to maintain and develop the traditional cooperation between our two peoples, which, to use an old saying from the 1848 era, is a "natural calling."

The French officials who intend to tear up the Franco-Soviet Treaty will believe that it is impossible to destroy what constitutes the true alliance between the two peoples.

Question: The Soviet public is actively participating in the struggle for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of international supervision over the implementation of these measures. In the Soviet Union, the movement to collect signatures for the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world against preparing for atomic war will begin on April 1. What would you like to say about the attitude of the French people towards these issues?

Answer: A few years ago, seventeen million French men and women signed the Stockholm Appeal calling for a ban on atomic weapons. The participation of 600 million people in this movement was a decisive fact that prevented the aggressors from launching an atomic war in Korea and Indochina.

The National Peace Council has taken the necessary measures to ensure that the new call announced in Vienna will receive a huge response in our country. Peace advocates of various tendencies will begin collecting signatures. Communists consider it their duty to participate most actively in this movement.

Since the Paris Agreements, once ratified, would make the revived Wehrmacht an instigator of atomic war, the French people have even more reason to fight for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of supervision over the implementation of these measures. These agreements will in effect enable West Germany to study and manufacture thermonuclear bombs within the framework of "armaments coordination," as the French Foreign Minister admitted a few days ago in a relevant committee of the National Assembly; on the other hand, the United States will supply atomic weapons to its favored ally, the Bonn government.

In such circumstances, the vast majority of the French people, in particular, will enthusiastically respond to the call of the World Peace Council.

Question: In the current situation, how do you assess the prospects for the French people's struggle to maintain and strengthen peace and security, to safeguard France's national independence and its great power status in international affairs?

Answer: The recent achievements of the struggle show that since 1947, the fighters for peace, security, and France's national independence have achieved great success. Last year, our people finally rejected the European Defence Community plan and contributed to the establishment of peace in Indochina.

The unity between various social strata has been maintained and strengthened; they are opposing, under the leadership of the working class, the current foreign policy that is fundamentally in conflict with our country's interests.

For our people, the main danger today is underestimating the great significance of the forces participating in this struggle. An unprecedentedly large mass of workers, working peasants, office employees, and civil servants, as well as a considerable part of the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie, are gradually realizing that the "Atlantic" policy and its further development can only accelerate the arms race and increase military spending, which will make the possibility of satisfying the most urgent social demands even more remote. The gap between the government's actions and the hopes of the masses is becoming increasingly alarming.

The current government is by no means stable. Because this government supports the Paris Agreements that the people have rejected, it has become very unpopular from the start. The recent vote in the National Assembly has shown that this government's position in the parliament is very unstable.

To achieve new victories, we must wage a persistent struggle to win the unity of the working class, the unity of all democrats, patriots, and peace advocates. Communists are dedicating all their strength to unite these powerful forces that have emerged from our people, to fight against those who are selling out the country.

The French people know that they are not isolated in their struggle. In today's world, all peoples who defend their national sovereignty receive sympathy and support. For example, France has obtained the strong support of the peoples of colonies and dependencies who are eager for self-determination, if it implements a democratic policy and recognizes their demands as legitimate.

The Soviet Union, New China, and the people's democracies of Europe and Asia represent one-third of all mankind. Their strength, which is entirely devoted to peace and socialism, has never been as great and united as it is today. Everyone sees that the Soviet Union is providing tireless support to all peoples who defend their independence.

In capitalist countries, the masses are rising up against the rule of American imperialism and against its war policies. The people are using the inevitable contradictions between capitalist countries to serve their own interests. A world-scale, unprecedentedly powerful movement has united all peace advocates.

Therefore, if the French people free themselves from foreign guardianship and defend the interests of peace and universal security, they will inevitably benefit from a most important factor: they will certainly receive the support of the world-wide anti-imperialist camp, whose material and moral strength is growing day by day. It is impossible to reverse these forces, just as it is impossible to turn back the wheel of history.

    反对复活希特勒国防军、争取法国的安全和欧洲的稳定的和平
    ——法共总书记多列士答“真理报”记者问
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日电：“真理报”以“反对复活希特勒国防军、争取法国的安全和欧洲的稳定的和平”为题发表了莫里斯·多列士对“真理报”记者所提问题的答复。
    “真理报”写道，法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士接见了“真理报”记者茹科夫和拉萨金，并回答了和法国的若干紧急迫切的政治问题有关的问题。“真理报”记者的问题和莫里斯·多列士的答复如下：
    问：现在，在法国共和国参议院举行辩论的前夕，巴黎协定的支持者们硬说要批准这些协定是由于有必要保持“大西洋的团结”，并且硬说批准这些协定有助于加强欧洲的安全，特别是法国的安全。你对这一点的意见如何？
    答：政界领袖们仅仅从保持“大西洋团结”的角度来看批准巴黎协定问题这一事实本身就说明他们是把外国的利益放在民族利益之上的。
    巴黎协定给波恩复仇主义者以建立一支军队的机会，就是给法国和作为我们国家的天然盟国的其他德国邻国造成一个直接的威胁。它们有损法国的安全，而如果接受苏联关于召开全欧会议以建立集体安全体系的建议，法国政府是能够帮助加强法国的安全的。
    法国长期以来一直是醉心于征服的德国帝国主义者的主要受害者之一。在一个世纪中，他们的武装部队曾三次强占和蹂躏我们的国土。
    在这方面，法国人不能忘记，在一九四○年六月（希特勒军队侵入法国）以后，美国的领袖们实际上表现得好像是我们的国家根本不存在了。美国和英国当时奉行着它们的传统的帝国主义政策：它们的目的是抢夺法国的遗产。
    在目前时期，臭名昭彰的“大西洋团结”只不过是美国垄断资本家利益的一个幌子，法国资产阶级统治集团在一九四七年后由于害怕我们人民的民主力量而把法国的民族独立卖给了美国垄断资本家。
    在经济和工业方面，正如在科学和文化方面一样，实施这种政策的结果是放弃了我们国家进步和自由发展的可能性。
    在国际舞台上，“大西洋团结”使法国从属于美国。我们的国家已不再能决定自己的政策了。
    美国要把摩洛哥置于它的控制之下的阴谋是大家都清楚知道的。大家也都清楚知道美国无耻地插手印度支那南部这一事实。
    最近，美国政治家们甚至不征询法国的意见就促成了土耳其—伊拉克条约的缔结，虽然法国是关于这些地区的三国宣言的签字国之一。
    同时华盛顿和伦敦政府使用各式各样的诡计来使萨尔问题成为德法两国之间的纠纷的根源。
    放弃独立的国家政策的结果使我国降为一个二等国，结果就是牺牲它作为一个大国的种种利益。
    法国的统治者已在自食其果了，他们已听到工党领袖艾德礼说，法国已不能再算是一个有充分资格的伙伴并建议在没有它参加之下召开三国会议。英国首相则把我们的国家的地位变为一个“中等”国家——如果说不是一个“小”国的话——的地位，并且在保守党的欢呼声中赞扬强有力的日耳曼种族。邱吉尔已经在谈论把“法国的空席位”给予别的国家了。
    一旦我国同意波恩政府像它所要求的那样建立十二个师作为一个开端，伦敦和华盛顿的统治者们就将不再认为有必要考虑到巴黎了。在他们卵翼之下的佛朗哥前几天竟主张对处于法西斯西班牙和反动的西德两面夹攻之下的法国民主“加以约束”，难道这不能说明问题吗？
      “大西洋团结”就是法国的耻辱和软弱的同义语。
    问：巴黎协定的支持者认为，批准这些协定将促进法德“和解”。你对这一点的意见如何？
    答：一定不能把军火商人的好战阴谋同法德两国人民之间的和解混为一谈。
    巴黎协定是法德友谊的障碍，是从这样一个意义来说的，这就是，它们的目的，像前面已经说过的，是帮助反动的德国来反对寻求解放的德国。
    在西德，这些协定为军国主义和帝国主义势力创造了有利的条件。这些协定是针对着人民的力量的，早在一九四六年，我们就为这种力量欢呼，认为它是德国的民主和和平发展的唯一保证，尽管当时这种力量还是薄弱的。
    从那时起，人民的力量壮大了。正在建设新生活的德意志民主共和国已经成为欧洲和平的重要因素。
    在西德，工人阶级的各主要组织——政党和工会——表示了大多数人民的情绪，坚决进行反对巴黎协定的斗争。社会民主党的态度反映了群众的深切的情绪，他们充分认识到，军国主义的复活将意味着把希特勒分子放在领导地位。法国社会党的领袖们支持巴黎协定，从而就是同阿登纳一道，反对德国的社会党工人们。他们同时背叛了无产阶级国际主义事业和法国的利益。
    德国青年在许多年来第一次有力地拒绝为帝国主义者当炮灰。
    这就是在德国存在的使得同法国人民的和解和友好成为可能的力量。至于德国军国主义，正相反，它是对法国的和平和安全的经常威胁，并且是压制我们的正在为民主和民族独立而奋斗的人民的愿望的工具。
    问：法国政界领袖们说，在巴黎协定得到批准之后，就有可能立即开始就德国问题，特别是德国的重新统一问题举行四国谈判。
    他们又说，这样就有可能避免实施巴黎协定。你对于这个问题的这样一种提法有什么意见？
    答：对这个问题的这样一种提法是故意扯谎。人们不能认真地说，西德军国主义的复活将导致德国问题的和平解决。苏联和各人民民主国家的人民怎么能够同意在公开针对着他们自己的安全的协定的基础上进行谈判呢？如果真心诚意地希望使国际关系正常化的话，那么就不能从毒化这种关系的气氛着手。
    我们实际上看到的是美国的“实力地位”政策的表现。任何头脑清醒的人都知道这是一种幻想的政策，因为苏联和各人民民主国家拥有无比的力量——它们是吓不倒的。
    德国人民自己也了解，建立新国防军的鼓吹者要使他们不再有可能统一在一个独立、民主和爱好和平的国家中，而且恰恰相反，这些人正在准备德国人之间自相残杀的战争。
    由于要使德国继续处于分裂状态，重新武装这个国家的西部并把它并入侵略性的大西洋集团，巴黎协定的支持者们便使他们硬说他们希望要讨论的问题失去了内容并且使谈判成为没有意义。这些人高谈和平和统一，但是他们却选择了分裂、暴力和战争的道路。　　　　
    问：大家知道如果巴黎协定获得批准，结果将导致法苏条约的废除，在苏联人民看来，法国参加复活德国军国主义的计划是和这个条约不相容的。
    在这种情况下，你怎样估计保持和加强法国人民同苏联人民在争取欧洲和平的斗争中的传统合作的可能性呢？
    答：当苏联人民说我们两国间的同盟互助条约同法国参加复活德国军国主义的计划不相容的时候，他们表示了每一个正直的和有见识的法国人可以理解的意见。重建侵略性的德国国防军是不可能不违反这个条约的内容的，条约规定双方必须共同采取“一切必要措施，以消灭来自德方的新威胁”。把西德并入大西洋体系是不可能不违反这个条约的缔约国所承担的这个义务的——“缔约国双方承允决不缔结反对缔约国另一方之任何同盟，亦决不参加反对缔约国另一方之任何集团”。
    充分了解这个问题的实质的法国统治者们如果促使巴黎协定获得批准，就将使法苏条约的作废成为不可避免的了。大家知道，为了使西德可以参加一九四八年三月十七日的布鲁塞尔条约，这个条约的各缔约国已不得不对这个条约的本文作了重要的修改：一九五四年十月二十三日的议定书上删除了这一条规定：“采取在一旦德国重新采取侵略政策时可能认为有必要采取的步骤。”
    没有什么比这更清楚地承认这个把反对德国威胁的可能再起的斗争放在最重要地位的法苏条约同直接导向这种威胁的再起的巴黎协定之间的不相容和根本矛盾的了。
    但是经验表明，对我们法国人来说，法苏同盟是安全和和平的不可缺少的因素；它是我国的行动自由、我国行使有效的主权和同扩张主义的德国接壤的法国的生存的首要条件。历史已经证明，苏联需要法国的程度比法国需要苏联的程度小得多。
    德国军国主义的复活是对我国人民的威胁，这一点在两次世界大战之间的那段时期中就已经很明显了。只有既痛恨又畏惧工人阶级和民主运动的法国资产阶级统治集团的眼光短浅的政策才使他们不得不掩饰这一事实：德国军国主义的侵略计划首先是针对着法国的。正是这种在慕尼黑葬送了一九三五年的法苏条约的政策准备了希特勒的侵略，并且使我国在一九四○年遭受失败和被占领。
    指导法国政策的人们不顾过去的可怕教训，竟又在促使德国军事力量的恢复，并且又在恢复荒谬的罪恶的反苏政策。但是政府和人民并不是同一回事。
    法国人民绝不会让自己卷入一场反对苏联的战争，苏联没有任何同我们国家的利益相矛盾的利益，它从来没有采取过侵略我们的行动，相反地，它曾作了这样大的努力把我们从希特勒的野蛮统治下拯救出来。
    我们国内内部的力量对比已经同慕尼黑时代大不相同了。
    假如法国政府使巴黎协定得到批准，因而把法苏条约变成一张废纸的话，那么这就会激起工人阶级和民主人士加倍努力来保持和发展我们两国人民之间的传统的合作，用一八四八年时代的一句老话来说，这种合作是一种“自然的召唤”。
    打算撕毁法苏条约的法国官方人士将会相信：要破坏构成这两国人民之间的真正联盟的那种东西是不可能的。问：苏联公众正积极地参加争取裁减军备、禁止原子武器和对这些措施的实行建立国际监督的斗争。在苏联，为世界和平理事会反对准备原子战争的告全世界人民书征集签名的运动将在四月一日开始。你关于法国人民对这些问题的态度愿意说些什么呢？
    答：几年以前，一千七百万法国男女在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。六亿人参加了这个运动曾经是使侵略者不敢在朝鲜和印度支那发动原子战争的一个决定性的事实。
    全国和平理事会已经采取必要措施，以使在维也纳公布的新的号召在我国得到巨大的反响。各种不同倾向的和平拥护者将开始征集签名。共产党员认为最积极地参加这个运动是他们的责任。
    由于巴黎协定一旦批准就会使复活起来的国防军成为原子战争的引火者，法国人民更有理由来为裁减军备、禁止原子武器和对这些措施的实行建立监督而斗争。这些协定将实际上使西德可以在“军备统筹”的范围内研究和制造热核子炸弹，这是前几天法国外交部长在国民议会的一个有关的委员会中承认的；另一方面，美国将把原子武器供给它所偏爱的盟友波恩政府。
    在这样的情况下，特别是法国人民，绝大多数将热烈地响应世界和平理事会的号召。
    问：在目前的情况下，你如何估计法国人民为维护和加强和平和安全、保障法国的民族独立和它在国际事务中的大国地位而进行的斗争的前景？
    答：最近的斗争成果表明，自一九四七年以来，争取和平、安全和法国的民族独立的战士们已取得巨大的成功。去年，我们的人民终于否决了欧洲防务集团计划，并且促成了印度支那的和平的建立。
    各个极不相同的社会阶层间的团结保持了并且加强了；它们正在工人阶级的领导下反对同我国利益根本抵触的目前的外交政策。
    对我国人民来说，今天的主要危险就是过低估计参加这个斗争的力量的重大意义。现在空前广大的工人、劳动农民、机关雇员和公务员群众以及相当大的一部分城乡小资产阶级渐渐了解到：“大西洋”方针和它的进一步发展只能加速军备竞赛和增加军事开支，这样将使得满足最迫切的社会要求的可能性更加渺茫了。政府的行动同群众的希望之间的鸿沟变得愈来愈是惊人。
    目前的政府绝不是稳固的。由于这个政府支持人民所拒绝的巴黎协定，所以它从一开始就已变得非常不得人心了。国民议会最近的表决已表明，这个政府在议会中的地位是非常不稳定的。
    要取得新的胜利，我们必须为争取工人阶级的团结，一切民主人士、爱国者、和平拥护者的团结而进行坚持不懈地斗争。共产党人正在献出他们的一切力量来团结从我国人民中间产生的这些强大的力量，为反对出卖国家的人们而斗争。
    法国人民知道，他们在他们的斗争中不是孤立的。在今天的世界上，维护自己的民族主权的各国人民都受到同情和支持。例如法国就曾取得渴望自决的殖民地和附属国人民的坚决支持，假如它执行一种民主政策，承认他们的要求为合法的话。
    苏联、新中国和欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家代表全人类的三分之一。它们的完全为和平和社会主义服务的力量从来没有像今天这样的强大和团结。人人都看到，苏联正在给予维护自己的独立的各国人民以不倦的支持。
    在资本主义国家中，群众正在起来反对美帝国主义的统治并且反对它的战争政策。人民群众利用资本主义国家之间的不可避免的矛盾来为他们自己的利益服务。一个世界规模的、史无前例的强有力的运动团结了一切和平拥护者。
    因此，假如法国人民摆脱外国的监护，并且维护和平和普遍安全的利益，那么，他们必然会从这样一个最重要的因素得到好处：他们一定会得到世界范围的反帝国主义阵营的支持，这个阵营的物质和道义力量正在日益壮大。想使这些力量倒退是不可能的，正如想扭转历史的车轮是不可能的一样。
