Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 17th: While the American and British authorities are blatantly using diplomatic and propaganda pressure on the French parliament, the French Faure government is also intensifying its offensive against the members of the Council of the Republic (Senate), attempting to coerce them into passing the Paris Agreements without amendments during the formal debate that will begin on the 22nd.

    The Foreign Affairs Committee and the National Defense Committee of the Council of the Republic had already approved the ratification of the Paris Agreements without amendments on the 16th. Reuters reported that this was the result of the Faure government's "arduous work over the past two weeks to deal with the anti-ratification movement."

    The day before the Foreign Affairs Committee and the National Defense Committee of the Council of the Republic approved the Paris Agreements, French Prime Minister Faure attended a joint meeting of the two committees, emphasizing the "necessity" of promoting the ratification of the Paris Agreements to the parliamentarians. Faure said that the foreign policies of the United States and Britain are to rearm West Germany, and if France does not yield to the demands of the United States and Britain, France will be in "diplomatic isolation." He openly stated that France "has no other choice" because the United States and Britain have already decided to rearm West Germany regardless; and if France refuses, West Germany will replace France to form a new tripartite alliance with the United States and Britain.

    Faure repeated the deceptive clichés of the supporters of the Paris Agreements, insisting that the ratification of the Paris Agreements would not hinder but would "promote" East-West negotiations. At the same time, he also stated that the ratification of the Paris Agreements would "promote cooperation" among the member states of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" in resolving "contentious issues" in Asia and Africa.

    On the 16th, Faure reiterated at a press conference held in Paris that his government would "strive" for the Council of the Republic to conduct discussions on the scheduled date (i.e., March 22nd) and approve the Paris Agreements without any amendments. When answering questions about the possibility of East-West negotiations, Faure insisted that it would be impossible to hold any negotiations before the Paris Agreements were ratified.

    富尔政府加施压力
    图使参议院批准巴黎协定
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎消息：和美英当局在外交上和宣传上对法国议会露骨地使用压力的同时，法国富尔政府也向共和国参议院的议员们加紧发动攻势，企图胁迫他们在即将在二十二日开始的正式辩论中不加修正地通过巴黎协定。
    共和国参议院外交委员会和国防委员会已经在十六日分别不加修正地通过了批准巴黎协定的法案。路透社消息指出，这是富尔政府在过去两周中“进行艰苦工作以对付反批准运动”的结果。
    共和国参议院外交委员会和国防委员会批准巴黎协定的前一天，法国总理富尔出席了两个委员会的联席会议，向议员们强调宣传批准巴黎协定的“必要”。富尔说，美国和英国的外交政策是要重新武装西德的，如果法国不向美国和英国的要求屈服，法国将处于“外交上的孤立地位”。他公然说，法国“没有其他选择”，因为美国和英国已经决定无论如何要重新武装西德；而且如果法国拒绝的话，西德就会代替法国来同美国和英国组成新的三国联盟。
    富尔重复巴黎协定支持者的欺骗性的滥调，硬说批准巴黎协定不但不会妨碍反而会“促进”东西方谈判。同时，他还表示，批准巴黎协定会“促进北大西洋公约组织”各成员国在解决亚洲和非洲的“争执的问题”上的“合作”。
    十六日，富尔在巴黎举行的记者招待会上重申他的政府将“争取”共和国参议院在规定日期（即三月二十二日）进行讨论，并且不加任何修正而批准巴黎协定。富尔在回答关于东西方谈判可能性的问题时，硬说，在批准巴黎协定之前，举行任何谈判都是不可能的。
