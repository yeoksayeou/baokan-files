    Sales Staff Improve Service Attitude
    Zhang Wei
    In Wuhan, as in other cities, people deeply love and trust their state-owned stores and cooperative stores. However, enthusiastic customers often encounter cold faces and rude attitudes from some sales staff. At a session of the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress, representatives criticized this attitude of the sales staff, demanding that they treat customers with "patience with a hundred choices, patience with a hundred questions."
    The criticism from the People's Representatives educated the staff of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in Wuhan. The sales staff of the Wuhan Department Store's central store held multiple discussions and examined their own service attitudes. In the past, some people had the mistaken idea that people looked down on the work of sales staff, and if they provided even better service to customers, they would further "lower" their "status." Some thought: "Customers pay money for goods, and I sell goods for money; if they want to buy, they will buy, and if they don't want to buy, good service won't help." Therefore, they lacked enthusiasm in dealing with customers, and became annoyed when some customers selected several styles or asked a few more questions. Some even argued with customers. Some sales staff with better service attitudes did not understand why they should be "good" or what constituted "good," so they were not enthusiastic or caring enough towards customers. Through this study, they understood that sales staff must be kind, amiable, and caring towards customers. They understood that the quality of the sales staff's service attitude was related to the relationship between state-owned commerce and the people, and to whether the state's sales plan could be completed. Therefore, they established counter service pledges to correct their service attitudes. From January 21st, a square wooden sign with the eight large characters "Patience with a hundred choices, patience with a hundred questions" was placed on each sales counter in the central store of the department store, with the name of the salesperson and their sales badge number indicated below, requiring public supervision.
    The service attitude of the vast majority of sales staff has been corrected. Bai Lϋping, a saleswoman in the underwear department who had a relatively good service attitude in the past, now regards the counter service pledge as a standard for measuring her service to the people. Once, a customer came to buy a flannel shirt, and Bai Lϋping helped him pick out one, but he thought the size was not right and suspected that the low price of the shirt meant there was a problem with the quality. At this time, Bai Lϋping measured the size for the customer to show him that the shirt fit him perfectly. He then picked up the abacus and calculated three accounts for the customer: First, the department store buys cloth in whole batches, calculated at wholesale prices, so the price is low; second, the clothes are cut in whole pieces, saving four or five inches of cloth per piece; third, unified ordering makes labor costs cheaper. Therefore, each shirt in a state-owned store is always cheaper than a customer buying cloth and sewing it themselves by several jiao, rather than being of low quality. After his careful explanation, not only did this customer buy a shirt, but the three people who came with him each bought one as well. Because he cared about customers, he received five commendations from customers in three days during the busiest time of the Spring Festival. His sales plan was also completed relatively well, exceeding the entire month's sales plan in twenty days of March.
    Ling Yu'an, a salesperson in the knitwear department who was often criticized by customers in the past, also corrected his previous impatient attitude towards customers. One day, a customer came to buy a pair of pillowcases. He took out all the patterns displayed in the counter for the customer to choose from. The customer liked a pattern for which there was only one pillowcase left. Ling Yu'an immediately brought the ladder, climbed onto the shelf to take down a few packages of pillowcases, and helped the customer choose, so that the customer selected a pair of even more beloved pillowcases. This customer praised him for truly achieving "patience with a hundred choices, patience with a hundred questions," which further encouraged his work enthusiasm.
    Now, on the "Serving the People" wall newspaper in this store, you can often see many sales staff being praised by customers: some because they patiently and repeatedly helped customers choose their favorite goods; some because the items that customers needed were not available at the central store, so they were specially transferred from other stores to sell to the customers... They care about customers, take the initiative to overcome difficulties for customers, and treat every customer with hospitality, as if they were receiving guests in their own homes.

    营业员们改善了服务态度
    张碨
    在武汉，像在别的城市一样，人们十分热爱和信赖自己的国营商店和合作社商店。但是满怀热情的顾客，常常遇到一些营业员的冷冰冰的面孔和粗暴的态度。在一次武汉市人民代表大会会议上，代表们对营业员的这种态度提出了批评，要求他们对待顾客要做到“百选不厌，百问不烦。”
    人民代表的批评，教育了武汉市的国营商业和合作社的职工们。武汉市百货公司中心门市部的营业员们进行了多次讨论，并检查了自己的服务态度。过去，有的人有一种错误想法，以为人们瞧不起营业员工作，自己若再给顾客服务好些，就会更“降低了”自己的“身份”。有的人以为：“顾客拿钱买货，我将货卖钱；他想买总得买，不想买嘛，接待再好也没用。”因此，他们对待顾客就缺乏热情，遇到一些顾客多挑选几种式样，多问几句话时，就厌烦了，有的甚至跟顾客吵起来。一些服务态度较好的营业员，也不明白为什么要“好”，怎样才算“好”，所以对待顾客也不够热情、关心。通过这次学习，他们明白了营业员必须成为一个对待顾客亲切、和蔼而又关心顾客的人。他们懂得了营业员服务态度的好坏，关系着国营商业和人民群众的关系，关系着国家销售计划能不能完成。因此，他们订立了柜台服务公约，端正服务态度。从一月二十一日起，在百货公司中心门市部的每个营业柜上，都摆上了一块塑有“百选不厌，百问不烦”八个大字的方形木牌，下边还标明了营业员的姓名和售货证章号码，要求群众监督。
    绝大部分营业员的服务态度都端正了。过去服务态度较好的内衣柜营业员白履平，现在更把柜台服务公约当作衡量自己为人民服务的标准。有一次，一个顾客来买绒衬衣，白履平帮他挑好一件，但他嫌尺码不合适，怀疑衬衣的价钱低是质量有问题。这时，白履平就量尺寸给顾客看，让他相信这件衬衣正合他身。他又随手拿起算盘给顾客算了三笔账：第一，百货公司是整批买布，按批发价计算，价钱低；第二，衣服整裁，每件要节省四、五寸布；第三，统一订制工钱便宜。因此，国营商店的每件衬衣总要比顾客买布缝制便宜好几角钱，而不是质量低。经他这样细心解释后，不仅这个顾客买了一件衬衣，连同他来的三个人也各买了一件。由于他关心顾客，所以在春节期间营业最繁忙的时候，他三天中便受到了顾客的五次表扬。他的销售计划也完成得比较好，三月份二十天便超额完成了全月的销售计划。
    过去经常受到顾客批评的针织柜营业员凌玉安也纠正了以往对待顾客的烦躁态度。一天，有位顾客来买一对枕巾，他把摆在柜里的花样都拿出来给顾客挑，这位顾客看中的一种花样的枕巾，只剩下一条了。凌玉安马上把梯子搬来，爬到货架上取下几包枕巾，帮顾客挑选，使顾客选到了一对更喜爱的枕巾。这个顾客表扬他真正做到了“百选不厌，百问不烦”，因而更鼓舞了他的工作热情。
    现在，在这个门市部的“为人民服务”的墙报上，可以常常看到很多营业员受到顾客的表扬：有的是因为耐心地反复帮助顾客挑选到了心爱的货物；有的是因为顾客所需要的东西中心门市部没有，专门到其他门市部拨来卖给顾客……。他们关心顾客，主动为顾客克服困难，并且像接待自己家里的客人一样，殷勤招待着每一个顾客。
