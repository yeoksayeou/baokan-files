　　The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and its branches throughout the country are preparing to increase the total value of medicines supplied to rural areas this year by 60 percent compared to last year. Since January this year, the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation's Chongqing Purchasing and Supply Station has shipped more than twice as many prepared medicines to Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces compared to the first quarter of last year. The variety has also increased from 93 types last year to 122 types. These medicines are sold to farmers through local supply and marketing cooperatives and department stores. Currently, there are more than 13,800 grassroots cooperatives and department stores nationwide that handle prepared medicines, offering one to two hundred varieties. There are more than 5,000 trained salespersons who are familiar with the properties of prepared medicines. They have created many methods to facilitate farmers' purchase of medicines. In the border areas of Yunnan Province, salespersons of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives package commonly used medicines (ten-odd types), along with medical cotton and gauze, into boxes and sell them with attached instructions for use, which are very popular among farmers. Many areas also employ methods such as "carrying medicines to the countryside, delivering goods to the door, and providing on-the-spot instruction" for sales.

    医药公司供应农村药品增加
    中国医药公司各地分、支公司今年准备供应农村的药品总值将比去年增加百分之六十。今年一月份以来，中国医药公司重庆采购供应站运到四川、云南、贵州、西康等省的成药，比去年第一季度增加了一倍多，品种也由去年的九十三种增加到一百二十二种。这些药品都经过当地的供销合作社和百货商店销售给农民。目前全国经营成药的基层合作社和百货商店有一万三千八百多个，经营品种有一、二百种。经过训练能够熟悉成药性能的营业员已有五千多名。他们创造了很多便利农民购买药物的办法，云南省边疆地区国营商业和合作社的营业员把普通常用的十几种药品和药棉、纱布分装成盒，并附带药品用途说明书出售，很受农民欢迎。很多地区还采用“背药下乡、送货上门、就地传授”的方法销售。　　　　　　（新华社）
