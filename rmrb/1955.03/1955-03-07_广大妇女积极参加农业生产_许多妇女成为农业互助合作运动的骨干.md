    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Women in many regions across the country are actively participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and agricultural production, and have become an important force on the agricultural production front. According to statistics from Rehe Province in 1954, over 90 percent of the female labor force in the province could participate in agricultural and other production year-round. In Xinjiang Province, over 70 percent of women of all ethnic groups in vast agricultural areas participated in agricultural production. Women also account for a large proportion of participants in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In many agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province, women members who regularly participate in production account for over 50 percent. In the more than 42,000 agricultural production cooperatives already established in Henan Province, over 45 percent are women members. In mutual aid and cooperative organizations, many women have been elected as leaders of societies or groups. According to statistics from 4,131 agricultural production cooperatives in 57 counties and 10 suburban districts in Jiangsu Province, 421 women hold positions as chairpersons or vice-chairpersons, and 3,170 serve as committee members. In the 123 old cooperatives established in Lushan County, Henan Province, before the autumn harvest of 1954, each cooperative had a female chairperson or vice-chairperson. In 1954, various localities in Rehe Province cultivated more than 6,480 female backbone members in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In Yunnan Province's mutual aid and cooperative organizations, more than 20,000 women of various ethnic groups are chairpersons or skilled producers.

    Women participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations have actively leveraged their strengths in production. In agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province, a major cotton and tobacco producing area in China, the technical management of cotton and tobacco leaves has been basically taken over by women. Subsidiary occupations such as raising chickens and pigs in the cooperatives are also mostly managed by women members. In the agricultural production cooperative led by the famous labor model Xin Zixiu, the income from subsidiary occupations such as raising chickens and pigs by the women members reached more than 200 million yuan (old currency) in 1954. In the mountainous areas of Rehe Province, activities such as collecting medicinal herbs and raising silkworms are also mainly undertaken by women. Last year, women in seven counties including Xinglong and Fengning earned 1.1477 billion yuan (old currency) from activities such as pig farming and medicinal herb collection alone. In many regions, women in mutual aid and cooperative organizations also undertake heavier agricultural labor within their capabilities. In the mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Tianbao Township, Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, 402 women are capable of plowing, harrowing, carrying loads, operating waterwheels, and pushing carts. The female members of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Turpan, Xinjiang Province, have learned more than 26 kinds of labor skills.

    All localities are concerned about women's participation in agricultural production and pay attention to helping them solve difficulties in production. Since last winter, counties in Rehe Province have universally held technical training classes to train women in various production techniques. More than 2,100 female technicians in agriculture and animal husbandry have been trained in more than a dozen counties including Luanping, Chengde, and Qinglong alone. Over 400 seasonal nurseries have also been established in 12 counties including Chengde and Pingquan in Rehe Province to solve the difficulty of female members being unable to produce due to having children. Women in mutual aid and cooperative organizations are able to unite in production. In order to complete the task of increasing grain production for the entire cooperative, the Tujia women of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shidong Township, Wenshan County, Yunnan Province, helped the Miao women learn how to plow fields and transplant rice seedlings.

    Many agricultural production cooperatives implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. The labor income of female members is not less than that of male members, and the income of some female members increases year by year. At the same time, because of their active production and enthusiasm for building cooperatives, many women have been elected as labor models or model chairpersons. This has gradually changed some male farmers' views of belittling women's labor and improved family relationships.

    广大妇女积极参加农业生产
    许多妇女成为农业互助合作运动的骨干
    【新华社六日讯】全国许多地区的妇女积极参加互助合作组织和农业生产，并已成为农业生产战线上的重要力量。据热河省一九五四年的统计，全省百分之九十以上的妇女劳动力都能常年参加农业生产和其他生产。新疆省广大农业地区的各族妇女参加农业生产的占百分之七十以上。在互助合作组织中，妇女参加生产的也占很大比重。山东省许多农业生产合作社的女社员常年参加生产的占百分之五十以上。河南省已经建成的四万二千多个农业生产合作社里，百分之四十五以上是女社员。在互助合作组织中，许多妇女被选为社或组的领导人。据江苏省五十七个县和十个市郊区的四千一百三十一个农业生产合作社的统计，妇女担任社长、副社长的有四百二十一人，担任社务委员的有三千一百七十人。河南省鲁山县一九五四年秋收前建成的一百二十三个老社中，每个社都有女社长或副社长。一九五四年，热河省各地共培养出六千四百八十多名互助合作组织中的妇女骨干分子。云南省互助合作组织中，有两万多个各族妇女是社长或生产能手。
    参加互助合作组织的妇女在生产中都积极发挥了妇女的特长。我国主要的棉烟产区河南省的农业生产合作社里，棉花和烟叶的技术管理工作，已经基本上全部由妇女去做。社里养鸡、喂猪等副业也大都是由女社员经营的。著名劳动模范辛自修领导的农业生产合作社里，女社员们在一九五四年养鸡、喂猪的副业收入就达两亿多元（旧币）。热河省山区的采药、养蚕等项生产主要也由妇女去做。去年兴隆、丰宁等七个县的妇女仅从养猪、采药等项生产中就收入十一亿四千七百多万元（旧币）。许多地区的妇女在互助合作组织中，还担任了她们力所能及的较重的农业劳动。江苏省如皋县天堡乡的互助合作组织中，有四百零二个妇女都能进行耕田、耙地、挑担、车水和推车。新疆省吐鲁番五星农业生产合作社的女社员共学会二十六种以上的劳动技术。
    各地对妇女参加农业生产都很关心，注意帮助她们解决生产上的困难问题。热河省各县去冬以来，普遍举办技术训练班，培养妇女学习各项生产技术。仅滦平、承德、青龙等十多个县即已训练出二千一百多名农业和畜牧业的女技术员。热河省承德、平泉等十二个县还建立了四百多个农忙托儿组织，解决了女社员因有孩子不能生产的困难。互助合作组织中妇女之间都能团结生产。云南省文山县石硐乡红旗农业生产合作社的土族妇女为完成全社粮食增产任务，帮助苗族妇女学会了犁田栽秧。
    许多农业生产合作社里都是实行男女同酬的原则。女社员的劳动收入并不比男社员少，有些女社员的收入一年比一年增加。同时，由于她们积极生产，热心建社，许多妇女被选为劳动模范或模范社长。这样就逐渐改变有些男农民轻视妇女劳动的观点，并改善了家庭关系。
