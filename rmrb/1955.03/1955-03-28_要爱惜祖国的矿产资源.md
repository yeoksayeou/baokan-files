    Cherish the Motherland's Mineral Resources

    In many coal mines, there is still a long-standing habit of waste. They do not clean up and recycle the loose coal scattered on the coal mining faces, allowing it to be discarded. The reason given is: "You have to drop some grains of rice when you eat, don't you? The mine is full of coal everywhere, so what does it matter if a little bit is scattered on the ground!"
    This "little bit" is not an insignificant number. According to incomplete statistics, the Benxi Coal Mine lost more than 21,000 tons of coal in empty roadways and on the top and bottom plates last year alone. The Fushun Mining Bureau's Laohutai Mine lost more than 98,000 tons of coal last year for the same reason. This amount of coal could fill more than 3,260 trains, equivalent to the annual output of a small coal mine. In several mines of the Kailuan Coal Mine, this phenomenon of coal loss is also very serious. In some raw coal seam working faces, the loose coal is piled up to one or two feet high, making it difficult to walk. In the end, it is buried in the old pits along with the rocks.
    This loose coal, when left in the roadways, not only causes material losses but is also the root of many disasters. In some roadways, the loose coal is piled up too thickly, and when propping, the pillars have to be placed on the loose coal. The foundation is not solid, and as a result, the rocks above collapse, causing roof fall accidents. Over time, some loose coal spontaneously combusts and causes fires underground. Last year, the Fushun Laohutai Mine had seven underground spontaneous combustion incidents, six of which were caused by the spontaneous combustion of residual coal left in the roadways.
    Some coal mine workers say: "To save, you must first focus on the big picture. It is both troublesome and time-consuming to clean up the loose coal bit by bit, and it won't solve the problem." This argument also does not stand up to scrutiny. The fact is that cleaning up and recycling loose coal is neither troublesome nor time-consuming, but it can solve big problems. For example, when the employees of the Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhaogezhuang Mine's 7191 working face held a meeting in early February to check why the production task was not being completed well, they found that too much loose coal was being lost on this working face. On a working face 50 meters long, loose coal two feet thick was often lost, which affected the completion of the production task. From February 15th, workers in three shifts launched a competition to clean up the loose coal. The workers cleaned up the coal on the edge of the old pit and under the chutes. As a result, the output rose sharply, and the output of raw coal increased by 1,400 tons in thirteen days. The workers said: "Cleaning up loose coal does not cost anything. As long as everyone is diligent and shovels two more shovels, dozens or hundreds of tons of coal will come out. The country's wealth is increased, and our income is increased." It can be seen that cleaning up loose coal is not a difficult task.
    In the past, imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism carried out predatory exploitation of our country's mineral resources. They dug, mined, and discarded everywhere in the mines, damaging many coal mine resources and leaving behind serious fires. However, today the people are already the masters of state-owned mines. The coalfields stretching under the motherland are the common wealth of all our people and future generations. We have no right to waste them arbitrarily. The old "habit" of not cherishing underground resources brought from the old era should be thoroughly eliminated.

### 要爱惜祖国的矿产资源

    要爱惜祖国的矿产资源
    孔桑
    有许多煤矿，至今仍存在着一种由来已久的浪费习惯。他们不打扫和回收铺满采煤工作面上的浮煤，任其丢弃。理由是：“吃饭也得掉些饭粒?，矿井下边四面八方都是煤，还在乎这撒在地下的一点点！”
    这“一点点”并非是一个不足道的数字。据不完全的统计，本溪煤矿去年一年，在空巷子和顶底板里丢掉的煤，即达二万一千多吨。抚顺矿务局老虎台矿去年因为同样的原因，丢煤达九万八千多吨。这些煤可以装三千二百六十多辆火车，等于一个小煤矿一年的产量。在开滦煤矿的几个矿井里，这种丢煤的现象也很严重，有的原煤层工作面上，浮煤竟堆得一、二尺高，路也不好走，最后都和岩石一起埋进了老塘里。
    这些浮煤被丢在巷子里，不但造成物质损失，而且还是许多祸害的根源。有的巷子里浮煤堆得太厚，支柱的时候只好把柱子打在浮煤上，根底不结实，结果上边的岩石压下来，就酿成冒顶事故。有的浮煤天长日久，就自然发火燃烧，在井下引起火灾。去年抚顺老虎台矿井下七次自然发火，有六次就是因为留在巷子里的残煤自燃而引起的。
    有些煤矿工作人员说：“要节约先得从大处着眼，星星点点地打扫点浮煤，既麻烦费事，又解决不了问题。”这种论调，也是不经一驳的。事实是打扫回收浮煤，既不麻烦费事，却能解决大问题，例如开滦煤矿赵各庄矿七一九一工作面的职工二月初开会检查为什么生产任务完成得不好时，发现原来这个工作面上浮煤丢得太多，五十公尺长的工作面上，经常要丢掉二尺厚的浮煤，以致影响了产量任务的完成。二月十五日起，三个班的工人展开了打扫浮煤的竞赛，工人们把老塘边上、溜子底下的煤都打扫得干干净净，结果产量就直线上升，十三天中就增产了原煤一千四百吨。工人们说：“打扫浮煤不用花什么本钱，只要大家手勤，每人多铲两锹，几十吨、几百吨煤就出来了，国家增加了财富，我们增加了收入。”可见打扫浮煤并不是一件很难的事。
    过去帝国主义和官僚资本主义，对我国矿山资源实行掠夺性的开采，他们在矿井底下到处乱挖、乱采、乱丢，弄得许多煤矿资源受到破坏，并且留下了严重的火灾。但是，今天人民已经是国营矿山的主人，绵延在祖国地下的煤田，是我们全体人民和后代子孙的共同财富，我们没有权利随意地加以浪费。从旧时代带来的那种不爱惜地下资源的旧“习惯”，是应当彻底地加以肃清了。
