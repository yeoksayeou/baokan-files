What is American "Freedom"?
Cui Qi

The American aggressor clique is busy finding a so-called "moral" basis for its aggressive acts of occupying Taiwan and subverting the People's Republic of China. On February 23, the United States Information Service reported that American officials in Washington described the forced removal of Dachen Island residents to Taiwan under the terroristic threats of the U.S. military and Chiang Kai-shek troops as "almost a unanimous choice" of their own, and that they were "unwilling to live under Communist rule." These officials also mentioned the incident of more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war being abducted to Taiwan by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek after the Korean armistice, attempting to prove that "Chinese people would oppose Communism if they had the opportunity."

However, who doesn't know how the "almost unanimous" "choice" of the residents of Dachen Island was made? The Associated Press once reported that the American "Naval Demolition Team" carried out frenzied acts of destruction on Dachen Island, turning the place where the people of Dachen Island had lived for generations into a scorched earth and rubble. "Hundreds of fires are burning... presenting a scene of hell." Liu Lianyi, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Dachen Island, told an Associated Press reporter before fleeing, "When we leave, only dead people will be left on the island." According to this policy, Chiang Kai-shek troops forced the residents of Dachen to board the star-spangled warships with bayonets. Residents who were unwilling to go were shot. The blood of the victims was spilled on the square, and the corpses were buried along the communication trenches all the way to the sea....

That's the fact. The so-called "almost unanimous" "choice" of the residents of Dachen Island was not made by the people of Dachen Island themselves, but by the explosives of the American "Naval Demolition Team" and the machine guns and bayonets supplied by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek troops. It is not that "Chinese people would oppose Communism if they had the opportunity," but that the United States seizes every opportunity to rob the Chinese people. Today's American ruling clique not only plunders the land and resources of others everywhere, but has also degenerated to the point where they have returned to the slave era, making large-scale population looting their business.

The incident of more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war being abducted to Taiwan, which was mentioned by American officials, is the same example. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which was responsible for guarding the prisoners of war, clearly pointed out in its "Interim Report" and "Final Report" that American, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee's agents controlled the entire prisoner-of-war camps, using massacre, tattooing, and torture to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. Finally, the United States brazenly disregarded the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not to release the prisoners of war, abducted the prisoners of war to Taiwan, and incorporated them into the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

In Vietnam, after the Geneva Conference, the United States dispatched the Navy and Air Force, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's agents, and abducted more than 12,000 overseas Chinese who had lived in North Vietnam for centuries.

Now, the same unprecedented tragedy has occurred in the Nanji Islands. The residents of these small islands have also been all escorted to Taiwan.

The American aggressor clique, with such a loss of conscience and extinction of humanity, looting the population of entire regions, is entirely for the preparation of war. In the eyes of the United States, those who have been robbed, because they are displaced and homeless, are the easiest to be forced to serve as cheap cannon fodder. According to the Associated Press, Washington authorities openly stated on February 14 that the Chiang Kai-shek troops "are valuable weapons not only for defending Taiwan, but also for possible other uses in the Far East." It can be seen that the United States is robbing people everywhere to expand the Chiang Kai-shek troops, in an attempt to prevent our people from liberating our territory of Taiwan and to prepare for a new war.

However, the Chinese people have seen through the vicious intentions of the American aggressor clique. The Chinese people love their motherland and their people's regime. American cannons and bayonets cannot thwart their will. Even if the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique used all kinds of bloody and terrifying means against the residents of Dachen Island, there were still dozens of people from Dachen Island who were willing to die rather than go to Taiwan. They are now living witnesses to the atrocities of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. Even if the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents set up a dragnet in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp in Korea, there were still more than 600 captured personnel from Korea and China who risked their lives to climb over the barbed wire and escape. They exposed the entire conspiracy of the United States to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Even if the United States attempts to portray Taiwan as a "paradise" of "democracy and freedom," it was precisely on this day that U.S. officials were slanderously defaming the Chinese people that Chiang Kai-shek air force personnel Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong risked their lives to fly and defect, returning to the mainland of the motherland. It can be predicted that the people of Dachen Island and Nanji Island who were abducted to Taiwan, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were forcibly detained in Korea, will never stop their struggle to return to their beloved homeland.

Dulles said sickeningly at the Bangkok Conference on February 23 that one of the basic premises of American foreign policy is to give others so-called "freedom." But what exactly is the "freedom" he is talking about? The tragedies staged in Korea, Dachen Island, and Nanji Island prove: the "freedom" to be a slave – that is the "freedom" that the United States wants to give to others!

### 美国的“自由”是什么

    美国的“自由”是什么
    崔奇
    美国侵略集团正忙于为它侵占台湾、颠覆中华人民共和国的侵略行为寻找所谓“道义上”的根据。二月二十三日，美国新闻处报道说，华盛顿的美国官员把大陈岛居民在美军和蒋贼军的恐怖威胁下被劫往台湾，说成是他们自己“几乎一致选择”的，是他们“不愿生活在共产党统治下”。这些官员并提到朝鲜停战后一万四千多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美蒋劫往台湾的事件，企图证明“中国人如有机会就会反对共产主义”。
    但是，谁不知道大陈岛的居民的“几乎一致”的“选择”是怎么作出的呢？合众社曾经报道说，美国“海军爆破组”在大陈岛上进行了疯狂的破坏工作，把大陈岛人民世世代代居住的地方变成了一片焦土和瓦砾。“成百处火焰燃烧着……呈现一片地狱景象”。大陈蒋贼军的头子刘廉一在逃走以前曾经对合众社记者说，“当我们离开时，岛上将只剩下死人”。按照这样的方针，蒋贼军用刺刀逼着大陈居民走上那挂着星条旗的军舰。不愿意走的居民们遭到枪杀。被害者的鲜血洒在广场上，尸体沿着交通沟一直埋到海边……。
  　事实就是这样，大陈岛居民的所谓“几乎一致”的“选择”，并不是大陈岛人民自己作出的，而是美国“海军爆破组”的炸药和美国供应给蒋贼军的机关枪和刺刀代他们作出的。并不是什么“中国人如有机会就会反对共产主义”，而是美国一有机会就要抢劫中国人。今天的美国统治集团不仅到处掠夺别人的土地和资源，而且已经堕落到这样地步，他们竟回复到奴隶时代，以大规模的劫掠人口为能事了。
    美国官员们所提到的一万四千多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被劫往台湾的事件，就是同样的例子。负责看管战俘的中立国遣返委员会在它的“临时报告”和“最后报告”中清楚地指出，美国和蒋介石、李承晚的特务控制了整个战俘营，用屠杀、刺字和酷刑来阻挠战俘遣返。最后美国又悍然不顾中立国遣返委员会关于不得释放战俘的决定，将战俘劫往台湾，并且把他们编入了蒋贼军。
    在越南，美国在日内瓦会议以后出动海军和空军，伙同蒋贼特务，劫走了几世纪以来就居住在北越的一万二千多名华侨。
    现在，同样的旷古未闻的惨剧又在南麂山列岛发生了。这些小岛上的居民也被全部押解到了台湾。
    美国侵略集团这样丧尽天良、灭绝人性，劫掠整个地区的人口，完全是为了准备战争。在美国看来，那些被劫走的人，由于流离失所，无家可归，是最便于强迫他们充当廉价的炮灰的。据合众社报道，华盛顿权威人士在二月十四日公开说：蒋贼军“不但对于保卫台湾，而且对于远东可能的其他用途都是有价值的武器”。由此可见，美国到处抢人来扩充蒋贼军，是企图阻止我国人民解放我国领土台湾，并进行新战争的准备。
    但是，中国人民是看透了美国侵略集团这种狠毒的心肠的。中国人民热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的人民政权。美国的大炮和刺刀挫折不了他们的意志。即使美国和蒋介石卖国集团对大陈岛居民用尽了各种血腥恐怖的手段，还是有几十名大陈岛的人民宁死也不愿意到台湾去。他们现在成了美蒋暴行的活生生的证人。即使美蒋特务在朝鲜的东场里战俘营中布下了天罗地网，仍然有六百多名朝中被俘人员冒死爬铁丝网逃了出来。他们揭露了美国强迫扣留战俘的全部阴谋。即使美国企图把台湾说成是什么“民主自由”的“乐土”，但是恰恰就在美国官员信口诽谤中国人民的这一天，蒋贼军空军人员刘若龙和宋宝荣冒着生命危险驾驶飞机起义，返回了祖国大陆。可以预料，被劫到台湾去的大陈岛、南麂山岛的人民，和在朝鲜被强迫扣留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，决不会停止他们要求回到他们可爱的家园的斗争。
    杜勒斯二月二十三日在曼谷会议上令人欲呕地说，美国外交政策的基本前提之一，就是要使别人也得到所谓“自由”。可是他所说的“自由”究竟是什么呢？在朝鲜、大陈岛和南麂山岛演出的惨剧证明：做奴隶的“自由”——这就是美国要使别人得到的“自由”！
