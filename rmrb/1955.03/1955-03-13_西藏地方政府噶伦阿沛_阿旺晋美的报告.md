    Report by Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme of the Tibetan Local Government
    (Approved at the 7th Plenary Session of the State Council on March 9, 1955)
    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the glorious illumination of the great ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I am infinitely honored and pleased to have the opportunity today to report briefly on the situation in Tibet on behalf of the Tibetan Local Government, as ordered by the Dalai Lama, at the Plenary Session of the State Council.
    The relationship between the Han and Tibetan brotherly ethnic groups has been formed for over 1,300 years. During the reigns of past dynasties, there were times of close harmony and occasional conflicts. However, inseparable historical relationships were formed in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. All of the above is clearly recorded in historical books. During the reign of the Manchu emperors, the oppression of Tibet gradually deepened. They used fraudulent means to deprive Tibet of its political, economic, and cultural rights, cruelly oppressing and exploiting the Tibetan people. When foreign imperialists successively invaded, the Manchu government was unable to resist foreign aggression. Under these circumstances, the Tibetan people had no choice but to rise up and expel them. Subsequently, the reactionary Kuomintang government adopted methods similar to those used to suppress other minority ethnic groups to suppress the Tibetan people. When there was no opportunity to exploit, they deceitfully colluded with reactionary warlords in areas near Tibet, constantly launching military offensives. On the other hand, they used a policy of appeasement, establishing an office in Lhasa and dispatching a large number of secret agents to provoke ethnic relations and create internal disputes in Tibet, supplying weapons to some groups in Tibet to build up armed forces, and carrying out various conspiracies. At this time, foreign imperialists also took the opportunity to invade Tibet, using honeyed words and hidden daggers,妄想 (妄想: vainly attempting) to gradually seize sovereignty over Tibetan politics, economy, culture, etc. In order to enslave the Tibetan people, they implemented a divisive ethnic policy under the guise of "independence and autonomy," using the excuse of helping the Tibetan government to supply large quantities of weapons. Under such dual violence, both internal and external, the Tibetan people were in a very dangerous situation. Due to the low political awareness of the Tibetan people, they did not recognize these conspiracies. Just as the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party was about to achieve victory, the imperialists intensified their provocations and rumors. The Tibetan people already had a fear of the Han people, and coupled with believing the enemy's counter-propaganda against the Communist Party's policies, they developed undue suspicion. Later, due to the great and correct ethnic policies of Chairman Mao, the Tibetan Local Government responded to the call for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and sent representatives to prepare to travel to Beijing via India. However, while en route abroad, they encountered rumors, provocations, and numerous difficulties, preventing them from reaching the motherland. Later, after the Dalai Lama, the political and religious leader of Tibet, took charge, he immediately sent representatives via Chamdo and India to the capital of the motherland and signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. From then on, the Tibetan people were forever freed from the oppression and conspiracies of internal and external reactionaries, achieved complete liberation, returned to the big family of the motherland, fully enjoyed equal ethnic rights, and the relations between all brotherly ethnic groups, especially the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, were completely changed, forming new friendly relations.
    General Zhang Jingwu, the Central Representative, and Commander Zhang Guohua led the People's Liberation Army and working personnel entering Tibet, following the instructions of the Central People's Government and in accordance with the spirit of ethnic policies and the Seventeen-Article Agreement. They showed great respect for Tibet's original political system, the original status of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the religious beliefs, customs, and habits of the Tibetan people, and protected the Lama temples. In terms of economic development, People's Banks and trade companies were established in Lhasa and major cities, agricultural and pastoral experimental farms were set up, interest-free loans were issued to farmers, and low-interest loans were issued to handicraftsmen and merchants to help develop production and purchase Tibetan wool that had been stockpiled in the past due to suppressed prices and blockades by imperialists at reasonable prices. In addition, in the past, Tibet needed to purchase all goods from India, but due to the fluctuating value of Indian currency, Tibet's economy suffered greatly. Since the establishment of the People's Bank, the stabilization of finance has greatly benefited trade in goods.
    In terms of culture, education, and health, People's Hospitals were first established in various places to provide free treatment for all diseases of the Tibetan people and prevent epidemics, which played a significant role in increasing the population of our ethnic group. Secondly, primary schools, cadre schools, political study classes, patriotic youth cultural associations, patriotic women's associations, etc., were established, and Tibetan newspapers and Tibetan-language broadcasts were created, developing the Tibetan language and culture and laying the foundation for training cadres, enabling the Tibetan people to understand the domestic and international situation. Regarding the relationship between our Tibet region and India, new relationships were established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in accordance with the five principles of our foreign policy. The results of the above major measures have greatly developed the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Tibetan people, laying a foundation for prosperity. There is no end to the benefits mentioned above.
    In particular, the recently completed Kangzang and Qingzang highways are absolutely essential for consolidating national defense, building Tibet from a transportation-difficult and production-backward region into a brand-new Tibet, and strengthening the connection between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland. This is the source of happiness for our Tibetan people. It has been completed well in just over three years, laying a good foundation for the development and construction of Tibet.
    The above construction work has been carried out after consultation with Tibetan leaders and the people and with their consent, and no coercion has ever occurred. However, due to the influence of remnants of old habits, the officials and monks and laypeople of our Tibetan Local Government sometimes believe that discussions are merely formalities and dare not express their opinions, or fear that their opinions will not be firmly implemented. Therefore, they do not see a favorable long-term vision for Tibet in terms of construction, and they are not active and enthusiastic enough in creating various conditions, so they have not achieved great and good results. Due to the consistent implementation of the great ethnic equality and ethnic unity policies by the People's Liberation Army and all cadres, the majority of the Tibetan people have gradually eliminated the old wounds caused by the oppression and exploitation of past rulers, exposed the deceptive schemes of foreign imperialists' provocations and rumors, strengthened the unity between brotherly ethnic groups, especially the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and the unity within the Tibetan ethnic group has been developed and improved. They clearly recognize that the Han people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are fundamentally different from the reactionary elements of the Kuomintang in the past. The basic situation is generally good as reported above, but some shortcomings and errors are inevitable. Individual cadres and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, due to their lack of understanding of customs and language, have made some minor shortcomings and errors in trade and transportation in individual regions, but they have been immediately corrected and the shortcomings have been overcome, so national unity and other aspects have not been greatly affected. These are some simple past situations.
    Due to the aforementioned major achievements in the past, unprecedented friendly unity has emerged between all brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups. Under the leadership of the Tibetan people's leaders, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, nearly a thousand members of the visiting group and trainees gathered in the capital of the motherland, Beijing, and were especially honored to meet Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups. This is a concrete manifestation of the unprecedented great unity of the great motherland. Headed by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, Tibetan representatives attended the first session of the First National People's Congress, and on the basis of equality regardless of the size of ethnic groups, they discussed and formulated the national constitution, elected the chairman and leading cadres of the state organs, and obtained political equality. In particular, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, in order to establish a unified Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, including the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kampot会议厅 (Kanting) Committee, and the Chamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, a preparatory group was specially formed. Now, the consensus report of everyone, the plan submitted by the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Kampot会议厅 Committee to the State Council for assistance, the report on the discord and unresolved issues that have existed between the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Kampot会议厅 Committee in the past, which have now been completely resolved on the basis of new friendship and on the principle of willingness, due to instructions and assistance, and the report requesting annual subsidies to the Tibetan government to help Tibet exchange banknotes and help reorganize the Tibetan army have been submitted to the State Council successively. All of this fully proves our trust in the correct ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao. We hope that at this State Council meeting, decisions will be made after discussion, research, and revision, and we hope to receive assistance and care from all parties. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, our Tibetan monks and laypeople warmly support the formulation of our country's constitution, heighten vigilance and oppose the rumors and provocations of foreign imperialism, enhance patriotic ideology, strengthen and develop the unity between all brotherly ethnic groups, especially the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and the unity within the Tibetan people, so as to create conditions for the rapid and formal establishment of local autonomous organs in Tibet. In the past, the People's Liberation Army and cadres entering Tibet gave many beneficial assistance to the Tibetan people. On this basis, we must further rely on the assistance of the State Council and the Han cadres and Han people entering Tibet to strive to develop Tibet's political, economic, cultural, educational, and other undertakings, build a happy and prosperous new Tibet, and fully enjoy the rights of being masters of our own affairs. Because our Tibetan people have been backward for a long time, with weak cultural knowledge and modern political experience, shortcomings and errors have occurred in our past work. Today, with the selfless assistance of the central government, in the good era under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan people, who were originally in the abyss of oppression, backwardness, and poverty, can now raise their heads and confidently move towards a path of prosperity and happiness. However, because the work being carried out is all new, some shortcomings and errors may unknowingly occur. The comrades who have come to Tibet to provide assistance have worked very hard. We are very clear about this great kindness. In the future, we hope that for all aspects of work, like family members, we can be unreservedly and patiently criticized, instructed, and helped with ease and kindness, just as teachers teach students. Because Tibet does not yet have national cadres with scientific knowledge, in addition to hoping that Tibetan cadres will be vigorously cultivated in various parts of Tibet and in the Central Nationalities Institute, a large number of Han cadres are also needed to help with various construction projects. The transportation in the southern and northern parts of our former and latter Tibet is very inconvenient, and people and animals suffer greatly. We hope that this will be gradually improved. After we return to Tibet, we will submit requests for assistance in all aspects at any time based on the actual situation in the course of our work.

    西藏地方政府噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美的报告
    （一九五五年三月九日　国务院全体会议第七次会议批准）
    自从西藏和平解放以来，在中国共产党、毛主席的伟大民族政策的光辉照耀下，今天我能有机会在国务院全体会议上奉达赖喇嘛命代表西藏地方政府简要地将西藏地方情况报告一下，感觉到无限光荣和愉快。
    汉藏兄弟民族关系的形成已有一千三百多年了，在历代皇朝统治时期，有时是亲密和好，间或也发生过彼此之间的冲突，但在政治、经济、文化等各方面都形成了不可分离的历史关系。所有以上一切都清楚地记载在历史书籍中。到了满清皇帝统治时期，对西藏的压迫，日渐加深，并以诈骗的手段，剥夺了西藏的政治、经济、文化等权利，残酷地压迫和剥削西藏人民，在外国帝国主义相继侵入时，满清政府又不能抵御外侮，在这种情况下，西藏人民不得不起来反抗，将它驱逐。随后国民党反动政府采取如镇压其他少数民族一样办法镇压西藏人民，当无机可乘时，一方面奸诈地勾结临近西藏地区的反动军阀，不断地制造军事进攻；一方面又用羁糜政策，在拉萨成立办事处，派遣大批密探，挑拨民族关系，为制造西藏内部的纠纷，进行各种阴谋诡计，给西藏的一些集团供给武器，建立武装。此时，外国帝国主义也乘机侵入西藏，以口蜜腹剑的手段，妄想逐步掌握在藏的政治、经济、文化等主权，他们为了奴役西藏人民以“独立自主”的名义实行挑拨离间的民族分裂政策，借口帮助西藏政府，供给大批武器。就在这样内外双重暴力政策之下，使西藏人民处于非常危险的境地。由于西藏人民政治觉悟低，没有认清那些阴谋诡计，正当中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命快要取得胜利的时候，帝国主义更变本加厉地挑拨和造谣。西藏人民对汉人原有恐惧心理，再加上听信了敌人对共产党政策的反宣传，因而产生了不应有的怀疑。后来，由于毛主席伟大正确的民族政策的感召，西藏地方政府响应了和平解放西藏的号召，派遣代表准备取道印度来京。但途经国外时，遇到造谣挑拨和重重留难，不能来到祖国。以后由西藏政教领袖达赖喇嘛亲政以后，立即派代表分途由昌都和印度两道来到祖国首都，签订了西藏和平解放办法协议十七条，从此西藏人民永远摆脱了内外反动派的压迫和阴谋诡计，获得彻底的解放，回到了祖国大家庭内，充分享受到了民族平等权利，各兄弟民族间特别是汉藏民族间的关系得到了彻底的改变，结成了新的友谊关系。
    中央代表张经武将军和张国华司令员领导进藏人民解放军及工作人员遵照中央人民政府的指示，根据民族政策及十七条协议的精神，对西藏原有的政治制度、达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼原有的地位，以及西藏人民的宗教信仰与风俗习惯，都极为尊重，并保护喇嘛寺院。在发展经济方面，拉萨及各大城市成立了人民银行和贸易公司，设立农牧业的实验场，对农民发放无利息的贷款，对手工业者及商人发放低利的贷款，帮助发展生产并以合理价格收购了过去遭受帝国主义压低价格和封锁下所积压的西藏羊毛。此外，西藏过去所需物品全由印度购进，但由于过去印币涨跌不定的影响，使西藏经济遭受到莫大的损失。自成立人民银行以后，由于稳定了金融，买卖商品方面得到了很大的好处。
    在文教卫生方面，首先在各地设立了人民医院，免费治疗西藏人民的一切疾病，并预防疫病，对增加本民族的人口起了显著的作用。其次设立了小学、干部学校、政治学习班、爱国青年文化联谊会、爱国妇女联谊会等，创办藏文报纸和藏语广播，发展了西藏语文及文化，奠立了培养干部的基础，使藏民了解了国内外的情况。在我国西藏地方和印度间的关系方面，根据我国外交政策的五项原则，双方在平等互利的基础上建立了新的关系。以上各项重大措施的结果，使西藏人民的政治、经济、文化各方面都得到了很大的发展，打下了繁荣的基础。以上种种好处是说不完的。
    尤其最近修筑完成的康藏、青藏两条公路，对于巩固祖国的国防、把交通困难生产落后的西藏建设成一个崭新的西藏，以及加强西藏与祖国内地的联系都是绝对不能缺少的，这是我们西藏人民幸福的源泉。现在在仅仅三年多的短时间内就很好地完成了，给西藏的发展建设打下了良好的基础。
    以上各项建设工作都是经过与西藏领袖人物及人民进行商议，取得同意才去实行，从未发生过任何强迫情形。但我们西藏地方政府的官员和僧俗人民起初由于受了旧习惯的残余影响，在开始进行工作时，有时认为进行讨论仅仅是形式的，不敢发表意见，或怕发表了意见不会坚决实行，因此，在建设方面既看不到有利于西藏的远景，在各种条件的创造方面亦不够积极和热诚，所以没有收到很大很好的效果。由于人民解放军和全体干部一贯地执行了民族平等和民族团结的伟大民族政策，西藏大多数人民逐渐消除了过去历代统治者的压迫剥削所造成的旧有的创伤，揭穿了外国帝国主义者挑拨造谣的骗局，加强了兄弟民族间的团结，尤其是汉藏两族间和藏族内部的团结有了发展和改善，清楚地认识到了在共产党和毛主席领导下的汉族人民和从前国民党的反动分子是根本不同的。基本情况正如上面所报告的那样一般是良好的，但也不免要发生一些缺点和错误，有个别干部和人民解放军官兵由于不懂风俗习惯和不通语言，在个别地区贸易和运输方面发生了一些小的缺点和错误，但立刻纠正过来了，并将缺点克服了，因此在民族团结等方面没有受到很大的影响。这是过去的一些简单情况。
    由于上述的过去的那些重大成就，祖国的各兄弟民族间特别是汉藏民族间出现了历史上未曾有过的友好团结，在西藏人民的领袖达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的领导下，将近千人的参观团人员和学员齐集在祖国首都北京，特别荣幸地见到了各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席。这是伟大祖国空前未有过的大团结的具体表现。由达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼为首，藏族代表出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，不分大小民族，在一律平等的基础上讨论和制定了国家的宪法，选出了主席及国家机关的领导干部，得到了政治上的平等。尤其这次根据毛主席的指示，为了成立包括西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会以及昌都地区人民解放委员会的统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会，特组成筹备小组，现将大家取得一致意见的工作报告，西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会双方呈请国务院予以帮助的计划，西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会双方过去彼此间存在着不和睦和多年来没有解决的问题、这次由于得到了指示和帮助双方在新的友好的基础上在两愿的原则下彻底解决的报告，以及请求发给西藏政府的每年的补助费帮助西藏兑换纸币和帮助改编西藏军队方面的报告等，已先后呈报国务院。这一切充分证明了我们对于中国共产党和伟大毛主席的正确民族政策的信任。希望在这次国务院会议上，经过讨论研究和修改，做出决定，并希望得到各方面的帮助和关怀。我们西藏僧俗人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导下，热烈拥护我国宪法的制定，提高警惕和反对外国帝国主义的造谣和挑拨；提高爱国主义思想，增强和发展各兄弟民族间特别是汉藏民族间和西藏人民内部的团结，以便创造迅速正式成立西藏地方自治机关的条件。过去进藏人民解放军和干部对西藏人民给了许多有益的帮助，在这个基础上我们要进一步依靠国务院及进藏的汉族干部和汉族人民的帮助，努力发展西藏政治、经济、文化、教育等各项事业，建设幸福美满的新西藏，从而充分享受到当家作主的权利。由于我们西藏人民长期落后，文化知识及现代政治经验薄弱，过去工作中曾经发生了缺点和错误，今天在中央无私帮助下，在中国共产党领导下的良好时代里，原来处在强权压迫、落后贫穷深渊中的西藏人民从此得以抬起头来满怀信心地走向繁荣幸福的道路，但因为所进行的工作都是新的，还会不知不觉间发生一些缺点和错误。前来西藏进行帮助的工作同志们非常辛苦。我们对这种很大的恩惠是知道得很清楚的。今后对于各方面工作希望像家人一样毫不客气的像老师教导学生一样从容和蔼的给予耐心的批评指教和帮助。由于西藏现在还没有具有科学知识的民族干部，因此除希望西藏各地及中央民族学院等处大力培养藏族干部外，并需要帮助各项建设事业的大量的汉族干部。我们前后藏的南部和北部各地交通非常不便，人畜苦楚很大，希望逐步给予改善。我们返抵西藏后，在进行工作当中根据实际情况随时呈请给予各方面的帮助。
