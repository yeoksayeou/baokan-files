    Listen to the Workers' Opinions
    Kong Sang
    Last year, the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory built nine three-story standard dormitories, totaling 20,000 square meters. According to the design plan, each household would have a small warehouse, kitchen, and toilet in addition to the bedroom, as well as heating, electricity, and running water. The workers were very excited as they watched the buildings rise one by one, and so well-equipped. Some said that after liberation, we went from building earthen houses to board houses, to large brick houses, and now we are building large buildings. Each year the construction gets better and better, which is a true reflection of the Communist Party's concern for the lives of the working class. Those whose families still lived in other provinces, cities, and counties, and those who lived in cramped conditions, were all happy about moving into new homes.
    However, when it came to allocating the houses, "unexpected" difficulties arose: those who didn't get houses had complaints, and those who did get houses also had complaints. The reason those who got houses had complaints was that the fees were too high. For example, those living in the original dormitories spent at most six yuan RMB per month on coal for both heating and cooking. But living in the new buildings, the heating fee alone (steam heating) was 18.27 yuan per month for a two-room (suite) apartment, 28.98 yuan for a three-room apartment, and 40.95 yuan for a larger apartment. Coal for cooking had to be bought separately. Later, the method of shared occupancy was used, that is, what was originally designed for one family was shared by two families. Although the fee was reduced by half, those who got houses still complained that the rent was too expensive, and some were unwilling to move in. Those who didn't get houses complained that the factory didn't lower the housing standards and build more affordable dormitories so that everyone could have a place to live.
    What does this incident illustrate? It shows that workers currently need more affordable housing, and do not temporarily need those expensive buildings. Anyone who cares about the lives of workers and listens to their voices should make full use of the state's limited investment to build more houses that everyone can afford. That is, first ensure that everyone has a place to live, and then gradually improve dormitory standards based on the improvement of workers' lives. This principle is very simple, but not everyone recognizes it. For example, some cadres in factories, especially newly built important factories and mines, believe that factory buildings are a long-term plan, and dormitories should also be a long-term plan to match; although the standards seem a bit high now, they won't be that good from the perspective of ten or more years from now. They call it euphemistically: "Looking at the problem from a developmental perspective!" Therefore, they advocate that it is better to build fewer, but build them better.
    Undoubtedly, this kind of attempt to do today what should be done tomorrow, without starting from the current living standards of the workers, will inevitably lead to being divorced from the masses, just like the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. We hope that these comrades will listen to the workers' opinions, not subjectively consider the problem from a developmental perspective, and prevent repeating the mistakes of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory.

    听听工人的意见
    孔桑
    去年，齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂新建了九幢三层楼的标准宿舍，共两万平方公尺，按照设计计划，每户除了卧室外，有小仓库、厨房、厕所，还有暖汽、电灯、自来水等设备。工人们眼看一幢一幢的大楼就要落成了，并且又那末讲究，都很兴奋。有些人说，解放后由盖土房到盖板房，盖大砖房，现在又盖大楼房，一年比一年盖的好，这真是共产党关心工人阶级生活的表现。那些家属仍住在外省、外市、外县的和住得很挤的工人，都为即将搬入新居而高兴。
    但是，在分配房子的时候，却遇到了“意外”的困难：没分到房子的人有意见，分到房子的人也有意见。分到房子的人所以有意见，是因为收费太贵。例如，住在原有宿舍的人，连采暖带做饭，每月最多花六元人民币买煤就够了，而住楼房呢，只是采暖费（暖汽），住两间（一套）房的每月要十八元二角七分，住三间房子的要二十八元九角八分，住再大一点的要四○元九角五分，做饭用煤还得另买。后来，用并户的办法进行分配，即原设计为一家住的，由两家共住。这样，收费虽然减了一半，但分到房子的人，仍埋怨房费太贵，其中有的人还不愿搬进去。没分到房子的人，则埋怨工厂为什么不降低房子标准，多盖一些大家都住得起的宿舍，使大家都有房住。
    这件事说明了什么问题？它说明了目前工人需要多盖一些收费低廉的房子，而暂时不需要那些收费太贵的楼房。凡是关心工人生活，倾听工人呼声的人，都应该充分利用国家的有限投资，多盖些大家都住得起的房子。即先使大家有房子住，然后再根据工人生活的改善而逐步提高宿舍标准。这道理本来是很简单的，可是并不是所有的人都认识了。例如有些工厂特别是新建的重要厂矿的干部，认为工厂厂房是百年大计，宿舍也应该是百年大计的才相称；现在看起来，标准虽然高一点，但从十几年以后来考虑就不怎样了。他们美其名曰：“从发展观点看问题！”所以，他们主张宁可少盖一些，但要盖好一些。
    毫无疑问，这种不从工人当前的生活水平出发，企图把应该在明天做的事今天做完，其结果必然会跟齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂一样脱离群众的。我们希望这些同志听听工人的意见，不要主观主义地从发展考虑问题，防止再蹈齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂的覆辙。
