    At the Shizitan Hydropower Station Construction Site
    Yang Cui
    On the Longxi River in Sichuan Province, the people building the Shizitan Hydropower Station are racing against time. They must build the dam connecting the two banks of the Longxi River to a considerable height before the April floods arrive. Giant cranes extend their long arms, pouring batch after batch of freshly mixed concrete onto the dam foundation. Female tractor drivers from the Northeast drive their tractors back and forth without stopping. Thousands of workers are using pneumatic drills to attack the ancient rock formations from three work fronts. The construction site is a scene of intense activity. At night, countless lights illuminate the site as if it were daytime, and all work continues as usual.
    In this day and night of intense construction, many workers have given up holiday breaks. The No. 2 gravel team and the power plant staff were all on duty during the Spring Festival. Young worker Ye Haiyun had originally decided to return to Jiangjin for his wedding on New Year's Day, but in order to ensure that the drainage culvert could pass water ahead of schedule, he had postponed his wedding date to the Spring Festival. When the Spring Festival arrived, the construction of the dam was urgent, so he postponed his wedding again. Master Fu Wannian, who operates an electric shovel, works ten hours a day on the machine. When others advise him to rest, he says, "I'm here to participate in the construction, what's the point of resting!"
    The young shock brigade members are even more active. With the determination to overcome the flood, they take the lead in going into the water to work. Some have their skin scratched by the rocks, they go ashore to apply some medicine, and then jump back into the water. New records are constantly emerging in selfless labor. The sand mining team led by Liu Quanhai exceeded its quota by 60 percent. The daily drilling rate of a pneumatic drill has increased from 25 meters to 50 meters, and the highest has reached 91.73 meters.
    People from all over the country are supporting this newly built hydropower station project. Excavators have been shipped from Beijing, diesel engines from Hubei, and in addition to winches, mixers and all kinds of cranes, a dike-building team has also been transferred from the Northeast. Steel from North China, East China, and Chongqing, moso bamboo from Guizhou, cement from Sichuan cement plants, and timber from Qiezixi Timber Processing Plant are all continuously transported to the construction site, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. The Southwest Coal Mine Administration transferred experienced veteran technicians to the construction site, which played a significant role in the water diversion tunnel project.
    Near the construction site, almost every day three to four thousand farmers bring large amounts of timber, rice straw, grain, vegetables, coal, meat, etc. to the construction site. Cooperatives, hospitals, nurseries, and primary schools have been established. The Chongqing Workers' Cultural Troupe has performed song and dance dramas here, and film projection teams have also come to show movies.
    The face of the Longxi River is changing. For many years, the winding Longxi River has been impacted by waterfalls in one place after another, flowing into the mighty Yangtze River. Today, the construction of the Shizitan Hydropower Station has begun. One of the important projects of the first dry season—the drainage culvert—has passed water ahead of schedule. The dam and spillway projects are also progressing day and night.

    在狮子滩水电站工地上
    杨璀
    四川省的龙溪河上，建设狮子滩水电站的人们正在和时间赛跑。他们要在四月洪水到来之前，把连结龙溪河两岸的堤坝筑到相当的高度。巨大的起重机伸着长臂，把一罐一罐刚搅拌好的混凝土浇灌在坝基上。来自东北的女拖拉机手们驾驶着拖拉机往来不息。数以千计的工人正使用着风钻从三个工作面向古老的岩层进攻。工地上是一片紧张繁忙的气象。一到晚上，无数盏灯光映照得如同白昼一样，一切工作都照常进行。
    在这夜以继日的紧张施工中，许多工人放弃了一个又一个假日的休息。碎石二中队和动力厂的职工春节中全体出勤。青年工人叶海云本来决定元旦回江津结婚，但为要争取排水涵洞提前过水，已把结婚的日子改到春节。到了春节，拦河坝的工程紧迫，他又把婚期移后。操纵电铲机的傅万年老师傅一天在机器上工作十小时，别人劝他休息一下，他说：“我是来参加建设的，尽休息干啥！”
    青年突击队员们更是活跃，他们抱着战胜洪水的决心，带头下水去工作。有的被乱石擦破了皮，上岸擦了点药，又跳下水去了。新纪录在忘我的劳动中不断出现。采砂队刘全海小组突破定额百分之六十。一台风钻一天的钻进率由二十五公尺提高到五十公尺，最高的已达到九十一点七三公尺。
    各地人民都在支援这个新建的水电站工程，北京运来了挖土机，湖北运来了柴油机，东北除了运来卷扬机、混合机和各式各样的起重机外，还调来了筑堤队。华北、华东、重庆等地的钢材，贵州的楠竹、四川水泥厂的水泥、茄子溪木材加工厂的木材都源源运到工地，保证了工程的顺利进展。西南煤矿管理局抽调了有经验的老技工到工地来，对引水隧道工程起了很大的作用。
    工地附近，几乎每天都有三、四千农民把大量木材、稻草、粮食、蔬菜、煤、肉等运到工地来。合作社、医院、托儿所、小学校都建立起来了。重庆市工人文工团来这里演过歌舞剧，电影队也来放映过电影。
    龙溪河的面貌正在改变。多少年来，曲折的龙溪河被一处一处的瀑布冲击着，流向滔滔的长江。今天，狮子滩水电站开始建设了。第一个枯水季节的重要工程之一——排水涵洞提前过水了。拦河坝和溢洪道工程也在日夜进展。
