Waste in the Construction of the New Beijing Hotel
By our reporter Nie Meichu

The New Beijing Hotel is the first high-rise building on Chang'an Avenue, the capital's main thoroughfare. Including the basement, it has a total of nine floors. It was built to accommodate distinguished guests from various countries and representatives of the National People's Congress when they come to Beijing for meetings. A building that bears such a significant political task should naturally be different from ordinary buildings. It is only natural to build it in a magnificent and beautiful way.

However, this does not mean that because it bears such an important task, one can ignore thrift or fail to consider how to complete the task more economically. It is on this point that the original Administrative Bureau of the Government Administration Council, which was in charge of the construction, and the Central Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which designed the building, have major shortcomings.

Let's start with the banquet hall.

The banquet hall is on the first floor, twice the size of an ordinary cinema, with space for 120 tables and 1,200 people to dine simultaneously. Because of its large size, not many units hold large banquets here, so the utilization rate of this banquet hall is very low. The original intention of building this large banquet hall was for the representatives of the National People's Congress to dine together here, and for the State Council and foreign envoys to hold diplomatic banquets. According to such uses, a capacity of about 600 people would have been sufficient. Although there are more than 1,000 representatives to the National People's Congress, such large banquets are held only two or three times a year at most; moreover, there are two smaller Chinese and Western restaurants on both sides of the banquet hall, which can accommodate about 800 people. When the time comes, the doors around the banquet hall can be opened all at once, and guests can dine in three restaurants, still "gathering together." However, the managers of this building did not consider this well at the beginning, resulting in the current scale. In this way, not only is the utilization rate low, but because the banquet hall is twice as large, the corresponding kitchen naturally has to be larger, and there have to be more management personnel, while the number of residential rooms is relatively reduced.

The designers put a lot of effort into the decoration of this building, but some of the decorations are unnecessary. For example, the radiator covers are inlaid with exquisite silver diamond patterns, all made of aluminum, costing a total of 400 million old yuan. The twelve large pillars in the lobby are all gilded. All the bolts, handles, door locks... in the building are made of copper. If only the "hinges" were changed from copper to iron, 100 million old yuan could be saved. The iron window grilles facing the street must be bent with wrought iron instead of cast iron, even though it requires eight times more labor to use wrought iron. The Western restaurant had a row of liquor cabinets more than ten meters long, originally designed to run north-south. After they were made, they were deemed unsightly and were torn down and changed to an east-west orientation. After they were changed, they were still deemed unsightly, and in the end, they were simply torn down and discarded.

In terms of the building's structure, the designers also failed to consider the economic effect well. Too much steel was used in the foundation of the building, so densely that even gravel could not leak through. According to the technical level at the time, if more thought had been given, at least nearly one hundred tons of steel could have been saved.

In terms of applicability, the designers also did not consider it sufficiently. For example, when guests enter the door, they should first take off their coats in the cloakroom, rest in the lounge, and then enter the banquet hall. However, here the cloakroom was designed on the east side of the banquet hall, and the lounge was designed on the west side. Guests have to run back and forth, which is very inconvenient.

The waste caused in the design was great, and there was also a lot of waste in the construction. Because of the need to rush the progress, a large number of workers were added, wasting about 20,000 workdays compared to normal construction, costing an extra 400 million old yuan. The templates were designed too thin, and many were damaged when demolded and could not be reused, wasting about 170 cubic meters of wood, worth 270 million old yuan. Because the wall surface was uneven, the plastering had to be thicker, wasting 110 bags of cement. Because the wood was not completely dried, the flooring in the banquet hall alone took 2,100 workdays to repair. The quality of the foundation's moisture-proof project was poor, and it had to be reworked, losing twenty-five rolls of oil felt, more than 1,000 kilograms of grease, and using an extra 104 workdays. Because the drawings were not released, materials were prepared in advance, and 150,000 extra hollow bricks were ordered, compensating the brick factory 120 million old yuan in lost fees when they were returned. Because the construction site management was chaotic, thirty tons of pre-assembled steel bars could not be found when they were needed, so they had to be hastily reassembled, wasting a lot of labor and steel.

The old Beijing Hotel, which is next to this new building, was built thirty years ago, and now it looks "shabby" and "incompatible" compared to this new building. In order to make the old Beijing Hotel "catch up" with the new Beijing Hotel, the auditorium and dance floor of the old Beijing Hotel have been repainted with colored drawings.

Of course, it should be mentioned that because this building had to meet the needs of the National People's Congress, the time limit was very tight. It took only two months to design and fourteen months to complete the construction; at the same time, we also had little experience in designing and building such high-rise buildings. However, the interests of national industrialization require us to use funds most economically. Squandering money for any reason is, after all, inexcusable.

### 新北京饭店建筑中的浪费

    新北京饭店建筑中的浪费
    本报记者  聂眉初
    新北京饭店是首都的主要街道——东长安街上第一座高层建筑。包括地下室，一共有九层。它是为接待来自各国的贵宾和全国人民代表大会代表到北京开会而建造起来的。担负着这样一个重大政治任务的建筑，自然应该和一般建筑物有所不同。将它建筑得雄伟、漂亮一些，也是理所应当的。
    但是，这并不是说，因为担负了这样一个重大的任务，就可以不注意节约，就可以不考虑怎样更经济地完成任务。正是在这一点上，主持这个建筑的原政务院机关事务管理局和设计这个建筑的建筑工程部中央设计院有着很大的缺点。
    先从宴会厅谈起。
    宴会厅在第一层楼上，比普通的电影院大一倍，可以摆开一百二十桌酒席，容纳一千二百人同时吃饭。因为屋子过大，举行大宴会的单位不多，所以这个宴会厅的使用率很低。本来建造这个大宴会厅的用意是供全国人民代表大会代表在这里聚餐，供国务院和各国使节在这里举行外交性的宴会。按照这样的用途，能容六百人左右也就够了。全国人民代表大会代表虽然有一千多人，但是这样多人的大宴会充其量一年只有两三次；而且在这大宴会厅两旁还有两座较小的中餐厅和西餐厅，能容八百人左右，到时候把宴会厅周围的门一齐打开，客人分散在三个饭厅里吃饭，也仍然可以“欢聚一堂”。但是，这座建筑的主持者开始时没有很好地考虑，结果便建成了现在的规模。这样，不仅使用率低，而且由于宴会厅大了一倍，相应地厨房自然也要大，管理人员也要多，而住人的房间就相对地减少了。
    设计者在这座建筑物的装饰上下了不少功夫，但有些装饰是不太必要的。例如暖气罩上都镶嵌着精致的银色的菱花，全部是用铝做的，一共花了旧币四亿元。门厅里十二根大柱子，全部是贴金的。大楼上所有的插梢、拉手、门锁……都是用铜做的。只是“合页”一项，如果把铜的改成铁的，就可以节省旧币一亿元。临街门窗上的铁棂花，一定要用熟铁来弯，而不肯用生铁铸，尽管用熟铁人工要多八倍。西餐厅里有一排十几公尺长的酒柜，原来设计是南北向的。做好了，嫌不好看，又拆掉了改成东西向。改好了，仍嫌不好看，最后干脆拆掉不要了。
    在建筑的结构方面，设计者也没有很好地考虑经济效果。大楼的基础用了过多的钢筋，密得连石子都漏不下去。按照当时的技术水平，如果多想一想，至少可以节约将近一百吨钢筋。
    在适用方面，设计者也是考虑得不够的。例如，客人一进门，应该先在衣帽间脱掉大衣，再到休息室休息一下，然后进入宴会厅。但是，这里却把衣帽间设计在宴会厅东边，把休息室设计在西边。客人不得不来回跑路，十分不方便。
    设计中造成的浪费很大，施工中的浪费也不少。因为要赶进度，便大量增加工人，比正常施工浪费了约两万个工，多花了旧币四亿元。模板设计得太薄，拆模时很多都拆坏了，不能再用，浪费了约一百七十立方公尺的木材，价值旧币二亿七千万元。因为墙面不平，抹灰就要抹得厚些，浪费了一百一十袋水泥。因为木材干燥得不彻底，仅宴会厅的地板就用了两千一百个工来修理。基础的防潮工程质量不好，返工重做，损失了二十五卷油毡，一千多公斤油膏，多用了一百零四个工。因为图纸没有出来就提前准备材料，空心砖多订了十五万块，退货时给砖厂赔偿了旧币一亿二千万元的损失费。因为工地管理混乱，有三十吨预先装配好的钢筋，到用的时候找不到了，只好临时突击重配，人工和钢筋都浪费了很多。
      和这座新建筑紧挨着的旧北京饭店，是三十年前盖的，现在和这座新楼一比，未免处处显得“寒酸”，“不相称”。为了使旧北京饭店向新北京饭店“看齐”，旧北京饭店的礼堂和舞池都重新加上了彩画。
    当然，应当提到，这座建筑物因为要赶上全国人民代表大会的需用，在时间上限得很紧，前后一共只设计了两个月，要在十四个月中建设完成；同时设计和建筑这样的高楼我们的经验也很少。但是国家工业化的利益要求我们最节约地使用资金，在任何理由下挥金如土，毕竟是不能原谅的。
