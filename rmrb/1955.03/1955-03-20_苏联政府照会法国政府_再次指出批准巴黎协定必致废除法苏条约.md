    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 18th: Soviet Government Note to the French Government.
  Regarding the Franco-Soviet Treaty.
    As reported in the press, the Soviet Government sent a note to the French Government on December 16, 1954, pointing out that the French Government's action in concluding the so-called Paris Agreements fundamentally violated France's obligations under the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    On January 26, Mr. Louis Joxe, the French Ambassador to Moscow, handed the French Government's reply to the Soviet Foreign Minister, V.M. Molotov.
    On March 18, the Soviet Foreign Minister, V.M. Molotov, handed the Soviet Government's new note regarding the Franco-Soviet Treaty to the French Ambassador, Louis Joxe.
    The following are the French Government's note of January 26 and the Soviet Government's note of March 18.
    French Government's Note of January 26
    "The French Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and has the honor to communicate the following:
    In its note of December 16, the Soviet Government informed the French Government that if the agreements signed in Paris on October 23, 1954, were ratified, the Soviet Government would abrogate the Franco-Soviet Treaty.
    The French Government can only say that it is very surprised by this attitude, because this attitude is in no way justifiable.
    The French Government has always believed that the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance would enable our two countries to maintain the relationship that was formed during the war and to guarantee close cooperation between our two countries in the cause of consolidating peace. It is not the fault of the French Government that this cooperative relationship has not developed in a positive direction, either in Europe or in other parts of the world, or within the framework of the United Nations.
    Immediately after the treaty of December 10, 1944, was signed, and on many occasions thereafter, the French Government faced a number of actions and fait accomplis taken by the Soviet Government, which were not in accordance with the letter and spirit of the treaty.
    The policy implemented by the Soviet Government after 1945 actually led to the division of Europe and the division of Germany. When East Germany began to establish land, sea, and air forces in 1950, the deepening of the division of Germany reached a dangerous level.
    The French Government, hoping to be faithful to the memories of the past and faithful to this treaty, has always believed that the purpose of this treaty is in the interest of both contracting parties and in the interest of the whole of Europe, and therefore it has never questioned this treaty. It now has great reason to express regret at the position taken by the Soviet Government.
    The principles on which the Paris Agreements are based do not in fact violate in the slightest the concepts that are the basis of the Franco-Soviet Treaty. These agreements allow West Germany to participate in legitimate collective defense groups that are in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The agreements contain a system of limitations, supervision, and guarantees, and the French Government believes that expanding this system would be beneficial to all countries in Europe. Moreover, the Government of the Federal Republic has guaranteed that it will not resort to force under any circumstances; if this promise is broken, it will be punished by deprivation of any assistance and any guarantees, and will certainly be subject to the sanctions of the Charter.
    The French Government has never participated in any agreement that directly or indirectly favors the initiation of aggression in Europe. This is a consistent and unchangeable principle of French policy, and there are many examples to prove it. Both the Paris Agreements and the Franco-Soviet Treaty are based on such a principle. These agreements are not only not incompatible with the organization and establishment of collective security, but, on the contrary, are a contribution to this cause.
    The French Government is determined to take actions to consolidate peace in Europe, as it has done in the past, and therefore it will use every possibility of holding negotiations or conferences, or creating such possibilities, in order to solve the problems that have existed for nearly ten years. The French Government made this statement when it delivered a speech at the United Nations on November 22, 1954. It believes that all the proposals made in this speech are still fully valid.
    However, if the Soviet Government implements the intentions mentioned in its note of December 16, then it will bear full responsibility for the abrogation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty. As for the French Government, it can only reiterate that this stance will not promote the easing of the situation that the people of all countries hope for.
    The French Government believes that, under all circumstances, it still is and will in the future be faithful to the spirit of this treaty, and it believes that the alliance established in Western Europe by countries with the same ideas will promote the consolidation of European security and serve the cause of peace.
    Moscow, January 26, 1955"
    Soviet Government's Note of March 18
    "Regarding the French Government's note of January 26 this year, the Soviet Government considers it necessary to state the following:
    The note of January 26 proves that the French Government has decided to ratify and implement the Paris Agreements. Therefore, it will be responsible for the remilitarization of West Germany and the pulling of West Germany into the military blocs of certain Western countries against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.
    For this reason, the Soviet Government considers it necessary to state that the French Government's excuse of the so-called "limitations, supervision, and guarantee system" stipulated in the Paris Agreements concerning the establishment of a Western European military group for West Germany is untenable. None of the countries that have suffered from German militarist aggression in the past can believe that if German militarism is revived as stipulated in the Paris Agreements, any such guarantees on paper can become a real guarantee to prevent the resurgence of German aggression. Neither the Soviet people, the French people, nor the peace-loving people of other European countries can forget all this.
    The Soviet Government cannot agree with the French Government's claim that the so-called Paris Agreements can promote the establishment of European security. If the French Government is truly concerned about establishing European security, it has no reason to reject the Soviet proposal to organize a European collective security system. And the French Government has not put forward any other proposals, and has even refused to participate in an all-European conference to discuss this issue.
    Regarding the point mentioned in the Soviet Government's note of December 16, 1954, that the French Government's current policy not only does not conform to the obligations undertaken by France under the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, but is directly aimed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe, the French Government has nothing to say about this. The French Government's promotion of the ratification of the Paris Agreements is tantamount to personally promoting the revival of German militarism, and promoting the joining of a rearmed West Germany into the Western European military alliance and the North Atlantic bloc. This will inevitably greatly complicate the entire European situation, and greatly deepen the danger of a new war in Europe.
    Such a policy of the French Government fundamentally violates the spirit and letter of the Franco-Soviet Treaty.
    Based on all of the above, the Soviet Government reiterates the position it expressed in its note of December 16, 1954, and states again that the act of ratifying the Paris Agreements will inevitably lead to the abrogation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and the French Government will bear full responsibility for this.
    Moscow, March 18, 1955"
    The French Ambassador said that he would immediately forward the above-mentioned note to his government.

### 苏联政府照会法国政府  再次指出批准巴黎协定必致废除法苏条约

    苏联政府照会法国政府
    再次指出批准巴黎协定必致废除法苏条约
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：苏联政府致法国政府的照会。
  关于法苏条约。
    如报纸所报道，苏联政府曾在一九五四年十二月十六日照会法国政府，指出法国政府缔结所谓巴黎协定的行动，是根本违反法国根据法苏同盟互助条约所承担的义务的。
    一月二十六日，法国驻莫斯科大使路易·约克斯先生把法国政府的复照交给苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫。
    三月十八日，苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫把苏联政府关于法苏条约的新照会交给法国大使路易·约克斯先生。
    下面是法国政府一月二十六日的照会和苏联政府三月十八日的照会。
    法国政府一月二十六日的照会
    “法国大使馆向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部致意，并谨转达下列事项：
    苏联政府在十二月十六日的照会中通知法国政府说，如果一九五四年十月二十三日在巴黎签订的协定获得批准，苏联政府就要废除法苏条约。
    法国政府只能说，它对这种态度感到非常惊异，因为这种态度是无论如何也说不过去的。
    法国政府一向认为，法苏同盟互助条约能够使我们两国在战时所形成的关系继续保持下去，并且保证我们两国在争取巩固和平的事业中的密切合作。这种合作关系后来无论在欧洲或是在世界其他地区，或者在联合国组织的范围内，都没有朝着良好的方向发展，这是不能责怪法国政府的。
    在一九四四年十二月十日的条约刚刚签订之后，以及在以后的许多场合中，法国政府面临苏联政府所采取的好些行动和既成事实，这些行动和事实都是不符合条约的文字和精神的。
    苏联政府在一九四五年以后实行的政策实际上导致欧洲的分裂和德国的分裂。当东德从一九五零年开始建立陆、海、空军的时候，德国分裂的加深达到了危险的程度。
    法国政府希望忠实于过去的回忆和忠实于这个条约，它始终认为这个条约的目的既符合缔约双方的利益又符合整个欧洲的利益，因此它从来没有对这一条约提出过疑问。它现在有极大理由对苏联政府所采取的立场表示遗憾。
    巴黎协定所依据的原则实际上丝毫也不违反作为法苏条约的基础的观念。这些协定使西德参加符合于联合国宪章的合法的集体防务集团。在协定内包含有限制、监督和保证的制度，法国政府认为扩大这种制度是会对欧洲所有国家有益的。况且联邦共和国政府已保证在任何情况下不诉诸武力；如果破坏了这种诺言，就要引起剥夺任何的援助和任何的保证以示惩罚，就一定会受到宪章的制裁。
    法国政府从来没有参加过直接或间接有利于在欧洲发动侵略的协定，这是法国政策的一贯不变的原则，是有许多事例可以证明的，无论是巴黎协定或是法苏条约都正是以这样一个原则为根据的。这些协定不仅不是同组织和建立集体安全不相容，而且相反地，是对这一事业的一种贡献。
    法国政府决心采取它过去所采取过的巩固欧洲和平的行动，因此它将利用一切举行谈判或会议的可能性或创造这种可能性，以求解决近十年来所存在的问题。法国政府一九五四年十一月二十二日在联合国讲坛上发表演说时曾经作了这种表示。它认为这次演说中所提出的一切建议仍然完全有效。
    但是，如果苏联政府实现了它在十二月十六日的照会中所提到的意图，那么它将对法苏条约的废除负完全责任。至于法国政府，它只能重申，这种姿态不能促进各国人民所希望的局势的缓和。
    法国政府认为，无论在什么情况下，它现在仍然而且将来还要忠实于这一条约的精神，它相信，由抱着同样思想的国家在西欧建立的联盟将促进欧洲安全的巩固和服务于和平事业。
    一九五五年一月二十六日，莫斯科”
    苏联政府三月十八日的照会
    “对于法国政府今年一月二十六日的照会，苏联政府认为有必要声明如下：
    一月二十六日的照会证明，法国政府已经决定要批准和实施巴黎协定。因此，它将对西德的重新军国主义化和西德被拉入某些西方国家反对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的军事集团负责。
    为此，苏联政府认为必须声明，法国政府把关于建立西欧军事集团的巴黎协定对西德所规定的所谓“限制、监督和保证制度”当作藉口，这是不能成立的。凡是在过去遭受德国军国主义侵略的国家都不能相信，如果德国军国主义像巴黎协定所规定的那样复活了起来，任何这种纸上的保证能够成为防止德国侵略再起的真正的保证。无论苏联人民、法国人民或者欧洲其他国家的爱好和平的人民，都不能忘记这一切。
    苏联政府不能同意法国政府提到的所谓巴黎协定能促进欧洲安全的确立的说法。假如法国政府真正关心确立欧洲的安全，它就没有理由拒绝苏联关于组织欧洲集体安全体系的建议。而法国政府没有提出任何其他建议，甚至还拒绝参加讨论这个问题的全欧会议。
    对于苏联政府在一九五四年十二月十六日的照会中所说到的一点，即法国政府目前的政策不仅不符合法国根据法苏同盟互助条约所承担的义务，而且是直接针对苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的国家的，对于这一点法国政府却无话可说。法国政府促使巴黎协定获得批准，就是亲手促进德国军国主义的复活，促使重新武装起来的西德加入西欧军事联盟和北大西洋集团，这就使整个欧洲局势不可避免地要大大地复杂起来，并且大大地加深欧洲新战争的危险。
    法国政府这样的政策根本违反法苏条约的精神和文字。
    根据以上所述一切，苏联政府重申它在一九五四年十二月十六日的照会中所表明的立场，并且再次声明，批准巴黎协定的举动必将导致法苏同盟互助条约的废除，法国政府对这一点将要负完全的责任。
    一九五五年三月十八日，莫斯科”
    法国大使说，他将立刻把上述照会转交给本国政府。
