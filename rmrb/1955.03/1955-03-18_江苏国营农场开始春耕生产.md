Jiangsu State-Owned Farms Begin Spring Plowing and Production
    Seven state-owned mechanized farms in Jiangsu Province, including Dongxin, Huaihai, Qingyihu, Lianhu, Baoyinghu, Yuntai, and Fengxian, are intensively engaged in spring plowing and production. The Dongxin Farm had already used machines to harrow over 17,000 mu of wheat fields by the middle of February. At the Yuntai Farm, the rate of seedling damage was reduced to one in a thousand during the spring harrowing of over 10,000 mu of wheat fields; the spring harrowing loosened the soil and helped retain moisture. The Huaihai Farm, learning from last year's wheat field salinization, is actively improving wheat field drainage ditches this year to lower the water table. The farms are also seizing the opportunity to apply top dressing to the wheat fields. The Qingyihu Farm has applied all of its accumulated 820,000 jin of organic fertilizer to the fields. The Huaihai Farm is using diluted manure to fertilize the wheat, and the Lianhu Farm accumulated over 50,000 dan of river mud and made 3,800 dan of compost in February. They also built ash sheds and improved the method of storing grass ash. At present, the farms have completed the preparation of seeds, fertilizers, and pest control agents for spring sowing.

    江苏国营农场开始春耕生产
    江苏省东辛、淮海、青伊湖、练湖、宝应湖、云台、奉贤等七个国营机械农场正紧张地开展春耕生产。东辛农场在二月份中已用机器耙过麦田一万七千多亩。云台农场在一万多亩麦田春耙作业中，伤苗率降低到千分之一，春耙疏松了麦田的土壤，并能保蓄水分。淮海农场接受去年麦田返碱的教训，今年积极整理好麦田排水沟，以降低地下水位。各场还抓紧时机在麦田里追肥。青伊湖农场把自积的八十二万余斤有机质肥料全部施下田，淮海农场用稀黄粪浇麦，练湖农场在二月份积好河泥五万多担，制堆肥三千八百担，并搭盖了灰棚，改进了草木灰的堆积工作。目前各农场已做好春播种子、肥料、治虫药剂等的准备工作。
