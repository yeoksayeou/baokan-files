The Anyang Machinery Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Henan Province, began to manufacture double-wheel double-share plows after receiving the task of trial production in October 1954. The factory sent technicians to the local state-owned Kaifeng Machinery Factory to learn, and the Henan Provincial Department of Industry also sent technicians to provide specific guidance. Since February 1955, the Anyang Machinery Factory has begun to manufacture tools for producing double-wheel double-share plows while trial-producing samples. By the end of February, the five double-wheel double-share plow samples produced by the factory were thoroughly inspected by technicians from the Henan Provincial Department of Industry, the Henan Provincial Agricultural Technology Extension Station, and the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation in the factory and in the fields. They were deemed to fully meet the standards stipulated by the First Ministry of Machine Building. Agricultural cooperative members who visited the experiment also said happily: "This kind of plow is really good. It is easy to pull, plows deeply, and turns the soil evenly."

After the successful trial production of double-wheel double-share plows, the Anyang Machinery Factory has been approved to start mass production in March. In 1955, this factory and the Kaifeng Machinery Factory will manufacture more than 56,000 double-wheel double-share plows to supply agricultural production cooperatives in Henan and Shaanxi provinces.

    安阳机械厂开始制造双铧犁
    河南省地方国营安阳机械厂自一九五四年十月接受试制双轮双铧犁的任务后，曾派技术工人到地方国营开封机械厂学习，河南省工业厅并派技术人员具体指导。安阳机械厂自一九五五年二月即开始一面制造生产双轮双铧犁的工具，一面试制样品。到二月底，这个厂制出的五部双轮双铧犁样品，经河南省工业厅、河南省农业技术推广站和河南省供销合作社联合社技术人员在厂内和田间的详细检验，认为完全符合第一机械工业部规定的标准。参观试验的农业社社员们还高兴地说：“这种犁真好，拉的轻，犁的深，土翻的平。”
    安阳机械厂在试制双轮双铧犁成功后，已被批准自三月份开始大量生产。这个厂和开封机械厂在一九五五年将制造五万六千多部双轮双铧犁，供给河南、陕西两省的农业生产合作社使用。
