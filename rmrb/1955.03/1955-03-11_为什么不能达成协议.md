Why an Agreement Cannot Be Reached
Wang Pu

According to the state plan, the construction task of Harbin Electric Motor Factory should be completed this year. The Motor Factory (hereinafter referred to as Party A) and the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company of the Electrical Industry Administration Bureau (hereinafter referred to as Party B), which is responsible for the contracted installation task, both hope to complete this year’s arduous equipment installation task ahead of schedule so that the factory can be put into production as soon as possible. There are conditions to realize this hope: Most of the equipment scheduled to arrive in January and February of this year arrived on time; Party B has been responsible for the installation from the beginning, and will continue construction this year, so everything does not have to start from scratch...

However, things are not going smoothly. From mid-December of last year to the end of January of this year, the two parties held more than a dozen meetings of all sizes, but they still could not reach an agreement on the time of equipment arrival, compensation for losses, technical requirements for installation, and even trivial matters such as a light bulb or a nail. In almost every meeting, Party A was asking Party B to "serve production!" Party B asked Party A to "be responsible for basic construction!" Party A accused Party B of "poor installation technology!" Party B accused Party A of "equipment problems!" Party A cursed Party B as a "quibbling king!" Party B cursed Party A as "profiteering!"

Such uncoordinated phenomena are by no means isolated in the current industrial construction and production. Some comrades defend these behaviors, saying: "The positions of each unit are different, and disputes are unavoidable." The so-called "position" here refers to a position that only cares about the interests of one's own unit and disregards the overall interests. Under the domination of this position, the two parties, in their common cause, do not first strictly examine and improve their own work to reduce the difficulties of the other party and accelerate the development of the construction cause, but first emphasize their own difficulties and try to sacrifice the interests of others to satisfy their own demands. This is of no use to the country's industrial construction and production.

The above-mentioned Party A and Party B are an example: Party A does not first try to improve the equipment ordering work and strive for the timely arrival of equipment to reduce the difficulties caused to Party B due to the delayed arrival of equipment, but blindly demands that Party B "install the equipment whenever it arrives"; Party B, on the other hand, does not consider that Party A's equipment ordering work does have difficulties, and does not correspondingly change the construction management methods, but blindly demands that Party A set an early deadline for the arrival of equipment, otherwise it will not work. Since they insist on this way in both major and minor matters, the construction agreement has not been reached for a long time, and therefore much work has been stagnated for a long time.

In our country, any construction and production work is for the realization of the overall task of socialist industrialization. In order to accelerate the realization of this overall task, the relevant units need to maintain close contact, support each other, supervise each other, you actively help me overcome difficulties, and I actively create favorable conditions for you. It should be recognized that here there is only a difference in division of labor, and there is absolutely no difference in position!

    为什么不能达成协议
    王朴
    哈尔滨电机厂的建设任务，按照国家的计划应该在今年全部完工。电机厂（简称甲方）和负责承包安装任务的电器工业管理局机械电器安装公司（简称乙方），都希望提前完成今年的艰巨的设备安装任务，使工厂早日投入生产。实现这个希望，也是有条件的：今年一月和二月份计划到达的设备大都按时到来了；乙方从开头就负责安装，今年继续施工，一切不用从头做起……。
    但是，事情的进行并不怎样顺利。从去年十二月中旬到今年一月底，双方开大会小会十几次，始终不能在关于设备到达时间、关于赔偿损失、关于安装技术要求，甚至关于一个灯泡、一颗铁钉等鸡毛蒜皮的小事达成协议。几乎每一次会议上，甲方都在要求乙方“为生产服务！”乙方则要求甲方“对基本建设负责！”甲方指责乙方
  “安装技术不高！”乙方则指责甲方“设备有问题！”甲骂乙是“扯皮大王！”乙则骂甲是“唯利是图！”
    像这样不协调的现象，在当前的工业建设和生产中绝不是个别的。有些同志为这些行为辩护说：“各个单位的立场不同，争吵是免不了的。”这里所谓“立场”，是指只顾本位利益、不顾整体利益的立场。在这种立场的支配下，双方在共同的事业中，不是首先严格检查和改进自己的工作，以减轻对方的困难，加速建设事业的发展，而是首先强调自己的困难，处处想牺牲别人的利益来满足自己的要求。这对于国家的工业建设和生产毫无用处。
    上面讲的甲方和乙方就是一个例子：甲方不首先设法改进设备订货工作，争取设备按期到达，以减轻乙方因设备脱期到达而引起的困难，而是一味要求乙方“什么时候到货什么时候安装”；乙方呢，也不考虑甲方的设备订货工作确有困难，不相应地改变施工管理方法，而是一味要求甲方过早地截止设备到达日期，否则便不干。大事小事都这样坚持，所以施工协议长期达不成，因而许多工作也就长期停顿着。
    在我们国家里，任何建设和生产工作，都是为了实现社会主义工业化的总任务。为了加速这个总任务的实现，需要各有关单位密切联系，互相支援，互相督促，你主动帮助我克服困难，我主动为你创造有利条件。应该认识：在这里只有分工的不同，绝没有立场的不同！
