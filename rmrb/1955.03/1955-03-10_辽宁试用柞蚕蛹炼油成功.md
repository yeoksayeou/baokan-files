Liaoning Province’s Tussah Silk Company has achieved initial success in extracting oil from tussah silkworm pupae. Approximately 24.5 jin of pupae oil can be extracted from every 100 jin of tussah silkworm pupae. This oil can be used for industrial purposes, and the oil cake can be used as agricultural fertilizer or as livestock feed. Liaoning Province's tussah silk production accounts for about two-thirds of the country's total production. In the past, the silkworm pupae left over after tussah cocoons were reeled into silk were not well utilized. Now, it is estimated that several million jin of pupae oil can be extracted annually throughout the province. (Our Shenyang Reporter)

    辽宁试用柞蚕蛹炼油成功
    辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司用柞蚕蛹提炼蛹油已初步试验成功。每百斤柞蚕蛹可提炼蛹油二十四斤半左右。这种油可供工业用，油饼还可作农业肥料或作牲畜饲料。辽宁省柞蚕产量占全国总产量的三分之二左右。过去，柞蚕茧经过缫丝后剩下来的蚕蛹，没有很好利用，现在全省每年估计可提炼出几百万斤蛹油。　（本报沈阳记者）
