    Promote Grain Conservation
    From December of last year to February of this year, the Jiangsu Xinhua Daily published more than ten letters from readers, exposing the serious waste of grain in factories, government offices, schools, and some urban residents. For example, the Changzhou Joint State-Private Da Ming Textile Factory falsely reported its grain purchase plan, with the amount requested monthly reaching approximately 6% of the number of employees. The factory's catering staff believed that "it is better to make the grain purchase plan generous than tight, and better to cook more rice and steam more buns than less." The fourteen pigs raised in the factory were mainly fed with leftover buns and congee. The newspaper gave enthusiastic support to these exposures from the masses. Xinhua Daily also published a special article entitled "Talking with Urban People about Cherishing Grain and Conserving Grain," which criticized erroneous ideas such as "a bun is only the size of a fist, what does it matter if one or two are wasted" and "it's inevitable that a large organization will waste a little." At the same time, the Xinhua Daily editorial department also convened a symposium on "Grain Conservation Issues" for cooks and administrators from some government offices, factories, and schools in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, and published the grain conservation experiences exchanged at the meeting in the newspaper. The newspaper also commended units that cherished and conserved grain.
    The Xinhua Daily's promotion of opposing grain waste has received a response and support from the vast number of readers. This is entirely correct. Other newspapers should also strengthen publicity in this area, establish a new social atmosphere of "considering grain conservation as honorable and grain waste as shameful," and do a good job in grain conservation.

    宣传节约粮食
    江苏新华日报从去年十二月到今年二月，陆续发表了十多封读者来信，揭露了工厂、机关、学校及某些城市居民中的严重浪费粮食的现象。如常州公私合营大明纺织厂虚报购粮计划，每月竟约达职工人数的百分之六。这个厂的膳食工作人员认为“造购粮计划宁宽勿紧，煮饭蒸馒头宁多勿少”。厂里养的十四只猪，主要靠剩下的馒头稀饭作饲料。对于来自群众的这些揭发，报纸给了热情的支持。新华日报又发表了“与城市人民谈爱惜粮食节约粮食问题”的专文，对“馒头只有拳头大，浪费个把算个啥”、“机构大，浪费一点是难免的”等错误认识，进行了批判。与此同时，新华日报编辑部还召集江苏省和南京市的一些机关、工厂和学校的炊事员、管理员，举行了“节约粮食问题”座谈会，把会上交流的节约粮食的经验整理后在报上发表。报纸对爱护和节约粮食的单位也进行了表扬。
    新华日报反对浪费粮食的宣传，得到了广大读者的响应和拥护。这样做是完全正确的。其他报纸也应该加强这一方面的宣传，树立以“节约粮食为荣、浪费粮食为耻”的社会新风气，做好节约粮食的工作。　（王志民）
