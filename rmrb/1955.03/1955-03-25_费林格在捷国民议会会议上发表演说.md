Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 22nd: Zdeněk Fierlinger, Chairman of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, delivered a speech at the meeting of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic on March 21st.

    Fierlinger said: The Presidium of the Czechoslovak National Assembly considers it its responsibility to focus its efforts on the international situation, on our struggle for peace, and especially on the declaration issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9th to the people and parliaments of all countries, which emphasized the special responsibility of parliaments for maintaining and consolidating peace. The Presidium of the National Assembly attaches great importance to the lofty initiative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and unconditionally and fully agrees with this declaration.

    Undoubtedly, direct contact between the parliaments of various countries—exchanging parliamentary delegations and having parliamentary delegations from one country deliver speeches in the parliaments of other countries—will greatly contribute to the aspirations of the people of all countries to guarantee peaceful coexistence and cooperation. The National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic has already taken a major step in this direction last December: its representatives held talks in Prague with representatives of the Parliament of the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. The meeting, held in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, vividly demonstrated the agreement of the three neighboring countries on all issues of domestic and foreign policy. It showed the determination of the three countries to consistently and steadfastly defend world peace. In order to safeguard and consolidate peace and ensure the peaceful and creative labor of peace-loving people, the Presidium of the National Assembly now also suggests to other countries the establishment of such sincere cooperation between parliaments. We believe that establishing such direct contact between parliaments will be very beneficial.

    Fierlinger continued, we believe that even in the parliaments of capitalist countries, there are people who, like us, have a sincere desire for peace, and we can exchange views with them on our common interests in this regard. The debate in the parliaments of various countries on the Paris Agreements, which stipulate the remilitarization of West Germany, shows that such measures are very unpopular even in the West. In the French National Assembly, only a small number of deputies voted in favor of ratifying this agreement. It was only under the pressure and constant threats from American and British politicians that the agreement was finally ratified. In the British Parliament, only a small number of deputies voted in favor of the Paris Agreements. In West Germany, all trade union organizations and mass political organizations of the working people have very resolutely risen up against the rearmament of West Germany. However, despite this, the Bonn parliament, disregarding the interests of the German people, ratified the Paris Agreements, which make international negotiations on the unification of Germany impossible.

    Clearly, this "position of strength" policy, which threatens a new war using atomic weapons, this policy of intimidation and terror, aims to economically and politically control other countries. We will never give in to this policy. We believe that we can win a relaxation of international tensions, but we will achieve this not by restricting the freedom, sovereignty, and national rights of other countries and other nations, but precisely by guaranteeing and strengthening their democratic rights, in accordance with their constant growth and the requirements of free development. We do not beg for peace, nor are we intimidated by others threatening us, putting pressure on us, imposing economic boycotts on us, or blackmailing us, nor are we daunted by the insidious sabotage activities carried out by agencies of other countries on our territory in violation of all principles of international law. On the contrary, we will strengthen our defense capabilities and relentlessly crush all attempts by the enemy. We oppose the aggressive blocs and alliances organized under the instigation of the American government group, and we will take all necessary measures with our friends and allies to ensure our security. We will continue to comprehensively strengthen our mutual friendship and assistance in the spirit of the Moscow Eight-Nation Conference.

    Our countries, considering the need to consolidate defense, are preparing to unite our forces and to place these forces under unified command once the Western countries ratify the Paris Agreements. Peace-loving countries have to take seriously the danger posed by the frantic arms expansion by the United States, Britain, France, and some other countries. The US national budget confirms that this danger exists because two-thirds of the US national budget is for military expenditures, which is several times more than the usual military budget. Almost a quarter of US industrial production is for arms production. The Presidium of the National Assembly welcomes the new proposal made by the Soviet government on February 18, 1955: that all countries completely destroy the atomic and hydrogen weapons now stored, so that atomic raw materials are used only for peaceful purposes; that no country increase the size of its armed forces and armaments beyond the levels of January 1, 1955, nor increase its military expenditures beyond the appropriations in the 1955 budget.

    We sincerely hope that the numerous initiatives made by Soviet state activists to save the world from the terrible danger of using atomic and hydrogen bombs will be given serious attention by Western countries. Banning atomic weapons is in line with the genuine aspirations of the people of all countries in the world and has therefore received a strong response from public opinion in Western countries.

    However, politicians and military figures in Western countries are openly threatening the people of other countries with the use of these deadly weapons.

    At the initiative of the United States, the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a meeting in Paris last December. That meeting adopted a resolution on preparing for a war using atomic weapons. Recently, the British Parliament, on the advice of Prime Minister Churchill, approved a bill to manufacture hydrogen bombs. In his speech, the Prime Minister attacked the Soviet Union and the people's democracies in a completely hostile tone and attempted to threaten them with Britain's use of hydrogen bombs in a war. Needless to say, no one is currently planning to attack Britain with conventional weapons or atomic weapons. Undeniably, the British government's disregard for the Soviet Union's sincere proposals for establishing an all-European security system, banning weapons of mass destruction, and implementing disarmament, and its adoption of such a heinous step, will not promote the relaxation of international tensions at all. This measure will greatly complicate future negotiations and will complicate any existing trade and cultural relations that the peace-loving countries sincerely hope to consolidate and expand in the spirit of peaceful coexistence between countries.

    Fierlinger also said that it is the Soviet state activists who have proven countless times in the past decade their sincere desire for peace and international cooperation. Clearly, while Soviet state activists consistently pursue a policy of peace, they never sacrifice the freedom and independence of the people of other countries, especially the fraternal people of the people's democracies, and abandon their principles. They never yield to the threats of fascist dictators, and the threats of arrogant generals and commanders who dream of gaining cheap glory in new wars cannot intimidate them. Although the Soviet Union believes its strength is indestructible, it never gives up the opportunity to express its peaceful wishes in fact.

    Fierlinger emphasized the following famous words of N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union: The Soviet Union hopes to reach an agreement that will lead to a relaxation of international tensions.

    Fierlinger said: All of our people agree with this opinion of Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. We will realistically consider all possibilities in the spirit of Soviet policy to reach close international agreements to ensure that everyone obtains a truly just peace. We will consider everything that can promote the peaceful coexistence of all countries and peoples in the world. In any case, we will resolutely defend peace, defend our freedom and national independence.

    Fierlinger concluded by saying that recently, the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace has begun collecting signatures for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" against the threat of atomic war. When we sign this "Appeal to the Peoples of the World," we realize that after we sign, we should take action.

    This year we will commemorate the anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of our country, which is of great significance. If we look back at the past decade, look back at this flourishing period, if we note the profound changes and unprecedented consolidation that have taken place in the great peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, then we can come to this conclusion: we will continue to move forward bravely towards our future, and we firmly believe that the forces of reaction and war will eventually give way to our joint efforts, and we will achieve peace.

    费林格在捷国民议会会议上发表演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格二十二日电：捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会主席兹德尼克·费林格，三月二十一日在捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会会议上发表了演说。
    费林格说：捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席团认为有责任集中力量，注意国际局势，注意我们争取和平的斗争，尤其注意苏联最高苏维埃在二月九日向全世界各国人民和议会所发表的、着重指出的议会对维护和巩固和平负有特别责任的宣言。国民议会主席团十分重视苏联最高苏维埃的崇高倡议，并且无条件地完全同意这个宣言。
    毫无疑问，各国议会之间的直接联系——交换议会代表团和一国的议会代表团在其他国家的议会中发表演说——将在极大程度上有助于各国人民要求保障和平共处和合作的愿望。捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会在去年十二月已经在这方面走了一大步：它的代表同波兰人民共和国议会和德意志民主共和国人民议院的代表在布拉格举行了会谈。在互相谅解的气氛中举行的那次会谈生动地显示了三个毗邻国家对一切内政外交政策问题的看法的一致。它表明了三个国家决心始终一贯、坚定不移地保卫世界和平。为了维护和巩固和平和保障爱好和平人民的和平的创造性劳动，国民议会主席团现在也向其他国家建议建立议会之间的这种真诚合作。我们相信，各国议会间建立这种直接联系将是十分有益的。
    费林格继续说，我们相信，就是在资本主义国家的议会里，也有人和我们一样怀着要求和平的真诚愿望，我们可以和他们就我们这方面的共同利益交换意见。各国议会就规定西德重新军国主义化的巴黎协定进行辩论的情况说明，这种措施就是在西方也非常不得人心。在法国国民议会中，只有少数议员投票赞成批准这个协定。只是在美国和英国政治人物的压力和不断的威胁之下，这个协定才终于得以批准。在英国议会中，也只有少数议员投票赞成巴黎协定。在西德，所有劳动人民的工会组织和群众政治组织都非常坚决地起来反对重新武装西德。然而，尽管如此，波恩议会却不考虑德国人民的利益，批准了巴黎协定，这个协定使得关于统一德国的国际谈判成为不可能。
    显然，这种以使用原子武器的新战争相威胁的“实力地位”政策，这种恐吓和恐怖的政策目的在于让一些国家在经济上和政治上控制其他国家。我们决不对这种政策让步。我们相信，我们能够争取得国际紧张局势的缓和，然而我们达到这一点并不是靠限制其他国家和其他民族的自由、主权和民族权利，而恰恰相反，是靠保证和加强它们的民主权利，以符合它们经常的成长和自由发展的要求。我们不乞求和平，也不因别人对我们进行威吓、对我们施以压力、对我们实行经济抵制和吓诈，也不因其他国家的机构违背一切国际法的原则在我们的领土上进行阴险的破坏活动而被吓倒。相反地，我们要加强我们的国防力量，并将无情地粉碎敌人的一切企图。我们反对在美国政府集团发动下所组织的侵略集团和联盟，我们将和我们的朋友和盟国采取一切必要的措施，以保障我们的安全。我们今后仍然要本着莫斯科八国会议的精神，全面地加强我们的相互友谊和帮助。
    我们这些国家由于考虑到巩固防务的必要性，正在准备联合我们的力量并且要在西方国家一旦批准巴黎协定后把这些力量置于统一的指挥之下。爱好和平的国家不得不认真看待由于美国、英国、法国和其他某些国家疯狂扩军所造成的危险。美国国家预算使我们确认这一危险是存在的，因为美国国家预算中有三分之二是军事开支，这比通常的军事预算多几倍。几乎四分之一的美国工业生产是军火生产。国民议会主席团欢迎苏联政府在一九五五年二月十八日提出的下面这一新建议：各国完全销毁现在储存的原子武器和氢武器，使原子原料只用于和平目的；各国不得把自己的武装部队和军备的数量增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，也不得把自己的军事开支增加到超过一九五五年度预算拨款的水平。
    我们衷心地希望，苏联国家活动家为了使世界免除采用原子弹和氢弹的可怕危险所作的多次倡议，会受到西方国家的重视。禁止原子武器是符合全世界各国人民的真正愿望的，因而得到西方国家的舆论有力的反应。
    但是，西方国家的政治家和军事家却在公然以使用这种致人死命的武器来威胁其他国家的人民。
    根据美国的倡议，北大西洋公约参加国于去年十二月在巴黎举行了会议。那次会议通过了关于准备采用原子武器的战争的决议。最近，英国议会根据邱吉尔首相的建议批准了制造氢弹的议案。这位首相在演说中以十足敌视的口吻攻击了苏联和人民民主国家，并且企图以英国将在战争中使用氢弹进行威胁。不用说，现在并没有任何人在打算用普通武器，或是原子武器去进攻英国。无可争辩的，英国政府无视苏联关于建立全欧安全体系、禁止大规模毁灭性武器和实行裁军的真诚建议，而采取这种穷凶极恶的步骤，这是完全不能促进国际紧张局势的缓和的。这种措施将使今后的谈判大大复杂起来，并且会使爱好和平国家阵营真诚希望本着各国和平共处的精神加以巩固和扩大的任何现有的贸易和文化关系复杂起来。
    费林格还说，正是苏联国家活动家在最近十年中无数次地证明了他们争取和平和国际合作的真挚愿望。显然，苏联国家活动家一方面一贯执行着和平的政策，一方面他们绝不牺牲其他国家人民、特别是人民民主国家兄弟人民的自由和独立而放弃自己的原则。他们从不屈服于法西斯独裁者的威胁，而梦想在新的战争中获得廉价荣誉的傲慢的将军和统帅的威胁也不能吓倒他们。虽然苏联相信自己的力量是不可摧毁的，但是它从来不放弃用事实表示自己和平愿望的机会。
    费林格着重指出苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁下面一段著名的话：苏联希望达成协议，以导致国际紧张局势的缓和。
    费林格说：我们全体人民同意苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的这个意见。我们将本着苏联政策的精神现实地考虑一切可能性，以达成密切的国际协议来保证大家获得真正正义的和平。我们将考虑能够促进世界各国和各国人民和平共处的一切东西。在任何情况下，我们都将坚决地保卫和平，保卫自己的自由和国家的独立。
    费林格最后说，最近，捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会已经开始为世界和平理事会反对原子战争威胁的“告全世界人民书”征集签名。我们在这个“告全世界人民书”上签名时意识到，我们签名之后，就应当采取行动。
    今年我们将纪念具有重大意义的苏军解放我国纪念日。如果回顾一下过去的十年，回顾一下这个蓬勃发展的时期，如果我们注意到以苏联为首的伟大的和平阵营中所发生的深刻变化和空前的巩固，那么我们就可以作出这样的结论：我们将继续勇往直前地向着我们的未来前进，我们坚决相信，反动和战争势力终将在我们共同的努力下让步，我们将取得和平。
