    Smashing the Sinister Plot to Use Atomic Weapons
    Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain
    In response to the World Peace Council's call to the people of the world, the peace-loving Chinese people resolutely oppose the atomic intimidation and the plot to provoke another world war being frantically carried out by the American aggressor clique. The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace jointly issued a "Resolution on Launching a Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons," which is entirely in line with the people's wishes. We, the Tibetan people, express our warm support for this resolution.
    The Chinese people have consistently advocated peace. We have actively fulfilled our responsibilities to the best of our ability for the great cause of maintaining world peace, and we have achieved significant victories. At the same time, on the other hand, we are not afraid of war, and especially will we never beg for peace with our own territory, which is even more unwavering. However, the American aggressor clique has consistently disregarded the condemnation of the people of the world and pursued a policy of war adventure, especially recently, even more frantically obstructing our just action to liberate Taiwan and using atomic weapons to threaten peace-loving people. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and no interference from American imperialism is allowed. Taiwan must be liberated, and we will never give up until victory. The current threat of atomic war has aroused great anger among the people of the world, and the forces against war are rapidly growing. We believe that, with the unanimous opposition of the peace-loving people of the world, the American imperialists' sinister plot to massacre humanity with atomic weapons will inevitably fail, as stated in the resolution.
    We firmly demand that atomic energy be used for peaceful construction, just as the advanced Soviet people have opened up a glorious path for the peaceful use of atomic energy and achieved great success, to serve the happiness of mankind forever.

    粉碎使用原子武器的罪恶阴谋
    班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞
    爱好和平的中国人民为了响应世界和平理事会所发出的“告全世界人民书”的号召，坚决反对美国侵略集团正在疯狂进行的原子恫吓和准备挑起再一次世界大战的阴谋，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员联合发出了“关于发动反对使用原子武器签名运动的决议”，这是完全符合人心的。我们西藏民族对于这一决议表示热烈的拥护。
    中国人民一贯地主张和平，我们对于维护世界和平的伟大事业，积极地尽了我们所能尽的责任，并且取得了重大的胜利；同时，在另一方面，我们决不怕战争，尤其决不会以自己的领土去乞求和平，这更是坚定不移的。但是美国侵略集团却一直不顾全世界人民的谴责，奉行战争冒险政策，尤其最近以来，更加猖狂地阻挠我们解放台湾的正义行动，并以原子武器来威胁爱好和平的人民。解放台湾是我们国家的内政，决不容许美帝国主义横加干涉，台湾一定要解放，不胜利决不罢休。目前原子战争的威胁，已经激起了全世界人民极大的愤怒，反对战争的力量正在迅速壮大，我们相信，在全世界爱好和平人民的一致反对下，美帝国主义正准备以原子武器来屠杀人类的罪恶阴谋，必然要像决议中所说的归于失败。
    我们坚决要求使原子能用在和平建设事业上，像先进的苏联人民已经为和平利用原子能开辟了光辉道路并取得了重大成就那样，永远为人类的幸福而服务。
