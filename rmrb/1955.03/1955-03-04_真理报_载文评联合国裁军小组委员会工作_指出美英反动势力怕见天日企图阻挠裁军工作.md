Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd: The "Truth Daily" published on March 1st a short commentary by Vasilyev, entitled "Those Who Fear the Light of Day."

The article reads: On February 25th, the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee began its work in London. According to the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the task of this subcommittee is to once again seek agreement on the reduction of armaments and armed forces, as well as the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

As everyone knows, a few days before the Subcommittee began its work, on February 18th, the Soviet government issued a statement proposing that all countries undertake the following obligations: completely destroy existing stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen weapons, so that atomic raw materials can only be used for peaceful purposes; not increase the size of their armed forces and armaments beyond the level of January 1, 1955, and establish appropriate international supervision. The Soviet Union also proposed convening a world conference this year to discuss universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

This statement by the Soviet government has been widely known and has received sympathy and support from all who cherish the cause of peace. However, this proposal by the Soviet government has once again triggered a fit of frenzy among the reactionary figures in Washington and London.

On the day after the Subcommittee's first meeting, American and British newspapers clamored, saying that "the Russians had undermined" the "rules of secrecy" of the Subcommittee's work, which the Western countries were striving to maintain. The reason given was that news had been published stating that the Soviet delegation had put forward proposals based on the Soviet government's statement of February 18th. However, the Soviet government's position on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons was clearly stated in its official statement, and this official statement was by no means a secret. As for the position of the Western countries, they are obviously unwilling to announce it publicly and want to keep it secret. Now, the impression is being created that the Western countries harbor an intention to fear the light of day in the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee. The reactionary forces in Washington and London are active, attempting to complicate the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee and obstruct substantive discussions on those extremely important issues that are related to the interests of the people of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 3rd: A communiqué was issued here on the evening of March 1st. The communiqué stated that the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee meeting was held at Lancaster House on March 1st. The meeting was chaired by the US representative, Lodge. Negotiations continued at the meeting. The next meeting will be held on March 3rd.

    “真理报”载文评联合国裁军小组委员会工作
    指出美英反动势力怕见天日企图阻挠裁军工作
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：三月一日“真理报”刊载了瓦西里耶夫写的一篇短评，题目是“怕见天日的人”。
    文章写道：二月二十五日，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦开始工作了。按照联合国大会的决议，这一小组委员会的任务是再一次谋求在裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器问题上达成协议。
    大家知道，在小组委员会开始工作前几天，在二月十八日，苏联政府发表声明建议各国承担下列义务：完全销毁现在储存的原子武器和氢武器，使原子原料只能被用于和平用途；不得使自己的武装部队和军备的数量增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，建立适当的国际监督。苏联并且建议在今年召开一次讨论普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的世界会议。
    苏联政府的这一声明已普遍地为大家所知道，并且得到一切珍视和平事业的人的同情和支持。但是，苏联政府的这一建议又一次引起了华盛顿和伦敦的反动人物疯狂病的发作。
    就在小组委员会第一次会议的次日，美国和英国的报纸就叫嚷起来，说什么“俄国人破坏了”西方国家竭力坚持的小组委员会工作的“保密规则”。理由是报纸上登出了关于苏联代表团提出了以苏联政府二月十八日的声明为基础的建议这样的新闻。但是，苏联政府在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题上的立场在它的官方声明中明明白白地说清楚了，而这一官方声明绝不是什么秘密。至于西方国家的立场，它们显然是不愿意公开宣布的，而要保密起来。现在令人产生一种印象：西方国家在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的工作中怀有一种怕见天日的意图。华盛顿和伦敦的反动势力正在活动，他们企图使联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的工作复杂化，企图阻挠切实地讨论同各国人民利益攸关的那些极其重大的问题。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：三月一日晚，此间发表了公报。公报说，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议三月一日在兰开斯特大厦举行。会议由美国代表洛奇担任主席。会上继续进行谈判。下一次会议将在三月三日举行。
