Farmers in Longyan Prefecture, Fujian Province, are actively improving their soil, with a total planned improvement of 350,000 mu. Once this plan is realized, it is estimated that the annual increase in rice production will be 8.4 million jin, equivalent to the total yield of 30,000 mu of paddy fields in the area for one season.

Currently, soil improvement work in many areas is actively underway. Last winter, the entire region planted more than 31,000 mu of green manure crops such as *feitianzi* and hairy vetch, and more than 200,000 mu of broad beans, peas, wheat, and barley. Farmers are preparing to turn the green manure, as well as the stems and leaves of broad beans and peas after harvesting, and the straw of wheat and barley into the fields to improve the soil. The majority of villages have widely launched a campaign to dig pond mud and shovel turf. According to incomplete statistics from 439 townships in six counties, including Wuping, Zhangping, Shanghang, Liancheng, Changting, and Yongding, more than 2.17 million dan of pond mud, turf, and plant ash have been accumulated. The Qiu Wenke mutual aid team in Huangdian Township, Shanghang, mobilized 160 people to dig out the pond mud from a large pond that had not been dug for 30 years.

Most of the farmland in Longyan Prefecture has poor soil quality and low yields. Over the years, many local farmers have used various methods to improve the soil and have achieved significant yield increases. In 1954, Wuping County improved 20,000 mu of soil, generally increasing yields by 40% to 50%, with the highest increase reaching 100%. In 1954, Longyan County improved 2,000 mu of soil, with an average increase of about 30 jin of grain per mu compared to the past.

    龙岩农民大力改良土壤
    福建省龙岩专区各地农民积极改良土壤，他们共计划改良土壤三十五万亩。这个计划实现后，预计全年可增产稻谷八百四十万斤，相当于当地三万亩水稻田一季的总产量。
    目前，许多地区的改良土壤工作正在积极进行。全区去年冬种了肥田子、苕子等绿肥三万一千多亩、蚕豆、豌豆和小麦、大麦二十多万亩；农民们准备把绿肥和收获后的蚕豌豆茎叶、小麦和大麦的麦秆翻入田中，以改良土壤。大部分乡村已较普遍地掀起了挖塘泥、铲草皮的运动。据武平、漳平、上杭、连城、长汀、永定六个县四百三十九个乡不完全统计，已积有塘泥、草皮、草木灰等两百十七万多担。上杭黄甸乡丘文科互助组出动了一百六十个人，把三十年来一直没有挖过的一口大池塘里的塘泥都挖了出来。
    龙岩专区大部分田土质瘦、产量低。历年来，当地不少农民利用多种办法改良土壤，都获得了显著的增产效果。一九五四年，武平县改良土壤两万亩，一般的都增产百分之四十到五十，最高的增产达一倍。龙岩县一九五四年改良土壤两千亩，每亩田平均比过去增产谷子三十斤左右。
