Xinhua News Agency:

    Sichuan Province's 4.8 million mu of rapeseed has already formed pods and will be ready for harvest in half a month. Barring unforeseen disasters, it is estimated that the province will be able to complete its plan to increase rapeseed production by 19 percent compared to 1954. Farmers in various regions are currently tidying up threshing grounds and preparing for the harvest.
    Sichuan Province ranks first in the country in rapeseed production. Thanks to farmers' use of improved varieties and improved farming techniques, this year's rapeseed plants throughout the province are generally strong and robust with fewer diseases. In the major producing area of the western Sichuan Plain, rapeseed plants laden with pods sway in the spring breeze, presenting a scene of abundant harvest.

    四川省油菜可望丰收
    四川省四百八十多万亩油菜已经结荚，半个多月后即可收割。如无意外灾害，估计全省油菜籽比一九五四年增产百分之十九的计划可望完成。目前各地农民正在收拾晒场，从事收割的准备。
    四川省的油菜籽产量居全国第一位。由于农民采用良种和改进耕作技术，今年全省油菜一般株壮实多，病害较少。在主要产区川西平原上，到处是结满果实的油菜迎着春风摆动，呈现出丰收的景象。（新华社）
