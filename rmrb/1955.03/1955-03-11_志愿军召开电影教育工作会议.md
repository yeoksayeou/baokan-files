    The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently convened the Third Film Education Work Conference for the entire army. The conference summarized the achievements and experiences of the army's film education work in 1954 and planned the work for 1955.
    In 1954, the film education teams of the Volunteer Army's various units universally adopted the advanced working method of "zonal screenings" and launched a "Three Goods" (good screening technology, good publicity effect, and good maintenance of machines and films) competition. They screened films a total of more than 28,390 times during the year, increasing the proportion of the total number of officers and soldiers in the entire army watching films an average of twice a month from about 50 percent in 1953 to 85 percent, enabling units performing decentralized tasks to see a film an average of once a month. After watching the films, many company-level cadres and soldiers also held informal discussions, discussions, or published their thoughts on wall newspapers.

    志愿军召开电影教育工作会议
    中国人民志愿军政治部最近召开了全军第三届电影教育工作会议。会议总结了一九五四年全军电影教育工作的成绩和经验，并布置了一九五五年的工作。
    志愿军各部队的电影教育队在一九五四年中普遍采用了“划区放映”的先进工作方法，并开展了“三好”（放映技术好、宣传效果好、机器和影片保养好）竞赛。它们在一年中共放映电影二万八千三百九十多场次，使全军指战员平均每月观看两次电影的人占全体人数的比例，由一九五三年的百分之五十左右增加到百分之八十五，使分散执行任务的部队平均每月也能够看到一次电影。很多连队的干部、战士在看完电影后还进行了漫谈、讨论，或在墙报上发表自己的感想。（新华社）
