Song Guoming Suppresses Workers' Criticism

To the Editors:

    On January 29th, the workers of our factory wrote a letter to Comrade Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The gist of the letter was: "In June 1954, our factory responded to the Party's call and launched a technical innovation campaign. All the machines in our factory, through the efforts and research of Factory Director (and Party Branch Secretary) Wei Yongyan, have become automated. This can increase the country's production by as much as 1.5 billion yuan (old currency) a year. At the same time, the workers are no longer subjected to the suffering of smoke and high temperatures, or strenuous labor. Therefore, when evaluating the factory's model workers this time, we all selected Factory Director Wei Yongyan. When awarding the prize, we also wrote a congratulatory letter, wishing him to become a model worker in Beijing. But later, someone played tricks and turned Factory Director Wei Yongyan's achievements into someone else's. We believe the leadership should clarify this matter..."

    Soon, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China forwarded this anonymous letter to the Fengtai District Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Fengtai District Committee then transferred the letter to Song Guoming, the Deputy Secretary of our factory's Party Branch. Logically, after receiving this letter, Song Guoming should have examined his own work and improved his shortcomings based on the letter. Unfortunately, he did not do this. Instead, he collected many workers' notes and wall newspaper drafts, checking the handwriting one by one, trying to find the letter writer in order to attack and retaliate. After failing to identify the handwriting, he used threats to interrogate the workers. He first threatened the group leader, Jiang Zhixia, saying, "The letter was written by workers in your workshop. You must be responsible for finding out who wrote it." Then, he personally took the letter to worker Zhao Qingxiang and said, "Have you written a letter to anyone? Who asked you to write it?" Zhao Qingxiang was frightened and burst into tears. In order to track down the writer of the letter, Song Guoming questioned Peng Enqi three times. He threatened Peng Enqi, saying, "Today is your chance to confess. It will not be good for you if you don't speak up." "Your notes and application to join the Party have been sent to the court. Judging from the handwriting, you wrote that letter. Tell me quickly." Song Guoming repeatedly threatened and pressed several workers.

    We believe that Song Guoming's above actions are suppression of democracy and a serious illegal act of attacking and retaliating against those who make suggestions. The relevant leadership should investigate this matter and deal with it seriously.

    宋国明压制工人批评编辑同志：
    一月二十九日，我们厂的工人给中共北京市委员会副书记刘仁同志写了一封信，大意是：“我们工厂在一九五四年六月响应了党的号召，开展了技术革新运动，我们工厂所有的机器经过魏永言厂长（兼党支部书记）的努力和研究，都变成自动化了，一年可以给国家增产十五亿元之多（旧币），同时，工人们也再不受烟熏火烤和费大力气的痛苦了。所以在这次评选厂劳动模范时，我们都选了魏永言厂长，在发奖时，我们还写了贺信，祝他成为北京市的劳动模范。但是后来，不知道什么人在这里边变了戏法，把魏永言厂长的成绩变成别人的了，我们认为领导上要把这件事弄个清楚……”
    不久，中共北京市委员会把这封匿名信转到了中共丰台区委员会，丰台区委员会又把信转到了我厂党支部副书记宋国明的手里。照理，宋国明在接到这封信以后，应该根据这封信来检查自己的工作，改进工作缺点。可惜他没有这样做，反而把很多工人的笔记和墙报稿子都搜集起来，一个一个地查对笔迹，企图从中发现写信人，进行打击和报复。在查对笔迹无效后，就用威胁的手段对工人进行追问。他首先威胁组长姜志霞说：“信是你车间工人写的，你必须负责查出来。”接着并亲自拿着信对工人赵庆祥说：“你给谁写了信没有，是谁叫你写的？”赵庆祥被吓得目瞪口呆，痛哭流涕。宋国明为了追查那封信的写信人，先后向彭恩起追问了三次，他用威胁的口吻对彭恩起说：“今天是你表白的机会，不谈出来对你是没有好处的。”“你的笔记和入党志愿书已送到法院去了，从笔迹上看，那封信就是你写的，赶快说出来。”宋国明接连威吓和追逼了好几个工人。
    我们认为宋国明上述举动是压制民主，是对提意见的人进行打击报复的严重违法行为，有关领导方面应该对这件事进行检查和严肃的处理。  孙翰才　彭恩起
