    Unilateral Actions Violating the Geneva Accords
    Hu Jin
    Just as the Bangkok conference concluded, the U.S. State Department revealed that the United States was planning to convene a high-level tripartite meeting with the U.K. and France regarding the Indochina issue. Now, French Foreign Minister Pinay has confirmed that holding this meeting has been "decided in principle."
    Simultaneously, Dulles stated at a press conference on the 15th that the United States would also hold bilateral high-level talks with France to discuss the Indochina issue.
    News confirms that this is yet another new conspiracy by the United States, aimed at dragging the U.K. and France along with it to further undermine the Geneva Accords.
    It must be pointed out that the convening of a meeting on the Indochina issue by the U.S., U.K., and France in itself is a unilateral action that violates the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords. As everyone knows, the final declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulated the obligations of the participating countries to collectively guarantee peace in Indochina and the implementation of the various agreements. The U.S. government refused to participate in the Geneva Accords at the time, ostensibly to preserve its freedom of action to undermine the agreements. But at the same time, it also declared: "The United States will not use threat or force to disturb these agreements and clauses." As for the U.K. and France, they signed the Geneva Accords, and the U.K. was also one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference. Holding unilateral meetings on the Indochina issue behind the backs of other signatory countries to the Geneva Accords is clearly incompatible with the obligations they have undertaken.
    According to Western news agency reports, the primary goal of the United States in convening the tripartite meeting is to undermine the general elections in the three Indochinese countries. This is certainly no secret. In his speech on March 8th, Dulles openly stated that the United States wanted to replay in Vietnam the trick it used to obstruct the reunification of Korea and Germany through elections. He shamelessly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, saying that "it would be difficult to create conditions in the North where people can have a real choice of freedom." Everyone can see that this is Dulles creating a pretext for the United States to obstruct the general elections in Vietnam. At the same time, the United States is also trying every means to undermine the general elections in Laos and Cambodia. The United States recently created the excuse that the International Supervisory and Control Commission "interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs," attempting to drive the International Commission out of Cambodia and undermine the general elections in Cambodia. In Laos, the United States has even instigated and dispatched armed bandits to attack the assembly areas of the Lao Patriotic Forces, attempting to fundamentally undermine the ceasefire there.
    The United States' intensified interference in the internal affairs of Indochina and its conspiracy to deprive the people of Indochina of their independence, freedom, and democratic rights are aimed at thoroughly undermining the Geneva Accords, turning Indochina into a U.S. military base, so as to intensify tensions in Asia and prepare for a new war. This endangers the fundamental interests of the people of Indochina and the people of Asia, and therefore cannot be tolerated by the people of Indochina, all peace-loving people, and all countries willing to respect and fulfill the Geneva Accords.
    According to an AFP report on the 16th, French Prime Minister Faure stated that France "will firmly abide by the international agreements that France has signed" and hold general elections in Vietnam in July 1956. This is the position that the French government should take. Despite this, France is still following the United States in holding the so-called tripartite meeting, attempting to unilaterally handle the Indochina issue. This directly contradicts its promise to abide by the Geneva Accords. The Faure government should know that this contradictory stance will certainly not be beneficial to France.
    French Foreign Minister Pinay also said that the tripartite meeting would also discuss the issue of France's withdrawal from Haiphong. This is also a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords. According to the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, the French Union forces should completely withdraw from the Haiphong area before May of this year. This is one of the important clauses for maintaining the ceasefire in Indochina. But the United States is clearly attempting to undermine the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, preventing the withdrawal from Haiphong, in order to seize this important port. The French Union forces have not only colluded with the United States to loot public property in Haiphong and force Haiphong residents to evacuate, but also followed the United States' intentions and deliberately obstructed the work of the Haiphong area transfer working group of the Joint Ceasefire Commission, causing negotiations to progress very slowly so far. All of this is extremely contrary to the Geneva Accords. Any obstruction of the Haiphong withdrawal work by the tripartite meeting will seriously threaten the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and cause extremely adverse consequences. The Chinese people firmly express their opposition.
    It is clear that the United Kingdom closely follows the United States, and France constantly succumbs to the United States' policy of supplanting it in Indochina. This allows the United States to increasingly recklessly carry out interference and sabotage activities in Indochina, creating a dangerous situation in Indochina. This practice of France and the United Kingdom can only be regarded as their preparation to share the serious responsibility with the United States for creating the Indochina situation and undermining the Geneva Accords.

    违反日内瓦协议的片面行动
    胡今
    曼谷会议刚刚结束，美国国务院就透露出，美国要策划召开美英法三国关于印度支那问题的高级会议。现在，法国外交部长比内证实，召开这个会议“已在原则上决定”。
    同时，杜勒斯在十五日记者招待会上说，美国还要同法国举行双边高级会谈，讨论印度支那问题。
    消息证明，这是美国又一新的阴谋，目的是要想拉着英法两国同它一道，进一步破坏日内瓦协议。
    必须指出，美、英、法三国召开关于印度支那问题的会议本身，就是一种违反日内瓦协议的精神和文字的片面行动。大家知道，日内瓦会议最后宣言，明明白白地规定了与会各国集体保证印度支那和平及各项协定实施的义务。美国政府当时拒绝参加日内瓦协议，显然是为了保留它破坏协议的行动自由。但同时它也曾声明：“美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害这些协定和条款。”至于英法两国，则是在日内瓦协议上签了字的，英国并且是日内瓦会议的主席之一。它们背着日内瓦协议的其他签字国举行有关印度支那问题的片面会议，显然同它们所承担的义务不能相容。
    根据西方通讯社的消息，美国召开三国会议的首要目的，是破坏印度支那三国的普选。这当然不是什么秘密。杜勒斯在三月八日的演说中，就已公开表明，美国要把它阻挠朝鲜和德国人民经过选举实现国家统一的伎俩，搬到越南来重演。他竟恬不知耻地诽谤越南民主共和国，说什么“要在北部创造可以让人们有真正选择的自由的条件会是困难的。”谁都看得见，这是杜勒斯在为美国阻挠越南普选制造口实。同时，美国也正在千方百计地破坏在老挝和柬埔寨的普选。美国最近就曾制造所谓国际监督和监察委员会“干涉了柬埔寨的内政”的藉口，企图把国际委员会赶出柬埔寨，破坏柬埔寨的普选。在老挝，美国更指使和派遣武装匪徒进攻寮国战斗部队集结区，企图根本破坏那里的停战。
    美国变本加厉地干涉印度支那内政，阴谋剥夺印度支那人民的独立、自由和民主权利的活动，是为了彻底破坏日内瓦协议，把印度支那变为美国的军事基地，以便加剧亚洲紧张局势，准备新战争。这危害印度支那人民和亚洲人民的根本利益，因而是印度支那人民、各国爱好和平人民和一切愿意尊重和履行日内瓦协议的国家所决不能容许的。
    据法新社十六日消息，法国总理富尔表示，法国“将坚定地遵守法国已经签字的国际协定”，在一九五六年七月在越南举行普选。这是法国政府应有的立场。尽管如此，法国却又要跟随美国举行所谓三国会议，企图片面处理印度支那问题。这就同它表示愿意遵守日内瓦协议的诺言直接抵触。富尔政府应该知道，这种矛盾立场当然不会对法国有利。
    法国外交部长比内还说，三国会议还要讨论关于法国撤退海防的问题。这也是对日内瓦协议的公然违反。根据越南停止敌对行动协定的规定，法兰西联邦部队应在今年五月以前完全撤出海防地区。这是维护印度支那停战的重要条款之一。但美国显然企图破坏越南停止敌对行动协定，阻止海防的撤退，以便夺取这个重要港口。法兰西联邦部队方面不仅串通美国劫运海防公共财产，强迫海防居民撤退，而且遵奉美国的意旨，故意阻挠联合停战委员会海防地区移交工作小组委员会的工作，使谈判至今进展很慢。这都是极为违反日内瓦协定的。三国会议任何对于海防撤退工作的阻挠行为，都将严重威胁停战协定的实施，并引起极其不良的后果。中国人民坚决表示反对。
    很明显，英国紧紧追随美国，法国不断地向美国在印度支那取而代之的政策屈服，这就使美国日益放肆地在印度支那进行干涉和破坏活动，制造印度支那的危险局势。法国和英国的这种做法，只能被认为它们准备替美国分担制造印度支那局势、破坏日内瓦协议的严重责任。
