Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 13th: According to TASS, the Federal Court in Foley Square, New York, continues to hear the appeal filed by the defense lawyers of thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, requesting a retrial. The reason for the appeal is that one of the key witnesses for the prosecution in the original case, a member of the FBI, and a "Communist expert" hired by the US Department of Justice, Matthew Mato, has publicly admitted that he was instructed by Roy Cohn, Assistant Attorney General of the US Department of Justice, one of the plaintiffs in the case, to present false evidence during the trial of these thirteen individuals.

During the Foley Square Court's hearing on the retrial appeal, Mato once again admitted that the evidence he presented against the thirteen leaders of the Communist Party was false. He said that this evidence was prepared in advance by Roy Cohn in a question-and-answer format. The typed manuscripts of these questions and answers have been submitted to the court. Mato memorized these questions and answers according to Cohn's orders. Blind, who served as the Second Assistant Attorney General during the trial of the thirteen, testified in court that the handwriting on these manuscripts was Cohn's.

However, despite Mato's confession having overturned the main "basis" for the prosecution of the thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party, these thirteen individuals continue to be held in prison, and the state prosecutors are currently doing everything possible to obstruct the retrial of their case.

In order to cover up the scandal caused by the Mato incident, the US authorities are now attempting to intimidate Mato to prevent him from telling the truth.

However, nothing can diminish the profound impression that the Mato incident has created in public opinion. The "New York Times" editorial on March 10th admitted that the whole country is protesting against "the Department of Justice and other government agencies using hired informers."

The newspaper cited several facts to prove that Mato is just one of many false witnesses that the US authorities have used in the past and continue to use to persecute progressive parties and organizations in the United States.

"The Progressive" magazine wrote not long ago that the Immigration and Naturalization Service alone has thirty-five hired personnel, and another fifty false witnesses in other professions work for the Department of Justice. They testify in court trials and congressional committee hearings and receive twenty-five dollars a day.

"The Nation" magazine has published the names of many of these police pawns. "New York Herald Tribune" commentator Stewart Alsop pointed out that Paul Crouch, one of the aforementioned individuals mentioned by "The Nation," had testified in court in sixty cases. His lies were exposed when he testified in the cases of progressive union activists Harry Bridges, Jean Cobb Baker, and the victims of the Smith Act in Philadelphia. Another person, Hiewitt, was also accused of providing false testimony, but this case was "settled quietly" and was not tried. The perjury of a hired informer named Manning Johnson, also mentioned by "The Nation," was also exposed, but he was able to avoid legal responsibility.

"The Daily Worker" wrote, "Even though conservatives are increasingly disgusted with these provocative actions, the Department of Justice continues to defend these individuals in order to retain the entire method of using false witnesses to persecute those parties and individuals who hold opinions that the Department of Justice does not tolerate."

    美国报刊继续暴露美政府利用假证人迫害进步人士的事实
    美共十三领导人请求重审的申诉受到阻挠
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约十三日讯：纽约福莱广场联邦法院继续审理美国共产党领导者伊丽莎白·弗林等十三人的辩护律师提出的要求重审这十三个人的案件的申诉。提出申诉的理由是：这一案件原告主要见证人之一、联邦调查局的人员、美国司法部雇佣的“共产主义专家”马图索已公开承认，他曾经受原告人之一、美国司法部助理检查官罗伊·柯恩的指示，在这十三个人的案件的审讯过程中提出了假证。
    在福莱广场法院审理重审申诉过程中，马图索再次承认他对共产党十三位领导人案件提出的证据是假的。他说，这些证据是罗伊·柯恩当时事先以问答形式准备好的。这些问答的打字稿已交给法院。马图索就是根据柯恩的命令把这些问答背熟。曾在十三人案的审讯中担任第二助理检查官布林德在法庭上证明，这些稿子上的字迹是柯恩的手笔。
    可是，尽管马图索的供认已经使控告美共十三个领袖的主要“根据”被推翻，这十三个人仍然被继续关在监狱里，而且目前国家公诉人千方百计地阻挠重审他们的案件。
    为了掩饰马图索事件所引起的丑闻，美国当局现在企图恫吓马图索，不许他坦白。
    但是，任何东西也不能削弱马图索事件在舆论中造成的深刻印象。“纽约时报”三月十日的社论承认，全国都在抗议“司法部和政府其他机关利用被雇佣的告密者”。
    报纸援引了一些事实证明，马图索不过是许多假证人之一，美国当局过去利用，而且继续在利用这些假证人来迫害美国的进步党派和组织。
      “进步”杂志不久以前写道：单是移民归化局就有三十五名被雇佣的人员，另外有五十名其他职业的假证人在司法部中工作，他们在法庭审讯和国会各委员会审讯中作证，每天获得二十五块美元。
      “民族”周刊曾经发表过这些警察爪牙中的许多人的名字。“纽约先锋论坛报”评论员斯图尔特·艾尔索普指出，“民族”周刊所提的上述人员之一保罗·克劳契就曾在六十个案件中出庭作证，当他在审讯进步工会活动家哈里·布里治、让科布·贝尔克和费城史密斯法受害人的案件出庭作证时，他的谎话被揭穿了。另一个人员希尤特也因提供伪证而被控告，但是这个案件“暗中了结了”，并没有审理。“民族”周刊所提到的一个雇佣告密者曼宁格·杨逊的伪证也被揭穿了，但是他却能够免负法律责任。
      “工人日报”写道，“尽管连保守人士也对这些挑衅行动日益表示反感，司法部仍然继续维护这些人，以便保留运用假证人这一整套的方法来迫害那些抱有司法部所不容许的见解的政党和个人。”
