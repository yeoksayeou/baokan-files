Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th: "Pravda" published an article by Mayevsky entitled "The Conspiracies of Those Who Sabotage International Agreements."

The article states that a few days ago, the U.S. State Department released two volumes of so-called "documents" regarding the Crimea Conference held by the heads of the three major powers. One might ask, why would the State Department retrieve a pile of materials from dusty archives—materials containing unrestrained conversations, many of which have no significance now? Most commentators agree that the considerations of the struggle between domestic factions in the United States prompted the State Department to do so.

However, this is only one aspect of the issue. The other aspect is related to the political plans of reactionary forces in the United States abroad.

The universally known and historically significant decisions reached at the Crimea Conference played a tremendous role in the victory of the anti-Hitler alliance in World War II. At the same time, they served as the foundation for effective cooperation among the three major powers after the war, based on the interests of peace and international security. However, the U.S. ruling circles abandoned the idea of international cooperation after the war and declared a "policy backed by strength." Their goal was not to strive for a consolidated and lasting peace but to seize world hegemony. The aggressive policy of the United States directly violated the letter and spirit of international agreements. Recently, a movement against the Yalta Agreement was launched in the United States. The notorious Senator McCarthy introduced a proposal in Congress demanding that the United States formally abolish the Yalta Agreement and all obligations undertaken by the United States under this agreement.

The proposal recalls that the Republican Party's 1952 campaign platform called for the abolition of this agreement. Republican Senator Butler also demanded the abandonment of the Yalta Agreement in a letter to Dulles.

McCarthy's enthusiasm on the issue of the Crimea Conference decisions is entirely understandable, and it makes the true intentions behind the release of these so-called "documents" even clearer. The McCarthyites are trying to launch an "anti-communist" movement around these so-called "documents" of the Yalta Conference. The State Department is also participating in this movement because it is entirely in line with the goals and tasks of the U.S. government. The U.S. government is desperately trying to discredit the conference in order to find an excuse to abolish the decisions of the Crimea Conference.

Everyone can clearly see that this is a path leading to increased international tension. The U.S. rulers are trying to undermine the reputation of the Crimea Conference, which is also an attempt to make people doubt the very idea of holding great-power negotiations, thereby hindering the relaxation of international tension. This is the true meaning of the release of these so-called "documents" and the clamor made by the reactionary newspapers surrounding this matter.

    破坏国际协定的人们的阴谋
    ——“真理报”发表的马耶夫斯基的文章的摘要
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”发表了马耶夫斯基的一篇文章，题目是“破坏国际协定的人们的阴谋”。
    文章写道，几天前，美国国务院公布了两卷关于三大国首脑举行的克里米亚会议的所谓“文件”。人们可能要问，国务院为什么要从盖满灰尘的档案中拿出一堆其中许多在现在已经没有任何意义的记录没有拘束的谈话的材料来呢？大多数评论家一致认为，是美国国内党派之间的斗争的考虑促使国务院这样做的。
    但是，这只是问题的一方面。问题的另一方面是同美国反动势力在国外的政治计划有关的。
    克里米亚会议上达成的举世皆知的具有历史意义的决定，对于反希特勒联盟在第二次世界大战中取得胜利起了巨大的作用。同时，它们曾经是三大国在战后根据和平和国际安全的利益进行有效的合作的基础。但是，美国统治集团抛弃了战后进行国际合作的主张，而宣布了“以实力为后盾的政策”。他们的目标不是争取巩固和持久的和平，而是夺取世界霸权。美国的侵略政策直接违反了国际协定的文字和精神。最近在美国发动了一个反对雅尔塔协定的运动。臭名昭彰的参议员麦卡锡在国会提出了一个提案，要求美国正式废除雅尔塔协定以及美国根据这个协定承担的一切义务。
    这个提案追述说，共和党在一九五二年提出的竞选纲领曾经要求废除这个协定。共和党参议员巴特勒在致杜勒斯的一封信中也要求废弃雅尔塔协定。
    麦卡锡在克里米亚会议的决定的问题上表现出来的热心是完全可以理解的，而且也使得这次公布所谓“文件”的真正意图更加清楚地暴露出来了。麦卡锡分子试图围绕这些所谓雅尔塔会议的“文件”发动一个“反共”运动。国务院也参加了这个运动，因为这个运动同美国政府的目的和任务是完全符合的。美国政府为了替它废除克里米亚会议的决定寻找借口，正竭力设法诬蔑这次会议。
    人人都可以清楚地看到这是一条导致国际紧张局势加剧的道路。美国统治者们试图破坏克里米亚会议的名声，也就是想使人们对举行大国谈判这种主张本身发生怀疑，从而阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。这就是公布这些所谓“文件”和反动报纸围绕这件事情发出的叫嚣的真正意义。
