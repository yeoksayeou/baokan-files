The Central Academy of Fine Arts has basically eliminated the phenomenon of spilling grain.

Every year, this school sends a group of students to the countryside for internships. They live with the farmers, learn farming from them, and appreciate the value of grain through labor. After returning to school, they not only stopped wasting grain themselves, but also actively fought against the phenomenon of wasting grain. In the summer of 1954, when the cooks found half a steamed bun in the garbage, a group of students who had just returned from their rural internships were very angry. They suggested putting the bun in a prominent place in the dining hall for everyone to comment on. As a result, many people offered their opinions, and a trend of cherishing food was established throughout the school.

However, as time went on, the phenomenon of spilling grain continued to occur. After President Jiang Feng delivered a mobilization report on saving food on March 5 this year, a new wave of enthusiasm for saving food swept through the school. The cooks put forward various methods to ensure that not a single grain of rice was wasted. They found that they had not been shaking the flour sacks clean in the past. Now, after emptying each bag of flour, they can still shake out half an ounce of flour. By paying attention to avoiding spillage when washing rice every day, they can reduce the loss by six ounces of rice. They can also save eight ounces of rice per day by utilizing leftover rice. The students also spontaneously launched challenges and made various guarantees to save food. These guarantees were posted in front of the dining hall. On a challenge letter signed by all the students of the second year, class B of the painting department, specific guarantees were made, such as "take as much as you can eat," "don't drop rice grains when serving and eating," and "finish eating before washing the dishes." The student union is summarizing the various guarantees made by the students and formulating a dining hall code of conduct. In addition, the catering group posted a note in front of the dining hall soliciting suggestions for saving food, and many specific opinions have already been written on the note.

### 中央美术学院基本消除抛撒米粒现象

    中央美术学院基本消除抛撒米粒现象
    中央美术学院已基本上消除了抛撒米粒的现象。
    这个学校每年都有一批学生下乡实习。他们和农民一起生活，学习农民耕种，从劳动中体会到粮食的珍贵。回到学校后，他们不仅自己再不抛撒粮食了，并积极和抛撒粮食的现象斗争。一九五四年夏天，炊事员发现垃圾堆里有半个馒头，当时，一批刚从农村实习后回校的学生看了，都很生气，建议把馒头放在饭厅醒目的地方，让大家提意见，结果很多人都提了意见，全校从此便树立了爱惜粮食的风气。
    可是，日子长了，抛撒米粒的现象仍不断发生。江丰院长在今年三月五日作了节约粮食的动员报告以后，全校重又掀起节约粮食的热潮。炊事员们提出了各种办法，保证不浪费一粒米。他们发现过去没有把面粉袋抖干净，现在每袋面粉倒光后，还可以抖出半两面粉；每天在淘米时注意避免抛撒，可以少损失六两米；在利用剩饭方面每天也可以节省八两米。学生们更自发地展开了挑战应战，提出各种节约粮食的保证，这些保证书都张贴在饭厅门前。在绘画系二年级乙班全体学生签名的一张应战书上，具体地提出了使多少，拿多少，盛饭、吃饭不掉米粒，吃光再洗碗等具体的保证。学生会正在把同学们提出的各种保证归纳起来，制订一个饭厅公约。此外，伙食团在饭厅门前贴了一张征求节约粮食办法的纸条，纸条上已有人写了好些具体意见。
