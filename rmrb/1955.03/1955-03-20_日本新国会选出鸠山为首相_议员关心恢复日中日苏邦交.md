Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: Following the recent general election, Japan's new Diet convened on the 18th. The meeting elected Ichiro Hatoyama, president of the Democratic Party, as Prime Minister on the same day to form a new cabinet. This session will continue until the end of June.

At the opening of the Diet, the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives was as follows: Democratic Party 185 seats, Liberal Party 114 seats, Left-wing Socialist Party 89 seats, Right-wing Socialist Party 67 seats, Labor-Farmer Party 4 seats, Communist Party 2 seats, minor parties and independents 6 seats.

Ichiro Hatoyama was re-elected as Prime Minister with the support of the majority of Liberal Party members in the House of Representatives. He formed his second Democratic Party cabinet on the 19th. The new cabinet largely maintains the line-up of the original cabinet. Mamoru Shigemitsu continues to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Among all the important cabinet members, only the Director-General of the "Defense Agency" has been replaced by Arata Sugihara, Chairman of the Democratic Party's Special Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Although the Liberal Party supported the Democratic Party in forming the cabinet, it tried its best to maintain its power in the Diet in order to restrain the Democratic Party's cabinet. Despite the prior agreement between the two conservative parties on the distribution of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Liberal Party refused to support the Democratic Party's candidate for Speaker during the election. As a result, Hideji Masutani of the Liberal Party was elected Speaker, and Motojiro Sugiyama of the Right-wing Socialist Party was elected Vice-Speaker. Many sources indicate that the fact that both speakerships are controlled by opposition parties will cause great difficulties for the second Hatoyama cabinet in the Diet in the future.

The main issues to be discussed at this Diet session include foreign policy and the national budget. Tokyo political observers pointed out that the issue of normalizing relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union is of greatest concern to the legislators. After Ichiro Hatoyama formed his second cabinet, the left and right-wing Socialist parties issued a joint statement saying that they would do their utmost to urge the Hatoyama cabinet to implement the promises it made during the election.

    日本新国会选出鸠山为首相
    议员关心恢复日中日苏邦交
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：最近大选后产生的日本新国会在十八日召开会议。会议在当天选出民主党总裁鸠山一郎为首相，组织新的内阁。这次会议将一直举行到六月底。
    在国会开会时，众议院议席的分配如下：民主党一百八十五席，自由党一百一十四席，左派社会党八十九席，右派社会党六十七席，劳农党四席，共产党二席，小党派和无党派六席。
    鸠山一郎是在得到众议院大部分自由党议员的支持而再度当选为首相的。他已经在十九日组成了第二次民主党内阁。新内阁基本上保持着原来内阁的阵容。重光葵继续留任副首相兼外务相。在所有的重要阁员中，只有“防卫厅”长官改由民主党外交特别委员会主席杉原荒太担任。
    自由党虽然在组织内阁方面支持了民主党，但是却竭力企图保持自己在国会内的权力，以便牵制民主党的内阁。尽管这两个保守政党事前已经就众议院议长和副议长的分配取得了协议，自由党仍然在选举时拒绝支持民主党的议长候选人。选举结果，自由党人益谷秀次当选为议长，右派社会党人杉山元治郎当选为副议长。许多消息指出：两个议长职都为在野党所控制，将使第二次鸠山内阁今后在国会内遭到很大的困难。
    这次国会会议将要讨论的主要问题有外交政策和国家预算等。东京政治观察家指出：议员们所最关心的问题是日本和中、苏两国关系正常化问题。左、右两派社会党在鸠山一郎组成第二次内阁后发表联合声明说：他们将竭力督促鸠山内阁实行它在竞选时所作的诺言。
