In early March, the fertile banks of the DaXia River in the Linxia region of Gansu Province are already filled with the sights of spring. Farmers of various ethnic groups, including Hui, Han, and Dongxiang, who live along the riverbanks, are happily busy with spring plowing. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are scattered across the vast fields, working on spring planting. Young men hold the plows, singing "Hua'er" tunes as they work; young Hui women, according to custom, wear colorful clothes and green headscarves, closely following behind the plows, breaking up clumps of earth and sowing seeds.

In the villages along the DaXia River, more than seventy new agricultural production cooperatives have been established from last winter to before this spring plowing season, most of which are composed of two or more ethnic groups, including Hui and Han. The farmers of all ethnic groups are particularly enthusiastic about production this year, carrying manure to the fields with lanterns every night before spring plowing. In the past, according to local farming habits, plowing would not begin until after the "Ninth Nine" (referring to the period after the winter solstice), but this year, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams began plowing at the beginning of the "Ninth Nine." Many agricultural production cooperatives, within just three days of starting spring plowing, had already sown two-thirds of their summer fields. Ma Dengke, the Party branch secretary of Gucheng Township in the Xinxiji district of Linxia County, told reporters that six agricultural production cooperatives were established in this township after last autumn, with participating households accounting for 30 percent of the total households in the township. Including mutual aid teams, organized households account for over 86 percent of the township's households. He said, "After the farmers organized, they want to do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest. Before spring plowing, our township's agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams added twenty-seven carts alone."

The reporter visited the New No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative, composed of Hui, Han, and Dongxiang ethnic groups. Before spring plowing, in addition to fully preparing farm tools, fertilizers, and treating seeds with pesticides, they also organized and allocated labor effectively. The original plan was to apply an average of five and a half cartloads of manure per mu (unit of land), but they applied seven cartloads. The entire cooperative also purchased 3,500 jin of oil cake, and the state provided a loan of 1,500 jin of chemical fertilizer. After the spring plowing is completed, they will repair canals and plant trees to create forests. Not far from the New No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative, the members of the Mujiaqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative are equally enthusiastic about production. Cooperative leader Ma Sibei excitedly told the reporter: "Last year, when we were still a mutual aid team, our team's high-yield land yielded more than 600 jin of grain per mu. This year, we established an agricultural production cooperative, used the new water-land drilling method for sowing, and the state has provided loans for improved varieties. The members are all striving for an even greater bumper harvest this year."

    春到大夏河岸
    新华社记者　马玉平
    三月上旬，甘肃省临夏地区富饶的大夏河两岸，已是一片春天的景象。居住在河两岸的回、汉、东乡等各族农民，正以喜悦的心情忙着春耕。广大的田野上散布着农业生产合作社和互助组的春耕队伍。青年男子们掌着?，边劳动边唱着“花儿”；年轻的回族姑娘们，按照习惯穿着花红的衣服，带着绿色的盖头，紧紧跟在?后面，敲打土块和撒种籽。
    沿大夏河两岸各农村里，从去年冬天到今年春耕前，新成立了七十多个农业生产合作社，其中大半是回、汉两个以上民族组成的。各族农民今年的生产劲头特别大，春耕前每天晚上打着灯笼往地里运粪。往年依照当地耕作习惯，“九九”完了才开始耕种，今年“九九”头上，农业生产合作社和互助组就开始耕种了。许多农业生产合作社，春耕开始刚三天，就播种了三分之二的夏田。临夏县新集区古城乡党支部书记马登科告诉记者，这个乡去年秋后成立了六个农业生产合作社，参加的农户已占到全乡总农户的百分之三十，连互助组在内，组织起来的农户已占到全乡农户的百分之八十六以上。他说：“农民们组织起来以后，都要想尽各种办法，争取丰收。春耕前我们乡农业生产合作社和互助组仅添置的大车就有二十七辆。”
    记者访问了由回、汉、东乡三个民族组成的新一号农业生产合作社，他们在春耕前除准备齐全农具、肥料和进行药剂拌种外，还把劳动力组织调配好。原来计划每亩地平均上五车半厩肥，结果上了七车。全社还购置了三千五百斤油渣，国家贷给了一千五百斤化肥。春耕完毕以后，他们就要整修渠道，植树造林。和新一号农业生产合作社相距不远的穆家桥农业生产合作社的社员们生产情绪同样的高，社长马四辈对记者兴奋地说：去年我们还是互助组的时候，组内丰产地每亩收了六百多斤粮食，今年建立了农业生产合作社，使用了新的水地耧播种，国家又贷给了优良品种，社员们都争取今年得到更大的丰收。
