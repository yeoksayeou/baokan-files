Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The Czechoslovak Republic will hold the "Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction of Czechoslovakia" at the Soviet Exhibition Hall in Beijing in April.

This exhibition is the largest exhibition held abroad by the Czechoslovak Republic since its establishment. In order to prepare for this exhibition, the Czechoslovak Republic sent the director of the exhibition, Pok, to Beijing at the end of last December to consult with our country on preparatory matters. The organizational leaders of the various departments of the exhibition, as well as the personnel responsible for the design, installation, and layout of the exhibition, subsequently arrived in Beijing one after another and began the design and layout work of each pavilion. All the exhibits were transported to Beijing in three batches. A total of 4,445 boxes of exhibits have now been transported, including 3,016 boxes of exhibits for decoration, weighing more than 1,820 tons. Among them are heavy-duty machine tools such as large gantry milling machines, SK12 and SK25 vertical lathes, and S1600 lathes, as well as the largest exhibit, a 90-ton F125 crawler excavator. These machines are currently undergoing installation and artistic work. Other exhibits include diesel generators, drilling equipment, precision instruments, motorcycles, and various light industrial products. These exhibits will be displayed in the industrial, agricultural, and cultural pavilions of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, as well as in the two squares. Currently, artistic decoration and machine installation work are being carried out intensively in each pavilion.

This exhibition will play a significant role in further consolidating and developing the friendship between the peoples of China and Czechoslovakia, and in enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples. During the exhibition, Czechoslovak technicians will actually operate and demonstrate various lathes, equipment, and instruments so that the general public can see the specific effectiveness of the exhibits. Technical exchange activities will be conducted during the exhibition, and dozens of Czechoslovak technicians will visit enterprises that have purchased Czechoslovak-made machinery and equipment.
