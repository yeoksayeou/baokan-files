	New Developments in the Signature Campaign Against Atomic Weapons
	Chen Zhuo

	Five years ago today, world peace advocates meeting in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, issued a declaration calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons and calling on all good people around the world to sign this declaration to express their wishes. At that time, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, were frantically expanding their armaments and preparing for a new war in order to delay the approaching economic storm. After the declaration was issued, it was immediately met with enthusiastic responses from people of all countries. The signature campaign demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons quickly swept across the entire world and developed into a large-scale people's movement. More than half a year later, the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw summarized the development scale of the signature campaign: "More than 500 million men and women around the world have signed the Stockholm Declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons to express their will to defend peace."
	The Stockholm Declaration's signature campaign transformed the idea of opposing atomic weapons into a common proposition openly declared by hundreds of millions of people, and united people of all races, genders, and beliefs under the common slogan of defending peaceful life on an unprecedentedly large scale. This powerful will expressed by the unity of hundreds of millions of people around the world has played a huge role in international life, preventing the implementation of the US warmongering clique's criminal plan to use atomic weapons in Korea and Indochina, shaking the forces of war, and greatly promoting the cause of peace. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, once pointed out in this regard: "Of all the factors that have played a major role in preventing the use of atomic weapons in Asia and making it possible for international tensions to ease, undoubtedly the will expressed by people of all strata in various countries after the publication of the Stockholm Declaration played the most important role."
	Based on the Stockholm Declaration signature campaign, in the past five years, people from all countries in the world have continued to wage unremitting struggles to ban the use of atomic weapons and eliminate the threat of new wars. The efforts of countries in the peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries and people, have finally stopped the wars in Korea and Indochina, and eased the international situation. However, the war forces headed by US imperialism are unwilling to see world peace. They have stepped up new war preparation activities, intensified their threats to use atomic weapons, openly prepared for atomic war, and tried their best to make people believe that atomic war is inevitable. They also decided to hand over atomic weapons to the rebuilt Hitler's Wehrmacht. The crazy conspiracy of the war forces has put the people of all countries in the world in the face of a new and serious threat of atomic war.
	In this case, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued a new battle call in January this year, and issued a letter to the people of the world, demanding the immediate destruction and prohibition of the use and production of atomic weapons. People of all countries who care about peace and their own safety have once again quickly taken action and enthusiastically launched a new signature campaign. In just two months, hundreds of millions of peace-loving men and women in more than 40 countries have signed their names on the World Peace Council's letter to the people of the world, expressing their angry protests against the preparation for atomic war. The signature campaign is still in full swing. Now, "Ban atomic weapons!" has not only become the common cry of people from all countries, but also the desire expressed by many important political leaders. The movement against atomic weapons has developed more widely, deeply, and powerfully.
	Peace-loving people have now closely combined this movement with the struggle against the current war conspiracy of imperialism, against the Paris Agreement, against US aggression against China, against the Southeast Asia aggressive group, against the revival of Japanese militarism, against undermining peace in Indochina and Korea, and against the Middle East military bloc. This makes the movement have a more profound meaning and a greater impact.
	Today, five years later, the people of the world also have stronger determination and greater confidence in the struggle against atomic weapons. On the one hand, the United States has lost its monopoly on atomic weapons and its advantage in hydrogen weapons. On the other hand, what is more important and far-reaching is that the Soviet Union has provided an inspiring example for the peaceful use of atomic energy for mankind. It has built the world's first atomic energy power station and is increasingly widely using atomic energy in industry, agriculture, medicine, and other fields. The remarkable achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy have clearly demonstrated to the people of the world that the peaceful use of atomic energy is completely possible, and at the same time has opened up an unprecedentedly bright prospect for the development of human society. Therefore, people from all countries are now launching struggles with redoubled enthusiasm and confidence, resolutely demanding the destruction of atomic weapons and the peaceful use of atomic energy.
	The angry tide of people opposing atomic weapons has alarmed the atomic war merchants. They are spreading a strange argument today, trying to make people believe that atomic weapons are a "humane" weapon. For example, US Secretary of State Dulles recently tried his best to promote the "benefits" of using atomic weapons at a press conference a few days ago.
	People remember that when the Stockholm Declaration signature campaign was launched, the war forces tried their best to weaken the impact of the movement by means of slander, and their attempts failed. Today, the new scale of development of the movement has forced the planners of atomic war to come out in a hurry to whitewash atomic weapons. But the people will not be deceived by sophistry. They see the trembling behind this sophistry, and they also see the conspiracy of atomic war hidden behind this sophistry. In the past five years, the movement of people from all countries in the world against atomic weapons and in defense of peace has made definite achievements and great progress. But the threat of atomic war has not been eliminated today. On the fifth anniversary of the publication of the Stockholm Declaration, people from all countries are determined to further develop the movement against the use of atomic weapons to stop the evil claws of the imperialist war forces preparing for atomic war.

    反对原子武器签名运动的新进展
    陈卓
    五年以前的今天，在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩举行会议的世界和平人士，发表宣言要求禁止原子武器，并号召全世界一切善良的人们在这个宣言上签名，表示自己的意愿。当时，以美国为首的帝国主义国家正在为了延缓逼近中的经济风暴而疯狂地扩充军备，准备新的战争。这个宣言发表后，立即受到了各国人民的热烈响应。要求禁止原子武器的签名运动迅速席卷了整个世界，发展成为一个声势浩大的人民运动。半年多以后，在华沙举行的第二届世界保卫和平大会总结了签名运动的发展规模：“全世界已有五亿以上的男女在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名来表示他们维护和平的意志”。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动使得反对原子武器的思想变成为亿万人民公开宣告的共同主张，使得不同种族、不同性别、不同信仰的各国人民在保卫和平生活的共同口号下，以空前广大的规模团结起来了。全世界各地几亿人民团结一致表现的这个强大意志，在国际生活中发挥了巨大的作用，它制止了美国好战集团在朝鲜和印度支那使用原子武器的罪恶计划的实施，并且震动了战争势力集团，大大推进了和平的事业。世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里对此曾经指出：“在阻止原子武器在亚洲被使用并且使国际紧张局势趋向缓和成为可能的所有因素中，起了主要作用的无疑地是斯德哥尔摩宣言发表后在各国各阶层人民中所表达出来的意志。”
    在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的基础上，五年来，世界各国人民为了禁止使用原子武器和消除新战争威胁，继续进行了坚持不懈的斗争。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的努力，终于停止了朝鲜和印度支那的战争，使国际局势有了缓和。但是以美帝国主义为首的战争势力不愿意看到世界和平。它们加紧了新的准备战争的活动，变本加厉地威胁要使用原子武器，并公开地准备原子战争，竭力要使人民相信原子战争是不可避免的。他们还决定要把原子武器交给正在重建起来的希特勒国防军。战争势力的疯狂策划使世界各国人民面临着原子战争的新的严重威胁。
    在这种情况下，世界和平理事会常务委员会在今年一月发出了新的战斗号召，发表了告全世界人民书，要求立即销毁并禁止使用和生产原子武器。关怀着和平和自己的安全的各国人民，又一次迅速地行动起来，热烈地展开了新的签名运动。在短短的两个月中间，已经有四十几个国家的几亿爱好和平的各国男女在世界和平理事会的告全世界人民书上签上了自己的名字，表示他们对于原子战争准备的愤怒抗议。签名运动还在蓬勃开展中。现在，“禁止原子武器！”不仅已成为各国人民的共同呼声，而且也是许多国家重要政治领袖表示的愿望。反对原子武器的运动已经发展得更广泛、更深入、也更为强大有力了。
    爱好和平人民现在已把这一运动同反对帝国主义当前的战争阴谋，同反对巴黎协定、反对美国侵略中国、反对东南亚侵略集团、反对复活日本军国主义、反对破坏印度支那和朝鲜的和平、反对中东军事集团的斗争紧密地结合在一起了。这就使得这个运动具有更深刻的意义和更巨大的影响。
    在五年以后的今天，世界人民在反对原子武器的斗争中也有了更坚强的决心和更大的信心。一方面，美国已失去了原子武器方面的垄断地位和氢武器的优势。另一方面，具有更重要和深远的意义的是，苏联已为人类和平利用原子能提供了鼓舞人心的榜样。它已建成了世界上第一座原子能电力站，并正在工业、农业、医学等各方面日益广泛地应用着原子能。苏联在和平利用原子能方面所得到的显著成就，向全世界人民清楚地证明了和平利用原子能是已经完全可能的，同时也为人类社会的发展展开了空前灿烂的前景。因此，各国人民现在以加倍的热情和信心来展开斗争，坚决要求销毁原子武器、和平利用原子能。
    人民反对原子武器的怒潮，使原子战争贩子们惊慌了。他们今天正在散布一种奇怪的论调，企图使人相信，原子武器是一种“人道的”武器。例如，美国国务卿杜勒斯几天前就在一次记者招待会上竭力宣传使用原子武器的“好处”。
    人们记得，在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动开展的时候，战争势力曾经竭力想用诽谤的办法来削弱这个运动的影响，它们的企图是落空了。今天，运动的新的发展规模迫使原子战争的策划者们慌忙出来为原子武器进行粉饰。但是人民是不会受狡辩的欺蒙的。他们看到在这种狡辩背后的战栗，他们也看到在这种狡辩背后隐藏着的原子战争的阴谋。五年来世界各国人民反对原子武器、保卫和平的运动已有了肯定的成就和很大的进展。但是原子战争的威胁今天还没有消除。各国人民在纪念斯德哥尔摩宣言发表五周年的今天，决心进一步开展反对使用原子武器的运动，来制止帝国主义战争势力准备原子战争的罪恶魔手。
