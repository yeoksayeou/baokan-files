Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: According to TASS, Paris: The pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on France to achieve the goal of ratifying the Paris Agreements has aroused widespread indignation among the French public. French newspapers continue to comment on Churchill's letter to Mendès France on January 12th of this year. It is known that this letter threatened that if the Paris Agreements were not ratified, France's seat at future international conferences might be occupied by another country.

	"Paris Radical News" pointed out that Churchill's letter was worded harshly and rudely, containing undisguised threats to France. It is "the culmination of the most blatant diplomatic offensive launched by the United States and Britain against an ally since the end of the war."

	"Le Monde" wrote that "this policy (mentioned by Churchill) has long been supported not only in the Pentagon... but also in London." The newspaper emphasized that Churchill was still indulging in the old fantasy of "leadership of the Western countries by a British-American alliance." "When planning international conferences, he has always excluded France. For many years, he has constantly exerted pressure on our country no less than that exerted by the United States, hoping to force us to agree to arm West Germany."

	"Le Monde" continued, "We are now in a position where others are not only threatening to leave us aside but have already begun to rely on Turkey to establish a system of bilateral conventions without consulting us." At this point, "Le Monde" expressed the dissatisfaction that had arisen in France with France's exclusion from the Western countries' military plans in the Middle East.

    英美压迫法国批准巴黎协定
    法国公众广泛表示不满
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：英美两国为了要达到批准巴黎协定的目的而对法国施加压力一事引起了法国公众广泛的愤慨。法国报纸继续评论邱吉尔在今年一月十二日给孟戴斯—弗朗斯的信件，大家知道，这封信威胁说，巴黎协定如果没有得到批准，在将来的国际会议上，法国的席位就可能被别的国家占据。
    “巴黎激进新闻”指出，邱吉尔的信措辞严厉和粗暴，包含着对法国的毫不掩饰的威胁，它是
  “自从大战结束以后，美国和英国对一个盟国发动的最露骨的外交攻势的顶点”。
    “世界报”写道，“（邱吉尔提到的）这个政策不仅在五角大楼早就受到支持……在伦敦也是早就受到支持的。”这家报纸着重说，邱吉尔仍然沉溺于“由英美联合”领导西方国家的老幻想。“他在筹划国际会议时，一直总是排斥法国的。多年来，他不断对我国施加不小于美国所施加的压力，指望强迫我们同意武装西德。”
    “世界报”继续说，“我们现在已处在这样的地位：别人不仅威胁着要撇开我们，而且已经开始不征求我们的意见就已依仗土耳其建立起双边公约系统来了。”谈到这里，“世界报”表示了在法国产生的不满，它不满意法国已被排斥在西方国家在中东的军事计划以外。
