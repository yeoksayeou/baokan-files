Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The residents of Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, and Nanjishan Islands, who were abducted to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, have been sent in batches to the five counties of Yilan, Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hualien.

Taiwanese newspapers revealed that the belongings of these Dachen and other island residents, who were abducted to Taiwan, had already been looted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops when they left their hometowns. During their stay in Keelung City, they lived in extreme poverty. After the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique abducted them to Taiwan, they publicly declared that they could not "afford" to support these people, and forced people from all walks of life in Taiwan to "donate" food and clothing to provide relief. Not only did Chiang Kai-shek's officials take the opportunity to embezzle and enrich themselves, but they also coerced these people in distress to "donate" the food that Taiwanese compatriots had donated to them to be used as military expenses. The Dachen Island residents who were sent to the so-called Sixth Reception Center in Keelung City alone were extorted more than 1,000 catties of rice as a so-called "contribution to the warship fund." Many abducted residents fell ill or died due to hunger, cold, and poverty during their stay in Keelung and other places. In Keelung City alone, more than ten adults died in the ten days from February 16th to 25th. The infant mortality rate was even more alarming. Of the twenty-four infants born between February 9th and 17th, seven died. Some abducted residents were ruined by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, resulting in mental disorders. Jia Bingfu developed mental illness after being abducted to Taiwan because his wife and daughters were abducted and disappeared.

After the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique sent the residents of Dachen and other islands to various parts of Taiwan, the abuse against them intensified. A large number of victims crowded into dilapidated schoolhouses in various places, each receiving only nine taels and three qian of rice per day. Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Daily News" also admitted that these small amounts of rice were "of extremely poor quality, containing small pieces of gravel, stones, charcoal slag, wood chips, rat droppings, etc., with a musty smell that was difficult to swallow and chew." Under the torment of this miserable life, malaria and other diseases became prevalent among the abducted residents, and the number of people falling ill increased sharply.

    大陈等岛被劫居民
    被蒋贼押到台湾东部和南部
    据新华社十四日讯：被蒋贼军劫运到台湾的大陈岛、渔山列岛、披山岛和南麂山列岛的居民，已被分批押送到宜兰、屏东、高雄、台东、花莲五县。
    台湾报纸透露，这些被劫运到台湾的大陈等岛居民，在离开故乡时财物早已被蒋贼军洗劫一空，留居基隆市期间，生活十分困苦。蒋介石卖国集团把他们劫运到台湾后，却公开声明“养不起”这些人，勒逼台湾各阶层人民“捐赠”食物、衣服来救济。蒋贼机关人员非但乘机贪污中饱，而且胁迫这些苦难中的人民把台湾同胞捐赠给他们的食物也
  “捐献”出来充当军费。单被押送到基隆市所谓第六招待所的大陈岛居民，就被勒索了一千多市斤大米的所谓“献舰捐款”。许多被劫居民在留居基隆等地期间，因饥寒穷困而病倒或死亡。仅在二月十六日到二十五日十天内，在基隆市死去的成年人就有十名以上。婴儿死亡率更是惊人，在二月九日到十七日出生的二十四名婴孩中，就有七名死去。有些被劫居民被蒋贼弄得家破人亡，因而神经失常。贾炳福被劫运到台湾后，因妻女都被拐失踪，以致得了精神病。
    蒋介石卖国集团把大陈等岛屿的居民押送到台湾各地后，对他们的虐害也就变本加厉。大批被难人民拥塞在各地破破烂烂的小学校舍中，每人每日只能领到九两三钱米。蒋贼“中央日报”也承认，这些少量的食米也是“质地奇劣，含有小块瓦砾、石子、炭渣、木屑、鼠屎等，一股霉味扑鼻，难吞食嚼咽”。在这种悲惨生活的折磨下，被劫居民中疟疾和其他疾病流行，病倒的人数大增。
