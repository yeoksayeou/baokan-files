Those Who Take Advantage of Public Funds
　　Lü Tao Yu Lin

　　This happened last year. The reason we are making it public is that this incident occurred within the People's Bank, which is responsible for overseeing the use of funds. This illustrates the lack of strict internal financial management in some of the bank's institutions, and this problem has not been resolved even now.

　　In mid-September last year, the Supervision Office of the Heilongjiang Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China discovered a considerable number of employee debts during an internal financial management inspection. To illustrate its severity with numbers: first, the total employee debt was 99,746,126 yuan (old currency, same below); second, out of less than 360 cadres in the entire branch, 196 were debtors, accounting for more than 54% of the total; third, among these debts, 13,413,114 yuan were unrecoverable, and the rest were long overdue.

　　In a state bank, nearly 100 million yuan of huge sums are occupied by individuals. Are there no principles or systems for employee loans? Of course, there are. However, the department in charge of employee loan principles has changed several times over the years, from the Organization and Budget Section to the Personnel Section to the General Affairs Section. Whichever department is in charge of this "principle," it is easier and more common for the cadres in that department to borrow money. Perhaps this is a case of "the nearest water tower gets the moonlight first!" There is also a "system" under the "principle," but this system is actually a mere formality. Because the IOU can be without an approval stamp, and the use can be unchecked. In a word, it's up to the head of the department. For example, in the General Affairs Section, 15 out of 16 people borrowed money, a total of 12,427,000 yuan; the two section chiefs, Sun Wei and Zhao Ming, approved loans for themselves totaling 2,920,000 yuan.

　　Although the use of the loan is not checked, the "reason" for the loan must be stated. Let's take a look at their "reasons"! On many "loan application forms," it is written: "My sister's family is in financial difficulty," "My uncle's funeral has no funds," "Public travel expenses exceeded,"... But there are also straightforward ones who write "personal loan" in four big characters. In any case, since the approving person is not taking the money out of their own pocket, "favor" is happily granted. So the head of the department waves his pen and "approves" the matter.

　　These are the "reasons" for the loans, so what are the actual uses? Of course, some people borrowed money for genuine emergencies, and their loans were legitimate. But some people used part of the loan to buy leather shoes, hats, serge clothing, and coats, and some simply bought wine and meat to eat and drink... Some even used the borrowed public funds to open a private "account" in the bank - to save it! There were also many who borrowed public funds to buy prize-winning savings tickets. For example, Li Shiben, a clerk in the accounting department, owed 570,000 yuan of public funds and refused to repay it, but deposited 400,000 yuan in the bank to earn interest! Qin Sijiang and Yang Guilan are also people who both owed public funds and had deposits in the bank. Cao Xueben borrowed 2.2 million yuan in five installments under the "reason" that "his child was sick," but most of the loan was spent on eating, drinking, and clothing.

　　The reason people are so unscrupulous in spending is that they are very clear that they can borrow again after spending it, and that they don't have to repay the loan if it's already owed. If it is overdue for a long time, it can even be written off under the excuse of "financial difficulty and inability to repay." There is precedent for this. Wang Zhenwu, the head of the rural finance section, wrote off 1 million yuan with such a "reason." If this doesn't work, "life" must be allowed even if it can't be repaid. In the end, administrative subsidies must be given. Therefore, people gave this practice a beautiful name, called "creating conditions for obtaining subsidies."

　　Of course, the problem must be corrected when it is discovered. For this matter, the bank specially held a bank affairs meeting. After the meeting, comrades from the Office, Personnel Section, Supervision Office, and Accounting Section painstakingly studied the income and expenditure of the debtors and decided to deduct the amount from their salaries each month. So, when salaries were paid on October 25th last year, this method was followed.

　　But deducting money was far less pleasing than borrowing money, especially it angered several section chiefs. Deputy Section Chief Wu Chunjie was very unhappy when she saw her salary slip and went to the accountant Guo Daxun, who was responsible for deducting money, that afternoon: "Lao Guo! You deducted too much, didn't leave a 'cent'!" Deputy Section Chief Wu came aggressively, with the "sword drawn" and ready to strike. Helplessly, the accountant gave her an account: "Although we deducted 350,000 yuan from you, it's not too much. On the 13th of this month, you and Deputy Section Chief Liu Shixun (Wu's husband) borrowed 400,000 yuan for cotton clothing, and on the 14th, you each received 200,000 yuan for heating expenses (living in public dormitories). This time, you received a salary of 170,000 yuan. In half a month, you have almost 1 million yuan in income. There is only one old lady and three children in the family. I think it's enough!" This remark not only failed to convince Deputy Section Chief Wu, but made her angry and ashamed, and she had to find the bank president. Sure enough, it was effective to find the bank president. That night, Section Chief Yu of the Accounting Section received an instruction: "Don't deduct too tightly, deducting too tightly will affect the mood of the cadres!" The next day, Section Chief Yu instructed accountant Guo Daxun to return 250,000 yuan of the deduction to Deputy Section Chief Wu.

　　The state's money can't be not recovered, so the Accounting Section deducted 200,000 yuan from the arrears of the two deputy section chiefs, Wu and Liu, when paying the first half of the salary in November on November 10th. This time, the momentum was even stronger, and Deputy Section Chief Liu personally called the Accounting Section, while Deputy Section Chief Wu watched from the side. When the phone reached the Accounting Section, accountant Shi Yuxi picked up the phone and heard Deputy Section Chief Liu say: "I can't stand this deduction!" Interspersed with Deputy Section Chief Wu's voice: "How can we live, do you want us to eat sorghum rice?" After the accusation, they found Deputy Director Wang of the Office, and with Deputy Director Wang's sympathy, they opened a note and took back all 200,000 yuan of deduction from the Accounting Section, because the two section chiefs were "in financial difficulty" and planned to start repaying in 1955.

　　It is worth noting that the plan to recover employee debts has not yet been realized, and more people are borrowing money indiscriminately. Just two days after the salary was paid, another 16 people borrowed 1.55 million yuan. Some people also took advantage of this time to release the wind: All the outstanding public funds will be written off after the New Year!

　　In this way, the problem has been discovered, the cause has been found, and the solution has also been determined. However, the matter has not ended: those who try to take advantage of public funds are still dreaming of waiting for subsidies!

　　May I ask the bank president who is "generous" with the state's funds: when do you plan to seriously deal with this matter? Can unprincipled accommodation really consolidate the "mood" of the cadres?

    占公家便宜的人
    吕涛  玉琳
    这还是去年发生的事。我们所以还要把它公开，是因为这件事发生在掌握监督资金使用的人民银行，它说明了银行的某些机构内部的财务管理缺乏严格的制度，而且直到现在，这个问题还没有得到解决。
    去年九月中旬，中国人民银行黑龙江省分行监察室在检查内部财务管理工作中，发现了相当数目的职工欠款。如果用数字来说明它的严重程度，那就是：第一，职工欠款总计九千九百七十四万六千一百二十六元（旧币，下同）；第二，全行不及三百六十名干部当中，就有一百九十六名是欠款者，占总数百分之五十四还强；第三，在这些欠款中，有一千三百四十一万三千一百一十四元是无法追回的，其余的又是长期拖欠不还。
    在国家银行里竟有近亿元的巨款被私人占用着，难道职工借款连个原则、制度也没有吗？当然都有。不过，掌握职工借款原则的单位，几年来前后由组织预算科、人事科、总务科变换了好几次，哪一部门掌握这个“原则”，哪个部门的干部借款就容易些，多一些，这也许是“近水楼台先得月”吧！“原则”之下还有个“制度”，不过这个制度实际上却等于虚设了。因为，借据上可以没有批准印，也可以不审核用途，一句话，就是主管科长说了算。比如总务科，全科十六个人就有十五个人借了款，共借一千二百四十二万七千元；孙伟和赵明两位科长自借自批了二百九十二万元。
    借款的用途虽然不审核，但借款的“理由”却不能不讲，那就看一看他们的“理由”吧！在许多张“借款申请书”上写着：“姐姐家生活困难”，“叔父安葬无着”，“公出旅费超支了”，……却也有直爽的写上“个人借用”四个大字的。不论怎样，钱既不由批准人从私人腰包里往外掏，当然“人情”是乐而为之的，于是主管科长大笔一挥
  “准借”了事。
    借款的“理由”是这些，那么实际用途又是怎样呢？当然，有些人借的款的确是用于急需了，他们的借款是正当的。但也有些人，却把借款中的部分款买了皮鞋、帽子、哔叽衣服和大衣，有些人干脆就买酒肉吃喝了……，甚至还有人拿借的公款在银行里立了私人“户头”——存起来了，借公款购买有奖储蓄票的，也不在少数。例如会计科科员李世本，欠公款五十七万元不还，却将四十万元存到银行去吃息！秦嗣江和杨桂兰等，也都是既欠公款而又在银行有存款的人。曹学本曾在“孩子有病”的理由下，五次借款二百二十万元，但绝大部分借款吃、喝、穿了。
    人们所以如此肆无忌惮的挥霍，是因为他们非常清楚，花完了可以再借，已欠款可以不还，长期拖欠下去，直到最后在“生活困难，无力还款”的借口下，还可以报销。这是事有前例的，农村金融科科长王振武就曾以这样的“理由”报销了一百万元。如果这一着行不通，偿还不起没办法也得让“生活”，最后行政上还得补助。于是，人们给这种做法起了个美名，叫做“为取得补助创造条件”。
    问题检查出来了，当然要纠正，为了这个事，银行里特别召开了行务会议。会后由办公室、人事科、监察室和会计科几个同志煞费苦心地研究了欠款人员的收支情况，并决定从工薪中逐月扣除。于是，在去年十月二十五日发薪的时候，就按这个办法做了。
    但扣款却远远不像借款那样使人高兴，特别是触怒了几位科长。副科长吴纯洁一看薪金袋就很不高兴，当天下午就找到了会计科负责扣款的会计郭大训：“老郭！你们扣的也太多了，怎么一个
  ‘子’也没给剩？”吴副科长来势凶猛，大有“剑拔弩张”一触即发之势。在无可奈何下，会计向她算了一笔账：“虽然给你扣了三十五万元，但并不算多，本月十三日你和刘世勋副科长（吴的丈夫）共借了四十万元的棉服款，十四日每人又领了二十万元的烤火费（住公家宿舍），这回又领回工薪十七万元，在半个月的时间里，差不多就有一百万元的收入，家里只有一个老太太和三个孩子，我想也够用了吧！”这一席话非但没把吴副科长说服，反使她恼羞成怒，非要找行长去不可。果然找到行长就有效，当天晚上，会计科于科长接到了指示：“不要抠的太紧了，抠的太紧对干部情绪有影响！”第二天，于科长责成会计郭大训将吴副科长的扣款退还二十五万元。
    国家的钱总不能不往回收啊，于是，会计科在十一月十日发十一月份上半月工薪时，又扣了吴、刘两位副科长欠款二十万元。这回来势更猛，刘副科长亲自出头给会计科打电话，吴副科长一旁观阵。电话要到会计科，会计时雨洗拿起电话，只听刘副科长说：“这么扣受不了啊！”夹杂着吴副科长的声音：“这怎么活着，还让我们吃高粱米不？”指责之后又找到了办公室王副主任，在王副主任同情下，开了个便条，从会计科把二十万元扣款全数取回，理由是因为两位科长“生活困难”，准备从一九五五年再开始还款。
    值得注意的是，追还职工欠款的计划还没有实现，乱借款的人又多起来了，刚刚发薪两天，又有十六个人借了一百五十五万元。有的人还趁这时候大放其风：陈欠公款过了新年就全部报销啦！
    就这样，问题被发掘出来了，原因被找出来了，解决办法也同样定了出来，但是，事情并没有完结：那些企图占公家便宜的人们，还在做着等待补助的美梦哩！
    请问“慷”国家之“慨”的行长同志：你打算到什么时候才严肃处理这件事？难道无原则的迁就真可以巩固干部的“情绪”吗？
