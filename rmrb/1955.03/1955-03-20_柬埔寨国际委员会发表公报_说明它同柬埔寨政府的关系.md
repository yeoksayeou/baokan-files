    柬埔寨国际委员会发表公报
    说明它同柬埔寨政府的关系
    【新华社河内十八日电】据金边消息：柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会在三月十四日发表公报说，委员会曾经写信给柬埔寨王国政府首相兰?特，请他注意所谓柬埔寨王国政府同国际委员会之间关系紧张的消息。
    公报说：兰?特在他的复信中指出，前国王西哈努克和国王苏拉马里特以及王国政府在他们的信件、演讲和公告中都从来没有提到过国际委员会。复信也说明，柬埔寨的报纸和广播电台都没有说过任何可能损害国际委员会声誉的话。
    公报说：“国际委员会愿意指出，委员会从来没有接到王国政府对于委员会活动的任何怨言。相反的，委员会同王国政府的关系一直良好。”
    公报指出：“国际委员会在柬埔寨的唯一职责是监察日内瓦协定条款的履行。”
