    Friendship Farm Establishes Department Store
    A small state-run department store has opened at the Third Branch of the State-Run Friendship Farm. The store displays various foods, candies, clothing, knitwear, shoes, stationery, as well as daily necessities such as soap and toothpaste. This store is constantly increasing the variety of goods based on the demands of the workers.
    The store's sales staff enthusiastically engage in supply work. To make it convenient for workers to shop, they extend business hours until 8:00 or 9:00 p.m.
    The Jixian County state-run commercial departments have already established three supply groups at the State-Run Friendship Farm and plan to establish such small supply stores in all branches soon. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    友谊农场设立了百货商店
    一个小型的国营百货商店已在国营友谊农场第三分场开业了。商店里陈设着各种食品、糖果、服装、针织品、鞋子、文具以及肥皂、牙膏等日用品。这个商店正根据职工提出的要求，不断增加商品的种类。
    商店的营业员们热诚地从事供应工作。为了使职工买东西方便，他们把营业时间一直延长到晚间八、九点钟。
    集贤县国营商业部门已经在国营友谊农场设立了三个供应小组，计划最近在所有的分场都设立这种小型的供应商店。　　（据新华社讯）
