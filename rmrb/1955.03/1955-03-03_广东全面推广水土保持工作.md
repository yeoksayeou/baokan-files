Guangdong Province's soil and water conservation work this year will shift from key experiments in the past to mass-based comprehensive promotion. The East Guangdong District has decided to use the four counties of Wuhua, Xingning, Dabu, and Puning as bases to drive the mass-based soil and water conservation work in Pingyuan, Longchuan, Meixian, Haifeng, Lufeng and other counties. The North Guangdong District and the Central Guangdong District are also conducting pilot projects in Nanxiong County and Deqing County respectively. The province has decided to build more than 9,600 large and small check dams in 108 townships this year, and to cut slopes and open terraces with an area of more than 23,700 mu. At present, soil and water conservation work has been launched in various places. Puning County in eastern Guangdong has completed more than 360 check dam projects. Mass-based soil and water conservation projects in Meixian, Xingning, Wuhua, and Longchuan counties have also begun construction. Nanxiong County in the northern Guangdong district selected a village in the first district as a key demonstration project, and recently completed six contour ditches and three intercepting pits, which can control soil erosion area of 210 mu and protect more than 200 mu of farmland.
    In addition, in conjunction with this year's water conservancy census, 26 counties in the eastern, central and northern Guangdong regions are conducting surveys of soil erosion, collecting relevant data, and preparing plans for large-scale mass promotion work in the future.

    广东全面推广水土保持工作
    广东省今年的水土保持工作，将从过去的重点实验转向群众性的全面推广。粤东区决定以五华、兴宁、大埔、普宁四个县为基点，带动平远、龙川、梅县、海丰、陆丰等县展开群众性的水土保持工作。粤北区和粤中区也分别在南雄县和德庆县试点。全省今年决定在一百零八个乡兴建大小型谷坊工程九千六百多座，削坡和开梯级面积二万三千七百多市亩。目前各地水土保持工作已经展开，粤东普宁县已完成谷坊工程三百六十座以上。梅县、兴宁、五华、龙川等县的群众性水土保持工程，也已开始施工。粤北区的南雄县，选择第一区的一个村为重点示范工程，最近也完成了等高沟洫六条，拦坑沟三处，可控制水土流失面积二百一十市亩，保护农田二百多亩。
    此外，结合今年的水利普查工作，粤东、粤中、粤北区有二十六个县进行水土流失情况调查，搜集有关资料，为今后展开大规模的群众性的推广工作，做好计划准备。
