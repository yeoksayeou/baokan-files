    State-Run Xijiang Farm Raises Hogs on a Large Scale
    To better supply the meat needs of urban residents and solve the source of fertilizer for agricultural production, the state-run Xijiang Mechanical Farm in Guangxi Province plans to raise more than 10,000 hogs this year. In order to strengthen the leadership of hog production, in addition to establishing a special organization, the farm also clearly stipulated the methods of raising and management: each hog is required to gain eighteen pounds per month and accumulate more than 150 pounds of fertilizer; also, agricultural by-products such as peanut vines and bean cakes should be fully utilized for feeding; at the same time, sanitation and disease prevention should be done well.

    国营西江农场大量饲养毛猪
    广西省国营西江机械农场，为了更多的供应城市人民肉食的需要，和解决农业生产的肥料来源，计划今年饲养一万多头毛猪。为加强对毛猪生产的领导，场里除了成立专门机构外，还明确规定了饲养管理方法：要求每头毛猪每月能增长十八斤重，积肥一百五十多斤；并要充分利用花生藤、豆饼等农业副产品来饲养；同时还要做好清洁卫生和防治疾病工作。                   （陈海云）
