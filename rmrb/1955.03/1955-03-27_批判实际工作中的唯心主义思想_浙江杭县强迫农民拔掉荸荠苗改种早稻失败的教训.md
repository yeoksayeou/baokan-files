Criticizing Idealistic Thinking in Practical Work
    —The Lesson of the Failure of Forcing Farmers in Hang County, Zhejiang, to Uproot Arrowhead Seedlings and Switch to Early Rice
    Chen Wen

Reasonably changing agricultural cultivation habits is an effective way to tap the potential of agricultural production and lead farmers to increase grain production. This method has been implemented in some areas and has achieved significant results. In 1954, Anhui Province implemented the "Three Changes" plan in the Huaibei area, increasing the proportion of summer harvested crops in the total crops, changing to planting high-yield crops and water-resistant crops, and changing extensive cultivation habits, so that the Huaibei area still increased grain production despite being hit by a severe flood. In 1954, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, switched to planting late japonica rice on more than 117,000 mu, with an average yield increase of 28 percent per mu compared to planting medium indica rice. There is no doubt that these are all good things. The Party and the People's Government should lead farmers to actively do it, and if done well, it will definitely be supported by the farmers. However, such a good thing was done badly in Hang County, Zhejiang. The farmers of Hang County painfully revealed to this newspaper the incident of being forced to uproot arrowhead seedlings (see the reader's letter page on the sixth page of today's newspaper). In August 1954, under the order of the Hang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county government, the farmers of Hang County destroyed more than 40,000 mu of arrowhead seedlings and switched to nearly 30,000 mu of continuous cropping of early rice, most of which yielded nothing. The calculable losses alone amounted to about 2 million yuan! The investigation report of this newspaper further exposed the seriousness of the problem.

The Hang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county government decided that the whole county would not grow arrowheads and switch to continuous cropping of early rice. Their subjective wish was to lead farmers to achieve the goal of over-producing grain. However, they made a subjective error. At that time, the situation in front of them was that after harvesting early rice, the farmers had already cultivated more than 40,000 mu of arrowhead seedlings according to their usual habits, and some had already planted them; but the Party and government leading organs of Hang County insisted that the masses uproot the arrowhead seedlings and switch to early rice. They completely ignored the fact that the local people had no experience in continuous cropping of early rice, and they also ignored the natural conditions. At that time, it was already August, and it was too late to plant early rice again. If calculated according to the general need of 90 to 100 days for rice from sowing to maturity, it would not mature until late November. In their minds, it seemed that things would develop according to their will against the laws of nature—early rice could still mature in November and December. How could they not run into a wall!

That is exactly how things developed. Their government orders were opposed by the county's labor model symposium before they even left the door; when they were passed down to the districts and townships, they were opposed by the district and township cadres; when they were passed down to the farmers, the farmers pleaded bitterly to the cadres, saying that this could not be done. However, "this is the order of the political commissar (county party secretary) and the deputy county head, who dares to disobey?" Many farmers had to tearfully uproot the arrowhead seedlings and sow the early rice seeds. However, the climate did not change its laws because of the orders of the secretary and the county head, and before the rice matured, the weather turned cold, resulting in the majority of the crop failing to yield anything. In the face of a series of ruthless facts, the leading organs of Hang County still wanted everyone not to waver; saying that "if we made a mistake, the county committee will be responsible for making a self-criticism in the future." Unfortunately, the Hang County Committee did not carry out this "responsible" spirit to the end. When the facts came out and made a conclusion, the county committee even took an irresponsible attitude towards the farmers' request to cut down the rice stalks to feed the cattle. The indignation of the farmers in Hang County about this matter is completely understandable. And the subjective idealism of the leading organs of a county, the Hang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and its leaders, county party secretary Zhang Shusen, and deputy county head of Hang County Li Guangxin, is indeed surprisingly stubborn. How else can we explain this stubborn "spirit" of persisting in mistakes regardless of the facts? The only explanation is that although they are Communist Party members and materialists, in their work, they are still unconsciously dominated by idealistic thinking.

Changing cultivation habits is an extremely complex issue, and a feasible plan must be proposed after careful investigation and research. The experience of other places must never be mechanically copied. Anhui Province, based on the characteristics of the Huaibei area, which has large rainfall and is often threatened by floods and waterlogging, proposed to plant more summer crops and water-resistant crops. Dingxi area, Gansu Province, has a dry climate and sparse rainfall, with little rain in spring and summer, and rain mainly falls in July, August, and September. Therefore, it was proposed to plant more autumn crops and less summer crops. Two different regions, starting from reality, produced two completely different policies. Therefore, only when the leading organs conduct thorough investigations and research, accurately grasp the laws of local agricultural production, can they find a policy for changing cultivation habits that is in line with local conditions. Even so, with the correct policy and plan, many other issues must be considered when implementing it, such as the farmers' experience, technology, and material conditions. Such issues that are directly related to the lives of millions of people cannot be taken lightly. The leading organs of Hang County made the decision to replant early rice after harvesting early rice, which violated the conditions for crop growth and the laws of climate. This fully demonstrates that they did not conduct thorough investigation and research, and issued orders based on the wishful thinking of over-producing grain. This subjective idealism is simply idealism. Does it not clearly deny that the material world exists outside of consciousness? It does not study nor does it believe that things have their own laws, but vainly attempts to use subjective wishes to change objective existence and change objective laws. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to obtain the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." Isn't this the fundamental reason for the failure of Hang County's replanting of continuous cropping of early rice? Not conducting systematic and thorough investigation and research work, and not starting from reality, is a prominent manifestation of idealistic thinking in our practical work.

The decision of the Party and government leading organs of Hang County to completely eliminate arrowheads and switch to early rice was not without opposition from district and township cadres and the masses at the time. If the leading cadres had been a little more modest, had doubted their own decision, it would not have been too late to correct this mistake at that time. However, why couldn't they listen to the opinions of the district and township cadres and farmers at all? This is also due to their viewpoint. They believed that the district and township cadres' opposition to uprooting arrowhead seedlings and switching to early rice was "negative," "fearful of difficulties," "lacking a communist spirit," and not daring to boldly "create." Indeed, for Communist Party members, we do have the great ambition to transform the world. For the victory of communism, no force in the world can stop us from moving forward. In the eyes of Communist Party members, there are no insurmountable difficulties. We are always full of vitality and full of life. We can break through all conservative ideas and boldly create all new things that are in line with the interests of the people. However, where does this fearless heroism of Communist Party members come from? Is it based on one's own enthusiasm? Is it based on one's own personal good intentions? Is it based on one's own blind energy? No. The heroism of Communist Party members does not come from a subjective fighting spirit, but from mastering the truth of Marxism-Leninism, from mastering the laws of the development of objective things. Our goals, our determination, and our actions are completely in line with the laws of social development, and therefore we are invincible. The Party and government leading comrades of Hang County, however, exposed an idealistic viewpoint on this issue. They demanded that district and township cadres turn the communist spirit into blind adventure, violate the laws of nature, and boldly "create" the miracle of autumn continuous cropping of early rice; they used the fearless heroism of Communist Party members to treat the bitter pleas of the farmers coldly, "boldly" damage the interests of the masses, and resolutely eliminate arrowhead seedlings. When their decisions were opposed by lower-level cadres and farmers, they did not re-examine their decisions, correct their mistakes, but instead rudely drove district and township cadres onto the road of coercion and commandism, completely violating the Party's mass line working methods, and causing irreparable mistakes.

The attitude of the Party and government leading organs of Hang County towards the masses of farmers also exposed that they had no mass viewpoint at all. They simply did not believe in the masses. They convened a county-wide labor model symposium, but did not consider the valuable opinions put forward by the labor models. It is obvious that they convened this meeting not to discuss with the masses how to over-produce, but to force the labor models to take the lead in implementing the county committee's decision. When the farmers were unwilling to uproot the arrowhead seedlings, they convened meetings to scold the farmers who refused to uproot the seedlings for "not loving the country" and "having capitalist ideas," and threatened the masses with "purchasing more surplus grain." Even the county party secretary said such things, that farmers are "backward," and for stubborn farmers, do not supply them with grain, let them eat arrowheads. They regarded themselves as "heroes," thinking that as long as the leadership had the determination, they could completely ignore whether the masses of farmers were willing or not, and do whatever they wanted. This viewpoint of despising the people and disregarding the interests of the masses completely violated historical materialism. They forgot what Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us: the people are the real heroes, the creativity of the masses is infinite, we can only be invincible by relying on the people, only the people are the creators of history, and the true history is the history of the people.

The attitude towards mistakes is also a touchstone for judging whether a person is a materialist or an idealist. Materialists, in the face of truth, when practice proves that their decisions and understandings are wrong, are not afraid to admit mistakes, revise their understandings, so that their thinking can better suit objective laws and do their work well. However, the Party and government leading cadres and the county committee of Hang County were not like this. They have always adhered to their wrong decisions, and even when the harvest was hopeless, they were still shouting with their eyes closed, "Don't waver." They continued to say shamelessly, "If we made a mistake, the county committee will be responsible for making a self-criticism in the future." However, even when this newspaper conducted an investigation into this matter, the Hang County Committee had not assumed any responsibility for this matter! What does this explain? That is, the Hang County Committee and those directly responsible leading cadres made mistakes, damaged the interests of the people, and damaged the interests of the Party, and they still cannot stand on the Party's position, conduct serious self-criticism, and openly admit their mistakes to the masses and lower-level cadres. Of course, it is even less likely that they will learn a painful lesson from this incident, improve their thinking, and correct their mistakes. The people have reason to demand that the Hang County Committee conduct a thorough review of this mistake, identify the responsibility, and make a serious handling of it.

The failure of Hang County's uprooting of arrowhead seedlings and switching to early rice reflects how much damage Party leading cadres can cause to the Party and the people once they deviate from dialectical materialism. However, such incidents are not only occurring in Hang County in Zhejiang Province's campaign to over-produce grain in 1954. Therefore, such incidents seriously warn us that in our practical work, idealism still has its place and is very harmful. We should not only launch a critique of bourgeois idealistic thinking in the ideological and academic circles, but also discover and criticize the idealistic thinking that exists in practical work. Only in this way can we further carry out the ideological struggle of publicizing materialism and criticizing idealism. To enable our vast numbers of cadres and the masses to realize that materialism and idealism are not some abstruse problems, but problems that we encounter every day in our lives. In order to improve the theoretical level of the vast number of Party members and cadres, establish materialistic thinking, and ensure the victory of socialist construction, we must never let go of incidents such as the failure of Hang County's switching to continuous cropping of early rice. By analyzing these incidents, learning lessons, and educating cadres, we must concretely grasp materialism, eliminate idealism, and defeat the great enemy of subjectivism that exists in practical work.

    批判实际工作中的唯心主义思想
    ——浙江杭县强迫农民拔掉荸荠苗改种早稻失败的教训
    陈文
    合理地改变农业耕作习惯，是挖掘农业生产中的潜在力量，领导农民增加粮食产量的一个有效方法。这个方法，在有些地区实行了，并且收到了显著的效果。一九五四年，安徽省在淮北地区实行“三改”计划，改变（增加）夏季收获的作物在整个农作物中所占的比重，改种高产作物和耐水作物，改变粗放的耕作习惯，使淮北地区，在遭受特大洪水的袭击之下，还增产了粮食。浙江省海宁县一九五四年改种晚粳稻十一万七千多亩，比种中籼稻每亩平均增产百分之二十八。没有疑问的，这些都是好事。党和人民政府应该领导农民积极去做，做好了，一定会得到农民的拥护。不过，这样的好事，在浙江杭县却被作坏了。杭县农民痛心地向本报揭发了强迫他们拔掉荸荠苗的事件（见今日本报第六版读者来信专页）。一九五四年八月，杭县农民在中共杭县县委和县政府的命令下，毁掉四万多亩荸荠苗，改种连作早稻近三万亩，绝大部分颗粒无收。光是算得出的损失，就达二百万元左右！本报对这一事件的调查报告，进一步暴露了问题的严重性。
    中共杭县县委和县政府决定全县不种荸荠，改种连作早稻，他们的主观愿望是希望能够领导农民达到超额增产粮食的目的。可是，他们犯了主观主义的错误。当时，摆在他们面前的情况，是农民在收割了早稻以后，已经按照往年习惯培育了四万多亩的荸荠苗，而且，有的已经种下去了；但杭县的党政领导机关却硬要群众拔掉荸荠苗，改种早稻。他们完全不顾当地群众并无连作早稻的经验，也不顾自然的条件。当时已是八月了，再种早稻已经迟了。如果按照水稻从播种到成熟一般地需要九十天到一百天的时间来计算，就要到十一月下旬以后才能成熟。在他们的心目中，似乎事情会违反自然规律而按照他们的意志发展——早稻到十一月、十二月还能成熟。这样，怎么能不碰壁呢！
    事情也正是如此发展的。他们的政令还没有出门，就遭到了全县劳动模范座谈会的反对；传到了区乡里，又遭到区乡干部的反对；传到农民中间，农民向干部苦苦哀求，不能这样做。但是“这是政委（县委书记）和副县长的命令，谁敢不服从”，许多农民只得含泪拔毁荸荠苗，播下早稻种。可是气候并没有因为书记和县长的命令而改变它的规律，没等到稻子成熟，天气就冷下来了，以致绝大部分颗粒无收。在一连串无情的事实面前，杭县的领导机关还要大家不动摇；说什么“搞错了，将来由县委负责检讨”。可惜，杭县县委并没有把这种“负责”精神贯彻到底。当事实出来作了结论，县委竟连对农民提出要割下稻秸喂牛的要求，都采取了不负责的态度。杭县农民对于这件事的愤慨，是完全可以理解的。而一个县的领导机关，中共杭县县委会和它的领导者县委书记张树森、杭县副县长李广新的主观主义，确也惊人的顽强。怎样才能解释这种不顾事实坚持错误的顽固“气概”呢？唯一的说明，就是他们虽是共产党员，唯物主义者，但在工作中，却仍不自觉地受着唯心主义思想的支配。
    改变耕作习惯，是一个极其复杂的问题，必须经过周密的调查研究才能提出可行的方案，绝不能硬搬别处的经验。安徽省根据淮北地区的特点，雨量大，经常遭到洪水和内涝的威胁，就提出了要多种夏季作物和耐水作物。甘肃省定西地区，气候干旱，雨量稀少，春夏两季缺雨，多在七、八、九三个月里下雨，因此，提出了要多种秋季作物，少种夏田。两个不同地区，从实际出发，就产生了两种完全不同的方针。因之，只有领导机关经过周密的调查研究，准确地掌握了当地农业生产的规律，才能找到合乎当地条件的改变耕作习惯的方针。即使如此，有了正确的方针和计划，在推行的时候，还得考虑许多别的问题，比如，农民的经验，技术和物质的条件。像这样直接关系千百万人生活的问题，是一点轻率不得的。杭县的领导机关，在收了早稻之后作出再种早稻的决定，违反了作物生长的条件和气候的规律，这就充分说明了他们是没有经过周密的调查研究，凭着想当然的超额增产的愿望在发号施令。这种主观主义，就是唯心主义。它不是明明地否认了物质世界是存在于意识以外的吗？它不去研究也不认为事物有自己的规律性，而是妄想用主观愿望，来改变客观的存在，改变客观的规律性。毛泽东同志说过：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”这不正是杭县改种连作早稻失败的根本原因吗？不作系统的周密的调查研究工作，不从实际出发，是唯心主义思想在我们实际工作中一个突出的表现。
    杭县党政领导机关作出彻底消灭荸荠、改种早稻的决定，当时，不是没有遭到区乡干部和群众的反对。如果领导干部稍为虚心一点，怀疑一下自己的决定，在那个时候要纠正这个错误，也并不为晚。可是，为什么他们对区乡干部和农民的意见，一点也听不进去呢？这也是有他们的看法的。他们认为区乡干部反对拔掉荸荠苗，改种早稻，是“消极”“畏难”，“没有共产主义事业心”，不敢大胆地“创造”。不错的，对于共产党员来说，我们确实是具有改造世界的伟大气魄。为了共产主义的胜利，世界上没有任何力量能够挡住我们的前进。在共产党员眼里，没有不能克服的困难。我们永远是富有活力，生气勃勃的。我们能够突破一切保守思想，大胆地创造一切符合于人民利益的新事物。但是，共产党员这种大无畏的英雄气概，从那里来的呢？是凭自己的一股热情吗？是凭自己的个人的良好决心吗？是凭自己的盲目干劲吗？不是的。共产党员的英雄气概，不是来自主观的战斗精神，而是来自掌握了马克思列宁主义真理，来自掌握了客观事物发展的规律。我们的奋斗目标，我们的决心，我们的行动，是完全合乎社会的发展规律，因而也是无往而不利的。杭县的党政领导同志，却在这个问题上，同样暴露了唯心主义的观点。他们要求区乡干部把共产主义的事业心变成盲目的冒险，违背自然规律，去大胆“创造”秋季连作早稻的奇迹；把共产党员大无畏的英雄气概，用去冷酷地对待农民的苦苦哀求，“大胆”地损害群众利益，坚决地消灭荸荠苗。他们当自己的决定遭到下级干部和农民反对的时候，不去重新审查自己的决定，纠正自己的错误，反而粗暴地驱使区乡干部走上强迫命令的道路，完全违背了党的群众路线的工作方法，造成了不可挽救的错误。
    杭县的党政领导机关，对待农民群众的态度，也暴露了他们丝毫没有群众观点。他们根本不相信群众。他们召开全县劳动模范座谈会，却对劳动模范们提出的宝贵意见不加考虑。显而易见的，他们召开这个会议，并不是为的同群众商量怎样超额增产，而是要强迫劳动模范去带头执行县委的决定。当农民不肯拔掉荸荠苗的时候，他们就召开会议，责骂拒绝拔苗的农民“不爱国”、“有资本主义思想”，用“多购余粮”来威胁群众。甚至从县委书记的嘴里也说出这样的话来，农民就是“落后”，对于顽固的农民，不供应粮食，叫他吃荸荠好了。他们把自己看成是“英雄好汉”，以为只要领导方面有了决心，可以完全不管农民群众愿意不愿意，为所欲为。这种藐视人民群众、不顾群众利益的观点，完全违背了历史唯物主义。他们忘掉了毛泽东同志所经常教导我们的：人民群众是真正伟大的，群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，我们只有依靠了人民群众，才是不可战胜的，只有人民群众，才是历史的创造者，真正的历史是人民群众的历史。
    对于错误所采取的态度，也是判别一个人是唯物主义者还是唯心主义者的试金石。唯物主义者，在真理面前，在实践证明了自己的决定和认识错了的时候，是不怕承认错误，修正自己的认识，使自己的思想能够更加适合客观规律，做好工作的。可是，杭县的党政领导干部和县委会却不是如此的。他们一直坚持自己的错误决定，甚至眼见收成绝望的时候，还在那里闭着眼睛叫嚷“不要动摇”。继续大言不惭地说“如果搞错了，将来由县委负责作检讨”。然而，直到本报对这一件事进行调查的时候，也还没有见到杭县县委对于这一件事承担起了什么责任！这又说明了什么呢？那就是杭县县委和那些直接负责的领导干部，犯了错误，损害了人民的利益，损害了党的利益，还不能站到党的立场上，进行严肃的自我批评，公开地向群众向下级干部承认错误。当然，更谈不到从这次事件中，接受沉痛教训，提高思想，改正错误。人民有理由要求杭县县委对这一错误进行深刻的检查，查明责任，作出严肃的处理。
    杭县拔除荸荠苗改种早稻失败的事件，反映了党的领导干部，一旦离开了辩证唯物主义，就会给党给人民造成多大的损害。可是，像这样的事件，在浙江省一九五四年开展超额增产粮食的运动中，并不只是发生在杭县一个地方。因此，这类事件，又严重地警告了我们，在我们的实际工作中，唯心主义还有它的地盘，为害不浅。我们不仅是应该在思想学术界展开对资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判，还必须发现和批判在实际工作中存在的唯心主义思想。只有如此，才可能把宣传唯物主义，批判唯心主义的思想斗争，进一步展开。使我们广大的干部和人民群众，认识到唯物主义和唯心主义不是什么高深莫测的问题，而是天天在我们生活中碰到的问题。为了提高广大党员和干部的理论水平，树立唯物主义的思想，保证社会主义建设的胜利，我们要绝不放松像杭县改种连作早稻失败这样的事件，通过分析这些事件，吸取教训，教育干部，具体地掌握唯物主义，驱除唯心主义，打倒实际工作中存在的主观主义的大敌。
