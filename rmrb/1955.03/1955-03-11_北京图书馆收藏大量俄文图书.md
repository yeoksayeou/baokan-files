The Soviet Books Room of the Beijing Library now holds more than 110,000 Russian books, making it the place with the largest collection of Russian books in our country. Now, this reading room receives three to four thousand new Russian books every month.

Besides purchasing them from the International Bookstore, the Soviet books are also sent regularly by the three major libraries, such as the Soviet State Lenin Library. These books include publications from the early days of the October Revolution to 1945, and a few old versions from before 1840.

Many readers borrow Russian books in the reading rooms of the Beijing Library every day. The Tangshan Railway Institute borrowed Russian books 75 times in one year. Feng Xiqian, the chief of the technical inspection section of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, learned the latest Soviet technical inspection methods from the book "On-site Statistical Inspection Method of Machine Manufacturing Plants," which turned their factory's technical inspection work from passive to active.

Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet Books Room has also translated nine books related to library business, such as "Library Technology," "Unified Cataloging Regulations of Soviet Libraries," and "Reader's Handbook of the Lenin Library," totaling approximately 800,000 characters. These books are being published successively.

    北京图书馆收藏大量俄文图书
    北京图书馆的苏联图书室现已收藏十一万多册俄文图书，成为我国目前收藏俄文图书最多的地方。现在，这个图书室每个月都可以收到三、四千册新的俄文书。
  苏联图书的来源，除了从国际书店购买外，就是苏联国立列宁图书馆等三大图书馆按时寄来的。这些图书中，有苏联十月革命初期到一九四五年的出版物，并有少数一八四○年以前的古老版本。
    在北京图书馆的各阅览室里每天都有许多读者借阅俄文书籍。唐山铁道学院一年中借了七十五次俄文图书。北京农业机械厂的技术检查科长冯希谦从“机械制造厂现场统计检查法”一书学到了苏联最新的技术检查方法，使他们厂里的技术检查工作由被动转为主动。
    苏联图书室还翻译了“图书馆技术”、“苏联图书馆统一编目条例”、“列宁图书馆读者手册”等九种有关图书馆业务的书籍，共约八十万字，这些书正在陆续出版。（新华社）
