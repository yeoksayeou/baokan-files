Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 27th: Following the architectural principles of economy, practicality, and aesthetics, the originally artistically designed four ancient bridgehead pagodas and many false decorative parts of the Han River Highway Bridge, which were impractical, have been modified. With this revision, the Han River Highway Bridge will save the country over 170,000 yuan in artistic design costs, accounting for over 36% of the original total cost of the bridge's artistic design. The revised design will be more solemn and simple in architectural art than the original design.

The artistic design of the Han River Highway Bridge was designed by the Central and Southern Industrial Building Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering in the second half of 1954. Initially, the designers created three plans with similar costs. Finally, after joint determination by relevant units, the artistic design plan with the theme of decorating four ancient pagoda-shaped buildings, the so-called national form, was adopted, and construction drawings were designed based on this plan. It was not until recently, after studying Khrushchev's report at the All-Soviet Conference of Construction Workers and listening to the relayed report of the design and construction conference of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, that people discovered that the original artistic design plan had many false decorations, was flashy but impractical, and wasted funds. It was decided to revise it again. This modification includes the following: completely eliminating the four ancient bridgehead pagodas, which are impractical and wasteful; simplifying the stone carved railings on the approach bridges on both sides and the iron carved railings on the main bridge, replacing some railings with planting of privet trees; and replacing the numerous octagonal ancient palace lanterns used on both sides of the bridge in the original design with ordinary lamps and reducing the quantity. In addition, other artistic decorations on the bridge have also been greatly simplified, and many unnecessary murals and reliefs have been omitted.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Shenyang Municipal Design Company recently revised its past designs for the Fushun Hospital and the company's office building, saving the country 30,000 yuan. This is an improvement in the company's work after studying the documents of the All-Soviet Conference of Construction Workers.

Last year, the company used the so-called "national form" to design Fushun Hospital. After studying, the designers felt that such a design was neither practical, economical, nor beautiful. For example, due to the use of large roofs, the building facade was high, wasting 130,000 red bricks, and using more than 10% more timber; because of the use of glazed green tiles, it would cost 12,000 yuan more than using ordinary tiles; and the price of marble per square meter was three to four times higher than the price of terrazzo. Therefore, before the Fushun Hospital project started, they took the initiative to revise the original design, changing the large roof to an ordinary roof, changing the marble to terrazzo, and eliminating unnecessary decorations such as "brackets" and "eaves." Such a design can save more than 25,000 yuan compared to the original design. In addition, they also modified the wooden fence and main entrance of the company's office building, which can also save the country more than 5,000 yuan.

[Our Newspaper] Some construction units in Tianjin have begun to check for poor project quality and waste in connection with the construction situation of their units. Engineering technicians and management cadres at the construction sites of the Housing Repair Project Department of the Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau revealed in discussions many problems in project quality, such as chimneys not ventilating properly, rough cement floors, and blocked drains, which caused many inconveniences to users. Technician Han Rongzeng said, "In the past, I paid attention to quality when installing beams and purlins, but I didn't pay much attention to plastering and decoration projects, thinking that loose doors and windows and cracked floors were common things, and I didn't consider whether it would be convenient for future users. This is very wrong." Some employees at construction sites that have already started construction have begun to pay attention to project quality during construction. For example, in the early stage of construction at the Second Construction Site of the Fifth Construction Company, the quality of some work sections was not good enough. After the leading cadres of the construction site saw the reports in the newspaper exposing the poor quality of the project, they initially checked their thinking of emphasizing quantity over quality, and put forward requirements to each work section to ensure quality and reduce waste. The person in charge of the work section strengthened the quality inspection work and reversed the phenomenon of incomplete grouting in some bricklaying projects. The leading cadres and engineering technicians of the gymnasium construction site of the First Construction Company also specifically studied measures to ensure quality at the construction site dispatch meeting.

Employees of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau paid attention to exposing various waste and backlog phenomena. Zhu Ming, a labor model of the Municipal Construction Engineering Department of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau, exposed the serious waste caused by blind construction without drawings during the winter construction last year, in which the rework of sewers and roads wasted more than 1,600 workdays. It was originally said that the foundation of a certain office would not have a floor, but after the workers transported soil overnight to fill a 1.3-meter foundation, a floor was required, wasting more than 1,000 workdays. He suggested that the leadership should strengthen planning in the future, not blindly construct without drawings, and earnestly change the practice of only pursuing speed without regard to quality, and cherish the state's key construction funds. Zou Sizhen, a staff member of the Shanghai Office of the Bureau, exposed that the Basic Construction Department of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau retained 87,470.5 kilograms of No. 2 and No. 3 pig iron in Shanghai, worth more than 14,000 yuan, which had been backlogged for more than a year and no one cared about it. Zou Sizhen had repeatedly written to the Basic Construction Department to report the above situation, but it had never been dealt with.

### 武汉沈阳修改设计避免浪费  天津洛阳建筑业职工揭发浪费现象提出节约办法

    武汉沈阳修改设计避免浪费
    天津洛阳建筑业职工揭发浪费现象提出节约办法
    【新华社武汉二十七日电】根据经济、适用和美观的建筑原则，汉水公路桥原来艺术设计中毫不适用的四座古老的桥头宝塔和许多虚假装饰的部分已作修改。经过这一修改，汉水公路桥在艺术设计方面就可为国家节约资金十七万多元，约为这座桥原来艺术设计总造价的百分之三十六强。修改后的设计在建筑艺术上要比原设计庄严朴实。
    汉水公路桥的艺术设计是由建筑工程部中南工业建筑设计院在一九五四年下半年设计的。当初设计人员一共作出了三个造价差不多的方案，最后经有关单位共同确定采取了以装饰四座古式塔形建筑为主题的所谓民族形式的艺术设计方案，并根据这个方案进行施工图的设计。直到最近，人们学习了赫鲁晓夫在全苏建筑工作人员会议上的报告，听了建筑工程部设计和施工会议的传达报告，才发现原定艺术设计方案有许多虚饰、华而不实、浪费资金之处，决定重新加以修改。这次修改包括以下部分：全部取消四座不适用、浪费最大的古式桥头宝塔；简化两岸引桥石质塑花栏杆和正桥的铁质雕花栏杆，部分栏杆用培植冬青树代替；原设计中桥上两旁所用数量繁多的八角古式宫灯，都改成普通灯，并减少数量。此外，桥上其他艺术装饰也都大加简化，许多不必要的壁画和浮雕一概省略。
    据新华社讯：沈阳市设计公司最近修改了过去对抚顺医院和这个公司办公大楼的设计，为国家节省了三万元。这是这个公司的设计人员学习了全苏建筑工作人员会议文件后的一项工作改进。
    这个公司去年是采用所谓“民族形式”来设计抚顺医院的。设计人员们学习以后，感到这样的设计既不适用，又不经济，也不好看。例如，由于采用大屋顶，建筑物立面高，光红砖就要浪费十三万块，木材要多用百分之十以上；因为采用绿釉瓦，就要比用一般瓦多花一万二千元；每平方公尺大理石的价格也比水磨石的价格贵三四倍。因此，他们趁抚顺医院工程还没有动工以前，就主动修改了原来的设计，把大屋顶改成一般的屋顶，大理石改成水磨石，一些“斗拱”“起檐”等不必要的装饰也都取消了。这样的设计，比原来的设计就可节省两万五千多元。此外，他们又修改了过去设计的本公司办公大楼的木围墙和正门，也可以为国家节省五千多元。
   【本报讯】天津市有些建筑施工单位的职工，开始联系本单位施工情况检查工程质量低劣和浪费现象。市房地产管理局房屋修建工程处各工地工程技术人员、管理干部在座谈中揭发许多工程质量上的毛病，如烟筒不通气、水泥地面粗糙、下水管堵塞等，都给使用者带来许多不便。技术人员韩荣增说：“过去我在上柁上檩时很注意质量，可是一开始做抹灰、装饰工程就不大注意了，觉得门窗走扇、地面裂纹是平常的事，没有考虑将来的使用者方便不方便，这是很不对的。”有些已开工工地的职工，在施工中开始注意了工程质量。如第五建筑公司第二工地在开工初期，有的工段质量不够好，该工地领导干部看到报纸上揭发工程质量低劣的报道以后，初步检查了自己重量不重质的思想，并向各工段提出保证质量、减少浪费的要求，工段负责人加强了质量检查工作，扭转了部分砌墙工程中灌浆不满的现象。第一建筑公司体育馆工地的领导干部和工程技术人员，在工地调度会议上也专门研究了保证质量的措施。
    洛阳工程局的职工注意揭发了各种浪费、积压现象。洛阳工程局市政建设工程处劳动模范朱明，揭发了去年冬季施工中没有图纸就盲目施工所造成的严重浪费，其中下水道和马路返工重修浪费了一千六百多个工，某办公室地基原来说不做地板，等工人连夜运土填了一公尺三的地基后又要做地板，浪费了一千多个工。他建议领导上今后要加强计划性，没有图纸，不要盲目施工，切实改变只图快不顾质量的做法，珍惜国家重点建设的资金。该局上海办事处工作人员邹斯震揭发洛阳工程局基本建设处在上海留存了二号、三号生铁八万七千四百七十点五公斤，价值一万四千多元，已积压一年多无人过问。邹斯震曾一再写信给基本建设处反映以上情况，却始终不见处理。
