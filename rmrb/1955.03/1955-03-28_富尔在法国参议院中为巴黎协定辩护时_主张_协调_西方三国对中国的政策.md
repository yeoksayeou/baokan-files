Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 27th: French Prime Minister Faure, in his speech to the French Senate on the evening of the 26th, requesting the ratification of the Paris Accords, emphasized that the countries of the North Atlantic group, especially the United States, Britain, and France, should "coordinate" their policies. According to Agence France-Presse, Faure mentioned the Western countries' policy towards China in his speech, saying: "It is inconceivable that only one of the three major Western powers has recognized Communist China. Moreover, China's seat in the Security Council is still occupied by the Taipei (Chiang Kai-shek) government, which shows a complete lack of political realism." Faure's remarks about China were made when he was issuing crude threats and singing a deceptive tune of "resuming negotiations with the Soviet Union" after the ratification of the Paris Accords, in order to get the French Senate to approve the Paris Accords.

    富尔在法国参议院中为巴黎协定辩护时
    主张“协调”西方三国对中国的政策
   【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国总理富尔二十六日晚在法国共和国参议院发表的要求批准巴黎协定的演说中强调北大西洋集团国家特别是美、英、法三国应该“协调”彼此之间的政策。据法新社报道，富尔在演说中曾谈到西方国家对中国的政策，他说：“西方三大国中只有一国已经承认共产党中国，这是不能设想的。而且中国在安全理事会中的席位仍然由台北（蒋介石）政府占据，这表明完全缺乏政治上现实的态度。”富尔关于中国的这些话，是在他为了要法国参议院批准巴黎协定，一面发出粗暴的威胁，一面又高唱在巴黎协定批准后“与苏联恢复谈判”的迷惑人心的论调时说出的。
