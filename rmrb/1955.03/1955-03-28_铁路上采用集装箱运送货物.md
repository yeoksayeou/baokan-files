Railroads have recently adopted a new method of container transport for goods. Starting March 11th, the Shenyang, Tianjin, and Shanghai stations have begun handling container transport services. This method quickly demonstrated its advantages and has been welcomed by cargo owners.

    A container is a large, movable metal box with a large volume. As long as the goods are not explosive, corrosive, flammable, or toxic, they can be loaded into these large boxes without packaging. This can greatly save on packaging materials and labor, and reduce freight costs. Railroads can also use flatcars instead of boxcars to transport less-than-carload (LCL) shipments.

    The method of container transport is now popular in the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and it will be widely adopted on our country's railroads in the future. (Xinhua News Agency)

    铁路上采用集装箱运送货物
    铁路上最近采用了一种新的集装箱运送货物的办法。三月十一日起，沈阳、天津和上海三个车站之间已经开始办理集装箱运送货物的业务。这种办法很快就显示了它的好处，受到货主欢迎。
    集装箱是一种体积较大的能够搬动的金属大箱子。只要不是容易爆炸、腐蚀、自燃和有毒的货物，都可以装在这种大箱子里，不需要包装。这样就可以大量节省包装货物的材料和人工，减少货物运费。铁路上也可以用平板车代替棚车运送零担货物。
    集装箱运送货物的办法现在在苏联和其他人民民主国家很流行，我国铁路上将来也要广泛采用。（新华社）
