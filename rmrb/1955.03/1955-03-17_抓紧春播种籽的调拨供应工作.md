    Seize the Work of Transferring and Supplying Spring Planting Seeds
    Hu Zhensheng
    As of now, the provinces have stored and are storing approximately one billion jin of spring planting seeds for crops such as grains and oilseeds. This is of great importance for supplying disaster areas and general areas for spring planting. However, in the current work of transferring and supplying seeds, how to ensure seed quality and achieve timely transfer and supply is a matter worth paying close attention to.
    In 1954, many areas were hit by disasters during the autumn harvest season. The seed quality in these areas is generally poor this year. For example, some seeds stored in Xingtai, Cangxian, and Shijiazhuang prefectures in Hebei Province this year have a germination rate of only 40% after inspection. Therefore, these areas should strictly carry out pre-supply inspections in this year's seed supply work, and re-examine the seeds that have been inspected in the past according to the situation to prevent supplying the masses with seeds of poor quality. In addition, for seeds transferred in large quantities from afar, the adaptability to the planting area should be considered in advance, and blind introduction or supply should be avoided. There have been many lessons in the past caused by losses due to blind introduction.
    This year, the area lacking seeds is relatively large, and the quantity of seeds to be supplied is large, making it a rather arduous task to ensure that the transfer of seeds is planned and timely. Based on past experience, to do this work well, all localities should earnestly investigate and grasp the actual situation of seed shortage among the masses, and then, according to actual needs, carry out transfer and supply early and in a planned manner. In 1954, some areas experienced chaotic phenomena in the transfer and supply work. For example, the Agricultural Section of Zhuanghe County, Liaoning Province, requested the province to supply 400,000 jin of soybean seeds, but in fact, even 200,000 jin were not used up. Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, did not use the "Jiangxi Late" rice seeds in stock and requested to be transferred from other places. These phenomena must be avoided. In order to ensure timely supply, all localities must transport the seeds to the seed-requiring locations a certain period of time before sowing, so that there is sufficient time to distribute and issue them to farmers for timely sowing.

    抓紧春播种籽的调拨供应工作
    胡振声
    截至目前为止，各省已经储备和正在储备的粮食、油料等作物的春播种籽约十亿斤。这对供应灾区和一般地区的春季播种是有很大作用的。但是在目前的种籽调拨、供应工作中，如何保证种籽质量和作到调拨、供应及时，却是一个值得十分注意的问题。
    一九五四年不少地区在秋收季节受到灾害的侵袭，这些地区今年的种籽质量一般较差。例如河北省邢台、沧县、石家庄等专区今年储备的种籽，经检查有的发芽率仅百分之四十。因此，这些地区在今年的种籽供应工作中应严格进行供应前的检查工作，对过去已经检查过的种籽，也应根据情况进行复查，防止把质量不好的种籽供给群众。此外由远途大量调运的种籽，还应事先考虑到它对种植地区的适应性，不要盲目引种或供应。由于盲目引种而造成损失的教训过去是很多的。
    今年缺种的面较广，供应种籽的数量较大，要使调拨种籽做到有计划和及时是一件相当繁重的任务。根据已往经验，要做好这项工作，各地应切实调查掌握群众缺种的实际情况，然后根据实际需要，及早地和有计划地进行调运和供应。一九五四年有些地区曾发生调运、供应工作混乱的现象，如辽宁省庄河县农业科，要求省里供应大豆种四十万斤，实际连二十万斤还没用完。江苏省江宁县库存“江西晚”稻种不用，而要求由外地调入。这些现象，必须避免。为了做到供应及时，各地必须在播种前的一定时间以前把种籽运达需种地点，以便能有充分时间分配发放，供给农民及时播种。
