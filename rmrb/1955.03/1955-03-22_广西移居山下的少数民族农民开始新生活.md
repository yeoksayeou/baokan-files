Minority farmers in Guangxi Province who have moved down the mountains are beginning to lead new lives. Since the winter of 1952, approximately 20,000 farmers throughout the province have moved down from the mountains. Many immigrants were destitute when they came down the mountain, but now they have built new homes; schools or health institutions have been established in many immigrant townships and villages. After eight Yao families in Shangsi County moved to the new area, with the help of the People's Government and local Zhuang and Han farmers, they built eight new houses, bought twelve oxen, and had enough furniture and farming tools to support themselves. All nine immigrant townships in Donglan County have established immigrant primary schools.
Most of the relocated farmers have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Last year, the Miao farmers who moved from Dashu Village in Longlin County participated in a mutual aid group, practiced deep plowing and careful cultivation, and increased grain production by more than 40%. This year, the group has been transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    广西移居山下的少数民族农民开始新生活
    广西全省移居山下的少数民族农民开始过着新的生活。自一九五二年冬到现在全省下山的农民约二万人左右。许多移民下山时一无所有，现在建起了新的家园；不少移民乡、村，设立了学校或卫生机构。上思县的八户瑶族农民移居新区后，两年来经人民政府和当地僮、汉族农民的帮助，盖了八座新房屋，买了十二条耕牛，并有了足够的家具和农具，生活可以自给了，东兰县的九个移民乡都成立了移民小学校。
    移居农民绝大部分都参加了互助合作组织，隆林县大树屯移居来的苗族农民去年参加互助组后，深耕细作，粮食增产四成多。今年，这个组已转成农业生产合作社。　（据新华社讯）
