"Emergency Measures" to Deceive the State

January 31, 1955 – It was the last day of January. In the morning, an emergency meeting was being held in the director's office of Tangshan Steel Plant, and the atmosphere was very heavy.

The January production plan for steel ingots in the converter workshop was still more than eighty tons short of completion. What to do? … Finally, the deputy director came up with an idea: the heads of each department should go back and study it further, and if necessary, some "emergency measures" could be taken.

After being "enlightened" by the deputy director, the head of the planning section did come up with a good idea. Soon, the workshop and the technical supervision section received a notice: "The state plan for January is tight, and the converter workshop's completion of the plan is in a state of tension. Therefore, with the approval of the factory director, the original time limit set by the higher authorities for the delivery of steel ingots to the warehouse is temporarily changed, and extended to 4:00 pm on February 1st. This change is only for January, and will not be repeated."

Wang Chonglun was running ahead of time, but the leading cadres of Tangshan Steel Plant insisted on pulling in February's time to do January's work.

On the morning of February 1st, after the clock had rung four times, the recorder's books showed that the converter workshop's steel ingot production plan for January was still one and a half tons short of completion.

That afternoon, the Tangshan Steel Plant laboratory suddenly received twenty-six steel ingot samples from the technical supervision section, saying that the director's office had notified them that these steel samples must be tested and the chemical composition reports sent before the end of the afternoon.

This unplanned task immediately kept the laboratory busy.

Why was there this urgent task? It turned out that at the coordination meeting in the director's office on the morning of February 1st, the leading cadres knew that yesterday's "emergency measures" had not saved the stalemate of failing to complete the task, and everyone was very annoyed. Finally, the deputy director decided to take a second "emergency measure." The leading cadres, headed by the deputy director, suddenly visited the scrap steel ingot pile. "Hmm, this one has a pretty good surface!" "Hey, that one has less sand!" "Look, here's one without cracks!"

After a period of selection, twenty-six scrap steel ingots were "promoted." Someone suggested that they be sent to the laboratory for an internal "physical examination" at full speed.

On the same day, the laboratory staff finally fulfilled their duties by analyzing the chemical composition of the twenty-six scrap steel ingots on time (the cost of medicines and labor alone was more than two million old currency). Unfortunately, the laboratory staff could only analyze the composition of the steel ingots, but could not turn the scrap steel ingots into qualified steel ingots. Therefore, the two "emergency measures" taken by the leading cadres of Tangshan Steel Plant still could not conceal the fact that "the converter workshop's steel ingot production plan was not completed in January."

Let's examine it! What is the nature of these "measures" taken by the leading cadres of Tangshan Steel Plant? Isn't it precisely an attempt to deceive the higher authorities and fraudulently obtain honor? If they put the effort they spent on this into examining the crux of the failure to complete the production plan and studying which weak links still exist in production management, it is certain that the consequences would be much better than they are now.　Pu Yinyao

    欺骗国家的“紧急措施”
    一九五五年一月三十一日——这是一月份的最后一天了。上午，唐山钢厂厂长室里正在开紧急会议，空气十分沉重。
    一月份，转炉车间钢锭的生产计划现在还差八十多吨没有完成，怎么办呢？……最后，副厂长拿出主意：各部门负责人回去再研究一下，必要时可以采取一些“紧急措施”。
  计划科长经过副厂长这样“启发”，果然想出了一个好主意。不久，车间和技术监督科就接到一份通知：“一月份国家计划较紧，而转炉车间完成计划的情况处于紧张状态。为此，经厂长批准，将原上级规定的钢锭交库时间临时变更，延长到二月一日四点钟止。这一变更只限于一月份，下不为例。”
    王崇伦跑在时间前面，而唐山钢厂的领导干部却硬要拉住二月份的时间来干一月份的活。
    二月一日早上，时钟已经响亮地敲了四下之后，记录员的账上一月份转炉车间钢锭的生产计划还差一吨半没有完成。
    这天下午，唐山钢厂化验室突然接到技术监督科送来二十六根钢锭的化验样品，说是厂长室通知：必须在下午下班以前把这些钢样化验完毕，把化学成份单送去。
    这个计划以外的任务，立刻使化验室忙碌起来。
    为什么会有这项紧急任务呢？原来二月一日上午在厂长室的碰头会议上，领导干部们知道昨天的那项“紧急措施”并没有挽救完不成任务的僵局，大家都很恼火。最后，副厂长又决定再采取第二项“紧急措施”。以副厂长为首的大小干部，突然光临到废钢锭堆边。“嗯，这一根表面还不错！”“嗨，那一根夹砂还少！”“瞧，这儿有一根没有裂纹的！”
    经过一阵挑选，二十六根废钢锭获得“提拔”了。不知是谁提了个意见，才火速把它们送往化验室进行内部的“体格检查”。
    当天，化验室的工作人员终于克尽厥职地按时把二十六根废钢锭的化学成份分析出来（仅药品和人工费花了旧币二百多万元）。不幸的是化验人员只能分析钢锭的成份，而不能把废钢锭变成合乎规格的钢锭。所以唐山钢厂领导干部的先后两项“紧急措施”毕竟还是掩盖不住“一月份没有完成转炉车间钢锭生产计划”的事实。
    检查一下吧！唐山钢厂领导干部的这些“措施”是什么性质？难道不正是企图欺蒙上级骗取荣誉吗？如果他们把花在这上面的心血，拿去检查完不成生产计划的症结和钻研生产管理上还存在着哪些薄弱环节，可以肯定，它的后果一定会比现在好些。　浦鄞耀
