    Henan Mi County is Improving the Cold Sheep Breed.
    The artificial insemination station for sheep in Mi County, Henan Province, plans to mate 1,200 cold sheep (a type of sheep) for farmers in 1955, nearly double the number in 1954. Currently, the cold sheep are approaching estrus, and the cadres of the station are signing contracts with local agricultural production cooperatives to ensure successful breeding and pregnancy. Mi County is a well-known cold sheep producing area in the country. This type of sheep has strong adaptability and fertility, and its wool is fine and crimped, suitable for weaving high-grade clothing materials such as navy serge. However, these sheep are small in size and have low wool yields. In order to meet the needs of China's wool textile industry, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry established an artificial insemination station for sheep in Yunyang Palace, Mi County, in 1953, and transported five head of excellent Soviet Stavropol sheep (this type of sheep has thick, dense, fine, and long wool, with an annual yield of about 30 kilograms). In 1954, the station mated more than 600 local cold sheep, with a conception rate of 85%, which is even higher than the natural mating conception rate. Natural mating generally produces only one lamb, with occasional twins. Many artificially inseminated ewes have already produced twins, and some have even produced triplets. The first generation of hybrid lambs is more than one-third heavier than cold sheep lambs, and the crimp of the wool is very obvious, with increased density. The hybrid lamb of Zhang Jinhao in Hekou Village, Hehe Township, produced 2.5 jin of wool in three months, which is equal to the annual yield of ordinary cold sheep (about one year old). It is estimated that the wool production of the first generation of hybrid sheep can be more than twice that of cold sheep.

    河南密县改良寒羊品种
    河南省密县绵羊人工授精站一九五五年计划为农民交配寒羊（绵羊的一种）一千二百只，较一九五四年增加近一倍。目前寒羊已临发情期，该站干部正同当地农业生产合作社签订配种保胎合同。密县是全国著名的寒羊产区。这种羊适应性和繁殖力强，毛细、曲，可织海军呢等高级衣料。但这种羊体型小，毛产量低。为适应我国毛纺工业的需要，河南省农林厅于一九五三年在密县云岩宫设立了绵羊人工授精站，并运来苏联斯坦夫罗波优良羊种五头（这种羊毛厚密细长、年产量达三十公斤左右）。一九五四年，该站为当地寒羊交配六百多只，受胎率达百分之八十五，较自然交配受胎率还高一些。自然交配一般只产一羔，个别双羔。人工授精的母羊不少已产双羔，个别有产三羔的。杂交第一代羊羔，体重较寒羊羊羔重三分之一强，毛的弯曲度很明显，密度增加。和合乡河口村张金好的杂交羊羔，三个月已产毛二斤五两，等于当地一般寒羊成羊（长一年左右）的全年产量。估计杂交一代羊的羊毛产量可较寒羊增加两倍多。
