    Surveying of Wasteland in the Qaidam Basin Begins
    More than 200 technicians and workers surveying wasteland and prospecting and designing irrigation projects in the Qaidam Basin have completed their preparations and will depart in batches at the beginning of March. The wasteland survey team will survey the area from Golmud to Lake Gazikule in the western Qaidam Basin. This year, they plan to survey an area of 2,000 square kilometers of wasteland, of which an estimated 750,000 mu will be arable. The prospecting and design teams for the Golmud and Utumeiren irrigation projects will develop water conservancy project plans for these two areas this year. Efforts will be made to start construction on the Golmud irrigation project this autumn. After the completion of these two irrigation projects, the irrigated area can reach 1.2 million mu.
    The Qaidam Basin has large areas of wasteland available for reclamation and cultivation. According to a key survey conducted by the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry last year, there are approximately 31 million mu of reclaimable wasteland in the Qaidam Basin, which is equivalent to five times the existing cultivated land in Qinghai Province. The soil is mostly grey desert calcisol; the soil layer is generally between five decimeters and five meters thick; the frost-free period is about 120 days. Last year, the more than 8,000 mu of wheat cultivated by the Delingha Farm yielded an average of 300 jin per mu. (Xinhua News Agency)

    柴达木盆地荒地开始查勘
    查勘柴达木盆地的荒地和勘测设计灌溉工程的二百多技术人员和工人已做好准备工作，三月初就要分批出发。荒地查勘队将在柴达木盆地西部格尔穆到格孜库勒湖一带查勘。他们今年计划查勘的荒地面积为二千平方公里，其中可耕地预计可达七十五万亩。格尔穆和乌图美仁灌溉工程勘测设计队，今年就要作出这两个地区的水利工程规划设计。格尔穆灌溉工程争取在今年秋季动工。这两处灌溉工程修成后，灌溉面积可达到一百二十万亩。
    柴达木盆地有着大片的荒地可供开垦播种。据青海省农林厅去年重点查勘推算，柴达木盆地内可垦荒地约有三千一百多万亩，相等于青海省现有耕地的五倍。土壤大多是灰漠钙土；土层一般在五公寸到五公尺之间；无霜期达一百二十天左右。去年德令哈农场垦种的八千多亩小麦，平均每亩收了三百斤。　（新华社讯）
