    Erling Electric Irrigation Area

    Leaving the east gate of Danyang city, and heading south along the Danyang to Jintan highway, one enters the Erling Electric Irrigation Area. Along the way, one can see rows of iron towers for high-voltage power lines, standing tall; along the ridges of the fields, irrigation canals are everywhere.

    Not far from the highway is the Erdu River. In the past, it was difficult to draw water from the river, so it never played a role in farmland irrigation. In the spring of 1953, the People's Government built eight power stations along the river, installing twenty-seven vertical propeller pumps with a total of seventy-five horsepower, and one hundred and fourteen concrete culverts. The Erling Electric Irrigation Station was officially established. Since then, 90% of the cultivated land in the area has been irrigated, and the area planted with rice has increased from the original 54% to 67.7%.

    The reporter visited the second and sixth electric irrigation stations. At that time, the water pumps were working, drawing water through twelve-inch-wide iron pipes into canals more than two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) above the river surface. The rushing torrent flowed in all directions through main canals, branch canals, and distribution canals. Each pump could draw a minimum of 60,000 jin (30,000 kg) of water per minute, and all the machines together could irrigate 1,620 mu (approximately 108 hectares) of rice paddies per hour.

    In 1953, due to the enormous role that electric irrigation played in combating drought, the total grain output in the area increased by 8 million jin (4,000,000 kg) compared to 1952, equivalent to 6.4 billion old Renminbi. The average income of farmers in the area increased by about 100,000 yuan per person. In 1954, both wheat and early soybeans had bumper harvests. Although the autumn rice crop suffered an unprecedentedly severe flood, rice production still slightly increased compared to the previous year.

    With the development of electric irrigation, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Erling area has also flourished. In 1952, there was only one agricultural production cooperative in the area. Now, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the area has grown to more than 200, with cooperative members accounting for 55% of the total number of households; households participating in mutual aid groups account for 20% of the total number of households. Nine of the fourteen townships in the area have basically achieved cooperativization.

    The farmers of the Erling area are happy, and they know the source of this happiness. In 1954, the amount of wheat sold by the farmers of the Erling area to the state increased by 44% compared to 1953, and the amount of early soybeans sold to the state increased by nearly seven times compared to the total amount of early and late soybeans sold in 1953. The farmers of the Erling area understand that only by obeying the state plan, increasing grain production, and supporting socialist construction can they obtain greater happiness.

    珥陵电力灌溉区
    甄群
    出丹阳城东门，沿着丹阳到金坛的公路向南，便进入珥陵电力灌溉区。一路上可以看到一列列的高压输电线的铁架，冲天矗立；路旁的田埂上，到处横卧着灌溉渠道。
    离公路不远，就是珥渎河，过去因为从河中取水困难，所以，它对农田灌溉从来就没有起什么作用。一九五三年春天，人民政府顺着这条河建立了八个电力站，设立二十七部七十五匹马力的立式螺桨式的抽水机，和一百十四座水泥建筑的涵闸。珥陵电力灌溉站正式建立起来了。从此，全区占百分之九十的耕地都受到了灌溉，全区水稻种植面积由原来的百分之五十四，扩大到百分之六十七点七。
    记者参观了第二、第六两个电力灌溉站。那时，抽水机正在工作，水被十二吋宽的铁管子抽到离河面二丈多高的渠道中来，滔滔的急流，通过干渠、支渠、分渠流到四方，每台抽水机每分钟最低能抽水六万斤，全部机器每小时能灌溉一千六百二十亩稻田。
    一九五三年，由于电力灌溉在抗旱中发生巨大作用，全区粮食比一九五二年增产八百万斤。约合旧人民币六十四亿元，全区农民平均每人增加收入十万元左右。一九五四年小麦和早黄豆都丰收，秋禾虽然遭到空前特大洪水，而水稻产量仍比前年略有增加。
    随着电力灌溉的发展，珥陵区的互助合作运动也蓬勃发展。一九五二年，全区只有一个农业生产合作社，现在全区的农业生产合作社已发展到二百多个，入社农户占总户数的百分之五十五；参加互助组的农户占总户数的百分之二十，全区十四个乡已有九个乡基本上合作化。
    珥陵区农民是幸福的，他们知道这种幸福的来源。一九五四年，珥陵区农民卖给国家的小麦比一九五三年增加百分之四十四，卖给国家的早黄豆比一九五三年卖出早豆和晚豆的总数增加近七倍。珥陵区的农民懂得只有服从国家计划，增产更多的粮食支援社会主义建设，才能得到更大的幸福。
