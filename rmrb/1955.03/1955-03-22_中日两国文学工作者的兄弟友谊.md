    The Brotherly Friendship of Chinese and Japanese Literary Workers
    By Japanese Literary Critic Iwagami Junichi
    Some time ago, we visited Lu Xun's former residence, and many things moved us. The streets and alleys near the former residence did not look like where wealthy people lived, but rather like the residences of middle-class people in Beijing in the past. Mr. Lu Xun seemed to like living among these poor people, and from this, it can be seen that Mr. Lu Xun was willing to be close to the masses. The house is simple and clean. Just by looking at the writing room called "Tiger's Tail," one can fully understand how simple Lu Xun's daily life was. Looking at the guest room where Lu Xun used to talk with students and young people and spread revolutionary ideas, one can clearly imagine how those who were influenced by Lu Xun's thoughts later acted. What particularly moved us from the bottom of our hearts was that Lu Xun's collection of books spanned ancient and modern China and foreign countries. He kept Japanese literature, history, and science books in an entire room, which cannot but amaze us and further arouse our respect for him. Lu Xun's research on Japanese culture was more in-depth than ours; Lu Xun's understanding of Japanese progressive literature was more extensive than ours. On the wall of Lu Xun's writing room hung a photo of his teacher during his time studying medicine in Japan, which once again stirred my heartstrings. Lu Xun's former residence is truly the most valuable memorial hall in the history of cultural and literary exchanges between China and Japan. It can be said that the literary career of Lu Xun, the great predecessor of modern Chinese culture and literature, is the most glorious torch illuminating the history of progressive literary exchanges between China and Japan.
    In fact, Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" has had a profound impact on many Japanese readers since it was translated into Japanese. Today, when Japan is occupied by the United States, not only readers with progressive ideas, but even ordinary—almost all Japanese people—can more deeply understand Ah Q's suffering and joy. Lu Xun's works are increasingly becoming a great force to encourage the Japanese people today.
    It is not only "The True Story of Ah Q." When almost all of Lu Xun's works were translated into Japanese—around 1930—it was the most developed period of the Japanese proletarian literary movement. At that time, although international connections with Chinese progressive writers were difficult, many paths were still opened up. Japanese progressive writers carefully watched the works of Chinese progressive writers in Shanghai and Beijing, headed by Lu Xun, and cared about their activities. Moreover, many Japanese proletarian literary works described the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. These include: Murayama Tomoyoshi's four-act play "Violence Gang Record" (1929), which describes the strike struggle of the Beijing-Hankou Railway workers in 1923; Maeda Kōichirō's play "Chiang Kai-shek" (1929), which exposes Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the Chinese people; and Ema Shū's "Opium War" (1929) and Kuroshima Denji's "Armed City" (1930), etc. In November 1930, the resolution made by the Second International Conference of the International Union of Revolutionary Writers held in Kharkov, Soviet Union, on the Japanese Proletarian Writers' League stated: "Due to the common language, geographical proximity, and close political and economic relations between Japan and China, there has always been a relatively close connection in the field of proletarian literary movements, but it has not yet developed into an organized relationship." It urged progressive literary workers in China and Japan to exchange experiences and cooperate with each other. The exchange of experiences and mutual cooperation between progressive literary workers in China and Japan failed to develop fully due to the increasingly intensified suppression by Japanese imperialists before and after the provocation of the "September 18th Incident." However, even so, Mr. Guo Moruo was still in Japan studying ancient Chinese culture during this period; in February 1933, the Japanese revolutionary writer Takiji Kobayashi was brutally murdered by the police, and Lu Xun sent a telegram of condolence; in addition, the Japanese progressive writer Wataru Kajichi studied Chinese literature in Shanghai under the guidance of Lu Xun. It is said that he also participated in the funeral when Lu Xun passed away.
    In 1934, the Japanese Proletarian Writers' League was dissolved, and progressive literary workers were dispersed into small-scale organizations, publishing publications such as "Literary Criticism." After this publication was also forced to cease publication, Japanese progressive literary workers individually wrote for bourgeois publications, carrying out the minimum resistance to the war of aggression. However, later even this was impossible. Due to suppression, many writers had to superficially express "transformation," and many writers and poets were either banned from writing or arrested and imprisoned.
    In 1945, Japanese imperialism failed, and Japan fell into the hands of American occupiers. Progressive literary workers reunited around the New Japan Literary Society, and relations with Soviet literature and Chinese literature began to move towards a new path of development. Japanese progressive literary workers read Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice," and other works, began to realize that literary work must follow the mass line, and more deeply recognized the task of literature serving the masses, and began to work hard to establish a united front for literature to strive for peace and democracy.
    Between 1946 and 1950, Japanese progressive literary workers wrote many works that contributed to the struggle for peace, democracy, and against war. It can be said that these works more or less criticized the past war of aggression against China and reflected the Japanese people's desire for peace. Tokunaga Sunao's "Lover, Rest in Peace!" and "Dawn Wind" describe the suffering of the Japanese people in the war of aggression and their desire for liberation, while his "Quiet Mountains" is an excellent anti-war and pro-peace work with the ideological awakening process of the Japanese working people after the war as its theme. Miyamoto Yuriko's "Banshu Plain," "Kazeshirigusa," "Two Gardens," and "Milestone," although having the shortcomings of formalistic preoccupation with trivial matters around her, still have high value as works exploring the process of the revolutionization of intellectuals.
    In 1950, many Communist Party leading cadres in the New Japan Literary Society participated in erroneous secessionist activities. Therefore, "People's Literature" was founded with Communist Party writers who had not participated in the secessionist activities as the core, learning from the experience of the Chinese literary movement. "People's Literature" mainly aimed to cultivate and develop mass literature of workers and peasants, and translated and introduced many works and reviews by Chinese writers. In 1953, the secessionists finally conducted self-criticism, recognized the Party's program, and began to return to the Party's ranks. Thus, "New Japan Literature" and "People's Literature" also began to eliminate the state of opposition, changed the task of "People's Literature" to cultivating young workers and peasant literary workers, and renamed it "Literary Friends," which is still being published.
    The reason why the internal divisions of Japanese progressive literature could begin to be eliminated and re-tend towards unity is primarily because people from all walks of life ardently hoped to unite to strive for peace, democracy, and independence. At the same time, the influence of Soviet literature and Chinese literature also played a significant role in promoting this. That is, during this period, Japan translated and introduced Chinese new literary works such as "Xia Qiu Biography," "Prairie Fire," "Primary Power," "Changes in Li Family Village," "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," "In the Face of New Things," "Four Generations Under One Roof," "Dragon Beard Ditch," "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," "The Hurricane," etc., and also translated the resolutions of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers and the Second Congress of Chinese Literary Workers into Japanese, so that Japanese progressive literary workers were deeply inspired and gained courage from these works, and conducted self-criticism ideologically and creatively.
    The positive literary images created by Soviet literature and Chinese literature advancing along the path of socialist realism are a guide for the creation of Japanese progressive writers. From 1950 to today, Japanese progressive writers have written some works against war and demanding peace, creating positive images of the masses of people struggling for national liberation. Tokunaga Sunao's "Quiet Mountains" Part II, Takakura Teru's "Hakone Fūunroku", Matsuda Tokiko's "People Underground," Ashigara Sadano's "The Voice of the Railroad," Harukawa Tetsuo's "Japanese Workers," etc., are all works describing the working people's opposition to war and demand for peace; in addition, Nakano Shigeharu's "Internal Organs," Sata Ineko's "Green Tree-Lined Road," Kim Dal-soo's "Genkai Sea," etc., are all works with the theme of intellectuals' struggle against war and demand for peace. Of course, these works still have many shortcomings in writing methods, but it can be said that they have played a role in defending peace and raising national consciousness. We only learned during our visit to Beijing that some of these works have already been translated and introduced in China, and that there are plans to translate more Japanese literary works in the future.
    When we arrived in Beijing, Mr. Xiao San welcomed us by saying:
  "I hope you stay here as if you have returned to your own home!" I believe that this sentence was not only addressed to Tokunaga Sunao and me, but to all Japanese literary workers, no, to all the Japanese people. I firmly believe that the literatures of China and Japan must become fraternal brothers, helping and encouraging each other, making them literature that strengthens and consolidates peace and the independence and friendship of all nations. Our literature must develop in this direction, and it will definitely develop in this direction!

    中日两国文学工作者的兄弟友谊
    日本文艺批评家　岩上顺一
    前些日子，我们访问了鲁迅故居，很多事情都使我们感动。故居附近的街巷，看起来不像是富贵人家住的地方，倒像是过去北京的中等人家居住的处所。鲁迅先生似乎是喜欢生活在这些贫穷的人们之中，从这里也能看出鲁迅先生是愿意经常接近人民群众的。故居的房屋简朴而清洁。只要一看那叫做“老虎尾巴”的写作室，就会完全明了鲁迅先生的日常生活是多么朴素了。看看鲁迅先生平日和学生、青年们谈话、传播革命思想的客室，也能够清楚地想见这些受了鲁迅先生思想影响的人们后来是怎样活动的。特别使我们从心底受到感动的是，鲁迅先生的藏书遍及古今中外，以整整一个房间收藏着日本的文学、历史、科学书籍，这不能不使我们惊叹不已，不能不进一步引起我们对他的尊敬。鲁迅先生对日本文化的研究，比我们更深入；鲁迅先生对日本进步文学的了解，比我们更广泛。鲁迅先生写作室的墙壁上，挂着他在日本学医时代的教师的照片，这再一次使我的心弦为之激动。鲁迅故居真是一座中日文化、文学交流历史的最有价值的纪念馆。可以说，现代中国文化和文学的伟大前辈鲁迅先生的文学生涯，是照耀中日进步文学交流历史的最光辉的火炬。
    事实上，鲁迅先生的“阿Q正传”，自从翻译成日文后，一直到今天，给了许多日本读者深刻的影响。当日本被美国占领的今天，不仅是具有进步思想的读者，就连一般——几乎是所有的日本人民，也都能够更深刻地理解阿Q的苦恼和喜悦。鲁迅先生的作品，今天越来越成为鼓舞日本人民的巨大力量了。
    不仅仅是“阿Q正传”，当鲁迅先生的几乎全部的作品翻译成日文的时候——一九三○年前后，正是日本无产阶级文学运动最为发展的时期。当时，和中国进步作家的国际联系，虽然是在困难之中，但也还是打开了许多条道路。日本的进步作家们，认真地注视着以鲁迅先生为首的上海和北京的中国进步作家的作品，关怀他们的活动，而且日本也有不少的无产阶级文学作品描写了中国人民反帝、反封建的斗争。这就是：村山知义的四幕剧“暴力团记”（一九二九年），描写了一九二三年京汉铁路员工的罢工斗争；前田河广一郎的剧本“蒋介石”（一九二九年），揭露了蒋介石的背叛中国人民；还有江马修的“鸦片战争”（一九二九年）和黑岛传治的“武装了的城市”（一九三○年）等等。一九三○年十一月，在苏联哈尔科夫举行的国际革命作家同盟第二次国际会议作出的对日本无产阶级作家同盟的决议认为：“由于日本和中国之间文字相通，地理接近以及政治、经济关系密切，在无产阶级文学运动的领域中，虽然从来就有着较为密切的联系，但是还没有发展成为有组织的关系。”而敦促中日两国进步文学工作者交流经验和互相合作。中日两国进步文学工作者的交流经验和互相合作，由于日本帝国主义者在挑起“九一八”事变前后日益加强了的镇压而未能得到充分发展。可是，即便如此，在这期间，郭沫若先生也还在日本研究中国古代文化；一九三三年二月日本革命作家小林多喜二遭到警察残杀，鲁迅先生还致电吊唁；此外日本进步作家鹿地亘曾在上海，在鲁迅先生指导下学习中国文学，据说，鲁迅先生逝世时，他还参加了送殡。
    一九三四年，日本无产阶级作家同盟解散，进步文学工作者分散成为小规模的组织，出版了“文学评论”等刊物；到了这个刊物也被迫停刊之后，日本进步文学工作者就各自分散地给资产阶级刊物写稿，向侵略战争进行最低限度的抵抗。可是，后来连这些也不可能了，由于镇压，许多作家不得不在表面上表示“转向”，而且，有不少的作家和诗人，或被禁止写作，或被逮捕入狱。
    一九四五年，日本帝国主义失败，日本落到美国占领者手中的时候，进步文学工作者又团结在新日本文学会周围，而和苏联文学、中国文学的关系，又开始向着新的发展道路前进。日本进步文学工作者阅读了毛泽东的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、“矛盾论”和“实践论”及其他著作，开始认识到文学工作必须走群众路线，更深刻地认识了文学必须为人民群众服务的任务，而开始为建立争取和平、民主的文学统一战线努力。
    一九四六年到一九五○年之间，日本进步文学工作者写了不少作品，对争取和平、民主和反对战争作出了贡献。可以说，这些作品或多或少地对过去侵略中国的战争进行了批评，反映了日本人民的和平愿望。德永直的“爱人啊，安息吧！”和“黎明的风”是描写侵略战争中日本人民遭受的苦难和对解放的愿望，而他的“静静的群山”则是以战后日本劳动人民的思想觉悟过程为主题的、优秀的反对战争、宣传和平的作品。宫本百合子的“播州原野”、“风知草”、“两个院子”、“路标”等，虽然是有着在形式上拘泥于身边琐事的缺点，但是作为探求知识分子革命化过程的作品来说，还是具有很高价值的。
    到了一九五○年，新日本文学会内不少共产党员领导干部，参加了错误的分裂活动，因此，即以未参加分裂活动的共产党员作家为核心创刊了“人民文学”，学习中国文学运动的经验。“人民文学”主要以培养和发展工农大众文学为目的，翻译和介绍了中国作家的许多作品和评论。一九五三年，分裂分子终于进行了自我批评，承认了党的纲领而开始回到党的队伍中来，于是“新日本文学”和
  “人民文学”也就开始消除对立的状态，将“人民文学”的任务改为培养青年工人和农民文学工作者，并改名为“文学之友”，目前仍在继续出刊。
    日本进步文学内部的分歧所以能开始消除而重新趋于团结，首先是由于各阶层人民热烈地希望为争取和平、民主和独立而团结起来，同时，苏联文学、中国文学的影响也起了很大的推动作用。这就是，在这个时期，日本翻译和介绍了中国新文学作品“虾球传”、“平原烈火”、“原动力”、“李家庄的变迁”、“小二黑结婚”、“在新事物的面前”、“四世同堂”、“龙须沟”、“太阳照在桑干河上”、“暴风骤雨”等等，而且又把中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会和中国文学工作者第二次代表大会的决议文件译成日文，使得日本的进步文学工作者从这些作品中受到了深刻的启发，得到了勇气，而从思想上和创作上进行了自我批判。
    沿着社会主义现实主义道路前进的苏联文学和中国文学所创造的积极的文学形象，对于日本进步作家的创作来说，乃是前进的指针。从一九五○年到今天，日本进步作家写出了一些反对战争、要求和平的作品，创造了为争取民族解放而斗争的人民群众的积极的形象。德永直的“静静的群山”第二部、高仓辉的“箱根风云录”、松田解子的“地底下的人们”、足柄定之的“铁路之声”、春川铁男的“日本劳动者”等等，都是描写劳动人民反对战争要求和平的作品；此外，中野重治的“五脏六腑”、佐多稻子的“绿色的林荫道”、金达寿的“玄海滩”等都是以知识分子反对战争、要求和平的斗争为主题的作品。当然，这些作品在写作方法上还有不少缺点，但是，可以说，它们都在保卫和平、提高民族自觉方面发挥了作用。我们这次访问北京才知道，这些作品有一部分中国已经翻译和介绍了，而且今后还计划翻译更多的日本文学作品。
    我们到达北京的时候，萧三先生欢迎我们说：
  “希望你们像回到自己家里一样地住下来吧！”我相信这句话不单单是对德永直和我说的，而是对日本所有的文学工作者，不、是对日本全体人民说的。我坚决地相信：中日两国文学必须成为同胞兄弟，互相帮助、互相鞭策，使之成为加强并巩固和平和各民族的独立与友谊的文学，我们的文学要向这个方向发展，而且一定会向这个方向发展！
