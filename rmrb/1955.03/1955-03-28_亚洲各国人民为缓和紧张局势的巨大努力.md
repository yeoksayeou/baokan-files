Asiatic Countries Conference for the relaxation of international tensions, initiated by the Indian delegation and unanimously approved by the representatives of Asian countries attending the conference at the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions held in Stockholm last June, has been decided to be held in New Delhi, India, from April 6 to 10, after the joint efforts and active preparations of social figures from Asian countries. This is another demonstration of the great efforts made by peace-loving people of Asian countries to defend Asian peace and ease the Asian situation. I believe that peace-loving people in Asian and even world countries will express warm welcome and support for the convening of this conference.

Since its initiation, the Asian Countries Conference has been widely responded to by social figures in Asian countries. Many countries have established preparatory bodies with broad representation and nominated representatives to attend the conference. This fully expresses the common desire and strong demand of the people of Asian countries to safeguard peace, ease the situation, and enhance friendship and unity with each other. This conference, as pointed out in the communique issued by the Secretariat of the International Preparatory Committee of the Asian Countries Conference on the convening of the conference, "will provide an opportunity to exchange views on common issues concerning Asia. This exchange of views will help the people of Asian countries reach further common understanding and close contact in all aspects, thereby helping to ease the current world tension."

Today, the people of Asia are facing such a situation: on the one hand, the United States is intensifying its frantic war threats; on the other hand, the people of Asian countries are more firmly united and united to oppose new war threats. After the end of the Korean and Indochina wars, hope for peace appeared in Asia. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated in the joint statements of China and India, and China and Burma, have promoted the people of all countries to expand the peaceful region of Asia. The Asian-African Conference initiated by Asian countries to promote goodwill and cooperation and to establish and enhance friendly and neighborly relations is also about to be held. All these advances in peaceful efforts reflect the strong will of the people of Asian countries to oppose foreign aggression and war policies. The people of Asian countries will never allow war conspiracies to succeed, and are determined to continue to unswervingly undertake the lofty cause of opposing aggression and defending peace.

We, the people of Asian countries, have carried out a long and arduous struggle to strive for a peaceful life and national independence and freedom. We have seen our invincible strength and found our bright and happy path. The people of Asia, with a long history, love independence and freedom, and love the culture left by their motherland. We, the 1.4 billion people of Asia, must love each other, respect each other, and help each other, and turn Asian countries into a harmonious family. We will no longer allow imperialists to interfere and oppress us, nor will we allow them to use our land as a battlefield and our people as cannon fodder! Today, the people of Asian countries, who have stood up and awakened, have the confidence and strength to jointly oppose war and hatred, and to oppose all the evil activities of the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism in using atomic weapons, organizing military alliances that divide Asian countries, and establishing foreign military bases in Asia and interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries!

The people of Asian countries have seen with joy and excitement the heroic behavior of their Korean and Vietnamese brothers in fighting against imperialist aggression and defending peace, national independence and freedom.

We, the peace-loving people of China, attach great importance to the convening of the Asian Countries Conference and give it warm support. The Chinese people have always strived for peace in Asia and the world and have always unswervingly adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At present, our struggle to liberate our territory Taiwan is also a struggle to oppose the warmongers of the United States in creating tension in the Far East, expanding aggression, and preparing to launch a new war. This is entirely in line with the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

We firmly believe that this grand meeting of social figures from Asian countries, with the unanimous support of the people of Asian countries and the joint efforts of the participating representatives, will contribute to promoting peace in Asia and the world, easing tensions, and enhancing unity and friendship among the people of Asian countries. I sincerely wish the conference a complete success.

    亚洲各国人民为缓和紧张局势的巨大努力
    中华全国总工会副主席  刘宁一
      去年六月在斯德哥尔摩举行缓和局势国际会议时，由印度代表团提出并得到与会亚洲各国代表一致赞同发起的为缓和亚洲局势的亚洲国家会议，经过亚洲国家社会人士的共同努力和积极筹备，已决定于四月六日到十日在印度新德里召开。这是亚洲各国爱好和平人士为保卫亚洲和平、缓和亚洲局势所作的又一次巨大努力的表现。我相信，亚洲以至世界各国爱好和平人民对这个会议的召开都将表示热烈的欢迎和支持。
    亚洲国家会议自从发起以来，就得到亚洲各国广泛的社会人士的响应，许多国家纷纷成立了具有广泛代表性的筹备机构，推选代表准备参加大会。这就充分表达了亚洲各国人民对于保卫和平、和缓局势和增进彼此间的友谊团结的共同愿望和强烈要求。这次会议，正如亚洲国家会议国际筹备委员会秘书处发表的关于召开会议的公报中所指出的，“将是提供一个就有关亚洲的共同问题交换意见的机会。这种意见交换将有助于使亚洲各国人民在各方面达成进一步的共同谅解和进行密切联系，从而有助于缓和目前世界紧张局势”。
    今天，亚洲人民正面临着这样一种形势：一方面美国在加紧进行疯狂的战争威胁；一方面亚洲各国人民却更坚定地团结和联合起来反对新的战争威胁。朝鲜和印度支那战争终止后，亚洲出现了和平的希望。中印、中缅联合声明所倡导的和平共处五项原则，推动了各国人民来扩大亚洲的和平地区。在亚洲国家发起下为促进亲善和合作、建立和增进友好和睦邻关系的亚非会议也即将举行。所有这些和平努力的进展，都反映了亚洲各国人民反对外来侵略和战争政策的坚强意志。亚洲各国人民决不容许战争阴谋得逞，并决心继续不懈地担当起反对侵略、保卫和平的崇高事业。
    我们亚洲各国人民，为争取和平生活和民族的独立自由进行了长期而艰巨的斗争。我们已经看到了自己不可战胜的力量，找到了自己光明和幸福的道路。有着悠久历史的亚洲人民，是热爱独立自由，热爱自己祖国所遗留下来的文化的。我们十四亿亚洲人民要互相友爱，互相尊重和互相帮助，把亚洲各国变成和睦的大家庭。我们再也不准帝国主义者来干涉和压迫我们，再也不准它们把我们的国土作战场，把我们的人民作炮灰！今天，已经站起来和觉醒了的亚洲各国人民，是有信心和力量来共同反对战争和仇视，反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团使用原子武器、组织分裂亚洲国家的军事联盟以及在亚洲建立外国军事基地和干涉亚洲国家内政的一切罪恶活动！
    亚洲各国人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情，看到了自己的朝鲜和越南兄弟在反对帝国主义侵略，保卫和平和祖国独立自由的战斗中所表现的英勇行为。
    我们爱好和平的中国人民，对于亚洲国家会议的召开极为重视并予以热烈的支持。中国人民一贯为亚洲和世界和平努力并始终不渝地坚持和平共处的五项原则。目前我们为解放自己的领土台湾而进行的斗争，也正是为反对美国好战分子制造远东紧张局势、扩大侵略、准备发动新的战争的斗争，这是完全符合亚洲和世界和平利益的。
    我们深信，这次亚洲国家社会人士的盛大会议，在亚洲各国人民一致支持和与会代表的共同努力下，将对促进亚洲和世界和平、缓和紧张局势、增进亚洲各国人民间的团结友好作出贡献。我衷心祝贺大会获得圆满成功。
