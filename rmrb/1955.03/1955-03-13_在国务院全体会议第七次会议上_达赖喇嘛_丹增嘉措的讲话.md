The political, economic, and cultural connections between the Tibetan people and the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups have a history of over a thousand years. However, during the rule of successive dynasties, the Tibetan people were subjected to oppression through the use of power. In particular, the Kuomintang reactionaries engaged in various conspiracies to create disunity among the fraternal ethnic groups and within the Tibetan ethnicity itself. At the same time, foreign imperialists carried out armed aggression against Tibet or used deceptive tactics, single-mindedly seeking to make Tibet their perpetual slave. It is precisely because of this long-term experience of oppression and exploitation by internal and external powers that we find ourselves in a state of extreme backwardness and poverty. Just as we were approaching this dead end, the Chinese people's revolution, led by the Chinese Communist Party, achieved a great victory. After the signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, the Tibetan people were forever freed from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the great family of the motherland.

In the past three years or more, the People's Liberation Army and personnel entering Tibet, in the process of assisting Tibet in various constructions and work, according to Chairman Mao's great policy of ethnic unity and equality, have consulted with Tibetan religious and secular workers and the people on all matters, large and small, and gradually implemented them according to their wishes. On this basis of benefiting Tibet and thus gaining trust, the old influences of the past estrangement between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups have been gradually eliminated. This has given me great encouragement. With extremely joyful feelings, I came to the capital of the motherland, Beijing, last year, representing the Tibetan religious and secular people to attend the National People's Congress meeting and met our great leader Chairman Mao and other leaders. At the National People's Congress meeting, I enjoyed the right to ethnic equality, participated in the discussion and formulation of the constitution, and elected national leaders. After successfully completing these tasks, when I visited major cities across the country, I was sincerely welcomed and received by people from all walks of life and all fraternal ethnic groups in various regions, and I personally witnessed the results of the united efforts of the fraternal ethnic groups to build the motherland. In just a few years, the people's political, economic, cultural, and other aspects of life have undergone great development, and indescribable achievements have been made in light industry, heavy industry, and other construction undertakings. At the same time, famous temples in various large and small cities that had dilapidated or collapsed have been renovated by the central government, and all male and female believers, regardless of their religion, are protected by law and are not interfered with, specifically realizing the constitutional provisions regarding freedom of religious belief. These are all facts that I have personally witnessed.

Our motherland is a country with vast land, a large population, and abundant resources. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, on the basis of unprecedentedly consolidated equality and unity among all ethnic groups, the common and concerted efforts to develop construction undertakings have made the motherland like a vibrant flower, increasingly moving towards prosperity and strength. Therefore, we sincerely believe that our motherland will surely victoriously move towards a socialist society. We Tibetan people feel honored and proud to be members of the great family of the motherland. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, and with the help of the advanced Han ethnicity, the Tibetan people will surely build a happy and prosperous new Tibet.

During our stay in Beijing this time, according to Chairman Mao's profound instructions, regarding internal affairs in Tibet, such as the unified establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region by the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, and the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee; matters in which the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee requested the State Council to help with construction; the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee jointly resolving long-standing unresolved issues; the Tibetan Local Government's paper money issue; and the matters requesting assistance regarding the reorganization of the Tibetan army, can be discussed, revised, and decided at today's meeting. We will gladly support and abide by these decisions, strengthen the unity among all fraternal ethnic groups, especially between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, as well as within the Tibetan people, and successfully carry out the work of building Tibet. The Tibetan people will, together with the people of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country, do everything possible to build a great motherland, defend world peace, oppose the US imperialist policy of aggressive war, and liberate our territory of Taiwan!

Regarding the detailed matters since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, I have entrusted Galoon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme to make a report to the meeting on behalf of the Tibetan Local Government, hoping for criticism and guidance.

    在国务院全体会议第七次会议上
    达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措的讲话
    西藏人民同汉族以及其他兄弟民族间发生政治上、经济上以及文化上的联系已经有千多年的历史。但在历代的皇朝统治时期，却对西藏人民实行强权压迫，尤其国民党反动派以种种阴谋制造各兄弟民族间以及西藏民族内部的不团结；同时外国帝国主义又对西藏实行武装侵略，或施以诱骗手段，一心想使西藏永远做它们的奴隶。正是由于这种长期经受内外强权压迫和剥削的事实，使我们处于极度落后和贫困的境地。正在这日趋穷途之际，中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命取得了伟大的胜利，在一九五一年签订和平解放西藏办法的协议以后，西藏人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊回到了祖国大家庭中。
    在过去三年多的时间中，进藏人民解放军和工作人员在帮助西藏进行各项建设和工作的过程中，根据毛主席的伟大的民族团结平等政策，所有一切大小事宜都同西藏僧俗工作人员和人民进行协商，根据他们的意愿逐步予以实施。在这样对西藏谋福利从而取得信任的基础上，逐步消除了过去遗留下来的汉藏民族间的隔阂的旧影响，给我以极大的鼓舞，怀着极度愉快的心情，于去年前来祖国的首都北京，代表西藏僧俗人民出席了全国人民代表大会会议，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席为首的各首长。在全国人民代表大会会议上，享受民族平等的权利，参加讨论和制定宪法，选举了国家领导人员。在圆满地完成了这些工作后，到全国各大城市参观时，又受到各个地区的各界、各兄弟民族的真诚欢迎和招待，亲眼看到各兄弟民族团结一致地努力建设祖国的结果。短短的几年间，人民的政治、经济、文化生活等各方面得到很大的发展，轻工业、重工业以及其他建设事业上都获得了不能以言语形容的成就。同时各大小城市著名寺庙中有失修倒塌情况的，都由中央拨款加以缮修，所有男女教徒，无论信仰任何宗教，均受到法律保护，不予干涉，具体地实现了宪法中关于信教自由的规定。这些都是亲眼看到的事实。
    我们的祖国是一个土地广大，人口众多，物产丰富的国家。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，各民族平等团结空前巩固的基础上，共同一致地努力发展建设事业的结果，使祖国如青春的花木，日益走向繁荣富强的境地，因而使我们由衷地相信，我们的祖国一定能够胜利地走向社会主义社会。我们西藏人民以自己是祖国大家庭的一员而感到光荣和骄傲。我们相信西藏人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，在先进的汉民族的帮助下，一定能够建设起一个幸福美满的新西藏。
    这次我们在北京期间，根据毛主席的深邃指示，有关西藏内部的事务上，关于西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会统一成立自治区筹备委员会、西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会请求国务院帮助建设的事项、西藏地方政府同班禅堪布会议厅委员会双方协商解决了多年间未解决的悬案问题、西藏地方政府的纸币问题、改编藏军问题等，请求帮助的事项，可以在今天的会议上经过讨论，修正，做出决定，我们将愉快地拥护和遵照这些决定，加强各兄弟民族间，尤其是汉藏民族间，以及西藏人民内部的团结，圆满地进行建设西藏的工作。西藏人民将和全国各兄弟民族人民一道，尽一切力量为建设伟大的祖国，保卫世界和平，反对美帝国主义的侵略战争政策，解放我国的领土台湾而奋斗！
    关于西藏和平解放以来的详细事宜，已委托阿沛·阿旺晋美噶伦代表西藏地方政府向会议做报告，希望予以批评和指示。
