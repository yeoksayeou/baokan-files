Fully Utilize Scrap Metal in Construction

    Recently, many readers have written to suggest that relevant national economic departments should recycle and manage scrap metal, turning it into useful materials for economic construction. For example, some readers suggest establishing purchasing stations nationwide to collect scrap metal; others have made specific suggestions and raised questions regarding the scope and types of scrap metal to be recycled. These proactive suggestions not only demonstrate the people's attitude as masters of the country who cherish national wealth and care about national construction but also help the government understand the wastefulness of scrap metal resources and the neglect of management of scrap metal by some factories, mines, and enterprises.

    Currently, our country has paid attention to the recycling and management of scrap metal. The state established the Metal Recycling Administration in May last year and set up Metal Recycling Administration offices and transfer stations across the country according to regions and needs, specifically responsible for the recycling and management of scrap metal. The scope of scrap metal recycling and management is scrap iron and steel (including steel shavings and iron filings) and miscellaneous copper (including copper shavings), etc. All steel products, ironware, and copperware scattered throughout various places, such as steel plates used for mimeographing wax paper that have lost their value, copper coins, copper money, and other scrap copper, are all within the scope of recycling. Copper and iron bells, tripods, and Buddha statues, etc., scattered in temples, monasteries, or among the people, are also within the scope of recycling if they no longer have preservation value and are not within the scope of national cultural relic preservation and do not violate the national religious policy.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives across the country have accepted the business of purchasing entrusted by the state, directly purchasing scattered bits of copper and iron scraps and other scrap metal. Local supply and marketing cooperatives have also been purchasing scrap lead and tin, such as waste toothpaste tubes. Urban and rural residents, handicraft workers, etc., can sell the above-mentioned scrap metal to cooperatives and commercial departments, so that they can be concentrated and used for national construction.

    The scope of scrap metal is very broad. All metal waste, substandard products, and discarded waste materials generated during metal smelting, casting, rolling, forging, mechanical processing, and other production processes (including repairs) and capital construction, as well as metal equipment and metal products that have lost their original use value, are considered scrap metal. Scrap metal is an important national resource and one of the main raw materials for smelting enterprises. One ton of scrap steel can smelt about 0.8 tons of good steel. In 1954, the Metal Recycling Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry purchased more than 200,000 tons of scrap steel in various places, which could smelt about 170,000 tons of steel ingots. If calculated at 500 yuan per ton in new currency, it would be worth 85 million yuan in new currency. These steel ingots could be rolled into 116,100 tons of steel rails weighing 43 kilograms per meter, which could lay 1,350 kilometers of railway, exceeding the mileage from Beijing to Hankou. If these steel ingots were used to manufacture double-wheeled double-furrow plows, 2.33 million plows could be produced.

    Utilizing scrap metal has important economic significance. We know that any metal must go through complex production processes such as prospecting, mining, beneficiation, and smelting, while scrap metal can be directly recycled and smelted, and the production time is short and the cost is low. It can be seen that the rational and full utilization of scrap metal plays a significant role in promoting national industrial construction.

    把废金属充分利用在建设事业上
    近来，有不少读者来信建议国家有关经济部门对废金属进行回收和管理，使废金属变为对经济建设有用的物资。如，有的读者建议在全国范围内建立收购站进行废金属的收购工作；也有的读者在废金属的回收范围和种类上提出了一些具体建议和问题。这些积极性的建议不仅表现了人民群众爱护国家财富、关心国家建设事业的主人翁的态度，而且帮助政府了解了废金属的资源和某些厂矿企业单位不重视管理废金属的浪费行为。
    目前，我国已经重视了废金属的回收管理工作，国家在去年五月成立了金属回收管理局，并在全国范围内按地区和需要设立了金属回收管理局办事处和交接站，专门负责废金属的回收管理工作。废金属的回收管理范围是废钢铁（包括钢屑、铁屑）和杂铜（包括铜屑）等。所有散存在各地的钢制品、铁器、铜器，如失去使用价值的刻蜡纸用的钢板，铜元、铜钱和其他废杂铜等，都在回收范围以内。在庙宇、寺院或民间散存的铜铁钟鼎和佛像等，如果已经没有保存价值而不属国家文物保管范围以内、不违反国家宗教政策的，也在回收范围以内。
    全国各地供销合作社已接受国家委托收购的业务，直接收购散存在各地零星的残铜碎铁等废金属。对于废铅锡如废牙膏管子等各地供销合作社也已进行收购。各地城乡居民、手工业者等，都可以把上述废金属售给合作社和商业部门，以便集中起来用于国家的建设事业。
    废金属包括的范围是很广泛的。凡是金属冶炼、铸造、压延、锻制、机械工艺加工等生产（包括修理）和基本建设过程中所产生的金属废品、次品和残弃废料，以及失去原有使用价值的金属设备和金属制品，都算作废金属。废金属是国家的重要资源，是冶炼企业的主要原料之一。一吨废钢铁就能冶炼○·八吨左右的好钢铁。一九五四年重工业部金属回收管理局在各地收购的一部分废钢二十多万吨，约能冶炼钢锭十七万吨，如果用每吨以新币五百元计算，就值新币八千五百万元。这些钢锭可以轧制每公尺四十三公斤的钢轨十一万六千一百吨，可以铺设铁路一千三百五十公里，超过北京到汉口的里程。如果用这些钢锭制造双轮双铧犁，可以生产二百三十三万辆。
    利用废金属有着重要的经济意义。我们知道，任何金属都要经过探矿、采矿、选矿、冶炼等复杂的生产过程，而废金属可以直接回收冶炼，而且生产时间短、成本低。可见合理地充分利用废金属，对于促进国家的工业建设是具有重大作用的。  一展
