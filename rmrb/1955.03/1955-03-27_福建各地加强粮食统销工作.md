    Recently, relevant departments in Fujian Province jointly inspected the situation of grain unified purchase and marketing work. The grain departments are adjusting the unified sales quotas in some areas that are either too tight or too loose. After the fishing season arrived, Jinjiang Prefecture added grain supply points in the fishing areas. The grain departments also registered the grain needs of farmers who sold grain for turnover purposes during the unified purchase. In strengthening the work of unified grain purchase and marketing, the grain consumption habits of farmers are also taken into consideration. The grain departments recently transferred a large number of sweet potato dried slices from northeastern Fujian to Hui'an, Pingtan and other places. In response to the phenomenon of waste of grain in organs and schools in Jiangle County, a meeting was held to discuss the issue of grain conservation.

    福建各地加强粮食统销工作
    最近福建省各有关部门联合检查了粮食统销工作的情况。粮食部门正根据某些地区统销定量偏紧或偏松的情况进行调整。鱼汛旺季来后，晋江专区在渔区增设了粮食供应点。各地对在统购中因周转需要而卖出粮食的农民的需粮情况，也进行了登记。在加强粮食统销工作中，还照顾到农民的食粮习惯，粮食部门最近从闽东北一带调运大批地瓜干到惠安、平潭等地。将乐县针对机关、学校浪费粮食的现象，召开会议，座谈了粮食的节约问题。
