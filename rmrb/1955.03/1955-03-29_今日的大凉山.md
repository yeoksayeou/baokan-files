    Today's Greater Liangshan
  　Cheng Li
    It's not desolate here
    In a large area of land between the three provinces of Xikang, Sichuan, and Yunnan in southwest China, live more than one million Yi people. Among them, Greater Liangshan in Xikang Province is the largest Yi settlement in our country, with about 700,000 Yi compatriots. Although it is mostly high mountains here, there are many fertile river valleys between the mountains. Over the years, through the hard work of the Yi people, more than 1.2 million mu of arable land have been cultivated. In the high mountains surrounded by white clouds, a large amount of buckwheat and oats are planted. In areas with mild climates, two harvests can also be obtained. In the low-lying valleys, potatoes, corn, rice, and soybeans grow. Greater Liangshan is also rich in sweet tangerines, oranges, pears, peaches, apricots, and other fruits, as well as precious native and special products such as cordyceps, fritillaria, taro slices, wax insects, fox fur, and otter fur. Mineral deposits such as copper, iron, lead, silver, coal, and asbestos have also been discovered in many places. When we go to the countryside, Yi compatriots often send us mineral samples, hoping that we can send them to Beijing for exploration and mining. Before coming to Greater Liangshan, I thought it was a "desolate" and "bitterly cold" place; but after coming here, especially after working here for a few years, I increasingly felt the richness and beauty of Greater Liangshan.
      The New Zhaojue City
    Zhaojue City is located on the Zhaojue Plain in the central area of Greater Liangshan. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the reactionary rulers built a small city on the plain to suppress the Yi people. In the past, although it was called a "city," it was actually just a few dilapidated wooden houses. In October 1952, more than 300 representatives, representing the 700,000 people of Greater Liangshan, held a representative meeting in Zhaojue and established the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region People's Government. Since then, brand-new streets have appeared, and trade companies, banks, post and telecommunications bureaus, hospitals, cultural centers, and schools have been established one after another. The current Zhaojue City has become the political center of Greater Liangshan. The Autonomous Region has also cultivated a group of Yi cadres to enrich the autonomous organs. Now there are nearly a thousand Yi cadres in the region, working in various departments. The chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, the heads of the counties and deputy county heads, and the heads of the offices are all Yi people. Whether in government offices or in the countryside, we often see Yi cadres wearing felt cloaks and headscarves working diligently.
    Unity and Love Like a Family
    Since liberation, the unity between the Yi and Han nationalities and within the Yi nationality in the Greater Liangshan area has been increasing. Now, in many Yi villages, whether adults or children, when they see us, they greet us warmly from afar, making people feel like they are one family. Many Yi compatriots who could not meet each other in the past as "enemies" are now often meeting together to discuss the affairs of the Yi people. In some areas where Yi, Han, and various branches meet, the blockhouses built to defend against "enemies" in the past have now collapsed in some places, and the areas around the blockhouses have become places where shepherds freely graze cattle, sheep, and horses. Most of the land that was abandoned due to "fighting enemies" in the past has also been restored to cultivation. The Yi compatriots said to us: "In the old society, we needed guns to fight enemies; in the new society, we use hoes for production."
    In the past, due to the long-term implementation of national oppression policies by the reactionary rulers of the past dynasties, a deep divide was created between the Yi and Han nationalities in Greater Liangshan. Now, the Yi compatriots call the Han staff members sent by Chairman Mao "new Han people" who have come to help them. In some areas where the Yi and Han nationalities live together, many touching stories of unity and mutual assistance have also emerged. The Yi people of Sanhe Township, Tuomugou District, Puge County, had been hoping to build a canal for many years, but it had been blocked by rocks, and they did not understand the technology of excavating rocks, so they had not been able to start construction for a long time. After liberation, with the strong help of more than 100 Han farmers in nearby Taian Township, the Yi people of Sanhe Township quickly built the canal.
    New Post Roads and New Markets
    In 1952, there was only one post road in the Yi-populated area, from Xichang to Zhaojue. This post road was built during the Qing Dynasty, and the roadbed had long been incomplete after being eroded by rain. In 1951, after being rebuilt by the People's Government, this post road became passable for people and horses. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, it organized the Yi people and mobilized a large number of Han technical workers from the Han areas to work together to build roads. Now, more than 2,000 li of post roads have been built. People no longer have to worry about walking the narrow paths of rock climbing and vine gripping when going from Zhaojue to various counties. Last year, a road across the Greater Liangshan area—the post road from Zhaojue to Leibo, Sichuan—was also opened. Many of these post roads wind through high mountains more than 2,000 meters above sea level, and sometimes pass through fertile river valleys. Groups of Yi men and women are constantly traveling on the post roads. There was an old Yi woman in the deep mountains of Jinyang who married into her husband's family when she was young. Because of the dangerous mountains and cliffs, she had not returned to her parents' home once in more than fifty years. Last year, she happily returned to her parents' home for the first time on the newly built wide post road. With the post roads, the horses that the Yi compatriots used to raise only for occasional riding now also participate in transportation. Zhaojue and Butuo counties alone have organized transportation teams of more than 2,000 horses, increasing a large income for the Yi compatriots.
    Along the new post roads, many bustling markets have also appeared. In the past, there was no market in the Liangshan Yi-populated area. People had to travel to the Han area, a round trip of seven or eight days, to buy a catty of salt or a few feet of cloth. Butuo Dam is already deep in Liangshan. Since the post road was built here, this once overgrown place has gradually formed a bustling market. The state-owned trade company business department, bank, hospital, post and telecommunications bureau, and ethnic primary school have been established one after another. The trade company business department operates more than 400 kinds of commodities, and the daily turnover is about 10 million old currency. Hundreds of Yi compatriots come to the market every day, sometimes up to a thousand people.
    The Beginning of a New Life
    In the past, the most difficult thing for Yi farmers in production was the lack of iron farm tools. Some families used one iron farm tool together, and some used wooden farm tools. The land was not tilled deeply, and the weeds could not be weeded out. Even if the land was fertile, the yield was only 100 to 200 catties per mu. In order to help the Yi farmers develop production, the state transported more than 300,000 pieces of iron farm tools from the Han areas and distributed them to the Yi people free of charge. On average, each household in the region could receive two farm tools. Many farmers held the iron farm tools in their arms and jumped up happily after receiving them. Zhaojue farmer Bimu Ritu said excitedly when he received a plowshare: "I wanted to buy a plowshare when I was eighteen years old, but I couldn't do it until I was forty years old. My wish for more than twenty years has finally come true today." The People's Government also transferred a large amount of grain from the Han area and distributed it to the poor farmers free of charge. According to statistics before June last year, more than 1.84 million catties of relief grain have been distributed in the past few years. In addition, more than 2.4 billion yuan (old currency) of agricultural loans have been issued. With this assistance, the Yi farmers have actively engaged in production and restored most of the barren land to cultivation. Last year, due to the support of the People's Government and the focus on improving cultivation techniques, increasing the application of fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects, the grain output of the entire region increased by more than 460,000 catties compared with 1953. The People's Government has also established farms, agricultural technology guidance stations, and animal husbandry and veterinary work stations in Zhaojue, Puge, Xide, and Jinyang counties. Under the guidance and assistance of the farms, more than 600 Yi households changed from broadcasting to spot planting last year, and all of them achieved increased production. The yield per mu of many lands reached more than 300 catties. Crops such as rapeseed, radishes, and cabbage, which had never been planted or rarely planted in the Greater Liangshan area before, have also been planted more widely. Hundreds of labor models have also emerged in the region.
    Today, the lives of the Yi people in Greater Liangshan are improving day by day. Men can wear wide felt cloaks and wrap new, long headscarves. Girls can go out wearing large skirts embroidered with lace and holding beautiful parasols. Yi rice high-yield model Wa Qie Ahei said to me: "In the past, about eighty out of a hundred people here wore coarse linen pants or were bare-chested. Now everyone wears new clothes made of new cloth bought from the trade company, and people are more beautiful than before."

    今日的大凉山
  　程里
    这里并不荒凉
    在祖国西南的西康、四川、云南三省之间的一大片土地上，居住着一百多万彝族人民。其中西康省大凉山，是我国彝族最大的聚居区，约有七十万左右的彝胞。这里虽然多是高山，但在群山之间，却有许多肥沃的河谷平地。多少年来经过彝族人民的辛勤劳动，开垦出一百二十多万亩耕地。在白云萦绕的高山上，种植着大量的荞麦、燕麦。在气候温和地区，还可收获两次。低洼的谷地里，生长着马铃薯、玉米、水稻和大豆。大凉山还盛产甜美的柑、橘、梨、桃、杏等水果，和虫草、贝母、芋片、蜡虫、狐皮、獭皮等名贵的土、特产品。铜、铁、铅、银、煤和石棉等矿藏，也在很多地方发现。我们到乡村去，时常有彝胞送来矿石样品，希望我们把它送到北京，好来勘查开采。我在没有来到大凉山以前，曾认为大凉山是“荒凉”“苦寒”的地方；但来到大凉山，特别是在这里工作了几年，却越来越感到大凉山的富饶美丽。
      新的昭觉城
    昭觉城，在大凉山的中心区域昭觉平坝上。清朝末年，反动统治者为了镇压彝族人民，曾在坝上筑成一座小城。过去，这里虽然名为一个“城”，实际只有几间破烂的木板房。一九五二年十月，代表着大凉山七十万人的三百多个代表，在昭觉举行了代表会议，成立了凉山彝族自治区人民政府。从此，崭新的街道出现了，贸易公司、银行、邮电局、卫生院、文化馆、学校都纷纷成立了。现在的昭觉城，已经成为大凉山的政治中心。自治区还培养了一批彝族干部，充实了自治机关。现在全区约有近千名彝族干部，分别在各部门中工作。自治区人民政府主席、各县的正副县长和办事处的负责人都是彝族人。我们无论在机关或乡村里，都经常看到身着披毡，头裹长巾的彝族干部忙碌地工作。
    团结友爱如一家人
    解放以后，大凉山地区彝汉民族间和彝族内部的团结日益增强了。现在，在许多彝族村庄，不问大人或小孩，见到我们，远远就亲切地招呼着，使人感觉好像是一家人。许多彝胞在过去是不能见面的“仇人”，今天却经常在一起开会，讨论着彝族人民的事情。在一些彝族、汉族及各个支头交界的地方，从前为了防“冤家”、打“冤家”而建筑的碉堡，现在有的已经倒塌了，碉堡周围变成了牧童们自由放牧牛羊马群的地方。以往因“打冤家”荒芜的土地，也大部分恢复了耕种。彝胞们向我们说：“旧社会，要枪杆，打冤家；新社会，拿锄头，搞生产。”
    过去的大凉山，由于历代反动统治者长期实施民族压迫政策，造成彝、汉民族间很深的隔阂。现在，彝胞们称汉族工作人员是毛主席派来帮助他们的“新汉人”。在一些彝、汉民族杂居地区，还出现了许多团结互助的动人故事。普格县拖木沟区三合乡彝民，多年来盼望修通一条水渠，但因被岩石阻塞，又不懂开凿岩石的技术，长期未能动工；解放后，在附近泰安乡一百多个汉族农民的大力帮助下，三合乡彝民很快就把这条水渠修好了。
    新的驿道和新的市场
    一九五二年，彝族聚居区只有由西昌到昭觉的一条驿道。这条驿道，还是清朝时修筑的，经过雨水冲刷，路基早已残缺；一九五一年，经过人民政府重新修筑，才又有了这条人马可行的驿道。自治区人民政府成立后，一面组织彝族人民，一面从汉族地区动员来大批汉族技术工人，共同努力筑路，现在共修筑了两千多华里的驿道。人们从昭觉到各县去，不再提心吊胆走那扶岩攀藤的羊肠小道了。去年，一条横贯大凉山区的道路——昭觉到四川雷波的驿道也修通了。这些驿道，很多盘旋在拔海两千多公尺高的大山中，有时又穿过肥沃的河谷地带。成群的彝族男女，络绎不绝地往来在驿道上。金阳深山里曾有一个彝族老太婆，年轻的时候出嫁到婆家，因为险山悬岩阻隔，五十多岁了还没有回过娘家一次。去年，她才第一次踏着新修的宽阔的驿道欢欢喜喜回到了娘家。有了驿道，过去彝胞养的只供偶尔骑乘的马匹，现在也参加了运输，仅昭觉、布拖两县就已组织了两千多匹马的运输队，给彝胞增加了一大笔收入。
    在新的驿道旁，还出现了许多热闹的市场。从前，凉山彝族聚居区没有一个市场。人们为了买一斤盐或几尺布，都要跑到来回七八天路程的汉区才能买到。布拖坝，已是凉山深处了，自从驿道修到这里，这个过去荒草丛生的地方逐渐形成一个热闹的市场。国营贸易公司营业部、银行、卫生院、邮电局和民族小学都先后设立起来了。贸易公司营业部经营的商品共有四百多种，每天营业额都在旧币千万元左右。前来赶场的彝胞天天都有几百人，有时到一千人。
    新生活的开始
    过去彝族农民生产上最感困难的，就是缺乏铁质农具，有的几户人打伙用一件铁质农具，有的就使用木质农具，地耕不深，草不能薅，就是肥沃的土地，每亩也只有一、二百斤的收成。国家为了帮助彝族农民发展生产，从汉族地区运来了三十多万件铁质农具，无偿地发放给彝族人民。全区平均每户都能领到两件农具。许多农民领到了铁质农具后，抱在怀里高兴得跳跃起来。昭觉农民比目日吐领到一件铧口时，兴奋地说：“我十八岁时就想买一件铧口，到了四十岁，都没有办到。我二十多年来的愿望今天才实现了。”人民政府还从汉区调进了大批粮食，无偿地发给贫困的农民。据去年六月以前的统计，几年来已发救济粮一百八十四万多斤。另外还发放了农贷款二十四亿多元（旧币）。彝族农民得到这些帮助，都积极去从事生产，把大部分荒芜的土地恢复了耕种。去年全区由于人民政府的扶持和重点改进耕作技术，增施肥料，兴修水利，粮食产量比一九五三年增加了四十六万余斤。人民政府又在昭觉、普格、喜德、金阳四个县分别设立了农场、农业技术指导站和畜牧兽医工作站。在农场的指导和帮助下，去年就有六百多户彝民把撒播改为点播，全部获得了增产，不少土地每亩产量达三百多斤。以前大凉山区中从未种过或很少种植的油菜、萝卜、白菜等作物也比较普遍地种植了。全区还涌现了数百名劳动模范。
    如今，大凉山的彝族人民，生活正一天天地改善着。男子可以披上宽大的披毡，裹着新的长长的头巾。姑娘们出门去可以围着绣有花边的大裙子，打着美丽的阳伞。彝族水稻丰产模范瓦且阿嘿对我说：“过去我们这里一百个人中，差不多有八十人穿着粗麻布裤子或赤着上身，现在大家都穿上从贸易公司买来的新布衣服，人也比以前漂亮了。”
