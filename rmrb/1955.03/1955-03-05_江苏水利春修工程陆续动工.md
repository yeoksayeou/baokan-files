    Jiangsu's Spring Water Conservancy Projects Start Construction One After Another
    Jiangsu Province's spring water conservancy projects have successively commenced construction, with over 400,000 migrant workers having entered the work sites in various regions. After the migrant workers went onto the dikes, their morale was generally high. Members of the Shuanglong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangpu County, participating in dike repair, were able to carry five cubic meters of soil per person per day. Migrant workers from Jurong, Dantu, and other counties participating in the construction of river dikes were able to achieve "inch-by-inch tamping" when ramming, compacting the newly added soil firmly. Upon completion of these spring water conservancy projects, tens of millions of mu of farmland across the province will benefit. After the completion of the Sancang and Bengcha tidal barriers, over two million mu of farmland can be saved from the threat of saline-alkali flooding, and hundreds of thousands of mu of wasteland can also be reclaimed into fertile fields.

    江苏水利春修工程陆续动工
    江苏省水利春修工程已陆续开工，各地进入工地的民工已有四十多万。民工上堤后，情绪普遍很高，江浦县双龙农业生产合作社参加修堤的社员，每天一个人能挑五公方土。句容、丹徒等县参加修江堤的民工打硪时，都能做到“寸土寸夯”，把新加的土打得结结实实。这些春修水利工程完成后，全省可有数千万亩农田受益。三仓和栟茶两处挡潮闸完成后，可使二百多万亩农田免遭卤涝威胁，几十万亩荒草地也可以开垦为良田。
