A batch of various new types of agricultural machines and farm tools, which the Ministry of Agriculture planned to allocate to state-owned mechanical farms in Gansu Province in February and March this year, has mostly arrived in Lanzhou. These include: eleven tractors, five combine harvesters, four twenty-four row seeders, as well as connectors, disc harrows, spike-tooth harrows, and five-bottom plows. Some of these agricultural machines have been transported separately to the state-owned Wuwei and Huangyanghe mechanical farms, the state-owned Zhangye Laosi Temple mechanical farm, and the mechanical farms in the Yinchuan area, and will soon be put into spring plowing, sowing, and land reclamation work.

The state-owned mechanical farms in Gansu Province, with the exception of the Lingwu Farm in the Yinchuan area, are mostly newly built last year and this year. These farms all have large land reclamation tasks. The Huangyanghe Farm plans to reclaim more than 10,000 mu, and the land reclamation area of the Zhangye Laosi Temple Farm will also be nearly 10,000 mu. The timely arrival of this batch of new agricultural machinery will provide a strong guarantee for these farms to complete this year's land reclamation and production tasks.

    一批新机器运到甘肃各农场
    农业部计划在今年二、三月份调拨给甘肃省各国营机械农场的各种新型农业机器和农具，已大部运到兰州。计有：拖拉机十一台，联合收割机五台，二十四行播种机四台，还有连结器、圆盘耙、钉齿耙和五铧犁等。这些农业机器有的已分别运到国营武威、黄羊河机械农场、国营张掖老寺庙机械农场和银川专区的各机械农场，并即将投入春耕播种和开荒工作。
    甘肃省的各国营机械农场，除银川专区的灵武农场外，大都是去年和今年新建的。这些农场的开荒任务都很大。黄羊河农场计划要开荒一万多市亩，张掖老寺庙农场开荒面积也将近一万亩。这批新型农业机械的及时到达，对这些农场完成今年开荒任务和生产任务将提供有力的保证。            （本报驻兰州记者）
