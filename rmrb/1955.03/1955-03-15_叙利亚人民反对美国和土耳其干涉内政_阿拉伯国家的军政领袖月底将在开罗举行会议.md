Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 13th: TASS reports, according to the Syrian "Al-Manar" newspaper, a delegation of Damascus workers' unions visited the Speaker of the Syrian Parliament and the Prime Minister, and on behalf of all workers in Damascus, delivered a protest letter against the recent US note. The US note suggested that the Syrian government participate in the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty. The workers also protested against Turkish Prime Minister Menderes' public threats. Menderes made these threats in his recent statement regarding Syria's agreement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

The Damascus workers' protest letter stated: "The US government's note and the Turkish Prime Minister's statement grossly interfere in Syria's internal affairs and openly attempt to force us to participate in the aggressive treaties of Western imperialist countries. We, representing the Syrian working class, demand that Syrian government officials show a consistently firm attitude towards those who want to deprive us of our independence, and resolutely resist any imperialist pressure."

According to Damascus sources, student delegations from the University of Syria and various schools in Damascus also visited the Syrian Prime Minister, expressing strong protests against the US note and the Turkish Prime Minister's statement.

The Syrian "Al-Talbia" newspaper also protested against the crude pressure exerted on Syria by the United States and Turkey, and expressed its belief that all imperialist attempts aimed at dragging Syria into Western military blocs "will be bankrupt due to the resistance of the Syrian people."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 11th: TASS reports from Cairo on the 10th: According to newspapers, Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salah Salem, said that representatives of Arab countries will hold a meeting in Cairo between March 20th and 25th to discuss the establishment of a new organization for defense and economic cooperation between Arab countries. The meeting will be attended by prime ministers, foreign ministers, defense ministers, finance and economic ministers, and chiefs of staff of the armed forces of various Arab countries.

Salah Salem went on to say that Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have already sent invitations to the meeting to "those Arab countries that agree to establish the new organization." In response to a question, Salem said that Iraq could also participate in the meeting, but first it must refuse to enter into alliances with non-Arab countries.

According to "Al-Ahram" newspaper, based on the agreement reached by Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, the headquarters of the future Arab Joint Military Command will be located in Damascus.

    叙利亚人民反对美国和土耳其干涉内政
    阿拉伯国家的军政领袖月底将在开罗举行会议
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特十三日讯：据叙利亚“灯塔报”报道，大马士革工人联合代表团访问了叙利亚议会议长和总理，并且代表大马士革全体工人交给他们一份对不久以前的美国照会表示抗议的抗议书。美国的照会建议叙利亚政府参加土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。工人们还对土耳其总理曼德列斯的公开威胁表示抗议。曼德列斯在他不久以前为叙利亚同埃及和沙特阿拉伯签订协定而发表的声明中提出了这种威胁。
    大马士革工人的抗议书说：“美国政府的照会和土耳其总理的声明粗暴地干涉叙利亚的内政并且公开企图硬拉我们参加西方帝国主义国家的侵略性的条约。我们代表叙利亚的工人阶级，要求叙利亚的政府人士对那些想剥夺我们独立的人表示一贯的强硬态度，并且坚决地反抗任何帝国主义的压力。”
    据大马士革消息，叙利亚大学的学生和大马士革各学校学生代表团也访问了叙利亚总理，对美国的照会和土耳其总理的声明表示强烈的抗议。
    叙利亚“塔尔比亚报”也对美国和土耳其向叙利亚施加粗暴压力表示抗议，并且表示相信，一切以把叙利亚拖进西方国家军事集团的帝国主义为目的的企图，“都将由于叙利亚人民的反抗而遭到破产”。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社开罗十日讯：据报纸报道，埃及国家指导部长赛拉·萨勒姆说，阿拉伯国家的代表将在三月二十日到二十五日之间在开罗举行会议，讨论关于建立阿拉伯国家之间新的防务和经济合作的组织。参加会议的将有总理、外交部长、国防部长、财政经济部长和阿拉伯各国军队的总参谋长。
    赛拉·萨勒姆接着说，叙利亚、埃及和沙特阿拉伯三国已经把会议请帖发给“那些同意建立新组织的阿拉伯国家”。萨勒姆在回答问题时说，伊拉克也能参加会议，但首先它必须拒绝同非阿拉伯国家订立联盟。
    据“金字塔报”消息，根据埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯三国所取得的协议，未来的阿拉伯联合军事司令部的总部将设在大马士革。
