    Many Units in Beijing and Nanjing Actively Take Measures to Save Grain

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau invited food management personnel from 84 major factories, construction sites, hospitals, schools, and central, municipal, and district-level government offices on the 17th and 19th to hold separate symposiums to study and exchange methods and experiences in saving grain. At the symposiums, everyone used many facts to illustrate that as long as publicity and education on cherishing grain is strengthened for cadres, workers, and cooks ideologically, and necessary improvements are made in food management, grain waste can be completely eliminated. The Chinese People's University has more than 10,000 people eating at the school. Because they usually pay attention to the education of cooks, the food management system is sound, and they carry out activities such as saving grain every year, the phenomenon of wasting grain is rarely found. At the symposium, various units also exposed many phenomena of grain waste and put forward many improvement methods.

    In the past few days, the dining units of many government offices, factories, schools, and hospitals have checked the phenomenon of grain waste and have established systems and methods for saving grain. Peking University decided to save 200 kilograms of grain in April, and will formulate monthly grain saving targets and plans thereafter, and will regularly commend and criticize good and bad examples of grain saving and waste. The trade union of the Xinhua Printing Factory specially held an exhibition against wasting grain, and the cooks held a meeting to study and improve food management. The factory plans to save about 30,000 kilograms of grain throughout the year. The Xidan District People's Government re-investigated and fixed the number of people eating, and formulated a more accurate grain demand plan every month.

    The Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau is also comprehensively inspecting the grain storage work of more than 1,300 public and private processing plants and consignment shops in the city. Many districts have entered the key re-inspection stage. After inspection, most of the public and private processing plants and consignment shops have begun to strengthen business management and formulate specific grain storage systems. The Xidan District Grain Supply Station also stipulates that each consignment shop should check the grain temperature every three days and make records in order to understand the grain safety situation and strengthen storage. The supply station also conducts re-inspections. Many households have put forward guarantees to ensure grain safety through the summer. Forty-seven grassroots cooperative sales organizations in Chongwen District conducted mutual inspections in groups. Some cooperative consignment shops also collected and exhibited bad grain, educating everyone to cherish grain through facts.

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The organs, troops, factories, and schools in Nanjing responded to the call of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and paid attention to saving grain. The persons in charge of each unit personally checked the number of people in their units, verified the grain purchase plan, and led their subordinates to establish a system of cherishing and saving grain. Now, more than 280 units with more than 100 people in the city have checked the number of people, verified and revised the grain purchase plan, reducing the original rice purchase plan by 13% and the flour purchase plan by 25%. Various units also pay special attention to overcoming the phenomenon of grain waste. The cooks of some units have also come up with ways to improve cooking methods to make more rice.

    北京南京许多单位积极采取节约粮食措施
    据新华社讯：北京市粮食局在十七、十九两日邀请了八十四个较大工厂、工地、医院、学校和中央、市、区级机关的伙食管理人员，分别举行座谈会，研究、交流节约粮食的办法和经验。座谈会上，大家以许多事实说明，只要在思想上加强对干部、职工、炊事员爱惜粮食的宣传教育，并对伙食管理进行必要的改进，粮食浪费现象是完全可以杜绝的。中国人民大学有一万多人在学校吃饭，由于平常注意对炊事员的教育，伙食管理制度健全，每年开展节约粮食等运动，浪费粮食的现象很少发现。座谈会上，各单位还揭发了许多浪费粮食的现象，提出不少改进的办法。
    最近几天来，许多机关、工厂、学校、医院的膳食单位，检查了浪费粮食的现象，已订出节约粮食的制度和办法。北京大学决定在四月份节约粮食二百斤，以后按月订出节约粮食的指标和计划，并经常对节约和浪费粮食的好坏事例进行表扬和批评。新华印刷厂车间工会专门举办了一个反对浪费粮食的展览会，炊事员们并开会研究改进伙食管理，全厂计划全年节约粮食三万斤左右。西单区人民政府重新调查固定了吃饭人数，每月订出比较准确的需粮计划。
    北京市粮食局并正在全面检查全市一千三百多家公、私营加工厂、代销店的粮食保管工作。很多区已进入重点复查阶段。绝大部分公、私营加工厂、代销店经过检查，开始加强了经营管理，订出具体的粮食保管制度。西单区粮食供应站还规定各代销店三天检查一次粮温，作出记录，以便随时了解粮食安全情况，加强保管。供应站还进行复查。很多户提出了使粮食安全度夏的保证。崇文区四十七个基层合作社销货机构，分组互相展开了检查，有些合作社代销店还将坏粮收集起来进行展览，通过事实教育大家爱惜粮食。
    据新华社讯：南京市机关、部队、工厂和学校响应中国共产党南京市委员会的号召，都注意了节约粮食。各个单位的负责人都亲自核对本单位人数，核实购粮计划，并领导所属人员建立了爱惜和节约粮食的制度。现在，全市已有二百八十多个一百人以上的单位核对了人数，核实和修订了购粮计划，把原订购米计划减少百分之十三，购面粉计划减少百分之二十五。各个单位还特别注意克服浪费粮食的现象。有些单位的炊事员还想出改进煮饭的办法，使煮出的饭多一些。
