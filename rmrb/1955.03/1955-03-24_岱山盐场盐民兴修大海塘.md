Daishan Salt Field Salt Farmers Build Great Seawall
    The salt farmers of Daishan Salt Field in Zhoushan District, Zhejiang Province, are working hard to build the Daixi Great Seawall. Daishan Salt Field is a private salt field. When the salt farmers produce salt, they scrape the salty mud from the ground, use seawater to wash out the salt content in the mud, and then dry it into salt. However, because some of the salty mud fields are at higher elevations, they cannot store tidal water for salt production, resulting in very low salt yields. In order to change this situation, the state invested more than 47,000 yuan to help the salt farmers build a Daixi Great Seawall. This seawall is about nine li long and also has two large three-hole sluice gates and one medium-sized single-hole sluice gate, with the entire project requiring more than 95,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Construction began in early March and is expected to be completed by the end of March.

    After the completion of this seawall, 875 salt farming households, with over 7,000 mu of salt fields, will benefit, and the annual salt production can be increased by more than 110,000 dan. It can also protect more than 1,600 mu of paddy fields, more than 860 mu of dry land, and more than 900 mu of reed fields from drought threats. (Fu Xiashan)

岱山盐场盐民兴修大海塘
    浙江省舟山区岱山盐场盐民正紧张兴修岱西大海塘。岱山盐场是一个民营盐场。盐民生产时是把咸泥从地上刮起来，用海水把泥中盐份冲出再晒成盐。但因有一部分咸泥场地势较高，无法蓄存海潮晒盐，因此，盐产量很低。为了改变这种情况，国家投资了四万七千多元，帮助盐民修建一个岱西大海塘。这个海塘约有九里长，还有两座大型三孔碶闸，一座中型单孔碶闸，全部工程需要九万五千多土方。三月初开工，到三月底可完工。
    这个海塘修成后，受益的盐民有八百七十五户，盐田七千多亩，每年共可增产食盐十一万多担。还可以使水稻田一千六百多亩，旱田八百六十多亩和苇地九百多亩免除旱灾威胁。（傅霞山）
