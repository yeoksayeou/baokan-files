The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on the 10th to discuss agricultural issues.

Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, stated at the meeting that while the West German government is pursuing a policy of preparing for a new war, which is leading to a decline in the living standards of farmers, the German Democratic Republic is taking all possible measures to ensure further agricultural development and improve the material conditions of all working people in the republic.

Grotewohl emphasized that it is necessary to tap all agricultural potential to increase yields per unit area, livestock products, and feed production efficiency. He also emphasized the need to improve the work of agricultural management institutions.

Based on Grotewohl's motion, the Council of Ministers stipulated several specific measures to further develop agriculture. By utilizing all available resources in agriculture, the following tasks can be accomplished: to over-fulfill the planned production in 1955 by 45,000 tons of meat, 250,000 tons of milk, 50,000 tons of grain, and a large amount of vegetables and feed.

    格罗提渥着重指出，必须发掘农业的一切潜力来增加单位面积收获量，牲畜产品和饲料生产率。他还着重指出，必须改进农业管理机构的工作。
    部长会议根据格罗提渥的动议，规定了若干进一步发展农业的具体措施。利用农业中一切可以利用的资源就能完成下列规定的任务：在一九五五年超计划生产四万五千吨肉类、二十五万吨牛奶、五万吨谷物以及大量的蔬菜和饲料。
