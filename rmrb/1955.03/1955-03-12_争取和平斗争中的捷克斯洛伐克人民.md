The Czechoslovak People's Struggle for Peace

　　It was the spring of 1949, not long after the launch of the movement to defend peace in Wroclaw. Preparations were underway for the Paris Peace Conference. The reactionary French government attempted to undermine our efforts by refusing to issue entry visas to many of our representatives. Among them was the Chinese delegation led by Guo Moruo. However, the French reactionaries miscalculated. The Peace Conference was not only held in Paris, but those representatives who were denied entry by the French government also held a meeting simultaneously in our Prague. As a result, the huge delegation from liberated China came to Prague for the first time. After the delegation arrived at the station, they cheered "Glory to Klement Gottwald," and we cheered "Glory to Mao Zedong" in response. Although our languages were different, we understood each other like family from the very beginning. Later, during the Prague conference, news arrived that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had liberated Nanjing. At that moment, we cheered and embraced each other like brothers and sisters. What united us was the common path towards a common goal, the common struggle against a common enemy.

　　Today, there are still such forces and people in the world who are unwilling to accept the victory of the Chinese people, just as they are unwilling to accept the victory of the Czechoslovak people. They sit in their skyscrapers and comfortable villas in Florida, issuing shouts with the aim of avoiding hearing the sound of their world and their attempts to dominate the world gradually being shattered. These people have been judged by the historical process itself, but they still attempt to defy this judgment and try to delay their own demise with another war that would kill millions of people. In Asia, they are mobilizing Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Bao Dai, who have long been spurned by the people of all countries. They are attempting to revive the German Wehrmacht, which was beaten to a pulp by the Soviet army ten years ago, to oppose Czechoslovakia. Now they want to send those executioners who leveled the mining village of Lidice and massacred its residents to conquer the rebuilt village of Lidice. The murderers of Julius Fučík are being hired to prepare to kill Czechoslovak youths wearing the Fučík Medal. Imperialism, which cannot engage in creative construction itself, is attempting to use atomic bombs to destroy everything that the Czechoslovak people have achieved on the road to building a new life. They are trying to eliminate from the face of the earth the ancient Czech and Slovak cultures that have contributed so much beauty and truth to the world. However, 1955 is not 1938. The Munich Agreement must never be allowed to repeat itself. The new Hitlers cannot tear the Czechoslovak Republic to pieces and then swallow it whole. After February 1948, traitors who were rejected by the Czechoslovak people just like Chiang Kai-shek was rejected by the Chinese people, hide in West German radio stations. There, they shout for dollars that a new crusade will march on Czechoslovakia. More than five hundred years ago, the West also used their crusaders against the Czechs. At that time, the feudal world was frightened by the victory of the anti-feudal revolution of the Czech Hussites. Huss's ideas spread far beyond national borders to foreign countries. The crusaders did not succeed then, and if imperialism dares to commit crimes and launch a new world war, they will not succeed now. In Czechoslovakia, they will encounter strong, indestructible resistance.

　　American generals and millionaires, West German war criminals, venal French politicians, and British diplomats cannot create history. History is created by the people, and the people do not want war. In more and more countries, the people are beginning to realize their strength more and more deeply, realizing that they are invincible because of their unity.

　　After the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovak people experienced severe trials. Now the Czechoslovak people have firmly grasped their own destiny in their own hands and will never give up this power to manage their own affairs again. They have learned from the lessons of reality who their true friends are. The Communist Party led them to victory and freedom. The guarantee of this victory, both now and in the future, is forever the lasting alliance with the Soviet Union and the consolidated friendship with the People's Republic of China and other European and Asian people's democratic countries. The invincible guarantee of the peace camp lies here. Klement Gottwald once said that not all Germans are the same; the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the workers' and peasants' government, is the first democratic and peace-loving Germany; despite much persecution, the forces of peace are growing daily in West Germany. The Czechoslovak people deeply understand the profound meaning of these words of Klement Gottwald. The Czechoslovak people also fully understand that in this great struggle, millions of peace-loving people in capitalist countries are also advancing shoulder to shoulder with us.

　　The London and Paris agreements, which threaten world peace, have mobilized the Czechoslovak people. In the cities of the Czechoslovak Republic, mass rallies with tens of thousands of participants have been held. In the countryside, at countless gatherings held in unified agricultural cooperatives, factories, schools, and institutions, the working people of Czechoslovakia have expressed their dedication to the struggle against West German militarization and to defend the peaceful life of the peace-loving people of the world. Every working person in the Czechoslovak Republic is working harder. They are striving to expand and deepen their professional and general knowledge and improve their cultural level. The soldiers, who have inseparable friendly ties with the entire people, are constantly strengthening the defense capabilities of the Czechoslovak Republic. The staff of major factories and members of various unified agricultural cooperatives in the countryside write letters to workers and peasants in West Germany, France, and other capitalist countries, expressing their support for their struggles, explaining their determination to fight, and receiving their warm support.

　　The Czechoslovak people warmly welcome and support all measures taken by their government aimed at opposing the threat of a new war. The citizens of the Czechoslovak Republic attach great importance to the work of the Moscow Conference to ensure peace and security in Europe, and very satisfactorily approve the declaration issued by the conference. At the same time, they also welcome with particular excitement the words of Zhang Wentian, the representative of the People's Republic of China: The Chinese people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe. The struggle for peace in Asia and the struggle for peace in Europe are currently a unified, indivisible common struggle.

　　When Premier Viliam Široký spoke about the Czechoslovak government's program last November, he emphasized: "The revival of West German militarism and the establishment of an aggressive West German army will first threaten the borders of Czechoslovakia, the People's Republic of Poland, and the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the Czechoslovak government believes that once the Paris agreements are ratified, the governments of the aforementioned countries, in particular, must take effective joint measures to ensure their borders, because they have the same interests in the struggle against this danger." Preliminary measures have already been taken in this regard. The meeting of parliamentary representatives of the three countries held in Prague is a preliminary measure of great significance. Another significant measure is the announcement by the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Antonín Zápotocký, in February this year regarding the end of the state of war with Germany. The President emphasized that, given the comprehensive cooperation between the Czechoslovak Republic and the German Democratic Republic is developing, mutual understanding and friendship are increasing, our peoples are willing to cooperate peacefully with the whole of Germany. These words are in accordance with the facts. Czechoslovakia and West Germany have concluded new trade agreements and established the first cultural and sports contacts. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people, their party, and their government have in fact demonstrated their desire to establish normal peaceful relations with the whole of Germany. But at the same time, they are fully determined to crush any attempt to violate the inviolable territory and security of Czechoslovakia.

　　The aggressors are brutally interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. They also want to interfere in the internal affairs of Czechoslovakia in the same way. The Czechoslovak people, living on the western border of the peace camp, and the Chinese people, living on the eastern border of the peace camp, are equally determined to maintain peace and oppose all conspiracies and tricks. If the aggressors dare to launch a war, the Czechoslovak people will do their utmost to fight resolutely until final victory.

    争取和平斗争中的捷克斯洛伐克人民

    这还是一九四九年春天的事情，从保卫和平运动在弗罗茨拉夫发起后不久，就展开了召开巴黎和平大会的准备工作，反动的法国政府企图破坏我们的努力，拒绝发给我们许多代表入境签证。其中也有以郭沫若为首的中国代表团。但是法国反动派却是失算了。和平代表大会不仅在巴黎召开了，而且被法国政府拒绝入境的那些代表也在我们的布拉格同时举行了会议。结果，解放了的中国的庞大的代表团第一次来到了布拉格。代表团到达车站以后就欢呼光荣属于克里门特·哥特瓦尔德，我们也欢呼光荣属于毛泽东，作为答礼。我们的语言虽然不同，但是，一开始我们就像亲人一样彼此了解了。后来，在布拉格会议上接到了一个消息：中国人民解放军解放了南京。当时我们像兄弟姊妹一样同声欢呼和相互拥抱，使我们团结在一起的，是通向共同目标的共同道路，是反对共同敌人的共同斗争。
    今天在世界上还有这样一种势力和人们，他们不甘心中国人民得到胜利，正如不甘心捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利一样，他们坐在自己的摩天楼和佛洛利达的舒适的别墅里发出叫嚣，其目的是想避免听到他们的世界和他们统治世界的企图正在逐渐地遭到破灭。这些人已被历史进程本身所判决了，但是他们却还企图违抗这个判决，并企图以另一次使千百万人民死亡的战争来延缓自己的死亡。他们在亚洲动员起早已为各国人民所唾弃的蒋介石，李承晚和保大。他们企图复活十年前被苏联军队打得头破血流的德国国防军来反对捷克斯洛伐克。现在要把那些曾经夷平了利台斯矿工村和残杀了居民的刽子手们派去征服已重建起来的利台斯村。杀害尤利乌斯·伏契克的凶手正被雇佣来准备杀害胸前挂着伏契克奖章的捷克斯洛伐克青年男女。自己不能从事创造性的建设的帝国主义正企图用原子弹来毁灭捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设新生活的道路上所获得的一切，他们企图从地面上消灭曾贡献给世界那么多的美和真理的捷克和斯洛伐克的古代文化。但是，一九五五年已经不是一九三八年了，慕尼黑事件决不容许重演，新的希特勒分子已不能把捷克斯洛伐克共和国撕成碎片，然后又把它全部吞下去。一九四八年二月以后，像被中国人民所摒弃的蒋介石一样被捷克斯洛伐克人民所摒弃的卖国贼，隐藏在西德的广播电台。在那里，他们为了美元而喊叫着新的十字军将要向捷克斯洛伐克进军。而在五百多年以前，西方也曾用他们的十字军来反对捷克。当时，封建世界被捷克的胡斯教徒的反封建革命的胜利吓住了，胡斯的思想越过国界远远地传播到了国外。那时的十字军没有成功，如果帝国主义敢于犯罪和发动新的世界战争的话，他们现在也不会成功的。在捷克斯洛伐克，他们是会遇到坚强的、不可摧毁的抗拒的。
    美国的将军和百万富翁们、西德的战犯、卖身求荣的法国政客和英国的外交官们是不能创造历史的。历史是人民创造的，而人民并不希望战争。在越来越多的国家里，人民越来越深刻地开始认识到自己的力量，认识到他们之所以不可战胜，就在于他们的团结一致。
    在慕尼黑事件以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民曾经经历过严重的考验。现在捷克斯洛伐克人民已把自己的命运紧紧地掌握在自己的手里，并且再也不会放弃这种管理自己事务的权力了。他们已从事实的教训中认清楚谁是他们真正的朋友。共产党把他们引向了胜利和自由，这个胜利的保证，无论是现在和将来，永远是同苏联的持久的联盟，同中华人民共和国和其他欧亚人民民主国家的巩固友谊。和平阵营的不可战胜的保证就在这里。克里门特·哥特瓦尔德曾经说过，德国人并不完全都一样的；在工农政权领导下的德意志民主共和国，是第一个民主的和爱好和平的德国；尽管遭到许多迫害，和平力量在西德还是在逐日增长。捷克斯洛伐克人民对于克里门特·哥特瓦尔德这些话的深刻意义是十分理解的。捷克斯洛伐克人民也非常了解，在这个伟大的斗争中，同我们并肩携手前进的还有资本主义各国的千百万爱好和平的人民。
    伦敦和巴黎协定对于世界和平的威胁，动员了捷克斯洛伐克人民。在捷克斯洛伐克共和国的各个城市中，举行了有成千成万人参加的群众大会。在农村，统一农业合作社、工厂、学校和机关中举行的无数集会上，捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民都表示要致力于反对西德军国主义化，保卫世界爱好和平的人民的和平生活的斗争。捷克斯洛伐克共和国的每一个劳动人民都在更加努力地工作着。他们努力扩大和加深自己的专业知识和普通知识，提高自己的文化水平。同全体人民有着密不可分的友谊联系的军人们，正在不断地加强捷克斯洛伐克共和国的国防力量。各大工厂的工作人员，农村中各统一农业合作社的社员，给西德、法国和其他资本主义国家的工人和农民写信，表示支持他们的斗争，向他们说明自己的斗争决心，并且得到了他们的热烈拥护。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民热烈地欢迎和支持自己政府的旨在反对新战争威胁的一切措施。捷克斯洛伐克共和国的公民极端重视保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科会议的工作，并且非常满意地赞同会议所发表的宣言。同时也以特别兴奋的心情来欢迎中华人民共和国的代表张闻天所说的这段话：中国人民不仅关心亚洲和平，同样也关心欧洲和平。目前为亚洲和平而斗争和为欧洲和平而斗争，是统一的、不可分割的共同斗争。
    威廉·西罗基总理于去年十一月在谈到捷克斯洛伐克政府的政纲时强调指出：“复活西德军国主义和建立侵略性的西德军队，会首先威胁到捷克斯洛伐克、波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的边境，因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为：一旦巴黎协定批准，特别是上述国家政府，由于在反对这种危险的斗争中利害一致，就必须采取有效的共同措施来保障自己边境。”在这方面已采取了初步的措施，在布拉格举行的这三个国家的议会代表的会议，就是一个具有重大意义的初步的措施。其次一个有重大意义的措施是今年二月捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统安托宁·萨波托斯基关于结束对德战争状态的公告。总统强调指出，鉴于捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的全面合作正在发展，相互谅解和友谊正在增进，我国各族人民愿意同整个德国和平合作。这些话是符合事实的。捷克斯洛伐克和西德缔结了新的贸易协定，并且建立了首次的文化和体育联系。因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民，他们的党和政府，在事实上证明了他们力图同整个德国建立正常的和平的关系。但是同时，他们也有着充分的决心粉碎侵犯捷克斯洛伐克不可侵犯的领土和安全的任何企图。
    侵略者在台湾和澎湖列岛粗暴地干涉中华人民共和国的内政。他们也想这样干涉捷克斯洛伐克的内政。生活在和平阵营西方边境的捷克斯洛伐克人民和生活在和平阵营东方边境的中国人民一样，决心维护和平，反对各种阴谋诡计。如果侵略者胆敢发动战争，捷克斯洛伐克人民将竭尽全力，进行坚决斗争，直到最后胜利。
