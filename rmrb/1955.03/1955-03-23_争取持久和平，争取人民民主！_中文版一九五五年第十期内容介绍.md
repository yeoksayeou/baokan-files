    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 10, 1955, has been published.
    This issue contains the full text of the resolution on the political situation and the tasks of the party adopted by the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and publishes an editorial entitled "Adhere to the Leninist Principles of Socialist Construction." The editorial states that Lenin and his loyal successor Stalin taught us that heavy industry is the unshakable material foundation of socialism, and socialist industrialization is the main means of building socialism. The resolution adopted by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party clearly demonstrates that only by implementing the policy of socialist industrialization, only by ensuring the priority development of the production of the means of production, the continuous improvement of labor productivity, and the reduction of production costs, can we consolidate the material foundation of socialism and provide a solid foundation for continuously improving the living standards of the working people. The editorial also points out the importance of transforming agriculture according to socialist principles, ensuring the leading role of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance, and ensuring the leading and guiding role of the working-class party in socialist construction.
    Important articles published in this issue include: "The German People's Desire for Peace and Unity Must Be Realized!" by Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic; "Continuing to Develop the Agriculture of the Romanian People's Republic" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; and "Political and Organizational Issues in the Movement Against the Preparation of Atomic War" by Sereni, member of the Central Guidance Office of the Italian Communist Party.
    Grotewohl's article is a summary of the government statement he made at the session of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on March 2 this year. The article points out that after the Bonn Federal Parliament approved the Paris Agreements against the will of the German people, we once again publicly declare: after the ratification of the Paris Agreements, any negotiations will only be meaningful if the Paris Agreements are abolished.
    Gheorghiu-Dej's article discusses in detail Romania's tasks of increasing the yield per unit area of agriculture, increasing the total output of agricultural products, and increasing the output of commercial grain this year. The article states that increasing grain production is one of the most important tasks in developing agriculture. Agricultural laborers must ensure a bumper harvest of all crops, and the total output of wheat and corn should reach ten million tons.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”  中文版一九五五年第十期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第十期中文版已经出版。
    本期刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会最近一次全体会议所通过的关于政治形势和党的任务的决议全文，并且以“坚持社会主义建设的列宁主义原则”为题发表社论。社论说，列宁和他的事业的忠实继承者斯大林教导我们，重工业是社会主义的不可动摇的物质基础，社会主义工业化是建设社会主义的主要手段。匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议所通过的决议，极其清楚地表明，只有执行社会主义工业化政策，只有保证生产资料生产的优先发展、劳动生产率的不断提高和生产成本的降低，才能巩固社会主义的物质基础，才能为不断提高劳动人民的生活水平提供巩固的基础。社论还指出了按照社会主义方针来改造农业、保证工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导作用、保证工人阶级政党在社会主义建设中的领导和指导作用等的重要意义。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的“德国人民的和平和统一的愿望必须实现！”，罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员乔治乌—德治的“继续发展罗马尼亚人民共和国的农业”，意大利共产党中央指导处委员塞伦尼的“反对准备原子战争的运动中的政治和组织问题”等。
    格罗提渥的文章是他今年三月二日在德意志民主共和国人民议院会议上所作的政府声明的摘要。文章在指出波恩联邦议院违背德国人民意志批准巴黎协定以后说，我们再一次公开地宣布：巴黎协定批准以后，要想使任何谈判具有意义，就必须废除巴黎协定。
    乔治乌—德治的文章详细地谈到了罗马尼亚提高今年农业单位面积产量、增加农产品的总产量和商品粮食产量的任务。文章说，增加谷物产量是发展农业的一项最重要的任务。农业劳动者必须使一切作物都获得丰收，小麦和玉蜀黍的总产量要达到一千万吨。　　　　　（新华社）
