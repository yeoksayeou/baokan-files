    Autoclave Exposed to the Elements Editor:
    At the end of 1953, the Fushun Municipal Hospital bought an autoclave for two hundred million yuan (old currency). After the autoclave was transported back, it was placed next to the road in front of the hospital's Fifth Ward, exposed to the elements. Who wouldn't feel pained to see this situation? In July 1954, I criticized this through the Fushun Daily. The Municipal Hospital's response was: "There is no room, it cannot be installed..." It still has not been installed. We must ask: if there is no room for installation, why did they buy this autoclave!

    风化中的高压灭菌器编辑同志：
    一九五三年底，抚顺市立医院以两亿元（旧币）买进了一台高压灭菌器。这台高压灭菌器运回以后，就被放在医院第五病房门前的马路旁边，任凭风化雨蚀。谁能看到这种情况不痛心呢？一九五四年七月我曾通过抚顺日报提出批评。市立医院的答复是：“没有房子，不能安装……”直到现在也还没有安装。我们要问：既然没有房子安装，为什么他们要买这台灭菌器呢！            阮　萍
