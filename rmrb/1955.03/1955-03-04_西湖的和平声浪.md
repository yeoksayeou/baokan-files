    The Peaceful Voices of West Lake
    Lü Fan, Zheng Feng
    As of February 25th, 242,000 people living in Hangzhou's beautiful West Lake scenic area had signed the "Letter to the People of the World."
    From the Hangzhou Railway Station to the beautiful shores of West Lake, one could see a constant stream of people signing at the signature stations, day and night. They included tourists visiting West Lake from other places, as well as workers, suburban farmers, and mothers carrying infants. At the signature station at Hangzhou Railway Station, a middle-aged woman was signing with a child in tow. Her name was Wang Xiulan. Fifteen years ago, her husband was killed by Japanese airplanes in Ningbo. At that time, she was a young woman of twenty-two, married for less than a year. She gave birth to this child a month after her husband's death. Today, she and her son came to sign together. She said, "I am a mother, and he is an orphan without a father. We have suffered the torment of war. We do not want war." Signature stations were also set up in the West Lake scenic area. When the signature campaign began, the twelve women in the military dependents' group living in Yue Fei Temple held a meeting to discuss how to mobilize everyone to sign. The group leader, Guan Guoping, a woman in her fifties, actively promoted the reasons for signing. Under her leadership, all forty-seven residents of Qixia Ridge signed.
    In the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, the people living by West Lake further clarified the two paths for the use of atomic energy. In the Sino-Soviet Friendship Gallery by the lake, a large photograph of the Soviet Union's first atomic power station aroused the excitement of many viewers! Two young workers were overjoyed as they looked at it, reading the description below the photo word by word: "... generating electricity not by using the heat generated by coal and other fuels, but by using the atomic energy released when atomic nuclei split... letting the current flow from here to factories and collective farms." The two young men held hands and said, "At that time, we will be standing by the button, only needing to turn the button to develop barren mountains and excavate rivers...". But on another picture, the American atomic bomb blackmailers were conducting an atomic bomb air raid drill in Canada, and Eisenhower was screaming about atomic war with his mouth wide open.
    In the West Lake scenic area—Six Parks, Su Causeway, Gushan, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Lingyin Temple, etc.—people feel the preciousness of peace more acutely as they praise the beauty of West Lake. On Su Causeway, a young couple from Shanghai, Liu Jiuchang and Li Jiaying, who were taking a honeymoon trip to West Lake, had both studied at the Hangzhou Art College in the past and felt very close to every plant and tree by West Lake. They said, "If the American imperialists want to destroy the happiness of mankind, then we will not hesitate to pay any price to punish them."

    西湖的和平声浪
    旅凡  正峰
    居住在我国美丽风景区——杭州西湖的人们，到二月二十五日止，已有二十四万二千人在“告全世界人民书”上签名。
    从杭州车站到美丽的西子湖畔，白天、晚上都可看到川流不息的人群在签名站上签名。他们有的是从外地来西湖游览的客人，也有工人，郊区农民和抱着婴儿的母亲。在杭州车站签名站上，有个中年妇女，手拉一个孩子在签名。她叫王秀兰，十五年前丈夫在宁波被日本飞机炸死了，那时她还是一个二十二岁刚结婚不到一年的少妇，丈夫死后一个月就生下这个孩子，今天她和她的儿子一起来签名，她说：“我是母亲，他是没有爸爸的孤儿，我们受尽了战争的折磨，我们不要战争。”在西湖游览区也设有签名站。当签名运动一开始，住在鄂王庙的军属小组的十二个妇女，就开会讨论如何动员大家来签名。小组长关国平是个五十多岁的妇女，她积极向大家宣传为什么要签名，在她的带动下，栖霞岭四十七个居民全签了名。
    反对使用原子武器的签名运动中，住在西湖的人民进一步看清了使用原子能的两条道路。在湖滨中苏友好画廊里，苏联第一座原子能电力站的大照片引起多少观众的兴奋啊！两个青年工人越看越高兴，他们一个字、一个字地诵读着照片下边的说明：“……不用煤和其他燃料所产生的热能来发电，而是利用原子核分裂时所释放的原子能来发电……让电流从这里送到工厂和农庄。”两个小伙子手拉手地说：“那时候我们站在电钮边，只需要把电钮扭一扭就可以开发荒山、开凿河流，……。”可是在另一幅画片上，却是美国原子弹讹诈者正在加拿大境内举行原子弹空袭演习，艾森豪威尔张开大嘴在那里狂叫原子战争。
    在西湖的游览区里——六公园、苏堤、孤山、三潭印月、灵隐等，人们赞扬西湖的美丽时，就越感到和平的可贵。在苏堤上，有一对刚从上海来西湖旅行结婚的青年男女——刘久常和李家英，他们过去都在杭州艺术专科学校读过书，对西湖边上的一草一木都觉得非常亲切。他们说：“如果美帝国主义想来毁坏人类的幸福，那么我们将不惜付出一切代价来惩罚它。”
