    Jointly Strive to Defend Asian and World Peace
    --Celebrating the Victorious Convening of the Asian Countries Conference
    Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee
    The Asian Countries Conference is about to be convened in New Delhi, India. This is the result of the efforts of peace-loving social figures from various Asian countries. It marks a further development of the close friendship and unity among the people of Asian countries and has significant historical importance for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. I warmly congratulate the convening of this conference.
    The Chinese people have consistently loved peace. In the past, like other Asian nations, we suffered long-term plunder and trampling by imperialist aggressive forces. Today, the Chinese people, who have taken control of their own national destiny, have particularly close sympathy and understanding for the just demands and actions of the people of Asian countries to oppose colonialism and foreign interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries and to strive for a peaceful environment. We have always advocated striving to establish friendly and cooperative relations with all countries with different social and political systems on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and strict respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We do not invade others, and we resolutely oppose any acts of aggression; we do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and we resolutely oppose any acts of interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    However, the American imperialists and their followers, regardless of the wishes of the people of Asian countries and the changes that have taken place in Asia, are still trying to impose the shackles of colonialism on them. In order to achieve this sinister attempt, they even vainly attempt to use the conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians" to make the people of Asian countries continue to be ruled and enslaved by foreign colonialism. Therefore, we must solemnly point out that the destiny of Asians must be in the hands of Asians themselves; the destiny of each country can only be arranged and decided by the people of that country. However, we do not exclude and welcome the sincere friendship and cooperation of any country. If we threaten other countries under the guise of "defense," or carry out fraudulent activities under the name of "aid," it is precisely contrary to sincere friendly cooperation, and we must resolutely oppose it.
    We advocate peace and believe that cultural exchange, economic exchange, and technological assistance should be implemented as peaceful coexistence. We believe that if the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are adopted by Asian countries and other countries, this will reduce the danger of war, promote the relaxation of international tensions, and further increase the possibility of friendly cooperation among countries.
    In order to safeguard peace and ease tensions in Asia and the world, we must also resolutely oppose the evil activities of the American aggressive group's warmongers who attempt to carry out atomic warfare; enthusiastically support the Soviet Union's lofty decision and efforts to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes and to implement international cooperation. Because the former brings devastating disasters to mankind, while the latter promotes the development of human civilization and brings an ever-increasing happy life to mankind. The powerful mass signature movement against the use of atomic weapons that is taking place all over the world expresses this common understanding and determination of mankind. We firmly believe that the power of the 1.4 billion people of Asia is invincible. As long as the peace-loving people of all countries further unite closely and take on the great task of safeguarding peace, peace will surely be maintained and consolidated. Those who are destroyed will be the war instigators themselves. We, the Chinese people, are willing to unite with the peace-loving people of all Asian countries and work together unremittingly to safeguard peace and international security!
    I wish the Asian Countries Conference a complete success!

    为保卫亚洲及世界和平而共同努力
    ——庆贺亚洲国家会议胜利召开
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席  陈叔通
    亚洲国家会议即将在印度新德里召开。这是亚洲各国爱好和平的社会人士努力的结果，它标志着亚洲各国人民的亲密友谊和团结的进一步发展，对保障亚洲和世界和平具有重大的历史意义。我热烈地祝贺这个会议的召开。
    中国人民是一贯爱好和平的。过去，我们正如亚洲其他各民族一样，曾长期地遭遇到帝国主义侵略势力的横暴掠夺和蹂躏。今天，掌握了自己国家命运的中国人民，对亚洲各国人民反对殖民主义和外国干涉亚洲国家内政、争取和平环境的正义要求和行动，有着特别密切的同情和了解。我们一向主张在平等互利和严格尊重对方领土完整和主权的基础上，努力与一切社会政治制度不同的国家建立友好合作关系。我们不侵略别人，也坚决反对任何侵略行为；我们不干涉别国内政，也坚决反对任何干涉别国内政的行为。
    但是美国帝国主义及其追随者却不顾亚洲各国人民的愿望和亚洲所发生的变化，依然力图把殖民主义的枷锁强加在他们的头上。为了达到这一罪恶的企图，甚至妄想用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋诡计，使亚洲各国人民继续受外来的殖民主义的统治和奴役。因此，我们必须严正地指出：亚洲人的命运必须掌握在亚洲人自己手里；每一个国家的命运只能由那个国家自己的人民来安排和决定。但我们亦不排斥而且是欢迎任何国家的真诚友好和合作。如果以“防御”为借口来威胁其他国家；或以“援助”为名来进行欺诈等阴谋活动，恰恰是与真诚友好合作完全相违背的，我们必须坚决反对。
    我们主张和平，认为要以文化交流、经济交流和技术帮助，作为和平共处的实施。我们认为，如果和平共处的五项原则为亚洲各国及其他各国所采纳，这就可减少战争的危险，促使国际紧张局势的缓和，并进一步增进各国友好合作的可能性。
    为了保障和平，和缓和亚洲及世界紧张局势，我们还必须坚决反对美国侵略集团好战分子企图进行原子战争的罪恶活动；热烈拥护苏联把原子能用于和平目的并实行国际合作的崇高决定和努力。因为前者给人类带来毁灭性的浩劫，而后者是促进人类文明的发展，给人类带来日益增长的幸福生活。正在全世界各地进行的反对使用原子武器的强大的群众性的签名运动，就表达了人类这一共同的认识和决心。我们坚信，亚洲十四亿人民的力量是不可战胜的。只要各国爱好和平的人民进一步紧密团结，把保障和平的伟大任务担当起来，和平就一定能够得到保持和巩固。被毁灭者将是战争挑拨者自己。我们中国人民愿与亚洲各国爱好和平的人民，团结一致，共同为保障和平和国际安全而努力不懈！
    敬祝亚洲国家会议胜利成功！
