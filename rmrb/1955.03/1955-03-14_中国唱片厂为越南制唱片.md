    China Record Factory Makes Records for Vietnam

    Since the first quarter of this year, the Shanghai China Record Factory has made dozens of kinds of records and reproduced 12,000 records for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The record content includes original songs by Vietnamese musicians, Vietnamese folk songs and local operas. The original songs reflect the heroic battles of the Vietnamese People's Army and the labor enthusiasm of the Vietnamese working class; they praise the Lao Dong Party and President Ho Chi Minh, as well as the friendship between Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union. Local operas focus on expressing the Vietnamese people's hatred and satire of the Bảo Đại puppet regime. Beautiful folk songs express the Vietnamese people's healthy love, labor and life.

    The employees of the China Record Factory greeted and completed the record production task with great enthusiasm. The employees overcame technical difficulties in production, ensured the sound quality of the records, and the design and decoration were generous and beautiful.

    中国唱片厂为越南制唱片
    上海市中国唱片厂在今年第一季度开始以来，已为越南民主共和国灌制了数十种唱片，并复制了一万二千张唱片。
    唱片内容包括越南音乐工作者的创作歌曲、越南民歌和地方戏曲等。创作歌曲反映了越南人民军的英勇战斗和越南工人阶级的劳动热情；歌颂了劳动党和胡志明主席以及越南、中国、苏联的友好。地方戏曲里集中地表达了越南人民对保大傀儡政权的仇恨与讽刺。优美的民歌表现了越南人民健康的爱情、劳动和生活。
    中国唱片厂的职工以高度的热情迎接和完成了这批唱片制作任务。职工们克服了制作中的技术困难，保证了唱片的音质，同时在设计装璜方面也都大方美观。
