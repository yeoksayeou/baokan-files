Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 4th: Anhui Province's oil industry will increase the production of vegetable oil by three thousand tons for the country this year by improving the oil extraction rate. Twenty-three testing stations will be established in the main oil-bearing material producing areas in April to guide the improvement of the oil extraction rate using scientific methods. The instruments used by the testing stations have now been purchased, and the testing personnel are studying.
    At present, advanced oil pressing method promotion offices have been established in the province, special districts, and most counties. The training class organized by the Huai Bei soybean producing area’s advanced oil pressing method promotion office to teach Li Chuanjiang’s advanced oil pressing method has ended. In March, a training class for technicians will be held in the rape seed producing areas of Wuhu and Anqing special districts to promote the advanced experience of rape seed mixed with rice bran oil pressing in this province.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 4th: This year, oil pressing factories and oil pressing workshops in Gansu Province will vigorously promote Li Chuanjiang's and other advanced oil pressing experiences, increasing edible oil production by 950 tons.
    After promoting Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing method, Lanzhou Xinlan Oil Pressing Factory produced three and a half to four more catties of oil per hundred catties of rape seed than in the past. Recently, Gansu Province held a provincial oil conference. The representatives who attended the meeting visited Lanzhou Xinlan Oil Pressing Factory and were greatly inspired.
    Gansu Province is rich in oilseeds such as rape seed, flax seed, and brown mustard seed. However, in the past, due to the backward production methods of various oil pressing factories and oil pressing workshops, the oil extraction rate was not high. According to recent preliminary statistics, if the four machine oil pressing factories and more than 7,000 oil pressing workshops in the province can improve their operation methods and promote advanced experience, increasing the oil extraction rate by 1% to 2% on the existing basis, the province's task of increasing edible oil production this year can be overfulfilled.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 4th: The employees of the joint state-private Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory No. 2, in response to the friendly challenge of increasing the oil extraction rate proposed by the workers of Li Chuanjiang's workshop, will increase the production of vegetable oil by more than 1,307,000 catties this year. This production increase target has been set down in the challenge letter. The main methods to increase production are to improve the oil yield of oil materials, reduce the residual oil rate in cakes, and reduce refining consumption and factory raw material consumption. The employees also proposed seven guarantees in the challenge letter, including conscientiously studying the advanced oil pressing experience of Li Chuanjiang and other oil factories, exchanging technology with each other, and strengthening the maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment.
    Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory No. 2 is the factory with the largest task of increasing oil production among the oil factories in Shanghai this year. In the first two months of this year, the employees studied Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing method, improved operations, and strengthened the connection between various types of work, and the oil extraction rate gradually increased. In January, each hundred catties of rice bran produced about twelve catties and two taels of oil, and in February it increased to thirteen catties and four taels. The oil yield per hundred catties of cold-pressed soybeans also increased by more than half a catty in February compared to January. A total of more than 76,000 catties of oil were produced in these two months.

    安徽、甘肃、上海等省市
    今年计划增产九百多万斤植物油
    【新华社合肥四日电】安徽省的油脂工业今年将用提高出油率的方法为国家增产三千吨植物油。四月份将在各主要产油料地区建立二十三个化验站，用科学的方法指导提高出油率。现在化验站用的仪器已经买妥，化验人员正在学习。
    现在省、专区和大部分县都建立了推广先进榨油法办公室。推广先进榨油法办公室在淮北大豆产区组织的传授李川江先进榨油法的训练班已经结束。三月份将在菜籽产区的芜湖、安庆专区举办技术人员训练班，推广本省的菜籽搀稻糠榨油的先进经验。
    【新华社兰州四日电】今年，甘肃省各榨油厂和榨油作坊将大力推广李川江等先进榨油经验，增产食油九百五十吨。
    兰州新兰榨油厂推广了李川江的先进榨油法后，每百斤菜籽比过去多出三斤半到四斤油。最近，甘肃省召开了全省油脂会议，到会的代表们参观了兰州新兰榨油厂，得到很大启发。
    甘肃省各地盛产菜籽、胡麻籽、芸芥籽等油籽。但过去因各榨油厂和榨油作坊生产方法落后，出油率都不高。据最近初步统计：全省四个机器榨油厂和七千多个榨油作坊，如能改进操作方法，推广先进经验，在现有基础上把出油率提高百分之一到百分之二，全省今年增产食油的任务就可超额完成。
    【新华社上海四日电】公私合营上海油脂二厂的职工，响应李川江车间工人提出的提高产油率的友谊挑战，今年将增产一百三十万七千多斤植物油。这个增产目标，已订定在应战书上。增产的主要方法是提高油料产油率，降低饼中残油率，减少炼耗和工场原料消耗。职工们还在应战书上提出要认真学习李川江和其他油脂厂的先进榨油经验，互相交流技术，加强机器设备的保养和检修工作等七项保证。
    上海油脂二厂是今年上海各油脂厂中增产油脂任务最大的一个厂，在今年头两个月中，职工们学习李川江先进榨油法，改进了操作，并加强了各工种间的联系，产油率逐步提高。一月份每百斤米糠产油十二斤二两左右，二月份提高到十三斤四两。每百斤冷榨大豆的出油量，二月份比一月份也多出了半斤多。这两个月共计增产油脂七万六千多斤。
