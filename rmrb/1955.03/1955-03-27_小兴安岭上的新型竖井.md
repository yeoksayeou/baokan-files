    New Type of Vertical Shaft in the Lesser Khingan Mountains
    Yuan Guilin

    I

    Hegang, nestled deep within the Lesser Khingan Mountains of Northeast China, is a scenic coal mining city. Surrounding it are continuous hills covered in dense forests, while the clear waters of the Heli River irrigate the fertile land on its banks. The Wutong River, famous for its fish production in Northeast China, quietly flows by its side. Twelve kilometers southwest of this beautiful city, the modern "Underground Coal City"—the Xing'antai Vertical Shaft—is under intensive construction.

    In the spring of 1952, the design blueprints for this "Underground Coal City" arrived from Moscow. The scale of the vertical shaft is substantial: the excavation of stone for underground roadways and chambers alone amounts to 180,000 cubic meters, and the reinforced concrete arch lining for the roadways and chambers totals over 18,000 cubic meters.

    On August 1, 1952, the people building the vertical shaft broke ground here with the historically significant first shovelful of soil. Since then, with the close guidance and enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, all employees have been working day and night to construct this great socialist project. After thirty months of hard work, the large and small roadways now crisscross like streets in a city. Underground facilities such as the fireproof train depot, coal bunker, and water reservoir have also been completed one after another. The above-ground construction of the industrial square, the over 5,000 square meter administrative and welfare complex, the huge winch room, the magnificent mechanical repair shop, and over a dozen important factory buildings and warehouses, such as the grease warehouse, have also been basically completed. The structurally complex railway coal bunker and railway gangue bunker are continuing winter construction and will be completed by the second quarter. A large winch with over 1,000 horsepower will be installed in the winch room, and various types of new Soviet machines will also be installed in the mechanical repair shop.

    The entire production process of the vertical shaft is highly mechanized and automated. Workers descend into the mine like taking an elevator in a safe cage, arriving at the bottom of the shaft, 188 meters deep, and then take an underground electric locomotive directly to their workplaces and work stations. The workers' tools are no longer shovels and picks, but the world's best coal mining machinery—combined coal mining machines from the Soviet Union. The safety and welfare facilities of the vertical shaft are also very complete. In addition to various explosion-proof equipment and ventilation devices, there are also underground fireproof train depots, fireproof doors, waterproof doors, and a large water reservoir that can hold thousands of tons of water. To prevent coal dust from flying, there are also water spraying devices on each mining face. In addition, there is also a health care canteen and medical clinic underground. Workers can receive medical treatment immediately if they become ill or have an accident during working hours. After the workers come up from the mine, they can first go to the bathhouse in the joint welfare building to take a bath, then go to the locker room to change into clean clothes, go to the sun lamp room to get sun lamp treatment, and finally go to the health care room to receive nutritious health products. The facilities for cultural and recreational activities are also very good.

    But this future happiness is created by the immense courage and hard work of all the employees building the vertical shaft. The Xing'antai Vertical Shaft is located in a highly water-bearing stratum. During the excavation of the shaft, the water flowing from the shaft wall was like a heavy rain, with a flow rate of over 100 cubic meters per hour. The workers wore raincoats and rain hats, working like divers. Every time the workers looked up or raised their hands, the icy water would flow from their faces and necks to their bodies and into their sleeves. During the shaft lining work, the marking lines were constantly jumping under the impact of the water, and the large amount of water washed over the entire bodies of each lining worker. Their hands were pale and numb from the water, but they still paid special attention to quality, accurately laying each of the several-kilogram cement bricks along the marking lines. At the beginning, they had no experience, and the mixed concrete for the arch lining transported from above lost its due strength because the slurry was washed away by the large amount of water. At the same time, the transport and unloading were also very inconvenient, and it had to be scooped out of the can in the shaft one shovel at a time. Later, with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Bogomolov, they developed a concrete slurry transport bag made of canvas, which not only prevented the concrete from losing slurry but also made loading and transportation more convenient. The hundreds of meters deep shaft was built in a struggle against the flood.

    Last September, a water inrush accident suddenly occurred in the Shimen main roadway project. Water gushed out of a large black hole as tall as a person, like a mountain torrent, and the entire roadway soon turned into a river. Soviet expert Bogomolov rushed to the scene immediately after hearing about the water inrush accident, inspected the water situation, helped engineers design waterproof walls, and guided workers to rush to install water pumps. The workers, regardless of how deep or cold the water was, rushed from all directions to rescue the situation. Some installed water pumps, and some built waterproof walls. The water became more and more fierce. When the third water pump was about to be installed, the second temporary waterproof wall collapsed, and the substation was about to be flooded. The workers quickly rushed to block the gap. Although they were already very tired, they carried bags of yellow soil and large pieces of wood towards the gap. Some people were numb all over after coming out of the mine. After resting, they still went down the mine as usual to fight the flood in the next shift. In three days and four nights, eight water pumps were installed, and six waterproof walls were built to overcome the flood and ensure the safety of the mine.

    The winters in Hegang are particularly cold, truly freezing everything. The northwest wind blows on the face like a knife. The people building the vertical shaft are carrying out winter construction. After more than three months of intense work, more than a dozen projects, including the machine repair shop, coal sample room, grease warehouse, and the over 5,000 square meter administrative and welfare complex, have been basically completed.

    In winter construction, even a stone, a bucket of water, a load of sand, and a bag of cement must be heated and insulated. Pouring concrete alone requires several more procedures than in summer construction. Although there are many difficulties, people have never forgotten the saying "A century-long plan, quality first" for a moment. The bricklaying team leader of the mechanical repair shop, Communist Party member Wang Mengfei, often said to all the workers in the team: "If we find that the bricks we laid are crooked in the summer, we can still correct them. In the winter, once a brick is laid, it is laid. We must pay special attention to quality." He not only laid the bricks neatly himself but also took care of the bricklaying quality of the entire team, personally checking it once after each layer was laid. They also implemented the "double-sided layering method," hanging lines on both the inner and outer walls, and cleaning the soil and frost from each brick before laying it. When encountering difficult places to lay, they would take off their gloves and operate with bare hands.

    During winter construction, Soviet expert Comrade Bogomolov always came to the site to inspect and guide, regardless of whether it was windy or snowing. When pouring the concrete foundation for the railway gangue bunker and laying the first platform, he personally checked the placement of each reinforcing bar and each template, immediately teaching the workers to correct any unsuitable places he found. Once, he saw that the workers were not tamping properly and personally taught the workers how to tamp. Thanks to the guidance of the experts, the project quality could be basically guaranteed even without winter construction experience.

    Not long after construction began in 1952, the shaft encountered a "quicksand layer" just a dozen meters down. If it were before liberation, the construction of this vertical shaft would have been abandoned because the "quicksand layer" was a fatal difficulty for building a vertical shaft. However, thanks to the use of the advanced Soviet method of "large well casing small well," the difficulty of the "quicksand layer" was safely overcome, and the annual shaft construction task was completed one and a half months ahead of schedule, saving wealth equivalent to three thousand tons of grain. Last September, when the Shimen main roadway had a water inrush accident, no national wealth or workers' lives were lost because the expert's suggestion of "digging a water reservoir first" was implemented in advance. In the second quarter of last year alone, Soviet experts made a total of thirteen safety-related suggestions. Significant results were achieved after their implementation, such as changing the main shaft for air intake and the auxiliary shaft for air exhaust to the auxiliary shaft for air intake and the main shaft for air exhaust, which not only made the underground air volume sufficient but also solved the difficulty of not being able to exhaust smoke after blasting.

    Workers and engineering technicians often use these words to express their gratitude and trust to the experts: "With the help of Soviet experts, we can overcome any difficulty!"

    小兴安岭上的新型竖井
    袁桂林
    一
    在祖国东北小兴安岭深处的鹤岗，是一座风景幽美的煤矿城市。周围连绵不断的大小山岭上丛生着茂密的林木，清澈的鹤立河水滋润着两岸肥沃的土地，以鱼产驰名东北的梧桐河，静静地从它身旁流过。在这座美丽城市西南十二公里的地方，一座现代化的“地下煤城”——兴安台竖井正在加紧建设。
    一九五二年春天，从莫斯科送来了这座“地下煤城”的设计蓝图。竖井的规模很大：只井下巷道、洞室开凿的石方工程，就有十八万立方公尺，巷道洞室钢筋混凝土的发碹工程就有一万八千多立方公尺。
    一九五二年八月一日，建设竖井的人们在这里挖开了有历史意义的第一锹土，从此全体职工在苏联专家亲切指导和热情帮助下，夜以继日地建设着这项伟大的社会主义工程。经过三十个月的辛勤劳动，现在大小巷道已像城市里的街道一样四通八达了。井下的防火列车库、煤仓以及水仓……等洞室也已先后完工。井上工业广场的建筑工程、五千多平方公尺的行政联合福利大楼、巨大的绞车房、雄伟的机械修理厂以及油脂仓库等十几个重要的厂房、仓库，也已基本建成。结构复杂的铁路煤仓和铁路矸石仓正在继续进行冬季施工，到第二季就可以建成。在绞车房里将安装一千多马力的大绞车，机械修理厂里也要安装各式各样的苏联的新式机器。
    竖井的全部生产过程都是高度的机械化和自动化的。工人下井生产像坐电梯一样坐上安全的罐笼，到达一百八十八公尺深的井底后，再坐上井下电机车，直接到达自己的工作场所和工作岗位。工人们的工具再不是铁锹和洋镐，而是世界上最好的采煤机械——来自苏联的联合采煤机。竖井的安全福利设备也十分完善，井下除有各种防爆设备和通风装置以外，还有井下防火列车库、防火门、防水门以及可以容纳数千吨水的大水仓。为了不使煤尘飞扬，在各个采煤工作面还有喷水装置。此外井下还设有保健食堂和医疗所。工人们在工作时间发生疾病和事故，可以马上得到医疗。工人们上井以后可以先到联合福利大楼的浴池去洗澡，然后到更衣室换上干净的衣服，到太阳灯室去照太阳灯，最后到保健室去领取富有营养的保健品。在文化娱乐方面的设备也很好。
    二
    但是这未来的幸福是全体建设竖井的职工用无比的勇敢、辛勤的劳动创造的。兴安台竖井是处在含水量很大的地层里。在开凿井筒时，从井壁流下来的水像大暴雨似的，每小时涌水量一百多立方公尺，工人们穿着雨衣，带着雨帽，像潜水员一样工作着。工人们一抬头、一举手，冰冷的水，就从脸上、脖子上流到身上，流到袖子里。在进行井筒砌壁工作的时候，标线被水击打得不停地跳动着，大水冲洗着每个砌壁工人的全身。他们的手被水泡得发白了，麻木了，但是还特别注意质量，按着标线把十几斤重的水泥砖，一块挨一块地准确地往上砌。开始时，他们没有经验，从井上运来的、拌好的、发碹用的混凝土，因为水太大，灰浆被水冲跑了，因而失去了混凝土应有的强度，同时运送装卸也很不方便，到井下得一锹锹的从罐筒里往下掇。后来在苏联专家鲍格莫洛夫同志的帮助下，他们研究出一种用帆布做的混凝土浆运送袋，不仅使混凝土不再跑浆了，而且装运也方便了。数百多公尺深的井筒就是在跟洪水作斗争建设起来的。
    去年九月，石门大巷工程突然发生出水事故，水像山洪暴发一样，从一人来高的大黑洞里喷射出来，不一会全巷道变成了河。苏联专家鲍格莫洛夫听到出水事故的消息，马上赶到现场，检查了出水情况，帮助工程师设计防水墙，指导工人突击安装水泵。工人们不顾水多深、多凉，从各方赶来抢险。有的安装水泵，有的打防水墙。水势越来越凶，当快安装完第三台水泵的时候，第二道临时防水墙被冲溃了，变电所眼看就要被淹，工人们又赶快前去堵缺口。他们虽然已经很累，但还扛着黄土袋子、抬着大木头，朝着缺口跑。有的人上井以后全身都麻木了，休息过来以后，下一班还照常下井和洪水斗争。在三天四夜里，安装了八台水泵，筑了六道防水墙，才战胜了洪水，保证了矿井的安全。
    三
    鹤岗的冬天特别冷，真是滴水成冰，西北风吹在脸上像刀刮一样。建设竖井的人们进行冬季施工。经过三个多月的紧张劳动，机修厂、煤样室、油脂仓库以及五千多平方公尺的行政联合福利大楼等十几件工程都已基本完工。
    在冬季施工，连一块石头、一桶水、一担沙子、一袋水泥，都要经过加热和保温。仅仅是浇灌混凝土就比夏天施工多了好几道工序。虽然困难很多，但人们一时一刻也没忘记“百年大计、质量第一”这句话。建筑机械修理厂的砌砖小组长、共产党员王梦飞，常常对全组工人说：“夏天发现砌过去的砖歪了，还可以修正，冬天放上一块是一块，咱们可得特别注意质量。”他不仅自己把砖砌的整整齐齐，而且还照顾全组的砌砖质量，每砌完一层他就亲自检查一遍。他们又实行了“双面层层挂线法”，里、外墙都挂线，并在砌砖之前把每块砖上的泥土和霜雪都打扫干净。遇到不好砌的地方，就把手套摘下来，光着手操作。
    在冬季施工中，苏联专家鲍格莫洛夫同志不管刮风，下雪，总是经常来到现场检查和指导。在浇灌铁路矸石仓混凝土基础和打第一节平台时，他亲自检查每一根钢筋、每一块模板的摆放，发现不合适的地方就马上教给工人改正过来。有一次，他看见工人捣固的不得法，就亲自教给工人怎样捣。由于有专家的指导，虽然没有冬季施工的经验，也能基本上保证了工程质量。
    一九五二年开工不久，井筒才开凿十几公尺就遇到了“流沙层”，若是在解放前，就会放弃这个竖井的建设的，因为“流沙层”是建设竖井的致命困难。但是，由于运用了苏联先进的“大井套小井”的方法，安全地克服了“流沙层”的困难，并提前一个半月完成了全年的井筒建设任务，节约了相当于三千吨粮食的财富。去年九月石门大巷发生出水事故，由于事先执行了专家提的“先掘水仓”的建议，所以国家财富、工人生命都没受到损失。只去年第二季，苏联专家共提出了十三项有关安全方面的建议。执行后收到很大效果，如把主井入风、副井排风改为副井入风、主井排风，不仅使井下风量够用了，而且又解决了放炮后炮烟不能排出的困难。
    工人和工程技术人员常常用这样的话来表达他们对专家的感激和信赖：“有了苏联专家的帮助，我们就能克服任何困难！”
