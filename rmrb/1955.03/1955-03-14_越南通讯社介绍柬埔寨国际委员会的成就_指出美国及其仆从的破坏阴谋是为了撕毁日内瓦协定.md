    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 13th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 12th: Contrary to the vicious arguments of the U.S. imperialists and the pro-American elements of the Cambodian authorities demanding the "dissolution" of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Cambodia, informed sources there pointed out that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Cambodia, since its establishment on August 11, 1954, has greatly helped to establish peace in the country.
    The International Commission provided many constructive opinions on resolving issues such as on-the-spot demobilization, exchange of prisoners of war and detained civilians, enabling all Cambodian citizens to participate in national life, and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia. These opinions were even more important due to the differences in views between the delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia and the representatives of the Khmer resistance forces and the Vietnamese volunteer personnel in Cambodia. From August 27 to October 19, 1954, the Cambodian International Supervisory and Control Commission held seven meetings with the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission to discuss common issues.
    After the dissolution of the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission, the International Commission continued to help the Royal Government of Cambodia to resolve issues such as enabling all Cambodian citizens to participate in national life and restoring the freedom of 300,000 detained civilians during the war.
    At a meeting held in Chai Zhen on October 20, Colonel Lon Nol, the chief representative of the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Royal Cambodian Army, speaking on behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia, thanked the Cambodian International Supervisory and Control Commission for its great assistance to both parties in implementing the armistice agreement. In addition, at a meeting held in December 1954 between the Cambodian International Supervisory and Control Commission and the Royal Government of Cambodia, Cambodian Prime Minister Phonn Yoth acknowledged that the International Commission came to Cambodia with the aim of helping the country, and said that the Royal Government of Cambodia had no other intention than to cooperate with the Cambodian International Supervisory and Control Commission.
    The above facts are sufficient to prove that the Cambodian International Supervisory and Control Commission has worked hard to effectively carry out the tasks entrusted to it by the Geneva Conference. At present, there are still many important issues to be resolved in the implementation of the Cambodian armistice agreement. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the International Supervisory and Control Commission must continue to perform its important tasks for a long period of time.
    The U.S. imperialists and their servants have slandered the Cambodian International Commission as being incompetent and clamored that it has completed its tasks in order to dissolve the International Supervisory and Control Commission, which exposes their conspiracy to drive the International Commission out of Cambodia. They do this in order to easily undermine universal suffrage, destroy the Geneva Accords and the newly restored peace in Cambodia, and drag the country into a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc.

    越南通讯社介绍柬埔寨国际委员会的成就
    指出美国及其仆从的破坏阴谋是为了撕毁日内瓦协定
    【新华社河内十三日电】越南通讯社十二日报道：同美帝国主义者和柬埔寨当局的亲美分子要求
  “解散”柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会的恶毒论调相反，那里的消息灵通人士指出，柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会从一九五四年八月十一日成立以来，大大地帮助了建立这个国家的和平。
    国际委员会对于解决就地复员、交换战俘和被拘平民、使全体柬埔寨公民参加国家生活以及外国军队撤离柬埔寨等问题，提供了许多建设性的意见，由于柬埔寨王国政府代表团同高棉抗战部队和柬埔寨境内越南志愿人员代表团之间观点有分歧，这些意见就更加重要。从一九五四年八月二十七日到十月十九日，柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会同柬埔寨联合停战委员会举行了七次会议来讨论共同有关的问题。
    在柬埔寨联合停战委员会解散以后，国际委员会继续帮助柬埔寨王国政府来解决使全体柬埔寨公民参加国家生活、恢复战时三十万被拘平民的自由等问题。
    柬埔寨王国军队总司令部代表团首席代表郎诺上校十月二十日在柴祯举行的会上发言时，以柬埔寨王国政府的名义感谢柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会对双方在执行停战协定方面所给予的巨大帮助。此外，在柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会同柬埔寨王国政府一九五四年十二月举行的会议上，柬埔寨政府首相彭诺特承认国际委员会是本着帮助这个国家的目的来到柬埔寨的，并且说柬埔寨王国政府除了要同柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会合作以外，别无他意。
    上述一些事实足以证明：柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会曾经努力去有效地执行日内瓦会议付托它的任务。目前，在实施柬埔寨停战协定方面，还有许多重要问题要解决。因此，按照日内瓦协定的规定，国际监督和监察委员会仍须在一个长时期内执行它的重大任务。
    美帝国主义者和它的仆从为了要解散国际监督和监察委员会而诽谤柬埔寨国际委员会无能，并且叫嚣说它已完成了任务，这就暴露了他们企图把国际委员会赶出柬埔寨的阴谋。他们这样做，就是为了能够轻易地破坏普选、破坏日内瓦协定和新恢复的柬埔寨的和平，并且把这个国家拖入东南亚侵略集团。
