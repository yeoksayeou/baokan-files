    Treat Farmers Withdrawing from Cooperatives With Enthusiasm
    Zhong Xia
    When Wenquan Township in the suburbs of Beijing was rectifying and consolidating its agricultural production cooperatives, some deviations occurred in handling the economic issues of farmers who were withdrawing from the cooperatives. An elderly farmer named Hao withdrew from the cooperative, but the cooperative did not consult with him properly and simply exchanged a piece of farmland for him. The old farmer measured the land for a long time and then told the cooperative director that it wasn't enough. The director said, "What does it matter if it's a little more or a little less? In another year or two, won't you have to join the cooperative again anyway? Just go back for now!" The old farmer had no choice but to leave in tears. The land of another farmer who withdrew from the cooperative was also exchanged in this way. This farmer also went to the cooperative cadre and said that it wasn't enough and he didn't want to exchange. The cadre said, "It was exchanged according to the land certificate, how could it be less?" The farmer realized that the tone was not right and dared not say anything more.
    The above-mentioned situation is not limited to the suburbs of Beijing. Qin Renxiang, a farmer in Youfang Township, Xingyang County, Henan Province, did not dare to go to the cooperative to retrieve his livestock for several days after withdrawing from the cooperative; Zhang He, a farmer in Xiahou Township, withdrew from the cooperative, and the cooperative did not return his investment, but he did not dare to urge them.
    These situations illustrate a major problem: many rural work cadres still cannot earnestly implement the principle of voluntarism when dealing with the issue of farmers joining or withdrawing from cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives are organizations voluntarily joined by working farmers, and both joining and withdrawing should be based on the farmers' willingness. When farmers are unwilling to join, we cannot force them. When farmers are determined to withdraw from the cooperative, we cannot force them to stay. Patient persuasion, sincere treatment, and consistently respecting the farmers' wishes, without political discrimination or economic damage, are the principles we must adhere to.
    In the process of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives, it is not surprising that some, or a minority, of the members who were originally forced to participate want to withdraw from the cooperative. Allowing these farmers who are unwilling to remain in the cooperative to withdraw will not cause any loss to the cooperative or to production. When farmers are not aware enough, the cooperative must be good at waiting for them. The cooperative will welcome farmers whenever they are willing to join. Farmers' economic status and political awareness vary, and the timing of their joining the cooperative will also vary. This requires being good at waiting. Being unwilling to wait for these farmers who have not yet decided to join the cooperative means not truly understanding the principle of voluntarism.
    Incorrectly handling the economic problems of farmers who withdraw from cooperatives is very harmful to the collectivization movement. When farmers withdraw from the cooperative, they should be allowed to take away their privately owned means of production, the share capital they have paid, and their production investments. If the cooperative needs to exchange land for the convenience of production, it must conduct good consultations with the individual and exchange it fairly with appropriate land completely based on his willingness. Any forced or disguised forced practices are wrong.

### 对待退社的农民也应该热情

    对待退社的农民也应该热情
    仲夏
    北京郊区温泉乡整顿巩固农业生产合作社的时候，处理退社农户的经济问题，发生了一些偏向。有一个姓郝的老年农民退出合作社，合作社没有和他很好地协商，就给他换了一块耕地。老农民到地里量了半天，找到合作社主任说，不够数。主任说：“多点少点有什么关系？再过一、两年，你不是还得入社吗？先回去吧！”老农民没有办法，哭着走了。另有一户退出合作社的农民的土地，也被这样换了。这一户农民也找到合作社的干部，说，不够数，不愿换。干部说：“按土地证换给你的，怎么会少？”这个农民听着口气不对，再也不敢作声了。
    上面说的这种情形，并不限于北京郊区。河南省荥阳县油坊乡农民秦仁箱退出合作社，好几天以后还不敢到社里牵他的牲口；夏候乡农民张合退出合作社，合作社不还他的投资款，他也不敢前去催要。
    这些情况说明了一个大问题，这就是，有许多农村工作干部处理农民入社退社问题的时候，还不能认真贯彻自愿原则。农业生产合作社是劳动农民自愿联合的组织，入社退社都应该听从农民的自愿。当农民不愿意联合的时候，我们不能勉强他。当农民决心退出合作社的时候，我们不能强留他。耐心说服，诚恳相待，始终尊重农民的意愿，政治上不加歧视，经济上不予损害，这就是我们要坚持的原则。
    在整顿农业生产合作社的过程中，有个别或少数原来就是勉强参加的社员要退出合作社，这是不足为怪的。允许这些不愿意留在合作社中的农民退出去，对合作社和对生产都不会有任何损失。农民觉悟不够的时候，合作社要善于等待他。农民何时愿意入社，合作社都会欢迎他。农民的经济地位和政治觉悟各有不同，入社迟早也会有所不同。这就必须善于等待。不愿意等待这些尚未下定决心参加合作社的农民，就是没有真正懂得自愿原则。
    错误地处理退出合作社的农民的经济问题，对合作化运动是十分有害的。农民退出合作社的时候，他私人所有的生产资料，所交纳的股份金和生产投资，应该允许他们带走。合作社如因生产方便需要调换土地，一定要和本人很好地进行协商，完全根据他的自愿，以适当的土地和他公平交换。任何强迫或变相强迫的作法都是不对的。
