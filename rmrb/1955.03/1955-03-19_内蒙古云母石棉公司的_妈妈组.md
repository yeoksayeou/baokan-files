    The "Mama Group" of the Inner Mongolia Mica Asbestos Company
    Jia Xiangxin
    In the Inner Mongolia Mica Asbestos Company's splitting workshop, whenever the workers mention the Guan Fengying Group, they say: "It is our banner."
    The Guan Fengying Group is a "Mama Group." All fourteen female workers in the group have children, but they have not delayed production because of raising children. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, female workers with children were driven out of the factory. Now, nurseries have been established in the factory, and the nursery workers take good care of the children. They know that this happy life is brought to them by the new China, and they also know that a good life depends on the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Therefore, they cherish time and do not let a minute pass in vain. Every time for breastfeeding, they quickly run to the nursery, feed the children well, and return to work. The worker Wang Luye said: Letting the children eat well, drink well, and play well, and not letting them get sick, is the responsibility of us mothers, just as it is the responsibility of workers to do a good job in production. Because they can take good care of their children, they rarely ask for leave due to children's illnesses, ensuring the normal attendance rate of the entire group. Therefore, from the second quarter of 1954 to the end of the year, this group was rated as an excellent group in the entire workshop for three consecutive quarters.
    In the past, some female workers in the splitting workshop were picky about the raw materials they used, and some even secretly tore up and threw away raw materials of lower quality. The female workers of the Guan Fengying Group were different. They thought: It takes a lot of effort for the workers in the mines to mine a piece of mica, and no piece of mica should be wasted. Wasting raw materials is wasting state property. Thanks to the continuous education of the workshop leaders and the impetus of the Guan Fengying Group, the phenomenon of being picky about raw materials has been basically overcome in the workshop.
    Under the cultivation and education of the Party, the class consciousness of the female workers of the Guan Fengying Group has been continuously improved. In labor competitions and various movements, they have taken the lead in responding to the Party's call. They often carry out criticism and self-criticism, and the whole group is very united. Group leader Guan Fengying cares very much about the members of the group. If someone's production decreases, the group immediately holds a meeting to find the reasons and study improvement methods. They know that if one person or one group fails to complete the plan, it will affect the entire company's production plan. (Originally published in Inner Mongolia Daily)

    内蒙古云母石棉公司的“妈妈组”
    贾相信
    在内蒙古云母石棉公司剥片车间里，工人们一提起关凤英小组，都说：“它是我们的旗帜。”
    关凤英小组是一个“妈妈组”。全组十四个女工都有小孩，可是她们并没有因为扶养小孩而耽误生产。在国民党反动派统治时期，女工们有了小孩就被撵出工厂，而现在工厂里建立了托儿所，保育员把小孩照顾得很好。她们知道这种幸福的生活是新中国给她们带来的，也知道美好的生活要依靠劳动生产率的不断提高，所以都很爱惜时间，不让一分钟白白地过去。每到喂奶的时间，她们都很快地跑到托儿所，给孩子吃好奶就回来上班。工人王绿叶说：让小孩吃好、喝好、玩好，不让他们生病，就是我们做妈妈的责任，也像搞好生产是工人的责任一样。因为她们都能很好地扶育小孩，很少因孩子闹病而请假，保证了全组的正常出勤率。因此，从一九五四年第二季度到年终，这个小组连续三个季度被评为全车间的优良小组。
    过去，剥片车间里有些女工在用原料时挑肥拣瘦，有的甚至偷偷把质量不高的原料撕破扔掉。关凤英小组的女工却不同，她们想：矿山上的工人们开采一块云母很费劲，一块云母片也不应糟蹋，浪费原料就是浪费国家财产。由于车间领导上的不断教育和关凤英小组的带动，车间里基本上克服了在使用原料时的挑肥拣瘦的现象。
    关凤英小组的女工们在党的培养教育下，阶级觉悟不断提高，在劳动竞赛和各种运动中，都带头响应党的号召。她们经常开展批评和自我批评，全组团结得很好。组长关凤英对组员们很关心，要是有一个人生产降低了，组里马上开会找原因，研究改进办法。她们知道，一个人或一个小组完不成计划，就会影响整个公司生产计划不能完成。  （原载内蒙古日报）
