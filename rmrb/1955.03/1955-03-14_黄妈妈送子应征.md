    Recently, Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang, the Special Class Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sent her youngest son, Jishu, to enlist in the People's Liberation Army.
    As early as last November, after hearing the news about the conscription of supplementary soldiers, Mama Huang repeatedly thought of the heroic image of her son Jiguang. When she saw her newly built tile-roofed house, saw the members of the agricultural production cooperative engaged in peaceful labor, and saw the enthusiastic letters from young people and children from all over the country, she felt even more resentful of the US imperialism's attempt to launch a war of aggression. She thought, "I cannot stand by and watch the socialist construction of the motherland be threatened and destroyed by US imperialism. In order to defend our homes and the country, and to liberate Taiwan, I should send Jishu to join the army." One night, Mama Huang called Jishu into her room and said, "Jishu, the country is recruiting supplementary soldiers, the task that your brother Jiguang didn't finish, can you go and complete it for him!" Jishu listened to his mother's words and excitedly said, "It is the responsibility of our youth to defend the motherland. Mom, don't worry, I will be the first to sign up for enlistment."
    In January of this year, Mama Huang had just returned home from a meeting in the province when Jishu told her that he had already written an application for enlistment at the county's youth militia representative meeting. Mama Huang happily said, "Good boy! If you hadn't applied, I would have rushed to do it for you!" Later, Mama Huang also spoke to everyone at the Jiguang Township Youth League meeting about her determination to send Jishu to join the army. Jishu immediately signed up at the meeting. At this time, a chorus of "I'm signing up!" rang out in the meeting place, and fifty-five young people of eligible age all signed up for enlistment. Driven by the heroic mother and younger brother, nearly 80% of the young people of eligible age in Jiguang Township signed up for enlistment.
    On the night before Jishu was to leave his hometown, Mama Huang and her son had a farewell talk under the lamplight. Mama Huang looked at her son with loving eyes and said, "Jishu, I love you as much as I loved your brother Jiguang. Your brother sacrificed to defend the motherland, and he performed meritorious service for the people. You must learn from your brother and remember that you are the younger brother of a hero." Jishu said excitedly, "When I think of my brother Jiguang, I will not be afraid of any difficulties. I must learn his heroic spirit and defend our great motherland." That night, Mama Huang and her son, who was about to embark on the post of defending the motherland, also made a covenant to encourage each other.
    The next day, Mama Huang personally sent her son to the district, and personally put two big red flowers on her son. Amidst the firecrackers and gongs and drums, Mama Huang held her son's hand and walked at the front of the send-off procession. She earnestly exhorted Jishu, saying, "You are a good son of your mother, and you must be a good soldier of the people. You must learn from your brother Jiguang and strive to perform meritorious service and become a hero!"

    黄妈妈送子应征
    新华社记者　周祖佑
    最近，中国人民志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝，送她最小的儿子继恕应征参加了人民解放军。
    早在去年十一月，黄妈妈听到征集补充兵员的消息后，就曾多次想起继光儿的英雄形象。当她看见自己新盖的瓦房，看到农业生产合作社的社员们正在进行和平劳动和来自祖国各地的青年和孩子们给她的热情的书信时，对美帝国主义企图发动侵略战争更加感到愤恨。她想：“我不能眼看着祖国社会主义建设受到美帝国主义的威胁和破坏。为了保家卫国，为了解放台湾，我应当把继恕送去参军。”有一天夜晚，黄妈妈把继恕叫到自己房里，说：“继恕，国家要征集补充兵员了，你继光哥哥没完成的任务，你能替他去完成了！”继恕听了妈妈的话，兴奋地说：“保卫祖国是我们青年的责任。妈，你放心，我一定首先报名应征。”
    今年一月，黄妈妈从省里开会刚回到家里，继恕便把他已经在全县青年民兵代表会上写了应征申请书的事告诉了妈妈。黄妈妈高兴地说：“好孩子！你若没申请，我还要替你抢个先哩！”后来，黄妈妈又在继光乡青年团员大会上向大家讲了送继恕应征入伍的决心。继恕也立刻在会上报了名。这时，会场上响起了一片“我报名！”
  “我报名！”的喊声，五十五个适龄青年都报名应征了。在英雄的母亲和弟弟的带动下，继光乡有近百分之八十的适龄青年都报名应征了。
    在继恕要离开家乡的前夜，黄妈妈和儿子在灯光下作了离别前的一次谈话。黄妈妈用热爱的眼光望着儿子说：“继恕，我爱你像爱你继光哥哥一样。你哥哥为保卫祖国牺牲了，他为人民立了功。你要向哥哥学习，记住你是英雄的弟弟。”继恕激动地说：“我想到继光哥哥时，什么困难都不会怕。我一定要学习他的英勇精神，保卫我们的伟大祖国。”这天夜晚，黄妈妈还和即将走上保卫祖国岗位的儿子互相订下了勉励的条约。
    第二天，黄妈妈亲自把儿子送到区上，并亲手给儿子戴上了两朵大红花，在鞭炮、锣鼓声中，黄妈妈拉着儿子的手走在送行队伍的最前面，她谆谆嘱咐着继恕说：“你是妈妈的好儿子，一定要做个人民的好战士。你要向继光哥哥学习，争取立功当英雄！”
