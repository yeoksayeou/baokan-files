Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 16th: The Sixth Session of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic opened in Warsaw on the 16th. Polish United Workers' Party and state leaders Bolesław Bierut, Aleksander Zawadzki, and Józef Cyrankiewicz attended the meeting.

The delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, headed by Volkov, was invited to attend the meeting and was warmly welcomed by all members of parliament.

The agenda adopted by the meeting included: the report by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz on the government's foreign policy, the draft national budget for 1955, and the report on the implementation of the national budget for 1953, etc.

After the agenda was adopted, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz made a report on the government's foreign policy.

Cyrankiewicz said that People's Poland has contributed, both in the past and at present, in all aspects of international cooperation, to strengthening world peace and promoting friendly relations between all peoples. Cooperating with other countries, striving to ease international tensions, and actively participating in eliminating hotbeds of war danger—this is the guiding principle of the Polish government's foreign policy.

Cyrankiewicz continued that the Polish government has never relaxed its efforts aimed at opposing the revival of German militarism and the division of Germany. It particularly warmly supports the Soviet Union's initiative to convene a conference of European countries to consider the issues of guaranteeing peace and security in Europe. Responsible politicians in our camp have already very firmly declared that our response to the re-militarization of West Germany will be to take steps to safeguard our country and prevent any and every attempt to violate our security or borders. The Polish government will persistently strive to achieve a peaceful solution to the German problem in accordance with the interests of Poland's peace and security and in accordance with the interests of all European peoples.

Cyrankiewicz said that the American aggressive bloc, playing with fire in Taiwan and the coastal islands of mainland China, has recently been particularly rampant. They are threatening with nuclear weapons. However, everyone knows that Soviet science and technology have made great achievements in this regard, so any clamor about American superiority is nothing more than empty fantasy. The most important factor in defeating the policy of intimidation with weapons of mass destruction is the consistent peace policy of the socialist camp countries, first and foremost the Soviet Union. The Polish people, through the Presidium of the Parliament and the Council of State, particularly warmly support the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on establishing close ties between the parliaments of various countries.

Cyrankiewicz continued that Poland's international position has been strengthened. People's Poland is a strong link in the chain of peace forces. Today, our borders and the fruits of our peaceful labor are protected not only by our own army, but also by the entire powerful peace camp, in which the freedom and independence of Poland and the inviolability of Poland's borders are a matter of common concern.

Cyrankiewicz finally talked about Poland's achievements in economic and cultural construction.

After Cyrankiewicz's report, the meeting proceeded to discussions.

At the afternoon session, the head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, Volkov, spoke.

He said: We believe that the invitation of the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to attend the session of the Polish Parliament is of great international significance, because it is a concrete step towards cooperation between the parliaments of various countries for peace.

Volkov pointed out that the proposal made by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for parliaments of various countries to cooperate in strengthening the struggle for peace has received widespread response from the public and parliamentarians around the world. The parliaments of the socialist camp countries have already declared their full support for the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. However, the parliaments of some countries in Western Europe and the Americas have not yet indicated their attitude towards this proposal.

Volkov said that the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals aimed at easing world tensions and consolidating the security of all peoples. However, the American aggressive bloc is flaunting its military power and threatening our socialist camp countries with a large-scale destructive atomic war. But we are not afraid of threats, because we have everything necessary to defend the freedom and independence of our peoples. The Soviet Union has powerful armed forces, equipped with the latest equipment, capable of inflicting a devastating blow on any aggressor. Defending peace and security together with the Soviet Union are the great People's Republic of China, Poland, and other people's democracies. We believe that the widespread struggle waged by peace-loving people in all countries can stop war and consolidate peace. The signature campaign for the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" currently underway in many countries once again vividly demonstrates the unshakable determination of the peoples of all countries to defend the cause of peace.

Volkov finally congratulated the Polish Parliament on the successful conclusion of the meeting. He also extended warm congratulations to the fraternal Polish people on behalf of the Soviet people.

    波兰议会第六次会议在华沙开幕
    西伦凯维兹报告政府的外交政策
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长沃尔科夫讲话
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社华沙十六日讯：波兰人民共和国议会第六次会议于十六日在华沙开幕。波兰统一工人党和国家的领导人贝鲁特、萨瓦茨基和西伦凯维兹等参加了会议。
    以沃尔科夫为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团应邀参加会议，受到了全体议员的热烈欢迎。
    会议通过的议程包括：部长会议主席西伦凯维兹的关于政府外交政策的报告，一九五五年国家预算草案和一九五三年国家预算执行情况的报告等。
    通过议程后，部长会议主席西伦凯维兹就政府的外交政策作了报告。
    西伦凯维兹说，人民波兰过去和现在都在国际合作的各方面对加强世界和平和促进各国人民之间的友好关系作出贡献。和其他国家合作，努力缓和国际紧张局势，积极参加消灭战争危险的温床——这就是波兰政府外交政策的指导方针。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，波兰政府从没有一刻松懈它以反对德国军国主义的复活和德国分裂为目的的努力。它特别热烈地支持苏联关于召开欧洲国家的考虑保障欧洲和平和安全问题的会议的倡议。我们阵营的负责的政治家们已经非常坚决地宣布，我们对西德重新军国主义化的答复将是采取步骤来保障我们的国家，防止侵犯我们的安全或边境的一切企图和每一个企图。波兰政府将坚持不懈地努力，来争取来根据波兰的和平和安全的利益、根据欧洲一切国家人民的利益，和平解决德国问题。
    西伦凯维兹说，在台湾和中国大陆沿海岛屿玩火的美国侵略集团最近特别嚣张。他们正在用核子武器来威胁。但是，大家知道，苏联的科学和技术已在这方面取得了巨大的成就，因此，关于美国优势的任何叫嚣都只不过是空洞的幻想而已。击败用大规模毁灭性武器进行恫吓的政策的最重要的因素，却是社会主义阵营各国的、首先是苏联的坚持不渝的和平政策。波兰人民通过议会主席团和国务委员会特别热烈地支持苏联最高苏维埃关于建立各国议会间的密切联系的宣言。
    西伦凯维兹继续说，波兰的国际地位已经加强了。人民波兰是和平力量链条中的坚强的一环。今天，我们的边疆和我们的和平劳动的果实不仅受到我们自己的军队的保护，而且也受到整个强大的和平阵营的保护，在这个阵营里，波兰的自由和独立以及波兰的疆界的不可侵犯性是一件大家共同关心的事情。
    西伦凯维兹最后谈到了波兰在经济和文化建设方面的成就。
    在西伦凯维兹报告后，会议就进行讨论。
    在下午会议上，苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长沃尔科夫讲了话。
    他说：我们认为，邀请苏联最高苏维埃代表团来参加波兰议会会议一事具有重大的国际意义，因为这是走向各国议会间为和平而合作的一个具体步骤。
    沃尔科夫指出，苏联最高苏维埃提出的主张各国议会在加强和平斗争方面进行合作的建议，获得了全世界公众和议会人士的广泛响应，社会主义阵营国家的议会已经宣布它们充分支持苏联最高苏维埃的宣言，然而，西欧和美洲若干国家的议会至今还没有表明它们对这个建议的态度。
    沃尔科夫说，苏联一再提出了目的在于缓和世界紧张局势和巩固各国人民安全的具体建议。而美国侵略集团却正在耀武扬威，拿大规模毁灭性的原子战争来威胁我们社会主义阵营国家。但是我们不怕威胁，因为我们掌握了为捍卫我们各国人民的自由和独立所必需的一切东西。苏联有强大的武装力量，拥有最新式的装备，能够给予任何侵略者以毁灭性的打击。同苏联一道捍卫和平和安全的，有伟大的中华人民共和国、波兰和其他人民民主国家。我们相信，各国爱好和平的人民广泛地展开斗争，就能够制止战争，巩固和平。目前在许多国家内展开的“告全世界人民书”签名运动又一次鲜明地显示了各国人民捍卫和平事业的不可动摇的决心。
    沃尔科夫最后祝贺波兰议会会议圆满结束。他还代表苏联人民向兄弟的波兰人民致以热烈的祝贺。
