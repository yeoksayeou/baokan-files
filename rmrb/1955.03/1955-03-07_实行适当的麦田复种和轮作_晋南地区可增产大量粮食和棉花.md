Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 6th: By implementing appropriate wheat field relay cropping and crop rotation, the cotton and wheat growing areas of southern Shanxi Province can further increase the production of large quantities of grain and cotton. This is the opinion recently put forward by Yang Shijie, Third Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after inspecting rural areas in southern Shanxi.

Yang Shijie's investigation revealed that if the wheat relay cropping area in the cotton and wheat region of southern Shanxi is increased by 10%, grain production could increase by 100 million jin. At the same time, after wheat field relay cropping creates conditions for cotton field rotation, in addition to guaranteeing an increase in cotton yield per unit area, it can also expand cotton fields. Yang Shijie said: At present, the agricultural production potential of southern Shanxi has not been fully realized. More than 30% of the total cultivated land in the area is used for cotton fields and 50% to 60% for wheat fields, with many fields not rotated for several years (meaning continuously planting one crop without rotation), and it is common to plant the same crop for ten consecutive years, making it difficult to increase cotton and wheat production. Wheat fields in southern Shanxi generally only have one crop per year, with very little relay cropping, resulting in large areas of land being "idle for half a year." Yang Shijie said: In the past, individual farmers could not rotate crops on small plots of land. Now that a large number of farmers have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations, conditions have begun to be created to change this unreasonable farming system. For example, under the leadership of the agricultural production cooperative in Xizhanggeng Township, Jieyu County, 28% of the wheat fields were planted with miscellaneous grains after the wheat harvest in 1954. Grain production increased, and the farmers' rations and livestock feed were adequately resolved. The township raised 400 pigs and 400 sheep each, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer. This reasonable rotation system should be promoted. There are many benefits to increasing one season of planting in wheat fields: 1. It can gradually implement cotton and wheat rotation, changing the unreasonable farming system of long-term continuous cropping; 2. It can create conditions for continuing to expand the cotton field area; 3. After the feed problem is solved, more pigs can be raised, which can both supply the people in economic crop areas with meat and help solve the current fertilizer shortage in economic crop areas.

Relevant units in Shanxi Province are now working according to Yang Shijie's opinions. Labor models from the southern Shanxi region who participated in the Shanxi Province 1954 Agricultural Production Model Award Conference and leading cadres from various places attending the Shanxi Province Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, and Water Conservancy Work Conference will formulate specific plans in conjunction with local conditions to gradually realize the above methods.

### 实行适当的麦田复种和轮作  晋南地区可增产大量粮食和棉花

    实行适当的麦田复种和轮作
    晋南地区可增产大量粮食和棉花
    据新华社太原六日电：只要实行适当的麦田复种和轮作，山西省南部棉麦区还可增产大量的粮食和棉花。这是中共山西省委员会第三书记杨士杰最近考察晋南农村之后提出的意见。
    杨士杰考察的结果说明：晋南棉麦区如增加百分之十的小麦复种面积，就可增产一亿斤粮食。同时，麦田复种给棉田轮作创造条件后，除能保证提高棉花单位面积产量外，还可扩大棉田。杨士杰说：目前晋南农业生产潜力没有得到充分发挥。占当地耕地总面积百分之三十以上的棉田和百分之五十到六十的麦田，几年不倒茬（即一直种一种作物，不轮作），连种十年的很普遍，因此棉、麦的增产很困难。晋南麦田一般一年只种一季，很少复种，形成大面积土地“半年闲”。杨士杰说：过去个体农民在小块土地上轮作不过来，现在大量农民参加互助合作组织后，开始为改变这种不合理的耕作制度创造了条件。例如：解虞县西张耿乡在农业生产合作社带动下，一九五四年有百分之二十八的麦田收麦后种了杂粮，粮食产量增加，农民的口粮和牲畜的饲料都得到适当的解决。全乡饲养猪、羊各四百只，积下大批肥料。这种合理的轮作制应该推广。麦田增种一季的好处很多：一、可以逐步实行棉、麦轮作，改变长期连作的不合理的耕作制度；二、可以为继续扩大棉田面积创造条件；三、饲料得到解决后可以多养猪，既可供应经济作物区人民肉食需要，也可以帮助解决经济作物区目前肥料不足的困难。
    现在山西省有关单位正根据杨士杰的意见进行工作。参加山西省一九五四年农业生产模范给奖大会晋南地区的劳动模范和各地出席山西省农、林、畜牧、水利工作会议的领导干部，都将结合当地情况订出具体计划，逐步实现上述办法。
