    Xinhua News Agency, March 15th, Ulaanbaatar dispatch: The 1955 Sino-Mongolian Cultural Cooperation Implementation Plan, formulated according to the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, was exchanged on March 14th in Ulaanbaatar after consultations between China and Mongolia. He Ying, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the People's Republic of Mongolia, and Jalkhasaikhan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Mongolia, represented their respective governments.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 15th, TASS Ulaanbaatar dispatch: Preparations for the Moscow-Ulaanbaatar-Beijing joint transportation line are actively underway. Currently, employees who will serve on this new trunk line are being trained, especially drivers of the diesel-electric locomotives supplied by the Soviet Union.
    Railway transportation plays an increasingly important role in the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1954, the Ulaanbaatar railway line overfulfilled its plan in all aspects. The number of heavy trains doubled compared to 1953. Much work has also been done in personnel training. With the help of Soviet experts, a total of more than 1,300 railway employees have been trained. The number of train drivers has more than tripled in one year.

    蒙古积极进行莫斯科—乌兰巴托—北京线联运准备工作
    【新华社十五日讯】乌兰巴托消息：根据中蒙经济及文化合作协定制订的中蒙一九五五年文化合作执行计划，经中蒙双方商谈协议后，已于三月十四日在乌兰巴托由中华人民共和国驻蒙古人民共和国特命全权大使何英和蒙古人民共和国外交部长贾尔卡赛汗分别代表双方政府换文。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社乌兰巴托讯：莫斯科—乌兰巴托—北京线联运的准备工作正在积极进行。目前正在训练在这条新干线上服务的员工，特别是训练驾驶苏联供给的柴油电气机车的司机人员。
    铁路运输在蒙古人民共和国的国民经济中起着越来越大的作用。一九五四年，乌兰巴托铁路线在各方面都超额完成计划。重型火车的数量比一九五三年增加了一倍。在训练人员方面也做了许多工作，在苏联专家们的帮助下，共训练了一千三百多名铁路员工。火车司机的人数在一年中增加了三倍多。
