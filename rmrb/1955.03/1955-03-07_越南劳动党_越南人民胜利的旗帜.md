On March 3rd, the golden-starred red flag was hung high everywhere in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in towns and villages throughout the country. Vietnamese workers, peasants, other laborers, and people from all walks of life celebrated the birthday of the working class and laboring people's party – the Vietnamese Labor Party – with great joy.

That evening, President Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups, hosted a banquet in the capital to celebrate; at the same time, a celebration meeting was held at the Hanoi Grand Theater. Pham Van Dong, Hoang Quoc Viet, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Luong Bang, Le Van Luong, and Ton Duc Thang, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and members of the Central Committee, entered the venue amidst the cheers of the crowd.

After Hoang Quoc Viet delivered a report on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party on the commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese Labor Party, representatives of the Vietnamese Socialist Party, the Vietnamese Democratic Party, and representatives of workers, peasants, and intellectuals spoke successively, unanimously praising and supporting the correct leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and expressing their determination to continue to fight under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of Vietnam, and for the complete liberation of Vietnam.

People recalled with reverence the glorious history of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the representative of the Vietnamese workers, laborers, and the entire nation.

The Vietnamese Labor Party was founded on March 3, 1951. Over the past four years, the Vietnamese Labor Party has led the Vietnamese people in effective struggles and achieved unprecedented victories, crushing and stopping the French colonialists and American imperialists' conspiracy to re-enslave Vietnam and expand the Indochina war of aggression, and winning peace. Now, the Vietnamese Labor Party is leading the people in huge work for the recovery and construction of the economy, for the consolidation of peace, the realization of national unification, and the completion of national independence and democracy.

The predecessor of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Indochinese Communist Party, was founded on January 6, 1930. The party was initially named the Vietnamese Communist Party. According to the needs of the situation, the first meeting of the Provisional Central Committee of the Party in October 1930 decided to change its name to the Eastern Ocean (Indochinese) Communist Party; in February 1951, the Second National Congress of the Party decided to change its name to the Vietnamese Labor Party and formulated new party programs and constitutions.

The Vietnamese Labor Party inherits all the fine traditions of the Vietnamese national history and, on the basis of its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, victoriously promotes the national democratic revolution forward.

In the short period of twenty-five years since the founding of the Party, the entire social face of Vietnam has undergone fundamental changes. The Vietnamese people have been liberated from the long-term feudal rule and imperialist oppression of thousands of years and have established their own country – the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Vietnamese Labor Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, have proved with their own practical actions that they are the most thorough supporters and the most loyal representatives of the interests of the Vietnamese working class, the laboring people, and the entire nation; it is the never-ending torch for the Vietnamese people on the path of liberation, and the banner of victory for the Vietnamese people.

The heroic, hardworking, simple, and tenacious Vietnamese people have carried out repeated struggles for nearly a century to oppose the French imperialist aggression and overthrow the brutal colonial rule. However, only after the birth of the Communist Party, the political party of the Vietnamese working class, did the Vietnamese people's independence and liberation movement enter a completely new historical period.

After the First World War, in order to make up for its losses in the war and save its economic crisis, French imperialism implemented a "special colonial development" policy in Indochina, stepping up the plunder of Indochina, especially Vietnam's resources. With the increase of mines, processing factories, rubber plantations, and various plantations, the Vietnamese working class also grew up. In order to resist the particularly barbaric exploitation of the French colonialists, the Vietnamese working class began heroic struggles from the time of its formation. From 1924 to 1929, the labor movement developed more vigorously. Workers in French factories, mines, and plantations in Saigon, Haiphong, Nam Dinh, Hong Gai, Nghe An, and other places successively held strikes. Among them, the strike of 5,000 workers in the Nam Dinh yarn factory and the strike of 20,000 miners in the Hong Gai coal mine were unprecedented.

During this period, under the influence of the victory of the Great October Revolution in Russia and encouraged by the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement, several Marxist groups appeared in Vietnam on the basis of the labor movement. These organizations were unified into the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1930, later renamed the Indochinese Communist Party.

The political party of the Vietnamese working class, established in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, put forward the famous January Program on the day of its birth. This program clearly stipulated its task – to lead the working class, peasants, and other laboring people, unite all patriotic elements, resolutely oppose imperialism and feudalism, realize peace, unification, independence, and democracy, complete the national democratic revolution, and further prepare conditions for the establishment of a happy socialist society.

For twenty-five years, the Indochinese Communist Party – the Vietnamese Labor Party has experienced various hardships and various forms of struggle, unswervingly holding high the banner of national liberation and people's democracy, leading the Vietnamese people forward along the road to victory.

In September 1930, shortly after the establishment of the Party, it led the historically significant "Nghe-An Soviet Movement," establishing the first people's political power in three districts of Nghe-An Province and Ha Tinh Province. Although this movement eventually failed under the crazy attack of the French colonialists, it left an extremely profound impact on the Vietnamese people. In September 1940, when the Japanese fascists invaded Vietnam and the French colonialists surrendered, the Party put forward the slogan of armed "resistance to Japan and opposition to France," organized the famous uprisings of Bac Son, Nam Ky, and Do Luong, and began to establish Vietnamese people's armed forces and revolutionary base areas. In early 1945, according to an analysis of the international and domestic situation, the Indochinese Communist Party put forward the slogan of preparing for a nationwide general uprising and carried out practical preparations. In August, when the Japanese fascists rapidly collapsed under the hammer blows of the heroic Soviet Red Army, the masses in various places were widely mobilized under the leadership of the Party organization. On August 19th, the Indochinese Communist Party, with unparalleled courage and determination, led the people of the whole country to launch a general uprising, which is the famous "August Revolution." The "August Revolution" ended nearly a century of French colonial rule and established a people's democratic government throughout Vietnam. Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the founder and organizer of the Indochinese Communist Party and the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups, was unanimously elected as the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

However, the imperialists were not reconciled to the Vietnamese people gaining freedom. They attempted to strangle the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam and suppress the increasingly vigorous people's liberation movement in Southeast Asian colonies. As soon as the war ended, they colluded to attack the Vietnamese people. They took the 16th parallel north latitude as the boundary, and Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, and the French colonialists, under the cover of the British army, invaded the Vietnamese border separately. On December 19, 1946, the French colonialists, with the support of American imperialism, completely tore up the "March 6th" Agreement and the "September 14th" Agreement and launched a full-scale invasion of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Indochinese Communist Party, foreseeing the invaders' conspiracy, bravely and firmly stood at the forefront of the struggle, calling on all the people to mobilize urgently to fight for the defense of the motherland's independence and peace.

Based on an analysis of the enemy's and our own struggle situation, the Party put forward the strategic policy of long-term, arduous, and self-reliant struggle, leading the Vietnamese people to push the war of resistance step by step to victory. In addition to paying close attention to the construction of the Vietnam People's Army, the defender of Vietnam's peace and independence, and paying close attention to the consolidation and development of the national democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance, the Party also paid special attention to the strength of the resistance and the productive forces to liberate the countryside, and took various measures to adapt to the development of the situation. By 1953, the Vietnamese Labor Party proposed reforming the feudal land system in rural areas to realize "land to the tiller." These measures provided a favorable basis for the victory of the war of resistance and the construction of the country.

In the spring of 1954, the Vietnamese Labor Party, with a decisive spirit and brilliant planning, commanded the Dien Bien Phu Campaign and achieved a historic victory. On the basis of this victory, the Geneva Accords were signed, restoring peace to Vietnam and creating the conditions for seeking national unification in a peaceful manner and establishing a new Vietnam that is independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong.

After the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese Labor Party resolutely led the Vietnamese people in unremitting efforts to consolidate peace, consolidate the ceasefire, heal the wounds of war, and restore construction, and has already achieved brilliant achievements. In just half a year, north of the 17th parallel, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Vietnamese people have repaired and newly built six relatively large-scale water conservancy projects, which can irrigate approximately 450,000 mu of paddy fields (North Vietnamese mu, each mu is approximately equal to more than five Chinese mu); especially in the short period of four months, they repaired 166 kilometers and 600 meters of the Hanoi-Muc Nam Quan railway, which is of great significance to the recovery and construction of the Vietnamese national economy.

The Vietnamese people are now moving forward with full confidence in the direction pointed out by their standard-bearer, the Vietnamese Labor Party – peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity. As Comrade Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnamese Labor Party, said: "The Vietnamese Labor Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, have led the Vietnamese people forward along the road to victory. History proves that the Party is the true and most loyal representative of the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups. With the leadership of the Party, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to move from victory to victory."

    越南劳动党——越南人民胜利的旗帜
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    三月三日，在越南民主共和国首都河内以及各地城镇和农村，到处都高悬起金星红旗。越南工人、农民，其他劳动者以及各阶层人民，都以极其愉快的心情欢庆工人阶级和劳动人民的政党——越南劳动党的生日。
    这一天晚上，越南劳动党、越南各族人民的领袖胡志明主席在首都设宴庆祝；同时，在河内大戏院举行了庆祝大会。范文同、黄国越、武元甲、阮良朋、黎文良以及孙德胜等越南劳动党中央政治局委员、中央委员，在群众欢呼声中进入了会场。
    黄国越代表越南劳动党中央作关于纪念越南劳动党成立四周年的报告后，越南社会党、越南民主党的代表和工人、农民、知识分子代表相继讲话，一致赞扬和拥护越南劳动党的正确领导，并表示要继续在越南劳动党的领导下，为越南的和平、统一、独立、民主，为越南的彻底解放而奋斗。
    人们怀着崇敬的心情回忆越南工人、劳动者以及全民族的代表越南劳动党的光辉的历史。
    一九五一年三月三日，越南劳动党宣告成立。四年来，越南劳动党领导着越南人民进行成效卓著的斗争，取得了空前的胜利，粉碎并制止了法国殖民者和美帝国主义重新奴役越南并扩大印度支那侵略战争的阴谋，赢得了和平。现在，越南劳动党正领导着人民为经济的恢复和建设，为巩固和平、实现国家的统一、完成全国的独立和民主，进行着巨大的工作。
    越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党，成立于一九三零年一月六日。党最初定名为越南共产党。根据形势的需要，一九三零年十月，党临时中央委员会第一次会议决定改名为东洋（印度支那）共产党；一九五一年二月，党第二次全国代表大会决定改名为越南劳动党，并制订了新的党纲和党章。
    越南劳动党继承着越南民族历史上一切优良的传统，在它的前身印度支那共产党的基础上，把民族民主革命胜利地向前推进。
    在党成立以来二十五年不长的时期里，越南整个社会面貌已发生了根本的变化。越南人民从千百年来长期的封建统治和帝国主义压迫下解放出来，建立起自己的国家——越南民主共和国。
    越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党，以自己的实际行动，证明它是越南工人阶级、劳动人民，以及整个民族利益最彻底的拥护者和最忠实的代表者；它是越南人民在解放的途程中永不熄灭的火炬，是越南人民胜利的旗帜。
    英勇、勤劳、质朴、坚韧的越南人民，近百年来，为了反对法帝国主义的侵略、为了推翻残暴的殖民地统治，进行了再接再厉的斗争。但是，只有当越南工人阶级的政党共产党诞生后，越南人民的独立解放运动才进入一个完全新的历史时期。
    第一次世界大战后，法帝国主义为了弥补其在战争中的损失和挽救其经济危机，在印度支那实行“殖民地特别开拓”政策，加紧掠夺印度支那、特别是越南的资源。随着矿场、加工工厂、橡胶园和各种种植园的增加，越南工人阶级也成长起来了。为了反抗法国殖民者特别野蛮的压榨，越南工人阶级自形成时起就开始了英勇的斗争。一九二四年到一九二九年，工人运动更加蓬勃发展，在西贡、海防、南定、鸿基、义安等地的法国工厂、矿场、种植园的工人，都先后举行了罢工运动，其中南定纱厂五千工人的罢工和鸿基煤矿两万矿工的罢工，更是前所未有的事。
    这个时期，在俄国伟大十月革命胜利的影响之下，并受到中国革命运动发展的鼓舞，在工人运动的基础上，越南出现了若干马克思主义的团体，这些组织到一九三零年统一组成为越南共产党，后来改名印度支那共产党。
    按照马克思列宁主义原则建立起来的越南工人阶级的政党，在它诞生的那天，就提出了有名的一月政纲，这个政纲明确地规定自己的任务——领导工人阶级、农民和其他劳动人民，团结一切爱国分子，坚决反对帝国主义和封建主义，实现和平、统一、独立和民主，完成民族民主革命，进一步为建立幸福的社会主义社会准备条件。
    二十五年来，印度支那共产党——越南劳动党经历了各种艰难困苦和各种斗争形式，始终不渝地高举着民族解放和人民民主的大旗，领导越南人民沿着胜利的道路前进。
    一九三零年九月，党成立不久，就领导了富有历史意义的“义安苏维埃运动”，在义安省和河静省三个县建立第一个人民政权。这次运动最后虽然在法国殖民者疯狂进攻下失败了，但是却在越南人民中留下了极深刻的影响。一九四零年九月，当日本法西斯入侵越南、法国殖民者屈膝投降的时候，党提出了武装“抗日、反法”的口号，组织了有名的北山、南圻、都良的起义，并开始建立越南人民武装和革命根据地。一九四五年初，印度支那共产党根据对国际国内形势的分析，提出准备全国总起义的口号并进行了实际的准备工作。八月，当日本法西斯在英勇的苏联红军捶击下迅速地崩垮时，各地群众就在党组织的领导下广泛发动起来。八月十九日，印度支那共产党以无比的勇气和决心，领导全国人民举行总起义，这就是有名的“八月革命”。“八月革命”结束了将近一世纪的法国殖民统治，在越南全国范围内建立起人民民主政权。印度支那共产党的创始者和组织者、越南各族人民所爱戴的领袖——胡志明同志，被一致选举为越南民主共和国主席。
    但是，帝国主义者并不甘心越南人民获得自由，他们企图扼杀年轻的越南民主共和国，镇压日益蓬勃发展着的东南亚殖民地人民解放运动，当大战刚一结束，就勾结起来进攻越南人民。他们以北纬十六度为界，由美帝国主义走狗蒋介石和在英军掩护下的法国殖民者分头进犯越南国境。一九四六年十二月十九日，法国殖民者更在美帝国主义支持下彻底撕毁“三·六”协定和“九·一四”协定，向越南民主共和国发动了全面的进犯。
    预见到侵略者的阴谋的印度支那共产党勇敢而坚定地站在斗争的最前列，号召全体人民紧急动员起来，为保卫祖国的独立与和平而战。
    党根据敌我斗争形势的分析，提出了长期、艰苦、自力更生的战略方针，领导着越南人民把抗战一步步推向胜利。党除了十分关注越南和平、独立的保卫者越南人民军的建设、关注以工农联盟为基础的民族民主统一战线的巩固和发展外，并特别关注生息抗战力量和解放农村的生产力，采取了各种适应形势发展的措施。到一九五三年，越南劳动党提出改革农村的封建土地制度，实现“耕者有其田”。这些措施，为抗战的胜利和国家的建设提供了有利的基础。
    一九五四年春，越南劳动党以果断的精神、英明的策划，指挥奠边府战役取得了历史性的胜利。在这一胜利的基础上，签订了日内瓦协定，恢复了越南的和平，创造了以和平方式求得全国统一，建立一个独立、民主、繁荣和富强的新越南的条件。
    和平恢复后，越南劳动党坚决地领导着越南人民为巩固和平、巩固停战，为医治战争创伤、恢复建设坚持不懈地努力着，并且已经取得了辉煌的成就。仅只半年功夫，在北纬十七度以北，越南人民在党和政府的领导下，已经修复和新建了规模比较大的水利工程六处，约可灌溉水田四十五万亩（北越亩，每亩约等于中国五亩多）；特别是在四个月短促的时间内修复了一百六十六公里又六百公尺长的河内—睦南关铁路，这对越南国民经济的恢复和建设具有极大意义。
    越南人民现在正在满怀着信心，向着自己的旗手越南劳动党所指引的方向——和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣迈进。正像越南劳动党总书记长征同志所说的：“越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党领导着越南人民沿着胜利的道路向前迈进。历史证明：党是越南各族人民真正的、最忠实的代表。有了党的领导，越南人民一定能够从胜利走向胜利。”
