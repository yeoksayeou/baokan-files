Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 23rd: The National Expanded Representative Conference of the Burma Peace Committee concluded on the 20th after holding meetings for three days. The conference adopted a letter to the people of Burma, a letter to the prime ministers and representatives attending the Asian-African Conference, and various resolutions.

The letter to the prime ministers and representatives of the Asian-African Conference stated that war groups are currently clamoring madly for war in the Asian and African regions, establishing various aggressive blocs and signing agreements to divide and undermine the unity between Asian countries. They are attempting to instigate Asians to slaughter each other, and this crisis is threatening us. Under these circumstances, Asian and African countries must vow never to wage wars of mutual slaughter under any circumstances. Asian and African countries must make greater efforts to consolidate friendly cooperation between countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed by the Prime Ministers of Burma, India, and the People's Republic of China are the foundation of peace. The people of the world warmly support these Five Principles, and they should continue to be expanded and implemented in the future. The document concluded by expressing the hope that the Asian-African Conference could realize the aspirations for defending peace and opposing war.

The conference also passed the following resolutions: extensively carry out the work of defending world peace; warmly welcome and support the Asian countries conference scheduled to be held in Delhi, India in early April, and welcome and support the World Peace Congress; demand the prohibition of atomic weapons; expel the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops from Burma, and protest against the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc; welcome the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expand the peace zone; oppose the rearmament of Japan; Taiwan should be returned to China, and China's legitimate status in the United Nations should be restored; thoroughly resolve the Korean and Indochina issues; promote trade and cultural exchanges between countries; and oppose the rearmament of West Germany.

The conference elected the leading body of the Burma Peace Committee headed by Thakin Kodaw Hmaing.
