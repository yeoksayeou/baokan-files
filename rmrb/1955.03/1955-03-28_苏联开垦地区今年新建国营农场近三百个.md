Xinhua News Agency Report: Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms has established 297 new grain state farms in the eastern and southeastern reclamation areas. These state farms occupy a total area of more than 6 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu).

The newly established state farms have been equipped with farm managers and experts. More than 10,000 agricultural machine operators and mechanics have arrived in the reclamation areas to participate in the preparation for spring sowing and the preparation of local building materials for the new state farms. 66,000 skilled workers and more than 7,000 experts will also arrive in the reclamation area soon to participate in the work of these new farms. The mechanized schools affiliated with the labor reserve system in various places are still training 53,000 tractor drivers and combine operators for these state farms.

This spring, these newly established state farms will reclaim a total of about 4 million hectares of virgin and fallow land. Including the 124 state farms established last year, the state farms in all eastern and southeastern reclamation areas will sow a total of 6.8 million hectares of spring-sown grains and other crops. At present, spring sowing has begun in the southern part of the Kazakh Republic, the main reclamation area.

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Kazakh Republic and the Altai Krai, the main reclamation areas in the Soviet Union, are preparing for spring production. Collective farmers and state farm workers are busy transporting fertilizers to the fields, selecting seeds, and repairing farm tools. People participating in the reclamation work this year have arrived in the reclamation areas one after another. The newly established state farms are also preparing for spring farming.

The Kazakh Republic's reclamation area is now establishing 250 large-scale grain farms and 26 machine tractor stations. Due to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland, this year's cultivated area in Kazakhstan will increase to 19 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu). Now, a large amount of technical equipment is being continuously sent to the Kazakh reclamation area. A total of 98,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) will be shipped in successively this year.

Agricultural workers in the Altai Krai plan to harvest 500 million poods (1 pood equals 32.76 jin) of grain this year, an increase of about 100 million poods compared to last year. At present, spring production preparations are proceeding rapidly throughout the krai.

Xinhua News Agency Report: According to the "Agriculture Newspaper", a tall and beautiful building has recently been erected in a scenic spot in Kislovodsk, one of the best sanatoriums in the Soviet Union. This is the sanatorium of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Stavropol Krai of the Russian Federation. It has the latest medical equipment, exquisite furniture, tableware and other facilities. After the sanatorium is opened, the Stalin Collective Farm will have 50 members take the farm's bus every month for vacation and recuperation. Their food expenses are entirely borne by the collective farm.

The Stalin Collective Farm is famous in the Stavropol Krai for its production achievements and prosperous life. In 1954, it harvested an average of 19.6 quintals of wheat per hectare from 6,438 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of land. The harvest of other crops was also good. In terms of animal husbandry, the collective farm obtained 63 quintals of milk, 30.8 quintals of meat, and 1.83 quintals of wool from 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture last year, which increased by 3.7 times, 4.4 times, and 3.6 times respectively compared to 1950.

    苏联开垦地区今年新建国营农场近三百个
    据新华社讯：今年以来，苏联国营农场部已经在东部和东南部开垦地区成立了二百九十七个新的谷物国营农场。这些国营农场共占地六百多万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。
    今年新建的国营农场已经配备好了场长和专家。有一万多个农业机器操使者和机械士已经到达开垦地区，参加了新国营农场准备春播和准备地方建筑材料的工作。有六万六千个熟练工人和七千多个专家最近也将到开垦区参加这些新农场的工作。各地劳动后备系统所属机械化学校现在还在为这些国营农场培养五万三千个拖拉机手和联合机手。
    今年春季，这些新成立的国营农场总共将开垦约四百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地。连去年成立的一百二十四个国营农场在内，所有东部和东南部开垦地区的国营农场总共将播种六百八十万公顷春播谷物和其他作物。目前，春播工作已经在主要开垦地区哈萨克共和国的南部开始。
    据新华社讯：苏联主要开垦地区哈萨克共和国和阿尔泰边疆区正在进行春季生产的准备工作。集体农民和国营农场工作人员正忙着向田间运送肥料，选择种籽和修理农具。今年参加开垦工作的人已经陆续到达开垦地区。新建立的国营农场也在紧张地迎接春耕生产。
    哈萨克共和国开垦地区现在正在建立二百五十个大型谷物农场和二十六个机器拖拉机站。由于大量开垦荒地，今年哈萨克的耕地面积将增加到一千九百万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。现在，大量技术装备正源源送到哈萨克开垦地区。今年总共将陆续运来九万八千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）。
    阿尔泰边疆区的农业劳动者今年计划要收获五亿普特（每普特合三二点七六市斤）谷物，比去年约增加一亿普特。目前，边疆区各地的春季生产的准备工作正迅速进行。
    据新华社讯：据“农业报”报道：在苏联最好的疗养地之一——基斯洛沃德斯克的一个风景优美的地方，最近建立起一幢高大美丽的建筑物。这就是俄罗斯联邦斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区斯大林集体农庄的疗养院。它拥有最新式的医疗器械，精美的家具、食具和其他设备。在疗养院开放后，斯大林集体农庄每个月将有五十个庄员坐农庄的公共汽车来休假和疗养。他们的伙食费用完全由农庄负担。
    斯大林集体农庄以它的生产成就和富裕的生活闻名于斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区。一九五四年，它从六千四百三十八公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）土地上，每公顷平均收获了十九点六公担小麦。其他农作物的收成也很好。在畜牧业方面，集体农庄去年从一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场上获得了六十三公担牛奶，三十点八公担肉类，一点八三公担羊毛，即分别增加为一九五○年的三点七倍、四点四倍和三点六倍。
