Large Quantities of Three-Tooth Lightweight Weeders Supplied to Farmers

    This year, the state will supply over 62,000 three-tooth lightweight weeders (cultivators) to farmers in twenty provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Rehe, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, as well as the suburbs of Beijing and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On March 2, the Ministry of Agriculture, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and the Head Office of the People's Bank jointly issued instructions requiring their subordinate units to do a good job in promoting, manufacturing, and supplying three-tooth lightweight weeders this year.

    The three-tooth lightweight weeder is a new type of animal-powered cultivating (weeding) tool. The use of this new type of animal-powered agricultural tool can reduce farmers' physical labor and improve work efficiency. One person can only weed two to three mu of land per day with a "hand hoe," but with a three-tooth lightweight weeder, two people and one animal can weed twenty to thirty mu per day. This hoe is lightweight and can be used by women and semi-able-bodied laborers, and can be pulled by a small animal. At the same time, the height of the handle, the angle of the teeth into the soil, and the width of the hoe can be adjusted at will, making it quite convenient to use and greatly contributing to ensuring increased agricultural production.

    Currently, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry has organized thirteen factories to rush-produce three-tooth lightweight weeders, and it is expected that more than 61,600 units can be manufactured before the end of April. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are successively supplying the three-tooth lightweight weeders produced by the factories to farmers, with plans to supply all of them to farmers by the end of May. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the four provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, and Henan had already purchased more than 21,000 three-tooth lightweight weeders in early February; in Heilongjiang Province alone, 4,700 units have already been supplied to agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    大批三齿轻便耘锄供应农民
    今年国家将以六万二千多部三齿轻便耘锄（中耕器）供应给河北、山西、河南、山东、热河、陕西、江西等二十个省和北京市郊区、内蒙古自治区的农民。三月二日，农业部、第一机械工业部、全国供销合作总社、人民银行总行发出联合指示，要求所属做好今年推广、制造和供应三齿轻便耘锄的工作。
    三齿轻便耘锄是一种新式畜力中耕（锄地）农具。使用这种新式畜力农具能减轻农民的体力劳动，提高工作效率。一个人用“手锄”每天只能锄二亩到三亩地，使用三齿轻便耘锄，两个人加一头牲口，每天能锄二十亩到三十亩。这种锄锄身轻便，妇女和半劳动力都可以使用，一头小牲口就可以拉动。同时，这种锄手柄高低、锄齿入土角度和锄头宽窄可以随意调节，使用起来相当方便，对保证农业增产有很大作用。
    目前，第一机械工业部已经组织了十三个工厂在赶制三齿轻便耘锄，预计在四月底以前可制造出六万一千六百多部。各地供销合作社正在把各厂制出的三齿轻便耘锄陆续供应农民，计划在五月底前后全部供应到农民手中。黑龙江、辽宁、吉林、河南四个省的供销合作社，在二月上旬就已经购进三齿轻便耘锄二万一千多部；仅黑龙江一个省，就已经供应给农业生产互助合作组织四千七百部。
