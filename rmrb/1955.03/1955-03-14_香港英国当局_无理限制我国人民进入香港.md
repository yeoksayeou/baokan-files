Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 13th: Since March 5th, the British authorities in Hong Kong have suddenly implemented extremely unreasonable restrictions on our people entering Hong Kong, stipulating that the number of our people entering Hong Kong each day must be balanced with the number leaving Hong Kong. Due to this unreasonable restriction, since March 5th, large numbers of travelers have been unreasonably denied entry to Hong Kong for days, and normal traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been adversely affected, the economic life of the local people has suffered losses, and a tense and uneasy situation has been created in the area.

A large number of travelers have encountered various difficulties due to the sudden obstruction. Our local authorities have taken measures to help resolve the situation. The Shenzhen Cultural Palace has been temporarily vacated to accommodate the travelers; arrangements have been made to care for women, the elderly, and children; and our local authorities have also provided appropriate relief to travelers whose travel expenses were insufficient due to being blocked.

The restrictions imposed by the British authorities in Hong Kong on Chinese people entering Hong Kong are unreasonable. They violate the long-standing practice in the area and harm the interests of the Chinese people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this unreasonable measure and hope that the British authorities in Hong Kong will immediately stop the unreasonable restrictions imposed on Chinese people entering Hong Kong.

    香港英国当局
    无理限制我国人民进入香港
    【新华社广州十三日电】自三月五日起，香港英国当局对我国人民进入香港，突然实行了极不合理的限制，限定我国人民每日进入香港的人数必须与离开香港的人数保持平衡。由于这种不合理限制，三月五日以后，连日曾有大批旅客被无理拒绝前往香港，粤港间的正常交通受到了不良影响，当地人民的经济生活遭到了损失，并且在该地造成了紧张与不安的局势。
    大批旅客因突然被阻遭到了种种困难，我地方当局已采取措施帮助解决。深圳文化宫已临时腾空，让旅客住宿；对妇女、老幼进行了安置照顾；对因被阻而旅费不够的旅客，我地方当局也给了适当救济。
    香港英国当局对中国人民进入香港的限制，是不合理的，它违反了该地长期存在的惯例和损害了中国人民的利益。中国人民坚决反对这种无理措施，并且希望香港英国当局立即停止对中国人民进入香港所加的无理限制。
