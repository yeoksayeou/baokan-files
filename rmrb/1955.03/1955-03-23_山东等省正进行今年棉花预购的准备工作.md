Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Since the listing of new cotton in 1954, cotton farmers in various regions have sold cotton to the state and returned pre-purchase deposits in accordance with the pre-purchase contracts. By the end of January 1955, supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhejiang Province had recovered 96.1 percent of the pre-purchased cotton and 91.3 percent of the deposits. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces have recovered more than 90 percent of the deposits. Supply and marketing cooperatives in other provinces are combining cotton procurement with the completion of last year's cotton pre-purchase contracts. Currently, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces are preparing for the 1955 cotton pre-purchase work.

In 1954, the state entrusted the supply and marketing cooperatives to pre-purchase 35.6 percent of the state's cotton purchase plan from cotton farmers. After receiving the pre-purchase deposits, cotton farmers solved the difficulty of insufficient funds in production. Cotton farmers in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, used the cotton pre-purchase deposits to purchase chemical fertilizers, oil cakes, pesticides, and other means of production worth more than 500 million yuan in old currency. After 11 cotton farming households in the Seventh Village of Yongfeng Township in this county used all the deposits to purchase means of production, their cotton production increased by 10 percent last year.

    山东等省正进行今年棉花预购的准备工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】一九五四年新棉上市以来，各地棉农按照棉花预购合同规定把棉花卖给国家，并归还预购定金。到一九五五年一月底止，浙江省的供销合作社已收回预购棉花百分之九十六点一，收回定金百分之九十一点三。山西、陕西、四川等省的供销合作社收回的定金均达百分之九十以上。其他各省的供销合作社正结合棉花收购，办理结束去年棉花预购合同工作。目前，山东、河南、山西等省的供销合作社正在进行一九五五年棉花预购的准备工作。
    一九五四年国家委托供销合作社向棉农预购的棉花占国家棉花收购计划的百分之三五点六。棉农领到预购定金后，解决了生产中资金不足的困难。四川省中江县棉农把棉花预购定金购买了价值旧币五亿元以上的化学肥料、油饼、农药和其他生产资料。这个县永丰乡第七村十一户棉农把定金全部购买生产资料后，去年的棉花增产一成。
