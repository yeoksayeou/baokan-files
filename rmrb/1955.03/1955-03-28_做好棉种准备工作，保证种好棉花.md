    Do a Good Job in Cotton Seed Preparation to Ensure Good Cotton Planting
    Wang Xiongshi Jin Xibin
    The cotton sowing season is fast approaching. To fulfill the cotton planting plan, ensure good cotton planting, and prevent seedling shortages due to poor cotton seed quality, all regions must seize the opportunity and further improve cotton seed preparation.
    This year, the amount of cotton seed transferred between provinces is very large. Such large-scale cotton seed transportation and supply is a very heavy task. All regions must strengthen specific organizational leadership in this work, and strictly prevent cotton seeds from heating up, deteriorating, or becoming damp and moldy during storage and transportation, causing losses. When supplying cotton seeds transferred from other regions to cotton farmers, the farmers should be informed of the source, characteristics, and quality of the varieties. Supplying cotton seeds to farmers who lack seeds as early as possible will not only stabilize their enthusiasm for cotton planting, but also give them time to select seeds, and reduce the difficulty of centralized storage by supply departments. In order to do a good job in the transportation and supply of cotton seeds, Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, has specially formed a "Cotton Seed Supply Headquarters." In some areas of Hebei Province, supply and marketing cooperatives issued "Cotton Seed Instructions" when supplying cotton seeds, clearly explaining the quality, germination rate, and sowing amount per mu to farmers. These practices are worth referencing.
    At present, the number of cotton seeds that can be supplemented by transfers from other regions to seed-deficient provinces and regions has been largely fixed. Areas with surplus cotton seeds have done their best to support seed-deficient areas. Therefore, areas that still feel that cotton seeds are insufficient must try their best to find solutions in their own regions. Although the amount of seed retained by cotton farmers last year has generally decreased, it is understood that cotton farmers still have a certain amount of seed cotton or some old cotton seeds in their hands. As long as these stored cotton are selected and provided with ginning facilities, the proportion of self-retained cotton seeds will increase. In areas where the amount of seed retained by cotton farmers is unbalanced, cotton farmers should also be mobilized to exchange and transfer seeds among themselves. When mobilizing cotton farmers to increase self-retained seeds and exchange and help each other, attention should be paid to eliminating the concerns of farmers with surplus cotton or seeds about unified purchase; at the same time, appropriate methods should be formulated to encourage and facilitate the exchange of cotton seeds. In addition, agricultural production cooperatives will develop rapidly this year. Since many farmers do not bring cotton seeds when they join the cooperatives, the phenomenon of seed shortage is aggravated. In areas with this situation, members who have newly joined the cooperative should be mobilized to bring their selected cotton seeds to the cooperative; the cooperative should also evaluate the cotton seeds brought by the members and give them appropriate compensation.
    This year, the quality of cotton seeds is generally poor. According to inspection, the maturity of cotton seeds in many areas is 10% to 30% lower than in previous years. In some areas, the germination rate of cotton seeds is only about 50%, and some are even as low as 30%. Therefore, all regions should adopt methods such as grain selection and wind selection to improve the quality of cotton seeds. Areas with insufficient cotton seeds should study and adopt sowing methods that are suitable for local conditions, save seeds, and do not affect seedling shortages, such as strip drilling and hole sowing; in cotton areas with short growing seasons and two-crop cultivation, seedling transplanting and other methods should be implemented. This year, the quality of cotton seeds is not high. Therefore, before cotton sowing, it is necessary to do a good job in cotton field preparation, moisture conservation, irrigation, and flood prevention to promote smooth emergence of cotton seeds. In order to ensure full seedlings in cotton fields, it is also necessary to mobilize farmers to retain cotton seeds for replanting and adopt seedling transplanting to fill gaps.
    This year's cotton planting task is large, and the cotton seed conditions are poor. Therefore, when solving the cotton seed problem, the publicity and education work for cotton farmers should be strengthened. Some cotton farmers are unwilling to use new cotton seeds transferred from other regions or cotton seeds of poor quality. Through patient explanation and dissemination of sowing and cultivation techniques suitable for these cotton seeds, they should be encouraged to voluntarily accept these cotton seeds and use them correctly. In response to this situation, Yuci Special District, Shanxi Province, has trained 600 cadres and is preparing to widely conduct technical instruction to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and the vast number of farmers before sowing. This approach is also necessary in other areas that transfer and replace cotton seeds in large quantities.

    做好棉种准备工作，保证种好棉花
    汪雄时  金熙彬
    目前已迫近棉花播种的时期，为了完成棉花播种计划，保证把棉花种好，防止因棉种质量不好发生缺苗现象，各地必须抓紧时机，进一步做好棉种的准备工作。
    今年省和省之间，棉种调剂的数量很大。这样大量棉种的调运、供应，是一件很繁重的工作。各地对这项工作必须加强具体组织领导，严密防止棉种在保管调运期间发热变质，或受潮霉烂，造成损失。把从外地调运来的棉种供应给棉农时，应向棉农交代品种的来源，品种的特性和品种的质量等。把棉种及早供应给缺种的棉农，既能稳定他们的植棉情绪，又能使他们有时间进行拣选，同时还可以减少供应部门集中保管的困难。湖北省汉川县为了做好棉种调运供应工作，专门组成了“棉种供应指挥部”。河北省有些地区的供销合作社，在供应棉种时，印发了“棉种说明书”，把棉种质量、发芽率、每亩播种用量等，都向农民交代清楚，这些作法都是值得参考的。
    目前缺种省区，能由外区调剂补充的棉种数量，已大体固定。棉种有余的地区，对缺种地区的支援已尽了最大的力量。因此，目前仍感棉种不足的地区，必须在本地区尽力设法解决。去年棉农留种数量虽然普遍减少，但是据了解，目前棉农手中还存有一定数量的籽棉或一些陈旧棉籽。只要对这些存棉加以拣选，并给以轧花的方便，自留棉种比重就会增加。在棉农留种数量不平衡的地区，还要发动棉农互相串换调剂。在动员棉农增加自留种及串换互济时，要注意消除存有余棉或余种的农户对统购方面的顾虑；同时应适当规定鼓励和便利串换棉种的办法。另外今年农业生产合作社将有大量发展，由于许多农户入社时不带棉种，更加重了缺乏棉种的现象。有这种情况的地区，应动员新入社的社员，把自己选留的棉种带到社里；社里也要对社员带来的棉种，评给适当的代价。
    今年棉种质量普遍较差，据检查：不少地区的棉种成熟度比往年降低百分之十至三十，有些地区棉种发芽率只有百分之五十左右，有的甚至低到百分之三十。因此，各地都应采用粒选、风选等方法，力求提高棉种质量。棉种数量不足的地区，应研究采用适宜当地条件的节省种子而又不致影响缺苗的播种方法，如实行条行点播、穴播；在生长期短和两熟栽培的棉区实行育苗移栽等办法。今年的棉种质量不高，因此，在棉花播种前必须做好棉田整地、保墒、灌溉、防涝等工作，促使棉种顺利出苗。为了保证棉田全苗，还必须动员农民保留补种用的棉种和采用移苗补缺的办法。
    今年植棉任务既大，而棉种条件又较差，因此在解决棉种问题时，应加强对棉农的宣传教育工作。有些棉农不愿意采用外地调来的新棉种或质量较差的棉种，应通过耐心解释和传播适宜这些棉种的播种和栽培技术，使他们自愿接受这些棉种，并能正确地加以应用。山西省榆次专区针对这种情况，已训练了六百名干部，准备在播种前向农业生产合作社、互助组和广大农民广泛进行技术传授。这种作法，在其他大量调剂棉种和更换棉种的地区，也是必要的。
