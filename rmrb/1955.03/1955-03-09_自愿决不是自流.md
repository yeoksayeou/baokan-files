    Voluntariness Is Absolutely Not Letting Things Drift
    Zhong Xia
    In Zhongjia Village, Huolu County, Hebei Province, there was originally only one agricultural production cooperative with eight households. Last autumn, it suddenly developed to two hundred and eighty-six households. Before rectifying the agricultural cooperative, the village cadres were trained in the county. After returning to the village, they called a meeting of the masses and said, "Our village's cooperative has made the mistake of forced orders; now, whoever wants to join the cooperative can join, and whoever doesn't want to can leave!" As a result, many cooperative members who could have been consolidated but were wavering and watching also withdrew from the cooperative. Originally, there was a "rush to establish," and now there was a "rush to dissolve." Seeing that the new cooperative members had all withdrawn, the original eight old cooperative members also felt uneasy. The cadres of Songshutai Village, Beipiao County, Rehe Province, did not actively educate the cooperative members, and as a result, half of the sixty-seven cooperative members withdrew from the agricultural cooperative.
    Such methods of rectifying cooperatives may only be individual cases. But the problems reflected here are worthy of our attention.
    The principle of voluntariness is a fundamental principle that should be adhered to throughout the process of establishing agricultural production cooperatives. Some regions did not adequately prepare when establishing agricultural production cooperatives, and the establishment work was very rough. They did not properly implement the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, so that the newly established agricultural production cooperatives have many complex problems that urgently need to be solved. Now, it is entirely necessary to re-educate the cooperative members ideologically with detailed and in-depth working methods, solve various specific problems, and make up for the shortcomings of the previous stage of work. However, these complex problems must not be dealt with in a simple manner and with an attitude of laissez-faire.
    Of course, after various tasks have been carried out, if some people still want to withdraw from the cooperative, they should be allowed to withdraw. But if detailed ideological work and organizational work are not carried out, so that the agricultural cooperative that could have been consolidated collapses and disintegrates after "rectification," then it cannot be considered a true implementation of the principle of voluntariness.
    The ideological changes of peasants, especially middle peasants, in the collectivization movement are very complex, and wavering and watching are inevitable. In rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives, the main task is to understand various different thoughts and opinions and seek reasonable solutions to various problems. If we do not understand and deal with problems in this way, but simply announce "free withdrawal," the movement will inevitably become laissez-faire, go backwards, and frustrate the enthusiasm of activists. This is also detrimental to the healthy development of the collectivization movement in the future.
    The current issue is to redouble our efforts to implement the principle of voluntariness and to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives through patient education and ideological mobilization.

    自愿决不是自流
    仲夏
    河北省获鹿县钟家庄村，原来只有一个八户的农业生产合作社；去年秋季，一下发展了二百八十六户。在整顿农业合作社以前，村干部在县里受了训，回村以后，召集群众开会，说：“咱村办社，犯了强迫命令的错误；现在是谁愿办社就办，谁不愿办就散！”这样一来，有许多本来可以巩固住的动摇观望的社员也退了社。原来“一轰而起”，这时来了个“一轰而散”。看到新社员都退出社了，原来的八户老社员也心神不定了。热河省北票县松树台村的干部，不积极向社员进行教育，结果六十七户社员有半数退出农业合作社。
    像这种整顿合作社的方法，可能只是个别的。但这里所反映的问题，却很值得我们注意。
    自愿原则是建立农业生产合作社过程中应当始终坚持的基本原则。有些地区在建立农业生产合作社的时候，准备工作既不充分，建社工作又很粗糙，没有很好地贯彻自愿互利的原则，以致新建的农业生产合作社存在很多亟待解决的复杂问题。现在，以细致深入的工作方法，对社员再一次进行思想教育，解决各种具体问题，补足前一段工作的不足，是完全必要的。但是，决不可以简单方式和放任自流的态度来处理这些复杂问题。
    当然，在进行了各种工作以后，如果有些人还要退社，应当允许他们退出。但如不进行细致的思想工作和组织工作，使本来可能巩固的农业合作社，经过“整顿”反而垮台了，涣散了，那就不能认为是真正地贯彻了自愿原则。
   农民，特别是中农，在合作化运动中的思想变化是十分复杂的，动摇、观望是必不可免的。在整顿，巩固农业合作社当中，主要的工作就是要了解各种不同的思想和意见，求得各种问题的合理解决。不这样认识问题和处理问题，只是简单地宣布“自由退社”，必将使运动变成自流，走上回头路，并且会挫折积极分子的热情，这样做对于今后合作化运动的健康发展也很不利。
    当前的问题是要加倍努力贯彻自愿的原则，通过耐心的教育和思想动员，来巩固农业生产合作社。
