How to Increase Cotton Production
    Tian Liu Guo Shi

    I. Shanxi Province's Cotton Production Increases Every Year

    In 1954, China's cotton yield per unit area was still less than 30 jin of lint cotton per mu. If this yield could be increased, for example, to 45 jin of lint cotton per mu, how wonderful that would be! In that case, production could be increased by 50 percent on the basis of the 1954 output, which would be more than 10 million dan of lint cotton. Then, without expanding the cotton field area, it would be possible to meet the needs of the existing textile industry, and the people of the whole country would have more than enough cloth and other cotton textiles to wear and use.

    Increasing the unit area yield of cotton by half—this is not a fantasy. It has already become a reality in Shanxi Province. In 1954, the unit area yield of cotton fields in Shanxi Province, totaling 4.24 million mu, had reached 46.28 jin of lint cotton per mu. Shanxi Province's cotton is not only high in yield, but also good in quality: high ginning outturn, long fiber, and good color. Generally, 100 jin of seed cotton can produce 33 or 34 jin of lint cotton, and the fiber length is generally 24 mm. The best cotton produces 36.7 jin of lint cotton per 100 jin of seed cotton, and the fiber length is more than 28 mm. Long fibers and good color can be spun into high-grade yarn and woven into very good cloth, so that people can wear more beautiful clothes.

    Why is cotton production in Shanxi Province so high? Why is the quality so good? Is it because the soil and climate there are particularly superior and especially suitable for cotton crops to grow? No. So what is the reason? It is mainly due to improved cotton planting techniques. This technique is not some mysterious or profound technique. This technique was created by a farmer named Qu Yaoli. As long as someone accurately tells the farmers his cotton planting experience, the farmers will understand it as soon as they hear it; moreover, it costs little money and requires little effort to implement.

    II. Reducing "Post-Frost Flowers" is an Important Aspect of Improving Cotton Production and Quality

    Farmers in cotton-producing areas often lament when pulling cotton stalks in the autumn, saying, "There are still many bolls on the cotton stalks. If they all opened, how much more cotton could be picked!" This is true. If there is one unopened cotton boll on a cotton plant, and assuming there are 3,000 cotton plants per mu (Shanxi Province has densely planted 3,500 to 4,000 plants), there would be 3,000 bolls that did not open into flowers. At one jin per 100 flowers, that is 30 jin less harvest.

    Farmers in cotton-producing areas also often lament when picking the last blooms, saying, "Once it frosts, the cotton doesn't open well and becomes stiff." This is also true. "Post-frost flowers" have many stiff petals, poor color, low ginning outturn, short fibers, and are light in weight. If one jin of good cotton is worth 3 jiao, "post-frost flowers" are only worth 1 jiao.

    Therefore, how to promote early ripening of cotton, how to reduce "post-frost flowers," and how to make cotton bolls open before the frost becomes a very important thing to improve cotton production and quality. The reason why cotton production in Shanxi Province has been increasing year by year is that they have grasped this problem and promoted early ripening of cotton in all aspects.

    If you want cotton to ripen early, you must plant it appropriately early. Everyone knows this principle. However, planting too early is not good either, as it is easy to be harmed by "late frost," resulting in a shortage of seedlings. The appropriate early planting time should be determined according to the local climate. It is best to sow after the late frost period has passed and the temperature is suitable for seedling development. According to the climate in southern Shanxi, Qu Yaoli's experimental results show that sowing about ten days before the "Grain Rain" solar term is most suitable. This can be harvested about ten days earlier than planting during the Grain Rain solar term in the past, and "post-frost flowers" will not exceed 10 percent.

    Implementing reasonable close planting can increase production and promote early ripening. According to years of practice, cotton fields throughout the province have adopted a method of steadily increasing the number of plants. The Quzhuangtou Agricultural Cooperative led by Qu Yaoli planted an average of 3,500 cotton plants per mu in 1953 and increased it to about 4,000 plants in 1954. The cotton yield also increased from 209 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1953 to 226 jin, and there were fewer post-frost flowers.

    Strengthening the management of cotton seedlings is also a way to promote early ripening. In 1954, cotton farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province especially strengthened the management of cotton seedlings. When thinning seedlings, many places implemented the method of thinning seedlings on the ground with baskets. They put the thinned diseased plants in baskets, took them out of the field, and buried them in pits to prevent the spread of diseases and insect pests to good seedlings. When setting seedlings, hoe once along the ridge, and then use a cultivating plow to cultivate along the ridge back (about three inches deep). After such hoeing and cultivation, the purpose of cultivating soil and protecting seedlings is achieved, which is conducive to the rooting of seedlings, eliminates weeds, and of course promotes the development of seedlings.

    Implement "Five Prunings." These five prunings are pruning leaf buds, pruning strong buds, pruning the main top, pruning side tops, and pruning large leaves. Before the promotion of Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, some places did not do "five prunings," but "three prunings" or "two prunings," or even just pruning the main top. If leaf buds (also called "removing pants"), strong buds (rogues—that is, branches that do not bear bolls), and side tops are not pruned, the nutrients will all be absorbed by them and not sent to the cotton bolls. How can we promote early ripening of cotton bolls?

    July is the season when cotton grows luxuriantly. At this time, cotton begins to bloom and form bolls. Strengthening field management during this period and carrying out late-stage cultivation are of special importance to a bumper cotton harvest. The objects and frequency of cultivation should vary according to the fertility of the land and the growth of cotton. In Shanxi, July is the rainy season, so special attention should be paid to cultivating waterlogged and fertile land to remove excess moisture, increase soil temperature, and promote cotton growth and early ripening. Cotton fields with signs of "rampant growth" should also pay attention to cultivation. During cultivation, it is best to carry out twice. The first time is farther away from the cotton roots, and the second time is closer to the cotton roots. Cultivating in this way can not only prevent boll shedding, but also cut off some of the capillary roots to prevent rampant growth and promote early ripening.

    III. Appropriate Watering and Fertilization Ensure Normal Growth and More Fruiting of Cotton Plants

    Some people think that "more manure and frequent watering" can make crops grow well. In fact, this statement is wrong.

    According to the climate and soil conditions in Shanxi, many places do not water when sowing, but use moisture conservation methods. This is because the well water is cold at that time, and if well water is used for watering, it will lower the soil temperature and affect the germination of cotton seeds; at the same time, because cotton fields with alkaline soil are prone to alkalinity if watered early, it is not easy to catch seedlings. After the cotton buds emerge, watering is generally not done during the seedling stage. Watering at this time will cause the plants to grow quickly, the nodes to be long, and the development of flower buds to be slow and the ripening to be late. The Quzhuangtou Agricultural Cooperative led by Qu Yaoli started watering when the cotton first showed buds. At this time, the cotton plants are growing vigorously and the water demand is gradually increasing. Appropriate irrigation with small amounts of water can ensure the growth and fruiting of cotton seedlings. When the cotton is in full bloom, the temperature is high, the cotton plants are growing most vigorously, and the evaporation is large, so the amount of water should be increased to ensure good nutrition for the cotton plants. After boll formation, it is the boll development period, so watering should also be done appropriately to ensure more boll formation and long fibers. In 1954, the Qu Yaoli Cooperative watered a total of four times before the rainy season, and changed the small ridge watering to ditch watering in watering technology—generally one ridge and one ditch. In case of rain or to prevent rain after watering, sometimes the method of seepage irrigation on alternate ridges is also adopted. Because they keep the soil at a certain moisture content at all times and improve the watering technology, the cotton has achieved normal growth and development.

    Fertilization, like watering, is not good if it is too much. The Quzhuangtou Agricultural Cooperative led by Qu Yaoli did not apply unlimited amounts of fertilizer, but fertilized according to the fertility of the land and the growth of cotton. Waterlogged and sticky soil are more fertile, so apply less fertilizer; dry and thin soil should be applied more. Alkaline and sticky soil should be applied with more organic compost and manure. If the cotton plants are yellow-green when fertilizing, it means that they lack nitrogen fertilizer, so apply some quick-acting sulfur ammonia (fertilizer powder) to promote the growth of cotton plants; if the cotton plants are dark green and growing vigorously, apply some phosphate fertilizer to promote flowering and fruiting. They also learned the advanced Soviet fertilization experience. In addition to applying 20 jin of granular phosphate fertilizer per mu in the base fertilizer for some cotton fields, they also applied 10 jin of granular phosphate fertilizer per mu as topdressing, and also applied foliar fertilizer twice during the initial flowering and peak period—each time using 3 jin of superphosphate, diluted with 40 jin of water per jin, stirred evenly and clarified, and sprayed on the leaves with a sprayer. Foliar fertilization does not cost much money or effort, but it is very beneficial to the growth of cotton. Each cotton plant that has been foliar-fertilized can grow one or two more cotton bolls; the boll weight increases by one and a half points, and the yield per mu can increase by 7.5 percent, and the boll opening can be advanced by three to five days.

    IV. Selecting Superior Varieties to Improve Cotton Quality

    "Strong mother, fat son." For growing crops, the quality of seeds has a great relationship with the harvest. In 1954, 3.91 million mu of cotton fields in Shanxi Province, accounting for more than 92 percent of the total cotton field area of 4.24 million mu, were sown with superior cotton varieties such as "Si Zi No. 4" and "517." This proportion will be further increased this year.

    In addition to planned exchanges with other places, Shanxi Province mainly calls on and leads farmers to select and save seeds themselves to solve the variety problem. Qu Yaoli has been selecting cotton seeds for twelve years. After Qu Yaoli obtained Si Zi cotton seeds in 1942, he began to pay attention to selecting and saving the middle-part bolls, ginning and storing them separately as seeds. After liberation, with the help of the people's government, he further improved the seed selection technology. After the mutual aid group was organized in 1951, they began to implement grain selection before sowing. In 1953, they implemented the cotton directional selection method—that is, selecting the first and second cotton bolls on the third to fifth fruiting branches as seeds. When implementing the directional selection method in 1954, special attention was paid to the selection of plants. Due to continuous seed selection, the quality of the varieties has been greatly improved. The purity of their seeds has reached more than 99 percent, and 3,500 grains are enough for one jin (generally about 4,000 grains), and the five-petal cotton bolls account for 70 to 80 percent. With the same soil, the same fertilizer and cultivation techniques, only due to continuous seed selection, the yield per mu has increased by about three jin of seed cotton, the fiber is two to three mm longer than when seeds were not selected, and insect pests have been greatly reduced. Cotton stiff petals only account for 3 to 5 percent, which is 3 percent less than in the past.

    In addition to the experience in cultivation techniques and seed selection mentioned above, in order to ensure increased cotton production, it is also necessary to fight against natural disasters. In 1954, Shanxi Province, like many regions in the country, suffered from heavy rains unseen in a century, but because the Party and the government led farmers to actively prevent floods and drain water, they still achieved a bumper cotton harvest.

    This is the experience of Shanxi Province's cotton production increasing year by year. This experience is not mysterious or difficult to learn; as long as it is well publicized to farmers and farmers are organized and led to proceed from the specific conditions of their local areas, they can learn it, and the cotton yield can also increase year by year like in Shanxi Province.

    怎样提高棉花产量
    田流  郭石
    一、山西省的棉花产量年年提高
    一九五四年，我国棉花的单位面积产量，是每亩还不足三十斤皮棉。如果，这产量再提高些，例如每亩产四十五斤皮棉，该多好啊！那样，就可以在一九五四年的产量基础上，增产百分之五十，那就是一千多万担皮棉。那么，不扩大棉田面积，也能够满足现有纺织工业的需要，全国人民得到的布匹和其他棉织物，也就穿不完，用不完了。
    棉花单位面积产量提高一半——这可不是空想。山西省已经成为事实了。一九五四年，山西全省四百二十四万亩棉田的单位面积产量，已经达到每亩四十六点二八斤皮棉。山西省的棉花，不光产量高，质量也很好：衣分率高、纤维长、色泽也好。一百斤籽棉一般能出三十三、四斤皮棉，纤维长度一般是二十四公厘。最好的棉花，一百斤籽棉出三十六点七斤皮棉，纤维长达二十八公厘以上。纤维长、色泽好，能纺出高级纱，能织出很好的布，人民就可以穿上更漂亮的衣裳。
    山西省棉花的产量为什么这样高？质量为什么这样好？是因为那里的土壤、气候特别优越，特别适合棉花作物的生长么？不是。那么是什么原因呢？主要是依靠着改进植棉技术。这技术也不是什么神妙的高深的技术。这技术是一个名叫曲耀离的农民创造出来的。只要有人把他的植棉经验准确地告诉农民，农民一听就会；而且实行起来化钱不多，费力不大。
    二、减少霜后花是提高棉花产量质量的重要环节
    产棉区的农民，秋后拔棉柴时，常常惋惜地说：“棉秸上还有不少桃呢，要是都开了，该多摘多少花啊！”这是真的，如果一棵棉花上有一个棉桃未开，按一亩地有三千棵棉花计算（山西省已密植到三千五到四千棵），就有三千个桃未开成花。以一百朵花摘一斤，就少收三十斤。
    产棉区的农民，在收摘末喷花时，也常常惋惜地说：“一经霜，棉花就开不好了，尽僵瓣。”这也是真的，“霜后花”僵瓣多，色泽不好，衣分率低，纤维也短，份量也轻；一斤好花要是值三角钱，“霜后花”只能值一角钱。
    因此，怎样促进棉花早熟，怎样减少“霜后花”，叫棉桃在下霜以前就开放，就成为提高棉花产量质量的一个很重要的事情了。山西省棉花产量年年提高，就是他们抓住了这个问题，从各方面去促进棉花早熟。
    要想棉花熟的早，就要适当早种，这道理是谁都知道的。但是，种的太早了也不行，容易受“晚霜”的害，造成缺苗。适宜的早种时间要根据本地的气候来决定。最好是在晚霜期已经过去，气温已经适宜幼苗发育的时候下种。根据晋南地区的气候，曲耀离试验的结果，是在“谷雨节”前十天左右播种最合适。这可以比过去在谷雨节播种的早收十天左右，“霜后花”不会超过百分之十。
    实行合理密植，能够提高产量促进早熟。根据历年来的实践，全省棉田采取了稳步增加株数的方法。曲耀离领导的曲庄头农业社，一九五三年每亩植棉平均三千五百株，一九五四年增加到四千株左右，棉花的产量也由一九五三年的每亩产籽棉二百零九斤，提高到二百二十六斤，霜后花也少。
    加强对棉花幼苗的管理，也是促进早熟的一个办法。一九五四年山西省各地棉农特别加强了棉田幼苗管理工作，间苗时很多地方实行了提篮上地间苗法，他们把间下来的病株，放在篮子里，提出地外边，刨坑埋掉，免得使好苗受到病、虫害的传播。定苗时先顺着垄间锄一次，再用耩犁顺垄背中耕一次（约三寸深），经过这样的一锄一耕，就达到了培土护苗的目的，既利于幼苗扎根，又能消灭杂草，当然也就促进小苗发育了。
    实行“五打整枝”。这五打便是打叶芽、打强芽、打正顶、打旁顶、打大叶。在没有推广曲耀离的植棉经验以前，有些地方不是“五打”，而是“三打”、“两打”，甚至光打一下正顶就算了。不打叶芽（也叫脱裤子）、不打强芽（莠条——即不结桃的枝）、不打旁顶等，养分全被它们吸收了，送不到棉桃上去，怎么能促进棉桃早熟呢？
    七月，是棉花繁茂生长的季节，这时候棉花开始开花、结铃，加强这段时间的田间管理，进行后期中耕，对棉花丰收，是有特殊重要作用的。中耕的对象和次数，应根据土地的肥瘠和棉花生长的情况而有所不同。在山西七月是雨季，要特别注意对水地、肥地进行中耕，以排除过多的水份，增加地温，促进棉花生长和早熟。有“狂长”象征的棉田也要注意中耕。中耕时，最好分两次进行，第一次距棉根较远，第二次距棉根较近。用这种方法中耕，不仅可以防止落铃，而且能够切断一部分毛根防止狂长，促进早熟。
    三、适当浇水施肥保证棉株正常生长和多结实
    有人认为“粪大水勤”就能使庄稼长得好，其实这种说法是错误的。
    根据山西的气候、土壤条件，很多地方在播种时不浇水，而采用保墒的办法。这是因为那时井水凉，如用井水浇，便会降低地温，影响棉籽发芽；同时因为带碱性土质的棉田，早浇反碱不易捉住苗。棉芽出土后，幼苗期一般也不浇水，这时如浇水会造成植株长的快、节间长和蕾铃发育慢、成熟晚的恶果。曲耀离领导的曲庄头农业社是在棉花初现蕾时开始浇水，这时棉株生育渐盛，需要水分逐渐增多，采用小水轻浇的方法适当灌溉就能保证棉苗生长、结实。当棉花盛开时，气温高，棉株生长最旺，蒸发量大，需水更多，就要增加些水量，保证棉株营养良好。结铃后，正是棉铃发育时期，也要适当地进行浇水，以保证多结铃、纤维长。一九五四年，曲耀离社在雨季以前共浇水四次，在浇水技术上改小畦浇为沟浇——一般是一垄一沟，遇雨或防止浇后遇雨，有时也采取隔垄渗浇的办法。因为他们使土壤经常保持一定的水分，又改进了浇水技术，就使棉花得到了正常的生长和发育。
    施肥和浇水一样，并不是多了就好。曲耀离领导的曲庄头农业社并不是无限量的多施肥，而是根据土地的肥瘠和棉花生长的状况施肥的。水地和粘土地土质较肥，就少施点，旱地薄地就多施些。碱土地和粘土地多施有机质的堆肥和圈肥。施肥时如果棉株呈现黄绿色，那就是缺少氮肥，就施些速效的硫?（肥田粉），促进棉株生长；如果棉株呈现深绿色，生长旺盛，就施些磷肥，促进开花结实。他们还学习了苏联的先进施肥经验，除部分棉田在底肥内每亩施用颗粒状磷肥二十斤外，追肥每亩再施颗粒状磷肥十斤，在初花和盛期还作了两次根外施肥——每次用过磷酸?三斤，每斤兑水四十斤，搅匀澄清后，用喷雾器喷在叶子上。根外施肥化钱不多，费劲不大，但对棉花的生长很有好处。施过根外追肥的每棵棉株可多长一个到两个棉铃；铃重增加一分半，每亩可增加百分之七点五的产量，吐絮能提前三天到五天。
    四、选育优种改进棉花品质
    “母壮儿肥”，种庄稼，种子好坏，对收获是有很大关系的。一九五四年山西全省四百二十四万亩棉田，有三百九十一万亩即占百分之九十二以上的棉田面积，播种了“斯字四号”、“五一七”等优良棉种，今年这个比例还要提高。
    山西省解决品种问题除有计划地同外地调换外，主要是号召和领导农民自己选种留种。曲耀离进行棉花选种已有十二年的历史了。从一九四二年曲耀离得到了斯字棉种后，他就开始注意选留腰花，另轧、另放留作种子。解放后，在人民政府帮助下，他又进一步改进了选种技术。一九五一年组织了互助组以后，他们开始实行了播种前的粒选，一九五三年又实行棉花定向选种法——即在第三到第五个果枝上选取第一和第二个棉桃作种，一九五四年贯彻定向选种法时，又特别注意了选株工作。由于连续选种，品种的质量大大提高，他们的种子的纯度达到了百分之九十九以上，每三千五百粒就够一斤重（一般是四千粒左右），五瓣的棉铃占百分之七十到八十。同样的土质，同样的肥料和栽培技术，只是由于连续选种，产量每亩就增加了三斤左右的籽棉，纤维比不选种时增长二到三公厘，虫害大大减少，棉花僵瓣只占百分之三到百分之五，比过去减少了百分之三。
    除了前面说过的在栽培技术和选种等方面的经验以外，要保证棉花增产，还必须同自然灾害进行斗争。一九五四年，山西省和全国许多地区一样遭受了百年来未有的大雨，但是因为党和政府领导农民积极防洪排水，仍然获得了棉花丰收。
  这就是山西省棉花产量年年提高的经验，这经验并不神妙，也不难学；只要好好的向农民宣传，并组织和领导农民从本地的具体情况出发，就能够学会，就能够使棉花的产量也和山西省一样一年比一年提高。
