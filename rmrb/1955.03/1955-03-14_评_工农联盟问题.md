Review of "The Problem of the Worker-Peasant Alliance"

    Written by Wu Jiang, published by People's Publishing House

    The worker-peasant alliance is an important issue during China's transition period. The book "The Problem of the Worker-Peasant Alliance" provides a relatively systematic and accessible exposition of this issue, which is helpful for the majority of cadres.

    The book is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter, "The Worker-Peasant Alliance Under the Leadership of the Working Class," the author first elaborates on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding the worker-peasant alliance. The idea of the worker-peasant alliance was first proposed by Marx and Engels when analyzing the revolutionary movements in Germany, France, and other European countries in the 19th century, and was later developed by Lenin and Stalin. The experience of the Soviet revolution proves that the worker-peasant alliance has always been the most fundamental social force in the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and communist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong specifically applied the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of the worker-peasant alliance in the long course of the Chinese revolution. The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of China's people's democratic dictatorship and is the basic force for winning the victory of the people's revolution, building socialism, and completing socialist transformation. The author explains that workers and peasants are two classes with different economic positions, but their common interests always occupy a major position in the various periods of the revolution, so it is always possible to form an alliance. The author emphasizes the leading role of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance, because the working class is the most revolutionary class, and industry always leads agriculture forward. Historical experience proves that peasants cannot be emancipated without the leadership of the working class.

    In the second and third chapters, the author focuses on combining with China's reality, elaborating on the importance of the worker-peasant alliance in the two periods of China's new democratic revolution and socialist revolution.

    In the period of the new democratic revolution, because the peasants were the working class's most important ally, solving the peasant problem became the central issue for the working class to realize its revolutionary leadership. The author analyzes this from two aspects: First, old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, and the peasant class, as the main mass of our country, was not only oppressed by the landlord class, but also by imperialism, so the peasants were the main force against imperialism and feudalism; Second, the revolution led by the Chinese working class must have a people's democratic united front including all classes that can cooperate, and the worker-peasant alliance happens to be the foundation of this united front. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, represented by the working class, China's worker-peasant alliance has experienced three domestic revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan, finally enabling China's new democratic revolution to achieve a comprehensive victory. The author, from elaborating on the path experienced by China's worker-peasant alliance, concludes that China's worker-peasant alliance has at least the following five characteristics: (1) The weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie makes them dare not mobilize the peasants to rise up against the feudal forces, and only the Chinese working class and its party—the Communist Party of China—who earnestly fight for the interests of the peasants can become the sole leader of the Chinese peasants. (2) The characteristics of the Chinese revolution, which first occupied the countryside, surrounded the cities from the countryside, and finally seized the cities, made the working class and the peasants not only have very rich experience in political cooperation, but also have considerable experience in economic cooperation—mainly experience in organizing and developing production in agriculture. This situation cannot but help the cause of economic cooperation between workers and peasants in future national construction. (3) The road of China's worker-peasant alliance has been traversed in the alliance of the working class and the peasants and in cooperation with the national bourgeoisie. On the one hand, the importance of these two alliances with different natures must be distinguished, and on the other hand, one must not only attach importance to the worker-peasant alliance and not value the alliance with the national bourgeoisie. (4) Unlike the Russian revolution, according to China's situation, there has never been and will never be a policy of neutral middle peasants in our country, and a solid alliance policy must be implemented with all middle peasants throughout the entire period. (5) Unlike the Russian revolution, according to China's situation, the land policy of the new democratic revolution is not to implement land nationalization, but only to change the feudal land ownership system into the peasants' land ownership system. The private ownership of land by Chinese peasants will be gradually transformed into a collective ownership system of a socialist nature through the road of collectivization.

    With the establishment of the People's Republic of China, China began a new historical period of socialist revolution, which also began a new period of worker-peasant alliance. The author points out that the so-called new period of worker-peasant alliance, on the one hand, refers to the fact that the historical conditions of the worker-peasant alliance have changed, and the contradiction between capitalism and socialism has replaced the contradiction between feudalism and democracy, becoming the main contradiction in the countryside; on the other hand, it refers to the historical tasks shouldered by the worker-peasant alliance have changed. The past worker-peasant alliance was the working class leading the peasants to fight to overthrow the three major enemies, and today's worker-peasant alliance is to fight to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and to transition to a socialist society. There is a deep dialectical relationship between consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and realizing the general task of the country during the transition period—realizing the general task must rely on the strength of the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance must move forward along the general task at all times.

    The author used a lot of space to give a more comprehensive elaboration of the party's various basic policies for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Regarding the significance of national industrialization to the worker-peasant alliance, the author explained three issues: (1) National socialist industrialization is the highest interest of peasants and agriculture, because socialist industrialization aims at maximizing the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the working people, and its development is based on the combination of industrial and agricultural interests. (2) Heavy industry and light industry have different roles in the worker-peasant alliance. It is not enough to rely solely on light industry to establish ties with agriculture, because it only involves the peasants' lives. Only when heavy industry is linked to the peasants' production can it help the high development of agricultural production. Therefore, China's industrialization, the policy of focusing on the development of heavy industry, is also completely in line with the fundamental interests of the peasants. (3) Gradually reducing the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural product prices is one of the important policies of China's industrialization. Regarding the significance of the socialist transformation of agriculture to the worker-peasant alliance, the author emphasized that the socialist transformation of agriculture is another decisive link in further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. And developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement is a form of transforming agriculture and conducive to consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The Party's policy in the countryside is a guarantee for completing the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    Another advantage of this book is that the author pays attention to criticizing the erroneous views or confused ideas of cadres or the masses on the issue of the worker-peasant alliance when elaborating on various issues. When explaining the leading role of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance, the author criticized the "theory" of "peasants leading the revolution" and the spontaneous theory that peasants are born with the desire to organize; when explaining the new conditions and new tasks of the worker-peasant alliance during the transition period, the author criticized the "once and for all" theory—being satisfied with the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance in the past, while ignoring the necessity of continuing to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance in the new period; when explaining the significance of realizing the general task of the transition period to the worker-peasant alliance, the author criticized the argument that ignores the decisive role of developing industry, especially developing heavy industry, in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, criticized the idea that it is possible to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country, a small peasant economy like a vast ocean, and criticized the idea of advocating letting peasants freely trade.

    In addition, there are still some shortcomings in this book.

    First of all, this book does not fully clarify the historical role of the worker-peasant alliance during the transition period. The author emphasizes that the worker-peasant alliance is the basic force for China's socialist economic construction, which is correct and necessary, but in addition to this, it has not been deeply elaborated that the worker-peasant alliance is also the basic force for China's political power construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction. Secondly, there are also shortcomings in the analysis of the characteristics of China's worker-peasant alliance. The author emphasizes that the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie determines that it cannot lead the peasants, which is correct, but it does not mean that the bourgeoisie does not attempt to deceive the peasants into leaving the revolution, so it is necessary to fight against this unfavorable action of the bourgeoisie. The author did not appropriately point out this aspect. Again, the author correctly pointed out that China and the Soviet Union adopted different solutions to the issue of land ownership after the victory of the revolution, but there is a lack of necessary specific analysis of why the Soviet Union must and can realize land nationalization, and why China does not adopt this method, so the persuasiveness of this argument is not enough. Finally, the author did not mention the significance of cultural and educational work to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, which is also a shortcoming. Lenin once regarded cultural work among the peasants as a major task of epoch-making significance facing socialist countries. He said: "Without a whole cultural revolution, complete cooperation is impossible." ("On Cooperation") When Stalin talked about the policy of the Communist Party to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, he also pointed out that it must be started from three aspects: economic, administrative, political, and cultural education ("Questions and Answers").

    In general, the advantages of this book are basic and major, and it is helpful for the majority of cadres to correctly understand the issue of the worker-peasant alliance.

    评“工农联盟问题”
    朱榕
    吴江著  人民出版社出版
    工农联盟是我国过渡时期一个重要问题。“工农联盟问题”一书对这问题作了比较系统而通俗的阐述，对广大干部有一定的帮助。
    全书共分三章，在第一章“工人阶级领导下的工农联盟”中，作者首先阐述了马克思列宁主义关于工农联盟的基本原理。工农联盟思想最先是马克思、恩格斯在分析十九世纪欧洲德、法等国革命运动时提出的，后来为列宁、斯大林所发展了。苏联革命的经验证明，工农联盟在民主革命、社会主义革命、社会主义建设、共产主义建设中始终都是最基本的社会力量。毛泽东同志在中国革命的长期过程中具体运用了马克思列宁主义关于工农联盟的学说。工农联盟是我国人民民主专政的基础，是取得人民革命胜利和建设社会主义及完成社会主义改造的基本力量。作者说明了工农是两个具有不同经济地位的阶级，但是在革命各个时期他们之间共同的利益总是占主要地位，因此始终可能结成联盟。作者强调指出工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导作用，因为工人阶级是最革命的阶级，工业总是带领农业前进。历史经验证明，农民如果没有工人阶级的领导是不可能得到翻身的。
    在第二章、第三章中作者着重结合我国实际，阐述了工农联盟在中国新民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个时期中的重要意义。
    在新民主主义革命时期，由于农民是工人阶级的最主要的同盟军，所以解决农民问题就成为工人阶级实现自己革命领导权的中心问题。作者从两方面来分析这一点：第一、旧中国是一个半殖民地半封建的国家，作为我国主要群众的农民阶级，不仅受地主阶级压迫，而且受帝国主义压迫，因此农民是反帝反封建的主力军；第二、中国工人阶级领导的革命，必须有一个包括一切可能合作的阶级的人民民主统一战线，而工农联盟恰好就是这个统一战线的基础。在以中国共产党为代表的工人阶级领导下，我国工农联盟曾经历了三次国内革命战争和抗日战争，终于使我国新民主主义革命取得了全面胜利。作者从阐述我国工农联盟所经历的道路，归结到我国工农联盟至少具有以下五个特点：（一）中国资产阶级的软弱性使他们不敢发动农民起来反对封建势力，而只有认真为农民利益奋斗的中国工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党才能成为中国农民唯一的领导者。（二）中国革命以先占领乡村、以乡村包围城市、最后夺取城市的特点，使得工人阶级与农民不仅有十分丰富的政治合作的经验，也有相当丰富的经济合作的经验——主要是在农业方面组织起来发展生产的经验。这种情况不能不有助于今后国家建设中工农经济合作的事业。（三）我国工农联盟的道路，是在工人阶级和农民联盟而又和民族资产阶级进行合作中走过的，对这两种不同性质的联盟，一方面不能不分别轻重，另一方面又不能只重视工农联盟，而不重视和民族资产阶级联盟。（四）和俄国革命时不同，根据我国情况，在我国始终没有也不会有中立中农的政策，而必须和全部中农在整个时期内实行巩固联盟的政策。（五）和俄国革命时不同，根据我国情况，新民主主义革命的土地政策不是实行土地国有化，而只是将封建的土地所有制改变为农民的土地所有制。我国农民的土地私有制将经过合作化的道路逐步改变为社会主义性质的集体所有制。
    随着中华人民共和国的建立，我国开始了社会主义革命的新的历史时期，也就开始了工农联盟的新时期。作者指出：所谓工农联盟的新时期，一方面是指工农联盟的历史条件改变了，资本主义和社会主义的矛盾已代替了封建主义和民主主义的矛盾，而成为农村中的主要矛盾；另一方面是指工农联盟所肩负的历史任务改变了。过去的工农联盟是工人阶级领导农民为推翻三大敌人而斗争，今天的工农联盟则是为巩固人民民主专政、为过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。巩固工农联盟与实现国家过渡时期的总任务之间有着深刻的辩证关系——实现总任务必须依靠工农联盟的力量，巩固工农联盟又必须每时每刻都沿着总任务前进。
    作者用了较多的篇幅对于党进一步巩固工农联盟的各项基本政策作了较全面的阐述。关于国家工业化对于工农联盟的意义，作者说明了三个问题：（一）国家社会主义工业化是农民和农业的最高利益，因为社会主义工业化是以最大限度地满足劳动群众的物质与文化需要为目的，它的发展是以工业和农业利益的结合为基础。（二）重工业和轻工业在工农联盟中有着不同的作用，仅仅依靠轻工业去和农业建立联系是不够的，因为它只涉及到农民的生活方面。只有重工业和农民的生产联系起来才能帮助农业生产的高度发展。所以我国工业化，以发展重工业为重心的政策，也是完全符合农民的根本利益的。（三）逐步缩小工农业品价格之间的剪刀差是我国工业化的重要政策之一。关于农业的社会主义改造对于工农联盟的意义，作者强调指出对农业的社会主义改造，是进一步巩固工农联盟的另一决定性的环节。而发展互助合作运动就是改造农业并有利于巩固工农联盟的形式。党在农村中的政策，是完成农业的社会主义改造的保证。
    本书的另一优点就是，作者在阐述各个问题时都注意到批判干部或群众中有关工农联盟问题的错误看法或糊涂观念。在说明工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导作用时，作者批判了“农民领导革命”的
  “理论”和农民天生具有组织起来要求的自流论；在说明过渡时期工农联盟的新条件、新任务时，作者批判了“一劳永逸”论——满足于过去工农联盟的巩固，而忽略了在新时期继续巩固工农联盟的必要性；在说明实现过渡时期总任务对于工农联盟的意义时，作者批判了忽视发展工业、尤其是发展重工业在巩固工农联盟中最具决定性作用的论调，批判了怀疑在我们这样一个小农经济如汪洋大海的国家里有可能实现农业的社会主义改造的思想，批判了主张放任农民自由买卖的思想。
    另外，本书也还存在着一些缺点。
    首先，本书对于工农联盟在过渡时期的历史作用阐明得不够全面。作者着重说明了工农联盟是我国社会主义经济建设的基本力量，这是正确的、必要的，但除此以外，对工农联盟也是我国政权建设、国防建设、文化建设的基本力量这一点还未加以深入阐述。其次，关于我国工农联盟的特点的分析也有缺点。作者强调我国资产阶级的软弱性决定了它不能领导农民，这是正确的，但并不等于说资产阶级就不企图诱骗农民离开革命，因而必须和资产阶级的这种不利于人民的行动进行斗争。作者在这方面没有适当指出。再次，作者正确地指出了我国与苏联革命胜利后在土地所有制问题上是采取了不同的解决办法，但是对于苏联为什么必须而且可能实现土地国有，而我国为什么不采取这种办法，缺乏应有的具体分析，因此这一论点的说服力是不够的。最后，作者没有讲到文化教育工作对于巩固工农联盟的意义，这也是一个缺点。列宁曾把农民中的文化工作看作摆在社会主义国家面前的一个划时代的主要任务，他说：“如果没有整个的文化革命，那末，完全合作化便是不可能实现的。”（“论合作制”）斯大林在讲到共产党巩固工农联盟的政策时也指出，必须从经济、行政政治和文化教育三方面着手（“问题与答复”）。
    总的说来，本书的优点是基本的、主要的，对于广大干部正确地认识工农联盟问题是有帮助的。
