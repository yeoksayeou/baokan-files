Make Full Use of Oak Trees to Raise Oak Silkworms
　　Fang Kun
　　Oak silkworm is a famous specialty of our country, and its producing areas are distributed in Liaoning, Henan, Shandong, Guizhou and other places. In addition to meeting domestic needs, oak silk is also exported in large quantities to foreign countries. In 1954 alone, the value of exported products from various factories under the Liaoning Provincial Oak Silk Company was equivalent to more than 28,500 tons of steel.
　　Judging from the situation in some areas, oak silkworm production has developed to a certain extent, but this development is relatively slow. Many mountainous areas have dense oak forests, but only a small part of them are currently used for raising silkworms. For example, Henan Province currently has 4 million mu of oak forests, but only a quarter of them have been used for raising oak silkworms. Other provinces have similar situations.
　　Judging from the fact that oak trees, the feed for oak silkworms, grow in mountainous areas, do not occupy farmland, and the time required for raising silkworms is not very long, the impact on agricultural production is small, this production has great prospects for development.
　　The mutual aid and cooperation movement in various regions has greatly developed this year. This is a favorable condition for the development of oak silkworm production; oak silkworm production has also added a new production content for agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous areas. Areas with prospects for developing oak silkworm production should attach importance to this production.

    充分利用柞树饲育柞蚕
    方堃
    柞蚕是我国著名的特产，产区分布在辽宁、河南、山东、贵州等地。柞蚕丝绸除了供应国内需要以外，还有很大数量输往国外，仅辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司所属各厂一九五四年输出产品的价值就相当于二万八千五百多吨钢材的价值。
    从一些地区的情况看，柞蚕生产已有一定程度的发展，但是这种发展的速度是比较缓慢的。许多山区都有茂密的柞树林，而现在已利用养蚕的只不过其中一小部分。如河南省现有的柞树林有四百万亩，曾经放养过柞蚕的只有四分之一。其他各省也有这样的情况。
    从柞蚕饲料柞树生长在山岭地区，不占用农田，放蚕所需时间不很长，对农业生产影响不大等方面来看，这项生产是有很大发展前途的。
    各地互助合作运动今年都有很大发展。这对发展柞蚕生产是一个有利条件；柞蚕生产也为山区农业生产合作社增添了一项新的生产内容。有发展柞蚕生产前途的地区应该重视起这项生产来。
