Before the Dai New Year "Jing Bi Mai" (April 14th), more than 8,000 farm households in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province will move into new homes.

Now, every early morning, on the Lancang River and Liusha River shrouded in mist, rafts of timber and bamboo float downstream to villages in the dam area and mountainous areas along the banks. Everywhere, one can see farmers carrying grass thatch (for roofing) and transporting bamboo and timber.

The autonomous region has had bumper harvests of grain, cotton, and tea for consecutive years, and the living standards of people of all ethnic groups have gradually improved. In 90 villages, large and small, in Jinghong, Menghai, and other ten "banners" (administrative divisions) and the Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region, an average village of twenty or thirty households has five or six households building new houses. In the fourteen villages inhabited by the Bulang, Hani, and Lahu people in the mountainous areas, 140 families have already built new houses. Farmers from Dashang Village and Xiazhai, who fled to the deep mountains during the Kuomintang rule, have also built new houses this year.

Now, many new houses have been completed. The Dai farmers in the dam area mostly use bamboo fences to enclose their courtyards. Farmers in villages such as Manbang have also planted trees, bananas, and plantains, and cultivated coconut trees next to their new homes. According to Dai custom, whenever a new house is completed, the owner invites neighbors and relatives who helped build the house to participate in "Qie Hen Mai" (celebrating the new house), singing and playing music, with some celebrations lasting all night.

    西双版纳八千户农家盖新屋
    在傣历新年“京比迈”（四月十四日）以前，云南省西双版纳傣族自治区将有八千户以上的农家要迁入新居。
    现在，每当清早，在朝雾弥漫的澜沧江和流沙河上，有着扎成筏子的木材和竹子顺流漂向沿岸的坝区和山区的村寨里，到处可以看到挑草排（盖屋顶用）运送竹子和木材的农民。
    自治区连年粮食、棉花、茶叶丰收，各族人民的生活逐渐富裕，在景洪、勐海等十个版纳及格朗和哈尼族自治区的九十个大小村寨里，平均一个二三十户的村寨，就有五、六户盖新房。在山区居住的布朗人、哈尼人和拉祜人的十四个村寨里，已经盖好新屋的有一百四十家，在国民党统治时期逃往深山去的大山上寨、下寨的农民们今年也盖了新房。
    现在，许多新房已经落成。坝区的傣族农家，大都用竹篱圈成院落。曼蚌等村寨的农家，还在新居旁边种植了树木、香蕉、芭蕉，培育了椰子树。按照傣族的习惯，每当新居落成，主人都邀请了帮助自己盖房的村邻和亲友来参加“怯很迈”（庆贺新房），唱歌奏乐，有的欢乐通宵。
