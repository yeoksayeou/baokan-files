The story of Song Qingru purchasing government bonds
Song Qingru, a language teacher at Hangzhou Commercial School, recently subscribed to 12,000 yuan of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. This money was the remuneration from the Writers Publishing House for her husband, Mr. Zhu Shenghao's, translation of Shakespeare's collected plays. On the afternoon of the 9th, when the reporter interviewed her, she modestly said, "I am just reinvesting the fruits of Zhu Shenghao's lifelong hard work into the construction of the motherland."

Song Qingru's husband, Zhu Shenghao, was a translator. Before the Anti-Japanese War, when Zhu Shenghao was working at the former "World Book Company," he took time to translate the complete works of Shakespeare. At that time, the contract he signed with the "World Book Company" stipulated that he would receive two yuan for every thousand words translated. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the puppet currency depreciated, and the royalties earned from translating one thousand words were often not enough to buy a liter of rice. At that time, Zhu Shenghao was in poor health, but he still worked despite his illness, and persisted in translating thirty-one plays. In 1944, Zhu Shenghao died of poverty and hard work at the young age of thirty-two. The following year, Zhu Shenghao's translated collection of Shakespearean plays was published, but the crystallization of many years of hard work only earned him a small amount of royalties. Once, the royalties he received were only enough to buy three dou of rice. In 1954, the Writers Publishing House re-edited and published Zhu Shenghao's translated collection of Shakespearean plays, and also included the four plays that the "World Book Company" had not published. In 1954, the Writers Publishing House sent Song Qingru a very large sum of royalties. When Song Qingru received this sum of royalties, she was moved with mixed feelings of sadness and joy. At that time, she used 50 million old RMB to buy books and broadcasting equipment and donated them to the middle schools and cultural departments in Zhu Shenghao's hometown—Jiaxing City. Recently, she used another 12,000 yuan to purchase national economic construction bonds.

Song Qingru's health is also very poor. In 1953, when she was teaching at Hangzhou Normal School, she suffered from severe complications of intestinal ulcers, stomach ulcers, and gallbladder inflammation. However, with the care of the school leaders and colleagues, she was quickly cured. A large sum of medical expenses used in the treatment was all borne by the state, and her salary was still paid during the holidays. When Song Qingru recalled these things, she excitedly said to the reporter: "The old society took Zhu Shenghao's life, but the new society saved me from the brink of death. Now I love my life even more, and I love my motherland. In addition to purchasing government bonds to support national construction, I will work harder in the future and contribute my strength to the people."

    宋清如购买公债的故事
    新华社记者　方徨
    杭州商业学校语文教师宋清如，最近认购了一万二千元一九五五年国家经济建设公债。这笔钱是作家出版社酬劳她丈夫朱生豪先生翻译莎士比亚戏剧集的稿费。九日下午，当记者访问她时，她谦虚地说：“我这不过是把朱生豪一生辛勤劳动的果实，再投入到祖国建设事业中去。”
    宋清如的丈夫朱生豪，是个翻译家。抗日战争前，朱生豪在前“世界书局”工作时，抽空翻译莎士比亚全集，当时他和“世界书局”订的合同规定翻译一千字得稿费二元。抗日战争爆发后，伪币贬值，往往翻译一千字所得的稿费连一升米也买不到。当时朱生豪身体很不好，但他仍旧带病工作，
  一直坚持翻译了三十一个剧本。一九四四年，朱生豪只有三十二岁的时候，贫困和辛劳就夺去了他的生命。第二年，朱生豪翻译的莎士比亚戏剧集出版了，可是这多少年心血的结晶，仅换到很少一点稿费，有一次拿到的稿费只够买三斗米。一九五四年，作家出版社把朱生豪翻译的莎士比亚戏剧集重新整理出版了，并且把“世界书局”没有出版的四个剧本也编了进去。一九五四年作家出版社寄给宋清如一笔很厚的稿费。当宋清如接到这笔稿费时，感动得悲喜交集。当时就拿旧人民币五千万元买了图书和广播器材，赠送给朱生豪故乡——嘉兴市的中等学校和文化部门，最近她又拿一万二千元购买了国家经济建设公债。
    宋清如的身体也很不好，一九五三年，她在杭州师范学校教书时，就生过很厉害的肠溃疡、胃溃疡和胆囊结合的合并症，但是在学校负责人和同事们的关怀下，很快就医治好了，在医疗中用去的很大一笔医药费全部由国家负担，假期里工资还照发。宋清如回忆起这些事情时，激动地对记者说：“旧社会夺去了朱生豪的生命，新社会却使我死里逃生。我现在更热爱我的生活，热爱我的祖国。我除了购买公债支援国家建设外，今后要更好地工作，把自己的力量贡献给人民。”
