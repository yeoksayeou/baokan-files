Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps plans to plant over 120,000 mu of cotton this year, an area more than double that of last year. The average yield per unit area is required to increase by 116.2% compared to the actual yield per unit area last year.

In order to complete this year's cotton planting task, each cotton planting unit, based on past experience, has been systematically carrying out various preparatory work since last year. Most of the cotton fields have been applied with sufficient base fertilizer, and one-third of the cotton fields have been planted with green manure. Among the cotton fields, except for some that are not suitable for winter irrigation due to high water levels, most have been winter irrigated. Since the beginning of winter, various units have also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer. In terms of seeds, in addition to the original cultivated varieties, 440 tons of new varieties will be imported from the Soviet Union.

Secondly, under the guidance of Soviet expert Titov, the corps has trained a certain number of technical cadres through various means over the past few years. In winter, technical studies were widely carried out, greatly improving the corps' cotton planting technology. All these have created conditions for a bumper cotton harvest.

    新疆生产部队棉田扩大一倍
    新疆军区生产建设兵团今年计划种植棉花十二万多亩，面积比去年扩大一倍多，单位面积产量平均要求比去年实收单位面积产量提高百分之一百一十六点二。
    为完成今年植棉任务，各植棉单位根据往年经验，从去年即有计划地进行了各项准备工作，绝大部分棉田都施了足够的基肥，其中三分之一的棉田压种过绿肥。棉田中，除部分因水位高不宜冬灌外，其余大部分都进行了冬灌。入冬以来，各单位又积了大量的肥料。种子方面，除已驯化的原有品种外，并将由苏联引进新品种四百四十吨。
    其次，在苏联专家提托夫的指导下，几年来部队通过各种方式，训练了一定数量的技术干部；冬季又普遍开展了技术学习，使部队植棉技术有了很大的提高。这些都为棉花丰产创造了条件。
