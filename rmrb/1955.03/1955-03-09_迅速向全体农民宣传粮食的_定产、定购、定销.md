    Swiftly Publicize "Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, Fixed Sales" of Grain to All Farmers
    The vast number of farmers in China are beginning or preparing for spring plowing, producing large quantities of grain and other crops for the country and themselves. The vast majority of farmers understand the great significance of increasing grain production and also see that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain implemented by the state for the past two years is necessary and beneficial to the farmers and the people of the whole country. However, many farmers do not know: How much grain will the state purchase from them each year? Of the grain they produce, how much is purchased by the state and how much is at their own disposal?
    Answering this question for farmers is necessary. This is extremely important for increasing farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production. Only when farmers "know the bottom line" will they not mistakenly believe that the more they produce, the more the state purchases, and the benefits to farmers are not great enough. That is to say, the fixed amount of grain that the state purchases each year should be announced to farmers in advance during spring plowing, so that farmers can formulate their own plans to increase production based on this.
    The State Council and the Party Central Committee require that all localities across the country should, on a township basis, quickly determine the township's regular annual planned output and the township's figures for unified purchase and sale of grain, and announce them to the farmers, so that every household knows how much grain they should produce as a minimum, so that farmers with surplus grain know how much grain they only need to sell to the state, and so that farmers who lack grain know how much grain they can purchase from the state. The State Council stipulates that after the autumn harvest, as long as the year is normal, the state will purchase from farmers according to the figures announced in the spring, and no matter how much the farmers increase production, the purchase figures will no longer change. Therefore, farmers can keep more surplus grain for themselves and freely dispose of this surplus grain, and the benefits of increased production can be fully realized by the farmers. Only when certain areas within a province or the whole country suffer serious disasters, the unified purchase figures for grain in the disaster areas will inevitably be reduced, and the grain supply for farmers in the disaster areas will inevitably be increased, and farmers in bumper harvest areas will need to sell more grain to the state to help the state regulate the supply to the people in the disaster areas; however, the amount of grain purchased should not exceed 40% of the increased production of farmers in bumper harvest areas.
    The estimated unified purchase figures for grain this year have already been distributed by the central government to each province, and each province should quickly distribute them to the townships at each level. Each township should use the fastest method to communicate it to every household of farmers, so that every family has a clear understanding, makes proper arrangements for the whole year's household affairs as soon as possible, and actively invests in the spring plowing production campaign.
    Since the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the achievements have been great. Relying on this correct policy, the state has rationally regulated and supplied the needs of all aspects for grain. About 100 million residents in cities and industrial and mining areas have received adequate grain supplies. Approximately 50 million farmers in economic crop areas, 50 million farmers lacking food grain, and tens of millions of farmers who suffered from floods last year, i.e., nearly 200 million farmers, have similarly received basic guarantees of food grain in the past two years. The vast number of grain-producing areas in our country have practiced frugality, worked diligently, and enthusiastically sold grain to the state, supported the country's industrial construction, and helped farmers lacking grain to overcome difficulties, making glorious contributions to the country.
    However, because our country's grain output cannot fully meet the needs of all aspects in the short term, and because unified purchase and sale is a new task and lacks sufficient experience, it is not possible to immediately establish a detailed and thorough system. In the midst of this work, some shortcomings are unavoidable. Because the purchase figures for each township are not predetermined and announced, farmers easily feel uncertain. Farmers in some places feel that the amount of unified purchase is too large, and the amount they retain is too small, and the sale of grain is not fair and reasonable enough, and even causes waste. These shortcomings must be resolutely overcome.
    The inability to fully meet the needs of the country and the people for grain cannot be completely avoided for a considerable period of time. This is because our country's industry has not yet developed to the point where it can reclaim large areas of wasteland and help the country's agriculture complete its technological transformation, and the task of agricultural cooperativization cannot be forcibly completed in a very short period of time by means of a blitzkrieg. In such a situation, mobilizing farmers across the country to increase grain production every year is the decisive link in solving the grain problem. Each increase in grain production will reduce the shortage of grain by one point. The increase in grain output depends on the high level of farmers' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, all measures in rural work must revolve around the link of increasing production, and must be conducive to giving play to farmers' enthusiasm for production; any damage to farmers' enthusiasm for production must be vigorously overcome and avoided.
    The main key to increasing farmers' enthusiasm for production at present is to improve the unified purchase and sale of grain and to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives strictly in accordance with the principle of voluntariness, and the former has a more widespread and significant impact. Unified purchase and sale of grain is an important aspect of the concrete expression of the relationship between the working class and the peasants. Our principle for solving the grain problem is to both control the necessary grain and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; to both take care of the needs of the country and protect the enthusiasm of the peasants. Therefore, it is very necessary to correctly stipulate the unified purchase figures and unified sales figures for grain. If the unified purchase figures are too large, and the farmers do not retain enough food grain, seeds, feed, and necessary flexible grain, it will hinder farmers' enthusiasm for production. However, on the other hand, it must also be seen that if the unified purchase figures are too small, it will not be possible to guarantee the needs of the country's industrialization, the needs of farmers lacking grain, farmers in economic crop areas, and farmers in disaster areas, and it will affect price stability and hinder the country's construction. Taking the method of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales is an important measure to ensure that the unified purchase and sale figures are practical and neither too high nor too low.
    By implementing the method of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, rural work cadres can also easily grasp the policies and distinguish the boundaries in grain work. According to the specific purchase and sales figures distributed by each locality, what should be purchased must be purchased in full, and what should not be purchased must be resolutely not purchased; what should be sold should be sold, and what should not be sold should not be sold. Grain work gradually moves towards institutionalization, not only can the coercive command style of certain cadres be overcome, but also the annual grain production and purchase and sale work will have appropriate pre-arrangements, which is also conducive to the unified deployment of rural work by party organizations at all levels.
    Grasping supply and marketing work and advocating saving grain are decisive issues in grain work in the future. The state has strictly controlled the purchase figures, and it must also strictly control the supply figures. Now the purchase figures stipulated by the state are very tight, and the sales plan formulated according to this figure must also be very tight. In the past, many regions emphasized unified purchase and neglected unified sales in grain work. Whether in cities or rural areas, there were many problems with unified sales work. In cities, unified grain sales are generally too loose, and there are serious phenomena of wasting grain in some places. In rural areas, the phenomenon of supplying what should not be supplied or insufficient supply exists, but in more cases, what should not be supplied is also supplied, and what should be supplied less is supplied more. This is partly due to insufficient publicity of saving in rural areas, and partly due to some staff members engaging in favoritism and corruption. This has increased the unified purchase task in grain-producing areas and endangered the state's grain balance sheet plan. Now the state has formulated a reasonable grain sales plan based on the grain purchase plan and the actual needs of all parties; this plan can only be reduced, not broken through. All personnel of state organs, state-owned enterprises, and the army must take the lead in saving grain, so as to drive the entire people to thoroughly eliminate the phenomena of wasting grain in every place and corner of the country and engaging in favoritism and corruption in grain work. In view of the fact that unfair and unreasonable phenomena in grain supply work are quite serious, and appropriately reducing sales is a reliable way to achieve the grain balance sheet plan, all localities should, according to different circumstances, organize the necessary forces to conduct an inspection of grain unified sales work in the near future, so that grain unified sales work is fair and reasonable, and ensures the smooth implementation of this year's grain sales plan.
    The vast number of working farmers in our country actively support the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Relying on the farmers' enthusiasm for production and the state's assistance to the farmers, our country's grain output has increased year by year, and the timely implementation of unified purchase and sale has basically met the needs of all aspects for grain. Now the state has also implemented the method of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, which fundamentally overcomes the shortcomings in the unified purchase and sale work. As long as farmers actively increase production, they can better meet the needs of national construction and better meet their own requirements for further developing production and improving their lives. Rural work comrades in all localities should fully use this important method to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production, and quickly, universally, and correctly convey it to the broad masses, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1955.

### 迅速向全体农民宣传粮食的“定产、定购、定销”

    迅速向全体农民宣传粮食的“定产、定购、定销”
    全国广大地区的农民正在开始春耕或准备春耕，为国家和自己生产大量的粮食和其他农作物。广大农民都了解增产粮食的重大意义，也看到两年来国家所实行的粮食统购统销的政策对于农民和全国人民都是必要的，有利的。但也有许多农民不知道：每年国家究竟要向他们征购多少粮食？他们生产的粮食，有多少归国家征购，有多少归自己支配？
    答复农民的这个问题是必要的。这对于提高农民的增产积极性有极大的关系。农民“摸了底”，才不会误以为他们生产得愈多，国家收购得愈多，农民所得的利益不够大。这就是说，国家每年征购粮食的一定的数目应当在春耕的时候就预先向农民宣布，好让农民根据这一点订出自己的增产计划。
    国务院和党中央要求全国各地应以乡为单位，迅速确定全乡的常年计划产量和全乡粮食统购统销的数字，一律向农民宣布，使每一户农民都知道自己起码应该生产多少粮食，使有余粮的农民知道自己只要卖给国家多少粮食，使缺粮的农民知道自己能够向国家购买多少粮食。国务院规定：在秋收后，只要年景正常，国家就按照春天宣布的数字向农民征购，无论农民增产了多少，征购的数字都不再变动。因此，农民就可以自己多留余粮，自由支配这些余粮，增加生产的利益就可以完全为农民所得。只在一省或全国范围内有某些地区发生严重灾荒的时候，灾区的粮食统购数字势必减少，灾区农民的粮食供应量势必增加，丰产地区的农民才需要多卖些粮食给国家，帮助国家调剂对灾区人民的供应；但增购的粮食数量，也不能超过丰收农民增产部分的百分之四十。
    本年度粮食预计统购数字，中央已经分配到各省，各省要很快按级分配到乡。各乡要用最快的方法传达到每户农民，使家家心中有数，早日把全年的家务安排妥当，积极投入春耕生产运动。
    国家实行粮食统购统销政策以来，成绩是伟大的。依靠这个正确的政策，国家合理地调剂和供应了各个方面对于粮食的需要。一亿左右的城市和工矿区的居民得到了适量的粮食供应。约五千万经济作物区的农民、五千万缺少口粮的农民和几千万在去年遭受水灾的农民，即约近二亿农民的口粮，两年来同样得到了基本的保证。我国产粮区的广大农民，节衣缩食，勤劳生产，踊跃地把粮食卖给国家，支援国家的工业建设，帮助缺粮农民渡过困难，对国家作了光荣的贡献。
    但是，由于我国的粮食产量在短期内不可能充分满足各方面的需要，由于统购统销是一项新的工作，还缺乏足够的经验，还不能马上建立一套详细周到的制度，在这项工作中间，就难免发生一些缺点，因为各乡征购的数字没有预先规定和宣布，农民容易感觉不摸底。有些地方的农民感到统购的数量大了一些，自己留下的数量少了一些，粮食的销售还有不够公平合理，甚至造成浪费的情形。这些缺点都必须坚决克服。
    粮食不能充分地满足国家和人民的需要，在一个相当长的时期内是不能完全避免的。这是因为我国的工业还没有发展到足以大量开垦荒地和帮助全国农业完成技术改造的程度，农业合作化的任务也不能在很短期间用突击的办法勉强完成。在这样的情况下，动员全国农民每年增加粮食的生产是解决粮食问题的决定环节。粮食生产增长一分，粮食不足的情况就会减少一分。粮食产量的增加取决于农民生产积极性的高涨。因此，农村工作的一切措施，都必须围绕着增加生产这个环节，都必须有利于发挥农民的生产积极性；对于农民的生产积极性的任何损害，都必须竭力克服和避免。
    当前提高农民生产积极性的主要关键是改善粮食的统购统销工作和严格按照自愿原则整顿巩固农业生产合作社，而前者的影响更为普遍和重大。粮食统购统销是具体表现工人阶级同农民关系的一个重要方面。我们解决粮食问题的原则是既要掌握必需的粮食，又要巩固工农联盟；既要照顾国家的需要，又要保护农民的积极性。因此，正确规定粮食的统购数字和统销数字是非常必要的。如果统购数字太大，农民的口粮、种子、饲料和必需的机动粮留得不够，就会妨害农民的生产积极性。但是在另一方面也必须看到，如果统购数字过小，就不能保证国家工业化的需要，不能保证缺粮农民、经济作物区的农民和灾区农民的需要，就会影响物价的稳定，妨碍国家的建设。采取定产、定购、定销的办法，就是保证统购统销数字切合实际、既不偏高，又不偏低的一项重要措施。
    实行粮食的定产、定购、定销的办法，农村工作干部在粮食工作中也就便于掌握政策，分清界限。各地根据分配的具体购销数字，该购的必须购足，不该购的坚决不购；该销的就销，不该销的就不销。粮食工作逐步走上制度化，不仅某些干部的强迫命令作风可以克服，而且全年的粮食生产和购销工作有了适当的预先的安排，也有利于各级党组织对农村工作进行统一的部署。
    抓紧供销工作，提倡节约粮食，是今后粮食工作中具有决定性的问题。国家严格控制了收购数字，也就必须严格控制供应数字。现在国家规定的收购数字是很紧的，根据这个数字订出的销售计划也就必须打得很紧。过去，许多地区在粮食工作中重视统购，忽视统销，无论城市和农村，统销工作都有不少问题。在城市，粮食统销一般偏松，有些地方有严重的浪费粮食的现象。在农村，应该供应而未供应或者供应不足的现象是存在的，但更多的情形是不该供应的也供应了，应该少供应的多供应了。这一部分是由于在农村中宣传节约不够，一部分是由于有些工作人员徇私舞弊。这就加重了粮食产区的统购任务，并使国家的粮食收支平衡计划有被突破的危险。现在国家根据粮食收购计划和各方面的实际需要，制定了合理的粮食销售计划；这个计划只许缩减，不许突破。我们国家粮食统销的原则是公平合理地组织供应，既要保证城乡人民合理的需要，又要努力缩减统销的数目，并努力减少粮食消耗。国家机关、国营企业和军队的全体人员要以身作则，力求节约粮食，以便带动全体人民，把全国各个地方、各个角落浪费粮食以及在粮食工作中徇私舞弊的现象彻底消灭。鉴于粮食供应工作中不公平合理的现象相当严重，适当压缩销售又是实现粮食收支平衡计划的可靠办法，各地应该根据不同情况，组织必要的力量，在最近期间对粮食统销工作进行一次检查，使粮食统销工作做到公平合理，保证本年度的粮食销售计划的顺利执行。
    我国广大劳动农民是积极拥护粮食统购统销政策的。依靠农民的生产积极性和国家对农民的援助，我国的粮食产量逐年增加，加以统购统销的及时实行，基本上适应了各方面对粮食的需要。现在国家又实行了粮食定产、定购、定销的办法，从根本上克服了统购统销工作中的缺点，农民只要积极增加生产，就能更好地适应国家建设的需要，更好地满足自己进一步发展生产、改善生活的要求。各地农村工作同志应当充分运用这一项提高农民生产积极性的重要办法，把它迅速地、普遍地、正确地传达到广大群众中去，为争取一九五五年的丰收而奋斗。
