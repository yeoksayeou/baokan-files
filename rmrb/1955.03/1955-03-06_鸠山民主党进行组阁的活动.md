Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd: Following the conclusion of the Japanese general election, the Hatoyama Democratic Party is engaged in forming a new cabinet. Since no single conservative party secured an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives in the election, the Japanese ruling group continues to face the difficulty of being unable to alter the long-standing instability of Japan's political situation.

　　Ichiro Hatoyama announced on the 1st that the Democratic Party would form a single-party cabinet. However, although the Democratic Party obtained a relatively large number of seats in the general election, it is far from enough to control more than half of the House of Representatives. The Democratic Party's position in the House of Councillors is even more difficult. In the 250 seats of the House of Councillors, the Democratic Party ranks fifth with only 21 seats. This situation forces the Democratic Party to seek the support of other parties in forming a cabinet and implementing various policies after taking power.

　　Ichiro Hatoyama said at a press conference on February 28th that the single-party cabinet he wants to form is a single-party cabinet based on policy agreements with other political parties. He also said that he intends to "handle diplomatic and other issues in a supra-partisan spirit." At the same time, many reports indicate that the Democratic Party mainly wants to obtain the support of the Liberal Party. Although the Liberal Party is basically the same as the Democratic Party on amending the constitution, rearmament, and domestic policies, it attacks Ichiro Hatoyama's policies toward the Soviet Union and China. The Democratic Party won more seats precisely because of its promise to normalize Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union during the election campaign. Therefore, how the Democratic Party intends to resolve its differences on foreign policy has become a serious test for the Democratic Party.

　　Meanwhile, the general secretaries of the left and right-wing Socialist Parties held a meeting on the 2nd to discuss the political situation after the general election. They decided that when the Diet convenes, the two parties will jointly support the chairman of the Left-wing Socialist Party, Mozaburo Suzuki, as a candidate for prime minister, and unanimously agreed to establish a consultation mechanism between the two parties to unify their actions in the Diet. On the same day, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a standing executive committee meeting, which decided to urge the left and right-wing Socialist Parties to merge. The General Council has submitted this decision to the chairmen of the left and right-wing Socialist Parties, Mozaburo Suzuki and Jotaro Kawakami.

### 鸠山民主党进行组阁的活动

    鸠山民主党进行组阁的活动
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：在日本大选结束以后，鸠山民主党正在进行组织新内阁的活动。由于没有一个保守政党在大选中取得众议院议席的绝对多数，日本统治集团仍然面临无法改变日本政局长期以来的不稳定状态的难题。
    鸠山一郎在一日宣布，民主党要组织一党内阁。但是民主党虽然在大选中得到了较多的议席，却远不足以控制众议院的过半数。民主党在参议院的地位更要困难得多。在参议院二百五十个议席里，民主党占第五位，只有二十一席。这种形势逼迫民主党在组织内阁以及当政后推行各种政策方面必须设法取得其他党派的支持。
    鸠山一郎二月二十八日在记者招待会上说：他所要组织的一党内阁是在和其他政党取得政策协议的基础上的一党内阁。他还说：他打算“以超党派的精神处理外交等问题”。同时，许多消息报道，民主党主要是想取得自由党的支持。而自由党虽然在修改宪法重新武装和国内政策上和民主党基本上相同，但是它攻击鸠山一郎对苏联和中国的政策。而民主党在竞选中正是靠了使日本和中、苏的关系正常化的诺言才取得较多的议席的，因此，民主党究竟打算怎样解决它们在外交政策上的分歧，就成了对民主党的一个严重考验。
    同时，左、右两派社会党的总书记在二日举行了会议，协商大选后的政局。他们决定在国会开会时两党联合支持左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎为首相候选人，并且一致同意要成立一个两党的协商机构，以便统一他们在国会的行动。在这同一天，日本工会总评议会举行了常任干事会会议，会上决定敦促左、右两派社会党合并。总评议会已经把这个决定交给了左、右派社会党主席铃木茂三郎和河上丈太郎。
