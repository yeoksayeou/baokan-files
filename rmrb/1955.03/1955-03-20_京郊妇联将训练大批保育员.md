With the spring plowing underway, the Democratic Women's Federations of various districts in the suburbs of Beijing are actively running training classes for key members of childcare organizations. The Women's Federations of various districts plan to recruit more than 850 cadres and childcare workers from the childcare groups of agricultural production cooperatives to attend the training classes. Currently, the training classes in the East Suburb District, Shijingshan District, and Jingxi Mining Area have concluded, with over 300 rural cadres and childcare workers learning the basic knowledge of new childcare methods, and also receiving training on how to organize and consolidate childcare organizations. The training classes in Nanyuan, Haidian, and other districts will also be fully completed by the end of March. These trained key members will undertake the work of establishing childcare groups in agricultural production cooperatives, enabling female cooperative members with children to participate in production with peace of mind.

    京郊妇联将训练大批保育员
    春耕开始了，北京市市郊各区民主妇女联合会正积极开办托儿组织骨干训练班。各区妇联组织准备吸收八百五十多名农业生产合作社托儿组的干部和保育员到训练班受训。目前，东郊区、石景山区和京西矿区的训练班已经结束，有三百多个农村干部和保育员学习了新育儿法的基本知识，同时受到了怎样组织和巩固托儿组织的训练。南苑、海淀等区的训练班三月底也可全部结束。这些受过训练的骨干分子，将担负起在农业生产合作社中建立托儿组的工作，使有孩子的女社员能安心地参加生产。     （据新华社讯）
