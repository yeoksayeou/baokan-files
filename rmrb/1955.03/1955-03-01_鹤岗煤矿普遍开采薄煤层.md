Hegang Coal Mine Universally Exploits Thin Coal Seams

The state-owned Hegang Coal Mine is now beginning to universally exploit thin coal seams in all its mines. Thin coal seams are coal layers sandwiched in the rock crevices of the roof or floor of the mine, with a maximum thickness of less than one meter and a minimum thickness of less than half a meter. In the past, people considered these coal seams impossible to mine. However, since the Mining Bureau implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion and began mining thin coal seams in the Nanshan No. 2 Mine in May of last year, as of February this year, just the 2011 working face has produced more than 20,000 tons of coal for the country, with costs reduced by two-thirds compared to other working faces, and has achieved safe production. Therefore, the leadership of the Hegang Mining Bureau has decided to universally exploit thin coal seams in mines such as Nanshan No. 1 Mine, Education Mine, Xingshan No. 4 Mine, and Dongshan No. 2 Mine this year. This will recover a large amount of coal for the country. According to statistics from the entire floor layer of the Education Mine alone, the reserves are approximately 2 million tons.

    鹤岗煤矿普遍开采薄煤层
    国营鹤岗煤矿正着手普遍开采各矿井薄煤层，薄煤层是夹在矿井顶板或底板石头缝里的煤层，最厚不到一公尺，薄的地方不到半公尺，过去，人们认为这是无法开采的煤层。可是自从矿务局执行了苏联专家建议，去年五月在南山二坑进行了薄煤层开采，到今年二月止，仅二○一一个场子就给国家多出两万多吨煤炭，成本比其他场子降低三分之二，并且做到了安全生产。因此，鹤岗矿务局领导决定今年在南山一坑、教育坑、兴山四坑、东山二坑等矿井普遍开采薄煤层。这样将给国家回收出大量煤炭，仅据教育坑全部底板层的统计，埋藏量即有二百万吨左右。                 （王训达）
