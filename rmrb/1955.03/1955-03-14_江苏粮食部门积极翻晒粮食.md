Jiangsu Grain Department Actively Turns and Dries Grain

    After the basic completion of grain requisitioning and purchasing work in various parts of Jiangsu Province, the grain departments have successively launched a general inspection of stored grain. In early February, the Nantong Special District dispatched cadres to form 21 groups to inspect the grain storage in various granaries. In Yixing County, more than 200 cadres participated in this work. During the inspection, various localities promptly handled any grain found to be at risk of mildew and spoilage. In the Xinhailian City, Dangshan, Suining, Donghai, and five other counties and cities of Xuzhou Special District, more than 10 million catties of insect-infested grain and grain with high moisture content have been turned, dried, and sifted. Many granaries have further carried out cleaning and sanitation work. Cadres from the grain departments in places such as Lizhuang in Dangshan County have also proposed plans to create mildew-free and insect-free granaries.

    江苏粮食部门积极翻晒粮食
    江苏省各地粮食部门在征粮购粮工作基本结束以后，相继展开普遍检查存粮的工作。南通专区在二月上旬就抽调干部组织了二十一个小组到各粮库检查存粮情况。宜兴县有二百多个干部参加了这项工作。各地在检查时发现有霉坏危险的粮食就及时处理。徐州专区的新海连市、砀山、睢宁、东海等八个县市，已经翻晒、过筛虫粮和高水分粮食一千多万斤。许多粮库进一步开展了清洁卫生工作。砀山县李庄等地粮食部门的干部、还提出了创造无霉粮仓和无虫粮仓的计划。
