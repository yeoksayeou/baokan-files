Commenting on President Tito's Speech
"Pravda" Observer

In his speech at the National Assembly meeting on March 7, Yugoslav President Tito discussed the current relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. He emphasized that considerable progress has been made in normalizing relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. As everyone knows, the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union noted the achievements made on this important issue. All peace-loving people, including the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples, are satisfied with this improvement in relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Undoubtedly, this normalization is a contribution to peace.

It is worth noting President Tito's remarks against the arms race. As everyone knows, since the end of World War II, the Soviet Union has been steadfastly fighting against the arms race and has put forward concrete proposals on this issue. Therefore, President Tito's condemnation of the arms race is welcomed by the Soviet people.

At the same time, when talking about Yugoslavia's relations with the Soviet Union, President Tito insisted that within the socialist camp, there were attempts to interpret the normalization of their relations with Yugoslavia as: "Although Yugoslavia is still as it was once accused, it has now somewhat recognized its mistakes and is trying to correct them." The President refuted this "explanation," considering it "not in line with the actual situation."

By the way, he did not specify—nor could he—who made this strange "explanation" and where. In any case, we can only say that no one in the Soviet Union thought of saying such a thing.

However, the Yugoslav President also said that in Molotov's speech at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the part about Yugoslavia "was consistent with those remarks in some respects." This requires clarifying the truth.

What exactly was said about Yugoslavia at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union? Molotov's report said: "It seems that Yugoslavia has, in recent years, departed to some extent from the position it adopted in the first few years after World War II. This is, of course, entirely its internal affair."

As everyone knows, developments in Yugoslavia took a turn in 1948. Many statements by Yugoslav leaders have elaborated on Yugoslavia's embarking on a new path of development after 1948. Just recently, Edvard Kardelj, in a report to a meeting of Norwegian Labor Party activists published in the New Year's issue of "Borba," also attempted to elaborate on the existence of two stages in Yugoslavia's development: the first stage before 1948, and the second stage after 1948, as stated by Kardelj and other Yugoslav leaders.

President Tito also made the same statement about two stages in a speech delivered at a rally in Kobar on November 21, 1954, in which he said: "Yugoslavia has not retreated from the diplomatic and political path it began to take in 1948."

What else can these statements by Yugoslav leaders mean other than confirming that "Yugoslavia has, in recent years, departed to some extent from the position it adopted in the first few years after World War II"?

In his report, President Tito felt it necessary to raise the issue of sincerity in the relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. However, whether a country's policy is sincere should be judged from facts, from concrete measures that actually guarantee normal relations between countries. What does President Tito's speech illustrate? Are there any practical and feasible suggestions for further improving relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union? The fact is that, unfortunately, there were no such suggestions in the speech. President Tito did not do this; instead, he talked about the past. He decided to remind Yugoslav social figures of the accusations made against the Yugoslav government in the past. However, when talking about the past, he did not mention a word about Yugoslavia's past direct and diverse expressions of hostility towards the Soviet Union. Adopting such an attitude may, in President Tito's words, "leave normalization half-finished and cause new suspicions."

For example, President Tito's claim that one side "conceals the truth from its people" is not in line with the actual situation.

This is the truth about historical facts. But this is not the main thing.

For everyone who looks forward rather than backward, for everyone who hopes to achieve truly lasting friendly relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the important thing is to develop the achievements made in normalizing relations and ensure the elimination of past hostilities. The Soviet Union, as has been repeatedly pointed out in recent years, firmly advocates the complete elimination of hostilities and the establishment of relations in a spirit of friendship and mutual respect. The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia must be based on joint efforts to strengthen peace and adhere to the principle of national independence. Only in this way will things not be left half-finished and will progress smoothly.

In recent years, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the leaders of Yugoslavia have stated more than once that both countries are concerned about the normalization of relations between them. The improvement of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly in the interests of our two peoples and will promote peace and international security. It should be remembered that the normalization of relations depends not only on the Soviet Union but also, to an equal extent, on Yugoslavia itself.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union firmly adopts the attitude that every country has the right to adopt any policy in its internal affairs and foreign policy.

In the Soviet Union, no one wants to "explain" the achievements made in normalizing relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia with the following statement: the leaders of Yugoslavia have now "recognized their mistakes" or are "trying to correct them." One thing is beyond doubt: expressions of hostility between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union will only benefit the enemies of the two countries and the two peoples, the enemies of peace, while eliminating hostility and improving relations can promote peace in the Balkans and throughout Europe.

Of particular importance is the coordination of the efforts of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in safeguarding peace and international security. In our opinion, what President Tito calls "active coexistence" should first and foremost focus on this aspect. In this regard, there is still much work to be done.

The development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is in line with the needs of strengthening peace. We, the Soviet people, have no doubt about this. This was stated extremely clearly at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Union strives to develop economic, political, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. At the same time, we strive to coordinate our efforts as much as possible in the cause of ensuring peace and international security, which is of decisive significance to the peoples of all countries. We are convinced that a positive approach in the development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is in the interests of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia."

    评铁托总统的演说
    “真理报”观察家
    南斯拉夫总统铁托在三月七日在国民议会会议发表的演说中，谈到南斯拉夫同苏联目前的关系。他强调指出：在苏联同南斯拉夫的关系正常化方面有了相当大的进展。大家知道，在苏联最高苏维埃最近的会议上，已经注意到在这个重要问题上所取得的成就。一切爱好和平的人民，包括苏联人民和南斯拉夫人民在内，对南斯拉夫同苏联和各人民民主国家间的关系的这种改善，都感到满意。无疑地，这种正常化是对和平的一种贡献。
    值得注意的是铁托总统的反对军备竞赛的言论。大家知道，从第二次世界大战结束的那一天开始，苏联就一直在坚定不移地为反对军备竞赛而斗争，而且还提出了关于这个问题的具体建议。因此，铁托总统对军备竞赛的谴责受到了苏联人民的欢迎。
    同时，铁托总统在谈到南斯拉夫同苏联的关系时，却硬说在社会主义阵营各国内，正在企图把它们同南斯拉夫的关系的正常化解释成这样：“虽然，到现在为止，南斯拉夫仍然像曾经被人指责的那样，不过它现在多少已经认识到它的错误，而且在设法改过自新。”总统驳斥了这种“解释”，认为是“不符合实际情况的”。
    顺便提一句，他并没有说明——他也几乎不能这样做——作这种奇怪的“解释”的是谁，又是在什么地方作的。不管怎样，我们只能说在苏联没有人想到要说这样的话。
    但是，南斯拉夫总统又说，在莫洛托夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的演说中，关于南斯拉夫那一部分“在某些方面是和那些言论一致的”。这就需要说明事实的真相了。
    在苏联最高苏维埃会议上，关于南斯拉夫究竟说了些什么呢？莫洛托夫的报告说：“看来，南斯拉夫近几年来在某种程度上离开了它在第二次世界大战以后的最初几年所采取的立场。这当然完全是它的内部事情。”
    大家知道，在一九四八年，南斯拉夫的事态发展发生了转变。南斯拉夫领导者们的许多言论详尽地说明了南斯拉夫在一九四八年后走上了一条新的发展道路。就在最近，爱德华·卡德尔在“战斗报”新年号公布的、他向挪威工党活动分子会议所作的报告中也曾经设法详尽地证实在南斯拉夫的发展中存在着两个阶段：第一个是一九四八年以前的阶段，第二个是卡德尔以及其他南斯拉夫领导者们所说的一九四八年以后的阶段。
    铁托总统在一九五四年十一月二十一日在科巴尔的一个集会上发表的演说中，也有同样的关于两个阶段的说法，他在这篇演说中说：“南斯拉夫并不是从它在一九四八年开始走的外交政治路线上退却。”
    南斯拉夫领导者们的这些声明除了证实“南斯拉夫近几年来在某种程度上离开了它在第二次世界大战以后的最初几年所采取的立场”以外，还能意味着其他什么呢？
    铁托总统在他的报告中认为必须提出苏联同南斯拉夫的关系中的诚意问题。但是，一个国家的政策是不是有诚意，应该从事实来看，应该从实际保证国与国之间的正常关系的具体措施来看，铁托总统的演说说明了什么呢？其中提出了进一步改善南斯拉夫同苏联的关系的切实可行的建议么？事实说明，演说中不幸并没有这样的建议。铁托总统并没有这样做，他倒是谈到过去。他决定向南斯拉夫社会人士提起过去对南斯拉夫政府提出的指责。但是，在谈到过去的时候，他对于南斯拉夫过去对苏联的直接的、多种多样的敌意表示，却只字不提。采取这种态度，真有可能，用铁托总统的话说，“使正常化半途而废，并且使人们产生新的猜疑”。
    例如，铁托总统所谓其中一方“向它的人民蒙蔽真相”这一点，就是不符合实际情况的。
    这就是关于历史事实的真相。但这还不是主要的。
    对每一个向前看而不是向后看的人来说，对每一个希望实现南斯拉夫同苏联的真正持久的友好关系的人来说，重要的事情是发展在使关系正常化方面取得的成就和保证消除过去的敌意。苏联，正像在最近几年来再三指出的，坚决主张完全消除敌意，主张本着友谊和互相尊敬的精神建立关系。苏联同南斯拉夫的关系的正常化必须以共同努力加强和平和遵守民族独立的原则为基础。这样，事情才不会半途而废，才会顺利前进。
    近年来，苏联的代表们和南斯拉夫的领导者们的言论中都不止一次地说，两国都关心它们之间的关系的正常化。南斯拉夫同苏联的关系的改善，无疑是符合我们两国人民的利益的，而且是会促进和平和国际安全的。应该记得，关系的正常化不仅取决于苏联，也在同等程度上取决于南斯拉夫自己。
    大家都知道，苏联坚决采取这样的态度：每一个国家都有权在它的内政和外交政策上采取任何方针。
    在苏联，谁也不想用以下的说法来“解释”在苏联同南斯拉夫的关系正常化方面所取得的成就，这种说法就是：南斯拉夫的领导者们现在已经“认识他们的错误”了，或者是“正在设法改过自新”。有一点是无可置疑的：南斯拉夫同苏联之间的敌意表示只会使两国和两国人民的敌人，和平的敌人得到好处，而消除敌意和改善关系却能促进巴尔干和整个欧洲的和平。
    具有特别大的重要性的是：协调苏联同南斯拉夫在保障和平和国际安全方面的努力。在我们看来，铁托总统所说的“积极共处”首先应该集中在这一方面。在这一方面，还有很多的工作要做。
    苏—南关系的发展是符合于加强和平的需要的。我们苏联人民对这一点是毫不怀疑的。在苏联最高苏维埃会议上，这一点是极其明确地说明了的：“苏联力求发展苏南两国的经济、政治和文化关系。同时我们竭力在保证和平和国际安全这样的对各国人民有决定性意义的事业中尽可能地协调彼此的努力。我们确信，在发展苏南关系中的积极方针既符合苏联的利益，也符合南斯拉夫的利益。”
