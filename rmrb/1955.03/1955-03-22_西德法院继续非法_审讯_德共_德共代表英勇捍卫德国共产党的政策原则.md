Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th – The West German Federal Constitutional Court, after a five-day recess, resumed its illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party on the 16th, according to the German News Agency. From the 16th to the 18th, the Bonn government continued to falsely accuse the German Communist Party of violating the constitution, claiming that because the goals of the German Communist Party are the same as those of the Soviet Communist Party, it should be banned. However, the Bonn side has been unable to produce evidence that the German Communist Party is violating Article 21 of the Bonn Constitution—which specifies which types of parties are unconstitutional.

During these three "trials," the representatives of the German Communist Party, Reisch, Fischel, and Krüger, spoke in succession. They sternly refuted the Bonn authorities' conspiracy to distort the German Communist Party's current policies and ultimate goals, and valiantly defended the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism and the policy principles of the German Communist Party. They pointed out that the German Communist Party never denies that it acts in accordance with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, but its current goal is not to destroy the bourgeois state in West Germany, but to strive for the reunification of Germany.

Krüger made an important defense speech on the 18th. He said: A scientific theory and a worldview based on scientific theory cannot be considered "constitutional" or "unconstitutional." The court disregarded this and insisted on bringing a theory with a history of more than 100 years, spread all over the world, and used by more than one-third of the world's population to establish a social order to the court for "trial." The Bonn government has not been able to prove that the actions of the German Communist Party violate the constitution. According to the constitution, this must be proven in order to ban the German Communist Party.

The "trial" will continue on the 21st.

    西德法院继续非法“审讯”德共
    德共代表英勇捍卫德国共产党的政策原则
    【新华社柏林二十日电】据德意志通讯社报道，西德联邦宪法法院经过五天的休庭，又从十六日开始继续对德国共产党进行非法“审讯”。从十六日到十八日，波恩政府方面仍然诬指德国共产党违反宪法，他们说，因为德国共产党的目标同苏联共产党相同，因此应该取缔。但是，波恩方面怎么样也提不出证据可以证明德国共产党是违反波恩宪法第二十一条——载明那一类政党违宪——的条款。
    在这三次“审讯”中，德国共产党的代表雷熙、费希和克吕格尔相继发言。他们严词驳斥了波恩当局歪曲德国共产党当前政策和最后目标的阴谋，并且英勇地捍卫了马克思—列宁主义的思想体系和德国共产党的政策原则。他们指出：德国共产党从不否认它是遵照马克思—列宁主义的理论行动的，但是，它当前的目标并不是在西德摧毁资产阶级的国家，而是争取德国的统一。
    克吕格尔在十八日作了重要的辩护发言。他说：一种科学理论和建基于科学理论的世界观是不能被认为“合乎宪法”或“不合宪法”的。法庭竟不顾这一点，硬把有一百多年历史的、传遍了全世界的、为世界三分之一以上的人口所依据而建立了社会秩序的理论拿到法庭上来“审讯”。波恩政府方面一直到现在没有能够证明德国共产党的行动是违反宪法的。而根据宪法，要取缔德国共产党，这一点是必须证明的。
    “审讯”将在二十一日继续进行。
