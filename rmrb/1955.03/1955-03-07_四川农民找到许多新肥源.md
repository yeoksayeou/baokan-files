    Sichuan Province farmers have recently found more than forty new sources of fertilizer. For example, the *Melia azedarach* tree, whose seeds can be pressed for oil and the resulting seed cake used as fertilizer, is found everywhere in the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province, but in the past, few farmers utilized it. Now, farmers in the mountainous regions have begun to widely press *Melia azedarach* seed cake. Chongqing County farmers alone plan to press about 1 million *jin* of *Melia azedarach* seed cake this year. In Fuling County, famous for its pickled mustard tubers, farmers are for the first time making extensive use of discarded pickled mustard tuber skins from workshops to make compost; it is estimated that more than 2.5 million *jin* of compost can be made in the first quarter. In addition, various other new fertilizers have been discovered.
    The discovery of these new fertilizer sources has helped farmers obtain more natural fertilizer than in previous years. According to statistics from some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Nanchong, Suining, Neijiang, and other regions: From around the Spring Festival to now, more than 500 million *jin* of various natural fertilizers have been accumulated. Calculated at 800 *jin* of base fertilizer applied per *mu* of paddy field, this can meet the needs of more than 620,000 *mu* of paddy fields.

    四川农民找到许多新肥源
    四川省农民最近找到了四十多种新的肥料来源。如可以榨油取饼做肥料的苦楝子，四川省山区到处都有，过去很少有农民去利用它。现在山区农民已开始普遍榨制苦楝子饼。仅崇庆县农民今年就准备榨制苦楝子饼一百万斤左右。在出产榨菜著名的涪陵县，今年农民第一次大量利用作坊丢弃的榨菜皮来制作堆肥，预计第一季度可制作成堆肥二百五十多万斤。另外还发现其他各种各样的新肥料。
    这些新肥源的发现，帮助农民得到了比往年更多的自然肥料。据南充、遂宁、内江等专区的部分农业生产合作社和互助组统计：从春节前后到现在，已积了各种自然肥料五亿多斤。如以每亩稻田施底肥八百斤计算，可以满足六十二万多亩稻田的需要。　（新华社）
