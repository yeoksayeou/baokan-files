A Factory with Low Product Quality and Serious Waste
By Our Correspondent Liu Qun

The production situation at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory is extremely chaotic, to the point where it fails to meet national plans every month and has to rely on state credit to maintain production.

The low quality of products from this factory causes serious losses to the state. From January to October 1954, due to poor product quality, failure to deliver on time, and the need for rework, the production of one hundred factories and mines was affected. It caused the Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory and the Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory to fail to complete their production tasks; it affected the power and water supply of the Changchun and Shenyang water plants; it affected the power transmission of the Xinjiang Power Plant; after the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine was put into production, it could not expand production due to a lack of switchboards, and ten electric shovels were forced to stop production for three or four months; the Jingbo Lake Power Plant could not carry out inspections on schedule due to the three postponements of the delivery of switchboards; fires broke out in voltage transformers at the Electrical Machinery Factory due to the poor quality of the products from the High-Voltage Switch Factory... These losses are incalculable. In order to rework the substandard products, the High-Voltage Switch Factory established a rework team of more than one hundred people. Workers traveled by train, ship, and plane to repair products all over the country. According to preliminary calculations, the repair costs lost from January to September of last year alone amounted to 3.43 billion yuan in old currency. To repair some of the substandard products in the factory's inventory, the loss of labor and materials alone will amount to 6 billion yuan in old currency.

The waste inside the factory is shocking. Once, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the second workshop only spent ten minutes picking up screws, washers, insulating materials, etc., from the ground, which totaled more than 1 million yuan in old currency. Each workshop throws away a lot of materials in the "garbage" every day. From January to September of last year, the general affairs section sold "waste materials" picked up from these "garbage" for 700 million yuan in old currency. More than 4,000 good parts such as refueling seats produced by the workshop were lost after being sent to the warehouse, resulting in a loss of 210 million yuan in old currency for this item alone. Due to lack of responsibility, randomly modifying Soviet drawings caused even greater waste. In September, it was found that there were as many as 3,500 incorrect drawings in use in the factory's workshops. Twenty-two kinds of parts were completely scrapped due to the modification of drawings, resulting in a loss of more than 753.3 million yuan in old currency. There were also products that were sent to the wrong address, causing waste. From January to September of last year, 174 cases of waste were initially found throughout the factory, resulting in a total loss of 23.2 billion yuan in old currency!

A large number of raw materials, finished products, and semi-finished products are piled up around the warehouse and factory buildings of the High-Voltage Switch Factory, with a backlog value of 123.434 billion yuan in old currency.

Accidents occur constantly during production. From January to August of last year, there were 394 machine tool accidents; there were 60 personal accidents in five months.

Theft also occurs frequently in this factory. In the materials warehouse of one workshop, the storekeeper discovered that materials were lost one day, so the next day he installed barbed wire on the materials warehouse, and the thieves came again on the third day. The thieves used pliers to cut the barbed wire, stole the materials, and then welded the barbed wire back together with electric welding.

These chaotic phenomena have paralyzed the production work of the High-Voltage Switch Factory. From January to October of last year, not only were the five targets set by the state not completed, but the cost was increased. The entire factory is in serious financial difficulty, owing as much as 100 billion yuan in old currency to the bank, and having to pay interest of 480 million yuan in old currency every month.

The main reason why this factory has so many problems is that the factory's leading cadres are seriously corroded by bourgeois ideology, the party's work in this factory is weak, and the entire production is divorced from the party's strong leadership and supervision.

The factory's leading cadres, headed by factory director Zhu Zijian, have long lacked the concept of fully completing the state plan. In 1952, this factory failed to complete the state plan for ten consecutive months. After Zhu Zijian took office, production improved somewhat, so he became complacent! At this time, the Electrical Industry Administration again encouraged him, saying: "We will award you a big red flag if you complete the task." In order to show "achievements," the entire factory, under the guidance of Zhu Zijian's wrong thinking, embarked on the road of pursuing product quantity by any means. In the last ten days of each month, cadres were organized to go to the workshops to urge workers to rush quantity. When it was found that parts did not meet the specifications and affected the completion of the state plan, the administration called on the technical departments to "combine with reality" and "cooperate vigorously." As a result, the design or process department had to rush to write "technical liaison slips" for qualified products, so that unqualified products could leave the factory. Backward workers call this liaison slip a "living Bodhisattva," with which they no longer worry about being unable to deliver unqualified products. When inspectors were not allowed to pass unqualified products, workshop cadres would go to the factory director, and the technical department would release the unqualified products, resulting in seven consecutive incidents of workers beating inspectors. When the materials department bought unqualified products, in order to rush the task, the factory director approved the technical department to write "substitution notices" for unqualified materials. The administrative leadership can also send semi-finished products into the warehouse and report to the higher authorities, saying: "The task has been completed." It is now found that there are a large number of defective and reworked products among the finished products in the warehouse, including 561 switchboards, 260 oil circuit breakers, and 152 manual mechanisms. The product quality is thus declining day by day, and more and more products that have already left the factory are being sent back for repair.

Zhu Zijian is a member of the factory's party general branch committee, but he does not respect the party's collective leadership, does not rely on the party organization to carry out work, but acts arbitrarily. He not only undermined the collective leadership of the party's general branch committee, but also used many methods to turn the party organization into a general administrative department. The secretary of the party's general branch committee and other members are all new cadres. Zhu Zijian is an old cadre and an old party member. He has the responsibility to help establish the party's normal working order and strengthen the enterprise's political and ideological leadership, but he did not do so. He mistakenly emphasized: "Collective leadership is reflected in the party, government, labor union, and youth league." And said: "It's troublesome to hold a general branch committee meeting, just have everyone meet every day!" Many major issues such as production plans and decisions were not reported to the party's general branch committee, but were decided by the administration alone or discussed at "coordination meetings." The meetings were all presided over by Zhu Zijian, and the secretary of the party's general branch only attended the meetings as an observer, which was essentially the factory director giving orders. In April of last year, the First Ministry of Machine Building held a factory director's meeting, which decided to strengthen plan management and improve product quality. Instead of submitting such an important decision to the party committee for discussion on how to implement it, the factory convened a "coordination meeting" at which Zhu Zijian presided over the meeting to convey and deploy, and designated: "Party and mass cadres should discuss and deliberate with each group separately..." The general branch committee was replaced by the "coordination meeting," and the collective leadership was replaced by Zhu Zijian personally. The party organization could not carry out political and ideological leadership and had to do administrative work, helping the administration to arrange production plans and schedules, compile plans, and expedite the processing of parts. On June 18, 1954, the party's general branch committee held an enlarged meeting. The resolution of this meeting even wrote down the specific tasks of each person in the workshop, and the resolution became a work plan. Each workshop branch also learned this approach. Once, in order to complete the plan, the secretary and cadres of the party's general branch took up tools and participated in production together, making a rush job for two weeks. In this way, Zhu Zijian developed wantonly and unscrupulously to the point that: on the one hand, he turned a blind eye to the phenomenon of wasting state resources; on the other hand, after hearing the news of the unified purchase of grain, he immediately sent someone to snap up fifty catties of rice.

The party's general branch committee in the factory not only failed to use the weapon of criticism to fight against the chaotic situation in production and Zhu Zijian's wrong thinking, but was weak and took a conciliatory attitude, fearing that criticizing superiors would be "unfavorable to oneself," criticizing peers would "cause disunity," and criticizing subordinates would "affect work," thus relaxing the struggle against bourgeois ideology. This allowed Zhu Zijian's bourgeois ideology to run rampant. Liu Guoren, the secretary of the general branch, often said to everyone: "Let's forget it, don't cause disunity, we haven't completed our production tasks yet, let's think of ways to do our job well..." Others had opinions on Zhu Zijian's work and lifestyle, but they did not dare to criticize Zhu Zijian at the party's meetings. Sometimes, Liu Guoren used the method of sending a letter to Wang Demin, the deputy factory director, saying: "Tell factory director Zhu that others have opinions on him and should pay attention..." Zhu Zijian, after hearing this, instead said: "Secretary Liu is engaging in a 'united front' with me." At that time, cadres from the Electrical Industry Administration came to inspect the work and also put forward opinions on improving quality. However, the secretary of the party's general branch still believed that the quality problem was not serious, and said: "If we focus on quality, we will not be able to complete the production plan." Regarding quality and the state plan as opposites, it was thus delayed and not resolved. Once, Dai Runtian, the organization member of the general branch, gave Liu Guoren an opinion, saying: "We must launch an ideological struggle within the party. Look at you, before you even sit down, you run to the factory department to hold a 'coordination meeting,' what is the party leading?" Liu Guoren replied: "Let's forget it, who cares who has what? It's about getting things done, criticism has to come slowly." Naturally, these people are all newly promoted cadres, and they do have some difficulties in their work due to lack of work experience, but it is wrong not to actively fight against wrong thinking. The result of doing so is that it is impossible to reverse the production situation, nor can Zhu Zijian be made to correct his mistakes.

Due to the influence of Zhu Zijian's wrong thinking and practices, and because the party's general branch committee abandoned the struggle, many other problems occurred in the factory. The idea of "relying on the working class" became weaker and weaker. When formulating the state plan, workers were only formally allowed to discuss it, but in essence, "discussion or no discussion, these are the tasks." From January to September of last year, there were an average of more than a dozen rationalization proposals every month, but they often could not be resolved, which greatly damaged the workers' enthusiasm. For example, workers had proposed six important suggestions, such as changing the air pump to a water pump to prevent explosions without using oxygen, but no one paid attention to them from February of last year until the end of the year. Many people did not cherish state property and allowed it to be wasted and lost. The tendency to ignore political and ideological work is also growing. Cadres are generally not interested in political life, and many party members are unwilling to take on party work, do not attend party meetings, and do not study.

The problems existing in the High-Voltage Switch Factory are serious. The leadership of the Electrical Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building is also responsible for these errors. They failed to discover these problems early on. Although some problems were known, inspections were carried out, and some solutions were proposed, there was a lack of further inspections and failure to effectively solve the relevant problems, so that the factory's production situation could not be fundamentally reversed. This is actually a bureaucratic attitude. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also failed to discover the seriousness of this problem early on. In the past, they had learned about some situations and had received reports from the general branch committee of the High-Voltage Switch Factory, but they did not conduct in-depth inspections and launch criticism against various erroneous ideas. In particular, they did not inspect the work of the general branch committee of the factory and help them establish a normal working order, making the general branch committee weak and ineffective. Now, the Shenyang Municipal Committee has inspected the work of the factory and has begun to help improve production work in some aspects, but this is only the beginning. To this end, it is recommended that relevant departments, especially the Electrical Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building, conduct a more in-depth inspection of the factory's work, take important measures, and change the chaotic situation in the leadership and production work of the High-Voltage Switch Factory, so that this factory can better serve the country's construction.

    一个产品质量低劣、浪费严重的工厂
    本报记者　刘群
    沈阳高压开关厂的生产情况十分混乱，以致月月完不成国家计划，要靠国家信贷维持生产。
    这个工厂产品质量低劣，给国家造成的损失是严重的。从一九五四年一月到十月，因产品质量低劣，不能按期交货和需要返修，曾使一百个工厂、矿山生产受到损失。使湘潭电机厂、上海华通开关厂完不成生产任务；影响了长春、沈阳自来水厂送电供水；影响了新疆发电厂送电；阜新海州露天矿投入生产以后，因缺开关板不能扩大生产，十付电铲被迫停产三、四个月；镜泊湖发电厂由于开关板三次延期交付不能按期进行检修；电工机械厂由于高压开关厂产品质量低劣发生电压互感器起火……。这些损失是无法计算的。为了返修质量低劣的产品，高压开关厂成立了一支一百多人的返修大队。工人们坐火车、轮船、飞机到全国各地去忙修理。初步计算，去年一至九月光损失的修理费用达旧币三十四亿三千多万元。要修好厂内库存的一些不合格的产品，仅工料即将损失旧币六十亿元。
    工厂内部的浪费现象，令人触目惊心。有一次二车间团支部书记只花十分钟的工夫，在地下拣起的螺丝、垫圈、绝缘材料等即合旧币一百多万元。各车间每天扔掉的“垃圾”里面带出很多材料。从去年一月到九月，总务科在这些“垃圾”里拣出来的“废料”就卖了旧币七亿元。车间生产好的加油座等部件四千余件，送到库里后丢失了，光这一项就损失旧币二亿一千万元。由于无人负责，乱改苏联图纸造成浪费数目更大。九月份统计全厂各车间正在使用的有错误的图纸竟达三千五百张。有二十二种零件由于修改图纸全部作废，损失达旧币七亿五千三百余万元。还有的产品运送错了地址，造成了浪费。全厂从去年一月到九月，初步查出一百七十四件浪费事实，共损失旧币二百三十二亿元！
    在高压开关厂的仓库和厂房周围摆满了大批的原材料、成品或半成品，积压价值旧币一千二百三十四亿三千四百万元。
    生产中，事故不断发生。去年一至八月份机床事故达三百九十四次；人身事故在五个月当中就有六十次。
    偷窃行为在这个厂内也常发生。有一个车间的材料库，头天保管员发现丢失了材料，第二天把材料库安上了铁丝网，第三天小偷又来了。盗贼用钳子把铁丝网剪断，偷出材料之后，然后再把铁丝网用电焊焊好。
    这种种混乱现象，使高压开关厂的生产工作瘫痪了。由去年一月到十月，不但未完成国家规定的五个指标，反而把成本提高了。整个工厂的资金非常困难，仅欠银行的贷款即达旧币一千亿元，每月要付利息旧币四亿八千万元。
    这个工厂所以存在这样多的问题，最主要的原因是厂的领导干部受到资产阶级思想的严重腐蚀，这个厂的党的工作薄弱，以致整个生产脱离了党的有力的领导和监督。
    以厂长朱子坚为首的厂的领导干部，长期没有全面完成国家计划的观点。一九五二年这个工厂一连十个月没完成国家计划。朱子坚到任以后，生产有些好转，于是就得意起来了！这时电器工业管理局又鼓励他说：“完成任务奖给你们大红旗。”为了表现“成绩”，全厂在朱子坚的错误思想指导下，走上了不择手段、单纯追求产品数量的道路。到每月下旬，组织干部分头下车间，催促工人赶数量，发现部件不合规格影响到完成国家计划时，行政上号召技术部门要“结合实际”“大力配合”。于是设计或工艺部门，只好忙着为合格品写“技术联络单”，可使不合规格产品出厂。落后的工人把这种联络单叫做“活菩萨”，有了它，再不愁不合格产品交不出去了。检查人员不允许不合规格产品通过时，车间干部就去找厂长，技术部门就把不合格的产品放过，以致工人打检查人员的事件一连发生七次。材料部门买来不合规格产品时，为了赶任务，厂长批准要技术部门为不合格的材料写“代用通知单”。行政领导方面还可以把半成品送进库里，向上报告说：“完成任务。”现在发现入库的成品当中有大批的废品和返修品，仅开关板就有五百六十一台，油断路器有二百六十台，手动机构一百五十二台。产品质量就这样天天在下降，已经出厂的产品，送回修理的越来越多。
    朱子坚是工厂党总支委员会的委员，却不尊重党的集体领导，不依靠党的组织进行工作，而是独断专行。他不仅破坏了党总支委员会的集体领导，而且通过许多办法把党的组织变成一般的行政工作部门使用。党总支委员会书记和其他委员都是新干部，朱子坚是个老干部、老党员，有责任帮助建立党的正常工作秩序，加强企业的政治思想领导，但他没有这样作。他错误地强调：“集体领导就是表现在党、政、工、团的身上。”并说：“开总支委员会麻烦，每天大家碰碰头就行了！”许多生产计划、决定等重大问题，他不向党总支委员会报告、而单是由行政上决定，或在“碰头会”上商量。会议都是由朱子坚主持，党总支书记只是以列席的身份参加会议，这实质上是厂长个人在发号施令。去年四月，第一机械工业部召开厂长会议，决定要加强计划管理，提高产品质量。这样重大的决定，该厂不是交党委讨论如何执行，而是在一次“碰头会”上由朱子坚主持传达布置，并指定：“党群干部要分别和各组讨论、酝酿。……”总支委员会被“碰头会”代替，集体领导被朱子坚个人代替，党的组织无法进行政治思想领导，只好去做行政工作，帮助行政排生产计划进度、编计划、催加工部件。一九五四年六月十八日，党总支委员会召开扩大会议，在这次会的决议上竟写上车间里每一个人的具体任务，决议变成了作业计划。各个车间支部，也都学习这种作法。有一次，为了完成计划，党总支书记、干事，拿起工具一起参加生产，突击了两个星期。这样，朱子坚就为所欲为毫无顾虑地一直发展到：一方面对浪费国家资财的现象置若罔闻；另一面，听到粮食统购消息后，立刻派人抢购了五十斤大米。
    厂里的党总支委员会，对生产上的混乱情况，对朱子坚的错误思想，不但未能运用批评的武器进行斗争，反而软弱无力，采取迁就的态度，怕批评上级“对自己不利”、批评同级“闹不团结”、批评下级“影响工作”，因而放松了对资产阶级思想的斗争。使朱子坚资产阶级思想可以横行无阻。总支书记刘国仁常向大家说：“算了吧，别闹不团结，咱们生产任务还完不成呢，大家想办法把工作搞好……”。别人对朱子坚工作和生活作风有意见，却不敢在党的会议上对朱子坚进行批评。有时候刘国仁用捎信的办法，找王德民副厂长说：“你告诉朱厂长一声，别人对他有意见，要注意一下……。”朱子坚听了反而说：“刘书记在跟我搞‘统一战线’哩。”当时电器工业管理局的干部来检查工作，也提出改进质量的意见。但党总支书记还认为质量问题并不严重，并表示：“搞质量，我们就完不成生产计划了。”把质量和国家计划看成是对立的事，所以一直拖延下去未获得解决。有一次，总支组织委员戴润田给刘国仁提意见说：“咱们要展开党内思想斗争。看你，屁股还没贴椅子，就往厂部跑开‘碰头会’，党领导什么呢？”刘国仁回答说：“算了吧，谁找谁有啥？办的是事情，要批评得慢慢来。”自然，这些人都是新提拔起来的干部，因工作经验少，工作中确实有些困难，但不积极向错误思想进行斗争却是不对的。这样作的结果，就不可能扭转生产局面、也不能使朱子坚改正错误。
    由于朱子坚错误思想、作法的影响，由于党总支委员会放弃了斗争，工厂中还发生其他的许多问题。“依靠工人阶级”的思想愈来愈薄弱。制订国家计划时，只是形式上让工人讨论，实质上是“讨论也是这些任务，不讨论也是这些任务”。去年一月至九月，平均每月都有十几件合理化建议，但常常得不到解决，就大大损害了工人的积极性。例如，工人曾提出把打气泵改用打水泵，不用氧气，可以防止爆炸事故等六项重要建议，从去年二月提出，直到年底无人过问。许多人不爱护国家财富，任其浪费丢失。忽视政治思想的倾向也在滋长。干部普遍对政治生活不感兴趣，不少党员不愿意担任党的工作，不参加党的会议、不学习。
    高压开关厂存在的问题是严重的，这些错误，第一机械工业部电器工业管理局的领导方面也有责任，他们未能及早发现这些问题，有些问题虽然知道，虽进行了检查，也提出过一些解决的办法，但是缺乏进一步的检查，未能切实解决有关问题，以致未能从根本上扭转该厂生产的局面，这实际上是一种官僚主义的态度。中共沈阳市委员会，也未能及早发现这一问题的严重性，过去曾了解到一些情况，曾接到高压开关厂总支委员会的报告，却没有进行深入检查，对各种错误思想展开批判。特别是没有对该厂总支委员会工作加以检查，帮助他们建立正常的工作秩序，使总支委员会变得软弱无力了。现在，沈阳市委已经检查了该厂的工作，并已着手从某些方面帮助改进生产工作，但这仅是开始。为此，建议有关部门，特别是第一机械工业部电器工业管理局，要对该厂工作进行更深入的检查，采取重要措施，改变高压开关厂的领导工作和生产工作上的混乱情况，使这个工厂更好地为国家建设服务。
