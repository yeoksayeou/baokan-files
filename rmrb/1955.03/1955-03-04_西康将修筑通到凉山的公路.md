Xikang Province has decided to begin construction on the Xichang-Zhaojue Highway in late April. The recently established Xichang-Zhaojue Highway Construction Preparatory Office is currently preparing various equipment, tools, and materials for construction sheds along the route. On February 15th, more than ten engineering personnel were dispatched to conduct resurveying and alignment work along the route.

The Xichang-Zhaojue Highway is 122 kilometers long and is expected to be completed in two years. This year, the 59-kilometer section from Xichang to Jiefanggou will be completed. The completion of this highway will further promote the political, economic, and cultural development of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region. Currently, transportation from Xichang to Zhaojue by pack animal takes three to four days. In the future, transportation by automobile will take less than a day.

Cadres and people in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang were very happy to hear the news of the highway construction. Ni Di Mugu, an Yi cadre from Liangshan, said that he would vigorously mobilize the masses to support the highway construction, so that Liangshan could be closely connected with other regions as soon as possible.

    西康将修筑通到凉山的公路
    西康省西（昌）昭（觉）公路决定在四月下旬开工修筑。最近成立的西昭公路工程筹备处，目前正在准备各种器材、工具和沿线工棚的材料，并在二月十五日派出十多名工程人员到沿线进行复测对线工作。
    西昭公路全长一百二十二公里，预计两年完工，今年完成西昌至解放沟段的五十九公里。这条公路修通后，将促进凉山彝族自治区的政治、经济、文化的进一步发展。从西昌到昭觉，目前由驮马运输需要三、四天，将来由汽车运输，不到一天的时间便可到达。
    西康凉山彝族自治区的干部和群众听到修筑公路的消息后，都很高兴，凉山彝族干部尼的木姑说，他要大力发动群众支援修筑公路，使凉山早日和外区密切地联系起来。
