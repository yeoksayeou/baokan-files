Who is Creating Difficulties for Disarmament Negotiations
    Feng BinFu

    Soviet representative to the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, Gromyko, made a statement to reporters on the 24th, using irrefutable facts to expose the Western countries' conspiracy to create numerous obstacles in the London disarmament negotiations and attempt to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union. This exposure allows the people of the world to see the truth: who is obstructing disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and who is tirelessly striving for an agreement on the fundamental issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons to ensure world peace.

    In the United Nations, for nine years, there have always been two lines regarding disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons: one is the Soviet Union's persistent efforts for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; the other is the Western countries, led by the United States, constantly obstructing and delaying this fundamental issue concerning world peace and security. The creation of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee was an achievement of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and a result of the Soviet Union's repeated insistence at the February 1954 Berlin Conference. The task of the Subcommittee should be to attempt once again to reach an agreement on the reduction of armaments and armed forces, as well as on the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Due to the pressure of the strong desire of the world's peace-loving people for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the Western countries, led by the United States, had no choice but to agree to participate in the work of the disarmament subcommittee. However, they were actually interested not in genuinely reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, but in continuing the arms race and preparing for an atomic war "position of strength" policy. The various obstructive behaviors displayed by the Western countries' representatives during the work process at Lancaster House in London fully prove this point.

    One of the main obstacles they created was the stubborn refusal to consider the nature of the measures taken in disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, but instead to put international supervision in the primary position, apart from the above measures. The Soviet proposal unequivocally pointed out that international supervision of the implementation of mutually agreed decisions is as important and necessary as making decisions on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. The Western countries insisted on first establishing an international supervisory body, which, in the first stage, that is, before the measures to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons are implemented, would have the right of inspection. What is the purpose of international supervision? Of course, it should be for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. It is inconceivable to talk about "international supervision" without talking about measures for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. That is by no means a genuine supervision of disarmament and the prohibition of the most dangerous weapons, but merely a revival of the Baruch Plan for the aggressive purposes of American imperialism. Everyone knows that the so-called Baruch Plan was an attempt, under the guise of international supervision, to ensure that the United States would not only de facto control atomic energy for military targets, but also de jure supervise it. The 1946 Baruch Plan had already failed. It is now 1955. However, the Western countries have returned to the original starting point of nine years ago. This shows that they are not willing to seriously discuss the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Another major obstacle they created was opposition to the Soviet Union's proposal for the five major powers to substantially reduce armaments and troops. They could not verbally disagree with the five major powers substantially reducing armaments. But they cunningly attempted to replace the mutually agreed quotas for reducing armaments and armed forces with the issue of the level (quantity) of armaments and armed forces, in order to obstruct the reaching of an agreement. It is clear that when stipulating the quotas for disarmament, it is necessary to determine the standards based on the rational balance of power that countries mutually believe is maintained for security, including factors such as population, geography, economy, and politics, and certainly not based on simple mathematical viewpoints. If based on this mathematical viewpoint, even they themselves admit that, in some cases, there may even be reason to raise the issue of increasing armed forces and armaments. From this, it can be seen that the Western countries' stubborn insistence on this unworkable mathematical viewpoint shows that they are fundamentally unwilling to end the arms race, because the arms race is very necessary for monopoly capital to seize huge profits.

    It is precisely because of this stubbornly obstructive position of the Western countries that the London Lancaster House disarmament negotiations, which began on February 25, have so far not achieved any success. The Western countries, led by the United States, still hold the old policy of obstructing the reaching of an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, on the one hand, neither putting forward constructive new proposals themselves, and on the other hand, doing everything possible to obstruct the Soviet Union's sincere efforts to seek agreement. Not only that, they are also constantly issuing remarks that confuse international public opinion, insisting that the difficulties encountered by the subcommittee are caused by the Soviet Union's position, attempting to deceive the world and shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union.

    However, the facts cannot be obliterated. The conspiracy of the Western warmongering group to deceive and slander cannot withstand being placed in broad daylight. Everyone knows that when the London disarmament negotiations began, the Soviet Union put forward active and practical proposals, advocating the destruction of existing stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and no increase in armaments, troops, and military appropriations. Because the United States, Britain, and France insisted on opposing the position, the Soviet Union proposed a new proposal on February 18 for an international convention on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. This proposal takes the proposals put forward by France and Britain on June 11, 1954, as the basis of this convention. In addition to containing the basic principles of the international convention on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the new Soviet proposal also proposed a procedure for implementing disarmament, stipulating that only measures to reduce conventional armaments should be taken at the beginning, in order to facilitate reaching the necessary understanding. This is a constructive step forward. This step shows that the peace-loving Soviet Union, for the lofty purpose of saving mankind from suffering and disaster, is always unremittingly striving to reach an agreement acceptable to all. The Soviet Union's positive and realistic spirit for peace can be said to be the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness.

    The struggle between the two lines of war and peace, sincerity and malice, is particularly clear in the London Lancaster House disarmament negotiations. Two attitudes, two purposes, are clearly distinguished, and right and wrong are clear. Who is creating difficulties for the London disarmament negotiations, is it not clear?

    It is becoming increasingly clear that the people who insist on the "policy of strength" have come to London to negotiate in order to pretend to be doing something, attempting to deceive the broad masses of people who urgently expect disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This is why, when the London negotiations, which the world is closely watching, are about to begin, American authorities and American public opinion deliberately spread a pessimistic atmosphere about the possibility of reaching an agreement. This is why, when the Soviet Union openly announced its disarmament proposals, the United States and Britain panicked, insisting that "the Russians violated" the Subcommittee's "rules of confidentiality." This is why, when the disarmament subcommittee is increasingly arousing the indignation of the world due to their obstructive actions, they are reversing black and white, spreading slander, attempting to prove that it is the Soviet Union, not them, who are obstructing the reaching of an agreement! This is also why, when the representatives of the five countries are discussing disarmament and the prohibition of atomic war plans in London, American and British authorities have successively issued remarks advocating atomic war.

    Gromyko's speech explained the actual situation of the London disarmament conference to the people of the world. This is undoubtedly of great significance for raising the vigilance of the world's peace-loving people and strengthening the struggle for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The wise and realistic proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on February 18 is an extremely important contribution to promoting the disarmament and prohibition of atomic weapons that the people of the world desire. We, the Chinese people, along with the people of the world, firmly support the Soviet Union's sincere efforts to take realistic measures to consolidate peace.

    谁在为裁军谈判制造困难
    冯宾符
    苏联出席联合国裁军委员会小组委员会代表葛罗米柯，二十四日向记者发表谈话，用无可驳辩的事实揭穿了西方国家在伦敦裁军谈判中制造重重障碍，并企图把责任推到苏联头上的阴谋。这一揭露让全世界人民看清了事实的真相：究竟谁在阻挠裁减军备和禁止原子武器，谁在坚持不渝地为争取裁减军备和禁止原子武器这个保障世界和平的根本问题的协议而不懈努力。
    在联合国中，九年以来，始终存在着关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的两条路线：一条是苏联坚持不渝地为裁减军备、禁止原子武器并使原子能用于和平用途而努力；一条是以美国为首的西方国家一直对这个关系世界和平与安全的根本问题进行阻挠和怠工。联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的产生，是苏联和平政策的成就，也是苏联在一九五四年二月的柏林会议上一再坚持的成果。小组委员会的任务应该是再一次试图在关于裁减军备和武装部队以及关于禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的问题上达成协议。由于世界爱好和平人民要求裁军和禁止原子武器的强烈愿望的压力，以美国为首的西方国家不得不同意参加裁军小组委员会的工作。可是他们实际上感兴趣的不是真正裁减军备和禁止原子武器，而是继续军备竞赛和准备原子战争的“实力地位”政策，他们甚至想以裁军谈判作为幌子来掩饰进行不可告人的勾当。从西方国家代表在伦敦兰斯特大厦的工作过程中所表现的种种阻挠行为，完全证明了这一点。
    他们所制造的主要障碍之一，就是顽固地拒绝考虑在裁减军备和禁止原子武器方面所采取的措施的性质，却只要离开上述措施而把国际监督提到首要的地位。苏联的建议毫不含糊地指出，对实施一致同意的决定进行国际监督是同作出裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决定同样重要和必要的。西方国家却坚持首先建立一个国际监督机构，这个机构在第一阶段，即尚未实施禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施的时候，就拥有视察权。国际监督的目的为了什么？当然应该是为了裁减军备和禁止原子武器。不能设想，可以不谈裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施而空谈“国际监督”，那决不是什么对于裁减军备和禁止最危险武器的真正的监督，而只是为了美帝国主义侵略目的的巴鲁区方案的复活。大家都知道，所谓巴鲁区方案，就是企图在国际监督的伪装下，保证美国对于从事军事目标的原子能，不但在事实上掌握控制权，而且在法律上掌握监督权。一九四六年的巴鲁区方案早已破了产。现在是一九五五年。可是西方国家依旧回到了九年前的原来出发点。这说明了他们并不愿意认真地讨论裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及氢武器的问题。
    他们制造的另一主要障碍，就是反对苏联关于五大国大量裁减军备和部队的建议。他们口头上不能不同意五大国大量裁减军备。但他们却狡诈地企图用关于军备和武装部队的水平（数量）问题来代替关于裁减军备和武装部队的一致同意的定额的问题，以阻挠达成协议。事情很清楚：在规定裁减军备的定额的时候，必须根据各国相互间认为维持安全的合理的力量对比，包括人口、地理、经济和政治等因素，来确定标准，而决不能根据简单的算学观点。如果根据这种算学观点，就是连他们自己也承认，这样一来，在某种情况下，甚至可以有理由提出关于增加武装部队和军备的问题。由此可见，西方国家顽固地坚持这种行不通的算学观点，表明了他们根本不愿意结束军备竞赛，因为军备竞赛对于垄断资本攫取庞大利润是非常必要的。
    正是由于西方国家这种顽固阻挠的立场，以致自二月二十五日开始以来的伦敦兰斯特大厦的裁军谈判，至今没有取得什么成就。以美国为首的西方国家仍旧抱着阻挠达成关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的协议的老方针，一方面自己既不提建设性的新方案，一方面还对苏联一再谋求协议的诚恳努力千方百计地横施阻梗。不但如此，他们还不断发出迷惑国际舆论的言论，硬说小组委员会所遭到的困难是由于苏联的立场所造成，企图欺骗世人，把责任推到苏联的身上。
    但是事实不能抹煞。西方好战集团欺骗、诬蔑的阴谋是经不起放在光天化日之下的。大家都知道，当伦敦这次裁军谈判一开始，苏联就提出了积极的、切实可行的建议，主张销毁现储的原子武器和氢武器，不得增加军备、部队和军事拨款。由于美英法坚持反对的立场，苏联又于二月十八日提出了一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约的新建议。这个建议将法国和英国在一九五四年六月十一日提出的建议作为这一公约的基础。苏联新建议中除了包含关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器的国际公约的基本原则外，还提出了一项实行裁减军备的程序，规定开始只采取裁减常规军备的措施，以便于达成必要的谅解。这是一个建设性的前进的步骤。这个步骤表明了忠于和平的苏联，为了使人类免于苦难和灾害这个崇高的目的，总是不懈地争取达成大家能接受的协议。苏联这种为了和平的积极的现实的精神，可以说是仁至义尽的。
    战争与和平、诚意和恶意的两条路线的斗争，在伦敦兰斯特大厦的裁军谈判中表现得格外的鲜明。两种态度，两种目的，是泾渭判然，是非分明的。究竟谁在为伦敦裁军谈判制造困难，难道还不明白吗？
    事情越来越明显：坚持“实力政策”的人们到伦敦来谈判，是为了装装样子，企图欺骗迫切期望裁减军备和禁止原子武器的广大人民。这就是为什么当全世界密切期待的伦敦谈判刚要开始的时候，美国当政人士和美国的舆论就对达成协议的可能性故意散布悲观的气氛。这就是为什么当苏联光明正大地宣布其关于裁军的建议时，美英方面就仓皇失措，硬说什么“俄国人破坏了”小组委员会的“保密规则”。这就是为什么当裁军小组委员会由于他们的阻挠行动而越来越引起世界的群情愤激时，他们又颠倒黑白，散布谰言，企图证明阻挠达成协议的是苏联而不是他们！这也就是为什么当五国代表正在伦敦讨论裁军和禁止原子战争计划的时候，美英当政人物接连发出鼓吹原子战争的言论。
    葛罗米柯的谈话向全世界人民说明了伦敦裁军会议的实际情况。这对于提高世界爱好和平人民的警惕，加强为争取裁军和禁止原子武器而奋斗，无疑是有重要意义的。苏联在二月十八日所提出的明智的现实的建议，对于推动全世界人民所渴望的裁减军备和禁止原子武器更是一个极其重要的贡献。我们中国人民，和全世界人民一道，坚决支持苏联为了巩固和平而采取现实措施的真诚努力。
