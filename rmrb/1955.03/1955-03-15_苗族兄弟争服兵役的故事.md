    On February 13th, in the crowd seeing off the new recruits in Qingyan Town, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, a striking Miao youth named Tang Depei was present. Accompanied by his older brother Tang Deming, he happily joined the glorious ranks of defending the motherland.

    Just days before, these brothers had created a local sensation by vying for military service and refusing to yield to each other. As soon as the conscription order reached Qingyan Town, Tang Depei and Tang Deming, both filled with fervent enthusiasm to answer the nation's call and defend the motherland, secretly registered, each concealing their actions from the other and their family. It wasn't until one morning, when their father discussed the conscription with them, sincerely hoping that at least one of them would register, that they revealed their actions to each other.

    Both brothers had signed up, but the government could not allow them both to enlist at the same time. To secure the opportunity to serve first, they began trying to persuade each other. Tang Depei said to his older brother, Tang Deming, "You are a strong worker and can lead in production; you are also a militia squad leader, protecting the rear is also a glorious task. Let me go instead!" Tang Deming replied to his younger brother, "You are the only literate person in our agricultural production cooperative, able to write and calculate. You should stay and serve everyone!" He repeatedly pleaded, "Dear brother, you are only eighteen this year. After I complete my service and return home, you will still be of age to enlist. Let me go first this time!" But neither could convince the other. Therefore, Tang Depei privately asked his mother to agree to let him go first, guaranteeing, "I will bring honor to you just like the Miao hero Liu Xingwen." Tang Deming, on the other hand, ran around seeking officials to speak on his behalf. Their father, Tang Shaoyun, who had suffered greatly in the old society, was delighted to see his two sons competing to enlist. One day, the two brothers were arguing about enlisting in front of him again. Tang Shaoyun excitedly said to them, "As long as the military service bureau can take you, both of you should go and defend our happy life! We will run the agricultural production cooperative well at home and produce more grain to support you."

    Finally, Tang Depei was approved for enlistment. The dispute between the two brothers over military service was resolved. Tang Depei excitedly told the reporter, "We will never allow American imperialism to destroy our happy life again. Now that the opportunity to defend the motherland has arrived, of course, I want to be the first to enlist in the People's Liberation Army."

    苗族兄弟争服兵役的故事
    新华社记者　贺永丰
    二月十三日，在贵州省贵筑县青岩镇欢送应征新战士入伍的人流中，有一个令人注目的苗族青年唐德培。他在哥哥唐德明的陪同下，愉快地踏进了保卫祖国的光荣行列。
    就是这对亲弟兄，在几天以前因争服兵役互不相让，成为传遍全区的佳话。当征集补充兵员的命令刚传到青岩镇后，唐德培和唐德明都抱着积极响应国家号召和保卫祖国的最大热情，各自瞒着对方、瞒着家庭，争先去报了名。直到一个早上，他们的父亲向他们谈起征集补充兵员的事情，并且真诚地希望他们一定要去一个报名应征的时候，他们才互相讲出了自己已经报名的行动。
    兄弟两人都报名应征，可是政府是不能允许他们两人同时入伍的。兄弟两人为了争取自己能先服兵役，就互相做起说服工作来。唐德培对他的哥哥唐德明说：“你劳动强，能带头生产；你又是民兵分队长，保卫后方安定，也是光荣的事情。还是让我去吧！”唐德明就对弟弟说：“你是我们农业生产合作社内唯一识字的人，能写会算，你还是留下来为大伙服务吧！”并再三恳求说：“好弟弟，你今年才满十八岁，等我服役期满复员回家后，你还适合入伍的年龄哩。这次还是让我先去吧！”但是他们谁都说服不了谁。于是，弟弟唐德培就私自向母亲请求，一定要她答应先让他去，而且还保证说：“我会像苗族英雄刘兴文一样为你们增光的。”而哥哥唐德明就东奔西跑地去找干部代他说情。在旧社会受尽折磨的、他们的父亲唐绍云，见到两个儿子争相应征的情形，心里乐得很。一天，兄弟两人又在他面前争起应征的事情来；唐绍云就激动地对他们说：“只要兵役局能收你们，你们都去保卫我们的幸福生活吧！我们在家办好农业生产合作社，多打粮食来支援你们。”
    最后，弟弟唐德培终于被批准入伍了。两弟兄争服兵役的争论才得到解决。唐德培兴奋地对记者说：“我们决不容许美帝国主义再来破坏我们的幸福生活。现在，保卫祖国的机会到了，我当然要争先应征参加人民解放军。”
