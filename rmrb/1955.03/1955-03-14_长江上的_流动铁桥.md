The "Floating Iron Bridge" on the Yangtze River
By our reporters Zhen Weimin and Shi Yue'e

Facing the cold wind, we arrived at the Nanjing Ferry Operation Area. The "Nanjing" ferry had just arrived at the dock. On the deck of the ferry, three rails, each about seventy or eighty meters long, were laid flat. The trestle bridge, more than three zhang high and more than 190 meters long, stretched out from the land over the Yangtze River's rapids like a giant's arm, automatically rising and falling to connect with the ferry. At this time, the locomotives in the shunting yard roared, and twenty-four carriages had already passed through the trestle and onto the ship one after another. When we jumped on the ship and walked into the bright and clean wheelhouse, the "Nanjing" had slowly sailed away from the dock.

On the vast river surface, another ferry, the "Pukou," was slowly sailing from Pukou, carrying many carriages.

These two ships are the "Floating Iron Bridge" that connects the Jinpu and Huning Railways.

Before 1931, when the ferry was not yet built, the exchange of materials between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River all relied on wooden boats for piecemeal transshipment. One hundred and fifty civilian boats were used to transport goods back and forth every day, and each small boat could only carry one ton of goods per trip. All that could be seen was small boats coming and going on the river, and even a whole day's worth of transport didn't equal the carrying capacity of a single ferry trip. Now, the two ships only need thirteen and a half minutes per trip to ferry thousands of tons of vehicles and goods across the Yangtze River to the opposite bank. Passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai passenger train can still sleep, read, or play chess in their carriages, and safely cross the Yangtze River horizontally. If passengers don't look out the window at the turbulent river, they really won't know that the train has crossed the great river.

In the smoke-filled shunting yard of Pukou Station, materials such as steel from Anshan, timber from Jilin, and various types of machinery are waiting for the ferry to send them to the south of the Yangtze River to support the heavy and mechanical industries in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. And the freight trains that had just crossed the river carried various cotton textiles and light industrial products produced in Shanghai. There were also fresh, palatable fruits—oranges, bananas, sugarcane, lychees—transported in insulated cars from the distant Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, which were being transported by ferry to the northern plains.

The Nanjing Pukou Ferry was established in 1931. At that time, there was only one "Yangtze River" ship designed and manufactured by the British, which was destroyed during the War of Resistance Against Japan. During 1942 and 1943, the Japanese established the "Kinryo Maru" and "Pukou Maru" (i.e., the later "Nanjing" and "Pukou"), but after the Japanese surrendered, because the ferry was very profitable, the Kuomintang Jinpu and Jinghu Railway Bureaus often quarreled. The reactionary government's Ministry of Communications directly managed it, becoming a source of dirty political activities for the "ministers." The captains were all naval officers, and they lived a life of extravagance, often getting drunk and causing trouble, and implementing feudal rule over the crew. But in terms of production, they were very incompetent. Each time they set sail, they first had to have a tugboat hold the bow, and sometimes even use a tugboat to hold the stern, before the ship could leave the trestle bridge. Because the Kuomintang only knew how to use things and did not know how to maintain them, by the eve of liberation, the "Pukou" had been so badly damaged that its machinery was worn beyond limits and its hull was completely deformed. The "Nanjing" was looted by the Chiang bandits to Shanghai and sunk in the bottom of the Huangpu River.

After liberation, the ferry workers quickly restored the "Pukou" to navigation, and also sent more than twenty crew members to assist the shipbuilding workers in Shanghai to salvage and repair the "Nanjing." By May 1950, these two sister ferries were sailing on the Yangtze River again.

In 1951, with the recovery and development of the national economy, the flow of vehicles gradually increased. However, the "Pukou" was slow because its equipment was old, its horsepower was insufficient, and its steam pressure was too low, often delaying the "Nanjing." It was necessary to quickly repair the boiler flue of the "Pukou," but the heavy tasks at that time did not allow for stopping navigation for repairs. At this time, the fireman Zhao Dehai volunteered to drill into the hot furnace at a temperature of one hundred and forty degrees and high pressure, and only climbed out to rest for a while when he was dizzy from the smoke. This continued for three times, and finally eighteen flues were repaired. Later, the boiler flue broke seven times. Under the influence of Zhao Dehai's selfless labor spirit, other firemen also went in to repair it. They created a new method of rotating repairs, which improved the efficiency of repairs and ensured the normal navigation of the "Pukou."

In the early days of liberation, the Nanjing ferry could only operate a maximum of sixteen crossings per day and night. Later, it gradually increased to fifty-six crossings, and some people became complacent and thought that it was impossible to improve further. The leadership had no idea, so they let it go. At this time, Soviet expert Comrade Ruda came to the ferry and, after on-site inspection, believed that the ferry could operate at least eighty crossings per day and night. But at that time, people thought that it had always been the ship waiting for the car, and never the car waiting for the ship, so what was the point of increasing it to eighty crossings? The expert's suggestion was shelved, and the carrying capacity remained at around sixty crossings for as long as two years. It was not until near the end of 1953, when hundreds of vehicles were backlogged in the shunting yard and the Nanjing Transportation Bureau requested the ferry to increase to eighty crossings, that people dug out the expert's suggestion and implemented the method of fixing the straight航道 (course). This changed the past phenomenon of competing for courses, and the navigation indicator was reduced from fifteen and a half minutes to thirteen and a half minutes. At the same time, Xu Fengzao, the captain on duty of the "Nanjing," created a method of navigating in strong winds and heavy fog, which significantly reduced the navigation time and achieved the record of eighty crossings.

On December 13, 1953, a leading comrade from the Ministry of Railways came to the Nanjing Branch, praised the progress of the ferry since 1950, and called on and encouraged all employees to reach eighty-five crossings in 1953 and one hundred crossings in 1954 on the premise of ensuring safety. But on December 26, the ferry reached a record of eighty-six crossings in one day and night.

Everyone was studying the general task of the state during the transition period. One day, Lin Changfa, the captain on duty of the "Nanjing," visited the general line picture exhibition. He saw a picture that said: "Shortening the ferry's navigation indicator by one minute can increase the country's production by 7.3 billion yuan per year (old currency)." On the way out, he looked at his beloved stopwatch and thought about the relationship between this "one minute" and 7.3 billion yuan. In those days, when Lin Changfa was driving, he looked at the watch every time he made a move and calculated the time. The watch often told him that the entire navigation time was occupied by berthing time by one-third. The old rules for decades were to first align the bow with the outside of the pier, stop the hull with reverse gear, and then start the engine and engage the gear after the cable had pulled the ship close to the wooden frame. Now he felt that stopping and starting like this delayed navigation time. Only by changing the old method, aligning the bow with the center line of the trestle bridge, and engaging the gear without stopping, could the navigation time be shortened. Later, when he was on duty, he experimented with doing this several times.

In February 1954, the "Pukou" was about to enter the dock for major repairs, and the higher authorities requested the "Nanjing" to sail alone and complete forty-eight crossings per day and night. Lin Changfa already had ten records of sailing in ten minutes, breaking the navigation indicator by three and a half minutes, so the leadership sent technician Wang Kaijun and the trade union propaganda committee member to be responsible for verifying Lin Changfa's sailing operations. The cadres of the institute also used the Kovalev work method to summarize and supplement this straight-line entering method, and further trials were carried out on February 21, and the berthing method achieved multiple records of sailing in ten minutes. In April, the "Pukou" returned from its major repair, and Wang Baogui, the captain on duty of the "Pukou," observed Lin Changfa's operation, improved his own operation method, and shortened the navigation time of the "Pukou." Under the joint collaboration of various shifts and groups, the record of fifty crossings in twelve hours was achieved on the nights of September 17 and 18 respectively.

On the evening of September 24, 1954, when the ferry received a call from the Nanjing Zijinshan Observatory regarding the typhoon situation, a storm of level nine or above was already roaring on the river. Giant waves more than ten meters high rolled in the middle of the river, and the ferry tilted very badly. The leadership announced that the ferry would stop sailing. Red light signals were hung on the trestle bridges on both sides, and the two large ships dropped anchor and leaned against the north and south banks.

The storm had not stopped the next day. The workers on duty still came to the duty room and the sailors' room. The workers who were not on duty could not settle down at home, and often stepped out of the gate to listen to the sound of the wind and rain, waiting for the storm to stop. In this gap, the responsible comrades of the Nanjing Railway Sub-bureau came to the riverbank. They mobilized the masses to strive to complete the transportation task of one hundred crossings in the next busy working day. The sub-bureau leadership organized a large joint labor organization centered on the ferry, including the ferry, station, locomotive, train inspection, and telecommunications departments. Workers from various units held meetings and discussed their plans nervously. They looked at the dense trains backlogged in the Nanjing Station and Pukou Station shunting yards due to the one-day suspension of navigation, and became even more anxious. If the ferry did not resume navigation immediately, every hour the goods remained would be a loss.

The next morning, the wind force was around five or six, the water level still exceeded the highest historical record, the water flow was turbulent, and the slope of the trestle bridge was as high as 26%. But the platform near the dispatching office of the sub-bureau still issued a formal order to start navigation. When the time of the two rounds of navigation was formally calculated at 9:05, the wind and waves on the river were still above level six. In the engine room, the fire pumps of each boiler were burning particularly hard, and the drivers adopted Xu Fengzao's experience of navigating in strong winds and Lin Changfa's method of straight-line approach, and skillfully approached the opposite bank. Under the command of flashing red and green signals, one locomotive pulled eight carriages away, and another locomotive pushed eight carriages in. In this way, they linked one ring to another, the locomotives on the rails continuously picked up and delivered trains, the ferry in the heart of the river kept coming and going, and the trestle bridge automatically rose and fell with the load of the large ship. After twelve hours, the two ships had transported a total of fifty-two crossings, with an average navigation time of only twelve minutes. That day, a locomotive of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot suddenly broke a spring in the middle of the journey and could not pick up and deliver trains. According to the old rules, this situation had to be repaired in the depot, but at that time, the workers repaired the spring in only four minutes. That day, there were no obstacles in the line, signal, and electrical equipment, and millions of tons of goods were transported in one day and night. By 8:57 a.m. on September 26, one hundred and six crossings had been transported, the time was exactly one day and night, and the whistles of the ferry and the locomotive resonated several times. It seemed that they were saying: "We have overcome the wind and waves and created unprecedented transportation achievements."

According to the investigation records of the day, the ferry's navigation and the shunting operation areas on both sides still have a lot of potential to be tapped, and the workers are constantly working hard to continue to improve the transportation capacity.

    长江上的“流动铁桥”
    本报记者　甄为民　史月娥
    迎着扑面冷风，我们来到南京轮渡作业区。“南京号”渡轮刚到码头。渡轮的甲板上，平铺着三条约有七八十公尺长的铁轨。三丈多高、一百九十多公尺长的栈桥像巨人的臂膀一样，从陆地伸展在长江急流的上面，自动地升降，和渡轮衔接在一起。这时，调车场上机车轰鸣，二十四节列车已经通过栈桥先后上船。当我们跳上船，走到明净的驾驶室的时候，“南京号”已缓缓地开出了码头。
    在广阔的江面上，另一艘渡轮——“浦口号”，载着许多车厢从浦口慢慢驶行过来。
    这两艘船就是使津浦、沪宁铁路衔接起来的
  “流动铁桥”。
    在一九三一年以前，渡轮没有建成的时候，长江南北岸交流的物资全靠木船零星地驳运，每天用一百五十多只民船来回运货，每只小船一趟只能运一吨货，只见满江来来往往的小船，一天也运不到等于一艘渡轮一次的载重量。而现在两艘轮船每趟只要十三分半时间，就能把几千吨的车辆货物渡过长江对岸。北京到上海客车上的旅客，照旧在车上睡觉、看书或者下棋，就安稳地横渡长江。如果旅客不向窗外看看滔滔的江水，真不知火车已过大江去了。
    在浦口车站烟雾弥漫的调车场上，有来自鞍山的钢材，吉林的木材和各式机器等物资，正待渡轮送往江南去，支援上海、南京等地的重工业和机械工业。而刚才渡过江来的货物列车，有上海生产的各种棉纺织品、轻工业用品。还有装在保温车里的从遥远的广东、福建和浙江运来的甘美适口的新鲜水果——桔子、香蕉、甘蔗、荔枝，正在通过渡轮运往北方平原。

    南京浦口轮渡是一九三一年创建的，那时只有一艘英国人设计制造的“长江号”，在抗日战争中被毁。一九四二、四三年日本设制了“金陵丸”
  “浦口丸”（即后来的“南京号”和“浦口号”），日本投降后，因渡轮赢利很大，国民党津浦、京沪两铁路局常发生争吵，反动政府交通部就直接管理，成为“部长”们从事肮脏的政治活动的本钱。船长都是海军军官，他们过着花天酒地的生活，经常酗酒肇事，对船员实行封建统治。而在生产上他们却十分无能，每次开航时，先要拖轮拖住船头，有时还用一只拖轮拖住屁股，船才能开离栈桥。由于国民党只知使用，不知养护，到解放前夕，“浦口号”已被摧残得机械磨损过限，船身完全变形，“南京号”则被蒋贼劫掠到上海，炸沉在黄浦江底。
    解放以后，轮渡工人们一面迅速使“浦口号”复航，一面又派了二十多个船员，协助上海的造船工人，打涝和修理好了“南京号”，到一九五○年五月，这两艘姊妹渡轮又双双航行在长江上了。
    一九五一年，随着国家经济的恢复和发展，车流渐渐增多了。可是“浦口号”却因设备较旧，马力不足，汽压过低，航行速度很慢，常耽误对航的“南京号”。必须迅速动手修好“浦口号”的锅炉烟管，但当时繁重的任务不允许停航检修。就在这时，司炉长赵德海自告奋勇，在一百四十度高温和高气压下，奋身钻进了热炉子，被煤烟熏得头昏眼花的时候，才爬出来休息一会。这样连续了三次，终于把十八根烟管修好了。以后锅炉烟管曾坏了七次，在赵德海忘我劳动的精神影响下，别的司炉也进去修了，他们创造了轮流检修的新方法，提高了检修效率，保证了“浦口号”的正常航行。
    在解放初期，南京渡轮每昼夜最高只能对开十六渡，后来逐步能航行到五十六渡，有些人就自满起来，认为不可能再提高了。领导上心中无数，也就听之任之。这时候，苏联专家鲁达同志来到轮渡所，经过实地检查，他认为渡轮每昼夜至少能航行八十渡。但当时人们认为从来就是船等车，没有过车等船，要提高到八十渡干什么？专家的建议就被搁置起来，渡运能力就停止在六十渡左右达两年之久。直到一九五三年年关将近的时候，调车场积压了几百辆车子，南京运输分局要求渡轮提高到八十渡。这时人们才翻出了专家的建议，实行了固定走直线航道的办法，改变了过去互争航道的现象，航行指标由十五分半钟降到十三分半钟。同时，“南京号”值班船长徐凤早又创造了大风大雾中航行的办法，这就使得航行时间显著降低，达到了航行八十渡的纪录。
              ×　×　×
    一九五三年十二月十三日，铁道部一位领导同志来南京分局，表扬了渡轮自一九五○年以来的进步，号召和鼓励全体职工在保证安全的前提上，一九五三年达到八十五渡，一九五四年达到一百渡，可是就在十二月二十六日，渡轮就达到了一昼夜航行八十六渡的纪录。
    大家正在学习国家过渡时期的总任务。有一天，“南京号”值班船长林长发参观总路线图片展览会，他看到一张图片上写着：渡轮航行指标缩短一分钟，一年可为国家增产七十三亿元（旧币，下同）。在出来的路上，他看着自己心爱的秒表，心里想着这“一分钟”和七十三亿元的关系。那几天，林长发在驾驶时，每操纵一个动作他都要看一下表，计算计算时间，手表经常告诉他：全部航行时间却被靠岸时间占了三分之一。几十年来的老规矩都是先把船头对在墩架外面，把船身用倒车停住，等缆绳把船绞靠木架后，再起车进档。现在他觉得这样一停一起就耽误了航行时间。只有改变老方法，把船头对准栈桥中心线，不停车一直进档，一定能缩短航行时间。以后，他当班时，就试验着这样做过几次。
    一九五四年二月，“浦口号”马上要进坞大修，上级要求“南京号”单轮航行，每昼夜完成四十八渡任务。林长发已有十次航行十分钟的纪录，突破了航行指标三分半钟，领导上就派技术员王开钧和工会宣传委员来负责检定林长发开航作业。所里干部又用郭瓦廖夫工作法，总结和补充了这个直线进档法，并在二月二十一日作了进一步试行，靠岸方法又连获多次航行十分钟的纪录。四月里，“浦口号”大修回来了，“浦口号”值班船长王宝贵去观摩了林长发的操作，改进了自己的操作方法，缩短了“浦口号”的航行时间。在各班各小组共同协作下，九月十七日和十八日夜间，分别达到了十二小时航行五十渡的纪录。
            ×　×　×
    一九五四年九月二十四日晚上，轮渡所接到南京紫金山天文台的关于台风情况的电话时，九级以上的风暴已经在江面上怒吼了，江心卷起十多公尺高的巨浪，渡轮倾斜得十分厉害。领导上宣布渡轮停止航行，只见两岸栈桥上挂出了红灯信号，两艘大船下锚依靠在南北两岸。
    第二天风暴还没有停止。值班的工人照常来到值班室，水手室，不值班的工人在家里也安不下心，经常跨出大门听听风雨的声音，期待着风暴停止。在这一间隙中，南京铁路分局的负责同志来到了江边，他们动员群众争取在下一个紧张的劳动日争取完成一百渡的运输任务。分局领导上组织了以渡轮为中心的轮渡所、车站、机务、列检、电务等部门的一个大的联合劳动组织。各单位的工人纷纷集会紧张地讨论着自己的计划。他们看着因停航一天而积压在南京站、浦口站调车场上密密麻麻的列车，心里更加焦急，渡轮如果不马上复航，货物多停留一小时就是损失。
    次日早上，风力在五、六级左右，水位仍超出历史最高纪录，水流湍急，栈桥坡度高达百分之二十六，但分局调度室附近台仍发出正式开航的命令。到九时零五分，正式计算两轮航行时分时，江面上的风浪仍有六级以上。在机舱里每只锅炉的火泵都烧得特别足，驾驶员们采用了徐凤早的大风中航行的经验和林长发的直线进档方法，敏捷地驶近对岸。在一闪一闪的红绿信号指挥下，一台机车拖着八节列车走了，另一台机车又顶着八节列车来了。就这样，他们一环扣住一环，铁轨上机车连续的取送列车，江心渡轮来往不息，栈桥也跟着大船的载重量自动升降。到十二小时以后，两船一共渡运了五十二渡，平均航行时间只有十二分。那天，南京机务段的一台机车在中途突然断了弹簧，不能取送列车，照老规矩这种情况要进库修理，而当时工人只用四分钟时间就修好了弹簧。那天，线路、信号、电器设备也没有一点障碍发生，几百万吨货物在一昼夜间渡运一空。到九月二十六日上午八时五十七分时已运到一百零六渡，时间刚巧一昼夜，渡轮和机车的汽笛长长的共鸣了几声，它们好像在说：我们已战胜了风浪，创造了空前未有的渡运成绩。
    根据当天查定记录，渡轮航行和两岸调车作业区仍有不少潜力可以挖掘，工人们不断地在为继续提高渡运能力而努力。
