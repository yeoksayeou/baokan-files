    On the Attack on the Romanian Embassy in Switzerland from the Perspective of International Law
    Wang Tieya

    The attack on the Romanian People's Republic embassy in Bern, the capital of Switzerland, on February 14th by a group of armed fascist bandits has attracted attention. This incident is a clear violation of international law regarding diplomatic privileges and also seriously threatens normal diplomatic relations between countries.
     In the Swiss capital, fascist bandits, equipped with grenades, automatic weapons, and gas masks, broke into the Romanian embassy, injured embassy staff, and occupied the embassy for as long as thirty-eight hours. Such an attack on a foreign embassy occurring in the capital of a country with which diplomatic relations have been established and ambassadors have been mutually exchanged is shocking and unprecedented in the entire history of international law.
    The special rights and immunities granted to foreign diplomatic envoys by international law are among the oldest rules of international law. Early scholars of modern international law have consistently emphasized this rule, and the famous early international law scholar Vattel, who originated in Switzerland, emphasized the importance of foreign diplomatic envoys enjoying special rights from the perspective of establishing diplomatic relations between countries. Vattel said: "The same international law that makes a country accept foreign envoys also makes it necessary for the country to grant them all the rights necessary and guarantee the benefits of exercising their functions when accepting these envoys." Since the seventeenth century, this rule has been a completely established rule in international law, which is generally recognized today, and no country can violate it.
    The primary point of this rule is that foreign diplomatic envoys have inviolability. Inviolability is the most fundamental principle of the privileges of foreign diplomatic envoys; and inviolability requires the government of the receiving state to provide foreign diplomatic envoys with sufficient protection. As the French Pradier-Fodéré said: "Inviolability is absolute and complete security; it is obtaining the most stringent and effective protection." Another famous international law scholar from Switzerland, Bluntschli, also made the following provisions regarding the rights of foreign envoys in his "Draft International Law Code": "Envoys are inviolable," "The country where the envoys reside should not only not commit any violent acts against the envoys; but should also protect them from becoming the object of violence by its own residents"; "Any illegal injury to the person of an envoy is an injury to the country represented by the envoy; in serious circumstances, this act can be regarded as a crime against all countries and against general international law." However, the events that occurred on February 14th showed that Romanian envoys were violated in the Swiss capital. The fascist bandits who broke into the Romanian embassy aimed to violate the Romanian envoys; the atrocities of these bandits threatened the safety of the entire Romanian envoy.
    It should be pointed out that the inviolability of foreign envoys refers not only to the personal inviolability of the envoys but should also include the inviolability of the embassy premises. As Oppenheim of England explained: "The protection of diplomatic envoys should not be limited to his person alone, but must also extend to his family, entourage, official residence, furniture, vehicles, documents; and also to the privilege of communicating with his home country by letters, telegrams, and special messengers." Any international law scholar recognizes this; the draft of the International Law Association in 1929 on diplomatic privileges and immunities specifically pointed out that "the official residence of the head of the mission is inviolable," and it also believes that "the inviolability of the official residence extends to all places where the envoy resides or temporarily resides." The inviolability of embassy premises is not only necessary for the safety of the envoy himself but also an indispensable condition for any envoy to perform his duties. The attack on the Romanian embassy again showed that the inviolability of the Romanian embassy premises was also completely destroyed. Armed bandits not only broke into the embassy premises but also occupied the embassy, ​​effectively depriving the Romanian embassy of the minimum protection.
    It should also be pointed out that the fascist bandits' attack on the Romanian embassy also resulted in the death of an embassy driver due to injuries. The embassy driver belongs to the embassy staff, and the embassy staff is also inviolable and should be equally protected by the local country. As Oppenheim pointed out: "All members of the embassy are inviolable in the same way as the diplomatic envoy himself and enjoy extraterritoriality. This is a generally recognized rule of international law." The death of the embassy driver inside the embassy due to injuries caused by bandits is by no means an ordinary murder case but involves the destruction of the inviolability of embassy staff.
    Therefore, from all aspects, the attack on the Romanian embassy in Switzerland on February 14th was undoubtedly a serious violation of the rules of international law regarding diplomatic privileges enjoyed by diplomatic envoys.
    The Swiss government cannot but be held responsible for this incident. According to international law, the Swiss government, as the government of the receiving state, has an obligation to ensure the inviolability of foreign envoys and provide foreign envoys with sufficient protection. Moreover, the protection that the government of the receiving state provides to foreign envoys is not limited to the protection it provides to ordinary foreigners but should be special protection. The government of the receiving state should not only prohibit its own government personnel from arbitrarily violating foreign envoys but should also specifically protect foreign envoys from violation by anyone; it should not only prohibit its own government personnel from arbitrarily entering foreign embassies but should also prevent anyone from attempting to break into foreign embassies. International law requires the government of the receiving state to provide all necessary measures to provide foreign envoys with special protection. The Swiss government obviously did not meet the requirements of international law for this incident and did not fulfill the obligations it should have fulfilled.
    The occurrence of the incident indicates that the Swiss government did not take the necessary measures to prevent it in advance. The fact that the fascist bandits broke into the Romanian embassy with equipment such as grenades, automatic weapons, and gas masks indicates an organized and planned activity. Whether these bandits crossed the border or were organized locally, it would not have been difficult for any effective government to detect them. The fact that the Swiss authorities did not discover such bandits, or discovered them but did not stop them, is it not sufficient to prove that the Swiss government at least did not pay enough attention to the protection of the safety of foreign envoys? Not only that, but after the incident occurred, the Swiss government also failed to take the necessary measures immediately to arrest the criminals who broke into the embassy and restore the status of the embassy. This is also sufficient to prove that the Swiss government did not fulfill its obligation to protect foreign envoys. Moreover, after repeated requests from responsible embassy personnel, the local police authorities delayed taking concrete measures, causing the fascist bandits to occupy the embassy for a long period of time, making it impossible to treat the injured embassy driver in time, leading to his death; this is also a responsibility that the Swiss government cannot shirk.
    Since the Swiss government should be held responsible for this incident, which seriously violates the rules of international law regarding diplomatic privileges, it must seriously deal with all the problems arising from the incident in accordance with the provisions of international law. It must severely punish the criminal fascist bandits and, if necessary, extradite them to the Romanian government for punishment according to law; it must compensate the Romanian embassy and embassy staff for the damage and losses suffered; it must also take the necessary measures to fully restore the diplomatic privileges of the Romanian embassy. This is required by international law and also required by normal diplomatic relations between countries.

    从国际法上论罗马尼亚驻瑞士使馆被袭击事件
    王铁崖
    二月十四日罗马尼亚人民共和国在瑞士首都伯尔尼的公使馆被一群武装的法西斯匪徒所袭击的事件引起人们的注意。这个事件显然是违反国际法上关于外交特权的规则的，同时它也严重地威胁着国家和国家之间的正常外交关系。
     在瑞士首都，法西斯匪徒居然带着手榴弹、自动武器和防毒面具等装备，冲进罗马尼亚公使馆的房屋，伤害使馆的人员，而且占领使馆达三十八小时之久。这样的袭击外国使馆的事件发生在邦交已经建立而且彼此已经互派使节的国家的首都，不能不是骇人听闻的，在整个国际法的历史上也是前所未见的。
    外国外交使节享有国际法所赋予的特殊权益和辖免是国际法的最古老的规则之一。近代国际法的早期学者曾经一致强调这一规则，而瑞士自己所产生的一个有名的早期国际法学者法泰尔就曾从国家和国家之间建立外交关系的方面着重说明外国外交使节享有特殊权益的重要性。法泰尔说过：“使国家接受外国使臣的同一国际法，也就使国家必须在接受这些使臣时给予其所必要的一切权利和保证其行使职务的权益。”自从十七世纪以来，这个规则已经是国际法上完全确立的规则，在今天也是一般所承认的，任何国家不能违反。
    这个规则之中，首要一点是外国外交使节具有不可侵犯性。不可侵犯性是外国外交使节的特权中最基本的原则；而不可侵犯性也就要求驻在国政府给予外国外交使节以足够的保护。法国普拉迪—佛得烈说得好：“不可侵犯性就是绝对的和完全的安全；就是获得最严密的和最有效的保护。”瑞士自己所产生的另一个著名国际法学者伯伦智理在他的
  “国际法典草案”中对于外国使节的权利也曾经作这样的规定：“使节是不可侵犯的”，“使节驻在的国家不仅应该不对使节作任何强暴行为；而且应该保护他们不致成为本国居民的强暴的对象”；“对于使节人身的任何非法伤害就是对于使节所代表的国家的伤害；在严重情形之下，这种行为可以视为对于一切国家以及对于一般国际法的罪行。”但是，二月十四日发生的事件表明，罗马尼亚的使节在瑞士首都是被侵犯了。冲入罗马尼亚使馆的法西斯匪徒是以侵犯罗马尼亚使节为其目的；这些匪徒的暴行威胁了整个罗马尼亚使节的安全。
    应该指出，外国使节的不可侵犯性不仅指着使节人员的人身不可侵犯，还应该包括使馆房屋的不可侵犯。英国奥本海说明过：“对外交使节的保护，不应仅只限于他本人的人身，同时也必须及于他的家属、随员、官邸、家具、车辆、文件；而且还及于经由函件、电报及特别信差与其本国通讯的特权。”任何国际法学者都承认了这一点；国际法学会一九二九年关于外交特权和辖免的草案就特别指出，“使节首长的官邸是不可侵犯的”，它还认为，“官邸的不可侵犯性扩展及使节所居住或暂时居留的一切地方”。使馆房屋的不可侵犯不仅是使节本身安全所必要，也是任何使节执行其职务所不可缺少的条件。罗马尼亚使馆被袭击的事件又表明罗马尼亚使馆房屋的不可侵犯性也被彻底破坏了。武装的匪徒不仅冲入使馆的房屋，而且占领了使馆，使罗马尼亚使馆在事实上失去了最低限度的保护。
    还应该指出，法西斯匪徒袭击罗马尼亚使馆还使一位使馆司机因被伤害而致死亡。使馆司机属于使馆人员，而使馆人员也是不可侵犯的，应该同样受当地国家的保护。正如奥本海所指出的：“使馆的一切人员都与外交使节本人一样是不可侵犯的，享有治外法权的。这是国际法上大家公认的一条规则。”使馆司机在使馆内被匪徒伤害致死，绝不是普通的杀人案件，而是涉及破坏使馆人员的不可侵犯性的。
    因此，从各方面说来，二月十四日罗马尼亚驻瑞士使馆被袭击，无疑是严重破坏国际法上关于外交使节享受外交特权的规则的事件。
    对于这个事件，瑞士政府是不能不负责任的。依照国际法，作为驻在国政府的瑞士政府有义务保证外国使节的不可侵犯性，给予外国使节以足够的保护。并且，驻在国政府对于外国使节的保护不限于它给予普通外国人的保护，而应该是特殊的保护。驻在国政府不仅应该禁止其自己的政府人员任意侵犯外国使节，而且应该特别保护外国使节不受任何人的侵犯；它不仅应该禁止其自己的政府人员任意进入外国使馆，而且应该阻止任何人闯入外国使馆的企图。国际法要求驻在国政府必须提供为给予外国使节以特殊保护所必要的一切措施。瑞士政府对于这个事件显然就没有达到国际法的要求，没有担负它所应担负的义务。
    事件的发生指明，瑞士政府没有采取必要的措施，事先加以防止。法西斯匪徒带着手榴弹、自动武器和防毒面具等装备冲进罗马尼亚使馆，是有组织的和有计划的活动。这些匪徒不论是越边境而进来抑即在当地组织起来的，是任何有效的政府所不难发现的。对于这样的匪徒，瑞士当局竟然没有发现，或者有所发现而不加以阻止；这难道不足以证明瑞士政府至少是对于外国使节安全的保护没有给予足够的注意吗？不仅如此，在事件发生之后，瑞士政府也没有立即采取必要的措施，逮捕冲进使馆的罪犯，恢复使馆的地位。这又足以证明瑞士政府没有履行其保护外国使节的义务。而且，经过使馆负责人员一再要求，而当地警察当局还延迟不采取具体措施，以致法西斯匪徒长时期占领使馆，使已受伤害的使馆司机无法救治而死亡；这也是瑞士政府所无法推托其责任的。
    瑞士政府既然对于这个严重破坏国际法上关于外交特权的规则的事件应该担负责任，它就必须按照国际法的规定认真处理事件所引起的一切问题。它必须严厉惩罚犯罪的法西斯匪徒，在必要时引渡给罗马尼亚政府依法惩办；它必须补偿罗马尼亚使馆以及使馆人员所受的损害损失；它也必须作必要的措施以完全恢复罗马尼亚使馆的外交特权。这是国际法所要求的，也是国家和国家之间的正常外交关系所要求的。
