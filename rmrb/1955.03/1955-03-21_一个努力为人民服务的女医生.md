    A Female Doctor Who Strives to Serve the People
    By our correspondent Bai Sheng
    A female patient named Dong Li, three months pregnant, suddenly experienced uterine bleeding and felt very unwell. She immediately went to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for examination and treatment. After an examination in the outpatient clinic, a papilloma was found on her cervix. A pathological biopsy at the time proved it to be a tumor with malignant changes. The patient and her husband were very anxious and distressed. They had been married for six years and had been hoping for a child. But now all hope was about to be dashed. The malignant tumor on the cervix not only meant that the child could not be saved, but also that the mother's life was in danger. If handled in the usual way, it would have been necessary to remove the uterus immediately. However, after diagnosis by Dr. Lin Qiaozhi, the director of obstetrics and gynecology, she disagreed with such a hasty decision. She thought that this was a patient who was about to become the mother of her first child, and that the mother was so eager to see a lovely child. If the uterus were removed, the doctor could naturally feel relieved, but the patient would never have the opportunity to have children. She felt that a doctor had a responsibility to find more ways and make greater efforts to relieve people's suffering and increase their happiness. So she considered it again and again, and repeatedly studied the condition, to see if the so-called "malignant tumor" was absolutely certain. Her high sense of responsibility to the patient and her rich clinical experience finally helped her to discover that there were more reasons to believe that this condition might be a special change of a benign tumor during pregnancy. Therefore, she resolutely decided to closely observe the development of the condition. Unless it was completely confirmed that it was necessary, she would never easily perform surgery on the patient. In this way, the fetus still had a chance to survive, and at the same time, the mother would not be in danger. After making this decisive decision, she kept in contact with the patient frequently, observing and studying repeatedly and patiently. After a period of time, the situation was good. Finally, when the fetus was mature enough to live outside the mother's body, she performed a cesarean section for the patient to remove the child. Facts proved that her observation and treatment were completely correct. After the patient and the newborn baby left the hospital happily and safely, the patient's husband wrote a letter of gratitude:
    "Dr. Lin: Thank you and all the doctors for your special care, which freed me from the distress of life and gave me a new family happiness! … Your serious and cautious attitude in medicine deeply moved us and gave me great enlightenment. We decided to name our child 'Guan Nianlin' to commemorate you forever."
    A very adorable photo of this child, named Guan Nianlin, is now kept in Dr. Lin Qiaozhi's hands. But this is just one of the many photos of children that Dr. Lin has saved. Dr. Lin has saved countless children and mothers with her hard work, and has brought happiness to countless families. Therefore, many people write letters and send photos to thank her.
    Dr. Lin Qiaozhi's hair is now gray, but her spirit is even more radiant and vigorous. She often carefully examines patients in the outpatient clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and some young doctors often gather around her, intently learning her diagnostic and treatment experience. While working, she tells these young doctors about various medical issues, passing on her rich medical knowledge and practical experience to the younger generation. She is the most famous obstetrician and gynecologist in our country with more than 20 years of clinical medical experience, but she never prides herself on her rich medical knowledge and experience. She treats everyone's suffering as if it were her own, and tries every means to relieve it. She feels that this is her responsibility to the country and the people. Her high sense of responsibility enables her to forget all her hardships. People can often see that it has been a long time after work, but as long as her work is not finished, she never leaves the hospital immediately. Sometimes she goes back to her dormitory and sleeps, but in the middle of the night, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology calls again, saying that a patient with a particularly difficult labor or an emergency has arrived and needs her personal guidance or surgery. She never complains about these sudden requests. Regardless of wind, cold, rain or snow, she immediately goes to the hospital. Sometimes other hospitals ask her to consult on difficult and complicated cases, and she never finds it troublesome, always picking up her bag and leaving.
    She not only undertakes the work of outpatient clinics and wards, but also undertakes the teaching tasks of the medical school, and often leads the teaching and scientific research work of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The busyness and tension of her work bring her not irritability, but joy. Her life is full of the love for her profession and the endless power in her work that a doctor who strives to serve the people should have.
    Dr. Lin Qiaozhi, who was spiritually bound for a long time in the old Peking Union Medical College under the rule of American imperialism, is able to work so happily and be full of a spirit of continuous progress today, partly because she has an infinite love for her motherland and people, and also because the Party and the People's Government have shown her deep concern and continuous education, which has enabled her to gradually understand many principles and improve her political consciousness.
    When Beijing was liberated in the early days, when she had not yet realized the nature of this great historical event, she only thought that this was another simple "dynastic change." She could not understand why people were so jubilant and played gongs and drums when the People's Liberation Army entered the city. When the whole nation was celebrating the founding ceremony, she only looked at the parade on the street from the glass window of "Peking Union Medical College" and did not feel any shock in her heart. However, as time went on, she finally saw a series of extraordinary new things: prices, which had been impossible to control for more than ten years, were actually stable; people everywhere were engaged in intense labor and learning, trying to build their motherland better; the staff of the Communist Party and the People's Government also did not have the bureaucratic habits of the old era, and their lives were very simple. These many facts made her question and began to feel that this government was indeed different from the previous governments, and that the Communist Party was indeed different from the parties of the old era. She saw that the politics brought by the Communist Party was indeed a good politics, and that the Communist Party was indeed great and correct. But she still could not understand what relationship there was between politics and science. She thought: "We can't control politics, so let's be a doctor and do our duty. Anyway, politics is for specialists to do." At the same time, she also felt that: the Communist Party could not do science either, science was not their business. In a word: politics is politics, science is science. If you want to talk about science, she felt that the United States was better.
    When the ideological remolding movement was vigorously carried out in the Peking Union Medical College, the Party clearly put forward the slogan of "Anti-Imperialism and Patriotism." At that time, her thinking was still very vague, and she could not clearly understand why the United States should be called an imperialist country and an aggressor country. "Isn't the United States giving us money to run schools, run hospitals, train senior experts, and improve the level of science?" After the Party's patient enlightenment and education, she gradually realized from general principles that the United States was an imperialist country, but she always felt that the United States' "running schools" and "running hospitals" in China could not be considered a bad thing, and could not be called aggression. It was not until she saw the various despicable and dirty harmful activities carried out by the so-called "experts" and "scholars" of the United States in China that she fundamentally woke up. In the exhibition of accusing American imperialism of its crimes of cultural aggression in "Peking Union Medical College", she saw the bacterial research and experiments carried out by the "experts" and "scholars" of American imperialism, which were not for saving people, but for killing people! In order to cultivate deadly germs that kill people without bloodshed, they even tied boxes filled with lice on orphans and poor laborers, letting the lice suck human blood and transmit germs! American imperialists even attempted to conduct artificial insemination on Chinese women using sperm suspensions of various acidity levels from mammals in clinical trials in obstetrics and gynecology! These many inhumane so-called "scientific experiments" greatly stimulated her. She painfully thought: if American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique continue to rule China, what path and direction will China's science develop along? Science was originally for the benefit of mankind, but now it is being used to harm mankind and murder mankind! Who are the friends of science and scientists, and who are the enemies of science and scientists, she now saw.
    Soon after, at the exhibition of crimes of American imperialism conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, she saw another series of bloody facts. The conscience, sense of justice, and enthusiasm for the pursuit of truth of scientists deeply moved her, and she began to hate American imperialism, despise and antagonize American imperialism! She began to ask to study politics, and from the bottom of her heart, she admitted that science and politics have an inseparable relationship, and admitted that scientists cannot be separated from politics. She wanted to use science as a weapon to oppose imperialism and build and defend her motherland. She began to feel the warmth and kindness of her motherland more deeply. She began to learn how to consider problems from the standpoint of the Chinese people, and no longer felt that the Communists' view of American imperialism was prejudice. She felt that she was wrong before, not the Communist Party. She seriously criticized her past thinking of not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and determined to be a scientist of the people.
    When the Party sent her capable assistants to help her manage and plan daily administrative work in order to help her do a good job in medical treatment and scientific research, so as not to make her overly laborious and distracted, she was even more deeply moved. She felt that only the Communist Party truly understands the value of science and scientists, and only the Communist Party truly cares about the growth and development of science and scientists. She thought that although she also loved the doctor's career in the past, that kind of love was based on individualism; but today it is different, she feels that her career has been linked to the career of the Party and the people. So she loves her doctor's career even more, and is determined to contribute her strength completely to her motherland and people. A sense of being the master of the country, which she had never had before, now appears in her mind. Her concern and care for patients is no longer just to comfort her personal conscience, but to add a force to the construction cause of the motherland. She feels that this force is closely related to the future of the entire country and the entire human race.
    In 1953, she accepted the entrustment of the Chinese people to go to Vienna to participate in the World Medical Conference, and visited the Soviet Union for a period of time, which gave her another vivid socialist education. After returning to China, she actively disseminated advanced Soviet medical ideas in the Peking Union Medical College. With the love and trust of the people of the motherland, she was honorably elected as a representative of the National People's Congress and a member of the National Democratic Women's Federation, and she enthusiastically participated in these social and political activities. Her selfless hard work and socialist awakening have established a new work spirit in the Peking Union Medical College. The hard work she has put in at her doctor's post will bring more happiness to the people of our country, especially mothers and children, and will bring more useful knowledge and experience to the younger generation of medical workers in our country. In the great socialist construction cause of our country, she will continue to make new contributions.

    一个努力为人民服务的女医生
    本报记者　柏生
    一个叫做董莉的女病人，怀孕三个月了，忽然子宫出血，身体感到非常不适，她立刻到中国协和医学院附属医院妇产科来请求检查和医治。经门诊检查，发现子宫颈有乳头状瘤，当时经病理切片化验，证明这是个瘤子，并有恶性病变。病人和病人的丈夫都非常焦急，难过。那时她们夫妇俩结婚已经六年，一直没有小孩，都盼望能有一个孩子。但现在一切希望都要幻灭了。子宫颈生了恶性瘤，不仅孩子不可能保存，就是母亲的生命也很危险。当时假如按照一般的处理，需要立即切除子宫。但是最后经过妇产科主任林巧稚大夫诊断，她不同意这样草率决定。她想，这是一个将要作第一个孩子的母亲的病人，而这位母亲又是那么迫切地期望看到一个可爱的孩子。如果切除了子宫，医生自然可以安心了，但是病人就永远没有机会生育了。她觉得一个医生有责任想出更多的办法，用更大的努力来为人们解除病苦，增加幸福。于是她就再三考虑，反复研究病情，看所谓“恶性瘤”是不是十分肯定的。她对病人的高度责任感和她的丰富的临床经验最后帮助了她，使她发现有更多的理由可以认为这个病情可能是一种良性肿瘤在怀孕期的特殊变化，于是她毅然决定严密观察病情的发展。除非完全证实确有必要时，绝不轻易给病人作手术。这样胎儿就还有希望活下去，同时母亲也不致发生危险。这样果断地决定以后，她就经常和病人保持着联系，不厌其烦地反复观察，研究。经过一段时期，情况良好。最后当胎儿已经成熟，可以脱离母体生活时，她为病人进行了剖宫取子的手术。事实证明她的观察和处理是完全正确的。当病人和初生的婴儿幸福地和安全地离开医院以后，病人的丈夫热情地写来了感激的信：
    “林大夫：感谢您和各位大夫格外的关照，使我脱离开人生的苦恼，从新获得了家庭的幸福！……您在医学上认真和慎重的态度，深深地感动了我们，给了我很大的启示，我们决定把我们的孩子叫作‘关念林’来纪念您到永远。”
    这个叫作关念林的孩子，现在有一张非常可爱的照片保存在林巧稚大夫的手中。但这只是林巧稚大夫所保存的许多孩子照片中的一张。林大夫曾经用自己辛勤的劳动救活过许许多多的孩子和母亲，给许许多多的家庭带来过幸福。因此写信和寄照片来感谢她的人也非常多。
    林巧稚大夫现在头发已经斑白，但她的精神却更加焕发，更加旺盛。她常在协和医院妇产科的门诊室里仔细地给病人检查病情，一些年轻的医生时常围在她的身旁，聚精会神地学习着她的诊断和治疗经验。她一面工作，一面就给这些年轻医生讲述有关医疗的各种问题，把自己丰富的医学知识和实践经验传授给年轻人。她是具有二十多年临床医学经验的我国最著名的妇产科专家，但是她从来不因自己有丰富的医学知识和经验而骄傲，她对任何人的病苦都像对于自己的病苦一样，要想尽一切办法来解除。她觉得这是自己对国家和人民所应负的责任。她的高度的责任感，使她能够忘却自己的一切辛苦。人们经常可以看到：过了下班时间已经很久了，但是只要她的工作还没有完，她从不马上就离开医院。有时夜晚她回到宿舍里睡了，可是夜半妇产科又来了电话，说是来了特殊难产的病人或是急症的病人，必需她亲自指导或亲自动手术。对于这些突然来的要求，她从来没有怨言。不管风寒雨雪，立即到院。有时别的医院请她去会诊疑难病症，她也从来不嫌麻烦，总是拿起提包来就动身。
    她不仅担负着门诊和病房的工作，还担负着医学院的教学任务，要经常领导妇产科教研室的教学和科学研究工作。工作的繁忙和紧张，带给她的并不是烦躁，而是愉快。在她的生活中，充满了一个努力为人民服务的医生所应该具有的那种对自己职业的热爱和工作中无穷无尽的力量。
    曾经在美帝国主义统治下的旧协和医学院精神上长期被束缚的林巧稚大夫，今天所以能够工作得这样愉快，充满前进不息的精神，一方面是因为她对自己的祖国和人民具有无限的热爱，同时也因为经过党和人民政府对她的深切关怀和不断的教育，使她逐步地认清了许多道理，提高了政治的自觉。
    当北京解放初期，她还没有意识到这个巨大历史事变的性质的时候，她只以为这又是一次单纯的“改朝换代”。她不能理解解放军入城时人们为什么那样欢欣鼓舞，锣鼓喧天。开国大典时全国人民都在热烈欢庆，她只从“协和”的玻璃窗里看看街上的游行队伍，心里不觉得有什么震动。但是，时间过得久了，她终于看到了一连串不平凡的新鲜事物：十多年一直无法控制的物价，居然平稳了；人们到处都在进行紧张的劳动和学习，要把自己的祖国建设得更好；共产党和人民政府的工作人员，也没有旧时代的官僚习气，生活非常朴素。这许多事实都使她发生了疑问，使她开始感到这个政府的确和以前的政府不同，共产党的确和旧时代的党派不同。她看到了共产党所带来的政治的确是一种好的政治，共产党的确是伟大的和正确的。但是她还不能理解政治同科学有什么关系。她想：“政治，咱们管不着，安分守己当自己的医生吧。反正政治是有专门人干的。”同时她还觉得：共产党也搞不了科学，科学不是他们的事。一句话：政治是政治，科学是科学。要谈科学的话，她觉得还是美国的好。
    当思想改造运动在中国协和医学院蓬勃地开展起来的时候，党明确地提出了“反帝爱国”的口号。当时她的思想还很模糊，她还不能清楚地认识为什么美国要被称为帝国主义国家和侵略国家。“美国不是拿钱帮我们办学、办医，培养高级专家，提高科学水平吗？”经过党对她的耐心启发和教育，她逐渐从一般道理上认识了美国是帝国主义国家，但她总觉得美国在中国“办学”、“办医”不能算坏事，不能称作侵略。一直到她看到美国的所谓“专家”和“学者”在中国所进行的各种卑鄙龌龊的害人勾当时，她才从根本上清醒过来。在控诉美帝国主义在“协和”进行的文化侵略罪行展览会上，她看到了美帝国主义的“专家”和“学者”所进行的细菌研究和试验，原来并非为了救人，而是为了杀人！他们为了培育杀人不见血的毒菌，竟至在孤儿们和穷苦的劳动人民的身上绑上装虱子的匣子，让虱子吮吸人的血液，传染病菌！美帝国主义分子甚至企图在妇产科的临床试验上，用哺乳类动物的精子作各种酸度的悬液，在中国妇女身上进行人工授精！这许多灭绝人性的所谓“科学试验”，使她受到很大的刺激。她痛苦地想到：如果让美帝国主义和蒋介石集团继续统治中国，中国的科学将会沿着什么道路、向着什么方向发展呢？科学原来是为人类谋幸福的，现在却被拿来残害人类、谋杀人类了！谁是科学和科学家的朋友，谁是科学和科学家的敌人，现在她看到了。
    不久以后，在美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的罪行展览会上，她又看到了一连串的血淋淋的事实。科学家的良心、正义感和追求真理的热忱使她深深激动，她开始痛恨美帝国主义，鄙视和敌视美帝国主义！她开始要求学习政治，从心底里承认科学和政治有着不可分离的关系，承认科学家不能脱离政治。她要用科学作为武器来反对帝国主义，建设和保卫自己的祖国。她开始更加深切地感觉到祖国的温暖和亲切。她开始学习怎样站在中国人民的立场上来考虑问题，再不感觉到共产党人对美帝国主义的看法是偏见。她觉得以前是自己错了，不是共产党错了。她认真地批判了自己过去敌我不分的思想，决心做一个人民的科学家。
    当党为了帮助她搞好医疗和科学研究工作，给她派了得力的助手帮她管理和计划日常行政工作，不使她过分操劳分神时，她更深深感动。她感觉到只有共产党才是真正懂得科学和科学家的价值的，只有共产党才是真正关怀科学和科学家的成长和发展的。她想到自己过去虽然也热爱着医生的事业，但那种热爱是建立在个人主义的基础上；而今天已经不同了，她感到自己的事业已经同党和人民的事业联系起来了。于是她更加热爱她的医生事业，决心把自己的力量完全贡献给自己的祖国和人民。以前从来没有过的一种国家主人翁的感觉，现在在她的头脑中显现出来。她对病人的关切和爱护，已经不只是为了安慰个人的良心，而是为了给祖国的建设事业增加一分力量。她觉得这一分力量对于整个国家和整个人类的前途都有密切关系。
    一九五三年她接受了中国人民的委托，到维也纳去参加世界医学会议，并且在苏联参观了一个时期，这又使她受到了一次生动的社会主义教育。回国以后，她积极地在中国协和医学院传播了先进的苏联医学思想。在祖国人民的热爱和信任下，她光荣地当选了全国人民代表大会代表和全国民主妇联委员，她热情地参加了这些社会政治活动。她的忘我的辛勤劳动和社会主义的觉醒，在中国协和医学院里树立起一种新的工作精神。她在自己的医生岗位上所付出的辛勤劳动，将给我国人民特别是母亲和儿童带来更多的幸福，将给我国青年一代的医务工作者带来更多的有用知识和经验。在我们祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业中，她将不断地作出新的贡献。
