Xinhua News Agency, March 13th—People's Committees and Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in various provinces are rapidly transmitting the policy of fixed grain production, purchase, and sale to the rural areas. Since the beginning of this month, the People's Committees and Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Guangxi, and other provinces have held meetings to convey the relevant instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. They have determined the grain increase production and grain unified purchase and sale tasks for their respective provinces in 1955 and have arranged for specific measures to rapidly transmit the policy of fixed grain production, purchase, and sale to the rural areas. At these meetings, it was decided to dispatch a large number of cadres, led by the main responsible cadres of the Provincial People's Committees and Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party, to assist the governments and Communist Party organizations at all levels in the rural areas to assign this year's grain purchase and sale tasks to the townships. These cadres would announce the tasks to the vast number of farmers and, through checking the preparations for spring plowing production and rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations, rapidly launch the spring plowing production movement.

Guangdong Province, which has the earliest spring plowing season in China, has had the work of fixing grain production, purchase, and sale assigned to governments and Party committees at all levels by the Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the latter half of last month. At present, this work is being carried out in the rural areas throughout the province. Most provinces will gradually implement it to the townships from the middle to the end of this month. More than 500 cadres drawn from provincial-level organs in Henan Province are studying the State Council's resolution on spring plowing production and relevant policies on grain work and mutual aid and cooperation. More than 3,000 cadres drawn by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee will go to the countryside within days, and one-half of the cadres above the section level in Hubei Province's provincial-level organs will be drawn to go to the countryside.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 13th—The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has combined spring plowing and community rectification work to arrange for the province's grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale" work. At present, the Party organizations and People's Committees of various counties are drafting plans for grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale" indicators for each township and are preparing to convene meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels or county people's congresses for discussion and research in order to rapidly convey them to the farmers.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conveyed and arranged the grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale" work at the provincial spring plowing and community rectification meeting, requiring Party organizations at all levels to combine the grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale" work with spring plowing and community rectification to convey and arrange downward. It also pointed out: Only by combining the grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale" work with spring plowing and community rectification, mobilizing farmers to calculate how much grain the whole township produces, sells, and retains, and then checking the preparation work for realizing grain production increase and studying the methods for realizing production increase, can we effectively promote agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and all farmers to do a good job in the current spring plowing production, and further consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Taiyuan, the Party Committees at all levels in Shanxi Province are taking various measures to rapidly convey the policy of implementing fixed production, purchase, and sale of grain to the rural areas. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting on March 7 to discuss this year's provincial grain unified purchase and sale tasks and measures and steps for implementing the "three fix" policy. The local committees of the Chinese Communist Party are currently holding meetings of the main cadres of each county to make more specific research and arrangements. It is expected that this work will be assigned to the villages by the 25th of this month.

In order to rapidly and widely convey the significance and role of fixed production, purchase, and sale of grain to the farmers and mobilize farmers to actively carry out spring plowing production, Party committees at all levels throughout the province will mobilize more than one million cadres, people's representatives, and propagandists to participate in work teams and carry out various forms of propaganda activities.

    各省领导机关积极采取具体措施
    贯彻粮食定产定购定销政策
    【新华社十三日讯】各省人民委员会和中共省委正把粮食的定产、定购、定销政策迅速传达到农村中去。本月上旬以来，江苏、山东、湖南、湖北、河南、山西、河北、辽宁、黑龙江、陕西、广西等省的人民委员会、中共省委连日召开会议，传达国务院和中共中央有关指示，确定一九五五年度本省粮食增产和粮食统购、统销任务，布置把粮食的定产、定购、定销政策迅速传达到农村去的具体措施。这些会议上，都决定派出大批干部，由省人民委员会和中共省委主要负责干部带领下乡，协助农村中各级政府和共产党的组织，把今年度粮食购、销任务分配到乡，迅速向广大农民宣布，同时通过检查春耕生产准备工作和整顿互助合作组织等工作，把春耕生产运动迅速开展起来。
    我国春耕季节最早的广东省，粮食定产、定购、定销工作已由省人民委员会和中共省委在上月下旬向各级政府和党委布置，目前这个工作已在全省农村中进行。大部分省在本月中旬到月底，都将陆续贯彻到乡。河南省省级机关抽调的五百多名干部，正在学习国务院关于春耕生产的决议和有关粮食工作、互助合作的政策。江苏省委已抽调的三千多名干部日内就要下乡，湖北省省级机关科级以上的干部将有二分之一人数抽调下乡。
    【新华社保定十三日电】中共河北省委结合春耕整社工作布置了全省的粮食“定产、定购、定销”工作。现在，各县党的组织和人民委员会正在起草各乡粮食“定产、定购、定销”指标方案，并准备召开县、区、乡三级干部会议或县人民代表大会讨论研究，迅速向农民传达。
    中共河北省委在全省春耕整社会议上传达布置了粮食“定产、定购、定销”工作，要求各级党组织要把粮食“定产、定购、定销”工作和春耕整社结合起来向下传达布置。并指出：只有把粮食“定产、定购、定销”工作和春耕整社结合起来，发动农民算清全乡的粮食生产多少、出卖多少、自留多少，紧接着检查实现粮食增产的准备工作，和研究实现增产的办法，才能有力的推动农业生产合作社、互助组和全体农民作好当前的春耕生产，使农业生产合作社和互助组进一步巩固发展起来。
    据新华社太原讯：中共山西省各级党委采取各种措施把实行粮食的定产、定购、定销的政策迅速传达到农村。中共山西省委员会在三月七日召开会议讨论了今年全省粮食统购统销任务和贯彻“三定”政策的措施和步骤。各中共地方委员会最近正召开各县主要干部会议作更具体的研究和部署。预计这一工作在二十五日前就可布置到乡村。
    为了迅速地向农民广泛传达粮食定产、定购、定销的意义和作用，发动农民积极开展春耕生产，全省各级党委将动员一百多万干部、人民代表和宣传员参加工作队，开展各种形式的宣传活动。
