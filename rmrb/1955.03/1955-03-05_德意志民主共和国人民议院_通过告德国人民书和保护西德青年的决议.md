    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 3rd (TASS dispatch): After discussing Prime Minister Grotewohl's government statement, the representatives of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic unanimously passed an appeal to the German people and a resolution on protecting peace-loving youth in West Germany.

    The appeal to the German people condemns the West German Federal Assembly's ratification of the Paris Agreements as a violation of the will of the West German people and a violation of international agreements on the restoration of German unity.

    The appeal to the German people supports Prime Minister Grotewohl's proposal, advocating for an immediate referendum to express opposition to the Paris Agreements and to strive for the peaceful restoration of German unity through free all-German elections.

    The appeal to the German people calls on all peace-loving German people to unite to abolish the Paris Agreements.

    The resolution on protecting West German peace-loving youth states that the Bonn Federal Assembly's ratification of the Paris Agreements is a major threat to West German youth. In view of the Adenauer government and the American and British occupiers adopting persecution and terror tactics against West German youth who are fighting for German unity and for peace, the People's Chamber has decided that: Any youth in West Germany who are persecuted for opposing the policy of remilitarization and opposing the threat of conscription can come to the German Democratic Republic and can work or study in the German Democratic Republic according to their expertise. After normal conditions are established in West Germany, these young people can also return to their hometowns to live and work.

    The People's Chamber authorizes the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic to take all necessary measures to implement this resolution.

    德意志民主共和国人民议院
    通过告德国人民书和保护西德青年的决议
    【新华社四日讯】　据塔斯社柏林三日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院的代表在讨论了格罗提渥总理的政府声明之后一致通过了告德国人民书和关于保护西德爱好和平的青年的决议。
    告德国人民书谴责西德联邦议院批准巴黎协定是违背西德人民的意志和违反关于恢复德国统一的国际协定。
  告德国人民书支持格罗提渥总理的建议，主张立即举行人民投票，来表示反对巴黎协定和争取通过全德自由选举来和平恢复德国的统一。
    告德国人民书号召所有爱好和平的德国人民团结起来，废除巴黎协定。
    关于保护西德爱好和平的青年的决议说，波恩联邦议院批准巴黎协定是对西德青年的一大威胁。鉴于阿登纳政府和美英占领者对那些为争取德国统一和争取和平而斗争的西德青年采取迫害和恐怖措施，人民议院决定：凡是在西德为反对重新军国主义化政策、反对征兵威胁而遭到迫害的青年可以到德意志民主共和国来，并且可以按照他们的专长在德意志民主共和国工作或学习。在西德建立正常条件后，这些青年还可以回到他们的故乡去生活和工作。
    人民议院授权德意志民主共和国部长会议采取一切必要措施来实现这一决议。
