Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19th: TASS, Washington, reports: Negotiations between Australian Prime Minister Menzies and U.S. official representatives are continuing in Washington.

Judging from newspaper reports, the main focus of the negotiations is on establishing the so-called mobile assault force proposed by Dulles at the Bangkok Conference. Washington is assigning this force the role of gendarme to suppress national liberation movements in Asian and Pacific countries.

According to a United Press International correspondent in Washington, Menzies and Eisenhower have already reached an agreement in principle on the need to take immediate measures to coordinate plans for joint action in the event of a conflict in Southeast Asia. Subsequently, negotiations turned to the drafting of specific steps to implement this agreement by the U.S. Department of Defense. According to newspaper reports, U.S. representatives are attempting to make Australia assume clear obligations to incorporate a certain number of troops (reportedly 10,000) into the mobile assault force, which can be used at any time according to U.S. wishes. According to the UPI correspondent, the negotiations also discussed equipping the Australian armed forces with long-range aircraft to make the Australian special forces a mobile force. Australia must build air force bases on its territory that can accommodate large U.S. bombers.

The U.S. intends to only dispatch aircraft and naval forces with atomic bombs to participate in the mobile force and promises to only dispatch ground forces to participate in the later stages of hostilities.

    美澳谈判建立侵略性机动攻击部队
    美国要澳大利亚出炮灰一万人
     【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：澳大利亚总理孟席斯和美国官方代表之间的谈判正继续在华盛顿进行。
    从报纸的消息来判断，谈判的主要注意力是集中在建立杜勒斯在曼谷会议上提出的所谓机动攻击部队上面，华盛顿指派这种部队担任镇压亚洲和太平洋各国的民族解放运动的宪兵的角色。
    据合众社驻华盛顿记者报道，孟席斯和艾森豪威尔已经在原则上达成协议，认为有必要立即采取措施来调配在一旦东南亚地区发生冲突的情况下采取联合行动的计划。随后，谈判便转为由美国国防部草拟实现这项协议的具体步骤。根据报纸报道，美国的代表们企图使澳大利亚承担明确的义务，把一定数目的军队（据说是一万人）并入机动攻击部队，这些军队可以随时按照美国的愿望加以使用。据合众社记者报道，谈判中同时讨论到用远程飞机来装备澳大利亚武装部队以便使得澳大利亚的特种部队成为机动部队的问题。澳大利亚必须在它的领土上建筑可以容纳大型美国轰炸机的空军基地。
    美国方面打算只派遣拥有原子弹的飞机和海军参加机动部队，而且答应只在敌对行动的较后阶段才派遣地面部队参加。
