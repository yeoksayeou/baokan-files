The women building our country's first steel base
In Anshan, our country's first steel base, women workers are diligently laboring whether at geological drilling sites in the towering mountains, in design offices planning the future of the steel capital, at construction sites high in the air, on the ground, and underground, or in production plants and mines that are tirelessly producing steel and steel products day and night.

Currently, nearly seven thousand women workers are participating in the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. Among the more than four thousand four hundred women workers in the production system, they are distributed throughout all aspects of the entire production process of this large iron and steel complex, with more than one hundred and forty of them holding administrative and technical leadership positions such as section chiefs, factory directors, section heads, workshop directors, engineers, technicians, technologists, and foremen.

In Anshan Iron and Steel's newly built, first-class technologically equipped large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and the Second Sheet Mill, every process, from shearing to finishing, has women workers. Here, hundreds of young women from rural areas and graduates of higher primary schools, having participated in production for just over a year (the Second Sheet Mill only started operation six months ago), are now not only mostly skilled technical workers capable of independent operation, but also beginning to train apprentices. Ren Yufen, a female crane operator at the large rolling mill, quickly mastered the technology through diligent study, despite not having a dedicated instructor after joining the factory. The crane she operates has not had any accidents in the past year and she was named an advanced producer in the factory. A sense of responsibility and honor has driven them to never yield to difficulties. During the heavy rains last August, the female workers of the Second Sheet Mill waded through chest-deep water from their dormitory in Taiping Village, more than ten li away, to get to work, with not a single person absent.

In departments with high labor intensity, the production achievements and spirit of overcoming difficulties of women workers are in no way inferior to those of male workers. The female ore selection workers in the raw materials section of the Dashiqiao Mine, known as the "Mothers' Group" (all the women in the group have children), overfulfilled their tasks every month last year, winning red flags and awards every month, with no one being absent throughout the year. In the basic construction projects, Yang Xiuting, a female bricklayer who is already skilled at climbing between scaffolding, Li Guilan, a female welder who mastered the all-purpose electric welding machine and complex welding techniques in three months, and other girls who are praised by the people, have all demonstrated tenacious perseverance in overcoming difficulties.

Female engineering and technical personnel and female management personnel have also played a creative role. Huang Dihua, a female designer who is already the mother of two children, saved 50,000 yuan in a certain design. Zhou Rong, deputy director of the Second Coking Workshop of the Chemical Plant, organized a technical research association with the workers and improved many of the mechanical equipment and operating methods of the coke oven. One of the equipment improvements can increase the country's coke production by 1,600 tons per year.

    建设第一个钢铁基地的妇女们
    在我国第一个钢铁基地——鞍山，不论在丛山峻岭的地质钻探场地，在规划钢都未来的设计室里，在高空、地面和地下的施工现场，或是在昼夜不停倾吐着钢铁和钢材的生产厂矿，都有女职工在辛勤劳动着。
    现在参加鞍钢生产和建设的女职工已近七千名。在生产系统的四千四百多名女职工，分布在这个大钢铁联合企业的整个生产过程的各方面，其中有一百四十多人担任处长、厂长、科长、车间主任、工程师、技师、技术员、工长等行政与技术领导职务。
    在新建的第一流技术装备的鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第二薄板厂，从剪断到精整，每个工序都有女工。这里的数百名来自农村和高小毕业的青年妇女，参加生产不过一年多（第二薄板厂才开工半年），现在不但大部分都已成为能独立操纵的技术工人，而且开始带徒弟了。大型轧钢厂女吊车工任玉芬，入厂后虽然没有专人教她，但由于她刻苦学习，很快就掌握了技术。她操纵的那台吊车，一年来没有发生任何事故，被评为全厂先进生产者。工作责任心和荣誉感促使她们从来没有向困难低过头。去年八月下大雨的几天，第二薄板厂的女工们趟着齐胸的水由十几里以外的太平村宿舍赶到工厂上班，没有一个人缺勤。
    在劳动强度较强的部门，女工的生产成就和克服困难精神也毫不低于男工。大石桥矿原料工段被称为“孩子妈妈组”（全组女工都有小孩）的女选料工，去年一年月月超额完成任务，月月得红旗、得奖，全年没有一个人欠勤。在基本建设工程中，已经熟练地在脚手架间爬上爬下的女瓦工杨秀廷，三个月就掌握了万能电焊机和复杂的焊接技术的电焊工李桂兰，及其他被人们赞扬的姑娘们，都在克服困难中表现了顽强的毅力。
    女工程技术人员和女管理人员也发挥了创造性。已经是两个孩子的母亲的女设计员黄棣华，在某项设计中节省了五万元的资金。化工工厂第二炼焦车间副主任周熔，和工人一起组织技术研究会，改进了焦炉上不少的机械设备和操作方法，其中有一项设备的改进，每年能给国家增产一千六百吨焦炭。
