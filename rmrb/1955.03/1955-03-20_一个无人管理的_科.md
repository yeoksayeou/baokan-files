    An Unmanaged "Section"
    To the Editor:
    The Ministry of Education has a Veterans' Education Section, with only two cadres. Because the work has no leadership, people call it the "Unmanaged Section." This section was established in early 1952 (initially as a division), and its task is to be responsible for the teaching and business guidance of schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers. In early 1953, this section was placed under the leadership of the Ministry of Education's Workers and Peasants' Spare-Time Education Department. In reality, the Workers and Peasants' Spare-Time Education Department rarely intervened. Later, the Workers and Peasants' Spare-Time Education Department merged into the Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy, and they lost their organizational leadership again. The two cadres of the Veterans' Education Section could not settle for doing nothing. They repeatedly made suggestions, requesting the higher authorities to provide specific leadership. In June 1954, the leaders of the Ministry of Education discussed with the Third Section of the Ministry of Civil Affairs' Preferential Treatment Bureau to work together in the same office, with the establishment still belonging to the Ministry of Education. From then on, the relationship between the Ministry of Education and them became even more distant. They neither saw the Ministry of Education's instructions and documents on teaching business, nor were they asked to participate in relevant meetings held by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education told them: "You are merged into the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The Ministry of Education only retains the establishment. Everything else belongs to the Ministry of Civil Affairs." However, the Ministry of Civil Affairs told them: "Your establishment and work belong to the Ministry of Education. Everything should be led by the Ministry of Education." Thus, they have been in a state of unmanaged affairs for a long time. To handle an official document or ask for instructions on a question, they cannot find a specific leading unit or leader, let alone carry out work. This situation cannot continue. The leaders of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Civil Affairs should pay attention to and properly resolve this issue.  Yě Jù (野炬)

    一个无人管理的“科”编辑同志：
    教育部有个荣军教育科，科里只有两个干部，因为工作没有人领导，所以人们都称它为“无人管理科”。这个科在一九五二年初就成立了（开始是处），它的任务是负责革命残废军人学校教学业务指导等工作。一九五三年初这个科划归教育部工农业余教育司领导，实际上工农业余教育司也很少过问，后来，工农业余教育司合并到扫除文盲工作委员会去了，他们又失去了组织领导。荣军教育科的两个干部是不能安于无事静坐的状况的，他们多次提出意见，要求上级给以具体领导；到一九五四年六月，教育部领导上才和内务部商量决定和内务部优抚局的三科合署办公，编制仍属教育部。从此，教育部和他们的关系更疏远了。他们既看不到教育部有关教学业务的指示文件，也没有人要他们参加教育部召开的有关的会议。教育部对他们说：“你们合并到内务部去，教育部仅保留个编制，其余一切都归内务部了。”而内务部又对他们说：“你们的编制和工作都是属于教育部的，一切应归教育部领导。”就这样，他们就长期处于无人管理的状态。他们要办一件公文，请示一个问题，都找不到具体的领导单位和领导人，当然更谈不到开展工作了。这种情况不能再继续下去了。教育部和内务部领导上，应该重视并妥善地解决这个问题。  野炬
