    Mechanized Timber Yard in the Yichun Forest Area
    At the No. 125 Timber Yard of the Shuangzi River Forest Industry Bureau in the Yichun Forest Area, 85% of the workers are currently performing mechanized log piling and loading operations. After April, it will become a fully mechanized timber yard.
    Currently, the No. 125 Yard is promoting advanced mechanized operation experiences such as the Soviet "A-frame loader," "single-drum winch log piling machine," and "using K-12 tractors for loading." The A-frame loader and K-12 tractor loading increase labor productivity by 330% compared to manual loading. The single-drum winch log piling machine increases efficiency by 120%. The cost of loading and piling per cubic meter of timber is reduced by 63% compared to the past. This can save the country over 340,000 yuan annually.
      The production task of the No. 125 Yard in 1955 is the same as in 1954, but in 1954, there were up to 1,200 workers. This year, in January, 110 workers were successively transferred from 922 workers to participate in other production and capital construction. Now, with only 310 workers, the entire year's production task can be completed, saving about 60% of manpower. (Liu Xian, Han Changlin)

    伊春林区的机械化贮木场
    伊春林区双子河森林工业局一二五贮木场，目前有百分之八十五的工人实行了机械化归楞和装车作业，四月份以后，它将变成一个全部机械化的贮木场。
    目前一二五场正推行苏联的“架杠式装车机”、“单筒绞盘归楞机”、“利用克特十二拖拉机装车”等机械化作业的先进经验。架杠装车机和克特十二拖拉机装车，较过去人力装车提高劳动生产效率百分之三百三十；单筒绞盘归楞机提高效率百分之一百二十。每立方公尺木材的装车和归楞成本，比过去降低百分之六十三，全年共可给国家节省资金三十四万多元。
      一二五场一九五五年生产任务和一九五四年是同样多的，但一九五四年工人最多时有一千二百多名，今年一月份就陆续从九百二十二名工人中调出一百一十名参加其他生产和基本建设，现在只有三百一十名工人，可以完成全年的生产任务，约节省了百分之六十的人力。（刘先、韩长林）
