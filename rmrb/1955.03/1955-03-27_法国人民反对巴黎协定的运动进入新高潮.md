    The French People's Movement Against the Paris Agreements Enters a New Climax
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) As the Council of the Republic of France began debating the ratification of the Paris Agreements on the 23rd, the movement of the French people from all walks of life against the Paris Agreements entered a new climax.
    Delegations of working people from Paris and many other cities flocked to the Council of the Republic. On the 23rd alone, 128 delegations visited the Council of the Republic. The delegations brought a large number of appeals signed by patriots, demanding the rejection of the Paris Agreements.
    The General Confederation of Labor of France issued a statement on the Council of the Republic's commencement of debate on the Paris Agreements, reiterating the disastrous consequences of ratifying these agreements. The General Confederation of Labor called on the French working people to send more delegations to the Council of the Republic, send letters, telegrams, and appeals to the members of the Council, demanding that they reject the Paris Agreements. At the same time, the General Confederation of Labor called on the working people to implement work stoppages in their enterprises to protest the arming of Bonn revanchists.
    According to "L'Humanité," workers in some industrial enterprises are organizing short protest strikes. Short-term strikes have been held at the Rochebrune construction site (Hautes-Alpes), in Montreuil in the suburbs of Paris, at the Asté factory in Saint-Denis, and in some industrial enterprises in Choisy-le-Roi and Courbevoie in the suburbs of Paris, and in other cities to protest the attempt to force France to accept the Paris Agreements.
    More and more political figures are also participating in the struggle against the Paris Agreements. According to a communique issued by the French National Peace Council, 21,377 municipal councilors, 3,587 mayors, and more than 400 provincial councilors from 62 provinces have recently risen up to oppose the re-militarization of West Germany.
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 26th] (TASS dispatch from Paris, March 25th) The debate in the French Council of the Republic on the ratification of the Paris Agreements is being closely watched by French society.
    A large crowd of people stood guard in front of the Luxembourg Palace, where the Council of the Republic was meeting, from early morning until late at night, in order to remind the members: the French people refuse to arm West Germany. Industrial enterprises continue to hold protest strikes against the revival of the German "Wehrmacht".
    The French Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the German Question organized a rally at the Winter Velodrome, at which a resolution was passed stating: "We reiterate: we uncompromisingly oppose the Paris Agreements. We reiterate: we want to start negotiations on a peaceful resolution of the German question immediately. Our people are fighting for independence, security, disarmament and peace. They will never agree to sacrifice national interests. They will never agree to arm Germany."
    On the evening of the 24th, a group of parliamentarians and social leaders hosted a gathering. Those attending the gathering included former Prime Minister Paul Boncour, parliamentarians Pierre Lebrun and Mrs. Lipkowski, and scientists, among others. Lebrun spoke at the meeting, pointing out the danger of reviving German militarism and the necessity of maintaining traditional friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union.

    法国人民反对巴黎协定的运动进入新高潮
    据新华社讯：由于共和国参议院二十三日开始辩论批准巴黎协定问题，法国各阶层人民反对巴黎协定的运动进入新的高潮。
    巴黎和许多其他城市的劳动人民代表团络绎不绝地涌向共和国参议院来。二十三日一天中，就有一百二十八个代表团访问了共和国参议院。代表团带来了大量的有爱国者签名的呼吁书，要求拒绝巴黎协定。
    法国总工会就共和国参议院开始辩论巴黎协定一事发表声明，再次强调指出批准这些协定的灾难性后果。总工会要求法国劳动人民派遣更多的代表团到共和国参议院去，向参议院的议员们发出信件、电报和呼吁书，要求他们拒绝巴黎协定，总工会同时要求劳动人民在他们的企业中实行停工来抗议武装波恩复仇主义者。
    据“人道报”报道，一些工业企业的工人们正在组织短时间的抗议罢工。在罗什布朗建筑工地（上阿尔卑斯省），在巴黎郊区蒙特勒伊，在圣但尼的阿斯戴工厂里，在巴黎郊区秀恩维尔勒邦和库柏瓦以及其他城市的一些工业企业里都举行了短时间的罢工，抗议强使法国接受巴黎协定的企图。
    愈来愈多的政界人士也参加到反对巴黎协定的斗争的行列里来，据法国全国和平委员会发表的公报说，在最近已有二万一千三百七十七名市议员、三千五百八十七名市长和六十二个省份的四百多个省议员起来反对西德重新军国主义化。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：法国共和国参议院关于批准巴黎协定的辩论，受到法国社会人士的密切注意。
    一大群人从一清早到深夜都守候在共和国参议院开会地点卢森堡宫面前，以便提醒议员们：法国人民拒绝武装西德。工业企业也继续举行反对复活德国“国防军”的抗议罢工。
    法国和平解决德国问题委员会在冬季赛车场组织了一次集会，会上通过决议说：“我们重申：我们毫不妥协地反对巴黎协定。我们重申：我们希望马上开始关于和平解决德国问题的谈判。我们人民为争取独立、安全、裁军及和平而奋斗。他们绝不会同意牺牲民族利益。他们绝不会同意武装德国。”
    二十四日晚上，一批议员和社会领袖主持了一次集会，参加这次集会的人中，有前总理保罗·邦古、议员皮埃尔·勒庞和李普科夫斯基夫人，还有科学家等等。勒庞在会上讲了话，指出复活德国军国主义的危险和维持同苏联的传统友谊和联盟的必要性。
