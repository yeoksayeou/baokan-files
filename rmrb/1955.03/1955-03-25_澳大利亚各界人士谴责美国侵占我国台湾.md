Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: The Sydney "Tribune" reported on the 16th that the Australia-China Friendship Association held a rally in Sydney with about 1,000 participants. Professor Fitzgerald of the Australian National University, former Secretary of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs Jo Bolton, and General Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union New South Wales Branch, F. H. Campbell, delivered speeches at the meeting, condemning the United States' armed occupation of China's territory of Taiwan. They said: Taiwan has been Chinese territory for centuries, and now it must be returned to China.

Fitzgerald said: To consider a country trying to recover its own territory—like China trying to recover Taiwan—as engaging in "aggression" is contrary to justice, common sense, and peace. He emphasized: "The United States should be told that the Australian people do not support its current policy in the Taiwan Strait. On this issue, there is no common ground between the Australian people and the United States government."

Campbell said, "The Chinese government has reason to demand that Taiwan be placed under its administration."

Another speaker, Dr. Stephen Mackintosh, said, "The Chinese people are eager for peace."

Xinhua News Agency: Cape Town's "New Age" newspaper reported on March 10th that the "Colonial Youth Day" was recently held in Port Elizabeth under the auspices of the African National Congress Youth League. The youth who participated in the commemoration of this festival demanded that Taiwan be returned to the People's China, and demanded the complete destruction of thermonuclear weapons, so that atomic energy is only used for peaceful purposes. The youth passed a resolution, guaranteeing that the oppressed South African youth stand in solidarity with the youth of the world who oppose colonialism.

    澳大利亚各界人士谴责美国侵占我国台湾
    【新华社二十四日讯】据悉尼“论坛”周报十六日报道：澳中协会十一日在悉尼举行约有一千人参加的集会，国立澳大利亚大学教授费兹吉拉德、前澳大利亚外交部秘书长约·博尔顿和电气工会新南威尔士分会总书记弗·赫·坎贝尔在会上发表演说，谴责美国武装侵占中国领土台湾。他们说：几百年以来台湾一直是中国的领土，现在它必须归还给中国。
    费兹吉拉德说：认为一个国家在设法收复自己的领土——像中国在设法恢复台湾——是在进行“侵略”，这是违反正义、常理和和平的。他强调说：“应当告诉美国，澳大利亚人民不支持它目前在台湾海峡所执行的政策。在这个问题上，澳大利亚人民同美国政府之间是没有什么共同一致可言的。”
    坎贝尔说，“中国政府有理由要求把台湾置于它的管理之下。”
    另一位讲演人斯蒂芬·马金多博士说，“中国人民迫切希望和平。”
   【新华社讯】南非开普敦“新世纪报”三月十日报道：在非洲人国民大会青年团主持下，伊丽莎白港最近举行了“殖民地青年日”。参加这个节日的纪念活动的青年们要求把台湾归还给人民中国，并且要求彻底销毁热核子武器，使原子能只用于和平的目的。青年们通过决议，保证备受压迫的南非青年同反对殖民主义的全世界青年团结一致。
