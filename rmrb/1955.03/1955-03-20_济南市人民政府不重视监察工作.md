To the Editorial Board:

    I am a cadre of the People's Supervision Committee of the Jinan Municipal People's Government. From my work experience, I feel that the Jinan Municipal People's Government does not pay enough attention to supervisory work.

    The People's Supervision Committee of the Jinan Municipal People's Government has been established for more than three years since August 1951, but it has never had a full-time responsible cadre. When it was first established, there was the Minister of the Organization Department of the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China concurrently serving as the Director of the Supervision Committee, and the Director of the Office of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Municipal Committee concurrently serving as the Secretary-General of the Supervision Committee. Unfortunately, these concurrent leaders were transferred one after another not long after. Because this institution has been without a responsible person for a long time, coupled with the disunity among several section chiefs, the work has been very chaotic. The former Central People's Government Supervision Committee had instructed that governments at all levels should avoid transferring cadres from the supervision organs as much as possible in order to accumulate experience and move towards specialization; however, the Jinan Municipal People's Government did not do this. For example, of the original six section chiefs of the Supervision Committee, three were transferred in 1954, two of whom had more than three years of supervisory work experience. As for the general cadres of the Supervision Committee, they have never been fully staffed.

    In the past, the Central Government has repeatedly instructed that governments at all levels should attach importance to supervisory work, strengthen leadership over supervisory organs, regularly discuss and frequently inspect their work, help supervisory organs solve difficulties, and enable them to fully play their role as assistants. The Jinan Municipal Supervision Committee has not made work plans or summary reports for a long time, and the Municipal People's Government does not care about it. There was even such a thing: the Municipal Supervision Committee sent someone to attend a meeting convened by the superior supervision committee. After returning, they proposed to report to the Municipal Government the guidelines and tasks for future supervision work decided by the Third National Supervision Work Conference and asked for instructions on how to implement them. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government actually replied that he was too busy to listen.

    With the development of national economic construction, the tasks of supervision work are also more arduous. What are the plans of the Jinan Municipal People's Government for supervisory work? Will it maintain the status quo, or will it take new measures? We are waiting for an answer.

    济南市人民政府不重视监察工作编辑同志：
    我是济南市人民政府人民监察委员会的干部。从我的工作体验中，感到济南市人民政府对监察工作很不重视。
    济南市人民政府人民监察委员会自从一九五一年八月建立以来，已经三年多了，却始终没有专职的负责干部。在刚成立时，还有中共济南市委组织部长兼监委主任，市委纪律检查委员会办公室主任兼监委秘书长，可惜没有多久，这些兼职负责人就先后被调走了。由于这个机构长期无人负责，加上几个科长又闹不团结，以致工作十分混乱。前中央人民政府人民监察委员会曾有指示，要求各级政府尽可能不调动监察机关的干部，以便积累经验，走向专业化；但济南市人民政府并没有这样作。如：监委原有六个科长，一九五四年就调走三个，其中两人是有三年以上监察工作历史的。至于监委的一般干部，也始终没有配备齐全。
    过去，中央曾多次指示：各级政府要重视监察工作，加强对监察机关的领导，定期讨论并经常检查其工作，帮助监察机关解决困难，使它充分发挥助手作用。济南市监委长期不做工作计划和总结报告，市人民政府也不过问。甚至有过这样的事情：市监委派人出席了上级监委所召开的会议，回来后，提出要向市府汇报第三次全国监察工作会议所决定的今后监察工作的方针任务，并请示如何执行，市府秘书长竟答以工作忙没工夫听。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，监察工作的任务也更加繁重了。济南市人民政府对监察工作究竟作何打算呢？让它保持原状，还是采取新的措施？我们在等待着回答。　王尚武
