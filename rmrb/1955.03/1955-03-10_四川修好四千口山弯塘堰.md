Sichuan Repairs Four Thousand Mountain Bend Ponds and Dams
Sichuan farmers are seizing the time before spring plowing to build mountain bend ponds and dams. According to statistics from late February, over four thousand ponds have been completed throughout the province, and seven thousand five hundred more are under construction.

This year, Sichuan Province is undertaking mountain bend pond construction on a relatively large scale. The province has trained over 20,000 village cadres and active farmers to lead the construction. The work is being carried out using a method of demonstration projects at the county, district, and township levels, driving progress at each level.

Judging from the ponds that have already been built, because the ponds are located at the bends in the mountains, the pond embankments are short and low, achieving savings in labor, money, and land, and the projects are relatively solid. In Qinggang Township, Bishan County, the eleven mountain bend ponds built this time generally only took five or six days to complete, with each mu of farmland benefiting only requiring three or four workdays and very little cost for materials from the benefiting households, but the quality meets the standards. In Hongyan District, Zhaohua County, farmers completed nineteen mountain bend ponds in late February, which can irrigate more than two thousand mu of farmland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川修好四千口山弯塘堰
    四川农民正抓紧春耕前的时间兴修山弯塘堰。据二月下旬统计：全省已修好四千多口塘，正在修建的有七千五百多口。
    今年四川省修山弯塘的规模较大。全省共训练了领导修建的乡村干部和农民积极分子两万多名。并采用县、区、乡三级作示范兴修、层层带动的办法开展这一工作。
    从现在已修好的塘来看：由于塘的位置在山弯锁口处，塘埂短而矮，做到了省工、省钱、省地，工程也较牢固。璧山县青杠乡这次修的十一口山弯塘，一般只经过五、六天就完工，受水户每亩田只负担三、四个工和极少的工料费，但质量都合乎规格，昭化县红岩区农民在二月下旬修好了十九口山弯塘，能灌田二千多亩。　（新华社）
