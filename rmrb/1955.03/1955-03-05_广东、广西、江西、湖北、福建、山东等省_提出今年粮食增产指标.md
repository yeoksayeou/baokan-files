Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Shandong and other provinces have separately formulated agricultural production plans for this year, and have proposed targets for increasing grain production this year. Guangdong Province plans to increase grain production by 10 percent compared to last year. Guangxi Province plans to increase grain production by 1.2 billion jin this year. Jiangxi Province requires this year's grain production to increase by 960 million jin compared to last year, an increase of 8.3 percent compared to last year. Hubei Province's grain production plan for this year is not only to restore the level of 1953 before the major floods, but also to increase production by 400 million jin compared to 1953. This year's grain production plan in Fujian Province will increase by more than 10 percent. Shandong Province plans to produce 26.4 billion jin of grain this year, an increase of 1 billion jin compared to the province's planned total output last year.

　　When these provinces formulated their agricultural production and production increase plans for this year, they analyzed the local specific conditions, tapped the potential of agricultural production, and decided to adopt various measures according to local conditions. Guangdong Province, based on the favorable conditions of continuous planting of various crops in four seasons, sufficient rainfall, a large amount of wasteland that can be reclaimed, and many single-cropping fields that can be developed into double-cropping fields, rationally arranged the production increase plan. Guangxi Province is located in the subtropics with abundant rainfall, and most areas can carry out three seasons of production a year. However, in the past, many rice fields only grew one season of crops, and dry land was not well utilized. This year, it is planned to change the farming habits of these areas and make full use of land resources. The province plans to change 5 million mu of single-season rice fields into double-season rice fields, and farmers in northern single-season rice areas plan to change from one-season production to multiple-season production and expand the winter planting area this year; farmers in southeastern double-season rice areas will comprehensively improve various agricultural technologies; farmers in the northwestern coarse grain production areas will change the common habit of not applying fertilizer, and vigorously build water conservancy projects to turn some dry land into paddy fields. Fujian Province has a good climate, and most of the fields can grow two or three seasons of crops a year. In the coastal plains with high grain yields, each mu can produce up to 1,700 jin. However, this area is often hit by droughts every year. In addition, about 70 percent of the province's farmland is distributed in mountainous areas, most of which only grow one season of crops a year, with very little fertilizer application, producing only 100 to 200 jin per mu. In response to this situation, Fujian Province plans to build 100 agricultural technology promotion stations, train 60,000 agricultural technicians, and help farmers change their farming systems. This year, Shandong Province will expand the irrigated area by 1.4 million mu by drilling wells, building small reservoirs and ponds, and implementing free-flowing irrigation projects. In addition to promoting new agricultural tools, it will also expand intercropping and overlapping cropping areas by 1.5 million mu, and promote reasonable close planting, seedling checking and seedling replanting.

　　Now, the leading organs of these provinces are actively leading farmers to strive to complete this year's agricultural production and production increase plans. Jiangxi Province and Hubei Province are striving to complete this year's farmland water conservancy projects in a timely manner. In Longxi, Jinjiang and other 18 counties in the coastal plains of Fujian Province, where grain yields are high, more than 22,000 farmland water conservancy projects have been completed and are under construction, which can benefit more than 800,000 mu of farmland. Farmers in mountainous areas are systematically changing their farming systems, expanding the grain planting area, and accumulating a large amount of soil fertilizer to improve 2 million mu of mountain soil.

### 广东、广西、江西、湖北、福建、山东等省  提出今年粮食增产指标

    广东、广西、江西、湖北、福建、山东等省
    提出今年粮食增产指标
    【本报讯】　广东、广西、江西、湖北、福建、山东等省已分别订出今年农业生产计划，并提出了今年粮食增产的指标。广东省今年粮食产量计划比去年提高百分之十。广西省今年计划增产粮食十二亿斤。江西省要求今年粮食比去年增产九亿六千万斤，比去年增产百分之八点三。湖北省今年粮食生产计划不但要恢复到遭受大水前一九五三年的水平，而且要比一九五三年增产四亿斤。今年福建省粮食产量计划增加百分之十以上。山东省今年计划生产粮食二百六十四亿斤，比去年全省的计划总产量增加十亿斤。
    这些省份制订今年农业生产和增产计划时，曾经分析了当地的具体情况，挖掘了农业生产方面的潜力，并决定因地制宜地采取各项措施。广东省根据有四季不断地种植各种庄稼的气候，有充足的雨量，有大量可开垦的荒地，有很多单造田可以开辟水源变成双造田等有利条件，合理安排了增产计划。广西省地处亚热带，雨量充足，大部地区一年可进行三季生产。但是，过去不少稻田仅种植一季作物，旱地也没有很好利用。今年计划改变这类地区的耕作习惯，充分利用地力。全省计划将五百万亩单季稻田改变为双季稻田，北部种植单季稻地区的农民打算变一季生产为多季生产，扩大今年冬种面积；东南部种植双季稻地区的农民将全面提高各种农业技术；西北部杂粮产区的农民将改变普遍不施肥的习惯，并大力兴修水利变一部分旱田为水田。福建省气候良好，大部田地一年可以种植两季或三季作物。沿海平原粮食高产地区，每亩最多可产一千七百斤。但是，这一带地区每年常受旱灾侵袭。另外，全省约有百分之七十的耕田分布在山区，大多一年只种植一季作物，施肥也很少，每亩只产一、二百斤。针对这种情况，福建全省计划新建一百处农业技术推广站，训练六万名农业技术员，帮助农民改变耕作制度。山东省今年将用打井、修小型蓄水库和蓄水池、举办自流灌溉工程等办法，扩大浇地面积一百四十万亩。除推广新式农具外，还将扩大间作、套作面积一百五十万亩，和推行合理密植、查苗补苗等。
    现在，这些省份的领导机关正积极领导农民为完成今年农业生产和增产计划而努力。江西省和湖北省正争取及时完成今年的农田水利工程。福建省沿海平原粮食高产量地区的龙溪、晋江等十八个县，现已修成和正在兴修的农田水利工程达二万二千多处，共可使八十多万亩田地受益。山区各地农民正有计划地改变耕作制度，扩大粮食种植面积，并大量增积土肥，以改良二百万亩山田土壤。
