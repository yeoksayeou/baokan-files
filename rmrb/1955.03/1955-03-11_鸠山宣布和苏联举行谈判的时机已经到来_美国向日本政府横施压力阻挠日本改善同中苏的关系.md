Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: According to Kyodo News, Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama announced on the 9th, after consulting with Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, that the time has come for Japan to send a delegation to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union to normalize relations between the two countries. He said that Shigemitsu supports his suggestion to appoint Sugihara Arata, chairman of the Democratic Party's Special Committee on Foreign Affairs, as the head of the Japanese delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, March 10th, Tokyo dispatch: Harold Stassen, director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, who is currently visiting Tokyo, held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on the 9th. According to Kyodo News, Stassen "warned" Japan not to "go too far" in developing trade with the peaceful and democratic camp. Kyodo News said that Stassen urged Japan to accelerate its rearmament, and he accused Japan of being "too dependent" on other countries for "defense."

According to Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Washington, Iwadate, the U.S. ruling group is fully strengthening its pressure on the Japanese government, with the aim of forcing Hatoyama to abandon the promises he made during the election to improve relations with China and the Soviet Union. Iwadate said that in the future, if the Japanese government shows "excessive tendencies" in its relations with China and the Soviet Union, the United States may use its "last trump card" to blackmail Japan, which is "restrictions on foreign debt control regulations on Japan-China trade, defense burden-sharing fees, special procurements, overseas purchases, etc." Iwadate also said that the U.S. demand that Japan accelerate its rearmament is also one of the means of coercing Japan not to improve its relations with China and the Soviet Union. He said: "If the Hatoyama Cabinet actively conducts trade with China and the Soviet Union, the United States will demand the strengthening of defense forces."

Xinhua News Agency, March 10th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese business circles have issued a call for "trade, not aid." The Japan Tariff Association, composed of approximately 1,500 business organizations nationwide, issued a trade statement on the 9th, expressing dissatisfaction with the United States' trade discrimination and unilateral dumping policies against Japan.

The association pointed out that although the United States verbally proclaims that free trade is its ultimate goal, "the ironclad fact remains that the United States' tariff rates are much higher compared to other countries." The association said that the United States levies taxes equivalent to 30 to 70 percent of the value of major Japanese exports. However, almost all U.S. exports to Japan are tax-free.

The association explained the state of U.S.-Japan trade under the restrictions of high U.S. tariffs: In 1954, U.S. exports to Japan reached $867 million, accounting for 35 percent of Japan's total imports for the year, while Japanese exports to the United States were only $277 million. The association pointed out: "Whether in 1953 or 1954, Japan bought three times as much from the United States as it sold to the United States." The association said: "Like other free countries in the world, Japan strongly demands trade, not aid." The association also requested the United States to reduce tariffs on 250 major Japanese exports to the United States.

The exploitation Japan suffers from accepting U.S. "aid" is exemplified by the following facts. According to a Reuters report on the 9th, due to the harsh conditions of U.S. "aid," Japanese public opinion calls the U.S. surplus agricultural product loan to Japan "bitter pills from Washington." The conditions for this U.S. loan include a "dollar clause" stipulating that Japan must calculate the repayment of the loan according to the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar at that time, and the interest rate on the loan is as high as 4 percent. Kyodo News Agency quoted the Ministry of Finance on February 20th as saying: "Accepting this U.S. loan—a loan that will bind Japan with the 'American clause' and high interest rates for as long as 40 years—will place Japan in the same position as a U.S. dependency, which is also bad for Japan's reputation in the international arena." Currently, Japan is still requesting the United States to cancel the "dollar clause" and reduce the interest rate on the loan. These requests have been rejected by the United States.

### 鸠山宣布和苏联举行谈判的时机已经到来  美国向日本政府横施压力阻挠日本改善同中苏的关系

    鸠山宣布和苏联举行谈判的时机已经到来
    美国向日本政府横施压力阻挠日本改善同中苏的关系
    【新华社十日讯】据共同社报道：日本首相鸠山一郎在九日和外务相重光葵会商后宣布：日本选派代表团和苏联举行使两国关系正常化的谈判的时机已经到来。他说：重光葵支持他的建议，由民主党外交特别委员会主席杉原荒太任日本代表团的团长。
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：正在东京访问的美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在九日和日本首相鸠山一郎举行了会谈。据共同社报道，史塔生曾
  “警告”日本发展对和平民主阵营的贸易“不可太过火”。共同社说，史塔生督促日本要加紧重新武装，他责备日本在“防务”上“过于依赖”其他国家。
    据共同社驻华盛顿记者岩馆报道，美国统治集团正在全力加强对日本政府的压力，目的是要迫使鸠山放弃他在竞选时所作的改善对中苏关系的诺言。岩馆说：今后，如果日本政府在对中、苏的关系上表现出“过火的倾向”，美国就可能使用“最后王牌”来要挟日本，这就是“限制日中贸易的外债管制条例和防卫分担费、特需订货、海外采购等等”。岩馆又说，美国要求日本加紧重新武装也是胁迫日本不得改善它和中苏的关系的手段之一。他说：“如果鸠山内阁积极进行对中、苏的贸易，美国就会要求加强防御力量。”
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本企业界发出了“要贸易、不要援助”的呼声。由全国约一千五百个企业团体组成的日本关税协会在九日发表贸易声明，对于美国对日本的贸易歧视和片面倾销政策表示不满。
    协会指出：尽管美国在口头上宣扬自由贸易是它的最终目的，“铁的事实却仍然是美国的关税率和其他国家相比较要高得多”。协会说：美国对日本大宗的出口货课以相当于货价的百分之三十到七十的税。而美国对日本出口的货物却几乎全是免税的。
    协会说明了在美国高关税限制下的美日贸易情况：一九五四年美国对日本的出口达八亿六千七百万美元，占日本全年进口的百分之三十五，而日本对美国的出口却只有二亿七千七百万美元。协会指出：“不论在一九五三年或一九五四年，日本从美国买进的都是三倍于它向美国卖出的。”协会说：
  “像世界上其他自由国家一样，日本强烈地要求贸易，而决不是援助。”协会并要求美国降低二百五十项日本对美国出口的主要货物的关税。
    日本接受美国“援助”所受到的榨取有下面这些事实。据路透社九日报道，由于美国“援助”条件的苛刻，日本舆论把美国对日本的剩余农产品贷款叫做“从华盛顿来的苦丸药”。美国这宗贷款的条件包括一项“美元条款”，规定日本必须在偿还贷款时按照当时日元对美元的兑换率计算，而且贷款的利息高达四分。共同社曾经在二月二十日引大藏省的话指出：“接受美国这宗贷款——这宗贷款将在长达四十年的时间里以‘美国条款’和高利息束缚日本——会把日本置于和美国的附属国相同的地位，从日本在国际上的名声来说也是不好的。”目前日本仍在要求美国取消贷款的“美元条款”和减低贷款利息。这些要求已经被美国拒绝。
