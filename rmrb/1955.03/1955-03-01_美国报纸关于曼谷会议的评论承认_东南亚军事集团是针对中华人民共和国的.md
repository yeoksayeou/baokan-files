Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th TASS: American newspapers, in commenting on the recently concluded meeting of foreign ministers of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) countries in Bangkok, particularly emphasized Dulles' speech at one of the meetings. Dulles said at the meeting that the United States considered Southeast Asia as one of the "three battle lines" in Asia (American diplomatic authorities believe that Korea and Taiwan are the other two battle lines). "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger believed that this remark was tantamount to openly admitting that the Southeast Asian military group was aimed at the People's Republic of China.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" openly admitted in an editorial that the United States intends to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in its policy of threatening the People's Republic of China.

    These newspapers also mentioned the measures planned by the conference to suppress the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia under the pretext of combating "subversives."

    However, these newspapers had to admit that the conference revealed that there were not only differences between the United States and Southeast Asian countries, but also between the imperialist initiators of the conference - the United States and Britain.

    The American newspapers quoted the London "Times." This newspaper said on February 24 that, given the necessity of military preparations in Europe and military measures in the Commonwealth, Britain considers Southeast Asia only a part of the world problem, and perhaps a relatively secondary part, while the United States intends to turn Southeast Asia into a "third battle line" in Asia. Although British diplomatic authorities actively support the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's measures to suppress the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia for tactical reasons, they dare not unconditionally support the United States' adventurous aggressive plans against China, which can only result in new failures for the policies of the imperialist countries.

    The "New York Times"' Bangkok dispatch pointed out that American and British participants in the meeting confirmed after the Eden-Dulles talks that there were differences not only on the Taiwan issue but also on other major issues in the Far East. For example, British officials said that they did not agree with Dulles' proposal at the meeting that the so-called "defense of Taiwan" measures should be closely linked to the plans of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    The "New York Times" pointed out that the British official spokesman's avoidance of formal comment on Dulles' "three battle lines" theory is very telling.

    The London "Times"' Bangkok correspondent said that Dulles' claim that Southeast Asia Treaty member states should support the United States' military measures in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan as part of their own defense goes beyond the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty.

    In the process of discussing economic issues, the Pakistani representative put forward three proposals advocating the establishment of a special economic agency to uniformly plan economic activities within the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. These proposals were not adopted. The Philippines and France supported this suggestion. However, Stassen, the director of the US Foreign Operations Administration who attended the meeting, told the representatives that the United States did not like this idea and that the United States would continue to handle matters through bilateral channels.

    According to newspaper reports, the differences between the participants were also manifested in the drafting of the final communique. Due to differences between Dulles and Eden, another meeting had to be convened to draft the communique.

    American newspapers have been forced to admit that the people of Asian countries unanimously condemn the aggressive aims of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the aggressive policies of the United States.

    The "New York Times"' Bangkok reporter Sulzberger sadly pointed out: "We paid for the music, so we feel entitled to set the strategic tune, but we can't get everyone to dance."

### 美国报纸关于曼谷会议的评论承认  东南亚军事集团是针对中华人民共和国的

    美国报纸关于曼谷会议的评论承认
    东南亚军事集团是针对中华人民共和国的
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国报纸在评论刚刚结束的在曼谷举行的东南亚条约组织国家外长的会议时，特别强调杜勒斯在一次会议上的发言。杜勒斯在这次会上说，美国认为东南亚是亚洲的“三条战线”之一（美国外交当局认为，朝鲜和台湾是另外两条战线）。“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格认为这番话等于是公开承认东南亚军事集团是针对中华人民共和国的。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在一篇社论中公开承认，美国打算在它的威胁中华人民共和国的政策中利用东南亚条约组织。
    这些报纸还提到会议策划的在打击“颠覆分子”的借口下镇压东南亚民族解放运动的措施。
    可是，这些报纸不得不承认，会议暴露出，不但在美国和东南亚国家之间存在着分歧，而且在会议的帝国主义发起者——美国和英国之间也存在着分歧。
    美国报纸援引了伦敦“泰晤士报”的话。这家报纸在二月二十四日说，鉴于欧洲的军事准备和英联邦中的军事措施的必要性，英国认为东南亚只是世界问题的一部分，而且也许是比较次要的一部分，而美国却打算把东南亚变成在亚洲的“第三条战线”。英国外交当局虽然由于战术上的原因，积极支持东南亚条约组织的镇压东南亚民族解放运动的措施，但是却不敢无条件地支持美国对中国的冒险侵略计划，这种计划的结果只能是帝国主义国家的政策遭到新的失败。
    “纽约时报”的曼谷消息指出，美英两国参加会议的人士在艾登同杜勒斯会谈后证实，不但在台湾问题上，而且在远东其他重大问题上都存在着分歧。例如，英国人士说，他们并不同意杜勒斯在会上提出的所谓“保卫台湾”的措施应当同东南亚条约组织的计划紧密联系起来的主张。
    “纽约时报”指出，英国官方发言人对杜勒斯的“三条战线”的理论避免发表正式评论，是很可以说明问题的。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”曼谷特派记者说，杜勒斯主张东南亚条约成员国应该支持美国在朝鲜、日本和台湾的军事措施，作为它们自己的防务的一部分，这种说法是超出东南亚条约的范围的。
    在讨论经济问题的过程中，巴基斯坦代表提出了三个提案，主张成立一个特别的经济机构，来统一规划东南亚条约组织范围内的经济活动。这些提案没有获得通过。菲律宾和法国支持这一建议。但是，出席会议的美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生却对代表们说，美国不喜欢这个主意，美国要继续通过双边的途径办事。
    据报纸消息，与会者之间的分歧在起草最后的公报的过程中也表现出来。由于杜勒斯和艾登意见分歧，曾经不得不另外召集一次会议来草拟公报。
    美国报纸已经被迫承认，亚洲各国人民一致非难东南亚条约组织的侵略目的和美国的侵略政策。
    “纽约时报”曼谷记者苏兹贝格悲哀地指出：“我们付了奏乐的费用，因此觉得有权规定战略调子，但是，我们却不能使每一个人都跳起舞来。”
