Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: According to foreign news agencies, the United States, Britain, and France are planning to hold a "high-level meeting" on Indochina in the near future. The purpose of the meeting is to "coordinate the policies of the three major powers towards Indochina."

Information reveals that one of the issues the three countries may discuss is the Vietnamese general election. According to the Geneva Accords, free general elections should be held throughout Vietnam in July 1956 to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. However, the United States has been instigating obstruction and sabotage of this general election in order to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into an American military base. US Secretary of State Dulles hinted in his speech on March 8th that the United States would create excuses to obstruct the election. From the revealed information, it appears the United States is attempting to drag Britain and France along with it to renege on the Geneva Accords, obstruct the free general election in Vietnam, and thereby undermine the peace and unity of Vietnam.

News also points out that the United States also intends to pressure France to abandon negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to establish normal economic relations. An Associated Press reporter said: On the issue of Franco-Vietnamese economic relations, "There are serious differences between the US and France, and it is reported that Dulles rebuked the French representative, Bonnet, on this issue in Bangkok, Thailand." Many reports say that one of the purposes of the United States in doing so is to stifle French enterprises in Indochina so that American capital can replace French economic power.

    美英法筹划举行关于印度支那的会议
    美国想拖着英法破坏越南普选
    【新华社十一日讯】　据外国通讯社报道，美、英、法三国正计划在最近举行一次关于印度支那的“高级会议”。会议的目的是要“协调三大国对印度支那的政策”。
    据消息透露，三国可能要讨论的问题之一是越南普选问题。按照日内瓦协议的规定，在一九五六年七月内越南全国应举行自由普选以实现越南的和平统一。然而，美国一直在策动阻挠和破坏这个普选，以便永久分裂越南，把南越作为美国的军事基地。美国国务卿杜勒斯在三月八日的演说中就暗示美国要制造借口，阻挠普选的进行。从透露出来的消息看，美国正企图拖着英国、法国和它一起背弃日内瓦协议来阻挠越南自由普选，从而破坏越南的和平和统一。
    消息也指出，美国还打算压迫法国放弃同越南民主共和国建立正常经济关系的谈判。美联社记者说：在法越经济关系问题上，“美法两国之间有严重的分歧，据悉，杜勒斯曾在泰国曼谷就这个问题申斥过法国代表庞纳”。许多消息说，美国这样做的一个目的是要扼杀在印度支那的法国企业，以便美国资本来代替法国的经济势力。
