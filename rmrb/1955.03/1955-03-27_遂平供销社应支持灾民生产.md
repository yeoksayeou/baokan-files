To the Editor:

The Suiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Henan Province formulated a production relief work plan during the production and disaster relief campaign, deciding to vigorously purchase local products, specialties, and sideline products, supply disaster victims with production and living materials, and regulate livestock feed. However, due to their serious capitalist management thinking, they failed to achieve this.

We know that mastering reasonable prices is very important for developing sideline production and supporting the disaster relief campaign. However, the Suiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not pay attention to this. They always felt that the purchase prices of disaster victims' sideline products were too high and were afraid of losing money, so they looked for various excuses to lower the purchase prices. On February 15th, the Suiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, without the approval of its superiors, arbitrarily lowered the prices of twenty-six kinds of small commodities such as cypress fiber, hemp fiber, white hemp rope, and red thick thread. Generally, the prices were reduced by two to three cents per catty. Among them, cypress fiber was reduced from 28 cents per catty to 20 cents per catty; white hemp rope was reduced from 35 cents per catty to 28.5 cents.

This greatly increased the difficulties of the disaster victims. Cai Gang Township in the seventh district of Suiping County was originally a severely affected township. Due to the diverse sideline production activities, the disaster victims were very enthusiastic about production for self-relief. Because Cai Gang Township is close to the hemp-producing area, disaster victims who participated in spinning hemp fiber, hemp rope, and hemp thread could spin three catties of fiber per person per day. They could earn five to seven cents per catty, earning fifteen to twenty cents a day. According to statistics, 101 households with a total of 105 people in Cai Gang Township were engaged in this kind of sideline production, accounting for 35 percent of the disaster victim households engaged in sideline production in the entire township. After the county supply and marketing cooperative adjusted the price of hemp products on February 15th, this kind of sideline production became unprofitable, causing the sideline production in the entire township to stagnate. Before the adjustment of the purchase price, the Cai Gang Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative could collect more than 200 catties of hemp products every day; sometimes it could even collect more than 300 catties. After the price adjustment, from February 19th to 23rd, they only collected 16 catties of hemp products in four days.

The Suiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's failure to actively support production and disaster relief work has increased the difficulty for disaster victims to engage in production for self-relief and has affected the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the masses. We suggest that relevant leading organs promptly correct this practice of the Suiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

    遂平供销社应支持灾民生产编辑同志：
    河南省遂平县供销合作社，在生产救灾运动中曾制定了生产救灾工作计划，决定大力收购土产、特产和副业产品，供应灾民生产和生活资料，调剂牲畜草料。但是由于他们存在着严重的资本主义经营思想，没有做到这一点。
    我们知道，掌握合理的价格对开展副业生产、支持救灾运动是十分重要的。但遂平县供销合作社并不注意这些。他们总认为灾民的副业产品的收购价格过高，怕赔本，所以寻找各种借口降低收购价格。二月十五日，遂平县供销合作社不经领导上批准，擅自降低了柏脉、麻经子、小白绳、红大线等二十六种小宗商品的价格，一般的都降低了两三分，其中，柏脉竟从每斤二角八分，降低到每斤二角；麻货小白绳由每斤三角五分，降到二角八分五。
    这样一来，大大增加了灾民的困难。遂平县七区蔡岗乡原是一个重灾乡，灾民由于进行了多种多样的副业生产，生产自救的情绪非常高。蔡岗乡由于靠近产麻区，参加纺经子、麻绳和麻线的灾民，每人每天可纺三斤经子。每斤经子可赚五分到七分，一天就可赚一角五分到两角。据统计，蔡岗乡从事这种副业生产的有一百零一户共一百零五人，占全乡进行副业生产的灾民户的百分之三十五。县供销合作社从二月十五日把麻货价格调整以后，这种副业生产，已经无利可得，致使全乡副业生产陷于停滞状态。在未调整收购价格以前，蔡岗乡供销合作社每天可收麻货二百多斤；甚至有时可收三百多斤。调整价格以后，从二月十九日至二十三日的四天中只收麻货十六斤。
    遂平县供销合作社这种不积极支持生产救灾工作的做法，增加了灾民生产自救的困难，影响了党和人民政府同人民群众的关系，我们建议有关领导机关迅速纠正遂平县供销合作社的这种做法。
