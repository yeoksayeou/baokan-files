    Trial Use of Two-Wheeled Double-Share Plow in Paddy Field Cultivation

    Can two-wheeled double-share plows and two-wheeled single-share plows be used for cultivation in southern paddy fields? Zhejiang Province has come to a preliminary answer. At the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Implement Work Conference held in early March, representatives from sixteen typical experimental areas across the province made reports. These reports indicate that two-wheeled double-share plows and two-wheeled single-share plows can basically be used in paddy fields as long as the original iron wheels are replaced with wider wooden wheels, or the iron wheels are widened, and the wheels will not sink into the mud. The experimental results also proved that southern water buffalo and yellow cattle can pull plows side by side after only half a day to two days of training. Its efficiency is about the same as using mules and horses for traction in the north. In sandy loam and clay loam paddy fields in Jinhua, Lishui, Wenzhou and other places, the cultivation efficiency of a double-share plow can抵(=match) two to three local soil plows, the cultivation quality is better than that of soil plows, and the cattle power can also handle it.

    Based on the preliminary experimental results, the representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that two-wheeled double-share plows and single-share plows can basically be used in paddy field areas in the south. In order to further gain experience, the meeting decided to continue to carry out comparative tests on the cultivation efficiency, quality, and yield of two-wheeled double-share plows, two-wheeled single-share plows, and soil plows in various places this year. It was also decided to focus on promoting 200 two-wheeled double-share plows before the spring plowing to expand the experimental area. (Xinhua News Agency)

    试用双轮双铧犁在水田耕作
    双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁在南方水田能不能耕作？浙江省已得出初步答案。在三月上旬举行的浙江省农具工作会议上，全省十六个典型试验地区的代表作了报告。这些报告说明：双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁只要把原来的铁轮换成较宽的木轮，或把铁轮加宽，基本上能在水田里耕作，而且轮子不会陷在泥里。试验的结果还证明：南方的水牛和黄牛，只要训练半天到两天，就可以并排拉犁。它的效率同北方使用骡、马牵引差不多。在金华、丽水、温州等地砂质壤土和粘壤土的水田里，一部双铧犁的耕作效率可抵当地土犁二部到三部，耕作质量比土犁好，牛力也可以胜任。
    根据初步试验的结果，到会代表一致认为：双轮双铧犁和单铧犁在南方水田地区基本能用。为进一步取得经验，会议决定今年继续在各地进行双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁和土犁的耕作效率、质量、产量的对比试验。并决定春耕前重点推行双轮双铧犁二百部，以扩大试验面积。　（新华社）
