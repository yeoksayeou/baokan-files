Since we arrived in the great capital, Beijing, last year, it has been six or seven months now in terms of time. During these six or seven months, we were not only honored to participate in the First Session of the First National People's Congress and the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, but also had the opportunity to visit Beijing, Tianjin, and the Northeast. This has greatly increased our knowledge, further deepened our understanding of the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and at the same time, made us more deeply appreciate the warmth of the motherland's big family.

On the other hand, what we are most grateful for is that during our stay in Beijing, thanks to Chairman Mao's kind concern and instructions for the Tibetan people and us, as well as the specific help of the leaders, the future unification of Tibet was successfully resolved after more than 40 days of consultations and discussions. It was decided to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the nature, tasks, and organizational structure of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region were clearly defined. At the same time, historical issues that we had not resolved in the past were also resolved. The resolution of these relatively complex issues has laid a good foundation and a new beginning for further unity within Tibet and the development of the entire Tibetan construction cause, and will play a significant role in the future development of Tibetan unity. Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and all the leaders at this meeting today.

In the future, we must, on this new basis, resolutely abide by Chairman Mao's instructions of "mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual concession, and mutual assistance" to further strengthen unity, and follow the direction and path indicated by the Constitution of New China, thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and actively do the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. In short, we are determined to redouble our efforts to build a new Tibet with practical actions to repay Chairman Mao, all the leaders, and the people of the motherland for their expectations and trust in us. Finally, after we return to Tibet this time, we hope that all the leading comrades will give us more guidance and help at any time.

    班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞的讲话
    我们自从去年到达伟大的首都北京以来，从时间上来计算，到现在已有六七个月了。在这六七个月当中，我们不仅很荣幸地参加了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和政协第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，并获得了机会在首都北京、天津及东北各地进行了参观。这对我们来说，是增加了不少的新知识，进一步认识到我们祖国的伟大和可爱，同时，也更深刻地体会到祖国大家庭给我们的温暖。
    另一方面，使我们最感激的，就是我们在京留住期间，由于毛主席对西藏人民和我们的亲切关怀和指示，以及各位首长的具体帮助，经过了四十余天的协商讨论，顺利地解决了西藏今后的统一问题，确定了成立西藏自治区筹备委员会，并明确规定了自治区筹备委员会的性质、任务和组织机构等问题，同时还解决了我们过去没有解决的历史悬案问题。这些较为复杂的问题的解决，对我们西藏内部进一步的团结和整个西藏建设事业的发展，奠定了良好的基础和新的开端，对今后西藏团结的发展，是会起很大的作用的。因此，我今天在这个会议上，首先要向我们毛主席和各位首长表示衷心的感谢。
    我们今后要在这个新的基础上，坚决遵守毛主席的指示“互相信任，互相尊重，互相让步，互相帮助”的精神，来进一步做好团结，并遵循新中国宪法所指示的方向和道路前进，彻底执行和平解放西藏办法的协议，积极地做好西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作。总之，我们坚决以实际行动加倍地做好建设新西藏的工作，来答谢毛主席、各位首长和祖国人民对我们的期望和信任。最后，我们这次回藏后，希望各位首长同志们，随时多给我们指导和帮助。
