Sichuan Fuling Pickled Mustard Tuber Bumper Harvest

February and March are the harvest season for pickled mustard tubers in the Fuling area of Sichuan. Everywhere along the hilly area of more than two hundred *li* along both banks of the Yangtze River are pickled mustard tuber fields. Now, the mature tuber heads have emerged from the ground, and hundreds and thousands of farmers are working hard to harvest them on this large tract of land. It is estimated that Fuling County will produce more than 95 million *jin* of pickled mustard tuber heads in 1955, an increase of 30 percent over 1954. Moreover, the quality of the tubers has also improved compared to the past. The original estimate was that 290 *jin* of tuber heads were needed to process one jar (80 *jin*) of pickled mustard tubers, but now, after trial production by various processing plants, only 240-250 *jin* are needed. At present, farmers have sold more than 43.33 million *jin* of tuber heads to the state. In April, Fuling's new pickled mustard tubers will be continuously transported to other places to meet the needs of the people in major cities and industrial and mining areas.

    四川涪陵榨菜丰收
    二三月间，正是四川涪陵一带榨菜丰收的季节。沿长江两岸二百多里长的丘陵地带，到处都是榨菜地。现在，成熟的菜头已经冒出地面，成百上千的农民正在这一大片土地上紧张地进行收割。估计一九五五年涪陵全县可产榨菜头九千五百多万斤，比一九五四年增产百分之三十。而且菜的质量也比过去提高了，原预计二百九十斤菜头才能加工成一坛（八十斤）榨菜，现经各加工厂试做结果只需要二百四、五十斤。目前菜农已把四千三百三十多万斤菜头卖给国家，四月份，涪陵的新榨菜即可源源运往外地，供应各大城市和工矿区的人民需要。
