    The CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee Strengthens Leadership Over the Nanchong Daily
    Yu Jibin
    In order to fundamentally improve newspaper work and enable newspapers to further play the role of collective propagandists and collective organizers, strengthening the Party committee's leadership over newspapers is of decisive significance. The CPC Sichuan Nanchong Prefectural Committee’s leadership and specific assistance to the Nanchong Daily is a good example of this.
    The CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee’s recent leadership over the Nanchong Daily is mainly reflected in giving the newspaper a series of instructions and specific assistance in terms of propaganda guidelines and reporting ideology, changing the past directive and generalized leadership methods. To enable the newspaper to effectively implement the Party committee's intentions, the Nanchong Prefectural Committee has transferred a group of Party member cadres from various counties in the Nanchong Prefecture to enrich the newspaper's editorial department, absorbed responsible persons of the newspaper to attend certain meetings of the Prefectural Committee, and provided convenience in reading documents. Ge Runsheng, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, also frequently conveyed the working intentions of the Prefectural Committee to the responsible persons of the newspaper, timely informed the newspaper of the main work situation and problems in the region, reviewed the newspaper's reporting plans and important manuscripts, reviewed the newspaper proofs and published newspapers, immediately notified the newspaper to correct any shortcomings found, and immediately notified the editorial department to organize reporting on any problems found. For example, on September 27, 1954, Douwei Township in the suburbs of Nanchong City held a grand celebration for the bumper harvest and grain sales conference. Ge Runsheng and Wei Guangping, Secretary-General of the Prefectural Committee, personally went to the newspaper to study with the newspaper reporters and editors and arranged the reporting of this event. Ge Runsheng also wrote commentaries for the newspaper, or gave specific opinions to the newspaper, which were then written by the editorial department. Zhang Ping, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and other members of the Prefectural Committee also enthusiastically participated in the newspaper work and wrote manuscripts for the newspaper. Wei Guangping also frequently helped the newspaper revise manuscripts. When they went to the countryside to guide work, they also always cared about the interview work of the newspaper's local reporters, giving specific guidance and assistance. Because the main leading comrades of the Prefectural Committee attached importance to the newspaper, all departments of the Prefectural Committee also paid attention to using the newspaper to guide work. For example, the Prefectural Committee Office often provided the newspaper with manuscripts and reporting clues about the central work; in addition to writing commentaries and other manuscripts, the Propaganda Department also helped the editorial department compile articles such as "Propaganda Speeches on the Unified Purchase and Sale of Cotton Cloth and the Unified Purchase of Cotton"; the Organization Department wrote news about the development of Party members in the region and commentaries such as "Combining Unified Purchase and Sale to Actively and Prudently Complete the Task of Party Building" and "Combining the Establishment of Cooperatives to Continue to Do a Good Job in Rural Party Building," and helped the newspaper develop correspondents for Party life; the Research Office also wrote many manuscripts for the newspaper on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation; the Industry and Transportation Department also wrote news.
    In order to implement the spirit of the whole Party running newspapers and strengthen the Nanchong Daily's guidance on various aspects of work, the CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee also instructed the newspaper editorial department to maintain closer contact with various departments of the Prefectural Office, various financial and economic units, and various people's organizations, and required the responsible Party member cadres of these departments to actively support the newspaper work. For example, when the internal briefing on the exemplary deeds of Yang Bangfu, an exemplary member of the Huohua Agricultural Production Cooperative and a member of the Communist Youth League in Douwei Township, a suburb of Nanchong City, compiled by the Nanchong Local Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, was sent to the Prefectural Committee for review, Zhang Ping, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, immediately ordered it to be sent to the newspaper for publication and asked the Nanchong Local Working Committee of the Communist Youth League to organize the members of the Communist Youth League in the entire Nanchong region to study it. Now, the relationship between various units of the Nanchong Prefectural Office and the newspaper has become increasingly close. The CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee has also repeatedly instructed the county and district committees to attach importance to the Prefectural Committee's newspaper. The responsible comrades of the county and district committees should carefully study the newspaper, take the lead in writing articles and reflecting the situation, and organize Party members, cadres, and the masses to read the newspaper. In this way, the number of county and district committee secretaries writing for the Nanchong Daily has been increasing. Wang Jie, Secretary of the Nanbu County Committee, Qi Shixun, Deputy Secretary, and Pan Xinyou, Secretary of the Langzhong County Committee, have become active authors of the Nanchong Daily. Some county committee members who did not read the Nanchong Daily in the past, seeing that the content of the newspaper has improved, have also subscribed to the Nanchong Daily.
    It is particularly worth pointing out that the CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee vigorously supported the newspaper in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. In the past, the Nanchong Daily mostly criticized trivial matters, and coupled with the lack of attention to the effect after criticism, the criticism appeared weak and powerless. To make the Nanchong Daily a truly sharp weapon for overcoming shortcomings and mistakes in work, the Nanchong Prefectural Committee specifically supported the newspaper in carrying out criticism with clear goals and specific targets. The Guang'an County Committee neglected to lead the spring sowing work in the unified purchase and sale, and the spring sowing area was much smaller than originally planned. After the Prefectural Committee discovered this, it instructed the Nanchong Daily to criticize the Guang'an County Committee in a very prominent position, and the Nanchong Daily sent reporters to Guang'an to check the effect of the criticism. This criticism reminded the Guang'an County Committee. They conducted a self-examination from top to bottom, took prompt measures, and grasped the leadership of the spring sowing work, and made a public self-criticism in the newspaper. As a result, the spring sowing area in the county not only did not shrink, but also expanded by more than 14,000 dan. The Nanchong Daily systematically reported the effect of the criticism, which promoted the spring sowing work in various counties at that time.
    The Nanchong Prefectural Committee also gave instructions on the propaganda center and specific purpose of the Nanchong Daily in each period, helping the newspaper to achieve clear reporting direction and timely and accurate news. In the early stage of the unified purchase and sale in 1954, the Prefectural Committee clearly pointed out that the key to this work lies in educating cadres and the masses to draw a clear line between classes in order to raise their socialist consciousness. The newspaper successively published eleven special pages, systematically exposing various conspiracies of landlords, remnants of counter-revolutionaries, and illegal rich peasants and profiteers to sabotage the socialist transformation of agriculture; it also published some self-criticism articles of Party members and cadres; at the same time, it systematically introduced the work experience of Douwei Township and Xinjian Township in the suburbs of Nanchong City, which guided the movement in a timely and effective manner.
    All of this shows that as long as the Party committee effectively leads its own newspaper, it will make the newspaper its most effective weapon and greatly improve the work of the newspaper.

    中共南充地委加强了对南充报的领导
    余继滨
    为了从根本上改进报纸工作，使报纸进一步发挥集体宣传者和集体组织者的作用，加强党委对报纸的领导，是有决定意义的。中共四川南充地委会对南充报的领导和具体帮助，是这方面作得较好的一个例子。
    中共南充地委会最近一个时期对南充报的领导，主要表现在从宣传方针、报道思想上给予报纸一系列的指示和具体帮助，改变了过去指令式的和一般化的领导方法。南充地委会为使报纸能很好地贯彻党委意图，已从南充专区各县抽调了一批党员干部充实报纸编辑部，吸收报社负责人列席地委会一定的会议，并在阅读文件上给以便利。地委书记戈润生还经常向报社负责人具体传达地委会的工作意图，及时把全区主要工作情况和问题告诉报社，审查报纸的报道计划和重要稿件，审查报纸大样和已出版的报纸，发现缺点马上通知报社纠正，发现问题立即通知编辑部组织报道。例如一九五四年九月二十七日，南充市郊都尉乡举行盛大的庆贺丰收卖粮大会，戈润生和地委会秘书长卫广平便亲到报社，同报社记者、编辑研究，布置了这一报道。戈润生还为报纸写评论，或给报社提出具体意见，由编辑部撰写。地委副书记张平和地委会其他委员也都热心参加报纸工作，为报纸撰写稿件。卫广平还经常帮助报纸修改稿件。他们下乡指导工作时，也随时关心报社驻当地记者的采访工作，给予具体指导和帮助。由于地委会主要领导同志重视报纸，地委会各部门也都注意运用报纸指导工作。如地委会办公室时常供给报纸关于中心工作的稿件和报道线索；宣传部除副部长牛天鸾撰写评论等稿件外，还帮助编辑部编写了“关于棉布统购统销和棉花统购的宣传讲话”等文章；组织部给报纸写了全区发展党员的新闻和“结合统购统销积极慎重地完成建党任务”、“结合建社继续做好农村建党工作”等评论，帮助报纸发展了党的生活的通讯员；研究室也为报纸写了不少关于农业生产互助合作方面的稿件；工业交通部也写了新闻。
    为贯彻全党办报的精神，以加强南充报对各方面工作的指导，中共南充地委会还指示报纸编辑部同专署各部门、各财经单位、各人民团体保持更密切的联系，并要求这些部门的党员负责干部积极支持报纸工作。如青年团南充地方工作委员会整理的南充市郊都尉乡火花农业生产合作社模范社员、青年团员杨邦辅模范事迹的内部通报，送地委会审查时，地委副书记张平就马上叫送报社发表，并要求青年团南充地方工作委员会组织南充全区的团员学习。现在，南充专署一级机关的各单位和报社的关系已日渐密切。中共南充地委会还一再指示各县委、区委必须重视地委会机关报，县委、区委负责同志应认真学习报纸，带头写稿和反映情况，并组织党员、干部和群众读报。这样，县委书记和区委书记为南充报写稿的日益增加，南部县委书记王杰、副书记齐世勋、阆中县委书记潘辛酉等，已成为南充报的作者积极分子。过去一些不读南充报的县委委员，看到报纸内容有改进，也订阅南充报了。
    特别值得指出的是中共南充地委会大力支持报纸开展了批评和自我批评。过去，南充报批评的多半是一些琐碎事情，加之批评后不注意效果，批评就显得软弱无力。南充地委会为使南充报真正成为战胜工作中的缺点和错误的锐利武器，便具体支持报纸进行目标明确、有的放矢的批评。广安县委在统购统销中忽视对小春播种工作的领导，小春播种面积比原计划缩小很多。地委发现后，就指示南充报以极显著的地位批评了广安县委，南充报并派出记者到广安检查批评的效果。这一批评提醒了广安县委，他们自上而下地进行了检查，火速采取措施，抓紧了对小春播种工作的领导，并在报上作了公开检讨。结果该县小春播种面积不仅没有缩小，还扩大了一万四千多石的面积。南充报系统地报道了批评的效果，推动了当时各县的小春播种工作。
    南充地委会对南充报每一时期的宣传中心和具体目的也有指示，帮助报纸做到报道方向明确，新闻及时、准确。在一九五四年统购统销初期，地委会明确提出这一工作的关键在于教育干部和群众划清阶级界限，以提高他们的社会主义觉悟。报纸就连续发表了十一个专页，比较系统地揭发了地主、反革命残余分子以及不法富农、奸商破坏农业的社会主义改造的各种阴谋活动；还发表了一些党员、干部的检讨文章；同时较为系统地介绍了南充市郊都尉乡、新建乡的工作经验，对运动指导得及时、有力。
    所有这一切都说明：只要党委切实对自己的机关报进行领导，就会使报纸成为自己手中最有效的武器，就会大大改进报纸的工作。
