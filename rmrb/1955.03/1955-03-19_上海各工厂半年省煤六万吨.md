    Shanghai's factories have achieved great results in conserving industrial coal. According to preliminary statistics, more than 60,000 tons of coal have been saved in the six months from September 1954 to the end of February this year.

    Since the launch of coal conservation work in various factories, workers and technicians have made continuous efforts and many new innovations have emerged. Workers in the boiler room of the state-owned Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory created the "double-person mutual assistance coal feeding method" and improved operations, reducing the factory's coal consumption by 15.2%. The jointly-owned Da Xin Zhen Dyeing and Weaving Factory fully utilized "recycled water" and "recycled steam," continuously reducing coal consumption. In February, it saved more than 137 tons of coal. Yang Cunlian, an engineer from the privately-owned Wanli Paper Mill, and employees of the state-owned Shanghai Coal Construction Company researched and installed "flexible grates" on horizontal boilers, reducing coal consumption by 20% and also reducing the labor intensity of the stoker workers.

    上海各工厂半年省煤六万吨
    上海市一千多家工厂节约工业用煤已获很大成绩。据初步统计：从一九五四年九月份起至今年二月底止，六个月来已节约了六万多吨煤。
    各工厂开展节约用煤工作后，由于工人和技术人员不断努力，有了许多新的创造。国营上海绢纺厂炉子间工人创造了“双人互助投煤法”，并改进了操作，使该厂用煤量比以前减少了百分之十五点二。公私合营大新振染织厂充分利用“回水”、“回汽”，使用煤量不断降低，二月份节约用煤达一百三十七吨多。私营万利造纸厂工程师杨存连和国营上海市煤建公司职工研究在卧式锅炉上装置了“活络炉排”后，使用煤量降低了百分之二十，并且减轻了司炉工人的劳动强度。　（本报驻上海记者）
