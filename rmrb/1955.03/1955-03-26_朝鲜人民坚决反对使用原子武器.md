    The Korean People Resolutely Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons
    Han Xueye, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace

    Currently, the entire Korean people unanimously support the resolutions of the Joint Conference of the Central Committee of the United Democratic Fatherland Front and the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace. Together with all peace-loving people worldwide, they are launching a nationwide campaign to sign the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World," which advocates for the destruction of all atomic weapons stored anywhere and calls for an immediate halt to the production of atomic weapons.

    The declaration and "Appeal to the People of the World" from the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council represent a decisive action program for all peace-loving people worldwide in the current situation—where enemies of peace are further creating international tension, rearming West Germany and Japan, and openly preparing for atomic war—to safeguard human life and security, and to protect human civilization and progress.

    The great Soviet Union has consistently advocated using the great discovery of human wisdom—atomic energy—for peaceful purposes. It has already begun utilizing atomic energy in industrial power plants and has achieved tremendous success in this area. Moreover, the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to assist other countries in atomic energy production and technology. However, the ruling groups in the United States are attempting to use atomic and hydrogen weapons as a means of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and threatening and intimidating people, frantically clamoring for atomic war. This has aroused anger worldwide. Last December, the notorious and aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting decided to formulate plans for atomic warfare in Europe and exerted pressure to force European countries to ratify the "Paris Agreements" aimed at rearming West Germany. Especially in the Far East and Asia, American imperialism continues to occupy the southern half of our homeland, obstructing the realization of the Korean people's unanimous desire—peaceful reunification of the fatherland; continues to occupy the territory of our neighbor, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan and Penghu, expanding provocative actions against the Chinese people; attempting to revive the common and vicious enemy of all Asian people—Japanese militarism; and organizing the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    In this way, the American aggressors and their lackeys are carrying out an undisguised policy of launching new wars in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, further intensifying today's international tensions and creating a great threat to peace. Therefore, the struggle against the war conspiracies of atomic maniacs and against the use and production of atomic weapons has become the most urgent and sacred task for all peace-loving people worldwide.

    Especially for the Korean people, who directly experienced the three-year bloody war launched by the American aggressors, peace is so precious and so closely linked to their lives.

    How many of our mothers, wives, and children lost their beloved children, husbands, and parents in this cruel war!

    We can never forget the unprecedented crimes of the American aggressors in slaughtering the Korean people!

    As everyone knows, the Korean people have a long history. They have always been a single nation living in one country, leading harmonious lives, loving culture, loving labor, and also loving peace.

    Today, the Korean people eagerly hope to maintain peace and look forward day and night to the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. To realize this wish, the Korean people have dedicated all their strength to the struggle, and will continue to do so in the future.

    The lofty aspirations and goals of the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World" are fully in line with the interests of all Korean people who love peace and yearn for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    Precisely for this reason, the Korean people, in order to resolutely defend peace and their precious creative labor, are determined to dedicate everything to the cause of maintaining peace. This is how they have responded to the call of the "Appeal to the People of the World."

    The Central Committee of the United Democratic Fatherland Front and the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace decided to join the people of the world in the signature campaign against atomic war and formed the Korean Signature Campaign Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons. Since then, vigorous signature activities have been launched in all provinces, cities, counties, districts (dong), industrial and transportation sectors, construction sites, schools, scientific and cultural institutions, and all other departments, forming a massive movement.

    Now, the Korean people everywhere are holding rallies in support of the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World" and are signing their names on the "Appeal to the People of the World."

    The Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the Academy of Sciences of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Union, and all other mass social organizations and scientific, cultural, and artistic organizations in our country have successively issued statements calling on their members to support the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World" against the use of atomic weapons.

    The signature campaign for the "Appeal to the People of the World" is now underway in all regions of our country. The ranks of peace-loving people signing the "Appeal to the People of the World" are growing day by day. They include the elderly, supported by their grandchildren, advanced producers, farmers, youth, students, religious figures, merchants and entrepreneurs, activists from political parties and social organizations, cultural and artistic workers...

    Train driver and Republic Hero Han Nan-soo said when signing: "It is our sacred duty to stop the crimes of the atomic maniacs. Let the atomic maniacs tremble before our names!" Rural housewife Zheng Yun-sook said: "For the happy life of my dear children, we must overturn the dangerous game of fire played by the atomic maniacs!" The Republic's renowned scientist Choi Sam-ryul said: "Atomic energy must be used for the cause of benefiting humanity!" Republic Meritorious Actor Kim Wan-woo said: "For the brilliant development of art, for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, we must dedicate all our strength to the struggle against the atomic maniacs!" With this determination, they signed their names.

    Everyone who signed unanimously expressed their determination to expose and shatter the conspiracies of those who attempt to launch an atomic war and to suppress it with the power of peace. Their voices are merging with the earth-shaking voices of peace-loving people around the world.

    The Korean people have not forgotten the American interventionists who attempted to use atomic weapons in the Korean War, and the Korean people deeply hate the American atomic maniacs who threaten to use atomic weapons if they re-launch the Korean War. The Korean people are highly vigilant against the conspiracies of the American atomic maniacs.

    We believe that the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki must not be repeated, and the criminal acts of the atomic maniacs are in no way permissible!

    The Korean people firmly believe that the great discovery of human wisdom—atomic energy—must be used for peaceful purposes for the happiness and prosperity of mankind. The valuable achievements made by the great Soviet Union in atomic energy fully guarantee the possibility of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. We warmly support the great Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace and security, in its advocacy of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes, resolutely oppose the attempts of the aggressive bloc headed by the United States to prepare for atomic war, and will vigorously fight to ensure that atomic energy serves the happiness and development of human civilization.

    Today, the strength of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is invincible. This invincible power is a guarantee to stop the crimes of the atomic maniacs and safeguard world peace and security.

    In the past, during the Korean War, the people of Korea and China together shattered the armed interventionists from sixteen countries headed by the United States. We have the experience of defending the freedom and honor of our homeland.

    The Korean people firmly believe that the stronger the world's peace forces, the more firmly peace and freedom will be defended; the stronger our strength, the more thoroughly any enemy conspiracy will be crushed. We also firmly believe that the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland will be gloriously realized.

    While carrying out the signature campaign, the Korean people are further promoting the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and consolidating the democratic base in the northern half. This will greatly encourage the patriotic struggle of the people in the southern half who are fighting against American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang.

    Through this movement against the use of atomic weapons, the entire Korean people will further develop the close internationalist relations with the great Soviet people, the great Chinese people, the people of the fraternal countries, and the peace-loving people of the world; and under the correct leadership of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, they will launch a nationwide struggle to complete and overfulfill the 1955 People's Economic Plan, which guarantees the restoration and development of the post-war people's economy, and they are unanimously rising up to strive for glorious labor in this struggle and to create great achievements.

    朝鲜人民坚决反对使用原子武器
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长  韩雪野
    目前，全体朝鲜人民一致拥护祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会和朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会联席会议的决议，同全世界所有爱好和平人民一起，在全国范围内展开了在世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”上签名的运动，即：主张毁掉贮藏在任何地方的全部原子武器，并主张立即停止制造原子武器。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议的宣言和“告全世界人民书”，是全世界爱好和平人民在目前——和平的敌人进一步制造国际紧张局势、重新武装西德和日本、露骨地准备原子战争——的形势下，为了保卫人类的生命和安全，维护人类的文明和进步的决定性的行动纲领。
    伟大的苏联一贯主张把人类智慧伟大的发现——原子能——用于和平目的，并且已经开始在工业上利用原子能发电站的电力，在这方面已取得了巨大的成就。不仅如此，苏联并表示愿意在原子能的生产和技术方面援助其他国家。但是美国统治集团却企图把原子武器和氢武器作为干涉别国内政和威胁、恫吓人民的手段，疯狂地叫嚣原子战争。这引起了全世界的愤怒。去年十二月，恶名昭彰的侵略性的北大西洋集团理事会会议决定拟订在欧洲进行原子战争的计划，并施加压力强迫欧洲各国批准以重新武装西德为目的的“巴黎协定”。特别是在远东和亚洲，美帝国主义继续侵占着我们祖国的南半部，阻挠朝鲜人民一致的愿望——和平统一祖国——的实现；继续侵占着我们的邻邦中华人民共和国的领土台湾和澎湖，扩大反对中国人民的挑衅行动；企图复活所有亚洲人民共同的凶恶敌人——日本军国主义；组织侵略性的东南亚条约的机构。
    美国侵略者及其仆从，就是这样地在东西半球进行着露骨的发动新战争的政策，使得今天的国际紧张局势进一步紧张，形成了对和平的巨大威胁。因此，反对原子狂人的战争阴谋和反对使用和生产原子武器的斗争，成了全世界所有爱好和平人民的最迫切的任务，也是神圣的任务。
    特别是对直接体验到美国侵略者发动的三年流血战争的朝鲜人民来说，和平会是多么珍贵，多么和他们的生活密切关联。
    我们有多少母亲、妻子和孩子在这次残酷的战争中失去了自己亲爱的孩子、丈夫和父母！
    我们是永远不能忘记美国侵略者屠杀朝鲜人民的旷古未闻的罪行的！
    大家知道，朝鲜人民有着自己悠久的历史，他们一直是生活在一个国家里的单一民族，过着和睦的生活，热爱文化，热爱劳动，也热爱和平。
    今天，朝鲜人民热切地希望维护和平，日夜盼望着祖国的和平统一。为了实现这种愿望，朝鲜人民献出了一切力量进行了斗争，今后也将继续进行这样的斗争。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”的崇高的愿望和目的，是和热爱和平、热望祖国和平统一的全体朝鲜人民的利益完全一致的。
    正因为如此，朝鲜人民为了坚决保卫和平和自己宝贵的创造性的劳动果实，决心为维护和平献出自己的一切。他们就是这样响应“告全世界人民书”的号召的。
    祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会和朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会，决定和全世界人民一道投入反对原子战争的签名运动，并组成了朝鲜反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会。自此以后，各道、市、郡、里（洞），各工业、运输部门，各个工地，各处的学校和科学、文化机关以及其他所有的部门，热烈地展开了签名的活动，并形成了一个巨大的运动。
    现在，朝鲜人民到处进行着支持世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”的集会，并在“告全世界人民书”上签下了自己的名字。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国科学院和朝鲜作家同盟中央委员会等我国所有的群众性的社会团体及科学、文化、艺术组织，连续地发表声明，号召自己部门的成员支持反对使用原子武器的世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”。
      “告全世界人民书”的签名运动现在正在我国全部地区进行着。在“告全世界人民书”上签名的爱好和平人民的队伍日益壮大，那里面有从病床上扶着孙子走出的老人，有先进生产者，有农民，有青年，有学生，有宗教界人士，有商人和企业家，有政党和社会团体的活动家，有文化艺术工作者……。
    火车司机——共和国英雄韩南洙在签名的时候说：“制止原子狂人的罪行是我们神圣的义务。叫原子狂人在我们的名字面前发抖吧！”农村家庭妇女郑允淑说：“为了我亲爱的孩子的幸福生活，必须把原子狂人的危险的玩火把戏打翻！”共和国著名的科学家崔三悦说：“原子能必须用于为人类造福的事业！”共和国功勋演员金完羽说：“为了艺术的光辉的发展，为了祖国的和平统一，我们必须献出一切力量，进行反对原子狂人的斗争！”他们抱着这种决心签下了自己的名字。
    每一个签名的人都一致表示，一定要揭露、粉碎企图发动原子战争的家伙们的阴谋，用和平的力量把它压下去。他们的呼声正和全世界爱好和平人民震天动地的呼声汇合在一起。
    朝鲜人民并没有忘记企图在朝鲜战争中使用原子武器的美国干涉者，朝鲜人民极度憎恨扬言要在重新发动朝鲜战争时使用原子武器的美国原子狂人。朝鲜人民对于美国原子狂人的阴谋怀着高度的警惕。
    我们认为，广岛和长崎的惨剧不能重演，原子狂人的犯罪行为是丝毫不能容许的！
    朝鲜人民坚决认为，人类智慧伟大的发现——原子能，必须用于为了人类的幸福和繁荣的和平目的。伟大的苏联在原子能方面所达到的宝贵的成就，充分地保证了把原子能用于和平目的的可能性。我们热烈拥护世界和平和安全的堡垒——伟大的苏联把原子能用于和平目的的主张，坚决反对以美国为首的侵略阵营准备原子战争的企图，并将为使原子能为人类的幸福和文明的发展而服务进行有力的斗争。
    今天，以伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量是不可战胜的。这种不可战胜的威力是制止原子狂人的罪恶、保卫世界的和平和安全的保证。
    在过去朝鲜战争过程中，朝中两国人民曾一起粉碎了以美国为首的十六个国家的武装干涉者。我们是有着保卫祖国的自由和荣誉的体验的。
    朝鲜人民坚信：世界和平力量越强大，就会坚定不移地保卫住和平和自由；我们的力量越强大，敌人的任何阴谋都会遭到彻底粉碎。我们并且坚信：祖国和平统一的伟业一定会光荣地实现。
    朝鲜人民这次一面进行签名运动，一面进一步促进祖国的和平统一，巩固北半部的民主基地。这将大大鼓舞为反对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮而斗争的南半部人民的救国斗争。
    全体朝鲜人民，通过这次反对使用原子武器的运动，将进一步发展同伟大的苏联人民、伟大的中华人民共和国人民、各兄弟国家人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的国际主义的密切关系；并将在敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的正确领导下，为提前和超额完成保证恢复和发展战后人民经济的三年计划的一九五五年度人民经济计划而进行全民性的斗争，他们正在一致奋起为在这一斗争中进行光辉的劳动、创造伟大的功绩而努力。
