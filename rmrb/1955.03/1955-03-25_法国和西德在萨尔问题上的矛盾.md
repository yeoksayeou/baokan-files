    The US-British bloc, while striving to get France and West Germany to approve the plan to rebuild Hitler's Wehrmacht, has consistently used the Saar issue as a tool to instigate and entice both sides. Recently, as the Paris Accords for the rearmament of West Germany are about to be debated in the parliaments of France and West Germany, the contradictions between France and West Germany on the Saar issue have seen new developments.
    The latest development in the contradictions between France and West Germany on the Saar issue is due to the ruling groups in Paris and Bonn giving their own interpretations of the Saar Agreement in order to get the Paris Accords passed in their respective parliaments, where opinions are divided. At the end of February, Adenauer said in the West German Bundestag: "When the Paris Accords come into effect, the Saar will regain full political freedom, including the right to initiate a movement to amend the Saar Agreement." He also revealed that the United States and Britain had informed him that once the Saar Agreement was passed, "they would abandon their promise to support France's claims on the Saar in the German peace treaty." Adenauer's remarks on the Saar issue immediately triggered a reaction in France. On March 4, the French Foreign Ministry issued a statement reiterating that "after the Saar plebiscite agrees to the European Statute on the Saar, any political activities or propaganda attempting to change the status of the Saar will be illegal." The statement also stated: "The French government has no reason to believe that the publicly stated position and guarantees given by the Allies have changed in any way." In this way, the differences between France and West Germany on the Saar issue, hidden by the Saar Agreement, were exposed.
    Now, although the Adenauer group has forced the West German Bundesrat to approve the Paris Accords despite the dissatisfaction of many parliamentarians with the Saar Agreement, and the Faure government has avoided the demand to re-discuss the Saar issue in the National Assembly before the debate on the Paris Accords in the French Senate, the quarrel over the Saar issue in France and West Germany has not diminished in the slightest. The West German Social Democratic Party has joined some parliamentarians from other parties to sue the Saar Agreement to the Federal Constitutional Court for violating the Bonn Constitution. West German President Heuss has therefore announced that he will temporarily not sign the Paris Accords, but will first "study the constitutional aspects." The French National Assembly has also decided to re-discuss the Saar issue on March 30. A dispatch from Bonn by the Associated Press on March 20 pointed out: "Despite the Bonn parliament's approval of the Paris Accords last week, the Saar issue remains a dangerous sore spot here," and believes that the French and West German "dispute over the Saar issue may explode again publicly."
    What exactly is the Saar issue?
    The Saar was originally German territory, with an area of about 2,000 square kilometers and a population of less than one million, but it has rich coal reserves. Relying on the iron sand of French Lorraine, the Saar can produce two to three million tons of steel annually. For many years, the Saar's resources have been the target of contention between French and German monopoly capital. After the First World War, France gained control of the Saar according to the Treaty of Versailles, and obtained the Saar's coal mines as reparations. As a result of the plebiscite in 1935, the Saar returned to Germany. After the Second World War, French monopoly capital regained control of the Saar, and in collusion with the US-British bloc, gradually took measures to completely monopolize the Saar's industry, trade, finance and tariffs. Politically, the French High Commissioner to the Saar held great power, excluding forces inclined to West Germany. This created a situation in which the Saar was effectively detached from Germany politically and economically.
    In the eyes of French monopoly capital, the Saar is a piece of fat meat within reach. They not only extract huge profits from the Saar's coal and steel production every year, but also rely on the Saar's market and export sales to obtain a considerable amount of foreign exchange income to reduce France's huge trade deficit. Moreover, French monopoly capital also regards control of the Saar as an important bargaining chip for maintaining a balanced position against West German steel monopoly groups. By retaining control over the Saar's coal and steel production, they can account for 34 percent of the total coal and steel production of the Western European Coal and Steel Community, which can compete with the 35 percent share held by West Germany; if they lose control of the Saar, then France's share will be reduced to 27 percent, while West Germany's will increase to 42 percent, and the position will be very different. Therefore, French monopoly groups are naturally unwilling to give up the interests of the Saar.
    In order to ensure its control over the Saar, after the war, the French ruling group has insisted that West Germany recognize the status quo of the Saar as a condition for France to agree to rearm West Germany. In order to facilitate the rearmament, the West German ruling group decided to make temporary concessions on the Saar issue. Therefore, France and West Germany signed the Saar Agreement last October as a solution to the Saar issue. This agreement stipulates that a "European Statute" will determine the status of the Saar. In fact, it is to recognize France's economic control over the Saar and the Saar's political separation from Germany. The agreement also stipulates that "this statute cannot be disputed again before the conclusion of the German peace treaty after being approved by a plebiscite." In the view of the French ruling group, the status of the Saar has thus been determined. They believe that the implementation of the Paris Accords will make the conclusion of the German peace treaty a distant prospect. However, West German militarist forces have other plans. They do not believe that the agreement should be binding on them forever. For example, former Nazi General Heusinger, who is slated to be the Chief of Staff of the future West German "Wehrmacht," once said without concealment that West Germany's current concessions on the Saar and other issues are only temporary, "When there is an army of 500,000, Germany will naturally know how to make the Council of Ministers (of the Western European Union) listen to it." It can be seen that a single Saar Agreement has not solved the contradictions between France and West Germany on the Saar issue. On the contrary, there is a hidden opportunity for endless disputes between France and West Germany.
    The dark deal made by the French and West German ruling groups on the Saar issue seriously endangers the national interests of France and Germany. For France, it is like fostering a tiger to cause future trouble. Historical experience has repeatedly proven that once German militarism is revived, let alone the Saar, even France's own territory will inevitably be trampled on by the iron hooves of the German "Wehrmacht." On the other hand, this approach is not in the interests of the German people either. Because the revival of German militarism also threatens the security of the German people. Moreover, the Adenauer group's separation of the Saar from Germany is an act of selling out Germany's sovereignty over the Saar. It is for these reasons that the Saar Agreement has aroused strong opposition from the French and West German public, and even the West German government parties are in serious division on this issue. Members of the West German Free Democratic Party and the Refugee Party voted against the Saar Agreement in the Bundestag debate.
    In order to ease domestic dissatisfaction, Adenauer tried his best to explain that the Saar Agreement in his mind was a temporary contract, but this explanation failed to eliminate domestic dissatisfaction with his treasonous behavior, but caused great anxiety in the French parliament.
    What is most noteworthy is the conspiracy played by the United States on the Saar issue. The US ruling group uses the contradictions between France and West Germany on the Saar issue to manipulate it, both to urge France and West Germany to quickly pass the Paris Accords, and to seek its own interests from it. Everyone knows that the Saar Agreement is the implementation of the "Europeanization of the Saar" plan proposed by the Dutch representative Van Naters in September 1953, and the so-called "Europeanization" is just a cover to facilitate the US intervention and the realization of its control. Not long ago, West German news agencies revealed a secret plan of the United States: the US Department of Defense is planning to turn the Saar into the largest and most concentrated base for the US military in Europe.
    It is very clear that subordinating the solution of the Saar issue to the US plan to split Germany and rearm West Germany can only cause damage to the national interests of Germany and France, form a powder keg of international conflict in Western Europe, threaten European security, and benefit US monopoly capital. To solve the Saar issue, we must first reject the plan to rearm West Germany and establish a unified, democratic and peaceful Germany. On this premise, France and Germany will be able to seek lasting understanding on the basis of recognizing each other's legitimate interests. As Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic pointed out: "A unified, democratic, peace-loving and autonomous Germany can reach a peaceful and lasting understanding with France on the Saar issue. This understanding must be based on the recognition of the fact that the Saar region is an indivisible part of Germany, while the interests of France should be taken into account in terms of security and economy."

    法国和西德在萨尔问题上的矛盾
    谭文瑞
    美英集团在竭力促使法国和西德批准重建希特勒国防军的计划时，一直把萨尔问题作为两头进行挑唆、引诱的工具。近来，在重新武装西德的巴黎协定在法国和西德都要交付议会辩论的时候，法国和西德在萨尔问题上的矛盾有了新的发展。
    法国和西德在萨尔问题上的矛盾的最近发展，是由于巴黎和波恩的统治集团，为了使巴黎协定能够在意见纷纭的议会中得到通过，对萨尔协定各作了自己的解释。阿登纳二月底在波恩联邦议院中说：“当巴黎协定生效时，萨尔就可以恢复充分的政治自由了，这种自由包括发动修改萨尔协定的运动的权利”。他还透露说：英美两国已通知他，一旦萨尔协定得到通过，“它们将放弃关于在对德和约中支持法国对萨尔要求的诺言”。阿登纳对萨尔问题的这些言论，立即在法国引起了反应。法国外交部三月四日发表声明，重申“在萨尔公民投票同意关于萨尔的欧洲法规之后，任何企图改变萨尔地位的政治活动或宣传将是非法的。”声明同时表示：“法国政府没有理由认为盟国后来公开表明的立场和给予的保证已有任何改变。”这样法国和西德用萨尔协定掩盖起来的在萨尔问题上的分歧就暴露出来了。
    现在，虽然阿登纳集团已不顾许多议员对萨尔协定的不满，强使西德参议院批准了巴黎协定，富尔政府也躲过了在法国参议院辩论巴黎协定以前在国民议会中重新讨论萨尔问题的要求，但是在法国和西德，关于萨尔问题的争吵丝毫也没有因此消减。西德社会民主党已联合了一些其他党派的议员向联邦宪法法院控告萨尔协定违反波恩宪法，西德总统休斯因此宣布他将暂不签署巴黎协定，要先
  “研究一下宪法方面的情况”。法国国民议会也决定要在三月三十日重新讨论萨尔问题。合众社三月二十日从波恩发出的电讯就指出：“尽管波恩议会上周批准了巴黎协定，萨尔问题仍然是这里的一个危险的痛处”，并认为法国和西德“关于萨尔问题的纠纷有再度公开爆炸的可能”。
    萨尔问题究竟是个什么问题呢？
    萨尔原是德国的领土，面积约二千平方公里，居民不上百万，但却拥有丰富的煤藏。靠了法国洛林的铁砂，萨尔每年可以生产二三百万吨钢铁。多年来，萨尔的资源一直成为法德垄断资本争夺的目标。第一次世界大战后，法国根据凡尔赛和约取得了对萨尔的控制权，并取得了萨尔的煤矿作为赔偿物资。一九三五年举行公民投票的结果，萨尔重归德国。第二次世界大战后，法国垄断资本重新控制了萨尔，并在和美英集团勾结下，逐步采取措施，完全垄断了萨尔的工业、贸易、金融和关税。在政治上，法国驻萨尔的高级专员掌握了大权，排斥了倾向西德的势力。这就造成萨尔在政治和经济上实际脱离德国的局面。
    在法国垄断资本眼中，萨尔是一块到口的肥肉。它们不但每年从萨尔的煤钢生产榨取巨额的利润，而且靠了萨尔的市场和产品外销，可以得到一笔可观的外汇收入，来减少法国的巨额贸易逆差。不仅如此，法国垄断资本还把控制萨尔作为维持对西德钢铁垄断集团的平衡地位的重要法码。它们保有对萨尔煤钢生产的控制，就能在西欧煤钢联营的煤钢总产额中占到百分之三十四，可以同西德所占的百分之三十五相抗衡；如果失去对萨尔的支配，那么法国的份额将减为百分之二十七，而西德则增到百分之四十二，地位就悬殊了。因此，法国垄断集团自然不肯放弃萨尔的利益。
    为了确保它对萨尔的控制，战后法国统治集团一直坚持要西德承认萨尔的现状作为法国同意重新武装西德的条件。西德统治集团为了便于重新拿起武器，决定在萨尔问题上作暂时的让步。于是法国和西德就在去年十月签订了萨尔协定，作为解决萨尔问题的办法。这项协定规定以一个“欧洲法规”来确定萨尔的地位。实际上就是承认法国对萨尔的经济控制以及萨尔在政治上脱离德国。协定并且规定“这项法规在由公民投票通过以后，在缔结对德和约以前不能再有异议”，在法国统治集团看来，萨尔的地位就这样确定了。它们认为，巴黎协定的实施，会使对德和约的缔结成为遥遥无期的事情。但是西德的军国主义势力却另有打算。它们并不认为，协定对于它们应该永远保持约束力。例如，被内定为未来西德“国防军”参谋总长的前纳粹将领许辛格就曾毫不隐讳地说过：西德目前在萨尔等问题上所作的让步只是暂时的，“当有了五十万大军之后，德国自会懂得如何使（西欧联盟）部长理事会听从自己。”由此可见，一纸萨尔协定一点也没有解决法国和西德在萨尔问题上的矛盾，相反的，在这里面隐伏着法国和西德之间无限纠纷的契机。
    法国和西德统治集团在萨尔问题上所做的这笔黑暗交易，严重地危害着法国和德国的民族利益。对法国来说是养虎贻患。历史经验早已一再证明，德国军国主义一旦复活起来，别说萨尔，就连法国自己的领土也免不了遭受德国“国防军”铁蹄的蹂躏。另一方面，这种做法也不符合德国人民的利益。因为德国军国主义的复活同样也威胁德国人民的安全。而阿登纳集团让萨尔从德国分离出去，这又是出卖德国对萨尔主权的行为。正是因为上述原因，萨尔协定引起了法国和西德公众的强烈反对，甚至西德政府党派集团也在这个问题上陷于严重的分裂。西德自由民主党和难民党的议员就在联邦议院的辩论中投票反对萨尔协定。
    阿登纳为了缓和国内不满情绪，极力说明他心目中的萨尔协定是暂时性的契约，但是这种解释并没有能消除国内对他卖国行为的不满，却在法国议会中引起了极大的不安。
    最值得注意的是美国在萨尔问题上玩弄的阴谋。美国统治集团利用法国和西德在萨尔问题上的矛盾，操纵其间，既驱使法国和西德从速通过巴黎协定，又想自己从中取得利益。人人都知道，萨尔协定就是荷兰代表范·纳特斯一九五三年九月间提出的“萨尔欧洲化”计划的实施，而所谓“欧洲化”就是便于美国插足和实现其控制的一个幌子而已。不久以前，西德的通讯社曾透露出美国的一项秘密计划：美国国防部正打算把萨尔变成为美军在欧洲的最大和最集中的基地。
    事情很明白，把萨尔问题的解决服从于美国分裂德国、重新武装西德的计划，就只能造成对德国和法国民族利益的损害，形成西欧国际冲突的一个火药库，威胁欧洲安全，得利的是美国垄断资本。要解决萨尔问题，必须首先拒绝重新武装西德的计划，建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国，在这个前提下，法德双方将有可能在承认相互的合法利益的基础上，求得持久的谅解。正如德意志民主共和国格罗提渥总理所指出过的：“一个统一、民主、爱好和平和自主的德国同法国在萨尔问题上求得和平和持久的谅解是可能的。这种谅解必须建立在承认下列事实的基础上，即萨尔区是德国不可分割的一部分，同时在安全问题上和在经济上应照顾法国方面的利益。”
