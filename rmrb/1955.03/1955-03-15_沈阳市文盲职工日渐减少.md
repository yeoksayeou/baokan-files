The amateur cultural education work for workers in Shenyang has greatly developed in recent years along with the development of economic construction. By the end of 1954, more than 25,500 workers in the city had shaken off their illiteracy and become cultured workers. Some of them have already reached the cultural level of senior high school and junior high school, and some are still studying in elementary and advanced elementary classes. The proportion of illiterate workers in the machinery system alone has decreased from 34% in 1952 to 20%.

The improved cultural level of the vast number of workers has created conditions for studying technology and improving production. Some workers can now read books and newspapers and check product quality according to blueprints. Some workers use scientific principles to create or improve production tools. Lin Fugui, a mechanic at the Shenyang Transformer Factory, created a sand-carrying machine after learning culture, which can reduce three working procedures, save seven laborers, and increase work efficiency twelve times compared to the past. Among the students studying at the Shenyang Electrician United School, 50 have made inventions or improvements to production tools. A total of 374 pieces of production tools and operation methods have been improved by 2,300 students in six amateur schools in the machinery system. These workers with cultural knowledge have played a backbone and leading role in the production of various factories. According to the statistics of six amateur schools in the machinery system, 37 workers have been promoted to technicians and management cadres after improving their cultural level.

    沈阳市文盲职工日渐减少
    沈阳市职工业余文化教育工作，几年来随着经济建设的发展有了很大发展。截止一九五四年底，市内职工已有二万五千五百多名摆脱了文盲状态，变成了有文化的工人。他们有的已具备了高中、初中的文化水平，有的还在初小、高小班学习。仅机械系统文盲职工就由一九五二年的百分之三十四，减少到百分之二十。
    广大职工由于提高了文化，给钻研技术、提高生产创造了条件，有些职工已经能看书、看报，按图纸检查产品质量，有些职工运用科学原理，创造或改进了生产工具。沈阳变压器厂机械员蔺福贵，学了文化以后，创造了带砂机，可给工作减少三道工序，能节省七名劳动力，比过去提高工作效率十二倍。在沈阳电工联中学校学习的学员中，有过发明创造或改进生产工具的学员就有五十人。机械系统六个业余学校二千三百多名学员，一共改进生产工具和操作方法达三百七十四件。这些有文化知识的职工，在各厂生产上都起了骨干带头作用。根据机械系统六个业余学校的统计，职工提高文化后，被提拔做技术员和管理干部的有三十七名。
