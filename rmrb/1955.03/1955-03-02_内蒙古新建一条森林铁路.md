    A New Forest Railway Built in Inner Mongolia
    The Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia are home to boundless forests. In the past, timber harvested here was transported down the mountains by rafting. Rafting timber was costly, wasteful, and could not be done year-round. To solve this problem, the Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry decided to build a forest railway in the Arxan forest area, using mechanical transport. This forest railway starts from Yiershi, follows the Halha River, passes through many high mountains and meadows, and extends to the treasure trove of forests full of larch trees – Daheigou, with a total length of eighty kilometers. After two years of construction, the railway has now been fully completed.
    This is a well-equipped forest railway. Once it is put into operation, it will be able to transport more than 300,000 cubic meters of timber annually to meet the needs of the country's economic construction.
    Starting last winter, a large number of administrative cadres and technicians from the Shuangyashan, Wangqing, Tianqiaoling and other forest industry bureaus in Northeast China have been transferred to participate in the management of this railway. At present, they are actively carrying out all preparations before production. In the severe cold of minus 30 degrees, the workers are repairing the lines to lay a good foundation for safe production. (Hu Yafeng)

    内蒙古新建一条森林铁路
    内蒙古大兴安岭有着一望无际的森林。过去，在这里采伐的木材，都靠流送把它运下山来。流送木材，成本高，耗损多，还不能实行常年作业。为了解决这个问题，林业部内蒙古森林工业管理局决定在阿尔山林区修筑森林铁路，利用机械运输。这条森林铁路由伊尔施起，沿着哈拉哈河，经过许多高山峻岭和草甸洼地，一直伸展到长满一色落叶松的森林宝库——大黑沟，全线长达八十公里。这条铁路经过两年来的修筑，现在已经全部竣工。
    这是一条设备完善的森林铁路。它投入生产后，每年能运出三十万立方公尺以上的木材，供祖国经济建设需要。
    去冬开始，便由东北双鸭山、汪清、天桥岭等森林工业局先后调了大批行政干部和技术人员，参加管理这条铁路。目前他们正在积极进行生产前的一切准备工作。职工们在零下三十度的严寒中补修线路，给安全生产打下良好基础。　（胡亚峰）
