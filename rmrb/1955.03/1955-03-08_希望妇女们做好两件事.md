Hoping Women Will Do Two Things Well

He Xiangning

The 1955 "March 8th" International Women's Day has arrived. I think we should greet this great festival more meaningfully. I sincerely hope that all sisters will pay attention to doing the following two tasks well:

Women are the most compassionate, and mothers love their children even more. They hope that their children can live peaceful, happy, healthy, and beautiful lives. They hope that their children can be spared from war disasters and epidemic disasters. However, American imperialism is preparing to use atomic weapons, attempting to destroy the peaceful and happy lives of people around the world, and subjecting children to cruel disasters. This is something that mothers resolutely oppose. They know that only by defending peace can they protect the healthy and beautiful lives of their children. Originally, atomic energy has two uses: it can be used for war or for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union is now using atomic energy for peaceful purposes in power stations, which can improve the material life of the people and promote the development of science, medicine, industry, and agriculture in the world. This benefits all mankind, and peace-loving women all over the world enthusiastically support it. However, American imperialists do not want us to build our country into a prosperous and strong nation. They are doing everything possible to conspire to sabotage the peaceful life of our people. As a woman, as a mother, for the sake of her children's future and her children's happiness, she must oppose atomic war and actively participate in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.

Secondly, in order to protect the daily safety of children, women across the country must also do their best to protect children from epidemic disasters. Therefore, women across the country should pay attention to the health of children. Spring is the season when epidemics occur, and children are ignorant, so mothers should pay more attention. As the old saying goes, "Prevention is better than cure." Common knowledge such as fire prevention, poisoning prevention, first aid, emergency treatment, bandaging, etc., should be learned by women all over the country, and efforts should be made to promote hygiene and epidemic prevention work so that children will not be harmed and children will always be happy.

We women account for half of the country's population. I hope everyone will mobilize and strive to do the above two tasks well. Commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day in this way is more meaningful and more valuable. Our 600 million people across the country must mobilize to oppose American imperialism's use of atomic weapons; and pay attention to protecting mothers and protecting children's health.

    希望妇女们做好两件事
    何香凝
    一九五五年的“三八”国际妇女节已经到来了。我以为我们要更有意义地迎接这个伟大的节日，我很希望各姊妹们注意做好下面的两项工作：
    妇女，是最慈悲为怀的，母亲，更热爱她的儿女。她们希望孩子们都能过和平幸福的健康美好的生活。她们希望她的孩子们都能免除战争灾害和疫病灾害。然而美帝国主义正在准备使用原子武器，企图破坏世界人民和平幸福的生活，使孩子们受到惨酷的灾害，这是母亲们坚决反对的。她们知道，只有保卫和平，才能保护儿女的健康美好的生活。本来原子能有两种用途，可以用之于战争，也可以用之于和平目的。苏联现在就是把原子能用之于电力站的和平用途的，它能提高人民的物质生活，促进世界上的科学医学及工农业的发展。这样造福于全人类，全世界热爱和平的妇女都热烈拥护。但是美帝国主义者是不愿我们把自己的国家建设得繁荣富强的，它千方百计地阴谋破坏我国人民和平生活。作为一个妇女，作为一个母亲，为了儿女的将来和儿女的幸福，一定要反对原子战争，要积极参加反对使用原子武器的签名运动。
    其次，全国妇女为了保护儿童的日常安全，还要尽力使儿童免受疫病灾害。所以全国妇女都应该注意儿童们的健康。春天正是疠疫发生的季节，小儿无知，做母亲的更要注意。古语云：“有备无患”。防火、防毒、救伤、救急、包扎等等普通常识，全国妇女都应学习，并努力推动卫生防疫工作，使儿童不致受到伤害，使儿童永远幸福。
    我们妇女占全国人口之一半。希望大家都动员起来，努力做好以上两项工作，这样来纪念“三八”国际妇女节，才更有意义，更有价值。我全国六亿人民都要动员起来反对美帝国主义使用原子武器；并注意保护母亲及保护儿童的健康。
