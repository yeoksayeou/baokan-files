The No. 1 mine of the Yongchuan Coal Mine in Sichuan has steeply inclined coal seams, consuming a large amount of pit props. Pit prop costs account for more than 24 percent of the workshop's costs. Due to some employees' lack of attention to conservation and an imperfect material management system, the waste of pit props is very common. Many people, for the sake of convenience, cut the props in the middle when replacing materials, making the good material unusable. Some people do not clarify the specifications of the materials before cutting them, and when they are taken down the mine and do not fit, they are cut again, which wastes both labor and materials. Others, fearing trouble, take more materials during their shift, and if they don't use them all, they throw them in the ditch to rot or be buried by sand and stones. This not only increases product costs and wastes wood, but also directly hinders underground ventilation and main roadway transportation.

The serious waste of pit props attracted the attention of the Youth League branch of the No. 1 mine. At a branch committee meeting held in December last year, a special discussion was held, and it was decided to mobilize young workers to strictly conserve, starting with the repair group, which uses a lot of pit props.

On December 8th, the Youth League branch held a symposium for young people in the repair group. During the symposium, Hu Daiwen, a member of the Youth League, proposed establishing a savings team. The Youth League branch adopted Hu Daiwen's suggestion, and the Party, administration, and trade union also supported it. In less than a week, the young people in the repair group rushed to sign their names, willing to be members of the savings team. Considering that the young people's lack of technical skills might cause quality and safety problems, the leadership hired district director Jia Shangqing and veteran technical worker Zhang Yinqing as technical instructors, and young clerk Zhang Zezhuo, who is in charge of materials, as a recorder to tally the savings figures. On December 17th, the Party branch officially named the team the "Youth Savings Team" at a general meeting.

The resounding title of "Youth Savings Team Member" inspires every young person. On December 18th, before the work whistle blew, the young people in the repair group were already dressed in their work clothes, waiting at the mine entrance to go to work. Team member Luo Yuangui had already prepared a small flatcar to carry materials out of the shift.

On this day, after finishing their work, the team squeezed out time to tidy up the pit props. Everyone pulled the beams, carried the pillars, and passed the props. There was so much wood! But there were only two flatcars to move the wood. If they carried it by hand, one person could only carry one small piece of wood, and the larger ones required two people to carry. If they made a few extra trips, it would be too far from the mine entrance and would affect the production of the next shift. What to do? Wang Kexiang's team couldn't find a flatcar, so they loaded three cars of material with sand cars. Wang Fangxiang even used a spare coal car. Team leader Luo Yuangui tallied the results of the day's pit prop cleanup: six main roadway beams and pillars, thirteen beams, twenty-two props, eleven chute materials, five sets of pan materials, and twenty cleats, worth more than eighty-one yuan in total.

Yang Senlin, the deputy captain of the Youth Savings Team, noticed that the main roadway pillars, as thick as rice bowls and two meters long, were often damaged by rocks, and people would simply replace all three pieces of material in the entire set. He thought: wouldn't it be a great savings to use these two good pieces! How to use them? He pondered alone. During the middle shift the next day, Yang Senlin went to the Pei Lian main roadway in the second district, first using two pieces of wood to prop up the beam, removed the damaged one, replaced it with a new one, and then removed the two pieces he had used to prop it up. He successfully installed three sets in a row. This not only saved six new pieces of material but also improved work efficiency. The workers all learned from his experience.

Once, Youth Savings Team members Hu Daiwen and Zhong Chengyou accepted the task of "digging an empty roadway" in the second chute of the third district (opening a roadway in the mined-out area is called digging an empty roadway). In the past, when digging empty roadways, props and lagging were dropped together and used as backfill. This time, they started recovering props in a gap of only three to five inches. However, the pressure of the rock was great, and most of the props could not be removed without blasting. This stumped Hu Daiwen. After work, he and Zhong Chengyou studied the problem, took a rope from the material warehouse, and the next day they used the rope to lasso the props and lagging, one pulling from above and the other blasting from below. As soon as the cannon fired, the rocks rolled down, and the wood was pulled up the chute. In this way, more than 230 props and 360 pieces of lagging, worth more than 100 yuan, were saved in the second chute of the third district.

The Youth Savings Team members not only strictly conserved themselves, but more importantly, they wanted to create a culture of conservation throughout the workshop. Soon after, the Qingfeng team's savings team was also established. Tang Rongfu asked to join the savings team, saying, "Can't we adult workers save as well!" Liao Chonghe, an old worker in the production team, saw that the rocks had collapsed, and he painstakingly chipped away the sand to create a foothold, saving two pillars. The old workers in the Qingfeng team picked up the nails one by one from the ground, saving 22 kilograms of nails, 10 kilograms of iron wire, and some standing boards in a month. The road maintenance team was unwilling to fall behind and saved 15 kilograms of spikes. The boiler room that heated the bath water also used rotten wood scraps and tree roots, saving more than 200 kilograms of bituminous coal.

In forty working days, the Youth Savings Team of the No. 1 mine saved a total of 55.58 cubic meters of pit props, saving the motherland 2,779 yuan in wealth.

    为祖国节约坑木的青年节约队
    邓寿全
    四川永川煤矿一矿井是急倾斜煤层，耗用坑木多。坑木费占车间成本百分之二十四以上。由于部分职工不重视节约，和材料管理制度不健全，坑木浪费现象很普遍。很多人图方便，换料时拦腰砍，使好料不能再用了。有些人没有弄清用料规格就开料，拿下井去不合用时再砍，既费人力又费材料。有的怕麻烦，进班多领料，用不完就丢在水沟里任其腐烂或被砂石埋掉。这不仅增加产品成本和浪费木材，而且还直接妨碍着井下通风和大巷运输。
    坑木的严重浪费，引起了一矿井青年团支部的注意，在去年十二月召开的支部委员会上，进行了专题讨论，决定发动青工严格节约，并从使用坑木较多的修理组开始。
    十二月八日，团支部召开了修理组青年座谈会。座谈中，青年团员胡代文提出了建立节约队的建议。团支部采纳了胡代文的建议，党、行政、工会也支持。一周的时间还不到，修理组的青年们都争先签上了自己的名字，愿作节约队员。领导上考虑到青年们因技术不高可能引起质量和安全问题，为他们聘请了区主任贾尚清、老技术工人张银清为技术指导员，并请管材料的青年职员张泽焯为记录员，统计节约数字。十二月十七日，党支部在大会上正式命名了“青年节约队”。
      “青年节约队员”这个响亮的称号，鼓舞着每个青年。十二月十八日，上班的气笛还没叫，修理组的青年们早已穿好工作服，在井口等着上班了。队员罗元贵早已准备好了出班带料的小平车。
    这一天，这个班干完了活，挤出时间来收拾坑木。大家拉的拉梁担，抬的抬柱子，传的传撑子。木料放在一起可真多啦！但是推木料的小平车却只有两个，用手拿，小的木料一人只能抱一根，大的还要两人抬；多跑两次吧！离井口太远，还会影响下一班的生产。怎么办呢？王克祥小组找不到小平车就用砂车装了三车料，汪方祥还利用了空余的一个炭车。小组长罗元贵清算当天收拾坑木的成果：大巷梁柱六根，梁担十三根，撑子二十二根，顺槽料十一根，盘料五架，踩子二十个，共值八十一元多。
    青年节约队的副队长杨森林，看到菜碗粗、两公尺长的大巷柱子，往往有一根被岩石摧坏了，人们就把整架厢的三根料都不用了，另换上新的，他想：这两根好料利用起来不就是很大的节约吗！咋个利用呢？他独自在沉思着。第二天的中班，杨森林到了二区的培连大巷，先用两根木料将梁担撑住，取下坏的一根，换上新的，再将先撑的两根取掉。他接连架了三架都成功了。这不仅节约了六根新料，还提高了工作效率。工人们都学习了他的经验。
    有一次，青年节约队员胡代文和钟成友接受了三区二顺槽“打空心路”的任务（已采过的?子从中开条路叫打空心路）。以往打空心路时，撑子和岩子一起落下当作墟砂充填。这次，他们在仅仅只有三、五公寸的空隙里开始回柱，取草鞋板。可是岩子的压力大，绝大多数的撑子取不掉，必须放炮后才能取下来。这可把胡代文难住了。下班后，他和钟成友研究，在材料库领了一根绳子，第二天他们用绳子将撑子、草鞋板套住，一个在上面拉，一个在下面放炮，炮一响岩石滚下了，木料却拉上了顺槽。这样，三区二顺槽里就节约了二百三十多根撑子，三百六十多个草鞋板，价值一百多元。
    青年节约队员们不仅要自己实行严格的节约，而且更重要的是要在全车间掀起节约的风气。接着，清风组的节约队也成立了。唐荣福要求参加节约队说：“我们成年工人不是也同样可以节约吗！”生产组的老工人廖充和看到岩子塌了，不怕麻烦地把砂刁掉，又另打脚窝，节约了两根柱子。清风组的老工人们把钉子一颗颗地从地上拾起来，一个月就节约了钉子二十二公斤，铁丝十公斤，还有一些站板。道班队也不愿落后，节约了道钉十五公斤。烧洗澡水的锅炉房也利用了烂木渣和树根子，节约了二百多公斤烟煤。
    一矿井青年节约队在四十个工作日里，共节约坑木五十五点五八立方公尺，为祖国节约了二千七百七十九元的财富。
