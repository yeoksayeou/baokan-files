    Supplying Farmers with High-Quality Cotton Seeds
    Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Xingtai Special Districts in Hebei Province are major cotton-producing areas. This year, these three special districts plan to expand cotton fields by hundreds of thousands of mu. To ensure the completion of this year's cotton planting plan, supply and marketing cooperatives in these three special districts have prepared a large quantity of high-quality cotton seeds for cotton farmers. According to incomplete statistics from early February, the three special districts have already prepared more than 71.27 million jin of cotton seeds. When purchasing cotton, local supply and marketing cooperatives paid attention to mobilizing cotton farmers to select and retain cotton seeds, explaining the principles of "large mother, fat offspring" to the masses. Therefore, most cotton farmers carried out stack selection. Local supply and marketing cooperatives also set up ginning machines to process the selected seed cotton for cotton farmers, so that cotton farmers could carry out seed selection in a timely manner.
    In order not to delay cotton farmers' sowing, local supply and marketing cooperatives promptly transported the selected cotton seeds to the grassroots supply points one after another. In early February, Shulu County transported more than 400,000 jin of cotton seeds to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. Some areas also printed "Cotton Seed Instructions" to ensure full seedlings in cotton fields and to make full use of high-quality cotton seeds. (Wang Bingjun, Feng Yingjie)

    供应农民优良棉种
    河北省邯郸、石家庄和邢台三个专区是河北省的主要产棉区。今年，这三个专区计划扩大棉田数十万亩。为了保证完成今年的植棉计划，这三个专区的供销合作社为棉农准备了大量优良棉种。据二月上旬的不完全统计，三个专区已经备妥棉种七千一百二十七万多斤。各地供销合作社在收购棉花的时候，就注意发动棉农选留棉种，向群众说明了“母大子肥”等道理。因此，大部分棉农进行了垛选。各地供销合作社还设立轧花车，为棉农加工选好的籽棉，使棉农能及时进行粒选。
    为了不误棉农播种，各地供销合作社及时把选好的棉种陆续运往基层供应点。二月初，束鹿县就运到基层供销合作社四十多万斤棉种。有些地区还印发了“棉种说明书”，保证使棉田全苗，充分利用优良棉种。　（王秉钧  冯英杰）
