Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: According to TASS, the Bonn Federal Parliament held the third reading debate and vote on the Paris Agreements on February 27th.

After passing the Paris Agreements on the second reading at a meeting late on the 26th, the Social Democrat Wehner moved to postpone the third reading debate on the Paris Agreements. His motion was supported by another Social Democrat representative, Menzel, but was rejected by the reactionary majority in the Federal Parliament. Adenauer decided to turn the third reading into an empty formality, striving to complete the "legal procedures" as quickly as possible.

The first speaker in the third reading debate was Bonn Chancellor Adenauer, whose speech was very brief. He apparently considered the failure of his lengthy speech on the 25th, in which he said that Britain and the United States would not support France's demands regarding the Saar issue, which aroused protests in France and put the British and American diplomatic services in a very awkward position.

The next speaker was Brentano, chairman of Adenauer's Christian Democratic parliamentary group, whose speech offered nothing new compared to Adenauer's.

The first speaker in the debate, German Social Democratic Chairman Ollenhauer, disrupted Adenauer's wishful thinking of smoothly ending the discussion and approval of the Paris Agreements. Ollenhauer began by saying that Adenauer's supporters' passage of the Paris Agreements in the second reading was against the will of the majority of the German people. He vehemently condemned the members of the coalition government parties for their repeated slanderous attacks on the people's movement demanding negotiations for German reunification and opposing the Paris Agreements. He pointed out that, according to the results of the "German Declaration" signature campaign, a majority of West German residents favored negotiating the issue of reunification before approving the Paris Agreements. Ollenhauer refuted Adenauer's view that the Soviet Union would agree to negotiate the issue of German reunification after the Paris Agreements were approved, as well as the claim that the Soviet Union was unwilling to hold free elections in Germany. Ollenhauer spoke about the recent documents on the German issue published by the Soviet government, and he emphasized: I affirm that the approval of the Paris Agreements cannot solve the issue of reunification, nor can it solve the issues of security and the Saar. On the contrary, the approval of the Paris Agreements will endanger national reunification and European peace.

The next speaker was Dehler, chairman of the Free Democratic parliamentary group. Although Dehler intentionally concealed the actual content of the Paris Agreements, he sharply criticized the Saar Agreement. He also denounced Adenauer's means of exerting pressure on political leaders who disagreed with him.

After speeches by members of other parliamentary groups, the Federal Parliament began voting on the Paris Agreements. As in the second reading, the third reading vote also divided the Paris Agreements into four bills for voting. Ignoring the will of the vast majority of the German people, the reactionary majority in the Federal Parliament hastily approved the Paris Agreements.

### 违反德国广大人民的意志  西德议院匆匆批准巴黎协定

    违反德国广大人民的意志
    西德议院匆匆批准巴黎协定
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：波恩联邦议院二月二十七日举行巴黎协定的三读辩论和投票表决。
    联邦议院在二十六日深夜的会议上二读通过巴黎协定后，社会民主党的维纳动议延期进行巴黎协定的三读辩论。他的动议得到社会民主党的另一个代表孟泽尔的支持，但是为联邦议院的反动多数所否决。阿登纳决定把三读变成空洞的形式，力求尽速完成“法律手续”。
    三读辩论中首先发言的是波恩总理阿登纳，他的演说非常简短。他显然考虑到了他在二十五日发表的冗长演说的失败，那一次他说，英国和美国将不支持法国关于萨尔问题的要求，这番话在法国引起纷纷抗议，并且使英国和美国的外交方面陷于很尴尬的境地。
    接着发言的是阿登纳的基督教民主党的议会党团主席勃伦塔诺，他的发言同阿登纳的发言相比没有什么新东西。
    第一次在辩论中发言的德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔打乱了阿登纳要一帆风顺地结束讨论和批准巴黎协定的如意算盘。奥伦豪尔一开始就说，阿登纳的支持者们在二读中通过巴黎协定是违反大多数德国人民的意愿的。他猛烈地谴责联合政府中各党派的议员对要求谈判德国的重新统一和反对巴黎协定的人民运动所一再进行的诽谤攻击。他指出，根据“德国宣言”签名运动的结果，西德的多数居民是赞成在批准巴黎协定之前谈判重新统一问题的。奥伦豪尔驳斥了阿登纳认为在巴黎协定批准后苏联就会同意就恢复德国统一问题进行谈判以及所谓苏联不愿意在德国举行自由选举的说法。奥伦豪尔谈到了苏联政府最近发表的关于德国问题的文件，他强调说：我确认批准巴黎协定既不能解决重新统一的问题，也不能解决安全问题和萨尔问题。相反的，批准巴黎协定将危及国家的重新统一和欧洲的和平。
    接着发言的是自由民主党议会党团主席戴勒。戴勒虽然有意掩饰巴黎协定的实际内容，但是他尖锐地抨击了萨尔协定。他也斥责了阿登纳对同他意见不同的政治领袖所采取的施加压力的手段。
    在其他议会党团的议员发言后，联邦议院开始就巴黎协定进行表决。像在二读时一样，三读的表决也把巴黎协定分为四个法案投票，联邦议院反动多数不顾绝大多数德国人民的意志，匆匆地批准了巴黎协定。
