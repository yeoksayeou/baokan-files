    Yangchang River Irrigation Project Successfully Completed
    The largest water conservancy project in Guizhou Province, the Yangchang River Irrigation Project in Pingba County, has been successfully completed and has begun to supply water for farmers' spring plowing. This irrigation project is located on the Yangchang Dam south of Pingba County, and the irrigation area includes eight townships and seventy-eight natural villages, as well as the local state-owned Pingba Farm and the Pingba County Farm. In the past, although there was a Yangchang River here, the river surface was two to three zhang lower than the fields. People could see the water but could not use it, and the fields were threatened by drought every year. After the completion of this irrigation project, the water from the river can be diverted to irrigate 44,000 mu of farmland, permanently eliminating the threat of drought; it can also increase the country's grain production by 4.2 million jin per year. This irrigation project started in June 1954, lasted nine months, and was completed at the end of February 1955. The major and minor structures of the project include 583 river dams, inverted siphons, and 22 large and small canals with a total length of 79 kilometers. After the completion of this project, because the water source is guaranteed, farmers can turn dry land into paddy fields. Because natural irrigation is implemented, a large amount of manual labor for water hauling can be saved and used for land processing, soil improvement, technology improvement, and manure accumulation.

    羊昌河灌溉工程胜利完工
    贵州省最大的水利工程——平坝县羊昌河灌溉工程已经胜利完工，并已开始输水供给农民春耕。这个灌溉工程位于平坝县城南边的羊昌大坝上，灌溉范围包括八个乡又七十八个自然村，以及地方国营平坝农场和平坝县农场的田地。过去，这里虽然有一条羊昌河，但河面比田面低两三丈，看得见水用不着水，田地年年遭受旱灾威胁。这个灌溉工程修成后，可引出河里的水灌溉四万四千亩田地，永远免除旱灾威胁；并可每年为国家增产四百二十万斤粮食。这个灌溉工程自一九五四年六月开工，历时九个月，到一九五五年二月底完工。工程的大小建筑物有拦河坝、倒虹吸管等五百八十三座，渠道大小二十二条共长七十九公里。这个工程修成后，由于水源有了保证，农民们可以把旱田变成水田，由于实行自然灌溉，可以节省大批车水的人工，用到土地加工、改良土壤、改进技术和积肥等方面去。　（张克）
