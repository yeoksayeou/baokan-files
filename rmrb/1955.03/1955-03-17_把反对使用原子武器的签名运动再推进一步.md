    Further Advance the Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons
    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Vienna from March 11th to 13th, discussing the launch of a worldwide movement against the preparation for atomic warfare and the holding of the World Peace Congress in May of this year. The meeting adopted two important resolutions, calling on people of all countries to exert all their strength to demand the destruction of nuclear weapons, universal disarmament, and inviting peace-loving people from all countries to participate in the World Peace Congress to discuss urgent actions to safeguard peace.
    The resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council express the common aspirations of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, and it will further promote the people of all countries to intensify their struggle against the imperialist aggressive bloc's preparations for atomic warfare and strive for peace. The Chinese people resolutely support the resolutions and appeals of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.
    The statement of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The World Peace Council's 'Appeal to the People of the World' advocating the destruction of atomic weapons and the cessation of their manufacture has awakened the conscience of all people in every country who abhor the prospect of destructive war." Since the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued the "Appeal to the People of the World" on January 19th, people in all countries, whether in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, or in capitalist or colonial countries, have enthusiastically launched a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. This firm and unified action of the peace-loving people of all countries is a great force for defending world peace.
    The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has received enthusiastic support and a widespread response from the Chinese people. According to preliminary statistics released by the Chinese People's Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons, in the twenty-five days from February 14th to March 10th alone, 194,879,988 people participated in the signature campaign. The number of signatures in all large and medium-sized cities has reached more than 80 percent of the total population of each city. Now this movement is unfolding on a grand scale in the vast rural areas of the country. The enormous achievements gained so rapidly demonstrate the Chinese people's love of peace and their firm opposition to the sinister plans of the imperialist atomic maniacs to prepare for atomic warfare. At the same time, it also shows that the Chinese people are determined to unite with the peace-loving people of the world to jointly undertake the sacred task of defending world peace and preventing atomic war.
    The way to eliminate the threat of atomic war and safeguard peace has long existed. The new proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons put forward by the Soviet government in its statement of February 18th fully embody the common aspirations of peace-loving people of all countries, thereby greatly encouraging the confidence of peace-loving people in the struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    However, the American aggressive bloc, disregarding the will of the peace-loving people of the world and the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for peace, is continuing to frantically prepare for atomic war. They are also obstructing and attempting to undermine the disarmament conference held in London. American officials are making more and more frequent clamors about atomic war. Dulles, who once announced at the Bangkok Conference that atomic bombs should be regarded as "conventional weapons," openly stated at a press conference on March 15th that the United States would use atomic weapons as so-called "normal" weapons at will. In order to deceive the people, Dulles, while clamoring, also insisted that the use of atomic weapons "could not be the use of so-called weapons of mass destruction." At the same time, in Paris, General Gruenther, Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, in his eagerness to hurl atomic weapons at the people of the world, even stated that Western military commanders have the direct right to use atomic weapons to launch a war. The reason why the American atomic maniacs are becoming increasingly rampant is clearly encouraged by the attitude of certain ruling figures in Britain. They not only follow the American "policy of strength" and decide to manufacture hydrogen bombs, but British Prime Minister Churchill even stated in Parliament that the United States can use British bases to launch atomic war without consulting Britain. The policy of expanding atomic armaments and preparing for atomic war by the Anglo-American aggressive bloc is clearly incompatible with the task of the London Disarmament Conference. Therefore, they not only openly stated that "there is no room for compromise on the issue of disarmament," but also American representative Lodge left London for New York while the conference was still in progress. This shows that they are trying their best to make the disarmament conference completely fail.
    The American aggressive bloc's clamor for atomic war is by no means a manifestation of strength. The reason why they clamor incessantly is precisely because they know that the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war. Their clamor cannot intimidate the peace-loving people of all countries. On the contrary, this can only make the peace-loving people of all countries more aware of the vicious ambitions of the atomic maniacs, and continue to strive for the struggle against the atomic war plans of the American aggressive bloc. This sinister plan must be stopped, and can be stopped.
    The statement of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The people of all countries are able to issue a loud cry, so that the government of no country dares to ignore their opposition." Therefore, in the face of the increasingly intensified atomic war threat of the American aggressive bloc, the peace-loving people of all countries must more forcefully advance the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, and use the great power of the unity of the people themselves to overwhelm the atomic war plan of the American aggressive bloc. This criminal plan must be stopped, and it can be stopped.

### 把反对使用原子武器的签名运动再推进一步

    把反对使用原子武器的签名运动再推进一步
    世界和平理事会常务委员会于三月十一日至十三日在维也纳举行会议，讨论了展开反对准备原子战争的全世界运动和在今年五月间举行世界和平大会的问题。会议通过了两项重要决议，号召各国人民发挥一切力量来要求销毁核子武器、普遍裁减军备，并邀请各国拥护和平人士参加世界和平大会，讨论维护和平的迫切行动问题。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议表达了全世界亿万爱好和平人民的共同愿望，它将进一步推动各国人民为反对帝国主义侵略集团准备原子战争、争取和平而加紧斗争。中国人民坚决支持世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议和号召。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会声明中指出：“主张销毁原子武器和停止制造原子武器的世界和平理事会告全世界人民书，在世界上的每一个国家里都唤醒了一切憎恶毁灭性战争的前景的人们的良心。”自从世界和平理事会常务委员会于一月十九日发表了“告全世界人民书”以来，不论是在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家中，或者是在资本主义国家或殖民地国家中，各国人民都热烈地展开了反对使用原子武器的签名运动。各国爱好和平人民的这种坚决一致的行动是保卫世界和平的伟大力量。
    反对使用原子武器签名运动得到了中国人民的热烈支持和广泛响应。据中国人民反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会所公布的初步统计，仅自二月十四日到三月十日止的二十五天中，就已有一亿九千四百八十七万九千九百八十八人参加了签名。所有大中城市的签名人数都已达到各城市总人口的百分之八十以上。现在这个运动正以波澜壮阔的规模向全国广大农村展开。这种迅速获得的巨大成绩，说明了中国人民热爱和平，坚决反对帝国主义原子狂人们准备原子战争的罪恶计划。同时这也表明，中国人民决心同全世界爱好和平人民团结一致，共同把保卫世界和平、制止原子战争的神圣任务担当起来。
    消除原子战争威胁、保卫和平的道路是早已存在着的。苏联政府在二月十八日发表的声明中所提出的关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的新建议，就完全体现了各国爱好和平人民的共同愿望，从而大大地鼓舞了爱好和平人民要求禁止原子武器斗争的信心。
    但是，美国侵略集团却不顾世界爱好和平人民的意志和苏联争取和平的努力，正继续疯狂地准备原子战争。他们还正在阻挠和企图破坏在伦敦举行的裁军会议。美国官方人士正在更加频繁地叫嚣原子战争。曾经在曼谷会议上宣布要把原子弹当作
  “常规武器”的杜勒斯，在三月十五日的记者招待会上更公然表示，美国要把原子武器当作所谓“正常”武器来随意投射。为了欺骗人民，杜勒斯一面叫嚣，一面还硬说使用原子武器“不可能是使用所谓大规模毁灭性武器”。同时在巴黎，北大西洋集团军队总司令、美国将军格伦瑟为了急于向世界人民投掷原子武器，甚至表示西方军事指挥官直接有权使用原子武器来发动战争。美国原子狂人们之所以越来越猖狂，显然是受到了英国某些当政人物的态度的鼓励。他们不但追随美国的“实力政策”决定制造氢弹，而且英国首相邱吉尔竟然在议会中表示美国可以不同英国商量而利用英国的基地来发动原子战争。美英侵略集团这种扩张原子军备和准备原子战争的政策，和伦敦裁军会议的任务显然是不相容的。因而它们不但公然表示“在裁军的问题上是没有妥协余地的”，并且美国代表洛奇在会议还在继续举行的时候就离开伦敦回纽约去了。这表明，它们是极力想使裁军会议完全陷于失败。
    美国侵略集团的原子战争的叫嚣绝不是有力量的表现。他们之所以叫嚣不绝，正是因为他们知道和平势力大于战争势力。他们的叫嚣是吓不倒各国爱好和平的人民的。相反的，这只能使各国爱好和平的人民更加认清原子狂人们的恶毒野心，再接再厉地为反对美国侵略集团的原子战争计划而斗争。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会的声明指出：“各国人民是能够发出响亮的呼声，使得没有一个国家的政府敢于无视他们的反对的。”因此，在美国侵略集团日益加紧其原子战争威胁的情况下，各国爱好和平人民必须更加有力地推进反对使用原子武器的签名运动，以人民自己团结一致的伟大力量，来压倒美国侵略集团的原子战争计划。这种罪恶的计划是必须被制止，而且是能够被制止的。
