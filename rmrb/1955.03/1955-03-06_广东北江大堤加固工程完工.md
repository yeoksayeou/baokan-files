Guangdong Beijiang Embankment Reinforcement Project Completed

The Guangdong Beijiang Embankment reinforcement project, which began on December 20th of last year, was fully completed on February 24th of this year. A total of more than 75,000 civilians from northern Guangdong, central Guangdong, and Guangzhou participated in the construction of this project, using a total of 3.48 million cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone. During the construction process, the civilians launched a labor emulation drive, producing more than 5,000 embankment-building heroes and model work teams.

Beijiang is one of the major rivers in Guangdong Province. The Beijiang Embankment is located on the left bank of the Beijiang River, with the embankment line running from Shijiao in Qingyuan County to Shakou in Nanhai County, a total length of sixty-six kilometers. After this comprehensive reinforcement, the threat of floods to the lives and property of more than two million people and more than one million mu of farmland in Guangzhou, Qingyuan, Sanshui, Nanhai, Panyu, and Hua County has been greatly reduced.

    广东北江大堤加固工程完工
    广东省北江大堤加固工程从去年十二月二十日开始，到今年二月二十四日已全部完工。参加修建这项工程的共有粤北、粤中和广州市民工七万五千多人，全部工程共用土、沙、石三百四十八万公方。在施工过程中，民工们展开劳动竞赛，涌现出五千多个修堤功臣和模范工作队。
    北江是广东省境内主要河流之一。北江大堤位于北江左岸，堤线由清远县石角到南海县沙口，全长六十六公里。经过这次全面加固后，大大减轻了洪水对广州市及清远、三水、南海、番禺、花县二百多万人民生命财产和一百多万亩农田的威胁。
