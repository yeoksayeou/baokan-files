    [From our newspaper] The Ministry of Construction Engineering convened a design and construction work conference from February 4th to 24th to summarize the work of 1954 and determine the work policy and tasks for 1955. The conference was attended by administrative leaders, technical personnel, and trade union cadres from various Engineering Administration Bureaus, Engineering Bureaus, State-owned Civil Engineering and Construction Companies, and various design institutes, as well as comrades from relevant universities, the Academy of Sciences, and relevant central departments who were invited to attend, totaling more than 370 people. At the meeting, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, Wan Li and Zhou Rongxin, respectively, gave reports on design and construction work, and Minister Liu Xiufeng made a summary. Bo Yibo, Director of the State Construction Commission, also attended the meeting and gave a report.
    In 1954, the Ministry of Construction Engineering began to shift from undertaking general civil buildings to industrial construction. In terms of design, it gathered and developed technical forces, completed the design of millions of square meters, improved the quality of design, and reduced costs to some extent. In terms of urban construction, it formulated overall planning schemes for key cities and detailed planning schemes for some cities. In terms of construction, state-owned construction enterprises completed 103.23 percent of the planned workload (111.1 percent if unplanned tasks are included), reduced costs by more than 210 billion old currency units, and reduced engineering costs by more than 10 percent compared with 1953. The quality of key projects also improved significantly in the second half of the year, basically meeting quality standards. In particular, some construction units have more conscientiously and systematically learned and adopted the Soviet Union's advanced management system and advanced construction methods, and have gained relatively complete experience in industrial and civil construction.
    In accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies for the construction industry, and studying the spirit of the Soviet Union's All-Union Conference of Construction Workers, the conference launched criticism and self-criticism, exposing shortcomings and errors in its work. The meeting held that the main shortcomings in the design area were: first, the design of many buildings deviated from the fundamental principles of suitability and economy, excessively pursuing forms such as "palaces" and "temples" and false and luxurious decorations. This bourgeois formalism and retrogressive tendencies have caused great waste; second, design personnel and leaders of design departments did not pay enough attention to standard design work, and lacked unified leadership and organization, so the quantity of standard designs was not large and the quality was not high; third, there was a lack of planning in the cultivation and use of design forces, and it could not yet adapt to the needs of construction. In terms of construction, the most prominent shortcomings were that the construction was very uneven, neglecting construction preparation work, resulting in on-site chaos; there was a great waste of materials, labor, machinery, and working capital in the construction process, and engineering costs were still very high; quality accidents and personal accidents were still quite serious.
    In 1955, the workload of the Ministry of Construction Engineering's contracted projects increased by 38.45 percent compared with 1954, of which high-grade structures increased by 43.3 percent, and factory building construction increased by 78.99 percent. These are all large-scale, technically complex, and time-pressed projects with more stringent quality requirements.
    In order to complete this year's tasks, the meeting decided: First, design personnel must overcome bourgeois formalism and retrogressive ideas, and carry out designs in accordance with the principles of suitability, economy, and, where possible, beauty; they must systematically study the Soviet Union's complete set of industrial designs, and actively carry out the design of standard designs and standard components; technical responsibility system and drawing review and other systems should be established in the design departments. Second, actively and steadily promote industrialized and mechanized construction, and strengthen the planning and construction of construction bases; coordinate the setting up of regional and on-site processing and prefabrication factories to prepare conditions for the large-scale development of prefabricated components; strengthen the management of mechanized construction, improve the utilization rate, and reduce charging standards. Third, conscientiously do a good job in construction preparation and strive for relatively balanced construction. Fourth, implement economic accounting system, and strive to reduce engineering cost and expenses. Launch a mass anti-waste struggle. Fifth, continue to improve project quality and greatly improve labor productivity. It is necessary to focus on solving the technical problems in the construction of basic engineering waterproof, roof leakage, cracks, and water, heating, electrical, and sanitary engineering, and reduce quality accidents.
    The meeting emphasized that strengthening ideological and political leadership is the primary key to completing the task. It is also necessary to strengthen learning, and organize all cadres to conscientiously study Comrade Khrushchev's report at the All-Union Conference of Construction Workers and other relevant documents.

    建筑工程部召开设计及施工工作会议
    揭发浪费和质量低劣现象
    并确定了一九五五年工作方针和任务
    【本报讯】建筑工程部从二月四日到二十四日召开设计及施工工作会议，总结了一九五四年的工作，确定了一九五五年的工作方针和任务。参加会议的有各工程管理局、工程局、国营土木建筑公司和各设计院的行政负责人、技术人员和工会干部，还有应邀出席的各有关高等学校、科学院和中央各有关部门的同志，共三百七十多人。会上由建筑工程部副部长万里、周荣鑫分别作了设计与施工工作的报告，由刘秀峰部长作了总结。国家建设委员会薄一波主任也到会做了报告。
    一九五四年，建筑工程部从承担一般民用建筑开始转入工业建筑。在设计方面，集结和发展了技术力量，完成了数百万平方公尺的设计任务，提高了设计质量，造价有所降低。在城市建设方面，制订了重点城市的总体规划方案和一部分城市的详细规划方案。在施工方面，国营建筑企业完成工作量计划的百分之一百零三点二三（如包括计划外的任务，为百分之一百十一点一），降低成本旧币二千一百余亿元，使工程造价比一九五三年降低百分之十以上，重点工程的质量在后半年也有显著改进，基本上符合质量标准。特别是有些施工单位比较认真地系统地学习和采用了苏联的先进管理制度和先进施工方法，取得了进行工业建筑和民用建筑的比较成套的经验。
    会议根据党对建筑事业的方针政策，并学习苏联全苏建筑工作者会议的精神，展开了批评和自我批评，揭发了工作中的缺点和错误。会议认为：在设计方面的主要缺点，一是许多建筑物的设计，脱离了适用和经济的根本原则，过多地追求“宫殿”“庙宇”等形式和虚假豪华的装饰，这种资产阶级形式主义和复古主义倾向，已造成很大的浪费；二是设计人员和设计部门领导人对于标准设计工作重视不够，缺乏统一的领导和组织，因而标准设计的数量不多、质量不高；三是对于设计力量的培养和使用缺乏计划性，还不能适应施工的需要。在施工方面，最突出的缺点是施工很不均衡，忽视施工准备工作，形成现场混乱；在施工过程中材料、人工、机具和流动资金都有很大浪费，工程成本仍然很高；质量事故和人身事故还相当严重。
    一九五五年建筑工程部承包工程的工作量比一九五四年增加百分之三十八点四五，其中高级结构增加百分之四十三点三，工厂厂房建筑增加百分之七十八点九九，这些都是规模宏大、技术复杂、进度紧张的工程，质量要求更加严格。
    为了完成今年的任务，会议决定：一、设计人员必须克服资产阶级形式主义和复古主义思想，按照适用、经济和在可能条件下讲求美观的原则进行设计；要有系统地学习苏联成套的工业设计，积极进行标准设计和标准构件的设计；在设计部门要建立技术责任制和图纸会审等制度。二、积极稳步地推行工厂化机械化施工，加强建筑基地的规划和建设；统筹设置区域型和现场型的加工预制工厂，为大量发展预制构件准备条件；要加强机械施工的管理，提高利用率，降低收费标准。三、认真做好施工准备，争取比较均衡的施工。四、贯彻经济核算制，努力降低工程造价和成本。开展群众性的反浪费斗争。五、继续改善工程质量，大力提高劳动生产率。要抓紧解决基础工程防水、屋面漏雨、裂缝及水暖电气卫生工程等施工中的技术问题，减少质量事故。
    会议强调指出：加强思想政治领导，是完成任务的首要关键。并且要加强学习，组织全体干部认真学习赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑工作者会议上的报告及其他有关文件。
