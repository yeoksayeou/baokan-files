    A Single Sweet Potato Weighs Fifty-Seven and a Half Jin

    Guangdong Province has successfully gained experience in grafting sweet potatoes with moonflowers. The South China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee have decided to vigorously promote this method throughout the province in the future.
    Moonflower grafting of sweet potatoes is a creative invention of agricultural technicians in our country in sweet potato production, using Michurin agricultural science theory. This method can double sweet potato production.
    The moonflower is a climbing ornamental plant, belonging to the Convolvulaceae family, along with morning glories and sweet potatoes. This plant was originally a perennial plant growing in the tropics, but when transplanted to the cold north, it becomes an annual plant. Its appearance is very similar to the morning glory, but its branches and leaves are more lush than the morning glory. Growing in fertile soil, the plant can be two zhang tall. This plant is sparsely planted throughout China, generally only as a garden hedge.
    In 1950, the Zhejiang Agricultural College began grafting sweet potatoes with moonflowers, obtaining a yield of more than 30 jin per sweet potato plant. Subsequently, agricultural departments, agricultural technical schools, and agricultural science workers in Guangdong Province also conducted such experiments one after another, and all achieved success. In 1953, the Maoming Agricultural School's trial planting resulted in a sweet potato yield of 52 jin per plant. In 1954, the Zhongkai Agricultural School's trial planting resulted in a yield of 57 and a half jin per plant. The experimental results prove that moonflower grafting of sweet potatoes is fully applicable to the Guangdong region.
    Sweet potatoes are the main coarse grain in Guangdong Province, with a planting area of more than 13 million mu and an annual output equivalent to 3 billion jin of rice. However, due to backward cultivation techniques, the yield per unit area has always been very low, with an average yield of only 800 to 900 jin of sweet potato tubers per mu throughout the province. If calculated based on the moonflower grafting sweet potato trial planting results, with 800 plants per mu, each mu can harvest more than 20,000 jin. It may not be possible to reach the above-mentioned trial planting level in large-scale land production, but at least the yield per mu can reach about 5,000 jin. Therefore, the widespread promotion of moonflower grafting sweet potatoes is an effective method for increasing sweet potato production at present.
    The South China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently decided to vigorously promote the moonflower grafting sweet potato method throughout Guangdong Province, requiring that universal trial planting begin throughout the province this year, to lay a good foundation for further universal promotion next year. Specifically, each agricultural production cooperative with sweet potato planting conditions is required to trial plant five or six mu this year, and state-owned farms (including agricultural experiment farms) should plant even more. Mutual aid teams and general individual farmers should also conduct small-scale land trial planting. The decision requires agricultural departments, agricultural demonstration farms, and technology extension stations in various places to quickly learn and master grafting techniques, and quickly and effectively teach this technique to trial planting agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers, and find ways to supply moonflower seeds and superior sweet potato seedlings, as well as bamboo frames for the seedlings and vines to climb after grafting. The decision also instructs the Department of Agriculture to organize relevant personnel from the South China Agricultural College, the South China Academy of Agricultural Sciences Research Institute, and agricultural technical schools to form a special research group to be responsible for technical practical guidance, and to conduct further research to fully prepare technically for future development.
    The Ministry of Agriculture recently notified agricultural science research institutes (or stations), agricultural experiment farms, and special county farms in Central South, East China, Southwest and other regions, as well as Hebei, Shandong, Henan and other provinces, to conduct moonflower grafting sweet potato experiments. The Ministry of Agriculture will also transfer personnel from the experimental units of various provinces to Guangdong Province to observe and learn the method of moonflower and sweet potato grafting.

    一株甘薯重五十七斤半

    广东省试用月光花嫁接甘薯已获得成功经验，中共中央华南分局和广东省人民委员会作出决定，今后要在全省内大力推广。
    月光花嫁接甘薯是我国农业技术工作者运用米丘林农业科学理论在甘薯生产方面的一种创造性的发明，采用这个方法可以成倍地提高甘薯的产量。
    月光花是一种攀缘性的观赏植物，和牵牛花、甘薯等同属旋花科。这种植物原是热带生长的一种多年生植物，移植到寒冷的北方就变成了一年生植物。它的外形很像牵牛花，可是枝叶比牵牛花茂盛，生长在肥沃的土壤中，植株能有两丈高。这种植物在我国各地都有零星种植，一般都只当作庭园绿篱。
    一九五○年，浙江省农学院开始用月光花嫁接甘薯，获得了每株甘薯三十多斤的产量。接着广东省的农业部门和农业技术学校、农业科学工作者也先后进行了这种试验，都相继获得成功。一九五三年茂名农业学校试种结果一株甘薯产量达五十二斤，一九五四年仲恺农校试种结果获得一株五十七斤半的产量。试验结果证明月光花嫁接甘薯完全适用于广东地区。
    甘薯是广东省的主要杂粮，全省种植面积约有一千三百多万亩，年产量约折稻谷三十亿斤。但由于栽培技术落后，单位面积产量一向很低，全省每亩平均仅产薯块八、九百斤，如果根据月光花嫁接甘薯试种结果以每亩种八百株计算，每亩可收两万斤以上；在大面积土地上进行生产可能达不到上述试种水平，但至少每亩产量也能达五千斤左右；因之月光花嫁接甘薯的普遍推广是当前提高甘薯产量的一个有效的方法。
    中共中央华南分局和广东省人民委员会最近决定要在广东全省内大力推广月光花嫁接甘薯的办法，要求今年在全省范围内开始普遍试种，为明年更进一步的普遍推广打好基础；具体要求今年每个有种植甘薯条件的农业生产合作社都要试种五、六亩，各国营农场（包括农业试验场）更要多种一些，互助组及一般单干农民也要进行小块土地的试种。决定要求各地农业部门，农业示范场、技术推广站要迅速学会掌握嫁接技术，并将这种技术迅速而有效地传授给试种的农业生产合作社、互助组及单干农民，并设法供应月光花种籽和优良的甘薯种苗及嫁接后苗蔓攀缘所需的竹架等。决定又责成农业厅组织华南农学院、华南农业科学院研究所及农业技术学校等有关人员成立专门研究小组负责技术上的实际指导工作，并再作进一步的研究，为今后的发展充分作好技术准备。
    农业部最近通知中南、华东、西南等地区及河北、山东、河南等省的农业科学研究所（或站）、农业试验场、专县农场都进行月光花嫁接甘薯的试验。农业部并将调各省试验单位的人员到广东省观摩学习月光花和甘薯嫁接的方法。
