State Allocates Funds to Support Spring Plowing for Farmers in Disaster Areas

    In areas of Hubei Province that suffered from floods last year, preparations for spring plowing and production are currently underway. To help farmers in disaster areas solve various difficulties in production, the state has issued a total of more than 500 billion old yuan in loans for draft animals and farm implements, advance seed purchase funds, and relief funds before spring plowing. These funds have already been issued or are in the process of being issued. All economic departments in the province are also actively preparing the supply of various means of production to support spring plowing in disaster areas. According to statistics from the Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan districts, in addition to the 60.7 million jin of oilseed cakes and a large number of seeds and farm implements already prepared, they are continuing to purchase and transfer large numbers of draft animals, seeds, and other means of production from non-disaster areas in other provinces or in this province, to ensure timely and sufficient supply when the spring plowing season arrives.
    Farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Hubei Province, under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have formulated annual or spring production plans and are currently working hard to complete these plans.

    国家拨款支援灾区农民春耕
    湖北省去年遭受水灾的地区，目前正在积极进行春耕生产的准备工作。为了帮助灾区农民解决生产中的各种困难，国家在春耕前发放耕牛、农具贷款和种籽预购款以及救济款等共旧币五千多亿元，这批款项目前已经或者正在发放。全省各经济部门为支援灾区春耕生产，也在积极准备各种生产资料的供应，据荆州、黄冈、孝感三个专区统计，目前除已准备了六千零七十多万斤饼肥和大批的种籽、农具以外，还在继续从外省或本省非灾地区收购和调运大批耕牛、种籽和其他生产资料，以保证春耕季节一到做到及时和足量的供应。
    湖北省受灾地区的农民，在共产党和人民政府领导和扶助下，已制订了全年或春季生产计划，目前正在为完成这个计划而努力。
