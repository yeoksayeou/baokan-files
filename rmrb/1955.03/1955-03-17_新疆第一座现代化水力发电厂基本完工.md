Xinjiang's First Modern Hydroelectric Power Plant Basically Completed

The basic construction of the Ulabai Hydropower Plant in Xinjiang has been basically completed. After the thaw, high-voltage lines will be erected from Ulabai to Urumqi, and it is expected to start supplying electricity in September or October this year.

The Ulabai Hydropower Plant is Xinjiang's first modern hydroelectric power plant. The plant's water diversion canal is seven kilometers long, with a total excavation of more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. The power generation equipment in the plant is a new type of product manufactured in our own country. After this power plant starts operating, it will form a unified power grid with the Urumqi Power Plant, fully supplying the electricity needs of various enterprises and residents in Urumqi.

Construction of this power plant began in the winter of 1951. The main canal project was completed at the end of 1952, and equipment installation began in the second quarter of 1954. The first hydro-generator was successfully installed in late December. Throughout the entire project, the People's Liberation Army soldiers who undertook the construction task, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and perseverance, persisted in construction in the freezing cold weather, overcame technical difficulties, and successfully completed various civil construction tasks. During the installation of equipment, relevant departments of the Central Government sent technicians to guide the soldiers in installing hydraulic machinery and its auxiliary equipment, and built large-scale flood control projects, which accelerated the progress of the project.

    新疆第一座现代化水力发电厂基本完工
    新疆乌拉拜水电厂的基本建设工程已基本完工，开冻以后，就要架设由乌拉拜至乌鲁木齐的高压线路，预计在今年九、十月间开始送电。
    乌拉拜水电厂是新疆第一座现代化水力发电厂。电厂引水渠长达七公里，共挖掘了三十多万土方和石方。厂内发电设备是我国自己制造的新式产品。这座电厂开工以后，将和乌鲁木齐电厂组成一个统一的电网，充分供应乌鲁木齐市各企业和市民用电的需要。
    这座电厂是在一九五一年冬季开始施工的，一九五二年年底完成了主要的渠道工程，一九五四年第二季度开始安装设备，到十二月下旬第一台水轮发电机安装成功。在整个工程进行中，担任建筑任务的人民解放军战士们，发扬了坚苦奋斗的革命精神，在天寒地冻的日子里坚持施工，并克服了技术上的困难，胜利地完成了各项土木建筑任务。在安装设备中，中央有关部门曾派去技术人员，指导战士们安装了水轮机械及其附属设备，并修建了规模巨大的防洪工程，加速了工程进度。
