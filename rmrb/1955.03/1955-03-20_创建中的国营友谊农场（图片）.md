The construction of the large-scale grain farm aided by the Soviet government – the "State-Run Friendship Farm" – is proceeding intensely. This large farm is located in Sandao Gang, Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province. Based on local soil, climate and other conditions, it will mainly cultivate grains such as wheat, soybeans, and corn, and gradually develop animal husbandry on the basis of developing grain production. In 1955, the main basic construction projects of the farm and the task of reclaiming 20,000 hectares of wasteland are to be completed. The construction and development of this large-scale grain farm will have a great demonstration effect in China's socialist transformation of agriculture.

This is a large number of tractors parked on the grassland, ready to be put into spring plowing production. All photos in this issue's pictorial are by our reporter Na Yi, except where noted.

　　Soviet experts and Chinese technicians, starting from November 17, 1954, completed the field survey and investigation of the State-Run Friendship Farm site after more than fifty days of intensive work in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius.

　　Soviet experts and Chinese technicians compile the survey data on the topography, soil, plant distribution, water conservancy, agriculture, and other aspects of the farm site into various charts as the basis for farm planning and design.

　　The general farm site of the State-Run Friendship Farm was determined on December 21, 1954, and a flag-raising ceremony was held. Now it is still a desolate prairie. Soon, new buildings will appear in the golden wheat waves.　Agricultural Film Studio Zhang Dajun Photo

　　Spring plowing is about to begin. This year, the State-Run Friendship Farm will sow more than 3,400 hectares of wheat, soybeans and other crops. Now all the seeds have been transported one after another. This is the situation of grain selection by the grain selection machine.

　　The basic construction of the State-Run Friendship Farm has received active support from workers of the state-run Hongxing, Erlongshan and other farms. These are workers collecting stones for construction.

　　Staff members transferred from all over the country to the State-Run Friendship Farm by the Ministry of Agriculture have arrived in batches. They are the vanguard in creating this huge mechanized farm.　Agricultural Film Studio Zhang Dajun Photo

　　The site of the State-Run Friendship Farm is very far from the capitals of China and the Soviet Union - Beijing and Moscow. However, the sounds broadcasted from the two capitals can be heard in the dormitories every day.

　　Rest is for better work. Soviet experts play chess in their dormitories.

    苏联政府帮助我国建立的大型谷物农场——“国营友谊农场”的建场工作正在紧张地进行。这个大型农场设在黑龙江省集贤县三道岗。根据当地土壤、气候等条件以种植小麦、大豆、苞米等谷物为主，并在发展谷物生产的基础上，逐步发展畜牧业。在一九五五年内要完成农场的主要基本建设工程和两万公顷荒地的开垦任务。这个大型谷物农场的兴建和发展，在我国农业的社会主义改造事业中，将有着很大的示范作用。

    苏联专家同我国技术人员从一九五四年十一月十七日开始在零下三十度的严寒中，经过五十多天的紧张劳动，胜利地完成了国营友谊农场场地的野外勘测、调查工作。这是苏联专家同我国技术人员正在视察场地。  农业电影社　张大钧摄

    春耕就要开始了，今年国营友谊农场将播种小麦、大豆等作物三千四百多公顷。现在全部种子已先后运到。这是谷物精选机正在选种的情形。
    国营友谊农场的基本建设工程，得到国营红星、二龙山等农场工人的积极支援。这是工人们正在采集建筑用的石头。
    农业部从全国各地调往国营友谊农场的工作人员，已分批到达。他们是创建这座巨大的机耕农场的先头部队。  农业电影社　张大钧摄
    国营友谊农场场地距离中苏两国的首都——北京和莫斯科都是非常遥远的。可是，每天都可以在宿舍里听到两国首都播出的声音。
