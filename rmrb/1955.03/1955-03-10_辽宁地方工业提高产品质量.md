Liaoning Local Industry Improves Product Quality

Many local state-owned factories and mines in Liaoning Province are actively learning from advanced Soviet experience, effectively increasing product output and quality. According to statistics from fourteen provincial state-owned factories and mines and nineteen municipal (county) state-owned factories and mines in Liaoning Province, each factory has generally studied thirty kinds of advanced Soviet experience in light of their actual conditions, achieving remarkable results in ensuring the completion of production plans. For example, the provincial state-owned pyrite mine failed to complete its production plan in the first half of last year, but since the mine learned the advanced Soviet experience of the "hollow cannon" and "multi-hole circulation channel" in September, it has overfulfilled its production plan for four consecutive months. The equipment efficiency of the bleaching workshop of the Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory was low, which often affected the production of the printed cloth workshop. Since the factory learned the advanced Soviet experience of the "Slutskaya cotton boiling and bleaching method," production efficiency has increased by 50 percent, with more than 1,000 extra pieces of white cloth bleached every day, and the cost of the cloth has also been reduced. Last year, the factory accumulated an additional profit of 121,300 yuan for the state. In addition, more than a dozen brick factories across the province have successively implemented the advanced Soviet experience of the "Gan Jialianke Kiln Method," which not only improved the output and quality of bricks, but also saved a large amount of industrial coal.

    辽宁地方工业提高产品质量
    辽宁省许多地方国营厂矿积极学习苏联先进经验，有效地提高了产品的产量和质量。据辽宁省十四个省营厂矿和十九个市（县）营厂矿的统计，各厂普遍结合实际情况学习了三十种苏联先进经验，在保证完成生产计划上取得了显著的成绩。如省营硫化铁矿去年上半年一直没有完成生产计划，但该矿自从在九月份学习了苏联的“空心炮”“多孔循环道”先进经验后，连续四个月都超额完成了生产计划。辽宁印染厂漂炼车间的设备效率低，经常影响花布车间的生产，自从该厂学习了“司路茨卡亚棉布煮漂法”苏联先进经验，生产效率提高了百分之五十，每天多漂出白布一千多匹，布的成本也降低了，去年一年给国家多积累了利润一十二万一千三百元。此外，全省十几个制砖厂先后推行了“岗查连科玛窑法”苏联先进经验，不仅提高了砖的产量和质量，同时也大量地节约了工业用煤。
