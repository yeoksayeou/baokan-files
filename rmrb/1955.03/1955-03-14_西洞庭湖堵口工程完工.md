The key project in the West Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province's lake management project – the closure project – was successfully completed on March 10th. With this, all twenty-four river mouths on the north bank of the Yuan River and the south bank of the Li River that enter West Dongting Lake have been completely closed. From now on, the Yuan River and the Li River will be separated, flowing into South and East Dongting Lake respectively along Nanju and Xiaoheju, without interfering with or backing up against each other in the West Dongting Lake area.

The closure project in the West Dongting Lake work area is mostly distributed on the floodways of the Yuan River and the Li River, including eight locations on the Yuan River floodway, eight locations on the Li River floodway, five locations on the Dongting Lake levee, and three locations in the Chongtian Lake area. The total length of the closure embankment is more than 4,000 meters, with more than 2 million cubic meters of earthwork (referring to the earthwork used for closure). It is the main difficult project in this phase of the Dongting Lake levee and embankment restoration project. Among the twenty-four closure locations, there is the Shangma River, a tributary of the Li River with a water depth of seven meters and a silt depth of more than three meters; and the Hanshou Xiaogang, with a water surface width of more than 400 meters and a water depth of more than twelve meters. These closure projects started successively from the end of November 1954 and were all successfully completed by the beginning of March 1955.

Currently, more than twenty new closure embankments have been built one to seven meters above the water surface, and some have been or are about to be completed. The new embankment of Hanshou Xiaogang will also be completed before the end of March. (Hu Qinghua)

    西洞庭湖堵口工程完工
    湖南省治湖工程中的西洞庭湖区重点工程——堵口工程，已在三月十日胜利合龙了。至此，沅水北岸和澧水南岸进入西洞庭湖的二十四个河口，已全部堵塞竣工。沅水和澧水从此分家，顺着南咀和小河咀，分别流入南、东洞庭湖，再不会在西洞庭湖区互相干扰、互相顶托了。
    西洞庭湖工区堵口工程，大部分分布在沅水和澧水洪道上，其中沅水洪道八处，澧水洪道八处，洞庭湖堤五处和冲天湖区三处。堵口堤线全长四千多公尺，土方二百多万实方（指堵口用的土方），是这期洞庭湖堤垸修复工程中的主要难工。二十四处堵口中有水深七公尺，淤深三公尺多的澧水支流上麻河；有水面宽达四百多公尺，水深十二公尺以上的汉寿小港，这些堵口工程自一九五四年十一月下旬起陆续动工，至一九五五年三月初全部胜利完成。
    目前，二十多处堵口新堤，已筑出水面一至七公尺，有的已经或即将完工，汉寿小港的新堤，也将于三月底前全部完工。　（胡清华）
