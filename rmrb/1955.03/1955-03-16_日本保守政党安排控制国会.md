Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: According to Tokyo newspapers, on the eve of the Diet session and the formation of the next cabinet, the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, two conservative parties, have reached an agreement to have members of each party hold the positions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the new House of Representatives, respectively. The two parties are also discussing the allocation of the chairmanships of the main committees of the House of Representatives behind the scenes. Sources reveal that this arrangement by the conservative parties to control the House of Representatives is to counteract the influence of the left-wing forces, which won more than one-third of the seats in the House of Representatives in the general election. The House of Representatives plays a decisive role in determining the Prime Minister and enacting various laws.
    Meanwhile, members of the Democratic and Liberal parties who are keen on merging have stepped up their activities to merge the conservative parties. On the 13th, Hitoshi Ashida, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, requested Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama to take steps to promote the merger of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party as soon as possible, so that the Democratic Party can smoothly promote its policies after continuing in power. As a step towards the merger, Ashida requested Ichiro Hatoyama to establish a research committee on foreign affairs including members of the Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and other people. Differences in foreign policy were the only policy differences between the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party during the general election.
    The combined strength of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives is second only to the Democratic Party. However, the continued division of the two parties facilitates the activities of the conservative parties to squeeze out the left-wing forces. Before and after the general election, the left and right wings of the Socialist Party have repeatedly expressed their intention to merge in principle, but no actual action has been taken so far.

    日本保守政党安排控制国会
    【新华社十五日讯】据东京报纸报道，在国会即将开会和产生下一届内阁的前夕，民主党和自由党两个保守政党已经取得协议，由两党分别占据新的众议院的议长和副议长职位。关于众议院各个主要委员会主席职位，两党也在幕后商量分配。消息透露，保守党派这种控制众议院的安排，是为了抵消在大选中取得了众议院三分之一以上议席的左派力量的影响。众议院在决定首相人选和制定各种法律方面居于决定性的地位。
    同时，民主党和自由党中热心于合并的分子已经加紧在进行保守党派合并的活动。民主党领袖之一芦田均在十三日要求首相鸠山一郎采取步骤早日促成民主党和自由党的合并，以使民主党在继续当政后能够顺利地推行自己的政策。作为导向合并的一个步骤，芦田均要求鸠山一郎设立一个包括民主党、自由党和其他人士在内的外交事务研究委员会。外交政策上的分歧是民主党和自由党在大选时的唯一政策分歧。
    左、右两派社会党在众议院的联合力量仅次于民主党。但是，两党的继续保持分裂状态便利了保守党派排挤左派力量的活动。大选前后，左、右两派社会党已曾一再在原则上表示要合并，然而迄今还没有采取实际行动。
