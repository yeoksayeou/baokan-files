(Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, March 15) This spring, Rehe Province, in rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives, has paid attention to relying on and giving play to the strength of the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas, further improving the ability of Party branches to manage cooperatives.

Before rectifying cooperatives, all counties in the province universally convened meetings of CCP village branch secretaries to study the Party's fundamental line and the principles and methods for rectifying cooperatives in the rural work during the transition period. After the end of the study, the CCP village branch secretaries returned to their villages, convened Party member meetings to relay what they learned, and inspected the implementation of the Party's line and policies in their villages. When the rectification of cooperatives began, county and district cadres also conducted pilot projects together with the village branches.

In leading the work of rectifying cooperatives, the CCP village branches first conscientiously examined the implementation of the Party's policies. Before the rectification, some Party members and cooperative members in the Wenjiagou Village Central Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Chaoyang County were unwilling to admit poor peasants into the cooperative and allowed some rich peasant elements to infiltrate; at the same time, the rental price of draught animals was too low, violating the principle of mutual benefit. In response to these situations, the CCP Wenjiagou Village Branch explained the importance of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants to the cooperative members. Many cooperative members examined their past erroneous ideas of excluding poor peasants. Subsequently, the cooperative admitted the poor peasants in the village, cleared out three rich peasant households who had infiltrated the cooperative, and appropriately increased the rental price of draught animals. After the rectification, the enthusiasm of the poor peasant members increased, and they actively put forward suggestions for improving production; Xu Enfeng, a middle peasant member who had previously wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, no longer wanted to withdraw.

In leading the work of rectifying cooperatives, the CCP village branches also paid attention to implementing the management policy of focusing on agricultural production. In the past, the Ershijiazi Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Chaoyang County had engaged in commerce every Spring Festival. During this rectification, the branch educated the cooperative members, guiding them to criticize the idea of neglecting agricultural production and engaging in commercial speculation. Now the cooperative members are at ease with agricultural production.

The CCP village branches also paid attention to educating the cooperative members to strengthen unity between cooperatives and to educate the cooperative members to lead mutual aid teams and individual farmers to increase production together. While leading the work of rectifying the cooperatives, the Xinglong Village Branch of the CCP in Beipiao County organized seven mutual aid teams. After the Xiaoliuzhangzi Village Branch of the CCP in Lingyuan County conducted education on united production throughout the village, it corrected the phenomenon in Meng Zhaofu Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, which looked down on Wang Jiuren Agricultural Producers' Cooperative because of its advanced production and excluded individual farmers. Under the education of the branch, the director of this cooperative took the initiative to help Wang Jiuren Agricultural Producers' Cooperative solve the difficulties in production.

Now, the CCP branches in many villages have improved their organizational structures and made political work for agricultural producers' cooperatives regular. In the cooperatives of various villages in the Eighth District of Beipiao County, Party groups have been formed wherever there are three Party members. The Xinglong Village Branch of the CCP in Kalaqin Left Banner has universally established propaganda groups in various agricultural producers' cooperatives in the village to organize cooperative members to carry out political and cultural studies.

    热河省在整顿农业生产合作社的工作中
    依靠党在农村中基层组织的力量
    【新华社承德十五日电】今年春天，热河省在整顿农业生产合作社中，注意依靠和发挥党在农村的基层组织的力量，使支部办社能力有了进一步的提高。
    全省各县在整顿合作社以前，普遍召开了中共村支部书记会议，学习党在过渡时期农村工作中的根本路线和整社的方针、办法等。中共各村支部书记在学习结束回村后，都召开了党员大会，进行传达并检查本村执行党的路线、政策的情况。在开始整顿合作社时，县区干部又和村支部一同进行了试点工作。
    中共各村支部在领导整顿合作社的工作中，首先认真检查党的政策贯彻的情形。朝阳县文家沟村中心农业生产合作社在整顿以前，社内有的党员和社员不愿吸收贫农入社，让一些富农分子混入了合作社；同时耕畜租价过低，违反了互利原则。中共文家沟村支部针对这些情况，向社员说明依靠贫农团结中农的重要性。许多社员检查了过去排挤贫农等错误思想。接着合作社吸收了村里的贫农入社，清除了混入合作社的三户富农，并把耕畜租价适当的提高。整顿后，贫农社员的积极性提高了，积极提出改进生产的意见；过去要退社的中农社员许恩峰，也不再退社了。
    中共各村支部在领导整顿合作社工作中，还注意贯彻以农业生产为主的经营方针。朝阳县二十家子村农业生产合作社，过去每逢春节都要经营商业。这次整顿中，支部对社员进行了教育，引导社员批判了忽视农业生产而进行商业投机的思想。现在社员们都安心农业生产了。
    中共各村支部还注意教育社员加强社和社之间的团结，教育社员带动互助组和个体农民共同增产。北票县中共兴隆村支部，在领导整顿合作社工作的同时，组织了七个互助组。凌源县中共小刘杖子村支部向全村进行团结生产的教育后，纠正了村里孟照富农业生产合作社因生产先进而看不起王九仁农业生产合作社、以及排斥个体农民的现象。这个社的主任在支部教育下，主动去帮助王九仁农业生产合作社解决生产中的困难。
    现在，许多村的中共支部健全了组织机构，并使对农业生产合作社的政治工作经常化。北票县八区各村的合作社中，凡是有三个党员的都组成了党的小组。喀喇沁左旗中共兴隆村支部在村内各农业生产合作社中普遍建立了宣传小组，组织社员进行政治和文化学习。
