    Several Questions Concerning the Military Service Law

    After the promulgation of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)," readers have sent in letters raising some questions. The replies are as follows:

    Question: Article 2 of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)" stipulates: "Male citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen... have the obligation to perform military service in accordance with the provisions of this Law." Last September, the order issued by the former Government Administration Council for recruiting and replenishing soldiers stipulated that recruitment should be conducted among male citizens aged eighteen to twenty-two. So, do all male citizens who have reached the age of eighteen have to serve in the active service? Or only male citizens aged eighteen to twenty-two?

    Answer: Article 15 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)" stipulates: "The period from March 1st of each year to the end of February of the following year shall be the recruitment year. Male citizens who reach the age of eighteen before June 30th of the recruitment year shall be conscripted into active service." That is to say, the starting age for active service is eighteen. In peacetime, the annual regular conscription mainly conscripts male citizens of this one age, eighteen. Specifically, those who should be conscripted into active service each year are mainly male citizens who reach the age of eighteen between July 1st of the previous year and June 30th of the current year. Let's take an example: if the conscription is carried out from November 1, 1957, to February 28, 1958, it is to conscript male citizens who reached the age of eighteen between July 1, 1956, and June 30, 1957. Their term of active service is calculated from March 1, 1958. Therefore, the oldest actual age of these people after enlisting is nineteen years and eight months, and the youngest is eighteen years and eight months. However, this does not mean that people over the age of eighteen cannot be conscripted into active service at all. According to Article 28 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)": "... Reserve soldiers who have not been conscripted into active service within the recruitment year and have been incorporated into the second category of the reserve force can still be conscripted into active service within five years from the time they are incorporated into the reserve force." This means that the state can, according to needs in peacetime, conduct conscription among male citizens of several ages.

    In September 1954, the order issued by the former Government Administration Council for recruiting and replenishing soldiers stipulated that recruitment should be conducted among male citizens aged eighteen to twenty-two. This is because this conscription to replenish soldiers was the beginning of the implementation of the compulsory military service system in our country, and the people were not yet accustomed to the implementation of the compulsory military service system. In order to gradually implement the compulsory military service system, this may still be done in the first few years of implementing the compulsory military service system.

    The above is the regulation for serving in active service in peacetime. In wartime, if imperialism launches a war of aggression against our country, the peacetime system will no longer be suitable. According to Article 52 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)," after the state issues a mobilization order, all reserve soldiers should prepare to enlist. This means that all reserve soldiers have the obligation to enlist and serve in active service in wartime. Article 10 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)" stipulates: "The term of reserve service for sergeants and soldiers shall be until the age of forty, after which they shall retire." This means that sergeants and soldiers who serve in the reserve force will no longer serve in the reserve force when they reach the age of forty, and therefore will no longer have the obligation to enlist and serve in active service.

    Question: Are conscripted citizens considered second-category reserve soldiers? Can military service organs manage them?

    Answer: According to the provisions of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)," conscripted citizens and reserve soldiers are two names with different meanings. What is a conscripted citizen? Article 16 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)" stipulates: "Male citizens who have reached the age of eighteen before June 30th of the recruitment year... who have passed military registration and preliminary physical examination are called conscripted citizens..." The second category of reserve force is produced from conscripted citizens during the annual regular conscription. During conscription, every conscripted citizen should report for conscription. After undergoing an enlistment physical examination and being determined by the local military service committee, those conscripted and enlisted into active service are called active-duty soldiers, and those conscripted citizens who are not conscripted and enlisted are incorporated into the second category of reserve force and called reserve soldiers.

    The military service organ can manage the conscripted citizens in terms of fulfilling their military service obligations. For example, when changing the conscription area of conscripted citizens, the conscripted citizens should consciously go through the transfer registration procedures in accordance with the regulations. At the same time, conscripted citizens are required to report for conscription at the date and place stipulated by the military service bureau during conscription. This means that conscripted citizens must consciously obey the management of the military service organ in these aspects.

    Question: Do staff members in state organs and enterprises also have the obligation to perform military service?

    Answer: According to Article 2 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)": "Male citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of their nationality, race, occupation, social origin, religious belief, or educational level, have the obligation to perform military service in accordance with the provisions of this Law." Staff members in state organs and enterprises, like other citizens, should actively enlist and serve in active service, fulfilling the sacred duty and glorious obligation of serving in the military to defend the motherland, as long as they are suitable for the conscription age. If some people are not conscripted into active service but serve in the reserve force, they should work and produce with peace of mind and prepare to participate in reserve force training.

    Question: When personnel serving in state organs and enterprises are conscripted into active service, can they be assigned to work that is of the same nature as their original occupation?

    Answer: When personnel serving in state organs and enterprises are conscripted into active service if they meet the prescribed conscription age and conditions, whether they are assigned to work that is the same as their original occupation depends on the needs of the army. Appropriate consideration can be given to their professional skills within the scope of the professional skills needed by the army. If there are no positions in the army that are the same as their original professional skills, or if the army needs them to assume other positions, they must obey the needs of the army.

    According to Article 33 of the "Military Service Law (Revised Draft)," if they are suitable for serving as officers and have been awarded reserve officer ranks and incorporated into the officer reserve, they can serve as officers when the state needs to conscript them into active service. The same is true for doctors. As long as they are suitable for serving as officers and are awarded reserve officer ranks and incorporated into the officer reserve, they can serve as military medical officers when the state needs to conscript them into active service.

    Question: Are personnel serving in state organs and enterprises paid during their military service? What benefits do their families receive?

    Answer: If personnel serving in state organs and enterprises meet the age and conditions for conscription into active service and are conscripted into active service, they will be provided for according to the supply standards in the army. If they are reserve officers who are called up for active service, they will be paid according to the salary standards in the army, and their original work units will no longer pay them. As for their families, they will be given preferential treatment in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations during the period when they are serving in active service. If they are not conscripted into active service but are incorporated into the reserve force, the issue of wages for processing military registration and participating in reserve force training has been clearly stipulated in Chapter 5 of the draft Military Service Law.

    有关兵役法的几个问题
    中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案）公布后，读者纷纷来信提出一些问题，现在答复如下：
    问：中华人民共和国兵役法
  （修正草案）第二条规定：“中华人民共和国年满十八岁的男性公民，……都有义务依照本法的规定服兵役。”去年九月，前政务院颁发的征集补充兵员的命令，规定在年满十八岁到二十二岁的男性公民中进行征集。那么，是年满十八岁以上的男性公民都要服现役？还是十八岁到二十二岁的男性公民才服现役？
    答：兵役法（修正草案）第十五条规定：“自每年三月一日起到下一年二月底止，为征集年度。在征集年度的六月三十日以前年满十八岁的男性公民，应当被征集服现役。”这就是说，现役的起征年龄是十八岁。在平时，每年的定期征集，主要是征集十八岁这一个年龄的男性公民。具体讲来，每年应征服现役的，主要是在上一年度七月一日到本年度六月三十日之间年满十八岁的男性公民。让我们举个例来说吧：在一九五七年十一月一日到一九五八年二月二十八日进行征集，就是要征集在一九五六年七月一日，到一九五七年六月三十日之间年满十八岁的男性公民。他们服现役的期限从一九五八年三月一日算起。所以这些人入伍后，最大的实足年龄是十九岁零八个月，最小的是十八岁零八个月。然而这并不是说完全不可以征集十八岁以上的人去服现役。根据兵役法（修正草案）第二十八条的规定：
  “……在征集年度内未被征集服现役而被编入第二类预备役的预备役军人，自编入预备役时起的五年内，仍可以被征集服现役。”这就是说，在平时国家可以根据需要，在几个年龄的男性公民中进行征集。
    一九五四年九月，前政务院发布的征集补充兵员的命令中，曾规定在十八到二十二岁这五个年龄的男性公民中进行征集。这是因为这次征集补充兵员是我国实行义务兵役制的开始，人民对实行义务兵役制还不习惯。为了逐步实行义务兵役制，在开始实行义务兵役制的几年内，可能还要这样做。
    以上说的是在平时服现役的规定。如果在战时，如果帝国主义对我国发动侵略战争，平时的制度就不适合了。根据兵役法（修正草案）第五十二条的规定，在国家发布动员令以后，所有的预备役军人都应当准备应征。这就是说，所有预备役军人，在战时都有应征服现役的义务。兵役法（修正草案）第十条规定：“军士和兵服预备役的期限到年满四十岁为止，期满后退役。”这就是说，服预备役的军士和兵年满四十岁时，就不服预备役了，所以也就没有应征服现役的义务了。
    问：应征公民是不是算第二类预备役军人？兵役机关是否可以管理他们？
    答：根据兵役法（修正草案）的规定，应征公民和预备役军人是两个不同意义的名称。什么叫应征公民呢？兵役法（修正草案）第十六条规定：
  “在征集年度的六月三十日以前年满十八岁的男性公民……经兵役登记和初步体格检查合格的，称应征公民……。”第二类预备役，是在每年定期征集的时候，由应征公民中产生的。在进行征集的时候，每一个应征公民都应报到应征，经过入伍体格检查和当地兵役委员会的确定，应征入伍服现役的称为现役军人，没有被征集入伍的应征公民就编入第二类预备役，称为预备役军人。
    兵役机关对于应征公民，在履行兵役义务的问题上是可以管理他们的。如要改变应征公民的征集区时，应征公民就要自觉地按照规定办理转移登记手续。同时也要求应征公民在征集时能够按照兵役局所规定的日期和地点报到应征。这就是说，应征公民在这些方面要自觉地服从兵役机关的管理。
    问：国家机关和企业中的工作人员，是否同样有服兵役的义务？
    答：根据兵役法（修正草案）第二条的规定：
  “中华人民共和国年满十八岁的男性公民，不分民族、种族、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰和教育程度，都有义务依照本法的规定服兵役。”国家机关和企业中的工作人员和其他公民一样，只要他们适合征集年龄，都应当积极应征服现役，履行服兵役保卫祖国的神圣职责和光荣义务。如果有些人未被征集服现役而服预备役，应该安心工作和生产，并准备参加预备役训练。
    问：在国家机关和企业中服务的人员应征服现役时，可否担任和他原职业性质相同的工作？
    答：在国家机关和企业中服务的人员，如果适合规定的应征年龄和条件而被征集入伍服现役时，是否担任与原职业相同的工作，这要根据军队的需要来确定。对于他们的专业技术，在军队所需要的专业技术范围内可予以适当照顾，如果军队中没有和他原职专业技术相同的职务或者军队中需要他担负别的职务时，就要服从军队的需要。
    按照兵役法（修正草案）第三十三条的规定，如果他们适合担任军官职务并已授予预备役军官军衔而编入军官预备役，在国家有必要征召他们入伍服现役时，就可以担任军官职务。医生也是这样，只要他们适合担任军官职务并授予预备役军官军衔而被编入军官预备役，在国家有必要征召他们入伍服现役时，就可以担任军医军官的职务。
  问：在国家机关和企业中服务的人员在服兵役期间，是不是发给工资？他们的家属有何待遇？
    答：在国家机关和企业中服务的人员，如果适合应征服现役年龄和条件而被征服现役时，就按照军队中供给标准供给，如果是预备役军官被征召服现役时，则按军队中的薪金标准发给，其原工作单位即不再发给工资。至于他们的家属，在他本人服现役期间，则根据优待条例予以优待。如果他们未被征集服现役而编入预备役，在办理兵役登记和参加预备役集训时的工资问题，兵役法草案第五章中已有明确规定。
