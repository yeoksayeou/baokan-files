    The Results of "Patronage Relief"
    By our reporter Gu Weijin
    In the autumn of 1954, Echeng County, Hubei Province, suffered a severe flood. In order to help the disaster victims carry out production for self-relief, the government successively distributed relief funds of 10.72 billion yuan (old currency, same below), flood diversion area output compensation of 18.58 billion yuan, housing repair subsidies of 9.6 billion yuan, and various loans (i.e., loans for cattle, farm tools, seeds, etc.) of 10.5 billion yuan from August 1954 to February 1955. In addition, the government provided disaster victims with a large number of reed mats, cotton clothing, etc., while ensuring the supply of grain and seeds. The people in the disaster area were very grateful for the government's care and assistance, and they all said: "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are our saviors." They actively organized themselves to rebuild their homes and launched a production self-relief campaign. Under the slogan of "Plant one inch as the water recedes," the county rushed to plant 560,000 mu of winter crops, exceeding the winter sowing area of 1953 by 7 percent. According to incomplete statistics, the sideline income of disaster victims in the county included: 7.8 million jin of firewood, 2 million jin of fish, 28,000 mu of vegetables, and significant income from other sideline occupations.
    Although production self-relief has achieved the above results, there are still serious problems.
    After the flood, the lives of the disaster victims were very difficult, and it was right for the government to provide strong support; however, the government's strong support was to promote production self-relief among the disaster victims. Some cadres, including some leading cadres, did not quite understand this principle. Seeing that the government was providing strong support to the disaster victims, they developed a wrong idea: "The government's support is of 'great magnitude,' so in order to ensure that no one starves to death, let's just 'patronize and relieve' the disaster victims." As a result, some district and township cadres, when distributing relief funds to the disaster victims, did not investigate the extent of the disaster, did not rely on mass democratic appraisal, and rarely conducted production self-relief education for the disaster victims. They simply provided relief to those who claimed to be in difficulty, and gave more relief to those who complained the loudest. As a result, some who should not have been given relief were given relief, and some who should have been given less relief were given more. The relief coverage in some townships reached 60 to 70 percent (according to the disaster situation in the county, the government stipulated that the relief coverage should not exceed 50 percent), and in some townships it reached more than 80 to 90 percent.
    What were the results of such relief? Some disaster victims, seeing that the relief funds came easily, used them for improper purposes. In Jinji, Yafan, Donggang, Hengshan, Tongshan, and other townships, some disaster victims spent the relief funds on eating and drinking well, making new clothes, etc., while some disaster victims spent the relief funds on gambling. There were also some township cadres who embezzled and misappropriated relief funds at will. The most serious thing was that it fostered the idea of simply relying on relief among some disaster victims. The masses in Tongshan Township mainly engaged in fishing as a sideline occupation, but 19 boats in the seventh district of this township were unwilling to go out fishing because they were afraid that they would not receive relief after fishing. Yun Weicheng, a poor peasant in Dawu Township, wanted his wife to participate in sideline occupations when he saw others doing so, but Yun Weicheng refused to let her go, saying: "It is better to be relieved by the government once or twice than to work to death." Some people, even if they engaged in production, focused on sideline occupations and did not pay attention to agriculture. They said: "Engaging in sideline occupations can provide immediate benefits; if agriculture is neglected, the government will provide relief in the future. Anyway, the government will not let anyone starve to death."
    The above facts show that the practice of "patronage relief" is completely wrong.
    After discovering this problem, the Echeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized the erroneous idea of cadres simply relying on the government to "patronize and relieve" the disaster victims at the county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings, and pointed out that it is necessary to carry out a production self-relief campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation. This approach is very good. However, how to carry out a production self-relief campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation? The County Committee spoke in more detail and specificity about rectifying mutual aid and cooperative organizations, but lacked specific and clear guidance on how to carry out production self-relief campaigns. As a result, the cadres' understanding of the spirit of the County Committee was: "Mutual aid and cooperation is the 'center'." As a result, some cadres simply rectified mutual aid and cooperative organizations, putting production self-relief work aside.
    Due to the lack of leadership in production self-relief work, the masses' idea of simply relying on government relief has still not been well corrected. At present, the county's production self-relief situation is not very good: the avenues for sideline production are very narrow. In addition to engaging in sideline production such as fishing, firewood gathering, and dike repair (repairing the Yangtze River dike, using work as relief), various diverse avenues for sideline production have not been opened up in accordance with local conditions. There is a surplus of labor in some areas, but they cannot find a way out. The agricultural production situation is even worse. Winter crops have not been well processed and cultivated, many wheat fields have not been top-dressed with fertilizer, the manure accumulation campaign has not been launched, many small-scale water conservancy projects have not started, and difficulties such as the lack of cattle and seeds have not been overcome. The Echeng County Committee and the County People's Government must quickly take effective measures to change this situation, otherwise it will make it more difficult to lead the disaster victims to overcome the spring famine and carry out the spring plowing production campaign.

    “包养救济”的结果
    本报记者　古维进
    一九五四年秋季，湖北省鄂城县遭受了严重的水灾。政府为了扶持灾民进行生产自救，从一九五四年八月至一九五五年二月止，先后发放救济款一百零七亿二千万元（旧币、下同），分洪区产量补偿款一百八十五亿八千万元，修理房屋补助费九十六亿元及各种贷款（即耕牛、农具、种子等贷款）一百零五亿元。另外政府给灾民救济大批芦席、棉衣等，同时保证粮食、种子等供应。灾区人民对政府的关怀和扶助非常感激，都说：“毛主席共产党是再生恩人。”他们积极组织起来，重建家园，开展生产自救运动。全县在“水退一寸种一寸”的口号下，抢种冬播作物五十六万亩，超过一九五三年的冬播面积百分之七。据不完全统计，全县灾民的副业收入有：砍柴七百八十万斤，打鱼二百万斤，种菜二万八千亩，其他副业的收入也很大。
    生产自救虽然取得了以上的成绩，但是却还存在着严重问题。
    水灾后，灾民的生活很困难，政府要大力扶持是对的；但是政府的大力扶持是为了推动灾民进行生产自救。有些干部包括部分领导干部在内却不大懂得这个道理。他们看见政府对灾民进行大力扶持，就产生了一种错误的想法：“政府扶持的‘气魄大’，为了保证不饿死人，就把灾民‘包养救济’起来吧。”于是有些区、乡干部给灾民发放救济款时，不去摸清灾情底子，不去依靠群众民主评议，也很少对灾民进行生产自救教育，只是看见灾民喊困难就救济，谁喊得凶就多救济一些。结果，不该救济的救济了，该少救济的多救济了。有些乡的救济面达百分之六、七十（根据该县灾情，政府规定救济面不超过百分之五十），有的乡救济面达百分之八、九十以上。
    这样的救济造成了什么结果呢？有些灾民看见救济款来得容易，就把救济款用在不正当的地方。金鸡、鸭畈、东港、横山、桐山等乡，有的灾民领到救济款就去吃好喝好的，做新衣服等，有的灾民领到救济款就去赌博，还有些乡干部随便挪用、贪污救济款。最严重的是养成了有些灾民的单纯依赖救济的思想。桐山乡群众是以打鱼为主要副业生产，但这个乡七选区有十九只船上的人不愿出去打鱼，他们害怕打鱼后，得不到救济。大悟乡贫农运维成的妻子看见旁人搞副业，想去参加，运维成不让去，说：“累死还不如政府救济一、二次。”有些人即使去搞生产，也偏重搞副业，不重视农业。他们说：“搞副业可以吃现的，误了农业，将来政府会救济，反正政府不会饿死人的。”
    以上事实说明，“包养救济”的做法是完全错误的。
    中共鄂城县委发现这个问题后，在县、区、乡三级干部会议上，曾批判干部单纯依靠政府把灾民
  “包养救济”起来的错误思想，指出必须以互助合作为中心开展生产自救运动。这个做法是很好的。但是怎样以互助合作为中心开展生产自救运动呢？县委对整顿互助合作组织说得比较详细具体，对如何开展生产自救运动却缺乏具体明确的指导。于是，干部领会县委的精神是：“互助合作是‘中心’”。结果，有些干部就单纯去整顿互助合作组织，把生产自救工作放在一边。
    由于生产自救工作缺乏领导，群众单纯依靠政府救济的思想仍然没有很好纠正过来。目前全县的生产自救情况是不大好的：副业生产的门路很窄。各地除了进行打鱼、砍柴、修堤（修长江堤，以工代赈）等副业生产外，没有因地制宜地开辟多种多样的副业生产门路。有些地区劳力有剩余，找不到出路。农业生产的情况更差。冬播作物没有很好加工培育，许多小麦田都没有上追肥，积肥运动没有开展起来，许多小型水利工程没有动工，缺乏耕牛、种子等困难还没有克服。鄂城县委会和县人民政府要迅速采取有效措施改变这种情况，否则就会给领导灾民渡过春荒，开展春耕生产运动，增加许多困难。
