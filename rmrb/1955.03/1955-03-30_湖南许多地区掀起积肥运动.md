In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient commercial fertilizer, farmers in many areas of Hunan Province are working hard to find fertilizer sources. More than 190,000 farmers in Pingjiang County participated in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, looking for fertilizer sources everywhere, and found many soil fertilizers that were not used much in the past. For example: digging wild manure, digging mud from toilets and old houses, accumulating garbage and ashes, digging mud from harbors, ditches, and gardens, and cleaning pig pens, cattle sheds, chicken coops, and sewers. They accumulated more than 5 million dan of soil fertilizer in a very short period of time. Farmers who previously thought there were no fertilizer sources saw this fact and worked hard to accumulate fertilizer. Shuangfeng County launched a ten-day fertilizer accumulation campaign from March 13th, preparing to accumulate 10 million dan of fertilizer to ensure that each mu of land in the county has 55 dan of fertilizer.

By paying attention to the use of local fertilizer, many agricultural production cooperatives have relied on everyone's fertilizer accumulation to overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds within the cooperative. Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the first district of Pingjiang County mobilized its members to use their brains and accumulate more soil fertilizer to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds for more than 500 yuan of commercial fertilizer. Jinpen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaoshan Township, the second district of Changsha County, originally lacked fertilizer for 21 mu of land; later, it mobilized everyone to find fertilizer sources and finally solved the problem. Majiachong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingling County expanded the cooperative and had more than 100 mu of land than in 1954; however, because of the use of local fertilizer, the investment in commercial fertilizer was reduced by 150 yuan compared with last year. The members said: "Accumulating more soil fertilizer can increase production and income." Some agricultural production cooperatives also drove mutual aid teams and individual farmers to work hard to accumulate fertilizer. Individual farmers in Guihua Township, the sixth district of Wangcheng County, who lacked fertilizer, were encouraged and helped by the agricultural production cooperative and accumulated enough fertilizer.

    湖南许多地区掀起积肥运动
    湖南省许多地区农民为着解决商品肥料不足的困难，努力寻找肥源。平江县十九万多农民参加了积肥运动，到处找肥源，找到许多过去不大利用的土肥。例如：挖野粪，挖厕所和老屋的泥，积垃圾和草木灰，挖港泥、沟泥和园土，清猪棚、牛棚、鸡舍和阴沟。他们在很短时间内就积了五百多万担土肥。过去认为没有什么肥源的农民，看到这个事实，也都努力积肥了。双峰县从三月十三日起，展开旬日积肥运动，准备积起一千万担肥，保证全县每亩田都有五十五担肥。
    由于注意利用土肥，许多农业生产合作社依靠大家积肥，克服了社内资金不足的困难。平江县一区新民农业生产合作社发动社员开动脑筋，多积土肥解决了五百多元商品肥料资金不够的困难。长沙县二区高山乡金盆农业生产合作社原来缺少二十一亩田的肥；后来动员大家找肥源，终于解决了这个问题。零陵县马家冲农业生产合作社扩大了社，比一九五四年多了一百多亩田；但因为利用土肥，却比去年减少了一百五十元商品肥料的投资。社员们说：“多积土肥，能增产，又能增加收入。”有些农业生产合作社还带动互助组和个体农民，努力积肥。望城县六区桂花乡缺肥的个体农民，因为得到农业生产合作社的鼓舞和帮助，也都积够了肥。（本报驻长沙记者）
