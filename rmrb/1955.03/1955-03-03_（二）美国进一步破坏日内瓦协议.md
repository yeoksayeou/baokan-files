(II) The United States Further Sabotages the Geneva Accords

No sooner had the Bangkok Conference ended than Dulles ran to Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam to carry out further activities to undermine the Geneva Accords.

According to a Reuters report from Vientiane on February 28th, during Dulles' visit to Vientiane, the capital of Laos, he forced Laos to negotiate and conclude a military "aid" treaty with the United States. The Lao Prime Minister's own remarks confirmed this fact.

At the same time, due to Dulles' pressure, the Royal Lao Government issued a communique stating that the provisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty had included Laos. The communique also expressed "satisfaction" with the Bangkok Conference's violation of the Geneva Accords and its attempt to formally pull Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive alliance.

These activities orchestrated and directed by Dulles fundamentally violated the final declaration of the Geneva Conference and the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos."

The Geneva Declaration stipulates that Cambodia and Laos shall not conclude military agreements with other countries. Now, immediately after the Bangkok Conference, Dulles has exerted pressure to negotiate a military "aid" treaty with Laos. The Geneva Declaration also stipulates that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos shall not participate in any military alliances, but Dulles wants Laos to acknowledge in a government communique that the provisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty include Laos, further pulling Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia military alliance. It is well known that Chapter II of the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos" stipulates: "The introduction into Laos of new troops, military personnel, new weapons, and ammunition is prohibited." Article 6 of this chapter further stipulates: "From the time of the ceasefire, the introduction into Laos of any reinforcements of troops or military personnel from outside Laos is prohibited." However, Dulles openly violated these provisions by seeking to negotiate a military "aid" treaty with Laos. Judging from the so-called military aid treaties that the United States has signed with other countries, it is conceivable that the negotiation and signing of such a treaty would involve the United States sending military personnel and shipping in large quantities of military supplies, turning Laos into a US military base. This is to facilitate the expansion of aggression and preparation for war by the United States in Asia, endangering peace and security in Asia.

According to reports from the United States Information Service and American news agencies, Dulles' current activities to undermine the Geneva Accords are not limited to this. During his time in Vientiane and Phnom Penh, he also plotted plans for the United States to train and expand the armies of Laos and Cambodia. A cable from the United States Information Service revealed: "Dulles emphasized that the United States, by participating with equipment and money, will require that this equipment and money be used in ways deemed appropriate by American military advisors." In other words, it would be used in ways that meet the needs of US aggression.

At the same time, Dulles engaged in another conspiracy: the United States will train Lao troops in Thailand. The Lao Minister of Defense announced that Laos accepted this plan, which violates the Geneva Accords. Agence France-Presse said that "French figures in Saigon" also believe that "this is difficult to reconcile with the Geneva Accords."

At the Geneva Conference, the United States government stated that "the United States will not use threats or force to undermine these agreements and provisions." Dulles' aforementioned activities not only violate these agreements and provisions but also violate the US government's own statement.

These sinful actions of the United States in undermining the Geneva Accords and preparing for war are unacceptable and extremely detrimental to the people of Indochina. Clearly, wherever US military control reaches, that place will first be turned into a US colony and military base according to US plans. Under these circumstances, Laos' negotiation and signing of the so-called military aid treaty allowing Laos to be drawn into the Southeast Asia military alliance will certainly not benefit Laos and the Lao people in any way. The Chinese people firmly oppose this action by the United States to further undermine the Geneva Accords and believe that all other countries participating in the Geneva Accords have a responsibility to stop the development of this dangerous trend.

### （二）美国进一步破坏日内瓦协议

    （二）美国进一步破坏日内瓦协议
    曼谷会议一结束，杜勒斯就跑到老挝、柬埔寨和南越去进行进一步破坏日内瓦协议的活动。
    根据路透社万象二月二十八日消息，在杜勒斯访问老挝首都万象的时候，他迫使老挝同美国谈判订立军事“援助”条约。老挝首相自己的谈话证实了这个事实。
    同时，由于杜勒斯的压力，老挝王国政府发表公报，表示东南亚条约的条款已把老挝包括在内。公报并且对曼谷会议违反日内瓦协议，企图把老挝正式拉进东南亚侵略同盟的活动表示“满意”。
    杜勒斯所策动和指使的这些活动，根本违反了日内瓦会议的最后宣言和“老挝停止敌对行动协定”。
    日内瓦宣言规定柬埔寨、老挝两国不与其他国家缔结军事协定。现在，紧接着曼谷会议之后，杜勒斯就施用压力，要同老挝谈判军事“援助”条约。日内瓦宣言又规定越南、柬埔寨、老挝不得参加任何军事同盟，而杜勒斯竟要老挝以政府公报形式承认东南亚条约的条款包括老挝在内，把老挝进一步拉向侵略性的东南亚军事同盟。人所共知，“老挝停止敌对行动协定”第二章规定：“禁止运入新的部队，军事人员，新的武器和弹药”。这一章的第六条并进一步规定：“自宣布停火之时起，禁止从老挝境外运入一切增援性部队和军事人员。”可是，杜勒斯却公然违反这些规定，要同老挝谈判军事“援助”条约。从美国同别的国家签订的所谓军援条约看，可以想见，谈判和签订这种条约就是要由美国派遣军事人员、运入大量军火物资，来把老挝变成美国的军事基地。以便于美国在亚洲扩大侵略、准备战争，危害亚洲的和平和安全。
    根据美国新闻处和美国通讯社的消息，杜勒斯目前破坏日内瓦协议的活动还不止此。他在万象和金边时，还策划了美国训练和扩充老挝和柬埔寨军队的计划。美国新闻处的一条电讯透露：“杜勒斯强调说，美国以装备和金钱参加进来，将要求把这些装备和金钱用在美国军事顾问认为适当的方面”。换句话说，就是用在符合于美国侵略需要的方面。
    同时，杜勒斯还搞了另一个阴谋，美国将在泰国训练老挝军队。老挝国防大臣宣布，老挝接受了这个违反日内瓦协定的计划。法新社说，“西贡的法国人士”也认为“这同日内瓦协定是很难协调的”。
    美国政府在日内瓦会议上曾经声明“美国将不使用威胁和武力去妨害这些协定和条款”。杜勒斯的上述活动不仅违反了这些协定和条款，而且也违背了美国政府自己的声明。
    美国这种种破坏日内瓦协议、准备战争的罪恶行动，是不能容许的，对印度支那人民是非常不利的。显然，美国的军事控制到什么地方，那个地方就要按照美国的计划，首先变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。在这种情形之下，老挝同美国谈判和签订所谓军事援助条约容许老挝被拉进东南亚军事同盟，对老挝和老挝人民当然决不会有任何好处。中国人民坚决反对美国这个进一步破坏日内瓦协议的行动，同时认为所有参加日内瓦协议的其他国家都有责任制止这一危险趋势的发展。
