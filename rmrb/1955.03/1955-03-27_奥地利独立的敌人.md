   The Enemies of Austrian Independence
   Jiang Yuanchun

    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 24th regarding the Austrian State Treaty, stating that because the Austrian government welcomes effective safeguards and guarantees against the danger of German-Austrian annexation, and does not intend to join military alliances, nor does it intend to allow the establishment of military bases on its territory, the Soviet government agrees to discuss the Austrian State Treaty separately at a conference of the four powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, with Austria participating.

    At a time when the prospect of the revival of West German militarism seriously threatens the security of Austria and brings the danger of German-Austrian annexation, the Soviet government's action is in line with the interests of maintaining and consolidating European peace, and also in line with the interests of the Austrian people who demand democracy and independence.

    The reason why the Austrian State Treaty has not been resolved for so long is mainly because the United States and its followers, disregarding the interests of peace and independence of the Austrian people, oppose the inclusion in the Austrian State Treaty of clauses prohibiting the conclusion of military alliances or the establishment of foreign military bases. Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, using it as a strategic base for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Southeast Europe, and the Balkans. Now the United States is following in Hitler's footsteps, attempting to realize the German-Austrian annexation and turn Austria into a military base for the United States to prepare for an attack on the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe.

    Precisely because of this, the United States and its followers are extremely uneasy about the recent contacts between the Soviet Union and Austria regarding the Austrian State Treaty, and are trying to obstruct the resolution of this issue. A British Foreign Office spokesman came out on March 12th, posing as a protector of Austrian independence, saying, "Prohibiting Austria from joining certain alliances or agreeing to the establishment of foreign bases on its territory after the signing of the Austrian State Treaty is contrary to Austrian independence."

    The British Foreign Office spokesman's argument was learned from Dulles. Dulles said at the Berlin Conference in 1954 that he believed the Austrian government had the right to freely invite "foreign troops as allies," which was the foundation of Austrian independence.

    The United States and its followers are trying to make people believe that Austria concluding a military alliance with West German militarists, or "inviting" West German troops to Austria, is the foundation of Austrian independence.

    However, history has precisely overturned this absurd argument. In 1936, in order to annex Austria, Hitler sent Papen to negotiate with Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg to conclude the German-Austrian Agreement. Before this, Schuschnigg emphasized that the primary condition for German-Austrian friendship was Austrian independence. At that time, Papen readily promised, "That is a natural thing." Hitler used the German-Austrian Agreement to develop fascist forces in Austria. In 1938, the fascist Seyss-Inquart forced Schuschnigg to resign and "invited" Hitler's troops into Austria. Austria's independence came to an end.

    Now, the United States is trying its best to arm West Germany, attempting to create a situation of a strong neighbor pressing down on Austria, to force Austria to accept the German-Austrian annexation and allow foreign countries to establish military bases. It says this is Austria's so-called "independence." May I ask, what is the essential difference between this and Hitler's approach to Austria? The United States's aim is clearly to repeat the tragedy of Austria's annexation by Hitler's Germany in 1938, causing Austria to lose its independence. Adenauer is well aware of the intentions of his American masters. In the "Soldiers' Almanac" issued by German revanchists in West Germany, Austria has been openly referred to as an "administrative region" rather than an independent country.

    The deceptiveness of the American and British arguments about Austria's so-called "independence" is particularly evident in the pressure the United States is exerting on Austria. When the Associated Press reported on the 24th the news that the Soviet Union had invited Austrian Prime Minister Raab to Moscow to discuss the Austrian State Treaty, it quoted so-called "well-informed observers" as saying that any understanding reached between Austria and the Soviet Union would not be binding on other countries.

    This is actually an attempt to influence Raab and prevent him from going to Moscow. Because if the understanding reached between the Soviet Union and Austria is incompatible with the German-Austrian annexation and the establishment of foreign military bases in Austria advocated by the United States, the United States will never allow the Austrian government to resolve the Austrian State Treaty issue in accordance with Austria's national interests. Only after the United States's plans are realized will the United States give Austria so-called "independence." This is actually an attempt to obstruct the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty and threaten European peace.

    The American attitude has nothing in common with respecting Austria's sovereign independence after the treaty is signed. No matter how hard the United States tries to portray itself as a "protector" of Austrian independence, in reality, it is an enemy of Austria achieving true independence.

   奥地利独立的敌人
   蒋元椿
    苏联外交部在二十四日就对奥和约问题发表声明，表示由于奥地利政府欢迎防止德奥合并的危险的有效保障和保证，并且不打算参加军事联盟，也不打算允许在它的领土上建立军事基地，因此苏联政府同意在苏、美、英、法四国和有奥地利参加的会议上单独讨论对奥和约问题。
    在西德军国主义复活的前景严重地威胁着奥地利的安全并且带来德奥合并的危险的时候，苏联政府的这一行动符合于维持和巩固欧洲和平的利益，也符合于要求民主和独立的奥地利人民的利益。
    对奥和约问题之所以迟迟没有能够解决，主要是由于美国和它的追随者不顾奥地利人民的和平和独立的利益，反对在对奥和约中包括禁止缔结军事联盟或建立外国军事基地的条款。希特勒在一九三八年并吞奥地利，将它作为侵略捷克斯洛伐克、东南欧和巴尔干的战略根据地。现在美国也步希特勒的后尘，企图实现德奥合并，将奥地利变成美国准备进攻苏联和东欧人民民主国家的军事基地。
    正因为如此，美国和它的追随者们对于苏联和奥地利之间最近就对奥和约问题所进行的接触极为不安，竭力企图阻挠这个问题的解决。英国外交部发言人在三月十二日以奥地利独立的保护人的姿态出来说，“在签订对奥和约以后不准奥地利参加某些联盟或答应在它领土上建立外国基地，那是同奥地利的独立背道而驰的。”
    英国外交部发言人这种论调是从杜勒斯那里学来的。杜勒斯一九五四年在柏林会议上就说过，他认为奥地利政府有权自由邀请“作为同盟者的外国军队”，是奥地利独立的基础。
    美国和它的追随者企图使人相信，奥地利和西德军国主义者缔结军事联盟，或者把西德军队“邀请”到奥地利去，就是奥地利独立的基础。
    但是，历史恰恰推翻了这种荒谬的论调。一九三六年，希特勒为了并吞奥地利，派巴本同奥地利首相舒斯尼格谈判缔结德奥协定。在这以前，舒斯尼格强调德奥亲善的首要条件是奥地利的独立。当时巴本满口答应说，“那是自然的事。”希特勒利用德奥协定在奥地利发展了法西斯力量。一九三八年，法西斯分子赛斯·殷奎特迫使舒斯尼格辞职，把希特勒军队“邀请”进了奥地利。奥地利的独立就此告终。
    现在，美国竭力武装西德，企图对奥地利造成强邻压境的态势，来逼迫奥地利接受德奥合并，并容许外国建立军事基地。它说这就是奥地利的所谓“独立”。请问这同希特勒对付奥地利的一套有何实质上的不同？美国的目的显然是要重演一九三八年奥地利被希特勒德国并吞的悲剧，使奥地利丧失独立。阿登纳是十分了解他的美国主子的意图的。德国复仇主义者在西德发行的“军人历书”中，已经把奥地利公然称作一个“行政区”而不是一个独立的国家了。
    美国和英国关于奥地利的所谓“独立”的论调的欺骗性，特别明显地表现在美国对奥地利所施加的压力上。美联社二十四日在报道苏联邀请奥地利总理拉布去莫斯科讨论对奥和约问题的消息时，引所谓“消息灵通的观察家”的话说，奥地利和苏联之间达成的任何谅解，绝不会对其他国家有约束力。
    这实际上就是想影响拉布不让他去莫斯科。因为如果苏奥两国达成的谅解同美国所主张的德奥合并和在奥地利建立外国军事基地不相容的话，美国决不容许奥地利政府按照奥地利的民族利益来解决对奥和约问题。只有在美国的打算实现以后，美国才肯给奥地利所谓“独立”。这实际上也就是想阻挠缔结对奥和约，威胁欧洲和平。
    美国这种态度和尊重签订和约以后的奥地利的主权独立毫无共同之处。无论美国怎样竭力想把自己装扮成是奥地利独立的“保护人”，但是，实际上，它却是奥地利取得真正独立的敌人。
