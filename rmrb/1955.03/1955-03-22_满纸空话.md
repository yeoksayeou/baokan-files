Full of Empty Talk
    Long Zixun
    In 1954, the Beijing Company of China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation signed two supply contracts with the Dalian Steel Plant. The Dalian Steel Plant failed to deliver on time for both contracts. So, on November 30th of last year, the company sent a notice to the Dalian Steel Plant, demanding strict enforcement of the contract and payment of late penalties. On February 24th of this year, the Dalian Steel Plant sent a solemn official document. Logically, it should have addressed the issues raised by the Beijing Company of China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation, right? However, the situation was completely different.
    The official document began by stating: "In the second year of large-scale economic construction – the year 1954 – our country has completed the progress plan of the Five-Year Plan. This is something we are all very happy about. Your factory and our factory are both combat units striving to realize socialist economic construction, with a common goal: to fulfill the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the People's Government. You and we are close comrades-in-arms active on the economic front. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our country has obtained the help of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, as well as the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, and achieved a great victory in 1954. To congratulate this common victory of you, us, and the people of the whole country, we extend our congratulations to your factory."
    It then continued: "In 1954, our factory received the care and support of your factory and other fraternal factories and mines, and basically completed the tasks assigned to us by the state. We have made certain improvements in production technology management and business management. However, the achievement of these results is inseparable from the opinions and assistance provided by fraternal factories and mines, and we would like to express our gratitude to you for this!"
    The third paragraph reviewed "the factory's leadership's ideological awareness of socialism is not high, and the concept of serving users is not strong," etc., and finally "extends its apologies." The fourth paragraph stated that "a thorough inspection and analysis has been made of the above-mentioned situations," and "we truly feel that our work style must be improved, otherwise it will hinder the early arrival of our beautiful socialist society, so we deeply feel the heavy responsibility," and therefore "regarding all uncompleted procedures and unresolved refusals of payment and returns from past years, we hope for strong assistance in handling them, and hope that in the future, in supply and demand relationships, we can further deepen ties and continuously offer criticisms and give opinions for improvement," and "we eagerly await this and extend our respects."
    After reading this official document, who can understand what it is actually saying? It neither answers the demands of the Beijing Company of China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation, nor puts forward specific opinions on how to handle these problems, and even less can it let people know in which areas future work needs "assistance." This kind of official document, full of empty talk and evasive excuses, is caused by an irresponsible, bureaucratic work style. It cannot solve practical problems, but only wastes paper, ink, and the energy of cadres.
    We must eliminate this style of replacing practical work with empty talk from our organs and enterprises.

    满纸空话
    龙子勋
    中国五金机械公司北京市公司一九五四年曾同大连钢厂订了两次供应合同，大连钢厂都没有按期交货，公司就在去年十一月三十日给大连钢厂去了一份通知单，要求严格执行合同规定，偿付误期罚款。到了今年二月二十四日，大连钢厂来了一封慎重其事的公文。照理说来，它应该解决中国五金机械公司北京市公司提出的问题了吧！可是，情况却完全不是这样的。
    这件公文一开始写道：“在大规模经济建设的第二年——一九五四年度，我们的国家，已完成了五年计划的进度计划，这是我们大家感到很高兴的事情。贵厂和我厂都是在为实现社会主义经济建设而奋斗的作战单位，目标是共同的，都是在实现着党和人民政府交给我们的任务，你们和我们都是在经济战线上活动的亲密战友。我们的国家在毛主席的英明领导下，获得了苏联及以苏联为首的人民民主阵营的帮助以及全国人民的热烈支持，在一九五四年获得了伟大胜利，为了祝贺这个你们和我们以及全国人民的共同胜利，特向您厂致贺。”
    接着写道：“我厂在一九五四年得到您厂及各兄弟厂矿的照顾和支持，基本上完成了国家给我们的任务；在生产技术管理上及经营管理上有了某些提高和改进。但是这些成绩的取得是与各兄弟厂矿对我们提供的意见和帮助是分不开的，为此特向您们致以谢意！”
    第三段是检讨“厂的领导思想上，社会主义的觉悟程度不高，为用户服务的观念不够强”等等，最后是“致以歉意”。第四段声明“对上述种种情况，已作了一次彻底的检查和分析”，“确实感到我们的工作作风必须求得改进，不然是会阻碍我们美好的社会主义社会早日到来，故深感责任重大”，因而“对过往年度一切应了未了手续及悬而未决的拒付和退货，尚请大力协助处理，并希今后在供需关系上更臻密切不断地提出批评和赐予改进意见”，并“不胜盼切，谨致敬礼”。
    人们读了这件公文以后，谁能懂得它究竟是说的一些什么呢？它既没有答复中国五金机械公司北京市公司的要求，也没有提出处理这些问题的具体意见，更不能使人知道今后工作在那些方面需要“协助”。这种满纸空话、推托敷衍的公文，是不负责任的官僚主义作风所造成的。它不能解决实际问题，只能浪费纸张笔墨和干部的精力而已。
    必须把这种以空话代替实际工作的作风从我们的机关和企业中清除出去。
