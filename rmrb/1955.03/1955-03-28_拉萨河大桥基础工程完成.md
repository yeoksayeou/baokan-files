Lhasa River Bridge Foundation Project Completed
    The foundation project for the Lhasa River Bridge, the longest bridge on the Kangzang Highway, was fully completed on the 22nd.

    For more than three months, bridge workers braved the bitter cold to work in the water and dug foundation pits amidst the strong winds of the river valley. Under the slogan of "Building the Lhasa River Bridge quickly and well," the pile driving project was successfully completed. Workers launched a labor competition at the beginning of February, and the progress of various types of work increased by 20% to 100%. In order to build the bridge before the upstream ice melts and the water rises, workers have been working overtime in the past ten days. Now, a large number of bridge deck materials such as steel and wood have been continuously transported to the site, and the workers are installing the bridge deck and railings. Some technicians and workers from the bridge engineering team are also organizing machinery and tools, preparing to meet new tasks. In recent days, Lhasa citizens have been coming to the bridge construction site more frequently. Some touch the newly driven bridge piles, while others hang Hada scarves and scripture flags on the bridge railings that cross the water.

    拉萨河大桥基础工程完成
    康藏公路全线最长的拉萨河大桥基础工程二十二日全部完成。
    三个多月来，架桥工人冒着严寒下水，在河谷大风中，挖掘基坑。在“把拉萨河大桥架得又快又好”的口号下，顺利完成了基桩入土工程。工人们从二月初展开了劳动竞赛，各工种工程的进展提高百分之二十到一倍。为了在上游冰消水涨前架好大桥，最近十天来，工人们曾加班工作。现在大批钢铁、木料等桥面材料已源源运到，工人们正在安装桥面和护栏。桥梁工程队的部分技术人员和工人也正整理机械和工具，准备迎接新任务。这几天拉萨市民更频繁地来到大桥工地，有的摸摸刚打好的桥桩，有的把哈达和经旗挂在跨水部分的桥栏上。
