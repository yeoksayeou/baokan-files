Primary education in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province, is gradually being nationalized. Since the spring of 1954, primary schools in Jinghong and Mengzhe areas of Xishuangbanna have successively established Dai language classes. In February 1954, the Sixth Primary School of Xishuangbanna translated the first volume of primary school textbooks into Dai language and conducted teaching experiments. The progress was about three times faster than teaching in Chinese. The Autonomous Region People's Government decided to widely promote this method. Local cultural and educational departments have held short-term Dai language training classes. More than half of the teachers in the region can now teach in Dai language after simple preparation. The Autonomous Region People's Government decided to translate the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of primary school textbooks into Dai language. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    西双版纳傣族自治区小学教育逐步民族化
    云南西双版纳傣族自治区小学教育逐步民族化。从一九五四年春天起，版纳景洪、版纳勐遮等地区的小学校先后设立了傣文班。西双版纳第六小学一九五四年二月用傣文译出小学课本第一册，进行了教学试验，进度要比汉语教学快三倍左右。自治区人民政府决定普遍推行这种方法。当地文教部门举办了短期傣文训练班，全区现在已有半数以上教师经过简单的备课，就能够用傣语讲课。自治区人民政府决定把小学课本一、二、三、四册译成傣文。                     （据新华社讯）
