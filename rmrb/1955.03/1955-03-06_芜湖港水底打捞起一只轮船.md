    A ship, the "Dehe," which had been submerged at the bottom of Wuhu Port for nearly eighteen years, has been salvaged.
    The "Dehe" was a large steamer that sailed on the Yangtze River before the War of Resistance Against Japan, with a capacity of 1,000 passengers and about 2,000 tons of cargo. It was bombed and sunk by Japanese aircraft in Wuhu Port in July 1937.
    The salvage work on this ship began at the end of November 1954. During the salvage operation, all the salvage workers and divers overcame the difficulties of severe cold and deep-water operations, cleared more than 9,000 tons of silt accumulated inside the ship, and created some instruments needed for technical equipment, ensuring the smooth progress of the salvage work.

    芜湖港水底打捞起一只轮船
    沉没在芜湖港水底近十八年的德和号轮船，已经打捞出水。
    德和号轮船是抗日战争前航行在长江上的一只大轮船，可容乘客一千人，装货约两千吨。一九三七年七月间，在芜湖港被日寇飞机轰炸沉没。
    这只轮船的打捞工作，从一九五四年十一月底开始。打捞期间，全体打捞工人和潜水人员克服了严寒和深水操作的困难，清除了船内淤积的九千多吨泥沙，并创造了一些技术设备上所需要的仪器，保证了打捞工作的顺利进行。（新华社）
