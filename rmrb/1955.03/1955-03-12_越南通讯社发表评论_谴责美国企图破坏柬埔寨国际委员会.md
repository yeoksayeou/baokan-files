Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 11th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on March 10th that in recent days, American news agencies along with radio broadcasts from Saigon and Vientiane have been clamoring that the Cambodian government has requested the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Cambodia to cease its activities and to withdraw from the country.

The Vientiane radio broadcast on March 8th that Cambodian ambassadors to various countries have issued notes to foreign ministries regarding this issue. They will notify the nine countries participating in the Geneva Conference, insisting that the International Supervisory and Control Commission has "interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs."

Radio Phaya broadcast on March 1st that the International Supervisory and Control Commission is very concerned about the Kingdom of Cambodia's intention to amend the constitution regarding universal suffrage.

According to the same radio station, the International Supervisory and Control Commission believes that all measures related to universal suffrage should not discriminate against those who previously participated in patriotic wars or members of the opposition party. The International Supervisory and Control Commission believes that Cambodian residents should enjoy the freedom to participate in elections once they cooperate with the Kingdom government, while the Kingdom government believes that former opposition parties and those who have not resided in a certain place for three years should not participate in elections.

The Vietnam News Agency said: Everyone recognizes that the attitude of the International Supervisory and Control Commission is fully in line with the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference regarding the holding of universal suffrage in Cambodia and the tasks of the International Supervisory and Control Commission.

Article 3 of the Final Declaration clearly stipulates: The Conference takes note of the statements by the Governments of Cambodia and Laos to the effect that they will take measures to permit all citizens to take their part in the national life, in particular in the forthcoming general elections, which, in conformity with the constitutions of these countries, shall be held by secret ballot and on conditions of respect for fundamental freedoms.

Article 48 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia stipulates that all Cambodians over the age of twenty may participate in elections. Article 15 of the Constitution stipulates that the government cannot prevent the exercise of civil rights guaranteed by this Constitution.

The Vietnam News Agency said: In view of these considerations, and in order to correctly implement its task stipulated in Article 13 of the Cambodian Ceasefire Agreement, which is to supervise and monitor both sides' implementation of the agreement, the International Supervisory and Control Commission cannot agree to the aforementioned amendment to the constitution, because doing so is obviously a violation of the ceasefire agreement.

However, the American imperialists and their followers are clamoring that the International Supervisory and Control Commission has interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs, and are demanding the dissolution of the International Supervisory and Control Commission under this pretext.

This is a conspiracy by the American imperialists and their followers to obstruct the International Supervisory and Control Commission from completing its tasks, in order to undermine the ceasefire agreement, undermine free elections in Cambodia, and turn Cambodia into an American military base. This undoubtedly proves that the American imperialists are actually shamelessly interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs.

The Vietnam News Agency pointed out: Coordinating with their conspiracy to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, the American imperialists are now slandering the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina, with the aim of concealing their conspiracy to undermine peace and undermine the ceasefire agreement.

The treacherous conspiracy of the American imperialists and their followers will inevitably be strongly opposed by the Cambodian people, and will be severely condemned by all peace-loving people who are deeply concerned about the correct implementation of the Cambodian ceasefire agreement.

    越南通讯社发表评论
    谴责美国企图破坏柬埔寨国际委员会
    【新华社河内十一日电】越南通讯社十日报道说：最近几天，美国通讯社同西贡和万象的电台广播一直在叫嚷说，柬埔寨政府已经要求在柬埔寨的国际监督和监察委员会停止活动，并且要求它撤出这个国家。
    万象电台三月八日广播说，柬埔寨驻各国的大使们已经就这个问题向各国外交部提出照会，他们将通知参加日内瓦会议的九个国家，硬说国际监督和监察委员会“干涉了柬埔寨的内政”。
    法亚电台在三月一日的广播中说，国际监督和监察委员会对于柬埔寨王国政府打算修改宪法中关于普选的规定的意图非常担心。
    据同一电台说，国际监督和监察委员会认为，和普选有关的一切措施不得对以前参加爱国战争的人们或反对党的成员有任何歧视。国际监督和监察委员会认为，柬埔寨居民一旦和王国政府合作，就应该享有参加选举的自由，而王国政府认为，前反对派和那些在一定地方居住不足三年的人们不能参加选举。
    越南通讯社说：每个人都承认，国际监督和监察委员会的态度，是完全符合日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言关于在柬埔寨举行普选和关于国际监督和监察委员会任务的规定的精神和文字的。
    最后宣言的第三条清楚地规定：会议注意到柬埔寨和老挝政府的声明，即两国政府愿意采取使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活的措施，特别是参加最近的普选，此项普选将在一九五五年内根据各该国宪法在尊重基本自由的条件下以秘密投票方式举行。
    柬埔寨王国宪法第四十八条规定，凡二十岁以上的柬埔寨人都可参加选举。宪法第十五条规定，政府不能阻止已为本宪法所保证的民权的行使。
    越南通讯社说：鉴于这些考虑，以及由于正确执行柬埔寨停止敌对行动协定第十三条所规定的它的任务，即监督和监察双方对协定的履行，国际监督和监察委员会决不能同意上述的修改宪法，因为这样做显然是违反停战协定的。
    但是，美帝国主义者和它的随从却大声叫嚷说国际监督和监察委员会干涉了柬埔寨的内政，并且根据这个借口要求解散国际监督和监察委员会。
    这是美帝国主义者和它的追随者阻挠国际监督和监察委员会完成它的任务的阴谋，以便破坏停战协定，破坏柬埔寨的自由普选，并且把柬埔寨变成美国的一个军事基地。这不容置疑地证明了，美帝国主义者实际上是在无耻地干涉柬埔寨的内政。
    越南通讯社指出：美帝国主义者配合他们解散朝鲜中立国监察委员会的阴谋，现在诬蔑印度支那的国际监督和监察委员会，其目的在于掩盖他们破坏和平和破坏停战协定的阴谋。
    美帝国主义者和它的随从的背信弃义的阴谋必将遭到柬埔寨人民的强烈反对，并且将遭到一切深切关怀正确履行柬埔寨停战协定的爱好和平的人们的严厉谴责。
