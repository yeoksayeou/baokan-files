　　Lhasa Tibetan people celebrated the Tibetan New Year's Day 15th Butter Lamp Festival on the evening of the 8th. That evening, around the Jokhang Temple, tall pagoda-shaped flower racks were erected on Barkhor Street, and citizens and farmers and herdsmen came to the city center from all directions. Some elderly people who did not often come to the city from across the river also came to see the lanterns from the newly built Lhasa River Bridge. At night, suonas and Buddhist drums played in the city, and thousands of butter lamps and gas lamps were lit together. The crowded people watched the colorful and sparkling flower offerings and silk flowers on the flower racks. The Tibetan local government sent Zasa Tsering Dorje and Miben (Mayor) Tsetan to lead the Han and Tibetan cadres of various agencies in Lhasa and officials of the Kashag to see the lanterns together.

    拉萨市藏族人民欢度灯节
    拉萨市藏族人民在八日晚欢度藏历元月十五灯节。当天黄昏，围绕大昭寺的八角街上搭起了高大的塔形花架，市民和农牧民从四面八方来到市中心。河对岸有些不常进城的老人们，也从新建的拉萨河大桥上过来观灯。入夜，在市区内唢呐、佛鼓奏响，千万盏酥油灯和汽灯齐明，拥挤的人群观赏着花架上缤纷闪烁的花供和绢花。西藏地方政府派札萨擦绒·达瓦札堆和米本（市长）采旦带领拉萨市各机关汉、藏族干部和噶厦官员一起看了花灯。（新华社）
