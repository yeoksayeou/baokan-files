Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd dispatch from London: The British Parliament's House of Commons began a two-day debate on the government's armaments plan on the 1st. In this plan, the British government openly proposed to manufacture atomic and hydrogen weapons.

British Prime Minister Churchill spoke first. He defended the atomic and hydrogen weapon race and advocated the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons in war. He said it would be foolish not to use these weapons if a war broke out.

After Churchill's speech, Shinwell spoke on behalf of the opposition party, the Labour Party. Shinwell's speech, like the Labour Party parliamentary group's so-called "amendment" to the government's proposal on armaments, expressed agreement with the substance of Churchill's armaments plan. He expressed satisfaction with Churchill's speech and the earlier decision of the North Atlantic Alliance Council regarding preparations for atomic warfare, because "it is now clear" that the British government does not intend to use such weapons only after others use hydrogen weapons against it.

Shinwell only criticized the part of the government's plan concerning conventional armaments.

Like Churchill, Shinwell used the threat of atomic bombs to intimidate the public in order to facilitate the government's expansion of armaments.

Some Labour representatives expressed timid unease in their speeches, an unease that many Britons now feel as they watch the ruling groups of Western countries engage in an arms race while refusing to hold negotiations and reach agreements.

Labour MP Paget said he did not support the government's and opposition party's advocacy of manufacturing hydrogen bombs. He further said that on this issue, some people have already gone "far enough" "down a slippery slope to hell," and it is time to stop somewhere.

Labour MP Acland also said that he did not support the government or the Labour Party parliamentary group's amendment, because both the government and the Labour Party parliamentary group support the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.

Labour MP Fienburgh said that once hydrogen bombs are used, the British Isles would be in an easily bombed position. He said: "The government has already agreed to gamble everything."

According to the British News Agency, Labour MPs Driberg and Acland have submitted an amendment to the House of Commons, suggesting that the House of Commons refuse to agree to the manufacture of hydrogen weapons, and demanding that the government propose suggestions in the current disarmament negotiations or at any appropriate time in order to achieve a universal ban on nuclear weapons. This amendment reflects the growing opposition of the broad masses of the British people to the war policies of the government and the right-wing elements of the Labour Party.

### 邱吉尔公然主张制造和使用原子武器  部分工党议员建议下院拒绝同意制造氢弹

    邱吉尔公然主张制造和使用原子武器
    部分工党议员建议下院拒绝同意制造氢弹
    【新华社三日讯】　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国议会下院在一日开始就政府的军备计划举行为期两天的辩论。在这个计划中，英国政府公然提出要制造原子武器和氢武器。
    英国首相邱吉尔首先发言。他为原子武器和氢武器竞赛辩护，并且主张在战争中使用原子武器和氢武器。他说，如果发生战争，不用这些武器就是愚蠢的。
    邱吉尔发言后，辛威尔代表反对党——工党发言。辛威尔的发言同工党议会党团对政府关于军备计划的提案的所谓“修正案”一样，表示同意邱吉尔的军备计划的实质，他对邱吉尔的发言和早些时候北大西洋联盟理事会关于准备原子战争的决定表示满意，因为“现在已经明确”：英国政府不打算到别人用氢武器来对付它的时候，才使用这种武器。
    辛威尔仅仅批评了政府计划中关于常规军备的那一部分。
    辛威尔像邱吉尔一样，以原子弹威胁来恫吓公众，借以便利政府扩充军备。
    某些工党代表在发言中畏怯地表示出不安的情绪，这种不安情绪是现在许多英国人所感受到的，因为他们眼看西方国家的统治集团从事军备竞赛，而拒绝举行谈判和达成协议。
    工党议员帕吉特说，他不支持政府和反对党赞成制造氢弹的主张。他进一步说：在这个问题上，有人已经“沿着通向地狱的滑溜溜的小路”走得“够远了”，现在应该在某个地方停下来了。
    工党议员艾克兰德也说，他既不支持政府，也不支持工党议会党团的修正案，因为无论政府和工党议会党团都是赞成制造氢弹的。
    工党议员芬布格说，一旦使用氢弹，英伦三岛就会处于容易挨炸的地位。他说：“政府是已经同意作孤注一掷的。”
    据英国新闻联合社报道，工党议员德里柏和艾克兰德已经向下院提出了一个修正案，建议下院拒绝同意制造氢武器，并且要求政府在目前的裁减军备谈判中或者在任何适当的时机提出建议，以便实现普遍禁止核子武器。这个修正案反映了英国广大人民对于政府和工党右翼分子的战争政策的日益高涨的反对情绪。
