The Jin Hua Pig Farm, Out of Touch With the Masses

To the Editor:

South of our county seat, there is a state-owned Jin Hua Pig Farm. It has over a thousand mu of land and 4,000 square meters of buildings. The pig farm is surrounded by a dense bamboo fence, and no one except its own staff is allowed to enter. The nearby farmers call it the "Pig Yamen" or the "Pig Mansion."

When this pig farm was being built, the farmers were full of hope that they could learn a set of advanced breeding and management methods from it. However, the reality has disappointed everyone. Although the pig farm is in our countryside and neighbors us, this "neighbor" is not friendly to us. They don't allow us to go in and see. They say we are not clean and that if we go into the farm, we will transmit bacteria to the pigs. Imagine how angry we are when we hear this! We heard that they have many good breeding pigs in the farm, and the farmers nearby who raise sows all want to have their pigs inseminated, but they say that the Jin Hua local pigs are not clean and cannot be inseminated casually. For example, the Qiubin and Chengnan townships near the pig farm have a total of four or five hundred sows. The local people have repeatedly requested the farm to help with insemination, but they have been refused. Last year, the pigs in the nearby villages suffered from swine fever. The farmers repeatedly asked their veterinarians to help treat them, but they ignored them. One farmer carried a sick pig from a distant village to seek treatment. As a result, they not only rejected the farmer's request with disgust, but also threatened the farmer, saying: "If you infect our pigs with the plague, you can't bear the responsibility."

The pig farm is also out of touch with reality in terms of breeding and management techniques. After the implementation of unified grain purchase and sales, farmers everywhere are looking for feed substitutes to feed pigs, but the pig farm uses refined feed to feed pigs. Farmers use only about 150 jin of refined feed to raise a fattened pig, while the pig farm uses 1,800 jin of refined feed to grow a fattened pig. Although it was later reduced to a standard of 900 to 1,000 jin, it is still very high compared to farmers. Therefore, farmers have reflected that this feeding method is not only not worth learning, but also dare not learn from them.

The situation of being out of touch with the masses and out of touch with reality is even more serious in terms of promoting good breeds. The breeding pigs they cultivate, weighing 20 to 25 jin, are sold for more than 40 yuan, while a farmer's large pig weighing 110 to 120 jin only sells for more than 40 yuan. Who would be willing to exchange a large pig for a small pig! In the year since the farm was established, the nearby agricultural producers' cooperatives and farmers have not bought a single breeding pig from them. The farmers said that their piglets are used to eating refined feed and living in comfortable pigsties, and we don't have these conditions! Farmers who have been fooled pointed at the pig farm and cursed, "I don't want the young masters raised in the mansion, even if you give them to me."

In general, the current Jin Hua Pig Farm is a pig farm that is out of touch with the masses and out of touch with reality. We sincerely hope that the leaders of this pig farm will earnestly improve their work and play the exemplary role of a state-owned pig farm.

### 脱离群众的金华猪场

    脱离群众的金华猪场编辑同志：
    在我们的县城南面，有一个地方国营金华猪场。这是一个有一千多亩土地，有四千平方公尺建筑物的地方。猪场的周围，拦起了一道密密的竹篱笆，非本场的人员不许进去。附近的农民都叫它“猪衙门”“猪公馆”。
    当这个猪场兴建的时候，农民们满心希望向它学习一套先进的饲养管理方法；可是，事实却给大家带来了失望。猪场虽然在我们乡间，和我们是邻居，可惜这个“邻居”对我们并不友好。他们不让我们进去看。他们说我们身上不干净，如果跑到场子里去会把细菌传染给毛猪。你想，我们听了这话怎能不生气？听说他们场里有许多很好的种猪，附近养母猪的农民都希望去配种，他们却说金华土猪不干不净怎能随便配种。如猪场附近的秋滨和城南两个乡共有四、五百只母猪，当地群众曾再三要求场里帮助配种，都被拒绝了。去年附近村子里的毛猪闹猪瘟，农民再三请求他们的兽医帮助医治，他们也没有理睬。有一个农民从远乡把病猪抬来求治，结果，他们不仅用厌恶的情绪拒绝了农民的要求，并且还恐吓农民说：把我们的毛猪传染了瘟疫你担不起这个责任。
    猪场在饲养管理的技术方面，也是脱离实际的。在实行粮食统购统销以后，各地农民都在寻找饲料代用品喂猪，而猪场却用精料喂猪，农民饲养一头肥猪，用精料不过一百五十斤左右，而猪场长成一头肥猪要吃一千八百斤精料，后来虽然减少到九百到千斤的标准，然而同农民比起来还是很高。因此，农民们纷纷反映说：这样的饲养方法不仅不值得学习，而且也不敢向他们学习。
    在推广良种方面，脱离群众脱离实际的情况那就更严重了。他们培育出来的种猪，二十斤至二十五斤重的要卖四十多元，而农民一只百一、二十斤重的大猪，才不过卖四十来元；一只大猪换一只小猪又有谁愿意哩！办场一年来，附近的农业生产合作社和农民就没有向他们买过一只种猪。农民说他们的小猪吃惯了精料，住惯了舒适的猪舍，我们哪里有这个条件呢！上过当的农民指着猪场骂道：“在公馆里养起来的少爷公子，以后送给我我也不要了。”
    总的说，现在的金华猪场是一个脱离群众、脱离实际的猪场。我们诚恳地希望这个猪场的领导人，切实地改进工作，发挥国营猪场的示范作用。
