Many state-private joint venture and some private mechanical and electrical factories in Shanghai are using cooperative production methods to manufacture new products. After a dozen or so factories that originally manufactured electric motors engaged in cooperative production, they successfully trial-produced thirteen types of electric tools for construction, and are now beginning mass production. Xinyi Machine Factory and others are cooperating to trial-produce various new types of agricultural implements. The state-private joint venture Dalong Machine Factory and Zhonghua Iron Factory, together with a group of private factories, have also cooperated to produce precision oil drilling machine parts and large-scale paper-making machines.

In order to do a good job in the technical design of certain products in cooperative production, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry has established a design office. This design office is designing Soviet-style agricultural processing machinery, meat combined processing machines, etc.

    上海许多工厂实行协作生产
    上海市公私合营及部分私营机械、电器工厂，正运用协作生产的方式制造新产品。十几家原来制造电动机的工厂，自进行协作生产后，试制成功了十三种建筑用的电动工具，现已开始大量生产。信义机器厂等正协作试制多种新式农具。公私合营大隆机器厂和中华铁工厂同一批私营工厂也协作生产出了精密的石油钻探机配件和大型造纸机。
    为了做好协作生产中某些产品的技术设计工作，上海市重工业管理局已成立了一个设计处。这个设计处正设计着苏联式农业加工机械、肉类联合加工机等。
