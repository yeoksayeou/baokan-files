Xinhua News Agency, February 28th dispatch: According to TASS reports: The public in Egypt and Lebanon expressed indignation at the military treaty signed by Turkey and Iraq on the 24th.

    Egyptian newspapers emphasized that the collusion between Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and Turkish Prime Minister Menderes harbors a great danger of dragging Arab countries into military alliances and Western military adventures. "Al-Gomhuria" pointed out that the Nuri al-Said and Menderes pact "betrayed the interests of the Arab people." The newspaper wrote: "The Turkish-Iraqi treaty gives American troops the right to occupy Iraq."

    A correspondent for "Akhbar El Yom" magazine in London pointed out in a report that Britain intends to use the method of pulling Iraq into a military bloc to consolidate its military bases and other privileges granted to Britain under the 1930 British-Iraqi treaty, which the Iraqi public is resolutely demanding to abolish.

    Lebanese "Al-Telegraph" reported that Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party leader Jumblatt told a reporter from Egypt's "Al-Ahram" newspaper: "Lebanese public opinion opposes the Turkish-Iraqi alliance. ... We believe that this military alliance is against the interests of the Arab peoples. The leaders of the Arab countries must be Arabs, not Turks. Otherwise, we will return to the dark ages of Turkish rule."

    Xinhua News Agency, March 1st dispatch: TASS Beirut, February 28th telegram: According to a "Al-Telegraph" correspondent in Baghdad, the Iraqi people oppose the hastily signed Turkish-Iraqi military treaty.

    Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, anticipating that the people would oppose the signing of the treaty with Turkey, ordered the Iraqi armed forces and police to prepare for combat to prevent demonstrations against the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.

    However, many actions against the Turkish-Iraqi treaty still occurred in Iraq. For example, in Amara, Al-Hai and other cities, residents clashed with police. As a result, some people were injured.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 1st dispatch: TASS Cairo, February 28th telegram: Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salah Salem, continued to hold talks with Syrian authorities in Damascus. According to the Arab News Agency, Salem proposed to the Syrian government a plan to organize a new Arab League, excluding Iraq, which had signed a separate military treaty with Turkey.

    埃及、黎巴嫩等国人民反对土伊军事条约
    埃及准备组织一个没有伊拉克参加的新的阿拉伯联盟
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社报道：埃及和黎巴嫩公众对于土耳其和伊拉克在二十四日签订的军事条约表示愤慨。
    埃及报纸着重指出，伊拉克首相努里·赛义德和土耳其总理曼德列斯的勾结包藏着把阿拉伯国家拖进军事联盟和西方国家军事冒险的很大危险。“共和国报”指出，努里·赛义德和曼德列斯的盟约“出卖了阿拉伯人民的利益”。这家报纸写道：“土耳其—伊拉克条约给了美国军队占领伊拉克的权利。”
      “今日消息”杂志驻伦敦记者在报道中指出，英国打算利用把伊拉克拉进军事集团的方式，来巩固自己的军事基地，以及巩固根据一九三零年英国—伊拉克条约所给予英国的其他特权，而这个条约是伊拉克公众坚决要求废除的。
    黎巴嫩“电讯报”报道，黎巴嫩社会主义进步党领袖琼布拉特对埃及“金字塔报”记者说：“黎巴嫩舆论反对土耳其—伊拉克联盟。……我们认为这个军事联盟是违反阿拉伯各国人民的利益的。阿拉伯各国的领导者必须是阿拉伯人，而不是土耳其人。否则，我们将会回到土耳其统治的黑暗时代去。”
      【新华社一日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特二月二十八日电：据黎巴嫩“电讯报”驻巴格达记者报道，伊拉克人民反对匆忙签订的土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。
    伊拉克首相努里·赛义德预料到人民群众会反对和土耳其签订这个条约，就命令伊拉克的武装部队和警察进行战斗准备，防止发生反对土耳其—伊拉克条约的示威游行。
    但是，在伊拉克还是发生了许多反对土耳其—伊拉克条约的行动。例如，在阿马拉、阿尔—哈伊和其他城市，居民和警察发生了冲突。结果有人受伤。
      【新华社一日讯】塔斯社开罗二月二十八日讯：埃及国家指导部部长赛拉·萨勒姆在大马士革继续同叙利亚当局举行会谈。据阿拉伯新闻社消息，萨勒姆向叙利亚政府提出组织一个新的阿拉伯联盟的方案，新的联盟不让同土耳其签订单独的军事条约的伊拉克参加。
