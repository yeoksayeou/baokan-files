    Wang Mang Village: Every Household Raises Pigs
    By Our Correspondent Li Gendi
    Wang Mang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, is a well-known model village for mutual aid and cooperation. In the early days of liberation, the entire village only raised 60 pigs, and very few were fattened; in 1954, the village supplied the state with 159 head of hogs, nearly one hog supplied per household on average.
    The development of pig raising as a sideline in Wang Mang Village is inextricably linked to the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Of the 167 households in the village, 90 had joined mutual aid teams by 1951. Village activists such as Pu Zhongzhi, Gai Jidong, and Hou Qinghan actively advocated raising pigs for manure accumulation while leading farmers inside and outside the mutual aid teams to carry out production increase campaigns. Farmer Yi Shenglian had been raising pigs for ten years, earning profits of 300,000 to 500,000 yuan annually (old currency); Bai Zhenyi raised pigs for five years, gaining a net income of 1.26 million yuan, equivalent to a year and a half's regular household expenses. They used these facts to encourage the masses and, with the mutual aid and cooperative organizations as the center, mobilized the masses to implement the method of "household helping household" and "neighbor helping neighbor" to solve the difficulties in manpower and financial resources in building pigsties and purchasing piglets. The surplus feed from collective tofu making within the mutual aid team was also used to collectively raise a small number of pigs. This not only solved the problem of insufficient fertilizer in the whole village but also greatly promoted the development of the pig raising industry. In 1952, the number of pigs raised in the whole village doubled compared to 1949.
    In 1953, Wang Mang Village began to shift towards collectivization, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives increased to four, with members increasing from 14 households to more than 150 households. The development of agricultural cooperatives provided more favorable conditions for pig raising as a sideline. Agricultural cooperatives centralized the management of livestock, saving more than 80 livestock houses for all farmers in the village, some of which were converted into pigsties. Because livestock was fed centrally, with the cooperative responsible for supplying feed, all cooperative members could save more than 210 shi of wheat bran and 300,000 jin of grain and rice bran annually, which solved the problem of the source of roughage for the pigs. In the past, households without livestock had to pay livestock raising households for using their livestock to grind grain; with the agricultural cooperative grinding grain, members could keep the bran as feed. The agricultural cooperative fairly stipulated the price of pig manure, with each pig accumulating 100 to 200 baskets of manure a year, worth about 130,000 to 200,000 yuan, which could almost offset the cost of roughage. These conditions ensured that each pig raising household could obtain a net profit of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per year. According to the estimated number of pigs sold in Wang Mang Village in 1954, the total net profit from pig raising in the village was about 17.8 million yuan.
    Compared to mutual aid teams and individual farmers, agricultural cooperatives themselves have more favorable conditions for developing pig raising as a sideline. The agricultural cooperative in Wang Mang Village has a flour mill, with flour soup used as livestock drink and flour residue used to feed pigs. The flour mill regularly feeds forty to fifty large pigs.
    As a result of collectivization, the pig raising industry in Wang Mang Village has developed more rapidly. In 1953, the number of pigs in the village increased by 47, accounting for 78 percent of the total number of pigs in 1949. Although the village suffered a severe swine fever in 1954, which killed more than 40 pigs, the total number of pigs in the village still increased by 83 percent compared to 1949. According to the village's production plan this year, the number of hogs to be sold to the state alone is ten more than the number of pigs raised last year, averaging more than one sold per household.
    After the general line publicity and education began at the end of 1953, the Wang Mang Village Party organization mobilized farmers to sell hogs to the state to support urban industrial construction. The agricultural cooperative was the first to respond by selling all of its hogs to the state. Cadres of the agricultural cooperative assured the supply and marketing cooperative that they would sell qualified hogs to the state and that the supply and marketing cooperative could come to the agricultural cooperative at any time to select and purchase qualified hogs whenever the cities, industrial and mining areas needed them.

### 家家户户养猪的王莽村

    家家户户养猪的王莽村
    本报记者　李根蒂
    陕西省长安县王莽村是有名的互助合作模范村。解放初期全村只养猪六十口，喂得肥的很少；一九五四年全村供给国家的毛猪就有一百五十九口，接近平均一户供应一口猪。
    王莽村养猪副业的发展是和互助合作运动的迅速发展分不开的。全村有一百六十七户居民，一九五一年就有九十户参加了互助组。村里的积极分子蒲忠智、盖冀东、侯清汉等在领导互助组内外农民开展增产运动时，积极提倡养猪积肥。农民益生连养猪十年，每年获利三十万元到五十万元（旧币，下同），白振义养猪五年，获得纯收益一百二十六万元，等于全家一年半的经常开支。他们用这些事实鼓励群众，并以互助合作组织为中心发动群众实行“户帮户”“邻帮邻”的办法，来解决打猪圈和购买小猪当中人力、财力的困难。互助组内集体做豆腐节余的饲料也集体饲养少数的猪。这样不但解决了全村肥料不足的问题，而且也大大地推动了养猪业的发展。一九五二年，全村养的猪比一九四九年增加了一倍。
      一九五三年王莽村开始转向合作化，农业生产合作社发展到四个，社员由十四户增加到一百五十多户。农业社的发展，给养猪副业提供了更有利的条件。农业社把牲畜集中管理，为全村农户约节余出八十多间牲畜房，其中一部分被改作猪圈。由于牲畜集中喂养，由社负责供给饲料，全体社员每年约可节余麦麸二百一十多石，谷、稻糠秕三十万斤，这样就解决了猪的粗饲料来源问题。从前，无牲畜户用别人的牲畜磨、碾粮食，麸、糠得付给养畜户，农业社磨、碾粮食，社员可以留下麸糠作饲料。农业社公平地规定出猪肥的价格，每口猪一年可积肥一百筐到二百筐，约值十三万元到二十多万元，差不多可以抵消粗饲料的成本。这些条件保证了每个养猪户每年可得到二十万到三十万元的纯利。根据王莽村一九五四年卖猪数量估计，全村养猪的纯利约有一千七百八十万元。
    比起互助组和个体农民来，农业社本身发展养猪副业的条件也更优越。王莽村农业社开有粉坊，粉汤作牲口饮料，粉渣饲猪，粉坊经常喂养着四、五十口大猪。
    合作化的结果，使王莽村养猪业更迅速地发展起来。一九五三年全村猪数增加了四十七口，为一九四九年猪的总数的百分之七十八。一九五四年虽然全村发生了一次严重猪瘟，病死了四十多口猪，但全村猪的总数仍比一九四九年增加了百分之八十三。今年根据全村的生产计划，仅准备卖给国家的毛猪就比去年喂的猪数多十口，平均每户出售一口以上。
    一九五三年年底开始总路线宣传教育以后，王莽村党组织发动农民把毛猪卖给国家，支援城市工业建设。农业社首先响应把毛猪全部卖给国家。农业社的干部向供销社保证：要把合乎标准的毛猪卖给国家，城市、工矿区什么时候需要，供销社可以随时到农业社来挑选收购合格的毛猪。
