Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 5th: The World Federation of Trade Unions, in commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day, has issued an appeal to women worldwide.

    In its appeal to women worldwide, the World Federation of Trade Unions extends its congratulations to the Women's International Democratic Federation and to women all over the world.
    The appeal states that the World Federation of Trade Unions is fully aware that the participation of women in public life is an important factor in the struggle to improve living and working conditions, to strive for and defend trade union rights, democratic freedoms, and peace.
    Today, a grave danger threatens working people. In Europe, this danger is manifested in the Paris Agreements and attempts to rearm West Germany; in Asia, it is manifested in the provocations of the imperialists against the Chinese people. The danger of atomic war looms over the whole world. The people of all countries have risen up to fight against this threat.
    The appeal concludes: The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on working women to join trade unions and to intensify their common struggle to improve living conditions and thwart the conspiracies of the warmongers.

    为纪念“三八”国际妇女节
    世界工会联合会发表告全世界妇女书
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会联合会为了纪念“三八”国际妇女节，发表了告全世界妇女书。
    世界工会联合会在告全世界妇女书中向国际民主妇女联合会和全世界妇女表示祝贺。
    告全世界妇女书说，世界工会联合会非常了解，妇女参加公共生活是争取改善生活和工作条件、争取和保卫工会权利、民主自由和和平的斗争的一个重要因素。
    今天有一种严重的危险威胁着劳动人民。在欧洲，这种危险表现在巴黎协定和重新武装西德的尝试上；在亚洲，则表现在帝国主义者对中国人民的挑衅上。原子战争的危险正笼罩着全世界。各国人民已经起来为反对这种威胁而进行斗争。
    告全世界妇女书说：世界工会联合会号召劳动妇女们加入工会，并且为改善生活条件和挫败战争贩子的阴谋而加紧进行她们共同的斗争。
