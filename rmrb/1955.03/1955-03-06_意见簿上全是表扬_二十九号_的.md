The suggestion book is full of praise for "Number Twenty-Nine"

During the winter vacation, I took the train from Ulanhot to Zhalantun.

As soon as the passengers got on the train and sat down, a loud voice rang in my ears:

"Fellow passengers, this train is the No. 290 ordinary passenger train going from Arxan to Baichengzi. You are on the people's train, so feel at home. If you need anything, please feel free to ask me; I am here to serve everyone in this carriage...."

The speaker was a train attendant of about twenty years old, tall, with a plump and red face. His armband said Number Twenty-Nine. He seemed like a gentle and enthusiastic young man.

He immediately registered the seat numbers and destinations of the passengers, so he could remind them when it was time to get off.

"Number Twenty-Nine" saw two elderly people sitting close to the carriage door. He immediately found an empty seat in the middle of the carriage and "transferred" the older gentleman there first; but there was no second empty seat. What to do about the other old man?

"Number Twenty-Nine's" loud voice rang out again:

"Passengers, there is an elderly gentleman sitting at the door of our carriage. Elderly people are prone to catching colds. Which young and strong passenger would like to switch seats with him?"

More than a dozen voices answered the request at the same time.

"Number Twenty-Nine" began to sweep the floor. When he swept in front of someone, that person lifted their feet; the train attendant smiled at the passenger who lifted their feet, indicating "excuse me."

Every few minutes, he asked the passengers for their opinions: Was it hot? Was it cold? Did they want the heating on or off? And so on.

He advised tired people to take a nap and introduced methods for sleeping in the chairs.

He asked if anyone wanted to play cards and took out playing cards to lend to the passengers.

He advised people who were talking to keep their voices down, so as not to disturb others who were sleeping.

It was almost time to reach Zhenxi Station. He explained the precautions for getting on and off the train, and then asked the passengers getting off to line up in order. The train stopped, and he hurried off through the back door. A moment later, he came back on the train, holding a child in one hand and carrying a child in the other. He put the two children on the seat and told the older child to look after the younger one, and then he hurried off again. The second time he got on the train, he had a large luggage bag on his back and another garment bag under his arm; the third time, he carried a garment bag in one hand and helped an old lady with the other.

In just these brief two minutes, "Number Twenty-Nine" went in and out like a shuttle, finally ensuring that every passenger was safely seated. He did not allow himself a second of slack.

The passengers were moved by the service attitude of "Number Twenty-Nine," and everyone unanimously advocated praising him.

Everyone gathered around to come up with ideas. Some advocated writing this, and some advocated writing that. At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly said calmly:

"Passengers, none of this is worth writing; this is what he should do as his duty, and he has not done it well yet...."

People were in an uproar—who uttered such an unreasonable remark! When everyone saw who was speaking, their mood calmed down: Oh, it's you, Comrade "Number Twenty-Nine"!

The praise opinions were written, and those who could write signed their names, and those who could not write asked others to sign for them.

I carefully looked through this "Passenger Suggestion Book."

From January 4th of this year to January 19th (the day I took the train), only half a month, a total of one hundred and three pages were filled, with a total of six hundred and seventy-five signatures, as well as eleven group signatures, such as "Ulanhot Workers and Peasants Quick Course Middle School," "Tulihe 308 Construction Site," etc.

All one hundred and three pages were praising "Number Twenty-Nine."

If you ask "Number Twenty-Nine's" name, his name is Chen Liqu.

### 意见簿上全是表扬“二十九号”的

    意见簿上全是表扬“二十九号”的
    寒假，我从乌兰浩特搭火车去扎兰屯。
    旅客们刚刚上车，坐下来，一阵宏亮的声音在我的耳边响着：
    “诸位旅客，我们这次列车，是从阿尔山开往白城子去的二百九十次普通客车。诸位坐上了人民的列车就像回到家一样，有什么事情请不客气地找我吧；我是在这节车厢为大家服务的。……”
    讲话的人是一个二十岁左右的列车员，高高的个儿，又胖又红的脸，他的袖标是二十九号。看来是一个温和的、热情的小伙子。
    他紧跟着就把旅客们的座号和目的地作了登记，准备到时好叫旅客下车。
    “二十九号”看见两个老年人坐在紧靠车厢门口，他立刻在车厢中间找到了一个空位子，先把一位年纪大一些的老大爷“转移”到那儿去；但是没有第二个空位子，还有一位老大爷，怎么办呢？
    “二十九号”宏亮的嗓子又响开了：
      “旅客们，咱们这一节车厢门口坐着一位老大爷，老年人容易感冒。哪位年轻身体棒的旅客愿意和他换换位子？”
    十几个声音同时答应了这个要求。
    “二十九号”开始扫地了。当他扫到谁面前时，谁就抬起了脚；列车员对抬脚的旅客笑了笑，表示“打搅了”。
    每隔几分钟，他就向旅客们征求一次意见：热不热？冷不冷？是要放暖气还是要关暖气？等等。
    他劝疲乏了的人睡一睡，并且介绍了在椅子上睡觉的方法。
    他问有谁想打扑克，他掏出扑克来借给旅客。
    他劝讲话的人声音放低些，以免打扰了别人睡觉。
    快到镇西车站了。他讲解了上下车应注意事项，然后让下车的旅客顺序排队。车停了，他匆匆地从后门下去了。一会儿，他一手牵着一个小孩，一手抱着一个小孩上车了。他把两个小孩放在座位上，嘱咐大一点的孩子看着那小一点的小孩，然后他又匆匆地下去了。第二次上车时，他背上背了一个大行李包，胁下又夹了一个衣包；第三次，他一手提了一个衣包，一手搀扶着一位老太太。
    就在这短促的两分钟时间，“二十九号”像穿梭一样地出出进进，终于使每一个旅客安全地入了座。他不让他自己有一秒钟的松懈。
    旅客们被“二十九号”的服务态度感动了，大家一致主张表扬他。
    大家围拢来出主意，有人主张写这，有人主张写那。这时人群中突然有人平静地说：
    “旅客们，这些都不值得写，这是他分内应做的事，他还没有做好。……”
    人们沸腾了——是谁冒出这么一句不通情理的话！等到大伙看清了说话的人时，心情才平复了：原来是你呀，“二十九号”同志！
    表扬的意见写完了，会写字的人都签了名，不会写字的人就请人代签。
    我仔细地翻看了这个“旅客意见簿”。
    从今年一月四日开始到一月十九日（我坐车的日子）为止，不过半个月的时间，共写满了一百零三页，签名的人共六百七十五人，还有十一个团体签名，如“乌兰浩特工农速成中学”、“图里河三○八工地”等。
    这一百零三页中，全都是表扬“二十九号”的。
    若问“二十九号”的姓名，他就叫陈立求。
