Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: Taiwanese women under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are suffering cruel torment and abuse.

    According to Taiwanese and Hong Kong newspapers, the current number of unemployed people in Taiwan is approximately 800,000. This number does not include Taiwanese women, who face even greater difficulties in finding employment. Even when they do find work, they are subjected to various forms of discrimination and oppression. In many Taiwanese businesses and factories, female workers' wages are only one-third of male workers' wages. Due to the devaluation of counterfeit currency and soaring prices, many families relying on wage income find it increasingly difficult to support themselves, leading to frequent family tragedies.

    Many ordinary families in Taiwan are forced to sell their children due to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's exorbitant taxes, usurious exploitation, and the threat of unemployment. Advertisements for selling children are frequently published in newspapers. According to statistics from Chiang's institutions at the end of December 1951, there were already more than 125,000 "adopted daughters" in Taiwan at that time. Many adult Taiwanese women are forced into prostitution through violence or economic hardship; Taipei City alone has over 10,000 prostitutes.

    Taiwanese women also suffer political persecution from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. In the many concentration camps and prisons established by Chiang, numerous Taiwanese women are being tortured for resisting Chiang's rule. In the Green Island concentration camp, many Taiwanese women remain steadfast and unyielding under the brutal torture of Chiang's secret agents, and many have been murdered. Taiwanese women deeply resent the tyrannical rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and incidents of women beating up Chiang's conscription and tax collection personnel have occurred in some areas.

    台湾妇女在蒋贼统治下灾难深重
    据新华社七日讯：在蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾妇女，正受着残酷折磨和蹂躏。
    据台湾和香港报刊透露，现在台湾的失业人口约有八十多万人，这个数目还没有包括台湾妇女在内，台湾妇女要找职业更加困难；而且找到职业，也要受到种种歧视和压迫。台湾许多商行和工厂内，女工工资只占男工工资的三分之一。由于伪币贬值，物价高涨，许多靠工资收入的家庭越来越不易维持一家生活，因而经常发生家庭惨剧。
    台湾许多普通家庭因蒋介石卖国集团的苛捐酷税以及高利贷盘剥和失业威胁，被迫卖儿卖女。报纸上经常刊登卖儿卖女的广告。据蒋贼机关一九五一年十二月底的统计，当时全台湾“养女”已达十二万五千多人。台湾不少成年妇女为暴力胁迫或为生活所迫沦为娼妓，仅台北市就有妓女一万多名。
    台湾妇女同样遭受蒋介石卖国集团的政治迫害。在蒋贼设立的许多集中营和监狱中，有不少台湾妇女因反抗蒋贼统治正在受着折磨。在火烧岛集中营内，许多台湾妇女在蒋贼特务的酷刑摧残下坚贞不屈，不少人被屠杀。台湾妇女痛恨蒋介石卖国集团的暴虐统治，有一些地方发生过妇女痛殴蒋贼征兵征税人员的事件。
