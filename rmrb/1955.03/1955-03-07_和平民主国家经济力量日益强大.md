The economic strength of peaceful democratic countries is growing.

    The Soviet machine-building industry saw huge development last year.

    In 1954, the heart of Soviet heavy industry—the machine-building industry—continued to advance by leaps and bounds, with the output of many products increasing compared to 1953.

    Various machine-building departments created many new types and brands of machinery and equipment, expanding the scope of automation and mechanization.

    In terms of machine tool manufacturing, the Soviet Union created more than 200 new types of automatic and semi-automatic machines last year, capable of processing parts ranging from 1 millimeter in diameter to 200-300 tons in weight. The linked lathe produced by the Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory can perform 80 to 120 operations simultaneously, replacing ten lathes. A machine manufacturing plant in New Kramatorsk, famous throughout the Soviet Union, manufactured a powerful giant linked machine for rolling steel channels, rails, and I-beams, weighing over 9,700 tons and requiring almost no manual labor during operation.

    Last year, the Soviet light and food industries received many new types of machines from the machine-building industry. The textile industry alone received about 50 new types of machines, mainly automatic and semi-automatic machines. Soviet designers designed an automatic loom for linen factories that is four times more efficient than older machines. A circular automatic loom created last year is three times more productive than ordinary automatic looms.

    In the past year, the Soviet machine-building industry has vigorously supported the development of agriculture. A total of 183,000 tractors were supplied this year, 26,000 more than in 1953. Machine-building industrial enterprises and scientific research institutions designed and manufactured more than 200 new types of agricultural machinery.

    Romania's agricultural production tasks for this year.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, spoke at the National Conference of Advanced Agricultural Workers, discussing Romania's tasks for developing agricultural production in 1955.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that Romania's investment in agriculture in 1955 will be almost 2.8 billion lei (Romanian currency), and loans to farmers will triple compared to last year. This year, more than 2,500 tractors, more than 4,300 tractor-drawn plows, more than 1,500 grain sowing machines, and many other agricultural machines and tools will be supplied to agriculture.

    Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the reason why it is now possible to equip agriculture with tractors and modern agricultural machinery is because the people's democratic government attaches great importance to heavy industry, especially the machine-building industry established after the founding of the people's regime. The Party and the government will continue to resolutely follow the principles of Marxism-Leninism to implement the policy of building a socialist economy, and constantly develop heavy industry, because it is the foundation for developing the entire national economy and the source of improving the welfare of the working people.

    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that increasing grain production is the most important task in developing agriculture. In Romanian agriculture, corn occupies an important position. In the spring of 1954, the Party and the government had already taken some measures to expand the planting area of ​​corn, thus increasing the planting area by 400,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) compared with 1953, and the total output of corn exceeded 6 million tons. A particularly important task for agricultural workers this year is to strive for a bumper harvest of various crops, mainly to strive for a harvest of 10 million tons of wheat and corn, and to make the yield per unit area of ​​corn reach at least 2,000 kilograms per hectare. In addition, it is necessary to attach great importance to increasing the yield of potatoes, sugar beets, sunflowers and other crops.

    Poland's rural electrification is progressing rapidly.

    In 1954, 593 villages in Poland received electricity supply, about 45 percent more than the villages that received electricity supply in 1953. In addition, 300 state farms, 232 large-scale agricultural production cooperatives, and 53 machine tractor stations across the country have implemented electrification.

    The fastest progress in rural electrification in Poland has been in the central and eastern regions. Last year, 77 villages in Warsaw Province received electricity supply, 70 in Lublin Province, and 62 in Kielce Province.

    Last year, Poland erected a total of 1,484 kilometers of high-voltage power lines and 1,883 kilometers of low-voltage power lines. In addition, 781 transformer substations were built.

    In 1955, more than 770 villages, 330 state farms, and many agricultural production cooperatives in Poland will be electrified.

    Bulgaria is building the largest power project in the country.

    Bulgaria's largest power project—the Batak Hydropower Complex—is under construction. At the construction site in the Rhodope Mountains, workers are enthusiastically excavating tunnels, and by the end of 1954, they had dug 7 kilometers of tunnels. Important components of the hydropower complex include the "Batak", "Aleko" and "Beshter" hydropower station projects. Construction personnel will lay underground water pipes for these hydropower stations and dig canals on the ground to divert water from large reservoirs in the central Rhodope Mountains.

    The Batak Hydropower Complex started construction in the second half of 1954. The construction site covers an area of ​​3,600 square kilometers. During construction, the tunnels excavated alone are 78 kilometers long, which is twice the length of the tunnels excavated in the entire pre-war Bulgaria. After the three hydropower station projects of the hydropower complex are completed, the power generation capacity will reach 167,000 kilowatts, which is one and a half times the total power generation capacity of the entire pre-liberation Bulgaria. After the completion of the entire project, it can also guarantee the irrigation of more than 200,000 decares (1.5 mu per decare) of land in the two states of Basagiq and Ropvdiv.

    Mongolian herders' production cooperatives are further growing.

    The summing-up work and re-election meetings of herders' production cooperatives across Mongolia have ended. These meetings have shown that the various herders' production cooperatives have further grown and consolidated in terms of organization and management.

    The herders' production cooperatives in Uvorkhangai Province achieved remarkable results in 1954. The number of members has greatly increased; in one year, the number of livestock has increased by about 30 percent. Cultivation, as a new sector of agriculture here, has also achieved further development. Many herders' production cooperatives in this region have built production housing and opened animal husbandry and veterinary stations.

    Herders' production cooperatives in Alahangai, Selenge, Khangai, Choibalsan and other regions have also achieved success.

    North Korea's machine manufacturing plants are expanding the production of new products.

    North Korea's machine-building industry is continuing to expand the production of new products.

    The Heecheon Machine Manufacturing Plant, which is expanding and producing at the same time, has officially started producing the latest IM-670 lathe since January this year after successfully trial-producing it. This lathe can manufacture and cut many kinds of small and medium-sized machines and accessories for heavy and light industries. At the same time, this factory has recently started mass production of various lathes, friction presses, precision oil injectors and other products, and will also produce vertical drilling machines from the second quarter. The Munchon Machinery Plant has mass-produced various pipe fittings that North Korea has not produced before. The Bukjung Machinery Plant has started producing large-scale internal combustion engines, boilers and various cranes. The Heecheon Auto Parts Factory has started producing many kinds of auto parts and rock drills.

    The machine-building industry is also vigorously supporting the restoration and development of agriculture. The output of plows, threshers, winnowers, weeding machines and other products produced by the Pyongyang Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant this year will increase by more than four times compared with last year. This factory will soon start producing new products such as new animal-powered weeding machines, power threshers, sowing machines and tractor parts.

    和平民主国家经济力量日益强大
    苏联机器制造业去年有巨大发展
    一九五四年，苏联重工业的心脏——机器制造业继续大踏步前进，许多产品的产量比一九五三年增加了。
    各个机器制造部门创造了许多新型式和新牌子的机器设备，扩大了生产自动化和机械化的范围。
    在工作母机制造方面，苏联去年创制了二百多种新型的自动和半自动的机器，它们能够加工小到直径一公厘和大到重达二三百吨的部件。奥尔忠尼启则工作母机制造工厂生产的联动车床，可以同时进行八十个到一百二十个工序，它可以代替十台车床。驰名苏联的新克拉马托尔斯克的一个机器制造厂制造了一台效力强大的轧制钢槽、钢轨和钢梁用的巨型联动机，它的重量超过九千七百吨，操作时几乎完全不需要手工劳动。
    苏联轻工业和食品工业去年从机器制造业得到许多新型的机器。单是纺织工业就得到了约五十种新式机器，主要是自动机和半自动机。苏联设计师为麻织工厂设计的一种自动织布机，效能比旧式机器增加了四倍。去年创制的一种圆形自动织布机，生产效率比普通自动织布机提高三倍。
    在去年一年中，苏联机器制造业大力支援农业的发展。今年共供应了十八万三千台拖拉机，比一九五三年得到的拖拉机多二万六千台。各机器制造工业企业和科学研究机关共设计和制造了两百多种新式农业机器。
    罗马尼亚今年农业生产的任务
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席乔治乌—德治日前在全国农业先进工作者会议上讲了话，谈到了罗马尼亚一九五五年发展农业生产的任务。
    乔治乌—德治说，一九五五年罗马尼亚对农业的投资将差不多达到二十八亿列伊（罗币名），贷给农民的款项将比去年增加三倍。今年将供给农业两千五百多台拖拉机、四千三百多部拖拉机牵引犁、一千五百多台谷物播种机，以及其他许多农业机器和农具。
    乔治乌—德治着重说，现在之所以能够以拖拉机和现代化的农业机器来装备农业，是由于人民民主政权十分重视重工业，首先是重视人民政权成立后建立起来的机器制造业。党和政府今后还将坚决遵照马克思列宁主义的原则来实行建设社会主义经济的政策，不断地发展重工业，因为它是发展整个国民经济的基础和改善劳动人民福利的泉源。
    乔治乌—德治指出，增加谷物生产是发展农业的最主要任务。在罗马尼亚农业中，玉蜀黍占着重要的地位。一九五四年春天，党和政府已经采取了一些措施来扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积，因而使播种面积比一九五三年增加了四十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），玉蜀黍的总产量超过了六百万吨。今年农业劳动者的一项特别重要的任务就是：争取各种作物丰收，主要是争取使小麦和玉蜀黍的收获量达到一千万吨，使每公顷玉蜀黍的单位面积产量至少达到两千公斤。此外，还必须十分重视增加马铃薯、甜菜、向日葵和其他农作物的产量。
    波兰农村电气化事业进展很快
    一九五四年波兰有五百九十三个乡村得到了电力供应，比一九五三年得到电力供应的乡村约多百分之四十五。此外，全国还有三百个国营农场、二百三十二个大型农业生产合作社和五十三个机器拖拉机站实行了电气化。
    波兰农村电气化进展最快的是中部和东部地区。华沙省去年有七十七个乡村得到了电力供应，卢布林省有七十个，基埃尔塞省有六十二个。
    去年波兰共架设了一千四百八十四公里长的高压电线和一千八百八十三公里长的低压电线。另外还建设了七百八十一个变电所。
    一九五五年波兰将有七百七十多个乡村、三百三十个国营农场和许多农业生产合作社电气化。
    保加利亚建设全国最大的动力工程
    保加利亚全国最大的动力工程——巴塔克水力综合工程枢纽正在大力建设中。在罗多彼山区的工地上，工人们正在热情高涨地开凿隧道，到一九五四年年底，他们已经挖通了七公里的隧道。水力综合工程枢纽的重要组成部分包括“巴塔克”、“阿列科”和“别什捷尔”等三个水电站工程。建设人员们要为这些水电站铺设地下水管，并在地面开凿水渠，以便从罗多彼山中部的大水库引来水流。
    巴塔克水力综合工程枢纽是在一九五四年下半年动工的。工地面积共达三千六百平方公里，在施工中，单是开凿的隧道就有七十八公里长，等于战前全保加利亚所凿隧道的两倍。水力综合工程枢纽的三个水电站工程建成后，发电能力共将达十六万七千瓩，等于解放前全保加利亚总发电能力的一倍半。全部工程落成后，还可以保证灌溉巴萨吉克和罗普夫迪夫两州的二十多万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）的土地。
    蒙古牧民生产合作社进一步成长
    蒙古全国各牧民生产合作社的总结工作和改选的会议已经结束了，这些会议说明了各个牧民生产合作社在组织上和经营上有了进一步成长和巩固。
    乌布汉盖区的牧民生产合作社在一九五四年获得了显著的成绩，社员人数有了大大的增加；在一年当中，牲畜的头数约增加百分之三十。作为这里农业的新部门的耕作业，也获得了进一步的发展。这个区的许多牧民生产合作社建筑了生产用房舍，开办了畜牧兽医站。
    阿拉罕格、色楞格、汉泰伊、乔巴山和其他区的牧民生产合作社也都获得了成就。
    朝鲜机器制造工厂扩大新产品的生产
    朝鲜机器制造工业正在继续扩大新产品的生产。
    一面扩建、一面生产的熙川机器制造工厂在试制最新式的IM六七○型旋床成功以后，从今年一月起已经开始正式生产这种旋床。这种旋床可以为重、轻工业部门制造和切削很多种中小机器和附件。同时，这个厂最近还开始大量生产各种旋床、摩擦压榨机、精密的注油器等产品，从第二季度起还将生产直立钻床。文川机械厂已经大量生产朝鲜没有生产过的各种铁管的配管零件。北中机械厂已开始生产大型内燃机、锅炉和各种起重机。熙川汽车零件工厂已开始生产不少种汽车零件和凿岩机。
    机器制造工业也在有力地支援着农业的恢复和发展。平壤农业机械制造所今年生产的耕犁、脱谷机、扇风机、除草机等产品的产量将比去年增加四倍以上。这个厂不久还将开始生产新式畜力除草机、动力脱谷机、播种机和拖拉机零件等新产品。
