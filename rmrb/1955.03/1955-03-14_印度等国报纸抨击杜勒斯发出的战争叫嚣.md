Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 12th: Indian newspapers have published editorials criticizing Dulles's war-mongering.

    The "Indian Express" editorial on the 11th condemned Dulles's bellicose speech on March 8th. The editorial stated that just as the people of Asia are doing their utmost to ease tensions in the region, Dulles is only exacerbating them. The editorial said that Dulles is plotting to connect the Manila Treaty Organization with military treaties signed by the United States with Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. The editorial expressed doubt as to how many members of the Manila Treaty Organization "are prepared to follow Dulles's new adventure."
    The editorial pointed out that the United States' "protection" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is threatening peace and stability in Asia. The editorial said that Dulles's aggressive threats against China are an insult to the Asian people who believe that coexistence with China is not only possible but also necessary.
      "Hindustan Standard" also published an editorial on the 11th commenting on Dulles's speech. The editorial emphasized: "If war breaks out between China and the United States over the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands, then the aggressor will not be the Chinese. Many Europeans and Asians widely share this view."
    The editorial demanded that "Asian countries that have not joined groups must firmly and clearly use their voice to avoid igniting war in Asia." The editorial also condemned the American idea that bombs and "new weapons" can defeat other countries and peoples.
      Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 12th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" commented on the 10th that honest people all despise Dulles's broadcast speech on the 8th. In this speech, Dulles peddled his intimidation tactics cheaply, and his war hysteria reached an unprecedented level.
    The newspaper said that Dulles's absurd and ridiculous attempt to portray the People's Republic of China as aggressive is nothing more than to cover up his own aggressive behavior and to find an excuse for using "new weapons" against humanity.
    The newspaper refuted Dulles's far-fetched claim that China's liberation of Taiwan is aggression, and asked, if a part of the United States' territory, such as California, were occupied by others, and if the American people rose up to take it back, would this be considered an act of aggression?
    The newspaper pointed out that Dulles may be counting on his new weapons, but the Soviet Union also has new weapons. Moreover, Dulles must face the fact that all mankind opposes his policy of strength.

    印度等国报纸抨击杜勒斯发出的战争叫嚣
    【新华社新德里十二日电】印度报纸发表社论抨击杜勒斯的战争叫嚣。
    “印度快报”十一日的社论谴责杜勒斯三月八日发表的好战演说。社论说，正当亚洲人民极力主张缓和这个地区的紧张局势的时候，杜勒斯却只是在加剧紧张局势。社论说，杜勒斯阴谋把马尼拉条约组织同美国和台湾、日本以及南朝鲜签订的军事条约连接起来。社论表示怀疑马尼拉条约组织成员国中究竟“有多少人准备追随杜勒斯的新的冒险”。
    社论指出，美国“保护”蒋介石集团一事正威胁着亚洲的和平和稳定。社论说，杜勒斯对中国的侵略威胁，就是对那些认为和中国共处不仅是可能而且是必要的亚洲人民的侮辱。
      “印度斯坦旗报”也在十一日发表社论，评论杜勒斯的演说。社论强调指出：“如果中国和美国由于台湾和沿海岛屿的问题发生战争的话，那么侵略者将不是中国人。许多欧洲人以及亚洲人都广泛地抱有这种看法。”
    社论要求“没有参加集团的亚洲国家必须坚定地和明确地利用它们的发言权，来避免在亚洲燃起战火”。社论还斥责了美国认为用炸弹和“新武器”就能够战胜其他国家和人民的想法。
      【新华社雅加达十二日电】印度尼西亚“人民日报”十日评论说，正直的人们都唾弃杜勒斯在八日发表的广播演说，杜勒斯在这次演说中廉价兜售他的恫吓手段，他的战争歇斯底里叫嚣达到空前的热度。
    这家报纸说，杜勒斯荒谬可笑地企图把中华人民共和国说成是侵略性的，这不过是为了掩盖他自己的侵略行为，并且为对人类使用“新武器”寻找借口。
    这家报纸驳斥杜勒斯提出的硬说中国解放台湾是侵略的强词夺理的说法，报纸问道，如果美国的一部分领土如像加利福尼亚州被别人侵占了，如果美国人民起来把它夺回来，这算是侵略行为吗？
    这家报纸指出，杜勒斯可能在指望他的新武器，但是苏联也有新武器。而且，杜勒斯必须正视的事实是全人类都反对他的实力政策。
