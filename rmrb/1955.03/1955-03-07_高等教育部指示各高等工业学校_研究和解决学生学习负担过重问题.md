    The Ministry of Higher Education Instructs All Higher Industrial Schools
    to Study and Solve the Problem of Students' Excessive Study Load
    The Ministry of Higher Education issued instructions on the 4th regarding the study and resolution of the problem of excessive study load on students in higher industrial schools.
    The instructions stated: In the first semester of the 1954-1955 academic year, higher industrial schools across the country achieved considerable success in teaching reform, but the phenomenon of excessive study load on students, to varying degrees, occurred quite commonly in all schools. The majority of students spent more than 60 hours per week on study inside and outside of class, and some students even reached more than 70 hours, which affected students' physical health, hindered their concern for and study of current affairs and politics, and also affected teaching effectiveness. The instructions require all teachers to recognize that: learning from the Soviet Union must be combined with China's actual situation, steadily improve teaching quality, and implement the education policy of all-round development. The principle of "learn less, learn better" must be implemented in the formulation of teaching documents and in the concrete conduct of teaching work. Deans and department administrations must strengthen specific guidance and regular inspection and supervision of the work of teaching and research groups. Relevant teaching and research groups must cooperate and coordinate closely, and conduct regular and serious research on the current teaching situation and teaching methods to overcome the phenomenon of repetition and disconnection in teaching content. It is of particular importance for the leaders of the teaching and research groups in each school to actively carry out teaching method work and continuously improve teaching standards. Academic affairs offices and department administrations should pay special attention to summarizing good teaching experiences and promptly exchange and promote them to quickly improve teachers' teaching standards.
    The instructions stipulate that all higher industrial schools must implement a unified teaching plan, but attention should be paid to combining it with the specific conditions of the school. If there are indeed difficulties that are temporarily difficult to overcome and work cannot be arranged according to the unified teaching plan, a plan for gradual achievement should be made in a realistic manner. Teaching plans in each school that have not been approved should be reviewed and revised again in accordance with the education policy of all-round development and combined with China's actual conditions. In the implementation of unified teaching syllabuses or in the formulation of new teaching syllabuses, each school must pay attention to implementing the principle of "learn less, learn better." The instructions also stipulate that from the second semester of this academic year, students who have difficulty learning professional knowledge may be exempted from Russian language study with the approval of the school or dean. Some schools, departments, or majors, if the implementation of the unified teaching plan is very difficult and the Russian language teaching staff is very poor, may not offer Russian language courses or change Russian language courses to electives. Students who failed the semester exams in the previous semester, even if they failed more than four courses, should be given the opportunity to take make-up exams with reference to their usual grades, and their tutoring should be strengthened before the make-up exams, and the requirements for the exams should also be made to conform to the actual teaching situation.
    The instructions require all schools to pay special attention to the study of worker-peasant cadre students and strengthen their extracurricular tutoring. If there are a large number of worker-peasant students in the same grade in certain majors, they should be assigned to separate classes so that they can be systematically helped to make up for their studies and gradually learn professional knowledge well.
    The instructions also touched upon the issue of improving the organization of teaching work and students' self-study work plans and arrangements. In teaching, the principle of "rather teach less, but enable students to deeply study and consolidate the main chapters and principles of the courses they have learned" must be implemented. The amount and content of students' extracurricular self-study work should be planned to ensure the balanced progress of learning throughout the semester. The total number of hours students study per week should be controlled at 54 hours. (Xinhua News Agency)

    高等教育部指示各高等工业学校
    研究和解决学生学习负担过重问题
    高等教育部四日发出关于研究和解决高等工业学校学生学习负担过重问题的指示。
    指示说：一九五四—一九五五学年第一学期，全国高等工业学校在教学改革方面获得了相当大的成就，但是各校相当普遍地发生了程度不同的学生学习负担过重的现象。多数学生每周课内外学习时间超过六十小时以上，还有些学生竟达七十小时以上，因而影响了学生的身体健康，妨碍了学生对时事政治的关心和学习，而且也影响了教学效果。指示要求全体教师认识：学习苏联必须与中国实际相结合，稳步提高教学质量，贯彻全面发展的教育方针。在制定教学文件和具体进行教学工作中必须贯彻“学少一点，学好一点”的原则。教务长和系行政必须加强对教研组工作的具体指导和经常检查监督。各有关教研组必须协同合作，密切配合，对目前教学情况及教学法工作等经常认真研究，克服教学内容重复和脱节的现象。各校教研组领导全体成员积极开展教学法工作，不断提高教学水平，具有特别重要的意义。教务处和系行政应特别注意总结好的教学经验，及时交流推广，以迅速提高教师的教学水平。
    指示规定各高等工业学校必须执行统一的教学计划，但执行时应注意结合本校具体条件，如确有暂时难以克服的困难，不能按统一教学计划安排工作的，就应实事求是地作出逐步达到的计划。各校没有经过批准的教学计划，应根据全面发展的教育方针，结合中国实际条件，重新加以审查修订。各校在执行统一教学大纲或在拟订新的教学大纲时，必须注意贯彻“学少一点，学好一点”的原则。指示还规定从本学年第二学期起，对于学习专业知识有困难的学生，经校、院长批准，可以免修俄文。有些学校、系科或专业，如果执行统一教学计划困难很大，而且俄文师资条件很差的，可以不设俄文课或将俄文课改为选修。对于上学期学期考试不及格的学生，即使不及格的课程超过四门，也应参照平时成绩，给予补考机会，并于补考前加强对他们的辅导，对考试的要求也应力求符合教学实际情况。
    指示要求各校应特别关心工农干部学生的学习，注意加强对他们的课外辅导。某些专业如果同年级的工农学生较多，应单独编班上课，以便有计划地帮助他们重点补习，逐步学好专业知识。
    指示还谈到了改进教学工作组织和学生自学工作计划和安排问题。教学中必须贯彻“宁肯少教一些，但要使学生对所学课程的主要章节与原则性的问题能够深入学习和巩固地掌握起来”的原则。对学生课外自学工作的分量和内容加以计划化，来保证整个学期学习的均衡进行。并将学生每周学习总时数控制在五十四小时。　（新华社）
