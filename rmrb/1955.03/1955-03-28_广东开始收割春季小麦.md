Guangdong Begins Harvesting Spring Wheat

The spring-harvested wheat in various parts of Guangdong, with a planting area of over 2.9 million mu (an increase of 900,000 mu compared to last year), is mostly growing well. The early-maturing crops have begun to be harvested, and the general crops have reached the milk stage.

According to the situation in the areas where harvesting has begun, wheat production will increase compared to last year. The Chenqiao Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chao'an County harvested 20 mu, with the highest yield reaching over 360 jin per mu, and the general yield reaching 200 jin; while last year the highest was 200 jin, and the general was 100 jin. Eight agricultural production cooperatives in Meigang Township, Sixth District of Xinhui County, began harvesting on March 7th, with the best yield reaching 300 jin per mu, and the general yield reaching 120 jin.

Wheat in most areas of the province is estimated to have a good harvest. In Xinyi County, Western Guangdong, the yield of over 88,000 mu of wheat is mostly expected to exceed 140 jin per mu. In Yangjiang County, the well-grown wheat can yield 180 jin, and the general yield is about 150 jin. It is estimated that most of the 400,000 mu of wheat in Central Guangdong will have increased production. According to field conditions, it is estimated that 40% of the 19,000 mu in Xinhui County can yield about 160 jin. The wheat in Northern and Eastern Guangdong is also growing very well.

    广东开始收割春季小麦
    广东各地播种面积达二百九十多万亩（比去年增加了九十万亩）的春收小麦，大部分生长良好，早熟的已开始收割，一般的也已含浆结实。
    据已开割地区的情况来看，小麦将比去年增产。潮安县陈桥乡农牧业生产合作社收割了二十亩，每亩最高产量达三百六十多斤，一般的也有二百斤；而去年最高的是二百斤，一般的是一百斤。新会县第六区梅冈乡八个农业生产合作社在三月七日开始收割，最好的每亩产量达三百斤，一般的也有一百二十斤。
    全省大部分地区的小麦估计都有好的收成。粤西区信宜县八万八千多亩小麦大都每亩可收一百四十斤以上。阳江县的小麦生长得好的可收一百八十斤，一般的可收一百五十斤左右。粤中区四十多万亩小麦，估计大部分可获增产。新会县的一万九千亩，根据田面情况推算，估计有百分之四十可收获一百六十斤左右。粤北区和粤东区的小麦也生长得很好。
