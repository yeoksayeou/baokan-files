    Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: Jakarta News: Indonesian President Sukarno, in a speech to a mass rally in Malang, East Java, on the 2nd, expressed his optimism about the outcome of the upcoming Asian-African Conference.

    In his speech, President Sukarno pointed out that the countries participating in the Asian-African Conference have differences in status and opinions, but they also have common ground. Asian and African countries are rising up to liberate themselves from the shackles of colonialism. He said that because the Asian-African Conference will discuss the issue of colonialism, he is optimistic about the outcome of the conference.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 4th: Indonesia's "Independent Daily" commented on the 3rd on the Western countries' conspiracy to pull Indonesia into the Manila Treaty Organization, saying that the West's attempt to entice Indonesia to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is because, without the participation of Indonesia and other Asian countries, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has no significant political meaning. This organization is nothing more than a Western countries' organization without the support of the people of Asian countries.

    The commentary said that Indonesia has never considered joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, despite the huge economic aid offered as bait. The Manila Treaty Organization will only exacerbate tensions and increase the difficulty of efforts to maintain peace in Asia, which is the common desire of Indonesia and other Asian peoples.

    The commentary said that in this situation, Western countries cling tightly to figures like Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Bao Dai, whose regimes would not exist without Western military assistance.

    苏加诺总统对亚非会议前途表示乐观
    印度尼西亚报纸反对西方国家拼凑军事集团的阴谋
    【新华社四日讯】　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚总统苏加诺二日在爪哇东部玛琅州的群众大会上发表演说时表示，他对即将召开的亚非会议的结果是乐观的。
    苏加诺总统在演说中指出，参加亚非会议的各国，在地位上、见解上是有分歧的，但它们有共同之处。亚洲和非洲的国家正在站起来自殖民主义桎梏下解放它们自己。他说，由于亚非会议将讨论殖民主义问题，因此，他对会议的结果是乐观的。
    【新华社雅加达四日电】　印度尼西亚“独立报”三日评论西方国家企图把印度尼西亚拉入马尼拉条约集团的阴谋说，西方所以企图引诱印度尼西亚加入东南亚条约组织，是因为如果没有印度尼西亚和其他亚洲国家的参加，东南亚条约组织是没有重大的政治意义的。这个组织不过是一个没有亚洲各国人民支持的西方国家的组织。
    评论说，印度尼西亚从来没有考虑过参加东南亚条约组织，尽管曾对它提出了巨大的经济援助作为钓饵。马尼拉条约组织将只能加剧紧张局势和增加维护亚洲和平的努力的困难，而维护亚洲和平是印度尼西亚和其他亚洲人民的共同愿望。
    评论说，在这种情况下，西方国家就紧紧地抓住蒋介石、李承晚、保大之流，而这些人的政权如果没有西方的军事援助早就不存在了。
