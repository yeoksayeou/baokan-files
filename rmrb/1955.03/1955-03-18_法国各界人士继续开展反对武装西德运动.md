Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 17th: The movement of people from all walks of life in France against the revival of German militarism is continuing to develop.

    The newly established "New Left Federation," composed of some political groups and political activists, firmly opposes the remilitarization of West Germany. At the conference held by the "New Left Federation" in Paris on the 15th, Paul Fraisse, editor of "Libération," René Capitant, leader of the "Democratic Labor Union," Bounès, member of the "Progressive Republican Alliance," Claude Bourdet, editor of the weekly "France Observateur," and Louis Vallon, member of the National Assembly, all spoke against the ratification of the Paris Agreements, demanding the restoration of France's independence and the implementation of an independent foreign policy.

    Former Minister René Capitant said, "If the Paris Agreements are ratified, an armed West Germany will appear on our border. We will feel even more the pressure from the United States in North Africa, and we will lose even more of our independence in political, diplomatic, and military affairs." Assembly member Louis Vallon, in his speech, called for maintaining the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on December 10, 1944.

    French representatives who participated in the Warsaw Conference of European Countries Against Arming West Germany in February emphasized at a rally held in Paris on the 14th that they opposed the rearmament of West Germany and advocated immediate negotiations on the peaceful unification of Germany. One of the representatives, Senator Debû-Bridel of the French Republic, said, "Once France plays the role of accomplice in arming Germany, it will lose the prestige of a major power." Another representative, Étienne Noveau, Vice-President of the French Veterans Federation, which has three million members, emphasized that agreeing to arm West Germany is a policy leading to suicide, and he believes that it is necessary to resist the pressure from the United States to make the French Parliament ratify the Paris Agreements.

    French intellectuals are also actively participating in the current struggle. Representatives of French university professors and teachers held a meeting in Paris on the 13th with representatives of professors and teachers from West German universities to discuss strengthening the joint struggle against arming West Germany. Representatives of the French National Association of Engineers and Technicians also recently held a meeting in Berlin with representatives of the Engineering Association of the German Democratic Republic to formulate a program for launching a joint struggle against the Paris Agreements.

    法国各界人士继续开展反对武装西德运动
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国各阶层人民反对复活德国军国主义的运动正在继续发展。
    新近成立的由一些政治团体和政治活动家参加的“新左派联合会”坚决反对使西德重新军国主义化。在“新左派联合会”十五日在巴黎举行的大会上，“灵报”编辑保罗·弗雷兹、“民主劳工联盟”的领导人雷纳·加比唐、“进步共和联盟”的盟员布内、“法兰西观察家”周刊编辑克劳德·布尔戴、国民议会议员路易·伐隆等人都发言反对批准巴黎协定，要求恢复法国的独立和实行独立的外交政策。
    前部长雷纳·加比唐说，“如果巴黎协定被批准，武装起来的西德将在我国边境上出现。我们将会更加感觉到美国在北非的压力，我们并且要在更大程度上丧失我们在政治、外交和军事方面的独立性。”议员路易·伐隆在讲话中要求保持一九四四年十二月十日签订的法苏同盟互助条约。
    参加二月间欧洲国家反对武装西德的华沙会议的法国代表们十四日在巴黎举行的一次集会上强调反对重新武装西德，主张立刻举行关于和平统一德国的谈判。代表之一，共和国参议院议员德博—布里德说，“一旦法国充当武装德国的同谋者的角色，它就会丧失大国的威望。”另一个代表，拥有三百万会员的法兰西退伍军人联盟的副主席埃蒂安·诺沃强调指出，同意武装西德是导向自杀的政策，他认为必须抵抗来自美国的企图使法国议会批准巴黎协定的压力。
    法国知识分子也积极参加当前的斗争。法国大学教授和教师的代表十三日在巴黎同西德各大学的教授和教师的代表举行会议，讨论加强反对武装西德的联合斗争问题。法国工程师和技师全国协会代表最近也和德意志民主共和国工程协会代表在柏林举行会议，拟定了展开反对巴黎协定的联合斗争的纲领。
