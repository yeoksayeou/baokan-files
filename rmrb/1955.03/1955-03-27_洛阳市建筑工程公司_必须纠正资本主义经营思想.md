To the Editor:

The capitalist management ideologies of certain leading cadres of the Luoyang City Construction Engineering Company have reached a very serious stage.

In June 1954, when they were contracted to build the Xiaoyi Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory, they haggled over the amount of profit, which hindered the timely signing of the construction contract. After the start of construction, they frequently made unreasonable demands in an attempt to achieve the purpose of profiteering. For the two kiln projects, they estimated that they could make money, so they contracted them in one go; for the two large chimney projects, which were fifty-three and forty-five meters high, they were afraid of not making money, so they demanded reimbursement for actual expenses. Based on the soil thickness near the Xiaoyi Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory, it was estimated that the factory site would have to be relocated in a few decades. Therefore, some of the construction materials could be obtained locally, without the need to purchase them from other places. However, the Luoyang City Construction Engineering Company clearly used materials from near Xiaoyi, but used the prices of materials from Zhengzhou and Luoyang as the calculation unit price to overcharge the client. When these unreasonable demands were not met, they even threatened to "stop work."

When the project was basically completed and final accounts were being settled, they used despicable means such as raising the unit price of engineering materials on the project final account, reporting the quantity of incoming materials as less than the actual amount, fabricating something from nothing, arbitrarily adding transportation and miscellaneous fees, and creating false accounts in an attempt to achieve the purpose of profiteering. The actual number of special bricks brought into the site was 437,815, but the account recorded 448,065; a bill of one million blue bricks was over-reported by 326.3 million old yuan by increasing the average unit price. They even included the freight for fine sand transported to other construction sites in the Xiaoyi Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory project. There are many such facts of false accounting, totaling more than 498 million old yuan, accounting for more than 4 percent of the total value of the contracted project.

They had similar situations when undertaking other projects.

Certain leading cadres of the Luoyang City Construction Engineering Company must seriously examine this profit-seeking capitalist ideology.

### 洛阳市建筑工程公司  必须纠正资本主义经营思想

    洛阳市建筑工程公司
    必须纠正资本主义经营思想编辑同志：
    洛阳市建筑工程公司的某些领导干部的资本主义经营思想已经到了十分严重的地步。
    一九五四年六月他们在承建孝义机制砖瓦厂时，斤斤计较赚钱的多少，妨碍了及时订立施工合同。开工以后，他们经常提出无理要求，企图达到牟取暴利的目的。两座大窑工程，估计能赚钱，他们便一口包下来；有两座高达五十三和四十五公尺的大烟囱工程，他们恐怕赚不到钱，就要求实报实销。根据孝义机制砖瓦厂附近的土质厚度，预计在几十年后必须迁移厂址，因此一部分建厂材料可以就地取材，不必到外地采购。可是洛阳市建筑工程公司明明是采用的孝义附近的材料，却以郑州和洛阳的材料价格作为计算单价向甲方多要钱。当这类无理的要求得不到满足的时候，竟用“停工”相威胁。
    当工程基本上竣工已在办理工程决算的时候，他们竟在工程决算单上采取提高工程材料单价，把进场材料的数量以少报多，以无作有，乱加运费、杂费和造假账等卑劣手段，企图达到牟取暴利的目的。特制砖进场实际数为四十三万七千八百一十五块，账上却记着四十四万八千零六十五块；一笔一百万块青砖的账用提高平均单价的办法多报了旧币三亿二千六百三十多万元。他们甚至把运到别的工地的细砂运费也算到孝义机制砖瓦厂的工程内。这类虚报账目的事实很多，共达旧币四亿九千八百多万元，占全部承包工程总值的百分之四强。
    他们在承建其他工程时，也有类似情况。
    洛阳市建筑工程公司某些领导干部必须严肃地检查一下这种唯利是图的资本主义思想。
