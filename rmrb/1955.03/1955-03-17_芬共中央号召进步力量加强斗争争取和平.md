Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, March 15th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party held a plenary meeting in Helsinki on the 12th and 13th of March. The meeting discussed the report by Finnish Communist Party Chairman Aalto on the political situation and the struggle for peace.

The plenary meeting adopted a resolution, which pointed out: American aggressive actions in Asia and its accelerated rearmament of West Germany are worsening the international situation. Reactionary forces are carrying out war propaganda, which is also affecting Finland. Pressure is now being exerted on Finland to force it to abandon its peaceful policy, and to force Finland to serve the purposes of the warmongers through the Scandinavian countries that have signed the North Atlantic Treaty.

The resolution calls on progressive forces to strengthen the struggle for peace and against the remilitarization of West Germany, and to be vigilant.

The resolution calls on every Finnish Communist Party member to actively participate in the signature campaign for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World." The resolution points out: It is necessary to take action so that our people can no longer suffer disasters again and live in a peaceful environment.
