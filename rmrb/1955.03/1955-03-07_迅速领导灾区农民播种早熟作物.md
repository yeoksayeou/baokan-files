Promptly Lead Farmers in Disaster Areas to Sow Early-Maturing Crops
Zhao Qi

Planting early-maturing crops is a good way to solve the food problem in disaster-stricken areas. Spring wheat, spring barley, spring peas, and early-maturing varieties of corn, millet, sorghum, potatoes, and melons and vegetables planted in the spring can generally mature in June and July. In Hebei Province, for example, the Xiao Huantui corn and Xiao Chun millet planted in the central Hebei area can generally mature in mid-to-late June. These crops mature about two months earlier than the major autumn crops, so they play a significant role in providing food to farmers in disaster areas.

To lead farmers in disaster areas to rush to plant early-maturing crops, we must solve the specific difficulties of the masses. Some farmers in disaster areas lack the habit of planting early-maturing crops; others, although they have the habit, lack seeds. For seed-deficient areas, the problem of seed shortage should be solved through allocation and supply or by organizing the masses to exchange seeds. In areas where there is no planting habit, in addition to solving the problem of seed shortage, we must also do a good job in imparting planting techniques. At the same time, we must also do a good job in ideological mobilization to make farmers in disaster areas truly realize the important role of planting early-maturing crops in surviving the famine.

To lead farmers in disaster areas to rush to plant early-maturing crops, we must seize the time. The sowing period for early-maturing crops is generally in early March in Anhui and northern Jiangsu; in some areas of Hebei and Shandong, it is generally from mid-March to early April. The suitable time for sowing early-maturing crops is very short, and a slight relaxation will delay the sowing period.

    迅速领导灾区农民播种早熟作物
    赵起
    种植早熟作物，是受灾地区解决口粮问题的一个好办法。春小麦、春大麦、春豌豆和春季种的早熟品种的玉米、谷子、黍子、马铃薯以及瓜菜等，一般能在六、七月成熟。就河北省来说，冀中一带种植的小獾腿玉米、小春谷，一般在六月中、下旬可以成熟；这些作物比大秋作物约提前两个月成熟，因此对接济灾区农民口粮所起的作用是很大的。
    领导灾区农民抢种早熟作物，必须解决群众的具体困难。有些灾区农民缺乏种植早熟作物的习惯；有些灾区农民虽有种植习惯，但缺乏种籽。对缺种地区，应通过调拨供应或组织群众互通有无的串借，解决缺种问题。对过去没有种植习惯的地区，除了解决缺种问题外，还要做好传授种植技术的工作。同时还必须做好思想动员工作，使灾区农民切实认识到种早熟作物对度荒的重要作用。
    领导灾区农民抢种早熟作物必须抓紧时间进行。早熟作物的播种期，在安徽和江苏北部一般是三月上旬；在河北、山东的一些地区一般是三月中到四月初。播种早熟作物的适宜时间是很短的，稍一放松就会耽误了播种期。
