    Supplying Disaster Area Farmers with Production Materials
    The supply and marketing cooperatives in the four disaster-stricken counties of Honghu, Mianyang, Hanyang, and Echeng in Hubei Province are actively supplying farmers with spring plowing production materials. The Honghu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative processed 1,100 old plows in January and organized seven blacksmith furnaces and ten carpentry teams to go to the countryside to help farmers repair agricultural implements. Before formulating a production materials supply plan, the Hanyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative investigated the needs of the masses for production materials in a severely affected township. Based on the needs of the masses, they have prepared a batch of cake fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and 30,000 jin of pig bristles and other miscellaneous fertilizers. The Echeng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also signed contracts with private hatcheries to organize the incubation of one million chicks and 300,000 ducklings to support disaster victims in restoring sideline production. A large number of production materials have now been successively supplied to farmers in the disaster areas. (Our reporter in Wuhan)

    供应灾区农民生产资料
    湖北省洪湖、沔阳、汉阳、鄂城四个受灾县的供销合作社，积极供应农民春耕生产资料。洪湖县供销合作社在一月份就组织加工了一千一百张旧犁，还组织了七付铁匠炉、十个木工组下乡帮助农民修理农具。汉阳县供销合作社在制订生产资料供应计划以前，曾经在一个重灾乡调查了群众需要生产资料的情况。他们根据群众的需要，已经准备了一批饼肥、化学肥料和三万斤猪毛等杂肥。鄂城县供销合作社还同私营孵房签订合同，组织孵育一百万只小鸡和三十万只小鸭，支援灾民恢复副业生产。现在，大批生产资料已经陆续供应到灾区农民手中。　（本报记者武汉讯）
