    Learn to Manage Household Affairs

    Commercial workers control a large amount of the nation's financial and material resources. A slight mistake of subjectivism can cause considerable losses to the country and the people.
    The comrades at the Tiexi Store in Shenyang heard that a certain printing factory needed imported tissue paper, so they purchased 219,000 sheets from places like Panshi and Benxi. As a result, the specifications were not suitable, and the factory did not buy them. Another store's purchasing agent, when out purchasing, saw that Venus pencils and Dashao pen nibs were very good and thought they would "definitely sell well," so they bought 43,200 Dashao nibs and 25,920 Venus pencils. After the purchase, they have not been sold to this day. The Shenyang United Company, due to the purchasing agents arbitrarily modifying plans and acting on their own, recklessly procured goods, resulting in the backlog of 98 kinds of goods, worth 364,000 yuan. The Shenyang Department Store accumulated a large number of canned goods, of which 120,000 cans were purchased when the director of the food wholesale department's business office was in Guangzhou to urge the allocation of brown sugar, and arbitrarily signed a contract with the Shantou Cannery to purchase goods. Zheng Benliang, deputy manager of the Anshan Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, heard that Anshan Iron and Steel wanted to buy cars, and without further inquiry, telegraphed the purchasing agent in Guangzhou to purchase ten Czechoslovakian-made ten-ton tipper trucks. After they were transported back, it was discovered that Anshan Iron and Steel did not want them, so they were backlogged in the warehouse. The interest paid to the bank has now reached more than 50,000 yuan.
    A considerable part of the waste in commerce is caused by not studying market conditions and actual needs, but only relying on estimates and blindly organizing procurement.
    Perhaps some people will say: "What can be done? Everyone has no experience!" This kind of excuse cannot stand refutation. If it is really a lack of experience, then we should humbly learn, use our brains more to make careful arrangements, and do our work more cautiously. Do you want to purchase the materials needed by a certain agency? You may as well visit the users. If these things are not done, but only a moment of enthusiasm and acting on one's own, this cannot be attributed to "lack of experience," but should be examined subjectively from one's own thinking and national concept.
    In 1921, Lenin mentioned in his article "The Fourth Anniversary of the October Revolution": "The proletarian state should become a cautious, diligent, and good at managing household affairs 'householder,' a shrewd and experienced wholesale merchant." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume set) In his political report of the Central Committee to the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on March 27, 1922, he asked Communist Party members to "learn from those ordinary shop assistants who have been squatting in the grain business for ten years and are familiar with this field." He pointed out: "What is lacking is obvious: it is that the part of the Communist Party members who are engaged in management lack cultural talent." Today, we have the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's socialist management of commerce to learn from, which is much better than the conditions in Russia at that time. Now, everything depends on our subjective efforts. We should cherish every penny of the country, be cautious, diligent, and good at managing household affairs. We should learn more from all kinds of experienced people.

    商业工作人员掌握着国家大量的财力物力，稍一犯主观主义的毛病，就会给国家和人民带来不少损失。
    沈阳铁西商店的同志听说某印刷厂需要进口薄页纸，就由磐石、本溪等地购进了二十一万九千张；结果规格不合，工厂不买。另一商店的采购员出外采购时，看到维纳斯铅笔和大勺钢笔尖很不错，认为“一定好销”，于是买了四万三千二百个大勺笔尖，二万五千九百二十支维纳斯铅笔，购进后，到如今也没卖出。沈阳联营公司由于采购员随便修改计划，自作主张，滥行采购，就造成九十八种商品积压，价值三十六万四千元。沈阳百货公司积压了大批罐头，其中有十二万听是食品批发部营业室主任到广州催拨红糖，路过汕头罐头厂时擅自与该厂签定合同进货的。鞍山市交通电工器材公司副经理郑本良听说鞍钢要买汽车，也没有再打听一下，就电告驻广州的采购员购进捷克斯洛伐克造的十吨翻斗汽车十辆，运到后才发现鞍钢不要，只得积压在仓库内，如今给银行付出的利息已达五万多元。
    商业上的浪费，其中有相当多的一部分，就是由于不研究市场情况和实际需要，只凭估计，盲目组织进货所造成的。
    也许有人说：“有什么办法呢？大家没有经验啊！”这种借口是经不起反驳的。如果真是没有经验，那就应该虚心学习，更多用脑筋去作周密的安排，更谨慎地做好自己的工作。你要采购某机关所需要的物资吗？不妨登门拜访一下用户。如果这些事不去做，只是脑子一热，自作主张，这就不能推到“没有经验”，而应该从主观上检查自己的思想和国家观念。
    一九二一年列宁在“十月革命四周年”一文中提到：“无产阶级国家应当成为一个谨慎、勤勉、善操家政的‘家主’，成为一个精明练达的批发商人。”（“列宁文选”两卷集）他在一九二二年三月二十七日俄国共产党（布）第十一次代表大会上中央委员会底政治报告中，要求共产党员“向那些在粮食行里蹲了十年并熟悉这门的普通店员学习”。他指出：“所缺乏的东西，是显而易见的：就是从事管理的那部分共产党员缺乏文化材干。”我们今天有苏联社会主义管理商业的先进经验可以学习，比当时的俄国条件要好得多。现在，一切都决定于我们主观的努力。应当珍惜国家的每一文钱，要谨慎、勤勉、善操家政。要多向各种有经验的人学习。
