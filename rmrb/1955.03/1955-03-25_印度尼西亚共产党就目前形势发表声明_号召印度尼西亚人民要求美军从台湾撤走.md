Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 24th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published a statement by the Indonesian Communist Party on the current situation on the 23rd.

The statement said that the United States' aggression against China's territory of Taiwan not only endangers the People's Republic of China, but also endangers the whole of Asia, including Indonesia. The United States' occupation of Taiwan and its collusion with Chiang Kai-shek is the root cause of the tense situation in Asia.

The statement pointed out that the subversive activities of the Chiang Kai-shek elements in Indonesia are seriously damaging Indonesia's economic, political, and social life. They have become an international spy agency under the command of the United States.

The statement called on the Indonesian people to demand that the United States armed forces withdraw from Taiwan, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and demand that the United Nations recognize the People's Republic of China as the only official representative of the Chinese people.

The statement also called on the Indonesian government to continue its efforts to suppress the anti-Indonesian activities of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, and to continue its efforts within and outside the United Nations to drive the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from Taiwan and the United Nations, and to withdraw the US troops from Taiwan and other islands and the Taiwan Strait.
