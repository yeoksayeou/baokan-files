    Active Extracurricular Research in Wuhan University's Chinese Department
    With the start of the new semester, the extracurricular research of third- and fourth-year students in the Chinese Department of Wuhan University has become active. Students are using their spare time each day to read various literary works and reference materials. Some are busy collecting materials, preparing to collectively write papers, and submit them for discussion in research groups.
    In the two weeks since the start of the semester at Wuhan University, Chinese Department students have already established diverse research groups, including "Dream of the Red Chamber," "The Scholars," "Poetry and Folk Songs," "Classical Literature," and "Foreign Literature." Students participating in the "Poetry and Folk Songs Research Group" have decided to study "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" in order to explore the issue of national forms. The "Foreign Literature Research Group" has decided to study "Dead Souls." Students participating in the "Dream of the Red Chamber Research Group" have also separately determined their research topics. Currently, teachers have assigned reference books to students participating in these research groups. These reference books not only include various related literary works, but also the writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on literary and artistic issues, and Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.

    武汉大学中文系课余研究活跃
    随着新学期的开始，武汉大学中文系三、四年级学生的课余研究开始活跃了。学生们正利用每天的空隙时间阅读着各种文学作品和参考文件。他们有的忙着搜集材料，准备集体撰写论文，交研究小组讨论。
    这学期武汉大学开学只两个多星期，中文系学生们就第一次建立起“红楼梦”、“儒林外史”、“诗歌与民谣”、“古典文学”和“外国文学”等多种多样的研究小组。参加“诗歌与民谣研究小组”的学生为着探讨民族形式问题，已确定研究
  “王贵与李香香”。“外国文学研究小组”已决定研究“死魂灵”。参加“红楼梦研究小组”的学生们也分别确定了研究专题。目前，教师们已给参加这些研究小组的学生们指定了参考书籍。这些参考书籍不仅有各种有关的文艺作品，而且有马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于文艺问题的言论和毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话等。　（新华社）
