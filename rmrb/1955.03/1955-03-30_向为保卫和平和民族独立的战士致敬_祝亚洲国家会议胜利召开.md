    Saluting the Warriors Defending Peace and National Independence
    ——Congratulating the Victorious Opening of the Asian Countries Conference
    Saifuddin, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China

    The Asian Countries Conference, initiated by social figures from various Asian countries, will be held in New Delhi, the capital of India, from April 6th to 10th. This conference will undoubtedly further promote the friendship and unity among the approximately 1.4 billion peace-loving people of Asia in the cause of defending peace. I warmly congratulate the victorious opening of this significant conference.

    More and more people now recognize that, in order to strive for democratic rights and national independence, and to establish a truly peaceful life, peace has become a common aspiration and a sacred task of struggle for mankind today. The increasing threat to peace by the belligerent elements headed by US imperialism precisely tells the people of all countries that they must further advance the struggle for the cause of peace. Indeed, it is precisely so: the more insane the belligerent elements are, the more they are met with the resentment and opposition of peace-loving people.

    Peace is especially important for the long-oppressed people of Asia. We Asian people see that US imperialism is increasingly unreasonably interfering in the internal affairs of various countries in this region, undermining the peaceful life of the people of various countries, organizing the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" to split Asian countries, and in particular, openly obstructing our just struggle to liberate Taiwan, signing the US-Chiang Kai-shek mutual defense treaty in order to expand its aggression against our country and prepare to launch a new war. These heinous acts of aggression are intolerable and resolutely opposed by the peace-loving people of Asia.

    The Asian Countries Conference will not only further promote peaceful coexistence and friendly and united relations between Asian countries with different systems, but will also undoubtedly play an important role in promoting economic, cultural, and mutual cooperation among Asian countries. Our 600 million people of China are joining the people of Asia and the world in a common struggle for peace, democracy, and the independence and freedom of our motherland. Our people not only demand peace, but also resolutely defend peace, and fight to the end for the victory of peace. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, we are united and confidently advancing bravely towards great socialism. We will never allow any acts of aggression that plot to destroy our happy life today and tomorrow, and to destroy the peace of Asia and the world!

    We Chinese people attach great importance to the friendly relations between the people of Asian countries. The Chinese people are convinced that all countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and develop friendly relations in a peaceful environment. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India, China and Burma, and the facts of the friendly relations developed between our country and these countries over the past year, are proof of this.

    Historical experience points out that the just demands of mankind cannot be prevented or obliterated by any dark forces, and the people's struggle will surely achieve victory. Any actions and conspiracies that attempt to "obstruct" the development of human society and "cancel" the common aspirations of mankind will inevitably reap the consequences and head for self-destruction. We want to tell those imperialist elements who pursue a policy of aggression, disregarding the lofty aspirations and will of the people of the world who are fighting for peace, democracy, and national independence, that if they dare to launch a war, they will never escape the same fate as those human criminals in history who were annihilated by the power of the people.

    Let us salute all the warriors defending peace and national independence!
    Respectfully wishing the Asian Countries Conference a victorious opening.

    向为保卫和平和民族独立的战士致敬
    ——祝亚洲国家会议胜利召开
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长  赛福鼎
    由亚洲各国社会人士所发起的亚洲国家会议，将于四月六日至十日在印度首都新德里召开。这个会议必将进一步促进亚洲约十四亿的爱好和平人民之间为保卫和平事业的友好和团结。我热烈祝贺这个重大的会议胜利召开。
    现在愈来愈多的人认识到：为了争取民主权利和民族独立，为了建立真正安宁的生活，和平在今日已成为人类共同的愿望和神圣的斗争任务。以美帝国主义为首的好战分子对和平日益增加的威胁，正是告诉各国人民必须要更加推进为和平事业的斗争。事实也正是如此：好战分子愈疯狂，它就愈遭到爱好和平的人民的愤恨和反对。
    和平对于长期遭受压迫的亚洲人民尤其重要。我们亚洲人民看到美帝国主义在这个地区愈来愈无理地干涉各国的内政，破坏各国人民的和平生活，组织分裂亚洲国家的所谓“东南亚防御集团”，特别是公然阻挠我解放台湾的正义斗争，签订美蒋共同防御条约，以便扩大对我国的侵略和准备发动新战争。这些罪恶的侵略行为是亚洲爱好和平的人民不能容忍和坚决反对的。
    亚洲国家会议，不仅必将更加促进亚洲不同制度的各国之间的和平共处和友好团结的关系，而且对于促进亚洲各国的经济、文化和相互间的合作无疑的也将起重要作用。我们全中国六亿人民正在与亚洲、全世界人民一道，共同为和平、民主和祖国的独立自由而进行斗争。我国人民不仅是要求和平，而且坚决保卫和平，为和平的胜利而斗争到底。我们在中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东的领导下，团结一致，满怀信心地向着伟大的社会主义勇敢前进。我们对于阴谋破坏我们今天和明天的美满生活，破坏亚洲和世界和平的任何侵略行为，是决不容许的！
    我们中国人民非常重视亚洲各国人民之间的友好关系。中国人民确信：一切社会制度不同的国家是能够在和平的环境中友好共处。中印、中缅总理联合声明中提出的和平共处五项原则，和一年来我国同这些国家所发展的友好关系的事实，就是证明。
    历史的经验指出：人类的正义要求，是任何黑暗势力所不能阻止和抹煞的，人民的斗争一定会取得胜利。企图“阻挡”人类社会的发展和“勾销”人类的共同愿望的任何行为和阴谋，都必将自食其果，自趋灭亡。我们要告诉那些不顾为和平民主和民族独立而奋斗的全世界人民的崇高愿望和意志而实行侵略政策的帝国主义分子，如果他们敢发动战争，决不能逃出像历史上被人民的力量所消灭了的那些人类罪人所遭受的同样命运。
    让我们向一切为保卫和平和民族独立的战士致敬！
    敬祝亚洲国家会议胜利召开。
