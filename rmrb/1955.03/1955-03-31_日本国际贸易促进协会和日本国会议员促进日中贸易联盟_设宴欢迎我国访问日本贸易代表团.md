Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th: The Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade held a banquet on the evening of the 29th to welcome the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan. The banquet was held at the Tokyo Kaikan, attended by 130 people.
    Japanese attendees included: Shōzō Murata, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; Masanosuke Ikeda, Standing Director of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade; Kazuo Suzuki, Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association; Kaheita Okazaki, Manager of Ikegai Iron Works; Den Kawakatsu, Manager of Japan Textile Spindle Manufacturing Company; and Kōichi Uda, Manager of Yodogawa Steel Works, among others.
    Also attending the banquet were Jiichirō Matsumoto, President of the Japan-China Friendship Association; Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee; and Akira Kazami, a member of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, among others.
    Also attending the banquet were Democratic Party member Shūtarō Matsuura, Left-wing Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki, Right-wing Socialist Party member Mitsu Kono, Liberal Party member Ginzō Nagashima, Labor-Farmer Party member Kihachiro Kimura, and Communist Party member Kanichi Kawakami, among others.
    In his welcoming speech, Shōzō Murata said that Japan and China have close relations geographically, historically, and culturally, but today they are in a state of mutual isolation, which is extremely unnatural. Murata said: Through the efforts of both China and Japan, the trade achievements of the past two Japan-China trade agreements have gradually increased. This achievement is mainly due to China's lenient attitude towards the classification trade system, but because Japan's export varieties are subject to certain restrictions, the quantity and types of trade have not been able to develop as they should. The Japan International Trade Promotion Association is willing to make active efforts to ease and eliminate this restriction. He then said that in order to respond to the hopes of the Japanese people, in addition to concluding agreements, we hope that the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan can have extensive discussions with experts from the Japanese industrial community, visit factories, and provide assistance.
    Masanosuke Ikeda said in his welcoming speech: Since the representatives of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade signed the Japan-China trade agreement in Beijing in 1953, although there have been various obstacles in the meantime, the trade volume between the two countries has increased significantly compared to before. This fact shows that there is a bright future for the development of trade between the two countries. He then said that friendly contacts between the two countries can not only strengthen economic ties, but also deepen the friendship between the people of the two countries. There may be many obstacles in the future, but as long as we work hard, any difficulties can be overcome.
    Next, Delegation Leader Lei Renmin delivered a speech. He first expressed his gratitude for the welcome from Japanese friends. He said: Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has advocated the restoration and development of commercial and trade relations with governments and people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. On this basis, the trade relationship between China and Japan, through the continuous efforts of the Chinese government and people, and the efforts of people from all walks of life in Japan who are enthusiastic about China-Japan trade, has achieved a certain degree of restoration and development.
    He then said: The purpose of the Chinese trade delegation's visit to Japan this time is to further promote the development of trade relations between China and Japan, to discuss new China-Japan trade agreements and other trade-related issues on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan. He expressed his hope that, with the cooperation of Japanese friends, this visit will be beneficial to the development of economic and trade relations between China and Japan and the enhancement of mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan.
    The banquet proceeded in a harmonious and warm atmosphere.

    日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟
    设宴欢迎我国访问日本贸易代表团
    新华社东京三十日电　二十九日下午七时，日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟举行宴会，欢迎中国访问日本贸易代表团。宴会在东京会馆举行，出席的有一百三十人。
    日本方面出席宴会的有：日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟常任理事池田正之辅、中日贸易促进会常务理事铃木一雄、池贝铁工公司经理冈崎嘉平太、日本纺锭制造公司经理川胜传和淀川制钢所经理宇田耕一等人。
    出席宴会的还有日中友好协会会长松本治一郎、日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫、恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议委员风见章等人。
    出席宴会的还有民主党议员松浦周太郎、左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎、右派社会党议员河野密、自由党议员长岛银藏、劳农党议员木村禧八郎和共产党议员川上贯一等人。
    村田省藏在致欢迎词中说，中日两国不论在地理上、历史上、文化上都有亲密的关系，但是今天却处在一种互相隔绝的状态，这是极为不自然的。村田省藏说：过去的两次中日贸易协议，经过中日双方的努力，贸易的成绩逐渐有了增进。这种成绩的取得主要还是由中国方面对分类贸易制度采取了宽大的态度，可是由于日本方面的输出品种受到某种限制，所以贸易的数量、种类没有能得到应有的进展。日本国际贸易促进协会愿为缓和和取消这一限制而作积极的努力。他接着说，为了回答日本国民的希望，除了缔结协定之外，我们希望中国访问日本贸易代表团能和日本产业界的专门家进行广泛的恳谈，参观工厂，并给予协助。
    池田正之辅致欢迎词说：自从一九五三年日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的代表在北京签订了日中贸易协议以来，其间虽有种种障碍，但是两国之间的贸易额却比以前有了显著的增加。这个事实表明，今后发展两国之间的贸易，一定会有光明的前途。他接着说，两国间的友好接触，不单是可以加强经济联系，而且会加深两国人民间的友好。今后也许还会发生许多障碍，但是只要我们努力，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    接着雷任民团长致词。他首先对日本朋友们的欢迎表示感谢。他说：中华人民共和国从成立以来，就主张在平等互利的基础上同各国政府和人民，恢复并发展通商贸易关系。在这个基础上，中国和日本的贸易关系，经过中国政府和人民的不断努力，和日本热心于中日贸易的各界人士的努力，获得了一定的恢复和发展。
    他接着说：中国贸易代表团这次来访问日本，就是为了促进中日两国间贸易关系的进一步发展，在平等互利的基础上商谈新的中日贸易协议和其他与贸易有关的问题，并且增进中日两国人民的相互了解和友谊。他表示希望，在日本朋友们的合作下，这次访问将有益于中日两国经济贸易关系的发展和中日两国人民的相互了解和友谊的增进。
    宴会在和谐、热烈的空气中进行。
