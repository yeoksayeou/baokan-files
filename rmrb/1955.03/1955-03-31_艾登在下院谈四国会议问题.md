Xinhua News Agency, London, March 29th (TASS): According to Reuters, Labour MP Henderson asked in the House of Commons whether, considering the recent talks by Eisenhower and Bulganin in support of holding a Four-Power Conference, the government now believes there are no obstacles to holding such a conference.

Foreign Secretary Eden replied: "We have been discussing with our allies how we should proceed now."

Referring to his previous remarks on procedural matters, Eden said that these procedures stipulated that the first stage of the conference be attended by officials, followed by a meeting of foreign ministers, and that if all went well, perhaps other levels of meetings would be held.

Henderson asked if it should be understood that measures are now being taken to hold a meeting of officials.

Eden replied: "We are discussing this with our allies."

    艾登在下院谈四国会议问题
    新华社三十日讯　塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：据路透社消息，英国工党议员汉德逊在下院会议上问道，考虑到最近艾森豪威尔和布尔加宁所发表的支持举行四国会议的谈话以后，政府是否认为举行四国会议现在已经没有障碍。
    外交大臣艾登回答说：“我们已经同我们的盟国商讨我们现在用怎样的方式行动。”
    艾登谈到他以前关于程序方式的谈话时说，当然，这些方式规定第一阶段的会议由官员级参加举行，然后举行外交部长级会议，如果一切都进行得顺利的话，也许将举行其他级的会议。
    汉德逊问道，是否应该理解为：现在正在为举行官员级会议采取措施。
    艾登回答说：“我们正同我们的盟国讨论这个问题。”
