The First Congress of Hero, Model, and Meritorious Representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, commended the heroic models and deeds that have emerged from all departments of the Air Force over the past five years, selected new heroic models, and summarized and exchanged the rich experiences of these heroic models in combat, work, and study. It is about to close today. The heroic models of our People's Air Force and all Air Force personnel will further promote the spirit of revolutionary heroism, accelerate the regularization and modernization of our Air Force, and fight more bravely and effectively to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and safeguard Asian and world peace.

Our people's great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, pointed out at the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949: "We will not only have a powerful army, but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy." At the beginning of the establishment of our People's Air Force, he specifically instructed: "Create a powerful People's Air Force, annihilate the remaining enemies, and consolidate national defense." At the opening of this conference, Comrade Mao Zedong once again pointed out in his inscription to the conference: "Establish a strong People's Air Force to defend the motherland and prepare to defeat the invaders." These are very important instructions. Now, American imperialism is not only directly occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan, establishing military bases there, and threatening us with so-called "massive retaliation" and atomic war, preventing us from liberating Taiwan; but also establishing countless military bases in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, and other places, actively preparing to launch a large-scale war of aggression against mainland China in order to restore its imperialist rule over mainland China. Under this situation, the sacred task of our People's Air Force and the entire People's Liberation Army is to strengthen preparations so as to give the invaders a heavy blow anytime and anywhere to defend our great motherland.

Our people have used their own strength to heroically and unyieldingly resist many imperialist aggressions, and have also directly resisted American imperialist aggression in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, causing it to suffer a tragic defeat. The Chinese people will never be intimidated by any threats from the aggressors. Now, we are waging a persistent struggle to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan. In order to win the final victory in this struggle and to cope with sudden incidents that the enemy may launch, we must also greatly strengthen our army, strengthen our navy, and equally greatly strengthen our air force.

Over the past five years, our country has made tremendous efforts and achieved brilliant achievements in establishing and strengthening its People's Air Force. In the march towards the peaceful liberation of Tibet, our air force heroically broke through the "air forbidden zone" claimed by American imperialism, opened up the Kangzang Plateau air route, and powerfully supported the ground forces that were advancing arduously in the snowy mountains. During the period when American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and constantly used its air force to cross the border and attack the northeastern region of our country, our young air force constantly inflicted heavy blows on the enemy's air force on the Yalu River, shooting down and damaging a large number of enemy planes, and defending the motherland's airspace and the people of the Northeast. In the struggle to liberate the enemy-occupied coastal islands since last year, our People's Air Force closely cooperated with the army and navy in combat, constantly bombing the enemy's solid fortifications and various warships, achieving great results. The heroic combat of the air force promoted the rapid liberation of many islands such as Yijiangshan and Dachen.

In the struggles of the above-mentioned periods, many outstanding heroic model figures emerged in the air force units. Some of them disregarded their own safety in air combat, showing a high degree of bravery, tenacity, and resourcefulness, and made brilliant contributions to the motherland and the people; some made very important inventions in technology, solving some of the most difficult problems in flying and navigation; some created advanced experience in their work, improved work efficiency, and saved a large amount of materials for the country. Their heroic and exemplary deeds inspire the fighting will and revolutionary heroism of all air force units, stimulate the initiative and creativity of all air force units, and powerfully promote the development and growth of the People's Air Force. We pay our deepest respect and gratitude to these heroic model figures, and also pay our deepest respect to the entire air force and all the people's armed forces of our country.

However, our air force is still very young. We do not yet have sufficient knowledge and experience in command, combat, navigation, and other air force business construction. In order to further build a strong People's Air Force, all flight personnel must step up their efforts to study and master advanced and complex aviation technology, improve air combat tactics, so that they can perform combat missions under any weather conditions. All commanding officers should step up their efforts to improve their ability to organize and command combat in order to comprehensively improve the combat effectiveness of the air force units. Cadres engaged in training work should continuously improve the quality of training work and step up the training of a large number of politically and professionally strong backbone members of the troops to meet the needs of establishing a stronger People's Air Force.

In order to quickly improve our air combat tactics and air combat command capabilities, and increase aviation knowledge, the air force units should deeply summarize the experience of aviation, combat, and command combat over the past few years, turn these experiences into systematic and improved knowledge, and use it for self-education. We must be good at summarizing experience in order to improve quickly.

Our air force, due to its recent establishment, is still insufficient in terms of organization, discipline, and the planning and accuracy of task execution. However, a technical arm of the service like the air force especially needs a high degree of organization, discipline, planning, and accuracy. Therefore, strengthening the regularization construction of the troops and rapidly improving in the above-mentioned aspects is of particular importance now. All cadres in the air force units must set an example, influence their subordinates, and actively enlighten the political consciousness of their subordinates so that everyone can consciously and automatically work hard in these areas.

In order to effectively build a strong People's Air Force, and in order to rapidly improve the existing air force units in all aspects, we must resolutely oppose and deeply criticize any feelings of pride and complacency. If we only learn some superficial knowledge and technology, become complacent, only see achievements, do not see shortcomings, can only receive praise, cannot listen to criticism, and relax our learning and training, then it is impossible to further learn advanced and complex knowledge and technology. Therefore, we should always be conscientious, prudent and humble, constantly learn, constantly improve, and not be proud of any achievements or relax our efforts because of any victory.

With the support of the people of the whole country and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people, and with various favorable conditions, our air force units should highly promote the spirit of revolutionary heroism, closely cooperate with other units and other arms of the People's Liberation Army, and work harder to shoulder the glorious task of defending the motherland entrusted to us by the motherland and the people.

### 努力建设强大的人民空军

    努力建设强大的人民空军
    中国人民解放军空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会，表扬了空军各部门五年来所涌现的英雄模范人物和事迹，评选了新的英雄模范，总结和交流了这些英雄模范人物在战斗、工作和学习中的丰富经验，今天就要闭幕了。我国人民空军的英雄模范和全体空军人员，将进一步发扬革命英雄主义的精神，加速我国空军的正规化现代化建设，更加英勇地有成效地为保卫祖国、解放台湾、维护亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。
    我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志在一九四九年中华人民共和国成立的时候就已指出：“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”在我国人民空军建军之初，他又具体指示：“创造强大的人民空军，歼灭残敌，巩固国防。”这次大会开幕的时候，毛泽东同志在赠给大会的题词中再次指出：“建立一支强大的人民空军，保卫祖国，准备战胜侵略者。”这些都是非常重要的指示。现在，美帝国主义不仅直接侵占着我们的神圣领土台湾，在那里建立军事基地，用所谓
  “大规模报复”和原子战争威胁我们，不让我们去解放台湾；而且在日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾和泰国等地建立了无数的军事基地，积极准备对我国大陆发动大规模的侵略战争，以恢复它对我国大陆的帝国主义统治。在这种形势之下，我国人民空军和整个人民解放军的神圣任务，就是要加强准备，以便随时随地给予侵略者以沉重的打击，保卫我们的伟大祖国。
    我国人民曾经用自己的力量英勇不屈地抗击过许多帝国主义的侵略，也在抗美援朝战争中直接抗击过美帝国主义的侵略，并且使它遭受了悲惨的失败。我国人民是永远也不会被侵略者的任何威胁所吓倒的。现在，我们正在为解放自己的神圣领土台湾而进行着坚持的斗争。为了争取这一斗争的最后胜利，为了应付敌人可能发动的突然事变，我们还必须大大地加强我们的陆军，加强我们的海军，同样必须大大地加强我们的空军。
    五年来，我们国家在建立和壮大自己的人民空军方面进行了巨大的努力，取得了光辉的成就。我们的空军在和平解放西藏的进军中，曾经英勇地突破美帝国主义所称的“空中禁区”，开辟了康藏高原航线，有力地支援供应了在雪山中艰苦进军的地面部队。在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，并且不断地以空军越境袭击我国东北地区的期间，我们的年轻空军曾经在鸭绿江边不断地给敌人空军以沉重的打击，击落和击伤了大量的敌机，保卫了祖国的领空和东北的人民。在去年以来解放沿海敌占岛屿的斗争中，我们的人民空军密切配合陆军海军的战斗，不断地轰炸敌人的坚固工事和各种军舰，取得很大的战果。空军的英勇战斗，促进了一江山和大陈等许多岛屿的迅速解放。
    在上述各时期的斗争中，空军部队里出现了许多杰出的英雄模范人物。他们有的在空战中奋不顾身，表现了高度的勇敢顽强和机智，为祖国和人民立下了光辉的战功；有的在技术上作出了十分重要的发明，解决了飞行和领航中某些最难解决的问题；有的在工作中创造了先进的经验，提高了工作的效率，为国家节省了大量的物资。他们的英雄和模范事迹，鼓舞着所有空军部队的战斗意志和革命英雄主义精神，激发着所有空军部队的主动性和创造性，有力地促进了人民空军的发展和成长。我们谨向这些英雄模范人物致以深切的敬意和感谢，同时也向整个空军部队和我国一切人民武装部队致以深切的敬意。
    但是，我们的空军还很年轻，无论在指挥上、作战上、航行上和其他空军业务的建设上，我们都还没有足够的知识和经验。为了进一步建设一支强大的人民空军，所有的飞行人员必须加紧努力，学习和掌握高级的复杂的航空技术，提高空战战术，使自己能够在任何气象条件下执行战斗任务。所有的指挥人员，应该加紧提高自己组织和指挥战斗的能力，以便全面地提高空军部队的战斗力。担任训练工作的干部，应该不断地改善和提高训练工作的质量，加紧培养出大批政治上和业务上都很强的部队骨干，以适应建立更强大的人民空军的需要。
    为了迅速提高我们的空战战术和空战指挥能力，增进航空知识，空军部队应该深入地总结几年来航空、作战和指挥作战的经验，把这些经验变成系统的和提高了的知识，用以进行自我教育。必须善于总结经验，我们才能很快的提高。
    我们的空军由于成立不久，所以无论在组织性、纪律性和执行任务的计划性、准确性各方面，也还是不够的。而空军这样的技术兵种却特别需要有高度的组织性、纪律性、计划性和准确性。因此，加强部队的正规化建设，在上述各方面迅速提高，现在就具有特别重要的意义。所有空军部队中的干部必须以身作则，影响下级，并且积极启发下级同志的政治自觉性，使大家都能自觉自动地在这些方面努力。
    为了有成效地建立强大的人民空军，为了使现有的空军部队迅速在各方面提高，必须坚决反对和深入批判任何骄傲自满的情绪。如果我们仅仅学到一些皮毛的知识和技术，就自满起来，光看见成绩，看不见缺点，光能受表扬，不能听批评，而且放松了学习和锻炼，那就没有可能更进一步学到高级的复杂的知识和技术。因此，我们在任何时候都应该兢兢业业，谨慎谦虚，不断学习，不断提高，不因任何成绩而骄傲，不因任何胜利而松懈自己的努力。
    有全国人民的支持，有中国共产党的正确领导，有苏联人民的兄弟般的援助，有着各种有利的条件，我们的空军部队应该高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，和人民解放军的其他部队、其他兵种密切配合，更加努力担负起祖国和人民所托付的保卫祖国的光荣任务。
