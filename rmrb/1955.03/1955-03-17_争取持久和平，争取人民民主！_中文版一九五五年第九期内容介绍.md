The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" 1955, No. 9 has been published.

This issue publishes two editorials: the first is titled "The Great Transforming Role of Leninist Thought." The editorial states that Leninist doctrine is believed by hundreds of millions of people, and it illuminates the road to freedom and happiness. Its strength lies in its high degree of scientific accuracy, truthfulness, and creativity, and it constantly develops and enriches itself with new arguments. Lenin's doctrine on building a socialist society pays particular attention to the development of heavy industry. Only heavy industry can guarantee the development of all sectors of the socialist economy, including agriculture, light industry, and the food industry. Therefore, heavy industry is the foundation for the continuous improvement of the welfare of the working people. Heavy industry ensures that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have invincible defense forces, ensuring their freedom and independence. The editorial emphasizes that the people of the socialist countries steadfastly follow Lenin's path and are building a bright new society with unparalleled enthusiasm. That people of all countries are living and struggling under the influence of the great Leninist doctrine is a major conclusion of twentieth-century world history.

The other editorial in this issue celebrates International Women's Day on March 8th. It is titled "Women are a Powerful Force for Peace." The editorial states that while celebrating International Women's Day this year, people of all countries are launching a great movement to maintain and consolidate peace, and millions of people are actively signing in support of the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the people of the world. Women, who account for half of the world's population, play a huge role in the struggle of people in all countries to defend and strengthen peace and security. Millions of women in all countries are increasingly firmly opposed to preparing for a new world war, opposed to the revival of German militarism, and demanding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. This selfless struggle demonstrates their determination to protect their children, defend the lives of their loved ones, and strive for world peace. Women are a powerful force for peace.

This issue contains articles by Cai Chang, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Liberated Women - Builders of New China," Bruna Conti, secretary of the Italian Women's League, "Italian Women Fight for Peace, Fight for Liberation," and Maria Ginova, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, "Women are a Powerful Force in Bulgaria's Socialist Transformation of Agriculture."

This issue also contains an article by I. Hendrych, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, "Mass Political Work of the Czechoslovak Communist Party." The article points out that mass political work is an important link in consolidating the unbreakable ties between the Party and the working people and enhancing the enthusiasm of the working people. The tasks of the national economy this year are complex and arduous. Close attention must be paid to the work of industry, especially heavy industry. Increasing labor productivity is an urgent issue. To successfully complete these tasks, it is necessary to carry out mass political work more actively and on a larger scale. Improving agricultural production has become a task for the whole people. In this regard, carrying out extensive and regular mass political work among farmers, raising their political awareness, and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance are of utmost importance.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第九期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第九期中文版已经出版。
    这一期发表了两篇社论：第一篇的题目是：“列宁主义思想的伟大改造作用”。社论说，列宁主义学说为亿万人民所信仰，它照亮了自由幸福的道路。它的力量在于它的高度的科学性、真实性和创造性，它用新的论点来不断地发展和丰富自己。列宁主义关于建设社会主义社会的学说特别注重发展重工业的问题。只有重工业才能保证社会主义经济各部门，包括农业、轻工业和食品工业的发展，因此，重工业是劳动人民的福利不断提高的基础。重工业确保苏联以及社会主义阵营各国有不可战胜的国防力量，确保它们的自由和独立。社论强调说，社会主义阵营各国人民坚定不移地遵循列宁的道路，正以无比的热情建设美好的新社会。各国人民是在伟大的列宁主义学说的影响下生活和斗争的，这就是二十世纪世界历史的一个主要结论。
    这一期另一篇社论是庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的，它的题目是：“妇女是争取和平的强大力量”。社论说，今年庆祝国际妇女节的时候，各国人民正在展开维护和巩固和平的伟大运动，千百万人正在踊跃签名拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会的告全世界人民书。占世界人口半数的妇女，在各国人民保卫及加强和平和安全的斗争中起着巨大的作用。世界各国的千百万妇女越来越坚决地反对准备新的世界战争，反对复活德国军国主义，要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器。这种忘我的斗争表明了她们要保护子女、保卫亲人的生命和争取世界和平。妇女是争取和平的一支强大力量。
    这一期刊载的文章有中国共产党中央委员蔡畅的“解放了的妇女——新中国的建设者”，意大利妇女联盟书记布·康蒂的“意大利妇女争取和平，争取解放”，保加利亚共产党候补中央委员玛·吉诺娃的“妇女是保加利亚对农业进行社会主义改造的强大力量”。
    这一期还刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记处书记伊·亨德里赫的文章“捷克斯洛伐克共产党的群众政治工作”。文章指出，群众政治工作是巩固党同劳动人民的牢不可破的联系和提高劳动人民的积极性的重要环节。今年国民经济的任务是复杂而艰巨的。必须密切注意工业特别是重工业的工作。提高劳动生产率是一个迫切的问题。要胜利地完成这些任务，就必须更积极地更大规模地进行群众政治工作。提高农业生产已经变成了全民的任务。在这方面，对农民进行广泛的经常的群众政治工作，提高他们的政治觉悟和加强工农联盟，具有极其重要的作用。　（新华社）
