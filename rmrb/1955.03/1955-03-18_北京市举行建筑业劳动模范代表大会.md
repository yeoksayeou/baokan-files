    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: Beijing held a Construction Industry Labor Model Representative Conference on the 16th and 17th. At the conference, 399 construction industry labor models and model units were rewarded. Due to the continuous improvement of labor enthusiasm and technical level, more labor models have emerged among the construction workers participating in the capital's construction in 1954, nearly ten times more than in 1953, with technicians accounting for about a quarter of them. The labor models rewarded this time include plasterer Cheng Yongxiang, who actively applied advanced experience and created an advanced plastering tool, exceeding the plastering quota by 41%; engineer Zhu Qian, who strived to study technology and adopted the Soviet pre-fabricated small beam ribbed floor slab advanced experience, thus reducing the cost per square meter of floor slab by four yuan (new currency); the Pan Jiacheng bricklaying team, which had no accidents for four years; and carpenter Zhang Baokun, who has consistently overfulfilled tasks and has been elected as a labor model for three consecutive years, among others.
    In 1954, Beijing's construction workers built a total of more than three million square meters of buildings, including factories, dormitories, classrooms, clubs, and public buildings. Responding to the call of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they overfulfilled the tasks of improving labor productivity and reducing project costs. According to statistics from the seven construction engineering companies and one professional installation company under the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, the average labor productivity of construction workers increased by 47% in 1954. If the saved labor were used to build four-story buildings with an area of 1,500 square meters each, 147 buildings could be built. The construction costs of the aforementioned companies were also reduced by a total of 21.95 million yuan (new currency) last year. Last year, more than 130 youth shock brigades emerged on the construction sites, most of whom were able to consistently maintain the glory of comprehensively overfulfilling tasks.
    At the meeting, many labor models expressed in their speeches that they must guard against arrogance and rashness, learn modestly, improve their technical level, and strive to comprehensively complete the capital's basic construction tasks in 1955.
    At the meeting, the five units that won the inter-factory labor competition in 193 construction sites in Beijing in the fourth quarter of 1954 were also rewarded.

    北京市举行建筑业劳动模范代表大会
    【新华社十七日讯】北京市在十六、十七两日举行建筑业劳动模范代表大会，会上有三百九十九个建筑业劳动模范和模范单位受到了奖励。由于劳动积极性和技术水平的不断提高，一九五四年参加首都建设的建筑工人中涌现出了更多的劳动模范，人数比一九五三年时增加了近十倍，其中技术人员约占四分之一。这次受到奖励的劳动模范，有积极运用先进经验，创造先进的抹灰器，因而超过抹灰定额百分之四十一的抹灰工人程永祥；有努力钻研技术，采用苏联预制小梁密肋式楼板先进经验，因而使每平方公尺楼板能降低成本四元（新币）的工程师朱乾；有四年不出事故的潘家诚瓦工小组；还有一贯超额完成任务，连续三年当选劳动模范的木工张宝昆等。
    北京市的建筑工人在一九五四年一年内共建筑了三百多万平方公尺面积的建筑物，其中有厂房、宿舍、教室、俱乐部和公用建筑等。他们响应中共北京市委员会的号召，超额完成了提高劳动生产率、降低工程成本的任务。根据市建筑工程局所属的七个建筑工程公司和一个专业安装公司的统计，一九五四年建筑工人的劳动生产率平均提高了百分之四十七，如果把节省下来的劳动力用来建筑每幢面积一千五百平方公尺的四层楼房，可以建筑一百四十七幢。上述几个公司去年的建筑成本也一共降低了二千一百九十五万元（新币）。去年在建筑工地上特别还出现了一百三十多个青年突击队，他们大多数能经常地保持全面超额完成任务的光荣。
    会上许多劳动模范在讲话中表示，一定要戒骄戒躁，虚心学习，提高技术水平，为全面完成一九五五年首都的基本建设任务而努力。
    会上，并奖励了一九五四年第四季度北京市一百九十三个建筑工地厂际劳动竞赛获得优胜的五个单位。
