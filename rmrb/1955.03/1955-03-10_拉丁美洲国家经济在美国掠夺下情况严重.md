Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: According to TASS reports, the economic situation in Latin American countries controlled by American monopoly capital is serious.

　　The agriculture of these countries is in a state of crisis. The area sown with major agricultural products such as grain is constantly shrinking, and farmers' incomes are declining, which has led to the bankruptcy of large numbers of farmers.

　　According to figures cited by newspapers, the current grain output of Latin American countries is 30 percent lower than it was ten years ago. This situation is caused by the efforts of American monopoly capital to keep Latin America as a source of raw materials for the United States. In the past two years, the economies of Latin American countries that supply agricultural raw materials have suffered major blows due to the price drops of coffee, sugar, and other commodities by American companies. For example, the coffee price drop that began in August of last year caused Latin American countries to lose more than $400 million. Last year's sugar price drop also cost Cuba $100 million. In order to maintain their income levels, Latin American countries have been forced to expand the planting of their coffee, sugar, and other agricultural products for export, while reducing the area sown with grains and other food crops. This has made their food problem very difficult, and they have to import grain from abroad at high prices. For example, Venezuela is currently forced to import two-thirds of the grain it needs, and Chile has to import one-third. American monopoly capital is taking advantage of this situation to sell their surplus agricultural products to these countries at high prices.

　　The industrial situation in Latin American countries is no better than that of agriculture. The industrial output of most countries remains at the level of last year, and last year was a very difficult year for industrial production in Latin American countries. For example, the production of major enterprises in Chile's metallurgical industry decreased by one-half last year, and textile factories in many cities only operated for 24 hours a week.

　　Newspaper reports indicate that American monopoly capital has intensified its plunder of Latin America's natural resources in recent years. For example, the United States Steel Corporation, controlled by the Morgan consortium, obtained the privilege of exploiting rich iron ore deposits in Venezuela at a cost of three cents per hectare, earning millions of dollars in profit last year. American monopoly capital has also forced Latin American countries to enact tax laws that allow these countries to collect only a negligible amount of tax from the huge profits seized by American companies. Therefore, American companies currently earn higher profits from their investments in Latin America than anywhere else, sometimes even as high as 30 percent of the capital amount per year.

　　American companies also earn billions of dollars in profits from various predatory foreign trade transactions. They take advantage of Latin American countries' dependence on the American market to sell raw materials, and, under the pretext that many raw materials are strategic materials, they control and lower the prices of these countries' exports, while forcing these countries to buy American goods at high prices. American newspapers recently pointed out that Latin American countries now sell the same amount of raw materials as they did ten years ago, but can only buy back 70 percent of the manufactured goods that they could buy back ten years ago. The decline in raw material prices and the rise in manufactured goods prices, coupled with the increase in Latin America's imports from the United States, has led to a sharp increase in Latin American countries' foreign trade deficits, reaching unprecedented peaks in recent years.

　　In order to make up for the trade deficit, Latin American countries are forced to borrow new debts from the United States at the cost of further sacrificing their sovereignty. Currently, the interest that Latin American countries pay on their enslaving American loans is increasing every year, and it accounts for an increasingly large part of Latin American countries' national income. This undermines the financial situation of Latin American countries and causes uncontrollable inflation and currency devaluation. According to estimates by the British "Birmingham Post," compared with 1939, the purchasing power of Argentina's currency has decreased by nearly 85 percent last year, the purchasing power of Brazil's currency has decreased by nearly 90 percent, and the currencies of Paraguay, Peru, Mexico, and other countries have decreased by more than 70 percent.

    拉丁美洲国家经济在美国掠夺下情况严重
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社消息：在美国垄断资本控制下的拉丁美洲国家的经济情况严重。
    这些国家的农业正处于危机状态中，粮食等主要农产品的播种面积正在不断缩小，农民的收入正在下降，这就引起了大批农民破产。
    根据报纸引用的数字，拉丁美洲国家目前的粮食产量比十年前减少百分之三十。这种情况是由于美国垄断资本竭力使拉丁美洲继续成为美国的原料供应地而引起的。在过去两年中，由于美国公司使咖啡、糖和其他商品跌价，那些供应农业原料的拉丁美洲国家的经济就遭到了重大打击。例如，从去年八月间开始的咖啡跌价使拉丁美洲国家损失了四亿美元以上。去年糖的跌价也使古巴损失了一亿美元。拉丁美洲国家为了保持它们的收入水平，被迫扩大了它们的咖啡、糖和其他用来输出的农产品的种植，而减少了谷物和其他粮食作物的播种面积。这样就使它们的粮食问题十分困难，不得不以高价从国外输入粮食。例如，目前委内瑞拉被迫输入的粮食已经占它所需要的粮食量的三分之二，智利要占三分之一。美国垄断资本就利用这种情况把它们的剩余农产品高价卖给这些国家。
    拉丁美洲国家的工业情况也并不比农业好。大多数国家的工业产量仍然停留在去年的水平上，而去年正是拉丁美洲国家的工业生产十分困难的一年。例如，智利冶金工业的主要企业在去年的生产就减少了二分之一，许多城市的纺织工厂每星期只开工二十四小时。
    报纸消息表明，美国垄断资本最近几年来已经加紧了对拉丁美洲的天然资源的掠夺。例如，摩根财团所控制的美国钢铁公司在委内瑞拉以三角钱一公顷的代价获得了开采丰富的铁矿的特权，在去年获得千百万美元的利润。美国垄断资本又强迫拉丁美洲国家制定税法，使这些国家只能从美国公司攫取的巨额利润中征收到微不足道的税款。因此，目前美国公司从拉丁美洲的投资中所获得的利润要比在其他任何地方都高，有时一年的利润甚至高达资本额的百分之三十。
    美国公司在各种强盗式的对外贸易买卖中也获得许多亿美元的利益。它们利用拉丁美洲国家要依赖美国市场来销售原料的情况，并且借口许多原料是战略物资而加以控制，降低这些国家输出的货物的价格，同时又强迫这些国家以高价购买美国的商品。美国报纸最近指出，拉丁美洲国家现在出售同十年前数量相同的原料，却只能买回它们在十年前所能买回的制成品百分之七十。原料价格的下降和制成品价格的上涨，再加上拉丁美洲从美国进口的商品的增加，使得拉丁美洲国家的对外贸易逆差急剧增加，在最近几年中已经达到空前未有的高峰。
    为了弥补贸易的逆差，拉丁美洲国家就被迫以进一步牺牲主权的条件去向美国借新债。目前拉丁美洲国家付给奴役性的美国贷款的利息每年都在增加，并且占去了拉丁美洲国家国民收入中越来越大的一部分。这样就破坏了拉丁美洲国家的财政状况，引起了不可控制的通货膨胀和货币的贬值。据英国“伯明翰邮报”估计，以去年同一九三九年比较，阿根廷货币的购买力减少了将近百分之八十五，巴西货币减少了将近百分之九十，巴拉圭、秘鲁、墨西哥等国货币都减少了百分之七十以上。
