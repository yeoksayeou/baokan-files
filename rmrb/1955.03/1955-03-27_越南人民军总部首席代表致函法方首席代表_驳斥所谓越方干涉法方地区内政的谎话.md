Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 24th (News dispatch by the Vietnam News Agency on the 23rd): The chief representative of the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Armistice Commission in Vietnam, Văn Tiến Dũng, wrote a letter to the chief representative of the delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces, Debreuil, on March 21st, refuting the slander of the so-called Vietnam People's Army's "interference" in the internal affairs of the French Union Forces in South Vietnam.

Văn Tiến Dũng pointed out: The French Union Forces side insisted that we had left weapons and organized "secret assassination committees" in the areas under its control in order to interfere in its internal affairs; and that the acts of terror and retaliation against residents and former resistance members under the command of the French Union Forces side were committed by the Vietnam People's Army.

Văn Tiến Dũng said: We resolutely declare that these are all groundless and fictitious claims by the French Union Forces side.

Văn Tiến Dũng pointed out: Our armed forces and administrative organs correctly implemented the Geneva Accords and had completely withdrawn from all assembly areas south of the provisional military demarcation line within or before the stipulated time limit. Before leaving these assembly areas, we properly and systematically handed them over to the French Union Forces. Many handover operations were conducted in the presence of inspection teams from the International Commission. Therefore, the assertion that we had left personnel and weapons to interfere in the administrative work of these areas is unfounded.

Văn Tiến Dũng also said: Regarding the large number of acts of terror occurring in South Vietnam, the massacres of residents, and the retaliation against former resistance members, in fact, everyone knows that these acts were carried out by the Ngô Đình Diệm government with the encouragement and connivance of the French Union Forces. Through investigations into the incidents in Ngân Sơn, Chí Thạnh, Hà Lâm, Trà Cú, Vĩnh Xuân, Mai Xá and Bình Thành, the International Commission determined that the French Union Forces side had violated Articles 14(c) and 15(d) of the Geneva Accords.

Văn Tiến Dũng further pointed out: Facts prove that the Vietnam People's Army has never interfered in the internal affairs of areas controlled by the French Union Forces. On the contrary, it was the French Union Forces that had interfered in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and infringed upon its sovereignty. For example, in Ba Lang, French ships had contacted a group of rioters who were opposing the local administrative authorities by force. The Ngô Đình Diệm government also left its agents in several areas belonging to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, using slander and violence to force residents to relocate.

Văn Tiến Dũng said: The French Union Forces side's slander that the Vietnam People's Army is interfering in its internal affairs serves a dual purpose: to cover up the French Union Forces side's own violations of the armistice agreement, and to create an excuse for the Ngô Đình Diệm government to intensify its acts of terror and massacre against the residents of South Vietnam.

Văn Tiến Dũng concluded: We strongly protest against the above-mentioned violations of the agreement and slander, and demand that the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces stop these acts.

    越南人民军总部首席代表致函法方首席代表
    驳斥所谓越方干涉法方地区内政的谎话
    【新华社河内二十四日讯】据越南通讯社二十三日讯：驻越南中央联合停战委员会的越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇三月二十一日写信给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表德布勒比松，驳斥所谓越南人民军“干涉”法兰西联邦部队方面在南越的内政的谰言。
    文进勇指出：法兰西联邦部队方面硬说我们曾在它控制下的地区留下了武器，组织了“秘密暗杀委员会”，以此来干涉它的内政；又说，在法兰西联邦部队方面指挥下对居民和前抗战人员进行的恐怖和报复行为是越南人民军干的。
    文进勇说：我们坚决声明，这些全都是法兰西联邦部队方面的毫无根据的和虚妄的说法。
    文进勇指出：我们的武装部队和行政机关正确地履行了日内瓦协定，在规定时限以内或是以前已经完全从临时军事分界线以南的各个集结地区撤退。在离开这些集结地区以前，我们曾正确地有条不紊地把这些地区移交给法兰西联邦部队。许多移交工作都是在国际委员会视察小组在场的情况下进行的。因此，关于我们曾留下了人员和武器以便干涉这些地区的行政工作的说法，是没有根据的。
    文进勇又说：关于在南越大量发生的恐怖行为，对居民进行的屠杀和对前抗战人员进行的报复，事实上，每个人都知道，这些行为是吴庭艳政府在法兰西联邦部队的鼓励和纵容之下进行的。国际委员会通过对在银山、志成、河林、泽德、永春、梅棋和平成等地发生的事件的调查，断定法兰西联邦部队方面违反了日内瓦协定第十四条丙款和第十五条丁款。
    文进勇进一步指出：事实证明，越南人民军方面从来没有干涉过法兰西联邦部队控制下的地区的内政。恰巧相反，正是法兰西联邦部队方面曾经干涉越南民主共和国的内政，并且侵犯它的主权。例如在巴浪，法方船只曾同一群以武力反对当地行政当局的暴徒联系。吴庭艳政府还在属于越南民主共和国的若干地区内留下了它的特务分子，用诬蔑和暴力手段使居民迁移。
    文进勇说：法兰西联邦部队方面诬蔑越南人民军方面干涉它的内政，这有着双重目的：掩盖法兰西联邦部队方面本身进行的违反停战协定的行为，并且为吴庭艳政府加紧对南越居民进行恐怖活动和屠杀制造借口。
    文进勇最后说：我们对上述的违反协定的行为和诬蔑提出强硬的抗议，并且要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部制止这些行为。
