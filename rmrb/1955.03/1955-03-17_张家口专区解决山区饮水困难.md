Zhangjiakou Special District Solves Drinking Water Difficulties in Mountainous Areas

    The Zhangjiakou Special District of Hebei Province is systematically solving the drinking water problem for farmers in mountainous areas. The entire Zhangjiakou Special District is mountainous, and many villages lack water sources, making it very difficult for farmers to obtain drinking water. To solve this problem, in 1954, the state invested more than 250 million old yuan to help farmers build drinking water projects. The Zhangjiakou Special Commissioner's Office also sent technical cadres deep into water-scarce areas to help farmers find water sources. To date, 27 drinking water projects have been built in five counties including Yu County and Xuanhua, solving the drinking water difficulties for more than 17,000 people and more than 11,000 livestock in 31 villages. This year, the district plans to build 34 drinking water projects in water-scarce areas of eight counties including Huailai, Yanqing, and Chicheng. These drinking water projects have now been surveyed, and some villages have established construction organizations and are making preparations, so that construction can begin after the thaw.

    张家口专区解决山区饮水困难
    河北省张家口专区有计划地解决山区农民饮水问题。张家口专区全是山区，有不少村庄缺乏水源，农民饮用水非常困难。为了解决这个困难，一九五四年国家投资旧币两亿五千多万元，帮助农民兴修了饮水工程，张家口专署又派了技术干部深入缺水地区帮助农民寻找水源。到目前，已在蔚县、宣化等五县兴修了二十七处饮水工程，解决了三十一个村的一万七千多人和一万一千多头牲畜的饮水困难。今年全区又计划在怀来、延庆、赤城等八县的缺水地区，兴修饮水工程三十四处。这些饮水工程现已勘察完毕，有的村庄已建立起施工组织，正在进行准备工作，待解冻后就可施工。　（国章、蓬瀛）
