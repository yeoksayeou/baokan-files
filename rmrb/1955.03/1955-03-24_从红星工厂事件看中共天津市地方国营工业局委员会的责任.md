On the Responsibility of the CCP Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Committee Regarding the Red Star Factory Incident
    Hu Qi　Li Feng
    There once was a factory in Tianjin where capitalist spies, a Yiguandao preacher, Kuomintang soldiers and ruffians, a Kuomintang district branch committee member, and even a feudal foreman could be found. All these assorted reactionaries gained the trust of the factory director, who consistently advocated "it doesn't matter if it's a black cat or a white cat, as long as it catches mice" and consistently declared "whoever is close to me is a good person, whoever doesn't listen to me will be unlucky." They were promoted en masse to production team leaders, section chiefs, and workshop directors. As a result, the reactionaries took control of some departments of the factory, openly insulted the Communist Party and the People's Government, openly ostracized and attacked Communist Party members, Youth League members, and activists, and arbitrarily oppressed workers, subjected them to corporal punishment, deducted their wages, and humiliated female workers.

    In this factory, the director constantly spread fallacies such as "whoever wants to do administrative work doesn't value Party work" and "the branch secretary either follows the factory director or nitpicks at the factory director, causing disunity." The director restricted the activities of the branch in every way, making it impossible for the branch to independently conduct political and ideological work. When the branch prepared teaching materials for political and ideological education of the staff, he opposed it, and it had to be abandoned. When the branch, according to the instructions of the higher Party committee, led the Party小组 to formulate competition guarantee conditions, he also opposed it, and it was not formulated. Even when the branch cadre went to the workshop to understand the production situation, they were subject to the director's interference; he declared, "The Party must understand the production situation through the factory director." The branch secretary, Liu Kai, was subjected to all sorts of attacks by him because he insisted on Party principles and fought against him, making it impossible for Liu Kai to work.

    In this factory, the director used the excuse that the factory's situation was special to avoid implementing the instructions of higher authorities and resist inspections from higher authorities. Many comrades who went to the factory to understand and help with work were not welcomed but coldly received, and were often forced to return without completing their tasks.

    In this factory, there was no production management system, no office work system, no operating procedures, and no inspection standards. Production materials were wasted greatly, product quality was extremely poor, and production plans were extremely conservative.

    This factory was the Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Red Star Factory, which had only recently completed a thorough democratic re-education, and the director of this factory was Chen Furong, who was recently expelled from the Party and removed from his position as factory director with the approval of the CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee. In the democratic re-education carried out under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee this time, the workers were mobilized to struggle against the fourteen reactionaries who were oppressing them, and were dealt with according to the severity of their crimes, with four arrested and prosecuted, three dismissed from the factory, and seven retained after education (three of whom were removed from their positions as section chiefs).

    The reason why the problems of the Red Star Factory could not be solved for a long time in the past is that the CCP Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Committee, which directly led the Party organization of the Red Star Factory, must bear a major responsibility. The problems of the Red Star Factory are so serious, and Chen Furong's political quality is so bad. Why couldn't the CCP Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Industrial Bureau Party Committee) discover and deal with it earlier? Doesn't this show that the Party Committee has committed a serious bureaucratic error? No, if the Party Committee really knew very little about the problems of the Red Star Factory and Chen Furong's mistakes, it could be said to be serious bureaucracy, but as long as we look at the following facts, we cannot think that the Party Committee's mistakes are limited to serious bureaucracy!

    As early as November 1952, Wu Yongshun, who was then the deputy director of the Red Star Factory, wrote a letter to the Tianjin Municipal Committee's Industrial Department exposing Chen Furong's serious errors in cadre policy in terms of private patronage without principles. The content of this letter was relayed to the Industrial Bureau Party Committee by the Municipal Committee's Industrial Department, asking the Industrial Bureau Party Committee to take responsibility for handling it. But what was the result? Chen Furong's mistakes remained the same, and Wu Yongshun, who exposed Chen Furong's mistakes, was transferred away. Of course, the reason for transferring Wu Yongshun could be grandly stated: "Work needs," while Chen Furong boasted: "I went to the bureau and complained, and Wu Yongshun was transferred away." Isn't the reason obvious? May I ask, what Party principle is this kind of "responsible handling" based on? Is it encouraging Wu Yongshun's exposure? Or is it encouraging Chen Furong's mistakes?

    The Industrial Bureau Party Committee's serious mistakes are certainly not limited to this. In the spring of 1953, the Tianjin Municipal Committee's Industrial Department specially sent a work team to the Red Star Factory for more than a month, and afterwards compiled a detailed report on the problems of the Red Star Factory. The report described the seriously chaotic production situation of the Red Star Factory, and also exposed the facts of Chen Furong's serious errors in leadership ideology. The report pointed out that Chen Furong did not use both virtue and talent as the standard for selecting cadres, but used personal likes and dislikes as the standard; the report described Chen Furong's attacks and ostracism of veteran cadres, and the situation of re-using and relying on impure elements, and listed how bad elements controlled some workshops and production teams, and how they oppressed workers. Finally, the report emphasized that to solve the problems of the Red Star Factory, the first thing to do was to correct Chen Furong's erroneous leadership ideology, and the second thing to do was to conduct a thorough democratic re-education. This report was forwarded to the Industrial Bureau Party Committee in May 1953, instructing the Industrial Bureau Party Committee to be responsible for handling it and reporting the results to the Industrial Department. But what was the result? The report went and disappeared without a trace, and afterwards the Industrial Department repeatedly urged the Party Committee, but the Industrial Bureau Party Committee only sent a comrade from the office to understand the situation and that was it. The problems of the Red Star Factory continued to exist, and Chen Furong's mistakes continued to develop. From this examination of Chen Furong's mistakes, it was found that this report was neither circulated to all members of the Party Committee, nor discussed at the Industrial Bureau Party Committee meeting, and even the report itself disappeared without a trace. This cannot but make people ask this Party Committee: the Industrial Department's report described the situation of the Red Star Factory so concretely, analyzed the problems so pertinently, and proposed the solutions so clearly, but it was not handled. Where did the minimum responsibility of a Party organization for its work go? The Municipal Committee's Industrial Department is the superior organ of this Party Committee. It adopted such an indifferent attitude towards the opinions and instructions of the superior organ. Where did the minimum organizational discipline of a Party organization go? The Industrial Department's report listed the facts of the rampant behavior of bad elements in the Red Star Factory, but the Industrial Bureau Party Committee remained calm. Where did the minimum political vigilance of a Party organization go?

    The serious mistakes of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee are not limited to this. The comrades of the Red Star Factory Branch Committee and other comrades who had worked in the Red Star Factory had reported some of Chen Furong's mistakes to the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, although sporadically and on many occasions. However, the comrades of the Party Committee either did not listen carefully to all these reports, or did not analyze them carefully. In short, they were never able to recognize the serious nature of Chen Furong's mistakes. In August 1954, the Party Committee of the Local State-Owned Heavy Industry Bureau (formerly the Heavy Industry Section of the Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau, changed to the Bureau in July 1954) sent Li Qingliang to the Red Star Factory to do Party work. As soon as Li Qingliang went, he discovered Chen Furong's mistakes of discriminating against and ostracizing the Party organization. He immediately reported to Wang Jian, the Minister of Propaganda of the Heavy Industry Bureau Party Committee. But who could have imagined that the answer to him was not support, but criticism: "People have a set of things in production! You have only been in the factory for a few days, you should humbly learn from them!" The logic of this Minister of Propaganda of the Party Committee is indeed unexpected: Does this mean that as long as the factory director has a set of things in production, even if he discriminates against and ostracizes the Party organization, it doesn't matter, why report it! Does this mean that: to fight against a factory director who "has a set of things in production" but discriminates against and ostracizes the Party organization is not being humble but being arrogant? In September 1954, Li Qingliang once again systematically reported Chen Furong's main mistakes to the Party Committee, and pointed out that Chen Furong's mistakes were political degeneration. This time, the comrades of the Heavy Industry Bureau Party Committee finally completely agreed with Li Qingliang's analysis, but strangely, the Heavy Industry Bureau Party Committee still did not have the determination to seriously deal with this kind of degenerate element, but wanted the Red Star Factory Branch to educate and transform him. May I ask, entrusting such a large state-owned enterprise to a politically degenerate element to continue to manage, is this the responsible attitude that the Party organization should have towards the people's cause? For a factory director who discriminates against and ostracizes the factory's Party organization and has already degenerated politically, the leadership allows the Party organization of this factory to educate and transform him, is this the serious spirit that the Party organization should have in handling cadre mistakes? What is even stranger is: it is precisely this Red Star Factory where the bad elements are rampant and the workers are swallowing their anger, it is precisely this Red Star Factory managed by the politically degenerate element Chen Furong, that has been constantly praised by the Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau for several years. Until the third quarter award evaluation in October 1954, this factory was still awarded a prize flag, and publicized in newspapers and broadcasts!

    The Industrial Bureau Party Committee is the organ sent by the Party to the Industrial Bureau system to realize the Party's political and ideological leadership. Its main task is to implement political supervision over all administrative measures and economic activities in the Industrial Bureau system, and to struggle to ensure that all activities in this system fully comply with the Party's policies and principles, and fully comply with the fundamental interests of the Party and the country. However, in dealing with the problems of the Red Star Factory, this Party Committee was only satisfied with the formal development of the enterprise, only satisfied with the enterprise completing the production plan in numbers, and not only did it not actively examine the real situation of the Red Star Factory and Chen Furong from a political perspective, but even when someone reported to it how Chen Furong violated and undermined some of the Party's fundamental policies and principles, it still did not arouse its due vigilance. Doesn't this show that the Industrial Bureau Party Committee has completely forgotten its responsibility as a political leader and completely abandoned its role of political supervision? Doesn't this show that the Industrial Bureau Party Committee has committed the serious mistake of only paying attention to production and not asking about politics in the Red Star Factory issue?

    The serious mistakes of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee are not limited to these. Chen Furong's mistakes did not only occur and develop after he came to the Red Star Factory, but were consistent. However, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee neither understood nor investigated Chen Furong's history before coming to Tianjin, nor did it study and analyze Chen Furong's mistakes after coming to Tianjin. Therefore, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee has been blindly trusting him and using him wrongly. As a result, this degenerate element was able to repeat his mistakes again and again, and damage our cause again and again. From this examination of Chen Furong's mistakes, it was found that as early as 1939, just after Chen Furong joined the Party, he had been placed on probation within the Party for colluding with some village cadres to frame the village chief. Chen Furong originally joined the Party in 1939, but he had always filled in 1938 on his forms. Chen Furong originally started working in 1942, but he had always filled in 1938 on his forms. Chen Furong originally served as the caretaker platoon leader of the sanatorium in the army, but he had always filled in that he was the assistant of the field hospital on his forms. Even if these situations increased the difficulty of understanding due to the loss of Chen Furong's files before 1949, is it difficult to understand his situation after Chen Furong came to Tianjin in 1949 and has been working in the Industrial Bureau system? Just looking at Chen Furong's situation after coming to Tianjin to work is enough to prove his political depravity and degeneration. During his tenure as the branch secretary of the Hengda Flour Mill, Chen Furong supported the feudal foreman in preventing workers from joining the transport union, and accepted a banner from the feudal foreman with the words "You are the lighthouse." Although the leadership discovered this serious mistake relatively late, when Chen Furong had already been transferred to the Red Star Factory, the leadership did not conduct strict education on Chen Furong in response to this serious mistake, and did not fulfill the responsibilities of the Party organization. Another serious mistake made by Chen Furong during his work at the Hengda Flour Mill was colluding with cadres to attack the factory director, and was therefore given a warning by the Party. Then he was transferred away from the Hengda Flour Mill; but what is surprising is that Chen Furong, who had committed a political mistake, immediately received even greater political trust and was transferred to the larger Rubber General Factory to become the branch secretary. During his tenure at the Rubber General Factory, in order to compete with the factory director for power, Chen Furong constantly emphasized that "the branch should lead everything" and carried out factional activities of private patronage to oppose the factory director. However, what is puzzling is that Chen Furong, who had repeatedly committed political mistakes of the same nature, was not subject to any punishment by the Party this time. He was simply transferred away from the Rubber General Factory. If he had been transferred away from the Rubber General Factory and not given an equivalent position, that would have been fine, but it is said that the Party Committee considered at the time that Chen Furong was an old cadre! How to give him an appropriate placement! Then something even more surprising happened, this old cadre whose political qualities had repeatedly shown a lack of trustworthiness continued to be trusted by the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, and was allowed to take charge of the Red Star Factory. As a result, Chen Furong continued to make mistakes, but because he was the factory director, he turned his targets of ostracism and attack to the factory's branch and Party workers.

    Examining cadres from both political quality and professional ability, and first examining cadres from political quality, is a fundamental principle in our Party's cadre policy. Where does the CCP Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Committee place this principle in using and promoting Chen Furong in this way? Chen Furong's mistakes are of course the result of Chen Furong's bad political qualities and the development of bourgeois individualism, but can the leadership's inexplicable way of dealing with cadre mistakes not bear the responsibility of objectively contributing to and condoning?

    Just Chen Furong's performance during his work in Tianjin is enough to prove that Chen Furong has consistently lost his position, is unable to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and has consistently colluded with some people and ostracized others. When he is the branch secretary, he emphasizes that "the branch should lead everything" in the factory, and attacks the factory director; when he is the factory director, he excludes the Party's supervisory role over the enterprise and attacks the branch secretary. What a bad political quality, what a serious political mistake. Why didn't the Industrial Bureau Party Committee analyze and judge these performances in connection? Why did the Industrial Bureau Party Committee seem to forget the mistakes he made at the Hengda Flour Mill when assigning him to the Rubber General Factory, and then seemed to forget the mistakes he made at the Rubber General Factory when assigning him to the Red Star Factory, and then seemed to completely forget all the mistakes Chen Furong had made in the past when hearing about the mistakes Chen Furong had made at the Red Star Factory? How is this understanding cadres? Comprehensively and systematically examining cadres and appraising cadres is the main method for Party organizations to understand and select cadres. For cadres who have committed serious political mistakes, they cannot be allowed to give them the same trust before they have corrected their mistakes in the test of actual work, and of course, they cannot be allowed to give them greater trust. This is an important principle. What do the Industrial Bureau Party Committee's actions on Chen Furong have in common with this main method and important principle?

    Indeed, if it is said that the Industrial Bureau Party Committee has not completely handled the problems of the Red Star Factory and Chen Furong's mistakes, it is also inconsistent with the facts. After 1954, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee regarded the Red Star Factory as the focus in every movement, criticized Chen Furong's mistakes, and even the responsible comrades of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee personally presided over it, but each time Chen Furong's political degeneration was vaguely seen as the inability of the leadership core of the Red Star Factory to unite, and it was over as long as Chen Furong made a self-criticism. What a lack of principled views and practices!

    Indeed, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee did not think that Chen Furong was a good cadre with both virtue and talent, and also understood that Chen Furong had many problems in his ideological style, and had repeatedly planned to transfer Chen Furong away from the Red Star Factory, but what was the result? "There is no one more suitable!" Chen Furong was still the director of the Red Star Factory. Is it true that there is no talent to replace Chen Furong among the hundreds of factories under the Industrial Bureau? Or does the Party Committee only limit its vision of selecting cadres to a small circle of several old cadres, and not see the emerging forces that are growing up?

    It should be explained that the secretary, deputy secretary, and some members of the CCP Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Party Committee have been replaced several times in recent years, and they should each bear a certain responsibility for Chen Furong's mistakes. It should also be explained that since the "New Three-Anti" movement in 1953 criticized the serious tendency of the former local state-owned industrial bureau Party and government leaders to not ask about politics, the political and ideological leadership in the Industrial Bureau system has indeed been strengthened. However, it still made serious mistakes in dealing with the Red Star Factory incident, and still has to bear serious responsibility! Some achievements in work cannot offset the losses caused to the Party by the Red Star Factory incident.

    In order to seriously deal with the serious mistakes made by the Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Party Committee (including the Local State-Owned Heavy Industry Bureau Party Committee) regarding the Red Star Factory incident, the CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee convened the responsible comrades of the former Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Party Committee and the Local State-Owned Heavy Industry Bureau Party Committee to study the responsibilities that the Party Committee should bear, study the main lessons of the Red Star Factory incident, and the relevant comrades of these two Party Committees made separate self-criticisms. Finally, the CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee also conducted a special discussion on the Red Star Factory incident, approved the expulsion of Chen Furong from the Party, and made strict criticisms of the serious mistakes made by the Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Party Committee in this incident. At the same time, it pointed out that the Municipal Committee's Industrial Department also had a certain responsibility for not taking more active steps to solve the problems of the Red Star Factory. In order to learn lessons, educate cadres, and further improve the leadership level of Party organizations, the Municipal Committee also made a decision on the problems of the Local State-Owned Red Star Factory, and took the Red Star Factory incident as a typical case for Party organizations at all levels to universally study and discuss.

    Although the Red Star Factory incident occurred in Tianjin, the lessons it gives us are of universal significance. Don't we often encounter phenomena such as some of our Party organizations not regularly going deep into the lower levels, not humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, not resolutely implementing the instructions of higher authorities, not being good at carrying out political and ideological work, not being good at handling problems according to Party principles and policies, not comprehensively understanding their own cadres, not seriously dealing with cadre mistakes, and continuing to re-use cadres who have committed serious mistakes, etc.? Therefore, not only the Party organizations and cadres in Tianjin, but also the Party organizations and cadres in various places need to learn lessons from the Chen Furong incident and improve their work.

    从红星工厂事件看中共天津市地方国营工业局委员会的责任
    胡琦　力峰
    天津市曾经有过这样一个工厂，在这个工厂中，有资本家坐探，有一贯道点传师，有国民党兵痞，有国民党区分部委员，还有封建把头。所有这些形形色色的反动分子，取得了一贯主张“不管黑猫白猫能逮住老鼠就是好猫”和一贯宣称“谁靠近我就是好人、不听我的话就要倒霉”的厂长的信任，被大批提拔为生产组长以至科长和车间主任。于是反动分子就掌握了这个工厂的若干部门，公开辱骂共产党和人民政府，公开排挤打击共产党员、青年团员和积极分子，任意欺压工人，体罚工人，克扣工人工资，侮辱女工。
    在这个工厂中，厂长不断散布“谁要作行政工作，谁就不重视党的工作”，“支书不是跟着厂长跑，就是找厂长的毛病闹不团结”等等谬论，厂长处处限制支部的活动，使支部不能独立地进行政治思想工作。支部整理教材，要对职工进行政治思想教育，他反对，只好作罢。支部根据上级党委指示领导党小组制订竞赛保证条件，他也反对，也没有订成。支部干事下车间了解生产情况，都要受到厂长的干涉，他宣布“党了解生产情况必须通过厂长”。支部书记刘凯，因坚持党的原则向他进行斗争，他就想尽一切办法，打击刘凯，使刘凯无法工作。
    在这个工厂中，厂长借口本厂情况特殊，可以不执行上级的指示，可以抗拒上级的检查。很多去这个工厂了解和帮助工作的同志，受到的不是欢迎而是冷遇，往往完不成任务就被迫而归。
    在这个工厂中，生产管理没制度，科室工作也没制度，没有操作规程，没有检验标准，生产材料浪费很大，产品质量非常低劣，生产计划极为保守。
    这个工厂就是不久之前才彻底进行了民主补课的天津市地方国营红星工厂，这个工厂的厂长就是最近被中共天津市委会批准开除党籍并被撤销厂长职务的陈福荣。这次在天津市委的领导下所进行的民主补课中，发动职工向压在他们头上的十四名反动分子进行了斗争，并根据罪恶大小分别作了处理，逮捕法办的四名，开除厂籍的三名，经教育后留用的七名（其中三人撤销科长职务）。
    红星工厂的问题过去所以长期不能解决，直接领导红星工厂党组织的中共天津市地方国营工业局委员会要负重大责任。红星工厂的问题如此严重，陈福荣的政治品质如此恶劣，中共天津市地方国营工业局委员会（下称工业局党委会）为什么不能及早发现和处理呢？这不是说明这个党委会犯了严重的官僚主义错误吗？不，如果党委会对红星工厂的问题和陈福荣的错误确实很少知道，那可以说是严重的官僚主义，可是我们只要看看以下事实，就不能认为工业局党委会的错误仅仅限于严重的官僚主义了！
    远在一九五二年的十一月，当时担任红星工厂副厂长的吴永顺就曾给天津市委工业部写信揭露过陈福荣在干部政策上的私人拉拢毫无原则的严重错误。这封信的内容，市委工业部曾经向工业局党委会转述过，要工业局党委会负责处理。可是结果怎样呢？陈福荣的错误还是依然如故，而揭露陈福荣错误的吴永顺倒被调走了。当然，调走吴永顺的理由可以冠冕堂皇：“工作需要”，而陈福荣却夸口：“吴永顺是我到局里给嘀咕走的。”此中道理不是显而易见吗？试问这样的“负责处理”是根据党的那一项原则呢？是鼓励吴永顺的揭发呢？还是鼓励陈福荣的错误呢？
    工业局党委会的严重错误当然不只这一点。一九五三年春，天津市委工业部专门派了一个工作组到红星工厂住了一个多月，事后曾经整理了一个关于红星工厂问题的详细材料。材料中叙述了红星工厂生产上严重混乱的情况，也揭露了陈福荣领导思想上的严重错误的事实。材料中指出陈福荣不以德才兼备而以个人好恶为取舍干部的标准；材料中叙述了陈福荣打击和排挤老干部的情况，重用和依靠不纯分子的情况，并列举了坏分子如何把持部分车间和生产小组，如何欺压工人的情况。材料最后还着重指出，要解决红星工厂的问题，首先必须纠正陈福荣错误的领导思想，其次就要进行一次彻底的民主补课。这份材料于一九五三年五月转给了工业局党委会，责成工业局党委会负责处理并将结果报告工业部。可是结果又怎样呢？材料一去，就如石沉大海，以后工业部尽管催问多次，工业局党委会只派过办公室一个同志去了解了一下情况就算了事。红星工厂的问题继续存在，陈福荣的错误继续发展。从这次对陈福荣错误的检查中发现，这份材料既没有给全体党委委员传阅，也没有在工业局党委会上讨论，连材料本身都无影无踪了。这就使人不能不向这个党委会发问：工业部的材料中把红星工厂的情况叙述得如此具体，问题分析得如此中肯，解决办法提得如此明确，竟不处理，作为一个党组织对工作的起码责任感到那里去了呢？市委工业部是这个党委会的上级机关，对上级机关的意见和指示采取如此漠视的态度，作为一个党组织的起码的组织性和纪律性到那里去了呢？工业部的材料中列举了坏分子在红星工厂横行霸道的事实，工业局党委会竟泰然处之，作为一个党组织的起码的政治警惕性到那里去了呢？
    工业局党委会严重的错误还不限于此。红星工厂支部委员会的同志以及其他到红星工厂工作过的同志，虽是零星地但是多次地向工业局党委会反映过陈福荣的一些错误，可是党委会的同志对所有这些反映不是没有仔细听取，就是没有认真分析，总之始终不能认识陈福荣错误的严重性质。到一九五四年八月，地方国营重工业局（原地方国营工业局重工业处，一九五四年七月改成局）党委会派李清亮到红星工厂作党的工作，李清亮一去就发觉陈福荣歧视和排挤党组织的错误，他马上就向重工业局党委会的宣传部长王坚反映，可是谁能想到回答他的不是支持，而是指责：“人家生产上有一套哩！你才到厂几天，应该虚心向人家学习！”这位党委宣传部长的逻辑的确出人意料：这是不是说只要生产上有一套的厂长，即使歧视和排挤党的组织也不算什么，何必反映！这是不是说：向歧视和排挤党组织的“生产上有一套”的厂长进行斗争就不是虚心而是骄傲？一九五四年九月间，李清亮又一次向党委会系统地反映了陈福荣的主要错误，并指出陈福荣的错误是政治上的蜕化。重工业局党委会的同志这次总算完全同意了李清亮的分析，但奇怪的是重工业局党委会仍然没有决心对这种蜕化分子进行严肃处理，而是要红星工厂支部去教育和改造他。试问，把偌大的国家企业，委托给一个政治上的蜕化分子继续管理，这是党组织对人民的事业应有的负责态度吗？对一个歧视和排挤工厂党组织的政治上已经蜕化的厂长，领导上却让这个工厂的党组织去教育和改造他，这是党组织处理干部错误应有的严肃精神吗？更奇怪的是：正是这个坏分子飞扬跋扈，工人们忍气吞声的红星工厂，正是这个被政治上的蜕化分子陈福荣管理的红星工厂，几年来曾经不断受到地方国营工业局的表扬，直到一九五四年十月第三季度评奖时，这个工厂还得了奖旗，并登报和广播进行宣传！
    工业局党委会是党派到工业局系统中实现党的政治思想领导的机关，它的主要任务是对工业局系统中的全部行政措施和经济活动实行政治上的监督，为保证这个系统中的一切活动完全符合党的方针政策，完全符合党和国家的根本利益而斗争。但是这个党委会在对待红星工厂的问题上仅仅满足于企业从形式上有了发展，仅仅满足于企业在数目字上完成了生产计划，不但没有主动地从政治上考察红星工厂和陈福荣的真实情况，甚至当有人向它反映了陈福荣如何违反和破坏党的一些根本政策和原则时，依然引不起它的应有警惕，这不是说明工业局党委会根本忘记了自己作为政治领导者的责任，完全抛弃了自己政治监督的作用吗？这不是说明工业局党委会在红星工厂问题上犯了只管生产不问政治的严重错误吗？
    工业局党委会的严重错误还不限于这些。陈福荣的错误并不是到红星工厂以后才发生和发展的，而是带一贯性的。可是工业局党委会对陈福荣来天津以前的历史既没有进行了解和考察，而对陈福荣来天津以后的错误又缺乏研究和分析。因此工业局党委会就一直在盲目地信任他，一直在错误地使用他。以致使这个蜕化分子得以一次又一次地重复自己的错误，一次又一次地损害我们的事业。从这次检查陈福荣的错误中发现，远在一九三九年陈福荣刚刚入党之后，他就曾因为拉拢一部分村干部诬陷村长而受了留党察看的处分。陈福荣本来是一九三九年入党的，而他过去在表上一直填的是一九三八年，陈福荣本来是一九四二年参加工作的，而他在表上却一贯填的是一九三八年。陈福荣在部队上本来担任休养所的照护排长，而他在表上却一向填成野战医院的协理员。就算这些情况由于陈福荣一九四九年以前的档案材料的丢失增加了了解的困难，那么一九四九年陈福荣来天津以后一直在工业局系统中工作，了解他的情况也有困难吗？仅仅就陈福荣来天津工作以后的情况看，也足够证明他政治上的堕落和蜕化了。陈福荣在恒大面粉厂担任支部书记期间，就曾支持封建把头不让工人参加搬运工会，并接受了封建把头送他的一面“你是灯塔”的锦旗。这一严重错误领导上发现虽然较晚，当时陈福荣已调红星工厂，但是领导上没有针对这一严重错误对陈福荣进行严格教育，是没有尽到党组织的责任的。陈福荣在恒大面粉厂工作期间的另一严重错误就是拉拢干部打击厂长，并因此受了党的劝告处分。接着就被调离恒大面粉厂；但是令人吃惊的是，这个犯了政治性错误的陈福荣马上又得到了政治上更大的信任，被调到规模更大的橡胶总厂当起支部书记来了。陈福荣在橡胶总厂工作期间为了和厂长争夺权力，就不断强调“支部应该领导一切”，并进行私人拉拢的宗派活动来反对厂长，但是令人不解的是，屡犯同一性质政治错误的陈福荣，这次反而没有受到党的任何处分，仅仅调离橡胶总厂就算了事。如果调离橡胶总厂，不给陈福荣同等的职务那也罢了，可是据说，当时党委会考虑，陈福荣是个老干部呀！怎样给他一个适当的安置呢！于是令人更加吃惊的事发生了，这个政治品质屡次表现不足信任的老干部，继续受到工业局党委会的信任，又让他独当一面，去管理红星工厂了。于是陈福荣又继续犯起错误来，不过因为他当的是厂长，就把他排挤和打击的对象转到工厂的支部和党的工作人员身上了。
    从政治品质和业务能力两方面考察干部，而且首先从政治品质方面考察干部，是我们党的干部政策中的一项根本原则，中共天津市地方国营工业局委员会对陈福荣如此使用和提拔，将把这项原则置于何地呢？陈福荣的错误当然是陈福荣的政治品质恶劣和资产阶级个人主义发展的结果，但是领导上这种莫名其妙地处理干部错误的办法，能够不负在客观上助长和放纵的责任吗？
    仅仅就陈福荣在天津这一段工作中的表现，已经充分证明陈福荣是一贯地丧失立场，敌我不分，是一贯地拉拢一些人，排挤另一些人，他当支部书记，就强调工厂里的“支部应该领导一切”，打击厂长；他当厂长，就排斥党对企业的监督作用，打击支部书记。这是何等恶劣的政治品质，多么严重的政治错误。工业局党委会为什么不把这些表现联系起来分析判断呢？工业局党委会为什么分配他到橡胶总厂时好像忘了他在恒大面粉厂犯的错误，分配他到红星工厂时又好像忘了他在橡胶总厂犯的错误，而当听到陈福荣在红星工厂所犯的错误时，又好像完全忘记了陈福荣过去所犯的一切错误，这是怎样了解干部的呢？全面地系统地考察干部，鉴定干部，是党组织了解和选拔干部的主要方法。对政治上犯了严重错误的干部，当他们没有在实际工作的考验中改正了自己的错误以前，不能容许给他们同等的信任，当然更不能容许给他们更大的信任，这是一项重要原则。而工业局党委会在对待陈福荣的问题上与这种主要方法和重要原则有何共同之处呢？
    的确，如果说工业局党委会完全没有处理过红星工厂的问题和陈福荣的错误，那也是不合乎事实的。一九五四年以后，工业局党委会在每次运动中都把红星工厂作为重点，批判陈福荣的错误，甚至由工业局党委会的负责同志亲自主持，但是每次都把陈福荣政治上的蜕化，模棱两可地看成红星工厂领导核心不能团结，只要陈福荣作一次检讨就算完事。这是多么缺乏原则的看法和作法啊！
    的确，工业局党委会也不曾认为陈福荣是德才兼备的好干部，也了解陈福荣在思想作风上有不少毛病，也曾经多次打算把陈福荣从红星工厂调开，但是结果呢？“没有更适合的人啊！”陈福荣一直还是红星工厂的厂长。难道在工业局所属上百个工厂中真的就没有顶替陈福荣的人材吗？还是党委会只是把自己选拔干部的眼界仅仅限于若干个老干部的小圈子，看不到成长中的新生力量呢？
    应该说明，几年来中共天津市地方国营工业局党委会的书记、副书记和部分委员已经有过几次更换，对陈福荣的错误，他们都要分别担负一定的责任。还应该说明，从一九五三年“新三反”运动中批判了以前地方国营工业局党政领导上不问政治的严重倾向以后，工业局系统中的政治思想领导确实有所加强。但是，在对待红星工厂事件上它仍然犯了严重错误，仍然要担负严重责任！工作上的某些成绩不能够抵偿在红星工厂事件上给党造成的损失。
    为了严肃处理地方国营工业局党委会（包括地方国营重工业局党委会）对红星工厂事件所犯的严重错误，中共天津市委会曾召集前地方国营工业局党委会和地方国营重工业局党委会的负责同志，研究党委会应负的责任，研究红星工厂事件的主要教训，并由这两个党委会的有关同志分别作了检讨。最后，中共天津市委会也对红星工厂事件作了专题讨论，批准开除陈福荣的党籍，对地方国营工业局党委会在这一事件上所犯的严重错误作了严格的批评，同时指出市委工业部没有采取更积极的步骤解决红星工厂的问题也有一定的责任。为了接受教训，教育干部，进一步提高党组织的领导水平，市委会还作了关于地方国营红星工厂问题的决定，并把红星工厂事件作为典型要各级党组织普遍进行学习讨论。
    红星工厂事件虽然发生在天津，但是它给我们的教训是有普遍意义的。我们有些党组织不经常深入下层，不虚心倾听群众意见，不坚决执行上级指示，不善于进行政治思想工作，不善于根据党的原则和政策处理问题，不全面了解自己的干部，不严肃处理干部的错误，以及对犯了严重错误的干部继续重用等等现象不是经常可以碰到的吗？因此，不仅是天津市的党组织和干部，各地的党组织和干部都有必要从陈福荣事件中吸取教训，改进工作。
