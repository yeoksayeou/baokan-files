    Anshan Iron and Steel Exceeds February Production Plan

    On the basis of overfulfilling the January production plan, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company achieved new successes in February, with all sixteen major products exceeding the national production plan.

    In February, the production enthusiasm of workers in many factories and mines was high under the call to oppose the use of atomic weapons and support the liberation of Taiwan, enabling the plan to be overfulfilled. Since signing their names, the youth group workers of the steel rope factory have overfulfilled their work plan every day, completing the monthly plan ahead of schedule on the 23rd and exceeding it by 14.6 percent. The workers of the medium-sized mill not only overfulfilled the February production plan, but also improved the quality by 0.26 percent compared with the plan. The hourly steel rolling capacity also increased by 9.15 percent compared with the plan, and they set new hourly records and new roll changing records five times in a row.

    鞍钢超额完成二月份生产计划
    鞍山钢铁公司的职工在超额完成一月份生产计划的基础上，二月份又获得了新成就，十六种主要产品已全部超额完成国家生产计划。
    二月里，许多厂矿的职工在反对使用原子武器和支援解放台湾的号召下，生产热情高涨，使计划得以超额完成。钢绳厂青年组工人自从签名后，每天都超额完成作业计划，在二十三日就提前并超额百分之十四点六完成了月计划。中型厂职工不仅超额完成二月份生产计划，质量还比计划提高百分之零点二六，每小时轧钢能力也比计划提高百分之九点一五，并连创小时新纪录和换辊新纪录五次。
