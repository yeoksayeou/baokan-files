	Wasting Food is Shameful
	Kang Zhong
	"One bowl of porridge, one grain of rice, think of how hard it was to come by," is an old saying, a profound and educational saying. It tells us to cherish the labor of farmers and to save food at all times and in all places.

	Some cadres and employees in state organs, enterprises, organizations, and schools do not understand this saying. They carelessly squander and waste food. Some units do not collect food from the state according to their needs, but instead adopt methods such as falsely reporting and fraudulently claiming state food. Several units under the Hengyang Railway Sub-bureau of Guangxi Province falsely reported a population of 10,226 grain recipients, purchasing an excess of 280,000 jin of state grain, between July and December of last year alone. The Eighth Engineering Bureau of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, falsely reported 1,572 employees, purchasing an excess of 36,156 jin of flour, between October and November of last year.

	Some units buy too much grain, and when they cannot finish it, they casually resell it and barter for other things, or waste it wantonly. The Handan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Hebei Province privately resold eighty jin of millet to the raw cotton management department, and the knitting factory exchanged three hundred jin of soybeans for tofu. Tang Dengxiu, a family member of an employee of the Hengyang Railway Sub-bureau's epidemic prevention station, sold sixty jin of rice to nearby residents. Some workers at the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in Handan City, Hebei Province, took a couple of bites of a steamed bun and threw it away, or left half a bowl of rice uneaten. On December 8th of last year alone, 470 jin of leftover steamed buns and rice were collected from the dining tables. These phenomena deserve our attention.

	Wasting food is an intolerable and shameful act. Farmers work hard to produce grain and try their best to save it, selling the surplus grain to the state to support the country's socialist industrialization, making a glorious contribution to the country. What reason does any unit or any person have to despise the labor of farmers and squander state grain in this way?

	Some people say: "My money is earned through labor, and the food I eat is bought with my own money. I can waste it if I want, it's none of your business." Anyone can see the error of this statement at a glance. This bourgeois-style, ostentatious, and extravagant behavior will not add any glory to them; on the contrary, it will only arouse the contempt and indignation of the broad masses of ordinary people.

	There is also a saying: "There is plenty of grain, wasting a little doesn't matter." This is very wrong. Waste starts from small things, and wasting even a little is wrong. "Trickles of water form a mighty river." Currently, there are approximately 100 million people in cities. If each person wastes just one or two liang of grain per day, the state can reduce its expenditure by more than 2 billion jin of grain per year. This is a huge number!

	There are many ways to save grain, which will not be discussed in detail here. It should be pointed out that the thorough implementation of any method of saving grain must start with strengthening education on saving grain. An atmosphere and public opinion should be formed in urban organs, organizations, troops, factories, schools, and residents, and in the vast rural areas: we must save grain, and wasting grain is shameful!

### 浪费粮食是可耻的

    浪费粮食是可耻的
    康重
    “一粥一饭当思来处不易”，这是一句古话，一句意味深长、富有教育意义的话。它要我们珍重农民的劳动，随时随地节约粮食。
    有些国家机关、企业、团体、学校中的干部和职工，并不懂得这句话。他们竟随便糟蹋和浪费粮食。有些单位不按照需要向国家领取粮食，而是采取虚报、冒领等办法购用国家的粮食。广西省衡阳铁路分局所属几个单位，仅在去年七月到十二月，就虚报领粮人口一万零二百二十六人，多购国家粮食二十八万斤。山西省太原市第八工程局在去年十月到十一月，虚报职工一千五百七十二人，多购面粉三万六千一百五十六斤。
    有些单位买的粮食太多，自己吃不完，就随便转卖和换买东西，或肆意浪费。河北邯郸市供销合作社私自把八十斤小米转卖给原棉经理部，针织厂把积存的三百斤黄豆换了豆腐。衡阳市铁路分局防疫站职工家属唐登秀，先后卖六十斤米给附近居民。河北邯郸市第一棉纺织厂有的工人把馒头咬两口就扔掉了，大米饭剩半碗就不吃了，仅在去年十二月八日那天，从饭桌上搜集到的剩馒头和剩饭就有四百七十斤。这种现象，都值得我们注意。
    浪费粮食是一种不能容忍的、可耻的行为。农民辛辛苦苦地生产粮食，并且尽量节省，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家社会主义工业化建设，对国家作了光荣的贡献。任何单位，任何人员，有什么理由这样轻视农民的劳动，糟蹋国家的粮食呢？
    有一种人说：“我的钱是劳动换来的，我吃的粮食是用自己的钱买来的，我糟蹋，你管不着。”这种说法的错误，任何人一眼都能看得出来。这种资产阶级老爷式的讲排场、耍阔气的作法，绝不会给他们增加任何的光采；恰恰相反，它只能引起广大普通人的卑视和义愤。
    还有一种说法：“粮食多得很，浪费一点没有啥。”这是非常错误的。浪费是从小处开始的，浪费一点都是不对的。“涓涓之水，汇成巨流”，目前城市有一亿左右人口，如果每人每天少浪费一两粮食，国家每年就能少支出二十亿斤以上的粮食。这是一个多么巨大的数字！
    节约粮食的办法是很多的，这里不来一一论述，应该指出：任何节约粮食的办法的彻底实行，都要从加强节约粮食的教育做起。应该在城市的机关、团体、部队、工厂、学校和居民中，在广大的农村中形成一种空气，一种舆论：必须节约粮食，浪费粮食是可耻的！
