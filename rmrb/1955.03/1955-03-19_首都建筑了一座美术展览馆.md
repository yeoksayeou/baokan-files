    An Art Exhibition Hall Built in the Capital
    A new art exhibition hall in the capital has been completed on March 15th and handed over to the Chinese Artists Association.
    Construction of the art exhibition hall began in September 1954. It has three floors and five exhibition halls, with a total exhibition area of 1,100 square meters. Above the entrance of the exhibition hall is a large relief sculpture, 16.7 meters long, created by teachers and students of the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts.
    In recent years, various public art exhibitions and observation exhibitions have been increasing. In 1954, there were 27 art exhibitions held in Beijing. Therefore, the Chinese Artists Association decided to build this exhibition hall as a place for regular exhibitions. The photography art exhibition to be held in late April will be held here.

    首都建筑了一座美术展览馆
    首都新建的一座美术展览馆，已在三月十五日完工，移交给中国美术家协会。
    美术展览馆在一九五四年九月开始兴建，高三层，分五个展览厅，展览面积共有一千一百平方公尺。在展览馆大门上面：有一幅中央美术学院雕塑系师生创作的、长十六点七公尺的大浮雕。
    近几年来，各种美术公开展览或观摩展览日益增多。一九五四年在北京举行的各种美术展览就有二十七次。因此中国美术家协会决定兴建这座展览馆，作为经常展览的地方。准备在四月下旬举行的摄影艺术展览会就要在这里举行。　（新华社）
