    Nanchang City is Resettling Farmers Whose Land Was Expropriated

    Letter from the Nanchang Municipal People's Government: The People's Daily's criticism of the city's failure to properly resettle farmers whose land was expropriated is correct. After seeing this criticism, the Urban Construction Committee, the Real Estate Management Bureau, and other units immediately held a special meeting for discussion and research. We plan to resolve the resettlement of farmers whose land was expropriated in the following ways: depending on the specific circumstances, the units that expropriated the land will absorb some farmers into the workforce as much as possible, or the labor department will assist them in changing careers. According to the city's situation, converting some paddy fields into vegetable fields is a good way to help farmers in the suburbs whose land was expropriated to continue production. We plan to start investigation and research work immediately to quickly propose specific measures to solve the problem.

    Suzhou Electrical Company Accepts Criticism and Corrects Mistakes

    Letter from Suzhou Electrical Company: The exposure of the company's serious waste phenomenon in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on January 16th is completely correct. Now we have recognized our mistakes and initially corrected this phenomenon. For example, we have established methods for employing temporary workers and regulations for the operation of motor vehicles, which has reduced waste. The original allocation of four liang of tea per worker per month has now been reduced to two liang per worker per month. In the past, the lost quilts and flashlights for night shift workers have also been inventoried and recovered. These past wasteful and lax phenomena show that the company's leading cadres were indifferent to the wealth of the state and the people. In the future, we are determined to learn from our mistakes and correct them. Some corrupt and derelict individuals have also been seriously dealt with.

    Fengtai Vehicle Depot Builds Drainage Ditch

    Letter from Beijing Railway Administration: Our Fengtai Vehicle Depot discharged a large amount of wastewater into the Zhengyang Street open ditch in this town, which affected the people's hygiene and health. Now we have built a drainage culvert within the railway boundary of the Fengtai Vehicle Depot, and the drainage holes that originally flowed into the street have also been blocked up.

    Beijing's Drug Fee Standards are Being Improved

    Letter from the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau: The opinion raised by Comrade Lu Xiang in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on January 30th regarding the inconsistency in drug fees charged by various public and private medical institutions in Beijing is very correct. The reason for the inconsistency in drug prices in the hospitals under our bureau is mainly due to the serious shortcomings in the unified fee standard we set in June 1953. Our regulations on fee standards were not specific enough, with large flexibility, and some calculation methods were not unified. In particular, no special provisions were made for drugs with low value and large dosages, which caused differences in the prices of certain drugs and increased the burden on patients. The phenomenon of inconsistent drug prices is even more serious in private hospitals and clinics in the city. In February 1953, the Beijing Medical Association (now renamed Health Association) Physician's Association studied and proposed a fee standard and put it into trial implementation in March. Because the regulations were extremely general and very flexible, some private practitioners charged as much as they could. We believe this is a problem worthy of attention.

    Hospitals are social welfare undertakings that serve the broad masses of the people, and the above problems not only have a very bad impact on the masses, but also increase the economic burden on patients, which must be corrected. In May and June 1954, based on the feedback from the masses, our bureau repeatedly studied and discussed the original fee standards. In addition to temporarily instructing the medical units under our bureau to appropriately lower the prices of certain drugs in the regulations that may result in high fees, appropriate revisions were made to the regulations that were not specific, calculation methods were inconsistent, and some drugs that may result in high fees. In November 1954, we reported to the higher-level leading departments for verification. After approval and implementation, the phenomenon of inconsistent drug fees can be basically resolved. For the fee standards in private hospitals and clinics, in addition to guiding the Beijing Health Association Physician's Association to conduct further research and propose more specific methods, we also plan to strengthen the supervision and management of private practitioners to overcome certain improper charging behaviors.

    △ The CPC Mi County Committee of Henan Province wrote that, regarding the spontaneous transfer of Chen Fujie's group to the cooperative (original article published in the "Reader's Letters" page on January 16th), the CPC Tenth District Committee of Mi County did indeed have serious bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles, and some district committee members and cadres also had sectarian sentiments. For this reason, the county party committee has ordered the Tenth District Committee to conduct a review, and has given appropriate punishment to Li Dezhi, the district committee member, and Li Wanshun, the district cadre, and admitted their mistakes to the masses. At the same time, Chen Fujie's cooperative has been approved. Regarding this issue, the Mi County Committee also reviewed the bureaucratism in the county committee's leadership.

    △ After the People's Daily published Comrade Zhang Fu of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Transportation's criticism of "An 'Automobile Driver' Without a Driver's License" on January 30th, Shi Bin, the manager of the Jixi Hengshan Well Construction Company in Heilongjiang Province, not only reviewed his mistakes in repeatedly violating traffic laws and guaranteed that he would never commit them again and resolutely abide by all government laws, but also made a written review to the local government and the party organization of his unit and paid the maximum fine.

    △ The Construction Section of the Changge County People's Government of Henan Province wrote: After seeing the letter of criticism "A Strange Toy" published in the "Reader's Letters" page on November 14, 1954, we started to check it. Now, in addition to persuading the Zengfumiao Agricultural Production Cooperative to repair this straw cutter and continue to use it, our section has also learned a lesson from this and guarantees that we will do a good job in the safekeeping and promotion of new agricultural tools in the future.

    △ After the People's Daily published the critique "Wujin County Fishermen's Association Not Working" written by Comrade Zhu Shanqing of the Wujin County Committee Production Cooperation Department in the "Reader's Letters" page on January 23rd, the CPC Wujin County Committee conducted an inspection and research and initially decided on methods to strengthen the leadership of the Fishermen's Association: assigning the County Committee Production Cooperation Department to take specific responsibility for leadership, strengthening the connection between the Party and the fishermen through regularly convening meetings of fishermen representatives and meetings of the Fishermen's Association Committee; and instructing the Party branches and governments of various townships and relevant departments to pay attention to the leadership and support of fishermen, to promptly solve the practical problems of fishermen, and especially to pay attention to actively and steadily developing fishery production mutual aid and cooperation organizations among fishermen to help fishermen gradually get rid of poverty and embark on the road to collective prosperity.

### 批评建议的反应

专栏：批评建议的反应

    南昌市正在安置被征用土地的农民
    南昌市人民政府来信：人民日报对本市征用农民土地未予适当安置问题所提出批评是对的。我们见到这一批评后，城市建设委员会房地产管理局等单位，即共同开会进行了专门的讨论和研究，我们准备以如下办法解决被征用土地农民的安置问题，即根据具体情况，尽可能分别由征用土地的单位吸收一部分农民参加工作，或者由劳动部门协助他们转业。根据本市情况，将一部分稻田改种蔬菜是帮助郊区被征用土地农民继续生产的好办法，我们准备马上着手调查研究工作，以迅速提出解决问题的具体措施。
    苏州电气公司接受批评改正错误
    苏州电气公司来信：一月十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”揭发本公司的严重浪费现象是完全正确的。现在我们已认识错误，初步纠正了这种现象。例如：建立了雇用临时工办法和规定机动车的行驶制度，减少了浪费；原来每月发给工人每人四两茶叶，现在减为每人每月二两；过去失散了的供夜班工作人员用的棉被、电筒也已清点收缴回来。过去这些浪费和松散现象，说明公司领导干部对国家人民的财富漠不关心。今后我们决心接受教训，改正错误；对一些贪污失职分子也已予以严肃处理。
    丰台车辆段修建了排水沟
    北京铁路管理局来信：我局丰台车辆段将大量废水排入这个镇的正阳街明沟内，影响了人民的卫生和健康，现在我们已在丰台车辆段铁路界内修筑了一条排水暗沟，原来流向街道的排水孔也堵塞起来了。
    北京市的药品收费标准在改进中
    北京市人民政府公共卫生局来信：一月三十日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载的陆湘同志对北京市各公私立医疗机构药品收费不一致提出的意见，是十分正确的。在我局所属的医院中，所以存在着药品收费价格不统一的现象，主要是由于我们在一九五三年六月份所规定的统一收费标准有着严重的缺点。我们对于收费标准规定得不够具体，伸缩性较大，某些计算方法没有统一规定；特别是对于价值低而服用量大的药品没有作特殊规定，造成了某些药品收费价格上的差别，加重了患者的负担。药品收费价格不统一的现象在本市私立医院、诊所里更加严重。一九五三年二月，北京市医联（现改为卫协）医师会曾研究提出了一个收费标准，并于三月份试行。因为规定得极为笼统，伸缩性很大，以致造成有些私人开业医师能多收就多收，我们认为这是值得注意的问题。
    医院是为广大人民群众服务的社会福利事业，而上述问题不仅在群众中造成很不好的影响，也增加了病人经济上的负担，这是必须加以纠正的。一九五四年五、六月间，我局根据群众的反映，对原订的收费标准曾作过反复的研究和讨论，除对规定中某些可能产生收费偏高现象的药品临时指示我局所属医疗单位作适当降低外，对于规定中不具体、计算方法不一致和一些可能产生偏高现象的药品均作了适当修正，并于一九五四年十一月报请上级领导部门核示，俟批准实行后，药品收费不一致的现象基本上可以得到解决。对于私立医院、诊所中的收费标准，我们除指导北京市卫协医师会作进一步的研究并提出比较具体的办法外，还准备加强对私人开业医师的监督管理工作，克服某些不正当的收费行为。
    △中共河南省密县委员会来信说，在对待陈福杰组自发转社的问题上（原件载一月十六日“读者来信专页”），中共密县第十区委员会确实存在着严重的官僚主义和主观主义作风，并且个别区委和区干部还有宗派情绪。为此，县委已责成十区委作检查，对区委李德治、区干部李万顺作适当处分，向群众承认错误。同时，已批准陈福杰社。对于这个问题，密县县委还检讨了县委领导上的官僚主义。
    △本报于一月三十日发表黑龙江省交通厅张夫同志批评“一个没有汽车执照的‘汽车驾驶员’”后，黑龙江省鸡西恒山建井公司经理施斌除检讨了自己一再违犯交通法令的错误，保证今后决不再犯，坚决遵守政府一切法令外，并向当地政府和所在机关的党组织作出书面检讨和缴纳了最高罚款。
    △河南长葛县人民政府建设科来信：看到一九五四年十一月十四日“读者来信专页”刊载了“一件奇怪的玩具”的批评信后，我们就着手检查，现在除劝说增福庙农业生产合作社修理这部铡草机继续使用外，我们科内也接受了这一教训，保证今后作好新农具的保管和推广工作。
    △本报于一月二十三日“读者来信专页”中发表了武进县委生产合作部朱善卿同志所写“武进县渔民协会不起作用”的批评稿后，中共武进县委进行了检查研究，初步决定了加强渔民协会工作领导的办法：责成县委生产合作部具体负责领导，通过定期的召开渔民代表会议、渔民协会委员会议，密切党与渔民的联系；并交代各乡党支部、乡政府及有关部门注意对渔民的领导与支持，及时的解决渔民中切身问题，特别是注意在渔民中积极稳步地发展渔业生产互助合作组织，帮助渔民逐步摆脱贫困，走上集体富裕的道路。
