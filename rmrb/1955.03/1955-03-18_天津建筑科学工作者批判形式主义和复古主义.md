    Tianjin Architectural Science Workers Criticize Formalism and Revivalism
    The Tianjin Branch of the Architectural Society of China has begun to criticize bourgeois formalist tendencies and revivalist ideas in architectural design among its members. Since February, architectural science workers in Tianjin have been studying Khrushchev's speech at the All-Union Conference of Construction Workers and related documents in light of their actual work, and have organized discussions. Engineers at the Tianjin Architectural Design Company, in their discussions, examined and criticized incorrect ideas such as failing to attach importance to the use of standard drawings, standard components, and the reuse of drawings. The engineers also discussed the design of four sanatorium buildings in the Liulin Sanatorium area. In the design of this project, due to the design engineers' lack of a correct understanding of "national form," they mechanically imitated ancient architectural forms, one-sidedly pursued the "outlines" and surface decoration of buildings, and failed to implement the policy of practicality, economy, and appropriate attention to aesthetics under possible conditions, resulting in serious waste.

    天津建筑科学工作者批判形式主义和复古主义
    中国建筑学会天津分会在会员中开始批判建筑设计中的资产阶级形式主义倾向和复古主义思想。天津市的建筑科学工作者从二月开始，结合实际工作，学习了赫鲁晓夫在全苏建筑工作人员会议上的讲话和有关文件，并组织了讨论。天津市建筑设计公司的工程师们，在讨论中检查和批判了不重视采用标准图、标准构件和重复使用图纸等不正确思想。工程师们还讨论了柳林疗养区四座疗养院工程的设计。在这项工程的设计中，由于设计工程师对“民族形式”缺乏正确的理解，机械地模仿古代建筑形式，片面追求建筑物的“轮廓线”和表面装饰，而没有很好地贯彻实用、经济并在可能条件下适当讲求美观的方针，造成严重的铺张浪费。  （据新华社讯）
