Tsinghua University Rewards "Advanced Collectives"

    On March 13th, at the 11th Student Representative Assembly of Tsinghua University, Vice President Liu Xianzhou, on behalf of the University Affairs Committee, awarded the title of "Advanced Collective" to forty-one classes.

    "Advanced Collective" is currently the best working method and organizational form created by Tsinghua University students. Through the activity of striving to become an "Advanced Collective," the sense of collective honor and responsibility is strengthened, and each student is encouraged to cultivate themselves into a well-rounded new person. A year ago, the first "Advanced Collective" appeared in the school – Class 2, Grade 2 of the Surveying Specialization. Today, "Advanced Collectives" account for 24 percent of all classes in the school. Half of the ten classes in the Department of Architecture have become "Advanced Collectives." They have achieved significant results in implementing the "Three Goods" instructed by Chairman Mao. For example, in the fourth grade of the Thermal Power Equipment major, the class's overall average score in the final exam last semester was 4.69, with no failures, and ten students received a perfect score of five in every subject. Significant progress has been made in political thought, with Party and League members accounting for 91 percent of the class.

    After the school awarded the prizes, each "Advanced Collective" class held separate or joint celebrations, and their wall newspapers were filled with enthusiastic congratulatory letters from brother classes and teachers. Classes that did not receive the advanced title expressed their determination to learn from the "Advanced Collectives" and strive to make their own class an "Advanced Collective." (Li Zhiyuan)

    清华大学奖励“先进集体”
    三月十三日，在清华大学第十一届学生代表大会上，刘仙洲副校长代表校务委员会授予四十一个班级以“先进集体”的称号。
    “先进集体”是清华大学学生所创造的目前最好的工作方式和组织形式。通过争取成为“先进集体”的活动，加强集体的荣誉感和责任感，推动每个学生培养自己成为全面发展的新人。一年前，全校出现了第一个“先进集体”——测量专修科二年级二班。今天，“先进集体”已占全校班级的百分之二十四。建筑系十个班中，已有一半成为“先进集体”。他们在贯彻毛主席所指示的“三好”方面，取得了显著成绩。如热力发电设备专业四年级，上学期期终考试成绩全班总平均是四点六九，没有不及格的，有十个同学门门功课得五分。政治思想上进步很大，党团员已占全班同学百分之九十一。
    在学校发奖以后，各“先进集体”班级都分别或联合召开了庆祝会，它们的墙报上贴满了一封封从兄弟班级和老师那里送来的热情贺信。没有获得先进称号的班级，纷纷表示要努力向“先进集体”学习，争取自己的班也成为“先进集体”。  （黎诣远）
