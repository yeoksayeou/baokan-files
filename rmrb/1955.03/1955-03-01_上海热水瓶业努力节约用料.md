    Shanghai Thermos Industry Strives to Save Materials
    The five-pound metal-cased thermos bottles produced by the Shanghai thermos industry use imported tinplate as the raw material for their metal casings. Since the comprehensive launch of the movement to save raw materials, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Merchandise Company has conducted a detailed investigation into the tinplate consumption of five-pound thermos bottles. It was found that the methods used by various factories in the thermos bottle industry for the inner screw rings and blanking differed. The Continental Thermos Bottle Factory carefully planned and cut materials to save materials without damaging them, while some larger factories emphasized unnecessary formalities and adhered to past blanking conventions, resulting in a large waste of raw materials. To save raw materials and reduce the burden on consumers, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Merchandise Company, without affecting quality, organized three technical exchange meetings to introduce the blanking methods and experience of the Continental Thermos Bottle Factory to various factories. Starting in February, after modifications and additions to equipment, all factories in the thermos bottle industry uniformly implemented new blanking methods for five-pound thermos bottle metal casings. This will save the country 83,500 jin of tinplate raw materials annually. The raw materials saved can be used to make 83,500 five-pound metal-cased thermos bottles.

    上海热水瓶业努力节约用料
    上海市热水瓶业生产的五磅金属壳热水瓶，金属壳原料是进口马口铁。自全面开展节约原材料运动以来，中国百货公司上海采购供应站就对五磅热水瓶的马口铁用料作了详尽的调查，发现热水瓶业各厂对瓶壳里罗丝圈及落料方法各不相同，大陆热水瓶厂精打套裁，做到节约不伤料，而有些较大型厂，则讲究不必要的形式，墨守过去落料成规，大量浪费原材料。中国百货公司上海采购供应站在不影响品质原则下，为了节约原材料，减轻消费者的负担，曾经三次组织技术交流会，向各厂介绍了大陆热水瓶厂的落料方法和经验。二月份起，热水瓶业各厂经改装和添置设备后，统一实行新的五磅热水瓶金属壳落料方法，这样每年可为国家节约八万三千五百市斤马口铁原料，用这些节约下来的原料可作八万三千五百个五磅金属壳热水瓶。
