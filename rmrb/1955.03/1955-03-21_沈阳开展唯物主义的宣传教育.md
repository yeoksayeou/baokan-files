Shenyang Carries Out the Propaganda and Education of Materialism

The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch an education campaign on the dialectical materialism worldview among cadres with reading ability within the party and intellectuals outside the party throughout the city. The Municipal Committee plans to use spare time this month to systematically explain the main issues in the current ideological struggle to cadres and intellectuals inside and outside the party, combining the problems in Shenyang's actual work and the ideological conditions of cadres and intellectuals to explain the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism in simple terms. This kind of lecture will be held once or twice a month, and new content will be gradually added to make it a regular lecture series for publicizing materialism and the party's policies to cadres and intellectuals. At present, the Municipal Committee has organized and studied the topics for 123 lecturers in the city. On March 17, the Municipal Committee held a meeting of all lecturers, at which Wang Bojin, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, made a mobilization report. The meeting also held group discussions on the lecture and research work plan for the first half of the year.

    沈阳开展唯物主义的宣传教育
    中共沈阳市委会决定在全市党内有阅读能力的干部和党外知识分子中展开辩证唯物主义世界观的教育。市委计划在本月底利用业余时间有计划地向党内外干部和知识分子讲解当前思想斗争中的主要问题，结合沈阳市实际工作中的问题和干部、知识分子的思想状况，通俗地说明马克思列宁主义和辩证唯物主义的基本观点。这种讲演每月将进行一次到两次，并逐渐增加新内容，使之成为向干部和知识分子宣传唯物主义和党的政策的定期讲座。目前市委已将全市一百二十三名报告员进行了编组和研究了讲题。三月十七日市委召开了全体讲演人会议，由市委第二书记王伯瑾作了动员报告，会上还分组讨论了上半年的讲演和研究工作的计划。
