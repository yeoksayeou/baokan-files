    "Automatic Block Signals" on Railways
    Sun Jin
    The "automatic block signals" manufactured by the Shenyang Railway Signal Factory have been installed on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway between Zhangguizhuang East Station and Xinhe Station. This is a new achievement in the technological transformation of China's railways.
      A railway line is called a section, and each section has many stations. The small section between stations is called an interval. Under normal circumstances, only one train can run in each interval, and various systems are used to prevent trains running in the interval from colliding with trailing or oncoming trains, in order to ensure safety. The "electrical token" and "electrical tablet" system currently used on China's railways involves the stationmasters of both stations in each interval contacting each other in advance, and issuing a token or a copper tablet to the locomotive driver as proof of departure. With this system, only one train is allowed to run in each interval, and drivers cannot be notified to stop if there is a fault on the line in the middle of the interval.
      The "automatic block signal" is an electrical signal that automatically indicates the train's operation. It uses the train's short-circuiting of the track circuit to automatically control the signal lights and display colors. When installing "automatic block signals," each interval is further divided into several "block sections," and a signal machine capable of emitting green, yellow, and red lights is installed at the beginning of each block section. Any signal machine will show a green light when there are no trains in the two block sections in front of it, indicating that the train can proceed at the prescribed speed; when there is no train in the one block section in front of it, it will show a yellow light, indicating that the train should reduce its speed and proceed; as soon as the train enters the block section belonging to the green or yellow signal machine, the signal machine will immediately show a red light, reporting "There is a train in this block section, and other trains are not allowed to enter."
    After installing "automatic block signals," the various complicated manual procedures for controlling trains are eliminated, the safety of train operation is increased, and several trains can run simultaneously in each section according to the instructions of the signal machines, which can meet the requirements of busy transportation.

    铁路上的“自动闭塞信号”
    孙今
    沈阳铁路信号工厂制造的“自动闭塞信号”，已经在北京至山海关铁路上张贵庄东站至新河站间装设起来。这是我国铁路技术改造的一项新成就。
      一条铁路线被称为一个区段，每个区段上设了很多车站，站与站之间的小段被称为一个区间。在一般情况下，每一区间内只能行驶一趟列车，而且还要用种种制度，使区间内行驶的列车：不受尾随的和迎面开来的其他列车的冲突，以保证安全。现在我国铁路上采用的“电气路签”和“电气路牌”制，是由每一区间双方车站的站长事先取得联系，发一个签棒或一块铜牌，交给机车司机作为开车的凭证。采用这种制度，每个区间只准许一趟列车运行，中途线路发生故障时也不能通知司机停车。
      “自动闭塞信号”是一种自动指示列车运行的电气信号，它是利用列车短路轨道电路来自动控制信号灯，显示颜色的。装置“自动闭塞信号”时，把每一区间再划分成若干“闭塞分区”，在每一闭塞分区的始端装设一架能够放射绿、黄、红三种颜色灯光的信号机。任何一架信号机，当它前面的两个闭塞分区没有列车时，就显出绿色灯光，指示列车按规定速度开进去；当它前面的一个闭塞分区没有列车时，就显出黄色灯光，指示列车减低速度开进去，当列车一经开入绿色的或黄色的信号机所属闭塞分区时，信号机就马上显出红色灯光，报告“本闭塞分区内有车，其他列车不准再开进去”。
    装置“自动闭塞信号”后，免去了人力控制列车的各种繁杂的手续，增加了行车安全的保障，每个区段根据信号机的指示，可以有数趟列车同时进行，能够满足繁忙的运输要求。
