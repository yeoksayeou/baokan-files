Serves Them Right!
Jiang Yuanchun

The 19th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to be held on March 29th. This time, the United States has once again instructed the International Labor Office of the United Nations to submit a report slandering China for so-called "forced labor," preparing to discuss it at the Economic and Social Council. Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, in his letter to the United Nations Secretary-General on March 23rd, refuted this slander and pointed out that it was deliberate rumor-mongering and a malicious slander against the great Chinese people.

Slandering the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries for so-called "forced labor" in the United Nations has become a part of the United States' "Cold War." The purpose of the United States is to use this slander to create a so-called "moral" basis for its aggressive acts and war preparation policies. The United States also attempts to use this slander to cover up the forced labor in the United States under the constant threat of unemployment, thereby proving that the United States, controlled by American monopoly capital, is a so-called "free world."

It is no accident that the United States is now particularly focused on slandering China. On the eve of the Asian-African Conference, the United States is extremely afraid that its colonialism will be condemned at the Asian-African Conference. As Iraqi representative Gadly pointed out in the Third Committee of the United Nations in 1954, colonial exploitation itself is an example of forced labor. Therefore, the United States is trying to use the slander against China to show that it is not a colonialist, and at the same time to obstruct the efforts of Asian and African countries to oppose colonial enslavement and oppression.

The only basis the United States uses to slander China is the Chinese government's policy of reforming counter-revolutionaries and criminals through labor. The United States is making every effort to defame this humane policy, which is unanimously supported by the entire Chinese people, stemming from its considerations of aggression against China. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson stated on March 10th that he hoped that "forces of division, disappointment and unrest" in China would "brew to take action" and "cause" the "internal disintegration" of the Chinese People's regime. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, "always ready" with the support of the United States, could "take advantage" of this situation. Obviously, if counter-revolutionaries and criminals recognize their crimes in labor reform, repent and start anew, it would be extremely unfavorable to the United States' conspiracy to create "forces of division, disappointment and unrest" in China to subvert China.

But what can be done about it? In China, prisoners become healthy, happy, and actively productive people after labor reform. Some foreign friends who have visited Chinese prisons have also admitted that this is beneficial to the Chinese people. However, the American aggressor bloc always believes that what is beneficial to the Chinese people is detrimental to it, and it believes that it must turn China into a "free world" like the United States, where the Ku Klux Klan is free to slaughter blacks and the Un-American Activities Committee is free to persecute scientists, teachers, actors, and all kinds of people. The American masters have never been willing to look at their own ugly faces in the demon-revealing mirror, and they are always wishfully trying to create the world according to their ugly faces. In reality, they are always creating their own disappointments. This is well-deserved!

    活该！

    联合国经济及社会理事会第十九届会议定于三月二十九日举行。这一次，美国又指使联合国国际劳工局提出了一个诬蔑中国有所谓“强迫劳动”的报告，准备在经济及社会理事会上讨论。苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫在三月二十三日就这个报告给联合国秘书长的信中已经驳斥了这种诬蔑，并且指出这是有意造谣和对伟大的中国人民的恶毒诽谤。
    在联合国中诬蔑苏联、中国和各人民民主国家有所谓“强迫劳动”，已经成为美国的“冷战”的一部分。美国的目的是要用这种诬蔑来给自己的侵略行为和备战政策制造所谓“道义上”的根据。美国也企图用这种诬蔑来掩盖美国国内在失业的经常威胁下的强迫劳动，从而证明美国垄断资本控制下的美国是一个所谓“自由世界”。
    美国在现在来特别着重地诬蔑中国，并不是偶然的。在亚非会议前夕，美国极其害怕它的殖民主义在亚非会议上受到谴责。正如伊拉克代表加德利一九五四年在联合国第三委员会中所指出的，殖民剥削本身就是强迫劳动的例子。因此，美国企图用对中国的诬蔑来表明自己不是殖民主义者，同时借以阻挠亚非各国反对殖民奴役和压迫的努力。
    美国用来诬蔑中国的唯一根据，就是中国政府对反革命分子和刑事罪犯实行劳动改造的政策。美国竭力诽谤这个得到全中国人民一致拥护的合乎人道的政策，是从它侵略中国的考虑出发的。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊三月十日表示，他希望“分裂、失望和不安的势力”在中国“酝酿采取行动”，“引起”中国人民政权“内部的瓦解”，到那时候，在美国支持下“随时保持准备状态”的蒋介石卖国集团就可以“利用”这种局面了。显然，如果反革命分子和刑事罪犯在劳动改造中认识了自己的罪恶，悔过自新，重新做人，这对于美国在中国制造“分裂、失望和不安的势力”企图颠覆中国的阴谋，当然是极其不利的。
    但这又有什么办法呢？在中国，犯人们经过劳动改造变成健康愉快、积极生产的人。参观过中国监狱的一些外国朋友们也承认过，这对中国人民是有利的事。可是，对中国人民有利的事情美国侵略集团总认为是对它不利的，它就认为非把中国变成像美国那样有三K党自由屠杀黑人、有非美活动委员会自由迫害科学家、教师、演员以及各种人民的“自由世界”不可。美国老爷们向来不肯从照妖镜里看看他们自己的尊容，老是痴心妄想照他们的丑脸来制造世界。实际上，他们却老是在制造他们自己的失望。这是活该！
