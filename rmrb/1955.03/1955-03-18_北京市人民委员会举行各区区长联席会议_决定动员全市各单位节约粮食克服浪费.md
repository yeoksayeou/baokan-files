Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The Beijing Municipal People's Committee held a joint meeting of district heads on the 17th to discuss the issue of conserving grain.

Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain in Beijing, grain prices have been stable, supply has been normal, and people from all walks of life have been satisfied with the state's policy. However, due to some shortcomings in the management of the grain departments, and also because many cadres and the masses have an insufficient understanding of the significance of saving grain, the phenomenon of wasting grain is quite serious. The meeting believes that it is necessary to criticize the idea of wasting grain and establish a habit of saving grain among cadres and the masses.

Based on the spirit of "guaranteeing supply and preventing waste," the meeting decided to start immediately mobilizing all units in the city, including government agencies, organizations, factories, enterprises, schools, and hospitals, to conserve grain, overcome waste, pay attention to educating mess hall managers and cooks to cherish grain, study various methods of saving grain, improve mess hall management, and formulate plans for saving grain. If the number of employees eating in mess halls citywide is calculated at 800,000, saving just four to eight ounces of grain per person per month would save at least 2.4 million to 4.8 million catties of grain per year. The meeting believes that in order to save grain in all aspects, grain departments should effectively improve the management of grain operations, strengthen the storage and transportation of grain, and supervise and inspect public and private grain processing and consignment sales outlets.

    北京市人民委员会举行各区区长联席会议
    决定动员全市各单位节约粮食克服浪费
    据新华社十七日讯：北京市人民委员会在十七日举行了各区区长联席会议，讨论节约粮食问题。
    北京市自粮食统购统销以来，粮价稳定，供应正常，各阶层人民都对国家的政策感到满意。但是由于粮食部门在管理工作上还有一些缺点，同时有许多干部和群众在思想上对节约粮食的意义认识不足，因而浪费粮食的现象相当严重。会议认为，必须批判浪费粮食的思想，在干部和群众中树立节约粮食的风气。
    会议根据“既能保证供应，又能防止浪费”的精神，决定自即日起首先在全市机关、团体、工厂、企业、学校、医院等单位中动员节约粮食，克服浪费，并注意教育伙食管理员、炊事员爱惜粮食，研究节约粮食的各种办法，改进食堂的管理工作，订出节约粮食的计划。全市职工入伙人数按八十万计算，如果每人每月节约四两到八两粮食，一年就至少可节约粮食二百四十万斤到四百八十万斤。会议认为，为了从各方面来节约粮食，粮食部门应该切实改善粮食的经营管理，加强粮食保管储运和对公、私营粮食加工、代销户的督促检查。
