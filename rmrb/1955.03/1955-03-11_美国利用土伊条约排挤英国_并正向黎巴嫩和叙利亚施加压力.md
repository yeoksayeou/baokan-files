Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: American newspapers admit that the United States is attempting to use the recently signed Turkish-Iraqi pact to squeeze out British influence in the Middle East.

According to TASS reports, the "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, Schmidt, commenting on the Middle East situation after the signing of the Turkish-Iraqi pact, pointed out with satisfaction: "The United States is gradually replacing Britain as the most powerful Western country in a region that has been held by Britain since World War I."

"Chicago Sun-Times" correspondent in Washington, Frederick Kuh, reported that American power is pushing out British power in the Middle East. The reporter said that if the Turkish-Iraqi treaty is viewed from this angle, the intention of signing this treaty becomes very clear. He wrote: "The United States helped form this alliance... American military assistance is the bait used to lure the current and future members of the new alliance. American weapons are constantly being shipped to Turkey and Pakistan. Iraq will also soon receive weapons."

The reporter continued that although Britain outwardly welcomes the increasing American interest in Middle East "defense," "in reality, these events cause anxiety among many Britons. British power in Asia has declined. Its power in Africa is constantly weakening. The British are no longer an important factor in the Pacific... The United States is constantly entering places where it is pushing out Britain."

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 7th: TASS Beirut, March 6th: According to newspaper reports, the United States is putting pressure on Lebanon to force it to join the Turkish-Iraqi military alliance. Beirut's widely circulated "Al-Chark" newspaper, commenting on Lebanese Ambassador to the United States Charles Malik's trip to Beirut, said that the US government "expressed its willingness" to offer Lebanon "generous proposals"; it demanded that the latter join the Turkish-Iraqi military alliance in exchange. The newspaper pointed out that the United States expressed its willingness to provide Lebanon with weapons and more economic "aid."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 10th: TASS Cairo, March 9th: Egypt's "Al-Gomhuria" said that Western countries are exerting particularly strong pressure on Syria to force it to abandon its policy of not participating in the military alliances planned by Western countries, and to prevent it from signing a new collective security pact for Arab countries without Iraq's participation.

The newspaper said that two weeks ago, on the day that Egyptian Minister of National Guidance Salah Salem arrived in Damascus to consult with the Syrian government on strengthening Arab cooperation and rejecting the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, the US government sent a note to the Syrian government insisting that Arab countries participate in an alliance with Western countries. The note expressed dissatisfaction with the policies of the Syrian government.

    美国利用土伊条约排挤英国
    并正向黎巴嫩和叙利亚施加压力
    【新华社四日讯】美国报纸承认，美国企图利用最近签订的土耳其—伊拉克条约来排挤英国在中东的势力。
    据塔斯社报道：“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者施密特在评论土耳其—伊拉克条约签订后的中东局势时，满意地指出：“美国在一个自从第一次世界大战以来就一直是英国所把持的地区内，正在逐渐地代替英国成为最有势力的西方国家。”
    “芝加哥太阳时报”驻华盛顿记者弗雷德里克·库报道，美国势力正在排挤英国在中东的势力。这位记者说，如果从这个角度来看土耳其—伊拉克条约，那么签订这一条约的用意就显得很明白了。他写道：“美国帮助组成了这一联盟。……美国军事援助是用来引诱新联盟的现在和将来的成员国的诱饵。美国武器正源源不断地运往土耳其和巴基斯坦。伊拉克不久也将得到武器。”
    这位记者继续写道，虽然英国表面上欢迎美国对中东“防务”越来越感兴趣，但是，“实际上，这些事件引起许多英国人的忧虑。英国在亚洲的势力下降了。它在非洲的势力不断削弱着。英国人在太平洋也不再是重要因素了。……美国不断进入那些它正在排挤英国的地方。”
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特六日讯：据报纸消息说，美国正在对黎巴嫩施加压力以迫使它加入土耳其—伊拉克军事联盟。贝鲁特销路很广的“查里达报”就黎巴嫩驻美国大使查尔斯·马利克的贝鲁特之行发表评论说，美国政府“表示愿意”向黎巴嫩提出“慷慨的建议”；它要求后者加入土耳其—伊拉克军事联盟作为交换条件。这家报纸指出，美国表示愿意给予黎巴嫩武器和更多的经济“援助”。
   【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社开罗九日讯：埃及
  “共和国报”说，西方国家正对叙利亚施加特别强大的压力，来迫使它放弃不参加西方国家策划的军事联盟的政策，并且要它不签订没有伊拉克参加的新的阿拉伯国家集体安全公约。
    这家报纸说，两个星期前，在埃及国家指导部长赛拉·萨勒姆到达大马士革就加强阿拉伯的合作和拒绝参加土耳其—伊拉克条约的问题同叙利亚政府进行磋商那一天，美国政府以照会一件送交叙利亚政府，坚持要阿拉伯国家参加和西方国家的联盟。照会对叙利亚政府的政策表示不满。
