    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has issued a decision on "March 8" International Women's Day, excerpts of which are as follows:
    The working people of our country are commemorating this year's "March 8" International Women's Day while making every effort to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy as soon as possible, steadily developing heavy industry—the strong foundation of the entire Soviet economy—further strengthening the socialist countries, and promoting the welfare of the Soviet people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet working people, in friendly cooperation with the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp, have consistently safeguarded the cause of peace, and have always striven to ease international tensions and for collective security among nations. When implementing the great communist construction plan, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are full of confidence in their strength, in the indestructible power of our great motherland and the entire peaceful, democratic, socialist camp.
    The decision emphasizes that Soviet women are engaged in selfless labor in all aspects of economic, administrative, cultural, public and political life. They increase the wealth of the country and make important contributions to the completion of the construction of socialist society and the gradual transition to communism.
    The decision points out that Soviet women actively participate in the work of every link of the state machinery. Three hundred and forty-eight women are deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, more than two thousand women are deputies to the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, and more than five hundred thousand women are deputies to local Soviets. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-five women have been elected as people's judges, and two hundred and thirty-four thousand women have been elected as people's assessors.
    More than one million Soviet women contribute their energy and talent to the noble cause of educating the next generation and nurturing Soviet children. More than two million women work in various public health and sports institutions, taking care of the health of the Soviet people with enthusiasm. Nearly three million women work in scientific, educational, and cultural institutions. More than one million four hundred thousand women are studying in universities and secondary specialized schools. Soviet women enrich the achievements of science and engineering with new discoveries and inventions, and also make significant contributions to literature and art.
    Two thousand three hundred and seventy-three women have been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Socialist Labor for their contributions to the country. More than one million women have been awarded medals and orders, and seven hundred and forty-six women have been awarded Stalin Prizes for their outstanding achievements in science and engineering, literature and art, and for major improvements in inventions and production methods.
    The Soviet state constantly cares for and is concerned about women. It protects women's labor and the welfare of mothers and children. Women are guaranteed the same rights as men to work, rest, and receive education. They are treated with equal pay for equal work and enjoy the same social insurance benefits.
    In the Soviet Union, mothers receive great care. Pregnant women are granted paid leave by the state. Material assistance is given to mothers with many children and single mothers.
    In 1954 alone, more than 7 billion rubles were given in allowances to mothers with many children, single mothers, and those caring for infants. Mothers with many children are respected throughout the country. More than 44,000 women have received the title of Heroine Mother, and more than 4.5 million women have been awarded the Order of Maternal Glory and the Medal of Motherhood. Obstetric hospitals, women and child clinics, nurseries, and kindergartens have been widely established in our country.
    The decision continues, saying that the lives of Soviet women and their heroic labor for the prosperity of our country are an inspiring example to women in all countries, and powerfully prove that only socialism guarantees the complete liberation of women and creates the conditions for their abilities and wisdom to develop.
    In the various people's democracies, women are commemorating "March 8" with new achievements in democratic and socialist construction, in improving people's welfare, and in developing science and culture.
    The working women of capitalist countries are commemorating "March 8" International Women's Day under conditions of further intensification of exploitation, a growing number of unemployed, and a declining standard of living.
    The fate of women in the capitalist world is made more difficult by the limitations placed on their rights in all aspects of social life. In many capitalist countries, women do not have the right to elect or be elected to state power organs. They do the same work as men but receive less pay. Opportunities for education and obtaining employment are even more difficult for women than for men. The fate of women in colonies and dependent countries is particularly tragic and distressing.
    The anger and protest of women in capitalist countries against economic and political oppression is increasing year by year. More and more women are joining the ranks of active fighters against all forms of social and national oppression, and for human freedom and happiness.
    Women are actively coming out to defend peace, against the arms race launched by the imperialists and the preparations for another world war. The struggle of women for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, for easing international tensions and for maintaining world peace is expanding on an increasing scale. The International Democratic Women's Federation, uniting 140 million women in 66 countries, plays an important role in this struggle.
    Soviet women stand at the forefront of the international democratic women's movement. They stand at the forefront of the fighters for peace, against the atomic war that the imperialists are preparing, and for the peaceful settlement of all outstanding international issues. Soviet women are strengthening their friendship with women of all countries, with all those who cherish the interests of peace, democratic rights, and the welfare of children. All progressive women in the world consider Soviet women to be their loyal allies and friends in the active struggle for peace, democracy, and progress.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union wholeheartedly congratulates Soviet women on "March 8" International Women's Day and asks them to strive to further strengthen the power of the Soviet state and its indestructible foundation—the alliance of the working class and the collective farmers—and to further consolidate the fraternal friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.
    The decision requires Soviet women to work tirelessly for the further development of industry, especially heavy industry, for the further upsurge of socialist agriculture, and for the development of advanced Soviet science, culture, literature and art, public education, and public health.
    The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union states that Soviet women will, as in the past, uphold the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union, will be at the forefront of the struggle of women of all countries for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, for the prevention of a new world war, and will strengthen the international ties of working women in this struggle.
    The decision concludes: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on all Soviet women to participate more actively in communist construction and in the struggle for international security.

    苏联共产党中央委员会
    颁布关于“三八”国际妇女节的决定
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：苏联共产党中央委员会颁布了关于“三八”国际妇女节的决定，摘要如下：
    我国劳动人民是在全力争取早日完成第五个发展苏联国民经济五年计划、稳步发展重工业——苏联整个经济的强大基础、进一步加强社会主义国家和促进苏联人民的福利的情况下纪念今年的“三八”国际妇女节的。在共产党的领导下，苏联劳动人民同整个社会主义阵营的各国人民友好合作，一贯维护和平事业，始终为缓和国际紧张局势、为各国间的集体安全而努力。苏联各族人民在执行伟大的共产主义建设计划时，对于他们的力量，对于我们伟大的祖国和整个和平民主社会主义阵营的不可摧毁的威力充满信心。
    决定强调说，苏联妇女在经济、行政、文化、公共和政治生活的各方面进行忘我的劳动，她们增加国家的财富，对完成社会主义社会的建设和向共产主义的逐步过渡作出了重要的贡献。
    决定指出，苏联妇女积极参加国家机器的每一个环节的工作。三百四十八名妇女是苏联最高苏维埃代表，二千名以上妇女是各加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃代表，五十万以上妇女是地方苏维埃代表。二千三百三十五名妇女被选为人民法官，二十三万四千名妇女被选为人民陪审员。
    一百多万苏联妇女为教育下一代的崇高事业，培育苏联儿童贡献她们的精力和才能。二百多万妇女在各种公共卫生和体育机构工作，热心地照顾着苏联人民的健康。近三百万妇女在科学、教育、和文化机关中工作。一百四十多万妇女在高等学校和中等专科学校学习。苏联妇女以新的发现和发明丰富科学和工程的成就，对文学和艺术的贡献也不小。
    二千三百七十三名妇女由于对国家的贡献而获得了苏联英雄和社会主义劳动英雄的称号。一百多万妇女获得了勋章和奖章，七百四十六名妇女由于在科学和工程、文学和艺术方面的突出的成绩，由于发明和生产方法的重大改进而获得了斯大林奖金。
    苏维埃国家经常关怀和关心妇女。它保护妇女的劳动和母亲和儿童的福利。妇女得到保证有同男子一样的工作、休息和受教育的权利。她们得到同工同酬的待遇，享受同样的社会保险利益。
    在苏联，母亲获得很大的照顾。孕妇由国家给予工资照付的休假。对子女众多的母亲和单身母亲给予物质帮助。
    在一九五四年一年中，给予子女众多的母亲、单身母亲和照顾婴儿的津贴共计七十亿卢布以上。儿女众多的母亲受到全国的尊敬。有四万四千多名妇女得到母亲英雄的称号，有四百五十多万名妇女获得“母亲之光”勋章和“母德奖章”的荣誉。在我国已经普遍设立了产科医院、妇婴诊疗所、托儿所和幼儿园。
    决定继续说，苏联妇女的生活和她们为了我国富足而进行的英雄劳动，是一切国家妇女的令人鼓舞的榜样，而且有力地证明了，只有社会主义才保证妇女的彻底解放，创造使她们的能力和智慧能够发展的条件。
    在各人民民主国家中，妇女以在民主和社会主义建设方面，在提高人民福利和发展科学和文化方面的新成就来纪念“三八”节。
    资本主义国家的劳动妇女在剥削进一步加紧、失业人数日益增多、生活水准日益降低的情况下纪念“三八”国际妇女节。
    资本主义世界妇女的命运由于她们在社会生活各方面的权利受到限制而更加艰苦。在许多资本主义国家中，妇女没有权利选举或被选入国家权力机构中。她们同男子们做同样的工作而所得的报酬却较少。受教育和获得职业的机会对妇女说来甚至比男子们更为困难。殖民地和附属国的妇女的命运特别悲惨和困苦。
    资本主义国家妇女对于经济和政治压迫的愤怒和抗议，一年比一年增加。愈来愈多的妇女参加了反对各种方式的社会和民族压迫、争取人类自由和幸福的积极战士的队伍。
    妇女们积极地出来保卫和平、反对帝国主义者发动的军备运动和另一次世界战争的准备工作。妇女们为了禁止原子武器和氢武器、缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平而进行的斗争，规模日益扩大。团结着六十六个国家的一亿四千万妇女的国际民主妇女联合会在这一斗争中起着重要作用。
    苏联妇女站在国际民主妇女运动的前列。她们站在争取和平、反对帝国主义者正在准备的原子战争，争取以和平方法解决一切悬而未决的国际问题的战士的前列。苏联妇女正在加强同所有国家的妇女，同一切珍爱和平利益、民主权利和儿童福利的人们的友谊。世界全体进步妇女认为苏联妇女是她们在争取和平、民主和进步的积极斗争中的忠实盟友和朋友。
    苏联共产党中央委员会衷心向苏联妇女祝贺“三八”国际妇女节，并要求她们为进一步加强苏维埃国家的威力和它的不可摧毁的基础——工人阶级和集体农民的联盟而努力，为进一步巩固苏联各族人民的兄弟友谊而努力。
    决定要求苏联妇女为工业，首先是重工业的进一步发展，为社会主义农业的进一步高涨，为先进的苏联科学、文化、文学和艺术、公共教育和公共卫生事业的发展而不倦地努力。
    苏联共产党中央委员会的决定说，苏联妇女将和过去一样维护苏联的和平外交政策，将走在世界各国妇女进行的争取禁止原子武器和氢武器、防止新的世界战争的斗争的最前列，并且将在这个斗争中加强各国劳动妇女的国际联系。
    决定最后说：苏联共产党中央委员会号召苏联全体妇女更加积极地参加共产主义建设，参加争取国际安全的斗争。
