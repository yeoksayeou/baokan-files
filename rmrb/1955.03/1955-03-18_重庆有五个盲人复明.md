    Chongqing Municipal Second People's Hospital's Department of Otolaryngology diligently studied the Soviet "corneal transplantation method" and successfully treated five totally and partially blind individuals. During the study period, doctors in the hospital's Department of Otolaryngology conducted trial corneal transplant surgeries on rabbits. In January of this year, they examined the experimental results and confirmed that the rabbits' eyes had good vision. As a result, they formally performed "corneal transplantation" surgery on Wang Tiangui (female), a geological worker who had lost sight in her right eye twenty-one years ago and relied entirely on her left eye for vision. Wang Tiangui's right eye has now regained sight. Of the five totally and partially blind individuals treated by the hospital, except for one who is still receiving treatment, the other four have been discharged from the hospital and have returned to work.

    重庆有五个盲人复明
    重庆市立第二人民医院五官科认真学习苏联
  “角膜移植法”，医治好五个全盲和半盲人。该院五官科医生在学习时期，试行家兔角膜移植手术，到今年一月，检验实验效果，证明兔子眼珠视物良好。于是他们正式给早在二十一年前右眼失明，全凭左眼视物的地质工作者王天贵（女）施行“角膜移植”手术。现在王天贵的右眼已经复明。经过该院先后医治的五个全盲和半盲人，除一人正在医治外，其他四人都已出院工作。（本报驻重庆记者）
