    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Hunan, Shandong, and Other Provinces
    Transfer Spring Ploughing Production Materials to Supply Rural Areas
    [By this newspaper] Supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces are actively transferring large quantities of means of production to supply farmers for spring ploughing. By the end of February, the preparatory committee of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives had transported more than 25,000 tons of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer to rural areas to supply spring ploughing. Various kinds of miscellaneous fertilizers prepared by local supply and marketing cooperatives from local materials before spring ploughing also amounted to more than 40,000 tons. The early rice seeds needed in the Dongting Lake area have been adequately prepared. More than 5,600 head of draught cattle purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives in Shaoyang, Hengyang, Chenxian and other special districts are being transported to the counties around the lake. In the first quarter, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative prepared to supply the four main cotton-producing areas of Huimin, Dezhou, Liaocheng and Heze with more oil cake, chemical fertilizer, small farm tools, pesticides, agricultural machinery and draught animals than the supply volume in the same period last year. According to incomplete statistics, 30 million catties of various cake fertilizers and chemical fertilizers have already been supplied to farmers, and the total value of small farm tools supplied has reached more than 110,000 yuan. The 30.13 million catties of high-quality cotton seeds stored by the supply and marketing cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas are also being supplied to cotton farmers who lack seeds. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the Liaocheng Special District and local agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have signed more than 6,670 pre-sale contracts, pre-selling 8.94 million catties of soybean cake, cottonseed cake and chemical fertilizer, and 64 double-wheel double-shared plows. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the Weinan Special District of Shaanxi Province have stored and transferred more than 7 million catties of chemical fertilizer and oil cake, more than 4,000 double-wheel double-shared plows, double-wheel single-shared plows and various new-style walking plows, and more than 1.1 million catties of various pesticides and other means of production to supply farmers. More than 90% of the more than 1,000 double-wheel double-shared plows transferred by the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative to various places last winter were supplied to agricultural production cooperatives. The Southeast Jia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yu County recently purchased nine double-wheel double-shared plows and thirty-six livestock in succession. In addition, 163 water pumps manufactured by factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Changsha, Nanjing, Wuxi and other places have been successively shipped from the factory to 14 new and expanded state-owned water pumping stations in Changshu, Wujin, Kunshan, Huaiyin, Songjiang and other places in Jiangsu Province.
    In addition, local state-owned machinery and farm implement factories in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and the Rehe Iron Industry Production Cooperative are rushing to manufacture large quantities of farm implements to supply farmers. The Xuzhou Iron Factory in Jiangsu Province manufactures 1,000 double-wheel double-shared plows and 200 paddy field plows, the Jiangsu Machine Factory manufactures 66 double-cylinder diesel engines for water drawing, the Yangzhou Iron Factory manufactures 1,580 three-toothed weeding hoes, and other factories manufacture miscellaneous grain drills, nail-toothed harrows, and cotton seeders, etc. Local state-owned machinery and farm implement factories in Anhui Province are manufacturing a large number of double-wheel double-shared plows, double-wheel single-shared plows, disc harrows, sweet potato slicers, waterwheels, weeding machines, etc., totaling more than 36,000 pieces. Forty-two iron industry production cooperatives and twenty-one iron industry production groups in Rehe Province are manufacturing production tools needed by farmers for spring ploughing and summer hoeing. Forty percent of the more than 280,000 pieces of production tools ordered in the contracts they signed with the supply and marketing cooperatives have been delivered.
