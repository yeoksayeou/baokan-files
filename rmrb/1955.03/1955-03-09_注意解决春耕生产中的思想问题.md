    Pay Attention to Solving Ideological Problems in Spring Plowing Production
    Zhang Qian
    As the spring plowing season approaches, many newspapers have placed the promotion of spring plowing production in an important position. Among these, some newspapers have paid attention to raising and solving some common ideological problems, thus promoting the development of work.
    The Zhejiang Daily is an example. It criticized the single-handed work style of cadres and the idea of neglecting the leadership of spring plowing production through the case of more than ten members of the Jiaxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party engaging in grain work and the lack of leadership in production. The criticism also pointed out that under the influence of the county party committee, district and township cadres also had the wrong idea that "grain is a hard task and production is a soft task," which caused the county's spring plowing preparation work to be in a state of self-flow for a long time. However, when the spring plowing preparation work made some progress, cadres developed a paralyzing complacency, which became an obstacle to the development of spring plowing production. At this time, the newspaper published an article entitled "Is there really no problem?" reporting on the cadres of Jinhe Township, Xindeng County, criticizing the complacency of "taking a break". These reports by the newspaper played a certain role in promoting the spring plowing production movement. The Guangxi Daily also paid attention to criticizing the blindly optimistic and waiting thoughts of the masses, such as "there is a leap March this year, so there is no need to be busy yet" and "take it slowly," and paid attention to eliminating the masses' concerns about unified purchase and sale, in order to improve the masses' production enthusiasm and mobilize them to quickly carry out spring plowing preparation work.
    It can be seen from the reports of these two newspapers that in the spring plowing production movement, whether cadres or the masses, there are some ideological problems. Newspapers have the responsibility to undertake the task of ideological guidance, raise and solve these problems. Only in this way can the newspaper play its role of propaganda organization in the spring plowing production movement.
    However, the spring plowing production propaganda of some newspapers focuses on dynamic reports, such as only being enthusiastic about reflecting the warm atmosphere in production activities. Some newspapers only focus on reporting specific work arrangements and methods. Of course, it is also necessary to reflect the enthusiastic production activities of the peasant masses, as well as the leadership's measures and working methods. But if the newspaper only pays attention to reporting these, and does not report and solve ideological problems, this is not only relaxing its responsibility as an ideological weapon, but also giving people the illusion that this year's spring plowing production is smooth sailing. In order to more powerfully promote the spring plowing production work, our newspapers cannot be satisfied with reporting dynamics and work measures and methods, etc., but should use articles, news, and introductions to typical examples to deeply expose and solve the ideological problems in spring plowing production.

    注意解决春耕生产中的思想问题
    张浅
    随着春耕季节的到来，不少报纸已经把春耕生产的宣传，放到了重要的地位。在这当中，有的报纸注意提出和解决了一些带有普遍性的思想问题，因而推动了工作的开展。
    浙江日报就是一个例子。它通过中共嘉兴县委会十多个委员搞粮食工作，生产无人领导的事例，批评了干部当中的单打一的作风和忽视对春耕生产的领导的思想。批评中还指出，在县委的这种影响下，区乡干部也产生了“粮食是硬任务、生产是软任务”的错误想法，致使这个县的春耕准备工作长期处于自流状态。但是，在春耕准备工作稍有进展时，干部中又产生了一种麻痹自满情绪，这又成为春耕生产工作发展中的一种阻力。报纸这时就以“真的没有问题了吗？”为题发表文章，报道了新登县金河乡的干部批判“休息一下”等等自满思想的事例。报纸的这些报道，对于推动春耕生产运动，起了一定的作用。广西日报也注意批判了广大群众中的“今年有闰三月、还不用忙”、“慢慢来”等盲目乐观和等待思想，并注意消除群众对统购统销的顾虑，以提高群众的生产情绪，动员他们迅速进行春耕准备工作。
    从这两个报纸的报道中可以看出，在春耕生产运动中，无论是干部或群众，都存在着一些思想问题。报纸有责任把思想指导的任务担当起来，提出和解决这些问题。也只有这样，报纸才能在春耕生产运动中发挥它的宣传组织的作用。
    但是，有的报纸的春耕生产宣传，偏重于动态的报道，如只热心于反映生产活动中的热烈气氛。有的报纸只着重报道了具体的工作布置和作法。当然，反映农民群众热烈的生产活动，以及领导上的措施和工作方法，也是需要的。但如果报纸只注意报道这些，而不去报道和解决思想问题，这就不仅是放松了自己作为思想武器的责任，而且会给人一种错觉，以为今年的春耕生产是一帆风顺的。为了更有力地推动春耕生产工作，我们的报纸就不能满足于报道动态和工作措施方法等等，而应该通过文章、消息和对典型事例的介绍，来深入揭发和解决春耕生产中的思想问题。
