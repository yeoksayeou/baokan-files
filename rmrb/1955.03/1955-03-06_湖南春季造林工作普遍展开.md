Hunan Spring Afforestation Work Universally Unfolds
    Hunan Province's farmers are vigorously launching spring afforestation work. As of mid-February, according to statistics from eighty-one counties across the province, over 1.1 million mu of timber forests such as pine and fir have been planted. Farmers in Xiangxiang, Leiyang and other seven counties who have overfulfilled their tasks have now moved on to tending and protecting young trees.
    In the afforestation work, mutual aid and cooperation organizations have played a significant role. Although the Wusi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuelai Township, Yongxing County, did not have seedlings for afforestation, they still managed to plant more than 17,000 wild tree seedlings. In Gucheng Township, Linwu County, to complete the afforestation task, more than 150 farm households organized afforestation mutual aid teams and planted more than 360 mu in just a few days.
    Hunan Province plans to afforest over 2 million mu this year. To successfully complete this task, eighty-six state-owned and private nurseries throughout the province have cultivated more than 600 million seedlings, mainly pine and fir, and are currently starting to lift the seedlings and supply them to farmers as needed.

    湖南春季造林工作普遍展开
    湖南省农民大力开展春季造林工作，截至二月中旬止，据全省八十一个县的统计，已造植松、杉等用材林一百一十多万亩。超额完成任务的湘乡、耒阳等七县农民，现已转入抚育和保护幼林工作。
    在造林工作中，各地互助合作组织发挥了很大作用。永兴县悦来乡五四农业生产合作社虽没有苗木造林，但他们还是想办法种植了一万七千多株野生树苗。临武县古城乡农民为了完成造林任务，有一百五十多户农民组织了造林互助组，在几天之内即造植了三百六十多亩。
    湖南省计划今年造林二百多万亩，为了胜利完成这个任务，全省八十六个国营和私营苗圃，培育了以松、杉为主的苗木六亿多万株，目前已陆续起苗供应农民需要。
