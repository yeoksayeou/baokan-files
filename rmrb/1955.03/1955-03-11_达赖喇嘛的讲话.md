The Dalai Lama's Speech

Premier, esteemed leaders, comrades:

We arrived in the capital of our great motherland, Beijing, last September. In the more than six months since, we have successively met our beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and other leaders, successfully completed the glorious task of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, visited major cities of the motherland, smoothly resolved various major issues related to Tibetan work, and received assistance from all sides. In this short period, we have victoriously completed many tasks. In particular, for myself, through all these facts, I have not only realized that the motherland under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is prosperous, strong, peace-loving, and unafraid of any aggression; but also experienced the importance of unity among all ethnic groups in the motherland, especially between the Han and Tibetan peoples, and within Tibet itself, and the need to love the motherland even more. During this stay in Beijing, myself, all the monastic and secular officials, and accompanying personnel have received the utmost care and concern, sincere guidance, and strong assistance from our great leader Chairman Mao and other leaders. Today, the Premier is holding a grand banquet to see us off, and I and all the monastic and secular personnel feel extremely happy and excited from the bottom of our hearts, and express our heartfelt gratitude.

We will leave Beijing the day after tomorrow to visit the Northwest and Southwest, and then return to Tibet. After we arrive in Tibet, we will convey the above situation to the Tibetan people in detail, further strengthen the unity among all ethnic groups, especially between the Han and Tibetan peoples and within the Tibetan nationality, and thoroughly implement the various decisions passed by the State Council's plenary meeting. At the same time, since Tibet is located on the border of the motherland, it is even more important to consolidate national defense, constantly and tirelessly be vigilant and prevent all the deceptive and divisive conspiracies of imperialism, and strive to enhance the patriotic ideology of the Tibetan people.

As we are about to leave, I have an important request. During our stay in Beijing, we have received care, help, and guidance from all the leaders, and I have also honestly and frankly reported any opinions I have. In this way, we have practically established a close, brotherly, and sincere friendship between us. In the future, we will never be affected by the distance of our residences. Just as when I was staying here, if there are any tasks that cannot be completed or difficulties in my work, I will definitely report to the leaders without concealment and ask for instructions. I hope that the leaders will give direct instructions on any shortcomings and mistakes in our work, and teach and help me as in the past.

Finally, let us:

Drink a toast to the further consolidation and strengthening of the great unity of all ethnic groups, to the ever-increasing material and cultural life of all the people of the country, to the vigorous development of the motherland's socialist construction, and to our greater achievements in the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world!

Drink a toast to the good health of our great leader Chairman Mao of all ethnic groups!

Drink a toast to the good health of the Premier and all the leaders!

专栏：

    达赖喇嘛的讲话总理，各位首长，全体同志们：
    我们从去年九月来到伟大祖国的首都北京，到现在半年多的时间中，先后拜见了我国各族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和各位首长，圆满地完成了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的光荣任务，参观了祖国各大城市，顺利地解决了有关西藏工作的各项重大问题，并得到各方面的帮助。就在这很短的时间内，我们胜利地完成了上述许多工作。特别是拿我自己来说，通过这一切事实，不仅使我认识到在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的祖国，是富强有力，热爱和平，不怕任何侵略的；同时体验到祖国各兄弟民族间，特别是汉藏民族间，和西藏内部的团结的重要性，和更要热爱祖国。这次在京期间，我本人和全体僧俗官员以及随员等都受到伟大领袖毛主席和各位首长的无比爱护和关怀，真诚指教和大力帮助。今天在这里又蒙总理举行盛大宴会为我们送行，我和全体僧俗人员从内心感到无比的愉快和兴奋，特致以衷心的感谢。
    我们后天将离开北京到西北、西南参观，然后返回西藏。我们到西藏以后，要将上述情况向西藏人民详细传达，进一步加强各兄弟民族间，特别是汉藏民族和西藏民族内部的团结，彻底实现这次国务院全体会议通过的各项决定。同时，由于西藏地处祖国边疆，更重要的是，巩固祖国国防，经常不懈地警惕和防止帝国主义的一切欺骗、挑拨等破坏阴谋，为提高西藏人民的爱国主义思想而努力。
    在我们将要离开之际，我有一个重要的要求。这次我们留住北京期间，受到各位首长的关怀、帮助和教导，我自己有什么意见，也都老实坦白地报告了，这样就在我们互相之间，实际地建立了亲密无间的兄弟般的真诚友谊，今后我们决不因为住地的远近而有所影响，仍然像我住在这里一样，在自己的工作中如有完不成任务或困难的地方，一定毫无隐讳地向各位首长报告请示。希望首长们对我们工作中的任何缺点和错误，予以直接的指示，像过去一样地教导和帮助我。
    最后让我们：为各兄弟民族大团结的进一步巩固和加强，为全国各族人民的物质生活和文化生活日益提高，为祖国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，为我们在保卫亚洲及世界和平的事业中取得更大的
  成就而干杯！为我们各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席身体健康而干
  杯！为总理和各位首长身体健康而干杯！
