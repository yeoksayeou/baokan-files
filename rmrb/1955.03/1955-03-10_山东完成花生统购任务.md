    Shandong Completes Peanut Unified Purchase Task

    Shandong Province successfully completed its peanut unified purchase task by the end of February. The vast number of farmers actively sold peanuts to support national economic construction. For example, Dong and West Victory Villages in Qujiataizi Township, Eighth District of Fushan County, sold more than 350,000 jin of peanuts to the state. While carrying out the unified purchase of oil materials, various regions have arranged the annual unified sales of edible oil. According to statistics from eight special districts across the province, more than 93% of the townships have already issued annual edible oil supply certificates, and other regions are actively issuing them.

    山东完成花生统购任务
    山东省的花生统购任务到二月底已经胜利完成。广大农民为了支援国家经济建设，出售花生十分踊跃。仅福山县第八区曲家台子乡东、西胜利村就卖给国家三十五万多斤花生。在进行油料统购工作的同时，各地安排了全年的食油统销工作。全省据八个专区的统计，百分之九十三以上的乡已经发了全年食油供应证，其他地区正在积极颁发中。
