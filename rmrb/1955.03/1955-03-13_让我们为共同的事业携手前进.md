Let Us Join Hands and Advance for a Common Cause (I) Dear Comrade Sanin Marat Yegorovich:

    February 27th—Sunday, everywhere in our college, we saw students in groups of twos and threes enthusiastically reading and talking about the People's Daily, some even copying poems in small notebooks! Everyone felt that today's newspaper was just too little. Finally, we had to paste a copy of the newspaper on the blackboard so that everyone could see "Give Peace and Friendship to China." I read it three times in a row, feeling that every word and every sentence was exceptionally kind. Because we are merely living in different happy homelands, and our ideals, our future cause, are completely consistent—to contribute everything to greening our motherland.

    I am a freshman at the Beijing Forestry College, majoring in afforestation. Although I still lack forestry professional knowledge and there are many things I don't understand, I love my major because I realize that the sacred task of greening the motherland and ensuring high and stable yields of crops is waiting for us to complete.

    Our college is a college that has only been established for three years; however, its growth is rapid and the changes are enormous. Here, we will always remember with gratitude the direct help of Soviet forestry scientific knowledge to us. Both the textbooks and teaching methods adopt Soviet teaching methods, and there have been Soviet experts giving special reports to senior students. Letters from graduated students often mention how Soviet experts patiently and enthusiastically imparted all their techniques to them without reservation, enabling them to master modern logging techniques more quickly. All of this makes me deeply appreciate the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union that has permeated the forestry industry.

    I love the Soviet Union, just as you love China; I yearn for the Soviet Union. From the day the direct train from Beijing to Moscow opened, I hoped to take this train to reach the Soviet land, see the vast forests of the Soviet Union, and learn advanced Soviet forestry science and technology. Now, I hope even more to see your forestry college and see our dear comrades on the forestry front! Although words cannot express the eternal, unbreakable, and unprecedented friendship between our two countries, I still hope that we can correspond frequently in the future so that our friendship can be further consolidated and developed in our correspondence.

    I hate war as much as you do. We oppose war, but we are not afraid of war. At present, American imperialism not only occupies our territory of Taiwan but also attempts to prevent us from liberating Taiwan, interfere in our internal affairs, and create international tension. The Chinese people know how to deal with aggressors and have the confidence to win: American imperialism must roll back to Chicago. Because we are not alone, we have the support of the powerful socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world!

    I hope we can advance together on different forestry fronts! Be a brave vanguard, just like a song we often sing: We are forest warriors, we will march into nature, and let nature benefit mankind. I hope that four years later, perhaps in the dense forests of China or perhaps in the Soviet Union, we can meet and apply all the knowledge we have learned to forestry work! Finally, let me say: Give peace and friendship to the Soviet Union, to you, to your four-year-old son Jimul and your family, and to the college students in your forestry college!

    Chen Yanrong, Freshman in Afforestation Department, Beijing Forestry College

(II) Dear Comrade Sanin Marat Yegorovich:

    We saw your letter to us in the People's Daily on February 27th, and we were so happy! We are willing to correspond with you—a Bolshevik, an experienced forestry worker, not only because China and the Soviet Union have a deep friendship, but also because we two are forestry workers of the People's Republic of China—your colleagues.

    Of the two of us, one has been working on the forestry front for four years, and the other just graduated from a secondary forestry technical school in the summer of 1954. We are both young people.

    From the day we became masters of the country, we have been constantly thinking about our great friend, the Soviet Union, because we know that if there is the Soviet Union in the world, we will be able to complete our work better, because "Soviet Union" has the same meaning as "ideal." When we see in newspapers and magazines that our motherland is growing rapidly with the help of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet people—Soviet experts, how much love and admiration we have in our hearts for your great Soviet people! Because of you, our socialist construction will advance more rapidly; because of you and peace-loving people all over the world, we are not afraid of any enemy's threats of war and war intimidation.

    We very much like Soviet literature, movies, and songs, and we draw endless strength from them. Matrosov, Ostrovsky, Oleg, Zoya, and Chaikina are all our role models. We very much like the works of Soviet forestry scientists, such as Motovilov's "Forest Management" and Nesterov's "Introduction to Forestry," because these books have effectively helped our work.

    In addition to understanding the lives of the Soviet people, we also urgently hope to know the lives and studies of Soviet forestry workers, and to establish an eternal, unbreakable, and unprecedented friendship between us, just as you said.

    Neither of us knows Russian, but we are learning Russian. Now please allow us to write two sentences in Russian:

    Да здравствует мир и дружба! Long live peace and friendship!

    Да здравствует Союз Советских Социалистических Республик! Long live the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

    Your comrades Su Boqi Chen Genben

### 让我们为共同的事业携手前进

专栏：

    让我们为共同的事业携手前进（一）亲爱的伙伴——萨宁·马拉特·叶果罗维奇同志：
    二月二十七日——星期天，在我们的学院里，到处都看到同学们三五成群的拿着人民日报在热情的念着、谈着，有的人还拿着小本子在抄诗！大家都感到：今天的报纸实在太少了。最后，只好把一份报纸贴在黑板上，让大家都能看到“把和平和友谊给中国”。我一连看了三遍，感觉到每一字、每一句都是异常的亲切。因为我们仅仅是生活在不同的幸福的国土上，而我们的理想、我们未来的事业是完全一致的——为绿化自己的祖国而贡献出一切。
    我是在北京林学院造林专业学习的一年级大学生，虽然林业专业知识还很缺乏，不懂的东西还很多，但是，我热爱自己的专业，因为我认识到绿化祖国、保证农作物高额而稳定的丰收的神圣任务在等待着我们去完成。
    我们的学院，是一个诞生才三年的学院；但是，她的成长是迅速的，变化是巨大的。在这里，我们永远要怀着感激的心情想到的便是：苏联林业科学知识对我们直接的帮助，无论在教材、教学方式上都采用苏联教学法，并曾有过苏联专家给高班同学做专题报告。从毕业同学的来信中，也经常谈到苏联专家是怎样耐心地、热情地将全部技术毫无保留地传授给他们，使他们能更快地掌握现代化的伐木技术。这些，都使我深刻体会到渗入到林业事业中的中苏两大国之间的牢不可破的友谊。
    我热爱苏联，正像你热爱中国一样；我向往着苏联，当北京——莫斯科直达火车通车的那一天起，我就希望能乘坐这列火车，到达苏联的国土，看看苏联辽阔的森林，学习苏联先进的林业科学技术。现在，我更希望看到你所在的林业学院，看到我们亲爱的林业战线上的战友们！虽然言语万万不能表达我们中苏两国之间的永恒的、牢不可破的、空前未有的友谊，但是，我仍然希望今后我们能经常通信，让我们的友谊在通信中得到更进一步的巩固和发展。
    我和你一样地痛恨战争。我们反对战争，但是并不惧怕战争。目前美帝国主义不但霸占着我国的领土台湾，并且还企图阻止我们解放台湾，干涉我国的内政，制造国际紧张局势。对于侵略者，中国人民是知道应该怎样对付他们的，而且也有着必胜的信心：美帝国主义一定要滚回芝加哥去。因为我们不是孤单的，我们有着以苏联为首的、强大的、社会主义和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持！
    希望我们在不同的林业战线上共同前进吧！做一名英勇的尖兵，正像我们常常唱的一首歌一样：我们是森林战士，我们要向大自然进军，让大自然造福于人类。希望四年后也许在中国、也许在苏联的密林里，我们能够相见，将我们现在所学的全部知识，用到林业工作上去！最后，请让我说：把和平和友谊给苏联，给你，给你四岁的小儿子吉姆尔和你的家庭，给你所在的林业学院的大学生们！
    北京林学院造林专业一年级学生　陈燕蓉（二）亲爱的萨宁·马拉特·叶果罗维奇同志：
    我们在二月二十七日的人民日报上，看到了你给我们的来信，我们太高兴了！我们愿意和你——一个布尔什维克、有经验的林业工作者通信，这不仅因为中苏两国有着深厚的友谊，而且是因为我们两人是中华人民共和国的林业工作者——你的同行。
    我们两个人中，一个已在林业战线上工作了四年，一个是刚刚在一九五四年夏天从中等林业技术学校毕业出来的。我们两个都是青年人。
    从我们成为国家主人的那一天起，我们就在时时的想念着伟大的朋友苏联，因为我们知道世界上有苏联，我们就能够更好地完成工作，因为“苏联”同“理想”有着同样的意义。当我们从报纸上和杂志上看到我们的祖国，在苏联人民的优秀儿女——苏联专家的帮助下迅速的成长的时候，我们心里对你们伟大的苏联人民是多么热爱和敬仰呵！因为有了你们，我们的社会主义建设会更迅速地前进；因为有了你们和全世界爱好和平的人民，我们不怕任何敌人的战争威胁，和战争恫吓。
    我们非常喜欢苏联的文学、电影和歌曲，我们从中吸取了无穷无尽的力量，马特洛索夫、奥斯特洛夫斯基、奥列格、卓娅、蔡金娜都是我们的榜样。我们非常喜欢苏联林学家的著作，如莫托维洛夫的“森林经理学”、聂斯切洛夫的“林学概论”等，因为这些书，都有效地帮助了我们的工作。
    除去了解苏联人民的生活外，我们还迫切希望知道苏联林业工作者的生活和学习的情况，在我们之间建立就像你说的那样永恒的、牢不可破的、空前未有的友谊。
    我们都不会俄文，但正在学习俄文，现在请允许我们用俄文写二句话：
    Да　здравствует　мир　и　дружба！和平和友谊万岁！
    Да　здравствует　Союэ　Советских　Социалистических　Республик！苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    你的同志  苏宝岐  陈根本
