Recently, I visited China's first artificial rainfall station in the suburbs of Shanghai. Members of the Baiyiqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in the artificial rainfall irrigation area are harvesting the earliest crop of vegetables this year - cabbages and vegetable tips.

This artificial rainfall station was established on a trial basis in the autumn of 1954. Although the station has only been built for a short time, the main crops in the benefited fields have all increased production to varying degrees. Taking cabbage yield as an example, the average yield per mu using manual watering is 30 to 35 dan, while the average yield per mu using artificial rainfall irrigation is 40 to 45 dan, with the highest reaching about 70 dan. In 1954, the output value per mu of land reached more than 1.54 million old yuan, an increase of 460,000 yuan compared with 1953.

The establishment of the artificial rainfall station has further enhanced the local farmers' understanding of the benefits of getting organized and taking the road of collectivization. In 1954, there were still four small agricultural production cooperatives here. In order to give fuller play to the role of organization and to tap the potential of the land, they have now, on a voluntary basis, united into a large agricultural production cooperative, and eight individual farmers have joined their cooperative.

Farmers in Baiyiqiao area remember: In the autumn of 1953, this area suffered a drought. Regardless of gender or age, day or night, every household was using waterwheels, carrying water buckets, and the old and weak would work together in pairs, not seeing the sun at either end of the day. They worked hard all day, but one person could not even water one mu of land. Later, although the worker brothers in Shanghai also supported them in fighting the drought, some vegetables still withered and died due to the drought. Now, they only need to turn on the tap, and a misty drizzle will continuously sprinkle on the vegetable fields. In just ten minutes, they can fully satisfy the water needed by the vegetable fields. Through this fact, the farmers have a concrete understanding of the benefits of national industrialization to themselves. Now, they are striving to produce more vegetables to meet the needs of the urban people. Their vegetable planting area has been expanded by one-third compared with 1954, and the planned output has increased by 20%. In order to allow the urban people to eat more fresh vegetables, they have also added many new varieties such as Nanjing Daye spinach and Zhejiang white radish.

### 上海市郊的人工降雨站

    上海市郊的人工降雨站
    本报记者　吴于冰
    最近，我访问了上海市郊的我国第一个人工降雨站。人工降雨灌溉区里的白遗桥农业生产合作社的社员们，正在收割今年最早的一季蔬菜—卷心菜和菜尖。
    这座人工降雨站是一九五四年秋天试办的。虽然建站不久，凡是受益的田亩，主要农作物都有程度不同的增产。拿白菜的产量来说，人力挑水浇灌的，每亩平均产量三十至三十五担，人工降雨灌溉的，每亩平均产量是四十至四十五担，最高的达到七十担左右。一九五四年每亩土地的产值达到旧币一百五十四万多元，比一九五三年增加四十六万元。
    人工降雨站的建立，使当地农民进一步认识了组织起来走集体化道路的好处。这里一九五四年还是四个小型农业生产合作社，为了更充分地发挥组织起来的作用，发挥土地的潜在力量，现在他们已按自愿原则，联合成为一个大型农业生产合作社了，并有八户个体农民加入了他们的合作社。
    白遗桥一带农民记得：一九五三年秋天，这里遭受了旱灾，农民们不分男女老少，不分黑夜白天，家家都用水车车，用水桶挑，年老力弱的就两个人合起来抬，两头不见太阳，整天辛苦，一个人一天还浇不上一亩田。后来虽然上海市工人弟兄也支持他们抗旱，仍然有一部分蔬菜因旱干枯死。现在，他们只要一扭开水管龙头，蒙蒙细雨便不停地洒在菜田里。只需十几分钟的时间，就可以充分满足菜田所需要的水分。农民们通过这一事实具体地认识到国家工业化对自己的好处。现在，他们正争取生产更多的蔬菜，以满足城市人民的需要。他们的蔬菜播种面积，比一九五四年已扩大了三分之一，产量计划增加二成。为了使城市人民能吃到更多的新鲜蔬菜，他们又增加了南京大叶菠菜，浙江白萝卜等很多新品种。
