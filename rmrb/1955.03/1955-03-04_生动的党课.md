    Vivid Party Class
    The CPC Beijing Eastern Suburban District Committee summarized the grain unified purchase and sale work in December of last year, and based on the summary materials, conducted a vivid and specific policy education for the vast number of rural party members.
    In the grain unified purchase and sale work, the vast majority of party members in the district performed very well; they not only actively and patiently promoted the Party's policies to the masses, but also set an example and motivated the masses to sell surplus grain. Bi Youlong, a party member from Huayuanzha, harvested a total of 3,000 jin of grain last year. After deducting the public grain and retaining the rations, he sold all the rest to the state. Guo Yuheng, a party member from Liguanzhuang, was a grain-deficient household and needed government adjustment; after holding a family meeting to carefully calculate, the grain shortage problem was solved, and he also mobilized thirteen households to sell 3,000 jin of surplus grain. However, there were also individual party members who performed very poorly in the unified purchase and sale work, and some even refused to accept the Party's education. Chang Rong, the party branch secretary of Daitou Township, had surplus grain, but in the 1953 unified purchase and sale work, he reported a shortage of 300 jin of grain; after the unified purchase and sale work began last year, he had been holding a confrontational attitude, not only not selling surplus grain, but falsely reporting a shortage of 200 jin. Zhang Liucheng, a party member from Anjialing, bought 700 jin of grain from farmer Cui Wanfu in the unified purchase and sale work, and also falsely reported rations. Zhang Liucheng knew that what his family did was wrong, but he did not adhere to principles and stop it. In order to enforce Party discipline, the Party organization expelled Chang Rong from the Party and gave Zhang Liucheng a strict criticism.
    In order to raise the awareness of rural party members, the District Committee compiled these materials into party class teaching materials, and selected 31 party members from various unified purchase and sale work groups to serve as temporary branch instructors, and conducted education for the vast number of party members in 45 rural branches. In the lectures, the capitalist ideology was criticized in combination with the teaching materials, and the harm of these erroneous ideas was analyzed and pointed out. Through this education, the ideological awareness of the vast number of party members has been raised. (Jia Ziying, Liang Jianhua)

    生动的党课
    中共北京市东郊区委员会在去年十二月总结了粮食统购统销工作，并根据总结材料向广大农村党员进行了一次生动具体的政策教育。
    在粮食统购统销工作中，全区绝大部分党员表现很好；他们不仅积极耐心地向群众宣传党的方针政策，而且以身作则，带动群众卖余粮。花园闸党员毕有龙去年共收获三千斤粮食，除去交公粮、留口粮外，其余的全部卖给了国家。李官庄党员郭玉恒是缺粮户，需要政府调剂；经过召开家庭会议精打细算，解决了缺粮问题，还动员十三户卖了三千斤余粮。但是，也有个别党员在统购统销工作中表现很坏，有的甚至拒绝接受党的教育。岱头乡党支部书记常荣是有余粮的，但在一九五三年统购统销工作中报缺粮三百斤；去年统购统销工作开始后，他一直抱着对抗的情绪，不但不卖余粮，反而谎报缺粮二百斤。安家坟党员张留成家里在统购统销工作中，向农民崔万福抢购了七百斤粮食，并且多报口粮。张留成明知道家里这样做不对，却没有坚持原则，加以制止。为了严肃党的纪律，党组织把常荣开除出党，给予张留成以严格批评。
    为了提高农村党员的觉悟，区委会把这些材料编成党课教材，并从各统购统销工作组中选拔了三十一名党员担任临时支部教员，在四十五个农村支部中，向广大党员进行了教育。在讲课中，结合教材批判了资本主义思想，分析和指出这些错误思想的危害性。通过这一教育，提高了广大党员的思想觉悟。　（贾子英、梁建华）
