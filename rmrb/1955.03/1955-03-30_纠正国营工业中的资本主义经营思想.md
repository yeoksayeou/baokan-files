Correcting Capitalist Management Thought in State-Owned Industries

    Not long ago, the leading local Party committees of several provinces and cities inspected a number of state-owned and local state-owned industrial enterprises' capitalist management thought, and exposed many erroneous facts of enterprises such as Daye Steel Plant, Xinhu Steel Plant, and Xuanhua Machinery Plant that violated national policies. The leaders of these enterprises, due to guiding the production and management of the enterprises with capitalist thought, caused phenomena such as chaotic enterprise production, poor product quality, constant accidents, and failure to complete plans. This phenomenon not only caused great losses to brother factories and mines and the masses who were associated with these factories, but also caused the production and operation of these factories to fall into serious crisis. Although this inspection is limited to a part of industrial enterprises, their experiences and lessons should attract the attention of all state-owned enterprises.
    The management thought and style of an enterprise are adapted to the purpose of its production. Capitalist production aims at the pursuit of high profits, which determines that it must adopt methods of mutual exclusion, annexation, and deception. Profit-seeking is the highest purpose of all their activities. Socialist production, on the other hand, aims at meeting the growing needs of society and all the people, which determines that it must adopt methods of continuous growth and improvement of production on a highly technical basis to promote the prosperity of the entire national economy and the improvement of the people's lives. China's state-owned industrial enterprises are socialist enterprises, and they must develop production in accordance with socialist principles. That is to say, it should rely on the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, rely on the correct guidance of the national plan and the mutual coordination and cooperation of various departments of the national economy, and rely on the technological transformation of the enterprise and the improvement of management to continuously improve labor productivity and expand reproduction. Only by adopting such methods can the enterprise achieve the goal of serving national construction and people's lives.
    Some cadres of our state-owned enterprises, due to their unclear understanding of the purpose of socialist production, have adopted various wrong methods that are completely incompatible with socialist enterprises to pursue profits (the higher authorities' setting excessively high profits for the enterprise regardless of the specific situation has also fueled this tendency). In order to seek profits, some enterprises do not hesitate to cut corners, use inferior goods to impersonate good ones, and raise product prices, building the enterprise's "profits" on the losses of brother enterprises and the masses. For example, a batch of iron pipes sold by Xuanhua Machinery Plant to basic construction departments were originally defective products that leaked water. They were soaked in bittern to oxidize and rust, blocking the holes, and then delivered as finished products. Some state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai have also long used a variety of deceptive methods to sell bad cloth as good cloth. Some enterprises, in order to increase output value and gain more profits, do not produce according to the variety plan stipulated by the state, but blindly produce products that are of great value, easy to produce, but often not needed by society. For example, some state-owned pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai are unwilling to produce products with low output value but good sales, but focus on producing expensive but difficult-to-sell drugs. Some tool factories do not produce small tools with small output value, but only produce large tools with large output value. In this way, it seems that the output value has increased from the perspective of one enterprise, but the national plan has been damaged, and the separation of production and sales and the backlog of funds have been caused. There are also a few enterprises that, in order to pursue increased output value, disregard the health and safety of workers, work overtime and rush to work, and even cause accidents. All of these are essentially a reflection of capitalist management thought, which is extremely harmful to the production of socialist enterprises.
    Some comrades said: "Shouldn't state-owned enterprises make profits? Isn't earning more profits helpful to increase accumulation for the country?" Yes, state-owned enterprises should make profits, and should strive to overfulfill the profit plan. Guaranteeing the profitability of an enterprise is one of the requirements of economic accounting, which illustrates the economic effect of the enterprise's work in a certain period of time. Stalin said: "The profitability of individual enterprises and individual production departments is of great significance from the point of view of developing our country's production. This should be noted both in planned construction and planned production. This is the basic knowledge of economic activity at the current stage of our country's development." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR") But the problem is that we must recognize that the profits of socialist enterprises are fundamentally different from the profits of capitalist enterprises. Capitalist profits are built on the basis of fraud and exploitation of the working people, while the profits of socialist enterprises must be based on the principles of economic accounting, adopt legitimate methods such as improving product quality, saving raw materials, tapping the potential of production equipment, improving labor organization, improving labor productivity, and reducing product costs to tap the internal potential of the enterprise and strive to complete the delivery of profits. At the same time, in the socialist economy, in addition to the profits of individual enterprises and individual production departments, it is also necessary to achieve the higher profits of the entire national economy, which are impossible for capitalism. Here, profits cannot only be viewed from individual departments or individual enterprises, but should first focus on the profitability of the entire national economy. That is to say, the profits of individual departments and individual enterprises must be subordinate to the plan of the entire national economy, and production must be carried out according to the varieties and specifications stipulated in the plan. Even if these products have less profit, they must still be produced accordingly. This is the profit of socialist enterprises. Short-term profits must be subordinate to long-term profits. Therefore, this practice of obtaining enterprise "profits" at the expense of the interests of brother enterprises and the state is completely contrary to the socialist principle of profit.
    There are also some cadres of state-owned and local state-owned industrial enterprises who believe that although their management style is not good, as long as they "complete the production plan", they are also worthy of praise. This idea is of course completely wrong. In fact, if the management thought is not correct, it will never improve production, but will only damage production, damage the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, and ultimately put the enterprise in a difficult situation. Last year, Daye Steel Plant allowed a large number of defective products to leave the factory, which not only caused great losses to many brother factories, but also ruined its own reputation. As a result, ordering units filed for returns, resulting in financial losses of 10 billion yuan due to returns last year, and sales became worse and worse. Orders in the fourth quarter were only equivalent to 59% of the planned output. Some enterprises are in a more embarrassing situation than Daye Steel Plant. Their mistakes have been criticized by brother factories and mines and the masses, and criticized by the Party and higher authorities, and those with serious circumstances will be sanctioned by national laws. Obviously, this cannot be called "completing the production plan." Completing the production plan must include the quantity and quality of products, and complete the tasks assigned by the state on time and economically. Therefore, if a socialist enterprise wants to develop its business, it can only take the bright path of socialism, and never take the evil path of capitalism.
    The occurrence of capitalist management thought in state-owned industrial enterprises is not accidental. Because our bourgeoisie still exists, state-owned enterprises must often come into contact with capitalist enterprises in their work; at the same time, in people's minds, the remnants of capitalist thought have not been completely overcome, especially those staff members who have long held positions in private enterprises in the past retain more old influences, which are the sources of capitalist thought in state-owned enterprises. Eliminating this ideological influence is a long-term and complex struggle. The most important thing at present is to give play to the guarantee and supervision role of the Party organizations of state-owned enterprises and strengthen socialist education for enterprise cadres and employees. The inspection materials from various places show that the ideological germs of capitalism have invaded the inside of certain state-owned enterprises and have grown and spread, without exception, due to the weakness of the political work of the enterprise Party organizations. The Party organizations of these enterprises did not combine political work with economic work. They were busy with trivial work all day long and did not go deep into economic work to study and solve problems. They did not see the various ideological struggles that existed in life, and did not regularly carry out principled criticism and self-criticism in the enterprise, especially among leading cadres. They did not stop and oppose behaviors that violated the Party's policies in a timely manner, which made these Party organizations completely weak and powerless in this serious struggle. This situation must be changed.
    Cadres of state-owned and local state-owned industrial enterprises, especially leading cadres, must strive to study the theoretical knowledge of socialist economy, and must learn to use socialist economic laws with complete knowledge to guide all economic work of the enterprise. The more deeply we understand these laws, the more we can use these laws, the more effective our work will be. Otherwise, we still run the risk of losing our way and falling into the quagmire of capitalism. The work of criticizing capitalist management thought in state-owned enterprises in Shanghai and other places provides us with a learnable example. We should put this ideological work of great significance on the regular and important agenda of leadership work, as an indispensable part of leading economic work, and promote the continuous advancement of the national industrialization cause.

### 纠正国营工业中的资本主义经营思想

    纠正国营工业中的资本主义经营思想
    不久以前，若干省、市地方党委领导检查了一批国营和地方国营工业的资本主义经营思想，揭露了大冶钢厂、新沪钢厂、宣化机器厂等企业违反国家政策的许多错误事实。这些企业的领导人，由于以资本主义思想来指导企业的生产和经营，造成企业生产混乱、产品质量低劣、事故不断发生、计划不能完成的现象，这种现象不但使与这些工厂发生联系的兄弟厂矿和群众蒙受了极大损失，也使这些工厂的生产和经营陷于严重的危机。这次的检查，虽然还只限于一部分工业企业，但是它们的经验教训却应该引起所有国营企业的注意。
    企业的经营思想和经营作风，是与企业的生产目的相适应的。资本主义生产以追求高额利润为目的，这就决定了它必然要采用互相排挤、吞并和欺骗的方法。唯利是图，这就是它们一切活动的最高宗旨。而社会主义生产，则是以满足社会和全体人民日益增长的需要为目的的，这就决定了它必须采取在高度技术基础上使生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来促进整个国民经济的繁荣和人民生活的改善。我国国营工业企业是社会主义性质的企业，它必须按照社会主义的原则来发展生产。这就是说，它应当依靠工人群众的劳动积极性和创造性，依靠国家计划的正确指导和国民经济各部门相互的配合和协作，依靠企业的技术改造和管理工作的改进，从而不断地提高劳动生产率，扩大再生产。只有采取这样的方法，才能使企业达到为国家建设和人民生活服务的目的。
    我们有些国营企业的干部，由于对社会主义生产的目的认识不清，于是他们就采取了与社会主义企业完全不相容的种种错误方法去追求利润（上级不顾具体情况给该企业规定了过高的利润也助长了这种倾向）。有些企业为了谋取利润，不惜偷工减料，以次货充好货，并抬高产品价格，把企业的“利润”建筑在兄弟企业和群众的损失上。例如宣化机器厂卖给基本建设部门的一批铁管，原来都是漏水渗水的废品，他们用盐卤泡过，使其氧化生锈，堵住了窟窿，然后当作成品交货。上海有些国营棉纺织厂，也长久以来沿用着好多种蒙混的办法，把坏布当好布卖出。也有些企业，为了增加产值，多得利润，不按照国家规定的品种计划生产，盲目地生产那种价值大的、容易生产的、但常为社会不需要的产品，例如上海有的国营制药厂，不愿生产产值低而有销路的产品，却专心生产贵重的但销路困难的药品。有的工具厂不生产产值小的小工具，而只生产产值大的大工具。这样，从一个企业看来好像产值增加了，但国家计划受到了破坏，并造成产销脱节和资金的积压。也有少数企业，为了追求增加产值，不顾工人的健康和安全，加班突击，甚至因而酿成事故。所有这些，本质上都是资本主义经营思想的反映，它对社会主义企业的生产是极其有害的。
    有的同志说：“国营企业难道不应当获取利润吗？多挣利润，不是可以为国家增加积累吗？”是的，国营企业应当获取利润，而且应当力争超额完成利润计划。保证企业赢利是经济核算的要求之一，它说明一定时期内企业工作的经济效果。斯大林说过：“个别企业和个别生产部门的赢利，从发展我国生产的观点来说，是有巨大意义的。无论在计划建设或计划生产时，这都是应该注意到的。这是我国现今发展阶段上经济活动方面的起码知识。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”）但问题在于我们必须认识社会主义企业的利润，与资本主义企业的利润有原则性的区别。资本主义的利润是建筑在欺诈蒙骗和剥削劳动人民的基础上的，社会主义企业的利润，则必须在经济核算的原则下，采取提高产品质量，节约原材料，发挥生产设备的潜在能力，改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，降低产品成本等正当的方法，来发掘企业内部潜力，争取完成上缴利润。同时，在社会主义经济中，除了个别企业和个别生产部门的赢利外，还要达到高级的、资本主义所不可能有的整个国民经济规模的赢利，在这里，赢利不能只从个别部门或个别企业来看，而首先应当从整个国民经济的赢利着眼。这就是说，个别部门和个别企业的赢利必须服从整个国民经济的计划，按计划规定的品种、规格进行生产，即使这些产品赢利较少也必须照此生产，这才是社会主义企业的赢利。眼前短暂的赢利必须服从长远的赢利。所以以损害兄弟企业和国家利益为代价来取得企业“赢利”的这种做法，是完全违背社会主义赢利原则的。
    还有些国营和地方国营工业企业的干部，他们认为自己的经营作风虽然不好，但是只要“完成了生产计划”，也同样是值得称赞的。这种想法当然也是完全错误的。事实上，经营思想不对头，就决不能提高生产，而只会破坏生产，损害工人群众的劳动积极性和创造性，最后使企业陷于困境。大冶钢厂去年由于让大量废品出厂，不但给许多兄弟工厂造成了很大损失，自己的信誉也一败涂地，结果订货单位纷纷提出退货，去年因订户退货造成的财务损失达一百亿元，销售情况越来越坏，第四季度的订货，只相当于计划产量的百分之五十九。有些企业狼狈的情形，还甚于大冶钢厂。他们的错误受到了兄弟厂矿和群众的指责，受到了党和上级的批评，情节严重的更要受到国家法律的制裁。显然，这不能叫做“完成了生产计划”，完成生产计划必须是包括产品的数量和质量，按期地经济地完成国家所给予的任务。所以，社会主义企业要使企业的业务得到发展，只有走社会主义的光明正道，决不能走资本主义的邪道。
    国营工业企业中资本主义经营思想的发生，并不是偶然的。因为我国资产阶级还存在，国营企业在工作上还必须经常与资本主义企业发生接触；同时在人们的头脑中，资本主义思想残余远没有完全克服，尤其是过去曾经长期在私营企业中担任过职务的工作人员，保留的旧的影响更多，这些就是国营企业中资本主义思想的来源。肃清这种思想影响，乃是一件长期的复杂的斗争。当前最重要的就是要发挥国营企业党组织的保证监督作用，加强对企业干部和职工的社会主义教育。这次各地的检查材料都说明，资本主义的思想病菌所以侵入了某些国营企业的内部，并且滋长蔓延，无例外地都是由于企业党组织政治工作的薄弱。这些企业的党组织没有把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，他们整天忙于琐碎的事务工作中，不深入经济工作中去研究和解决问题。他们看不见生活中存在的各种思想斗争，不在企业中、首先是领导干部中经常开展原则性的批评与自我批评。对于违反党的政策的行为，不及时制止和反对，这就使得这些党组织在这个严重的斗争上，完全处于软弱无力的地位。这种情况是必须改变的。
    国营和地方国营工业企业的干部，特别是领导干部，必须努力钻研社会主义经济的理论知识，必须学会以完备的知识运用社会主义经济法则来指导企业的全部经济工作，我们愈是深刻地懂得了这些法则，愈是能够运用这些法则，我们的工作就必定愈有成效。否则，我们就仍然有迷失方向、堕入资本主义泥坑的危险。上海等地国营企业批判资本主义经营思想的工作为我们提供了一个可资学习的例证，我们应当把这项意义重大的思想工作，摆在领导工作经常的、重要的日程上，作为领导经济工作不可缺少的一部分，推动国家工业化事业的不断前进。
