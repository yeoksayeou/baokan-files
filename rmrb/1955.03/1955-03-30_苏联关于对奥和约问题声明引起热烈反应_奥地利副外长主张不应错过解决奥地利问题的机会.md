Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 28th: Agence France-Presse broadcast a statement by Austrian Deputy Foreign Minister Kreisky at a Socialist Party meeting. Speaking about the issue of concluding a treaty with Austria, Kreisky said that Austrians "should not miss the opportunity others are giving us and should do everything possible to discuss the possibility of resolving the Austrian question without prejudice."

Kreisky expressed hope that "the Austrian question can become the beginning of fruitful new great power negotiations."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the Austrian treaty issue on the 25th, and the statement welcoming Austrian Chancellor Raab to visit Moscow in the near future, have aroused enthusiastic responses abroad. Comments in many foreign newspapers point out that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the resolution of the Austrian question and seeks to avoid further delaying the conclusion of a treaty with Austria.

Broad sections of Austrian society have expressed particular concern. Austrian newspapers published detailed content of the Soviet statement under large headlines. According to Austrian newspapers, the Austrian cabinet will hold a meeting on the 29th to discuss the Soviet proposals on the Austrian issue.

Newspapers of the ruling Austrian party pointed out that Prime Minister Raab will accept the invitation to visit Moscow. Vienna's "Neues Wiener Tagblatt" said that Austrian government officials are satisfied with this invitation. It pointed out that Western countries are showing undisguised anxiety, while Vienna believes that the development of events is undoubtedly a major advance.

The Austrian Socialist Party newspaper "Arbeiter-Zeitung" commented that all Austrian parties welcome the invitation of Austrian government officials to Moscow, which gives the Austrian people hope.

The Austrian Communist Party organ "Volksstimme" said that the Soviet statement was warmly endorsed by the Austrian people. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet proposal is of particular significance because the Paris Agreements make the danger of West Germany to Austria more real, and the United States wants to turn western Austria into a bridgehead for the Atlantic bloc. The newspaper believes that the Soviet proposal has overthrown the footing of those who are intent on delaying and sabotaging the negotiations on a treaty with Austria. In an editorial entitled "Go to Moscow," "Volksstimme" warned that the United States is, and will continue to, exert increasing pressure on the Austrian government to obstruct the conclusion of a treaty with Austria. The newspaper said: Austrian public opinion expects the government to refuse to support the "position of strength" policy and to safeguard Austria's national interests.

The Soviet statement has also attracted the attention of public opinion in Western countries. The British "Daily Express" commentator Max said that Molotov took a major step towards concluding a treaty with Austria. Agence France-Presse commentator Mauriac believes that the Soviet proposal is a "prominent international event."

Western officials have not yet expressed their opinions, but according to newspaper reports, they were deeply disturbed after learning of Vienna's positive response to the Soviet proposal and the favorable prospects for resolving the Austrian issue. The British "Daily Express" even expressed concern about the end of the occupation of Austria. The Austrian "Salzburger Nachrichten," which is close to the US occupation authorities in Austria, said that the complete withdrawal of troops stationed in Austria and the complete neutralization of Austria "will open another crack in the West's Central European positions after the Paris Agreements have just taken effect."

Some people in the United States, unable to present any reasons against the Soviet proposal, generally expressed skepticism about the Soviet proposal.

    苏联关于对奥和约问题声明引起热烈反应
    奥地利副外长主张不应错过解决奥地利问题的机会
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法新社播发了奥地利外交部副部长克赖斯基在社会党会议上所发表的声明。克赖斯基在谈到缔结对奥和约问题时说，奥地利人“不应错过别人给予我们的机会，并应该尽一切力量以求没有偏见地讨论解决奥地利问题的可能。”
    克赖斯基表示，希望“奥地利问题能成为有成果的新的大国谈判的开端。”
    据新华社讯：苏联外交部二十五日对奥和约问题的声明和表示欢迎奥地利总理拉布在最近期间访问莫斯科的声明，在国外引起了热烈的反应。许多外国报纸的评论指出，苏联十分重视奥地利问题的解决，力求避免继续延迟缔结对奥和约问题。
    广大的奥地利各界人士表示特别关心。奥地利各报以大标题刊载了苏联声明的详细内容。据奥地利报纸报道，奥地利内阁将在二十九日举行会议，讨论苏联关于奥地利问题的建议。
    奥地利执政党的报纸指出，拉布总理将接受访问莫斯科的邀请。维也纳的“新日报”说，奥地利政府人士对这个邀请是满意的。它指出，西方国家对此表示出掩盖不住的惶惶不安，而在维也纳则认为事件的发展无疑是一大进展。
    奥地利社会党报纸“工人报”评论说，奥地利所有党派都欢迎邀请奥地利政府官员到莫斯科去，这给予奥地利人民以希望。
    奥地利共产党机关报“奥地利人民之声报”说，苏联声明受到奥地利人民的热烈赞同。报纸指出，由于巴黎协定使得西德对奥地利的危险更加现实和美国想把奥地利西部变成大西洋集团的桥头堡，因此苏联的建议具有特别的意义。报纸认为苏联建议已经推翻了那些一心要拖延和破坏对奥和约谈判的人的立足点。“奥地利人民之声报”在一篇题目是
  “到莫斯科去”的社论中警告说：美国正在、并且将来还要对奥地利政府施以越来越大的压力，以阻挠对奥和约的缔结。报纸说：奥地利舆论在期待政府拒绝支持“实力地位”政策，并维护奥地利的民族利益。
    苏联的声明也引起西方国家舆论的重视。英国“每日快报”评论员马克斯认为莫洛托夫采取了缔结对奥和约的重大步骤。法新社评论员莫里阿克认为苏联建议是“突出的国际事件”。
    西方国家的官方人士直到现在没有表示自己的意见，但是根据报纸消息，他们在得悉维也纳对苏联建议的良好反应以及奥地利问题的解决已开辟了有利的前途以后，深感不安。英国“每日快报”竟对奥地利的占领将要结束表示忧虑。接近美国驻奥地利占领当局的奥地利“萨尔斯堡新闻”说，全部撤退驻奥军队和使奥地利完全中立化，“将使在巴黎协定刚生效后，在西方的中欧阵地上又打开一个裂口”。
    美国某些人士无法提出任何反对苏联建议的理由，便笼统地表示对苏联建议有怀疑。
