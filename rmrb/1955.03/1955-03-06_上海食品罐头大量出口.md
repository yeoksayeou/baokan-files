    Shanghai Canned Food Exports Increase Significantly
    The Shanghai Branch of the China National Food Export Corporation has actively organized the export of canned food in recent years. Currently, the exported canned foods include more than thirty varieties, such as braised pork, white-braised chicken, white-braised duck, and tomato sauce. These canned foods have all been inspected by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau before export, ensuring excellent quality and making them very popular with people abroad. Last year alone, the total value of various canned foods exported by the Shanghai Branch of the China National Food Export Corporation could earn the country the equivalent of over 40,000 tons of steel, or over 80,000 tons of gasoline. By mid-February of this year, the export volume of canned food had already increased by more than six times compared to the export volume in the first quarter of last year. (Jinhua)

    上海食品罐头大量出口
    中国食品出口公司上海分公司几年来积极组织罐头食品出口。现在出口的食品罐头，已经有红烧猪肉、白烧鸡、白烧鸭、西红柿酱等三十多种。这些食品罐头，出口以前都曾经过上海商品检验局检验，品质优良，很受国外人民的欢迎。去年一年，中国食品出口公司上海分公司出口的各种食品罐头的总值，约可为国家换回四万多吨钢材，或八万多吨汽油。今年到二月中旬止，食品罐头的出口数量，已经比去年第一季度的出口数量增加六倍以上。　（金华）
