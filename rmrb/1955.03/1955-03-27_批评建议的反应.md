Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    △ Yang Zhuoran, Head of the Culture and Education Section of the Xiangtan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, wrote: After reading the People's Daily article "Are Appearance and Demeanor Criteria for Student Admission?", I deeply felt that we still have relatively serious bourgeois ideas. The criticism in the Party newspaper not only improved my ideological understanding but also educated the broad masses of educational workers. My section plans, based on Tan Zheng's exam scores from last year, to have the prefectural office instruct Xiangtan City Middle School to retain his student status. After passing the physical examination, he will be allowed to enroll with this year's freshman class, and Tan Zheng has already been notified.
    △ Letter from the Xiaogan Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Hubei Province: The criticism and suggestions made by Comrade Xiao Sixiao on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 23rd regarding "No one is responsible for the work of boat people in Xiaogan" are correct. In order to overcome shortcomings, improve work, and strengthen leadership, we have convened relevant departments for inspection and research. We have decided to rectify and consolidate areas where political power has already been established and conscientiously and responsibly address the political and cultural needs of the boat people. For areas where political power has not yet been established, it will be gradually established; staffing issues will be resolved uniformly through adjustments to administrative divisions and completed by the end of June of this year.
  　△ Letter from the Guangdong Provincial Company of the China Food Company: The "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on January 16th criticized the serious shortcomings in our company's banana business. We have conducted an inspection. Last year, when we carried out the guaranteed purchase of bananas in key production areas (Dongguan County), we indeed did not accurately determine the output, which later led to a situation where we could neither guarantee the purchase nor refuse to purchase. At the same time, we and other industrial and commercial administrative departments failed to properly guide private merchants in the banana business, so that when the peak season arrived, not only the guaranteed purchase areas could not refuse to accept the bananas, but our company also had to bear the acquisition tasks of several other counties, which also caused the accumulation and spoilage of bananas.
    It is true that some of the bananas shipped by our company to Northeast, North China, Central South, and Northwest China had a relatively serious degree of spoilage. Our work in this area has shortcomings. The relevant personnel have made self-criticisms.
    △ Letter from the Northeast Lumber Industry Administration Bureau: The criticism of our "Unmanaged Health Institutions" in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on February 20th is correct. In the past, we did indeed not pay enough attention to industrial hygiene and medical management. This issue has now attracted our attention, and we have decided to rectify this work. We plan to convene a meeting of health workers from all subordinate factories in March to implement a plan to improve industrial hygiene.
    △ Letter from Harbin Institute of Technology: The exposure by the Harbin Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, published in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on February 6th, that our school's 1954 construction project budget was too large and was not corrected in time, resulting in the contractor being paid for the project in advance, is consistent with the facts. The main reasons for this error are that we did not carefully study the instructions and documents from higher authorities, we did not fully recognize the importance of basic construction planning, we lacked thorough investigation and research beforehand, we were blind in formulating plans, and we did not adequately understand the policies of implementing thrift and tapping potential in basic construction, which resulted in unnecessary losses to the country.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    △湘潭专署文教科长杨卓然来信：读了人民日报关于“颜面和仪表是录取学生的标准吗？”一文后，深深感到我们还存在着比较严重的资产阶级的思想。党报的批评，不仅提高了我的思想认识，而且也教育了广大的教育工作者。我科准备根据谭正去年考试成绩，由专署指示湘潭市中学保留他的学籍，体格检查合格后，准许他同今年高中新生一齐入学，并已通知谭正同学。
    △湖北省孝感专员公署来信：一月二十三日读者来信专页上萧思孝同志对“孝感船民工作无人负责”的批评建议是正确的。为了克服缺点，改进工作，加强领导，我们已召集有关部门作了检查、研究，决定对于已建政的地区，加以整顿巩固，认真负责的解决有关船民政治和文化方面的要求。对于未建政地区，则逐步建立；编制问题从调整区划中统一解决，并限期于本年六月底以前完成这一工作。
  　△中国食品公司广东省公司来信：一月十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”上批评我公司经营香蕉业务方面存在着严重的缺点，我们已进行检查。去年我们在重点产区（东莞县）进行香蕉包购时的确没有认真摸清产量，以致后来造成包购不了不收购又不行的局面。同时，还由于我们同其他工商行政部门未能很好领导私商经营香蕉业务，以致当旺产季到来时，不但包购产区不收不行，其余几个县的收购任务也要由我公司负担起来，这也是造成香蕉积压和腐烂的原因。
    我公司发运往东北、华北、中南、西北各区的香蕉，有一部分腐烂情况较为严重，这是事实。我们在这方面的工作是有缺点的。各经办人员已作了检讨。
    △东北制材工业管理局来信：二月二十日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊登的“无人领导的卫生机构”一文中对我们的批评是正确的。我们过去的确不重视工业卫生和医疗管理等工作。现在这个问题已引起我们的注意，并决定整顿这项工作，拟在三月份召开所属各厂卫生工作人员会议，贯彻改进工业卫生的工作方案。
    △哈尔滨工业大学来信：二月六日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊载中国人民建设银行哈尔滨分行揭发我校一九五四年建设工程概算过大，没有及时纠正，造成承包单位提前支付包工款一事，是符合事实的。产生这一错误的原因，主要是我们对上级的指示、文件没有认真钻研和学习，对基本建设计划工作的重要性认识不足，事先缺乏周密的调查研究，在编制计划时存在盲目性，对基本建设中贯彻节约精神和发挥潜在力量等政策体会不够，结果给国家造成了不应有的损失。
