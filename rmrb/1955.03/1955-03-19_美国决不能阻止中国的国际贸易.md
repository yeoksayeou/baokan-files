    The United States Must Not Prevent China's International Trade
    Gao Ji

    The United States is frantically trying to stop the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba" from sailing to China. The U.S. State Department unashamedly revealed that U.S. Ambassador to Finland, Mr. McFall, had "contacted several times" the Finnish Foreign Ministry in order to prevent the "Aruba" from coming to China. This clearly shows that the U.S. government is entirely responsible for this crime of disrupting normal international trade and freedom of navigation. The U.S. government's blatant hostility towards the Chinese people has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people.

    It is known that the United States has repeatedly disrupted normal trade and shipping between China and foreign countries in recent years. In this "Aruba" incident, the means used by the United States are even more crude. Not only have the U.S. State Department and senators like Nolan repeatedly threatened Finland, forbidding the "Aruba" from coming to China, but even the U.S. Secretary of State has openly stated that the seizure of the "Aruba" by U.S. warships "cannot be considered an act of war." In order to prevent the "Aruba" from sailing, the United States even sent a task force including five warships to Singapore, and threatened in a piratical manner that if anything happened to the "Aruba" in Singapore under these circumstances, "it would be coincidental." At the same time, the United States also instigated the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to clamor to sink the "Aruba" at sea. Obviously, the United States has turned the high seas of the Far East into a den of bandits where the United States can arbitrarily seize merchant ships and obstruct freedom of navigation.

    This lawless practice of the United States violates the norms of international law, seriously threatens the safety of the high seas in the Far East, and thus harms the interests of trade and navigation of all countries in the world.

    In order to sabotage this shipping, the monopoly capital of the United States and Britain openly issued orders on behalf of the Indonesian government, forbidding the "Aruba" from refueling in Indonesian ports. The American New Jersey-New York Mobil Oil Company and the British Shell Company in Singapore did just that. According to what rights and what logic did they do this? This action of the U.S. and British monopoly capital was of course instructed by their own governments. This is the most blatant manifestation of U.S. and British imperialism disregarding the sovereignty of other countries. Indonesian Minister of Information, Mr. Doebing, righteously and sternly condemned this illegal act, believing that it "infringes upon Indonesian sovereignty."

    The United States spares no effort to prevent the "Aruba" from coming to China, obviously attempting to intensify its "blockade and embargo" against China in order to prevent the development of normal trade between various countries and China. However, this practice of the United States can only be futile. The facts of the past few years have long proved that the U.S. "blockade and embargo" policy has not affected China's economic construction in the slightest, but has instead harmed the economies of those countries that have traditional trade relations with China. Now, the call for developing normal trade with China is getting louder and louder in various countries, and the trade relations between China and various countries will continue to expand, which the United States cannot prevent by any means.

    美国决不能阻止中国的国际贸易
    高集
    美国在疯狂的阻止芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”开到中国来。美国国务院毫不掩饰地透露，为了阻止“阿鲁巴号”到中国来，美国驻芬兰大使麦克弗尔曾同芬兰外交部“联系了好几次”。这就清楚地说明了，这次破坏国际正常贸易和航运自由的罪责，完全是在美国政府的身上。美国政府如此露骨地和中国人民为敌，激起了中国人民的极大愤慨。
    人们知道，几年来美国曾经多次破坏中国同外国的正常贸易和航运往来。在这一次“阿鲁巴号”事件中，美国所使用的手段是更为粗暴了。不但美国国务院和诺兰之流的参议员们一再恫吓芬兰，不许“阿鲁巴号”前来中国，甚至连美国国务卿也公然出面，说美国军舰劫扣“阿鲁巴号”“不能算是战争行为”。为了阻止“阿鲁巴号”的航行，美国竟把一支包括五艘军舰的特遣舰队开到新加坡，并以海盗式的姿态扬言，如果在这种情形下“阿鲁巴号”在新加坡发生了任何事，“那将是偶合”。与此同时，美国还指使蒋介石卖国集团叫嚣要在海面上炸沉“阿鲁巴号”。显然，美国已经把远东公海当作了美国任意劫扣商船、阻挠航行自由的匪盗巢穴。
    美国这种无法无天的做法，违反了国际法的准则，严重地威胁着远东公海的安全，从而损害了世界各国通商航运的利益。
    为了破坏这次航运，美国和英国的垄断资本竟公然代替印度尼西亚政府发号施令，不许“阿鲁巴号”在印度尼西亚的港口加油。在新加坡的美国新泽西—纽约美孚油公司和英国壳牌公司就是这样做了的。它们这样做究竟是根据什么权利，什么逻辑？美英垄断资本的这种行动当然是受了它们本国政府的指使的。这是美英帝国主义无视他国主权的最粗暴的表现。印度尼西亚政府情报部长杜斌正义地、严厉地斥责了这种不法行为，认为这“侵犯了印度尼西亚的主权”。
    美国不惜使尽一切手段来阻止“阿鲁巴号”前来中国，显然是企图加紧对中国的“封锁禁运”，以阻止各国和中国的正常贸易的发展。但是，美国的这种做法只能是心劳日拙。几年来的事实早已证明，美国的“封锁禁运”的政策丝毫没有使中国的经济建设受到影响，反而对那些和中国有传统贸易关系的国家的经济造成了损害。现在，各国要求和中国发展正常贸易的呼声越来越高了，中国和各国之间的贸易关系必将继续不断地扩展，这是美国以任何手段所阻止不了的。
