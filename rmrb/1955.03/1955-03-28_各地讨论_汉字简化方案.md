    Discussions on "Hanzi Simplification Plan" in Various Regions
    Since the Chinese Writing Reform Committee issued the "Draft Plan for Hanzi Simplification" in January to widely solicit opinions, it has aroused widespread attention from all sectors of the country.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education organized the Jiangsu Provincial Committee for Discussing the "Draft Plan for Hanzi Simplification." The Sichuan Provincial Department of Education also organized representatives of language teachers attending the provincial middle school teacher representative meeting and language teachers in Chengdu to discuss this "draft." In addition to holding symposiums in Xi'an, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education also designated Weinan, Baoji, and Hanzhong cities for the special district cultural and educational offices to organize symposiums; in addition to organizing major universities, colleges, and larger middle and primary schools to conduct discussions, they also widely solicited opinions from relevant people from all walks of life. The Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau convened an enlarged bureau affairs meeting, inviting responsible comrades from many directly affiliated units such as publishing houses, newspapers, bookstores, printing factories, cultural and historical museums, theater troupes, libraries, and film companies to study and discuss the "draft." The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has already invited language teachers from some middle schools, primary schools, and industrial and agricultural spare-time schools to hold four seminars.
    As of March 20, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee had received more than 3,000 opinions from all walks of life, of which more than 300 were from institutions, schools, and organizations. It can be seen from these opinions that more than 90% of the people, including many students, teachers, and cadres, support the simplification of Chinese characters, and many people have also expressed their opinions in conjunction with their work and study. There is a consensus that simplifying Chinese characters is helpful for work and study. Everyone also raised many suggestions for revising the "draft," and the Chinese Writing Reform Committee is sorting out these opinions for adoption or reference when revising the "draft." (Qí Zhú)

    各地讨论“汉字简化方案”
    中国文字改革委员会自从一月份颁发了“汉字简化方案草案”广泛征求意见以来，已引起了全国各方面的重视。
    江苏省教育厅组织了江苏省讨论“汉字简化方案草案”委员会。四川省教育厅也组织了全省出席中等学校教师代表会议的语文教师代表们和成都全市语文教师们对这个“草案”进行讨论。陕西省教育厅除在西安市举行座谈会外，还指定渭南、宝鸡市、汉中市由专署文教科组织座谈会；除组织各大、专学校及规模较大的中、小学进行讨论外，还广泛征集了有关各界人士的意见。江西省文化事业管理局召开了局务扩大会议，邀请了出版社、报社、书店、印刷厂、文史馆、剧团、图书馆、影片公司等许多直属单位的负责同志对“草案”进行了研究、讨论。上海市教育局已经邀请了部分中学、小学、工农业余学校的语文教师举行了四次座谈会。
    到三月二十日为止，中国文字改革委员会收到各行各界寄来的意见三千份以上，其中属于机关、学校、团体的意见有三百多份。从这些意见中可以看出，百分之九十以上的人，包括许多学生、教师和干部都拥护简化汉字，很多人还结合自己的工作和学习发表了意见。一致认为：简化汉字对于工作和学习是有帮助的。对“草案”的修改意见，大家也提了许多，中国文字改革委员会正在整理这些意见，供修订“草案”时采纳或参考。（淇竹）
