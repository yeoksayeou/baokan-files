Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 17th: When Shanxi Province was rectifying and consolidating more than 20,000 newly established agricultural production cooperatives, it universally paid attention to addressing the deviations of excluding poor peasants and harming the interests of middle peasants in the handling of production materials.

When the Nanguan Labor Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huguan County was evaluating land yields, middle-peasant cooperative member Lei Cangze actively advocated using the current actual yield as the basis. However, poor peasants such as Li Tiansuo, because of good soil quality but low actual yield, advocated evaluating based on land yield and natural conditions. After studying everyone's opinions, the cooperative's management committee used the fact that last year the land of poor peasants increased by 85 jin per mu after joining the cooperative, while the land of middle peasants increased by 40 jin, to illustrate that the potential exploitation of the land of middle and poor peasants was different, and it could not be evaluated solely based on the current actual yield. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to evaluate based on geological conditions, sunshine exposure, water conservancy conditions, and appropriately considering existing basic construction, ensuring that neither middle nor poor peasants suffered losses. The cooperative members were very satisfied. Kongzhai Township in Yangcheng County discovered that some cooperatives had many difficulties in dealing with production materials and immediately researched and sought solutions through the mutual aid and cooperation network. They helped seven cooperatives, including Shangkong and Meile, implement reasonable farm tool rental methods, correcting the phenomenon of dissatisfaction and lack of care for farm tools by middle-peasant cooperative members after farm tools were uniformly priced and entered into the cooperative. A storm occurred in the Nandai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinshui County when dealing with the production materials of cooperative members. At that time, the head of this cooperative wanted to value middle-peasant cooperative member Si Yukun's耕牛 at 500,000 yuan (old currency) to join the cooperative. Si Yukun disagreed and was expelled. All cooperative members experienced mood swings. During this rectification, the entire cooperative held discussions. The leading cadres realized that this violated the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit and made self-criticisms. At the same time, they took the initiative to apologize to Si Yukun and invited him back to the cooperative. Since then, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members has been revitalized.

Currently, more than 12,000 newly established cooperatives in the province have completed review and rectification, and the problems existing in terms of production materials have been addressed.

    山西省农业合作社在处理生产资料工作中
    注意纠正排斥贫农和损伤中农利益的偏向
    【新华社太原十七日电】山西省在整顿巩固两万多个新建的农业生产合作社的时候，普遍注意处理生产资料中排斥贫农和损伤中农利益的偏向。
    壶关县南关劳动农业生产合作社在评议土地产量时，中农社员雷苍则积极主张以当前实产量为依据，但贫农李天锁等因地质好实产量低，主张按土地产量和自然条件来评。社务委员会研究了大家意见后，拿去年贫农入社土地每亩增产八十五斤，中农土地增产四十斤的事实，说明中贫农土地潜在力挖掘程度不同，不能只按当前实产量评议。最后大家一致同意根据地质、阳光背向、水利条件，并适当照顾已有的基本建设来评议，中、贫农互不吃亏，社员们都很满意。阳城县孔寨乡曾发现有些社在处理生产资料上存在许多困难，当即通过互助合作网研究寻找解决办法。帮助上孔、美乐等七个社实行合理的农具租借办法，纠正了农具统一作价入社后，中农社员不满和不爱惜农具的现象。沁水县南大农业生产合作社在处理社员生产资料时曾发生了一场风波。当时这个社的社长要把中农社员司玉坤的耕牛作价五十万元（旧币）入社，司玉坤不同意而被开除。全社社员情绪都有波动。这次在整顿时全社进行了讨论，社领导干部认识了这是违犯自愿互利原则，并作了检讨，同时主动向司玉坤道歉，并请他回社。从此，社员生产情绪又振奋起来。
    现在全省已有一万二千多个新建社完成了审查整顿，处理了在生产资料方面存在的问题。
