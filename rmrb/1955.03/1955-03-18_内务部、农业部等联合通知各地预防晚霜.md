Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The Ministry of Interior of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Central Meteorological Bureau issued a "Joint Notice on Preventing Late Frost Damage" on March 17th.

The notice pointed out: In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year, especially to secure the harvest of wheat and other early-maturing crops and vegetables in areas that suffered severe floods last year, all regions must not only actively organize the masses to do a good job in spring plowing production, but also be highly vigilant against the harm of late frost, widely disseminate effective experiences in preventing frost damage, and mobilize the masses of farmers to take precautions in advance.

The notice introduced some experiences and methods for preventing and rescuing frost damage. The notice stated: Watering and fertilizing before frost can reduce frost damage. All regions can mobilize farmers to make full use of local water sources and fertilizers to strengthen field management of winter-sown crops, and implement topdressing, watering, and hoeing to preserve moisture. Especially in areas that experienced severe floods last year, where winter-sown crops were sown out of season, cultivation was relatively rough, and basal fertilizer was less than in previous years, resulting in poor seedling growth, this aspect of work should be strengthened. Smudging is one of the effective ways to prevent frost. When adopting this method, all regions should pay attention to listening to weather forecast broadcasts and organize elderly farmers to observe climate changes on the spot, and mobilize the masses to fully prepare fuel in advance. As for "pulling frost" on crops with ropes or sweeping frost with brooms, it will only damage the leaves and stems of crops and is harmful rather than beneficial, so it should not be adopted.

The notice emphasized that, in order to prevent and rescue frost damage, all regions must strengthen organizational leadership from top to bottom. Meteorological departments in all regions should pay constant attention to the rapid and accurate forecasting and warning of frost damage, conduct specific research on the local frost patterns, and closely combine scientific knowledge with mass experience. Civil affairs, agriculture, and meteorological departments at all levels should maintain close contact and use communication tools such as telephones, telegrams, and broadcasts to transmit forecasts to rural areas as quickly as possible. During the late frost season, all regions must widely disseminate knowledge and methods of frost prevention to prevent the phenomena of carelessness before frost and panic after the disaster. In seasons and regions prone to frost, temporary organizations for directing frost prevention can be established at the district and township levels when necessary to uniformly lead the prevention and rescue work.

    内务部、农业部等联合通知各地预防晚霜
    据新华社十七日讯：中华人民共和国内务部、农业部和中央气象局三月十七日发出了“关于预防晚霜冻害的联合通知”。
    通知指出：为了争取今年小麦丰收，特别是争取去年曾遭特大洪水地区的小麦和其他早熟作物、蔬菜的收获，各地除积极组织群众做好春耕生产外，必须高度警惕晚霜的危害，并广泛传播防治霜冻的有效经验，发动农民群众预作防范。
    通知中介绍了一些预防和抢救霜冻灾害的经验和办法。通知说：霜前浇水、施肥可减轻冻害，各区可发动农民尽量利用当地的水源和肥料，加强冬播作物的田间管理，实行追肥、浇水、锄苗保墒。特别去年曾发生特大洪水地区，冬播作物播种失时，耕作比较粗糙，基肥较往年减少，幼苗生长不良，更应加强这方面的工作。熏烟是防止霜冻的有效办法之一，各地采用时应注意收听气象预报广播，并组织老年农民实地观察气候变化，事先发动群众充分准备燃料。至于用绳子在农作物上“拉霜”或用扫帚扫霜，只能损害农作物的叶茎，有害无益，不要采用。
    通知强调指出，为预防和抢救霜冻灾害，各地必须加强自上而下的组织领导工作。各地气象工作部门要经常注意霜冻灾害的迅速、准确的预报、警报，并对当地霜冻规律，进行具体研究，并使科学知识和群众经验密切结合起来。各级民政、农业、气象部门应密切联系，利用电话、电报、广播等通讯工具，尽快的将预报传到乡村。现在晚霜季节，各地须广泛传播防霜的知识和办法，以防止霜前麻痹大意和灾后惊慌失措的现象。容易遭霜的季节和地区，必要时可成立区、乡指挥防霜的临时机构，统一领导预防和抢救工作。
