Since the newly built Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant partially commenced production, it has employed various methods to train skilled production personnel. Over the past year, more than a thousand workers have been promoted in grade.

When the plant initially started production in the latter half of 1953, the number of defective products, substandard products, and products requiring rework was substantial, significantly impacting product quality and the completion of production tasks. While strengthening enterprise management, the plant leadership organized amateur technical training classes, enrolling half of the workers for study. They placed greater emphasis on on-the-job learning for workers, organizing specialized technical lectures and technical research meetings focused on specific products. They also encouraged young workers to sign apprenticeship contracts with veteran technical workers, advocating learning while doing. In addition, they actively promoted advanced Soviet experiences. Through this series of activities, the technical level of the vast majority of workers has significantly improved; recently, 89% of workers at grade four and above have been promoted, and 381 apprentices have become technicians.

Since the plant began partial production, it has manufactured and trial-produced more than a hundred types of products. The improvement in the technical level of the broad masses of workers has played a certain role in the completion of these tasks.

    太原重型机器厂技术提高
    新建太原重型机器厂从局部投入生产以后，用各种办法培养熟练生产人员，一年多来已有一千多工人升了级。
    这个厂在一九五三年下半年刚开始生产的时候，废品、次品、退修品数量很多，大大地影响了产品质量和生产任务的完成。厂领导上在加强企业管理的同时，组织了业余技术训练班，吸收半数工人参加学习。他们更注意工人在生产中的学习，组织以产品为对象的专业技术讲座、技术研究会等，并发动青年工人同老技术工人签订师徒合同，提倡边做边学。此外，他们还积极地推广了苏联先进经验。通过这一系列的活动，广大工人的技术水平显著提高；到最近，四级以上工人有百分之八十九都升了级，徒工升为技工的有三百八十一人。
    这个厂从局部生产以来，已经制造和试制了一百多种产品。广大工人的技术水平的提高，对这些任务的完成起了一定的作用。
