    Adjusting Draft Cattle to Support Spring Plowing in Disaster Areas
    In order to solve the difficulty of farmers in the disaster areas last year lacking draft cattle, the Hunan Provincial People's Government, in addition to preparing to purchase more than 10,000 head of draft cattle from Guizhou, Guangxi, and other provinces, also decided to transfer a batch of draft cattle from non-disaster areas in the province to support farmers in disaster areas in spring plowing production. At present, more than 5,000 head of draft cattle have been transferred from non-disaster areas to disaster areas, with farmers in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Hengyang Special District transferring more than 2,000 head. These draft cattle have now begun to be transported to disaster areas. To ensure that the draft cattle are safely transported to disaster areas, supply and marketing cooperatives and relevant units in various non-disaster areas are actively preparing for the feeding and accommodation of the draft cattle, and some places have also set up fodder stations.

    Farmers in non-disaster areas of Jiangxi Province are actively supporting draft cattle in disaster areas, helping farmers in disaster areas to carry out spring plowing production. The Gannan Administrative District and the cattle-producing counties and non-disaster areas of Ji'an and Shangrao Special Districts plan to transfer more than 10,000 head of draft cattle to disaster areas. With the cooperation of supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, and transportation departments, more than 3,000 head of draft cattle have been transferred to the areas along the Yangtze River and around the lakes. Guangfeng County alone has supported the disaster area of ​​Yugan County with more than 1,000 head of draft cattle. Poyang has also established more than a dozen draft cattle trading markets in the county, with cadres from the district and township supply and marketing cooperatives in charge of cattle prices, which greatly facilitates the adjustment of draft cattle between farmers in disaster and non-disaster areas. The county supply and marketing cooperative also sent people to Shangrao, Yushan, Yiyang and other seven counties to purchase 3,000 head of draft cattle, which were sold to disaster victims at the original price. At present, the disaster victims have received more than 2,000 head of draft cattle supported by farmers in non-disaster areas, and are carrying out spring plowing production in full swing.

    调剂耕牛支援灾区春耕
    为了解决去年水灾区农民缺少耕牛的困难，湖南省人民政府除准备去贵州、广西等省采购一万多头耕牛外，还决定在本省非灾区调剂一批耕牛支援灾区农民春耕生产。目前各地非灾区已调剂出五千多头耕牛到灾区，湘西苗族自治州和衡阳专区农民就调剂出两千多头。现在这些耕牛已开始运往灾区。为保证耕牛安全运到灾区，各非灾区供销合作社和有关单位都积极作好耕牛饲、宿等准备工作，有的地方还设立了草料站。（本报湖南记者站）
    江西非灾区农民积极支援灾区耕牛，帮助灾区农民进行春耕生产。赣南行政区和吉安、上饶专区的产牛县份和非灾区，计划调运一万余头耕牛到灾区去，在供销社、银行和交通部门的配合下，目前已调往沿江滨湖地区耕牛三千多头，仅广丰一县就支援余干县灾区耕牛一千多头。鄱阳还在县内设立十几个耕牛交易市场，由区乡供销社干部掌握牛价，大大便利了灾区和非灾区农民进行耕牛调剂。该县供销社还派人分赴上饶、玉山、弋阳等七县购买耕牛三千头，按原价卖给灾民。现灾民已得到非灾区农民支援的耕牛二千多头，正紧张地进行春耕生产。
