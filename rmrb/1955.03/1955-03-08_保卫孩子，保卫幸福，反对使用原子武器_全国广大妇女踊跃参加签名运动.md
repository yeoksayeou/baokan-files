Xinhua News Agency, March 7th:

    Broad masses of women throughout the country are actively participating in the signature campaign against atomic weapons. "Defend children! Defend happiness! Oppose the use of atomic weapons!" has become the unanimous call of women.
    In major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, women have held tens of thousands of signature-collecting rallies. In Shanghai, over two million women enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign. In Tianjin, over 1.2 million women signed, accounting for about half of the total number of signatories in the city. In the southeastern coastal provinces, in small and medium-sized cities, and in the vast rural areas, as well as in remote areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, the signature campaign is also unfolding vigorously.
    During the signature campaign, mothers with many children demonstrated the most resolute will. They all expressed that, for the sake of their children's happiness, mothers will spare no effort to fight for peace. Tang Yanzeng, a mother of thirteen children in Beijing, said excitedly while signing: "Every mother has a responsibility to protect their children, and we cannot tolerate American imperialism burning the flames of war on our children's heads!" A young Mongolian woman, Badamaga Ribu, traveled from a far place to participate in the signature rally. Pointing to her baby, who was less than two months old, she said, "Children are the flowers of humanity, and for us Mongolians, children are even more precious. In order to allow thousands of children to grow up in a peaceful environment, I want to do everything a mother can to defend peace."
    Family members of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who sacrificed their sons and daughters for the motherland, all participated in the signature campaign against atomic weapons with indignant feelings. Ren Liushun, a special model of martyrs' and soldiers' families in Nantong City, said: "My eleven children and I have all lived through the disasters of war. For the sake of peace, two of my children have already sacrificed their lives in the Liberation War, but I will still encourage my children and relatives to continue to contribute everything to defend peace."
    In many areas, women are also enthusiastically working to promote the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. They participate in propaganda activities, conduct family visits, and strive to make the significance of this signature campaign against atomic weapons known to every household.
    While actively participating in the signature campaign, female workers in cities and women in rural areas are taking practical actions to demonstrate their determination to defend peace. More than 3,000 female workers at the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory are working hard to fulfill the pledges they made at the signature rally to increase production and practice economy. After signing, many female members of agricultural production cooperatives have devoted themselves to spring plowing production with soaring labor enthusiasm.

    保卫孩子，保卫幸福，反对使用原子武器
    全国广大妇女踊跃参加签名运动
    据新华社七日讯：全国广大妇女踊跃参加反对原子武器签名运动。“保卫孩子！保卫幸福！反对使用原子武器！”成为妇女们一致的呼声。
    北京、天津、上海等大城市的妇女们举行了成千上万次征集签名的集会。在上海，两百多万妇女满怀热情地参加了签名运动。天津市签名的妇女有一百二十多万人，约占全市签名人数的一半。在东南沿海各省，在中小城市和广大农村中，在少数民族聚居的边远地区，签名运动也都轰轰烈烈地展开。
    在签名运动中，那些多子女的母亲们表现了最坚决的意志。她们都表示，为了孩子们的幸福，做母亲的将不惜一切为争取和平而斗争。北京市一位有十三个子女的母亲唐燕增在签名时激动地说：“每一个母亲都有责任保护她们的孩子，我们不能容忍美帝国主义把战火烧到我们孩子的头上！”一个蒙族青年妇女巴达玛嘎日布，从很远的地方赶去参加签名集会，她指着怀里抱着的不满两个月的孩子说：“孩子是人类的花朵，对于我们蒙古族人，孩子更是可贵，为了让千千万万的孩子能在和平的环境里成长，我要以一个做母亲的所能做到的一切来保卫和平。”
    为祖国献出自己儿女的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属们，都怀着激愤的心情参加反对原子武器签名运动。南通市烈、军属特等模范任刘舜说：“我和我的十一个孩子都是从战争的灾难中度过来的，为了和平，我的两个孩子已在解放战争中牺牲了，但我还要鼓励我的子女和亲人继续为保卫和平而贡献一切力量。”
    许多地区的妇女还热情地为开展反对使用原子武器签名运动而奔走。她们参加宣传活动，进行家庭访问，努力使这次反对原子武器签名运动的意义家喻户晓。
  城市的女工们和农村的妇女们在积极参加签名运动的同时，以实际行动来表示她们保卫和平的决心。天津市第二棉纺织厂的三千多名女工，正在努力实现她们在签名集会上提出的增产节约的保证。许多农业生产合作社的女社员在签名以后，就以高涨的劳动热情投入春耕生产。
