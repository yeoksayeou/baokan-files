    Television
    By Li He, our correspondent in Moscow

    After dinner or on rest days, many cultural and entertainment venues in Moscow open their doors to the public. Some people, for the sake of convenience, prefer to sit in front of a television set at a club or at home and watch their favorite programs.

    Children who are only five or six years old and just beginning to understand things are not yet eligible to enter entertainment venues. The television station also arranges programs for them. Every evening, a fifteen-minute animated film attracts them. There are many interesting stories in the animated films. One particularly vividly drawn tale is the "Golden Deer" fairy tale: Long ago, there lived a deer in the forest. When it stamped its hind hooves, it would produce clusters of gold coins. A greedy king wanted to capture it. One day, the king went hunting and pursued the deer until it was almost cornered. Fortunately, a kind peasant child hid it. The king, after detailed investigation, learned that the child was in contact with the golden deer, so he seized the child, demanding that he summon the golden deer. But all kinds of threats failed to make the child yield. Later, the king found a flute on the child, and played it. The golden deer heard the sound of the flute and appeared, and was immediately captured. It asked to release the child, promising to continuously produce gold coins until the king said he had enough. The king, insatiably greedy, kept shouting "More!" As a result, the golden deer stamped out torrents of gold coins, burying the king and his ministers, who were scrambling for the gold, under a pile of gold coins.

    Children often see new puppet shows, children's plays, and children's films on television, such as the film "The Heroic School," adapted from Gaidar's novel "School," and our Chinese film "Letter with Feather." Muscovites can enjoy newly performed movies, dramas, dance dramas, operas, musical performances, acrobatics, and even sports games on television without leaving their homes. Not long ago, the Soviet and Czechoslovak ice hockey teams competed at the Dynamo Stadium. The players, wearing skates and wielding hockey sticks, swarmed towards the puck, rushing from one end of the rink to the other. The players' fast movements and tense faces were clearly visible on the television screen.

    People who are interested in new things can watch the latest newsreels, feature films, scientific knowledge films, current affairs reports, and commemorative evenings on television in the evening. New creations by high-speed cutting workers and the scenes of wasteland reclamation are all subjects of feature films. At the end of January, a current affairs reporter reported on the situation in Taiwan. He pointed out that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory and condemned the war provocations of the American aggressors.

    Moscow's television programs are diverse. On Sunday, January 30th, there were the following programs: 2:00 PM – The Moscow Young Spectator's Theater's play "It's Better to Negotiate with One's Own People"; 5:00 PM – "Automobile" course; 5:40 PM – Morning exercises instruction; 5:55 PM – Scientific knowledge film on feed nutrition and livestock feeding methods; 7:30 PM – Newsreel; 8:00 PM – The Vakhtangov Theater's play "The Man with a Gun."

    Television occupies an increasingly prominent position in the cultural life of the Soviet people. They compete with radio receivers to serve the people, adding a lot of beautiful content to people's lives. The appearance of a television set is no different from that of a radio, except for a glass panel—a small screen. The larger the screen, the more convenient it is to watch. The screens of newly produced televisions are half the size of a "People's Daily" page. It's not crowded for a dozen people to watch together. The "Hermitage" park in Moscow has a television movie theater with a screen three meters high and four meters wide, which can be watched by hundreds of people at the same time.

    In front of the television, one cannot help but wonder: without film and a projector, how do the characters appear on the screen? Let's open the back and see what's going on. Here, a cathode ray tube lies horizontally, long-necked and wide-bottomed, similar to the light bulbs on a radio receiver. When electricity is applied, electrons fly from the negative electrode at the opening of the tube to the positive electrode at the neck of the tube, striking the bottom of the tube, causing the milky white membrane attached to the bottom of the tube—the screen—to emit light. The electron beam is like a "pencil," drawing lines on the screen. This electronic "pencil" draws six hundred and twenty-five lines in one twenty-fifth of a second at a speed imperceptible to the human eye, so it looks like a film of fine lines. The electromagnetic plate on the waist of the tube is like a wrist, directing the electronic "pencil" to draw up, down, left, and right. The electrode ring inside the opening of the tube is like a nerve, sensing the signals transmitted by the television station via ultra-short waves, causing the electron beam—“pencil”—to draw the true image of the characters on the screen with varying degrees of intensity. The lines drawn by the electron beam of Soviet televisions on the screen are the densest in the world, so the transmission is very clear.

    If you don't go to the television station, it's still difficult to fully imagine how the transmission works. Last year, we visited the Moscow television station. It was the first television station established in the Soviet Union. From a distance, we saw the 150-meter-high television broadcasting tower, like an inverted pointed-bottom multi-layered fishing net hanging from the sky. Inside the television station, there are rooms for actors, makeup, rehearsal, editing, and so on. The most interesting is the studio. The hall and the stands are full of lighting equipment. Lights, microphones, and transmission machines all move with the actors. The appearance of the transmission machine is reminiscent of a camera in a photo studio. The transmission machine also uses electron beams to transmit the scenes captured by the lens to the television station's machine station. In front of the studio, on the viewing platform separated by a glass window, sits the director at the master control desk. On either side of him are assistants and technicians who control the lights and sound. The television station has various machines for adjusting, amplifying, receiving, and sending, as well as machines specifically for transmitting films. The situation being transmitted is displayed on the screens of many cabinet-shaped machines. The television station not only transmits programs performed in its own studio, but also transmits more programs from theaters, clubs, and concert halls.

    Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Kharkov, Kalinin, and other cities all have television stations. Many cities are building new television stations. The programs it transmits can be received in areas within a radius of about 100 kilometers around the television station. Television is becoming more and more popular in the Soviet Union. Last year, the Soviet Union produced 250,000 television sets, and this year it will produce 500,000. This is equivalent to adding hundreds of thousands of small theaters, small cinemas, and small clubs.

    Moscow residents are waiting for natural color television. This will be realized soon. Last year, the radio machinery factory had already manufactured equipment for the Moscow television station that can perform color transmission with its help; it also manufactured color television sets. Machines for exchanging programs between television stations in different cities, especially between Moscow and Leningrad television stations, are also being manufactured.

    Television is a cultural transmission tool of rising prominence. But only in a country like the Soviet Union, with its brilliantly developing socialist culture, does it play a particularly active and beneficial role.

    电视
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    在晚饭后或者休息天，莫斯科许许多多文化娱乐场所向人们敞开大门。有些人图方便，更愿意坐在俱乐部或者家庭自备的电视机面前，选择自己喜欢的节目看。
    五、六岁才懂事的儿童，还没有资格进娱乐场所。电视台也替他们安排有节目。每晚十五分钟的动画片吸引着他们。动画片中有趣的故事很多。有一篇画得很生动的“金鹿”童话：古时候，在森林中住着一只鹿。它的一对后蹄一蹬，就蹬出三三五五的金圆。贪婪的国王想捉它。有一次，国王围猎，追得鹿几乎走头无路。幸亏一位善良的农民小孩把它藏起来。国王经过详细侦察得知这个小孩和金鹿有来往，把小孩抓起来，要他招来金鹿。但是种种威胁，都没有使小孩屈服。后来国王在小孩身上搜出了一只笛子，吹了起来。金鹿听见笛声出现，马上被捉住了。它要求释放小孩，答应不断地蹬出金圆，直到国王说够了为止。国王贪得无厌，不断喊“要”。结果金鹿蹬出一阵又一阵大雨似的金圆，把国王和互相争夺着金圆的臣子们埋葬在金圆堆下。
    儿童们从电视机上时常看到新的木偶戏、儿童剧和儿童影片，如像根据盖达尔的小说“学校”改编的影片“英勇的学校”和我国的电影“鸡毛信”。莫斯科人通过电视机可以足不出户地欣赏新演的电影、话剧、舞剧、歌剧、音乐演奏、杂技以至运动场上的比赛。不久前，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的冰球队在狄纳摩运动场比赛。穿着冰鞋，挥动球棒的队员，拥向冰球，从冰场的一头赶到另一头。队员们的飞快的动作和紧张的脸孔，在电视机上都看得很清楚。
    关心新鲜事物的人们，晚间在电视机上看到最新的新闻片、特写片、科学知识片、时事报告会以及纪念晚会。高速切削工人的新创举，荒地开垦的情景，都有特写片子。一月底，时事报告人报告了台湾情况。他指出台湾是中国不可分割的领土，斥责了美国侵略者的战争挑衅。
    莫斯科的电视节目是多样的。一月三十日这一个星期天有这样一些节目：下午两点—莫斯科少年剧院的话剧“自己人好商量”；五点—“汽车”课程；五点四十分—早操教练；五点五十五分—饲料的养份和饲畜方法的科学知识片；七点半—新闻片；八点—瓦赫坦哥夫剧院的话剧“带枪的人”。
    电视机在苏联人的文化生活中，占据着日益显要的地位。它们同无线电收音机争相为人们服务，给人们的生活添加不少美丽的内容。电视机外表和收音机没有差别，只多一面玻璃板——小银幕。银幕板越大，观看起来越方便。新出产的电视机的银幕板，有“人民日报”半版大。十来人坐在一起观看，并不挤。莫斯科“埃尔美达”公园有个电视电影院，它的银幕高三公尺、宽四公尺，同时可以看几百个人。
    在电视机面前不能不奇怪：它不带影片和放映器，人物怎样会出现在银幕板上呢？打开背面，看个究竟吧。这里平放着一个电子射线管，长颈宽底，类似无线电收音机上的灯泡。通上电流后，电子从管口的阴电极飞向管颈的阳电极，射到管底，使贴着管底的乳白膜板——银幕——发光。电子射线好比一枝“铅笔”，在银幕上画出线条。这枝电子“铅笔”以人眼觉察不出的速度，在二十五分之一秒内画出六百二十五行线条，因此看起来是一片细线条的纹膜。管腰的电磁板，好比手腕，上下左右电子“铅笔”划画的方向。管口内的电极环，好比神经，感受电视台以超短波传送的信号，使电子射线——“铅笔”有轻有重地在银幕板上画出人物真像。苏联电视机的电子射线在银幕板上所画的线条，在世界上是最密的，所以传真非常明晰。
    要是不到电视台，怎样传真还是难以全面想像的。去年我们到莫斯科的电视台去参观过。它是在苏联最先建立的电视台。远远就看见，一百五十公尺高的电视广播铁塔，像一张从天空倒挂下来的尖底的多层的鱼网。电视台内有演员、化妆、排演、编辑等等房室。最有趣的是工作厅。大厅上，看台边，布满灯光装置。灯光、传声筒、传真机都随着演员转动。传真机的样子令人想起照相馆的照相机。传真机也是利用电子射线把摄进镜头的场面，传送到电视台的机器站去。在工作厅正面隔着玻璃窗的看台上，在总电键桌前，坐着导演。他的两旁是助手和操纵灯光和声音的技师。他们在观察和指导表演。电视台有调节、加强、收送的各种机器，有专门传送影片的机器。正在传送的情形，显现在许多柜子形的机器的银幕板上。电视台不单传送自己工作厅内表演的节目，更多地传送各戏院、俱乐部、音乐厅的节目。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、哈尔科夫、加里宁等等城市都有电视台。许多城市在建立新的电视台。在电视台周围半径一百公里左右的地区都收看到它传送的节目。电视在苏联一天天普及起来。去年苏联出产了二十五万架电视机，今年将出产五十万架。这就等于增添几十万个小型剧院、小型电影院、小型俱乐部。
    莫斯科居民都在等着天然彩色的电视。这将很快地实现。无线电机器工厂去年已经为莫斯科电视台制造出一种设备，在它的帮助下可以进行彩色传真；也制造了彩色电视机。不同的城市的电视台之间，首先是莫斯科和列宁格勒电视台之间交流节目的机器，也在制造中。
    电视，是后起之秀的文化传播工具。但只有在苏联这样社会主义文化灿烂发展的国度，它才起着特别活跃的有益的作用。
