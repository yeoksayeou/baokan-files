Electrician Zhang Kejia of the Machinery Repair Plant of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has trial-produced four tools from May 1954 to March 1955: a capacitor blasting machine, an electric fire hardening machine, a magnetizer, and an electric spark grinding wheel. Sixty-seven capacitor blasting machines have now been used in large-scale blasting tunnels and key earthwork and stonework projects. It can detonate from ten to seventy charges at a time, saving a lot of labor compared to manual blasting. Because the capacitor blasting machine has a capacitor bank, it can also avoid misfires and the resulting casualties. The cost of each capacitor blasting machine is less than half that of ordinary electric blasting machines imported from abroad. The Ministry of Railways has recently decided to promote it in construction units across the country to save foreign exchange and increase labor productivity. The electric fire hardening machine can use electricity to plate hard alloys on various tools such as turning tools, milling cutters, and planers, extending the life of ordinary tools by one to fifteen times and greatly shortening the auxiliary production time of the workshop. The electric fire hardening machine can also be used to repair various worn parts.

Zhang Kejia only became an electrician in 1949. In his spare time, he often read translated Soviet science and technology books. The successful trial production of the capacitor blasting machine and other four tools was inspired by relevant Soviet science and technology books. (Xinhua News Agency)

    电工张克嘉试制四种新工具
    铁道部新建铁路第二工程局机械修配厂电工张克嘉，从一九五四年五月到一九五五年三月试制了四种工具——电容式放炮机、电火强化机、充磁机和电花磨轮。在大量爆破隧道、重点土石方等方面，现在已先后使用了六十七台电容式放炮机。它一次可以点十炮到七十炮，比人工点炮可节省大量劳动力。电容式放炮机因为有电容器组，还可以避免瞎炮和由此而发生的伤亡事故。每台电容式放炮机的造价不到由国外输入的普通电引放炮机的一半。最近铁道部已决定在全国各地施工单位中推广，以节省外汇和提高劳动生产率。电火强化机可以用电把硬质合金镀在车刀、铣刀、刨刀等各种刀具上，使普通刀具的寿命延长一倍到十五倍，大大缩短了车间的辅助生产时间。用电火强化机还可以修理各种磨损的机件。
    张克嘉在一九四九年才当电工，他在工作余暇，经常阅读翻译的苏联科学技术书籍。电容式放炮机等四种工具的试制成功，就是他从苏联有关的科学技术书籍中获得启示的。           （新华社）
