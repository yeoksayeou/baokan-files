    Shandong Plans to Plant 200,000 Mu of Walnuts
    Walnuts and Chinese prickly ash are important specialties of the mountainous areas of Shandong Province. In order to increase oil sources, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry plans to use the province's gently sloping, deep-soiled barren hills and vacant land around villages and houses to plant 200,000 mu of walnuts and 1,700 mu of Chinese prickly ash. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry conducted research and deployment at the provincial forestry work conference in February. All counties attach great importance to the planting of woody oil crops. Xintai, Laiwu, Yiyuan, Pingyi, Licheng and other counties have made specific arrangements at the spring forestry representative conferences. At present, all regions are actively preparing. The walnut and Chinese prickly ash seedlings cultivated by various state-owned nurseries are being organized by workers to dig up and supply to the masses for planting. Currently, Jiashang and Laiwu counties alone have planted more than 10,000 walnut trees. In order to prepare seedlings for the large-scale development of woody oil crops in the future, most of the 126 state-owned nurseries in the province have formulated plans to cultivate walnut and Chinese prickly ash seedlings. The Changwei Prefectural Forestry Bureau has prepared more than 160 jin of Chinese prickly ash seeds and allocated them to its affiliated nurseries for seedling cultivation. State-owned Mengshan and Dawa forest farms in the Linyi area are organizing nursery land and cultivating walnut seedlings. (Li Xianzhen)

    山东计划种核桃二十万亩
    核桃、花椒是山东省山区的重要特产。省农林厅为增辟油源，计划利用各地坡度较缓、土层较厚的荒山和村头宅边荒地，栽植核桃二十万亩，花椒一千七百亩。为保证这一计划的实现，省农林厅在二月间全省林业工作会议上进行了研究和部署。各县对栽植木本油料作物都很重视，新泰、莱芜、沂源、平邑、历城等县都在春季林业代表会议上作了具体布置。目前各地正在积极准备，各国营苗圃以前培育的核桃和花椒树苗，正在组织工人掘苗供给群众栽植，现仅嘉祥、莱芜两县即已栽植核桃一万多株。为给今后大量发展木本油料作物准备树苗，全省一百二十六处国营苗圃，大部分都订出了培育核桃和花椒苗的计划，昌潍专署林业局准备了一百六十多斤花椒种，分别调配所属各苗圃进行育苗，临沂专区国营蒙山、大洼等林场正在整理圃地，培育核桃苗。（李宪臻）
