The new Renminbi has been issued since March 1st, and the old Renminbi has been gradually withdrawn. The market has been stable, prices have been stable, and the currency value has been stable in recent days. This fully demonstrates that the issuance of the new Renminbi and the withdrawal of the old Renminbi are in line with the wishes of the people, and also demonstrates the superiority of New China's monetary system.

I.

The new Renminbi is issued on the basis of financial and price stability. This is completely different from the "currency reforms" of capitalist countries based on inflation and unstable prices.

After the First World War, the monetary credit of many capitalist countries was swept away, and they tried to revive monetary credit through "currency reforms." A notable example is Germany's issuance of new marks in exchange for old marks. At that time, Germany had huge reparations after its defeat in the war, with more expenditure than revenue, and the budget could not be balanced. The only way was to issue more banknotes to offset the deficit. Due to reparations, it was necessary to purchase foreign exchange. However, the existing foreign exchange in Germany at that time was not enough to meet the needs of importers, and it could only be purchased at high prices and through private bidding on the market. As a result, foreign exchange soared, and banknotes were issued more frequently. Since there was little foreign exchange, it was necessary to sell marks in markets around the world and absorb gold and silver from various countries. As a result, more marks were issued, and they fell more and more, until they became unmanageable; the more marks issued, the higher the prices rose, the greater the budget expenditure, and the more the income and expenditure could not be offset. The only way was to issue more marks to offset the deficit. After more marks were issued, prices rose even more, and the budget revenue and expenditure became even more unbalanced. There was no end to this vicious cycle, until the mark collapsed.

Let's look at the situation during the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. During the Anti-Japanese War, the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek did not implement a reasonable wartime financial policy, but relied solely on the printing press to issue banknotes indiscriminately, resulting in the poverty and bankruptcy of the people in the entire Kuomintang-controlled area.

The Kuomintang reactionary government's tax revenue mainly came from customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes. Later, income tax was added, but the amount collected was limited. However, the corruption of officials and war expenditure were very high, and all tax revenue was far from enough to meet the needs at that time. Thus, it attempted to issue public bonds to make up for the revenue. However, due to the poor credit of the Kuomintang reactionary government among the people, coupled with the increasing poverty of the people under the long-term exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the purchase of public bonds was not enthusiastic. Most of the public bonds issued during the Anti-Japanese War remained in the "Central Bank" vault, issued but not sold. Thus, it resorted to the printing press and issued banknotes indiscriminately.

The harm of the Kuomintang reactionary government's indiscriminate issuance of banknotes was even greater than the issuance of public bonds because: 1. The public bonds issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government at that time were concentrated in the hands of a few officials and merchants, and the Kuomintang reactionary government and them were one. Public bonds had to be repaid. As for banknotes, they were scattered everywhere, mostly in the hands of the people. The Kuomintang reactionary government had always been irresponsible to the people, and it also intended to make the banknotes non-redeemable, letting them become waste paper. 2. Due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's very low credit among the people, the public bonds issued were not easy to sell, while banknotes could be ordered to be used forcibly and did not need to have sufficient reserves. 3. Public bonds had to pay interest, while banknotes did not pay interest. 4. Due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's poor credit, public bonds were often issued at a discount, such as 10%, 15%, or even 40% or 50% off; but they had to be redeemed at full value. The issuance of banknotes was just the opposite, issued at full value and redeemed at a discount. When Chiang Kai-shek's "legal currency" was withdrawn, it was greatly discounted, causing heavy losses to the people. 5. Public bonds could not be issued immediately when money was needed, while banknotes could be issued at any time.

Chiang Kai-shek's "legal currency" was issued under these considerations. Due to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government's poor credit, the issuance of public bonds could only reach the stage of "issuance" but not the stage of "sale," so it could only use "general subscription vouchers" (a pseudonym for public bonds) as collateral to borrow from the "Central," "China," "Communications," and "Farmers" four banks. These four banks were unable to bear it or had no funds to lend, so they had to use banknotes to垫款. As a result, the issuance of public bonds increased by 10 billion, and the issuance of banknotes—"legal currency"—also increased by 10 billion; the issuance of public bonds increased by 20 billion, and the issuance of banknotes—"legal currency"—also increased by 20 billion. The two always followed closely, and this kind of inflation was called "inflation under the smoke screen," meaning issuing public bonds in name but inflation in reality.

The more Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government issued "legal currency," the more prices soared, without end. The lives of the people, especially the vast number of working people, were the most difficult to maintain, and many became starved corpses. Purchasing power weakened, and production undertakings declined day by day, which produced a series of adverse phenomena: 1. Inflation, 2. "Legal currency" devaluation, 3. Continuous price increases, 4. The bureaucratic capitalist group became richer, 5. The people became poorer, 6. Floating capital flooded, 7. Hoarding and speculation, 8. Prices rose even more, 9. General purchasing power weakened even more, 10. Production undertakings declined even more. In a word, these were all manifestations of the Kuomintang reactionary rule's political crisis and economic crisis, and also the direct evil consequences of indiscriminate issuance of banknotes.

Therefore, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of our country regarded inflation as a deadly poisonous snake. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary ruling group ignored the people's demands and, on the contrary, launched a more frenzied attack on the people, making inflation even more膨胀. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government fantasized about ordering the people to exchange "gold yuan coupons" at a ratio of three million "legal currency" to one; and forced the people to exchange gold for "gold yuan coupons" at the national bank. As a result, the gold, gold bars, and gold ingots of the people in Shanghai and other major cities were all搜刮 by him and fled to Taiwan, while the worthless "gold yuan coupons" remained on the market, causing endless harm. Chiang Kai-shek's "currency reform" was simply an act of robbery.

II.

The decision of the State Council of our country to issue the new Renminbi and withdraw the old Renminbi is fundamentally different in nature from the "currency reforms" of Germany after the First World War and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government.

Due to the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship system, not long after the liberation of the mainland, the national finance was thoroughly unified in a very short period of time, the state budget was balanced, and the road to inflation was blocked from then on. The bank's monetary revenue and expenditure were also balanced. All funds in the warehouses of various organs, troops, schools, factories, cooperatives, etc., except for the retention of scattered expenses, were deposited in the national bank, enabling the national bank to use these deposits to supply the needs of borrowers. In addition, the government also controlled a large number of materials and conducted nationwide adjustments, such as using Sichuan rice to help Shanghai. Therefore, since March 1950, the supply and demand of materials has also been balanced. Foreign exchange revenue and expenditure have also been balanced long ago. With these four balances, namely fiscal revenue and expenditure balance, monetary revenue and expenditure balance, material supply and demand balance, and foreign exchange revenue and expenditure balance, prices across the country have changed very little in the past five years, and the credit of the Renminbi is higher than ever in Chinese history. Today's new Renminbi is based on this basis to exchange the old Renminbi, and the stability of the value of the new Renminbi is beyond doubt.

Some people may ask: "Since prices are stable and the currency value does not change, why is it necessary to exchange?" We all know that the denomination of the old Renminbi is too large and the unit value is too small. People always have an abnormal feeling in their minds, and it is also very inconvenient in terms of writing and calculating, especially in calculating multiplication and division. Today's new Renminbi exchanges one yuan for 10,000 old Renminbi. Two hundred yuan for a fried dough stick is changed to two cents, and seven hundred yuan for an egg is changed to seven cents. This not only eliminates the abnormal feeling in people's minds, but also reduces four circles in writing and calculating, making it more convenient. Internationally, it no longer shows that the unit value of our country's main currency is too small. The old Renminbi only had Chinese characters on the banknotes, and only a few banknotes had Mongolian and Uyghur characters printed on them. The new Renminbi has Chinese, Mongolian, Uyghur, and Tibetan characters printed on it, which is conducive to circulation in fraternal ethnic minority areas. Therefore, the issuance of the new Renminbi has become the demand of the people. The People's Government has also decided to issue the new Renminbi to meet the needs of the people.

Will unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to cause trouble and raise prices during the exchange of new and old Renminbi? I don't think it is very likely. If there is such behavior, the state will severely punish it according to law. Because the conversion ratio of new and old Renminbi is very easy to calculate. A commodity originally sold for 10,000 yuan is now sold for 1 yuan, and originally sold for 200 yuan is now sold for 2 cents. It is difficult for unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of the opportunity to make profits. What is especially important is that most of the materials exchanged between urban and rural areas are now in the hands of state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises. State-owned stores and cooperatives have extremely high prestige in the eyes of the people. If unscrupulous merchants want to take the opportunity to raise prices, they cannot escape the supervision of all parties. Private industrial and commercial operators should understand that obeying state laws is a manifestation of private businesses accepting transformation. Only by honestly accepting transformation can there be a bright future. In the past, many unscrupulous merchants in our country used gold, coins, and foreign currencies for speculation. They spread rumors and made trouble, exchanging paper money for gold and silver coins to drive up prices and lower the currency value. Today, the country's monetary system has been unified, and the gold and silver speculation institutions—the exchanges—no longer exist. This is also a reason to ensure market stability. The market stability and price stability after the issuance of the new Renminbi are sufficient proof.

Some people may ask again: "Does the new currency have gold as collateral?" After the First World War, although the issuance of capitalist countries stipulated that gold should be used as reserves, they have all become non-redeemable, which is equivalent to nothing, and the guarantee function has disappeared. Even in terms of gold guarantees, the ratio of gold reserves and foreign exchange to issuance by the National Bank of China far exceeds the statutory standards of any capitalist country. Our gold reserves in 1954 increased more than tenfold compared to 1950. And our guarantee for banknotes is far more than the gold held by the government, but mainly the large amount of materials controlled by the government. The materials controlled by our government, just taking rice as an example, are considerable in number. Rice is far more meaningful than gold in terms of its role in people's lives. Other daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and cooking oil are all controlled by the government. This is the most important guarantee of the value of the Renminbi. In addition, the government has hundreds of large-scale factories and mines, all of which have great guarantee value.

Judging from the ratio of the amount of currency issued to the state budget and the total value of national production, my country's monetary system is far superior to the current situation in the United States. The current amount of currency issued in the United States is 29.7 billion US dollars, the budget for 1954 to 1955 is more than 63 billion US dollars, and the total value of national production is 360 billion US dollars. This means that the amount of currency issued will account for half of the budget and one-twelfth (ie, more than 8 percent) of the total value of production. Its percentage is so high mainly because the fiscal revenue and expenditure are unbalanced, and it often relies on increasing the issuance to make up for the deficit. The US public debt has originally reached 275 billion US dollars, and it may increase to 282 billion US dollars by the end of last year. When public bonds cannot be sold, they are handed over to the Federal Reserve Bank as collateral, and the bank borrows money to the government for use. As a result, inflation will inevitably be manifested in the monetary aspect. The interest on these public bonds is quite heavy, and this interest burden falls on the people, while the income goes to the capitalists. Our budget is not only balanced in revenue and expenditure, but also has a considerable surplus. Our country's national investment is all allocated from the budget, so there is no need to bear interest. The 6 trillion old Renminbi public debt issued in our country in 1955 only accounts for a very small part of the budget, and the purpose is only to absorb idle funds in the private sector and invest them in expanding production, and a small amount of interest is distributed to savings depositors to encourage the savings of the broad masses of the people. These are all manifestations of the superiority of our country's financial system. It is also a manifestation of the superiority of our country's political and economic system.

III.

The issuance of the new Renminbi shows the further soundness and consolidation of our country's monetary system. However, some people lack sufficient understanding of the characteristics and advantages of New China's monetary system, and do not understand that our country's current monetary system is far superior to the so-called silver standard and exchange standard monetary systems of the past. It is also necessary to talk about these issues.

The so-called silver standard has a prerequisite, that is, its face value must be equal to its actual value. That is, the value of a one-yuan silver coin must be equal to the value of the raw silver contained in the one-yuan silver coin, so that it can exert the function of currency. In this way, changes in foreign silver prices will affect domestic silver prices; changes in domestic silver prices will affect the value of silver coins; changes in the value of silver coins will affect the value of banknotes. As a result, the value of domestic banknotes will change with changes in foreign silver prices.

In 1933, the Kuomintang reactionary government changed to using silver dollars as the standard currency. From then on, the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the United States, controlled the changes in the value of Chinese currency through changes in international silver prices. The United States raised silver prices, and China's silver flowed out one after another, the currency value rose, and prices plummeted, just when the industrial and commercial circles were difficult to maintain, production could not develop, and the economy could not prosper; conversely, if US silver prices fell, foreign silver flowed into China, the currency value fell, prices rose, and the people's lives were difficult to maintain. In short, the power to disrupt finance and manipulate prices was completely manipulated by the United States.

In August 1934, the United States announced the nationalization of silver, raised silver prices, and acquired silver. China's silver began to flow out in large quantities. From July to October 1934 alone, 256 million silver dollars flowed out, which was China's unprecedented silver surplus. Due to the sudden reduction in cash silver, credit contracted, and turnover became increasingly ineffective; due to the rise in silver prices and the fall in prices, coupled with credit tightening and lack of chips, prices fell even more; due to the rise in silver prices, imported goods were cheaper, so more foreign goods were imported, and domestic goods were difficult to export, and the trade deficit increased greatly. It can be seen that the monetary system implemented by the Kuomintang reactionary government, which used silver dollars as the standard, was driving China to become an American colony. In our New China, under the people's democratic dictatorship, we must never allow our country's monetary system to be manipulated by others. Such an era has gone forever, and the silver standard of the Kuomintang reactionary rule era has also gone forever.

In 1935, the Kuomintang reactionary government implemented the pseudo-legal currency system, which was essentially a gold exchange standard monetary system. The gold exchange standard is that the currency of the country relies on setting a fixed ratio with the currency of a foreign country to indicate the value of the currency of the country, and at the same time relies on unlimited buying and selling of foreign exchange to maintain this ratio. The Kuomintang reactionary government implemented the pseudo-legal currency system, and at first wanted to please both the United Kingdom and the United States at the same time, but in the end it completely fell into the arms of the United States and was controlled by the United States. This semi-colonial monetary system is conducive to the capital export of imperialism, conducive to the political and economic control of imperialism over semi-colonial countries, and conducive to the exploitation of imperialism over the people of semi-colonial countries. Our New China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, we must build an independent, unified, prosperous, and strong New China politically, and we must also establish an independent, unified, and stable new monetary system economically. We must never and do not want to see our currency linked to the currency of imperialist countries, rising and falling with it, so that our country loses the right to control finance and our country's prices and markets are manipulated by imperialist countries.

Therefore, the so-called silver standard and exchange standard are all dependent on imperialism. Only our country's current monetary system is independent and autonomous.

Now everyone has seen that the Renminbi has fully exerted the various functions of currency. The value of the Renminbi has increased with the rise of the prestige of the People's Government, the development of production, and the increasing amount of materials controlled by the state. It has firm credit among the people and has become an indispensable currency for all exchanges, disbursements, and revenue and expenditure in our country. Under our country's current monetary system, the issuance of currency is not only guaranteed by materials, but also fully adapted to the development of social production and the expansion of commodity circulation. There is no such thing as inflation or deflation, because our country's monetary system is controlled by the People's Government.

Furthermore, since our country's international balance of payments has reached equilibrium, no one needs to make up for the deficit. Moreover, the scope of trade in the world's peaceful and democratic market is expanding, and trade with other countries is also stable due to the adoption of diverse delivery methods, and the external value of the Renminbi is also very stable.

Therefore, today's Renminbi is a true currency. Because the Renminbi is trusted by everyone; the National Bank issues it according to the needs of society; and because our country's fiscal revenue and expenditure have already reached equilibrium, it will not issue a penny more due to financial difficulties; at the same time, it has the National Bank's strict management; it has a large number of materials in the hands of the state; it has a strong government that is loyal to serving the people as its backing. On such a solid foundation, the credit of the Renminbi will grow day by day and become one of the most perfect and sound currencies in the world.

    新中国货币制度的特点及其优越性
    马寅初
    自三月一日起，新的人民币发行了，旧的人民币已陆续收回。连日来市场稳定，物价稳定，币值稳定。充分说明了发行新的人民币和收回旧的人民币，是符合人民的愿望，并且也表现了新中国货币制度的优越性。
    一
    新的人民币是在金融物价稳定的基础上发行的。这跟资本主义国家在通货膨胀和物价不稳的基础上的“币制改革”，是完全不同的。
    第一次世界大战以后，许多资本主义国家的货币信用扫地，纷纷企图通过“币制改革”来使货币信用起死回生。其中一个显著的例子，就是德国发行新的马克换回旧的马克。当时德国战败以后，赔款很大，支多收少，预算不能平衡，唯有多发纸币来抵补。由于赔款，必须购买外汇。但当时德国已有的外汇，尚不足以应进口商的需要，只有在市场上高价和私人竞买，结果外汇飞涨，纸币也因此多发。外汇既少，势非到各国市场售卖马克，吸收各国金银不可，结果马克又多发，且愈售愈跌，以至不可收拾；马克发行愈多，物价愈涨，预算支出愈大，收支愈不能相抵，唯有再多发行马克以资抵补。马克多发之后物价更涨，预算收支更不能平衡，唯有一再多发。这样因果相循，没有止境，以至于马克崩溃。
    再看蒋介石反动统治时代的情况。在抗日战争时期，蒋介石反动政府不实行合理的战时财政政策，只依靠印刷机，滥发纸币，以致造成整个国民党统治区人民的贫困和破产的局面。
    国民党反动政府的税收，以关税、盐税、统税为主要来源。后来加征所得税，但征到的数目有限。而官吏贪污和战争支出却很多，一切税收远不足以供当时的需要。于是企图发行公债，弥补收入。又由于国民党反动政府在人民群众中的信用不好，加上人民在国民党反动政府长期搜刮下，日益贫穷，所以，购买公债者很不踊跃。抗战时期所发行的公债，大多停留在“中央银行”库中，发而不销。于是就乞灵于印刷机，滥发纸币。
    国民党反动政府滥发纸币的为害，更甚于发行公债。因为：一、当时国民党反动政府发行的公债，集中于少数亦官亦商的人手里，国民党反动政府和他们就是一体，公债非还本不可。至于纸币，则散布四方，大半在人民群众手中，国民党反动政府一贯对人民不负责任，也就存心使纸币不能兑现，任它成为废纸。二、由于国民党反动政府在人民群众中的信用很低，发行的公债不易推销，而纸币可以命令强迫行使，并且无须有充足的准备。三、公债要付利息，纸币不付利息。四、由于国民党反动政府信用不佳，公债往往打扣发行，如九折，八五折，甚至六折、五折；但必须十足收回。发行纸币刚好相反，照十足发出，打折扣收回。蒋介石的“法币”收回时，就打了很大的折扣，使人民遭到很重损失。五、公债在要用钱时不能立刻发出，而纸币可随时发出。
    蒋介石反动政府的“法币”，就是在这种种考虑下发出的。由于蒋介石反动政府信用不好，发行公债，只能做到“发”的地步，不能做到“销”的地步，所以只能以“总预约券”（公债的代名字）作抵向“中央”“中国”“交通”“中农”四家银行借款，这四家银行无力承受，或无款可放，只得用纸币垫款。结果，公债发行增加一百亿，纸币——“法币”增加也一百亿；公债发行增加二百亿，纸币——“法币”发行也增加二百亿。二者总是亦步亦趋，十分密切，这种通货膨胀，称为“烟幕下的通货膨胀”，即发行公债其名，通货膨胀其实。
    蒋介石反动政府的“法币”愈发愈多，物价飞涨，没有止境。人民、尤其是广大劳动人民的生活最难维持，很多成为饿莩。购买力削弱，生产事业日形衰退，这就产生了一连串的不良现象：一、通货膨胀，二、“法币”贬值，三、物价不断上涨，四、官僚资本集团愈富，五、人民愈穷，六、游资充斥，七、囤积居奇，八、物价更上涨，九、一般购买力更削弱，十、生产事业更衰退。一言以蔽之，这都是国民党反动统治的政治危机和经济危机的表现，也是由于滥发纸币的直接恶果。
    所以，我国人民在抗日战争结束后，对于通货膨胀，已视同毒蛇猛兽。蒋介石反动统治集团不顾人民的要求，相反的，向人民进行了更疯狂的进攻，使通货更加膨胀。蒋介石反动政府异想天开，以“法币”按三百万换一的比率，命令人民兑换“金圆券”；并强迫人民以金子向国家银行兑换“金圆券”，结果，上海和其他各大城市人民的金子、金条、金元宝尽被他搜刮而去，逃亡台湾，而不值钱的“金圆券”留在市场上，为害无穷。蒋介石的“币制改革”，简直是强盗行为。
    二
    我国国务院决定发行新的人民币，收回旧的人民币，在性质上根本不同于第一次大战后的德国和蒋介石反动政府的“币制改革”。
    由于人民民主专政制度的优越性，全国大陆解放不久，在很短的期间就把全国财政彻底统一了，国家预算收支平衡，通货膨胀的道路从此阻断了。银行货币收支也做到了平衡，所有各机关、部队、学校、工厂、合作社等库存资金除保留零星用费外，一概存入国家银行，使国家银行有可能利用这些存款供应借款者的需要。此外，政府又掌握了大量物资，进行全国性的调剂，如以川米接济上海。因此，自一九五○年三月以后物资供求也得到平衡了。外汇收支也早已平衡了。有了这四种平衡，即财政收支平衡，货币出纳平衡，物资供求平衡和外汇收支平衡，五年来全国各地物价很少变动，人民币信用之高，是中国历史上所没有的。今天新的人民币就是在这样的基础上来兑换旧的人民币的，新的人民币价值的稳定是毫无疑问的。
    有人可能会问：“物价既然稳定，币值不变，何必要兑换呢？”我们都知道，旧的人民币币面太大而单位价值太小，人们在心理上总有异常的感觉，在写的方面和算的方面也很感不便，计算乘除尤其不便。今天新的人民币以一元换旧的人民币一万元。二百元一根油条改为二分，七百元一个鸡蛋改为七分。这样不但使人民的心理解除异常的感觉，并且，在写算方面少了四个圈，便利更大。在国际上也不再表现我国主币的单位价值太小了。旧的人民币票面上只有汉文，少数票子才印有蒙古文和维吾尔文。新的人民币印有汉、蒙、维、藏文字，有利于在兄弟民族地区流通。因此发行新的人民币就成为人民的要求。人民政府也就决定发行新的人民币来满足人民的要求。
    在新旧人民币兑换过程中会不会有奸商乘机捣乱抬高物价呢？我以为是不大可能的。如果有这种行为，国家就会依法严惩。因为新旧人民币的折合比率很好算，一种商品原卖一万元，现卖一元，原卖二百元现卖二分，奸商取巧图利是很难的。尤其重要的，现在城乡交流的物资，大部分都掌握在国营商业，合作社商业手中，国营商店和合作社在人民心目中均有极高的威信。奸商如要乘机抬高物价，是逃不掉各方面的监督的。私营工商业者都应该明白：服从国家的法令，正是私商接受改造的表现。只有老老实实接受改造，才会有光明的前途。从前我国很多奸商以黄金、硬币和外币作投机，他们造谣捣乱，以纸币换取金银硬币掀抬物价，压低币值，今天国家的币制已经统一了，金银投机机构——交易所已不存在，这也是保证市场平稳的一个原因。新的人民币发行以后，市场稳定，物价稳定，就是充分的证明。
    有人又要问：“新的货币有没有黄金做保证金呢？”第一次世界大战以后，资本主义国家的发行虽然规定黄金作准备，但都已不兑现，有等于无，保证的作用消失。即使拿黄金保证来说，我国国家银行保有的黄金量和外汇对发行的比例也远远超过任何资本主义国家的法定标准。我们一九五四年的黄金量比一九五○年增加了十倍以上。而我们给纸币的保证远不止政府保有的黄金，而主要的是政府掌握了的大量物资。我们政府掌握的物资，单拿米一项来说，为数已可观。米对人民生活的作用来说远比黄金有意义。其他如棉纱、棉布、食油等民用必需品都是掌握在政府手里。这是人民币价值的最重要的保证。此外政府又有数百个大规模的工厂和矿井，都具有极大的保证价值。
    就货币发行额对国家预算和国家生产总值的比率来看，我国货币制度远比美国的现状优越。美国现在发行额为二百九十七亿美元，一九五四年到一九五五年度预算为六百三十余亿美元，国家生产总值为三千六百亿美元。这就是说发行额将占预算的一半，占生产总值的十二分之一（即百分之八多一点）。它的百分比，所以这样高，主要是由于财政收支不平衡，往往靠增加发行来弥补。美国公债原已达二千七百五十亿美元，去年年底可能增到二千八百二十亿美元，公债销不出去时，则交给联合准备银行作抵押，由银行借款给政府来支用，结果必然在货币方面表现膨胀。这些公债的利息相当重，这些利息负担却落在人民身上，而收入则归了资本家。我们的预算，不但收支平衡，而且有相当的剩余。我国国家投资均由预算拨出，所以不必负担利息。我国一九五五年发行的旧人民币六万亿元公债在预算中只占很小一部分，目的仅在吸收民间闲散着的资金，而使之投于扩大生产之用，而少数利息分散给储蓄存款户，借以鼓励广大群众的储蓄。这些都是我国金融制度的优越性的表现。也是我国政治经济制度的优越性的表现。
    三
　　新人民币的发行，说明了我国货币制度的进一步健全和巩固。但有些人对新中国货币制度的特点及其优越性还缺乏足够的认识，还不了解我国现行货币制度远较过去所谓银本位、汇兑本位的货币制度为优越。对于这些问题，也有必要来谈一下。
    所谓银本位，它有一个前提，就是它的面值必须和它的实值相等。就是一元银币的价值和一元银币所含生银的价值须相等，如此它方能发挥货币的功用。这样，国外银价涨落的变化，就会影响到国内的银价；国内银价涨落的变化，就会影响到银币价值；银币价值涨落的变化就会影响到纸币价值。结果，就使国内纸币价值随着国外银价涨落而变化。
    一九三三年，国民党反动政府改以银元为本位币。英美两国，尤其是美国，从此就通过国际银价的变化，支配了中国币值的变化。美国抬高银价，中国的白银就纷纷外流，币值上升，物价骤跌，正当工商界就难以维持，生产无法发展，经济无法繁荣；反之，美国银价下跌，国外的白银纷纷流入中国，币值下降，物价上升，人民的生活难以维持。总之，扰乱金融，操纵物价之权完全操纵在美国。
  一九三四年八月，美国宣布了白银国有，提高银价，收购白银，中国白银就开始大量外流，仅一九三四年七月到十月为止，流出了二亿五千六百万银元，为我国空前的白银出超额，国内金融因现银骤减，信用收缩，周转愈觉不灵；由于银价上涨，物价下跌，加以信用紧缩，筹码缺乏，物价更跌；国内因银价上涨，进口货便宜，所以外货进口较多，本国货外销困难，入超大大增加了。可见国民党反动政府实行的以银元为本位的货币制度，正驱使中国沦为美国殖民地。在我们新中国，在人民民主专政之下，我们决不能使我国货币制度任别人操纵，这样的时代已一去不复返了，国民党反动统治时代的银本位也已一去不复返了。
    一九三五年国民党反动政府实行伪法币制度，实质上即是金汇兑本位的货币制度。金汇兑本位，是本国的货币依靠与外国货币订定固定的比率来标明本国货币的价值，同时依靠无限制买卖外汇来维持这种比率。国民党反动政府实行伪法币制度，开始还想对英美两国同时讨好，而最后便完全落入美国的怀抱，受美国的控制。这种半殖民地性质的货币制度，有利于帝国主义的资本输出，有利于帝国主义对半殖民地国家政治上、经济上的控制，有利于帝国主义对半殖民地国家人民的剥削。我们新中国，在中国共产党和人民政府领导之下，我们在政治上要建立一个独立的统一的和繁荣富强的新中国，在经济上也要建立独立的统一的和稳定的新币制，决不能也不愿眼见我们的货币和帝国主义国家货币联系在一块儿，随它涨落，使我国失去金融上的控制权利，使我国物价和市场受帝国主义国家操纵。
    所以，所谓银本位和汇兑本位都是依赖帝国主义的。惟有我国现行的货币制度是独立的自主的。
    现在大家都已看到，人民币已充分发挥了货币的各种机能。人民币的价值随着人民政府威信的高涨、生产的发展、国家掌握的物资也日益增多，在人民群众中已具有坚定的信用，已成为我国一切交换、出纳、收支等所不可缺少的货币了。在我国现行货币制度之下，货币的发行不但有物资保证，并且完全适应于社会生产的发展和商品流通的扩大，无所谓通货膨胀和通货紧缩，这是因为我国的货币制度为人民政府所掌握着的。
    再者，由于我国国际收支已达到平衡，无人超需要弥补，并且，世界和平民主的市场贸易范围日益扩大，对其他国家的贸易也由于采取了多样的交货方式，人民币的对外价值也很稳定。
    所以，今日的人民币是真正的货币。由于人民币人人信任；国家银行根据社会的需要发行；又因我国财政收支早已达到平衡，也不至因财政困难而多发一文；同时有国家银行严密的管理；有大量物资掌握在国家手中，有忠诚为人民服务的强有力的政府为后盾，在这样巩固的基础上，人民币信用将日益增长，成为世界上最完美最健全的货币之一。
