Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th (TASS dispatch): The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the Austrian Treaty issue. The full text is as follows:

Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov held two more meetings on March 14th and March 24th with the Austrian Republic's ambassador to Moscow, N. Bischoff, regarding the issue of concluding the Austrian State Treaty.

In the meeting on March 14th, Austrian Ambassador N. Bischoff gave Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov the Austrian government's reply to the Soviet government's suggestions of February 8th of this year on the Austrian issue. The full text is as follows:

“The Federal Government notes with deep satisfaction that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to resolving the Austrian issue and restoring the complete independence of democratic Austria in accordance with the interests of maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe. It notes with satisfaction that the Soviet Union believes that any further delay in concluding the Austrian State Treaty is unjustified.

Regarding point 1

The Federal Government welcomes any effective safeguards and guarantees for Austria's independence and freedom, to prevent aggression from any side, and thus also prevent the danger of an Anschluss.

Regarding point 2

The Federal Government has repeatedly and very clearly stated that Austria does not intend to join military alliances, nor does it intend to allow the establishment of military bases on its territory. The Federal Government is prepared to exchange views to discuss in what way, under certain conditions, to make such a declaration again.

Regarding point 3

The Federal Government also believes that a conference of all concerned countries with Austrian participation can achieve a final resolution of the Austrian issue. However, the Federal Government believes that the issues mentioned in points 1 and 2 should be clarified beforehand as necessary, in order to allow such a conference to have the prospect of reaching concrete results quickly.

The Federal Government believes that separate discussions on the Austrian State Treaty by the Four Powers with Austria's participation would lead to the smooth conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty."

To this end, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received Austrian Ambassador Mr. Bischoff on March 24th, and gave him the Soviet government's reply to the Austrian government's aforementioned statement. The full text of the reply is as follows:

“After studying the Austrian government's reply of March 14th, the Soviet government notes with satisfaction that the Austrian government agrees with the Soviet government's view that the resolution of the Austrian issue, the resolution of restoring the complete independence of democratic Austria, should be in accordance with the interests of maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe.

In order to satisfy the wishes of the Austrian government, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to give further explanations on the issues mentioned in the Austrian government's reply.

Regarding point 1

The Soviet government notes the Austrian government's statement that it welcomes any effective safeguards and guarantees for Austria's independence and freedom, to prevent the danger of Anschluss or aggression from any side.

From this, it is clear that practical measures must be taken, taking into account the existing West German re-militarization plans, because such plans increase the danger of Austria being annexed (Anschluss).

Therefore, the issue of the withdrawal period of the four countries' troops from Austrian territory must be considered, and what measures should be taken in the future in the event of a direct threat of Anschluss should be considered.

Regarding point 2

The Austrian government's statement states that Austria does not intend to join military alliances, nor does it intend to allow the establishment of military bases on its territory. The Soviet government believes that this statement indicates that the Austrian government agrees with the Soviet government's second point of the suggestions on this issue on February 8th of this year.

The Soviet government is prepared, in accordance with the wishes of the Austrian government, to discuss the issue of what way the Austrian government can issue a corresponding statement on this point.

The Soviet government reiterates the need for the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to assume corresponding obligations.

Regarding point 3

In order to satisfy the wishes of the Austrian government, the Soviet government agrees to discuss the Austrian State Treaty issue separately at a conference of the four countries and with Austria's participation.

	Moscow, March 24, 1955"

In addition, V.M. Molotov also made the following oral statement to Mr. Bischoff:

"The Soviet government knows from the statement issued by Austrian Chancellor Raab that he has expressed a positive attitude towards the possibility of his coming to Moscow to discuss issues related to the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty.

In view of Mr. Raab's aforementioned statement, and considering that personal contact between the leaders of the Soviet Union and Austria is appropriate, the Soviet government would welcome Premier Raab and other Austrian representatives whom the Austrian government deems appropriate to send to Moscow for this purpose in the near future."

Ambassador Bischoff promised to inform the Austrian government of this matter immediately.

### 苏联外交部　就对奥和约问题发表声明

    苏联外交部
  　就对奥和约问题发表声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：苏联外交部就对奥和约问题发表声明。全文如下：
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫在三月十四日和三月二十四日再度同奥地利共和国驻莫斯科大使纳·比萧夫，就缔结对奥和约问题举行了两次会谈。
    在三月十四日的会谈中，奥地利大使纳·比萧夫把奥地利政府对苏联政府在今年二月八日就奥地利问题的建议的复文交给了苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫，全文如下：
    “联邦政府深为满意地注意到，苏联十分重视依照维护和巩固欧洲和平的利益，解决奥地利问题，解决恢复民主奥地利的完全独立的问题。它满意地注意到，苏联认为缔结对奥和约的任何进一步拖延都是没有理由的。
    关于第一点
    联邦政府欢迎对奥地利的独立和自由的任何有效的保障和保证，以防止任何方面的侵犯，因而也防止德奥合并的危险。
    关于第二点
    联邦政府曾一再十分明确地声明，奥地利不打算参加军事联盟，也不打算允许在它的领土上建立军事基地。联邦政府准备交换意见，商讨以怎样一种方式在一定条件之下再次作出声明。
    关于第三点
    联邦政府还相信，所有有关国家举行一次有奥地利参加的会议是能够求得奥地利问题的最后解决的。但是联邦政府认为，应该对第一点和第二点中所提到的问题事先作必要的澄清，以便使这种会议有迅速达成具体结果的前景。
    联邦政府认为，在奥地利参加下由四大国单独讨论对奥和约会导致顺利缔结对奥和约。”
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫为此在三月二十四日接见了奥地利大使比萧夫先生，并且把苏联政府对奥地利政府的上述声明的答复交给他。答复全文如下：
    “研究奥地利政府三月十四日的答复之后，苏联政府满意地注意到：奥地利政府同意苏联政府的意见，即奥地利问题的解决、恢复民主奥地利的完全独立的问题的解决应该符合于维持和巩固欧洲和平的利益。
    为了满足奥地利政府的愿望，苏联政府认为必须就奥地利政府的答复中所谈到的问题给予进一步的解释。
    关于第一点
    苏联政府注意到奥地利政府这个声明，即它欢迎对奥地利的独立和自由的任何有效的保障和保证，以防止德奥合并的危险或任何方面的侵犯。
    由此可见，必须考虑到现有的西德重新军国主义化计划而采取切实的措施，因为这种计划使奥地利被并吞（德奥合并）的危险增加了。
    因此，必须考虑四国从奥地利领土撤兵的期限问题，并且应该考虑将来一旦发生德奥合并的直接威胁时应该采取怎样的措施。
    关于第二点
    奥地利政府的声明说，奥地利不打算参加军事联盟，也不打算允许在它的领土上建立军事基地。苏联政府认为，这个声明表明奥地利政府同意苏联政府今年二月八日关于这个问题的建议的第二点。
    苏联政府准备按照奥地利政府的愿望，讨论奥地利政府可以用什么方式就这点发表一个相应的声明的问题。
    苏联政府重申，美国、英国、法国和苏联方面有必要承担相应的义务。
    关于第三点
    为了满足奥地利政府的愿望，苏联政府同意在四国和有奥地利参加的会议上单独地讨论对奥和约问题。
          一九五五年三月二十四日于莫斯科”
    此外，维·米·莫洛托夫还向比萧夫先生作了如下的口头声明：
    “苏联政府从奥地利总理拉布先生发表的声明中知道了他对他前来莫斯科商讨同缔结对奥和约有关的问题的可能性表示了积极的态度。
    鉴于拉布先生上述的声明，并且考虑到苏奥两国领导人物亲自接触是适宜的，苏联政府将欢迎拉布总理以及奥地利政府认为适宜于为此目的派往莫斯科的其他奥地利代表在不久将来前来莫斯科。”
    比萧夫大使答应立即将这件事通知奥地利政府。
