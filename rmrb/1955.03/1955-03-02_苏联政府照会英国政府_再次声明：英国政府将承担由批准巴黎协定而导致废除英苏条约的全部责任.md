Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 1st: According to newspapers, the Soviet government sent a note to the British government on December 20, 1954. The note pointed out that the British government's actions in signing the Paris Agreements contradicted the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the War against Hitlerite Germany and on Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter of 1942.

In its reply of January 26th of this year, the British government expressed its disagreement with the aforementioned note from the Soviet government, attempted to justify its actions, and declared that it intended to continue along the path it had chosen.

Therefore, on February 28th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note from the Soviet government to the British Embassy in Moscow. The content of the note is as follows:

	"In view of the British government's note of January 26, 1955, the Soviet government deems it necessary to state the following:
   	In the note of December 20, 1954, the Soviet government called the British government's attention to the fact that the British government's actions, as manifested in the conclusion of the so-called Paris Agreements which stipulate the remilitarization of West Germany and the incorporation of West Germany into a military bloc aimed at the Soviet Union, are in fundamental contradiction with the obligations of post-war cooperation and mutual assistance undertaken by Great Britain under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of May 26, 1942. The note also pointed out that the act of ratifying the Paris Agreements would mean Great Britain's abrogation of the aforementioned Anglo-Soviet Treaty.
    In its reply, the British government stated that Great Britain's participation in the Paris Agreements did not violate its obligations under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, and that the alliance of certain countries being established in Western Europe, with the participation of a remilitarized West Germany and clearly aimed at certain peace-loving countries, would promote peace and European security.
    At the same time, the British government insisted that it was not responsible for the division of Germany and the fact that it has not been possible to find a basis for cooperation with the Soviet government so far.
    The Soviet government cannot agree with this statement by the British government.
    It is an undeniable fact that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty was concluded at a time when the Soviet Union and Great Britain, together with other countries of the anti-Hitler alliance, were waging a difficult struggle against the common enemy, Hitler's Germany, and when the war seriously threatened both countries. Furthermore, by concluding this treaty, the Soviet Union and Great Britain undertook the obligation to cooperate in organizing European security after the restoration of peace and to take all measures to make it impossible for Germany to commit aggression and disrupt peace again. The two contracting parties also guaranteed not to conclude any alliance against the other party and not to participate in any group against the other party.
    However, the facts show that after the end of the war, the British government embarked on a path that violated the obligations it had undertaken under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.
    It refused to cooperate with the Soviet government in restoring Germany's unity in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles, but instead, together with the United States and France, pursued a policy of unilateral action on the German question, dividing Germany into eastern and western parts.
    The British government, pursuing this policy of dividing Germany, together with the United States government and the French government, began direct preparations for the remilitarization of West Germany and its incorporation into a military bloc aimed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe. This policy is manifested in the signing of the Paris Agreements on October 23, 1954; the Paris Agreements stipulate the establishment of a West German army commanded by Hitlerite generals and officers, and the supply of this army with all kinds of weapons, including atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons. It is extremely obvious that arming the revanchists of Germany and drawing them into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc and the newly established Western European military alliance will serve the preparation for a new war rather than the consolidation of peace.
    The attempt to justify the act of incorporating the remilitarized West Germany into these two military alliances by insisting that the North Atlantic bloc and the newly established Western European military alliance are of a so-called defensive nature is obviously bankrupt. This can already be seen from the fact that all Soviet proposals for the establishment of a European collective security system with the participation of all relevant European countries have been invariably rejected by the British government. The British government even evaded discussing these proposals.
    However, in reality, such a policy of establishing military blocs in Europe with the participation of a remilitarized West Germany under the guise of the union of so-called "like-minded" countries is to increase the danger of peace being disrupted and to lead to a new war in Europe, no matter how this is concealed now.
    Since the British government is one of the main organizers and members of the Paris Agreements, it is pursuing a dangerous policy of reviving German militarism, which provoked a world war not long ago, and is dragging a remilitarized West Germany into an aggressive military alliance. This policy, which creates the danger of a new war, is in complete contradiction with the purpose of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. This is precisely what the Soviet government called to the British government's attention in its note of December 20, 1954. The Soviet note stated that the Paris Agreements, which can only be enthusiastically implemented by the aggressors of certain countries who are preparing for a new war, are incompatible with the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.
    Despite this, the British government, completely disregarding the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, continues to strive to bring the Paris Agreements into effect as soon as possible, which can only prove that the British government today does not consider itself concerned with maintaining this treaty.
    In view of the above, the Soviet government fully affirms the position stated in its note of December 20th, and once again deems it necessary to state that the act of ratifying the Paris Agreements will lead to the abrogation of the Treaty of Alliance in the War against Hitlerite Germany and on Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter, concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on May 26, 1942.
    Also, due to the above, the British government will bear full responsibility for the abrogation of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.
        Moscow, February 28, 1955."

### 苏联政府照会英国政府  再次声明：英国政府将承担由批准巴黎协定而导致废除英苏条约的全部责任

    苏联政府照会英国政府
    再次声明：英国政府将承担由批准巴黎协定而导致废除英苏条约的全部责任
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：据报纸报道，苏联政府曾在一九五四年十二月二十日向英国政府送交照会一份。照会指出，英国政府在签订巴黎协定方面的各种行动，是同一九四二年的英苏战后合作互助同盟条约抵触的。
    英国政府在今年一月二十六日的复照中，对于苏联政府的上述照会表示不同意，力图替自己的行动辩解，并声称它打算沿着它已经选择的道路走下去。
    因此，苏联外交部在二月二十八日向英国驻莫斯科大使馆送交苏联政府的照会一份。照会内容如下：
      “鉴于英国政府一九五五年一月二十六日的照会，苏联政府认为有必要声明如下：
   苏联政府在一九五四年十二月二十日的照会中，提请英国政府注意下面的事实：表现在缔结规定西德重新军国主义化并把西德并入矛头指向苏联的军事集团的所谓巴黎协定上面的英国政府的行动，是同英国根据一九四二年五月二十六日的英苏条约所承担的战后合作互助的义务根本抵触的。照会还指出，批准巴黎协定的行动，将意味着英国废除上述的英苏条约。
    英国政府在复照中说什么英国参加巴黎协定并不违反它在英苏条约中承担的义务，说什么正在西欧建立的、有重新军国主义化的西德参加的、矛头显然指向某些爱好和平的国家的某些国家的联盟将促进和平和欧洲安全。
    同时，英国政府硬说，对于德国的分裂和迄今一直没有可能找到同苏联政府进行合作的基础的事实，英国政府是不负责任的。
    苏联政府无法同意英国政府的这种说法。
    英苏条约的缔结是在苏联和英国，同反希特勒联盟的其他国家一道，正在对共同的敌人希特勒德国进行着困难的斗争的时候，是在战争严重地威胁着两国的时候，这是一件确凿的事实。此外，苏联和英国缔结这一条约，就承担了在和平重建以后为了组织欧洲的安全而进行合作并且采取一切措施来使德国不可能再肆侵略和破坏和平的义务。缔约国双方并保证决不缔结反对他方的任何同盟并且不参加反对他方的任何集团。
    可是，事实表明，在战争结束后，英国政府走上了违反它根据英苏条约所承担的义务的道路。
    它拒绝同苏联政府合作来按照和平和民主的方针恢复德国的统一，却转而同美国和法国一起，奉行了在德国问题上采取片面行动的政策，使德国分裂成东西两部分。
    奉行这种分裂德国的政策的英国政府，同美国政府和法国政府一起，开始了使西德重新军国主义化并把它并入矛头指向苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的国家的军事集团中去的直接准备工作。表现在一九五四年十月二十三日巴黎协定的签订上的就是这一政策；巴黎协定规定要建立一支由希特勒将领和军官指挥的西德军队，并要以包括原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器在内的各式各样武器，供给这支军队。极其明显，武装德国的复仇主义分子并把他们拉进侵略性的北大西洋集团和新建立的西欧军事联盟的做法将服务于准备一次新战争而不是服务于巩固和平。
    硬说北大西洋集团和新建立的西欧军事联盟具有所谓防御性质借以为把正在重新军国主义化的西德并入这两个军事联盟的行动辩解，这种企图显然是破产了的。这已经可以从以下的事实中看出：苏联关于在一切有关的欧洲国家参加下建立一个欧洲集体安全体系的一切建议，都遭到英国政府一成不变地拒绝。英国政府甚至规避讨论这些建议。
    然而，实际上，这样一种在所谓“志同道合的”国家的联合的掩饰下在欧洲建立有重新军国主义化的西德参加的军事集团的政策，是要增加使和平遭受破坏的危险并且导致欧洲新战争的，不论现在怎样掩饰这一点。
    英国政府既然是巴黎协定的主要组织者和成员之一，就是在奉行复活不久以前挑起一次世界大战的德国军国主义的危险政策，就是在把重新军国主义化的西德拉入侵略性军事联盟。这种政策产生新战争的危险，是同英苏条约签订的目的完全抵触的。苏联政府在一九五四年十二月二十日的照会中提请英国政府注意的正是这种情况。苏联照会说：只有正在准备新战争的某些国家的侵略分子才热中于执行的巴黎协定是同英苏条约不相容的。
    尽管这样，英国政府完全不顾英苏条约，还是继续努力要使巴黎协定尽早生效，这只能证明今天英国政府并不认为自己是关心维护这个条约的。
    由于上述情况，苏联政府充分肯定它在十二月二十日照会中所申述的立场，再一次认为有必要说明：批准巴黎协定的行动将导致废除苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国间所缔结的、于一九四二年五月二十六日签订的战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲盟国与战后合作互助条约。
    也是由于上述情况，废除英苏条约的全部责任将由英国政府承担。
        莫斯科，一九五五年二月二十八日。”
