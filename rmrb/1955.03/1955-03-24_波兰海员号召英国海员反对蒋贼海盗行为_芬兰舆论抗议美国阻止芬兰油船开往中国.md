Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 23rd: According to Polish newspapers, the entire crew of the Polish merchant ship "Jarosław Dąbrowski" wrote to the British Seamen's Union on March 21, calling for joint action to oppose the piracy of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and defend freedom of navigation and the rights of seafarers.

The letter stated that our Polish merchant ships "Praca" and "President Gottwald" were robbed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, instigated and sheltered by US imperialism. The crew of the "President Gottwald" are still being detained by the Chiang bandits and cannot return to their homeland and reunite with their families. In addition to Polish merchant ships, merchant ships from Britain and other countries have also suffered from these pirate attacks. The recent sinking of the British merchant ship "Prosperity" is an example. This piracy seriously threatens the safe navigation of merchant ships of all countries and the safety of seafarers' professions and lives.

The letter said, we hope that you can join us in taking joint action to oppose illegal piracy and protect the safety of our seafarers' professions and lives. We hope you will support our just call for the release of Polish merchant ships and seafarers.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 23rd: Helsinki News: The US obstruction of the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba" from sailing to China has aroused indignation and opposition in Finnish public opinion.

"People's Labor" published editorials on the 8th and 16th, condemning the US for exerting pressure on Finland. The editorial pointed out: The United States has consistently wanted to force Finland to sever trade relations with the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and European people's democracies. "In the Aruba oil tanker incident, the US government once again exposed to the world their crimes of aggression against the People's Republic of China, piracy, and opposition to the legitimate rights and free trade of all countries."

The "New Era" editorial on the 17th also criticized the United States for opposing Finnish shipping and trade relations between Finland and the People's Republic of China through terrorist acts.

The "Free Speech" editorial on the 17th pointed out that the United States openly threatens the "Aruba" with piracy, which is a threat to the continuation and development of Finnish trade with China, amounting to billions of marks.

International affairs commentator Svanto commented in the "Finnish Social Democratic Party Newspaper" on the 19th, based on international law, saying that the only applicable principle is that the voyage of the "Aruba" must not be obstructed. He said that the act of blocking the "Aruba" is best named "piracy."

    波兰海员号召英国海员反对蒋贼海盗行为
    芬兰舆论抗议美国阻止芬兰油船开往中国
    【新华社华沙二十三日电】据波兰报纸刊载，波兰商船“雅罗斯瓦夫·董布罗夫斯基号”的全体船员在三月二十一日写信给英国的海员工会，号召共同行动来反对蒋介石卖国集团的海盗行为，保卫航海自由和海员权利。
    信中说，我们波兰商船“工作号”和“哥特瓦尔德总统号”都被由美帝国主义唆使和庇护的海盗蒋介石匪帮抢劫去了。而“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的船员们至今仍被蒋匪帮扣留着，不能返回自己的祖国和亲人团聚。遭受这些海盗侵害的除波兰商船外，还有英国和其他各国的商船。最近，英国商船“正伟健号”的被炸沉就是一个例子。这种海盗行为严重地威胁着各国商船的安全航行和海员的职业和生命的安全。
    信中说，我们希望你们能同我们一起为反对非法的海盗行为和保卫我们海员的职业和生命安全而共同行动。希望你们支持我们要求释放波兰商船和海员的正义呼声。
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】赫尔辛基消息：美国阻挠芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”开往中国的行为引起了芬兰舆论的愤激和反对。
    “劳动人民报”在八日、十六日先后发表社论，谴责美国对芬兰施加压力。社论指出：美国一贯想压迫芬兰断绝同中华人民共和国、苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的贸易关系。“在阿鲁巴号油船事件上，美国政府再一次在全世界面前暴露了他们侵略中华人民共和国、进行海盗行为、反对世界各国的合法权利和自由贸易的罪恶。”
      “新时报”十七日社论也斥责美国用恐怖行为反对芬兰的船运，反对芬兰同中华人民共和国的贸易关系。
    “自由谈报”十七日社论指出：美国公开以海盗行为威胁“阿鲁巴号”，就是威胁芬兰同中国之间数达数十亿马克的贸易的继续和发展。
    国际问题评论家斯万托十九日在“芬兰社会民主党报”上根据国际法发表评论说：唯一适用的原则是不得阻拦“阿鲁巴号”的航行。他说拦阻“阿鲁巴号”的行为最好以“海盗”二字命名。
