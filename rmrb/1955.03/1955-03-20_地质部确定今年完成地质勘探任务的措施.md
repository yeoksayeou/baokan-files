Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The Ministry of Geology convened the 1955 Geological Conference from February 22nd to March 17th, and determined important measures to complete the geological exploration tasks for 1955.

The conference believed that 1955 is a decisive year for completing the Five-Year Plan. This year, the Ministry of Geology will conduct large-scale prospecting work to find new production areas for petroleum, iron, coal, and other mineral resources. It will also accelerate the exploration of existing mineral deposits to provide sufficient mineral resources to meet the growing needs of national economic construction. To this end, the total workload of geological exploration this year has greatly increased compared to 1954, with the amount of drilling work alone increasing by more than 147,000 meters. At the same time, the cost of geological exploration must also be greatly reduced to save the state's funds.

The conference determined that the main measures for completing the geological exploration tasks in 1955 are: (1) Strengthening scientific research work. Compiling and studying national mineral distribution maps, geological research degree maps, and mineral prediction maps to provide direction for large-scale geological prospecting work; further studying prospected and explored mineral deposits, summarizing experience, and improving the theoretical and technical level of geological exploration work; strengthening experimental research work, and improving the technical level of rock and mineral identification, chemical analysis, and processing experiments. (2) Improving the quality of exploration design to make it more practical; at the same time, implementing the design principle of achieving maximum results with the most economical workload, and overcoming the wasteful thinking of only focusing on completing tasks without considering costs. (3) Strengthening the management of geological exploration work, formulating and implementing various norms and technical standards for geological work, establishing a responsibility system, and promoting quota management and work plans to ensure work quality, save funds, and improve labor productivity. (4) Comprehensively learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts in a guided, organized, and systematic manner. (5) Strengthening political and ideological work, improving the political and ideological level and work enthusiasm of the vast number of employees, and better completing the arduous geological exploration tasks of 1955.

Attendees also listened to some specialized reports made by Soviet experts and Chinese geological workers.

    地质部确定今年完成地质勘探任务的措施
    【新华社十九日讯】地质部在二月二十二日到三月十七日召开了一九五五年地质会议，确定了一九五五年完成地质勘探任务的重要措施。
    会议认为：一九五五年是完成五年计划有决定意义的一年。地质部今年要进行大规模的普查工作，为石油、铁、煤和其他各种矿物资源找到新的产地，还要加速勘探已有的矿产地，提供足够的矿产资源，满足国家经济建设日益增长的需要。为此，今年地质勘探的工作总量比一九五四年大大增加了，其中仅钻探的工作量就增加了十四万七千多公尺。同时，地质勘探的成本也要大力降低，以节约国家的资金。
    会议确定一九五五年完成地质勘探任务的主要措施是：（一）加强科学研究工作。编制全国矿产分布图、地质研究程度图、矿产推断图等，加以研究，以便为大规模的地质普查工作指示方向；进一步研究已经普查和勘探的矿产地，总结经验，提高地质勘探工作的理论、技术水平；加强实验研究工作，提高岩矿鉴定、化学分析、加工试验等的技术水平。（二）提高勘探设计质量，使设计更加切合实际；同时贯彻以最经济的工作量取得最大效果的设计原则，克服只管完成任务不计成本的浪费思想。（三）加强地质勘探的管理工作，制订和贯彻地质工作的各种规范和技术标准，建立责任制度，推行定额管理和作业计划，以保证工作质量、节约资金和提高劳动生产率。（四）全面学习苏联先进经验，有领导、有组织、有制度地贯彻苏联专家建议。（五）加强政治思想工作，提高广大职工的政治思想水平和工作积极性，更好地完成一九五五年繁重的地质勘探任务。
    到会人员还听了苏联专家和我国地质工作者所作的一些专门性的报告。
