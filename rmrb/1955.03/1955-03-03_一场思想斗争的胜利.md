A Victory in Ideological Struggle
Sun Shisen

The "Xie Min" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Fengshanqian Village, Fengjie Township, Fengshan District, Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, was established in early October of the lunar calendar last year. While organizing the cooperative, the farmers collectively sowed seeds. As the saying goes, "Don't invite guests without dishes, don't plant wheat without fertilizer." Locally, it is customary to use fertilizer powder when planting winter wheat. Thus, as soon as the cooperative was established, it had to spend money to buy fertilizer. Strangely enough! Usually, the members speak enthusiastically when discussing issues, so why did everyone clam up and say nothing when discussing investment? After a long while, someone would utter a word or two, either complaining about difficulties or saying they had no money. Even the cooperative chairman, Zhang Fengyun, had reservations about this matter, so he had nothing to say. The issue of buying fertilizer was thus deadlocked.

The members calculated that at least 800,000 yuan in old currency was needed for the base and top dressing fertilizer for the cooperative's 50 mu of winter wheat. The cooperative didn't have a single penny at the moment, and the fields were in urgent need of fertilizer. The members were all anxious, with words stuck in their stomachs that they couldn't express. Chairman Zhang Fengyun thought to himself when he returned home at night: "As the chairman, I must be responsible for the cooperative's production. Seeing that winter wheat cannot be sown without fertilizer, can I ignore it?" He thought about investing more money, but he was afraid that if the cooperative didn't run well and collapsed, the invested money would be wasted. But if he didn't take the lead in investing, it wouldn't be reasonable, because there were only two middle-peasant households in the entire cooperative, and he was one of them. After much deliberation, the next day he sold a few catties of jute and invested 20,000 yuan in old currency in the cooperative as a show of support. Regardless of how much he invested, the chairman had at least taken the lead, and the members of the management committee also came out, running from house to house. The members contributed 10,000 here, 5,000 there, and barely managed to scrape together 100,000 yuan in old currency. With this money, they bought dozens of catties of fertilizer powder, which was just enough to sow the winter wheat.

Such investment could only be described as a "hemostatic drug." After the "bleeding" was stopped, the root of the "disease" remained. The members each had their own thoughts. Poor peasant members Pan Zhongting and Zhang Shengchun, because they had no money to invest, were embarrassed to speak ill of others in person, but behind their backs they gossiped: "Oh! The cooperative talks about mutual assistance and mutual benefit, which sounds nice, but no one is willing to put out money to buy a little fertilizer powder. What kind of cooperative is this?" Middle peasant member Zhang Wenhua also had his own ideas: "First, my field is very fertile, so it doesn't matter if I use less fertilizer. If you people with lean fields don't invest, why should I, with a fertile field, invest? Second, the cooperative has just been established, and no one knows whether it will be consolidated. If it collapses, who will I ask for the invested money?" After a period of time, the top dressing season arrived again, and the situation was exactly the same as at the beginning of planting. You said you had no money, and I said I had no money. After discussing it back and forth, the management committee only had one solution—to borrow money from the bank.

The issue of borrowing money from the bank was raised for discussion at the members' meeting, and some members disagreed. Zhang Xianming said: "Our cooperative is not without money, why should we borrow from the state?" This sentence pierced everyone's concerns. Even Zhang Fengyun felt that this matter was inappropriate, and an ideological struggle arose within him: Clearly, we have money stored at home that we are unwilling to invest, yet we rely on the state. Even if we borrow money from the bank, we have to pay interest. It's truly a loss on both ends to have money sitting idle at home and not utilizing it. Furthermore, if I don't take out my own money, how can I lead the other members later? As a Communist Party member, if I don't actively take the lead in investing and the cooperative's production doesn't improve, how can the cooperative be consolidated? But on the other hand, he thought that if only he invested more and others didn't, it would be "impossible to clap with one hand," and he would end up suffering a loss. After much deliberation, he was caught in a dilemma.

The Party branch and the comrades working in the village raised the investment issue as an important matter for discussion at every meeting, hoping that everyone would find a way to solve it. After repeated education, Zhang Fengyun's thinking began to change. He thought: Last time at the meeting in the county, the superiors explained the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, saying: "Cooperatives can rationally apply fertilizer." But I am always afraid of suffering losses and unwilling to invest. No wonder others are also unwilling to invest. We ourselves are ruining the cooperative. He also thought that, as a Communist Party member, he should implement the Party's policies, rely well on the poor peasants, consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, and take the lead in running the agricultural producers' cooperative well. Furthermore, the time for top dressing waits for no one. If we don't hurry up and apply top dressing now, the harvest will be difficult to guarantee; if the cooperative has a poor harvest, I will suffer losses as well. After a struggle, his thoughts gradually became clear. So he discussed it with his family for a while, and immediately took out 300,000 yuan in old currency from selling soybeans and 100,000 yuan in old currency from bank savings bonds to invest in the cooperative.

The news that the chairman had taken the lead in investing spread quickly in the village. The next day, middle peasant Zhang Wenhua also followed suit and invested 200,000 yuan in old currency. Following that, the cooperative's management committee discussed a method for members to invest according to output, stipulating that a monthly interest rate of one and a half percent would be paid on the surplus portion. As a result, other members also began to invest. Only five genuinely struggling members did not invest. By mid-December of the lunar calendar, the cooperative had raised more than 1.2 million yuan in old currency, exceeding the planned investment by one-third; soon after, they bought fertilizer powder and manure. On the second day of the first lunar month this year, the members were all in high spirits, going to the fields to apply top dressing, ensuring that everyone received a universal application. Now the cooperative still has a lot of working capital. The members all said: "This is what a real cooperative should be, and production is sure to be guaranteed!" The farmers outside the cooperative also said: "The members truly have socialist consciousness, and this year's production will definitely be done well!"

    一场思想斗争的胜利
    孙世森
    浙江省丽水县凤山区凤街乡凤山前村“协民”农业生产合作社是去年夏历十月初成立的。农民们一边办社，一边集体播种。俗语说的好：“没配（菜）勿请客，没肥勿种麦。”当地种冬麦是习惯用肥田粉的，这样，社刚刚建立起来，就得拿钱去买肥料。真奇怪！平常社员们讨论问题时发言满热烈，为什么讨论起投资问题来，人们都闭起嘴巴，一言不发了呢？老半天有人开口讲一两句，不是叫困难，就是说没钱。就连社长张凤云对这件事也有顾虑，所以也没话好讲。买肥料的事情就这样僵住了。
    社员们算了算全社五十亩冬麦的基肥和追肥，起码需要旧币八十万元。眼前社里连一个钱都没有，田里又迫切需要肥料，社员们个个都急得蹬脚，有话闷在肚里讲不得。社长张凤云夜里回到家里还在想：“我是社长，总要负责社里生产，眼看冬麦没肥料不能下种，难道不管吗？”他想多拿点钞票去投资吧，又怕将来社办不好，垮了台，投资的钞票就会白瞎。可是不带头投资吧，道理上也讲不通，因为社里总共只有两户中农，而自己就是其中的一户。他左思右想，第二天就卖了几斤洛麻，向社投资了旧币两万元表表样。不论投多投少，社长总算带了头，管理委员会的委员们也都出来，东家跑西家跑，社员们就你一万、我五千，好容易才凑成了旧币十多万元。用这笔钱买来了几十斤肥田粉，总算勉强地把冬麦种下去了。
    这样的投资只能说是“止血药”，“血”止住以后，“病”根还是没除掉。社员肚里各有各的想法。贫农社员潘钟亭和张生春，因为自己没钱投资，当面不好意思讲别人，背后却在议论着：“哦！合作社互助互利，讲起来好听，可是连买点肥田粉的钱都没人肯出，还像什么合作社呢！”中农社员张文华也有他自己的想法：“一来我的田很肥，肥料少用点没关系；你们田瘦的人都不投资，我田肥的人还用投什么资呢？二来现在社新建起来，巩固不巩固谁也没个数，要是垮台了，投资的钞票向谁要呢！”过了一段时间，追肥的季节又到来了，情况和种田开始时一模一样，你也说没钱，我也说没钱。管理委员会讨论来讨论去，只有一个办法——向银行借款。
    向银行贷款的问题被提到社员大会上讨论，有些社员不同意。张显明说：“我们社里并不是没有钱，为什么要向国家借款？”这一句话就戳破了大家的心事。就是张凤云也觉得这件事不妥当，内心里起了斗争：明明家里有钱存着不投资，却去依赖国家，就是从银行借来钱也要付利息，家里有钞票闲存着不利用，真是两头吃亏。再说，自己家里有钱不拿出来，以后怎么去领导社员呢？自己是一个共产党员，要是不积极带头投资，社里生产搞不好，社怎么巩固呢？但是反过来他又想到，光是自己多投资，别人不投资，也是“只手打不响”，弄得自己吃亏。想来想去，左右为难。
    党支部和在村里工作的同志在每次开会时都把投资问题作为一个重要的问题提出来讨论，希望大家想办法解决。经过多次教育，张凤云的思想开始转变了。他想：前次在县里开会，上级说明农业社的优越性时讲过：“合作社可以合理施肥”。但是自己却老是怕吃亏不肯投资，难怪其他人也不愿投资。这就是我们自己糟蹋了合作社。他又想到，作为一个共产党员，应该执行党的政策，很好地去依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农，带头办好农业生产合作社。再说追肥的时间不再等人了，现在要是不赶快追肥，收成就难保证；社里要是歉收，自己同样会受损失。经过一场思想斗争，他的思想逐渐明朗起来了。于是他便和家里人商量了一阵，马上拿出卖黄豆的旧币三十万元和旧币十万元银行储蓄券送到社里来投资。
    社长带头投资的消息立刻在村里传开了，第二天，中农张文华也跟着投资旧币二十万元。接着，社的管理委员会就讨论出社员按产量投资的办法，规定超额部分付月利一分半。这样一来，其他社员也就开始投资了，只有五户真正困难的社员，没有投资。到夏历十二月中旬，全社就凑起了旧币一百二十多万元的资金，超过预定投资计划三分之一；不久便买来了肥田粉和粪。今年夏历正月初二这一天，社员个个情绪高涨，下田追肥，做到普遍追一次。现在社里还存着许多周转资金。社员们都说：“这样才真叫合作社，生产一定有保证！”社外的农民也说：“社员真有社会主义觉悟，今年的生产一定会搞得好！”
