    Under the Guidance of Soviet Teachers
    Wu Yafeng
    The Soviet experts helping to build the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant steadfastly adhere to the belief that they should not only help our country build this modern thermal power plant, but also cultivate a group of workers and cadres who can independently handle this complex technical work during the construction process. Thanks to the systematic training and assistance from Soviet experts in the construction process, the basic construction workers and technical personnel of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant not only ensured the quality of the project, but also improved their technical level, and the technical strength grew rapidly.
    In actual construction, Soviet experts enthusiastically imparted various operating techniques to our site's technical cadres and all workers. The installation of a certain turbine and double cylinder was an extremely complex and meticulous task. It was the first time that we had installed such new equipment in our country. Our technical personnel encountered many difficulties in the leveling and alignment work of the lower cylinder. When turbine expert Gukimov learned of this, he personally performed the leveling and alignment operation four or five times in a row, teaching the techniques to the workers in actual operation. Installing pipes on the steam drum was another very complex task in the boiler construction project. Workers had to connect the steam pipes to the steam drum, using a tube expander instead of electric or gas welding at the joints to prevent water leakage. This was another unfamiliar technical task for the workers. Boiler expert Zhbanov personally drilled into the steam drum and expanded the first pipe during the expansion of a certain boiler. While expanding, he explained to the workers how to correctly master the tube expander and the precautions during operation. Then he watched the workers expand the pipes until each worker fully mastered the technique. Thanks to the expert's enthusiastic and responsible teaching of techniques, the hydraulic test of several boilers in the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant was successful on the first try, with no pipes leaking, ensuring quality. The workers learned this new technology.
    Soviet experts paid special attention to explaining the relevant technical theoretical knowledge that must be understood in practical work to technical cadres and workers, so that we could master some technical operation problems from a technical theoretical perspective. Expert Koshak, who was in charge of the civil engineering construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, gathered the technical personnel as soon as he arrived at the construction site and spent a month patiently explaining the characteristics, steps, and methods of winter construction. After the winter construction started, Koshak often questioned each worker who poured concrete or laid bricks like a teacher, telling them the theoretical basis of many techniques in winter construction, and then listened to the workers' answers to these questions. Electrical expert Malyukov also seized the time to explain the theoretical knowledge and precautions related to the installation of oil switches and transformers to the technical personnel before the start of the electrical construction site. Chemical expert Mikhailovsky, who arrived at the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant construction site in October last year, tested more than 20 workers working in the chemical water treatment department in the first three days. When he found that some technical personnel and workers did not even understand the preliminary principles of chemical technology, he suggested that the construction leadership department quickly organize a training class, in which he personally gave two hours of lectures each time.
    The technical strength of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant construction site has grown rapidly, which not only guaranteed the needs of the project, but also supported construction in various places. The construction and installation workers who grew up in the construction project of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant have been put into new construction projects in various places batch after batch. Following the successive transfer of more than 400 civil engineering construction workers to Shijiazhuang, more than 140 excellent installation workers have also been transferred to Shaanxi, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shandong, Hebei and other places. Some workers were also assigned to various winter construction sites in Taiyuan to help these construction sites with the winter construction experience they had accumulated under the training of Soviet experts. When equipment installation began in June last year, more than 25% of the installation workers were apprentices. Now more than 200 apprentices have become installation technicians, some of whom are already fourth-grade workers. Among the original technicians, four eighth-grade workers have been promoted to technicians, and one hundred and seventy-five outstanding workers have been upgraded.
    The spirit of Soviet experts who have worked tirelessly to help us over the past year has left an indelible impression on us. All the staff and workers participating in the construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant sincerely thank the Soviet experts for their sincere and selfless cultivation of construction talents for us. They will continue to learn humbly from Soviet experts in future projects, and strive for the complete and successful completion of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant.

    在苏联老师的教导下
    吴亚峰
    帮助建设太原电热厂的苏联专家们，在工作中坚定地执行着这样的信条：不仅要帮助我国把这座近代化的电热厂建设好，而且要在建设过程中为我国培养出一批能够独立担当这种复杂技术工作的工人和干部。建设太原电热厂的基本建设工人和技术人员，在建设工程中由于得到了苏联专家系统的培养和帮助，不但保证了工程质量，而且提高了技术水平，技术力量迅速地成长了。
    苏联专家在实际施工中，都非常热情地向我们工地的技术干部和全体工人传授各种操作技术。某号汽轮机和双汽缸的安装是一件极其复杂和细致的工作，在我国安装这样的新设备还是第一次，我们的技术人员在下汽室进行找平找正的工作中，遇到很多困难，汽机专家古基莫夫知道这件事以后，就连续四五次的亲自动手进行找平找正的操作，在实际操作中把技术教给工人们。安装汽包上的管子，是建设锅炉工程中又一件十分复杂的工作。工人们必须把汽管通到气包中去，接口上不用电焊或气焊，而只能用涨管器操作，使它不漏水。这对工人们又是一件陌生的技术工作。锅炉专家日班诺夫便在某号锅炉进行涨管时，亲自钻到汽包内涨了第一根管子，他一面涨，一面给工人们讲解如何正确地掌握涨管器和操作时应注意的事项，然后他又看着工人涨，直到每一个工人都完全掌握了这种技术为止。由于专家这样热心负责地传授技术，太原电热厂的几个锅炉水压试验一次就成功了，没有一根管子漏水，保证了质量。工人们学会了这套新技术。
    苏联专家特别注意向技术干部和工人们讲解在实际工作中所必须了解的有关技术理论知识，以便使我们从技术理论上来掌握一些技术操作问题。担负太原电热厂土木建筑工程的专家柯沙克刚刚到达工地，就召集了技术人员，连续花了一个月的时间给他们耐心地讲解冬季施工的特点、步骤和方法。冬季施工开始后，柯沙克又经常像老师
  一样地考问每个浇灌混凝土或砌砖的工人，告诉他们冬季施工中许多技术的理论根据，再倾听工人回答这些问题。电气专家马留科夫在电气工地开工前，也抓紧向技术人员讲解了有关油开关变压器等安装的理论知识和注意事项。化学专家米哈依洛夫斯基，去年十月一来到太原电热厂工地，头三天就对在化学水处理部门工作的二十多个工人进行了测验，当他发现有些技术人员和工人连初步的化学技术原理都不懂时，就建议施工领导部门很快地举办了一个训练班，由他每次亲自去讲两小时课。
    太原电热厂工地的技术力量迅速地成长起来了，这不但保证了工程的需要，而且还支援了各地建设。太原电热厂建设工程中成长起来的建筑、安装工人们，一批接一批地投入了各地新的建设工程。紧接着四百多名土木建筑工人陆续调往石家庄以后，一百四十多名优秀的安装工人也先后被调往陕西、兰州、天津、山东、河北等地。还有部分工人分配到太原各冬季施工工地，以他们在苏联专家们培养下所积累起来的冬季施工经验，帮助这些工地施工。去年六月开始设备安装时，安装工人中有百分之二十五以上是徒工，现在已有二百多名学徒成为安装技术工人，其中有的已是四级工、在原来的技术工人中，有四个八级工人已提升为技师，一七五个优秀的工人都升级了。
    苏联专家一年来不辞劳苦帮助我们的工作精神，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象，参加建设太原电热厂的全体职工衷心地感谢苏联专家真诚无私的为我们培养了建设人才。他们将要在今后的工程中，继续虚心地向苏联专家学习，争取太原电热厂全部胜利地建设完成。
