People on the Kangzang Plateau can now see the latest books and newspapers published in the interior. In the past, newspapers and periodicals published in Beijing were transported by car to Qamdo and then had to go through forty-eight horse stations before being sent to Lhasa, which took two months. Now, the fast ones can meet readers in about half a month.

After the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, some Tibetan families in towns along the highways can already see newly published Tibetan versions of People's Pictorial and Tibetan books. In the first two and a half months of this year, the Lhasa Supply Station of the Xinhua Bookstore Tibet Branch shipped more than 34,000 books, which is more than were shipped in the two years before the opening of the highway. Before the end of 1954, there were only seven types of newspapers and periodicals issued by the post office in the Tibet region. In the first quarter of this year alone, the Lhasa Post and Telecommunications Bureau issued 202 types of newspapers and periodicals, with more than 100,000 copies already issued. In the Bomi area, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, people could only see newspapers from three to six months ago before the opening of the Kangzang Highway. Now, postal vans bring new books and newspapers every few days. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    康藏高原上看到了新书报
    康藏高原上的人们已能看到内地新近出版的书报了。过去北京出版的报刊，由汽车运到昌都后，还要经过四十八个马站后才能寄到拉萨，需要两个月；现在快的半个月左右就可和读者见面了。
    康藏、青藏公路通车后，在公路沿线城镇的有些藏民家里，已可以看到新近出版的藏文版人民画报和藏文书籍。在今年的两个半月里，新华书店西藏分店拉萨供应站运到的书籍达三万四千多册；比公路通车前两年多时间内运到的还多。一九五四年年底以前，西藏地区经邮局发行的报刊一共才有七种，今年第一季度，光是拉萨邮电局发行的报刊就有二百零二种了，已经发出的达十万多份。在雪山环绕的波密区，康藏公路通车前只能看到三个月到半年以前的报纸，现在邮政班车每隔几天就带来了新书报。　（据新华社讯）
