    The American Economy in 1954
    A. Manukyan (Soviet Union)

    (I)
    American bourgeois newspapers have published materials on the state of the American economy in the past year, as well as forecasts for the future, attempting to distort the facts and mislead public opinion. Therefore, it is appropriate to clarify the real situation.

    Steel production is one of the basic indicators of a country's economic situation. In 1954, steel production in the United States decreased by 21.1 million tons compared to 1953; this figure is more than twice the amount reduced during the crisis year of 1949. Bituminous coal production decreased by 54 million tons. Automobile production decreased by 10.2 percent, and trucks decreased by 15.3 percent. Tractor production decreased by 36 percent compared to 1953, machine tool production decreased by 26 percent, and railway car production decreased by 56 percent.

    The production of clothing and leather goods decreased by 5 percent, textiles by 9 percent, and furniture by 11 percent. We should also remember that due to the intensification of the arms race, the production of daily necessities in the United States had already decreased significantly in 1953 compared to previous years. The significant decline in production brought the production of textiles and leather goods in 1954 down to the lowest level since the war, the level of 1949.

    The overall industrial production index in 1954 decreased by 6.7 percent compared to 1953, the same amount of decline as from 1948 to 1949.

    The militarization of the American economy failed to prevent the sharp decline in production in several important industrial sectors and the significant decline in the overall level of industrial production.

    1954 was a year of industrial crisis in the United States.

    The economic crisis drastically worsened the living conditions of American workers. The number of employed people decreased significantly, while the number of fully unemployed people doubled. Despite the working class's stubborn opposition to capitalists' attempts to reduce wages, the total amount of wages in the manufacturing industry in 1954 still decreased by 9 percent compared to 1953. At the same time, the prices of daily necessities continued to rise sharply, and the prices of goods purchased by workers in 1954 rose to the highest level in American history.

    For most of the year, the number of fully unemployed people was two million more than in 1953.

    (II)
    1954 was a year of further development of the agricultural crisis in the United States.

    The decreasing demand for American agricultural products from Western European countries, the increase in exports from countries competing with the United States, and the disappearance of the temporary needs caused by the American imperialist-launched war of aggression against Korea severely hit American exports. The value of American agricultural exports decreased by 25 percent in the 1953-54 fiscal year compared to the 1951-52 fiscal year.

    The total value of unsold commodity inventories withdrawn from the market and held by the "Commodity Credit Corporation" increased from $1.4 billion at the end of June 1952 to $6.9 billion at the end of November 1954, and is still growing.

    Wholesale prices of agricultural products continued to fall, now down 24 percent from February 1951, which has led to a continuous decline in farmers' income. The difference between the prices of goods sold by farmers and the goods they buy has increased significantly. The purchasing power of farmers in 1954 decreased by 7.5 percent compared to 1953, and by 35.6 percent compared to 1947.

    The agricultural crisis is very clearly reflected in the practice of forced reduction of planting areas. This practice has now been extended to major crops such as wheat, corn, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and rice. The forced reduction of the planting area for wheat, cotton, and tobacco harvested in 1954, which was implemented in 1953, did not eliminate overproduction, and now further and more stringent measures are being implemented to reduce the planting area. The planned reductions in the planting area for the 1955 harvest, compared to 1953, are as follows: wheat 30 percent, cotton 28 percent, and tobacco 15 percent. This year is the first year for implementing restrictions on rice planting, with a reduction of 25 percent.

    In order to eliminate "surplus" inventories, the U.S. government has adopted dumping methods, with all losses falling on taxpayers. Export subsidies in 1953 only applied to all exported wheat, and then were extended to corn, oats, and barley. Grains, cotton, and tobacco have begun to be sold in the currency of the importing country, which is used as funding for building military bases in those locations (such as in the case of Spain). In March 1954, the United States and Canada began a real "price war" on wheat exports.

    At the same time, it is worth pointing out that despite the sharp drop in prices received by farmers, the prices paid by consumers have hardly decreased at all, and remain at the highest level.

    Butter consumption in 1953 decreased by 48.8 percent compared to the average of the five pre-war years, which is precisely because of high prices.

    The serious situation of American agriculture is also reflected in industry. Sales of industrial products to farmers have fallen more significantly than the overall retail sales.

   (III)
    However, we must not ignore some new trends that emerged in the American economy at the end of 1954.

    The industrial production index, which had fallen to 123 points in July and August (with the 1947-1949 level as 100), rose again to 124 in September, 126 in October, 129 in November, and 130 in December. The number dropped by 14 points from the highest index (137 in July 1953) to the lowest index (123). The above-mentioned rise between August and December "restored" half of that. The steel industry's operating rate, which had fallen to 65 percent of production capacity in the summer of 1954, reached 85 percent at the end of the year. At the same time, the stock prices of various manufacturing companies at the end of the year were 44 percent higher than the level at the end of 1953.

    Some increase in steel production was predictable because, for most of the year, steel production had fallen by 20 to 25 percent compared to last year, while steel consumption had decreased by at most 10 to 15 percent.

    The main reason for the rise in steel production at the end of 1954 was the expansion of automobile production. Automobile companies not only produced 1955 models earlier than ever before, but also tried to produce as many cars as possible as quickly as possible. The reason is that competition in the American automobile industry has become unprecedentedly fierce.

    The cars produced in large quantities in the fourth quarter of 1954 were all 1955 models, which means that fewer cars will have to be produced this year.

    However, trade publications have already noted that 1955 model cars are already being sold at discounted prices. The inventory of unsold new cars at retail dealerships is rising rapidly. And their inventory of used cars, which they have taken in for resale but still cannot sell, is growing even faster.

    The monopoly capitalists of the automobile industry deliberately raised automobile production to levels exceeding current sales, apparently intending to accumulate enough cars before the spring so that they could threaten workers with shutdowns during the negotiations for new collective contracts with workers from April to June this year.

    Residential construction in the United States reached a high level in 1954. However, the expansion of residential construction is almost entirely based on increasing debt. Private debt due to urban real estate has quadrupled from 1945 to the present, from $18.5 billion to $74.6 billion, and is continuing to grow at an unprecedented rate.

    The foundation of the stock market boom is even more unstable.

    The expansion of large monopolies' net profits due to the abolition of the excess profits tax has promoted the rise in stocks. Obviously, the new growth of stock market speculation is related to the United States' efforts to obtain approval for the London and Paris Agreements, which pave the way for rearming West Germany; it is also related to the United States' intensifying provocative activities against the People's Republic of China. Stock prices of aviation and other military industrial companies have risen even more rapidly.

    (IV)
    If we analyze the profound processes occurring in the American economy that are determining the development of events, we will have sufficient reason to believe that even with temporary production increases, and with this extremely contradictory rise, we can determine that this is related to the cyclical crisis phenomenon in the United States. In light of this, it is important to point out that U.S. investment in fixed capital in the fourth quarter of 1954 decreased by 10.1 percent compared to the same quarter of 1953.

    According to estimates by "Business Week" magazine, investment in fixed capital in 1955 will be reduced by 5 percent compared to last year, with a reduction of 7 percent in the manufacturing industry, 10 percent in the transportation industry, and 18 percent in the mining industry.

    The view of British economist Haberler is noteworthy. He wrote: "US investment in fixed capital reached its highest level in mid-1953. The subsequent decline is slow, gradual, but also very persistent. Generally speaking, this is an extremely long and obvious curve. This degree of decline can be compensated by the rise of other departments, but it is probably difficult for it to change its direction within a few years."

    This estimate of fixed capital investment is very closely related to one of the most significant phenomena in the modern American economic situation: the increasing excess of production capacity. The excess of production capacity is clearly manifested in all sectors.

    The constant underutilization of enterprises, which is a characteristic of the general crisis of capitalism and is particularly evident in the United States, has caused many enterprises to close down.

    Recently, "Steel Trust" alone closed the open-hearth workshop with a production capacity of one million tons in the Homestead factory, as well as the open-hearth workshops in the Duquesne and Vandergrift factories. In the coal mining industry, thousands of coal mines have closed down. The number of workers in the bituminous coal industry has decreased from 425,000 in 1947 to 200,500. The number of anthracite coal workers has decreased from 79,000 to 25,000 during the same period. There have also been temporary shutdowns in the automobile industry. For example, the Hudson Company's factory only operated 12 to 13 percent of the time in 1954. The closure of factories in the textile industry, the knitwear industry, and the rayon industry is even more common.

    Now, in the face of the crisis, capitalists are striving to seize maximum profits by leveraging their class policies implemented over the years. Demolishing old enterprises, concentrating production in a few factories with the best technical equipment in areas with the lowest wages, unlimited intensification of labor, and brutal capitalist-style rationalization of production all accurately reflect the essence of the American economic situation.

    The intensification of oppression of the working class has led to a decline in the wage fund that far exceeds the decline in production volume. For example, in 1954, the products of the manufacturing industry decreased by 6.6 percent compared to 1953, while the total amount of wages decreased by 8.8 percent. In addition to the wage losses caused by the reduction in production, billions of dollars have also been squeezed from workers due to the intensification of exploitation.

    (V)
    The development of the American economic cycle is carried out under the conditions of a continuous, comprehensive, and all-encompassing militarization of the capitalist economy.

    In the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 1954, the U.S. military order budget was equal to twice that of the previous year.

    Eisenhower's budget for the 1955-56 fiscal year is a budget for a large-scale expansion of the air force and the production of atomic weapons. Eisenhower intends to retain the most egregious and appalling tax laws in American history for the next eighteen months.

    The budget also prepares to "supply certain types of military supplies needed by the new German armed forces" and stipulates huge appropriations for the so-called "Common Security Program," that is, preparations for aggression in Europe, the Near East, and the Far East.

      "The Wall Street Journal," in welcoming the new budget, said with hope: "Like in the past few years, military spending will become the most important pillar of business." In the collusion to arm West Germany, in which American monopoly capitalists are actively participating, and in the tense situation in the Far East, Wall Street monopoly capitalists hope for another "Korean prosperity."

    However, the militarization of the capitalist economy only exacerbates its unresolved contradictions and inevitably strengthens the role of the basic factors that constitute the economic crisis.

    The U.S. monopoly capitalists are betting on militarization, preparing for new wars, and related measures, which will lead to a continued increase in the number of unemployed, heavier taxes, and a decline in real wages and farmers' income. All of this will inevitably widen the gap between production capacity and the constantly declining purchasing power of the people, further lower the living standards of the masses, and make the economic crisis more profound and acute.

    一九五四年的美国经济
    苏联  阿·马努基扬
    （一）
    美国的资产阶级报纸发表了一些关于过去一年美国经济情况的材料以及对未来的展望，企图借此以歪曲事实、迷惑社会舆论。因此，来阐明一下真实的情况是适宜的。
    钢的产量是说明一国经济情况的基本指标之一；一九五四年美国的钢产量较一九五三年减少了二千一百一十万吨；这个数字相当于发生危机的一九四九年所减产的数量的二倍以上。烟煤的产量降低了五千四百万吨。汽车产量降低百分之十点二，载重汽车降低百分之十五点三。拖拉机产量比一九五三年降低了百分之三十六，工作母机产量降低百分之二十六，铁路货车产量降低了百分之五十六。
    衣服及皮革制品的生产下降百分之五，纺织品下降百分之九，家具下降百分之十一。我们还应该记得：由于加强军备竞赛，美国日用品的生产早在一九五三年就已较前数年下降得很多了。生产的显著下降使一九五四年的纺织品及皮革制品下落到战后最低的一九四九年的水平。
    一九五四年的工业生产总指数比一九五三年降低了百分之六点七，和一九四九年比一九四八年的下降的数目相同。
    美国经济的军事化并未能阻止若干重要工业部门生产的锐减和工业生产总水平的显著下降。
    一九五四年是美国工业危机的一年。
    经济危机使美国劳动者的生活情况急剧恶化。在业人数大大降低，而完全失业的人数增加了一倍。尽管工人阶级顽强地反对资本家降低工资的企图，而制造业的工资总额一九五四年仍较一九五三年降低了百分之九。同时，日用品价格不断剧涨，为劳动者所购买的商品的价格，一九五四年已涨至美国历来的最高水平。
    在这一年的大部时间中，完全失业的人数比一九五三年多二百万人。
    （二）
    一九五四年是美国农业危机进一步发展的一年。
    西欧国家对美国农产品需求量日益减少、同美国竞争的国家出口增加以及美帝国主义发动的侵朝战争而造成的暂时性需要的消失，因而使美国的出口受到严重的打击，美国的农产品出口额，一九五三—五四年度比一九五一—五二年度减少了百分之二十五。
    从市场抽出而由“商品信托公司”掌握的滞销商品存货总值由一九五二年六月底的十四亿美元增至一九五四年十一月底的六十九亿美元，而且现在还在继续增长。
    农产品批发价格不断下跌，现已比一九五一年二月跌落百分之二十四，这使农民的收入不断下降。农民出售的货物与买入的货物的价格之间的差别大大增加了。一九五四年农民的购买力比一九五三年降低百分之七点五，比一九四七年降低百分之三十五点六。
    农业危机极其鲜明地反映在强迫缩减播种面积的做法上。这种做法目前已扩展到像小麦、玉蜀黍、棉花、烟草、花生、大米等主要作物。一九五三年强迫缩减一九五四年收割的小麦、棉花、烟草播种面积，并未消灭生产过剩，而现在正实行更进一步的、更严厉的缩减播种面积的办法。计划缩减一九五五年收割的播种面积与一九五三年相较，所占百分比如下：小麦三十，棉花二十八，烟草十五。稻谷今年是实行限制播种的第一年，其缩减数为百分之二十五。
    为了消除“多余”的存货，美国政府采取了倾销的办法，其损失全部落在纳税人身上。出口补贴在一九五三年还只适用于全部出口的小麦，其后也扩展到玉蜀黍、燕麦、大麦。谷物、棉花、烟草已开始按进口国货币出售，用以作为在当地建筑军事基地的资金（例如在西班牙的情形）。一九五四年三月间，美国和加拿大在小麦出口上开始了真正的
  “价格战争”。
    同时，值得指出的是：尽管农民获得的价格剧跌，消费者所支付的价格实际上完全没有降低，而且还停留在最高的水平上。
    一九五三年牛油消费量比战前五年的平均数下降百分之四十八点八，这正是价格高昂的说明。
    美国农业的严重情况也反映在工业方面。工业品对农民的销售额比全部零售总额降落得更为显著。
   （三）
    但是我们绝不能忽略美国经济中一九五四年末出现的某些新趋势。
    七、八月份曾降至一百二十三点（一九四七—一九四九年水平为一百）的工业生产指数，到九月份又升至一百二十四，十月份一百二十六，十一月份一百二十九，十二月份一百三十。由最高指数（一九五三年七月份的一百三十七）降至最低指数
  （一百二十三），计十四点，由上述八月至十二月之间的上升数，“恢复了”一半。钢铁工业的开工率，一九五四年夏天曾降至生产能力百分之六十五，年终达到了百分之八十五。同时，各制造公司的股票牌价在年底比一九五三年底的水平高百分之四十四。
    钢产量的某些提高是可以预料得到的，因为在一年的大部分时间，钢的生产比去年跌落百分之二十到二十五，而当时钢的消费至多降低了百分之十到十五。
    一九五四年底钢的生产上升的主要原因是汽车生产的扩大。汽车公司不仅空前早地生产一九五五年型的汽车，而且还拚命尽快地生产出可能多的汽车。原因是美国汽车工业竞争空前尖锐化。
    一九五四年第四季大量生产的汽车都是一九五五年式的，这就是说，今年不得不少生产些。
    但在专业报纸上，已使人注意到一九五五年式汽车已经在按定价打折扣来销售了。零售代理行未售出的新汽车存量在迅速上升。而他们收来转售但仍未能销出的旧汽车存货增长得比这还要快。
    汽车工业的垄断资本家故意把汽车生产提高到超过目前销售量的水平，显然是打算在春季前就积存足够的汽车，以便能够在今年四月到六月与工人进行订立新的集体合同谈判时以停工来威胁工人。
    一九五四年美国的住宅建筑曾达到高度的水平。但是住宅建筑范围的扩大几乎完全建立在债务日增的基础上。私人因城市不动产而负的债务由一九四五年到现在已增到四倍，即由一百八十五亿美元增至七百四十六亿美元，而且还在以空前的速度继续增长中。
    交易所的繁荣的基础则更为不稳。
    由于取消了超额利得税，大垄断资本家的纯利扩大了，因而促进了股票的上涨。显然，交易所投机的新增长和美国力图使为重新武装西德开辟道路的伦敦和巴黎协定得到批准是有关的；同时也和美国对中华人民共和国加强挑衅活动有关。航空工业和其他军事工业公司的股票价格更是迅速上涨。
    （四）
    如果我们分析一下美国经济中所发生的决定着事态发展的深刻过程，我们就会有充足的理由相信：即使有着暂时性的生产上升，有着这种极具矛盾性的上升，我们也能断定这和美国周期的危机现象有关。由此看来，我们指出下面一点就很重要了，这就是美国一九五四年第四季对固定资本的投资较一九五三年同季下降了百分之十点一。
    据“商业周刊”杂志估计，一九五五年对固定资本的投资要比去年减少百分之五，其中制造业减少百分之七，运输业百分之十，矿业百分之十八。
    英国经济学者韩柏尔的看法是值得注意的。他写道：“美国对固定资本的投资到一九五三年中期达到最高水平。其后的下降是很缓慢的，是逐渐的，但也是很顽强的。一般说这是一个极漫长而明显的曲线。此种下降程度固可由其他部门的上升来补偿，但其自身恐怕很难会于数年间改变其方向。”
    固定资本的投资的这种估计和现代美国经济情况中一个最显著的现象——生产能力的日益过剩有着极密切的关系。生产能力过剩在一切部门中都清清楚楚地表现了出来。
    作为资本主义总危机期间特点的并在美国表现得特殊明显的企业的经常开工不足使许多企业倒闭。
    近来仅“钢铁托拉斯”一家就关闭了霍姆斯特德工厂生产能力一百万吨的马丁炉车间和杜昆纳、万德格列夫特工厂的马丁炉车间了。在煤矿工业中，数千煤矿倒闭。烟煤工业的工人数目由一九四七年的四十二万五千人减少到二十万零五千人。无烟煤工人在同期间由七万九千人减少到二万五千人。汽车工业中也有暂时停工的现象。例如赫德逊公司的工厂在一九五四年中仅开工百分之十二到十三。纺织工业、针织品工业及人造丝工业工厂的倒闭更是平常的现象。
    现在，在危机情况下，资本家努力借其多年来实行的阶级政策攫取最大利润。拆毁旧企业，在工资最低的地区将生产集中到少数技术设备最优良的工厂中，无限制地加强劳动强度，残酷的资本主义式的合理化生产，这一切现象都确切地反映着美国经济情况的本质。
    对工人阶级压迫的加强，已使工资基金的下降大大超过生产量的下降。例如，一九五四年制造业的产品较一九五三年下降百分之六点六，而工资总额的下降则为百分之八点八。除了因生产缩减而引起的工资损失外，更由于加强剥削，也从工人身上榨取了数十亿的美元。
    （五）
    美国经济循环的发展，是在持续不断的、全面的和无所不包的资本主义经济军事化的过程的条件下进行的。
    在一九五四年七月一日起的财政年度中，美国军事订货预算等于前一年度的两倍。
    艾森豪威尔提出的一九五五——五六财政年度的预算是一个大量扩充空军和原子武器生产的预算。艾森豪威尔打算在未来的十八个月中保留美国有史以来最恶劣的惊人的税法。
    预算中还准备“供给新的德国武装力量所需要的某种类型的军需品”，并规定以巨额拨款供给所谓“共同安全计划”，也就是说在欧洲、近东和远东进行侵略的准备工作。
      “华尔街日报”在欢迎新预算时，抱着希望说：“像过去几年一样，军事支出将成为商业的最主要支柱。”在美国垄断资本家的积极参加下的武装西德勾当中，在远东的紧张情况中，华尔街的垄断资本家希望再来一次“朝鲜的繁荣”。
    但是资本主义经济的军事化只有使其原未解决的矛盾更趋尖锐，不可避免地加强那些构成经济危机的基本因素的作用。
    美国垄断资本家把赌注押在军事化、准备新战争和有关的措施上，这样就会使失业者继续增加，赋税更加沉重，实际工资和农民收入下降。这一切都不可避免地会扩大生产能力和不断下降的人民购买力之间的鸿沟，使人民大众的生活水准进一步下降，使经济危机更为加深和尖锐。
