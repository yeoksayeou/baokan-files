    Oppose Waste in Construction

    In our country's socialist construction plan, the construction of office buildings, dormitories, schools, hospitals, and other auxiliary buildings for industrial construction occupies a significant position. In recent years, tens of millions of square meters of various buildings have been constructed nationwide in the above areas. In 1953 alone, the state directly invested in the construction of more than 30 million square meters of housing, of which about 12 million square meters were residential. Such a prosperous scene in the construction industry has never existed in any era of Chinese history. Only in the People's China, due to the high concern of the Party and the People's Government for the people's cultural and material life, is it possible to include these buildings in the national plan, making them an important component of the national construction plan, and carrying out these constructions on such a large scale. However, precisely because of this, these buildings should also be subject to the requirements of national construction, and should not deviate from the path of the national plan, or from the economic interests of the country and the actual needs of the people.

    What are the state's requirements for construction? The principles of construction have long been pointed out by the Party and the government. This is that all buildings should be practical, economical, and, where possible, aesthetically pleasing. Practicality means serving the needs of the state and the people, which is always the most important issue in construction. For example, auxiliary buildings in factories must meet the requirements of production and facilitate production and work; schools must facilitate learning; and hospitals must be convenient for medical treatment and patient use. If this is not the case, the building will lose its value. Economy means conforming to the current national financial resources and the people's living standards, maximizing the rational and economical use of state investment, and building more houses with less money to better meet the needs of the country and the people. Disregarding economic effects in construction and pursuing luxury and grandeur is a violation of this principle and harms the interests of socialist construction. The aesthetic appeal of buildings is certainly important, and we never deny architectural art and advocate ugliness. However, apart from a few special buildings whose main purpose is to meet artistic requirements, the aesthetic appeal of buildings should generally not violate the principles of practicality and economy. Beauty without practicality means sacrificing major interests for minor interests; beauty without economy is not only a waste of national financial resources, but also often makes it impossible for people who need housing to afford it due to high costs, and the result cannot be considered practical.

    What is the main erroneous tendency in current construction? It is a lack of attention to the economic principles of construction. At present, we are intensively carrying out industrial construction, and the country's funds and the people's income are limited. We must strive to promote thrift and oppose waste. In construction, pursuing extravagance and luxury without paying attention to economy, spending more money than necessary and building fewer houses than possible, deviates from the people's living reality and violates the national construction policy of concentrating all financial and material resources on industrial construction first. This cannot be tolerated. Therefore, all construction units, departments managing construction, design institutions, and architects must be required to pay attention to the cost of each square meter during design and construction, adopt advanced technologies, accelerate the progress of construction, reduce construction costs, and, under these conditions, create architectural images that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing.

    One manifestation of waste in current construction is that some agencies and enterprises, regardless of the importance and urgency, blindly construct buildings, resulting in the construction of many buildings that could be built or not built, and the over-construction or large-scale construction of many buildings that did not need to be over-constructed or large-scale constructed. As a result, a large amount of national funds is occupied, and a lot of manpower and material resources are wasted. A sanatorium in the Northwest, with only thirty beds, occupies nearly 6,000 square meters of building area, with few people going for recuperation and very low utilization rate. Beijing built 86 auditoriums in 1953 and 1954, some of which were decorated very luxuriously. In fact, many auditoriums are idle most of the time and used rarely. Why can't such buildings be reduced? Even if they must be built, why can't several departments jointly construct and use them together? If we build in a planned way, wouldn't we save a lot of funds?

    Another manifestation of waste in construction is the pursuit of so-called "70-year modernization, 100-year vision," raising construction standards and construction costs without any restrictions. According to the statistics of three buildings, namely the "Geological Palace" in Changchun, the Harbin Medical University, and the Anshan Design Building, the cost per square meter is mostly between 240 and 300 yuan. The cost of these three buildings alone exceeds the national standard by more than 7 million yuan, which can be used to build more than 90,000 square meters of dormitories at 80 yuan per square meter. Some buildings in Beijing also cost more than 320 yuan per square meter. The newly built staff dormitories of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, due to the high standards of construction and equipment, have a minimum monthly rent of 18 yuan and a maximum of 41 yuan, which is two to six times higher than the rent of the old dormitories. Workers are unwilling to move in because they cannot afford the rent. There are many similar examples in various regions. This practice is obviously contrary to the policy of concentrating efforts on key construction projects. This is a serious violation of the national financial system and a crime against the country and the people.

    One source of waste in construction is the formalistic and retro architectural thinking among some of our architects. Many architects are unwilling to engage in standard design in their designs, considering it to be "third-rate" work. They want to engage in independent design, and want to design large buildings and luxurious buildings. They often develop tendencies of "revivalism" and "aestheticism" under the pretext of opposing "structuralism" and "inheriting the heritage of classical architecture." They take "palaces," "temples," "memorial arches," and "pagodas" of the feudal era as blueprints, and use a large number of expensive pavilions, painted beams and carved pillars, gilded lacquer, large roofs, and stone lion forms in the construction, and use a lot of manual labor to depict various ancient colored paintings and make various exaggerated decorations. The cost of decoration in some buildings accounts for 30% of the total cost. These buildings not only consume a lot of money, but also generally hinder practicality; because a large number of manual operations are used, it is impossible to adopt industrialized construction methods, which also delays the progress of construction.

    As for the waste in construction, it is also very serious. Many projects have brought many difficulties to construction due to the high design standards, the complex materials used, the unique structure, the large number of types of doors and windows, and the excessive ornamentation, resulting in an increase in rework accidents and causing a lot of waste. There are also many construction projects where the construction units are poorly managed, the consumption of raw materials and labor is very high, and the quality of the project is not high, resulting in serious waste. In Beijing, many buildings have just been built and cracks in beams and columns, honeycomb pitting in concrete products, loose doors and windows, blocked water pipes, poor ventilation, and peeling ceilings have been found; even during the construction process, various accidents as mentioned above have been found in some projects that have not yet been completed. Due to the low quality of construction, a lot of money has to be spent every year for maintenance after completion, resulting in a long-term waste. This phenomenon must be quickly changed resolutely.

    The tendency of not paying attention to economy in construction should first be the responsibility of the relevant leading organs. Many agencies and enterprises engaged in construction have serious departmentalism, lack a sense of financial discipline, and do not recognize the importance of saving every penny to support industrial construction. Therefore, they do not cherish state funds and have developed serious extravagance and waste. Secondly, the construction leading organs have not promptly raised this issue for criticism and correction. Leading cadres of the Central Design Institute and the Beijing Design Institute have also failed to devote their main efforts to studying economic issues in design. Some buildings designed by the Central Design Institute and the Beijing Design Institute, such as the Di'anmen Dormitory and the New Beijing Hotel, have serious waste to varying degrees. Here, the Architectural Society must also be mentioned. In the two issues of the Architectural Journal published by the society, people cannot find articles that care about economic issues in construction. On the contrary, they can find many articles that promote erroneous architectural ideas, and even publish papers and design drawings with serious waste and formalistic tendencies. Finally, the state's financial and supervisory authorities have not resolutely carried out a relentless and effective struggle against this waste phenomenon, which is also one of the reasons for the spread of waste.

    Our country is mobilizing forces from all sides to strive to complete the first five-year plan for socialist construction. The Party and the government have repeatedly called on us to practice thrift and oppose waste in order to ensure the victory of our country's industrial construction. This is a common task for the people of the whole country, and it is a discipline that all state workers must observe in their work. Therefore, the tendency to ignore economic principles in construction must be overcome quickly, so that the construction industry truly conforms to the national plan, and uses limited financial and material resources in the most rational and effective way to serve economic construction and the people's material and cultural life.

    反对建筑中的浪费现象
    在我国社会主义建设的计划中，修建办公楼、宿舍、学校、医院和工业建设的其它附属建筑，占着一个相当重要的地位。几年来，在以上各方面，全国修建了数千万平方公尺的各种建筑，仅一九五三年，国家直接投资建设的房屋面积即达三千万平方公尺以上，其中住宅约一千二百万平方公尺。建筑事业的这种繁荣景象，中国历史上任何一个时代都不曾有过。只有在人民的中国，由于党和人民政府对人民文化和物质生活的高度关怀，才可能把这些建筑列入国家的计划，成为国家建设计划的一个重要组成部分，并且以这样巨大的规模进行这些建筑。但是正因为这样，所以这些建筑也就应该服从国家建设的要求，而不应该离开国家计划的轨道，离开国家的经济利益和人民的实际需要。
    国家对建筑的要求是什么呢？建筑的原则，党和政府早就指出了。这就是一切建筑都应该做到适用、经济并在可能条件下注意美观。适用就是要服从国家和人民的需要，这永远是建筑中头等重要的问题。比如，工厂中的附属建筑，一定要满足生产的要求，便利于生产和工作；学校必须便利于学习；医院必须便于医疗和病人使用。如果不是这样，建筑便会失去存在的价值。经济就是要服从当前国家的财力和人民的生活水平，要最大限度合理地、节省地使用国家的投资，要用少数的钱盖更多的房子，以便更多地满足国家和人民的需要。建筑中不顾经济效果，追求富丽堂皇的做法，就是违背这个原则，就是损害社会主义建设的利益。建筑的美观当然也是重要的，我们决不否认建筑艺术而提倡丑陋，但是除了少数以满足艺术要求为主要目的的特殊建筑以外，建筑的美观一般地决不应当违反适用和经济的原则。美观而不适用，就是为次要的利益而牺牲主要的利益；美观而不经济，那不但是浪费了国家的财力，而且往往使需要住房子的人因为费用太高而住不起，其结果也就不能算作适用了。
    当前建筑中的主要错误倾向是什么呢？就是不重视建筑的经济原则。目前我们正紧张地进行着工业建设，国家的资金和人民的收入都有限，必须竭力提倡节约，反对浪费。在建筑中只追求铺张豪华而不讲究经济，使本来可以少用的钱多用了，本来可以多建造的房舍少建了，这种作法既脱离了人民的生活现实，又违背了集中一切财力物力首先进行工业建设的国家建设方针，这是决不能容许的。因此，必须要求一切建筑单位、管理建筑的部门、设计机关和建筑师在进行设计和建筑时，时刻关心每一平方公尺的造价，采用先进的技术，加快建筑的进度，降低建筑的成本，并在这个条件下创造既适用又美观的建筑形象。
    目前建筑中浪费的表现之一，就是有些机关和企业，不分轻重缓急，盲目建筑，使许多可建可不建的建了，许多不必多建或大建的也多建或大建了，结果占用了国家大批资金，浪费了许多人力物力。西北的一个疗养所，只有三十个床位，却占用近六千平方公尺的建筑面积，去疗养的人不多，利用率非常低。北京市在一九五三年和一九五四年两年中盖了八十六个礼堂，有的礼堂装饰得还非常华丽。事实上，许多礼堂盖起后闲着的时候多、用着的时候少。这类建筑，为什么不可减少一些呢？即使必须修建，又为什么不可以由几个部门联合建筑共同使用呢？如果我们有计划地修建，岂不是就能节约很多资金吗？
    建筑中浪费的另一种表现，就是追求所谓“七十年近代化、一百年远景”，毫无限制地提高建筑标准，提高建筑造价。根据长春“地质宫”、哈尔滨医科大学、鞍山设计大楼等三个建筑统计，每一平方公尺的造价大都在二百四十元到三百元之间，只是这三个建筑的造价就超过国家标准七百多万元，用这笔钱可以盖八十元一平方公尺的宿舍九万多平方公尺。北京有些建筑每一平方公尺的造价也有在三百二十元以上的。齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂新盖的职工宿舍，由于建筑和设备的标准都高，房费最低的一月要十八元，最高的要四十一元，比旧宿舍的房费高二至六倍，工人因出不起房租不愿住进去。类似的例子各地区都有不少。这种作法显然是同集中力量进行重点建设的方针背道而驰的，这是严重违犯国家财政制度的行为，是对国家和人民的犯罪。
    建筑中浪费的一个来源是我们某些建筑师中间的形式主义和复古主义的建筑思想。许多建筑师在设计中不愿意从事标准设计，认为这是“三等”工作，想搞单独的设计，而且要设计大建筑、要设计豪华的建筑。他们往往在反对“结构主义”和“继承古典建筑遗产”的借口下，发展了“复古主义”
  “唯美主义”的倾向。他们拿封建时代的“宫殿”“庙宇”“牌坊”“佛塔”当蓝本，在建筑中大量采用成本昂贵的亭台楼阁、雕梁画栋、沥粉贴金、大屋顶、石狮子的形式，用大量人工描绘各种古老的彩画，制作各种虚夸的装饰。有的建筑装饰的造价竟占总造价的百分之三十。这些建筑不但耗费了大量的金钱，而且大都有碍实用；又因大量采用手工作业，无法采用工业化建筑方法，也就推迟了建筑的进度。
    至于建筑施工中的浪费，也是很严重的。有不少的工程由于设计的标准高、使用的材料复杂、结构奇特、门窗种数繁多、装饰太琐碎等，给施工带来了很多困难，以致返工事故增多，造成许多浪费。也有不少的建筑工程，由于施工单位管理不好，原材料和劳动力的耗费很大，工程质量不高，造成了严重浪费。北京市就有不少建筑，刚建筑好就发现梁柱裂纹、混凝制品有蜂窝麻面、门窗不严、水管不通、排气不良、顶皮脱落等现象；甚至还在施工过程中，就已发现有些未交工的工程发生上述各种事故。由于施工质量不高，交工后年年都得花费很多钱去维修，结果造成一种长期的浪费。这种现象必须迅速设法加以坚决的改变。
    建筑中不注意经济的倾向，首先要由有关的领导机关负责。许多兴修建筑的机关和企业有严重的本位主义思想，缺乏财政纪律观念，不认识节约每一文钱支援工业建设的重要，因而不珍惜国家资金，发展了严重的铺张浪费现象。其次是建筑领导机关没有及时提出这一问题加以批判和纠正。中央设计院、北京设计院的领导干部，也没有把主要的精力用来研究设计中的经济问题。中央设计院、北京设计院设计的某些建筑，如地安门宿舍、新北京饭店等等都在不同程度上存在着严重的浪费。在这里还必须提到建筑学会。在该会出版的两期建筑学报上，人们找不到关心建筑中经济问题的文章，相反的却可以找到许多宣传错误建筑思想的文章，甚至刊登有严重浪费和形式主义倾向的论文和设计图。最后，国家的财政机关和监察机关没有坚决地同这种浪费现象进行无情的和有效的斗争，也是使浪费现象得以蔓延的一个原因。
    我国正在动员各方面力量，全力为完成社会主义建设的第一个五年计划而奋斗。党和政府一再号召我们为保证我国工业建设的胜利，必须厉行节约，反对浪费。这是全国人民共同的任务，这是一切国家工作人员在工作中必须遵守的纪律。因此建筑中忽视经济原则的倾向必须迅速克服，使建筑事业真正符合国家的计划，用有限的财力物力最合理地最有效地为经济建设和人民的物质、文化生活服务。
