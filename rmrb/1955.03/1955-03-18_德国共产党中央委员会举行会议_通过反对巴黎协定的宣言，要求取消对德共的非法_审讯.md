Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 17th: According to a DPA dispatch from Dusseldorf: The Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its 19th session on the 12th and 13th of March. The meeting heard a report by Hermann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, on "The People's Resistance Movement Against the Implementation of the Paris Accords and the Tasks of the Party," and passed two resolutions: "Declaration Against the Paris Accords" and "Regarding the West German Federal Constitutional Court's Trial of the German Communist Party."

The Declaration Against the Paris Accords points out that the mass movement of the German people against the revival of militarism is reaching an unprecedented scale, and the German people will never recognize the resolutions of the Federal Parliament. The declaration also points out that the struggle against the Paris Accords should continue with greater force, that is, to launch a people's vote movement on a larger scale, stop conscription, protect youth, defend the people's freedom and democratic rights, and fight to improve the living conditions of the working people.

The declaration calls for the establishment and strengthening of the united action of the working class, and to unite all anti-militarists among peasants, intellectuals, and the middle class, to respond to the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to hold a people's vote throughout Germany, and to strive for free all-German elections in 1955.

The resolution regarding the illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party points out that the Adenauer government's "trial" of the German Communist Party is aimed at strengthening the rule of monopoly capital and militarism, at crushing the people's resistance movement against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Accords, and is an attack on the people's democratic rights and the will to peacefully unify Germany. Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate government declared that it would ban eighteen democratic groups, which is the first move after the reactionary majority of the Federal Parliament ratified the Paris Accords. The resolution calls on the broad masses of the West German people to strengthen the protest movement, in factories and trade unions, at mass rallies and various gatherings, to demand the cancellation of the "trial" of the German Communist Party.

    德国共产党中央委员会举行会议
    通过反对巴黎协定的宣言，要求取消对德共的非法“审讯”
    【新华社柏林十七日电】据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国共产党中央委员会在十二日和十三日举行第十九次会议。会议由德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼作关于“反对实施巴黎协定的人民抵抗运动和党的任务”的报告，并且通过了“反对巴黎协定宣言”和“关于西德联邦宪法法院对德国共产党的审讯”两项决议。
    反对巴黎协定的宣言指出，德国人民反对军国主义复活的群众运动正达到空前未有的规模，德国人民决不承认联邦议院的决议。宣言同时也指出，反对巴黎协定的斗争应以更大的力量继续进行，这就是说，要以更大的规模展开人民投票运动、阻止征兵、保护青年、捍卫人民的自由和民主权利，并且为改善劳动人民生活条件而斗争。
    宣言号召建立和加强工人阶级的统一行动，并且在农民、知识分子和中产阶层中联合一切反对军国主义的人们，响应德意志民主共和国人民议院关于在全德境内举行人民投票的建议，努力争取在一九五五年举行全德自由选举。
    在关于非法“审讯”德国共产党的决议中指出，阿登纳政府“审讯”德国共产党是为了加强独占资本和军国主义的统治，是为了要击破反对批准和实施巴黎协定的人民抵抗运动，是对人民的民主权利和要求和平统一德国的意志的进攻。最近，莱因—伐尔兹州政府声言将取缔十八个民主团体，就是联邦议院反动多数批准巴黎协定后的第一个举动。决议号召西德广大人民加强抗议运动，在工厂和工会中，在群众大会和各种集会上，要求取消对德国共产党的“审讯”。
