The locally state-owned Shantou Flour Mill, which began construction in November of last year, started production on February 14. The factory's equipment was converted from old machines from thirty years ago. After the conversion, the machine's production capacity increased from more than 40 bags of flour per hour to about 75 bags. After starting production, the machine is running normally, the flour yield reached 81.5 percent, and each hundred catties of wheat produced six more catties of flour than the mills. It is estimated that the processing fee is half the price of the mills, and the quality of the flour is much higher.

    汕头面粉厂开工生产
    去年十一月动工兴建的地方国营汕头面粉厂，二月十四日已经开工生产。该厂的设备是三十年前的残旧机器改装成的。改装后的机器，生产能力已由每小时产面粉四十多袋提高到七十五袋左右。开工生产后，机器运转正常，出粉率达到百分之八十一点五，每百斤小麦比磨坊多出六斤面粉，加工费估计比磨坊便宜一半，而且面粉的质量还要高得多。
