Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: China's railway departments are carrying out various preparations for international joint transportation via the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Ministry of Railways has established a Jining-Erlian Railway Joint Transportation Preparatory Committee to supervise and inspect the preparatory work of relevant units and ensure the realization of international joint transportation within the year.

The railway tracks of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic are slightly wider than China's standard gauge. Therefore, the tracks of the Jining-Erlian line will be widened accordingly, and a special mechanical transfer device will be installed at Jining Station. These tasks are being actively prepared. Many station building constructions, signaling, water supply equipment, and locomotive depot equipment, which must be completed before joint transportation, are being built at an accelerated pace. Currently, tens of thousands of workers are working intensively along the Jining-Erlian line every day. Domestic locomotive and rolling stock repair factories are also modifying a batch of locomotives and vehicles specifically for the Jining-Erlian line to operate on wide-gauge railways.

The management agency for the Jining-Erlian line, the Jining Transportation Sub-bureau, is also about to be formally established, and the staff required by the Transportation Sub-bureau has begun to be transferred.

    集二线联运筹备委员会成立
    【新华社二十四日讯】我国铁路部门正在进行经由集宁—乌兰巴托铁路和苏、蒙两国实行国际联运的各项准备工作。铁道部已经成立了一个集二线联运筹备委员会，专门督促检查各有关单位的筹备工作，保证年内实现国际联运。
    苏联和蒙古人民共和国铁路的路轨较我国标准轨稍宽，所以集二线的路轨将相应地放宽，集宁车站也要设置一种特殊的机械换装设备。这些工作都在积极准备。联运前必须完成的许多站场房屋建筑、信号、给水设备、机务段设备等都在加紧修建，现在集二线沿线每天都有上万工人在紧张地工作。国内机车车辆修理工厂也在改装一批专门供给集二线在宽轨铁路运行的机车和车辆。
    集二线的管理机构——集宁运输分局也快要正式成立，运输分局所需要的工作人员已经开始调集。
