    We Must Master Atomic Energy
    Qian Weichang, Provost of Tsinghua University
    The Soviet government has decided to share the achievements of Soviet scientists' collective labor – the experience of peaceful uses of atomic energy – with all peace-loving countries in the world. It has also decided to provide extensive assistance to our country in science, technology, and industry, establishing scientific experimental centers to develop research in nuclear physics and the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. This decision is sincerely appreciated by the Chinese people and provides tremendous encouragement to Chinese scientists. The atomic age has finally arrived. Atomic energy will have a huge and profound impact on our country’s ongoing large-scale economic construction. Chinese scientists love their country and love peace. With the shining example of Soviet scientists, we will surely be able to quickly master the technology of peaceful utilization of atomic energy, engage in peaceful construction for the motherland, and bring a happier and more prosperous future to the people. This is the historical task of scientists in New China.
    The discovery of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, just like humanity's discovery of fire and the application of electricity, will leapfrog humanity's productivity, promote large-scale industrial transformation, and provide more superior and richer conditions for people's material and cultural life.
    The development of atomic energy will first have a huge impact on our country's power production planning. In all industrial construction, one of the first considerations is the source of power. Hydroelectric power generation generally requires a long construction period, huge investment, and is restricted by certain geographical conditions. Thermal power generation must consider the source, supply, transportation, and storage of coal everywhere. For example, in the Shanghai area of our country, there is no water power and it is far from the coal mining area, so power construction is relatively expensive. Atomic power plants are not restricted by the geographical conditions of fuel supply. Its development will make it possible for us to completely ignore the source of power in economic construction planning. This will make it possible for our country's industry to be dispersed, and it will make it possible for our country to develop industry in deserts, mountains, grasslands, and remote islands.
    The cost of atomic power plants in basic construction is lower than that of hydropower plants, and the cost of operation is lower than that of thermal power plants. Therefore, atomic power plants will supply us with a large amount of cheap electricity. This electricity will greatly promote the level of electrification in our industry and civilian use. In the past, some metallurgical and chemical industries were often limited by electricity costs, resulting in expensive finished products and a lack of good development. When a large amount of atomic energy power is put into production, these industries will be rapidly developed and utilized. Many precious metals can be obtained from the electrolysis of seawater. The urban heating problem in North and Northeast China will not require coal and briquettes. This will solve the annual large-scale allocation and transportation problems of coal companies, and it will also solve the winter garbage problem and coal gas poisoning problem of local governments once and for all. Our northern cities will no longer see those strange and towering chimneys. This will also solve the public health problems of industrial cities.
    The development of atomic energy will also have a profound impact on our transportation industry. At present, huge transportation power is used to solve the industrial coal problem. Coal transportation is often one of the main purposes of developing railway transportation. If atomic energy is developed, the coal transportation problem will be greatly reduced. Railway transportation will provide more power to solve the problems of building materials, industrial products, and human transportation. The trains themselves will inevitably abandon the method of burning coal, which can greatly improve the efficiency of railway transportation management. Ship power will also gradually be replaced by atomic power. This will accelerate the operation of ships and increase the throughput of docks. On the other hand, it will greatly improve the working conditions of ship power.
    Atomic energy power will enable us to create some new means of transportation because atomic energy power does not require oxygen to burn. This will truly make it possible for mankind to conquer the high altitude, and even conquer the earth's gravity.
    The use of petroleum has brought us automobiles. The application of atomic energy power will surely bring mankind a more convenient means of transportation. It can not only travel long distances, but also overcome mountain and water barriers. Perhaps this will solve the problem of petroleum resources for mankind.
    With atomic energy, the era of petroleum and coal as the main fuels will end. Petroleum and coal are very valuable raw materials for the chemical industry, which have always been consumed by humans as fuel. From petroleum and coal, we can manufacture various chemical drugs, such as various pigments, medicines, industrial plastics, etc.
    The great power of atomic energy will enable us to develop large areas of deserts and mountains, and will enable us to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction more quickly.
    The construction of atomic energy also requires us to establish many new metallurgical and new chemical industries. Our machinery manufacturing industry must also make some necessary transformations.
    The by-products of atomic piles – radioactive isotopes – will bring new and effective tools to our industrial technology, medical and health, agriculture, animal husbandry and scientific research. These tools will not only improve our technical level, but also promote our production efficiency.
    Atomic energy will have a profound effect on all aspects of China's socialist economic construction. Therefore, it is necessary to master the technology of atomic energy quickly. The sooner we master it and the sooner we develop it, the more beneficial it will be to our country's construction.
    We have full conditions to master atomic energy quickly. First of all, our country is an advanced socialist country, and the government gives great care to the development of science. Secondly, our country is vast and rich in resources, and has all the material resources for developing atomic energy. The development of atomic energy power requires a relatively new industrial base. The construction of atomic energy power stations requires many uncommon metal materials and non-metal materials, some of which are relatively rare in the world. A country with a small area cannot have these materials on its own. However, our country has a vast area and contains all the materials needed. This gives our country a good material basis for building atomic power stations. However, even with the above conditions, atomic energy is still impossible to master without technology. We thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their generous and selfless assistance. This comprehensive assistance enables us to have the most important conditions to quickly master the technology of atomic energy.
    We scientists of New China enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party and the motherland. We will surely concentrate our strength, strengthen our scientific ranks, and actively use valuable scientific achievements to promote the construction of the motherland, defend our peaceful labor, and maintain Asian and world peace.

    我们一定要掌握原子能
    清华大学教务长　钱伟长
    苏联政府决定把苏联科学家们集体劳动的成果——原子能和平利用的经验，传播给全世界爱好和平的国家，并决定在科学技术和工业上，对我国提供广泛的帮助，建立科学实验中心，以发展对原子核物理学和原子能和平利用方面的研究。这一决定，受到中国人民由衷的感谢，并使中国科学家们获得莫大的鼓舞力量。原子能的时代终于到来了。原子能将对我国正在进行的大规模经济建设，发生巨大的和深刻的影响。中国科学家是热爱祖国的，是热爱和平的。有着苏联科学家的光辉榜样，我们一定能迅速地掌握和平利用原子能的技术，为祖国进行和平建设，给人民带来更幸福更繁荣的未来。这是新中国科学家的历史任务。
    原子能的和平利用的发现，正如人类发现火和发现电力的运用一样，它将使人类的生产力飞跃地提高，促成大规模的工业改造，为人类物质文化生活提供更优越更丰美的条件。
    原子能的发展，首先将在我国的动力生产规划上，发生巨大的影响。在一切工业建设里，首先考虑的问题之一就是动力的来源问题。水力发电在基本建设方面一般是需时较久，耗资巨大，而且受到
  一定的地理条件限制的。火力发电在原料方面处处得考虑煤的来源供应和运输贮藏问题。譬如我国上海一带，既无水力，离煤矿区又远，动力建设就是比较昂贵的。原子能发电站不受燃料供应的地理条件的限制，它的发展，将使我们有可能在经济建设的规划方面，完全不考虑动力的来源问题，将使我国工业有分散的可能，将使我国不论在沙漠、山区、草原、荒岛都有发展工业的可能。
    原子能发电站在基本建设方面的费用比水电站低，在经营方面的费用比火力发电站低。因此，原子能发电站将供给我们大量的廉价的电力，这些电力将大大地促进我国工业和民用的电气化的水平。有些冶金工业和化学工业在过去常常因为限于电力费用，以致成品昂贵，得不到很好的发展。当大量的原子能电力投入生产时，这些工业就会得到迅速的发展和利用。许多贵重的金属都可以从电解海水来获得了。我国华北、东北地区的城市供暖问题，将无需借助于煤和煤球。这样就解决了煤业公司每年大量的调拨运输问题，也一劳永逸地解决了各地政府的冬季垃圾问题和煤气中毒问题。我们北方地区的城市，将再也看不见那些古怪林立的烟囱了。这样也解决了工业城市的公共卫生问题。
    原子能的发展对我们的交通运输业，也将发生深刻的影响。在目前，巨大的运输力量是用来解决工业用煤的。煤的运输常常是发展铁路交通的主要目的之一。如果原子能发展以后，煤的运输问题将大大减少。铁路运输将提供更多的力量来解决建筑材料、工业成品以及人的交通问题。火车本身也必然会放弃烧煤的办法，这样就可以大大地提高铁路的运输管理效率。船舶的动力也一定会逐步改用原子能动力。这样一方面就会加速船舶的运行量，增加码头的吐纳量，另一方面，也会大大地改进船舶动力的劳动条件。
    原子能动力将使我们有条件创造一些新的交通工具，因为原子能动力是不需要氧气来燃烧的，这就使人类真正有可能征服高空，甚至于征服地球的引力。
    石油的使用给我们带来了汽车，原子能动力的应用一定会给人类带来一种更方便的交通工具，它不仅可以远行，还可以克服山阻水隔。也许就这样给人类解决了石油资源的问题。
    有了原子能以后，石油和煤作为主要燃料的时代就会终止。石油和煤是非常宝贵的化学工业的原料，在以往是一直为人类作为燃料来消耗的。从石油和煤里面，我们可以制造各种化学药品，如各种颜料、药品、工艺塑料等。
    原子能的巨大威力，将使我们有可能开发大片的沙漠、山区，将使我们能更迅速地进行大规模的水利建设。
    原子能的建设，同样也要求我们建立许多新的冶金和新的化学工业。我们的机械制造工业也要作一些必要的改造。
    原子堆的副产品——放射性同位素，将给我们的工业技术、医药卫生、农业、畜牧业和科学研究工作带来新的有效的工具。这种工具不仅将提高我们的技术水平，并且将促进我们的生产效率。
    原子能对我国社会主义经济建设的各方面，都将发生深刻的作用。因此，迅速地掌握原子能的技术是非常必要的。愈早掌握它，愈早发展它，则对我们的祖国建设愈加有利。
    我们有充分的条件来迅速地掌握原子能。首先我国是先进的社会主义类型的国家，政府对科学事业的发展给予了极大的关怀。其次，我国地大物博，具备着一切发展原子能的物质资源。原子能动力的发展，需要一个较新的工业基础，原子能动力站的建设，需要许多不常用的金属材料和非金属材料，有些材料在世界各地是比较稀有的。一个地区狭小的国家，就不可能自己具备这些材料。但是，我国地区辽阔，蕴藏着一切需用的材料。这就使我国建设原子能发电站有了很好的物质基础。但是，光有上述条件，如果没有技术，那原子能还是不可能掌握的。我们感谢苏联政府和苏联人民慷慨的无私的援助。这种全面的援助，使我们具备了最重要的条件来迅速掌握原子能的技术。
    我们新中国的科学家，热烈响应党和祖国的号召，一定集中我们的力量，壮大我们的科学队伍，积极利用珍贵的科学成果来促进祖国的建设，保卫我们的和平劳动，维护亚洲的与世界的和平。
