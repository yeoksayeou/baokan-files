Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: A dispatch from Washington by the Associated Press on the 11th reveals that the United States is compelling Egypt to abandon its policy of opposing the Turkish-Iraqi military pact.

The dispatch, citing "authoritative sources" in Washington, stated that the "first major task" of the new US Ambassador to Egypt, Byroade, is to try to persuade Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser to abandon his opposition to the Turkish-Iraqi pact. The message indicates that Byroade is employing both threats and enticements to force the Egyptian government to submit to the will of the United States. The message said that Byroade openly stated in a recent meeting with Nasser that "the United States has no intention of rescinding its support for the Turkish-Iraqi alliance and any measures that may realize the expansion of this alliance." At the same time, Byroade also made it clear to Nasser that if Egypt changes its attitude towards the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty, the United States will "provide military assistance to Egypt's plans to strengthen its defense forces."

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: TASS, Beirut, March 15th: News from Damascus indicates that Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali held a lengthy meeting with the US Ambassador on March 14th.

According to the Lebanese "Al-Hayat" newspaper, the US Ambassador also handed al-Asali a note expressing the hope that Syria would abandon its policy of opposing the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and join the treaty in the near future. The note emphasized that the United States is willing to provide financial and military "assistance" as long as the new military organization of Arab countries is willing to cooperate with the contracting parties of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.

Shortly thereafter, the Turkish Chargé d'affaires, during his meeting with al-Asali, handed the Prime Minister the full text of the Turkish government's statement on the same issue.

In a commentary on these two meetings, the Lebanese "Al-Telegraph" stated that the United States and Turkey "continue to exert pressure on Syria to make it join the Turkish-Iraqi treaty."

    美国对埃及叙利亚施加压力
    【新华社十六日讯】从合众社十一日从华盛顿发出的一条消息中可以看出，美国正在逼迫埃及放弃反对土耳其—伊拉克军事条约的政策。
    这条消息援引华盛顿的“权威人士”的话说，新任美国驻埃及大使拜娄德的“第一个主要任务”是设法说服埃及总理纳赛尔放弃对土耳其—伊拉克条约的反对。消息表明，拜娄德为了逼迫埃及政府屈从美国的意志而正在采取威胁和利诱手段。消息说，拜娄德最近在同纳赛尔举行的会谈中公开表示，“美国不打算撤消它对土耳其—伊拉克联盟以及可能实现的任何扩大这个联盟的措施的支持”。同时，拜娄德还向纳赛尔表明，如果埃及改变反对土耳其—伊拉克军事条约的态度，美国将“对埃及加强防务力量的计划给予军事援助”。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特十五日讯：大马士革来的消息说，叙利亚总理阿萨里在三月十四日和美国大使举行了一次长久的会谈。
    据黎巴嫩“明星日报”报道，美国大使又交给阿萨里一份照会，这个照会表示希望叙利亚放弃它反对土耳其—伊拉克条约的政策，并且在最近将来加入这个条约。照会着重指出，只要阿拉伯国家的新的军事组织愿意和土耳其—伊拉克条约的缔约国合作，美国愿意提供财政和军事“援助”。
    不久以后，土耳其代办在阿萨里接见他时，把土耳其政府关于同一问题的声明全文交给这位总理。
    黎巴嫩“电讯报”在关于这两次会谈的一篇评论中说，美国和土耳其“继续对叙利亚施加压力以使它加入土耳其—伊拉克条约”。
