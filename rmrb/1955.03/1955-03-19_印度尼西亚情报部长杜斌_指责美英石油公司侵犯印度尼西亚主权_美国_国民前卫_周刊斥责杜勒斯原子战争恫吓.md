Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 18th: Indonesian Information Minister Djuanda said on the 16th that the recent statements by Standard Oil of New Jersey-New York and Shell Oil Company "violated Indonesian sovereignty." Prior to this, the two oil companies had issued statements saying they refused to refuel the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba," which was originally intended to go to China, in Indonesia.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" also said on the 17th that the attitude taken by the two oil companies on the "Aruba" oil tanker issue was provocative. It said that as an independent and autonomous country, Indonesia cannot tolerate these oil monopolists interfering in its independent policies.

The "People's Daily" pointed out that Shell Oil Company and Standard Oil of New Jersey-New York had refused to sell oil to the Indonesian Air Force during the "South Moluccas Republic" incident, while they had never refused to supply fuel to Western ships transporting munitions to certain countries, including the "Evertsen," which transported troops to Korea four years ago to massacre the Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 18th: New York dispatch: The "National Guardian" weekly published an editorial on the 14th, condemning the US ruling clique for again threatening to wage an atomic war against China. The editorial said that in his speech on his trip to the Far East, Dulles emphasized atomic warfare, and he also tried to form a common front against China by linking South Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan.

The editorial pointed out that the US blackmail will not achieve its goals. China will not yield. The previous blackmail attempts by the United States have all failed.

The editorial said that when the US Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to wage war against China, the vast majority of letters received by the White House and Congress opposed the war. The American people must loudly express their opinions again.

    指责美英石油公司侵犯印度尼西亚主权
    美国“国民前卫”周刊斥责杜勒斯原子战争恫吓
    【新华社雅加达十八日电】　印度尼西亚情报部长杜斌十六日说，新泽西—纽约美孚油公司和壳牌石油公司最近发表的声明，是“侵犯了印度尼西亚的主权”。在此以前，这两个石油公司曾经发表声明说，它们拒绝在印度尼西亚为原来准备前往中国的芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”添加燃料。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”十七日也说这两个石油公司在“阿鲁巴号”油船问题上采取的态度是挑衅性的。它说，作为独立和自主的国家，印度尼西亚不能容忍这些石油垄断资本家干预它的独立政策。
    “人民日报”指出，壳牌石油公司和新泽西—纽约美孚油公司在“南摩鹿加共和国”事件期间曾经拒绝把石油卖给印度尼西亚空军，而它们从未拒绝把燃料供给运输军火到某些国家去的西方船只，其中有四年前把军队运到朝鲜去屠杀朝鲜人民的“艾佛森号”。
    【新华社柏林十八日电】　纽约消息：“国民前卫”周刊十四日发表社论，斥责美国统治集团又在恫吓要对中国进行原子战争。社论说，杜勒斯在关于他远东之行的演说中强调原子战争，他并且努力把南朝鲜、印度支那和台湾结成一个反对中国的共同战线。
    社论指出，美国的讹诈是达不到目的的。中国是不会屈服的。美国过去进行过的历次讹诈都失败了。
    社论说，在美国国会通过授权总统可以对中国进行战争的决议时，白宫和国会接到的信件绝大多数都是反对战争的。美国人民必须大声疾呼地再度表示自己的意见。
