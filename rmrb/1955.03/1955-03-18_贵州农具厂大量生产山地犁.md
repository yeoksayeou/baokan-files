The jointly owned public-private Guizhou Farm Implement Manufacturing Factory has begun mass production of mountain plows.

The mountain plow is a new type of farm implement suitable for use in mountainous areas with abundant land. Its characteristics are that it is lightweight, nimble, easy to master, and the plowing depth can be adjusted at will. In January, the workers of the Guizhou Farm Implement Factory began various preparatory tasks for the production of mountain plows. During the trial production process, the factory widely solicited opinions from all parties to ensure that the product met the needs of farmers. Thanks to the active efforts of all the factory's workers, ten mountain plows were trial-produced according to plan on February 8th, and after several days of trial use on various types of land at the Guizhou Agricultural College farm, they proved to have good results. Farmers who visited the Agricultural College farm to observe the mountain plows in use all praised them for being lightweight and convenient.

Currently, these trial-produced mountain plows have been distributed to farm tool factories in Zunyi, Duyun, Bijie, and other places as samples. The Guizhou Farm Implement Manufacturing Factory has begun mass production according to these samples.

    贵州农具厂大量生产山地犁
    公私合营贵州农具制造厂已开始大量生产山地犁。
    山地犁是一种适于山多地带使用的新式农具。它的特点是轻巧灵便，易于掌握，犁深犁浅可以随意调节。贵州农具厂的职工们在一月份便开始为生产山地犁进行各种准备工作。在试制过程中，该厂广泛地征求各方面的意见，使产品适合农民的需要。由于全厂职工的积极努力，二月八日已按计划试制出了十部山地犁，并且在贵州农学院农场各种不同的土地上经过几天试用，证明效果良好。到农学院农场参观试用山地犁的农民，都纷纷称赞山地犁轻巧方便。
    目前，这些已经试制出的山地犁已分送到遵义、都匀、毕节等农具厂作样品。贵州农具制造厂已开始按照这种样品大量生产。
