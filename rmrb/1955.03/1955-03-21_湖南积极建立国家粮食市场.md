    Hunan Actively Establishes National Grain Markets
    In November 1954, as Hunan Province's grain unified purchase task approached completion, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed Party committees at all levels to urge grain departments to quickly restore and establish national grain markets. Currently, over 1,800 national grain markets have been established throughout the province. From December 1954 to mid-February of this year, these markets have transacted over 8.36 million jin of grain, helping more than 20,000 peasant households resolve difficulties in obtaining seeds, feed, and food rations, powerfully supporting spring plowing and production.
    This year, various localities have strengthened leadership over national grain markets. Each market is staffed with full-time cadres from the grain department, under the leadership of the local district Party committee, with specific business managed by the district grain section. In coordination with the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, various localities have publicized the nature and role of national grain markets to the broad masses of peasants. Furthermore, due to the reasonable prices, fair weights and measures, and simple procedures at the national grain markets, the broad masses of peasants are willing to come here to adjust their grain supply. In the seventh district of Xiangxiang County alone, three grain markets facilitated the adjustment of over 11,000 jin of grain for the masses within two months.

    湖南积极建立国家粮食市场
    一九五四年十一月，当湖南省粮食统购任务接近结束的时候，中共湖南省委就指示各级党委，督促粮食部门迅速恢复和建立国家粮食市场。现在，全省已经建立国家粮食市场一千八百多个。从一九五四年十二月到今年二月中旬，这些市场共成交粮食八百三十六万多斤，帮助两万多户农民解决了种籽、饲料和口粮不足的困难，有力地支持了春耕生产。
    今年各地加强了对国家粮食市场的领导，各个市场都由粮食部门配备了专职干部，受当地区委领导，具体业务由区粮食股负责管理。配合开展农业生产互助合作运动，各地向广大农民宣传了国家粮食市场的性质和作用。加以国家粮食市场上价格合理、秤斗公道、手续简便，广大农民都愿意到这里来调剂粮食。仅湘乡县第七区三个粮食市场，两个月内群众就在这里调剂了一万一千多斤粮食。
