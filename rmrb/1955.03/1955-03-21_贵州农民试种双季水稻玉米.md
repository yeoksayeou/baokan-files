Guizhou farmers in Xingyi, Anlong, Ceheng, Wangmo, Zhenfeng, and other counties in southern Guizhou are actively experimenting with double-season rice and double-season corn. The sowing of seedlings for the first season of rice is about to begin; the first season of corn has already been sown, and the early-sown seedlings are already five or six inches tall. After the Huang Yipeng mutual aid team in Nasha Township, Xingyi County, successfully experimented with double-season rice last year, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in nearby Waiyan, Wushe, and other townships are preparing to experiment this year. Pan Zhixiang, Huang Yihong, and other mutual aid teams in Nasha Township have been actively preparing rice paddies since early March in preparation for sowing. The double-season corn planted in the first and fourth districts of Wangmo County has sprouted to five or six inches in height, and the seedlings are growing vigorously. In order to support farmers in experimenting with double-season rice, the Wangmo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has sent cadres to Guangxi, Luodian, and other places to purchase more than 300 jin of improved varieties for supply.

    贵州农民试种双季水稻玉米
    贵州南部兴义、安龙、册亨、望谟、贞丰等县的农民，积极试种双季水稻和双季玉米。现第一季水稻的撒秧工作即将开始；第一季玉米已着手播种，播种早的幼苗已出土五、六寸长。兴义县纳纱乡黄以鹏互助组去年试种双季稻成功后，今年附近的歪染、乌舍等乡的农业生产合作社和互助组都准备试种。纳纱乡潘之祥、黄义洪等互助组在三月初已积极打整秧田，准备播种。望谟县一、四两区种的双季玉米已出土五、六寸长，幼苗生长茁壮。望谟县供销合作社为了支持农民试种双季水稻，特派出干部到广西、罗甸等地采购良种三百多斤供应。
