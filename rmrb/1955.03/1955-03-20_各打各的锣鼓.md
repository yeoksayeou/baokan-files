    Each Beats Their Own Drum

    To the Editor:
    On a large road in Hangzhou city, diagonally across from each other, reside two units: the Special Products Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, and the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation. However, the business connections between these two neighboring units are not so close.
    Originally, the Special Products Bureau planned to open up 19,800 mu of new-style tea gardens and restore 32,000 mu of abandoned tea gardens in 1954. It was estimated that the province would need to select and retain 20,940 dan of fine seeds, with the seed issue to be resolved by the farmers themselves. However, the Special Products Bureau's plan made no mention of how to select seeds or how to mobilize the masses.
    During the same period, in order to discover new sources of oil, the Zhejiang Provincial Oils and Fats Corporation found that tea seeds were not only rich in oil but also produced in large quantities. The company leadership decided to purchase them. However, due to the Special Products Bureau's dissuasion, the Oils and Fats Corporation did not purchase tea seeds. In the third quarter, comrades from the Special Products Bureau discovered in their inspection work in tea-producing areas that tea trees were bearing particularly many seeds, and at the same time, tea farmers wrote letters requesting the government to purchase them. After some consultation between the two units, it was decided that the Oils and Fats Corporation would purchase tea seeds.
    The tea farmers in Zhejiang have always regarded tea seeds as cheap goods, but since the Oils and Fats Corporation entrusted cooperatives to post purchasing prices, the farmers saw that a catty of tea seeds was worth three to four thousand yuan (old currency), and each household began to value the tea seeds in their tea gardens. Before the tea seeds were ripe, they rushed to pick them all before the frost descended.
    As a result, the Special Products Bureau's plan to open up and restore tea gardens fell through, because unripe tea seeds cannot germinate at all.

    各打各的锣鼓编辑同志：
    在杭州市内一条大马路的两旁，斜对面住着两个单位，住在路南的是浙江省农业厅的特产局，住在路北的是中国油脂公司浙江省公司；这两个紧邻的单位在业务的联系上却不是那末紧密。
    原来，特产局计划在一九五四年开辟新式茶园一万九千八百亩，恢复荒芜茶园三万二千亩。预计全省要选留良种二万零九百四十市担，种子问题由农民自己解决。至于如何选种，如何发动群众，特产局的计划里却只字未提。
    在同一个时期内，浙江省油脂公司为了发掘新的油源，发现茶树的种籽不仅油量丰富，而且出产也很多，公司领导方面就决定收购。但由于特产局的劝阻，油脂公司也就不收购茶籽了。第三季度，特产局的同志在茶区检查工作中发觉茶树结籽特别多，同时茶农又写信要求政府收购。这两个单位经过一番磋商以后，便决定由油脂公司收购茶籽。
    浙江地区的茶农，向来是把茶籽当着贱物看待的，可是自从油脂公司委托合作社挂牌收购以来，农民们看到一斤茶籽可值三四千元（旧币），各家各户对茶园里的茶籽宝贵起来；他们不等到茶籽成熟就争先恐后地在霜降以前抢摘光了。
    至此，特产局的开辟、恢复茶园的计划落空了。因为不成熟的茶籽根本是不能发芽的。  王爱真
