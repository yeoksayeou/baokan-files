Yunnan Province Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest of Minor Spring Crops

Minor spring crops are generally growing well in various parts of Yunnan Province. Wheat is heading, some growing over three feet tall, and golden rapeseed flowers bloom all over the fields. According to preliminary estimates, rapeseed production in Baoshan, Zhaotong, Chuxiong, and other places can be increased, with Baoshan potentially increasing by 80%. Broad beans and wheat in Qujing, Chuxiong, Baoshan, Lijiang, Mengzi, Lincang, and Kunming City are generally expected to increase by about 10%. Harvesting has already begun in areas with earlier seasons. Statistics from more than twenty counties including Huaping and Tonghai, as well as the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, show a general increase in production compared to last year. This year, the province's planting area for minor spring crops reached over 12.9 million mu, an increase of about 17% compared to last year. Due to the enthusiastic response of farmers of all ethnic groups to the state's call to increase the planting of oil crops, the rapeseed planting area has more than doubled compared to last year. To strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of minor spring crops, various localities are actively organizing the masses to combat drought, prevent animal damage, and strengthen technical guidance on harvesting, as well as preparing for procurement work.

    云南省小春作物丰收有望
    云南省各地小春作物普遍成长良好。小麦正在抽穗，有的长得三尺多高，金黄色的油菜花开遍了田野。据初步估计，保山、昭通、楚雄等地油菜均可增产，保山可增产百分之八十，曲靖、楚雄、保山、丽江、蒙自、临沧与昆明市的蚕豆、麦子一般均可增产一成左右。季节较早的地区已经开始收割。据华坪、通海等二十多个县和西双版纳傣族自治区、红河哈尼族自治区统计，普遍比去年增产。今年全省栽种小春作物面积达一千二百九十多万亩，比去年扩大了百分之十七左右。由于各族农民积极响应国家增种油料作物的号召，因而油菜种植面积比去年扩大了一倍还多。为争取小春作物全面丰收，各地正积极组织群众进行抗旱、防兽和加强收割上的技术指导，并做好收购准备工作。
