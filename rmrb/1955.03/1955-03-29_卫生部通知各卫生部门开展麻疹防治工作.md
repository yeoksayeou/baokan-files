The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China recently issued a notice to health departments in various regions, requiring them to actively carry out measles prevention and control work.

The notice pointed out: Health departments in various regions must overcome complacency, attach importance to and strengthen leadership in measles prevention and control work, vigorously organize the strength of public and private medical institutions, health and epidemic prevention institutions, and maternal and child health institutions, unite with women's federations, and formulate thorough prevention and control measures plans to control the epidemic of measles. In prevention and control, focus should be placed on areas where industrial and mining enterprises are concentrated. First, it is necessary to widely and deeply publicize the importance of preventing measles, making it known to every household, so that the masses, especially mothers and maternal and child health workers, truly understand that prevention is to delay the age of onset, so as to reduce the severity of measles and complications, and reduce the mortality rate, so as to obtain the support and assistance of the masses in prevention work. In the publicity, it is necessary to reverse the erroneous ideas of some people who believe that "sooner or later they will get measles" and "it is better to get it sooner than later." At the same time, the publicity work for the prevention of measles should be regularized in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign.

In measles epidemic areas, adult whole blood injections should be implemented through publicity. In order to prevent contact transmission, health departments should organize mobile medical treatment, home visits, and other methods to reduce and restrict children's contact, and go deep into the homes of patients to guide prevention and nursing methods.

The outpatient departments of various hospitals should also pay attention to setting up differential diagnosis rooms in order to detect measles as early as possible and reduce the chance of infection for children in the outpatient department.

The notice finally pointed out that in order to do a good job in measles prevention and control, it is hoped that health departments in various regions will formulate specific publicity outlines and earnestly conduct them in conjunction with mass organizations, especially women's federations, women workers' departments of trade unions, and the Red Cross Society.

    卫生部通知各卫生部门开展麻疹防治工作
    中华人民共和国卫生部最近向各地卫生部门发出通知：要求积极做好麻疹防治工作。
    通知指出：各地卫生部门，必须克服麻痹思想，重视和加强领导麻疹防治工作，大力组织公私立医疗机构、卫生防疫机构、妇幼卫生机构的力量，联合妇联组织，制定出周密的防治措施计划，以控制麻疹的流行。在防治中应以工矿企业集聚地为重点。首先要广泛地深入地宣传预防麻疹的重要性，做到家喻户晓，使群众特别是母亲们和妇幼工作人员切实了解预防是为了推迟发病年龄，以减轻麻疹的病势及并发症，降低病死率，以便在预防工作中取得群众的支持和协助。在宣传当中必须扭转某些人认为“迟早要得麻疹”，“晚得不如早得”等错误思想。同时应当结合爱国卫生运动使预防麻疹宣传工作经常化。
    在麻疹流行地区，应通过宣传，实行成人全血注射，为了防止接触传染，卫生部门应组织巡回医疗、往诊等办法，减少和限制儿童接触，并深入患家指导预防及护理办法。
    各医院的门诊部分，也应注意设鉴别诊疗室，以期及早发现麻疹，减少门诊病童的感染机会。
    通知最后指出，为了做好麻疹防治工作，希各地卫生部门作出具体宣传提纲，结合群众团体，尤其是妇联会、工会女工部以及红十字会等单位认真进行。
