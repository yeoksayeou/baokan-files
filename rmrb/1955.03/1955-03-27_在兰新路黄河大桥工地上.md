    At the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge Construction Site
    The Yellow River ice has melted, and all kinds of boats and sheepskin rafts used to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge are bustling with activity. In order to rush the construction of the last three bridge piers above the water surface and complete the bridge project before the July flood season, the bridge construction workers are working in three shifts, day and night.
    The three bridge piers under construction are located in the deepest and fastest-flowing part of the Yellow River, making construction extremely difficult. The bridge construction workers used three iron boats side by side to create a "floating platform," and installed a rotary pile driver collectively created by the workers on it. The steel sheet piles of the No. 4 cofferdam were driven in one day and night. In the No. 5 steel sheet pile cofferdam, the workers used small machinery and implemented a flow-line operation method, pouring more than 130 cubic meters of one section of the concrete caisson in just thirty-six hours.

    在兰新路黄河大桥工地上
    黄河冰块已经融化，建筑兰新铁路黄河大桥用的各种船只和羊皮筏子活跃起来了。修桥职工为了把最后三个桥墩抢修出水面，在七月洪水来到前修好大桥工程，正分成日夜三班施工。
    正在修筑中的三个桥墩是在黄河水最深、水流最急的地方，施工非常困难。修桥工人利用了三只铁船并排做成“浮台”，并且在上面装起了职工们集体创造的转盘打桩机，一昼夜就把四号围堰的钢钣桩插好了。在五号钢钣桩围堰里，工人们利用了小型机械，并实行了流水作业法，只在三十六个小时内，就把一百三十多方的一节混凝土沉井灌注好。
