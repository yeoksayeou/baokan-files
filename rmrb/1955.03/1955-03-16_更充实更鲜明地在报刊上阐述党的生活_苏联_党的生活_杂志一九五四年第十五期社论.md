Editor's Note: This editorial provides profound discussions on how the editorial departments of Party newspapers can establish close ties with grassroots Party organizations, how to closely integrate with daily economic construction work to report on the life of grassroots Party organizations, how Party leaders can frequently assist Party newspapers, and how to skillfully use the newspaper platform to publicize Party life. This is very helpful for improving the publicity of Party life in our Party's newspapers at all levels, and it is worthy of attention by Party committees and newspaper editorial departments in various regions.

To More Fully and Vividly Elucidate Party Life in Newspapers and Periodicals
— Editorial of the Soviet “Party Life” Magazine, Issue No. 15, 1954

To accomplish the new historical tasks of communist construction urgently requires giving play to the initiative of all Party organizations and every Communist Party member. Therefore, improving the exposition of Party life issues in newspapers and periodicals is of particular significance.

The newspaper—this is a platform. Every Party committee can use this platform to continuously consolidate its ties with the masses, with Party organizations and members, to speak directly to them, to guide the Party's work, and to solve the most important problems in economic and cultural construction.

The Party Central Committee has repeatedly instructed that all newspapers should have a Party Life column, which should appear regularly in the newspaper and should become one of the tools for Party committees at all levels to maintain regular contact with Party organizations and members. The life of our Party organizations is rich and varied. Whether it is production, education, or any other work, Party organizations are concerned, and Communist Party members play a leading role in any work, and are leaders of the masses. In the process of this creative activity, cadres are trained and tempered, their horizons are broadened, some unsuitable and other vital Party work methods are discovered, extremely rich experience is accumulated, and many new issues arise in the practice of Party building. All of this not only makes the Party Life column an important part of the newspaper, but also makes it possible to make it lively, diverse, and rich in content.

However, many newspapers have made this most important part dull, tasteless, and colorless. Some newspapers have not fulfilled their important responsibility of striving to improve the initiative of Communist Party members; not only that, but the materials they publish on Party life issues instead reduce the interest of Party members in the lively cause of the Party and in the work of the people.

Take the "Baku Worker" newspaper as an example. It is difficult to get a concept of the life of the Azerbaijan Party organization from this newspaper. The problems in the Party's organizational work and political work are hardly reflected in this newspaper. The themes of the Party Life column are extremely poor. The newspaper rarely publishes articles and correspondence on Party work issues. The quality of the published materials is also not satisfactory. There is no serious analysis of the activities of the Party organization in these materials, and no specific examples of work are put forward. Obviously, the editorial department has reduced the task of the Party Life Department only to publishing summary materials and recorded reports of those conferences, plenary sessions, and training courses.

There are thousands of grassroots Party organizations in Azerbaijan. For three months, only five secretaries of Party organizations in enterprises and collective farms have published articles on Party work issues in the newspaper. That's all. There are more than 100,000 Communist Party members in the republic, but the newspaper has not published a single letter from a Communist Party member during this period. It is unimaginable that they have nothing to write about.

If the editorial department pays attention to observing what is happening around it, it will not be difficult to find that life is rich and interesting in the Party organizations of oil fields, refineries, collective farms, and schools. Communist Party members are fighting to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they are learning, teaching others, working with non-Party masses, reading various books and newspapers, watching various dramas, and educating their children. But according to the "Baku Worker" newspaper, it seems that Communist Party members only attend meetings in the Party organization. How impoverished this makes Party life, and how much it causes Communist Party members to lose their enthusiasm for writing for their newspaper!

This newspaper also completely forgot to elaborate on the life of the Communist Youth League organization, and on the issue of the Party's leadership of the Communist Youth League.

Unfortunately, the "Baku Worker" newspaper is not the only example.

How should we explain why the Party Life columns of some newspapers have become like this? Obviously, on the one hand, it is due to the Party committee's lack of attention to this most important part of its organ newspaper, and on the other hand, it is also because the editorial department has forgotten the Party Central Committee's instructions on the nature of the exposition of Party life issues in newspapers and periodicals, and rarely considers the direction of this column.

The Party Central Committee pointed out: "The Party Life column should expand the scope of the issues explained in the newspaper, and strive to include all phenomena and forms of Party life and work, in order to serve the interests of all Party members, not just Party organ staff"; The Party Life column "should rely not only on Party organ staff, but also on the broader masses of Party members, especially grassroots Party activists." However, many editorial departments believe that it is normal for most of the articles on Party life issues to be written regularly by a few full-time authors. In this way, articles and correspondence that are no different from dull reports appear in the newspaper. The nature of these materials will never encourage ordinary Party members to sincerely write for the newspaper and boldly express their opinions.

The articles in the Party Life column should not only be aimed at organ staff and Party activists, but first of all at the broad masses of Party members, as well as those non-Party activists who surround the grassroots Party organization, who are concerned about the interests of the Party, and who are willing to join the Party. We must give the Party masses and ordinary Communist Party members the opportunity to write for the newspaper, and to write about various issues without scruples. Undoubtedly, under these conditions, the newspaper will definitely obtain interesting manuscripts on Party life issues, which can make the newspaper lively and powerful, and make it more prestigious.

The newspaper can achieve results as long as it does this. The editorial department of the Odessa Oblast "Black Sea Commune" newspaper is very concerned about strengthening ties with grassroots Party organizations, and is very concerned about making ordinary Communist Party members more actively cooperate with the Party Life Department of the newspaper. The editorial department asked Party members and secretaries of grassroots Party organizations to publish articles in the newspaper, and many people responded quickly. Communist Party members, branch committee members, and secretaries of grassroots Party organizations all wrote articles for the newspaper. The newspaper published their short articles and correspondence in the "Letters on Party Work" column. The more often this column appears in the newspaper, the more letters the grassroots Party organizations send to the editorial department.

However, it seems that the editorial department itself does not believe that these letters should become the main content of the Party Life column, and it publishes these letters in another special column instead of in the Party Life column. Some people believe that the Party Life column should only publish very formal manuscripts, not a platform for Party members to express their thoughts, put forward suggestions, and carry out criticism. This erroneous idea still exists seriously.

In order to publish more letters from Communist Party members in our newspapers in various republics, border regions, states, cities, and districts, letters that can raise new issues and reflect the vivid and direct impressions of the builders of our life; In order to make articles and correspondence arouse the interest of readers, so that they are happy to pick up a pen to express their opinions on the issues raised, the editorial department should excavate and be good at discovering the necessary materials, and be good at establishing close ties with grassroots Party organizations.

Grassroots Party organizations are our foundation. They connect the Party's leading organs with the masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Grassroots Party organizations directly guide enterprises, collective farms, and organs, and implement the Party's ideas, resolutions, and calls. Here, Communist Party members learn and are tempered in practice. Here, the vivid experience of the Party leading the masses grows and expands. Therefore, grassroots Party organizations should become the focus of the newspaper's constant attention.

It is intolerable that many newspapers deviate from daily economic construction work and dryly, rigidly, and monotonously elaborate on the activities of grassroots Party organizations.

The newspaper should use its own unique methods to help strengthen Party organizations, and help them smoothly implement the Party's resolutions. The newspaper has its own completely effective ways and methods to help the Party's grassroots cadres and influence the life of the Party organization. The question is to regularly publish such materials in the newspaper—articles and correspondence—that can teach Party organizations the art of leading the masses in detail, give vivid examples to illustrate how political work is correctly combined with economic work, and teach them to imitate and apply good work methods.

At present, when elaborating on all aspects of the Party's life, the newspaper should especially widely explain how Party organizations mobilize the working masses to fight for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, and how Communist Party members play a pioneering role in production.

The Party's materials in the newspaper should educate Communist Party members and every staff member in various ways, with an active creative spirit and principle, and with an uncompromising attitude towards various shortcomings. Our newspapers and periodicals should resolutely support everyone who puts forward principled and healthy criticism, because this criticism helps to give play to the initiative of the masses in all departments of communist construction.

Special attention should be paid to the Party organizations of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. Significant changes have taken place and are taking place in the countryside. Collective farms have expanded, the role of machine tractor stations has been enhanced, and the scale and scope of its work have expanded. The number of rural Communist Party members has increased, and the rural Party membership has now exceeded one million. The network of collective farm Party organizations has also expanded. The Party is waging a tenacious struggle to further improve agriculture. In this struggle, the experience of Party building has been enriched, and new work methods have emerged. However, some newspapers either describe the new things that have happened in rural Party organizations very little, or describe them rigidly. In many cases, the interesting and complex work of dealing with people is described too simply. Some articles often obscure grassroots Party organizations with a large number of figures, and drown out the work that grassroots Party organizations do to people. Regarding the real new atmosphere in the work, how to overcome difficulties, and how to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible and irresponsible in the leadership work of collective farms and machine tractor stations, all of these are written very little in many newspapers. Some newspapers do not patiently study the activities of rural Party organizations, but often divide these grassroots Party organizations into two categories: those with combat effectiveness and those with weak forces. The first type has achieved outstanding results in everything and can be used as an example for the other type. The second type is completely the opposite, and nothing has been done well. And why has it not been done well? What are the good experiences of those grassroots Party organizations praised by the newspaper, how were these experiences created, and how were they accumulated? Readers can mostly only rely on themselves to guess and speculate about all of this.

The editorial department should promptly comment on the most important events and phenomena in Party life. In this regard, its task is not simply to record the problems and events that the Party committee has resolved, but to promptly discover and raise new issues that have matured in practical work.

It is necessary to constantly clarify the improvement of the work of Party organs, and to clarify the specific and vivid leadership carried out by the Party committee for local grassroots organizations. It is the responsibility of the newspaper to constantly and resolutely fight against the bureaucratic and paperwork leadership methods manifested in the Party's work, to widely introduce the good experience in the work of the Party's municipal committees, district committees, machine tractor station district committee guidance groups, and grassroots Party organizations, and to boldly expose the shortcomings in their work.

To this end, it is necessary to deeply understand Party life, to maintain the closest ties with Party activists and Communist Party members, and to care about their demands.

Therefore, newspaper staff must often go to various places to study the life of Party organizations more deeply. In this regard, the editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief of the newspaper should play an exemplary role.

The newspaper must compile meeting reports with a thoughtful attitude towards the cause. The Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that conferences, activist meetings, plenary sessions, and delegate meetings must truly become broad platforms for bold and sharp criticism of shortcomings. The newspaper editorial department must follow this instruction when compiling meeting reports.

How the newspaper elaborates on Party life issues, and the tone and content of these materials, are not irrelevant to the Party committee. Therefore, Party leaders must often and specifically care about improving the work of the Party Life Department of the newspaper, and cannot completely rely on the editorial staff.

Naturally, the leadership and assistance to the newspaper cannot be limited to discussing some issues related to the newspaper's work at the Party committee meeting. Party leaders should personally and often pay attention to the content of the newspaper. As we all know, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in his busy Party and state work, also took time to write to the editor-in-chief his opinions on a certain issue of the newspaper or a certain article, suggesting that the newspaper raise a certain important issue or suggesting that they cooperate with a certain author, etc.; and he himself often published guiding articles in the newspaper.

When Party leaders provide newspapers and periodicals with constant assistance, they must also be good at using the newspaper platform, through which they can speak to the broadest strata of residents. Party staff holding leadership positions meet people every day, often go to Party organizations, and accumulate many impressions, facts, and opinions. He always has issues to talk about, and it is his responsibility to often express his opinions in the newspaper. This will set a good example for Party activists. The editorial department should absorb new authors who are constantly emerging from the ranks of Party activists.

An indispensable condition for the Party to conduct practical leadership of the newspaper is to care about carrying out self-criticism and criticism from below in the newspaper. The newspaper should most sharply expose the shortcomings in the Party's work, mobilize Communist Party members to overcome these shortcomings, and launch the broad masses of Party members to carry out healthy criticism within their own organizations.

Unfortunately, some Party committee leaders attempted to whitewash the truth. Not only did they not support the newspaper's criticism of the shortcomings in the Party's work, but they also attempted to limit these criticisms, trying to make these criticisms weak, unspecific, that is, something with little practical significance.

Comrade Yefimov, Secretary of the Leninogorsk Municipal Committee of East Kazakhstan Oblast, and Comrade Nacharov, Secretary of the Maksim District Committee of Vologda Oblast, both proposed to the newspaper editor-in-chief that critical materials should not be published without the consent of the municipal committee and district committee secretaries. Some staff members of the Vologda Oblast Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also have the same incorrect attitude. Comrade Gorachev, editor-in-chief of the Maksim District Newspaper, said in a letter to "Party Life" magazine: "Comrade Barennov, the instructor of the Oblast Committee, openly said to me that before publishing critical manuscripts, I must obtain——in his words——'approval from the District Committee before these manuscripts can be published'."

Fearing the fresh air of criticism makes it impossible to make the newspaper lively and vivid. Without elaborating on Party life issues in newspapers and periodicals in a rich, bold, and profound way, it is impossible to successfully influence and improve all of the Party's work through the newspaper.

At present, district Party congresses and municipal Party congresses are being held in various republics and states. The task of the newspaper editorial department is to use the opportunity to meet with the delegates to enhance and consolidate the editorial department's ties with Party organizations at all levels and Party activists, in order to deeply elaborate on and raise urgent issues in the Party's work, and in order to draw conclusions for their own practical activities based on the speeches and suggestions of these delegates.

### 更充实更鲜明地在报刊上阐述党的生活——苏联“党的生活”杂志一九五四年第十五期社论

专栏：

    编者按：这篇社论对于党的报刊编辑部如何同党的基层组织取得密切联系，如何密切结合日常的经济建设工作去报道党的基层组织的生活，对于党的领导者如何经常帮助机关报并善于利用报纸这个讲坛进行党的生活的宣传，都做了深刻的论述。这对于改进我们党的各级机关报关于党的生活的宣传很有帮助，值得各地党委和党报编辑部注意。
    更充实更鲜明地在报刊上阐述党的生活
    ——苏联“党的生活”杂志一九五四年第十五期社论
    为了完成新的历史性的共产主义建设任务，就迫切要求发挥一切党组织和每个共产党员的积极性。因此，改进报刊对党的生活问题的阐述，具有特殊的意义。
    报纸—这是一个讲坛，每个党委会利用这个讲坛，就有可能不断地巩固同群众、同党组织和党员的联系，直接向他们发言，指导党的工作，来解决经济和文化建设中的最重要的问题。
    党中央委员会一再指示，各报都应有党的生活栏，它应当经常在报纸上出现，并应当成为各级党委会同党组织和党员取得经常联系的工具之一。我们的党组织的生活是丰富多采的。无论是生产、教育或其他任何工作，党组织都是关心的，而共产党员在任何一项工作中都发挥着先进作用，都是群众的领导者。在这种创造性活动的过程中，培养和锻炼了干部，扩大了他们的眼界，发现了一些不合适的和另一些有着生命力的党工作的方式和方法，积累了极其丰富的经验，在党的建设实践中又产生了许多新的问题。所有这些不仅使党的生活栏成为报纸的重要部分之一，而且使它有可能办得生动多样和富有内容。
    但是，许多报纸却把这最重要的一部分弄得枯燥无味和毫无色彩。有些报纸没有履行自己为提高共产党员的积极性而斗争这一重要责任；不仅如此，它们发表的关于党的生活问题的材料，反而会使党员对生动的党的事业和对人们进行工作的兴趣降低。
    这里举“巴库工人”报为例。从这个报纸上很难对阿塞拜疆党组织的生活得出一个概念。党的组织工作和党的政治工作中的问题，在这个报纸上几乎没有反映。党的生活栏的题材极其贫乏。报纸上很少刊登有关党的工作问题的文章和通讯。已发表的材料的质量也不能令读者满意，在这些材料中对党组织的活动没有进行认真的分析，没有提出工作中的具体榜样。显而易见，编辑部把党的生活部的任务，只归结为刊登那些大会、全体会议、讲习班的总结材料和记录性的报道了。
    阿塞拜疆有几千个基层党组织。三个月来，报纸上只有五个企业和集体农庄党组织书记在报上发表过关于党的工作问题的文章。仅仅如此而已。共和国内有十万以上的共产党员，而在此期间报纸并没有刊登过一封共产党员的来信。如果说他们没有什么可写的事，那是不可想像的。
    假如编辑部注意观察一下四周所发生的事物，那么就不难发现，在采油场、炼油厂、集体农庄和学校的党组织中，生活是丰富多采和饶有趣味的。共产党员们在为提前完成第五个五年计划而斗争着，他们学习，教导别人，对非党群众进行工作，读各种书报，看各种戏剧，教育子女。而照“巴库工人报”所描述的，好像共产党员在党组织里只是参加会议而已。这是怎样把党的生活弄得贫乏不堪，并使共产党员丧失了给自己的报纸写稿的热情啊！
    这个报纸也完全没有想到阐述共青团组织的生活，阐述党对共青团的领导问题。
    遗憾的是，“巴库工人”报并不是仅有的例子。
    有些报纸党的生活栏所以会变成这个样子，应该怎样解释呢？显然，一方面是由于党委会对自己机关报的这个最重要的部分未加以注意，另一方面也由于编辑部忘记了党中央委员会关于在报刊上对党的生活问题阐述的性质的指示，很少考虑这个栏的方针。
    党中央委员会曾指出：“党的生活栏应当扩大在报纸上所说明的问题的范围，力求包括党的生活和工作的一切现象和形式，以便为全体党员、而不仅仅是为党机关工作人员的利益服务”；党的生活栏“既要依靠党机关工作人员，也要依靠更广大的党员群众，特别是基层的党积极分子”。而有许多编辑部却认为，大部分关于党的生活问题的文章，经常由几个专职的作者来执笔，是正常的现象。这样一来，就使报纸上出现了同枯燥无味的报告书毫无差别的文章和通讯。这些材料的性质，绝不会促使普通党员真诚地为报纸写稿，大胆地发表自己的意见。
      党的生活栏的文章，不仅应面向机关工作人员和党的积极分子，而且首先要面向广大的党员群众，以及那些环绕在基层党组织周围、关心着党的利益和愿意加入党的非党积极分子。必须使党的群众、普通共产党员有机会给报纸写稿，能无所顾忌地写出各种问题。无疑的，在这种条件下，报纸一定能获得关于党的生活问题的有趣稿件，这些稿件可以使报纸生动活泼，使它更有力量和更有威信。
    报纸只要这样做，就能获得成绩。敖德萨州
  “黑海公社”报编辑部很关心加强同基层党组织的联系，很关心使一般共产党员同该报党的生活部更加积极的合作。编辑部要求党员和基层党组织书记在报纸上发表文章，许多人都迅速地响应了。共产党员、支部委员和基层党组织书记都给报纸写文章。报纸把他们写的短文和通讯刊登在“关于党的工作的来信”栏内。当这一栏在报纸上出现的愈经常，基层党组织给编辑部的来信也就愈多。
    但是，看来编辑部本身还不相信这些来信应该成为党的生活栏的主要内容，它把这些来信不登在党的生活栏里，而在另外特殊的栏里发表出来。有人认为，党的生活栏应该只发表非常正式的稿件，而不是党员表达自己思想、提出建议和进行批评的讲台。这种错误的想法还是严重存在的。
    为了在我们各共和国、边疆区、州、市和区的报纸上更多地刊载共产党员的来信，刊载那些能够提出新问题、反映我们生活建设者的生动而直接的印象的来信；为了使文章和通讯能引起读者的兴趣，使他们乐于拿起笔来对提出的问题发表意见，编辑部就应该发掘和善于发现必需的材料，善于同基层党组织取得密切联系。
    基层党组织是我们的基础，它们使党的领导机关同工人、农民和知识分子群众取得联系。基层党组织直接指导着企业、集体农庄和机关，贯彻党的思想、决议和号召。在这里，共产党员在实际工作中进行学习并受到锻炼。在这里，党领导群众的生动经验成长着和扩大着。因此，基层党组织应当成为报纸经常注意的中心。
    许多报纸脱离日常的经济建设工作，而去枯燥地、呆板地和千篇一律地阐述基层党组织的活动，这种做法是不能容忍的。
    报纸应当用它本身所特有的方法来协助加强党的组织，帮助它们顺利实现党的决议。在帮助党的基层干部、影响党组织的生活方面，报纸是有它自己的完全有效的方式和方法的。问题就是要在报纸上经常刊登这样的材料——文章和通讯，这些材料能够详尽地把领导群众的艺术教给党组织，举出生动的实例来说明政治工作如何同经济工作正确地结合，并教会他们仿效和运用好的工作方法。
      目前，报纸在阐述党的各个方面的生活时，应特别广泛地说明，党组织如何动员劳动群众为提前完成五年计划而斗争，共产党员如何在生产上起先锋作用。
    报纸上有关党的材料，要用各种方法，以主动的创造精神和原则性，以及对各种缺点采取不调和态度的精神，来教育共产党员和每个工作人员。我们的报刊要坚决支持每一个提出原则性的、健康的批评的人，因为这种批评有助于在共产主义建设的各个部门发挥群众的积极性。
  　对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的党组织应当给予特别的注意。农村发生了和正在发生着显著的变化。集体农庄扩大了，机器拖拉机站的作用提高了，它的工作的规模和范围扩大了。农村共产党员的人数增加了，现在农村党员队伍已超过了百万人。集体农庄党组织网也扩大了。党为了进一步提高农业，正在进行着顽强的斗争。在这个斗争中丰富了党的建设的经验，出现了新的工作方式和方法。但有些报纸对农村党组织所发生的新事物，不是描述得很少，就是呆板地描述一番。在许多场合，把有趣而复杂的对待人的工作描述得过于简单化。有些文章往往用大量的数目字遮蔽了基层党组织，淹没了基层党组织向人们进行的工作。对于工作中真正的新气象，对于怎样克服困难，怎样在集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的领导工作中消灭了无人负责和不负责任的现象等，所有这些，在许多报纸上都写的很少很少。有一些报纸不是耐心地研究农村党组织的活动，而往往是把这些基层党组织划分为富有战斗力的和力量薄弱的两类。第一类样样都是成绩斐然，可以作为另一类的榜样。第二类则完全相反，什么都没有搞好。而为什么没有搞好呢？报纸所赞扬的那些基层党组织的好的经验又是什么，这些经验是怎样创造出来，怎样积累起来的呢？所有这些，读者大半只能靠自己去猜想和推测了。
    编辑部应当及时地对党的生活中最重要的事件和现象加以评述。在这方面，它的任务并不是简单地记述党委会已经解决了的问题和事件，而是及时发现和提出实际工作中已经成熟的新问题。
      必须经常阐明党机关工作的改进，阐明党委会对当地的基层组织所进行的具体而生动的领导。报纸的责任就是要不断地、坚决地同党的工作中所表现出来的官僚主义和文牍主义的领导方法进行斗争，广泛地介绍党的市委会、区委会、机器拖拉机站区委指导小组和基层党组织工作中的良好经验，大胆地揭发它们工作中的缺点。
    为此，就必须深入地了解党的生活，同党的积极分子、共产党员保持最密切的联系，关心他们的要求。
    因此，报纸工作人员必须经常到各地去，更深入地研究党组织的生活。在这方面，报纸的主编和副主编应该起模范作用。
    报纸必须以对事业的深思熟虑的态度来编写会议报道。第十九次党代表大会曾经指出，大会、积极分子会议，全体会议和代表会议都必须真正成为对缺点进行大胆的、尖锐的批评的广大讲坛。报纸编辑部在编写会议报道时必须遵循这个指示。
    报纸怎样阐述党的生活问题，这些材料的论调和内容如何，同党委会不是不相干的。因此，党的领导者必须经常地具体地关心改进报纸党的生活部的工作，不能完全依靠编辑人员。
    自然，对报纸的领导和帮助，不能仅限于在党委会会议上讨论同报纸工作有关的一些问题。党的领导者应当亲自经常留心报纸的内容。众所周知，弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁在他所担负的党和国家的工作那样繁忙的时候，还抽暇把自己对某期报纸或某篇文章的意见写给主编，建议报纸提出某个重要问题或建议他们同某位作者合作等等；而他自己也常在报上发表指导性的文章。
    党的领导者在给予报刊机关以经常的帮助时，也要善于利用报纸这个讲坛，通过它就能够向最广大的居民阶层讲话。担任领导职务的党工作人员，天天同人们见面，常到党的组织中去，积累了许多印象、事实和意见，他时时都有可谈的问题，而他的责任就是时常在报纸上发表意见。这将给党的积极分子树立良好的榜样。编辑部应当从党的积极分子队伍中吸收不断涌现的新的作者。
    党对报纸进行切实的领导的必不可少的条件，就是关心在报纸上开展自我批评和自下而上的批评。报纸应当最尖锐地揭发党工作中的缺点，动员共产党员来克服这些缺点，发动广大的党员群众在自己的组织内开展健康的批评。
    可惜，某些党委会的领导者企图粉饰事情的真象，不仅不支持报纸对党工作中的缺点所展开的批评，反而企图限制这些批评，想使这些批评变得软弱无力，毫不具体，即变成很少实际意义的东西。
    东哈萨克斯坦州列宁诺果尔市市委书记耶菲莫夫同志、沃洛果达州马克辛区区委书记纳查罗夫同志，都曾向报纸主编提出不经市委和区委书记同意不得刊登批评性材料。苏共沃洛果达州党委会的某些工作人员，也有同样不正确的态度。马克辛区报主编高拉切夫同志在给“党的生活”杂志的信中说：“州委会指导员巴仁诺夫同志公开对我说，批评稿件在刊登前，我一定要从区委会得到——用他的话说——‘批准，然后才能发表这些稿件’。”
    害怕批评的新鲜空气，就不可能使报纸生动活泼，不在报刊上富有内容地、大胆地和深刻地阐明党的生活问题，就不能顺利地通过报纸去影响改进党的全部工作。
    目前，在各共和国和各州正在召开区党代表会议和市党代表会议。报纸编辑部的任务，是利用同代表们见面的机会，来增强和巩固编辑部同各级党组织、党的积极分子的联系，以便深入地阐述和提出党工作中的迫切问题，以便根据这些代表的发言和建议为自己的实践活动作出结论。 （郑启民译，译文曾作删节）
