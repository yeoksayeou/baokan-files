    Our Hearts are Always Warm
    Now, the south of the motherland is already a scene of spring, while the Yumen Oilfield is still in a world of ice and snow. Here, the drilling workers move the heavy iron tools, so cold they stick to the hands, in the heavy wind and snow, their faces radiating hot air, as if it were summer.

    There is such a young man who was admitted as a drilling apprentice in August 1954, and only came to this Gobi desert in September. His name is Zhao Yilian, and he is only seventeen years old this year.

    When he first arrived, the cold became his biggest threat. When he went to the well site, he always crowded around where there was a fire.

    Cao Qi, the deputy captain of the drilling team, saw through his thoughts and told him a true story one night:

    "In the winter of 1951, we just started winter drilling. At that time, there was a young man who had just come from the countryside, and his situation was similar to yours today—he always stood on the side with his hands in his sleeves at the well site. At that time, the master workers' attitude was not as good as it is today. A driller saw this little guy's shrinking and fearful appearance and became impatient: 'Did you come here to participate in the construction of the motherland, or to sightsee? If you want to work, then work; if you don't, then go down! Don't get in the way here!' The young man's face flushed suddenly, and he felt extremely sad. He thought: Is it cold? Why aren't others cold! From then on, he cheered up, mustered his energy, and worked with everyone. Sure enough, as long as you work wholeheartedly, how can you feel the cold? Now, he still often has hot air rising from his head—do you know who this young man is? It's me!"

    Zhao Yilian remembered this story very well. Soon, he also became a busy man on the well site. On December nights, on the drilling platform where breath turned to ice, he was often seen lifting buckets filled with red thread oil, dipping a brush in it, and using an iron ruler to measure the rotating drill pipe, marking the drill depth of one meter, and then running to a corner of the drilling platform, using a "wrench" to knock on the drill pipe a few times, this was to tell the comrades below the drilling platform: "Another meter, quickly retrieve the sandstone." After a while, he was busy moving the heavy lifting tongs, slips...

    Someone asked: "Zhao Yilian, aren't you cold?" He said: "I'm still hot!—People who build socialism, their hearts are always warm!"

    我们的心永远是热的
    现在，祖国的南方已经一片春色，而玉门油矿区还在冰天雪地里。这里的钻井工人们在大风雪中搬弄着那冷到粘手的笨重的铁器，脸上冒出呼呼的热气，好像夏天一样。
    有这样一个小伙子，一九五四年八月间考上了钻井学徒工，九月间才来到这戈壁滩上。他的名字叫赵一连，今年才十七岁。
    他刚来时寒冷成为他最大的威胁。到井场上去，他老往有火的地方凑。
    井队副队长曹琪看透了他的心思，有一天晚上给他讲了一个真实的故事：
    “一九五一年冬季，咱们才开始冬季钻井。那时有一个刚从乡下来的小伙子，和你今天的情形差不多——他在井上总是袖着手站在一边。当时，老师傅们的态度可不像今天这样好。有一个司钻，看到这个小家伙那种缩头藏尾的怕冷相，就不耐烦起来：‘你是来参加祖国建设呢，还是来参观呢？你干就干，不干就下去！少在这里碍事！’这个小伙子猛一下脸上发起烧来，他难过极了。他想：天气冷么？为什么别人就不冷呢！从此以后，他打起精神，鼓足了劲，和大伙一起劳动起来。果真，只要全心全意地劳动，哪里还知道冷呢？现在他头上经常还冒热气哩——你说这个小伙子是谁？就是我自己哟。”
    赵一连把这个故事记得挺牢。很快他也成了井场上的一个忙人。十二月份的夜晚，在呵气成冰的钻台上，经常看到他一会提起盛着红色丝扣油的桶子，用刷子蘸一下，又用铁尺子在转动着的钻杆上量一下，画上钻进一公尺的记号，随即又跑到钻台的一角，用“搬手”叮叮噹噹地敲几下钻杆，这是告诉钻台下的同志：“又一公尺了，快捞砂岩”。一会儿，他又忙着去搬动那笨重的吊钳、卡瓦……。
    别人问：“赵一连，你不冷吗？”他说：“还热呢！——建设社会主义的人，心永远是热的！”
