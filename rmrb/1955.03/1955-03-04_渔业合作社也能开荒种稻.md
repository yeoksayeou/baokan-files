Fishery Cooperatives Can Also Reclaim Land to Grow Rice

Fishermen in Shanggulin Township, Huanghua County, Hebei Province, along the Bohai coast, plan to reclaim 1,000 mu of wasteland this spring to grow rice. Once this plan is realized, rice production will increase by more than 400,000 jin.

Shanggulin Township has about 14,000 mu of arable wasteland outside the northern embankment of the Duliujian River. This land is very fertile and suitable for rice cultivation. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the fishermen of the township organized a fishery production cooperative in 1952, which has now grown to 177 households. After being organized, there was surplus labor, and this year the fishermen asked the government to support them in reclaiming wasteland and planting rice paddies. After the fishery production cooperative in the township was organized, it conducted rice planting experiments with good results. In particular, the completion of the Duliujian River project in 1953 increased the depth of water storage within the port, ensuring a sufficient source of irrigation water and preventing seawater intrusion, creating favorable conditions for reclaiming rice paddies. Now the Cangxian Prefectural Water Conservancy Bureau and the Huanghua County People's Government have successively sent technical cadres to complete the topographic survey and the design of canals and water diversion culverts. They have also issued some loans to support the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, water pumps and other means of production. Now the masses in the township have organized labor to prepare for plowing, opening canals and building culverts in early March, and have made a preliminary development plan, requesting to reclaim 3,000 mu of wasteland by 1957.

    渔业合作社也能开荒种稻
    沿渤海岸的河北省黄骅县上古林乡的渔民，今春计划开荒一千亩，种植水稻，这个计划实现后，将增产水稻四十万斤以上。
    上古林乡在独流减河的北围堤以外，附近有可耕的荒地一万四千亩左右，这些地都很肥沃，适宜种稻。该乡渔民在党支部的领导下，在一九五二年组织了一个渔业生产合作社，现已发展到一百七十七户。组织起来后，劳动力有了剩余，今年渔民要求政府扶植他们开垦荒地，种植稻田。该乡渔业生产合作社组织起来后，就进行过稻田的种植试验，效果很好。特别是一九五三年独流减河工程完工，增加了港内蓄水深度，保证了充足的灌溉水源，还阻止了海水的侵袭，给开垦稻田创造了有利条件。现在沧县专署水利局和黄骅县人民政府，已先后派出技术干部，完成了地形测量和渠道、引水涵洞的设计工作。还发放了一部分贷款，扶植购置稻种、肥料、农药和抽水机等生产资料。现在该乡群众已经组织好劳动力，准备在三月初翻地开渠兴修涵洞，并初步作出发展计划，要求到一九五七年开荒三千亩。
