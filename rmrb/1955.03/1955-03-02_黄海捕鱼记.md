    Fishing in the Yellow Sea
    Gu Guangyuan
    As yellow croaker and prawns migrate from the Bohai Bay to the Yellow Sea, hundreds of state-owned fishing vessels equipped with modern equipment are becoming active on the Yellow Sea.

    In the Yellow Sea, the waters southeast of Shidao and the Dasha fishing grounds are treasure troves of fish in our motherland. They are hundreds of miles away from the mainland. Out on the fishing grounds, one can only see the surging waves of the horizon.

    Every day at dawn, the sailors climb out of the hatches in the misty morning, step onto the icy deck, use wooden sticks to knock off the frost and snow that has formed on the fishing nets and various fishing tools, then start the capstan, slowly lower the fishing nets into the sea, and begin the day's work. They make full use of the equipment and often cast and haul nets at night. The Shandong No. 67, 47, 57, and 59 fishing vessels, on one voyage to the southeast of Shidao, suddenly encountered a change in the weather. A storm lashed with cold hailstones, lifting the fishing vessels on giant waves, then dropping them sharply into the troughs. At this time, Yu Dechun, the captain of the lead ship, skillfully steered the vessel and directed the sailors to strengthen communication between the ships, finally overcoming the storm and sailing the vessel to the fishing grounds.

    Because these fishing vessels paid attention to improving production techniques, improving operating methods, and making full use of the efficiency of modern equipment, their yields have all increased. The fishing vessels of the Lüda Aquatic Products Company implemented the "four-ship flowing operation method," and many fishing vessels completed their annual fishing plans in early winter. The "three-ship flowing operation method" is also being creatively trialed on the Shandong No. 1, 3, and 101 fishing vessels of the Qingdao Aquatic Products Company. This is a cyclical operation method that utilizes one fishing vessel to set the net and two fishing vessels to tow the net, eliminating non-working time, so three ships can match the operating rate of four ships in the past. They caught more than 170 tons of fish in one voyage. In early December of last year, because they strengthened radio communication with the fishing fleet in the northwest sea, they hauled in more than 6,000 jin of plump prawns in one net. The Shandong No. 49 and 51 fishing vessels, on their way back fully loaded, sailed to the waters south of the Qianli Islands. Captain Ge Ritang analyzed the tidal currents and thought there might be fish. The fishing vessel cast its net and hauled in more than 6,500 jin of fish in one net. Several dozen fishing vessels of the Qingdao Aquatic Products Company hauled in nearly a thousand tons of fish and shrimp in one voyage.

    When the fishing boats return victorious over the wind and waves and fully loaded, how lively the docks are! The workers are busy unloading fish during the day, and still busy on the brightly lit docks at night. Trucks and large flatbed carts are constantly transporting fish and shrimp day and night. The ice-making towers rumble as they load ice onto the fishing vessels that have finished unloading fish, and dockworkers roll oil drums onto the ships one after another, refueling them. The engineers busy themselves carefully checking the machinery and signaling equipment, striving to set sail again immediately.

    In the midst of the intense fishing production, the trade union pays close attention to the cultural studies of the crew members, sending them abundant cultural nourishment. Every pair of fishing vessels of the Qingdao Aquatic Products Company subscribes to a newspaper. The Shanghai Aquatic Products Company's trade union also sent a large number of books, newspapers, and comic books to the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company's No. 212 and 213 fishing vessels, which created a new record of catching 196,000 jin of fresh fish in one voyage.

    Many sailors pay attention to learning culture and technology. The Qingdao Aquatic Products Company recruited thirty children of fishermen as crew members. They are all graduates of senior primary schools. They help and learn from the veteran sailors, improving their technical and cultural levels. Wang Qingxin, the chief mate of the Shandong No. 49 fishing vessel, had never attended school when he was young, but now he can keep a nautical log. Graduates of the East China Fisheries College, Wan Shuli, Sheng Guojun, Chen Yandong, and others, are also working as apprentice sailors on fishing vessels. The crew members learn from them how to read nautical charts and find fishing grounds. They are a vital force in reforming and improving China's fishing technology.

    黄海捕鱼记
    顾广援
    当黄花鱼和对虾从祖国渤海湾向黄海回游的时候，有着近代设备的成百艘国营渔轮，开始活跃在黄海海面上了。
    在黄海中，石岛东南海面和大沙渔场，是祖国的鱼产宝库。这里隔祖国大陆有几百里远。在渔场上向周围看去，只能望见波涛汹涌的水平线。
    每当天色黎明，水手们在朦胧的晨雾中从舱口爬出来，踏着冰滑的甲板，用木棒将渔网和各种打捞工具上结满的霜雪拍打下来，接着开动绞盘，把渔网缓缓地送下海去开始一天的作业。他们将设备充分利用起来，常常在夜里下网拉鱼。山东六十七、四十七、五十七和五十九号四艘渔轮，一次航行到石岛东南海面时，天气突然变了，暴风夹着冰冷的雨雹，渔轮被巨浪举起，接着又急剧滑下浪凹里。这时头船船长于德纯机警地驾驶着渔轮，并指挥水手们加强了前后船的联系，终于战胜了风浪，将渔轮开到渔场。
    这些渔轮因为注意了提高生产技术，改进作业方法，充分利用现代设备的效能，所以产量都提高了。旅大水产公司的渔轮，推行了“四船流水作业法”，许多渔轮在初冬就完成了全年捕鱼计划，“三船流水作业法”又在青岛水产公司的山东一号、三号和一○一号渔轮上创造性地试行着。这是利用一艘渔轮上网、两艘渔轮带网的循环作业方法，消灭了非作业时间，三条船就能顶上过去四条船的作业率。他们一次出海就捕到一百七十多吨鱼。去年十二月初，他们因为加强了和在西北海面上渔船队的电报联系，曾一网拉到肥美的对虾六千多斤。山东四十九号和五十一号渔轮，在满载返航途中，行至千里岛南海面，船长葛日堂分析潮流情况可能有鱼。渔轮下了网，一网就拉到六千五百多斤鱼。青岛水产公司四十几艘渔轮，一次出海就拉到近千吨的鱼虾。
    当战胜风浪，获得满载的渔船回来时，码头上是多么热闹啊。工人们白天忙着卸鱼，夜间还在灯火辉煌的码头上忙着。汽车、大板车日夜川流不息地搬运着鱼虾。流冰塔轰隆轰隆地向卸完鱼的渔轮装冰，码头工人一个接着一个向船上滚着油桶，紧张地上油。轮机手忙碌而又细心地检查机器和信号设备，争取马上出海。
    在紧张的捕鱼生产中，工会很注意船员们的文化学习，给他们送去丰盛的文化食粮。青岛水产公司的每对渔轮上都订了一份报纸。上海水产公司工会，还给创造一次出海捕捉十九万六千斤鲜鱼新纪录的上海水产公司的二一二和二一三号渔轮，送去了大量的书报和连环画。
    许多水手都注意学文化、学技术。青岛水产公司招收了三十个渔民的子弟当船员，他们都是高小毕业学生，他们和老水手互助互学，提高技术和文化水平。山东四十九号渔轮大副王清新，从小没上过学，如今已经能记航海日志了。华东水产专科学校的毕业学生万树立、盛国钧、陈炎东等，也都在渔轮上当实习水手，船员们向他们学习看海图、找渔场。他们是改造并提高我国捕鱼技术的生力军。
