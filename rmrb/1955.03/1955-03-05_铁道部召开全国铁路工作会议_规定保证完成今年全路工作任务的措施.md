    The Ministry of Railways Convenes National Railway Work Conference
    Measures Stipulated to Ensure Completion of This Year's National Railway Work Tasks

    [By Our Correspondent] The Ministry of Railways convened the 1955 National Railway Work Conference in February, summarizing the work of 1954 and stipulating specific measures to ensure the completion of the 1955 transportation plan and basic construction plan.

    In 1954, significant achievements were made in both the transportation and basic construction work of the entire railway system: the number of tons of goods dispatched completed 103.1 percent of the plan, and the transportation of major materials such as coal, coke, metal ore, construction materials, timber, and salt all exceeded the plan; moreover, major projects to extend the railway network and strengthen traffic capacity were completed, with more than 800 kilometers of new railway track laid. However, there were still many shortcomings in the work of 1954. For example, the quality of transportation planning was not high enough, the formulation and allocation of transportation plans were somewhat impractical, the organization of transportation was not good enough, operating order was not normal, violations of the train operation diagram occurred frequently, and phenomena such as trains with fewer cars than required, single locomotive operation, stopping outside signals, and traffic accidents were still serious, resulting in a waste of transportation capacity. Refusal to accept cars between bureaus, competition for the "18:00 point," violations of discipline, and departmentalism were very serious. The shortcomings in basic construction were mainly reflected in the lack of overall planning and long-term considerations, the pursuit of quantity, and the neglect of quality. The waste of man-hours, rework, materials, and machinery caused by poor engineering quality and poor construction management was significant.

    In 1955, the number of tons of goods dispatched throughout the railway system will increase by nearly 10 percent compared with 1954, basic construction investment will increase by 33 percent, and more than 1,000 kilometers of new railway track will be laid. In order to meet the growing demands of national construction for railway transportation, the conference focused on studying the issue of strengthening the quality of planning work. The conference emphasized that leading cadres at all levels should, with the support and assistance of local provincial and municipal planning commissions, carry out economic surveys, familiarize themselves with the production and sales of various enterprises, vigorously organize balanced transportation, organize the transportation of goods during busy periods in advance to relatively slack periods, and minimize the magnitude of transportation fluctuations between months and quarters as much as possible, and gradually reduce unreasonable transportation such as reciprocal flow, duplication, excessive distance, and insufficient distance. However, the practice of blindly advancing transportation in order to assemble the number of cars needed by moving goods that have been scheduled for the following month to this month should be opposed. The conference believed that, under the current circumstances, extra-plan transportation is unavoidable, but the penalty system must be correctly implemented to promote the improvement of planning levels.

    In order to exploit the internal potential of the railway system and complete more transportation tasks with existing technical equipment, the conference once again emphasized strengthening transportation organization work: the train operation diagram must be strictly implemented, operating order must be rectified, transportation discipline must be strictly enforced, the movement to fully load, overload, and travel 500 kilometers must be vigorously continued, and the turnover of locomotives and vehicles must be accelerated. Furthermore, accidents must be completely eliminated to ensure traffic safety.

    Regarding the basic construction work in 1955, the conference emphasized that it is necessary to start with overall planning and long-term considerations, further strengthen the planning of basic construction, and overcome blindness. It is also necessary to properly arrange the annual construction financial plan and strive for rhythmic and balanced production. This year, the state requires railway departments to vigorously reduce the cost of basic construction, which requires the widespread adoption of standardized designs, the formulation of new budget quotas, the improvement of design and construction quality, the improvement of machinery utilization, the promotion of specialized and industrialized construction methods, and the improvement of labor productivity.

    铁道部召开全国铁路工作会议
    规定保证完成今年全路工作任务的措施
    【本报讯】　铁道部在二月间召开了一九五五年全国铁路工作会议，总结了一九五四年的工作，规定了保证完成一九五五年运输计划和基本建设计划的具体措施。
    一九五四年，全路运输工作和基本建设工作都取得了很大成就：发送货物吨数完成计划百分之一百零三点一，各项主要物资的运输，如煤焦、金属矿石、矿建材料、木材、盐等，都超额完成计划；并完成了延展铁路网和加强行车能力的主要工程，新建铁路铺轨八百多公里。但是，一九五四年工作中还存在许多缺点。如运输计划工作质量不够高，运输计划的制订和分配还有些不合乎实际，运输组织工作也不够好，运行秩序不正常，违反运行图的现象不断发生，列车欠轴、单机运行、信号外停车、行车事故等现象仍严重存在，造成运输能力的浪费。各局间拒不接车、抢“十八点”、违反纪律、本位主义等现象十分严重。基本建设方面的缺点，主要表现在缺乏总体规划和长远打算，追求数量，忽视质量。因工程质量不好和施工管理不善所造成的窝工、返工以及材料、机具的浪费是很大的。
      一九五五年全路货物发送吨数比一九五四年增加将达百分之十左右，基本建设投资增加百分之三十三，新建铁路将铺轨一千多公里。为了适应国家建设对铁路运输日益增长的要求，会议着重研究了加强计划工作质量问题。会议强调各级领导干部今后要在当地省、市计划委员会的支持与协助下展开经济调查工作，熟悉各企业产销情况，大力组织平衡运输，组织运输繁忙时期的货物提前到比较清闲的时期运输，尽可能缩小月度间和季度间运输波动的幅度，逐步减少对流、重复、过远、过近等不合理运输。但要反对为了凑装车数而把已订入下月计划的货物提到本月装运的盲目提前运输的做法。会议认为在目前的情况下，计划外运输是不可免的，但必须正确执行罚款制度，以促进计划水平的提高。
    为了发挥铁路内部潜力，以现有的技术设备，完成更多的运输任务，会议再一次强调了加强运输组织工作：必须严格执行列车运行图，整顿运行秩序，严格运输纪律，继续大力开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，加速机车车辆的周转。并彻底消灭事故，保证行车安全。
    对一九五五年基本建设工作，会议强调必须从总体规划和长远打算着手，进一步加强基本建设的计划性，克服盲目性。并很好地安排全年的施工财务计划，争取有节奏地均衡生产。今年国家要求铁路部门大力降低基本建设造价，这就要求广泛采用定型设计，制订新的预算定额，提高设计和施工质量，提高机械利用率，推行专业化、工业化施工方法，提高劳动生产率。
