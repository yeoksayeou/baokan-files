Many Credit Cooperatives in Xinxiang Special District Have Not Implemented the Party's Policies
Wang Ruichen

    Rural credit cooperative organizations in Xinxiang Special District, Henan Province, have developed significantly. In 1953, the entire district had only 151 credit cooperatives; by the end of 1954, this had grown to 1,047. Of the district's 1,308 townships, 1,059 already had credit cooperatives. The number of peasant households participating in credit cooperatives reached 59.1% of the total households in the district. In 1954, the cooperatives' share capital was 8.8 times that of 1953, and deposits absorbed were 5.9 times that of 1953; various loans made were 137% of the state bank's agricultural loans during the same period. In addition to credit cooperatives, the district also had 115 credit groups. The large-scale development of credit cooperatives has played a significant role in supporting agricultural production, revitalizing the rural economy, combating usury, and promoting the agricultural collectivization movement.
    However, there are still many serious problems in the current credit cooperatives.
    Many credit cooperative directors lack a perspective of relying on poor peasants. Of the ten cooperative directors sent by Yanjin County to the second credit cooperative training class in the special district, eight had varying degrees of ideological behavior that did not rely on or even hated poor peasants. When granting loans, they would first lend to middle peasants who "had ways," and then lend to or not lend to poor peasants. Their argument was: "Middle peasants who have ways can guarantee repayment when the loan is due, while poor peasants cannot repay when the loan is due, which affects the cooperative's capital turnover." Huangzhuang Credit Cooperative in Wuzhi County stipulated that everyone, regardless of age, must join the cooperative, even nursing babies became members; it also stipulated that "loans will not be granted unless the whole family joins the cooperative, and more shares will receive larger loans, fewer shares will receive smaller loans." Poor peasant Zhang Xiaozhong, a family of five, only paid an admission fee of 2,000 old yuan due to financial difficulties and did not pay for any shares; at that time, he had no food rations and asked for a loan of 100,000 old yuan to make a living, but only received 50,000 old yuan. Middle peasant Huang Shoude, who bought more shares, asked for a loan of 400,000 old yuan to speculate in livestock trading, and received the full amount without any deductions. Within twenty days, Huang Shoude speculated in livestock trading at one market, making a huge profit of 720,000 old yuan. The director of the credit cooperative even said to the poor peasant on the spot: "See, is it okay not to buy more shares!" Liu Zexing, director of the Jiufeng Credit Cooperative in Bo'ai County, said: "I'm never interested in those poor wretches, they only take loans and don't make deposits, and they don't repay the loans when they are due. I get annoyed when I see them, I might as well break off relations with them." Once, when poor peasant Chen Zhenhuai came to borrow money for wheat seeds, not only did he not get the loan, but he was also ridiculed: "You don't buy shares and you still ask for a loan, don't you think about where to put your face!" Dongwanghe Credit Cooperative in Bo'ai County only granted loans to middle peasants and not to poor peasants. The director of the cooperative said: "Lending to middle peasants is to build relationships; middle peasants can make deposits, poor peasants cannot make deposits." Poor peasant Li Yuanfeng's mother was hit by a collapsing wall and asked for a loan to see a doctor. The director of the cooperative said to her: "You are 'the second daughter's sedan chair,' move back a bit. (meaning 'it's not your turn yet!')" Especially in disaster areas, some credit cooperative directors regarded mobilizing poor peasants to join the cooperative and supporting poor peasants as a "big burden" for the credit cooperative. Quxia Township Credit Cooperative in Wuzhi County only absorbed middle peasants into the cooperative, and ignored more than 100 poor peasant households. The cooperative cadres said: "Poor peasants are like ashes if they don't join the cooperative, they are worthless, and joining the credit cooperative won't do any good for the cooperative, but we have to take responsibility for them!" The cadres of Wuliyuan Credit Cooperative in Xiuwu County mistakenly made the decision to "absorb more middle peasants, absorb fewer poor peasants, grant fewer loans to poor peasants, and grant more loans to middle peasants"; the director of the cooperative was worried and instructed the accountant: "You have to pay attention to the situation when granting loans! (meaning: you must act in accordance with the decision of the cooperative committee)" Shangguan Township and Liangge Township Credit Cooperatives in Meng County stipulated that if a loan is not repaid within five days after the due date, the right to borrow will be suspended for three months, and if it is not repaid within three months, no loans can be obtained permanently, and interest will be added cumulatively, interest on interest. As a result, middle peasants who had ways did not borrow, and poor peasants were afraid that they would not be able to repay on time and dared not borrow, resulting in a backlog of deposits that could not be lent out. Some credit cooperative directors in Fengqiu County did not dare to lend money to support farmers in disaster areas, especially farmers in severely affected areas. When disaster-stricken farmers asked for loans, they were not supported according to their actual needs, but were dealt with by discounting the amount by 30% or 20%; or they said, "There is no money in the cooperative, wait a few days!" and politely turned them away. Doing so obviously violated the purpose of organizing credit cooperatives. The poor peasant masses said that these credit cooperatives were "rich people's cooperatives" and "house building cooperatives," and had a very distant relationship with the credit cooperatives.
    According to statistics from Jiyuan County alone, 453 landlords and rich peasants (some of whom have changed their class status) and 128 merchants had infiltrated the credit cooperatives. Some credit cooperatives even lent money to wealthy households who did not need loans, and the wealthy households used the money to lend at high interest rates. Wangzhuang Credit Cooperative in Jiyuan County lent 100,000 old yuan to Chen Shiqing, who used 90,000 old yuan to lend at high interest rates. Dingzhuang Credit Cooperative in Hui County lent 50,000 old yuan to help a wealthy farmer buy three mu of land. Weicun Credit Cooperative in Qinyang County lent 400,000 old yuan to rich peasant Zhang Guangtian, who used 900,000 old yuan to buy a courtyard from poor peasant Chen Zhanshui. A credit cooperative in Bo'ai County lent money to unscrupulous merchants to rush to buy cotton in Baishan Town, competing with the supply and marketing cooperatives and disrupting the market. Liu Xiuqi, director of Dashangzhuang Credit Cooperative in Wen County, mobilized ten rich farmers and landlords to buy shares worth 1.5 million old yuan, and praised these ten landlords and rich peasants at a mass meeting in the village, saying: "Some poor peasants are not as active in joining the cooperative as landlords and rich peasants!" Some credit cooperatives were usurped of leadership by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, embezzling, embezzling, and misappropriating public funds, and engaging in speculative activities. A credit cooperative in Bo'ai County was headed by a rich peasant element as an accountant, who asked a farmer to withdraw 400,000 old yuan of preferential savings for selling grain that had been deposited in the bank and deposit it in the credit cooperative, then transferred the money to Jiaozuo for commercial speculation. When depositors went to withdraw their money, they were never paid, consciously damaging the reputation of the credit cooperative. In addition, some credit cooperatives did not lend money to agricultural cooperatives and had disagreements with supply and marketing cooperatives. Wang Jie, director of Shunhe Street Credit Cooperative in Fengqiu County, decided with the accountant because of a dispute with the director of the supply and marketing cooperative: "Loans needed for buying things from the supply and marketing cooperative, or loans introduced by the supply and marketing cooperative, will not be granted."
    The main reason for these serious phenomena is that, in the case of the large-scale development of credit cooperatives, the credit cooperative cadres were not organized in a timely and serious manner to study policies. Many credit cooperative cadres do not yet understand the nature and tasks of credit cooperatives. When selecting credit cooperative cadres, attention was not paid to mastering the Party's policies. Therefore, credit cooperatives with serious problems must be rectified ideologically and organizationally as soon as possible. Otherwise, some credit cooperatives may deteriorate.

    新乡专区许多信用社没有贯彻党的政策
    王瑞辰
    河南省新乡专区农村信用合作组织已有很大的发展。一九五三年，全区只有信用合作社一百五十一个；一九五四年年底已发展到一千零四十七个。全区一千三百零八个乡，已经有一千零五十九个乡有了信用社。参加信用合作社的农户达全区总农户的百分之五十九点一。一九五四年合作社股金相当一九五三年的八点八倍，吸收存款相当一九五三年的五点九倍；各种放款相当国家银行同期各种农贷的百分之一百三十七。除信用社外，全区还有一百一十五个信用小组。信用社的大量发展，对支持农业生产，活跃农村经济生活，打击高利贷活动，促进农业合作化运动都起了显著的作用。
    但是，目前信用合作社中还有不少严重的问题。
    许多信用社主任缺乏依靠贫农的观点。延津县送到专区第二期信用合作训练班学习的十个社主任，就有八个有不同程度的不依靠贫农甚至仇视贫农的思想行为。他们贷款时先贷给“有办法”的中农，后贷或不贷给贫农。他们的论点是：“有办法的中农贷款到期保证能还，贫农贷款到期还不了，影响社的资金周转。”武陟县黄庄信用社规定不论大人小孩都得入社，连吃奶的小孩子也成了社员；还规定“不是全家入社不能贷款，股多多贷，股少少贷”。贫苦农民张孝忠，共五口人，因生活困难，只交了旧币两千元的入社费，没交股金；当时没有口粮，要求贷款旧币十万元跑挑糊口，却只贷到旧币五万元。多入了股的中农黄守德，为了捣卖牲口，要求贷款旧币四十万元，没折没扣全部贷到了。黄守德二十天内在一个市场上投机捣卖牲口六头，牟取暴利旧币七十二万元。信用社主任还当场对贫农说：“你看不多入股行不行啊！”博爱县酒风信用社主任刘泽兴说：“我对那些穷杆们啥时候都不感兴趣，光贷款不存款，贷款到期也不还，一看见他们我就下气了，干脆和他们断绝关系。”有一次贫农陈振怀来贷麦种款，不但没有贷到，还被讽刺说：“你不入股还要求贷款，也不想想自己的脸往那里搁！”博爱县东王河信用社光贷款给中农，不贷给贫农。社主任说：“贷给中农是为了拉关系；中农能存款，贫农不能存款。”贫农李元峰娘因为墙塌被砸着了，要求贷款看病。社主任对她说：“你是‘二姑娘的轿车’，往后退一退。（意思是说‘还挨不着你哩！’）”特别是在灾区，有些信用社主任把动员贫农入社和扶植贫苦农民看成信用社的一个“大负担”。武陟县渠下乡信用社，只吸收中农入社，对一百多户贫农采取置之不理的态度。社干部说：
  “贫农不入社算灰堆，不值什么，入了信用社对社也没啥好处，反而得对他们负一份责任哩！”修武县五里源信用社干部错误地作出“多吸收中农，少吸收贫农，贷款少贷给贫农，多贷给中农”的决定；社主任不放心，并嘱咐会计说：“贷款你可得看点情况呀！（意思是：一定要按社委会决定办事）”孟县上官乡和梁葛乡信用社规定贷款过期五天不还停止贷款权三个月，过期三个月永久不能贷款，并且要累加利息，利上加利。结果，有办法的中农不贷，贫农怕到期还不起不敢贷，积压着存款放不出去。封邱县有些信用社主任不敢贷款支持灾区农民，特别是重灾区农民。受灾农民要求贷款时，不是按照实际需要给以支持，而是采取七折八扣的办法应付出去；或者说“社里没款等几天再说！”婉言推出门去。这样做，显然违背了组织信用社的目的。贫农群众说这些信用社是“富人社”，“盖房社”，同信用社的关系很疏远。
   仅据济源一县的统计，就有四百五十三户地主富农（一部分已改变成份）、一百二十八户商人混入了信用社。有些信用社竟贷款给不需要贷款的富裕户，富裕户拿去转放高利贷。济源县王庄信用社贷给陈世清旧币十万元，陈拿旧币九万元放高利贷。辉县丁庄信用社贷款旧币五万元帮助一户富裕农民买地三亩。沁阳县魏村信用社贷给富农张光田旧币四十万元，张用旧币九十万元买了贫农陈占水的一处院子。博爱县一个信用社贷款给奸商到柏山镇抢购棉花，同供销社争购，破坏市场。温县大尚庄信用社主任刘秀琪发动十户富农地主入股旧币一百五十万元，并在全村群众大会上表扬这十户地主富农说：“有些贫农，还不如地主富农入社积极哩！”有些信用社被地主、富农、反革命分子篡夺了领导权，窃取、贪污、挪用公款，进行投机活动。博爱县一个信用社由富农分子当会计，他叫一户农民把已存入银行的售粮优待储蓄旧币四十万元取出来存入信用社，他转手拿到焦作搞商业投机，存户去取一直不付，有意识地破坏信用社的信誉。此外，还有些信用社不给农业社贷款，同供销社闹不团结。封邱县顺河街信用社主任王杰因同供销社主任闹意见，和会计决定：“凡是买供销社的东西要用的款，或供销社介绍的贷款，一律不贷。”
    发生这些严重现象的主要原因是，在信用合作社大量发展的情况下，没有及时认真地组织信用社干部学习政策。许多信用社干部还不了解信用社的性质和任务。在选拔信用社干部时，也没有注意掌握党的政策。因此，对于问题严重的信用社，必须赶快从思想上、组织上加以整顿。否则，有些信用社就可能变质。
