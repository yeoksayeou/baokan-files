What Should Enterprise Leaders Consider Regularly?
By Our Staff Reporter An Gang

When I talk with some enterprise leaders, I often ask the question: "What issues do you regularly consider in your daily work?"

Ninety percent of the answers I get are like this: "I'm thinking about the urgent things that are right in front of me, and even then, I'm not always thorough." "We are not leading production, production is leading us. We are putting out one fire just to have another one start up. All I am thinking about are some trivial matters." "At the beginning of the month, I'm thinking about plans and personnel issues. At the end of the month, I'm thinking about completing the plan." "The factory director's thoughts are inseparable from completing the month's plan."

In a word, everyone is thinking about the immediate production issues. This is undoubtedly correct, and it is a great step forward from the general leadership style that doesn't focus on production. However, strictly speaking, it is not enough. An enterprise leader should regularly consider some important and fundamental issues.

Be Mindful of National Interests at All Times

Starting from the national interest, improving labor productivity is always the basic direction for developing production. Some leaders often fail to correctly apply the principle of improving labor productivity when leading production. This year, some factories have adopted a "status quo" attitude toward the formulation of labor productivity plans, which is due to conservative thinking. The "principle" adopted by some factories in formulating labor plans is: "To generously increase each quota by 30 to 40 percent on the basis of the existing verified work hours." As a result, these factories irrationally used many more people last year. If you ask these enterprise leaders "why they do this," they may say something like "workers' technical level is not high," "plans are not accurate as a precaution," or "planning work lags behind reality," and none of these reasons can withstand criticism. There is only one reason: they have not paid attention to the issue of continuously improving labor productivity.

Accumulation is the basis for socialist expanded reproduction. From the perspective of national interests, enterprise leaders should organize all employees to comprehensively complete the plan and ensure that the state receives the profits turned over. The profits of our enterprises should be obtained through rationally improving production technology and reducing costs. However, some enterprise leaders solve the profit problem from another angle. Some rely on conservative planning, clearly able to complete 100, but only calculate it as 50. Some enterprises regard expenses that should have been spent, such as technical measures fees, training fees, welfare fees, and even wage adjustment funds, as income from cost reduction. These enterprises did not spend the money they should have, indicating that they did not do many things that should have been done, which should have been criticized. However, they moved this money to the "cost reduction" account, and thus became "exceeding the profit plan." Some rely on banks, handing over the interest paid to the bank to the state treasury, which is also counted as "completing the task of turning over to the state." Some borrow a sum from the bank to turn over. In short, although there are many tricks, the national interest is put aside, and the national interest is not considered.

From the perspective of national interests, wasting a penny is a damage to the country and the people, and is a wrong behavior. Therefore, enterprises must conscientiously implement the economic accounting system, practice strict economy, and truly achieve the greatest economic effect with the most reasonable funds. However, those who disregard national interests believe that "the family is big and the business is big, it doesn't matter if you waste a little." Factory and enterprise leaders who do not regard every penny and every piece of material as the highest interest of the country cannot truly implement economic accounting.

Consider the Development of the National Economy

The enterprise's plan is a part of the national economic plan, and it must obey the requirements of the national economic plan. This is familiar to every enterprise worker.

Last year, I went to the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company to attend a small farewell meeting for a newly repaired ship going to sea. A customer made a request to the manager: "We hope you can manufacture a new type of ship. We can place an order with the company. Will you agree?" The manager hesitated for a moment and asked, "Is it new construction or repair?" "It's new construction." "Is it all manufactured or just a part?" "It's all." The manager said: "We are willing to undertake the manufacturing work of this new product. This is difficult, but if we do it, we will inevitably further improve the production technology capabilities of our enterprise." A Soviet comrade said: "I have no doubt that the manager will agree to this request, because, for us enterprise leaders, what we often have to consider and must grasp is new things, and new products that serve the socialist cause are a part of it." Accepting a new batch of orders means that we will learn many new technologies that we don't know and even dare not think about. We will further learn from the Soviet Union in a newer and broader field, and workers and technicians will gain new technical weapons. However, to do this, we must consciously stand in the position of national interests, withstand the test of difficulties and failures, and carry out tenacious struggles.

Enterprise leaders must also care about all aspects of national life, especially the national economic life, and be ready to provide necessary and possible support to national life at any time. I met the first Soviet manager of the original Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company. He said: "Socialist enterprises should always consider developing their own potential and helping others. We must consider all aspects of national life. Leaders of huge shipbuilding enterprises like us should consider providing the country with all possible potential. When I was the manager, I started from the needs of national economic development and used various materials left over from ship repairs to manufacture two 500-ton tugboats. When the Soviet army liberated Dalian, the city was in a difficult period, the factories were in ruins, and the recovery work was very difficult, but this did not prevent us from using factory waste to make ironware utensils that the country urgently needed at that time. I heard that China has begun to build tractor factories. If the country produces 500 tractors a year, it will definitely need to use a lot of retaining rings. It is not necessary for the country to build a factory to produce retaining rings. Automobile factories can produce them, and our shipbuilding company can make retaining rings as easily as making noodles. Why can't we support the tractor factory? Our mechanical workshop has great capabilities, and the technical capabilities of our workers are higher than those of ordinary factories. We must regard these favorable conditions as the wealth of the country and use them where the country needs them most. Therefore, we must not only consider helping farmers improve plows, harrows, and animal-drawn farm implements, but also consider supplying the country's needs in manufacturing trains, airplanes, and various machines."

This is the correct view of serving the development of the national economy. Enterprise leaders should always regard the factory as the national interest and make the labor, technology, equipment, and all conditions of the enterprise contribute their greatest strength to the development of the national economy.

Think About Tomorrow

Today and tomorrow are organically linked in life. When enterprise leaders consider production issues, they should also link today and tomorrow. However, because everyone has just delved into production, they often lose sight of the other. At present, there are roughly three situations in various factories: first, today's affairs cannot be finished today, and today's problems cannot be solved today. This puts the leadership work in a passive and bureaucratic situation; second, the problems of the day can generally be considered more comprehensively, and the work of the day can be arranged in a planned manner. The third is to be able to combine the immediate work with the long-term interests of tomorrow, that is, to combine reality with vision. There are not many such factories. However, enterprise leaders must correctly solve this problem, otherwise they will never be able to get rid of the passive situation in daily work.

Some factories become nervous at the end of the month, quarter, and year, rushing to complete tasks. However, they relax at the beginning of the month, quarter, and year. Why is this? The main reason is that no preparatory work has been done for the next stage of production during the sprint. Some, in order to rush tasks, use up their reserves instead of preparing reserves for the next stage of normal production while rushing tasks. Some, in order to rush tasks, disregard everything and take on the work with large output value, with the result that the output value task is completed this month, and only the laborious and low-value leftovers are left in the next month, making it impossible for workers to earn piece-rate wages and affecting the balance of the entire production. It can be seen that to command production rhythmically, it is necessary to be good at organically linking today with tomorrow and steadily developing production forward.

Some factories often have rush tasks. These temporary tasks often cannot be controlled by planning. Some comrades, seeing this situation, emphasize that the factory's situation is special and think that "there is no way to get rid of the passive situation," so they ask for more people, overtime, and extra hours when the task is tight. However, if enterprise leaders consider the problem from a developmental point of view, they can take some fundamental measures. In the Soviet Union, one of the successful experiences of factories in solving this problem is to encourage workers to master a second skill in addition to being proficient in the technology they are responsible for. For example, if the factory mainly uses welders during the rush, it organizes other types of workers with the conditions to learn welding, so that manpower can be immediately allocated once the rush task arrives, without having to work overtime or extra hours.

Linking today with tomorrow is by no means advocating wishful thinking, but to make the leader's work today more proactive and prescient. Only by doing today's work effectively can we have tomorrow's victory. Therefore, it is very important for leaders to have a pragmatic attitude. At the same time, enterprise leaders have a long-term plan for the development of the factory, and they gradually realize the requirements of the long-term vision through daily specific work.

    企业领导者应当经常考虑些什么
    本报记者  安岗
    我同一些企业领导者谈话的时候，常常提出这样的问题：“你在日常工作中经常考虑一些什么问题”。
    得到的回答中百分之九十是这样的：“我天天想的都是那些火烧到眉毛的事情，就这样，还是想不周到”。“我们不是领导生产，是生产领导我们，扶得东来西又倒，一天想的都是一些琐碎事儿”。
  “月初想计划、人事问题，月末就是想完成计划问题”。“厂长的思想离不开完成本月计划的事”。
    一句话，大家天天想的都是眼前的生产问题，这无疑是正确的，它比那种不抓生产的一般化领导作风是大大前进了一步。可是，严格说来，这也是不够的。一个企业领导者要经常考虑一些重要的根本性的问题。
    要时刻为国家利益着想
    从国家利益出发，提高劳动生产率永远是发展生产的基本方向。有些领导者领导生产常常不能正确运用提高劳动生产率的原则。今年有些工厂对于编制劳动生产率计划采取了“维持现状”的态度，这是保守思想在作怪。有的工厂编制劳动计划的
  “原则”是：“要在现有的查定工时的基础上每项定额宽打百分之三十到四十”，所以，去年这些工厂不合理地多用了许多人。要是问这些企业领导者
  “为什么这样作”，他们可以说什么“工人技术水平不高”，“计划不准确以备万一”，“计划工作落后于实际”等，这些理由一个也经不起批判，原因只有一个：他们没有注意不断提高劳动生产率的问题。
    积累是社会主义扩大再生产的基础。从国家利益出发，企业领导者应当组织全体职工全面完成计划，保证给国家提供上缴利润。我们企业的赢利要从合理改进生产技术，降低成本中去求得的。可是有些企业领导者却是从另一个角度去解决赢利问题。有的靠保守计划，明明可以完成一百，他却只算作五十。有的企业把应当用完的费用如技术措施费，训练费，福利费，甚至调整工资基金都算作降低成本的所得。这些企业应当花的钱没有花，说明他们有许多该作的事没作，本来是要受批评的，可是他们把这笔钱挪到“降低成本”的账下，于是就成了“超额完成利润计划”。有的靠银行，把付银行的利息交给国库，这也算作“完成上缴任务”。有的找银行贷一笔款去上缴。总之，名堂虽很多，但把国家利益搁在一边，都没有考虑国家利益。
    从国家利益出发，浪费一文钱都是对国家对人民的损害，都是错误的行为。因此，要求企业必须认真实行经济核算制，厉行节约，真正作到以最合理的资金来生产最大的经济效果。可是漠视国家利益的人却认为：“家大业大，浪费点没啥。”工厂企业领导者没有把一文钱，一块材料看作是国家的最高利益，也就不能真正实行经济核算。
    要为国民经济的发展着想
    企业的计划是国民经济计划的一部分，它必须服从国民经济计划的要求。这是每一个企业工作者都熟悉的。
    去年我去中苏造船公司参加一次送别新修船出海的小会，一位订货主向经理提出一个要求：“我们希望你们制造一种新型的船，我们可以向公司订货，你们是否答应？”经理迟疑了一下问：“是新造还是修理？”“是新造。”“是全部制造还是一部分？”“是全部。”经理说：“我们愿意担负这个新产品的制造工作，这是困难的，但我们作了也就必然会更进
  一步提高我们企业的生产技术能力。”一位苏联同志说：“我毫不怀疑经理同志会答应这一请求，因为，对于我们企业领导者来说，我们脑子经常要考虑而且必须抓住的是新的事物，为社会主义事业服务的新产品就是它的一部分。”接受一批新的订货，这意味着我们将要学会很多不会的甚至连想都不敢想的新技术，就会在更新的广阔的场合内来进一步学习苏联，就会使工人技术人员获得新的技术武装。可是要这样作，就得自觉地站在国家利益的立场经受得起困难和失败的考验，并进行顽强的斗争。
    企业领导者还必须关心国家生活特别是国民经济生活的各方面，并且要随时准备给国家生活以必要的和可能的支援。我曾在原中苏造船公司遇见公司第一任苏联经理。他说：“社会主义企业永远要考虑发展本身的潜在力和帮助别人。要考虑到国家生活的一切方面。像我们这样巨大的造船企业的领导者，应当考虑为国家提供一切可能的潜力。我在担任经理这个职务时，我从国民经济发展需要出发，用修船剩下来的各种材料，制造了两艘五百吨的拖船。苏军解放大连的当时，全市正处在困难时期，工厂成了废墟，恢复工作十分困难，但这并没有阻止我们去用工厂废料来制作当时国家十分需要的铁器用具。我听到中国已经开始建设拖拉机工厂，如果国家一年出五百部拖拉机，就一定需要使用很多的涨圈。国家为生产涨圈建立一个工厂是没有必要的，汽车厂可以生产，我们造船公司制造涨圈也跟作面条一样容易，为什么我们不可以支援拖拉机厂呢？我们的机械车间能力很大，工人技术能力比一般工厂要高，我们要把这些有利条件都看作是国家的财富，把它用在国家最需要的地方。因此，我们不但要考虑帮助农民改进犁，耙和马拉农具，还要考虑供应国家在制造火车、飞机以及各种机器方面的需要。”
    这就是对为国民经济发展服务的正确看法。企业领导者永远要把工厂看作是国家利益，要使企业的劳动、技术、设备等一切条件都为国民经济的发展贡献自己最大的力量。
    要为明天着想
    今天和明天，这在生活中是有机地联系着的。企业领导者考虑生产问题时，也应当把今天和明天联系起来。可是因为大家才钻到生产中去，往往就顾此失彼。目前各厂大体上是三种情况：第一种是今天的事今天作不完，今天的问题今天解决不了。这就使领导工作陷于被动和事务主义的局面中；第二种情况，一般能较全面地考虑当天的问题，可以有计划地安排当天的工作。第三种是能够把眼前的工作同明天的也就是长远的利益，把现实同远景结合起来的。这种工厂不多。但是，企业领导者必须正确解决这个问题，否则就永远不可能摆脱日常工作中的被动局面。
    有些工厂一到月末、季末、年末就紧张起来，突击完成任务，可是，到了月初、季初和年初却又松懈下来。为什么这样呢？主要是在突击的时候没有为下一阶段生产作准备工作，有的为了赶任务就把储备量用光，而不是一面赶任务，一面准备下一段正常生产的储备量。有的为赶任务就不顾一切把产值大的活儿拿来干完，结果是本月份完成了产值任务，到了下月都剩下了费力大、产值小的尾巴活，弄得工人拿不上计件工资，影响整个生产的平衡。由此可见，指挥生产有节奏地进行，就必须善于把今天同明天有机联系，使生产稳步向前发展。
    有些工厂是经常有突击任务的。这些临时任务常常不是能用计划来控制住的，有的同志看到这种情况便强调工厂情况特殊，认为“没有办法摆脱被动局面”，于是任务一紧就要求加人，加班，加点。可是，如果企业领导者从发展的观点考虑问题，就可以采取一些根本性的办法。在苏联，工厂解决这个问题的成功经验之一就是鼓励工人除了精通本身担负的技术外，还要掌握第二种技能。譬如工厂突击时主要是用电焊工，就组织其他有条件的工种工人学习电焊，一旦突击任务到来，可以马上调配人力，而不要加班加点。
    把今天同明天联系起来，这绝不是提倡空想，而是为了使领导者今天的工作更有主动性和预见性。只有切实作好今天的工作才能有明天的胜利。因此，领导者具备实事求是的作风是十分重要的。同时企业领导者的脑子里对工厂的发展有着远景计划，他通过每天的具体工作来一步一步地实现远景的要求。
