Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th: According to Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on February 28th to all cadres, soldiers, and people participating in the Hanoi-Munankwan railway restoration project, expressing his congratulations.

    In his letter, President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that in the past, the French spent more than ten years building this railway. Today, under the people's regime, we have completed this project in only four months. This is a brilliant achievement.

    President Ho Chi Minh continued: The reason for this achievement is, on the one hand, due to the generous assistance of the People's Republic of China. Currently, China is busy completing its Five-Year Plan. Despite this, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China still sent technical experts and workers to help us. Chinese technical experts and workers are wholeheartedly helping us. The Vietnamese people are deeply moved by this lofty internationalist spirit and friendship of the Chinese people and express their deep gratitude.

    President Ho Chi Minh continued, on the other hand, this achievement is due to the creativity and hard work of our cadres, workers, youth shock brigade members, and the people.

    President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that this railway will promote the economic recovery of the Vietnamese people. It brings Vietnam closer to China, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries. It connects the capital of Vietnam with Beijing, Moscow, and other capitals all the way to Berlin. It will further strengthen the unity of the 900 million people of Vietnam and fraternal countries. This is an event of great significance.

    President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that this railway will bring great benefits to the Vietnamese people and will be very beneficial to Vietnamese business people.

    President Ho Chi Minh called on cadres, soldiers, and the people not to be complacent, but to make greater efforts to strengthen and maintain this railway.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th: According to Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, February 28th: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, received more than thirty labor models in the Hanoi-Munankwan railway restoration project on February 27th. They are representatives of tens of thousands of workers, cadres, technical experts, youth shock brigade members, and farmers who participated in the restoration project. Also received were twenty Chinese labor models who participated in the restoration project.

    Le Dung, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Transportation and Public Works of Vietnam, was present at the reception. He briefly described the achievements of the railway employees in building the Hanoi-Munankwan railway.

    President Ho Chi Minh encouraged all railway employees to recognize the importance of this railway and to maintain it regularly so that it remains in good condition.

    胡志明主席继续说，另一方面，这种成就是由于我们的干部、工人、青年突击队员和人民表现的创造性和努力的结果。
    胡志明主席指出，这条铁路将促进越南人民的经济的恢复。它使越南同中国、苏联和其他兄弟国家更加接近了。它把越南的首都同北京、莫斯科和一直到柏林的其他国家的首都连接起来了。它将进一步加强越南和兄弟国家的九亿人民的团结。这是一个具有极重大意义的事件。
    胡志明主席指出，这条铁路将为越南人民带来巨大的好处，而且将非常有利于越南的工商界人士。
    胡志明主席号召干部、战士和人民不要自满，而要作更大的努力来加固和维护这条铁路。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十八日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席二月二十七日接见了河内—睦南关铁路修复工程中的三十多位劳动模范。他们是几万名参加了修复工程的工人、干部、技术专家、青年突击队员和农民的代表。同时受接见的还有参加修复工程的二十位中国劳动模范。
    接见时，越南交通公政部副部长黎容在座。他扼要地叙述了铁路员工们在修筑河内—睦南关铁路中的成就。
