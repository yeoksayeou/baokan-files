Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 26th: TASS Washington, March 25th: U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference in Washington on the 23rd, answering questions raised by reporters. Most of the questions raised by reporters concerned the proposal by Democratic Senator George to convene a great power conference this year. It is generally known that New York political circles believe that George's views indicate the Democratic Party's attempt to capitalize on the idea of great power negotiations, which is deeply popular among the American people, in order to strengthen the position of the Democratic Party, which has been attacked by the Republican Party.

Someone asked Eisenhower for his views on Senator George's suggestion that the United States should take the initiative in holding a great power conference.

Eisenhower replied in general terms that he had stated more than once that he was willing to go to any place at any time to attend a meeting, as long as the meeting could promote world peace. However, he immediately expressed doubt as to whether the method of negotiation was appropriate, saying that international conferences serve a variety of purposes, one of which is propaganda.

In answering a question, Eisenhower vaguely said that he could make many concessions in order to ensure the successful conduct of exploratory talks with the Soviet Union. However, when reporters asked Eisenhower many specific questions about the possibility of holding a great power conference, some of Eisenhower's answers indicated that his remarks about the U.S. government believing that great power negotiations could be adopted and being willing to conduct such negotiations were purely lip service. These lip-service remarks were clearly intended to support those supporters of the Paris Agreements, so that the Paris Agreements could be approved in the French Republic Senate.

In answering a series of questions raised by reporters, Eisenhower made it clear that the U.S. government still intends to proceed from a "position of strength," that is, to hold negotiations only after the Paris Agreements are ratified.

Eisenhower said that the State Department and the President have decided that it is best not to muddy the waters before the Paris Agreements have been ratified.

One reporter mentioned that Eisenhower had previously put forward many preconditions for holding negotiations with the Soviet Union, and asked whether these conditions were still valid. The President replied that this was only put forward as an example, and there could be dozens of such conditions. The President acknowledged that he differed with Senator George on the issue of whether the Soviet Union should be required to "demonstrate its sincerity" before the meeting is convened. As everyone knows, Senator George believes that if the United States insists on the previously proposed conditions, then the United States will gain nothing.

A reporter asked whether the U.S. government was really studying the issue of holding a conference with the participation of foreign ministers, and Eisenhower gave a negative answer.

One reporter mentioned that Senator George had talked about the possibility of China participating in the conference, and asked whether Eisenhower would be willing to consider holding a meeting with China to discuss Asian issues separately or general issues together. The President avoided answering and simply said that the question was purely academic.

    艾森豪威尔的谈话表明
    美国政府无意举行大国会议
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十五日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔二十三日在华盛顿举行记者招待会；回答记者提出的问题。记者提出的问题大部分都是涉及民主党参议员乔治提出的关于在今年召开大国会议的建议。大家知道，纽约政界人士认为，乔治的意见表示民主党企图利用在美国人民中深得人心的大国谈判的主张，借以加强遭到共和党攻击的民主党的地位。
    有人问艾森豪威尔，他对参议员乔治提出的关于美国应该在举行大国会议方面采取主动的建议有什么看法。
    艾森豪威尔泛泛地回答说，他不止一次地表示过愿意在任何时间到任何地方去参加会议，只要这个会议能够促进世界和平的话。但是，他马上就对谈判这个方法是否适宜表示怀疑，他说，国际会议是具有多种目的的，其中之一就是宣传。
    在回答一个问题时，艾森豪威尔含糊其词地说，为了使同苏联举行的探讨性会谈能够成功地进行，他可以作许多让步。但是，当记者们向艾森豪威尔提出许多关于举行大国会议的可能性的具体问题时，艾森豪威尔的一些回答却表明，他关于美国政府相信可以采取大国谈判的方式和愿意进行这种谈判的说法纯粹是说说而已。这种说说而已的言论显然是为了给那些巴黎协定的支持者撑腰，以便使巴黎协定能够在法国共和国参议院中获得批准。
    艾森豪威尔在回答记者接着提出的一些问题时毫不含糊地表明，美国政府仍然打算从“实力地位”出发，即在巴黎协定批准后才举行谈判。
    艾森豪威尔说，国务院和总统已经决定，在巴黎协定还没有被批准的时候，最好不要把水搅浑。
    有一位记者提起艾森豪威尔以前曾经提出过许多关于同苏联举行谈判的先决条件，并且问道，这些条件是否还是有效的。总统回答说，这只是当作例子提出的，可以有几十种这类的条件。总统承认他同参议员乔治在下面这一问题上有不同的意见：即是否应该要求苏联在会议召开之前“表明它的诚意”。大家知道，参议员乔治认为，如果美国坚持以前提出的条件，那么美国是什么也得不到的。
    一位记者问到美国政府是否正在研究真的举行有外交部长参加的会议的问题，艾森豪威尔作了否定的回答。
    一位记者提起参议员乔治谈过中国参加会议的可能性，并且问道，艾森豪威尔是否愿意考虑同中国举行会议单独讨论亚洲问题或者一并讨论一般问题。总统避免回答，他只是说，这个问题完全是空论。
