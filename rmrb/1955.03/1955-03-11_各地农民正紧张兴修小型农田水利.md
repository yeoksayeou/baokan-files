    Farmers Across the Country are Tensely Constructing Small-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy Projects

    To prepare for increased agricultural production this year, farmers across the country are working hard to build small-scale water conservancy projects and expand the area of irrigated farmland. Farmers in many mountainous and hilly areas are vigorously constructing water storage and diversion projects such as canals, ponds, and small reservoirs. Coupled with state-invested water conservancy projects on state-run farms and large-scale irrigation projects, the total planned completion is expected to expand the irrigated area by approximately 8.6 million mu. Farmers in dryland areas of the plains are digging wells and installing waterwheels, with the total planned completion expected to expand the irrigated area by approximately 1.8 million mu. In some areas with the potential to develop mechanized drainage and irrigation, the state is assisting farmers in establishing pumping stations, with the total planned completion expected to expand the irrigated area by approximately 600,000 mu. With the improvement of irrigation management of existing water conservancy facilities and the implementation of rational water use, the country can expand irrigated farmland by a total of 14 million mu this year.

    The climate in the southern provinces is warmer, and farmland water conservancy projects in many areas started construction last winter. Farmers in Sichuan Province had completed more than 4,000 mountain bend ponds and weirs by late February, and more than 7,500 are still under construction. In Neijiang, Suining, Mianyang, Nanchong and other regions, winter paddy fields have generally stored four to five inches of water. Small-scale water conservancy projects run by farmers in the eastern counties of Guangdong Province have been largely completed. In mid-February, farmers in Wanning, Ding'an, and Qiongshan counties on Hainan Island completed 467 small-scale water conservancy projects, enabling more than 47,900 mu of farmland to be cultivated in time for spring plowing. Farmers in Hunan Province have built and repaired more than 350,000 ponds and dams. As of mid-February, farmers in Jiangxi Province had built more than 53,900 projects such as reservoirs, ponds, wells, and canals, expanding and restoring the irrigated area by more than 1,976,600 mu. In Yunnan Province, 90% of the existing ponds and weirs in Yuxi, Chengjiang, Tonghai, Yimen, and Yuanjiang counties have stored water. The winter in the northern provinces is severely cold, and the frozen soil is now melting. Mass small-scale water conservancy projects in Shaanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and other places have either started construction or are actively preparing construction equipment and materials. The Tangshan area of Hebei Province has completed surveying and design work, and many small-scale water conservancy projects have already started. Surveying and material preparation in Liaoning, Jilin and other places are also in full swing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Large-Scale Grassland Survey in Xinjiang to Begin Soon

    Xinjiang Province is about to start grassland survey work. Training for surveying technical cadres is underway.

    At the southern foot of the Altai Mountains, the northern foot of the Kunlun Mountains, in the valleys and hilly areas on both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, and in the marginal areas of the Tarim and Junggar basins, there are vast and fertile grasslands. However, due to natural and material limitations, these grasslands have not been fully utilized, and some have not been used at all. In order to fully understand the grassland situation, gradually carry out planning, and rationally manage and use pastures to meet the needs of livestock production development, the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Animal Husbandry decided to focus on grassland survey work in the five areas of Ili, Tacheng, Altay, Hami, and Hotan, and the two autonomous prefectures of Kizilsu and Bayingolin. The Department of Animal Husbandry has established a grassland survey team. In order to master surveying techniques, cadres have been transferred from the above areas to participate in grassland survey workshops held by the Department of Animal Husbandry. It is expected that they will go to various places for grassland survey work in early May.

    Mechanized Construction Team for the Yangtze River Bridge

    The construction start date of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is approaching, and a bridge mechanized construction team, including dozens of types of workers, is being trained and formed. A few days ago, more than 20 special technicians from the large drilling rig training class graduated and participated in the preparatory work for the start of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project. Workers who participated in concrete and diving training classes last year and this year have been able to work independently after a period of practical work training, and are currently continuing to study concrete factory operation and underwater welding techniques in preparation for new tasks. Hundreds of technicians who have grown up in practical work positions such as the Hanshui Railway Bridge construction site, the Hankou-Hanyang railway connection construction site, and the Hanshui Highway Bridge construction site have now been trained into skilled riggers, concrete workers, riveters, carpenters, welders, and fitters, and other bridge technicians. These workers will soon participate in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge in complete teams and shifts. Before and after the official start of the bridge project, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau will also assemble a group of skilled technicians and new workers to participate in the bridge construction work.

    Baoji-Chengdu Railway to Begin Comprehensive Construction

    The main construction section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway this year is more than 300 kilometers long. At present, more than 100,000 laborers are working hard to complete the projects started last year and are vigorously carrying out preparations for comprehensive construction.

    In the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, workers have begun laying rails northward from Guangyuan, and plan to lay the rails to Lueyang by the end of the year. The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is preparing for comprehensive construction, and some projects have already started. This year's construction task for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has increased by 25% compared to last year, and the entire line's construction project has entered the most difficult and complex section. The total length of tunnels to be excavated will be nearly 50 kilometers, and more than 300 bridges will be built. The longest Qinling tunnel on the Baoji-Chengdu line will also be more than half completed this year. The difficult and complex projects such as the Guanyinshan Station built on the mountainside will also be fully constructed this year. In order to adapt to the needs of road construction, the Jialing River channel must also be relocated.

    Currently, most of the dozens of transportation roads connecting various work areas and work sites have begun construction, and the tractor transportation lanes and light rails used for transporting materials to the cliff construction sites have started. The measurement and installation preparation of the overhead cableway have been completed. Air compressors, rock drills, and water pumps required for construction have been transported to the construction site in large quantities, and the power plant is being expanded. Vehicles transporting equipment are constantly flowing on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, transporting large quantities of steel bars, cement, and other materials to the construction site.

    Neijiang Sugar Factory in Sichuan Begins Construction

    The largest mechanized sugarcane sugar factory in Southwest China has begun construction in Neijiang, the sugarcane production center of the Tuojiang River Basin in Sichuan.

    The complete set of equipment for the Neijiang Sugar Factory is designed by Chinese engineers and technicians, and the main equipment such as pressing, cleaning, and sugar formation is being manufactured by several large machinery factories in Northeast China and other places. The construction and installation project of the main workshop of this sugar factory will be basically completed within this year, and it is expected to be put into production when the fourth quarter pressing season starts in 1956. After it starts production, the daily crushing amount of sugarcane is equivalent to the total daily sugarcane crushing amount of more than 150 sugar mills, and it can produce more than 10,000 tons of white sugar per year with the same quality and quantity of raw materials compared with the traditional method of sugar production.

    At present, the preparatory work for the factory site leveling before the official construction of this factory has been completed, a large number of building materials are being transported to the construction site, and the auxiliary workshop and auxiliary building projects have begun.
