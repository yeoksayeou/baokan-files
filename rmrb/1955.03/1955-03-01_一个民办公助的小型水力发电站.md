    A Small Hydroelectric Power Station Run Jointly by the People and with Government Assistance
    Liu Yun, Agriculture Section Chief of Huanren County, Liaoning Province
    Not long ago, the small hydroelectric power station in Yahekou Village, Huanren County, Liaoning Province, was successfully built. For the first time, farmers in the whole village obtained the electricity needed for threshing and milling rice, and enjoyed the light of electric lamps.
    Yahekou Village is a remote mountain village, twenty miles away from Huanren County. To the west of the village is the Ya River, where farmers build dams to divert water for irrigation. The whole village has 2,040 mu of paddy fields, accounting for 52 percent of the total cultivated land. There are 375 households in the village, and 178 households participate in four agricultural production cooperatives; farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations account for 92 percent of the total number of households. In recent years, due to the continuous development of agricultural and sideline production, the living standards of farmers have improved year by year, and the cultural level of the masses has also been continuously improved. At present, all school-age children in the village are enrolled in school, 80 percent of young men and women under the age of thirty have received primary school education, and one-third of adults over the age of thirty are literate. Therefore, farmers have an urgent need to improve production conditions and further improve their material and cultural lives. They feel that the more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields in the village take a lot of time and effort to thresh every year, and affect winter sideline production. In order to solve this problem, the Huanren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Huanren County People's Government decided to build a small hydroelectric power station in the village on a trial basis. With the approval and support of the Liaoning Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the hydropower station started construction on August 7, 1954, and was completed on September 24, and officially supplied electricity on National Day.
    Mountain Villages Also Use Electricity
    The construction of the small hydroelectric power station has brought great benefits to the people of Yahekou Village. The electricity generated by the power station's hydro-turbine generator can drive two 10-horsepower rice milling machines, and can also supply 7.5 kilowatts of power for electric threshing machines or 7 kilowatts of lighting electricity. The two rice milling machines can mill 20,000 jin of rice in 24 hours of operation every day, which not only saves a lot of fuel compared with diesel engines, but also improves the rice milling efficiency by 1.6 times. Using electricity to drive the threshing machine, eight people working eight hours a day can thresh 22,000 jin of grain, which improves the efficiency by five times compared with manual threshing (eight people working ten hours can only thresh 4,400 jin), and greatly reduces physical labor. The labor saved in this way can be invested in sideline production.
    Now, 246 households in the village who live in concentrated areas, as well as district offices, schools, cooperatives, and health clinics, have installed more than 280 electric lights, which can save 560 jin of kerosene per month. Assuming that each household uses 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, and each kilowatt-hour is calculated at 300 yuan in old currency, the monthly electricity bill is only 9,000 yuan in old currency, which is equivalent to the price of only two jin of kerosene. Therefore, the installation of electric lights is welcomed by farmers.
    But currently, the electricity is not being fully utilized. Because milling and threshing are time-sensitive, and lighting only requires six hours a day, but the power station is generating electricity every moment. The village plans to install another grass cutter and corn sheller this year, and use electricity to pump water to irrigate 100 mu of upland paddy fields, grind bone meal to supply agricultural fertilizer, grind corn cobs to make pig feed, etc., and strive to utilize all the electricity.
    The construction of the power station is a great education and encouragement to the farmers of Yahekou Village. On the day when the electricity was first supplied, the village was as lively as during the New Year, the streets were crowded with people, and every household was illuminated with bright electric lights. Seventy-three-year-old Grandpa Pu said: "I can still use electric lights and listen to the radio in my lifetime. Now I have seen socialism!" The construction of the hydroelectric power station has powerfully encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to develop mutual aid and cooperation. The agricultural production cooperative in this village has been further expanded. The farmers said: In the future, we must believe in the words of the Communist Party and take the socialist road. More than 5,000 cadres, farmers, and students from all over the county have come to Yahekou Village to visit, and farmers in some villages said after visiting: "We must work harder to run the cooperatives well, improve production, create conditions, and strive to build power stations as soon as possible." Farmers who used to think that mountain gullies had no future now realize that they can use river water to generate electricity and have electric lights like cities, so they are at ease with production and building the countryside.
    Construction Process
    Before the construction of the station, the county organized a visiting group composed of the county's agricultural section chief, district chief, village branch secretary, water conservancy technical cadres, carpenters, and blacksmiths to visit the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province to learn about the technical design and management experience of small hydroelectric power stations. After the visit, the cadres' confidence in building the station was enhanced. They returned to the village to introduce and publicize it to the masses, which powerfully encouraged the enthusiasm of the farmers in the whole village to build the station.
    The construction of the power station was carried out in accordance with the principle of joint public-private operation and government assistance. We encountered many difficulties in the process of building the station, but thanks to the specific leadership of the Party committee and the strong support of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and other departments, and by giving full play to the strength and wisdom of the masses, these difficulties were overcome, and the problems of equipment, technicians, funds, and labor required for the construction of the station were all solved.
    In order to reduce the burden on farmers, we adopted the method of adapting to local conditions and using local materials as much as possible to reduce project costs, while strictly ensuring electricity safety. The civil engineering project utilized the original irrigation area canals, extending and widening them. The canal flow rate is one cubic meter per second, and there is a drop of 5.15 meters at the tail water outlet, which provides favorable conditions in terms of water energy. The original river dam was a willow branch and stone dam. In order to ensure water use, the dam was raised and reinforced and utilized; other facilities such as water inlet gates, flood control gates, and drainage gates all utilized the original buildings of the irrigation area. The entire project only involved the construction of new control gates and five factory buildings. In terms of mechanical and electrical equipment, the money spent was also limited. Water turbines and lightning arresters were manufactured by the masses themselves by giving full play to their wisdom and creativity.
    Huanren County only had one water conservancy technician, who had no experience in electrical and mechanical matters. Therefore, it was necessary to actively train technical personnel with preliminary knowledge of water conservancy and mechanical and electrical engineering. When organizing the visit, the county consciously selected skilled carpenters and blacksmiths who were familiar with electricity to participate. In the manufacturing of water turbines and the installation of machinery, these two people were used as the backbone, and the task was completed by adopting the method of apprenticeships. When erecting power lines and installing electric lights, the mine and the county post and telecommunications bureau specially sent technicians to lead young farmers in the village to work. After ten days, five young people had learned the techniques of line erection and installation, ensuring the completion of the entire project on schedule.
    Because we tried our best to adopt methods of obtaining materials locally and saving money, the entire power station project only cost 250 million yuan in old currency. Among them, 100.8 million yuan in old currency was used to purchase necessary equipment (generators, transmission lines, etc.) and auxiliary electrical equipment and cement, which was solved by state loans; the remaining costs for factory buildings, line poles, wood, and more than 700 man-days, totaling about 140 million yuan in old currency, were entirely solved by the labor and funds of the masses. Laborers who participated in the work were paid. Members of agricultural production cooperatives who participated in the work had their labor days calculated within the cooperative; non-members who participated in the work had their wages reasonably assessed, which would be deducted from the electricity bills in the future.
    The power station is jointly owned by four agricultural production cooperatives. The labor and funds invested by each cooperative are converted into shares, which serve as the public property of the four cooperatives. A management committee is composed of representatives from the four cooperatives, the village branch secretary, the district committee, and representatives of electricity users. The management committee is responsible to the four station-building cooperatives and all electricity users, and regularly studies major matters such as the power station's various production plans, management systems, expenditure of funds, and distribution of electricity bill income. It also actively conducts publicity and education on electricity usage knowledge to the masses, and organizes electricity usage groups to formulate electricity usage covenants. The management committee has a station director (partially detached from production) who manages the daily work of the power station in accordance with the resolutions of the management committee. Members of the management committee do not receive salaries at the power station. The power station also has one full-time technician, a technician assistant, and a half-time accountant. The power station's monthly income from electricity lighting fees is 2.1 million yuan in old currency, which can offset the monthly recurring expenses. The processing part can obtain an annual profit of 60 million yuan in old currency, and threshing can generate an income of 5 million yuan in old currency. Eighty percent of the profit is used to repay the loan, which is expected to be repaid in three years, and the remaining 20 percent is used as a public accumulation fund and depreciation expenses.
    A Few Experiences
    Through this leadership of the station construction work, we deeply realized that building a small hydroelectric power station is not as difficult as imagined. In the past, we thought that building a power station required building a large dam with reinforced concrete and installing complex mechanical equipment like "Xiaofengman." But this was absolutely impossible for the county. However, after visiting the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, we saw that using the water flow drop of ordinary canals to drive water turbines, drive generators, and pull up power lines could generate and transmit electricity. In reality, it was not as mysterious as imagined.
    Based on the experience of this station construction work, we feel that if there are suitable natural conditions (abundant water sources, with enough water even during the dry season, and a suitable drop in the waterway to provide sufficient water energy, etc.), a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, a real need for production, and appropriate solutions to funding and technical problems, then such small hydroelectric power stations can be built selectively with emphasis. This type of small hydroelectric power station does not cost much money and is of great significance for solving the current needs of the masses in production and life, and for raising the ideological awareness of farmers.
    Preparations must be made for the construction of a small hydroelectric power station. First of all, reconnaissance and design work must be done well, especially the issue of water sources must be considered comprehensively, and power generation water and agricultural water must be considered as a whole. There must be careful design and planning for the power generation components so that orders can be placed early. In this station construction in Yahekou Village, some equipment was purchased from many places, rather than being available in one factory. Therefore, preparations must be made early to avoid rushing around temporarily and being unable to keep up with the needs of the project.
    According to the climate of the Northeast South Manchuria region, the freezing period is about five or six months. If no anti-freeze measures are taken, electricity cannot be generated in winter. However, in rural areas, threshing, milling, other sideline production, and cultural studies are mostly carried out in winter, and electricity is urgently needed. Based on the experience of the masses, when the ice is three inches thick, a foot-thick layer of rice straw is placed on the ice surface to prevent the ice layer from thickening and to maintain smooth water flow under the ice, so that electricity can continue to be generated. After adopting this method, electricity could still be generated as of early January. We will continue to study and improve it to strive to prevent power generation from stopping in winter.

    一个民办公助的小型水力发电站
    辽宁省桓仁县农业科长　刘云
    不久以前，辽宁省桓仁县雅河口村小型水力发电站建设成功了，全村农民第一次得到了脱谷和磨米所需要的电力，并享受到了电灯的光明。
    雅河口村是一个偏僻山村，离桓仁县城二十里。村西有雅河，农民在河里筑坝引水灌田。全村共有水稻田二千零四十亩，占耕地总面积的百分之五十二。全村三百七十五户，有一百七十八户农民参加了四个农业生产合作社；参加互助合作组织的农户占总农户的百分之九十二。几年来由于农、副业生产不断发展，农民生活逐年改善，群众文化程度也在不断提高。目前全村学龄儿童全部就学，三十岁以下男女青年百分之八十受过小学教育，三十岁以上的成年人有三分之一识字。因此，农民们对改善生产条件和进一步提高物质、文化生活有着迫切的要求。他们感到全村二千多亩稻田每年脱谷耗时费力，并影响冬季副业生产。为了解决这个问题，中共桓仁县委和桓仁县人民政府决定在该村试建小型水力发电站。在辽宁省水利局批准和支持下，这个水电站在一九五四年八月七日开工，九月二十四日完成，国庆节正式送电。
    山村也用上了电
    小型水力发电站建成以后，给雅河口村人民带来了巨大的利益。电站水轮发电机所发出的电力，可带动两台十马力的磨米机，同时还可供给电动脱谷机七点五基罗瓦特的电力或七基罗瓦特的照明用电。两台磨米机每天运转二十四小时，可磨出二万斤大米，比用柴油机不仅节省了大量燃料，并提高了磨米效率一点六倍。以电力带动脱谷机，八个人工每天工作八小时可脱谷二万二千斤，比用人力脱谷（八个人工作十小时只能脱谷四千四百斤）提高效率五倍，并大大减轻了体力劳动。这样节省的劳力就可投入副业生产。
    现在全村集中居住的二百四十六户农家和区公所、学校、合作社、卫生所等单位共安装了二百八十多盏电灯，每月可节省煤油五百六十斤。以每家一月用电三十度，每度以旧币三百元计算，每月电费仅旧币九千元，仅相当于二斤煤油的价钱。因此，电灯的安装受到了农民的欢迎。
    但目前电力还用不完。因为磨米脱谷是有时间性的，照明用电每天仅六小时，但电站每时每刻都在发出电力。村里计划今年再安一台铡草机和玉米脱粒机，并用电力抽水灌溉一百亩高地稻田，磨骨粉供应农用肥料，磨玉米骨子做养猪饲料等等，争取把全部电力利用起来。
    电站的建成对雅河口村农民是一个很大的教育和鼓舞。在开始送电的那一天，村内像过年一样热闹，街道上挤满了人群，家家户户，都照耀着明亮的电灯。七十三岁的朴老大爷说：“我这一辈子还能用上电灯，听到广播，现在算是看到社会主义了！”水力发电站的建成有力地鼓舞了群众发展互助合作的热情。这个村的农业生产合作社更进一步扩大了。农民们说：今后更要相信共产党的话，走社会主义道路。全县各地的干部、农民、学生来雅河口村参观的先后已有五千多人，有些村庄的农民参观后表示：“要加劲办好合作社，搞好生产，创造条件，争取早日建立发电站。”过去认为山沟没有前途的农民，现在也认识到能利用河水发电，同城市一样有电灯，因此安心生产，建设农村。
    建站经过
    在建站前，县里组织了有县农业科长、区长、村支部书记、水利技术干部、木工、铁工等参加的参观团，到吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区参观，学习小型水力发电站的技术设计和经营管理经验。参观以后，干部的建站信心提高了，他们回村向群众介绍、宣传，有力地鼓舞了全村农民建站的热情。
    发电站的建设，是采取民办公助的方针进行的。在建站过程中我们遇到了不少困难，但是，由于有党委的具体领导，又得到了省水利局以及其他部门的大力支援，发扬了群众的力量和智慧，这些困难都被克服了，建站所需要的设备、技术人员、经费和人工等问题，都得到了解决。
    为了减少农民负担，我们在严格保证用电安全的条件下，采取因地制宜、就地取材的办法，尽量降低工程成本。土木工程是利用原有灌区渠道，加以延长和扩宽。渠道流量是每秒一立方公尺，在渠尾泄水口处有落差五点一五公尺，这样，就在水能上提供了有利条件。原有拦河坝是柳条压石坝，为了保证用水，就把这条坝加高加固，加以利用；其他如进水闸、防洪闸、排水闸等，都是利用灌区原有的建筑物。整个工程，只有节制闸和五间厂房是新建的。在机电设备方面，也花钱有限。水轮和避雷器等都是发挥群众的智慧和创造性，自行制造的。
    桓仁县只有一名水利技术员，他对电气和机械都毫无经验，因此，必须积极地培养具备有水利和机电初步知识的技术人材。县里在组织参观时，就有意识地选拔了熟练的木工和略通电气的铁工参加。在制造水轮和机械安装工作中，即以这两个人为骨干，采取带徒弟的方式，完成了任务。在架设电线和安装电灯时，矿山和县邮电局特派来技工，带动本村青年农民进行工作，十天以后，就有五名青年学会了架线和安装的技术，保证了全部工程的如期完成。
    由于尽可能采取就地取材和节约的办法，整个电站工程只用了旧币两亿五千万元。其中用于购置必需的设备（发电机、输电线等）和附属电气器材、水泥等旧币一亿零八百万元，由国家贷款解决；其余的厂房、线路杆、木料和七百多个人工等费用约合旧币一亿四千万元，完全由群众的劳力和资金解决。群众出工的有报酬，农业生产合作社社员出工，由社内算劳动日；非社员出工，经过合理评定工资，将来由电费中扣除。
    发电站为四个农业生产合作社共同所有。按各社投入劳力、资金折成股份，做为四个社的公共财产。由四个社的代表、村支部书记、区委会和用电户代表组成管理委员会。管理委员会对四个建站社及全体用电户负责，经常研究电站的各项生产计划、管理制度、经费开支、电费收益分配等重大事宜，并积极向群众进行关于用电知识的宣传教育，组织用电小组订立用电公约。管理委员会下设电站主任（半脱离生产），按照管理委员会的决议掌管电站的日常工作。管理委员会的委员在电站不支薪水。电站还有专职的技师、技师助手和半脱离生产的会计员各一名。电站每月收入电灯费旧币二百一十万元，可以抵付每月经常开支。加工部分每年可得利润旧币六千万元，脱谷可收入旧币五百万元，以利润的百分之八十归还贷款，预计三年可以还清，其余百分之二十做为公积金和折旧费。
    几点体验
    通过这次领导建站工作，我们深刻体会到，建设小型水力发电站并不像想像的那样艰难。在过去，我们想，修发电站必须像“小丰满”那样用钢筋混凝土筑起大坝和安装上复杂的机械设备。而这在县来说，是绝对办不到的。但到延边朝鲜族自治区参观以后，我们看到利用一般渠道水流落差，冲动水轮，带动发电机，拉上电线就可以发电送电，实际上，这并不像想像的那样神秘。
    根据这次建站工作的体验，我们感到，如果有适当的自然条件（水源充沛，既使在枯水期也有足够的水量，水道有适当的落差可以提供充分的水能等），互助合作基础较好，生产上确实需要，资金、技术问题能得到适当解决，像这样的小型水力发电站是可以有重点地个别兴办的。这种小型水力发电站花钱不多，对解决当前群众生产和生活的需要，对提高农民思想觉悟，都有很大的意义。
    建设小型水力发电站必须做好准备工作。首先，要做好勘查设计工作，特别是对水源问题要从全面规划，发电用水和农业用水要通盘考虑。对发电的机件要有周密的设计、计划，以便早日订货。雅河口村这次建站，一些器材是从很多地方买到的，而不是在一个工厂可以办全的，因此，必须早做准备，以免临时赶办，忙乱被动、赶不上工程需要。
    按东北南满地区气候，结冻期大约有五、六个月，如不做好防冻措施，冬季是不能发电的。但在农村，脱谷磨米和其他副业生产、文化学习，大部在冬季进行，都迫切需要电力。我们根据群众经验，在冰冻三寸厚时，在冰面覆上一尺厚的稻草，使冰层不再加厚，维持冰下水流畅通，可以继续发电。采取这个办法以后截至一月上旬，仍能发电。我们还要继续研究改进，力争冬季不停止发电。
