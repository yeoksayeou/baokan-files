    The Power to Overcome Difficulties
    —Reading the Soviet Novel "The Bold"
    Shi Bing
    Written by Vera Ketlinskaya, translated by Guan Yusu, published by China Youth Publishing House
    The novel "The Bold" is a poetic generalization of the heroism displayed by Soviet Komsomol members in their offensive against life during the construction of Komsomolsk. The keynote running through the entire book is: "One should seize future happiness. Dying in this life is not difficult, but building a life is much more difficult." (Page 135) The labor of building a new life has a magnetic attraction and mythical allure for the Komsomol members, encouraging the younger generation to love it with all their heart and dedicate their youth and even their lives to it.

    The work of building Komsomolsk is a struggle against all kinds of difficulties and overcoming them. With perseverance, courage, and diligence, the Komsomol members overcame gales, rainstorms, ice, snow, cold, and disease; they overcame bureaucratic thinking and work styles in leadership; they overcame various difficulties caused by the lack of material equipment; and they overcame rumors, intimidation, framing, assassination, and sabotage by lurking class enemies. This fighting collective, like a rocket, was invincible and quickly destroyed all the difficulties standing in the way of construction. The source of their fighting power lies in their love for labor, the Party, the people, and the Soviet regime, as well as the firm will formed under the Party's education. It is precisely because of this that they were able to create miracles on the desolate banks of the Heilongjiang River, building a new city with large factories, electric lights, cinemas, schools, nurseries, and hospitals, turning mythical construction plans into reality, and adding a more beautiful flower to this nature full of primal beauty with labor and youth.

    However, the existence of difficulties has different meanings for different people. In the eyes of the weak-willed, timid, and egoistic, difficulties are a terrible threat, an invincible demon of fate. It can make people discouraged, depressed, fearful, and retreat, until they escape from the collective like Golitsyn, thus losing true happiness, honor, and spiritual beauty, and becoming petty and mediocre. Although he returned to the collective with a painful feeling of repentance after realizing the shamefulness of this action, and established meritorious service; however, that action of turning away from the era that had occurred cast an indelible shadow on his political life and soul. People should catch up with the speed of time's progress, otherwise, a slight delay will be ruthlessly thrown behind life. Wasn't Nikolai Platt frozen to death in the snow without any pity on his way of "desertion?" However, in the eyes of strong-willed fighters, difficulties are an object of combat. "Because the existence of difficulties is for people to fight and overcome them." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 8, p. 133) Overcoming difficulties "is for the full realization of people's ability to obtain sunshine, light, labor, free breathing, and a sense of freedom." (Page 812) At the same time, they also gain true happiness and honor, becoming great and sublime. Therefore, Yefanov dared to risk his life to drive two cars across the thawing Heilongjiang River. Although Grisha Ishakov was blind, he still refused to leave the construction site and used poems to summon those who had fled to return. Because, in his view, "My eyes are blind, but I can see the truth more clearly than those who have their eyes open." (Page 316) Matveyev gloriously, heroically, and tragically sacrificed himself in labor with illness, forming a clear contrast with the death of Nikolai Platt, which are two different paths of life.

    The process of building Komsomolsk is also the process of "socialist construction of man." Because, for the Komsomol members, "not all people find the correct path in life at once," (Preface to the Chinese translation) but through personal experience and special paths in labor, they truly and profoundly recognize and understand the content and meaning of life. They painfully overcome the things that remain in themselves that are incompatible with the new life; in their hearts, in the new birth of attitudes towards life, attitudes towards labor, attitudes towards women, and attitudes towards comrades, they build "the novel and sublime socialist entire content that revives reason and emotion." (Page 812) In labor, they became Stakhanovite workers, creators, and inventors. The more each person clearly and proudly "feels and is aware that he is a free creator and master of life" (Gorky: "Soviet Literature"), the more they can give full play to their wisdom and creativity, more actively build a prosperous life, and approach the realization of a better ideal step by step. Therefore, the inspiration of "The Bold" for the youth who are engaged in the great labor construction cause of our motherland is that we must profoundly understand the meaning of life and recognize people in the cause of labor construction, and transform this understanding into the ideological and emotional basis of faith in the communist cause, and become an important factor in forming our strong will. Only in this way can we fully, permanently, consciously, and increasingly strongly give play to our initiative and enthusiasm in the cause of labor construction, and can we not succumb to any difficulties, but instead step over difficulties and move forward. "The Bold" points out a living, true path of life. On this road, we must get rid of the remaining influence of old ideas, morals, and habits in a down-to-earth manner rather than floating on top of life, and cultivate our will, faith, and moral character. Without personal practice in labor construction, it is impossible to pursue the true path of life, or to make one's understanding of life remain only in abstract fantasies, or even live blindly. The different life paths of each Komsomol member in "The Bold" fully embody, illustrate, and confirm this point.

    The most attractive character in "The Bold" is the Party Committee Secretary Morozov. This resolute and courageous Bolshevik correctly and profoundly embodies the Party's leadership thought and leadership art. He summarized his understanding of people into the poetic maxim that "people are more precious than gold." The decisive factor in the cause of labor construction lies in people with lofty life ideals and love for labor, and the ultimate goal of construction is precisely for the collective composed of these people to live better. "Building a city on the one hand and building people on the other" is the entire content of the construction cause as he understands it. He places the "socialist construction of man" in a very important position. Without this, the cause of labor construction lacks a strong guarantee and cannot move forward persistently and rapidly, or even stagnate and disintegrate. However, some leaders simply pursue the "speed" of rapid completion of construction, simply regard people as active tools, and "use" people in a simple way. Morozov resolutely opposes this erroneous thinking and work style, because it will directly bring huge losses and harmful effects to the construction cause, making the construction cause a "task" that has lost its lofty purpose. Therefore, he cares about the thoughts, lives, friendships, love, and families of the Komsomol members, fully understands, grasps, develops, and gives play to the individual characteristics of each person, closely unites them around himself with exemplary actions, and carefully cultivates and educates them to become fully conscious, independent, and creative fighters for building a new life. Although the counter-revolutionaries murdered him, the spiritual power generated by his influence on the youth is becoming stronger and stronger. Morozov's understanding of people and the leadership art based on this understanding have universal and profound educational significance for us. Because, at present, many of our comrades who are engaged in youth work are not good at recognizing and understanding the complexity and particularity of their work objects—people, and they do not use their brains to replace leadership thought and lively and complex leadership art with ready-made slogans and simple organizational methods. Isolating and separating the construction cause from the construction of people, and to some extent ignoring or underestimating the latter, objectively hinders or even destroys the perfect height of political, moral, and emotional achievements that people should reach. On this point, we should get a lot of inspiration from "The Bold."

    "The Bold" reflects a vigorous event full of tense battles, labor, creation, and construction. However, the author did not put her pen completely on the description of the labor construction process itself, the activities of machines, etc., but concentrated her efforts to grasp and reveal more deeply the complex spiritual outlook of people in labor, expressing people's inner feelings, excitement, joy, sorrow, pain, fantasy, hope, etc., expressing the tortuous, subtle, and complex changes in people's thoughts and emotions caused by the influence of the objective environment, and fully attracting the reader's attention to the imagination and thinking of the characters. The reason why "The Bold" has such a very distinct artistic feature, and is not like a boring report of the construction process, is due to the author's correct and profound understanding of the relationship between labor and people, a profound understanding and grasp of the characteristics of literature as "human science" and its objects. However, through the author's special lyrical style, one can still feel and imagine the mood of tense labor and struggle, and hear the sound of fighting that resounds in the struggle with nature, with the enemy, and in people's hearts, so that the magnificent theme of labor struggle and the beautiful lyricism reach a harmonious unity.

    The reason why "The Bold" is particularly welcomed by the vast number of young people and youth workers in China is that it brings infinitely rich spiritual power and enlightenment. Seriously studying it will play a great role in cultivating the will and morality of young people and improving the leadership art of youth work.

    战胜困难的力量
    ——读苏联长篇小说“勇敢”
    石冰
    薇拉·凯特玲斯卡雅著　关予素译　中国青年出版社出版
    长篇小说“勇敢”是苏联共青团员们在建设共青城的劳动中所表现出的向生活进攻的英雄主义精神的诗的概括。贯串在全书中的基调就是：“应当夺取未来的快乐。在这一生中死并不困难，但建设生活却困难得多。”（一三五页）建设新生活的劳动事业，对于共青团员们具有磁石样的吸引力和神话般的诱惑力，鼓舞着青年一代用全部发自内心的热情去爱它，把青春甚至生命都贡献给它。
    建设共青城的工作，就是向各种各样的困难作斗争并战胜它。共青团员们以坚毅、勇敢、勤劳的精神，战胜了狂风、暴雨、冰雪、寒冷、疾病；战胜了领导工作中的官僚主义思想和作风；战胜了缺乏物质设备的种种困难，战胜了潜藏着的阶级敌人的谣言、恐吓、陷害、暗杀与破坏。这个战斗着的集体，像一个火箭，所向无敌地迅速地摧毁了一切摆在建设中的困难。他们这种战斗力量的源泉是由于对劳动、对党、对人民和苏维埃政权的热爱，以及在党的教养下所形成的坚定的意志。正因如此，才能够在荒僻的黑龙江边创造出奇迹，建设起有大工厂、电灯、电影院、学校、托儿所、医院的新城市，把神话般的建设计划变成了现实，用劳动、青春给这充满着原始美的大自然，增添了一朵更美丽的花。
    但是，困难的存在对于不同的人有着不同的意义。在意志薄弱的胆怯的利己主义者看来，困难是一种可怕的威胁，不可战胜的命运的恶魔。它可以使人灰心、颓丧、恐惧、退缩、直至像果里岑那样从集体中逃走，因而失去了真正的幸福、荣誉、精神的美，变得渺小而庸俗。虽然在他觉悟到这种行动的可耻之后，又怀着忏悔的痛苦心情回到集体中来，并且建立了功勋；但是，那种曾经发生的同时代背向的行动，已经在他的政治生命和心灵中投下了一个不可磨灭的黑影。人们应该追赶时间前进的速度，否则，稍一延迟，就会被无情地抛在生活的后面。尼古拉·普拉特不就是在“开小差”的途中毫不值得怜悯地冻死在冰雪中了么？然而，困难在意志坚强的战斗者看来，它是一个战斗的对象。“因为困难的存在就是为了让人跟它作斗争并克服它。”（斯大林全集第八卷一三三页）战胜困难就“是为的充分让人们能够得到阳光、光明、劳动、自由的呼吸和自由的感觉。”（八一二页）同时也使自己获得了真正的幸福、荣誉，变得伟大而崇高。所以耶比法诺夫敢于冒着生命的危险驾驶着两部汽车通过正在解冻的黑龙江。格里莎·伊沙果夫虽然瞎了眼睛，也仍不愿离开建设工地，而且用诗句召唤那些逃跑的人回来。因为，在他看来，“我的眼睛瞎了，可是对于真理我看得比睁眼的人更清楚”。（三一六页）马特维耶夫带着病在劳动中光荣、英勇而悲壮地牺牲了，和尼古拉·普拉特的死形成了两条不同生活道路的鲜明的对比。
    建设共青城的过程也是“人的社会主义建设”的过程。因为，对于共青团员们，“并不是所有的人都是一下子就找到了正确的生活道路”，（中译本序）而是通过各个人在劳动中的亲身体验和特殊的道路，才真正地深刻地认识理解了生活的内容和意义。他们痛苦地克服着本身所残留着的与新的生活不相谐调的东西；在心里，在人生态度、劳动态度、对待妇女和对待同志的态度和思想与感觉的新生中，建设起“使理智和感情苏生的新颖而崇高的社会主义全部内容”。（八一二页）他们在劳动中一个个地成了斯塔哈诺夫工作者、创造者、发明者。而越是当每个人明确而骄傲地“感觉自己和意识自己是自由的创造者和生活的主人翁”（高尔基：“苏联的文学”）时，也就愈能发挥他们的智慧和创造性，更积极地建设欣欣向荣的生活，一步一步地接近更美好的理想的实现。因此，“勇敢”对于我们正在从事祖国的伟大的劳动建设事业的青年的启发，就是要我们在劳动建设的事业中，去深刻地认识生活的意义，认识人，把这认识转化为对共产主义事业信仰的思想的感情的基础，成为构成自己的坚强意志的重要因素。只有这样才能够在劳动建设事业中充分地、恒久地、自觉地、愈来愈强烈地发挥自己的积极性和主动性，才能不向任何困难屈服，而是踏过困难前进。“勇敢”所指出的是活生生的真正的生活的路。要在这条道路上脚踏实地地而不是飘浮在生活上面地摆脱旧的思想、道德、习惯的残余影响，培养自己的意志、信仰和道德品质。离开了在劳动建设中的亲身实践；就不可能追求到真正的生活的路，或者是使自己对生活的理解仅仅停留在抽象的幻想上，甚至盲目地生活。“勇敢”中每个共青团员不同的生活道路充分体现、说明、证实了这一点。
    “勇敢”中最吸引人的是党委书记莫洛佐夫的形象。这个坚毅、勇敢的布尔什维克，正确而深刻地体现着党的领导思想和领导艺术。他把对于人的理解总结为富有诗意的“人比黄金更宝贵”的格言。劳动建设事业的决定性的因素在于有着崇高的生活理想和热爱劳动的人，而建设的最终目的也正是为了由这些人所组成的集体生活得更好。“一面要建设城市、一面要建设人”就是他所理解的建设事业的全部内容。他把“人的社会主义建设”放在非常重要的位置。离开了这一点，劳动建设事业就缺乏有力的保证，不可能持久地迅速地前进，甚至停滞、瓦解。可是有些领导者只是单纯地为了迅速地完成建设的“速度”，仅仅把人看作活动着的工具，用简单的办法来“使用”人。莫洛佐夫坚决反对这种错误思想和作风，因为它会直接给建设事业带来巨大的损失和有害的影响，使得建设事业变成了失掉了崇高目的的一种“任务”。因此他关心共青团员们的思想、生活、友谊、爱情、家庭，充分了解、把握、发展、发挥每人的个性特点，用模范的行动把他们紧紧地团结在自己的周围，细心地培养教育他们成为完全自觉的、独立的、创造性的建设新生活的战士。虽然反革命分子杀害了他，但是，由他的影响而在青年们身上所产生的精神力量，却是愈来愈强大了。莫洛佐夫对人的理解以及基于这一理解而产生的领导艺术，对于我们有着普遍而深刻的教育意义。因为，在目前，我们很多作青年工作的同志，还不善于认识理解自己的工作对象——人的复杂性和特殊性，不开动脑筋地用现成的口号和简单的组织方法来代替领导思想和生动活泼而复杂的领导艺术。把建设事业与建设人孤立地分割开来，并在某种程度上忽视或轻视后者，客观上阻碍了甚至破坏了人应该达到的政治的道德的感情的完美高度。在这一点上，我们应该从“勇敢”中得到很多的启发。
    “勇敢”所反映的是一个轰轰烈烈的充满紧张的战斗、劳动、创造、建设的事件。但是，作者并没有把她的笔触完全放在对于劳动建设过程本身、对于机器的活动等等的描写上，而是集中力量更深刻地去把握、揭示人们在劳动中所表现出的复杂的精神面貌，表现出人们内心的感受、激动、欢乐、忧伤、痛苦、幻想、希望等等，表现出由于客观环境的影响而引起的人们思想情感中曲折细微而复杂的变化过程，把读者的注意力完全吸引到对于人物形象的想像和思考中去。“勇敢”所以具有这样一个非常鲜明的艺术特点，而不像枯燥的建设过程的报告，是由于作者对于劳动与人的关系的正确而深刻的理解，对于作为“人学”的文学的特征以及它的对象的深刻的了解和把握。但是，通过作者特殊的抒情诗的笔调，仍然可以感触、想像到紧张的劳动和斗争的情绪，听到那响彻在与自然、与敌人以及人们内心中的搏斗的声音，使劳动斗争的雄伟的主题与优美的抒情达到了和谐的一致。
    “勇敢”之所以特别地受到中国的广大青年和青年工作者的热烈欢迎，就是因为它带来了无限丰富的精神力量和启示。认真地去学习它，对于培养青年的意志、道德，对于提高青年工作的领导艺术，是会起很大的作用的。
