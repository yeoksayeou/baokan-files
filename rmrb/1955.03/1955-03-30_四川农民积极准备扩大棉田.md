Sichuan farmers are actively preparing to expand cotton fields.

Sichuan Province plans to plant more than 4,370,000 mu of cotton this year, an expansion of more than 430,000 mu compared to last year. The total cotton output is required to increase by 15% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has already transported 550,000 jin of superior seeds of "Chicken Foot Dezi Cotton" and "Dezi 531" to Ziyang, Fengjie, and 13 other counties for promotion. Before April, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will successively supply cotton-producing areas with more than 6,400 tons of ammonium sulfate, more than 1,300 tons of phosphate rock powder, as well as fertilizers such as rapeseed cake and tung cake. At the same time, large quantities of pesticides and equipment for preventing and controlling cotton diseases and insect pests are being supplied. In the 24 key cotton-producing counties alone, more than 5,000 single-tube sprayers and 424 tons of 0.5% "666" powder have been supplied. Cotton cultivation techniques have been taught at the agricultural model representative conferences and spring plowing production conferences in various cotton-producing areas, and production assistants in key cotton-planting areas have been trained as the backbone for promoting cotton planting techniques. Currently, cotton-producing areas are helping agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and cotton farmers to formulate cotton production increase plans. Cotton farmers are also actively engaged in tasks such as accumulating and producing fertilizer, processing land, selecting and changing seeds, and learning yield-increasing technologies.

    四川农民积极准备扩大棉田
    四川省今年计划种棉四百三十七万多亩，比去年扩大了四十三万多亩，棉花总产量要求在去年丰收的基础上增加百分之十五。现在省农林厅已把五十五万斤“鸡脚德字棉”和“德字五三一”号良种，运到资阳、奉节等十五县推广。省供销合作社在四月份以前陆续供应产棉区硫酸錏六千四百多吨。磷矿粉一千三百多吨以及菜枯、桐枯等肥料。同时，大量供应防治棉花病虫害的农药器械，在二十四个重点产棉县，即供应了单管式喷雾器五千多部，百分之零点五“六六六”药粉四百二十四吨。各产棉区在专区、县农业模范代表会和春耕生产会议上传授了棉花栽培技术，并训练了重点植棉区的生产助理员，作为推广植棉技术的骨干。现在各产棉区正帮助农业生产合作社、互助组及棉农制订棉花增产计划，棉农们也积极地做好积肥造肥、土地加工、选种换种和学习增产技术等工作。（本报驻重庆记者）
