Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: According to TASS, representatives of workers and trade union organizations from France, West Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Italy, Poland, and Czechoslovakia recently held a meeting in Berlin. The meeting participants unanimously supported the initiative of many enterprise trade union committees in France to hold a conference of European working people and trade union representatives against West German remilitarization and the implementation of the Paris Accords. Based on the suggestion of employees from various enterprises in Leipzig, the conference is scheduled to be held in Leipzig from April 22nd to 24th, 1955. The preparatory committee selected to prepare for the conference has published an appeal to all working people and trade union organizations in Europe.

The appeal pointed out that the actions of all European workers and trade union organizations to safeguard peace and improve living conditions have achieved great success, but the danger has not been eliminated. The main source of anxiety is the dangerous policy of international capital. Military budgets are constantly increasing, and the expansion of armaments is being intensified. Some people are plotting new attacks on the wages, social welfare, trade union rights, and democratic rights of the working people.

The appeal then pointed out that the peace forces of the world have put forward many suggestions in order to ease the international situation through negotiations. However, war-mongers are trying to increase the danger of war.

The appeal said that there is now a force that can prevent this danger. This is the power of solidarity of the working people of all countries in the world, this is the power of the working people of Europe. United, we are invincible. Only united can we open the road to collective security, disarmament, reduced military budgets, and ensure the peaceful development of economic and social life.

The appeal concluded by saying, let us work together to make the Leipzig conference an important step towards a future of peace and happiness for Europe.

    欧洲一些国家劳动人民和工会代表集会
    决定举行反对西德重新军国主义化和反对实施巴黎协定会议
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：法国、西德、德意志民主共和国、意大利、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克企业工人和工会组织代表不久前在柏林举行了会议。会议参加者一致支持法国许多企业工会委员会的倡议：举行欧洲劳动人民和工会代表反对西德重新军国主义化和反对实施巴黎协定的会议。根据来比锡各企业员工的建议，这次会议定在一九五五年四月二十二日到二十四日在来比锡举行。为筹备这次会议选出的筹备委员会发表了给欧洲全体劳动人民和工会组织的号召书。
    号召书指出，欧洲全体劳动者和工会组织维护和平和改善生活条件的行动，已经获得了巨大的成就，但是危险远没有消除。引起焦虑的主要事情是国际资本的危险政策。军事预算在不断增加，扩充军备在不断加紧。有人正在策划对劳动人民的工资、社会福利、工会权利和民主权利实行新的进攻。
    号召书接着指出，全世界的和平力量提出了许多建议，以便用谈判的方式来缓和国际局势。但是，战争贩子却力图加甚战争危险。
    号召书说，但是，现在有着能防止这种危险的力量。这就是世界各国劳动者的团结的力量，这就是欧洲劳动者的力量。团结起来，我们就是不可战胜的。只有团结起来，我们才能打开通向集体安全、裁军、减少军事预算的道路，才能保证经济生活和社会生活的和平发展。
    号召书最后说，让我们以共同努力来使来比锡会议成为走向欧洲的和平和幸福的未来的重要的一步。
