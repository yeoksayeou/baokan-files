Nationwide Judicial Cadres Universally Study the People's Court Organization Law

Currently, judicial cadres across the nation are universally studying the "Organization Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China."

Since the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice jointly issued instructions in December of last year regarding the study and implementation of the "Organization Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China," People's Courts and judicial administrative departments in various provinces and cities across the country have successively convened meetings, focusing on organizing responsible cadres from judicial departments at all levels within their respective provinces and cities to study the Court Organization Law first. Currently, the vast majority of responsible cadres from judicial departments in various regions have completed their intensive study and are further organizing general judicial cadres to study.

During the study process, judicial cadres in various regions have generally paid attention to linking theory with practice. They have generally combined the study with inspections of their work, criticizing erroneous thoughts and practices that violate the Court Organization Law. Courts in provinces and cities like Hunan and Beijing have also organized participating judicial cadres to observe the trials of some cases, using examples for education. Courts in provinces and cities like Liaoning and Shanghai have specifically studied the typical experiences of Fengcheng County and the Lao Zha District, Yangpu District and other People's Courts in piloting various democratic systems during their study.

Having undergone the study, judicial cadres have clarified the important significance of strengthening the revolutionary legal system during the national construction period, recognizing that "exercising dictatorship" and "protecting democracy" are two inseparable aspects of the People's Courts' fundamental tasks. In particular, they have gained a further understanding of the various democratic systems outlined in the Court Organization Law. Prior to the study, some court cadres in Xi'an believed that implementing various democratic systems was troublesome and would increase the backlog of cases; or that various democratic systems were only applicable to criminal cases and not to civil cases; some court cadres had a rigid style, providing insufficient persuasion and explanation to litigants, restricting defense, and regarding the defendant's defense as "sophistry." After the study, they realized that the implementation of various democratic systems is for the purpose of fully protecting the people's democratic rights and effectively punishing criminals, and is also conducive to the improvement of judicial work, so they automatically criticized various incorrect thoughts and practices. After the study, judicial cadres in various regions generally believe that in order to implement the various democratic systems of the Court Organization Law, judicial personnel must first establish democratic thinking, strengthen their mass viewpoint, and overcome undemocratic thoughts and practices.

After raising their understanding of the Court Organization Law, judicial cadres have increased their confidence and determination to implement it. After studying, judicial cadres in Jiangxi Province felt that judicial workers now have even greater responsibilities in the future, expressing their determination to study hard, handle affairs in accordance with the law, and shoulder their glorious tasks. After studying the Court Organization Law, court cadres in Tianjin City flocked to bookstores to purchase books on legal science knowledge for reading. After criticizing the privileged thinking and illegal and undisciplined phenomena existing among some adjudicators during their study, court cadres in Jiangsu Province proposed that in order to correctly implement the Court Organization Law, judicial cadres themselves must first model compliance with the Constitution and laws. After studying the Court Organization Law, adjudicators in Luoning County in Henan Province, Zhaodong and Qinggang Counties in Heilongjiang Province, and other counties generally improved their adjudication style, not only becoming more amiable towards litigants, but also being able to patiently listen to the defendant's appeals. After the study, most provincial and municipal courts researched and formulated plans or programs for implementing the Court Organization Law in the future. Many regions have proposed in their plans to conscientiously and actively implement various systems such as open trials, defense, and jury. Some places have decided to first implement various systems in one People's Court and one trial court in order to gain experience and gradually apply it. Currently, the work of piloting various democratic systems in courts across the country has begun one after another. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国司法干部普遍学习人民法院组织法
    目前全国司法干部正普遍进行对中华人民共和国人民法院组织法的学习。
    自从最高人民法院和司法部在去年十二月联合发出关于学习和贯彻中华人民共和国人民法院组织法的指示以后，全国各省、市人民法院和司法行政部门都陆续召开了会议，集中本省、市各级司法部门的负责干部首先学习法院组织法。现在，绝大部分地区的司法部门负责干部已经集中学习完毕，正进一步组织一般司法干部进行学习。
    在学习中，各地司法干部大都注意了联系实际。一般都结合检查了工作，批判了违背法院组织法的一些错误思想和作风。湖南、北京等省、市法院还组织参加学习的司法干部旁听了一些案件的审理，用实例进行教育。辽宁、上海等省、市法院在学习中专门研究了凤城县和老闸区、杨浦区等人民法院试行各项民主制度的典型经验。
    经过学习的司法干部，明确了加强革命法制在国家建设时期的重要意义，“实行专政”和“保护民主”是人民法院根本任务的不可分割的两方面，特别是对法院组织法的各项民主制度都有了进一步的认识。学习以前，西安市有些法院干部认为实行各项民主制度很麻烦，会增加积案；或认为各项民主制度只适用于刑事案件，不适用于民事案件；有些法院干部作风生硬，向诉讼当事人说服解释不够，限制辩护，认为被告申辩是“狡辩”。学习以后，他们认识了实行各项民主制度是为了充分保护人民民主权利和有效的惩处罪犯，同时也有利于司法工作的改进，因此都自动地批判了各种不正确的思想和作风。各地司法干部学习以后普遍认为，要贯彻法院组织法的各项民主制度，司法工作人员必须首先树立民主思想、加强群众观点，克服不民主的思想和作风。
    司法干部在提高了对法院组织法的认识以后，增加了贯彻法院组织法的信心和决心。江西省司法干部学习后，感到司法工作者今后的责任更重大了，表示要好好学习，依法办事，担负起自己的光荣任务。天津市法院干部学习法院组织法后，纷纷到书店购买有关法律科学知识的书籍阅读。江苏省法院干部在学习中批判了一些审判人员存在的特权思想和违法乱纪现象以后，提出要正确贯彻法院组织法，首先要司法干部自己模范地遵守宪法和法律。河南省洛宁县，黑龙江省肇东、青冈等县的审判人员学习法院组织法后，审判作风普遍改进，不仅对诉讼人的态度和蔼了，也能耐心听取被告的申诉了。大部分省、市法院在学习以后，研究和制定了今后贯彻法院组织法的计划或方案。许多地区的法院在计划中提出要认真而且积极地贯彻执行公开审理、辩护、陪审等各项制度。有的地方决定首先在一个人民法庭和一个审判庭实行各项制度，以吸取经验逐步加以运用。目前，各地法院试行各项民主制度的工作，已经先后开始。　（新华社）
