Over Ten Thousand Women in the Capital Join Handicraft Cooperatives

Over ten thousand nine hundred women in the capital have joined various handicraft production cooperatives, accounting for forty percent of the total number of people in the city's handicraft production cooperatives.

Women have demonstrated their unique talents in handicraft production cooperatives across various industries. At the end of last year, eight hundred and twenty-two female cooperative members were selected as municipal model workers or outstanding and excellent workers. The vast majority of them are engaged in specialized handicraft labor such as sewing, cotton weaving, knitting, printing, bookbinding, wool weaving, and drawnwork, embroidery, and ivory carving. Many women have mastered techniques such as electric knife tailoring and book page binding as skillfully as their male counterparts. Hao Shuzhen, a female member of the Sixteenth Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative, once set a record of weaving seventeen bolts of serge per month.

All of the over four thousand members of the specialized handicraft—drawnwork production cooperative are women. They use brightly colored embroidery thread to embroider exquisite patterns of scenic spots and historical sites from all over the country and doves of peace on tablecloths and pillowcases. These products are not only loved by the people of the country but also welcomed by international friends. In the past two years, the national trade department has signed contracts with foreign countries for more than 137,000 sets of drawnwork tablecloths, worth 2.5 million yuan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都万余妇女参加手工业社
    首都有一万零九百多名妇女参加了各种手工业生产合作社，占全市手工业生产合作社总人数的百分之四十。
    妇女们在各种行业的手工业生产合作社中，发挥了特有的才能。去年年终时，有八百二十二个女社员当选为市劳动模范或者是优秀和优良工作者。她们绝大多数是担负缝纫、棉织、针织、印刷、装订、毛织和挑花、补绣、象牙雕刻等特种手工艺劳动。很多妇女和男社员一样熟练地掌握了电刀剪裁服装、装订书页等技术。第十六棉织生产合作社女社员郝淑珍曾经创造了每月织冲服呢十七疋的最高纪录。
    特种手工艺——挑花生产合作社四千多个社员全部是妇女。她们用色彩鲜艳的花线，在台布和枕套上挑出祖国各地的名胜古迹与和平鸽等精致图案。这些产品不但受到国内人民的喜爱，也受到国际友人的欢迎。两年来国家贸易部门同国外订立的合同中就有十三万七千多套挑花台布，价值二百五十万元。　（新华社）
