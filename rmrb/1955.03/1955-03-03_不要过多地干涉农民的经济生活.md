    Do Not Interfere Excessively in Farmers' Economic Lives
    Zhong Xia
    All economic measures implemented by the state in rural areas are related to the current or long-term interests of farmers. As long as these measures truly conform to the specific conditions of rural areas, and the reasons are explained to the farmers during implementation, the farmers will consciously complete these tasks. Some economic work cadres, disregarding the actual situation and failing to carry out persuasive education work among farmers, simply issue commands, resulting in a certain artificial tension.
    In order to complete the task of currency withdrawal, cadres of the Finance Department of Guangxi Province forcibly withheld various payments after farmers sold their surplus grain without the farmers' consent. Some farmers had hardly received their grain money before it was almost entirely deducted. The deduction items included: credit cooperative shares, supply and marketing cooperative shares, loan recovery, public bonds, etc., totaling eight or nine items, which farmers called "nine deductions." After such deductions, some farmers' pocket money was completely deducted, and the farmers were very dissatisfied.
    In order to complete these tasks, some agricultural production cooperatives, during the year-end distribution, deducted various payments forcibly from the cooperative's total income or the members' dividends without the members' consent, as designated by the cadres. One agricultural production cooperative, during the year-end distribution, deducted over 20 million yuan in old currency for credit cooperative shares, over 13 million yuan in old currency for supply and marketing cooperative shares, over 7 million yuan in old currency for public bonds, and over 160 million yuan in old currency for agricultural loans (including those of the cooperative and individual members), totaling over 160 million yuan in old currency, accounting for 75% of the members' various incomes besides grain rations, all without the members' consent. This affected the cooperative's production investment, and the members' lives also felt greatly inconvenienced.
    Encouraging farmers to deposit their surplus funds into credit cooperatives or purchase public bonds is originally beneficial to farmers. However, these economic measures must be coordinated with political work, and farmers must be mobilized and educated to make them consciously pay and voluntarily subscribe. Adopting methods of coercion, commands, and cadre designation will inevitably lead to detachment from the masses. As for repaying agricultural loans, although it is different from joining credit cooperatives and subscribing to public bonds, it is also necessary to carry out mobilization and education work among farmers and members to strive for their best efforts to repay; simple deductions are not good.
    It is originally permissible for agricultural production cooperatives to handle some economic work uniformly under the principle of members' consent; if handled properly, it is also beneficial to the consolidation of the cooperative. However, disregarding the specific conditions of the cooperative and forcibly handling it uniformly without the members' willingness will also lead to detachment from the masses and create adverse effects. This phenomenon has also occurred in other regions. Members said: The cooperative "manages too much!" Of course, this is detrimental to the consolidation of the cooperative.

    不要过多地干涉农民的经济生活
    仲夏
    国家在农村中推行的一切经济措施，都是关系到农民的目前或长远利益的。这些措施只要确实符合农村的具体情况，在实行时并向农民说清道理，农民是会自觉地完成这些任务的。有些经济工作干部，不顾实际情况，不向农民进行说服教育工作，简单地以命令行事，结果就造成了某种人为的紧张局面。
    广西省财经部门的干部，为完成货币回笼任务，在农民卖了余粮后，不经农民同意，强迫扣留各种款项；有些农民粮款没有到手，就被扣得差不多了。扣款项目有：信用社股金、供销社股金、贷款收回、公债等八、九项，农民称之为“九扣”。这样扣来扣去，有些农民手头零用钱都被扣光了，农民非常不满意。
    有些农业生产合作社为完成这些任务，在进行年终分配时，不经社员同意，就由干部指定数目，在社的总收入或社员分红中，强迫扣除各种款项。有个农业生产合作社在年终分配时，不经社员同意，即扣除信用社股金旧币二千多万元，供销社股金旧币一千三百多万元，公债旧币七百多万元，农贷旧币一亿二千多万元（包括社的和社员个人的），四项共计旧币一亿六千多万元，占社员口粮以外的各种收入的百分之七十五。这就影响了社内生产投资，社员生活也感到极大不便。
    发动农民把余款存入信用社或购买公债，本来是对农民有好处的。但这些经济措施必须和政治工作相配合，必须发动和教育农民，使他们自觉缴纳，自愿认购。采取强迫命令、干部指定的办法，必然会脱离群众。至于偿还农业贷款，虽和信用社入股、认购公债等有所不同，也应向农民和社员作动员教育工作，争取他们尽力偿还，简单的扣除是不好的。
    农业生产合作社在社员同意的原则下统一办理一些经济工作，本来是可以的；如果处理得当，对社的巩固还有好处。但不顾社的具体情况，不经社员自愿，就强行统一办理，也会脱离群众造成不良影响。这种现象在其他地区也发生过。社员说：社“管的太宽了”！当然，这对社的巩固是不利的。
