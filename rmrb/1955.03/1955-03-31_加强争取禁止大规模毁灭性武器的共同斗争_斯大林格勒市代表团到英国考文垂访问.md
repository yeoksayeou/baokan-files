Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from TASS: The Stalingrad Soviet delegation, invited by the Coventry Municipal Council of England, arrived in Coventry on the 25th for a visit to England.

On the 26th, at a reception held by the Mayor of Coventry, John Finer, the head of the Stalingrad delegation, Sharapov, Chairman of the Stalingrad City Soviet Executive Committee, recalled the appeals from the cities of Coventry and Stalingrad to the United Nations demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and expressed his firm belief that the delegation's visit to Coventry would further strengthen the common struggle to ban weapons of mass destruction.

On the 27th, the delegation laid a wreath at the cemetery for victims of fascist air raids. In his speech, Sharapov called on people to be vigilant against plans to revive German militarism, and to remain faithful to those who sacrificed themselves in the struggle against German militarism. The Mayor of Coventry emphasized that the solidarity between the cities of Coventry and Stalingrad was formed during the years of fighting against the common enemy—German fascism. He said: We must maintain and strengthen this solidarity, and persevere in the common struggle to ban atomic weapons.

Note: The Coventry Municipal Council, which suffered cruel air raids by fascist Germany during World War II, initiated a joint appeal with the Stalingrad City Soviet to the United Nations in June 1954, calling for a ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons. At the end of October of the same year, the Stalingrad City Soviet invited a delegation from the Coventry Municipal Council to visit the Soviet Union and signed a joint appeal.

    加强争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器的共同斗争
    斯大林格勒市代表团到英国考文垂访问
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社讯：应英国考文垂市政委员会邀请到英国访问的斯大林格勒市苏维埃代表团二十五日到达考文垂。
    二十六日，在考文垂市市长约翰·菲纳尔举行的招待会上，斯大林格勒代表团团长、斯大林格勒市苏维埃执行委员会主席夏普罗夫追述了考文垂和斯大林格勒两个城市向联合国提出的要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的呼吁书，并且表示深信：代表团此来访问考文垂，将进一步加强争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器的共同斗争。
    二十七日，代表团向法西斯空袭受害人公墓献花圈。夏普罗夫在致词中要求人们警惕复活德国军国主义的计划，并且忠于在反对德国军国主义斗争中牺牲的人们。考文垂市市长强调指出：考文垂和斯大林格勒两个城市的团结是在反对共同的敌人——德国法西斯——的年代中形成的。他说：我们一定要保持和加强这种团结，并且要坚持不渝地进行禁止原子武器的共同斗争。
    按：在第二次世界大战中受过法西斯德国残酷空袭的考文垂市的市政委员会，曾在一九五四年六月倡议同斯大林格勒市苏维埃联合向联合国呼吁禁用原子武器和氢武器。同年十月底，斯大林格勒市苏维埃邀请了考文垂市政委员会代表团去苏联访问，并签署了联合呼吁书。
