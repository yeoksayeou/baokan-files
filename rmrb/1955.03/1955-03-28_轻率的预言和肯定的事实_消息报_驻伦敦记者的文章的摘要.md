Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th: TASS reports: "Izvestia's" London correspondent, Matveyev, published an article entitled "Hasty Predictions and Definite Facts."

    Matveyev said: The United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee will continue. However, reports recently published in American and Western European newspapers predict that the subcommittee's discussions will soon end. This kind of affirmation is a prediction instigated by those with ill intentions, exposing the real intentions of some Western figures who are eager to quickly end the meeting by declaring it has reached a "deadlock." Excuses are now being prepared to sabotage the meeting.
    Some newspapers have published ulterior motives about the talks, with the aim of portraying the Soviet attitude as some kind of "obstacle" hindering the talks, although not even a single bourgeois newspaper commentator dares to briefly review the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the subcommittee. These proposals have been wantonly slandered and vilified, all dismissed as "propaganda" or suggestions that "contain nothing new." However, the Soviet proposals clearly state that international supervision of the implementation of unanimously agreed decisions is as important and necessary as making these decisions to reduce armaments and ban weapons of mass destruction. As always, the Soviet Union continues to propose establishing an appropriate international supervision system at all stages of disarmament.
    As a first step towards substantial reductions in armaments, armed forces, and military budgets, the Soviet Union proposed that all countries guarantee not to increase their armed forces and armaments beyond the level of January 1, 1955, nor to increase their military expenditures beyond the approved military expenditures for this year. Western countries oppose these proposals, as they are unwilling to stop the expansion of armaments. The ruling groups of Western countries have no intention whatsoever of ending the arms race. It is quite obvious that if the activities of arms dealers pursuing profits were to end, as advocated by the Soviet proposal, it would be incompatible with the calculations of Western governments.
    They are determined to prevent an agreement from being reached, so they have taken out the theory of "levels of armed forces and armaments," which they created as early as 1952, from the cold storage.
    What Western countries really want is not the reduction of armaments and armed forces, but a debate on what the "level" (that is, the quantity) of armed forces and armaments of each country should be. By adopting this attitude, Western countries are turning the problem of reducing armaments and armed forces upside down.
    Matveyev concluded: The "disarmament" advocated by the Western ruling groups is actually a continuation of their current policy of intensifying the arms race. Propaganda clamor and window-dressing methods, such as the recent appointment of Stassen as President Eisenhower's special assistant on "disarmament" issues, are used by senior officials in Washington and London to conceal their true intentions. However, any disguise by the advocates of the "policy of strength" cannot deceive the people of all countries. The people of all countries judge the policies of this or that government based on actions, not words. And the actions of the Western ruling groups themselves have already been able to explain everything. Those who oppose the reduction of armaments and oppose the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction cannot be friends of peace.

    轻率的预言和肯定的事实
    ——“消息报”驻伦敦记者的文章的摘要
   【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：“消息报”驻伦敦记者马特维耶夫发表了一篇文章，题目是“轻率的预言和肯定的事实”。
    马特维耶夫说：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会还要继续进行。但是，在美国和西欧的报纸近来发表的消息中却预言小组委员会的讨论不久即将结束。这种肯定是存心不良的人所指使的预言暴露了一些西方人士的真正打算，他们急于要用宣告会议已经陷入“僵局”的办法来尽速使会议结束。现在正在替破坏会议准备借口。
    一些报纸对会谈发表了别有用心的评论，目的是要把苏联的态度描绘成为妨碍会谈的某种
  “障碍”，虽然任何一个资产阶级报纸的评论员甚至不敢概略地回顾一下苏联在小组委员会上提出的建议。这些建议遭到恣意的诬蔑诽谤，一律被说成是“宣传”或者是“不包含任何新内容”的建议。然而，苏联建议明明白白地说，对实施一致同意的决定进行国际监督是同作出这些裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决定同样重要和必要的。同以往一样，苏联仍然建议在裁军的一切阶段建立一种适当的国际监督制度。
  作为走向大量削减军备、武装部队和军事预算的第一步，苏联建议各国保证不把它们的武装部队和军备增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，也不把它们的军事费用增加到超过已经批准的今年的军事费用的水平。西方国家反对这些建议，它们不愿意停止扩张军备。西方国家的统治集团是丝毫也不想结束军备竞赛的。十分明显，如果像苏联建议所主张的那样，那末就会使军火商追逐利润的活动告终，而这是同西方各国政府的盘算格格不入的。
    它们决心阻止达成协议，所以就从冷藏库中取出它们早在一九五二年就制造出来的“武装部队和军备水平”的理论。
    西方国家真正要的东西不是裁减军备和武装部队，而是关于每个国家的武装部队和军备的“水平”（也就是数量）应该如何的辩论。西方国家抱着这种态度，就是在把裁减军备和武装部队的问题本末倒置。
    马特维耶夫最后说：西方统治集团所主张的“裁军”实际上是继续他们现在的加紧军备竞赛的政策。宣传叫嚷以及如同最近任命史塔生为艾森豪威尔总统的“裁军”问题特别助理之类的装璜门面的手法，都被华盛顿和伦敦高级官员用来掩饰他们真正的意图。但是，“实力政策”的倡导者们的任何伪装都是欺骗不了各国人民的。各国人民是根据行动而不是言论来判断这个或者那个政府的政策的。而西方国家统治集团的行动本身已经能够说明一切。反对裁减军备、反对禁止大规模毁灭性武器的人不可能是和平的朋友。
