The "Second National Art Exhibition," sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Artists Association, officially opened on the 27th at the Soviet Exhibition Center outside Xizhimen in the capital. On the first day of the opening, more than 13,000 people visited the exhibition.

The holding of this exhibition is a major event in China's art circles. It will review the creative achievements of artists across the country over the past five years since the founding of the People's Republic, and openly solicit opinions from the general public, so that future art creations can better serve national construction.

A year ago, the Chinese Artists Association began preparing for this exhibition, widely soliciting works and mobilizing members to actively engage in creative activities. In July 1954, the Ministry of Culture also notified the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities to mobilize their affiliated art institutions to organize creations and assist local artists associations in organizing work viewings and selection work.

During the preparation period for the exhibition, it received enthusiastic support from art groups, art institutions, and artists across the country. A total of more than 4,000 art works of various kinds were received. Most of the works were selected after being exhibited or viewed locally, and the vast majority were newly created in the past two years. The Chinese Artists Association established a selection committee for the exhibition to carry out the selection work, and selected 996 works (a set of comic strips counts as one piece) for the current exhibition, including 214 color ink paintings (i.e., traditional Chinese paintings), 130 oil paintings, 90 sculptures, 117 prints, 91 New Year pictures, 33 comic strips, 51 posters, 94 cartoons, 40 illustrations, 85 watercolors, and 51 sketches and quick sketches. The exhibiting areas include 36 provinces and cities, as well as the art work units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; in addition to members of the Artists Association, there are also many young art workers and some folk artists, expanding the art ranks.

Judging from the works in the exhibition, the subject matter has been enriched due to the artists' participation in social reforms and struggles. Many works reflect the face of national economic construction, the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and liberate Taiwan, and China's various social reforms. It is especially gratifying that many color ink paintings (i.e., traditional Chinese paintings) have depicted realistic life themes. Oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and illustrations, which were less created in the past, have also greatly increased due to social needs and promotion. It can be clearly seen from the exhibition that the styles of art works have become more diverse, and artistic techniques have also improved. This is the result of the Party and the government's concern for art and the artists' efforts in artistic practice over the past five years.

The exhibition venue occupies four spacious halls and two additional exhibition rooms in the Culture Pavilion of the Soviet Exhibition Center. Before the official opening, there were three consecutive days of pre-exhibitions from the 24th to the 26th, receiving foreign guests, responsible cadres of relevant units, and people from literary and artistic circles and news reporters. More than 3,200 people were invited to visit during the three days.

This exhibition is scheduled to close on May 10th. After the closing, all the exhibits will be transported to six major cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang, for a tour exhibition.

    第二届全国美术展览会在京开幕
    中华人民共和国文化部、中国美术家协会主办的“第二届全国美术展览会”，二十七日在首都西直门外苏联展览馆正式开幕。在开幕第一天，有一万三千多人参观了展览会。
    这个展览会的举行，是我国美术界的一件大事，它将检阅建国五年多以来全国美术家们的创作成绩，并公开听取广大群众的意见，使得今后的美术创作更好地为国家建设服务。
    一年以前，中国美术家协会即开始了这次展览会的筹备工作，普遍地征集作品，动员会员们积极展开创作活动。文化部于一九五四年七月间，还通知各省、市文化局发动所属美术事业机构组织创作、协助各地美术家协会进行组织作品观摩和评选工作。
    展览会筹备期间，获得全国各地美术团体、美术事业机构和美术家的热烈支持，共收到各种美术作品四千多件，大部分的作品是先在当地展览或观摩之后评选出来的，绝大多数是最近两年中的新创作。中国美术家协会为展览会设立了评选委员会，进行评选工作，选出了现在展出的九百九十六件（连环画一套作一件）作品，计彩墨画（即国画）二百十四件，油画一百三十件，雕塑九十件，版画一百十七件，年画九十一件，连环画三十三件，招贴画五十一件，漫画九十四件，插图四十件，水彩画八十五件，素描、速写五十一件。出品的地区包括三十六个省、市，以及中国人民解放军的各美术工作单位；作者除美术家协会会员以外，还有许多青年美术工作者和一部分民间艺人，美术的队伍扩大了。
    从展览会的作品来看，由于画家参加了社会的改革和斗争，题材丰富了，许多作品反映了国家经济建设的面貌，反映了抗美援朝和解放台湾的斗争，反映了我国的各项社会改革。尤其可喜的是许多彩墨画（即国画）都表现了现实生活的题材。过去创作较少的油画、雕塑、水彩画和插图，由于社会的需要和提倡，也大大增多。从展览会中可以明显地看出，美术作品的风格多样了，艺术技巧也有所提高。这是五年来党和政府对美术事业的关怀和美术家们努力艺术实践的结果。
    展览会的会场占了苏联展览馆文化馆四间宽敞的大厅和另外两间展览室。在正式开幕以前，从二十四日到二十六日，曾连续举行了三天的预展，招待外宾、有关单位负责干部、文艺界和新闻记者。三天中应邀前往参观的有三千二百多人。
    这次展览，预定到五月十日闭幕。闭幕以后，还要把全部展品运往上海、广州、武汉、重庆、西安、沈阳等六大城市巡回展览。
