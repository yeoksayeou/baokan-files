    Strange Epidemic
    Kǒng Sāng
    In the past two years, a strange epidemic of liking glazed-tile roofs has occurred in some cities. Many offices, guesthouses, dormitories, schools, and clubs have been capped with green hats consisting of "flying eaves" extending around the perimeter and supported by "brackets." It is said that this is called "national form." Many architects are keen on designing this kind of "national form," and many construction units love this kind of "national form" and insist on it.

    Of course, no one opposes national form. Chairman Mao said: "Chinese culture should have its own form, and that is national form." However, if we "uncritically absorb" ancient culture, to the point of violating the interests of national industrialization, it is not the "national form" that we want to promote. The reason why people call glazed-tile roofs a "disease" lies in this.

    Someone calculated the cost of glazed-tile roofs: compared with ordinary roofs, the cost of glazed-tile roofs is three or four times more expensive per square meter. Beijing has built nearly one million square meters of large roofs in the past few years. If they were converted to flat roofs or ordinary cement tile pitched roofs, about six million yuan could be saved. The kitchen and laundry room of a sanatorium is a single-story building, but because it used a glazed-tile roof, the cost per square meter was as high as 310 yuan. The office building of the State Planning Commission and other agencies was designed as a city gate tower-style large roof, which cost more than 400,000 yuan more than an ordinary roof.

    The roof is heavy and large, but its use is still the same as an ordinary roof. It cannot be lived on or worked on. Therefore, people cannot help but ask: Why can't we spend less money on the roof and use it to build more factories? At least the money wasted on the roof should be used to build more houses. Now we don't have too many houses, but not enough. Even in Beijing, there are still many workers, staff members, and college students who have to sleep on bunk beds, and many travelers cannot find hotels to stay in!

    It is said that people who advocate building this kind of glazed-tile roof have a "theory." They say: More people look at a building than live in it, and the architect's task is to serve the people spiritually. Therefore, for the sake of beauty and to decorate the city, glazed-tile roofs are necessary. However, architects have forgotten another more urgent task: to enable more people to live in houses, that is, to forget the principles of practicality and economy. Building houses mainly for people to look at (beauty and decorating the city), rather than mainly for people to live in, this kind of "spiritual service to the people" will precisely harm the interests of the people.

    The penchant for glazed-tile roofs should be abandoned. If we let it continue to spread, not only will many people who could have lived in new houses not be able to get houses, but also dozens of factories may be buried under glazed-tile roofs.

    奇怪的流行病
    孔桑
    近两年来，在一些城市里发生了一种喜欢盖琉璃瓦大屋顶的流行病。不少办公室、招待所、宿舍、学校和俱乐部都戴上了四周伸展出“飞檐”，下面支撑着“斗拱”的绿帽子。据说，这叫做“民族形式”。有许多建筑师热中于设计这种“民族形式”；也有许多建设单位热爱这种“民族形式”，非要如此不可。
    民族形式，当然没有人反对。毛主席说过：“中国文化应有自己的形式，这就是民族形式。”但是，如果对古代文化“无批判地兼收并蓄”，以至违背了国家工业化的利益，就不是我们所要提倡的“民族形式”了。人们所以把琉璃瓦大屋顶叫做“病”，原因即在于此。
    有人给琉璃瓦大屋顶算了一笔账：同普通的屋顶相比，每平方公尺琉璃瓦大屋顶的造价要贵三、四倍。北京这几年一共盖了将近一百万平方公尺的大屋顶，如果改做平顶或普通水泥瓦的坡顶，可以节省六百万元左右。有一个疗养院的厨房和洗衣房是一层平房，因为用了琉璃瓦大屋顶，每平方公尺的造价高达三百一十元。国家计划委员会等机关的办公大楼，设计成城门楼式的大屋顶，比普通屋顶多花了四十多万元。
    屋顶重而大，但用处仍然和普通屋顶一样，上面既不能住人，又不能工作。因此，人们不禁要问：为什么不能在屋顶上少花些钱，用来多盖一些工厂呢？至少也应该把在屋顶上浪费的钱用来多盖些房子。现在我们的房子不是太多，而是不够。就在北京，还有不少工人、职员和大学生要睡双层铺，有不少旅客找不到旅馆住！
    据说，主张盖这种琉璃瓦大屋顶的人有一种“理论”。他们说：盖一所房子，看的人比住的人多，建筑师的任务是要在精神上为人民服务。因此，为了美，为了装饰城市，琉璃瓦屋顶是必要的。但是，建筑师们忘记了另一个目前更迫切的任务：使更多的人住上房子，也就是忘记了适用和经济的原则。盖房子主要是为了给人看（美和装饰城市），而不是主要为了给人住，这种“精神上为人民服务”，恰恰会损害了人民的利益。
    对琉璃瓦大屋顶的癖好应该戒除了。如果我们让它继续流传下去，将不只使许多本来能住到新房子的人得不到房子住，而且可能使几十座工厂被埋葬在琉璃瓦屋顶下面。
