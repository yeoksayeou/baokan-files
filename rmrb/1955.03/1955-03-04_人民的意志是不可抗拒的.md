The Will of the People is Irresistible
Jiang Yuanchun

While the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee was at work in London, British Prime Minister Churchill, on March 1, delivered a lengthy speech in the House of Commons, vigorously engaging in atomic intimidation, touting the power of hydrogen bombs, and advocating a nuclear arms race.

As everyone knows, the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee is working according to the five-power joint proposal of Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which was adopted by the Ninth United Nations General Assembly. This proposal stipulates that the Subcommittee should discuss "the complete prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and any weapons of mass destruction, and the transfer of existing atomic stockpiles to peaceful uses." Now, while the Subcommittee is carrying out this discussion, Churchill, as the Prime Minister of the host country, is openly using hydrogen bomb rhetoric to intimidate, making it difficult to believe that Churchill is sincere on the issue of disarmament.

The long-term failure to resolve the disarmament issue, which is related to world peace, is inseparable from Britain's consistent support for the United States' destructive strategy. After the Ninth United Nations General Assembly adopted the five-power joint proposal on disarmament, even the "New York Times" could not help but acknowledge that "this is a major step forward." In order to promote the work of this disarmament subcommittee meeting in the spirit that the joint proposal should have, the Soviet government issued a statement on February 18, suggesting the complete destruction of all atomic and hydrogen weapons stockpiled by various countries, so that atomic materials can only be used for peaceful purposes. The Soviet government also suggested that countries should not increase the size of their armed forces and armaments beyond the levels of January 1, 1955, and that appropriate international supervision should be established. The Soviet proposal has been welcomed and supported by all peace-loving people, and will undoubtedly contribute to the resolution of the disarmament issue. Obviously, if the governments concerned are sincere on the issue of disarmament, then the possibility of reaching an agreement on the basis of the joint proposal and the Soviet suggestions exists.

But, what is the British Prime Minister's attitude?

Although Churchill admitted that, at a time when hydrogen bombs threaten the peace and security of the people of all countries, the problem facing Britain is: "What should we do? Where should we flee for our lives?" Although he also said that "a real system of universal disarmament is the solution to our difficulties," he not only did not put forward any positive opinions on the disarmament issue in his entire speech, but also did not express any support for the Soviet Union's proposal to destroy all existing atomic and hydrogen weapons. On the contrary, despite the Soviet Union's consistent advocacy of banning atomic weapons and implementing effective international supervision, he insisted that the Soviet Union was unwilling to accept international inspection. Despite the fact that peace-loving people around the world are signing petitions calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons, he indicated that nuclear weapons and conventional weapons can only be treated the same and reduced, which is actually opposing the prohibition and destruction of all nuclear weapons.

Not only that, he is also making every effort to promote the accelerated production of hydrogen bombs, clamoring about "deterrence through defense." It is not difficult to see that Churchill's so-called policy of "deterrence through defense" is just another way of saying the so-called "policy of strength" of the US-British bloc. Everyone knows that this long-bankrupt "policy of strength" is to use force to compel others to submit to one's will. Churchill's clamoring for a "policy of strength" backed by hydrogen bombs while the disarmament issue is being discussed is clearly aimed at exerting pressure on the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting with atomic intimidation, vainly attempting to force others to act according to the one-sided plans of the United States and Britain on the disarmament issue. This is actually to ensure that the disarmament issue continues to remain unresolved.

In order to carry out atomic intimidation, Churchill also vigorously touted the illusory "superiority" of the United States in hydrogen bombs. He tried to make people believe that the United States "far exceeds other countries and ranks first" in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The United States "has an absolute advantage in nuclear weapons." To prove this point, Churchill even went so far as to describe Britain as a country that "relies mainly on their [the United States'] protection."

However, as far as people know, the United States strictly blocks atomic intelligence from Britain, and Britain is struggling to break this blockade but cannot. So, why should Churchill play the hero and insist that he knows about the so-called "nuclear superiority" of the United States? And why should he pretend to know more about the Soviet Union's affairs than the Soviets themselves, making unfounded comments about the Soviet Union's nuclear power? Obviously, Churchill's shouting about the United States' "nuclear superiority" is a deception aimed at threatening the people of Europe.

Churchill also made blatant war cries. In his speech, he openly said that if a war breaks out, "there are many targets," including the Soviet Union's "dozens of airfields," "which we and the Americans must be able to attack immediately." He also said that "the vast administrative and industrial targets of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, the Soviet submarine bases and other naval targets must be given early attention." To make this war threat seem particularly frightening, Churchill also promoted that hydrogen bombs are "effective" for countries like the Soviet Union, "whose residents are still scattered over a vast area."

However, assuming that the person making such wild remarks still has some sanity, then he must know that these words can only frighten themselves. Because hydrogen bombs would only be even more "effective" for a country like Britain, whose residents are concentrated in a small area.

Churchill's "policy of strength" backed by hydrogen bombs cannot scare people. His following the United States in clamoring for a hydrogen bomb war only exposes his violation of the will and interests of the British people, and his willingness to treat Britain as a base for American atomic bombers. He attempts to use such rhetoric to force the British people to feel that nuclear war is inevitable, and then leave their fate to the atomic fanatics to control.

But the British people will not allow Churchill to throw them into an atomic war. The British people, realizing the huge danger of atomic war to Britain, are increasingly opposing the use of atomic weapons and opposing the manufacture of hydrogen bombs. One hundred and two organizations in Manchester, including many trade union organizations, passed a resolution at a peace conference held on February 27 saying, "Because we recognize how vulnerable our country is to attack in the event of an atomic war, we note with alarm the British government's decision to manufacture thermonuclear weapons." They also called for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. British Labor Party leader Attlee also said on February 19 that it "is foolish" for the British government to spend large sums of money on the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.

The demand for the prohibition of nuclear weapons is the will of the British people, and it is also the will of peace-loving people all over the world. The British Prime Minister should understand in time that the will of the people is irresistible.

    人民的意志是不可抗拒的
    蒋元椿
    正当联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦进行工作的时候，英国首相邱吉尔却在三月一日在下院中长篇大论地极力进行原子恐吓，叫嚣氢弹威力，鼓吹核子武器竞赛。
    大家知道，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会是按照第九届联合国大会通过的加拿大、法国、苏联、美国、英国的五国联合提案进行工作的。这个提案中规定小组委员会应当讨论“完全禁止使用和制造核子武器和任何大规模屠杀武器，把现有的原子储存移用于和平用途”。现在，邱吉尔作为一个东道国的首相，却乘小组委员会正在进行这项讨论工作的时候，公开以氢弹叫嚣来进行恫吓，这就很难使人认为邱吉尔在裁军问题上具有诚意。
    关系世界和平的裁军问题长期不能解决，这和英国一贯支持美国的破坏策略是分不开的。第九届联合国大会通过关于裁军问题的五国联合提案后，甚至“纽约时报”也不能不认为“这是向前迈进了很大的一步”。为了促使这次裁军小组委员会会议能够按照联合提案的应有精神来进行工作，苏联政府在二月十八日发表声明，建议完全销毁各国现在储存的原子武器和氢武器，使原子原料只能用于和平用途。苏联政府并建议各国不得使自己的武装部队和军备的数量增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，建立适当的国际监督。苏联的建议得到一切爱好和平的人民的欢迎和支持，无疑地有助于裁军问题的解决。很明显，如果有关各国政府在裁军问题上具有诚意，那末在联合提案和苏联建议的基础上达成协议的可能是存在的。
    可是，英国首相的态度怎样呢？
    邱吉尔虽然承认，在目前氢弹威胁着各国人民的和平和安全的时候，英国所面临的问题是：“我们该怎么办？我们该往哪里去逃命？”他虽然也说，“真正的普遍裁军制度是解决我们的困难的办法”，但是他在通篇发言中，却不但完全没有对裁军问题提出任何积极的意见，而且对苏联关于销毁一切现存的原子武器和氢武器的建议根本不表示任何支持。相反，尽管苏联一贯主张禁止原子武器并实行有效的国际监督，但他却硬说苏联不愿接受国际监察。尽管世界爱好和平人民正在签名要求禁止原子武器，他却表示核子武器和常规武器只能一样对待，进行裁减，这实际上就是反对禁止和销毁一切核子武器。
    不但如此，他还在竭力鼓吹加紧制造氢弹，叫嚣什么“寓防御于阻遏”。不难看出，邱吉尔的所谓“寓防御于阻遏”的政策，不过是美英集团的所谓“实力政策”的另一种说法。谁都晓得这个早已破产的“实力政策”，就是要以武力来迫使别人屈从自己的意志。邱吉尔在裁军问题正在进行讨论的时候来叫嚣以氢弹为后盾的“实力政策”，其目的显然是要用原子恐吓来对裁军小组委员会会议施加压力，妄想迫使别人按照美国和英国在裁军问题上的片面打算办事。这实际上就是要使裁军问题继续得不到解决。
    为了进行原子恫吓，邱吉尔还竭力吹嘘美国在氢弹方面的虚幻“优势”。他企图使人相信，美国在制造核子武器方面“大大超过其他国家而居于首位”。美国“在核子武器方面占有绝大的优势”。为了证明这一点，邱吉尔甚至不惜把英国说成是一个“主要依赖他们（美国）的保护”的国家。
    但是，就人们所知，美国对英国严格封锁原子情报，英国争着要打破这种封锁却办不到。那么，邱吉尔何必充好汉，硬说他知道美国的所谓“核子优势”呢？他又何苦装成比苏联人知道苏联的事情还多，对苏联的核子威力发表毫无根据的意见。显然，邱吉尔叫嚷美国的“核子优势”，是为了威胁欧洲人民，是一种自欺欺人的勾当。
    邱吉尔还作了露骨的战争叫嚣。他在发言中公然说，如果发生战争，“有许多目标”，包括苏联的“几十个飞机场”，“是我们和美国人必须能够立即攻击的”。他还说，对于苏联和各人民民主国家的“巨大的行政和工业目标、苏联的潜水艇基地和其他海军目标必需及早予以注意”。为了使这种战争威胁显得十分怕人，邱吉尔还宣传氢弹对于像苏联这样“居民迄今分散在广大的地面”的国家是“有效力”的。
    但是，假定发这种狂言的人还有理智的话，那么，他一定知道这些话只能吓倒他们自己。因为氢弹对于一个居民集中在狭小地面上的国家像英国只会是更加“有效力”的。
    邱吉尔的以氢弹为后盾的“实力政策”是吓不倒人的。他追随美国叫嚣氢弹战争，只是暴露了他违背英国人民的意志和英国的利益，甘心情愿地把英国当作美国的原子轰炸机的基地。他企图用这样的叫嚣来迫使英国人民觉得核子战争不可避免，于是把他们的命运听任原子狂人们去摆布。
    但是英国人民是不会容许邱吉尔把他们投入一场原子战争的。英国人民认识到原子战争对于英国的巨大危险，正在越来越多地反对使用原子武器反对制造氢弹。曼彻斯特的一百零二个组织，其中包括许多工会组织，在二月二十七日举行的一次和平会议上通过一项决议说，“由于我们认识到一旦发生原子战争时我们国家处于多么容易遭受攻击的地位，所以我们怀着惊慌的心情注意到英国政府关于制造热核子武器的决定。”它们还要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器。英国工党领袖艾德礼也在二月十九日说，英国政府把大笔的钱花在制造氢弹上“是愚蠢的事”。
    要求禁止核子武器，这就是英国人民的意志，也是全世界爱好和平的人民的意志。英国首相应当及时了解，人民的意志是不可抗拒的。
