    Jiaohe Fruit Tree Nursery Cultivates Cold-Resistant Varieties
    The staff of the Jiaohe County Local State-Run Fruit Tree Nursery in Jilin Province have cultivated a large number of cold-resistant, high-quality fruit tree seedlings to supply the needs of farmers. Jiaohe County is a mountainous area suitable for planting fruit trees, but due to the cold climate, imported fruit tree seedlings do not easily grow. In 1953, in response to the demands of farmers, a state-run fruit tree nursery was established to cultivate cold-resistant varieties. From its establishment to this spring, the nursery has supplied farmers with more than 15,000 fruit tree seedlings of various types. It is estimated that this year, it can cultivate more than 100,000 pear, apple, and other fruit tree seedlings to supply the needs of farmers. At the same time, the nursery leadership also regularly sends technicians to the countryside to teach farmers cultivation techniques. Therefore, the survival rate of fruit tree seedlings generally reaches over 80 percent. This year, they also plan to recruit a group of senior elementary school graduates from agricultural production cooperatives for internships at the nursery.

    蛟河果树繁殖场培植耐寒品种
    吉林省蛟河县地方国营果树繁殖场职工培植了大批耐寒优良品种果树苗，供应农民需要。蛟河县是个山区，适宜种植果树，但因气候寒冷，外来果树苗不易生长。一九五三年，根据农民的要求，成立了国营果树繁殖场培植耐寒品种。该场自成立到今春，已供应农民各种果树苗一万五千多株，估计今年还可培植出十万多株梨、苹果等果树苗供应农民需要。同时，该场领导上还经常派技术员下乡向农民传授栽培技术，因此，果树苗的成活率一般可达到百分之八十以上。今年还准备吸收一批农业生产合作社的高小毕业生到场内实习。
