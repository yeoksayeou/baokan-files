Xinhua News Agency, Saratov, March 20th: According to TASS, the conference of agricultural workers from the southeastern regions of the Soviet Union, convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), was held in Saratov on the 17th and 18th. The conference discussed the tasks of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in these regions to increase agricultural and livestock production. A total of 1,200 people participated in the conference.

    Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, attended the conference.

    P. Lobanov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, delivered a report at the conference on "Increasing Agricultural Production and Increasing the Supply of Agricultural Products to the State by Collective Farms and State Farms in the Southeast."

    In his report, Lobanov said that the southeastern regions should play a significant role in the struggle to implement the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee's January Plenum on increasing livestock production. The southeastern region currently produces large quantities of spring wheat and millet, and hundreds of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms have achieved good results in increasing crop yields per unit area and livestock productivity. However, on the whole, the southeastern region has not fully utilized its potential in agricultural and livestock production and has not produced enough grain and livestock products.

    In discussing the task of further expanding grain production, Lobanov particularly emphasized the issue of expanding the production of corn, millet, and durum wheat in the southeast. He believes that it is entirely possible for the southeastern regions to increase the corn planting area from 55,000 hectares last year to at least 1 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) this year. To increase grain production, it is necessary to successfully complete the state-mandated task of reclaiming wasteland.

    Lobanov's report addressed the tasks and measures for increasing livestock production and increasing the supply of livestock products to the state.

    Lobanov also analyzed the work of machine tractor stations and state farms in the southeastern regions. Finally, he emphasized the need to take measures to expand the production of commodity agricultural products and increase the supply of agricultural products to the state.

    The conference launched a discussion on Lobanov's report. Speakers at the two-day conference unanimously agreed that agricultural workers in the southeast have the potential to increase agricultural production and transform the southeast into a rich granary and a solid base for Soviet livestock farming. In addition, they also discussed experiences in agricultural and livestock production.

    Nikita Khrushchev delivered a long speech at the conference on the 18th. His speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

    The conference unanimously adopted a letter to all agricultural workers in the southeastern regions, calling on them to participate in the socialist competition to increase agricultural production and increase the supply of agricultural products to the state.

    苏共中央召开东南部各州农业工作者会议
    洛巴诺夫作增产农产品和增加对国家农产品供应的报告
   【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社萨拉托夫讯：苏联共产党中央委员会召开的苏联东南部各州农业工作者会议，十七日和十八日在萨拉托夫举行。会议讨论了这些地区的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场增加农业和畜牧业生产的任务。参加会议的共有一千二百人。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫参加了会议。
    苏联部长会议副主席帕·洛巴诺夫在会上作了“关于东南部集体农庄和国营农场增加农产品生产和增加对国家的农产品供应”的报告。
    洛巴诺夫在报告中说，在执行苏共中央一月全会关于增加畜牧业产品生产的决议的斗争中，东南部各州应当发挥巨大的作用。东南部地区目前出产大量的春小麦和黍，数以百计的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场在提高农作物单位面积产量和畜产品生产率方面已经获得了良好的成就。但是，整个说来，东南部地区还没有充分利用农牧业生产方面的潜力，没有生产出足够的谷物和畜产品。
    在谈到进一步扩大谷物生产的任务时，洛巴诺夫特别强调在东南部各地扩大玉蜀黍、黍和硬粒小麦生产的问题。他认为，东南部各州今年完全有可能至少把玉蜀黍的播种面积从去年的五万五千公顷扩大到一百万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。为了增加谷物生产，必须胜利地完成国家规定的开垦荒地的任务。
    洛巴诺夫的报告谈到了增加畜产品生产、增加对国家的畜产品供应量的任务和措施。
    洛巴诺夫还分析了东南部各州机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作。最后，他着重指出必须采取措施来扩大商品农产品的生产和增加对国家的农产品供应量。
    会议就洛巴诺夫的报告展开了讨论。在两天会议上发言的人一致认为，东南部的农业劳动者完全有可能增加农产品的生产，并且把东南部地区变成富饶的谷仓和苏联畜牧业的巩固基地。此外，他们还谈到了农业和畜牧业生产的经验。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在十八日的会议上作了长篇的讲话。他的讲话受到全场的热烈欢迎。
    会议一致通过了致东南部各州全体农业劳动者书，号召他们参加争取增加农产品生产和增加对国家的农产品供应量的社会主义竞赛。
