    The Korean Armistice Agreement Must Be Upheld
    Cui Qi
    On March 13th, officials in Washington revealed that the United States in Korea "could take a step" to "quietly discard the provision in the armistice agreement that prohibits the introduction of new weapons into South Korea," and that is, "abandon the armistice agreement and begin to strengthen the South Korean army" (United Press International dispatch).
    On March 15th, Dulles blatantly stated that the Syngman Rhee group could take any action to provoke China without any restrictions.
    The United States not only made these bellicose remarks, but also frequently advocated the idea of a three-pronged attack on China from South Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. The US plot to tear up the armistice agreement, undermine peace in Korea, and prepare for a new war is all too obvious.
    In order to justify this blatant act of sabotage of the armistice agreement, Washington officials insisted that the Korean-Chinese side had been "violating" the armistice agreement from the beginning. However, all reports submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) have proven that the Korean-Chinese side has strictly abided by all provisions of the armistice agreement. At the request of the United States, the NNSC inspection teams recently conducted on-site investigations at various ports in North Korea and proved that the slanderous accusations were completely unfounded.
    It is precisely the United States that has been violating the armistice agreement from the very beginning. The report published by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC on April 30, 1954, revealed with evidence the various illegal acts of the United States in transporting large quantities of reinforcement weapons and military supplies into South Korea.
    For more than a year, in order to freely violate the armistice agreement and massively expand the Syngman Rhee army, the United States has used various despicable means to attempt to abolish the NNSC. Not long ago, it also submitted a memorandum to the Swedish government, openly advocating the abolition of the NNSC. In order to echo the intentions of the United States, the Syngman Rhee group also brazenly rejected the suggestion made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strengthen peace in Korea: to reduce the armed forces of both the North and the South to a level of 100,000 men; and it clamored against the "shackles" of the armistice. This is of course related to the instigation of the United States.
    Peace in Korea is facing an increasingly serious threat from the United States. Under this situation, maintaining the NNSC and upholding the Korean Armistice Agreement is of course the responsibility of all countries related to the Korean armistice, and it is also the firm position of the Korean-Chinese side. However, the British Information Services, which often expresses its concern for peace, has put forward a bizarre argument in its recent commentary. The commentary argued that since the Korean-Chinese side has accused the United Nations Command of violating the armistice agreement, it proves that the NNSC is useless and should be abolished.
    Here, the British Information Services deliberately evaded a question: Which is more conducive to stabilizing the Korean armistice and peace in Korea, abolishing the NNSC, or maintaining it?
    Some countries have made the correct answer to this question.
    A United Press International dispatch on March 13th said that when the United States submitted its "proposal" to abolish the NNSC to the other fifteen countries in the Korean War, several countries were unwilling to express their opinions "because they were concerned that abolishing the committee would only lead to a greatly public strengthening of military forces and the resurgence of war."
    The war plot of the American warmongers to tear up the Korean Armistice Agreement must not be allowed. Peace-loving people must uphold the armistice agreement and defend peace.

    一定要维护朝鲜停战协定
    崔奇
    三月十三日，华盛顿的官员透露说：美国在朝鲜“可以采取一个步骤”，“把停战协定中禁止把新式武器运入南朝鲜的规定悄悄地抛在一边”，“那就是，放弃停战协定而开始加强南朝鲜军”（合众社电）。
    三月十五日，杜勒斯又露骨地表示，李承晚集团可以不受任何限制地采取任何行动向中国挑衅。
    美国不仅发表这些好战言论，而且经常宣扬从南朝鲜、台湾和东南亚对中国三面作战的主张。美国企图撕毁停战协定、破坏朝鲜和平、准备新战争的阴谋是再明显没有了。
    为了替美国计划中这种明目张胆地破坏停战协定的罪恶行为辩护，华盛顿的官员们硬说，朝中方面从一开头就“破坏”了停战协定。可是，中立国监察委员会提出的所有报告都证明了朝中方面是严格遵守停战协定的各种规定的。在美方要求之下，中立国视察小组最近还曾经到北朝鲜各口岸作了实地的调查，证明诽谤者的指责是完全没有根据的。
    从一开头就破坏停战协定的恰恰就是美国。中立国监察委员会的波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员在一九五四年四月三十日公布的报告，就有凭有据地揭露了美方把大批增援性武器和军用物资运入南朝鲜的种种非法行为。
    一年多以来，为了要放手破坏停战协定，大量扩充李承晚军，美国用了各种卑劣手段，企图取消中立国监察委员会。前不久，它还向瑞典政府提出备忘录，公开主张把中立国监察委员会取消。为了附和美国的意图，李承晚集团还悍然拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面提出的加强朝鲜和平的建议：把南北双方的武装力量都裁减到十万人的水平；它并且叫嚣反对停战的“束缚”。这当然是和美国的策动有关的。
    朝鲜的和平已受到来自美国的日益严重的威胁。在这种形势之下，维护中立国监察委员会，维护朝鲜停战协定，当然是一切同朝鲜停战有关的国家的责任，同时这也是朝中方面的坚决主张。可是时常表示自己关心和平的英国新闻处在它最近的一篇评论中却提出了怪诞论点。这个评论争辩说，既然朝中方面指责联合国军方面有违反停战协定的事件，那就证明中立国监察委员会没有用处，所以应当把它取消。
    在这里，英国新闻处有意躲避了一个问题：究竟是取消中立国监察委员会对于稳定朝鲜停战、对于朝鲜和平有利呢？还是维护它才能对于和平和停战有利？
    这个问题，有些国家是作出了正确答案的。
    合众社三月十三日的电讯说，当美国把它要求取消中立国监察委员会的“建议”，交给侵略朝鲜战争中的其他十五个国家时，有几个国家就不愿表示意见，“因为它们担心撤销委员会只会引起大大公开的军事力量的加强和战争的再起”。
    美国好战者企图撕毁朝鲜停战协定的战争阴谋是决不能容许的。爱好和平人民一定要维护停战协定、保卫和平。
