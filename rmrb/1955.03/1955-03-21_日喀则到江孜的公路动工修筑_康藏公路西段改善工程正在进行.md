Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 19th: Construction of the highway from Xigaze to Gyangze in the Tibet region commenced on the 14th, starting northwards from Gyangze. That morning, the Tibetan laborers participating in the construction, carrying their tools, went to work singing songs all the way. When it was time to stop work, they even competed to dig a few more shovels of dirt. Staff members of the construction site supply station and medical clinic have already moved to the construction site. After the laborers arrived at the site, they immediately received their rations from the supply station.

The highway from Xigaze to Gyangze is over ninety kilometers long, with an average altitude of more than three thousand meters. The project is relatively simple and is expected to be roughly passable throughout the line this year. The construction of this highway is an important measure taken by the State Council to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people along the Nyang Chu River through work relief. According to the estimates of the road construction leadership, at least ten thousand disaster victims can rely on road construction to maintain their lives after the highway is fully under construction. During the busy farming season, the engineering department will also give holidays to allow the workers to return home for production.

Xigaze is the second largest city in Tibet. This highway will connect here with the Lhasa-Xigaze highway, which is about to begin construction. At that time, the three major cities of Tibet will be connected by highways.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 19th: Improvement work is underway on the western section of the Kangzang Highway. More than thirty kilometers of the road surface from Lhasa to Taizhao has been paved, and the workers are advancing eastward in sections. The seven or eight ice accumulation areas under the Gongbu Bala Mountain have been renovated. The foundation reinforcement project of several marshy sections can be completed before the spring thaw. Materials for more than thirty bridges to be built between Bomi and Lhasa have been prepared, and construction of some key bridges has begun. The foundation project of the shallow water section of the Lhasa River Bridge is expected to be completed before the upstream ice and snow melt at the end of March. Partial widening, drainage, and parapet wall construction have been completed for the quicksand sections and cliff-side roadbeds in the Bomi area.

    日喀则到江孜的公路动工修筑
    康藏公路西段改善工程正在进行
   【新华社拉萨十九日电】西藏地区日喀则到江孜的公路，已在十四日从江孜向北开始动工修筑。那天清早，参加施工的藏族民工，带着工具，一路上唱着歌去上工。临到收工，他们还争着多挖几锹土。工地供应站和医疗所的工作人员，都已搬到工地上。民工到达工地以后，立刻从供应站领到了口粮。
    日喀则到江孜的公路全长九十多公里，平均海拔三千多公尺，工程较为简易，预计今年就可全线粗通。这段公路的修建，是国务院以工代赈救济年楚河沿岸受灾人民的重要措施。据筑路领导机关的估计，到公路全面动工以后，至少有一万多灾民可以依靠修路维持生活。在农忙期间，工程部门还放假，让民工们回家生产。
    日喀则是西藏第二大城，这段公路将在这里和即将动工修建的拉萨到日喀则的公路相衔接，那时候，西藏的三大重要城市就被公路线联结在一起了。
    据新华社拉萨十九日电：康藏公路西段正在进行改善工程。拉萨到太昭段的路面已经铺筑了三十多公里，工人们正分段向东推进。工布巴拉山下的七、八处积冰地段，都已经过整修。几处泥沼地段的路基加固工程，在春季土地解冻以前就可完工。从波密到拉萨间要修筑的三十多座桥梁的材料已经准备好了，有些重点桥梁已动工修建。拉萨河大桥浅水部分的基础工程，预计在三月底上游冰雪溶化前就可完工。波密地区的流砂地段和傍崖的路基，已经完成了部分加宽、排水、包坎等工程。
