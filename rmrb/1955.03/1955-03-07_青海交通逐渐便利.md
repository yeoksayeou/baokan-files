Qinghai Province, due to its vast area and inconvenient transportation, in the past required newspapers and letters sent from Xining to Yushu to be routed through Xikang and other places, taking as long as two to three months. Since the opening of the Xining-to-Yushu section of the Qingkang Highway, and with the state-owned Qinghai Provincial Transportation Company adding regular bus services from Xining to Yushu and Xining to Gonghe starting in February, it has brought great convenience to the people along the highway. Now, passengers traveling from Xining to Yushu only need seven days; the transportation time for newspapers, letters, and daily necessities has also been greatly shortened. Passengers have commented: In the past, it took a month to travel from Xining to Yushu on horseback, and the road was difficult to travel, but now it is much more convenient.

    青海交通逐渐便利
    青海省因为地区辽阔，交通不便，过去从西宁寄到玉树的报纸和信件，要绕道西康等地，需时达两三个月。自青康公路西宁至玉树段通车，以及国营青海省运输公司从二月份起又增开西宁至玉树和西宁至共和等地的定期班车以后，已给公路沿线人民带来很大便利。现在从西宁到玉树去的旅客，只需七天时间；报纸、信件、日用品的运输时间也缩短了许多。旅客们反映说：从前自西宁去玉树，骑马得一个月，路上还难行走，现在便利多了。
