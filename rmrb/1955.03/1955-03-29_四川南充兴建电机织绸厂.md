In Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, which is rich in silk production, a motor-driven silk weaving factory, the largest in Southwest China, is under construction. The entire project includes both renovation and new construction. The renovation project will be completed in March; the design drawings for the new construction have been completed and construction will begin in June, with production expected to begin in the fourth quarter.

Once completed, the factory's silk production will be more than seven times that of the current Southwest Silk Company's spun silk factory. It will also produce large quantities of eleven new products, including Sichuan true silk quilt covers, satin, checkered textiles, plain crepe, and palis, all of which are famous at home and abroad.

The silk produced in Nanchong Prefecture accounts for one-half of the total in Sichuan Province. In the past, most of this silk had to be transported to Chongqing for weaving. Once this factory is officially put into production, the raw silk produced by the seven private silk reeling factories in Nanchong and Langzhong can be processed locally, reducing costs.

    四川南充兴建电机织绸厂
    在四川省盛产蚕丝的南充专区，正在兴建一座西南最大的电机织绸厂。这个厂全部工程包括改建和新建两部分。改建工程将在三月份完成；新建工程图样已设计完毕，将在六月份开始施工，第四季度就可投入生产。
    这座工厂建成后，丝绸生产量将比现在的西南蚕丝公司绢纺厂大七倍多，并将大量生产国内外驰名的四川真丝被面、爱斯缎、格子纺、素碧绉和派力司等十一种新产品。
    南充专区所生产的蚕丝占四川全省的二分之一。过去这些蚕丝大部要运到重庆去织绸。这个厂正式投入生产后，南充和阆中七家私营代缫厂缫出的生丝就能就近加工，成本可以降低。（新华社）
