    Resolution of the All-China Youth Federation on Preparing to Participate in the Fifth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship.
    The All-China Youth Federation warmly welcomes and supports the decision of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students to hold the Fifth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship in Warsaw from July 31st to August 14th this year.
    The World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship, with its fine traditions, has deeply penetrated the hearts of millions of young people around the world with different political views and religious beliefs. The various friendly meetings and rich and colorful cultural and artistic performances and sports activities held at previous festivals have greatly strengthened the understanding and friendship between young people from various countries and have made great contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace. This year's festival will be an even greater demonstration, showing the firm will and strength of our younger generation to defend peace and their own rights. It will further inspire young people from all countries to fight together with all people against atomic war and against the revival of German militarism.
    Chinese youth are excitedly looking forward to this year's festival and will greet this festival with even greater achievements in labor and study.
    The All-China Youth Federation calls on young musicians and artists to strive to create new songs and works of art; outstanding athletes across the country are stepping up preparations to participate in the festival's competitions. The activities of our delegation during the festival will further develop the friendship between our youth and the youth of other countries, and strengthen the forces for defending world peace.
