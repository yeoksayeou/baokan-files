Recently, the Second District of Yibin County, Sichuan Province, convened a meeting of the directors and production team leaders of all sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in the district, as well as some resident cadres, to review the spring plowing preparations. At the meeting, each cooperative reported on the specific problems and experiences in organizing labor and production. The situations of two cooperatives caught everyone's attention.

One was the Datu Cooperative, with a total of twenty-two households. The seedlings of the small spring crops were growing similarly to those in mutual aid teams, but there were still barren lands and missing seedlings, with spacing between holes and rows exceeding one foot. Work was done like the mutual aid teams, with daily scoring; the scoring standards varied among production teams, leading to mutual suspicion. The second production team did better work and often helped the first production team. However, the work points of the two teams were about the same. The cooperative's finances were chaotic, and farm tools were scattered and unmanaged; any member could buy whatever they wanted with the cooperative's money, without a necessary expenditure system. All three cooperative cadres were Party members, but they were not united. The members had opinions about the cooperative cadres, saying, "If we continue like this, production will decrease." The masses outside the cooperative also secretly mocked it. Because most of the members were poor and new middle peasants, and the cooperative cadres still wanted to run the cooperative well, the cooperative had not collapsed, nor had any members withdrawn.

The other was the Yangliutang Cooperative. The backbone members and members of this cooperative were exploring and trying out the method of "contracting" agricultural work. Judging from the content and nature of their "contracting," it was close to "contracting production to households." After discussion among the members, they adopted methods such as sowing rice seeds in fertile fields, improving water conservancy, plowing and harrowing dry fields three times for the small spring crops, and adjusting seedling fields to tap production potential and develop a spring production plan. They also planned to raise five hundred fish in the paddy fields, plant one thousand eight hundred tung trees on the mountains (which could be harvested in five years), and implement "grafting" on citrus trees (which could be harvested five years later). In addition, they planted a lot of medicinal herbs. By early January, they had accumulated more than 20,000 loads of fertilizer, averaging more than 25 loads of fertilizer per mu of field; if concentrated on barren land, each mu could have more than 40 loads. Currently, members are continuing to actively accumulate fertilizer. At the same time, they also organized the cooperative's surplus labor to weave grass mats.

Neither of these two cooperatives had resident cadres; they were run by the backbone members and members themselves. In the future, more and more cooperatives will be run by the masses themselves rather than by resident cadres. Due to the different strengths of the backbone members and the inconsistent work foundations, the emergence of such a wide disparity in performance is not surprising. The question is: what should the leadership do in this situation? Obviously, they should seriously summarize the experience of the Yangliutang Cooperative and promote it, and also help the Datu Cooperative improve its work, to gain experience in raising the backward to the general and advanced levels. However, the comrades of the District Committee did not do this. In the past, they did not fully understand the situation of the cooperatives in the district. After learning about the situation of the Datu and Yangliutang Cooperatives, they did not realize how they should carry out their work. Later, at the suggestion of Qin Junzhou, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, and several other cadres stationed in the old cooperatives, the Secretary of the District Committee decided to send cadres to the Yangliutang Cooperative to summarize their experience. As for the Datu Cooperative, he excused himself by saying that the district did not have enough cadres and did not want to send anyone.

Improving the District Committee's leadership level in the cooperative movement is an important issue in the current cooperative movement. Many District Committee comrades do not dislike running the cooperatives well, nor do they intentionally refuse to adopt good working methods; however, most District Committees are newly promoted, and they still lack the knowledge and experience to lead mass movements. Some of them only know that they should hold on to a few old cooperatives and ignore the discovery and support of new forces among the masses; they only know that they should run the good cooperatives well and disdain "wasting energy" in the poorly run cooperatives, not understanding that strengthening weak links has a significant role in promoting the overall situation. The Second District of Yibin County is a concrete example of this. How can we improve the leadership level of the District Committee? In addition to each District Committee member studying practical knowledge and studying theory and policies in depth, seriously summarizing the advanced experience created by the masses and strengthening weak links (backward cooperatives or a backward aspect of each cooperative's work) is the most effective method.

Seriously summarizing the experience of the masses, promoting it among the masses, and continuously enriching it in practice to enrich leadership knowledge is the mass line working method instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong: "from the masses, to the masses." Although the existing mutual aid and cooperative backbone members are generally weak in ability and insufficient in number, many backbone members have grown up in various social reform movements in the years since liberation, and they have strong leadership abilities. In addition, new activists are constantly emerging in the socialist transformation of agriculture. These backbone members who have grown up among the peasant masses have relatively rich production knowledge and have close ties with the peasant masses, and are familiar with the lives and habits of the peasants. After they understand the basic knowledge of leading collective production, they will create many good experiences in their actual work. On the other hand, there are differences between the plains, mountains, and hilly areas in various places, and the ideological awareness levels of the peasants vary between villages, and there are also many differences in the specific production conditions between cooperatives; therefore, the specific methods for the cooperative's production plans, labor organization, labor accounting, financial management, political and ideological education, and other work, must not be completely uniform. Generally speaking, the leadership can only determine some principles and provide some basic methods. (These principles and basic methods are also summarized from the actual movement.) How can these principles be combined with the actual conditions of each cooperative to become concrete methods to guide the work of each cooperative? It is not enough to rely solely on the experience created by leading cadres at all levels from key points; it is also necessary to pay great attention to the new experiences created by the masses. By doing so, it is possible to summarize many new experiences from all aspects to enrich and enhance the knowledge of leading cadres at all levels.

In any movement, there are three forms: advanced, intermediate, and backward. It is difficult to imagine that the backward can be transformed into the advanced without special effort. The agricultural cooperative movement is also the same. Especially when cooperatives are developing relatively quickly and in large numbers, a considerable number of cooperatives are established without preparation or with insufficient preparation; and because we also have to do grain unified purchase and sales work and other work at the same time, it is inevitable that leading cadres at all levels will not be able to concentrate all their efforts on rectifying and consolidating the newly established cooperatives for a period of time. Therefore, some cooperatives will experience confusion and backwardness; this phenomenon is even more prominent in cooperatives with weak leading backbone members. These cooperatives cannot overcome difficulties solely by relying on the backbone members of the cooperative. If the leadership does not provide assistance in a timely manner, some cooperatives will inevitably collapse. This will not only cause a half-baked phenomenon in the work, but also affect production and affect the continued progress of the cooperative movement in this region. This is incompatible with the central government's policy of "only allowing good management and not allowing bad management." At the same time, it is also necessary to understand that in the process of assisting backward cooperatives in solving problems, we can specifically understand the reasons for their backwardness and gain experience in overcoming backward phenomena, which can also enrich and improve leadership capabilities.

By grasping the most advanced and the most backward ends, and then using the experiences and lessons of these cooperatives to promote the general cooperatives and solve the problems of the general cooperatives, we can most effectively promote the overall situation and relatively reduce the imbalance in the development of the movement in a region.

    重视新生力量，加强薄弱环节
    ——从宜宾县两个农业社的情况谈到群众路线的领导方法
    王海均
    四川省宜宾县第二区最近召集全区十六个农业生产合作社的主任、生产队长和部分驻社干部开会，检查了春耕准备工作。在会议上，各社汇报了在组织劳动中和生产中的具体问题和经验；有两个合作社的情况引起了大家的注意。
    一个是大土社，全社二十二户。小春青苗长得同互助组的差不多，还有荒地和没有补苗的缺窝，窝距行距都在一尺以上。做活同互助组一样，天天评分；各个生产队评分标准不一，互相猜忌。第二生产队的活做得比较好，经常帮助第一生产队做活。可是两队的工分却差不多。社内财务混乱，农具乱丢没人管理；哪个社员想买什么就用社里的钱买，没有必要的开支制度。三个社干部都是党员，但彼此不团结。社员对社干部有意见，都说：“这样搞法，要减产。”社外群众也暗地讽刺这个社。因为成员大部分是贫农和新中农，社干部也还是想把社办好的，所以这个社没有垮，也还没有社员退社。
    另一个是杨柳塘社。这个社的骨干和社员群众摸索着试行了农活“包工”的办法。按他们“包工”的内容和性质来看，接近于“包工包产”。他们经过社员讨论，采用在肥田播谷种、搞好水利、小春干田三犁三耙、调剂秧田等办法，挖掘生产潜力，订出了大春生产计划。他们还计划在水田里养鱼五百条，在山上种桐子树一千八百多株，对柑子树实行“接枝”（五年后即可收获柑子），另外还种了不少药材。到一月上旬，已积肥二万多挑，平均每挑田可上二十五挑肥料；如集中施用在瘦土上，每挑田可以有四十多挑。目前社员还在继续积极积肥。同时，还组织社内的剩余劳动力打草席。
    这两个社，都没有驻社干部，是由社里的骨干和社员们自己办的。今后，由群众自己办而不是由驻社干部办的社必然越来越多。由于骨干强弱不同，加以工作基础又不尽一致，出现这种好坏悬殊的情况，并不是什么奇怪的事情。问题在于：在这种情况下，领导方面应该怎么办？十分明显，应该认真总结杨柳塘社的经验加以推广，同时也应该帮助大土社改进工作，从中取得把落后的提高到一般的和先进的水平的经验。可是，区委的同志们并没有这样做。过去，他们对区里各个社的情况并不十分了解。知道了大土社和杨柳塘社的情形以后，他们也没有认识到应该怎样进行工作。后来，在县委书记秦俊周和其他几个驻老社的干部倡议下，区委书记才确定派干部到杨柳塘社总结经验。至于大土社，他却推说区里没干部，不想派人去。
    提高区委对于合作化运动的领导水平，是当前合作化运动中的一个重要问题。许多区委的同志们并不是不想把合作社办好，也不是有意拒绝采用好的工作方法；可是，大多数区委是新提拔出来的，他们还缺乏领导群众运动的知识和经验。他们中间有些人只知道应该把着几个老社不放手，却不注意发现和支持群众中的新生的力量；只知道应该把好的社办好，不屑于在办得坏的社去“浪费力量”，不懂得加强薄弱环节对于推动全局有重大作用。宜宾县第二区就是这样一个具体例子。怎样才能提高区委的领导水平呢？除了每个区委委员必须深入重点学习实际知识和学习理论、政策以外，认真总结群众创造的先进经验和加强薄弱环节（落后社或者是各社工作中的某一落后方面），是最有效的一种方法。
    认真总结群众的经验，在群众中推广，在实践中不断充实，以丰富领导知识，这是毛泽东同志指示的“从群众中来到群众中去”的群众路线工作方法。虽然，现有的互助合作骨干，总的来说是能力薄弱的、数量不够的；但是有许多骨干分子是解放几年来在各项社会改革运动中成长起来的，他们有较强的领导能力。另外，在农业的社会主义改造运动中，也不断涌现出新的积极分子。这些农民群众中生长起来的骨干，有比较丰富的生产知识，而且同农民群众有密切的联系，熟悉农民的生活和习惯。他们懂得领导集体生产的基本知识以后，就会在实际工作中创造出许多好的经验来。另一方面，各地有平坝区、山区、丘陵区的分别，村和村之间农民的思想觉悟水平不同，社和社之间的具体生产条件也有许多差别；因此，合作社的生产计划、劳动组织、劳动计算、财务管理、政治思想教育等工作，具体办法绝不能完全一律。一般说来，领导方面只能确定一些原则，提供一些基本的方法。（这些原则和基本方法也是从实际运动当中总结出来的。）如何把这些原则同各社的实际条件结合起来成为指导各社工作的具体办法呢？单靠各级领导干部从重点中创造的经验是很不够的，还必须十分重视群众中创造的新经验。这样做，就可以从各方面总结出许多新经验来充实和丰富各级领导干部的知识。
    在任何一个运动中都有先进的、中间的、落后的三种形态。很难设想，不经过特别的努力，就可以使落后的变为先进的。农业合作化运动也是如此。特别是在合作社发展得比较快比较多的情况下，有相当一部分社是在没有准备或者准备不充分的情况下建立的；又因为同时要做粮食统购统销工作和其他一些工作，各级领导干部难免有一个时期不能集中全力整顿巩固新建的合作社。因此，就会有一部分社发生混乱和落后的现象；领导骨干薄弱的社，这种现象更加突出。这一些社，单靠社里的骨干分子是不能克服困难的。如果领导方面不及时加以协助，就势必有些社要垮台。这不但会造成工作中的夹生现象，并且会影响生产，影响这个地区合作化运动的继续前进。这是和中央指示的“只许办好，不许办坏”的方针不相容的。同时也要了解：在协助落后的社解决问题的过程中，就可以具体了解它们落后的原因，得到克服落后现象的经验，这同样是能够充实和提高领导能力的。
    把最先进的和最落后的这两头抓住了，再运用这些社的经验教训去推动一般的社，解决一般的社的问题，就能最有效地推动全盘，相对地减少一个地区的运动发展不平衡的现象。
