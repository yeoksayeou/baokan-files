Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, London: More than a year and a half after the Korean armistice, the British Ministry of Defence published a booklet on February 27th entitled "The Treatment of British Prisoners of War in Korea." In this booklet, the British Ministry of Defence used many shameless fabrications to insist that British soldiers captured by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army during the war of aggression against Korea were "mistreated."

This slanderous fabrication by the British Ministry of Defence with its specific intentions aroused the indignation of upright British individuals. According to the London "Daily Worker," Jack Gaster, a prominent British lawyer who participated in the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team that visited the prisoner-of-war camps of the Korean-Chinese side in 1952, issued a statement to the press on February 28th. The statement pointed out that the Ministry of Defence's booklet is "a propaganda document published at a critical moment to adversely affect our friendly relations with China."

Gaster said: There is nothing in this booklet that can refute the accuracy of the materials he collected when he visited the prisoner-of-war camps on March 19, 1952. This material was given to the War Office after he returned. However, in the official document published almost three years later, these facts were not mentioned at all. The material collected by Gaster showed that British prisoners of war were treated leniently. For example, when Gaster visited the British prisoner-of-war camps, he was introduced to detailed information about the diet, which was confirmed by the prisoners. These foods included meat, lard, vegetable oil, flour or rice, and vegetables.

Gaster said: "I must say that I am surprised that this document was published so long after the events it describes, and that there are no names or dates available for investigation." He asked the British Ministry of Defence to convene a meeting of former British prisoners of war in Korea and provide open facilities to question witnesses who no longer need to remain anonymous so long after the events.

The "Daily Worker" also published an article by Griffiths, exposing the defamatory nature of this booklet. Griffiths said that he asked the Ministry of Defence to provide evidence to prove the absurdity of this booklet. Griffiths emphasized that the Ministry of Defence "did not cite a single fact to prove this accusation in response to the questions I raised." Griffiths then pointed out that this booklet was published by the Ministry of Defence eighteen months after the prisoners of war were released.

Griffiths said that the Ministry of Defence spokesman has clearly stated that it will not hold a press conference allowing reporters to freely ask questions to these "victims." Griffiths asked the Ministry of Defence why it did not publish the list of "victims," and the spokesman replied: "We just don't want to publish it."

It is reported that London reporters doubt why the British Ministry of Defence must publish a booklet containing some statements that are absolutely not based on facts. It is believed that the purpose of publishing this booklet is to try again to arouse hostility towards the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to provide some "justification" for the United States' aggressive actions in front of the British public who are indignant at the US occupation of Taiwan.

    英国国防部诬蔑朝中方面曾虐待
    英国战俘英国正直人士列举事实驳斥国防部的诽谤
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：在朝鲜停战实现已经过了一年半以后，英国国防部二月二十七日发表了一本名叫“在朝鲜的英国战俘所受的待遇”的小册子。在这本小册子中，英国国防部用许多无耻地凭空捏造出来的事情，硬说在侵朝战争中被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军俘掳的英国军人受到了“虐待”。
    英国国防部这种具有特殊用意的诬蔑性的捏造，激起了英国正直人士的愤慨。据伦敦“工人日报”报道，曾在一九五二年参加国际民主法律工作者协会调查团访问朝中方面的战俘营的英国著名律师杰克·加斯特尔，二月二十八日向报界发表了一篇声明。声明指出，国防部的小册子是“在紧要关头发表以便对我们同中国的友好关系造成不利影响的宣传文件”。
    加斯特尔说：这本小册子里面没有一点能够驳倒他在一九五二年三月十九日访问战俘营时所收集到的材料的准确性。这种材料已在他回来后交给了陆军部。但是，在差不多三年之后的现在发表的官方文件中，竟完全没有提到这些事实。加斯特尔收集到的材料说明英国战俘受到宽大的待遇。例如，加斯特尔他访问英国战俘营时，人家向他介绍了饮食的详细情况，这些介绍是得到俘虏们的证实的。这些食品有肉、猪油、植物油、面粉或大米以及蔬菜。
    加斯特尔说：“我必须要说我对这个文件在所说的事件发生了以后那么久才发表，并且没有可供调查的名字和日期一节感到惊异。”他要求英国国防部召集以前在朝鲜的英国战俘举行一个会议，公开提供便利，来讯问在事件发生了那么久以后已经无需匿名的证人。
    “工人日报”也刊载了格里菲思的一篇文章，揭露这个小册子的诽谤性质。格里菲思说，他要求国防部提出证据来证明这本小册子的荒谬。格里菲思着重指出，国防部“在答复我所提出的问题时，没有举出一个能证明这种指责的事实”。格里菲思接着指出，这本小册子是国防部在战俘被释放之后十八个月才发表的。
    格里菲思说，国防部发言人已明白表示，将不举行使记者们能够自由地向这些“受害者”提出问题的记者招待会。格里菲思问国防部为什么不发表“受害者”的名单，发言人回答说：“我们就是不想发表”。
    有消息说，伦敦的记者们怀疑英国国防部为什么一定要发表一个包含一些绝对没有事实作根据的说法的小册子。人们认为，发表这种小册子的目的是又一次设法引起对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的敌视，以便在对美国侵占台湾感到愤慨的英国公众面前多少为美国的侵略行动作一些“辩解”。
