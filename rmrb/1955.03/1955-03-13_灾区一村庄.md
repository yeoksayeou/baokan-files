A Village in the Disaster Area
　　Zhang Shengyu

　　Last October, I visited Renhe Township in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, a disaster area. The township suffered severe damage, with no harvest of autumn crops. More than 400 of the township's 600 houses were knocked down by wind and waves. At that time, with the strong help of the People's Government, people had already built temporary thatched sheds to live in. The fields were still a vast expanse of white, with floodwaters not yet completely receded.

　　This year after the Spring Festival, I went to Renhe Township again. Renhe Township has already changed its post-disaster appearance. The temporary thatched sheds are gone, and people have rebuilt houses one after another. Tender green crops cover the land, and there are crowds of people weeding and delivering manure in the fields all day long. In the village, every household has pasted Spring Festival couplets on their doors, and at night, children happily carry lanterns and play with flower lanterns. People who come here for the first time would hardly recognize this as a village in a disaster area.

　　Renhe Township is close to the Han River embankment. In 1931, the township's fields and houses were all washed away by the flood. At that time, natural disasters were coupled with man-made disasters. The Kuomintang reactionary government sent "rural clearing corps" from Makou Town every day to go to the villages to arrest and kill people. When the water receded, the farmers dared not return home. A farmer named Wang Bende secretly ran home in the dark. He saw that the green grass on the eaves was a foot tall, and the fields were all barren. That night, he wiped away his tears and fled again. In that year, more than 1,000 mu of fertile land in Renhe Township was deserted. During the famine, the boss of Hengqianhe Grain Store in Makou Town lent 200 shi of moldy wheat in this township. After four months, he exploited the farmers for 400 shi of good wheat, including principal and interest. The big landlord Peng Zhengxing also bought 800 mu of farmers' fields at a low price in that year. Under the heavy exploitation of landlords and usurers, farmers had no choice but to go bankrupt. Poor peasant woman Liu Zhuying borrowed 80 silver dollars from the landlord that year, but she couldn't repay it. The next year, her four mu of land fell into the hands of the landlord. Unable to make a living, she took her four children out to escape the famine, and two of them died of exhaustion after forty days. Later, in order to earn some money to treat her husband's illness, she left her child, who was only a hundred days old, to work as a wet nurse for others. However, in the end, she still had to beg for a living...!

　　These painful past events are deeply engraved in the memories of the farmers. When they were hit by the flood in 1954, some elderly people were still afraid that the famine would be difficult to overcome. However, after this flood, they took a different path and lived a different kind of life.

　　After Renhe Township was hit by the disaster, the state quickly allocated relief funds and loans of more than 370 million yuan in old currency to the farmers in the township. This powerful support enabled the disaster-stricken farmers throughout the township to solve their immediate living difficulties and build houses. In the self-salvation through production, the township established four agricultural production cooperatives and developed fifty-one mutual aid teams in the second half of last year. In carrying out agricultural and sideline production, agricultural production cooperatives have played the superiority of organization everywhere. The income from growing vegetables on 42 mu of beach land in the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative reached more than 30 million yuan in old currency. Each member of the cooperative increased their income by 400,000 to 2 million yuan in old currency. From late autumn to early winter last year, farmers throughout the township harvested 1.8 million jin of vegetables. The supply and marketing cooperative in the township supplied the farmers with production and living materials worth a total of 2.1 billion yuan in old currency after the disaster. Because the credit cooperative solved the farmers' difficulties, another 403 shares have now been added. Farmers have also deposited more than 27 million yuan in old currency into the credit cooperative with the surplus funds from sideline production.

　　In the days of production for disaster relief, the farmers of Renhe Township deeply felt the benefits that the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the "three major cooperations" had brought them. Liu Zhuying, who had once fled famine and begged for food in 1931, now relies on a wooden boat to transport goods for the supply and marketing cooperative, and her monthly salary can support her family of six. This January, the weather was severely cold with wind and snow, and the river froze, making her life difficult, but she immediately received help from the state's relief funds, and the credit cooperative also lent her 150,000 yuan in old currency. Disaster victim Zhou Fengzhen (female) has a disabled arm. She joined the agricultural production cooperative. She and her eldest daughter do some light work in the cooperative. With the addition of government relief, she not only has no worries about her life, but also can send her youngest daughter, Lianlian, to school. She often says to people: "If it weren't for the government's support and the cooperative's help, how could my daughter and I have survived such a big disaster?"

　　I stood on the Han River embankment within the territory of Renhe Township and looked around. The green wheat seedlings and peas in the fields had grown three or four inches high, and the busy crowds were weeding and fertilizing. In the river, groups of steamers and wooden boats were busy transporting grain, seeds, and other production and living materials to support the disaster area. Wang Daojin, an old farmer in his sixties, also saw this moving scene. He told me that he had lived for so long and had experienced several floods. In the past, when a flood occurred, he only saw the rich getting richer and the poor being forced into a dead end. "But this year," he said with emotion, "no one in our township fled the famine and begged for food. Everyone has enough to eat and wear, and now production is in full swing. We must thank the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government for all of this."

    灾区一村庄
    张声玉
    去年十月，我到过湖北省汉川县的灾区人和乡。这乡受灾很重，秋季庄稼颗粒无收。全乡六百多栋房子，被风浪推倒了四百多栋。当时，在人民政府大力帮助下，人们已搭起了草棚临时居住。田野里，还是一片白茫茫的没有退完的积水。
    今年春节后，我又到了人和乡。人和乡已经改变了它的灾后面貌。临时搭起的草棚没有了，人们已经重建起一栋栋的房屋。嫩绿的庄稼盖满了土地，田野里成天都有锄草送粪的人群。村庄里，家家门上贴上了春联，晚上，孩子们兴高采烈地提着灯笼玩花灯。乍到这里的人们，谁也难以看出这是一个灾区的村庄。
    人和乡靠近汉水堤。一九三一年，这个乡的田地、房屋都被洪水一冲而光。那时天灾还夹着人祸，国民党反动政府每天都从马口镇派出“清乡团”下乡抓人、杀人。水退了，农民还不敢回家。有个叫王本德的农民在黑夜里偷偷跑回家去，他看到屋檐口的青草长了尺把高，田地也都荒芜了。就在那天夜里，他抹抹眼泪又逃走了。那一年，人和乡荒了一千多亩良田。就在灾荒的时候，马口镇恒谦和粮店的老板在这个乡放了二百石霉小麦，过了四个月，就连本带利榨取了农民的四百石好小麦。大地主彭正兴也在这一年用低价买进农民的八百亩田。在地主、高利贷者重重盘剥下，农民只有走向破产的道路。贫农柳祝英（女）在那一年借了地主八十块银元，还不起，第二年她的四亩田就落到地主手中。她没法生活，挑着四个小孩出外逃荒，四十天拖死了两个。以后，她为了挣点钱给丈夫治病，丢下出世才一百天的小孩，去替人家当奶妈，然而最后，她还不得不讨饭度日……！
    这些惨痛的往事，在农民的记忆里是非常深刻的。一九五四年刚受水灾的时候，有些老年人还害怕灾荒难度。可是，这一次水灾以后，他们走的是另外一条道路，过的是另外一种生活。
    人和乡受灾以后，国家很快就拨发给这个乡的农民旧币三亿七千多万元的救济款和贷款。这个有力的支持，使全乡受灾的农民解决了眼前的生活困难并修建了房屋。在生产自救中，这个乡在去年下半年成立了四个农业生产合作社，发展了五十一个互助组。在开展农、副业生产中，农业生产合作社处处发挥了组织起来的优越性。第三农业生产合作社在四十二亩的滩田上种植蔬菜的收入，就达到旧币三千多万元。每户社员都增加了旧币四十万元到二百万元的收入。去年秋末冬初，全乡农民收获蔬菜一百八十万斤，乡里的供销合作社在灾后供应农民的生产和生活资料共达旧币二十一亿元。因为信用合作社解决了农民的困难，现在又增加了四百零三股。农民把副业生产的余资存入信用合作社的也有旧币二千七百多万元。
    在生产救灾的日子里，人和乡农民深深感到共产党、人民政府和“三大合作”给予他们的好处。一九三一年曾经逃荒要饭的柳祝英，现在她靠着一条木船替供销合作社装运货物，每月的工资能维持她一家六口人的生活。今年一月风雪严寒，河里结冰，她的生活困难了，但她马上得到国家救济款的帮助，信用合作社又借给她旧币十五万元。灾民周凤贞（女）一只膀子残废了，她参加了农业生产合作社，她自己和大女儿在社里做点轻活，加上政府对她的救济，她不但生活不愁了，还能把小女儿莲莲送到学校去读书。她常对人说：“不是政府的扶持，社里的帮助，我娘儿三口怎么也渡不过这么大的灾荒。”
    我站在人和乡境内的汉水堤上抬眼四望，田里的绿油油的麦苗和豌豆已长了三、四寸高，忙碌的人群，正在锄草施肥。河里，成群结队的汽船和木船正为支援灾区繁忙地运送着粮食、种籽和其他生产和生活资料。六十多岁的老农民王道金也看到了这个动人的情景，他告诉我，他活了这么大年纪，也经历过几次水灾。过去一遇水灾，他只看到有钱人更富，穷人被逼得没路走。“可是这一年，”他感动地说：“我们乡里没有一个人逃荒要饭，大家有吃有穿，现在生产都搞得热火朝天，这都得谢谢共产党、毛主席和人民政府。”
