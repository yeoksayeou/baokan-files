Banks in various regions are actively cashing out farmers' savings.

People's Bank branches in various regions have universally cashed out preferential grain and cotton savings deposits to facilitate farmers' purchase of spring plowing production materials. In February, more than 69.00 million yuan was cashed out nationwide. Sichuan Province, where spring plowing began earlier, had cashed out 10 million yuan by mid-February, Hunan Province had cashed out more than 5 million yuan, and Jiangxi Province had cashed out more than 3.60 million yuan.

In most areas, the People's Bank has been able to cash out quickly, accurately, and conveniently. Some areas have adopted methods such as "fixed time, fixed location, fixed route" mobile cash-out, door-to-door cash-out, and entrusting credit cooperatives to handle cash-out, so that farmers can withdraw their deposits in a timely manner. In areas of Shanxi Province where there are no credit cooperatives, the county branches or business offices of the People's Bank draw a certain amount of manpower to organize cash-out teams, combining it with the issuance of agricultural loans to carry out cash-out. In most counties of Shandong Province, the People's Bank agencies combine with supply and marketing cooperatives to deliver goods to the countryside for cash-out, so that farmers can use their withdrawals to buy production and living materials.

    各地银行积极兑付农民存款
    各地人民银行分支机构已普遍兑付粮棉优待储蓄存款，便利农民购买春耕生产资料。二月份，全国已兑付出六千九百多万元。春耕开始较早的四川省到二月中旬已兑付出一千万元，湖南省兑付出五百多万元，江西省兑付出三百六十多万元。
    大部分地区的人民银行在兑付中，做到了迅速、准确、便利。有些地区采取“定时、定点、定线”流动兑付、登门兑付及委托信用合作社代理兑付等方式，使农民能及时取出存款。山西省在没有信用合作社的地区，由人民银行县支行或营业所根据可能条件抽出一定人力组织兑付小组，结合农业贷款的发放进行兑付。山东省大部分县的人民银行机构结合供销合作社下乡送货进行兑付，使农民取出存款就能买到生产资料和生活资料。（新华社）
