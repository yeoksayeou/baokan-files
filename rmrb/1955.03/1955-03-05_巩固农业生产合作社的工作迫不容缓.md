Consolidating the Work of Agricultural Production Cooperatives is a Matter of Utmost Urgency
Luo Zicheng, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    After preparations in the spring and summer of 1954, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Heilongjiang Province developed extensively in the autumn and winter. The province now has 21,643 agricultural production cooperatives, both old and new, with participating farm households accounting for 34.6 percent of the province's total farm households (the original old cooperatives accounted for 7.03 percent of the total farm households), covering more than 40 percent of the province's cultivated land area, rural labor force, and draught animals. Cooperatives have been established in 87 percent of the villages. 1,872 villages, 93 districts, and 6 counties and cities have basically achieved cooperativization.

    Many newly established cooperatives have serious shortcomings

    Among the large number of newly established agricultural production cooperatives, some are quite crude. Before the establishment of cooperatives, some county and district leaders did not comprehensively analyze the local situation and the development trend of the cooperative movement. They saw more of the good aspects and fewer of the bad aspects, and overestimated the level of awareness of the peasants. Some rural cadres were blindly optimistic, simple in their approach, and pursued the quantity of cooperatives blindly, exceeding local conditions. After the cooperatives were established, some comrades did not sufficiently recognize the importance and difficulty of consolidating the cooperatives, blindly believing that "the cooperative issue is not a big deal, it doesn't matter if we let it go," and relaxed or abandoned the consolidation work. Among the newly established cooperatives in the province, about 40 percent basically meet the conditions for establishment, the work was relatively meticulous, the majority of the members are in good spirits, most of the investment issues have been resolved, and a preliminary production order has been established. About 45 percent basically meet the conditions for establishment, the work was rougher, the production order has not yet been established, some members are emotionally unstable, and a few members have already withdrawn. About 15 percent have poor or do not meet the conditions for establishment, the work was very rough, only an empty shell was built, the price of the means of production has not yet been assessed, the investment issues have not been resolved, production has not yet been uniformly organized, and most members are ideologically confused. Among them, 3 to 5 percent have collapsed and disintegrated, and nearly 10 percent are close to collapse. Among the 194 new cooperatives in Jixian County, 159 belong to the latter two categories. In Hulan, Huachuan, Nenjiang and other counties, the number of new cooperatives that have not yet determined the price of the means of production accounts for about half of the new cooperatives. In Huachuan County, the number of new cooperatives that have collapsed or are close to collapse accounts for 19.4 percent of the total number of new cooperatives. Landlords and rich peasants have mixed into 15 to 20 percent of the new and old cooperatives; and the leadership of about 1 percent of the new cooperatives is controlled and manipulated by rich peasant elements, remnants of feudal forces, and counter-revolutionaries.

    There are also many problems in the old cooperatives

    There are also many problems with the original six thousand old cooperatives. Judging from the results of production, according to the preliminary statistics of the autumn harvest distribution of 2,782 old cooperatives in 28 counties, the income exceeding the local perennial mutual aid teams accounted for 83.4 percent, the income equal to the local perennial teams accounted for 14.3 percent, and the income lower than the local perennial teams accounted for 2.3 percent. In terms of business management, some old cooperatives have improved very slowly and have many problems. The prominent problems are that the potential for increased production in the old cooperatives has not been fully utilized, agricultural technology reform lags behind the requirements for increased production, the role of new-style animal-powered farm implements has not been fully utilized, the quality of manure fertilizer is poor, seed selection is not good, land preparation is not meticulous, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges is still common. The labor organization of many old cooperatives is not strict, labor discipline is lax, there is a lot of work stoppage and absenteeism, the expense procedures are not strict, and there is a lot of loss and waste. Some old cooperatives do not actively implement diversified operations, have little public accumulation, and rarely carry out necessary capital construction, which affects the expansion of production. Some old cooperatives have been unable to meet the requirements of members to increase income and gradually expand socialist accumulation due to the slow increase in production. Poor peasants are dissatisfied with the status quo and actively demand to expand production. Therefore, further expanding production is a fundamental issue for old cooperatives. After the expansion of some old cooperatives, the investment issues of new members have not been resolved. Some old cooperatives "prefer the rich and dislike the poor" when absorbing new members. Some old cooperatives leave little public accumulation even in good harvest years, and are unwilling to repay state loans even when they have the conditions. In Lalin County, the harvest was basically good last year, but the amount of loans repaid by the old cooperatives was less than 10 percent of the total amount of loans that should have been repaid. Many old cooperatives underestimated production, falsely reported disasters, and liberally estimated consumption during the unified grain purchase, unwilling to accept state plans, and some even forged accounts to deceive the government. Some old cooperatives infringe on the interests of poor peasants in the distribution issue. After the disaster, land rent should be reduced but was not, and should have been reduced more but was reduced less, and the proportion of income from the means of production was increased without principle. In the "Xinfeng" cooperative in Shuangcheng County, landlords and rich peasants mixed into the cooperative and made trouble. As a result of the distribution, the income of the household with the most labor was greatly reduced compared to before joining the cooperative, and the income of the household with less labor and more means of production greatly exceeded that before joining the cooperative. In some places, there is also a phenomenon of infringing on the interests of middle peasants. In Mulan County, some districts and villages reduced horse rent by 20 percent regardless of whether the cooperative was affected by the disaster.

    Most of the mutual aid teams are currently in a state of disintegration, the backbone strength of the teams has decreased, the labor force and animal power have been greatly weakened, and the members are emotionally unstable. The production and living problems of many old, weak, disabled, and poor individual peasants outside the cooperatives have not been properly arranged.

    The Party's policies have not been fully implemented

    There are also many problems in implementing the Party's fundamental line in rural areas. The phenomenon of discrimination and exclusion of poor peasants is relatively common. Some cadres mistakenly believe that "the poor peasants' economy is weak and cannot be relied on," and regard the poor peasants as "burdens," and use methods such as average investment and average distribution of public property to restrict the poor peasants from joining the cooperatives, and exclude the poor peasants from participating in the core leadership of the cooperatives. Some cooperatives have formed the idea that "whoever has strong economic power, whoever has the final say." The poor peasants reflected: "The management committee members are the same, but their words have different weight." Some cadres do not sufficiently recognize the important significance of consolidating and uniting the middle peasants, and lack patient education and necessary waiting for the wavering mentality of the middle peasants. In individual places, the phenomenon of rudely forcing middle peasants to join the cooperatives has occurred. Some comrades lack a clear understanding of the increasingly sharp and complex situation of class struggle in rural areas during the process of agricultural socialist transformation, and lack due vigilance against rich peasants, remnants of feudal forces, and counter-revolutionaries. Many villages and settlements have discovered that rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries are spreading rumors, inciting trouble, setting fire to the crops of cooperatives, and injuring the livestock of cooperatives, but they have not been exposed and countered in time. A few comrades mistakenly believe that "old landlords and rich peasants are honest and good to lead when they join the cooperative," and "if new rich peasants stay outside, the cooperative cannot compete with them, it is better to let them join the cooperative than not to let them join." As a result, some cooperatives are mixed with landlords and rich peasants, who take the opportunity to usurp the leadership of the cooperative, undermine the production of the cooperative, create discord within the cooperative, provoke the relationship between the cooperative and the state, spread negative atmosphere, win over backward members, and disintegrate the cooperative organization. In a certain old cooperative in Xinmin Village, Hulan, due to the sabotage of rich peasants, eight hectares of flax were sown with seeds that were intentionally too shallow, and as a result, not a single plant was harvested; six hectares of sorghum were sown with seeds that were too deep, and each hectare only produced more than one stone and six dou. In this village's three new cooperatives, two of the cooperative directors are new rich peasants.

    Consolidating the work of agricultural cooperatives is a matter of utmost urgency

    According to the instructions of the Central Committee, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee has decided to closely integrate the work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives with the preparations for spring plowing before the spring plowing, and shift the focus of rural work to the rectification and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. This is because: Whether the existing socialist positions in rural areas are consolidated or not is the key to whether the agricultural cooperativization movement in the province can develop healthily in the future. If the existing cooperatives are not well managed, even if only one-tenth are not well managed, the absolute number is also very large, and the bad influence in rural areas will be serious. The number of weak cooperatives will increase greatly, the masses' minds will be confused, the leadership will be passive, and the cooperativization movement that is moving forward will go backwards, hindering the smooth completion of the entire cooperativization plan.

    To regard the rectification and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives as an important part of the current rural work is also because agricultural cooperatives have already had a decisive significance in completing the agricultural production increase plan. The province's agricultural production cooperatives include 35 percent of the farm households, including more than 40 percent of the rural labor force, draught animals, and cultivated land area. This situation shows that agricultural production cooperatives are already in a pivotal position in the province's agricultural economic development. If the cooperatives are well managed, more than 40 percent of the province's labor, animal power, and land will be used to their full potential, which can effectively unite and lead the mutual aid teams and individual peasants, improve technology, and increase production. If the agricultural production cooperatives are not well managed, the damage to production will be great. If individual management lacking a plan can still barely be maintained, then the production of the cooperatives must have a plan and reasonable business management. If it is not done well, it is easy to shirk responsibility to each other, and work stoppage and waste will cause adverse consequences to production. If individual management is not well managed, it only involves that one family and a few hectares of land; if the cooperative reduces production, it is dozens of families and hundreds of hectares of land.

    At the same time, we must recognize that peasants participate in cooperatives and take the socialist road, with the requirements of actively producing, supporting national construction, and improving their own lives, which is the driving force for expanding agricultural reproduction; but on the other hand, as small private owners, peasants are currently in a transitional period from individual management to collective production. If it is not done well, they will work passively and reduce production. Not only will the production within the cooperative not be well managed, but it will also have a very bad impact on the masses outside the cooperative. From this point of view, doing a good job in the rectification and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives is also very important.

    From which aspects to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives

    How to rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives?

    The consolidation of agricultural cooperatives should be based on the ideological foundation of unity and progress towards socialism. Therefore, propaganda and education on the four standards for running cooperatives well (increasing production, rational distribution, accepting state plans, and uniting peasants outside the cooperatives) should be carried out universally in each cooperative. Members should be educated to work actively, care about the production of the cooperative, abide by labor discipline, cherish public property, actively reform agricultural technology, rationally organize labor, strengthen planned management, improve the financial system, clearly understand the principle of taking agricultural production as the main task and gradually developing diversified operations according to conditions, and criticize capitalist management ideas; the principle of combining the collective interests of the whole cooperative with the individual interests of the members, and the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit between poor and middle peasants should be explained; unreasonable phenomena such as excluding poor peasants or infringing on the interests of middle peasants in investment issues should be criticized; members should be made aware of the close relationship between industry and agriculture, the unity of the interests of the state and peasants, the necessity of the cooperative taking the lead in accepting state plans, and opposing various ideas and behaviors that are unwilling to accept state plans; members should be educated to promote the socialist spirit of "the advanced leading the backward," unite mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and criticize phenomena such as being arrogant and complacent, discriminating against mutual aid teams, and excluding new members. This ideological education work should be carried out in light of the actual ideological situation of the members of each cooperative, grasping the main points and connecting with reality; and it should be combined with solving various practical problems within the cooperative.

    Effectively doing a good job in preparing for spring plowing is the center of rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. Each county should take agricultural production cooperatives as the center, unify production planning, put forward overall production plans and the main measures to achieve production increase plans, fully utilize the superior conditions brought about by the great development of cooperatives to develop production, and effectively ensure that all cooperatives can increase production. Old cooperatives should formulate annual production plans on the basis of summarizing last year's production experience and management experience, implement diversified operations conditionally, mobilize members to tap the potential for increased production, find the key and tricks for increased production, continuously improve technology, and carry out long-term construction in a planned way. New cooperatives should quickly establish a minimum production order, formulate plans for reforming technology and expanding production, make preparations according to plan; and can also encourage members' enthusiasm for labor and investment by formulating this year's production plan and calculating the possible income.

    Another important task for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives is to reasonably solve some specific issues related to the individual economic interests of members of new and old cooperatives. Old cooperatives should do a good job in distribution and settlement, and correct unreasonable phenomena in distribution in accordance with the principles of harmonious combination of collective and individual interests and mutual assistance and mutual benefit. New cooperatives should focus on solving the investment issue, mobilizing members to solve the production funds and car and horse joining the cooperative issue by means of paying share funds.

    For the consolidation of the cooperative, it is also necessary to rectify the organization, purify the organization of the cooperative, and improve the leadership of the cooperative on the basis of carrying out socialist education, improving the awareness of the members, and in accordance with the specific situation of each cooperative. In accordance with the Central Committee's instructions that rich peasants should generally not be allowed to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations before 1957, the landlords and rich peasant elements who have mixed into the cooperative should be dealt with separately according to their performance after joining the cooperative and the conditions of mass awareness. Those who should be retained should be retained as appropriate, and those who should be cleaned out should be resolutely cleaned out; landlords and rich peasants who remain in the cooperative should generally not be counted as members, and they should be supervised to work and continue to transform. The leading backbone of the cooperative should be kept in the hands of poor peasants and new middle peasants who have socialist awareness and adhere to the Party's policies, and old middle peasants who have fair and capable conditions should also be absorbed to serve as leading positions in the cooperative. A few who have a strong capitalist ideology, do not implement the Party's policies, and are dissatisfied by the members of the cooperative and hold the leading power of the cooperative should be democratically re-elected by the members' meeting.

    Different cooperatives should have different priorities

    When carrying out the rectification and consolidation work, different cooperatives should have different requirements and priorities. The main task of old cooperatives is to solve the problems of further expanding production, increasing labor productivity, and correspondingly improving management level on the basis of summarizing experience, and to appropriately solve the problems left over from expanding the cooperative. New cooperatives with better construction quality and fewer problems should focus on tapping the potential for increased production, formulating this year's production plan, carrying out spring plowing preparation work, and gradually establishing and improving management systems. New cooperatives with more problems should seize the establishment of production order, formulate this year's production plan, and at the same time solve the production investment issue and rectify the organization steadily. For cooperatives that are very rough in construction, the price of the means of production has not been specifically determined, and only a framework has been built, the main task is to solve the investment issue, continue to complete the construction work, and quickly shift to production. For a few cooperatives that are close to collapse, the principle of striving to consolidate as much as possible should be adopted. If one can be consolidated, then one should be consolidated; if it still cannot be consolidated after a lot of work, it should be helped to reorganize into mutual aid teams under leadership. For members who request to withdraw from the cooperative, those who still want to withdraw from the cooperative after patient education should adhere to the principle of voluntariness and allow them to withdraw from the cooperative, and there should be no discrimination or attacks after withdrawal. For those who request to join the cooperative again after withdrawing from the cooperative, a welcome attitude should be adopted. For "sham cooperatives" that are manipulated and controlled by hostile elements, the masses should be mobilized to reorganize or dissolve them.

    While rectifying the cooperatives, the mutual aid teams should also be rectified. Before the spring plowing, the mutual aid teams should be universally finalized, the members should be determined, the backbone should be equipped, the labor force and animal power should be adjusted, a mutually beneficial system should be established, a spring plowing plan should be formulated, and production actions should be started. In villages with a large proportion of cooperativization, if there is insufficient animal power outside the cooperative, the cooperative can be mobilized to help as much as possible. On the basis of rectifying the mutual aid teams, objects for building or expanding cooperatives should be cultivated under leadership, and they should be helped to establish a contact system with the cooperative; the role of the mutual aid and cooperation network should be brought into play, with the cooperative leading the team, and the cooperative and team helping individual peasants to strive to comprehensively complete the agricultural production increase plan.

    巩固农业生产合作社的工作迫不容缓
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部副部长　骆子程
    经过一九五四年春夏的准备，黑龙江省农业合作化运动在秋冬两季广泛地发展了起来。全省现有新老农业生产合作社二万一千六百四十三个，参加合作社的农户占全省总农户的百分之三十四点六，（原老社农户占总农户的百分之七点零三），包括了全省耕地面积、农村劳动力、耕畜的百分之四十以上，百分之八十七的村都有了社，有一千八百七十二个村、九十三个区和六个县、市，已经基本合作化。
    不少新建社有严重的缺点
    在新建的这一大批农业生产合作社当中，有一些是相当粗糙的。在建社以前，有些县、区领导同志对本地情况和建社运动的发展形势分析不全面，从好的方面看的多，从不好的方面看的少，对农民觉悟程度估计过高；有些农村干部盲目乐观，简单从事，超越当地可能条件，盲目追求社的数量。社建成后，有些同志对巩固社的重要性和艰巨性认识不足，盲目认为“社的问题不大，撂一撂不要紧”，放松或放弃了社的巩固工作。在全省新建社当中，建社条件基本具备、建社工作还细致、社员多数情绪好、入股投资问题大部分已解决、已建立初步的生产秩序的，约占百分之四十；大体具备建社条件、建社工作较粗糙、生产秩序还没有建立起来、部分社员情绪不稳、少数社员已经退社的，约占百分之四十五；建社条件较差或不具备建社条件、建社工作很粗糙、只搭了个空架子，生产资料还没有评定代价、入股投资问题还没有解决、生产还没有统一组织、多数社员思想混乱的，约占百分之十五，其中已垮台散伙的占百分之三至五，接近垮台的占百分之十左右。集贤县一百九十四个新社中，有一百五十九个是属于后两类的。呼兰、桦川、嫩江等县尚未确定生产资料代价的社占新社半数左右。桦川县已垮台和接近垮台的新社占新社总数的百分之十九点四。百分之十五到二十的新老社混入了地主和富农；约有百分之一的新社的领导权被富农分子和残余封建势力、反革命分子把持操纵。
    老社中间也有许多问题
    原有的六千多个老社，也有许多问题。从生产结果看，据二十八县二千七百八十二个老社秋收预分统计，收入超过当地常年互助组的占百分之八十三点四，和当地常年组收入相等的占百分之十四点三，低于当地常年组收入的占百分之二点三。在经营管理方面，一部分老社提高得很慢，问题很多。突出的问题是老社增产潜力发挥不够，农业技术改革落后于增产要求，新式畜力农具的作用没有充分发挥，粪肥质量差，籽种选育不善，整地不细，缺苗断垅现象仍然普遍存在。不少老社的劳动组织不严密，劳动纪律松懈，窝工旷工多，开支手续不严，损失浪费大。有些老社不积极实行多种经营，公共积累少，很少进行必要的基本建设，影响了生产的扩大。有些老社由于生产提高缓慢，已不能满足社员增加收入和逐步扩大社会主义积累的要求。贫农不满现状，积极要求扩大生产。因此，进一步扩大生产，已是老社带根本性的问题。一部分老社扩大后，新社员入股投资问题没有解决。有些老社在吸收新社员时“嫌贫爱富”。有些老社年景丰收也少留公积金，有条件也不愿归还国家贷款。拉林县去年基本丰收，但老社偿还贷款数量尚不到应偿还贷款总额的百分之十。很多老社在粮食统购时，低估产量，虚报灾情，宽打消费，不愿接受国家计划，甚至有的假造账目，欺骗政府。部分老社在分配问题上有侵犯贫农利益现象，受灾后地租应减不减，受了重灾应多减却少减，无原则地加大生产资料所得部分。双城县“新丰”社混入社内的地主富农捣鬼，分配的结果，劳力最多的户的收入比入社以前大大减少，劳动力少生产资料多的户的收入大大超过入社以前。有的地方也有侵犯中农利益的现象。木兰县有的区村不问合作社受灾与否马租一律减低百分之二十。
    大部分互助组目前处于涣散状态，组的骨干力量减少，劳力、畜力大大削弱，组员情绪不安定。许多社外的老弱残疾个体贫困农民的生产生活问题，还没得到妥善安排。
    党的政策还没有全面地贯彻
    在执行党在农村的根本路线方面也有不少问题。歧视排挤贫农的现象比较普遍。有些干部错误地认为“贫农经济弱，没法依靠”，把贫农看作是“累赘”“负担”，用平均投资、平均摊公共财产等办法限制贫农入社，排斥贫农参加社的领导核心。有的社形成“谁经济力量强，谁说话算”。贫农反映：“一样的管理委员，说话有硬有软。”也有些干部对巩固团结中农的重要意义认识不够，对中农的动摇心理缺乏耐心的教育和必要的等待，个别地方曾发生粗暴地强迫中农入社的现象。也有部分同志对农业社会主义改造过程中农村阶级斗争尖锐化复杂化的形势缺乏明确的认识，对富农、残余封建势力和反革命分子缺乏应有的警惕。许多村屯发现了富农和反革命分子造谣挑拨、放火烧合作社庄稼、伤害合作社的牲畜，但却没有及时揭露和回击。少数同志错误认为“旧地主、富农老实，入社好领导”，“新富农留在外边，合作社赛不过他们，让他们入社比不让入强”。以致一部分社混入了地主、富农，他们乘机篡夺社的领导权，破坏社的生产，在社内制造不和，挑拨合作社和国家的关系，散布消极空气，拉拢落后社员，瓦解合作社组织。呼兰新民村一个老社，由于富农从中破坏，播种八垧亚麻，故意下籽过浅，结果一棵未收；六垧高粱下籽过深，每垧只产一石六斗多。这个村的三个新社，有两个社主任是新富农。
    巩固农业社的工作迫不容缓
    根据中央的指示，黑龙江省委已经决定在春耕前密切结合春耕准备工作，作好整顿农业生产合作社的工作，农村工作的重心转移到整顿巩固农业生产合作社方面来。这是因为：农村现有的社会主义阵地巩固与否，是今后全省农业合作化运动能否健康发展的关键。如果现有社办不好，哪怕是十分之一办不好，绝对数字也是很大的，在农村中坏的影响也将是严重的。薄弱社将会大量增加，群众思想将会陷于混乱，领导方面将会陷于被动，将会使正在向前发展的合作化运动走回头路，妨碍整个合作化计划的顺利完成。
      要把整顿巩固农业社作为当前农村工作的重要一环，还因为农业社对于完成农业增产计划已经具有决定意义。全省农业生产合作社包括了百分之三十五的农户，包括了农村劳动力、役畜、耕地面积百分之四十以上。这一情况表明，农业生产合作社在全省农业经济发展上已处于举足轻重的地位。如果社办好了，全省将有百分之四十以上的劳力、畜力和土地做到人尽其材，地尽其力，物尽其用，就可能有力地团结和带动互助组、个体农民，改进技术，提高生产。如果农业生产合作社办不好，给生产带来的损害就会很大。如果说个体经营缺乏计划还能勉强维持，那么合作社的生产就必须有计划，有合理的经营管理，搞不好很容易相互推诿，窝工浪费给生产造成不良后果。个体经营搞不好，所涉及的仅仅是那一家，几垧地；合作社要减产，就是几十家，几百垧地。
    同时，我们要认识到：农民参加合作社，走社会主义道路，有积极生产、支援国家建设、改善自己生活的要求，这是扩大农业再生产的动力；但是，另一方面，作为小私有者的农民，目前处于由个体经营转向集体生产的过渡时期，搞不好，就会消极怠工，缩小生产。不但社内的生产搞不好，对社外群众也会发生极不好的影响。从这方面看，做好农业社的整顿巩固工作也是十分重要的。
    从哪些方面巩固农业生产合作社
    怎样整顿和巩固农业生产合作社呢？
    农业社的巩固，是应当建立在团结一致向社会主义前进的思想基础上的。因此，应当在各社普遍进行办好社的四项标准（增加生产，合理分配，接受国家计划，团结社外农民）的宣传教育。要教育社员积极劳动，关心合作社的生产，遵守劳动纪律，爱护公共财物，积极改革农业技术，合理组织劳动，加强计划管理，健全财务制度，明确认识以农业生产为主、根据条件逐步发展多种经营的方针，批判资本主义经营思想；要讲清全社集体利益和社员个人利益结合的原则，贫农和中农之间互助互利的原则；入股投资批判排斥贫农或侵犯中农利益等不合理现象；要使社员认识工业和农业的密切关系，国家和农民利益的一致性，合作社带头接受国家计划的必要性，反对不愿接受国家计划的各种思想和行为；要教育社员发扬“先进带动落后”的社会主义精神，团结互助组和单干农民，批判自高自大、歧视互助组、排斥新社员等现象。这些思想教育工作，应当根据各社社员思想的实际情况，抓住主要点联系实际来进行；并且要同解决社内的各项实际问题结合起来。
    切实做好春耕准备工作，是整顿巩固农业生产合作社的中心。各县应当以农业生产合作社为中心，统一规划生产，提出通盘生产计划和实现增产计划的主要措施，充分利用合作社大发展给发展生产带来的优越条件，切实保证所有的社都能增产。老社要在总结去年生产经验和管理经验的基础上，制订全年生产计划，有条件地实行多种经营，发动社员挖掘增产潜力，找出增产关键和窍门，不断改进技术，有计划地进行长期建设。新社要迅速建立起码的生产秩序，订出改革技术、扩大生产计划，按计划作好准备；并且可以通过制订今年生产计划，计算可能得到的收入，鼓舞社员劳动和投资的积极性。
    巩固农业生产合作社的又一项重要工作是合理解决新老社有关社员个人经济利益的一些具体问题。老社要做好分配结算工作，按照集体利益和个人利益融洽结合和互助互利的原则纠正分配中的不合理现象。新社要着重解决入股投资问题，动员社员按照缴纳股份基金的办法解决社内的生产资金问题和车马入社问题。
    为了社的巩固，还要在进行社会主义教育、提高社员觉悟的基础上，根据各社具体情况，稳妥细致地整顿组织，纯洁社的组织，健全社的领导。根据中央关于一九五七年以前，一般地不应该吸收富农参加互助合作组织的指示，凡已混入社的地主富农分子在根据本人入社后的表现以及群众觉悟条件，分别处理，宜保留的酌情保留，应清洗的坚决清洗；留在社内的地主、富农，一般不算做社员，要监督他们劳动，继续改造。合作社的领导骨干，应保持在有社会主义觉悟，坚持党的政策的贫农和新中农的手中，也应吸收具备公道能干条件的老中农担任社的领导职务。资本主义思想较重，不执行党的政策，又为社员群众所不满意的少数把持社的领导权的分子应由社员大会民主改选。
    不同的社应有不同的重点
      进行整顿巩固工作时，对于不同的社应有不同的要求和重点。老社主要是在总结经验的基础上，解决进一步扩大生产，提高劳动生产率，相应地提高经营管理水平问题，适当解决扩大社中遗留的问题。建社质量较好、问题较少的新社，应当以挖掘生产潜力、制订今年生产计划、开展春耕准备工作、逐步建立和健全管理制度为重点。问题较多的新社应抓紧建立生产秩序、制订今年生产计划，同时解决生产投资问题，稳妥地整顿组织。建社很粗糙，生产资料代价没有具体确定、只搭起架子的社，主要解决入股投资问题，继续完成建社工作，迅速转入生产。对于少数接近垮台的社，应采取尽可能争取巩固的方针，能巩固住一个就巩固一个；做了许多工作之后仍不能巩固的，应有领导地帮助它改组为互助组。对要求退社的社员，经耐心教育仍要退社者，应坚持自愿原则，允许他退社，退社后也不得歧视和打击。对于退社后又要求入社的，应采取欢迎的态度。对于为敌对分子所操纵掌握的“冒牌社”，应发动群众加以改组或解散。
    在整顿合作社的同时，要把互助组也加以整顿。春耕以前，互助组应普遍定型，确定成员，配齐骨干，调整好劳力和畜力，建立互利制度，订出春耕计划，开始生产行动。合作化比重较大的村，社外畜力不足，可动员合作社尽量帮助。在整顿互助组的基础上，应有领导地培养建社或扩社对象，帮助他们同合作社建立联系制度；要发挥互助合作网的作用，以社带组，社、组帮助个体农民，争取全面完成农业增产计划。
