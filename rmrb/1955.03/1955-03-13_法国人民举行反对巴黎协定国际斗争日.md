    Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The French working people held an International Struggle Day on March 10th against the Paris Agreements and the revival of German militarism.

    Many factories in France held short strikes protesting the arming of West Germany. Five thousand miners in Saint-Étienne, workers from factories in the suburbs of Paris, Tarbes, and Suresnes, and dockworkers in Bordeaux and Nice participated in the strikes. Many enterprises also held gatherings of working people, where delegations were elected to deliver resolutions demanding the rejection of the Paris Agreements to the members of the Council of the Republic. In the Loire department alone, dozens of delegations visited the members of the Council of the Republic.

    About fifty representatives from various industrial sectors in West Germany went to France to participate in the International Struggle Day against the Paris Agreements and the revival of German militarism. Workers in many French enterprises asked the West German worker representatives to take messages and letters to West German workers, calling for strengthening the international solidarity of the working people in the struggle for peace based on European collective security.
