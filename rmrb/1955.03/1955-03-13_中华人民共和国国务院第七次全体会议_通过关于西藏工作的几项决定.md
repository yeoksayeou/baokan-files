    Decision of the State Council on the Establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region
    (Passed at the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the State Council on March 9, 1955)

    In accordance with the provisions of the "Agreement Between the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" of May 23, 1951, a military and political committee should be established in Tibet. However, now that our country has promulgated a constitution and the military and political committees of major administrative regions have been abolished, especially since the peaceful liberation of Tibet more than three years ago, significant achievements have been made in all aspects of work, and the situation has changed. Therefore, it is entirely in line with the spirit of the constitution and the current specific situation in Tibet to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region instead of a military and political committee in the Tibet region. To this end, representatives of the Central People's Government, representatives of the Tibetan Local Government, representatives of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, and representatives of the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee recently formed a preparatory group for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in Beijing. After full consultation, a work report on the specific plan for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was submitted. Based on the plan and opinions put forward in the report of the preparatory group for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the State Council hereby makes the following decisions on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region:

    1. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is an organ with political power responsible for preparing for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and is under the leadership of the State Council. Its main task is to prepare for the implementation of regional autonomy in the Tibet region in accordance with the provisions of our country's constitution, the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and the specific conditions in Tibet. To this end, the Preparatory Committee must unite people from all walks of life to further strengthen ethnic unity and internal unity in Tibet, strengthen the training of ethnic cadres, and be responsible for consultation and unified planning and handling of matters related to local construction in Tibet and other matters that should and can be done, in order to gradually strengthen work responsibilities, accumulate work experience, create various conditions, and strive for the formal establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region.

    2. The number of members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is set at fifty-one: fifteen from the Tibetan Local Government, ten from the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, ten from the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee, five cadres sent by the Central Government to work in the Tibet region, and eleven from other aspects (including major temples, major religious sects, social figures, mass organizations, etc.). The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall have one Chairman and two Vice-Chairmen. The Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, shall be the Chairman, the Panchen Erdeni, Chokyi Gyaltsen, shall be the First Vice-Chairman, and Zhang Guohua shall be the Second Vice-Chairman. The list of forty-one members proposed by the Preparatory Group of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall be approved by the State Council first. The list of members from other aspects that have not yet been determined will be submitted to the State Council for appointment.

    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall have one Secretary-General and three Deputy Secretaries-General. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme shall serve as the Secretary-General; the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee, and the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China shall each nominate one Deputy Secretary-General, who will be reported to the State Council for approval and appointment.

    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall establish a Standing Committee, which will be formed upon the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and reported to the State Council for approval.

    3. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall establish the following working bodies: General Office, Financial and Economic Committee, Religious Affairs Committee, Civil Affairs Office, Finance Office, Construction Office, Cultural and Educational Office, Health Office, Public Security Office, Agricultural and Forestry Office, Animal Husbandry Office, Industry and Commerce Office, and Transportation Office.

    The candidates for the directors and deputy directors of the above offices and committees, and the directors and deputy directors of each office, shall be nominated by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in consultation with all parties according to the cadre distribution ratio proposed in the report of the preparatory group, and reported to the State Council for approval and appointment.

    4. In addition to accepting the leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in carrying out various tasks in accordance with Article 1 of this decision, the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, and the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee shall continue to be directly led by the State Council in other state administrative matters. If the local financial expenditures of the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, and the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee are in difficulty, each party may directly request subsidies from the State Council and report to the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region for record. The various enterprises and institutions established by the State Council in Tibet shall continue to be led by the relevant departments of the State Council, but they must maintain close contact with the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, and the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee in their work, in order to jointly promote the work.

    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should maintain close contact with the headquarters of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and should actively assist the headquarters of the Tibet Military Region in consolidating national defense and protecting local security. The headquarters of the Tibet Military Region shall also comply with and implement matters handled by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region with the approval of the State Council.

    Decision of the State Council on Issues Related to Transportation in Tibet
    (Passed at the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the State Council on March 9, 1955)

    The successful completion of the entire Kangding-Tibet Highway and Qinghai-Tibet Highway is one of the major achievements in our country's construction cause. The opening of these two highways is of great significance for strengthening the connection between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland, strengthening the unity between the Tibetan and other ethnic groups, and promoting the development of the economic and cultural undertakings of the Tibetan people. In order to strengthen transportation work in Tibet, the following decisions are hereby made:

    1. Establish the Tibet Transportation Bureau in Lhasa (under the leadership of the Ministry of Communications) to uniformly lead the transportation, maintenance, and management of the Kangding-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and to be responsible for studying and managing local transportation work in Tibet.

    2. Under the Tibet Transportation Bureau, establish the Kangding-Tibet Highway Administration Bureau to be responsible for managing the transportation and maintenance work on the section of the Kangding-Tibet Highway from Jinsha River (including the ferry) west to Lhasa; establish the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration Bureau to be responsible for managing the transportation and maintenance work on the section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from Golmud to Lhasa. The section of the Kangding-Tibet Highway from Ya'an to Jinsha River (excluding the ferry) shall be managed by the People's Committee of Xikang Province, and the section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from Xining to Golmud shall be managed by the People's Committee of Qinghai Province.

    3. In order to ensure the transportation needs of the Kangding-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, purchase 750 vehicles within the two years of 1955-1956, which will be distributed by the Ministry of Communications. Establish a car repair factory in Lhasa, expand the original car repair factory in Qinghai Province in Xining, and equip other necessary road maintenance and transportation equipment along the route.

    4. In order to maximize the transportation efficiency of the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet Highways, the Kangding-Tibet Highway should be strengthened in maintenance and key improvements to maintain normal traffic; the Qinghai-Tibet Highway must be continuously repaired in a planned manner, focusing on improving difficult sections and building necessary bridges. The highway repair work must implement the principle of economy and suitability, and adopt the approach of using local materials, phased construction, and gradual improvement. At present, the section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from Heihe to Lhasa should be repaired first.

    5. The establishment of the organizational structure of the Tibet Transportation Bureau and the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration Bureaus, the preparation and expansion of the Lhasa and Xining car repair factories, the purchase and allocation of road maintenance and transportation equipment, and the continued repair of the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet Highways shall be the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense shall transfer orders to the engineering corps to continue to participate in the repair work of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and draw 750 drivers from the transportation troops in the two years of 1955-1956 to the Ministry of Communications.

    6. In order to meet the transportation needs of the Xigaze area, the Ministry of Communications is instructed to continue to build the road from Yangbajing on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to Xigaze and from Xigaze to Gyangze according to the rough standard in 1955. Among them, the road from Xigaze to Gyangze shall be constructed by the method of providing work as a form of relief, and the cost shall be paid from the Tibet disaster relief fund.

    7. The funds required by the Ministry of Communications to complete the above tasks, in addition to the maintenance and key improvement costs of the Kangding-Tibet Highway, which will be listed in the original investment plan of the Ministry, an additional 42 million yuan will be added to the special investment fund for Tibet construction, which will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Communications in installments according to the plan, namely: 25.19 million yuan in 1955, 14.45 million yuan in 1956, and 2.36 million yuan in 1957.

    Decision of the State Council on Helping the Local Government of Tibet with Construction Matters
    (Passed at the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the State Council on March 9, 1955)

    In order to promote the development of local construction in Tibet, accept the proposals of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and in accordance with the current needs and possible conditions in Tibet, it is decided to allocate funds and send technical personnel to help the local government of Tibet carry out the following economic and cultural construction:

    1. Establish a relatively well-equipped hydroelectric power plant in Lhasa. At the same time, send technical personnel to Xigaze for investigation. After the highway is built to Xigaze, plan the hydroelectric power generation in Xigaze according to the specific conditions. At present, a small thermal power plant should be established in Xigaze first to solve the needs of lighting and communication.

    2. Establish a leather factory in Lhasa, mainly to process raw hides and manufacture some finished products needed locally; and establish a small iron factory, mainly to manufacture agricultural tools and spare parts for simple machinery.

    3. Build river dikes and dams on the Lhasa River and the Nyang Chu River to prevent floods from harming the cities of Lhasa and Xigaze and to solve the problem of irrigation for some farmland.

    4. Based on the current "July 1st" agricultural experiment station in Lhasa, gradually increase equipment and equip necessary agricultural scientific and technical personnel to make it a relatively well-equipped agricultural experiment station. Allocate two water pumps to Xigaze to test small-scale farmland irrigation.

    5. Change the cadre school of the Tibet Military Region into a local cadre school in Tibet and expand it to strengthen the training of Tibetan and other ethnic cadres. Expand the school building of Xigaze Primary School so that it can be expanded from the current capacity of 200 students to a capacity of 500 students.

    6. Build a cobblestone road in Lhasa City and Xigaze City, respectively.

    7. Build office space for the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee and a Lhasa guesthouse.

    8. Allocate 1 million yuan to the local government of Tibet (Tibetan Local Government, Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, Qamdo People's Liberation Committee) for the purchase of agricultural tools. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall make unified plans, negotiate the distribution according to the specific circumstances, and inspect and guide the distribution of agricultural tools in various places.

    The above construction projects are the responsibility of the relevant departments of the State Council. The establishment of a hydroelectric power plant is the responsibility of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. The construction of river dikes and dams is the responsibility of the Ministry of Water Resources. The establishment of leather and iron factories is the responsibility of the Ministry of Local Industry. The three ministries of fuel industry, water resources, and local industry should immediately consult with the Ministry of Geology to form a working team to go to Tibet for investigation and survey, so as to fully grasp the information and design and construct separately. The design and construction of buildings and street repairs are the responsibility of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Ministry of Communications. The expansion of the equipment of the agricultural experiment station and the deployment of agricultural scientific and technical personnel are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. The above ministries should immediately organize forces to go to Tibet and, under the separate leadership of the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Office Committee, successfully complete the above construction tasks.

    【新华社十二日讯】　中华人民共和国国务院全体会议第七次会议在九日下午举行。达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措，班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞和西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格来、阿沛·阿旺晋美，扎萨柳霞·土登塔巴，达赖喇嘛的卓业清波帕拉·土登为登，班禅堪布会议厅委员会主任詹东·计晋美，副主任纳旺金巴，委员丹龙·才仁班觉，副秘书长拉敏·钦仁班觉，昌都地区人民解放委员会副主任平错旺阶，委员威色坚赞，以及中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武，中国人民解放军西藏军区政治委员谭冠三，副政治委员范明等都参加了这次会议。会上，张经武代表作了关于西藏地方工作报告，阿沛·阿旺晋美代表西藏地方政府作了西藏情况报告，詹东·计晋美代表班禅堪布会议厅委员会作了几年来的工作情况报告。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼也在会上相继讲话。会议在听了上述报告和讲话后，通过了“国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定”，“国务院关于有关西藏交通运输问题的决定”，“国务院关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定”，“国务院关于西藏地方工作人员工资待遇问题的决定”。接着会议通过了“国务院对于西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题的谈判达成的协议的批复”，对一九五五年一月十九日由西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会双方代表签字的这个协议表示满意。会议还通过了“国务院对于达赖喇嘛随行官员领导小组关于西藏自治区筹备委员会组成人员的名额和比例及其主要人员、藏钞、藏军问题的报告的批复”。此外，会议并通过了各项任免案。
    国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定
    （一九五五年三月九日国务院全体会议第七次会议通过）
    根据一九五一年五月二十三日“中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的规定，在西藏应当成立军政委员会，但是现在我国已经颁布宪法，各大行政区的军政委员会业已撤销，特别是西藏和平解放三年多以来各方面的工作都有显著成绩，情况已经有了变化，因此，在西藏地区不用成立军政委员会而成立西藏自治区筹备委员会是完全符合宪法精神和西藏当前具体情况的。为此，最近曾由中央人民政府代表和西藏地方政府代表、班禅堪布会议厅委员会代表、昌都地区人民解放委员会代表，在北京组成西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备小组，经过充分协商，提出了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会具体方案的工作报告。根据西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备小组报告中所提出的方案和意见，国务院对于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的问题，现作以下决定：
    一、西藏自治区筹备委员会是负责筹备成立西藏自治区的带政权性质的机关，受国务院领导。其主要任务是依据我国宪法的规定以及关于和平解放西藏办法的协议和西藏的具体情况，筹备在西藏地区实行区域自治。为此，筹备委员会必须团结各方面人士进一步加强民族团结和西藏内部的团结，加强培养民族干部，负责协商和统一筹划办理有关西藏地方建设和其他应办而又可办的事宜，以逐渐加强工作责任，积累工作经验，创造各种条件，为正式成立统一的西藏自治区而努力。
    二、西藏自治区筹备委员会委员名额定为五十一人：西藏地方政府方面十五名，班禅堪布会议厅委员会方面十名，昌都地区人民解放委员会十名，中央派在西藏地区工作的干部五名，其他方面（包括各主要寺庙、各主要教派、社会贤达、群众团体等）十一名。西藏自治区筹备委员会设主任委员一人，副主任委员二人，由达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措任主任委员，班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞任第一副主任委员，张国华任第二副主任委员。西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备小组协议提出的四十一名委员名单，由国务院先予批准，俟其他方面尚未确定的委员名单协议提出后，由国务院一并任命。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会设秘书长一人，副秘书长三人。秘书长由阿沛·阿旺晋美担任；副秘书长由班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会和中国共产党西藏工作委员会各提一名，报国务院批准任命。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会设立常务委员会，于西藏自治区筹备委员会成立时组成，报国务院批准。
    三、西藏自治区筹备委员会设以下办事机构：办公厅、财政经济委员会、宗教事务委员会、民政处、财政处、建设处、文教处、卫生处、公安处、农林处、畜牧处、工商处、交通处。
    以上厅、委的主任、副主任和各处处长、副处长人选，由西藏自治区筹备委员会根据筹备小组报告中提出的干部分配比例同各方面协商提名，报国务院批准任命。
    四、西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会除按照本决定第一条规定接受西藏自治区筹备委员会领导进行各项工作以外，其他有关国家行政事宜，仍受国务院直接领导。西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会三方面的地方财政开支如有困难时，可由各该方面直接向国务院请求给予补助，同时向西藏自治区筹备委员会报告备案。国务院在西藏设立的各种企业机关，仍由国务院各主管部门分别领导，但在工作上须同西藏自治区筹备委员会和西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会取得密切联系，以期协力推进工作。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会应同中国人民解放军西藏军区司令部取得密切联系，并应积极协助西藏军区司令部巩固国防，保护地方治安。经国务院批准的西藏自治区筹备委员会办理的有关事项，西藏军区司令部亦应遵照执行。
    国务院关于有关西藏交通运输问题的决定
    （一九五五年三月九日国务院全体会议第七次会议通过）
    康藏公路和青藏公路胜利的全线通车，是我们祖国建设事业中的重大成就之一。这两条公路的通车，对于密切西藏地方和祖国内地的联系、加强藏族和其他各民族间的团结、促进西藏人民的经济和文化事业的发展，都有重大意义。为了加强西藏交通运输工作，现作如下决定：
    一、在拉萨设立西藏交通局（由交通部领导），统一领导康藏公路和青藏公路的运输、养护和管理工作，并负责研究和管理西藏地方交通工作。
    二、在西藏交通局下设立康藏公路管理局，负责管理康藏公路金沙江（包括渡口）以西至拉萨段的运输和养护工作；设立青藏公路管理局，负责管理青藏公路噶尔穆至拉萨段的运输和养护工作。康藏公路的雅安至金沙江（不包括渡口）段由西康省人民委员会负责管理，青藏公路的西宁至噶尔穆段由青海省人民委员会负责管理。
    三、为保证康藏公路和青藏公路运输需要，在一九五五——一九五六年两年内购置汽车七五○辆，由交通部掌握分配。在拉萨设立汽车修理厂一处，在西宁扩建原青海省汽车修理厂，并在沿线配备其他必要的养路与运输设备。
    四、为发挥康藏、青藏公路的运输效能，康藏公路应加强养护，重点改善，保持正常通车；青藏公路必须有计划地继续进行整修，重点改善行车困难路段，修建必要的桥梁。公路的整修工作，必须贯彻经济适用的原则，采取就地取材、分期分段、逐步改善的方针进行。目前应首先对青藏公路黑河至拉萨段进行整修。
    五、关于西藏交通局和康藏、青藏公路管理局组织机构的设立，拉萨、西宁汽车修理厂的筹建和扩建，养路和运输设备的购置和调配，康藏、青藏公路的继续整修等事宜由交通部负责。另由国防部转令工兵部队继续参加青藏公路整修工作，并从运输部队中在一九五五——一九五六年两年内分别抽调司机七五○名给交通部。
    六、为适应日喀则地区运输需要，责成交通部在一九五五年内按粗通标准继续修筑从青藏公路的羊八井起至日喀则和日喀则至江孜的公路。其中日喀则至江孜的公路，采用以工代赈的方式修筑，费用从西藏救灾款中开支。
    七、交通部在完成上述任务中所需经费，除康藏公路养护和重点改善费用由该部原投资计划中列支外，另追加四千二百万元，列入对西藏建设投资专款中，由财政部按计划分年拨给交通部支付，计：一九五五年二千五百一十九万元，一九五六年一千四百四十五万元，一九五七年二百三十六万元。
    国务院关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定
    （一九五五年三月九日国务院全体会议第七次会议通过）
    为了促进西藏地方建设事业的发展，接受达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的提议，并按照西藏地方目前的需要和可能条件，决定拨款并派遣技术人员，帮助西藏地方进行以下各项经济和文化建设：
    一、在拉萨建立一座设备较为完善的水力发电厂。同时派遣技术人员到日喀则进行考察，待公路修通到日喀则以后，再根据具体条件筹划日喀则的水力发电事宜。目前，应先在日喀则建立一个小型火力发电厂，解决照明和通讯等需要。
    二、在拉萨建立一座皮革厂，主要进行原皮加工和制造一些当地需要的成品；并建立一座小型铁工厂，主要制造农具及简单机械的配件。
    三、修筑拉萨河和年楚河的河堤水坝，防止洪水对拉萨、日喀则两市的危害，并解决一部分农田的水利灌溉问题。
    四、以现在拉萨的“七一”农业试验场为基础，逐渐增加设备和配备必要的农业科学技术人员，使之成为设备较为完善的农业试验场。拨给日喀则抽水机两部，试办小面积的农田灌溉。
    五、将西藏军区干部学校，改为西藏地方干部学校，并予扩建，以加强培养训练藏族及其他民族干部的工作。扩建日喀则小学校舍，使其由现在可容二百名学生扩大至可容五百名学生。
    六、在拉萨市和日喀则市各修一条碎石路面的街道。
    七、修建班禅堪布会议厅委员会办公用房和拉萨招待所。
    八、拨给西藏地方（西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会）农业工具购置费一百万元，由西藏自治区筹备委员会根据具体情况统一筹划，协商分配，并对各地农业工具的发放工作进行检查和指导。
    以上各项建设工程分别由国务院各有关部门负责进行。建立水力发电厂由燃料工业部负责。修筑河堤水坝由水利部负责。建立皮革厂和铁工厂由地方工业部负责。燃料工业、水利和地方工业三部应即商同地质部合组工作队前往西藏进行考查勘测，以便充分掌握资料，分别设计施工。房屋建筑和整修街道的设计施工由建筑工程部和交通部负责。扩充农业试验场的设备和调派农业科学技术人员由农业部负责。以上各部应即组织力量，前往西藏，在西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会分别领导下，很好地完成上述各项建设任务。
