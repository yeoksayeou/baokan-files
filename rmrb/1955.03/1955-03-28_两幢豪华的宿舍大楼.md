    Two Luxurious Dormitory Buildings
    By Our Reporter Zhu Bo
    Two new dormitory buildings for government cadres, built in an ancient architectural style, have been erected on Di'anmen Street in Beijing. These two buildings are not yet fully completed, especially the external decoration, most of which has not been finished, but it is already clear that they have an unnecessarily luxurious appearance.
    Because there are many government personnel in Beijing, accommodation is extremely difficult, and it is necessary to build some dormitories. The main purpose of building dormitories is to provide convenient and comfortable living. However, the builders of these two buildings did not pay attention to these things. On the top of each of these two buildings, three old-style pavilions have been built. The architect decorated them with patterns from many ancient buildings, palaces, temples, and pagodas. From a distance, they look similar to the pavilions on Jingshan Hill, except that they were built in different eras. Between the pavilions are roof gardens and open-air dance floors. Around the top of the building is a parapet wall, one meter wide. The parapet wall is made of reinforced concrete, plastered with a layer of artificial stone, and then covered with green glazed tiles on the eaves of the parapet wall. At the bottom of the building is a Sumeru pedestal, six or seven meters high, made of artificial stone, with a row of neat and beautiful patterns carved on it. On the side near Di'anmen Street, each building has three gates. According to the design requirements, the style of the gate tower is the same as that of a temple gate tower, except that it is more luxurious and magnificent than a temple gate tower. Especially the middle gate. The green door cover, vermilion eaves, brackets, and columns should all use complex vermilion painted decoration, and the ground of the gate tower is paved with a layer of granite. The sides of the balconies are made of dark artificial stone, with white artificial stone railings. Which of these decorations are closely related to improving the living conditions of cadres?
    Since the aim is to be luxurious, it will naturally cause a lot of waste. The total area of the two buildings is 42,110 square meters, and the cost per square meter is about 200 yuan, which is much higher than the cost of ordinary cadre dormitories. The cost of materials and labor for the six pavilions on the roof alone is more than 546,000 yuan. According to the workers, the total cost of these six pavilions and all the labor is almost enough to build a decent office building. The waste in the building's equipment is also very large. The staircases, corridors, and halls are all made of terrazzo, worth more than 260,000 yuan, which is several times higher than ordinary materials. Obviously, this kind of building is completely incompatible with the current living standards of the country and the people, and it is also divorced from the masses.
    Because the design emphasizes the beauty of the building's exterior, it also brings a lot of unnecessary waste of manpower to the construction unit.
    In short, these two buildings are too luxurious! When our country is concentrating its efforts on building industry, why does the construction unit spend too much money on a cadre dormitory?
    Of course, the construction unit is responsible for this waste. But the designer cannot shirk his responsibility either. These two buildings were designed by architect Chen Denga of the Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction. As soon as architect Chen accepted the task of designing these two buildings, he put the facade of the building first. He thought that the location of the building is the most beautiful scenic spot in the capital, with Beihai Park in the west, Jingshan Hill and the Forbidden City in the south, and all of them are magnificent ancient buildings. If the facade of the building is not handled beautifully, it will be very inconsistent with the surrounding scenery. And it must be in a "national style," otherwise, the building would be too uncoordinated compared with those vivid, magnificent, and glorious ancient building complexes. He exchanged opinions with the personnel of the Beijing Urban Construction Committee, and they thought this approach was right.
    He studied the treatment of the facade forms of many ancient buildings, and tried to absorb the essence of ancient architectural art to decorate these two buildings. He considered several schemes, but none of them satisfied him. Later, he referred to the palaces, temples, gate towers, and pagodas of ancient buildings in other regions of China, studied their characteristics and styles, and then designed the current appearance. Throughout the design work, he ignored the unity of the three basic principles of architectural design: "economy," "applicability," and "beauty." He said: "In the past, when doing architectural design, we rarely considered the issue of saving building materials, emphasizing that the higher the cost, the better, and the more special the designed building, the better." He had an idea that there are fewer people living in the building than those who look at the building from the outside, so special attention should be paid to the beauty of the building's facade.
    Are these two buildings beautiful? In fact, it seems not a new building, but a building that has been left over from ancient dynasties and has just been painted.
    Finally, it is also necessary to talk about the engineering quality of these two dormitories. During the construction of these two buildings, many quality accidents occurred, and some major quality accidents were caused by errors in the technical design. For example, the doors of two dormitories in the third section were designed together, with only a thin brick pillar between the doors, supporting five reinforced concrete beams. The situation was very dangerous during construction, and it could have collapsed if emergency measures were not taken. The construction personnel blocked eleven of the original doorways, added six reinforced concrete beams and two pillars on top of the brick pillars, and added reinforced concrete frames on top of those doors that had to be left to disperse the load-bearing force of the brick pillars, thus averting this dangerous situation. In the washrooms of the lower floors, the designer designed the walls with concealed pipes to be 37 centimeters (it should be 49 centimeters), and the thickness in the places with concealed pipes was less than 20 centimeters. This is a very dangerous thing. Later, the construction unit changed the concealed pipes to exposed pipes and filled the places where the concealed pipes were to be left with cement, thus solving the problem. Other rework accidents, such as changing the rooms and punching more door openings, also affected the quality of the building.

### 两幢豪华的宿舍大楼

    两幢豪华的宿舍大楼
    本报记者  朱波
    北京地安门大街新建了两幢充满着古代建筑风格的机关干部的宿舍大楼。这两幢大楼还没有全部竣工，特别是外部装修大部都没有完工，但是已经可以看出它那完全没有必要的豪华的外形。
    由于北京机关人员很多，住宿极为困难，修建一些宿舍是必要的。修建宿舍的目的主要是为了居住方便安适。可是这两幢大楼的建筑者所注意的却不是这些。在这两幢大楼的每幢楼顶上，都修了三个古老样式的亭子。这是建筑师用很多古老建筑的宫殿、寺院和宝塔上面的花样装饰起来的，远远望去和景山上的亭子差不多，只是建筑的年代不同。亭子之间是楼顶花园和露天舞池。在楼顶四周是挑檐一公尺宽的女儿墙。女儿墙是用钢筋混凝土做的，上面粉刷一层斩假石，然后又在女儿墙檐上铺上绿色的琉璃瓦。楼的下边是用斩假石做成的六、七公尺高的须弥座，上面还雕刻着一排整齐美观的花纹。在临近地安门大街的一面，每幢楼都有三座门。根据图样要求，门楼的样式和寺院的门楼一样，所不同的是它比寺院的门楼更豪华更壮观。特别是中间的大门。绿色的门罩、朱红的檐坊、斗拱和柱子都要采用复杂的朱红彩画，门楼的地面上铺着一层花岗石。阳台的侧面用的是深色的斩假石，上面还有白色斩假石做成的栏杆。这些装饰，有那些是对改善干部居住条件有密切关系的呢？
    既然力求豪华，自然就会造成很大浪费。两幢大楼的总面积共四万二千一百一十平方公尺，每平方公尺的造价约二百元，比一般的干部宿舍的造价要高很多。其中只是楼顶上六个亭子的工料造价就达五十四万六千多元。据工人们说，这六个亭子的全部造价和全部人工，差不多可以建筑一幢很像样的办公大楼。楼内装备的浪费也很大。楼梯、走廊和大厅均为美术水磨石，共值二十六万多元，比一般材料高出数倍。显然的，这种建筑，是完全和当前国家和人民的生活水平不相适应的，也是脱离群众的。
    由于设计上强调大楼外形美观，给施工单位也带来很多不必要的人力的浪费。
    总之，这两座楼房是太豪华了！当我们国家正集中力量建设工业的时候，建筑单位为什么把过多的金钱用在一座干部宿舍上呢？
    当然，建筑单位对这种浪费现象是要负责的。但是设计者也不能辞其咎。这两幢楼房是建筑工程部设计院陈登鳌建筑师设计的。陈建筑师一接受设计这两幢楼房的任务，就把大楼的立面形式放在第一位。他想，大楼所在的地方是首都最幽美的风景区，西有北海公园，南有景山和故宫，而且都是金碧辉煌的古代建筑，如果不把大楼的立面形式处理的美一点，这和周围的风景很不相称。而且一定要
  “民族形式”，不然，大楼和那些生动、富丽、辉煌的古代建筑群比起来，情调太不协调。他曾和北京市都市建设委员会的人员交换了意见，他们认为这样处理是对的。
    他研究了很多古代建筑立面形式的处理，尽量想办法吸取古代建筑艺术的精华，来装饰这两幢大楼。考虑了几个方案，都不能使他满意，后来他又参考了我国其它地区古代建筑的宫殿、寺院、门楼和宝塔等资料，研究了它们的特点和风格，才设计出现在的样子。在整个设计工作中，他忽略了建筑设计的“经济”、“适用”、“美观”等三个基本原则的统一性。他说：“过去进行建筑设计时，很少考虑到节省建筑材料的问题，强调造价越高越好，设计出来的建筑物越特别越好。”他有一个想法，在建筑物中住的人没有在建筑物外看的人多，因此就要特别注意建筑物的立面形式的美观。
    这两幢大楼是否美呢？其实，它好像不是一座新的建筑，而是从古老朝代遗留下来的刚刚经过粉刷过的建筑一样。
    最后，还需要谈谈这两幢宿舍的工程质量。这两幢大楼在施工中曾发生了不少的质量事故，有些重大的质量事故是由于技术设计上的错误而造成的。如第三段两个宿舍的门设计在一起，门和门之间只有一根单薄的砖柱，支持着五根钢筋混凝土的大梁。施工时的情况非常危险，如果不采取紧急措施就有垮下来的可能。施工人员把原有的门口堵塞了十一个，在砖柱上面加上钢筋混凝土横梁六根和柱子两根，并在那些不得不留下来的房门上面加上了钢筋混凝土的框架，来分散砖柱承重的力量，这样才挽回了这一危险情况。在下层楼房的盥洗室里，设计师把有暗管的墙壁设计为三十七公分（应该是四十九公分），在有暗管的地方还不到二十公分的厚度。这是非常危险的事情。后来施工单位把暗管改成明管，用水泥把留暗管的地方填实，才解决了问题。其它还有因改变房间多打门洞等翻工事故，也影响了大楼的质量。
