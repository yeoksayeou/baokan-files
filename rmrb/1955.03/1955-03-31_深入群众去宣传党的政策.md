Go Deep Among the Masses to Publicize the Party's Policies
Li Yan

To transform the Party's policies into the practical actions of the masses, we must go deep among the masses to understand their concerns and difficulties, their demands and hopes. Then, based on these specific situations, we must publicize the Party's policies, dispel the masses' concerns, solve their difficulties, and satisfy their demands and hopes.

Tong Hanyao, a member of the Tongyang Township Branch of the CCP in Yancheng County, did exactly this. The Party instructed him: after the completion of the unified purchase and sale of grain, publicize the Party's policy of encouraging increased production and lead the masses in carrying out spring production. Tong Hanyao went deep among the farmers, using heart-to-heart talks to understand their ideological situation in detail. According to the Party's policies, he adopted a patient and meticulous method of persuasion and education to specifically solve the farmers' ideological problems and practical difficulties. As a result, some farmers who were worried about "more production, more purchase" and therefore were passive in production resolved to actively increase production; middle peasants who planned to go out to find odd jobs and were unwilling to apply fertilizer to the cooperative land also began to actively carry manure; and women who originally did not participate in rice borer control work also organized themselves to actively control rice borers.

This is something that every rural Party member and cadre could have done. They have very good conditions for implementing policies. They are familiar with the local situation, close to the lives of the masses, and understand their thinking. As long as they grasp the correct working methods, it is not difficult to implement the Party's policies. However, many rural Party members and cadres hope that the masses will take action with just a single call. Otherwise, they think that the farmers are backward and conservative and that coercive orders should be implemented. In this way, good deeds that benefit the masses are often turned into bad deeds that cause complaints. For example, not long ago, some areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region assigned the task of planting sugar beets. Originally, planting sugar beets to solve the local sugar-making raw material issue was beneficial to national construction and to the lives of the farmers themselves. As long as the political and economic significance of planting sugar beets was explained to the farmers, it was entirely possible to complete the task on the basis of the farmers' conscious willingness. However, some rural cadres in Tumed Right Banner and Salachi County, just to save themselves trouble, disregarded the Party's policies and adopted the wrong method of allocating and apportioning tasks, regardless of whether the farmers were willing or whether the soil was suitable for planting sugar beets, resulting in great dissatisfaction among the masses.

Now that spring plowing has entered a tense stage, it is the urgent task of every rural work cadre and rural Communist Party member to correctly publicize the Party's policy of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" to the masses, specifically dispel the farmers' concerns, and enable them to devote themselves fully to the upsurge of increasing production.

    深入群众去宣传党的政策
    黎言
    要使党的政策变成群众的实际行动，就要深入群众中去，了解群众有什么顾虑和困难，有什么要求和希望，然后根据这些具体情况，去宣传党的政策，解除群众的顾虑，解决群众的困难问题，满足群众的要求和希望。
    中共盐城县童杨乡支部委员童汉尧正是这样。党指示他：要在粮食统购统销工作结束之后，宣传党的鼓励增产的政策，领导群众开展春季生产。童汉尧便深入到农民中去，用和农民谈心的方式，具体地了解农民的思想情况，并且根据党的政策，采用耐心细致的说服教育的方法，具体地解决农民的思想问题和实际困难。结果，有的顾虑“多打多购”因而生产消极的农民决心积极增产；打算出门混活，不愿给社里追肥的中农也开始积极挑粪；原来不参加治螟工作的妇女也组织起来积极地治螟了。
    这本来是每个农村党员和干部都能做到的事情。他们有贯彻政策的很好条件，他们熟悉当地的情况，接近群众的生活，了解群众的思想，只要他们掌握了正确的工作方法，贯彻党的政策是并不困难的。但是，有不少农村党员和干部却希望只用一个号召，群众就行动起来。否则，他们就认为农民落后、保守，就应施行强迫命令。这样就往往把为群众谋利的好事，办成使群众埋怨的坏事。比如，不久之前，内蒙古自治区部分地区布置了种甜菜的任务。本来，种植甜菜，解决当地制糖原料，这是对国家建设有利对农民自己的生活也有利的好事，只要向农民讲清种甜菜的政治的和经济的意义，是完全可以在农民自觉自愿的基础上完成任务的。但是，土默特旗和萨拉齐县的一些农村干部只图自己省事，不顾党的政策，采取了分配摊派的错误办法，既不管农民是否自愿，又不管土质是否适宜种植甜菜，结果引起群众很大不满。
    现在，春耕已经进入紧张阶段，要向群众正确地宣传党的“定产、定购、定销”的政策，具体解除农民的顾虑，使农民全力投入增产热潮，是每一个农村工作干部和农村共产党员的迫切任务。
