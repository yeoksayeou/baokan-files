Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 13th: The Budapest newspapers published the news of the meeting of activists of the Budapest Municipal Party Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party on March 11th.

I. Kovacs, First Secretary of the Budapest Municipal Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, made a report at the meeting on the resolutions of the March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party. Kovacs also spoke about the tasks of the Budapest Municipal Party Committee in implementing the resolutions of the Central Committee plenum.

Matyas Rakosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that the resolutions of the Central Committee plenum developed everything the Party had created in the past ten years, first of all the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party. All these resolutions were not always implemented correctly. We must now eliminate these shortcomings. We must correct the mistakes arising from the underestimation of industrialization, especially the priority development of heavy industry.

Rakosi then said that in our country, the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party holds the leadership and plays a leading role. Only under this condition can the worker-peasant alliance be realized. What people's democracy needs is a worker-peasant alliance led by the working class and aimed at building socialism. The resolutions of the Central Committee plenum also gave the same clear answer to the agricultural question. We still believe that we should support individual peasants with all our strength in order to obtain high yields. However, we want to emphasize that the only road to prosperity for the working peasants is the socialist large-scale economy - agricultural production cooperatives.

Rakosi then pointed out that it is necessary to further develop criticism and self-criticism within the Party and strengthen the principle of collective leadership. It is necessary to strengthen labor discipline, Party discipline and state discipline. Production plans must be completed in an all-round way. This means reducing costs, increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, and so on.

Rakosi said that we hope that the Second Five-Year Plan will further improve the living standards of the working people and strengthen our national defense in accordance with the requirements of the international environment, on the basis of the great achievements made by the First Five-Year Plan in industrialization.

Rakosi emphasized that the resolutions of the Central Committee have been warmly supported unanimously throughout the country, and are a heavy blow to the enemy's despicable plans. Everyone understands that our Party is now more united than ever.

The meeting finally unanimously adopted a resolution expressing full support for the resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

    在劳动人民党布达佩斯市党组织积极分子会议上
    拉科西就劳动人民党中央全会的决议讲话
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十三日讯：布达佩斯各报刊载了三月十一日匈牙利劳动人民党布达佩斯市党组织积极分子会议的消息。
    匈牙利劳动人民党布达佩斯市委会第一书记伊·科瓦奇在会上做了关于匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会三月全体会议的决议的报告。科瓦奇还谈到布达佩斯市的党组织在执行党中央全会决议方面的任务。
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记马加斯·拉科西在会上讲了话。他说，党中央全会的决议发展了十年来党所创建的一切，首先发展了匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会的决议。所有这些决议并不是经常被正确地执行的。我们现在要消灭这些缺点。我们要纠正由于对工业化、首先是对优先发展重工业估计不足而产生的错误。
    拉科西接着说，在我国掌握领导权和起领导作用的是共产主义政党领导下的工人阶级。只有在这一条件下才能实现工农联盟。人民民主所需要的是由工人阶级领导并且以建设社会主义为目的的工农联盟。中央全会的决议对农业问题也作了同样明确的答复。我们仍旧认为，应该用一切力量来支持个体农民以便获得高额的收成。但是，我们要强调，对劳动农民来说，唯一繁荣的道路就是社会主义的大规模的经济——农业生产合作社。
    拉科西接着指出，必须进一步开展党内的批评和自我批评，加强集体领导原则。必须加强劳动纪律、党的纪律和国家的纪律。必须全面地完成生产计划。这就是说，要减低成本、提高劳动生产率、改进产品质量等等。
    拉科西说，我们希望，第二个五年计划将在第一个五年计划在工业化方面获得的巨大成就的基础上，进一步提高劳动人民的生活水平，根据国际环境的要求加强我们的国防。
      拉科西强调说，中央委员会的决议受到了全国一致热烈拥护，它是对敌人的卑鄙计划的一个沉重打击。每个人都懂得，我们党现在比任何时候都更加团结一致。
    会议最后一致通过了一项决议，表示完全拥护劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议的决议。
