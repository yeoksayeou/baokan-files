Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: Workers and staff of factories and mines, government cadres, city residents, suburban farmers, and cultural and educational workers in Beijing have oversubscribed for government bonds, exceeding the planned subscription target by more than 24%. The subscription phase is basically over, and installment payments have begun. Business and industrial circles have also started subscribing.

In factories, mines, enterprises, and government organizations, the number of people subscribing to government bonds accounts for 80% to 90% of the total number of people.

This newspaper reports: People in Xi'an, Guangzhou, Qingdao and other cities are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds.

By mid-February, the amount of government bonds subscribed to by people from all walks of life in Xi'an had exceeded 1 million yuan (new currency, same below). Dozens of units, including textiles, railways, and posts and telecommunications, have overfulfilled their planned subscription targets. Inspired by the enthusiasm to add bricks and tiles to the construction of the motherland, Qin Xiulan, a female worker at the Dahua Textile Factory, returned to the factory from the hospital while ill to subscribe to 150 yuan. Wang Zhongfa's mother, a loading and unloading worker at the Xi'an City Highway Transport Trade Union, also took out silver dollars she had saved 20 years ago to buy government bonds. Du Pengcheng, the author of the novel "Defend Yan'an," subscribed to 20,000 yuan.

In Guangzhou, many enterprises and government organizations completed their subscriptions within half an hour, and many units subscribed to more than 50% of their original plans. Wu Tingwei, chief engineer of the Capital Construction Division of the Guangzhou Railway Administration, and his wife, Ran Yuan, an engineer in the Engineering Department, purchased a total of 1,200 yuan of government bonds last year, and this year they subscribed to another 1,100 yuan. Some workers with low incomes also subscribed to 5 yuan or 8 yuan. They said: This is our way of supporting the socialist construction of the country.

The subscription of government bonds by government organizations and groups in Qingdao has basically ended, and the subscription figure has exceeded the estimated number by 59%. Most units completed all subscriptions within a few tens of minutes or hours.

According to Xinhua News Agency: As of February 28, more than 60 units in Anshan, the steel capital, had overfulfilled the plan to subscribe to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds by about 30%. The total amount of government bonds subscribed to by all employees of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute was equivalent to more than 52,000 yuan in new currency, exceeding the predetermined target by 54%. Wei Wenchao, a worker at a small rolling mill, prepared 1 million yuan in old currency after hearing the news of the issuance of government bonds, and paid the money on the first day of subscription in the factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 4th: As of the end of February, the workers and staff of 128 factories, mines, and enterprises in Chongqing have oversubscribed for government bonds beyond the original plan. Seven industrial systems, including heavy industry, have exceeded the original subscription plan by more than 10%. Workers and employees of private enterprises also subscribed to government bonds to the best of their ability. Many shipping workers sailing outside wrote letters back to notify their families or entrusted others to subscribe on their behalf.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 4th: The subscription of government bonds by workers in Shenyang has entered a climax. As of March 1, employees of 309 units in Shenyang had subscribed to government bonds, of which 213 units exceeded the original subscription plan.

On February 28, after the workers listened to the mobilization report of the "Shenyang Municipal Workers' Mobilization Conference for Subscribing to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds," workers from more than 200 units subscribed to government bonds on the same day. The workers of the Shenyang Screw Factory overfulfilled the predetermined subscription plan by 75.2% on the same day. The workers of the third workshop of the Screw Factory completed their subscriptions in five or six minutes. The 208 employees of the Third Engineering Office of the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Light Industry subscribed to 3,020 yuan in a few tens of minutes.
