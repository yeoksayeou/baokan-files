    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th dispatch: According to Phnom Penh sources, Cambodian Chief of Staff Colonel Sereik Matak announced that a military aid treaty that Cambodia intends to conclude with the United States is being vigorously drafted. He said that the Cambodian government has already "agreed in principle" to accept "military aid" from the United States, which includes substantial credit and the dispatch of a 20-person military mission to Phnom Penh.

    At the same time, according to Agence France-Presse, "well-informed sources" in Phnom Penh said that the Cambodian government intends to have the International Supervisory and Control Commission leave Cambodian territory soon.

    The report pointed out that the aforementioned statements and talks were made shortly after the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to Phnom Penh, which is directly related to the intensified activities of the United States in Cambodia recently. The United States has been actively undermining the Geneva Accords, interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs, and attempting to drag Cambodia into aggressive military blocs, turning Cambodia into a military base controlled by the United States. To this end, the United States is directing its agents to oppose the Cambodian International Supervisory and Control Commission and attempting to launch a new civil war to eliminate opposition forces.

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: TASS, Paris, 5th dispatch: Political figures here are watching the fact that the abdication of Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk occurred 48 hours after his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. It has been previously reported that the issue of U.S. military aid to Cambodia was discussed during the meeting.

    "Combat" said that Norodom Sihanouk's abdication is directly related to Dulles's visit to Cambodia. "Combat" also emphasized that the already abdicated Cambodian king was considered not entirely suitable to "implement the American plan in Indochina."

    美国在加紧破坏日内瓦协议
    正同柬埔寨拟订军事援助条约
    【新华社河内八日电】据金边消息，柬埔寨参谋长西里克·马塔克上校宣布，柬埔寨要同美国缔结的一项军事援助条约正在大力拟订中。他说，柬埔寨政府已经在“原则上同意”接受美国的“军事援助”，这个“援助”包括巨额信贷和派遣一个二十人的军事使团驻在金边。
    同时，据法国新闻社报道，金边的“消息灵通人士”说，柬埔寨政府打算要国际监督和监察委员会不久之后离开柬埔寨的领土。
    消息指出，前述声明和谈话都是在美国国务卿杜勒斯访问金边之后不久发表的，这和美国最近在柬埔寨加紧了的活动有直接的联系。美国一直在积极破坏日内瓦协议，干涉柬埔寨的内政，企图把柬埔寨拉入侵略军事集团，变柬埔寨为美国控制的军事基地。为了这个目的，美国正在指使它的代理人来反对柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会，并企图发动新的内战来消灭反对力量。
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：这里的政界人士在注视这个事实：柬埔寨国王诺罗东姆·西哈努克的宣布退位，是在他和美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈后四十八小时发生的。前已报道，会谈时曾讨论了美国对柬埔寨的军事援助问题。
    “战斗报”说，诺罗东姆·西哈努克的退位和杜勒斯访问柬埔寨是直接有关的。“战斗报”并且着重指出，已经退位的柬埔寨国王被认为不完全适宜“执行美国在印度支那的计划”。
