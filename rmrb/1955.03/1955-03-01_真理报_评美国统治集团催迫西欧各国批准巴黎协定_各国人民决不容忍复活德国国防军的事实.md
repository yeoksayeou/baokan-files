Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th -- TASS reports: "Pravda" published an editorial on February 28th entitled "The Plotters of Military Blocs Cannot Catch the Peace-Loving People of All Countries Off Guard."

The editorial stated that under the urging of Washington, the ruling groups of Western European countries are hastily pushing for the ratification of the Paris Agreements, fearing that the rising tide of popular movements will once again overturn their aggressive plans. In recent days, the Bonn government has been trying to get the Federal Parliament to ratify the Paris Agreements. The debate was conducted in a tense atmosphere. Only under the doubled pressure of the supporters of the Paris Agreements did the majority in the Federal Parliament, representing the alliance of reactionary parties, vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreements. Therefore, these majorities must bear the responsibility for the following fatal consequences that will result from the ratification of the Paris Agreements: making Germany permanently divided; reviving militarism and dragging West Germany into plans to prepare for a new war; and extending the occupation period.

Although the debate in the Federal Parliament is over, the struggle in Parliament surrounding the Paris Agreements is far from over, not to mention the struggle of the masses of people throughout the country. The Paris Agreements still have to be discussed and approved by the Senate, in which Adenauer does not have a stable majority.

The editorial continued, following the Bonn revanchists, the Italian government is also rushing the parliament to pass the Paris Agreements. The masses of people believe that they have the strength and the possibility to make the Italian ruling group respect the people's will for peace.

Currently, in the French Parliament, a tense struggle is also unfolding, centered on the debate that the Senate of the Republic will hold on the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements. Supporters of the Paris Agreements are taking every measure to prevent members of parliament from proposing amendments to the bill on ratifying the Paris Agreements that the National Assembly has already passed, because any amendment would send the bill back to the National Assembly for reconsideration.

The editorial emphasized that Western politicians must not imagine that the people of all countries in the world will tolerate the revival of the German Wehrmacht. The peace-loving people of all countries have clearly stated that once the Paris Agreements are actually ratified, a new situation will be formed in Europe, because after that, the danger of a new war will greatly increase. The Moscow Eight-Nation Conference has pointed out that once the Paris Agreements are ratified, these countries will take all necessary measures to consolidate their international position and ensure peace and security in Europe. The organizers of military blocs cannot catch the peace-loving people of all countries off guard.

### “真理报”评美国统治集团催迫西欧各国批准巴黎协定  各国人民决不容忍复活德国国防军的事实

    “真理报”评美国统治集团催迫西欧各国批准巴黎协定
    各国人民决不容忍复活德国国防军的事实
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二月二十八日发表了一篇社论，题目是“军事集团的策划者不能使各国爱好和平的人民措手不及”。
    社论写道，西欧各国的统治集团在华盛顿的催迫下，正在匆匆忙忙地使巴黎协定获得批准，耽心日益高涨的人民运动的浪潮会再一次推翻他们的侵略计划。这几天来，波恩政府设法使联邦议院批准了巴黎协定。这次辩论是在紧张的气氛中进行的。只是在巴黎协定拥护者的加倍的压力下，联邦议院中代表反动政党联盟的多数才投票赞成批准巴黎协定。因此，这些多数就要对批准巴黎协定所将造成的下列致命后果承担责任。这些后果是使德国永远陷于分裂；复活军国主义和把西德拖入准备新战争的计划；延长占领期限。
    联邦议院的辩论虽然结束了，议会中围绕着巴黎协定所进行的斗争还远没有结束，更不用说全国人民群众的斗争了。巴黎协定还要经过参议院的讨论和批准，而在参议院中，阿登纳并没有稳固的多数。
    社论继续说，随着波恩复仇主义者之后，意大利政府也匆忙地要议会通过巴黎协定。人民群众相信，他们有力量、也有可能使得意大利统治集团尊重人民要求和平的意志。
    目前在法国议会中，以共和国参议院在批准巴黎协定问题上将要举行的辩论为中心，也在展开着紧张的斗争。巴黎协定的拥护者正在采取一切办法，防止议员对国民议会已经通过的关于批准巴黎协定的法案提出修正案，因为任何修正案都会使得这个法案退回国民议会重新讨论。
    社论着重说，西方的政界人士绝不能妄想世界各国人民会容忍复活德国国防军的事实。爱好和平的各国人民曾经明确地说过，一旦巴黎协定竟然被批准，欧洲就将形成一个新的局势，因为在这以后，新战争的危险性就会大大增加。莫斯科八国会议已经指出，巴黎协定一旦得到批准，这些国家将采取一切必要的措施，巩固它们的国际地位和保障和平和欧洲的安全。军事集团的组织者们是不能使爱好和平的各国人民措手不及的。
