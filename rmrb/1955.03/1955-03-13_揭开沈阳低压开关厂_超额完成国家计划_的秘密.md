    Unveiling the Secret of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory's "Overfulfillment of the State Plan"
    By our reporter Liu Qun
    On January 15th, the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory summarized its work for 1954 and quickly submitted this summary to the leading organs. The report stated: "Last year's achievements were very good, and all major state indicators were overfulfilled: the total output value was 107.3% of the plan, the total commodity value was 103.1%, and labor productivity was 104.5%; the profit delivery target was 100% fulfilled, and the cost plan was reduced by 8.27%..." Because the factory overfulfilled the state's five major indicators, it withdrew 659 million yuan (old RMB) from the enterprise reward fund. Following this, they sent people to the Electrical Industry Administration to request approval for a 200 million yuan "year-end task completion bonus," but were only approved for 80 million yuan.
    Shortly before they reported their achievements, telegrams, registered letters, and official letters from all over the country urging the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory to "expeditiously deliver goods on schedule" and "urgently send people to repair your factory's products" arrived in droves. Forty-four factories requested returns and repairs, and ten factories requested compensation for losses suffered due to the factory's failure to deliver goods on time. In order to cope with this situation, the factory sent seventeen workers to various places to repair the low-quality products that had been shipped. These poor-quality products caused losses to the production and construction of many factories. The Jinan First Machine Tool Factory needed 100 sets of electrical control equipment to trial-produce a new type of lathe. Because the Low-Voltage Switch Factory delayed delivery for more than two months, the completed lathes could not be shipped due to the lack of control equipment. The factory's own losses were also quite alarming, including 8.5 billion yuan in losses due to work stoppages, and 25.1 billion yuan in tied-up funds...
    Why can the factory overfulfill the state plan when product quality is so poor and losses are so severe? Let's uncover this secret!
    "Overfulfilling Total Output Value"
    How did they "overfulfill total output value"? They used five methods: First, shipping products with reduced quality. In February of last year, a switch cabinet manufactured for the First Automobile Factory was found by inspectors to have poorly rolled, loose, and deeply cut, leaky pipes, but the factory leadership decided to ship it anyway. After shipment, the First Automobile Factory discovered the problems and requested a return. Another example is the rotor of a drum-type controller, which failed inspection every month, but at the end of each month, the factory director, the design section chief, and the technology section chief would find the inspection personnel and decide to let it be shipped. Second, producing more products with large output value and easy to manufacture, to increase the total output value. At the end of September last year, when the factory director discovered that the total output value plan for the third quarter could not be completed, Deputy Director Zhang Fugui consulted with the production section chief and the planning section chief and decided to produce several products with large output value in the fourth quarter ahead of schedule, and postpone the products with small output value. As a result, the total output value increased, but fifteen other major products failed to meet the plan and could not be delivered on time to forty-four units including Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Third, whenever the factory failed to complete various state indicators, it increased the amount of subcontracting work. This greatly increased the total output value and labor productivity. Throughout the year, the factory signed more than 500 processing contracts with 77 private factories, with processing fees amounting to 4.5 billion yuan. The output value of these processed products was at least 10 billion yuan. They calculated this amount into their own "total output value." Nine-tenths of these outsourced jobs could be done by themselves. Fourth, stealing the fruits of labor of brother factories. Among the outsourced parts, some products were manufactured by state-owned brother factories. Among them, the state-owned Dalian Electrical Equipment Factory and Shenyang Transformer Factory manufactured 121 magnetic field resistors and 1,150 fuses for the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory last year. The output value totaled 502 million yuan. After the finished products were manufactured, they were all labeled with the "Made by Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory" brand, and the output value of these products was also calculated into their own total output value. After reselling this batch of products, they obtained a profit of over 199 million yuan. Fifth, including tens of billions of yuan worth of waste products and unqualified parts in the total output value.
    "Overfulfilling the Task of Reducing Costs"
    "Reducing costs" was the most difficult problem for the entire factory to solve. They had the following four measures: First, the planned value of materials was greater than the actual price, generally about 15% higher than the planned cost. Therefore, when calculating costs, the difference in material prices was counted as "reducing costs." For example, the planned price of four major materials such as electrical steel and non-ferrous metals used in the entire factory last year was 58 billion yuan, and the actual price was 49.3 billion yuan, a difference of 8.7 billion yuan. Second, the planned labor hour quotas and material consumption quotas were set high, while the actual usage was low, generally about 15% higher than the actual. According to several incomplete statistics from the processing and assembly workshops last year, there were 314.36 million yuan of "black materials" for five types of materials alone. These "black materials" were all used, but not calculated into the cost. Third, underreporting losses. The total loss of waste products, work stoppages, tool and die losses, interest paid on loans, and losses from repairing inferior products throughout the year reached 12.1 billion yuan. However, only 3.9 billion yuan of partial losses from waste products and work stoppages were calculated into the cost, and the rest were not calculated into the cost. In this way, of course, "costs were reduced." Fourth, planning to use good materials, but using substandard and coarse materials during use.
    "Overfulfilling Labor Productivity"
    The completion of state plan indicators in the third quarter was not good, especially the labor productivity indicator, which was the worst. However, by the end of the year, they finally found a way to get through it: First, 125 apprentices participated in production, replacing formal workers in operating machine tools. These people were not counted in the "number of people," and not counted in labor productivity, but the labor value created was calculated into the total output value. Second, in the fourth quarter, more than 30 workers were withdrawn from the workshop to leave production and study, and production team leaders, pregnant women, and workers who did not work well were withdrawn from each workshop for "technical training." After these people were withdrawn, many product parts were sent to outside factories for processing. Third, rush work. The Party General Branch Committee passed a resolution calling on everyone to participate in "voluntary labor" and join the "vanguard team." More than 300 workers and office personnel, doctors, nurses, and police officers all participated. A total of 345 employees participated in this voluntary labor, working for five or six days, totaling 8,227 work hours. The value created by this labor force that was not counted in the "number of people" was added to the total output value. Fourth, firing workers. A total of 28 workers were fired from January to October last year. The fired workers felt wronged, and four of them complained to the Municipal Trade Union and the Ministry of Labor. After investigation, it was found that three of the four workers should not have been fired.
    "Overfulfilling the Profit Delivery Plan"
    Factory Director Zhou believed that "if the entire factory's employees worked hard for a year, and the total output value and cost reduction plans were completed, but the profit delivery indicator was not completed, the enterprise reward fund could not be withdrawn." Therefore, on December 23rd last year, the factory director, the Party General Branch Secretary, and the finance section chief discussed and decided to take out a loan from the bank to deliver profits. When applying to the bank, they falsely stated: "Due to changes in our factory's production tasks, excess materials are stored, and the circulating funds have been occupied by the accumulation of materials. Therefore, we are temporarily borrowing 7 billion yuan to prepare for production needs. The materials accumulated in our factory are currently being balanced in Beijing..." After receiving the 7 billion yuan loan, they immediately turned around and delivered the profits. Their enterprise reward fund has already been withdrawn, but this loan has not yet been repaid.
    If the methods listed above still cannot guarantee "overfulfilling the state plan," then they would call out difficulties to the higher authorities. Last year, they repeatedly complained to the Electrical Industry Administration, requesting a reduction in the state plan. As a result, several major indicators were reduced. The approval letter for this reduced plan arrived at the factory on December 20th last year, when everyone was worried about not being able to complete the state plan. After the factory director announced the news of the reduced plan, some leading cadres happily said: "This time we can complete the task."
    Intentional or Unintentional
    The serious problems existing in the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory are mainly due to the capitalist management thinking of the leading cadres headed by Factory Director Zhou Bozhou. They talk about "completing the state task," but in reality, they disregard product quality, only look at the interests of their own factory, disregard the interests of brother factories and mines, and even dare to deceive the state and violate government laws and regulations. This also shows that the work of the Party organization in the Low-Voltage Switch Factory is weak and cannot play the role of the Party in supervising and ensuring production in the enterprise. When studying the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the Party organization did not examine these issues. General Branch Secretary Song Qinglin believed that "we are basically united" and "there is nothing to examine."
    The problems were exposed and it was a bit unbearable.
    Zhou Bozhou believed: "We were not intentional, how can this be considered an act of deceiving the state?"
    "The data is unreliable and the statistics are inaccurate, what can be done?" Deputy Director Ma Fei said: "The Municipal Party Committee knew about these situations a long time ago!"
    These arguments do not help them. People want to ask: Since the data is unreliable, why did the factory director and the Party General Branch approve these unreliable figures to be reported, so as to withdraw the enterprise reward fund? Can approving unqualified products for shipment and taking out bank loans to pay profits be blamed on "not being intentional" and "inaccurate data"? Are these actions not acts of deceiving the state?

    揭开沈阳低压开关厂“超额完成国家计划”的秘密
    本报记者　刘群
    沈阳低压开关厂，在一月十五日，总结了一九五四年的工作，并且很快就把这份总结呈送到领导机关去了。报告里说：“去年成绩是很好的，国家各项主要指标都超额完成了计划：生产总值完成了百分之一百零七点三，商品总值完成了一百零三点一，劳动生产率完成百分之一百零四点五；上缴利润指标完成百分之一百，成本计划降低了百分之八点二七……”工厂因为超额完成国家五大指标而提用了六亿五千九百万元（旧人民币，下同）的企业奖励基金，跟着又派人去电器工业管理局请求批准二亿元“年终完成任务奖励金”，结果只准领八千万元。
    就在他们上报成绩之前不久，全国各地催促沈阳低压开关厂“急速按期交货”，“火速派人返修你厂的产品”的电报、挂号信、公函雪片似地飞来，有四十四个工厂要求退货和返修，有十个工厂要求赔偿由于该厂未按期交货所受的损失。厂里为了应付这种局面，派出十七名工人去各地返修出厂的低劣产品。这些质量低劣的产品给许多工厂生产和建设造成了损失。济南第一机床厂试制新式车床需用一百套电气控制设备，因低压开关厂拖延二个多月还不交货，造好的车床因没控制设备不能出厂。本厂的损失也相当惊人，包括停工等损失共八十五亿元，积压资金二百五十一亿元……。
    为什么产品质量这样低劣，损失这样严重，反而能超额完成国家计划呢？让我们揭开这个秘密吧！
    “超额完成总产值”
    怎样“超额完成总产值”呢？他们采用了五种方法：第一，降低产品质量出厂。去年二月为第一汽车厂制造的一种开关柜，当时检查员提出管子的卷制不良，松脱，切痕太深，漏气，但厂部却决定出厂了，出厂后，第一汽车厂发现了，提出退货。再如一种鼓型控制器的转动体，每月检查都不合格，但每月月末都由厂长、设计科长、工艺科长来找检查人员，决定让它出厂。第二，多生产产值大、容易做的产品，增加总产值。去年九月末厂长发现第三季度总产值计划完不成了、由副厂长张福贵找生产科长和计划科长商量，决定把第四季度的产值大的几种产品提前做，产值小的产品都往后排。结果总产值是增加了，但其他主要产品却有十五种没有完成计划，不能按期交给鞍山钢铁公司、第一汽车制造厂等四十四个单位的订货。第三，每到完不成国家各项指标的时候，就增加对外包工的数量，这样使总产值和劳动生产率大大地增加。全年仅同七十七家私营工厂签定了五百余次加工合同，加工费达四十五亿元，加工的产值最少有一百亿元。他们把这个数目全部计算在自己的“生产总值”里面去。这些外加工活，十分之九全是自己能做的。第四，窃取兄弟厂的劳动果实。在外加工部件当中，有一部分产品是国营兄弟工厂给加工制造的。其中国营大连电工器材厂和沈阳变压器厂，在去年为沈阳低压开关厂制造一百二十一台磁场变阻器和一千一百五十个熔断器。产值计合五亿零二百万元。成品制好后，都订上了“沈阳低压开关厂出品”的名牌，而且把这些产品的产值也都计算到自己的总产值以内，转手之间把这批产品出卖以后，又获得利润一亿九千九百多万元。第五，把价值数十亿元的废品和不合格部件都算在总产值里去了。
    “超额完成降低成本任务”
    “降低成本”这是全厂最难解决的问题，他们有以下四种措施：第一，材料计划价值大于实际价格，一般高于计划成本百分之十五左右，因此在计算成本时，将材料价格的差数算做是“降低成本”。如去年全厂使用的电气钢铁，有色金属等四种主要材料计划价格是五百八十亿元，实际价格是四百九十三亿元，相差八十七亿元。第二，工时定额和材料消耗定额计划订得高，实际用得低，一般高于实际百分之十五左右。根据去年加工装配两个车间的几个不完全统计，仅五种“黑料”就有三亿一千四百三十六万元。这些“黑料”都用了，但不计算到成本里去。第三，少算损失。全年仅废品、停工等项损失、工模具损失、贷款所付出的利息和返修低劣产品损失共达一百二十一亿元。但是除了废品和停工两笔部分损失三十九亿元算在成本之内以外，其余的都不算在成本里。这样，当然“成本降低”了。第四，计划用好料，而使用时用次料、粗料。
    “超额完成劳动生产率”
    第三季度完成国家计划指标情况不好，其中尤以劳动生产率指标完成得最差，但是到年底，他们总算想办法渡过去了：第一，一百二十五名徒工参加生产，顶正式工人掌握车床参加劳动，这些人并没有算在“人数”以内，不算劳动生产率，但创造的劳动价值都计算到生产总值中去了。第二，在第四季度内从车间里抽出三十多工人脱离生产学习，把各车间不经常参加生产的、生产小组长、孕妇和干活不好的工人都抽去“技术训练”，抽下这些人以后，把许多产品部件送到厂外加工。第三，突击。党总支委员会通过决议号召大家“义务劳动”，参加
  “先锋队”，全厂三百多工人和科室人员、医生、护士、警士都一齐下手。这次参加义务劳动的职工人员有三百四十五人，劳动了五、六天，合计干了八千二百二十七个工时，这些不算“人数”的劳动力所创造的价值，都加在生产总值里去了。第四，开除工人。去年一月至十月共开除了二十八名工人。被开除的工人感到委屈，有四名告到市工会和劳动部，经过调查这四名工人有三名是不应开除的。
    “超额完成利润上缴计划”
    周厂长认为“全厂职工忙了一年，生产总值和降低成本计划都完成了，只差上缴利润指标未完成，就不能提用企业奖励基金”。于是，去年十二月二十三日，厂长、党总支书记、财务科长商量，决定去银行贷款来上缴利润。向银行申请时，假说：“兹因我厂生产任务变更，材料超储，能周转的资金，均被材料积压所占，因此暂借七十亿元整，以备生产所需，我厂现在积压的材料正在北京平衡……”七十亿贷款到手之后，转手就上缴了利润。他们的企业奖励基金已提用了，可是这笔贷款现在还没有还。
    如果以上列举的那些方法，还不能保证“超额完成国家计划”，那他们就向上级叫困难。去年他们向电器工业管理局三番五次地叫，要求削减国家计划，结果几项主要指标都削减了。这个经过削减的计划的批准书在去年十二月二十日到了工厂，当时大家正为完不成国家计划发愁呢。当厂长宣布这个削减计划的消息之后，有的领导干部高兴地说：“这回可以完成任务了”。
    是有意还是无意
    沈阳低压开关厂存在这些严重的问题，主要是由于以厂长周伯洲为首的领导干部存在着资本主义的经营思想，他们嘴里讲“完成国家任务”，实际上不顾产品质量，只看本厂利益，不顾兄弟厂矿的利益，甚至敢于欺骗国家，违反政府法令。这也说明低压开关厂党组织的工作是薄弱的，不能起到党在企业中监督保证生产的作用。在学习四中全会决议时，党组织并没有检查这些问题。总支书记宋清林认为：“我们基本上是团结的”“没有什么问题可检查”。
    问题揭发了真有些吃不消。
    周伯洲认为：“我们并非有意，这怎能算欺骗国家的行为呢？”
      “资料不可靠，统计不准确，这有什么办法呢？”副厂长马飞说：“这些情况市委也早知道呀！”
      这些论调都帮不了他们的忙。人们要问：既然资料不可靠，厂长和党总支为什么还要批准这些不可靠的数字上报，以至于提用企业奖励基金呢？难道批准不合格品出厂、去银行贷款交利润能归罪于
  “并非有意”和“资料不准确”吗？难道这些行为不是欺骗国家的行为吗？
