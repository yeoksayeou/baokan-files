Cotton Region Agricultural Cooperatives Formulate Plans to Expand Cotton Planting

Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in major cotton-producing areas across the country are formulating their production plans for this year and actively preparing to expand the cotton planting area. According to statistics from Taigu, Yongji, and Wenshui counties in Shanxi Province, the cotton planting plans of agricultural production cooperatives this year are generally expanded by 19% to 78% compared to 1954; twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives in four counties, including Chang'an, Shaanxi, plan to expand by 14% compared to last year. In seven agricultural cooperatives in semi-cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province, the cotton planting area this year has been expanded by 25% to 55% compared to last year.

When formulating plans to expand cotton fields, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have gone through discussions with their members to ensure that the cooperative's production plan is subordinate to the state's plan. The "Victory" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaobeiwang Village, Yongnian County, Hebei Province, proposed that this year it could use more than 70% of its cultivated land for cotton planting based on the needs of the state and the cooperative's land, labor, and other conditions. However, some members were afraid of not having enough grain and fodder in the future and found it troublesome to sell cotton and buy grain, so they did not agree to plant more cotton. The cooperative's management committee explained to the members the government's methods for supplying grain to cotton farmers and the grain-to-cotton price ratio to dispel their concerns. They also conducted patriotic education for the members, explaining the rationale of producing more cotton to support national industrial construction. After repeated discussions, their thinking was unified, and the members unanimously approved the plan to expand cotton fields and actively carried out fertilizer accumulation and harrowing to strive for early sowing. The "Guangming" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinzhuang Township, Gaoling County, Shaanxi Province, has a total of 670 mu of cultivated land. The original plan was to reserve 201 mu for cotton fields. In order to respond to the government's call to appropriately expand cotton fields, all members decided to reduce the reserved 26 mu of melon fields to 2 mu and plant more sweet potatoes after wheat harvest, and to use 5 mu of the reserved 6 mu of spring sweet potato fields for cotton planting, thus increasing the cotton field area by another 29 mu. Last year, cotton crops in Liaoning Province suffered from natural disasters and reaped a poor harvest, but this year the cotton planting enthusiasm of many agricultural production cooperative members is still very stable.

While expanding the cotton planting area, many cooperatives are also actively seeking key factors for increasing production and striving to improve the yield per unit area. After the Wang Jinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Second District of Linqing County, Shandong, determined its plan to expand cotton fields, the female members immediately took the seeds needed for the cooperative's 160 mu of cotton fields for seed selection and drove the nearby farmers to also select cotton seeds. Under the impetus of agricultural production cooperatives, some mutual aid teams and individual farmers in cotton-producing areas have also eliminated their concerns and are actively expanding the cotton planting area.

### 棉区农业合作社制定扩大植棉计划

    棉区农业合作社制定扩大植棉计划
    目前全国各主要产棉地区的农业生产合作社正在制定今年的生产计划，积极准备扩大棉花播种面积。据山西省太谷、永济、文水等县统计，今年农业生产合作社的植棉计划一般都比一九五四年扩大百分之十九至七十八；陕西长安等四县二十六个农业生产合作社计划比去年扩大百分之十四。山东省半产棉区七个社今年植棉面积比去年扩大了百分之二十五至五十五。
    各地农业生产合作社在制定扩大棉田计划时，都经过社员讨论，使社的生产计划服从国家的计划。河北省永年县小北汪村“胜利”农业生产合作社社务委员会根据国家的需要和社里土地劳力等条件，提出今年可拿出百分之七十以上的耕地种棉花，但是有些社员害怕以后没粮食吃，没饲草，又嫌卖棉买粮麻烦，不同意多种棉花。社务委员会就向社员说明政府对棉农供应粮食的办法和粮棉比价，打消社员顾虑；又向社员进行了爱国主义教育，说明多产棉花支援国家工业建设的道理。经过反复讨论后，思想统一了，社员一致通过了扩大棉田的计划，并积极进行积肥、耙地，争取早日播种。陕西省高陵县新庄乡“光明”农业生产合作社共有耕地六百七十亩，原计划留棉田二百零一亩，为了响应政府适当扩大棉田的号召，全体社员又决定：把预留的二十六亩瓜田缩减为二亩，多种麦茬红苕，把留的六亩春红苕田拿出五亩来种棉花，这样就又增加了二十九亩棉田。辽宁省去年棉花遭灾歉收，但今年许多农业生产合作社社员的植棉情绪还是很稳定的。
    在扩大植棉面积的同时，许多社还积极找增产关键，争取提高单位面积产量。山东临清县二区王金华农业生产合作社确定扩大棉田计划后，女社员们立即把全社一百六十亩棉田所需的种籽拿来粒选，并带动附近的农民也粒选棉种。在农业生产合作社带动下，棉区有些互助组和单干农民也消除了顾虑，积极扩大种棉面积。（金洛清）
