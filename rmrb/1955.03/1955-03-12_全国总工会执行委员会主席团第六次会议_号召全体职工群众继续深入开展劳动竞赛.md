Xinhua News Agency, March 10th:

The Sixth Meeting of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was held from March 7th to 9th.

The meeting heard and approved the report of Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on the summary of trade union work in 1954 and the tasks for this year. The Presidium believes that since the instruction to further promote labor emulation was issued to workers nationwide in 1954, and the suggestions of Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, and others to carry out technical innovation movements nationwide were accepted, attention has been paid in the labor emulation to implementing the policy of improving technology, enhancing technology, and learning and mastering new technologies to increase labor productivity. More people participated in the competition, and the scope became wider. Many engineering and technical personnel and staff members participated in the competition. Last year, more than 200,000 workers in Shenyang and Hebei Province participated in the labor emulation, an increase of 22% to 30% compared to the previous year. In the construction industry in Beijing, more than 80% of the workers have formulated guarantee conditions for the competition. This extensive labor emulation has played a certain role in ensuring the completion of the national plan. However, since the slogan of technical innovation was put forward, some deviations have also occurred, mainly focusing on invention and creation while neglecting the learning of Soviet experience and existing experience in our country. However, invention and creation can only be done by a few, while the majority cannot invent and create, while labor emulation is a matter for the majority. The emergence of these biases is mainly due to the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the slogan "technical innovation." It cannot encompass the nine suggestions of Comrade Zhang Mingshan and others. In the future, the slogan of technical innovation should be abolished, while retaining the nine suggestions of Comrade Zhang Mingshan and others; adhere to the policy of improving technology, enhancing technology, and learning and mastering new technologies in the labor emulation. At the same time, the development of last year's labor emulation was very uneven, and there were some shortcomings in the promotion of advanced experience, wage work, and organizational leadership.

The Presidium believes that last year the trade union also made certain achievements in helping the state transform capitalist industry and commerce. There has also been much progress in the ideological and organizational construction of trade unions. However, there are also shortcomings that urgently need improvement. For example, not enough attention is paid to the lives of the workers.

The Presidium believes that this year is a year of decisive significance for our country's first Five-Year Plan. In order to ensure the progress and speed of our country's first Five-Year Plan and vigorously support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, the trade union should vigorously mobilize all workers to continue to deepen the labor emulation drive, use their creative labor to increase production, practice strict economy, and ensure the completion and over-completion of the 1955 national plan. To this end, it is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of the labor emulation and improve the leadership level of the competition; cultivate a large number of activists and further strengthen the construction of various aspects of the trade union; promote a democratic style, carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, rectify the work style of the trade union, enthusiastically care for the lives of the masses, and closely connect with the masses.

The meeting also heard and reviewed the report on the international work of the trade union in 1954 made by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the report on financial work made by Li Zaiwen, member of the Presidium, and the report of the Chinese Trade Union Delegation to the Soviet Union.

    全国总工会执行委员会主席团第六次会议
    号召全体职工群众继续深入开展劳动竞赛
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团在三月七日到九日举行了第六次会议。
    会议听取并通过了中华全国总工会主席赖若愚关于一九五四年的工会工作总结和今年工作任务的报告。主席团认为由于一九五四年对全国工人发出了进一步开展劳动竞赛的指示，接受了张明山、王崇伦等在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的建议，使得劳动竞赛中注意贯彻了改进技术、提高技术、学习与掌握新技术来提高劳动生产率的方针。参加竞赛的人员也更多更广泛了。许多工程技术人员和职员都参加了竞赛。沈阳市和河北省去年都有二十多万职工参加了劳动竞赛，比前年增加了百分之二十二到三十。北京市建筑业中，百分之八十多的工人都制定了竞赛的保证条件。这种广泛的劳动竞赛，对保证完成国家计划，都起了一定的作用。但是自从技术革新的口号提出以后，也发生了一些偏差，主要是注意了创造发明而忽视了学习苏联经验和我国已有的经验。可是创造发明只是少数人能作，多数人不能创造发明，劳动竞赛却是多数人的事。这些偏向的产生，主要是由于“技术革新”这一口号不确切、不完善。它不能够概括张明山等同志的九条建议。今后应当取消技术革新的口号，而仍然保存张明山等同志的九条建议；坚持在劳动竞赛中提高技术、改进技术、学习与掌握新技术的方针。同时，去年的劳动竞赛发展很不平衡，在推广先进经验、工资工作、组织领导等方面也有些缺点。
    主席团认为去年工会在帮助国家改造资本主义工商业方面也取得了一定成绩。工会的思想建设和组织建设也有许多进步。但也同样存在着急需改进的缺点。例如对职工群众的生活关心不够等。
    主席团认为今年是我国第一个五年建设计划具有决定意义的一年，为了保证我国第一个五年计划的进度和速度，大力支援解放台湾的斗争，工会应大力动员全体职工群众继续深入地开展劳动竞赛，用自己创造性的劳动，来增加生产，厉行节约，保证完成和超额完成一九五五年的国家计划。为此必须进一步加强对于劳动竞赛的领导，提高竞赛的领导水平；培养大批积极分子，进一步加强工会各方面的建设工作；发扬民主作风，开展群众性的批评与自我批评，端正工会的工作作风，热情地关心群众的生活，密切与群众的联系。
    会议还听取和审查了中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一所作的一九五四年工会的国际工作报告，主席团委员栗再温所作的财务工作报告，以及中国工会访苏代表团的报告。
