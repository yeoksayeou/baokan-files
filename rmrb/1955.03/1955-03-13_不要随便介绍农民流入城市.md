Don't Casually Introduce Farmers into Cities

To the Editor:

I am a cadre from the Labor Section of the Beijing Western Mining Area Government. Since last winter, my colleagues and I have often had to put aside our ongoing work and focus our energy on mobilizing and repatriating farmers who blindly flock to Mentougou. From November to the end of December alone, we mobilized and repatriated 1,259 farmers from 65 counties in 10 provinces. Mobilizing and repatriating so many farmers not only cost us a lot of energy and time but also caused great losses to the country. However, as soon as the Spring Festival was over, just as we were preparing to concentrate our energy on more important matters, many more farmers ran to Mentougou, some even having been repatriated before. For example, Li Guo, a farmer from Jiuyangmaotun Township in Wanquan County, Hebei, was repatriated by us on November 30th last year, and on January 28th this year, he came again with a letter of introduction from his township government.

Why do these farmers leave their homes and run to other places again and again? According to my understanding, it is mostly because some areas suffered from floods last year, and the local cadres did not properly lead the farmers to find ways to produce and help themselves. For example, farmers who came from Nancangzhi Village in Renqiu County, Hebei, Beiwopu Village in Longhua County, Rehe, and Zhangxihe Township in Tianzhen County, Shanxi, when we repeatedly mobilized and persuaded them to return, all said in unison: After returning, the village and township governments will not help them find ways to produce. I think it is wrong for the governments of these places not to find ways for farmers to produce based on local characteristics and casually introduce farmers to find work elsewhere, and the relevant county and district governments should pay attention to correcting this.

### 不要随便介绍农民流入城市

    不要随便介绍农民流入城市编辑同志：
    我是北京市京西矿区政府劳动科的干部，从去年入冬以来，我和其他同志经常不得不放下正在进行的工作，把精力用在动员、遣送盲目流到门头沟来的农民身上去。仅仅去年十一月到十二月底，我们就动员、遣送走了来自十个省六十五个县的农民一千二百五十九名。要把这样多的农民动员、遣送回去，不但花费了我们很多精力、时间，而且给国家也造成了很大的损失。但是，春节一过，当我们正准备集中精力放到更重要的事情上时，又有不少农民跑到门头沟来，有的甚至是已经遣送回籍过的。如河北万全县旧羊毛屯乡的农民李国，我们在去年十一月三十日把他遣送走的，到今年一月二十八日他又拿着乡政府开给他的证明信来了。
    为什么这些农民竟一次再次地离开家跑到外边来呢？据我了解，大多是因为有些地区去年遭受水灾后，当地干部没有很好地领导农民找寻生产门路进行生产自救。如河北任邱县南畅支村、热河隆化县北窝铺村、山西天镇县张西河乡外出的农民，当我们一再动员说服他们回去时，都异口同声地说：回去后，村、乡政府是不给找生产门路的。我以为这些地方的政府不根据当地的特点给农民找生产门路，随便把农民介绍出来找工做是不对的，有关的县、区政府应该注意纠正。
