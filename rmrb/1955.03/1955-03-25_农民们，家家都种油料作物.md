    Farmers, Every Household Should Plant Oil Crops

    In the past year or so, the supply of edible oil in our country has gradually failed to fully meet the growing needs of the vast urban and rural population. The people are urgently demanding effective measures to change this situation. And the effective way to change this situation is to increase the production of oil crops. Now is the season for preparing and planting oil crops. All localities should mobilize the broad masses of farmers in a planned and organized manner, according to local soil, climate and other conditions, and strive to increase the planting of oil crops, so that in 1955 there can be more edible oil to supply the needs of the people throughout the country.

    The effective way to solve the problem of insufficient edible oil supply in our country is to mobilize every farmer to plant oil crops. At present, rural areas account for two-thirds of the domestic edible oil consumption, and cities account for one-third. That is to say, most of the edible oil is consumed by farmers. But now only a small number of farmers in a few provinces produce oil crops. The oil crops produced by these farmers, in addition to self-sufficiency, must also supply the needs of people in cities and industrial areas and export needs, and also supply the needs of the majority of farmers in rural areas who do not grow oil crops; it is unreasonable and impossible to rely solely on this part of the farmers to solve the problem of insufficient oil supply in the country. Therefore, the fundamental way to develop oil crop production and solve the edible oil problem is to mobilize farmers who used to grow a lot of oil crops to strive to increase production and sell more oil to the state; mobilize farmers who did not grow oil crops in the past to plant oil crops according to the standard of no more than one tenth of a mu per person, first strive for self-sufficiency, and then sell as much surplus oil as possible to the state. In this way, the state can control a large amount of oil, which can fully supply the needs of cities, industrial areas and exports; some farmers can achieve self-sufficiency in oil, and most farmers can sell oil to the state. This not only solves the difficulty of insufficient edible oil for farmers, but also reduces farmers' expenses for buying oil and increases their income from selling oil.

    The realization of the above requirements is entirely possible. At present, farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations in our country account for the majority of farmers. Organized farmers, especially members of agricultural production cooperatives, are more likely to accept state plans and carry out production according to state requirements. As long as they are well-led, it is not difficult to plant one tenth of a mu of oil crops per person. Therefore, increasing the production of oil crops must rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to lead individual farmers, which is the guarantee for completing the plan.

    In concentrated oil crop producing areas and general producing areas, the potential for increasing oil crop production is great. The yield per unit area of ​​oil crops in our country is generally still very low. This is because many farmers have always regarded oil crops as "by-products" in the past, and neither paid attention to seed selection, nor to fertilization, and even less to improving cultivation techniques. Many experiences have proved that as long as this situation is changed, the yield of oil crops can be significantly increased. Many counties in Suining Special District, Sichuan Province, selected the excellent variety of "Victory Rapeseed," and the yield was one-half to three times higher than that of ordinary rapeseed. In 1954, the method of seed dressing with rhizobium was promoted in the main peanut producing areas across the country, and the yield generally increased by 10% to 15%. Yu Shufang, a farmer in Hudong County, Anhui, rationally fertilized and carefully cultivated his rapeseed fields, and the rapeseed he planted exceeded the local yield by more than double. As long as all localities conscientiously summarize and promote the high-yield experience of local farmers and promote it, the yield per unit area can be greatly increased. The climate in our country is mild, and various oil crops can be planted from south to north. As long as the land is used rationally (such as making full use of field edges, field ridges, roadsides, ditch edges, house garden gaps, etc.), the planting area of ​​oil crops can be appropriately expanded without reducing the planting area of ​​grain and cotton. In addition, there are still many sandy wastelands in northern China that can be planted with peanuts and sunflowers, and many lands in southern China can be planted with rapeseed and perennial castor beans. Autumn crops such as corn and sorghum can also be intercropped with soybeans. Planting a large number of walnuts, tea oil, pepper, and tung trees in mountainous areas, and developing the production of oil palm and coconut and other oil crops in subtropical areas will have great benefits.

    The state's policy is to encourage farmers to increase the planting of oil crops. During this year's spring plowing, all localities should widely publicize the state's policy of encouraging farmers to increase the planting of oil crops to improve farmers' enthusiasm for producing oil. When rapeseed was sown in the winter of 1954, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces publicized the policy of fixed production and fixed purchase in concentrated oil producing areas, and the policy of fixed production and non-fixed purchase in general producing areas, which achieved very good results. Farmers in those areas overfulfilled the sowing plan for oil crops. We should make it clear to the farmers that the state purchases oil according to the standard of general yield, and the excess production of farmers is handled according to the principle of purchasing a certain proportion or purchasing less. In the winter of 1954, many farmers who planted rapeseed happily said after understanding this policy: "Fixed production and fixed purchase are just right for our hearts. If we increase the production of rapeseed, we will not only complete the state's fixed purchase task, but also have a lot left for our own use." It can be seen that it is beneficial to both the country and themselves for farmers to strive to increase the production of oil.

    Of course, it is not an easy task to mobilize farmers who did not grow oil crops in the past to plant oil crops. This requires helping them change their farming habits and helping them overcome many difficulties. This requires telling farmers clearly that going from not growing oil to being self-sufficient in oil will bring them many conveniences, increase their income, and reduce many burdens on the country. This is a good thing that benefits both sides! As long as you are determined to grow oil crops, farming techniques can be learned quickly. All departments must support farmers in planting oil crops: supply departments should promptly arrange for the supply of oil seeds and fertilizers; credit departments should do a good job in lending. At present, many places still lack oil crop seeds, and supply and marketing departments should quickly find ways to supply them so as not to affect sowing. The agricultural sector should help farmers learn and improve the technology of planting oil crops, and carry out seed selection, rational fertilization, rhizobium dressing and other tasks. In the winter of 1954, many oil crops suffered from frost damage; therefore, it is very important to seize the time to guide farmers to do a good job in field management.

    Let all farmers and rural cadres act together and strive to complete the plan for planting oil crops!

### 农民们，家家都种油料作物

    农民们，家家都种油料作物
    最近一年多以来，我国食油的供应量逐渐不能充分满足城乡广大人民日益增长的需要。人民群众迫切要求采取有效的办法改变这种状况。而有效地改变这种状况的办法，就是增加油料作物的生产。现在正是准备和种植油料作物的季节。各地应该有计划、有组织地发动广大农民，根据当地土壤、气候等条件，努力增植油料作物，以便在一九五五年能够有更多的食油供应全国人民的需要。
    解决我国食油供应不足问题的有效办法，就是发动每一户农民都来种植油料作物。现在国内的食油消耗量，农村占三分之二，城市占三分之一。这就是说，多数的食油是农民消费了。但现在全国生产油料的，却是少数省份的少数农民。这些农民生产的油料，除自给以外，还要供给城市、工业区人民的需要和出口的需要，还要供应农村大多数不种植油料作物的农民的需要；如果单靠这一部分农民解决全国油料供不应求的问题，是不合理的，也是不可能的。因此，发展油料作物生产和解决食油问题的根本办法，就是发动过去大量种植油料作物的农民，努力增加生产，把更多的油料卖给国家；发动过去不种植油料作物的农民按照每人不超过一分地的标准来种植油料作物，首先争取自给，然后尽可能把多余的油料卖给国家。这样，国家掌握了大量的油料，能够充分供应城市、工业区的需要和出口的需要；有的农民能够作到油料自给，多数农民可以出售油料给国家。这就不但解决了农民食油不足的困难，而且减少了农民买油的开支，增加了卖油料的收入。
    上述要求的实现是完全可能的。现在我国参加互助合作组织的农民已占农民的大多数。组织起来的农民，尤其是农业生产合作社的社员，比较容易接受国家的计划，按照国家的要求进行生产。只要好好领导他们，每人种一分地的油料作物是不难作到的。因此，增加油料作物的生产，必须认真依靠互助合作组织，带动个体农民，这是完成计划的保证。
    在油料作物集中产区和一般产区，油料作物的增产潜力是很大的。我国油料作物的单位面积产量一般都还很低。这是因为许多农民过去一直把油料作物看作“副产物”，既不注意选种，又不注意施肥，更不注意改进耕作技术。许多经验证明，只要改变这种情况，油料作物的产量就能显著提高。四川省遂宁专区许多县选用“胜利油菜”优良品种，产量比一般油菜提高二分之一到三倍。一九五四年全国花生主要产区推广根瘤菌拌种法，一般都增产百分之十到十五。安徽湖东县农民余术芳在油菜田中合理施肥，精耕细作，所种油菜超过当地产量一倍多。各地只要认真总结和推广当地农民的丰产经验，加以推广，就可使单位面积产量大大提高。我国气候温和，从南到北都可种植各种油料作物，只要合理利用土地（如充分利用田边、地埂、路旁、沟沿、宅园空隙土地等），就能在不缩小粮棉种植面积的条件下，适当扩大油料作物的种植面积。此外，我国北方还有很多砂荒地可以种植花生和向日葵，南方有许多土地可以种植油菜和多年生蓖麻，大秋作物如玉米、高粱也可以和大豆间作。在山区大量种植核桃、油茶、花椒、油桐，在亚热带地区发展油棕、椰子等油料作物的生产，都会有很大的利益。
    国家的政策是鼓励农民增植油料作物的。在今年春耕中，各地应该向农民广泛宣传国家鼓励农民增植油料作物的政策，以提高农民生产油料的积极性。一九五四年冬天播种油菜的时候，江西、湖南、湖北等省在油料集中产区宣传定产、定购的政策，在一般产区宣传定产不定购的政策，收到很好的效果，那些地区农民种植的油料作物都超额完成了播种计划。我们应该向农民讲清楚，国家是按照一般产量的标准收购油料的，对于农民超额增产的部分，是按一定比例收购或少收购的原则处理。一九五四年冬天，许多种植油菜的农民，在明白了这个政策以后，都高兴地说：“定产、定购正合我们的心，我们增产了菜籽，不单完成国家的定购任务，还有许多留下自用。”可见，农民努力增产油料，对国家和对自己都是有好处的。
    当然，要发动过去不种油料作物的农民也来种植油料，这并不是一件很容易的事。这需要帮助他们改变耕作习惯，帮助他们克服许多困难。这就要向农民说清楚，由不种油料到油料自给，会给自己增加许多方便，增加许多收入，又会给国家减少许多负担，这是一件两美双全的好事情！只要下决心来种油料作物，耕作技术是可以很快学会的。各部门都要支援农民种植油料作物：供应部门应该及时作好油料种籽、肥料的调剂供应工作；信贷部门应该作好贷款的工作。目前有不少地方还缺乏油料作物的种籽，供销部门应该赶快设法供应，以免影响播种。农业部门应该帮助农民学会和改进种植油料作物的技术，进行选种、合理施肥、根瘤菌拌种等项工作。一九五四年冬播油料作物，有许多遭受了冻害；因此，抓紧指导农民作好田间管理工作更是十分重要的。
    全体农民和农村干部一致行动起来，为完成种植油料作物的计划而努力吧！
