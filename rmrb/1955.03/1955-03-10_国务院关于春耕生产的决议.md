    Resolution of the State Council on Spring Ploughing Production
    (Adopted at the Sixth Plenary Meeting of the State Council on March 3, 1955)
      (1) Our country's first Five-Year Plan has entered its third year. Successfully completing this year's agricultural production plan, so that agricultural production can largely adapt to the needs of national industrialization and the improvement of people's living standards, is one of the most important keys to realizing the first Five-Year Plan. In the first two years of the Five-Year Plan, agricultural production—mainly grain output—increased, but due to the impact of serious natural disasters, the original national production increase plan was not completed. Due to the development of industrial and mining enterprises and the increase in the urban population, the supply of commodity grain has also increased; the nearly 500 million agricultural population has seen preliminary improvements in their lives, and their grain consumption has grown even more; the textile, cigarette, and other light industries have developed, and the demand for industrial raw material crops such as cotton and tobacco has also expanded; in order to ensure the necessary imports of industrial equipment, a certain amount of agricultural products must also be exported in exchange. If the development of agricultural production cannot keep up, it will inevitably affect our country's first Five-Year Plan, affect the speed of national industrialization and the continued improvement of people's lives, thereby affecting the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. According to the national plan, in 1955, the total grain output is required to increase by 20 billion jin compared to 1954, the total cotton output to increase by approximately 4.5 million dan, and oil crops, tobacco, tea, silk, hemp, animal husbandry, and aquatic products to have corresponding increases. This task is serious, arduous, and must be completed. Now that the spring ploughing season has arrived, doing a good job of spring ploughing in a timely manner and completing the sowing and planting plan is the current urgent task, which has a decisive significance for completing this year's agricultural production increase plan. To this end, all levels of state administrative organs in all regions are required to promptly shift their work focus to spring ploughing production; regions where the unified purchase and sale of grain has not yet ended and regions where the conscription task has not yet been completed should also appropriately arrange cadre forces to promptly shift to focusing on leading spring ploughing production, combined with handling the remaining issues in the unified purchase work, conducting supplementary classes on unified sales, and completing the conscription task.
      (2) The agricultural production cooperative movement has developed relatively rapidly throughout the country over the past year. As of early February 1955, there were nearly 600,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and the number of peasant households participating in the cooperatives reached 15 million. The development of the movement is generally healthy and normal. Among them, the majority of the 100,000 old cooperatives established before the spring ploughing of 1954 have experienced varying degrees of production increase, universally demonstrating the superiority of the collective economy. This is an important aspect of carrying out the agricultural production movement and the greatest favorable condition for completing this year's agricultural production increase task.
    However, on the other hand, it must be pointed out that due to the rapid development of agricultural production cooperatives, our lack of experience, and insufficient preparation, there is still a lack of unified and detailed regulations on the specific policies of the cooperatives. Therefore, in practical work, it is inevitable that some places have failed to effectively implement the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and have not adequately taken care of the various issues related to the actual economic interests of the members, either causing poor peasants to suffer losses or harming the due interests of middle peasants; also, due to insufficient publicity or unclear explanations of the policies and steps of collectivization, even compulsory orders have occurred. Some places are eager to merge into large cooperatives, eager to implement the public ownership of livestock and farm tools, and prematurely reduce land remuneration, subjectively demanding to accelerate the transition to advanced cooperatives with a completely socialist nature, which has aroused suspicion and misunderstanding of collectivization among some peasants. After last year's autumn harvest, a large number of new cooperatives were established in a short period of time, and immediately became busy with grain work, while relaxing the rectification and consolidation of the cooperatives. Some new cooperatives have not dealt with or have improperly dealt with specific issues such as land appraisal and remuneration for draught animals; preparatory work for spring ploughing has not been arranged or has been arranged improperly; and some old cooperatives have increased production, pre-distributed grain, but have not settled accounts and have not officially affirmed the results of the distribution, which has also increased the concerns of the peasants and caused some adverse effects on production. At the same time, due to the shortcomings in the unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, and oil, the stagnation of the rural market, and the lack of smooth urban-rural exchange, coupled with the opportunity taken by a portion of landlords, rich peasants, and hidden counter-revolutionaries to spread rumors and sabotage, the production enthusiasm of a portion of peasants (mainly middle peasants) has become unstable, and they are not very enthusiastic about adding carts, buying horses, purchasing farm tools, tidying up land, and accumulating fertilizer to expand reproduction; serious phenomena such as a sharp drop in livestock prices, indiscriminate slaughter of draught animals, and indiscriminate felling of trees have also occurred in individual areas. These are very unfavorable to agricultural production.
      (3) In order to smoothly carry out the spring ploughing production movement and develop agricultural production, it is first necessary to strengthen the publicity and explanation of agricultural production cooperation policies, earnestly implement the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and correctly grasp the class policy of relying on poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) and firmly uniting with middle peasants. It is imperative to resolutely prevent rich peasant elements from infiltrating agricultural production cooperative organizations and developing disguised rich peasant exploitation within the cooperatives; similarly, it is imperative to resolutely prevent one-sided emphasis on taking care of poor peasants and infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. Within the cooperative, labor remuneration should be slightly higher than land remuneration, but it should not be too high, and land remuneration should not be too low. When cooperatives are first established, it is best to adopt the method of private ownership and public use of draught animals and farm tools, giving reasonable remuneration, and there is no need to rush to make them publicly owned by the cooperative; if there are those who voluntarily implement the public ownership of draught animals and farm tools by converting them into shares, they should also be converted at the normal market price, and the repayment period should not be too long. Members' pigs and sheep do not need to join the cooperative. Appropriate remuneration should be given for members' labor such as accumulating fertilizer and tidying up the land. With the exception of large-scale afforestation, which can be operated cooperatively, scattered fruit trees and trees may not join the cooperative; when calculating remuneration for trees that join the cooperative, it is necessary to consider the characteristic that the labor spent on cultivating trees yields no profit in the short term but yields greater profits in the long term, and combine it with the specific situation of the trees that join the cooperative to formulate appropriate remuneration methods, ensuring the reasonable benefits that tree planters should receive, in order to encourage peasants' enthusiasm for planting trees and afforestation. The distribution of production income from old cooperatives must also be done quickly in order to stabilize members' production enthusiasm and expand the influence of cooperatives among the masses. In short, when handling various issues within the cooperative, not only must the actual interests of all members be properly taken care of, but attention must also be paid to the impact on peasants outside the cooperative. At same time, in order to ensure the healthy and normal development of the agricultural production cooperative movement, the pace of the agricultural collectivization movement should be slowed down. Before the spring ploughing, the development of new cooperatives should be stopped, and efforts should be concentrated on rectifying the existing cooperatives around the central requirement of spring ploughing production, earnestly implementing the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, consolidating them, and arranging their production through work such as formulating production plans, organizing labor, and preparing seeds, feed, and fertilizer. Doing these tasks well is a great victory. At the same time, mutual aid teams that have been broken up due to the entry of some members into cooperatives should be reorganized, more mutual aid teams should be developed, and the production of mutual aid teams must also be carefully arranged. Rely on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to lead the vast number of peasants to launch a universal and enthusiastic spring ploughing production movement.
      (4) In order to smoothly launch the spring ploughing production movement, it is also necessary to properly arrange the rural market. The unified purchase and sale of grain is one of the important policies for implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and ensuring national industrialization, and it is in line with the interests of the vast number of peasants; judging from the results of the vast number of peasants actively selling grain and the completion of the national grain purchase plan, the national grain policy is supported by the vast number of peasants. However, there are still shortcomings in the work of unified purchase and sale of grain. The methods of unified purchase and sale of grain must also be improved. Based on the existing experience in grain purchase work, when arranging spring ploughing production this year, the grain purchase figures should be allocated to the townships, requiring each township to formulate its own production plan and grain sales plan based on the national agricultural production indicators. Once the unified purchase task is determined, if the year is normal, no matter how much production increases, it will not be changed. In the event of a serious disaster, the purchase figures in the disaster areas must be reduced accordingly. In order to ensure the grain supply in the disaster areas, more can be purchased in the bumper harvest areas, but the increase in purchase figures must not exceed 40 percent of the increased production. After the unified purchase task is completed, the surplus grain will be freely disposed of by the peasants, who can sell it to the state, freely trade it on the grain market under the leadership of the state, or use it for their own consumption or storage for disaster preparedness. This can greatly encourage peasants' enthusiasm for increasing production.
    After the start of spring ploughing, especially during the lean season, the supply of livestock feed and the grain ration supply for some grain-deficient peasants (especially in disaster areas and cash crop areas) will become prominent issues. If the supply is not timely, it will not only affect production, but also affect the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Grain departments and supply and marketing cooperative departments at all levels must be prepared, pay close attention, and solve problems in a timely manner. What should be supplied must be guaranteed. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure that less should be supplied if it should be, and not to supply if it should not be, in order to save grain. During the spring ploughing period, the supply of production materials such as farm tools and fertilizers and the transportation and regulation of draught animals must be done well. In cotton producing areas, pre-purchase work before cotton sowing should also be done in conjunction with the supply work.
    Small merchants and peddlers in rural areas and towns are also working people. They are mainly engaged in the transportation and processing of goods, earning meager remuneration, and should not be generally referred to as intermediate exploitation and opposed. At present, some places are expanding the scope of unified purchase materials at will and blindly excluding small merchants and peddlers, causing some blockages in urban-rural exchange, which is very unfavorable to rural production and must be changed in a timely manner. Comprehensive arrangements must be made for merchants and peddlers in rural areas and towns. Through the road of mutual aid and cooperation, small merchants and peddlers must be organized and led to expand urban-rural exchange and serve the needs of peasants' production and life during the spring ploughing period.
    While doing a good job of supply work during the spring ploughing period, it is also necessary to do a good job of issuing agricultural loans. Actively develop the deposit and lending business of credit cooperative organizations, concentrate rural idle funds, and combine them with agricultural loans to solve the need for spring ploughing production funds. Consolidating the existing 100,000 rural credit cooperatives through business activities during the spring ploughing period is also beneficial to the future development of credit cooperation.
      (5) The main way to increase agricultural production in our country at the present time is to rely on the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation to lead the vast number of peasants, take appropriate scientific and technological measures to increase production, tap the potential power of agriculture, and increase the yield per unit area. In order to ensure the completion of this year's production increase task, during the spring ploughing production movement, all regions should take the following production increase measures in combination with their local specific conditions:
    In the plain dry farming areas, do a good job in promoting new-style animal-powered farm tools such as double-wheeled double-furrow plows, ensuring quality, timely supply, teaching peasants how to use them, cultivating a large number of farm tool operators among peasants, and organizing local blacksmith shops and iron factories to help peasants repair and add parts. The research and improvement work of paddy field plows should also be seriously paid attention to. Old-fashioned farm tools needed for spring ploughing must be vigorously supplied. In some minority areas, iron farm tools are very scarce and must be helped to solve this problem.
    The requirements for increasing the number of draught animals and improving the quality of draught animals are becoming increasingly urgent with the promotion of new-style farm tools. For a considerable period of time, agricultural production will mainly rely on livestock and animal-powered farm tools. Any view that underestimates livestock and animal-powered farm tools is unrealistic, unfavorable to the development of agricultural production, and erroneous. It is imperative to vigorously breed livestock, improve livestock breeds, strengthen the prevention and treatment of animal diseases, and reduce livestock deaths. In addition to running state-owned farms, state-owned insemination stations, and veterinary undertakings well, it is imperative to unite, educate, and use folk veterinarians and livestock breeding households, and organize them to serve the protection and breeding of livestock. In order to develop livestock, it is also necessary to plant forage crops in a planned way on vacant land, fallow land, and abandoned land during the spring ploughing period; especially in areas where pig raising is more common, it is even more important to open up feed sources in this regard to overcome the current trend of reducing pig raising due to insufficient feed.
    Building water conservancy, promoting improved varieties, and applying fertilizer rationally are all important production increase measures. However, since the beginning of winter, some places have been busy with unified purchase of grain, conscription, and the development of cooperatives, and have relaxed the leadership of spring ploughing preparation work. Autumn ploughing, winter ploughing, winter water conservancy repairs, seed selection and retention, and fertilizer accumulation have not been done enough, and are not as good as in previous years. It is imperative to immediately seize the time to make up for this. The existing ponds, dams, canals, and embankments must be promptly organized for inspection and repair by the masses. In particular, it is necessary to be good at using the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the masses, adhere to the principle of public-private cooperation, widely build small-scale water conservancy projects, increase the irrigated area, and prevent flooding and drought. Check the preparation of seeds and do a good job of seed regulation work for seed-deficient areas and seed-deficient peasants; the promotion of improved varieties should also be actively carried out. In addition to organizing peasants to exchange improved varieties with each other, agricultural departments should cooperate with grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives to supply improved varieties in a planned way, overcoming the spontaneous phenomenon in the promotion of improved varieties in some places. On the other hand, the blindness of individual places importing new varieties from afar and promoting them directly to the masses without farm trials, causing losses to the masses, must also be corrected. The source of commercial fertilizer is limited and can only be supplied to key areas; it is imperative to implement the principle of natural fertilizer as the main source, vigorously call on and organize the masses to open up fertilizer sources from green manure, barnyard manure, and human and animal excrement, expand the area of fertilizer application; especially in areas where winter fertilizer accumulation is poor, it is even more necessary to seize the time to accumulate and produce fertilizer, and improve fertilizer application methods to ensure increased agricultural production.
    In order to rapidly increase grain output, it is imperative to actively advocate the planting of various high-yield crops, such as potatoes, corn, and rice, while maintaining a general balance in the needs of commodity grain varieties. In places where the grain yield per unit area is low, it is even more necessary to advocate this in a planned way before sowing and actively make preparations in terms of seeds and technology. There are also some effective methods for improving cultivation techniques and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests in various places, which should be actively promoted. Agricultural departments at all levels should cooperate with relevant departments to develop the production of pesticides and machinery in a planned way, and do a good job in the supply of pesticides and machinery, first fully supplying peasants with pesticides for seed dressing to meet their needs for spring ploughing and sowing. In order to prevent the spread of plant diseases and insect pests, plant quarantine work must be established from this year onwards with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner.
    In order to ensure the earnest implementation of the above agricultural production increase measures, it is imperative to strengthen the leadership of technical extension stations and improve the quality of technical extension station cadres. Cadres at every technical extension station must learn the working methods of the mass line in order to actively promote these measures among the masses and avoid the mistakes of compulsory orders.
    (6) Due to the rare flood in the Yangtze and Huai River basins in 1954, many disaster areas also experienced extremely heavy snowfall in winter, making it difficult to restore production; in addition, some areas suffered frost disasters in winter, resulting in large losses of overwintering crops and livestock. Doing a good job in the spring ploughing production work in these disaster areas is a serious task. It is imperative to continue to give play to the tenacious spirit of fighting the floods last year, first concentrate efforts on doing a good job in dike restoration and gap closure, and repairing farmland water conservancy projects, striving for timely sowing. There are still a few areas where water has not receded, and efforts must be made to drain the water, level the land, and restore farmland. In terms of the arrangement of time and labor, mutual aid and cooperative organizations should be well used, with appropriate division of labor, so that dike restoration and production are not delayed.
    The seed regulation work in disaster areas must be done effectively before sowing. When transporting seeds, it is imperative to try to prevent the spread of plant diseases and insect pests. At the same time, due to excessive rainfall and imbalanced climate last year, and also due to poor protection during transportation, some of the seeds that were transported, especially some cotton seeds, were of relatively poor quality and had a low germination rate. Therefore, the amount of seed used must be increased and properly treated before sowing.
    The loss of draught animals in disaster areas is very large, and feed is also scarce, so more attention must be paid to protecting draught animals. Draught animal regulation is the current urgent task in disaster areas, and supply and marketing cooperative departments must be good at leading, educating, and organizing the use of livestock traders in rural areas to carry out this work.
    It is imperative to lead the masses in disaster areas to produce and help themselves in a planned way, educate disaster victims to overcome their dependence mentality, explain the principle that "relief is limited, production is infinite," help disaster victims solve the problems of production raw materials and product sales, and encourage their enthusiasm for producing and helping themselves. And do a good job of timely distribution of relief grain and agricultural loans, overcome complacency, and prevent the expansion of disasters.
    It is imperative to strengthen epidemic prevention and sanitation work and public security work in disaster areas to prevent the occurrence of human and animal diseases and maintain social order, so as not to affect spring ploughing production.
    (7) Mountainous area production must also have a comprehensive plan. Without destroying soil and water conservation, mountainous areas can also develop agricultural production and need to strive for grain self-sufficiency. However, the content of mountainous area production cannot be purely agricultural production, and it should generally be a combination of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, developing a variety of economies. Some mountainous areas are currently dominated by forestry or animal husbandry. Although some mountainous areas are still mainly dependent on agricultural income, forestry and animal husbandry must be gradually developed in order to develop the mountainous area economy, increase the income of the people in mountainous areas, and change the impoverished face of mountainous areas. Spring is the season for planting trees and afforestation, and tree planting in mountainous areas must be seized tightly. The leadership of fishery production in coastal fishing areas and freshwater fishing areas must also be strengthened, and the supply of materials such as oil, hemp, and wood needed for fishermen to repair boats and mend nets must be done effectively. In the past, some places mechanically applied a set of requirements and measures from general agricultural areas to lead mountainous area production, or emphasized agricultural production as the center in fishing areas, which is not correct and must be corrected.
      (8) In order to do a good job in the current spring ploughing production work and complete this year's agricultural production increase task, local people's committees and agricultural departments at all levels must immediately assign a group of capable cadres to go deep into the countryside with emphasis to inspect and assist in spring ploughing production work.
    At the same time, in order to complete this year's agricultural production increase task and also lay the foundation for long-term leadership of agricultural production, local people's committees and agricultural departments at all levels are required to analyze and study the farming situation of the local peasant masses based on the local soil, climate, rainfall, water conditions, and other natural conditions, find the key to increasing production, and formulate specific and feasible production increase measures that are suitable for local conditions, promote them in steps and in a planned way. The grasp of the situation may not be specific enough or comprehensive enough at the beginning, and the situation can be collected at any time in practice, supplemented with materials, and gradually made specific and comprehensive. The measures proposed at the beginning may not be complete enough or accurate enough, and experience can be summarized at any time, shortcomings can be corrected, and gradually made complete and accurate. This is a basic task for improving and strengthening the leadership of agricultural production, and all provinces and counties must do it effectively. The Ministry of Agriculture must organize this work in a planned way and collect and organize the information from each province and county to "have a clear idea." With a grasp of the situation related to agricultural production, grasping the key to increasing production, proposing specific and practical production increase measures, and constantly discovering new problems, constantly supplementing and correcting, and constantly proposing new and further production increase measures in practice, the victory in the realization of the agricultural production increase plan will be guaranteed.
    Finally, the State Council calls on all members of agricultural production cooperatives, members of mutual aid teams, and all peasants, as well as all staff and workers of state-owned farms and rural work cadres, to act immediately, give play to a high degree of labor enthusiasm, devote themselves to spring ploughing production, and strive to complete and overfulfill the production increase tasks of grain, cotton, oil, and various other agricultural products, in order to support national industrialization, strengthen the country's defense capabilities, and support socialist construction.

    国务院关于春耕生产的决议
    （一九五五年三月三日国务院全体会议第六次会议通过）
      （一）我国第一个五年建设计划已经进入第三年，胜利完成今年的农业生产计划，使农业生产能够大体适应国家工业化和人民生活水平提高的需要，是实现第一个五年建设计划的重要关键之一。五年计划的头两年，农业生产——主要是粮食产量虽有增加，但由于严重的自然灾害的影响，并没有完成国家原定的增产计划。由于工矿企业的发展和城市人口的增加，商品粮食的供应量也随着增加；农业人口近五万万人，他们的生活初步改善了，粮食的消费量增长更大；纺织、卷烟等轻工业发展了，棉花、烟叶等工业原料作物的需要量也跟着扩大；为保证必要的工业装备进口，又不能不输出一定数量的农产品去交换。农业生产的发展如果跟不上去，势必会影响我国第一个五年建设计划，影响国家工业化的速度和人民生活的继续改善，从而影响工农联盟的巩固。按照国家的计划，一九五五年要求粮食总产量较一九五四年增加二百亿斤，棉花总产量增加约四百五十万担，油料、烟、茶、桑、麻、畜牧和水产等都要有相应的增加。这个任务是严重的，艰巨的，又是必须完成的。现在春耕季节已经到来，及时做好春耕工作，完成播种和种植计划，是当前的迫切任务，对于完成今年的农业增产计划具有决定的意义。为此，要求各地各级国家行政机关把工作中心及时转移到春耕生产方面来；粮食统购统销工作尚未结束的地区和征集兵员任务尚未完成的地区，也应适当地安排干部力量，及时转入以领导春耕生产为中心，结合处理统购工作中的遗留问题，进行统销补课，并完成兵员征集的任务。
      （二）农业生产合作运动，一年来在全国范围内有了比较迅速的发展。到一九五五年二月初，已经有近六十万个农业生产合作社，入社的农民已达一千五百万户，运动的发展基本上是健康的正常的。其中在一九五四年春耕以前建立的十万个老社，大多数都有不同程度的增产，普遍地显示了集体经济的优越性。这是开展农业生产运动的一个重要方面，也是完成今年农业增产任务的一个最大的有利条件。
    但另一方面，必须指出：由于农业生产合作社发展较快，而我们经验不足，准备不够，对于合作社的各项具体政策还缺乏统一详明的规定，因而在实际工作中就难免有些地方未能切实贯彻自愿互利的原则，在处理有关社员实际经济利益的种种问题时照顾不周，或者使贫农吃亏，或者损害中农应得的利益；也由于对合作化的政策和步骤宣传不够或解释不很恰当，甚至发生强迫命令的错误，有些地方急于并大社，急于实行牲畜农具归社公有，过早降低土地报酬，主观要求加速过渡到完全社会主义性质的高级合作社，以致引起部分农民对合作化的怀疑和误解。去年秋收前后各地在短促时间内建立起一大批新社，紧接着就忙于粮食工作，而放松了对合作社的整顿和巩固。有的新社对土地评产和耕畜报酬等具体问题未做处理或处理不当，备耕工作未做安排或安排不周；还有少数老社增了产，预分了粮食，但没有结算账目，没有把分配的结果正式肯定下来，这也增加了农民的顾虑，引起了某些对生产不利的影响。同时又因为粮、棉、油统购统销工作中的缺点和农村市场停滞、城乡交流不畅等原因，再加上一部分地主富农分子和潜藏的反革命分子乘机造谣破坏，就造成了一部分农民（主要是中农）的生产情绪不够稳定，对于添车买马、购置农具、整理土地、增积肥料以扩大再生产的积极性不高；个别地区还出现了畜价狂跌、滥宰耕畜和乱伐树木等严重现象。这些，对于农业生产是很不利的。
      （三）为顺利开展春耕生产运动，发展农业生产，首先就必须加强农业生产合作政策的宣传解释工作，认真贯彻自愿互利的原则，正确掌握依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农）、巩固地团结中农的阶级政策。必须坚决防止富农分子混入农业生产合作组织，在合作社内发展变相的富农剥削；同样必须坚决防止片面强调照顾贫农，侵犯中农利益。在合作社内，劳力报酬应稍高于土地报酬，但也不宜过高，土地报酬不宜过低。合作社初办时，耕畜农具最好采取私有公用的方式，给以合理报酬，不必急于归社公有；如有自愿将耕畜农具实行折价归社公有者，亦应按正常市价折价，偿还期限不能拖得太长。社员的猪羊不必入社。对社员积肥、整地等劳动，都应该给适当的报酬。除大片造林可以合作经营外，零星的果树和林木可不入社；对入社的树木计算报酬时，必须考虑到栽培树木所花的劳动短期无收益而在长时期后收益较大的这个特点，结合入社林木的具体情况，订出适当的计酬办法，保证栽树者应得的合理收益，以鼓励农民植树造林的积极性。老社生产收益的分配工作也要迅速做好，以稳定社员的生产情绪，扩大合作社在群众中的影响。总之，处理社内各种问题，不仅要妥善照顾所有社员的实际利益，而且必须切实注意对社外农民的影响。同时为了保证农业生产合作运动健康的正常的发展，农业合作化运动的步骤应放慢一些。在春耕以前，应停止发展新社，集中力量围绕着春耕生产这一中心要求来整顿现有的社，认真贯彻自愿互利的原则，把它们巩固下来，并通过订生产计划、组织劳动力、准备种子饲料和肥料等工作，把它们的生产安排好。把这些工作做好，就是一个很大的胜利。同时，还应当把那些因部分组员入社而拆散了的互助组重新组织起来，发展更多的互助组，对互助组的生产也必须认真地加以安排。依靠农业生产合作社和互助组带动广大农民，掀起一个普遍热烈的春耕生产运动。
      （四）为顺利展开春耕生产运动，还必须妥善安排农村市场。粮食统购统销是实行农业社会主义改造和保证国家工业化的重要政策之一，是符合广大农民利益的；从广大农民踊跃售粮和国家的粮食收购计划完成的结果看，国家的粮食政策是得到广大农民拥护的。但是，在粮食统购统销工作中还是有缺点的。粮食统购统销的方法也还要加以改进。根据粮食统购工作已有的经验，在今年布置春耕生产时，就把粮食统购数字分配到乡，要求各乡根据国家农业生产的指标制定本乡的生产计划和本乡的粮食出售计划。统购任务确定之后，如果年景正常，无论增产多少，不再变动。如遇严重灾荒，灾区的征购数字必须照减。为了保证灾区人民的粮食供应，可在丰收的地区多购一些，但增购数字不得超过增产部分的百分之四十。完成统购任务以后，余粮由农民自由处理，可以卖给国家，可以在国家领导下的粮食市场上自由交易，也可以自己食用或储存备荒。这就可以大大鼓励农民的增产积极性。
    春耕开始以后，特别在青黄不接的时期，牲口饲料和某些缺粮农民的口粮供应（特别在灾区和经济作物区）将成为突出的问题。如果供应失时，不仅将影响生产，而且将影响粮食统购统销政策的贯彻，影响工农联盟的巩固。各级粮食部门和供销合作部门必须做好准备，密切注意，及时解决。该供应的，须保证供应。同时，也要做到：该少供应的，不多供应；不该供应的，就不供应，以节约粮食。春耕期间，农具、肥料等生产资料供应工作和耕畜贩运调剂工作必须做好。在棉产区，并应结合供应工作做好棉花播种前的预购工作。
    农村和城、镇中的小商小贩也是劳动人民，他们主要是从事商品的运输劳动和加工劳动，获取微薄的报酬，不应该一概称之为中间剥削，加以反对。目前，有的地方随便扩大统购物资的范围，盲目排斥小商小贩，造成城乡交流某些阻塞现象，这对于农村生产是非常不利的，必须及时加以改变。必须对农村和城、镇商贩做全面的安排，通过互助合作道路，把小商小贩组织起来，领导他们扩大城乡交流，为春耕时期农民生产和生活的需要服务。
    在做好春耕期间供应工作的同时，还须做好农业贷款的发放工作。积极开展信用合作组织的存放业务，把农村游资集中起来，结合着农业贷款，解决春耕生产资金的需要。通过春耕生产期间的业务活动，把现有的十多万个农村信用合作社巩固起来，对信用合作今后的发展也是有利的。
      （五）我国目前时期农业增产的主要途径是依靠发展农业生产互助合作，带动广大农民，采取适当的科学技术的增产措施，挖掘农业的潜在力量，提高单位面积产量。为了保证完成今年的增产任务，在春耕生产运动中，各地应结合当地具体条件采取下列增产措施：
    在平原旱作地区做好双轮双铧犁等新式畜力农具的推广工作，做到保证质量，供应及时，教会农民使用，在农民中培养出大批农具手，并组织当地铁匠炉和铁工厂帮助农民修理和添配零件。水田犁的研究改进工作也要认真注意。春耕所需要的旧式农具必须大力供应。在某些少数民族地区，铁制农具很缺，必须帮助解决。
    发展耕畜数量和提高耕畜质量的要求，随着新式农具的推广而日渐迫切。在相当长的时期内，农业生产主要还是靠牲畜和畜力农具，任何轻视牲畜和畜力农具的观点都是不实际的，不利于发展农业生产的，都是错误的。必须大力繁殖牲畜，改良牲畜品种，加强防治兽疫，减少牲畜死亡。除办好国营牧场、国营配种站和兽医事业外，必须团结教育和使用民间兽医和喂养种畜户，组织他们为保护和繁殖牲畜服务。为发展牲畜，还须在春耕期间有计划地利用隙地、休闲地和废弃土地种植饲料作物；特别是养猪较多的地区，更要从这方面开辟饲料来源，以克服目前因饲料不足而减少喂猪的趋势。
    兴修水利，推广良种，合理施肥，都是重要的增产措施。但是入冬以来，有些地方因忙于统购粮食、征集兵员和发展合作社，而放松了春耕准备工作的领导，秋耕冬耕、水利冬修、选种留种和积肥等等都做得不够，不如往年，必须立即抓紧补课。对原有的塘坝渠堰必须及时组织群众加以检查和补修，尤其要善于运用群众的人力物力和财力，本民办公助的方针，广泛兴修小型水利，增加灌溉面积，防涝抗旱。检查种子的准备情况，做好对缺种地区和缺种农民的种子调剂工作；良种推广工作也应该积极进行，除组织农民相互串换良种以外，农业部门应该协同粮食部门、供销合作社有计划地供应良种，克服某些地方在良种推广工作中的自流现象。另一方面，个别地方远程调进新的品种，不经农场试验，直接推广到群众中去，使群众受到损失，这种盲目性也要纠正。商品肥料来源有限，只能重点供应；必须贯彻自然肥料为主的方针，大力号召组织群众从绿肥、厩肥和人粪人尿等方面开辟肥源，扩大施肥面积；尤其是冬季积肥较差的地区，更须抓紧时间积肥造肥，并改善施肥方法，保证农业增产。
    为迅速提高粮食产量，应该在保持商品粮食品种需要大体平衡的前提下，积极提倡多种高产作物，如薯类、玉米、水稻等。粮食单位面积产量较低的地方，更须在播种前有计划地加以提倡，并积极在种子和技术方面做好准备。在改进耕作技术和防治病虫害方面，各地也有一些行之有效的办法，应该积极推广。各级农业部门应协同有关部门有计划地发展农药械的生产，做好农药械的供应工作，首先以拌种用的农药充分供应农民，满足农民春耕播种的需要。为防止病虫害的蔓延，植物检疫工作必须从今年起有重点、有步骤地建立起来。
    为保证上述各项农业增产措施的认真贯彻，必须加强对技术推广站的领导工作，提高技术推广站干部的质量，每一个技术推广站的干部必须学习群众路线的工作方法，才能在群众中积极推行这些措施，而又避免强迫命令的错误。
    （六）由于一九五四年长江淮河地区遭受了百年少有的洪水，许多灾区冬季又降雪特大，恢复生产的困难很多；另有些地区在冬季遭受冻灾，越冬作物和牲畜的损失很大。做好这些灾区的春耕生产工作，是一项严重的任务。必须继续发挥去年跟洪水战斗的顽强精神，首先集中力量，做好复堤堵口、抢修农田水利，争取及时播种。还有少数地区积水未退，要大力排除积水，平整土地，恢复农田。在时间和劳力的安排上，应很好运用互助合作组织，适当分工，作到复堤、生产两不误。
    灾区的种子调剂工作，必须在播种前切实做好。调运种子时，必须尽力防止病虫害的传播蔓延。同时，由于去年雨水过多，气候失调，也由于调运中保护不周，有些调进的种子，特别是一部分棉花种子，质量较次，发芽率不高，故须增加用种量，并在播种前加以适当处理。
    灾区耕畜损失很大，饲料又缺，更要注意保护耕畜。耕畜调剂是灾区当前的紧急任务，供销合作部门必须善于领导、教育和组织使用农村中的牲畜贩子来开展这一工作。
    必须有计划地领导灾区群众生产自救，教育灾民克服依赖思想，说明“救济有限，生产无穷”的道理，帮助灾民解决生产原料和产品销路问题，鼓舞灾民生产自救的积极性。并做好救济粮款和农贷的及时发放工作，克服麻痹大意思想，防止灾情扩大。
    必须加强灾区的防疫卫生工作和治安工作，防止人畜病疫的发生，保持社会秩序的安定，以免影响春耕生产。
    （七）山区生产也要有通盘的规划。在不破坏水土保持的前提下，山区也可以发展农业生产，也需要争取粮食自给。但是，山区生产的内容不能是单纯的农业生产，一般应该是农林牧相结合，发展多种经济。有的山区，当前就是以林业或牧业为主的。有的山区虽然当前仍以农业收入为主，但必须逐步发展林业和牧业，才能发展山区经济，增加山区人民的收入，改变山区贫瘠的面貌。春季正是植树造林的季节，山区植树尤须抓紧。沿海渔区和淡水渔区渔业生产的领导也要加强，切实做好渔民修船补网所需要的油、麻、木材等物资的供应工作。过去有的地方机械搬用一般农业地区的一套要求和措施去领导山区生产，或者在渔区也强调农业生产为中心，这种一般化的工作方法是不对的，必须纠正。
      （八）为做好当前的春耕生产工作，完成今年的农业增产任务，地方各级人民委员会和农业部门必须立即抽派一批得力干部，有重点地深入到农村中去，检查和帮助春耕生产工作。
    同时，为完成今年的农业增产任务，也为长期领导农业生产打下基础，要求地方各级人民委员会和农业部门，根据当地的土壤、气候、雨量、水情等自然条件，分析研究当地农民群众耕作的情况，找出增产的关键，制定适合当地情况的切实可行的具体增产措施方案，分开步骤，有计划地推行。开始对于情况的掌握可能不够具体，不很全面，可以在实践中随时搜集情况，补充资料，逐步做到具体和全面。开始提出的措施方案可能不够完整，不很准确，可以随时总结经验，修正缺点，逐步做到完整和准确。这是改进和加强农业生产领导工作的一项基本工作，要求各省各县必须切实做好。农业部必须有计划地组织这一工作，并把各省各县的资料汇集整理起来，做到“心中有数”。掌握了有关农业生产的情况，抓住了增产关键，提出具体的切合实际的增产措施，并且在实践中随时发现新的问题，随时补充和修正，随时提出新的更进一步的增产措施，那么农业增产计划的胜利实现就有了保证。
    最后，国务院号召所有农业生产合作社的社员、互助组组员和全体农民以及国营农场的全体职工和农村工作干部立即行动起来，发挥高度的劳动热情，投入春耕生产，为完成和超额完成粮食、棉花、油料和其他各种农产品的增产任务而斗争，以支援国家工业化，增强祖国的国防力量，支援社会主义建设。
