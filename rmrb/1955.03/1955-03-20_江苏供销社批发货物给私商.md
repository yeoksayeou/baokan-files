Jiangsu Supply and Marketing Cooperative Wholesales Goods to Private Merchants
In order to invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province are gradually establishing and expanding wholesale business with private merchants. At present, there are mainly three ways for various places to wholesale goods to private merchants: First, the native and special products and sideline products operated by the county supply and marketing cooperative are wholesaled to private merchants; second, the district supply and marketing cooperative purchases industrial products, native and special products, and sideline products from state-owned companies and county supply and marketing cooperatives, and then wholesales them to private merchants; third, the primary-level supply and marketing cooperative introduces private merchants to purchase goods directly from state-owned companies and county supply and marketing cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, 57 county cooperatives, 298 district cooperatives, and 167 primary-level cooperatives in the province have carried out wholesale business with private merchants. According to statistics from 17 county cooperatives and 49 district cooperatives, various materials wholesaled to private merchants and peddlers are worth a total of 699,700 yuan. At present, various places are widely establishing wholesale agencies for private merchants and gradually expanding wholesale business with private merchants.

When supply and marketing cooperatives in various places wholesale goods to private merchants, they generally give appropriate consideration to private merchants and peddlers in terms of goods distribution. For example, when Jiangdu County distributes fast-selling goods, it generally gives private merchants about 30% to 40%. This has appropriately increased the turnover of private merchants and peddlers, overcome their living difficulties, and further met the needs of the peasants. (Niu Wanyu)

    江苏供销社批发货物给私商
    江苏省各地供销合作社为了活跃城乡物资交流，正在逐步建立和扩大对私商的批发业务。现在各地对私商批发货物的方式主要有三种：一种是县供销合作社经营的土产特产品和副业产品，对私商批发；第二种是区供销合作社从国营公司和县供销合作社采购工业品和土产特产品、副业产品回来，转批给私商；第三种是基层供销合作社介绍私商直接向国营公司和县供销合作社进货。据不完全统计，全省已经有五十七个县社、二百九十八个区社、一百六十七个基层社开展了对私商的批发业务。据其中十七个县社和四十九个区社的统计，批给私商小贩的各种物资，共值六十九万九千七百多元。目前，各地正在广泛建立对私商的批发机构，逐步扩大对私商的批发业务。
    各地供销合作社对私商批发货物时，一般都在货源分配方面给了私商小贩适当的照顾。如江都县分配热销货的时候，一般都给私商百分之三十到四十左右。这样，就使私商小贩适当增加了营业额，克服了生活困难，农民们的需要也得到了进一步的满足。　（牛万裕）
