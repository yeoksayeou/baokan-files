    After the Agronomist Became the Chairman of the Collective Farm
    Soviet Union　Ge· Wofuke
    Five years ago, we met Konstantin Zhibenko in the Ukrainian Ministry of Agriculture. Although he was still young at that time, he was already the section chief in a very large management bureau. Shortly after we met, I heard that Zhibenko had submitted an application requesting to be sent to work on a collective farm. He left Kiev and went to one of the most backward collective farms in the Polesie region of Sumy Oblast.
    That's how he arrived in the village of Pogrebki, located on the east bank of the Dnieper River in the northernmost part of the Ukrainian Polesie region. The climate here is warm and humid, but the soil is gray—sandy soil, gravel soil, and alkaline soil lacking organic matter, as well as acidic soil.
    The “Bolshevik” collective farm in Pogrebki village has a land area of 4,000 hectares, of which 2,565 hectares are arable land, and pastures and hayfields account for approximately 700 hectares. Such a large land area, if it can be well utilized, can enable this farm to develop greatly, planting a lot of grains, industrial crops, vegetables, and feed crops. Working on this land are 700 men and women collective farm members with labor power, and the state-owned machine tractor station also regularly helps this collective farm.
    This jointly operated collective farm is large in scale and complex in its operations: it has two dairy farms and two pig farms, as well as sheep farms, horse farms, and poultry farms; various processing workshops, mills, power stations, and brick factories. However, the income obtained by this collective farm, whether from farming or other business sectors, is not much—no more than 300,000 rubles a year. Grain harvests are less than ten quintals, and each hectare of hemp can only yield two or three quintals. The milk production of dairy cows is also very limited.
    Agronomist Zhibenko came to this collective farm with ambitious plans and great hopes. After looking at the collective farm's crops and land, it was clear to him how to improve the fertility of the soil here. If he worked hard, he would definitely achieve good results.
    He began to inquire of the collective farm members:
      “Have you ever grown wheat here?”
      “We haven’t tried it,” the older collective farm members replied, “Wheat can’t grow on our land.”
    “If you want to grow it, it will grow,” the agronomist said with confidence.
    However, no one believed what he said. At different times, multiple attempts were made in Pogrebki village to improve the fertility of this barren land and increase the yield of livestock products. However, none of them succeeded, because many things could not be persisted in to the end, and at the same time, there was a lack of practical knowledge. What hindered the development of the collective farm the most was the lack of necessary organization. Labor discipline also did not reach a high level.
    At the regularly held work summary and re-election meeting, the collective farm members abandoned their trust in the original collective farm chairman and unanimously decided to have Konstantin Zhibenko lead the collective farm. He recognized the importance of this position and accepted everyone's trust in him. The outstanding ability of this new leader was quickly demonstrated: he was good at organizing everyone and arousing their deep concern for the development of the collective farm.
    He summoned activists, young people, and livestock breeders, held collective farm member conferences, exchanged opinions with them, and put forward clear tasks: to strengthen work teams, do a good job in accounting, and improve labor discipline. The original six not-so-large field work teams were reorganized into three teams, and in addition, several specialized work teams were established—a feeding work team, a horticultural work team, a peat extraction work team, a machine repair engineering team, and four livestock breeding work teams. Experienced, most prestigious, and upright collective farm members were assigned to lead these work teams. The Party organization assigned 14 of its 17 members and probationary members to resolutely plunge into production. Female Communist Party member Anna Nianghe served as the captain of the field work team, and the experienced old administrator Sergei Fadong served as the captain of the feeding work team. Communist Youth League members and other most capable and best-educated young men and women all served as leaders of various work groups, leading statisticians and milkmaids.
    Konstantin Zhibenko would not let anyone be indifferent to the common cause. He invited some elderly people to solicit their opinions on plans to improve soil fertility and transform the farm.
    He said to the elderly, "If we can find limestone near the fallow land, we can put it into the soil to reduce the acidity in the soil. Then we can grow wheat and corn."
    The elderly enthusiastically responded to Zhibenko's call. They discovered rich limestone deposits near Pogrebki, along the Desna River, which are of great help in neutralizing the soil. At that time, there was no grinding machine. Initially, the elderly used hammers to smash it into powder. Now, they have seen that machines can grind the limestone very finely.
    The situation in Pogrebki village gradually began to improve. The fertility of the land increased year by year. The collective farm put limestone into the soil, using lupine as green manure, planting it deep underground, and leaving part of it as livestock feed. Each hectare of lupine can produce 400 quintals of green manure, or 18 quintals of beans, which can be ground into flour for good livestock feed. The remaining roots of lupine after harvesting can make the soil gradually fertile. Year by year, the collective farm applied more inorganic and organic fertilizers to the land.
      The first batch of autumn-sown wheat, sown in the autumn of 1950, yielded 17 quintals per hectare. In 1952, the wheat sown area reached 225 hectares, with a yield of 18.4 quintals per hectare. Now the autumn-sown wheat sown area in this collective farm has reached 500 hectares, and each hectare can harvest 20 to 25 quintals of grain.
    The harvest of hemp has also been greatly improved. The areas planted with hemp have been layered with very rich fertilizers. Now the advanced collective farm young female members Takiyanna Zamorskaya and Yevdotia Oslach's hemp planting group can harvest 20 quintals of hemp per hectare, and the average yield on the entire sown area of this collective farm is 13 to 15 quintals per hectare. The area planted with hemp has not been expanded, but the hemp harvested by this collective farm has increased fourfold compared to 1950. The hemp handed over to state-owned factories is pure, thin, and long. Many bonuses were awarded to increase production. Hemp has become one of the farm's highest incomes. Last year, it earned three million rubles from the sale of hemp, an increase of 24 times compared to 1950.
    Konstantin Zhibenko resolutely and boldly encouraged all collective farm members to fight for improving cultivation techniques. All ear crops completely adopted the cross-sowing method, hemp was planted with narrow row spacing, and cultivated crops were planted with the square-cluster method. High-quality varieties must be selected for sowing. At the same time, artificial pollination of plants should be adopted.
    In addition to Konstantin Zhibenko, there are now eleven experts working on this collective farm. In total, there are eight professional agronomists, one animal husbandry expert, one veterinarian, and two assistant veterinarians.
    In recent years, the number of cattle and sheep in the livestock farms has more than doubled, and the production of their products has also increased. About half of the dairy cows are purebred Lebedin cattle. Milkmaids Yevdotia Korotchenko and Yelizaveta Vasina milked 3,000 liters of milk per year. More than 300 pigs are raised each year. In terms of poultry farming, a total of more than 3,000 chickens, ducks, and geese are raised. Rabbit farms have also been established. The number of beehives in the apiary has doubled. Fish ponds have been built, and the collective farm members have raised many silkworms. In the past year alone, they earned 100,000 rubles from the sale of silkworm cocoons. In recent years, the area of orchards has doubled. More than 30 hectares of apples, pears, and plums were planted in the autumn of last year alone.
    In 1951, the income of the collective farm's public economy was 1.1 million rubles, in 1953 it was 5.1 million rubles, and by 1954, it had increased to 8 million rubles.
    Now the face of Pogrebki has become unrecognizable. Everyone is actively and diligently working for the common cause.
    The collective farm members can receive monthly cash wage advances. Stableman Denis Moiseyko's family has three people with labor power. At the end of last year's distribution, they received three and a half tons of grain, half a ton of potatoes, half a ton of vegetables, feed, and 17,300 rubles in cash. Ivan Sershchuk's family received three tons of grain, 15,300 rubles in cash, and many other products. In addition, every collective farm member who diligently overfulfills the plan received additional income—milkmaids received 1,500 to 2,000 liters of milk, pig farmers received 150 to 200 kilograms of pork, and so on. Now, no one is indifferent to common labor anymore. In the past year, each collective farm member completed an average of 456 workdays.
    Agronomist Konstantin Zhibenko armed himself with the Communist Party's decisions on developing agriculture, and used his knowledge and creative labor to help the collective farm members of Pogrebki transform their large-scale operations. In the past few election campaigns for the Soviet Supreme, collective farm members recommended their leader as a candidate for representative and unanimously elected him as a representative.

    农艺师当了集体农庄主席以后
    苏联　格·沃夫克
    五年以前，我们在乌克兰农业部里认识了康士坦丁·齐宾柯。虽然那时他还很年青，可是已经在一个规模很大的管理局里担任科长了。在我们认识以后不久，我就听说齐宾柯提出了请求派他到集体农庄去工作的申请书。他离开了基辅，到苏姆省坡列西地方一个最落后的集体农庄里去了。
    他就这样来到了波格列布基村，这个村子在第聂伯河东岸乌克兰地区坡列西最北部的地方。这里的气候很温暖，而且潮湿，可是土壤却是灰色的——缺乏有机物质的砂土地、砂石地和碱地，同时也还有酸性土。
    波格列布基村“布尔什维克”集体农庄拥有四千公顷的土地面积，其中可耕地占二千五百六十五公顷，牧场和割草场约占七百公顷。这样大的土地面积，如能够很好地利用它，就可以使这个农场有很大发展，种植很多的谷物，技术作物、蔬菜和饲料作物。在这片土地上干活的——有七百个有劳动能力的男女庄员，国家机器拖拉机站还经常地来帮助这个集体农庄。
    这个共同经营的集体农庄规模很大，而且经营的内容也很复杂：有两处牛奶场和两处养猪场，还有养羊场、养马场和家禽饲养场；各种各样的制作场、磨坊、发电站、砖厂。但是，这个集体农庄无论是从农作方面或是所经营的其他部门方面所获得的收入并不多——一年之中不过三十万卢布。谷物的收获还不及十公担，每一公顷大麻只能收两三公担。奶牛的产奶量也很有限。
    农艺师齐宾柯带着庞大的计划和抱着很大的希望来到这个集体农庄。他看了看集体农庄的庄稼和土地以后，就已经很清楚，必须用怎样的方法来提高这里的土壤的肥力。如果努力操作，一定会有很好的成绩的。
    他开始向集体农庄的庄员们打听：
      “你们这儿种过小麦吗？”“我们还没有试验过，”年纪大一些的庄员们回答说：“在我们这块地上是长不出麦子来的。”
    “如果要种，就会长出来的”，农艺师很有信心地说。
    可是，大家都不相信他说的。在不同的时期内，在波格列布基村进行了多次提高这块贫瘠的土地的肥力和牲畜产品产量的尝试。但是，都没有成功，因为很多事情不能坚持到底，同时又缺乏实际工作的知识。最阻碍集体农庄发展的，就是缺乏必要的组织性。劳动纪律也没有达到很高的水平。
    在照例举行的总结工作和改选大会上，集体农庄的庄员们放弃了对原来的集体农庄主席的信任，而一致决定由康士坦丁·齐宾柯来领导集体农庄。他认识到这个职务责任的重要性，而接受了大家对他的信任。这个新的领导者的卓越的能力很快地表现出来了：他善于把大家组织起来，并引起他们对集体农庄的发展的深切关怀。
    他把积极分子、青年人、牲畜饲养员召集起来，举行集体农庄庄员大会，和他们交换意见，并提出了明确的任务：要加强工作队、做好核算、提高劳动纪律。把原有六个不十分大的田间工作队改编为三队，此外，又成立了几个专业工作队——饲养工作队、园艺工作队、泥炭采掘工作队、机器修理工程队和四个牲畜饲养工作队。由富有经验、最有威信和正直的集体农庄庄员来领导这些工作队。党组织从所属的十七个党员和候补党员中指派十四人坚决地投入生产中。女共产党员安娜·娘赫担任田间工作队队长，上了年纪的而具有丰富经验的管理员谢尔格依·法侗担任饲养工作队队长。共青团员和其他最有能力和最有教养的男女青年，都担任了领导各工作组、领导统计员和挤奶妇的工作。
    康士坦丁·齐宾柯绝不让任何一个人对共同的事业漠不关心。他邀请一些上了年纪的人，征求他们对于提高土壤肥力和改造农场的计划底意见。
    他对老年人说：“如果我们能够在休耕地附近找到石灰石，我们就可以把它放到土壤中去，以减少土壤中所含的酸性。那时就可以种小麦，也可以种玉蜀黍了。”
    老年人热烈地响应齐宾柯的号召。他们在波格列布基附近、在德斯纳河沿岸发现了丰富的石灰石储藏地，这些石灰石对土壤的中和作用是有很大的帮助的。当时还没有碾磨机。最初老年人用锤子来把它砸碎，碾成粉末。现在，他们已经看到机器可以把石灰石碾磨得又碎又细。
    波格列布基村的情况开始逐渐好转起来了。土地的肥力一年一年地提高了。集体农庄把石灰石放到土壤中去，用羽扁豆当作绿肥，把它深深种在地下，并留一部分作为牲畜的饲料。每一公顷羽扁豆可以产生四百公担的绿肥，或是十八公担豆子，这些豆子碾成粉面后可做牲畜的良好饲料。羽扁豆收割后剩下来的残根，可以使土壤日渐肥沃。集体农庄一年一年地对土地施以更多的无机肥料和有机肥料。
      一九五○年秋季播种的第一批秋播小麦，一公顷收获了十七公担。一九五二年小麦播种面积已达二百二十五公顷，每公顷收获量达十八点四公担。现在这个集体农庄中的秋播小麦播种面积已达五百公顷，每一公顷可以收割二十至二十五公担谷物。
    大麻的收获量也大大地提高了。种植大麻的地段已一层层地施了很丰富的肥料。现在先进的集体农庄青年女庄员塔基扬娜·札莫尔斯卡娅和叶甫陀卡娅·奥斯拉奇大麻种植组每一公顷可以收割二十公担麻，而这个集体农庄的全部播种面积上，平均每一公顷可以收割十三至十五公担麻。种植大麻的地段并未扩大，可是这个集体农庄所收割的麻已比一九五○年增加了四倍。交给国营工厂的大麻纯薄而细长。为了提高产量，颁发了很多的奖金。大麻已成为农庄一种最高的收入了。去年因出售大麻而获得了三百万卢布，比一九五○年增加了二十四倍。
    康士坦丁·齐宾柯坚决而果敢地勉励全体集体农庄庄员为提高耕作技术而斗争。所有穗状作物完全采用交叉法，大麻用狭行距种植法，耕作农作物则用方形穴播法。播种一定要选择优良的品种。同时要采用植物人工授粉法。
    除了康士坦丁·齐宾柯外，现在在这个集体农庄中工作的，还有十一个专家。合共包括各专业艺师八人，动物饲养专家一人，兽医一人，助理兽医二人。
    最近几年来牲畜饲养场中的牛羊头数已经增加了一倍以上，它们的产物生产量也增长起来了。大约有一半的奶牛是列别金地方的纯种奶牛。挤奶妇叶甫陀基亚·科罗特琴柯、叶里札维塔·瓦西娜一年中所挤得的牛奶达三千公升。每年饲养的猪在三百头以上。在家禽饲养业方面一共养了三千多只鸡、鸭、鹅。养兔场也建立起来了。养蜂场的养房增加了一倍。养鱼的池塘已建筑起来，集体农庄庄员们养了很多蚕。在去年一年中因销售蚕茧而获得了十万卢布的收益。最近几年来，果木园的面积扩大了一倍。仅去年秋季所种植的苹果、梨、李子就达三十公顷以上。
    一九五一年集体农庄公有经济的收入为一百一十万卢布，一九五三年为五百一十万卢布，而到一九五四年，已增加到了八百万卢布。
    现在波格列布基的面貌已变得难以辨识了。所有的人都在为共同经营的事业积极地、辛勤地劳动着。
    集体农庄的庄员们逐月可以获得货币工资的预支。马厩管理员杰尼斯·莫依谢柯全家共有三口有劳动力的人，在去年年终分配时获得了三吨半谷物、半吨马铃薯、半吨蔬菜、饲料和一万七千三百卢布现金。伊万·谢尔斯丘克全家获得了三吨谷物，一万五千三百卢布现金和许多其他产品。此外，每一个以辛勤劳动超额完成计划的集体农庄庄员，还获得了额外的所得——挤奶妇得到了一千五到两千公升的牛奶，养猪员们获得了一百五十到二百公斤的猪肉及其他等等。现在，没有一个人再对共同劳动漠不关心了。去年一年中，每一个集体农庄庄员平均都完成了四百五十六个劳动日。
    农艺师康士坦丁·齐宾柯以共产党关于发展农业的决定武装了自己，并以自己的知识和创造性的劳动帮助波格列布基的集体农庄庄员们改造他们的大规模的经营。在过去几次苏联最高苏维埃改选运动中，集体农庄庄员们都推荐他们的领导人为代表候选人，并一致选举他为代表。
