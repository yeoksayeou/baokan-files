Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from London: British Foreign Secretary Eden made a report in the House of Commons on the 8th after returning home from the Bangkok Conference. Eden talked about the situation in the Taiwan region in his report.

In his report, Eden formally advocated that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique withdraw from the coastal islands of China. At the same time, Eden did not mention the fact that the United States was carrying out armed interference in China's internal affairs, but once again put forward the proposal of a so-called "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait. Eden said, "If these goals can be achieved, then the issue of China's representation in the United Nations and the future status of Taiwan can be considered internationally at an appropriate stage." The essence of Eden's proposal is to try to allow the United States and the Chiang bandits to legally obtain the right to occupy Taiwan for a long time by withdrawing from the coastal islands, thereby maintaining a military threat to China.

At the same time, Eden ignored the fact that the Chinese people actively supported the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference, and actually said, "Based on the information I have obtained from Beijing regarding the attitude of the Chinese government, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the necessary conditions for making progress do not yet exist." Eden's argument shows that he is trying to shift the responsibility for delaying the convening of the conference, and also reveals that he has not given up his intention to fight for a seat for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Eden publicly stated on the 7th that one of the necessary conditions for making the international conference "effective" was to "reach some agreement on the issue of the members of the conference."

Eden revealed that when he was in Bangkok, he had a "separate and beneficial discussion" with US Secretary of State Dulles on the situation in Taiwan and other coastal islands of China. In order to cover up the US war policy, Eden said, "The US government has provided affirmative evidence that they hope to ease tensions and reduce the danger of war." However, the fact is that after the Bangkok Conference, Dulles, US Chief of Naval Operations Carney, and other senior US generals conducted military deployments in Taiwan, and are now holding provocative joint US-Chiang naval and air force exercises in the Taiwan Strait, as well as the recent continuous bombardment of British merchant ships by Chiang bandit gunboats equipped by the United States. All of these further provide evidence that the United States is constantly creating tensions in the Taiwan region.

When talking about the Bangkok Conference, Eden described the Manila aggressive group as a way to strengthen "peace and stability" in Southeast Asia. However, he admitted that the main issue discussed at the Bangkok Conference was military arrangements. He also expressed his desire to expand the scope of the Manila Treaty, saying: "This conference has not done anything that would prevent other countries in the region from participating in the future."

    艾登参加曼谷会议返英后在下院谈台湾地区局势问题
    竟然想让美国长期霸占我国的领土台湾
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦消息：英国外交大臣艾登在参加曼谷会议回国后，八日在议会下院作了报告。艾登在报告中谈到了台湾地区局势问题。
    艾登在他的报告中正式主张蒋介石卖国集团撤出中国沿海岛屿。同时，艾登不提美国武装干涉中国内政的事实，却再次提出在台湾海峡实行所谓“停火”的主张。艾登说，“如果这些目的能够实现的话，那末就可以在适当的阶段由国际间来考虑中国在联合国的代表权问题和台湾的将来地位了。”艾登的建议的实质，就是要设法让美国和蒋贼用撤出沿海岛屿的办法，来合法地取得长期盘据台湾的权利，从而保持对中国的军事威胁。
    同时，艾登不顾中国人民积极支持苏联关于召开国际会议的建议这个事实，竟说，“根据我从北京得到的关于中国政府的态度的情报，我不得已得出了这个结论：取得进展的必要条件现在还不存在”。艾登这种论调，表明他企图转嫁拖延会议召开的责任，也暴露出他并没有放弃为蒋介石卖国集团争一个席位的打算。艾登在七日就曾公开表示，使国际会议“有成效”的必要条件之一是“就会议的成员问题达成某种协议”。
    艾登透露，当他在曼谷的时候，他曾经和美国国务卿杜勒斯进行了关于台湾和中国其他沿海岛屿的局势的“单独的、有益的讨论”。为了替美国的战争政策掩饰，艾登说，“美国政府已经提供了肯定的证据，证明他们希望缓和紧张局势并减少战争危险”。但是，事实是，曼谷会议以后，杜勒斯、美国海军作战部长卡涅和其他美国高级将领在台湾进行了军事部署，现在正在台湾海峡举行挑衅性的美蒋海空军联合演习，以及日前英国商船接连受到美国所装备的蒋贼军炮艇的轰击，这些都进一步提供了美国不断在台湾地区制造紧张局势的证据。
    艾登在谈到曼谷会议时，把马尼拉侵略集团说成是加强东南亚的“和平和稳定”的一个办法。但是，他承认，曼谷会议所讨论的主要问题却是军事安排。他还表示要扩大马尼拉条约的范围说：“这个会议也没有作出会阻止这个地区的其他国家在以后参加的任何事情。”
