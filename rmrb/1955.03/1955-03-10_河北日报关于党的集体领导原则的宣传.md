Hebei Daily's Propaganda on the Party's Principle of Collective Leadership
Bai Ru Yuan

Collective leadership is the highest principle of the Party's leadership. Whether in the past or present, our Party has always been the core force leading the people's revolutionary and construction undertakings, one of the fundamental reasons being that the Party has consistently adhered to the principle of collective leadership, consolidating the Party's unity on the basis of promoting democracy. The Party committees' newspapers at all levels should make the promotion of the Party's leadership role and leadership principles to Party members and the people their regular and important task; especially at the present time when we are striving to implement the Party's general line, strengthening the promotion of the Party's principle of collective leadership is even more important.

In this regard, the Hebei Daily's propaganda on the Party's principle of collective leadership and its achieved results are worthy of attention. From October 20th to December 31st of last year, the Hebei Daily set up a column in the newspaper entitled "Implement the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and Earnestly Strengthen the Collective Leadership of Party Organizations," and successively published 29 articles on this issue. These articles, in light of the actual situation of the implementation of collective leadership by Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province, provided a relatively systematic and accessible exposition of the Party's principle of collective leadership. In the past, the collective leadership system of Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province was very unsound. After studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, although Party organizations at all levels had made improvements in implementing collective leadership, many problems still existed. For example, some leading comrades of Party committees were still accustomed to making decisions on major issues individually, while some committee members responsible for departmental work had tendencies of decentralism and departmentalism; some Party committee meetings seemed to be more frequent than before, but due to the failure to fully promote democracy or other reasons, they did not truly play the role of collective leadership; and some Party committee members, for fear of making the mistake of decentralism, did not dare to independently and responsibly carry out their work, and submitted everything, no matter how trivial, to the Party committee for discussion. These situations show that many comrades' understanding of the principle of collective leadership is still incomplete and not profound. In order to better implement collective leadership, it is necessary to solve the problem of people's understanding. Starting from these situations, the Hebei Daily published articles such as "Collective Leadership is the Highest Principle of the Party's Leadership," "Correctly Implement Individual Responsibility under Collective Leadership," "Implementing Collective Leadership Must Struggle Against the Style of Individual Leadership," and "Criticism and Self-Criticism Should Be Earnestly Carried Out at Party Meetings." These articles elaborated on the great significance of implementing the principle of collective leadership for consolidating the Party's unity and improving the Party's leadership level, pointed out that implementing the principle of collective leadership is essentially a struggle between the working class's collectivist ideology and the bourgeoisie's individualist ideology, and specifically explained that collective leadership and individual responsibility should be correctly combined, that the Party committee secretary has a particularly important responsibility in implementing collective leadership, that Party committee members should actively participate in the collective leadership work of commanding the overall situation, that it is important to hold regular Party committee meetings and to earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism at Party meetings, and that the intra-Party life system stipulated in the Party Constitution is a guarantee for the realization of collective leadership, and so on.

In this batch of articles on collective leadership, the Hebei Daily not only expounded on this extremely important principle of intra-Party life from many aspects, but also, in light of the actual work of Party organizations and the ideological reality of Party members, exposed and criticized various phenomena that violated the principle of collective leadership. For example, in an article entitled "Collective Leadership is the Highest Principle of the Party's Leadership," it was revealed that Kai Yuan, the secretary of the Funing County Party Committee, and Tao Ke Ri and Chang Wenxuan, the deputy secretaries, decided without discussion by the Party Committee to issue instructions on such major issues as "Actively Develop Credit Cooperative Organizations with Active Actions" in their own names. While exposing these mistakes, the newspaper pointed out the harm of violating the Party's principle of collective leadership to the Party's cause. For example, the instructions on the development of credit cooperative organizations issued in the name of Kai Yuan, the secretary of the Funing County Party Committee, violated the Party's policy and erroneously put forward the requirement of "Adults, everyone joins the society." This specifically illustrates that individual decisions are often or almost always one-sided. Some Party organizations, Party committee secretaries, and Party committee members who were criticized by the newspaper made self-criticisms in the newspaper. Some of the articles published by the Hebei Daily were also in the nature of self-criticism. The authors of these articles were either secretaries of Party organizations or members of Party committees, and when discussing how to strengthen collective leadership, they all conducted open self-criticism of the shortcomings and mistakes in their work, as well as the ideological roots that produced these shortcomings and mistakes. Implementing the principle of collective leadership is not only a theoretical issue, but also a realistic ideological struggle. When expounding on the basic content of collective leadership, the Hebei Daily paid attention to combining theory with practice and carried out relatively full criticism and self-criticism of various thoughts and behaviors that violated the principle of collective leadership, which is very necessary for improving people's thinking and promoting practical work.

In this propaganda on collective leadership, the Hebei Daily also paid attention to introducing the good experiences of various places in implementing collective leadership. For example, the experience of the Cang County Party Committee in convening Party committee meetings, which was introduced in the newspaper, pointed out that in order to hold good Party committee meetings, it is necessary to correctly determine the content of Party committee meetings; to fully prepare before the meeting; to fully promote democracy at the meeting, to conduct discussions, and to make clear conclusions; and to correctly organize the implementation of the resolutions after the meeting; the experience of the Handan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in convening Party activists' meetings pointed out that fully promoting intra-Party democracy, paying attention to concentrating the wisdom of Party members and the masses, and absorbing the experience of Party members and the masses are important keys to strengthening the Party's collective leadership and doing a good job in the Party's work. The dissemination of these experiences can help Party organizations at all levels to better implement the principle of collective leadership.

Implementing the principle of collective leadership is a basic issue of Party building. This issue is of great concern to the leading members of Party organizations at all levels; and only by widely attracting them to participate in the discussion of this issue can the discussion be carried out fully and effectively. The Hebei Daily paid attention to this point. Of the 29 articles on collective leadership published in the newspaper, except for a few written by the editorial department itself, the vast majority were actively written by authors and activists from Party organizations at all levels, many of whom were secretaries of Party committees, including Party committee secretaries of prefectural committees, municipal committees, county committees, and factory Party committees. After determining the propaganda plan, the Hebei Daily Editorial Department made great efforts to organize articles, sent special personnel to the local areas to discuss writing issues with the authors, gave the authors concrete and practical assistance, and relied on the local Party committees to organize articles. This not only opened up the channels for the editorial department to obtain articles, but also made the content more substantial and specific because the articles written by the heads of Party organizations at all levels could often be related to the actual situation of the Party's life in the local area.

Because the Hebei Daily grasped such major principled issues as collective leadership in the propaganda of implementing the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and carried out systematic propaganda in light of reality, Party organizations and the vast number of Party member cadres in various places received a relatively profound education on the Party's principle of collective leadership, and directly promoted the work of Party organizations. For example, after the newspaper exposed the mistake of Kai Yuan, the secretary of the Funing County Party Committee, and others in issuing important instructions in their own names, Zhou Zhenhua, the secretary of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee, wrote an article entitled "Struggle Against the Mistake of Violating the Principle of Collective Leadership," in which, in addition to analyzing and criticizing the erroneous thinking of Kai Yuan and others, he also made a more systematic inspection of the problems existing in the Tangshan area Party organization in implementing collective leadership. The above-mentioned articles and other articles published in the newspaper had a great impact on Party organizations at all levels in the Tangshan area; the county Party committees of Changli, Fengrun, and Zunhua all inspected their own thoughts and behaviors that violated the principle of collective leadership based on the articles published in the newspaper, and put forward methods for improvement in the future. After reading the articles on the principle of collective leadership published in the newspaper, the Party committees of other regions also inspected their own thoughts and work in conjunction with these articles.

The achievements of the Hebei Daily's propaganda on the principle of collective leadership are affirmative, and the experience created is also very valuable, but there are still shortcomings. First of all, the depth of this propaganda is not enough. Regarding the elaboration of the principle of collective leadership, the newspaper made a relatively full discussion on the issue of improving the Party committee system. Improving the Party committee system is the basic system for implementing the Party's principle of collective leadership, and it is very necessary for the Hebei Daily to pay attention to the propaganda in this regard; however, in accordance with the spirit of the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses" as instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, further discussion should be made on mobilizing the vast number of Party members and the masses to actively participate in the Party's leadership work. In addition, the newspaper's connection with the current work in this propaganda is not enough. Except for a few articles that are closely linked to the current work, the content of general articles is not very closely linked to the current central work. If the Hebei Daily could pay attention to making these articles more closely linked to the current central work, and grasp the urgent issues in the current work to explain the principle of collective leadership, then the effect received and the help to practical work would be even greater.

Implementing collective leadership and opposing individual leadership is a struggle between the two different ideological systems of the working class's collectivism and the bourgeoisie's individualism, and between historical materialism and historical idealism. Implementing the principle of collective leadership in the Party's life and practical work is a long-term effort. The Hebei Daily should further deepen the propaganda in this area on the basis of this good start. The Party committees' newspapers at all levels should pay attention to the propaganda in this area, and continuously improve and enhance the propaganda in this area.

    河北日报关于党的集体领导原则的宣传
    白汝瑗
    集体领导是党的领导的最高原则。我们的党不论在过去或现在，一直成为领导人民革命事业和建设事业的核心力量，根本原因之一，就是因为党一贯地坚持了集体领导的原则，在发扬民主的基础上巩固了党的团结和统一。各级党委机关报应当把向党员向人民群众宣传党的领导作用和党的领导原则，做为自己的经常的重要任务；特别在我们为贯彻党的总路线而奋斗的目前时期，加强党的集体领导原则的宣传，就显得更加重要。
    在这方面，河北日报所进行的关于党的集体领导原则的宣传及其所获得的成效，是值得重视的。河北日报从去年十月二十日到十二月三十一日，在报上设立“贯彻党的四中全会决议，认真加强党组织的集体领导”的专栏，陆续地发表了二十九篇有关这一问题的文章。这些文章针对河北省各级党组织贯彻集体领导的实际状况，对党的集体领导的原则做了比较系统而通俗的阐述。过去，河北省各级党组织的集体领导制度是很不健全的。经过对党的七届四中全会决议的学习，各级党组织在贯彻集体领导方面虽然有了改进，但是也还存在着许多问题。例如有的党委负责同志依然习惯于个人决定重大问题，有的负责部门工作的委员则有着分散主义和本位主义的倾向；有的党委会议看起来是比以前经常了，但是由于没有充分发扬民主或其他原因，并没有真正发挥集体领导的作用；也有一些党委委员因为怕犯分散主义的错误而不敢独立负责地进行工作，事无大小都提交党委会讨论。这些情况说明了许多同志对于集体领导原则的认识还是不完整不深刻的。为了更好地贯彻集体领导，就必须解决人们的认识问题。河北日报从这些情况出发，发表了“集体领导是党的领导的最高原则”、“正确实行集体领导下的个人负责制”、“贯彻集体领导必须向个人领导的作风进行斗争”、“在党的会议上应认真开展批评与自我批评”等文章。这些文章阐述了贯彻集体领导原则对于巩固党的团结和提高党的领导水平的重大意义，指出了贯彻集体领导原则实质上就是工人阶级集体主义思想同资产阶级个人主义思想的斗争，同时具体地说明了集体领导和个人负责应当正确结合，说明了党委书记在贯彻集体领导中负有特别重大的责任，党委委员则应当积极参与指挥全局的集体领导工作，说明了定期开好党的委员会议和在党的会议上认真开展批评和自我批评的重要，说明了党章所规定的党内生活制度是实现集体领导的保证，等等。
    河北日报在这一批有关集体领导的文章中，不只是从多方面阐明了党内生活的这一极其重要的原则，而且结合党组织的工作实际和党员的思想实际，对各种违背集体领导原则的现象进行了揭露和批判。例如，在一篇题为“集体领导是党的领导的最高原则”的文章中，就揭露了抚宁县委书记开源、副书记陶克日和常文选不经党委会的讨论决定，擅自用个人名义发出“以积极行动大力发展信用合作组织”这样有关重大问题的指示的错误。报纸在揭露这些错误的同时，指出了违背党的集体领导原则对于党的事业的危害性。像抚宁县委书记开源等以个人名义发出的关于发展信用合作组织的指示就违背了党的政策，错误地提出了“成年人，人人入社”的要求。这就具体地说明了，个人的决定常常是或者差不多常常是片面的。受到报纸批评的某些党组织、党委书记和党委委员都在报上做了检讨。河北日报所发表的这批文章中，还有一部分是属于自我批评性质的。这些文章的作者或者是党组织的书记，或者是党委委员，他们在讨论如何加强集体领导的问题时，都对自己工作中的缺点和错误，以及产生这些缺点和错误的思想根源，进行了公开的自我批评。贯彻集体领导原则不只是一个理论问题，而且是一种现实的思想斗争。河北日报在阐述集体领导的基本内容时，注意结合实际，对各种违背集体领导原则的思想和行为比较充分地开展了批评和自我批评，这无论对于提高人们的思想和推动实际工作都是很有必要的。
    河北日报在这次关于集体领导的宣传中，还注意了介绍各地贯彻集体领导的较好的经验。例如，报上介绍的沧县地委召开的党委会议的经验，就指明了要开好党委会议，必须正确地确定党委会议的内容；会前要充分做好准备工作；会上要充分发扬民主，展开讨论，并做出明确的结论；会后要正确地组织决议的执行；邯郸第一棉纺织厂召开党的活动分子会议的经验，则指明了充分发扬党内民主，注意集中党员群众的智慧和吸取党员群众的经验，是加强党的集体领导、做好党的工作的重要关键。这些经验的传播，能够帮助各级党组织更好地贯彻集体领导原则。
    贯彻集体领导原则是党的建设的一个基本问题。这个问题是各级党组织的领导成员所极其关心的；也只有广泛吸引他们来参加对这个问题的讨论，才能使这个讨论进行得充分而有效。河北日报注意到这一点。在报纸上发表的有关集体领导的二十九篇稿件中，除少数是编辑部自己写的外，绝大部分都是各级党组织的作者积极分子写的，其中很多又是党委会的书记，包括地委、市委、县委以及工厂党委书记写的。河北日报编辑部在确定宣传计划后，曾以大力进行组织稿件的工作，派出专人到地方上去和作者商量写稿问题，给作者以具体切实的帮助，并依靠地方党委来组织稿件。这就不仅使编辑部打开了稿源的门路，而且由各级党组织的负责人执笔所写的稿件多能联系当地党的生活的实际，因而使内容也更加充实、具体。
    由于河北日报在贯彻四中全会决议的宣传中，抓住了像集体领导这样重大原则性的问题，结合实际地进行了系统的宣传，这就使得各地党组织和广大的党员干部受到了一次比较深刻的关于党的集体领导原则的教育，并直接推动了党组织的工作。例如，报纸揭发了抚宁县委书记开源等以个人名义发布重要指示的错误后，唐山地委书记周振华就写了一篇“向违反集体领导原则的错误作斗争”的文章，文中除分析批判了开源等人的错误思想外，并对唐山地区党组织在贯彻集体领导方面所存在的问题做了比较系统的检查。上述文章以及报纸发表的其他文章，在唐山地区各级党组织中产生了很大的影响；昌黎、丰润、遵化等县委都根据报上发表的文章，对自己违反集体领导原则的思想和行为做了检查，并提出了今后改进的办法。其他一些地区的党委，在读了报上发表的有关集体领导原则的文章后，也都结合这些文章检查了自己的思想和工作。
    河北日报关于集体领导原则的宣传所获得的成效是肯定的，所创造的经验也是很可贵的，但是仍有不足的地方。首先是这个宣传的深度还不够。关于集体领导原则的阐明，报纸对健全党委制的问题，做了比较充分的论述，健全党委制是贯彻党的集体领导原则的基本制度，河北日报注意了这一方面的宣传是十分必要的；但是，还应按照毛泽东同志所指示的从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法的精神，对发动广大党员群众积极参加党的领导工作做进一步的论述。另外，报纸在这一宣传中结合当前工作还嫌不够。这些稿件除了有几篇结合当前工作比较紧密外，一般的稿件内容和当前的中心工作结合的还不是十分紧密的。河北日报如果能够注意使这些稿件更密切地结合当前中心工作，抓住当前工作中的紧迫问题来阐明集体领导的原则，那么收到的效果和对实际工作的帮助就会更大。
    贯彻集体领导和反对个人领导，是工人阶级的集体主义和资产阶级的个人主义、是历史唯物主义和历史唯心主义的两种不同的思想体系的斗争。在党的生活中和实际工作中贯彻集体领导原则，是一个长期的努力过程。河北日报应当在这个良好开端的基础之上进一步深入这方面宣传。各级党委机关报都应当重视这方面的宣传，并不断地改进和提高这方面的宣传。
