Southwest Steel Company Employees Collect Scrap Steel

The Southwest Steel Company's campaign to excavate and collect scrap steel has yielded positive results, with over 200 tons of scrap steel already excavated.

In the past, the Southwest Steel Company had serious waste issues. Since the launch of a mass anti-waste campaign in December 1954, and the holding of an anti-waste struggle exhibition in January 1955, many employees have made suggestions to leaders at all levels on how to overcome waste. Jiang Liming, a worker in the steel bar yard, wrote a letter to the Party committee on January 16, suggesting a mass campaign to excavate and collect scrap steel throughout the entire factory. The Party committee adopted his suggestion, calling on all employees to enthusiastically participate in this campaign, and instructed all branches to rely on the masses to continue to deepen the anti-waste struggle. On February 5, the factory administration issued a notice to launch the excavation and collection of scrap steel, stipulating methods for excavation and collection. The factory trade union also mobilized all employees to respond to the Party committee's call and actively participate in the excavation and collection of scrap steel. Various workshops subsequently organized "Scrap Steel Excavation Assault Teams" and "Scrap Steel Excavation and Savings Groups" based on workshops, teams, and groups. Some workshops, teams, and groups also launched challenges and responses, using Sundays and spare time to excavate and collect scrap steel. On February 7, all employees of the equipment repair section excavated more than 20 tons of scrap steel near the workshop in more than four hours. The steel rail yard also excavated and collected more than 50 tons of scrap steel in more than ten days. As of February 26, the entire factory had excavated a total of more than 286 tons of scrap steel, of which 142 tons had been delivered to the warehouse for production. Currently, employees in some workshops are continuing to excavate and collect scrap steel.

    西南钢铁公司职工搜集废钢铁
    西南钢铁公司展开挖掘和搜集废钢铁运动取得成效，已挖掘出废钢铁二百多吨。
    西南钢铁公司以往浪费现象很严重。自一九五四年十二月开展了群众性的反浪费斗争和一九五五年一月举办了反浪费斗争展览会以后，许多职工都向各级领导提出了克服浪费的办法。钢条场工人江礼明在一月十六日给党委写信，建议在全厂范围内展开群众性的挖掘和搜集废钢铁运动。党委采纳了他的建议，号召全体职工热烈参加这一运动，并责成各支部依靠群众，把反浪费斗争继续深入下去。二月五日，厂行政发出了展开挖掘和搜集废钢铁工作的通知，订出了挖掘和搜集废钢铁办法。厂工会也发动全体职工，响应党委号召，积极参加挖掘和搜集废钢铁运动。各车间即先后组织了以车间、班、组为单位的“挖掘废钢铁突击队”和“挖掘废钢铁节约小组”，部分车间、班、组还展开了挑战应战，利用星期日和工余时间挖掘和搜集废钢铁。二月七日，设备检修段全体职工在四个多小时内便在车间附近挖掘了废钢铁二十多吨。钢轨场在十多天内也挖掘和搜集了废钢铁五十多吨。到二月二十六日止，全厂共挖掘出废钢铁二百八十六吨多，其中有一百四十二吨已交库投入生产。现在，还有部分车间的职工正继续挖掘和搜集废钢铁。
