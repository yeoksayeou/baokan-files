Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: According to a report by the United Press, American spy Meng Yi, who was expelled from the People's Republic of China, arrived in New York on the 23rd, accompanied by an American Army intelligence officer. At the New York airport, Meng Yi admitted to the crime of American espionage against China to news reporters.

Meng Yi said: In July 1945, he worked for the US government's Strategic Intelligence Agency in China. This was the beginning of his detective activities against peace and democratic forces in various places. He did some secret work for an American spy—personnel from the American spy organization and the Central Intelligence Agency. Meng Yi said that in 1951, he supplied information about the Chinese People's Volunteers to American spy agencies. He said: Because of his crimes, he was arrested, pleaded guilty, and confessed.

An American reporter interrupted and asked Meng Yi if his confession was obtained through torture. Meng Yi emphatically replied, "No, such practices are forbidden in the People's Republic of China."

Meng Yi said: "I want to tell the truth. The American public has been deceived by lies for long enough."

Meng Yi's family members, who came to the airport to greet him, were afraid that Meng Yi would be persecuted by the American authorities. Meng Yi's mother repeatedly asked Meng Yi to stop talking. She said worriedly, "You're not considering us."

    被我驱逐的美国间谍孟义回到纽约
    承认美国对我国进行间谍活动
    【新华社二十五日讯】据合众社报道，被中华人民共和国政府驱逐出境的美国间谍孟义，二十三日在一个美国陆军情报军官跟随下到达纽约。孟义在纽约机场上对新闻记者承认美国对中国进行间谍活动的罪行。
    孟义说：在一九四五年七月，他在中国为美国政府战略情报局工作。这就是对各地和平和民主力量进行侦探活动的开始。他为一个美国间谍——美国间谍组织和中央情报局的人员——做了一些秘密工作。孟义说，他在一九五一年把关于中国人民志愿军的情报供给美国间谍机构。他说：由于他的罪行，他被捕了，他服了罪而且承认了。
    一个美国记者插进来问孟义，他的招供是不是受拷打逼出来的。孟义着重地回答说：“不是的，这种做法在中华人民共和国是禁止的。”
    孟义说：“我要说真话。美国公众被谎言蒙蔽的时间已够长了。”
    到机场迎接的孟义的家属害怕孟义要受美国当局的迫害，孟义的母亲连连要孟义不再讲下去，她担心地说：“你不顾及我们。”
