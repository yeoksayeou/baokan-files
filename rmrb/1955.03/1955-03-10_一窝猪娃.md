Just as early winter arrived, before the elm, willow, and locust trees had shed their leaves, a sudden heavy snow fell. Snowflakes landed on the thick, leafy branches, gradually piling up, bending the branches of the large trees and the trunks of the small ones. Eventually, many branches and trunks, as thick as teacups, could no longer bear the weight of the snow and snapped one after another with cracking sounds.

Perhaps some people might doubt: Does such a strange phenomenon truly exist in nature? But this was the scene in the plains below the Zhongnan Mountains in the winter of 1954. Seeing trees toppled and branches broken along the roads and in the villages, people, while saying that the coming year's wheat harvest was assured, still felt a sense of regret in their hearts. But before this snow could melt, continuous blizzards for three days and two nights brought several more snowfalls. This plain, which even in the depths of winter was usually covered with green wheat seedlings, was now completely covered by a thick blanket of snow. For several days, the blizzards cut off transportation and sealed off the villages. People casually threw out brooms used to sweep the heated brick beds, chasing after wild rabbits that had sneaked into the courtyards in search of food.

People living outside Shanhaiguan Pass and on the Inner Mongolian grasslands are used to such winters. They have all kinds of fur coats, felt boots, and felt shoes. Moreover, they either go into the mountains to cut firewood after the autumn harvest or use cow dung cakes that have been dried long ago to light braziers. But the people living by the Hao River, where a thin layer of ice had never even formed, were unexpectedly suffering from this sudden cold in simple straw sheds that could only keep out the wind and rain, completely unprepared. The faces and hands of many women and children were frostbitten; old men and women sat behind the stove, covering their legs and feet with quilts, afraid to get off the heated brick beds all day long; cattle trembled in the sheds, and many weak old cattle collapsed. ...

One evening, after attending a meeting of the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Third Village, Huangfu, I was walking home on the snow-covered road on the north bank of the Hao River when I suddenly heard someone calling and chasing after me from behind. I turned around and saw Wang Jiabin, the director of the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fourth Village, running towards me, his nose and mouth puffing out three streams of white vapor. When he reached me, he wiped the steaming sweat from his flushed forehead with his sleeve and said:

"What should I do? The county called the district and asked me to go early tomorrow morning to give a report to the training class for the backbone cadres of the Communist Youth League who are establishing cooperatives; but the cooperative really can't do without me. Could you call the county and say I can't go? ..."

I thought something had happened at the Shengli Cooperative, but after hearing his words, although he looked very anxious, I was relieved. I had heard Jiabin mention that the county Communist Youth League committee had asked him to give a report to the training class, and I had also heard him worry that the circle of activities outside the cooperative was getting bigger and bigger, increasing his burden; but what could be done? On the road to socialism, those who walk in front should tell everyone how they are walking, especially in the countryside. ...

I asked him, "Why can't you get away?"

He said, "The sow that the cooperative is raising is about to give birth to piglets in the next few days. With such harsh weather, if things don't go well, not a single piglet will survive; they'll all freeze to death." He turned his eyes to the snow-covered plain that stretched as far as the eye could see and sighed, "Ah! Why does it have to be so coincidental? This litter of piglets is really giving me a hard time..."

My eyes, exposed above the mask, stared at his uneasy expression, and I couldn't help but laugh. Indeed, when a person is so focused on a certain undertaking that they are completely absorbed in it, their words and actions can sometimes be amusing. After the autumn harvest, Jiabin had told me about the Shengli Cooperative raising sows and having piglets countless times, often interrupting other conversations to talk about it. Two new members had sows, and he persuaded them to invest their sows in the cooperative; but after persuading one, the other refused to do so no matter what. According to Jiabin's plan: the cooperative's tofu workshop should raise two sows, and the members could catch the piglets and raise them without spending any money; when the piglets grew up, the cooperative could raise the strong pigs in large pens without spending any money when the members couldn't afford to raise them anymore; and when the cooperative sold the fat pigs, it would pay the members for the strong pigs, and the members would pay the cooperative for the piglets. He said that in this way, one litter after another, the sound of pigs grunting could always be heard in the pigsties of the cooperative and the members, the members would always have pocket money to buy oil and salt, and the cooperative would unconsciously accumulate many piles of pig manure. ...

Now, I smiled and explained to him that his plan was good, but since the cooperative had grown larger, as the director, he should change his way of doing things from when he ran a small cooperative; it wouldn't work if he still wanted to handle everything himself to be sure. I told him to arrange the work well and give the responsibility to specific people.

"Think about it, just because the cooperative's sow is about to give birth to piglets, you can't give a report to the backbone members of the Communist Youth League in the whole county; does that make sense?"

Jiabin listened and smiled embarrassedly. But he still stared blankly at the white plain, sighing, pursing his lips, and scratching the back of his ear with a large, rough hand, looking troubled!

He reached out his rough fingers and calculated for me: three people from the cooperative were studying at the county's accounting training class and the Communist Youth League member training class; two tofu grinding machines took up six people, and making twenty pieces of tofu a day required ten people to carry them to town to sell; originally, only one person was needed to follow the rubber-wheeled cart, but now the road was bad and difficult to move, so two people were needed; six people were carrying manure to the army barracks, which was agreed upon in rotation with other agricultural cooperatives, and it would be a loss to send fewer people; in addition, there were two stables and one pen of strong pigs, and special personnel were assigned to carry soil and build pens to protect the livestock safely through the winter.

"Right now, I'm the only one who is flexible," he said finally, looking worried. "I said at the cooperative affairs meeting that I would be responsible for the sow giving birth to piglets because the timing is uncertain. It's not that I don't trust others..."

"Can't you find someone from among the dozens of cooperative members who can take care of the sow giving birth to piglets for one day?"

He said thoughtfully, "If I want to find someone, I can find someone; it's just that we haven't figured out a good way to keep the piglets alive. If I just leave for the county, my heart will still be in the cooperative, how can I give a good report to others? ..."

He told me worriedly that they had researched many methods, but none of them worked. For example, if they herded the sow into a straw shed to give birth, people would wake up cold in the middle of the night even when they were burning a heated brick bed and covered with quilts, how could the piglets stand it? For example, if they burned firewood to keep the piglets warm, how much firewood would they burn throughout the winter, and how much would this litter of piglets cost?

His worries aroused my sympathy. Staring at his anxious expression, I no longer found him amusing.

I said, "In this kind of weather, if something were to happen..."

"I wouldn't dare!" Jiabin said firmly, "A litter of piglets is a small matter, but what you said, the political significance is great. People will say: 'The Shengli Cooperative is good! Not a single piglet from the Shengli Cooperative survived!'"

As he spoke, he tilted his head towards the cliff on the plateau on the north bank of the Hao River, indicating that this was something he absolutely could not let happen. I knew his character of never yielding to any difficulty; I also knew his determination to keep this first agricultural cooperative always at the forefront of the entire district's advance towards socialism. What was particularly interesting was that since I had said during the autumn summary that the increase or decrease in the cooperative's crops and the prosperity or death of livestock all had political significance, he often started meetings, criticized people, talked to people, and discussed matters with the phrase "political significance," which often brought about well-intentioned laughter.

I saw him staring at the cliff on the plateau in thought, and I also felt troubled. But after a while, I saw his eyebrows suddenly relax, a smile appeared on his face, and his eyes gleamed.

"I have a solution," he said happily, "No need to make a phone call, I'll go to the county early tomorrow morning!"

"What solution?"

"You'll know in a few days when the piglets are alive. It's too cold, you should go home quickly," he said, and hurriedly walked away, stepping on the creaking snow.

A few days later, in Third Village, I heard people everywhere talking about a joke. Wang Jiabin herded the Shengli Cooperative's sow from the rice fields on the south bank of the Hao River to the foot of the plateau cliff on the north bank, and it gave birth to piglets in one of Zhao Laoer's cave dwellings that was warm in winter and cool in summer. Because he didn't expect it to give birth that night, he didn't assign anyone to live in that cave dwelling, which resulted in thirteen piglets being born, two of which were crushed to death by their foolish mother, leaving eleven alive. And Lei Enrang, the member who had refused to invest his sow in the cooperative after being persuaded many times, his sow gave birth to piglets during the day, fourteen of them. Lei Enrang roasted fire for the newly born, wet piglets, and his wife carried rice straw in large baskets. The couple were busy all day and hungry all day. When they stopped roasting fire at night, the fourteen piglets died one after another, stiff as rocks...

People not only talked about this litter of piglets from the Shengli Cooperative, but also talked about the mighty momentum of the ten people from the Shengli Cooperative going to sell tofu every morning in the vast expanse of snow, and the six people going to dig manure; they talked about how the livestock in the Shengli Cooperative not only didn't lose weight in the severe cold, but actually gained weight because they were drinking tofu wastewater; they talked about how when the district supply and marketing cooperative couldn't find rubber-wheeled carts because the road was too bad, the Shengli Cooperative's rubber-wheeled cart harnessed four mules, and three people drove the cart to pull goods for the supply and marketing cooperative, ensuring that the supply of daily necessities to the people was not interrupted. ...

"Look how energetic the people from the Shengli Cooperative are when they walk!"

"How many people have frostbitten hands and still sell tofu without digging manure!"

"Ah! Don't mention those things. It's so dangerous to drive a cart in the heavy wind and snow!"

These exclamations gave people a clear impression: in the Shengli Cooperative, labor was indeed no longer a heavy burden, but a glorious, heroic, and valiant undertaking. I didn't expect that after only one year of successful production and distribution, there would be such a big change in the members' attitude towards labor; I didn't expect that the young Wang Jiabin, after only one year as the director of the cooperative, could manage an expanded agricultural cooperative so well-organized and full of vitality. When expanding the cooperative before the autumn harvest, I was worried that he lacked ideas, didn't think carefully, and lacked courage, and that he wouldn't be able to manage it well if the cooperative became too large; but now, many facts have proven that he has learned a little bit about leadership. --In every period, he would seize the most important or most difficult things and take them on himself!

People praised that when the new stables of the Shengli Cooperative had just combined the livestock, Jiabin slept in that stable for many nights, specifically teaching the feeders who had never fed livestock in large pens what to pay attention to. When the Shengli Cooperative's tofu workshop lost money at the beginning, he spent all day in the tofu workshop, studying with the people in charge of sideline occupations, improving the output and quality of tofu, so that buyers lined up in front of the Shengli Cooperative's tofu stall in town. Later, he presided over the sale of surplus grain, repaid the loans, and signed a production and sales contract for spring sideline occupations with the supply and marketing cooperative, and he devoted all his mind and body to buying rubber-wheeled carts. He bought two rubber wheels from Xi'an, and the bus could only take him to a place ten miles away from the village, so he carried the two wheel bags back himself. After crossing the Shenhe Plateau, the sweat soaked through his cotton clothes, and when he reached the north bank of the Hao River, he couldn't carry them any further. He left the wheel bags at the township government, and someone kindly asked him to go back and send someone to pick them up, but he rested for a while, looked around for a while, and still carried one back. The rubber-wheeled cart left the village amidst the snow and the villagers' well-wishing eyes, and his attention was focused on the sow's swollen belly again. ...

However, can you say that this is just a matter of working methods? No! This is mainly the spirit of a Communist Party member--the leader of farmers going to socialism, wholeheartedly doing things for everyone!

One day, I took some time to cross the south bank of the Hao River to Wang Jiabin's home. His mother and wife were sitting on the heated brick bed in the straw shed, covering their legs and feet with quilts, watching over his sick five-year-old daughter, Caicai. This girl was having measles during this cold season, with a high fever, and was shouting "Papa! Papa!" day and night. When I pushed the door open, little Caicai thought her father had returned, and shouted and got up. When she realized it wasn't her father, tears rolled down one after another from her red apple-like little face, and her little lips twitched as she cried.

Jiabin's mother sighed and told me that he had not only not been home during the day, but had also not returned at night for days.

Jiabin's wife, Li Fengying, said with a wry smile: "I've been in this house for so many years, and the director has never been able to run around as much as he has this winter. You hear that he's there, and when you get there, he's already gone somewhere else."

The next day, as it got dark, I happened to meet Jiabin at the Guo Family intersection in Huangfu Village. He was waiting there for the rubber-wheeled cart to return. When he opened his mouth, I was shocked. His voice was so hoarse that it sounded like an old cat meowing, as if something was blocking his throat.

"What happened to you?"

"Coughing," he said hoarsely.

"How could you cough so badly?"

"The place where I stay at night isn't right."

"Where are you staying?"

He told me that he was staying in a mill shed belonging to a family at the Guo Family intersection. He was feeding the mules that pulled the rubber-wheeled cart there all night. He explained that this was to allow the carters, who had been frozen all day, to go home and sleep on a heated brick bed and to be ready to leave early the next morning; on the other hand, he had to cross the river early and late to feed the cooperative's sow, so he simply stayed on this side of the river. He said that coughing so badly was not entirely because of the cold, and that the smoke from burning a small pile of rice husks for warmth also had a big impact. ...

"Are you going to see our piglets?" he asked me with victorious pride. "Look, let's go! As soon as people go in, they run around with a whoosh, they're so close to people!"

The way he said it, he had such deep feelings for the piglets! Didn't he know that his little Caicai was suffering in the high fever of measles?

In fact, my concern for Jiabin was greater than my concern for the piglets. I asked him:

"When your rubber-wheeled cart returns, why don't you send the mules to the cooperative's stables to be fed?"

"Crossing the river twice in the morning and evening causes ice to form on the mules' legs, they can't stand it!"

"Let's go! Let's see where you live."

We arrived at the mill shed where he lived. There were no windows, and there was only a large ventilation hole in the earthen wall. There was no door, only a piece of straw curtain hanging. On one side was a large pile of animal manure covered with dry soil, and on the other side was a small pile of ashes from burning rice husks. In this corner, some rice straw was laid, and a broken cotton robe was thrown on top, which was his lodging. I looked up and saw that the straw shed was covered with long and short strands of dust. ...

"Comrade," I said very dissatisfied, "You're going too far, aren't you? Isn't there any other way to solve this problem? You have to take care of the livestock, but you also have to take care of people!"

Jiabin smiled without complaint and said in a hoarse voice: "The winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China wasn't as cold as this winter, but it was similar. At that time, I was nine years old and begged for food with my mother. At first, we slept in the doorways of people's houses, but we couldn't stand the cold; later, we slept in temples, but it was still too cold. We crawled into kilns where people were burning bricks and tiles, and it wasn't cold anymore; but the kiln owner chased us away, and my mother and I cried in the snow..."

Seeing tears welling up in my eyes, he stopped talking. I admit that my emotions are too fragile and cannot withstand such touching things. I, this intellectual, have spent a year with Jiabin and have learned too little from him; he is so heroic, speaking of his tragic childhood as if he were speaking of someone else's affairs!

We are the first generation in our country to build socialism. History has bestowed such great happiness upon us, allowing us to see countless large buildings rising from the ground with our own eyes; how the highway to Lhasa was built over the roof of the world, how the railway to the Ili River was built over the Wushao Ridge, and how the railway to Mongolia was built over the grasslands without water, we know from the newspapers rather than from history books. And right before our eyes, hundreds of millions of farmers, with all kinds of complex emotions, have bid farewell to thousands of years of lifestyle forever, cautiously throwing themselves into the new historical torrent, exploring the mysteries of a new life! When we think of every achievement in our country's socialist construction, even the accumulation of such a small amount of socialist family property as a litter of piglets in an agricultural cooperative, how difficult it is, can we not feel love from our hearts for those who work hard for socialism?

Huangfu Village, February 5, 1955.

    一窝猪娃
    柳青
    刚到初冬，榆树、柳树、槐树都还没落叶，陡然间下了场大雪。雪花一片一片落在枝稠叶密的树上，渐渐成了堆，压弯了大树的树枝和小树的树身。最后，许多茶碗粗细的树枝和树身，竟也负担不起雪堆的重压，终于接二连三咯喳咯喳折断了。
    也许有人怀疑：自然界真有这样的怪现象吗？但这是一九五四年冬天终南山下平原上的景象。在路上和村里看见树木东倒西歪，折枝断干，虽然人们嘴里都说来年的小麦丰收有了把握，心里却总觉着有些惋惜。可是这场雪还没化了，连续三天两日的大风雪，又来了几场。这先前虽在数九天也是遍地麦苗绿的平原，现在整个都被很厚的积雪覆盖得严严实实了。有几天，大风雪断绝了交通，封锁了村庄，有人顺手抛出扫炕的笤帚，追打溜进院里来觅食的野兔。
    住在山海关外和内蒙草原的人们，是过惯这样的冬天的。他们有各种皮衣、毡靴、?鞡鞋；而且，他们不是收完秋就进山砍劈柴，便是会用早就晒干的牛粪块打火盆。但是住在从来不曾结过一层薄冰的镐河边的人们，却是在只能蔽风雨的稻草棚棚里，毫无准备地遭受着这严寒的突然袭击。多少女人们和孩子们的脸和手给冻坏了；老头们和老婆们拿被窝盖着腿脚坐在灶壁后面，整天怕下炕；牛在牛棚里哆嗦着，多少瘦弱的老牛倒下去了。……
    一天黄昏，我在皇甫村三村参加罢光明农业生产合作社的会，踏着镐河北岸大路上的积雪回家，忽听得背后有人喊叫着追赶我。我转过身，见是四村的胜利农业生产合作社的主任王家斌，鼻子和口喷着三股白汽朝我跑来。到我跟前，他用袖口揩着红腾腾的额颅上冒汽的汗水，说：
    “怎办呢？县上给区上打来电话，叫我明儿一早去，给青年团的建社骨干训练班做报告；可是社里实在走不脱。你能不能给县上打个电话，说我去不成？……”
    我还以为胜利社也出了什么事，听了他的话，虽然他的样子很着急，我却释然放心了。我听家斌说过青年团县委约他给训练班做报告的事，也听他熬煎过社外活动的圈子越来越大，加重了他的负担；但是这又有什么办法呢？在通往社会主义的路上，走在前边的人是理应向大伙讲讲他们是怎样走的，特别是在农村。……
    我问他：“你怎么走不脱？”
    他说：“社里喂的那个母猪，就在这两天下猪娃。你看天气这么硬，弄不好，猪娃是连一个也捞不住，都得冻死。”他转眼望着一眼看不到边的雪盖的平原，叹了口气：“唉！碰这么巧？这窝猪娃可把我整住了………”
    我口罩上面露着两只眼，盯着他不安的神情，忍不住笑。的确，一个人对某种事业专心到入迷的程度，他的说话和行动有时真能逗人笑。秋后，关于胜利社喂母猪下猪娃的事，家斌给我津津有味地说过无数遍，常常在和我谈着别的话时，也岔到这件事上去。新社员里有两户喂着母猪，他说服他们都把母猪投资到社里；可是一户说服了，另一户说什么也不干。按家斌的计划：社里的豆腐房要喂两个母猪，社员们不掏现钱就可以逮猪娃喂；猪娃大了，社员们喂不起了的时候，社里就可以不掏现钱喂大槽的壮猪；等到社里卖了肥猪，给社员们交壮猪钱，社员们给社里交猪娃钱。他说，这样一窝接着一窝，社里和社员们的猪圈里常听见猪哼哼的声音，社员们手头常有买油盐的零钱用，社里的猪粪也在不知不觉中积起了好多堆。………
    现在，我笑着给他解释：他的计划好是好，可是社大了，他当这主任，该改变一下过去办小社时的作法了；还像过去那样大小事都由自己经手才放心，不行了。我要他把活安排好，把责任交给一定的人。
    “你想想，就为社里的母猪要下猪娃，你就不能给全县的青年团的骨干分子去报告，这像个话吗？”
    家斌听了，也不好意思地笑了。但他随即还是呆望着白皑皑的平原，叹着气，咂着嘴，一只粗大的手掌摸着耳朵后面的?项，作着难！
    他伸手用粗糙的指头给我计算着：社里有三个人在县里办的会计训练班和青年团员训练班学习；两台豆腐磨子占去了六个人，一天做二十个豆腐，要十个人挑到镇上去卖；赶胶轮车的原来只要一个人跟车，现在路不好行动，得两个人；六个人到军队的营房里去担大粪，这是和其他农业社议定轮流的，少去人要吃亏；另外，还有两处马房和一槽壮猪，为了保护牲畜安全过冬，担土、起圈，都配了专人。
    “眼下还只我是个活便人，”他最后愁楚地说：“我在社务会议上说了，这母猪下猪娃的事靠不住时辰，由我负责。并不是我不放心旁人……”
      “难道你从几十户社员里就找不出一个人来，能替你照看一天母猪下猪娃的事吗？”
    他沉思地说：“要找，也能找下；只是，至而今我们还没捉摸出个好办法，怎着才能把猪娃下活。我就这么掼下到县里去，心还在社里，怎能给人家报告好呢？……”
    他愁楚地告诉我，他们研究了许多办法，都不行。譬如说，把母猪吆到稻草棚棚里下吧，人烧着热炕、盖着被窝，夜里还冻醒来，猪娃怎能受得了呢？譬如说，烧柴禾给猪娃烤火吧，这整个冬天要烧多少柴禾，这窝猪娃要多大成本呢？
    他的忧愁引起了我的同情。我盯着他焦灼的神情，再也不觉得他好笑了。
    我说：“这样的天气，万一……”
      “不敢！”家斌坚决地说：“一窝猪娃事小，你说的，政治意义大。人家会说：‘胜利社好！胜利社的猪娃，一个也没活了！’……”
    他说着，朝着镐河北岸高原的崖壁歪着头，表示这是他绝不能让它发生的事情。他对任何困难都不屈服的性格，我是知道的；我也知道他决心把这第一个农业社永远保持在全区向社会主义前进的最前头。特别有趣的是：自从秋后总结时我说过农业社的庄稼增产或减产、牲畜兴旺或死亡，都是有政治意义的话以后，他开会讲话、批评人、和人谈话、商量事，开口闭口“政治意义”，常引起人们善意的笑。
    我看他盯着高原的崖壁沉思，也作起难来。可是，过了一阵，我见他的眉毛突然松开了，脸上露出微笑，两眼也闪出了光来。
    “有办法了，”他高兴地说：“甭打电话了，我明儿一早就到县上去！”
    “什么办法呢？”
    “过几天猪娃下活了，你就知道了。天太冻人，你快回你的家吧。”他说着，就匆匆忙忙踩着咯吱咯吱的积雪走了。
    几天以后，我在三村就听见人们到处谈论着一个笑话。王家斌把胜利社的母猪从镐河南岸的稻地里，吆到北岸高原崖跟，借赵老二的一个冬暖夏凉的窑洞里下了猪娃。因为没料到当天夜里就会下，没指定人住在那窑洞里，弄得下了十三个猪娃，被它们愚蠢的母亲压死了两个，活了十一个。而那个说服了多次都不愿把母猪投资到社里的社员雷恩让，他的母猪是在白天下的猪娃，下了十四个。雷恩让给刚下的湿淋淋的猪娃烤着火，他的老婆用大筐提着稻草，两口子忙了一整天，饿了一整天，到天黑时，一停止烤火，十四个猪娃就一个接着一个死得硬硬了……
    人们不光谈论着胜利社这窝猪娃，还谈论着每天早晨，在白茫茫一片的雪天雪地里，胜利社的十个人一摆溜去卖豆腐，六个人一摆溜去挖大粪的浩浩荡荡的声势；谈论着胜利社的牲口在严寒中不仅没掉膘，因为喝着豆腐浆水，反而都冒膘了；谈论着区供销社因为路太坏叫不到胶轮车的时候，胜利社的胶轮车套上四个骡子，三个人赶车，给供销社拉货，保证了人民生活必需品的供应没有中断。………
    “看人家胜利社的人走步多带劲吧！”
    “多少人冻坏了手，还不挖粪就卖豆腐哩！”
    “唉！甭说那些了。大风大雪里赶车多险乎呀！”
    这些赞叹的声音，给人造成了一种鲜明的印象：劳动在胜利社的确已经不是沉重的负担，而是光荣的、豪迈的、英勇的事情了。我也没有想到：仅仅经过一年的生产和分配的成功，社员们劳动态度上就起了这样大的变化；我更没想到：年轻的王家斌只当了一年社主任，就能把一个扩大了的农业社料理得这样井井有序、生气勃勃。在秋收前扩社的时候，我还顾虑他办法不稠、考虑不细密、魄力不大，怕社大了他弄不好；而现在，许许多多的事实证明：他已经摸到一点领导的门路了。——每一个时期，他都会抓住最重要的或最困难的事情，由自己来承担！
    人们赞扬着：在胜利社新的马房牲口刚合槽的时候，家斌在那马房里睡了多少夜觉，具体地教给还没有喂过大槽牲口的饲养员应该注意些什么。胜利社的豆腐房一开头赔钱，他整天在豆腐房里，和副业上的人手研究，提高了出豆腐的份量和质量，使镇上胜利社的豆腐摊前面，买主们排起队来。后来，他主持卖了余粮、还了贷款、和供销社订了春季副业的产销合同，他就把他的全部身心都贯注在买胶轮车上。他从西安买回来两个胶轮，搭车只能搭到离村十里的地方，他就自己挑着两个轮袋往回走。翻过了神禾塬，汗水就湿透了他的棉衣，到镐河北岸，他再也挑不动了。他把轮袋寄放在乡政府，有人很关切地要他回去派人来取，可是他歇了歇气，看了一阵，还是背了一个回去了。胶轮车在大雪纷飞中，在社里社外的全村人的目送下出了车，他的注意力就又集中到那个母猪的膨胀的大肚皮上了。……
    不过，你能说这仅仅是办事的方法问题吗？不！这最主要的是一个共产党员——农民往社会主义去的引路人，全心全意为大伙办事的精神啊！
    有一天，我抽空过河南岸到王家斌的家里去了。他的母亲和媳妇用被窝盖着腿脚，坐在稻草棚棚的炕上，守着他病了的五岁的女儿彩彩。这女孩在这样严寒的季节出麻疹，发高烧，白天黑夜喊叫着“爸爸！爸爸！”我一推门，小彩彩以为是她的爸爸回来了，又喊叫着爬了起来。当她发现不是她的爸爸时，眼泪一颗跟着一颗，从她那红苹果似的小脸蛋上，扑?扑?滚了下来，小嘴唇一抽一抽地哭了。
    家斌的母亲叹口气告诉我，他不光白天不着家，黑夜不回来也有日子了。
    家斌的媳妇李凤英苦笑地说：“我到这屋里这么些年，主任啥时也没今冬里能跑。你这阵听说他在那里，赶你到那里，他早到旁处去了。”
    第二天傍黑，我偶然在皇甫村郭家十字碰到了家斌。他在那里等着胶轮车回来。他一开口，我大吃一惊，他的嗓子沙哑得简直像老猫叫唤了，似乎喉咙里堵塞了什么东西。
    “你这是怎弄的？”
    “咳嗽咳的。”他沙哑地说。
    “怎会咳得这样厉害呢？”
    “黑夜住的地方不对劲儿。”
    “你住在哪里呢？”
    他告诉我，他借住在郭家十字一家人的磨棚里。他在那里成夜地喂拉胶轮车的骡子。他解释：这一方面为了赶车的冻了一天，让他们回家去睡热炕，第二天天一亮好出车；另一方面，他一早一晚总要过河来喂社里的母猪，就索性住在河这岸来。他说咳嗽得厉害倒不完全因为天冷，他用稻糠打起一小堆火取暖，烟呛也有大关系。……
      “你去看我们的猪娃不？”他带着胜利的骄傲问我。“你看，走吧！人一进去，跑得唿??的，可亲人哩！”
    他那口气听起来，他对猪娃有多么深厚的感情啊！难道他还一点也不知道他的小彩彩在麻疹的高烧中受着折磨吗？
    实在说，我对猪娃的关心没对家斌的关心大。我问他：
      “你们的胶轮车回来，骡子为什么不送到社里的马房里去喂呢？”
    “一早一晚趟两回河，骡子腿上结冰溜子，受不住啊！”
    “走！咱们看你住的地方去。”
    我们到了他住的磨棚。没窗子，土墙上只有一个斗大的通风洞口。没门，只挂着一块稻草帘子。一边是一大摊垫好了干土的牲口粪，另一边是一小摊烧稻糠的灰烬。在这个角落里，铺着些稻草，上边掼着一个破棉袍，这就是他的宿处。我仰头看看，稻草棚棚上挂满了长长短短的灰尘丝子。……
    “同志，”我很不满意地说：“你太过分了吧？难道就没别的办法解决这个问题吗？要爱护牲口，也要爱护人啊！”
    家斌毫不为苦地笑着，沙嗓子说：“民国十八年冬里没今年冬里冻人，也差不多少。那阵我九岁，跟俺妈讨饭。先是睡在人家的大门道里，冻得着不住；后来睡在庙里，还是冻得不行。我们钻进人家烧砖瓦的窑里，不冻了；可是窑主人撵我们，我跟俺妈在雪地里哭。……”
    他见我眼里漂起泪花，不再说下去了。我承认，我的感情太脆弱，经不起这样感动人的事刺激。我这个知识分子和家斌相处了一年，从他学到的太少了；他是这样地豪迈，说着他悲惨的童年时的事，好像说着旁人的事一样！
    我们是我国第一批建设社会主义的人。历史赐予我们这样大的幸福，使我们亲眼看见无数座大建筑物从地面上冒起；通往拉萨的公路怎样修过世界屋脊，通往伊犁河畔的铁路怎样修过乌鞘岭，通往蒙古的铁路又怎样修过没水吃的草原，我们是从报上而不是从历史书上知道的。而且就在我们眼前，成百万成千万的农户带着各种复杂的感情，和几千年的生活方式永远告了别，谨小慎微地投入新的历史巨流，探索着新生活的奥秘！当我们想到我国社会主义建设的每一点成就，甚至于一个农业社的一窝猪娃这样一小点社会主义家底的积累，都是多么不容易的时候，从我们内心能不涌起对那些为社会主义而辛苦的人们的热爱吗？
          一九五五年、二月五日，皇甫村。
