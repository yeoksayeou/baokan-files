Austerity and Opposition to Waste in Capital Construction!

    Waste in the Central Institute for Nationalities' Construction
    By our reporter Gu Lei
    For several years, our Party and government have been constantly paying attention to helping our minority nationalities develop their political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings in all aspects, and caring about the training of minority nationality cadres; the establishment of the Central Institute for Nationalities in Beijing is one of the concrete manifestations of this policy. The Central Institute for Nationalities project started in 1951 and had reached a certain scale by 1954. At the beginning of its opening, there were only more than 270 students, but now it has increased to more than 1,300 students, including 46 minority nationalities. In the past few years, more than 460 students have graduated and returned to their own ethnic regions to work. According to the instructions of the Party and the government, this school will gradually be expanded to cultivate more cadres for all fraternal nationalities.
    The above achievements are commendable. But at the same time, it must be pointed out that the construction of this school has serious shortcomings, that is, due to waste in construction, the investment effect has not been fully utilized to build better houses for the fraternal nationalities.
    The Central Institute for Nationalities' school buildings are located on the west side of the West (Zhimen) Yi (He Yuan) Road in the western suburbs of Beijing. It is one of the first buildings in Beijing to adopt "national forms" in architecture after liberation. It prominently expresses the tendency to pursue form and retro style, and it is one of the architectural complexes that are neither economical nor beautiful.
    The "national form" school buildings of the Nationalities Institute are isolated low-rise buildings, and the gable roofs are all paved with gray barrel tiles and pan tiles. These roofs are different from the "palace style" in that they have no eaves; they are also different from ordinary roofs in that they have many decorations, such as owl tails and immortal beasts. The walls of the houses built in 1951 are all made of ax-cut bricks, which look gray, and the doors and windows are painted with vermilion oil. Neither the image nor the color is good-looking. The "Literature and Art Building," completed in September 1954, cost 179 yuan per square meter. A double-eaved pavilion with no practical value was built on the top floor, with glazed tiles, painted decorations, and so on. According to the original floor plan, after the completion of this architectural complex of the Nationalities Institute, there would be many pavilions and arches among them, plus other embellishments, it would be built into a modern classical architectural complex!
    People who pursue form in architecture will not cherish state funds. Because of the adoption of traditional large roofs, the construction of 13,000 square meters of houses started in 1951 by the Nationalities Institute cost 18 percent more than ordinary flat-roofed houses. Moreover, due to the heavy mud tiles, coupled with the decorations, the weight of the roof increased. The wooden frame cannot bear such a large load, and cracks often occur, costing more than 1,000 yuan in repair costs every year. Now, the auditorium is being repaired, and it has been decided to replace the lightweight tiles. In addition, using "ax-cut bricks" to build walls also wasted a lot of manpower; these bricks had to be manually polished to make the surface smooth and the brick joints neat. How necessary is this after all!
    This group of buildings is also very uneconomical in the use of land. The characteristic of this architectural complex of the Nationalities Institute is that each building has a low floor and a small building area; in order to achieve "symmetry," to form a "courtyard" and create an "space" for activities, the small building area is distributed over a large area of land. From 1951 to 1954, the total construction area of the Nationalities Institute was 42,680 square meters, with a total of 53 buildings, of which 40 were single-story bungalows; the largest area of each building was 4,374 square meters, and the smallest was only 175 square meters; these 53 buildings covered an area of 300,000 square meters. Because many buildings are scattered over a vast area, the distance between each building in the administrative and classroom areas is at least 40 meters and up to 110 meters, which also causes a series of wastes: the costs of roads, sewers, various lines, and greening must be increased. The manpower in management is also wasted as a result. For example, there are 13 boiler rooms for heating in the whole school, and 29 people are constantly serving it. The students all said: The buildings are too scattered and inconvenient when it rains. It is better to build large buildings. This is the fair judgment of the users on this building.
    Buildings must conform to the economic conditions of the time and reflect the spirit of the times, so as to educate the people to love our life—the life of socialist construction. At present, our country is concentrating its efforts on industrial construction, and it is impossible to invest a lot of money in building offices, school buildings, residences, and public buildings. Therefore, we must use the only funds to build more houses under the premise of ensuring applicability and simple beauty to meet the needs of the majority of people. However, the architecture of the Nationalities Institute is just the opposite. For example, the "Literature and Art Building" alone wasted 22,000 yuan. According to statistics, if all the buildings of the Nationalities Institute were flat-roofed, 840,000 yuan could be saved, and more than 8,000 square meters of dormitories could be built. Unfortunately, people who pursue form have forgotten this! In 1951, because the cost of the large roof exceeded the investment standard, the school even reduced the construction plan of more than 2,500 square meters of dormitories for cadres and service personnel. This practice is obviously divorced from my country's current economic conditions and people's living standards. As for the architectural image of the Nationalities Institute, it is only a uncritical imitation of classical architecture. For example, the "owl tail" on the main ridge, according to various records in history books, this thing has only existed since the Han Dynasty. It has no structural and practical value in architecture. It is just a "spiritual fire extinguisher." It is a product of feudal society that puts the hope of peace on illusory superstition. Li Mingzhong, the editor of "Yingzao Fashi" in the Song Dynasty, also pointed out that its origin began in the Han Dynasty, because "After the disaster of the Berlin Hall, the Yue witches said that there are fish dragons in the sea, whose tails are like owls, and waves will cause rain; therefore, their image is made on the roof to suppress the fire." Other immortal animals and beasts are just auspicious ornaments symbolizing the feudal era. What do they have in common with the era we are in? The era we are in is full of labor, struggle, light, and the vigorous feelings of progress, but this architectural sentiment is decadent, decadent, and nihilistic. What connection does it have with the people's feelings?
    The architectural form of the Nationalities Institute was fiercely debated at the beginning. Zhang Kaiji, the designer of the school building project at the beginning, initially designed a ordinary foreign tile four-slope roof. Because the leading cadres in charge of capital construction of the Nationalities Institute disagreed, he changed it to a flat roof with Chinese floral decorations, which was barely approved. At this time, some cadres and architects suggested that the Nationalities Institute adopt "national forms," and the construction unit agreed to this opinion. Of course, it is not bad to consider adopting national forms, but because the people who proposed it did not study it well, and did not inherit the national architectural heritage with a critical attitude, the result was the current form. At that time, Zhang Kaiji and some of the designers opposed this practice for two reasons: one was whether the Nationalities Institute should adopt this form should be carefully considered; the other was that the budget investment was not much, and if a large roof was used, at least 10% more investment would be added. For this reason, Zhang Kaiji drew two drawings, one with a foreign tile four-slope roof and the other with a large roof. In order to negate the large roof, he drew the former very large and beautiful, and the latter small and simple. As a result, the two sides were deadlocked, so someone suggested to find Professor Liang Sicheng to solve the problem, because he was studying and advocating national forms. When they went, they brought the previous two drawings. As a result, Mr. Liang Sicheng approved the design of the "national form," which resulted in the current style of architecture. In this process, Mr. Liang Sicheng also made two supplements to the design: making the windows square and painting the doors and windows vermilion, believing that this is a unique form and color of Chinese architecture. Mr. Liang Sicheng liked this architectural form very much, and at the inaugural meeting of the Architectural Society, he praised it greatly, believing that it was beautiful and economical.
    However, facts speak louder than words. This building is neither economical nor beautiful. For the construction unit, this is an act of not cherishing state funds, not paying attention to investment effects, and extravagance and waste; for the architects and "authorities" who advocated and supported this architectural form, it is a simple and rude attitude towards the national architectural form, simply imitating ancient buildings, being divorced from the times, being divorced from the people, being divorced from the policies of the Party and the government, and leading the architecture to the realm of "formalism." This is a terrible and dangerous road. These are the lessons that this building of the Nationalities Institute has taught us!

### 中央民族学院建筑中的浪费

    中央民族学院建筑中的浪费
    本报记者　顾雷
    几年来，我们的党和政府时刻注意从各方面帮助我国少数民族发展政治、经济和文化建设事业，关心少数民族干部培养工作；北京中央民族学院的建立就是这个政策的具体表现之一。中央民族学院工程由一九五一年开始，到一九五四年已具有一定的规模。刚开学时，只有学生二百七十余名，现在已增至一千三百余人，包括四十六个少数民族。几年来，已有四百六十余名学生毕业，返回自己民族地区进行工作。根据党和政府的指示，这个学校还将逐步地扩大，为各兄弟民族培养出更多干部。
    上述成绩是值得赞扬的。但同时也不能不指出，这个学校的建筑工程是有严重缺点的，这就是由于建筑中的浪费，没有充分发挥投资效果，给各民族兄弟盖起更好的房子。
    中央民族学院的校舍，座落在北京西郊西（直门）颐（和园）路西侧。它是北京解放后在建筑上采用“民族形式”的第一批建筑，它突出地表现了追求形式和复古的倾向，它是既不经济又不美观的建筑群之一。
    民族学院“民族形式”的校舍是一幢一幢孤立的低层建筑，人字屋顶上全部铺用灰色筒瓦和乾克瓦，这些屋顶同“宫殿式”的不同，它没有飞檐；也与普通的屋顶不同，它有许多装饰，如鸱尾和仙人仙兽。一九五一年盖的房屋的墙壁，都是用斧刃砖贴成，望去一片灰色，而门窗都涂上银朱油。无论形象和色调，都是不好看的。一九五四年九月完工的“文艺楼”，每平方公尺造价一百七十九元。楼上盖了一个毫无适用价值的两重檐的角亭，有琉璃瓦、油漆彩画等装饰。按照原来的平面图，民族学院这个建筑群完成后，其中还有许多亭子和牌坊，再加上其他陪衬，便会建成近代的古典建筑群了！
    在建筑上追求形式的人，是不会爱惜国家资金的。因为采用传统的大屋顶，民族学院于一九五一年动工建筑的一万三千平方公尺房屋的造价比一般平屋顶的房屋要多百分之十八。而且由于泥瓦太重，再加上装饰，就使房顶重量增加。木制的房架无法承受这样大的荷重，常发生裂开现象，每年都要花一千多元修理费。现在，正在修补礼堂，并决定重新换上份量轻的瓦。此外，用“斧刃砖”砌墙也浪费了很大的人力；这些砖都要经过人工磨过，以求表面平滑，砖缝整齐。这究竟有多少必要呢！
    这群建筑在使用土地方面也非常不经济。民族学院这个建筑群的特点是每幢房子的楼层矮，建筑面积小；为了“对称”，为了形成“庭院”和造成活动的“空间”，把很小的建筑面积分布在很大
  一片土地上。由一九五一年到一九五四年，民族学院总建筑面积为四万二千六百八十平方公尺，计五十三幢房屋，其中一层的平房竟有四十幢之多；每幢最大的面积是四千三百七十四平方公尺，最小的才一百七十五平方公尺；这五十三幢房子占地三十万平方公尺。因为许多幢房子分散在广阔的面积上，行政、教室区的每幢楼之间的距离少则四十公尺，多则一百一十公尺，还引起一系列的浪费：道路、上下水道、各种线路、绿化等费用都必须增加。管理方面的人力也因而浪费，例如供暖用的锅炉房全校就有十三个，经常有二十九个人为它服务。学生们都说：楼太分散，下雨时不方便，不如盖大楼好。这就是使用者对于这个建筑的公正的判决。
    建筑物必须符合当时的经济条件，反映时代的精神面貌，以此教育人民热爱我们的生活——社会主义建设的生活。目前，我国正集中力量进行工业建设，不可能大量投资修建办公室、校舍、住宅和公共建筑。因此，就必须利用仅有的资金，在保证适用和朴素的美的条件下，盖起更多的房子，满足多数人的需要。而民族学院的建筑恰恰相反。例如，仅“文艺楼”就浪费了二万二千元。据统计，如果民族学院的建筑全部采用平顶，可节省八十四万元，可以盖八千多平方公尺宿舍。可惜，追求形式的人把这点忘记了！一九五一年，该校因为大屋顶造价超过投资标准，甚至削减了二千五百多平方公尺的干部和勤杂人员的宿舍修建计划。这种做法显然是脱离我国目前经济条件和人民生活水平的。至于民族学院的建筑形象也只是毫无批判的对古典建筑的摹仿。例如正脊上的“鸱尾”，根据史书上各种记载，自汉朝才有这种东西，它在建筑中没有任何结构和适用上的价值，只是一种“精神消火器”，是封建社会里把平安的希望寄托在虚无的迷信上的产物。宋朝李明仲编著的“营造法式”也指出它的来源是开始于汉朝，因“柏梁殿灾后，越巫言海中有鱼虬，尾似鸱，激浪即降雨；遂作其象于屋，以厌火祥。”其他仙人走兽等也只是封建时代象征吉祥的饰物，与我们所处的时代有何相同之处呢？我们所处的时代充满着劳动、斗争、光明、进取的朝气勃勃的情感，而这个建筑情调却是消沉、颓废、虚无的，与人民的感情有何联系呢？
    民族学院的建筑形式，在开始时有过激烈的争论。校舍工程开始的设计者张开济，开始设计出的式样是普通洋瓦四坡的屋顶，因民族学院负责基本建设的领导干部不同意，随改成平屋顶，外加中国的花饰，勉强通过。这时，有些干部和建筑师建议民族学院采用“民族形式”，建筑单位同意了这个意见。当然，考虑采用民族形式并不坏，但由于提议的人没有很好研究，不是以批判的态度继承民族建筑遗产，结果选用了现在的这个形式。当时，张开济和部分参加设计的人员反对这个做法，理由有两个：一个是民族学院是否应该采用这种形式，应慎重考虑；一个是预算投资不多，如采用大屋顶至少要追加投资百分之十以上。为此，张开济画了两份图，一份是洋瓦四坡屋顶，另一份是大屋顶。他为了否定大屋顶，把前者画得很大、很漂亮，把后者画得小而且简陋。结果，双方僵持不下，于是有人提议找梁思成教授解决，因为他正研究和提倡民族形式。去的时候，带上前面那两张图。结果，梁思成先生批准了“民族形式”的那张设计，这就产生现在这个式样的建筑。在这个过程中，梁思成先生还对设计提出两点补充：把窗子做成正方形，把门窗漆成朱红色，认为这是中国建筑特有的形式和色调。梁思成先生很喜欢这个建筑形式，在建筑学会成立大会上还对它倍加赞扬，认为它是美观的，经济的。
    但是，事实胜于雄辩。这座建筑是既不经济，也不美观的。对建筑单位说来，这是不爱护国家资金、不顾惜投资效果、铺张浪费的行为；对提倡、支持这一建筑形式的建筑师和“权威”者说来，则是用简单粗暴的态度对待民族的建筑形式，单纯摹仿古代建筑，脱离时代，脱离人民，脱离党和政府的政策，把建筑引上了“形式主义”的境地。这是可怕的、危险的道路。这些，就是民族学院这个建筑给我们的教训！
