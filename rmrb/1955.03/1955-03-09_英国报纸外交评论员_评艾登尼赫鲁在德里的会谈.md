Xinhua News Agency, London, March 6th: Newspaper diplomatic commentators, commenting on the talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Indian Prime Minister Nehru in Delhi, said that Nehru seemed to have agreed with Eden's position on the Taiwan issue.

      The "Observer's" Delhi dispatch said that Nehru and Eden had agreed to recommend holding a "Geneva-style conference," the purpose of which was said to be only to "affirm the de facto ceasefire." At the same time, they "have decided that before holding this meeting, diplomatic channels should be used to reach a consensus on the members and agenda of the meeting. Some people are trying to allow all parties involved in the conflict to participate in the meeting," which is obviously to win a place for the Chiang Kai-shek elements at this meeting as well. However, this is undermining the national rights of the Chinese people and violating Prime Minister Nehru's own statement made not long ago.
    After the newspaper published such news, British journalists expressed surprise, reminding that India has recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government of China, and that Nehru said in a speech to the People's Assembly of the Indian Parliament on February 25 that if a certain country has recognized China, it should recognize according to the logic of facts: Formosa (Taiwan) also belongs to China.

    英国报纸外交评论员
    评艾登尼赫鲁在德里的会谈
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社伦敦六日讯：报纸外交评论员评述英国外交大臣艾登同印度总理尼赫鲁在德里的会谈，说尼赫鲁似乎已经同意了艾登在台湾问题上的立场。
      “观察家报”的德里消息说，尼赫鲁和艾登已经谈妥要建议举行“日内瓦式会议”，而其目的据说只是为了“肯定事实上的停火”。同时他们“已经决定，在举行这个会议以前，应当通过外交途径，以便就参加会议的成员和会议的议程问题取得一致的意见。有人企图让与冲突有关各方都能参加会议，”这显然就是要替蒋介石分子也在这次会议上争得一个位置，然而这是破坏中国人民的民族权利，违反尼赫鲁总理自己不久以前发表的声明的。
    报纸刊载了这样的消息后，英国新闻界人士表示惊奇，他们提醒说，印度已经承认中华人民共和国政府是中国唯一合法的政府，而且尼赫鲁二月二十五日在印度国会人民院演说时说过，如果有某个国家已经承认中国，它就应当根据事实的逻辑承认：福摩萨（台湾）也是属于中国的。
