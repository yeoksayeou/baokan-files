He first congratulated the republic on winning this highest award. He said that this highest award marks the deep respect, gratitude, and love of all nationalities of the Soviet Union for the great Russian people. Voroshilov then talked about the strength of the friendship between the peoples of various countries. He pointed out: We Soviet people consider it our sacred duty to do our best to strengthen our great socialist and democratic camp, because the strength of this camp is the most reliable guarantee of world peace. In the future, we will also expand brotherly cooperation and strengthen friendship with the great Chinese people and the working people of various people's democratic countries. We firmly defend peace, but no threats can frighten us. If the imperialists once again provoke a new world war, then the result will not be the destruction of civilization, but the end of the capitalist system. Voroshilov said: The working people all over the world know that the aggressors have not been able to launch a new war until now, to a large extent thanks to the Soviet Union, great China, and the people's democratic countries, thanks to their firm and clear peace policy, and also thanks to the great contribution of the Republic of India to strengthening peace and the friendship of the people of all countries.

    在二十四、二十五日两天的会议上，代表们听取了预算委员会的副报告，并就一九五五年俄罗斯联邦国家预算的报告和副报告展开了讨论。
