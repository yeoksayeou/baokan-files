Chairman, distinguished guests, comrades:

    It has been thirty years since the death of the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen! Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to the struggle for China's freedom and equality. The Chinese people will forever hold Dr. Sun Yat-sen in high esteem and commemorate him sincerely!

    Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a great revolutionary democrat who stood at the forefront of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. He not only devoted himself tirelessly to the revolution throughout his life, persevering and fighting to the end, but also kept pace with the times, constantly developing his political thought and revolutionary cause.

    Chairman Mao once pointed out: "The bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism in China, properly speaking, began with Dr. Sun Yat-sen." When the Xingzhonghui was founded in 1895, Dr. Sun Yat-sen proposed the revolutionary idea of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing a united government. In 1905, when the Tongmenghui was established, Dr. Sun Yat-sen further proposed the political program of establishing a republic and equalizing land rights. He waged a resolute struggle against the reformists, represented by Kang Youwei, who defended the Qing government's position, ideologically clearing away the obstacles of reformism to the revolution. In 1911, under the leadership of the Tongmenghui headed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Xinhai Revolution, which had great historical significance, finally broke out, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's more than two hundred years of autocratic rule, ending China's more than two thousand years of feudal monarchy, and deeply rooting the concept of a democratic republic in the hearts of the people.

    Due to the lack of a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program, and the failure to mobilize and organize the power of the people, the Xinhai Revolution ultimately failed. After the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, although Dr. Sun Yat-sen continued to wage unyielding struggles against the Beiyang warlord government, these struggles still did not succeed because he did not mobilize and organize the people, and in the situation where the warlords and imperialism colluded with each other, he became increasingly isolated and helpless. In 1924, when the Kuomintang was reorganized, Dr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out painfully the situation in China at that time, saying: "Since the Xinhai Revolution, up to the present, China's situation has not only not progressed, but has also been declining. The tyranny of the warlords and the erosion of the powers have become increasingly severe, plunging China deep into the hell of a semi-colonial state. This is what the people of the whole country are deeply worried about, and what insightful people are wandering day and night, eager to find a way out for the people of the whole country."

    The great victory of the Russian October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history and also a new era in the revolution of colonies and semi-colonies. Dr. Sun Yat-sen sent a telegram to Lenin congratulating the victory of the October Revolution, expressing his heartfelt longing for this great revolution. In 1919, the "May Fourth" Movement broke out in China, and in 1921, the Communist Party of China was founded. From then on, the Chinese revolution entered a new historical period, that is, from the period of the old democratic revolution to the period of the new democratic revolution, and became a part of the proletarian world revolution. The success of the Russian October Revolution and the founding of the Communist Party of China were unprecedented changes in world and Chinese history, which had a tremendous impact on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's political thought and revolutionary cause. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "Sun Yat-sen met the October Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party in despair. Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the Russian people's help to the Chinese people, and welcomed the Chinese Communist Party to cooperate with him."

    The Declaration of the Second National Congress of the Communist Party of China scientifically analyzed and summarized the reasons for the failure of the old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie in the past, correctly explained the situation in China at that time and the relationship between imperialism and warlord rule, and put forward to the people of the whole country the political program of struggle at that time and the slogans of "Down with the warlords" and "Down with international imperialism." This had an extremely profound and important impact on Dr. Sun Yat-sen. In his "Northern Expedition Declaration," he said: "The purpose of the national revolution is to create an independent and free country to protect the interests of the country and the people. This purpose is absolutely incompatible with the imperialism that wants to make China its colony forever." "The purpose of the Northern Expedition is not only to overthrow the warlords, but also to overthrow the imperialism on which the warlords depend for their survival."

    The reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang in 1924 was an important event in Chinese history. In the Declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, Dr. Sun Yat-sen reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People and clearly put forward the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks of the Chinese revolution and the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, so that the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the minimum program of the Communist Party of China - New Democracy - reached a basic consensus on several principles. At the same time, the reorganized Kuomintang established an alliance with the Communist Party of China against imperialism and feudalism, formed a people's democratic united front led by the working class, and launched a new revolutionary struggle.

    "Taking Russia as a teacher" and "Following the path of the Russian people" were important signs of the development of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's thought. Dr. Sun Yat-sen recognized the Soviet Union from the Soviet Union's policy towards China and its specific assistance to him, and he was determined to learn from the Soviet Union. He said: "The French and American republics are old-fashioned. Today, only Russia is new-fashioned. We should create a most new-fashioned republic today." "In the politics and society of Britain and the United States, there are still rich and poor classes. In the current Russia, there are no classes. Such a country is the new world we want to create." He pointed out more than once that China "must learn from Russia for today's revolution" and that China "will have no success in future revolutions without taking Russia as a teacher." When talking about the relationship between China and the Soviet Union, Dr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out that the friendship between the two countries was not built on general diplomatic relations, but on the basis of common revolutionary goals. He said to Japanese newspaper reporters in Nagasaki: "The purpose of the Chinese revolution is the same as that of Russia... The Chinese and Russian revolutions are both following the same path, so China and Russia are not only friendly, but also truly a family in terms of revolutionary relations."

    Unfortunately, just as Dr. Sun Yat-sen found the correct path for the Chinese revolution and was fighting resolutely for his great ideals, the heart of this great revolutionary stopped beating! But even on his deathbed, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was still concerned about the fate and future of his motherland, and still remembered to consolidate the revolutionary friendship between China and the Soviet Union and to obtain assistance from the Soviet Union for the Chinese revolution. In his letter to the Soviet Union, he said: "Dear comrades of the Central Executive Committee of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: I am suffering from an incurable disease here. My thoughts at this time turn to you, to my party and to the future of my country... I have ordered the Kuomintang to continue to cooperate with you. I firmly believe that your government will continue to provide assistance to our country as before. Dear comrades! At this moment of farewell to you, I would like to express my warm hope that dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory." At the same time, in his will, Dr. Sun Yat-sen summarized the most valuable experience he had gained in his forty years of revolution, which was that in order to achieve victory in the revolution, "we must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally to fight together!"

    As Stalin predicted in his telegram of condolence for Dr. Sun Yat-sen: "Sun Yat-sen's great cause will not die with Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen's cause will live in the hearts of Chinese workers and peasants, making the enemies of the Chinese people fear." The people of the whole country mourned this great revolutionary, launched extensive political propaganda, and set off a new revolutionary upsurge. The Chinese people launched the first domestic revolutionary war and achieved great victories. At that time, the people, under the leadership of the working class, waged a resolute struggle against imperialism and feudal forces with unparalleled bravery. International imperialists, in order to strangle the Chinese revolution, colluded with the feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie of China to carry out sabotage from within. Just as the Northern Expedition War was proceeding victoriously, Chiang Kai-shek, who represented the feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie, defected to imperialism and betrayed Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolution. From then on, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in China entered a more arduous, more intense, and more acute stage.

    Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy": "In today's international environment, any heroes and good men in colonies and semi-colonies must either stand on the side of the imperialist front and become a part of the world's counter-revolutionary forces, or stand on the anti-imperialist front and become a part of the world's revolutionary forces. One of the two must be chosen; there is no other way." The struggle between these two fronts became even more obvious after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. On the one hand, Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of imperialism, relied on imperialism even more thoroughly than the previous reactionary rulers and suppressed the revolutionary people more cruelly. During the more than twenty years of bloody rule by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, the Chinese people suffered unprecedented hardships, the crisis of the Chinese nation became even more serious, and the imperialist aggression, oppression, and exploitation of China reached an unparalleled level of frenzy. On the other hand, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, resolutely carried out revolutionary struggles against imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. During the long period of darkness and terror when the bandit Chiang Kai-shek carried out unprecedented bloody massacres against the revolutionary people, as Chairman Mao said, the heroic Chinese Communists "were not frightened, conquered, or killed off. They crawled out of the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the corpses of their comrades, and continued to fight." After the Land Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, the Chinese people finally achieved the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949, ending the long history of oppression and enslavement, establishing the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship, and completing the first stage of the Chinese revolution.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have victoriously carried out the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and various social reform movements, rapidly restored the national economy destroyed by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries, and began to implement the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in 1953. The First National People's Congress was convened in 1954, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China was promulgated. China's international status has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and it occupies an important position in international affairs. The People's Republic of China has formed an unbreakable friendly alliance with the great socialist Soviet Union, and has established fraternal friendship with the people's democratic countries. This great alliance and friendship is an invincible force for defending peace in the Far East and the world, and for defending the freedom and happiness of mankind. Now, the Chinese people are confidently fighting to build China into a great socialist country. Therefore, today we are here to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and we can proudly say that in the past thirty years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have not only turned Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong ideals into reality, but have also far surpassed them.

    The path and victory of the Chinese revolution after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen clearly and vividly illustrate a truth: that the Chinese revolution must be led by the working class and its political party, the Communist Party of China, in order to achieve the goal of victory. In the past thirty years, the democratic classes, democratic parties, and other patriotic democratic elements throughout the country have gradually recognized this truth from revolutionary practice, and have successively united around the Communist Party of China to form a broad people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's followers - the Kuomintang democrats - have accepted countless lessons in the revolutionary struggle, have also successively recognized this truth, have continued Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, and have participated in the struggle of the people's revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. In the future, in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, we will more earnestly accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, continue to contribute our strength, and play our role.

    Comrades! Today we are here to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and we express our unparalleled anger at the fact that Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor and betrayer of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, is still entrenched in Taiwan, continuing to carry out the criminal acts of betraying the motherland and harming the people!

    After being driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek entrenched himself in Taiwan, carrying out cruel oppression and plunder of the Taiwan compatriots, harassing and destroying the coastal areas of the mainland, and further colluding with US imperialism, signing the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with US imperialism, completely selling out Taiwan to US imperialism as a base for US imperialism to invade our mainland and undermine peace in the Far East. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate Chiang Kai-shek's monstrous crimes. We firmly oppose US imperialist aggression and are determined to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!

    As early as 1923, Dr. Sun Yat-sen strongly protested against imperialist interference in China's internal affairs and firmly stated: "There was a period in the past when we worked hard to overthrow the Qing Dynasty; now we will begin a period to overthrow imperialist interference in China," demanding "that the phenomenon of the combination of force and imperialism should disappear forever from the country." Dr. Sun Yat-sen's protest and demands fully reflected the will and determination of the Chinese people at that time. Today, the victorious, liberated, and standing-up Chinese people absolutely cannot allow any country to interfere in China's internal affairs, undermine China's sovereignty, or occupy China's territory in any way. Now, the US imperialists openly occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan and Penghu, carry out war threats against the Chinese people, and attempt to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. This arrogant and unreasonable act of aggression by US imperialism can only arouse greater anger from the Chinese people and cannot shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan in the slightest! If US imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we will definitely wipe out the invaders!

    While clamoring for war, US imperialism is also colluding with its vassal states to create a "ceasefire" conspiracy, attempting to use the name of the United Nations to interfere in our internal affairs and divide our territory. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy. We fully support the Soviet government's proposal to Britain and India on February 4 to convene an international conference to discuss the dangerous situation in Taiwan and other Chinese coastal island areas. The matter is very clear: the dangerous situation in this region is entirely caused by the US armed occupation of Taiwan and interference in our internal affairs. Therefore, the United Nations and any international conference can only discuss the issue of US interference in China's internal affairs and aggression against Chinese territory. As for the Chinese people liberating Taiwan, that is entirely China's internal affair, and the United Nations and any international conference have no right to interfere. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a public enemy of the Chinese people. It cannot represent anyone, and it has no qualification to attend any international conference at all. Also, the so-called "neutralization" of Taiwan, "trusteeship" of Taiwan, and the absurd statements of "two Chinas" are all absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

    From his lifelong struggle experience, Dr. Sun Yat-sen fully realized that in order to stop imperialist aggression, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against the aggressors. In the Guangzhou Merchant Corps Incident in 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was not subdued by British armed interference, and finally crushed the attempt of British imperialism to interfere in China's internal affairs at that time. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated peace, and at the same time, he realized that only by resolutely stopping imperialist aggression can true peace be obtained. Today we are here to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and we want to declare to the world once again: the Chinese people advocate peace, but they will never sacrifice national territorial sovereignty to beg for peace. The Chinese people oppose war, but they will never be intimidated by any war threats. The Chinese people have the full strength to liberate all coastal islands, liberate Penghu, and liberate Taiwan victoriously, just like liberating Yijiangshan Island, Dachen Island, and Nanjishan Island!

    Here, I want to tell those who followed the bandit Chiang to Taiwan, especially those old Kuomintang members who once followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen, that on the occasion of commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, they should faithfully uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, recognize the crimes of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in betraying the country and harming the people, distinguish between right and wrong, see the general trend clearly, respond to the call of the people of the motherland, abandon the darkness and turn to the light as early as possible, and return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the only bright road!

    Comrades! Dr. Sun Yat-sen fought for the independence and freedom of the motherland throughout his life, fighting against imperialism and feudalism. In his fighting life, he always showed the characteristics of daring to criticize himself and constantly seeking progress. Under the influence of the great October Revolution and with the help of the Communist Party of China, he achieved a high level of ideological and political achievement in his later years, pointing out the correct path for China's revolutionary democrats to unite with the international and domestic proletarian movement to strive for China's national independence. This thought continued to play an active role in the Chinese revolution until the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and became a powerful weapon for the Kuomintang democrats to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries. Today we are here to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and I want to call on the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to emulate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit of "constant progress, perseverance, and tireless learning," earnestly accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, strive to transform our thinking, work diligently and honestly, and in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose US imperialist aggression, fully play our role and contribute all our strength.

    The great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, will be immortal!

    在孙中山先生逝世三十周年纪念大会上
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深的讲话主席、各位先生、各位同志：
    伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生逝世已经三十周年了！孙中山先生为争取中国之自由平等，贡献了他的一生。中国人民对孙中山先生永远怀着崇高的敬意和真挚的纪念！
    孙中山先生是一个伟大的革命民主主义者，在中国人民进行民主革命的过程中，他是站在斗争的前列的。他不仅终生不倦地献身于革命，百折不挠，奋斗到底，而且能够跟着时代前进，不断地发展着他的政治思想和革命事业。
    毛主席曾经指出：“中国反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命，正规的说起来，是从孙中山先生开始的。”一八九五年兴中会成立时，孙中山先生就曾提出了推翻满清、建立合众政府的革命主张。一九○五年同盟会成立，孙中山先生又进一步提出了建立民国、平均地权的政治纲领。他对维护满清政府立场的、以康有为为代表的改良派进行了坚决的斗争，从思想上扫清了改良主义对革命的障碍。一九一一年在以孙中山先生为首的同盟会的领导下，终于爆发了具有伟大历史意义的辛亥革命，推翻了满清两百多年的专制统治，结束了中国两千多年的封建帝制，使民主共和国的观念从此深入人心。
    由于没有一个彻底的反帝反封建的纲领，没有发动和组织可以依靠的人民大众的力量，辛亥革命终于失败了。辛亥革命失败以后，孙中山先生虽然继续对北洋军阀政府进行着不屈不挠的斗争，但是仍然因为没有发动和组织人民大众，在军阀与帝国主义互相勾结的形势下，这些斗争没有得到成功，并且愈来愈陷于孤立无助的地步。孙中山先生在一九二四年国民党改组时，曾沉痛地指出当时中国的情况说：“自辛亥革命以后，以迄于今，中国之情况，不但无进步可言，且有江河日下之势。军阀之专横，列强之侵蚀，日益加厉，令中国深入半殖民地之泥犁地狱。此全国人民所为疾首蹙额，而有识者所以彷徨日夜，急欲为全国人民求一生路者也。”
    俄国十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，也开辟了殖民地和半殖民地革命的新纪元。孙中山先生致电列宁祝贺十月革命的胜利，表达了他对于这一伟大革命的衷心向往。一九一九年，中国发生了“五四”运动，一九二一年，中国共产党成立，从此，中国革命进入了一个新的历史时期，就是从旧民主主义革命时期转入到新民主主义革命时期，而成为无产阶级世界革命的一部分。俄国十月革命的成功，中国共产党的成立，这是自有世界历史和中国历史以来无可比拟的变化，对于孙中山先生的政治思想和革命事业也发生了巨大的影响。正如毛主席所指出的“孙中山在绝望里遇到了十月革命和中国共产党，孙中山欢迎十月革命，欢迎俄国人对中国人的帮助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作。”
    中国共产党第二次全国代表大会宣言科学地分析和总结了过去资产阶级领导的旧民主主义革命失败的原因，正确地说明了当时中国的局势以及帝国主义与军阀统治的关系，向全国人民提出了当时斗争的政治纲领和“打倒军阀”“打倒国际帝国主义”的口号，这给孙中山先生以极其深刻和重要的影响，他在“北上宣言”中说：“国民革命之目的，在造成独立自由之国家，以拥护国家及民众之利益，此种目的，与帝国主义欲使中国永为其殖民地者，绝对不能相容。”“北伐之目的，不仅在推倒军阀，尤在推倒军阀所赖以生存之帝国主义。”
    一九二四年中国国民党的改组是中国历史上的一个重要事件。孙中山先生在中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中，重新解释了三民主义，并明确地提出了中国革命反帝反封建的任务和联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，使革命的三民主义同中国共产党的最低纲领——新民主主义在若干原则上达到了基本上的一致。同时改组后的国民党同中国共产党建立了反帝反封建的联盟，结成了以工人阶级为领导的人民民主统一战线，展开了新的革命斗争。
    “以俄为师”“走俄国人的路”是孙中山先生思想发展的重要的标志。孙中山先生从苏联对中国的政策和对他的具体帮助中，认识了苏联，并且决心学习苏联。他说：“法美共和皆旧式的，今日惟俄国是新式的，吾人今日应造成一最新式的共和国”“在英美的政治社会至今还有贫富阶级，在现在的俄国，什么阶级也没有，像这样的国家，就是我们要造成的新世界。”他不止一次地指出：中国“今日革命非学俄国不可”，中国“今后之革命，非以俄为师断无成就。”在谈到中国和苏联的关系的时候，孙中山先生曾明白地指出，两国的友谊不是建筑在一般的外交关系上，而是建筑在有着共同的革命目标的基础上，他对长崎日本新闻记者说：“中国革命的目的，和俄国相同。……中国和俄国革命都是走一条路，所以中国同俄国不只是亲善，照革命的关系，实在是一家。”
    不幸的是，正当孙中山先生找到了中国革命的正确道路并为他伟大的理想进行坚决斗争的时候，这个伟大的革命家的心脏停止跳动了！但孙中山先生就是在弥留之际，还是心系着自己祖国的命运和前途，还是念念不忘地要巩固中国同苏联的革命友谊，要向苏联取得对中国革命的援助。他在给苏联的遗书中说：“苏维埃社会主义共和国大联合中央执行委员会亲爱的同志：我在此身患不治之症。我的心念，此时转向于你们，转向于我党及我国的将来。……我已命国民党长此继续与你们提携。我深信你们政府亦必继续前此予我国之援助。亲爱的同志！当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”孙中山先生同时在他的遗嘱里，总结了他革命四十年所得到的一条最宝贵的经验，就是要使革命达到胜利，“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗！”
    正如斯大林在悼唁孙中山先生的电文中所预料的：“孙中山的伟大事业是不会随着孙中山一同死去的，孙中山的事业将活在中国工人与农民的心中，使中国人民的敌人望而生畏。”全国人民哀悼这个伟大的革命家，展开了广泛的政治宣传，掀起了新的革命高潮，中国人民发动了第一次国内革命战争，并取得了重大的胜利。当时在工人阶级领导下的人民大众，无比英勇地对帝国主义和封建势力进行了坚决的斗争，而国际帝国主义者为了扼杀中国革命，勾结中国的封建地主和买办资产阶级，从内部来进行破坏。正当北伐战争胜利进行的中途，代表封建地主和买办资产阶级的蒋介石就投靠帝国主义，背叛了孙中山先生，背叛了革命。从此中国革命与反革命的斗争进入了更艰苦、更激烈、更尖锐的阶段。
    毛泽东主席在“新民主主义论”中，曾经指出：“处在今天的国际环境中，殖民地半殖民地的任何英雄好汉们，要就是站在帝国主义战线方面，变为世界反革命力量的一部分；要就是站在反帝国主义战线方面，变为世界革命力量的一部分。二者必居其一，其他的道路是没有的。”这两条战线的斗争，从孙中山先生逝世以后，表现得更为明显。一方面是帝国主义的走狗蒋介石，比以前的反动统治者更加彻底地依靠帝国主义，更加残酷地镇压革命人民，在蒋介石反动集团血腥统治的二十多年中，中国人民遭受空前的苦难，中国民族的危机更加深重，帝国主义对中国的侵略压迫和榨取达到了无比疯狂的地步。一方面是中国人民，在伟大的中国共产党领导之下，对帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团，坚决进行革命的斗争。在蒋贼介石对革命人民实行空前未有的血腥屠杀，全国处在黑暗恐怖的长时期内，诚如毛主席所说，英勇的中国共产党人“并没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝。他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”经过土地革命战争、抗日战争和解放战争，中国人民终于在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，结束了长期被压迫、被奴役的历史，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，完成了中国革命的第一阶段的任务。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，胜利地进行了抗美援朝的斗争和各种社会改革运动，迅速地恢复了被帝国主义和蒋介石国民党反动派破坏了的国民经济，在一九五三年开始实行了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，一九五四年召开了第一届全国人民代表大会，颁布了中华人民共和国宪法。中国的国际地位已经空前提高，在国际事务中居于重要的地位，中华人民共和国同伟大的社会主义苏联结成了牢不可破的友好同盟，同各人民民主国家建立了兄弟般的友谊，这种伟大的同盟和友谊，是保卫远东及世界和平、保卫人类的自由幸福的无敌的力量。现在，中国人民正满怀信心地为把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争。因此，今天我们在这里纪念孙中山先生逝世三十周年，我们可以骄傲地说，三十年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，不仅把孙中山先生奋斗一生的理想变成了现实，而且远远超过了。
    孙中山先生逝世以后中国革命所经历的道路及其胜利，都清楚地、生动地向我们说明了一条真理：就是中国革命必须由工人阶级及其政党中国共产党领导，才能达到胜利的目的。三十年来，全国各民主阶级、各民主党派和其他爱国民主分子，从革命实践中逐渐认识了这个真理，先后团结在中国共产党周围，组成了以中国共产党为领导的、广泛的人民民主统一战线。孙中山先生的信徒——国民党民主派接受了在革命斗争中的无数教训，也先后认识了这个真理，继续了孙中山先生的革命精神，在中国共产党领导下参加了人民革命的斗争。今后在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，在反对国内外敌人的斗争中，更将切实接受中国共产党的领导，继续贡献力量，发挥作用。
    同志们！我们今天在这里纪念孙中山先生，对于孙中山先生的叛徒卖国贼蒋介石至今仍然盘踞台湾，继续进行着叛卖祖国危害人民的罪恶勾当，表示无比的愤怒！
    卖国贼蒋介石被中国人民逐出大陆以后，盘踞台湾，对台湾同胞进行残酷的压迫和掠夺，对大陆沿海地区，进行骚扰和破坏，并且进一步的勾结美帝国主义，和美帝国主义签订所谓“共同防御条约”，把台湾完全出卖给美帝国主义，作为美帝国主义侵犯我国大陆和破坏远东和平的基地。中国人民对蒋贼这种滔天罪行，绝对不能容忍，我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略，一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团！
    孙中山先生远在一九二三年就曾强烈抗议帝国主义干涉中国的内政，坚决表示：“从前有一时期，为努力推翻满清；今将开始一时期，为推翻帝国主义之干涉中国”，要求“使武力与帝国主义相结合的现象，永远绝迹于国内”。孙中山先生这种抗议和要求，充分反映了当时中国人民的意志和决心。今天胜利了、解放了的、站立起来了的中国人民绝对不能容许任何国家以任何方式干涉中国的内政，破坏中国的主权，霸占中国的领土。现在美帝国主义者，公然霸占我们的神圣领土台湾和澎湖，对中国人民进行战争威胁，妄图阻挠中国人民解放台湾。美帝国主义这种蛮横无理的侵略行为，只能引起中国人民更大的愤怒，决不能丝毫动摇中国人民解放台湾的决心！如果美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，我们就一定要把侵略者消灭干净！
    美帝国主义在叫嚣战争的同时，又串同其仆从国家，制造“停火”阴谋，妄图利用联合国的名义，干涉我国内政，割裂我国领土。这种阴谋诡计，中国人民是坚决反对的。我们完全拥护苏联政府二月四日向英国和印度提出的关于召开国际会议，讨论台湾和其他中国沿海岛屿地区危险局势问题的建议，事情十分明白，这一地区的危险局势完全是美国武装侵占台湾，干涉我国内政所造成的，因此，联合国和任何国际会议都只能讨论美国干涉中国内政，侵略中国领土的问题，至于中国人民解放台湾，那完全是中国的内政，联合国和任何国际会议都无权加以干涉。蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民的公敌，它不能代表任何人，它根本没有出席任何国际会议的资格。还有所谓台湾“中立化”，“托管”台湾，以及“两个中国”等等荒谬的说法，都是中国人民所绝对不能接受的。
    孙中山先生从他一生奋斗的经验中，充分认识到要制止帝国主义的侵略，只有向侵略者进行坚决的斗争。一九二四年广州商团事件，孙中山先生并没有被英国的武装干涉所屈服，终于粉碎了当时英帝国主义干涉中国内政的企图。孙中山先生是主张和平的，同时他更认识到只有坚决制止帝国主义的侵略，才能得到真正的和平。今天我们在这里纪念孙中山先生，我们要向全世界再一次宣告：中国人民主张和平，但决不能牺牲国家的领土主权来乞求和平，中国人民反对战争，但决不会被任何战争威胁所吓倒。中国人民完全有力量像解放一江山岛、大陈岛、南麂山岛一样胜利地解放一切沿海岛屿，解放澎湖解放台湾！
    在这里，我要告诉跟随蒋贼逃到台湾的人们，特别是那些曾经追随过孙中山先生的老国民党员，在纪念孙中山先生逝世三十周年的今天，应该忠诚地秉承着孙中山先生的遗教，认清叛徒蒋介石卖国殃民的罪恶，辨明是非，看清大势，响应祖国人民的号召，及早地弃暗投明，回到祖国的怀抱。这是唯一的光明大道！
    同志们！孙中山先生一生为反帝国主义和封建主义而斗争，为争取祖国的独立自由而斗争，在他战斗的一生中，更一直表现着勇于批判自己和不断求进步的特点，在伟大的十月革命影响下和中国共产党的帮助下，他在晚年达到了思想上和政治上的高度的成就，为中国的革命民主派指出了同国际和国内无产阶级运动相联合以争取中国民族独立的正确的道路，他这种思想一直到抗日战争时期和第三次国内革命战争时期仍然对中国革命起着积极的作用，并且成为国民党民主派反对蒋介石国民党反动派的有力武器。我们今天在这里纪念孙中山先生，我要号召中国国民党革命委员会的同志，大家应该效法孙中山先生“不断前进，百折不挠，学而不倦”的革命精神，切实接受中国共产党的领导，认真学习马克思列宁主义，努力改造我们的思想，勤勤恳恳老老实实地做好工作，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，在解放台湾反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，充分发挥我们的作用，贡献我们一切的力量。
    伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生永垂不朽！
