Two Economies, Two Results
		Cheng Guangrui

    Not long ago, the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe successively published communiqués on the implementation of the 1954 national economic plan. From these communiqués, it can be seen that in the past year, the peaceful economy of these countries has achieved brilliant success.

    More than a year ago, the Communist and Workers' Parties and governments of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries put forward new tasks for the development of the national economy: on the basis of continuing to vigorously develop heavy industry, increase the production of agriculture and consumer goods to ensure that light industry obtains the necessary raw materials and that the people have sufficient food and daily necessities. The economic development of these countries in 1954 proves that they have made important achievements in implementing this new task.

    In 1954, the socialist industry of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries continued to grow. Compared with 1953: Poland's total industrial output increased by 11 percent, Czechoslovakia by 4.4 percent, Hungary by 3.1 percent, Romania by 6.6 percent, Bulgaria by 8.7 percent, and Albania by 10.7 percent. Among them, heavy industry, which is the basis for the development of the national economy, such as machinery manufacturing, iron and steel, electricity, and fuel, have all overfulfilled their production plans, and their production volume has greatly exceeded that of 1953.

    The speed of industrial development in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries is strikingly demonstrated by the following fact: Poland, which was far behind the industrially developed countries of Western Europe before the war, has now risen to fifth place in Europe in terms of industrial output, surpassing Italy and almost catching up with France. The continued growth of heavy industry not only guarantees the continuous growth of light industry, the food industry, and agriculture, and the continuous improvement of people's consumption, but also strengthens national defense forces, provides greater security for the peaceful and prosperous life of the people of these countries, and greatly contributes to maintaining the cause of European peace.

    In the past year, dozens of new construction projects have been completed in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Part of the largest construction project in Poland's Six-Year Plan - the Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta - has started construction, and many new factories, coal mines, and power stations have been put into production. In Bulgaria, three newly built hydroelectric power stations and an expanded thermal power station have increased the power generation capacity of power stations by 12.5 percent. These new construction projects have added new impetus to the development of the national economy.

    Due to a series of new measures taken by the state in developing agriculture, including increasing investment in agricultural development, a new upsurge has also generally occurred in agriculture. In 1954, Poland's total agricultural output increased by 4.8 percent compared with 1953, and the sown area of crops expanded by more than 144,500 hectares; Czechoslovakia completed 101 percent of its grain sowing plan; although the climate conditions in Romania last year were not good, grain output was still higher than in 1953, with a total output of more than 9 million tons; Albania's sown area in 1954 expanded by 69.7 percent compared with before the war. The number of machine tractor stations has also increased significantly, and a large number of tractors, various combine harvesters, and other agricultural machines have been obtained in agriculture, and the degree of mechanization in agriculture has been further improved. More farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives. The growth of agricultural production and the further consolidation of the agricultural cooperative system guarantee the supply of industrial raw materials and people's daily necessities.

    On the basis of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the state has repeatedly reduced prices and taken other measures to increase people's welfare, such as expanding residential housing construction, which has further improved the lives of the working people. In 1954, the working people could buy cheaper bread and butter, sweets and pastries, leather shoes and clothing, refrigerators and radios in stores... In 1954, the actual wages of employees in Polish enterprises and institutions increased by about 12 percent compared with 1953, and the actual income of farmers increased by about 11 percent. In Albania, the total volume of housing built in 1954 has increased to nine times that of 1946. The task of housing construction in the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) was completed one year ahead of schedule in 1954, and hundreds of thousands of working people's families moved into well-equipped new homes.

    The people's infinite love for the people's democratic system and their creative labor are the source of the continuous upsurge of the national economy in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. In 1954, 168,000 rationalization proposals and technological innovation proposals were adopted in Polish industry, and 40,000 were adopted in Czechoslovakia. This fully demonstrates the working people's enthusiasm for building socialism.

    The Soviet Union's assistance to the Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the sincere cooperation between the countries of the democratic and socialist camp further guarantees the continuous upsurge of the national economy of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Imperialism has always wanted to strangle the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries with measures such as blockade and "embargo", and their hopes have completely failed. The fact of economic development in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries proves that the conspiracy of any reactionary force cannot stop the wheels of history from moving forward.

    In contrast to the continuously rising economy of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries, the economy of the Western European capitalist countries presents a completely different picture.

    Last year, the industrial production of Western European countries also had some growth. In the first half of last year, the industrial production of countries such as Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy increased by about 7 percent. However, this growth in production in Western European countries is based on the intensified expansion of armaments, and it is fundamentally different from the comprehensive and steady rise of socialist industry in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Therefore, this "growth" is畸形的, unstable, and contains deep crises.

    In recent years, Western European capitalist countries have followed the United States in taking the road of economic militarization, and military expenditures have increased substantially. In 1954, Britain's direct military expenditure was more than twice that of 1949, accounting for nearly two-fifths of its total budget; France almost tripled, consuming more than 30 percent of its budget expenditure; in West Germany, military expenditure accounted for about 40 percent of the total budget. The increase in military expenditure has stimulated the growth of the munitions industry in these countries, which is the basic content of the certain rise in the overall index of industrial production in Western European countries. As for the civilian industrial sector, which constitutes the normal basis of a country's national economy, production is still in a state of stagnation, or even further contraction. In France in 1954, 15 to 20 percent of all industrial production equipment was engaged in military production, while the operating rate of its entire industry only reached 70 percent. Within the past year, dozens of mines have stopped production. Currently, military production accounts for one-sixth of the total industrial production in Britain. However, the situation of British civil industries, such as the textile industry, is deteriorating. According to the "Financial Times", more than 100 factories in Lancashire, the center of the British textile industry, have now reduced production, and many factories have been forced to temporarily stop production. Orders for the British shipbuilding industry have also decreased sharply, and the production of many light industries has been stagnant for a long time. Production in West Germany's food industry and textile industry has also been cut. Isn't it obvious that the intensified expansion of armaments has not been able to solve the crisis of the capitalist economy in Western European countries, but only reflects the weakness and decay of their economy?

    Agriculture in Western European countries is also fraught with crises and heading for decline. In France, for the past two years, due to the low purchasing power of urban residents, it has been difficult to sell and there has been a surplus of agricultural products, resulting in a sharp drop in prices. In Italy, the output of wheat and rye has fallen from 9.17 million tons in 1953 to 7.86 million tons in 1954.

    Indeed, the intensified expansion of armaments has enabled a small number of monopoly capitalists in Western European countries to make a fortune. For example, the profits of 3,000 British companies in the ten months of 1954 increased by 8.7 percent compared with the same period in 1953, while the profits of companies manufacturing military orders increased by a quarter to a third.

    But on the other hand, the lives of the vast working people in Western European countries have become more impoverished. In 1954, the retail price index in the United Kingdom reached the highest level since the index was created, with food prices increasing by 8 percent, but wages did not receive even a corresponding increase. The actual wages of French workers are almost 50 percent lower than before the war. The vast working people are also suffering from unemployment. The number of fully unemployed and underemployed in Italy is estimated to be nearly 4.5 million, while the number of fully unemployed in West Germany is also nearly 1 million. In order to oppose the expansion of armaments and oppose the attacks of monopoly capitalists, the working people in Western European countries launched countless strikes in 1954.

    The economies of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the Western European capitalist countries are developed according to two completely different economic laws - the basic economic law of socialism and the basic economic law of capitalism - the former requires maximizing the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the broad masses of the people, and the latter requires satisfying the maximum profits of a small number of monopoly capitalists. Therefore, they are bound to produce two different results.

    The comparison of the economic situations of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the Western European capitalist countries in 1954 once again proves the superiority of the people's democracy and the socialist system. Capitalism attempts to find a way out of the crisis from the expansion of armaments and economic militarization, but the result can only further destroy the national economy and deepen the nature of the crisis; at the same time, it drags its own country onto the road of war, causing great disasters to the vast working people for the profits of a small number of people. Therefore, the people of Western European countries are increasingly rising up to fight against arming West Germany and defending peace. The brilliant achievements of the peaceful labor of the working people in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries in the past year have not only further strengthened the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, but also will play a huge role in inspiring the struggle of the people in Western Europe.

    两种经济，两个结果
    程光锐
    不久以前，东欧人民民主国家相继发表了一九五四年国民经济计划执行情况的公报。从这些公报中可以看出，在过去一年中，这些国家的和平经济又获得了光辉的成就。
    一年多以前，东欧人民民主国家的共产党、工人党和政府提出发展国民经济的新任务：在继续大力发展重工业的基础上，增加农业和消费品的生产，以保证轻工业获得必需的原料，保证人民有充足的粮食和日用品。一九五四年这些国家的经济发展情况证明，它们在执行这个新任务方面取得了重要的成绩。
    一九五四年东欧人民民主国家的社会主义工业继续增长。和一九五三年比较：波兰工业总产量增加了百分之十一，捷克斯洛伐克增加了百分之四点四，匈牙利增加了百分之三点一，罗马尼亚增加了百分之六点六，保加利亚增加了百分之八点七，阿尔巴尼亚增加了百分之十点七。其中，特别是作为国民经济发展基础的重工业，像机器制造、钢铁、电力、燃料等工业都超额完成了生产计划，它们的生产量都大大超过了一九五三年的生产量。
    东欧人民民主国家工业发展的速度，从下面这个事实突出地表现出来：战前远远落后于西欧工业发达国家的波兰，就它的工业生产量来说，目前在欧洲已上升到第五位，超过了意大利，而且差不多赶上了法国。重工业的继续增长，不仅保证了轻工业、食品工业以及农业的不断增长，保证了人民消费的不断提高；而且增强了国防力量，为这些国家的人民的和平繁荣的生活提供了更大的安全保障，并大大有助于维护欧洲和平的事业。
    在过去的一年里，东欧人民民主国家中又完成了几十个新的建设工程。波兰六年计划中最大的建设工程——诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金联合企业的一部分开工了，还有许多新的工厂，煤矿和电力站投入了生产。在保加利亚，新建的三个水力发电站和一个扩建的电热站使发电站的发电能力提高了百分之十二点五。这些新建工程给国民经济的发展增加了新的动力。
    由于国家在发展农业方面采取了一系列新的措施，包括增加发展农业方面的投资，在农业方面也普遍出现了新的高涨。一九五四年，波兰农业总生产量比一九五三年增加了百分之四点八，农作物播种面积扩大了十四万四千五百多公顷；捷克斯洛伐克的谷物播种计划完成了百分之一百零一；罗马尼亚虽然去年气候条件不好，但是谷物产量仍旧高于一九五三年，总产量达到了九百多万吨；阿尔巴尼亚一九五四年的播种面积比战前扩大了百分之六十九点七。机器拖拉机站的数目也有显著的增加，农业中又获得了大批的拖拉机、各种联合机和其他农业机器，农业中的机械化程度进一步提高了。又有更多的农民加入了农业生产合作社。农业生产的增长，农业合作社制度的进一步巩固，保证了工业原料和人民生活必需品的供给。
    在工农业生产迅速发展的基础上，国家屡次减低了物价，并采取扩建居民住宅等等其他增加人民福利的措施，使得劳动人民的生活获得了进一步的改善。一九五四年，劳动人民在商店中可以买到更加便宜的面包和牛油，糖果和点心，皮鞋和服装，冰箱和收音机……。一九五四年波兰的企业和机关工作人员的实际工资约比一九五三年增加了百分之十二，农民的实际收入约增加了百分之十一。在阿尔巴尼亚，一九五四年建筑的住宅总体积已经增加为一九四六年的九倍，五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）关于住宅建筑的任务已在一九五四年提前一年完成，成千成万的劳动人民的家庭迁进了设备完善的新居。
    人民对于人民民主制度的无限的热爱和创造性的劳动，是东欧人民民主国家国民经济不断高涨的源泉。一九五四年，在波兰工业中采用的合理化建议和技术革新建议达到十六万八千件，在捷克斯洛伐克达到了四万件。这充分表现了劳动人民的建设社会主义的热情。
    苏联对东欧人民民主国家的援助以及民主和社会主义阵营国家之间的真诚合作，更加保证了东欧人民民主国家国民经济的不断高涨。帝国主义一直想用封锁、“禁运”等办法来扼杀苏联和人民民主国家，它们的希望完全落空了。东欧人民民主国家经济发展的事实证明，任何反动势力的阴谋都阻挡不住历史的车轮往前进展。
    和不断高涨的东欧人民民主国家的经济对照，西欧资本主义国家的经济呈现的是完全另一种图景。
    去年西欧各国的工业生产也有了某些增长，英、法、西德、意大利等国家去年上半年工业生产量大约增加了百分之七。但是，西欧国家生产的这种增长是建立在加紧扩充军备的基础上的，它和东欧人民民主国家社会主义工业的全面的稳步高涨有着根本性质的不同。因此，这种“增长”是畸形的、不稳定的，内部包藏着深刻的危机。
    近年来，西欧资本主义国家追随美国走经济军事化的道路，军费的开支大量增加。一九五四年英国的直接军费开支为一九四九年开支的两倍多，占它总预算的将近五分之二；法国则几乎增加到了三倍，消耗它预算开支的百分之三十以上；在西德，军费占了预算总额的约百分之四十。军费的增长刺激了这些国家军火工业的增长，这就是西欧国家工业生产的总指数有某些上升的基本内容。至于构成一国国民经济的正常基础的民用工业部门，生产仍然处在停滞的状态中，甚至进一步萎缩了。法国一九五四年全部工业生产设备的百分之十五至二十是从事军事生产的，而它全部工业的开工率只达到百分之七十，去年一年内，就有几十座矿井停止了生产。目前英国全部工业生产中军事生产品占六分之一。而英国的民用工业，像纺织工业却处境恶化，据“金融时报”报道，在英国纺织工业中心兰开夏现在已有一百多个工厂缩减了生产，还有许多工厂被迫暂时停止生产。英国造船业的定货也急剧减少，许多轻工业生产长期停滞。西德的食品工业和纺织工业的生产也都削减了。加紧扩充军备并没有能够解决西欧各国资本主义经济的危机，只是反映它们经济的虚弱和腐朽，这不是很明显吗？
    西欧国家的农业也潜伏着危机和走向衰落。在法国，两年来由于城市居民的购买力低落而造成了农产品销售困难和过剩，以致售价猛跌。而在意大利，小麦和稞麦的产量已从一九五三年的九百十七万吨下降到一九五四年的七百八十六万吨。
    的确，加紧扩充军备使西欧各国一小撮垄断资本家大发横财。例如英国三千家公司一九五四年十个月的利润比一九五三年同一期间的利润增加了百分之八点七，而制造军事订货的公司的利润更是增加了四分之一到三分之一。
    但是另一面，西欧各国广大劳动人民的生活却更加贫困了。一九五四年，英国零售价格的指数达到了自有这个指数以来的最高水平，其中食品价格增加了百分之八，但是工资并没有得到即使是相应的提高。法国职工的实际工资几乎比战前减少了百分之五十。广大的劳动人民还深受失业的痛苦。意大利的完全失业者和半失业者的数目估计近四百五十万名，而西德的完全失业者也近一百万名。为了反对扩充军备和反对垄断资本家的进攻，西欧各国劳动人民在一九五四年进行了无数次的罢工斗争。
    东欧人民民主国家和西欧资本主义国家的经济是按照两种截然不同的经济法则——社会主义基本经济法则和资本主义基本经济法则——而发展的，前者要求最大限度地满足广大人民日益增长的物质和文化的需要，后者要求满足一小撮垄断资本家的最大限度的利润。因此，它们就必然产生两种不同的结果。
    一九五四年东欧人民民主国家和西欧资本主义国家经济情况的对比，再一次证明人民民主和社会主义制度的优越性。资本主义企图从扩充军备和经济军事化中间寻找解脱危机的出路，结果只能使国民经济遭到进一步的破坏，加深危机的性质；同时把自己的国家拖到战争的道路上去，为了一小撮人的利润而使广大的劳动人民蒙受巨大的灾祸。因此，西欧各国人民越来越多地起来为反对武装西德和保卫和平而斗争。东欧人民民主国家劳动人民过去一年中和平劳动的光辉成就，不仅进一步壮大了和平、民主和社会主义阵营，而且将对西欧人民的斗争起巨大的鼓舞作用。
