Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 22nd: Jiangsu Province is expanding the planting area for improved varieties of grain crops and cotton. The planting area for improved grain crop varieties this year will expand to more than 22 million mu, an increase of more than 6 million mu compared to last year. More than 95% of this will be promoted and planted by mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Currently, more than 80 million jin of improved grain crop seeds held by agricultural and forestry departments are being rapidly transferred to rural areas. These seeds include more than 30 varieties of rice, miscellaneous grains, etc., most of which were selected and bred in rural areas within the province, while some were introduced from other provinces. The "Nante No. 1" improved rice variety, introduced from Jiangxi Province in 1951, has proven to be early-maturing, fertilizer-resistant, lodging-resistant, and highly resistant to diseases and insect pests in the Xinghua County area, with an average yield per mu 20% to 40% higher than local general rice varieties. This year, it is planned to expand the planting area of "Nante No. 1" rice from 700,000 mu last year to 1.5 million mu in the Lixiahe area. The "Laolaiqing" late-season rice variety, bred by Chen Yongkang, a national rice production model, will be planted on 260,000 mu in Songjiang Prefecture this year. In addition, two new rice varieties, "Zhongjing 412" and "Wanjing 813," will be trial-planted by mutual aid and cooperation organizations on 220,000 mu.
    The planting area for improved cotton varieties this year will expand to 9 million mu, 2.7 million mu more than last year. All of the 770,000 dan of "Dai Zi No. 15" and "Si Zi Er Bi" excellent cotton seeds needed have been transported to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions. About half of the "Dai Zi No. 15" cotton seeds of the Tidong District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Dafeng County have been supplied to farmers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 22nd: Farmers in Hubei Province are preparing to greatly expand the planting area of improved varieties such as Shengli Xian rice, Nandai 2419 wheat, and Dai Zi cotton this year. According to the plan, the planting area of these improved varieties will increase from 6.65 million mu in 1953 to more than 14 million mu (accounting for 15.2% of the province's total sown area for grain and cotton). This is an important guarantee for achieving the province's goal of increasing grain production by 1 billion jin and ginned cotton by 150,000 dan this year.
    According to the planting results of Hubei Province farmers over the past few years, wherever these improved varieties are planted and corresponding cultivation techniques are adopted under the same cultivation conditions, yields have increased by 10% to 30% compared to local general varieties, with the highest reaching 50%.
    Currently, agricultural production cooperatives along the Yangtze and Han Rivers and in the Jianghan Plain area have begun to turn over and select seeds. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are also preparing to lead the surrounding farmers to carefully select each grain and use warm water soaking and chemical seed dressing. Farmers in areas that suffered from major floods last year, in addition to receiving a large amount of improved seeds from neighboring farmers, also received more than 20 million jin of Shengli Xian rice and Dai Zi cotton seeds supplied by the state, as well as more than 4,000 thermometers and hydrometers and more than 23,000 jin of chemical powders for warm water soaking and chemical seed dressing.

    江苏湖北两省扩大粮棉优良品种种植面积
    【新华社南京二十二日电】江苏省扩大粮食作物和棉花的良种种植面积。粮食作物良种种植面积今年将扩大到两千二百多万亩，比去年增加六百多万亩。其中百分之九十五以上是由互助合作组织来推广种植。现在农林部门掌握的八千多万斤粮食作物良种正在向农村加速调运。这些良种包括水稻、杂粮等三十多个品种，绝大部分是在省内农村选育出来的，也有的是从省外介绍来的。一九五一年从江西省介绍来的“南特号”水稻良种，在兴化县一带种植，证明具有早熟、耐肥、不倒伏、抗病虫害能力强等优点，每亩平均产量高出当地一般稻种百分之二十到四十。今年计划在里下河地区一带，把“南特号”水稻的种植面积，由去年的七十万亩扩大到一百五十万亩。全国水稻丰产模范陈永康选育的“老来青”晚稻种，今年将在松江专区栽种二十六万亩。还有两个新的水稻品种“中粳四一二”“晚粳八一三”，由互助合作组织试种二十二万亩。
    棉花良种种植面积今年将扩大到九百万亩，比去年多二百七十万亩。所需要的七十七万多担“岱字十五号”和“斯字二比”优良棉种已全部运到各地基层供销合作社。大丰县堤东区供销合作社的“岱字十五号”棉种，已约有一半供应到农民手里。
    【新华社武汉二十二日电】湖北省农民今年准备大量推广胜利秈水稻、南大二四一九小麦和岱字棉花等优良品种的种植面积。按照计划规定，这些良种的种植面积将由一九五三年的六百六十五万亩增加到一千四百多万亩（占全省粮食和棉花播种总面积的百分之十五点二），这是实现全省今年增产粮食十亿斤和皮棉十五万担的一项重要保证。
    根据湖北省农民几年的种植结果证明：在同样耕作条件下，凡是种植这些优良品种并采取相应的栽培技术的地方，都比当地一般品种增产一成到三成，最高的达五成。
    目前，长江、汉水两岸和江汉平原地区的农业生产合作社已经动手翻晒和挑选种籽。不少农业生产合作社和互助组还准备带动周围的农民粒粒精选，并用温汤浸种、药剂拌种。去年遭受大水地区农民，除了得到邻近农民支援的大批优良种籽外，国家还供应了两千多万斤胜利秈水稻和岱字棉种籽，另外还供给农民温汤浸种、药剂拌种用的温度计、比重计四千多支和药粉两万三千多斤。
