Wuhan has begun carrying out lecture work to promote materialist thought and criticize bourgeois idealist thought among cadres and intellectuals. Li Erzhong, Third Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, gave the first lecture, entitled "Why Criticize Bourgeois Idealist Thought? Why Study the Materialist Worldview?" in Hankou on March 19. More than 1,800 people attended.

Currently, the Wuhan area is temporarily holding three lecture series. The Wuchang lecture series is sponsored by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee; the Hankou lecture series is sponsored by the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee; and the college and university lecture series is sponsored by the Wuhan Municipal Higher Education Committee. These lectures are scheduled to be held once a month. This year, it is planned to reach 40,000 attendees (20% of cadres and intellectuals in the Wuhan area with at least a junior high school education). More lecture series will be added later. To make the lecture work more regular, the Wuhan area has begun to prepare for the establishment of a lecture group composed of academic and literary workers, both within and outside the Party, as well as some leading cadres. The group will be divided into research groups based on their professional nature, such as philosophy, literature and art, history, and natural sciences. Each research group will periodically undertake certain research and lecture work.

    武汉开展唯物主义宣传工作
    在干部和知识分子中，宣传唯物主义思想，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想的演讲工作，武汉地区已开始进行。由武汉市委第三书记李尔重担任第一次演讲会的演讲，三月十九日在汉口举办，讲题是“为什么要批评资产阶级唯心主义思想？为什么要学习唯物主义世界观？”到会听讲的有一千八百多人。
    武汉地区的演讲工作目前暂举办三个讲座。武昌的讲座由中共湖北省委主办；汉口的讲座由中共武汉市委主办；大专学校的讲座由中共武汉市高等学校委员会主办。这一演讲工作，规定每月举办一次。今年计划达到听众四万人次（占武汉地区初中以上文化程度的干部、知识分子的百分之二十）。以后陆续增加讲座。为使演讲工作经常化，武汉地区已着手准备成立由党内外的学术工作者和文艺工作者以及部分领导干部组成的演讲团。团内按业务性质成立哲学、文艺、史学和自然科学等研究组。每个研究组定期分担一定的研究工作和演讲工作。
