Xinhua News Agency, March 9th, TASS, Paris, March 8th: The French National Peace Council issued a statement saying that many French public organizations, trade unions, and political organizations, including the French Veterans Alliance with three million members, the National Federation of Reserve Officers, the League of Human Rights, the French Women's League, the General Confederation of Labor, the French Republican Youth League, the National Committee for Farmers' Defense of Peace and Agriculture, etc., have formally opposed the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

The scale of the movement against the revival of German militarism has influenced many senators in the Senate of the Republic who earlier tended to vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreements. According to "l'Humanité," five senators from the Seine department in the Senate of the Republic have already announced that they will vote against ratification, and the attitude of another four senators has not yet been confirmed.

None of the three senators from the Saône-et-Loire department in the Senate of the Republic (all Radical Socialists) dared to announce that they would support the Paris Agreements in the upcoming debate in the Senate. "Les Échos," in assessing the current situation, wrote that the debate in the Senate of the Republic "may be more tense than people originally anticipated."

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th, TASS, Paris, March 6th: More than fifty prominent political and social activists in France issued a statement calling on all members of the Senate of the Republic to reject the Paris Agreements. The statement said, "The danger posed by the revival of the Wehrmacht to our country and the world must be eliminated... We solemnly call on the Senate of the Republic to declare that France opposes the arming of Germany—this was confirmed when the National Assembly rejected the plan to revive the Wehrmacht on December 24th."

Signatories to the statement included former ministers Paul Bastid and Justin Godart, Generals Korgi and Dubé, Admiral Moulec, a member of the French Federal Council, Didier, President of the Investigating Chamber of the Paris Court, Sicard de Plauzoles, Honorary President of the League of Human Rights, writers Vercors, Abalin, Benda, and professors at the University of Paris, Maurice Genevoix and Piot Louivigny, among others.

According to "l'Humanité," several members of the Senate of the Republic have indicated to delegations of working people that they intend to vote against the ratification of the Paris Agreements in the upcoming debate.

Robert Kijon, a member of the Senate of the Republic and a Radical Party member who voted against the "European Defense Community," said: "I oppose the London and Paris Agreements and advocate negotiations with the East on resolving the German question."

Frank-Chatel and Bordeigneuf, members of the Senate of the Republic and Radical Party members, also issued similar statements.

    法国许多公众组织反对批准巴黎协定
    五十多位著名社会活动家要求参议院议员否决巴黎协定
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社巴黎八日讯：法国全国和平理事会发表一个声明说，法国许多公众组织、工会和政治组织，包括有三百万盟员的法兰西退伍军人联盟、后备军官全国联合会、人权联盟、法兰西妇女联盟、总工会、法兰西共和青年联盟、农民保卫和平与农业全国委员会等，都正式反对批准巴黎协定。
    反对复活德国军国主义的运动的规模已经影响了共和国参议院中许多早些时倾向于投票赞成批准巴黎协定的参议员。据“人道报”报道，共和国参议院的塞纳省参议员中已有五人宣布，他们要投票反对批准，另外四个参议员的态度尚未肯定。
    共和国参议院索恩和罗亚尔省的三个参议员（全部是激进社会党人）没有一个人敢于宣布要在参议院即将举行的辩论中支持巴黎协定。“回声报”在估计目前的局势时写道，共和国参议院的辩论“可能比人们原来预料的要紧张”。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：法国五十多位著名的政治和社会活动家发表声明，号召共和国参议院全体议员否决巴黎协定。声明说，“必须消除复活国防军对我国和全世界所造成的危险……我们庄严地号召共和国参议院声明，法国反对武装德国——这是在十二月二十四日国民议会否决复活国防军计划的时候就被证实了的。”
    在声明上签字的有前部长保罗·巴斯迪和儒斯丹·戈达，科尔吉将军和杜贝将军，法兰西联邦议会议员穆莱克海军上将，巴黎法院侦察庭庭长迪第埃，人权联盟荣誉主席西卡·德普洛桑尔，作家维尔高尔、阿拜林、本达，巴黎大学教授莫里斯·让科利希和彼奥特·路易维尼等人。
    据“人道报”报道，共和国参议院的若干议员向劳动人民代表团表明他们打算在即将举行的辩论中投票反对批准巴黎协定。
    曾投票反对“欧洲防务集团”的共和国参议院议员、激进党人罗伯·基戎说：“我反对伦敦和巴黎协定，并且主张同东方举行关于解决德国问题的谈判。”
    共和国参议院议员、激进党人弗兰克—夏特和波尔德涅夫也发表了类似的声明。
