Dear sisters! Esteemed guests!

On this great "March 8th" International Women's Day, please allow me, on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, to extend warm congratulations to our sisters in the capital and across the nation! To salute the Soviet women who are victoriously building communism! To salute the women of the people's democratic countries who are victoriously building socialism! To salute the Korean women who are rebuilding their homeland and striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea! To salute the Vietnamese women who are fighting to consolidate peace and achieve national unity, independence, and democracy! To salute the women of all countries who are fighting for peace and democracy!

As we celebrate "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, we are very pleased to see that our motherland has taken a giant step towards socialism in the past year. Our country's first Five-Year Plan has entered its third year, and last year's construction plan has been successfully completed; our country's people's democratic system has been further consolidated; our country's national defense strength has also been greatly enhanced; the material and cultural life of our people has been further improved; and our country's role and influence in international affairs has been increasing and expanding. Internationally, thanks to the joint efforts of peace-loving people around the world, following the Korean armistice, a major victory was achieved in restoring peace in Indochina. The Five Principles for relations between the two countries, reaffirmed by the Prime Ministers of China and India in their joint statement, have won universal support from peace-loving people in Asia and around the world. The decision to convene the Asian-African Conference reflects the increasingly strong desire of Asian and African countries to take their destiny into their own hands and to cooperate amicably with other countries in the world on an equal footing. In Europe, following the defeat of the "European Defense Community," the struggle of the people of Europe against the Paris Agreement and against the rearmament of West Germany is unfolding vigorously. The international peace front is constantly expanding and becoming increasingly consolidated. The successful testing of the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station, and the Soviet Union's decision to help other countries develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes, have given tremendous encouragement to the world's peace forces. In order to defeat the US aggressive bloc's conspiracy to launch an atomic war, people of all countries are launching a large-scale signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. All this fills us with great excitement as we greet our own festival.

Dear sisters! While our country has achieved great success, we have seen that women across the country are playing a huge role, just as men are, in the country's economic construction and political life, and that the status and material and cultural life of women themselves are also improving and progressing day by day. The patriotism and socialist consciousness of our women has been greatly enhanced.

Women have realized that completing the national plan is to lead the country to a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, female workers are actively learning to master technology and advanced Soviet experience, finding tricks and tapping potential, and constantly improving labor productivity and saving raw materials in order to complete and overfulfill production plans. As a result, many female labor models and advanced workers have emerged in various factories, mines and enterprises. For example, among the 105 national textile industry labor models, 53 are women. Among the more than 3,700 advanced workers in Shanghai's textile industry, more than 2,100 are women. Because female workers possess advanced socialist ideas and have mastered modern technology, they have cultivated the conditions for themselves to take on leadership positions. Many outstanding female workers have been promoted to serve as factory directors or deputy factory directors, workshop directors, etc. In the national machinery industry, female factory directors account for 4.17 percent of the total number of factory directors. The number of women serving as engineers, drivers, and in various industrial departments is also increasing, and they are contributing their labor and wisdom to the socialist industrialization of the motherland in their respective positions. Many family members of workers have also organized themselves to make significant contributions under the slogan of uniting and helping each other, doing a good job in housework, increasing the attendance rate of workers, and improving the health of workers, in order to ensure that workers do a good job in production and complete the national plan.

In the national movement to increase agricultural production and promote mutual aid and cooperation, rural women have also become an important force. Women have realized the close relationship between participating in social production and the cooperativization and collectivization of agriculture and the thorough emancipation of women, and they are increasingly enthusiastically participating in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In our vast rural areas, women participating in agricultural production account for 60 to 80 percent of the total number of rural working women. The number of agricultural production cooperatives across the country has grown to more than 580,000. In these agricultural production cooperatives, the number of workdays contributed by women is increasing year by year, generally accounting for about 30 percent of the total number of workdays. In better cooperatives, such as the Xizhanggeng Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, in 1954, the workdays contributed by female members accounted for more than 40 percent of the total number of workdays in the cooperative, becoming an important factor in the cooperative's bumper harvests of cotton and wheat last year. In the process of establishing and consolidating cooperatives, and in learning and promoting new farming techniques and advanced Soviet experience, a large number of female activists, female technicians, female accountants, and various production leaders have emerged and been trained. In the autumn of 1954 alone, among the 7,141 cooperatives in Shanxi Province, there were 5,247 female heads and deputy heads, and a total of 11,700 female committee members, production team leaders, and production group leaders.

In the cultural arts, science and education, medical and health, finance and trade departments, and in state organs and people's organizations, more and more women are participating in work. Women account for 17 percent of the professors and lecturers in national universities, and female presidents account for about 12 percent of the presidents in courts at all levels; female staff account for 16.6 percent of bank staff. Among them, there have also emerged many model workers and advanced figures. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the vast number of housewives across the country have also made varying degrees of contributions to consolidating the armed forces, strengthening national defense, implementing the policies of planned supply and planned procurement, purchasing public bonds, preventing floods and providing disaster relief, and educating children. All this shows the rapid rise in the patriotic and socialist consciousness of women in various positions and in the vast families.

The convening of the National People's Congress and the adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China are the most significant events in our country's political life. They vividly demonstrate the contribution and status of women in the country's political life. Among the 1,226 representatives to the National People's Congress, there are 147 women, accounting for 12 percent of the total number of representatives. They are the most outstanding representatives of labor models in industry and agriculture and advanced workers in various positions. At the grassroots level, there are more than 980,000 female people's representatives. This shows how much trust and honor the state and the people give to women. Women, together with the people of the whole country, participated in the discussion of the draft constitution with great enthusiasm, a sense of ownership, and a responsible spirit, and formulated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The constitution stipulates the socialist path for our country to prosperity and happiness, and specifically stipulates that men and women have equal rights and that marriage, family, motherhood, and children are protected by the state. All this heralds the complete emancipation of Chinese women and an infinitely bright future, which of course greatly encourages the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of women, enabling them to further unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and strive to participate in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. The state's close concern for women and children, the development of maternal and child health care, and the increase in welfare facilities, create even more favorable conditions for women to participate in social production and work.

Dear sisters! We deeply feel how beautiful our motherland is, how superior our social system is, and how bright our future is! To be able to participate in such a magnificent cause—building our beloved motherland into a great socialist country—is truly our greatest happiness and highest honor!

Our country has appeared on the international stage as a world power, becoming an important factor in the peace and security of the Asian and Pacific region. Our country, together with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, has become a strong bulwark for defending world peace. Chinese women are an important force in the international women's movement for peace and democracy. Our friendship and unity with women of all countries has greatly developed over the past year. Last year alone, during the National Day celebration, our All-China Democratic Women's Federation invited 71 international friends from 17 countries to visit China. After a period of friendly association, our mutual understanding has been further enhanced, and our friendship has become closer. Foreign friends have been deeply impressed by our sincere desire for peace and friendship with the people of all countries. In the meantime, we also deeply feel that the visits of our friends are a kind of supervision and encouragement for our work. In the future, we will welcome more foreign friends to China. Last year, we were also invited to send delegations to visit Korea, Romania, Britain, and France. These visits have helped to increase our mutual understanding and friendship. We have learned a lot from our foreign friends. The hopes, confidence, and friendship of our foreign friends have made us feel the importance of our responsibilities and the preciousness of peace, and have made us even more determined to work with all peace-loving people in the world to take on the lofty cause of defending peace and to fight for it to the end!

Dear sisters! As we celebrate "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, we rejoice in the many gratifying achievements of our motherland, and at the same time we face the serious tasks of building our motherland and defending peace. This year is a year of decisive significance for the construction of our country's first Five-Year Plan. The task of industrial construction is particularly heavy, and agriculture must strive for greater production increases, and we must also consolidate the newly established hundreds of thousands of production cooperatives. US imperialism forcibly occupies our territory of Taiwan, interferes in China's internal affairs, openly carries out war provocations against our country, and clamors to interfere by force in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, attempting to expand its aggression against our country, creating a new tense situation in Asia, and seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. Under such circumstances, we cannot but increase our tasks of liberating Taiwan, defending the motherland, resisting aggression, and defending peace.

In order to victoriously complete the great and arduous tasks of building a socialist motherland and liberating Taiwan and defending world peace, women across the country must unite more closely, further raise their patriotism and socialist consciousness, carry forward the glorious tradition of loving the motherland, firmly establish the idea of loving socialism, recognize the unity of individual, family, collective, and national interests, and recognize that building and defending the socialist motherland is our highest interest. In factories, we must strive to increase production and practice economy, learn to master new technologies, continuously improve labor productivity, and complete and overfulfill national plans; in rural areas, we must strive to develop agricultural production and actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations; in various positions, we must love our work and work selflessly. All women must maintain and improve their vigilance against the enemy, resolutely implement national policies and laws, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship; strive to improve their cultural and scientific knowledge; manage their families diligently, educate their children with a socialist spirit, and handle family relations with socialist moral principles, and strive in all aspects to build a socialist motherland and support the liberation of Taiwan.

Now the people of the whole country, together with the people of all countries in the world, are enthusiastically responding to the call of the World Peace Council and launching a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. This movement expresses the righteous condemnation of the atomic maniacs who are preparing to launch an atomic war, and the firm determination to oppose the use of atomic weapons and stop the evil conspiracies of the American warmongers. Women in all cities and villages, in all classes, and in all fields across the country must actively participate in the signing to show our will and strength to defend peace, defend labor, defend families, defend children, defend the motherland, and defend peace. At the same time, we must strengthen our friendly cooperation with Soviet women, with women of the people's democratic countries, and with peace-loving women around the world, and gather the world's peace-loving forces against war into an irresistible torrent. We must warn the US aggressive bloc: If they dare to launch a war of aggression, they will surely be completely submerged in the irresistible torrent formed by the people of the world.

The International Democratic Women's Federation has called for a World Mothers' Congress in Defense of Peace and in Defense of Children to be held in July this year. We Chinese women must enthusiastically respond to the call and actively prepare for and participate in this conference. We Chinese mothers must closely join hands with mothers from all countries in the world to fight for the defense of peace and for the beautiful future of our children.

Sisters! Let us unite and fight to the end for the construction of the motherland, the defense of the motherland, and the defense of peace!

Long live "March 8th" International Women's Day!
Long live the great unity of Chinese women!
Long live the great unity of women of the world!
Long live world peace!

    在首都各界妇女纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴的讲话亲爱的姊妹们！来宾们！
    在这伟大的“三八”国际妇女节，请让我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会，向首都和全国的姊妹们致以热烈的祝贺！向胜利地建设着共产主义的苏联妇女致敬！向胜利地建设着社会主义的各人民民主国家的妇女致敬！向正在重建祖国、为和平统一朝鲜而奋斗的朝鲜妇女致敬！向为巩固和平，实现全国统一、独立和民主而斗争的越南妇女致敬！向世界各国为和平、民主而斗争的妇女致敬！
    今年庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的时候，我们很高兴地看到：一年来我们祖国向社会主义迈进了一大步。我国第一个五年计划今年已进入第三个年头，去年度的建设计划已经胜利完成；我国人民民主制度更加巩固了；我国的国防力量也大大增强了；我国人民的物质文化生活得到了进一步的改善；我国在国际事务中所起的作用和影响日益加强和扩大。在国际方面，由于全世界爱好和平的人民的共同努力，继朝鲜停战之后，又获得了恢复印度支那和平的重大胜利。中印两国总理在联合声明中重申的关于两国关系的五项原则赢得了亚洲和世界各国爱好和平人民的普遍支持。亚非会议的决定召开反映了亚非各国要把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里，并以平等的地位同世界上其他国家友好合作的日益坚强的愿望。在欧洲，继“欧洲防务集团”的挫败之后，全欧人民反对巴黎协定，反对重新武装西德的斗争正在风起云涌地展开。国际的和平阵线正在不断扩大和日益巩固。苏联第一个原子能工业发电站的试验成功，和苏联帮助其他国家发展原子能用于和平用途的研究的决定，给了世界和平力量以莫大的鼓舞，为了击破美国侵略集团发动原子战争的阴谋，各国人民正在掀起世界规模的声势浩大的反对使用原子武器签名运动。这一切，使我们在迎接自己的节日时感到极大的振奋。
    亲爱的姊妹们！我们国家获得巨大成就的同时，我们已经看到全国妇女在祖国的经济建设和政治生活中正在与男子一样发挥着巨大的作用，妇女本身的地位和物质、文化生活也日益提高和改善了。我们妇女们的爱国主义与社会主义觉悟已经大大提高了。
    妇女们认识到：完成国家计划就是把国家引向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。因此，女工们正在积极学习掌握技术和苏联先进经验，找窍门、挖潜力，不断提高劳动生产率和节约原材料来争取完成和超额完成生产计划，从而在各种厂、矿企业部门涌现了许多女劳动模范和先进工作者。如全国纺织工业劳动模范一百零五人中，女工就有五十三人。上海纺织工业三千七百多个先进工作者中，妇女就有二千一百多人。由于女工们具备了先进的社会主义思想和掌握了现代化的技术，就为自己培植了走上领导岗位的条件。许多优秀的女工已被提拔担任了正副厂长、车间主任等，在全国机械工业中，女厂长已占厂长总数的百分之四点一七。妇女担任工程师、驾驶员和各种工业部门中的工作的也日渐多起来了，她们在各自不同的岗位上为祖国的社会主义工业化贡献着自己的劳动与智慧。许多职工家属也都纷纷组织起来，在团结互助，搞好家务，提高职工出勤率，增进职工健康，以保证职工搞好生产，完成国家计划的口号下，用具体行动作出了重大的贡献。
    在全国农业增产、互助合作的运动中，农村妇女也成为一支重要的力量。妇女们认识到参加社会生产劳动和农业的合作化、集体化与妇女彻底解放的切身关系，日益踊跃地参加农业生产与互助合作运动。在我国广大的农村中，参加农业生产的妇女已占农村劳动妇女总数的百分之六十到八十。全国的农业生产合作社已发展到五十八万多个。在这些农业生产合作社中，妇女所作劳动日逐年增加，一般的占劳动日总数百分之三十左右，较好的如山西解虞县西张耿村农业生产合作社，一九五四年女社员所作劳动日占全社劳动日总数百分之四十还多，成为该社去年棉花、麦子大丰产的重要因素。在建立和巩固合作社的过程中，在学习和推广新耕作技术和苏联先进经验中，涌现和培养了大量的女积极分子、女技术员、女会计和各种生产领导者。在一九五四年秋季，仅山西省的七千一百四十一个社中就有女正副社长五千二百四十七人，女社务委员、生产队长、生产组长共一万一千七百人。
    在文化艺术、科学教育、医务卫生、财经贸易各部门和国家机关与人民团体中，妇女参加工作的也越来越多，全国高等学校的教授、讲师中，妇女占百分之十七，各级法院中，女院长约占百分之十二；银行职员中，女职员占百分之十六点六。在她们中间，同样也出现了许多模范工作者与先进人物。全国的烈军属和广大家庭妇女，对于巩固部队、加强国防、贯彻计划供应与计划收购政策、认购公债、防汛救灾以及教育子女各方面也都有着不同程度的贡献。这一切都说明了在各种工作岗位上和广大家庭中，妇女的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟迅速高涨的情况。
    全国人民代表大会会议的召开和中华人民共和国宪法的通过，是我国政治生活中最重大的事件。在这里生动地证明了妇女在国家政治生活中的贡献和地位。全国人民代表大会的一千二百二十六名代表中，有一百四十七名妇女，占代表总数的百分之十二。她们是工农业劳动模范和各种工作岗位上先进工作者的最优秀的代表。在基层中，有九十八万多名女人民代表。这就可以看出，国家和人民给予妇女多大的信任和荣誉。妇女们曾和全国人民一起，以巨大的热情、主人翁的态度和负责的精神参加了宪法草案的讨论，制订了中华人民共和国宪法。宪法规定了使我国走向繁荣幸福的社会主义道路，并特别规定了男女权利平等和婚姻、家庭、母性和儿童受国家的保护。这一切都预示着中国妇女的彻底解放和无限美好的将来，当然也就大大鼓舞了广大妇女的政治热情和生产的积极性，使她们更进一步地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，努力参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。而国家给予妇女儿童的亲切关怀，妇幼保健事业的发展和福利设施的增进，又为妇女的参加社会生产和工作创造了更有利的条件。
    亲爱的姊妹们！我们深深地感觉到，我们的祖国是多么美好，我们的社会制度是多么优越，我们的前途是多么光明！能够参加这样壮丽的事业——把我们亲爱的祖国建设成伟大的社会主义国家，真是我们最大幸福与最高荣誉！
    我国已经以世界大国的身份出现在国际舞台上，成为亚洲与太平洋区域和平与安全的重要因素。我国同苏联和各人民民主国家一起，成为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。我国妇女是国际妇女和平民主运动中一支重要的力量。我们和各国妇女的友谊与团结一年来有很大的发展。单是去年国庆节时，我们中华全国民主妇女联合会就曾邀请了十七个国家的七十一位国际友人来中国参观和访问。经过了一段友好相处的日子，我们互相间的了解更增进了，友谊更亲密了，外国朋友们对我们要求和平与各国人民友好的真诚愿望有了深刻的印象。在这中间，也使我们深深感到朋友们的来访，就是对我们工作的一种监督和鼓励，今后我们还要欢迎更多的外国朋友来中国。去年我们也应邀派出了代表团到朝鲜、罗马尼亚、英国和法国去访问。这些访问都有助于增进我们相互间的了解和友谊。我们向外国朋友们学习到很多东西。外国朋友们对我们的希望、信心和友情更使我们感到自己责任的重大和和平的可贵，使我们更加决心要和全世界爱好和平的人们一起，把保卫和平的崇高事业担当起来，并为它奋斗到底！
    亲爱的姊妹们！今年迎接“三八”国际妇女节，我们欢庆祖国有这么多可喜的成就，同时我们也面临着建设祖国、保卫和平的严重任务。今年是我国第一个五年计划建设具有决定意义的一年，工业建设的任务特别繁重，农业方面也要争取更大的增产，还要巩固新建立的几十万个生产合作社。美帝国主义强占我国领土台湾，干涉中国内政，公开对我国进行战争挑衅，扬言要以武力干涉中国人民解放台湾，企图扩大对我国的侵略，造成了亚洲新的紧张局势，严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。在这样形势下，就不能不加重了我们解放台湾、保卫祖国、反抗侵略、保卫和平的任务。
    为了胜利完成伟大而艰巨的建设社会主义祖国和解放台湾、保卫世界和平的光荣任务，我们全国妇女必须更加紧密地团结起来，进一步提高爱国主义与社会主义的觉悟，发扬热爱祖国的光荣传统，巩固地树立热爱社会主义的思想，认识个人、家庭、集体和国家利益的一致性，认识建设和保卫社会主义的祖国就是我们的最高利益。在工厂中要努力增产节约，学习掌握新的技术，不断提高劳动生产率，完成和超额完成国家计划；在农村中要努力发展农业生产，积极参加互助合作组织；在各种岗位上都要热爱工作和忘我劳动。所有的妇女要保持和提高对敌人的警惕，坚决执行国家政策法令，巩固人民民主专政；要努力提高文化科学知识；在家庭中要勤劳治家、以社会主义精神教养子女，以社会主义道德原则处理家庭关系，从各方面来为建设社会主义的祖国与支援解放台湾而努力。
    现在全国人民正和全世界各国人民一起，热烈响应世界和平理事会的号召，展开反对使用原子武器的签名运动。这一运动表示了世界爱好和平人民对原子狂人准备发动原子战争的正义谴责，和反对使用原子武器、制止美国战争贩子的罪恶阴谋的坚定决心。我们全国城市与乡村、各阶层、各界的妇女要踊跃参加签名，来显示我们保卫和平劳动、保卫家庭、保卫孩子、保卫祖国、保卫和平的意志和力量。同时，我们要加强我们与苏联妇女、与各人民民主国家妇女和全世界爱好和平妇女之间的友好合作，把世界爱好和平反对战争的力量汇成一股不可抗拒的巨流，我们要正告美国侵略集团；如果它们敢于发动侵略战争，它们就必将在全世界人民汇成的不可抗拒的巨流中彻底淹没。
    国际民主妇联号召在今年七月召开一个拥护和平、保卫儿童的世界母亲大会。我们中国妇女要热烈响应号召，积极筹备和参加这个大会。我们中国母亲要与世界各国的母亲亲密地携起手来，为了保卫和平，保卫我们孩子们的美好未来而斗争。
    姐妹们！让我们团结一致，为建设祖国、保卫祖国，保卫和平而奋斗到底！
    “三八”国际妇女节万岁！
    中国妇女大团结万岁！
    世界妇女大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
