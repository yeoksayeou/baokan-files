    From Hu Feng's Ideological Errors from the Perspective of the Source of Literature and Art
    Nie Gannu
    I
    Hu Feng's idealistic literary thought is opposed to Marxism on every fundamental point, especially to all the arguments in Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This article intends to examine how Hu Feng's views contradict Marxism, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's views, on the question of what the source of literature and art is, and what the situation of Hu Feng's ideological errors is.
    Regarding the source of literature and art, the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" (hereinafter referred to as "Talks") states:
    Where does all literature and art come from? As ideological forms, all works of literature and art are products of the reflection of a given social life in the human brain. Revolutionary literature and art are the product of the reflection of the people's lives in the minds of revolutionary writers. There is a mine of literary and artistic raw materials in the people's lives, which are natural and crude, but also the most vivid, the richest, and the most fundamental; in this respect, they dwarf all literature and art, and they are the only inexhaustible source of all literature and art. This is the only source, because there can only be such a source, and there cannot be a second source.
    It is stated very clearly, affirming that the only source of literature and art is the life of the people. Hu Feng's view is not like this. He believes that the source of literature and art or creation is the "attitude of the writer towards life." In his article "What is Our Central Issue Today?" he quoted a passage from someone else's article and said: ... Our theory also touches on the writer's attitude towards life, which is the issue of the source of creation. ... Of course, we also know very well that "at present, some writers still have the serious error of being detached from or insufficiently connected with real life," but this is by no means merely a matter of "understanding," but mostly involves their actual attitude towards life itself, which cannot be helped by empty "encouragement" or "calls" from criticism (Sword, Literature, People, page 151). This passage was said two years before the "Talks" was published (1940), but two years after the "Talks" was published (1944), Hu Feng proposed another source: the writer's "self-expansion."
    For the embodiment process or overcoming process of the object, on the side of the writer as the subject, it is also a continuous process of self-expansion, a continuous process of self-struggle. ... After such a self-struggle, the writer can achieve self-expansion on the authenticity of historical demands, this is the source of artistic creation ("Days of Countercurrent" pages 24-25). But there is also a third source: "found" from the joys and sorrows of the rise and fall of new and old lives. The same article says:
    The decline of the old life and its struggles and pains in the process of decline, the growth of the new life and its joys and hardships in the process of growth, from here, the great nation has found the road to eternal life, and from here, the great literature and art has found the source of creation (ibid., page 29). That is to say, whether before or after the publication of the "Talks," Hu Feng believed that there was no "only source" for literature and art, but sometimes it was the "attitude... of the writer," sometimes it was the writer's "self-expansion," and the last one touched on "life," tracing back to before entering the creative process, seemingly close to the saying of "the life of the people." But the term "life" is ambiguous in meaning; if forced to explain it, it probably means the content or meaning of life, existence, or life from a personal perspective, which is not synonymous with the life of the people. Moreover, this statement does not occupy any position in his "theory." From his entire "theory," the source of literary creation is something endowed by the writer himself, something in the creative process.
    II
    Since the life of the people is the "only source" of literature and art, and "there cannot be a second source," what should writers do to draw from this source? Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us to go to the masses of the people:
    China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers and peasants for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only and most extensive and richest source, observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all original materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process.
    If the life of the people is not the source of literature and art, and the source of literature and art is the writer's "attitude" or "self-expansion" towards the subject matter, then writers only need to look inward to find the source of creation, and there is no need to go to the masses. Therefore, Hu Feng used all kinds of reasons, sometimes directly and often circuitously, to prevent writers from going to the masses and oppose writers from participating in actual struggles.
    In 1937, the year when the War of Resistance Against Japan began, which was also the year when his "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" stated that "the national crisis was unprecedentedly serious," he said in the article "A Brief Discussion on the Lack of Access to Literature":
    ... If a writer is faithful to art and strives painstakingly to seek the most unpretentious, the most vibrant, and the most capable form of expression that can express the content of life he wants to capture, then even if he has not experienced great life waves like Shiga, his work can achieve a high degree of artistic truth. Because, when the author painstakingly pursues an expression that is seamlessly integrated with his own body and mind, he is also pursuing life, and the result of this pursuit is the embrace of the author and life, which is also the embrace of life and art. This is a matter of the writer's essential attitude, and it can never be achieved by the effort of hammering words and refining sentences. If put in abstract terms, that is, a true realistic method of creation can make up for the writer's lack of life experience and defects in his worldview ("Small Records of Customs in the Dense Cloud Period" pages 99-100). "Unpretentious," "vibrant," "bodily and mental response," "life," "embrace"... Using a lot of vague and confusing words, "true realism creation method" is explained as "seeking... the most capable form of expression to express the content of life he wants to capture." It has not been explained what is the difference between "painstakingly" "seeking" a certain "form of expression" and "hammering words and refining sentences." Regardless of this, one point is obvious, at that time when "the national crisis was unprecedentedly serious," he said to those writers who were considering going to the masses: "Lack of life experience" and even "defects in worldview" do not matter, as long as they are willing to "seek" the "most capable form of expression to express the content of life he wants to capture," it is "able to make up for," therefore, there is no need to go to the masses, there is no need to participate in any actual struggle to win the realization of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    In 1942, in the article "Two or Three Thoughts on the Development of Creation," he answered a youth's question:
    ... A writer does not have to kill someone himself to write about a murderer, but he must have a "social instinct" that can experience the psychological state of a murderer. Hearsay material is also acceptable, the question is whether you can use your spiritual power to extract living things from those materials ("In Confusion" page 23).
    There is no need to discuss whether writing about a murderer requires killing someone first or whether hearsay material can be written. No one has ever said that writing about a murderer requires killing someone first or that any subject matter must be experienced personally from beginning to end. The question is that Hu Feng is proving here that creation can do without life experience; if a writer has a "social instinct" or "spiritual power," revolution or war can be written based on "hearsay," and the matter of going to the masses to draw the source of creation is completely negated.
    In 1948, "To the Singers Who Sing for the People":
    Suffering in the suffering people is not that there will be poetry only after being killed together with the killed, and there will be poetry only after being raped together with the raped, but to have a heart of sharing life, suffering, and death with the killed and the raped. Advancing in the advancing people does not necessarily mean that there will be poetry only after walking among the advancing people, ... but to have a heart of deeply grasping this advance, sincerely believing in this advance, and resolutely striving for this advance ("For Tomorrow" pages 137-138). According to Hu Feng's statement, it seems as if even the writers who "go to the masses" do not even have the common sense that if they are "killed together with the killed," they will have no "poetry" at all! It is said that "this was written in 1948, when the Liberation War was heading towards a decisive moment, for a series of publications jointly published by new poetry groups from various universities in Beiping. At that time, the anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle of young students was standing on the front line of welcoming the Liberation War" ("Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" page 45). At such an important juncture, Hu Feng, like in the year of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when teaching writers not to participate in actual struggles, imparted such a creative secret or a secret to living in the world to "the singers who sing for the people": "Advancing in the advancing people does not necessarily mean walking among the advancing people"!
    In 1954, in the "Explanatory Materials on Several Theoretical Issues," he regarded the theory of calling on writers to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the second of the "five 'theoretical' knives," which would kill writers and kill literature and art:
    Only the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers are considered life, daily life is not life, and one can do without a stand or have a little less of a stand. This dissects life, makes the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers into vacuum tubes, and gradually paralyzes the sensory functions of writers before they go into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers; thus making writers afraid and unnecessary to regard the past and present lives as life, and thus unable to understand and unable to absorb any life, especially the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers ("Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" pages 140-141).
    Hu Feng is truly "sensitive," able to think that calling on writers to go into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers means announcing that "daily life is not life," and as soon as it is announced, it will "gradually paralyze the sensory functions" of writers in daily life, and "unable to understand and unable to absorb any life, especially the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers." So, how can the writer's sensory functions be sharpened to "understand" more deeply and "absorb" more richly the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers? It goes without saying: to regard the writer's daily life as the most important life or the only life, and resolutely oppose writers from going into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers!
    From the above, it should be possible to see how Hu Feng's views are opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's views. What is strange is why, after he saw and expressed support for Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks," he still insisted on, but more cleverly, promoting his set of views that are completely opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's views?
    III
    The life of the people is the source of literature and art, and to draw from that source, writers must go to the masses. But what to do when going to the masses? Comrade Mao Zedong said in the "Talks": "Only by representing the masses can we educate the masses, and only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses." In the eyes of intellectuals, this is not easy. We must intensify our studies and transform our thoughts and feelings in order to understand the masses and be understood by the masses, and to be familiar with the masses and be familiar to the masses. Regarding learning and transformation, Comrade Mao Zedong has constantly given us many instructions. The following are two short paragraphs from the "Talks":
    A revolutionary writer who claims to be a Marxist, especially a party-member writer, must have the knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. But now some comrades lack the basic views of Marxism. ... It is right that literary and art workers should study literary and artistic creation, but Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers cannot be an exception. Literary and art workers should study society, that is, they should study the various classes in society, study their interrelationships and their respective conditions, study their faces and their psychology. Only by making these clear can our literature and art have rich content and a correct direction.
    Many comrades love to say "popularization," but what is popularization? It is that the thoughts and feelings of our literary and art workers are integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. ... If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to integrate with the masses, you must make up your mind and undergo a long-term and even painful tempering. ... We literary and art workers of intellectual origin, in order to make our works welcomed by the masses, must make a change and a transformation in our thoughts and feelings. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be incompatible.
    Since Hu Feng believes that the source of literature and art is not the life of the people, and writers do not need to go to the masses to draw anything, the problem of the distance between the thoughts and feelings of writers and the people will of course not arise; he simply opposes learning and transformation across the board.
    First, using the example of Balzac to oppose it, he said:
    For example, Balzac. He was a royalist, and his worldview not only had defects and limitations, but was also reactionary. ... Balzac had to violate his own class sympathies and political prejudices, and most sharply satirized the aristocratic men and women he sympathized with, ... but instead described his political enemies with undisguised admiration... ("Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" page 20). Look, Balzac's worldview was reactionary, and he could also write non-reactionary works, which shows that thoughts and consciousness are irrelevant to creation, so writers do not need to learn and transform. The matter of Balzac will be discussed below, and will be put aside for the time being.
    Secondly, using "A History of Literature" and Lu Xun as examples, oppose learning and transformation:
    Even if they have not yet accepted this revolutionary thought, and before the struggle guided by this revolutionary thought has occurred, intellectual writers who have a connection with the people in a certain relationship, due to "observation" of reality, that is, Lu Xun's so-called "lessons from facts," although more difficult, it is still possible to enter the content of the people to a corresponding degree, absorb the demands of the people flowing into their own bodies, and thus grasp the true essence of historical reality. "A History of Literature" provides rich examples, and this is how Lu Xun stood out in Chinese history ("On the Road of Realism" page 80). This seems to say that it does not matter if there is no revolutionary thought, as long as there is "observation of reality" and "lessons from facts." But since what is said is the situation before accepting revolutionary thought and before the struggle guided by this revolutionary thought has occurred, and the road is "more difficult," and the grasp of reality is only "to a corresponding degree," does this not prove that when one should accept revolutionary thought, in the midst of or after the struggle guided by this revolutionary thought has occurred, learning and transformation is a relatively smooth road for writers, and is it to make the degree to which writers grasp reality beyond the "corresponding" one?
    Finally, he said that learning and transformation is the third of the "five 'theoretical' knives":
    Only after ideological transformation is done well can one create, which makes writers leave practice, leave labor, and cannot allow real content to enter their own insides, and they wither and decline day by day, making ideological transformation an empty word or a counter-word. ("Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" page 141) He added the two words "done well" after "ideological transformation." In this way, he completely caricatured learning and transformation. Learning and transformation, in its original meaning, is a long-term thing, and it is very difficult to draw a clear line between good and not good. By adding the two words "done well," he first makes learning and transformation a rigid thing, creating a rigid impression of learning and transformation for readers, and then says "only after ideological transformation is done well can one create," making ideological transformation seem like ice and charcoal with creation and life practice, in order to reach his conclusion of "empty words or counter-words." But the words "only after ideological transformation is done well can one create," and the idea that one absolutely cannot create during the process of ideological transformation, seem to have not been said by others, but by Hu Feng himself. Anxious to oppose learning and transformation, one cannot help but put a stroke of white powder on the nose of his opponent, turning him into a clown. This tactic is commonly used by Hu Feng, and "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" is almost entirely like this.
    IV
    Not taking the life of the people as the source of literature and art, and not advocating that writers go to the masses and learn and transform, Hu Feng's literary and art problems are only left with the writer's creative attitude or creative process. Therefore, his "theory" starts from the writer entering the creative process, cutting off all social practice before entering this process. Since this is the case, it is bound to concentrate everything belonging to social practice in the creative process, and it is bound to be unable to explain many problems in the creative process. "Self-expansion," "social instinct," having a "heart" of suffering or advancing together with the people, without going among the people, "subjective fighting spirit," "personality strength," "benevolent heart," overcoming "double personality," and so on (please allow me to doubt: is it because there are so many statements that he has not yet "pursued" a "most unpretentious, most vibrant, and most capable form of expression that can express the content of life he wants to capture"?), it is enough to decorate the writer into a saintly image shining with a halo, and to describe creation as a vivid and bloody crucifixion myth. But the reason why it can become a saintly image and a myth is nothing more than cutting off all social practice before entering the creative process.
    There is a type of writer who, without experiencing the so-called "big waves of life," must be more imaginative and have a greater ability to reason in order to reflect objective reality. This is indeed an arduous journey in creation, and it requires tremendous perseverance. The "Dark Night's Passing" by Shiga Naoya that Hu Feng mentioned, who published the first half more than ten years before publishing the second half, his creation was arduous. Although arduous, it has nothing to do with "double personality." Hu Feng's theory of "overcoming 'double personality'" is not needed here. Another type of writer is Balzac, whose political views were reactionary. But he "violated his own class sympathies and political prejudices," "satirized the aristocratic men and women he sympathized with," and "praised" his "political enemies." Balzac's misfortune was that his thoughts lagged behind reality, his political views violated the regularity of the objective reality he wanted to reflect (that is, the "inner logic" of the "material" that Hu Feng mentioned), which is the inconsistency between the subjective and the objective. If he were to continue writing according to his subjective wishes, he would become more and more unreal, and therefore less and less art; if he were to write according to objective truth, that is, faithfully to reality and art, the distance between him and his subjective wishes would become farther and farther. Which way is it? Here comes the writer's inner "arduous struggle." Here, the regularity of objective reality overcomes the writer's subjective prejudices, which is what Engels called the "victory of realism"; rather than the "self-expansion" or "spiritual expansion" of the writer's subjective world gaining victory. On the contrary, those subjective things were beaten to pieces in his creative process.
    But are these two creative processes, whether it is Shiga Naoya or Balzac, are they destined, permanent, and must all writers of any era be like this, and if not, it would not be a creative process? I don't think so. In the case of Shiga Naoya, it is because he has not experienced any "waves of life." If he had experienced them, he would not have been so "dark night's passing," and he would have had to wait more than ten years to publish the second half of an 80,000-word novel. This shows that "waves of life" are important to a writer, and Comrade Mao Zedong's call for writers to go to the masses, to the fiery struggle, is completely correct; Hu Feng's theory of "not necessarily walking among the advancing people" is wrong. The reason why Balzac's creative process was arduous is because his political views were reactionary. Isn't it precisely these reactionary political views that hindered the author's deeper observation and understanding of reality? In feudal and capitalist societies, only a few talented writers who are faithful to reality break through the limitations of their own class prejudices and reactionary worldviews. Precisely because of this, Engels called it the "victory of realism." At the same time, it also shows how important it is for writers to obtain a correct worldview. Comrade Mao Zedong's call for writers to learn and transform, not only to transform the objective world, but also to transform the subjective world, is completely correct; Hu Feng's opposition is wrong.
    Hu Feng said that the creative process should be like Shiga Naoya or Balzac. "'A History of Literature' provides rich examples." Not only does it provide "rich" examples, but even if it is all like this, it cannot scare people. If "A History of Literature" is like this, it does not mean that it will always be like this in the future. Just like a human history that has classes, it does not mean that there will always be classes in the future. Hu Feng's "theory" looks backward and not forward. It does not see what significant differences there are between the old world and the new world, and between the writers of the old world and the writers of the new world. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the "Talks":
    Many comrades come from the attics of Shanghai; from the attics to the revolutionary base areas, they have not only experienced two kinds of regions, but also two historical eras. One is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society ruled by big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and the other is a revolutionary new democratic society led by the proletariat. Arriving at the revolutionary base areas means arriving at an era unprecedented in China's thousands of years of history, when the masses of the people are in power. The characters around us and the objects of our propaganda are completely different. The past era is gone forever. What are the differences between the two "historical eras" and the writers of the two "historical eras"? Comrade Mao Zedong said:
    ... The rulers in those places oppress revolutionary literary and art workers and do not allow them the freedom to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Here, the situation is completely different. We encourage revolutionary literary and art workers to actively be close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, give them complete freedom to go to the masses, and give them complete freedom to create truly revolutionary literature and art. ... We say that we should study Marxism and study society in order to completely and thoroughly solve this problem. Does this not mean that writers in the old world cannot easily and even possibly approach the masses, cannot possibly or do not know how to consciously transform their own subjective world, and cannot but cause contradictions and divisions in the creative methods and worldviews in the creative process, and that writers in the new world do not need to be like writers in the past in these two points?
    Now that we have arrived at the present, can it be said that it is a mistake of the times to say that the creative process should be the same as that of certain writers in the past?
    V
    Literature and art is an ideology, which is determined by existence and is a reflection of existence. It cannot be independent of material existence. Therefore, saying that the source of literature and art is the life of the people means that existence determines consciousness, and consciousness reflects existence, which is materialism. Hu Feng believes that the source of literature and art is not the life of the people, but the writer's attitude or "self-expansion." Not only are those terms ambiguous in meaning and difficult for people to understand, but even if they are easy to understand, they all indicate that consciousness is independent of material existence and is not restricted by material existence, which is idealism.
    Since the source of literature and art is the life of the people, revolutionary and promising writers should take the initiative and actively go to the masses, to the fiery struggle to draw from that source, rather than waiting for that source to flow into their "own insides." Moreover, going to the masses is not only to draw the source of literature and art, but before being a writer, and at the same time as being a writer, to participate in that fiery struggle as a member of the masses. Only if the writer himself is a fighter, is a participant in the actual struggle, can he absorb the struggle into his "own insides" and reflect it deeply and vividly. But becoming a fighter or maintaining being a fighter cannot but have a transition process, and at the same time cannot but be a development process. In addition to absorbing "lessons from facts" among the masses, it is also necessary to actively and actively study Marxism-Leninism and study society to transform one's thoughts and feelings. This subjective effort is precisely to reduce the length and pain of that "long-term and even painful tempering" (see Comrade Mao Zedong's words quoted above), and at the same time to prevent a fighter from transforming into his opposite. Hu Feng believes that the source of literature and art is not the life of the people, and opposes writers going to the masses and learning and transforming, and can only regard literature and art as a "headless case" starting from entering the creative process; and regard the creative process as a bloody and miraculous battle. He wants writers to always learn from the arduous creative processes of certain writers in the past; unfortunately, that is impossible to learn, because he has not explained why those creative processes are particularly arduous, and if those writers have anything extraordinary, what is the origin of that extraordinary thing, and how to obtain it, and he cannot explain it - as soon as he explains it, he will overthrow his entire "theory." This creates his "theory" on mysticism, or agnosticism.
    Hu Feng's works quote many words from Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as if he himself is a Marxist. But Marxists, such as Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong, whenever they talk about literary and art issues, always combine literature and art with the people, and with the people's actual struggle; they always call on writers to go to the masses, to the actual struggle, and to integrate with the people, with the proletariat, and with the Party. Hu Feng is just the opposite, he always describes literature and art as having nothing to do with the people, and uses all kinds of clever rhetoric to call on writers to leave the people, and at the same time naturally leave the proletariat and leave the Party. This is a strange "Marxism," a satire of Marxism.
    Tear apart Hu Feng's idealistic "Marxist" paper coat!

    从文艺源泉问题看胡风的思想错误
    聂绀弩
    一
    胡风的唯心主义文艺思想，在每一基本点上，都是与马克思主义对立的，特别与毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的全部论点是对立的。本文想从文艺的源泉是什么这一问题，看胡风的意见怎样与马克思主义，特别是与毛泽东同志的意见相对立，以及胡风的思想错误的情况是怎样的。
    关于文艺的源泉，“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”（以下简称“讲话”）中说：
    一切种类的文学艺术的源泉究竟是从何而来的呢？作为观念形态的文艺作品，都是一定的社会生活在人类头脑中的反映的产物。革命的文艺，则是人民生活在革命作家头脑中的反映的产物。人民生活中本来存在着文学艺术原料的矿藏，这是自然形态的东西，是粗糙的东西，但也是最生动、最丰富、最基本的东西；在这点上说，它们使一切文学艺术相形见绌，它们是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。这是唯一的源泉，因为只能有这样的源泉，此外不能有第二个源泉。
    说得十分明确，肯定：文艺的唯一的源泉是人民的生活。胡风的见解不是这样。他认为文艺或创作的源泉是“作家对待生活的态度”。他在“今天，我们的中心问题是什么？”一文里，抄引了别人的一段文章之后说：……我们的理论也接触了作家对待生活的态度，也就是创作底源泉问题。……固然我们也很知道“目前还有一部分作家与现实生活脱离或联接得不够的严重错误”，但这决不仅仅是一个“理解”问题，而大都关涉到他们的对于生活本身的实际的态度，这就不是批评底空洞的“鼓励”或“号召”所能为力的（“剑·文艺·人民”一五一页）。这一段话是在“讲话”发表之前两年（一九四○）说的，但在“讲话”发表之后两年（一九四四），胡风又提出了另一个源泉：作家的“自我扩张”。
    对于对象的体现过程或克服过程，在作为主体的作家这一面，同时也就是不断的自我扩张过程，不断的自我斗争过程。……经过了这样的自我斗争，作家才能够在历史要求底真实性上得到自我扩张，这艺术创造底源泉（“逆流的日子”二四—二五页）。但还有第三个源泉：从新旧的人生的兴衰过程的苦乐中“找到”的。同上一文说：
    旧的人生底衰亡及其在衰亡过程上的挣扎和苦痛，新的人生底生长及其在生长过程上的欢乐和艰辛，从这里，伟大的民族找到了永生的道路，也从这里，伟大的文艺找到了创造的源泉（同上二九页）。这就是说，在“讲话”发表之前也好，之后也好，胡风都认为文艺没有什么“唯一的源泉”，而有时是“作家……的态度”，有时是作家的“自我扩张”，最后一种，接触到“人生”，离开了作家本人的创作过程而追溯到进入创作过程以前去了，似乎近于“人民的生活”的说法了。但“人生”这用语是含义不明的；强为之解，大概是从个人角度看的生活、生存、生命的内容或意义之类的意思，与人民的生活不是同义语。何况这一说法，在他的“理论”中，并不占什么位置。从他的整个“理论”看，文艺创造的源泉，是作家自身所禀赋的东西，是创作过程中的东西。
    二
    既然人民生活是文艺的“唯一的源泉”，“此外不能有第二个源泉”，作家要汲取这源泉，应该怎么办呢？毛泽东同志指示我们到人民群众中去：
    中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。
    如果人民的生活不是文艺的源泉，文艺的源泉是作家对题材的“态度”或“自我扩张”，作家要找创作的源泉，就只须反求诸己就行了，用不着到什么群众中去。因此，胡风用各种各样的理由，有时直截了当，经常是转弯抹角地阻止作家到群众中去，反对作家参加实际斗争。
    一九三七年，即抗战开始的那一年，也就是他的“对文艺问题的意见”中所说的“民族危机空前严重”的那一年，他在“略论文学无门”一文里说：
    ……如果一个作家忠实于艺术，呕心镂骨地努力寻求最无伪的、最有生命的、最能够说出他所要把捉的生活内容的表现形式，那么，即使他像志贺似地没有经过大的生活波涛，他底作品也能够达到高度的艺术的真实。因为，作者苦心孤诣地追求着和自己底身心底感应融然无间的表现的时候，同时也就是追求人生，这追求底结果是作者和人生的拥合，同时也就是人生和艺术的拥合了。这是作家底本质的态度问题，绝对不是锤字炼句的功夫所能够达到的。如果用抽象的话说，那就是，真实的现实主义的创作方法，能够补足作家底生活经验上的不足和世界观上的缺陷（“密云期风习小纪”九九—一○○页）。“无伪”、“有生命”、“身心感应”、“人生”、“拥合”……用一大堆迷离恍惚的词藻，把“真实的现实主义的创作方法”解释为“寻求……最能够说出他所要把捉的生活内容的表现形式”而已。“呕心镂骨地”“寻求”某种“表现形式”和“锤字炼句”的区别究竟何在也未得到说明。这且不管，有一点是显然的，在那“民族危机空前严重”的时候，向那些考虑到到群众中去的作家说：“生活经验不足”甚至“世界观上的缺陷”都不要紧，只要肯“寻求”“最能够说出所要把捉的生活内容的表现形式”是“能够补足”的，因此，用不着到群众中去，用不着参加争取抗战实现的任何实际斗争。
    一九四二年，他在“关于创作发展的二三感想”一文里答青年问：
    ……作家写杀人犯并不是得自己先杀死人，但他非有能够体验杀人犯底心理状态的那一份“社会本能”不成。道听途说的材料也可以，问题在于你能不能用你底精神力量从那些材料里面取出有生命的活的东西（“在混乱里面”二三页）。
    用不着讨论写杀人犯是否得先杀人以及道听途说的材料可不可以写的问题吧。谁也不曾说过写杀人犯就得先杀人或任何题材都非从头到尾亲身经历不可。问题是胡风在这里所证明的是创作可以不要生活经验；作家如果有一份“社会本能”或“精神力量”，革命也好，战争也好，都可以凭“道听途说”写出来，应当到群众中去汲取创作源泉的事，被否定得干干净净了。
    一九四八年，“给为人民而歌的歌手们”：
    在受难的人民里面受难，并不是要和被杀者一同被杀了以后才有诗，和被强奸者一同被强奸了以后才有诗，而是要有和被杀者被强奸者共生、共苦、共死的心。在前进的人民里面前进，并不一定是走在前进的人民中间了以后才有诗，……而是要有深沉地把握这个前进，真诚地信仰这个前进，坚决地争取这个前进的心（“为了明天”一三七—一三八页）。照胡风这样的说法，好像说“到群众中去”的就连作家如果“和被杀者一同被杀”了，就根本连“诗”都没有了的常识都不具备似的！据说“这是在解放战争走向决定关头的一九四八年，为北平各大学新诗团体联合出版的丛刊写的。当时青年学生底反蒋反美斗争是站在迎接解放战争的最前线”（“对文艺问题的意见”四五页）。在这样一个重要关头，胡风像在抗战那一年，教作家不必参加实际斗争一样，“给为人民而歌的歌手们”传授了这样一个“在前进的人民里面前进，并不一定是走在前进的人民中间”的创作秘诀或者说处世秘诀！
    一九五四年，在“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”里把号召作家深入工农兵生活的理论当作“五把‘理论’刀子”中的第二把，是害死作家杀死文艺的：
    只有工农兵的生活才算生活，日常生活不是生活，可以不要立场或少一点立场。这就把生活肢解了，使工农兵底生活成了真空管子，使作家到工农兵生活里去之前逐渐麻痹了感受机能；因而使作家不敢也不必把过去和现在的生活当作生活，因而就不能理解不能吸收任何生活，尤其是工农兵生活（“对文艺问题的意见”一四○—一四一页）。
    胡风真“敏感”，能够从号召作家到工农兵生活中去想到就是宣布“日常生活不是生活”，而一宣布就使作家在日常生活中先就“逐渐麻痹了感受机能”，而且“不能理解不能吸收任何生活，尤其是工农兵生活”。那么，怎样才能使作家的感受机能敏锐起来，更深刻“理解”、更丰富地“吸收”工农兵生活呢？不言而喻：把作家的日常生活当作头等生活或唯一生活，坚决反对作家到工农兵生活中去！
    以上，应该可以看出胡风的意见和毛泽东同志的意见是如何对立着的了。奇怪的是，为什么在他看到了并且表示了拥护毛泽东同志的“讲话”之后，还要坚持地，但是更巧妙地宣传他那一套与毛泽东同志的意见完全对立的意见呢？
    三
    文艺的源泉是人民的生活，要汲取那源泉，作家须到群众中去。但到群众中去做什么呢？毛泽东同志在“讲话”中说：“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”，在知识分子看来，这都不是轻而易举的。必须加紧学习，改造自己的思想感情，才能了解群众也为群众所了解，熟习群众也为群众所熟习。关于学习和改造，毛泽东同志不断地给过我们很多指示，下面是“讲话”里的两小段：
    一个自命为马克思主义的革命作家，尤其是党员作家，必须有马克思列宁主义的知识。但是现在有些同志却缺少马克思主义的基本观点。……文艺工作者应该学习文艺创作，这是对的，但是马克思列宁主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外。文艺工作者要学习社会，这就是说，要研究社会上的各个阶级，研究它们的相互关系和各自状况，研究它们的面貌和它们的心理。只有把这些弄清楚了，我们的文艺才能有丰富的内容和正确的方向。
    许多同志爱说“大众化”，但是什么叫做大众化呢？就是我们的文艺工作者的思想感情和工农兵大众的思想感情打成一片。……你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。……我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。
    胡风既认为文艺的源泉不是人民的生活，作家又无须到群众中去汲取什么，因之作家与人民的思想感情的距离之类的问题，也当然不会发生；对学习改造干脆地一律予以反对。
    首先，以巴尔扎克的事例来反对，他说：
    例如巴尔扎克。他是保皇党，他的世界观不但有缺陷和限制，而且是反动的。……巴尔扎克不得不违反了他自己的阶级同情和政治偏见，最尖刻不过地讽刺了他所同情的贵族男女，……反而用掩藏不了的赞美描写了他政治上的死敌……（“对文艺问题的意见”二○页）。瞧，巴尔扎克的世界观是反动的，也能写出不反动的作品，可见思想意识之类，对于创作，是无关紧要的，所以作家用不着学习改造。关于巴尔扎克的事，下文会谈到，暂置不论。
    其次，以“一部文学史”和鲁迅为例，反对学习改造：
    就是还没有接受这个革命思想，在被这个革命思想所引导的斗争发生之前，在某一关联上和人民有着联系的知识分子作家，由于对实际的“观察”，即鲁迅所说的“由于事实的教训”，虽然更为艰难，但依然有可能在相应的程度上进入人民底内容，吸取人民底要求流在自己身里，因而把握到历史现实底真实的本质的。“一部文学史”就提供了丰富的例证，鲁迅就是这样在中国历史上站了出来的（“论现实主义的路”八○页）。这似乎是说，没有革命思想不要紧，只要有“对于实际的观察”、“事实的教训”就行了。但是既然所说的是没有接受革命思想，在被这个革命思想所引导的斗争发生之前的情况，那路又“更为艰难”，把握现实又只“在相应的程度上”，岂不就证明在应该接受革命思想的时候，在被这个革命思想所引导的斗争发生的当中或之后，学习改造对于作家是较为坦荡的路，是使作家把握现实的程度在“相应的”以上的么？
    最后，他说学习改造是“五把‘理论’刀子”的第三把：
    只有思想改造好了才能创作，这就使作家脱离了实践，脱离了劳动，无法使现实内容走进自己内部，一天一天干枯下去，衰败下去，使思想改造成了一句空话或反话。（“对文艺问题的意见”一四一页）他在“思想改造”之后，添了“好了”两字。这样一来，就把学习改造完全漫画化了。学习改造，就其本来的意义说，是一件长期的事情，好与未好之间是很不容易划出一道明确的界线来。他添上“好了”两字，先使学习改造变成一种死硬的东西，造成读者对学习改造的一种死硬的印象，然后说“只有思想改造好了才能创作”，把思想改造说成和创作以及生活实践是冰炭水火，以达到他的“空话或反话”的结论。但“只有思想改造好了才能创作”，在思想改造过程中绝对不能创作之类的话，似乎没有别人说过，是胡风自己说的。急于反对学习改造，不免在他的论敌的鼻子上涂上一笔白粉，使他变成丑角。这战法是胡风所惯用的，“对文艺问题的意见”一书几乎全部如此。
    四
    不以人民生活为文艺源泉，不主张作家到群众中去和学习改造，胡风的文艺问题，就只剩下作家的创作态度或创作过程了。所以，他的“理论”，是从作家走进创作过程开始的，切掉了走进这过程以前的一切社会实践。既然如此，势必把一切属于社会实践的东西都集中在创作过程里面，势必对于创作过程里面的许多问题都不能解释。“自我扩张”、“社会本能”，不走进人民中间而有和人民一同受难或前进的“心”、“主观战斗精神”、“人格力量”、“仁爱的胸怀”、克服“二重人格”，如是等等（请容许我怀疑一下：所以有如此多的说法，是不是表示至今还未“追寻”到一个“最无伪的、最有生命的、最能够说出他所要把捉的生活内容的表现形式”呢？），已足够把作家装璜成圆光闪耀的圣像，把创作说成活灵活现血迹斑斑的上十字架的神话了。但其所以能够成为圣像和神话，无非因为切掉了走进创作过程以前的一切社会实践。
    有一种作家，没有经过所谓“大的生活波涛”，要反映客观现实，就必须比别的作家更富于想像和推理的能力。这在创作上确实是一段艰苦的路程，非有巨大的毅力不可的。胡风所说的志贺直哉在发表了上半篇十多年之后再发表下半篇的“暗夜行路”，他的创作是艰辛的。艰辛虽艰辛，却与“二重人格”无关，胡风的“克服”“二重人格”说，这里用不着。另一种作家是巴尔扎克，他的政治见解是反动的。但“违反了他自己的阶级同情和政治偏见”，“讽刺了他所同情的贵族男女”，“赞美”了他“政治上的死敌”。巴尔扎克的不幸，在于他的思想落后于实际，他的政治见解与他所要反映的客观现实的规律性（即胡风所说的“素材”的“内在逻辑”）相违反，也就是主观与客观的不一致。要照主观愿望写下去，就会越写越不真实，因而也越不是艺术；要照客观的真实写下去，即忠实于现实和艺术，就越写越和主观愿望的距离越远。究竟是这样呢还是那样呢？这里就来了作家内心的“艰苦斗争”。这里，客观现实的规律性克服了作家主观的偏见，也就是恩格斯所说的“现实主义的胜利”；而不是作家的主观世界取得胜利的“自我扩张”或“精神扩张”。相反，那些主观的东西在他的创作过程中被打得落花流水。
    但是志贺直哉也好，巴尔扎克也好，这两种创作过程，是宿命的，永久的，任何时代的任何作家都必须如此，不如此就不成其为创作过程么？我以为不是的。在志贺直哉的场合，是因为他没有经历过什么“生活波涛”，如果经历了，他就不会那么“暗夜行路”，八万字的小说，一定要等到十多年之后才发表下半篇。这就说明“生活波涛”对于一个作家是重要的，毛泽东同志号召作家到群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，就完全正确；胡风的“不一定是走在前进的人民中间”论是错误的。巴尔扎克的创作过程之所以艰苦，是因为他的政治见解是反动的，难道不正是这种反动的政治见解，妨碍了作者对现实的更深刻的观察和理解吗？在封建社会、资本主义社会中，只有少数有天才的忠实于现实的作家才突破了自己阶级偏见和反动世界观的限制。正因为这样，所以恩格斯叫做“现实主义的胜利”。同时也正说明了取得正确的世界观对于作家何等重要，毛泽东同志号召作家学习改造，不但改造客观世界，并且改造主观世界，就完全正确；胡风的反对是错误的。
    胡风说，创作过程应该像志贺直哉或巴尔扎克那样。“‘一部文学史’就提供了丰富的例证”。不但只提供了“丰富的”例证，就是全部如此，也唬不倒人。“一部文学史”如此，并不等于以后永远如此。正像一部人类史都有阶级，并不等于说以后也永远有阶级一样。胡风的“理论”是向后看而不向前看。没有看见旧世界和新世界，旧世界的作家和新世界的作家之间有什么显著的差别。毛泽东同志在“讲话”中说：
    同志们很多是从上海亭子间来的；从亭子间到革命根据地，不但是经历了两种地区，而且是经历了两个历史时代。一个是大地主大资产阶级统治的半封建半殖民地的社会，一个是无产阶级领导的革命的新民主主义的社会。到了革命根据地，就是到了中国历史几千年来空前未有的人民大众当权的时代。我们周围的人物，我们宣传的对象，完全不同了。过去的时代，已经一去不复返了。两个“历史时代”以及两个“历史时代”的作家的差别是怎样的呢？毛泽东同志说：
    ……那些地方的统治者压迫革命文艺家，不让他们有到工农兵群众中去的自由。在我们这里，情形就完全两样。我们鼓励革命文艺家积极地亲近工农兵，给他们以到群众中去的完全自由，给他们以创作真正革命文艺的完全自由。……我们说要学习马克思主义和学习社会，就是为着完全地彻底地解决这个问题。这不是说旧世界的作家不容易乃至不可能接近群众，不可能或不知道有意识地改造自己的主观世界，不能不在创作过程中引起创作方法和世界观的矛盾分裂，新世界的作家在这两点上都用不着像以前的作家那样么？
    到了现在，还说创作过程要跟以前的某些作家一样，可不可以说是时代错误？
    五
    文艺是一种意识形态，是由存在所决定的，是存在的反映。它不能离开物质存在而独立。因此，说文艺的源泉是人民的生活，就是说存在决定意识，意识反映存在，是唯物主义。胡风认为文艺的源泉不是人民的生活，而是作家的态度或“自我扩张”，不但那些用语含义暧昧，不容易使人理解，就是容易理解，也都表示意识是离开物质存在而独立的，不受物质存在的制约的，是唯心主义。
    既然文艺的源泉是人民的生活，革命的、有出息的作家，就应该主动地积极地到群众中去、到火热的斗争中去汲取那源泉，而不是等待那源泉流到“自己内部”来。而且到群众中去还不仅是汲取文艺的源泉，在作为一个作家之先，在和作为一个作家同时，作为群众中的一员去参加那火热的斗争。只有作家自己是战斗者，是实际战斗的参与者，他才能把战斗吸收到“自己内部”来，而且深刻和生动地反映它。但成为战斗者或保持其为战斗者，不能不有一个转变过程，同时也不能不是一个发展过程。这除了在群众中吸收“事实的教训”以外，还要主动地积极地学习马克思列宁主义和学习社会以改造自己的思想感情。这主观的努力，正所以减轻那“长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”（见前引毛泽东同志的话）的长期性和痛苦程度，同时也防止一个战斗者向他的对立物转化。胡风认为文艺的源泉不是人民的生活，反对作家到群众中去和学习改造，就只能把文艺看成从走进创作过程开始的“无头公案”；把创作过程看成一种鲜血淋漓的战斗奇迹。他要作家永远向过去的某些作家的艰苦的创作过程学习；不幸那又是无法学习的，因为那创作过程之所以特别艰苦的原因何在，那些作家如果有什么过人之处，那过人之处由何产生，如何获致，他都没有说明，也不能说明——一说明就把他自己的全部“理论”都推翻了。这样就造成了他的“理论”上的神秘主义，或者说无知主义。
    胡风的著作，引用了许多马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的话，好像他自己就是马克思主义者。但马克思主义者，如列宁，如毛泽东同志，无论在什么时候，只要谈到文艺问题，总是把文艺和人民，和人民的实际斗争结合着的；总是号召作家到群众中去，到实际斗争中去，和人民、和无产阶级、和党打成一片。胡风刚刚相反，他总是把文艺说成与人民没有关系，用各种巧妙的说词叫作家离开人民，同时自然也离开无产阶级、离开党。这是一种奇怪的“马克思主义”，是对马克思主义的讽刺。
    撕碎胡风的唯心主义的“马克思主义”的纸外套！
