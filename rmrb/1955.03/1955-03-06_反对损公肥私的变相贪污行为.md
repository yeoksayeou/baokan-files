To the Editor:

    In recent years, with the development of national construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the treatment of many cadres in government offices has gradually changed from the supply system to the wage system. When cadres enjoyed the supply system, the education and upbringing expenses of their children in cadre children's schools, nurseries, and kindergartens were covered by the government, as stipulated. However, after some cadres switched to the wage system and their income increased along with their living standards, they were capable of bearing the education and upbringing expenses of their children, but they still allowed their children to enjoy public funding, unwilling to consciously and proactively apply to cancel this benefit. Some cadres even intentionally concealed their income situation for a long time after switching to the wage system, or repeatedly delayed paying education and upbringing expenses under various pretexts. Some people satirize this phenomenon by saying, "The parents are on the wage system, but the children are on the supply system." In this way, they reduce their own burden but increase the burden on the country. Recently, Beijing Yucai Primary School issued a survey form regarding the treatment of students' parents. The results of the survey showed that among the original 780 students enjoying public funding, the parents of 99 students had both switched to the wage system, and the parents of 123 students had one parent on the wage system. None of them had consciously paid living and education expenses to the school. For example, Lei Feng, the deputy director of the Statistics Department of Renmin University of China, has two children studying at Beijing Yucai Primary School. Because the parents were on the supply system when they enrolled, all the students' expenses were covered by the government. Lei Feng switched to the wage system as early as July 1953, and for more than two years, his two children have still been enjoying generous subsidies from the government. In addition, the parents of 20 students did not fill in the treatment column at all, making it impossible for the school to know whether the students' parents had switched to the wage system.
    As I understand it, in Beijing, similar situations exist in Huabei Primary School, Beihai Kindergarten, and other public primary schools and nurseries. Some students' parents see that others have not paid their fees in time, so they also do not pay, saying, "If others don't pay, wouldn't we be wronged if we paid?" Some students' parents do not inquire about payment matters after changing jobs.
    Why haven't these cadres taken the initiative to promptly declare to the relevant personnel departments of the schools that they can bear the expenses of their children? It is not because they do not understand the system, because the personnel departments have clear regulations: after cadres switch to the wage system, unless they have too many children and too little income and are approved by the organization for subsidies, the living and education expenses of their children should be borne by themselves. Why do they intentionally take advantage of the government and enrich themselves at public expense? Isn't this a disguised form of corruption?
    In our country, abiding by national regulations, cherishing public property, and saving national expenditures are the moral qualities that cadres of government offices should possess. The above-mentioned acts of enriching oneself at public expense cannot but be a flaw in the quality of cadres. Of course, schools and relevant departments also have responsibilities. Many schools and nurseries lack strict fee collection systems and have not taken effective measures to correct the phenomenon of non-payment. Ding Zhigang

### 反对损公肥私的变相贪污行为

    反对损公肥私的变相贪污行为编辑同志：
    最近几年来，随着国家建设事业的发展和人民生活水平的提高，很多机关干部的待遇正由供给制逐步改为工资制。有些干部在享受供给制待遇的时候，他们的子女在干部子弟学校、托儿所和幼儿园里的教养费都按规定由公家供给。但是，有些干部在改为工资制以后，收入增多了，生活水平提高了，自己有能力负担子女的教养费了，而他们却仍然让子女享受着公费待遇，不肯自觉地、主动地申请撤销这种待遇；甚至有一部分干部在改为工资制以后，有意地长期隐瞒待遇情况或者寻找各种借口一再拖延不缴教养费用。有人讽刺这种现象说“父母是工资制，子女是供给制”。这样，他们减轻了自己的负担，却加重了国家的负担。最近北京育才小学向每个学生的家长发出了一张学生家长待遇情况的调查表，调查的结果是：原来享受公费待遇的七百八十名学生中，有九十九名学生的父母双方已改为工资制，一百二十三名学生的父母一方已改为工资制，他们都没有自觉地向学校缴纳生活教养费。例如，中国人民大学统计系副主任雷峰有两个孩子在北京育才小学读书，因为入学时家长是供给制，学生的一切费用都由公家供给。雷峰早在一九五三年七月份就改为工资制了，两年多以来，他的两个孩子仍然享受着公家优厚的补助。另外，还有二十名学生的家长根本不填写待遇一栏，使得学校不能了解学生的家长是否已改为工资制。
    据我了解：在北京，华北小学、北海幼儿园和其他一些公立小学、托儿所还存在这样的情况，就是有些学生家长看见别人没有及时缴费，自己也就不缴，他们说：“别人不缴，我们缴了岂不冤枉”。有的学生家长调动工作后，对于缴费的事情就不问不闻了。
    为什么这些干部没有主动地及时向学校方面有关人事部门声明自己负担子女的费用呢？这并不是因为他们不了解制度，因为人事部门早有明确规定，干部在改为工资制后，除了子女过多而收入又少，经过组织批准予以补助外，子女生活教养费应该由自己负担，为什么他们有意地占公家的便宜，损公自肥呢？这不是变相的贪污行为吗？
    在我们国家里，遵守国家制度，爱护公共财产，节省国家开支，是机关干部应有的道德品质，上述这些损公肥私的表现，不能不是干部品质的缺陷。当然，学校和有关部门也是有责任的。很多学校和托儿所等都缺乏严格的收费制度，对于不缴费的现象没有采取有效的办法进行纠正，也是不对的。  丁志刚
