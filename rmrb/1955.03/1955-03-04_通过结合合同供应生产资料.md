    Supplying Means of Production Through Combined Contracts
    This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan Province have more extensively signed combined contracts with agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, planning to supply a large quantity of spring plowing production materials to farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Changsha County have already signed combined contracts with several hundred agricultural producers' cooperatives established in the first and second batches. The No. 7 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yiyang County had already signed combined contracts with eighteen agricultural producers' cooperatives and fifteen mutual aid teams by early February, with the planned supply of lime alone valued at three thousand yuan. These contracts generally specified the delivery time and quantity. In Shimen County, the four agricultural producers' cooperatives in the 12th district alone purchased several thousand catties of tung cakes and tea cakes from the supply and marketing cooperative in February, based on the combined contracts. After obtaining a large quantity of production materials from the supply and marketing cooperatives in a timely manner through combined contracts, these agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations have become even more actively involved in the spring plowing production campaign.

    通过结合合同供应生产资料
    湖南省各地供销合作社今年更广泛地同农业生产合作社、互助组签订了结合合同，有计划地把大批春耕生产资料供应给农民。长沙县各区供销合作社已经同第一批和第二批建立的几百个农业生产合作社签订了结合合同。益阳县第七区供销合作社在二月初已经同十八个农业生产合作社、十五个互助组订立了结合合同，仅预定供应的石灰就值三千元。这些合同中，一般都具体规定了交货的时间和数量。仅石门县第十二区的四个农业生产合作社就根据结合合同，在二月份内从供销合作社买到了几千斤梓饼和桐饼。这些农业生产互助合作组织通过结合合同，及时从供销合作社买到大批生产资料以后，都更加积极地投入了春耕生产运动。
