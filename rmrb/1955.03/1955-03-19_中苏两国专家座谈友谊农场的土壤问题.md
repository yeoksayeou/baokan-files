Sino-Soviet Experts Hold Symposium on Soil Problems at Friendship Farm

The Chinese Academy of Sciences recently held a symposium to discuss the soil survey and utilization of the state-owned Friendship Farm. In addition to Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Chinese soil and botany experts, consultants to the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kovda, agricultural consultants of the Ministry of Agriculture, Bunyak and Kolinjorov, Soviet experts of the state-owned Friendship Farm, Krechinikov and Vlasiuk, and consultant of Beijing Agricultural University, Neganov, attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Song Daquan, a Chinese soil scientist, first introduced the soil survey work of the Northeast Black Soil and the state-owned Friendship Farm. This work began in 1952 based on the general survey of the Northeast Black Soil and focused on key investigations. The area of the state-owned Friendship Farm was one of the key areas. In the past two years, some topographic maps, vegetation maps, and soil distribution maps have been made. Since November 1953, we have been working with Soviet experts and have received enthusiastic help from Soviet experts in our work. Improvements have been made in working methods and soil classification, and the working level and quality have been improved. Finally, a specific plan was made. Soviet expert Krechinikov introduced the basic situation of the soil survey of the state-owned Friendship Farm, made a detailed analysis of the soil types of the farm, and put forward opinions on utilization and improvement.

After the introduction, the existing problems were discussed, and everyone put forward opinions on the soil improvement methods. Finally, Kovda spoke and said: This symposium marks the close friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The labor of scientists from the two countries has provided a lot of valuable information for production. In addition, Kovda put forward opinions on the principles and specific measures for improving saline-alkali soil and soil marsh. (Shen Juying)

    中国科学院在最近举行了座谈会，讨论关于国营友谊农场的土壤调查和利用问题，出席的除了中国科学院副院长竺可桢，我国的土壤学和植物学专家以外，还有中国科学院院长顾问柯夫达，农业部顾问布尼亚克、柯林卓夫，国营友谊农场的苏联专家克雷契尼可夫、符拉修克，以及北京农业大学顾问涅干诺夫。
    会上首先由我国土壤学家宋达泉介绍了东北黑土及国营友谊农场的土壤调查工作，这项工作自一九五二年开始从东北黑土的普查基础上进行重点调查，其中国营友谊农场地区即为重点之一，两年来作出了一些地形图、植被图、土壤分布图等。一九五三年十一月起就与苏联专家共同工作，在工作中得到苏联专家热情的帮助，在工作方法、土壤分类等方面得到改进，并提高了工作水平与质量，最后做出了具体的规划。苏联专家克雷契尼可夫介绍了国营友谊农场土壤调查基本情况，把农场的土壤类型作了详细分析，提出了利用与改良的意见。
    在情况介绍后，即对存在的问题进行了讨论，大家对土壤的改良方法提出了意见。最后柯夫达发言，他说：这次座谈会标志着中苏两国间的亲密友谊，两国科学家的劳动已为生产提供了很多的宝贵资料。此外，柯夫达提出了对盐碱土和土壤沼泽化改良的方针和具体措施的意见。　（沈菊英）
