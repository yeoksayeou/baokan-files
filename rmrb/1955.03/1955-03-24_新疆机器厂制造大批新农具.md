The staff and workers of the Xinjiang Machine Factory are producing large quantities of new-style farm tools to support agricultural production. By the beginning of March, 12,987 new-style farm tools had been manufactured and left the factory, and are being continuously transported to the countryside.

This year, the weather in Xinjiang has warmed up earlier, and the snow on the Toutun River has begun to melt. "Seize the farming season" has become the slogan for the labor emulation drive of the machine factory's staff and workers. The tempering team of the grinding section of the casting workshop has accelerated the speed of loading and unloading furnace pillars, shortening the time for each furnace tempering, discharging from the kiln, and entering the kiln by two days compared to the past. Deng Dagui and five other workers in the nail-tooth harrow installation team of the farm tool workshop were originally divided into two work groups, but later divided into three groups, creating a record of exceeding the quota by 300 percent. Workers in the mechanical workshop heard the news of the liberation of Dachen Island, and their labor enthusiasm was even higher, completing the task of modifying cotton strip planters five days ahead of schedule.

    新疆机器厂制造大批新农具
    新疆机器厂职工大量生产新式农具支援农业生产。到三月初已有新式农具一万二千九百八十七部制成出厂，正在源源不断地运往农村。
    今年新疆天气暖的较早，头屯河的积雪已开始融化，“不误农时”成了机器厂职工开展劳动竞赛的口号。铸工车间剔磨工段回火小组加速了?柱进炉、出炉的速度，使每炉回火、出窑、进窑的时间较过去缩短了两天。农具车间钉齿钯安装一组工人邓大贵等六人，原来分为两个劳动小组，后来分成三个小组，创造了超过定额百分之三百的纪录。机械车间工人听到了大陈岛解放的消息，劳动热情更为高涨，提前五天完成了改装棉花条播机的任务。
