On Arranging Spring Rural Work

With the arrival of the spring plowing season, how to arrange various work tasks in rural areas to concentrate efforts on organizing spring plowing and sowing is an extremely important issue. This spring, the rural work tasks are very heavy. In addition to spring plowing and sowing, unified grain purchase and sales, troop conscription, dike and polder repairs, consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, production and disaster relief in disaster areas, and other economic work are all important political and economic tasks, each requiring great effort to accomplish. These tasks are directly linked to the vital interests of farmers. Doing a good job in unified grain purchase and sales will stabilize farmers' emotions and boost their enthusiasm for production, without a doubt. The necessity of troop conscription is already known to everyone. We must seize the time to do it well now, and should not delay it, affecting spring plowing and sowing. As for dike and polder repairs, consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, and production and disaster relief in disaster areas, these are inherently part of spring plowing production; it is easy to understand that these tasks must be done well.

The content of this year's production tasks is clearly different from that of the past few years. In the past few years, many things had not yet been incorporated into the planned economy as they are today, and certain socialist economic measures had not been implemented. The economic links between farmers' production and the state's purchase and supply had not yet developed as they have after taking these measures. In the past few years, there were not so many agricultural production cooperatives, and farmers' production was almost entirely based on the individual economy. Now there are cooperatives including more than 13 million households, and their own production needs state help and leadership to proceed well. This group of cooperatives has already had a huge impact on national agricultural production. If these cooperatives are not run well, it will affect the production mood of farmers outside the cooperatives; if these cooperatives are run well, they can drive farmers to develop production. This makes it very clear: the content of agricultural production work in rural areas is not as simple as it used to be. In addition to organizing the masses to cultivate and sow in a timely manner, running cooperatives well, and doing a good job in unified grain purchase and sales (mainly sales in spring), as well as other economic work, such as supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and material supply, have become indispensable components of organizing production work. Without a unified planning method, subjectively hoping to simplify the content of work is impossible, this is one aspect. On the other hand, every one of our rural work cadres must also understand: in rural areas, especially in the spring, we must put the most important task in production – spring plowing and sowing – in the first place. Because the entire livelihood of all farmers depends on production throughout the year, and spring plowing and sowing is the most critical time for spring plowing production. If our work deviates from production, it also deviates from the masses. Any work that hinders agricultural production, if it is not combined with agricultural production, but contrary to it, is absolutely wrong. The most important problem in rural areas today is that spring plowing production is unattended in many areas, left to its own devices, allowing other work that is supposed to serve production to squeeze out production, so that spring plowing production has not yet been carried out very well. Some people excuse themselves by saying that there are too many work tasks and they cannot be arranged for the time being, so they relax production. This phenomenon is very dangerous and must be changed quickly, otherwise it will cause irreparable losses to the annual agricultural production.

Leading farmers to complete this year's agricultural production plan is a major contribution of all rural work cadres to the country's industrialization. Now the agricultural production plans of all provinces and cities have been determined. These plans are all active, full of enterprising spirit, proving that the importance of developing agricultural production has been deeply rooted in people's hearts, arousing everyone's high attention. However, formulating a plan is only the first step; turning the plan into reality requires hard work and continuous effort. Everyone knows that although our country's grain and cotton production last year and the year before both developed each year, they were not completed according to plan due to natural disasters. This has aggravated the seriousness of the supply of agricultural products falling short of demand, aggravated the agricultural production tasks for the last three years of the Five-Year Plan, and aggravated the responsibilities of all rural work cadres and the broad masses of farmers. This year is the third year of the Five-Year Plan. In order to support the country's industrial construction, meet the growing needs of the people across the country, and strive for a balance between industrial and agricultural production, we must complete and overfulfill this year's agricultural production tasks. However, this year's spring plowing production is facing difficulties. This is not only because this year's agricultural production tasks have been increased compared to previous years, but also because the preparatory work for spring plowing was not seized tightly in general areas last winter. For example, many areas did not pay attention to accumulating fertilizer, and fertilizer is generally felt to be lacking. Some areas did not carry out winter plowing, and the winter plowing work in some areas was very rough. The number of draft animals in some places has decreased compared to previous years. Farmers in disaster areas lack food rations, and during the spring plowing period, they must also use considerable strength to engage in sideline production to prevent possible spring famines. In short, many of the things that should have been done last winter have been delayed for various reasons; if we immediately seize the time and work hard to do them well in the spring, it will not be a major obstacle to this year's agricultural production; if there is any further delay in the spring, it will absolutely not be compensated for in the summer. The agricultural season waits for no one. Do not mistakenly believe that according to the lunar calendar, this year has a leap March, "spring time is long," and "it doesn't matter if spring plowing production work is a little later." Leap March has no impact on the solar terms; the twenty-four solar terms are still the twenty-four solar terms. Lichun and Yushui have already passed, and in the blink of an eye, it will be Jingzhe and Chunfen. The season is really already very urgent. According to the degree of spring plowing preparation work in many areas, it cannot be said that it is still early, but rather that it is already behind the normal year. What is urgently needed now is to make up for the many spring plowing preparation work that should have been done some time ago, and should never be delayed any longer.

The work is very important, the content is very complex, there are objective difficulties, the time is very pressing, and the cadre strength is limited; under these circumstances, many staff members are very likely to feel that the work is too busy and too tight, and fantasize about completing other "time-limited and number-required" work tasks first, and then concentrating on leading spring plowing production. This is of course impossible. All rural work cadres must understand that in leading production, it is often necessary to do several other tasks at the same time. This situation is inevitable for a considerable period of time. This is determined by the changes in economic life during the great period of socialist construction. As far back as the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War, in some areas where the task of fighting the enemy was the most serious, under the busiest and most difficult circumstances, we were still able to break through numerous difficulties and complete both the serious combat tasks and the necessary production tasks. We have a tradition of organizing complex tasks and completing several tasks at the same time. For the victory of socialism, we need to better develop this ability.

Doing several tasks at the same time does not mean that various tasks can be completely paralleled. We must pay attention to grasping and solving the current demands of the masses as the primary task, and complete other tasks in connection with it. Therefore, in the spring, we must regard the production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation as the center of all rural work. We must first invest our strength in this main task and achieve a decisive victory; at the same time, in order to support the masses' production, we should take some time to do a good job in grain work and the purchase and supply of other materials at the same time. Many areas first conducted a comprehensive production mobilization, and at the same time concentrated on completing the legacy tasks of the previous stage in a short period of time, and then divided the battle lines, using the main force to lead mutual aid and cooperation, relying on mutual aid and cooperation to organize the masses to produce; in addition, using a part of the force, combined with the cadres of the grain business department, to organize spring grain supply, dividing the work and concentrating on the general purpose of developing production. This method is applicable in provinces where the unified grain purchase and sales work has been basically arranged. With these two tasks arranged well, the so-called difficulty of arranging tasks is basically solved. The problem lies in ensuring that each battle line has a unified command, and ensuring that each battle line closely cooperates without hindering each other. All work tasks must be completed through the masses and relying on the masses. The leading force can divide the battle lines, but the mass force cannot divide the battle lines in most cases. The various tasks on each battle line often have to be carried out through and rely on the same masses. Dividing the battle lines is only to facilitate the grasp of the situation of various tasks, to study the problems of various tasks, to facilitate unified command, and to focus on the main aspects; in actual action, it is absolutely impossible to mechanically divide the troops and guard the passes, each taking care of its own business, which would offset each other's strength or make the masses at a loss.

Of course, there are still many contents included in production. First, we must consolidate the developed cooperatives well, so that they can quickly establish production order and invest in spring plowing. Second, we must pay attention to helping the masses overcome difficulties in production, such as the difficulties of seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools. We must make special efforts to help solve the difficulties felt by farmers in disaster areas and economic crop areas. Third, a series of technical measures should be carried out, such as spring water conservancy repairs, land consolidation, promotion of new farm tools, and allocation of improved varieties. These measures should be implemented step by step and conscientiously executed by the relevant departments.

Completing this year's agricultural production plan is of utmost importance to completing the entire country's economic construction plan, and doing a good job in spring plowing has a decisive effect on completing the annual agricultural production plan. We must achieve the first victory on this year's agricultural front in spring plowing production. We will surely be able to achieve this victory.

### 论春季农村工作的安排

    论春季农村工作的安排
    在春耕季节到来的时候，怎样安排乡村中的各项工作任务，以便于集中力量组织春耕播种，这是一个极其重要的问题。今年春季，农村工作任务十分繁重。除了春耕播种工作以外，粮食统销、征集兵员、修堤治垸、巩固农业生产合作社、灾区的生产救灾以及其他经济工作，都是重要的政治任务和经济任务，每一项都需要很大的努力才能做好。这些工作都直接连系着农民的切身利益。做好粮食统销工作，才会安定农民的情绪，鼓舞农民的生产积极性，这是毫无疑问的。征集兵员的必要性，大家早已知道了。现在要抓紧时间把它做好；而不应拖延下去，影响春耕播种工作。至于修堤治垸、巩固农业生产合作社和灾区的生产救灾工作，本来就是春耕生产的一部分；这些工作必须做好是容易理解的。
    今年的生产任务的内容显然和过去几年有所不同。过去几年内，有许多事情还没有像今天这样纳入计划经济的轨道，没有实行某些社会主义经济措施，农民的生产和国家的收购、供应的经济措施还没有发生像今天已经采取这些措施以后所发生的新的联系。过去几年内没有这么多的农业生产合作社，农民的生产几乎全部是在个体经济基础上进行的。现在有了包括一千三百多万户的合作社，它们本身的生产需要国家帮助、领导，才能进行得好。这一批合作社已对全国的农业生产发生了巨大的影响，这些合作社如果办得不好，会影响社外农民的生产情绪；这些合作社办好了，可以带动农民发展生产。这就非常明白：现在乡村的农业生产工作的内容不像过去那样单纯了，除了组织群众及时耕作播种之外，办好合作社和办好粮食统购统销（春季主要是统销）以及其他经济工作，如供销合作、信用合作、物资供应等等，都成为组织生产工作的必不可少的内容了。没有统筹安排的办法，主观地希望工作内容单一化是不可能的，这是一方面。另一方面，我们每一个农村工作干部还要明白：在农村中，特别是在春季，必须把生产方面最主要的任务——春耕播种放在第一位。因为全体农户一年的生活全靠生产，而春耕播种是春耕生产最紧要的关头。如果我们的工作脱离了生产，也就脱离了群众。任何工作如果妨碍了农业生产，如果不是和农业生产相结合，而是和它相背离，就是绝对错误的。当前农村中最重要的问题，是不少地区的春耕生产无人过问，任其自流，让本来是服务于生产的其他工作把生产挤掉了，以致春耕生产还没有很好地开展起来。有的人借口工作任务太多，一时摆布不开，把生产放松了。这种现象是非常危险的，必须迅速改变过来，否则就会给全年的农业生产造成不可弥补的损失。
    领导农民完成今年的农业生产计划，是全体农村工作干部对国家工业化事业的重大贡献。现在各省市的农业生产计划都确定了，这些计划都是积极的，充满了进取的精神，证明发展农业生产的重要性已经深入人心，引起了大家的高度重视。但是，订出计划毕竟只是事情的第一步；要把计划变成事实，还需要艰苦的工作和持续的努力。大家知道，我们国家去年和前年的粮棉生产，虽然每年都有发展，但由于自然灾害的袭击，并未按计划完成。这就加重了农产品供不应求的严重性，加重了五年计划后三年的农业生产任务，加重了全体农村工作干部和广大农民的责任。今年是五年计划的第三年，为了支援国家的工业建设，满足全国人民日益增长的需要，争取工农业生产的平衡，我们必须完成和超额完成今年的农业生产任务。但是今年的春耕生产却是有困难的。这不仅因为今年农业生产任务比往年提高了，而且因为去年冬季一般地区都未抓紧备耕工作。例如，许多地区没有注意积肥，肥料普遍感到缺乏。有的地区没有进行冬耕，有的地区的冬耕工作非常粗糙。有些地方的耕畜比往年减少了。灾区农民缺乏口粮，在春耕期间，还必须以相当力量进行副业生产，防止可能发生的春荒。总之，去年冬季应该做的这些事情，由于种种原因已经耽误了不少；如果立刻抓紧时间，在春季努力做好，对今年的农业生产尚无大碍；如果春季再有延误，就绝对不能在夏季得到补偿了。农业季节不等人，不要误以为按照阴历，今年闰三月，“春?子长”，“春耕生产工作迟一些不要紧”。闰三月对于节气并没有什么影响，二十四节还是二十四节。立春、雨水早已过去，转眼就是惊蛰、春分，季节实在已经很紧迫了。按照许多地区春耕准备工作的程度来看，更不能说时间还早，而是已经比较常年落后了。现在迫切需要的是把应当在前些时候就做好的许多春耕准备工作弥补起来，决不应该再拖延下去。
    工作都很重要，内容很复杂，客观有困难，时间非常紧迫，干部力量有限；在这种情况下，许多工作人员极容易感到工作太忙太紧，妄想先把别的
  “有期限、要数字”的工作任务突击完成，然后再一心一意领导春耕生产。这当然是不可能的。全体农村工作干部都要懂得，在领导生产的时候，往往还需要同时作好几种其他工作，这种情形在相当长的时期内是不可避免的。这是伟大的社会主义建设时期经济生活的变化所决定了的。远在抗日战争的艰苦年代，在对敌斗争任务最严重的一些地区，在最繁忙最困苦的情况下，我们还能突破重重困难，既完成严重的战斗任务，又完成必要的生产任务。我们已有组织复杂任务、同时完成几种工作的传统。为了社会主义的胜利，还需要更好地发挥这种本领。
    同时做好几件工作，绝不是说可以把各种工作完全平列起来进行。必须注意把群众当前的要求当作首要的任务抓紧解决，联系完成其他任务。因此在春季必须把互助合作为中心的生产运动当作全部乡村工作的中心。要首先在这个主要的任务上投放力量，取得决定性的胜利；同时为了支持群众生产，应当抽出一定时间，把粮食工作和其他物资的收购供应工作同时做好。许多地区首先全面进行了生产动员，同时集中在一个短时期内将上一阶段的遗留任务结束，然后划分战线，用主要的力量去领导互助合作，依托互助合作组织群众生产；另外用一部分力量，结合粮食业务部门的干部，组织春季粮食供应，分工进行而又集中在发展生产的总目的上。这种办法在粮食统销工作大体有了初步安排的省份，都是适用的。这两项任务安排好了，所谓安排任务的困难也就基本上解决了。问题在于必须保证各个战线有统一的指挥，保证各个战线密切配合而不互相掣肘。各项工作任务都要通过群众、依靠群众来完成。领导力量可以划分战线，群众力量在大部分情况下却不能划分战线。各个战线的各项工作往往要通过和依靠相同的群众。划分战线只是为了便于掌握各项工作的情况，研究各项工作的问题，便于统一指挥，突击主要的方面；在实际行动中，决不可机械地分兵把口，各不相顾，那样就会互相抵消力量，或者使群众无所适从。
    当然，在生产方面还是包括着许多内容的。第一，必须很好地巩固已发展起来的合作社，使它们能迅速建立生产秩序，投入春耕。第二，要注意帮助群众克服生产上的困难，例如种子、肥料、农具的困难等等。对于灾区和经济作物区农民所感到的困难，要特别努力帮助他们解决。第三，要进行一系列的技术措施，如水利春修，整理土地，推广新式农具，调配优良品种等。这些措施都应由有关部门切实地、一件一件地安排实施步骤，认真执行。
    完成今年的农业生产计划对于完成整个国家的经济建设计划有极重要的意义，做好春耕工作对于完成全年的农业生产计划又有决定性的作用。我们必须在春耕生产中取得今年农业战线上的第一个胜利。我们一定能够取得这个胜利。
