    Inviting Peasants to Evaluate Handicraft Products

    In early February, the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Junxian County, Henan Province, held an appraisal meeting for handicraft products in Saotou Village. The heads of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team leaders, and experienced elderly farmers were invited. These people, who had been working in agriculture for many years, naturally began to evaluate the 43 types of agricultural tool samples organized and processed by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Hu Jinming, the head of the Shiyang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, looked at a rake carefully and said, "The 'corner locks' of this rake are too small at both ends. They will definitely break when hit by something hard. They would be more durable if they were bigger." Someone pointed to a wheat shovel and said, "The front of this wheat shovel is too shallowly angled, making it difficult to follow the ridges when shoveling wheat; the shovel handle isn't round, so it can't be secured firmly." Everyone chimed in with their opinions, offering a total of thirty-two suggestions. The director of the District Supply and Marketing Cooperative thought to himself after hearing everyone's opinions, "No wonder the agricultural tools processed in the past were piling up; it turns out we weren't acting according to the opinions of the masses!" Wang Jintong, the leader of the ironware production group, said, "After hearing the opinions of the peasant brothers today, I realize that in the past, I was like sitting in the clouds, not grounded at all. It would have been so much better if we had held this meeting earlier. In the future, we must produce according to everyone's opinions and needs, and improve the specifications and quality of our products."

    请农民鉴定手工业品
    二月初，河南省浚县第二区供销合作社在扫头村举办了一个手工业产品鉴定会。农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长和生产上有经验的老年农民被请来了。这些做过多年庄稼活的人，看着供销合作社组织加工的四十三种农具的样品，自然而然地就品评起来了。石羊村农业生产合作社社长胡金明站在一盘耙跟前看了又看，他说：“这耙的‘锁角’两头太小，硬东西一撞就非坏不可，要是再大一些就受使了。”有人指着麦铲说：“这麦铲前面斜的太轻，铲麦时把不着垅；铲把不圆，安不牢把。”大家你一言我一语，总共提出了三十二条意见。区供销社主任听了大家提的意见，心里想：“怪不得过去加工的农具光积压，原来是没有按照群众的意见办事呀！”铁业生产小组的组长王金同说：“今天听了农民弟兄的意见，想起我过去真像坐在云彩里一样不蹬底。早开这个会有多好呀，以后我们一定要按大家的意见和需要来生产，提高产品的规格和质量。”
