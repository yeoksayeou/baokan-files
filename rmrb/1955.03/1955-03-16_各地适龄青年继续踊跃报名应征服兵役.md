Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Throughout the country, a vast number of eligible young people are continuing to actively enlist for military service. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province as of early March, over 90% of eligible youths have signed up for enlistment, exceeding the province's planned recruitment target by more than 17 times. In Shenyang City and its four suburban districts in Liaoning Province, the number of people who have signed up for enlistment exceeds the planned recruitment quota by 21 times. In coastal areas such as Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, over 90% of eligible youths have also signed up for enlistment. In Huangyan County, many eligible youths who participated in supporting the front lines during the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island have actively signed up to enlist.

The vast number of eligible youths in various places have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm in enlisting. In Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, the hometown of Huang Jiguang, the special-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the number of eligible youths who have signed up for enlistment exceeds the planned recruitment number by more than 14 times. Ye Huazhou, an eligible youth in Zhongjiang County, wrote eight consecutive applications to enlist in the military and encouraged eight eligible youths in the village to sign up together. They are all determined to learn from the hero Huang Jiguang and strive to become heroic soldiers defending the motherland. In Macheng County, Hubei Province, three brothers, Yuan Gongxue, Yuan Gongde, and Yuan Gongshu, vied with each other to serve in the military; in the end, the three brothers went to sign up for enlistment together. Feng Baoshan, an eligible youth in Enping County, Guangdong Province, had originally planned to get married recently, but in order to first fulfill the glorious duty of defending the motherland, he discussed it with his fiancée and postponed the wedding. Influenced by the letter of encouragement from Deng Fangzhi, the mother of hero Huang Jiguang, to all eligible youths in the province, and her exemplary action of personally sending her youngest son, Ji Shu, to sign up for enlistment, there were more than 400 cases throughout Zhongjiang County where parents sent their sons and wives sent their husbands to sign up for enlistment.
