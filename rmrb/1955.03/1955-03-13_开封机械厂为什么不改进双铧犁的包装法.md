To the Editorial Department:

    The double-share plow is a farming tool favored by the broad masses of farmers. The national plan for this year is to promote 400,000 double-share plows in rural areas. The transportation of these double-share plows from factories to rural areas will add a serious task to the busy transportation lines. Therefore, improving the packaging and transportation of double-share plows has become an important issue in reducing costs and saving national transportation capacity.

    The double-share plow has different protruding parts on all four sides, occupying a large area of the freight car, while the weight cannot fully load the car, resulting in a serious waste of transportation capacity. The double-share plows produced by the Kaifeng Machinery Factory can only load a maximum of 90 plows per 30-ton freight car, and sometimes as few as 73. On January 24th of this year, 80 double-share plows shipped from Kaifeng to Xiaying, Shaanxi, filled a freight car with an actual weight of only 7,680 kilograms. According to railway regulations, when the load does not reach the marked weight of the vehicle after filling, the freight is charged at half the marked weight (15 tons). This wasted 7 tons of carrying capacity, amounting to 677,460 yuan in old currency. In January of this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative transported a total of 1,020 double-share plows, occupying 12 freight cars, wasting over 8 million yuan in old currency in freight charges.

    Can this waste be avoided? According to the preliminary packaging improvement experiment conducted by the Kaifeng Railway Station and the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the volume of the double-share plow can be compressed from 1.15 cubic meters to 0.32 cubic meters. In this way, a freight car can load more than 260 plows, and 1,020 double-share plows would require a maximum of four freight cars. If the railway saves one freight car, calculated at a savings of 2.19 million yuan in old currency, this batch of double-share plows could save the state 17.52 million yuan in old currency. In this way, freight and freight cars combined could save more than 20 million yuan in old currency. On average, each double-share plow could save more than 25,000 yuan in old currency in railway transportation costs. This year, the Kaifeng Machinery Factory is manufacturing 30,280 double-share plows for the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. If all the packaging is improved, it could save the state approximately 700 million yuan in old currency and free up more than 200 30-ton freight cars for the state to transport other materials. If the packaging and transportation of all 400,000 double-share plows nationwide are improved this year, more than 3,000 freight cars can be saved for the state, with a value of more than 7.5 billion yuan in old currency. If the savings in freight costs are added, it is indeed a huge figure.

    However, the Kaifeng Machinery Factory refuses to improve the packaging method for double-share plows. The Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative began to study this with the factory in January of this year and proposed the requirement to improve packaging. However, the factory emphasized: (1) After the improved packaged double-share plows are transported to the rural areas and reassembled, they may not achieve the original precision; (2) Improved packaging requires dismantling many parts, and they are afraid of losing them during transportation; (3) Improved packaging requires more skilled workers, and the factory's assembly workshop is weak in manpower and cannot solve the problem. Therefore, they disagreed with improving the packaging method. We have reported to the Henan Provincial Department of Industry for assistance, but there has been no result.

    Can the difficulties raised by the Kaifeng Machinery Factory be overcome? According to the actual disassembly and packaging experiments conducted by the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the improved packaged double-share plows from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory that have already been transported to Henan Province, as long as the factory's products meet the specified standards, the first two problems do not exist; as for the problem of using more skilled workers, according to the current production situation of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, only one skilled worker is needed to guide other workers each day. Obviously, this cannot be the reason why they cannot accept the improved packaging method.

    Now the spring plowing season has arrived. Double-share plows are being transported in large quantities from agricultural machinery factories all over the country to rural areas. We cannot sit idly by and watch the serious waste of state resources continue. It is recommended that the Henan Provincial Department of Industry promptly urge the Kaifeng Machinery Factory to actively improve the packaging method for double-share plows.

### 开封机械厂为什么不改进双铧犁的包装法

    开封机械厂为什么不改进双铧犁的包装法编辑同志：
    双铧犁是目前广大农民所喜爱的农具。全国今年计划在农村推广四十万部双铧犁。这批双铧犁要从工厂运到农村，这就给繁忙的运输线上增加了一项严重的任务。因之，改进双铧犁的包装和装运，就成为降低成本和节省国家运输力的一个重要问题。
    双铧犁的外形，四面都有不同的突出部分，占用货车的面积很大，而重量却不能满载，造成严重的浪费运输力的现象。开封机械厂出产的双铧犁，每一个载重三十吨的车皮，最多装九十部，少的只能装七十三部。今年一月二十四日，从开封运往陕西下营的八十部双铧犁，就装满了一个车皮实重只七千六百八十公斤。按铁路规章规定，货物装满后达不到车辆标记重量时，按标记重量折半（十五吨）核收运费。这样就浪费了七吨载重的运费，计旧币六十七万七千四百六十元。陕西省供销合作社今年一月份共运进一千零二十部双铧犁，占用十二个车皮，浪费运费达旧币八百多万元。
    这种浪费是不是可以避免呢？如果按照开封车站同河南省供销合作社初步试验改进包装的结果，双铧犁的体积可以由一点一五立方公尺压缩到零点三二立方公尺。这样，一个车皮就可以装载二百六十部以上，一千零二十部双铧犁最多用四个车皮。铁路上节约一个车皮按节约旧币二百一十九万元计算，这批双铧犁就可以为国家节约旧币一千七百五十二万元。这样，运费和车皮合起来共可节约旧币二千多万元。平均每部双铧犁在铁路运输方面就可节约旧币二万五千多元。今年，开封机械厂替河南省供销合作社制造的双铧犁达三万零二百八十部，如果全部改进包装，大约可以为国家节约旧币七亿多元，而且可以调出二百多个载重三十吨的车皮为国家运输其他物资。如果今年全国四十万部双铧犁都改进包装运输，可以为国家节约车皮三千多个，价值为旧币七十五亿多元。如果加上运费方面的节约，确是一个巨大的数字。
    但是开封机械厂却拒绝改进双铧犁的包装法。河南省供销合作社今年一月间就开始同这个厂研究，提出改进包装的要求。但是工厂强调：（一）改进包装后的双铧犁运到农村后再安装，可能达不到原来的精密度；（二）改进包装需拆卸很多零件，怕在运输途中丢失；（三）改进包装要多用技术工人，工厂装配车间力量薄弱，无法解决。因此，不同意改进包装法。我们曾经报请河南省工业厅协助解决，但也没有结果。
    开封机械厂所提出的这些困难是不是可以克服呢？根据河南省供销合作社的实际拆卸包装试验，和北京农业机械厂已经运到河南省的改进包装的双铧犁的情况来看，只要工厂的产品符合标定规格，前两个问题都不存在；至于多用技术工人的问题，根据开封机械厂目前的生产情况，每日只要一个技术工人指导其他的工人就可以了。显然，这也不能成为他们不能接受改进双铧犁包装法的理由。
    现在春耕已经到了。双铧犁正从全国各农具厂大量运往农村。我们不能坐视严重的浪费国家资财的现象继续下去。建议河南省工业厅迅速督促开封机械厂积极改进双铧犁的包装法。
