    Su Hua
    Wang Xianglan, saleswoman at the Xinkai Road Department Store in Lüda City.
    I am a saleswoman at the Xinkai Road Department Store in Lüda City, happily serving customers every day. My daughter, Su Hua, is already two years old and is white and chubby. The reason why my child and I can live such a happy life is thanks to our life-saving benefactor, Dr. Na Yima Kaoen. It was he who saved me from a terminal illness.
      On the evening of January 6, 1953, I took the train to Lüshun to visit my parents-in-law. I felt a little dizzy on the train, but I felt more awake after getting off the train and being hit by the wind. When I woke up the next morning, I felt dizzy and my eyes were blurred. I originally had anemia and some neurasthenia, so I thought it was just my old problem and didn't pay attention to it. But as soon as I got out of bed, my legs couldn't support me, and I saw blackness and sparks in front of my eyes, and I couldn't see anything. My mother-in-law quickly helped me onto the kang and asked me what was wrong. At first, I was just swollen all over, had a headache, and blurred vision, but later my hands started to shake, my muscles cramped, I foamed at the mouth, my upper and lower teeth kept clattering, I couldn't breathe, and my whole body turned blue and purple. I completely lost consciousness and fell into a coma. My parents-in-law and others who were present later told me that my father-in-law and neighbors carried me to the hospital. After examination, the doctor determined that I was seven months pregnant and had a very serious case of gestational eclampsia, and there was no hope for my life. However, if a cesarean section was performed to remove the fetus, there was still hope for the baby inside me. Unfortunately, at that time, the Lüshun Municipal Hospital did not have a formal obstetrics and gynecology doctor, and doctors from other departments could not perform this kind of surgery. What to do? If I was sent to a hospital in Dalian by car for surgery, both the baby inside me and I would die halfway. At that time, someone thought of the doctors at the Soviet Army Hospital. My father-in-law said anxiously and sadly, "They are a naval hospital, how can we ask them to treat us?" Everyone said to ask and see, and if they really couldn't come, we would think of another way.
    It was already 11:00 p.m. at that time. After the president contacted the Soviet Army Hospital, they said that the obstetrician and gynecologist, Comrade Na Yima Kaoen, had already gone home. The president called the doctor's home, and Comrade Na Yima Kaoen was already asleep. When he heard that a Chinese woman had a sudden illness, he immediately said, "I'll go right away!"
    It was very cold that day, and the snow was so heavy that you couldn't see the person across from you. The wind was howling. Soon after, the obstetrician and gynecologist, Na Yima Kaoen, arrived at the Lüshun Municipal Hospital. When he arrived, my breathing was already very weak. He walked into the room and asked, "Which ward is the patient in?" He quickly took off his military uniform, put on the hospital's white coat, and without resting, immediately began to diagnose me. After a careful examination, he stood up and said, "The condition is very serious, and surgery must be performed immediately." When he heard the crying outside the ward, he came out and comforted my parents-in-law, saying, "It is right to perform a laparotomy to save the baby, but I will also do my best to save the baby's mother and ensure that both mother and child are safe."
    Dr. Na Yima Kaoen began to perform the cesarean section for me, with Chinese doctors surrounding the operating table to help. Sweat was dripping down his face, and his shirt was soaked with sweat. An hour later, the surgery was over. He walked out of the operating room and shook my parents-in-law's hands tightly, saying, "Mother and child are safe." My parents-in-law were both surprised and delighted, and tears streamed down their faces. They had originally thought that I would not survive and were already preparing for my funeral.
    After the surgery, the Chinese doctors asked Na Yima Kaoen to rest, but he shook his head and said, "No, I can't leave the patient at this time." He carefully examined me again, took my blood pressure, gave me an injection, and told the Chinese doctors: "Enter and exit quietly, without making any noise, strictly disinfect when injecting, keep the room at a certain temperature, and find an experienced head nurse to take care of the patient. In a week's time, the ward must be guarded by someone every minute." He stayed by my side until three o'clock the next morning. Before leaving, he left the phone numbers of the hospital duty room and his home, and said to the Chinese doctors: "Don't forget, tell me immediately if you notice any changes in the patient. No matter what time, I am ready to see the patient at any time." When the Chinese doctors thanked him for saving the patient, he waved his hand and said, "This is everyone's strength. I alone could not have saved the patient."
    He hadn't been back for even three hours, ate something, and rushed back to the hospital again. As soon as he entered the room, he asked the nurse: "How many times a second does the patient breathe, are there any changes, how is the patient sleeping?" The nurse said, "Everything is normal, the patient is sleeping." He was still not at ease and checked my condition with the Chinese doctor. He checked it once and then asked the Chinese doctor to check it again. He also asked the Chinese doctor, "What kind of medicine should be taken for this disease?" The Chinese doctor answered, and he nodded in satisfaction before going to work with peace of mind. After going to work or at home, he constantly called to ask: "How is the patient eating, is the patient sleeping well, is the breathing normal, can the child breastfeed, is there enough milk..." On Sunday, he brought milk and cod liver oil to see me. He gently opened the door, quietly sat on the sofa, first touched his face to test if his hands were cold. After they were warm, he came over and sat on my bed. When I felt someone touching my head, I slowly opened my eyes and vaguely saw a Soviet person smiling at me. The nurse told me, "This Soviet doctor is the one who cured your illness." I was so grateful that tears flowed from my eyes, and I said "Thank you!" in Russian. He comforted me and said, "Don't talk, don't be sad, I understand your feelings completely. Close your eyes, don't think about anything, your child is very well. Rest well, listen to the nurse, your illness will get better soon." He also said jokingly, "When your child grows up and gets married, be sure to tell me, and I will go to drink wedding wine."
    Under the kind care of Dr. Na Yima Kaoen and the Chinese medical staff, my illness was cured after forty days. When I was about to be discharged from the hospital, Dr. Na Yima Kaoen came to see me again. At that time, I said to him, "I really don't know how to thank you enough!" Dr. Na Yima Kaoen smiled and said, "I have three wishes that I hope you will remember: First, come to my house often to play after you get well; Second, return to your work post, obey the Party's assignments, and do your job well; Third, raise your child well so that she will become a good socialist citizen in the future." I said emotionally, "I will definitely remember your words!"
    Back at home, my parents-in-law were so happy that they cried. In order to never forget Dr. Na Yima Kaoen's life-saving grace, the whole family named my daughter "Su Hua" to express the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.
    On February 19th of this year, I took Su Hua to Lüshun to see Dr. Na Yima Kaoen. As soon as we entered the house, Dr. Na Yima Kaoen picked up Su Hua and kissed her again and again. He said happily, "Su Hua is white and chubby, that's great, that's great!" Su Hua grinned and innocently shouted, "Soviet Army Uncle!"
    When we were leaving, Dr. Na Yima Kaoen kissed Su Hua's red cheeks over and over again, and also gave Su Hua some toys, and sent us off very, very far.
    On the way home, I kept thinking: Why are the Soviet troops so kind to us? During the days when the people of Lüda and the Soviet troops got along, the seeds of friendship were spread everywhere. There were more than ten thousand similar things that I experienced! Whenever I see Soviet people, I feel very close, as if I have seen my own family. Isn't this kind of feeling very natural? When celebrating the glorious Soviet Army Day, I told the story of Su Hua's birth so that everyone would know and let the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples deepen and expand!

    苏华
    旅大市新开路百货商店营业员　王湘兰
    我是旅大市新开路百货商店的营业员，每天愉快地为顾客服务着；我的女儿苏华已经满两周岁了，长得又白又胖。我们母子俩所以能够幸福地生活着，不能不万分感激救命恩人——那意玛考恩大夫。就是他，把我从绝症中挽救过来了。
      一九五三年一月六日晚间，我坐火车到旅顺去看望公婆，在车上头就有点迷糊，下了车叫风一吹倒清醒了些。第二天早晨起来，就感觉头昏眼花，我本来有贫血病，还有些神经衰弱，我认为又是老毛病，就没放在心上。谁知刚一下地，两只腿就站不住了，眼前黑忽忽的直冒火花，什么也看不见了。我老婆婆连忙把我扶上炕，问我怎么的了。起初我只是全身浮肿，头痛，两眼昏花，后来就手发抖，肌肉痉挛，嘴吐白沫，上下两排牙齿不断地磕打，气也喘不上来了，别得全身都变成了青、紫色，完全失去知觉，昏迷不醒。听我公婆和当时在场的人以后告诉我，当时我老公公和邻居把我抬到了医院，经大夫检查断定我已怀孕七个月，这次得的是非常严重的妊娠子痫，性命已经没有希望了，但如果实行剖腹取子的手术的话，体内的婴儿还有得救的希望。谁知偏偏赶上那时旅顺市立医院没有正式的妇科大夫，别科大夫又不能动这种手术。怎么办呢？如果用汽车把我送到大连的医院动手术，我和体内的婴儿一定会在半途中死掉。当时有人想起苏军医院的大夫，老公公又着急又难过地说：“人家是海军医院，怎么能请来给咱治病呢？”大伙说请请看，实在不能来再想别的办法。
    那时候已经是晚上十一点钟了，经过院长和苏军的医院联系，说是妇科大夫那意玛考恩同志已经回家了，院长又往大夫家里打电话，那意玛考恩同志已经睡觉了，当他听说有个中国妇女得了急病，马上说：“我立刻就去！”
    那天很冷，大雪下得对面不见人，风刮得呜呜叫。不大一会儿，妇科大夫那意玛考恩来到了旅顺市立医院。当他赶到的时候，我的呼吸已经很微弱了。他走进屋里就问：“患者在哪个病室？”他急忙脱下军衣、换上了医院的白大衣，也顾不得休息，立刻就开始给我诊断，经过仔细检查，他站起来说：“病情是很严重的，必须马上动手术。”当他听到病室外面的哭声时，走出来安慰我公婆说：“开腹拯救婴儿是应该的，不过我还要尽我所有的力量使婴儿的母亲脱险，让她们母子平安。”
    那意玛考恩大夫开始给我动剖腹手术，中国大夫围在手术台旁帮助。他脸上的汗珠直往下淌，他的衬衣已经被汗湿透了。一个钟头以后，手术完了，他从手术室里走出来，紧紧握着我公婆的手说：“母子平安。”我的公婆又惊又喜，热泪直流，他们原先认为我不能活了，已经在为我准备后事了。
    动完手术之后，中国大夫请那意玛考恩去休息，他摇摇头说：“不行，在这个时候我不能离开病人。”他又仔细地进行了检查，给我量血压、打针，又告诉中国大夫：出入时要轻轻的，不要有响动，注射时要严格消毒，屋子里要保持多少温度，要找一个有经验的护士长看护病人，在一个星期内病室里一时一刻也不能断人看护。他一直在我身旁看护到第二天早晨三点钟，在临走时，又把医院值班室和他家里的电话号码都留下了，他对中国大夫说：“千万别忘记，发现患者有什么变化时马上告诉我，不管什么时候，我随时随地都准备来看病人。”当中国大夫感谢他救活了病人时，他摆摆手说：“这是大家的力量，我一个人是不可能把病人救活的。”
    他回去还不到三个钟头，吃了点饭又赶回医院来了，进屋他就问护士：病人一秒钟呼吸多少次，有什么变化没有，睡觉怎么样？护士说：“都很正常，病人正在睡觉。”他仍不放心，和中国大夫一起检查我的病，他检查一遍，又让中国大夫检查一遍，他又问中国大夫：“这种病需要吃什么药？”中国大夫回答了，他满意地点点头，才放心地去上班了。他每天上班后或在家里，总不断地来电话问：病人吃饭怎么样，睡觉好不好，呼吸是否正常，小孩会不会吃奶，奶够不够……在星期天，他又带着牛奶、鱼肝油来看我，他轻轻地拉开门，悄悄地坐在沙发上，先用手摸摸自己的脸，试试自己的手凉不凉，等暖和过来后，才走过来坐在我床上。当我感到有人在摸我的头时，我慢慢睁开了眼睛，模模糊糊看到一个苏联人在向我微笑，护士告诉我：“你的病就是这位苏联大夫给治好的。”我感激得流出了眼泪，用苏联话说了声“谢谢！”他安慰我说：“不要讲话，不要难过，你的心情我完全知道。把眼闭上，什么也不要想，你的小孩很好。好好静养，好好听护士的话，你的病很快就会好的。”他又半开玩笑地说：“等你的孩子长大结婚时，一定告诉我，我去喝喜酒。”
    在那意玛考恩大夫和中国医务人员的亲切照顾下，过了四十天，我的病痊愈了。当我要出院的时候，那意玛考恩大夫又来看我，当时，我对他说：“我真不知道怎样感谢您才好！”那意玛考恩大夫笑着说：“我有三个希望请您记住：第一，您病好后常到我家来玩；第二，回到工作岗位上服从党的分配，把工作做好；第三，把孩子抚养好，使她将来成为社会主义的好公民。”我感动地说：“我一定记住您的话！”
    回到家里，公婆都高兴得哭了。为了永远不忘那意玛考恩大夫的救命之恩，全家人给我的女儿起了个名字叫“苏华”，以表示中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。
    今年二月十九日，我抱着苏华到旅顺去看那意玛考恩大夫，一进屋，那意玛考恩大夫就把苏华抱起来，吻了又吻，他高兴地说：“苏华长得又白又胖，太好了，太好了！”苏华裂着小嘴，天真地喊着：“苏军叔叔！”
    临走的时候，那意玛考恩大夫一遍又一遍地亲着苏华的红脸蛋儿，还送给苏华一些玩具，把我们送出很远，很远。
    在回家的路上，我反来复去地想：苏军为什么对我们这样亲？旅大人民和苏军相处的日子里，友情的种籽撒遍各地，像我经历的类似事情何止万千！我每逢见到苏联人，就感到十分亲切，就像见了自家人一样。这种感情不是很自然的吗？在庆祝光荣的苏军建军节的时候，我把苏华的诞生经过讲出来，让所有的人都知道，让中苏两国人民的友谊更加加深和扩大！
