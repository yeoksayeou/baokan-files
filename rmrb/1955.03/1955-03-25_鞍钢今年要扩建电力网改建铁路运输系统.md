Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 24th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company will construct many substations and transmission lines in 1955 to meet the needs of new factories. Most of the substation construction projects can be completed within the year. The Anshan Second Magnetic Separation Plant, Anshan Second Sintering Plant, Dagushan Ore Dressing Plant, and the reconstructed Dagushan Iron Mine, which will be put into operation in 1955, will be able to obtain sufficient power from these newly built substations.

    According to the blueprints in the hands of the designers, the scale of these substations is rare in our country. One of the substations has enough power to supply a large city with a population of over two million. The design of these substations was mostly done by our country's designers, and most of the equipment is also supplied domestically.

    While building substations, a huge automated thermal power station is also being built in the Anshan Power Plant. After this thermal power station is completed, it will ensure that the main plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel can continue to produce normally even without external power sources, and it can also supply a large amount of low-pressure steam to various plants of Anshan Iron and Steel. Construction of this thermal power station began last year and is expected to generate electricity officially in the first quarter of next year.
Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 24th: The railway transportation system of Anshan Iron and Steel Company will be reconstructed in 1955 in accordance with long-term construction plans. New stations will be built or expanded near various main plants and mines. Currently, road construction workers have begun to reconstruct three stations within the factory area. Preparatory work is also underway for the construction of a station with ten lines, and construction is scheduled to begin in April. Various highly efficient cranes and car dumpers will also be installed at some stations or lines for loading and unloading raw materials and products in order to improve loading and unloading efficiency and reduce train stop time. Weighbridges will also be installed at some larger stations. The weighbridge's indicator panel is located in the station, so when the train passes over the weighbridge line, people can know its weight without leaving the station. Anshan Iron and Steel's existing warehouses will also be adjusted to accommodate the reconstruction of the railway lines.

    After these projects are basically completed by the end of this year, all the lines in the Anshan Iron and Steel factory area will form a dense circular network. Some trains will bring in large amounts of ore and coking coal from outside the factory area, while other trains will transport various steel products and other finished products from inside the factory area, avoiding the congestion that often occurs when vehicles collide with each other. At that time, although the length of the railway will be the same as it is now, its transportation capacity will be three times greater than it is now.

    鞍钢今年要扩建电力网改建铁路运输系统
   【新华社鞍山二十四日电】鞍山钢铁公司在一九五五年内将要建设许多变电所和送电线路，供应新的工厂的需要。变电所的建设工程大部分可以在年内完工。将在一九五五年投入生产的鞍山第二磁选场、鞍山第二烧结场、大孤山选矿厂和改建后的大孤山铁矿等，就可以从这些新建的变电所得到充足的电力。
    从设计师手中的图纸看来，这些变电所的规模在我国是少有的，其中有一个变电所容纳的电力，足可供给二百多万人口的大城市使用。这些变电所的设计，大部分是由我国的设计人员做的，大部分设备也是国内供应的。
    在建设变电所的同时，鞍钢发电厂里还在建设一个巨大的自动化的热电站。这个热电站在建成后，将保证鞍钢主要厂矿在没有外来电源的情况下也可以照常生产，而且可以供应鞍钢各厂大量的低压蒸气。这个热电站从去年已经开始建设，预计明年第一季度可以正式发电。
   【新华社鞍山二十四日电】鞍山钢铁公司的铁路运输系统，一九五五年要按照长远的建设计划进行改建。在各个主要厂矿附近，要建立或扩建新的车站。现在，筑路工人已开始改建厂区内的三个车站。一个拥有十条线路的车站的施工准备工作也正在进行，准备在四月份开始施工。在装卸原料和产品的一些车站或线路上，还要安设各种效率很高的起重机和翻车机，以便提高装卸工作效率，减少列车停车时间。在一些较大的车站，也都要安设地磅。地磅的指示牌设在车站里，当列车从地磅线上驶过时，人们不出车站就能知道它的重量。鞍钢现有的仓库也要进行调整，以便适应铁路线的改建。
    这些工程今年年底基本上完成后，鞍钢厂区的所有的线路将组成密集的环形网。一些列车从厂区外把大量的矿石和炼焦煤载进来，另一些列车就把各种钢材和其他成品从厂区内运出去。避免了像现在车辆经常碰在一起的拥塞现象。那时，虽然铁路的长度和现在相等，可是它的运输能力却要比现在增大三倍。
