Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th. Moscow's major newspapers published articles on the 12th commemorating the 30th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death.

　　"Pravda" published an editorial entitled "Outstanding Chinese Revolutionary Democrat," which detailed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary experience and his main ideas. The editorial stated that great changes have taken place in China since the day Sun Yat-sen, the outstanding Chinese political activist, the passionate fighter for China's freedom and independence, and the loyal friend of the Soviet Union, passed away. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have won great victories and overthrown the rule of feudal and imperialist forces in China. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to resisting these two forces. The Chinese Communist Party accepted the best aspects of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine and led the masses of the people against feudal and imperialist oppression. The Chinese Communist Party is good at applying the theory of Marxism-Leninism to its own national environment, leading the cause started by Sun Yat-sen to victory, and further developing it - building its own country along the socialist road. The Soviet people, like the Chinese people, solemnly commemorate Sun Yat-sen, the great son of the Chinese people and an outstanding revolutionary democrat who fought for the freedom and independence of his motherland throughout his life.

　　"Izvestia" published an article by Rogov entitled "The Great Chinese Revolutionary." The article, in discussing the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, said that Sun Yat-sen wisely foresaw that the world's first socialist country would always be the selfless and loyal friend of the Chinese people. Sun Yat-sen's name is linked to the beginning of the history of Sino-Soviet friendship. This friendship has blossomed into flowers of happiness for peaceful mankind in our time.

　　"Labor News" published an article entitled "Outstanding Revolutionary Democrat." The article stated that Sun Yat-sen knew his people very well, respected his talented and hard-working people, and firmly believed in the ultimate victory of his people. Now Sun Yat-sen's ideals have become a reality. The Soviet people will cooperate closely with the fraternal Chinese people and contribute their share to building the best monument to commemorate Sun Yat-sen - building a socialist society in China.

　　"Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article entitled "The Great Son of the Chinese People." After introducing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's multifaceted revolutionary activities, the article stated that the Chinese Communists are the true successors to Sun Yat-sen's cause. The Chinese Communists applied Marxism-Leninism to China's specific environment, not only realizing Sun Yat-sen's will for China's prosperity and strength, but also going far ahead.

　　"Red Star News" and "Literary Gazette" published commemorative articles written by Bogusevich and Zaslavsky respectively. Zaslavsky said that Sun Yat-sen's name - the name of an outstanding revolutionary democrat - is loved and respected by all progressive mankind.

    莫斯科各报撰文纪念孙中山逝世三十周年
    【新华社莫斯科十三日电】莫斯科各主要报纸在十二日发表文章，纪念孙中山先生逝世三十周年。
      “真理报”发表了题为“杰出的中国革命民主主义者”的社论，详细地介绍了孙中山先生的革命经历和他的主要思想。社论说，从中国卓越的政治活动家、争取中国自由和独立的热情的战士、苏联的忠实的朋友——孙逸仙逝世的那天起，中国已经发生了巨大的变化。在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民已经获得了伟大的胜利，推翻了封建势力和帝国主义势力在中国的统治。孙逸仙曾经贡献出自己的一生来反抗这两种势力。中国共产党接受了孙逸仙学说的最好的方面，领导人民群众反对封建主义和帝国主义的压迫。中国共产党善于把马克思列宁主义的理论运用到自己国家的环境中，把孙逸仙所开始的事业引向胜利，而且更进一步向前发展——沿着社会主义道路建设自己的国家。苏联人民和中国人民一样，隆重纪念中国人民伟大的儿子、为祖国的自由和独立而奋斗终生的杰出的革命民主主义者孙逸仙。
      “消息报”发表了罗果夫的题为“伟大的中国革命家”的文章。文章在谈到中国和苏联的友谊时说，孙逸仙英明地预见了世界上第一个社会主义国家将永远是中国人民的无私的忠实的朋友。孙逸仙的名字是和中苏友谊历史的开始年代联系在一起的。这种友谊在我们的年代里已经开遍了和平人类的幸福之花。
      “劳动报”发表了题为“卓越的革命民主主义者”的文章。文章说，孙逸仙十分了解自己的人民，尊崇富有天才和热爱劳动的自己的人民，深信自己人民的最终的胜利。现在孙逸仙的理想已经变成了事实。苏联人民将同兄弟般的中国人民密切合作，贡献出自己的一分力量，以建造纪念孙逸仙的最好的纪念碑——在中国建设社会主义社会。
      “共青团真理报”发表的题为“中国人民伟大的儿子”的文章。这篇文章在介绍了孙中山先生多方面的革命活动后说，中国共产党人是孙逸仙事业的真正继承人。中国共产党人把马克思列宁主义运用到中国的具体环境中，不仅实现了孙逸仙的关于中国富强繁荣的遗嘱，而且已经远远地走到前面去了。
    “红星报”和“文学报”分别刊载了博古谢维奇和萨斯拉夫斯基所写的纪念文章。萨斯拉夫斯基说，孙逸仙的名字——卓越的革命民主主义者的名字，受到全体进步人类的爱戴和崇敬。
