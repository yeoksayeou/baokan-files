Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Along with the development of China's economic construction, China's female workforce is growing and strengthening. According to statistics, women workers account for more than 60 percent of the total workforce in the national textile industry. In Chongqing's textile industry, women workers account for 70 percent. Currently, the proportion of women of all ethnic groups participating in industrial production in Xinjiang Province has increased more than sevenfold compared to 1950. In Shenyang City, the number of female employees participating in industrial production in 1954 was more than 47,600, an increase of 4.3 times compared to 1949. The number of female employees in heavy industry, basic construction, and transportation is also increasing. In the past, there was not a single female worker in Shanghai's machinery industry system, but now female workers account for 6.9 percent of the total number of employees. In 1954, the number of female railway employees nationwide increased fivefold compared to the early days of liberation in 1949.

    Female employees are distributed in various job positions. Many capable women have been promoted to leading cadres and technicians in factories and mines. Beijing has twenty-two female factory directors and deputy directors.

    Female employees have demonstrated high levels of labor enthusiasm and creativity in production. Liu Peiling, a female worker at the Fushun Open-Pit Mine, invented an "automatic winding machine," increasing production efficiency by nine times. In the textile industry, the average value created by each female worker in 1954 was more than 160 million yuan (old currency), an increase of 10.81 percent compared to 1953, exceeding the production tasks assigned by the state. Yong Lan, a female worker in the lubricating oil industry at the Anshan Iron and Steel Second Thin Plate Plant, was originally a sixth-grade student, but after more than half a year of technical study, she can now operate independently, and even the most complex static oil engines can be disassembled and installed by herself. Due to their selfless labor, many labor models and advanced producers have emerged among female employees. In 1954, Beijing selected thirty-eight female workers as municipal-level labor models, an increase of one and a half times compared to the number of female labor models in 1953.

    With the development of production, the living and welfare benefits of female workers have also improved significantly. At present, there are 4,443 nurseries in the trade union systems of factories and enterprises across the country, with more than 135,400 children being cared for. After the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, by the first half of 1954, more than 1.6 million female workers and family members of employees nationwide had received maternity allowances.

    我国女工队伍日益发展和壮大
    据新华社讯：我国女工队伍随着祖国经济建设的发展，正日益发展和壮大起来。据统计，在全国纺织工业中，女工占百分之六十以上。重庆市纺织工业中的女工占百分之七十。目前新疆省各族妇女参加工业生产的比一九五零年增加了七倍多。沈阳市在一九五四年参加工业生产的女职工有四万七千六百多名，比一九四九年增加了四点三倍。重工业、基本建设、交通运输方面女职工人数也日益增多。过去上海市机械工业系统中没有一个女工，现在女工已占职工总数的百分之六点九。一九五四年全国铁路女职工比一九四九年解放初期增加了五倍。
    女职工们分布在各种不同的工作岗位上。很多有能力的妇女被提升为厂矿企业的领导干部和技术人员。北京市有二十二个女厂长和副厂长。
    女职工们在生产上都表现出很高的劳动热情和创造性。抚顺露天矿女工刘佩玲创造了“自动卷线机”，提高生产效率九倍。在纺织工业中，一九五四年每个女工所创造的价值平均为一亿六千多万元（旧币），比一九五三年增长了百分之十点八一，超额完成了国家所给予的生产任务。鞍钢第二薄板厂女润滑油工业永兰原是一个六年级的小学生，但是经过半年多的技术学习，现在已可以独立操作，连最复杂的静油机也都可以自己拆卸、安装了。女职工们由于忘我的劳动，出现了很多劳动模范和先进生产者。北京市一九五四年评选为市级劳动模范的女工有三十八名，比一九五三年的女工模范人数增加了一倍半。
    随着生产的发展，女工的生活福利待遇也有了显著改善。现在，全国工厂、企业等工会系统的托儿所已有四千四百四十三所，受托儿童有十三万五千四百多个。劳动保险条例实行后，到一九五四年上半年为止，全国女工和职工家属已有一百六十多万人领取了生育补助费。
