    News of Implementing the "Three Fixes" for Grain Reaches the Suburbs of Zhengzhou
    By Our Correspondent Lü Jianzhong
    When over a thousand village cadres and agricultural production cooperative chairmen in the suburbs of Zhengzhou were meeting to discuss how to improve spring production and strive for a great victory on the agricultural production front in 1955, the news of implementing the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain arrived. Everyone was excited. They read again and again the People's Daily editorial "Rapidly Publicize the 'Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, and Fixed Sales' of Grain to All Peasants."
    "Hurry back to publicize it; this method is exactly what the peasants want!"
    "Now we know the bottom line; the more grain we produce, the more we keep!" People discussed excitedly. A township cadre from the GuXing district said, "As long as we announce this 'Three Fixes' method, I guarantee that those peasants who aren't very active in production will immediately send the manure beside their doors to the fields." Ma Junxun, the chairman of the Dongfanghong Second Agricultural Production Cooperative, said, "Implementing the 'Three Fixes' policy will make grain unified purchase and sales work more reasonable, and the peasants' enthusiasm for production will be even greater." During the discussion, everyone felt that implementing the "Three Fixes" policy had many benefits and could also promote the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. The reason is: after the grain production, purchase, and sales are all fixed, the cooperative is superior to individual farming. The more it increases production compared to individual farmers, the more grain it has left, and the better the lives of its members. This will guide the peasants to take the road of collectivization. Yang Peichun, the chairman of the Sanlihe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, and others enthusiastically studied how to increase the yield of wheat in the cooperative from 120 jin per mu last year to 140 jin per mu, how to lead the township's peasants to transform that large area of perennially disaster-stricken waterlogged land, and how to appropriately increase the township's production increase target this year, both to ensure the state's fixed purchase quota of grain in the township and to improve the living standards of the peasants.

    实行粮食“三定”的消息传到郑州市郊
    本报记者  吕建中
    当郑州市郊区一千多个乡村干部和农业生产合作社社长正在开会讨论怎么样搞好春季生产，争取一九五五年在农业生产战线上打一个漂亮仗的时候，实行粮食“定产、定购、定销”的消息传来了。每个人的心都振奋起来。他们一遍又一遍地读着人民日报社论“迅速向全体农民宣传粮食的‘定产、定购、定销’”。
    “赶快回去宣传，这办法正对农民的心思！”
  “这下摸着底了，粮食打的越多，留的越多！”人们兴奋地议论着。古荥区的一个乡干部说：“只要把这‘三定’的办法一宣布，保管那些生产不很积极的农民立刻会把门旁的粪送到地里去。”东方红第二农业生产合作社社长马俊旬说：“实行‘三定’政策，粮食统购统销工作就会做得更合理，农民们的生产劲头就会更大了。”在讨论当中，大家觉得实行“三定”政策有许多好处，还能促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。理由是：以后粮食产购销都定了数，合作社比单干优越，它比单干农民增产越多，自己剩下的粮食也越多，社员生活也越好。这样就会引导农民都走合作化的道路。三里河乡的农业生产合作社社长杨培春等兴致勃勃地研究怎样把社里小麦每亩的产量，由去年的一百二十斤提高到一百四十斤，如何带动乡里农民把那一大片常年遭灾的水洼地改造过来，以及如何适当地提高全乡今年的增产指标，既保证国家在全乡的粮食定购数字，又提高农民的生活水平。
