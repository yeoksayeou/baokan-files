To the women and mothers of the world:

On the occasion of "March 8th" International Women's Day, and coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation extends warm greetings to you, wishing you happiness, wishing your families happiness, wishing you the rights of citizens, workers and mothers, and wishing for peace.

For forty-five years, women have been celebrating "March 8th" in the spirit of international friendship and cooperation. However, this year, mothers feel extremely uneasy because of the threats that loom over humanity. The warmongers are attempting to establish military bases, conclude aggressive treaties, and launch new conflicts in Asia and Europe – and this time, such a conflict is bound to become a world war, and take the form of atomic warfare, bringing tragic consequences to humanity and future generations.

Faced with such dangers, the forces of peace are powerful and growing everywhere. Women play a decisive role in this struggle. They firmly oppose the evil activities of those who prepare for war. Year after year, they recognize their responsibilities and their strength in the struggle they are waging for rights, for the happiness of their families, and for the maintenance of peace.

Women and mothers of the world!

We must unite and fight shoulder to shoulder, regardless of race, political opinion, religious belief, or social background.

To realize our aspirations, to enable every family in every country to live a more reasonable life, fight against high prices, against the reduction of social welfare and heavy taxes; continue to fight for equal pay for equal work, so that the rights of all women in political, social, economic, and family life are fully recognized;

Ensure that the struggle of women in colonial and backward countries to improve their living conditions, to oppose discrimination against women, and to strive for national independence together with the people of the whole country is victorious;

Support the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world, firmly oppose the use and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, and demand that atomic energy be used to promote human progress and welfare;

Ensure that divisions that create estrangement between countries can be discussed with a willingness to resolve them peacefully, just as the Geneva Conference ended the war in Indochina;

Promote universal disarmament and the establishment of friendly relations among all countries.

Women and mothers of the world!

Our actions can determine the future of our families. Let us contribute all our strength and resolutely make the World Mothers' Congress a success. This Congress will express our indomitable will to save the lives of our children and defend peace.

Let us celebrate "March 8th" as a day of struggle and hope. We, our actions, our passion, and our unity will determine whether a period of decisive victory in the struggle for women's rights, children's happiness, progress, and peace will be possible before all mankind.

    纪念“三八”国际妇女节
    国际民主妇联告全世界妇女书全世界的妇女和母亲们：
    值此“三八”国际妇女节，又适逢今年国际民主妇女联合会成立十周年，国际民主妇女联合会理事会谨向你们致以热烈的敬礼，并祝你们快乐，祝你们全家幸福，祝你们能获得作为公民、劳动者和母亲的权利，并祝和平。
    四十五年以来，妇女一直是在国际友谊和合作的精神下庆祝“三八”节的。然而今年，由于威胁笼罩着人类，母亲们都感到极大的不安。战争制造者企图以建立军事基地，缔结侵略性条约，在亚洲和欧洲发动新的冲突——而这次，这种冲突必定会成为世界性的冲突，并采取原子战争的形式，给人类及子孙后代带来悲惨的后果。
    面临着这样的危险，和平的力量到处都是强大的，而且日益增长。妇女们在这一斗争中起着有决定意义的作用。她们坚决反对那些战争准备者的罪恶活动。她们一年比一年认识到在她们所进行的争取权利、争取她们家庭幸福和维护和平的斗争中她们的责任和她们的力量。
    全世界的妇女和母亲们！
    我们不分种族、政治见解、宗教信仰和社会背景，必须团结起来，并肩斗争。
    为实现我们的愿望，使每个国家的每个家庭都能过更合理的生活，反对物价高涨，反对减缩社会福利和沉重的赋税而斗争；继续为争取同工同酬，从而使一切妇女在政治、社会、经济上和家庭生活中的权利获得充分承认而斗争；
    保证殖民地和落后国家的妇女为争取改善生活条件、反对歧视妇女以及和全国人民一起争取民族独立而进行的斗争获得胜利；
    支持世界和平理事会的号召，坚决反对使用和制造大规模毁灭性武器，要求将原子能用来增进人类的进步和福利的告全世界人民书；
    保证使各国发生隔阂的分歧能够在抱着和平解决的意愿下予以讨论，正如在日内瓦会议上结束了印度支那的战争一样；
    促使各国普遍裁减军备，建立友好关系。
    全世界的妇女和母亲们！
    我们的行动能够决定我们家庭的前途。让我们贡献出一切力量，坚决开好世界母亲代表大会，这次大会将表达出我们拯救我们的孩子的生命和保卫和平的不屈不挠的意志。
    让我们将“三八”节作为一个斗争和充满希望的日子来庆祝。我们，我们的行动，我们的热情和我们的团结将决定在全人类面前是否会有可能出现一个争取妇女权利、儿童幸福、进步和和平的斗争取得决定性胜利的时期。
