Improving Saline-Alkali Wasteland by Sowing Alkali-Resistant Crops
    The employees of the three state-owned mechanical farms in Shanyin, Gao Cun, and Jieyu in Shanxi Province will create wealth worth 264,100 yuan for the country this year on the saline-alkali wasteland after preliminary improvement. These days, the Shanyin and Gao Cun farms are using machinery to sow spring wheat, and 1,250 mu of wheat fields will be planted by the end of March. Alkali-resistant crops such as sorghum, corn, sunflowers, and beans, as well as a large number of amorpha fruticosa needed for soil improvement, will also be sown soon. Workers at the Jieyu Farm are applying top dressing to 1,300 mu of winter wheat fields. This farm will also sow 800 mu of cotton in early April.
    These three mechanical farms are located beside the Hutuo River, Sanggan River, and Sushui River in northern and southern Shanxi. The land where the farms were built is low-lying, and it is all saline-alkali water and wasteland. Before and after the establishment of the Shanyin and Gao Cun farms last year, some wasteland was reclaimed and improved, and green manure crops such as alfalfa and amorpha fruticosa, which are beneficial to soil improvement, were planted. This year, the sowing area of these three farms will increase from more than 3,000 mu last year to more than 15,000 mu, and they will continue to reclaim wasteland and improve the soil.

    改良盐碱荒滩播种耐碱作物
    山西省山阴、高村和解虞三个国营机械农场的职工，今年要在经过初步改良后的盐碱荒滩上，为国家创造二十六万四千一百多元的财富。这几天，山阴、高村两农场正用机械播种春小麦，一千二百五十亩麦田到三月底便可种完。高粱、玉米、向日葵、豆类等耐碱作物和改良土壤需用的大量紫穗槐，不久也要播种。解虞农场的工人们正在一千三百亩冬小麦田上加施追肥。这个场还要在四月初播种棉花八百亩。
    这三个机械农场分别建立在晋北滹沱河、桑干河和晋南涑水等河边。建场的土地地势低洼，都是一片片的盐碱水滩和荒草滩。去年山阴、高村两场建场前后，就开垦并改良了一部分荒地，种植了对改良土壤有好处的苜蓿、紫穗槐等绿肥作物。今年这三个农场的播种面积将由去年的三千多亩增加到一万五千多亩，并将继续开垦荒地和改良土壤。
