    The people of all countries have long seen through the so-called "democratic politics" of the United States. More than a year ago, U.S. Senator Lehman, after visiting Western Europe, lamented: "Many people in Europe regard us as a country shrouded in the shadow of bankrupt Fascism." The recent revelation of perjury by the U.S. government-employed "informant" Matusow in anti-communist "trials" further exposes the ugly face of American-style "democracy."

    Since 1951, when Matusow became a "informant" employed by the U.S. government, he has been highly valued by the U.S. government's Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House Un-American Activities Committee. He frequently testified in U.S. courts at all levels, the government's Subversive Activities Control Board, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the House Un-American Activities Committee, and other institutions. No fewer than two hundred progressives have been subjected to judicial persecution by the U.S. government as a result of his "accusations" and "testimony." Two years ago, the U.S. Federal Court sentenced thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party to prison on charges of so-called "conspiracy to incite the overthrow of the U.S. government," also based primarily on Matusow's "testimony." Because in the dirty dealings of judicial persecution, he catered to his masters' wishes and sold his soul, he was once praised by Senator McCarthy and lauded as "a great American." The U.S. Department of Justice even kept this "experienced witness" on the payroll with a monthly salary and allowances of more than one thousand U.S. dollars.

    However, to the surprise of these gentlemen, this "testimony expert" they cherished recently made his "testimony experience" public. Matusow wrote a book called "False Witness." In the book, he admitted that his past testimony in various anti-communist "trials" was fabricated. Regardless of the background of Matusow's confession, it cannot but give the U.S. ruling clique a major headache. Because in this way, the U.S. government's past behind-the-scenes judicial persecution of many communists and progressives has been exposed at once.

    What made the U.S. government even more embarrassed was that Matusow not only admitted that his past testimony was fabricated, but also stated that those false testimonies were fabricated under the direct instruction and instigation of the U.S. judicial authorities and McCarthy. He said that he sometimes fabricated "testimony" in the prosecutor's office and sometimes in McCarthy's hotel room. "These testimonies are not based on facts, but only for the purpose of interrogation." He specifically mentioned how U.S. Assistant Attorney General Cohn instructed him to give false testimony in the Foley Square trial of the thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party. He said: "These testimonies were completely fabricated to create some false impressions." In fact, until now he has "not found any conspiracy of the Communist Party." Matusow also admitted that he was instructed to engage in the same kind of frame-up in the persecution of American labor leader Jencks and the persecution of American Far East expert Lattimore. Matusow also gave false testimony in McCarthy's book-burning case. He said that McCarthy often provided him with fake documents and encouraged him to make more anti-communist accusations.

    In this way, Matusow's confession not only exposes the darkness of the U.S. judicial system, but also exposes the U.S. ruling clique's despicable tricks in carrying out political persecution. The U.S. government has made buying perjury the main means of framing peaceful and democratic people, and the judicial authorities have played a shameful role in it. Obviously, Matusow is only one of the many "informants" and "false witnesses" kept by the U.S. government. U.S. Attorney General Brownell has publicly recruited U.S. citizens to engage in the side business of informing against democratic and progressive movements. He once said to college students: "You usually have some free time and would like to earn some money. On the other hand, there are extremely harmful ideas in your universities. Monitoring them will be an interesting pastime for you, and it can also bring you generous rewards... Go to the police station to apply..."

    Now, the U.S. ruling authorities are trying their best to cover up the scandal revealed by Matusow. On the one hand, the U.S. Supreme Court does not recognize Matusow's testimony as false and rejected the appeal of the thirteen American Communist leaders for a retrial; on the other hand, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee is coercing Matusow. This false witness, who once received many rewards for fabricating perjury, is now being prosecuted for "perjury" as soon as he tells the truth and admits that he committed perjury. Walter, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and others even basely tried to portray the matter as follows: Matusow has always been a tool of the American Communist Party planted in the U.S. government, and the Communist Party wants to use his perjury and retraction to destroy the prestige of U.S. anti-subversion activities. The reactionary forces in Washington are trying to use this despicable method to cover up the incident and launch a new anti-communist frenzy. The U.S. authorities are planning new judicial persecutions against American Communist leader Eugene Dennis and others, who will complete their sentences on March 1, in order to put them back in prison.

    However, no matter what conspiracies and tricks the U.S. government authorities use, they cannot hide it from the eyes and ears of the world. The anti-democratic crimes of the U.S. ruling clique revealed by the Matusow incident have aroused the indignation of honest people in all countries. The U.S. government can fabricate new perjury to throw communist leaders back into prison and continue to carry out fascist judicial persecution against American progressives, but they will not escape the condemnation of world public opinion and the final punishment.

    美国司法当局反民主的丑行
    钟和
    各国人民早已看透了美国的所谓“民主政治”是什么东西了。一年多以前，美国参议员利曼访问过西欧之后就曾感慨地说：“欧洲许多人都把我们看作是已经被破产的法西斯主义阴影所笼罩的国家。”最近被揭露出的美国政府雇用的“告密者”马图索在反共“审讯”中作伪证的事，更加暴露了美国式“民主政治”的丑恶面目。
    马图索从一九五一年起充当了美国政府雇用的
  “告密者”之后，非常受到美国政府联邦调查局和国会非美活动委员会的赏识。他经常在美国的各级法院、政府的颠覆活动管制局，参议院的国内安全委员会、常设调查小组委员会、众议院的非美活动委员会等机构中作证。曾经有不下二百个进步人士由于他的“告发”和“见证”遭到美国政府的司法迫害。两年以前，美国联邦法院以所谓“阴谋教唆推翻美国政府”的罪名对十三位美国共产党领导人判决徒刑，也是以马图索的“证词”作为主要根据的。由于他在司法迫害的肮脏勾当中，屈意仰承主人的鼻息，出卖自己的灵魂，他曾经得到参议员麦卡锡的赞誉，被褒奖为“一个伟大的美国人”。美国司法部并以每月一千多美元的薪金和津贴豢养这名“有经验的证人”。
    但是，出乎这些老爷们的意外，他们所宠爱的这个“作证专家”最近忽然把他的“作证经验”公之于世。马图索写了一本叫“假证人”的书。他在书中承认了他过去在各次反共“审讯”中的作证都是虚构捏造的。不论马图索这一自白的背景如何，它不能不使美国统治集团大伤脑筋。因为这样一来，美国政府过去对许多共产党人和进步人士的司法迫害的黑幕一下子被揭穿了。
    更使美国政府感到狼狈的是：马图索不仅承认了他过去所作的证词都是捏造的，而且说出了那些假证词是在美国司法当局和麦卡锡的直接指使和教唆下捏造的。他说他有时候是在检察官的办公室、有时候是在麦卡锡的旅馆房间里编造“证词”。“这些证词并不是根据事实，而只是为了审讯的目的。”他特别谈到美国司法部助理检察官柯恩在迫害美共十三位领导人的福莱广场审讯中如何指使他作假证。他说：“这些作证完全是捏造出来制造一些虚假的印象”，事实上，直到现在他并“没有发现共产党有任何阴谋”。马图索还承认在迫害美国工会领袖简克斯和迫害美国远东问题专家拉铁摩尔等案件中，也受指使作过同样的陷害勾当。马图索在麦卡锡的焚书案中也作过伪证。他说麦卡锡经常给他提供假文件，并鼓励他多作反共诬告。
    这样，马图索的自白就不仅揭发了美国司法制度的黑暗，而且暴露了美国统治集团进行政治迫害的卑劣伎俩。美国政府已把收买伪证作为陷害和平民主人士的主要手段，而司法当局在其中扮演了可耻的角色。很显然，马图索只不过是美国政府所豢养的许许多多“告密者”和“假证人”中的一个。美国司法部长布朗纳尔就曾公开招揽美国公民从事反对民主进步运动的告密“副业”。他有一次对大学生们说：“你们平常总有些空闲的时间并也颇想赚些钱吧。在另外一方面，在你们大学里有极大危害性的思想。对他们的监视，将是你们有趣的消遣，并且还可以使你们得到丰厚的报酬……到警察局去应征吧……”
    现在，美国统治当局正在想尽办法来掩饰马图索所揭露的丑事。一方面美国最高法院不承认马图索的作证是虚假的，拒绝了十三个美共领导人要求重新审判的上诉；另一方面，参议院国内安全小组委员会对马图索进行逼供。这个曾经因为编造伪证而得到许多奖赏的假证人今天刚一说了真话，承认自己作了伪证，就要被以“伪证罪”起诉了。非美活动委员会主席华尔特等人更卑劣地想把事情说成是这样：马图索一直就是美国共产党安插在美国政府中的工具，共产党是要利用他的伪证和翻供来破坏美国反颠覆活动的威信。华盛顿的反动势力想用这种卑鄙手法来把事件遮掩过去，并掀起一次新的反共狂潮。美国当局正在策划对三月一日服刑期满的美国共产党领导人尤金·丹尼斯等进行新的司法迫害，来把他们重新关进监狱中去。
    但是，不管美国政府当局使用什么样的阴谋诡计，他们都无法掩尽世人的耳目。马图索事件所揭发的美国统治集团的反民主罪行已引起世界各国正直人民的愤慨。美国政府可以制造新的伪证把共产党领袖重新投入监狱并对美国进步人士继续进行法西斯的司法迫害，但是他们将逃不掉世界公正舆论的谴责和最后的惩罚。
