    The Current French Political Situation and the Paris Agreements
    Ling Qihan
    Since the fall of the Mendès-France cabinet on February 5th, the French government crisis has continued for nineteen days. It wasn't until the failures of the attempts by Pinay, Pflimlin, and Pineau to form a cabinet that Edgar Faure finally formed the twenty-first cabinet in France since 1945.

    It is worth noting that although the French constitution, just revised in November 1954 for the convenience of bourgeois rule, simplified the procedure for forming a cabinet and reduced the "absolute majority" required for parliamentary authorization to a "simple majority," it still failed to shorten the duration of the government crisis, indicating that the instability of the French government has other fundamental reasons. Since May 1947, when the French ruling clique excluded the Communist Party from the government and accepted the Marshall Plan, it has blindly pursued a war policy dependent on the United States. In June 1951, it forcibly reduced the number of Communist Party members in the National Assembly from 167 to 96 by tampering with the electoral law. As a result, the will of the people could not be fully reflected within the parliament. However, outside the parliament, throughout the country, the democratic and national unity of the French people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and based on the united front of the working class, has grown stronger with the expansion of world peace forces. The strength of the French people has now developed to such an extent that not only the working class, but also voters from a wide range of social strata have been drawn into the wave of opposition to the Paris Agreements, preventing the French ruling clique from easily implementing policies that would harm the country and the people by following the United States. This has led to increasingly large divisions and contradictions within the various bourgeois parties, fueled by the surging power of the people. Thus, an insurmountable gap exists between the will of the people and the policies of the ruling clique. This gap is the root cause of the instability of the French government.

    The characteristic of the changes in the French political situation since the fall of the Laniel-Bidault government last June, as French Communist Party member Farge recently stated: "As long as the government's actions conform to the will of the people, the majority in parliament and the stability of the government are easily resolved. But if it violates the will of the people, the government will tend to collapse." Last June, when Mendès-France formed his cabinet, he obtained a majority of 419 votes to 47 in the National Assembly. The Indochina armistice agreement last July even received an unprecedented majority of 471 votes to 14 in the National Assembly. However, since the signing of the London Agreements last October, his majority in parliament has been shrinking. Even after exhausting despicable and dirty means to pass the Paris Agreements on December 30th of last year under extremely heavy and crude pressure from the United States and Britain, he only obtained a weak majority of 287 votes to 260, until he collapsed on February 5th during the debate on North African policy, failing to even obtain the simple majority required for confidence. This shows that although the French state apparatus is controlled by the ruling clique of the big bourgeoisie, if it blindly relies on the United States and supports the rearmament of West Germany, the French government's crisis will inevitably occur frequently. This was true in the past, and it will be true in the future. The fall of the Mendès-France cabinet is a vivid lesson.

    However, the French ruling clique will not learn a lesson from this government crisis. The statement by the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party on February 5th pointed out early on that "the bourgeoisie is trying to bring those who will implement the same policies into the government in order to resolve this cabinet crisis." Now they have done so. Faure, who served as Prime Minister for five weeks in 1952 and then continuously participated in the Laniel-Bidault cabinet and the Mendès-France cabinet, serving as Minister of Finance, is a figure with strong pro-American leanings. He has wooed the Gaullists, his own Radical Party, the Independent Republicans, the Democratic Social Resistance Alliance, and the Popular Republican Movement and other right-wing parties. His cabinet is a patchwork of eight parties. The well-known figures of Binet of the Independent Republicans, Boucher-Maunoury of the Radical Party, Robert Schuman, Pflimlin, Deixonne of the Popular Republican Movement who firmly advocate the rearmament of West Germany have all become the pillars of the Faure cabinet. Therefore, it is foreseeable that his government will soon follow in the footsteps of Mendès-France. The Socialist Party, although not participating in the Faure cabinet, just as it did not participate in the Mendès-France cabinet, will continue to adopt a "small scolding, big help" strategy to support the policy of relying on the United States and ratifying the Paris Agreements.

    In his speech to the National Assembly on the formation of his cabinet, Faure bluntly announced that he would continue the policies of Mendès-France, and he made it clear that he would urge the Senate of the Republic to quickly ratify the Paris Agreements. After successfully forming his cabinet, he quickly met with the US and British envoys to assure them. He appointed Binet as Minister of Foreign Affairs, because Binet is said to be able to directly control the largest parliamentary group in the Senate's 319 seats, including the 84 seats of the Independent Republicans, the "Moderate Alliance". The Communist and Progressive members of the Senate are in a tiny minority, so Faure expects Binet to play a leading role in the Senate's debate on the Paris Agreements. At Faure's urging, the Senate is scheduled to debate the matter on March 22nd.

    The French people have long recognized that the struggle against the Paris Agreements is a long-term, repeated, and fierce struggle. The French Communist Party also called on the people as early as January 27th to shift the spearhead of opposition to the Paris Agreements from the National Assembly to the Senate of the Republic. The call also pointed out that provincial elections will be held in April this year, and half of the Senate members will be re-elected in June by the newly elected provincial councils. The Communist Party has decided to nominate candidates in each constituency and, based on the results of the preliminary elections, support candidates from any other party who openly and consistently advocate peace and oppose the rearmament of West Germany. Voters from all walks of life in France have organized themselves and are visiting and petitioning provincial and senators. Several patriotic senators have indicated that they will vote against the Paris Agreements.

    The recently revised constitution adopts the so-called "shuttle system between the two chambers." A bill passed by the National Assembly must be reviewed by the Senate. As long as the Senate passes any amendments, the original bill must be sent back to the National Assembly for a second reading. Once the two chambers "travel back and forth" in this way, the bill can wander around for one hundred days from the second reading onward. Only then can the National Assembly make a final decision.

    Recent signs indicate that the Senate is brewing several amendments. The Industrial Production Committee has already passed an amendment to the Saar Agreement. Michel Debré, the rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee, is said to be proposing in his report that approval of the Paris Agreements be conditional on seeking negotiations with the Soviet Union, Germany guaranteeing its agreement with France's interpretation of the Saar Agreement, and the gradual establishment of an armaments integration agency for the Western European Union. It is known that the United States and Britain are firmly opposed to negotiating with the Soviet Union before the Paris Agreements are ratified and implemented, the Saar issue has always been a seed of discord between France and Germany, and the issue of armaments integration agencies is a symptom of serious contradictions among the military-industrial monopoly capital groups of various countries. These possible amendments are formed on the basis of these internal contradictions within imperialism. As long as one of a series of amendments is passed, the Paris Agreements ratification bill must be sent to the National Assembly for a second reading. Therefore, the struggle launched by the French people with the support of international peace forces, coupled with the internal contradictions between imperialism and the bourgeoisie, could send the Paris Agreements ratification bill into the "two-chamber shuttle system" for a journey. The government crisis in France has already disrupted Dulles' "ratification timetable." If the French people achieve new successes in the Senate struggle, then new prospects may appear for the struggle against the Paris Agreements.

    However, the imperialist war group has recently become more frantic. The US and British imperialists are not only determined to rearm West Germany in the West, but also recklessly obstructing our liberation of Taiwan in the East. British Prime Minister Churchill's atomic saber-rattling has surpassed the originally advocated "policy of strength" and further promotes a "policy of deterrence." It must be pointed out that due to the arrogance of the war group and the fact that the Paris Agreements have been passed by the Bundestag, US and British imperialism will exert extraordinarily brutal pressure during this debate in the French Senate. This will inevitably remind people of the situation after the National Assembly once rejected the rearmament of West Germany on December 24th of last year. The New York Herald Tribune shamelessly revealed on December 27th: "Work to overturn the rejection and change 21 or more votes is being conducted on an individual basis with members of parliament." The methods used are nothing more than bribery, intimidation, enticement, coercion, and other despicable tricks. Recently, French progressive newspapers have revealed some ugly details. In this Senate debate, US and British imperialism and a small group of French monopoly capitalists will collude with each other, adopt a strategy of divide and conquer, just as they did with the National Assembly, and use sugar-coated bullets to attack the Senate. Therefore, people must be vigilant and must also consider that in the extremely sharp struggle between peace forces and war forces, the struggle against the Paris Agreements may also suffer setbacks. Should this happen, the French Communist Party has already stated that even if the Paris Agreements are ratified, the French people's struggle against the rearmament of West Germany must continue.

    As for peace-loving countries, they will never be caught off guard if the final ratification and implementation procedures of the Paris Agreements are completed. Foreign Minister Molotov clearly pointed out in his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 8th: "Once the Paris Agreements are ratified and implemented, one cannot fail to fully assess their adverse and directly dangerous consequences." Then, in the same excellent report, he also pointed out the various "corresponding measures" that the Soviet Union and European peace-loving countries should take.

    目前的法国政局和巴黎协定
    凌其翰
    自二月五日孟戴斯—弗朗斯内阁垮台后，法国政府危机持续了十九天，直到比内、普夫朗朗、比诺各人组阁失败以后，埃加·富尔才组成一九四五年以来法国第二十一任内阁。
    值得注意的是：一九五四年十一月刚修改的法国宪法为了资产阶级统治的便利，简化了组阁的程序并且把议会信任授权所需要的“绝对多数”减低为“简单多数”，仍未能缩短政府危机的时间，可见法国政府的不稳定性另有它的基本原因。法国统治集团自从一九四七年五月把共产党排挤出政府，接受了马歇尔计划以来，一味奉行依附美国的战争政策，一九五一年六月又借窜改的选举法硬把国民议会一百六十七位共产党议员减少为九十六位，以致在议会以内人民的意志不能获得充分的反映，但在议会以外，在全国范围内，法国人民在共产党领导下，以工人阶级统一战线为基础的民主和民族大团结却随着世界和平力量的扩大而日益壮大起来。目前法国人民的力量已经发展到这样程度，即不仅工人阶级，而是全国广泛阶层的选民都已卷入了反对巴黎协定斗争的浪潮，使法国统治集团不能轻易地执行跟随美国来祸国殃民的政策，并使资产阶级各党派内部随着人民力量的汹涌澎湃而滋生日益扩大的分歧和矛盾。人民意志和统治集团的政策之间就这样存在着不可逾越的鸿沟。这条鸿沟也就是法国政府不稳定性的根源。
    自从去年六月拉尼埃—皮杜尔政府倒台以后，法国政局的变化所表现的特点，正如法共议员法戎最近所说：“只要政府的行动符合于人民的意志，议会中的多数和政府的稳定，就容易解决，但若违反人民的意志，政府就要趋于崩溃。”去年六月孟戴斯—弗朗斯组阁时在国民议会获得四百十九票对四十七票的信任多数，去年七月印度支那停战协定更获得国民议会四百七十一票对十四票的空前多数，但自去年十月伦敦协定签订后，他在议会中的多数却日益减缩，连去年十二月三十日为了通过巴黎协定，在美英极其沉重而粗暴的压力下，施尽了卑鄙龌龊的手段以后，也只获得二百八十七票对二百六十票的微弱多数，一直到二月五日在北非政策辩论中，连信任所需的简单多数也得不到而垮台。由此可见，法国国家机器虽为大资产阶级统治集团所操纵，但若一味依附美国，支持武装西德，法国政府的危机就不可避免地要频繁出现。不仅过去如此，以后还将如此。孟戴斯—弗朗斯内阁的垮台就是一个活生生的教训。
    然而法国统治集团是不会在这次政府危机中吸取教训的。二月五日法共政治局声明早就指出“资产阶级企图把那些将执行同样政策的人弄到政府中去，这样来解决这次内阁危机。”现在他们就这样办了。一九五二年曾任总理五星期，以后连续参加拉尼埃—皮杜尔内阁和孟戴斯—弗朗斯内阁，迭任财政部长的富尔，是带着浓厚的亲美色彩的人物。他拉拢了戴高乐派、自己的激进党、独立共和党、民主社会抵抗联盟和人民共和党等右翼各党。由八个党派七拼八凑组成了他的内阁。独立共和党的比内、激进党的布歇—莫努里、人民共和党的罗伯·舒曼、普夫朗朗、戴尚等这班为众所周知的坚决主张武装西德的人物都成为富尔内阁的支柱。因此，他的政府将会不久蹈孟戴斯—弗朗斯的覆辙，这是可以预料的。社会党虽没有参加富尔内阁，正如它没有参加孟戴斯—弗朗斯内阁一样，将继续采取“小骂大帮忙”的策略来支持依附美国和批准巴黎协定的政策。
    富尔在国民议会的组阁演说中干脆宣布要继续孟戴斯—弗朗斯的政策，他明白指出要促使共和国参议院迅速批准巴黎协定。他在组阁成功后连忙接见美英使节向他们作出保证。他任命比内为外交部长，因为比内在参议院三百十九个议席中，据说能够直接控制包括独立共和党在内的最大党团“温和派联盟”八十四个议席，而参议院中的共产党议员和进步议员都占极少数，因此富尔期待比内对参议院辩论巴黎协定起着推动的作用。在富尔的催促下，参议院已定于三月二十二日进行辩论。
    法国人民早已认识清楚反对巴黎协定的斗争是长期反复的、激烈的斗争，法国共产党也早于一月二十七日号召人民要把反对巴黎协定的矛头从国民议会转向共和国参议院。号召还指出今年四月将举行省选举，六月将由新选的省议会举行参议院议员一半的改选，共产党决定在每一选区提出候选人并根据初步选举的结果，支持其他任何党派公开和坚持主张和平、反对武装西德的候选人。法国各阶层选民已经纷纷组织起来，向省议员和参议员访问请愿，若干爱国的参议员已表示将对巴黎协定投反对票。
    最近修改的宪法采取了所谓“两院往返制”。法案经国民议会通过后须由参议院审议。只要参议院通过任何修正案，原法案就要送回国民议会进行二读，这样两院间“往返旅行”起来，从二读起，这个法案就可徜徉一百天。然后国民议会才能作出最后的决定。
    最近种种迹象表明，参议院正在酝酿出好几个修正案。工业生产委员会已经通过了关于萨尔协定的修正案。外交委员会报告员密歇尔·德勃雷据说将在报告中提出：以设法和苏联举行谈判、德国必须保证同意法国对萨尔协定的解释以及西欧联盟须逐步成立军备统筹机构等作为批准巴黎协定的条件。人们知道，美英坚决反对在巴黎协定批准和实施以前和苏联谈判，萨尔问题始终是法德间不和的种子，而军备统筹机构问题更是各国军火垄断资本集团间严重矛盾的症结。这些可能的修正案就是在这些帝国主义内部矛盾的基础上形成的。只要一系列的修正案有一个获得通过，巴黎协定批准法案就必须交送国民议会进行二读。因此，法国人民在国际和平力量的支持下展开的斗争，加上帝国主义间和资产阶级间的内部矛盾，把巴黎协定批准法案送入
  “两院往返制”的环行路上去旅行，不是没有可能的。这次法国的政府危机已经打乱了杜勒斯的“批准时间表”，假使法国人民在参议院中的斗争获得新的成就，那么，反对巴黎协定的斗争可能会有新的前景出现。
    然而最近帝国主义战争集团更加疯狂了。美英帝国主义不仅在西方坚决要武装西德，并且在东方不顾一切地进行阻挠我解放台湾。英国首相邱吉尔的原子叫嚣已经超越了原来主张的“实力政策”、更进一步鼓吹“威慑政策”。必须指出，由于战争集团的狂妄，更由于巴黎协定已被波恩联邦议院通过，在法国参议院这一场辩论中，美英帝国主义势将展开异常粗暴的压力，使人们不能不回忆到去年十二月二十四日国民议会一度否决武装西德以后的情况。十二月二十七日纽约先驱论坛报竟恬不知耻地透露：“为了推翻否决，改变二十一票或更多票数的工作正在议员的个别基础上进行”。进行的方法不外乎贿买、恫吓、利诱、威逼等种种卑鄙伎俩。最近法国进步报刊已经揭露了若干丑恶的内幕。在这次参议院辩论中，美英帝国主义和一小撮法国垄断资本家一定会狼狈为奸，像对国民议会一样，采取各个击破的策略，用糖衣炮弹向参议院进攻。因此，人们不能不提高警惕，并且不能不估计到在和平力量和战争力量极其尖锐的斗争中，反对巴黎协定的斗争也不是没有遭受挫折的可能。万一如此，法国共产党也已经表示过：即使巴黎协定被批准，法国人民反对武装西德的斗争一定要继续下去。
    至于爱好和平的国家也决不会因巴黎协定最后批准和付诸实施的程序竟告完成而措手不及。莫洛托夫外长早在二月八日苏联最高苏维埃会议的报告中明确指出：“一旦巴黎协定被批准和付诸实施，也不能不充分估计到它的不良的和直接危险的后果。”接着在同一卓越的报告中，他还指出了苏联和欧洲爱好和平的国家应当采取的种种“相应的措施。”
