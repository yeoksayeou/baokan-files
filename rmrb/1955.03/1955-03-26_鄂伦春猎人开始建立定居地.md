    In the Tao'er River basin of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Oroqen people, who have been nomadic hunters for generations, have begun to establish settlements, turning the sparsely populated Wurubutai into a bustling hunter village. The hunters happily moved into new houses, hanging beautiful curtains in front of the bright glass windows; pasting Chairman Mao's portrait on the wall, alongside propaganda posters for forest protection and fire prevention. Every night, they no longer light smoky and unwarm bonfires, but instead light warm stoves in their houses; they no longer use pine torches for illumination, but use hanging lamps and candles. After these hunters settled down, fewer people became sick. Yibujin, a health model of the Autonomous Banner, said: "In the past, when we lived in Xierenzhu (hide tents), our women suffered terribly from the cold when they got sick or gave birth. Everyone says it's good to settle down now." Not long ago, the Autonomous Banner People's Government organized a working group to visit the hunters with cigarettes and alcohol, according to the Oroqen customs, asking for their opinions on settling down. Senbao, an old hunter, said: "This is really a good place, where we can hunt, raise livestock, and grow vegetable gardens. Our children and grandchildren will benefit!"

    鄂伦春猎人开始建立定居地
    在内蒙古自治区鄂伦春自治旗的套勒河流域，世世代代游猎的鄂伦春人，开始建立了定居地，使人烟稀少的乌如布台变成热闹的猎人村庄。猎人们快乐地搬进了新房，在明亮的玻璃窗前，挂上美丽的布帘；在墙上张贴着毛主席像，旁边还贴上一些护林防火的宣传画。每到夜晚，他们不再去燃起又冒烟又不暖和的篝火，而是在屋里生了暖烘烘的火炉；他们也不再用松明照亮，而是用吊灯，蜡烛。这些猎人定居后，生病的人也少了。自治旗卫生模范伊布金说：从前在歇仁柱（皮帐棚）里住的时候，我们妇女得了病或生小孩，可真受不住寒冷的苦，定居了我们人人都说好。不久以前，自治旗人民政府组织了一个工作组，按照鄂伦春人的风俗，带着烟酒去访问猎民们，问起他们对定居的意见。森保老猎人说：这里真是个好地方，又能打猎，又能放牲畜，又能种菜园子，我们的子孙可有好处了！
