Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Across the Country Prepare to Supply Farmers with Large Quantities of Pesticides and Agricultural Machinery

Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are actively preparing and supplying large quantities of pesticides and agricultural machinery to support farmers in eliminating crop diseases and insect pests and striving for increased agricultural production. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives organized twelve state-owned pesticide and machinery factories in August 1954 to produce the pesticides and machinery needed for this year. The country is preparing to supply more than 200 million jin of pesticides such as "666," Ceresan, rotenone, and copper sulfate this year; the "666" alone is 3.6 times more than in 1954. This year, more than 300,000 manual dusters, compression sprayers, single-tube sprayers, and large-scale power agricultural machinery are being prepared, as well as 300,000 sets of parts for repairing agricultural machinery. Since the fourth quarter of 1954, the pesticides and machinery produced by the factories have been continuously transported to rural areas. By mid-February, 20 provinces and cities, including Hebei, Guangdong, Shandong, Liaoning, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Beijing, had already transported more than 38 million jin of pesticides and more than 25,000 pieces of agricultural machinery. Guangdong Province has transferred more than 10 million jin of "666" to various counties and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to actively supply rice seedling fields for stem borer control. Heilongjiang Province has supplied farmers with more than 229,000 jin of Ceresan, which can be used to disinfect more than 1.1 million mu of spring wheat seeds.

In order to help farmers master the technology of using pesticides and machinery, training classes have been opened in various places since February to train cadres who manage pesticides and machinery. At present, 11 provinces and cities, including Shaanxi, Liaoning, Hebei, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hubei, and Shanghai, have trained more than 4,800 technical cadres.

Henan Strengthens the Repair and Assembly of New-Style Farm Tools

As the spring plowing season in rural areas has arrived, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Henan Province and agricultural technology extension stations in various places have begun to increase the number of farm tool repair and assembly stations by more than 400 in areas where new-style farm tools are more widely promoted, such as Anyang, Xinxiang, and Xuchang, using the power of the masses to repair new-style farm tools for farmers. In addition, existing farm tool repair and assembly institutions, as well as technicians from bicycle shops and iron and wood production cooperatives in rural market towns, are organized to go deep into the countryside to carry out roving inspections and repairs and impart technology. Technicians dispatched by the Eighth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xingyang County repaired 24 double-shared plows, walking plows, and weeders for farmers in less than 20 days. Because the farm tool inspection and repair work was done well before spring plowing this year in Tongxu County, most of the thousands of new-style walking plows and double-shared plows of the farmers have been put into production.

In order to solve the supply of parts for new-style farm tools such as double-shared plows and walking plows in a timely manner, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative ordered 31 kinds of parts from the Kaifeng Machinery Factory. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Xinxiang, Anyang, and other regions have transported large quantities of new-style farm tool parts to various places. (Xinhua News Agency)

Yunnan Iron Factory Rushes to Produce 10-Inch Walking Plows

The Yunnan Iron Factory plans to produce 3,000 10-inch walking plows in the first quarter of 1955 for farmers to use during spring plowing. Since January, the factory has made more than 1,000 10-inch walking plows. Inspection and trial use have proved that the quality of these plows is better than that of the plows produced by the factory in the past.

In order to meet the actual needs of rural areas in Yunnan, the workers of the Yunnan Iron Factory are researching and experimenting with using nodular cast iron to replace gray cast iron plowshares and plow supports, and using iron plow beams to replace wooden plow beams. The iron plow beam walking plow is about 10 kilograms lighter than the original walking plow. After these methods were initially trial-produced into several walking plows, they were taken to the countryside for trial use, and the farmers welcomed them very much.

Hubei Provincial Farm Tool Factory Manufactures Large Quantities of Double-Shared Plows

In January and February of this year, the workers of the Hubei Provincial Farm Tool Factory produced more than 6,000 No. 20 new-style walking plows. In order to meet the needs of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and increased agricultural production, the farm tool factory began to trial-produce double-wheeled double-shared plows with deep plowing, wide plowing, and the ability to increase agricultural production. Seventy plows were produced in February and tested seven times in different soil types, proving that the quality and specifications fully meet the prescribed standards, are suitable for use in the province, and have been officially manufactured with the approval of higher authorities.

At present, the Hubei Provincial Farm Tool Factory has made all preparations for manufacturing double-wheeled double-shared plows and is starting mass production on the premise of strictly ensuring quality. It is planned to produce 1,400 double-wheeled double-shared plows in March and April. (Ji Zhuoru)

Guangdong Promptly Rushes to Transport Fertilizer and Seeds to the Countryside

On the crisscrossing rivers of Guangdong Province, thousands of wooden sailing boats, motorboats, and barges carrying spring plowing production materials travel frequently every day. In February alone, the Pearl River Shipping Administration transported more than 79 million jin of chemical fertilizers and bone meal from Guangzhou to Zhongshan, Panyu, Shunde, Dongguan, and other places; it also transported 5.36 million jin of sugarcane seedlings to Guixian County in Guangxi Province. On the South China Sea, freighters carrying spring plowing production materials are also constantly coming and going. In February, the Guangzhou Maritime Transport Administration transported nearly 20 million jin of chemical fertilizers, soybean cake, etc., and more than 70,000 jin of sugarcane seedlings from Guangzhou to Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Haikou, and in early March, it transported more than 600,000 jin of "666" insecticide powder. On the highway transportation lines, many cars are also speeding, transporting large quantities of seeds and chemical fertilizers to remote villages. The Guangzhou General Station of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Transportation Transportation Bureau alone transported more than 1.5 million jin of corn and millet and 12,000 jin of chemical fertilizers.

Hebei Actively Supplies Livestock Fodder to Disaster Areas

In the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province in 1954, livestock fodder was scarce. In order to help farmers solve this difficulty and support spring plowing production, supply and marketing cooperatives actively carried out fodder procurement, regulation, and supply. According to statistics from Tianjin, Cangxian, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang four regions in mid-February, a total of 76.6 million jin of fodder were prepared and have begun to be supplied. The Baoding Regional Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 21 million jin of fodder through purchasing in other places, organizing regulation in various counties, and establishing fodder markets. More than 10 million jin were supplied to farmers. The Tiegan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shenxian County explained to local farmers the significance of selling fodder to support disaster areas, and at the same time adopted the method of exchanging coal for grass. In just three days, it purchased more than 13.7 million jin of grain straw, wheat straw, green grass, and yam vines. (Li Yue)

Agricultural Scientists Go to the Countryside

Spring plowing is about to begin in various places. More than 150 scientists from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute are now going to the countryside one after another to help farmers increase production.

This year, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute has specially organized wheat comprehensive research groups and cotton comprehensive research groups to uniformly guide the institute's experimental research and increased production demonstration work on wheat and cotton in various provinces.

The scientists who are going to work in rural areas this time include experts and technicians in wheat, cotton, miscellaneous grains, animal husbandry, vegetables, meteorology, and other fields. Agricultural scientists who go to Hebei and Shanxi provinces will go deep into the rural areas and agricultural cooperatives in 29 cities and counties to carry out work.

Chen Fengtong, director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and others went to Hebei, Henan, and other provinces in mid-February to participate in the experimental research plan meetings of various provinces in order to better cooperate with each other. (Xinhua News Agency)

Chongqing Factories Go to the Countryside to Exhibit Products

The product mobile exhibition team composed of 33 local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Chongqing recently set off to visit rural areas in various parts of Sichuan. The exhibition team carried more than 600 products of different specifications that are closely related to farmers' current spring plowing production and life, such as new-style walking plows, water pumps, fertilizer bone meal, granular fertilizer, and Chinese-style sweaters. During the exhibition, oil paintings, photos, slides, etc. will be used to introduce the varieties, quality, properties, and uses of these products to rural state-owned commercial departments and the vast number of farmers, so as to facilitate the purchase and use of rural commercial departments and farmers.
