An Important Change
An Gang

After the announcement of the policy of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" in rural areas by the Party and the government, an important change has been triggered in the thinking of cadres, especially the leading cadres of local Party and government organs. To summarize, it can be described as having a clear understanding, comprehensive arrangement, clear boundaries, and everything considered for the sake of developing production.

First, let's talk about having a clear understanding. In the past, Liaoning Province had production plans every year, but not a single year saw the completion of the plan. When making plans each year, the production figures proposed by county and district cadres were always high. They believed that a larger plan would look better, politically motivate the masses with strength, and also allow them to request more loans and allocate more production materials from higher authorities. After these plans were compiled by the provincial leadership organs, they became an extremely large plan. According to this plan, grain in Liaoning Province could increase by 600,000 to 700,000 tons. The provincial leadership organs examined the actual output, public grain income, and grain transferred in over the years, and eventually had to reduce the compiled plan. County and district cadres saw the plan being reduced and thought that "the higher authorities are conservative." This debate between "advanced" and "conservative" could not be resolved for a long time. Now that "fixed production" is implemented, the first task is to require a realistic estimate of agricultural production capacity in the minds of leaders. Because after "fixed production," it is no longer possible to be like the past: "The planned figure is very large, it cannot be completed every year, and the words are not kept." "Calculate it carefully, and don't make big mistakes," is the common cry. From top to bottom, everyone is beginning to calm down. Comrades from the Provincial Party Committee are studying various plans, comparing various figures, and considering the actual output, the guaranteed output, and the output that should be strived for. This method of accounting used by the leading organs is very necessary. From this overall accounting, they discovered some fundamental issues worthy of re-evaluation. First, in terms of output, from 1950 to 1954, the output increased year by year. The output in 1954 exceeded any year in history. This was related to the relatively light flood in Liaoning Province last year, but the most important thing was that rural work was in-depth in 1954, and the unified purchase and sales work was tightened. The output figures were more in line with reality. Starting from this, it can be basically determined that the planned output for 1955 (roughly the guaranteed output of a normal year) should be used to determine the production quota. This will not be too high or too low, and can become the starting point for the production increase campaign. Second, in terms of grain supply, in the past, only some people were heard shouting "tight." This time, after calculating the accounts, it was found that the past estimate of grain shortage in rural areas had a lot of false pretenses. In 1954, the province supplied 300,000 tons of grain to grain-deficient households (excluding farm households in economic zones). At 40 jin per person per month, this is enough for 1.2 million people to eat for a year. There are 11 million farmers growing grain in Liaoning Province. That is to say, excluding the special crop economic zones, there are still nearly 10 percent of grain-deficient households in the entire rural area. This number is large. At the same time, among the grain-deficient households, there are hardly any people who lack grain throughout the year. Some only lack grain for one or two months. Everyone calculated the overall accounts back and forth, and finally came up with a figure close to the actual situation as the basis for guiding "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales." This is an important change in the thinking of the leadership: the thinking of the leading cadres in the counties has also changed. The Party's three-fix policy guides county and district leading cadres to consider the real situation more and to lead the entire production work with a clear understanding. As one county party committee comrade said: "The three-fix policy has made our minds clear." We must abandon the past style of "blowing air bubbles" and lead production concretely from reality.

The second change in the leadership's thinking is to pay more attention to the comprehensive arrangement of various tasks. In the past, the Department of Agriculture led agricultural production increase, the Department of Rural Work rectified mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the Department of Food was responsible for grain collection and storage, and the Department of Commerce was responsible for the unified purchase and sales arrangement of primary markets. It is entirely necessary for various tasks to be divided and taken care of by the relevant departments, focusing on specific tasks. But how can these tasks be organically linked, and how can they advance together under a unified arrangement, for the common goal of increasing production and saving? There have been many problems in the middle of this. Many rural work cadres reflected: "Doing unified purchase and sales, collecting public grain, conscription... can all be regarded as a central task, a shock task, and various forces can be brought together to do it, but when it comes to production, everyone thinks, 'Production is a perennial thing, it doesn't matter if it's put off a bit,' so it can't be brought together." This year, the spring plowing preparation work in many areas of Liaoning Province has not been done well, which is closely related to this kind of thinking. The Party's three-fix policy and the spring plowing production call have basically solved this problem. At the meeting of the Provincial Party Committee to study the implementation of the three-fix policy, they first unified the three aspects of production, purchase, and sales for consideration, and came up with unified solutions. For example, when discussing whether the prescribed total output can be achieved, the issue of rectifying mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas is naturally considered. There are currently 31,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, and the farmers participating in the cooperatives account for 32 percent of the total number of farm households. This organized force will actively respond to the Party's call and create good results for increasing agricultural production, but we must also see the other side, that is, after hanging up the hoe in 1954, many problems left over by the cooperatives have not been resolved. Many cooperatives are only organized in form, and in many places, livestock are entered into the cooperatives, but grass and fodder are not, the phenomenon of livestock deaths and diseases is very serious, and fertilizer accumulation is not as good as last year. These negative factors will bring certain adverse effects to production, so these problems must be solved quickly. At the same time, they reviewed the problems existing in the unified purchase and sales in 1954 and their impact on production. Last year, the unified purchase and sales of grain achieved great results. By the end of February, only 43,000 tons of grain purchase arrears remained in the province, which could be collected soon. However, it is still necessary to estimate the other side. Many places only care about unified purchase and ignore unified sales, which has a certain impact on the farmers' production enthusiasm. In order to do a good job in fixed purchase and fixed sales, we must face up to and solve these problems. How can we make the grain market active? Everyone has given due attention to the primary grain market in rural areas. The primary grain market in Liaoning Province has not yet been restored. In fact, restoring the primary market would be beneficial to alleviating the tense situation formed in individual areas due to certain deviations in the unified purchase and sales work. According to a survey, a small village in Kaiyuan County still has 170,000 jin of surplus grain, and there are many similar situations. This surplus grain can be purchased through the primary market, and it can also be appropriately adjusted for some grain-deficient households. In short, in order to implement the three-fix policy and carry out the rural production increase campaign, it is necessary to carry out work from many aspects, and only through unified arrangements can we do a good job in various tasks and achieve the common goal of increasing production.

Clear boundaries. In the past, when the leading organs were doing a central task, they would mobilize, which was necessary. It played the role of encouragement and calling. However, in the mobilization, the policy boundaries in actual work were often not explained clearly and specifically. Some tasks seemed to be blown up by a gust of wind, and often left many problems afterward. In some places, there were even deviations in the implementation of policies. The Party's three-fix policy helped cadres to clearly draw the policy boundaries in their thinking. On the issue of fixed production, everyone is most concerned about whether the projected total output figure can be realized. Judging from the situation in Liaoning Province, the figure now determined is based on reality, which is lower than the figure proposed by the counties. But to achieve this task, considerable efforts must be made. Can the output be reduced? Everyone unanimously believes that it cannot. Provincial Party Secretary Huang Oudong said, "We must complete this figure and strive to complete more production increase tasks, all of which must be achieved through our hard work." On the issue of purchase and sales, policy boundaries are also stipulated. Some people say: After the implementation of fixed purchase, can each village and each household no longer increase, and what should be done if there is a phenomenon of unequal hardship and enjoyment? Can we add 5% to the purchase task? Everyone thinks it is not possible, saying, "This is the policy." Fixing the purchase figure at the prescribed level will effectively promote the enthusiasm of farmers for production. If some areas have a bumper harvest, then they can act in accordance with the regulations of purchasing 40% of the increased output, so that farmers can freely dispose of the remaining 60%. These policy boundaries have become weapons in the thinking of cadres.

The three-fix policy provides the most powerful conditions for carrying out the production increase campaign in rural areas, and at the same time, it also puts forward new issues for strengthening the Party's leadership over agricultural production and all rural work, that is, everything is considered from the perspective of developing production. The comrades in Liaoning Province believe that the fundamental issue of implementing the Party's policy is to ensure the realization of production increase. At the Provincial Party Committee meeting, everyone studied the issue of planting corn. Corn is a high-yield crop. Its advantages are guaranteed harvest, high yield (an average of 1,000 jin can be harvested from one hectare of land), high rice yield, and a lot of feed. Farmers in Liaoning Province used to grow corn, but due to deviations in the implementation of policies by local Party and government organs in the past, such as not wanting corn for public grain collection, and the unreasonable price difference between corn and sorghum, the farmers did not grow it. In order to meet the requirements of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales," the province must convert and plant 111,000 hectares of corn, which can increase grain production by 61,000 tons. We must also carry out in-depth propaganda and mobilization, correct past deviations from policies, and take various appropriate measures to achieve this task. While studying the implementation of the three-fix policy, the comrades of the Provincial Party Committee believed that it is necessary to carry out a widespread campaign to save grain, first of all, to save grain in urban organs and troops. The Provincial Party Committee took the lead in saving and reducing supplies, and appropriate education should also be carried out for farmers. Everyone also calculated an account: the grain produced in Liaoning Province cannot be self-sufficient, and it still needs a lot of grain to be transferred from the whole country. However, judging from the province's supply standards, they are generally higher than in other places, so it is necessary to educate the people to "eat whatever they have" and reduce grain waste.

In terms of fixed purchase and fixed sales, we must reasonably calculate the needs of people for grain and the feed for livestock and pigs. For example, in the Liaoning area, it is necessary to use a certain amount of grain to feed a fattened pig. Therefore, when implementing the three fixes, it must be calculated in, which can encourage people to raise pigs. In short, in order to develop production, it is necessary to correctly combine the interests of the state with the demands of farmers closely through the form of three fixes. Everything is done in accordance with the Party's policies.

These are some important changes in the thinking of the leadership, which will play a decisive role in the victorious realization of the Party's policies in rural areas.

    一个重要的变化
    安岗
    党和政府关于在农村实行“定产、定购、定销”的政策宣布后，在干部思想、首先是地方党政机关领导干部的思想中，引起一个重要变化。归纳起来，可以说是心中有数、全面安排、界限分明和一切为发展生产着想。
    先说心中有数。辽宁省农业生产过去年年有计划，但是，却没有一年完成过计划。每年作计划时，县区干部提的计划产量数字总是大的，他们认为计划大一点好看些，从政治上动员群众有力量，同时还可以要求上级多发些贷款和多调拨一些生产物资。这些计划经省的领导机关汇总后，就变成了一个极其庞大的计划。按照这个计划，全辽宁省粮食可以增加六、七十万吨。省的领导机关从历年实产量、公粮收入和调进粮食等方面来考察，最后总要把这个汇总的计划削减一些。县区干部看到计划被削减就认为“上级保守”。这个“先进”同
  “保守”的争论，长期得不到解决。现在实行“定产”，第一件工作就是要求在领导思想中，对农业生产能力有一个接近实际的估计。因为“定产”以后，再也不能像过去那样：“订的计划很大，年年完不成，说话不算数”了。“好好算一下，千万不要有大差处”，这是共同的呼声。从上到下，都开始冷静下来。省委的同志，研究各种不同的方案，对比各种数字，考虑实际产量，能够保证的产量和应当争取的产量。领导机关这种算大账的办法是很必要的，从大账中，他们发现一些值得重新估计的根本问题。第一、在产量方面，从一九五○到一九五四年，产量是逐年提高的。一九五四年的产量超过历史上任何一年，这和辽宁省去年水灾较轻有关系，但最主要的是一九五四年农村工作深入了，统购统销工作抓得紧，心中多少比过去有了底，因而就使得产量数字更符合于实际了。由此出发，便可以基本确定：应以一九五五年的计划产量（大体是一般年景的保证产量）来定产。这就不会偏高偏低，就可以成为增产运动的出发点。第二、在粮食供应方面，过去只是听到有些人喊“紧张”。这次一算帐，发现过去对农村缺粮的估计，有着很大的假象。一九五四年全省供应缺粮户（不算经济区农户）的粮食是三十万吨。以每人每月四十斤计，可够一百二十万人吃一年。全辽宁省种粮食的农民有一千一百万人，这就是说，除去特种作物经济区外，整个农村还有近百分之十的缺粮户，这个数字是大的；同时在缺粮户中间，全年缺粮的人几乎是很少的。有的只是缺一个月到两个月的粮食。大家翻来复去算大帐，最后得出一个接近实际的数字，作为领导“定产、定购、定销”的依据，这是领导思想中一个重要的改变：各县领导干部的思想也有了变化。党的三定政策，引导县区领导干部更多地考虑现实状况，心中有数地领导整个生产工作。正像一位县委同志所说的：“三定政策使我们的头脑清醒起来”。必须抛弃过去“吹气冒泡”的作风，从实际出发具体地领导生产。
    领导思想第二个变化是更加注意对各种工作的全面安排。过去是农业厅领导农业增产，农村工作部整顿互助合作组织，粮食厅负责粮食的征收和保管，商业厅负责统购统销安排初级市场等。各种工作应当由有关部门分工负责，重点进行，这是完全必要的。但是怎样使这些工作都能有机地联系起来，在统一安排下，为着增产节约的共同目标齐步前进呢？这中间就曾发生过不少的问题。不少农村工作干部反映：“搞统购统销，征收公粮，征兵……都能当作一个中心工作，一个突击任务，把各种力量捏在一起干，就是搞生产的时候，大家都认为‘生产是常年的事，往后靠一点，没有啥’，就弄不到一块了。”今年辽宁省不少地区备耕工作做的不好，同这种思想大有关系。党的三定政策和春耕生产号召基本上解决了这个问题。在省委研究贯彻执行三定方针的会议上，他们首先把产、购、销三个方面统一起来考虑，想出统一的解决的办法。如在讨论能否达到规定的总产量时，就自然考虑到农村整顿互助合作问题。全省现已有三万一千个农业生产合作社，参加社的农民占总农户百分之三十二，这个组织起来的力量将会积极响应党的号召，为提高农业生产创造出良好成绩，但是也不能不看到另外一面，这就是在一九五四年挂锄后，合作社遗留下不少问题没有得到解决。很多合作社只是形式上组织起来了，很多地方牲口入社，草料不入社，牲口死亡得病现象很严重，积肥不如去年，这些消极因素将给生产带来一定程度的不利影响，因此必须迅速解决这些问题。同时他们检查了一九五四年统购统销中存在的问题及其对生产的影响。去年粮食统购统销取得了极大的成绩，到二月底为止，全省只剩下了四万三千吨的购粮尾欠，很快就可以全部征齐。但是，还必须估计另外一面。许多地方只顾统购、忽视统销，这些对农民生产情绪都有一定影响。为了搞好定购定销，就必须正视和解决这些问题。怎样使粮食市场活跃起来呢？大家对农村初级市场给了应有的重视。辽宁省初级粮食市场至今尚未恢复。其实，恢复初级市场对缓和个别地区因统购统销工作中的某些偏差而形成的紧张形势会有好处。据调查，开原县一个不大的村庄，现在还有余粮十七万斤，类似情形不少。这些余粮可以经过初级市场购买，对一些缺粮户也可作适当的调剂。总之为了执行三定政策，开展农村增产运动，必须从多方面来进行工作，也只有经过统一的安排，才能做好各种工作，达到增产的共同目的。
    界限分明。过去领导机关在做某一项中心工作的时候，就做一番动员，这是必要的。它起了鼓动和号召的作用。但是，在动员时候，往往对实际工作中的政策界限交代得不明确不具体。有些工作像是被一阵风吹起来，过后常常遗留不少问题。有的地方甚至在执行政策上出了偏差。党的三定政策帮助干部从思想上明确地划清了政策界限。在定产问题上，大家最关心的是预计的总产量数字能否实现。从辽宁省情况看，现在确定的数字是从实际出发的，它比各县提出的数字为低。但要实现这个任务，还得付出相当大的努力。能不能减少一些产量？大家对这个问题一致认为，不能。省委书记黄欧东同志说，“我们一定要完成这个数字，还要争取完成更多的增产任务，这一切都要靠我们努力工作来实现。”在购和销的问题上，也规定了政策界限。有人说：实行定购以后，每个村、每一户就不能再增加了，发生苦乐不均现象怎么办？能不能再把收购任务加个百分之五呢？大家认为不行，说，“这是政策”，把收购数字定在规定的水平上就会有力地发挥农民生产积极性。如果有的地区丰收了，那就可以按照收购增产部分百分之四十的规定办事，这样农民还可以自由支配其余的百分之六十。这些政策界限成了干部思想的武器。
    三定政策给农村开展增产运动提供了最有力的条件，同时也为加强党对农业生产和全部农村工作的领导提出了新的问题，这就是一切从发展生产着想。辽宁省的同志们认为贯彻执行党的政策的根本问题是保证实现增产。在省委会上，大家就研究了种玉米的问题。玉米是一种高产量的作物，它的优点是保收，产量大（一垧地平均可收一千斤），出米率高，饲料又多。辽宁省农民过去种过玉米，但因过去地方党政机关执行政策有偏差，如征收公粮不要玉米，玉米同高粱差价规定的不合理等，结果农民都不种了。为了达到“定产定购定销”的要求，全省要改种和多种十一万一千垧玉米，可以增产六万一千吨粮食；又要深入进行宣传动员，从政策上纠正过去偏差，并采取各种适当的措施，就一定可以实现这个任务。在研究贯彻执行三定政策的同时，省委的同志们认为必须开展广泛的节约粮食的运动，首先是在城市机关部队中节约粮食，省委机关带头节约减少供应，对农民也要进行适当的教育。大家也算了一笔帐：辽宁省生产的粮食是不能自足的，它还需要全国调拨很多粮食。但从全省供应标准看，一般都较其他地方为高，因此要教育人民作到“有啥吃啥”，减少粮食浪费。
    在定购定销方面，一定要合理计算人的粮食和牲畜、猪的饲料的需要，譬如在辽宁地区喂肥一口猪一定要用一定数量的粮食。因此，实行三定时就要把它计算进去，这可以鼓励人们养猪。总之，为了发展生产，必须正确地把国家利益同农民要求，通过三定的形式密切结合起来。一切按党的政策办事。
    这是一些领导思想的重要的变化，它将对胜利实现党在农村的政策起着决定的作用。
