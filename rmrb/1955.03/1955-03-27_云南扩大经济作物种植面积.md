    Yunnan Expands Economic Crop Planting Area
    To support industrial construction, Yunnan Province is expanding the planting area of various economic crops this year. Among them, cotton is planned to be planted on more than 349,000 mu, an increase of 25% compared with last year; flue-cured tobacco is planned to be planted on more than 164,400 mu, nearly double the area of last year; sugarcane is planned to be planted on more than 175,000 mu, an increase of 10,000 mu compared with last year; tea production is required to reach more than 10 million jin annually, an increase of more than 1.7 million jin compared with last year. In addition, 20,000 mu of kapok will also be planted.
    The broad masses of farmers are actively responding to the state's call to expand the planting area of economic crops and are actively contracting to plant. For example, in Jiangchuan County, one of the main flue-cured tobacco producing areas, the number of people contracting to plant has exceeded the planned task. Seedlings are now being cultivated in various places in preparation for planting. In the main cotton producing areas of Binchuan, Huaping, Yong Sheng, and Baoshan, between 1,000 and over 9,000 mu of cotton have already been planted; farmers in cotton planting areas such as Dali, Mengzi, and Baoshan are also actively preparing for sowing. Simao Prefecture and Xishuangbanna are regions famous for producing the nationally renowned Pu'er tea. This year, Xishuangbanna alone is expected to increase its tea production by 48% compared to 1950, and 5,000 mu of new tea trees will be planted. The Shuihezhai Sapo and Yakouxinzhaisuore tea gardens on Nannuo Mountain in the area have been deserted for seventeen years, but have now been restored. The masses have great confidence in increasing production.

    云南扩大经济作物种植面积
    云南省为了支援工业建设，今年扩大了各种经济作物的种植面积。其中棉花计划种植三十四万九千多亩，比去年扩大了百分之二十五；烤烟十六万四千多亩，比去年扩大近一倍；甘蔗十七万五千多亩，比去年增加一万亩；茶叶要求年产一千多万斤，比去年增产一百七十多万斤。此外，还将栽种木棉二万亩。
    广大农民都纷纷响应国家关于扩大经济作物栽种面积的号召，积极认种。如烤烟主要产区之一的江川县，群众认种数已超过计划任务。现在各地正在育苗准备栽种。宾川、华坪、永胜、保山等棉花主要产区，已种下一千亩到九千多亩不等的棉花；大理、蒙自、保山等植棉区的农民也正在积极准备播种。思茅专区和西双版纳是盛产全国闻名的普洱茶的地区，今年仅西双版纳产茶量要比一九五零年增加百分之四十八，并新植茶树五千亩，该区南糯山的水合寨萨波，丫口新寨梭惹两家茶园已荒芜了十七年，现在都已修复。群众增产信心很大。
