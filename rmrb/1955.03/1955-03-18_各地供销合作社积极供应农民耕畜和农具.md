Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: Supply and marketing cooperatives across the country are currently adjusting and supplying draught animals in support of spring plowing. Jiangsu, Liaoning, Rehe, Hunan, Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces have successively held special meetings to specifically study and arrange the adjustment of draught animals to support spring plowing. Many provinces are organizing farmers to adjust among themselves through local livestock markets or exchange meetings. By January of this year, Jiangsu Province had already adjusted more than 28,000 draught animals within the province. In Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, more than 300 draught animals were supplied to farmers through the organization of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. Jiangxi Province has organized farmers to adjust more than 24,800 draught animals throughout the province. Hubei Province adjusted 20,000 head of cattle from within the province before spring plowing. Hunan Province also sent more than 1,000 veterinarians to assist farmer representatives in purchasing draught animals in Guizhou and livestock producing areas within the province. Many counties in Sichuan and Jiangxi have established draught animal adjustment markets or stations in areas where there were no livestock markets, to facilitate mutual adjustment among farmers. In addition, provinces with surplus draught animals are also actively adjusting draught animals. Liaoning Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province have signed horse purchase contracts, and sold more than 2,000 surplus donkeys to Gansu. Heilongjiang, Jilin, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also have a batch of surplus draught animals to be transferred to Guannei for supply.

According to Xinhua News Agency: During the spring plowing season, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the country, in addition to supplying farmers with a large number of double-wheel double-share plows and double-wheel single-share plows, are also preparing to supply farmers with seeders, disc harrows, spike-tooth harrows, threshing (grain) machines, weeding hoes, harvesters and various types of waterwheels and other farming and irrigation tools. According to incomplete statistics, supply and marketing cooperatives in eleven provinces, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei, plan to supply a total of more than 500,000 sets of various new and improved farm tools (excluding double-wheel double-share plows and single-share plows) this year, including more than 107,000 weeding hoes, more than 100,000 waterwheels, more than 13,000 seeders, and more than 9,000 harvesters.

Since last winter, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have begun to organize sources of goods. As of February 10, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces had ordered more than 108,000 sets of various new farm tools from various farm tool manufacturing plants; Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other eight provinces have ordered more than 13,000 seeders from Liaoning Farm Tool Manufacturing Plant; Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces have prepared more than 100,000 waterwheels, and other provinces have also made preparations.
