The members of the Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangnan Township, Second District, Rong County, who won the special-class grain increase model of Guangxi Province in 1954, have already engaged in intense spring ploughing and production activities.

When this cooperative was established in February last year, only fifteen farmer households joined. There were a total of more than 75 mu of paddy fields and 17 mu of dry land. Some of the land was very barren and the yield was very low. Since the establishment of the cooperative, due to the concentrated use of labor and the adoption of early sowing and close planting methods, not only have more than 7,500 dan of fertilizer been accumulated, making the amount of fertilizer applied per mu twice as much as in previous years, but also the average yield of rice per mu has reached 972 jin, which is 24% higher than the rice yield per mu of local mutual aid teams. At the same time, the yield of dry land has also increased by more than 40%. Local individual farmers and mutual aid teams have seen the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives with their own eyes and have asked to join the cooperative one after another. Now, as the spring ploughing season arrives, the members of the Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative are actively preparing for spring ploughing, striving for even greater harvests this year.

	Members seize the time to harrow the fields and prepare for sowing.

	The veterinarian from the County People's Government Agricultural Technology Extension Station came to the cooperative to inject cattle with hemorrhagic septicemia (arrow throat) vaccine.

	Members adopt a scientific method of seed selection - salt water selection. This can reduce pests and diseases.

	Pulling out and burning the rice roots can both eliminate rice stem borers and accumulate fertilizer.

	The entire cooperative will repair 63 ponds, which can turn 171 mu of dry land into paddy fields. This is the members digging ponds.

	In order to help members solve technical problems in cultivation, the County People's Government Cultural Center is preparing to show slides related to improved cultivation techniques. This is the members learning the technology of slide projection.

	The mobile water pump sent by the County People's Government is pumping water for the cooperative's rice seedling fields. The People's Bank gave the cooperative a spring ploughing loan of 35 million yuan (old currency). This is Zhong Guangsen, the cooperative's assistant accountant, withdrawing money from the bank.

	The entire cooperative accumulated more than 67,800 dan of fertilizer before spring ploughing. This is the members transporting fertilizer to the fields.

    荣获一九五四年度广西省农业特等粮食增产模范的容县二区厢南乡晓光农业生产合作社的社员们，已经投入紧张的春耕生产活动。
    这个社在去年二月建社的时候，入社的农民只有十五户。共有七十五亩多水田和十七亩旱地。其中一部分土地非常贫瘦，产量很低。自从建社以来，由于集中使用劳动力和采用了早播以及小株密植的耕种方法，不仅积了七千五百多担肥料，使每亩地的施肥量比往年增加了一倍，而且使每亩水稻平均的收获量达到了九百七十二斤，要比当地互助组的每亩水稻产量高出二成四。同时旱地产量也增加了四成以上。当地个体农民和互助组的农民亲眼看到了农业生产合作社的好处，纷纷要求入社。现在，当春耕季节到来的时候，晓光农业生产合作社的社员们正在积极做好春耕工作，争取今年更大的丰收。

    社员们抓紧时间耙田，准备播种。
    县人民政府农业技术推广站派来了兽医给社里的耕牛注射出血性败血症（箭喉）防疫针。
    社员们采用科学的选种方法——盐水选种。这样，就可以减少病虫害。
    把禾根拔出来烧掉，既可消灭螟虫又可积肥。
    全社将要修补六十三个水塘，可使一百七十一亩旱地变成水田。这是社员们在挖水塘。
    县人民政府文化馆为了帮助社员们解决耕作技术上的疑难问题，准备放映有关改良耕作技术的幻灯片。这是社员们正在学习放映幻灯的技术。
    县人民政府派来的流动抽水机正在给社里的育秧田抽水。人民银行给这个社三千五百万元（旧币）的春耕贷款。这是社里的助理会计钟光森正在银行里取款。
    全社在春耕前积肥六万七千八百多担，这是社员们正在往田里送肥料。
