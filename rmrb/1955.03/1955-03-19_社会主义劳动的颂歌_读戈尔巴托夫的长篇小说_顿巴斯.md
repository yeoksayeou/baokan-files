An Ode to Socialist Labor
——Reading Gorbatov's Long Novel "Donbass"
Li Ji

Soviet writer Gorbatov's "Donbass" is a novel depicting the Stakhanovite movement in the Soviet Union in 1935. Through the description of the growth of two young Stakhanovite workers, Andrei and Viktor, it vividly reflects the true face of this movement.

Andrei and Viktor are two ordinary graduates of a seven-year secondary school, but they live in the era of great socialist construction – an era when "people suddenly felt their human strength, the power of their hands, and the effect of collective efforts. Everything was possible: conquering deserts, filling swamps, transforming society, and changing the world" (p. 10 of the original book). In such an era, in the year of the Soviet Union's rapid progress, Andrei and Viktor walked out of school, wandering along the Pushchao River in their hometown of Qibieleji, pondering and arguing about choosing a common path. They are completely different from their parents and grandparents, for whom "poverty decided everything." "Thousands of roads suddenly opened up before them. They could choose any one." And when they hesitated, the socialist motherland and the Communist Youth League chose a path for them – the path of coal miners. These two excellent Communist Youth League members, obeying the mobilization of the organization, abandoned various illusions and embarked on the path of coal miners, becoming the first Stakhanovite workers of the "flower of industry."

However, they did not walk smoothly on this glorious road. They experienced the shattering of illusions in the face of reality, and experienced spiritual cowardice and wavering. They were afraid of the arduous labor of miners, and were even conquered by difficulties. Viktor even became a shameful "flier" (a nickname for "deserters" in the coal mine). Without Andrei's sincere help, Viktor might have embarked on an unforgivable wrong path. Arduous practical work tempered the will of the two young miners. They gradually became skilled miners and outstanding shock workers. They knew all the secrets of the mine, were familiar with every dark corner, and became masters who loved the mine. Their progress in work and their growth in spirit made them dissatisfied with the production volume of their coal mine, dissatisfied with their production quotas, and dissatisfied with the outdated work methods. They demanded to change it in order to achieve higher productivity and mine more coal for the motherland. Based on their mastery of coal mining technology, they enthusiastically sought to improve work methods, from Viktor's bold dreams to Andrei's clear suggestions for the division of labor in the labor organization. Andrei's suggestion stirred up a thrilling struggle in the heart of the calm Maria mine. The proposal caused a huge response: "Seventy tons, seventy tons – the figure boldly put forward by Andrei, jumped before everyone's eyes." (p. 380) Facts proved that it was not only Andrei and Viktor who were dissatisfied with the outdated quotas and ancient work methods. "People turned around on the narrow steps – now they felt the steps were narrower than before – with these numbers in their minds." (p. 380) With the support of the Party and the masses, and inspired by the new record of 102 tons of coal mined by the Stakhanovite workers of the Central Ilmino mine, the miners of Maria were even more enthusiastic about production. Viktor broke Stakhanov's record with an output of 108 tons. A new stage of socialist labor competition began. The enthusiastic call of challenge resounded throughout the Donbass. The sound of the miners' pneumatic picks awakened the labor world of the Soviet people, and the Stakhanovite workers formed a huge offensive front.

However, as Stalin said to Andrei in the book:

"As soon as the Stakhanovite movement emerged, its opposition and its enemies also appeared. This is always the case. The old always blocks the way of the new. To achieve victory, the new must fight the old." (p. 513) The brave Andrei and Viktor did not easily realize their suggestions. The prestigious conservative "old ancestor" sternly rejected their suggestions, and the engineer Grushkov, who was frightened by the incident, also opposed them with "regulations" and "books." More seriously, Rotin (secretary of the Municipal Party Committee), a dissident element who had infiltrated the Party, declared their new record to be "deceptive." Makkichuk, a member of the Petliura bandit gang, even sabotaged the compressed air pipes during the labor process of creating a new record. All the old forces were mobilized to attack the Stakhanovite workers.

However, the young Andrei and Viktor were by no means heroes fighting alone. Behind their creative labor stood the powerful socialist motherland, the strong Bolshevik Party, and countless advanced miner shock workers. Andrei and Viktor's noble qualities grew up under their cultivation and help. Svetly, the leader of the Communist Youth League group, educated Andrei and Viktor with his strict sense of discipline, meticulous work style, and courageous fighting will. Uncle Lesnyak, an old miner who was proud of the mine, tirelessly enriched the labor creativity and wisdom of the younger generation with his experience accumulated with blood and sweat. Zhuravlev, the second secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Nechaenko, the Party Committee secretary of the Maria Mine, both had the tenacious character of fighting Bolsheviks, always stood on the side of the new, guided the new things to move forward continuously, and resolutely supported the struggle of the Stakhanovite workers. Red-haired Mitya, pockmarked Seryocha, young miners who grew up in the same era, Andrei and Viktor's competitive rivals, comrades-in-arms on the production front, as well as Uncle Onishin, the dormitory manager who dedicated his life to the coal mine, all played a significant role in the growth of the young heroes.

In this novel, Gorbatov uses rich artistic descriptions to show the great historical significance of the Stakhanovite movement. The Stakhanovite movement marked the "new and higher stage of socialist competition" in the Soviet Union. The characteristic of this movement, as Stalin said, "started spontaneously, almost spontaneously," "was born from the bottom, expanded from the bottom," and "spread to all parts of my Soviet Union not gradually, but unprecedentedly rapidly, like a whirlwind." But this does not mean that the Stakhanovite movement broke out out of thin air without any foundation. Its emergence itself marked the development of socialist society. "Only a movement that is fully mature and on the verge of breaking out can spread so rapidly and grow like a snowball." "The Stakhanovite movement is a fully mature thing." (All the above quotations from Stalin are from the article "Speech at the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovite Workers") It had its own gestation process. In this gestation process, the socialist system grew, and socialist new people also grew. Gorbatov's "Donbass," through the description of the growth of Andrei and Viktor, vividly shows the true historical content of this movement.

Gorbatov once won the love of a wide range of readers at home and abroad with his masterpiece "The Unbowed." In the first part of his last posthumous work "Donbass," the author's outstanding artistic talent is also demonstrated. The characters in "Donbass" all have rich spiritual worlds and strong life colors. When we read this book, its characters are as active in our minds as reliefs. From these artistic images, we deeply feel the author's pulse, feel the author's sincerity and love. From the lyrical descriptions and unique artistic interludes throughout the book, we can clearly see the characteristics of Gorbatov's works. Gorbatov once radiated the light and heat of his life in the life of miners. He was a contemporary of Andrei and Viktor. Like them, in his youth, he experienced the battle of socialist construction in the motherland and grew up with the development of the motherland. Because of this, he was able to so profoundly shape the diverse images of his contemporaries, and so richly describe the development process of Andrei and Viktor's characters. Precisely because of this, the author's many life-sketch-style lyrical monologues not only did not destroy the harmony of the complete artistic image, but enriched the realistic significance of the work's theme and formed a special style in artistic expression.

The work "Donbass," both in terms of ideological content and artistic form, has a profound educational effect on us.

    社会主义劳动的颂歌
    ——读戈尔巴托夫的长篇小说“顿巴斯”
    李骥
    苏联作家戈尔巴托夫的“顿巴斯”，是一部描写苏联一九三五年斯达哈诺夫运动的长篇小说，它通过对两个青年斯达哈诺夫工作者——安德烈和维克多——的成长过程的描写，生动地反映了这一运动的真实面貌。
    安德烈和维克多是两个普通的七年制中学的毕业生，但他们生活在伟大的社会主义建设的时代——“人们突然感到了自己人类的力量，感到了自己双手的威力和集体努力的效果。一切都有了办法：征服沙漠，填平沼泽，改造社会，改变世界。”（原书一○页）的时代。就在这样的时代，在苏联突飞猛进的一年，安德烈和维克多走出了学校，徘徊在故乡企比略基的普晓河畔，为选择共同的道路沉思着，争吵着。他们已经完全不同于“贫穷替他们决定了一切”的父祖。“他们面前突然开辟了千百条道路。他们可以任意选择一条。”而当他们犹豫不决的时候，社会主义祖国和共青团给他们选定了一条道路——煤矿工的道路。这两个优秀的共青团员，服从了组织的动员，放弃了各种各样的幻想，走上了煤矿工的道路，成了“工业之花”的第一批斯达哈诺夫工作者。
    然而在这条光荣的道路上，他们不是平稳地走过的。他们经历了幻想在现实面前的破灭，经历了精神上的懦怯和动摇。他们对矿工的艰苦劳动产生过害怕，甚至被困难征服过，维克多还做过可耻的“飞行家”（煤矿上“逃兵”的绰号），如果没有安德烈的真挚的帮助，维克多也许就会走上不可饶恕的错误道路。艰苦的实际工作，锻炼了两个青年矿工的意志。他们逐渐变成了熟练的矿工，出色的突击队员。他们知道了矿井的一切秘密，熟悉了每一个黑暗的角落，成为热爱矿井的主人了。他们在工作上的进步和在精神上的成长，使他们不满意自己煤矿的生产量，不满意自己的生产定额，不满意陈旧的工作方法，要求改变它，以便达到更高的生产率，为祖国开采更多的煤。他们在精通本行采煤技术的基础上，热烈地寻求着改进工作的方法，从维克多大胆的梦想，跃进到安德烈的明确的劳动组织分工的建议。安德烈的建议，在平静的马丽雅矿的心脏里，搅起了一场惊心动魄的斗争。建议引起了巨大的反响：“七十吨，七十吨——安德烈大胆地提出的数字，在人人眼前跳动。”（三八○页）事实证明了不满于陈旧的定额和古老的工作方法的，不仅是安德烈和维克多。“人们在狭小的台阶——现在他们觉得台阶比以前更狭了——上转来转去，脑子里只是想着这些数字。”（三八○页）在党和群众的支持下，在中央伊尔明诺矿斯达哈诺夫工作者创造一班采煤一○二吨的新纪录的鼓舞下，马丽雅的矿工们更加鼓起生产热情，维克多以一○八吨的产额打破了斯达哈诺夫的纪录。社会主义劳动竞赛的新阶段开始了。热烈的挑战的声音响遍了顿巴斯，矿工的风镐的响声，震醒了苏联人民的劳动世界，斯达哈诺夫工作者形成了巨大的进攻战线。
    但是，正如书中斯大林同安德烈谈话时所说：
  “斯达哈诺夫运动一产生，它的反对派，它的敌人也就出现了。事情总是这样的。旧事物总是要挡住新事物的路。新事物要取得胜利，就必须跟旧事物进行斗争。”（五一三页）勇敢的安德烈和维克多，不是很轻易地实现了自己的建议的。有威信的保守主义者“老祖宗”严厉地拒绝过他们的建议，被事件搞得胆怯的工程师格鲁施柯夫，也曾用“条例”和“书本”反对过他们。更严重地是混入党内的异己分子罗亭（党市委书记）宣布他们的新纪录是
  “骗人”的，彼得留拉匪帮分子马基楚克更在创造新纪录的劳动过程中破坏压缩空气管。一切旧势力都动员起来向斯达哈诺夫工作者进攻。
    然而，年轻的安德烈和维克多，绝不是什么孤军作战的英雄，在他们创造性的劳动背后，站着强大的社会主义祖国，站着坚强的布尔什维克党，站着无数先进的矿工突击队员。安德烈和维克多的高贵品质正是在他们培养和帮助下成长起来的。青年团组长斯维特里用自己的严格的纪律观念、一丝不苟的工作作风和勇敢的战斗意志，教育了安德烈和维克多。以矿井为骄傲的老矿工列斯尼亚克叔叔，孜孜不倦地用血和汗积累起来的经验丰富了青年一代的劳动创造智慧。党市委第二书记茹拉符列夫和马丽雅矿的党委书记聂察英科，都具有战斗的布尔什维克的顽强性格，始终站在新生的一面，引导新事物不断地前进，坚决地支持了斯达哈诺夫工作者的斗争。红头发的米佳，麻脸的谢辽查，同时代成长起来的年轻矿工，安德烈和维克多的竞赛敌手，生产战线上的战友们，以及把自己一生奉献给煤矿的宿舍管理员奥尼辛叔叔，对年轻的英雄们的成长都有重大的作用。
    在这部小说里，戈尔巴托夫用丰富的艺术描写表明了斯达哈诺夫运动的巨大历史意义。斯达哈诺夫运动标志着苏联“社会主义竞赛底新的更高的阶段”。这一运动的特点，正如斯大林所说，“是自行开始的，几乎是自发开始的”，“是从下层诞生出来，从下层扩展起来的运动”，并且“不是逐渐地，而是空前迅速地，好似狂风一样散布到我苏联全国各地的”。但这绝不是说，斯达哈诺夫运动是没有任何基础凭空爆发的。它的产生本身就标志着社会主义社会的发展。“只有完全成熟而有一触即发之势的运动，才能这样迅速散布起来，好似雪团一般长大起来。”“斯达哈诺夫运动是一件完全成熟了的事情。”（以上所引斯大林的话，均见“在第一次全苏联斯达哈诺夫工作者会议上的演说”一文）它有过自己的孕育过程。在这个孕育过程中，社会主义制度成长着，社会主义的新人也成长着。戈尔巴托夫的“顿巴斯”，通过对安德烈和维克多成长过程的描写，生动地表明了这个运动的真实历史内容。
    戈尔巴托夫曾经以他的杰作“不屈的人们”博得苏联国内外广大读者的热爱。在他的最后的遗作“顿巴斯”第一部里，同样表现出作者的杰出的艺术才能。“顿巴斯”里的人物，都有着丰富的精神世界和强有力的生命色彩。我们读了这本书，它的人物都像浮雕一样活跃在我们的心目里。我们从这些艺术形象中，深切地感觉到作者的脉搏，感受到作者的真情和热爱，从全书的抒情描写和独特的艺术插曲里，我们可以清楚地看到戈尔巴托夫的作品的特点。戈尔巴托夫曾经在矿工生活中放射过自己的生命的光和热，他正是安得烈和维克多的同时代人。他像他们一样，在青春的年代里，体验过祖国社会主义建设的战斗，伴随着祖国的发展而成长起来。正因为这样，他才能那样深刻地塑造出同时代人多种多样的形象，那样丰富地描写了安得烈和维克多的性格的发展过程。也正因为这样，作者的许多生活散记式的抒情独白，不仅没有破坏完整的艺术形象的和谐，反而丰富了作品主题的现实意义，形成了艺术表现上的特殊格调。
      “顿巴斯”这部作品，无论在思想内容或艺术形式上，对于我们都有着深刻的教育作用。
