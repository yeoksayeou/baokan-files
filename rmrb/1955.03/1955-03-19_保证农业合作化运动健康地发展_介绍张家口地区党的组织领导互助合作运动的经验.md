Ensuring the Healthy Development of the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
    ——Introducing the Experience of the Party Organization Leading the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in the Zhangjiakou Area
    Li Wanjun
    Since the publicity of the General Line and the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain in the winter of 1953, a new situation has emerged in the agricultural cooperation movement in the Zhangjiakou Special District. Agricultural producer cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives have developed rapidly, beginning to incorporate the scattered rural economy into the national economic track. Over the past year and a half, the Party organizations in the Zhangjiakou area have explored the following experiences in leading the agricultural cooperation movement:

    In the winter of 1953, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee shifted the focus of Party leadership to mutual aid and cooperation. All major issues concerning policies and principles in establishing cooperatives were collectively discussed and resolved by the Party Committee. Former Prefectural Committee Secretary Zhao Zhenzhong and the current Prefectural Committee Secretary Liu Yiming personally inspected the work of agricultural producer cooperatives in Songjiazhuang Township, Xuanhua County, and Shajiazhuang Township, Wanquan County, as well as other places, helping agricultural producer cooperatives solve specific production problems. To assist the Party Committee in grasping the situation of mutual aid and cooperation, the Prefectural and County Committees established Mutual Aid and Cooperation Offices before the Central Committee approved the establishment of the Rural Work Department; after the Central Committee approved the establishment of the Rural Work Department, cadres were immediately assigned to establish the Rural Work Department. County and District Committees also established key cooperatives, and the Prefectural Committee grasped key districts, townships, and five large cooperatives with more than one hundred households, exploring the experience of establishing cooperatives.

    On the other hand, both County and District Committees paid attention to fully leveraging the leading role of Township Branches in the agricultural cooperation movement. In 1954, the vast majority of Township Branches in the entire Special District learned how to establish cooperatives. Many branches formulated plans for leading and developing mutual aid and cooperation work in their respective townships based on the specific conditions of each township. The plans were fully discussed within the entire branch, and after the plans were made, branch committee members and Party members were assigned to different villages and areas to be responsible for their implementation. After the Xi Hongsi Township Branch of Zhuolu County made a plan to promote agricultural production centered on mutual aid and cooperation in the spring of 1954, the eleven branch committee members divided their work according to the plan. Branch Secretary Wen Dianchun led the Dongjiafangzi Agricultural Producer Cooperative, and the other ten branch committee members were responsible for leading the key mutual aid groups in their respective villages. Party members participating in agricultural producer cooperatives and mutual aid groups were responsible for running their own cooperatives and groups well. In this way, not only were the existing cooperatives and groups well-managed, but also five new cooperatives were developed after the autumn harvest, with the number of farmers joining cooperatives reaching 54% of the total number of farmers in the township.

    In order to teach all cadres how to establish cooperatives, the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee, County Committees, and District Committees adopted various methods to train and cultivate a large number of cooperative establishment cadres and key personnel. In the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of 1954, 23,153 County, District, and Township cadres, as well as agricultural producer cooperative directors, mutual aid group leaders, and activists were trained and cultivated in the form of mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings. During the winter cooperative establishment period, the County Committee Secretaries and County Committee members of the Special District personally lectured, training 620 County and District cadres, 1,082 Township cadres, and 23,125 new and old cooperative directors and accountants in batches. In addition, Party Committees at all levels assigned cadres who knew how to establish cooperatives to key villages, and trained more rural cadres, mutual aid group leaders, and activists in practice through the mutual aid and cooperation network, using the method of experienced people leading inexperienced people, old cooperatives leading new cooperatives, and masters leading apprentices. Now, the phenomenon of cadres going to the countryside not knowing how to establish cooperatives and avoiding cooperatives has basically disappeared.

    During the period of great development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the Zhangjiakou Special District, Party Committees at all levels generally changed the past method of establishing cooperatives through campaigns, and implemented the policy of establishing cooperatives with constant preparation. The Zhangjiakou Special District implemented the policy of constant preparation for establishing cooperatives from the following two aspects:

    First, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction that "the serious problem is to educate the peasants," ideological education for cooperative members and peasants was strengthened. Party Committees at all levels used methods of recollection, comparison, and accounting to improve the socialist consciousness of cooperative members and the masses of peasants. Later, in conjunction with the publicity of the General Line, ideological discussions of the two different figures, Tian Jingtian and Qiao Duokui, were conducted, as well as constitution publicity and education. Of course, it is not enough to only conduct general publicity and education to the peasants, but also to use concrete facts to improve the socialist consciousness of the peasants. In the autumn of 1954, agricultural producer cooperatives increased production, with the average yield per mu being about 11% higher than the average yield per mu of mutual aid groups and individual peasants. All localities used this fact of increased production to carry out publicity and education to the peasants, enabling the peasants and cooperative members to further recognize the superiority of agricultural producer cooperatives.

    Mutual aid groups are the foundation for establishing agricultural producer cooperatives. Party Committees at all levels in the Zhangjiakou Special District paid attention to strengthening the leadership of mutual aid groups while establishing cooperatives. The Zhangjiakou area universally promoted the experience of one cooperative leading two or three groups. The 1,467 agricultural producer cooperatives in the entire Special District led more than 5,000 mutual aid groups. Close political and economic ties were established between the cooperatives and groups. Agricultural producer cooperatives generally absorbed mutual aid group leaders to participate when formulating plans and convening management committees, and agricultural producer cooperatives sent people to help mutual aid groups arrange farm work and solve difficulties in production. After the autumn harvest last year, 220,000 mutual aid group members and individual peasants in the entire Special District signed up to join cooperatives. Among the 4,390 new cooperatives established from September last year to February this year, more than 2,500 were transformed from key mutual aid groups cultivated by Township and Village Party Branches.

    In the situation where thousands of mutual aid groups and individual peasants demanded to participate in agricultural producer cooperatives, some places only saw the enthusiastic side of the peasants' emotions, and ignored the complex side of the peasants' thinking, thus resulting in the deviation of commandism. Yaojiafangzi Township in Xuanhua County held meetings day and night to make the masses sign up to join cooperatives in order to realize cooperation in the entire township. After the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee discovered this commandist deviation, it immediately took measures to correct it, pointing out that only agricultural producer cooperatives established on a voluntary basis have vitality and can be consolidated; commandism can only make peasants reject and leave agricultural producer cooperatives, and destroy the cooperation movement. In this way, the hasty emotions and commandist phenomena in the movement were gradually overcome, ensuring the healthy development of the movement.

    In order to effectively prevent the occurrence of blind and rash advances, the Party Committee also strictly controlled the development plans of agricultural cooperatives. After the situation of great development of agricultural producer cooperatives in the autumn of 1954, the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee formulated development plans for each region according to the different conditions of each region. Controlling the plan meant controlling the number of cooperative developments on the one hand, and controlling the establishment of large cooperatives and agricultural producer cooperatives that do not distribute land dividends at present on the other.

    In the process of establishing cooperatives, the Zhangjiakou Special District adhered to the Party's fundamental line of relying on poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), consolidating the unity of middle peasants, developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy, and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture. In the process of establishing cooperatives in various places, the political advantage of poor peasants was first established, and then the policy of equal value and mutual benefit was earnestly implemented within the cooperatives to unite the middle peasants, so that the middle and poor peasants united to run the agricultural producer cooperatives well, and the rich peasants who had mixed into the agricultural producer cooperatives were purged. Now, the unity between the rural poor peasants and middle peasants has been strengthened, more people have joined agricultural producer cooperatives, and the rich peasants have been isolated.

    At present, there are 5,857 agricultural producer cooperatives in the entire Zhangjiakou Special District, with 206,561 farmer households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 34.5% of the total number of farmer households. In the 1,249 townships of the 125 districts of the 16 counties in the entire Special District, one county, ten districts, and 209 townships have basically cooperated (the number of farmer households joining cooperatives accounts for more than 60% of the total number of farmer households). Every township in the entire Special District has agricultural producer cooperatives. With the development of agricultural producer cooperatives, credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives have also developed greatly; there are now 1,238 credit cooperatives and 3 credit departments (located in supply and marketing cooperatives) in the entire Special District, basically achieving that every township has a credit cooperative organization; there are now 138 supply and marketing cooperatives and 946 stores and 28 mobile stalls in the entire Special District, also basically achieving that every township has a supply and marketing cooperative organization. In early February, Zhangjiakou organized more than 3,900 cadres to go to the countryside to help Township Branches, starting with carrying out spring plowing production, to carry out the rectification and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

    保证农业合作化运动健康地发展
    ——介绍张家口地区党的组织领导互助合作运动的经验
    李万军
    自一九五三年冬天宣传总路线和实行粮食统购统销以来，张家口专区的农业合作化运动出现了一种新形势。农业生产合作社、信用合作社和供销合作社的发展很快，开始把分散的农村经济纳入国家经济轨道。一年半以来，张家口地区党的组织，在领导农业合作化运动中，摸索出以下几点经验：
    一九五三年冬天，根据党中央指示，张家口地委把党的领导中心转到互助合作方面来，凡是建社中的有关政策原则性的重大问题，都经过了党委会的集体讨论集体做出决议。前地委书记赵振中和现任的地委书记刘一鸣，都曾亲自到宣化县宋家庄乡和万全县沙家庄乡及其它一些地方检查农业生产合作社的工作，帮助农业生产合作社解决生产上的具体问题。为了协助党委掌握互助合作情况，中央未批准成立农村工作部以前，地委和县委都成立了互助合作办公室；中央批准成立农村工作部以后，立即配备干部成立了农村工作部。各县、区委还都建立了基点社，地委掌握了基点区、乡及五个百户以上的大社，摸索建社的经验。
    另一方面，不论县委、区委，都注意在工作中充分发挥乡支部对农业合作化运动的领导作用，一九五四年全专区绝大部分的乡支部，都学会了办社方法。许多支部根据各个乡的具体情况做出了领导和发展本乡互助合作工作的计划，做计划时在全支部进行充分的讨论，计划做出后，支委和党员按村分片包干负责贯彻实现。涿鹿县下洪寺乡支部，一九五四年春天，做了以互助合作为中心推动农业生产的计划以后，十一个支部委员按照计划分工领导，支部书记温殿春领导董家房子农业生产合作社，其他十个支委分工负责领导所在村的重点互助组。参加农业生产合作社和互助组的党员，都负责把自己的社和组办好。这样，不但把现有的社、组办好了，而且秋后又发展了五个新社，全乡入社农户达到总农户的百分之五十四。
    为了教会全体干部办社，张家口地委、县委和区委都曾采用了各种办法，训练和培养了大批办社干部和建社的骨干。一九五四年内春、夏、秋三季，以互助合作代表会议的形式训练和培养了县、区、乡干部和农业生产合作社社长、互助组长及积极分子二万三千一百五十三名。冬季建社时，专区的各县委书记和县委委员亲自讲课，分批训练了县、区干部六百二十人，乡干部一千零八十二人，新、旧社长和会计二万三千一百二十五人。此外，各级党委又把会办社的干部分配到基点村去，通过互助合作网，用熟手带生手、老社带新社和师父带徒弟的方法，从实际工作中训练了更多的农村干部和互助组长及积极分子。现在，干部下乡不会办社，躲着合作社走的现象基本上没有了。
    张家口专区农业合作化运动大发展期中，各级党委普遍地改变了过去突击办社的方法，贯彻了常年有准备的办社方针。张家口专区贯彻常年准备办社的方针是从以下两方面来进行的：
    首先是根据毛泽东同志的“严重的问题是教育农民”的指示，加强了对社员和农民的思想教育。各级党委都用回忆、对比和算账的方法，提高了社员和农民群众的社会主义觉悟。以后又结合总路线的宣传，进行了田景秀和乔多奎两种不同人物的思想讨论，以及宪法宣传教育。当然只向农民进行一般的宣传教育是不够的，还必须用具体事实来提高农民的社会主义觉悟。一九五四年秋天，农业生产合作社增产了，每亩地的平均产量比互助组和个体农民的每亩地平均产量高百分之十一左右。各地都用这一增产的事实向农民进行宣传教育，使农民和社员进一步认识到农业生产合作社的优越性。
    互助组是办农业生产合作社的基础。张家口专区各级党委在建社的同时都注意加强对互助组的领导。张家口地区普遍推行了一社带动两三个组的经验。全专区一千四百六十七个农业生产合作社，曾带动了五千多个互助组。社、组之间，在政治上和经济上都建立了密切的联系，农业生产合作社订计划和召开管理委员会时一般地都吸收互助组长参加，农业生产合作社并派人帮助互助组安排农活，帮助互助组解决生产中的困难。去年秋后全专区有二十二万个互助组员和个体农民报名入社。去年九月到今年二月办的四千三百九十个新社中，就有二千五百多个是乡、村党支部培养的重点互助组转成的。
    在成千上万互助组和个体农民要求参加农业生产合作社的情况下，有些地方只看到农民情绪热烈的一面，忽视了农民思想复杂的一面，因而发生了强迫命令的偏向。宣化县姚家房子乡为了使全乡合作化，白天黑夜连着开会让群众报名入社。张家口地委发现了这种强迫命令偏向以后，立即采取措施进行了纠正，指出：只有在自愿的基础上建立起来的农业生产合作社才具有生命力，才能巩固；强迫命令，只能使农民拒绝和离开农业生产合作社，破坏合作化运动。这样就逐步地克服了运动中的急躁情绪和强迫命令现象，保证了运动的健康发展。
    为了有效地防止盲目冒进偏向的发生，党委还严格地控制了农业社的发展计划。一九五四年秋天，农业生产合作社大发展的情况到来后，张家口地委即根据各个地区的不同条件，规定了各地区的发展计划。控制计划，一方面是控制社的发展数量；另一方面是控制少办大社和目前不办土地不分红的农业生产合作社。
    张家口专区在办社过程中坚持了党的依靠贫农（包括全部原为贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，发展互助合作运动，限制和逐步消灭富农经济，对农业实行社会主义改造的根本路线。各地在建社中，首先是树立了贫农的政治优势，然后在合作社内认真贯彻等价互利政策来团结中农，使中、贫农联合起来，办好农业生产合作社，并清除了混入农业生产合作社的富农。现在，农村贫农和中农的团结增强了，参加农业生产合作社的多了，富农孤立了。
    现在，张家口全专区共有农业生产合作社五千八百五十七个，入社农户二十万六千五百六十一户，占总农户的百分之三十四点五。在全专区十六个县一百二十五个区一千二百四十九个乡内，已有一个县、十个区、二百零九个乡基本上合作化了（入社农户达总农户的百分之六十以上）。全专区每个乡里都有了农业生产合作社。随着农业生产合作社的发展，信用合作社和供销合作社也有了很大的发展；全专区现有一千二百三十八个信用合作社和三个信用部（设在供销合作社内），基本上达到乡乡都有信用合作的组织；全专区现有一百三十八个供销合作社和九百四十六个门市部及二十八个流动货摊，也基本上达到乡乡都有供销合作的组织。二月初张家口组织了三千九百多名干部下乡帮助乡支部，从开展春耕生产入手，进行农业社的整顿和巩固工作。
