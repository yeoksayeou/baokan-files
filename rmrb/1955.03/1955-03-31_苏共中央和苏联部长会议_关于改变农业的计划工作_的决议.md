    Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers
    "On Changing Agricultural Planning Work"
    March 9, 1955
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union pointed out that there are serious shortcomings and errors in the agricultural planning work of the Soviet State Planning Committee, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Procurement. The existing agricultural planning system is not in line with national needs because it is over-centralized and stipulates a large number of indicators for collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. In order to ensure that the state has various agricultural products, it is completely unnecessary for the central government to notify collective farms and state farms of the sowing plans for various crops and to formulate plans for the types and numbers of livestock. This prevents collective farms and state farms from playing an active role in managing agriculture more correctly and reasonably.
    According to the current planning system, the sowing plan must be notified to the collective farm, and the sowing plan strictly stipulates the crops to be sown and the sown area, as well as the types and numbers of livestock that the collective farm must raise. This planning system has in many cases caused unreasonable agricultural management. The rigid formulation of sowing area plans has led to incorrect crop distribution, which is not only unsuitable for the economic, soil, and climatic conditions of the collective farms, does not conform to the experience accumulated by the collective farms in agricultural management and the existing level of cultivation, but also does not help to expand the total harvest of crops. This planning work also prevents collective farms from organizing the breeding of public livestock more correctly in order to expand the production of meat, milk, eggs, wool and other products. All these have restricted the initiative of collective farms and machine tractor stations, weakened their sense of responsibility and care for the development of agricultural production, and not only failed to stimulate collective farms to expand agricultural land to increase production, but also reduced the possibility of collective farms obtaining high incomes.
    Due to incorrect planning work, and as a result of the Soviet State Planning Committee and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture's attempt to order everything from above, the southern regions of our country, especially Ukraine, were forced to sow spring wheat, although local staff, based on years of work experience, proved that sowing winter wheat was appropriate. At the same time, despite the opposition of local staff, winter crops have been prescribed for many years in some areas of Siberia, the Urals and Kazakhstan, although according to the conditions in this area, the harvest of winter grain crops has always been much lower than that of spring grain crops.
    Corn is a source of drastically expanding grain production and establishing a solid feed base for animal husbandry. Despite its high value, until recently, it was only planned to sow this high-yielding crop in the southern states and republics, and it was not prescribed to sow this crop in other parts of the country, although there is already ample scientific material and advanced experience to prove that corn can be grown in almost all regions of our country.
    As is well known, farmers in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have been widely engaged in the fattening of fine meat pigs for decades, and have accumulated a lot of experience in this area and established a suitable feed base. However, the staff of the planning and agricultural authorities insisted on forcing the collective farms and state farms along the Baltic coast to engage in the fattening of lard pigs and semi-lard pigs.
    It is more beneficial to the country, to collective farms, and to collective farm members to develop dairy animal husbandry and pig raising in the suburbs of cities where there are not enough pastures. This seems to be clear to everyone. However, every year, for no reason, it is stipulated that the collective farms and state farms in these areas must increase the number of sheep. At the same time, in the plan for the development of animal husbandry, no good consideration has been given to the favorable conditions for the development of fine wool and semi-fine wool sheep breeding in the collective farms and state farms of Kazakhstan, Siberia, and Central Asia, which have large areas of pasture land.
    The Soviet State Planning Committee and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture have formulated unnecessarily overly detailed plans for the development of agriculture, but they have not studied important issues such as meeting the needs of individual regions of the country for various agricultural products, nor have they guided local staff to expand the production of such products. In the Far Eastern regions, there are all the conditions for achieving a bumper harvest of potatoes and vegetable crops and for developing animal husbandry. Nevertheless, the plan stipulates that potatoes, vegetables, and livestock products must be transported from other parts of the country to supply the cities and industrial enterprises in the Far East.
    It is completely incorrect to stipulate a large number of work projects for tractors by the central government for machine tractor stations in the national economic plan. This restricts the heads and experts of machine tractor stations and the management committees of collective farms, preventing them from playing an active role in determining the truly necessary tractor work projects in local conditions in order to obtain a bumper harvest of agricultural products.
    All these once again prove that the current agricultural planning system is unnecessary. It does not conform to the interests of the country, nor does it conform to the interests of collective farms and collective farm members.
    When such bureaucratic, exaggerated, and detached-from-reality planning exists, it is impossible to consider the main issue—collective farms and state farms must plan the output of commodity products based on the quantity that can guarantee the country's needs for agricultural products.
    The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers believe that a new planning system must be implemented in collective farms, and the starting point of this planning system should be the output of commodity products. The planning of agricultural production should be directly formulated by collective farms (in conjunction with machine tractor stations) and state farms, and consideration should be given to how to better utilize agricultural land. At the same time, in formulating plans and calculations, it should not be based on the number of hectares sown with a certain crop and the number of livestock in the herd, but on the number of centners of grain, potatoes, vegetables, and other agricultural products harvested, and on the output of meat, milk, wool, and other animal products.
    The agricultural products that collective farms hand over to the state according to the system of compulsory sales, payment in kind, and sales are only a part of their production, and a large part of the products are left at the disposal of the collective farms. Considering this situation, the new planning system will provide collective farms with huge possibilities to give play to the enthusiasm of management in utilizing the production potential of collective farms.
    The new planning system will help to improve the initiative of collective farm members, machine tractor stations and state farm staff in the cause of further developing agriculture, so that every collective farm and state farm can obtain a large amount of products from the agricultural land they use, and strengthen the responsibility of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms for producing the necessary amount of agricultural products for the country, that is, for the entire Soviet people.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR decided:
    1. In the national agricultural development plan approved by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the total procurement of agricultural and animal husbandry products in terms of compulsory sales, payment in kind for the work of machine tractor stations, ordering system and sales should be stipulated, and this quantity should be able to guarantee the needs of residents for food and the needs of industry for agricultural raw materials; at the same time, the total amount of tractor work carried out by machine tractor stations in collective farms should be stipulated.
    2. The Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics with states should, in accordance with the national plan, notify the frontier regions, states, and autonomous republics of the planned tasks formulated according to the established indicators.
    The Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics without states, as well as the Councils of Ministers of the Autonomous Republics, the executive committees of the frontier regions, and the executive committees of the states should notify the districts of the agricultural development plans formulated according to these indicators, and notify the machine tractor stations of the amount of tractor work.
    3. The district executive committees should, in accordance with the national agricultural development plan, notify each collective farm of the planned tasks for the total procurement of agricultural and animal husbandry products in terms of compulsory sales, payment in kind for the work of machine tractor stations, ordering system and sales in the second year before September 1 of the current year.
    4. Each collective farm, with the participation of the machine tractor station, shall, according to the task of delivering agricultural and animal husbandry products to the state and ensuring the needs of the collective farm and collective farm members for such products, decide on its own the scope of the sowing area of various crops and the productivity of animal husbandry and the number of various types of livestock.
    Considering that the products handed over by the collective farms to the state are only a part of what they produce, the starting point for drawing up the plan for developing the public economy of the collective farms should be that it is necessary to maximize and intensively utilize all agricultural land, which is the main source of wealth for the collective farms, and increase the output of products per hundred hectares of agricultural land under specific soil, climate, and economic conditions.
    5. It is recommended that the management committee of the collective farm submit the crop sowing plan and the animal husbandry development plan jointly formulated with the machine tractor station to the general meeting of collective farm members for discussion and approval.
    The crop sowing plan and the animal husbandry development plan adopted by the general meeting of collective farm members should be submitted to the district executive committee for review. When the plan submitted by the collective farm cannot enable the collective farm to guarantee the completion of the task of sales and payment in kind for the work of machine tractor stations, and the contract tasks of the ordering system and state procurement with appropriate crops and animal husbandry products, the district executive committee may suggest that the collective farm make necessary revisions to the plan.
    6. In order to establish supervision over the development of various sectors of agriculture, ensure the completion of the production plan and procurement plan of agricultural products, and the correct distribution of machinery and equipment, power, investment and other material resources allocated by the state to agriculture, the Soviet State Planning Committee is charged with comprehensively studying and analyzing the agricultural development plans submitted by local authorities.
    Each district executive committee shall, before October 1 of the current year, submit the comprehensive plan for agricultural development in the second year of the collective farms in the district to the state executive committee, the frontier region executive committee, the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic, and the Council of Ministers of the Union Republics without states according to the form approved by the Council of Ministers of the USSR;
    The state executive committee, the frontier region executive committee, and the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic shall submit the agricultural development plan of the state, the frontier region, and the Autonomous Republic to the Council of Ministers of the Union Republics before October 20;
    Each Council of Ministers of the Union Republics shall submit the comprehensive plan for agricultural development of the Union Republic to the Soviet State Planning Committee and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture before November 10.
    7. The state plan shall only determine the total amount of tractor work for the machine tractor station (converted into arable land work). Within the total amount of tractor work, the head of the machine tractor station may determine the amount of various types of tractor work according to the contract signed with the collective farm.
    The head of the machine tractor station has the right, when necessary, to change the amount of certain types of tractor work within a year with the consent of the collective farm.
    The head of the machine tractor station is charged with paying attention to the widespread implementation of comprehensive mechanization of agricultural work, fully utilizing all existing machinery and tractors, timely adopting a complete set of agronomic technical measures suitable for local conditions, increasing the yield per unit area of crops, expanding the production of feed needed for animal husbandry, and eliminating losses in harvesting when formulating the plan for various types of tractor work.
    8. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms and their local authorities are charged with making their work and the work of scientific research institutes and experimental institutes fully help collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms to correctly formulate plans for developing agriculture and adopting advanced experience and scientific achievements, so as to obtain the largest output per hundred hectares of agricultural land with the least amount of labor and capital spent on each unit of product.
    9. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture is charged with determining the tasks of each Union Republic according to the cost of each centner of agricultural products (major types) obtained by the state through machine tractor stations in terms of payment in kind, and notifying each machine tractor station of this task through local agricultural authorities.
    In order to obtain preliminary figures for the expected harvest, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms are charged with evaluating the harvest of various crops, and entrusting the chief agronomist of machine tractor stations and state farms to be responsible for this work.
    10. The Soviet State Planning Committee is charged with focusing on the following points in the preparation of agricultural plans: formulating long-term plans, correctly allocating agricultural production according to the domestic economic regions and natural geographical regions, so that agriculture can develop in a balanced manner with other sectors of the national economy, and paying attention to supervising the completion of the agricultural development plan and ensuring the supply of the country with various necessary agricultural products.
    11. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms are charged with re-examining and determining the production plan form of collective farms and the production and financial plan form of machine tractor stations and state farms before July 1, 1955, according to the changes made in agricultural planning work in this resolution.
    12. The Soviet State Planning Committee, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the Soviet Ministry of Procurement, and the Soviet Central Bureau of Statistics, together with the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics, shall draft proposals on changing to formulating the production plan of the most important agricultural and animal husbandry products according to each hundred hectares of agricultural land, as well as formulating a plan for the main indicators of agricultural development for collective farms and state farms for a longer period of time, and submit them to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR before October 15, 1955.
                  ×　　×　　×
    The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers believe that the new planning system can enable collective farms and state farms to improve the use of their land and greatly increase the output of agricultural products and animal husbandry products. The creative initiative of collective farm members and the staff of machine tractor stations and state farms in agricultural planning will help to solve the national task of rapidly improving agriculture in a shorter period of time, so that the country has sufficient grain, meat, milk, potatoes, vegetables and other agricultural products, and can fully meet the needs of industry for raw materials.

### 苏共中央和苏联部长会议  “关于改变农业的计划工作”的决议

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议
    “关于改变农业的计划工作”的决议
    一九五五年三月九日
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议指出，苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、采购部在农业计划工作中存在着严重的缺点和错误。现有的农业计划制度因为过分集中并替集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场规定了大量的指标，所以是不切合国家需要的。为了保证使国家拥有各种农产品，完全不必要由中央把各种作物的播种计划通知各集体农庄和国营农场，并制定牲畜的种类和头数的计划。这反而使集体农庄和国营农场不能在更正确、更合理地经营农业方面发挥主动性。
    根据现行的计划制度，要把播种计划通知集体农庄，播种计划严格地规定了播种的作物和播种面积，以及集体农庄所必须饲养的牲畜种类和头数。这种计划制度在很多情况下造成了农业经营不合理的现象。死板地制定播种面积的计划工作，造成了农作物分布不正确的情况，这种分布情况不但不适合各集体农庄的经济、土壤和气候条件，不符合集体农庄在经营农业方面积累起来的经验和现有的耕作水平，而且也不能有助于扩大农作物的总收获量。这种计划工作还使集体农庄不能更正确地组织公有牲畜的饲养工作，以扩大肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋、羊毛和其它产品的生产。所有这些都束缚了集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的主动性，削弱了他们对发展农业生产的责任心和关怀，不但不能刺激集体农庄的农业用地扩大产量，反而减少了集体农庄获得高额收入的可能。
    由于不正确的计划工作，由于苏联国家计划委员会和苏联农业部企图由上边来命令一切的结果，强使我国南部各区，特别是乌克兰，播种了春小麦，虽然，当地工作人员根据多年的工作经验，证明播种冬小麦是适宜的。同时，不顾当地工作人员的反对，在西伯利亚、乌拉尔和哈萨克斯坦的一些地区，多年来一直规定播种冬季作物，虽然根据这个地区的条件，冬季谷类作物的收获量一向是大大低于春季谷类作物的。
    玉蜀黍是急剧扩大谷物生产和建立畜牧业稳固饲料基地的源泉。尽管它具有极高的价值，但是，直到最近，只是计划在南方各州和各共和国播种这种高产量作物，而没有规定在国内其它各地播种这种作物，虽则已经有充分的科学材料和先进经验证明，在我国各地区几乎都可以种植玉蜀黍。
    如所周知，立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚等地的农民，几十年来都广泛地从事精肉用猪的肥育工作，在这方面积累了很多经验而且建立了适当的饲料基地。然而计划机关和农业机关的工作人员却硬要强迫波罗的海沿岸各集体农庄和国营农场去从事油脂用猪和半油脂用猪的肥育工作。
    在没有足够的牧场的城市近郊，发展乳用养畜业和养猪业，对国家、对集体农庄和集体农庄庄员，都是更有好处的。看起来，这一点好像是大家都清楚的。但是，每年都毫无理由地规定这些地区的集体农庄和国营农场必须增加羊的头数。同时在发展畜牧业的计划中，却没有很好地考虑到，在拥有大量牧场用地的哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚和中亚细亚的各集体农庄和国营农场，具有发展细毛和半细毛绵羊饲养业的有利条件。
    苏联国家计划委员会和苏联农业部制定了不必要的过于琐碎的发展农业的计划，然而却没有研究像满足国内个别地区对各种农产品的需要这类重要问题，也没有指导地方工作人员来扩大这类产品的生产。在远东各区，有使马铃薯和蔬菜作物获得丰收以及发展畜牧业的一切条件。尽管如此，计划却规定要从国内其它地区运马铃薯、蔬菜和畜产品去供应远东的城市和工业企业。
    在国民经济计划中，由中央替机器拖拉机站规定好拖拉机的大量工作项目，这是完全不正确的。这就束缚了机器拖拉机站站长和专家以及集体农庄管理委员会，使他们在当地条件下为得到农产品丰收而决定真正必要的拖拉机工作项目方面，不能发挥主动精神。
    所有这些都再一次证明，现行的农业计划制度是不必要的。它既不符合国家的利益，也不符合集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的利益。
    当这种官僚主义的、过分夸大的、脱离生活实际的计划存在的时候，就不能考虑到主要的问题——必须根据能保证全国对农产品需要的数量，来计划集体农庄和国营农场商品产品的产量。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为必须在集体农庄中实行新的计划工作制度，这种计划制度的出发点应当是商品产品的产量。农业生产的计划应当直接由集体农庄（会同机器拖拉机站）和国营农场开始制定，并且应考虑如何更好地利用农业用地。同时，在制定计划和计算时，不应以某种作物所播种的公顷数和畜群的牲畜头数为依据，而应当以收获的谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜和其它农产品的公担数目，以肉、牛奶、羊毛及其它畜产品的产量为依据。
    集体农庄按照义务交售、实物支付和出售的制度交给国家的农产品，只是他们生产的一部分，而很大一部分产品是留给集体农庄支配的。考虑到这种情况，新的计划制度将为集体农庄提供巨大的可能性，以使它们在利用集体农庄的生产潜力方面发挥经营的积极性。
    新的计划制度将有助于提高集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员在进一步发展农业的事业中的主动性，使每一个集体农庄和国营农场从它们所使用的农业用地上得到大量产品，加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场对于为国家，也就是为苏联全体人民生产必需数量的农产品的责任。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定：
    一、在苏联部长会议批准的国家发展农业计划中，应在义务交售、对机器拖拉机站工作的实物支付、订购制和出售等方面规定对农业和畜牧业产品的征购总量，此数量应能保证居民对粮食的需要和工业对农业原料的需要；同时应规定机器拖拉机站在集体农庄进行的拖拉机工作的总量。
    二、设有州的加盟共和国部长会议，按照国家计划，应将根据既定指标制定的计划任务通知边疆区、州、和自治共和国。
    不设州的加盟共和国部长会议，以及自治共和国部长会议、边疆区执行委员会和州执行委员会应将按这些指标制定的发展农业计划通知各区，并将拖拉机的工作量通知机器拖拉机站。
    三、区执行委员会根据国家发展农业的计划，应在当年九月一日以前，把第二年在义务交售、对机器拖拉机站工作的实物支付、订购制和出售等方面对农业和畜牧业产品的征购总量的计划任务，通知各集体农庄。
    四、各集体农庄在机器拖拉机站的参加下，根据向国家交售农业和畜牧业产品的任务和保证集体农庄和集体农庄庄员对这种产品的需要，得自行决定各种农作物播种面积的范围以及畜牧业的产品生产率和各类牲畜的数量。
    由于考虑到集体农庄交给国家的只是它们所生产的一部分产品，因此，在草拟发展集体农庄公有经济的计划时，其出发点应是：必须最高限度地和精耕细作地利用作为集体农庄主要富源的全部农业用地，并在具体的土壤、气候和经济条件下，增加每一百公顷农业用地产品的产量。
    五、建议集体农庄管理委员会把和机器拖拉机站共同制定的作物播种计划和发展畜牧业计划，交由集体农庄庄员全体大会加以讨论和批准。
    集体农庄庄员全体大会通过的作物播种计划和发展畜牧业计划应交区执行委员会审查。当集体农庄所提交的计划，不能使集体农庄以适当的作物和畜牧业产品保证完成交售和对机器拖拉机站工作的实物支付，完成订购制和国家收购的合同任务时，区执行委员会得建议集体农庄对计划作必要的修正。
    六、为了确立对农业各部门的发展的监督，保证农产品的生产计划和征购计划的完成，以及国家拨给农业的机器设备、动力、投资和其他物质资源的正确分配，责成苏联国家计划委员会对地方机关提交的发展农业计划加以综合和分析。
    各区执行委员会应于当年十月一日以前，根据苏联部长会议批准的形式，把本区各集体农庄第二年发展农业的综合计划送交州执行委员会、边疆区执行委员会、自治共和国部长会议和不设州的加盟共和国部长会议；
    州执行委员会、边疆区执行委员会和自治共和国部长会议应于十月二十日以前将州、边疆区和自治共和国发展农业的计划送交加盟共和国部长会议；
    各加盟共和国部长会议应于十一月十日前将加盟共和国发展农业的综合计划送交苏联国家计划委员会和苏联农业部。
    七、国家计划中仅为机器拖拉机站确定拖拉机的工作总量（折合成耕地工作计算）。机器拖拉机站站长根据同集体农庄签订的合同，在拖拉机工作总量范围内，可以决定拖拉机的各种工作的数量。
    机器拖拉机站站长有权在必要时，根据需要并取得集体农庄的同意，得在一年的期间内改变拖拉机的某几种工作的工作量。
    责成机器拖拉机站站长在制定拖拉机各种工作的计划时，应注意广泛施行农业工作的全面机械化、充分利用现有的全部机器和拖拉机、及时采用适合当地条件的整套农艺技术措施、提高农作物的单位面积产量、扩大畜牧业所需饲料的生产、消除在收获中的损耗。
    八、责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部及其地方机关，使自己的工作以及科学研究机关和实验机关的工作全力帮助集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场来正确制定发展农业、采用先进经验和科学成就的计划，以便在每一单位产品耗费最少劳动和资金的情况下，在每一百公顷农业用地上获得最大的产量。
    九、责成苏联农业部根据国家通过机器拖拉机站在实物支付方面所得到的每一公担农产品（主要几种）的花费，来确定各加盟共和国的任务，并经由地方农业机关将此项任务通知各机器拖拉机站。
    为了得到预期的收获量的初步数字，责成苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部对各种作物的收获量进行评估，并将此项工作委托机器拖拉机站和国营农场的总农艺师来负责。
    十、责成苏联国家计划委员会在编制农业计划方面，要集中注意下列几点：制定远景计划，按照国内的经济区域和自然地理区域来正确配置农业生产，使农业能和国民经济其他部门均衡发展，并注意对完成发展农业计划和保证以各种必要的农产品供应国家方面进行监督。
    十一、责成苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部于一九五五年七月一日前，根据本决议对农业计划工作所做的各项改变，重新审查并确定集体农庄的生产计划形式和机器拖拉机站及国营农场的生产财务计划形式。
    十二、责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、苏联采购部和苏联中央统计局会同加盟共和国部长会议就改行根据每一百公顷农业用地来制定最主要的农业和畜牧业产品的生产计划，以及为集体农庄和国营农场制定较长时期的发展农业的主要指标的计划方面，草拟出建议，并于一九五五年十月十五日以前送交苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议。
                  ×　　×　　×
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，新的计划制度可以使各集体农庄和国营农场改善对它们的土地的使用和大大增加农业产品和畜牧业产品的产量。集体农庄庄员以及机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员在农业计划方面的创造性的主动精神，将有助于在较短期内解决迅速提高农业的全民任务，使国家拥有足够的粮食、肉类、牛奶、马铃薯、蔬菜和其他农产品，并且能够充分满足工业对原料的需要。
