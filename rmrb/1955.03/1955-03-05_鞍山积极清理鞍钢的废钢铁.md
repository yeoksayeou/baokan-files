From the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's plant area, stretching tens of miles, to the garbage-filled squares outside the plant, workers, organized citizens, and office staff participating in voluntary labor after work are collecting scrap steel every day. This scrap steel has been scattered on the ground and buried in pits and trenches for a long time.

To date, nearly two thousand tons of scrap steel have been collected and transported to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant to be used as raw materials for steelmaking. People have also picked out many machine parts and valuable nonferrous metals such as copper, tungsten, tin, and lead, as well as many large pieces of steel from the scrap steel piles.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company currently regards cleaning up scrap steel as one of its main tasks and expects to have all the accumulated scrap steel cleaned up by the end of March. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍山积极清理鞍钢的废钢铁
    从鞍山钢铁公司纵横几十里路的厂区，直到厂外堆积垃圾的广场，整日都有工人、组织起来的市民和下班后参加义务劳动的机关工作人员在搜集着废钢铁。这些废钢铁是长时期来散乱在地上和埋藏在坑沟里的。
    到现在已经有将近两千吨的废钢铁，被搜集起来运到鞍山钢铁公司砰铁厂去作炼钢的原料了。人们还从废钢铁堆里挑出了许多机器零件和价值贵重的紫铜、钨、锡和铅，还有许多大块钢铁块。
    鞍山钢铁公司目前将清理废钢铁作为主要工作之一，预计到三月末可以把过去堆积的废钢铁全部清理完。（新华社）
