Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 9th: Tokyo dispatch: After activities in South Korea, Harold Stassen, Director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, arrived in Tokyo on the evening of the 8th.

Upon arrival in Tokyo, Stassen issued a statement saying that his visit to Japan was to discuss with the Japanese government the issue of the new U.S. "aid" plan for Asian countries. Stassen's speech at the Bangkok conference clearly stated that the United States wants Japan to play a major role in this new U.S. "aid" plan for Asian countries.

The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo issued an official statement simultaneously with Stassen's arrival in Tokyo, quoting Stassen as saying: "He (Stassen) will only promise American support for sound economic aid plans, without arousing any unrealistic hopes." This exposes the U.S.'s intention of putting the economies of the "recipient" countries on the track prescribed by the United States with its so-called new "aid," while also pouring cold water on the hopes of the Japanese government. The Hatoyama Cabinet passed a plan on the 8th to be submitted to Stassen. According to this plan, Japan will "aid" and participate in the development of Southeast Asia together with the United States, rather than being completely under the control of the United States. At the same time, Japan also hopes that the United States will reduce Japan's burden of disguised occupation fees, relax the dollar terms for surplus U.S. aid agricultural products, and increase military orders. However, the United States has made it clear that any increase in U.S. "aid" must be conditional on Japan accelerating its rearmament.

According to United Press, the main issues to be discussed between Stassen and the Japanese government include "trade with communist countries." International News Service pointed out: "Stassen believes that encouraging Japan to trade with Southeast Asia to meet Japan's economic needs is much more desirable than the irritating ban on trade with communist China." This shows that the U.S. ruling group is attempting to use Japan to squeeze out the economic interests of countries such as Britain and France in Southeast Asia in order to prevent Japan from developing trade with peaceful and democratic countries.

    史塔生到东京进行活动
   【新华社九日讯】东京消息：美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在南朝鲜活动后，已经在八日晚到达东京。
    史塔生一到达东京就发表声明表示：他来日本是要和日本政府会谈美国对亚洲国家的新“援助”计划问题。史塔生在曼谷会议上的演说已经清楚地说明，美国要使日本在美国的这种对亚洲国家的新“援助”计划里起主要作用。
    美国驻东京大使馆在史塔生到达东京的同时发表了一个官方声明，这个声明引史塔生的话说：“他（史塔生）将只是对健全的经济援助计划答应给予美国的支持，而不引起任何不现实的希望”。这就暴露出美国的所谓新“援助”的目的是要把受“援”国的经济纳上美国所规定的轨道，同时也给日本政府的希望泼了一盆冷水。鸠山内阁在八日通过了一个准备提交给史塔生的计划。按照这个计划，日本将和美国一道“援助”和参加东南亚的开发，而不是完全处于美国的支配之下。同时，日本也希望美国削减日本所负担的变相占领费，放宽美援剩余农产品的美元条款，增加军需订货。但是，美国已表明，任何美“援”的增加，必须以日本加速重整军备为条件。
    据合众社透露，在史塔生将要和日本政府会谈的主要问题里包括“对共产党国家的贸易”。国际新闻社指出：“史塔生认为，鼓励日本同东南亚贸易以适应日本的经济需要，要比激人恼怒的对共产党中国贸易的禁令更为可取得多。”这说明了美国统治集团企图利用日本去排挤英、法等国在东南亚的经济利益，以阻挠日本同和平民主国家发展贸易。
