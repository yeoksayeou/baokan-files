    Dereliction of Duty Causes Major Casualties
    Li Senlin Sentenced to Five Years

    The Harbin Railway Transportation Court held a public trial in Shenyang on February 21st, sentencing Li Senlin, the perpetrator in a case of dereliction of duty causing a major accident with eighteen casualties, to five years in prison.

    Li Senlin was originally a level crossing keeper at the Shenyang Railway Works Section. On December 21, 1954, while on duty at the Ligong Street crossing in Tiexi District, Shenyang, at around 18:00, he left his post without authorization and crossed the tracks to look at a tractor parked 14 meters away from the crossing, chatting idly with the tractor driver. At this time, Li Kun, a driver from the Shenyang Locomotive Depot, was driving a locomotive under the guidance of switchman Pan Guogui from Shenyang Station, performing shunting operations on the Tiexi dedicated line. The locomotive was traveling in reverse from east to west. Simultaneously, a truck from the Shenyang Battery Factory, fully loaded with employees returning from a Party member's meeting, was traveling south from the north. Although Li Senlin noticed that the locomotive and the truck would simultaneously arrive at the crossing as he was walking back, he was too far from his post and was unable to lower the barrier or use a signal lamp, as he did not have one with him. This led to the locomotive's tender coupler colliding with the rear of the truck, causing the truck to be violently pushed 13.9 meters. Eighteen Party members and cadres, including the deputy director and section chief of the battery factory, were injured or killed. One person died on the spot, five were seriously injured, and twelve were slightly injured.

    擅离职守造成重大伤亡事故
    李森林被判处五年徒刑
    哈尔滨铁路运输法院二月二十一日在沈阳举行公开审判大会，判处擅离职守造成十八人重大伤亡事故案犯李森林有期徒刑五年。
    李森林原是沈阳铁路工务段道口看守员，一九五四年十二月二十一日，在沈阳铁西区励工街道口当班时，于十八点左右擅自离开工作岗位，越过线路去看停留在距离道口十四公尺远的拖拉机，并同拖拉机司机闲谈。此时沈阳机务段司机李锟驾驶着机车，由沈阳站调车员潘国贵引导，在铁西专用线上进行调车作业，机车逆向自东往西行驶。同时有沈阳电池厂的汽车一辆，满载着开完党员大会的职工，从北向南行驶。李森林在往回走时，虽然发现机车和汽车将同时行至道口处，但因擅离工作地点较远，既来不及放下挡杆，又未随身携带信号灯，已无法制止，致机车煤水车大钩和汽车尾部相撞，汽车被斜撞出十三点九公尺。在汽车上坐的电池厂副厂长、科长等党员干部伤亡十八人，其中当场死亡一人，重伤五人，轻伤十二人。
