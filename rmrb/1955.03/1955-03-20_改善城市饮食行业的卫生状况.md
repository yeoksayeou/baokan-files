    Improving Hygiene in the Urban Food Service Industry

    Recently, some readers have raised concerns in their letters about the need to improve hygiene in the urban food service industry, which is a matter worthy of attention.

    The quality of hygiene in the urban food service industry is directly related to the health of the general population. Over the past few years, through numerous patriotic health campaigns, significant achievements have been made in both urban and rural sanitation work, and the hygiene conditions in the food service industry have also improved to some extent. However, judging from recent reader letters, many health authorities still do not attach enough importance to this work and have not earnestly strengthened the management and supervision of food hygiene. Consequently, serious neglect of hygiene exists in some food supply departments and private food service businesses.

    Private food service businesses constitute the largest number in the urban food service industry, and unsanitary conditions are more serious. For example, in Tianjin alone, there are more than 4,730 private restaurants, food stores, meat businesses, tofu workshops, and other food service establishments, employing over 18,800 people, while there are only over 500 state-owned food enterprises. According to readers, unhygienic conditions in the food service industry exist in the processes of food manufacturing, processing, storage, and sales. Some small restaurants have rudimentary equipment and often use rotten and spoiled meat for dishes, and sell vegetables that have not been washed as fillings. Some chefs in restaurants still use outdated operating methods, taking soup from the pot with a spoon to taste and then pouring the remaining soup back into the pot. The cleanliness of tools is a very important issue in food manufacturing and processing, but many people do not pay attention to this. Many readers point out that the rags in restaurants and food shops are the most unsanitary and are a medium for spreading germs. Many food service businesses do not use separate rags; instead, they often use the same rag to wipe tables, chopsticks, stoves, hands, and even noses. Furthermore, the lack of disinfection of utensils such as bowls and chopsticks and the common practice of sick and healthy people using them interchangeably are widespread. Some food service businesses do not pay attention to dust and insect prevention in food storage and other hygienic practices; unclean items are often found in food, and some food is even rotten and spoiled. More seriously, some private merchants process and sell rotten and foul-smelling meat to the masses. In addition, the food sold by some small vendors is even more unsanitary. Especially the toy-like foods made and sold specifically for children, such as cigarette candies, Beijing cakes, and hawthorn cloths, easily spread bacteria. Children often play with these foods before eating them, further increasing the level of dirtiness. Readers have reported that cases of children becoming ill and dying from acute gastroenteritis and acute bacillary dysentery after eating unclean food have occurred in cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai.

    Unhygienic conditions also exist in some state-owned food supply departments. Readers have exposed the poor business practices of some regional food companies that sell spoiled meat, canned goods, eggs, and rotten fruits. For example, the Shangrao City Food Company and the Changsha City Food Company have both sold pork contaminated with infectious germs to the public, creating a very negative impact. The Baoding City Food Company has repeatedly sold rotten and spoiled oranges and bananas, causing many customers to suffer from stomach problems. Despite repeated education from the health and epidemic prevention authorities, they have evaded and prevaricated, refusing to accept advice. This business practice that disregards the people's health is extremely wrong.

    The reason for the poor food hygiene in cities is mainly due to the capitalist business ideology existing in some state-owned food enterprises and the unscrupulous profiteering attitude of many private food service businesses that disregard the people's health. Some private merchants hold the attitude that "hygiene or lack thereof has nothing to do with me, as long as I can make money," so they are unwilling to spend money on adding hygiene equipment and improving hygiene conditions. Some food service employees lack necessary hygiene knowledge and have not developed personal hygiene habits, and they do not adequately recognize the importance of hygiene work in serving production. These issues should be corrected.

    The central link in improving hygiene in the urban food service industry lies in strengthening the education of food service employees and strengthening the inspection, supervision, and management of food hygiene. Urban health authorities and grassroots epidemic prevention organizations should regularly conduct hygiene knowledge education in the food service industry, making them aware of the significant relationship between food hygiene and the health of the broad masses of people and the national construction cause. In addition, management measures for hygiene work in the food service industry should be formulated to strengthen the inspection and supervision of the food manufacturing, processing, and sales processes. Appropriate rewards should be given to those who do well, and necessary punishments should be given to those who seriously endanger people's health and repeatedly refuse to correct their behavior after being educated. Currently, some cities have carried out mass inspections and evaluations of model hygiene units in the private food service industry, which have achieved good results and should be advocated and promoted in various places.

### 改善城市饮食行业的卫生状况

    改善城市饮食行业的卫生状况
    最近，有些读者在来信中提出了应当改善城市饮食行业卫生状况的问题，这是一件值得注意的事情。
    城市饮食行业卫生状况的好坏，同广大人民的身体健康有着直接的关系。几年来，经过多次爱国卫生运动，城市和农村的卫生工作都取得了很大的成绩，饮食行业的卫生状况也有了一定的改进。但是，从最近读者来信中看，还有很多卫生机关对这一工作重视不够，没有认真地加强对食品卫生的管理和监督，因此，有些食品供应部门和私营饮食行业存在着严重的忽视卫生的情况。
    城市饮食行业中私营饮食行业的数量最多，不卫生的现象也比较严重。如天津市私营的饭铺、食品店、肉食业、豆腐坊等饮食行业就有四千七百三十多户，从业员一万八千八百多人，而国营的食品企业仅有五百多处。据读者反映，饮食行业中不卫生的情况在食品的制造、加工、保管和销售过程中都是存在的。有些小饭铺设备简陋，常常用腐烂变质的肉作菜，把没有洗涤过的蔬菜用来作馅子出卖。有些饭铺炒菜的厨师仍然沿用着旧的操作方法，在炒菜时用勺子在锅内取汤放在嘴上尝后仍把剩余的汤倒回锅内。在食品的制造、加工中，工具的清洁是一个十分重要的问题，但是许多人并不注意这些。许多读者指出，饭铺、饮食店中的抹布是最不清洁的，是传染病菌的媒介。很多饮食业的抹布都不能分别使用，常常是用同一块抹布擦桌子、擦碗筷、擦炉台、擦手、甚至擦鼻子等。其他如碗、筷等用具不进行消毒，病人和健康的人轮流使用的现象也是很普遍的。有些饮食业在食品的保管上不注意防尘、防虫等清洁卫生工作，食品中经常发现一些不清洁的东西，甚至有的食品已经腐烂变质了。更严重的是有些私商把腐烂了的臭肉加工后卖给群众。此外，有些小摊贩所出售的食品，不卫生的情况更加严重。特别是专门制售为儿童喜欢的玩具性食品，如烟卷糖、京糕、红果布等很容易传播细菌。儿童拿到这些食品后多半是先玩后吃，更增加了食品的脏污程度。读者来信中提出，天津、上海等城市都曾发生过儿童吃了不清洁的食品而患急性胃肠炎和急性杆菌痢疾等病死的事情。
    食品不卫生的情况在某些国营食品供应部门也是存在的。读者揭发了有些地区的食品公司出售变质的肉类、罐头、蛋品、腐烂了的水果等恶劣的经营作风。如上饶市食品公司和长沙市食品公司都曾把带有传染病菌的猪肉出售给群众，造成极不好的影响。保定市食品公司曾经几次出售腐烂变质的桔子、香蕉等，许多顾客食后患胃肠病；卫生防疫机关事前一再对他们进行教育，他们却一味支吾搪塞，不接受意见。这种不顾人民身体健康的经营作风是十分错误的。
    城市食品卫生状况不好的原因，主要是某些国营食品企业存在着资本主义的经营思想和许多私营饮食行业不顾人民健康的唯利是图的恶劣作风所造成的。有些私商抱着“卫生不卫生对我没有关系，反正能赚钱就行”的态度，因此他们舍不得拿出钱来增添卫生设备和改善卫生条件；也有些饮食行业的从业人员缺乏必要的卫生知识和没有养成个人卫生的习惯，他们对卫生工作为生产服务的重要意义认识不足。这些都应当加以纠正。
    改善城市饮食行业卫生状况的中心环节在于：加强对饮食行业从业人员的教育，加强对食品卫生情况的检查、监督和管理。城市卫生机关和基层卫生防疫组织应当经常在饮食行业中进行有关卫生知识的宣传教育，使他们认识到食品卫生和广大人民群众的身体健康以及国家建设事业的重大关系。此外，还应当制订关于饮食行业卫生工作的管理办法，对食品的制造、加工、销售过程加强检查和监督，对于好的应当予以适当的奖励，对于严重危害人民健康而屡教不改的应给予必要的处分。现在，有些城市在私营饮食行业中开展群众的检查和评选模范卫生单位的工作，就曾收到了良好的效果，应该号召各地学习和推广这种办法。  杜边
