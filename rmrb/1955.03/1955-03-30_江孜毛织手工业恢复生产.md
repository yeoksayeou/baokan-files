Gyangzê woolen handicraft workers, who suffered from a flood in 1954, have fully resumed production with the help of the People's Bank of China and state-owned trading companies. Since the beginning of spring, the sound of looms can be heard everywhere in the urban area of Gyangzê and some villages in the suburbs. The market is also booming with the trade of various pulu and carpets.

Gyangzê is a famous woolen handicraft city in Tibet. There are thousands of woolen handicraft households in the urban area and nearby rural areas. The pulu, carpets, and cushions produced here are sold to Tibet, Xikang, and Qinghai. After Gyangzê suffered a flood in 1954, the People's Bank of China issued interest-free loans of more than 7,000 yuan to help hundreds of long-term handicraft workers in the urban area resume production first. State-owned trading companies have successively purchased more than 5,000 yuan worth of woolen products, and led and organized Tibetan merchants to supply handicraft workers with grain, tea, and wool. During this period, the Gyangzê Disaster Relief Committee distributed relief grain to handicraft workers. Now some of the disaster-stricken households have built new houses and added looms and other production tools. The state-owned trading company has decided to purchase more than 10,000 rolls of pulu (each roll about fifty feet) this year, and transport them to Xikang and Qinghai through the Kangzang and Qingzang highways to exchange for daily necessities from the interior. It also plans to lend some foot-operated spinning wheels to help handicraft workers improve their technology.

    江孜毛织手工业恢复生产
    一九五四年遭受水灾的江孜市毛织手工业者，在中国人民银行和国营贸易公司帮助下，已全部恢复了生产。开春以来，江孜市区和郊区的一些村落里一片织机声。市场上各色氆氇和花毯的交易也很旺盛。
    江孜是西藏著名的毛织手工业城市，市区和附近农村有上千家毛织手工业户，这里产的氆氇、花毯、花垫，行销西藏、西康和青海各地。江孜在一九五四年遭受水灾后，中国人民银行发放了七千多元的无息贷款，首先帮助市区上百户长年手工业者恢复了生产。国营贸易公司先后收购了价值五千多元的毛织产品，并领导组织藏族商人供应手工业者粮食、茶叶和羊毛等。在此期间，江孜救灾委员会向手工业者发放了救济粮。现在一部分受灾户已盖起了新房舍，添置了木机等生产工具。国营贸易公司决定今年收购氆氇一万多卷（每卷五丈左右），通过康藏、青藏公路运销西康和青海，换回内地日用品，还准备贷放一部分脚踏毛纺车，帮助手工业者改进技术。
