    Careful Investigation and Calculation are Needed to Correctly Define Distribution Ratios
    Yang Ye
    The issue of distribution ratios in agricultural production cooperatives is the most important specific policy problem in the agricultural cooperativization movement. It is closely related to the policy of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, and it is directly related to whether cooperatives can increase production and whether members can increase their income. If the returns on means of production are set too low, members will not be motivated to invest, and those with less labor will become ideologically unstable. If the returns on labor are set too low, members will not be motivated to produce, and those with fewer means of production will lose their enthusiasm. At the same time, if this problem within the cooperative is not resolved well, it will have a significant impact on the thinking of farmers outside the cooperative, and it will be detrimental to the further development of the entire rural production movement and cooperativization movement.
    What kind of distribution ratio is considered appropriate? The principle is that the increased production should be shared by both middle and poor peasants. That is to say, the actual income of middle and poor peasants should be somewhat higher than before joining the cooperative, except for special reasons. The specific numbers that should be determined should be decided according to the different situations of each locality and each cooperative. It cannot be determined solely by the subjective assumptions of a few cadres. In order to correctly implement the policy, it is necessary to rely on the masses to conduct in-depth and careful investigations and calculations to find a ratio that benefits both poor and middle peasants.
    According to a letter from Comrade Xu Gong of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Xuanhua City Committee in Hebei Province: There was an agricultural production cooperative in Yangjiashan Village, Pangjiabao District, Xuanhua City, which collapsed after two years of operation. The city committee sent four people to investigate six times and tried six different methods to make detailed calculations. Finally, it was proven that the reason for the collapse was a problem with the distribution system.
    The cooperative stipulated that land remuneration should, in principle, be based on the fixed annual actual output assessed at the time of the establishment of the cooperative, and a "fixed rent" of 40% should be deducted. For land that was far away and fragmented, some was reduced; for land that was close and well-shaped, some was increased. Agricultural taxes were borne by the landowners themselves (approximately equal to half of the land remuneration). The cooperative's production funds were not borne by the land. As a result of this distribution in 1954: land remuneration accounted for 33.07% of the total value of agricultural products; production costs accounted for 39.67%; public accumulation fund and public welfare fund accounted for 1.9%; and labor remuneration accounted for only 25.36%. If costs were deducted first, and calculated based on the net agricultural income, land remuneration accounted for 54%, public accumulation fund and public welfare fund accounted for 7%, and labor income accounted for only 39%.
    The cooperative's labor income from agriculture and sideline occupations was distributed uniformly. In 1954, 70% of the total income from sideline occupations (mainly transportation) was given to the donkey owners, and 30% was distributed uniformly to the cooperative's labor force. Adding up the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations, the labor remuneration accounted for only 27.3%. The total labor used in agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year was 2,000 workdays, with an average of only 10,108 yuan (old currency, same below) per "workday," which was not even the actual wage of an ordinary short-term worker for one day.
    Of the 13 households in the cooperative, 11 households had 16 donkeys, with a total value of 27.4 million yuan. The cooperative stipulated that donkeys were privately owned, and the cooperative hired them for agricultural work. During the busy season in summer and autumn, each "workday" was 10,000 yuan, and during the slack season in winter and spring, each "workday" was 7,000 yuan. The income from sideline occupations (transportation) was distributed on the basis of one human workday being equal to one donkey "workday." The income from human workdays was handed over to the cooperative and distributed uniformly with the agricultural labor income after the autumn harvest. The income from donkey "workdays" was all handed over to the donkey owners at that time. When there was no agricultural work in winter, everyone did sideline occupations on their own.
    By the time of the autumn harvest distribution in 1954, the income from donkey "workdays" totaled more than 31.75 million yuan, exceeding the total value of the donkeys (of which about 78% came from sideline occupations and about 22% came from agriculture). The total amount of income from donkey "workdays" was more than the income from human workdays, equivalent to more than 150% of the income from human workdays.
    As a result, most cooperative members (especially those with more land, more investment, and more donkeys, including the cooperative leader) were not active enough in agricultural production. Of the 17 laborers in the cooperative, three almost never participated in labor within the cooperative throughout the year; on average, two people did not participate in the cooperative's labor every day. Some said: "I rely on my two donkeys!" Some thought: "I count on those few stones of rent." Cooperative members whose income mainly came from donkey "workdays," led by the cooperative leader, all exchanged a good donkey for two bad donkeys in order to earn more income. When conflicts arose between agriculture and sideline occupations, they also advocated making agriculture subordinate to sideline occupations. In 1954, when summer weeding was in full swing, the cooperative was originally short of labor, but the cooperative members with two donkeys, led by the cooperative leader, ignored the agricultural work and only cared about driving their donkeys to earn cash, delaying the weeding of the fields.
    Why did this unreasonable phenomenon occur? The main reason was that the cadres sent by the Xuanhua City Committee to lead the establishment of the cooperative did not carefully investigate and calculate beforehand. They simply believed that as long as a fixed rent system for land was implemented, it would definitely improve labor enthusiasm. They only thought about rewarding cooperative members for raising more livestock, but did not think about what would happen if the livestock's "wages" squeezed out the labor income. They even thought that these were "superior strategies" for promoting production and developing cooperatives! As a result, contrary to their subjective wishes, agricultural production did not improve, and the cooperative collapsed.
    Is there something wrong with the fixed rent system for land? We cannot say that. In a certain period, fixed land remuneration is good in principle. It can stabilize the emotions of people with more land and improve labor enthusiasm. However, it cannot be implemented under any conditions. At least, it should also be seen: who bears the production funds? Is the output stable?
    According to calculations based on the situation in several places in Pangjiabao District, if the main means of production are converted according to market prices, production costs account for about 40% of the total value of agricultural products. The remaining 60% of net income, based on the principle that labor remuneration should be higher than land remuneration, land remuneration should be about 40% of the net income, which is equivalent to about 24% of the total output value. If this standard is set as a "fixed rent," it is too far from the social customary rental rate, and it is not easy for farmers (especially middle peasants with more land) to accept it for a while. However, if it exceeds this standard, the labor force will suffer too much.
    What should be done in this situation? If the fixed rent system for land is still adopted, and the rent is determined according to the social customary rental rate, in the first year of establishing the cooperative, members should pay a share fund according to their respective land output (no interest is paid, and it can be taken away in full when withdrawing from the cooperative). If the land rent is reduced, the share fund can also be borne jointly by labor and land. In the second year and subsequent years, the production funds should be deducted from the total income of the entire cooperative according to actual needs, no longer distributed to individual members, and no longer shared by members (when more funds are needed to expand production, members can be mobilized to invest and given appropriate interest). In the event of a disaster, land remuneration should be reduced appropriately.
    Under the fixed rent system for land, the cooperative's remuneration to the owners of livestock and large farm implements, and the interest on cooperative members' investments, are actually borne by the labor force. This is unreasonable. This issue must be taken into account when determining the land rent. (Of course, when livestock and large farm implements are owned by the entire cooperative, this issue is relatively simple.)
    In short, to correctly handle the distribution ratio issue of agricultural production cooperatives, on the one hand, we must firmly grasp the policy of benefiting both poor and middle peasants, and on the other hand, we must promote a style of meticulous investigation and calculation. Only through careful investigation and meticulous calculation can we correctly and completely implement the Party's policies. The lessons learned by Yangjiashan Village on this issue are something we should remember.

    周密地调查计算才能正确地规定分配比例
    杨叶
    农业生产合作社的分配比例问题，是农业合作化运动当中最重要的一个具体政策问题，是和依靠贫农、团结中农的政策有最密切的关系的一个问题，也是和社里能不能提高生产、社员能不能增加收入有直接关系的一个问题，如果生产资料的收益规定得太少，社员就会不积极投资，劳力较少的人就会思想动荡不定；如果劳力的收益规定得少，社员就会不积极生产，生产资料较少的人就会提不起精神来。同时，社内的这个问题解决得不好，对社外农民的思想也会发生重大的影响，对整个农村的生产运动和合作化运动的进一步开展也都是不利的。
    分配比例怎样才算恰好呢？原则是增产的部分要使中农和贫农都能分得。就是说要使中农和贫农的实际收入，除有特殊原因的以外，都能比入社以前多少增加一些。究竟应该确定怎样的具体数目，那就要根据各地各社的不同的情况来决定，决不是只凭少数干部主观的设想就能够规定得好的。为了正确地贯彻政策，必须依靠群众作深入的周密的调查和计算，找出既利于贫农也利于中农的比例。
    据中共河北省宣化市委办公室徐攻同志来信：宣化市庞家堡区杨家山村有一个农业生产合作社，办了两年，终于垮台了。市委派了四个人调查了六次，试用了六种不同的方法作了详细的计算；最后证明，垮台的原因是分配制度有问题。
    这个社规定，土地报酬原则上以建社时候评定的常年实产量为标准，按四成抽“死租”。地远块碎的，减去一些；地近块整的，增加一些。农业税由地户自己负担（约等于土地报酬的一半）。社里的生产资金不归土地负担。一九五四年这样分配的结果：土地报酬占农产品总值的百分之三十三点零七；生产成本占百分之三十九点六七；公积金、公益金占百分之一点九；劳力报酬只占百分之二十五点三六。如果先扣除成本，按农业纯收益计算，土地报酬占百分之五十四，公积金、公益金占百分之七，劳力所得只占百分之三十九。
    这个社的农业和副业的劳力收入是统一分配的。一九五四年全年的副业（主要是运输）总收入，百分之七十归驴主，百分之三十归社里的劳力统一分配。把农业和副业总收入加起来算，劳力的报酬只占百分之二十七点三。全年农业副业共用人工二千个，平均每“工”只能分一万零一百零八元（旧币，下同），还不足一个普通短工一天的实际工资。
    全社十三户，其中十一户有毛驴十六头，总值二千七百四十万元。社里规定毛驴私有，做农活时由社雇用，夏秋忙季每“工”一万元，冬春闲季每“工”七千元。搞副业（运输）的收入按一个人工等于一个驴“工”进行分配。人工收入交给社里同农业劳力收入一起秋后统一分配，驴“工”收入当时全部交归驴主。冬天没有农活时，副业是各干各的。
    到一九五四年秋收分配的时候为止，驴“工”收入共约三千一百七十五万多元，超过了毛驴的总值（其中从副业方面得到的约占牲畜收入的百分之七十八，从农业方面得到的约占牲畜收入的百分之二十二）。驴“工”收入总额，比人工收入还多，等于人工收入的百分之一百五十以上。
    这样一来，多数社员（特别是土地多、投资多、毛驴多的社员，包括社长在内）在农业生产方面都不够积极。全社十七个劳动力，有三个人几乎全年不参加社内劳动；平均每天有两人不参加社里的劳动。有的说：“我就仗我这两头毛驴哩！”有的想：“我就指望那几石租子。”以驴“工”收入为主的社员，以社长为首，都把一头好驴换成两头坏驴，以牟取更多的收入。在农业和副业发生矛盾时，他们还主张让农业服从副业。一九五四年夏锄正忙时，社内劳力本来不够用，但有两头毛驴的社员，以社长为首，竟把农活撂下不管，只顾自己赶毛驴赚现钱，耽误了大田锄苗。
    为什么会发生这种不合理的现象呢？主要原因是宣化市委派去领导建社的干部，事先没有仔细地调查和算账。他们简单地认为：只要实行土地死租制，就一定能提高劳动积极性。只想到要奖励社员多养牲口，却没有想到牲口得“工资”挤掉劳力收入会发生什么后果。他们还认为这些是促进生产和发展合作社的“上策”哩！结果，和他们的主观愿望恰恰相反：农业生产没有提高，社也垮了。
    是不是土地死租制有毛病呢？不能这样说。在一定时期内土地固定报酬，原则上是好的，既能稳定土地较多的人的情绪，又能提高劳动积极性。但是，并不是在任何条件下都可以实行的。至少，还应当看到：生产资金是由谁负担的？产量是不是稳定？
    根据庞家堡区几个地方的情况计算，主要生产资料如果按市价折算，生产成本约占农产品总值的百分之四十；余下来的百分之六十的纯收益，根据劳力报酬较高于土地报酬的原则，土地报酬应在纯收益的百分之四十左右，即等于总产值的百分之二十四左右。如果以这个标准定成“死租”，距离社会上的习惯租率太远，农民（尤其是土地比较多的中农）一时不易接受。可是，如果高出这个标准，劳力就会吃亏太大。
    在这种情况下，该怎么办呢？如果仍然采用土地死租制，而且按照社会习惯租率确定租额，在办社的第一年应当由社员按各自的土地产量交纳股份基金（不行利息，退社时可以如数带走）。如果把土地租额降低，也可以由劳力和土地共同负担股份基金。第二年和以后的生产资金，应当在全社总收入中按实际需要扣除，不再分给社员个人，也不再要社员分摊（为了扩大生产需要更多资金时，可以发动社员投资，给以适当的利息）。在受灾时，土地报酬应当酌量降低。
    实行土地死租制，社里给牲畜、大农具的物主的报酬和给社员投资的利息等等，实际上是由劳力负担的。这是不合理的。在规定土地租额时，必须考虑到这个问题。（当然，在牲畜、大农具为全社公有的情况下，这个问题就比较简单了。）
    总之，要正确地处理农业生产合作社的分配比例问题，一方面必须紧紧掌握贫农中农两利的政策，一方面还要提倡精细调查计算的作风。只有经过周密的调查和精细的计算，才能正确地完满地执行党的政策。杨家山村在这个问题上得到的教训，是我们应当记取的。
