Huge temporary flood control projects are being constructed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. This temporary flood control project is intended to strengthen the flood control capacity of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Before the large reservoirs in the middle reaches are completed, the flood control capacity of the dikes on both sides will be gradually improved, so that the downstream can defend against abnormal floods of 29,000 cubic meters per second, which occur once every two hundred years. This will ensure the safety of tens of millions of people downstream and the country's economic construction, and ensure the smooth progress of permanent control projects. This project includes the construction of flood detention projects at appropriate locations and a comprehensive overhaul of the dikes on both sides.

This year's dike repair projects in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and its tributaries, the lower reaches of the Qin River, and Dongping Lake are mostly temporary flood control measures, with only a small portion being routine maintenance. The total earthwork for the two items is more than 32 million cubic meters, a scale larger than any previous year in history. The dam and revetment works are also much larger than general annual repairs, with a planned use of more than 365,000 cubic meters of stone. The Yellow River management agencies of Henan and Shandong provinces, and the Party and government organs at all levels along the river, began preparations before the Spring Festival. Construction started in various counties and sections from late February. At present, there are about 180,000 migrant workers participating in dike repair along the river (including the lower reaches of the Qin River, a tributary of the Yellow River). The first phase of the project has been completed in Zhengzhou and other sections of Henan Province where construction started early. The first phase of the project in Changyuan and Puyang counties in Henan Province and Shouzhang County in Shandong Province is nearing completion. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    黄河下游兴修巨大的临时防洪工程
    黄河下游正在修建规模巨大的临时防洪工程。这个临时性的防洪工程，是为了加强黄河下游的防洪能力，使下游能在中游大水库建成以前，逐步提高两岸堤坝的防洪能力，达到能够防御黄河二百年一遇的二万九千秒公方流量的异常洪水，以保障下游数千万人民的安全和国家的经济建设，并使治本工程得以顺利进行。这一工程，包括在适当地点增建滞洪工程和对两岸堤坝普遍大修一次。
    今年黄河下游及其支流沁河下游和东平湖的修堤工程，绝大部分属于临时防洪措施，仅有一小部分是岁修。两项土方共有三千二百多万公方，规模之大，超过历史上的任何一年。坝埽工程也较一般岁修大得多，共计划用石料三十六万五千多公方。河南和山东两省治黄机关和沿河各级党、政机关，在春节前就开始进行准备工作。从二月下旬起，各县段陆续开工。现在，沿河两岸（包括黄河支流沁河的下游）参加修堤的民工已有十八万人左右。开工早的河南省郑州等段已完成第一期工程。河南省长垣、濮阳和山东省寿张等县段的第一期工程已接近完成。　（据新华社讯）
