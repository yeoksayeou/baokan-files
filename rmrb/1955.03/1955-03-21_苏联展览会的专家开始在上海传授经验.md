(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th) More than 100 Soviet experts who came to Shanghai with the Soviet Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction have begun to share their experiences with Shanghai's engineers, workers, teachers, railway workers, scientists, and artists.

　　Engineers from the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory invited two Soviet experts proficient in grinding machines to the factory on the 19th to guide the trial production of the Soviet-style 3160 universal cylindrical grinding machine and hydraulic cylinders that are currently underway. Soviet experts are very concerned about factories such as the jointly-owned state-private Dalong Machine Factory, which began mass-producing petroleum machinery parts this year, and personally went to the factories to help solve technical problems. Since the end of January, Soviet locomotive experts have given six reports to the employees of the Shanghai Locomotive Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration, introducing advanced technical experiences in Soviet railways. Another Soviet railway signaling expert has lectured to teachers at the Shanghai Railway School eleven times, and specifically explained the automatic railway blocking device at the exhibition.

　　Every morning, professors from the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts bring their painting tools to the art gallery of the exhibition to copy those world-famous oil paintings, and at the same time, they talk with Soviet artists about their painting experiences. More than 40 art workers from the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association are also preparing to join this study group. They also invited Soviet art experts to lecture on six special topics related to art work.

　　As of the 19th, Soviet experts who came to Shanghai with the exhibition have held more than 50 lectures, reports, and seminars. The exhibition office also continues to receive letters requesting Soviet experts to answer questions or obtain information.

    苏联展览会的专家开始在上海传授经验
   【新华社上海二十日电】随苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会来上海的一百多位苏联专家，已开始向上海的工程师、工人、教师、铁路工作者、科学工作者和艺术工作者们传授经验。
    国营上海机床厂的工程师们，十九日邀请两位精通磨床的苏联专家到厂，指导正在进行的苏联式三一六零外圆磨床和油压筒的试制工作。苏联专家对今年开始大量制造石油机械配件的公私合营大隆机器厂等工厂非常关心，亲自下厂协助解决技术问题。苏联机车专家从一月底开始，已陆续给上海铁路管理局上海机务段的员工做了六次报告，介绍苏联铁路方面的先进技术经验。另一位苏联铁路信号专家先后为上海铁路学校的教师讲课十一次，并具体讲解了展览会上的自动铁路闭塞装置。
    每天清晨，中央美术学院华东分院的教授们就带着画具，来到展览会美术馆，临摹那些世界驰名的油画，同时和苏联美术家交谈绘画的心得。中国美术家协会上海分会的四十多位美术工作者，也准备参加这支学习队伍。他们并邀请苏联美术专家讲授有关美术工作的六个专题。
    截至十九日为止，随展览会来上海的苏联专家们已经举行了五十多次的讲课、报告和座谈。展览会办公室还不断收到要求苏联专家解答问题或索取资料的来信。
