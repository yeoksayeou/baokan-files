In the past ten days, over 1,000 people, including Tibetan officials, abbots of monasteries, members of the Patriotic Women's Federation and the Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, representatives of residents, and students from Lhasa primary schools, have participated in the propaganda and signature collection activities against the use of atomic weapons. People from all walks of life in Lhasa have published articles and speeches on the Tibetan-language "News Briefs" and cable radio stations. Gadan Chiba (the Gadan Monastery abbot who inherits the lineage of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism) Awang Gongga said in a radio broadcast: "We Tibetan Buddhists, like people all over the world, advocate peace. Each of us firmly opposes the U.S. imperialism's attempt to use atomic weapons."

At a mass signature rally against the use of atomic weapons held by people of all ethnic groups in Xigaze on the 9th, more than 10,000 people signed the "Open Letter to the People of the World." In the towns of Gyantse, Phari, and Yatung, more than 3,000 Tibetan people from all walks of life have signed the petition. Officials, chieftains of thousands and hundreds, leaders, citizens, and Tibetan and Han staff members in Nagqu, an important town in northern Tibet, jointly held a rally against the use of atomic weapons on the 6th, with more than 600 attendees signing the petition. In the Ali pastoral area, more than 2,000 kilometers away from Lhasa, the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has also been launched.

Currently, the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in various parts of Tibet is developing towards the vast rural areas and pastures.

Tibetan and Han residents of Qamdo, lamas from Qamdo Lamasery, staff members of various agencies, and others have gathered to sign the petition in recent days. The people of Dengqen held a signature rally against the use of atomic weapons on the 7th, with more than 1,000 people, including headmen, farmers, and herdsmen, signing the petition. Since late February, people in Qamdo, Dengqen, Bomi and other places have successively organized signature campaign committees against the use of atomic weapons. Local Tibetan figures, headmen, representatives of monasteries, and Tibetan students have actively participated in the publicity activities.

Xinhua News Agency report: The signature campaign in various medium and small cities in Xinjiang Province has basically ended. According to incomplete statistics as of March 10th, more than 900,500 people have signed the petition, accounting for nearly one-fifth of the total population of the province.

The signature campaign progressed rapidly in various cities. In Urumqi, the number of signatures reached more than 104,000 in just over 20 days, accounting for more than 90 percent of the city's total population. In most of the medium and small cities distributed in the remote areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, although the signature campaign only started around February 25th, it had basically ended by March 5th, with the number of signatures generally accounting for more than 80 percent of the local population.

Now the signature campaign has penetrated into remote rural areas and mountainous regions. In the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and the counties of the Urumqi area, more than 2,000 propagandists of various ethnic groups are conducting in-depth publicity activities against the use of atomic weapons in rural areas and grasslands.

Xinhua News Agency report: The signature campaign of the vast number of commanders and fighters of various arms of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army against the use of atomic weapons has basically ended. According to preliminary statistics, as of the 10th, more than 95 percent of officers and soldiers in the entire army had signed the "Open Letter to the People of the World."

On February 26th, twelve units of a certain logistics unit launched signature activities simultaneously. Officers and soldiers who were out on missions or recuperating in hospitals also went to nearby units and hospitals to sign the petition. Troops stationed on the forward islands of the east and west coasts of Korea also held signature rallies one after another, and all officers and soldiers signed the "Open Letter to the People of the World."

During the signature campaign, the vast number of officers and soldiers in various units resolutely expressed their determination to oppose the use of atomic weapons and defend peace in Asia and the world with practical actions such as raising vigilance, strictly guarding positions, and striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
