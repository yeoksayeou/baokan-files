Our readers and reporters stationed in Changsha, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other places have continued to expose instances of food waste in some government agencies, enterprises and schools, and have proposed some ways to save food.

Judging from these exposed materials, the phenomenon of food waste is very serious in various places. In February of this year, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate and the Guangzhou Municipal Grain Bureau conducted an inspection of the Guangzhou Port Authority of the Ministry of Transportation, and found that the Port Authority wasted 11,630 catties of cold rice and 9,224 catties of burnt rice in the nearly three and a half months from November 1954 to February 12 this year. They raised more than 50 pigs and hundreds of chickens and ducks, and even sold leftover food. The Chongqing China Wool Textile Factory, with 996 people eating, wastes an average of about 150 catties of congee, 42 catties of pot crust, and nearly 20 steamed buns poured into swill for feeding pigs every day. In the summer of 1954, the factory even used uneaten buns to feed pigs. The Xiehe Hospital in Wuhan wasted enough food to feed 50 people every day.

The main reasons for these large amounts of leftover food are lax management of meals, cooking too much when too little is eaten. Some canteen staff even mistakenly believe, "It is better to cook too much than not enough." Unreasonable systems are also a cause of large-scale food waste. The mess hall of the Tianfu Coal Mine in Beibei, Sichuan Province, treats the money from selling swill as extra income for the cooks. Each dining hall can sell 12 to 21 yuan per month. In order to expand this extra income, some cooks do not hesitate to pour clean, edible food into the swill. A few employees and students do not cherish food and arbitrarily waste it, which is also a cause of waste. The phenomenon of peeling steamed buns and throwing them away after taking a few bites is not isolated. Some students at the Wuhan Municipal Construction Engineering School in Hubei Province casually pour half a bowl of rice into the ditch. Residents near the Wuhan Municipal No. 4 Brick Factory go to their dishwater to scoop up rice after meals, and can scoop out five or six catties each time. At the Chongqing No. 27 Junior High School in Sichuan Province, some students throw leftover rice into the river to feed the fish for entertainment. Some students at the Shulan County No. 2 Junior High School in Heilongjiang Province do not like to eat coarse grains, and scatter it on the ground and on the table whenever they eat coarse rice. About 300 people eat at this school, and 8,100 catties of grain are wasted every year.

These phenomena of food waste have aroused the dissatisfaction of farmers near the units. For example, farmers in Longjingwan, Nanquan, Chongqing, said to the principal of No. 27 Middle School: If you continue to waste food, we will not sell surplus grain in the second half of the year. The farmers' accusations are completely justified. The responsible persons of these units must earnestly listen to the farmers' opinions and quickly correct this wasteful phenomenon.

Some leaders and canteen staff of some units believe that "wasting ten or eight catties a day is nothing" and that "leftover food is a favorable condition for developing sideline occupations (referring to raising pigs and chickens)." These understandings are wrong. Although the amount wasted each day is small, it adds up to a lot over time. Moreover, even a small amount of waste is very inappropriate. It is permissible to use leftover vegetables and food to raise pigs and chickens, but it is not permissible to deliberately leave leftovers, or to increase leftovers due to poor planning, and use such "leftovers" to raise pigs and chickens.

Some units and some employees even violate laws and regulations, engaging in criminal activities such as buying or selling more grain than they are entitled to. Within six months, units under the Hengyang Railway Branch Bureau in Hunan Province falsely reported a population of about 10,200 people, buying more than 260,000 catties of grain. Some employees bought more grain and then sold it at high prices, or exchanged grain for things. Shen Jinkui, a railway worker in Hengyang, once sold 15 catties of rice to a landlord at a high price. Wu, the deputy stationmaster of Leiyang Station, used rice to exchange green beans and tea oil with farmers. These units should quickly check and correct this phenomenon, and those who are serious and repeatedly fail to mend their ways should be given appropriate punishment.

Some units have not corrected the phenomenon of food waste even after being criticized. The Guangzhou Paper Mill had a serious waste of food in 1954. At that time, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government issued a circular of criticism, but the factory's waste of food has not changed. In January of this year, they continued to sell leftover food and use leftover food to feed pigs. On February 5, the leftover food wasted in one meal was enough to feed more than 50 people for one meal. For units that have not corrected their mistakes after being criticized, the relevant leaders should take further effective measures to resolutely stop the phenomenon of food waste.

Some readers have introduced some ways to save food. For example, the mess hall of the Hubei Provincial No. 3 Girls' Middle School usually cooks rice according to the actual number of people eating. On Saturdays and Sundays, they re-count the number of people eating at school, which avoids the phenomenon of a large amount of leftover food or not enough to eat. Reader Zhang Jun suggested that cafeterias that sell portioned meals should improve the method of supplying fixed quantities of rice to avoid situations where some people do not have enough to eat and some people cannot finish eating. Reader Cai Dejing suggested that feed for livestock should be cooked before feeding. Livestock can easily digest cooked feed, which can save food.

Many readers believe that units and individuals who waste food must be severely criticized and the masses should be mobilized to supervise them. This is an effective way to correct food waste. The Hubei Provincial No. 3 Girls' Middle School has adopted the method of criticizing the phenomenon of wasting food on the blackboard newspaper, which has achieved good results. Although these methods are relatively fragmented, they are practical and feasible, and can be tried for reference in various places.

    纠正浪费粮食行为，想出节约粮食办法
    董述
    本报读者和驻长沙、武汉、广州、重庆等地的记者，继续揭发了一些机关、企业和学校浪费粮食的现象，并提出了一些节约粮食的办法。
    从这些揭发的材料来看，各地浪费粮食的现象是很严重的。广州市人民检察院和广州市粮食局今年二月间曾在交通部广州市区港务局进行了一次检查，发现港务局从一九五四年十一月到今年二月十二日将近三个半月的时间内，浪费了一万一千六百三十斤冷饭和九千二百二十四斤饭焦。他们养着五十多口猪和成百只鸡鸭，还有剩饭出卖。重庆中国毛纺织厂九百九十六人吃饭，平均每天约有一百五十斤稀饭、四十二斤锅巴和近二十个馒头倒入泔水喂猪。这个厂一九五四年夏天还有过用吃不完的包子喂猪的事情。武汉市协和医院每天浪费的粮食够五十个人吃。
    造成这些大批剩饭的原因，主要是由于伙食管理不严，吃得少，煮得多，有的食堂工作人员甚至错误地认为：“宁可吃不完，不要煮少了。”不合理的制度也是造成大批浪费粮食的原因，四川省北碚天府煤矿伙食团把出卖泔水的钱当做厨工的额外收入，每个饭堂每月可卖得十二元到二十一元，有些厨工为了扩大这种额外收入，就不惜把清洁能吃的饭菜也倒入泔水里。有少数职工和学生不珍惜粮食，任意蹧踏粮食，也是造成浪费的一个原因。吃馒头剥皮、咬几口就扔掉的现象不是个别的。湖北省武汉市建筑工程学校有的学生一碗饭吃了一半就随手倒在沟里。武汉市立第四砖瓦厂附近的居民，每逢该厂饭后就到他们的洗碗水里去捞米饭，每次可捞出五、六斤。四川省重庆市第二十七初级中学有个别学生把剩饭抛到河里喂鱼，作为娱乐。黑龙江省舒兰县第二初级中学有些学生不喜欢吃粗粮，每逢吃粗米饭时，就往地上桌上撒。这个学校约有三百人吃饭，每年浪费的粮食就有八千一百斤。
    这些浪费粮食的现象已引起各单位附近农民的不满，例如重庆市南泉龙井湾的农民对二十七中学校长说：你们再浪费粮食，我们下半年就不卖余粮了。农民对他们的这种指责是完全应该的，这些单位的负责人要切实听取农民的意见，迅速纠正这种浪费现象。
    有些单位的领导人员和食堂工作人员认为“每天浪费十斤、八斤的算不了什么”，“剩饭是发展副业（指养猪养鸡）的有利条件”。这些认识都是错误的。每天浪费的虽少，积累起来就很多了。而且，就是少量的浪费，也是很不应该的，利用残菜、剩饭养猪养鸡是可以的，但是有意地剩饭，或是由于计划不周而增加剩饭，用这样的“剩饭”来养猪养鸡则是不可以的。
    有的单位有些职工甚至违法乱纪，进行多买或出卖粮食等犯罪活动。湖南省衡阳铁路分局所属单位在六个月内虚报的人口约有一万零二百多人，六个月多买二十六万多斤粮食。有的职工多买了粮食，再用高价卖出，或用粮食换东西。衡阳铁路工人沈金魁曾以高价卖了十五斤米给一个地主。耒阳车站吴副站长的爱人曾用大米向农民换绿豆、换茶油。这些单位应迅速检查纠正这种现象，对于情节重大屡教不改者，应该给以适当的处分。
    有的单位的浪费粮食现象受到批评还不纠正。广州造纸厂一九五四年浪费粮食的现象很严重，当时广州市人民政府曾经通报批评，可是这个厂的浪费粮食情况并没有改变，今年一月份他们还继续出卖剩饭和用剩饭喂猪，二月五日一顿饭所浪费的残剩饭就足够五十多个人吃一顿。对这种经过批评还不改正的单位，有关领导方面应进一步采取有效措施，坚决制止浪费粮食现象。
    有些读者介绍了一些节约粮食的办法。如湖北省立第三女子中学伙食团，平时按照实际吃饭人数煮饭，逢星期六和星期日就重新统计在校吃饭的人数，这样就避免了大量剩饭或不够吃的现象。读者张俊建议卖份饭的食堂应改进定量供饭的办法，避免有人不够吃、有人吃不完的情况。读者蔡得井建议喂牲口的饲料应煮熟了再喂，牲口吃熟料容易消化，可以起到节约粮食的作用。
    许多读者认为：对浪费粮食的单位和个人，必须进行严厉的批评，并发动群众监督。这是纠正浪费粮食的有效办法。湖北省第三女中采用在黑板报上批评浪费饭菜的现象，就收到很好的效果。这些办法虽然比较零碎，但都是切实可行的，各地可以参照试用。
