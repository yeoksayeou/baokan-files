    Local industries include all local state-owned industries, cooperative-run industries, local joint state-private industries, private industries, and handicrafts. This is an important component of our national economy. In 1954, the total output value of local industries (excluding handicrafts) accounted for approximately 57% of the total national industrial output value, with means of production accounting for approximately 40% of the total national means of production, and consumer goods accounting for over 70% of the total national consumer goods. This is a force in our economy that cannot be ignored. Therefore, in our planned economic construction, we must pay attention to local industries and gradually develop them in a planned way.

    The important position of local industries in the national Five-Year Plan cannot be ignored. The resolution of the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1927 pointed out: "When formulating the Five-Year Plan, attention must be paid to the development of local small-scale industries and handicrafts, because these industries are currently absolutely necessary assistants to the state's large-scale industries, and they can help eliminate commodity shortages and reduce unemployment." The principles of this instruction also have positive guiding significance for our country. Party committees at all levels and people's governments at all levels must, under the guidance of the state's unified plan, continuously explore the potential of local industries so that our economy can achieve universal prosperity.

    In recent years, all regions have been active in developing local industries, and as a result, local industries have developed rapidly. The estimated total output value completed in 1954 increased by 32% compared to 1953, and the range of product varieties gradually expanded, and the quality also improved. However, due to the lack of clarity in the direction of local industries in the past, there is also considerable blindness in the development of local industries. This is prominently manifested in the fact that, on the one hand, there are very few industries and products that serve agriculture, and the vast rural market has not been actively developed. For example, the total value of local industries currently producing agricultural means of production accounts for only about 4% of the total output value of all local industries; most of these enterprises are concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, and the total output value of local (county) industries close to rural areas accounted for only about 3% of the total national industrial output value in 1953. This situation is obviously unreasonable. However, on the other hand, in cities, the construction and production of some local industries are often duplicated, resulting in contradictions between new and old enterprises, between backward and advanced enterprises, and between enterprises in small and medium-sized cities and enterprises in large cities in terms of supply, production, and sales, thus wasting a large amount of the state's material, financial, and human resources. This situation must also be overcome.

    The blindness in the development of local industries has a certain relationship with the historical situation that most of the original local industries in our country were concentrated in large and medium-sized cities and have long been oriented towards cities, but this is not the main reason. The real reason for the blindness is that some comrades have an unclear understanding of the principle that local industries must be actively developed under the principle of national balance. They one-sidedly implement the principle of "taking materials locally, producing locally, and selling locally," and are further stimulated by some blindly processed orders. Therefore, when investing in capital construction, they only consider the needs of the local area, regardless of the national balance; when organizing production, they only pay attention to products with higher profits, and do not combine them with the needs of urban and rural people's lives and national construction; when purchasing raw materials and promoting products, they also adopted the bad method of mutual blockade between regions. As a result, in some areas, advanced industrial products from other places cannot enter, while low-quality local products flood the market. In some industries, one region suffers from a lack of raw materials, while another region cannot use up its raw materials. This situation has brought serious damage to the country's economic life.

    To overcome and prevent the blind development of local industries, it is necessary to strengthen the concept of the whole country and the overall situation. The concept of the whole country and the overall situation means, first of all, to obey the concept of key construction, especially the construction of heavy industry. Because heavy industry is the industry that produces the means of production, only by prioritizing the development of heavy industry can all sectors of the national economy prosper universally on the basis of modern technology. As for light industry, it should mainly rely on tapping the potential of existing enterprises. Construction projects that are not necessary should be resolutely cancelled; those that can be postponed should also be resolutely not invested in, in order to concentrate efforts on key construction. If it is found in the future that light industry cannot keep up with needs, it will be relatively easy to temporarily increase some construction.

    Secondly, it is necessary to make full use of the capacity of the equipment in the old industrial bases. The utilization rate of the existing local industrial equipment in the old industrial bases is generally not high. According to a survey of the equipment utilization rate of 75 products in Shanghai, only 11 of them reached 80% or more, 30 were between 40% and 80%, 25 were between 20% and 40%, and 9 were below 20%. The situation in Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Shandong is roughly the same as in Shanghai. This shows that if we make full use of this equipment, we can save a lot of funds and manpower and material resources to accelerate the development of heavy industry. Some comrades are unwilling to face up to this important issue. They say: "We have too few industries here, let us rapidly develop local industries in order to achieve regional economic balance!" As everyone knows, the imbalance of regional economies in our country is caused by the long-term economic backwardness of the past, and it cannot be changed all at once. And the real regional economic balance must also be based on developed heavy industry, especially the machine industry. Without these conditions, even if local industries develop faster, it cannot be called a real regional economic balance. Therefore, putting the development of general areas in opposition to the development of key areas, and attempting to replace old industrial bases with new industrial bases all at once, will only divert national investment, hinder national construction, and will not be of any benefit.

    The national perspective should also include unified arrangements for various economies. Among the existing five types of local industries, private industry and handicrafts still account for a relatively large proportion of the national economy and have a certain technical level. From the current situation, they are a very large social productive force and an important component of local industries. Many daily necessities rely on their supply. From the future situation, they will gradually become socialist enterprises with the progress of the socialist transformation cause. Therefore, when formulating local industrial development plans, it is necessary to implement the principle of overall consideration and unified arrangement for local industries of various economic types. We must prevent the phenomenon of developing this economy and squeezing out that economy, developing this industry and squeezing out another industry from happening.

    Does this mean that it will restrict or hinder local initiative? It will not. Because what we oppose is only blind construction and blind production, only departmentalism and localism. The enthusiasm to develop the local economy from the perspective of the whole country and the overall situation is needed at any time. This kind of local initiative can be brought into play in all aspects. Currently, re-examining the existing local industrial construction plans and production plans from the perspective of the whole country and the overall situation, actively reducing unnecessary investment and duplicate products, and using the funds for key projects that the country needs most, is an expression of local initiative. The existing local industries generally have shortcomings such as low equipment utilization rate, low quality, high costs, and large waste; how to actively adopt technical and organizational measures according to the principle of spending less money and achieving greater results, and strive to improve the management of enterprises, produce high-quality and inexpensive products, and accumulate more funds for the country, can also give full play to local initiative. In addition, local initiative can also be brought into play in investing in agriculture, water conservancy, afforestation, and animal husbandry. The greater the initiative in these areas, the more benefits it will bring to the country, the local area, and the people. There are many other areas where local initiative needs to be brought into play, and legitimate local initiative will not be restricted in any way!

    In order to meet the growing needs of people's lives and production, and in order to support the country's planned industrial construction, local industries, as assistants to state-owned industries, must be developed. We believe that as long as all regions proceed from the perspective of the whole country and the overall situation, strengthen planning, overcome and prevent blindness, and correctly give play to local initiative, local industries will surely develop at a considerable speed.

### 必须有计划地发展地方工业

    必须有计划地发展地方工业
    地方工业包括着所有的地方国营工业、合作社营工业、地方公私合营工业、私营工业和手工业。这是我国国民经济中的一个重要组成部分。一九五四年，地方工业的总产值（手工业除外）占全国工业总产值的百分之五十七左右，其中生产资料约占全国生产资料总产值的百分之四十左右，消费资料约占全国消费资料总产值的百分之七十以上。这是我国经济中不可轻视的一支力量，因此在我国有计划的经济建设中，我们必须重视地方工业，使它们逐步地有计划地发展起来。
    地方工业在国家五年计划中所占的重要地位是不容忽视的。一九二七年联共（布）第十五次代表大会决议中曾经指出：“在拟订五年计划时，必须注意发展地方性的小工业、手工业，因为这些工业在目前乃是国家大工业所完全必需的助手，它能帮助消灭商品不足与减轻失业现象。”这个指示的原则，对于我国也有着积极的指导意义。各地党委和各级人民政府必须在国家统一计划指导下，不断地发掘地方工业的潜在力量，使我国经济达到普遍的高涨。
    近几年来，各地对发展地方工业是积极的，因而地方工业的发展很快。一九五四年预计完成的生产总值比一九五三年增长了百分之三十二，产品品种范围逐渐扩大了，质量也有所提高。但是，由于过去对地方工业的方向不明确，地方工业发展中也存在着相当的盲目性。它突出地表现在一方面为农业需要服务的行业和产品很少，没有积极开辟广大的农村市场。例如现有地方工业生产农业生产资料的总值，只占全部地方工业总产值的百分之四左右；这些企业又多半集中在大中城市，接近农村的（县）地方工业，一九五三年的总产值只占全国工业总产值的百分之三左右。这种情况显然是不合理的。可是，另一方面，在城市中，若干地方工业的建设和生产又往往重复，在供产销方面产生新企业同旧企业的矛盾、落后企业同先进企业的矛盾、中小城市的企业同大城市的企业的矛盾，因而大量地浪费了国家的物力、财力和人力。这种情况同样是必须克服的。
    地方工业发展中的盲目性，跟我国原有的地方工业大都集中在大中城市，而且长期都是面向城市的历史情况有一定的关系，但这不是主要的。盲目性的真正原因，是有些同志对地方工业必须在全国平衡的原则下积极发展的方针认识不明确，片面地贯彻“就地取材、就地生产、就地销售”的原则，再加以受到某些盲目加工订货的刺激，所以在投资基本建设的时候，只顾本地的需要，而不管全国的平衡；在组织生产的时候，只注意利润较大的产品，而不与城乡人民的生活及国家建设需要相结合；在采购原料和推销产品的时候，还采取了地区间互相封锁的恶劣办法。结果，在某些地区，一些先进的外地工业产品进不去，而质量低劣的本地产品则充斥市场。有的行业，在这一地区苦于没有原材料，而在另一地区则原材料又用不完。这种情况，给国家的经济生活带来了严重的损害。
    克服和防止地方工业的盲目发展，必须加强全国和全局的观点。所谓全国和全局的观点，首先就是要服从重点建设特别是重工业建设的观点。因为重工业是生产生产资料的工业，只有优先发展了重工业，才可以使国民经济的一切部门在现代技术基础上普遍繁荣。至于轻工业，则主要应该依靠发挥现有企业的潜力，凡不必兴建的就应坚决取消建设项目；凡可以缓建的，也应坚决暂不投资，以便集中力量进行重点建设。如果将来一旦发现轻工业赶不上需要，临时增加一些建设也是比较容易的事。
    其次就必须充分利用旧有工业基地设备的能力。旧有工业基地的现有地方工业设备的利用率一般是不高的。根据上海市七十五种产品设备利用率的调查，达百分之八十以上的只有十一种，百分之四十到八十的三十种，百分之二十到四十的二十五种，百分之二十以下的九种。天津市、江苏省、山东省的情况跟上海的大致相同。这说明，我们要是充分利用这些设备，就能够省出许多资金和人力、物力来加速发展重工业。有些同志不愿意正视这个重要的问题。他们说：“我们这里的工业太少了，让我们迅速发展地方工业，以便达到地区经济平衡吧！”殊不知我国地区经济不平衡是过去长期经济落后的历史所造成的，不是一下子就能改变的。而真正的地区经济平衡，也必须建立在发达的重工业，特别是机器工业的基础上。没有这些条件，即使地方工业发展的再快，也谈不上真正的地区经济平衡。因此把一般地区的发展跟重点地区的发展对立起来，企图一下子以新的工业基地代替旧有的工业基地，这只会分散国家投资，妨害国家建设，没有任何好处。
    全国观点，还应该包括对各种经济的统一安排。在现有的五种经济类型的地方工业中，私营工业和手工业在国民经济中的比重还相当大，并且又具有一定的技术水平。从现在的情况来看，它们是一个很大的社会生产力量，是地方工业的重要组成部分，许多日用品都靠它们供应。从将来的情况来看，它们都将随着社会主义改造事业的进展而逐步变成社会主义性质的企业。因此在制定地方工业发展的计划时，必须对各种经济类型的地方工业，贯彻统筹兼顾的方针，加以统一安排。要防止发展了这种经济、挤垮了那种经济，发展了这一行业、挤垮了另一行业的现象发生。
    这样说来，是不是会限制或妨碍地方积极性呢？这是不会的。因为我们反对的只是盲目建设和盲目生产，只是本位主义和地方主义的积极性。真正从全国和全局的观点发展地方经济的积极性，在任何时候都是需要的，这种地方积极性可以从各方面来发挥。当前从全国和全局的观点来重新审查现有地方工业的建设计划和生产计划，积极削减那些不必要的投资和重复的产品，把资金用到国家最需要的重点工程上去，这就是发挥了地方积极性。现有的地方工业，普遍地存在着设备利用率低、质量低、成本高、浪费大等等缺点；怎样根据花钱少、收效大的原则，积极采取技术组织措施，努力改善企业的经营管理，生产物美价廉的产品，为国家多积累一些资金，这也可以充分发挥地方的积极性。此外，地方积极性也可以发挥在投资农业、水利、造林、畜牧等方面。在这些方面发挥的积极性愈大，对国家、对地方、对人民的好处愈多。其它需要发挥地方积极性的还多得很，地方正当的积极性是不会受到什么限制的！
    为了满足人民的生活和生产日益增长的需要，为了支援国家有计划的工业建设，作为国营工业助手的地方工业是必须发展的。我们相信，只要各地都从全国和全局的观点出发，加强计划性，克服和防止盲目性，正确地发挥地方积极性，地方工业一定会以相当快的速度发展起来的。
