Tianjin Successfully Trials Production of Submarine Cable

    The Tianjin Local State-Owned Cable Factory successfully produced its first batch of new products – submarine cables – on March 2nd. This type of submarine cable can be submerged in seawater, transmitting electricity from land to dredgers in harbors, serving as power for the ships.

    After receiving the order for this batch of submarine cables from the Ministry of Communications' Shipping Administration Bureau in February, the factory began trial production. Technicians and workers overcame many difficulties in the production process. Technicians from the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry and the Local State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 2 also actively assisted the factory in researching the rubber formula for submarine cables, finally achieving successful trial production on February 28th.

    天津试制海用电缆成功
    天津地方国营电缆厂在三月二日生产出第一批新产品——海用电缆。这种海用电缆能够浸在海水中，将电流从陆地输送到港湾内挖泥船上，作为船上的动力。
    这个厂于二月份接受了交通部航运总局这批海用电缆的订货后，就开始了试制工作。技术人员和工人在生产中克服了很多困难；天津市重工业局和地方国营橡胶二厂的技术人员也积极协助该厂研究海用电缆橡胶的配方，终于在二月二十八日试制成功。
