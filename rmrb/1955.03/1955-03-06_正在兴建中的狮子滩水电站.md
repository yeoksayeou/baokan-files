    Lion Beach Hydropower Station Under Construction
    Nie Lei
    The Lion Beach Hydropower Station on the Longxi River in Sichuan is under intense construction. From Changshou, Sichuan, to the construction site, the highway stretches for sixty to seventy li, filled with working crowds. To ensure the supply of various machines and materials for the expanding Lion Beach construction site on the Longxi River, road construction workers are widening the highway by one-third. At the dam site, cranes span the center of the riverbed, extending their arms more than ten zhang long, rotating in the air, while two or three columns of locomotives run back and forth on the light railway tracks. The sound of the pneumatic drills mixes with the roar of the Lion Beach waterfall.
    The Lion Beach Hydropower Station is a rather large project. This hydropower station will construct a dam as long as two li, about fifty meters high, and eight meters wide at the top, cutting off the Longxi River and creating a reservoir of more than sixty square li; it will also dig a water diversion tunnel about three li long from the mountains to draw water from the reservoir to power the turbines in the main powerhouse. In addition, an overflow channel must be dug to discharge excess water from the reservoir during floods, preventing floods from overflowing the dam.... The stones and soil to be excavated and filled in these projects are about two million cubic meters, enough to build a levee more than two thousand kilometers long and one meter high and thick. The construction of a hydropower station of this type generally takes about five years, but the state, in order to meet the needs of Chongqing's industrial development, is determined to complete it in two or three years, which makes the project even more arduous. During the first dry season of this year, six projects directly threatened by floods must be completed. Before the floods arrive in April this year, the foundation of the dam must be properly handled and the dam built to a considerable height. For the construction of the dam, workers must work on the dry riverbed and must complete the cofferdam and drainage culverts before the end of last year to block the water flow and discharge it from the culvert.... Many workers voluntarily gave up their rest from the National Day last year to the New Year's Day and the Spring Festival this year. They said: "Floods do not take holidays! Our project must be ahead of the floods!"

    After the completion of the Lion Beach Hydropower Station, Chongqing, Changshou, and Beibei will be connected into a powerful power grid. The Lion Beach Hydropower Station will be able to adjust the power consumption of these three regions by using its own unique and cheap power generation conditions. The power generation of this hydropower station is twice that of the Chongqing Power Plant, the largest power plant in the Southwest. After it is put into production, it will promote the development of Chongqing's steel, machinery, chemical and other industries, thereby driving the smooth construction of Chongqing's other industries.
    Low cost is the biggest feature of hydropower stations compared to thermal power plants. Especially in the Southwest, where coal reserves are not large but water resources are abundant, the construction of hydropower stations is even more important. At present, the main coal mines supplying Chongqing are between 100 and 300 kilometers away from Chongqing, which is not suitable for Chongqing to build a giant thermal power plant. The cost of thermal power is higher. The cost of thermal power generation in Chongqing Power Plant is 0.0415 yuan per kilowatt-hour, while the cost of Changshou 505 Hydropower Station in the same period is only 0.0124 yuan per kilowatt-hour; the Lion Beach Hydropower Station is larger in scale, and its cost per kilowatt-hour will be 0.0128 yuan, which is only a quarter of the power cost of Chongqing Thermal Power Station. After this hydropower station generates electricity, it can save Chongqing about 100,000 tons of fuel coal every year.
    After the completion of the Lion Beach Hydropower Station, there will be a reservoir with a surrounding area of more than sixty li. In the future, the water accumulated in the reservoir will be used to drive the turbines to generate electricity. At the same time, the natural flow of the Longxi River can be adjusted through the reservoir, so that the machine equipment of the downstream hydropower station can give full play to its role. At present, a hydropower station downstream of the Longxi River cannot generate enough electricity for about 44% of the time due to insufficient flow during the dry season. In the dry year, the reliable power generation is less than half of the machine equipment capacity, which affects Changshou's industrial production and development. Due to the completion of the reservoir, the existing hydropower station downstream can be expanded into a larger hydropower station.
    In the future, the Lion Beach Hydropower Station reservoir will be a wide inland lake with many large and small islands. Trees, flowers and plants will also be planted around the inland lake, and the quiet environment will become a resort for recuperation and summer vacation in Sichuan. Various kinds of fish will also be raised in the lake to supply the people of Chongqing, who lack fresh fish, for consumption. It is estimated that the fish produced in the reservoir every year can offset the annual income of the farmland occupied by the reservoir in the Longxi River basin.
    The Lion Beach Hydropower Station, which is under construction, will be able to generate some electricity next year, and the entire project is expected to be completed in 1957. This will be an automated hydropower station. In the future, only one-tenth of the management personnel and a few workers of a general thermal power plant will be required to operate all the complex equipment of sluice gates, spillways, and drainage culverts to generate powerful electricity.

    正在兴建中的狮子滩水电站
    聂雷
    四川龙溪河狮子滩水电站正在紧张地建设中。从四川长寿到工地，连绵六、七十里的公路上都是劳动着的人群。为了保证日渐扩大的龙溪河狮子滩工地各种机器材料的供应，筑路工人正在把这条公路增宽三分之一倍。在工地拦河坝上，起重机横跨在河床的中央，伸出十余丈长的手臂，在空中旋转着，两三列机关车在工地的轻便铁道上来往奔驰。风钻的突突声和狮子滩瀑布的吼声混和在一起。
    狮子滩水电站的工程是相当庞大的。这个水电站要在这里筑成一道长达二华里、高约五十公尺、顶宽八公尺的拦河坝，把龙溪河水截断，造成一个六十多平方华里的水库；还要从山里开一条长约三华里的引水隧道，以便把水库里的水引去冲动主厂房里的水轮机。另外还要挖一条溢洪道，好在洪水时把水库里多余的水从此排泄出去，免得洪水翻越拦河坝……。这些工程要挖填的石头和泥土，约在两百万立方公尺左右，可筑成一道两千多公里高厚各一公尺的堤。兴建像这样类型的水电站，一般的需要五年左右的时间，但国家为了赶上重庆工业发展的需要，决心在二、三年内来完成，这就使得这个工程更加艰巨了。今年第一个枯水季节必须完成直接受洪水威胁的六项工程，今年四月洪水来到以前要处理好拦河坝的基础，并把坝筑到相当的高度；为了拦河坝的施工，工人要在没有水的河床上进行工作，又必须在去年底以前修好围堰和排水涵洞，截住水流，把它从涵洞排出去……。许多工人从去年国庆到今年的元旦和春节，都自动放弃了休息，他们说：“洪水并不放假啊！我们的工程一定要走在洪水的前头！”

    狮子滩水电站建成后，重庆、长寿、北碚就要联成一个强大的电力网。狮子滩水电站就能利用本身发电特有便宜的条件，来调节这三个地区的用电。这个水电站的发电量，比目前西南最大的电厂重庆电力厂还要大一倍。它投入生产后，将促进重庆区钢铁、机械、化学等工业的发展，从而带动重庆的其他工业顺利地进行建设。
    成本低是水电站优于火电站的最大特点。特别像西南这个煤的蕴藏量不大而却有丰富水力资源的地区，兴建水电站就更具有重要的意义。目前供给重庆用煤的几个主要煤矿，距重庆都在一至三百公里之间，这就不适宜于重庆建立巨型的火电站。火电的成本较高，重庆电力厂火力发电成本每度为○·○四一五元，而同时期长寿五○五水电站每度只为○·○一二四元；狮子滩水电站的规模较大，它的成本每度将为○·○一二八元，只为重庆火电站电力成本的四分之一。这个水电站发电后，能为重庆每年节约十万吨左右的燃煤。
    狮子滩水电站建成后，将有一个周围六十多华里的水库，将来就利用水库里积蓄的水去推动水轮机，发出电来。同时龙溪河的天然流量经过水库的调节，可以使下游的水电站的机器设备能充分发挥作用。目前龙溪河下游的一个水电站，每逢枯水时因流量不够，有百分之四十四左右的时间发不足电，遇枯水年，可靠发电量还不及机器设备容量的一半，这使长寿的工业生产和发展受到影响。由于水库的建成，并可以把下游现有的水电站扩大成为较大型的水电站。
    将来狮子滩水电站水库，是一个宽广的内湖，里面有许多大大小小的岛屿。内湖的周围还要广植树木花草，环境清静，将成为四川疗养和避暑的胜地。湖内还要养殖各种鱼类，供给缺少鲜鱼的重庆市人民食用。预计以后水库里每年出产的鱼类，就可以抵得上龙溪河流域被水库占用的农田每年的收入。
    正在兴建中的狮子滩水电站，明年就可以发出一部分电来了，预计全部工程在一九五七年完成。这将是一个自动化的水电站，将来只需要一般火电站十分之一的管理人员和少数工人，就可以操纵所有的水闸、溢洪道、排水涵洞的复杂设备，发出强大的电力来。
