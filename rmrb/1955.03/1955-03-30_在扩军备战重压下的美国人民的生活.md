    The Life of the American People Under the Heavy Burden of Military Expansion and War Preparations
    Large Numbers of Workers Unemployed in Many Industrial Sectors
    Large-scale worker unemployment has become a chronic problem in several American industrial sectors, and in these industrial concentration areas, unemployment has become a serious issue.
    An article published in the March 18th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "In some places in the United States, unemployment has become an old problem. In certain industrial sectors, there are fewer jobs year by year."
    The unemployment problem in the coal mining industry is particularly prominent. This sector has been in a severe depression for several years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, comparing the current employment figures with the highest employment year in the last fifteen years, hard coal mining has decreased by two-thirds, and soft coal mining has decreased by 57 percent.
    The number of employees in railway enterprises has also declined significantly in recent years. Compared with 1945, the current number has decreased by 392,700 people, or 27.6 percent. Currently, 166,000 railway workers are living on unemployment benefits.
    Employment in the textile industry is steadily declining. Since 1942, employment has decreased by 287,300 people, or over 20 percent. Lawrence, Massachusetts, one of the textile industry centers, is the most severely affected. For most of 1954, more than 20 percent of the labor force in this city was unemployed, so that it was regarded by American government officials as the city with the most serious labor surplus in the United States.
    Industrial sectors with serious unemployment also include agricultural machinery manufacturing, lead and zinc mining, etc.
    Millions of Small Farmers Displaced by Agricultural Capitalists
    A large number of American small farmers are going bankrupt and are being forced to leave their farms.
    According to Associated Press reporter Martin, millions of small farmers in the United States have been squeezed out by agricultural capitalists and hit by the agricultural crisis. Many have gone bankrupt and left their farms. In the past two decades, the agricultural population of the United States has decreased by one-third, and the number of farms has also decreased by one-third. During the period since 1953, 1,389,000 farms have disappeared. Martin estimates that in the next few years, the process of small farms being annexed by large agricultural capitalists will intensify further, and another one-third of the farms will be annexed, and the land will be further concentrated in the hands of a few large agricultural capitalists.
    In the past two years, in order to alleviate the serious crisis of agricultural product surplus, the U.S. government has adopted a method of rigidly restricting cultivated land area, which has further helped large agricultural capitalists and hit small farmers. According to an estimate by a subcommittee of the U.S. Congress, due to the government's order to reduce the cotton planting area this year, it "will force 55,000 tenant farmers to leave their farms."
    Millions of School Children Have No Place to Attend Class
    According to the American "Economic Review," there is a serious lack of school buildings in the United States.
      The "Economic Review" said that, according to the U.S. Office of Education, in September 1954, there was a shortage of 370,000 classrooms in public schools in the United States. In the winter of 1953-54, 840,000 students had to attend classes in temporary housing, 300,000 students attended classes in dilapidated buildings in schools, and more than 400,000 students attended classes in rented garages, churches, etc. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

### 在扩军备战重压下的美国人民的生活

    在扩军备战重压下的美国人民的生活
    许多工业部门中存在着大量工人失业问题
    大量工人失业在美国若干工业部门中已经成为一种经常性的痼疾，在这些工业集中的地区，失业问题已经成为严重的问题。
    三月十八日的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊载的一篇文章写道：“在美国有些地方，失业变成老问题了。在某些工业部门中，职业一年比一年少。”
    采煤业的失业问题十分突出。这个部门近几年来一直处于严重萧条之中。根据美国劳工统计局的统计，把目前的就业人数同最近十五年中最高一年的就业人数相比较，硬煤采掘部门减少了三分之二，软煤采掘部门也减少了百分之五十七。
    铁路企业中的就业人数近几年来同样大大下降。同一九四五年相比较，目前减少了三十九万二千七百人，即百分之二十七点六。现在有十六万六千个铁路工人靠领取失业救济金过活。
    纺织工业的就业人数在持续下降。自从一九四二年以来，就业人数减少了二十八万七千三百人，即百分之二十强。纺织业中心之一马萨诸塞州的劳伦斯城，这方面的情形最为严重。在一九五四年的大部分时间内，这个城市有百分之二十以上的劳动力失业，以致被美国政府官员认为是美国的劳动力过剩最严重的城市。
    失业严重的工业部门还有农业机器制造业、铅锌采矿业等。
    千百万小农在农业资本家排挤下流离失所
    美国大批小农破产，被迫离开自己的农庄。
    据美联社记者马丁报道，美国千百万小农遭到农业资本家的排挤和农业危机的打击，许多人破了产离开农庄，二十年来，美国农业人口减少了三分之一，农庄的数目也减少了三分之一。从一九五三年以来这段时期内，就少去了一百三十八万九千个农庄，据马丁估计，在今后几年内，小农庄被大农业资本家并吞的过程将更为加剧，将再有三分之一的农庄被并吞掉，土地要进一步集中到少数大农业资本家的手中。
    美国政府近两年来为了缓和严重的农产品过剩的危机，采取硬性限制耕地面积的办法，进一步帮助了大农业资本家，而打击了小农。据美国国会的一个小组委员会估计，由于今年政府命令缩减棉田的种植额，“将迫使五万五千个佃农离开农庄”。
    成百万学童无处上课
    据美国“经济评论”报道，在美国的学校中严重地缺乏校舍。
      “经济评论”说，据美国教育局估计，在一九五四年九月，在美国的公立学校中共短少三十七万间教室。在一九五三—五四年的冬季，不得不有八十四万学童在临时性的房舍里上课，三十万学童在学校里的破旧不堪的房子里上课，四十多万学童在租来的汽车间、教堂等里面上课。（据新华社讯）
