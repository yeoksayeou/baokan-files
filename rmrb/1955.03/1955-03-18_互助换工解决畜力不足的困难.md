Mutual Aid and Labor Exchange Solve the Difficulty of Insufficient Animal Power

    In some areas of Henan Province, the problem of insufficient animal power has been solved by developing mutual borrowing and exchange, and assistance from relatives and friends. In Lushan County, the first cooperative in Hetang Township had more livestock, while the third cooperative had less. The first cooperative sent four teams of livestock, and the third cooperative sent twenty-four laborers to help each other and solve the difficulties. In Runan County, the Guangming Cooperative in the eighth district also solved the problem of insufficient labor and animal power by transporting manure with manpower and plowing the land with livestock according to plan. In Xixia County, thirty-seven agricultural production cooperatives used methods such as exchanging cattle power for grass feed and exchanging cattle power for labor, which not only solved the problem of insufficient animal power in the cooperatives, but also helped thirty-eight households in difficulty to plow the spring fields.

    互助换工解决畜力不足的困难
    河南省部分地区用开展互借互换，亲友相助的办法，解决畜力的不足。鲁山县贺堂乡第一社牲畜多，第三社牲畜少，第一社便抽出四犋牲畜，第三社抽出二十四个劳力，互相帮助解决了困难。汝南县八区光明社按照计划以人力送粪，牲畜犁地等办法也解决了劳力和畜力不足的困难。西峡县三十七个农业生产合作社以牛力换草料和以牛力换人工等办法，不仅解决了合作社畜力不足的困难，并且帮助三十八个困难户犁了春地。       （本报驻开封记者）
