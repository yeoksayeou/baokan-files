Women's Lives Under Two Different Systems
Zhu Lunzhang

The annual International Women's Day has arrived. Since 1910, when March 8th was designated as International Women's Day, the world has undergone tremendous changes in these forty-plus years. Today, in many countries that account for a quarter of the world's land and more than a third of the world's population, millions upon millions of women, together with all the people of these countries, have been liberated and are building a happy new life together with all the people. However, vast numbers of women still groan under the shackles of the capitalist system, suffering from the brutal oppression and exploitation of capitalists and landlords. They are the most oppressed, most discriminated against, most tragically encountered, and most painfully living group in capitalist society. Everyone can clearly see the difference between the status and lives of women in socialist and people's democratic countries and the status and lives of women in capitalist countries.

In socialist camp countries, women, along with all the working people of these countries, have been liberated from feudal and capitalist oppression. The socialist and people's democratic state systems and social systems guarantee women a free, independent, and equal status. The constitutions promulgated in various countries have special provisions to ensure that women enjoy the same rights as men, and women have full opportunities and conditions to participate in various social and political activities. They widely participate in the work of building state power. In the Soviet Union, there are 348 women representatives in the Supreme Soviet. In China, 147 women were elected to the First National People's Congress. In other people's democratic countries, more and more women are participating in government organs at all levels, holding leadership or important positions.

In the economic and cultural fields, women have also achieved equal status with men. Many of them hold leadership positions in national economic departments, master advanced culture, and become experts in industry, transportation, agriculture, and many scientific departments, or assume important work in cultural departments. They are already a huge force in the economic and cultural construction of the country. In the Soviet Union, nearly three million women are engaged in science, education, and cultural institutions, and more than one million women gloriously undertake the task of educating the next generation. In the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, there are 71 female scientific workers. In Poland, dozens of professions now absorb women to participate in work, and nearly 20,000 cadres have been promoted in industry to serve as factory directors, managers, chief engineers, foremen, and work team leaders. In Czechoslovakia, women account for 12 percent of all employees in railway transportation. In China, a group of female pilots, locomotive, river steamer, and tractor drivers have emerged. Many young women have joined arduous field work. In many positions that previously excluded women, women in New China are proudly and increasingly taking on their tasks.

Women in the new society, freed from capitalist and feudal shackles, widely enjoy the right to education, and the number of female students in schools is rapidly increasing. In China, the number of female students in universities and colleges in 1954 increased two and a half times compared with 1949.

Women in socialist camp countries enthusiastically participate in the construction of the new society, bravely devote themselves to the struggle to defend the motherland, and receive high honors and respect from the state and society. For example, in the Soviet Union, 2,373 women have been awarded the glorious titles of Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Socialist Labor for their outstanding contributions to the motherland and the people. In the war against American aggression, Korean women demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, and more than 18,000 women in the rear alone were awarded the Order and Medal of the Republic.

The socialist camp countries pay special attention to the care and protection of women and children. The state has established many maternity hospitals and nurseries, and also allocates a large amount of funds every year to protect mothers and infants. For example, in the Soviet Union last year, subsidies for mothers with many children, single mothers, and infant care amounted to more than 7 billion rubles. In Bulgaria, after the establishment of the people's regime, maternity hospitals have increased 19 times, and the maternal mortality rate has decreased by 68 percent. In Czechoslovakia, every expectant mother receives regular medical care from the first day of pregnancy, and women's counseling stations increased eightfold from 1945 to 1954. Romania has opened more than 5,000 kindergartens, allowing mothers to participate better in social labor and children to receive appropriate care. In the countries of this camp, the law guarantees working women paid maternity leave.

It must be pointed out that in these countries, the status of women and the care they receive are constantly increasing with the economic development of these countries.

In stark contrast, in the capitalist world, women are still trampled at the bottom of society. Women in more than a dozen countries are deprived of the right to vote, and women in more than one hundred colonial dependencies and trust territories are deprived of all rights. In those countries where the law stipulates that women have the right to vote, there are also many restrictions on women's participation in elections, and in fact, a large number of women still do not have the right to vote. In the United States, which is touted as a "bastion of democracy," there are more than 50 restrictions on women's right to vote in the legislation of some states. Among the more than 500 members of the US Senate and House of Representatives, there are only a dozen women. It is enough to point out the fact that the total number of women in the parliaments of all capitalist countries is less than the number of women representatives in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Women in capitalist countries suffer extremely unequal treatment economically, and unemployment, poverty, hunger, and disease follow their families closely. There, women are regarded as cheap labor, one of the sources for capitalists to obtain super profits. In the United States, according to statistics from the United Electrical Workers Union, the wages of white female workers in the United States are only slightly less than 40 percent of the wages of white male workers, while the wages of black female workers are only slightly less than 14 percent of the wages of white male workers. In countries like West Germany, although the constitution stipulates equal pay for equal work, the average weekly wage of female workers is actually less than three-fifths of the average wage of male workers (excluding miners). In some capitalist countries, laws expressly stipulate that men and women cannot receive equal pay for equal work. Female workers not only have extremely low wages, but are also most likely to be laid off. For example, in the Netherlands, women are dismissed once they get married, and Belgium does not treat unemployed women with husbands as unemployed and does not provide unemployment benefits. In rural Iran, peasant women are forced to serve landlords without receiving any remuneration.

Childbirth is a disaster for women in the capitalist world. They do not receive basic medical care. For the sake of their jobs and lives, they have to go to work with weak bodies during their confinement period, let alone take care of their babies.

Women in capitalist countries also have pitifully few opportunities for education. For example, in the United Kingdom, female students account for only slightly more than 5 percent of universities and colleges, and female students in Japanese universities account for only 9 percent. For the vast majority of women in colonial dependencies, the right to education is only a "luxury."

Under the capitalist system, even more tragic is that women are bought and sold and controlled like commodities and playthings. They are deprived of independent personalities. The so-called "respect" for women in that Western "civilized" society is only an irony of their actual subordinate and ravaged status. For example, in Canada, it is even stipulated in the law that men can beat their wives at will, as long as the stick used is no thicker than a thumb.

As for the vast number of women in colonies and dependencies, they suffer from the double oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and their lives are even darker. They are subjected to extremely cruel exploitation, arbitrary ravage, and receive no protection whatsoever.

The free and happy lives of women in the socialist camp countries clearly illustrate to women in all capitalist countries that only by breaking away from the oppression and shackles of the capitalist system can women become masters of the country, equal members of society, and controllers of their own destiny; only the victory of socialism can guarantee the complete liberation of women, making it possible for them to participate in all activities of social life and give full play to their abilities and talents. This situation cannot but encourage millions of working women in capitalist countries to fight for their rights and happiness. The fact that women in capitalist countries are increasingly participating in the struggle for peace, democracy, and women's rights shows that they are no longer willing to live as they did in the past. Women throughout the capitalist world are celebrating their great holiday in an intensified struggle for peace and to stop the threat of new wars. They must strengthen unity to strive for the early arrival of a free and happy day.

    两种不同制度下的妇女生活
    朱伦璋
    一年一度的国际妇女节到来了。自一九一○年定每年的三月八日为国际妇女节以来，在这四十多年中，世界已经发生了巨大的变化。今天，占世界四分之一的土地和三分之一以上的人口的许多国家千千万万妇女，已经同这些国家的全体人民一道获得了解放，并正在和全体人民一道建设着幸福的新生活。但是，仍有广大的妇女今天还呻吟在资本主义制度的枷锁下面，遭受着资本家和地主阶级的残酷压迫和剥削。她们是资本主义社会中最受压迫、最受歧视、遭遇最悲惨，生活最痛苦的一群。每一个人都可以清楚地看到：社会主义和人民民主国家的妇女的地位和生活同资本主义国家妇女的地位和生活相比，有着怎样的区别。
    在社会主义阵营各国，妇女已经和这些国家的所有劳动人民一起从封建和资本主义压迫下获得解放。社会主义和人民民主的国家制度和社会制度保障妇女得到自由、独立、平等的地位。在各国颁布的宪法中都有特别关于保障妇女享有与男子一样权利的规定，妇女们都获得充分的机会和条件参加各种社会和政治活动。她们广泛地参加了政权建设工作。在苏联，最高苏维埃中就有三百四十八名妇女代表，在我国，有一百四十七名妇女选进了第一届全国人民代表大会，在其他人民民主国家中，也有愈来愈多的妇女参加各级政府机构担任领导或重要的职务。
    在经济和文化领域里面，妇女也已获得了与男子平等的地位，她们许多人在国民经济部门中担任领导职务，掌握先进的文化，成为工业、运输业、农业、科学许多部门的专家，或者在文化部门担负了重要的工作。她们已经是国家的经济和文化建设中的一支巨大力量。在苏联，有将近三百万妇女从事科学、教育和文化机关工作，有一百多万妇女光荣地担当着教育下一代的任务。在保加利亚科学院中，就有七十一位女科学工作者。在波兰，几十种职业，现在都吸收妇女参加工作，并在工业中提拔了将近两万名干部，担任厂长，经理，总工程师，工长以及工作队长。在捷克斯洛伐克的铁路运输方面妇女占到全体职工的百分之十二。在我国已出现了一批妇女航空员、机车、江轮和拖拉机的驾驶员，许多女青年参加了艰巨的野外工作，在许多过去一直把妇女排斥在外的岗位上，新中国的妇女正骄傲地愈来愈多地担负起她们的任务。
    摆脱了资本主义和封建束缚的新社会妇女们，广泛地享受教育权利，学校中女生的数目迅速增加。我国高等学校中女生的数目，一九五四年比一九四九年时增加了二倍半。
    社会主义阵营各国妇女热情洋溢地参加新社会的建设，奋不顾身地投进保卫祖国的斗争，得到国家和社会的崇高荣誉和尊敬。例如苏联就有二千三百七十三名妇女由于对祖国和人民的卓越贡献而荣获苏联英雄和社会主义劳动英雄的光荣称号。朝鲜妇女在反抗美国侵略的战争中，发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，仅后方妇女就有一万八千多名荣获共和国勋章和奖章。
    社会主义阵营各国对于妇女和儿童特别加意地关怀和保护。国家设立了许多的产育院，托儿所，并且每年还拨出大量的经费保护母亲和婴儿。如苏联去年一年中给予子女众多的母亲，单身母亲和照顾婴儿的津贴就达七十多亿卢布。在保加利亚，人民政权建立后，产育院已增加了十九倍，产妇的死亡率减少了百分之六十八。在捷克斯洛伐克，每一位未来的母亲，从怀孕的第一天起就得到经常的医疗照顾，妇女辅导站从一九四五年到一九五四年增加为八倍。罗马尼亚开设了五千多个幼儿园，使母亲可以更好地参加社会劳动，儿童得到适当照顾。在这个阵营的各国里，法律保障工作妇女可以有工资照付的产期休假。
    必须指出，在这些国家中，妇女的地位以及她们所受到的关怀，随着这些国家经济的发展，还在不断增长。
    与此成鲜明的对照，在资本主义世界，妇女们还被践踏在社会的底层。有十几个国家的妇女被剥夺了选举权，在一百多个殖民地附属国和托管地区里妇女被剥夺了一切权利。在那些法律规定妇女有选举权的国家，也对妇女参加选举有许多限制，实际上有广大的妇女仍然得不到选举权。被吹嘘为“民主堡垒”的美国，在某些州的立法中，对妇女的选举权就有五十多种的限制。美国参众两院五百多名议员中，妇女只有十几名。只要指出这样一个事实就已足够了：所有资本主义国家议会里的妇女总数还不及苏联最高苏维埃妇女代表的数字。
    资本主义各国的妇女在经济上遭到极不平等的待遇，失业，贫困，饥饿和疾病形影不离地追随着她们的家庭。在那里，妇女被看作是廉价的劳动力，是资本家获取超额利润的泉源之一。在美国，据美国联合电气工人工会的统计，美国白人女工工资只有白人男工工资的百分之四十弱，而黑人女工工资只有白人男工工资的百分之十四弱。像西德，虽然宪法上规定男女同工同酬，但实际上女工一星期平均所得工资不足男工（矿工除外）的平均工资的五分之三。在某些资本主义国家里，法律明文规定男女不能同工同酬。女工们不但工资极其低微，而且还最容易遭到解雇。如荷兰妇女一旦结婚就要遭到解雇，比利时把有丈夫的失业妇女不当作失业，不发给失业补助金。在伊朗农村，农妇被迫给地主服役而根本得不到任何报酬。
    生育对资本主义世界的妇女来说，是一种灾难。他们得不到起码的医疗照顾。为了职业和生活，她们不得不在产期拖着虚弱的身子去上工，更谈不上对婴儿的照顾了。
    资本主义国家妇女受教育的机会也少得可怜。如英国，高等学校中的女生只占百分之五强，日本大学女生只占百分之九。对于大多数殖民地附属国的妇女来说，受教育的权利只是一种“奢望”而已。
    在资本主义制度下，更悲惨的是妇女，像商品和玩物一样地任人买卖和支配，她们被剥夺掉独立的人格，在那西方“文明”社会里对妇女所谓的“尊重”，只是对她们实际所处的附属和被蹂躏的地位的一种讽刺。例如，在加拿大，甚至在法律中规定，男子可以随便打妻子，只要用的棒不比大拇指粗。
    至于广大殖民地和附属国的妇女，她们受到帝国主义和封建主义的双重压迫，生活就更为黑暗。她们受到极其残酷的剥削，任意的蹂躏，得不到丝毫的保护。
    社会主义阵营各国妇女的自由、幸福的生活，向所有资本主义国家的妇女清楚地说明：只有摆脱资本主义制度的压迫和束缚，妇女才能成为国家的主人，成为社会的平等成员，成为自己命运的支配者；只有社会主义的胜利才可以保证妇女完全解放，使她们有可能参加社会生活中一切活动，发挥她们的能力和才智。这种情形不能不鼓舞资本主义国家千百万劳动妇女去为自己的权利和幸福而斗争。资本主义各国妇女愈来愈广泛地参加到争取和平、民主和妇女权利的斗争中来的事实说明，她们再也不愿像过去那样地生活了。整个资本主义世界的妇女在加紧争取和平、制止新战争的威胁的斗争中庆祝自己的伟大节日，她们要加强团结以争取自由幸福的一天早日到来。
