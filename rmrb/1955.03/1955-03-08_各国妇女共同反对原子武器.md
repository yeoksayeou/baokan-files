Women of All Countries Jointly Oppose Atomic Weapons
Du Zhen

The Second World War caused countless mothers and wives in various countries to lose their loved ones. People still vividly remember this tragic disaster. Today, the imperialist war bloc is threatening to launch a new war using atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Women of all countries cannot help but feel deeply disturbed and incredibly angry about this. Therefore, women from all countries are actively participating in the struggle against war and atomic weapons, strongly voicing their demands to stop and crush the heinous attempts of the atomic maniacs.

In 1950, women from all countries, along with people all over the world, signed the Stockholm Appeal, demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. This global mass movement played a significant role in mobilizing people of all countries to unite against atomic weapons and defend world peace. The powerful strength and broad mobilization of peace-loving people made it so that American imperialism dared not use atomic weapons in its war of aggression against Korea and its intervention in Indochina.

In recent months, the war bloc headed by American imperialism has been frightened by the rapid expansion of the people's power. They are making increasingly frequent atomic threats, openly clamoring for and intensifying preparations for atomic warfare. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc decided to authorize its military personnel to use atomic weapons. They also want to grant West German militarists atomic weapons through the Paris Agreements. The United States is frequently conducting atomic weapons tests and threatening the people of the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries with atomic warfare. Britain also threatens the world's people by publicly announcing the manufacture of hydrogen bombs. Therefore, women of all countries, along with the people of all countries, are launching a struggle against atomic weapons with renewed efforts and on a larger scale.

Special mention should be made here of the active and militant spirit shown by Japanese women in the struggle against atomic weapons. Many influential women's groups, such as the Federation of All-Japan Women's Organizations, the Housewives' Federation, the National Regional Women's Organizations Liaison Council, the Japan Women's Suffrage League, and the Japan Women's Peace Association, representing broad sections of Japanese women, have issued statements demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons. They actively participated in the large-scale signature campaign against atomic weapons by the Japanese people. As of January 15, more than 22 million signatures had been collected in Japan, accounting for about a quarter of the Japanese population. Most of these signatures were from women or collected by women. This movement is still developing.

Japanese women have also issued appeals to women all over the world and international women's organizations, saying: "The Japanese people, who have suffered three times from the disasters of atomic and hydrogen weapons, cannot but appeal to every rational person in the world to unite and demand the prohibition of the manufacture, testing and use of weapons like hydrogen bombs." This appeal has been widely distributed in many countries around the world and has gained the support of a large number of women in various countries.

In other Asian countries, such as India and Indonesia, women, along with the people of various countries, have launched a struggle against atomic weapons. Women's congresses in India and Indonesia have passed resolutions calling on women to stand up against atomic weapons and atomic warfare.

In Europe, women who have suffered the cruel ravages of fascist beasts and the frenzied bombing day and night cannot help but worry even more about their own lives and the safety of their children in the face of the grave threat of the resurrection of Hitler's "Wehrmacht." They cannot stand idly by and watch atomic weapons be handed over to Hitler's generals, whose hands are stained with the blood of European women and children. Therefore, women in various European countries closely combine the struggle against atomic weapons with the struggle against arming West Germany and against the "Paris Agreements." The French Women's Union issued an appeal to French women, saying:
"The threat of the atomic bomb makes the struggle against arming West Germany even more urgent." British women launched a nationwide petition against the hydrogen bomb almost at the same time as they launched a movement against arming West Germany. The British Women's Cooperative Association, which has a broad mass base, also called for opposition to arming West Germany and against the hydrogen bomb at its recent congress.

In the United States, although the ruling bloc and its propaganda machine are doing their best to incite war hysteria, many women's groups, especially mothers' groups, are forming. These groups, along with other organizations, bravely raise the issues of defending democratic freedom, defending peace, and especially opposing the danger of atomic warfare. The women's departments of the American Peace Crusade in many parts of the country, as well as many branches of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, have launched a movement demanding a ban on atomic weapons.

In addition, in many countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Near East, women have launched movements against atomic weapons.

The increasingly high tide of the struggle of women of all countries against atomic weapons has united women of various political and religious beliefs and from different social strata under a common goal, and has taken common action, thereby greatly expanding the momentum and strength of the women's peace movement in various countries. Now, in addition to the national member organizations of the international organization of the democratic women's movement—the Women's International Democratic Federation—other international women's organizations and national women's organizations with broad mass bases are calling for opposition to atomic weapons. For example, the branches of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in Switzerland, Ireland, Japan, Canada, the United States, Britain, and Sweden have all declared their opposition to the use of hydrogen bombs. The British Women's Cooperative Organization, Labour Party women, and Swedish women's cooperative organizations, Social Democratic women, and Liberal Party women have all expressed their opposition to atomic weapons. One of Norway's largest bourgeois women's organizations, the "Housewives' Association," decided to launch a campaign against the hydrogen bomb and suggested that sister organizations in other countries take the same action.

Now, women from all countries are actively responding to the call of the World Peace Council and are enthusiastically participating in the massive signature campaign of people of all countries against the use of atomic weapons. The Women's International Democratic Federation calls on women all over the world to unite and fight together in support of the "Appeal to the People of the World" by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and to resolutely oppose the use and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.

Women in China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries were the first to respond to this call. We Chinese women actively responded to and enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. We stand with women from all over the world and resolutely oppose atomic warfare. The Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee issued a statement calling on all Soviet women to actively support the call of the World Peace Council and calling on women all over the world and peace defenders all over the world to join all peace-loving people in all countries in demanding the destruction of all existing atomic weapons in various countries and the immediate cessation of the manufacture of such weapons. Women in Korea, Vietnam, and other people's democratic countries, together with the people of the whole country, warmly welcomed and supported the call of the World Peace Council and launched a nationwide signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.

The struggle of women of all countries against atomic weapons is constantly growing on an unprecedentedly broad scale. If every mother and every woman signs the "Appeal to the People of the World" by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, it will be a massive demonstration of hundreds of millions of women against atomic weapons. At present, in many countries, women are combining this huge signature campaign with the preparations for the World Mothers' Congress to be held in July this year. This congress will be a congress of mothers all over the world against war, defending children, demanding disarmament, and promoting friendship between the peoples of all countries. There is no doubt that women, who make up half of all humanity, are a powerful force against atomic warfare. Their strong struggle against atomic weapons, together with the people of the world, will surely be able to stop the evil plans of the atomic maniacs and achieve the lofty goal of using atomic energy for peace and human progress and prosperity.

Discussion of the Situation Arising from US Activities to Accelerate Ratification of the Paris Accords

Democratic German Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bolz Visits Warsaw
Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. According to TASS Warsaw, the 6th: The newspapers published the official statement of the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Germany, Lothar Bolz, visiting Warsaw. The statement says that Bolz's visit to Poland's capital is due to the politicians of the two countries hoping to discuss the situation arising from the US ruling group's activities to accelerate ratification of the Paris Accords.

Bolz held talks with Polish Prime Minister Cyrekiewicz and Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski. The Democratic Republic of Germany's ambassador to Poland, Hermann, also participated in the talks. On March 5, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, Beirut, received Bolz.

The statement points out that the talks were based on the principles of the Moscow Declaration, and both sides affirmatively stated that the people of both countries, like the people of all countries neighboring Germany, hope that Germany can be united in a peaceful and democratic manner. Solving the German problem is incompatible with ratifying the Paris Accords.

The statement says that the talks are an expression of the desire of the People's Republic of Poland and the Democratic Republic of Germany to further expand cooperation between the two friendly countries in all extremely important aspects. In addition, issues related to ending the state of war between Poland and Germany were also discussed.

The peace-loving public of the People's Republic of Poland and the Democratic Republic of Germany expressed their support for the struggle of the patriotic forces of all countries neighboring Germany against the policy of West German remilitarization that threatens the peace of Europe.

British Communist Party Condemns British Government's Decision on Manufacturing and Using Hydrogen Bombs
Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. According to TASS London, the 5th: The British Communist Party's Political Committee issued a statement pointing out that the British government's decision on manufacturing and using hydrogen bombs puts Britain in extremely serious danger.

The statement said: "This decision, coupled with the policy of rearming West Germany, constitutes a plan to launch a new world war using atomic and hydrogen bombs." The statement said: The Soviet Union's proposals on destroying and banning all atomic and hydrogen weapons, guaranteeing the implementation of this ban under international supervision, and reducing armaments are in line with the true interests of the British people and all mankind.

The statement criticized the attitude of the right-wing leaders of the British Labour Party, who supported the government's criminal policy despite the opposition of almost every workers' organization.

The British Communist Party's Political Committee finally called for launching a broad movement to protest the government's policies, demand the abolition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and fight against West German rearmament and for the immediate adoption of international agreements to reduce all armaments.

    各国妇女共同反对原子武器
    杜真
    第二次世界大战使各国成千成万母亲和妻子们丧失了她们的亲人，人们对这个惨痛的灾难记忆犹新，而帝国主义战争集团今天又威胁着要使用原子武器和大规模毁灭性武器来发动一场新的战争，各国妇女对此不能不感到严重的不安和无比的愤怒。因此，各国妇女积极参加了反对战争和原子武器的斗争，她们强烈地发出自己的呼声，要求制止和粉碎原子狂人们的万恶企图。
    一九五○年，各国妇女和全世界人民一道在要求禁止使用原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。这一世界性的巨大运动，对于动员各国人民，团结起来反对原子武器、保卫世界和平起了重大的作用。爱好和平人民的强大力量和广泛动员，使得美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜和干涉印度支那的战争中不敢使用原子武器。
    最近几个月来，以美帝国主义为首的战争集团看到人民力量的迅速扩大而惊慌万状，它们正愈来愈频繁地进行原子恫吓，公开叫嚣并加紧准备原子战争。北大西洋侵略集团决定授权其军事人员使用原子武器，它们还要通过巴黎协定给予西德军国主义者以原子武器，美国在频繁地举行原子武器试验，并向中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家人民进行原子战争的威胁，英国也以公开宣布制造氢弹来威胁世界人民。因此各国妇女和各国人民正以新的努力和更大的规模来展开反对原子武器的斗争。
    这里应该特别提到日本妇女在反对原子武器斗争方面所表现的积极的战斗精神。许多有影响的妇女团体，如全日本妇女团体联合会、主妇联合会、全国区域妇女团体联络协议会、日本妇女有权者同盟、日本妇女和平协会等，代表着日本各阶层广大妇女，发表了要求禁止使用原子武器的声明，她们积极地投入日本人民的大规模反对原子武器签名运动。截至一月十五日为止，在日本已征集了二千二百多万个签名，约占日本人口的四分之一，这些签名大部分是妇女的签名或妇女所征集的。这个运动还在继续发展中。
    日本妇女还向全世界妇女和国际妇女组织发出了呼吁说：“曾经三次遭受原子武器和氢武器的灾害的日本人民，不能不吁请全世界每个有理性的人一致起来要求禁止制造、试验和使用氢弹之类的武器。”这个呼吁书已在全世界许多国家中大量散发，并且获得了各国广大妇女的支持。
    亚洲的其他国家，如印度和印度尼西亚的妇女和各国人民一道展开了反对原子武器的斗争。印度、印度尼西亚的妇女代表大会都通过了决议，号召妇女起来反对原子武器，反对原子战争。
    在欧洲，遭受过法西斯野兽残酷蹂躏和夜以继日的疯狂轰炸的妇女们，面对着复活希特勒“国防军”的严重威胁，不能不更加为本身和她们的孩子们的生命和安全担忧。她们不能眼看着把原子武器交给双手染满了欧洲妇女和儿童的鲜血的希特勒将军们。因此欧洲各国妇女把反对原子武器的斗争和反对武装西德，反对“巴黎协定”的斗争紧密地结合起来。法兰西妇女联盟向法国妇女发出呼吁说：
  “原子弹的威胁使反对武装西德的斗争更加迫切了。”英国妇女差不多在发起反对武装西德的运动的同时，也发起了全国性反对氢弹的请愿。拥有广大群众基础的英国妇女合作社协会，在最近一次代表大会上也号召反对武装西德，反对氢弹。
    在美国，虽然统治集团和其宣传机器竭力煽动战争歇斯底里，但是许多妇女小组，特别是母亲小组却正在形成中。这些小组和其他组织一道，勇敢地提出保卫民主自由、保卫和平、特别是反对原子战争危险的问题。全国许多地方的美国和平十字军的妇女部以及国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟的许多分会，都展开了要求禁止原子武器的运动。
    此外，在拉丁美洲、中东和近东的许多国家，妇女们都展开了反对原子武器的运动。
    日益高涨的各国妇女反对原子武器的斗争，已使各种不同政治、不同宗教信仰、不同阶层的广大妇女在一个共同的目标下团结起来，采取了共同行动，从而大大扩展了各国妇女保卫和平运动的声势和力量。现在除了民主妇女运动的国际组织——国际民主妇女联合会的各国会员团体之外，有着广大群众基础的其他国际妇女团体和全国性妇女团体，都呼吁反对原子武器。例如，国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟在瑞士、爱尔兰、日本、加拿大、美国、英国、瑞典的分会，都声明反对使用氢弹。英国的妇女合作组织、工党妇女和瑞典的妇女合作组织和社会民主党妇女、自由党妇女等都表示反对原子武器。挪威的一个最大的资产阶级妇女组织“主妇协会”决定发起反对氢弹的运动，并建议其他国家的姊妹组织采取同样的行动。
    现在各国妇女正积极响应世界和平理事会的号召，热烈地投入了各国人民声势浩大的反对使用原子武器的签名运动。国际民主妇女联合会号召全世界妇女团结起来，共同为支持世界和平理事会常务委员会的“告全世界人民书”，为坚决反对使用和制造大规模毁灭性武器而斗争。
    中国、苏联和各人民民主国家的妇女首先响应了这一号召。我们中国妇女积极响应并热烈参加了反对使用原子武器的签名运动，我们和世界各国妇女站在一起，坚决反对原子战争。苏联妇女反法西斯委员会发表声明，号召全体苏联妇女积极支持世界和平理事会的号召，并号召全世界妇女和全世界和平保卫者一起，和一切爱好和平的各国人民一起，要求销毁各国所有现存的原子武器和立刻停止制造这种武器。朝鲜、越南以及其他人民民主国家的妇女都和全国人民一起热烈欢迎和支持世界和平理事会的号召，展开全国性的反对使用原子武器的签名运动。
    各国妇女反对原子武器的斗争正以空前广泛的规模在不断壮大中，如果每一个母亲、每一个妇女都在世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”上签名，那将是亿万妇女反对原子武器的大示威。目前，在许多国家里，妇女们都把这次巨大的签名运动和将在今年七月间召开的全世界母亲代表大会的筹备工作结合起来。这次大会将是全世界母亲们反对战争、保卫孩子、要求裁减军备和各国人民之间的友谊的大会。毫无疑问，占全人类一半的妇女是反对原子战争的强大力量，她们和全世界人民的反对原子武器的坚强斗争，一定能够制止原子狂人们的罪恶计划，并达到将原子能用于和平与人类进步和繁荣的崇高目的。讨论因美国进行加速批准巴黎协定的活动所产生的局势民主德国副总理兼外长博尔茨访问华沙
    【新华社七日讯】　据塔斯社华沙六日讯：报纸发表了关于德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长洛塔·博尔茨访问华沙的正式公报。公报说，博尔茨访问波兰首都是由于这两国的政治家们希望讨论因为美国统治集团进行加速批准巴黎协定的活动所产生的局势。
    博尔茨同波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和外交部长斯克热歇夫斯基举行了会谈。德意志民主共和国驻波兰大使赫曼也参加了会谈。三月五日，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特接见了博尔茨。
    公报指出，会谈是从莫斯科宣言的原则出发的，双方在会谈中肯定地表明，两国人民和邻近德国的一切国家的人民一样，希望德国能够按照和平和民主的方针统一起来。德国问题的解决是同批准巴黎协定不相容的。
    公报说，这次会谈是波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国希望进一步扩大两个友好国家之间在一切极重要的方面进行合作的愿望的表示。此外还讨论了有关结束波兰和德国之间的战争状态的问题。
    波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的爱好和平的公众表示，他们声援同德国邻近的各国人民的爱国力量抵抗威胁欧洲和平的西德重新军国主义化政策的斗争。英共斥英政府关于制造和使用氢弹的决定
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社伦敦五日讯：英国共产党政治委员会发表声明，指出英国政府关于制造和使用氢弹的决定使英国处在极严重的危险之中。
    声明说：“这个决定同重新武装西德的政策配合在一起，就构成了发动一次使用原子弹和氢弹的新的世界大战的计划。”声明说：苏联关于销毁和禁止一切原子武器和氢武器、在国际监督下保证实施这种禁令和裁减军备的建议，是符合英国人民和全人类的真正利益的。
    声明斥责英国工党的右翼领导的态度，他们不顾几乎每一个工人组织的反对而支持政府这种罪恶政策。
    英国共产党政治委员会最后号召发动一个广泛的运动，来抗议政府的政策，要求废除原子武器和氢武器，并且为反对西德重新武装、为争取立即通过国际协议来裁减一切军备而斗争。
