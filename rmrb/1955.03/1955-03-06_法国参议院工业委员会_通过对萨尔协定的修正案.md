Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 5th: The French Republic's Senate Industry Production Committee, on March 3rd, while discussing the Paris Agreements, passed an amendment to the bill regarding the ratification of the Franco-German Saar Agreement.

The content of the amendment is: it proposes that, simultaneously with the exchange of ratification documents for the Paris Agreements, a Franco-Saar Agreement guaranteeing French interests in the Saar be concluded.

That is to say, if the bill to ratify the Paris Agreements is passed, then the conclusion of a Franco-Saar Agreement would be a prerequisite for the Paris Agreements to take effect.

The Saar Agreement, which is an integral part of the Paris Agreements, stipulates that the aforementioned agreement between France and the Saar, guaranteeing French economic interests, can only be concluded after the Saar Agreement is ratified.

According to the French constitution, if this amendment is passed by the Senate of the Republic, the Paris Agreements will be returned to the National Assembly for further discussion. The Associated Press reports that this amendment passed by the Industry Production Committee is only the "first of a series of amendments to be proposed" by those in the Senate of the Republic who oppose the Paris Agreements, in order to reject or delay the ratification of these agreements. The report points out that the Faure government, which is attempting to quickly obtain ratification of the Paris Agreements, will face "an arduous struggle."

    法国参议院工业委员会
    通过对萨尔协定的修正案
    【新华社五日讯】巴黎消息：法国共和国参议院工业生产委员会三月三日在讨论巴黎协定问题时，对关于批准法—德萨尔协定的法案通过了一项修正案。
    修正案的内容是：提议在互换巴黎协定批准书的同时，缔结保障法国在萨尔的利益的法国—萨尔协定。
    这就是说，如果批准巴黎协定的法案得到通过的话，那就得把缔结法国—萨尔协定作为巴黎协定生效的先决条件。
    作为巴黎协定的组成部分的萨尔协定规定，只有在萨尔协定批准以后，才能缔结法国和萨尔问题于保障法国经济利益的上述协定。
    根据法国宪法，如果这个修正案被共和国参议院通过的话，巴黎协定就将被交还国民议会重新讨论。合众社消息说，工业生产委员会所通过的这个修正案，只是共和国参议院中反对巴黎协定的人们为否决或延迟批准这些协定的“将要提出的一系列修正案的第一个”。消息指出，企图使巴黎协定赶快获得批准的富尔政府将有“一场艰苦的斗争”。
