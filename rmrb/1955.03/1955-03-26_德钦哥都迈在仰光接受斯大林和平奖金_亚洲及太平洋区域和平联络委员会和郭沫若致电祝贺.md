Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, March 23rd, via TASS: The distinguished peace fighter, Burmese writer Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, received the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize in Rangoon on March 22nd.

At 5:00 PM, more than 7,000 people gathered in front of the Rangoon City Hall. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, the recipient of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, and Gikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, were warmly welcomed as they ascended the podium.

U Aung Lah, professor at Rangoon University and chairman of the Burma-Soviet Cultural Association, announced the opening. In his brief introduction, he praised the laureate as a heroic fighter dedicated to the sacred cause of fighting for the freedom of the Burmese people, for the independence of his motherland, and for peace. Professor U Aung Lah concluded by extending warm congratulations to the laureate.

The Soviet writer Gikhonov then spoke, and everyone listened attentively. Gikhonov said that the Burmese people affectionately call the laureate "teacher." He said that one cannot remain unmoved when reading the records of your inspiring and heroic life, dedicated to the cause of the people, to the cause of peace, and to international friendship. As an outstanding representative of Burmese culture, you have used your sharp words to denounce those who plot to weaken the people's resistance to foreign aggressors, and those who try to flatter the aggressors who conquered their motherland. You have encouraged the true sons and daughters of Burma to perform meritorious deeds and engage in peaceful labor for the glory of an independent and happy Burma.

Gikhonov concluded by congratulating Thakin Kodaw Hmaing on his new achievements in strengthening the friendship between the Soviet and Burmese people and defending world peace.

Next, the decision of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace" Committee to award the prize to Thakin Kodaw Hmaing was read in Russian and Burmese. Gikhonov presented the laureate with the certificate and pinned the gold medal on his chest. At this moment, a storm of cheers erupted from the audience.

Then, representatives from all walks of life in Burma went to the stage to warmly congratulate the laureate.

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing spoke with great emotion.

He first expressed his gratitude for being awarded the honor of the Stalin International Peace Prize. He said: "The Burmese people have a glorious tradition of resisting foreign rule. From the time the British annexed Burma, Burmese patriots, unwilling to see their country enslaved, fought for freedom for twelve years." "Unable to endure the oppression of British imperialism, the Burmese peasants, led by Saya San, launched the famous Galon armed uprising. Later, the Dobama Asiayone (whose purpose was to liberate the country from British rule; before World War II, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing served as the chairman of this party) resolutely carried out the struggle despite arrests, imprisonment, and all kinds of hardships. Their only purpose was to achieve national independence. In addition, when the Japanese fascists invaded Burma, the Burmese people carried out a resistance movement until these fascist beasts were completely withdrawn. Then, they fought against the British, who returned to Burma after the war, to win complete independence. Therefore, people can believe that the Burmese people will never give up their freedom and independence to foreign aggressors and interventionists."

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing then pointed out: "At this time, there are many tasks that the Burmese people must accomplish together with the people of the world. Atomic and hydrogen weapons must be banned. Atomic and hydrogen weapons currently stockpiled must be destroyed. Tests of atomic and hydrogen weapons must be stopped. Atomic energy must be used to serve mankind. On this issue, I would like to congratulate the Soviet people for supporting the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the destruction of existing atomic and hydrogen weapons, the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and the use of atomic energy for the service of mankind. In addition, we must protest the formation of war blocs. Of particular importance to Burma is protesting the formation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. We must not only strive to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, but also strive for universal disarmament. While opposing war blocs and striving for universal disarmament, we must strive to expand peace zones. In this regard, I believe that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced in the joint communique of the Prime Ministers of Burma, India, and the People's Republic of China provide the most appropriate basis. The Burmese people and the people of the world should support these five principles and demand that all countries accept them."

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing concluded by saying: "I believe that the awarding of the Stalin Peace Prize to me is to encourage me and the people of Burma to redouble our efforts to fight for peace. For these reasons, I would like to accept the Stalin Peace Prize on behalf of the Burmese people, on behalf of the defenders of independence and peace, on behalf of writers, artists, cultural workers, and scholars. I will cherish this certificate. I will wear this medal with pride.

As for the prize money, I will use it as a fund to build a People's Peace Culture Palace, and I am confident that the Burmese people will enthusiastically support this plan."

[Xinhua News Agency, March 25th] The Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee sent a telegram on the 17th to the distinguished peace fighter, Burmese writer Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, congratulating him on receiving the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize.

    德钦哥都迈在仰光接受斯大林和平奖金
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会和郭沫若致电祝贺
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社仰光二十三日讯：杰出的和平战士、缅甸作家德钦哥都迈三月二十二日在仰光接受“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金。
    下午五时，七千多人聚集在仰光市政厅前。“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的得奖人德钦哥都迈和苏联保卫和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫等人登上讲台时受到了热烈的欢迎。
    仰光大学教授、缅苏文化协会主席吴昂拉宣布开幕。他在简短的介绍词中，赞扬得奖人是献身于争取缅甸人民的自由、争取他的祖国的独立和争取和平的神圣事业的英勇战士。吴昂拉教授最后对得奖人表示热烈的祝贺。
    苏联作家吉洪诺夫接着讲话，大家都注意倾听。吉洪诺夫说，缅甸人民都亲切地把得奖人称为“老师”。他说，人们在读到您献身于人民的事业、献身于和平和国际友谊的事业的富有教育意义的英雄生活的记录时，是不能无动于衷的。作为缅甸文化的卓越的代表者，您曾经用您的辛辣的话语痛斥过图谋削弱人民对外国侵略者进行的抵抗的那些人，痛斥过企图阿谀征服他们的祖国的侵略者的那些人。您曾经鼓励缅甸人民的真正子女为一个独立、幸福的缅甸的光荣而建立功绩和进行和平的劳动。
    吉洪诺夫最后祝贺德钦哥都迈在加强苏缅人民的友谊和保卫世界和平的事业中取得新的成就。
    接着，用俄语和缅甸语宣读了“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会关于把奖金授给德钦哥都迈的决定。吉洪诺夫授给得奖人以奖状，并在他的衣襟上挂上金质奖章。这时，台下响起了暴风雨般的欢呼声。
    接着缅甸各界代表们都走上台去，热烈地向得奖人道贺。
    德钦哥都迈非常激动地讲话。
    他首先对于被授予斯大林国际和平奖金的荣誉表示感激。他说：“缅甸人民有着反抗外国统治的光荣传统。从英国人并吞缅甸时起，不让他们的祖国受到奴役的缅甸爱国人士为争取自由战斗了十二年。”“由于不能忍受英帝国主义者的压迫，缅甸农民们在萨雅·哈德的领导下发动了有名的加尔武装起义。后来，我缅人党（它的宗旨为将国家从英国统治下解放出来。在第二次世界大战以前，德钦哥都迈担任这个党的主席）不顾逮捕、监禁以及各种苦难，坚决进行斗争。他们唯一的目的是要实现民族独立。此外，当日本法西斯侵入缅甸时，缅甸人民进行了抵抗运动，直到这些法西斯野兽完全撤退为止。接着，又对在大战后回到缅甸的英国人进行斗争，争取完全的独立。因此，人们可以相信，缅甸人民将永远不会对外国侵略者和干涉者放弃他们的自由和独立。”
    德钦哥都迈接着指出：“在这个时候，有许多任务要缅甸人民同全世界人民一起来完成。原子武器和氢武器必须禁止。目前储存的原子武器和氢武器必须销毁。原子武器和氢武器的试验必须停止。原子能必须用来为人类服务。在这个问题上，我要向苏联人民祝贺，他们支持禁止原子武器和氢武器，销毁现存的原子武器和氢武器，停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，利用原子能为人类服务。此外我们还必须抗议成立战争集团。对缅甸特别重要的是抗议成立东南亚条约组织。我们不仅必须努力争取禁止原子武器和氢武器，而且必须努力争取普遍裁减军备。在反对战争集团和争取普遍裁减军备的同时，我们必须努力争取扩大和平地区。在这方面，我认为缅甸、印度和中华人民共和国总理的联合公报中所宣布的和平共处五项原则提供了最适当的基础。缅甸人民和全世界人民应该支持这五项原则并要求所有国家加以接受。”
    德钦哥都迈最后说：“我相信，授给我斯大林和平奖金就是鼓励我和缅甸的人民加倍努力来为和平进行斗争。为了这些理由，我谨代表缅甸人民，代表独立与和平的保卫者，代表作家、艺术家、文化工作者和学者，接受斯大林和平奖金。我将珍重这张奖状。我将以自豪的心情佩带这枚奖章。
    至于奖金，我将用它来作为建筑一个人民和平文化宫的基金，我深信缅甸人民将热忱地支持这个计划。”
