The Changchun Public Security Bureau held a reward ceremony for model public security guards on February 11th. At the meeting, two model public security committees, twenty-four model public security groups, and five hundred and forty-nine model public security guards and outstanding public security workers were rewarded and commended.

These model units and model workers have demonstrated a high degree of vigilance and enthusiasm in actively mobilizing the masses and assisting the government in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders, effectively safeguarding the country's economic construction and maintaining the safety of the people's lives and property. The public security committees of Shengli and Yongchang Streets educated and mobilized the masses to report more than 340 pieces of information related to counter-revolutionaries in the past year. The Shengli Street Public Security Committee recovered more than 114 million yuan (old currency) in evaded taxes through their reports in the past year. Kang Yanhai, a special-class model public security guard, had his roof blown off by a strong wind. When he climbed up to repair it, he saw that the roof of a nearby state granary had also been blown off. He immediately put down his own work and climbed onto the roof of the state granary, ignoring the wind and sand, using his body to hold down the roof cover and calling on everyone to help rescue the grain, so that the public grain was not damaged. Hu Shuguang, a public security officer of Shengli Street, smelled a burning smell on his way home from a meeting at night. He immediately went to each household to search and inquire, but found nothing; unable to rest easy, he went to the fire brigade, and as a result, he discovered that the straw mat in the back room of Qu Yisheng's house in the 14th group was on fire. Fortunately, it was discovered early and extinguished in time, preventing a fire.

At the meeting, the Changchun Public Security Bureau also pointed out the arduous and complex nature of future public security tasks, and required public security personnel to heighten their vigilance, maintain close ties with the masses, and mobilize and organize the masses to do a good job in public security work to protect the country's economic construction, ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, and support the liberation of Taiwan.

    长春公安局奖励治安保卫模范
    长春市公安局在二月十一日召开了奖励治安保卫模范大会。会上奖励和表扬了两个模范治安保卫委员会、二十四个模范治安保卫小组和五百四十九名治安保卫模范和优秀治安保卫工作者。
    这些模范单位和模范工作者在积极带动群众，协助政府与反革命分子和刑事罪犯进行斗争中，表现了高度的警惕性和积极性，有力地保卫了国家经济建设，维护了人民生命财产的安全。胜利、永长两个街的治安保卫委员会，在过去一年内就教育和带动了群众检举有关反革命分子的材料三百四十多件。胜利街治安保卫委员会在去年一年内，经他们检举后追回的偷漏税额就有一亿一千四百多万元（旧币）。特等治安保卫模范康彦海在一次大风把他家屋顶刮坏，他搬梯子上房修补时，看见附近国家粮仓的顶盖也被风刮坏了，他马上搁下了自己的活，爬上国家的粮仓顶，不顾风沙吹打，用自己的身体压住了仓盖，呼喊大家来抢救，使得公粮没有受到损失。胜利街治安保卫员胡曙光晚上开完会回家时，突然嗅到一股焦火味，他马上到各户去寻找打听，没有找到；回家后放心不下，又跑去找消防队，结果在十四组居民曲以生家的后屋内发现草垫着了火，幸亏发现较早及时加以扑灭，才没有引起火灾。
    会上长春市公安局还指出了今后治安保卫任务的艰巨复杂性，要求治安保卫人员提高警惕，密切联系群众，带动和组织群众做好治安保卫工作来保卫国家经济建设，保障人民生命财产的安全，支援解放台湾。
