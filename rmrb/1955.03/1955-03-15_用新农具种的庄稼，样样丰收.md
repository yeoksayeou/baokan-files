"Crops Planted with New Farm Tools, Every One is a Bumper Harvest"
    Li Mingfa, Wang Jiaping, Wang Zhongyuan
    When you walk through the fields of Wukeshu Village in Yushu County, Jilin Province, you will surely see: the land here has changed! The old barren soil of many years has seen the sky! Looking at the rows of flat land turned up by new farm tools, one cannot help but think: hard-working farmers are, under the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, heading towards a beautiful and happy future day by day.
    This area is a large piece of land that the Wukeshu Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Yushu County, Jilin Province, has helped farmers to turn over. This land has brought bumper harvests to farmers for two consecutive years.
    The Wukeshu Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Jilin Province was established in the autumn of 1952. From 1952 to 1953, the station guided seven villages, ten agricultural production cooperatives, and one mutual aid group, promoting eleven sets of new-style animal-powered farm tools. By the spring of 1954, the guidance scope of the technology extension station had expanded to nine villages and twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives, and the number of new farm tools had increased to twenty-six sets, using the new farm tools to plant various crops on more than 588 hectares of land. Now its guidance scope has expanded again. In the past two years, the land cultivated with new farm tools has generally achieved bumper harvests. The average yield per hectare of land planted with new farm tools reached 3,314 jin, an increase of 631 jin per hectare compared to land planted with old farm tools, representing an increase of 23.51%; among them, soybeans increased by 21%, sorghum increased by 25%, millet and corn both increased by more than 20%, and wheat increased by more than 40%. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jiefang Village planted 6 hectares and 7 fen and 9 li of soybean with new farm tools, with an average yield of 4,776 jin per hectare, an increase of 1,738 jin per hectare compared to land planted with old farm tools. The Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of the same village planted 9 mu and 4 fen of soybean with new farm tools, with an average yield of 5,832 jin per hectare, more than doubling the yield compared to land planted with old farm tools.
    The use of new farm tools has led to the reform of farming methods. The implementation of narrowing ridges and increasing rows has increased the planting area and greatly improved land utilization. According to the land cultivated with old farm tools, the ridge width is generally about 2.1 to 2.2 chi. The row spacing for planting soybeans, sorghum, millet, corn, etc. with seeders is 60 centimeters (1.8 chi). The land planted with new farm tools generally reduces the width of each large ridge by 3 cun compared to land planted with old farm tools. In this way, one hectare of land can increase the effective utilization area by 1 mu and 5 fen. In 1954, the entire station cultivated 588 hectares, 3 mu, and 4 fen of land with new farm tools. Due to narrowing ridges and increasing rows, the effective utilization area of the land can be increased by more than 88 hectares. If calculated at an average yield of 2,500 jin of grain per hectare, it can increase grain production by more than 220,000 jin. The masses reflected:
  “Planting land with old farm tools wastes land fertility due to the large ridges. New farm tools change large ridges to small ridges, increase the number of rows, and loosen the soil with denser plants, so more grain can be harvested.”
    New farm tools have increased the yield per unit area, and farmers' income has greatly increased. Taking the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Wukeshu Township as an example: In 1954, it only planted 6 hectares, 2 mu, and 4 fen of land with new farm tools, but harvested 11,612 jin more grain than with old farm tools. In order to cultivate all the land with new-style farm tools in 1955, this cooperative specially connected the land sections when plowing in the autumn last year, turning the original more than 50 scattered plots into neat, uniform, large tracts of land.
    New farm tools have promoted the development of mutual aid and cooperation. Some mutual aid groups actively requested to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives in order to use new farm tools, so as to open up land boundaries and concentrate the use of horses for plowing. Some individual farmers saw that cooperatives harvested more grain using new farm tools and also actively requested to join the cooperative. An old farmer from Wangjia Wobao Village in Aiguo Village saw that the First Cooperative of Wukeshu Township had achieved a bumper harvest using new farm tools, and came to request joining the cooperative three times with his horse. After the autumn of 1954, this agricultural cooperative had expanded from twenty households to thirty-seven households.
    There are seventeen villages in the Wukeshu District, with an original thirty-three agricultural production cooperatives; after the autumn of 1954, it has increased to eighty-four. With the vigorous development of local mutual aid and cooperation and the masses' demand for improved farming techniques, the technology extension station has now expanded the scope of technical guidance to ten villages, seventy-one agricultural production cooperatives, and eight mutual aid groups; the number of new farm tools promoted will increase from the original twenty-six sets to sixty-two sets. At present, within the ten villages including Changxin and Zhengyi, which are guided by the technology extension station, eight villages have basically been cooperativized; in these eight villages, the farm households participating in the cooperative have reached 87% of the total farm households; among them, Changxin Village, the focus of the extension station, has 278 households in the whole village. Except for one non-agricultural household, all have joined the eight agricultural cooperatives, and these agricultural cooperatives have all used new farm tools.
    Now, the new farm tools of the Wukeshu Technology Extension Station are in a state of "supply exceeding demand." Many newly established agricultural production cooperatives rush to the extension station to "register," requesting to use new farm tools. Since last autumn, the extension station has received more than forty "applications" requesting the use of new farm tools. The villages and hamlets under the jurisdiction of Wukeshu Town originally had two agricultural cooperatives. After the harvest last year, six new agricultural cooperatives were established. In these villages and hamlets, some farmers even proposed the "condition" of issuing new farm tools as a requirement for establishing a cooperative to the village cadres during the preparation period for establishing the cooperative.
    During the autumn plowing period in 1954, 79 agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups using new farm tools dispatched 113 sets of double-wheeled double-furrow plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows to participate in autumn plowing. In the operation, many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups adopted the method of "resting people and horses but not resting the plow," plowing the land from dawn to dusk. The staff of the technology extension station also went deep into the fields for technical guidance, working tirelessly. The entire station originally planned to plow 766 hectares, but by the time of freezing, it had actually completed 964.85 hectares. Including spring plowing, the area of land cultivated with new farm tools in 1955 will increase to more than 2,800 hectares, accounting for 36.7% of the total cultivated area of the villages within the guidance scope of the station. Among them, Changxin and Jiefang Villages, which are the focus of technical guidance by the technology extension station, will have the sowing area with new farm tools in 1955 reaching more than 50% of the total cultivated area of each village.
    The fact of bumper harvests in the past two years has led more and more farmers to abandon the old and clumsy "hook plow" and fall in love with new-style farm tools from the bottom of their hearts. Now, everywhere in this area, you can hear farmers' praise for new farm tools. A folk rhyme is popular among the farmers in Changxin Village:
  "Double-furrow plow, plows deep, turns thoroughly; the seeder plants seeds more evenly than hand-planting one by one, the sorghum ears grow like oil bottles!"
    An old farmer surnamed Liu from the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Changxin Village said with great interest: "New farm tools ensure a good harvest no matter what crops you plant. We farmers 'don't cast an eagle until we see the rabbit.' Now our cooperative uses new farm tools to harvest more grain for every crop. The government is spreading honey on our mouths, who wouldn't want to eat this sweetness!"

    “用新农具种的庄稼，样样丰收”
    李明发　王家平　王中原
    当你走过吉林省榆树县五棵树村的田野的时候，一定就会看到：这里的土地变了样啦！多年的老生土都见了天！看看那用新农具翻起的一排排平整的大地，不由得会想到：勤劳的农民正在共产党和人民政府的领导、帮助下，一天天地走向美好、幸福的未来。
    这一带是吉林省榆树县五棵树农业技术推广站帮助农民翻过的大片土地。这一片土地，已经是一连两年把丰收的果实带给农民了。
    吉林省五棵树农业技术推广站是在一九五二年秋季建立起来的。从一九五二年到一九五三年，全站指导七个村、十个农业生产合作社和一个互助组，推广了十一套新式畜力农具。到一九五四年春，技术推广站的指导范围又扩大到九个村、二十六个农业生产合作社，新农具增加到二十六套，用新农具播种了各种作物五百八十八垧多地。现在它的指导范围又扩大了。两年来用新农具耕种的土地普遍地获得了丰收。用新农具种的地平均每垧产量达三千三百一十四斤，比用旧农具种的地平均每垧多收六百三十一斤，增产百分之二十三点五一；其中大豆增产百分之二十一，高粱增产百分之二十五，谷子和玉米增产都在百分之二十以上，小麦增产百分之四十以上。解放村第一农业生产合作社用新农具种的六垧七亩九分地大豆，平均每垧产四千七百七十六斤，比用旧农具种的地平均每垧多收一千七百三十八斤。同村第二农业生产合作社用新农具种的九亩四分地的大豆，平均每垧产五千八百三十二斤，比用旧农具种的地增产一倍多。
    使用新农具引起了耕作方法的改革。由于实行了缩垅增行，增加了播种面积，大大地提高了土地利用率。按用旧农具耕种的土地，垅宽一般都在二尺一寸到二尺二寸左右，用播种机播种大豆、高粱、谷子、玉米等的行距为六十公分（一尺八寸），用新农具种的地，一般比用旧农具种的每条大垅缩小三寸，这样，一垧地即可增加一亩五分地的有效利用面积。全站一九五四年共用新农具耕种五百八十八垧三亩四分地，由于缩垅增行，可增加八十八垧多地的土地有效利用面积，如以平均每垧收粮二千五百斤计算，可增产二十二万多斤粮食。群众反映：
  “用旧农具种地垅大浪费地力，新农具大垅改小垅，增加行数，棵密地渲，所以能多打粮食。”
    新农具提高了单位面积产量，农民的收入大大增加了。以五棵树城乡第一农业生产合作社为例：一九五四年仅用新农具种了六垧二亩四分地，比旧农具多打了一万一千六百一十二斤粮食。这个社为了在一九五五年用新式农具耕种全部土地，在去年秋季翻地时，特别串好地段，把原来五十多块零星的地块，串成了整整齐齐的、垅向划一的大片地。
    新农具促进了互助合作的发展。有些互助组为了使用新农具，积极要求转为农业生产合作社，以便打开地界，集中使用马匹耕地。有些单干农民看到合作社使用新农具多打了粮食，也积极要求入社。爱国村王家窝堡屯的一个老农民看到五棵树城乡第一合作社使用新农具获得了丰收，三次牵着马来要求入社。在一九五四年秋后，这个农业社已由二十户扩大为三十七户。
    五棵树区共有十七个村，原有三十三个农业生产合作社；一九五四年秋后，已增加到八十四个。随着当地互助合作的蓬勃发展和群众对改进耕作技术的要求，技术推广站现在已把技术指导的范围扩大到十个村、七十一个农业生产合作社、八个互助组；推广新农具的数量，将由原来二十六套增加到六十二套。目前，技术推广站所指导的长新、正义等十个村内，已有八个村基本合作化了；这八个村内参加合作社的农户已达到总农户的百分之八十七；其中推广站的重点——长新村，全村二百七十八户，除一户非农业户外，已全部参加到八个农业社里面，这些农业社已全部使用了新农具。
    现在，五棵树技术推广站的新农具已呈现“供不应求”的状况，很多新建的农业生产合作社。争先恐后地到推广站去“挂号”，要求使用新农具。自去秋以来推广站已收到有四十多张要求使用新农具的“申请书”。五棵树镇所属各自然村、屯原有两个农业社，去年挂锄后又新建立六个农业社，在这些村、屯里，有些农民在筹备建社期间，甚至向村干部提出以发给新农具为建社的“条件”。
    在一九五四年秋翻作业期间，七十九个使用新农具的农业社和互助组出动了一百一十三台双轮双铧犁和双轮一铧犁参加秋翻地。在作业中，很多农业社和互助组采取了“歇人歇马不歇犁”的办法，起早贪黑地翻地。技术推广站的工作人员也不辞辛苦地深入田间进行技术指导，全站原计划翻地七六六垧，到结冻前为止，实际上已完成了九百六十四点八五垧。加上春翻，一九五五年使用新农具耕种的土地面积将增加到二千八百垧以上，占全站指导范围内的各村总耕地面积的百分之三十六点七。其中由技术推广站重点指导的长新、解放两村，一九五五年使用新农具播种面积将达到占各该村总耕地面积的百分之五十以上。
    两年来丰产的事实，使得越来越多的农民抛弃了那古老而拙笨的“弯钩犁”，从心里爱上了新式农具。现在这一带到处都可听到农民对新农具赞美的评语。在长新村的农民中流行着这样快板：
  “双铧犁，耕的深，翻的透；播种机下籽儿比用手一个一个摆的还匀整，长起来高粱穗子像油瓶！”
    长新村第一农业生产合作社一个姓刘的老年农民兴致勃勃地说：“新农具种啥庄稼，都保险多打粮，咱们庄稼人是‘不见兔子不撒鹰’，如今咱社用新农具种的庄稼，样样多打粮，政府往咱嘴上抹蜂蜜，谁不要这个甜头儿吃呢！ ”
