    Defamation and Delusions
    Observer
    On March 5th, the British Information Services released a commentary entitled "Bangkok and Geneva." In this commentary, in order to conceal Britain's dangerous path of following the United States in deviating from the Geneva Accords, it tried its best to distort the Chinese people's position in maintaining the Geneva Accords and made blatant slander against the People's Republic of China.
    The British Information Services commentary insisted that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's inclusion of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam in the "protected" area does not violate the Geneva Accords, arguing that neither the Southeast Asia Treaty nor the Bangkok Conference made them join a military alliance. However, forcibly including these countries, which the Geneva Accords stipulate must not join military alliances, into the treaty area of the Southeast Asia military alliance and imposing "protection" on them is the first step to further dragging them into a military alliance. This violates the Geneva Accords. Some people also want to imitate their practice of creating the so-called undetermined legal status of Taiwan issue, in order to "legally" drag Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia military alliance. They say that whether these countries' participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization constitutes a violation of the Geneva Accords is "a job for legal experts to explain." This is obviously because they know that doing so violates the Geneva Accords, but they attempt to create so-called "legal" disputes to confuse the public and achieve their goals. This is not permissible.
    The British Information Services followed the United States in slandering China for "turning its threatening gaze toward Indochina," trying to shift the responsibility for "involving Indochina in military action" onto China.
    However, what threatens the peace of Indochina is the "military action" that the United States is creating there. The United States is expanding the South Vietnamese army, and Dulles personally went to Laos and Cambodia to engage in army training programs and plot the conclusion of military agreements. The United States also instigated armed bandits to attack the assembly areas of the Laotian combat troops. What particularly aroused the indignation of the Chinese people is that the United States brazenly disregarded everything and sent the Kuomintang remnant forces to this assembly area to carry out riots. All these military actions are increasingly seriously threatening the peace of Indochina and threatening China's security. The United States should bear full responsibility for the consequences of these military actions.
    The commentator of the British Information Services fears the efforts of friendly cooperation among Asian countries to expand peaceful regions, fearing that this would be detrimental to the rule of colonial countries. Therefore, it came to slander the Chinese people, insisting that "all Chinese remember China's ancient tradition as a Chinese empire (a great political and civilized center, with all neighboring countries becoming its satellites revolving around it)." He wants to slander the Chinese people for engaging in imperialism, trying to use this to provoke the relationship of peaceful cooperation among Asian countries. In order to achieve this goal, he also wants to slander China's conscription system, an institution that has long been implemented in Britain and the United States.
    However, this approach is futile.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy and actively developed international friendly cooperative relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is recognized by most of China's neighbors. Conversely, it is the United States and Britain that have long carried out imperialist colonial rule over Asian countries and still try to maintain and expand this colonial rule. It is precisely the United States that is attempting to threaten Asian countries with so-called "strength," to control them with so-called "economic aid," and to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries with so-called "anti-subversion activities." It is also precisely the British authorities that are following the United States in doing so in all aspects.
    Despite the fact that the British Information Services commentator slanders the Chinese people, he cannot hide their intention to try to follow the United States and obstruct Asian countries from implementing independence and autonomy. He said that the Chinese people's "disgust with the Southeast Asia Treaty" is to "make its (China's) neighbors fall into a position where they have no one to turn to except China." This precisely shows that they believe that Asian countries cannot be independent and autonomous, and must "turn to" other countries, that is, colonial countries, and be controlled by colonial countries.
    The reason why they want to establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is precisely to realize these kinds of delusions.

    诽谤和狂想
    观察家
    英国新闻处五日发表了一篇题为“曼谷和日内瓦”的评论。这篇评论，为了掩盖英国追随美国走着背离日内瓦协议的危险道路，竭力歪曲中国人民维护日内瓦协议的立场，并对中华人民共和国进行公然的诽谤。
    英国新闻处的评论硬说，东南亚条约把老挝、柬埔寨和南越列入“保护”区域，并不违反日内瓦协议，理由是，东南亚条约和曼谷会议都没有使它们参加军事联盟。但是，把日内瓦协议规定不得参加军事同盟的这些国家，硬划入东南亚军事联盟的条约区域之内强加“保护”，这就是要把它们进一步拖入军事联盟的第一步。这就是违反日内瓦协议的。有人还想仿照他们制造所谓台湾法律地位未定的问题的做法，来把老挝、柬埔寨和南越“合法地”拖入东南亚军事联盟。他们说什么如果这些国家参加东南亚条约组织，是否构成违反日内瓦协定，那是“法学专家来说明的工作”。这显然是因为他们明知这样做是违反日内瓦协议的，却企图制造所谓“法律”争论来混淆视听，以便欺骗人民，达到目的。这是不能容许的。
    英国新闻处跟随美国，诽谤中国“已把它的威胁的眼光转向印度支那”，想把使印度支那“卷入军事行动以内”的责任推在中国身上。
    但是威胁印度支那和平的是美国正在那里制造的“军事行动”。美国在扩大南越军队，杜勒斯也亲自到老挝和柬埔寨搞训练军队计划，并策划缔结军事协定。美国还指使武装匪徒侵袭寮国战斗部队的集结区。特别激起中国人民愤慨的是，美国竟悍然不顾一切地把国民党残余部队派到这个集结区去进行暴乱。这一切军事行动，日益严重地威胁着印度支那的和平，威胁着中国的安全。美国应该对这些军事行动的后果负完全的责任。
    英国新闻处的评论家害怕亚洲国家间友好合作，扩大和平地区的努力，害怕这对于殖民国家的统治不利，因此，它便来诽谤中国人民，硬说“所有中国人都记着中国作为一个中华帝国（一个伟大的政治性的文明中心，一切邻国都成为它的卫星国围绕在它的周围）的古老传统”。他想诬蔑中国人民要搞帝国主义，想借此来挑拨亚洲国家和平合作的关系。为了达到这个目的，他还想诽谤中国的义务兵役制这样一件在英国和美国早已实施的制度。
    但是，这种作法是徒劳的。
    中华人民共和国建国以来，一直奉行和平外交政策，积极在和平共处的五项原则的基础上发展国际友好合作关系。这是中国的大多数邻国所公认的。相反地，对亚洲国家长期进行帝国主义殖民统治，并且至今还力图保持和扩大这种殖民统治的却正是美国和英国。正是美国在企图用所谓“实力”来威胁亚洲国家，用所谓“经济援助”来控制它们，用所谓“反颠覆活动”来干涉亚洲国家内政。也正是英国当局在各方面追随美国这样做。
    尽管英国新闻处的评论家诽谤中国人民，但是他却不能掩盖他们力图追随美国、阻挠亚洲国家实行独立自主的用意。他说中国人民“厌恶东南亚条约”是要“使它（中国）的邻国陷于除了中国以外无可投靠的地位”。这恰恰表示他们认为亚洲国家是不能独立自主的，是必须“投靠”别国，也就是殖民国家，并受殖民国家控制的。
    他们所以要建立东南亚条约组织，也正是为了实现他们的这种种狂想。
