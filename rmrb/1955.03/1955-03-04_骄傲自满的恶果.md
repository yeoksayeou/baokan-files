    Recently, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province dealt with the incident of Wang Zisheng, the former Party Branch Secretary of the Coking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and others suppressing democracy and retaliating against critics. Wang Zisheng was expelled from the Party, and other Communist Party members who made mistakes were also subjected to Party disciplinary action. Zhang Baotong and others, Communist Party members who insisted on the truth and safeguarded the interests of the Party but suffered retaliation, were commended and encouraged. This incident exposed the disastrous consequences caused by the complacency of some party cadres, which deserves high vigilance from all party comrades.
    The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party pointed out long ago that after the victory of the revolution, we must strictly prevent the growth of complacency and be vigilant against the erosion of the Party by bourgeois ideology. We must continue to maintain the working style of being modest, prudent, not arrogant, and not impetuous. In the past few years since the national liberation, most Communist Party members working in various positions, in accordance with this instruction, have worked diligently for the people's cause, maintained and carried forward the fine style of our Party, and have been loved and trusted by the people, thus making our Party enjoy a high prestige among the people. However, there are also many comrades who have forgotten the Party's instructions. After they have made some achievements under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, and have been praised by their superiors and the masses, they immediately become arrogant and conceited, turning the units under their leadership into "independent kingdoms," and turning the power given to them by the Party and the state into tools for pursuing fame and satisfying their personal despicable desires. If anyone dares to criticize their mistakes or shortcomings, they will be furious and immediately suppress and retaliate. Wang Zisheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Coking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, took the anti-Party road under such circumstances. Several other Communist Party members in this branch, such as Shi Li, the director of the Coking Department, and Cheng Zhanhai, the propaganda committee member of the branch, also committed serious mistakes along with Wang Zisheng due to their complacency and individualism.
    During Wang Zisheng's tenure as the Party Branch Secretary, the production work of the Coking Department did achieve certain results. However, Wang Zisheng did not attribute it to the correct leadership of the Party or to the efforts of all the staff and workers, but attributed it all to himself. Therefore, he became arrogant and conceited, and his bourgeois individualism also began to rise. In order to further show off his achievements and obtain so-called "honor," he did not hesitate to falsely report work achievements and deliberately exaggerate and fabricate the deeds of labor models. This not only concealed the true situation of the enterprise, making it impossible for the Party and the state to achieve correct leadership over the enterprise; but also distorted the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, which was resolutely opposed by honest workers and Communist Party members. After the newspapers continuously published untrue reports about the model deeds of the Coking Department, many workers had opinions and expressed their dissatisfaction. Zhang Baotong, the security chief of the Coking Department, timely reflected the workers' opinions to the Party branch and Wang Zisheng in order to safeguard the interests of the Party and the people, and also to help Wang Zisheng and others recognize and correct their mistakes. However, Wang Zisheng not only did not accept it, but instead retaliated against Zhang Baotong.
    The Party constantly teaches us: it is inevitable for a person to have some shortcomings and mistakes in their work; but as long as they have the spirit of strict criticism and self-criticism, dare to admit mistakes and resolutely correct them, instead of trying to cover up shortcomings and mistakes, they will not only not lose the trust of the Party and the people, but will also gain continuous progress and improvement, and will still be a good Communist Party member and revolutionary worker. This principle is very important and very easy to understand; however, it is difficult for those who are dizzy with victory and therefore become arrogant and conceited, and those who are deeply infected with bourgeois individualism to accept. When they are frantically pursuing their so-called personal "honor" and "status," even at the expense of violating Party discipline and state laws, it is often difficult to pull them back from the dangerous road. The logic of such people is completely opposite to ours. They do not think that admitting and correcting shortcomings and mistakes is a good performance, but think that it will make them lose "honor" and "status" and damage their "prestige." Therefore, they do not regard the criticism of comrades as well-intentioned help, but as an attack on themselves. For those who raise criticisms, if they are under their jurisdiction, their usual method is to abuse their power to arbitrarily counter-criticize the critics, and even stoop to fabricating some crimes against the critics, and then impose brutal attacks and retaliations. If the person who raises the opinion is not under their jurisdiction, for example, a cadre sent by their superior, their usual method is to passively resist, and even stoop to secretly creating and spreading dissatisfied public opinion, fabricating various facts out of thin air, and conducting vicious attacks and slanders, sometimes even developing into open resistance to inspection.
    Wang Zisheng and others used this attitude to treat the criticisms of the masses and the inspection of the superior authorities. After Zhang Baotong reflected to him the masses' opinions on the evaluation of labor models, he appointed someone to convene a meeting to reprimand the workers who raised the opinions as "treating steamed buns as dog feces," and "evil prevailing over righteousness," and threatened the masses with "preventing bad elements from taking advantage of loopholes"; at the same time, he also criticized Zhang Baotong for "following the backward masses" and slandered him as having "impure motives." When Zhang Baotong was not overwhelmed by intimidation and filed a complaint to the superior authorities, Wang Zisheng became even more angry. In order to remove Zhang Baotong, this "thorn in his side," and to prevent the Party and non-Party masses of the Coking Department from daring to oppose him, a Communist Party member with "achievements," he did not let go of any opportunity and did not hesitate to take any despicable means to frame Zhang Baotong and to slander the workers who raised opinions. Wang Zisheng and others used this despicable and shameless method of creating something out of nothing and reversing right and wrong to forcibly add serious charges such as "anti-Party, anti-leadership and non-organizational activities" to Zhang Baotong, held several meetings to struggle against him, forced him to admit his mistakes, expelled him from the Party, removed him from his position as the security chief, and also wanted to "eliminate the thoughts of people like Zhang Baotong inside and outside the Party." At the党员大会 (Party Member's Meeting) discussing the expulsion of Zhang Baotong from the Party, Wang Zisheng and others also absorbed several politically bad elements who had opinions on Zhang Baotong to participate in the meeting, and some of them even served as group leaders to lead the discussion on the issue of expelling Zhang Baotong from the Party. This shows that in order to achieve his personal despicable goals, Wang Zisheng had developed to the point of being unscrupulous and indistinguishable between the enemy and ourselves. Because the inspection team of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry conscientiously went deep into the masses and conducted investigations and studies in accordance with the principles of the Party, they told the truth. Wang Zisheng and others regarded the inspection team of the Iron and Steel Bureau as a thorn in their side, and also maliciously fabricated rumors and slanders against them, adding serious charges such as "questioning labor models, creating chaos, and affecting production," which made it impossible for their inspection to proceed smoothly. In this way, Wang Zisheng stepped onto the criminal road of opposing the Party and the people step by step.
    The reason why Wang Zisheng and others dared to suppress democracy so rampantly, and the matter developed more and more seriously, is inseparable from some mistakes of the superior leading organs. After comrades such as Zhang Baotong filed complaints, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Party Committee conducted an inspection, and then the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee organized an inspection team, and the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry also organized an inspection team. However, the practices of the two inspection teams were completely opposite. The inspection team of the Iron and Steel Bureau sought truth from facts, carefully checked the facts, relied on the working masses, quickly clarified the truth of the matter, and always supported the correct opinions of comrades such as Zhang Baotong. The main responsible persons of the provincial and municipal party committee inspection team and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Party Committee did not do this. They did not conduct serious investigations and studies, did not humbly listen to the opinions of the workers, and blindly listened to the reflections of the leadership of the Coking Department that distorted the facts. Moreover, the style of the responsible persons of the provincial and municipal party committee inspection team was very undemocratic. The inspection report was not discussed and approved by the group, and the correct opinions raised by some comrades in the group were not reflected to the provincial party committee. The inspection report made with this attitude and this method, of course, would not conform to the facts. These comrades subjectively and arbitrarily believed that the work of the Coking Department under their direct or indirect leadership was beyond doubt, the achievements they had praised would not be wrong, and the models they had rewarded would not be fake. They were unwilling to doubt what they had praised, and they were unwilling to hear anyone raise different opinions on their praise. Therefore, they not only did not believe the informants and the working masses, and did not support the correct opinions of the inspection team of the Iron and Steel Bureau, but some people even followed Wang Zisheng and others to rudely criticize the inspection team of the Iron and Steel Bureau.
    The Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee and the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee were aware of these principled differences of opinion, but when dealing with this incident, some responsible comrades of the provincial and municipal party committees still lacked the necessary vigilance against the possible emergence of fake models in the factories under their jurisdiction. They did not believe the facts revealed by Zhang Baotong and the investigation of the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau confirming the fake models; they blindly believed the achievements fabricated by Wang Zisheng and others and the investigation of the provincial and municipal party committee inspection team denying the existence of fake models. Therefore, the special report on the problems of the Coking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, made by the municipal party committee based on the report of the provincial and municipal party committee inspection team and approved by the provincial party committee, although pointed out the shortcomings and errors existing in the Coking Department and asked Wang Zisheng and others to examine themselves, the conclusion on Zhang Baotong was completely wrong. It basically echoed the opinions of Wang Zisheng and others, and also believed that Zhang Baotong was "anti-Party and anti-leadership," and suggested that the superior authorities give him appropriate Party disciplinary action. Such a wrong conclusion, of course, would only encourage bad people and bad deeds and suppress the phenomenon of criticism, and seriously damage the bottom-up criticism.
    Although the nature and extent of the mistakes made by the people involved in this incident are different, there is one thing in common, that is, they all have complacency. It is precisely because of complacency that a Communist Party member developed the despicable bourgeois individualism, embarked on the criminal road of practicing fraud, suppressing democracy, retaliating, and resisting inspection, bringing serious losses to the cause of the Party and the people, and at the same time ruined his glorious political future. It is precisely because of complacency that the relevant superior leading organs and leading cadres lacked a realistic attitude towards the units and cadres under their leadership. When they heard the criticisms and revelations of others, they did not embrace a warm welcome and a bold suspicion, but were preconceived, partial, subjective and arbitrary, and even expressed dissatisfaction with those who upheld justice and adhered to the truth, and carried out rude criticisms. As a result, they打击了正气 (attacked righteousness), promoted evil, and seriously damaged Party unity. The Party organizations at all levels and every Communist Party member should take this lesson to heart, strengthen the political and ideological education of Party cadres, strengthen the Party's leadership over factories and mines, further improve the democratic life within the Party, further strengthen the connection between the Party's leading organs and Party members and the masses, and always pay attention to overcoming complacency.

    骄傲自满的恶果
    最近，中共山西省太原市委员会处理了前太原钢铁厂炼焦部党支部书记王自生等人压制民主、打击报复批评者的事件，王自生被开除出党，其他犯错误的共产党员也分别受到党纪的制裁，因坚持真理、维护党的利益而遭到打击报复的共产党员张宝桐等人受到表扬和鼓励。这个事件暴露了部分党员干部由于骄傲自满而造成的恶果，值得引起全党同志的高度警惕。
    我们党的七届二中全会早已指出，在革命胜利以后要严防骄傲自满情绪的生长，要警惕资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，务必继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的工作作风。全国解放的几年来，在各个岗位上工作的大多数共产党员，按照这个指示，勤勤恳恳地为人民的事业服务，保持和发扬了我们党的优良作风，受到人民群众的热爱和信任，因而也就使我们党在人民群众中享有很高的威信。但是也有不少同志忘记了党的指示，当他们在党的领导和群众的支持之下作出了一些成绩，受到上级的表扬和群众的夸奖之后，就立刻变得狂妄自大起来，把自己领导下的单位变成了“独立王国”，把党和国家交给他们的权力变成了追求名誉地位和满足个人卑鄙欲望的工具。如果有人敢于指责他们的错误，批评他们的缺点，他们便大发雷霆，立刻加以压制和打击报复。太原钢铁厂炼焦部党支部书记王自生，就是在这种情况下走上反党的道路的。这个支部的其他几个共产党员，例如炼焦部的主任史励和支部宣传委员程占海等人，也由于有骄傲情绪和个人主义思想，因而也就跟着王自生一起犯了严重错误。
    在王自生任党支部书记的期间，炼焦部的生产工作的确是有一定成绩的。但是，王自生不是把它归功于党的正确领导，归功于全体职工群众的努力，而是全部挂到自己账上。因此他就骄傲自大起来，他的资产阶级个人主义思想也就随着抬头了。为了进一步表露自己的功绩，骗取所谓“荣誉”，他不惜虚报工作成绩，有意夸大和虚构劳动模范事迹。这就不但掩盖了企业的真实情况，使得党和国家无法实现对企业的正确领导；而且歪曲了党和人民政府的政策，损害了党和人民政府的威信，遭到正直职工和共产党员的坚决反对。当报纸上连续登出有关炼焦部模范事迹的不真实报道以后，许多工人都有意见，表示了他们的不满。炼焦部保卫股长张宝桐及时地把工人的意见反映给党支部和王自生，是为了维护党和人民的利益，也是为了帮助王自生等人认识和改正错误。但是王自生却不仅不接受，反而对张宝桐进行打击报复。
    党经常不断地教导我们：一个人在工作中有时难免不发生一些缺点和错误；但是只要具有严格的批评和自我批评的精神，勇于承认错误和坚决改正错误，而不是想掩盖缺点和错误，那就不但不会失掉党和人民对我们的信任，而且会得到不断的进步和提高，仍然不失为一个好的共产党员和革命工作人员。这个道理很重要，也十分浅显易懂；然而这对于那些被胜利冲昏了头脑因而变得狂妄自大的人和染有浓厚资产阶级个人主义思想的人则是很难接受的。当他们正在狂热地追逐个人的所谓“荣誉”和“地位”，竟至不惜违反党纪国法的时候，要想把他们从危险的道路上拉回来，往往是很困难的。这种人的逻辑同我们完全相反，他们不认为承认并改正缺点和错误是一种好的表现，而是认为会使他们失掉“荣誉”和“地位”，会损害他们的“威信”。所以他们就不把同志的批评当作善意的帮助，反而当成是对自己的攻击。对于提批评意见的人，如果是在他们的管辖之下，他们惯用的方法就是滥用职权，对批评者任意进行反批评，甚至卑鄙到给批评者假造一些罪名，然后施以横蛮的打击和报复。如果提意见的人不在他们的管辖之下，比方说是他们的上级机关派来的干部，他们惯用的方法就是消极对抗，甚至卑鄙到暗中制造和散播不满的舆论，凭空捏造各种事实，进行恶毒的攻击和诋毁，有时还发展到公开抵抗检查。
    王自生等人就是用这种态度来对待群众的批评和上级机关的检查的。在张宝桐向他反映了群众对评议劳动模范的意见以后，他便指派人召开会议，斥责提意见的工人是“把蒸馍当成狗屎”，是“邪气压倒正气”，并且用“要防止坏分子钻空子”来威吓群众；同时还批评张宝桐是“跟着落后群众跑”，诬蔑他是“动机不纯”。当张宝桐没有被恐吓所压倒、向上级机关提出控告之后，王自生就更加恼怒。为了拔掉张宝桐这个“眼中钉”，为了使炼焦部的党和非党群众都不敢和他这个有“成绩”的共产党员作对，他没有放过任何一个机会，不惜采取任何一种卑劣的手段来陷害张宝桐，来诬蔑提意见的工人。王自生等人用这种无中生有、颠倒是非的卑鄙无耻的方法，硬给张宝桐加上了“反党反领导和非组织活动”等重大罪名，几次开会斗争他，逼迫他承认错误，开除了他的党籍，撤消了他的保卫股长职务，并且还要“在党内外肃清张宝桐一类的思想”。在讨论开除张宝桐党籍的党员大会上，王自生等人还吸收了几个对张宝桐有意见的政治品质恶劣的分子参加会议，其中有的还担任小组长领导讨论开除张宝桐党籍的问题。这就说明，为了达到个人的卑鄙目的，王自生已经发展到不择手段，敌我不分的地步了。因为中央重工业部钢铁工业局检查组认真深入了群众、认真按照党的原则来进行了调查研究，因而他们说了真话，王自生等人就把钢铁局检查组也当成眼中钉，对他们也进行恶毒的造谣中伤，给他们加上了“质问劳模，造成混乱，影响生产”等重大罪名，致使他们的检查不能顺利进行。就是这样，王自生便一步一步地走上了反党反人民的罪恶道路。
    王自生等人敢于这样猖狂地压制民主，并且事情发展得越来越严重，是和上级领导机关的某些错误不可分的。在张宝桐等同志提出控告以后，太原钢铁厂党委会作过检查，随后山西省委和太原市委组织了检查组，中央重工业部钢铁工业局也组织了检查组。但是两个检查组的作法是截然相反的。钢铁局检查组实事求是，认真查对事实，依靠工人群众，迅速弄清了事情的真相，始终支持了张宝桐等同志的正确意见。省、市委检查组和太原钢铁厂党委会几个主要负责人的作法就不是这样，他们没有作认真的调查研究，不虚心听取工人的意见，一味地听信炼焦部领导上的歪曲事实的反映。并且省、市委检查组负责人的作风很不民主，检查报告没有经过组内讨论通过，组内有些同志提出的正确意见也没有向省委反映。用这种态度和这种方法作出来的检查报告，当然不会符合事实。这些同志主观武断地认为在他们直接或间接领导下的炼焦部的工作是无可怀疑的，他们已经表扬过的成绩是不会错的，他们已经奖励过的模范也不会假的，他们不愿意去怀疑他们表扬过的事，也不愿意听到谁对他们的表扬提出不同的意见，因而他们不但不相信检举人和工人群众，不支持钢铁局检查组的正确意见，有的人反而跟着王自生等人粗暴地批评钢铁局检查组。
    这些原则性的分歧意见，太原市委和山西省委都是知道的，但是在处理这一事件的时候，省、市委的某些负责同志仍然对自己管辖的工厂可能出现假模范，缺乏应有的警惕，对于张宝桐所揭发的事实和中央钢铁工业局证实假模范的调查，就不相信；对于王自生等人假造的成绩和省、市委检查组否认有假模范的调查，就盲目相信。因此，由市委根据省、市委检查组的报告所作出的，经省委批准的关于太原钢铁厂炼焦部问题的专题报告，虽然指出了炼焦部存在的缺点和错误，要王自生等人检讨，但是对于张宝桐的结论则是完全错误的，基本上是附和了王自生等人的意见，也认为张宝桐是“反党反领导”，并且建议上级给他以适当的党纪处分。这样一个错误的结论，当然只会助长坏人坏事和压制批评的现象，而严重地损害了自下而上的批评。
    这个事件有关的人，所犯错误的性质及其程度虽然有所不同，但是有一点是相同的，那就是他们都存在着骄傲自满情绪。正是由于骄傲自满情绪，使一个共产党员发展了卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义思想，走上了弄虚作假、压制民主、打击报复和抵抗检查的罪恶道路，给党和人民的事业带来严重的损失，同时也就断送了自己的光荣的政治前途。正是由于骄傲自满情绪，就使得有关的上级领导机关和领导干部对待自己领导下的单位和干部缺乏实事求是的态度，听见别人的批评和揭发，不是抱着热烈欢迎和大胆怀疑的态度，而是先入为主，偏听偏信，主观武断，甚至对主持正义、坚持真理的人表示不满，进行粗暴的批评，结果是打击了正气，助长了邪气，并且严重地损害了党内团结。我们党的各级组织和每个共产党员都应该很好地记取这个教训，加强对党员干部的政治思想教育，加强党对厂矿企业的领导，进一步健全党内的民主生活，更加密切党的领导机关和党员、群众的联系，经常注意克服骄傲自满的情绪。
