Farmers in Liaoning Province are actively preparing seeds, draft animals, and farm tools for spring sowing. In Suizhong County, 96 agricultural production cooperatives in the 11th district have selected more than 46,000 jin of seeds. Some farmers in Yi County are conducting germination tests. This year, Heishan County plans to sow 30,000 hectares of cotton. The government plans to distribute 7,500 tons of cotton seeds, and farmers have already hauled back more than 4,300 tons of cotton seeds from the ginneries.

Many farmers in production cooperatives are actively using methods of increasing sideline income to improve spring plowing preparations. According to statistics from 275 cooperatives in Heishan County in February, they have purchased 503 horses, 57 donkeys, and more than 130 carts, and repaired some carts, plows, and tools. The second district of Tai'an County is a disaster area. They have used sideline production to buy back 72 head of livestock and 300,000 jin of fodder. (Our Shenyang reporter)

    辽宁农民积极准备耕畜籽种
    辽宁省各地农民积极准备春播用的籽种和耕畜农具。绥中县十一区九十六个农业生产合作社已选出种籽四万六千多斤，义县有的农民正进行发芽试验，黑山县今年棉花播种计划是三万垧，政府准备发放棉种七千五百吨，农民已从轧花厂拉回棉籽四千三百多吨。
    许多生产合作社的农民积极用增加副业收入的办法来搞好春耕准备工作，据黑山县二百七十五个社二月份统计，他们先后购买了马五百零三匹，驴五十七头，大车一百三十多辆，修理了部分车、犁用具等。台安县二区是个受灾区，他们利用副业生产买回牲口七十二头，草料三十万斤。                 （本报沈阳记者）
