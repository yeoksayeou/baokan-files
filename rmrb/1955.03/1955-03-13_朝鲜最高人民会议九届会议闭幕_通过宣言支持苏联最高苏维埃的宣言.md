According to the report on the implementation of the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made by Minister of Finance Lee Ju-yeon at the meeting on the 9th, the people's economic plan of Korea in 1954—the first year of the three-year plan for the recovery and development of the post-war people's economy—has been successfully completed, the material and cultural life of the people has been improved, and the national budget has been well implemented. Budget revenue was 78,341,361,000 won (Korean currency), while actual revenue was 90,183,880,000 won, completing 115.1 percent of the budget; actual expenditure was 80,640,775,000 won, and the revenue surplus was more than 9.54 billion won.

Based on the results of the implementation of the 1954 People's Economic Plan, the Cabinet of the Republic has decided to complete the Three-Year People's Economic Plan ahead of schedule, and to reach and exceed the level of 1956 (the final year of the Three-Year Plan) in all important sectors of the national economy in 1955.

Lee Ju-yeon's report on the 1955 National Budget stated: Budget revenue is 100,274,625,000 won, expenditure is 96,496,155,000 won, and the surplus is more than 4.7 billion won.

This year's income from state-owned enterprises and national economic institutions increased by 35.2 percent compared to 1954, accounting for 47 percent of budget revenue.

Allocations for the national economy and social and cultural undertakings accounted for 77.9 percent of total budget expenditures, and allocations for the national economy increased by 16.4 percent compared to this aspect in 1954. An important part of the expenditure for the national economy is to provide funds for capital construction, and 45 percent of these funds are used to restore and develop heavy industry.

Lee Ju-yeon said: The successful implementation of the 1955 National Budget is of paramount importance for completing or overfulfilling the 1955 People's Economic Plan. With the material and technical assistance of the people of fraternal countries, the creative labor struggle of the Korean people will surely victoriously implement the 1955 National Budget.
