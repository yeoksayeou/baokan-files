    Overcoming Complacency to Do a Good Job in Grain Delivery
    Toudaogou Village in the Eighteenth District of Dehui County, Jilin Province, was initially a village with faster progress and better completion of grain purchase work in the county. However, the Toudaogou Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party became complacent as a result. Some farmers recognized and sold grain, but were slow to deliver it, and the branch did not educate these farmers. After the Eighteenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Dehui County discovered this problem, it immediately helped the village branch overcome its complacency, commended the party members and cadres who actively delivered grain to the warehouse, and also criticized the party members who were not active in delivering grain. The district committee called on all party members, members of the Communist Youth League, village cadres, and members of the production cooperatives to lead the masses in delivering the remaining grain they had recognized and sold to the national treasury. Party members should also carry out propaganda activities among the masses to make farmers aware of the importance of selling grain, and when delivering grain, they should "finish one household at a time, and one village at a time." After the branch strengthened its leadership in the grain delivery work, the farmers' awareness was raised, and now most of the remaining grain recognized and sold in the village has been delivered to the national treasury.

    克服自满情绪做好送粮工作
    吉林德惠县十八区头道沟村最初是全县购粮工作进展较快，任务完成较好的村。但中共头道沟村支部却因此产生了松劲情绪，有的农民认售了粮食，但迟迟不送，支部对这些农民也不进行教育。中共德惠县十八区区委会发现这个问题以后，立即帮助村支部克服松劲情绪，表扬了积极送粮入库的党员干部同时也批评了不积极送粮的党员。区委会号召所有党员、团员、村干部和生产合作社社员带动群众把认售的余粮送到国库。党员还要在群众中开展宣传活动，使农民认识售粮的重要意义，送粮时要做到“ 送一户完一户，送一屯完一屯”。支部加强了对送粮工作的领导后，农民的觉悟有了提高，现在全村认售的余粮已大部送到国库。
