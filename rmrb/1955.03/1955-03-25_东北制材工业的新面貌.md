The New Look of the Northeast Lumber Industry
Ouyang Yang

Most of the lumber factories in Northeast China are distributed near the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountains forest areas. Over the past few years, they have produced a large amount of construction timber and railway sleepers for the country. If all the timber produced in 1953 and 1954 were converted into sleepers, they could be used to lay three and a half railways from Beijing to Moscow; if all of them were used to build mixed-structure factory buildings, they could build more than 50 million square meters. The lumber industry in Northeast China has developed into a powerful force in national construction.

In the past, the lumber industry in Northeast China had very little mechanical equipment. The limited mechanical equipment was controlled by Japanese capitalists, and the production capacity was very small. In the few years after liberation, with the progress of national construction, the lumber industry in Northeast China generally underwent expansion or reconstruction, established and improved institutions and systems, and added modern and safe mechanical protection equipment, such as automatic sawing machinery, which increased more than six times last year compared with the previous year, and the mechanization and automation of transportation equipment increased more than three times. As a result, heavy physical labor and the occurrence of accidents have been gradually reduced, and labor productivity has been improved. In particular, the equipment utilization rate has increased two to three times compared with the past, and the annual output has increased rapidly.

In 1953, with the help of Soviet experts, the Jiamusi Automated Lumber Factory and the Harbin Xiangfang Comprehensive Wood Processing Factory were built. The equipment in these factories is the most advanced. From raw materials entering the factory, product processing to finished product delivery, all are operated by electric buttons. Universal saws, four-sided planers, mortise machines, herringbone flooring machines, edge trimming machines, and other machines rotate 2,500 to 5,000 revolutions per minute, and a product can be made in a few minutes, fundamentally changing the past handicraft production method of heavy physical labor.

In 1954, the Northeast State-owned Lumber Industry completed 113.68 percent of the state-specified fixed total output value plan, and the hourly production quota per machine exceeded the plan by 6.5 percent. Labor productivity, calculated in kind, exceeded the annual plan by 7.31 percent. Over the past year, workers have proposed 744 rationalization proposals with creative value, of which 469 have been adopted. New mechanized production tools have appeared in every production process, such as circular saw edge trimming machines, small saw automatic planing vehicles, log flipping devices, electric timber transport vehicles, upper edging winches, and rack feeders. The electric timber transport vehicle at the Mudanjiang Lumber Factory used to be operated by three people, and the supply of raw materials was often insufficient. After improving the equipment, one person can operate one unit and drive five electric vehicles. In terms of product calculation, due to the appearance of tools such as "finger gauges," "triangles," and "universal rulers," the work that two people used to do in a day can now be completed by one person in fifty minutes at the Haolianghe Lumber Factory. This saves calculation time and avoids errors.

The products of the Northeast lumber industry supplied the needs of 17 ministries and 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government last year alone. In our steel capital, Anshan, and the construction site of the First Automobile Factory, in the famous Yumen Oilfield, Guanting Reservoir, and Foziling Reservoir, and on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Tianlan Railway, and Jier Railway, Northeast timber products are used. Lumber workers are working hard day and night to contribute to the country's ever-developing construction cause. This year, the state has also decided to build mechanized drying workshops in Suihua, Nancha, Jiamusi, and other places that have never existed before. The lumber industry in Northeast China will continue to develop rapidly in the country's construction.

    东北制材工业的新面貌
    欧阳扬
    东北的制材工厂大多数都分布在小兴安岭和长白山林区附近，几年来，为国家生产了大量的建筑用材和铁路枕木。如果把一九五三年和一九五四年生产的全部木材折算成枕木，可以铺筑三条半从北京到莫斯科的铁路；全部用去建筑混合结构的厂房，可以建筑五千余万平方公尺。东北的制材工业已发展成国家建设中一支强大的力量。
    过去东北制材工业的机械设备是很少的，仅有的机械设备都掌握在日本资本家手里，生产能力很小。解放后的几年中，随着国家建设事业的进展，东北的制材工业普遍进行了扩建或改建，建立和健全了机构、制度，增设了近代的安全的机械防护设备，例如自动的锯木机械装置，去年就比前年增加了六倍多，机械化和自动化的运输设备增加了三倍多。因而逐渐减少了重体力劳动和事故的发生，提高了劳动生产效率，特别是设备利用率比以往提高了两倍到三倍，每年产量迅速提高。
    一九五三年，在苏联专家帮助下，建设了佳木斯自动化制材厂和哈尔滨香坊综合性的木材加工厂。这些工厂的设备都是最先进的。从原料入厂、产品加工到成品出厂，都采用电钮操作。万能锯、四面刨、打眼机、“人”字地板机、切边机等机器每分钟回转二千五百转到五千转，几分钟内就可以做出一个产品，根本改变了过去那种笨重体力劳动的手工业的生产方式。
    一九五四年，东北国营制材工业完成了国家规定的固定总产值计划百分之一百一十三点六八，每台机械小时生产定额超过计划百分之六点五。劳动生产率以实物折算超出年计划百分之七点三一。一年来，工人们提出七百四十四件具有创造价值的合理化建议，经采纳的已有四百六十九件。在每个生产工序中都出现了新的机械化的生产工具，如圆锯切边机，小代锯自动刨车，原木翻楞器，电力运材车，上楞绞盘机，架料机等，牡丹江制材厂电力运材车，过去用三个人操纵，原料还常供不应求，经改进设备后，一个人操纵一台，能够带动五台电车。在产品计算方面，由于出现了“指格针”“三角尺”“万能尺”等工具，平常两个人一天做的工作，浩良河制材厂现在一个人五十分钟就可以完成。节省了计算时间，并避免了错误。
    东北制材工业的产品，仅去年内就供应了国家十七个部，十六个省、自治区和直辖市的需要。在我们的钢都——鞍山和第一汽车厂的工地上，在著名的玉门油矿、官厅水库和佛子岭水库，在武汉长江大桥、天兰铁路和集二线上，都使用着东北的木材产品，制材工人们正日夜辛勤地为国家日益发展的建设事业贡献自己的力量。今年，国家还决定在绥化、南岔、佳木斯等地兴建过去从来没有过的机械化干燥车间，东北的制材工业将在国家建设的突飞猛进中继续发展。
