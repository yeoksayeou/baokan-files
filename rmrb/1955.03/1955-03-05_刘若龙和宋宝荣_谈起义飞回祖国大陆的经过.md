Xinhua News Agency, March 4th:

Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong, former air force personnel of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan who flew back to the mainland on February 23rd, told our reporter about their uprising and the crimes they witnessed of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan.

Liu Ruolong said: "We were deceived into joining the Chiang bandit army in early 1949. In January 1951, after graduating from the Radio Communications Department of the Sergeant Team at the Chiang bandit Navy Soldier School, I was sent to the 'Control and Training Team' at Dabeihu, Fengshan in the Chiang bandit Navy to be 'controlled and trained.' There, I suffered all kinds of physical and mental torture and was forced to join the intelligence group in the Chiang bandit army. Later, I was sent back to the original school to serve as a sergeant instructor. In the Chiang bandit navy, I lived a painful life for more than a year. In July 1952, I left the Chiang bandit navy and was admitted to the Chiang bandit Air Force Officer School. However, the persecution we suffered there was even more severe than in the Chiang bandit navy. In the Chiang bandit Air Force Officer School, each squadron had various open and secret special agent organizations, such as intelligence groups, security groups, and political fighters. If anyone showed the slightest dissatisfaction, they were in danger of being 'eliminated' or arrested at any time. Our 35th class originally had more than 300 students, but after more than two years, only more than 80 were left after being 'eliminated.' Some students disappeared after being 'eliminated.' Because I was a classmate of Hu Hongyi at the Navy Soldier School, after Hu Hongyi's uprising, I was summoned to the security section or the instructor's office in the middle of the night for interrogation for more than ten consecutive days and was forbidden to fly."

Song Baorong said: "The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique treats Chinese people with cruelty and ferocity, but is extremely servile to Americans. Good sanatoriums, houses, mines, and factories in Taiwan have been occupied by the United States. Americans do whatever they want on Chinese soil and insult Chinese people at will. Once, a so-called embassy attaché from the United States stationed in Taiwan went to the Air Force Officer School for a tour. Liu Ruolong did not salute him on the road, and the pseudo-principal was immediately reprimanded for this. For this reason, the Chiang bandit school authorities also forced students to learn so-called American rank identification. This shameless behavior angered every student whose national self-esteem had not been completely obliterated.” He said, “The victories of the People's Liberation Army in the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang in the past six months and the announcement of the policies and reward measures for officers and soldiers of the Chiang army who revolt and surrender, promulgated by the Ministry of National Defense, have further strengthened our determination to fly to the light.”

Song Baorong said: "Since the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan by all democratic parties and people's organizations across the country was transmitted to Taiwan, many people have been looking forward to the People's Liberation Army liberating Taiwan as soon as possible. Although the Chiang bandit special agent organizations have particularly strengthened surveillance, and various propaganda organs have boasted about their so-called victories in the Fujian coastal area and the Dachen sea, in an attempt to maintain their even lower morale, Taiwan has become more and more panicked. Even many Chiang bandit officers and soldiers are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army liberating Taiwan, so that they can escape the sea of misery and reunite with their families. Prices in Taiwan have also risen again and again. Especially after the news of the liberation of Yijiangshan Island and Dachen, Pishan, Yushan and other islands reached Taiwan, prices in Taiwan rose even faster. Although many Chiang bandit officials are boasting everywhere 'We have the protection of the US Seventh Fleet, don't be afraid,' etc., they themselves are secretly transferring the property they have plundered to foreign countries and moving their families to the countryside. As a result, real estate and rents in rural areas have suddenly increased several times. The Chiang bandit air defense command organs, which are shouting 'calm' every day, often issue alarms regardless of whose plane it is as soon as they hear the sound of the plane, and sometimes even fire anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. Once, they even mistakenly shot down their own plane. A flying instructor in the Chiang bandit Air Force Officer School, hearing the alarm, turned pale with fright and quickly ran to the air-raid shelter. All of these scenes made us have to consider our own future: Should we stay in Taiwan and serve as cannon fodder for American robbers and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek traitors, or should we revolt and fly back to the motherland as soon as possible? We chose the bright road. On February 23rd, we disregarded all dangers, and flew back to the mainland of the motherland in a primary trainer aircraft."

    谈起义飞回祖国大陆的经过
    【新华社四日讯】　在二月二十三日驾飞机起义飞回祖国大陆的台湾蒋军空军人员刘若龙、宋宝荣向本社记者讲述了他们起义的经过和他们目睹的蒋介石卖国集团在台湾的罪行。
    刘若龙说：“我们是在一九四九年初被骗参加蒋贼军的。一九五一年一月，我刚在蒋贼海军士兵学校军士队无线电通讯科毕业，就被送到蒋贼海军凤山大碑湖‘管训队’去受‘管训’。在那里，我受尽了肉体上、精神上的种种折磨，被迫参加了蒋贼军中的情报小组。以后，我仍被送回原校去当下士助教。在蒋贼海军中，我过了一年多痛苦的生活。一九五二年七月我离开了蒋贼海军，考入蒋贼空军军官学校。但是，在那里我们所受到的迫害比在蒋贼海军时更厉害。在蒋贼空军军官学校里，每个中队中都设有情报小组、保防小组和政治战士等各种公开的和秘密的特务组织。人们只要稍露不满，随时有被‘淘汰’或被逮捕的危险。我们第三十五期原来有三百多名学生，过了两年多，就被‘淘汰’得只剩下八十多人。有些同学被‘淘汰’后下落不明。我也曾因为与胡弘一是海军士兵学校的同学，在胡弘一起义后，接连十多天，在半夜被喊到保防科或指导员那里去受审问，并被禁止飞行。”
    宋宝荣说：“蒋介石卖国集团对待中国人残暴凶恶，对待美国人却极尽其奴颜婢膝的能事。台湾好的休养所、房屋、矿产、工厂都被美国侵占。美国人在中国土地上为所欲为，随意侮辱中国人。有一次，有个美国驻台湾的所谓大使馆的随从武官跑到空军军官学校来游逛，在路上刘若龙没有向他敬礼，伪校长马上就因此受到训斥。为此，蒋贼学校当局还强迫学生举行了所谓美国官阶识别的学习。这种丧尽廉耻的行为，使每个民族自尊心还未完全泯灭的同学，无不愤怒。”他说：“人民解放军近半年来在闽浙沿海的胜利和国防部颁布的对蒋军起义、投诚人员的政策和奖励办法的通告，进一步加强了我们要飞向光明的决心。”
    宋宝荣说：“自从全国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言传到台湾后，许多人都盼望着人民解放军早日解放台湾。尽管蒋贼特务组织特别加强监视，各种宣传机关也大吹其所谓福建沿海和大陈海面的胜利，妄图维持其更加低落的士气，但是台湾却越来越慌乱了。连许多蒋贼军官兵也盼望人民解放军解放台湾，好脱离苦海与家人团圆。台湾物价也一次又一次地高涨。特别是最近一江山岛和大陈、披山、渔山等岛屿解放的消息传到台湾后，台湾物价更是涨的飞快。许多蒋贼官员虽然到处吹嘘‘我们有美国第七舰队的保护，不要怕’等等，但是他们自己却在暗中把搜刮来的财产转移到外国去，把家眷搬到乡下。农村中的房地产和房租因此都突然高涨数倍。天天叫嚷‘镇静’的蒋贼防空指挥机关，一听到飞机声，往往不管是谁的飞机就乱发警报，有时还乱打高射炮。有一次甚至于错打了他们自己的飞机。蒋贼空军军官学校中有个飞行教官，听到警报，吓得面色如土，赶快往防空洞中跑。这一切景象，使我们不得不考虑到自己的前途：留在台湾为美国强盗及其走狗蒋介石卖国贼当炮灰呢，还是及早起义飞回祖国？我们选择了光明大路。在二月二十三日，我们不顾一切危险，驾驶一架初级教练机，飞回祖国大陆。”
