    Do a Good Job in Repaying the Principal and Interest of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds

    The People's Victory Indexed Bonds issued by the state in 1950 have reached their final redemption period. The Ministry of Finance issued an announcement on February 28th: All bond certificates that have not been drawn in previous lotteries, or those that have been drawn but the principal and interest have not yet been collected, can be cashed at the bank from March 31st to March 31st next year.
    The People's Victory Indexed Bonds issued in 1950 played a certain positive role in absorbing idle funds, stabilizing financial prices, and making up for financial deficits at that time. This was conducive to the recovery and development of the national economy. Everyone who purchased the bonds gave direct support to the recovery and development of the national economy and made contributions to the country. This is a manifestation of patriotism. On the other hand, the state also tried its best to take care of the interests of each bond purchaser. When the bonds were issued in 1950, because prices had not yet been completely stabilized, an indexed method was adopted at that time, with an annual interest rate of five percent. In addition, it was stipulated that bond interest would be exempt from interest income tax and other measures beneficial to the people. These methods fully demonstrate that the bonds issued by the People's Government are completely responsible to the people, and therefore, the bonds issued by the People's Government have established a good reputation among the people of the whole country.
    In the past five years, China's construction undertakings in various fields have developed rapidly, and people's lives have gradually improved. Under this new situation, the State Council decided to continue to issue the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds on the basis of the successful completion of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. This is a matter of great significance for the great cause of China's socialist industrialization. Because the bonds issued in the past have established a solid reputation among the people, and because the people of the whole country have studied the general line, the victory of socialism has become the common aspiration of the people of the whole country. Everyone is willing to strive for this great goal, first of all, for the realization of the first five-year plan. Therefore, the people of the whole country are also very enthusiastic about purchasing the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds.
    Now, most provinces and cities will fully launch the sales of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds starting in March. The state's measures for the full repayment of the principal and interest of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds will further encourage people's enthusiasm for purchasing the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. Therefore, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of the holders of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, and in order to further enable the people to understand the state's bond policy, in addition to the local People's Banks earnestly striving to do a good job in the repayment and cashing work, all localities and all sectors across the country should also publicize the redemption methods stipulated by the government to bondholders, receive the principal and interest on time, and further publicize to the whole people the great significance of the state's issuance of bonds for economic construction, and the full care for the rights and interests of bondholders, explaining the consistency of individual interests and national interests, so that the people of the whole country can more actively and enthusiastically welcome the high tide of purchasing the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds!

    做好人民胜利折实公债还本付息的工作
    蔡平
    一九五○年国家发行的人民胜利折实公债已到最后一次的还本期了。财政部在二月二十八日发出了公告：凡历次未中签的公债券，或中签而尚未领取本息的公债券，自三月三十一日起至明年三月三十一日止，都可向银行兑付本金和利息。
    一九五○年发行的人民胜利折实公债，在当时，对吸收游资、稳定金融物价、弥补财政赤字都起了一定的积极作用，这是有利于国民经济事业的恢复和发展的，每一个购买公债的人，对国民经济事业的恢复和发展都给予了直接支援，对国家都有贡献，这是爱国主义精神的表现。另一方面，国家也尽量照顾了每个购买公债人的利益。一九五○年发行公债时，由于物价尚未完全稳定，当时采取了折实的办法，年息五厘，此外，还规定公债利息免纳利息所得税等等有利人民的办法。这些办法充分说明了人民政府发行的公债是完全对人民认真负责的，因而也就使人民政府发行的公债在全国人民中建立了良好的信誉。
    五年来，我国各方面的建设事业都有飞跃的发展，人民生活逐步得到改善，在这一新的情况下，国务院决定在一九五四年国家经济建设公债胜利完成的基础上，继续发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债。这是对我国社会主义工业化的伟大事业有重大意义的一件事情。由于各次发行的公债已在人民中树立了稳固的信誉，又由于全国人民学习了总路线，社会主义的胜利成为全国人民的共同愿望，大家都愿为这一伟大目标、首先是为着第一个五年计划的实现而奋斗。因此全国人民认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债，也是很踊跃的。
    现在，大部分省、市，自三月份起，将要全面展开一九五五年国家经济建设公债的推销工作。而国家对于一九五○年人民胜利折实公债全部还本付息的措施，会更加鼓舞起人们踊跃认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债的热情。所以，为了维护持有人民胜利折实公债债券人的权益，为了使人民进一步认识国家的公债政策，除了各地人民银行认真努力做好还本付息的兑付工作外，全国各地、各界还应该向持券人宣传政府规定的兑付办法，按期领取本金和利息，并向全体人民进一步宣传国家发行公债对经济建设的重大意义，和对持券人的权益的充分照顾，说明个人利益和国家利益的一致性，使全国人民更加积极地、踊跃地迎接认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债的高潮！
