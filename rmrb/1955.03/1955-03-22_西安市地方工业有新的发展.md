    Xi'an's local industry will build and renovate a number of factories serving key construction projects this year. These factories are now in the preparatory stages of construction, and most will strive to be completed within the year. After the new oxygen plant is completed, its annual oxygen production will basically guarantee the needs of the city's key construction projects. After the renovation of Xi'an No. 1 Brick and Tile Factory, its production capacity will be greatly improved, and it will supply nearly 100,000 meters of cement pipes for key construction projects this year.
    In addition, the Shaanxi Provincial Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory and the Lianhuasi Crushed Stone Factory, which were newly built and renovated in the Xi'an area last year, are also actively carrying out the final stages of construction, striving to be completed and put into production in the first and second quarters of this year. Among them, the newly built Shaanxi Provincial Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory will produce 12 million mechanized bricks and tiles this year; the Lianhuasi Crushed Stone Factory will also increase the production of 200,000 cubic meters of crushed stone.

    西安市地方工业有新的发展
    西安市地方工业今年将新建和改建一批为重点建设服务的工厂。这些工厂现在都在进行建设的准备工作，大部分将争取在年内完工。新建氧气厂建成后，每年生产的氧气基本上可保证全市重点建设的需要。西安第一砖瓦厂经过改建后，生产能力将大大提高，今年将以近十万公尺的水泥管供应重点建设工程。
    此外，去年西安地区新建和改建的陕西省机制砖瓦厂和莲花寺石碴厂等，也正在积极进行工程结尾工作，争取在今年第一、二季度完工并投入生产。其中新建的陕西省机制砖瓦厂建成后，今年将生产一千二百万块机制砖瓦；莲花寺石碴厂也将增产二十万立方公尺的石碴。
