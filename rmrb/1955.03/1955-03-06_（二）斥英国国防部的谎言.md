(II) Refuting the Lies of the British Ministry of Defence

    On February 27th, the British Ministry of Defence released an official report purportedly concerning the treatment of British prisoners of war during the Korean War. The entire report is composed of baseless, completely fabricated, and preposterous lies. None of the "examples" cited in the report include specific times, places, and names. After all, rumor-mongers and liars have guilty consciences, knowing that their fabricated lies cannot withstand scrutiny and will be exposed with a single poke. This clumsy report, completely constructed of lies, is not even worth refuting.

    The humanitarian policies of the Korean and Chinese side towards prisoners of war and the facts of their lenient treatment have long been known to the people of the world. The healthy condition of the repatriated prisoners of war from the United Nations forces, including British prisoners of war, upon their return, and their heartfelt expressions of gratitude for the leniency shown to them by the Korean and Chinese side, fully demonstrate the truth and refute all slanders and smears. The American authorities have tried more than once to slander the Korean and Chinese side for "mistreating" prisoners of war through lies and rumors, but each time they have only failed in the face of ironclad facts, further exposing their despicable and shameful nature. Today, the British Ministry of Defence suddenly trots out a pile of preposterous fabricated lies in an attempt to confuse the world's people, slander the Korean and Chinese side, which is not only clumsy but also futile.

    In fact, what is well-known to the people of the world and has been met with angry condemnation is the fact that the United Nations forces, with British troops participating as members, used savage and cruel methods to persecute and massacre prisoners of war on a large scale.

    The United Nations forces began massacring prisoners of war and captured wounded soldiers on the battlefield. On September 15th and November 6th, 1950, they successively massacred large numbers of prisoners of war at the Inchon wharf and on the Hagaru-ri road. On May 27th, 1951, they massacred a large number of captured wounded soldiers in a field hospital in the Inje area. These are just a few examples of countless such cruel incidents.

    The bloody incidents of large-scale massacre of prisoners of war at the Koje Island and Pongam Island prisoner-of-war camps shocked the whole world. The British Ministry of Defence must clearly remember that British Commonwealth forces were specifically sent to the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp to participate in that appalling and barbaric massacre. In the prisoner-of-war camps, the United Nations forces frequently used weapons such as bayonets, automatic rifles, carbines, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, 60mm mortars, grenades, gas bombs, flamethrowers, armored vehicles, and tanks, as well as cruel methods of killing such as burning alive, "shooting at live targets," burying alive, ripping out hearts, and strangling to carry out individual killings and massacres of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. According to preliminary materials already uncovered by the Korean and Chinese side, more than 33,600 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and more than 2,600 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were killed by the United Nations forces.

    In addition to brutal killings, the United Nations forces consistently carried out illegal interrogations and various tortures on prisoners of war. Taking the 511 prisoners of war repatriated from the "F" compound of the 8th Prisoner-of-War Camp on Jeju Island as an example, all of them had been subjected to illegal interrogations, and more than 86 percent of them had been tortured.

    There is ample evidence to confirm that the United Nations forces subjected prisoners of war to mistreatment in living conditions, mental abuse, forced illegal labor, illegal punishment, forced recruitment as spies, and using prisoners of war for medical and weapons performance experiments. All kinds of tragic and cruel situations fully confirm that the prisoner-of-war camps of the United Nations forces were truly dark hells on earth!

    It is impossible to list all the facts here. The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea and the Red Cross Society of China conducted investigations into the treatment of captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side by the United Nations forces and submitted investigation reports in December 1953, respectively. These two investigation reports listed countless concrete facts, fully confirming the crimes of the United Nations forces in mistreating, persecuting, and massacring prisoners of war. The United Nations forces must inescapably bear responsibility for these crimes.

    The United Nations forces, with British troops participating as members, not only mistreated, persecuted, and massacred captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side, but also violated the Geneva Convention and the Korean Armistice Agreement, deprived prisoners of war of their right to return home and live peaceful lives, and forcibly detained a large number of captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side. The United Nations forces bear inescapable responsibility for this serious crime.

    Now, the British Ministry of Defence has suddenly had a whimsical idea, fabricated out of thin air, and released this slanderous report, obviously with ulterior motives, attempting to confuse the public, deceive the people, and step up coordination with the war policy of the American aggressive bloc to create a tense situation. However, the eyes of the people are discerning. What the British people should be investigating is what benefits this policy of blindly following the United States can bring to Britain.

### （二）斥英国国防部的谎言

    （二）斥英国国防部的谎言
    英国国防部在二月二十七日发表了一个据称是关于朝鲜战争中英国战俘所受待遇情况的官方报告。整个报告是由毫无根据、完全捏造的荒诞的谎言构成的。报告中所举的“例子”没有一个有具体的时间、地点和人名，毕竟造谣说谎者心虚，自知那些捏造的谎言经不起追究，一戳就穿的。这个完全由谎言构成的拙劣的报告根本不值一驳。
    朝中方面对于战俘的人道主义的政策和宽待战俘的事实早已为世界人民所共知。那些遣返回去的联合国军方面的战俘，包括英国战俘在内，在遣返时的健康的身体和他们对于朝中方面对他们的宽待的衷心感谢的表示，充分说明了事实的真象，驳倒了一切的诽谤和诬蔑。美国官方早已不止一次地企图用说谎造谣来诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘，但每一次都只有在铁的事实面前失败，反而更加进一步暴露了它的卑鄙可耻。今天英国国防部忽然搬出一大堆荒诞的捏造谎言，企图混淆世界人民视听，诬蔑朝中方面，不仅笨拙，而且是徒劳。
    事实上，为全世界人民所熟知而且遭到全世界人民的愤怒的谴责的，是有英国部队参加作为成员之一的联合国军方面采用了野蛮残酷的手段大规模地迫害、虐杀战俘。
    联合国军在战场上就开始屠杀战俘和被俘伤员。在一九五○年九月十五日和十一月六日他们先后在仁川码头和下碣隅里公路上屠杀大批战俘。一九五一年五月二十七日在麟蹄地区他们屠杀了战地医院中被俘的大批伤员。这些只是无数这类残酷的事件中的几个例子。
    巨济岛、蜂岩岛战俘营的大规模屠杀战俘的血腥事件曾经震撼了全世界。英国国防部一定清楚地记得英联邦部队还特地被派到巨济岛战俘营去参与那场骇人听闻的野蛮的大屠杀。在战俘营里，联合国军经常使用刺刀、自动步枪、卡宾枪、轻机关枪、重机关枪、六○炮、手榴弹、毒气弹、火焰喷射器、装甲车、坦克等武器及火烧、“打活靶”、活埋、挖心、勒死等等残暴的杀害方法对朝中战俘进行个别杀害和集体屠杀。根据朝中方面现已查获的初步材料，遭联合国军杀害的朝鲜人民军被俘人员达三万三千六百多人，中国人民志愿军被俘人员达二千六百多人。
    联合国军方面对于战俘，除残暴的杀害以外，还一贯实行非法审讯和各种酷刑，仅以从济州岛第八号战俘营“F”号营场遣返回来的五百一十一名战俘为例，他们全部都受过非法审讯，被用过刑的占百分之八十六以上。
    有充分的材料证实联合国军方面对于战俘的生活虐待、精神虐待、强迫非法劳动、非法处罚、强迫充当特务、拿战俘供医学和武器性能的试验。种种悲惨残酷的情况完全证实了联合国军方面的战俘营真正是黑暗的人间地狱！
    这里不可能一一列举事实。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会和中国红十字会曾就联合国军方面对待朝中被俘人员的情形进行了调查，并在一九五三年十二月分别提出了调查报告。这两个调查报告列举了无数的具体事实，完全证实了联合国军方面虐待、迫害和屠杀战俘的罪行。联合国军是无可逃避地必须对这些罪行负责的。
    有英国部队参加作为成员之一的联合国军不仅虐待、迫害和屠杀朝中方面被俘人员，而且还违反日内瓦公约和朝鲜停战协定、剥夺战俘遣返回家过和平生活的权利，强迫扣留了大批朝中被俘人员。联合国军方面对于这一严重的罪行，负有不可逃避的责任。
    现在，英国国防部忽然异想天开，凭空捏造，发表这一个诬蔑性的报告，显然是别有用心，企图混淆视听、欺骗人民，加紧配合美国侵略集团的战争政策，制造紧张局势。但是，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，英国人民要追究的倒是这种亦步亦趋追随美国的政策究竟能替英国带来什么好处。
