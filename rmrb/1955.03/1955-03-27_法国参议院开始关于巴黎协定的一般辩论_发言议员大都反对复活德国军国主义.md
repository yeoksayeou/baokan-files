Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the 24th, the French Senate began a general debate on the Paris Agreements. The debate revealed that only a minority of senators unconditionally support the Paris Agreements.

    At the start of the morning session, Jean Chaintrand, representing the Communist group in the Senate, introduced a "preliminary motion." This motion stated: "In view of the current international situation and considering the content of the various clauses of the Paris Agreements, the Senate refuses to support the proposal to ratify the Paris Agreements and instructs the French government to take immediate necessary measures to hold Four-Power talks on the German question and European collective security." According to the rules of procedure of the Senate, this motion should be voted on before the Paris Agreements are discussed clause by clause.

    Yves Chapelain of the "Social Republicans" spoke, calling on everyone to reject the Paris Agreements and the arming of West Germany. He emphasized: "All the diplomatic rhetoric attempting to justify the Paris Agreements cannot hide the fact that the Paris Agreements do not provide sufficient guarantees for the security of France."

    Yvon Goudou Dufflessto of the People's Republican Party acknowledged the shortcomings of the Paris Agreements in his speech, but still expressed his intention to vote in favor.

    In the afternoon session, Raymond Lanchard of the Independent Republicans pointed out in his speech that the Paris Agreements have caused great unease among people from all walks of life in France, and Prime Minister Faure's arguments cannot dispel this anxiety.

    Lanchard said, to the applause of some senators, "The arming of West Germany must be rejected. If we do not do so, our sacrifices in the two world wars will have been in vain. I value the dignity of the motherland, and therefore I loudly proclaim: Do not arm West Germany."

    Lanchard's speech moved the participants of the meeting. Prime Minister Edgar Faure, who had originally planned to speak at the end of the debate, immediately rose to respond. He firmly advocated for the immediate ratification of the Paris Agreements, stubbornly claiming that France's agreement to revive the German "Bundeswehr" was a "realistic policy" to promote "Franco-German reconciliation." Faure also hinted that if the Senate refused to ratify the Paris Agreements, it would trigger a new government crisis.

    Pierre Massiasse of the Independent Republicans spoke out against the claim that rejecting the Paris Agreements would worsen France's international standing. He said: "In the past decade, we have not acted alone, yet we have still created a very difficult situation for ourselves in the Near East; in the Far East, our interests have also been harmed. Our position in North Africa is threatened. Our relations with our allies are not always the best. I do not believe that these situations will improve after the Paris Agreements are ratified."

    Some speeches in the evening session showed the complex situation within some factions of the Senate. Socialist member Môdet attempted to justify the decision of the majority of his faction to vote in favor of ratification.

    Ponton of the Left-Wing Union said: The Paris Agreements in their current form cannot provide France with "serious guarantees." He advocated for the adoption of an appropriate amendment, declaring that a postponement of ratification "would clarify the international situation."

    Charles Moret of the Farmers' Party doubted the necessity of ratifying the Paris Agreements and stated that he would not vote in favor.

    The last person to speak at the evening session on the 24th was Antoine Colonnet, representing the French colonial group in Tunisia, who supported the unconditional ratification of these agreements.

    On the 25th, the French Senate continued its debate on the Paris Agreements. Twenty-five people were registered to speak.

    General Betti's speech aroused great interest among everyone. He said that the plan to arm West Germany was an insult to the memory of the victims of German militarism. He pointed out that the Paris Agreements would push France onto the path of an arms race and preparation for atomic war, and would violate the Franco-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-British Treaty. General Betti said that the majority of the French people hoped that the Senate would reject the Paris Agreements.

    Aubert of the Socialist Party also emphasized the great threat posed to France by the Paris Agreements, which did not provide any real guarantees for French security. He pointed out that many people in France, regardless of any threats, did not want to establish a German "Bundeswehr," nor an arms race, nor to participate in the "crusade" promoted by the United States. Aubert pledged to do everything possible to oppose the revival of the German "Bundeswehr" and strive for French national independence.

    Aubert's speech showed that the attempt by Socialist leader Mollet to force all Socialist senators to vote in favor of the Paris military agreements was being defeated.

    Communist Belliot spoke. He said that everyone who voted in favor of the Paris Agreements was violating the will of the people. He pointed out that "Franco-German reconciliation" could not be achieved within a military bloc. The Soviet government has repeatedly put forward proposals aimed at strengthening peace, and these proposals are fully in line with the wishes of the French people.

    Debré-Brider of the Social Republicans demanded that great power talks be held on the German question before the Paris Agreements were ratified.

    Foreign Minister Pinay rose to refute this, saying that France could not initiate such talks separately from its allies.

    Debré-Brider asked loudly: "Is France no longer an independent country capable of taking independent action on the international stage?"

    After a short interruption, Pinay began to speak again, demanding that the Senate ratify the Paris Agreements "without any conditions, amendments, or delays, with a clear and affirmative vote."

    Socialist members Barr, Chassette, and other members also used various tricks to promote the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    The debate continued late into the night.

### 法国参议院开始关于巴黎协定的一般辩论  发言议员大都反对复活德国军国主义

    法国参议院开始关于巴黎协定的一般辩论
    发言议员大都反对复活德国军国主义
    据新华社讯：二十四日，法国共和国参议院开始关于巴黎协定的一般辩论。辩论的情况表明：参议院中只有少数议员无条件地赞成巴黎协定。
    上午会议开始时，让·香特朗代表共和国参议院共产党党团提出了一个“先决动议”。这个动议说：“鉴于目前的国际情势，并且考虑到巴黎协定各项条款的内容，共和国参议院拒绝主张批准巴黎协定的提案，并且责成法国政府立即采取必要的措施，以便就德国问题和欧洲集体安全问题举行四大国会谈。”根据共和国参议院议事规则，这个动议应当在逐条讨论巴黎协定之前进行表决。
    “社会共和党人”伊夫·夏贝兰发言，号召大家拒绝巴黎协定和武装西德。他强调指出：“企图为巴黎协定辩解的一切外交辞令都不能掩盖这个事实：巴黎协定对法国的安全没有提供足够的保证。”
    人民共和党人伊冯·古德杜弗莱斯托在发言中承认巴黎协定有缺点，但是仍然表示要投赞成票。
    在下午会议上，独立共和党的雷蒙·朗夏尔在发言中指出：巴黎协定引起法国社会各界人士极大的不安，而富尔总理的论点并不能消除这种忧虑情绪。
    朗夏尔在共和国参议院中一部分议员的鼓掌声中说：“必须拒绝武装西德。如果我们不这样做，我们在两次世界大战中就徒然受到了牺牲。我很重视祖国的尊严，因此大声疾呼：不要武装西德。”
    朗夏尔的发言打动了会议的参加者。原先打算在辩论结束时才发言的埃加·富尔总理立刻起来作答复。他坚决主张立即批准巴黎协定，硬说法国同意复活德国“国防军”是一个促进“法德和好”的“现实政策”。富尔还暗示，如果共和国参议院拒绝批准巴黎协定，就会引起新的政府危机。
    独立共和党皮埃尔·马西阿西发言驳斥所谓拒绝巴黎协定就要使法国的国际地位恶化的说法。他说：“在过去十年中，我们并没有单干，然而在近东仍然造成了对我们十分困难的形势；在远东，我们的利益也受到损害。我们在北非的地位受到威胁。我们同盟国的关系并不总是顶好的。我不认为，在批准巴黎协定之后，这些情况会改善。”
    在晚间会议上的一些发言显示出共和国参议院中一些党团内部的复杂情况。社会党议员莫戴设法为决定投票赞成批准的他的党团的多数成员辩解。
    左翼联盟的庞东说：目前形式的巴黎协定是不能为法国提供“认真的保证”的。他主张采纳一个适当的修正案，宣布延期批准“会澄清国际局势”。
    农民党人夏尔·摩雷怀疑有必要批准巴黎协定，并且表示他不会投赞成票。
    在二十四日晚间会议上最后发言的人是代表突尼斯的法国殖民集团的安托万·戈隆纳，他赞成无条件批准这些协定。
    二十五日，法国共和国参议院继续进行关于巴黎协定的辩论。登记发言的有二十五人。
  　柏蒂将军的发言引起了大家很大的兴趣。他说，武装西德的计划对德国军国主义受害者的纪念是一种侮辱。他指出：巴黎协定会把法国推上军备竞赛和准备原子战争的道路，并且违反了法苏条约和法英条约。柏蒂将军说：大多数法国人民都希望共和国参议院拒绝巴黎协定。
    社会党的奥伯也着重指出这个没有对法国的安全规定任何真正保证的巴黎协定对法国的巨大威胁。他指出，法国有许多人不顾一切威胁，既不要建立德国“国防军”，也不要军备竞赛，不要参加美国所宣传的“十字军”。奥伯保证要尽一切力量来反对德国“国防军”的复活和争取法国的民族独立。
    奥伯的发言表明：社会党领袖摩勒要迫使参议院的所有社会党议员投票赞成巴黎军事协定的企图正在遭到失败。
    共产党人贝利奥兹发言。他说：每一个投票赞成巴黎协定的人都是违反人民的意志的。他指出在一个军事集团之内不可能实现“法德和解”。苏联政府屡次提出了目的在于加强和平的建议，这些建议是完全符合法国人民的愿望的。
    社会共和党人德布—布里德要求在批准巴黎协定之前就德国问题举行大国会谈。
    外交部长比内起来反驳，他说：法国不能撇开自己的盟友而单独倡议召开这样的会谈。
    德布—布里德大声反问道：“难道法国不再是一个能够在国际舞台上采取单独行动的独立国家吗？”
    在稍稍中断之后，比内又开始讲话，他要求共和国参议院“没有任何条件、修正和拖延，以明确、肯定的表决”来批准巴黎协定。
    社会党人巴尔、夏赛特以及其他一些议员也使用了种种诡计，来鼓吹批准巴黎协定。
    辩论一直进行到深夜。
