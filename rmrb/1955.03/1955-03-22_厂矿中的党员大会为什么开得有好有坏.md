Why Are Party Member Congresses in Factories and Mines Sometimes Good and Sometimes Bad?
Song Zheng

The main task of Party organizations in factories and mining enterprises is to guarantee and supervise production. Party member congresses in factories and mining enterprises should frequently discuss major issues related to production. Currently, most Party organizations in factories and mining enterprises have paid attention to this issue. However, because the discussion methods differ, different results have been obtained. Here is a good example:

In the spring of 1954, a serious quality accident occurred in the boiler workshop of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant. The boiler patch panels needed to be reworked, resulting in significant losses. The Boiler Workshop Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party raised this issue for discussion at the Party member congress. The branch committee designated someone to report to the congress. The reporter gave everyone a detailed account, pointing out that the losses from the rework of the patch panels totaled more than 180 million yuan (old currency). It also affected the planned delivery of three locomotives, depriving the units that needed them. A large number of workers in the workshop were engaged in repairs, disrupting the normal production plan and affecting the production of the following month. The report pointed out: In order to implement the Party's general line during the transition period and realize the country's socialist industrialization, existing factories and mines should practice strict economy and accumulate more funds for the country; they should complete their plans on time and continuously supply the country with new machinery and equipment. However, the rework of the patch panels wasted a large amount of the country's funds and failed to supply the country with new equipment according to plan. Based on the branch's investigation and research, the reporter analyzed the causes of the quality accident. On the one hand, some cadres and workers did not have a strong sense of responsibility for product quality, so that some responsibility systems related to ensuring quality were not well implemented. On the other hand, there was a sense of pride among the workers. Everyone felt that they had done this kind of work before and there had been no problems, and the quality was not bad, so they became careless. Based on the branch's report, all Party members seriously discussed this issue. Everyone first criticized the branch, "When there is no quality problem, the branch does not supervise product quality; when a problem occurs, the branch becomes flustered and busy, holding meetings and making criticisms." Everyone also criticized the administrative leaders for only urging progress and not caring about the quality; they also criticized the trade union for not doing a good job in promoting advanced experience. Everyone criticized those responsible for the quality accident, and also conducted self-criticism. Some people revealed that some groups did not comply with operating procedures, and some criticized some Party members for not paying attention to quality.

The effect of this Party member congress was very good. Originally, the branch only vaguely felt that the work of ensuring quality was not done well. After the criticism of the Party members, the branch realized that in terms of ensuring quality, the branch's work was passive, rushed, lacked foresight, and did not regularly educate Party members on the importance of quality, and fight against all ideas that ignored quality. After this meeting, the branch regularly paid attention to educating Party members and non-Party workers on the importance of quality, and publicizing advanced figures and advanced ideas who attached importance to quality. Party members and workers had a correct understanding of product quality, and were more serious in implementing regulations and systems than in the past. The branch also helped the trade union improve the work of promoting advanced experience. The administrative leaders also rectified and improved various responsibility systems related to ensuring quality according to the resolution of the Party member congress, and, together with the trade union, formulated operating procedures for the patch panels and held a technical observation meeting for the patch panels.

Still the Boiler Workshop Branch, a Party member congress held in July 1954 did not go well. This congress discussed the issue of implementing work plans. At the Party member congress, the branch made a report to everyone on the implementation of work plans, talking in detail about how to compile work plans, how to issue work plans, and how to conduct scheduling, etc. In the report, the branch also specifically introduced the experience of the large furnace team in promoting shift work plans. However, only a few administrative management cadres spoke at the congress, and most Party members did not understand the content of the report, so they could only say: "The experience of the large furnace team is very good, we will learn from it in the future." Although this congress played a role to some extent, the work plan was not implemented smoothly. The team leader and the administrative group leader (mostly Party members) were unwilling to implement the shift work plan. They said that there was no difference whether or not there was a shift work plan.

Quality problems are major problems in production, and implementing work plans is also a major problem in production. However, why was one congress very successful and the other congress a failure? What is the problem? The problem is that in the Party member congress that discussed the quality problem of patch panels, the branch's report was a report with relatively ideological content (although the self-criticism spirit of this report was not enough). Doing work badly and reworking it was originally a common thing that everyone did not think was serious, but the branch changed everyone's common perception through specific analysis, and linked product quality with the implementation of the Party's general line and the realization of the country's socialist industrialization, which stimulated everyone's high sense of responsibility for product quality. When analyzing the causes of the quality accident, the report focused on pointing out the problems existing in the ideological style of the workers, and guided everyone to expose and criticize the erroneous understanding and attitude of leading cadres and workers towards quality problems. Although this Party member congress did not organize everyone to specifically solve the problems in management and technology, because everyone had recognized the significance of the product quality problem, they were able to consciously work hard to solve those problems that they should solve according to the resolution of the congress.

The situation of the Party member congress that discussed the work plan was completely different. This meeting was actually a repetition of the administrative meeting. The branch did not politically explain the significance of promoting the shift work plan, and stimulate everyone's enthusiasm and determination to overcome difficulties and seriously learn this advanced management method. The branch also did not analyze what difficulties would be encountered in promoting the work plan, especially the various ideological obstacles that might be encountered among cadres and workers, and at the same time put forward specific requirements to each Party member, and organized everyone to discuss these issues. As a result, it was precisely because there were ideological obstacles in some Party member cadres that the work plan could not be implemented.

Like the Party member congress of the Boiler Workshop Branch that discussed the work plan, like this kind of Party member congress that lacks ideological content and repeats administrative meetings, there are many at present. Many Party organizations raise key issues in production at the Party member congress every month, but they do not organize everyone to discuss and analyze the ideological style issues related to the key issues of production, but organize everyone to discuss specific technical issues and management issues. Some Party member congresses have almost become meetings for dividing topics, finding tricks, and proposing rationalization proposals. The resolutions of the Party member congress are not much different from the administrative plans, and some are even directly copied from the administrative technical organization measures, plus some empty slogans such as "uniting the masses and ensuring completion." At the same time, the scope of the Party member congress's discussion of production is also very narrow, mostly limited to the key issues of the current month. Sometimes, these key issues may not necessarily involve major ideological issues and policy issues, and it may not be very difficult to solve them, so it may not be necessary to discuss them at the Party member congress. On the other hand, because the branch only focuses on these issues, it does not pay enough attention or does not pay attention at all to many major issues related to the implementation of the Party's economic policies, the establishment of socialist management ideas, and the criticism of capitalist management ideas in production. This weakens the ideological nature of the Party member congress and the role of the Party member congress.

The reason why many Party member congresses in industrial and mining enterprises lack ideological content is mainly because these Party organizations do not understand the fundamental difference between the Party's work and administrative work. The work of the Party organization is the work of people. Any policy and any work must be executed and completed by people. The task of the Party organization is to educate those who perform the task, so that they love this work, understand the significance of this work, and overcome difficulties with a high degree of enthusiasm and initiative to complete the tasks entrusted to them by the Party. The Party organization must also educate people to correctly understand the Party's policies and the Party's principles, and timely point out and criticize various ideological styles that violate this, to ensure that the Party's policies can be correctly implemented. The situation of the Boiler Workshop Branch fully proves that if the Party organization does not carry out the work of people, does not pay attention to people's ideological style, and directly handles economic affairs, the result will be of no help. The reason why problems in production should be brought to the Party is because they have already involved the Party's policies, the Party's principles, and the ideological style of cadres and workers, and need to be resolved from a political and ideological perspective. If the Party organization does not solve the political and ideological problems of people, but directly handles specific business problems, it will naturally not get any good results. Another bad consequence of using the Party member congress to replace administrative meetings and trade union meetings is that it affects the enthusiasm and creativity of trade union cadres and administrative cadres, and makes them accustomed to relying on the Party organization, which is very detrimental to production.

    厂矿中的党员大会为什么开得有好有坏
    宋琤
    厂矿企业中的党组织的主要任务是保证监督生产，厂矿企业中的党员大会就应该经常讨论有关生产的重大问题。目前，大多数厂矿企业中的党组织已注意到了这个问题。但是，因为讨论的方法不同，所以得到了不同的效果。下面就是一个很好的例子：
    一九五四年春天，大连机车车辆制造厂锅炉车间发生了严重的质量事故，锅炉补墙板需要返工，因此而造成的损失很大。中共锅炉车间支部委员会就把这个问题提到党员大会上讨论。支委会指定专人向大会做报告。报告人给大家算了细账，指出，补墙板返工的损失总计起来达一亿八千多万元（旧币）；同时影响三台机车不能按计划出厂，使需要机车的单位得不到机车；车间的大批力量进行返修，打乱了正常的生产计划，影响了下个月的生产。报告中指出：为了贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线，实现国家的社会主义工业化，现有的厂矿应该厉行节约，为国家积累更多的资金；应该按时完成计划，不断地供给国家以新的机器设备。而补墙板的返工，却浪费了国家大量的资金，没有按计划供给国家以新的设备。报告人根据支部的调查研究，向大家分析了造成质量事故的原因，一方面是有些干部和群众对待产品质量的责任心不强，以致有些有关保证质量的责任制度没有很好贯彻。另一方面，是在职工中存在着骄傲情绪，大家觉得这些活过去都干过，也没有发生过问题，质量还不坏，因而马虎大意起来。全体党员根据支部的报告，对这个问题作了认真的讨论，大家首先批评了支部，“不发生质量问题时，支部就不对产品质量进行监督；发生了问题，支部就手忙脚乱起来，又是开会，又是批评。”大家又批评了行政领导干部，只催进度，不管质量好坏；还批评了工会没有做好推广先进经验的工作。大家对于造成质量事故有关的人都提出了批评，同时也进行自我批评，有人揭发有些小组不遵守操作规程，有人批评有些党员不重视质量。
    这次党员大会的效果是很好的。原来，支部只是笼统地感到保证质量的工作做得不好，经过党员们的批评，使支部认识到，在保证质量方面，支部的工作是被动的，突击的，缺乏预见性，没有经常地对党员进行重视质量的教育，和一切忽视质量的思想进行斗争。这次会后，支部就经常注意在党员和非党群众中进行重视质量的教育，宣传重视质量的先进人物和先进思想。党员和群众对产品质量有了正确的认识，在执行规程和制度方面，也比过去认真了。支部还帮助工会改进推广先进经验的工作。行政领导干部也根据党员大会的决议，整顿和健全了有关保证质量的各种责任制度，协同工会制订了补墙板的操作规程，举行了补墙板的技术观摩会。
    还是锅炉车间支部，一九五四年七月召开的一次党员大会就开得不好。这次大会讨论贯彻作业计划的问题。在党员大会上，支部向大家作了有关贯彻作业计划的报告，详细地谈到怎样编制作业计划，怎样下达作业计划以及怎样进行调度等等。支部在报告中还具体地介绍了大炉工段推行轮班作业计划的经验。但是，在大会上发言的却只是少数行政管理干部，大多数的党员还没有弄清楚报告的内容，就只能讲讲：“大炉工段的经验很好，我们今后学习。”这次大会虽然多少也起了一点作用，但是，作业计划推行得并不顺利。工段长、行政小组长（大都是党员）都不肯执行轮班作业计划。他们说有没有轮班作业计划都是一样。
    质量问题是生产中的重大问题，贯彻作业计划同样是生产中的重大问题。但是，为什么一次大会开得很成功，一次大会失败了呢？问题在哪里呢？问题在于讨论补墙板的质量问题的党员大会上，支部的报告是一个比较有思想内容的报告（虽然这个报告的自我批评精神还不够）。活做坏了返工，这本来是大家习以为常并不认为严重的事情，但是支部通过具体分析，使大家改变了习以为常的看法，把产品质量和贯彻党的总路线实现国家的社会主义工业化联系起来了，激发了大家对产品质量的高度责任心。报告在分析造成质量事故的原因时，着重地指出了工人群众思想作风方面存在的问题，引导大家来揭发和批判领导干部和工人群众对待质量问题的错误认识和错误态度。这次党员大会虽然没有组织大家具体地去解决管理方面、技术方面的问题，但是因为大家已经认识了产品质量问题的重大意义，就能够自觉地根据大会决议努力解决那些自己应该解决的问题。
    讨论作业计划的党员大会的情况却完全不同，这次会议实际是重复行政会议。支部没有从政治上去阐明推行轮班作业计划的重大意义，激发大家克服困难、认真学习这一先进管理方法的热情和决心。支部也没有分析推行作业计划将要碰到什么困难，特别是在干部、群众中可能遇到的各种思想障碍，同时向每一个党员提出具体的要求，组织大家围绕这些问题进行讨论。结果，就正是因为在一部分党员干部中有思想障碍，作业计划便推行不了。
    像锅炉车间支部这样讨论作业计划的党员大会，像这样缺乏思想内容的、重复行政会议的党员大会，在目前是很多的。很多党组织每月在党员大会上提出生产中的关键问题，但是，他们却不去组织大家讨论分析有关生产关键的思想作风问题，而是组织大家讨论具体的技术问题和管理问题。有些党员大会差不多成了分课题、找窍门、提合理化建议的会议。党员大会的决议和行政计划没有多大区别，有些甚至是照抄行政的技术组织措施，加上一些“团结群众，保证完成”之类的空洞号召。同时，党员大会讨论生产的范围也很狭小，大多只限于当月的关键问题。有时，这些关键问题不一定牵扯到重大的思想问题和政策问题，解决起来也不一定十分困难，因而不一定需要在党员大会上讨论。另一方面，因为支部只抓住这些问题，对于生产中许多有关党的经济政策的贯彻，有关树立社会主义经营管理思想，批判资本主义经营管理思想等重大问题就注意不够或根本没有注意。这就削弱了党员大会的思想性和党员大会的作用。
    许多工矿企业中的党员大会所以缺少思想内容，主要是因为这些党组织弄不清楚党的工作和行政工作的根本区别，党组织的工作是对人的工作。任何一项政策、任何一件工作都要靠人去执行、去完成。党组织的任务就是去教育那些执行任务的人，使他们热爱这项工作，懂得这项工作的重大意义，以高度的积极性和主动性去克服困难，完成党委托给他们的任务。党组织还要教育人们正确地理解党的政策、党的原则，及时指出并批判各种与此相违背的思想作风，保证党的政策得以正确贯彻。锅炉车间支部的情况充分证明，党组织如果不去进行对人的工作，不注意人的思想作风，而去直接处理经济事务工作，其结果是与事无补的。生产中的问题所以要提到党的面前来，是因为它已经牵涉到党的政策、党的原则和干部群众的思想作风等问题，需要从政治思想方面来解决。党组织不去解决人的政治思想问题，而去直接处理具体的业务问题，自然不会得到什么良好的结果。用党员大会去代替行政会议和工会会议的另一个恶果，是影响了工会干部和行政干部的积极性和创造性，使他们习惯于依赖党组织，这对于生产是很不利的。
