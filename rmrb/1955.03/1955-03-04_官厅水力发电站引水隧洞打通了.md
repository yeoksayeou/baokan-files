The nation's largest artificial lake – the Guanting Reservoir – was completed in the spring of 1954, and all the builders who participated in the construction of the reservoir then threw themselves into the construction of the Guanting Hydropower Station. This massive power station is the first newly built hydropower station in North China. The power station itself includes two major projects: the water diversion tunnel and the power plant building. In the future, after the power station is completed, the water stored in the reservoir will powerfully drive the turbines through the water diversion tunnel, generating a strong current to supply the needs of areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan.

The water diversion tunnel section of this massive project officially started construction on May 16 last year, with drilling proceeding from the north and south sides towards each other. The water diversion tunnel is 770.8 meters long, with an excavation diameter of 7.4 meters, which is even larger than a large railway tunnel. The entire tunnel body had to pass through seven or eight different types of rocks, with more than 20 large and small faults. When encountering quartzite, the wind drill would spark and couldn't penetrate it. When encountering loose rock, a hole could be easily dug with a pickaxe, easily causing a collapse, which brought great difficulties to the construction. But even the hardest rock couldn't beat the workers' determination. Regardless of day or night, wind or snow, the workers always labored happily, and they came up with various methods to overcome the difficulties. The military worker Ma Xiuming's team created the "three no delays" (no delay in drilling, no delay in clearing, no delay in supporting) work method in the tunnel, which enabled the project to proceed smoothly and rapidly. The clearing workers created the "layered slag removal method" and the "relay loading method," which improved the slag removal rate. The carpenters created the "suspension beam support method," which ensured the progress and safety during construction.

By February 20, the construction teams drilling from both sides of the tunnel had approached their meeting point. The sound of wind drills could already be heard from both sides. After the last blasting, everyone rushed in through the thick smoke. The last stone wall collapsed, and the water diversion tunnel was completed! After nine months of intense construction, the workers finally met in the water diversion tunnel. Everyone rushed up, shook hands, and hugged each other, jumping and singing, immersed in revelry.

Now, the people participating in the construction of the Guanting Hydropower Station are working hard on other tasks. Everyone unanimously and firmly stated: We must continue to strive and advance, and continue to work hard to strive to send electricity to Beijing by the end of 1955.

    官厅水力发电站引水隧洞打通了
    汪文廉
    全国最大的人造湖——官厅水库在一九五四年春天完工后，所有参加修筑水库的建设者们，接着又投入了官厅水力发电站的修建工程。这个规模巨大的发电站是华北第一座新建的水力发电站。发电站本身包括引水隧洞和发电厂房两大主要工程。将来发电站修好后，水库内蓄存的水将通过引水隧洞有力地推动涡轮，发出强大的电流，供应北京、天津、唐山等地区的需要。
    这个庞大工程中的引水隧洞部分，是在去年五月十六日正式开工的，南北相向凿进。引水隧洞全长七百七十点八公尺，开挖直径七点四公尺，比通火车的大隧洞还要大。全部洞身要穿过七、八种不同的岩石，大小断层二十多处，遇着石英岩，风钻一打一冒火，打也打不动；遇着松散的岩石，洋镐一刨一个窟窿，很容易造成塌方事故，这就给施工带来了莫大的困难。但岩石再硬也硬不过工人们的决心。不管白天黑夜，风里雪里，工人们总是愉快地劳动着，他们想出各种办法来克服困难。军工马秀明班在洞内创造了“三不误”（打钻不误、清方不误、支撑不误）的工作法，使工程得以顺利迅速地进展；清方工创造了“分层出碴法”和“接力装车法”，提高了清碴率；木工创造了“悬梁支撑法”，保证了施工中的进度和安全。
    到二月二十日，洞内两面凿进的建设队伍已接近会师了。两边的风钻声已能听到了。当最后一次炮爆破后，大家都冒着浓烟冲了进去。最后的一堵石壁轰倒了，引水隧洞打通了！经过九个月的紧张施工，工人们终于在引水隧洞中会师了。大家拥上去，互相握手，互相拥抱，跳呀，唱呀，一时浸沉在狂欢里了。
    现在，参加官厅水电站建设的人们，正紧张地进行其他各项工作。大家一致坚决表示：一定再接再厉，继续前进，为争取在一九五五年年底把电送到北京而继续努力。
