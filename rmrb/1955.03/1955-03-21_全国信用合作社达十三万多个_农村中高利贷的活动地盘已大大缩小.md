    Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: Currently, over 130,000 credit cooperatives have been established in rural areas nationwide, an increase of more than twelvefold compared to the end of 1953, basically completing the development plan for last winter and this spring. Currently, approximately 60% of townships nationwide have an average of one credit cooperative per township. There are already more than 400 counties where every township has a credit cooperative. In Shanxi Province, which has experienced rapid development, credit cooperative business activities have spread to 94% of townships and administrative villages. In provinces such as Hubei, Shaanxi, and Jilin, over 80% of townships and administrative villages have launched credit cooperative business activities. In these provinces, a socialist rural financial network led by the National Bank and based on credit cooperatives has been formed in the vast rural areas. Zhejiang Province, which had only two credit cooperatives at the end of 1953, now has more than 4,700 credit cooperatives. The number of credit cooperatives in Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces has also increased from more than ten at the end of 1953 to several thousand. The number of members of national credit cooperatives has exceeded 70 million, an increase of elevenfold compared to the end of 1953. From 1954 to the present, various localities have trained more than 300,000 credit cooperative cadres, basically meeting the needs of the large-scale development of credit cooperatives.

    Credit cooperatives have become a strong assistant to the National Bank in rural areas in supporting agricultural production, combating usury, and absorbing idle rural funds. By the end of 1954, the balance of shares and deposits of credit cooperatives totaled more than 287 million yuan, equivalent to more than half of the National Bank's deposit balance during the same period. In 1954, the cumulative amount of loans issued was more than 314 million yuan. Among them, the loans issued by credit cooperatives in Shanxi, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces accounted for about two-thirds of the National Bank's agricultural loans. During the grain, cotton, and oilseed purchase period last winter and this spring, credit cooperatives in various localities absorbed more than 200 million yuan of farmers' deposits and then redeposited them in banks, equivalent to 72.5% of the National Bank's preferential grain and cotton savings deposits during the same period.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: In areas with faster development of credit cooperatives, the scope of usury activities in rural areas has been greatly reduced. According to a survey conducted by the People's Bank of China in 159 townships and administrative villages in seven provinces, including Shanxi and Jilin, in 1953, when these townships and villages had not established credit cooperatives, a total of 2,570 farmer households borrowed at high interest rates; after the establishment of credit cooperatives in 1954, the number of borrowers at high interest rates decreased to 80 households. In 39 typical townships and villages in four provinces, including Rehe and Heilongjiang, the number of usury households and the amount of loans were also reduced by more than 90% compared with 1953. The funds from these usurious loans are gradually being transferred to agricultural and sideline production, or deposited in credit cooperatives. According to a survey of 57 townships in Shanxi, Jilin, and other provinces, a total of 287 usurers deposited more than 30,000 yuan of usurious capital into credit cooperatives because they could not operate.

    Under the influence of credit cooperatives, the proportion of general private lending in rural areas is gradually decreasing, and lending interest rates are also declining. In the 30 townships covered by 14 credit cooperative business offices in Shitun, Chishe, and Baichi in Shanxi Province, the amount of private lending decreased to 0.3% in 1954 compared with the initial establishment of credit cooperatives. The interest rates on general private loans in most areas have dropped from 5% or even 20% to below 3% or around 2%.

    全国信用合作社达十三万多个
    农村中高利贷的活动地盘已大大缩小
    【新华社二十日讯】目前全国农村已建立信用合作社十三万多个，比一九五三年底增加十二倍以上，基本上完成去冬今春的发展计划。现在全国约有百分之六十以上的乡平均每乡都有了一个信用合作社。乡乡有信用合作社的县已有四百多个。在发展较快的山西省，信用合作社的业务活动已遍及百分之九十四的乡和行政村；在湖北、陕西、吉林等省，都有百分之八十以上的乡和行政村开展了信用合作社的业务活动。在这些省内，广大农村中已组成由国家银行领导、以信用合作社为基础的社会主义的农村金融网。一九五三年底只有两个信用合作社的浙江省，现在信用合作社发展到四千七百多个。云南、贵州等省的信用合作社也由一九五三年底的十多个发展到数千个。全国信用合作社的社员已超过七千万人，比一九五三年底增加十一倍。从一九五四年到现在，各地共训练了信用合作社干部三十多万人，基本上满足了信用合作社大发展的需要。
    信用合作社在扶助农业生产、打击高利贷和吸收农村闲散资金方面，已成为国家银行在农村的强有力的助手。到一九五四年底，信用合作社的股金和存款余额共二亿八千七百多万元，相当于国家银行同时期存款余额的一半以上。一九五四年发放贷款累计共三亿一千四百多万元。其中，山西、湖南、福建等省信用合作社发放的贷款已相当于国家银行农业贷款的三分之二左右。在去冬今春粮、棉、油料收购时期，各地信用合作社吸收农民存款然后转存银行的共两亿多元，相当于同期国家银行粮棉优待储蓄存款的百分之七十二点五。
    【新华社二十日讯】在信用合作社发展较快的地区，农村高利贷的活动地盘已大大缩小。据中国人民银行在山西、吉林等七个省一百五十九个乡和行政村的调查，一九五三年这些乡、村没有建立信用合作社时，借高利贷的农户共有二千五百七十户；一九五四年建立信用合作社以后，借高利贷的减少到八十户。热河、黑龙江等四个省的三十九个典型乡、村内，高利贷的户数和放债金额也比一九五三年减少百分之九十以上。这些地区的高利贷资金逐渐向农业、副业生产转移，或者存入信用合作社。据山西、吉林等省五十七个乡调查，共有二百八十七户高利贷者因无法活动，把高利贷资本共三万多元存入了信用合作社。
    在信用合作社的影响下，农村一般私人借贷的比重在逐渐缩小，借贷利息也在下降。山西省石屯、赤社、百尺等十四个信用合作社业务所及的三十个乡内，一九五四年和信用合作社初建立时比较，私人借贷金额下降到百分之零点三。一般地区的私人借贷利息，大都已由五分甚至二十分下降到三分以下或二分左右。
