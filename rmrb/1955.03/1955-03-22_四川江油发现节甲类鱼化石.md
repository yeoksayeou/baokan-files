    Fossil of Placoderm Fish Discovered in Jiangyou, Sichuan
    A fossil of a placoderm fish, a creature from 300 million years ago, has been discovered in Jiangyou County, Sichuan. The fish fossil includes the head shield, median dorsal plate, anterior lateral plate, and ventral plate, preserved in impure grayish-black limestone. Relatively complete placoderm fish fossils have been found more frequently in Europe and North America, but this is the first discovery of its kind in China. Paleontologists have determined that the characteristics of this placoderm fish have not been seen in known species and that it is a collateral branch of the ancestors of the giant Dinichthys and Titanichthys, thriving in the Devonian period approximately 300 million years ago.
    The placoderm fish fossil was discovered by Le Senxun, a professor in the Geology Department of Chongqing University, on paving stones near Guanwu Temple in Jiangyou County. It has now been named "Jiangyou Fish of Le." Its discovery not only enriches the content of paleontological research but also provides valuable material for the study of ancient geography in China.

    四川江油发现节甲类鱼化石
    四川江油县发现了三亿年前的古生物——节甲类鱼化石。这块鱼化石包括头甲、中背甲、前侧甲及腹甲等，它们保存在不纯的灰黑色石灰岩中。像这样比较完整的节甲类鱼化石在欧洲、北美洲发现较多，而在我国还是第一次发现。经古生物学家研究证明，这种节甲类鱼的特征在已知的种属中还未见过，是巨大的恐鱼和雷鱼的祖先型的旁支，繁生于约三亿年前的泥盆纪时代。
    节甲类鱼化石是重庆大学地质系教授乐森璕在江油县观雾寺附近铺路石板上发现的。现已命名为“乐氏江油鱼”。它的发现不仅丰富了古生物学研究的内容，并对我国古地理的研究，提供了宝贵的材料。
