Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: According to Agence France-Presse: French Foreign Minister Pinay confirmed on the 17th at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly that France, Britain, and the United States will hold a separate meeting to discuss the "Indochina issue."

    It is worth noting that Pinay strangely mentioned that this meeting will consider the issues of "French troops withdrawing from Haiphong and implementing the political terms of the Geneva Accords." As everyone knows, these are issues that are already clearly stipulated in the Geneva Accords and there is no reason to discuss them. Moreover, the United States, Britain, and France have no right to unilaterally convene such a meeting, setting aside the other participating countries of the Geneva Accords.

    Foreign newspapers have already revealed that the purpose of the United States, Britain, and France holding this meeting is to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords. Now, there are reports that the three countries may take the form of holding talks in conjunction with the next NATO Council meeting to quietly hold this meeting; because the United States, France, and Britain themselves know that holding such a separate meeting is a complete violation of the spirit and letter of the Geneva Agreement.

### 美英法将举行单独会议  阴谋破坏日内瓦协定的实施

    美英法将举行单独会议
    阴谋破坏日内瓦协定的实施
    【新华社十九日讯】据法国新闻社报道：法国外交部长比内十七日在法国国民议会外交委员会会议上证实，法国、英国和美国将举行单独会议，讨论“印度支那问题”。
    值得注意的是，比内奇怪地提到这个会议将考虑“法军撤出海防和实施日内瓦协定政治条款”的问题。大家知道，这些都是在日内瓦协定上已有明文规定而毫无理由加以讨论的问题，更不用说，美、英、法三国根本无权撇开日内瓦协定的其他参加国而片面地召开这样的会议了。
    外国报纸曾经就透露过，美、英、法三国举行这个会议的目的是要破坏日内瓦协定的实施。现在，又有消息说，三国可能采取在下一次北大西洋公约组织理事会会议时附带举行会谈的形式，来悄悄地开这个会议；因为，美、法、英三国自己也知道举行这样的单独会议是完全违反日内瓦协议的精神和文字的。
