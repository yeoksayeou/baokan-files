    "Competition" in the "Free Market"
    Yao Shiguang

    In a higher industrial school, different teachers have the same requirements for students.

    The descriptive geometry teacher said, "Studying my course requires time. How can you learn it well without spending more time?" The higher mathematics teacher said, "If you don't learn my course well, it will be even more difficult in the second and third years. Therefore, I must lecture more. I would rather have the students scold me now than let them suffer in the future. They will thank me in the future."

    Under the "good intentions" of these two teachers, the workload of these two courses has greatly "expanded", and most of the students' less than twenty hours of self-study time per week is spent on these two courses.

    The chemistry teacher saw that the situation was not good: students were no longer reviewing chemistry. "Good! You don't pay attention to my course, I have to think of a way!" So he lectured more, assigned more homework, and gave fewer points. This method really worked, and the students had to pay attention to chemistry.

    The physics teacher was not willing to "show weakness". Originally, he planned to test in the middle of the term, but now he changed it to four tests a month. So the students held the physics book in their hands all day long again.

    There was also a teacher whose class could neither be tested nor have exercises assigned. He came up with a method of "fixed time" review, stipulating that every Tuesday evening from 7 to 9 pm, he and the students would review this course together in the classroom.

    After these teachers did this, fewer and fewer students participated in physical exercise. Once, the physical education teacher went to the student dormitory to encourage students to participate in sports activities. A student pointed to the thick stack of lecture notes and exercises on the table, and clasped his hands and said, "Sir, please spare me!" The teachers sarcastically said to each other: The students' self-study time is like a "free market", and we are all "competing" there!

    This "competition" among teachers is not a minor matter. Students not only cannot exercise, but also have to sacrifice their naps; they bring tiger balm to class and take sleeping pills at night, and their academic performance has generally declined.

    These teachers all hope that students will learn their courses well, and it cannot be said that they have "good intentions". Unfortunately, as we often say, good intentions sometimes do bad things. The reason is very simple. Students only have twenty-four hours a day. If one course "expands", other courses will be squeezed out. Knowing this, and still "expanding", is it a lack of overall perspective?

    There are of course many reasons for the students' excessive academic burden, but the "competition" in the "free market" caused by the teachers' lack of overall perspective is one of the important reasons. Stop this "competition" quickly, and as that student said, "spare" them, let them learn a little less and learn a little better!

    “自由市场”上的“竞争”
    姚世光
    在一个高等工业学校里，不同的教师对学生都有同样的要求。
    画法几何的教师说：“学我这门功课就是要花时间，不多花时间怎能学得好？”高等数学的教师说：“我这门功课要是学不好，到二三年级可就更困难了。所以我必须多讲一点，宁肯让学生现在骂我，我也不能让他们将来吃亏；等到将来，他们就要感谢我了。”
    在这两位教师的“一片好心”之下，这两门功课的课业分量就大大“膨胀”起来，学生每周不到二十小时的自学时间，大部分都用到这两门功课上了。
    化学教师一看形势不妙：学生都不复习化学了。“好！你们都不重视我这门功课，我得想个办法！”于是他就多讲、多留题、少给分。这个办法果然灵验，学生们不得不重视化学了。
    物理教师也不肯“示弱”，本来他计划到期中才测验，这时就改成一个月测验四次。于是学生又把物理书成天拿在手里了。
    还有一位教师，他的课既不能测验，又不能留习题，他想出一个“固定时间”复习的办法，规定每星期二晚七点到九点，他和学生一起在教室里复习这门课。
    这几位教师这么一来之后，参加体育锻炼的学生越来越少了。有一次体育教师到学生宿舍去发动学生参加体育活动。有个学生指了指桌上厚厚的一叠讲义和习题，又双手打拱说：“先生，您饶了我吧！”教师们自我讽嘲地说：学生的自学时间好比一个“自由市场”，咱们大家都在那里“竞争”哩！
    教师们这一“竞争”不要紧，学生不但不能锻炼了，连午睡也只得牺牲了；上课带着老虎油，晚上要吃安眠药，学习成绩普遍下降了。
    这几位教师都希望学生把功课学好，不能不说是“好心肠”。可惜正如我们常说的，好心肠有时却做了坏事情。道理很简单，学生每天的时间只有二十四小时，一门功课“膨胀”了，别的功课就要被挤掉；明知如此，还要“膨胀”，是不是缺乏整体观念？
    学生课业负担过重的原因当然是很多的，但是，教师缺乏整体观念而引起“自由市场”上的“竞争”，却是重要的原因之一。赶快停止这种“竞争”，正如那个学生所说的，“饶”了他们，让他们学少一点，学好一点吧！
