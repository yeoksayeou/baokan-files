Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 4th: Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister Kopecky presented one hundred sets of infant clothing and supplies to Cao Ying, the Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, at the Republic Government Building on March 3rd, and asked him to forward them to newborn babies in Zhangguozhuang, Beijing, China.

Present were Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister Jankovcova, Minister of Light Industry Marek, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Simovic, and representatives of the workers from the enterprises that produced these baby clothes and supplies.

In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Kopecky emphasized the importance of the friendship already established between the people of Vinahrice village in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Zhangguozhuang village in Beijing, China. He said that he had visited Zhangguozhuang when he led the Czechoslovak government delegation to attend the Chinese National Day celebration last year, and was warmly received by the farmers of the village. At that time, he learned that about one hundred babies are born in Zhangguozhuang every year. After returning to his country, he proposed donating these one hundred sets of infant clothing and supplies to Zhangguozhuang.

Minister Marek said that these items were made by the workers in their spare time using materials saved from over-fulfilling their plans. This is an expression of the Czechoslovak people's love for the children of the great fraternal Chinese people.

Ambassador Cao Ying expressed his heartfelt thanks in his speech and congratulated the eternal development of the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples.

    捷克斯洛伐克赠张郭庄农民一百套婴儿服装
    【新华社布拉格四日电】捷克斯洛伐克共和国副总理柯别茨基，三月三日在共和国政府大厦以一百套婴儿服装和用具交给中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛，并且请他转交给中国北京张郭庄的新生婴儿。
    在场的有捷克斯洛伐克副总理扬科夫卓娃、轻工业部长马列克、外交部副部长西莫维茨和生产这些婴儿衣服和用具的企业的职工代表等多人。
    柯别茨基副总理在致词中强调指出捷克斯洛伐克布拉格州维纳尔日采村和中国北京的张郭庄两个村子人民所已经建立的友谊的重要意义，他说他去年率领捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团参加中国国庆典礼时曾经到张郭庄参观，受到了这个村子的农民的热诚款待。当时他听说张郭庄每年大约有一百个婴儿出生。他回国以后就倡议赠送给张郭庄这个一百套婴儿服装和用具。
    马列克部长说，这些物品都是工人们在工作之余用节约下来的材料超计划制成的。这是捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱伟大的兄弟般的中国人民的子女的表示。
    曹瑛大使在致词中表示衷心的谢意，并且祝贺中捷两国人民的友谊永恒发展。
