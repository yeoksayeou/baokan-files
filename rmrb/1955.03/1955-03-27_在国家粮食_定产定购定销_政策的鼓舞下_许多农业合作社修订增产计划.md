Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: Encouraged by the state's measures regarding "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain, members of many agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and other provinces have held meetings to discuss the state's measures and revised their production plans to strive to increase agricultural production to guarantee the needs of the state and themselves.

During the discussion in the "Steel" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beilingtou Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, many members believed that the "Three Fixes" measure was a good method that benefited both the state and themselves. The cooperative originally planned to plant 100 mu of cotton, but now it has expanded to 150 mu, and will also plant another 50 mu of corn. After discussion, twenty-four agricultural production cooperatives in Yong'anzhuang Township, Mancheng County, Gucheng Township, Tong County, and the suburbs of Baoding City also revised their plans. Among them, three cooperatives decided to increase production by more than 7,000 catties of grain and more than 3,500 catties of cotton; another four cooperatives planned to increase investment to purchase three draught animals and thirty-six pigs.

Some members of the Minzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengjiapeng Village, Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, believed that the "Three Fixes" measures could enable the state to have sufficient grain to ensure the smooth progress of various constructions; at the same time, farmers could more systematically allocate their surplus grain, which was truly a win-win situation. The cooperative strives to produce eight more shi of grain per hectare. The Nongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bajiazi Village, Jixian County, plans to reduce the planting area of wheat and expand the planting of high-yield crops such as corn and sorghum, and also expand 5 hectares of paddy fields for rice cultivation, so that it can increase production by another 51,000 catties on the basis of the original increase. After publicizing the "Three Fixes" measures, 454 agricultural production cooperatives in Huachuan County have basically completed the revision of their plans.

Agricultural production cooperatives in Xinhui County and Meixian County, Guangdong Province, have all formulated production increase plans. The First-Class High-Yield Model Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinhui County requires the total output of the cooperative this year to reach more than 1,115,000 catties, striving to achieve an average yield of 970 catties of rice per mu. In addition to the grain purchased by the state, the cooperative also has a large amount of grain for its own use. Agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Gutang Township, Meixian County, have also formulated production increase plans.

Agricultural production cooperatives in Dongcai Township, Tongshan County, Wayao Township, Jiangdu County, Malu Township, Jiading County, and Dongshan Town, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, have all revised their production increase plans, and the number of people weeding and topdressing wheat fields has increased compared to usual. The Shuguang Cooperative in Huanghe Township, Jiangning County, recently completed its ten-day production plan two days ahead of schedule. The Agricultural Production Cooperative in Malu Township, Jiading County, revised its rice production increase plan for this year, requiring an average yield per mu to increase by 89 catties compared to last year.

Encouraged by the "Three Fixes" measures, members of twenty-two agricultural production cooperatives in Pengzhen Township, Shuangliu County, Sichuan Province, have found more than ten practical and feasible ways to increase production. After listening to the communication of the "Three Fixes" measures, the Taihe Cooperative and surrounding mutual aid teams in Xinqiao Township, Bishan County, launched a labor competition. At the first crow of the rooster, members went to collect garbage one or two li away, and all the women in the cooperative were mobilized to pull grass and accumulate fertilizer. In the past six days, the entire cooperative has accumulated more than 58,000 catties of fertilizer and cultivated more than 60 mu of paddy fields. Member Xiong Guoliang is a production expert, but in the past, his production was not active. After discussing the "Three Fixes" measures, he told his wife to get up early to cook and prepare to work before dawn, and he now earns three or four more work points per day than in the past.

    在国家粮食“定产定购定销”政策的鼓舞下
    许多农业合作社修订增产计划
    【新华社二十六日讯】河北、黑龙江、广东、江苏、四川等省许多农业生产合作社社员纷纷集会讨论国家关于粮食“定产、定购、定销”的措施，并修订生产计划，争取提高农业生产来保证国家和自己的需要。
    河北省定县北陵头村“钢铁”农业生产合作社在讨论时，不少社员认为“三定”措施是对国家和自己都有利的好办法。这个社原计划植棉一百亩，现在扩大到一百五十亩，另外再种五十亩玉米。满城县永安庄乡、通县古城乡和保定市郊的二十四个农业生产合作社讨论后也纷纷修订了计划。其中有三个社决定再增产七千多斤粮食和三千五百多斤棉花；另有四个社计划增加投资添购三头耕畜、三十六头猪。
    黑龙江省龙江县冯家棚村民主农业生产合作社有些社员认为：“三定”措施能使国家掌握足够的粮食，保证各项建设顺利进行；同时农民也能更有计划地支配自己的余粮，这真是两全其美。这个社争取每垧地要多打八石粮食。集贤县八家子村农丰农业生产合作社计划减少小麦种植面积，扩大种植玉米、高粱等高产作物，另外扩大五垧水田种稻，这样就可以在原增产基础上再增产五万一千斤。桦川县四百五十四个农业生产合作社在宣传“三定”措施后，修订计划已基本完成。
    广东省新会县和梅县农业生产合作社都订出增产计划。新会县一等丰产模范农业生产合作社要求全社今年总产量达到一百一十一万五千多斤，争取每亩水稻平均产量达到九百七十斤。这个社除国家定购的粮食外，还有大量的粮食供自己支配。梅县古塘乡农业社和互助组也都订出了增产计划。
    江苏省铜山县东蔡乡、江都县瓦窑乡、嘉定县马陆乡、江宁县东山镇的农业生产合作社都修订了增产计划，麦田锄草追肥人数比往常增加。江宁县黄和乡曙光社最近提前两天完成十天生产计划。嘉定县马陆乡农业生产合作社修订了今年水稻增产计划，每亩平均产量要求比去年增加八十九斤。
    四川省双流县彭镇乡的二十二个农业生产合作社社员，在“三定”措施鼓舞下，找出了十多项切实可行的增产办法。璧山县新桥乡太和社和周围互助组，在听取“三定”措施的传达后，展开了劳动竞赛。鸡叫头遍，社员就到一、二里路外去挑垃圾，全社妇女也出动扯草积肥。六天来，全社积肥五万八千多斤，耕了六十多亩水田。社员熊国良是生产能手，但过去生产不积极，讨论了“三定”措施后，天不亮就叫他老婆起来煮饭准备去干活，每天要比过去多做三、四个工分。
