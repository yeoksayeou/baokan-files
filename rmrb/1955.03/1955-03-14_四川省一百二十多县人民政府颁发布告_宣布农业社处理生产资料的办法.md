    Sichuan Province More Than 120 County People's Governments Issue Public Announcements
    Announcing Measures for Agricultural Cooperatives to Handle Means of Production
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Governments of more than 120 counties in Sichuan Province, including Wenjiang, Jiangjin, Nanchong, Luxian, Wanxian, and Fuling, issued public announcements one after another in mid-January, announcing several specific policies on the current handling of farmers' means of production by agricultural production cooperatives. This was done to stabilize the production mood of the masses and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. The contents of the announcements in each county are roughly the same.
  The announcements generally state in the first paragraph: In order to further develop agricultural production, vigorously support the country's socialist industrialization, and further improve farmers' lives, the People's Government has always advocated and strived to help the masses of farmers establish agricultural production cooperatives. However, to run agricultural production cooperatives well, it is necessary to implement the policies of voluntariness and mutual benefit that the People's Government has repeatedly announced in the past, and no one shall violate or distort these policies. Recently, in some places, in the work of establishing and running cooperatives, either because our cadres did not explain the policies to the farmers clearly enough and the publicity and education were not thorough enough; or because some farmers mistakenly listened to rumors from the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and some lawless elements lurking in the countryside, some farmers have misunderstood and worried about the establishment and running of cooperatives and the development of production, and even sold cattle, were unwilling to feed pigs, and cut down trees, which are seriously detrimental to production. In order to correct these shortcomings and errors, conscientiously implement the policies of voluntariness and mutual benefit in the establishment and running of cooperatives, and do a good job in the agricultural cooperativization movement and production work, each county has made some specific regulations in the announcement on specific issues such as draft cattle, farm tools, trees, and pig feed in the work of establishing and running cooperatives.
    The announcement states: When privately owned draft cattle of cooperative members are transferred to the public ownership of the entire cooperative, it must be decided according to the owner's willingness and the production needs of the cooperative and the members. If the owner is unwilling to convert his draft cattle into public ownership for the entire cooperative at a depreciated price, the cooperative can rent it at the general rental market price. If the owner is willing to depreciate his draft cattle and transfer it to the public ownership of the cooperative, it must be reasonably depreciated according to the market price, and the cooperative shall pay off the payment within an appropriate period of time recognized by everyone. Before the payment is cleared, interest should be calculated on the unpaid portion in accordance with regulations. All small farm tools such as hoes and sickles that are often used at hand are still owned by the cooperative members themselves and are not made public. When large farm tools (such as carts, winnowing machines, etc.) privately owned by cooperative members are voluntarily depreciated and transferred to the public ownership of the entire cooperative, they should be handled in the same way as draft cattle. If the cooperative members still wish to maintain private ownership, and the cooperative needs to use them uniformly, a reasonable rental fee should be given each year. If it is damaged, the cooperative shall be responsible for compensation. The trees (including bamboo forests) originally on the land of cooperative members who join the cooperative shall remain the property of the cooperative members and shall not be included in the cooperative.
    The announcement also made clear provisions on how to solve the feed problem for pigs owned by the public in the cooperative and pigs privately owned by cooperative members, and how cooperative members should pay an appropriate amount of production funds (seeds, fodder, and cash) as the production base for the entire cooperative when joining the cooperative.
    After the counties issued the announcements, they have had a significant effect on promoting production development. Now these counties are also combining with spring plowing production work to continue to publicize these specific policies to the broad masses, and further enhance the production enthusiasm of the masses.

    四川省一百二十多县人民政府颁发布告
    宣布农业社处理生产资料的办法
    【本报讯】四川省温江、江津、南充、泸县、万县和涪陵等一百二十多县人民政府，在一月中旬先后颁发布告，宣布农业生产合作社当前处理农民生产资料问题的几项具体政策，安定群众生产情绪，巩固农业生产合作社。各县布告内容大致相同。
  布告大都在第一段说明：为了进一步发展农业生产，有力支援国家社会主义工业化和进一步改善农民生活，人民政府历来就是提倡并尽力帮助农民群众兴办农业生产合作社的。但是，要把农业生产合作社办好，就一定要贯彻人民政府过去一再宣布过的自愿互利的政策，任何人对这些政策都不得违反和曲解。最近有些地方在建社和办社工作中，或者是由于我们干部对农民交代政策不够明确，宣传教育不够深入；或者是由于部分农民误听潜藏在农村的反革命残余分子及某些不法分子的谣言，一些农民对建社、办社和发展生产发生了某些误解和疑虑，甚至发生了卖掉耕牛、不愿喂猪、砍掉树木等严重不利于生产的现象。为了纠正这些缺点和错误，切实贯彻建社、办社中的自愿互利政策，把农业合作化运动和生产工作做好，各县在布告中就建社办社工作中对耕牛、农具、树木和猪的饲料等具体问题作了一些具体的规定。
    布告中说：社员私有耕牛转为全社公有时，必须根据本主自愿以及合作社和社员的生产需要来决定。如果本主不愿把他的耕牛折价转为全社公有时，可以按一般的租用市价由社租用。如果本主愿意把自己的耕牛折价归合作社公有，必须按照市价合理折价，由合作社在大家公认适当的年限以内把款付清。在没有还清以前，没有还的部分应当按照规定计算利息。凡属经常随手使用的锄头、镰刀等一些小农具，都仍然归社员自己所有，概不归公。凡属社员私有的大农具（如车、风车等）自愿折价转为全社公有时，应按照处理耕牛的同样办法处理。如果社员仍愿保持私有，合作社需要统一使用时，每年应给以合理的租用费。如果损坏了，应由合作社负责赔偿。社员入社的土地上原有的树木（包括竹林在内）一律仍归社员自己所有，不随同入社。
    关于社内公有的猪和社员私有的猪的饲料问题如何解决，社员入社时怎样交纳适当数量的生产资金（种子、草料和现金）作为全社的生产底垫，布告中也都作了明确的规定。
    各县颁发布告以后，已经发生了有利于生产发展的显著作用。现在这些县还正在结合春耕生产工作，继续向广大群众宣传这些具体政策，进一步提高群众的生产积极性。
