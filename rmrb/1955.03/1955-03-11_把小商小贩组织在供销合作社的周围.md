    Organizing Small Vendors Around Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    Xu Xing
    Chongren District in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, is a semi-mountainous area with thirteen townships and inconvenient transportation. In addition to the Chongren District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, there are 169 small vendors in the town. During the commercial peak season of 1954, the Chongren District Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to the countryside with goods for door-to-door purchases and supplies, which was welcomed by the farmers. Later, due to a shortage of manpower, the cooperative stopped sending people to the countryside and regarded all the surrounding small vendors as capitalists, failing to organize and utilize their role. As a result, it became inconvenient for farmers to buy and sell goods, and many small vendors also experienced difficulties in their businesses. Recently, the Sheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the state-owned Sheng County Department Store organized a work team to conduct a key experiment in Chongren District to organize small vendors for consignment and agency purchases.
    They first explained to the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative that small vendors are working people and can be organized under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative to engage in consignment, distribution, and other work. This is beneficial to the country, the farmers, and the small vendors. Then, they investigated and studied the business situation of the small vendors and determined a portion of households as fixed purchasing and sales agents for the supply and marketing cooperative. Through holding forums, they explained the policy to the small vendors, dispelling their ideological concerns about being unfree in consignment sales. The small vendors were all very enthusiastic, believing that they had embarked on a bright path. Finally, the supply and marketing cooperative, together with the purchasing and sales agents, studied and determined the activity routes and signed contracts regarding prices, commissions, etc. In addition, the directors, supervisors, and member representatives of the supply and marketing cooperative were notified to take care of and supervise these small vendors.
    These small vendors were very popular with the farmers after going to the countryside. The farmers in Qian Village, Chongren Township, took the initiative to beat gongs and shout, "The cooperative's purchasing and sales agents are here!" This not only enlivened the rural economy, but also increased the income of the purchasing and sales agents compared to before. Other small vendors also requested the supply and marketing cooperative to lead them in organizing.

    把小商小贩组织在供销合作社的周围
    徐行
    浙江省嵊县崇仁区是一个半山区，有十三个乡，交通不很方便。镇上除了崇仁区供销合作社外，还有一百六十九户小商小贩。在一九五四年的商业旺季，崇仁区供销合作社曾经派人带货下乡，沿门收购和供应，受到农民欢迎。后来，合作社因为人手少，没有继续派人下乡，把周围的小商小贩又都看作是资本家，没有去组织发挥他们的作用。结果，农民买货卖货不方便，不少小商小贩的营业也发生了困难。最近，嵊县供销合作社和国营嵊县百货商店等组织工作组，到崇仁区进行了组织小商小贩代销代购的重点试验工作。
    他们首先对供销合作社的干部说明小商小贩是劳动人民，可以在供销合作社的领导下，组织起来进行代销、经销等工作。这样对国家、对农民、对小商小贩都有好处。然后了解研究了小商小贩的营业等情况，确定一部分户作为供销合作社的固定代购代销员。通过举行座谈会，对小商小贩说明政策，解除了他们怕代销不自由等思想顾虑。小商小贩情绪都很高，认为走上了光明的道路。最后，供销合作社同代购代销的小商小贩研究确定了活动路线，订立了关于价格、手续费等的合同。另外，还通知供销合作社理事、监事和社员代表，请他们对这些小商小贩加以照顾和监督。
    这些小商小贩下乡以后很受农民欢迎。崇仁乡钱村农民主动敲锣叫喊：“合作社的代购代销员来了！”这样不但活跃了农村经济，代销代购的小商小贩收入也比以前增加。其他小商小贩也要求供销合作社领导他们组织起来。
