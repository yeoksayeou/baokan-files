People's courts across the country are gradually improving the defense system to effectively protect the defendant's right to defense. Now, in the courtrooms of many courts, in addition to obtaining full defense rights themselves, defendants also find their close relatives, guardians, or citizens introduced by people's organizations to defend them. In large cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, some defendants have also found people's lawyers to defend them. Some courts, with the consent of the defendant, also help the defendant designate a suitable person to defend him or her. Before the trial, the people's courts in various places explain the meaning, scope, and working methods of the defense to the defense counsel, and allow them to fully collect materials, consult case files, and talk with the defendant in advance to help them study the reasons for the defense.

According to the cases tried by courts in various places, the defense system plays an important role in fully understanding the facts of the case and preventing misjudgments. When the Yongji County People's Court in Jilin Province was trying the case of Zhou Wenfu's treatment of livestock causing the death of livestock, the judge originally believed that Zhou Wenfu had not obtained legal veterinary qualifications and used backward methods to treat livestock, causing the death of livestock and affecting agricultural production, and should be severely punished. Two local farmers defended the defendant in the courtroom, pointing out that the defendant was treating livestock at the request of the peasant masses and after being introduced by the village people's government and the animal husbandry technical guidance station. The defense counsel requested the court to handle the case according to the actual situation. The judges considered this situation and decided to give a lighter sentence, thus avoiding a misjudgment, which was supported by the audience. After full defense, the defendants were also convinced by the verdict. After the cases in Wuxi City People's Court, Jiangsu Province, were fully defended, no defendant was willing to appeal. The father of a defendant in the Xuanwu District People's Court in Beijing defended his son in court. When the court made a fair judgment based on materials from all parties, he was moved to tears and encouraged his sentenced son to work hard in prison and start a new life.

As a result of improving the defense system, the sense of responsibility of the trial personnel in many courts has also been enhanced. Many judges said that they must be fully prepared and have evidence when trying cases in the future, and must overcome subjective idealism and accept the supervision of the people. After the Xuanwu District People's Court in Beijing improved the defense system, the work style of the judges became more meticulous and cautious. They were able to listen to the defendant's opinions well and carefully study materials from all parties. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国各地人民法院逐步健全辩护制度
    全国各地人民法院正逐步健全辩护制度，以切实保护被告人的辩护权利。现在，在许多法院的审判庭上，被告除了本人获得充分的辩护权外，还寻找了自己的近亲属、监护人或人民团体介绍的公民等为自己辩护。在上海、北京等大城市里，有些被告还找到人民律师为自己辩护。有的法院在被告的同意下，还帮助被告指定合适的人为他辩护。各地人民法院在开庭审判前，都向辩护人交代辩护的意义、范围和工作方法，并允许他们事先充分搜集材料、调阅卷宗、和被告谈话等，帮助他们研究辩护的理由。
    根据各地法院所审理的案件来看，辩护制度对全面了解案情、防止错判起了重要的作用。吉林省永吉县人民法院在审理周文福医治牲畜造成牲畜死亡案件时，审判员原认为周文福没有取得合法兽医资格，用落后方法医治牲畜，造成牲畜死亡，影响农业生产，应该从严惩处；当地两个农民在审判庭上替被告辩护，指出被告是在农民群众要求下，经过村人民政府和畜牧技术指导站的介绍后，才去医治牲畜的，辩护人请求法院根据实际情况来处理这一案件。审判人员考虑了这一情况，决定从轻处理，这样避免了错判，因而得到了旁听群众的拥护。经过充分辩护的案件判决后，被告也都口服心服。江苏省无锡市人民法院经过充分辩护的案件，没有一个被告愿意提起上诉。北京市宣武区人民法院有一个被告的父亲在法庭上为他儿子进行了辩护，当审判庭根据各方面的材料公正判决后，他感动得流下了眼泪，当场勉励他被判刑的儿子到监狱后要好好劳动，重新做人。
    健全辩护制度的结果，也使许多法院的审判人员提高了工作责任心。许多审判员表示，今后审理案件要有充分准备和证据，一定要克服主观主义思想，接受人民群众的监督。北京市宣武区人民法院在健全辩护制度以后，审判员的工作作风更加细致慎重，能够很好听取被告的意见，认真研究各方面的材料。（新华社）
