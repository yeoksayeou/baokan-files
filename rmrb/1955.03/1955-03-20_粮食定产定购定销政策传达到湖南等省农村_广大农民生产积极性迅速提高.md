Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 19th: The "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain has inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in Hunan Province for production. The Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qidong County convened a meeting of its members on March 10th to discuss the "Three Fixes" policy, and everyone was delighted and eager to increase grain production. In Zhumu Township, Changde County, more than one hundred farmers enthusiastically discussed the "Three Fixes" policy at a meeting of representatives of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Everyone said: Now we have a clear understanding, let's work hard on production! A middle peasant named Zhang Zaocheng was originally worried that if he produced more grain, he would have to sell more, and he was hesitant to plow his hardpan fields. After discussing this at the meeting, he took the initiative to find the mutual aid group leader the next day to collect pond silt. Driven by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, the entire township decided to accumulate 200,000 dan of soil fertilizer and plow 1,000 mu of fields within ten days. The Huzhibin mutual aid group in Liegongqiao Township, Yiyang County, originally planned to plant only 18.4 mu of double-cropping rice, but now plans to plant 34.8 mu of double-cropping rice. In the past, the members were unwilling to spend more money to buy fertilizer, but now they are rushing to buy lime and manure. Li Shengkai, a middle peasant in Chucheng Township, Linli County, used to think that the policy of unified purchase and sales was good, but was worried that more production would mean more unified purchase. Now he has dispelled his concerns and decided to plant five mu of double-cropping rice in order to produce more grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 19th: In most areas of Heilongjiang Province, the grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy has been communicated to the district and village levels. On the 16th, the provincial-level organizations selected cadres to form seventeen working groups, which, together with more than two hundred cadres who were already in the countryside inspecting spring plowing preparations, went to more than fifty counties to help county and district cadres communicate and arrange the "Three Fixes" work to the peasants. Farmers in Keshan, Shuangcheng, Jingxing, Hulan, Nehe, and other counties have formulated or revised their production plans for this year during the discussion of the "Three Fixes."

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 18th: After the measure of fixing grain production, purchase and sales was transmitted to the base point townships controlled by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the peasants' production enthusiasm was greatly improved. Xu Tian Township and Junwangtun Township of Liaocheng Prefecture are both cotton-producing areas. When the news of implementing fixed grain production, purchase and sales reached these two townships, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups immediately launched discussions. Members of the Zhao Xiwena Agricultural Production Cooperative proposed that in addition to increasing cotton production, they should also strive to increase grain production and sell a certain amount of grain to the state. Members of the eleven agricultural production cooperatives in Junwangtun Township, in order to ensure that both cotton and grain production increase, invested 3,000 yuan in the agricultural production cooperatives after discussing the spirit of "Three Fixes." The nine agricultural production cooperatives in Shanqiandian Township, Laiyang County, have all checked and revised the cooperative's production increase plan based on the township's plan to increase production and purchase grain this year, and have also found many ways to increase grain production. Now, these nine cooperatives have decided to use methods such as increasing fertilizer application, deep plowing, and planting more high-yield crops to increase production by more than 520,000 jin of grain and peanuts compared to last year. The thirty-two mutual aid groups in the township that had not yet formulated production increase plans are also preparing to make plans. After recently hearing the propaganda of the "Three Fixes," the Tang Lianyou and Zheng Fenglin mutual aid groups ordered 360 jin of chemical fertilizer and 860 jin of cottonseed cake from the supply and marketing cooperative. After the grain "Three Fixes" policy was conveyed to Zhaozhuang Township, Licheng County, all agricultural production cooperatives in the township proposed to increase the production of more grain, complete the annual grain sales plan, and turn the current grain-deficient households into surplus grain households.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 19th: More than 330 peasant households in Cuijiatun Village, Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, recently formulated a plan for the whole year's grain production, consumption, sale, and purchase based on the grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales." According to their plan, under normal circumstances this year, the village can increase production by 14.2 percent compared to last year, and sell 17.5 percent more grain than last year. They also expect that if the production plan is realized, the number of grain-deficient households in the village will decrease, and the amount of grain supplied by the state this year will decrease from about 180,000 jin last year to more than 40,000 jin.

In formulating the plan, the farmers of Cuijiatun came up with various methods and used possible conditions for increasing production and saving. The Zhengyang and Qiming agricultural production cooperatives plan to produce an average of more than 840 jin per mu of sorghum on more than 400 mu of land this year, exceeding the local "fixed production" standard. In the grain consumption plan formulated by more than 330 peasant households in the village, 137 households adjusted their consumption standards according to their actual living conditions. As a result, a total of more than 13,600 jin of grain can be saved throughout the year.

    粮食定产定购定销政策传达到湖南等省农村
    广大农民生产积极性迅速提高
    【本报长沙十九日电】粮食“定产、定购、定销”的政策鼓舞了湖南省广大农民的生产积极性。祁东县五星农业生产合作社在三月十日就召开社员大会讨论了“三定”政策，大家都欢欣鼓舞争取增产粮食。常德县株木乡一百多个农民，在互助合作组织代表会上热烈地讨论了“三定”政策。大家说：这一下我们心里有了底了，努力搞生产吧！中农张造成原先担心粮食产多了就要多卖，迟迟没有翻耕板田。经过这次在会上讨论，第二天他就主动地找互助组组长去挑塘泥。在农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，全乡决定在十天内积二十万担土肥，犁田一千亩。益阳县第七区烈公桥乡胡质彬互助组原来只准备种十八亩四分田的双季稻，现在准备种三十四亩八分田的双季稻。组员们过去不愿多拿钱买肥料，现在都赶忙拿钱购买石灰和大粪。临澧县第七区楚城乡中农李盛开过去认为统购统销政策很好，但是担心多增产要多统购，现在已经打消了顾虑，决定种五亩双季稻，争取多打粮食。
    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】黑龙江省大部分地区已把粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策传达到区和村。十六日，省一级机关抽调干部组成了十七个工作组，配合已在农村检查备耕工作的二百多名干部，分别到五十多个县帮助县、区干部向农民传达布置“三定”工作。克山、双城、景星、呼兰、讷河等县的农民，在讨论“三定”中制订或修定了今年的生产计划。
    【新华社济南十八日电】粮食定产、定购、定销这一措施在山东省各中共地委掌握的基点乡传达后，当地农民的生产热情大大提高。聊城专区的徐田乡和军王屯乡都是产棉区，当实行粮食定产、定购、定销的消息传到这两个乡后，各个农业生产合作社和互助组马上展开了讨论。赵希文农业生产合作社的社员们提出除了增产棉花外，还要努力增产粮食，争取卖给国家一定数量的粮食。军王屯乡的十一个农业生产合作社的社员们为了保证棉花、粮食都增产，在讨论“三定”精神后，就向农业生产合作社投资三千元。莱阳县山前店乡的九个农业生产合作社，都已根据全乡今年增产和征购粮食的计划，检查和修定了社的增产计划，并且又找出了不少增产粮食的办法。现在，这九个社已经决定用增施肥料、多刨地、增种高产作物等办法，比去年增产五十二万多斤粮食和花生。这个乡原来还没有制定增产计划的三十二个互助组，也都准备订计划。唐连有、郑凤林两个互助组，最近听到“三定”的宣传后，又向供销合作社订购了三百六十斤化学肥料和八百六十斤棉籽饼。粮食“三定”政策传到历城县赵庄乡后，这个乡各个农业生产合作社都提出要增产更多的粮食，完成全年售粮计划，而且要使现在的缺粮户都变成余粮户。
    据新华社沈阳十九日电：辽宁省盖平县崔家屯村三百三十多户农民最近根据粮食“定产、定购、定销”制订了全年粮食生产、消费、出售和购买的计划。根据他们的计划，在今年年景正常的情况下，全村可比去年增产百分之十四点二，比去年多卖粮食百分之十七点五。他们还预计到假若生产计划实现了，村内缺粮户将减少，国家今年供应的粮食将由去年的十八万斤左右减少到四万多斤。
    崔家屯农民在制订计划中想出各种办法，利用可能增产和节约的条件。正阳、启明两个农业生产合作社今年四百多亩高粱地计划平均每亩生产八百四十多斤，超过了当地“定产”的标准。全村三百三十多户农民制订的粮食消费计划中，有一百三十七户根据自己实际生活情况，调整了消费标准。结果全年共可节约一万三千六百多斤粮食。
