West River Irrigation Project Completed and Water Released

The West River irrigation project, part of the expansion of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Sichuan, has been fully completed, and water was officially released on March 12. Over 5,000 farmers from Chongqing, Dayi, and Qionglai counties participated in the water release ceremony. At 12 noon, the newly built Sanhe Weir gate slowly opened, and the crystal clear water from the Dujiangyan Irrigation System tumbled down from the gate, triggering enthusiastic cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Sanhe Weir of the West River Irrigation Project, which started construction on December 1st last year, saw more than 13,000 laborers from Chongqing, Qionglai, and Dayi counties complete the 37-kilometer-long canal construction project after 90 days of hard work. It can irrigate 500,000 mu of farmland in Chongqing, Dayi, and Qionglai counties. The entire project includes 204 large and small structures, including modern water intake gates and reinforced concrete Xiejian aqueducts. This project will transform more than 25,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, convert more than 65,000 mu of winter water fields into two-season fields, provide irrigation for more than 27,000 mu of water-deficient fields, transform 160,000 mu of sweet potato sloping fields into two-season fields, and protect more than 14,000 mu of fields from flood disasters. It is estimated that this will increase rice production by 13.5 million jin per year.

    西河灌溉工程完工放水
    四川都江堰扩建工程中的西河灌溉工程已全部竣工，三月十二日正式放水。崇庆、大邑、邛崃三县五千多农民参加了放水典礼。中午十二时，新建的三合堰闸门徐徐开起，清澈见底的都江堰水，由闸门翻滚而下，群众中响起了热烈的欢呼和掌声。
    西河灌溉工程新建的三合堰，从去年十二月一日开工后，崇庆、邛崃、大邑三县一万三千多民工，经过九十天的辛勤劳动，完成了三十七公里长的修渠工程，可灌崇庆、大邑、邛崃三县的五十万亩田。全部工程包括现代化的进水闸门、钢筋混凝土斜江渡槽等二百零四座大小建筑物。这项工程将使二万五千多亩旱地变成水田，六万五千多亩冬水田变为两季田，二万七千多亩缺水田得到灌溉，十六万亩苕坂田变为两季田，一万四千多亩田免除洪水灾患。据估计，每年因此可增产大米一千三百五十万斤。
