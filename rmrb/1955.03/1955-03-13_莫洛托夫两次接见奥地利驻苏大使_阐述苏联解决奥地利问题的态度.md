Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 11th: TASS reports that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently held two meetings with the Austrian Ambassador to Moscow, N. Bischoff, on February 25th and March 2nd. Due to incorrect reports in foreign newspapers, including Austrian newspapers, regarding the content of the aforementioned meetings, the content of the meetings is hereby published as follows:

On February 25th, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received Austrian Ambassador to Moscow, Bischoff, and inquired about the Austrian government's attitude toward the Soviet government's proposals of February 8th regarding the resolution of the Austrian question.

As everyone knows, at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR this February, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his report on the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet government, made the following statement on behalf of the Soviet government regarding the Austrian question:

"The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the resolution of the Austrian question, and attaches great importance to the complete restoration of the independence of a democratic Austria in accordance with the interests of upholding and consolidating peace in Europe.

The Soviet government believes that any further delays in concluding an Austrian peace treaty are unjustified. At the same time, the dangers that plans such as the Paris Agreements, which remilitarize West Germany, will bring to Austria cannot be ignored.

Based on all the above, the Soviet government has reason to draw the following conclusions regarding the Austrian question:

First, it must first be noted that the study of solutions to the Austrian question cannot be separated from the German question, especially given the current plans to remilitarize West Germany, which increase the danger of a German-Austrian merger, the danger of annexing Austria.

Therefore, when concluding a peace treaty with Austria to rebuild an independent and democratic Austria, a solution must be sought that can exclude the possibility of a new German-Austrian merger, which requires the four powers to take corresponding measures on the German question that are agreed upon by everyone. If this is achieved, then the four powers' troops can withdraw from Austria before a peace treaty with Germany is concluded.

Second, Austria must undertake the obligation not to participate in any bloc or military alliance directed against any country that participated in the war against Hitlerite Germany with its armed forces and participated in the liberation of Austria, and must not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory .

The governments of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union must also guarantee compliance with these provisions.

Third, in order to resolve the Austrian question as soon as possible, a four-power conference must be convened without delay to discuss the German question and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria. This of course means that Austria should also participate in the resolution of the Austrian peace treaty question.

However, it must be taken into account that once the Paris Agreements, which pave the way for the revival of West German militarism, are ratified, they will form a serious threat of German-Austrian merger, that is, a threat to Austrian independence."

In the aforementioned meeting with the Austrian ambassador, Molotov said that the Soviet side believes that there is now a possibility of making progress in resolving the Austrian question based on the above-mentioned Soviet proposals, and that preliminary negotiations between Austria and the Soviet Union could help achieve this goal.

Private contacts with the leaders of the Austrian government can also clearly help to achieve this goal. Austrian Chancellor Raab has recently also talked about the wishes of the Austrian government.

The Austrian Ambassador said that he would immediately inform Vienna of the considerations mentioned by Molotov, and he requested an explanation of the Soviet proposal of February 8 regarding the Austrian question.

Molotov made this explanation, particularly explaining that the Soviet side does not want to make the resolution of the Austrian question dependent on the resolution of the German question, but only pointed out the naturally existing link between the two questions. The Soviet government attaches particular importance to the point that an agreement should be reached on measures aimed at preventing a new German-Austrian merger. In addition, it was pointed out that at the Berlin Conference, the Soviet side insisted on postponing the withdrawal of foreign troops from Austria until after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Now, the Soviet side proposes that the troops of the four countries do not have to wait until the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to withdraw from Austria, but the four countries should reach an agreement on corresponding measures agreed upon by everyone that are sufficient to exclude the possibility of Germany carrying out a new German-Austrian merger.

Molotov also said that the Soviet government also attaches great importance to the fact that Austria will not be dragged into any bloc or military alliance aimed at opposing the countries mentioned in the Soviet proposal, and that Austria's territory will not be used to establish foreign military bases. It is obvious that complying with this provision and having the governments of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union undertake corresponding obligations is also in Austria's own interests.

Molotov added that the Soviet government believes that the four-power conference with Austria's participation mentioned in the Soviet government's proposal of February 8 must be convened before the Paris Agreements are ratified.

On March 2, Austrian Ambassador N. Bischoff visited Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov and said that the Austrian government was very pleased to note the statement he made during his meeting with Mr. Bischoff on February 25. The Austrian government understands that the Soviet side has taken an important step forward. The Austrian government attaches particular importance to the statement that in order to resolve the Austrian question, it is necessary to reach an agreement on what necessary steps should be taken now and in the future to prevent a German-Austrian merger, and that after such an agreement is reached, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Austria can be realized.

In addition, Mr. Bischoff said that the Austrian government believes that in order to resolve the Austrian question, it is necessary to hold negotiations with all occupying powers, and the Austrian government understands that even now, the foundation for such negotiations is being prepared. The Ambassador expressed his hope for further clarification of the Soviet government's proposals on the Austrian question. Molotov replied that the Soviet side had expressed its initiative on the Austrian question, and had already stated its views in the specific and clearly worded proposals put forward by the Soviet government on February 8. As for the Austrian government's attitude towards the above-mentioned proposals, it has not yet been clearly stated. It is now appropriate to know the Austrian government's specific opinions on the Soviet government's proposals so that this discussion can continue.

Ambassador Bischoff promised to inform the Austrian government of the content of this meeting.

    莫洛托夫两次接见奥地利驻苏大使
    阐述苏联解决奥地利问题的态度
    【新华社讯】　塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫最近曾同奥地利共和国驻莫斯科大使纳·比萧夫会谈两次——二月二十五日和三月二日。由于外国报纸，包括奥地利报纸在内，不正确地报道了上述会谈的内容消息，特将会谈的内容公布如下：
    二月二十五日，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接见了奥地利共和国驻莫斯科大使比萧夫，并且向他询问奥地利政府对于今年二月八日苏联政府关于解决奥地利问题的建议的态度。
    大家知道，在今年二月苏联最高苏维埃会议上，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告中，曾经代表苏联政府就奥地利问题发表下述声明：
    “苏联非常重视解决奥地利问题，重视解决根据维持和巩固欧洲和平的利益完全恢复民主奥地利的独立的问题。
    苏联政府认为，缔结对奥和约方面的任何继续拖延都是没有理由的。同时，不能不考虑到像巴黎协定之类使西德重新军国主义化的计划会带给奥地利的那些危险。
    根据上述一切，苏联政府有理由对奥地利问题作出下列结论：
    第一，首先必须注意到，研究奥地利问题的解决办法不能脱离德国问题，尤其是鉴于现在有着使西德重新军国主义化的计划，这种计划增加了德奥合并的危险、并吞奥地利的危险。
    因此，在缔结一个重建独立的、民主的奥地利的对奥和约的时候，必须寻求一个能够排除新的德奥合并的可能性的解决办法，而这就要求四国就德国问题采取大家同意的相应措施。如果这一点做到了，那末四国军队在缔结对德和约以前，就可以从奥地利撤退。
    第二，奥地利必须承担这样的义务：不参加针对着曾经以自己的武装部队参加反希特勒德国战争和参加解放奥地利的任何一个国家的任何集团或军事联盟，并且不得准许在它的领土上建立外国军事基地。
    美国、英国、法国和苏联四国政府也必须保证遵守这些规定。
    第三，为了早日解决奥地利问题，必须毫不拖延地召开四国会议来讨论德国问题和缔结对奥和约的问题。这当然意味着奥地利也应参加对奥和约问题的解决。
    但是，必须考虑到，替复活西德军国主义开辟道路的巴黎协定一旦批准，就会形成德奥合并的严重威胁，也就是对奥地利独立的威胁”。
    在上述同奥地利大使的会谈中，莫洛托夫说，苏联方面认为，现在有着以苏联上述建议为基础在解决奥地利问题上取得进展的可能性，而奥地利同苏联进行初步谈判能够有助于达到这一目的。
    同奥地利政府的领袖们进行的私人接触显然也可以有助于达到这一目的。奥地利总理拉布最近也谈到了奥地利政府的愿望。
    奥地利大使说，他将马上把莫洛托夫所说的考虑告诉维也纳，而且，他就此要求解释苏联二月八日提出的关于奥地利问题的建议。
    莫洛托夫作了这种解释，特别解释了这样一点：苏联方面并不要使奥地利问题的解决取决于德国问题的解决，而是仅仅指出了这两个问题之间自然存在的联系。苏联政府特别重视这样一点：应该就目的在于防止新的德奥合并的措施达成协议。此外还指出：在柏林会议上，苏联方面曾经坚持把从奥地利撤退外国军队一事延期到缔结对德和约以后。现在，苏联方面建议四国的军队不必等到缔结对德和约就从奥地利撤退，但是四国应该就足以排除德国实行新的德奥合并的可能性的大家同意的相应措施取得协议。
    莫洛托夫还说，苏联政府也很重视奥地利不被拉入目的在反对在苏联的建议中所指出的国家的任何集团或军事联盟，并且不得把奥地利的领土用来建立外国军事基地。很明显，遵守这一规定，并且由美、英、法、苏四国政府承担相应的义务，这也是符合奥地利自己的利益的。
    莫洛托夫又说，苏联政府认为，苏联政府二月八日的建议中提到的有奥地利参加的四国会议必须在批准巴黎协定之前召开。
    三月二日，奥地利大使纳·比萧夫先生访问了苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫，并且说，奥地利政府非常满意地注意到他在二月二十五日同比萧夫先生会谈时发表的声明。奥地利政府了解到，苏联方面已向前迈进了重要的一步。奥地利政府尤其非常重视这项声明：为了解决奥地利问题，有必要就现在和将来应该采取什么必要步骤以防止德奥合并的问题达成协议，而且在达成这种协议以后，从奥地利撤退外国军队的事就可以实现了。
    除此以外，比萧夫先生还说，奥地利政府认为，为了解决奥地利问题，有必要同一切占领国举行谈判，而且奥地利政府了解，就是现在，这种谈判的基础正在准备中。大使表示希望得到就苏联政府关于奥地利问题的建议的进一步解释。莫洛托夫回答说，苏联方面已经表示了对奥地利问题的主动精神，而且已经在苏联政府二月八日提出的具体的和措辞明确的建议中表明了它的意见。至于奥地利政府对上述建议的态度如何，至今还没有清楚地表明。现在，宜于知道奥地利政府对苏联政府的这些建议的具体意见，以便能继续这种商谈。
    比萧夫大使答应将把这次会谈的内容告诉奥地利政府。
