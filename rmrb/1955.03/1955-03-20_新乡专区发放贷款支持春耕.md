    Xinxiang Prefecture Distributes Loans to Support Spring Ploughing
    State banks in various parts of Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, are actively issuing agricultural loans to support spring ploughing production. According to incomplete statistics, since the distribution began in late January, more than 400,000 yuan in spring ploughing loans have been issued throughout the prefecture. More than 1,400 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the prefecture have received loans, with the loan amount accounting for 42 percent of the total loans issued in the prefecture. More than 1,000 mutual aid teams have received loans, with the loan amount accounting for 14 percent of the total loans issued in the prefecture. The two items together account for about 56 percent of the total loans issued in the prefecture. Impoverished individual farmers, especially farmers in disaster areas, are also being taken care of with enthusiasm. The prefecture has specifically issued more than 60,000 yuan in loans to individual impoverished disaster victims, supporting more than 5,000 impoverished disaster-stricken households in production for self-salvation and restoring production. After receiving the loans, the farmers quickly added a batch of means of production. According to incomplete statistics, the loans issued in various places have helped farmers purchase 24 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 146 head of livestock, more than 200,000 jin of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer, as well as a large number of other spring ploughing production materials.

    新乡专区发放贷款支持春耕
    河南省新乡专区各地国家银行积极发放农业贷款，支持春耕生产。据不完全统计，从一月下旬开始发放以来，全区已经发放出春耕贷款四十多万元。全区已经有一千四百多个农业生产合作社得到了贷款，贷款金额占全区已发放贷款总数的百分之四十二；得到贷款的互助组有一千多个，贷款金额占全区总数的百分之十四；两项共占全区已发放贷款总数的百分之五十六左右。对于贫困的个体农民，特别是灾区农民，也热情地加以照顾。全区专门发放给个体贫困灾民的贷款达六万多元，共扶持了五千多户贫困灾民进行生产自救，恢复生产。农民们拿到贷款以后，都迅速添置了一批生产资料。据不完全统计，各地发放的贷款已经帮助农民购买了双轮双铧犁二十四部、牲口一百四十六头、饼肥和化学肥料二十多万斤，另外还有大批其他的春耕生产资料。　（宣金农）
