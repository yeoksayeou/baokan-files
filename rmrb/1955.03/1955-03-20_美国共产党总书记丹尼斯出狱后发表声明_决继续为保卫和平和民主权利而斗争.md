Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: According to the New York "Worker Daily," U.S. Communist Party General Secretary Dennis, who was illegally persecuted and sentenced by the U.S. government, issued a statement immediately after serving his term on March 1st. He declared that he would resolutely continue to struggle to defend peace, defend the democratic rights of the American people, and oppose the war conspiracies and new persecution conspiracies of the U.S. authorities.

Dennis said in a statement that he was convicted in the past for exercising the rights of freedom of speech and assembly, for propagating the beliefs of the working class, and for opposing Wall Street's plot to abolish the Bill of Rights and drag the United States into an atomic war. However, difficulties make strong people stronger. Dennis stated that he would immediately devote himself to the struggle against new persecution conspiracies, to defend civil rights and peace.

The "Worker Daily" published an editorial saying: On the day of the release of the party leader, in addition to congratulating them and their families, we are determined to smash new persecution conspiracies and defend their freedom. The editorial said: They walked out of prison with firm steps, their eyes shining with the light of battle. This is a day to rededicate ourselves to the fight.

After their release, Dennis and other leaders of the American Communist Party who were released at the same time received many telegrams and letters from local organizations of the American Communist Party, people's organizations, labor leaders, and victims of the Smith Act. They unanimously expressed warm congratulations and resolute solidarity with Dennis and other leaders of the American Communist Party.

The Communist Party organizations in Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Michigan unanimously expressed their warmest congratulations to Dennis and others in their letters. These party organizations stated that they would unite more people to resolutely struggle to defend peace, strive for the abolition of the Smith Act, oppose new persecution conspiracies, and safeguard the freedom of the party leaders. Lefter, the executive secretary of the Communist Party of Illinois, who was recently sentenced to imprisonment by the court under the "Communist Control Act," said in a telegram to Dennis: "Your return encourages us, and we promise to fight to defend peace and democracy, and to ensure that you are not subjected to a second trial."

The American Civil Rights Congress, victims of the Smith Act in Ohio and other regions, and labor leaders in Los Angeles and other places also sent telegrams to Dennis and others to express their congratulations and promised to fight to uphold their freedom and to defend peace and democracy.

    美国共产党总书记丹尼斯出狱后发表声明
    决继续为保卫和平和民主权利而斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】据纽约“工人日报”报道，被美国政府非法迫害判刑的美国共产党总书记丹尼斯在三月一日服刑期满出狱后，立即宣布要继续为保卫和平、保卫美国人民的民主权利、反对美国当局的战争阴谋和新的迫害阴谋而坚决斗争。
    丹尼斯发表谈话说，他过去因为执行言论自由和集会自由的权利，因为宣传工人阶级的信仰，因为反对华尔街取消权利法案和把美国拖进原子战争的阴谋而被判了罪。但是，困难会使坚强的人更坚强。丹尼斯表示他将立即投入反对新的迫害阴谋、保卫公民权利和和平的斗争中去。
    “工人日报”发表社论说：在党的领袖获释的这一天，我们除了向他们以及他们的家属表示祝贺以外，并且决心粉碎新的迫害阴谋，保卫他们的自由。社论说：他们以坚定的步伐走出了监狱，眼睛里闪耀着战斗的光芒。这是一个重新献身战斗的日子。
    丹尼斯和同时出狱的美国共产党其他领导人，在出狱后接到了美国共产党地方组织、人民团体、工人领袖、史密斯法受害者的许多电报和信件。他们一致对丹尼斯和美国共产党的其他领袖们表示热情的祝贺和坚决的声援。
    东宾夕法尼亚、特拉华和密执安等地区的共产党组织在给丹尼斯等人的信中一致向他们表示最热烈的祝贺。这些党组织表示要团结更多的人为保卫和平、争取废除史密斯法、反对新的迫害阴谋和维护党的领袖的自由而坚决斗争。不久以前被法院根据“共产党管制法”判处徒刑的共产党伊利诺斯州执行书记莱弗特在给丹尼斯的电报中说：“你们的归来给我们以鼓舞，我们保证要为保卫和平和民主、为保证你们不受第二次的审讯而斗争。”
    美国民权保障大会、俄亥俄州等地区的史密斯法受害者和洛杉矶等地的工人领袖也致电丹尼斯等表示祝贺，并且保证要为维护他们的自由、为保卫和平和民主而斗争
