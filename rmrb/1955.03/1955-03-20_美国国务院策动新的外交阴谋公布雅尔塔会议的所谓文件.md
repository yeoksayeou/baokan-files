Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 19th: TASS reports from New York on March 18th: The U.S. State Department has released more than 800 pages of so-called documents from the Yalta Conference of 1945, attended by the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin. Also participating were the foreign ministers of the three countries, Eden, Stettinius, Molotov, as well as some advisors.

According to the United Press, the released "documents" are actually just "various records, meeting minutes, suggestions submitted to the Yalta Conference, as well as memoirs about the conference afterward, and some records of conversations… The only records of important exchanges of views among the three Allied heads of state are often just notes compiled afterward based on the memory of a translator or secretary." The United Press, quoting U.S. officials themselves, pointed out that "not all documents have been released."

Political figures in New York believe that the release of the so-called "documents" of the Yalta Conference is an action in the struggle between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, an attempt to "sabotage" the late President Roosevelt. At the same time, some also believe that the release of the "documents" is another major step by the State Department in its foreign policy.

The White House (President Eisenhower's Presidential Residence) statement on March 17th attracted attention. According to the Associated Press, the statement specifically pointed out that "President Eisenhower has not studied the Yalta documents," and therefore the decision to release these documents "was taken solely by the State Department" without prior consultation with the President.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 19th: TASS reports from Paris on March 18th: Parisian newspapers have published news of the U.S. State Department's release of so-called documents about the Yalta Conference with great prominence. The newspapers emphasize the parts of these documents that "insult" France.

	"L'Echo" severely criticized Churchill's "anti-French stance" at the Yalta Conference. For example, the newspaper wrote: "Churchill's recent letter to Mendès-France threatening him with the 'empty chair' proves that this veteran advocate of the 'Britain, rule!' principle has not changed his position toward our country, just as Britain's traditional policy in Europe has not changed… What is infuriating about Churchill is that he adopts an insulting position toward us behind our backs, but he embraces the traditional British policy of 'divide and rule.'" "L'Echo" said that under the current circumstances, France can only rely on itself to avoid being despised.

	An Agence France-Presse diplomatic commentator wrote: When the news first came from Washington, it could be confidently asserted that the documents were released for domestic political considerations. However, even if this is only a domestic trick, one cannot help but suspect that the release of such documents may have serious international consequences. The British government is the first to be in an awkward position. Churchill admitted that he had finally yielded to the State Department's insistence and agreed to the release of the documents, and then he did not hide that he was against doing so. He also tried to refute the authenticity of the released documents, which are merely the American version of the facts, with many errors.

	"Le Figaro" pointed out that the decision to release the Yalta documents was not only out of domestic political considerations in the United States. The newspaper believes that British figures also hold the same view, speculating that "this move by the United States may greatly hinder the resumption of negotiations between East and West."

	Moro wrote in "L'Humanité" that Washington wants to use this pile of documents to conduct a diplomatic activity, the purpose of which is obvious. In order to promote the restoration of German militarism and attempt to force the approval of the Paris Accords, which can rebuild the revanchist German armed forces, the United States has broken the obligations it undertook at Yalta. In order to explain that its actions of violating the agreements it also signed are justified, it must destroy the reputation of the Yalta Conference. At the same time, it also hopes to make everyone lose confidence in the concept of negotiation and wants to widely promote another false concept, that easing international tensions is impossible.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 19th: TASS reports from London on March 18th: Almost all British newspapers strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's release of the Yalta "documents," considering it a sign that U.S. foreign policy decision-makers are leaning towards West German and Japanese revanchists.

	"The Times" wrote in an editorial that there can be no doubt that the U.S. government's motives for releasing the Yalta Conference records are bad. The newspaper believes that the U.S. government is doing this to "undermine the prestige of the late President Roosevelt and thereby undermine the prestige of the current leaders of the Democratic Party."

	"The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" also commented on this event in the same tone.

According to Reuters, British Prime Minister Churchill said in the House of Commons on March 17th, referring to the U.S. State Department's "documents": "This is certainly an American record, and not at all a formal record agreed upon by the relevant countries."

Churchill continued, even just browsing the summaries published in the newspapers reveals serious errors.

### 美国国务院策动新的外交阴谋公布雅尔塔会议的所谓文件

    美国国务院策动新的外交阴谋公布雅尔塔会议的所谓文件
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：美国国务院公布了一九四五年在雅尔塔举行的苏、美、英三国首脑会议的八百多页所谓文件。出席雅尔塔会议的是邱吉尔、罗斯福和斯大林，参加这次会议的还有三国的外长艾登、斯退丁纽斯、莫洛托夫以及一些顾问。
    据合众社说，所公布的“文件”实际上只是“各种记录、报告记录、提交雅尔塔会议的各种建议、还有事后关于这次会议的回忆录以及一些谈话记录……盟国三首脑交换重要意见的唯一的记录，往往只是事后根据某个翻译或者是秘书的记忆所编出的扎记。”合众社引用美国官方人士自己的话指出，“并不是所有的文件都公布了”。
    纽约的政界人士认为，公布雅尔塔会议的所谓“文件”是共和党反对民主党的斗争的行动，是企图“拆”故罗斯福总统的“台”。同时，也有人认为公布“文件”是国务院在外交政策上的又一个重大的步骤。
    白宫（艾森豪威尔总统的总统府）三月十七日的声明引起了注意，据美联社说，声明中特别指出，“艾森豪威尔总统没有研究过雅尔塔文件”，因而公布这些文件的决定“是国务院单独采取的”，事先没有和总统商量。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：巴黎报纸以很大的篇幅刊载了美国国务院公布关于雅尔塔会议的所谓文件的消息。各报着重指出这些文件中“侮辱”法国的部分。
      “回声报”严厉抨击邱吉尔在雅尔塔会议上的
  “反法的立场”。例如，这家报纸写道：“邱吉尔不久前给孟戴斯—弗朗斯的以‘空位子’相威胁的信证明，这位老资格的主张‘英国，你统治吧！’的原则的人，并没有改变他对我国的立场，正如英国在欧洲的传统的政策并没有改变一样……邱吉尔使人恼怒的地方是：他在我们背后采取侮辱我们的立场，不过他抱的是英国世世代代传统的‘分而治之’的政策。”“回声报”说，在目前的情况下，法国只有依靠自己才能避免遭到藐视。
    法新社外交评论员写道：当消息从华盛顿初次传来的时候，可以肯定地认为，公布文件是为了内政上的考虑。但是，即使这只是内政上的花招，人们还是不能不怀疑，公布这样的文件可能有严重的国际后果。英国政府就首先处于难堪的地位。邱吉尔承认他终于对国务院的坚持已经作了让步，而同意公布文件，接着他也不掩饰，他是反对这样做的。他还竭力驳斥被公布的文件的确实性，这些文件只是美国对事实的说法，其中并有许多错误。
        “费加罗报”指出，决定公布雅尔塔文件不仅是出于美国内政上的考虑。报纸认为，英国人士也具有同样的看法，他们推测，“美国的这一手可能使恢复东、西方的谈判大加困难。”
    摩罗在“人道报”上写道，华盛顿想利用这一堆文件来进行一种外交活动，这种活动的目的是显而易见的。美国为了促使恢复德国军国主义，企图强迫批准能重建复仇主义的德国国防军的巴黎协定，它破坏了它在雅尔塔承担的义务。美国为了想说明它破坏它也签过字的协定的行为是正当的，它必须要毁坏雅尔塔会议的声誉，同时它还希望使大家对谈判这一个概念失去信任，并且想把另一种虚假的概念广为宣传，即和缓国际紧张局势是不可能的。
     【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦十八日讯：几乎英国所有的报纸都强烈指责美国国务院公布雅尔塔“文件”，认为这是美国外交政策决策人靠向西德和日本复仇分子的一个标志。
      “泰晤士报”在社论中写道，美国政府公布雅尔塔会议记录的动机是不良的，这一点不能有什么怀疑。这家报纸认为，美国政府这样做是为了“破坏已故的罗斯福总统的威信，并藉此来破坏民主党现在的领袖的威信”。
    “每日电讯与晨邮报”也以同样的笔调评论了这一事件。
    据路透社报道，英国首相邱吉尔十七日在下院发言谈到美国国务院的“文件”时说：“这当然是美国的记录，而完全不是有关国家一致同意的正式记录。”
    邱吉尔接着说，甚至只要浏览一下报纸上刊载的摘要，就可以看出其中的严重错误。
