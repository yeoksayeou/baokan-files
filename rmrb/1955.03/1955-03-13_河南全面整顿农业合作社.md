Henan Comprehensively Rectifies Agricultural Cooperatives

The Party committees at all levels in Henan Province have organized 20,000 cadres to go to the countryside to rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.

Agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province have developed to more than 40,000, not only with cooperatives in every district, but also in 73.5% of the townships. However, due to the blind expansion and poor management of some old cooperatives, and the insufficient preparation, sloppy work, and inadequate ideological mobilization of many newly established cooperatives, as well as the incomplete implementation of class policies and other deviations, there are relatively serious phenomena of instability. In February, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Fourth Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference, analyzed and studied this situation, and focused on resolving the issue of how to rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. This time, a large number of cadres were drawn to form work teams led by leading comrades of the Party committee, who went deep into various districts and townships, demanding that the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives promote the entire spring production work.

    河南全面整顿农业合作社
    河南省各级党委组织两万名干部下乡整顿和巩固农业生产合作社。
    河南省农业生产合作社已发展到四万多个，不仅区区有社，而且在百分之七十三点五的乡内有了社。但由于部分老社的盲目扩大和经营管理不善，和不少新建社的准备不足，工作粗糙以及思想发动不充足，阶级政策贯彻不全面等偏向，以致存在着比较严重的不巩固现象。二月间，中共河南省委召开第四次互助合作会议，对这种情况进行了分析研究，并集中地解决了如何整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的问题。这次抽调大批干部组成由党委领导同志亲自率领的工作队，深入各个区乡，要求通过整顿与巩固合作社的工作把整个春季生产工作推动起来。（本报郑州记者）
