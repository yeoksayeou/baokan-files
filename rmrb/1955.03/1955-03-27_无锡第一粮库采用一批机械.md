    Wuxi First Grain Depot Adopts a Batch of Machinery
    Wuxi City is known throughout the country as one of the four major rice markets, and a large amount of grain produced in the Taihu Lake Basin is gathered and distributed here. In 1950, in order to meet the needs of grain transportation and storage work here, the People's Government built the First Warehouse of the Wuxi Municipal Grain Bureau in a pile of rubble. Later, the capacity of the warehouse was expanded.
    With the assistance of the Soviet Union, this grain depot has initially embarked on the road of mechanized grain storage. In this grain depot, there are already more than 20 conveyors, dryers and grain cleaning machines transported from the Soviet Union or manufactured in the Soviet style. Using these machines to reduce grain moisture, remove grain impurities, and transport grain makes grain storage work more scientific and reduces the heavy physical labor of workers in turning, drying, and transporting grain. The recently started conveyor alone can transport more than 60,000 jin of grain per hour, which is equivalent to the workload of fifty laborers.

    无锡第一粮库采用一批机械
    无锡市以四大米市之一闻名全国，太湖流域出产的大量食粮都在这里集散。一九五零年人民政府为了适应这里粮食运输和保管工作的需要，在一片瓦砾中建造了无锡市粮食局第一仓库。后来，又扩大了仓库的容量。
    在苏联的援助下，这个粮库已初步走上了机械化保粮的道路。在这个粮库里，已经有二十多部从苏联运来或仿照苏联式样制造的输送机、烘干机和净粮机。用这些机器来降低粮食水分，去除粮食杂质和搬运粮食，便使粮食保管工作更加科学化，并且减少了工人们翻晒、运输等笨重的体力劳动。仅最近开车的一部输送机，每小时就可以输送粮食六万多斤，等于五十个劳动力的工作量。
