    Stalin on National Independence of All Peoples
    By No. Shevlyugina, Soviet Union
    Marxism-Leninism (the doctrine of scientific communism) firmly opposes any oppression, whether social, political, or national. In the works of Marx and Engels, and Lenin and Stalin, the national colonial question occupies an important position and is an integral part of the general question of liberating working people from all forms of oppression and exploitation.

    Marxism refutes the pseudo-scientific argument that divides people into so-called "superior nations" and "inferior nations," and the nonsense that the world is inevitably divided into higher and lower races. This argument claims that the so-called "inferior races" cannot approach civilization and should be exploited by the "superior races," who are supposedly the sole representatives of civilization. Marxism-Leninism explains the backwardness of some nations not by the biological or racial characteristics of a nation, but by the conditions in which that nation developed, namely, national colonial oppression, the deliberate obstruction of the economic, political, and cultural development of oppressed nations by colonizers, and the inhuman exploitation and humiliation suffered by oppressed nations for centuries.

    The fundamental interests of mankind require the elimination of colonial and national oppression, and a relentless struggle against the policy of one nation enslaving other nations, against situations where some nations have various priorities and privileges while others are subject to various restrictions.

    The brilliant Marxist theoretician, the founder and leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the founder of the Soviet socialist state, V.I. Lenin, repeatedly mentioned this sentence by Marx and Engels: A nation that oppresses other nations cannot be free. Lenin taught that the interests of the working people require opposition to the policy of national oppression, because this policy does not benefit the people of the nation that is the oppressor, but only the ruling class.

    Lenin formulated the program of the Marxist party on the national question. This program proclaimed the equality of all nations, the right of nations to self-determination, and the protection of the rights of minority nationalities. The draft program of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, drafted by V.I. Lenin in 1902, stipulated that all nations in Russia have the right to national self-determination. Lenin called this principle a basic principle of democracy. Lenin said that the issue of political self-determination of a nation, that is, the issue of their national separation, should be completely free and democratic. At the same time, wherever there is a forced connection between nations, it is necessary to insist that each nation has the right to self-determination. Lenin taught that all nations are familiar with the significance of economic ties and the superiority of large countries, therefore, in a situation where national oppression hinders their economic and political development and makes people's lives painfully unbearable, they cannot but strive to separate themselves.

    Lenin's programmatic instructions on the national question were creatively developed in the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in the works of the great successor to Lenin's cause, J.V. Stalin, and were realized in the Soviet Union.

    In late 1912 and early 1913, J.V. Stalin wrote "Marxism and the National Question." In this work, he explained the Communist Party's program on the national question and further developed the Marxist theory of the national question.

    After the Great October Revolution that solved the national question in Russia, J.V. Stalin, based on the theory of V.I. Lenin, the program and strategy of the Communist Party, and the experience of the Soviet Union, enriched the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the national colonial question in his later works. The idea that all nations have equal rights and that it is necessary to unswervingly fight for national independence runs through all of J.V. Stalin's works.

    In his article "Marxism and the National Question," J.V. Stalin gave a very clear and scientifically based definition of a nation. "A nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, a common territory, a common economic life, and a common psychological make-up manifested in a common culture." ("The Complete Works of Stalin," Chinese edition, Vol. 2, p. 294)

    In the same work, J.V. Stalin elaborated on the principle of national self-determination formulated by Lenin—the basic principle of the Communist Party on the national question. "The right to self-determination means that a nation can manage its own affairs according to its own wishes. It has the right to arrange its life according to the principle of autonomy. It has the right to establish federal relations with other nations. It has the right to separate completely. Every nation is autonomous, and all nations are equal."
    (Ibid., pp. 306-307)

    J.V. Stalin also said: "The Soviet people believe that every nation, regardless of its size, has its own essential characteristics and particularities that belong only to it and not to other nations. These characteristics are the contribution of each nation to the common treasury of world culture, supplementing it and enriching it. In this sense, all nations, regardless of size, are on an equal footing, and each nation is equal to any other nation." (Stalin: "Marxism and the National Colonial Question," p. 381)

    In the Soviet Union, the national question was resolved on the basis of mutual trust and fraternal closeness between the workers and peasants of all nations. J.V. Stalin emphasized that the Soviet Republic did not absorb other nations into its republic by coercive means, but through voluntary agreement. This republic demonstrated by facts that neither direct nor indirect coercion of other nations is compatible with the unity and fraternal alliance of the working people. The various peoples of Russia who had been granted the right to separate entered into agreements with the young Russian Soviet Federal Republic. These agreements led the Soviet peoples to national unification and the formation of a unified union state. The Soviet Union is an alliance voluntarily formed by a number of free, equal, and mutually respected nations. For the first time in human history, previously oppressed and enslaved nations have risen to become truly free and equal nations.

    The Constitution of the Soviet Union, which was directly participated in by J.V. Stalin and endorsed by the people, consolidated the achievements of the new society created in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Constitution is based on the principles of national friendship and equality formulated by V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin, and on the realistic achievements of the Soviet people. In the Soviet Union, all nations and races have equal rights. Differences in skin color or language, in cultural level or national development, like any other differences between nations and races, cannot be a reason for inequality in national rights. All nationalities in the Soviet Union enjoy equal rights in all spheres of social, economic, state, and cultural life.

    The Leninist-Stalinist doctrine of national self-determination is also the foundation of the Soviet state's foreign policy. In the early days of its establishment, the Soviet state declared the sovereign equality of all countries and nations and condemned national inequality and colonial oppression.

    The working people of colonial and semi-colonial countries will always regard the Soviet Union as their true friend. The Soviet people have always sympathized with and still sympathize with those nations engaged in liberation struggles against colonialists and imperialist aggressors, and wish all oppressed nations complete victory in their liberation struggles.

    斯大林论各族人民的民族独立
    苏联  诺·谢伏留吉娜
    马克思列宁主义（科学共产主义的学说）对于任何一种压迫，不论是社会的和政治的压迫还是民族的压迫，都是坚决反对的。在马克思和恩格斯以及列宁和斯大林的著作里，民族殖民地问题占有很重要的地位，并且是使劳动人民摆脱各种压迫和剥削的总问题的一个组成部分。
    马克思主义驳斥了把人区分为所谓“优秀民族”和“劣等民族”的伪科学论调，也驳斥了说世界不可避免地要分为高等种族和下等种族的谰言，这种论调认为所谓的“下等种族”无法接近文明并应该成为“高等种族”的剥削对象，而“高等种族”似乎是文明的唯一代表者。马克思列宁主义不是用某一民族在生物学或种族上的特点，而是用该民族发展所处的条件，即用民族殖民地压迫、殖民者蓄意阻挠被压迫民族的经济、政治和文化发展以及在数百年间被压迫民族所受的惨无人性的剥削和屈辱的事实来说明一些民族落后的原因。
    人类的根本利益，要求消灭殖民压迫和民族压迫，要求为反对一个民族奴役其他民族的政策，反对一些民族具有各种优先权和特权，而另一些民族则受到各种限制的状况而展开无情的斗争。
    天才的马克思主义理论家，苏联共产党的缔造者和领袖，苏维埃社会主义国家的奠基者弗·伊·列宁，曾屡次提及马克思和恩格斯所说的这一句话：压迫其他民族的民族，不可能是自由的。列宁教导说，劳动人民的利益，要求反对民族压迫政策。因为这种政策对作为压迫者的民族的人民来说，并没有好处，只是对统治阶级有利。
    列宁制订了马克思主义政党关于民族问题的纲领。这个纲领宣布各民族平权，民族有自决权，保护少数民族的权利。一九○二年弗·伊·列宁所拟的俄国社会民主工党党纲草案，就规定俄罗斯一切民族都有民族自决权。列宁把这个原则称为民主的基本原则。列宁说过，决定民族在政治上自决问题，也就是他们的国家分立问题，应该是完全自由的和民主的，同时，凡是在各民族之间有强制联系的地方，都必须坚持使每一民族有权自决。列宁教导说，各族人民都熟知经济联系的意义和大国的优越性，因此，在民族压迫阻碍着他们的经济和政治发展使人民的生活痛苦难堪的情况下，他们不能不力求分离出去。
    列宁关于民族问题的纲领式的指示，在苏联共产党的决议中，在列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林的著作中，得到了创造性的发展并在苏联获得实现。
    在一九一二年底至一九一三年初，约·维·斯大林写了“马克思主义和民族问题”的著作。在这一著作中，他说明了共产党关于民族问题的纲领，并进一步发展了马克思主义民族问题的理论。
    在解决了俄国的民族问题的伟大十月革命以后，约·维·斯大林根据弗·伊·列宁的理论、共产党的纲领和策略以及苏联的经验，在他后来的一些著作中，丰富了马克思列宁主义关于民族殖民地问题的学说。在约·维·斯大林的所有著作中，都贯串着各民族有平等权利以及必须坚持不渝地为争取民族独立而斗争的思想。
    约·维·斯大林在他的“马克思主义和民族问题”一文中给民族下了一个极明确和具有科学根据的定义。“民族是人们在历史上形成的一个有共同语言、共同地域、共同经济生活以及表现于共同文化上的共同心理素质的稳定的共同体。”（“斯大林全集”第二卷中文版第二九四页）
    约·维·斯大林在同一著作中阐述了列宁所制定的民族自决原则——共产党在民族问题上的基本原则。“自决权就是民族能按照自己的愿望去处理自己的事情。它有权按自治原则安排自己的生活。它有权和其他民族建立联邦关系。它有权完全分离出去。每个民族都是自主的，一切民族都是平等的。”
  （同前，第三○六—三○七页）
    约·维·斯大林并说：“苏维埃人认为：每一个民族，不论其大小，都有它自己的、只属于它而为其他民族所没有的本质上的特点、特殊性。这些特点便是每一民族在世界文化共同宝库中所增添的贡献，补充了它，丰富了它。在这个意义上，一切民族，不论大小，都处于同等的地位，每个民族都是与其他任何民族平等的。”（斯大林：“马克思主义与民族、殖民地问题”第三八一页）
    在苏联，民族问题是在各民族的工人和农民相互信任和兄弟般亲密的基础上予以解决的。约·维·斯大林强调指出，苏维埃共和国不是用强制手段，而是通过自愿的协议，吸收其他民族来加入自己的共和国。这个共和国用事实表明，不论是对其他民族的直接或间接的强迫，都是同劳动人民的团结和兄弟般的联盟不相容的。得到了分立权的俄国各族人民同年轻的俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国订立了协议。这些协议促使苏维埃各族人民走向了国家联合，组成统一的联盟国家。苏联是一个由一些自由、平等和互相尊重的民族自愿结合的联盟。在人类史上，以前被压迫的民族，受奴役的民族，第一次上升为真正自由和平等的民族。
    由约·维·斯大林直接参加制订，并为人民所拥护的苏联宪法，巩固了在苏联所创立的新社会的成果。苏联宪法是以弗·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林所制定的关于民族友好和平权的原则，以苏联人民的现实成就为出发点的。在苏联，所有的民族和种族都有平等权利。肤色或语言的不同，文化水平或国家发展的差别，也正像民族间和种族间的其他任何差别一样，不能成为民族权利不平等的理由。苏联各民族在社会的经济生活、国家生活和文化生活等一切领域中，都享有同样的权利。
    列宁斯大林关于民族自决权的学说也是苏维埃国家对外政策的基础。苏维埃国家在建立的初期，就宣布了所有国家和民族的主权平等，并谴责了民族的不平等和殖民压迫。
    殖民地和半殖民地的劳动人民永远把苏联看作是自己的真实朋友。苏联人民无论过去和现在都对那些进行解放斗争以反对殖民者和帝国主义侵略者的民族寄予同情，并祝各被压迫民族在解放斗争中取得完全的胜利。
