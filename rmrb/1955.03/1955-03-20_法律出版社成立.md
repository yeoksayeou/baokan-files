    Founding of the Law Publishing House
    The Law Publishing House was established in Beijing on March 18th.
    The main tasks of the Law Publishing House are: relying on various departments of politics and law, various colleges and universities, and organizing and contacting social translation and writing forces to compile and publish books on Marxist-Leninist theory and historical research on state and law; to compile and publish books on the theory and practice of political and legal work; to compile or publish laws, decrees and related reference materials; to compile and publish teaching materials for political and legal colleges and universities; to compile and publish popular readings on state and law; and to publish journals on state and law.
    According to the plan, this year, in addition to publishing my country's existing important laws, decrees and related popular readings, it will also translate and publish some important Soviet codes and basic readings on national law, as well as reference books on political and legal work and systems. The first batch of books published by the Law Publishing House will soon meet the readers. (Wei)
