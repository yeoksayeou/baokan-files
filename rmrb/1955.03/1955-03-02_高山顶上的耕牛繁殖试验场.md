On "Yuan Ding Zi" in Bazhong County, Sichuan Province, a high mountain area of over ten thousand acres, which was originally a wilderness of old forests and wild animals, the People's Government sent staff in 1952 to work with the local people to drive away the wild animals, clear away the thorns and weeds, and build cattle sheds in Taoshu Ping and Mazhuo Shi, where there was sufficient water and sunshine, and established a cattle breeding experimental farm. This experimental farm initially only had two Dutch breeding cattle, but now it has increased and bred more than four hundred cattle. The workers use advanced artificial insemination methods, which can make fifteen to twenty cows pregnant at a time. The calves produced are fat and strong, weighing thirty-five to forty catties at birth.

With the breeding of cattle, the farm has also begun to reclaim wasteland. They used the fat cattle to pull new-style plows and reclaimed more than two hundred acres of wasteland. The wheat and Soviet "alfalfa" and "red leaf" forage grasses planted on the newly reclaimed land are growing very well. (Reported by our Chongqing reporter)

    高山顶上的耕牛繁殖试验场
    四川巴中县“圆顶子”的方圆十几万亩的高山上，原是一片荒山老林、野兽出没的地方。一九五二年，人民政府派来工作人员，配合当地群众赶跑了野兽，铲除了荆棘野草，在水源和阳光充足的桃树坪和麻啄石，修起了牛舍，建立了耕牛繁殖试验场。这个试验场，当初只有两只荷兰种牛，可是现在已增加和繁殖了四百多只耕牛了。工人们采用先进的人工授精法，一次可使十五只到二十只母牛受孕。所产小牛又肥又壮，生下后就有三十五到四十斤重。
    随着耕牛的繁殖，牛场又开始开垦荒地。他们用肥壮的耕牛套上新式步?，开垦了二百多亩荒地，在新荒地上种植的小麦和苏联“苜蓿”“红叶”等牧草，都长得很好。（本报重庆记者讯）
