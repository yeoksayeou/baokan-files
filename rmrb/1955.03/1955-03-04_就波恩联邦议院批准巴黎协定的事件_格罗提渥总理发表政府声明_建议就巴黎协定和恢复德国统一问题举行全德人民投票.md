Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 3rd: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on March 2nd. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, issued a government statement at the meeting regarding the Bonn Bundestag's ratification of the Paris Agreement. In his statement, Grotewohl proposed holding an all-German referendum on the Paris Agreement and the reunification of Germany.

Grotewohl emphasized that the Bonn Bundestag's ratification of the Paris Agreement, against the will of the majority of the German people, was an act of betrayal. The Bundestag's debate proved that Adenauer and his coalition group hoped to finally remove the question of Germany's peaceful reunification from the agenda by ratifying the Paris Agreement and opening the road to war.

Grotewohl spoke about the situation after the ratification of the Paris Agreement, saying that West Germany would obtain the right to establish new "Defense Forces" and possess heavy equipment and atomic weapons. Former Hitler generals would command the troops, and West Germany would become a member of the so-called "Western European Union" within the North Atlantic Group, serving American world hegemony. This is utterly incompatible with the German people's desire for peace.

Grotewohl reiterated that the Paris Agreement is the main obstacle to resolving the German problem because it makes Germany's reunification impossible for a long time. He pointed out that the Paris Agreement means the loss of West Germany's sovereignty, Germany's permanent division, and the continued existence of the occupation regime in West Germany. The Paris Agreement will promote the deepening of Europe's division, lead to the establishment of hostile blocs, and ultimately lead to war.

Grotewohl reaffirmed the importance of reaching an all-German agreement. He pointed out that as long as the working class of West Germany and the German Democratic Republic unite and fight together with the working people of other classes, the Paris Agreement will certainly be cancelled, and the Adenauer government will certainly fall.

Grotewohl continued, the government of the German Democratic Republic declares that it will never recognize the Paris Agreement. The Bonn Bundestag ratified the Paris Agreement against the will of the German people. Therefore, this agreement is invalid. It can be asserted that the struggle surrounding the Paris Agreement in Germany and other European countries is far from over. The struggle for peace and security continues. In order to confirm this clearly expressed will of the entire German people, we propose: to hold a referendum in the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic, according to the "German Declaration" passed in Frankfurt am Main. We ask the people: "Do you advocate the peaceful reunification of Germany through all-German elections held in 1955 and approve the 'German Declaration'? Or do you approve the Paris military agreement?"

In order to ensure that the referendum is not obstructed, Grotewohl suggested: that freedom of speech be guaranteed in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic during the secret ballot, that freedom of propaganda and agitation be guaranteed for all democratic parties, trade unions, social groups, and churches in both parts of Germany, that the personal inviolability of representatives of all parties and social groups be guaranteed, that freedom of movement be guaranteed for citizens of both parts of Germany throughout Germany, and other related freedoms.

Grotewohl specifically stated that the German Democratic Republic does not object to international supervision during the all-German referendum, if the Federal Republic deems it necessary.

Grotewohl said: The German Democratic Republic is willing to consider and discuss any suggestions made by the West German Bundestag regarding the conditions for holding an all-German referendum. If the majority of the Bundestag disagrees with holding a referendum, then the democratic parties and groups in the Federal Republic must jointly take the initiative to organize this all-German referendum. He said: "The national disaster requires the German people and democratic groups and organizations to take the highest and final expression of democratic will - a referendum."

Grotewohl finally called on all peace-loving Germans to unite and strive to reach an agreement to abolish the deadly Paris Agreement.

    就波恩联邦议院批准巴黎协定的事件
    格罗提渥总理发表政府声明
    建议就巴黎协定和恢复德国统一问题举行全德人民投票
    【新华社柏林三日电】德意志民主共和国人民议院三月二日举行会议。德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥在会上就波恩联邦议院批准巴黎协定发表了政府的声明。格罗提渥在声明中建议就巴黎协定和恢复德国统一问题举行全德人民投票。
    格罗提渥着重说，波恩联邦议院违背大多数德国人民的意志批准巴黎协定，是背叛国家的行为。联邦议院的辩论证明了，阿登纳和他的联盟集团希望通过批准巴黎协定，最后从议程上抹掉德国和平统一的问题，开辟走向战争的道路。
    格罗提渥谈到巴黎协定批准后的局势说，西德将获得建立新的“国防军”并拥有重型装备和原子武器的权利，统率军队的将是前希特勒将领，西德将成为为美国世界霸权服务的北大西洋集团中所谓“西欧联盟”的成员。这是与德国人民的和平意愿绝不相容的。
    格罗提渥再次强调巴黎协定是解决德国问题的主要障碍，因为它在长时期内使德国恢复统一成为不可能。他指出巴黎协定意味着西德丧失主权、德国陷于永久的分裂和西德占领制度的继续存在。巴黎协定将促使欧洲分裂的加深，导致建立敌对性的集团，结果是导致战争。
    格罗提渥重申达成全德协议的重要性。他指出，只要西德和德意志民主共和国的工人阶级同其他各阶层的劳动人民一致行动起来进行斗争，那末巴黎协定就一定会取消，阿登纳政府就一定会倒台。
    格罗提渥接着说，德意志民主共和国政府宣布：它永远不承认巴黎协定。波恩联邦议院是违背了德国人民的意志而批准了巴黎协定的。因此这一协定是没有效力的。可以断言：在德国和欧洲其他国家，围绕巴黎协定而进行的斗争还远远没有结束。为和平和安全而进行的斗争还在继续进行。为了证实全德人民这种明白表示的意志，我们建议：根据在美因河畔的法兰克福通过的“德国宣言”在联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国举行人民投票。我们问问人民：“你们主张通过在一九五五年举行全德选举的办法来和平恢复德国的统一和赞成‘德国宣言’呢？还是赞成巴黎军事协定？”
    为了使人民投票不受阻挠，格罗提渥建议：在秘密投票期间在德意志民主共和国和联邦共和国保证言论自由，保证德国两部分各民主党派、工会、社会团体和教会进行宣传鼓动的自由，保证各党派和社会团体的代表人身不可侵犯，保证德国两部分公民在全德境内来往自由以及其他有关的各项自由。
    格罗提渥特别声明，德意志民主共和国并不反对在进行全德人民投票时，实行国际监督，如果联邦共和国认为必要的话。
    格罗提渥说：德意志民主共和国愿意考虑和讨论西德联邦议院就举行全德人民投票的条件所提出的任何建议。如果联邦议院的多数不同意举行人民投票，那末联邦共和国的各民主党派和团体必须共同采取主动来组织这次全德人民投票。他说：“民族的灾难要求德国人民和民主团体和组织采取最高的和最后的表现民主意志的方式——人民投票。”
    格罗提渥最后号召全体爱好和平的德国人团结起来，争取达成协议以废除致命的巴黎协定。
