    To Fulfill the National Plan
    ——An Account of Reed-Threading Worker Su Huilian
    Wang Jianlou
    On my first day at the Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, I heard many people say: Su Huilian is a mother of four children, but she hasn't been absent from work all year round, hasn't produced a single bad beam in two years, has consistently overfulfilled her production quota, and is truly a good mother, an excellent Communist Party member, and a model reed-threading worker.
    Su Huilian is of medium height, with a ruddy, round face, and a sturdy build. She is twenty-eight years old this year, and with her husband, mother, and four children, a family of seven, life is really good for her! Her old home is in Luoyang, Henan. She lost her father at the age of four, and with no one to rely on, she followed her mother begging for food in Xi'an. In the old society, she really suffered. Landlords smashed her begging bowl, trampled her begging basket, and beat her legs. She entered a yarn factory as a worker at the age of eight, living a life of hunger and cold. She remembers all this in her heart. She often says, "We, who have been liberated, must strive to increase production every day." In recent years, she has indeed been working with more and more energy.
    She is truly a diligent and good mother. She gets up early every day, sweeps the floor and wipes the table, tidying up the three small rooms neatly before going to work. She studies culture whenever she has some free time, or sews and mends for the children, washing and cleaning, making the children look spotless. She says, "By taking care of things at home, I won't have to worry about them when I'm at the workshop." Since liberation, she has consistently been at the forefront of production. In 1952, she was named a Northwest Regional Labor Model, and in the same year, she honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Last year, she created a complete set of reed-threading work methods and was selected as a Class A Labor Model and a Class A Learning Model.
    One afternoon, I went to her house. Just as I was about to step into the gate, I heard Huilian speaking inside: "Mom! Pour this bottle of milk into the small pot and boil it. Sister Liu's baby has no milk to drink and is about to cry himself to death!" An old lady said slowly, "Look at you, Changpo's stomach is so bad that he hasn't even eaten, and you're giving the milk to someone else's child. What will he drink when he comes back?" Huilian said, "Boil it, Mom! Changpo is an adult!" The old lady muttered, making a "clang, clang" sound with the small pot. From the sound, you could tell the old lady wasn't very happy. Huilian explained, "Mom, are our children made of flesh, and other people's children made of iron? Sister Liu is sick, how can we not take care of her baby?" Huilian came out of the house and invited me into the inner room.
    After sitting for a while, I said with a smile, "Comrade Huilian, please tell me the story of creating the reed-threading work method!" She blushed and said, "What can I say? This is all the result of the Party's leadership and the enthusiastic help of comrades. What I have done is just some ordinary things." But at my request, she finally sat on the kang, brushed her hair back, and began to speak.
    She said that in the past, reed-threading work didn't have a fixed method. People did whatever they wanted, and no one had any confidence, just busy all day long. When the Party called for "increasing production and practicing economy," she put her heart and soul into production. But at first, she only knew how to exert force, and she was so tired all day long that her arms and back hurt, but the quota wasn't raised much. She thought that relying on strength alone wasn't a long-term solution, and improving technology and operations was the goal. Later, she started by examining technical operations and discovered that she often had empty needles when threading the heddles. Threading an empty needle easily caused a thread break, and joining a thread meant threading a dozen fewer reeds. Sometimes, if the inspection wasn't strict enough, after threading a long section, she would discover an empty reed eye or a missing end, and she would have to dismantle everything and start all over again, which wasted a lot of time. At this time, she remembered the story of "The Tortoise and the Hare" told by the Party branch secretary. Our workers, when rushing to meet the plan, should be patient and calm, and steadily move forward, not be impatient and arrogant like the hare. She also thought: To improve the quality of production, one must master the technology and also seize the time. So she used her thumb, index finger, and middle finger together to keep the distance between the hook and the heddle eye consistent, hitting the mark with each thread, and rarely having empty needles. She also strengthened the inspection work, looking back after threading a few lines to reduce rework. When mounting the beam, she arranged the beam frame while checking the steel heddles, arranging the heddle strips, heddle wires, and heddle eyes neatly and rationally, and seizing the time in every small movement. In this way, she wasn't tired, production was high, and the quality was good. The leadership helped summarize the experience and promoted it in the workshop, and production efficiency generally increased by about 30%. But later, when learning to thread drop wires, her operation became unaccustomed. She was exhausted all day long, only threading two beams. Later, she found that Comrade Hu Xiuzhi held the steel pieces steadily, while she couldn't hold them steadily and was flustered when threading the heddles, so she humbly learned from her, and her output quickly increased from two to more than five, and sometimes even more than six.
    Once, she produced two bad beams in a row, and she felt very uncomfortable. She asked to make a self-criticism at the meeting. The responsible comrade said, "Self-criticism alone won't solve the problem. The main thing is to investigate the causes of the bad beams." After work, she didn't even eat dinner, sitting on the kang to study, looking for the cause, and thinking all night before she found the root cause and the solution. She did as she thought, and sure enough, she didn't produce a bad beam for several months. The leadership again helped summarize the experience and promoted it in the workshop. But some comrades said that her method was too troublesome and delayed production. At first, even she thought so. Later, she heard the beam-pushing workers in the cloth shop say, "Recently, Huilian's beams have improved. It only takes twenty minutes to mount one beam, while in the past, some took forty minutes!" This encouraged her. She thought: If I spend two or three more minutes tidying up, the beam-pushers in the cloth shop will save twenty minutes. If we only pursue output without paying attention to quality, and the cloth shop takes twenty minutes more to mount a beam, how much less cloth will the cloth shop weave in a year? If the supply department doesn't strongly support the cloth shop, how can the whole factory comprehensively overfulfill the national plan? So she insisted on both increasing output and paying attention to quality.
    Sun Cuiying and Sun Yuzhen in the workshop produced two bad beams in a row. They were both very distressed and didn't speak at the meeting. Huilian thought: We workers are all the same. If we don't complete the national plan, everyone will feel bad. Criticism alone won't solve the problem. We need to provide more technical assistance. So she took the initiative to tell them the importance of improving quality and taught them how to improve quality. They thought it made sense and did as she said. Sure enough, they didn't produce a bad beam in a quarter, and the whole group was honorably named a winner group.
    "You are a mother of four children. You haven't missed a single day of work all year round, and you haven't missed a class at the spare-time school. This is really not easy! Have you encountered any difficulties in the middle?" I asked again.
    "Having children is more troublesome! But you can't not participate in production every now and then for the sake of the children. Otherwise, what kind of New China woman would I be?" she said. Once, her fourth child had chickenpox and a high fever, crying every night until dawn. At this critical moment, Changpo's stomach disease flared up again. She had to sit and hold the child until dawn, and then go to work, her body was exhausted. At this moment, she really wanted to take a leave of absence, but she thought, "The factory's production is so tense. If I take a day off, the deputy will also take a day off. If no one operates the frames, how will the group complete the national plan? If the beams aren't supplied, the cloth shop will have to stop work and wait for materials. How can the national plan be completed? Besides, I am a Communist Party member. Just sitting and holding the child, without trying to create happiness for the child, what am I?" So she told the nanny about the child's condition, and they promised to take care of her child. She went to work with peace of mind. Huilian stopped talking, took a sip of water, and finally said, "I am able to work methodically because of the credit of the nursery! They take care of my children better than I do myself. How can I not work and study with peace of mind? But as a Communist Party member, I really feel that what I have done in the past is still too little!"

    为了完成国家计划
    ——记穿筘女工苏蕙莲
    王建楼
    到陕西第一棉纺织厂的头一天，我就听到好些人说：苏蕙莲是个四个孩子的母亲，但一年到头没缺勤，两年没出过一个坏轴，一贯超额完成产量计划，真正是一个好母亲，优秀的共产党员，模范的穿筘女工。
    苏蕙莲是个中等个儿，红红的圆脸，身体结结实实。她今年二十八岁，丈夫、母亲和四个娃，一家七口，日子过的可真好啦！她老家住在河南洛阳，四岁上死了父亲，生活没指靠，就跟着母亲讨饭到西安。在旧社会，她可真够苦的了，地主砸碎过她的讨饭碗，踏烂过她的讨饭筐，打过她的双腿；她八岁进纱厂当工人，一直过着挨饿受冻的日子。这一切，她都铭记在心里，她常说：“我们翻了身的人要争取每天多多增产。”这几年来，她的确越干越有劲了。
    她真是一个勤劳的好母亲，每天早早起来，扫地揩桌，把三间小屋拾掇的整整齐齐才上班。她有点空就学文化，要不就给孩子缝这补那，洗东擦西，把孩子们弄得干干净净。她说：“把家里的事情办妥贴，到车间就不再挂念家中的事了。”解放以来，她在生产上，一贯跑在头前，一九五二年她被评为西北区劳动模范，同年又光荣地加入了中国共产党。去年她创造了一套完整的穿筘工作法，被选为甲等劳动模范和甲等学习模范。
    一天下午，我到她家里去，正要迈步进大门，就听到蕙莲在屋里说话：“妈！拿这瓶牛奶倒入小锅煮了吧，刘嫂子的娃没奶吃快哭毁啦！”一位老太太慢腾腾地说：“看你这个人，长坡胃病重的连饭都没吃，牛奶给别人小孩吃了，他回来喝西北风呀？”蕙莲又说：“煮吧，妈！长坡是大人嘛！”老太太嘟嘟囔囔，把小锅敲得“咣咣”响，从声音里可听出老太太不大高兴。蕙莲又解释说：“妈，咱们孩子是肉做的，别人孩子是铁打的？刘嫂子病了，她的娃咱们怎能不管呢？”蕙莲从屋里出来，招呼我到里屋去。
    坐了一会，我笑着说：“蕙莲同志，请你讲讲创造穿筘工作法的故事吧！”她脸红起来说道：“我说啥？这都是党的领导，同志们热心帮助的结果，我所做的不过是些平常事。”但在我的要求下，她终于坐到炕头上，把头发往后一甩，讲起来了。
    她说，过去穿筘工作没有一定的操作方法，爱怎么着就怎么着，谁心里也没底，一天穷忙一气。当党号召“增产节约”时，她就把心全拴到生产上。但起初光会拚力气，整天累的膀痛腰酸，定额还是提高不多，她想光凭力气不是长远办法，改进技术、改进操作才是目标。后来她就从检查技术操作着眼，果然发现自己在穿综时，常发生有空针的现象。一穿空针就容易断头，接一个头要少穿十几个筘。有时检查不严，穿了好长一节，才发现有空筘眼或漏头，结果又全拆了，从头再来，这就浪费了好些时间。这时，她想起党支部书记讲的“龟兔赛跑”的故事来。咱们工人赶计划，应当耐心、沉着，稳稳当当地赶，不要像兔子那样急躁骄傲。她又想：提高产量质量就要掌握技术，还要抓紧时间。于是她把拇指、食指、中指并用，使钩针和综眼距离一致，一穿就中，很少有穿空针了。她又加强检查工作，捣几根线就回头看一看，减少了返工。在上轴时，她一边布置轴架，一边检查钢综，把综条、综丝、综眼排列整齐合理，在每小节动作上也都抓紧时间。这样一来，又不累，产量又高，质量还好。领导上帮助总结经验，在车间里推广，生产效率普遍提高百分之三十左右。但后来学习穿带停经片时，她的操作就不习惯了，一天累的要命，才穿上两个多轴。后来她发现忽秀枝同志拿钢片稳，自己拿不稳，穿综又慌张，就虚心向她学习，产量很快的由两个多提高到五个多，有时还穿六个多呢。
    有一次，她连出两个坏轴，心里非常难受，就要求让她在大会上检讨。负责同志说：“光检讨不济事，主要是多检查造成坏轴的原因。”下班后，她连饭也没吃，坐到炕上就钻，找原因，想了一夜，才把根子和办法找出来。她照着所想的办法做，果然一连几个月没出坏轴。领导上又帮助总结经验，在车间里推广。但有的同志说她这办法太麻烦，耽误产量。起初连她也这么想，后来听到布场推轴工说：“最近蕙莲的轴好上了，上一个轴只要二十分钟，过去有的要四十分哩！”这可鼓励了她。她想：我多花两三分钟整理，布场上轴就少费二十分钟，要光追求产量，不讲究质量，布场上一个轴多二十分钟，一年布场要少织多少布？供应部门不大力支持布场，全厂怎样能全面超额完成国家计划？于是就坚持既赶产量，又重视质量。
    车间里孙翠英和孙玉珍连出两个坏轴。她俩都很苦恼，在会上也不发言，蕙莲一想：咱们工人都
  一样，完不成国家计划，谁心里都难受。光批评是不顶事，还要多多在技术上帮助才行。于是她就主动给她们说提高质量的重要性，又教她们提高质量的办法，她俩觉得有道理，就照着做，果然，一个季度没出坏轴，全组光荣地被评为优胜小组。
    “你是四个孩子的母亲，你一年没旷一天工，在业余学校也没旷课，这真不容易啊！中间你遇到过困难吗？”我又问。
      “有孩子是要麻烦些咯！但不能为孩子三天两头不参加生产。不然，算个啥新中国妇女呢？”她说，有一回，第四个孩子出水痘，发高烧，夜夜哭闹到天亮，在这节骨眼里，长坡胃病又犯了。她只好坐着抱孩子到天亮，接着就上班，身体累的不行。这时刻，她真想请个假，可又想：“厂里生产那么紧张，我歇一天，副手也就跟着歇一天，架子没人开，小组怎样完成国家计划呢？要是轴子供应不上，布场要停工待料，国家计划怎样能完成？况且自己又是共产党员、光坐着抱孩子，不努力去为孩子创造幸福，这算啥？”于是她就把孩子的病情告诉保姆，她们答应给她看病，她又安心上班去了。蕙莲停下话喝一口水，最后又说：“我能够按部就班的工作，那是托儿所的功劳！她们带孩子比我自己带的还好，我怎能不安心去生产、学习？可是作为一个共产党员，我真感到我过去做的事情还太少！”
