	Female Drillers on the Bridge
	—A Chronicle of the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team
	By our reporter, Lu Hao
	There were three of them. Xiao Cao was the oldest, twenty-one this year. Gao Guizhen was twenty years old. Xiao Tan was the youngest, only sixteen. All of them were female drillers in the Second Detachment of the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team. This night, Xiao Gao couldn't sleep and woke up Xiao Cao and Xiao Tan as well. Xiao Cao said sleepily, "You—you're not concentrating, that's why you can't sleep." Xiao Gao didn't agree at all when she heard this. She said, "You're the one who's not concentrating. You even doze off at work. If you're always thinking about work, you definitely won't be able to sleep."
	"I just started working the night shift, I'm not used to it, that's why I doze off. I can't help it," Xiao Cao explained, sounding somewhat aggrieved, her voice a bit hoarse as she spoke slowly.
	"Don't explain, dozing off at work definitely means you're not concentrating," Gao Guizhen said, "I had it happen once too. The rear pump wasn't pumping water, and others were repairing it. I was responsible for holding the lantern for them. Our machine leader suddenly asked me: 'Is the rear oil pipe normal?' I was stunned for a moment. The machine leader noticed I was dozing off, and he said: 'I forbid you to doze off.' Ever since that incident, I haven't dozed off again."
	Xiao Cao nodded.
	"Otherwise, the male comrades will say again: 'Look at you 'great' women, forget about it,'" Xiao Gao deliberately made her voice rough, imitating a man's voice. She said, "Others look down on us, so we have to study hard."
	"Of course, we have to study hard. I wish I could learn everything all at once," Xiao Tan simply put on her clothes and sat up. "But, what if you want to learn, but others don't let you? I've been on the boat for two months, but I haven't even touched the lever yet. When will I ever learn?" She said with a somewhat disappointed and pessimistic tone.
	"Right, it's good enough if they don't let you touch it. Some people are always joking around saying: 'You female comrades, you only know how to cook and wash clothes. This kind of work isn't for you.' And they even say, 'Little girl, stand aside!' These words are like the old society saying women are 'money-losing goods.' Xiao Gao, listen to how infuriating that is."
	Based on her own experience, Xiao Gao replied to Xiao Cao confidently, "What's the use of just getting angry? Of course, that kind of thinking is wrong. Some people say we can't do it, but does that mean we really can't? We should work hard. As long as you work hard, the comrades will teach us." She said full of confidence, "There are female comrades working in the sky, underground, and at sea. Can't we do it? We'll form a team in the future too, and it'll be great if it can be like Zhu Xiucheng's 'March 8th Drilling Team'."
	Before dawn, none of them went back to sleep. Before they knew it, it was time to go to work.
	The weather was gloomy, and it had been raining for many days. The muddy road leading to the river was even more difficult to walk than a rice paddy.
	When they arrived at the dock, the No. 1 tugboat sending them to work was tooting its horn, urging people to hurry and board.
	The white sails of the wooden boats coming out of the Han River and going upstream on the Yangtze River looked like a towering wall, shielding the tall buildings of Hankou. This fleet, consisting of sailboats with canopies and golden yellow hulls, rowboats with double oars that seemed to rock even in calm weather, fishing boats full of lively, jumping fresh fish, and small steamers sailing rhythmically with cheerful whistles, was moving on this wide river that seemed like a water highway. The No. 1 tugboat immediately joined this procession.
	Like all the drillers, they agilely stepped onto the pontoon, and the diesel engine driving the drilling rig shook the huge pontoon, even making the waterlogged areas under the sleepers pressed down by the casing on the deck bubble.
	Gao Guizhen was already used to all of this. When she first arrived on the boat, she was like many people who had never been on a boat, and she often felt nauseous. With even the slightest wind and waves, the pontoon would rock, and she would feel dizzy. Now, she didn't care about anything.
	She was now the assistant to Zhang Ronggui, the rear operator of Machine No. 2. After taking over, she watched the diesel engine running normally, so she went to the front of the machine to help. Machine No. 2 was hoisting the drilling tools, and like a skilled driller, she climbed up the four-meter-high drilling tower in a few steps. She remembered the first time she went up the drilling tower, she was really scared. She thought: If the male comrades can go up, why can't I? She mustered her courage and managed to get up, but she didn't dare to move. Someone called her from below, but she didn't dare to answer, afraid of falling. Now, she could stand alone on the top, supporting the drill pipe and tightening the screws on the fork ring, doing everything calmly and methodically.
	She came down from the drilling tower and went to the drilling rig. She took the feed handle from someone else's hand, sometimes holding it high with both hands, and sometimes letting her hands droop down as if the feed handle was naughty and wanted to run away.
	"How is it down below?" Machine Leader Li Yunzhang asked her.
	"It feels numb down below. It seems the drill bit has hit iron sand. It's pretty normal."
	The machine leader said with satisfaction, "You can already work like our male comrades. You can stand with us completely."
	Everyone on Machine No. 2 still remembered some of the things that happened more than three months ago when Gao Guizhen had just arrived on the machine. At that time, when people heard that a female comrade was coming to the drilling machine, many people said, "That's just adding an extra person. Men can learn it in two years, but women can't learn it even in two and a half years." Machine Leader Li Yunzhang's view was: "Having one is better than not having one."
	One night in the latter half of the night, not long after she had arrived on the drilling machine, she accidentally brushed her sleeve against the throttle while adding oil to the rear engine, and the rear engine immediately stalled.
	At this time, the drill bit was drilling into the overburden and encountered sand. As soon as the diesel engine stalled, the drill bit was buried in the sand. Fortunately, the comrades in the front of the machine pressed down the feed handle quickly, and an accident was almost avoided.
	"Why did the engine stall?" the machine leader asked.
	"Accidentally, my sleeve brushed against the throttle!"
	"If you had smashed the oil tank, the engine would have stalled even more thoroughly."
	Gao Guizhen knew that the machine leader was being sarcastic because he was angry. She felt very sad. She thought: Why are there so many difficulties? She couldn't help but sit down and cry. She cried for a little while, but no one could spare the time to comfort her. She heard the comrades in the front of the machine busily lowering the drill pipe, and she immediately realized that her crying was wrong. She wiped away her tears and walked out of the tent.
	Not far from Machine No. 2 was the location of Machine No. 4. Qi Wenming, the assistant machine leader of Machine No. 4, was Xiao Gao's lover. He heard the diesel engine stop and knew that something was wrong with the rear engine of Machine No. 2. Now that he saw Xiao Gao come out, he asked, "Why did the rear engine stall? Is it out of oil?"
	Xiao Gao ignored him. He asked sternly, "It must be a problem because you weren't concentrating and weren't responsible in your work."
	Xiao Gao couldn't accept it for a moment. She thought: I don't need you to scold me. She said, "Why are you so harsh with me?" She felt even more sad.
	When she returned, the diesel engine was already running again. The drill pipe was rotating, and everything had returned to its original state. Since arriving at the pontoon, she had been eager to know what was going on in the mysterious riverbed drill hole.
	Inside the pipe mouth, the river water churning up from the bottom of the river was boiling like boiling water. The drill pipe was spinning rapidly. She watched Xue Enqin holding the feed handle, standing solemnly and calmly. She was extremely envious. She thought, I hope that one day, I can work as skillfully as him. As always, she was attracted by this magical sight.
	"Why don't you try holding it," Machine Leader Li Yunzhang said to her, as if his anger from just now had long dissipated.
	"I can't," she said shyly.
	"Your hand is holding this feed handle, and this hand will be like an eye. You can see the situation at the bottom of the river, and you can know whether our drill bit is hitting soft rock or hard rock…"
	She began to learn how to operate the feed handle.
	After work, Li Yunzhang went to find her and said to her, "Xiao Gao, I didn't think carefully enough about what I said just now."
	At first, Xiao Gao didn't understand. She said, "What's wrong?"
	"I lost my temper with you just now, and I want to apologize to you."
	"You said that to me for my own good. How could I not even know that?"
	"You often say that we're like close brothers and sisters. Then why did you cry when I said one thing to you?"
	Mentioning the crying made Gao Guizhen herself feel embarrassed. She said, "I hope you can treat me the same as the male comrades in the future and not forgive me just because I'm a girl."
	In the rear of the machine where Gao Guizhen worked, there was an oil tank, and the running diesel engine shook the oil tank as if it were tap dancing. The diesel fuel splashing out of the oil tank often splashed a thick layer on the floor, the oil tank, and her whole body. This oil splashed every day, as if no one could see it. She thought: So much oil is being splashed away, what a pity. Could a lid be made to seal it tightly and prevent it from splashing?
	She said to technical instructor Gao Shulin, "Master Gao, could the oil tank opening be welded shut?"
	"How would we pour in the oil if it's welded shut?"
	"Would it work to leave a small opening?"
	"Maybe it would work. Let's try it." Master Gao helped her draw a sketch. After work, she and Zhang Ronggui carried the oil tank to the repair shop to be welded.
	A lid was welded onto the oil tank. The oil no longer splashed out. In the past, oil had to be added four or five times per shift, adding ten or twenty catties each time. Now, oil is added three or four times per shift, not only is the rear of the machine clean, but diesel fuel is also saved.
	Xiao Gao not only learned quickly, but she also made a small invention, which changed many people's minds. When Xiao Gao had just arrived at the rear of the machine a few days prior, Zhang Ronggui said to the machine leader, "I don't think it will work. If it were a male comrade, he would have learned it long ago." However, after Xiao Gao became slightly familiar with the situation on the drilling machine, the situation changed. She remembered everything after being told once. Not long after arriving at the rear of the machine, she knew exactly where the oil in the oil tank went, what locations it passed through to get to the combustion chamber, and what changes occurred. Now, Xiao Gao's lover, Qi Wenming, sometimes asked Zhang Ronggui about her progress in learning. Zhang Ronggui said, "The past view of female comrades was wrong. I really didn't expect her to learn so quickly."
	When I recently visited Gao Guizhen, those who previously thought that female comrades could not do machine work, now everyone admitted that their past views were wrong.

    大桥上的女钻探工
    ——长江大桥地质钻探队纪事
    本报记者　陆灏
    她们三个人，小曹最大，今年二十一岁。高桂珍二十岁。小谭最小，她才十六岁。都是长江大桥地质钻探队二分队的女钻探工。这天夜晚，小高睡不着，把小曹小谭也弄醒了。小曹粘粘糊糊地说：“你呀——思想不集中，当然就睡不着了。”小高一听这话，哪里能同意。她说：“你的思想才不集中呢。你上班还打瞌睡。要是心里老想工作，你准睡不着。”
      “我刚上夜班，不习惯，才打瞌睡。我自己也没有法子。”小曹好像受了委屈似地在解释，声音有些喑哑，她缓慢地说。
    “别解释了，上班打盹，准是思想不集中。”高桂珍说：“我也有过一次，那是后车水泵不来水，别人在修理，我负责给他们提灯。我们机长忽然问我：‘后车油管正常不正常？’我愣了一下，机长发觉我在打盹，他就说：‘我禁止你打盹。’自从发生那次事情以后，我就再也没有打过盹。”
    小曹点点头。
    “要不人家男同志又要说了：‘看你们‘伟大’的妇女，算了吧’。”小高把声音故意憋得挺粗，摹仿着男人说话的嗓子。她说：“别人瞧不起我们，我们越要好好学。”
      “当然要好好学，我还恨不得一时把什么都学会呢。”小谭干脆披着衣服坐起来了：“可是，你想学，别人不让你学怎么办，我已经在船上呆了两个月了，可是，闸把还没有扶过呢。这到什么时候才能学会啊？”她有点失望地带着悲观的口气说。
    “对呀，不让你摸还算好呢。有人还老闹着玩儿说：‘你们女同志，只会做饭、洗衣服，这些活儿不是你们干的。’还说什么‘小毛丫头，站到一边去吧！’这话跟过去旧社会说女人是‘赔钱货’一样，小高，你听听这话多气人哪。”
    小高根据自己的经验，她有信心地回答小曹说：“光生干气有什么用？这样的看法当然不对，有人说我们不行，难道我们就真的不行了吗？咱们应该努力学，你只要努力，同志们会教给咱们的。”她充满着信心说：“天空，地下，海上，什么地方都有女同志在工作，难道咱们就不能干？咱们将来也成立一个班，能像朱秀成那个‘三八钻探组’就好了。”
    在天亮以前，她们谁也没有再睡去，不知不觉，很快就到了上班的时间了。
    天气阴霾，雨已经连续下了很多天了，通向江边的泥路，比秧田还烂得难走。
    她们到了码头上，送她们上班的一号轮正嘟嘟嘟地在拉着汽笛催促人们赶快上船。
    从汉水出来往长江上游去的木船上的白帆，看起来像一座高耸的墙，它把汉口高大的建筑物都遮蔽住了。这有篷的闪着金黄色船身的帆船，划着双桨在这风平浪静的时候也显得颠簸的划子，船头几乎好像是钻在水里头的满载着活蹦乱跳的鲜鱼的渔船，鸣叫着快活的汽笛有节奏航行的小火轮所组成的浩浩荡荡的船队，在这好像是一条水上公路似的宽阔的江面上行进。一号轮马上也加入了这个行列。
    她们和所有的钻工一样敏捷地跨上了趸船，这庞大的趸船被带动钻机的柴油机震动着，连甲板上套管压着的枕木下面的渍水，也被一颠一颠地打着小泡泡。
    对这一切，高桂珍已经习以为常了。初到船上来，她也很像许多没有到过船上的人，常常想呕吐，稍许起点风浪，趸船摇晃起来，她就觉得天眩地转，现在，她什么也不在乎了。
    她现在是二号机后车张荣贵的助手。她接了班，看着柴油机在正常的运转，于是，她就到前车来帮忙。二号机正在提升钻具，她像一个熟练的钻工，三步两步就爬到四公尺多高的钻塔上去。她记得第一次上钻塔的时候，心里真哆嗦，她想：男同志能上，我为什么不能上，她鼓足了勇气算是上去了，但却不敢走动。有人在下边叫她，她不敢答应，怕跌下来。现在，她一个人在上面扶钻杆，拧叉环上的螺丝，什么事情都做得不慌不忙，有条有理。
    她从钻塔上下来到了钻机跟前。她从别人手里接过了给进把，她一会儿双手高高地举着它；那给进把好像是淘气要跑掉似的一会儿两只手又垂下来操纵着它。
    “底下怎么样？”机长李云章问她。
    “底下麻酥酥的，想来钻头已经碰上铁砂了，挺正常。”
    机长满意地说：“你已经可以像我们男同志一样工作了。你完全可以和我们站在一起了。”
    二号钻机上的人谁也还记得高桂珍在三个多月以前刚到钻机上来的时候发生过的一些事情。那时候，人们听说钻机上要来一个女同志，很多人说
  “那是白添一个人，男人学两年就能学会，女人学两年半也学不成。”机长李云章的看法是：“有一个总比没有一个强。”
    有一天后半夜，那是她到钻机上来还没有多长时间，因为要给后车添油，一不小心，衣袖一带，把油门关了，后车马上灭了。
    这时候，钻头正在覆盖层钻进，碰上了砂子，柴油机一灭，钻头就埋在砂里头了。幸亏前车的同志们用给进把压得快，差一点出了事故。
    “车怎么灭了？”机长问。
    “不小心，袖子一带把油门关了！”
    “你要是把油罐砸了，车就灭得更彻底了。”
    高桂珍听了，她知道这是机长生气在讽刺她呢。她心里很难过，她想：困难怎么这样多啊，她忍不住，一个人就坐着哭起来了。她哭了一小会，这时候谁也顾不上来劝她，她听着前车的同志们正在紧张地下钻杆，马上觉得自己哭得不对。她又擦擦眼泪，走出帐篷来。
    离二号钻机不远是四号钻机的位置。四号钻机的副机长齐文明是小高的爱人，他听见柴油机不响了，知道二号机的后车出了毛病，现在又看见小高走出来，他问：“怎么后车灭了，是缺油吗？”
    小高没有理他。他狠声狠气地问：“准是精神不集中，工作不负责任出了毛病。”
    小高一时接受不了，她想：用不着你来克我。她说：“你为什么对我这样厉害？”她心里更觉得难过起来。
    她回来，柴油机已经轧轧地开动了。钻杆已经在旋转，一切又恢复了原来的情形。她检查了一下后车，就走到前车去。她自从来到了趸船，就渴望着知道这谜一样的江底的钻眼里，究竟是怎么一回事。
    那管口里，从江底翻上来的江水像沸水一样地翻滚着。钻杆飞旋着。她看着薛恩勤扶着给进把，严肃的神色安若地站立着，她羡慕得不得了，她想，有朝一天，我也能像他那样熟练地工作就好了。她像往日一样，又为这奇妙的景象吸引了。
    “你来扶扶试试看”机长李云章对她说。好像刚才的怒气早已烟消云散了。
    “我不会”。她羞怯地说。
    “你的手扶着这给进把，这手就会像眼睛一样，你就可以好像看到这江底的情形，你就能够知道我们的钻头现在是碰上了软石头还是硬石头……。”
    她开始了操纵给进把的学习。
    下班以后。李云章去找她，对她说：“小高，我刚才说话太不考虑了。”
    开始，小高还不明白，她说：“怎么啦？”
    “我刚才对你发了脾气，我要向你检讨。”
    “你这样说我，是为了我好，我怎么能连这一点也不知道。”
    “你常说我们像亲兄弟亲姊妹一样，那为什么我说了你一句，你就哭了呢？”
    一提起哭这件事，高桂珍自己也觉得难为情，他说：“希望以后你能像对男同志一样地要求我，不要因为我是个女孩子就原谅我。”
    在高桂珍工作的后车有个油箱，开动着的柴油机把油箱震得像跳踢跶舞似的。油箱里溅出来的柴油常常把地板、油箱和她的全身，泼上厚厚的一层。这油，天天溅，好像谁也看不见似的。她想：这样多的油，很多都给溅掉了，多可惜啊。能不能弄个盖子把它封严了不让它溅呢。
    她给技术指导高树林说：“高师傅，能不能把油箱口焊住。”
    “焊上了怎么灌油？”
    “留个小口子行吗？”
    “也许行，咱们试试看。”高师傅帮她画了张草图。下了班，她和张荣贵两个人背着油箱交给修配间去电焊。
    油箱上焊了一个盖子。油就再也溅不出来了。过去一个班要添四、五次油，一次添一二十斤，现在一个班添三四次，不但后车干净，柴油也节省了。
    小高不但学得快，而且还有了个小小的创造，这把很多人的脑筋都改变过来了。当小高刚来后车不几天，张荣贵还对机长说：“我看不行呀，要是男同志，早就学会了。”可是，在小高稍许熟悉了钻机上的情形以后，情况就不同了。很多事给她说一次，她就全部记住了。她到了后车时间不久，她对于后车油箱里的油，经过什么地点到燃烧室，再经过什么地方发生什么变化，她就一目了然了。现在，小高的爱人齐文明，有时向张荣贵打听打听她的学习的情形，张荣贵说：“过去对女同志的看法不对，我真没有想到她能学得这样快。”
    最近我访问高桂珍的时候，那些过去认为女同志还能做机器活的人，现在谁也承认自己过去的看法不对了。
