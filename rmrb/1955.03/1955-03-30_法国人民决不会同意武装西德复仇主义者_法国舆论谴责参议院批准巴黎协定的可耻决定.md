Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: TASS, Paris, March 28th—The French Republic Senate's decision to approve the Paris Accords has aroused deep indignation among French patriots, who unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely strive for the struggle against German militarization and for French security. Democratic newspapers on the 28th pointed out that the French people do not agree and will never agree to arming West German revanchists.

    "L'Humanité" published an article by André Stil, which pointed out that the Republic Senate's decision is "an act against peace and France." The author wrote that the French people's struggle is not over. The author said, "This vote does not change the attitude of French public opinion, nor can it drive our people into the atomic slaughterhouse like a herd of cattle."
    Marcel Fourrier pointed out in "Libération": It was the parliament, not the entire country, that approved the Paris Accords. He pointed out that millions of German working people are fighting in their own country against the revival of German militarism. Similarly, French patriots will use all their strength to fight against this danger.
    The approval of the Paris Accords did not even arouse particularly enthusiastic emotions among commentators in right-wing newspapers, some of whom could not conceal their unease about the reconstruction of the German "Bundeswehr." They also admitted that the approval of the Paris Accords would not end the divisions and chaos within the French bourgeois parties. Pierre Brisson, editor-in-chief of "Le Figaro," lamented that the "wavering of French policy" was demonstrated on the issue of the Paris Accords, and that French politicians were acting in a situation of "mutual recrimination."
    The "Midi-Télégramme" of Toulouse pointed out that the approval of the Paris Accords cannot eliminate the contradictions between Western countries, whether "on the issue of East-West negotiations, the issue of arms integration, the Saar issue," or other international issues.

    法国人民决不会同意武装西德复仇主义者
    法国舆论谴责参议院批准巴黎协定的可耻决定
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法国共和国参议院关于批准巴黎协定的决议引起了法国爱国者深切的愤慨，他们一致表示要坚决努力进行反对德国军国主义化、争取法国安全的斗争。二十八日民主报纸指出，法国人民不同意，而且永远不会同意武装西德复仇主义者。
    “人道报”发表安德烈·斯梯的文章，其中指出，共和国参议院的决定是“反对和平和法国的行动”。作者写道，但是，法国人民的斗争并未就此结束。作者说，“这次表决结果并不能改变法国社会舆论的态度，也不能把我国人民像一群牲口一样赶进原子屠宰场。”
    马赛尔·弗里埃在“解放报”上指出：是议会，并不是全国批准了巴黎协定。他指出，数百万德国劳动人民正在自己的国家内为反对复活德国军国主义而斗争，同样，法国爱国者也将用全部力量来对这一危险作斗争。
    批准巴黎协定甚至在右派报纸的评论员中也没有引起特别热烈的情绪，其中有些人还掩盖不住他们对重建德国“国防军”的不安心情。他们还承认，批准巴黎协定绝不会使法国资产阶级政党内部的分裂和混乱告一结束。“费加罗报”总编辑皮埃尔·布里松悲叹说，在巴黎协定问题上表现出“法国政策的动摇不定”，法国的政治家是在“互相责难”的情况下进行活动的。
    土鲁斯的“米迪电讯报”指出，批准巴黎协定不能消除西方国家之间无论是在“东西方谈判问题，军备统筹机构问题、萨尔问题”还是在其他国际问题上所产生的矛盾。
