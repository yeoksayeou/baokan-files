Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 6th. U.S. diplomatic envoys to the Far East and Southwest Pacific regions held a four-day secret meeting in the Philippines from the 2nd to the 5th.

The communique issued after the meeting acknowledged that the meeting placed its primary attention on the aggressive U.S. military deployments in the region. The communique revealed that the meeting discussed issues such as the U.S. policy of obstructing China's liberation of Taiwan and the measures formulated at the Bangkok Conference to suppress national liberation movements in Asian countries. The meeting also discussed the issue of the U.S. strengthening its economic aggression in Southeast Asia. The meeting's communique kept the results of discussions on all these issues strictly secret.

According to Western news agencies, many diplomats pointed out at the meeting that due to the increasing unpopularity of the U.S. aggressive policy in Asia, the method of controlling Asian countries through so-called "aid programs" is becoming increasingly difficult to implement. United Press reported: "Some ambassadors reported that it is very difficult to voluntarily provide assistance without appearing to interfere in the sovereignty of the countries in which they are stationed."

    美国驻远东地区外交使节举行会议
    策划美国在远东的侵略部署
    【新华社六日讯】马尼拉消息：美国驻远东和西南太平洋地区的外交使节，从二日到五日在菲律宾举行了四天的秘密会议。
    会议结束后发表的公报承认，会议把它的首要注意力放在美国在这一地区的侵略性军事部署方面。公报透露，会议讨论了美国阻挠中国解放台湾的政策和曼谷会议所制订的镇压亚洲国家民族解放运动的措施等问题。会议还讨论了美国加强对东南亚的经济侵略问题。会议的公报对所有这些问题的讨论结果严守秘密。
    据西方通讯社透露，不少外交官们在会上指出，由于美国侵略政策在亚洲日益不得人心，通过所谓“援助计划”来控制亚洲国家的办法，推行起来是越来越困难了。合众社的消息说：“某些大使们提出报告说，自愿提供援助而又要不显得是干涉他们驻在国的主权，这是有很大困难的。”
