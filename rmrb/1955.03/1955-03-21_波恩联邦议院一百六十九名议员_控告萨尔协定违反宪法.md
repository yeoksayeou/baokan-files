Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: Bonn dispatch: The Social Democratic Party parliamentary group of the West German Bundestag announced on the 18th that one hundred and sixty-nine members of the Bonn Federal Parliament have jointly submitted a petition to the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, accusing the Saar Agreement of violating the constitution.

The petition states: The Saar Agreement signed in Paris on October 23, 1954, by German Chancellor Adenauer and French Prime Minister Mendès-France is incompatible with the West German Basic Law.

Before the Federal Constitutional Court makes a ruling on this accusation, the Saar Agreement and the entire Paris Agreements will not take effect.

Following the filing of this accusation, West German President Heuss announced that he would temporarily not sign the Paris Agreements, which had already been approved by both houses of the Bonn Parliament. The official explanation is that Heuss will "study the constitutional situation."

    波恩联邦议院一百六十九名议员
    控告萨尔协定违反宪法
   【新华社十九日讯】波恩消息：西德社会民主党议会党团十八日宣布，波恩联邦议院一百六十九名议员已联名向加尔斯卢合的联邦宪法法院提出一份请愿书，控告萨尔协定违反宪法。
    请愿书说：德国总理阿登纳和法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯于一九五四年十月二十三日在巴黎签订的萨尔协定同西德根本法是不相容的。
    在联邦宪法法院对这个控告作出判决以前，萨尔协定和整个巴黎协定都将不能生效。
    在这个控告提出以后，西德总统休斯宣布他将暂不签署已经由波恩议会上下两院批准的巴黎协定。官方解释说，休斯将“研究一下宪法方面的情况”。
