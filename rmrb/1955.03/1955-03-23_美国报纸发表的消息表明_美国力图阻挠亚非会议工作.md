Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 21st. TASS dispatch: Reports continuously published in American newspapers demonstrate that the United States is trying to obstruct the normal work of the Asian-African Conference.

The “New York Times” reporter, Hamilton, when discussing the reasons for the United States' anxiety about this conference, specifically pointed out that the People's Republic of China might show at the conference that it can guarantee to provide the necessary technical assistance to help Asian and African countries develop their economies.

Hamilton went on to believe that Asian and African countries attach great importance to the Soviet Union's proposal to provide technical assistance to economically backward countries, and they are convinced that "their economic backwardness is the result of exploitation by Western capitalism, especially the United States." Hamilton emphasized that the Soviet Union's decision to participate in the United Nations technical assistance program "was greeted with extreme excitement by Asian countries." The agreement between the Soviet Union and India on building a steel plant in Orissa Province was warmly welcomed. He then wrote, "Given the enthusiasm shown by backward countries for using atomic energy for power generation, the Soviet Union's recent proposal to give a report introducing atomic reactors is even more important."

It can be seen from Hamilton's report that the United States holds the opposite attitude and is therefore condemned by Asian countries.

It can be seen from the "New York Herald Tribune" reporter's report that the hope of the United States is that countries bound by U.S. military treaties will "defend the United States and its policies toward the Far East and Asia" at the Asian-African Conference. The countries referred to by American newspapers are Turkey, Thailand, and Pakistan.

    美国报纸发表的消息表明
    美国力图阻挠亚非会议工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国报纸不断发表的消息，证明了美国力图阻挠亚非会议的正常工作。
    “纽约时报”记者汉密尔顿在谈到美国对这次会议担忧的原因时，特别指出，中华人民共和国可能在会议上表明，它能保证给予必要的技术帮助，以便帮助亚非国家发展它们的经济。
    汉密尔顿接着认为，亚非国家极为重视苏联关于给予经济落后国家以技术帮助的建议，它们确信，
  “它们经济落后的情况是西方资本主义特别是美国剥削的结果”。汉密尔顿强调指出，苏联参加联合国技术援助计划的决定“受到了亚洲国家极其兴奋的欢迎”。苏联、印度关于在奥里萨省建设炼钢厂的协定受到了热烈的欢迎。他接着写道，“鉴于落后国家对利用原子能发电所表现的热情，不久前苏联提出的关于做介绍原子反应堆的报告的建议就更加重要。”
    从汉密尔顿的报道中可以看出，美国抱着相反的态度，因而遭到亚洲国家的谴责。
    从“纽约先驱论坛报”记者的报道中可以看出，美国所抱的希望是：为美国军事条约所束缚的国家将在亚非会议上“维护美国，维护它对远东和亚洲的政策。”美国报纸所指的这些国家是土耳其、泰国和巴基斯坦。
