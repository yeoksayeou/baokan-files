Xinjiang Province's Department of Transportation Transportation Bureau trained more than 1,200 workers from twelve nationalities in 1954 alone. Among them, forty-seven have been selected as model workers and attended the Transportation Bureau's recent transportation professional and model worker conference. Some of them are young soldiers transferred from the army, some are children of herdsmen from the grasslands, and some are children of peasants who have been emancipated in the countryside. In order to train these ethnic minority workers well, the Transportation Bureau established a driver training team. Among the more than 300 students who graduated from the first phase of the training team, there were more than 240 ethnic minority students.

Ethnic minority workers are very serious when learning technology. Hadier Yiming, a first-class labor model of the Transportation Bureau, only came to the Transportation Bureau's driver training team to learn technology in 1953. After graduation, because of hard study and practice, the average mileage of five tires on his car exceeded 20,000 kilometers. In 1954, he completed 112.57 percent of the transportation tasks assigned to him by the organization. Han workers also patiently helped ethnic minority workers learn technology. Yang Shanli, a first-class labor model of the Transportation Bureau, treated his assistant Sudaner like a brother. He often said: "Xinjiang is so big, and there are so many fraternal nationalities. It is impossible to build Xinjiang well without many ethnic minority workers." Sudaner learned to drive a car for less than five months and learned how to get on steel plates, change tires, and perform general maintenance.

    新疆积极培养兄弟民族工人
    新疆省交通厅运输局在一九五四年一年内在十二个民族中培养了一千二百多名工人，其中已有四十七名被选为劳动模范，出席了运输局最近召开的运输专业及劳动模范会议。他们有的是从部队转业的青年战士，有的是来自草原的牧民子弟，有的是农村翻身农民的子弟。为了培养训练好这些民族工人，运输局成立了驾驶人员训练大队。在训练大队第一期毕业的三百多个学员中，就有二百四十多个民族学员。
    民族工人们在学习技术的时候，都非常认真。运输局甲等劳动模范哈的尔依明，一九五三年才到运输局驾驶人员训练大队学习技术，毕业后，因为苦学、苦练，他的车上有五个轮胎平均超驶了两万公里以上。一九五四年，他完成了组织上交给他的运输任务百分之一百一十二点五七。汉族工人们也耐心地帮助民族工人们学习技术。运输局甲等劳动模范杨善礼对他的助手苏丹尔像亲兄弟一样。他常说：“新疆地方这么大，兄弟民族又多，要把新疆建设好，没有很多的民族工人是办不到的。”苏丹尔学习驾驶车子不到五个月，就学会了上钢板，换轮胎，和一般保养等技术。
