Heilongjiang Province's local state-owned industries are preparing to trial-produce over two hundred new products this year and will also carry out diversification modifications to some existing products.

The "MCA-1100" type combined thresher, which will be trial-produced by the Jiamusi Machinery Factory this year, has greater advantages than the "MK-1100" type thresher successfully trial-produced in the province last year: both wheat feeding and straw screening are mechanized, and the machine structure is more robust and durable. With slight modifications, it can also thresh crops such as soybeans and sorghum. The Songjiang Machinery Factory will trial-produce medium-sized double-wheel double-share plows and Czech-style rocker arm harvesters. Czech-style rocker arm harvesters can harvest wheat, barley, oats, soybeans, and millet. The Qiqihar Machinery Factory will trial-produce imitations of Soviet-style hay rakes, imitations of Polish double-share plows, horse-drawn beet diggers, and the like. Building materials such as sawdust tiles, magnesite tiles, artificial hemp fiber, lightweight insulation bricks, asbestos tiles, and asbestos ropes will be trial-produced or continue to be trial-produced this year at the Jiamusi Plywood Factory, Hulan Gongnong Match Factory, Qiqihar Ceramics Factory, etc. Sawdust tiles are made from sawdust and a small amount of magnesia. They are not only low in cost but also have the characteristics of heat preservation and durability. Artificial hemp fiber is made from the fiber of tree bark. The pig iron straightening machine being trial-produced by the Harbin Machinery Factory, which can straighten 120 to 140 tons of pig iron per day, the yellow prussiate of soda being trial-produced by the Harbin Pigment Factory, an important industrial raw material, and the cotton sliver cans for the textile industry being trial-produced by the Songjiang Hardware Factory are all important products supporting the production of state-owned industries. To meet the needs of the development of traditional Chinese medicine, the Songjiang Pharmaceutical Factory will also trial-produce many traditional Chinese medicine products this year.

Products to be modified this year include automatic threshers for dehusking rice, various knitwear, leather shoes, and rubber shoes.

    黑龙江地方工业将试制二百多种新产品
    黑龙江省地方国营工业今年准备试制二百多种新产品，并对部分原有产品进行多样化改制工作。
    佳木斯机械厂今年试制的“MCA—一一○○”型复式脱谷机较省内去年试制成功的“MK—一一○○”型脱谷机具有更大的优越性：麦子喂入和麦秆筛出都机械化了，机器构造也较为坚固耐用，如稍加改装，还可脱大豆、高粱等作物。松江机械厂将试制中型双轮双铧犁和捷克式摇臂收割机。捷克式摇臂收割机可割小麦、大麦、燕麦、大豆和谷子。齐齐哈尔机械厂将试制仿苏马拉搂草机、仿波兰双铧犁、马拉甜菜挖掘机等。建筑材料锯末瓦、菱苦土瓦、人造麻刀、轻质保温砖、石绵瓦、石绵绳等，今年将在佳木斯胶合板厂、呼兰工农火柴厂、齐齐哈尔陶瓷厂等进行试制或继续试制。锯末瓦是利用锯末和少许镁砂制成的，不单成本低，并兼有保温、耐用等特点。人造麻刀是利用树皮的纤维制造的。哈尔滨机械厂试制的每天可曲断生铁一百二十吨到一百四十吨的生铁曲断机，哈尔滨颜料厂试制的重要工业原料黄血盐，松江五金厂试制的为纺织工业用的棉条桶，都是支援国营工业生产的重要产品。为了适应中医发展的需要，松江制药厂今年也将试制许多中药制品。
    今年进行改制的产品有供脱水稻用的自动脱谷机、各种针织品、皮鞋、胶鞋等。
