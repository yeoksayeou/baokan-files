Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 23rd: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong, at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 22nd, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, lodged a strong protest with the US side regarding the US side's continued violation of the Armistice Agreement by dispatching armed military personnel into the area under the control of the Korean-Chinese side to conduct hostile activities. At the same time, he demanded that the US side, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, severely punish the instigators who organized the relevant incidents, as well as all US personnel involved, and demanded that the US side take practical measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.

The facts of the US violation of the Armistice Agreement are as follows: On February 8th, at approximately 23:00 Korean time, Kim Kwang-hoon and Kim Young-yeol, military personnel from the 60th Company of the 379th Battalion of the 3519th HID Unit under the US side, illegally crossed the Military Demarcation Line with weapons and entered the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean-Chinese side to conduct hostile activities. As a result, they were captured by the Korean-Chinese side.

The Fifth Joint Observer Team conducted a joint investigation into the above-mentioned incident on February 9th, interrogated the US military personnel Kim Kwang-hoon and Kim Young-yeol, carefully examined the various pieces of material evidence they carried, and interrogated the civil police of the Korean-Chinese side who were on duty at the scene of the incident. As a result, the following facts were determined: The US side dispatched armed military personnel, in open violation of the Armistice Agreement, to enter the area under the control of the Korean-Chinese side to conduct hostile activities. Kim Kwang-hoon and Kim Young-yeol also confessed to their crimes of illegally entering the area under the control of the Korean-Chinese side to conduct hostile activities.

In addition, on March 6th, at approximately 21:10 Korean time, four US military personnel with weapons illegally crossed the Military Demarcation Line and entered the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean-Chinese side, and attacked the civil police of the Korean-Chinese side who were performing patrol duties at the time. The civil police of the Korean-Chinese side returned fire in self-defense, killing one of the invading US military personnel on the spot, and the other three fled to the US side.

The Sixth Joint Observer Team conducted a joint investigation into the above-mentioned incident on March 9th, interrogated the two civil police officers of the Korean-Chinese side who were performing patrol duties at the time of the incident, and carefully examined the body of the slain US military personnel and various material evidence left at the scene. As a result, this fact was determined: The US side dispatched armed military personnel into the area under the control of the Korean-Chinese side, in open violation of the Armistice Agreement, to attack the civil police of the Korean-Chinese side.

At the meeting, the chief representative of the US side, Katter, clumsily attempted to distort the facts, and openly distorted the facts in the face of ample and powerful testimonial and material evidence. He even insisted that the confessions of the above-mentioned military personnel dispatched by the US side could not constitute evidence proving that they were US military personnel.

At the meeting, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho refuted the US side's unreasonable arguments by citing the facts determined through the investigations of the Joint Observer Team, and pointed out that the US side's attempt to evade responsibility with the same old sophistry would only expose the US side's crimes to the public. He concluded by saying that the US side must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from any act by the US side that violates the Armistice Agreement.

    朝中方面抗议美方违反停战协定的行为
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在军事停战委员会二十二日的会议上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将就美方继续违反停战协定派遣武装军事人员进入朝中方面地区进行敌对活动一事，向美方提出了强硬的抗议。同时，他要求美方依照停战协定的规定，严厉惩处组织有关事件的唆使分子以及所涉及的美方所有人员，并且要求美方采取实际措施，防止将来再发生同样事件。
    美方违反停战协定的事实是：二月八日朝鲜时间二十三时左右，美方所属第三五一九HID联队第三七九大队第六○中队军事人员金光勋和金英烈携带武器非法越过军事分界线，进入朝中方面管辖下的非军事区进行敌对活动。结果他们被朝中方面俘获。
    第五联合观察小组在二月九日对上述事件进行了联合调查，讯问了美方军事人员金光勋和金英烈，仔细查看了他们携带的种种物证，并且讯问了事件发生时在场值勤的朝中方面民政警察。结果，确定了下面的事实：美方派遣武装军事人员公然违反停战协定进入朝中方面地区进行敌对活动。金光勋和金英烈也供认了他们非法进入朝中方面地区进行敌对活动的罪行。
    另外，三月六日朝鲜时间二十一时十分左右，美方四个带有武器的军事人员非法越过军事分界线进入朝中方面管辖下的非军事区，袭击当时正在执行巡逻勤务的朝中方面民政警察。朝中方面民政警察为了自卫予以回击，当场击毙侵入的美方军事人员一名，其他三人向美方地区逃逸。
    第六联合观察小组在三月九日对上述事件进行了联合调查，讯问了事件发生时执行巡逻勤务的朝中方面两名民政警察，并且仔细地查看了遗留在现场的被击毙的美方军事人员的尸体以及各种物证。结果，确定了这个事实：美方派遣武装军事人员进入朝中方面地区公然地违反停战协定袭击朝中方面民政警察。
    美方首席委员卡特尔在会议上笨拙地试图颠倒黑白，在充分有力的人证和物证面前公然歪曲事实。他甚至硬说上述美方派遣的军事人员的口供不能构成证明他们是美方军事人员的证据。
    李相朝中将在会议上援引通过联合观察小组的调查所确定的事实，驳斥了美方的无理说法，并且指出，美方试图用老一套的诡辩来逃避责任，只有使美方的罪行在公众面前暴露无遗。他最后说，由美方违反停战协定的任何行为所引起的一切后果，美方必须负全部责任。
