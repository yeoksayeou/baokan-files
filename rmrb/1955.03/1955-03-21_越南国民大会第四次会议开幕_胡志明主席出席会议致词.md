    Present at the meeting were Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly Ton Duc Thang, members of the Standing Committee, and approximately two hundred representatives from all over the country. Also attending the opening meeting were personnel from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, representatives from various political parties, mass organizations, the army, and people from all walks of life.

    As Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Ton Duc Thang, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, and others stepped onto the rostrum, the entire audience burst into enthusiastic applause.

    Ton Duc Thang delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that this session was the first to be held in the liberated capital. The representatives attending the meeting included people of all ethnicities, religions, and social strata from South, North, and Central Vietnam. This was a meeting to struggle for the implementation of the Geneva Accords, the advancement of land reform, the restoration and development of the economy, the improvement of the people's living standards, and the strengthening of the people's regime in order to achieve unification, independence, and democracy. Ton Duc Thang wished the conference success.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh stepped onto the podium to speak. All the representatives stood up and greeted him with thunderous and prolonged applause.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said in his speech: On behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I extend my congratulations to the representatives of the National Assembly of the heroic Vietnamese people. Four months after the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, our people, in a vibrant atmosphere of unity and firm opposition to foreign aggressors, elected our National Assembly in the free general election of January 6, 1946.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the government warmly welcomed the beloved representatives of South Vietnam. South Vietnam is our flesh and blood. Heroic South Vietnam was the first to raise the banner of resistance and fought bravely until the ceasefire order was issued to implement the Geneva Accords. South Vietnam is wholeheartedly and faithfully devoted to the motherland and the entire nation. The entire will and determination of South Vietnam aspire to the North, to the capital, to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh then said: The National Assembly is a symbol of the unwavering, steel-like, unified will of our nation. This meeting further strengthens this will: the determination to fight and the determination to win victory.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh also said that since the first session of the National Assembly was convened here nine years ago, the National Assembly, together with the government and the people, has been united in fighting for the cause of national liberation. The National Assembly has made a great contribution to the victory of the patriotic war. This victory has brought peace to our beloved motherland. Today, the National Assembly is meeting again in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to continue the struggle for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland. The achievements made in the past few years have laid the foundation for new tasks and work, which should be able to consolidate and develop the achievements made in the past. It is firmly believed that all the representatives will fulfill the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the people and the motherland.

    Next, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly Ton Quang Phiet reported on the implementation of land reform since the Third Session of the National Assembly in December 1953.

    Vice Premier Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered a report to the conference on the government's work during the past period, as well as the current situation and tasks.

    At the conference, congratulatory telegrams and letters to the National Assembly from the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnam National United Front, various democratic parties, and people's organizations were also read. Representatives from all walks of life in the capital also presented flowers to the conference and delivered speeches wishing the conference success.
