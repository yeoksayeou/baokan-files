    How the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company Organizes the Supply of Non-Staple Foods
    Yan Zhao

    To adapt to the new situation of increasing demand for non-staple foods from urban and rural residents, the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company has strengthened its non-staple food business, thus basically ensuring the needs of various industrial and mining areas, cities, and dyke and road construction sites in the province during the Spring Festival this year. However, in organizing the supply of non-staple foods, the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company took a detour.

    During last year's tense non-staple food supply situation in June and July, the trade company sent a large number of purchasing personnel to Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, and other places to find sources of goods in order to complete the supply task. As a result of purchasing personnel "flying all over the sky," although some non-staple foods were found to meet the temporary needs of some of the masses, they could not meet the regular needs of the masses. After the demand for non-staple foods increased in various provinces and cities in the fourth quarter of last year, some of the "flying" purchasing agents often returned empty-handed; although some found sources of goods, due to long-distance transportation, the time was too long to meet market needs, and the freight was too high, which increased costs. In fact, many non-staple foods could be locally sourced and processed. For example, Jiangxi Province is rich in radishes, vegetables, taro, potatoes, etc. The trade company did not organize processing itself, but sent people to Zhejiang to buy dried radishes and to Guangxi to buy potato flour. The Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold 100,000 catties of dried peppers to the Wuhan Native Produce Company, while the trade company sent people to Hunan, Guizhou, and other places to buy dried peppers. As for vermicelli, bean curd sheets, dried bean curd sticks, ham, bacon, sausages, etc., Jiangxi Province has the raw materials and processing conditions, but the trade company does not organize processing. Due to neglecting local sources of goods, local agricultural and sideline products were not purchased or organized for processing, which affected the income of farmers and handicraft workers and reduced their enthusiasm for production.

    It was not until the end of the fourth quarter of last year, due to the repeated failures of purchasing non-staple foods from other provinces and the criticism from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Commerce, that the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company corrected the mistake of "flying all over the sky" to find sources of goods, and began to pay attention to exploring local sources of non-staple foods, and organizing local processing for supply. Facts have proved that the potential for local sourcing and local processing of non-staple foods is very large. The total output value of non-staple food processing by the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company in the fourth quarter of last year was ten times that of the first quarter and two and a half times that of the third quarter. In January and February of this year, they continued to expand the non-staple food processing business. Originally, they only focused on the processing of grain, miscellaneous grains, reproductions, sugar products, and meat foods, but now they have begun to focus on the processing of dried vegetables, pickles, and other non-staple foods, and based on the characteristics that most non-staple foods are produced seasonally and supplied year-round, they have begun to store appropriate non-staple foods to supply the market needs during the peak season.

    The Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company has gained the following main experiences in the work of local sourcing and local processing for the supply of non-staple foods:

    1.  Actively find ways to solve the raw material problem. There are three main types of raw materials for non-staple foods: one type is unified purchase and sale materials, such as rice, flour, soybeans, etc., required for processing pastries, noodles, dried bean curd sticks, fermented soya beans, soy sauce, etc. For these materials, a processing plan must be prepared in advance and submitted to the local financial committee for approval, and then the grain bureau will allocate them in one lump sum or in stages; another type is materials that are under control of supply, such as sugar and pork required for processing sweets, sugar products, meat foods, ham, sausages, bacon, etc. For these materials, the local commercial administrative leading organs should be asked to solve them in a unified manner; another type is radishes, peppers, potatoes, taro, vegetables, etc., required for processing various dried vegetables and pickles. For this type of raw materials, it is necessary to conduct good investigation and research, find out the output before formulating a processing plan, and strengthen local procurement work. It is necessary to prevent the tendency of blindly processing when there is insufficient or no raw material, so as to avoid stopping work halfway to wait for materials, and also to prevent the tendency of not fully utilizing raw materials when they are available.

    2.  Organize and utilize local private industries and handicraft workshops that have processing equipment and processing technology for processing. For those who do not have processing conditions, the industrial and commercial administrative departments can arrange for some private industries to switch to processing. It is also possible to hire processing technicians from other places, but technical personnel cannot be transferred to other regions based solely on the needs of a certain time and place, but must be based on long-term and comprehensive arrangements. For example, Anfu ham is relatively famous, and there are many local technicians. Southern Jiangxi has raw materials, equipment, and other conditions. Hiring Anfu technicians can not only carry out technology transfer, but also prevent Anfu technicians from being too idle.

    3.  Unify control and appropriately adjust processing forces, and delimit the scope of supply areas. In order to avoid each region going its own way, dispersing forces, and causing overstocking when there is too much processing, and failing to meet needs when there is too little processing when carrying out processing business in various places, it is necessary to strengthen planning, and the provincial company or branch company should unify control, make appropriate arrangements and adjustments for the variety, quantity, raw materials, and processing capacity of processing in various places, and delimit the scope of supply. Taking the regulation of the scope of dried bean curd stick processing and supply by the Southern Jiangxi Branch Company as an example, the company delimited that the dried bean curd sticks processed by stores in Ganzhou City should be supplied to the city and mining construction sites, those processed by stores in Yudu County should be supplied to Ruijin, Huichang, and Xunwu counties, those processed by stores in Nankang County should be supplied to various mines in Dayu County, those processed by stores in Shicheng County should be supplied to Ningdu, Guangchang, and Longnan counties, and Xingguo County should process and supply them locally. This approach has worked very well.

    4.  Correctly utilize private processing forces, verify work charges, and carefully inspect finished products. Some units have neglected to utilize existing private processing forces and have started new stoves, setting up their own factories and hiring people to process, which has caused many difficulties for the unified arrangement of the market. During processing, the work charges and the use of raw materials should be verified to prevent excessive or insufficient charges and waste of raw materials. The acceptance of finished products should also be taken seriously to prevent capitalists from cutting corners. Otherwise, it will lead to high costs, high prices, and low quality, making it difficult to sell. The Ganzhou City Store conducted a general survey of processing fees and raw material usage of processing households, and after both parties reviewed and negotiated, made reasonable adjustments. For example, the processing fee for machine-made noodles was reduced from 3 fen to 2.5 fen per catty, and the amount of salt used for processing soy sauce was also reduced by 13% compared to the past.

    5.  Each branch company and the stores in key processing areas should be equipped with full-time cadres for the processing business, and factory personnel can be stationed in larger processing factories and workshops to strengthen the management and supervision of the processing business.

    While carrying out the local processing and supply business of non-staple foods, the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company also continues to pay attention to the exchange of non-staple foods with other provinces and cities, that is, on the one hand, it continues to organize sources of non-staple foods from other provinces in a planned manner, and on the other hand, it also appropriately supplies other regions with non-staple foods processed in the province.

    江西省贸易公司是怎样组织副食品供应的
    严钊
    为了适应城乡人民对副食品需求增长的新情况，江西省贸易公司加强了经营副食品的业务，因而在今年春节时基本上保证了省内各工矿区、城市和修堤筑路工地副食品的需要。但是，在组织副食品供应方面，江西省贸易公司曾走过一段弯路。
    去年六、七月间，副食品供应情况十分紧张的时候，贸易公司为了完成供应任务，曾分别派出大批采购人员到贵州、四川、广西、广东、湖北、河南、安徽、浙江、福建、内蒙古和上海、等地找货源。采购人员“满天飞”的结果，虽然也找到了一些副食品，满足了一时的、一部分群众的需要，但不能满足群众经常的需要。去年第四季度各省市副食品需要都增长了以后，“满天飞”的采购员中有的常常空手回来；有的虽找到了货源，但由于远途运输，在时间过久，赶不上市场需要，并且运费太大，增加了成本。其实有很多副食品是可以就地取材就地加工的。例如江西省盛产萝卜、菜蔬、芋、薯等，贸易公司自己不组织加工，却派人到浙江去买萝卜干，到广西去买薯粉。江西省供销合作社把十万斤辣椒干卖给了武汉的土产公司，而贸易公司却派人到湖南、贵州等地去买辣椒干；又如粉丝、粉皮、腐竹、火腿、腊肉、香肠等，在江西省内有原料和加工的条件，贸易公司也不组织加工。由于忽视本地货源，本地农副业产品便没人收购和组织加工，结果影响了农民和手工业者的收入，降低了他们的生产积极性。
    直到去年第四季度末，由于省外采购副食品多次失败和江西省商业厅的批评，江西省贸易公司才纠正“满天飞”找货源的错误，开始注意发掘当地的副食品货源，就地组织加工供应。事实证明，副食品就地取材，就地加工的潜力很大。江西省贸易公司去年第四季度副食品加工总产值为第一季度的十倍，为第三季度的两倍半。今年一、二月份，他们继续扩展副食品加工业务，原来只注重了粮食、杂粮、复制品和糖制品、肉类食品的加工，现在已开始注重开展干菜类、咸菜类等副食品的加工业务，并根据副食品大多是季节性生产而常年供应的这一特点，着手储备适当的副食品，以供应旺季的市场需要。
    江西省贸易公司在就地取材就地加工供应副食品的工作中取得如下的主要经验：
    一、要积极设法解决原料问题。副食品的原料主要有三类：一类为统购统销物资，例如加工糕饼、面条、腐竹、豆豉、酱油等所需的原料大米、面粉、大豆等，对这类物资，必须事先编造加工计划向当地财委申请批准后，由粮食局一次或分期拨给；一类为掌握供应的物资，例如加工甜食、糖制品、肉食、火腿、香肠、腊肉等所需的原料食糖和猪肉等，对这类物资，就要请地方商业行政领导机关统筹解决；另一类为加工各种干菜、咸菜所需的萝卜、辣椒、薯、芋、菜蔬等，对这一类原料，则要作好调查研究，摸清产量后再制订加工计划，并加强就地采购工作。要防止原料不足或没有着落时就盲目加工的偏向，以免中途停工待料，同时也防止有原料而不予充分利用的偏向。
    二，要组织和利用当地有加工设备和加工技术的私营工业、手工业作坊进行加工。没加工条件的，可由工商行政部门安排某些私营工业转业到加工业来。也可到别地雇请加工技术人员，但不能仅根据一时一地的需要到其他地区去调技术人员，必须从长期的和全面的安排出发。例如安福火腿较有名，当地技术工人也多，赣南有原料，也有设备等条件，雇请安福技术工人，既可进行技术传授，也免得安福技术工人过多闲着。
      三，统一掌握和适当调剂加工力量，划定供应地区范围。为了避免各地开展加工业务时各搞一套，分散力量，造成加工多了积压，加工少了又不能满足需要的现象，就必须加强计划性，由省公司或分公司统一掌握，对各地加工品种、数量、原料、和加工能力作适当的布置和调剂，并且划定供应范围。以赣南分公司对腐竹加工供应范围的规定为例，该公司划定了赣州市商店加工的腐竹供应本市和矿山工地，雩都县商店加工的供应瑞金、会昌和寻邬等县，南康县商店加工的供应大庾县各矿山，石城县商店加工的供应宁都、广昌、龙南等县，兴国县自行加工就地供应。这样做效果很好。
    四，正确利用私营加工力量，核实工缴费用，认真检验成品。有些单位曾经忽略利用现有私营加工力量，而另起炉灶，自行设厂雇人加工，结果给市场的统一安排工作造成很多困难。在加工时，对工缴费用和原料使用均应切实核定，防止过高过低和浪费原料现象发生。验收成品也要认真，以防资本家偷工减料。否则，就会使成本高、价格高，质量低，不好销售，赣州市商店对加工户进行了一次普查加工费和原料使用情况，经双方复核协商后，作了合理的调整。例如机面加工费由每斤三分降至二分五厘，加工酱油用的盐也比过去降低了百分之十三。
    五，在各分公司和重点加工地区的商店应配备加工业务的专职干部，在较大的加工厂坊可以派驻厂员，以加强对加工业务的管理和监督。
    江西省贸易公司在开展副食品就地加工供应业务的同时，也仍注意同其他省、市交流副食品，即一方面继续有计划地向外省组织副食品货源，一方面也以本省加工的副食品适当供应其他地区。
