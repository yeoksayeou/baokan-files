Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 12th: "Pravda" published on March 10th the resolution unanimously adopted by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party at its plenary session held from March 2nd to 4th, regarding the political situation and the tasks of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

    The resolution pointed out the achievements made by the Hungarian working people in socialist construction over the past decade, and also pointed out some mistakes made by the Party in the struggle to build socialism. The resolution stated that, starting in 1951, we adopted a development policy that was too rapid in accordance with our country's economic conditions and the existing possibilities of our socialist industry. In developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, the principle of voluntariness was not sufficiently observed in individual cases, and necessary attention was not given to the possibility of developing the individual peasant economy. In June 1953, our Party Central Committee studied the domestic situation, made bold criticisms and self-criticisms of the mistakes we had made in socialist construction, and formulated measures to eliminate these mistakes. The resolution adopted by the Party Central Committee in June 1953 was completely correct. In order to implement these correct resolutions, we have indeed waged an effective struggle, but in the process of implementing these resolutions, we have made some mistakes and errors. In particular, the opportunistic and anti-Marxist tendencies of some people distorted the resolutions, which resulted in harmful right-leaning errors and right-leaning deviations.

    The serious difficulties that have occurred in our national economy are primarily due to the widespread dissemination of right-leaning, anti-Marxist, anti-Party, and opportunistic views in the Party, in state organs, and in other areas since June 1953. Under the influence of these views, industrial development has stagnated, socialist accumulation has decreased, and state and civic discipline has slackened.

    The resolution pointed out that harmful right-leaning views are first manifested in distorting the correct policy of socialist industrialization. The June resolution of our Party, the resolution of the Third Party Congress, and some other important resolutions of the Party clearly stipulate that the main means of building socialism is socialist industrialization, and it is necessary to ensure the priority production of means of production.

    The resolution continued by stating that the right-leaning views on socialist industrialization are not only manifested in the fact that the advocates of right-leaning views deny the priority development of heavy industry, but also in the fact that they underestimate the role and significance of continuously improving production and labor productivity and continuously reducing costs. This is a dangerous and deceptive argument that deceives the people. Lenin pointed out, "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and most essential condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." Comrade Imre Nagy neglected this extremely important instruction from Lenin, and often allowed these mistakes to occur, which is why he forgot to view the most important and essential issue of constantly improving labor productivity from the viewpoint of socialist victory. Without the continuous improvement of labor productivity, the country cannot consolidate and develop its economy. Without the continuous improvement of labor productivity, all promises to raise the living standards of the working people are unattainable and empty, and all mean deceiving the working people.

    The resolution pointed out that the anti-Marxist-Leninist right-leaning views manifested in several basic issues concerning the Party's policy towards peasants have caused particularly great harm. In this regard, the Party Central Committee affirmed that it considers further consolidating the alliance between the working class and the working peasants to be one of its main tasks.

    The resolution strongly condemned those pathetic theorists who have begun to deny the necessity of socialist transformation of agriculture, and under this pretext, have begun to adopt a policy of hindering the cooperative movement.

    The resolution stated that this view has greatly influenced the creation of the following situation. Last year, our cooperative movement did not develop in quantity, and even decreased somewhat, although most of the members of the production cooperatives now live better than the middle peasants who work individually.

    The Central Committee believes that it is necessary to tirelessly promote cooperatives and their advantages among individual working peasants, pointing out that this is the only possible road to improvement.

    The resolution pointed out that the strengthening right-leaning opportunist tendencies are also manifested in the reduction of the Party's leading role. Some people deny the Party's leading role in the Patriotic People's Front... Some people advocate turning the Patriotic People's Front into an all-encompassing mass organization of people's democracy, which in essence is to give the Patriotic People's Front a role greater than that of local councils. And everyone knows that local councils are the most extensive and all-encompassing mass organizations and local organs of state power, established by the working people through elections. People who hold this right-leaning view are essentially trying to revise the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Ensuring the leadership and guiding role of the revolutionary party of the working class is absolutely most important for the people's democratic system. Without ensuring this leadership and guiding role, there is no people's democratic system!

    The resolution pointed out that the growing right-leaning views oppose the basic principles of Party life, the entire combat activities of the Party, and the principles of democratic centralism. This is a right-wing revisionist view. If the Party does not oppose this view, then this view will ultimately cause our revolutionary party of the working class to lose the nature of an advanced and organized team, will eliminate the unity of the Party's will, and open the door for the emergence of various factions within the Party.

    The Central Committee then pointed out that the danger of right-leaning is also embodied in the distorted, anarchistic, and vulgar use of communist criticism and self-criticism. The Central Committee affirmed that it is necessary to boldly unfold constructive communist criticism. Without this criticism, it is impossible to ensure that our Party works well, and it is impossible to ensure the advancement of the socialist society we are building.

    The resolution called for a struggle against the most dangerous manifestation of right-leaning - nationalism and chauvinism - and emphasized that "developing deep gratitude and love for the people of our great liberator - the socialist Soviet Union - plays a decisive role in educating our people."

    The resolution also stated that the reason why right-leaning views within our Party and our country have become such a significant danger is that Comrade Imre Nagy supported these anti-Marxist views in his speeches and articles, and in particular, he was the primary promoter of these views.

    One of the main characteristics of Comrade Imre Nagy's right-leaning line is manifested in his denial and underestimation of the significant victories achieved by the Party, and his consistent avoidance of mentioning achievements.

    As Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Nagy, as well as our individual economic organizations, Party organizations, and trade union organizations, did not try their best to mobilize the working class to complete and overfulfill production plans, improve the quality indicators of industrial work, increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and better utilize technology. On the contrary, Comrade Nagy and some other comrades in the ministries misled the working class with demagogic and easy promises in the newspapers, spread complacency and idleness among the working class, and catered to the backward elements of the workers, thereby allowing certain degenerate factors to infiltrate the working class. The main reason for the unsatisfactory industrial work in 1954 lies in this. The final part of the resolution determined the tasks of the Party in socialist construction. The Central Committee emphasized that in order to carry out socialist construction victoriously, "it is necessary to unswervingly implement our Party's general line and the policy of socialist industrialization, and ensure the priority development of heavy industry in the national economy. The development of socialist industry, especially the development of heavy industry, will consolidate the material foundation of socialism." The resolution stated that unswervingly implementing the policy of socialist industrialization is a necessary condition for the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the main way to achieve the socialist transformation of agriculture is to develop the cooperative movement while adhering to the principle of voluntary association of working peasants.

    The continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people requires the continuous increase of industrial and agricultural production.

    The Central Committee instructed the Political Bureau to formulate detailed instructions on the second five-year plan in the spirit of the resolutions of the Third Party Congress, while paying attention to the paramount role of heavy industry, the production of means of production, the further development of agriculture and the mechanization of agriculture, the establishment of a socialist foundation in agriculture, and the further increase of consumer goods production.

      "The Central Committee firmly believes that the battle-tested organizations of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the glorious Hungarian working class, and the millions of working people in our country will realize the great national tasks stipulated in this resolution, which will promote the development of our country and the happiness of our people, with excitement, tenacity, and selfless work."

### 匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议  通过关于政治形势和党的任务的决议

    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议
    通过关于政治形势和党的任务的决议
    【新华社莫斯科十二日电】“真理报”三月十日刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会三月二日到四日举行的全体会议上一致通过的关于政治形势和匈牙利劳动人民党的任务的决议。
    决议指出了匈牙利劳动人民过去十年来在社会主义建设方面所取得的成绩，并且指出党在建设社会主义的斗争中犯了一些错误。决议说，从一九五一年开始，我们曾采取了按照我国的经济条件和我国社会主义工业现有的可能来说是过渡迅速的发展方针。在发展农业生产合作社方面，在个别情况下没有足够地遵守自愿的原则，对于发展个体农民经济的可能性的利用也没有给予必要的注意。一九五三年六月，我们党中央研究了国内的情况，对我们在社会主义建设中所犯的错误进行了勇敢的批评和自我批评，并制定了消除这些错误的措施。一九五三年六月党中央通过的决议是完全正确的。为了实行这些正确的决议，我们固然作了有成效的斗争，但是，在执行这些决议的过程中又犯了一些错误和过失。尤其是，有些人的机会主义和反马克思主义的倾向歪曲了决议，这就是造成了有害的右倾的错误，犯了右倾。
    我国国民经济中所发生的严重困难，其原因首先在于：从一九五三年六月以来的最近一段时期，在党内，在国家机关中以及在其他方面普遍传播着右倾的、反马克思主义的、反党的和机会主义的观点，在这种观点的影响下工业发展停滞了，社会主义积累减少了，国家纪律和公民纪律松弛了。
    决议中指出，有害的右倾观点首先表现为歪曲正确的社会主义工业化政策。我党的六月决议、第三次党代表大会的决议和党的其他一些重要的决议明白地规定，建设社会主义的主要手段就是社会主义工业化，必须保证优先地生产生产资料。
    决议接着说，在社会主义工业化问题上的右倾观点，不仅表现为右倾观点的宣扬者否定优先发展重工业这一点，而且还表现为他们对不断提高生产和劳动生产率以及不断降低成本的作用和意义估计不足。这是危险的惑人论调，是欺骗人民的。列宁指出，“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件”。伊姆雷·纳吉同志忽略了列宁这一极其重要的指示，而往往听任那些错误发生，这就是他忘记了从社会主义胜利的观点出发来看必须不断提高劳动生产率这一最主要和最重要的问题，没有劳动生产率的不断提高，国家就不能够巩固和发展它的经济，没有劳动生产率的不断提高，关于提高劳动人民生活水平的一切诺言就都是做不到的和空的，就都意味着欺骗劳动人民。
    决议指出，表现在有关党对待农民的政策的几个基本问题上的反马克思列宁主义的右倾观点产生了特别大的害处。在这方面，党中央委员会确定，它认为进一步巩固工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟是它的主要任务之一。
    决议痛斥了那些可怜的理论家，他们已经开始否认对农业进行社会主义改造的必要性，并在这种借口下，开始采取阻碍合作化运动的方针。
    决议说，这种观点对于下列情况的造成起了很大的影响。去年，我国的合作化运动从数量上说没有发展，甚至还有某些减少，虽然大多数的生产合作社社员现在已经比单干的中农生活得好一些了。
    中央委员会认为，必须不倦地在个体劳动农民中宣传合作社和它的优越性，指明这是唯一可能的提高的道路。
    决议指出，正在加强的右倾机会主义倾向还表现在降低党的领导作用上。有些人否认了党在爱国人民阵线中的领导作用……有些人主张把爱国人民阵线变成一个无所不包的人民民主的群众组织，这实质上是要赋予爱国人民阵线大于地方会议的作用。而大家知道，地方会议是最广泛的无所不包的群众组织和国家的地方权力机关，是劳动人民通过选举建立的机构。抱有这种右倾观点的人，实质上是要修改马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。
    保证工人阶级革命政党的领导和指导作用，对于人民民主制度是绝对最重要的。不保证这种领导和指导作用，就没有人民民主制度！
    决议指出，正在增长的右倾观点反对党内生活的基本原则，反对党的全部战斗活动，以及反对民主集中制的原则。这是一种右的修正主义的观点。如果党不反对这种观点，那么这种观点就终归会使我们这个工人阶级的革命政党丧失掉先进的和有组织的队伍的性质，会消除党的意志的统一，为在党内产生各种派别打开大门。
    中央委员会接着指出，右倾的危险还体现在对于共产主义的批评和自我批评的歪曲的、无政府主义的和庸俗的使用上，中央委员会确定，必须大胆地展开建设性的共产主义的批评，没有这种批评，就不可能保证我们党良好地进行工作，就不可能保证把我们正在建设的社会主义社会向前推进。
    决议号召向最危险的一种右倾表现——民族主义和沙文主义——进行斗争，并且着重指出，“发展对我们伟大的解放者——社会主义苏联的人民深切的感谢和热爱的感情，在教育我国人民方面起着决定性的作用。”
    决议还说，我们党内和我们国家内的右倾观点之所以变成这样重大的危险，是由于伊姆雷·纳吉同志在他的讲演和文章中支持这种反马克思主义的观点，尤其是，他首先是这种观点的宣传者。
    伊姆雷·纳吉同志的右倾路线的主要特点之一表现在，他否定和过低地估计党所获得的显著胜利并且一贯地对成绩避而不谈。
    作为部长会议主席的纳吉同志，以及我们个别的经济组织、党组织和工会组织，不去尽力动员工人阶级完成和超额完成生产计划，改善工业工作的质量上的指标，提高劳动生产率，减低成本和更好地利用技术。相反的是，纳吉同志和各部的某些其他同志们在报纸上用带有蛊惑性的轻易诺言使工人阶级陷入迷途，在工人阶级中散布自满情绪和游手好闲的思想，迁就工人落后阶层，从而使某些堕落因素侵入工人阶级内部。一九五四年工业工作不能令人满意，主要原因就在于此。决议的最后一部分确定了党在社会主义建设中的任务。中央委员会着重指出，为了胜利进行社会主义建设，“必须坚持不懈地执行我们党的总路线和社会主义工业化的政策，保证国民经济中的重工业的优先的发展。社会主义工业的发展，首先是其中的重工业的发展，将会巩固社会主义的物质基础。”决议说，坚持不懈地实行社会主义工业化的政策，是农业社会主义改造的一个必要条件，农业社会主义改造的主要途径就是在遵守劳动农民自愿结合原则的情况下发展合作化运动。
    劳动人民生活水平的不断提高，要求工业生产和农业生产的不断增加。
    中央委员会责成政治局以第三次党代表大会决议的精神来制定关于第二个五年计划的详细的指示，同时要注意重工业的头等作用，注意生产资料的生产，注意进一步发展农业和使农业机械化，注意在农业中建立社会主义基础以及进一步增加消费品生产。
      “中央委员会坚信：受过战斗锻炼的匈牙利劳动人民党的各个组织、光荣的匈牙利工人阶级和我国千百万劳动人民群众，以兴奋的、顽强的和忘我的工作来实现这个决议所规定的促进我国发展和我国人民幸福的伟大的国家任务。”
