Guiding Chengguan District Organizes Small Vendors to Go to the Countryside
Guiding Chengguan District Commercial Work Group

Last year, the farmers in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, joyfully sold their surplus grain to the state. Before the Spring Festival, they also sold a portion of local products, specialties, and agricultural and sideline products. As a result, the rural market experienced supply shortages and busy purchasing. At this time, the Guiding Chengguan District People's Government organized 129 small vendors to go to the rural markets and remote villages to purchase farmers' local products, specialties, and agricultural and sideline products, and to supply the daily necessities needed by the farmers. For example, salt dealer Dai Faming went to three markets in Ba Township, Matu, and Luobang in the First District and sold 1,200 jin of salt. Originally, only a sales group from the supply and marketing cooperative provided door to door service, and they were too busy to handle the crowds on market days, and the masses had to line up to buy salt; after organizing small vendors to go to the countryside to sell goods, it became easier for the masses to purchase goods and saved time. In early January, general merchandise vendors Liu Minghan, Zhang Chengcai, and others purchased goods from the Guiding Department Store and went to the Changming Township, which was 70 li away from Guiding, before dawn to catch the market. On that day, the two of them sold more than 30 undershirts, more than 100 pairs of socks, and silk thread, embroidery thread, and beeswax, which were popular among Miao and Buyi women. Even in the small Ba Township market, the dozen or so taels of embroidery thread they brought were not enough to sell.

While selling goods, small vendors also purchased some scattered local products for the state. Some vendors carried daily necessities needed by farmers, such as needles, thread, buttons, and scissors, to remote villages for door-to-door sales, or adopted a method of exchanging goods for goods, collecting small local products such as chicken feathers, duck feathers, hair, pig bristles, and cattle bones. In January, the two households of small vendors Hu Bingyan and Tao Chunnan received waste metal and other items worth nearly one million old yuan. This is also beneficial to increasing rural purchasing power and developing agricultural production. In January, vendors in the slaughtering industry and the chicken and duck group went to the villages in Guiding and neighboring Wengan, Majiang, and Chong'anjiang and other places to buy 35,000 jin of meat, more than 700 chickens and ducks, and more than 300 jin of fresh fish, as well as some chili peppers, preserved meat, vermicelli and other non-staple foods, to supply the needs of the working people in Guiding during the Spring Festival.

The 129 small vendors in Guiding actively went to the countryside to sell and purchase goods, which invigorated the rural market, facilitated the farmers, and benefited industrial and agricultural production. These achievements were obtained under the leadership of the Guiding Chengguan District Committee of the Communist Party of China, through a series of political work. Cadres led the small vendors to study twice every market day (six days). The content mainly focused on publicizing the spirit of the general line to them in conjunction with the constitution and current events, explaining that small vendors are also working people, and conducting future education through recollection and comparison, in order to inspire and improve their patriotic ideas and dispel their concerns. After they realized that they were also working people, their enthusiasm for business generally increased, and they unanimously expressed that they would listen to the government's call and actively engage in business. On this basis, relying on the supervision of the broad masses, the vendors who went to the countryside were generally able to obey the state-owned and cooperative commercial prices and market management, reducing illegal activities such as speculation, price gouging, short weighing, and short measuring. After a certain cloth vendor was exposed for selling cloth in Jiangxi Slope without collecting cloth coupons, and a certain general merchandise vendor sold an electric light bulb for 100 old yuan more, the relevant departments promptly criticized and educated them, so that other vendors operating in the urban area were also educated. At the same time, cadres also frequently organized them to study the changes in residents' needs and seasonal needs, discuss business plans and how to do a good job in commodity publicity, so that their business began to have a plan. Most of these 129 small vendors can distribute or purchase and sell on behalf of the state, and submit purchase and acquisition plans to state-owned commercial enterprises on a monthly basis according to the schedule, and implement the approved plans. In their February requisition plan, they paid attention to the fact that middle and primary schools across the country would be starting in February, and purchased more pens, ink, paper, schoolbags, ink boxes, children's shoes, etc. suitable for students. In the organization of business learning, the more important work is to constantly educate them to correct their business style. They also constantly check the implementation of their purchase and sale plans and the status of their purchases, sales, and inventories, so as to find out the problems existing in their operations and guide them in a timely manner. We believe that under the leadership of the state-owned economy and under the guidance of supply and marketing cooperatives, small vendors can be organized through various forms to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, share the task of rural commodity circulation, and gradually transition to supply and marketing cooperative commerce.

    贵定城关区组织小商小贩下乡
    贵定城关区商业工作组
    去年，贵州省贵定县的农民都欢欣鼓舞地把余粮卖给国家，春节前，又卖出一部分土产、特产和农副产品。因此，农村市场出现了供应紧张和收购繁忙的现象。正在这时，贵定城关区人民政府组织了一百二十九户小商小贩，到农村市场和边远的乡村去收购农民的土产、特产和农副产品，并供应农民们需要的生活资料。如食盐经销商戴发明到一区巴乡、马图、洛邦赶了三个场，卖了一千二百斤盐。原来这些场上只有一个供销合作社的推销组巡回供应，赶场天忙不过来，群众要排队买盐；组织小商小贩下乡推销后，就便利了群众购买，节省了时间。一月初旬百货商贩刘铭汉、张成才等在贵定百货公司进货以后，天不亮就从贵定到七十里外的昌明乡去赶场。这一天，他们两个人卖了三十多件卫生衣、一百多双袜子和苗族、布依族妇女们喜爱的丝线、花线、黄蜡等东西。虽然是在很小的巴乡场上，他们带去的十多两花线也不够卖。
    小商小贩在推销商品的同时，还为国家代购一些零星土产品。有的商贩挑着针、线、扣子、剪刀等农民需要的日用必需品，到边远的乡村挨户推销，或采取以货换货的方式，收购鸡毛、鸭毛、头发、猪毛和牛骨等小土产品。小贩胡丙炎和陶春南两户，在一月份收到的废旧金属等就值近旧币一百万元。这对增加农村购买力，发展农业生产也有好处。屠宰业和鸡鸭组商贩一月份到贵定境内的乡村与邻近的甕安、麻江、重安江等地买来了三万五千斤肉、七百多只鸡鸭和三百多斤鲜鱼，以及一部分辣椒、腊肉、粉条等副食品，供应了贵定城区劳动人民欢度春节的需要。
    贵定城区的一百二十九户小商小贩能积极下乡推销、收购，活跃了农村市场，便利了农民，有利于工农业生产，这些成绩是在中共贵定城关区委员会的领导下，进行了一系列的政治工作取得的。干部每场（六天）都领导小商小贩们学习两次，内容主要是根据总路线的精神，结合宪法和时事对他们进行宣传，说明小商小贩也是劳动人民，并通过回忆对比，进行前途教育，以启发和提高他们的爱国主义思想，解除他们的顾虑。当他们认识到自己也是劳动人民以后，经营积极性普遍高涨，一致表示要听政府的号召，积极经营。在这个基础上，依靠广大群众的监督，下乡商贩一般都能服从国营、合作社商业牌价和市场管理，减少了投机取巧、抬价、杀价、短斤、少尺等违法行为。某布匹商贩在江西坡卖布不收布票，百货业某商贩一颗电珠多卖了旧币一百元等行为，经揭发后，有关方面及时对他们进行批评教育，使其他在城区经营的商贩也受到了教育。同时，干部还经常组织他们研究居民需要和季节需要的变化，讨论经营计划和怎样做好商品宣传工作，使他们的经营开始有了计划。这一百二十九户小商小贩，大部分能为国家经销或代购代销，每月按期向国营商业提出进货和收购计划，并执行批准的计划。在他们所提的二月份要货计划中，就注意到了二月份各地中、小学校将要开学的情况，对适合学生用的笔墨纸张、书包墨盒、童鞋等就进得比较多。在组织业务学习中，更重要的工作是不断地教育他们端正经营作风。平时还不断地检查他们购销计划执行情况和进、销、存货情况，从而找出他们经营中存在的问题，及时加以指导。我们认为：小商小贩在国营经济的领导下，在供销合作社指导下，通过各种形式加以组织，是可以经过互助合作道路，分担农村商品流转任务，并逐步过渡为供销合作社商业的。
