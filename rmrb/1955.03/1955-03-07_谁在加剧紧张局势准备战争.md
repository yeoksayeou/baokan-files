The American aggressive bloc, in order to confuse the public and deceive the people, insists that the American occupation of China's territory, Taiwan, is for so-called peace and to ease tensions, and that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is an act of aggression and creates tensions. The purpose of this propaganda, which reverses right and wrong, is, in the words of the British "Observer" offering advice to the United States, to shift the "moral responsibility" for the United States launching a war of aggression onto the Chinese people.

It is necessary to clarify: who is working hard to ease the tension in the Taiwan area and eliminate the danger of war? Who is trying to intensify tensions and prepare for war?

People must first ask: why does the current tension exist in China's Taiwan and coastal islands, and not in any area along the west coast of the United States? Taiwan is Chinese territory, not American territory; it is only over two hundred kilometers from the Chinese mainland, while it is over ten thousand kilometers from the United States. The Chinese people have not and never intended to send a single soldier across the Pacific Ocean to occupy any island on the west coast of the United States, so there is no possibility of any tension caused by China there. Similarly, if the United States did not run more than ten thousand kilometers away from its borders to occupy our territory, Taiwan, and deploy troops and flaunt its military power in the coastal areas of China and the Taiwan Strait, then there would be no tension in the Taiwan area.

This fact has very important significance. It draws a clear line between the policies of China and the United States, and between the policies of peace and the policies of war. China's liberation of Taiwan is a just action to defend the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the motherland. This not only does not create tension but is conducive to defending peace. This has been proven by the experience of the Chinese people liberating the entire mainland and many coastal islands since 1947. This is also a fact seen and acknowledged by all fair-minded people. The American occupation of Taiwan is interference in China's internal affairs and infringement of China's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This has created tension and threatens peace in the Far East and Asia. History has also proven countless times that acts of aggression not only make the situation tense but also lead to war.

No country in the world can tolerate foreign occupation of its territory, support of traitorous groups hostile to it, and the waging of war against it. If anyone occupied America's Rhode Island or Long Island, and supported a group hostile to the United States there to wage war against the United States, the United States would never tolerate it. Similarly, China can never tolerate the United States doing this.

U.S. Senator Alexander Smith said on February 18, "Maintaining a strong Kuomintang army in Taiwan—this is a real threat to mainland China, and Kinmen and Matsu Islands must be retained to make this threat effective—is a very obvious and necessary arrangement." Smith admitted that with such a situation, the United States could create tension and prepare for war throughout the Far East. He said that the troops of the groups of Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Ngo Dinh Diem "must maintain full strength and be in a state of combat readiness at all times" so that they can "take action immediately" when needed. Smith made no secret of the United States' ultimate goal of invading all of China. He stated that the "center of this policy" of the United States is a so-called "free and independent" China that suits the United States' taste, in other words, a China under the rule of the US-Chiang alliance.

These blatant words of Smith prove that the United States is the creator of tension in Taiwan and the Far East, and also prove that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands is not only to ensure the security of the motherland but also to eliminate a hotbed of war created by the United States in Asia and to ease the tension in the Taiwan area and even the Far East.

It is precisely out of a sincere desire to ease the situation that the Chinese government supports the Soviet Union's proposal on the Taiwan issue in the United Nations Security Council. No one can deny that the Soviet Union's proposal was put forward to stop aggression and ease the situation. However, the United States instructed New Zealand to propose a so-called ceasefire proposal and refused to discuss the Soviet proposal. After this, the Soviet Union made new efforts and suggested convening an international conference to discuss the Taiwan issue. The Chinese people support the Soviet Union's proposal to open up new avenues for easing the situation, but the United States and its follower, Britain, opposed the Soviet proposal again. These two completely different attitudes of China and the United States show that the Chinese people strive to ease the tension, while the United States insists on aggression and refuses all opportunities that can truly ease the situation.

The Chinese people's support for the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference is a concentrated expression of the Chinese people's efforts to ease the tension. Since the Taiwan situation is caused by American aggression, the United States has a responsibility to ease the situation by giving up aggression. As the Chinese government has repeatedly pointed out, as long as all American armed forces withdraw from the Taiwan area, the situation in Taiwan can be eased immediately. However, the United States not only insists on aggression but also attempts to expand its aggression, thus making the situation more tense. In order to ease the situation and safeguard peace, the Chinese people support holding an international conference with the participation of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, India, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon to discuss the issue of easing the situation in Taiwan, so that the American aggression does not pose a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. This proves how much the Chinese people love peace and strive to ease the situation and eliminate the danger of war.

However, the United States does not want to ease the situation. It not only openly stated that it is "not interested" in holding an international conference, but is also intensifying the tension in the Taiwan area. The U.S. President's "Special Message" openly stated that it would attack any place on the Chinese mainland. Dulles repeatedly announced that the United States intends to expand its aggression from Taiwan to other coastal islands. Dulles and American generals have clamored to use atomic weapons against the Chinese people. This is the reason why the situation in Taiwan has become increasingly tense in recent months.

Not only that, but Dulles continued to flaunt the strength of the United States at the Bangkok Conference, advocating that the situations in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Korea "be seen as part of an entire situation." Reuters quoted conference attendees as saying that the United States' goal was to "launch a three-front war in the Far East" against the Chinese people with the assistance of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. Can anyone who cares about peace say that these war activities of the United States can ease the tension? No, they cannot. On the contrary, the United States is doing this to link the Taiwan situation with the Southeast Asian situation, making the scope of the tension even wider.

While carrying out all these acts of aggression, the United States also attempts to slander the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan as so-called "aggression." It is reported that Dulles instigated the United Nations at the Bangkok Conference to slander China as an "aggressor" again. But the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is exercising sovereignty on their own territory. What "aggression" is there to speak of? The Chinese people have never, like the American aggressive bloc, advocated occupying American islands or territories, let alone attacking the American mainland. The Chinese people have never said that they would use atomic bombs against the United States. China has also not dispatched its naval and air forces to the coast of the United States to carry out provocations. Comparing the actions of the Chinese people with the actions of the American aggressive bloc exposes the monstrous lie of the United States' slander of the Chinese people for so-called "aggression" and proves that it is none other than the United States itself that is carrying out aggression.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian Parliament on February 25, "Today, internationally speaking, the most important and most dangerous issue is the situation being created in Taiwan and the coastal islands of China." He pointed out that Taiwan has always been part of China, and now some people are trying to overturn this fact because they "do not like the current Chinese state." He also pointed out, "Currently, Taiwan is in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who is supported by a major power." These words of Nehru prove that the Taiwan situation was created by the United States, which supports the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group.

The Chinese people's support for the Soviet Union's proposal to hold an international conference and their welcome of all international efforts truly aimed at easing the situation in the Taiwan area are precisely to seek to ease the tension caused by the American aggression against Taiwan through negotiations. However, the United States takes the Chinese people's efforts to ease the situation as something to be taken advantage of, openly opposes holding an international conference, and attempts to take one step further in carrying out aggression, intensifying the tension, and preparing for war. This fact clearly shows that the Chinese people want peace, while the United States is pursuing war. No matter what arguments the United States uses to confuse black and white and reverse right and wrong to slander the Chinese people, it will absolutely not escape its full responsibility for the escalation of the current dangerous situation in the Taiwan area in the eyes of peace-loving people all over the world.

### 谁在加剧紧张局势准备战争

    谁在加剧紧张局势准备战争
    美国侵略集团为了混淆视听欺骗人民，硬说美国侵占中国的领土台湾是为了所谓和平，为了缓和紧张局势，硬说中国人民解放台湾是进行侵略，制造紧张局势。这种颠倒是非的宣传的目的，用英国
  “观察家报”向美国献策的话来说，就是要把美国发动侵略战争的“道义上的责任”推到中国人民身上。
    有必要弄清楚：究竟是谁在努力缓和台湾地区的紧张局势，消除战争的危险？是谁在竭力加剧紧张局势，准备战争？
    人们首先要问：为什么目前紧张局势存在于中国的台湾和沿海岛屿，而不是存在于美国西海岸边的任何地区？台湾是中国的领土，而不是美国的领土；它离中国大陆只有二百多公里，而离美国却有一万多公里。中国人民并没有、也从来不想派遣一兵一卒横渡太平洋，去占领美国西海岸上的任何岛屿，所以在那里就没有可能产生由中国引起的什么紧张局势。同样，如果美国不跑到离它的国境一万多公里以外来侵占我国的领土台湾，在中国沿海和台湾海峡陈兵炫武，那么，台湾地区也就决不会有紧张局势。
    这个事实有着非常重要的意义。它在中美两国的政策之间划清了一条分水线，在和平政策和战争政策之间划清了一条分水线。中国解放台湾是保卫祖国的独立、主权和领土完整的正义行动。这不但不会造成局势的紧张，而且有利于保卫和平。这是从一九四七年以来中国人民解放全国大陆和许多沿海岛屿的经验证明了的。这也是一切公正的人士所看到的，所承认的事实。美国侵占台湾是干涉中国内政、侵犯中国的独立、主权和领土的完整。这造成了局势的紧张，威胁了远东和亚洲的和平。历史也无数次地证明：侵略行为不但使局势紧张，而且要导致战争。
    世界上没有一个国家能够容忍外国侵占自己的领土，支持敌对自己的卖国集团，对自己进行战争活动。如果有谁占领美国的罗得岛或长岛，并且在那里支持一个与美国为敌的集团对美国进行战争活动，美国是决不会容忍的。同样地，中国也决不能容忍美国这样做。
    美国参议员亚历山大·史密斯在二月十八日说，“在台湾维持一支强大的国民党军队——这是对中国大陆的真正威胁，而必须保有金门和马祖岛，才能使这个威胁有效——乃是非常明显而必要的布置。”史密斯承认，有了这样一种局面，美国就可以在整个远东地区制造紧张局势，准备战争。他说，李承晚、蒋介石、吴庭艳这几个集团的军队“必须保持充分实力，随时处于战斗准备状态”，以便一旦需要时“立即采取行动”。史密斯毫不讳言美国的最后目的是侵略全中国。他表示，美国“这项政策的中心”就是一个符合美国口味的所谓“自由和独立”的中国，换句话说，就是美蒋统治下的中国。
    史密斯这些露骨的话，证明了美国是台湾和远东地区的紧张局势的制造者，也证明了中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿，不仅是为了保障祖国的安全，而且也是为了消除美国在亚洲制造战争的一个温床，缓和台湾地区以至远东的紧张局势。
    正是从缓和局势的真诚愿望出发，中国政府支持苏联在联合国安全理事会中提出的关于台湾问题的提案。没有人能够否认苏联的提案是为了制止侵略、缓和局势提出的。但是美国却指使新西兰提出所谓停火的提案，拒绝讨论苏联提案。在此以后，苏联又作了新的努力，建议召开国际会议讨论台湾问题。中国人民支持苏联这一为缓和局势开辟新道路的建议，但是美国和它的追随者英国却又反对苏联的建议。中国和美国这两种截然不同的态度表明：中国人民力求缓和紧张局势，而美国则坚持侵略，拒绝一切可以真正缓和局势的机会。
    中国人民支持苏联的召开国际会议的建议，集中表现了中国人民为缓和紧张局势而作的努力。台湾局势既然是美国的侵略所造成的，美国就有责任用放弃侵略来缓和这个局势。正如中国政府所一再指出的，只要美国一切武装力量从台湾地区撤退，台湾的局势立刻就可以得到缓和。但是美国不但坚持侵略，而且企图扩大侵略，因而使局势更趋紧张。中国人民为了缓和局势，保障和平，支持举行一次有中国、美国、英国、苏联、法国、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和锡兰参加的国际会议，讨论缓和台湾的局势问题，使美国的侵略行为不致形成对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。这就证明中国人民是多么热爱和平，力求缓和局势、消弭战争危险。
    但是美国却不想缓和局势。它不但公开表示对举行国际会议“不感兴趣”，而且正在加剧台湾地区的紧张局势。美国总统的“特别咨文”公开表示要进攻中国大陆上的任何地方。杜勒斯一再宣布美国企图将它的侵略从台湾扩大到其他沿海岛屿。杜勒斯和美国的将军们都叫嚣要对中国人民使用原子武器。几个月来，台湾局势日趋紧张的原因就在这里。
    不但如此，杜勒斯在曼谷会议上继续炫耀美国的实力，主张把东南亚、台湾和朝鲜的形势“都看作是一个整个形势的一部分”。路透社报道会议人士的话说，美国的目的是要在李承晚、蒋介石的协助下对中国人民“开展三面作战的远东斗争”。任何一个关心和平的人难道能够说美国诸如此类的战争活动可以和缓局势的紧张？不，不能够的。正相反，美国这样做是在把台湾局势和东南亚局势联系起来，使紧张局势的范围更加扩大。
    美国在进行这一切侵略活动的时候，还企图诬蔑中国人民解放台湾是所谓“侵略”。有消息说，杜勒斯在曼谷会议上策动由联合国再次诬蔑中国为“侵略者”。但是中国人民解放台湾是在自己领土上行使主权，有什么“侵略”之可言？中国人民从来没有像美国侵略集团那样主张占领美国的岛屿或领土以至进攻美国大陆。中国人民也从来没有说要对美国使用原子弹。中国也没有派遣自己的海空军到美国的沿海去进行挑衅。拿中国人民的行为和美国侵略集团的行为对照来看，就拆穿了美国诬蔑中国人民进行所谓“侵略”的弥天大谎，证明进行侵略的不是别人，正是美国自己。
    印度总理尼赫鲁二月二十五日在印度国会人民院中说，“今天在国际上说来，最重要的问题和最危险的问题就是在台湾和中国沿海岛屿问题上正在制造出来的局势。”他指出台湾一直是中国的一部分，现在有人因为“不喜欢目前的中国国家”，企图推翻这个事实。他还指出，“目前台湾是在受一个大国支持的蒋介石手中。”尼赫鲁这些话证明：台湾局势是支持蒋介石卖国集团的美国制造出来的。
    中国人民支持苏联关于举行国际会议的建议，欢迎国际间一切真正为缓和台湾地区的局势而作的努力，正是为了谋求经过谈判来和缓由于美国侵略台湾而造成的紧张局势问题。但是美国却以中国人民这种缓和局势的努力为可欺，公然反对举行国际会议，企图一步逼进一步地进行侵略，加剧紧张局势，准备战争。这个事实清楚地说明：中国人民要求和平，而美国却在追求战争。无论美国用什么混淆黑白、颠倒是非的论调来诬蔑中国人民，但是在全世界爱好和平的人民的雪亮的眼睛面前，它绝对逃脱不了它对于目前台湾地区的危险局势加剧的全部责任。
