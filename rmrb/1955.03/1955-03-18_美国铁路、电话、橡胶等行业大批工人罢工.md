Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 17th: Recently, workers in the American railroad, telephone, rubber, and public utility industries have successively held strikes, demanding improved working conditions and higher wages.

On March 14th, 25,000 telegraphers, signalmen, track maintenance workers, and other employees of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company and its two subsidiaries went on strike because the management refused their demands related to health care and welfare. The strike brought rail traffic to a standstill on more than 4,700 kilometers of railways in thirteen states in the south-central United States. At the same time, 50,000 workers at Illinois Bell Telephone Company in nine southeastern states also went on strike because negotiations for a new wage contract failed to reach an agreement.

Prior to this, 9,000 workers at the Goodyear Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, held a strike due to the failure of wage contract negotiations, halting production at the company's three factories in Akron. In Riverside, California, the strike by members of the International Association of Machinists employed by Rohr Aircraft Company has entered its seventh week. Four thousand nine hundred workers in Detroit and southern Michigan towns, belonging to the Utility Workers Union of America (CIO), held a strike demanding increased wages and the establishment of a pension plan.

In the automobile industry, which is experiencing so-called "prosperity" due to the early production of 1955 model new cars, a storm of labor disputes is brewing. According to United Press, General Motors Corporation, which employs 400,000 workers, and the United Automobile Workers (CIO) began negotiations on a new wage contract on the 14th, with workers demanding a guaranteed annual wage. United Press said that these negotiations could break the five-year "peace" in this industry and trigger one of the largest strikes in the United States since 1950.

    美国铁路、电话、橡胶等行业大批工人罢工
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：最近以来，美国铁路、电话、橡胶和公用事业等行业的工人接连举行罢工，要求改善劳动条件和提高工资。
    三月十四日，路易斯维尔—纳什维尔铁路公司和它的两个附属公司的两万五千名电信员、信号员、养路工人和其他职员，因为资方拒绝了有关保健和福利的要求举行罢工，罢工使美国中南部十三个州四千七百多公里的铁路交通陷于停顿。与此同时，伊利诺斯州贝尔电话公司在美国东南部九个州的五万名工人，也因为新的工资合同谈判没有得到协议而罢工。
    在这以前，俄亥俄州阿克伦城固特立橡胶公司的九千名工人因工资合同谈判失败举行了罢工，罢工使该公司在阿克伦城的三座工厂生产停顿。在加利福尼亚州的滨河城，罗尔飞机公司雇用的国际机械师联合会会员的罢工已经进入第七周。底特律和密执安州南部各城镇里属于产联公用事业工人工会的四千九百名工人举行罢工，要求增加工资和制订养老金计划。
    在由于提前生产一九五五年型新汽车而造成所谓“繁荣”的汽车工业中，正酝酿着劳资纠纷的风暴。据合众社报道，雇有四十万工人的通用汽车公司和产联联合汽车工人工会已经在十四日开始新工资合同的谈判，工人要求实行有保证的平均工资。合众社说，这次谈判可能打破五年来这一行业中的“和平”状态而爆发一个一九五○年以来美国最大的罢工。
