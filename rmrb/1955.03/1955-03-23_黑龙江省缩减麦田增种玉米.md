Heilongjiang Province Reduces Wheat Fields, Increases Corn Planting

    In order to increase total grain output, Heilongjiang Province plans to increase corn planting by more than 200,000 hectares this year, as corn has high yields and strong resistance to disasters. Due to the expansion of corn planting area, the wheat planting area in Heilongjiang Province will be reduced considerably this year. At present, agricultural leading organs in various places are mobilizing farmers to revise their production plans and change some wheat fields to corn fields. Many farmers and individual farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations said: This is good for the country and for themselves.
    Heilongjiang Province is a spring wheat area, and the yield per unit area of wheat is not high. Since 1950, the average yield of wheat per hectare in Heilongjiang Province has been only about 750 kilograms, which is less than half of the local corn yield per unit area. Planting wheat not only consumes more land fertility than planting corn, but is also prone to disasters and reduced yields. Heilongjiang Province has more rain in July and August every year, which is the time for wheat grouting and harvesting, which has a great impact on the wheat harvest. In addition, the investment in planting wheat is also large. One hectare of wheat field requires 280 to 300 jin of seeds, worth about 20 yuan; while planting one hectare of corn only requires one yuan of seeds.

### 黑龙江省缩减麦田增种玉米

    黑龙江省缩减麦田增种玉米
    为提高粮食总产量，黑龙江省今年计划增种产量高、抗灾能力较强的玉米二十万公顷以上。由于玉米种植面积扩大，今年黑龙江省的小麦种植面积将有相当的缩减。目前各地农业领导机关正动员农民修订生产计划，把部分麦田改种玉米。许多参加互助合作组织的农民和单干农民说：这样做对国家和对自己都有好处。
    黑龙江省为春小麦区，小麦单位面积产量不高。一九五零年以来，黑龙江省每公顷小麦平均产量只有七百五十公斤左右，还不到当地玉米单位面积产量的二分之一。种麦比种玉米不仅消耗地力大，而且易于受灾减产。黑龙江省每年七、八月间多雨，这时正是小麦灌浆和收割的时期，对小麦的收成影响很大。另外，种植小麦的投资也较大。一公顷麦田需要种籽二百八十市斤到三百市斤，价值约二十多元；而种植一公顷玉米只要一元钱的种籽就够了。
