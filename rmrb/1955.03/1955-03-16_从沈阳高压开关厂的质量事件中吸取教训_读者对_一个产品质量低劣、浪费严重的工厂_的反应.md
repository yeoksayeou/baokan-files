Learn a Lesson From the Quality Incident at Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory
—Readers Respond to "A Factory With Poor Product Quality and Serious Waste"

    Zhang Jing from the National Economic Comprehensive Planning Bureau of the State Planning Commission writes: After reading the article "A Factory With Poor Product Quality and Serious Waste" published in the People's Daily on March 2, I was very angry. The country is carrying out large-scale economic construction and needs a lot of funds. In order to accumulate funds for the country, many factories and mines have launched an increase production and practice economy movement to increase wealth for the country. However, on the contrary, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory has serious waste. What is most intolerable is that Director Zhu Zijian, in pursuit of quantity, led employees to produce substandard products, causing many production units to stop work and accidents, bringing incalculable losses to the country, which objectively played a role in undermining the country's construction plans. I hope that Zhu Zijian and other relevant personnel in the factory will learn from these problems and actively improve product quality and eliminate waste.

    Ba Jiyuan, a teacher at a quick-completion middle school of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, writes: I am an educator in the People's Liberation Army. Our group has systematically studied the documents of the Party's General Line during the transition period. Every comrade has responded to the Party's call for "Practicing Strict Economy" with practical actions. When making the budget for office supplies every month, we are always careful, not even using a piece of paper casually. When teaching, we use chalk until we can no longer hold it before replacing it with another one. A piece of blotting paper is used until both sides are covered with red and blue ink before we are willing to discard it. Not only our group, but also the teachers and students of our school are always paying attention to saving. Although the items are small, we are also saving funds for the country! We eagerly look forward to the early arrival of socialism. Who would have thought that today, when the people of the whole country are increasing production and practicing economy to support the country's economic construction, there would be leaders like Zhu Zijian, the director of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, who treat the people's property like dirt, throwing materials worth more than 700 million yuan (old currency) into the trash can as waste products. We hope that relevant departments will seriously deal with this issue.

    Yan Zhongxiu from the Linhai County Grain Bureau of Zhejiang Province writes: I am a grain storage worker and deeply realize that it is not easy to save grain for the country and accumulate wealth bit by bit. In order to reduce grain loss, we work day and night to prevent rats. If we let go of a rat, we feel that our work is not done well. Now that I have seen the losses suffered by the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, how can I not be angry? I hope that the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory will completely change this situation.

    Yao Naikun, a reader from Harbin, writes: After reading the article "A Factory With Poor Product Quality and Serious Waste," I was truly "shocked." We know how much labor it takes for a worker comrade to turn out even a small part on a lathe; it is also very difficult for every farmer to harvest a load of grain; the People's Liberation Army comrades guard the motherland on the frontier, day and night, no matter how cold the weather is. However, some people are squandering the people's property there. Zhu Zijian is the representative sent by the state to the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory. He himself should know how important the task given to him by the Party and the people is, and he should serve the people diligently. But on the contrary, due to his bureaucratic leadership style and serious individualism, the product quality of this factory is poor, unable to complete the task, directly affecting the construction and production of other factories, and even causing fire accidents. At the same time, the factory's production has to rely on state credit to maintain, occupying the country's construction funds.

    The situation of production chaos and poor product quality also exists in other factories and mines. It is hoped that these units can also learn from the incident at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory and improve their work.

### 从沈阳高压开关厂的质量事件中吸取教训——读者对“一个产品质量低劣、浪费严重的工厂”的反应

    从沈阳高压开关厂的质量事件中吸取教训
    ——读者对“一个产品质量低劣、浪费严重的工厂”的反应
    国家计划委员会国民经济综合计划局张兢来信说：我读了三月二日人民日报发表的“一个产品质量低劣、浪费严重的工厂”一文，非常气愤。国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，需要大量的资金，为了给国家积累资金，许多厂矿企业开展了增产节约运动，为国家增加财富。但是相反的，沈阳高压开关厂却存在着严重的浪费现象。最不能容忍的是该厂朱子坚厂长为了追求数量，领导职工生产不合格的产品，致使许多生产单位停工和发生事故，给国家带来了不可估量的损失，这在客观上起了破坏国家建设计划的作用。我希望朱子坚和厂内其他有关人员从这些问题中吸取教训，积极改进产品质量，消灭浪费现象。
    中国人民解放军某部速成中学教员巴纪元来信说：我是人民解放军的教育工作者。我们小组系统地学习了党在过渡时期的总路线的文件，每个同志都以实际行动响应了党的“厉行节约”的号召，每月做办公用品预算时，总是精打细算，那怕是一张纸也不乱开，教学时用粉笔直到手已捏不住时才更换另一枝，一张吸墨纸用到两面都沾满了红蓝墨水还不肯抛弃。不仅我们小组如此，我们学校的教员、学员也是时刻注意节约的。东西虽小，我们也是为国家节省资金啊！我们热烈地盼望着社会主义早日到来。谁又想到在全国人民增产节约支援国家经济建设的今天，竟有像沈阳高压开关厂厂长朱子坚那样的领导人，视人民财产如灰土，把价值七亿多元
  （旧币）的物资当做废品掷入垃圾箱，我们希望有关部门要严肃处理这一问题。
    浙江临海县粮食局阎中修来信说：我是一个粮食保管的工作人员，深深体会到为国家节约粮食，一点一滴地积累财富是不容易的。为了减少粮食损耗，我们日日夜夜地努力防鼠。放过一只老鼠，我们就感到工作没做好。现在看到了沈阳高压开关厂所受的损失，怎不令人气愤呢？我希望沈阳高压开关厂彻底改变这种情况。
    哈尔滨读者姚乃坤来信说：我读完“一个产品质量低劣、浪费严重的工厂”一文后，真是感到“触目惊心”。我们知道，每当工人同志用车床车出一个即使很小的零件时，要付出多少劳动啊；每个农民收获一担粮食，也是很不容易的；解放军同志在边疆上，不分昼夜，不管天气多么寒冷，时刻保卫着祖国。然而有人却在那里糟踏人民的财产。朱子坚是国家派在沈阳高压开关厂的代表，他自己应该知道，党和人民给予他的任务是多么重大，他应该兢兢业业地为人民服务。但是恰恰相反，由于他的官僚主义的领导作风和严重的个人主义思想，使这个工厂的产品质量低劣，不能完成任务，直接影响了其他工厂的建设和生产，甚至于引起发生火灾事故。同时这个厂的生产还得依靠国家信贷来维持，占用了国家的建设资金。
    生产混乱，产品质量低劣的情况，在另一些工厂和矿山里也是存在的。希望这些单位也能从沈阳高压开关厂的事件中吸取教训，改进自己的工作。
