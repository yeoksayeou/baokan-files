"People's Literature" Launches Essay Contest "On the Industrial Front"

    The editorial department of "People's Literature," in order to express the magnificent picture of our country's socialist industrial construction through literary works, to promote the noble spiritual qualities and selfless labor enthusiasm of the working class, to encourage and educate the working people of the whole country, and to ensure that works reflecting industrial construction can appear in large numbers in the magazine, and to promote the further development of creative activities reflecting industrial construction, has launched the essay contest "On the Industrial Front," widely soliciting works reflecting industrial construction from professional and amateur authors across the country. The regulations for the essay contest stipulate that the scope of materials for the entries should include all aspects of industrial construction, especially works reflecting heavy industry and various major construction projects. Entries should strive to express the large number of new heroes and new figures emerging every day and every hour in the vast field of industrial construction. In terms of writing style, each entry should reflect the reality of life content, and the themes and expressive techniques can be diverse; but it is hoped that all authors will not simply describe various machines and production technologies, but rather depict the thoughts, feelings, and spiritual outlook of the characters from the tense labor and daily life, and express the struggle and victory of advanced ideas and advanced things over backward ideas and backward things. In terms of the form of the works, it is particularly hoped to use forms such as feature articles, essays, communications, diaries, and interview records.
    The essay contest will begin in early March and end at the end of August. Selected manuscripts will be published in "People's Literature" starting in May, and will eventually be compiled and published as a collection of essays "On the Industrial Front."

The film "A Disturbance" is screened in major cities

    The feature film "A Disturbance," produced by the Shanghai Film Studio in 1954, has been successively screened in major cities. This is a film that opposes feudal old ethics and promotes freedom of marriage. It describes the different marital encounters of two generations of women, Widow Li Fu, who has been a widow for more than ten years, and her young, passionate, and stubborn daughter, Yang Chunmei, in a southern rural village. Under the shackles of the "family rules and clan laws" that widows are not allowed to remarry in the old ethics, the mother has never dared to openly express her true love in more than ten years of lonely and dark days; even after liberation, she is still weak and afraid of trouble, and dare not boldly resist this unreasonable system left over from the old society. Yang Chunmei, the younger generation educated by the new society, firmly fights against the feudalistic ideological remnants of a few backward farmers in the village in order to strive for her own happy life. Finally, with the help and support of the Party, the government, and the masses, they eliminated the ideological influence of feudalism and obtained a happy life of freedom of marriage, while also providing the masses with a very meaningful education.

"Actors' Home" Launches Activities

    Xinhua News Agency. Beijing, March 5th - On March 5th, the "Actors' Home" of the China Youth Art Theater became active again. That evening, the theater's actors, directors, and other drama workers watched a batch of young actors' art study report performances here.
    On the stage, young actors recited excerpts from plays such as "Uncle Vanya," "Dawn Shines on Moscow," "The Flowers of the Pear Tree," and "Thunderstorm." The young actor Shu Ruyu recited a passage from Gogol's famous play "Marriage" in the role of Agafya truthfully and movingly. Some actors also recited poems by Isakovsky and fables by Krylov. Some also performed four fragments of behind-the-scenes drama from the play "The People Who Plant Oranges." The theater's director and members of the art committee also came, and they believed that the "Actors' Home" had helped the actors' art learning by hosting such activities.
    Since its establishment in March 1954, this "Actors' Home" has frequently used its spare time to cooperate with the theater's art learning and new play rehearsals to carry out many activities. Such as organizing theater actors or inviting actors from other theaters to report on their experiences in creating roles, as well as organizing performance reports, novel recitations, and art and music appreciation activities.

    各地文学艺术活动
    “人民文学”发起“在工业战线上”征文
    “人民文学”编辑部为通过文学作品来表现我国社会主义工业建设的雄伟的图景，来宣扬工人阶级崇高的精神品质和忘我的劳动热忱，用以鼓舞和教育全国的劳动人民，并使反映工业建设的作品能够在刊物上大量地出现，推动反映工业建设的创作活动进一步开展，特发起“在工业战线上”的征文，向全国专业的和业余的作者广泛征求反映工业建设的作品。征文办法规定：应征作品的取材范围，包括工业建设的各个方面特别是反映重工业和各项重大的建设工程方面的生活和斗争的作品。要求应征作品努力地去表现在工业建设的广阔生活领域中每日每时涌现出来的大批的新英雄和新人物。在写法上，要求每篇应征作品所反映的生活内容都具有真实性，题材和表现手法可以多种多样；但希望所有的作者不要单纯地去描写各种机器和生产技术，而是从紧张的劳动和日常生活中描绘出人物的思想感情和精神面貌，表现出先进思想和先进事物对落后思想和落后事物的斗争和胜利。在作品的形式方面，特别希望运用特写、散文、通讯、日记、访问记等形式。
    征文自三月初开始到八月底截止，选出的稿件，自五月份起将在“人民文学”上陆续发表，最后汇编出版“在工业战线上”文集。
    影片“一场风波”在各大城市放映
    上海电影制片厂一九五四年出品的故事片“一场风波”，已在各大城市陆续放映。这是一部反对封建旧礼教、宣传婚姻自由的影片。它描述了一个南方的农村里，守了十多年寡的立福嫂和她的年青、热情、倔强的女儿杨春梅两代妇女不同的婚姻遭遇。母亲在旧礼教的寡妇不准再嫁的“家规族法”的束缚下，十多年孤苦的黑暗日子里，从不敢公开表露半点自己的真心爱恋；到了解放以后，仍然是软弱怕事，不敢大胆反抗这种旧社会遗留下来的不合理的制度。新社会教养出来的、年青一代的杨春梅，为了争取自己的幸福生活，坚强地向村中少数落后农民的封建意识余毒进行斗争。她们终于在党和政府以及群众的帮助和支持下，排除了封建主义的思想影响，得到了婚姻自由的美满生活，同时也给了群众极有意义的教育。
   “演员之家”展开活动
    三月五日，中国青年艺术剧院的“演员之家”里又活跃起来。这天晚上剧院的演员、导演和其他戏剧工作者在这里观赏了一批青年演员们的艺术学习汇报表演。
    在舞台上，青年演员们分别朗诵了“万尼亚舅舅”、“曙光照耀着莫斯科”、“棠棣之花”和“雷雨”等剧中的一段台词。青年演员舒汝霱真实而动人地朗诵了果戈理的名剧“婚事”中阿茄菲亚的一段台词。有些演员还朗诵了伊萨柯夫斯基等的诗和克雷洛夫等的寓言。有的还表演了“种桔的人们”一剧的幕后戏四个片断。剧院的院长和艺术委员会的委员们也来了，他们认为“演员之家”主办这样的活动，帮助了演员的艺术学习。
    这个“演员之家”从一九五四年三月成立后，就经常利用业余时间，配合剧院的艺术学习和新剧排演，开展许多活动。如组织剧院演员或邀请其他剧院演员报告创造角色的心得，以及组织表演汇报、小说朗诵和美术、音乐欣赏活动等。（新华社）
