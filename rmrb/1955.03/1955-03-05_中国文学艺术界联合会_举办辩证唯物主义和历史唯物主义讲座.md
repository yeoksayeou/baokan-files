Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
Held Lectures on Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism

    On March 4th, at a lecture meeting hosted by the famous writer Guo Moruo, a total of more than 1,200 people from the capital's literary, drama, film, music, fine arts, dance, and folk art circles, as well as representatives of literary and art workers from Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities, listened to Yang Xianzhen, Vice President of the Central Marxist-Leninist Academy of the Communist Party of China, give a lecture on the struggle between the communist worldview and the subjective idealist worldview.

    Yang Xianzhen summarized famous examples of the communist worldview's struggle against the subjective idealist worldview in the international proletarian revolutionary movement, pointing out that only the communist dialectical materialist worldview is the most progressive and correct worldview. Yang Xianzhen emphatically explained the importance of worldview to writers, and, in conjunction with the current criticism in literary and art circles of Hu Feng's bourgeois idealist literary and artistic thought, specifically expounded the class significance of the struggle between the communist worldview and the subjective idealist worldview, pointing out the egoistic, anti-Marxist essence of the Hu Feng clique's thought.

    This lecture was the first lecture on the first topic of the "Lectures on Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" sponsored by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. This lecture is divided into four topics: Materialism (Theory of Practice), Dialectics (Theory of Contradiction), Productive Forces and Production Relations, and Base and Superstructure (each topic is divided into two lectures), which will be lectured by Yang Xianzhen, Sun Dingguo, Ai Siqi, and Zhou Yang respectively. The lectures are scheduled to be held once a week from early March to the end of April. Recordings of the lectures will be broadcast through the radio, and the lecture manuscripts will also be published to help cultural and academic circles across the country study dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

    杨献珍概括地叙述了在国际无产阶级革命运动中共产主义世界观对主观唯心主义世界观展开斗争的著名事例；指出只有共产主义的辩证唯物主义世界观才是最进步最正确的世界观。杨献珍着重地说明了世界观对作家的重要性，并结合当前文艺界对胡风的资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想的批判，具体阐述了共产主义世界观和主观唯心主义世界观的斗争的阶级意义，指出胡风小集团的思想的唯我主义的反马克思主义的实质。
    这次讲演会是中国文学艺术界联合会主办的“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义讲座”第一讲题的第一次讲演。这一讲座分唯物论（实践论）、辩证法（矛盾论）、生产力与生产关系、基础与上层建筑四个讲题（每一讲分上下两讲），分别由杨献珍、孙定国、艾思奇、周扬主讲。讲座预定从三月初到四月底每星期举行一次。讲座的录音将要通过电台广播，讲座的讲稿也将出版，以帮助全国各地文化学术界人士学习辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义。
