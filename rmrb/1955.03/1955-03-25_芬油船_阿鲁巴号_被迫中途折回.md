Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from Helsinki: The Finnish Seamen's Union announced on the 22nd that the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba," en route to China from Constanta, Romania, had turned back to Romania mid-journey.

The "Aruba" was forced to turn back because the American ruling clique used various threats and intimidation tactics to prevent it from coming to China. The United States instigated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan to clamor to "intercept" or even "sink" the Finnish oil tanker. Dulles and Nolan even publicly stated that U.S. warships could be used to participate in the piratical act of intercepting the ship. The United States also sent a task force, including five warships, to Singapore to "monitor" the "Aruba's" voyage. This arrogant behavior of the United States, disrupting freedom of navigation on the high seas, was aided by Britain. The British Foreign Office repeatedly announced that Britain had decided not to allow the "Aruba" to refuel at any of the ports it controlled.

    芬油船“阿鲁巴号”被迫中途折回
    【新华社二十三日讯】据赫尔辛基消息，芬兰海员工会在二十二日宣布：从罗马尼亚康斯坦塔港前往中国的芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”已经中途折回罗马尼亚。
      “阿鲁巴号”被迫折回，是因为美国统治集团使用了种种威胁、恫吓手段，阻挠它开来中国。美国指使台湾蒋贼集团叫嚣要“拦截”甚至“炸沉”这艘芬兰油船，杜勒斯、诺兰甚至公开表示可以用美国军舰参与截扣船只的海盗行为，美国还曾把一支包括有五艘军舰的特遣舰队开到新加坡，“监视”“阿鲁巴号”的航行。美国这种蛮横破坏公海航行的行为得到英国的协助。英国外交部曾经不止一次宣布说，英国决定不让“阿鲁巴号”在英国所控制的各个港口增添燃料。
