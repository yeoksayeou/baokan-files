    Fujian sailors, in their maritime transport missions to support the liberation of Taiwan, repeatedly overcame the harassment and attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, and many heroic and resourceful model deeds emerged. These deeds are widely spread among the sailors and have become role models for the sailors to learn from.

    Forty-six-year-old veteran sailor Weng Wanwan has been awarded first-class merit twice for performing front-line transport tasks. Fourteen years ago, while fishing at sea, he witnessed his father being killed and thrown into the sea by the Kuomintang maritime security team. Soon after, his wife and three children also died in poverty and illness. This January, when Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed Fuzhou, his home was destroyed again. These new and old hatreds prompted him to actively participate in the transport work to support the front line and to bravely and resourcefully overcome the harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on many occasions. One night, Weng Wanwan received an emergency transport mission, and he immediately sailed the ship to a certain place overnight. But on the voyage, three Chiang Kai-shek warships blocked his way. At this critical moment, Weng Wanwan immediately studied the changes in the climate and the laws of the tides with other sailors and decided to pass through a new waterway that no ships had ever sailed before. However, this new waterway was full of reefs and the depth of the water varied. A slight carelessness could cause a collision. If they sailed too slowly, the ship would run aground as the tide receded. But they finally bypassed the reefs and shoals quickly and safely and completed the transport task on time. In performing this task, Weng Wanwan was gloriously awarded the title of first-class meritorious worker. On another occasion, Weng Wanwan was attacked by four Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes while performing a transport mission. At that time, he calmly ran into the wheelhouse, directing to speed up the voyage on one hand, and directing to change the rudder in time according to the direction of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes' dive. Finally, he arrived safely at his destination.

    In a certain harbor, the reporter interviewed Huang Caiwei, an old sailor with a high degree of self-sacrifice. He is an old sailor in his fifties. Once, when his ship was performing an important transport mission, it was attacked by three Chiang Kai-shek planes. The bombs dropped by the Chiang Kai-shek planes exploded around his ship. At this critical moment, he did not hesitate to fold three cotton quilts into six layers and put them on himself, then pressed his body tightly against the helmsman. He said to the helmsman, "Just hold the rudder steady. As long as I'm here, you'll be fine!" As soon as he finished speaking, a bomb exploded behind their ship again, and the bullets from the machine gun flew over their heads. Many holes were shot through the wheelhouse, and five of the six layers of cotton quilts worn by Huang Caiwei were also pierced. But he still calmly lay on the helmsman, protecting the helmsman's safety and successfully completing the transport task.

    为支援解放台湾而英勇斗争的福建海员们
    新华社记者　刘葵华
    福建海员在为支援解放台湾而执行的海上运输任务中，一次次地战胜了蒋贼军的骚扰和袭击，出现了很多英勇、机智的模范事迹。这些事迹，在海员们中间广泛地传颂着，并成为海员们学习的榜样。
    四十六岁的老海员翁湾湾曾在执行支前运输任务中立过两次一等功。十四年前，有一次在海上捕鱼时，他亲眼看着父亲被国民党海上保安队杀死丢进大海。不久他的老婆和三个孩子也在穷困和疾病中死去。今年一月，蒋贼飞机轰炸福州市时，又炸毁了他的家。这些新仇旧恨使他积极地参加了支援前线的运输工作，并果敢而机智地多次战胜了蒋贼军的袭扰。有一天夜间，翁湾湾接受了紧急的运输任务，他立刻驾驶着轮船连夜向某地出发。但在航运途中，被三艘蒋贼军舰拦住了去路。在这紧要的时刻，翁湾湾马上和其他海员们研究了气候的变化和海潮的规律，决定从一条从来没有船只航行过的新航道通过。但是，这条新航道中礁石密布、海水深浅不一，稍一疏忽就有触礁的危险；而开得慢了，潮水一退，轮船就要搁浅。但是，他们终于迅速而安全地绕过了处处的礁石和险滩，按时完成了运输任务。在执行这次任务中，翁湾湾光荣地被评为一等功臣。还有一次，翁湾湾在执行运输任务时遭到了四架蒋贼飞机袭击。当时他沉着地跑进驾驶室里，一面指挥加快航速，一面根据蒋贼飞机俯冲的方向，指挥及时转舵。终于安全地到达了目的地。
    在某地港湾里，记者访问了具有高度自我牺牲精神的老海员黄菜尾。他是一位年过半百的老海员。有一次，他的海轮在执行一次重要的运输任务时，遇到三架蒋贼飞机的袭击，蒋贼飞机投下的炸弹在他的船周围爆炸着。在这紧急的时刻，他毫不犹豫地把三条棉被折成六层披在自己身上，然后把自己的身体紧紧地伏在司舵身上。他对司舵说：“你尽管稳稳地掌住舵，只要有我在，你就没有关系！”话刚说完，一颗炸弹又在他们的船后面爆炸了，机关枪扫射下来的子弹在头顶上嗖嗖地飞过，舵房被打穿了好多洞，黄菜尾披的六层棉被也被穿透了五层。可是他仍然沉着地伏在司舵身上，保护了司舵的安全，胜利地完成了运输任务。
