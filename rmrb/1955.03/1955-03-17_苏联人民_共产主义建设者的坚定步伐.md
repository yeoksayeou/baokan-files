    Soviet People – Firm Strides of Communist Construction
    
    Widespread Application of Atomic Energy in the Metallurgical Industry

    The Soviet newspaper "Komsomolskaya Pravda" recently published a conversation between a reporter from the newspaper and Lavdel, Deputy Chairman of the Technical Committee of the Soviet Ministry of the Iron and Steel Industry. In the conversation, he introduced some of the achievements of the Soviet Union in applying atomic energy in the metallurgical industry.

    Lavdel talked about using radioactive isotopes to protect blast furnaces. According to this method, small bottles containing radioactive isotopes are placed in certain layers of the inner wall of the blast furnace, and then the furnace wall is sealed. During the iron-making process, blast furnace workers use a special recorder to check whether the product contains radioactivity. If it contains radioactivity, it can be determined that the molten iron has penetrated a certain layer of the furnace wall. They can also determine how long the refractory bricks in a certain layer can last based on the radioactive isotopes contained in the molten iron. In this way, blast furnace workers can take timely measures to protect the blast furnace and prevent dangers due to the intrusion of molten iron.

    The Soviet Union has used sulfur isotopes to try to completely desulfurize molten iron. Lavdel said that by putting sulfur isotopes into the furnace along with the charge and taking samples for inspection during the smelting process, a computer can determine how much radioactive sulfur has entered the slag, molten iron, or gas. In this way, the gas and slag can be adjusted appropriately, and the composition of the charge can be changed to influence the distribution of sulfur in the molten iron.

    Soviet scientists have created a radioactive element weld checker. This instrument is equipped with a meter and a special camera for taking pictures of the weld. It can inspect metal of any shape up to 300 mm thick. Any cracks or pores inside or outside the metal cannot escape the inspection of the meter and the camera.

    Isotopes can be used to determine the composition of various elements contained in steel or alloy steel. Lavdel pointed out that it takes more than an hour to analyze the composition of alloy steel using chemical analysis methods, and it is very troublesome. Now, using radioactive isotopes, these difficult-to-analyze elements can be determined in one minute. In this way, people can do in one minute what they could do in more than an hour in the past.

    Lavdel said that Soviet scientists have also designed a radioactive element instrument to test whether the dimensions of flat steel are qualified. This instrument is placed not far from the rolling mill, and its inspection hole faces the flat steel rolled from the rolls. As soon as the flat steel comes out of the rolls, the instrument can quickly check its thickness and notify the workers operating the rolling mill of the test results. This method can also be used to inspect steel plates, rails, and angle steel. With this testing instrument, many workers who do various rolling mill inspection work will be able to free themselves up to do other work.

    Strive for the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station to Generate Electricity This Year

    The Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, the largest in the world, will begin generating electricity this year. The builders of the hydropower station are enthusiastically carrying out the construction tasks for this decisive year. They will pour more than 3 million cubic meters of concrete, and install more than 200,000 tons of steel bars, metal structures, various machines and equipment in several major projects.

    Near Zhiguli, the channel of the Volga River has narrowed. The water-repellent dam on the right bank foundation pit and the three-kilometer-long dam on the left bank restrict the water flow and make the water flow very rapid. In the right bank power plant foundation pit, the reinforced concrete walls of the power plant buildings have already been erected. Concrete is being poured on the fifth layer on the construction site, and the concrete pouring work for the turbine housing, generator water pipe walls, and guards is being accelerated. Every day, the concrete factory in the foundation pit processes 550 truckloads of metal materials, 300 truckloads of sand, and 120 truckloads of cement. Motorized freight vehicles carrying concrete travel non-stop along the cableway. Nine overhead cranes on the cableway swing their steel arms to move metal frameworks.

    A 6,000-square-meter installation workshop has been opened in the power plant foundation pit to prepare for the installation of power generating machines. Powerful machines manufactured by factories all over the Soviet Union are successively concentrated on the construction site. Eight turbines have already been transported, and all the spiral metal housings of all twenty power units of the hydropower station have also been transported. After installation, the height of the power unit and the generator together will reach 40 meters.

    Expanding Corn Production Nationwide

    In order to increase livestock feed and grain production, the Soviet Union will greatly expand the planting area of corn nationwide in this year's spring plowing production.

    The Ukrainian Republic will double the planting area of corn this year compared with last year, with a total area of 5.25 million hectares. (Each hectare equals 15 mu) The Altai Territory of Siberia only started planting 48,000 hectares of corn last year, and will expand to 500,000 hectares this year. The planting area of corn in the Uzbek Republic will increase by more than two times this year compared with last year.

    In order to increase the yield per unit area of corn in collective farms and state farms, the Soviet State Crop Variety Testing Committee has selected 67 of the best corn varieties and is preparing to promote them nationwide. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联人民—共产主义建设者的坚定步伐
    在冶金工业中广泛应用原子能
    苏联“共青团真理报”最近刊载了苏联钢铁工业部技术委员会副主席拉夫杰尔对这个报纸的记者的谈话。他在谈话中介绍了苏联在冶金工业中应用原子能的一些成就。
    拉夫杰尔谈到了利用放射性同位素来保护高炉的方法。根据这种方法，把装有放射性同位素的小瓶放到高炉内壁的某些层内，然后把炉壁密封。高炉工人在炼铁过程中利用一种特制的记录器来检查产品是否含有放射性，如果含有放射性就可以断定铁水已经渗透入某一层炉壁。他们还可以根据铣铁含有的放射性同位素来断定某一层的耐火砖还能维持多久。这样，高炉工人就可以采取及时的措施来保护高炉，以免由于铁水的侵入而发生危险。
    苏联已经利用硫的同位素来设法使铣铁中完全脱硫。拉夫杰尔说，把硫的同位素同炉料一起放进炉内，在熔炼过程中取出样品检验，就可以由计算器判断有多少放射性硫已经进入炉渣、铁水或煤气中去。这样就可以适当地调整煤气和炉渣，改变炉料的成分，来影响硫在铁水中的分布情形。
    苏联科学家创制了一种应用放射性元素的焊缝检查器。这种仪器中装有一个计量器和一个专门用来拍摄焊缝情况的照像机。它可以检查任何形状的、厚达三百公厘的金属，金属内外的任何一处裂痕和气孔，都躲不开计量器和照像机的检验。
    利用同位素可以测定钢或合金钢所含各种元素的成分。拉夫杰尔指出，用化学分析方法分析合金钢的成分需要一个多钟头，而且很麻烦。而现在利用放射性同位素，在一分钟的时间内就可以测定这些不易分析的元素。这样，人们在一分钟的时间内就可以做过去在一个多钟头内能做的工作。
    拉夫杰尔说，苏联科学家还设计了一种检验扁钢的尺寸是否合格的放射性元素仪器。这种仪器放在离轧钢架不远的地方，它的检视孔正对着从轧辊中轧出的扁钢。扁钢一从轧辊出来，仪器很快就可以检验出它的厚度，并且把检验结果通知操使轧钢机的工人。这种方法还可以检验钢板、钢轨和角钢等。由于有了这种检验仪器，许多做各种轧钢检验工作的工人，将可以抽出身来去做别的工作。
    争取古比雪夫水电站今年发电
    世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站今年就要开始发电了。水电站的建筑者们正在热情洋溢地进行这决定性一年的建设任务。他们要在几个主要工程中浇灌三百多万公方混凝土，安装二十多万吨钢筋、金属结构、各种机械和设备。
    在日古里附近，伏尔加河的河道变窄了。右岸基坑上的拒水堰和左岸三公里长的拦河坝，约束着水流，使水流变得很急。在右岸电力厂基坑里，电力厂建筑物的钢筋混凝土墙壁已经耸立起来，工地上正在浇灌第五层混凝土，水轮机外壳、发电机水管四壁和护板的混凝土浇灌工作都在加速进行。每天，基坑里的混凝土工厂要加工五百五十车皮的金属材料、三百车皮的砂子和一百二十车皮的水泥。载运混凝土的机动运货车沿着铁索道不停地往来奔驰。铁索道上九个高架起重机摆动自己的钢臂，调动金属构架。
    电力厂基坑里已经开辟了一个六千平方公尺大的安装工场，准备安装发电机器。苏联各地工厂制造的强大机器陆续集中到工地上来。有八台水轮机已经运到，水电站所有二十个联动机的螺旋状金属外壳也全部运到了。安装起来后，联动机和发电机在一起的高度将达到四十公尺。
    在全国范围内扩大玉蜀黍生产
    为了增加牲畜饲料和谷物生产，苏联在今年春耕生产中将在全国范围内大大扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积。
    乌克兰共和国今年将把玉蜀黍的播种面积比去年增加一倍，总面积达到五百二十五万公顷。（每公顷合十五市亩）西伯利亚的阿尔泰边疆区去年才开始播种四万八千公顷的玉蜀黍，今年将扩大到五十万公顷。乌兹别克共和国今年玉蜀黍的播种面积将比去年增加两倍多。
    为了提高集体农庄和国营农场的玉蜀黍的单位面积产量，苏联国家农作物品种试验委员会已经选择了六十七种最好的玉蜀黍品种，准备在全国推广。　（据新华社讯）
