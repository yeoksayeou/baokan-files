Why is the Anda Dairy Powder Factory Left Idle?

	West of Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, all the way to Ang'angxi, lies a vast grassland along the railway line. Here, the dairy cattle breeding industry has developed rapidly. In 1954, the number of breeding households increased by 2.6 times compared to 1947, and the number of dairy cattle increased by three times, making it the region with the most concentrated and largest number of dairy cattle in the country. In the past, there were no mechanized milk processing plants here. Milk powder, butter, cheese, condensed milk, and other products were all manufactured by hand. Due to poor equipment and low technology, the products could not meet quality standards and hygiene requirements, often affecting the health of consumers. At the same time, the products could not be sold, affecting the income of breeding households. In order to improve the quality of milk processed products, to meet the people's living needs, and to ensure the income of breeding households, the Anda County People's Government, with the approval of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, established a modern milk powder factory in Anda County in 1952 – the Anda Dairy Powder Factory. This factory was completed in November 1953.

	The machinery and equipment of the Anda Dairy Powder Factory are all made of stainless steel, which can ensure that all milk processed products meet hygiene requirements. It also has a large production capacity, capable of processing 24,000 kilograms of milk per day based on three shifts. If all the milk currently available near Anda County and from the state-owned and local state-owned farms in the Sartu area were supplied to this factory, it would only utilize 64 percent of its equipment capacity. However, currently, the equipment efficiency of the factory is only utilized at 35 percent. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the state-owned Sartu Farm, which produces more than 5,000 kilograms of milk per day, and the local state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm, which produces more than 3,000 kilograms of milk per day, are unwilling to sell their milk to this dairy powder factory. Before the establishment of the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, the milk from these two farms was processed by hand within the farms. The products often could not be sold due to poor quality, so they also placed great hope in the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, hoping that this factory could solve the problem of milk processing. However, after the Anda Dairy Powder Factory was built, the leaders of these two farms saw that the profit from machine-processed milk was very high and were unwilling to sell their milk. In order to fully utilize the equipment capacity of the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, the former Northeast Financial and Economic Committee instructed the state-owned Sartu Farm to sell its milk to the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, and the Heilongjiang Provincial Financial and Economic Committee also instructed the local state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm to sell its milk to the Anda Dairy Powder Factory. However, the leaders of these two farms, under the pretext that the price offered by the Anda Dairy Powder Factory was too low, consistently refused to implement the instructions of the higher-level financial committees. The state-owned Sartu Farm, with the approval of the Northeast State-Owned Farm Administration Bureau, spent 1.3 billion yuan (old currency, same below) of investment, sending people to Shanghai to buy a very old set of equipment from capitalists to build another milk powder processing plant. The local state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm only sells part of its milk to the Anda Dairy Powder Factory when the weather is hot and the milk is easily spoiled, while retaining most of its milk for processing into milk powder and cheese by hand. Later, it gradually expanded its processing equipment and stopped selling all of its milk. Now, with the approval of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, it is preparing to build an ice cellar with an investment of 250 million yuan to further expand its processing business.

	The reason why the state-owned Sartu Farm and the local state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm are unwilling to sell their milk to the Anda Dairy Powder Factory is that the price offered by the Anda Dairy Powder Factory is too low. But this is not true. The actual situation is that the purchase price of milk is already slightly higher than the market price, and based on the cost of milk, there is also a profit of 40 percent per kilogram of milk. The real reason is that the leaders of these two farms and their leading organs – the Northeast State-Owned Farm Administration Bureau and the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture – saw that the profit from machine milk processing was large. If they engaged in milk processing, they could easily complete the profit delivery plan. For example, in the 1.3 billion yuan financial plan of the local state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm, more than 1.1 billion yuan is to be obtained from milk processing. Precisely because they start from the perspective of expanding the profits of their own units, they demand, in addition to obtaining a 40 percent profit on the price of milk, an additional 30 percent or more in processing profit, otherwise, they will process it themselves.

	The state-owned Sartu Farm and the Northeast State-Owned Farm Administration Bureau, and the local state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm and the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, in pursuit of profit, actually failed to implement the instructions of the higher-level financial and economic committees, and invested separately in milk processing business. In this way, although the profit delivery plans of these two farms are guaranteed and easily completed, the equipment and manpower of the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, which has modern equipment and guaranteed product quality, are mostly idled. Moreover, these two farms, due to engaging in milk processing business, cannot concentrate their leadership on improving animal husbandry breeding business, and this loss is incalculable. This is a concrete manifestation of a lack of an overall concept; it is the result of narrow and selfish departmentalism. From the perspective of the overall interests of the country, investing more than 1.5 billion yuan in the development of animal husbandry, the farms concentrating their efforts on improving breeding work, increasing more milk, and fully utilizing the equipment capacity of the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, would this not be beneficial to the country, to the Anda Dairy Powder Factory, and to the farms themselves?

    为什么让安达乳粉厂闲着
    龙凤
    黑龙江省哈尔滨市以西，直到昂昂溪，沿铁路线两旁，是一片辽阔的草原。在这里，奶牛饲养业发展很快，一九五四年饲养户比一九四七年增加了二点六倍，奶牛头数增加了三倍，是全国奶牛数量最集中最多的地区。在过去，这里没有机器牛乳加工厂，乳粉、奶油、干酪、炼乳等都是采用手工业的方式制造的。由于设备差，技术低，产品达不到质量标准和卫生要求，往往影响食用者的健康，同时，产品也卖不出去，影响饲养户的收入。为了提高牛奶加工制品质量，以满足人民的生活需要和保证饲养户的收入，安达县人民政府在一九五二年，经过黑龙江省人民政府批准，在安达县建立一座现代化乳粉厂——安达乳粉厂，这个工厂已于一九五三年十一月建成。
    安达乳粉厂的机器设备都是不锈钢制的，可以保证全部牛奶加工制品合乎卫生要求，并且生产能力也很大，每日按三班计算，可处理两万四千公斤牛奶。如果安达县城附近现有的牛奶和萨尔图地区的国营和地方国营牧场的牛奶全部供应这个工厂，也只能利用它的设备能力的百分之六十四。但是目前该厂的设备效能却只利用了百分之三十五。这是什么原因呢？原来是日产牛奶五千多公斤的国营萨尔图牧场和日产三千多公斤的地方国营萨尔图种畜场，不肯把牛奶卖给这个乳粉厂。在安达乳粉厂没有建立以前，这两个牧场的牛奶都是在场内用手工业方式加工的，产品经常因质量不好销不出去，所以他们也曾对安达乳粉厂寄以很大的希望，希望这个工厂能解决牛奶的加工问题。但是安达乳粉厂建成后，这两个牧场的领导人看见机器加工牛奶利润很大，就不愿意出卖牛奶了。为了充分发挥安达乳粉厂的设备能力，原东北财政经济委员会曾指示国营萨尔图牧场把牛奶卖给安达乳粉厂，黑龙江省财政经济委员会也指示地方国营萨尔图种畜场把牛奶卖给安达乳粉厂。但是这两个牧场的领导人却在安达乳粉厂出的牛奶价格低的借口下，始终不执行上级财委的指示。国营萨尔图牧场，还经东北国营农场管理局批准，花费了十三亿元（旧币，下同）的投资，派人到上海从资本家那里买了一套很陈旧的设备，另建一座乳粉加工厂。地方国营萨尔图种畜场也只在天气热，牛奶容易坏的时候，才把部分牛奶卖给安达乳粉厂，自己仍留大部分牛奶用手工业方式加工成乳粉、干酪。后来慢慢扩大加工设备，全部牛奶都不出卖了。现在，经黑龙江省农业厅批准，又以两亿五千元的投资，准备修冰窑，进一步扩大加工业务。
    国营萨尔图牧场和地方国营萨尔图种畜场不愿把牛奶卖给安达乳粉厂的理由是：安达乳粉厂给价钱太低。但这是不确实的。实际的情况是牛奶的收购价已略高于市场价格，按牛奶的成本来计算，每一公斤牛奶也有了百分之四十的利润。而真正的原因是，这两个牧场的领导人和他们的领导机关——东北国营农场管理局和黑龙江农业厅，看到机器牛奶加工的利润大，如果经营了牛奶加工，就可以容容易易地完成利润上缴计划。例如地方国营萨尔图种畜场的十三亿元的财务计划中，就要从牛奶加工方面获得十一亿多元。正因为从扩大自己单位的利润的观点出发，他们才在牛奶出卖的价格上，除取得百分之四十的利润以外，还要求增加百分之三十以上的加工利润，否则，便自己加工。
    国营萨尔图牧场和东北国营农场管理局、地方国营萨尔图种畜场和黑龙江省农业厅，为了追求利润，竟不执行上级财政经济委员会的指示，另行投资搞牛奶加工业务，这样一来，这两个牧场的上缴利润计划虽然有保证了，并且也很容易完成了，但是，具有现代设备、而且产品质量有保证的安达乳粉厂的设备和人力就大部分闲起来了。况且这两个牧场由于经营牛奶加工业务，使领导力量不能集中在改进畜牧饲养业务方面，这种损失是不可估量的。这是缺乏整体观念的具体表现；是狭隘自私的本位主义所造成的结果。要是从国家的整体利益的观点来看，把十五亿多元的资金投在发展畜牧业方面，牧场集中力量搞好饲养工作，增加更多的牛奶，并使安达乳粉厂的设备能力充分发挥起来，这岂不是对国家、对安达乳粉厂、对牧场本身都有利吗？
