The rice variety "Nanthe No." originated in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, and was originally called "Gan Early Xian." After trials in several southern provinces, it was found to have a particularly significant yield-increasing effect. Therefore, the "Nan" from Nanchang and the "Te" from "particularly significant" yield increase were combined to name it "Nanthe No."

"Nanthe No." is not only widely welcomed by farmers in Jiangxi and Fujian, but also enjoys a high reputation in Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, and other provinces. Therefore, in many areas, the introduction time was very short, but the area of expansion was very large. For example, in the Chaoshan area of Guangdong, only 83 mu were planted in demonstration trials in 1950, but it expanded to 410,000 mu in 1953, and further expanded to more than 940,000 mu in 1954. In Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, 200 jin of "Nanthe No." seeds were introduced in 1951, and by 1954, the county had expanded to more than 260,000 mu, accounting for about 46 percent of the county's total early rice area. Currently, the cultivation area of "Nanthe No." is about 8 million mu nationwide. At an increase of 40 jin per mu, it can increase the country's grain production by 320 million jin per year. According to estimates in various places, the cultivation area of "Nanthe No." can still be greatly expanded. For example, Hunan and Jiangxi can each expand by more than 8 million mu, and Fujian and Guangdong can expand by another 3 million to 4 million mu.

Why do farmers like "Nanthe No." so much? This is mainly because it has many advantages that other rice varieties do not have. One of the advantages of "Nanthe No." is that the panicle is large and long, with many grains, and the grains are neat and full, resulting in high yields. In 1953, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, planted more than 90,000 mu, with an average yield of 582 jin per mu, exceeding the local farmer varieties by 100 to 150 jin. The highest yield in high-yielding fields reached 995 jin per mu, more than double the yield of farmer varieties. Many agricultural labor models in Jiangxi Province, such as Liu Yousong and Chen Yike, used "Nanthe No." and combined it with advanced cultivation techniques, with a maximum yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Such examples of increased production exist in Fujian, Hunan, and other provinces.

Another advantage of "Nanthe No." is that it can resist rice blast and avoid rice stem borer damage, and it is also resistant to flooding and drought. In 1951, Lin Qinggen, an agricultural labor model in Longxi County, Fujian, planted 2 jin of "Nanthe No." rice seeds and the local variety "Qingliuzhong" in the same field. That year, the climate was bad, and "Qingliuzhong" was infected with rice blast, reducing production by 50 percent, while "Nanthe No." was neither infected with rice blast nor lodged, and the harvest was still very good. Therefore, the cultivation area of "Nanthe No." in this county quickly expanded to more than 30,000 mu. Later, the farm in this county found in large-scale cultivation that it could avoid rice stem borer damage. The percentage of white ears was only 4.6 percent, while the percentage of white ears of the local farmer variety "Xuehe" was 20 percent. In 1953, "Nanthe No." promoted in Xinjian County, Jiangxi, suffered from flooding during the growing period, and the rice seedlings were submerged for several days. The local farmer variety "Hunan Early" suffered heavy losses, while "Nanthe No." still achieved a good harvest.

Although "Nanthe No." has many advantages, it also has some shortcomings, such as poor cold resistance and easy grain shattering. These shortcomings have been gradually overcome by farmers using improved cultivation techniques.

    农民喜欢的稻种——南特号
    曾观惠
    “南特号”的老家是在江西省南昌县，原名叫“赣早秈”，后来经过南方几个省试种的结果，发现它有特别显著的增产成效，因此就采用了南昌的“南”字和特别显著的增产成效的“特”字，叫它做“南特号”。
    “南特号”不仅在江西、福建普遍受到农民的欢迎，在湖南、广东、江苏、安徽、四川等省也有很高的声誉。因此，在很多地区，引种时间很短，扩种的面积却很大，如广东潮汕地区一九五○年仅示范试种八十三亩，一九五三年就扩大到四十一万亩，一九五四年又扩大到九十四万多亩。江苏省兴化县一九五一年引进“南特号”种子二百斤，一九五四年全县就扩大到二十六万多亩，约占这个县早稻总面积百分之四十六。现在“南特号”栽培的面积全国约八百万亩，每亩以增产四十斤计，每年可给国家增产粮食三亿二千万斤。据各地估计，“南特号”栽培的面积，还可大大的扩展，如湖南、江西均可扩大八百多万亩，福建、广东还可以扩大三百到四百万亩。
    为什么农民这样的欢喜“南特号”呢？这主要是它有许多其他稻种所没有的优点。“南特号”优点之一是穗大而长，着粒多，籽粒整齐饱满，产量高。一九五三年江苏省兴化县种植九万多亩，平均每亩产五百八十二斤，超过当地农家品种一百至一百五十斤，丰产田每亩最高产量达九百九十五斤，比农家品种，产量高一倍多。江西省的许多农业劳动模范，如刘友松、陈翊科等，采用“南特号”，并结合先进的耕作技术，每亩最高产量在一千斤以上。这种增产的事例，在福建、湖南等省都有。
      “南特号”的另一个优点是：既能抗稻热病和避免螟虫为害，又能耐淹耐旱。一九五一年福建龙溪县农业劳动模范林清根把二市斤“南特号”稻种和土种“青留种”种在一块田里。当年气候不好，“青留种”染上了稻热病，减产百分之五十，而“南特号”既没有染上稻热病，又没有倒伏，收成仍然很好。因此，“南特号”的栽培面积，在这个县很快就扩大到三万多亩。后来这个县的农场在大面积栽培中，又发现它能避免螟害，白穗率只有百分之四点六，当地农家品种“雪禾”的白穗率却有百分之二十。一九五三年江西新建县推广的“南特号”，在生长期中，遭受了水灾，稻苗被淹几天，当地农家品种“湖南早”，损失很重，“南特号”还是获得了很好的收成。
      “南特号”虽然有许多优点，但是也还存在一些缺点，如抗寒性较差、易落粒等。这些缺点，经过农民用改进耕作技术的办法补救，已逐渐克服。
