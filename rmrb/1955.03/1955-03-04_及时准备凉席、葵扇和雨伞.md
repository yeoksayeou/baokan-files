The Tianjin Branch of the China National Native Produce Corporation has already ordered a large quantity of summer necessities such as sleeping mats, pillow mats, palm-leaf fans, and umbrellas from the native produce companies in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangzhou. In the process of organizing the supply of goods, the native produce company paid attention to the quality and new designs of the commodities. Among the palm-leaf fans ordered from Guangzhou, there is a kind of high-quality small palm-leaf fan with a bright and lustrous fan surface, which is very suitable for women to use. Last year, many consumers criticized the lack of variety in straw hats. This year, the company purchased a large number of straw hat braids from Anyang, Xingji, Daming and other places, and organized more than 30 straw hat weaving handicraft households in Tianjin to weave various straw hats. Among them, there are flat-top straw hats with small brims suitable for construction workers and farmers, round-top straw hats with large brims suitable for students, and small straw hats suitable for children.

    及时准备凉席、葵扇和雨伞
    中国土产公司天津分公司已经向浙江、湖南、广州等地的土产公司定购了大批凉席、枕席、葵扇和雨伞等夏季用品。在组织货源的过程中，土产公司注意了商品的质量和新的花色，在广州定购的葵扇中，有一种上等小葵扇，扇面色泽光亮，很适合妇女们使用。去年许多消费者批评草帽品种不多，今年该公司从安阳、兴济、大名等地购进大批草帽辫，组织天津市三十多家织制草帽的手工业户编织各种草帽。其中有适合建筑工人和农民用的边沿小的平顶草帽，有适合学生们用的大边沿的圆顶草帽，也有适合孩子们戴的小草帽。
