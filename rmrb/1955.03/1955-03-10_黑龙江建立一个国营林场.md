Heilongjiang Province is establishing its first state-owned forest farm on the grassland of Zhaodong County. Currently, various preparatory works are actively underway.

The task undertaken by this forest farm is to accelerate the construction of the Northeast shelterbelt network within Heilongjiang Province. It will also create standardized forest belts and networks in the vast grasslands of the province's southwest and northwest, in areas where the masses lack the resources to afforest, gradually transforming the soil in this area and preventing natural disasters from damaging crops. At the same time, it is also responsible for introducing new tree species such as pine, oak, birch, Manchurian ash, and Amur cork tree, as well as conducting various experiments in mechanized afforestation.

The Provincial Forestry Department sent a survey team to the large grasslands bordering the northern part of Zhaodong County and Anda and Qinggang counties in the autumn of last year. It selected a site north of Song Station in Zhaodong to build the farm. After the ground thaws this year, it plans to reclaim 50 hectares of wasteland, first sowing grain crops, and then starting afforestation this autumn. The farm will continue to expand gradually in the future, with a land area of up to 30,000 hectares.

    黑龙江建立一个国营林场
    黑龙江省正在肇东县草原上建立第一个国营林场。目前，正积极进行各项准备工作。
    这个林场所负担的任务，是要加速在黑龙江省境内的东北防护林带的建设，并在省内西南、西北部的大草原为群众造林力所不及的地方，营造正规化的林带、林网，逐步改造这一带的土壤，防止自然灾害对农作物的侵袭。同时，它还负担着引进松、橡、桦、水曲柳、黄波萝等新树种的任务和进行机械化造林的各种试验。
    省林业厅从去年秋季就已派出勘查小组在肇东县北部和安达、青冈县毗连的大草原上进行了勘测，并选定在肇东宋站北部建场。今年土地化冻后计划开荒五十垧，先播种谷物，今秋开始造林。这个场今后仍逐步扩大，土地面积可达三万垧。
