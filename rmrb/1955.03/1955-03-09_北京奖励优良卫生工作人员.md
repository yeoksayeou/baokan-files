Beijing Rewards Outstanding Health Workers

The Beijing Public Health Bureau held an award ceremony on March 2nd for outstanding health workers of 1954. Since late January, medical and health institutions under the Beijing Municipality have been evaluating and awarding staff based on a summary of their work in 1954. After democratic discussions, 755 outstanding workers were selected. They have consistently been conscientious and responsible in their work, and have shown great care and concern for patients, thus receiving praise and love from patients. They actively put forward rationalization proposals in their work, studied business to improve their skills, and conscientiously studied traditional Chinese medicine, which played a positive role in improving and promoting Beijing's health work. Zhu Futang, a representative of the National People's Congress and director of the Beijing Children's Hospital, and Xu Yinxiang, director of the Beijing Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, received special awards. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting, including directors of various hospitals under the Beijing Municipality, section chiefs of health sections in various districts, and staff members of medical and health units under the Beijing Municipality. At the meeting, Gu De, deputy director of the Beijing Public Health Bureau, delivered a speech, in which he encouraged everyone to guard against arrogance and impetuosity and continue to work hard, unite the masses, and called on all staff to learn from outstanding workers, work together, implement the resolutions of the Second Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress, and strive to effectively improve Beijing's health work. After the awards were presented, Director Zhu Futang spoke on behalf of the award recipients. (Hou Ximing)
