Fujian Barley and Wheat Begin to Enter the Market

The early-planted barley and wheat in the Longxi Special District of Fujian Province have begun to appear on the market. In Longxi and Zhangpu counties, where barley and wheat are marketed earliest, the grain departments had already collected more than 30,000 jin by early March. In 1954, the vast number of farmers in the entire special district enthusiastically responded to the call to expand winter crops. The planting area of barley and wheat increased by 68% compared to 1953. Although there was less rainfall this year, the total output of barley and wheat in the entire district is still expected to increase by about 35% compared to 1954.

In order to prepare wheat seeds for the farmers this winter, the grain departments of Longxi Special District will actively purchase good varieties of barley and wheat. Agricultural technical guidance stations in various places will also cooperate with the grain departments to carry out the inspection of good varieties.

    福建大麦小麦开始上市
    福建省龙溪专区早种的大麦、小麦已经开始登场。大麦、小麦上市最早的龙溪县和漳浦县，粮食部门在三月上旬已收进三万多斤。一九五四年全专区广大农民热烈响应了扩大冬种作物的号召，大麦、小麦种植面积比一九五三年扩大百分之六十八，今年虽然雨量较少，全区大麦、小麦总产量仍可比一九五四年增加百分之三十五左右。
    为了给农民们准备今冬小麦种籽，龙溪专区粮食部门将积极收购大麦、小麦良种。各地农业技术指导站也将配合粮食部门进行良种的检验工作。
