Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 10th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Ninth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opened in Pyongyang on the 9th.

    The first item on the meeting's agenda was to discuss the declaration of the Soviet Supreme Soviet. The first representative to speak was Foreign Minister Nam Il. He first pointed out that peace-loving people around the world value the declaration of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, considering it a new initiative to ease international tensions and further promote contacts and mutual understanding between countries.

    In his speech, Nam Il focused on the efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the obstruction caused by the US-Syngman Rhee clique. Nam Il said: We will adopt every possible measure to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, welcome every proposal aimed at promoting the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and in this regard, we are willing to establish friendly relations with South Korean members of the National Assembly, representatives of political parties and social organizations, and other people from all walks of life.

    Nam Il said: An international conference with broad participation of relevant countries must be convened immediately to fairly resolve the Korean issue, and the issue of unifying the fatherland peacefully must be resolved by the Koreans themselves on a democratic basis.

    Nam Il firmly demanded that the US aggressive troops immediately withdraw from Korea and abolish all military treaties concluded between the Syngman Rhee clique and the United States. Nam Il said: The Korean people hope to drastically reduce military expenditures in order to restore the wounds suffered in the war and develop the peaceful economy. The government of the Republic once again proposes to reduce the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea to 100,000 each within one year.

    Nam Il concluded: We warmly welcome the declaration of the Soviet Supreme Soviet. We firmly believe that the establishment of relations and the exchange of delegations between parliaments of various countries, especially those in Asia, will make new contributions to easing tensions in Asia and consolidating peace.

    Subsequently, many representatives spoke, warmly supporting the declaration of the Soviet Supreme Soviet and expressing their full agreement with and support for the proposal for peaceful reunification of the fatherland put forward by Nam Il. The meeting unanimously decided to issue a declaration on the declaration of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

    On the 9th, the meeting heard the report by Finance Minister Li Ju-yeon on the implementation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, which was the second item on the agenda, and established a committee to review the 1955 national budget.
