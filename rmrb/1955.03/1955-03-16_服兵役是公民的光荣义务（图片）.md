Serving in the Military is a Glorious Duty of Citizens
Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the order on conscripting and replenishing soldiers last September, the vast number of young people of conscription age have enthusiastically signed up; their families have also warmly encouraged this patriotic action of their loved ones.

The young people of conscription age in Xijianyang Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, have all actively signed up for conscription. Every young person who signed up felt excited and expressed their desire to be a glorious soldier defending the motherland.

The promulgation of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)" has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of young people in Xijianyang Village, Ding County. This is a rural propagandist studying the military service law together with the young people.

    服兵役是公民的光荣义务
    自从去年九月中央人民政府政务院发布关于征集补充兵员的命令以后，广大适龄青年都踊跃报名应征；他们的家属也都热情鼓励自己亲人的这一爱国主义行动。
    河北省定县西建阳村的适龄青年，都纷纷报名应征。每一个报名应征的青年都怀着激动的心情，表示要做一个保卫祖国的光荣战士。
    中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案）公布后，受到定县西建阳村广大青年的热烈欢迎。这是农村宣传员正同青年们一起学习兵役法。
