　　Large-Scale Yellow River Hydrological Survey Work Unfolds

　　The eight hydrological survey teams of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission have departed separately between the 16th and 20th to conduct surveys in various river sections. These eight hydrological survey teams consist of 55 cadres and workers, representing the largest hydrological survey in the history of the Yellow River. The purpose of the survey is to collect preliminary design data for the development and management of the Yellow River basin plan, and to supplement and verify existing hydrological data for flood control projects. The survey work is expected to be completed in June.

　　Before their departure, the eight hydrological survey teams made necessary preparations, extracting records of waterlogging and drought disasters from local chronicles of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces, county chronicles of various counties, and historical documents such as "Xingshui Jinjian," reviewing past hydrological survey data, and conducting preliminary analysis.

    黄河水文调查工作大规模展开
    黄河水利委员会的八个水文调查组，已在十六日至二十日分头出发到各河段进行调查。这八个水文调查组共有干部和工人五十五名，是黄河有史以来水文调查规模最大的一次。调查的目的是为开发和治理黄河的流域规划搜集初步设计资料，并补充和校对已有的防洪工程水文资料。调查工作预计六月份完成。
    八个水文调查组在出发前就作了必要的准备工作，从山西、陕西、河南等省通志和各县县志以及行水金鉴等历史文献中摘录了关于水旱灾情的纪录，参阅了过去水文调查的资料，并做了初步分析。
