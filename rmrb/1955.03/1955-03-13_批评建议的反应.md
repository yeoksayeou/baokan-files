Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    Changed the Complex Business Hours Schedule

    Editor:
      A letter from the General Office of the Harbin Municipal People's Committee: The criticism made by Comrade Chang Hong in the "Reader's Letters" page on January 23rd, regarding the business hours of certain units in Harbin, is correct and fully in line with the actual situation. In order to correct this phenomenon, we convened relevant departments twice to conduct inspections and study improvement measures. The inspection results showed that in the state-owned trade and cooperative system of Harbin, there were not only problems with business hours, but also many problems with service attitude, such as store clerks being impatient with customers, streetcar and bus conductors having a bad attitude towards passengers, and medical staff in medical units lacking consideration for patients, lacking a down-to-earth, diligent, and conscientious work style of serving the people. Regarding these problems, many representatives also raised many criticisms at the Municipal People's Congress, but due to insufficient attention from the leadership, there has not been much improvement. Now, the issue of improving work style and improving service quality (including changing unreasonable business hours) has attracted the attention of the municipal leadership, and after discussion, these issues have been listed as one of the tasks of the Municipal People's Committee in the first quarter of this year, and this aspect of work will continue to be strengthened in the future.

    The units mentioned by Comrade Chang Hong in his letter have all conducted inspections and made self-criticisms. The Nangang Fourth Branch of Xinhua Bookstore changed its business hours to 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM on January 27th, and mobilized all employees to examine their work and service attitude in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and criticized capitalist management ideas. Regarding the business hours of bathhouses and barber shops, due to the involvement of labor-management relations, wages, worker training, materials and equipment, and other complex issues, the relevant departments have been instructed to conduct special research and have put forward preliminary improvement plans to try to correct the unreasonable business situation.

    Taixing Prepares to Organize Forces to Handle Backlogged Letters

    A letter from the CCP Taixing County Committee, Jiangsu: In the letter published on the "Reader's Letters" page of your newspaper on January 2nd, criticizing the "serious phenomenon of backlogged people's letters in Taixing and other counties," especially pointing out the fact that the joint office of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Taixing County Committee and the People's Supervision Committee of the Taixing County People's Government had more than 200 backlogged people's letters, we sincerely accept this and make the following self-criticism: Because we did not have sufficient understanding and attention to the importance of actively handling people's letters, we did not promptly check and supervise, but simply handed them over to general cadres for copying and forwarding. For example, among the more than 200 people's letters received by the County Discipline Inspection Committee and the People's Supervision Committee, more than 150 were forwarded to districts, and only more than 50 were kept at home. Only a small portion of those forwarded to districts were processed, and the majority were not processed, so the superior newspaper repeatedly urged for handling results without success. This is indeed "an extremely harmful practice," and we should take this as a warning. Now we have instructed the County Discipline Inspection Committee and the County People's Supervision Committee to classify and sort the backlogged people's letters, distinguishing between the important and urgent, formulating a processing plan, and organizing a certain force to process and close the cases in batches, ensuring that each case is accounted for and each item has a resolution.

    Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory Has Improved Product Quality

    A letter from Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory: The "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on February 13th, made a criticism of the poor quality of our factory's products, which is very correct, and we sincerely accept this criticism.

    For a long time, the quality of the cast bricks produced by our factory has lagged behind the requirements of steelmaking. The main reason is that there is a lack of a leading core in technical management, and production is chaotic, so the quality problem has never been solved. In order to correct this serious shortcoming, we have successively organized technical forces to go deep into the workshops to summarize and promote advanced operating experience; and with a realistic attitude, correctly applied advanced Soviet science and technology and accepted expert advice, fully utilized the wisdom and creativity of the working class, and strengthened the leadership of the chief engineer over the production technology system; the product quality situation in January has initially improved. We are prepared to continue our efforts to further improve product quality to meet the requirements of steelmaking.

### 批评建议的反应

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    改变了复杂的营业时间表编辑同志：
      哈尔滨市人民委员会办公厅来信：一月二十三日“读者来信专页”上发表的“一个复杂的营业时间表”中，长虹同志对哈尔滨市某些单位的营业时间提出的批评，是正确的，完全合乎实际情况。为了纠正这种现象，我们先后两次召集有关部门开会进行检查并且研究了改进办法。检查结果证明，在哈尔滨市国营贸易和合作社系统中，不仅在营业时间上存在问题，同时在服务态度等方面也都存在着很多问题，如商店营业员对顾客不耐心，电车、汽车营业员对乘客态度不好，医疗单位医护人员对病人缺乏体贴照顾，缺乏老老实实、勤勤恳恳为人民服务的工作作风。对于这些问题，在市人民代表大会上，许多代表也曾提过很多批评，但是由于领导上重视不够，一直没有多大改进。现在，关于改进工作作风，提高服务质量的问题（包括改变不合理的营业时间）已引起市领导机关的重视，经过讨论已将这些问题列为市人民委员会今年第一季度的工作之一，今后还将继续加强这方面的工作。
    长虹同志在信中所提到的那些单位，都进行了检查并做了检讨。新华书店南岗第四门市部，在一月二十七日已将营业时间一律改为上午九时至下午七时，并发动全体职工以批评和自我批评精神检查了工作和服务态度，批判了资本主义经营思想。关于浴业和理发业的营业时间，因涉及到劳资关系，工资、工人学习、物资设备等，问题较为复杂，特责成有关部门做了专题研究，并已提出初步改进方案，设法纠正不合理的营业情况。
    泰兴准备组织力量处理积压信件
    中共江苏泰兴县委会来信：一月二日你报读者来信专页上发表的批评“泰兴等县积压人民来信的现象严重”的来信中，特别指出中共泰兴县委会纪律检查委员会和泰兴县人民政府人民监察委员会联合办公室内积压人民来信达二百多件的事实，我们除诚恳接受外，特作如下检讨：由于我们对积极处理人民来信的重要性认识不足，重视不够，因而没有及时检查督促，只是交给一般干部去抄抄转转。例如县委纪律检查委员会和人民监察委员会人民来信二百多件中，转区的就有一百五十多件，存在家中的只有五十多件，转区的只有小部分得到处理，其余大部分都没有处理，所以上级报社多次催办而得不到处理结果。这实在是“一种极其有害的作法”，我们当以此为戒。现我们已责成县委纪律检查委员会和县人民监察委员会对积压的人民来信进行分类排队，分别轻重缓急，制订处理计划，并组织一定力量分批处理结案，保证做到案案有交代，件件有着落。
    上海耐火材料厂产品质量已有改进
    上海耐火材料厂来信：二月十三日人民日报“读者来信专页”，对我厂产品质量低劣提出了批评，这是十分正确的，我们诚恳地接受这个批评。
    长期以来，我厂所产浇铸用砖的质量，都落后于炼钢的要求，主要原因在于技术管理方面缺乏领导核心，生产混乱，因此质量问题始终得不到解决。为了纠正这个严重缺点，我们已先后组织技术力量深入工段，总结先进操作经验，加以推广；并以实事求是的态度，正确运用苏联先进科学技术和接受专家建议，充分发挥工人阶级的智慧和创造性，加强总工程师对生产技术系统的领导；一月份产品质量情况已初步好转。我们准备继续努力，进一步提高产品质量，以满足炼钢的要求。
