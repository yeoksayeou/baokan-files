    Notarization Work Can Effectively Supervise the Performance of Contracts
    Zhang Jiayong
    Since liberation, many city and county People's Courts in our country have carried out notarization work. In order to cooperate with national economic construction, the focus of notarization work in various places during this period has been on notarizing public-private contracts, with public-private contracts accounting for about 90 percent of all notarization events. Contracts signed between state-owned enterprises and private factories, such as processing, ordering, sales, construction, transportation, etc., have been effectively guaranteed due to the strengthened legal supervision through notarization.
    The general practice in various localities for handling notarization of public-private contracts is as follows: first, to thoroughly review whether the content of the contract complies with national laws, decrees, and policies; whether there are loopholes in the wording of the contract; and, during the process of reviewing the contract, to maintain close contact with the trade union organizations in private factories and enterprises, as well as relevant government departments, to understand the business management of private factories and enterprises and their ability to perform the contract. After such a review, if there are indeed no problems, then notarization is granted. At the same time, the notary personnel also provide necessary education to both parties to the contract, pointing out the rights they should enjoy and the obligations they should fulfill, and that both parties must perform according to the contract. This can strengthen the sense of responsibility of private factories and enterprises in performing the contract and improve their business practices, while state-owned enterprise departments can better operate in accordance with national plans. After notarization, a copy of the contract is generally given to the trade union organization in the private factory or enterprise to facilitate supervision by the workers. Notary personnel also urge state-owned enterprise departments to check the contract performance at any time, and sometimes conduct necessary spot checks. All contracts that have been notarized with these measures have seen a significant reduction in illegal and breach of contract phenomena, thereby effectively guaranteeing the realization of the national construction plan. For example, the Harbin Municipal People's Court investigated several state-owned enterprise companies in the city regarding contracts signed with private factories in the second quarter of 1954 (these contracts had not been notarized), and the breach of contract rate reached 22 to 24 percent; while from June to October of the same year, among the 574 contracts that were notarized, the breach of contract rate accounted for only 2.6 percent. In the spring of 1954, Nanjing took the initiative to carry out notarization work targeting certain industries with more problems, thoroughly reviewed contracts, maintained close contact with the business management departments, and promptly inspected the implementation of these public-private contracts. In particular, due to the close cooperation with the trade union, the supervisory role of the workers was fully utilized, so that no problems occurred in the 366 notarization cases. At the same time, at the suggestion of the court, state-owned enterprises also strengthened management, overcame some shortcomings and loopholes in the past system and work, and many state-owned enterprise departments asked the court for notarization. In the 1954 unified purchase and sale of grain in Jinan, the People's Court took the initiative to carry out notarization work for grain processing contracts. After the contract was notarized, many mills renovated roofs, paved floors, swept walls, blocked rat holes, hired workers to pick out sand, and purchased production tools to prevent grain from becoming damp, moldy, rat-bitten, insect-infested, etc., greatly reducing the past phenomena of misappropriation, embezzlement, and theft. In the past, 61 percent of the flour processed by private merchants in the city did not meet the standards. Since the implementation of notarization in July 1954, the substandard flour has decreased month by month, falling to just over 19 percent in September. In Shanghai, the capitalist of a private chemical factory was previously irresponsible in ordering goods, unwilling to repair the bottle washing machine when it broke down, and the spoilage rate of injections was as high as 30 percent, and delivery was often delayed. Since the contract was notarized, under the supervision of the People's Court and the trade union, the capitalist of this factory bought a new bottle washing machine, the spoilage rate of injections has decreased, and from May to December 1954, they were generally able to deliver on time, the enterprise also began to have a surplus, and the production management system was also sounder than before. Many private factories in Shanghai have also established a finished product factory inspection system after the contract has been notarized.
    The above examples illustrate the important significance of notarization work for ensuring the effective performance of public-private contracts and protecting socialist property. Through this work, not only can we prevent unscrupulous capitalists from violating contracts, cutting corners, and other acts of theft, but also improve their sense of compliance with the law, carefully calculate costs, and strive to increase production to create wealth for the country. Therefore, state-owned enterprises and industrial and commercial management departments in many places attach importance to this work and try to send public-private contracts to the court for notarization.
    Article 10 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The state prohibits capitalists from all illegal acts that harm the public interest, disrupt the social economic order, and undermine the state economic plan." The contract between state-owned enterprises and private factories is a bridge to guide private capitalism onto the socialist road. Strengthening legal supervision at this key link can more effectively prevent unscrupulous capitalists from doing evil. Therefore, we must fully utilize notarization work to ensure that the correct performance of public-private contracts is subject to legal constraints, strengthen the patriotic and law-abiding concept of private factories and enterprises, actively adapt to the requirements of national planning and construction, strictly calculate costs when signing contracts, and ensure that the quantity, quality, specifications, and delivery time of products comply with the contract regulations when performing contracts.

    公证工作能够有效地监督合同的履行
    张嘉墉
    我国从解放以来，已有不少市、县人民法院举办公证工作。为了配合国家经济建设，这一时期各地的公证工作大都以证明公私合同为重点，公私合同的公证约占全部公证事件的百分之九十。国家企业部门和私营厂商间所订的合同，如加工、订货、包销、建筑、运输等等，由于经过公证证明，加强了法律监督，因而有效地保证了合同的切实履行。
    各地办理公私合同公证事件的一般做法是：首先详细审查合同内容是否符合国家的法律、法令、政策；合同的文字条款是否有漏洞；并在审查合同的过程中，和私营工厂企业中的工会组织以及政府有关部门密切联系，了解私营厂商经营管理情况和履行合同的能力。经过这样审查以后，认为确实没有问题，然后给予证明。同时公证人员还对订约双方进行必要的教育，指出双方应享的权利和应尽的义务，双方必须按照合同履行。这样可以加强私营厂商履行合同的责任心，改进经营作风，而国营企业部门也能更好地按照国家计划办事。在公证后，一般还把合同副本一份给私营工厂企业中的工会组织，以便于工人群众的监督。公证人员并督促国营企业部门随时检查合同履行情况，有时并进行必要的抽查。凡是经过这些措施的公证的合同，违法违约现象都显著减少，从而有效地保障了国家建设计划的实现。例如哈尔滨市人民法院调查该市几个国营企业公司在一九五四年第二季度和私营厂商所订的合同（这些合同都未经公证证明），违约的达百分之二十二到二十四；而自同年六月至十月，经过公证证明的五百七十四件合同中，违约的仅占百分之二点六。南京市在一九五四年春天针对发生问题较多的某些行业主动开展公证工作，在工作中详细审查合同，并和工商业务领导部门取得密切联系，及时对这些公私合同的执行情况进行了检查，特别是由于取得工会的密切配合，充分发挥了工人群众对资本家的监督作用，因而在前后三百六十六件公证业务中，没有一件发生问题。同时，在法院建议下，国营企业也加强了管理工作，克服了过去制度上和工作上的一些缺点和漏洞，不少国营企业部门纷纷向法院要求公证。济南市在一九五四年粮食统购统销中，人民法院主动开展粮食加工合同的公证工作，合同经公证后，许多家磨坊都翻盖屋顶、铺地扫墙、堵塞鼠洞、雇工拣沙、购置生产工具，以防粮食潮湿、霉烂、鼠咬、虫蛀等情况发生，大大减少了过去挪用、侵吞、偷盗的现象。过去该市委托私商加工的面粉，不合规格的占百分之六十一强，自一九五四年七月实行公证后，不合规格的面粉逐月减少，九月份下降到百分之十九强。上海市有个私营化药厂的资本家，以前在订货时不负责任，洗瓶机坏了不愿修理，针剂的污损率高达百分之三十，经常延期交货。自合同经过公证后，这个厂的资本家在人民法院和工会的监督下，买了新的洗瓶机，针剂污损率已有下降，从一九五四年五月到十二月，一般都能如期交货，企业也开始有了盈余，生产管理制度也比以前健全了。上海市不少私营工厂在合同经过公证后，还建立了成品出厂检验制度。
    以上事例说明了公证工作对于保证公私合同的切实履行和保护社会主义财产的重要意义。通过这项工作不但可以防止不法资本家违反合同、偷工减料和其他盗窃行为，还可以提高他们的守法思想，认真核算成本，努力增加生产，为国家创造财富。因此，不少地方的国营企业和工商管理部门，都重视这一工作，尽量把公私合同送请法院公证。
    中华人民共和国宪法第十条内规定：“国家禁止资本家的危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为。”国家企业和私人厂商间的合同，是引导私人资本主义步入社会主义道路的一条桥梁，在这一要害环节上加强法律监督，就可以比较有效地防止不法资本家为非作歹，因之我们必须充分运用公证工作，使公私合同的正确履行受到法律上的约束，加强私人厂商的爱国守法观念，积极地适应国家计划建设的要求，在签订合同时严格核算成本，在履行合同时保证产品数量、质量、规格、交货时间等方面符合合同的规定。
