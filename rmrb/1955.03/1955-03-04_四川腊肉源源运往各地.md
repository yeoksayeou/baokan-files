Sichuan Preserved Pork is Continuously Shipped to Various Regions

Spring is the peak sales season for preserved pork. The Sichuan Provincial Company of China National Foodstuffs Import & Export Corporation is currently transporting large quantities of preserved pork to major cities and industrial and mining areas across the country via land and water routes. As of early February, over 7.7 million jin of salted preserved pork have been supplied to twelve provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, as well as some major industrial and mining areas and forest regions.

Sichuan Province ranks first in the country in terms of hog production. However, due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in external transport, a large amount of preserved pork is processed every winter and then sold to various regions. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Sichuan Provincial Company of China National Foodstuffs Import & Export Corporation signed preserved pork supply and sales contracts with twelve provinces and cities in advance. According to the specifications required by various regions, the company separately organized the main pig-producing areas in the province—Fuling, Wanxian, Daxian, Yibin, and Changshou—to process and produce the pork. From the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Food Company and Trade Company plan to organize the processing of preserved pork, accounting for about 15 percent of the province's total annual hog purchase volume. Currently, preserved pork processing plants in various regions are actively carrying out processing and curing work. (Song Zhi)

    四川腊肉源源运往各地
    春季是腊肉的旺销季节。中国食品公司四川省公司现在正从陆路和水路，把大量腊肉源源运往全国各大城市和工矿区。到二月上旬为止，供应给北京、上海、天津、辽宁、黑龙江等十二个省市和一些主要工矿区、林区的咸腊肉，已经有七百多万斤。
    四川省毛猪产量占全国第一位，但是由于交通不便，外运困难，每年冬季都要加工大量腊肉，然后外销各地。去年第四季度，中国食品公司四川省公司预先同全国十二个省市签订了腊肉供销合同，并按照各地要求的规格，分别组织省内主要产猪区——涪陵、万县、达县、宜宾、长寿等地加工生产。从去年第四季度到今年第一季度，四川省食品公司和贸易公司计划组织加工的腊肉，占省内全年毛猪收购量的百分之十五左右。现在，各地腊肉加工厂还正在积极进行加工腌制工作。（宋志）
