The results of the Japanese general election have been announced.

As in previous general elections, there are various restrictions on the people's participation. Of Japan's population of over 80 million, only approximately 48 million have the right to vote, and the February 27th election saw only 37,404,507 votes cast. Many voters expressed indifference to the election, even abstaining. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo stated that some voters "preferred to admire plum blossoms in the countryside rather than go to the polls." On the other hand, candidates' campaign activities were subject to surveillance everywhere, and any action could be deemed a violation of election regulations. According to Kyodo News, as of February 28th, police across the country had investigated 1,181 cases of election law violations, with 2,066 people arrested, and 45 candidates interrogated after voluntarily reporting themselves. Of course, Japan's progressive forces were particularly persecuted. In Kumamoto Prefecture, a Japanese Communist Party candidate was beaten by fascist thugs.

Under such an electoral landscape, the results of the general election, with the number of seats won by each party in the House of Representatives, are as follows: Democratic Party 185 seats, Liberal Party 112 seats, Left-wing Socialist Party 89 seats, Right-wing Socialist Party 67 seats, Labor-Farmer Party 4 seats, Japanese Communist Party 2 seats, small parties 2 seats, independents 6 seats, totaling 467 seats.

Compared to before the election, in terms of the conservative parties, the Democratic Party was victorious and the Liberal Party suffered a crushing defeat. In terms of the overall result, it reflects a decline in the strength of the conservative parties, while the strength of the left and right-wing Socialist Parties and other left-wing parties is increasing.

The results of this general election show that the Japanese people are demanding peace. Before the election, both the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party advocated revising the constitutional provisions regarding the renunciation of war, attempting to accelerate the arming of Japan. According to Article 96 of the Constitution, amending the Constitution requires the support of two-thirds of all members of parliament to be proposed. If these two conservative parties had won two-thirds of the seats in this general election, the Constitution would have been amended, and the Japanese government would have been able to expand the Japanese army under the command of the United States without restraint. Shiga Yoshio, one of the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, stated in an interview with reporters on February 25th that amending the Constitution would pave the way for war, and this general election must "prevent the amendment of the Constitution." From this perspective, we cannot view the number of seats won by each party in this general election in isolation; we must recognize that this general election is a struggle between two forces—the forces of peace and the forces of war—and it is a struggle between two futures—a peaceful future and a future of war. The election results show that the Japanese people are opposed to war, and the election has prevented the amendment of the Constitution. The four parties that oppose amending the Constitution—the Left-wing Socialist Party, the Right-wing Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Japanese Communist Party—won a total of 162 seats, achieving a victory exceeding one-third of all seats.

The results of this general election show that the Japanese people are demanding independence. This can be seen from the Liberal Party's crushing defeat. The Liberal Party, headed by Yoshida, during its term in office, disregarded the self-respect of the Japanese nation and thoroughly pursued a policy of the United States enslaving Japan. After Yoshida stepped down, the Liberal Party, under the leadership of Ogata Taketora, continued to play Yoshida's old tune as its campaign platform. As a result of the general election, the Liberal Party's strength plummeted to only 112 seats. This number is not only 68 seats less than before the election, but also the fewest seats the Liberal Party has won in any general election since 1946. In its heyday, the Liberal Party had 285 members, exceeding half of all seats. In the October 1952 general election, it still won 240 seats, and in the April 1953 general election, it dropped to 199 seats. This general election saw it drop again to 112 seats. The Liberal Party's ever-declining strength shows that the Japanese people are increasingly dissatisfied with its policy of betraying national interests, and it also shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to control Japan. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on February 28th, U.S. officials believe that this general election "shows that post-war Japan's independent sentiment is growing." The words of Washington officials are not difficult to understand.

The results of this general election show that the Japanese people urgently demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. The Japanese people are generally concerned about the issue of Japan restoring diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. Whether it is a political party's campaign platform or a candidate's speech, as long as they openly advocate for the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, it can help them win votes. It is undeniable that the number of votes obtained by each party in this election is closely related to their attitude towards restoring diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. This factor not only increased the number of votes obtained by the left and right-wing Socialist Parties, but also a large portion of the votes obtained by the Democratic Party came from its promise to restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. A clear contrast can be found in the fact that Okazaki Katsuo, the former foreign minister of the Yoshida cabinet, who was famous for being "absolutely pro-American," was defeated in this general election. This is the Japanese people's verdict on Okazaki's diplomacy—that is, on Yoshida's diplomacy; this should be taken as a lesson, the inevitable end of following the American line.

It should be pointed out that the election results not only announced the decline of the Liberal Party, but also marked the ebb of the conservative parties' power. Before the election, the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party had a total of 304 members; after the election, they had only 297, losing seven seats. In the April 1949 general election, the two parties had a total of 333 seats; in the October 1952 general election, the two parties still had 325 seats, but this general election saw them drop to 297 seats.

Under the situation of the conservative parties' power ebbing, the Democratic Party seized the Liberal Party's votes, increasing its seats by 61, and leaping to become the largest party in parliament. The Democratic Party has taken the place of the Liberal Party. However, the Democratic Party's hope of obtaining a majority of seats in parliament did not succeed, and it cannot form a single-party cabinet. Even if it forms a cabinet alone, the new cabinet's policies cannot be dictated by one party. Washington officials quickly hinted to the Democratic Party, saying that without the support of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama "would find it difficult to form a strong and stable government." (Reuters, Washington, February 28th) People are paying attention to the influence of American pressure on the future political situation in Japan, paying attention to whether the Democratic Party will rely on the Liberal Party or even merge with the Liberal Party, and paying attention to whether the Democratic Party will still follow the path of Yoshida's policies and repeat the mistakes of the Yoshida cabinet. The results of the general election have already told the Democratic Party, and the history of the Liberal Party's rule is also telling the Democratic Party that the Japanese people demand national independence and world peace, demand to get rid of Japan's semi-occupied status, and demand the rapid restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. This will is unstoppable, and this trend is unstoppable. Japan's enlightened people have all seen this inevitable trend in Japan. Democratic Party leaders such as Hatoyama Ichiro have also seen it. They have made many promises to the voters. The question is whether the promises will be fulfilled. This is a test for a party that has gone from being in opposition to being in power.

It should be pointed out that the two Socialist Parties combined won 156 seats, an increase of 21 seats compared to before the election, with the Left-wing Socialist Party increasing by 15 seats and the Right-wing Socialist Party increasing by 6 seats. The different number of seats increased by the left and right-wing Socialist Parties reflects the difference in the minds of the people between the words and deeds and policies of the two parties. However, the two Socialist Parties have already announced that they will merge after the election, and their united strength will occupy the position of the second largest party in parliament. In the April 1947 general election, the Socialist Party won only 143 seats. At that time, this number was already the largest party in the Japanese parliament, and it formed the Katayama cabinet. Now, the absolute number and proportion of seats occupied by the two Socialist Parties have exceeded the Katayama cabinet at that time in 1947. This victory of the Japanese Socialist Party is unprecedented.

The victory of the left and right-wing Socialist Parties is inseparable from the help of the Japanese Communist Party. As early as December 7th of last year before the election, the Japanese Communist Party put forward its campaign program, calling on all patriots to unite and carry out the election struggle for peace and independence. The Japanese Communist Party's election work and political influence mobilized the broad masses of the people, pointed out the future of the Japanese nation and the current goals of struggle, and enhanced the people's enthusiasm for struggle. On the eve of the general election, in order to avoid dispersing the forces of peace and democracy in the same electoral district, the Japanese Communist Party voluntarily withdrew its 39 candidates, concentrating votes on other left-wing parties to help them get elected. This is an important factor in the victory of the left and right-wing Socialist Parties, which enabled the four democratic parties to win more than one-third of all seats. The Japanese Communist Party played a decisive role in defeating the conservative parties' conspiracy to amend the Constitution and achieving victory in this general election.

The Japanese general election has been announced. No matter which party or person comes out to form a new cabinet, there are two paths placed before Japan: one is the path of dependence on the United States and moving towards war that Yoshida took; the other is to find strength in the Japanese people and resolutely move towards independence and peace. The new cabinet must choose one of the two paths. If it takes the path of dependence on the United States, it will inevitably move towards Yoshida's fate; if it takes the path of independence and peace, it will not only be supported by the Japanese people, but also be welcomed by the Chinese people and the people of Asia.

    评日本大选
    李纯青
    日本大选的结果已经揭晓了。
    像历次大选一样，选举对于人民是有各种限制的。日本八千多万人口，只有约四千八百万人有选举权，而二月二十七日大选统计，只投了三千七百万四千五百零七票。不少选民对大选表示冷淡，甚至弃权。法新社东京电说：有些选民“宁愿在乡下欣赏李花，不愿到投票站去。”另一方面，候选人的竞选活动到处受到监视，动不动就是违反选举法规。据共同社报道，截至二月二十八日止，全国警察已检举出违反选举法案件一千一百八十一起，有二千零六十六人被捕，还有四十五个候选人以自行报到的形式受到审讯。当然，日本进步力量是会格外受到迫害的。在熊本县的日本共产党候选人就曾遭受法西斯暴徒的殴打。
    在这样的大选风景下，得出这样的大选结果，各党派当选众议院议员人数如下：民主党一八五席，自由党一一二席，左派社会党八九席，右派社会党六七席，劳农党四席，日本共产党二席，小党派二席，无党派六席，共四六七席。
    和大选以前比较，保守党派方面是，民主党胜利，自由党惨败；就整个结果而言，表现着保守党派的势力下降了，而左右派社会党及其他左翼党派的势力正在上涨。
    这次大选结果，表明了日本人民是要求和平的。在大选以前，自由党和民主党都主张修改宪法关于弃绝战争的规定，企图加紧武装日本。根据宪法第九十六条的规定，修改宪法必须有全体议员三分之二的票数赞成才能提议。如果这两个保守党派在这次大选中取得三分之二的议席，宪法便将被修改，日本政府便可以放手扩张在美国指挥下的日本军队。日共领导人之一志贺义雄在二月二十五日对记者谈话中曾指出，修改宪法将是为战争铺平道路，这次大选必须“阻止修改宪法”。从这方面说，我们不可以把这次大选各党派所得席数孤立看待，应该认识这次大选是两个力量——和平力量和战争力量的斗争，它是两个前途——和平前途和战争前途的斗争，而大选结果表明：日本人民是反对战争的，大选已经阻止了修改宪法的作用，反对修改宪法的四个党派左派社会党、右派社会党、劳农党和日本共产党一共得到一百六十二个议席，取得了超过全部议席三分之一的胜利。
    这次大选的结果，表明日本人民是要求独立的。从自由党的惨败可以说明。以吉田为首的自由党，在它执政期间，不顾日本民族的自尊心，彻底奉行美国奴役日本的政策。吉田下野后，自由党在绪方竹虎领导下，仍然弹着吉田的老调，作为竞选的纲领。而大选结果，自由党势力一落千丈，只得一一二议席，这个数字不但比大选前减少六十八席，而且是从一九四六年以来在历次大选中自由党所得席数最少的一次。自由党在全盛时期，曾拥有议员二八五名，超过全部议席的半数，一九五二年十月大选，也还得到二四○席，一九五三年四月大选就降为一九九席了，这次大选又降为一一二席。自由党党势的每况愈下，说明着日本人民对它的出卖民族利益的政策愈来愈不满，也说明着美国控制日本已经愈来愈困难了。据华盛顿美联社二月二十八日电，美国官员对这次大选，认为是“表明战后日本的独立情绪正在增长”。华盛顿官员的话是不难理解的。
    这次大选结果，表明日本人民迫切要求和中苏两国恢复邦交。日本人民普遍关心日本和中苏恢复邦交的问题。不管是政党的竞选纲领，或是候选人的谈话，只要公开主张恢复中苏邦交，就都可以帮助他们赢得选票。无可否认，这次各党派所得选票，和他们对恢复中苏邦交的态度有着密切的关系；这个因素不但使左右派社会党的得票数增加，就是民主党所得选票，也有很大部分是从它所作的愿意恢复中苏邦交的诺言取来的。人们可以找到一个明显的对照，那就是以“绝对亲美”著名的前吉田内阁外相冈崎胜男，在这次大选中，他落选了。这是日本人民对冈崎外交——也就是对吉田外交的宣判；这是应该引为教训的，走美国路线的必然下场。
    应该指出，大选结果不仅是宣告自由党的没落，而且标志着保守党派势力在退潮。大选前，自由党和民主党共有议员三○四名，大选后只有二九七名，丧失了七个席位。在一九四九年四月大选时，它们两党共得三三三席；一九五二年十月大选，它们两党也还得到三二五席，这次大选降为二九七席了。
    在保守党派势力退潮的情势之下，民主党以夺得自由党的选票，增加了六十一个议席，一跃而为议会第一大党。民主党已取自由党的地位而代之。但是民主党希望取得议会过半数的席位并没有成功，不能组织一党内阁，即使单独组阁，新内阁的政策也不能由它一党独行其是。华盛顿的官员已经很快向民主党暗示，说，如果没有自由党的支持，鸠山“就很难组成一个强大稳定的政府。”（路透社华盛顿二月二十八日电）人们在注意着美国压力对于今后日本政局的影响，注意着民主党是否依靠自由党以至和自由党合并，注意着民主党是否仍走吉田政策的道路，重蹈吉田内阁的覆辙？大选的结果已经告诉民主党，自由党执政的历史也在告诉民主党：日本人民要求民族独立和世界和平，要求摆脱日本国家半被占领的地位，要求迅速和中苏恢复邦交，这种意志是不可压抑的，这种趋势是不可阻止的。日本的有识之士都已看到日本这种必然趋势，民主党的领导人物如鸠山一郎等也当已看到，他们对选民许下了许多诺言，问题在诺言是否兑现，这对一个从在野到在朝的政党是一种考验。
    应该指出，两派社会党合计当选议员一五六名，比大选前增加了二十一名，其中左派社会党增加十五名，右派社会党增加六名。左右派社会党增加的席数不同，反映着两派社会党的言行和政策在人民心目中的差别。但是两派社会党已经宣布在大选后将合并，他们团结起来的力量在议会中将占第二大党的地位。一九四七年四月大选，社会党当选议员不过一四三名，当时这个数目已经是日本议会的第一大党，并由此组织了片山内阁。现在两派社会党所占议席的绝对数和比例都已超过了一九四七年片山内阁当时，这次日本社会党的胜利是空前的。
    左右派社会党的胜利是和日本共产党的帮助不可分的。早在选举前的去年十二月七日，日本共产党就提出了竞选纲领，号召一切爱国者团结起来，为和平和独立进行大选斗争。日本共产党的选举工作和政治影响，动员了广大人民，指出了日本国家的前途和当前奋斗的目标；提高了人民斗争的积极性。在大选将近举行前，日本共产党为了避免在同一选区分散和平民主的力量，又自动撤销自己的三十九名候选人，把选票集中给其他左翼党派，帮助他们当选。这是左右派社会党取得胜利的重要因素，这才使得四个民主党派能够取得超过全体议员三分之一的席数。日本共产党对于击败保守党派修改宪法的阴谋，取得这次大选的胜利，是起着决定性的作用的。
    日本大选已经揭晓了，不论由何党何人出来组织新内阁，摆在日本面前有两条道路，一条是吉田走过的依附美国走向战争的道路；另一条是在日本人民身上找到力量，坚决走向独立和和平的道路，新内阁必须在两条道路之中选择一条，如果它走依附美国的道路，必将走向吉田的覆辙；如果它走的是独立和和平的道路，不但可以获得日本人民的拥护，并将受到中国人民以及亚洲人民的欢迎。
