    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th — News from Phnom Penh says that Cambodian King Sihanouk announced his abdication on March 2nd via radio broadcast, ceding the throne to his father, Prince Suramarit. Suramarit has already ascended the throne on the 3rd.

    It can be seen from Sihanouk's abdication statement that his abdication is related to the political attitudes currently adopted by some political parties in Cambodia. Reports say that these parties strongly oppose Sihanouk's recently announced so-called "election reform" plan.

    Sihanouk announced his draft plan on February 19th. According to the election procedures and restrictions on election qualifications stipulated in this plan, all those who have participated in the national liberation movement will lose their right to vote. Sihanouk once said that if his plan were to be realized, "the influence of the various political parties in Cambodia would disappear."

    United Press reporters pointed out that Sihanouk announced his abdication forty-eight hours after U.S. Secretary of State Dulles visited Phnom Penh. He had met with Dulles on February 28th to study the issues of greatly expanding the Cambodian army and providing equipment and money by the United States.

    柬埔寨国王西哈努克退位
    【新华社河内四日电】从金边来的消息说，柬埔寨国王西哈努克在三月二日通过电台广播宣布退位，把王位让给他的父亲苏拉马里特亲王。苏拉马里特已经在三日登位。
    从西哈努克所发表的退位声明中可以看出，他的退位同柬埔寨一些政党目前所采取的政治态度有关。有消息说，这些政党强烈地反对西哈努克最近所宣布的所谓“选举改革”计划。
    西哈努克是在二月十九日宣布他的这个计划草案的。根据这个计划所规定的选举程序和对于选举资格的限制，所有参加过民族解放运动的人都将丧失选举权。西哈努克曾经说过：如果他的计划得以实现，“柬埔寨的各政党就将消失其影响”。
    合众社记者指出，西哈努克宣布退位是在美国国务卿杜勒斯访问金边四十八小时之后。他在二月二十八日和杜勒斯曾经进行会谈，研究了大大扩充柬埔寨军队和由美国提供装备、金钱等问题。
