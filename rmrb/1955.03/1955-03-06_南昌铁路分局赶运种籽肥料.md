The workers of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau, as the busy spring plowing season arrives, are devising methods to quickly transport urgently needed agricultural materials such as rice straw, seeds, and fertilizers to the countryside. When the dispatching office finds vehicle operations are busy, it utilizes methods such as exceeding axle load limits, running faster, and accelerating vehicle turnaround to squeeze out vehicles and promptly transport rice straw to disaster areas. Staff at the Xinyu Station proactively contacted relevant departments to process and bundle the rice straw tightly, enabling each carriage to transport more. Staff at the Nanchang North Station proposed that seeds should be transported as soon as they arrive. When locomotives are burdened with other tasks, they attach seed-laden carriages to passenger trains, ensuring that tons of seeds are continuously transported to various disaster areas along the Nanxun Line. Thanks to the active efforts of all staff, the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau has transported 373 carriages of rice straw and 362 tons of seeds for our farmer brothers from January 20th to the present, providing timely support to farmers in disaster areas for spring plowing.

    南昌铁路分局赶运种籽肥料
    南昌铁路分局的职工们，在紧张的春耕生产季节来到时，设法迅速运输农村急需的稻草、种籽、肥料等物资。调度所在车辆运转繁忙时，用超轴、快跑、加速车辆周转等办法挤出车辆，及时把稻草运送到灾区。新喻站职工主动和有关部门联系，将稻草加工捆紧，使每个车厢能够装运更多。南昌北站职工提出种籽随到随运。当机车负担其他任务时，他们把载种籽的车厢挂在旅客列车上，使成吨种籽源源不断运往南浔线各灾区。在全体职工积极努力下，南昌铁路分局从一月二十日到目前止，已为农民兄弟运送稻草三百七十三车、种籽三百六十二吨等，及时支援了灾区农民进行春耕。（本报记者南昌讯）
