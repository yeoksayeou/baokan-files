Fourteen agricultural machinery stations in Jin County, Raoyang, Sanhe, Cheng'an, Wu'an and other places in Hebei Province have launched a spring ploughing production competition. At present, the stations have cultivated 7,500 mu of land, harrowed 6,000 mu, and rolled over 14,000 mu.

This competition was initiated by the staff of the Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Machinery Station in Jin County before the spring ploughing. The competition aims to plough deeply, well, and quickly, ensuring that the machines do not rest, improving the efficiency of tractors, and reducing fuel consumption. The Xiaoliudian Agricultural Machinery Station in Sanhe County has increased the hourly work efficiency of tractors by 32% and reduced fuel consumption per mu by 15% in the competition. The Gongjiawa Agricultural Machinery Station in Nangong County originally planned to cultivate 85 mu of land per shift (10 hours per shift). After all employees participated in the competition, they now cultivate an average of 90.12 mu per shift, an increase of 42% over the actual cultivation efficiency last year. The Wugong Township Agricultural Machinery Station in Raoyang County completed the ploughing of more than 660 mu of cotton fields in the Geng Changsuo Cooperative in less than two days, and the quality of the ploughing was good, which was praised by the farmers.

This year, the fourteen agricultural machinery stations in Hebei Province plan to cultivate more than 250,000 mu of land for agricultural production cooperatives, more than four times the cultivated area last year. Last year, machine-cultivated land generally increased production by about 10% compared with animal-cultivated land. This year, it is required that the unit area yield be increased by 30% to 40% compared with the bumper year of 1952. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河北省十四个农业机器站展开春耕竞赛
    河北省晋县、饶阳、三河、成安、武安等地的十四个农业机器站展开了春耕生产的竞赛。目前各站已代耕了七千五百亩地，并已耙地六千亩、镇压地一万四千多亩。
    这一竞赛是由晋县周家庄农业机器站职工在春耕前发起的。他们在竞赛中要做到耕得深、耕得好、耕得快，保证歇人不歇机器，提高拖拉机工作效率并降低耗油量等。三河县小柳店农业机器站在竞赛中已使拖拉机每小时的工作效率比竞赛前提高了百分之三十二，每亩耗油量降低了百分之十五。南宫县巩家洼农业机器站，每个班次（十小时一班次）原定耕地八十五亩，全站职工参加竞赛后，现在每个班次平均耕到九十亩零一分二，比去年实际耕地效率提高了百分之四十二。饶阳县五公乡农业机器站，不到两天时间，就把耿长锁社六百六十多亩棉田耕完，耕的质量也好，受到农民称赞。
    河北省十四个农业机器站今年计划给农业生产合作社代耕二十五万多亩土地，比去年扩大代耕面积四倍多。去年机耕地一般较畜耕地增产百分之十左右，今年要求单位面积产量比一九五二年丰收年的产量提高三、四成。　（新华社）
