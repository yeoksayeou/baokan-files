The Soviet experts who are helping our country establish the State-Run Friendship Farm have drawn up a land planning design for the farm in accordance with socialist principles. Through this design, we can see the future of this farm.

All 32,803.58 hectares of the State-Run Friendship Farm have been allocated for various purposes. The Soviet experts of the Land Consolidation Survey Team have not only planned how to correctly utilize this land at present, but also estimated the future development prospects of certain lands. Land with good soil quality and most suitable for growing grain has been designated as eleven large field crop rotation areas. The land in the southern part of the farm, near the Qixing River, has been designated as a paddy field crop rotation area. The total grain planting area of the entire farm is 20,037 hectares. In addition, the land near the livestock farm has been designated as a feed crop rotation area and a pasture grass crop rotation area. A small portion of the swampy land that cannot be cultivated at present has also been designated as a natural hayfield. The area and shape of these natural hayfields are coordinated with the adjacent crop rotation areas, so that they can be incorporated into the adjacent crop rotation areas after soil improvement in the future. Each of the farm's five branch farms has a 10-hectare vegetable garden to produce vegetables to meet the needs of the employees. In addition to a 30-hectare vegetable garden, the farm's general farm also has a 30-hectare orchard, as well as a 200-hectare experimental plot for testing various agricultural techniques and cultivating excellent varieties.

When planning and designing a crop rotation area, the Soviet experts of the Land Consolidation Survey Team considered ensuring the effectiveness of agricultural machinery. There are very few irregular plots in each crop rotation area of the entire farm; most are neat, rectangular, or nearly square plots. This makes it very convenient for machinery to operate horizontally (such as when using advanced cross-seeding or square cluster planting methods), and there will be no reduction in work efficiency due to too many turns. The correct planning of the crop rotation area facilitates the calculation of land area, seed requirements, harvest volume, and workload, so that manpower and material resources can be properly allocated. The entire farm has a total of twenty field crop rotation areas, paddy field crop rotation areas, and feed crop rotation areas (including pasture grass crop rotation areas), which are fixedly managed and produced by thirteen field production teams. Each crop rotation area has an operation station covering an area of ​​one hectare in the center, which can store necessary production materials and is also a place for employees to rest when working in the fields.

In summer, the livestock from the livestock farm are driven to the pasture. Camps are set up on the pasture; when pasture grass is insufficient, grass can be cut from the nearby natural hayfields. In winter, the livestock return to the livestock farm from the pasture. At that time, the feed crops in the livestock farm's affiliated crop rotation area have matured and can be used for livestock to overwinter.

The farm's general farm, branch farms, pastures, and operation stations are all designed with water wells, a total of thirty-two. These water wells are all designed after drilling and investigating the underground water sources and water quality. Maslov, the leader of the Land Consolidation Survey Team, said: Wherever there are people, livestock, and machines, water is needed. The quality of the water directly affects the health of people and livestock and the service life of machines.

The design of the farm's road network is convenient, suitable, and does not waste land. Each branch farm has a road connecting to the highway leading to the Fulitun Railway Station, so as to transport materials in and agricultural products out. Each branch farm and the general farm, other branch farms, each operation area, and the pasture all have roads of varying widths according to different needs. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 国营友谊农场的将来

    国营友谊农场的将来
    帮助我国建立国营友谊农场的苏联专家们，已经按照社会主义原则为国营友谊农场绘制了土地规划的设计图。通过这张设计图，可以看到这个农场的将来。
    国营友谊农场全部三万二千八百零三点五八公顷土地，都被安排了各种用途。土地整理考察组的苏联专家们不但规划了目前如何正确地利用这块土地，而且还估计到某些土地未来可能的发展前途。那些土质良好、最适宜于种植谷物的土地，被划为十一个大田轮作区。农场南部靠近七星河的土地，被划为一个水田轮作区。整个农场的谷物播种面积是两万零三十七公顷。此外，畜牧场附近的土地，被划为饲料轮作区和牧场牧草轮作区。目前不能耕种的一小部分沼泽地也被划为天然割草场。这些天然割草场的面积和形状，都是和临近的轮作区相协调的，以便将来经过改良土壤后并入临近的轮作区。农场的五个分场都有一个占地十公顷的菜园，生产蔬菜来满足职工的需要。农场总场除有一个占地三十公顷的菜园外，还有一个占地三十公顷的果园，以及供试验各种农业技术和培育优良品种的二百公顷试验地。
    土地整理考察组的苏联专家们在规划、设计一块轮作地的时候，就考虑到了保证农业机器效能的发挥。全场各轮作区不规则的地块是很少的，绝大多数是齐整的、长方形的或接近正方形的地块。这就使机器横行作业时（比如在采用先进的交叉播种法或是方形簇种法时）非常方便，不会发生因转头次数太多而降低工作效率的现象。轮作区正确的规划，便于计算土地面积、种籽需要量、收获量和工作量，因而就可以正确地分配人力和物力。全场大田轮作区、水田轮作区、饲料轮作区（包括牧场牧草轮作区）共二十个，分别由十三个田间生产队固定负责管理生产。每个轮作区的中心都设有一个占地一公顷的作业站，里面可以存放生产必需的物资，也是职工们在田间工作时休息的地方。
    夏天，畜牧场的牲畜被赶到放牧场去。放牧场上设有野营；牧草不足时，可以到临近的天然割草场去割草。冬天，牲畜又由放牧场回到畜牧场。那时畜牧场附属轮作区的饲料作物已经成熟，可供牲畜过冬。
    农场总场、分场、放牧场、作业站都设计有水井，共三十二眼。这些水井都是经过钻探，调查地下水源、水质的情况后设计出来的。土地整理考察组组长马斯洛夫说：只要是有人、有牲畜、有机器的地方，就需要水。水质的好坏，直接影响到人、畜的健康和机器使用的寿命。
    农场道路网的设计，做到了既方便、合用，而又不浪费土地。每个分场都有道路连接通往福利屯火车站的公路，以便运进物资和运出农产品。各分场和总场、和其他分场、和每一个作业区、和放牧场都有根据不同需要而宽度各不相同的道路。　（据新华社讯）
