To the Editor:

    One midday in mid-January, at Pier Four in Pukou, several temporary workers appeared. Under the "direction" of a responsible person, they gritted their teeth and painfully dumped dozens of sacks of sesame mixed with soil into the Yangtze River, one bag after another.

    This incident immediately caused a sensation among the stevedores on the pier. “How can this person be so cruel? He doesn't know how to cherish state property at all!” “Oil is so precious! He is wasting it like this. How hateful!” As the workers discussed it, some, not minding the cold, immediately jumped down to the riverbank to salvage the sesame seeds. A Communist Party member and dockworker, Zhou Zhiren, lodged a serious protest with this "responsible person," demanding that he immediately stop this criminal act. Faced with overwhelming public anger, this "responsible person" had no choice but to stop. But sadly, by this time, forty-nine bags of sesame seeds had already been thrown into the Yangtze River.

    It so happened that we were here inspecting work, so we invited this "responsible person" into an office. The following is our conversation with him:

    Question: "What is your name? Which unit are you from?"

    Answer: "Shi Baoyi. Chuxian Oil and Fat Company, Anhui Province."

    We grabbed a handful of the sesame seeds that had not yet been thrown into the river and asked him, "What exactly is going on here?"

    He said, "Ah! This is ‘soil’ sieved from a batch of exported sesame seeds after processing." He emphasized the words "soil," his tone slightly heavier, as if it were not worth making a fuss about.

    We were very surprised at how he dared to be so bold! So we asked again: "What is the opinion of your leadership on this matter?"

    "Of course, it was approved by the leadership. For these ‘soil,’ I returned to the company on January 10th to ask for instructions. Soon, the company sent Comrade Gao from the business section to ‘inspect.’ I said that if this batch of things were to be processed, the processing wages would not be enough; if they were to be transported back, the freight would not be enough, so it would be better to dump them. Comrade Gao agreed with my opinion and took the train back to the company." He recounted the course of events with a clear conscience.

    "Then, how did you calculate the cost and freight?"

    "I estimated that one bag would yield at most five or six jin of sesame seeds."

    We were about to ask him what he based this on when a worker came in and interrupted our conversation. The worker showed us a bag of sesame seeds that had been easily sieved clean, proving that one bag could yield at least fifteen to twenty jin of good sesame seeds. A temporary worker also came over and said, "We asked him to convert these sesame seeds into wages for us, but he refused, preferring to dump them in the river."

    We asked him if he had thought about how much loss this would bring to the country. He shook his head, seemingly not having considered the question.

    The matter is very clear: the leaders of the Chuxian Oil and Fat Company are working with their eyes closed, while Shi Baoyi is wasting the people's property under the "approval" of this bureaucratic attitude!

### 经过“批准”的浪费行为

    经过“批准”的浪费行为编辑同志：
    一月中旬的一天中午，在浦口四号码头上，出现了几个临时工人，他们咬着牙齿忍痛地在一个负责人的“指挥”下，把几十麻袋混土的芝麻，一袋一袋地往长江里倒。
    这件事，顿时轰动了码头上的装卸工人。“这个人心怎么这样狠，他一点也不知道爱惜国家财产！”“油料多珍贵！他却这样浪费，真可恶！”工人们正议论着，有的工人顾不得寒冷马上跳下江边去捞芝麻。一位共产党员码头海员周志仁，他向这位“负责人”提出了严重的抗议，要他立即停止这种犯罪行为。这位“负责人”在众怒难犯之下无可奈何地停止了。但是令人痛心的，这时已经有四十九袋芝麻被抛到长江里去了。
    正好我们在这里检查工作，于是把这位“负责人”邀请到一间办公室里。下面是我们和他的谈话：
    问：“贵姓？那个单位？”
    答：“史宝义。安徽省滁县油脂公司。”
    我们抓起了一把未倒下江的芝麻问他：“这究竟是怎么一回事？”
    他说：“啊！这是一批出口芝麻加工后筛下来的‘泥土’”，特别在说到“泥土”两个字的时候，他的语气略重一些，好像不值得大惊小怪。
    我们很奇怪，他怎么敢这样胆大妄为！于是再问：“你们领导上对这事的意见怎样？”
    “那当然是领导批准的。为了这些‘泥土’，我在一月十日曾回公司请示，不久公司派了一个业务股的高同志来‘检查’。我说，这批东西，假如要加工不够加工工资，装回去又不够运费，不如倒掉算了。高同志同意了我的意见，就坐火车回公司去了。”他理直气壮地讲述了事情的经过。
    “那么，你是怎样计算成本和运费的呢？”
    “估计一袋顶多筛到五、六斤芝麻出来。”
    我们正要问他是根据什么，进来一位工人打断了我们的谈话。工人拿了一包没花多大气力就筛干净的芝麻给我们看，他证明一袋最少可以筛到好芝麻十五到二十斤。一位临时工也走来说：“我们要他把这芝麻折算工资给我们，他不肯，却宁愿倒在江里。”
    我们问他有没有想到这样做给国家带来多少损失，他摇摇头，似乎没有考虑过这个问题。
    事情十分明显了：滁县油脂公司的领导人在闭着眼睛工作，而史宝义却在这种官僚主义的“批准”下浪费着人民的财产！
