In the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
    Widespread Use of Atomic Energy to Improve Production
    Academic Secretary of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Academician Topchiev, recently gave an interview to a TASS reporter, talking about the increasing use of atomic energy in the Soviet Union for scientific research and improving industrial and agricultural production.
    Topchiev said that the Institute of Metallurgy, the Institute of Automation and Remote Control, and the Institute of Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences are all using tracer atom methods for research. Recently, scientists have designed many instruments that use nuclear radiation, such as "soil meters" and "thickness gauges." These instruments are very accurate and can be used to measure the concentration of mud, adjust the thickness of metal strips, paper strips, and rubber strips, and check the density of coatings on various materials. In addition to being fast and accurate, these instruments have another advantage: they visually inspect objects from the outside, so there is no need to put any tools inside the object being inspected or damage its shell. There is also no need to stop the operation process when using this method. In this regard, atomic energy is even better than magnetic and X-ray inspection methods.
    Topchiev said that due to the use of tracer atom methods, new developments have emerged in some important aspects of plant physiology research. Tracer atom "indicators" can be used to discover the speed at which organic matter travels from the leaves to the roots, which no one knew until now. Other experiments have also yielded some interesting new findings. For example, the process of sugar formation in beets does not occur in the roots as previously thought, but in the leaves. Nicotine in tobacco is first formed in the roots and then transferred from the roots to the leaves. This research is of great significance for plant selection and cultivation.
    Soviet scientists conducted experiments using tracer superphosphate to study the most suitable method and timing for applying phosphate fertilizer to crops. They found that in the early stages of plant growth, the need for phosphorus is less when using superphosphate and humus blocks than when using superphosphate alone. In the later stages of growth, plants absorb phosphorus best from organic-inorganic mixed fertilizers.
    Topchiev said that in medicine, especially in the diagnosis of illnesses, radioactive elements have been successfully used. Adding a small amount of tracer atoms to the medicine makes it possible to observe the speed at which the body absorbs the medicine and the moment when the medicine penetrates the diseased organ.
    Many Factories Complete Five-Year Plans Ahead of Schedule
    Since the beginning of this year, many factories in the Soviet Union have completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) ahead of schedule.
    The Panomarenko Mining Machinery Factory in Voroshilovgrad Oblast was the first in the entire oblast to complete the total output task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.
    The Stalinabad Electric Motor Factory in Tajikistan completed the Five-Year Plan as early as late February. Compared with 1951, the factory's output of equipment for rural power stations increased by 50 percent.
    The Yerevan Porcelain Factory in Armenia also completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The factory's main product—construction porcelain—increased fivefold compared to 1950.
    The Lviv Metal Processing Factory was the first in Lviv, Ukrainian Republic industry, to complete the Five-Year Plan. During the Five-Year Plan period, this factory accumulated more than 2 million rubles beyond the plan by increasing output and reducing costs.
    Resettlement to Siberia and the Far East
    According to the Soviet "Agricultural Newspaper," working people from all over the Soviet Union are continuously resettling to the Siberian and Far Eastern regions of the Soviet Union to develop and utilize the abundant land resources there. In 1954 alone, more than 7,670 families resettled to the Altai and Krasnoyarsk Territories, Tyumen Oblast, and Irkutsk Oblast.
    When the working people of the Soviet Union resettle to Siberia and the Far East, they receive great help from the state and local collective farms and state farms. The state provides for all their travel expenses and the freight charges for their personal belongings. The state and local collective farms and state farms also provide immigrants with subsidies and long-term loans, and supply them with building materials for constructing private residences.
    Research on Treating Myopia with Tissue Therapy
    The Ukrainian Experimental Institute of Ophthalmology, led by Academician Filatov, is studying the pathology of myopia and new methods for treating this disease.
    Academician Filatov told a TASS reporter that the basis of our method for treating myopia is tissue therapy. We use a liniment made from refrigerated tissue on patients, either by subcutaneous injection or orally. At the same time, patients must adhere to a strict hygiene regime. As has been proven in hundreds of cases, tissue therapy can have a very good effect if the disease has not developed too severely. We not only administer this therapy when pathological changes can already be observed on the retina and choroid, but also when pathological changes cannot yet be seen, but the patient's vision has indeed been impaired. The new materials we have obtained indicate that tissue therapy can have a good therapeutic effect on the sclera, and the elongation of the sclera is the main cause of myopia.
    The institute has a special clinic attached to it, which conducts systematic examinations of school-age children and patients with myopia.
    A Twenty-Two-Story Building Completed in Moscow
    A newly built twenty-two-story building on Uprising Square in Moscow has been fully completed and has begun to receive its residents. In front of the building, cars are constantly bringing in various furniture. Families who have already moved into the new home include the President of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Bakulev, the disabled veteran of the Patriotic War, Vokhinin, the Heroic Mother, Barashova, and the teacher, Alexandrova.
    This newly completed building has a total of 452 well-equipped rooms, each with two to four rooms, with a total room area of 18,000 square meters. A street garden has been opened in the open space in front of the building.
    It is very convenient for people living here to watch movies and buy food. On the first floor of the building, there is a cinema and the largest food store in the country, the "Koufou" store.
    Prefabricated Houses for Residential Use for Sale
    The consumer cooperative stores in various districts of Bryansk Oblast, Soviet Union, have a type of advertisement this year that has not been seen before. The advertisement says that the store has received a batch of prefabricated houses, ready for sale. These prefabricated houses are for ordinary working people to use as residences. Each house has three rooms, and the structure is up to standard and very easy to install. In addition, customers can also buy heating pipes and kitchen stoves at the same time and install them in their new homes.
    These houses are manufactured by the Altukhov and Jatiakov Standard House Manufacturing Plant.
    Using Plastic Printing Type to Replace Lead Type
    A group of Soviet scientists and printing workers has designed a printing type made of thermoplastic material.
    This new type is far superior to the commonly used lead type in terms of adapting to modern printing needs. For example, ordinary lead type is easily worn during the printing and paper-making process. Tests have shown that the wear resistance of plastic type is twice that of lead type, and in paper-making, the wear resistance of plastic type exceeds that of lead type by dozens of times. According to the experience of printing workers, plastic type is very stable on the printing press and also has good ink absorption properties. At the same time, replacing lead type with plastic type can save expensive and scarce non-ferrous metals. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of manufacturing plastic type is 50 to 60 percent lower than that of lead type. In particular, the use of plastic type can avoid the disadvantage of lead type being harmful to workers' health.

    在苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟
    广泛地利用原子能改进生产
    苏联科学院学术秘书长托普切夫院士最近对塔斯社记者发表谈话，讲到苏联日益广泛地利用原子能进行科学研究工作和改进工农业生产的情况。
    托普切夫说，苏联科学院冶金研究所、自动化和远距离操纵研究所以及化学研究所都在采用示踪原子法进行研究工作。最近，科学家们设计了许多利用核子放射的仪器，如“泥土测量器”、“厚度测量器”等。这些仪器的精确度是很高的，可以用来测量泥浆的浓度，调整金属条、纸条和橡皮条的厚度，检查各种材料的涂料的密度。这些仪器除了快和精确以外，还有一个优点，就是：它是从外部透视物体的，因此不必用任何工具放到被检查的东西的内部去，不必破坏它的外壳。使用这种方法时也不必停止操作过程。在这方面，原子能甚至比磁石法和爱克斯光检查法要好。
    托普切夫说，由于使用示踪原子法，在植物生理学研究的一些重要方面已经出现了新的情况。用示踪原子“指示器”可以发现直到现在没有人知道的有机物质从叶部运行到根部的速度。另外一些试验也获得了一些新的有趣的发现。例如，甜菜中糖分形成的过程，不是像以前所想像的那样是在根部发生，而是在叶部发生的。烟草中的尼古丁先在根部形成，然后再从根部移到叶部去。这种研究对植物的选种和培育有很大的意义。
    苏联科学家进行了用示踪过磷酸钙来研究农作物施加磷肥最合适的方法和时期的试验。他们发现：在植物生长的初期，使用过磷酸钙和腐植质泥块时，磷的需要量要比单用过磷酸钙时要少。到生长的后期，植物从有机—无机混合肥料中吸收磷的情况最好。
    托普切夫说，在医学中，特别是在诊断病况的时候，已经成功地采用放射性元素。药剂中加入少量的示踪原子，就有可能观察机体吸收药剂的速度和药剂渗入患病器官的时刻。
    许多工厂提前完成五年计划
    今年年初以来苏联已经有许多工厂提前完成了第五个五年（一九五一—一九五五年）计划。
    伏罗希洛夫格勒州的帕诺勉科采矿机器工厂在全州最先完成了五年计划规定的总产量任务。
    塔吉克的斯大林纳巴德电机工厂早在二月下旬就完成了五年计划。和一九五一年相比，工厂为农村电力站生产的装备的产量增加了百分之五十。
    亚美尼亚的埃里温瓷器工厂也提前完成了五年计划。工厂的主要产品——建筑用瓷的产量比一九五零年增加了五倍。
    乌克兰共和国里沃夫城工业中最先完成五年计划的是里沃夫金属加工工厂。在五年计划期中，这个工厂由于增加产量和降低成本，共超计划积累了两百多万卢布。
    向西伯利亚和远东地区移居
    据苏联“农业报”报道：苏联各地劳动人民不断移居到苏联西伯利亚和远东地区，去开发和利用那里丰富的土地资源。一九五四年，单是移居到阿尔泰和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区、邱门州和伊尔库次克州的就有七千六百七十多家。
    苏联劳动人民向西伯利亚和远东地区移居时，都得到国家和当地集体农庄和国营农场的大力帮助。他们移居的路费和私人财物的运费全由国家供给。国家和当地集体农庄及国营农场还给予移民补助金和长期贷款，供应他们建设私人住宅的建筑材料。
    研究用组织疗法治疗近视眼
    由费拉托夫院士领导的乌克兰实验眼科研究所，正在研究近视眼的病理和治疗这种疾病的新方法。
    费拉托夫院士告塔斯社记者说，我们治疗近视眼的方法的基础就是组织疗法。我们对病人使用一种由冷藏组织制成的浸膏，或是皮下注射或是内服。同时，病人必须遵守严格的卫生制度。正如已经为千百个病例所证明了的，如果疾病还没有发展得太严重，组织疗法就能有很好的效果。我们不仅在从视网膜和眼脉络膜上已经可以观察出病理变化时施行这种疗法，而且在还不能看出病理变化然而病人的视力确已受到损害的时候就施行这种疗法。我们已获得的新材料表明，组织疗法对巩膜能有良好的治疗效果，而巩膜的延长就是造成近视眼的主要原因。
    研究所特别附设了一个诊疗所，对学龄儿童和近视眼患者进行系统的检查。
    莫斯科建成二十二层的大楼
    莫斯科起义广场上新建的一座二十二层的大楼，已经全部落成，并且开始接纳主人。在大楼的门前，不断有汽车运来各种家具。现在已经搬入新居的有苏联医学科学院院长巴库列夫、卫国战争中的残废军人沃希宁、母亲英雄巴拉萧娃、教师亚历山德罗娃等人的家庭。
    这座新落成的大楼共有四百五十二套设备完善的房间，每套房间有两间到四间房，房间的总面积有一万八千平方公尺。大楼前面的空地上已经开辟了街心花园。
    住在这里的人想看电影和买食品都很方便。大楼的第一层就有电影院和全国最大的食品商店——“口福”商店。
    出售作住宅用的预装配房屋
    苏联布利安斯克州各区的消费合作社商店，今年出现了一种过去没有见到过的广告。广告上说，商店已经运到了一批预装配房屋，准备出售。这种预装配房屋是供普通劳动人民作住宅用的，每座房屋有三个房间，结构合乎标准，安装非常方便。此外，顾客还可以同时买到暖气管和厨房用的锅灶等，安装到自己的新居里。
    这种房屋是阿尔图霍夫和吉阿蒂科夫标准房屋制造厂制造的。
    用塑料造印刷活字代替铅字
    苏联一批科学家和印刷工人设计了一种用热塑胶材料制造的印刷活字。
    这种新活字在适应现代印刷需要方面，大大优于通常使用的铅字。例如普通铅字在印刷和打纸型过程中，很容易磨损。而试验表明，塑胶活字的耐磨性比铅字高一倍，而在打纸型时，塑胶活字的耐磨性更超过铅字几十倍。根据印刷工人经验，塑胶活字在印刷机上很稳固，吸着印墨的性能也很好。同时以塑胶活字代替铅字，可以节省昂贵的、稀少的有色金属。根据初步估计，制造塑胶活字的成本，比铅字低百分之五十到六十。特别是利用塑胶活字后，可以避免使用铅字有碍工人健康的缺点。
