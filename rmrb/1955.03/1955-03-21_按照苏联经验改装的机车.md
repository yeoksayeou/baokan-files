　　Locomotive Modified According to Soviet Experience
    A locomotive modified by the Shanghai Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Administration, according to the Soviet locomotives exhibited at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, ran 10,000 kilometers in sixteen days, and its operating condition was very good.
    When assembling the Soviet locomotives from the exhibition, the workers at the locomotive depot discovered two prominent differences between Soviet and Chinese locomotives: one was that Soviet locomotives, except for a few places, did not use non-ferrous metal parts; the other was that the design of the Soviet locomotive cylinder expansion ring was different from that of China. They consulted Soviet locomotive experts who came to Shanghai with the exhibition about these issues. The experts came to the locomotive depot and inspected a locomotive being repaired, pointing out more than twenty kinds of copper parts that could be replaced with iron and cast steel; they also introduced in detail the advantages of the Soviet locomotive cylinder expansion ring, explaining that it was airtight and would not leak, and one expansion ring could be used for 60,000 kilometers.
    The technicians and workers of the locomotive depot immediately studied the Soviet experts' suggestions. Within seven days, they replaced more than twenty kinds of copper parts on the locomotive with iron parts. The copper material replaced from one locomotive totaled 387 kilograms, of which the two large rocker arm copper sleeves alone weighed more than 90 kilograms of copper. They also modified the steam chamber cylinder expansion ring according to the Soviet style. As a result, the slow and coal-consuming phenomenon that used to occur with this locomotive no longer exists. Originally, the expansion ring had to be replaced every 2,500 kilometers, but this time it ran 10,000 kilometers and the expansion ring was still in good condition. In the past twenty days, this locomotive has saved a total of ten tons of coal. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　按照苏联经验改装的机车
    上海铁路管理局上海机务段按照苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上的苏联机车而改装的一台机车，十六天内跑满一万公里，行车情况非常良好。
    机务段工人们在装配展览会上的苏联机车时，发现苏联机车与中国机车有两个突出的不同点：一个是苏联机车上除了个别地方，都不用有色金属的配件；另一个是苏联机车汽缸涨圈的设计式样和中国的不同。他们把这些问题请教了随展览会来上海的苏联机车专家。专家来到机务段检查了一台正在修理的机车，向大家指出了二十多种可以用铁和铸钢代替的铜配件；又向大家详细介绍了苏联机车汽缸涨圈的优点，说明它严密不会漏气，一只涨圈可以用来行驶六万公里。
    机务段的技术人员和工人立刻研究了苏联专家的建议，七天之内，他们把机车上二十多种铜配件都换上了铁的。一台机车换下的铜料共有三百八十七公斤，其中两支大的摇杆铜套就有九十多公斤铜。他们也按照苏联式样改装了汽室汽缸涨圈。结果，这台机车过去经常走得又慢又费煤的现象现在都没有了。原来行驶二千五百公里就要换一次涨圈，这次行驶了一万公里涨圈还很好。近二十天来，这台机车共节省煤十吨。　（新华社）
