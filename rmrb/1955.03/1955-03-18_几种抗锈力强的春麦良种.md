Several High Rust-Resistant Spring Wheat Varieties

Shen Yuqing

In recent years, China has cultivated several excellent high-yielding spring wheat varieties resistant to rust. These varieties are: Cooperation No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and Gansu No. 96. Promoting these excellent wheat varieties in spring wheat planting areas is of great significance for increasing wheat production.

Since 1952, these excellent spring wheat varieties have been demonstrated and propagated on a large scale in state-owned mechanized farms, county farms, and some agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms in Northeast China.

The common characteristics of these varieties are strong resistance to stem rust and high and stable yields. Gansu No. 96 spring wheat is generally not infected or has very mild stem rust infection. Cooperation No. 1 to No. 4 spring wheat also have stronger rust resistance than local varieties. Therefore, these varieties can increase production by 30% to 50% compared to ordinary varieties in normal years; in years when rust disease is prevalent, they can increase production by more than 100% compared to ordinary varieties. In 1954, Heilongjiang Province propagated these improved spring wheat varieties on 4,841 hectares, with an average yield of over 3,200 jin per hectare, more than doubling the yield of general spring wheat in the province. Stem rust is a major threat to spring wheat. In Northeast China in 1948, the average spring wheat rust disease rate reached 75%, and the entire region's spring wheat production was reduced by 560,000 tons. In 1953, when Northeast China expected a bumper spring wheat harvest, it was suddenly hit by rust disease, resulting in a poor harvest; that year, Heilongjiang Province only harvested 71 jin of spring wheat per mu, a decrease of 30.2 jin compared to 1952. After the successful cultivation of high-yielding, rust-resistant wheat varieties, the yield per unit area of wheat can be increased and stabilized.

The excellent qualities of these varieties are significant. In 1954, the agricultural departments of Northeast China, with the assistance of agricultural scientific institutions, studied and determined the suitable areas for these varieties, and have planned to propagate 20 million jin of improved varieties. In 1955, the Northeast region can expand the propagation area by more than 60,000 hectares, and it is expected that these varieties can be basically planted throughout the region by 1957. The suitable areas for these varieties may continue to expand, and other spring wheat planting areas can also widely test them. (Attached picture)

This is a comparison of improved spring wheat varieties and local spring wheat varieties after the occurrence of rust disease in Heilongjiang Province in 1954: From left to right: the first and second are local varieties, the third is Gansu No. 96, and the fourth is Cooperation No. 2.

    几种抗锈力强的春麦良种
    沈煜清
    几年来我国已培育出几种抗锈、高产的春小麦优良品种。这些品种是：合作一号、二号、三号、四号和甘肃九十六号。在春小麦种植区推广这些优良小麦品种，对于增加小麦产量具有重要意义。
    从一九五二年开始，这些优良春小麦品种都在东北地区的各国营机械农场、各县农场、部分农业生产合作社和集体农庄，进行了大面积的生产示范和繁殖。
    这些品种的共同特点是抵抗秆锈病力强，产量高而稳定。甘肃九十六号春小麦对秆锈病一般不感染或感染极轻。合作一——四号春小麦也比当地品种有较强的耐锈能力。因此，这些品种在一般年份能比普通品种增产百分之三十到五十；在锈病流行的年份，能比普通品种增产一倍以上。黑龙江省一九五四年繁殖这些良种春小麦四千八百四十一公顷，每公顷平均产量在三千二百斤以上，比全省一般春小麦增产一倍。秆锈病对春小麦威胁很大。东北地区一九四八年春小麦锈病受病率一般达百分之七十五，全区春小麦减产五十六万吨。一九五三年东北春小麦丰收在望时，忽然遭受锈病，结果竟歉收了；这一年黑龙江省每亩只收春小麦七十一斤，比一九五二年减产三十点二斤。抗锈高产的小麦良种培育成功后，就能使小麦的单位面积产量提高和稳定。
    这些品种的优良品质是显著的。一九五四年东北农业部门已在农业科学机关的协助下，研究确定了这几个品种的适应地区，并且已有计划地繁殖了二千万斤良种。一九五五年东北地区可扩大繁殖面积六万多公顷，预计到一九五七年就可基本上在全区种植。这些品种的适应地区还有可能不断扩大，其他春麦种植区也可以广泛地试种。（附图片）
