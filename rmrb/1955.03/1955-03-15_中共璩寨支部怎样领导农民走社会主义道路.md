Editor's Note: The CPC Quzhai Branch in Luan County, Shanxi Province, was formally established in 1947. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the work of this branch has consistently been successful. In 1953, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee decided to promote the work experience of the Quzhai Branch throughout Shanxi Province. This article systematically describes the entire process of how the Quzhai Branch led peasants to organize agricultural production mutual aid teams, and then to organize agricultural producers' cooperatives. At present, in the agricultural collectivization movement, how to strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural producers' cooperatives is of particular importance, and the work experience of the Quzhai Branch can be used as a reference for various localities.

How the CPC Quzhai Branch Leads Peasants to Take the Socialist Road
Wang Gengxi

From Mutual Aid Teams to Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives

As early as the spring of 1946, the peasants of Quzhai Village, Luan County, Shanxi Province, responded to the call of the Party and the government and began to embark on the road of "getting organized." After several years of development, by 1951, more than 90 percent of the total number of peasant households in the village had been organized, and the peasants participating in the mutual aid teams had generally increased production.

After the autumn of 1951, Luan County held a county-wide labor model conference. Gou Peifang, Gou Faxing, and Che Chunlan, Communist Party members of the Quzhai Village Branch, Hou Yezhe, a member of the Communist Youth League, and Jia Xinggui, an activist, attended the conference as labor models. At the county labor model conference, the experience of Nantianhe Village in running agricultural producers' cooperatives on a trial basis was introduced. The attendees were immediately attracted to this new thing. Gou Peifang, Gou Faxing, Che Chunlan, Hou Yezhe, and Jia Xinggui felt that in order to improve agricultural production, cooperatives had to be established. They took advantage of the breaks in the meeting to discuss the benefits of establishing cooperatives with the labor models from Nantianhe. After the meeting, Gou Faxing, Che Chunlan, and Jia Xinggui personally visited the Nantianhe Agricultural Producers' Cooperative to learn about the methods of running a cooperative.

Under the influence of the Nantianhe Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, the Quzhai Branch Committee formally began to study the issue of establishing cooperatives. Initially, some members of the branch committee did not fully understand the significance of establishing cooperatives. Some people said, "Mutual aid teams have also increased production, so why bother establishing cooperatives?" In order to unify the leadership's thinking, the branch committee launched a discussion on the question of "why establish cooperatives." Zhao Fengze, a member of the branch committee, said, "Mutual aid teams plant whatever they have, and cannot plant crops according to the soil quality. If we establish agricultural producers' cooperatives, we can plant crops according to the quality of the soil, which will increase grain production." Gou Faxing cited an unpleasant incident that occurred in the mutual aid team in the summer of 1951, saying, "Once, just after a heavy rain, it was the right time to weed the seedlings. Group member Guo Shuihe asked the group to weed his land first, and Jia Panghai asked to weed his land first. Other group members also wanted to work on their own land first. They argued for a long time, and could not reach an agreement, so the group disbanded. As a result of the disbandment, more than 60 mu of grain was left uncultivated." This kind of discussion, combined with the actual situation in the village, quickly unified the leadership's thinking. The branch committee unanimously agreed that the mutual aid teams were no longer able to adapt to the future development of production, and the Party should lead the peasants to establish agricultural producers' cooperatives. Then, the branch committee specifically studied the conditions for establishing a cooperative. Gou Faxing's mutual aid team had a large number of Party members, strong backbone, and a good foundation for mutual aid. The branch committee decided to establish a cooperative based on the mutual aid team led by Gou Faxing.

As soon as the news of establishing a cooperative spread, the masses' thinking immediately became confused. Old man Jia Rengui said, "Establishing a cooperative is like 'returning to the big pile.' In the future, we won't be able to eat and drink on our own." Fearing that "returning to the big pile" would include his mule, Qu Mancai quietly sold it. The branch organized propagandists to be responsible for specific households to publicize the benefits of establishing a cooperative, explaining that establishing a cooperative was not "returning to the big pile," and those who had visited the Nantianhe Agricultural Producers' Cooperative explained it to everyone.

After careful publicity and mobilization, among the 16 households in the Gou Faxing mutual aid team who decided to switch to a cooperative, there were still five households who could not make up their minds. Old middle peasant Jia Panghai found it convenient to engage in sideline production in the mutual aid team, and was afraid that he would not be able to do so freely after joining the cooperative, but he was unwilling to leave the mutual aid team if he did not join the cooperative. Some were worried that it would be inconvenient to eat melons and vegetables after joining the cooperative, and others had weak labor power and were afraid that they would receive less grain after joining the cooperative. In order to further dispel the masses' ideological concerns, the branch invited Wang Chouhai, the deputy director of the Nantianhe Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, to carefully explain various issues in running the cooperative to everyone, which finally resolved everyone's ideological knots. In addition to the 16 households in the Gou Faxing mutual aid team, Xu Wenjing and three other peasant households volunteered to join the cooperative this time.

The First Year of Running a Cooperative

After the agricultural producers' cooperative was established, how to lead everyone to the road of prosperity? At that time, the branch was not very clear about this. There was a speculative merchant in the village named Zhang Desheng, who had engaged in speculative business for three or four years and made a huge profit of more than 15 million yuan (old currency), and often promoted in the village: "Raising a family by farming, making a fortune by doing business." Some cooperative members, seeing that Zhang Desheng had made a lot of money by doing business, became envious and suggested to the cooperative cadres: "Let's also send some people to do business. Look how much money people make by doing business. When will we ever get rich just by relying on these few mu of land?" The cooperative cadres accepted the opinions of these cooperative members, raised 12 million yuan, and sent Zhang Youfa and four other cooperative members to southern Shanxi to sell iron goods.

At this time, the CPC Luan County Committee was holding a meeting to criticize the capitalist tendencies of a few agricultural producers' cooperatives in operating businesses. Gou Faxing, the director of the Quzhai Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, attended this meeting and was greatly surprised. After returning to the village, Gou Faxing was determined to implement the spirit of the county committee meeting and reverse the capitalist business thinking in the cooperative. The branch committee seriously discussed the instructions of the county committee and decided to first carry out a struggle against capitalist business thinking within the Party, so that Party members could recognize the harm of developing capitalism to the Party's cause. In the ideological self-criticism, cooperative director Gou Faxing said, "I was influenced by capitalist thinking and almost ruined the cooperative." He promised to immediately write a letter to the cooperative members engaged in business outside, asking them to return quickly. However, some cooperative members were still reluctant to give up the "benefits" of doing business. Jia Panghai's wife said, "We can't stop the business. What's the use of relying on these few mu of land?" At this time, the people doing business outside happened to return. The cooperative members all estimated that they had made a lot of money this time. Unexpectedly, the four people doing business had wasted more than two months of work and not only did not make money, but also lost money. The branch immediately seized this fact to educate the cooperative members, explaining that this path was impassable. After these education efforts, the idea of "doing business" among the cooperative members was clarified. Subsequently, after democratic discussion among the cooperative members, the funds for doing business were used to buy 4,000 jin of soybean cake and 300 jin of fertilizer, which were put into production.

The confusion in the business thinking of the agricultural producers' cooperative affected the normal progress of the cooperative's production order. After clarifying the capitalist business thinking, the branch began to rectify production. At that time, the spring plowing production in the cooperative was in a state of serious chaos. Every day when it was time to go to the fields, the cooperative members would come to the cooperative director to ask for work. Sometimes, even at mealtime, the cooperative members could not go to the fields. Many cooperative members worked hard in their private plots, but "dragged their feet" when working for the cooperative. The mutual aid teams in the village had already finished planting their land, but the cooperative members of the agricultural producers' cooperative were still planting corn in the fields. Some people sarcastically said, "People in the cooperative are particular, they plant late and harvest more." When the cooperative members heard this, they became even more discouraged. Some said, "Joining the cooperative is unlucky. The business didn't work out, and agriculture is also mediocre." Some secretly planned: "It's better to withdraw from the cooperative earlier and take care of myself, so as not to suffer with the cooperative." The cooperative cadres were worried about this situation.

After the end of spring plowing production this year, the branch committee decided to try the method of small-scale contracting in the cooperative to reverse the chaotic situation in production. This method divided the cultivated area according to the labor groups, evaluated the work for each cultivated area, and contracted it to the groups. Long-term workers were not dismissed, and short-term workers were not compensated. After the implementation of this method, the phenomenon of "dragging feet" in work was reduced, but the phenomenon of sloppy work and disregard for quality still existed. Party member Jia Shengze was very careless in his work. Some cooperative members saw this and said: "Even Party members do that, so what are we afraid of!" These situations aroused the dissatisfaction of the labor-active cooperative members, who complained to the cooperative affairs cadres: "If the cooperative does not overcome the problem of sloppy work, production will definitely decrease in the fall." The Party branch studied this situation and first criticized Jia Shengze's work attitude within the Party. Jia Shengze accepted the criticism from the branch and made a public self-criticism in front of the cooperative members. Then, the branch, together with the cooperative affairs committee, organized an inspection team to go to the fields to inspect the field production situation, praised those who did well, gave appropriate criticism to those who did sloppy work, and stipulated that those who did particularly well should be given more work points, and those whose work did not meet the quality standards should have work points deducted, so that the chaotic phenomenon in production was gradually overcome.

After rectification, a new atmosphere emerged in the agricultural producers' cooperative. All kinds of work in the cooperative were done ahead of the mutual aid teams.

After the autumn harvest, the Party branch led all the peasants in the village in production appraisal and summary; the average yield per mu of the agricultural producers' cooperative was 27.2 dou, which was 10.3 dou more per mu than before the establishment of the cooperative, 6.7 dou more per mu than the best mutual aid team in the village, and 15 dou more per mu than the individual peasants. Of the 19 cooperative members, 17 received more grain than in previous years. The agricultural producers' cooperative used facts to show the masses its superiority. People reflected: "Joining the agricultural producers' cooperative was the right path. Those who did not join the cooperative this time also figured out the bottom line of the agricultural producers' cooperative; there is nothing wrong with taking the road of collectivization."

Walking Step by Step

The agricultural producers' cooperative was successfully run in the first year. Many peasants saw that the agricultural producers' cooperative could indeed increase production, and they signed up to join the cooperative one after another. Some Party members only saw the positive side of the peasants' active request to join the cooperative, and did not seriously analyze the complex ideological situation of the peasants in the process of joining the cooperative, thus generating the idea of "running a large cooperative." Branch committee member Yang Yingtang said, "We should absorb those who are willing to join the cooperative. The bigger the cooperative, the better. Anyway, everyone will take this path in the future." Under the support of this mentality, the agricultural producers' cooperative expanded to 127 households in the spring of 1953. Some people who had not really cleared their minds also joined the cooperative along with the trend.

As the cooperative expanded, some people advocated pricing the livestock and farm implements and turning them over to the cooperative. Branch committee member Zhang Huaibao said, "The more public property the agricultural producers' cooperative has, the more secure the cooperative members will feel in the cooperative. Let's just turn all the livestock and farm implements over to the public." As a result, the 12 livestock of the cooperative members were priced and turned over to the cooperative.

After the livestock was priced and turned over to the cooperative, the cooperative's debt increased. The average debt per household was about 500,000 yuan. Some new cooperative members who had just joined the cooperative were very worried when they saw such a large debt, saying, "We have taken on so much debt as soon as we joined the cooperative. I don't know how much we can get after a year of hard work." The households that had turned over their livestock to the cooperative were also very unhappy, feeling that they did not know when they would get the money after the livestock was turned over to the cooperative. Qu Huaibao used to work very hard in the cooperative, but since he turned over his livestock to the cooperative, he has also become discouraged and said to his wife: "Looking at this situation, everything will gradually be turned over to the public in the future. It doesn't matter whether we work hard or not, we are working for others." After the livestock was concentrated for feeding, it also brought many difficulties. The biggest difficulty was that the problem of forage was not easy to solve. The original livestock-raising households were unwilling to invest, and the non-livestock-raising households could not afford to invest. Sometimes, when there was really no way, the cooperative cadres had to pay for it themselves. As a result, some households that were not firm in joining the cooperative began to waver. The thinking of the masses outside the cooperative was also very confused. Shen Tianxing and seven other peasant households quickly sold their livestock. After the beginning of spring, some peasants did not repair their land or send manure, saying, "Maybe we will have to join the cooperative sooner or later. Isn't it just for the cooperative if we do it now?"

In the spring of 1953, when the masses' thinking was confused, the Party Central Committee issued the "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and the "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production to Party Committees at All Levels," and the People's Daily published the editorial "Where is the Key to Leading Agricultural Production," and the county committee instructed all villages to study these documents and combine them with correcting the rash and hasty tendencies in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. When the Quzhai Branch implemented the instructions of the county committee, the Party members had great resistance; some people believed that running large cooperatives and implementing the pricing of livestock to join the cooperative were all for "socialism" and could not be said to be deviations; others believed that correcting deviations was not glorious, and some said: "There will always be ideological problems among the masses. Just educate them in the future." The branch's leadership thinking also showed hesitation and wavering on this issue.

In order to correct the blind and rash tendencies and implement the instructions of the Central Committee, the CPC Luan County Committee convened a three-level cadre meeting of the county, district, and village. Gou Peifang, the secretary of the Quzhai Branch, and Qu Guoyuan, the village head, attended the three-level cadre meeting convened by the county committee. After the education of the meeting, Gou Peifang and Qu Guoyuan realized the importance of correcting deviations. After returning to the village, they led all Party members to launch a serious discussion. After discussion, the understanding was unified. Everyone believed that it was necessary to proceed from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy. The previous approach was "the old eagle grabs the donkey, without looking at the object," wanting to take a step to socialism. This not only did not do the work well, but also caused many ideological concerns among the masses. After the Party's thinking was clarified, propaganda was carried out to the masses. The cooperative affairs committee accepted the proposal of the branch and returned the twelve livestock that the cooperative members had priced and turned over to the cooperative to the cooperative members for individual feeding. Twenty-five peasants who were unwilling to stay in the cooperative automatically withdrew from the cooperative.

After correcting the deviations, the agricultural producers' cooperative was consolidated and the thinking of the masses was stabilized.

In the winter of this year, the Party put forward the general line for the transition period. After the peasants were educated by the general line, they actively requested to join the agricultural producers' cooperative and take the socialist road. More than 140 peasants in the village requested to join the cooperative.

A large number of peasants requested to join the agricultural producers' cooperative, but some leading cadres of the cooperative did not fully understand the new level of awareness of the masses under the new situation; coupled with the influence of correcting the rash advance deviations in the spring of 1953, they did not dare to accept peasants with awareness and eager to join the cooperative. Cooperative affairs committee member Hou Yezhe said, "After correcting the deviations, our cooperative has been consolidated. If we expand again, there will be problems." In response to this situation, the branch committee first held a meeting to study it. At the meeting, branch secretary Gou Peifang said, "After the propaganda of the general line, the socialist awareness of the masses has been raised, and they are actively requesting to join the agricultural producers' cooperative. This is fundamentally different from the situation in which peasants were forcibly pulled in in those days. Our cooperative should expand according to the actual situation to meet the requirements of the masses." He proposed that the agricultural producers' cooperative should be expanded to more than 200 households. Branch committee members Lu Jisuo and Cheng Sixiao agreed with Gou Peifang's opinion. Cheng Sixiao said, "The propaganda of the general line is to ask everyone to take the socialist road. Is the cooperative closing the door and telling everyone to go that way?" However, these opinions were immediately opposed by branch committee member Zhang Huaibao, who said, "We just opposed the rash advance in the spring, and now we are going to expand the cooperative again. Isn't this going back and forth?" Branch secretary Gou Peifang proposed the question of whether expanding the cooperative should be considered a rash advance based on the opinions of both sides, and asked everyone to discuss it. Everyone expressed their opinions. Lu Jisuo said, "The mistake of blindly advancing in the spring of this year was because the branch had a hasty mentality and did not proceed from the actual situation at that time. Now the situation is different from the spring of this year. After the propaganda of the general line, the masses have seen the benefits of taking the socialist road. Moreover, the branch has more experience in leading the cooperative. In this case, expanding the agricultural producers' cooperative can never be said to be a rash advance." Yang Yingtang said, "We must always look at the actual situation when doing work. Now that we have the actual conditions for expanding the agricultural producers' cooperative, if we do not expand the cooperative according to these conditions, then we will become tailism again." After repeated discussions, everyone unanimously affirmed that expanding the cooperative now was not a rash advance. After Zhang Huaibao and others realized the favorable conditions for expanding the cooperative, they also gave up their opinions. After the leadership thinking of the branch was unified, education was carried out on the closed-doorism thinking among the old cooperative members, and the benefits of expanding the cooperative for developing production were publicized, and the thinking of the old cooperative members was cleared. The agricultural producers' cooperative expanded from the original 102 households to 236 households.

Continuously Solving Problems in Progress

After the agricultural producers' cooperative expanded, it encountered a series of problems. In 1954, when organizing production teams, each team wanted people with strong labor power and high skills, and did not want semi-labor power and women. This situation existed not only among the general cooperative members, but also some Communist Party members showed serious departmentalism thinking. For example, Party member Gu Wenxian competed with Qu Bianze for good labor power when organizing the team, trying to pull all the people with strong labor power into his team. His team concentrated 12 full labor power. Qu Bianze's production team had only three full labor power. After the branch found that some Party members were not proceeding from the overall interests of the cooperative, it convened a Party meeting to conduct a self-criticism. At the meeting, everyone focused on criticizing Gu Wenxian's departmentalism. Under everyone's patient help, Gu Wenxian examined his mistakes and promised to allocate some labor power to Qu Bianze's production team. Through criticizing Gu Wenxian's departmentalism thinking, other Party members were also educated. Everyone said: "We must establish the concept of the whole and persuade the cooperative members to organize the production team well with our exemplary actions." After the meeting, Gu Wenxian also examined his erroneous departmentalism thinking in his production team, persuaded everyone, and allocated three full labor power, one semi-labor power, and one work point recorder to Qu Bianze's team. Under the influence of Gu Wenxian's actions, other production teams also appropriately reallocated labor power.

The Quzhai Agricultural Producers' Cooperative had implemented a system of contracting work and output in 1953, but later, because the crops were affected by disasters, and the cooperative's leading cadres did not have practical experience in contracting output, the original regulations were canceled. Based on the new situation of the agricultural producers' cooperative's increasing expansion, the branch decided to re-establish the system of contracting work and output.

After the branch made the decision, the Party member cadres of each labor team went to the cooperative members to carry out propaganda. The labor-active cooperative members were very much in favor of the propaganda of contracting work and output. Some said, "If we had implemented contracting work and output last year, we would not have harvested less grain." But some people disagreed. For example, Shen Fulin said, "I have never seen nails and plates, and I have never seen (fixed) output. Planting is in people, and harvesting is in the sky. It is not reliable to fix it now." The branch took out the situation that occurred after the cancellation of contracting work and output in 1953 to illustrate the necessity of establishing a contracting work and output system. After the cancellation of the contracting output method in 1953, some cooperative members felt that they were not afraid of losing output, so they became sloppy in their work. As a result, in the autumn, the grain harvested by each team was very unbalanced. Jia Songgui's production team led tightly, and the cooperative members worked seriously. The average yield per mu reached 30.5 dou. Zhang Huaibao's production team's land was even better than Jia Songgui's production team's land. Because the cooperative members were sloppy in their work after the cancellation of contracting output, the average yield per mu was only 21 dou.

Through such persuasion and education, the ideological obstacles were finally cleared; but when it came to the specific implementation of contracting work and output, problems arose again. When contracting work, everyone disliked the small amount of work; when contracting output, everyone disliked the high output. In order to solve this problem, the branch first conducted a typical investigation in Jia Songgui's production team. The branch lined up all the land in Jia Songgui's team, evaluated the work points, determined the output, and proposed excess production targets according to the cooperative's regulations on contracting output standards. Then, the branch used Jia Songgui's production team as an example to encourage other production teams to propose their own team's contracting work and output plans based on facts.

After the plans were made, some people had no confidence in completing the plans. Che Huailin said, "In the past, our village only harvested a few dou of grain per mu, but now it has reached more than two dan, and we still propose to increase production. I don't think this year's production increase plan will fail." Cooperative member Jia Bangzhi said, "Contracting output is a word, and we are not afraid of reducing output. We have two shoulders and a mouth. What is there to compensate for if we reduce output?" In order to ensure the implementation of the contracting work and output plan, the branch organized each production team to carry out a red flag competition, and stipulated that there would be visits and appraisals on the 13th of each month, and meetings would be held on the 15th to commend and reward good units and exchange experiences.

Each production team responded to the call of the branch and launched a red flag production competition in mid-March. However, some production teams did not carry out the competition vigorously enough due to insufficient ideological mobilization. Some cooperative members said, "No matter whether it is a competition or not, we will just grab the distribution tickets." When Qu Shuangquan's production team was repairing the water ditch, the original 100 work points contracted were only used 70 work points because the work was done roughly, and everyone asked to distribute the remaining 30 work points. Zhang Fanshan's production team did not fertilize according to the fertilization plan stipulated by the cooperative, and some cooperative members secretly applied good fertilizer to their private plots. After the Party branch discovered these problems, it organized the captains and deputy captains of each production team with the cooperative affairs committee to visit and inspect Jia Songgui's production team, which had carried out the competition well, and Zhang Fanshan's and other production teams, which had not carried out the competition. From the visits and inspections, everyone realized that if the labor competition was really carried out well, production would improve; if the labor competition was not carried out well, production would lag behind. After this visit and inspection, the labor competition was universally carried out in the whole cooperative, and under the encouragement of the competition, all 18 production teams in the cooperative completed the spring plowing and sowing tasks according to plan.

In the competition, the branch paid special attention to fighting complacency. Zhang Huaibao's team won the red flag twice in a row in the competition, and felt that they were remarkable. When it came to topdressing, other teams had topdressed, but Zhang Huaibao felt that the crops in his team were growing well and did not need to be topdressed. The branch strictly criticized this complacency through the appraisal activities. Zhang Huaibao made a self-criticism and expressed that he would resolutely overcome complacency and strive to overfulfill the production increase task. After Zhang Huaibao's team overcame complacency, they continued to win the red flag.

The labor competition lasted for six months from March 15, 1954 to September 15. As a result of the competition, not only was the contracting work and output plan implemented, but also the realization of the production increase task was guaranteed. The average yield per mu of the 1,672 mu of autumn land in the whole cooperative was 362 jin and 14 liang, which was 61 jin and 14 liang more than in 1953, exceeding the original production increase plan (50 jin) by 11 jin and 14 liang.

Now, the Quzhai Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative has developed to 293 households, basically meeting the requirements of collectivization in the whole village. They are confidently advancing along the socialist road under the leadership of the Party.

    编者按：中共山西省潞安县璩寨支部是在一九四七年正式成立的。在上级党委的领导下，这个支部的工作一贯是有成绩的。一九五三年中共山西省委曾决定在山西全省推广璩寨支部的工作经验。这篇通讯系统地叙述了璩寨支部怎样领导农民组织农业生产互助组，进而组织农业生产合作社的全部过程。目前，在农业生产合作化运动中，如何加强党对农业生产合作社的领导有着特别重要的意义，璩寨支部的工作经验可供各地参考。
    中共璩寨支部怎样领导农民走社会主义道路
    王耕溪
    从互助组到农业生产合作社
    早在一九四六年春天，山西省潞安县璩寨村的农民就响应了党和政府的号召，开始走上了“组织起来”的道路。经过几年来的发展，到一九五一年组织起来的农民就达到了全村农户总数的百分之九十以上，参加了互助组的农民普遍增了产。
    一九五一年秋后，潞安县举行了全县劳动模范大会，璩寨村支部的共产党员苟佩芳、苟发兴、车春兰，青年团员侯叶则，积极分子贾兴贵以劳动模范的身份参加了大会。在全县劳动模范大会上，介绍了南天河村试办农业生产合作社的办社经验。到会的人马上被这件新事情吸引住了。苟佩芳、苟发兴、车春兰、侯叶则和贾兴贵都感到要使农业生产提高一步，就得办社，他们趁着开会的空隙向南天河劳动模范探讨了办社的好处，会后，苟发兴、车春兰和贾兴贵还亲自到南天河农业生产合作社参观了一趟，学习了办社的方法。
    在南天河农业生产合作社的影响下，璩寨支委会就正式研究起办社的问题来，开始支委会中一部分委员对办社的意义认识不足，有的人说：“互助组也增了产，何必还要办社？”为了统一领导思想，支部委员会就“为什么要办社”这个问题展开了讨论。支部委员赵凤则说：“互助组是吃什种什，不能根据土质来种庄稼。要是咱们办起农业生产合作社来，就可以根据土质好坏栽种作物，这样就会多打粮食。”苟发兴在会上例举了一九五一年夏天互助组发生的一件不愉快的事情说：“有一次天刚刚下了一场透雨，正好锄苗子，组员郭水和要求组里先去给他锄，贾胖孩要求先去给他锄，别的组员也要先给自己干活，吵嚷了半天，争执不下，后来就散了组，因为散组荒了六十多亩谷。”这种结合本村实际情况的讨论，很快统一了领导思想，支委会一致认为互助组已经无法适应今后生产发展情况，党应该领导农民来办农业生产合作社。接着支委会又具体研究了办社的条件，苟发兴互助组党员数量多，骨干强，互助基础好，支委会就确定以苟发兴领导的互助组为基础来办社。
    办社的风声一传开，群众的思想马上混乱起来。贾仁贵老汉说：“办社就是‘归大堆’，往后吃喝都不能由自己啦。”璩满财怕“归大堆”把骡子也悄悄卖了。支部组织宣传员分工包户地向群众宣传办社的好处，说明办社并不是“归大堆”，并由参观过南天河农业生产合作社的人来给大家解释。
    经过细致的宣传动员，决定转社的苟发兴互助组，在全组十六户组员中仍有五户拿不定主意。老中农贾胖孩在互助组好搞个副业生产，怕入了社不随便，可是不入社又不愿离开互助组。有的是耽心入了社吃瓜、吃菜不方便，还有的是劳力弱，怕入了社要少分粮食。支部为了进一步解除群众的思想顾虑，请南天河村农业生产合作社副社长王臭孩，将办社中的各种问题仔细地向大家做了解释，这样才算把大家的思想疙瘩解开了。这次要求参加农业生产合作社的除苟发兴互助组的十六户组员外，许文景等三户农民也自愿报名入了社。
    办社的第一年
    农业生产合作社建立起来以后，怎样领导大家走向富裕的道路？当时支部对这一点是不大明确的。村里有个投机商人叫张得胜，做了三、四年投机生意，牟取了一千五百多万元（旧币，下同）的暴利，在村里常常宣扬：“养家种地、发财生意。”有些社员看到张得胜做生意得了大利，怪眼热，就向社干部提议：咱也抽出些人来去搞买卖吧，看人家做买卖多赚钱，咱光指这几亩地啥时才能发了财呢？社务干部接受了这些社员的意见，筹集了一千二百万元款子，派张有发等四个社员到晋南去贩卖铁货。
    这时，中共潞安县委正召开会议批判少数农业生产合作社经营商业的资本主义倾向，璩寨村农业生产合作社社长苟发兴参加这次会议，就大吃一惊。苟发兴回到村里后决心贯彻县委会议的精神，扭转社内的资本主义经营思想。支委会认真讨论了县委的指示，并决定首先在党内开展反对资本主义经营思想的斗争，使党员认识到发展资本主义对党的事业的危害。在思想检查中，社长苟发兴检讨说：“我受了资本主义思想的影响，差点把社办坏。”并答应马上写信给在外经营商业的社员，叫他们迅速回来。可是有些社员，还留恋做生意的“好处”。贾胖孩家娘说：“可不能把买卖停了啊，光靠这几亩地那顶甚事？”这时，恰好在外做生意的人回来了，社员们都估计这一回大概抓钱不少，不想四个做生意人误了两个多月的工，不但没赚上钱、还贴了本。支部马上抓住这个事实对社员进行了教育，说明这条路是走不通的。经过这些教育后，澄清了社员中“做生意”的念头。随后经过社员民主讨论，把做生意的资金买了四千斤豆饼、三百斤肥田粉，投入生产。
    农业生产合作社经营思想混乱，影响了社内生产秩序正常的进行。支部在澄清了资本主义的经营思想以后，开始着手整顿生产。当时社里的春耕生产正处在严重的混乱状态中，每天到下地的时候，社员们都来找社长要营生，甚至有时到吃饭时刻，社员还下不了地。好多社员在自留地干活一股劲，给社里干活就“磨洋工”。村里的互助组已经种完了地，农业生产合作社的社员们还在地里点玉茭。有人讽刺说：“人家社里有讲究，种的迟，收的多。”社员们听了这话，干活更泄气，有的说：“入社算是倒了霉，买卖没搞成，农业也稀松。”有的心里盘算着：不如早点出了社，自己顾自己，免的跟上社受害。社里的干部们看到这个情况发了愁。
    这年春耕生产结束以后，支委会决定在社内试行小包工的办法，来扭转生产上的混乱现象。这种办法是按劳动小组划分了耕作区，把每个耕作区的土地都评了工，包给小组来做，长工不退，短工不补。实行了这个办法后，干活“磨洋工”的现象减少了，可是做活粗糙，不讲究质量的现象仍然存在。党员贾胜则干活很马虎，部分社员看了就说：
  “人家党员还那样干，咱怕啥！”这些情况引起劳动积极的社员的不满，他们向社务干部提意见说：
  “社里要不把做活粗糙的毛病克服掉，秋后非减产不可。”党支部研究了这一情况，首先在党内批评了贾胜则的劳动态度。贾胜则接受了支部的批评，并在社员面前做了公开检讨。然后，支部又和社务委员会一同组织了检查组，下地检查了田间生产情况，对做得好的就进行表扬，做活粗糙的给以适当批评，并规定了做活特别好的要多记分，做活不够质量的要扣分，这样就慢慢地克服了生产中的混乱现象。
    农业生产合作社经过整顿后，社内出现了一片新气象。社里各样活儿都做在互助组的前面。
    秋收完毕以后，党支部又领导全村农民进行了生产评比总结；农业生产合作社每亩平均产量两石七斗二升，比没办社以前每亩多收一石零三升，比村里最好的互助组每亩多收六斗七升，比单干农民每亩多收一石五斗。全社十九户社员，有十七户分的粮食超过了往年。农业生产合作社用事实向群众显示了自己的优越性。人们反映：“入了农业生产合作社，走对了路。没入社的这回也摸清了农业生产合作社的底；走合作化道路没有错。”
    一步步地走
    农业生产合作社第一年办成功了，许多农民看到农业生产合作社确实能增产，纷纷报名要求入社。有一部分党员只看到了农民积极要求入社的一面，没有认真分析农民在入社过程中的复杂的思想情况，因而产生了“办大社”的思想。支部委员杨英堂说：“愿入社的咱就吸收，社越大越好，反正将来都要走这条路。”在这种情绪的支持下，农业生产合作社在一九五三年春天扩大到了一百二十七户，有些思想没有真正打通的人，也随大流入了社。
    社扩大了，有些人主张把牲口农具也作价归社。支部委员张怀保说：“农业生产合作社的公共财产越多，社员们在社里越安心，干脆把牲口农具一整归了公算啦。”于是就把社员的十二头牲口作价归了社。
    牲口作价入社以后，社里的债务增加了，每户社员平均负债达五十万元左右。有些刚进社的新社员，看到社里这么大的饥荒（负债）很耽心，说：“刚进社就顶了这么多饥荒，动弹一年还不知能落几个。”把牲口入了社的户思想上也挺不痛快，都觉得牲口入了社还不知道什么时候才能拿到钱。璩怀保原来在社里干活挺起劲，自把牲口入社以后，干活也泄了气，对着他老婆说：“看这样子，往后慢慢都得归公了，咱动弹不动弹也是给人家干。”牲口集中喂养以后，也带来许多困难，其中最大的困难是草料问题不好办，原来的养牲口户不愿投资，没牲口户投资不起，有时候实在没了办法，社里的干部就只好自己往里垫。这样一来，有些原来入社不坚定的户就动摇起来。社外群众的思想也很混乱。申天星等七户农民都赶紧卖掉了自己的牲口。开春以后，有些农民地也不修，粪也不送，都说：“说不定啥时就得入社啦，现在闹还不是给社里闹？”
    一九五三年春天正当群众思想混乱的时候，党中央发布了“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”和“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”，人民日报发表了
  “领导农业生产的关键何在”的社论，县委指示各村学习这些文件，结合纠正互助合作运动中的急躁冒进偏向。璩寨支部在贯彻县委的指示时，党员们的抵触情绪很大；一种人认为办大社和实行牲口作价入社都是为了“社会主义”，不能说成偏向；另一种人认为：纠正偏向不光彩，有的说：“群众的思想问题什么时候也会有的，只要以后教育教育就行了。”支部的领导思想对这个问题同样表现了犹豫动摇不定。
    中共潞安县委会，为了纠正盲目冒进的偏向，贯彻中央指示，召开了全县三级干部会议，璩寨支部书记苟佩芳和村长璩国元参加了县委召开的县、区、村三级干部会议。经过会议的教育，苟佩芳和璩国元认识到纠正偏向的重要意义，回村后他们领导全体党员展开了认真的讨论。经过讨论，统一了认识，大家认为：一定要从小农经济的特点出发，过去的做法是“老雕抓驴，不看对象”，想一步迈到社会主义，这样不但没有把工作做好，反而引起群众许多思想顾虑。党内思想明确了以后，又向群众进行了宣传。社务委员会接受支部的建议，并把社员作价入社的十二头牲口重新退给社员个人喂养，有二十五户不愿在社的农民自动出了社。
    经过纠正偏向，农业生产合作社巩固了，群众思想安定了。
    这年冬天，党提出了过渡时期的总路线，农民受了总路线的教育以后，都积极要求参加农业生产合作社，走社会主义道路。全村要求入社的农民共有一百四十多户。
    农民大批要求参加农业生产合作社，但是社的部分领导干部对新形势下面的群众新的觉悟程度认识不足；再加上一九五三年春天纠正冒进偏向的影响，他们不敢接受具有觉悟而又迫切要求入社的农民到社里来。社务委员侯叶则说：“经过纠正偏向后，现在咱的社才巩固好，要是再扩大又会出问题。”支部委员会针对这种情况，首先开会作了研究。会上，支部书记苟佩芳说：“经过总路线的宣传，群众的社会主义觉悟提高了，都积极要求参加农业生产合作社，这和当年硬把农民拉进来的情况根本不同。咱们社应当根据实际情况扩大，满足群众的要求。”他提议应把农业生产合作社扩大到二百户以上。支委路计锁、程四孝同意苟佩芳的意见。程四孝说：“宣传总路线就是为了叫大家走社会主义道路，社里关起门来叫大家往那走？”但是这些意见马上遭到支部委员张怀保的反对，他说：“春天刚反了冒进，现在又要扩社，这不是来回圪倒吗？”支部书记苟佩芳根据两方面的意见提出扩社到底算不算冒进的问题，让大家讨论，你三言我五语，纷纷发表了自己的意见。路计锁发言说：“今年春天犯盲目冒进的错误，是因为支部有急躁情绪，没有从当时的实际情况出发，现在和今年春天的情况不同了，宣传了总路线，群众看清了走社会主义道路的好处，再说，支部领导办社的经验也多啦，在这种情况下扩大农业生产合作社绝不能说成是冒进。”杨英堂发言说：“做工作总得看实际情况，现在有了扩大农业生产合作社的实际条件，要是咱们不根据这些条件来扩社，那就又会变成尾巴主义。”经过反复讨论，大家一致肯定了现在扩社不是冒进。张怀保等人认识到扩社的有利条件以后，也放弃了自己的意见。支部的领导思想取得一致后，又针对老社员中的关门主义思想进行了教育，宣传了扩社对发展生产的好处，打通了老社员的思想。农业生产合作社由原来的一百零二户扩大到二百三十六户。不断解决前进中的问题
    农业生产合作社扩大以后碰到了一连串的问题。一九五四年在编生产小队的时候，那个队也想要劳力强的和技术高的人，都不想要半劳动力和妇女。这种情况不仅在一般社员中存在，而且有些共产党员也表现了严重的本位主义思想。如党员谷文先在编队时和璩扁则争好劳力，设法把劳力强的都拉到他队里，他的小队里集中了十二个全劳动力。璩扁则生产小队却只有三个全劳动力。支部发现有些党员不从全社的整体利益出发的现象后，就召开了党的会议进行检查，会上，大家着重批判了谷文先的本位主义。谷文先在大家的耐心帮助下，检查了自己的错误，并答应给璩扁则生产小队拨一部分劳动力。通过批判谷文先的本位主义思想，也同时教育了其他党员，大家都表示：要树立整体观念，以自己的模范行动，说服社员编好生产小队。会后，谷文先在他的生产小队里也检讨了错误的本位主义思想，说服大家，拨了三个全劳力、一个半劳力、一个记工员给璩扁则小队，在谷文先的行动影响下，其他各生产小队也适当地调配了劳力。
    璩寨农业生产合作社在一九五三年曾经实行过包工包产的制度，后来因为庄稼受灾，社的领导干部也没有包产的实际经验，就把原来的规定取消了。根据农业生产合作社日益扩大的新情况，支部决定：重新建立包工包产的制度。
      支部决定后，各劳动小队的党员干部便分头向社员进行了宣传，劳动积极的社员听了宣传包工包产都很赞成。有的说：“要是去年咱就执行包工包产，也不会少收了粮食。”可是也有些人不同意，如申福林说：“钉盘子钉碗，还没见过钉（定）产，种在人、收在天，现在定了也靠不住。”支部拿出一九五三年取消包工包产以后，所产生的情况，来说明建立包工包产制度的必要性。一九五三年包产的办法一取消，有些社员觉得不怕赔产啦，干活便马虎起来，结果到秋天各小队打的粮食很不平衡，贾松贵生产小队领导抓得紧，社员们干活认真，每亩地平均产量达到三石零五升，张怀保生产小队的土地比贾松贵生产小队的土地还好，因为取消包产以后，社员们干活马虎，每亩地平均产量只收到两石一斗。
    通过这样的说服教育，终于清除了思想障碍；但是在具体进行包工包产的时候，问题又出来了。包工时，大家都嫌工少，包产时，都嫌产高。支部为了解决这个问题，首先在贾松贵生产小队里做了典型的调查。支部将贾松贵全队的土地排了队，评出工数、定出产量、并根据社规定的包产标准，提出超额增产指标。然后，支部以贾松贵生产小队为榜样，启发其他生产小队实事求是的提出自己小队的包工包产计划。
    计划订出来以后，有些人对完成计划没有信心。车怀林说：“从前咱们村一亩地只打几斗粮食，如今已经打到两石多了，还提出要增产，我看今年的增产计划非落空不可。”社员贾梆只说：“包产是句话，减产也不怕，咱两肩膀抗着个嘴，减了产有啥赔？”支部为了保证包工包产计划的执行，就组织各生产小队开展红旗竞赛，并规定每月十三日进行参观评比，十五日开会表扬、奖励好的单位，交流经验。
    各个生产小队响应了支部的号召，在三月中旬展开了红旗生产竞赛。但有些生产小队由于思想发动不够，竞赛搞得不起劲。有的社员说：“不管它竞赛不竞赛，咱只要抓上分票就算。”璩双全生产小队在修水濠时，原包的一百个工，因为活儿干的粗糙，只用了七十个工，余下的三十个工大家要求分了。张反山生产小队不按社里规定的施肥计划施肥，有些社员们偷偷地把好肥料垩到自留地上。党支部发现这些问题后，就和社务委员会组织了各生产小队的正副队长到竞赛开展得好的贾松贵生产小队和竞赛没有开展起来的张反山等生产小队去参观检查。从参观检查中，使大家认识到，劳动竞赛真正开展得好，生产就会有起色；劳动竞赛开展得不好，生产就落后。经过这次参观检查，劳动竞赛在全社普遍开展起来，在竞赛的鼓舞下，全社十八个生产小队全部按计划完成了春耕播种任务。
    竞赛中，支部特别注意和自满情绪作斗争。张怀保小队在竞赛中连得了两次红旗，觉得自己了不起啦。到上追肥的时候，别的小队都上了追肥，张怀保却觉得自己小队的庄稼长得好，不需要再上追肥了。支部通过评比的活动对这种骄傲自满情绪严格地进行了批评。张怀保作了检讨，表示要坚决克服自满情绪，争取超额完成增产任务。张怀保小队克服骄傲情绪以后，又连续获得了红旗。
    劳动竞赛从一九五四年三月十五日开始到九月十五日为止，共进行了六个月。竞赛的结果，不仅贯彻了包工包产的计划，而且保证了增产任务的实现。全社一千六百七十二亩秋地，每亩平均产量三百六十二斤十四两，比一九五三年多收六十一斤十四两，超过原增产计划（五十斤）十一斤十四两。
    现在，璩寨村农业生产合作社已经发展到二百九十三户，基本上达到全村合作化的要求。他们正沿着社会主义道路在党的领导下满怀信心地前进。
