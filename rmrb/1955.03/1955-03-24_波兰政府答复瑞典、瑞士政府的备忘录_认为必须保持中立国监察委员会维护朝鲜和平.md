Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 23rd: According to the Polish Press Agency on the 22nd: On January 27th, the Swedish government and the Swiss government notified the Polish government of the full text of the memoranda they had sent to the government of the People's Republic of China and the United States government. In these memoranda, the Swedish and Swiss governments announced that they themselves favored ending the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, or reducing the number of personnel on the commission.
    Regarding the above issues, the diplomatic representatives of the Polish People's Republic stationed in Stockholm and Bern have submitted memoranda to the Swedish and Swiss governments.
    In its memorandum, the Polish People's Republic emphasized that Poland initially agreed to participate in the work of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission because it believed that its participation in the commission could contribute to a lasting and peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Although this goal has not yet been fully achieved due to the fault of certain individuals who are not interested in a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, the Polish government believes that the existence of the commission and its supervision of the implementation of the armistice agreement are important and positive factors in maintaining peace in Korea and peace throughout the world.
    In its nearly two years of activity, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has proven that it is capable of effectively and successfully carrying out its tasks. This explains why the government of the Polish People's Republic believes that it is necessary to maintain the commission and further participate in its work.
    However, the Polish government believes that it is possible to study the issue of reducing the number of personnel on the commission through understanding between the countries participating in the commission, provided that the reduction in personnel does not weaken the commission's ability to perform the tasks stipulated in the armistice agreement.

    波兰政府答复瑞典、瑞士政府的备忘录
    认为必须保持中立国监察委员会维护朝鲜和平
     【新华社华沙二十三日电】据波兰通讯社二十二日讯：一月二十七日，瑞典政府和瑞士政府把它们已经送交中华人民共和国政府和美国政府的备忘录的全文通知波兰政府。在这些备忘录中，瑞典政府和瑞士政府宣布它们本身赞成结束在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会的活动，或者缩减委员会的人员。
    关于上述问题，波兰人民共和国驻斯德哥尔摩和驻伯尔尼的外交代表已向瑞典政府和瑞士政府提出了备忘录。
    波兰人民共和国在备忘录中着重指出，波兰当初答应参加朝鲜中立国监察委员会的工作，是由于认为它参加委员会的工作可以对朝鲜问题的持久而和平的解决有所贡献。虽然由于对朝鲜问题的和平解决不感兴趣的某些人士的过失而使这个目标还没有完全达到，但是波兰政府认为委员会的存在以及它对停战协定的实施进行的监督，是维护朝鲜和平和全世界和平的一个重要的积极因素。
    中立国监察委员会在它将近两年的活动过程中，已经证明它是能够有效而成功地执行它的任务的。这就说明为什么波兰人民共和国政府认为必须保持委员会并进一步参加委员会的工作。
    但是，波兰政府认为，通过参加委员会工作的各国之间的谅解，对于裁减委员会人员的问题予以研究是可能的，不过条件是：缩减人员不致削弱委员会执行停战协定所规定的任务的能力。
