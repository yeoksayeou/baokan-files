Using Persuasion and Education to Mobilize the Masses
——Experiences of CCP Tongyang Township Branch Committee Member Tong Hanyao in Leading Mass Production
Zhang Li

Tong Hanyao, a member of the CCP Tongyang Township Branch Committee in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, got up early. When he pushed open the door, the east was already crimson. The spring snow had completely melted, and the wheat seedlings in the fields were lush and green, the perfect time for accumulating and applying fertilizer. However, the fields were quiet, and the nearby farm boats were still properly overturned in their sheds. These conditions did not surprise him. The grain requisition, purchase, and sale work in the township had concluded, but the ideological concerns of the masses had not yet been eliminated, and there was a sense of wanting to rest. He remembered the instructions from the higher-level Party: After the conclusion of the requisition, purchase, and sale work, it was necessary to promptly publicize the Party's policy of encouraging increased production and lead the masses to carry out spring production.

After breakfast, Tong Hanyao went out to visit people. He went to the home of middle peasant Guo Mingyue and saw Guo Mingyue sitting on a stool, listless, while the farm boat remained overturned at home.

"Mingyue! The weather is so good, you can dredge mud!" "Where can I get the energy for production? Dredging more mud only leaves this much rations; not dredging is the same." Tong Hanyao knew that Guo Mingyue had always liked to hoard surplus grain at home, only selling it when needing money. This time, he had sold 2,900 jin of surplus grain, including wheat. Because he no longer saw the high grain pile, he worried about not having enough to eat. "How much do you think is enough?" "Each person needs at least a sheng of rice every day!" "According to your calculation, your family of three would eat more than 2,900 jin of rice a year. You only harvested more than 3,600 jin of rice the year before last. After selling 2,000 jin, the remaining amount wasn't even enough for rations. After deducting seeds and public grain, how could there have been a surplus of more than 400 jin of rice later?" Tong Hanyao calculated and said, "According to your family's overall account from the year before last, your family harvested 4,600 jin of rice last year. The 1,230 jin of rations you have kept this year is not a small amount!" Tong Hanyao also helped Guo Mingyue calculate the account of his family's more than 1,600 jin of non-staple foods, and smiled, "Mingyue, calculate it again, it's enough!" Guo Mingyue calculated carefully and remained silent. Tong Hanyao continued, "In the past, we only kept a rough account. After the rice was harvested, we spent it piecemeal. We never kept track of how much rations we needed in a year. Now, we must live our lives in a planned way, and we will gradually get used to it. Furthermore, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, supporting industrialization, and improving our own lives all depend on increasing production. It's not right to not plan to increase production!" He also told Guo Mingyue the reasoning that increasing production would benefit him more. Guo Mingyue smiled and said, "I thought we would keep this amount of grain every year. This is reasonable!"

After visiting seven or eight households, Tong Hanyao understood the ideological situation of the middle peasants and had a better grasp of the situation. He then worked with Chen Qianfa, the village head of Beitong Village, to arrange production: all 744 mu of paddy fields in the village still lacked base fertilizer, 57 mu of wheat fields had not yet been top-dressed, and rice borer control had not been carried out. He then mobilized Party members and activists to actively lead production at the branch general meeting in Beitong Village. Next, he assisted the village head in convening a villagers' meeting. By summarizing the requisition, purchase, and sale work, he addressed the ideological concerns of the masses, publicized the principle that increasing production would benefit them more, and had new Party member Li Yu and activist Li Chunlian introduce their family living plans. He then used Guo Mingyue's example to educate everyone on increasing production and practicing thrift. Because three households, including Shen Bushan in the township, had sold too much grain and had repaired their houses and hired casual laborers last year, they were issued additional grain purchase certificates. In this way, the ideological concerns of both surplus grain households and grain-deficient households were finally dispelled. Then, after setting production plans and organizing labor, the entire village mobilized 26 boats to dredge mud and carry manure. Middle peasant Guo Mingyue also bought a castrated ox.

Although the masses had been mobilized, Tong Hanyao did not become complacent or satisfied. He still frequently went to the village to check things out, discovered new problems, and helped solve them in a timely manner. One day, he went to the homes of Tong Fengyu and Tong Haichang (poor peasants), who were new members of the Beitong Agricultural Production Cooperative, and saw them idle at home. When he asked them why they weren't working, they said they didn't have boats to dredge mud. Tong Hanyao also saw middle peasant Tong Shunyu heading out with his own boat. When he asked him where he was going, he said, "Now that I've joined the cooperative, the fields are managed by the cooperative. I can go out and make a living for a month or two." Tong Hanyao thought to himself: The cooperative is in short supply of boats for accumulating fertilizer, but boat owners are going out on their own. Isn't this a problem? Tong Hanyao stopped middle peasant Tong Shunyu and patiently enlightened him: "Now that you've joined the cooperative, you must do a good job in the cooperative's production and not just take care of yourself. If the cooperative's production doesn't go well, it will be detrimental to industrial construction, and everyone's lives cannot be improved; you have a boat, which can be used by the cooperative in a unified way, accumulate fertilizer for the cooperative, and earn work points, which is beneficial to everyone." He also helped Tong Shunyu calculate the accounts: "Each time you take your boat out, you can carry a hundred loads of manure. The cooperative would then have at least five hundred fewer loads of manure. If 20 mu of wheat fields don't get top-dressed, they will yield 1,600 jin less wheat. The loss would be immeasurable!" These words cleared up middle peasant Tong Shunyu's thinking. That evening, Tong Hanyao researched the situation at the cooperative's management committee. At the members' meeting, the cooperative committee conducted collectivist education for the members on "the cooperative is for everyone, and everyone is for the cooperative," clarifying the new members' "self-centered" thinking. The entire cooperative set short-term production plans, discussed work point standards, and unified the organization of 23 laborers, four boats for carrying manure, and five boats for dredging mud. The next day, poor peasants Tong Fengyu and Tong Haichang went out to carry manure together with middle peasant Tong Shunyu. Now, 70 percent of the wheat fields in the Beitong Agricultural Production Cooperative have been top-dressed.

With the able-bodied men all organized to accumulate fertilizer, the rice borer control work fell on the women. When they were first mobilized to pull rice roots to control rice borers, the women said:
"Last year's snow was heavy, and it was terribly cold. The pests must have frozen to death. There's no need to control them." Some were afraid of the trouble, saying: "The rice roots are endless, can you pull them all out?" Everyone didn't believe in the benefits of burning rice roots. Tong Hanyao discussed with activist Zhou Wengui and pulled out a few handfuls of rice roots. First, they held a women's meeting in the agricultural cooperative, peeled open the rice roots, took out three worms, placed them in the palm of their hand, and breathed a few puffs of warm air. The worms slowly wriggled. The women exclaimed, "There really are borers! They move when they get warm air!" Then everyone chatted about the harm of rice borers. Old Granny Shen Bushan, 57, smacked her lips and said, "Last year, half of my late rice 'dropped white.' I thought it was fate, but it turns out these 'spendthrifts' were the cause. This time, we must eliminate them completely!" A rice borer control team was organized on the spot. The next day, the entire cooperative mobilized 26 women to pick up rice roots, clearing one area and then another. Many women and children in the village came to watch the rice borer control. That evening, a meeting was held in the village. The agricultural cooperative introduced the process of mobilizing rice borer control, solved the ideological problems of the masses, and organized seven rice borer control teams.

In this way, the rice borer control work in Beitong Village was carried out enthusiastically. In five days, 174 and a half mu of wheat fields had all had their rice roots pulled out, ready to be burned and used as ash fertilizer.

    用说服教育的方法发动群众
    ——中共童杨乡支部委员童汉尧领导群众生产的经验
    张立
    中共江苏省盐城县童杨乡支部委员童汉尧大早起身，推门出来，东方已经一片通红。春雪融化尽了，田里的麦苗青葱茂盛，正是积肥追肥的好时机。可是，田野间静悄悄的，附近的农船还在棚里扣得好好的。这些情况并不使他奇怪，全乡的粮食征、购、销工作结束了，群众的思想顾虑还没有消除，存在着歇劲思想。他记住上级党的指示：在征、购、销工作结束之后，要及时宣传党的鼓励增产的政策，领导群众开展春季生产。
    早饭后，童汉尧就出去串门了。他到中农郭明月家，看见郭明月坐在凳上，没精打采的，农船却扣在家里。
    “明月！天这样好，可以罱泥啦！”“哪来劲头生产，多罱泥也只留这些口粮，不罱也一样。”童汉尧知道郭明月过去一向喜欢把余粮囤在家里，要用钱才卖。这次连麦子一起卖了二千九百斤余粮，因为不再看见高高的粮囤，于是就担心不够吃了。“你说多少才够啦？”“每天每口少不了升把米！”“照你算，你家三口，一年要吃二千九百多斤稻哩，你前年只收三千六百多斤稻，除了卖掉二千斤，剩下的连口粮还不够哩，除去种子、公粮，后来怎会多余四百多斤稻的呢？”童汉尧算了又算说：“照前年你家的生活总账，去年你家收了四千六百斤稻，今年留的一千二百三十斤口粮并不少呐！”童汉尧又教郭明月算了家里一千六百多斤副食品的账，笑道：“明月，你再算算，够啦！”郭明月仔细计算了一下，不吱声了。童汉尧接着说：“过去我们只会匡肚账，稻子收到家，零零散散花，一年究竟要多少口粮，自己也没数，现在可要有计划的过日子啦，慢慢会习惯的。再说，支援解放台湾，支援工业化，改善自己生活全靠增加生产嘛，不打算增产的思想可不对呀！”他又把多增产，对自己好处多的道理告诉郭明月，郭明月笑起来说：“我以为年年留这些粮哩，这可合理啦！”
    访问了七、八户，童汉尧掌握了中农的思想情况，心里有了数，又与北童村村长陈前发把生产排了队：全村七百四十四亩水田还没有基肥，五十七亩麦田还没追肥，治螟也没开展。他就在北童村的支部大会上发动党员、积极分子去积极领导生产。接着，他又协助村长召开村民大会，通过总结征、购、销工作，针对群众的思想顾虑，宣传多增产，对自己好处多的道理，并由新党员李郁、积极分子李春连介绍家庭生活计划，再把郭明月的实例向大家进行增产节约教育。乡里沈步善等三户由于带头卖粮过多和去年修屋、雇散工，口粮不够吃，又补发了购粮证。这样，余粮户、缺粮户的思想顾虑终于打消了。接着经过订生产计划，组织劳力，全村出动了二十六条船罱泥、挑粪，中农郭明月还买进了一头犍牛。
    群众虽然发动起来了，但童汉尧并没有产生松懈自满情绪，他还经常到村里去遛转，发现新的问题并及时帮助解决。一天，他到北童农业生产合作社的新社员童凤余、童海昌（贫农）家去，看见他们在家里闲着，问他们为什么不干活，他们说没船罱泥。童汉尧又看见中农童顺余撑了自己的船出门了，问他上哪去，他却说：“入了社，田里由社经管，自己可以出门混个把月生活了。”童汉尧心里想：社里正缺船积肥，有船户却独个儿出门，不是个问题吗？童汉尧叫住了中农童顺余，好言好语开导他：“入了社，就要把社里的生产搞好，不能光顾自己。要是社里生产搞不好，对工业建设不利，大家的生活也不能改善；你有船，由社里统一使用，给社里积了肥，又拿到工分，大家有利。”又帮童顺余算了账：“你一条船出去一次可挑百把担粪，社里就至少要少挑五百担粪，二十亩麦田追不上肥，就要少收一千六百斤麦子，损失没底哩！”这一席话，把中农童顺余的思想打通了。那天晚上，童汉尧把情况在社务委员会上作了研究。在社员大会上，社委会对社员进行了“社为人人、人人为社”的集体主义教育，澄清了新社员“自顾自”的思想。全社订好小段生产计划，讨论了工分标准，统一组织了二十三个劳动力，四条船挑粪，五条船罱泥。隔天，贫农童凤余、童海昌与中农童顺余一起出门挑粪了。现在北童农业生产合作社百分之七十的麦田都已追上了肥。
    壮年男子都组织起来积肥了，治螟工作就落在妇女身上。开始发动拔稻根治螟时，妇女们却说：
  “去年雪大，冷得凶，害虫早冻死了，不用治了。”有的怕麻烦，说：“稻根没底多，拔得光吗？”大家不相信烧稻根的好处，童汉尧和积极分子周文贵商量，拔了几把稻根子，先在农业合作社里开了个妇女会，把稻根剥开来，取出三条虫来，放在手掌心，呵几口热气，虫子慢慢蠕动起来。妇女们看了直嚷：“真有螟哩，碰上热气就动呐！”接着大家扯谈起螟虫的危害来。五十七岁的沈步善老奶奶啧着嘴说：“去年晚蛮稻‘白掉’一半，我还说是天意，原来是这些‘败家子’作怪，这回要铲草除根！”当场组织了治螟小组。第二天全社出动了二十六个妇女拾稻根，拔一块清一块，全村许多妇女、儿童来观看治螟。晚上，村里开了会，农业社介绍发动治螟经过，解决了群众的思想问题，组织起七个治螟小组。
    就这样，北童村的治螟工作热烈开展起来，五天时间，一百七十四亩半的麦田已经全部拔掉了稻根，准备烧毁后做灰肥。
