Who is Obstructing Disarmament and Preparing for Atomic War
    Tan Wenrui

    The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee is holding a meeting in London. This meeting has naturally received widespread attention from people of all countries, because the issues discussed at the meeting are major issues related to the security and interests of the people of all countries: universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This is also the question of whether mankind is to suffer the disaster of an atomic war.

    The people of the world are enthusiastically launching a signature campaign against atomic war and demanding the destruction of atomic and hydrogen weapons. They eagerly expect that, on the favorable basis provided by the new Soviet proposal, major powers can engage in serious discussions on the issue of universal disarmament and the elimination of the threat of atomic war, and achieve positive results.

    Proceeding from the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, and at the same time advocated the universal reduction of conventional armaments by all countries. The Soviet Union’s recent proposal on the destruction of atomic weapons, the limitation of armaments, and the convening of a world disarmament conference is a new and major effort by the Soviet Union in this regard. These Soviet proposals, aimed at eliminating the war crisis and safeguarding world peace, have not only been universally supported by the people of all countries, but have also been welcomed by many people in the bourgeoisie of Western countries who are willing to see peace. If the ruling groups of the United States and Britain are sincerely for world peace, they should welcome these Soviet proposals and use them as a basis to quickly reach an international agreement.

    However, the US-British group of countries not only tried their best to evade discussing the Soviet proposals at the London Disarmament Conference, but, according to the Associated Press, they also brazenly put forward an absurd plan that required peace-loving and democratic countries to unilaterally reduce their armed forces, in an attempt to create a deadlock in the disarmament negotiations. They even used the pretext of the Soviet Union's publication of news about the well-known position of the Soviet delegation to accuse the Soviet Union of violating the "rules of confidentiality" of the conference, attempting to give the impression that it was the Soviet Union, and not the Western countries, that was deliberately undermining the disarmament conference. This approach by Western countries precisely demonstrates that they have ulterior motives regarding the issues discussed at the conference. People cannot help but notice that just when the Disarmament Conference needed the major countries participating in the conference to earnestly explore an agreement on the urgent and major issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the chief representative of the United States attending the conference, Lodge, left London for New York on the 12th, which was exactly the same as the work slowdown of the chief representative of the US delegation during the Geneva Conference. Moreover, according to news from American news agencies, the US chief representative’s departure from the Disarmament Conference midway was “decided before the conference began.” It is most obvious that the United States does not intend to allow the conference to conduct any substantive discussions on the urgent and major issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, which concerns the interests of the people of the whole world. The US-British group simply does not want disarmament, let alone the abolition of atomic weapons. They fear that this will cause them to lose their main tool for conducting atomic blackmail. In fact, Lodge, the representative attending the Disarmament Conference, even claimed before the conference that the United States "absolutely cannot give up" the "right" to use atomic weapons; British Defense Minister Macmillan also openly said: "There is no room for compromise on the issue of disarmament."

    As long as you look at the facts, you can see that the US-British ruling groups not only do not have the slightest intention of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, but what they have done is precisely the opposite of the tasks that the Disarmament Conference should complete. In the recent period, ignoring the just calls of the people of all countries, they have become increasingly crazy in preparing for atomic war. They not only continue to advocate the expansion of atomic armaments, but also openly base their strategic plans on the use of atomic weapons, and step up preparations for atomic war. US Secretary of State Dulles recently openly stated at the Bangkok Conference that the current US military strategy in the Far East is based on the concept of treating atomic bombs as "conventional defensive weapons." British Defense Minister Macmillan also said in Parliament that the North Atlantic Group has decided to formulate war preparedness plans based on the principle of using nuclear weapons in major wars. According to this sinful plan, the United States is preparing to equip the West German defense forces with atomic weapons once they are rebuilt. Britain also announced that it would reorganize its navy, army, and air force in accordance with "the conditions of the nuclear age." The United States is testing atomic weapons more and more frequently, Britain has announced its decision to manufacture hydrogen bombs, and the countries of the North Atlantic Group regularly hold "atomic war" exercises in Northern Europe. What matches these practical steps in preparing for atomic war is the increasingly unrestrained clamor for atomic war. Dulles, Radford, Gruenther, and other figures who occupy not unimportant positions in the US government threaten to use atomic weapons almost every day. British Prime Minister Churchill also followed suit, openly declaring that the cities and ports of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are the targets of Anglo-American planned atomic attacks.

    Politicians and propaganda machines on both sides of the Atlantic have recently been particularly garrulous in repeating the cliché of so-called "preventing communist aggression" to defend the US-British group's expansion of atomic armaments and preparation for atomic war. They insisted that because the Soviet Union has an "advantage in conventional armaments," Western countries must expand atomic armaments to maintain a "balance of power." British Prime Minister Churchill recently attached a new term to the West's "policy of strength," calling it "deterrence through defense," which in fact only more blatantly shows the threatening nature of the Western "policy of strength."

    Everyone knows that the so-called "Soviet aggression threat" is a bankrupt ghost story. Many Western politicians admit that there is no threat of "Soviet aggression" at all. Even Churchill said more than a year ago that "domestic prosperity, not foreign aggression" is the Soviet Union's "long-term interest." It can be seen from this that the reason why the US-British aggressor group tirelessly repeats the old tune is only for one purpose, which is to divert people's attention from the fact that they are expanding atomic armaments and preparing for a war of aggression.

    US Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss said last October in the US Senate Appropriations Committee: "According to the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all the benefits of thermonuclear weapons should be used to ensure the dominance of the United States." These practitioners of "strength policy" attempt to rely on the power of atomic weapons to dictate to the people of all countries, and vainly attempt to use this "advantage," which no longer exists, to blackmail the peace-loving and democratic countries. Isn't it clear? The US-British ruling groups are afraid of the pressure of the people, and pretend to advocate disarmament, but the facts prove that they are trying to obstruct an agreement on this issue, and instead create a tense atmosphere to cover up their continued expansion of armaments and crazy development of atomic weapons.

    The US-British group's frenzied manufacture and stockpiling of atomic weapons can only lead to an unlimited atomic arms race. Historical experience has proven countless times that an arms race will only lead to war. All sober-minded people will never be deceived by the ravings of the "nuclear weapons can increase the chances of world peace" type. In fact, the recent words and deeds of Western atomic maniacs in advocating atomic war have aroused great indignation and unease among the people of all countries. Indian Member of Parliament Sahib Singh Soque publicly condemned the United States’ conspiracy to use the “decision to use atomic bombs as conventional weapons” in Asia, believing that it showed that “Westerners want to affirm their claims to colonize Asia.” The recent debates in the British Parliament also revealed that many British members of Parliament were deeply dissatisfied with the threat of hydrogen bomb war caused by Churchill's speech. Alexander Comfort, a famous British scientist and writer, pointed out at a mass rally in London against preparations for atomic war that the British government's decision to manufacture hydrogen weapons is another obstacle to disarmament. It can be seen that the world's public can see who is obstructing disarmament and preparing for atomic war. The world's public has clearly seen the real danger to the peace and security of all countries contained in the Western group's advocacy of the atomic arms race, so they unanimously demanded the destruction of atomic weapons.

    The atomic war planners' attempt to use deceptive clamor to drown out the world's call for the destruction of atomic weapons is futile. No smokescreen can cover up the heinous crimes of the Western aggressor group in preparing for atomic war. When the peace-loving people of the world sign the declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, they are clearly aware of the great significance of their actions. They will continue to strengthen the struggle and firmly believe that the power of the people can crush the atomic maniacs' evil conspiracy to lead the world to atomic war.

    谁在阻挠裁军和准备原子战争
    谭文瑞
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会正在伦敦举行会议，这个会议理所当然地受到各国人民普遍的注意，因为会议所讨论的问题是关系到各国人民的安全和利益的重大问题：普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器。这也就是人类是否要遭受一次原子战争的灾祸的问题。
    世界各国人民正在如火如荼地展开反对原子战争、要求销毁原子武器和氢武器的签名运动。他们迫切期望在苏联新建议所提供的有利的基础上，各大国之间能够就普遍裁军和消除原子战争威胁问题展开认真的商谈，获致肯定的成就。
    从不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则出发，多年来苏联一贯地主张无条件禁止原子武器，同时主张普遍裁减各国的常规军备。苏联最近提出的关于销毁原子武器、限制军备和召开世界裁军会议的建议，是苏联在这方面一次新的重大努力。苏联的这些旨在消弭战争危机，保障世界和平的建议不但得到各国人民普遍的拥护，而且受到西方国家资产阶级中间许多愿意看到和平的人士的欢迎。美英统治集团如果真心为了世界的和平，就应该欢迎苏联的这些建议，并且以它们作为基础来迅速达成国际协议。
    然而，美英集团国家不但在伦敦裁军会议中极力规避讨论苏联的建议，而且据美联社的透露，它们还蛮横无理地提出一个要求和平民主国家单方面裁减武装部队的荒谬方案，以图给裁军问题的谈判制造僵局。他们甚至借口苏联发表了关于苏联代表团的众所周知的立场的新闻，穷极无聊地污蔑苏联违反会议的“保密规则”，企图使人得到印象，好像是苏联而不是西方国家在那里处心积虑地破坏裁军会议。西方国家的这种作法，正好说明了它们在会议所讨论的问题上，有着不可告人的意图。人们不能不注意到：正当裁军会议需要参加会议的各主要国家认真探求关于裁减军备和废除原子武器的协议时，美国出席会议的首席代表洛奇却在十二日离开伦敦，回纽约去了，情形正好同在日内瓦会议期间美国代表团首席代表的怠工行为一样。而且据美国通讯社的消息，美国首席代表中途离开裁军会议，原来是“在会议开始以前就已决定了的”。最明显不过，美国不打算让会议就裁减军备和禁止原子武器这个全世界人民利益攸关的迫切重大问题进行任何切实的讨论。美英集团根本不想裁军，更不想废除原子武器，他们害怕这会使他们失去进行原子讹诈的主要工具。事实上，出席裁军会议的代表洛奇甚至在会前就声称：美国“绝对不能放弃”使用原子武器的“权利”；英国国防大臣麦克米伦也公然说：“在裁军问题上是没有妥协余地的。”
    只要看一看事实，就可以知道，美英统治集团不仅没有丝毫裁减军备和禁止原子武器的意思，而且他们的所作所为恰恰是和裁军会议所应完成的任务背道而驰的。最近一个时期来，它们不顾各国人民的正义呼声，在准备原子战争方面，是益发疯狂了。它们不仅继续鼓吹扩张原子军备，并且公开把它们的战略计划放在使用原子武器的基础上，加紧准备原子战争。美国国务卿杜勒斯最近在曼谷会议上就公开声明，目前美国在远东的军事战略以把原子弹当作“常规防御武器”的观念作为基础。英国国防大臣麦克米伦在议会中也说北大西洋集团已决定了要根据在大战中使用核子武器这一原则来拟定备战计划。按照这种罪恶的计划，美国准备在西德国防军一旦重建起来，就用原子武器来装备他们。英国还宣布它要按照“核子时代的条件”改建它的海、陆、空军。美国试验原子武器愈来愈频繁了，英国公布了制造氢弹的决定，同时北大西洋集团国家又定期在北欧举行“原子战争”演习。和它们这些实际准备原子战争的步骤配合的，是愈来愈放肆的原子战争叫嚣。美国的杜勒斯、雷德福、格仑瑟等在美国政府中占据并非不重要的地位的人物几乎天天在威胁要使用原子武器。英国的首相邱吉尔也跟随着发出呐喊，公然宣告以苏联和人民民主国家的城市和港口等等为英美计划中的原子攻击的目标。
    大西洋两岸的政客和宣传机器近来特别喋喋不休地重复所谓“防止共产主义侵略”的陈词滥调来为美英集团扩张原子军备、准备原子战争进行辩护。他们硬说，由于苏联拥有“常规军备的优势”，西方国家必须扩张原子军备以维持“实力均衡”。英国首相邱吉尔最近还替西方国家这种“实力政策”按上了一个新的名辞，叫做什么“寓防御于威慑”，实际上只是更加露骨地表现西方“实力政策”的威胁性质。
    谁都知道，所谓“苏联侵略威胁”是早已破了产的鬼话。西方的许多政界人士都承认根本不存在什么“苏联侵略”的威胁。甚至邱吉尔在一年多以前也说过：“国内的繁荣，而不是对外的侵略”是苏联的“长期利益”。由此可见，美英侵略集团之所以不厌其烦地老调重弹，只是为了一个目的，那就是转移人民对他们扩张原子军备、准备侵略战争的事实的注意。
    美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯去年十月在美国参院拨款委员会中曾经说过：“根据参谋长联席会议的意见，应该利用热核子武器的所有的好处来保证美国的优势。”这些“实力政策”的奉行者企图依靠原子武器的威力来对各国人民发号施令，并且妄想以已经不存在的这种“优势”来对和平民主国家进行讹诈。这不是很明白的么？美英统治集团害怕人民的压力，也装作是主张裁减军备的样子，但是事实证明，它们是在设法阻挠就这个问题取得协议，相反制造紧张空气，以掩护它们继续扩张军备并疯狂地发展原子武器的活动。
    美英集团疯狂地制造和囤积原子武器的行径，只能引起无限制的原子军备竞赛。历史经验无数次证明，军备竞赛只会导致战争的结果。一切头脑清醒的人们绝不会为“核子武器能够增加世界和平的机会”一类的呓语所欺骗。事实上西方原子狂人最近鼓吹原子战争的言行，已在各国人民群众中引起极大的愤慨和不安。印度国会议员萨希布·辛格·索克公开斥责美国阴谋在亚洲“把原子弹用作常规武器的决定”，认为它表明了“西方人想肯定他们的使亚洲殖民地化的主张”。英国议会最近的辩论中也表露了许多英国议员对于邱吉尔演说引起的氢弹战争威胁深感不满。英国著名的科学家和作家亚历山大·康福特在伦敦一个反对准备原子战争的群众集会上指出：英国政府制造氢武器的决定，是裁减军备的又一障碍。可见，世界的公众是看得到究竟谁在阻挠裁军、准备原子战争的。世界的公众看清楚了西方集团鼓吹原子军备竞赛所包含的对各国和平和安全的真正危险，所以他们一致起来要求销毁原子武器。
    原子战争策划者打算用欺骗的喧嚷来淹没全世界要求销毁原子武器的呼声是徒劳无功的。任何烟幕都遮盖不住西方侵略集团准备原子战争的罪恶勾当。全世界爱好和平人民在他们纷纷签字于要求禁止原子武器的宣言上的时候，是清楚地意识到他们这一行动的重大意义的。他们将继续加强斗争，并且坚决相信，人民的力量能够粉碎原子狂人把世界导向原子战争的罪恶阴谋。
