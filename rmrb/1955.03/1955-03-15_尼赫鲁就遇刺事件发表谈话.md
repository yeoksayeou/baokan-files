Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, March 13th: The Tass news agency reports that in view of the various reports circulating about the assassination attempt on him on March 12th, Indian Prime Minister Nehru gave a speech to reporters in Nagpur on the same day to explain the incident.

Nehru said, "I know more about this incident than anyone else, because I was in a better position than anyone to see what happened. At the time, I was standing in an open car, so I could see everything clearly. The car drove into the city from outside the city. The Governor sat on my left, and the Chief Minister sat on my right. At the turn, a rickshaw puller suddenly rushed towards our car. The car stopped. I saw this person. At the time, I thought he might want to present a petition or application to me. When he stepped onto the running board, he was grabbed by the Governor's aide-de-camp and local police. The whole incident only took ten seconds. Don't exaggerate the situation. This was the personal arrogance of a madman, so there is no need to take this matter seriously."

    尼赫鲁就遇刺事件发表谈话
    【新华社讯】塔斯社德里十三日电：印度总理尼赫鲁鉴于对三月十二日他遇刺的事件流传着种种的报道，特于当天在那格浦尔向记者们发表谈话，解释这一事件。
    尼赫鲁说，“我比大家都更了解这桩事件，因为我站在比任何人更有利的位置，看到了所发生的一切。当时我站在一辆敞篷汽车上，所以一切东西我都看得清清楚楚。汽车由城外开进城内。省长坐在我的左边，首席部长坐在我的右边。在转弯的地方，有一个人力车夫突然奔向我们的汽车。汽车停住了。我看到了这个人。当时我想，他可能要呈递请愿书或者申请书给我。当他踏上踏脚板的时候，他就被省长的侍从武官和当地警察抓住了。整个事件只发生了十秒钟。不要夸张事态。这是一个狂人的个人狂妄行为，因而不必重视这件事情。”
