    Tractors Speed Across the Hebei Plain

    The fourteen agricultural machinery stations in Hebei Province have completed their spring plowing preparations. Most stations began providing services to agricultural producers' cooperatives for spring tasks such as plowing, harrowing, and soil consolidation in the middle and latter part of February. According to incomplete statistics from eleven agricultural machinery stations, they have already plowed 7,533 mu of land, harrowed 6,416 mu, and consolidated 14,224 mu. The staff of the Boyan Agricultural Machinery Station in Wu'an County implemented a responsibility system during spring plowing and launched a red flag competition, resulting in the completion of 1,878 mu of spring plowing two days ahead of schedule. On February 15th, the staff of the state-owned Hebei Province Second Agricultural Machinery Station initiated a spring plowing friendship competition with all stations in the province. After the staff of the Xiaoliudian Agricultural Machinery Station in Sanhe County responded to the challenge, the drivers used their ingenuity during production to shorten the idle time of the machinery. By March 2nd, this station had completed the consolidation of more than 2,500 mu of land, increasing the hourly work efficiency by 32 percent compared to the beginning of spring operations this year; the fuel consumption per mu was reduced by 45 percent. During spring plowing, the Gecun Agricultural Machinery Station in Shahe County also trained twelve new farm implement operators for the agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    拖拉机奔驰在河北平原上
    河北省十四个农业机器站已完成春耕准备工作。多数站在二月中、下旬就已开始给服务的农业生产合作社进行耕地、耙地、镇压等项春季作业。据十一个农业机器站的不完全统计：已耕地七千五百三十三亩，耙地六千四百一十六亩，镇压一万四千二百二十四亩。武安县伯延农业机器站的职工们在春耕当中推行了责任制，并开展了红旗竞赛运动，结果提前两天完成了一千八百七十八亩地的春耕任务。二月十五日，国营河北省第二农业机器站的职工们，向全省各站发起了春耕友谊竞赛，三河县小柳店农业机器站的职工们应战后，驾驶员们在生产过程中开动脑筋，缩短了机车空转时间。这个站到三月二日已完成二千五百多亩地的镇压任务，每小时工作效率比今春开始作业时提高了百分之三十二；每亩耗油量降低了百分之四十五。沙河县葛村农业机器站在春耕中，还为农业生产合作社培养了十二名新农具手。
