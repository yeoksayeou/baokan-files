    Prospecting for Phosphate Ore
    Yang Yin
    In an old temple in Kunyang County, Yunnan, lives a team of people prospecting for phosphate ore. Some of them are from Shaanxi and Gansu in the northwest, and some are from Nanjing and Chongqing.
    Spring in Kunyang is windy, especially in the mountains. Every afternoon, the roaring wind seems to want to blow the mountain away, and sand and soil constantly get into people's eyes. But the prospecting team members know that phosphorus is an important raw material for manufacturing chemical fertilizers and other chemical industries. If the ore can be explored clearly sooner, the factory can supply agricultural chemical fertilizers and raw materials for the chemical industry sooner. So they still insist on working. Some work cannot be carried out in strong winds, so they go to the mountains at dawn and work until the wind picks up in the afternoon.
    The team members have begun to get used to life here and are trying their best to do their work better. A trench exploration administrator who had just transferred from the army said to the comrade in charge of mountain work, "I don't understand anything, what should I do?" That comrade replied, "Yes! We also just came out of school not long ago. We only have some book knowledge and very little practical experience. Aren't we learning while doing! Can we ask the country to wait for us to improve?" The next day, the trench exploration administrator began to study while working. In order to ensure the timely start of drilling, the construction workers on the site worked on the site all day long. One day, three people ate breakfast at seven in the morning and did not eat their second meal until eight in the evening. Despite this, they felt very happy after completing the day's task.
    The farmers near the mine gave the exploration team a lot of help. The militiamen of Meishu Village automatically helped the exploration team guard the straw placed on the construction site; when the exploration team needed wood, the farmers sent wood. A woman ran to the construction site and said to the comrades repairing the construction site, "If you need anything, we will definitely mobilize women to help you!"

    勘探磷矿
    杨尹
    在云南昆阳县的一座古庙里，住着一队勘探磷矿的人们。他们有的来自西北的陕西和甘肃，有的来自南京和重庆。
    昆阳的春天多风，尤其是山上，每天下午，怒吼的狂风就像要把山吹走似的，沙土不时地钻进人们的眼睛里。但勘探队员们知道：磷是制造化学肥料及其他化学工业上的重要原料，如果能早一天把矿勘探清楚，工厂就能早一天供给农业化学肥料和化学工业上的原料。所以照样坚持着工作。有些工作不能在大风中进行，他们就在天蒙蒙亮的时候上山去，一直工作到下午起风的时候才停止。
    队员们已经开始习惯这里的生活，并且想尽办法把工作做得好一些。一个刚从部队转业来的槽探管理员向负责山地工作的同志说：“我啥也不懂，怎么办呢？”那位同志回答说：“是呀！我们也是不久前才从学校出来的，光有些书本知识，实际经验很少，还不是边干边学吗！难道能叫国家等着我们提高吗？”第二天，槽探管理员就一边学习，一边开始钻研了。为了保证钻探及时开工，工地上的建筑工人们整天在工地上工作。有一天，有三个人从早上七点钟吃了饭，直到晚上八点钟才吃上第二顿饭，虽然如此，完成了一天的任务以后，他们感到很愉快。
    矿山附近的农民给了勘探队多方面的援助。梅树村的民兵自动帮助勘探队看守放在工地上的稻草；勘探队需要木材，农民们便送木料。有一个妇女跑到工地上对修工地的同志说：“你们需要什么，我们一定发动妇女来帮助你们！”
