    In the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    A Soviet Collective Farm Management Committee Meeting Discusses Developing Publicly Owned Economy
    The Management Committee of the "New Path of Life" Collective Farm in the Moscow Oblast recently held an enlarged meeting to discuss and approve a plan for developing the publicly owned economy of various sectors of the collective farm from 1955 to 1960.
    Bulganin, Mikoyan, and Khrushchev attended the meeting.
    A report was given at the meeting by Aleyev, the chairman of the "New Path of Life" Collective Farm. When discussing the substantial increase in the production of animal husbandry products, he pointed out that the collective farm would focus its primary attention on expanding maize production in order to guarantee a minimum of ten tons of silage per year for each cow in the collective farm's publicly owned livestock and a minimum of five tons of silage for each cow privately owned by the farm members.
    In addition to further developing animal husbandry, the plan also stipulates a significant increase in the yield of vegetables, potatoes, and other crops.
    In 1955, with the help of machine and tractor stations, the harvesting and ensiling of maize stalks, the sowing of vegetable and feed crops, the cultivation of intertilled crops, and the harvesting of pasture grass will all be fully mechanized.
    According to the plan, the total income of the farm in 1955 will reach 2.5 million rubles, an increase of 700,000 rubles compared to 1954. The remuneration for each labor day of the farm members will increase to ten rubles plus seven kilograms of potatoes and vegetables.
    Members of the Farm Management Committee and activists of the farm spoke during the discussion and put forward many valuable suggestions.
    Soviet Lathe Operator Completes Sixteen Years' Quota in Four Years
    Sedov, a high-speed lathe operator at the Penza Machine Manufacturing Plant in the Soviet Union, has completed nearly sixteen years' quota in the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and is now striving to complete twenty years' quota during the entire Five-Year Plan period.
    Sedov is an experienced and advanced worker. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1946-1950), he had completed more than sixteen years' quota. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, his labor productivity has further improved. In 1948, he produced a type of roller for textile machines, producing five in one work shift, while now he can produce twenty-five in one work shift. This means that his labor productivity has increased fourfold during these two Five-Year Plans.
    Sedov works with great rhythm, and he is able to operate according to the operating procedures very accurately for each task. In recent years, he has reduced preparation time by about 50% due to the correct organization of labor. Due to the continuous improvement of the quality of lathe tools, the cutting speed of metal has also been increased by four to eleven times.
    Korean Factories and Mines Complete First Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Due to the highly spirited labor of the workers, enterprises and mines in various regions of Korea are completing their first quarter production targets ahead of schedule.
    The workers in the wire drawing workshop of the Gangseon Steel Plant completed 104% of their first quarter production target on March 11. This year's first quarter production target is already 24% higher than the fourth quarter production target of last year.
    The miners of the Robuk Coal Mine, who are vigorously carrying out a production increase campaign to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule, had already reached 101.2% of their first quarter production target by March 2.
    Railway stations and locomotive drivers are also completing their first quarter quotas one after another. One hundred and forty-one locomotive drivers have already completed their first quarter driving targets.
    Vietnamese People Restore Irrigation System in Thai Binh Province
    The people of Thai Binh Province in the Red River Delta region of Vietnam have begun to restore the entire irrigation system of the province since March 15. The restoration project plans to excavate seven canals, restore sixteen dams, and build four new dams.
    Czechoslovak Youth Voluntarily Sign Up for Land Reclamation
    The number of young people in Czechoslovakia who have voluntarily signed up to participate in land reclamation work in the border areas has increased to 14,500 as of March 16. Among them are factory workers, technicians, office workers, as well as agricultural and pastoral specialists and laboring farmers from various states in the interior.
    Since March 4, young people who have volunteered for land reclamation have left their original jobs and set off for the border areas amid enthusiastic farewells. Many young people have firmly stated that they will learn from the glorious example of the members of the Soviet Komsomol who volunteered to participate in land reclamation, overcome all difficulties, and do a good job in land reclamation.
    Achievements of Romania in Realizing Agricultural Collectivization
    The Romanian people have achieved success in the process of realizing agricultural collectivization.
    Since the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party issued a resolution on carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture in March 1949, about 5,000 collective farms and cooperative farming societies have been established nationwide, including more than 320,000 farm households, cultivating a total of more than 1.1 million hectares of land (each hectare is equivalent to 15 Chinese mu). In the main agricultural areas—Bucharest State and Craiova State—the collectivization movement has developed even faster.
    As a result of being organized for collective farming, the yield per hectare of the main crops of collective farms is higher than that of individual farmers. Last year, the maize yield per hectare of many collective farms reached 3,000 kilograms. The good harvests of collective farms have encouraged more individual farmers to apply to join collective farms. In February of this year, 166 individual farmers in Sânnicolau Mare County joined collective farms.
    At the same time as the progress of agricultural collectivization, the total number of tractors in agriculture has increased to more than five times that of 1949.
    Great Development in the Cultural Life of the Hungarian People
    Approximately four thousand state, county, and township libraries have been established throughout Hungary. In the past year alone, 2,750 kinds of books have been published, with a total circulation of 20 million copies. Hungarian classical literary works, as well as modern works from Hungary and the Soviet Union, have become popular reading material for Hungarian workers, peasants, and youth.
    Newspapers have become a necessity for the people of the whole country. The circulation of "Free People's Daily," the central organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party, alone exceeds 750,000 copies. This figure exceeds the total circulation of all newspapers in Hungary before liberation.
    Many cinemas have been opened in the country. There are about two thousand cultural centers and clubs, scattered in many villages. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    苏联一个集体农庄管理委员会开会讨论发展公有经济
    莫斯科州“新生活之路”集体农庄管理委员会最近举行扩大会议，讨论和通过了一九五五—一九六○年发展集体农庄各部门公有经济的计划。
    布尔加宁、米高扬、赫鲁晓夫参加了这次会议。
      “新生活之路”集体农庄主席阿雷皮耶夫在会上作了报告。他在谈到大大增加畜牧业产品的生产时指出：集体农庄将把主要的注意力放在扩大玉蜀黍生产方面，以便保证农庄的公有牲畜中每头奶牛每年最少有十吨青储饲料，农庄庄员私有的每头奶牛最少有五吨青储饲料。
    除了进一步发展畜牧业以外，计划还规定大大增加蔬菜、马铃薯和其他作物的产量。
    一九五五年，在机器拖拉机站的帮助下，玉蜀黍秆的收割和青储、蔬菜和饲料作物的播种、中耕作物的中耕以及牧草的收割都将完全机械化。
    根据计划，一九五五年农庄的总收入将达到两百五十万卢布，比一九五四年增加七十万卢布。农庄庄员每个劳动日的报酬将增加到十个卢布外加七公斤马铃薯和蔬菜。
    农庄管理委员会的委员和农庄的积极分子在讨论中都发了言，提出了许多宝贵的建议。
    苏联一位车工四年完成十六年定额
    苏联奔萨机器制造厂高速车工塞多夫在第五个五年计划的头四年内已经完成了将近十六年的定额，现在正在争取在整个五年计划期间完成二十年的定额。
    塞多夫是一个有经验的先进工人。在第四个五年计划（一九四六—一九五○年）期间，他曾完成过十六年多的定额。在第五个五年计划期间，他的劳动生产率又进一步提高了。一九四八年，他车制纺织机上的一种滚筒，一个工作班能车制五个，而现在一个工作班就能车制二十五个。这就是说，在这两个五年计划期间，他的劳动生产率提高了四倍。
    塞多夫工作极有节奏，对于每一项任务，他都能够极正确地按操作规程操作。近年内，由于正确地组织劳动，他把准备时间减少了约百分之五十。由于不断提高车刀的质量，又把金属的切削速度提高了四倍到十一倍。
    朝鲜厂矿提前完成第一季度计划
    由于工人们高度奋发的劳动，朝鲜各地区的企业和矿山正在相继提前完成第一季度生产指标。
    降仙炼钢厂的拉丝车间的工人们在三月十一日完成了第一季度的生产指标百分之一百零四。今年第一季度的生产指标比去年第四季度的生产指标已经高出百分之二十四。
    正在大力开展增产竞赛运动来提前完成三年计划的罗北煤矿的矿工们，到三月二日就已经达到了第一季度生产指标的百分之一百零一点二。
    火车站和机车司机们也正在相继完成他们第一季度的定额。有一百四十一名机车司机已经完成了他们第一季度的行车指标。
    越南人民修复太平省水利灌溉系统
    越南红河三角洲地区太平省的人民，已经从三月十五日开始修复这个省的全部水利灌溉系统。修复工程计划开挖七条运河，修复十六道水坝，另外还要新建四道水坝。
    捷克斯洛伐克青年志愿报名垦荒
    捷克斯洛伐克志愿报名到边境地区参加垦荒工作的青年，到三月十六日为止，已经增加到一万四千五百人。他们当中有工厂的工人、技术人员，有机关工作者，也有农牧业专门人才和内地各州的劳动农民。
    从三月四日起，各地志愿垦荒的青年在热情的欢送下已经纷纷离开了原来的工作岗位，启程前往边境地区。许多青年都坚决表示要学习苏联共产主义青年团员们志愿参加开荒工作的光辉榜样，战胜一切困难，作好垦荒工作。
    罗马尼亚实现农业集体化的成就
    罗马尼亚人民在实现农业集体化的过程中取得了成就。
    自从一九四九年三月罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会发布关于进行农业的社会主义改造的决议以来，全国已经成立了约五千个集体农庄和共耕社，包括三十二万多农户，耕种的土地共达一百一十多万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。在主要农业区——布加勒斯特州和克拉约发州，集体化运动发展得更快。
    由于组织起来进行集体耕作的结果，集体农庄的主要作物每公顷的收获量都比个体农民高。去年，许多集体农庄的玉蜀黍每公顷的收获量达到了三千公斤。集体农庄的良好收成鼓舞更多的个体农民申请加入集体农庄。在今年二月份，桑尼科劳马尔县就有一百六十六个个体农民加入了集体农庄。
    和农业集体化的进展同时，农业中的拖拉机总数已经增为一九四九年的五倍多。
    匈牙利人民的文化生活有巨大发展
    匈牙利全国大约共建立了四千个州立、县立和乡立图书馆。仅在过去一年中，就出版了二千七百五十种书籍，发行额共达二千万册。匈牙利古典文学作品、匈牙利和苏联现代作品已经成为匈牙利工人、农民和青年的喜爱读物。
    报纸成为全国人民的必需品。单是匈牙利劳动人民党中央机关报“自由人民报”的发行额就达七十五万份以上。这个数字超过了匈牙利解放以前全国所有报纸的发行总额。
    国内开设了许多电影院。文化馆和俱乐部约有两千个，布满在许多乡村中。  （据新华社讯）
