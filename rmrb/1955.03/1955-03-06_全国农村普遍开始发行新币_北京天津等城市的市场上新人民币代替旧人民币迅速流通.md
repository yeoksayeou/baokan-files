Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: The work of issuing new currency and withdrawing old currency has universally begun in rural areas nationwide. On March 1st, in the counties of Aihui and Huma in Heilongjiang Province on the northern edge of the motherland, in the rural areas of Hainan Island in the south, on the edge of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, and on coastal islands such as the Zhoushan Islands, people joyfully exchanged old currency for new currency. The People's Bank of China has established nearly 30,000 exchange stations in the rural areas of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and other provinces. The activities of the exchange stations have penetrated deeply into rural areas, market towns, and larger villages. The activities of 564 new currency mobile exchange stations in the Huimin, Dezhou, Liaocheng, and Heze Special Districts of Shandong Province are deeply welcomed by farmers. In the past few days, more than 4,000 new currency exchange points distributed in towns and villages of Sichuan Province have exchanged several hundred million yuan of new currency. In Heilongjiang Province, 43 counties and banners, including Keshan, Hailun, Jixian, Fujin, and Guo Hou Banner, exchanged 2,336,000 yuan of new currency on March 1st alone. On March 1st, more than 2,800 farmers in Andong County, Liaoning Province, went to nearby exchange stations to exchange new currency. In addition to exchanges at exchange stations, the amount of new currency exchanged and old currency recovered through transactions by state-owned stores and cooperatives throughout the country is also substantial.

The issuance of new currency has aroused joy among the people of many minority areas. The new currency exchange stations set up in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, and minority areas in Xinjiang, Gansu, Xikang, Sichuan, and other provinces are just as busy these days as the new currency exchange stations in other parts of the country. In Xiahe County, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, the People's Bank exchanged 74,500 yuan of new currency on March 1st. On March 1st, the Li and Miao people who went to Tongshi, the capital of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, to attend the market were all smiles after exchanging for new currency. In Kangding, the capital of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, the Tibetan people who exchanged for new currency liked to recite the Tibetan text on the new currency and praised "Yamre (very good)! Yamre!" repeatedly.

Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: The amount of new currency circulating in the capital's market has accounted for 65 percent of the city's total currency circulation. Almost every resident in the urban area has used the new currency. In mountain villages more than 100 li from the city, such as Sangyu and Jinjitai, many farmers are also taking new currency to cooperatives to buy things. All public and private stores, cooperatives, and dozens of larger shopping malls and vegetable markets in the city have generally used new currency for transactions. People mostly use new currency in trams, buses, and public entertainment venues.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th: The amount of new RMB circulating in the Tianjin market has accounted for 70 percent of the total currency circulation in the market. At present, people generally use new RMB to purchase goods in state-owned stores, cooperatives, private stores, and vegetable markets.

In order to enable citizens to use new RMB more quickly and universally, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank has organized mobile exchange teams and mobile exchange vehicles in recent days to carry out exchange work in remote alleys, outlying areas of the city, and residential areas of workers' families. In the past four days, more than 55,000 people have exchanged more than 2.7 million yuan of new currency at mobile teams.

    【新华社五日讯】全国农村发行新币和收回旧币的工作普遍开始了。三月一日这一天，在祖国北部边缘的黑龙江省瑷珲、呼玛等县，在南部海南岛的农村，在新疆塔里木盆地边缘，在舟山群岛等沿海岛屿上，人民欢欣鼓舞地用旧币换到了新币。中国人民银行在四川、湖南、湖北、江苏、山东、陕西、辽宁、黑龙江等省农村设立的兑换站将近三万个。兑换站的活动深入农村、集镇和较大村庄。山东省惠民、德州、聊城、菏泽等专区五百六十四个新币流动兑换站的活动，深受农民欢迎。这几天，分布在四川省大小城镇和农村的四千多个新币兑换处，已兑出新币数亿元。黑龙江省克山、海伦、集贤、富锦、郭后旗等四十三个县、旗，仅三月一日一天内就兑出新币二百三十三万六千元。辽宁省安东县三月一日一天有二千八百多个农民到附近兑换站去兑换了新币。除了兑换站兑换外，经过遍布全国农村的国营商店和合作社的交易，兑出新币和收回旧币的数量也很大。
    发行新币引起了许多少数民族地区人民的欢欣。设立在内蒙古草原、海南黎族苗族自治区和新疆、甘肃、西康、四川等省少数民族地区的新币兑换站，这几天和祖国其他地区的新币兑换站同样忙碌。在甘南藏族自治区夏河县，人民银行在三月一日就兑出新币七万四千五百元。三月一日，前往海南黎族苗族自治区首府通什赶集的黎族、苗族人民，在兑换到新币后个个喜笑颜开。在西康省藏族自治区首府康定，兑换到新币的藏族人民，都喜欢念念新币上的藏文，并连声称赞“牙姆热（很好）！牙姆热！”
    据新华社五日讯：首都市场上新币的流通量已占全市货币流通量的百分之六十五。城区几乎每一个居民都已使用到新币。距城一百多里的桑峪、金鸡台等山村，很多农民也拿着新币到合作社去买东西。全市所有公、私营商店，合作社和几十个较大商场、菜市场已普遍用新币交易。在电车、公共汽车和公共娱乐场所里，人们大都使用新币。
    据新华社天津五日电：新人民币在天津市场上的流通量已占整个市场货币流通量的百分之七十。目前，在国营商店、合作社、私营商店和菜市场上，人们普遍使用新人民币购买商品。
    人民银行天津分行为了使市民更快地普遍使用新人民币，这几天又组织了流动兑换小组、流动兑换车到偏僻的里巷、市边远地区和工人家属聚居地区进行兑换工作。四天来，有五万五千多人在流动小组兑换了二百七十多万元新币。
