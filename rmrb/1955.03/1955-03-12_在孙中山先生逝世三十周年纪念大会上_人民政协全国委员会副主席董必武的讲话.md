Comrades, friends:

　　Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great democratic revolutionist of modern China. Today, as we commemorate the 30th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we express our highest respect for this great democratic revolutionist.

　　The Chinese people, in order to seek complete liberation from the severe oppression of imperialism and feudalism, carried out a long and arduous struggle, and finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overcame all internal and external enemies, achieved independence and liberation, and opened up a bright road for our motherland to move towards a socialist society. Our countless forerunners have painstakingly pursued a way out for China and have fought heroically to realize the progressive ideals they were able to propose at that time. The liberated Chinese people will always remember these forerunners with respect. Sun Yat-sen was one of the most outstanding representatives among them.

　　Sun Yat-sen began his revolutionary activities around the time of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. At that time, the revolutionary faction headed by Sun Yat-sen launched a revolutionary struggle at a time when the Chinese nation encountered a serious crisis. The direct goal of this revolutionary movement was to overthrow the corrupt rule of the Qing Dynasty, which had become a running dog of foreign imperialism. This revolutionary movement was the first to propose the ideal of a democratic republic to the Chinese people. Sun Yat-sen organized and led the revolutionary movement under very difficult conditions. He had encountered many failures. But he held a firm belief in the righteousness of his cause, and no failure made him retreat.

　　The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty and ended the feudal monarchy that had lasted for more than two thousand years in China. This was the great achievement of the revolutionary faction headed by Sun Yat-sen. Although the Revolution of 1911 did not achieve a complete victory over imperialism and feudalism, nor did it establish the bourgeois democratic republic that the revolutionary faction at that time had envisioned, this revolution played a major role in promoting the awakening of the broad masses of the Chinese people and in disrupting the ruling order of imperialism and feudalism. From then on, imperialism and feudalism could no longer re-establish a stable ruling order, and from then on, the Chinese people's struggle for liberation could not but develop in an increasingly broad and profound direction.

　　After the Revolution of 1911, the democratic revolutionary forces represented by Sun Yat-sen continued to struggle against the Northern Warlords who had usurped the fruits of the Revolution of 1911. Although Sun Yat-sen encountered failures time and again, and felt pain because he could not find a way to achieve victory for the revolution, he did not lay down the banner of struggle.

　　In 1921, the Chinese working class established its own political party and immediately put forward the proposition of organizing a revolutionary united front of national democracy. The Chinese Communist Party was the first to establish contact with the democratic revolutionary faction headed by Sun Yat-sen. At this time, Sun Yat-sen accepted the assistance given to him by the international working class and the Chinese working class, bravely adopted the "three major policies" of uniting with the Soviet Union, uniting with the Communist Party, and supporting the workers' and peasants' movement, and reorganized the Chinese Kuomintang he led on the basis of these three major policies. In this way, this great revolutionist, in the last few years of his life's struggle, was able to rely on the alliance with the socialist Soviet Union, with the Communist Party, and with the revolutionary forces of workers and peasants, to launch a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and against feudalism.

　　Sun Yat-sen was such a great revolutionist: during the period when the bourgeoisie led the Chinese revolution, he persisted in the revolutionary struggle; and when the working class had already stepped onto the historical stage and become the central force of the Chinese revolution, he was the first to recognize this force and was willing to cooperate with this force to fight together for China's independence and liberation.

　　All patriots in China respect Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and consider him a loyal fighter who fought for the freedom and happiness of the motherland.

　　Under the historical conditions of modern and contemporary China, true patriots must adhere to the anti-imperialist stance. Anyone who fears imperialism, dares not conflict with the interests of imperialism, compromises with imperialism, or even tries to curry favor with imperialism, cannot do anything that is truly beneficial to China.

　　Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause was opposed to foreign imperialism from the very beginning, and his anti-imperialist stance became increasingly clear through his life's revolutionary practice.

　　The Revolution of 1911, which overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty, violated the will of foreign imperialism, because the rule of the Qing Dynasty was precisely a tool used by imperialism. The revolutionary faction at that time attempted to enable China to independently develop capitalism, but this was not allowed by imperialism. The imperialists used military and financial power to oppress the Nanjing Provisional Government headed by Sun Yat-sen that emerged from the Revolution of 1911, thus helping the new tool of imperialism—Yuan Shikai—to achieve victory. The Revolution of 1911 ultimately failed. After the Revolution of 1911, the struggle against the warlords led by Sun Yat-sen was also directly and indirectly undermined by foreign imperialism.

　　Thus, two roads were placed before Sun Yat-sen: either to recognize the status quo of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, not to touch this situation, that is, to abandon the aspiration to save China, so that he could obtain the "understanding" and "good feelings" of imperialism; or to insist on changing the semi-colonial and semi-feudal situation of China, insist on fighting for China's independence and freedom, then he could not but directly conflict with the imperialist forces that oppressed and ruled China. Imperialism and its running dogs attempted to force Sun Yat-sen to take the former path. The great patriot Sun Yat-sen, although in very difficult circumstances, refused this path. He chose the latter path.

　　Imperialism is a very powerful force. In order to thoroughly oppose foreign imperialism, it is necessary to find a powerful force that can confront imperialism to rely on. The failure of the Revolution of 1911 precisely reflected the weakness of the revolutionary forces themselves at that time.

　　When the great October Socialist Revolution had already taken place in the world, and the Chinese working class had become an independent political force, Sun Yat-sen finally found a powerful revolutionary force, relying on which he could confront the powerful forces of imperialism. This force is the socialist movement of the international working class, that is, the people's revolutionary movement led by the Chinese working class. Sun Yat-sen reached such a conclusion from the experience of his life's struggle that anyone who is divorced from the workers and peasants, does not rely on the strength of the workers and peasants, cannot promote the revolutionary movement of national independence and democratic freedom, but can only in fact succumb to imperialism.

　　Sun Yat-sen did not compromise and succumb to the temptations and intimidation of imperialism, and dared to unite with the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese workers and peasants to jointly carry out the struggle against imperialism, so Sun Yat-sen was a great patriot.

　　It was certainly not accidental that Sun Yat-sen, starting from bourgeois democratic ideas, became a friend of socialist forces.

　　During the period of the Revolution of 1911, the struggle to establish a bourgeois republic was of progressive significance in China. But during this period, Western capitalism was already on a downward slope, the internal contradictions of the capitalist system had been fully exposed, and the facts had proved that the capitalist system was a disaster for the broad masses of working people. Seeing this situation, it was very natural for the Chinese people, who were suffering from imperialist aggression, to feel aversion to the capitalist system. Sun Yat-sen declared before the Revolution of 1911 that his proposition was to enable China to avoid repeating the mistakes of Europe and the United States, and to avoid the path of capitalism. Sun Yat-sen's thinking was, on the one hand, just a fantasy. The program he put forward at that time was actually to enable China to independently develop capitalism and become a bourgeois democratic republic; on the other hand, his thinking also reflected to a certain extent the subjective wishes of the masses of the people at that time. They did not want the Chinese revolution to result in a situation like that in Western capitalist countries, where a minority of wealthy people oppressed the majority of working people. They yearned for China to become a new society of freedom and equality without exploitation and oppression.

　　But during the period of the Revolution of 1911, the Chinese working class had not yet formed an independent political force, and therefore there was no real force to struggle for the long-term future of socialism. At this time, the Chinese people did not know how to realize the beautiful wish of socialism.

　　The failure of the Revolution of 1911 showed that the Chinese bourgeoisie did not have the strength to defeat imperialism and feudalism, and to independently develop capitalism in China, therefore China could not become a bourgeois democratic republic. People increasingly realized that bourgeois democracy could not save China's destiny.

　　The victory of the Russian October Socialist Revolution greatly strengthened the Chinese people's yearning for socialism. The Chinese Communist Party correctly pointed out the development prospects of the Chinese revolution based on China's social and historical conditions. Although the Chinese revolution could not step directly onto socialism, the result of China's democratic revolution would not be a republic under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, but a democratic state with workers and peasants as the main body, that is, a people's democratic state, from which it could further move towards a socialist society. In this way, a beautiful wish in the hearts of the Chinese people for many years became an ideal that could be realized.

　　The great democratic revolutionist Sun Yat-sen at this time abandoned the plan to transform China according to the model of Western capitalist countries. He did not fear approaching the revolutionary forces of workers and peasants because he saw the prospect of socialism, and he declared that he was a friend of socialism. This is because he had already seen that only by relying on the strength of the workers and peasants could China be saved from the miserable situation of being semi-colonial and semi-feudal, and could a free and happy future be created for the Chinese people.

　　In the thirty years since Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, China has undergone tremendous changes. Our people, who have freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, are working hard to build a new socialist China, which has given our motherland a new look. Socialism is no longer just an ideal for our country, but also a fact of life.

　　The hard work and efforts that countless revolutionary martyrs have made to save China for many years have yielded rich harvests. Our task is to defend the fruits of the revolution and continue to carry them forward. We must be vigilant at all times against the restoration plot of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We must constantly strengthen the people's democratic united front led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and including all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all ethnic groups in the country. We must closely unite the people of the whole country to fight to defend our national defense security, to fight to liberate Taiwan, and to fight to thoroughly complete the great socialist cause in our country. We must fight together with the great Soviet Union, all people's democratic countries, and the peace-loving people of the world to defend world peace.

　　The Chinese people's masses, led by the working class, are the heirs to all progressive causes in Chinese history. Our great motherland is advancing along the socialist road, becoming more prosperous and stronger day by day. This is our best commemoration of the great revolutionist Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    在孙中山先生逝世三十周年纪念大会上
    人民政协全国委员会副主席董必武的讲话诸位同志，诸位朋友：
    孙中山先生是近代中国的伟大的民主主义革命家。今天我们来纪念孙中山先生逝世三十周年，对这位伟大的民主主义革命家表示崇高的敬意。
    中国人民为了从帝国主义和封建主义的严重压迫下求得彻底的解放，进行了长期的艰苦的斗争，终于能够在中国共产党的领导之下，战胜一切内外敌人，取得独立和解放，并且为我们的祖国开辟了走向社会主义社会的光明大路。我们的无数先行者曾经苦心焦虑地追求中国的出路，并且曾经为了实现他们当时所能提出的进步理想而英勇地奋斗。解放了的中国人民永远怀着敬意来怀念这些先行者。孙中山就是他们中间一个最卓越的代表人物。
    孙中山在一八九四年的中日战争前后开始他的革命活动。当时，以孙中山为首的革命派在中国民族遭遇到严重危机的时期发动了革命斗争。这个革命运动的直接目标，是推翻那已经成为外国帝国主义的走狗的清朝的腐朽统治。这个革命运动第一次向中国人民提出了民主共和国的理想。孙中山在非常困难的条件下组织和领导革命运动。他曾遭遇过许多次的失败。但是他对自己的事业的正义性抱着坚强的信心，任何失败都没有使他退却。
    一九一一年的辛亥革命推翻了清朝的统治，结束了中国两千多年来的封建帝制，这是以孙中山为首的革命派的伟大功勋。虽然辛亥革命并没有能够取得对于帝国主义和封建主义的彻底胜利，并没有能够建立当时的革命派所理想的资产阶级民主共和国，但是这一次革命对于推动中国广大人民的觉醒，对于破坏帝国主义和封建主义的统治秩序，是起了重大作用的。从此以后，帝国主义和封建主义再也不可能从新建立稳定的统治秩序，从此以后，中国人民的解放斗争不能不日益向着广泛和深刻的方面发展。
    在辛亥革命以后，以孙中山为代表的民主革命的力量仍旧继续同篡夺了辛亥革命的果实的北洋军阀进行斗争。虽然孙中山一次又一次地遭遇到失败，并且因为找不到能够使革命达到胜利的道路而感到痛苦，但是他并没有放下斗争的旗帜。
    一九二一年，中国工人阶级成立了自己的政党，并且立即提出了组织民族民主的革命统一战线的主张。中国共产党首先就同以孙中山为首的民主革命派建立联系。这时候，孙中山接受了国际工人阶级和中国工人阶级给与他的援助，勇敢地采取了联合苏联、联合共产党、扶助工人运动和农民运动的“三大政策”，并且在这三大政策的基础上改组了他所领导的中国国民党。这样，这位伟大的革命家在他一生奋斗的最后几年中，就能够依靠了同社会主义的苏联，同共产党，同工人和农民的革命力量的联盟，展开了反对帝国主义和反对封建主义的革命斗争。
    孙中山就是这样的一个伟大的革命家：在资产阶级领导中国革命的时期，他坚持了革命斗争；而且在工人阶级已经登上历史舞台，成为中国革命的中心力量的时候，他首先承认了这个力量，并愿意同这个力量合作，共同为中国的独立解放而斗争。
    中国的一切爱国者都尊敬孙中山先生，认为他是为祖国的自由和幸福而奋斗的忠诚的战士。
    在近代和现代中国的历史条件下，真正的爱国者一定要坚持反对帝国主义的立场。任何人，如果害怕帝国主义，不敢同帝国主义的利益发生冲突，同帝国主义妥协，甚至企图巴结帝国主义，那就不可能做出任何真正对中国有益的事情。
    孙中山的革命事业一开始就同外国帝国主义相对立，他的反对帝国主义的立场通过他一生的革命实践而越来越鲜明。
    推翻清朝统治的辛亥革命是违反了外国帝国主义的意愿的，因为清朝的统治正是帝国主义所利用的工具。当时的革命派，企图使中国独立地发展资本主义，但这是帝国主义所不能容许的。帝国主义者利用军事和财政的力量压迫从辛亥革命中产生的以孙中山为首的南京临时政府，这样去帮助帝国主义的新的工具——袁世凯取得了胜利。辛亥革命终于失败了。在辛亥革命以后，孙中山所领导的反对军阀的斗争同样也受到了外国帝国主义的直接和间接的破坏。
    这样，在孙中山的面前，就摆着两条道路：或者是承认半殖民地半封建的中国的现状，不去触犯这种状况，也就是放弃救中国的志愿，这样就能够得到帝国主义的“谅解”和“好感”；或者是坚持要改变中国的半殖民地半封建的状况，坚持要为中国的独立自由而奋斗，那就不能不同压迫和统治中国的帝国主义势力发生直接冲突。帝国主义和它的走狗们企图迫使孙中山走前一条路。伟大的爱国者孙中山虽然处在很困难的境遇中，但是他拒绝了这一条道路。他选择了后一条道路。
    帝国主义是很强大的势力。为了要彻底地反对外国帝国主义，就必须找到一种能够对抗帝国主义的强大力量来做依靠。辛亥革命的失败，正是反映了当时革命力量本身的薄弱。
    在世界上已经发生了伟大的十月社会主义革命，而中国工人阶级已经成为独立的政治力量的时候，孙中山终于找到了一种强大的革命力量，依靠这种力量就能够对抗帝国主义的强大势力。这种力量就是国际工人阶级的社会主义运动，就是中国工人阶级领导的人民革命运动。孙中山从他一生奋斗的经验中达到这样的结论，任何人如果脱离了工人和农民群众，不去依靠工农群众的力量，他就不能推进民族独立和民主自由的革命运动，而只能在实际上屈服在帝国主义的面前。
    孙中山不向帝国主义的诱惑和恐吓表示妥协和屈服，并且敢于同中国共产党和中国的工人和农民群众结合在一起，共同进行反对帝国主义的斗争，所以孙中山是一个伟大的爱国者。
    孙中山从资产阶级民主主义思想出发而成为社会主义力量的朋友，这当然也不是偶然的。
    在辛亥革命时期，建立资产阶级共和国的斗争在中国是有进步意义的。但是在这时期，西方的资本主义已经走着下坡路，资本主义制度的内部矛盾已经充分暴露，事实已经证明，资本主义制度对于广大劳动人民是一种灾害。看到了这种情形，身受着帝国主义侵略的中国人民对于资本主义制度发生反感是很自然的。孙中山在辛亥革命以前就宣布，他的主张是要使中国避免重蹈欧美的覆辙，使中国避开资本主义的道路。孙中山的这种思想就一方面说来不过是一种空想，他当时所提出的纲领其实正是使中国独立地发展资本主义，使中国成为资产阶级的民主共和国；就另一方面说来，他的这种思想也是在一定程度内反映了当时人民群众的主观愿望，他们不愿意使中国革命得到像西方资本主义国家那样由少数富豪压迫大多数劳动人民的结果，他们渴望中国成为没有剥削、没有压迫的自由平等的新社会。
    但是在辛亥革命时期，中国工人阶级还没有形成独立的政治力量，因而也就还没有真正能为社会主义的远大前途奋斗的力量。中国人民这时候不知道究竟怎样才能实现社会主义的美好愿望。
    辛亥革命的失败表明，中国资产阶级没有力量战胜帝国主义和封建主义，并在中国独立地发展资本主义，因此中国也就不可能成为一个资产阶级民主共和国。人们越来越看清楚，资产阶级民主主义并不能够挽救中国的命运。
    俄国十月社会主义革命的胜利大大地加强了中国人民对社会主义的向往。中国共产党根据中国社会历史条件正确地指出了中国革命的发展前途。中国革命虽然不可能一步就走上社会主义，然而中国的民主革命的结果将不是资产阶级专政的共和国，而是以工人农民为主体的民主国家，也就是人民民主国家，由此就可以进一步走向社会主义社会。这样，多少年来中国人民群众心头的一个美好愿望就成为可以实现的理想。
    伟大的民主主义革命家孙中山在这时候放弃了按照西方资本主义国家的模型来改造中国的计划。他并没有因为看到社会主义的远景而害怕接近工人农民的革命力量，他宣布他是社会主义的朋友。这就是因为他已经看出了，只有依靠工人农民群众的力量，才能够把中国从半殖民地半封建的悲惨境地中挽救出来，才能够给中国人民创造自由幸福的前途。
    孙中山先生逝世以后三十年来，中国已经经历了巨大的变化。摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的枷锁的我国人民正在努力建设社会主义的新中国，已经使我们的祖国出现了新的面貌。社会主义对于我国已经不只是一种理想，而且是生活中的事实。
    多少年来，无数的革命志士为拯救中国而付出的辛苦努力已经有了丰富的收获。我们的任务就在于卫护革命的果实，并且继续使它发扬光大。我们一定要时时刻刻警惕着帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石卖国集团的复辟阴谋。我们一定要不断地加强工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，包括各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和国内各民族的人民民主统一战线。我们一定要紧紧团结全国的人民为保卫我们的国防安全而斗争，为解放台湾而斗争，为在我国彻底地完成伟大的社会主义事业而斗争。我们一定要同伟大的苏联，各人民民主国家和全世界爱好和平的人民在一起为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    以工人阶级为领导的中国人民大众是中国历史上一切进步事业的继承人。我们的伟大祖国沿着社会主义的道路前进，一天天更加繁荣强大，这就是我们对于伟大的革命家孙中山先生的最好的纪念。
